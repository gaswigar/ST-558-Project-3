a
final
confession
the
mystery
of
the
sycamore
chapter
i
the
letter
that
said
come
as
the
character
of
a
woman
may
be
accurately
deduced
from
her
handkerchief
so
a
man
s
mental
status
is
evident
from
the
way
he
opens
his
mail
curtis
keefe
engaged
in
this
daily
performance
slit
the
envelopes
neatly
and
laid
the
letters
down
in
three
piles
these
divisions
represented
matters
known
to
be
of
no
great
interest
matters
known
to
be
important
and
third
letters
with
contents
as
yet
unknown
and
therefore
of
problematical
value
the
first
two
piles
were
as
usual
dispatched
quickly
and
the
real
attention
of
the
secretary
centred
with
pleasant
anticipation
on
the
third
lot
gee
whiz
genevieve
as
no
further
pearls
of
wisdom
fell
from
the
lips
of
the
engrossed
reader
of
letters
the
stenographer
gave
him
a
glance
and
then
continued
her
work
curtis
keefe
was
of
course
called
curt
by
his
intimates
and
while
it
may
be
the
obvious
nickname
was
brought
about
by
his
short
and
concise
manner
of
speech
it
is
more
probable
that
the
abbreviation
was
largely
responsible
for
his
habit
of
curtness
anyway
keefe
had
long
cultivated
a
crisp
abrupt
style
of
conversation
that
is
until
he
fell
in
with
samuel
appleby
that
worthy
while
in
the
act
of
engaging
keefe
to
be
his
confidential
secretary
observed
they
call
you
curt
do
they
well
see
to
it
that
it
is
short
for
this
was
only
one
of
several
equally
sound
bits
of
advice
from
the
same
source
and
as
keefe
had
an
eye
single
to
the
glory
of
he
kept
all
these
things
and
pondered
them
in
his
heart
the
result
was
that
ten
years
of
association
with
lawyer
appleby
had
greatly
improved
the
young
man
s
manner
and
though
still
brief
of
speech
his
curtness
had
lost
its
unpleasantly
sharp
edge
and
his
courtesy
had
developed
into
a
dignified
urbanity
so
that
though
still
curt
keefe
it
was
in
name
only
what
s
the
pretty
letter
all
about
curtie
asked
the
observant
stenographer
who
had
noticed
his
third
reading
of
the
short
missive
you
ll
probably
answer
it
soon
and
then
you
ll
know
was
the
reply
as
keefe
restored
the
sheet
to
its
envelope
and
took
up
the
next
letter
genevieve
lane
produced
her
and
became
absorbed
in
its
possibilities
i
wish
i
didn
t
have
to
work
she
sighed
i
wish
i
was
an
opera
cromwell
i
charge
thee
fling
away
ambition
murmured
keefe
his
eyes
still
scanning
letters
by
that
sin
fell
the
angels
and
it
s
true
you
are
angelic
viva
so
down
you
ll
go
if
you
fall
for
how
you
talk
ambition
is
a
good
only
when
tempered
by
common
sense
and
of
which
you
possess
to
a
marked
pooh
you
re
ambitious
yourself
with
the
qualifications
look
here
viva
here
s
a
line
for
you
to
remember
i
ran
across
it
in
a
book
if
you
do
only
what
is
absolutely
correct
and
say
only
what
is
absolutely
can
do
anything
you
how
s
that
i
don
t
see
any
sense
in
it
at
no
i
told
you
you
lacked
common
sense
most
women
huh
and
genevieve
tossed
her
pretty
head
patted
her
curly
and
proceeded
with
her
work
samuel
appleby
s
beautiful
home
graced
the
town
of
stockfield
in
the
western
end
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
former
governor
appleby
was
still
a
political
power
and
a
man
of
unquestioned
force
and
importance
it
was
fifteen
years
or
more
since
he
had
held
office
and
now
a
great
desire
possessed
him
that
his
son
should
follow
in
his
ways
and
that
his
beloved
state
should
know
another
governor
of
the
appleby
name
and
young
sam
was
worthy
of
the
people
s
choice
himself
a
man
of
forty
motherless
from
childhood
and
brought
up
sensibly
and
well
by
his
father
he
listened
gravely
to
the
paternal
plans
for
the
campaign
but
there
were
other
candidates
and
not
without
some
strong
and
definite
influences
could
the
end
be
attained
wherefore
appleby
was
quite
as
much
interested
as
his
secretary
in
the
letter
which
was
in
the
morning
s
mail
any
word
from
sycamore
ridge
he
asked
as
he
came
into
the
big
cheerful
office
and
nodded
a
kindly
to
his
two
assistants
yes
and
a
good
word
returned
keefe
smiling
it
says
the
secretary
s
attitude
toward
his
employer
though
deferential
and
respectful
was
marked
by
a
touch
of
not
unnatural
outgrowth
of
a
long
term
of
confidential
relations
between
them
keefe
had
made
himself
invaluable
to
samuel
appleby
and
both
men
knew
it
so
as
one
had
no
desire
to
presume
on
the
fact
and
the
other
no
wish
to
ignore
it
serenity
reigned
in
the
and
offices
of
the
even
the
and
genevieve
couldn
t
disturb
the
even
tenor
of
the
routine
if
she
could
have
she
would
have
been
fired
though
not
a
handsome
man
not
even
to
be
called
distinguished
looking
samuel
appleby
gave
an
impression
of
power
his
strong
lean
face
betokened
obdurate
determination
and
implacable
will
its
lines
were
the
result
of
meeting
many
obstacles
and
surmounting
most
of
them
and
at
the
hale
and
hearty
frame
and
the
alert
efficient
manner
made
the
man
seem
years
younger
you
know
the
conditions
on
which
wheeler
lives
in
that
house
appleby
asked
as
he
looked
over
the
top
of
the
letter
at
keefe
no
well
it
s
this
way
but
ll
not
give
you
the
story
now
we
re
going
down
the
whole
tribe
asked
keefe
briefly
yes
all
three
of
us
be
ready
miss
lane
please
at
yes
sir
said
genevieve
reaching
for
her
and
now
keefe
as
to
young
sam
appleby
went
on
running
his
fingers
through
his
thick
mane
if
he
can
put
it
over
or
if
i
can
put
it
over
for
him
it
will
be
only
with
the
help
of
dan
is
wheeler
willing
to
help
probably
not
he
must
be
made
willing
i
can
do
he
turns
stubborn
i
know
he
turns
balaam
s
historic
quadruped
had
nothing
on
him
does
wheeler
know
sam
no
and
it
wouldn
t
matter
either
way
if
he
did
it
s
the
platform
wheeler
stands
on
if
i
can
keep
him
in
ignorance
of
that
one
you
can
i
know
it
he
opposed
my
election
on
that
one
ll
oppose
sam
s
for
the
same
reason
i
where
do
i
come
in
in
a
general
way
i
want
your
help
wheeler
s
wife
and
daughter
are
attractive
and
you
might
manage
to
interest
them
and
maybe
sway
their
sympathies
toward
but
they
ll
stand
by
wheeler
however
use
your
head
and
do
all
you
can
with
and
where
do
i
come
in
asked
genevieve
who
had
been
an
interested
listener
you
don
t
come
in
at
all
miss
you
mostly
stay
out
you
re
to
keep
in
the
background
i
have
to
take
you
for
we
re
only
staying
one
night
at
sycamore
ridge
and
then
going
on
to
boston
and
i
ll
need
you
yes
sir
and
the
blue
eyes
turned
from
him
and
looked
absorbedly
into
a
tiny
mirror
as
genevieve
contemplated
her
pleasant
her
vanity
and
its
accompanying
box
were
matters
of
indifference
to
appleby
and
to
keefe
for
the
girl
s
efficiency
and
skill
outweighed
them
and
her
diligence
and
loyalty
scored
one
hundred
per
cent
appleby
s
fetish
was
efficiency
he
had
found
it
and
recognized
it
in
his
secretary
and
stenographer
and
he
was
willing
to
recompense
it
duly
even
generously
wherefore
the
law
business
of
samuel
appleby
though
carried
on
for
the
benefit
of
a
small
number
of
clients
was
of
vast
importance
and
productive
of
lucrative
returns
at
present
the
importance
was
overshadowed
by
the
immediate
interest
of
a
campaign
which
if
successful
would
land
the
second
appleby
in
the
gubernatorial
chair
this
plan
as
yet
not
a
boom
was
taking
shape
with
the
neatness
and
dispatch
that
characterized
the
appleby
work
young
sam
was
content
to
have
the
matter
principally
in
his
father
s
hands
and
things
had
reached
a
pitch
where
to
the
senior
mind
the
co√∂peration
of
daniel
wheeler
was
imperatively
necessary
and
therefore
to
wheeler
s
house
they
must
betake
themselves
what
do
you
know
about
the
wheeler
business
kid
keefe
inquired
after
appleby
had
left
them
genevieve
leaned
back
in
her
chair
her
dimpled
chin
moving
up
and
down
with
a
pretty
rhythm
as
she
enjoyed
her
and
gazed
at
the
ceiling
beams
appleby
s
offices
were
in
his
own
house
and
the
one
given
over
to
these
two
was
an
attractive
room
fine
with
mahogany
and
plate
glass
but
also
provided
with
all
the
paraphernalia
of
the
most
of
office
furniture
there
were
good
pictures
and
draperies
and
a
wood
fire
added
to
the
cheer
and
mitigated
the
chill
of
the
early
fall
weather
sidling
from
her
seat
miss
lane
moved
over
to
a
chair
near
the
fire
i
ll
take
those
letters
when
you
re
ready
she
said
why
i
don
t
know
a
single
thing
about
any
wheeler
do
you
not
definitely
he
s
a
man
who
had
an
awful
fight
with
appleby
long
ago
i
ve
heard
allusions
to
him
now
and
then
but
i
know
no
i
either
but
it
seems
we
re
to
go
there
only
for
a
night
and
then
on
to
boston
won
t
i
be
glad
to
go
we
ll
only
be
there
a
few
days
i
m
more
interested
in
this
wheeler
performance
i
don
t
understand
it
who
s
wheeler
anyhow
dunno
if
sammy
turns
up
this
morning
he
may
enlighten
sammy
did
turn
up
and
not
long
after
the
conversation
young
appleby
strolled
into
the
office
though
still
looked
upon
as
a
boy
by
his
father
the
man
was
of
huge
proportions
and
of
an
important
slightly
overbearing
attitude
somewhat
like
his
parent
in
appearance
young
sam
as
he
was
always
called
had
more
grace
and
ease
if
less
effect
of
power
he
smiled
genially
and
impartially
he
seemed
cordial
and
friendly
to
all
the
world
and
he
was
a
general
favorite
yet
so
far
he
had
achieved
no
great
thing
had
no
claim
to
any
especial
record
in
public
or
private
life
at
forty
unmarried
and
unattached
his
was
a
case
of
an
able
mentality
and
a
firm
reliable
character
with
no
opportunity
offered
to
prove
its
worth
a
little
more
initiative
and
he
would
have
made
opportunities
for
himself
but
a
nature
that
took
the
line
of
least
resistance
a
philosophy
that
believed
in
a
calm
acceptance
of
things
as
they
came
left
samuel
appleby
junior
pretty
much
where
he
was
when
he
began
if
no
man
could
say
aught
against
him
equally
surely
no
man
could
say
anything
very
definite
for
him
yet
many
agreed
that
he
was
a
man
whose
powers
would
develop
with
acquired
responsibilities
and
already
he
had
a
following
hello
little
one
he
greeted
genevieve
carelessly
as
he
sat
down
near
keefe
i
say
old
chap
you
re
going
down
to
the
wheelers
i
yes
this
afternoon
and
the
secretary
looked
up
inquiringly
well
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
know
the
governor
s
going
there
to
get
wheeler
s
aid
in
my
election
boom
and
i
can
tell
you
a
way
to
help
things
along
if
you
agree
see
not
yet
but
go
well
it
s
this
way
dan
wheeler
s
daughter
is
devoted
to
her
father
not
only
filial
respect
and
all
that
but
she
just
fairly
idolizes
the
old
man
now
he
recips
of
course
and
what
she
says
goes
m
asking
you
t
you
put
in
a
good
word
to
maida
that
s
the
if
you
do
it
with
your
inimitable
dexterity
and
grace
she
ll
fall
for
you
mean
for
me
to
praise
you
up
to
miss
wheeler
and
ask
her
father
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
his
influence
how
clearly
you
do
put
things
that
s
exactly
what
i
mean
it
s
no
harm
you
the
most
innocent
sort
of
rather
laughed
keefe
if
all
electioneering
were
as
innocent
as
that
the
word
would
carry
no
unpleasant
then
you
ll
do
it
of
course
i
i
get
oh
you
ll
have
that
it
s
a
big
rambling
country
delightful
one
there
s
tea
in
the
hall
and
tennis
on
the
lawn
and
moonlight
on
the
hold
up
sam
keefe
warned
him
is
the
girl
pretty
haven
t
seen
her
for
years
but
probably
yes
but
that
s
nothing
to
you
you
re
working
for
me
you
appleby
s
glance
was
direct
and
keefe
understood
of
course
i
was
only
joking
i
ll
carry
out
your
commission
if
as
i
said
i
get
the
chance
tell
me
something
of
oh
he
s
a
good
old
chap
pathetic
rather
you
see
he
bumped
up
against
dad
once
and
got
the
worst
of
how
sam
appleby
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
i
see
you
don
t
know
the
story
but
it
s
no
secret
and
you
may
as
well
be
told
you
listen
too
miss
lane
but
there
s
no
call
to
i
ll
go
home
if
you
say
so
genevieve
piped
up
a
little
crisply
no
sit
still
why
it
was
while
dad
was
fifteen
years
ago
i
suppose
and
daniel
wheeler
forged
a
is
he
said
he
didn
t
but
twelve
other
good
and
true
peers
of
his
said
he
did
anyway
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
but
father
was
a
good
friend
of
his
and
being
governor
he
pardoned
wheeler
but
the
pardon
was
on
i
t
dad
ever
told
you
keefe
then
maybe
i
d
better
leave
it
for
him
to
tell
if
he
wants
you
to
know
he
ll
tell
you
and
if
not
i
mustn
oh
goodness
cried
genevieve
what
a
way
to
do
get
us
all
excited
over
a
thrilling
tale
and
then
chop
it
off
short
go
on
with
it
said
keefe
but
appleby
said
no
i
won
t
tell
you
the
condition
of
the
pardon
but
the
two
men
haven
t
been
friends
since
and
won
t
be
unless
the
condition
is
removed
of
course
dad
can
t
do
it
but
the
present
governor
can
make
the
pardon
complete
and
would
do
so
in
a
minute
if
dad
asked
him
to
so
though
he
hasn
t
said
so
the
assumption
is
that
father
expects
to
trade
a
full
pardon
of
friend
wheeler
for
his
help
in
my
and
a
good
plan
keefe
nodded
his
satisfaction
but
sam
went
on
the
trouble
is
that
the
very
same
points
and
principles
that
made
wheeler
oppose
my
father
s
election
will
make
him
oppose
mine
the
party
is
the
same
the
platform
is
the
same
and
i
can
t
hope
that
the
man
wheeler
is
not
the
same
stubborn
adamant
unbreakable
old
hickory
knot
he
was
the
other
and
so
you
want
me
to
soften
him
by
persuading
his
daughter
to
line
up
on
our
side
just
that
keefe
and
you
can
do
it
i
am
i
ll
try
of
course
but
i
doubt
if
even
a
favorite
daughter
could
influence
the
man
you
let
me
help
broke
in
the
irrepressible
genevieve
i
can
do
lots
with
a
girl
i
can
do
more
than
curt
could
i
ll
chum
up
with
her
now
miss
lane
you
keep
out
of
this
i
don
t
believe
in
mixing
women
and
but
miss
wheeler
s
a
and
i
don
t
want
her
troubled
with
politics
keefe
here
can
persuade
her
to
coax
her
father
just
through
her
don
t
want
her
enlightened
as
to
any
of
the
political
details
and
i
can
t
think
your
influence
would
work
half
as
well
as
that
of
a
man
moreover
keefe
has
discernment
and
if
it
isn
t
a
good
plan
after
all
he
ll
know
enough
to
discard
you
d
blunder
ahead
blindly
and
queer
the
whole
game
oh
well
and
bridling
with
offended
pride
genevieve
sought
refuge
in
her
little
mirror
now
don
t
get
huffy
and
sam
smiled
at
her
you
ll
probably
find
that
miss
wheeler
s
complexion
is
finer
than
yours
anyway
and
then
you
ll
hate
her
and
won
t
want
to
speak
to
her
at
miss
lane
flashed
an
indignant
glance
and
then
proceeded
to
go
on
with
her
work
hasn
t
wheeler
tried
for
a
pardon
all
this
time
keefe
asked
indeed
he
has
sam
returned
many
times
but
you
see
though
successive
governors
were
willing
to
grant
it
father
always
managed
to
prevent
it
dad
can
pull
lots
of
wires
as
you
know
and
since
he
doesn
t
want
wheeler
fully
pardoned
why
he
doesn
t
get
fully
and
he
lives
under
the
lots
of
people
don
t
know
about
the
thing
at
all
he
lives
in
of
course
there
is
a
certain
and
your
father
will
bring
about
his
full
pardon
if
he
let
up
keefe
i
ve
said
i
can
t
tell
you
that
ll
get
your
instructions
in
good
time
and
look
here
i
don
t
mean
for
you
to
make
love
to
the
girl
in
fact
i
m
told
she
has
a
suitor
but
you
re
just
to
give
her
a
little
song
and
dance
about
my
suitability
for
the
election
and
then
adroitly
persuade
her
to
use
her
powers
of
persuasion
with
her
stubborn
father
for
he
will
be
know
it
and
there
s
the
mother
of
the
girl
tackle
wheeler
make
her
see
that
my
father
was
justified
in
the
course
he
besides
he
was
more
or
less
accountable
to
use
as
an
argument
that
years
have
dulled
the
old
feud
and
that
bygones
ought
to
be
bygones
and
all
that
try
to
make
her
see
that
a
full
pardon
now
will
be
as
much
and
in
a
way
more
to
wheeler
s
credit
than
if
it
had
been
given
him
at
i
can
t
see
that
and
keefe
looked
quizzical
neither
can
i
sam
confessed
frankly
but
you
can
make
a
woman
swallow
depends
on
what
sort
of
woman
wheeler
is
keefe
mused
i
know
it
i
haven
t
seen
her
for
years
and
as
i
remember
she
s
pretty
keen
but
i
m
banking
on
you
to
put
over
some
of
your
clever
work
not
three
men
in
boston
have
your
ingenuity
keefe
when
it
comes
to
sizing
up
a
situation
and
knowing
just
how
to
handle
it
now
don
t
tell
father
all
i
ve
said
for
he
doesn
t
especially
hold
with
such
small
measures
he
s
all
for
the
one
big
slam
game
and
he
may
be
right
but
i
m
right
too
and
you
just
go
all
right
keefe
agreed
i
see
what
you
mean
and
i
ll
do
all
i
can
that
doesn
t
in
any
way
interfere
with
your
father
s
directions
to
me
there
s
a
possibility
of
turning
the
trick
through
the
women
folks
and
if
i
can
do
it
you
may
count
on
good
and
as
for
you
miss
lane
you
keep
in
the
background
and
make
as
little
mischief
as
you
i
m
not
a
said
the
girl
pouting
playfully
for
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
sam
appleby
your
blue
eyes
and
pink
cheeks
make
mischief
wherever
you
go
he
returned
but
don
t
try
them
on
old
dan
wheeler
he
s
a
morose
old
i
should
think
he
would
be
defended
genevieve
living
all
these
years
under
a
ban
which
may
after
all
be
undeserved
i
ve
heard
that
he
was
entirely
innocent
of
the
forgery
have
you
indeed
appleby
s
tone
was
unpleasantly
sarcastic
other
people
have
also
heard
the
wheeler
family
those
better
informed
believe
the
man
guilty
and
believe
too
that
my
father
was
too
lenient
when
he
granted
even
a
conditional
but
just
he
was
awful
his
life
has
been
all
these
years
you
bet
he
ll
accept
the
full
pardon
and
give
all
his
effort
and
influence
and
any
possible
help
in
hear
the
child
orate
exclaimed
sam
gazing
at
the
enthusiastic
little
face
as
genevieve
voiced
her
views
i
think
he
ll
be
ready
to
make
the
bargain
too
declared
keefe
your
father
has
a
strong
argument
i
fancy
wheeler
s
jump
at
the
so
but
you
don
t
know
how
opposed
he
is
to
our
principles
and
he
s
a
man
of
immovable
convictions
in
fact
he
and
dad
are
two
mighty
strong
forces
one
or
the
other
must
win
i
ve
no
idea
which
it
will
how
exciting
genevieve
s
eyes
danced
i
m
so
glad
i
m
to
go
it
s
a
pretty
place
you
say
wonderful
a
great
sweep
of
rolling
country
a
big
long
rambling
sort
of
house
and
a
splendid
hospitality
you
ll
enjoy
the
experience
but
remember
i
told
you
to
be
i
will
remember
and
genevieve
pretended
to
took
cherubic
chapter
ii
north
door
and
south
door
for
samuel
appleby
to
pay
a
visit
to
daniel
wheeler
was
of
itself
an
astounding
occurrence
the
two
men
had
not
seen
each
other
since
the
day
fifteen
years
ago
when
governor
appleby
had
pardoned
the
convicted
wheeler
with
a
condition
which
though
harsh
had
been
strictly
adhered
to
they
had
never
been
friends
at
heart
for
they
were
diametrically
opposed
in
their
political
views
and
were
not
of
similar
tastes
or
pursuits
but
they
had
been
thrown
much
together
and
when
the
time
came
for
wheeler
to
be
tried
for
forgery
appleby
lent
no
assistance
to
the
case
however
through
certain
influences
brought
to
bear
in
connection
with
the
fact
that
wheeler
was
related
to
the
applebys
the
governor
pardoned
the
condemned
man
with
a
conditional
pardon
separated
ever
since
a
few
letters
had
passed
between
the
two
men
but
they
resulted
in
no
change
of
conditions
as
the
big
car
ran
southward
through
the
berkshire
hills
appleby
s
thoughts
were
all
on
the
coming
meeting
and
the
scenery
of
autumn
foliage
that
provoked
wild
exclamations
of
delight
from
genevieve
and
assenting
enthusiasm
from
keefe
left
the
other
unmoved
an
appreciative
nod
and
grunt
were
all
he
vouchsafed
to
the
girl
s
gushing
praises
and
when
at
last
they
neared
their
destination
he
called
her
attention
to
a
tall
old
sycamore
tree
standing
alone
on
a
ridge
not
far
away
that
s
the
tree
that
gives
the
wheeler
place
its
name
he
informed
sycamore
ridge
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
places
in
oh
are
we
in
connecticut
asked
miss
lane
i
didn
t
know
we
had
crossed
the
border
what
a
great
old
tree
surely
one
of
the
historic
trees
of
new
england
isn
t
it
historic
to
the
wheelers
was
the
grim
reply
and
then
appleby
again
relapsed
into
silence
and
spoke
no
further
word
until
they
reached
the
wheeler
home
a
finely
curved
sweep
of
driveway
brought
them
to
the
house
and
the
car
stopped
at
the
south
entrance
the
door
did
not
swing
open
in
welcome
and
appleby
ordered
his
chauffeur
to
ring
the
bell
this
brought
a
servant
in
response
and
the
visiting
trio
entered
the
house
it
was
long
and
low
with
many
rooms
on
either
side
of
the
wide
hall
that
went
straight
through
from
south
to
north
the
first
room
to
the
right
was
a
large
and
into
this
the
guests
were
shown
and
were
met
by
a
man
who
neither
smiled
nor
offered
a
hand
as
his
calm
gaze
rested
on
samuel
appleby
indeed
the
two
men
stared
at
one
another
in
undisguised
curiosity
each
seemed
to
search
the
other
s
face
for
information
as
to
his
attitude
and
intent
well
dan
appleby
said
after
the
silent
scrutiny
you
ve
changed
some
but
you
re
the
same
chap
you
always
wheeler
gave
a
start
and
pulled
himself
together
thank
you
i
suppose
i
should
return
the
but
you
can
t
conscientiously
do
it
eh
appleby
laughed
never
mind
personal
vanity
is
not
my
besetting
sin
this
is
my
secretary
keefe
and
my
assistant
miss
ah
yes
yes
how
are
you
how
do
you
do
my
wife
and
daughter
will
look
after
the
young
lady
maida
as
if
awaiting
the
call
a
girl
came
quickly
in
from
the
hall
followed
by
an
older
woman
introductions
followed
and
if
there
was
an
air
of
constraint
on
the
part
of
the
host
the
ladies
of
the
family
showed
none
maida
wheeler
with
her
laughing
brown
eyes
and
gold
brown
hair
greeted
the
visitors
with
charming
cordiality
and
her
mother
was
equally
kind
and
courteous
genevieve
lane
s
wise
and
appraising
eyes
missed
no
point
of
appearance
or
behavior
perfect
darlings
both
of
them
she
commented
to
herself
whatever
ails
the
old
guy
it
hasn
t
bitten
them
or
a
genevieve
was
very
perhaps
they
re
putting
on
a
little
is
their
welcome
a
bit
extra
to
help
things
along
yet
only
a
most
meticulous
critic
could
discern
anything
more
than
true
hospitality
in
the
attitude
of
wheeler
or
maida
the
latter
took
genevieve
to
the
room
prepared
for
her
and
chatted
away
in
girlish
fashion
the
place
is
so
wonderful
genevieve
exclaimed
carefully
avoiding
personal
talk
don
t
you
just
adore
it
oh
yes
i
ve
loved
sycamore
ridge
for
nearly
fifteen
have
you
lived
here
so
long
genevieve
was
alert
for
information
it
was
fifteen
years
ago
that
the
pardon
had
been
granted
but
as
maida
merely
assented
and
then
changed
the
subject
miss
lane
was
far
too
canny
to
ask
further
questions
with
a
promptness
not
entirely
due
to
chance
the
stenographer
came
downstairs
dressed
for
dinner
some
several
minutes
before
the
appointed
hour
assuming
her
right
as
a
guest
she
wandered
about
the
rooms
the
south
door
by
which
they
had
entered
was
evidently
the
main
entrance
but
the
opposite
or
north
door
gave
on
to
an
even
more
beautiful
view
and
she
stepped
out
on
the
wide
veranda
and
gazed
admiringly
about
the
low
ridge
nearby
formed
the
western
horizon
and
the
giant
sycamore
its
straight
branches
outlined
against
the
fading
sunset
was
impressive
and
a
little
weird
she
strolled
on
and
turned
the
corner
the
better
to
see
the
ridge
the
veranda
ran
all
round
the
house
and
as
she
went
on
along
the
western
side
she
suddenly
became
aware
of
a
silent
figure
leaning
against
a
pillar
at
the
southwest
corner
it
is
so
quiet
it
frightens
me
she
said
to
daniel
wheeler
as
she
neared
him
do
you
feel
that
way
too
he
asked
looking
at
her
a
little
absently
it
is
the
lull
before
the
oh
that
sunset
doesn
t
mean
rain
genevieve
exclaimed
smiling
unless
your
connecticut
blue
laws
interpret
weather
signs
differently
from
our
massachusetts
prophets
we
in
connecticut
aren
t
we
yes
and
wheeler
sighed
unaccountably
yes
miss
lane
we
are
that
sycamore
is
the
finest
tree
in
the
i
can
well
believe
it
i
never
saw
such
a
grandfather
of
a
tree
it
s
all
full
of
little
yes
buttonballs
they
are
called
but
note
its
wonderful
symmetry
its
majestic
and
strength
it
looks
as
if
it
would
stand
there
forever
do
you
think
so
and
the
unmistakable
note
of
disappointment
in
the
man
s
tone
caused
genevieve
to
look
up
in
astonishment
well
perhaps
it
will
he
added
quickly
oh
no
of
course
it
won
t
really
no
tree
stands
forever
but
it
will
be
here
long
after
you
and
i
are
are
you
an
authority
on
trees
wheeler
spoke
without
a
smile
hardly
that
but
i
was
brought
up
in
the
country
and
i
know
something
of
them
your
daughter
loves
the
country
oh
all
the
tone
was
courteous
but
the
whole
air
of
the
man
was
so
melancholy
his
cheerfulness
so
palpably
assumed
that
genevieve
felt
sorry
for
him
as
well
as
inordinately
curious
to
know
what
was
the
matter
but
her
sympathy
was
the
stronger
impulse
and
with
a
desire
to
entertain
him
she
said
come
for
a
few
steps
in
the
garden
wheeler
won
t
you
come
and
show
me
that
quaint
little
near
the
front
door
it
is
the
front
door
isn
t
it
it
s
hard
to
yes
the
north
door
the
front
door
wheeler
said
slowly
as
if
repeating
a
lesson
the
you
mention
is
near
the
front
door
but
we
won
t
visit
that
now
come
this
other
way
and
i
ll
show
you
a
japanese
much
more
but
genevieve
lane
was
sometimes
under
the
spell
of
the
imp
of
the
perverse
no
no
she
begged
smilingly
let
the
japanese
contraption
wait
please
go
to
the
little
now
see
how
it
fairly
twinkles
in
the
last
gleams
of
the
setting
sun
what
is
the
flower
that
rambles
all
over
it
oh
do
let
s
go
there
now
come
please
with
no
reason
for
her
foolish
insistence
save
a
whim
genevieve
was
amazed
to
see
the
look
of
fury
that
came
over
her
host
s
face
appleby
put
you
up
to
that
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
intense
anger
he
told
you
to
ask
me
to
go
to
that
place
why
wheeler
cried
the
girl
almost
frightened
mr
appleby
did
nothing
of
the
sort
why
should
he
i
m
not
asking
anything
wrong
am
i
why
is
it
so
dreadful
to
want
to
see
an
arbor
instead
of
a
you
must
be
crazy
when
miss
lane
was
excited
she
was
quite
apt
to
lose
her
head
and
speak
in
thoughtless
fashion
but
wheeler
didn
t
seem
to
notice
her
informality
of
speech
he
only
stared
at
her
as
if
he
couldn
t
quite
make
her
out
and
then
he
suddenly
seemed
to
lose
interest
in
her
or
her
wishes
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
turned
away
and
fell
into
the
same
brooding
posture
as
when
she
had
first
approached
him
come
to
dinner
people
called
maida
s
pretty
voice
as
with
outstretched
hands
she
came
toward
them
why
dads
what
are
you
looking
miserable
about
what
have
you
done
to
him
miss
lane
maida
child
don
t
speak
like
that
miss
lane
has
been
most
kindly
talking
to
me
the
beauties
of
sycamore
all
right
then
and
forgive
me
miss
lane
but
you
see
the
sun
rises
and
sets
for
me
in
one
daniel
wheeler
esquire
and
any
shadow
on
his
face
makes
me
apprehensive
of
its
only
for
an
instant
did
genevieve
lane
s
sense
of
justice
rise
in
revolt
then
her
common
sense
showed
her
the
better
way
and
she
smiled
pleasantly
and
returned
i
don
t
blame
you
miss
wheeler
if
i
had
a
father
i
should
feel
just
the
same
way
i
know
but
don
t
do
any
my
way
i
assure
you
i
didn
t
really
scold
him
i
only
kicked
because
he
wouldn
t
humor
my
whim
for
visiting
the
with
the
blossoms
trailing
over
it
was
that
naughty
of
me
but
though
genevieve
listened
for
the
answer
none
came
come
on
in
to
dinner
daddy
dear
maida
repeated
come
miss
lane
they
re
waiting
for
dinner
was
a
delightful
occasion
daniel
wheeler
at
the
head
of
his
own
table
was
a
charming
host
and
his
melancholy
entirely
disappeared
as
the
talk
ran
along
on
subjects
grave
or
gay
but
of
no
personal
import
appleby
too
was
entertaining
and
the
two
men
with
wheeler
carried
on
most
of
the
conversation
the
younger
members
of
the
party
being
by
what
seemed
common
consent
left
out
of
it
genevieve
looked
about
the
with
a
pleased
interest
she
dearly
loved
beautiful
appointments
and
was
really
imagining
herself
mistress
of
just
such
a
house
and
visioning
herself
at
the
head
of
such
a
table
the
long
room
stretched
from
north
to
south
parallel
with
the
hall
though
not
adjoining
the
table
was
not
in
the
centre
but
toward
the
southern
end
and
wheeler
at
the
end
near
the
windows
had
keefe
and
miss
lane
on
either
side
of
him
appleby
as
guest
of
honor
sat
at
wheeler
s
right
and
the
whole
effect
was
that
of
a
formal
dinner
party
rather
than
a
group
of
which
two
were
merely
office
employ√©s
it
is
one
of
the
few
remaining
warm
evenings
said
wheeler
as
she
rose
from
the
table
we
will
have
our
coffee
on
the
veranda
soon
it
will
be
too
cool
for
which
veranda
asked
genevieve
of
maida
as
they
went
through
the
hall
the
north
one
i
your
hopes
must
be
dashed
laughed
the
other
for
it
will
be
the
south
one
come
the
two
girls
followed
by
keefe
took
possession
of
a
group
of
chairs
near
wheeler
while
the
two
older
men
sat
apart
and
soon
became
engrossed
in
their
own
discussions
nor
was
it
long
before
samuel
appleby
and
his
host
withdrew
to
a
room
which
opened
on
to
that
same
south
veranda
and
which
was
in
fact
wheeler
s
den
well
sam
keefe
heard
the
other
say
as
he
drew
down
the
blind
we
may
as
well
have
it
out
now
what
are
you
here
for
outwardly
placid
but
almost
consumed
with
curiosity
curt
keefe
changed
his
seat
for
one
nearer
the
window
of
the
den
he
hoped
to
hear
the
discussion
going
on
inside
but
was
doomed
to
disappointment
for
though
the
murmuring
of
the
voices
was
audible
the
words
were
not
distinct
and
keefe
gathered
only
enough
information
to
be
sure
that
there
was
a
heated
argument
in
progress
and
that
neither
party
to
it
was
inclined
to
give
in
a
single
point
of
course
he
decided
the
subject
was
the
coming
election
campaign
but
the
details
of
desired
bargaining
he
could
not
gather
moreover
often
just
as
he
almost
heard
sentences
of
interest
the
chatter
of
the
girls
or
some
remark
of
wheeler
s
would
drown
the
voices
of
the
men
in
the
room
one
time
indeed
he
heard
clearly
when
the
sycamore
on
the
ridge
goes
into
but
this
was
sheer
nonsense
and
he
concluded
he
must
have
misunderstood
later
they
all
forgathered
in
the
and
there
was
music
and
general
conversation
genevieve
lane
proved
herself
decidedly
entertaining
and
though
samuel
appleby
looked
a
little
amusedly
at
his
stenographer
he
smiled
kindly
at
her
as
he
noticed
that
she
in
no
way
overstepped
the
bounds
of
correct
demeanor
genevieve
was
thinking
of
what
keefe
had
said
to
her
if
you
do
only
what
is
absolutely
correct
and
say
what
is
only
absolutely
correct
you
can
do
whatever
you
she
had
called
it
nonsense
at
the
time
but
she
was
beginning
to
see
the
truth
of
it
she
was
careful
that
her
every
word
and
act
should
be
correct
and
she
was
most
decidedly
doing
as
she
liked
she
made
good
with
wheeler
and
maida
with
no
trouble
at
all
but
she
felt
vaguely
that
wheeler
didn
t
like
her
this
she
set
about
to
remedy
going
to
his
side
as
he
chanced
to
sit
for
a
moment
alone
she
smiled
ingratiatingly
and
said
i
wonder
if
you
can
imagine
sir
what
it
means
to
me
to
see
the
inside
of
a
house
like
this
bless
my
soul
what
do
you
mean
asked
wheeler
puzzled
at
the
girl
s
manner
it
s
like
a
glimpse
of
fairyland
she
went
on
you
see
i
m
terribly
fearfully
so
and
all
my
ambitions
lead
to
just
this
sort
of
a
home
do
you
suppose
i
ll
ever
achieve
it
wheeler
now
the
girl
had
truly
wonderful
magnetic
charm
and
even
staid
old
dan
wheeler
was
not
insensible
to
the
note
of
longing
in
her
voice
the
simple
honest
admission
of
her
hopes
of
course
you
will
little
one
he
returned
kindly
i
ve
heard
that
whatever
one
wants
one
gets
provided
the
wish
is
strong
he
spoke
directly
to
her
but
his
gaze
wandered
as
if
his
thoughts
were
far
away
do
you
really
believe
that
genevieve
s
big
blue
eyes
begged
an
affirmation
i
didn
t
say
i
believed
said
i
have
heard
he
smiled
sadly
not
quite
the
far
as
i
m
concerned
but
quite
as
assuring
to
you
of
course
my
belief
wouldn
t
endorse
the
it
would
for
me
declared
genevieve
i
ve
lots
of
confidence
in
other
people
s
anybody
s
anybody
whom
i
respect
and
believe
appleby
for
instance
oh
yes
indeed
i
d
trust
appleby
s
opinions
on
any
subject
let
s
go
over
there
and
tell
him
samuel
appleby
was
sitting
at
the
other
end
the
north
end
of
the
long
room
no
said
wheeler
i
m
too
comfortable
here
to
him
to
come
genevieve
looked
at
him
a
little
astonished
it
was
out
of
order
she
thought
for
a
host
to
speak
thus
she
pressed
the
point
saying
there
was
a
picture
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
she
wished
to
examine
run
along
then
said
wheeler
coolly
here
maida
show
miss
lane
that
etching
and
tell
her
the
interesting
details
about
the
girls
went
away
and
soon
after
keefe
drifted
round
to
wheeler
s
side
you
know
young
sam
appleby
he
asked
casually
no
wheeler
said
shortly
but
not
sharply
i
daresay
he
s
a
most
estimable
he
s
all
of
that
he
s
a
true
chip
of
the
old
block
both
good
gubernatorial
timber
as
i
m
sure
you
what
makes
you
so
sure
keefe
curt
keefe
looked
straight
at
him
well
he
laughed
i
m
quite
ready
to
admit
that
the
wish
was
father
to
the
why
do
you
call
that
an
admission
oh
keefe
readily
returned
it
is
usually
looked
upon
as
a
confession
that
one
has
no
reason
for
a
thought
other
than
a
and
why
is
it
your
wish
because
it
is
the
wish
of
my
employer
said
keefe
seriously
i
know
of
no
reason
wheeler
why
i
shouldn
t
say
that
i
hope
and
trust
you
will
use
your
influence
to
further
the
cause
of
young
what
makes
you
think
i
can
do
so
while
i
am
not
entirely
in
appleby
s
confidence
he
has
told
me
that
the
campaign
would
be
greatly
aided
by
your
willingness
to
help
and
so
i
can
t
help
hoping
you
will
exercise
appleby
has
told
you
so
much
has
he
no
more
no
more
i
think
regarding
yourself
sir
i
know
naturally
the
details
of
the
campaign
so
far
as
it
is
yet
mapped
and
you
know
why
i
do
not
want
to
lend
my
aid
i
know
you
are
not
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
the
appleby
that
i
am
not
nor
shall
i
ever
be
nor
shall
i
ever
pretend
to
pretend
of
course
not
but
could
you
not
be
persuaded
by
what
means
i
don
t
know
wheeler
and
keefe
looked
at
him
frankly
i
truly
don
t
know
by
what
means
but
i
do
know
that
appleby
is
here
to
present
to
you
an
argument
by
which
he
hopes
to
persuade
you
to
help
young
sam
i
earnestly
desire
to
add
any
word
of
mine
that
may
help
influence
your
decision
that
is
why
i
want
to
tell
you
of
the
good
traits
of
sam
appleby
junior
it
may
be
i
can
give
you
a
clearer
light
on
his
character
than
his
father
could
is
i
might
present
it
as
the
opinion
of
a
and
not
exaggerate
his
virtues
as
a
father
might
do
i
see
well
keefe
i
appreciate
your
attitude
but
let
me
tell
you
this
whatever
i
do
or
don
t
do
regarding
this
coming
campaign
of
young
appleby
will
be
entirely
irrespective
of
the
character
or
personality
of
that
young
man
it
will
all
depend
on
the
senior
appleby
s
arrangements
with
me
and
my
ability
to
change
his
views
on
some
of
the
more
important
planks
in
his
platform
if
he
directed
you
to
speak
to
me
as
you
have
done
you
may
return
that
to
him
as
my
you
doubtless
said
the
same
to
him
sir
of
course
i
did
i
make
no
secret
of
my
position
in
this
matter
samuel
appleby
has
a
hold
over
admit
it
is
not
strong
enough
to
make
me
forget
my
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
to
the
public
no
influence
of
a
personal
nature
should
weigh
against
any
man
s
duty
to
the
state
and
i
will
never
agree
to
pretend
to
any
dissimulation
in
order
to
bring
about
a
happier
life
for
but
need
you
subscribe
to
the
objectionable
points
to
use
your
influence
for
young
sam
tacitly
of
course
and
i
do
not
choose
even
to
appear
to
agree
to
principles
abhorrent
to
my
sense
of
justice
and
honesty
thereby
secretly
gaining
something
for
meaning
your
full
pardon
wheeler
turned
a
look
of
surprise
on
the
speaker
i
thought
you
said
you
hadn
t
appleby
s
full
confidence
he
said
nor
have
i
do
do
many
you
were
pardoned
with
a
condition
but
the
condition
i
do
not
know
it
can
t
be
very
and
keefe
looked
about
on
the
pleasant
surroundings
you
think
not
that
s
because
you
don
t
know
the
terms
and
yet
galling
though
they
are
hateful
though
it
makes
my
life
and
the
lives
of
my
wife
and
daughter
we
would
all
rather
bear
it
than
to
deviate
one
iota
from
the
path
of
strict
i
must
admire
you
for
that
as
must
any
honorable
man
but
are
there
not
degrees
or
shadings
of
right
and
mr
keefe
as
an
old
man
i
take
the
privilege
of
advising
you
for
your
own
good
all
through
your
life
i
beg
you
remember
this
anyone
who
admits
degrees
or
shadings
of
right
or
already
wrong
don
t
be
offended
you
didn
t
claim
those
things
you
merely
asked
the
question
but
remember
what
i
said
about
chapter
iii
one
last
argument
adjoining
the
bedroom
of
samuel
appleby
at
sycamore
ridge
was
a
small
also
at
his
disposal
here
later
that
same
evening
he
sat
in
confab
with
his
two
assistants
we
leave
afternoon
he
said
to
keefe
and
miss
lane
but
before
that
we
ve
much
to
do
so
far
we
ve
accomplished
nothing
i
am
a
little
discouraged
but
not
disheartened
i
still
have
a
trump
card
to
play
but
i
don
t
want
to
use
it
unless
absolutely
if
you
were
inclined
to
take
us
further
into
your
confidence
appleby
keefe
began
and
the
older
man
interrupted
that
s
just
what
i
propose
to
do
the
time
has
come
for
it
perhaps
if
you
both
know
the
situation
you
may
work
more
sure
we
could
exclaimed
genevieve
she
was
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
clasping
her
knees
her
pretty
evening
frock
disclosing
her
babyishly
soft
neck
and
arms
but
without
a
trace
of
she
thought
only
of
the
subject
they
were
discussing
there
s
something
queer
she
went
on
i
can
t
see
through
it
why
does
wheeler
act
so
polite
most
of
the
time
and
then
do
some
outrageous
thing
like
what
like
refusing
to
cross
the
he
declined
to
go
with
me
to
the
north
arbor
yet
was
perfectly
willing
to
take
me
to
the
japanese
that
s
just
the
point
of
the
whole
thing
said
appleby
seriously
here
s
the
explanation
in
a
nutshell
years
ago
daniel
wheeler
was
pardoned
for
a
crime
he
had
he
did
commit
it
then
interrupted
keefe
he
was
tried
and
convicted
he
was
sentenced
and
i
being
governor
at
the
time
pardoned
him
on
the
one
condition
that
he
never
again
set
foot
inside
the
boundaries
of
the
state
of
whee
exclaimed
genevieve
never
go
to
boston
nor
anywhere
else
in
the
state
but
this
is
the
complication
wheeler
who
is
by
the
way
a
distant
connection
of
my
own
family
inherited
a
large
fortune
on
condition
that
she
live
in
massachusetts
so
you
see
the
situation
was
peculiar
to
keep
her
inheritance
wheeler
must
live
in
massachusetts
yet
wheeler
could
not
enter
the
state
without
forfeiting
his
what
a
mess
cried
genevieve
but
keefe
said
you
planned
that
purposely
appleby
of
course
was
the
straightforward
reply
then
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
expect
wheeler
s
help
in
the
by
offering
him
a
complete
pardon
of
but
go
on
with
the
story
demanded
genevieve
what
did
they
do
about
the
massachusetts
business
as
you
see
returned
appleby
this
house
is
built
on
the
state
line
between
massachusetts
and
connecticut
it
is
carefully
planned
and
built
and
all
the
rooms
or
parts
of
rooms
that
wheeler
uses
or
enters
are
on
the
connecticut
side
yet
the
house
is
more
than
half
in
massachusetts
which
secures
the
estate
to
well
i
never
genevieve
exclaimed
so
that
s
why
he
can
t
go
to
the
north
s
in
massachusetts
of
course
it
is
also
he
never
goes
into
the
northern
end
of
the
or
the
or
or
hall
in
fact
he
merely
is
careful
to
keep
on
his
own
side
of
a
definitely
drawn
line
and
therefore
complies
with
the
restrictions
his
den
and
his
own
bedroom
and
bath
are
all
on
the
south
side
while
wheeler
has
a
boudoir
and
so
forth
on
the
north
side
she
and
maida
can
go
all
over
the
house
but
wheeler
is
restricted
however
they
ve
lived
that
way
so
long
it
has
become
second
nature
to
them
and
nobody
bothers
much
about
do
people
know
asked
keefe
the
neighbors
i
oh
yes
but
as
i
say
it
makes
little
confusion
the
trouble
comes
as
miss
lane
suggested
when
wheeler
wants
to
go
to
boston
or
anywhere
in
yet
that
is
a
small
thing
compared
with
his
freedom
observed
keefe
i
think
he
got
off
but
with
wheeler
it
isn
t
so
much
the
deprivation
as
the
stigma
he
longs
for
a
full
pardon
and
would
do
most
anything
to
have
it
but
he
refuses
to
stand
for
sam
s
election
even
with
that
for
a
you
can
t
pardon
him
now
that
you
aren
t
governor
can
you
appleby
asked
genevieve
i
can
arrange
to
have
it
done
in
fact
the
present
governor
is
ready
and
even
anxious
to
pardon
him
but
i
hold
the
key
to
that
situation
myself
you
two
needn
t
know
all
the
details
but
now
you
know
the
principal
points
and
i
expect
you
to
utilize
i
m
willing
enough
and
genevieve
rocked
back
and
forth
thoughtfully
and
i
may
think
of
a
for
the
moment
i
don
get
chummy
with
maida
suggested
appleby
let
me
do
that
keefe
interrupted
without
undue
conceit
i
believe
i
can
influence
the
young
lady
and
i
think
miss
lane
now
that
she
knows
the
truth
can
jolly
up
wheeler
to
good
but
good
gracious
what
do
you
want
to
do
and
genevieve
giggled
say
i
entice
the
old
gentleman
over
the
his
pardon
is
canceled
and
he
s
a
you
agree
to
ignore
the
lapse
if
he
meets
your
that
the
idea
appleby
smiled
a
little
crude
miss
lane
and
beside
you
couldn
t
get
him
over
the
line
he
s
too
accustomed
to
his
limitations
to
be
caught
napping
and
not
even
your
charms
could
decoy
him
over
think
so
probably
you
re
right
well
suppose
i
try
to
work
through
maida
if
i
could
persuade
wheeler
that
she
suffers
from
the
stigma
of
her
father
s
incomplete
yes
that
s
it
this
thing
can
t
be
accomplished
by
brutal
threats
it
must
be
done
by
subtle
suggestion
and
convincing
that
s
my
idea
agreed
keefe
if
i
can
talk
straight
goods
to
miss
wheeler
and
make
her
see
how
much
better
it
would
be
for
her
father
in
his
latter
years
to
be
freed
from
all
touch
of
the
past
disgrace
she
might
coax
him
to
listen
to
that
s
right
now
you
know
what
you
re
here
for
just
do
what
you
don
t
make
a
mess
of
things
i
d
rather
you
did
nothing
than
to
do
some
fool
thing
trust
us
genevieve
encouraged
him
as
she
rose
me
and
curt
may
not
put
over
a
big
deal
but
we
won
t
do
anything
the
two
men
smiled
as
the
girl
with
a
pleasant
went
away
to
her
own
room
she
s
true
blue
said
keefe
yes
she
is
appleby
nodded
all
her
frivolity
is
on
the
surface
like
her
powder
and
paint
at
heart
that
child
has
only
my
interests
i
quite
appreciate
i
hope
you
think
the
same
of
me
i
do
keefe
more
i
trust
you
with
my
most
confidential
matters
i
ll
own
i
want
this
business
here
to
come
out
in
my
favor
i
can
t
push
wheeler
too
i
ask
your
help
but
as
i
hinted
i
ve
one
rod
yet
in
pickle
if
necessary
i
ll
use
it
but
i
d
rather
of
course
i
hope
you
won
t
have
to
but
i
ll
admit
i
don
t
see
much
chance
of
succeeding
with
the
present
morning
will
tell
if
we
can
t
work
the
thing
through
by
noon
ll
spring
my
last
trap
without
apparent
coercion
the
morning
hours
brought
about
a
cozy
session
on
the
south
veranda
with
miss
lane
and
daniel
wheeler
in
attendance
while
at
the
same
time
keefe
and
maida
wandered
over
the
beautiful
park
of
the
estate
keefe
had
gently
guided
the
conversation
into
confidential
channels
and
when
he
ventured
to
sympathize
with
the
girl
in
regard
to
her
father
s
deprivation
he
was
surprised
at
her
ready
acceptance
of
it
oh
you
know
don
t
you
keefe
she
exclaimed
but
you
don
t
know
all
it
means
to
me
you
see
blushed
but
went
steadily
you
see
i
m
engaged
a
man
i
adore
don
t
tell
me
if
you
d
rather
not
he
murmured
no
it
s
a
relief
to
seem
so
wise
and
go
on
the
kind
voice
helped
her
and
maida
resumed
well
allen
lives
in
boston
and
so
it
would
be
very
awkward
if
your
father
couldn
t
go
not
only
i
ve
made
a
vow
never
to
step
foot
into
massachusetts
until
my
father
can
do
so
too
nothing
would
induce
me
to
break
that
vow
not
even
your
lover
said
keefe
astonished
no
my
father
is
more
to
me
than
any
then
you
don
t
truly
love
oh
yes
i
do
but
father
is
my
idol
i
don
t
believe
any
girl
ever
adored
her
father
as
i
do
all
my
life
i
ve
had
only
the
one
make
him
far
as
possible
his
trouble
now
if
i
were
to
marry
and
leave
i
simply
couldn
t
do
it
can
t
allen
live
in
connecticut
no
his
business
interests
are
all
in
boston
and
he
can
t
be
transplanted
oh
if
father
could
only
do
what
appleby
wants
him
to
then
we
could
all
be
can
t
you
persuade
him
i
ve
tried
my
best
mother
has
tried
too
but
you
see
it
s
a
matter
of
principle
and
when
principle
is
involved
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
mother
and
i
would
scorn
any
wrongdoing
quite
as
much
as
father
and
you
ll
give
up
your
life
happiness
for
a
principle
of
course
wouldn
t
you
wouldn
t
every
decent
person
i
couldn
t
live
at
all
if
i
were
knowingly
doing
but
keefe
stopped
abruptly
i
know
what
you
were
going
to
say
maida
spoke
sadly
you
were
going
to
say
my
father
did
wrong
don
t
believe
he
don
t
you
know
i
know
in
my
own
heart
i
know
he
is
incapable
of
the
crime
he
was
charged
with
i
m
sure
he
is
shielding
some
one
else
or
else
some
one
did
it
of
whom
he
has
no
knowledge
but
my
father
commit
a
crime
never
do
you
care
to
tell
me
the
details
i
don
t
know
why
i
shouldn
t
it
was
long
ago
you
know
and
dad
was
accused
of
forgery
it
was
proved
on
the
jury
thought
it
he
was
and
sentenced
yes
to
a
long
prison
term
but
governor
appleby
pardoned
him
with
that
mean
old
proviso
that
he
never
should
step
into
massachusetts
was
your
mother
then
the
heir
to
the
massachusetts
property
no
but
appleby
knew
she
would
be
so
when
she
did
inherit
and
had
to
live
in
massachusetts
to
hold
the
estate
appleby
thought
he
had
dad
where
he
wanted
were
they
foes
politically
yes
because
dad
did
all
he
could
to
keep
appleby
from
being
but
didn
t
succeed
no
but
almost
so
then
appleby
did
this
pardon
trick
to
get
even
with
father
and
i
think
it
turned
out
more
serious
than
he
anticipated
for
mother
took
up
the
feud
and
she
got
lawyers
and
all
that
and
arranged
to
have
the
house
built
on
the
line
between
the
states
was
the
estate
she
inherited
on
both
sides
of
the
line
oh
no
but
it
was
near
the
southern
border
of
massachusetts
and
she
bought
enough
adjoining
land
to
make
the
arrangement
then
the
house
isn
t
on
the
ground
she
inherited
not
quite
but
the
lawyers
decided
it
so
that
she
really
complies
with
the
terms
of
the
will
so
it
s
all
was
your
mother
the
only
heir
so
far
as
we
can
find
out
i
believe
there
was
another
branch
of
the
family
but
we
haven
t
been
able
to
trace
it
so
as
the
years
go
by
we
feel
more
and
more
confident
there
s
no
other
heir
of
course
should
one
turn
up
his
claim
would
be
further
talk
quickly
convinced
keefe
that
there
was
no
hope
of
persuading
maida
wheeler
to
influence
or
advise
her
father
in
any
direction
other
than
his
idea
of
right
no
amount
of
urging
or
arguing
would
make
wheeler
see
his
duty
other
than
he
now
saw
it
or
make
maida
endeavor
to
change
his
views
with
a
sigh
over
his
failure
keefe
deftly
turned
the
talk
in
other
channels
and
then
they
strolled
back
to
the
house
as
was
to
be
expected
genevieve
had
made
no
progress
with
her
part
of
the
plan
her
talk
with
wheeler
had
availed
nothing
he
was
courteous
and
kind
he
was
amused
at
her
gay
merry
little
ways
he
politely
answered
her
questions
both
serious
and
flippant
but
absolutely
nothing
came
of
it
all
samuel
appleby
had
a
short
but
straightforward
conversation
with
wheeler
now
sara
he
said
remember
i
m
your
old
friend
as
well
as
your
i
don
t
call
you
a
relative
she
returned
calmly
a
family
connection
then
i
don
t
care
what
you
call
it
and
i
m
going
to
speak
right
out
for
i
know
better
than
to
try
sophistries
if
you
can
get
dan
to
play
my
game
regarding
my
son
s
campaign
i
ll
see
that
dan
gets
full
pardon
and
at
once
then
maida
can
marry
young
allen
and
you
can
all
go
to
boston
to
sam
appleby
i
d
rather
never
see
boston
again
never
have
dan
see
it
than
to
have
him
agree
to
endorse
principles
that
he
does
not
believe
and
dan
feels
the
same
way
about
but
don
t
you
consider
your
daughter
will
you
condemn
maida
to
a
maida
must
decide
for
herself
i
think
jeffrey
allen
will
yet
persuade
her
to
leave
her
father
she
is
devoted
to
dan
but
she
is
deeply
in
love
with
jeff
and
it
s
only
natural
she
should
go
with
him
any
other
girl
would
do
so
without
a
second
thought
maida
is
unusual
but
i
doubt
if
she
can
hold
out
much
longer
against
her
lover
s
i
think
she
will
maida
has
your
own
unbreakable
so
be
it
then
the
child
must
choose
for
herself
but
it
doesn
t
alter
the
stand
dan
and
i
have
nothing
can
alter
that
nothing
samuel
that
remains
to
be
seen
have
i
your
permission
to
talk
to
maida
alone
certainly
why
not
if
you
can
persuade
her
to
marry
jeff
i
ll
be
only
too
glad
if
you
find
her
determined
to
stand
by
her
father
then
the
case
remains
as
it
is
at
and
so
as
maida
returned
from
her
walk
with
keefe
she
was
asked
to
go
for
another
stroll
with
samuel
appleby
she
assented
though
with
no
show
of
pleasure
at
the
prospect
but
as
they
started
off
she
said
i
m
glad
to
have
a
talk
with
you
appleby
i
want
to
appeal
to
your
better
good
that
s
just
what
i
appeal
to
yours
suppose
you
word
your
appeal
mine
is
simple
to
understand
it
is
only
that
having
had
your
way
and
having
spoiled
my
father
s
life
for
fifteen
years
i
ask
you
in
the
name
of
humanity
and
justice
to
arrange
matters
so
that
his
latter
years
of
life
shall
be
free
from
the
curse
you
put
upon
i
didn
t
put
it
upon
brought
it
on
he
never
committed
that
you
know
it
what
do
you
mean
by
that
appleby
gave
her
a
startled
glance
had
maida
seen
this
glance
she
might
have
been
enlightened
but
her
eyes
were
cast
down
and
she
went
on
i
don
t
know
it
surely
but
i
am
positive
in
my
own
heart
father
never
did
it
however
that
s
past
history
all
i
ask
now
is
his
full
i
know
you
can
bring
about
if
you
want
and
i
will
willingly
and
gladly
if
your
father
will
grant
my
to
put
your
son
in
as
governor
with
the
same
political
views
that
prevented
my
father
from
voting
for
you
you
know
he
can
t
do
that
and
yet
you
expect
me
to
favor
him
but
don
t
you
see
the
difference
your
pardon
will
mean
everything
to
and
to
you
yes
but
that
s
a
secondary
consideration
i
d
ask
this
for
father
just
the
same
if
it
meant
disaster
for
me
i
believe
you
would
and
appleby
gazed
admiringly
at
the
sweet
forceful
face
and
the
earnest
eyes
of
course
i
should
as
i
say
it
means
life
s
happiness
to
and
his
consent
means
just
as
much
to
no
it
doesn
t
that
s
just
it
even
though
father
doesn
t
definitely
help
you
in
your
son
s
election
he
will
do
nothing
to
hinder
and
that
s
much
the
it
s
far
from
being
the
same
his
positive
and
definite
help
is
a
very
different
matter
from
his
negative
lack
of
interference
it
s
the
help
i
want
and
i
do
want
it
do
you
suppose
i
d
come
here
and
urge
for
i
didn
t
think
it
absolutely
necessary
no
i
suppose
not
but
i
know
he
never
will
grant
it
so
you
may
as
well
give
up
you
know
that
do
you
maida
appleby
s
voice
was
almost
wistful
i
most
certainly
do
and
the
girl
nodded
her
head
positively
then
listen
to
me
i
have
one
argument
yet
unused
i
m
going
to
use
it
now
and
with
maida
looked
up
in
alarm
appleby
s
face
was
stern
his
tone
betokened
a
final
even
desperate
decision
oh
not
with
me
she
cried
m
only
a
don
t
know
about
these
s
go
where
father
no
you
are
the
one
in
your
hands
must
rest
your
father
s
father
s
future
sit
here
beneath
the
old
know
about
the
tree
yes
of
never
mind
that
now
i
ve
only
a
few
moments
but
that
s
time
enough
you
know
maida
how
your
mother
holds
this
estate
must
live
in
massachusetts
well
we
do
the
lawyers
that
isn
t
the
point
this
is
it
there
is
another
we
ve
always
thought
it
maida
spoke
coolly
though
a
dull
fear
clutched
her
heart
it
s
more
than
a
possibility
it
s
a
fact
i
know
i
know
the
who
is
it
never
mind
for
the
moment
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
doesn
t
know
it
no
one
knows
it
but
me
now
you
and
i
know
no
one
else
does
do
you
understand
his
keen
gaze
at
her
made
her
understand
she
faltered
you
do
understand
he
asserted
you
sense
my
proposition
before
i
make
it
and
you
have
it
re
a
smart
girl
maida
yes
i
suggest
that
you
and
i
keep
our
secret
and
that
in
return
for
my
silence
you
persuade
your
father
to
meet
my
wishes
then
he
shall
be
fully
pardoned
and
all
will
be
you
criminal
you
dishonest
and
dishonorable
man
she
cried
her
eyes
blazing
her
cheeks
reddening
with
her
righteous
indignation
there
there
my
girl
have
a
care
you
haven
t
thought
it
all
out
yet
doubtless
you
re
going
to
say
that
neither
your
father
nor
mother
want
to
remain
here
if
my
statement
is
of
course
i
say
that
they
won
t
want
to
stay
a
minute
who
is
the
heir
tell
me
and
have
you
thought
what
it
will
mean
to
them
to
leave
this
place
have
you
realized
that
your
father
has
no
business
interests
nor
can
he
find
any
at
his
age
do
you
remember
that
your
mother
has
no
funds
outside
the
estate
she
inherited
do
you
want
to
plunge
them
into
penury
into
pauperism
in
their
declining
years
honesty
requires
but
the
sweet
voice
trembled
at
the
thought
honesty
is
a
good
fine
you
are
a
devoted
daughter
and
i
remind
you
that
to
tell
this
thing
i
have
told
you
means
for
you
and
your
parents
young
allen
can
t
support
are
unaccustomed
to
he
lowered
his
voice
this
heir
i
speak
of
has
no
knowledge
of
the
truth
he
misses
nothing
since
he
hopes
for
maida
looked
at
him
helplessly
i
must
think
she
said
brokenly
oh
you
are
cruel
to
put
this
responsibility
on
you
know
why
i
do
it
i
am
not
chapter
iv
the
big
sycamore
tree
at
the
south
door
the
appleby
car
stood
waiting
genevieve
was
saying
to
maida
with
the
affection
of
an
old
friend
we
re
coming
back
you
know
she
reminded
in
two
or
three
days
and
please
say
you
ll
be
glad
to
see
me
of
course
maida
assented
but
her
lip
trembled
and
her
eyes
showed
signs
of
ready
tears
cheer
up
genevieve
babbled
on
i
m
your
comes
with
time
so
am
i
put
in
curtis
keefe
for
a
few
days
miss
how
maida
did
it
she
scarcely
knew
herself
but
she
forced
a
smile
and
even
when
samuel
appleby
gave
her
a
warning
glance
at
parting
she
bravely
responded
to
his
farewell
words
and
even
gaily
waved
her
hand
as
the
car
rolled
down
the
drive
once
out
of
earshot
appleby
broke
out
i
played
my
trump
card
no
you
needn
t
ask
me
what
i
was
for
i
don
t
propose
to
tell
you
but
it
will
take
the
trick
i
m
sure
why
it
s
got
to
it
must
be
something
pretty
forcible
then
said
keefe
for
it
looked
to
me
about
as
likely
as
snow
in
summertime
that
any
of
those
rigid
puritans
would
ever
give
in
an
inch
to
your
or
mine
added
genevieve
never
before
have
i
failed
so
utterly
to
make
any
headway
when
i
set
out
to
be
really
you
did
your
best
miss
lane
and
appleby
looked
at
her
with
the
air
of
one
appraising
the
efficiency
of
a
salesman
i
confess
i
didn
t
think
wheeler
would
be
quite
such
a
all
these
he
s
just
like
concrete
keefe
observed
they
all
are
i
didn
t
know
there
were
such
conscientious
people
left
in
this
wicked
old
world
they
re
not
really
in
the
world
appleby
declared
they
ve
merely
vegetated
in
that
house
of
theirs
never
going
oh
come
now
appleby
and
genevieve
shook
her
head
boston
isn
t
the
only
burg
on
the
planet
they
often
go
to
new
york
and
that
s
going
some
not
really
asked
wheeler
he
hasn
t
been
for
five
or
six
years
and
though
maida
goes
occasionally
to
visit
friends
she
soon
runs
back
home
to
her
it
doesn
t
matter
keefe
said
they
re
by
no
means
mossbacks
or
hayseeds
they
re
right
there
with
the
goods
when
it
comes
to
modern
literature
or
oh
yes
they
re
a
highbrow
bunch
appleby
spoke
impatiently
but
a
recluse
like
that
is
no
sort
of
a
man
the
truth
is
i
m
at
the
end
of
my
patience
i
ve
got
to
put
this
thing
over
with
less
palaver
and
circumlocution
i
thought
i
d
give
him
a
put
the
thing
up
to
him
squarely
as
he
doesn
t
see
fit
to
meet
me
he
s
got
to
be
the
loser
that
s
he
seems
to
be
the
loser
as
it
this
from
keefe
but
nothing
to
what
s
coming
to
him
why
the
idea
of
my
sparing
him
at
all
is
ridiculous
if
he
doesn
t
come
down
he
s
got
to
be
wiped
out
that
s
what
it
amounts
to
wiped
figuratively
and
literally
mentally
morally
and
physically
that
s
how
i
ve
stood
all
i
ve
waited
long
now
i
m
going
to
play
the
game
my
own
way
as
i
said
i
played
a
trump
raised
one
pretty
definite
ruction
just
before
we
left
now
that
may
do
the
it
may
not
if
not
then
desperate
measures
are
will
be
used
good
gracious
appleby
genevieve
piped
up
from
her
fur
collar
which
nearly
muffled
her
little
face
you
sound
positively
murderous
murder
pooh
i
d
kill
dan
wheeler
in
a
minute
if
that
would
help
sam
but
i
don
t
want
wheeler
want
him
want
his
when
he
sits
there
looking
like
a
stone
wall
and
about
as
easy
to
overthrow
i
declare
i
kill
him
but
i
don
t
intend
to
it
s
far
more
likely
he
d
kill
me
why
exclaimed
keefe
why
should
he
you
re
not
at
all
wheeler
isn
t
of
the
murderer
type
or
i
d
be
taking
my
life
in
my
hands
to
go
into
his
house
he
hates
me
with
all
the
strength
of
a
hard
bigoted
but
strictly
just
nature
he
thinks
i
was
unjust
in
the
matter
of
his
pardon
he
thinks
i
was
contemptible
and
false
to
our
friendship
and
he
would
be
honestly
and
truly
glad
if
i
were
dead
s
no
murderer
of
course
not
cried
genevieve
how
you
do
talk
as
if
murder
were
an
everyday
performance
why
people
in
our
class
don
t
kill
each
other
the
placid
assumption
of
equality
of
class
with
her
employer
was
so
consistently
miss
lane
s
usual
attitude
that
it
caused
no
mental
comment
from
either
of
her
hearers
her
services
were
so
valuable
that
any
such
little
idiosyncrasy
was
tolerated
of
course
we
don
agreed
appleby
but
i
d
wager
a
good
bit
that
if
dan
wheeler
could
bump
me
off
without
his
conscience
knowing
i
d
go
i
don
t
know
about
that
said
genevieve
but
i
do
believe
that
girl
would
do
it
what
cried
keefe
maida
yes
she
s
a
lamb
for
looks
but
she
s
got
a
lion
s
anybody
ever
had
one
talk
about
a
tigress
protecting
her
cubs
it
would
be
a
performance
beside
maida
wheeler
shielding
her
fighting
for
or
killing
somebody
for
him
rubbish
laughed
appleby
maida
might
be
willing
enough
in
that
lion
heart
of
little
girls
don
t
go
around
killing
i
know
it
and
i
don
t
expect
her
to
but
i
only
say
she
s
capable
of
goethe
keefe
spoke
in
his
superior
way
we
are
all
capable
of
crime
even
the
best
of
i
remember
that
phrase
mused
appleby
is
it
goethe
s
well
i
don
t
say
it
s
literally
true
for
lots
of
people
are
too
much
of
a
jellyfish
makeup
to
have
such
a
capability
but
i
do
believe
there
are
lots
of
strong
forcible
people
who
are
absolutely
capable
of
the
opportunity
that
s
it
and
genevieve
nodded
her
head
wisely
opportunity
is
what
counts
i
ve
read
detective
stories
and
they
prove
it
be
careful
appleby
how
you
trust
yourself
alone
with
that
will
do
he
reprimanded
i
can
take
care
of
myself
miss
genevieve
always
knew
when
she
had
gone
too
far
and
instead
of
sulking
she
tactfully
changed
the
subject
and
entertained
the
others
with
her
amusing
chatter
at
which
she
was
a
success
at
that
very
moment
maida
wheeler
alone
in
her
room
was
sobbing
wildly
yet
using
every
precaution
that
she
shouldn
t
be
heard
thrown
across
her
bed
her
face
buried
in
the
pillows
she
fairly
shook
with
the
intensity
of
her
grief
but
as
often
happens
after
she
had
brought
her
crying
spell
to
a
exhausted
nature
insists
on
a
rose
and
bathed
her
flushed
face
and
sat
down
to
think
it
out
calmly
yet
the
more
she
thought
the
less
calm
she
grew
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
face
to
face
with
a
great
question
which
she
could
not
refer
to
her
parents
always
she
had
confided
in
them
and
matters
that
seemed
great
to
her
even
though
trifling
in
themselves
were
invariably
settled
and
straightened
out
by
her
wise
and
loving
father
or
mother
but
now
samuel
appleby
had
told
her
a
dreadful
she
must
not
only
weigh
and
decide
about
but
least
until
she
from
her
parents
for
maida
thought
if
i
tell
them
they
ll
at
once
insist
on
knowing
who
the
rightful
heir
is
they
ll
give
over
the
place
to
what
will
become
of
us
her
conscience
was
as
active
as
ever
it
was
her
sense
of
right
and
wrong
was
in
no
way
warped
or
blunted
but
instinct
told
her
that
she
must
keep
this
matter
entirely
to
herself
until
she
had
come
to
her
own
conclusion
moreover
she
realized
the
conclusion
must
be
her
decision
must
be
arrived
at
by
herself
and
unaided
finally
accepting
all
this
she
resolved
to
put
the
whole
thing
out
of
her
mind
for
the
moment
her
parents
were
so
intimately
acquainted
with
her
every
mood
or
shade
of
demeanor
they
would
see
at
once
that
something
was
troubling
her
mind
unless
she
used
the
utmost
care
to
prevent
it
care
too
not
to
overdo
her
precaution
it
would
be
quite
as
evident
that
she
was
concealing
something
if
she
were
unusually
gay
or
carefree
of
manner
so
the
poor
child
went
downstairs
determined
to
forget
utterly
the
news
she
had
heard
until
such
time
as
she
could
be
again
by
herself
and
she
succeeded
though
haunted
by
a
vague
sense
of
being
deceitful
she
behaved
so
entirely
as
usual
that
neither
of
her
parents
suspected
her
of
pretense
moreover
the
subject
of
samuel
appleby
s
visit
was
such
a
fruitful
source
of
conversation
that
there
was
less
chance
of
minor
considerations
never
will
i
consent
her
father
was
reiterating
as
maida
entered
the
room
why
sara
i
d
rather
have
the
conditional
pardon
rescinded
rather
pay
full
penalty
of
my
conviction
than
stand
for
the
things
young
sam
s
campaign
must
stand
for
a
clenched
fist
came
down
on
the
table
by
way
of
emphasis
now
dad
said
maida
gaily
don
t
thump
around
like
that
you
look
as
if
you
d
like
to
thump
appleby
and
i
should
i
wish
i
could
bang
into
his
head
just
how
i
feel
about
oh
he
knows
and
wheeler
smiled
he
knows
perfectly
how
you
but
truly
mother
don
t
you
think
dad
not
do
anything
just
give
in
to
my
sake
is
our
only
your
father
and
i
would
not
budge
one
step
for
for
you
and
for
my
dear
little
girl
that
s
what
makes
it
so
for
us
can
t
our
maida
broke
down
it
wasn
t
for
her
sake
she
was
for
the
sake
of
her
lover
it
was
for
the
sake
of
her
they
might
remain
in
yet
comfort
at
the
expense
of
honesty
oh
the
problem
was
too
hadn
t
worked
it
out
yet
i
can
t
think
her
father
s
grave
voice
broke
in
on
her
tumultuous
thoughts
i
can
t
believe
maida
that
you
would
want
my
freedom
at
the
cost
of
my
seared
no
oh
no
father
i
don
know
i
don
t
but
what
is
this
dreadful
thing
you
d
have
to
countenance
if
you
linked
up
on
the
appleby
side
are
they
rascals
not
from
their
own
point
of
view
and
dan
wheeler
smiled
they
think
we
are
you
can
t
understand
politics
child
but
you
must
know
that
a
man
who
is
heart
and
soul
in
sympathy
with
the
principles
of
his
party
can
t
conscientiously
cross
over
and
work
for
the
other
yes
i
know
that
and
i
know
that
tells
the
whole
story
but
father
think
what
there
is
at
stake
your
i
know
that
maida
dear
and
you
can
never
know
how
my
very
soul
is
torn
as
i
try
to
persuade
myself
that
for
those
reasons
it
would
be
right
for
me
to
consent
he
passed
his
hand
wearily
across
his
brow
and
then
folding
his
arms
on
the
table
he
let
his
head
sink
down
upon
them
maida
flew
to
his
side
father
dearest
she
crooned
over
him
as
she
caressed
his
bowed
head
don
t
think
of
it
for
a
minute
you
know
i
d
give
up
d
give
up
it
means
one
speck
of
good
for
i
know
it
dear
child
away
now
maida
leave
me
to
understanding
both
maida
and
her
mother
quietly
left
the
room
i
m
sorry
girlie
dear
that
you
have
to
be
involved
in
these
scenes
wheeler
said
fondly
as
the
two
went
to
the
don
t
talk
that
way
mother
i
m
part
of
the
family
and
i
m
old
enough
to
have
a
share
and
a
voice
in
all
these
matters
but
just
think
what
it
would
mean
if
father
had
his
pardon
look
at
this
room
and
think
he
has
never
been
in
it
never
has
seen
the
view
from
the
window
the
general
coziness
of
it
i
know
dear
but
that
s
an
old
story
your
father
is
accustomed
to
living
only
in
his
own
and
not
to
be
able
to
go
to
the
other
end
of
the
or
if
he
chooses
it
s
outrageous
yes
maida
i
quite
no
more
outrageous
than
it
was
last
last
yes
it
is
it
grows
more
outrageous
every
minute
mother
what
did
that
old
will
say
that
you
must
live
in
massachusetts
know
that
of
course
i
do
and
if
you
lived
elsewhere
what
then
i
forfeit
the
and
what
would
become
of
it
in
default
of
any
other
heirs
it
would
go
to
the
state
of
and
there
are
no
other
heirs
what
ails
you
maida
you
know
all
this
no
there
are
no
other
you
re
sure
as
sure
as
we
can
be
your
father
had
every
possible
search
made
there
were
advertisements
kept
in
the
papers
for
years
and
able
lawyers
did
all
they
could
to
find
heirs
if
there
were
any
and
finding
none
we
were
advised
that
there
were
none
and
we
could
rest
in
undisturbed
suppose
one
should
appear
what
then
then
little
girl
we
d
give
him
the
keys
of
the
house
and
walk
where
would
we
walk
to
i
ve
no
idea
in
fact
i
can
t
imagine
where
we
could
walk
to
but
that
thank
heaven
is
not
one
of
our
troubles
your
father
would
indeed
be
desperately
fixed
if
it
were
you
know
maida
from
a
fine
capable
business
man
he
became
a
wreck
because
of
that
unjust
father
committed
the
forgery
of
course
not
who
did
we
don
t
know
it
was
cleverly
done
and
the
crime
was
purposely
fastened
on
your
father
because
he
was
about
to
be
made
the
rival
candidate
of
appleby
for
i
know
and
appleby
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
your
father
doesn
t
admit
he
must
have
hush
maida
these
matters
are
not
for
you
to
judge
you
know
your
father
has
done
all
he
honestly
could
to
be
fully
pardoned
or
to
discover
the
real
criminal
and
as
he
hasn
t
succeeded
you
must
rest
content
with
the
knowledge
that
there
was
no
stone
left
but
mother
suppose
appleby
has
something
more
up
his
sleeve
suppose
he
comes
down
on
dad
with
some
unexpected
some
unforeseen
blow
maida
be
quiet
don
t
make
me
sorry
that
we
have
let
you
into
our
confidence
as
far
as
we
have
these
are
matters
above
your
head
should
such
a
thing
as
you
hint
occur
your
father
can
deal
with
but
i
want
to
and
you
can
best
do
that
by
not
trying
to
help
your
part
is
to
divert
your
father
to
love
him
and
cheer
him
and
entertain
him
you
know
this
and
you
know
for
you
to
undertake
to
advise
or
suggest
is
not
only
ridiculous
but
all
right
mother
i
ll
be
good
i
don
t
mean
to
be
you
are
when
you
assume
ability
you
don
t
wheeler
s
loving
smile
robbed
the
words
of
any
harsh
effect
run
along
now
and
see
if
dad
won
t
go
for
a
walk
with
you
and
don
t
refer
to
anything
maida
went
and
found
wheeler
quite
ready
for
a
stroll
which
way
he
asked
as
they
crossed
the
south
veranda
round
the
park
and
bring
up
under
the
tree
and
have
tea
there
dictated
maida
her
heart
already
lighter
as
she
obeyed
her
mother
s
dictum
to
avoid
unpleasant
subjects
but
as
they
walked
on
and
trivial
talk
seemed
to
pall
they
naturally
reverted
to
the
discussion
of
their
recent
guests
mr
appleby
is
an
old
curmudgeon
maida
declared
mr
keefe
is
nice
and
but
the
little
lane
girl
is
a
scream
i
never
saw
any
one
so
funny
now
she
was
quite
a
grand
lady
and
then
she
was
a
common
little
piece
but
underneath
it
all
she
showed
a
lot
of
good
sense
and
i
m
sure
in
her
work
she
has
real
appleby
wouldn
t
keep
her
if
she
didn
t
have
her
father
rejoined
but
why
do
you
call
him
a
curmudgeon
he
s
very
oh
yes
he
is
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
m
not
sure
just
what
a
curmudgeon
is
s
it
i
gather
you
don
t
especially
admire
my
old
friend
if
he
s
a
me
enemies
fie
fie
maida
what
do
you
mean
remember
he
gave
me
my
yes
a
high
old
pardon
say
dad
tell
me
again
exactly
how
he
worded
that
letter
about
the
i
ve
told
you
a
dozen
times
he
didn
t
mean
anything
anyhow
he
only
said
that
when
the
big
sycamore
tree
went
into
massachusetts
i
could
what
a
crazy
thing
to
say
wasn
t
it
it
was
because
we
had
been
talking
about
the
play
of
you
remember
till
birnam
wood
shall
come
to
oh
yes
and
then
it
did
a
yes
the
men
came
carrying
branches
we
d
been
talking
about
it
discussing
some
point
and
seemed
clever
i
appleby
and
he
wrote
that
about
the
meaning
but
birnam
wood
did
only
by
a
trick
and
that
would
not
work
in
this
case
why
are
you
thinking
of
carrying
a
branch
of
sycamore
into
massachusetts
maida
returned
his
smile
as
she
answered
i
d
manage
to
carry
the
whole
tree
in
if
it
would
do
any
good
but
i
s
pose
old
puritan
father
you
re
too
conscientious
to
take
advantage
of
a
trick
can
t
say
till
i
know
the
details
of
the
game
but
i
doubt
appleby
s
being
unable
to
see
through
your
trick
and
are
you
that
wouldn
t
matter
trick
or
no
trick
if
the
big
sycamore
went
into
massachusetts
you
could
go
but
i
don
t
see
any
good
plan
for
getting
it
in
and
too

wouldn
t
be
sycamore
ridge
without
it
don
t
you
love
the
old
tree
dad
of
course
as
i
love
every
stick
and
stone
about
the
place
it
has
been
a
real
haven
to
me
in
my
perturbed
suppose
you
had
to
leave
it
daddy
i
think
i
d
die
dear
unless
that
is
we
could
go
back
isn
t
this
home
it
s
the
dearest
spot
on
my
native
there
there
dad
don
t
let
s
talk
about
it
we
re
here
for
heaven
send
we
are
dearest
i
couldn
t
face
the
loss
of
this
place
what
made
you
think
of
such
a
thing
oh
i
m
thinking
of
all
sorts
of
things
but
father
while
we
re
talking
of
t
couldn
t
you
bring
yourself
somehow
to
do
what
appleby
wants
you
to
do
i
don
t
know
much
about
father
darling
if
you
maida
my
little
girl
don
t
think
i
haven
t
tried
don
t
think
i
don
t
realize
what
it
means
to
you
and
jeff
i
i
know
how
it
would
simplify
matters
if
i
should
go
over
to
the
appleby
push
sam
s
i
could
do
it
i
know
that
it
would
mean
my
full
pardon
my
return
to
my
old
home
my
reunion
with
old
scenes
and
associations
and
more
than
that
it
would
mean
the
happiness
of
my
only
her
chosen
husband
and
yet
maida
as
god
is
my
judge
i
am
honest
in
my
assertion
that
i
so
betray
my
honor
and
spend
my
remaining
years
a
living
lie
i
can
t
do
it
and
the
calm
sorrowful
countenance
he
turned
to
the
girl
was
more
positive
and
final
than
any
further
protestation
could
have
been
chapter
v
the
bugle
sounded
taps
although
the
portions
of
the
house
and
grounds
that
were
used
by
wheeler
included
the
most
attractive
spots
yet
there
were
many
forbidden
places
that
were
a
real
temptation
to
him
an
especial
one
was
the
arbor
that
had
so
charmed
genevieve
and
another
was
the
broad
and
beautiful
north
veranda
to
be
sure
the
south
piazza
was
equally
attractive
but
it
was
galling
to
be
compelled
to
avoid
any
part
of
his
own
domain
however
the
passing
years
had
made
the
conditions
a
matter
of
habit
and
it
was
only
occasionally
that
wheeler
s
annoyance
was
poignant
in
fact
he
and
his
wife
bore
the
cross
better
than
did
maida
she
had
never
become
reconciled
to
the
unjust
and
arbitrary
dictum
of
the
conditional
pardon
she
lived
in
a
constant
fear
lest
her
father
should
some
day
inadvertently
and
unintentionally
step
on
the
forbidden
ground
and
it
should
be
reported
indeed
knowing
her
father
s
quixotic
honesty
she
was
by
no
means
sure
he
wouldn
t
report
it
himself
it
had
never
never
would
occur
and
yet
she
often
imagined
some
sudden
emergency
such
as
a
fire
or
burglars
that
might
cause
his
impulsive
invasion
of
the
other
side
of
the
house
in
her
anxiety
she
had
spoken
of
this
to
samuel
appleby
when
he
was
there
but
he
gave
her
no
satisfaction
he
merely
replied
a
condition
is
a
curtis
keefe
had
tried
to
help
her
cause
by
saying
surely
a
case
of
danger
would
prove
an
exception
to
the
rule
but
appleby
had
only
shaken
his
head
in
denial
though
care
had
been
taken
to
have
the
larger
part
of
the
house
on
the
massachusetts
side
of
the
line
yet
the
rooms
most
used
by
the
family
were
in
connecticut
here
was
wheeler
s
den
and
this
had
come
to
be
the
most
used
room
in
the
whole
house
wheeler
s
which
her
husband
never
had
entered
was
also
attractive
but
both
mother
and
daughter
invaded
the
den
whenever
leisure
hours
were
to
be
enjoyed
the
den
contained
a
large
south
bay
window
which
was
maida
s
favorite
spot
it
had
a
broad
comfortable
and
here
she
spent
much
of
her
time
curled
up
among
the
cushions
reading
there
were
long
curtains
which
hid
her
from
view
and
often
she
was
there
for
hours
without
her
father
s
knowing
it
his
own
work
was
engrossing
cut
off
from
his
established
law
business
in
massachusetts
he
had
at
first
felt
unable
to
start
it
anew
in
different
surroundings
then
owing
to
his
wife
s
large
fortune
it
was
decided
that
he
should
give
up
all
business
for
a
time
and
as
the
time
went
on
and
there
was
no
real
necessity
for
an
added
income
wheeler
had
indulged
in
his
hobby
of
book
collecting
and
had
amassed
a
library
of
unique
charm
as
well
as
goodly
intrinsic
value
moreover
it
kept
him
interested
and
occupied
and
prevented
his
becoming
morose
or
melancholy
over
his
restricted
life
so
many
long
days
he
worked
away
at
his
books
and
maida
hidden
in
the
watched
him
lovingly
in
the
intervals
of
her
reading
sitting
there
the
morning
after
samuel
appleby
s
departure
she
read
not
at
all
although
a
book
lay
open
on
her
lap
she
was
trying
to
decide
a
big
matter
trying
to
solve
a
vexed
question
maida
s
was
a
straightforward
nature
she
never
deceived
herself
if
she
did
anything
against
her
better
judgment
even
against
her
conscience
it
was
with
open
eyes
and
understanding
mind
she
used
no
sophistry
no
pretence
and
if
she
acted
mistakenly
she
was
always
satisfied
to
abide
by
the
consequences
and
now
she
set
about
her
problem
systematically
and
methodically
determined
to
decide
upon
her
course
and
then
strictly
follow
it
she
glanced
at
her
father
absorbed
in
his
book
catalogues
and
indexes
and
a
great
wave
of
love
and
devotion
filled
her
heart
surely
no
sacrifice
was
too
great
that
would
bring
peace
or
pleasure
to
that
martyred
spirit
that
he
was
a
martyr
maida
was
as
sure
as
she
was
that
she
was
alive
she
knew
him
too
well
to
believe
for
an
instant
that
he
had
committed
a
criminal
act
it
was
an
impossibility
for
one
of
his
character
but
that
she
could
do
nothing
about
the
question
had
been
raised
and
settled
when
she
was
too
young
to
know
anything
about
it
and
now
her
simple
duty
was
to
do
anything
she
might
to
ease
his
burden
and
to
help
him
to
forget
and
she
said
to
herself
first
of
all
he
must
stay
in
this
home
he
positively
that
s
all
there
is
about
that
now
if
he
he
has
the
least
hint
that
there
is
another
heir
he
ll
get
out
at
at
least
he
ll
move
heaven
and
earth
to
find
the
heir
and
then
we
ll
have
to
move
and
where
to
that
s
an
unanswerable
question
anyway
i
ve
only
one
sure
conviction
i
ve
got
to
keep
from
him
all
knowledge
or
suspicion
of
that
other
heir
maybe
it
isn
t
appleby
made
it
i
don
t
think
so
at
any
rate
i
have
to
proceed
as
if
it
were
true
and
do
my
best
and
first
of
all
i
ve
got
to
hush
up
my
own
conscience
i
ve
too
much
of
my
father
s
nature
to
want
to
live
here
if
it
rightfully
belongs
to
somebody
else
i
feel
like
a
thief
already
but
i
m
going
to
bear
m
going
to
live
under
that
horrid
conviction
that
i
m
living
a
father
s
maida
was
in
earnest
by
nature
and
by
training
her
conscience
was
acutely
sensitive
to
the
finest
shades
of
right
and
wrong
she
actually
longed
to
announce
the
possibility
of
another
heir
and
let
justice
decide
the
case
but
her
filial
devotion
was
in
this
thing
greater
even
than
her
conscience
her
mother
too
she
knew
would
be
crushed
by
the
revelation
of
the
secret
but
would
insist
on
thorough
investigation
and
if
need
be
on
renunciation
of
the
dear
home
her
mental
struggle
went
on
at
times
it
seemed
as
if
she
couldn
t
live
beneath
the
weight
of
such
a
secret
then
she
knew
she
must
do
it
what
was
her
own
peace
of
mind
compared
with
her
father
s
what
was
her
own
freedom
of
conscience
compared
with
his
tranquillity
she
thought
of
telling
jeffrey
allen
but
she
argued
he
would
feel
as
the
others
as
she
herself
the
matter
must
be
dragged
out
into
the
open
and
settled
one
way
or
the
other
no
she
must
bear
the
brunt
of
the
thing
alone
she
must
never
tell
any
one
then
the
next
point
was
would
appleby
tell
he
hadn
t
said
so
but
she
felt
sure
he
would
well
she
must
do
all
she
could
to
prevent
that
he
was
to
return
in
a
day
or
two
by
that
time
she
must
work
out
some
plan
must
think
up
some
way
to
persuade
him
not
to
tell
what
the
argument
would
be
she
had
no
idea
but
she
was
determined
to
try
her
uttermost
there
was
one
maida
blushed
even
at
the
thought
sam
to
marry
wanted
to
for
a
year
or
more
many
times
she
had
refused
him
and
many
times
he
had
returned
for
another
attempt
at
persuasion
to
consent
to
this
would
enable
her
to
control
the
senior
appleby
s
revelations
it
would
indeed
be
a
last
wouldn
t
even
think
of
it
yet
surely
there
was
some
other
way
the
poor
tortured
child
was
roused
from
her
desperate
plannings
by
a
cheery
voice
calling
here
s
me
jeffrey
she
cried
springing
from
the
and
out
to
greet
him
dear
he
said
as
he
took
her
in
his
arms
dear
dearer
dearest
is
troubling
you
trouble
nothing
how
can
i
be
troubled
when
you
re
here
but
you
are
you
can
t
fool
me
you
know
never
mind
you
can
tell
me
later
i
ve
got
three
whole
s
that
splendid
how
did
it
happen
old
bennett
went
off
for
a
week
s
s
he
said
if
i
did
up
my
chores
nice
and
proper
i
could
take
a
little
vacation
myself
oh
you
peach
you
re
twice
as
beautifuller
as
ever
a
whirlwind
embrace
followed
this
speech
and
left
maida
breathless
and
laughing
while
her
father
smiled
benignly
upon
the
pair
it
was
some
hours
later
that
as
they
sat
under
the
big
sycamore
jeffrey
allen
begged
maida
to
tell
him
her
troubles
for
i
know
you
re
pretty
well
broken
up
over
something
he
declared
how
do
you
know
she
smiled
at
him
why
my
girl
i
know
every
shadow
that
crosses
your
dear
do
i
wear
my
heart
on
my
sleeve
then
you
don
t
have
to
for
me
to
see
it
i
recognize
the
signs
from
your
face
your
manner
your
whole
being
is
trembling
with
some
fear
or
some
grief
so
tell
me
all
about
and
maida
told
not
the
last
horrible
threat
that
samuel
appleby
had
told
her
alone
but
the
state
of
things
as
appleby
had
presented
it
to
daniel
wheeler
himself
and
so
you
see
jeff
it
s
a
deadlock
father
won
t
vote
for
young
don
t
mean
only
vote
but
throw
all
his
that
means
a
sam
s
side
and
if
he
doesn
t
appleby
won
t
get
him
know
we
hoped
he
would
this
yes
dear
it
would
mean
so
much
to
yes
and
to
dad
and
mother
too
well
there
s
no
hope
of
that
unless
father
throws
himself
heart
and
soul
into
the
appleby
and
he
won
t
do
that
of
course
not
he
couldn
t
jeff
he
d
have
to
subscribe
to
what
he
doesn
t
believe
subscribe
to
a
lie
and
you
know
yes
and
you
myself
none
of
us
would
want
him
to
do
that
maida
doesn
t
necessity
justify
a
fraud
jeff
the
question
was
put
so
wistfully
that
the
young
man
smiled
nixy
and
you
know
that
even
better
than
i
do
dear
why
maida
what
i
love
you
most
even
more
than
your
dear
sweet
beauty
of
face
is
the
marvellous
beauty
of
your
nature
your
character
your
flawless
soul
attracted
me
first
of
as
i
saw
it
shining
through
your
clear
honest
oh
jeffrey
and
maida
s
clear
eyes
filled
with
tears
i
m
not
honest
i
m
not
true
blue
then
nobody
on
this
green
earth
is
don
t
say
such
things
dear
i
know
what
you
mean
that
you
you
want
your
father
to
sacrifice
his
principles
in
part
at
least
to
gain
his
full
pardon
thereby
see
how
i
read
your
thoughts
but
you
don
t
really
think
that
you
only
think
you
think
it
if
the
thing
came
to
a
focus
you
d
be
the
first
one
to
forbid
the
slightest
deviation
from
the
line
of
strictest
truth
and
honor
oh
jeff
do
you
think
i
would
of
course
i
think
know
it
you
are
a
strange
maida
on
an
impulse
i
can
imagine
you
doing
something
something
pretty
with
even
a
little
time
for
thought
you
do
a
what
maida
was
truly
surprised
i
could
jump
into
any
sort
of
wickedness
i
didn
t
quite
put
it
that
way
jeff
laughed
you
know
it
s
my
theory
that
given
opportunity
anybody
can
yield
to
nonsense
it
s
a
poor
sort
of
honor
that
gives
out
at
a
critical
moment
not
at
all
most
people
can
resist
temptation
given
a
strong
enough
temptation
and
a
perfect
opportunity
and
your
staunchest
most
conscientious
spirit
is
going
to
i
don
t
believe
you
don
t
have
maybe
it
isn
t
always
true
but
it
often
is
howsomever
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
present
case
your
father
is
not
going
to
lose
his
though
you
might
do
so
smiled
at
i
can
t
see
you
getting
a
chance
you
re
not
in
on
the
deal
in
any
way
are
you
no
except
that
appleby
asked
me
to
use
all
my
influence
with
which
you
ve
done
yes
but
it
made
not
the
slightest
of
course
not
i
say
maid
young
sam
isn
t
coming
down
here
is
he
not
that
i
know
of
but
maida
couldn
t
help
her
rising
color
for
she
knew
what
allen
was
thinking
just
let
him
try
it
that
s
all
just
let
him
show
his
rubicund
countenance
in
these
he
wants
trouble
does
anybody
ever
trouble
maida
smiled
a
little
why
of
course
they
do
sometimes
they
want
it
so
much
that
they
borrow
it
i
m
not
doing
that
i
ve
had
it
offered
to
full
measure
heaped
up
pressed
down
and
running
poor
little
girl
don
t
take
it
so
hard
dearest
i
ll
have
a
talk
with
your
father
and
we
ll
see
how
matters
really
stand
i
doubt
it
s
as
bad
as
you
anyway
if
no
good
results
come
our
way
things
are
no
worse
than
they
have
been
for
years
your
father
has
lived
fairly
contented
and
happy
let
things
drift
and
in
another
year
or
two
after
the
election
is
a
thing
of
the
past
we
can
pick
up
the
pardon
question
again
by
that
time
you
and
i
will
will
we
be
maida
i
don
t
know
well
we
ll
be
together
anyway
you
ll
be
my
wife
and
if
we
can
t
live
in
can
live
out
of
boston
and
that
s
all
there
is
about
that
you
ll
have
to
come
here
to
live
there
s
enough
for
us
settle
down
here
and
sponge
on
your
mother
i
see
it
but
never
you
mind
lady
fair
something
will
happen
to
smooth
out
our
path
perhaps
this
old
tree
will
take
it
into
its
head
to
go
over
into
massachusetts
and
so
blaze
a
trail
for
your
oh
very
likely
but
i
ve
renewed
my
unless
father
can
go
into
the
state
never
will
all
right
sweetheart
renew
your
vow
whenever
its
time
limit
expires
i
m
going
to
fix
things
so
no
vows
will
be
our
marriage
vows
will
you
take
them
dear
when
the
time
comes
but
maida
did
not
smile
and
jeff
watching
her
closely
concluded
there
was
yet
some
point
on
which
she
had
not
enlightened
him
however
he
asked
no
further
question
but
bided
his
time
guess
i
ll
chop
down
the
old
tree
while
i
m
here
and
ship
it
into
massachusetts
as
firewood
he
suggested
fine
idea
maida
acquiesced
but
you
d
only
have
your
trouble
for
your
pains
you
see
the
stipulation
was
without
the
intervention
of
human
all
right
we
ll
chop
it
down
by
machinery
i
wish
the
tree
promise
meant
anything
but
it
doesn
t
it
was
only
made
as
a
proof
positive
how
impossible
was
any
chance
of
but
now
a
chance
of
pardon
has
yes
but
a
chance
that
can
not
be
taken
you
ll
be
here
jeff
when
they
come
back
then
you
can
talk
with
appleby
and
maybe
as
man
to
man
you
can
convince
convince
nothing
don
t
you
suppose
i
ve
tried
every
argument
i
know
of
with
that
old
dunderhead
i
ve
spent
hours
with
him
discussing
your
father
s
case
i
ve
talked
myself
deaf
dumb
and
blind
with
no
scrap
of
success
but
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
maida
that
i
might
have
moved
the
old
duffer
to
leniency
if
it
hadn
t
been
me
yes
you
know
well
enough
young
sam
s
attitude
toward
you
and
old
appleby
as
good
as
said
if
i
d
give
up
my
claim
on
your
favor
and
give
sonny
sam
a
chance
there
d
be
hope
for
your
h
m
indeed
you
don
t
say
so
and
you
replied
i
didn
t
reply
much
of
anything
for
if
i
d
said
what
i
wanted
to
say
he
would
have
been
quite
justified
in
thinking
that
i
was
no
fit
mate
for
a
christian
girl
let
s
don
t
talk
about
that
night
maida
went
to
her
room
leaving
allen
to
have
a
long
serious
talk
with
her
father
she
hoped
much
from
the
confab
for
jeff
allen
was
a
man
of
ideas
and
of
good
sound
judgment
he
could
see
straight
and
could
advise
sensibly
and
well
and
maida
hoped
too
that
something
would
happen
or
some
way
be
devised
that
the
secret
told
her
by
appleby
might
be
of
no
moment
perhaps
there
was
no
heir
save
in
the
old
man
s
imagination
or
perhaps
it
was
only
someone
who
would
inherit
a
portion
of
the
property
leaving
enough
for
their
own
support
and
comfort
at
any
rate
she
went
to
bed
comforted
and
cheered
by
the
knowledge
that
jeff
was
there
and
that
if
there
was
anything
to
be
done
he
would
do
it
she
had
vague
misgivings
because
she
had
not
told
him
what
appleby
had
threatened
but
she
argued
if
she
decided
to
suppress
that
bit
of
news
she
must
not
breathe
it
to
even
jeff
so
encouraged
at
the
outlook
and
exhausted
by
her
day
of
worriment
she
slept
soundly
till
well
into
the
night
then
she
was
awakened
by
a
strange
sound
it
gave
her
at
first
a
strange
impression
of
being
on
an
ocean
steamer
she
couldn
t
think
why
for
her
senses
responded
only
to
the
vague
sense
of
familiarity
with
such
a
sound
but
wide
awake
in
a
moment
she
heard
more
of
it
and
realized
that
it
was
a
bugle
to
which
she
clear
though
not
loud
notes
of
a
bugle
amazed
she
jumped
from
her
bed
and
looked
out
of
a
window
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
she
saw
nothing
and
heard
the
last
faint
notes
die
away
as
she
listened
there
was
no
further
sound
and
she
returned
to
bed
and
after
a
time
fell
asleep
again
she
pondered
over
the
occurrence
while
dressing
next
morning
wondering
what
it
meant
downstairs
she
found
only
jeffrey
in
the
hear
anything
funny
in
the
night
maida
he
asked
her
yes
a
bugle
she
returned
did
you
hear
it
of
course
i
did
who
plays
the
thing
around
here
no
one
that
i
know
of
wasn
t
it
rather
strange
i
should
say
so
made
me
think
of
the
old
english
castles
where
spooks
walk
the
parapets
and
play
on
bugles
or
bagpipes
or
some
such
oh
those
silly
stories
but
this
was
a
real
bugle
played
by
a
real
how
do
you
know
by
the
spook
bugles
sound
just
the
how
do
know
how
could
they
be
heard
if
they
didn
t
here
s
your
father
wheeler
who
s
your
musical
neighbor
but
daniel
wheeler
did
not
smile
go
up
to
your
mother
maida
dear
he
said
isn
t
well
cheer
her
up
all
you
what
s
the
trouble
allen
asked
solicitously
as
maida
ran
from
the
room
a
strange
thing
my
boy
did
you
hear
a
bugle
call
last
night
yes
sir
it
sounded
is
there
a
camp
near
by
no
nothing
of
the
sort
to
put
it
frankly
there
is
an
old
tradition
in
wheeler
s
family
that
a
phantom
bugler
in
that
very
way
announces
an
approaching
good
lord
you
don
t
mean
she
believes
that
she
does
and
what
can
i
say
to
disprove
her
belief
we
all
heard
it
who
could
have
done
such
a
trick
i
don
t
know
who
but
somebody
did
that
bugle
was
played
by
a
pair
of
good
strong
human
by
a
spirit
breath
it
sounded
so
but
that
doesn
t
affect
wheeler
s
belief
if
i
could
produce
the
bugler
and
get
him
to
admit
it
she
might
believe
him
but
otherwise
she
s
sure
it
was
the
traditional
bugler
and
that
earthly
days
are
numbered
for
some
one
of
our
little
you
don
t
believe
this
foolishness
sir
i
can
t
my
nature
rejects
the
very
idea
of
the
supernatural
yet
who
could
or
would
do
it
there
s
no
neighbor
who
would
and
i
know
of
no
one
round
here
who
knows
of
the
oh
pshaw
it
s
the
merest
casual
occurrence
a
boy
scout
like
as
a
gay
young
chap
returning
from
a
merry
party
there
are
lots
of
explanations
quite
apart
from
spooks
i
hope
you
can
persuade
wheeler
of
that
she
is
nervously
ill
and
will
hear
of
no
rational
explanation
for
the
bugle
beg
her
to
come
down
to
breakfast
do
then
we
ll
all
jolly
her
up
until
she
loses
her
but
though
allen
s
attempt
was
a
brave
one
and
ably
seconded
by
wheeler
s
husband
and
daughter
they
made
not
the
slightest
progress
toward
relieving
her
fears
or
disabusing
her
mind
of
her
conviction
chapter
vi
the
other
heir
a
general
air
of
vague
foreboding
hung
over
the
wheeler
household
wheeler
tried
to
rally
from
the
shock
of
the
inexplicable
bugle
call
but
though
she
was
bright
and
cheerful
it
was
fully
evident
that
her
manner
was
forced
and
her
gayety
assumed
maida
solicitous
for
her
mother
was
more
than
ever
resolved
not
to
disclose
the
news
of
another
possible
heir
to
the
estate
though
the
more
she
thought
about
it
the
more
she
felt
sure
samuel
appleby
had
spoken
the
truth
she
decided
that
he
had
learned
of
the
other
heir
and
that
he
was
none
too
honest
to
be
willing
to
keep
the
fact
a
secret
if
in
turn
he
could
serve
his
own
ends
she
did
not
need
to
be
told
that
if
she
would
look
on
young
sam
with
favor
her
father
would
perforce
lend
his
aid
to
the
campaign
and
in
that
case
she
knew
that
the
other
heir
would
never
be
mentioned
again
and
yet
the
acceptance
of
young
sam
was
more
than
she
could
pay
to
give
up
jeff
allen
her
own
true
love
and
marry
a
man
of
such
a
different
type
and
calibre
as
sam
appleby
was
too
much
and
jeff
would
have
something
to
say
about
that
yet
she
must
decide
for
herself
if
she
made
the
supreme
sacrifice
it
must
be
done
as
if
of
her
own
volition
if
her
parents
or
her
lover
guessed
that
she
was
acting
under
compulsion
they
would
put
an
end
to
the
project
but
could
she
even
if
willing
to
sacrifice
herself
could
she
ask
sam
appleby
to
take
her
yet
she
knew
this
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
a
mere
hint
to
appleby
that
she
approved
of
his
son
would
bring
the
younger
man
down
to
the
house
at
once
and
matters
would
then
take
care
of
themselves
but
could
she
do
it
she
looked
at
jeff
as
he
sat
talking
to
her
father
his
strong
fine
face
alight
with
the
earnestness
of
their
discussion
he
was
a
man
of
a
own
jeffrey
no
she
could
not
break
his
had
no
right
to
do
that
it
would
be
a
crime
to
blot
out
the
joy
and
happiness
from
the
eager
young
face
and
then
she
looked
at
the
other
dear
face
her
father
worn
and
aging
but
still
in
rugged
health
could
she
let
the
inevitable
happen
and
see
him
turned
out
of
the
home
that
he
home
that
had
so
long
been
his
sanctuary
his
refuge
from
the
cold
injustice
of
his
and
her
mother
almost
ill
from
her
fright
and
foreboding
to
add
the
disaster
of
poverty
and
she
couldn
t
do
that
and
so
poor
maida
wondered
and
worried
her
thoughts
going
round
in
a
circle
and
coming
back
to
the
two
men
she
loved
and
knew
she
must
break
one
heart
or
the
other
at
one
moment
her
duty
to
her
parents
seemed
pre√´minent
then
again
she
realized
a
duty
to
herself
and
to
the
man
who
loved
her
i
don
t
know
to
do
she
thought
piteously
i
ll
wait
till
appleby
comes
back
here
and
then
i
ll
tell
him
just
how
i
m
placed
perhaps
i
can
appeal
to
his
better
but
maida
wheeler
well
knew
that
however
she
might
appeal
to
samuel
appleby
it
would
be
in
vain
she
knew
from
the
very
fact
that
he
came
to
her
home
and
made
the
offers
and
threats
that
he
did
make
that
his
mind
was
made
up
and
no
power
on
earth
could
move
him
from
his
decision
he
had
a
strong
case
he
probably
thought
the
offer
of
full
pardon
to
dan
wheeler
and
the
offer
to
maida
to
keep
quiet
about
another
heir
would
he
doubtless
thought
be
sufficient
to
win
his
cause
what
an
awful
man
he
is
she
thought
i
wish
he
were
dead
i
know
i
oughtn
t
to
wish
that
but
i
do
i
d
kill
him
myself
if
it
would
help
father
i
oughtn
t
to
say
i
don
t
suppose
i
really
would
do
it
but
it
would
simplify
matters
a
lot
and
somebody
said
we
are
all
capable
of
the
best
of
well
of
course
i
wouldn
t
kill
the
old
man
but
he
d
better
not
give
me
a
real
good
chance
what
are
you
thinking
about
little
girl
asked
allen
turning
to
her
maida
looked
at
him
and
then
at
her
father
and
said
deliberately
i
was
just
thinking
how
i
d
like
to
kill
samuel
senior
junior
or
both
laughed
allen
who
thought
little
of
her
words
save
as
a
jest
senior
i
meant
but
we
may
as
well
make
it
a
wholesale
don
t
maida
her
father
looked
grieved
don
t
speak
flippantly
of
such
well
father
why
not
be
honest
wouldn
t
you
like
to
kill
him
no
but
you
d
be
glad
if
he
were
dead
there
you
needn
t
answer
but
if
you
were
absolutely
honest
you
d
have
to
admit
i
ll
admit
it
said
her
mother
wearily
samuel
appleby
has
spoiled
all
our
still
spoiling
them
he
does
it
for
his
own
selfish
interests
he
has
ruined
the
happiness
of
my
husband
myself
my
daughter
and
my
prospective
is
it
any
wonder
that
we
should
honestly
wish
he
were
dead
it
may
not
sound
it
is
an
honest
expression
of
human
it
is
wheeler
and
allen
s
face
looked
more
pained
than
shocked
but
all
the
same
we
oughtn
t
to
talk
like
no
indeed
agreed
wheeler
please
maida
darling
don
t
say
such
things
and
sara
if
you
must
say
them
say
them
to
me
when
we
are
alone
it
s
no
sort
of
talk
for
these
young
people
s
why
i
said
it
before
mother
did
maida
broke
out
and
i
mean
it
i
m
at
the
end
of
my
rope
if
that
man
is
to
hound
us
and
torture
us
all
our
lives
i
can
t
help
wishing
him
there
there
daughter
please
don
i
won
t
dad
i
ll
never
say
it
again
but
i
put
myself
on
record
and
if
the
rest
of
you
were
honest
you
d
do
the
same
thing
that
we
d
like
to
kill
him
asked
allen
smiling
at
the
idea
i
didn
t
say
said
we
wish
him
dead
if
a
nice
convenient
stroke
of
lightning
came
his
way
maida
hush
her
father
spoke
sternly
i
won
t
allow
such
talk
it
isn
t
like
you
my
child
and
it
isn
isn
t
good
form
i
s
pose
she
interrupted
well
i
ll
let
up
dads
and
i
am
a
little
ashamed
of
myself
mother
maybe
the
phantom
bugler
was
announcing
the
death
of
old
appleby
hush
maida
what
has
got
into
you
i
m
incorrigible
i
you
are
and
allen
smiled
fondly
at
her
come
out
for
a
walk
in
the
sunshine
with
me
and
get
these
awful
thoughts
out
of
your
i
know
i
m
a
criminal
said
maida
as
they
walked
down
a
garden
path
but
i
can
t
help
it
i
ve
more
to
bear
than
you
know
of
jeff
and
you
must
make
i
do
sweetheart
and
i
know
how
you
re
troubled
and
all
that
but
don
t
say
such
dreadful
things
i
know
you
don
t
mean
no
i
don
least
i
don
t
think
i
do
but
i
won
t
say
them
any
more
i
think
i
lost
my
forget
it
you
re
upset
and
nervous
and
your
mother
s
worry
reflects
itself
on
you
is
there
really
a
bugler
tradition
not
over
here
there
was
one
connected
with
mother
s
family
long
ago
in
england
i
believe
of
course
it
was
just
one
of
those
old
spook
yarns
that
most
old
houses
have
over
there
but
mother
always
remembered
it
she
has
told
everybody
who
ever
visited
here
about
it
and
i
think
she
always
expected
to
hear
the
thing
queer
though
wasn
t
it
not
very
it
s
explainable
by
natural
means
of
course
probably
we
ll
never
know
who
it
was
but
it
was
no
phantom
be
sure
of
oh
well
it
doesn
t
matter
except
that
it
has
upset
mother
so
dreadfully
but
she
ll
get
over
nothing
nothing
will
by
that
you
mean
a
death
in
the
family
more
likely
a
marriage
will
take
place
not
ours
jeff
i
think
that
bugler
sounded
the
of
our
maida
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
are
you
talking
like
that
i
know
you
ve
something
on
your
mind
that
you
haven
t
told
me
yet
something
pretty
serious
for
it
makes
you
say
the
strangest
things
tell
me
darling
won
t
you
i
can
t
jeff
i
mean
there
isn
t
anything
wait
till
those
people
come
back
again
you
ll
be
here
won
t
you
they
re
coming
you
bet
i
will
i
ll
see
what
i
can
do
with
old
curmudgeon
you
know
i
m
that
won
t
do
any
good
with
appleby
what
he
wants
is
help
from
dad
if
he
doesn
t
get
that
he
ll
punish
us
and
he
can
t
get
that
for
your
dad
won
t
give
it
so
it
looks
as
if
we
must
all
take
our
punishment
well
we
re
you
wouldn
t
speak
so
lightly
if
you
knew
everything
that
s
why
i
ask
you
to
tell
me
everything
do
maida
i
m
sure
i
can
help
wait
till
they
come
was
all
maida
would
say
in
response
to
his
repeated
requests
and
at
last
they
came
smiling
and
hearty
samuel
appleby
re√´ntered
the
wheeler
home
apparently
as
and
hopeful
as
when
he
left
it
keefe
was
courteous
and
polite
as
always
and
genevieve
lane
was
prettier
than
ever
by
reason
of
some
new
clothes
allen
was
introduced
to
the
newcomers
and
sized
up
by
one
glance
of
samuel
appleby
s
keen
eyes
privately
he
decided
that
this
young
man
was
a
very
formidable
rival
of
his
son
but
he
greeted
allen
with
great
cordiality
which
jeff
thought
it
best
to
return
although
he
felt
an
instinctive
dislike
for
the
man
s
personality
come
along
with
me
maida
and
with
daring
familiarity
genevieve
put
her
hand
through
maida
s
arm
and
drew
her
toward
the
stairs

have
the
same
room

s
pose

babbled
on
i
ve
lots
of
new
things

she
added
as
they
entered
the
room
and
she
closed
the
door
i
want
a
talkfest
with
you
before
the
others
what
about
asked
maida
feeling
the
subject
would
be
one
of
importance
well
it
s
just
this
and
don
t
be
too
shocked
if
i
speak
right
out
in
meetin
i
ve
determined
to
marry
into
this
bunch
that
i
m
working
have
you
laughed
maida
are
they
equally
determined
i
m
not
m
in
dead
earnest
a
poor
girl
has
got
to
do
the
best
she
can
for
herself
in
this
cold
world
well
i
m
going
to
corral
one
of
the
three
old
man
appleby
young
man
appleby
or
curt
which
one
for
choice
maida
still
spoke
lightly
you
don
t
think
i
m
in
earnest
but
i
am
well
i
d
rather
have
young
sam
next
i
d
choose
his
father
and
lastly
i
m
pretty
sure
i
could
nail
curtie
maida
couldn
t
help
her
disapproval
showing
in
her
face
but
she
said
it
isn
t
just
the
way
i
d
go
about
selecting
a
husband
but
if
it
s
your
way
all
right
can
i
help
you
do
you
mean
that
why
yes
if
i
can
do
anything
oh
you
can
it
s
only
to
keep
off
the
grass
regarding
young
you
mean
not
to
try
to
charm
him
myself
just
about
that
and
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
say
this
it
seems
old
appleby
has
about
made
up
his
mind
that
you
re
the
right
and
proper
mate
for
young
appleby
oh
you
needn
t
draw
yourself
up
in
that
haughty
s
good
enough
for
you
miss
i
didn
t
say
he
wasn
t
and
maida
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
at
genevieve
s
manner
but
truly
i
don
t
want
him
you
see
i
m
engaged
to
i
know
it
but
that
cuts
no
ice
with
pa
appleby
he
plans
to
oust
allen
and
put
his
son
in
his
oh
he
does
does
he
maida
s
heart
sank
for
she
had
anticipated
something
like
this
am
i
to
be
consulted
now
look
here
maida
wheeler
you
needn
t
take
that
attitude
for
it
won
t
get
you
anywhere
you
don
t
know
appleby
as
i
do
what
he
says
understand
maida
went
white
but
such
a
thing
as
you
speak
of
won
t
go
she
exclaimed
i
m
not
sure
it
won
t
if
he
so
ordains
it
miss
lane
said
gravely
but
i
just
wanted
your
assurance
that
you
don
t
hanker
after
so
i
can
go
ahead
and
annex
him
in
defiance
of
appleby
s
intents
i
may
be
able
to
circumvent
him
i
m
some
little
schemer
myself
and
he
may
what
yep
he
has
an
unsatisfactory
heart
and
it
may
go
back
on
him
at
any
what
a
thing
to
bank
on
it
may
happen
all
the
same
but
i
ve
other
irons
in
the
fire
run
along
now
i
ve
work
to
do
you
re
a
dear
girl
maida
and
the
time
may
come
when
i
can
help
the
round
face
looked
very
serious
and
maida
said
gratefully
i
may
be
very
glad
of
such
help
then
she
went
away
samuel
appleby
was
lying
in
wait
for
her
here
you
are
my
girl
he
said
as
she
came
downstairs
come
for
a
ramble
with
me
won
t
you
and
knowing
that
the
encounter
was
inevitable
maida
went
appleby
wasted
no
time
in
preliminaries
i
ve
got
to
go
home
morning
he
said
i
ve
got
to
have
this
matter
of
your
father
s
help
in
the
campaign
settled
before
i
i
thought
it
was
settled
returned
maida
calmly
you
know
he
will
never
give
you
the
help
you
ask
and
oh
please
appleby
won
t
you
give
up
the
question
you
have
ruined
my
father
s
our
lives
won
t
you
cease
bothering
him
and
whether
you
let
him
get
his
full
pardon
or
not
won
t
you
stop
trying
to
coerce
his
will
no
i
will
not
you
are
very
pleading
and
persuasive
my
girl
but
i
have
my
own
ax
to
grind
now
here
s
a
proposition
if
ll
speak
you
will
consent
to
marry
my
son
i
ll
get
your
father
s
full
pardon
and
i
ll
not
ask
for
his
campaign
maida
gasped
all
her
troubles
removed
at
at
such
a
price
she
thought
of
allen
and
a
great
wave
of
love
surged
over
her
oh
i
can
can
t
she
moaned
what
you
appleby
i
love
my
chosen
mate
my
jeffrey
allen
would
you
ask
me
to
give
him
up
and
marry
your
son
whom
i
esteem
highly
but
do
not
love
certainly
i
ask
just
that
you
are
free
to
say
yes
or
no
then
i
say
no
there
be
some
other
way
give
me
some
other
chance
even
though
it
be
a
harder
one
all
right
i
appleby
s
face
was
hard
now
his
lips
set
in
a
straight
line
he
was
about
to
play
his
last
card
all
right
i
will
here
it
is
the
other
heir
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
the
other
day
is
curtis
mr
keefe
doesn
t
know
it
i
hit
upon
a
clue
in
his
chance
reference
to
his
mother
s
family
and
unknown
to
him
i
investigated
genealogies
and
all
that
and
it
is
positive
he
is
the
heir
to
all
this
estate
and
not
your
you
re
sure
yes
absolutely
certain
but
remember
he
doesn
t
know
it
he
has
no
idea
of
such
a
thing
now
if
you
ll
marry
sam
keefe
shall
know
i
ll
burn
all
the
papers
that
i
have
in
evidence
you
and
i
will
forget
the
secret
and
your
father
and
mother
can
rest
in
undisturbed
possession
here
for
the
rest
of
their
and
you
wouldn
t
insist
on
father
s
campaign
work
if
you
marry
my
son
i
rather
think
your
father
will
lend
his
least
in
some
few
matters
without
urging
but
he
shall
not
be
urged
beyond
his
wishes
rest
assured
of
that
in
a
word
maida
all
that
you
want
or
desire
shall
be
yours
except
your
choice
of
a
husband
and
i
ll
wager
that
inside
of
a
year
you
ll
be
wondering
what
you
ever
saw
in
young
allen
and
rejoicing
that
you
are
the
wife
of
the
governor
instead
i
can
t
do
can
t
and
then
too
there
s
the
heirship
mr
keefe
and
the
airship
exclaimed
curtis
keefe
himself
as
he
came
round
the
corner
and
met
them
face
to
face
am
i
to
go
up
in
an
airship
and
when
appleby
flashed
a
quick
glance
at
maida
which
she
rightly
interpreted
to
mean
to
let
keefe
rest
unenlightened
as
to
his
error
you
re
not
the
keefe
we
meant
said
appleby
smiling
at
his
secretary
there
are
and
then
appleby
walked
away
feeling
his
best
plan
was
to
let
maida
think
things
over
what
keefe
is
going
up
in
an
airship
curt
insisted
his
curiosity
aroused
i
don
t
know
said
maida
listlessly
mr
appleby
was
telling
me
some
airship
yarn
i
didn
t
half
listen
can
t
bear
that
man
i
can
t
blame
you
for
that
miss
wheeler
but
we
re
going
away
and
he
ll
be
out
of
your
no
he
has
me
in
a
trap
he
has
arranged
it
what
am
i
saying
don
t
go
on
if
you
feel
you
might
regret
it
of
course
as
appleby
s
confidential
secretary
i
know
most
of
his
affairs
may
i
say
that
i
m
very
sorry
for
you
and
may
i
offer
my
help
if
you
can
use
me
in
any
way
how
kind
you
are
keefe
but
if
you
know
the
details
of
the
matter
you
know
that
i
am
in
a
fearful
dilemma
oh
if
only
that
man
were
out
of
existence
oh
miss
wheeler
and
keefe
looked
undisguisedly
shocked
i
don
t
mean
anything
wrong
maida
s
eyes
were
piteous
but
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
i
ve
no
one
to
confide
way
to
turn
for
why
miss
wheeler
you
have
parents
no
one
that
i
can
speak
to
forgive
me
keefe
but
i
am
nearly
out
of
my
mind
forgive
me
if
i
ask
you
to
leave
you
of
course
you
poor
child
i
ought
to
have
sensed
that
i
was
intruding
with
a
courteous
bow
he
walked
away
leaving
maida
alone
on
the
seat
beneath
the
old
sycamore
she
thought
long
and
deeply
she
seemed
to
grow
older
and
more
matured
of
judgment
as
she
dealt
with
the
big
questions
in
her
mind
after
a
long
time
she
came
to
her
decision
torn
and
wracked
with
emotions
she
bravely
faced
the
situation
and
made
up
her
mind
then
she
got
up
and
walked
into
the
house
that
afternoon
about
five
o
clock
appleby
and
wheeler
sat
in
the
latter
s
den
talking
over
the
same
old
subject
maida
hidden
in
the
was
listening
they
did
not
know
she
was
there
but
they
would
not
have
cared
they
talked
of
nothing
she
did
not
already
know
appleby
grew
angry
and
wheeler
grew
angry
the
talk
was
coming
to
a
climax
both
men
were
holding
on
to
their
tempers
but
it
was
clear
one
or
the
other
must
give
way
soon
jeffrey
allen
about
to
go
in
search
of
maida
saw
a
wisp
of
smoke
curling
from
the
garage
which
from
his
seat
on
the
north
veranda
was
in
plain
view
he
ran
toward
the
smoke
shouting
fire
as
he
ran
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
garage
was
ablaze
the
servants
gathered
about
wheeler
looked
from
her
bedroom
window
and
keefe
joined
allen
in
attempts
to
subdue
the
flames
and
with
the
efficient
help
of
two
chauffeurs
and
other
willing
workers
the
fire
was
soon
reduced
to
a
smouldering
heap
of
ashes
allen
ran
then
to
the
den
to
tell
them
there
that
the
danger
was
past
he
entered
to
see
samuel
appleby
dead
in
his
chair
with
a
bullet
through
his
heart
daniel
wheeler
stood
beside
him
gazing
distractedly
at
the
dead
man
maida
white
and
trembling
was
half
hidden
as
she
stood
just
inside
the
curtains
of
the
window
not
realizing
that
there
was
no
hope
of
life
allen
shouted
for
help
and
tore
open
appleby
s
coat
to
feel
his
heart
he
s
quite
dead
he
said
in
an
tone
but
we
must
get
a
doctor
at
once
i
ll
telephone
spoke
up
genevieve
s
quiet
voice
and
with
her
usual
efficiency
she
found
the
number
and
called
the
doctor
now
the
police
she
went
on
as
if
such
matters
belonged
to
her
province
certainly
said
curtis
keefe
who
stood
by
his
late
employer
taking
charge
by
common
consent
who
killed
him
said
genevieve
in
a
hushed
tone
as
she
left
the
telephone
all
looked
from
one
to
another
but
nobody
replied
wheeler
came
to
the
doorway
i
knew
it
she
cried
the
phantom
bugler
but
the
phantom
bugler
didn
t
kill
him
said
genevieve
and
we
must
find
out
who
did
chapter
vii
inquiries
late
the
same
evening
the
wheeler
family
and
their
guests
were
gathered
in
the
much
had
been
done
in
the
past
few
hours
the
family
doctor
had
been
there
the
medical
examiner
had
been
called
and
had
given
his
report
and
the
police
had
come
and
were
still
present
samuel
appleby
no
longer
to
be
called
by
that
expected
at
any
moment
two
detectives
were
there
but
one
hallen
by
name
said
almost
nothing
seeming
content
to
listen
while
his
colleague
conducted
the
questioning
of
the
household
burdon
the
talkative
one
was
a
chap
decided
of
manner
and
short
of
speech
now
look
here
he
was
saying
this
was
an
inside
job
of
course
might
have
been
one
of
the
servants
or
might
have
been
any
of
you
folks
how
many
of
you
are
ready
to
help
me
in
my
investigations
by
telling
all
you
know
i
thought
we
had
to
do
that
whether
we
re
ready
to
or
not
spoke
up
genevieve
who
was
not
at
all
abashed
by
the
presence
of
the
authorities
of
course
we
ll
all
tell
all
we
want
to
find
the
murderer
just
as
much
as
you
keefe
looked
at
her
with
a
slight
frown
of
reproof
but
said
nothing
the
others
paid
no
attention
to
the
girl
s
rather
forward
speech
in
fact
everybody
seemed
dazed
and
dumb
the
thing
was
so
sudden
and
so
possibilities
so
many
and
so
each
was
aghast
at
the
situation
the
three
wheelers
said
nothing
now
and
then
they
looked
at
one
another
but
quickly
looked
away
and
preserved
their
unbroken
silence
jeffrey
allen
became
the
spokesman
for
them
it
seemed
some
one
must
answer
the
first
leading
questions
and
though
curtis
keefe
and
miss
lane
were
in
appleby
s
employ
the
detective
seemed
more
concerned
with
the
wheeler
family
bad
blood
wasn
t
there
between
appleby
and
wheeler
burdon
inquired
they
had
not
been
friends
for
years
allen
replied
straightforwardly
for
he
felt
sure
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
misrepresentation
huh
what
was
the
trouble
wheeler
daniel
wheeler
gave
a
start
then
pulling
himself
together
he
answered
slowly
the
trouble
was
that
appleby
and
myself
belonged
to
different
political
parties
and
when
i
opposed
his
election
as
governor
he
resented
it
and
a
mutual
enmity
followed
which
lasted
ever
did
you
kill
appleby
wheeler
looked
at
his
questioner
steadily
and
replied
i
have
nothing
to
that
s
all
right
you
don
t
have
to
incriminate
he
didn
t
kill
him
cried
maida
unable
to
keep
still
i
was
there
in
the
could
see
that
he
didn
t
kill
him
who
did
then
and
the
detective
turned
to
her
don
t
know
i
didn
t
see
who
did
are
you
sure
miss
better
tell
the
i
tell
you
i
didn
t
didn
t
see
anything
i
had
heard
an
alarm
of
fire
and
i
was
wondering
where
it
you
didn
t
get
up
and
go
to
find
out
i
stayed
where
i
where
were
you
in
the
the
meaning
the
room
where
the
shooting
occurred
yes
my
father
s
and
from
where
you
sat
you
could
see
the
whole
affair
i
might
i
had
i
didn
t
i
was
thought
you
were
wondering
about
the
fire
yes
maida
was
quite
composed
now
i
raised
my
eyes
from
my
book
when
i
heard
the
fire
what
sort
of
excitement
i
heard
people
shouting
and
i
heard
men
running
i
was
just
about
to
go
out
toward
the
north
veranda
where
the
sounds
came
from
when
i
can
t
go
on
and
maida
broke
down
and
wept
you
must
tell
your
it
d
be
easier
now
than
later
can
t
you
go
on
miss
wheeler
there
s
little
to
tell
i
saw
appleby
fall
over
didn
t
you
hear
the
shot
don
t
maida
looked
at
her
father
as
if
to
gain
help
from
his
expression
but
his
face
showed
only
agonized
concern
for
her
dear
child
he
said
tell
the
truth
tell
just
what
you
i
didn
t
hear
mean
the
noise
from
the
people
running
to
the
fire
so
distracted
my
attention
i
heard
no
shot
or
any
sound
in
the
room
i
just
saw
appleby
fall
you
re
not
giving
us
a
straight
story
miss
wheeler
said
the
detective
bluntly
seems
to
me
you
d
better
begin
all
seems
to
me
you
d
better
cease
questioning
miss
wheeler
said
curtis
keefe
looking
sympathetically
at
maida
she
s
just
about
all
in
and
i
think
she
s
entitled
to
some
h
m
pretty
hard
to
find
the
right
one
to
question
wheeler
d
rather
not
trouble
her
too
talk
to
me
said
allen
i
can
tell
you
the
facts
and
you
can
draw
your
deductions
me
too
said
keefe
ask
us
the
hard
questions
and
then
when
you
need
to
inquire
of
the
wheelers
remember
they
re
under
great
nervous
well
then
burdon
seemed
willing
to
take
the
advice
you
start
in
keefe
you
re
appleby
s
secretary
i
believe
yes
we
were
on
our
way
back
to
his
home
in
expected
to
go
there
you
got
any
theory
of
the
shooting
i
ve
nothing
to
found
a
theory
on
i
was
out
at
the
garage
helping
to
put
out
a
small
fire
that
had
started
how
d
it
start
i
don
t
know
in
the
excitement
that
followed
i
never
thought
to
tell
your
story
of
the
i
was
at
the
garage
with
allen
and
two
wheelers
man
and
appleby
s
man
together
and
with
the
help
of
a
gardener
or
two
we
put
the
fire
out
then
allen
said
let
s
go
to
the
house
and
tell
them
there
s
no
danger
they
may
be
allen
started
off
and
i
followed
he
preceded
me
into
the
then
you
tell
what
you
saw
there
i
saw
first
of
all
began
jeffrey
the
figure
of
appleby
sitting
in
a
chair
near
the
middle
of
the
room
his
head
hung
forward
limply
and
his
whole
attitude
was
unnatural
the
thought
flashed
through
my
mind
that
he
had
had
a
stroke
of
some
sort
and
i
went
to
i
saw
he
was
you
knew
that
at
once
i
judged
so
from
the
look
on
his
face
and
the
helpless
attitude
then
i
felt
for
his
heart
and
found
it
was
you
a
doctor
no
but
i
ve
had
enough
experience
to
know
when
a
man
is
all
right
what
was
wheeler
doing
nothing
he
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
gazing
at
his
old
and
miss
wheeler
she
too
was
looking
at
the
scene
she
stood
in
the
bay
i
see
now
keefe
i
believe
you
followed
close
on
allen
s
heels
did
you
see
the
as
he
has
described
it
yes
keefe
looked
thoughtful
yes
i
think
i
can
corroborate
every
word
of
his
all
right
now
miss
lane
where
were
you
i
was
at
the
fire
i
followed
the
two
men
in
and
i
saw
the
same
situation
they
have
told
you
genevieve
s
quiet
composed
air
was
a
relief
after
the
somewhat
excited
utterances
of
the
others
what
did
you
do
i
am
accustomed
to
wait
on
appleby
and
it
seemed
quite
within
my
province
that
i
should
telephone
for
help
for
him
i
called
the
then
i
called
the
police
you
don
t
think
you
took
a
great
deal
on
yourself
genevieve
stared
at
him
i
do
not
think
so
i
only
think
that
i
did
my
duty
as
i
saw
it
and
in
similar
circumstances
i
should
do
the
same
at
this
point
the
other
detective
was
heard
from
i
would
like
to
ask
hallen
said
what
wheeler
meant
by
crying
out
that
it
was
the
work
of
a
phantom
burglar
not
said
wheeler
suddenly
alert
bugler
hallen
stared
please
explain
ma
there
is
a
tradition
in
my
family
wheeler
said
in
a
slow
sad
voice
that
when
a
member
of
the
family
is
about
to
die
a
phantom
bugler
makes
an
appearance
and
sounds
taps
on
his
bugle
this
phenomenon
occurred
last
oh
no
spooks
but
appleby
is
not
a
member
of
your
no
but
he
was
under
our
roof
and
so
i
know
the
warning
was
meant
for
well
well
we
can
t
waste
time
on
such
rubbish
interposed
burdon
the
bugle
call
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
how
do
you
explain
it
then
asked
wheeler
we
all
heard
it
and
there
s
no
bugler
about
cut
it
out
ordered
burdon
take
up
the
bugler
business
some
other
time
if
you
we
must
get
down
to
brass
tacks
his
proceedings
were
interrupted
however
by
the
arrival
of
young
samuel
appleby
the
big
man
came
in
and
a
sudden
hush
fell
upon
the
group
daniel
wheeler
put
out
a
tentative
hand
then
half
withdrew
it
as
if
he
feared
it
would
not
be
accepted
hallen
watched
this
closely
he
strongly
suspected
wheeler
was
the
murderer
but
he
had
no
intention
of
getting
himself
in
bad
by
jumping
at
the
conclusion
however
appleby
grasped
the
hand
of
his
host
as
if
he
had
no
reason
for
not
doing
so
i
m
sorry
sir
you
should
have
had
this
tragedy
beneath
your
roof
he
said
hallen
listened
curiously
it
was
strange
he
should
adopt
an
apologetic
tone
as
if
wheeler
had
been
imposed
upon
our
sorrow
is
all
for
you
sam
dan
wheeler
returned
and
then
as
appleby
passed
on
to
greet
maida
and
her
mother
wheeler
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
was
again
lost
in
thought
the
whole
scene
was
one
of
constraint
appleby
merely
nodded
to
genevieve
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
keefe
and
then
asked
to
see
his
father
on
his
return
to
the
he
had
a
slightly
different
air
he
was
a
little
more
dictatorial
more
ready
to
advise
what
to
do
the
circumstances
are
distressing
he
said
and
i
know
wheeler
you
will
agree
with
me
that
we
should
take
my
father
back
to
his
home
as
soon
as
possible
that
will
be
done
soon
as
the
necessary
formalities
can
be
attended
to
now
anything
i
can
do
for
you
people
must
be
done
you
can
do
a
lot
said
burdon
you
can
help
us
pick
out
the
i
take
it
you
want
justice
done
of
appleby
looked
surprised
of
course
i
want
this
deed
avenged
but
i
can
t
help
in
the
matter
i
understand
you
suspect
some
one
of
household
now
i
shall
never
be
willing
to
accuse
any
one
of
this
deed
if
it
can
be
proved
the
work
of
an
burglar
or
intruder
of
any
sort
i
am
ready
to
if
suspicion
rests
anyone
i
shall
keep
out
of
you
can
t
do
that
appleby
said
hallen
you
ve
got
to
tell
all
you
but
i
don
t
know
anything
i
wasn
t
here
you
know
about
motives
hallen
said
doggedly
tell
us
now
who
bore
your
father
any
and
also
had
opportunity
to
do
the
shooting
i
shan
t
pretend
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
driving
at
and
appleby
spoke
sternly
but
i
ve
no
idea
that
daniel
wheeler
did
this
deed
i
know
he
and
my
father
were
not
on
friendly
terms
but
you
need
more
evidence
than
that
to
accuse
a
man
of
we
ll
look
after
the
evidence
hallen
assured
him
all
you
need
tell
about
is
the
enmity
between
the
two
an
enmity
of
fifteen
years
standing
appleby
said
slowly
is
not
apt
to
break
out
in
sudden
flame
of
crime
i
am
not
a
judge
nor
am
i
a
detective
but
until
wheeler
himself
confesses
to
the
deed
i
shall
never
believe
he
shot
my
wheeler
looked
at
the
speaker
in
a
sort
of
dumb
wonder
maida
gazed
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
thankfulness
and
the
others
were
deeply
impressed
by
the
just
even
noble
attitude
of
the
son
of
the
victim
of
the
tragedy
but
hallen
mused
over
this
thing
he
wondered
why
appleby
took
such
an
unusual
stand
and
decided
there
was
something
back
of
it
about
which
he
knew
nothing
as
yet
and
he
determined
to
find
out
we
can
get
in
touch
with
you
at
any
time
appleby
he
asked
oh
yes
of
course
after
a
few
my
father
s
funeral
i
will
be
at
your
disposal
but
as
i
ve
said
i
know
nothing
that
would
be
of
any
use
as
evidence
do
you
need
to
keep
keefe
and
miss
lane
for
any
reason
why
i
don
t
think
so
the
detective
said
not
longer
than
anyhow
i
ll
take
their
depositions
but
they
have
little
testimony
to
give
however
you
re
none
of
you
very
far
no
you
can
always
get
us
at
stockfield
keefe
will
probably
be
willing
to
stay
on
and
settle
up
my
father
s
affairs
and
i
know
we
shall
be
glad
of
miss
lane
s
services
for
a
appleby
glanced
at
the
two
as
he
spoke
and
they
nodded
well
we
re
going
to
stay
right
here
and
burdon
spoke
decidedly
whatever
the
truth
of
the
matter
may
be
it
s
clear
to
be
seen
that
suspicion
must
naturally
point
toward
the
wheeler
family
or
some
intruder
though
how
an
intruder
could
get
in
the
room
unseen
by
either
wheeler
or
his
daughter
is
pretty
inexplicable
but
those
things
we
re
here
to
find
out
and
we
ll
do
it
appleby
i
m
taking
it
for
granted
you
want
the
criminal
found
say
have
a
little
common
decency
don
t
come
at
me
with
questions
of
that
sort
when
i
m
just
about
knocked
out
with
this
whole
fearful
occurrence
have
a
heart
man
give
me
time
to
realize
my
loss
before
you
talk
to
me
of
avenging
it
that
s
right
said
curt
keefe
i
think
appleby
deserves
more
consideration
suppose
we
excuse
him
for
the
somewhat
reluctantly
the
detective
was
brought
to
consent
and
then
daniel
wheeler
asked
that
he
and
his
wife
and
daughter
also
be
excused
from
further
grilling
that
night
we
re
not
going
to
run
away
he
said
pathetically
we
ll
meet
you
in
the
morning
burdon
but
please
realize
our
stunned
condition
at
my
mother
must
be
excused
maida
put
in
i
am
sure
she
can
stand
no
more
and
with
a
solicitous
care
she
assisted
wheeler
to
rise
from
her
chair
yes
i
am
ill
the
elder
woman
said
and
so
white
and
weak
did
she
look
that
no
one
could
doubt
her
word
the
three
wheelers
went
to
their
room
and
genevieve
lane
went
off
with
them
leaving
allen
and
keefe
with
sam
appleby
to
face
the
two
detectives
fire
of
questions
you
vamoose
too
sam
keefe
advised
there
s
no
use
in
your
staying
here
and
listening
to
harrowing
details
allen
and
i
will
have
a
talk
with
the
detectives
and
you
can
talk
morning
if
you
all
right
and
appleby
rose
but
look
here
keefe
i
loved
and
respected
my
father
and
i
revere
his
yes
i
want
justice
course
but
all
the
same
if
wheeler
shot
dad
i
don
t
want
that
poor
old
chap
prosecuted
you
know
i
never
fully
sympathized
with
father
s
treatment
of
him
and
i
d
like
to
make
amends
to
wheeler
by
giving
him
the
benefit
of
the
it
can
be
it
can
t
be
done
declared
burdon
unwilling
to
agree
to
this
heresy
the
law
can
t
be
set
aside
by
personal
sympathy
appleby
well
i
only
said
if
it
can
be
and
the
man
wearily
turned
and
left
the
room
now
then
said
keefe
let
s
talk
this
thing
out
i
know
your
position
allen
and
i
m
sorry
for
you
and
i
want
to
say
right
now
if
i
can
help
in
any
way
i
will
i
like
the
wheelers
and
i
must
say
i
subscribe
to
the
ideas
of
sam
appleby
but
all
that
s
up
to
the
detectives
i
ve
got
to
go
away
so
i
m
going
to
ask
you
burdon
to
get
through
with
me
i
ve
lots
to
do
at
the
other
end
of
the
route
and
i
must
get
busy
but
i
do
want
to
help
here
too
so
at
any
rate
fire
your
questions
at
is
if
you
know
what
you
want
to
i
ll
ask
one
right
off
keefe
and
hallen
spoke
mildly
but
straightforwardly
can
you
give
me
any
fact
or
suggest
to
me
any
theory
that
points
toward
any
one
but
daniel
wheeler
as
the
murderer
of
samuel
appleby
curtis
keefe
was
dismayed
what
could
he
reply
to
this
very
definite
question
a
negative
answer
implicated
wheeler
at
a
yes
would
necessitate
the
disclosure
of
another
suspect
and
keefe
was
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
hallen
s
eyes
had
strayed
more
than
once
toward
maida
wheeler
with
a
curious
glance
quickly
making
up
his
mind
keefe
returned
no
fact
but
a
theory
based
on
my
disbelief
in
wheeler
s
guilt
and
implying
the
intrusion
of
some
meaning
some
marauder
hallen
looked
disdainful
some
intruder
keefe
said
i
don
t
know
who
or
for
what
reason
but
i
don
t
think
it
fair
to
accuse
wheeler
without
investigating
every
possible
there
are
several
alternatives
burdon
declared
i
may
as
well
say
right
out
that
i
ve
no
more
definite
suspicion
of
wheeler
than
i
have
of
wheeler
or
miss
what
and
jeffrey
allen
looked
almost
murderous
himself
don
t
get
excited
sir
it
s
my
business
to
suspect
suspicion
is
not
accusation
you
must
admit
all
three
of
the
wheeler
family
had
a
motive
that
is
they
would
one
and
all
have
been
glad
to
be
released
from
the
thrall
in
which
appleby
held
them
and
no
one
else
present
had
a
motive
i
might
suspect
you
allen
but
that
you
were
at
the
fire
at
the
time
according
to
the
direct
testimony
of
oh
yes
we
were
at
the
fire
all
right
allen
agreed
and
i
d
knock
you
down
for
saying
to
me
what
you
did
only
you
are
justified
i
would
far
rather
be
suspected
of
the
murder
of
appleby
than
to
have
any
of
the
wheelers
suspected
but
owing
to
keefe
s
being
an
of
me
at
the
time
i
can
t
falsify
about
it
however
you
may
set
it
right
down
that
none
of
the
three
wheelers
did
do
it
and
i
ll
prove
it
go
to
it
allen
keefe
cried
i
ll
you
re
two
loyal
friends
of
the
wheeler
family
said
hallen
in
his
quiet
way
but
you
can
t
put
anything
over
there
s
no
way
out
i
know
all
about
the
governor
s
pardon
and
all
that
i
know
the
feud
between
the
two
men
was
beyond
all
hope
of
patching
up
and
i
know
that
had
brought
about
a
climax
that
had
to
result
in
tragedy
if
wheeler
hadn
t
killed
would
have
killed
asked
allen
no
sir
not
that
but
one
or
the
other
had
to
be
out
of
the
running
i
know
the
whole
story
and
i
know
what
men
will
do
in
a
political
crisis
that
they
wouldn
t
dream
of
at
any
other
time
wheeler
s
the
guilty
unless
that
daughter
of
hush
cried
allen
i
won
t
stand
for
it
i
only
meant
that
the
girl
s
great
love
and
loyalty
to
her
father
might
have
made
her
lose
her
no
she
didn
t
do
it
said
allen
more
quietly
oh
i
say
man
let
s
try
to
find
this
intruder
that
keefe
has
invented
put
in
burdon
no
gentlemen
they
ain
t
no
such
animile
now
you
tell
me
over
again
while
i
take
it
down
just
what
you
two
saw
when
you
came
to
the
door
of
that
den
as
they
call
and
so
allen
and
keefe
reluctantly
but
truthfully
again
detailed
the
scene
that
met
their
eyes
as
they
returned
from
the
fire
they
had
put
out
the
case
is
only
too
plain
declared
burdon
as
he
snapped
a
rubber
band
over
his
notebook
sorry
gentlemen
but
your
story
leaves
no
loophole
for
any
other
suspect
than
one
of
the
three
wheelers
chapter
viii
confession
before
sam
appleby
left
the
next
morning
he
confided
to
keefe
that
he
had
little
if
any
faith
in
the
detective
prowess
of
the
two
men
investigating
the
case
when
i
come
back
he
said
i
may
bring
a
real
detective
may
not
i
want
to
think
this
thing
over
though
i
may
be
a
queer
dick
i
m
not
sure
i
want
the
slayer
of
my
father
i
see
and
keefe
nodded
his
head
understandingly
but
jeffrey
allen
demurred
you
say
that
appleby
because
you
think
one
of
the
wheeler
family
is
the
guilty
party
but
i
know
better
i
know
them
so
not
as
well
as
i
do
interrupted
appleby
and
neither
do
you
know
all
the
points
of
the
feud
that
has
festered
for
so
many
years
if
you
ll
take
my
advice
allen
you
ll
delay
action
until
my
return
at
the
detectives
won
t
do
that
objected
jeffrey
the
detectives
will
run
round
in
circles
and
get
nowhere
scoffed
appleby
i
shall
be
back
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
now
that
there
will
be
no
election
campaign
for
what
exclaimed
curtis
keefe
you
re
out
of
the
running
positively
i
may
take
it
up
again
some
other
year
but
this
campaign
will
not
include
my
my
gracious
exclaimed
genevieve
who
knew
a
great
deal
about
current
politics
who
ll
take
your
place
a
dark
horse
likely
returned
appleby
speaking
in
an
absorbed
preoccupied
manner
as
if
caring
little
who
fell
heir
to
his
candidacy
i
don
t
agree
with
you
appleby
spoke
up
jeff
allen
as
to
the
inefficiency
of
the
two
men
on
this
case
seems
to
me
they
re
doing
all
they
can
and
i
can
t
help
thinking
they
may
get
at
the
all
right
if
they
get
at
the
truth
but
it
s
my
opinion
that
the
truth
of
this
matter
is
not
going
to
be
so
easily
discovered
and
those
two
bunglers
may
do
a
great
deal
of
harm
maida
keep
up
a
good
heart
my
the
group
on
the
veranda
said
to
sam
appleby
and
he
turned
back
as
he
stepped
into
the
car
to
say
i
ll
be
back
as
soon
as
the
funeral
is
over
and
until
then
be
careful
what
you
of
he
looked
seriously
at
maida
but
his
glance
turned
toward
the
den
where
wheeler
sat
in
solitude
i
heard
him
stormed
burdon
as
the
car
drove
away
and
the
detective
came
around
the
corner
of
the
veranda
i
heard
what
he
said
about
me
and
hallen
well
we
ll
show
him
of
course
the
reason
he
talks
like
don
t
tell
us
the
reason
just
now
interrupted
keefe
we
men
will
have
a
little
session
of
our
own
without
the
ladies
present
there
s
no
call
for
their
participation
in
our
that
s
right
said
allen
maida
you
and
miss
lane
run
away
and
we
ll
go
to
the
den
for
a
no
not
there
objected
burdon
come
over
and
sit
under
the
big
and
so
beneath
the
historic
tree
the
three
men
sat
down
for
a
serious
talk
hallen
soon
joined
them
but
he
said
little
i
m
leaving
myself
soon
after
noon
said
keefe
i
ll
be
back
in
a
day
or
two
but
there
are
matters
of
importance
connected
with
appleby
s
estate
that
must
be
looked
i
should
think
there
must
be
exclaimed
burdon
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
leave
to
come
back
very
keefe
reddened
slightly
for
the
real
reason
for
his
intended
return
was
centred
in
maida
wheeler
s
charm
to
which
he
had
incontinently
succumbed
he
knew
allen
was
her
suitor
but
his
nature
was
such
that
he
believed
in
his
own
powers
of
persuasion
to
induce
the
girl
to
transfer
her
affections
to
his
more
desirable
self
but
he
only
looked
thoughtfully
at
burdon
and
said
there
are
matters
here
also
that
require
attention
in
appleby
s
well
burdon
went
on
as
to
the
murder
there
s
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
work
of
one
of
the
three
wheelers
nobody
else
had
any
reason
to
wish
old
appleby
out
of
the
you
forget
me
said
allen
in
a
tense
voice
my
interests
are
one
with
the
wheelers
if
they
had
such
a
motive
as
you
ascribe
to
had
the
don
t
waste
time
in
such
talk
said
curt
keefe
i
saw
you
allen
at
the
fire
during
the
whole
time
that
covered
the
opportunity
for
the
of
course
agreed
burdon
i
ve
looked
into
all
that
and
so
as
i
say
it
must
have
been
one
member
of
the
wheeler
family
for
there
s
no
one
else
to
including
wheeler
quietly
put
in
hallen
how
absurd
flared
out
allen
it
s
bad
enough
to
suspect
the
other
two
but
to
think
of
wheeler
is
ridiculous
not
at
all
said
burdon
she
had
the
same
had
how
do
you
know
asked
keefe
she
ran
down
from
her
room
at
that
very
moment
stated
burdon
i
have
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
upstairs
maids
and
also
i
believe
miss
wheeler
saw
her
mother
in
the
look
here
said
hallen
in
his
slow
drawling
tones
let
s
reconstruct
the
situation
you
two
men
were
at
the
much
is
you
can
t
be
suspected
but
all
three
of
the
wheelers
had
absolute
opportunity
and
they
had
motive
now
as
i
look
at
of
those
three
was
the
criminal
and
the
other
two
saw
the
deed
wherefore
the
two
onlookers
will
do
all
they
can
to
shield
the
keefe
stared
at
him
you
really
believe
that
he
said
sure
i
do
nobody
else
had
either
motive
or
opportunity
i
don
t
for
one
minute
believe
in
an
outsider
who
could
happen
along
at
that
particular
moment
get
away
with
the
shooting
and
then
get
away
himself
why
it
could
have
been
done
mused
keefe
and
allen
broke
in
eagerly
of
course
it
could
there
s
nothing
to
prove
it
you
two
say
that
because
you
want
it
to
be
that
way
said
burdon
smiling
at
the
two
young
men
that
s
all
re
both
friends
of
the
family
and
can
t
bear
to
suspect
any
one
of
them
but
facts
remain
now
let
s
see
which
of
the
three
it
most
likely
the
old
man
declared
hallen
promptly
nonsense
cried
allen
mr
wheeler
is
incapable
of
a
deed
like
that
why
i
ve
known
him
for
don
t
talk
about
incapable
of
anything
said
burdon
most
murderers
are
people
whom
their
friends
consider
incapable
of
such
a
a
man
who
is
generally
adjudged
capable
of
it
is
not
found
in
polite
where
s
the
weapon
asked
keefe
abruptly
if
wheeler
did
it
where
s
the
weapon
whoever
did
it
countered
burdon
the
weapon
hasn
t
been
found
though
i
ve
hunted
hard
but
that
helps
to
prove
it
one
of
the
family
for
they
would
know
where
to
hide
a
revolver
if
it
was
wheeler
he
d
have
to
hide
it
in
the
den
said
allen
he
never
goes
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
you
it
isn
t
in
the
den
hallen
spoke
positively
i
hunted
that
you
seem
sure
of
your
statement
said
keefe
couldn
t
you
have
overlooked
it
positively
no
he
couldn
t
concurred
burdon
hallen
s
a
wonderful
hunter
if
that
revolver
had
been
hidden
in
the
den
he
d
have
found
it
that
s
why
i
think
it
was
wheeler
and
she
took
it
back
to
her
own
oh
not
wheeler
groaned
jeff
allen
that
dear
sweet
woman
couldn
incapable
of
murder
i
s
pose
ironically
said
burdon
let
me
tell
you
sir
many
a
time
a
dear
sweet
woman
has
done
extraordinary
things
for
the
sake
of
her
husband
or
but
what
motive
would
wheeler
have
the
same
as
the
others
appleby
was
a
thorn
in
their
flesh
an
enemy
of
many
years
standing
and
i
ve
heard
hints
of
another
reason
for
the
family
s
hating
him
besides
that
conditional
pardon
business
but
no
matter
about
that
now
what
i
want
is
evidence
against
one
of
three
suspects
until
i
get
some
definite
evidence
i
can
t
tell
which
of
the
three
is
most
likely
the
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
wheeler
ran
downstairs
and
back
again
is
enough
to
indicate
some
pretty
close
questioning
of
her
suggested
hallen
oh
please
begged
allen
she
s
upset
and
of
course
she
is
but
that
s
the
reason
we
must
ask
her
about
it
now
when
she
gets
calmed
down
and
gets
a
fine
yarn
concocted
there
ll
be
small
use
asking
her
anything
i
d
tackle
the
old
man
first
said
hallen
i
think
on
general
principles
he
s
the
one
to
make
inquiries
of
before
you
go
to
the
ladies
let
s
go
to
him
no
proposed
burdon
let
s
send
for
him
to
come
here
this
is
away
from
the
house
and
we
can
talk
more
i
ll
go
for
him
offered
allen
seeing
they
were
determined
to
carry
out
their
plan
not
much
said
burdon
you
re
just
aching
to
put
a
flea
in
his
ear
you
go
for
him
the
detective
went
to
the
house
and
returned
with
daniel
wheeler
at
his
side
the
suspected
man
stood
straight
and
held
himself
fearlessly
not
an
old
man
he
was
grayed
with
care
and
trouble
but
this
morning
he
seemed
strong
and
alert
as
any
of
them
put
your
questions
he
said
briefly
as
he
seated
himself
on
one
of
the
many
seats
beneath
the
old
sycamore
first
of
all
who
do
you
think
killed
samuel
appleby
this
question
was
shot
at
him
by
burdon
and
all
waited
in
silence
for
the
answer
i
killed
him
myself
was
the
straightforward
reply
that
settles
it
said
hallen
it
was
one
of
the
what
do
you
mean
by
that
cried
wheeler
turning
quickly
toward
the
speaker
i
mean
that
either
your
wife
or
daughter
did
the
deed
and
you
are
taking
the
crime
on
yourself
to
save
no
reasserted
dan
wheeler
you
re
wrong
i
killed
appleby
for
good
and
sufficient
reason
i
m
not
sorry
and
i
accept
my
wait
a
minute
said
hallen
as
keefe
was
about
to
protest
where
was
your
daughter
miss
maida
when
you
killed
your
man
don
t
know
i
think
she
had
gone
to
the
had
just
broken
you
re
not
i
am
she
had
been
with
you
in
the
den
i
don
t
well
i
know
she
had
she
had
been
sitting
in
her
favorite
in
the
large
bay
and
was
there
while
you
and
appleby
were
talking
together
also
she
did
not
leave
the
room
to
go
to
the
fire
for
no
one
saw
her
anywhere
near
the
burning
as
to
that
i
can
t
say
went
on
wheeler
slowly
but
she
was
not
in
the
den
to
my
knowledge
at
the
time
of
the
very
well
let
that
pass
now
then
wheeler
if
you
shot
appleby
what
did
you
afterward
do
with
your
revolver
don
t
the
man
s
face
was
convincing
his
frank
eyes
testified
to
the
truth
of
his
words
i
assure
you
i
don
t
know
i
was
i
must
have
dropped
i
never
thought
of
it
but
if
you
had
merely
dropped
it
it
must
have
been
found
and
it
hasn
t
somebody
else
found
it
and
secreted
it
suggested
hallen
probably
wheeler
s
wife
or
perhaps
so
assented
wheeler
calmly
they
might
have
thought
to
help
me
by
secreting
it
have
you
asked
them
yes
and
they
deny
all
knowledge
of
so
do
i
but
surely
it
will
be
it
must
be
found
and
therefore
it
is
imperative
that
the
rooms
of
the
ladies
as
well
as
your
own
rooms
sir
be
thoroughly
all
ahead
and
search
wheeler
spoke
sharply
i
ve
confessed
the
crime
now
waste
no
time
in
useless
chattering
get
the
evidence
get
the
proofs
and
let
the
law
take
its
you
will
not
leave
the
premises
put
in
hallen
and
his
tone
was
that
of
command
rather
than
inquiry
i
most
certainly
shall
not
declared
wheeler
but
i
do
ask
you
gentlemen
to
trouble
and
annoy
my
wife
and
daughter
as
little
as
possible
their
grief
is
sufficient
reason
for
their
being
let
h
m
grunted
burdon
well
sir
i
can
promise
not
to
trouble
the
ladies
more
than
is
i
can
t
help
feeling
necessity
will
demand
a
great
wheeler
was
next
interviewed
and
the
confab
took
place
in
her
own
none
of
her
family
was
allowed
to
be
present
and
the
four
men
filed
into
the
room
with
various
expressions
of
face
the
two
detectives
were
but
eagerly
determined
to
do
their
work
while
allen
and
keefe
were
alertly
interested
in
finding
out
some
way
to
be
of
help
to
wheeler
she
received
the
men
quietly
even
graciously
sensing
what
they
had
come
for
to
start
with
wheeler
said
burdon
frankly
but
not
unkindly
who
do
you
think
killed
appleby
don
t
don
t
know
she
wailed
losing
her
calm
and
becoming
greatly
agitated
where
were
you
when
the
shot
was
fired
asked
hallen
i
don
t
didn
t
hear
then
you
were
up
in
your
own
room
i
suppose
don
t
you
were
up
there
when
the
fire
broke
out
think
i
but
you
must
know
is
you
must
know
where
you
were
when
you
first
heard
of
the
yes
yes
i
was
up
in
my
and
who
told
you
of
the
fire
my
and
then
what
did
you
do
don
t
you
ran
downstairs
didn
t
you
i
don
t
yes
you
did
burdon
took
up
the
reins
you
ran
downstairs
and
just
as
you
got
down
to
the
den
you
saw
your
husband
shoot
appleby
his
harsh
manner
as
he
intended
frightened
the
nervous
woman
and
reduced
her
to
the
verge
of
collapse
but
after
a
gasping
moment
she
recovered
herself
and
cried
out
i
did
not
i
shot
appleby
myself
that
s
why
i
m
so
i
knew
it
exclaimed
burdon
mr
wheeler
s
confession
was
merely
to
save
his
wife
now
wheeler
i
believe
your
story
and
i
want
all
the
particulars
first
why
did
you
kill
him
he
was
my
husband
s
i
had
stood
it
as
long
as
i
h
m
and
what
did
you
do
with
the
weapon
you
used
i
threw
it
out
of
the
and
it
dropped
on
the
lawn
not
dropped
i
threw
it
far
far
as
i
oh
i
see
out
of
which
window
the
one
in
the
bay
but
your
sitting
in
the
bay
no
she
was
not
wheeler
spoke
emphatically
now
she
was
not
in
the
room
at
all
she
had
gone
to
the
oh
is
that
so
and
happened
next
ran
upstairs
appalled
at
what
you
had
done
not
much
unnerved
yes
unnerved
i
fell
on
my
bed
and
rachel
looked
after
ah
yes
we
will
interview
rachel
and
so
save
you
further
harrowing
details
come
on
men
let
s
strike
while
these
irons
are
the
four
filed
from
the
room
and
burdon
spoke
in
a
low
tone
but
excitedly
come
quickly
there
goes
miss
maida
across
the
lawn
we
will
take
her
next
the
maid
rachel
can
inwardly
rebelling
but
urged
on
by
the
others
jeff
allen
went
along
and
as
burdon
stopped
maida
on
her
quick
walk
across
the
lawn
jeff
put
his
arm
through
that
of
the
girl
and
said
do
as
they
tell
you
dear
it
s
best
to
have
this
matter
settled
at
again
the
party
grouped
themselves
under
the
old
sycamore
and
this
time
maida
was
the
target
for
their
queries
tell
me
all
you
know
of
the
case
she
said
peremptorily
then
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
we
know
that
the
murder
was
committed
by
one
of
you
three
wheelers
said
burdon
brutally
now
both
your
parents
have
confessed
to
being
the
what
maida
cried
her
face
white
and
her
eyes
big
and
frightened
yes

just
that
now
what
have
you
to
say

you
going
to
confess

of
course
i
am

am
the
real
criminal
can
t
you
see
that
my
father
and
mother
are
both
trying
to
shield
me

did
it
because
of
that
awful
man

my
father

my
confession
and
do
with
me
what
you
will

state
of
things
cried
burdon
truly
surprised
at
this
new
development
the
girl
is
telling
the
truth
exclaimed
curtis
keefe
not
because
he
really
thought
so
but
his
quick
mind
told
him
that
it
would
be
easier
to
get
a
young
girl
acquitted
than
an
older
person
and
he
saw
the
plausibility
of
the
detectives
theory
that
it
must
have
been
one
of
the
three
wheelers
all
right
burdon
went
on
then
miss
wheeler
enlighten
us
as
to
details
where
s
the
weapon
i
don
t
have
to
tell
you
anything
except
that
i
did
it
do
i
jeffrey
do
i
keefe
she
looked
at
these
two
for
help
no
miss
wheeler
keefe
assured
her
you
needn
t
say
a
word
without
legal
but
maida
jeffrey
groaned
you
didn
t
do
know
you
couldn
t
have
yes
i
did
maida
s
eyes
were
glittering
and
her
voice
was
steady
of
course
i
did
i
d
do
anything
to
save
father
from
any
more
persecution
by
that
man
and
there
was
to
be
more
oh
don
t
let
me
talk
i
mustn
t
no
you
mustn
t
agreed
keefe
now
burdon
you
ve
got
three
confessions
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
going
to
find
out
which
is
the
true
one
answered
burdon
with
a
dogged
expression
i
knew
all
the
time
it
was
one
of
the
three
and
i
m
not
surprised
that
the
other
two
are
willing
to
perjure
themselves
to
save
the
also
there
may
have
been
collusion
suggested
hallen
of
course
the
other
agreed
but
we
ll
find
out
the
whole
thing
rests
among
the
three
they
must
not
be
allowed
to
i
ve
no
intention
of
running
away
said
maida
proudly
no
one
will
run
away
opined
hallen
sagaciously
the
criminal
will
stand
by
the
other
two
and
the
other
two
will
stand
by
or
her
as
the
case
may
be
supplemented
burdon
her
maida
assured
him
in
the
first
place
my
mother
was
upstairs
in
her
own
room
and
my
father
was
not
in
the
den
at
the
time
i
was
there
oh
yes
your
father
was
in
the
den
cried
jeffrey
imploringly
no
said
maida
not
catching
his
meaning
but
hallen
caught
it
where
was
wheeler
he
asked
don
t
know
maida
said
well
if
he
wasn
t
in
the
den
and
if
he
wasn
t
upstairs
maybe
he
was
in
the
big
looking
out
at
the
i
think
he
was
maida
agreed
then
hallen
went
on
then
wheeler
broke
his
is
due
for
oh
no
maida
moaned
seeing
where
her
statements
had
led
guess
he
was
in
the
and
i
guess
you
re
making
up
as
you
go
along
opined
hallen
chapter
ix
before
keefe
went
away
young
allen
had
a
serious
talk
with
him
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
allen
said
shall
i
confess
to
that
crime
man
alive
what
are
you
talking
about
keefe
cried
astounded
at
the
suggestion
talking
sense
jeffrey
stoutly
asserted
i
don
t
believe
any
one
of
those
three
did
re
saying
they
did
to
shield
one
and
so
you
want
to
get
into
the
game
keefe
smiled
at
him
you
re
very
young
my
boy
to
think
such
crude
methods
would
get
over
even
with
such
muffs
as
those
two
booby
sleuths
no
allen
don
t
add
another
perjury
that
can
be
of
no
possible
use
you
didn
t
do
the
killing
did
you
of
course
not
but
neither
did
the
wheelers
no
one
of
them
certainly
who
did
then
i
don
t
know
but
you
yourself
insisted
on
some
only
to
get
suspicion
away
from
the
family
but
there
s
no
hope
of
finding
any
evidence
of
an
outside
job
you
see
i
ve
made
some
inquiries
myself
and
the
servants
tales
make
it
pretty
sure
that
no
intruder
could
have
been
here
so
the
wheelers
are
the
only
suspects
and
am
i
not
as
good
for
a
suspect
as
they
i
make
due
confession
no
allen
you
re
not
you
re
in
love
with
miss
i
m
engaged
to
her
all
right
don
t
you
see
then
the
absurdity
of
expecting
any
one
to
believe
that
you
a
decent
young
citizen
would
commit
a
murder
which
would
positively
render
impossible
a
marriage
with
the
girl
you
love
i
didn
t
think
of
that
of
course
you
didn
t
but
that
would
make
it
unlikely
that
those
detectives
would
believe
your
tale
for
a
moment
no
it
s
ridiculous
for
any
more
people
to
confess
to
this
murder
three
avowed
criminals
are
quite
enough
for
the
crime
but
none
of
them
really
did
how
you
harp
on
that
string
now
look
here
allen
i
m
as
loath
to
believe
it
as
you
are
but
we
must
face
facts
those
three
people
had
motive
and
opportunity
moreover
they
re
a
most
united
family
and
if
any
one
thought
either
of
the
other
two
guilty
that
one
is
quite
capable
of
falsely
avowing
the
see
that
spoke
impatiently
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
we
re
going
to
do
about
it
there
i
can
t
advise
you
i
have
to
get
away
now
but
as
i
said
i
ll
return
i
ve
more
than
a
little
taste
for
investigation
myself
and
when
i
come
back
i
ve
no
doubt
i
can
don
t
want
you
to
it
s
going
to
prove
anything
on
any
of
the
but
you
believe
them
innocent
yes
but
crime
has
been
fastened
on
the
look
here
allen
you
do
believe
them
you
fear
your
belief
is
a
mistaken
one
god
help
me
i
do
fear
that
keefe
oh
what
can
we
do
it
s
a
bad
lookout
all
i
can
say
now
is
to
preserve
a
demeanor
and
keep
things
stationary
as
much
as
you
can
maybe
when
i
come
back
we
at
least
muddle
things
complicate
the
evidence
so
that
it
won
t
be
careful
now
you
know
what
compounding
a
felony
means
don
t
you
oh
allen
you
re
so
young
and
impulsive
and
the
wheelers
are
so
emotional
and
indiscreet
i
wonder
what
will
happen
before
i
get
back
somebody
ought
to
be
in
charge
yes
some
good
lawyer
or
some
person
who
would
hold
back
those
fool
detectives
and
look
out
for
the
interests
of
the
i
wish
you
could
i
wish
so
too
but
i
ll
do
all
i
can
to
return
quickly
and
wheeler
ought
to
be
able
to
look
after
his
own
affairs
i
know
he
ought
he
isn
t
also
i
ought
to
but
i
m
not
yes
you
are
jeffrey
cried
maida
who
had
happened
along
in
time
to
hear
the
young
man
s
depreciation
of
himself
hello
maida
he
turned
to
her
what
did
you
mean
by
making
up
that
string
of
falsehoods
don
t
talk
about
it
jeff
and
the
girl
s
face
went
white
if
you
do
i
shall
go
mad
i
don
t
wonder
miss
wheeler
said
keefe
sympathetically
now
as
i
ve
just
told
allen
i
m
coming
back
as
soon
as
i
can
make
it
and
until
i
do
won
t
you
try
to
hold
off
those
men
don
t
let
them
pound
you
and
your
parents
into
admissions
better
left
unmade
i
m
not
asking
you
any
questions
i
ve
no
right
to
but
i
beg
of
you
to
keep
your
own
counsel
if
you
are
shielding
someone
say
as
little
as
possible
if
you
are
guilty
yourself
say
guilty
herself
you
ve
no
right
to
say
such
a
thing
allen
cried
out
of
course
i
have
keefe
returned
when
i
heard
miss
wheeler
avow
the
crime
but
i
must
go
now
here
s
the
car
both
of
you
wheeler
if
i
may
advise
don
t
confide
too
the
last
words
were
spoken
in
an
aside
and
if
allen
heard
them
he
gave
no
sign
he
bade
keefe
with
a
preoccupied
air
and
as
others
joined
them
then
he
waited
till
the
car
started
and
then
took
maida
s
arm
and
led
her
away
toward
the
garden
miss
lane
of
course
went
with
keefe
and
as
the
girls
parted
maida
had
suddenly
felt
a
sense
of
loneliness
i
liked
genevieve
a
lot
she
said
to
allen
as
they
walked
away
i
didn
t
he
returned
oh
jeff
you
are
so
quick
to
take
prejudices
against
people
i
don
t
mean
i
m
specially
fond
of
genevieve
but
she
was
kind
to
me
and
now
i
do
seem
so
alone
maida
when
you
have
your
parents
and
me
what
do
you
mean
i
can
t
tell
you
exactly
but
i
seem
to
want
with
wide
experience
and
educated
whom
i
can
go
for
won
t
i
do
dear
you
re
kind
enough
and
loving
jeff
you
don
t
know
things
i
mean
you
haven
t
had
experience
criminal
come
on
maida
let
s
have
it
out
what
about
this
criminal
case
of
ours
for
it
s
mine
as
much
as
it
s
oh
no
it
isn
t
jeff
you
ve
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
must
bear
my
burden
must
ask
you
to
release
me
from
our
which
i
will
never
do
how
absurd
now
maida
mine
if
you
won
t
speak
out
i
must
i
know
perfectly
well
you
never
killed
appleby
i
know
too
that
you
saw
either
your
father
or
mother
kill
him
and
you
re
trying
to
shield
the
criminal
very
right
too
except
that
you
mustn
t
keep
the
truth
from
me
how
can
i
help
you
dear
unless
i
know
what
you
re
trying
to
do
so
tell
me
the
i
can
t
tell
you
more
than
i
have
jeff
maida
spoke
with
a
sigh
you
must
believe
me
and
as
murderer
i
never
of
course
shall
maida
you
re
a
transparent
little
prevaricator
don
t
think
i
don
t
realize
the
awful
situation
for
i
do
but
i
can
won
t
let
you
sacrifice
yourself
for
either
of
your
parents
i
don
t
ask
you
which
one
it
fact
i
d
rather
you
wouldn
t
tell
i
do
ask
you
to
believe
that
i
know
it
wasn
t
you
now
drop
that
jeffrey
and
maida
spoke
very
solemnly
don
t
you
believe
that
i
could
kill
a
man
if
he
was
so
cruel
so
dangerous
to
my
dear
father
that
i
couldn
t
stand
it
another
minute
don
t
you
believe
i
d
be
capable
of
killing
him
we
ve
spoken
of
that
before
maida
and
i
think
i
said
i
believed
you
would
be
capable
in
a
moment
of
sudden
intense
anger
and
well
then
why
do
you
doubt
my
word
i
told
the
tell
you
that
the
moment
saw
my
father
under
stress
of
terrible
immediate
desperate
danger
from
samuel
appleby
the
girl
broke
down
and
jeffrey
took
the
slender
quivering
form
in
his
arms
all
right
sweetheart
he
whispered
don
t
say
another
understand
i
don
t
blame
could
you
think
i
would
i
just
want
to
help
you
how
can
i
best
do
that
but
maida
could
not
tell
him
her
tears
once
started
came
in
torrents
her
whole
frame
shook
with
the
intensity
of
her
sobs
and
unable
to
control
herself
at
all
she
ran
from
him
into
the
house
and
up
to
her
own
room
what
did
you
find
out
burdon
asked
coming
out
from
behind
a
nearby
clump
of
shrubbery
you
sneak
you
cad
allen
cried
but
the
detective
stopped
him
now
look
here
allen
he
said
we
re
here
to
do
our
duty
said
duty
being
to
discover
the
perpetrator
of
a
pretty
awful
crime
you
may
be
so
minded
as
to
let
the
murderer
go
even
help
him
or
her
to
make
a
getaway
but
i
can
t
indulge
in
any
such
philanthropic
scheme
appleby
s
been
foully
murdered
and
it
s
up
to
the
law
to
find
out
the
killer
and
see
justice
done
my
job
is
not
a
pleasant
one
but
i
ve
got
to
see
it
through
and
that
s
all
there
is
about
that
now
this
case
is
what
we
call
the
murderer
is
sure
and
positively
one
of
three
three
people
being
known
to
us
so
i
ve
just
got
to
use
all
my
powers
to
discover
which
of
the
three
i
m
really
after
and
when
i
find
that
out
then
make
my
arrest
but
i
ve
no
desire
to
nab
the
wrong
which
one
do
you
think
it
is
demanded
allen
angrily
i
ve
got
no
right
nor
reason
to
it
s
either
one
i
ve
got
to
find
out
for
sure
not
just
think
it
so
i
ask
you
what
you
learned
just
now
from
miss
wheeler
and
why
did
she
run
to
the
house
weeping
like
a
willow
tree
i
found
out
nothing
that
would
throw
any
light
on
your
quest
and
she
wept
because
her
nerves
are
strained
to
the
breaking
point
with
worry
and
and
i
don
t
wonder
the
detective
spoke
sympathetically
but
all
the
same
i
m
obliged
to
keep
on
investigating
and
i
must
ask
you
what
she
said
to
you
just
allen
thought
over
the
conversation
he
had
had
with
maida
then
he
said
i
am
telling
the
truth
when
i
say
there
was
no
word
said
between
us
that
would
be
of
any
real
use
to
you
miss
wheeler
is
my
and
i
tried
to
comfort
her
and
also
to
assure
her
anew
of
my
faithfulness
and
devotion
in
her
and
what
did
she
say
without
remembering
her
words
exactly
i
think
i
can
state
that
she
said
nothing
more
than
to
reiterate
that
she
had
killed
appleby
but
i
want
to
state
also
that
i
believe
she
said
it
as
she
said
it
to
you
to
shield
some
one
her
one
of
them
that
is
the
reasonable
supposition
but
i
do
not
accuse
either
of
the
elder
wheelers
i
still
suspect
an
intruder
from
of
course
you
do
anybody
in
your
position
would
but
there
was
none
such
it
was
one
of
the
three
wheelers
and
i
ll
proceed
to
find
out
which
just
how
do
you
propose
to
find
out
well
the
one
that
did
it
is
very
likely
to
give
it
away
it
s
mighty
difficult
to
be
on
your
guard
every
minute
and
with
one
guilty
and
two
shielding
and
all
three
knowing
which
is
which
as
i
ve
no
doubt
they
do
why
it
s
a
cinch
that
one
of
the
three
breaks
down
through
sheer
overcarefulness
pretty
that
s
true
enough
allen
agreed
ruefully
is
that
your
only
plan
yes
except
to
look
up
the
weapon
it
s
a
great
help
always
to
find
the
hoping
to
find
the
criminal
s
initials
on
it
well
no
they
don
t
mark
firearms
in
real
life
as
they
do
in
but
to
find
the
weapon
gives
a
lot
of
evidence
as
to
where
it
was
fired
from
and
what
was
done
with
it
afterward
and
to
whom
it
belongs
not
that
the
owner
is
always
the
murderer
more
often
the
reverse
is
true
but
the
weapon
we
want
and
want
pretty
badly
by
the
way
i
m
told
that
young
appleby
is
out
of
the
running
for
governor
now
that
his
father
isn
t
here
to
help
him
more
i
take
it
because
of
his
grief
for
his
father
s
untimely
be
that
as
it
may
he
ll
withdraw
his
name
from
the
who
told
you
i
heard
keefe
telling
miss
you
hear
a
lot
i
do
allen
it
s
my
business
to
do
so
now
here
s
another
thing
about
that
garage
well
what
about
it
it
was
a
mighty
mysterious
fire
that
s
all
nobody
knows
how
it
started
or
they
must
know
where
not
exactly
it
seemed
to
start
in
the
vicinity
of
appleby
s
own
car
but
there
was
nothing
inflammable
around
that
part
of
the
well
what
does
that
prove
or
indicate
anything
prejudicial
to
the
wheelers
not
so
far
as
i
can
see
only
it
s
queer
that
s
perhaps
appleby
kept
tobacco
and
matches
in
his
perhaps
so
anyway
that
s
where
the
fire
originated
and
also
about
where
it
stopped
they
soon
put
it
glad
they
did
i
can
t
see
that
the
fire
has
any
bearing
whatever
on
the
neither
can
i
allen
but
hallen
now
he
thinks
it
just
how
i
can
t
say
hallen
doesn
t
know
himself
but
he
says
there
s
a
there
may
be
but
unless
it
s
a
connection
that
will
free
the
wheelers
from
suspicion
it
doesn
t
interest
allen
left
the
detective
who
made
no
effort
to
detain
him
and
went
to
the
den
for
a
talk
with
wheeler
but
that
gentleman
locked
in
the
room
declared
through
the
closed
door
that
he
would
see
nobody
sorry
jeff
he
said
in
a
kindly
tone
but
you
must
excuse
me
at
present
give
me
the
day
to
myself
i
ll
see
you
late
this
as
it
was
already
noon
allen
made
no
further
attempt
at
an
interview
and
went
in
search
of
wheeler
it
seemed
to
him
he
must
talk
to
some
of
the
family
and
he
hadn
t
the
heart
to
disturb
maida
who
might
be
resting
wheeler
s
maid
said
that
her
mistress
would
see
him
in
a
few
minutes
and
it
was
only
a
few
minutes
later
that
the
lady
came
downstairs
and
greeted
allen
who
awaited
her
in
the
what
are
we
going
to
do
she
exclaimed
to
him
do
help
us
jeff
did
i
do
right
in
lying
to
save
some
one
you
love
yes
i
suppose
but
sara
wheeler
had
very
acute
hearing
even
as
they
spoke
she
heard
a
slight
movement
on
the
porch
outside
and
realized
at
once
that
a
detective
was
listening
to
her
every
word
allen
couldn
t
be
sure
whether
this
changed
her
mental
attitude
or
whether
she
continued
as
she
had
meant
to
when
she
began
but
she
said
oh
i
don
t
mean
that
i
mean
did
i
do
right
to
confess
my
crime
at
once
you
know
they
would
discover
it
sooner
or
later
and
i
thought
it
would
save
time
and
trouble
for
me
to
own
up
dear
wheeler
don
t
quibble
with
me
i
know
you
didn
t
do
oh
yes
i
did
jeff
who
else
could
it
have
been
and
too
you
know
about
the
bugler
don
t
you
well
that
s
what
made
me
do
it
you
see
i
thought
if
a
death
occurred
that
would
be
the
death
the
bugler
was
heralding
and
if
it
wasn
t
appleby
it
might
have
been
dan
she
leaned
forward
as
she
spoke
her
voice
dropped
to
a
mere
whisper
and
her
large
eyes
took
on
a
glassy
stare
while
her
white
face
was
drawn
and
set
with
an
agonized
expression
as
of
a
dreadful
memory
and
you
killed
appleby
for
that
reason
cried
allen
oh
killed
him
mind
seemed
to
oh
yes
she
resumed
because
he
was
a
menace
to
dan
to
my
for
the
first
time
allen
began
to
doubt
her
sanity
her
eyes
were
wild
her
fingers
nervously
interlaced
and
her
speech
was
jerky
and
stammering
a
menace
how
he
asked
softly
in
different
ways
wheeler
returned
in
so
low
a
voice
that
the
listener
outside
could
scarcely
hear
through
me
because
of
something
he
knew
through
something
he
wanted
and
of
course
through
dan
himself
because
of
that
old
conditional
what
do
you
mean
about
maida
allen
caught
at
the
thing
that
most
impressed
him
did
old
appleby
want
to
marry
maida
yes
he
did
of
course
neither
her
father
nor
i
would
hear
of
such
a
thing
but
appleby
was
an
insistent
and
he
wanted
mother
dear
i
want
you
to
come
away
now
and
maida
came
into
the
room
come
you
have
talked
too
long
it
does
no
good
to
you
or
to
any
one
else
did
you
call
her
down
jeffrey
yes
and
allen
deeply
regretted
his
act
but
i
want
to
talk
to
somebody
maida
will
you
take
your
mother
return
yes
i
will
and
the
girl
left
the
room
guiding
the
slow
footsteps
of
her
mother
when
she
came
back
allen
took
her
out
under
the
old
sycamore
now
maida
he
said
gently
the
truth
no
matter
what
it
is
you
must
tell
me
we
are
here
alone
that
eavesdropping
detective
can
t
overhear
us
and
you
must
tell
me
whom
you
are
shielding
and
the
full
details
for
the
i
can
t
tell
you
all
the
details
jeff
the
girl
returned
they
include
a
secret
that
is
not
mine
to
you
can
divulge
anything
in
a
crisis
like
this
no
i
can
not
before
he
died
appleby
told
me
something
that
i
will
never
tell
unless
my
conscience
makes
me
do
isn
t
it
a
matter
of
conscience
already
i
don
t
know
jeff
truly
i
can
t
tell
but
much
as
i
am
bound
by
my
principles
of
right
and
you
know
dear
i
conscientious
i
would
willingly
throw
them
all
to
the
winds
if
they
interfered
with
my
parents
happiness
or
let
me
get
this
straight
maida
you
would
stifle
your
conscience
would
act
directly
against
its
dictates
for
the
sake
of
your
parents
yes
jeffrey
right
or
wrong
that
s
what
i
should
who
am
i
that
i
should
judge
you
dear
i
know
well
your
lifelong
submission
to
your
conscience
even
when
your
inclinations
were
strong
the
other
way
now
if
you
have
thrown
over
principle
honor
conscience
and
right
for
what
you
consider
a
stronger
motive
i
can
only
accept
your
decision
but
i
wish
you
would
confide
in
me
more
fully
do
you
mean
in
regard
to
appleby
of
course
i
mean
in
regard
to
appleby
and
i
m
going
to
ask
you
jeff
to
believe
what
i
tell
of
course
i
ll
do
that
no
you
won
t
want
to
but
i
ask
you
to
believe
it
implicitly
and
to
act
accordingly
do
you
promise
me
this
the
girl
s
face
was
turned
to
his
her
great
sorrowful
eyes
were
full
of
dumb
agony
and
showed
unshed
tears
but
her
voice
was
clear
and
strong
as
of
one
whose
purpose
was
unshakable
yes
dear
and
jeffrey
took
her
hands
in
his
and
looked
deep
into
her
eyes
whose
blank
despair
haunted
him
long
after
yes
maida
i
well
then
i
killed
appleby
and
you
must
do
whatever
you
think
best
for
us
all
what
shall
we
do
first
jeffrey
and
with
the
clutch
of
an
icy
dread
at
his
heart
allen
replied
brokenly
i
don
t
know
maida
darling
but
i
will
find
out
what
is
best
and
we
will
do
chapter
x
the
phantom
bugler
the
day
after
the
funeral
of
samuel
appleby
keefe
returned
to
sycamore
ridge
i
came
wheeler
he
said
to
offer
you
my
services
i
express
no
opinion
as
to
who
killed
appleby
but
i
do
know
that
his
son
is
going
to
use
every
means
to
discover
his
father
s
murderer
and
i
can
t
help
thinking
you
d
be
wise
to
let
me
take
up
your
as
a
criminal
lawyer
asked
dan
wheeler
quietly
no
sir
as
a
friend
and
adviser
if
you
find
you
need
a
criminal
lawyer
i
ll
suggest
a
good
one
but
i
mean
i
d
like
to
help
you
in
a
general
way
by
consultation
and
advice
you
if
you
will
pardon
me
have
lived
so
long
out
of
the
modern
world
that
you
are
unfitted
to
cope
with
this
whole
situation
i
speak
i
am
deeply
just
why
are
you
so
deeply
interested
keefe
wheeler
s
tone
was
kindly
but
his
glance
was
sharp
at
his
benefactor
i
may
as
well
own
up
keefe
said
i
am
hard
hit
by
your
daughter
oh
yes
i
know
she
is
engaged
to
young
allen
and
i
ve
no
hope
she
would
ever
throw
him
over
for
me
but
i
m
anxious
to
serve
her
in
any
way
i
i
feel
pretty
sure
that
i
can
be
of
help
to
you
and
your
well
spoken
young
man
and
your
promises
are
right
i
am
out
of
touch
with
the
world
and
i
should
be
glad
indeed
of
the
advice
of
an
experienced
man
of
business
but
first
of
all
will
you
tell
me
who
think
killed
appleby
i
will
sir
i
ve
no
idea
it
was
any
of
you
three
people
who
have
all
confessed
to
the
deed
in
order
to
shield
one
whom
then
do
you
suspect
an
outside
intruder
i
have
held
to
this
theory
from
the
start
and
i
am
sure
it
is
the
true
one
moreover
i
think
the
murderer
is
the
man
who
blew
the
the
phantom
bugler
no
phantom
but
a
live
man
phantoms
do
not
blow
on
bugles
except
in
old
english
legends
a
bugle
sounded
in
new
england
and
heard
by
several
people
was
blown
by
human
lungs
find
your
bugler
and
you
ve
found
your
i
wonder
if
you
can
be
right
wheeler
fell
into
a
brown
study
and
keefe
watched
him
closely
his
bugler
theory
was
offered
in
an
effort
to
find
out
what
wheeler
thought
of
it
and
wheeler
s
response
ought
to
show
whether
his
own
knowledge
of
the
murder
precluded
the
bugler
or
not
apparently
it
did
for
he
sighed
and
said
of
course
the
person
who
sounded
that
bugle
was
a
live
person
but
i
can
not
think
it
had
any
connection
with
appleby
s
death
even
granting
somebody
might
have
been
wicked
enough
to
try
to
frighten
my
wife
yet
there
is
no
reason
to
think
any
one
wishing
to
kill
samuel
appleby
would
know
of
the
old
legend
in
wheeler
s
true
enough
but
it
is
possible
and
in
my
opinion
that
is
the
only
direction
to
but
what
direction
how
can
you
find
out
who
blew
that
bugle
i
don
t
know
yet
but
i
shall
try
to
find
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
very
little
inquiry
has
been
made
those
two
detectives
while
intelligent
enough
don
t
have
a
very
wide
horizon
they
ve
concluded
that
the
assassin
was
named
they
re
only
concerned
to
discover
the
first
name
forgive
my
plain
speaking
but
to
save
yourself
and
the
other
two
we
must
be
yes
don
t
hesitate
to
say
anything
you
think
i
am
in
a
terrible
position
terrible
than
you
can
know
and
while
i
am
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
my
dear
may
be
in
the
two
men
had
been
alone
in
the
den
but
now
were
joined
by
burdon
and
young
allen
glad
to
see
you
back
keefe
burdon
said
usually
we
detectives
don
t
hanker
after
outside
help
but
you
ve
a
good
keen
mind
and
i
notice
you
generally
put
your
finger
on
the
right
all
right
burdon
we
ll
work
together
now
wheeler
i
m
going
to
ask
you
to
leave
there
are
some
details
to
dan
wheeler
was
only
too
glad
to
be
excused
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
went
away
to
his
upstairs
quarters
now
it
s
this
way
keefe
began
i
ve
been
sounding
wheeler
but
i
didn
t
get
any
real
satisfaction
but
here
s
a
point
either
he
did
or
didn
t
kill
appleby
but
in
either
case
he
s
in
what
do
you
mean
asked
allen
why
i
ve
inquired
about
among
the
servants
and
adding
our
own
testimony
i
ve
figured
it
out
that
wheeler
was
either
the
murderer
or
he
was
over
the
line
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
and
in
that
case
has
broken
his
parole
and
is
subject
to
the
how
do
you
prove
that
inquired
burdon
interestedly
by
the
story
of
miss
wheeler
who
says
her
father
was
not
in
the
den
at
all
at
the
time
appleby
was
shot
now
as
we
know
wheeler
ran
downstairs
at
that
time
and
she
too
says
her
husband
was
not
in
the
den
also
she
says
he
was
not
in
the
nor
in
the
hall
this
leaves
only
her
own
from
which
wheeler
could
see
the
fire
and
into
which
he
was
most
likely
to
go
for
that
he
wouldn
t
go
in
that
room
for
any
purpose
declared
allen
not
ordinarily
but
in
the
excitement
of
a
fire
men
can
scarcely
refrain
from
running
to
look
at
it
and
if
he
was
not
in
the
places
he
had
a
right
to
be
he
must
have
been
over
on
the
forbidden
ground
so
it
comes
back
to
this
either
wheeler
was
the
murderer
and
his
wife
and
daughter
have
perjured
themselves
to
save
him
or
he
was
in
a
place
which
by
virtue
of
the
conditions
cancels
his
pardon
this
i
take
it
explains
wheeler
s
present
perturbed
state
of
he
is
bewildered
and
worried
in
many
well
said
allen
where
does
all
this
lead
us
it
leads
us
keefe
returned
to
the
necessity
of
a
lot
of
hard
work
i
m
willing
to
go
on
record
as
desiring
to
find
a
criminal
outside
of
the
wheeler
family
or
to
put
it
bluntly
i
want
to
acquit
all
three
of
even
if
one
of
them
is
guilty
said
burdon
well
that
but
of
course
i
don
t
mean
to
hang
an
innocent
man
what
i
want
is
to
get
a
verdict
for
persons
i
m
with
you
said
allen
it
s
all
wrong
i
know
i
can
t
believe
any
of
the
wheelers
really
did
you
do
believe
it
though
keefe
turned
on
him
sharply
and
what
s
more
you
believe
the
criminal
is
the
one
of
the
three
whom
you
least
want
it
to
be
keefe
s
meaning
was
unmistakable
and
allen
s
flushed
and
crestfallen
face
betrayed
his
unwilling
assent
unable
to
unable
to
speak
he
quickly
left
the
room
keefe
closed
the
door
and
turned
to
burdon
that
was
a
test
he
said
i
m
not
sure
whether
allen
suspects
miss
he
sure
acts
as
if
he
does
burdon
said
his
face
drawn
with
perplexity
but
i
say
keefe
haven
t
you
ever
thought
it
might
have
been
jeffrey
allen
himself
who
did
the
shooting
yes
he
had
all
the
motives
the
others
but
not
opportunity
why
he
was
at
the
garage
i
yes
but
he
might
have
got
away
long
enough
nonsense
man
nothing
of
the
sort
we
were
together
fighting
the
flames
the
two
chauffeurs
were
with
wheelers
man
and
appleby
s
we
used
those
chemical
i
know
all
might
have
slipped
away
and
in
the
excitement
you
didn
t
not
a
chance
no
take
my
word
for
it
the
three
wheelers
are
the
exclusive
we
can
work
in
that
bugler
it
s
too
many
for
me
burdon
sighed
and
hallen
he
s
at
his
wit
s
end
but
you
re
clever
at
such
things
sir
and
appleby
he
s
going
to
get
a
big
detective
from
the
you
don
t
seem
to
mind
being
discarded
no
sir
if
anybody
s
to
fasten
a
crime
on
one
of
those
wheelers
i
don
t
want
to
be
the
one
to
do
look
here
burdon
how
about
wheeler
s
doing
it
in
i
know
a
lot
about
those
two
men
and
appleby
was
just
as
much
interested
in
getting
wheeler
out
of
his
way
as
if
appleby
attacked
and
wheeler
defended
we
can
get
him
off
maybe
so
but
it
s
all
speculation
keefe
what
we
ought
to
get
is
that
s
hard
for
the
only
people
to
ask
about
it
are
the
criminals
the
suspected
there
are
others
have
you
quizzed
all
the
servants
i
don
t
take
much
stock
in
servants
you
re
wrong
there
my
man
that
principle
is
a
good
one
in
ordinary
matters
but
when
it
comes
to
a
murder
case
a
servant
s
testimony
is
as
good
as
his
master
burdon
made
no
direct
response
to
keefe
s
suggestion
but
he
mulled
it
over
in
his
mind
and
as
a
result
he
had
a
talk
with
rachel
who
was
ladies
maid
to
both
maida
and
her
mother
the
girl
bridled
a
little
when
burdon
began
to
question
her
nobody
seemed
to
think
it
worth
while
to
ask
me
anything
she
said
so
i
held
my
tongue
but
if
so
be
you
want
information
you
ask
and
i
ll
i
doubt
if
she
really
knows
anything
burdon
thought
to
himself
judging
from
her
air
of
but
he
said
tell
me
anything
you
know
of
the
circumstances
at
the
time
of
the
circumstances
repeated
rachel
wrinkling
her
brow
yes
for
instance
where
was
wheeler
when
you
heard
the
shot
i
didn
t
say
i
heard
the
didn
t
you
go
on
then
don
t
be
foolish
or
you
ll
be
sorry
for
it
well
then
wheeler
was
had
just
left
her
here
let
me
get
this
story
straight
how
long
had
she
been
in
her
room
were
you
there
with
her
yes
we
had
been
there
half
an
hour
or
so
then
we
heard
noise
and
excitement
and
a
cry
of
fire
wheeler
rushed
out
of
her
room
and
ran
i
followed
yes
and
what
did
you
see
nothing
saw
a
blaze
of
light
through
the
front
the
north
door
of
one
toward
the
i
saw
the
garage
was
on
fire
so
i
thought
of
nothing
then
what
did
you
think
of
later
i
remembered
that
i
saw
wheeler
in
the
the
north
end
of
he
never
you
know
about
his
restrictions
oh
yes
sir
the
servants
all
have
to
well
it
was
natural
poor
man
that
he
should
go
to
look
at
the
fire
you
re
sure
of
this
rachel
sure
yes
but
don
t
let
s
tell
for
it
might
get
the
master
in
on
the
contrary
it
may
get
him
out
of
trouble
to
break
his
parole
is
not
as
serious
a
crime
as
murder
and
if
he
was
in
the
north
end
of
the
he
couldn
t
have
been
in
the
den
shooting
that
s
true
enough
and
neither
could
wheeler
have
done
why
not
was
right
ahead
of
did
you
keep
her
in
sight
no
i
was
so
excited
myself
i
ran
past
her
and
out
to
the
who
was
there
mr
allen
and
keefe
and
the
two
chauffeurs
and
the
head
gardener
and
well
most
all
the
servants
the
men
were
fighting
the
fire
and
the
women
were
standing
back
looking
yelling
i
no
they
were
mostly
quiet
cook
was
screaming
but
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
the
fire
was
soon
over
yes
it
was
a
little
one
i
suppose
that
chauffeur
of
appleby
s
dropped
a
match
or
our
servants
are
too
well
trained
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
we
re
all
afraid
of
well
the
fire
amounted
to
little
as
you
say
curious
it
should
occur
at
the
time
of
the
curious
indeed
sir
do
you
make
anything
out
of
that
can
t
see
anything
in
it
unless
the
murderer
started
the
fire
to
distract
attention
from
himself
in
that
case
it
couldn
t
have
been
any
of
the
that
it
couldn
t
they
were
all
in
the
miss
you
see
her
at
the
time
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
as
i
ran
through
the
where
was
she
in
the
den
standing
near
the
bay
well
we
ve
pretty
well
planted
the
three
wheeler
on
the
stairs
wheeler
you
say
in
the
where
he
had
no
right
to
be
and
miss
oh
miss
maida
didn
t
do
it
she
couldn
t
that
lovely
young
lady
there
rachel
that
will
do
you
ve
given
your
testimony
now
it
s
not
for
you
to
pass
judgment
go
about
your
business
and
keep
a
quiet
tongue
no
understand
yes
sir
and
the
maid
went
away
her
attitude
still
one
of
importance
and
her
face
wearing
a
vague
smile
meantime
curtis
keefe
was
having
a
serious
talk
with
maida
his
attitude
was
kindly
and
deferential
but
he
spoke
with
a
determined
air
as
he
said
miss
wheeler
you
know
i
am
sure
how
much
i
want
to
help
you
and
how
glad
i
will
be
if
i
can
do
so
but
first
of
all
i
must
ask
you
a
question
what
did
appleby
mean
when
he
said
to
you
something
about
keefe
and
the
airship
maida
looked
at
him
with
a
troubled
glance
for
a
minute
she
did
not
speak
then
she
said
calmly
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
tell
you
what
we
were
talking
about
then
keefe
but
don
t
you
remember
appleby
said
that
you
were
not
the
keefe
referred
to
i
know
he
said
that
don
t
believe
i
am
not
responsible
for
your
disbelief
she
drew
herself
up
with
a
dignified
air
and
i
must
ask
you
not
to
refer
to
that
matter
don
t
take
that
attitude
he
begged
at
least
tell
me
what
keefe
he
did
mean
there
can
be
no
breach
of
confidence
in
why
do
you
want
to
know
because
i
know
appleby
had
a
big
airship
project
under
consideration
because
i
know
he
contemplated
letting
me
in
on
the
deal
and
it
was
a
most
profitable
deal
had
he
lived
i
should
have
asked
him
about
it
but
since
he
is
dead
i
admit
i
want
to
know
anything
you
can
tell
me
of
the
involuntarily
maida
smiled
a
little
and
the
lovely
face
usually
so
sad
seemed
more
beautiful
than
ever
to
the
man
who
looked
at
her
why
do
you
smile
he
cried
but
whatever
the
reason
keep
on
doing
so
oh
maida
how
wonderful
you
are
a
glance
of
astonishment
made
him
quickly
apologize
for
his
speech
but
he
said
i
couldn
t
help
it
forgive
me
miss
wheeler
and
since
you
can
smile
over
it
i
m
more
than
ever
anxious
to
know
about
the
airship
and
i
can
tell
you
nothing
she
declared
because
i
know
nothing
of
any
such
matter
if
appleby
was
interested
in
an
airship
project
i
know
nothing
of
it
the
matter
he
mentioned
to
me
was
i
am
positively
certain
not
the
deal
you
speak
i
believe
that
your
face
is
too
honest
for
you
to
speak
an
untruth
so
convincingly
and
now
assure
me
that
i
am
not
the
keefe
he
referred
to
and
i
will
never
open
the
subject
but
this
maida
could
not
say
truthfully
and
though
she
tried
her
assertion
was
belied
by
drooping
eyes
and
quivering
lips
you
were
not
she
uttered
but
she
did
not
look
at
him
and
this
time
curtis
keefe
did
not
believe
her
i
was
he
said
calmly
but
he
made
no
further
effort
to
get
the
whole
truth
from
her
i
m
sorry
you
can
t
confide
fully
in
me
but
i
shall
doubtless
learn
all
i
want
to
know
from
appleby
s
have
them
in
charge
maida
asked
quite
evidently
agitated
at
the
thought
yes
of
course
i
m
his
confidential
secretary
that
s
why
miss
wheeler
it
s
better
for
you
to
be
frank
with
all
things
has
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
i
m
the
man
who
can
best
help
you
in
this
whole
moil
of
troubles
why
no
she
said
slowly
i
don
t
believe
it
ever
then
realize
it
now
truly
dear
miss
wheeler
i
am
not
only
the
one
who
can
best
help
you
but
i
am
the
only
one
who
can
help
you
at
try
to
see
why
should
i
want
help
for
half
a
dozen
very
good
reasons
first
i
suppose
you
know
that
you
are
in
no
enviable
position
regarding
the
death
of
appleby
oh
i
know
you
didn
t
kill
but
i
did
if
you
did
you
couldn
t
take
it
so
how
dare
you
say
i
take
it
calmly
what
do
you
know
about
it
just
because
i
don
t
go
about
in
s
not
my
no
sign
that
i
m
not
suffering
you
poor
sweet
know
you
are
oh
little
girl
dear
little
t
t
you
let
me
look
out
for
the
words
were
right
enough
but
the
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
the
look
that
accompanied
them
frightened
maida
she
knew
at
once
how
this
man
regarded
her
intuition
told
her
it
was
better
not
to
resent
his
speech
or
meaning
so
she
only
said
quietly
look
out
for
every
way
give
yourself
to
my
own
own
little
mr
keefe
stop
you
forget
you
are
talking
to
an
engaged
i
did
forgive
in
a
moment
he
was
humble
and
penitent
i
lost
my
head
no
miss
wheeler
i
ask
no
reward
i
want
to
help
you
in
any
and
every
you
are
to
be
the
bride
of
only
after
i
m
acquitted
of
this
crime
they
never
convict
a
woman
do
they
keefe
so
that
s
what
you
re
banking
on
and
safely
too
no
miss
wheeler
no
judge
or
jury
would
ever
convict
you
of
murder
but
all
the
same
it
s
a
mighty
unpleasant
process
that
brings
about
your
acquittal
and
i
advise
you
not
to
go
through
with
but
i
ve
got
to
i
ve
confessed
my
crime
now
they
have
to
try
t
they
you
innocent
baby
here
you
re
me
are
you
what
does
that
mean
i
mean
you
didn
t
really
do
the
job
did
you
i
the
calm
glance
of
despair
might
have
carried
conviction
to
a
less
skeptical
hearer
but
keefe
only
looked
puzzled
i
can
t
quite
make
you
out
he
declared
either
you
re
a
very
brave
or
queried
maida
or
you
re
nutty
maida
laughed
outright
that
s
it
she
said
and
her
laughter
became
a
little
hysterical
i
nutty
and
i
own
up
to
it
do
you
think
we
can
enter
a
plea
of
insanity
keefe
looked
at
her
a
new
thought
dawning
in
his
mind
that
might
not
be
at
all
a
bad
plan
he
said
slowly
are
you
in
earnest
i
don
t
know
honestly
i
think
of
so
many
plans
and
discard
them
one
after
the
other
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
convicted
and
you
shan
t
there
are
more
persons
in
this
world
than
the
three
wheelers
and
one
of
them
may
easily
be
the
murderer
we
re
which
one
asked
maida
the
phantom
bugler
returned
keefe
chapter
xi
fleming
stone
next
day
brought
the
advent
of
two
men
and
a
boy
to
sycamore
ridge
samuel
appleby
determined
to
discover
the
murderer
of
his
father
and
convinced
that
it
was
none
of
the
wheeler
family
had
brought
fleming
stone
the
detective
to
investigate
the
case
stone
had
a
young
assistant
who
always
accompanied
him
and
this
lad
terence
mcguire
by
name
was
a
lively
irrepressible
chap
with
red
hair
and
freckles
but
his
quick
thinking
and
native
wit
rendered
him
invaluable
to
stone
who
had
already
hinted
that
mcguire
might
some
day
become
his
successor
the
wheeler
family
jeffrey
allen
curtis
keefe
and
burdon
the
local
detective
were
all
gathered
in
wheeler
s
den
to
recount
the
whole
story
to
fleming
stone
with
grave
attention
stone
listened
and
young
mcguire
eagerly
drank
in
each
word
as
if
committing
a
lesson
to
memory
which
indeed
he
was
for
stone
depended
on
his
helper
to
remember
all
facts
theories
and
suggestions
put
forward
by
the
speakers
long
experience
had
made
fleming
stone
a
connoisseur
in
cases
and
by
a
classification
of
his
own
he
divided
them
into
express
and
by
this
distinction
he
meant
that
in
the
former
cases
he
arrived
quickly
at
the
solution
without
stop
or
hindrance
the
latter
kind
involved
necessary
stops
even
side
issues
and
a
generally
impeded
course
by
reason
of
conflicting
motives
and
tangled
clues
as
he
listened
to
the
story
unfolded
by
the
members
of
the
party
he
sighed
for
he
knew
this
was
no
lightning
express
affair
he
foresaw
much
investigation
ahead
of
him
and
he
already
suspected
false
evidence
and
perhaps
bribed
witnesses
yet
these
conclusions
of
his
were
based
quite
as
much
on
intuition
as
on
evidence
and
stone
did
not
wholly
trust
intuition
samuel
appleby
was
the
principal
spokesman
as
he
was
the
one
chiefly
concerned
in
the
discovery
of
the
criminal
and
the
avenging
of
his
father
s
death
moreover
he
was
positive
the
deed
had
not
been
done
by
any
one
of
the
wheeler
family
and
he
greatly
desired
to
prove
himself
right
in
this
but
you
were
not
here
at
the
time
appleby
stone
said
and
i
must
get
the
story
from
those
who
were
keefe
you
came
with
appleby
senior
and
also
as
his
confidential
secretary
you
are
in
a
position
to
know
of
his
mental
attitudes
had
he
to
your
knowledge
any
fear
any
premonition
of
evil
befalling
him
not
at
all
answered
keefe
promptly
if
he
had
i
do
not
know
of
it
but
i
think
i
can
affirm
that
he
had
not
for
when
appleby
was
anxious
he
always
showed
it
in
many
ways
it
was
noticeable
if
he
had
a
perplexity
on
his
mind
in
such
a
case
he
was
irritable
and
often
the
day
we
came
down
here
appleby
was
genial
affable
and
in
a
kindly
mood
this
to
my
mind
quite
precludes
the
idea
that
he
looked
for
anything
how
did
he
impress
you
wheeler
stone
went
on
you
had
not
seen
him
for
some
time
i
not
for
fifteen
years
dan
wheeler
spoke
calmly
and
with
an
air
of
determined
reserve
our
meeting
was
such
as
might
be
expected
between
two
enemies
but
appleby
was
polite
and
so
was
he
came
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
rather
to
drive
a
bargain
he
offered
me
a
full
pardon
in
return
for
my
assistance
in
his
son
s
political
campaign
you
i
am
sure
know
all
this
from
appleby
the
yes
i
do
i
m
asking
you
if
appleby
the
father
showed
in
his
conversation
with
you
any
apprehension
or
gave
any
intimation
of
a
fear
of
disaster
mr
stone
returned
wheeler
i
have
confessed
that
i
killed
appleby
i
hold
therefore
that
i
need
say
nothing
that
will
influence
my
own
well
you
see
wheeler
this
case
is
unique
in
that
three
people
have
confessed
to
the
crime
so
far
i
am
preserving
an
open
mind
though
it
is
possible
you
and
your
wife
and
daughter
acted
in
collusion
only
one
of
you
could
have
fired
the
fatal
shot
yet
you
all
three
claim
to
have
done
so
there
is
no
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
this
but
that
one
is
guilty
and
the
other
two
are
shielding
that
draw
any
conclusion
you
wish
said
wheeler
still
imperturbably
but
i
ve
no
objection
to
replying
to
the
question
you
asked
me
sam
appleby
said
no
word
to
me
that
hinted
at
a
fear
for
his
personal
safety
if
he
had
any
such
fear
he
kept
it
to
he
knew
of
your
enmity
toward
him
of
course
he
did
me
an
unforgivable
injustice
and
i
never
pretended
that
i
did
not
resent
and
you
refused
to
meet
his
wishes
regarding
his
son
s
campaign
i
most
certainly
did
for
the
same
reasons
i
opposed
his
own
election
many
years
yes
all
those
details
i
have
from
appleby
junior
now
appleby
does
not
believe
that
his
father
was
killed
by
any
member
of
your
family
can
he
then
produce
the
man
whom
he
does
suspect
no
he
suspects
no
one
definitely
but
he
thinks
that
by
investigation
i
can
find
out
the
real
you
may
as
well
save
your
time
and
trouble
stone
i
am
the
man
you
seek
i
freely
confess
my
crime
and
i
accept
my
fate
whatever
it
be
can
i
do
more
yes
if
you
are
telling
the
truth
go
on
and
relate
details
what
weapon
did
you
use
my
own
where
is
it
i
threw
it
out
of
the
which
window
bay
window
in
my
in
this
room
that
window
there
stone
pointed
to
the
big
bay
you
were
sitting
there
at
the
time
of
the
shot
were
you
not
miss
wheeler
stone
turned
to
maida
who
and
trembling
listened
to
her
father
s
statements
i
was
sitting
there
before
the
shot
the
girl
returned
speaking
in
quiet
steady
tones
though
a
red
spot
burned
in
either
cheek
and
then
when
appleby
threatened
my
father
i
shot
him
myself
my
father
is
untruthful
for
my
sake
in
his
love
for
me
he
is
trying
to
take
my
crime
on
himself
oh
believe
me
stone
others
can
testify
that
i
said
long
ago
that
i
could
willingly
kill
appleby
he
has
made
my
dear
father
s
life
a
living
grave
he
has
changed
a
brilliant
capable
man
of
affairs
to
a
sad
and
recluse
a
man
who
had
everything
to
live
for
everything
to
interest
and
occupy
his
mind
was
condemned
to
a
solitary
imprisonment
save
for
the
company
of
his
family
my
father
s
career
would
have
been
notable
celebrated
but
that
samuel
appleby
put
an
end
to
fifteen
years
ago
for
no
reason
but
petty
spite
and
mean
revenge
i
had
never
seen
the
man
save
as
a
small
child
and
when
i
learned
he
was
at
last
coming
here
my
primitive
passions
were
stirred
my
sense
of
justice
awoke
and
my
whole
soul
was
absorbed
in
a
wild
impulse
to
rid
the
world
of
such
a
demon
in
human
form
i
told
my
parents
i
was
capable
of
killing
him
they
reproved
me
so
i
said
no
more
but
i
brooded
over
the
project
and
made
ready
and
appleby
threatened
my
father
talked
to
him
brutally
scathingly
fairly
turning
the
iron
in
his
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
i
shot
him
down
as
i
would
have
killed
a
venomous
serpent
i
do
not
regret
the
i
do
fear
the
maida
almost
collapsed
but
pulled
herself
together
to
add
that
is
the
truth
you
must
disregard
and
disbelieve
my
father
s
noble
efforts
to
save
me
by
trying
to
pretend
the
crime
was
his
stone
looked
at
her
pityingly
mcguire
stared
fixedly
the
boy
s
eyes
round
with
amazement
at
this
outburst
of
then
stone
said
almost
casually
you
too
wheeler
confess
to
this
crime
i
i
am
the
real
criminal
sara
wheeler
asserted
speaking
very
quietly
but
with
a
steady
gaze
into
the
eyes
of
the
listening
detective
you
can
readily
understand
that
my
husband
and
daughter
are
trying
to
shield
me
when
i
tell
you
that
only
i
had
opportunity
i
had
possessed
myself
of
wheeler
s
pistol
and
as
i
ran
knowing
the
conversation
that
was
going
on
i
shot
through
the
doors
as
i
passed
and
running
on
threw
the
weapon
far
out
into
the
shrubbery
it
can
doubtless
be
found
i
must
beg
of
you
stone
that
you
thoroughly
investigate
these
three
stories
and
i
assure
you
you
will
find
mine
the
true
one
and
the
assertions
of
my
husband
and
daughter
merely
loving
but
futile
attempts
to
save
me
from
the
consequences
of
my
fleming
stone
smiled
a
queer
tender
little
smile
it
is
certainly
a
new
experience
for
me
he
said
when
a
whole
family
insist
on
being
considered
criminals
but
i
will
reserve
decision
until
i
can
look
into
matters
a
little
more
fully
now
who
can
give
me
any
information
on
the
matter
outside
of
the
identity
of
the
criminal
jeffrey
allen
volunteered
the
story
of
the
fire
and
keefe
told
of
the
strange
bugle
call
that
had
been
heard
you
heard
it
keefe
asked
stone
after
listening
to
the
account
no
i
was
with
appleby
on
a
trip
to
boston
i
tell
it
as
i
heard
the
tale
from
the
household
whereupon
the
wheeler
family
corroborated
keefe
s
story
and
fleming
stone
listened
attentively
to
the
various
repetitions
you
find
that
bugler
and
you
ve
got
your
murderer
curtis
keefe
said
bluntly
you
agree
don
t
you
stone
that
it
was
no
phantom
who
blew
audible
notes
on
a
bugle
i
most
certainly
agree
to
that
i
ve
heard
many
legends
in
foreign
countries
of
ghostly
drummers
buglers
and
bagpipers
but
they
are
merely
ve
never
found
anyone
who
really
heard
the
sounds
and
moreover
those
things
aren
t
even
legends
in
america
any
bugling
done
in
this
country
is
done
by
human
lungs
now
this
bugler
interests
me
i
think
with
you
keefe
that
to
know
his
identity
would
help
he
proves
to
be
the
criminal
or
he
s
the
criminal
keefe
declared
again
forgive
me
stone
if
my
certainty
seems
to
you
presumptuous
or
forward
but
i
m
so
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
innocence
of
the
wheeler
family
that
perhaps
i
am
overenthusiastic
in
my
a
theory
doesn
t
depend
on
enthusiasm
returned
stone
but
on
evidence
and
proof
now
how
can
we
set
about
finding
this
mysterious
phantom
or
human
i
thought
that
s
what
you
re
here
to
do
sam
appleby
said
looking
helplessly
at
fleming
stone
we
are
piped
up
terence
mcguire
as
stone
made
no
reply
that
s
our
business
and
consequentially
it
shall
be
the
boy
assumed
an
air
of
importance
that
was
saved
from
being
objectionable
by
his
face
and
frank
serious
eyes
i
ll
just
start
in
and
get
busy
now
he
went
on
and
rising
he
bobbed
a
funny
little
bow
that
included
all
present
and
left
the
room
it
was
and
as
they
looked
out
on
the
wide
lawn
they
saw
mcguire
strolling
slowly
hands
in
pockets
and
seemingly
more
absorbed
in
the
birds
and
flowers
than
in
his
vaunted
perhaps
mcguire
needs
a
little
explanation
stone
smiled
he
is
my
man
and
a
great
help
in
detail
work
but
he
has
a
not
altogether
unearned
reputation
for
untruthfulness
indeed
his
nickname
is
fibsy
because
of
a
congenital
habit
of
telling
fibs
i
advise
you
of
this
because
i
prefer
you
should
not
place
implicit
confidence
in
his
but
stone
cried
maida
greatly
interested
how
can
he
be
of
any
help
to
you
if
you
can
t
depend
on
what
he
says
oh
he
doesn
t
lie
to
me
stone
assured
her
nor
does
he
tell
whoppers
at
any
time
only
it
s
his
habit
to
shade
the
truth
when
it
seems
to
him
advisable
i
do
not
defend
this
habit
in
fact
i
have
persuaded
him
to
stop
it
to
a
degree
but
you
know
how
hard
it
is
to
reform
it
won
t
affect
his
usefulness
since
he
doesn
t
lie
to
his
employer
appleby
said
and
too
it
s
none
of
our
business
i
ve
engaged
stone
to
solve
the
mystery
of
my
father
s
death
and
i
m
prepared
to
give
him
full
powers
he
may
conduct
his
investigations
on
any
plan
he
chooses
my
only
stipulation
is
that
he
shall
find
a
criminal
outside
the
wheeler
a
difficult
and
somewhat
unusual
stipulation
remarked
stone
why
difficult
dan
wheeler
said
quickly
because
with
three
people
confessing
a
crime
and
no
one
else
even
remotely
suspected
save
a
mysterious
and
perhaps
mythical
it
does
not
seem
an
easy
job
to
hunt
up
and
then
hunt
down
a
but
you
ll
do
it
begged
appleby
almost
pleadingly
for
it
must
be
we
ll
see
stone
replied
and
now
tell
me
more
about
the
fire
in
the
garage
it
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
you
say
what
started
it
but
nobody
knew
what
started
it
how
could
we
know
asked
jeff
allen
it
was
only
a
small
fire
and
the
most
it
burned
was
the
robe
in
appleby
s
own
car
and
a
motor
coat
that
was
also
in
the
whose
coat
asked
stone
mine
said
keefe
ruefully
a
bit
of
bad
luck
too
for
it
was
a
new
one
i
had
to
get
another
in
place
of
and
you
think
the
fire
was
the
result
of
a
dropped
cigarette
or
match
by
appleby
s
chauffeur
i
don
t
know
returned
keefe
he
denies
it
of
course
but
it
must
have
been
that
or
an
incendiary
act
of
some
maybe
the
bugler
person
suggested
stone
maybe
assented
keefe
though
he
did
not
look
convinced
i
think
keefe
thinks
it
was
the
work
of
my
own
men
said
dan
wheeler
and
it
may
have
been
there
s
one
in
my
employ
who
has
an
ignorant
brutal
spirit
of
revenge
and
if
he
thought
samuel
appleby
was
inimical
to
me
he
would
be
quite
capable
of
setting
fire
to
the
appleby
car
that
may
be
the
fact
of
the
it
may
be
agreed
stone
doubtless
we
can
find
how
asked
allen
that
would
be
magician
s
work
i
a
detective
has
to
be
a
magician
stone
smiled
at
him
we
quite
often
do
more
astounding
tricks
than
go
to
it
then
cried
appleby
that
s
the
talk
i
like
to
hear
questions
and
answers
any
of
us
can
put
over
but
the
real
detecting
is
like
magic
at
least
i
can
t
see
how
it
s
done
duff
in
stone
get
the
group
dispersed
then
fleming
stone
going
to
his
room
and
the
others
straying
off
by
twos
or
threes
burdon
who
had
said
almost
nothing
during
the
confab
declared
he
wanted
a
talk
with
the
great
detective
alone
and
would
await
his
pleasure
so
burdon
sat
by
himself
brooding
on
the
veranda
and
presently
saw
the
boy
fibsy
returning
toward
the
house
come
here
young
one
burdon
called
out
nixy
old
one
was
the
saucy
retort
why
not
in
a
conciliatory
tone
cause
you
spoke
disrespectful
like
i
m
a
detective
you
all
right
old
pal
come
here
will
you
fibsy
grinned
and
came
seating
himself
on
a
cushioned
swing
nearby
whatcha
want
he
demanded
only
a
line
o
talk
your
stone
now
do
you
think
he
ll
show
up
soon
or
has
he
gone
for
a
nap
fleming
stone
doesn
t
take
naps
fibsy
said
disdainfully
he
isn
t
that
then
he
ll
be
down
again
shortly
dunno
maybe
he
s
begun
his
fasting
and
prayer
over
this
phenomenal
does
he
do
that
how
do
i
know
i
m
not
of
a
curious
turn
of
mind
me
havin
other
sins
to
answer
i
know
stone
told
us
you
have
no
respect
for
the
did
he
now
well
he
s
some
mistaken
i
have
such
a
profound
respect
for
the
truth
that
i
never
use
it
except
on
very
special
is
this
one
it
is
not
don
t
believe
a
word
i
say
just
now
in
fact
i
m
so
lit
up
with
the
beauties
and
glories
of
this
place
that
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
ain
t
it
the
though
yes
it
is
looky
here
youngster
can
t
you
go
up
and
coax
stone
to
see
a
few
minutes
nope
can
t
do
that
but
you
spill
it
to
me
and
if
it
s
worth
it
i
ll
repeat
it
to
him
i
m
really
along
for
that
very
purpose
you
but
i
haven
t
anything
special
to
tell
oh
i
see
just
want
the
glory
and
honor
of
chinning
with
the
great
stone
as
this
so
nearly
expressed
burdon
s
intention
he
grinned
sheepishly
and
fibsy
understood
no
go
old
top
he
assured
him
f
stone
will
send
for
you
if
he
thinks
you
ll
interest
him
in
the
slightest
degree
better
wait
for
the
ll
mean
a
more
satisfactory
interview
all
well
then
let
s
you
and
me
chat
a
oho
coming
round
to
sort
of
like
me
are
you
well
i
m
willing
tell
me
this
how
far
from
the
victim
did
the
shooter
stand
the
doctor
said
as
nearly
as
he
could
judge
about
ten
feet
or
so
h
m
and
fibsy
looked
thoughtful
that
would
just
about
suit
all
three
of
the
present
claimants
for
the
honor
wouldn
t
it
yes
and
would
preclude
anybody
not
inside
the
unless
he
was
close
to
the
sure
but
it
ain
t
likely
is
it
now
that
a
rank
outsider
would
come
right
up
to
the
window
and
fire
through
it
and
not
be
seen
by
anybody
no
it
isn
t
and
of
course
if
that
had
happened
and
any
one
of
the
three
wheelers
had
seen
it
they
would
be
only
too
glad
to
tell
of
it
i
wonder
they
haven
t
made
up
some
such
yarn
as
you
don
t
know
the
wheelers
i
do
and
i
can
see
how
they
would
perjure
of
confess
to
a
crime
they
didn
t
commit
to
save
each
it
wouldn
t
occur
to
them
to
invent
a
to
say
they
saw
some
one
they
didn
t
see
do
you
get
the
difference
being
an
expert
in
the
lyin
game
i
do
and
fibsy
winked
it
isn
t
only
that
it
s
not
only
that
they
re
unwilling
to
lie
about
it
but
they
haven
t
well
ingenuity
to
contrive
a
plausible
not
being
lying
experts
just
as
i
said
fibsy
observed
well
we
all
have
our
own
kind
of
cleverness
now
mine
is
finding
things
want
to
see
an
example
yes
i
all
right
how
far
did
you
say
the
shooter
person
stood
from
his
victim
about
ten
i
daresay
it
might
be
two
or
three
feet
more
or
no
they
can
judge
closer
n
that
by
the
powder
marks
the
truth
wouldn
t
vary
more
n
a
foot
or
so
from
their
say
now
s
posin
the
shooter
did
throw
the
revolver
out
of
the
bay
window
as
the
three
wheelers
agree
severally
they
did
do
where
would
it
most
likely
land
in
that
clump
of
yep
if
they
threw
it
straight
ahead
i
s
pose
you
ve
looked
there
for
it
yes
raked
the
place
all
right
now
if
they
slung
the
thing
over
toward
the
right
where
would
it
land
on
the
smooth
and
you
didn
t
find
it
there
no
what
are
you
doing
stringing
me
oh
no
sir
oh
no
now
once
again
if
they
chanced
to
fling
said
revolver
far
to
the
left
where
would
it
land
that
big
bed
of
they
threw
it
far
looked
there
no
i
haven
c
mon
let
s
take
a
fibsy
rose
and
lounged
over
toward
the
fern
bed
burdon
following
almost
certain
he
was
being
made
game
of
chapter
xii
the
garage
fire
now
watch
me
he
said
and
with
a
quick
thrust
of
his
arm
down
among
the
ferns
he
drew
forth
a
revolver
which
he
turned
over
to
burdon
land
o
goodness
exclaimed
that
worthy
howja
know
it
was
there
knew
it
must
for
it
returned
the
boy
nonchalantly
and
then
hearing
a
short
sharp
whistle
he
looked
up
at
the
house
to
see
fleming
stone
regarding
him
from
an
upper
window
found
the
weapon
fibs
he
inquired
yes
all
right
bring
it
up
here
and
ask
burdon
to
come
delighted
at
the
summons
burdon
followed
the
boy
s
flying
feet
and
they
went
up
to
stone
s
rooms
a
small
and
pleasant
had
been
given
over
to
the
detective
and
he
admitted
his
two
visitors
then
closed
the
door
doing
the
spectacular
terence
stone
said
smiling
a
little
just
one
grandstand
play
the
boy
confessed
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
located
the
pistol
sometime
earlier
but
waited
to
make
the
discovery
seem
sensational
all
right
let
s
take
a
look
at
without
hesitation
burdon
pronounced
the
revolver
wheeler
s
it
had
no
initials
on
it
but
from
wheeler
s
minute
description
burdon
recognized
it
beyond
reasonable
doubt
one
bullet
had
been
fired
from
it
and
the
calibre
corresponded
to
the
shot
that
had
killed
samuel
appleby
oh
it
s
the
right
gun
all
right
burdon
said
but
i
never
thought
of
looking
over
that
way
for
it
must
have
been
thrown
by
a
oh
not
necessarily
said
stone
but
it
was
thrown
with
a
conscious
desire
to
hide
it
and
not
flung
away
in
a
careless
or
preoccupied
and
what
do
you
deduce
from
that
asked
burdon
quite
prepared
to
hear
the
description
of
the
murderer
s
physical
appearance
and
mental
attainments
nothing
very
definite
stone
mused
we
might
say
it
looked
more
like
the
act
of
a
man
such
as
wheeler
than
of
a
frightened
and
nervously
agitated
if
either
of
those
two
women
did
it
burdon
offered
she
wasn
t
nervous
or
agitated
they
re
not
that
sort
they
may
go
to
pieces
afterward
but
whatever
wheeler
or
maida
undertake
to
do
they
put
it
over
all
right
i
ve
known
em
for
years
and
i
never
knew
either
of
them
to
show
the
white
well
it
was
not
much
of
an
indication
anyway
stone
admitted
but
it
does
prove
a
steady
nerve
and
a
planning
brain
that
would
realize
the
advisability
of
flinging
the
weapon
where
it
would
not
be
probably
sought
now
as
this
is
wheeler
s
revolver
there
s
no
use
asking
the
three
suspects
anything
about
it
for
each
has
declared
he
or
she
used
it
and
flung
it
away
that
in
itself
is
mean
that
they
should
all
tell
the
same
story
it
suggests
not
collusion
so
much
as
the
idea
that
whoever
did
the
shooting
was
seen
by
one
or
both
of
the
then
you
believe
it
was
one
of
the
three
wheelers
asked
burdon
i
don
t
say
that
yet
returned
stone
but
they
must
be
reckoned
with
i
want
to
eliminate
the
innocent
two
and
put
the
guilt
on
the
that
is
where
it
and
if
not
which
way
are
you
looking
toward
the
fire
that
most
opportune
fire
in
the
garage
seems
to
me
indicative
of
a
criminal
who
wanted
to
create
a
panic
so
he
could
carry
out
his
murderous
design
with
neatness
and
and
that
lets
out
the
women
not
if
as
you
say
they
re
of
the
daring
and
capable
oh
they
are
if
maida
wheeler
did
this
thing
she
could
stage
the
fire
easily
enough
or
wheeler
could
either
they
re
hummers
when
it
comes
to
efficiency
and
actually
doing
things
you
surprise
me
wheeler
seems
such
a
gentle
delicate
yep
till
she
s
roused
then
she
s
full
of
tiger
oh
i
know
sara
wheeler
you
ask
my
wife
what
wheeler
can
do
tell
me
a
little
more
of
this
conditional
pardon
matter
is
it
possible
that
for
fifteen
years
wheeler
has
never
stepped
over
to
the
forbidden
side
of
his
own
house
perfectly
true
but
it
isn
t
his
house
it
s
wheeler
s
her
folks
are
connected
with
the
applebys
and
it
was
the
work
of
old
appleby
that
the
property
came
to
sara
with
that
tag
attached
that
she
must
live
in
massachusetts
also
appleby
pardoned
wheeler
on
condition
that
he
never
stepped
foot
into
massachusetts
and
there
they
were
it
was
sara
wheeler
s
ingenuity
and
determination
that
planned
the
house
on
the
state
line
and
she
has
seen
to
it
that
dan
wheeler
never
broke
parole
it
s
second
nature
to
him
now
of
but
i
m
told
that
he
did
step
over
the
night
of
the
murder
that
he
went
into
the
of
his
maybe
into
the
forbidden
end
of
that
long
see
the
fire
it
would
be
a
most
natural
thing
for
him
to
not
natural
no
burdon
rubbed
his
brow
thoughtfully
yet
he
might
a
done
it
but
one
misstep
like
that
ought
to
be
overlooked
i
and
would
be
by
his
suppose
there
s
an
enemy
at
work
suppose
just
as
a
theory
that
somebody
is
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
peculiar
situation
that
seems
to
prove
dan
wheeler
was
either
outside
his
prescribed
he
was
the
murderer
to
my
way
of
thinking
at
present
that
man
s
alibi
is
his
absence
from
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
if
he
was
absent
he
must
have
been
over
the
line
i
know
this
from
talks
i
ve
had
with
the
servants
and
the
family
and
guests
and
i
m
pretty
confident
that
wheeler
was
either
in
the
den
or
in
the
forbidden
north
part
of
the
house
at
the
moment
of
the
why
don
t
you
know
which
it
was
asked
burdon
bluntly
because
said
stone
not
resenting
the
question
because
i
can
t
place
any
dependence
on
the
truth
of
the
family
s
statements
for
three
respectable
citizens
they
are
most
astonishingly
willing
even
eager
to
perjure
themselves
of
course
i
know
they
do
it
for
one
another
s
sake
they
have
a
strange
conscience
that
allows
them
to
lie
outright
for
the
sake
of
a
loved
one
and
it
may
be
commit
murder
for
the
sake
of
a
loved
one
but
all
this
i
shall
straighten
out
when
i
get
further
along
the
case
is
so
widespread
so
full
of
ramifications
and
possible
side
issues
i
have
to
go
carefully
at
first
and
not
get
entangled
in
false
got
any
clue
sir
any
real
ones
meaning
dropped
handkerchiefs
and
broken
stone
chaffed
him
well
there
s
the
pistol
that
s
a
material
clue
but
no
i
can
t
produce
anything
present
well
terence
what
luck
fibsy
who
had
slipped
from
the
room
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
interview
now
returned
it
s
puzzlin
s
what
it
is
puzzlin
he
declared
throwing
himself
astride
of
a
chair
i
ve
raked
that
old
garage
fore
and
aft
but
i
can
t
track
down
the
startings
of
that
fire
you
see
the
place
is
stucco
and
all
that
and
besides
the
discipline
of
this
whole
layout
is
along
the
lines
of
p
ison
neatness
everybody
that
works
at
sycamore
ridge
has
to
be
a
very
old
maid
for
keeping
things
clean
so
there
s
no
chance
for
accumulated
rubbish
or
old
rags
or
spontaneous
combustion
or
anything
of
the
sort
nextly
none
of
the
three
men
who
have
any
call
to
go
into
the
garage
ever
smoke
in
there
that
s
a
mede
and
persian
law
gee
wheeler
is
some
efficient
boss
well
anyway
after
the
fire
though
they
tried
every
way
to
find
out
what
started
it
they
couldn
t
find
a
thing
there
was
no
explanation
but
a
brand
dropped
from
the
skies
or
a
stroke
of
lightning
and
there
was
no
storm
on
it
wouldn
t
all
be
so
sure
but
the
morning
after
it
seems
allen
and
keefe
were
doin
some
sleuthin
on
their
own
and
they
couldn
t
find
out
how
the
fire
started
so
they
put
it
up
to
the
garage
men
and
they
hunted
too
it
seems
nothing
was
burnt
but
some
things
in
appleby
s
car
which
of
course
lets
out
his
chauffeur
who
had
no
call
to
burn
up
his
own
duds
and
a
coat
of
his
was
burned
and
also
a
coat
of
keefe
what
were
those
coats
doing
in
an
unused
car
asked
stone
oh
they
were
extra
motor
coats
or
raincoats
or
something
like
that
and
they
always
staid
in
the
where
in
the
car
i
asked
that
fibsy
returned
and
they
were
hanging
on
the
i
thought
there
might
have
been
matches
in
the
pockets
but
they
say
no
there
never
had
been
matches
in
those
coat
pockets
nor
any
matches
in
the
appleby
car
for
that
well
the
fire
is
pretty
well
mixed
up
in
the
murder
declared
stone
now
it
s
up
to
us
to
find
out
me
stone
and
burdon
shook
his
head
you
ll
never
get
at
it
that
me
burdon
fibsy
flared
back
mr
stone
get
at
it
that
way
if
he
thinks
that
s
the
way
to
look
you
don
t
know
stone
hush
up
fibs
burdon
will
know
if
i
succeed
and
perhaps
he
s
right
as
to
the
unimportance
of
the
fire
after
you
see
burdon
went
on
unabashed
mr
he
s
some
smart
in
the
detective
said
find
your
phantom
bugler
and
you
ve
got
your
murderer
now
what
nonsense
that
is
as
if
a
marauding
villain
would
announce
himself
by
playing
on
a
bugle
yet
there
may
be
something
in
it
demurred
stone
it
may
well
be
that
the
dramatic
mind
that
staged
this
whole
mysterious
affair
is
responsible
for
the
bugle
call
the
fire
and
the
final
in
that
case
it
s
one
of
the
women
burdon
said
they
could
do
all
that
either
of
them
if
they
wanted
to
but
dan
wheeler
while
he
could
kill
a
man
on
would
be
an
impulsive
a
premeditated
one
no
sir
wheeler
could
see
red
and
go
berserk
but
he
couldn
t
plan
out
a
complicated
affair
like
you
re
turning
this
case
into
i
m
not
turning
it
into
anything
stone
laughed
i
m
taking
it
as
it
is
presented
to
me
but
i
do
hold
that
the
phantom
bugler
and
the
opportune
fire
are
theatrical
a
theatrical
element
too
is
the
big
sycamore
and
burdon
smiled
now
if
that
tree
should
take
a
notion
to
walk
over
into
massachusetts
it
would
help
out
what
s
that
cried
fibsy
what
do
you
mean
well
the
wheelers
have
got
a
letter
from
appleby
written
while
he
was
still
governor
and
it
says
that
when
the
big
sycamore
goes
into
massachusetts
wheeler
can
go
too
but
it
can
t
be
done
by
a
trick
i
mean
they
can
t
transplant
the
thing
or
chop
it
down
and
take
the
wood
over
it
s
got
to
go
of
its
own
mere
teasing
said
stone
yes
sir
just
that
appleby
had
a
great
streak
of
teasing
he
used
to
tease
everybody
just
for
the
fun
of
seeing
them
squirm
this
whole
wheeler
business
was
the
outcome
of
appleby
s
distorted
love
of
fun
and
wheeler
took
it
so
seriously
that
appleby
kept
it
up
i
ll
warrant
if
wheeler
had
treated
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
appleby
would
have
let
up
on
him
but
dan
wheeler
is
a
solemn
old
chap
and
he
saw
no
fun
in
the
whole
i
don
t
blame
him
commented
stone
won
t
he
get
pardoned
now
no
sir
he
won
t
some
folks
think
he
will
but
i
know
better
the
present
governor
isn
t
much
for
pardoning
old
says
it
establishes
precedent
and
all
that
and
the
next
governor
is
more
than
likely
to
say
the
i
hear
young
appleby
isn
t
going
to
no
sir
he
ain
t
though
i
daresay
he
will
some
other
time
but
this
death
of
his
father
and
the
mystery
and
all
is
no
sort
of
help
to
a
campaign
and
too
young
appleby
hasn
t
the
necessary
qualifications
to
conduct
a
campaign
however
good
he
might
be
as
governor
after
he
got
elected
no
sam
won
t
who
will
dunno
i
m
sure
but
there
ll
be
lots
ready
and
eager
for
a
try
at
i
suppose
so
well
burdon
i
m
going
down
now
to
ask
some
questions
of
the
servants
you
know
they
re
a
mine
of
information
kin
i
go
asked
fibsy
not
now
son
you
stay
here
or
do
what
you
like
but
don
t
say
much
and
don
t
antagonize
not
me
stone
well
don
t
shock
anybody
then
behave
like
a
gentleman
and
a
yessir
fibsy
ducked
a
comical
bow
and
burdon
understanding
he
was
dismissed
went
home
to
the
stone
made
his
way
and
asked
a
maid
there
if
he
might
see
the
cook
greatly
frightened
the
waitress
brought
the
cook
to
the
but
the
newcomer
a
typical
individual
was
not
at
all
abashed
what
is
it
you
do
be
wantin
sor
she
asked
civilly
enough
but
a
trifle
sullenly
only
a
few
answers
to
direct
questions
where
were
you
when
you
first
heard
the
alarm
of
the
garage
fire
i
was
in
me
kitchen
cleanin
up
after
what
did
you
do
i
ran
out
the
kitchen
door
and
seein
flames
i
ran
toward
the
before
you
ran
you
were
at
the
rear
of
the
mean
the
south
side
weren
t
you
yes
sor
i
you
passed
along
the
south
veranda
not
along
it
the
cook
looked
at
him
but
by
the
end
of
it
and
did
you
see
any
one
on
the
veranda
any
one
at
all
the
woman
thought
hard
well
i
sh
d
have
said
now
you
speak
of
it
i
must
say
i
do
have
a
remimbrance
of
seein
a
sort
of
vague
you
mean
your
memory
of
it
is
don
t
mean
a
shadowy
figure
no
sor
i
mean
i
can
t
mind
it
rightly
now
for
i
was
thinkin
intirely
of
the
fire
and
so
as
i
was
runnin
past
the
end
of
the
verandy
all
i
can
say
is
i
just
glimpsed
like
a
person
standin
standing
well
he
might
have
been
are
you
sure
it
was
a
man
i
m
not
i
m
thinkin
it
was
but
yet
i
couldn
t
speak
it
for
then
you
went
on
to
the
fire
yes
and
thought
no
more
about
the
person
on
the
veranda
no
sor
and
it
niver
wud
have
entered
me
head
again
savin
your
speakin
of
it
now
it
man
oh
probably
not
but
everything
i
can
learn
is
of
help
in
discovering
the
criminal
and
perhaps
freeing
your
employers
from
and
i
wish
that
might
be
to
put
it
on
the
good
man
now
and
worse
upon
the
both
of
them
you
are
fond
of
the
family
then
i
am
that
i
ve
worked
here
for
eight
years
and
never
a
cross
word
from
the
missus
or
the
master
as
for
miss
s
my
they
re
fortunate
in
having
you
here
said
stone
kindly
that
s
all
now
cook
unless
you
can
remember
anything
more
of
that
person
you
nothin
more
sor
if
i
do
i
ll
tell
thinking
hard
stone
left
her
it
was
the
most
unusual
case
he
had
ever
attempted
if
he
looked
no
further
for
the
murderer
than
the
wheeler
family
he
still
had
enough
to
do
in
deciding
which
one
of
the
three
was
guilty
but
he
yearned
for
another
suspect
not
a
foolish
phantom
that
went
around
piping
or
a
perhaps
imaginary
prowler
stalking
on
the
piazza
but
a
real
suspect
with
a
sound
plausible
motive
though
to
be
sure
the
wheelers
had
motive
enough
to
be
condemned
to
an
absurd
restriction
and
then
teased
about
it
was
enough
to
make
life
gall
and
wormwood
to
a
sensitive
man
like
wheeler
and
who
could
say
what
words
had
passed
between
them
at
that
final
interview
perhaps
appleby
had
goaded
him
to
the
breaking
point
perhaps
wheeler
had
stood
it
but
his
wife
descending
the
stairs
and
hearing
the
men
talk
had
grown
desperate
at
last
or
and
stone
knew
he
thought
this
most
plausible
of
all
perhaps
maida
in
her
had
stood
as
long
as
she
could
the
aspersions
and
tauntings
directed
at
her
adored
father
and
had
with
a
reckless
disregard
of
consequences
silenced
the
enemy
forever
of
young
allen
stone
had
no
slightest
suspicion
to
be
sure
his
interests
were
one
with
the
wheeler
family
and
moreover
he
had
hoped
for
a
release
from
restrictions
that
would
let
the
wheelers
go
into
massachusetts
and
thereby
make
possible
his
home
there
with
maida
for
maida
s
vow
that
she
would
never
go
into
the
state
if
her
father
could
not
go
too
was
allen
knew
inviolable
all
this
stone
mulled
over
yet
had
no
thought
that
allen
was
the
one
he
was
seeking
also
curtis
keefe
had
testified
that
allen
was
with
him
at
the
fire
during
the
time
that
included
the
moment
of
shooting
strolling
out
into
the
gardens
the
detective
made
his
way
to
the
great
tree
the
big
sycamore
here
fibsy
joined
him
and
at
stone
s
tacit
nod
of
permission
the
boy
sat
down
beside
his
superior
on
the
bench
under
the
tree
what
s
this
about
the
tree
going
to
massachusetts
fibsy
asked
his
freckled
face
earnestly
inquiring
one
of
old
appleby
s
jokes
stone
returned
doubtless
made
just
after
a
reading
of
you
know
or
if
you
don
t
you
must
read
it
up
for
yourself
there
s
a
scene
there
that
hinges
on
birnam
wood
going
to
dunsinane
i
can
t
take
time
to
tell
you
about
it
but
quite
evidently
it
pleased
the
old
wag
to
tell
wheeler
that
he
could
go
into
his
native
state
when
this
great
tree
went
meaning
not
at
all
i
s
of
course
and
any
human
intervention
was
not
allowed
so
though
birnam
wood
brought
to
dunsinane
such
a
trick
is
not
permissible
in
his
case
however
that
s
beside
the
point
just
now
have
you
seen
any
of
the
servants
some
but
i
got
nothing
they
re
willing
enough
to
talk
but
they
don
t
know
anything
they
say
i
d
better
tackle
the
ladies
maid
a
fair
rachel
so
i
m
going
for
her
but
i
bet
i
won
t
strike
you
may
skip
along
now
for
here
comes
miss
maida
and
she
s
probably
looking
for
fibsy
departed
and
maida
looking
relieved
to
find
stone
alone
came
quickly
toward
him
you
see
stone
she
began
you
must
straight
in
this
thing
and
the
only
start
possible
is
for
you
to
be
convinced
that
i
killed
but
you
must
admit
miss
wheeler
that
i
am
not
absurd
in
thinking
that
though
you
say
you
did
it
you
are
saying
it
to
shield
some
one
one
who
is
near
and
dear
to
i
know
you
think
it
isn
t
so
how
can
i
convince
you
only
by
circumstantial
evidence
let
me
question
you
a
bit
where
did
you
get
the
revolver
from
my
father
s
desk
drawer
where
he
always
keeps
you
are
familiar
with
firearms
my
father
taught
me
to
shoot
years
ago
i
m
not
a
crack
that
was
not
you
premeditated
the
deed
for
some
time
i
have
felt
that
i
wanted
to
kill
that
your
conscience
is
very
active
i
deliberately
went
against
its
dictates
for
my
father
s
and
you
killed
appleby
because
he
hounded
your
father
in
addition
to
the
long
deprivation
he
had
imposed
on
him
no
not
that
alone
oh
i
don
t
want
to
tell
if
you
won
t
believe
me
otherwise
stone
i
will
admit
that
i
had
a
new
a
new
one
yes
a
secret
that
i
learned
only
a
day
or
so
appleby
s
the
secret
was
appleby
s
yes
that
is
he
knew
it
he
told
it
to
me
if
any
one
else
should
know
it
it
would
mean
the
utter
ruin
and
desolation
of
the
lives
of
my
parents
compared
to
which
this
present
condition
of
living
is
paradise
itself
this
is
true
miss
wheeler
absolutely
true
do
you
understand
why
i
killed
him
chapter
xiii
sara
wheeler
fleming
stone
was
deeply
interested
in
the
appleby
case
while
his
logical
brain
could
see
no
possible
way
to
look
save
toward
one
of
the
three
wheelers
yet
his
soul
revolted
at
the
thought
that
any
one
of
them
was
the
criminal
stone
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
least
seemingly
guilty
often
proved
to
be
a
villain
yet
he
hesitated
to
think
that
dan
wheeler
had
killed
his
old
enemy
and
he
could
not
believe
it
was
a
woman
s
work
he
was
impressed
by
maida
s
story
especially
by
the
fact
that
a
recent
development
had
made
her
more
strongly
desirous
to
be
rid
of
old
appleby
he
wondered
if
it
did
not
have
something
to
do
with
young
appleby
s
desire
to
marry
her
and
determined
to
persuade
her
to
confide
further
in
him
regarding
the
secret
she
mentioned
but
first
he
decided
to
interview
wheeler
this
could
not
be
done
offhand
so
he
waited
a
convenient
season
and
asked
for
a
conference
when
he
felt
sure
it
would
be
granted
sara
wheeler
received
the
detective
in
her
and
her
manner
was
calm
and
collected
as
she
asked
him
to
make
the
interview
as
brief
as
possible
you
are
not
well
wheeler
stone
asked
courteously
i
am
not
ill
stone
but
naturally
these
dreadful
days
have
upset
me
and
the
horror
and
suspense
are
still
hanging
over
me
can
you
not
bring
matters
to
a
crisis
anything
would
be
better
than
present
conditions
if
some
member
of
your
family
would
tell
me
the
truth
stone
said
frankly
it
would
help
a
great
deal
you
know
wheeler
when
three
people
insist
on
being
regarded
as
the
criminal
it
s
difficult
to
choose
among
them
now
won
t
you
at
least
admit
that
you
didn
t
shoot
appleby
but
i
did
and
the
serene
eyes
looked
at
stone
calmly
can
you
prove
mean
to
my
satisfaction
tell
me
this
where
did
you
get
a
pistol
i
used
wheeler
s
where
did
you
get
it
from
the
drawer
in
his
desk
where
he
always
keeps
stone
sighed
of
course
both
maida
and
her
mother
knew
where
the
revolver
was
kept
so
this
was
no
test
of
their
veracity
as
to
the
crime
when
did
you
take
it
from
the
drawer
sara
wheeler
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
from
that
stone
knew
that
she
had
to
think
before
she
spoke
had
she
been
telling
the
truth
he
argued
she
would
have
answered
at
once
but
immediately
she
spoke
though
with
a
shade
of
hesitation
i
took
it
earlier
in
the
had
it
up
in
my
own
yes
where
did
you
conceal
it
there
a
dresser
and
when
you
heard
the
alarm
of
fire
you
ran
downstairs
in
you
paused
to
get
the
revolver
and
take
it
with
you
this
sounded
absurd
but
sara
wheeler
could
see
no
way
out
of
it
so
she
assented
feeling
sure
that
you
would
find
your
husband
and
appleby
in
such
a
desperate
quarrel
that
you
would
be
called
upon
to
shoot
overheard
the
quarrel
from
upstairs
she
faltered
her
eyes
piteous
now
with
a
baffled
despair
then
you
went
down
because
of
the
quarreling
because
of
the
unable
to
meet
stone
s
inexorable
gaze
wheeler
s
eyes
fell
and
she
nervously
responded
well
it
was
now
see
here
stone
said
kindly
you
want
to
do
anything
you
can
don
t
you
to
help
your
husband
and
daughter
yes
of
course
and
the
eyes
now
looked
at
him
hopefully
then
will
you
trust
me
far
enough
to
believe
that
i
think
you
will
best
help
them
by
telling
the
truth
oh
i
can
t
and
with
a
low
moan
the
distracted
woman
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
please
do
your
attitude
proves
you
are
concealing
important
information
i
am
more
than
ever
sure
you
are
not
the
guilty
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
it
was
either
of
the
other
then
who
could
it
have
been
and
sara
wheeler
looked
amazed
that
we
don
t
know
if
i
had
a
hint
of
any
direction
to
look
i
d
be
glad
but
if
you
will
shed
what
light
you
can
it
may
be
of
great
even
if
it
seems
to
incriminate
what
can
incriminate
them
more
than
their
own
confessions
their
confessions
contradict
each
other
they
can
t
both
be
and
you
don
t
know
which
one
is
came
the
faltering
reply
but
that
admission
contradicts
your
own
confession
come
now
wheeler
own
up
to
me
that
you
didn
t
do
it
and
i
ll
not
tell
any
one
else
unless
it
becomes
i
will
tell
you
for
i
can
t
bear
this
burden
alone
any
longer
i
did
go
downstairs
because
of
the
alarm
of
fire
stone
just
before
i
came
to
the
open
door
of
the
den
i
heard
a
shot
and
as
i
passed
the
door
of
the
den
i
saw
appleby
fallen
slightly
forward
in
his
chair
my
husband
standing
at
a
little
distance
looking
at
him
and
maida
in
the
bay
window
also
staring
at
them
what
did
you
do
go
in
no
i
was
so
bewildered
i
scarcely
knew
which
way
to
turn
and
in
my
fear
and
horror
i
ran
into
my
own
and
fell
on
the
couch
there
in
sheer
you
stayed
there
until
i
heard
voices
in
the
men
came
back
from
the
fire
and
discovered
tragedy
at
least
i
think
that
s
the
way
it
was
it
s
all
mixed
up
in
my
mind
usually
i
m
very
and
strong
nerved
but
that
scene
seemed
to
take
away
all
my
my
i
don
t
wonder
what
did
you
do
or
say
i
had
a
vague
fear
that
my
husband
or
daughter
would
be
accused
of
the
crime
and
so
at
once
i
declared
it
was
the
work
of
the
phantom
bugler
you
ve
heard
about
him
yes
you
didn
t
think
it
was
he
though
did
you
i
wanted
i
think
i
did
you
see
i
don
t
think
the
bugler
was
a
phantom
but
i
do
think
he
was
a
criminal
i
mean
i
think
it
was
somebody
who
meant
harm
to
my
husband
think
maybe
the
shot
was
meant
for
stone
looked
at
her
sharply
and
said
please
wheeler
be
honest
with
me
whatever
you
may
pretend
to
others
are
you
not
springing
that
theory
in
a
further
attempt
to
direct
suspicion
away
from
wheeler
she
gave
a
gesture
of
helplessness
i
see
i
can
hide
nothing
from
you
stone
you
are
may
there
not
be
a
chance
that
it
is
a
true
theory
after
all
possibly
if
we
can
find
any
hint
of
the
bugler
s
identity
keefe
says
find
the
bugler
and
you
ve
found
the
i
know
he
does
but
keefe
i
anxious
to
direct
suspicion
away
from
the
wheeler
family
you
see
keefe
is
in
love
with
my
as
who
isn
t
all
the
young
men
fall
down
before
her
charms
it
is
so
although
she
is
engaged
to
allen
both
keefe
and
sam
appleby
are
hopeful
of
yet
winning
her
regard
to
me
it
is
not
surprising
for
i
think
maida
the
very
flower
of
lovely
girlhood
but
i
also
think
those
men
should
recognize
jeffrey
allen
s
rights
and
cease
paying
maida
such
definite
it
is
hard
to
repress
an
ardent
admirer
stone
admitted
and
as
you
say
that
is
probably
keefe
s
intent
in
insisting
on
the
finding
of
the
bugler
you
do
not
then
believe
in
your
old
legend
i
do
and
i
don
t
my
mind
has
a
tendency
to
revere
and
love
the
old
traditions
of
my
family
but
when
it
comes
to
real
belief
i
can
t
say
i
am
willing
to
stand
by
them
yet
where
else
can
we
look
for
a
than
my
own
people
please
tell
me
just
what
you
saw
when
you
looked
into
the
den
immediately
after
you
heard
the
shot
you
must
realize
how
important
this
testimony
i
do
was
the
solemn
reply
i
saw
as
i
told
you
both
my
husband
and
my
daughter
looking
at
appleby
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
i
did
not
know
then
that
he
was
dead
but
he
must
have
been
dead
or
dying
the
doctors
said
the
death
was
practically
and
from
their
attitude
or
their
facial
expression
could
you
assume
either
your
husband
or
daughter
to
have
been
the
guilty
one
i
can
only
say
they
both
looked
stunned
and
horrified
just
as
one
would
expect
them
to
look
on
the
occasion
of
witnessing
a
horrible
whether
they
were
responsible
for
it
or
not
yes
but
i
m
not
sure
the
attitude
would
have
been
different
in
the
case
of
a
criminal
or
a
witness
i
mean
the
fright
and
horror
i
saw
on
their
faces
would
be
the
same
if
they
had
committed
a
crime
or
had
seen
it
stone
considered
this
you
may
be
right
he
said
i
daresay
absolute
horror
would
fill
the
soul
in
either
case
and
would
produce
much
the
same
effect
in
appearance
now
let
us
suppose
for
a
moment
that
one
or
other
of
the
two
did
do
the
a
moment
as
wheeler
swayed
uncertainly
in
her
chair
don
t
faint
i
m
supposing
this
only
in
the
interests
of
you
and
yours
suppose
i
say
that
either
wheeler
or
miss
wheeler
had
fired
the
they
have
both
confessed
to
would
you
assume
from
their
appearance
had
done
it
controlling
herself
by
a
strong
effort
sara
wheeler
answered
steadily
i
could
not
say
honestly
to
my
startled
eyes
they
seemed
equally
horrified
and
of
course
they
would
you
see
wheeler
the
fact
that
they
both
confess
it
makes
it
look
as
if
one
of
them
did
do
it
and
the
other
having
witnessed
the
deed
takes
over
the
blame
to
save
the
guilty
one
this
sounds
harsh
but
we
have
to
face
the
facts
then
if
we
can
get
more
or
different
facts
so
much
the
you
re
suggesting
then
that
one
of
my
people
did
do
it
and
the
other
saw
it
done
i
m
suggesting
that
that
might
be
the
truth
and
so
far
as
we
can
see
now
is
the
most
apparent
solution
but
i
m
not
saying
it
is
the
truth
nor
shall
i
relax
my
efforts
to
find
another
answer
to
our
problem
and
i
want
to
tell
you
that
you
have
helped
materially
by
withdrawing
your
own
confession
every
step
i
can
take
toward
the
truth
is
helpful
you
have
lessened
the
suspects
from
three
to
two
now
if
i
can
eliminate
another
we
will
have
but
one
and
if
i
can
clear
that
one
we
shall
have
to
look
that
is
specious
argument
stone
and
sara
wheeler
fixed
her
large
sad
eyes
upon
his
face
for
if
you
succeeded
in
elimination
of
one
of
the
two
it
may
be
you
can
not
eliminate
the
and
then
your
loving
perjuries
will
be
useless
true
but
i
must
do
my
that
means
my
duty
to
you
all
i
may
tell
you
that
appleby
who
employed
me
asked
me
to
find
a
criminal
outside
of
your
family
whether
the
real
one
or
he
put
it
that
way
he
did
and
while
i
do
want
to
find
the
outside
criminal
i
can
t
find
him
if
he
doesn
t
of
course
not
i
daresay
i
shall
regret
what
i
ve
told
you
but
you
couldn
t
help
it
i
know
don
t
worry
wheeler
if
you
ve
no
great
faith
in
me
try
to
have
a
hopeful
trust
and
i
assure
you
i
will
not
betray
well
mcguire
stone
said
to
his
adoring
satellite
a
little
later
there
s
one
mother
wheeler
yes
you
young
scamp
how
did
you
know
saw
you
hobnobbing
with
being
took
with
a
sudden
attack
of
the
anyhow
two
of
got
to
cave
in
you
can
ferret
out
which
of
em
is
george
washingtons
and
which
isn
well
here
s
the
way
it
seems
to
stand
now
mind
i
only
say
seems
to
the
father
and
of
whom
confess
to
the
shooting
were
seen
in
the
room
immediately
after
the
event
now
they
were
on
opposite
sides
of
the
room
the
victim
being
about
midway
between
them
consequently
if
one
shot
the
other
was
witness
thereto
and
owing
to
the
deep
devotion
obtaining
between
them
either
father
or
daughter
would
confess
to
the
crime
to
save
the
then
fibsy
summed
up
mr
wheeler
and
maida
don
t
suspect
each
other
one
did
it
and
both
know
which
well
put
now
which
is
which
more
likely
the
girl
did
the
shooting
she
s
awful
impulsive
awful
high
strung
and
awful
fond
of
her
father
say
the
old
appleby
gentleman
was
beratin
and
oratin
and
iratin
against
friend
wheeler
and
say
he
went
a
leetle
too
far
for
miss
maida
to
stand
and
say
she
had
that
new
secret
or
whatever
it
is
that
s
eatin
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
overly
if
she
up
and
shot
the
having
held
the
pistol
in
readiness
not
nec
ess
rily
she
coulda
sprung
across
the
room
lifted
the
weapon
from
its
customed
place
in
the
drawer
and
fired
all
in
a
fleetin
instant
o
time
and
she
s
the
girl
to
do
it
that
maida
now
she
could
do
anything
and
she
loves
the
old
man
enough
to
do
anything
touch
and
s
what
she
is
especially
go
well
all
right
yet
maybe
it
was
the
other
way
maybe
wheeler
at
the
end
of
his
patience
and
knowing
the
secret
whatever
it
may
be
flung
away
discretion
and
grabbed
up
his
own
pistol
and
coulda
been
stone
coulda
lean
to
the
maida
theory
maida
for
mine
first
last
and
all
the
for
an
admirer
of
hers
and
you
re
not
by
yourself
in
that
you
seem
cheerfully
willing
to
subscribe
to
her
well
i
ain
t
but
i
do
want
to
get
the
truth
as
to
the
three
wheelers
and
once
i
get
it
fastened
on
the
lovely
maida
i
ll
set
to
work
to
get
it
off
again
but
i
ll
know
where
i
m
and
suppose
we
fasten
it
on
the
lovely
daniel
that
s
a
serious
proposition
stone
for
if
he
did
it
he
did
it
and
if
maida
did
didn
t
do
it
see
not
very
clearly
but
never
mind
you
needn
t
expound
it
doesn
t
interest
fibsy
looked
comically
chagrined
as
he
often
did
when
stone
scorned
his
ideas
but
he
said
nothing
except
orders
sir
yes
terence
hunt
up
rachel
the
maid
and
find
out
all
she
knows
use
your
phenomenal
powers
of
enchantment
and
make
her
come
tis
the
same
as
done
sir
declared
the
boy
and
he
departed
at
once
in
search
of
rachel
he
sauntered
out
of
the
north
door
and
took
a
roundabout
way
to
the
kitchen
quarters
finally
he
found
the
cook
and
putting
on
his
best
and
most
endearing
little
boy
effects
he
appealed
for
something
to
eat
not
but
what
i
m
well
treated
at
the
table
he
said
but
you
know
what
boys
i
do
that
and
the
woman
furnished
him
with
liberal
pieces
of
pie
and
cake
great
said
fibsy
eating
the
last
crumb
as
he
guilefully
complimented
her
culinary
skill
and
now
i
ve
got
to
find
a
person
name
o
rachel
where
might
she
be
she
might
be
most
anywhere
but
she
isn
t
anywhere
was
the
cryptic
reply
why
for
well
she
s
plain
disappeared
if
you
know
what
that
vamoosed
skipped
faded
slid
oozed
out
yes
all
those
anyway
she
isn
t
on
the
since
when
why
i
saw
her
last
about
two
hours
ago
then
when
wheeler
wanted
her
she
wasn
t
to
be
and
hasn
t
sence
ben
sane
just
so
and
as
you
are
part
and
parcel
of
that
detective
layout
that
s
infestin
the
house
an
grounds
i
wish
you
d
find
the
why
why
what
langwitch
why
call
her
names
she
s
a
caution
get
along
now
and
if
you
can
t
find
her
at
least
you
can
quit
botherin
all
right
but
tell
me
this
before
we
part
did
she
confide
to
your
willin
ears
anything
about
the
murder
uncanny
you
are
lad
how
d
you
guess
it
i
m
a
limb
of
satan
what
did
she
tell
you
and
when
only
this
morning
early
before
she
flew
couldn
t
very
well
have
told
you
after
she
no
impidence
now
well
she
told
me
that
the
night
of
the
murder
as
she
ran
from
here
to
the
garage
she
saw
on
the
south
veranda
a
man
with
a
bugle
pipe
a
pipe
dream
i
dunno
but
she
told
it
like
gospel
just
what
did
she
say
said
she
saw
a
live
man
no
phantom
foolishness
on
the
south
veranda
and
he
carried
a
did
he
play
on
it
no
just
carried
it
like
but
she
says
he
musta
been
the
murderer
and
by
the
same
token
it
s
the
man
i
saw
oho
you
saw
him
too
as
i
told
your
master
i
saw
him
but
not
plain
as
i
ran
along
to
the
fire
rachel
now
she
saw
him
plain
so
he
musta
been
there
well
belike
he
was
the
murderer
and
that
sets
my
people
important
if
true
but
are
you
both
sure
and
why
oh
why
does
the
valuable
rachel
choose
this
time
to
vanish
won
t
she
come
back
who
knows
she
didn
t
take
any
how
did
she
go
nobody
knows
she
walked
of
then
she
couldn
t
have
gone
oh
well
she
could
walk
to
the
railway
station
it
s
only
a
fairish
tramp
but
did
she
go
i
ask
and
i
don
t
know
but
i
suppose
it
was
because
she
didn
t
want
to
be
questioned
about
the
man
who
what
you
didn
t
say
she
saw
him
shoot
yes
i
did
or
i
meant
to
anyway
that
s
what
rachel
said
the
man
with
the
bugle
shot
through
the
window
and
that
s
what
killed
oh
come
now
this
is
too
big
a
yarn
to
be
true
especially
when
the
yarner
lights
out
at
once
after
telling
it
well
rachel
has
her
faults
but
i
never
knew
her
to
lie
and
if
it
was
the
man
i
that
proves
at
least
there
was
a
man
but
you
didn
t
see
him
but
i
saw
then
he
must
be
reckoned
with
now
cookie
dear
we
find
rachel
we
must
do
you
hear
you
help
me
and
i
bet
we
ll
get
but
i
ve
no
idea
where
she
of
course
you
haven
t
but
think
has
she
any
friends
or
relatives
nearby
not
are
there
any
trains
about
the
time
she
left
i
don
t
know
what
time
she
left
but
there
s
been
no
train
since
and
i
doubt
she
was
in
time
for
she
took
no
luggage
no
i
ll
vouch
for
then
she
s
likely
in
the
neighborhood
is
there
any
inn
or
place
she
could
get
a
room
and
board
oh
land
she
hasn
t
gone
away
to
stay
she
s
scart
at
something
most
likely
and
she
ll
be
back
by
she
may
and
she
may
not
she
must
be
found
wait
has
she
a
lover
well
they
do
say
fulton
the
chauffeur
is
sweet
on
her
but
i
never
noticed
it
who
said
he
was
mostly
she
said
it
she
ought
to
know
me
for
fulton
cookie
for
the
nonce
and
waving
a
smiling
farewell
fibsy
went
off
toward
the
garage
chapter
xiv
rachel
s
story
hello
fult
fibsy
sang
out
gaily
to
the
chauffeur
and
received
a
pleasant
response
for
few
could
resist
the
contagious
smile
of
the
round
freckled
face
of
the
boy
hello
fibsy
the
other
returned
how
you
getting
on
with
your
detective
work
fine
but
i
want
a
little
help
from
me
i
don
t
know
anything
about
well
then
tell
me
what
you
don
t
know
that
fire
now
here
in
the
garage
the
night
of
the
murder
did
you
ever
find
out
how
it
started
fulton
s
face
took
on
a
perplexed
look
and
he
said
no
we
didn
it
s
a
queer
thing
it
must
have
been
started
by
some
one
purposely
for
there
s
no
way
it
could
have
come
about
by
spontaneous
combustion
whatever
made
you
think
of
that
and
it
couldn
t
have
been
from
old
paint
rags
or
such
for
there
s
nothing
like
that
about
here
s
what
i
fulton
produced
a
small
bottle
it
was
empty
and
had
no
label
or
stopper
and
fibsy
looked
at
it
blankly
what
is
it
he
asked
never
see
one
like
it
no
have
you
yes
i
have
i
was
in
the
war
and
bottles
like
that
contained
acid
which
when
combined
with
another
acid
caused
spontaneous
well
they
used
to
saturate
some
cloth
or
old
clothes
with
the
other
acid
and
throw
them
about
then
when
the
time
came
they
threw
a
little
bottle
like
that
filled
with
acid
and
with
only
a
paper
stopper
in
among
the
clothes
the
acid
slowly
ate
out
the
paper
stopper
and
then
the
two
acids
caused
combustion
so
by
the
time
the
fire
started
the
man
who
was
responsible
for
it
was
far
away
from
the
whew
and
you
think
that
happened
here
there
s
the
bottle
the
fire
began
in
appleby
s
car
two
coats
and
a
rug
were
mightn
t
they
have
been
sprinkled
with
the
other
of
course
that
s
what
happened
why
haven
t
you
told
this
before
i
only
found
the
bottle
this
morning
it
had
been
kicked
under
a
bench
and
the
sweeper
found
it
then
i
fell
for
it
s
the
very
same
sort
of
bottle
i
saw
used
over
there
somebody
who
knew
that
trick
did
and
whoever
did
it
is
either
appleby
s
murderer
or
an
you
think
the
two
crimes
are
connected
then
haven
t
a
doubt
of
it
you
re
a
clever
chap
fulton
to
dope
this
well
there
was
no
other
explanation
anything
else
hinted
at
carelessness
of
my
management
of
this
place
and
that
hurt
my
pride
for
i
like
to
think
this
garage
the
pink
of
perfection
as
to
cleanliness
and
mr
wheeler
is
fortunate
in
having
such
a
man
as
you
now
one
more
thing
fulton
where
is
rachel
rachel
yes
your
blush
gives
you
away
if
you
know
where
she
is
tell
me
if
she
s
done
nothing
wrong
it
can
do
no
harm
to
find
her
if
she
done
anything
wrong
she
be
i
don
t
know
where
she
is
call
me
mcguire
and
if
you
don
t
know
where
she
is
you
know
something
about
her
disappearance
when
did
she
go
away
i
saw
her
last
night
she
said
nothing
about
going
away
but
she
seemed
nervous
and
worried
and
i
couldn
t
say
anything
to
please
can
t
you
form
any
idea
of
where
she
might
have
gone
be
frank
fulton
for
much
depends
on
getting
hold
of
that
i
can
only
say
i
ve
no
idea
where
she
is
but
she
may
communicate
with
me
in
that
in
that
case
let
me
know
at
once
fibsy
commanded
and
having
learned
all
he
could
there
he
went
off
to
think
up
some
other
means
of
finding
the
lost
rachel
meantime
sam
appleby
was
taking
his
departure
i
have
to
go
he
said
in
response
to
the
wheelers
invitation
to
tarry
longer
because
keefe
is
coming
down
one
of
us
ought
to
be
in
father
s
office
all
the
time
now
there
s
so
much
to
attend
why
is
keefe
coming
here
asked
maida
mr
stone
wants
to
see
him
appleby
informed
her
you
know
keefe
is
more
or
less
of
a
detective
himself
and
stone
thinks
he
may
be
helpful
in
finding
the
criminal
miss
lane
is
coming
also
she
begged
to
mostly
i
think
because
she
took
such
a
liking
to
i
liked
her
too
returned
maida
she
s
a
funny
girl
but
a
sincere
thorough
yes
she
is
well
they
ll
only
stay
over
a
day
or
two
i
can
t
spare
them
longer
of
course
they
may
be
of
help
to
stone
and
they
may
not
but
i
don
t
want
to
miss
a
trick
in
this
investigation
what
a
queer
little
chap
that
boy
of
stone
s
is
fibsy
and
maida
smiled
yes
he
s
a
case
and
he
s
my
devoted
as
who
isn
t
exclaimed
appleby
oh
maida
do
give
me
a
little
encouragement
after
this
awful
business
is
all
over
mayn
t
i
come
back
with
a
hope
that
you
ll
smile
on
me
don
t
talk
that
way
sam
you
know
i
m
engaged
to
oh
no
you
re
not
i
mean
it
can
be
possible
for
you
to
change
your
mind
girls
are
often
engaged
to
several
men
before
they
i
m
not
that
sort
and
maida
smiled
a
little
sadly
be
that
sort
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
may
be
openly
accused
of
crime
at
any
moment
and
a
crime
that
hits
you
pretty
don
t
say
such
things
dear
neither
you
nor
any
of
your
people
are
responsible
for
the
dreadful
thing
that
happened
to
if
you
are
i
never
want
to
know
it
and
i
do
want
you
maida
hush
sam
i
won
t
listen
to
anything
like
that
from
not
now
but
later
on
he
urged
tell
me
that
i
may
come
back
maida
of
course
you
may
come
here
whenever
you
like
but
i
hold
out
no
hope
of
the
sort
you
ask
i
shall
hope
all
the
same
i
d
die
if
i
didn
t
maida
for
this
he
went
away
to
the
train
and
later
came
keefe
and
genevieve
lane
oh
the
girl
cried
i
m
so
glad
to
be
back
here
again
maida
my
but
you
re
prettier
than
ever
if
you
d
only
touch
up
those
pale
a
little
let
she
opened
her
vanity
box
and
was
about
to
apply
a
touch
of
rouge
but
maida
sprang
away
from
her
no
no
genevieve
i
never
use
silly
girl
you
don
t
deserve
the
beauty
nature
gave
you
if
you
re
not
willing
to
help
it
along
a
little
yourself
how
do
you
do
wheeler
and
wheeler
she
greeted
them
prettily
and
keefe
too
exchanged
greetings
with
the
family
anything
being
done
he
asked
finally
has
stone
discovered
anything
of
importance
nothing
very
definite
i
fear
returned
daniel
wheeler
he
spoke
wearily
and
almost
despairingly
anxiety
and
worry
had
aged
him
even
in
the
last
few
days
i
do
hope
keefe
that
you
can
be
of
assistance
you
have
a
keen
eye
for
details
and
may
know
or
remember
some
points
that
escaped
our
i
m
hoping
i
can
help
keefe
returned
with
a
serious
face
can
i
see
stone
shortly
yes
now
come
along
into
the
den
he
s
in
the
two
men
went
to
the
den
where
stone
and
fibsy
were
in
deep
consultation
very
glad
to
see
you
keefe
fleming
stone
acknowledged
the
introduction
this
is
mcguire
my
young
assistant
you
may
speak
frankly
before
if
i
have
anything
to
speak
said
keefe
i
don
t
really
know
anything
i
haven
t
told
but
i
may
remind
wheeler
of
some
points
he
has
well
let
s
talk
it
all
over
stone
suggested
and
they
did
keefe
was
greatly
surprised
and
impressed
by
the
story
of
the
cook
s
having
seen
a
man
on
the
south
veranda
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
but
she
didn
t
see
him
clearly
fibsy
added
couldn
t
she
describe
him
no
she
didn
t
see
him
plain
enough
but
the
maid
rachel
told
cook
that
she
saw
the
man
too
and
that
he
carried
a
bugle
cook
didn
t
see
the
naturally
not
if
she
only
saw
the
man
vaguely
said
wheeler
but
it
begins
to
look
as
if
there
must
have
been
a
man
there
and
if
so
he
may
have
been
the
let
us
hope
said
keefe
earnestly
now
can
you
find
this
man
stone
we
ve
got
to
find
him
stone
returned
whether
we
can
or
not
it
s
really
a
baffling
case
i
think
we
ve
discovered
the
origin
of
the
fire
in
the
he
told
the
story
that
fibsy
had
learned
from
the
chauffeur
and
keefe
was
greatly
interested
what
are
the
acids
he
asked
i
don
t
know
the
exact
names
stone
admitted
but
they
are
of
just
such
powers
as
fulton
described
and
the
thing
is
plausible
here
s
the
he
offered
the
little
vial
for
inspection
and
keefe
looked
at
it
with
some
curiosity
the
theory
being
he
said
that
the
murderer
first
arranged
for
a
fire
in
our
appleby
s
then
waited
for
the
fire
to
come
off
as
planned
then
at
the
moment
of
greatest
excitement
he
being
probably
the
man
the
servants
through
the
bay
window
and
killed
appleby
you
were
fortunate
miss
maida
that
you
weren
t
hit
first
oh
i
was
in
no
danger
i
sat
well
back
in
the
and
over
to
one
side
out
of
range
of
a
shot
from
outside
and
too
keefe
i
can
scarcely
discuss
this
matter
of
the
shot
from
outside
as
i
am
myself
the
confessed
confessing
only
to
save
me
from
suspicion
said
her
father
with
an
affectionate
glance
but
it
won
t
do
any
good
dear
i
take
the
burden
of
the
crime
and
i
own
up
that
i
did
it
this
man
on
the
indeed
there
was
such
a
one
may
have
been
any
of
the
men
servants
about
the
place
startled
by
the
cry
of
fire
and
running
to
assure
himself
of
the
safety
of
the
house
and
family
he
doubtless
hesitates
to
divulge
his
identity
lest
he
be
suspected
of
that
s
all
right
declared
fibsy
but
if
it
was
one
of
your
men
he
d
own
up
by
this
time
he
d
know
he
wouldn
t
be
suspected
of
shooting
appleby
why
should
he
do
it
why
should
anybody
do
it
except
myself
asked
dan
wheeler
not
all
the
detectives
in
the
world
can
find
any
one
else
with
a
motive
and
opportunity
the
fact
that
both
my
wife
and
daughter
tried
to
take
the
crime
off
my
shoulders
only
makes
me
more
determined
to
tell
the
but
you
re
not
telling
the
truth
dad
and
maida
looked
at
him
you
know
i
did
know
i
had
threatened
to
do
know
i
felt
i
just
could
not
stand
appleby
s
oppression
of
you
another
day
and
so
go
on
miss
wheeler
urged
stone
and
so
did
you
do
i
ran
across
the
den
to
the
drawer
where
father
keeps
his
pistol
i
took
it
and
i
ran
back
to
the
what
did
you
do
with
the
pistol
threw
it
out
of
the
toward
the
right
or
left
why
i
don
t
try
to
think
stand
up
there
now
and
remember
which
way
you
flung
reluctantly
maida
went
to
the
bay
window
and
stood
there
thinking
i
don
t
know
she
said
at
last
i
can
t
it
doesn
t
matter
said
keefe
i
think
we
can
prove
that
it
was
none
of
the
wheelers
but
there
was
a
man
an
intruder
on
the
veranda
who
shot
even
if
we
never
find
out
his
identity
we
may
prove
that
he
was
really
there
where
is
this
maid
who
saw
him
clearly
that
her
name
that
s
a
pretty
thing
too
fibsy
spoke
up
she
has
flew
the
gone
where
keefe
showed
his
disappointment
nobody
knows
where
she
just
simply
lit
out
even
her
lover
doesn
t
know
where
she
who
is
her
lover
fulton
the
chauffeur
he
s
just
about
crazy
over
her
oh
she
ll
return
surmised
stone
she
became
frightened
at
something
and
ran
off
i
think
she
ll
come
back
if
not
we
ll
have
to
give
chase
we
must
find
her
as
she
s
the
principal
witness
of
the
man
on
the
veranda
cook
is
not
so
sure
about
who
could
he
have
been
keefe
said
doubtless
some
enemy
of
appleby
in
no
way
connected
with
the
probably
agreed
stone
we
found
the
pistol
you
know
keefe
remarked
fibsy
you
did
well
you
have
made
progress
where
was
it
in
the
fern
bed
not
far
from
the
veranda
just
where
the
man
would
have
thrown
it
exclaimed
keefe
or
where
i
threw
it
put
in
daniel
wheeler
i
d
like
to
see
the
exact
place
it
was
found
keefe
said
come
on
i
ll
show
you
offered
fibsy
and
the
two
started
away
together
here
you
are
and
fibsy
showed
the
bed
of
ferns
which
growing
closely
together
made
a
dense
hiding
place
a
wonder
you
ever
found
it
said
keefe
how
d
you
happen
to
oh
i
just
snooped
around
till
i
came
to
it
i
says
to
myself
either
the
murderer
flung
it
away
or
he
didn
t
if
he
did
why
it
must
be
somewheres
and
it
i
see
and
does
stone
think
the
finding
of
it
here
points
to
either
of
the
wheelers
not
necess
rily
you
see
if
the
man
we
re
looking
for
did
the
shooting
he
s
the
one
who
threw
the
pistol
in
this
here
fern
bed
and
you
know
yourself
it
s
more
likely
a
man
threw
this
farther
than
a
miss
wheeler
is
i
know
but
i
m
convinced
that
miss
wheeler
didn
t
do
the
deed
ain
t
you
oh
i
can
t
think
she
did
it
of
course
but
it
s
all
very
not
mysterious
a
bit
it
s
hard
sleddin
but
there
ain
t
much
mystery
about
it
why
look
if
either
the
father
or
daughter
did
it
they
both
know
which
one
it
was
therefore
one
is
telling
the
truth
and
one
isn
t
it
won
t
be
hard
to
find
out
which
is
which
but
stone
he
s
trying
to
find
some
one
that
ll
let
the
wheelers
both
oh
that
s
his
idea
and
a
mighty
good
one
i
ll
help
all
i
can
of
course
the
thing
to
do
is
to
trace
the
oh
it
was
wheeler
s
pistol
all
it
was
keefe
looked
dismayed
then
how
can
we
suspect
an
outsider
well
he
could
have
stolen
wheeler
s
pistol
for
the
purpose
of
casting
suspicion
on
yes
that
s
so
now
to
find
that
oh
do
find
her
maida
cried
overhearing
the
remark
as
she
and
genevieve
crossed
the
lawn
toward
keefe
and
fibsy
the
lad
had
not
yet
seen
miss
lane
and
he
frankly
admired
her
at
once
perhaps
a
sympathetic
chord
was
struck
by
the
similarity
of
their
natures
perhaps
they
intuitively
recognized
each
other
s
gay
impudence
for
they
engaged
in
a
clash
of
words
that
immediately
made
them
friends
maybe
rachel
d
come
back
if
she
knew
you
were
here
he
said
i
m
sure
she
d
admire
to
wait
on
such
a
pretty
just
tell
her
that
you
saw
me
genevieve
said
and
i
ll
be
glad
to
have
her
back
she
s
a
ladies
oh
then
she
only
waits
on
ladies
yes
that
s
why
she
s
so
fond
of
me
do
hunt
her
well
cutie
just
for
you
i
ll
do
that
same
where
shall
i
go
to
look
for
her
how
should
i
know
but
you
keep
watch
of
fulton
and
i
ll
bet
he
gets
some
word
from
yes
they
re
sweethearts
now
how
do
sweethearts
get
word
to
each
other
you
ought
to
know
all
about
i
don
t
said
genevieve
demurely
pshaw
now
that
s
too
bad
want
me
to
teach
you
you
don
t
saunter
away
with
me
then
and
the
saucy
boy
led
miss
lane
off
for
a
stroll
round
the
grounds
honest
now
do
you
want
to
help
he
asked
yes
i
do
she
asserted
i
m
downright
fond
of
maida
and
though
i
know
she
didn
t
do
it
yet
she
and
her
father
will
be
suspected
unless
we
can
find
this
other
person
and
the
only
way
to
get
a
line
on
him
seems
to
be
through
rachel
why
do
you
suppose
she
ran
away
can
t
imagine
don
t
see
how
she
could
get
no
what
would
scare
her
i
think
she
s
at
some
neighbor
let
s
you
and
me
go
to
all
the
neighbors
and
all
right
we
ll
go
in
the
wheelers
little
car
fulton
will
take
don
t
we
get
permission
nixy
they
might
say
no
by
mistake
for
a
yes
come
ll
just
hook
to
the
garage
they
went
and
easily
persuaded
fulton
to
take
them
around
to
some
of
the
neighboring
houses
and
at
the
third
one
they
visited
they
found
rachel
a
friend
of
hers
was
a
maid
there
and
she
had
taken
rachel
in
for
a
few
days
why
did
you
run
off
queried
fulton
oh
i
don
t
know
and
rachel
shuddered
it
all
got
on
my
nerves
who
s
over
there
now
just
the
family
and
the
detectives
and
keefe
fulton
answered
will
you
come
home
she
will
fibsy
answered
for
her
she
will
get
right
into
this
car
and
go
at
the
name
of
the
law
he
added
sternly
as
rachel
seemed
undecided
fibsy
often
used
this
phrase
and
delivered
in
an
tone
it
was
usually
effective
rachel
did
get
into
the
car
and
they
returned
to
sycamore
lodge
in
triumph
good
work
fibs
stone
nodded
his
approval
now
rachel
sit
right
down
here
on
the
veranda
and
tell
us
about
that
man
you
the
girl
was
clearly
frightened
and
her
voice
trembled
but
she
tried
to
tell
her
story
there
s
nothing
to
fear
curtis
keefe
said
kindly
just
tell
slowly
and
simply
the
story
of
your
seeing
the
man
and
then
you
may
be
she
gave
him
a
grateful
look
and
seemed
to
take
courage
well
i
was
passing
the
coming
from
where
and
going
where
interrupted
stone
speaking
gently
why
was
coming
from
where
you
had
been
talking
to
fulton
yes
all
right
go
and
i
was
to
go
up
to
wheeler
s
room
i
thought
she
might
want
me
and
as
i
went
by
the
veranda
i
saw
the
man
he
was
a
big
man
and
he
carried
a
he
didn
t
blow
on
it
no
sir
just
waved
it
about
you
didn
t
see
that
he
had
a
pistol
couldn
t
say
of
course
you
couldn
t
said
keefe
men
with
pistols
don
t
brandish
them
until
they
get
ready
to
but
you
saw
this
man
shoot
went
on
stone
yes
sir
rachel
said
i
saw
him
shoot
through
the
bay
window
and
then
i
ran
whereupon
she
repeated
the
action
at
the
conclusion
of
her
statement
and
hurried
away
humph
said
fleming
stone
chapter
xv
the
awful
truth
well
fibs
said
stone
as
the
two
sat
alone
in
conclave
what
about
rachel
s
story
you
know
stone
how
i
hate
to
doubt
a
lady
s
word
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
the
fair
rachel
you
think
so
too
eh
and
just
why
under
orders
she
was
coached
in
her
part
told
exactly
what
to
by
whom
oh
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
you
re
just
leading
me
on
well
he
coached
her
all
right
and
she
got
scared
before
the
performance
came
off
and
that
s
why
she
ran
yes
i
agree
to
all
that
keefe
of
course
being
the
yessir
he
doing
it
to
save
the
wheelers
you
see
he
s
so
desperately
in
love
with
miss
maida
that
it
sort
of
blinds
his
judgment
and
just
how
well
you
know
his
is
love
at
first
look
here
terence
you
know
a
great
deal
about
yessir
comes
natural
to
me
i
m
a
born
lover
i
had
much
experience
not
yet
but
my
day
s
coming
well
never
mind
get
back
to
friend
keefe
here
s
the
way
it
is
miss
wheeler
is
sort
of
engaged
to
allen
and
yet
the
matter
isn
t
quite
settled
either
i
get
that
from
the
to
gossip
but
all
s
fair
in
love
and
sleuthing
now
keefe
comes
along
sees
the
lovely
maida
and
zip
his
heart
is
cracked
all
might
yet
be
well
but
for
the
wily
genevieve
she
has
her
cap
set
for
keefe
and
he
knows
it
and
was
satisfied
it
should
be
so
till
he
saw
miss
wheeler
now
the
fat
s
in
the
fire
and
no
pitch
you
do
pick
up
a
lot
of
general
it
s
necess
ry
the
nodded
emphatically
these
sidelights
often
point
the
way
to
the
great
and
shinin
truth
for
don
t
you
see
keefe
being
so
gone
on
miss
maida
naturally
doesn
t
want
her
or
her
people
suspected
of
this
if
one
of
them
is
guilty
so
he
fixes
up
a
story
about
a
bugler
the
south
veranda
this
man
he
argues
did
the
shooting
he
gets
must
have
some
hold
on
her
bribery
wouldn
t
be
he
fair
crams
the
bugler
yarn
down
her
throat
and
orders
her
to
recite
it
as
gospel
then
she
gets
scared
and
runs
exactly
you
see
it
that
way
don
t
you
stone
the
earnest
little
face
looked
up
to
the
master
terence
mcguire
was
developing
a
wonderful
gift
for
psychological
detective
work
and
sometimes
he
let
his
imagination
run
away
with
him
in
such
cases
stone
tripped
him
up
and
turned
him
back
to
the
right
track
both
had
an
inkling
that
the
day
might
eventually
come
when
stone
would
retire
and
mcguire
would
reign
in
his
stead
but
this
was
as
yet
merely
a
dream
and
at
present
they
worked
together
in
unison
and
harmony
yes
least
i
see
it
may
have
been
that
way
but
it
s
a
big
order
to
put
i
know
but
he
s
a
big
man
i
mean
a
man
of
big
notions
and
projects
anybody
can
see
that
now
he
s
awful
anxious
miss
wheeler
and
wheeler
shall
be
cleared
of
all
s
if
he
thinks
one
of
em
is
guilty
he
doesn
t
consider
guess
nobody
does
probably
not
go
well
so
keefie
he
thinks
if
he
can
get
this
bugler
person
guaranteed
by
a
reliable
and
responsible
of
course
rachel
would
seem
to
keefe
thinks
he
s
got
the
wheelers
cleared
now
rachel
getting
cold
feet
about
it
all
goes
back
on
i
could
see
it
in
his
face
yes
he
looked
decidedly
annoyed
at
rachel
s
failure
of
a
convincing
he
did
so
now
stone
even
if
he
bolsters
up
rachel
s
story
or
gets
her
to
tell
it
more
know
you
and
i
that
it
isn
t
true
there
wasn
t
any
man
on
the
south
sure
terence
yessir
i
m
pretty
sure
for
what
became
of
him
where
did
he
vanish
to
who
was
he
there
never
was
any
mean
as
a
murderer
the
piper
who
piped
some
nights
previous
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
sure
terence
oh
come
now
was
sure
till
you
say
that
at
me
so
dubious
then
i
m
not
so
well
go
on
with
your
theory
and
let
s
see
where
you
come
out
you
may
be
on
the
right
track
after
all
i
m
not
sure
of
many
points
myself
all
right
to
my
mind
it
comes
back
to
a
between
miss
maida
and
her
father
with
the
odds
in
favor
of
the
old
gentleman
agree
i
might
if
i
understood
your
english
the
odds
in
favor
of
wheeler
indicating
his
guilt
or
innocence
his
guilt
i
meant
stone
i
can
t
think
that
sweet
young
lady
would
do
it
and
this
isn
t
because
she
is
a
sweet
young
lady
but
because
it
isn
t
hardly
plausible
that
she
s
put
the
thing
over
even
though
she
was
willing
enough
to
do
it
seems
so
to
me
too
but
we
can
t
bank
on
that
maida
wheeler
is
a
very
impulsive
girl
very
vigorous
and
athletic
and
very
devoted
to
her
father
she
worships
him
and
she
has
been
known
to
say
she
would
willingly
kill
old
appleby
these
things
must
be
remembered
that
s
so
but
i
ve
noticed
that
when
folks
threaten
to
kill
people
they
most
generally
don
t
do
i
ve
also
noticed
that
but
striking
out
maida
s
name
leaves
us
only
well
ain
t
he
the
one
ain
t
he
the
oppressed
victim
who
at
last
has
opportunity
and
who
is
goaded
to
the
point
of
desperation
by
the
arguments
of
his
enemy
you
grow
oratorical
but
i
admit
you
have
an
course
i
have
now
say
we
ve
got
to
choose
between
miss
wheeler
and
wheeler
how
do
we
go
about
it
how
why
we
find
out
how
appleby
was
sitting
how
wheeler
was
facing
at
the
moment
and
also
miss
maida
s
position
then
we
find
out
the
direction
from
which
the
bullet
entered
the
body
and
then
we
can
tell
who
fired
the
i
ve
done
all
that
fibs
stone
returned
with
no
note
of
superiority
in
his
voice
i
found
out
all
those
things
and
the
result
proves
that
the
bullet
entered
appleby
s
body
from
the
direction
of
miss
maida
in
the
bay
window
and
directly
opposite
from
what
would
have
been
its
direction
if
fired
by
wheeler
from
where
he
stood
when
seen
directly
after
the
fibsy
looked
dejected
he
made
no
response
to
this
disclosure
for
a
moment
then
he
said
all
right
stone
in
that
case
i
m
going
over
to
keefe
s
side
and
i
m
going
to
hunt
up
the
a
fictitious
person
maybe
he
ain
t
so
fictitious
after
all
and
the
shook
doggedly
a
tap
at
the
door
of
stone
s
was
followed
by
a
may
i
come
in
and
the
entrance
of
daniel
wheeler
the
time
has
come
wheeler
stone
began
a
little
abruptly
to
put
all
our
cards
on
the
table
i
ve
investigated
things
pretty
thoroughly
and
though
i
m
not
all
through
with
my
quest
i
feel
as
if
i
must
know
the
truth
as
to
what
you
know
about
the
i
have
confessed
wheeler
began
but
stone
stopped
him
that
won
t
do
he
said
very
seriously
i
ve
proved
positively
that
from
where
you
stood
you
could
not
have
fired
the
shot
it
came
from
the
opposite
direction
now
it
s
useless
for
you
to
keep
up
that
pretence
of
being
the
criminal
which
i
ve
no
doubt
you
re
doing
to
shield
your
daughter
confide
in
me
wheeler
it
will
not
harm
the
god
help
me
i
must
confide
in
somebody
cried
the
desperate
man
she
did
do
it
i
saw
maida
fire
the
shot
oh
can
you
save
her
i
wouldn
t
tell
you
this
but
i
hope
you
can
help
better
if
you
know
you
d
find
it
out
of
course
i
should
now
let
us
be
strictly
truthful
you
saw
miss
maida
fire
the
pistol
yes
i
was
sitting
almost
beside
appleby
he
was
nearer
maida
than
i
was
and
she
sat
in
the
bay
window
reading
she
sits
there
much
of
the
time
and
i
m
so
accustomed
to
her
presence
that
i
don
t
even
think
about
it
we
were
talking
pretty
angrily
appleby
and
i
really
renewing
the
old
feud
and
adding
fuel
to
its
flame
with
every
word
i
suppose
maida
listening
grew
more
and
more
indignant
at
his
injustice
and
cruelty
to
terms
are
not
too
strong
she
being
of
an
impulsive
nature
even
revengeful
when
her
love
for
me
is
touched
and
i
suppose
she
somehow
possessed
herself
of
my
pistol
and
fired
you
were
not
looking
at
her
before
the
shot
oh
no
the
shot
rang
out
appleby
fell
forward
and
even
as
i
rose
to
go
to
his
aid
i
instinctively
turned
toward
the
direction
from
which
the
sound
of
the
shot
had
come
there
i
saw
maida
standing
and
frightened
but
with
a
look
of
satisfied
revenge
on
her
dear
face
i
felt
no
resentment
at
her
act
i
was
incapable
of
coherent
thought
of
any
sort
i
stepped
to
appleby
s
side
and
i
saw
at
once
that
he
was
died
instantly
i
can
not
tell
you
just
what
happened
next
it
seemed
ages
before
anybody
came
and
then
suddenly
the
room
was
full
of
people
allen
and
keefe
came
servants
gathered
about
my
wife
appeared
and
maida
was
there
i
had
a
strange
undercurrent
of
thought
that
kept
hammering
at
my
brain
to
the
effect
that
i
must
convince
everybody
that
i
did
it
to
save
my
girl
i
was
to
the
extent
of
planning
my
words
in
an
effort
to
carry
conviction
of
my
guilt
but
that
effort
so
absorbed
my
attention
that
i
gave
no
heed
to
what
happened
thank
you
wheeler
for
your
kindness
i
assure
you
you
will
not
regret
you
re
going
to
save
her
you
can
save
my
little
girl
oh
stone
i
beg
of
the
agonized
father
broke
down
completely
and
stone
said
kindly
keep
up
a
good
heart
wheeler
that
will
help
your
daughter
more
than
anything
else
you
can
do
i
assumed
that
if
one
of
you
were
guilty
the
other
was
shielding
the
criminal
but
your
story
has
straightened
out
the
tangle
lem
me
ask
something
please
broke
in
fibsy
say
wheeler
did
you
see
the
pistol
in
miss
maida
s
hands
i
can
t
say
i
did
or
didn
t
wheeler
replied
listlessly
i
looked
only
at
her
face
i
know
my
daughter
s
mind
so
well
that
i
at
once
recognized
her
expression
of
horror
mingled
with
relief
she
had
really
desired
the
death
of
her
father
s
enemy
and
she
was
glad
it
had
been
accomplished
it
s
a
terrible
thing
to
say
of
one
s
own
child
but
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
to
be
honest
with
you
stone
in
the
hope
of
your
help
i
should
have
persisted
in
my
own
story
of
guilt
had
i
not
perceived
it
was
futile
in
the
face
of
your
logic
and
knowledge
of
the
exact
you
did
wisely
but
say
nothing
to
any
one
else
for
the
present
do
not
even
talk
to
miss
maida
about
it
until
i
have
time
to
plan
our
next
step
it
is
still
a
difficult
and
a
very
delicate
case
a
single
false
move
may
queer
the
whole
you
think
then
you
can
save
do
give
a
tortured
father
a
gleam
of
hope
i
shall
do
my
best
you
know
they
rarely
if
ever
convict
a
too
miss
wheeler
had
great
provocation
about
appleby
threatened
neither
of
us
wheeler
said
that
can
t
be
well
we
ll
do
everything
we
can
you
may
depend
on
that
stone
assured
him
and
wheeler
went
away
relieved
at
the
new
turn
things
had
taken
though
also
newly
concerned
for
maida
s
safety
nice
old
chap
said
fibsy
to
stone
he
stuck
to
his
faked
yarn
as
long
as
the
sticking
was
good
and
then
he
caved
open
and
shut
case
terence
not
yet
shut
stone
now
where
do
we
go
from
here
you
go
where
you
like
boy
leave
me
to
grub
at
this
without
another
word
fibsy
left
the
room
he
well
knew
when
stone
spoke
in
that
serious
tone
that
great
thoughts
were
forming
in
that
fertile
brain
and
sooner
or
later
he
would
know
of
them
but
at
present
his
company
was
not
desired
the
boy
drifted
out
on
the
terraced
lawn
and
wandered
about
among
the
gardens
he
too
thought
but
he
could
see
no
light
ahead
s
long
as
the
old
man
saw
her
he
observed
to
himself
there
s
no
more
to
be
said
he
never
d
say
he
saw
her
shoot
if
he
hadn
t
seen
her
he
s
at
the
end
of
his
rope
and
even
if
they
acquit
the
lady
i
don
t
want
to
see
her
dragged
through
a
trial
but
where
s
any
way
of
escape
what
can
turn
up
to
contradict
a
straight
story
like
that
who
else
can
testify
except
the
who
has
just
spoken
i
wonder
if
he
realized
himself
how
conclusive
his
statement
was
but
he
trusted
in
stone
to
get
maida
off
somehow
queer
how
most
folks
think
a
detective
is
a
magician
and
can
do
the
impossible
trick
in
a
brown
study
he
walked
slowly
along
the
garden
paths
and
was
seen
by
keefe
and
maida
who
sat
under
the
big
sycamore
tree
crazy
idea
stone
bringing
that
kid
keefe
said
with
a
laugh
yes
but
he
s
a
very
bright
boy
maida
returned
i
ve
been
surprised
at
his
wise
poppycock
he
gets
off
his
speeches
with
that
funny
mixture
of
newsboy
slang
and
detective
jargon
and
you
think
they
re
cleverer
than
they
perhaps
agreed
maida
not
greatly
interested
but
what
a
strange
story
rachel
told
do
you
believe
it
keefe
yes
i
do
the
girl
was
frightened
i
think
first
at
the
information
she
tried
to
divulge
and
second
by
finding
herself
in
the
limelight
she
seems
to
be
shy
and
i
daresay
the
sudden
publicity
shook
her
nerves
but
why
shouldn
t
her
story
be
true
why
should
she
invent
all
that
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
but
it
didn
t
sound
like
whole
thing
i
mean
she
seemed
acting
a
nonsense
you
imagine
that
but
never
mind
her
i
ve
something
to
tell
you
i
mind
you
i
know
what
appleby
meant
by
the
speech
which
i
took
to
be
mr
keefe
and
the
maida
s
face
went
white
oh
no
she
cried
involuntarily
oh
no
yes
keefe
went
on
and
i
know
now
he
said
heirship
not
strange
i
misunderstood
for
the
words
are
of
the
same
then
i
had
no
reason
to
think
of
myself
in
connection
with
an
heirship
have
you
now
yes
i
have
i
ve
been
over
appleby
s
i
had
a
right
to
do
you
know
i
was
his
confidential
secretary
and
he
kept
no
secrets
from
those
he
wanted
to
keep
go
on
said
maida
calm
now
and
her
eyes
glistening
with
an
expression
of
despair
need
i
go
on
you
know
the
truth
you
know
that
i
am
the
rightful
heir
of
this
whole
place
sycamore
ridge
is
mine
and
not
your
mother
the
word
was
scarce
audible
poor
maida
felt
as
if
the
last
blow
had
fallen
she
had
seared
her
conscience
defied
her
sense
of
honor
crucified
her
very
soul
to
keep
this
dreadful
secret
from
her
parents
for
their
own
sake
and
now
all
her
efforts
were
of
no
avail
curtis
keefe
knew
that
the
great
estate
was
legally
his
and
now
her
dear
parents
would
be
turned
out
homeless
penniless
and
broken
down
by
sorrow
and
grief
even
though
he
might
allow
them
to
stay
there
they
wouldn
t
she
knew
consent
to
any
such
arrangement
she
lifted
a
blanched
strained
face
to
his
as
she
said
are
you
going
to
do
just
what
you
say
keefe
replied
drawing
closer
to
her
side
it
s
all
up
to
you
maida
dear
don
t
look
offended
surely
you
know
i
love
you
know
my
one
great
desire
is
to
make
you
my
wife
give
your
consent
say
you
will
be
mine
and
rest
assured
dearest
there
will
be
no
trouble
about
the
if
you
will
marry
me
i
will
promise
never
to
divulge
the
secret
so
long
as
either
of
your
parents
live
they
may
keep
this
place
and
besides
that
darling
i
will
guarantee
to
get
your
father
a
full
pardon
i
m
not
speaking
of
it
i
ll
tell
you
that
there
is
a
possibility
of
my
running
for
governor
myself
since
young
sam
is
voluntarily
out
of
it
but
in
any
case
i
have
influence
enough
in
certain
increased
by
knowledge
that
i
have
gleaned
here
and
there
among
the
late
appleby
s
secure
a
full
and
free
pardon
for
your
father
now
maida
girl
even
if
you
don
t
love
me
very
much
yet
can
t
you
say
yes
in
view
of
what
i
offer
you
how
can
you
torture
me
so
surely
you
know
that
i
am
engaged
to
i
didn
t
know
it
was
a
positive
anyway
his
voice
grew
hard
it
seems
to
me
that
any
one
so
solicitous
for
her
parents
welfare
and
happiness
as
you
have
shown
yourself
will
not
hesitate
at
a
step
which
means
so
much
more
than
others
you
have
oh
i
don
t
know
what
to
to
me
yes
dear
think
all
you
like
take
it
quietly
now
remember
that
a
decision
in
my
favor
means
also
a
calm
peaceful
and
happy
life
insured
to
your
parents
refusal
means
a
broken
shattered
life
a
precarious
existence
and
never
a
happy
day
for
them
again
can
you
hesitate
i
m
not
so
very
unpresentable
as
a
husband
you
may
not
love
me
now
but
you
will
i
ll
be
so
good
to
you
that
you
can
t
help
it
nor
do
i
mean
to
win
your
heart
only
by
what
i
shall
do
for
you
for
maida
dearest
love
begets
love
and
you
will
find
yourself
slowly
perhaps
but
surely
giving
me
your
heart
and
we
will
be
so
happy
is
it
yes
my
darling
the
girl
stared
at
him
her
big
brown
eyes
full
of
agony
you
forget
something
she
said
slowly
i
am
a
murderess
hush
don
t
say
that
awful
word
you
are
even
if
you
were
i
ll
prove
you
are
not

maida
if
you
ll
promise
to
marry
me
i
ll
find
the
real
you
or
your
father
but
the
real
murderer
i
ll
get
a
signed
ll
acquit
you
and
your
family
of
any
implication
in
the
deed
and
i
ll
produce
the
criminal
himself
now
will
you
say
yes
you
can
t
do
all
that
she
said
speaking
in
an
awestruck
whisper
as
if
he
had
proposed
to
perform
a
miracle
i
swear
it
then
if
you
can
do
that
you
ought
to
do
it
anyway
in
the
interests
of
right
and
justice
in
common
honesty
and
decency
you
ought
to
tell
what
you
know
maida
i
am
a
man
and
i
am
in
love
with
you
that
explains
much
i
will

and
then
maida

in
a
low
tone

it
to
you
then
do
you
see
what
i
mean
when
i
say

will
produce

the
consequences
of
your
own
rash

large
innocent
keefe

straight
into
maida
s
eyes
and
her
own
fell
in
confusion

do
it
she
asked
tremulously
when
i
say
i
will
do
a
thing
i
ve
already
proved
to
my
own
satisfaction
that
i
can
do
it
but
i
ll
do
it
only
at
my
own
price
the
price

consequences

maida
said
after
an
interval
of
silence
i
can
t
i
am
forced
to
accept
your
offer
you
may
not
accept
it
with
that
curtis
then

i
say
chapter
xvi
maida
s
decision

can
not

i
shall
never
let
you

keefe
when
i
know
how
you
love
sara
wheeler
spoke
quietly
but
her
agonized
face
and
eyes
told
of
her
deep
distress
though
not
demonstrative
she
loved
her
daughter
her
only
child
with
an
affection
that
was
almost
idolatry
and
she
had
been
glad
of
the
idea
of
maida
s
marriage
to
jeffrey
for
she
knew
of
his
sterling
worth
and
she
knew
the
depth
and
sincerity
of
their
attachment
don
t
say
you
won
t
let
me
mother
maida
spoke
in
a
dull
sad
tone
of
calm
despair
it
must
be
so
i
m
not
saying
i
love
m
not
saying
much
about
it
i
tell
you
must
be
and
you
must
not
raise
a
single
word
of
you
do
you
will
only
make
my
hard
lot
but
dear
you
must
explain
i
am
your
ve
always
had
your
confidence
and
i
ought
to
be
told
why
you
are
doing
this
that
s
just
the
trouble
mother
i
can
t
tell
you
and
because
of
the
confidence
that
has
always
been
between
us
you
must
trust
me
and
believe
that
i
am
doing
doing
the
only
possible
thing
oh
it
is
all
hard
enough
without
having
to
argue
about
it
why
my
will
power
may
give
out
my
soul
strength
may
break
down
mother
don
t
combat
me
don
t
tempt
me
aside
from
the
only
straight
line
of
duty
and
of
right
child
you
are
not
doing
right
you
can
not
have
a
duty
of
which
i
know
nothing
of
which
your
father
knows
nothing
maida
my
little
girl
what
is
this
thing
that
has
warped
your
sense
of
right
and
wrong
has
curtis
keefe
won
your
heart
away
from
no
never
that
but
it
would
be
a
wrong
to
jeffrey
for
me
to
marry
would
be
a
wrong
all
of
us
by
marrying
keefe
i
can
make
everything
she
suddenly
assumed
an
air
of
cold
stern
determination
mother
my
mind
is
made
up
you
can
not
change
it
nor
can
you
help
me
by
trying
you
only
make
it
harder
for
me
and
i
beg
of
you
to
stop
and
know
killed
hush
maida
you
never
did
i
know
you
didn
t
but
it
was
either
i
or
father
you
don
t
believe
he
did
do
you
god
help
me
i
don
t
know
what
to
believe
but
i
tried
to
say
i
did
i
couldn
t
carry
it
can
you
nor
can
father
then
oh
mother
i
did
do
that
shooting
i
did
i
did
every
assertion
like
that
makes
me
more
certain
you
didn
t
and
wheeler
fondly
caressed
the
head
that
lay
on
her
breast
maida
was
not
hysterical
but
so
deeply
troubled
that
she
was
nervously
unstrung
and
now
gave
way
to
torrents
of
tears
and
then
ceased
crying
and
bravely
announced
her
plans
please
mother
darling
don
t
talk
about
that
suppose
i
tell
you
that
even
that
matter
will
be
all
set
right
if
i
marry
curtis
by
no
other
means
even
stone
can
t
find
any
other
suspect
than
us
three
wheelers
he
doesn
t
at
all
believe
in
the
nobody
i
only
as
a
last
chance
to
free
father
and
me
mother
it
s
an
awful
situation
worse
far
worse
than
you
know
anything
about
won
t
you
trust
me
to
do
what
i
know
to
be
when
i
tell
you
i
must
marry
keefe
won
t
you
believe
me
and
not
only
believe
me
but
help
me
help
me
in
every
way
you
god
knows
i
need
what
can
i
do
darling
asked
sara
wheeler
awed
by
the
look
of
utter
hopelessness
on
maida
s
face
stand
by
me
mother
urge
father
not
to
oppose
this
marriage
help
me
to
tell
tell
him
can
t
you
mother
i
can
i
can
t
again
sara
wheeler
broke
out
into
protestations
against
this
sacrifice
of
her
loved
daughter
and
again
maida
had
to
reaffirm
her
decision
until
both
worn
out
they
separated
sara
promising
to
do
just
as
maida
wished
in
all
things
and
in
fulfillment
of
this
promise
sara
told
young
allen
as
she
expected
he
was
stunned
by
the
news
but
where
she
had
supposed
he
would
show
anger
or
rage
he
showed
only
a
deep
sympathy
for
maida
poor
little
girl
he
said
the
quick
tears
springing
to
his
eyes
what
dreadful
thing
can
that
man
have
held
over
her
to
force
her
to
this
and
what
is
the
best
way
for
me
to
go
about
remedying
the
situation
you
know
wheeler
maida
wouldn
t
talk
like
that
unless
she
had
arrived
at
a
very
desperate
if
she
killed
she
never
did
no
power
on
earth
can
make
me
believe
that
why
when
maida
s
own
confession
doesn
t
convince
me
what
else
could
no
there
s
some
deep
mystery
behind
that
murder
i
mean
something
far
deeper
and
more
mysterious
than
any
of
us
yet
realize
i
think
stone
is
on
track
of
the
solution
but
he
can
not
have
made
much
if
he
has
he
hasn
t
told
of
it
yet
but
i
m
not
a
is
any
needed
when
stone
is
on
the
case
but
i
am
out
to
protect
and
clear
my
darling
poor
child
how
she
is
suffering
where
is
she
don
t
go
to
her
jeff
at
least
not
just
now
she
begged
that
you
wouldn
but
i
ve
got
to
no
for
her
dear
for
our
maida
s
sake
leave
her
alone
for
the
present
she
is
so
worried
and
anxious
so
wrought
up
to
the
very
verge
of
collapse
that
if
you
try
to
talk
to
her
she
will
go
all
to
but
that
s
all
wrong
i
ought
to
soothe
her
to
comfort
make
her
more
troubled
you
ought
to
i
know
but
you
wouldn
t
oh
it
isn
t
your
isn
t
that
you
don
t
love
her
that
she
doesn
t
love
you
fact
that
s
just
the
trouble
try
to
see
it
jeff
maida
is
in
the
clutch
of
circumstances
i
don
t
know
the
facts
you
don
t
but
it
is
true
that
the
kindest
thing
we
can
do
for
her
just
now
is
to
leave
her
alone
she
will
do
as
she
sees
it
yes
but
she
sees
wrong
i
know
she
does
the
child
has
always
been
i
m
positive
that
whatever
she
is
up
to
it
s
something
to
save
her
father
oh
you
believe
he
why
wheeler
don
t
know
whether
your
husband
killed
appleby
or
not
i
don
t
know
heaven
help
can
i
know
the
two
of
them
shielding
each
wait
a
minute
if
they
are
shielding
each
re
both
innocent
but
it
isn
t
that
way
wheeler
said
to
me
at
first
of
course
either
maida
or
i
did
it
we
both
know
which
one
did
it
but
if
we
don
t
tell
no
one
else
can
i
see
that
point
but
i
should
think
knowing
both
so
closely
as
you
do
you
could
discern
the
gazed
at
her
you
have
of
course
as
you
say
in
such
intimacy
as
we
three
are
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
not
to
was
maida
yes
how
are
you
certain
her
father
saw
saw
her
shoot
then
i
m
glad
you
told
me
i
m
going
to
marry
her
at
once
and
have
all
rights
of
her
protection
through
the
it
comes
to
that
nothing
else
could
have
convinced
me
of
her
act
poor
dear
little
maida
i
ve
known
her
capability
for
sudden
impulsive
action
well
if
wheeler
saw
s
all
there
is
to
be
said
now
dear
wheeler
you
must
let
me
go
to
my
maida
but
jeffrey
i
only
told
you
that
to
persuade
you
to
let
her
alone
let
her
have
her
own
way
she
says
that
to
marry
curtis
keefe
will
save
her
from
from
suspicion
she
says
he
can
free
her
from
all
implication
in
the
by
a
fraud
i
don
t
i
won
t
have
it
if
maida
did
that
shooting
she
had
ample
rather
not
a
man
on
a
jury
would
convict
her
and
i
d
rather
she
d
stand
trial
oh
no
jeffrey
don
t
talk
like
that
i
d
consent
to
anything
to
save
that
girl
from
a
you
can
t
mean
you
want
her
tried
rather
than
to
see
her
married
to
any
man
but
me
i
wait
jeff
we
mustn
t
be
selfish
i
m
her
mother
and
much
as
i
d
hate
to
see
her
marry
keefe
i
d
far
prefer
her
sake
no
a
thousand
times
no
why
i
won
t
give
her
up
keefe
is
a
fine
ve
nothing
against
she
s
my
own
little
and
for
that
your
own
re
going
to
claim
her
it
isn
t
only
for
my
own
sake
spoke
more
humbly
but
i
know
how
she
loves
me
to
let
her
marry
another
would
be
to
do
her
a
grievous
not
if
she
wants
there
wheeler
pointed
from
the
window
and
they
saw
maida
walking
across
the
lawn
in
deep
and
earnest
conversation
with
curtis
keefe
he
was
tall
and
handsome
and
the
deferential
air
and
courteous
attitude
all
spoke
in
his
favor
maida
was
apparently
listening
with
interest
to
his
talk
and
they
went
on
slowly
toward
the
old
sycamore
and
sat
down
on
the
bench
beneath
it
our
jeffrey
murmured
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
pair
it
did
not
require
observation
to
see
that
maida
was
listening
willingly
to
keefe
nor
was
there
room
for
doubt
that
he
was
saying
something
that
pleased
her
she
was
brighter
and
more
cheerful
than
she
had
been
for
days
you
see
said
sara
wheeler
sadly
and
he
is
a
man
appleby
thought
very
highly
of
i
don
t
said
allen
briefly
and
unable
to
stand
any
more
he
left
the
room
he
went
straight
to
the
two
who
were
sitting
under
the
big
tree
and
spoke
directly
what
does
this
mean
maida
your
mother
tells
me
let
me
answer
spoke
up
keefe
gaily
it
means
that
miss
wheeler
has
promised
to
marry
me
and
we
ask
your
are
you
not
aware
jeff
s
face
was
white
but
his
voice
was
controlled
and
steady
that
miss
wheeler
is
my
fianc√©e
hardly
that
demurred
keefe
i
believe
there
was
what
is
called
an
understanding
but
i
m
assured
it
has
never
been
announced
however
the
lady
will
speak
for
go
away
jeff
maida
pleaded
please
go
not
until
you
tell
me
yourself
maida
what
you
are
doing
why
does
keefe
say
these
things
it
is
maida
s
face
was
as
white
as
allen
s
i
am
going
to
marry
keefe
if
you
considered
me
bound
to
you
break
it
off
please
go
away
the
last
words
were
wrung
from
her
in
a
choked
agonized
voice
as
if
she
were
at
the
end
of
her
composure
i
m
going
allen
said
and
went
off
in
a
daze
he
was
convinced
of
one
thing
only
that
maida
was
in
the
power
of
something
or
some
combination
of
circumstances
that
forced
her
to
this
he
had
no
doubt
she
meant
what
she
said
had
no
doubt
she
would
really
marry
he
couldn
t
think
she
had
ceased
to
love
own
jeffrey
if
he
thought
that
he
was
ready
to
die
he
walked
along
half
blindly
thinking
round
in
circles
always
coming
back
to
the
practically
a
maida
being
the
murderer
and
wondering
how
keefe
meant
to
save
her
from
the
clutches
of
the
law
he
was
dazed
and
as
he
went
along
unseeingly
genevieve
lane
met
him
turned
and
walked
by
his
side
what
s
curtie
keefe
doing
with
your
girl
she
asked
for
the
rolling
lawn
was
so
free
of
trees
the
pair
beneath
the
sycamore
could
be
plainly
seen
i
don
t
know
said
allen
honestly
enough
as
he
looked
in
the
face
of
the
stenographer
i
don
t
want
him
making
love
to
her
miss
lane
went
on
pouting
a
little
first
because
she
s
altogether
too
much
of
a
belle
anyway
and
she
paused
almost
scared
at
the
desperate
gaze
allen
gave
her
i
hope
you
mean
because
you
look
upon
him
as
your
property
he
said
but
without
smiling
now
just
why
do
you
hope
that
because
in
that
case
surely
you
can
get
him
oh
what
an
aspersion
on
miss
wheeler
s
fascinations
hush
i
m
in
no
mood
for
chaffing
are
you
and
keefe
special
friends
genevieve
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
then
said
very
frankly
if
we
re
not
it
isn
t
my
fault
tell
you
the
bald
truth
we
would
have
been
had
not
miss
wheeler
come
between
are
you
sure
of
that
how
rude
you
are
but
m
practically
sure
nobody
can
be
sure
till
they
re
certain
you
don
t
try
to
joke
with
me
look
here
miss
lane
suppose
you
and
i
try
to
work
together
for
our
respective
meaning
just
what
allen
meaning
that
we
try
to
separate
keefe
and
just
at
this
seriously
and
permanently
you
because
you
want
him
and
i
because
i
want
her
isn
t
it
logical
yes
but
if
i
could
get
him
back
don
t
you
suppose
i
would
you
don
t
get
the
idea
you
re
to
work
for
me
and
i
for
try
to
make
maida
give
him
yes
but
we
must
have
some
pretty
strong
arguments
now
have
you
any
idea
why
maida
has
picked
him
up
with
the
tongs
i
have
a
very
decided
idea
in
fact
i
you
do
is
it
a
secret
it
is
such
a
big
secret
that
if
it
leaked
out
the
whole
universe
so
far
as
it
affects
the
wheeler
family
would
be
turned
connected
with
death
of
appleby
not
with
the
that
s
what
you
mean
but
it
was
because
of
the
death
of
appleby
that
the
secret
came
to
can
you
tell
me
i
do
i
want
to
what
would
make
you
want
to
if
you
could
do
what
you
sort
of
keefe
resume
his
attentions
to
poor
little
genevieve
and
leave
the
lovely
maida
to
but
how
can
i
do
that
dunno
i
m
sure
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
secret
and
then
try
to
get
my
own
reward
by
my
own
efforts
oh
i
don
t
know
what
i
want
i
m
nearly
distracted
but
pulled
himself
i
m
on
the
job
and
i
m
going
to
accomplish
lot
now
i
m
not
going
to
dicker
with
you
size
it
up
for
yourself
don
t
you
believe
that
if
you
told
me
that
as
it
can
be
used
in
the
furtherance
of
right
and
happiness
for
all
t
you
believe
that
i
might
use
it
in
a
way
that
would
incidentally
result
in
a
better
adjustment
of
the
present
combination
he
nodded
toward
the
two
under
the
sycamore
maybe
genevieve
said
slowly
and
thoughtfully
i
thought
of
telling
tell
me
first
and
let
me
advise
i
will
i
have
confidence
in
you
allen
and
too
it
may
be
a
good
thing
to
keep
the
secret
in
the
family
the
truth
is
then
that
wheeler
is
not
legally
the
heir
to
this
she
is
if
she
lives
in
massachusetts
and
the
house
is
so
oh
fiddlesticks
i
don
t
mean
that
part
of
it
the
estate
is
left
with
the
proviso
that
the
inheritor
shall
live
in
what
i
mean
is
that
it
isn
t
left
to
wheeler
at
all
she
thought
it
was
of
there
is
another
is
there
i
ve
often
heard
them
speak
of
such
a
possibility
but
they
never
could
find
a
trace
of
i
know
it
and
they
re
so
honest
that
if
they
knew
of
one
they
d
put
up
no
fight
i
mean
if
they
knew
there
is
a
real
heir
and
that
sara
wheeler
is
not
the
right
who
is
curtis
keefe
oh
no
miss
lane
are
you
sure
i
am
i
discovered
it
from
appleby
s
private
papers
since
his
does
keefe
know
it
of
course
but
he
doesn
t
know
i
know
it
now
see
here
allen
get
this
appleby
knew
it
when
he
came
down
here
is
only
my
own
theory
but
i
ll
bet
it
s
the
right
had
discovered
it
lately
keefe
didn
t
know
it
my
theory
is
that
he
came
down
here
to
hold
that
knowledge
as
a
club
over
the
head
of
wheeler
to
force
him
to
do
his
appleby
s
bidding
in
the
campaign
matters
well
was
killed
to
prevent
the
information
going
any
killed
by
whom
genevieve
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
can
t
say
any
one
of
the
three
wheelers
might
have
done
it
for
that
no
you
re
wrong
neither
nor
wheeler
would
have
they
d
give
up
the
place
at
your
mental
reservation
speaks
for
itself
that
leaves
maida
suppose
she
knew
it
and
the
rest
didn
t
suppose
in
order
to
keep
the
knowledge
from
her
don
t
go
on
he
begged
i
see
it
was
so
next
curt
keefe
has
fallen
a
victim
to
maida
s
smiles
that
s
what
s
making
more
trouble
than
anything
else
i
m
positive
he
is
arguing
that
if
she
will
marry
him
he
will
keep
quiet
about
his
being
the
heir
then
her
parents
can
live
here
in
peace
for
the
rest
of
their
i
begin
to
i
knew
you
would
now
knowing
this
and
being
bound
to
secrecy
concerning
it
except
as
you
agreed
if
it
can
serve
our
ends
where
do
we
go
from
here
allen
looked
at
her
steadily
do
you
expect
miss
lane
that
i
will
consent
to
keep
this
secret
from
the
wheelers
you
ll
have
to
she
returned
simply
maida
knows
it
therefore
it
s
her
secret
now
if
she
doesn
t
want
her
parents
can
t
presume
to
tell
them
allen
looked
blank
and
you
mean
she
d
marry
keefe
to
keep
the
secret
from
her
parents
exactly
that
and
there
d
be
no
harm
in
keeping
the
secret
that
way
for
if
curt
keefe
were
her
husband
it
wouldn
t
matter
whether
he
was
the
rightful
heir
or
not
if
he
didn
t
choose
to
exercise
or
even
make
known
his
i
see
to
the
murder
genevieve
helped
him
well
i
don
t
know
if
maida
did
i
can
t
see
any
way
out
of
that
conclusion
curt
will
do
whatever
he
can
to
get
her
off
easily
perhaps
he
can
divert
suspicion
know
he
made
up
that
bugler
man
and
has
stuck
to
he
can
get
a
persons
unknown
maybe
with
money
and
influence
he
can
hush
the
whole
thing
would
never
be
convicted
why
possibly
the
threat
of
he
did
be
called
blackmail
anyhow
if
there
s
a
loophole
curtis
keefe
will
find
it
he
s
as
smart
as
they
make
em
now
you
know
the
the
inevitabilities
i
might
say
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
something
pretty
desperate
i
can
tell
you
fine
talk
but
what
s
the
first
step
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
i
sure
then
i
say
let
s
take
the
whole
story
to
fleming
at
chapter
xvii
maida
and
her
father
genevieve
hesitated
although
she
had
thought
of
doing
this
herself
yet
she
was
not
quite
sure
she
wanted
to
but
allen
insisted
come
with
me
or
not
as
you
choose
he
said
but
i
m
going
to
tell
stone
a
secret
like
that
must
be
the
interests
of
law
and
justice
justice
to
whom
asked
genevieve
why
to
all
allen
stopped
to
think
keefe
for
one
he
concluded
a
little
lamely
yes
and
to
yourself
for
two
genevieve
exclaimed
you
want
the
secret
to
come
out
so
maida
won
t
marry
curt
to
keep
it
quiet
own
up
allen
couldn
t
deny
this
but
back
of
it
was
his
instinctive
desire
for
justice
all
round
and
he
doggedly
stuck
to
his
determination
of
laying
the
matter
before
fleming
stone
genevieve
accompanied
him
and
together
they
sought
stone
in
his
fibsy
was
there
and
the
two
were
in
deep
consultation
come
in
stone
said
as
his
visitors
appeared
you
have
something
to
tell
me
i
gather
from
your
eager
we
have
allen
returned
and
he
began
to
tell
his
story
let
me
tell
it
miss
lane
interrupted
him
impatiently
you
see
stone
allen
is
in
love
with
miss
wheeler
and
he
can
t
help
coloring
things
in
her
and
you
re
in
love
with
keefe
stone
said
but
without
a
smile
and
you
can
t
help
coloring
things
in
his
the
girl
bridled
a
little
but
was
in
no
way
embarrassed
at
the
assertion
take
your
choice
then
she
said
flippantly
who
do
you
want
to
tell
you
the
secret
we
re
ready
to
give
away
both
fibsy
spoke
up
i
ll
bet
it
s
a
yarn
and
we
ll
hear
both
you
please
ladies
first
pipe
up
miss
the
actual
secret
can
be
quickly
told
the
girl
said
speaking
a
little
shortly
the
truth
is
that
wheeler
is
not
the
legal
heir
to
this
estate
of
sycamore
keefe
curtis
keefe
stone
exclaimed
and
fibsy
gave
a
sharp
explosive
whistle
yes
said
genevieve
well
pleased
at
the
sensation
her
words
had
produced
not
that
her
hearers
made
any
further
demonstration
of
surprise
stone
fell
into
a
brown
study
and
fibsy
got
up
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
whistling
softly
under
his
breath
well
the
boy
said
finally
returning
to
his
chair
well
stone
things
is
changed
since
gran
ma
died
hey
in
many
ways
stone
assented
you
re
sure
of
this
of
course
he
asked
genevieve
how
do
you
know
well
i
learned
it
from
appleby
s
private
papers
yes
of
course
he
didn
t
have
em
framed
and
hanging
on
his
wall
you
see
keefe
being
appleby
s
confidential
secretary
had
access
to
all
his
papers
after
the
old
gentleman
his
son
of
course
young
sam
is
the
heir
and
owns
everything
but
he
kept
curt
on
in
the
same
position
and
so
keefe
went
over
all
the
papers
as
stenographer
and
general
assistant
i
couldn
t
very
well
help
knowing
the
contents
of
the
papers
and
so
i
learned
the
truth
that
keefe
who
is
of
another
branch
of
the
family
is
really
the
principal
heir
to
the
estate
that
is
now
in
wheeler
s
possession
i
can
t
give
you
all
the
actual
details
but
you
can
of
course
verify
my
of
course
mused
stone
and
keefe
hasn
t
announced
this
that
s
it
genevieve
nodded
assent
to
his
meaning
glance
because
he
wants
to
marry
maida
and
if
she
ll
marry
him
he
ll
keep
quiet
about
the
heirship
or
rather
in
that
case
it
won
t
matter
as
the
elder
wheelers
can
live
here
if
it
s
the
property
of
their
but
if
not
then
when
keefe
walks
wheeler
family
must
walk
out
and
where
would
they
go
i
can
take
care
of
them
declared
allen
maida
is
my
promised
wife
if
she
consents
to
marry
keefe
it
will
be
under
compulsion
for
she
knew
this
secret
and
she
dared
not
tell
her
people
because
it
meant
poverty
and
homelessness
for
them
you
know
wheeler
is
incapable
of
lucrative
work
and
wheeler
brought
up
to
affluence
and
comfort
can
t
be
expected
to
live
in
want
but
i
can
take
care
of
is
i
they
could
only
live
in
boston
my
business
is
there
and
we
could
all
live
on
my
earnings
if
we
could
live
the
young
allen
seemed
scarcely
more
than
a
really
thinking
aloud
as
he
voiced
these
plans
and
suggestions
but
he
shook
his
head
sadly
as
he
realized
that
daniel
wheeler
couldn
t
go
to
boston
and
that
a
marriage
between
keefe
and
maida
was
the
only
way
to
preserve
to
them
their
present
home
some
situation
remarked
fibsy
and
the
secret
is
no
secret
really
for
if
miss
wheeler
doesn
t
marry
keefe
he
ll
tell
it
at
once
and
if
she
does
the
whole
matter
doesn
t
matter
at
all
but
i
think
she
will
for
what
else
can
she
do
jeffrey
allen
looked
angrily
at
the
boy
but
fibsy
s
funny
little
face
showed
such
a
serious
interest
that
it
was
impossible
to
chide
him
i
think
she
won
t
allen
said
but
i
m
not
sure
just
yet
how
i
m
going
to
prevent
you
won
t
have
to
said
stone
miss
wheeler
will
prevent
it
i
miss
my
guess
he
looked
kindly
at
the
young
man
but
received
only
a
half
smile
in
return
if
we
all
do
our
share
in
the
matter
perhaps
we
can
arrange
things
genevieve
said
speaking
very
seriously
i
ve
something
to
say
for
i
am
engaged
to
curtis
keefe
does
he
think
you
are
stone
said
rather
casually
miss
lane
had
the
grace
to
blush
through
her
rouge
but
she
declared
he
doesn
t
want
to
and
added
but
he
ought
to
he
has
made
love
to
me
and
he
once
asked
me
to
marry
him
but
since
then
he
has
said
he
didn
t
mean
it
i
don
t
suppose
i
ve
enough
evidence
for
a
breach
of
promise
suit
well
and
she
tossed
her
pretty
head
i
ve
not
the
least
doubt
that
if
miss
wheeler
were
out
of
the
safely
married
to
allen
i
d
have
no
trouble
in
whistling
my
curtie
i
ll
bet
you
wouldn
t
fibsy
looked
at
her
admiringly
if
i
were
only
a
few
years
hush
terence
said
fleming
stone
don
t
talk
immediately
fibsy
s
face
became
serious
and
he
turned
his
attention
away
from
the
fascinating
genevieve
but
all
this
is
aside
the
question
of
the
murderer
stone
said
allen
how
are
you
progressing
with
that
investigation
better
than
i
ve
disclosed
as
yet
stone
returned
speaking
slowly
recent
developments
have
been
helpful
and
i
hope
to
be
ready
soon
to
give
a
you
expect
appleby
down
yes
or
by
that
time
i
hope
to
be
ready
to
make
an
maida
cried
jeffrey
the
word
seeming
wrung
from
him
against
his
will
forgive
me
if
i
do
not
reply
said
stone
with
an
earnest
glance
at
the
questioner
but
i
d
like
to
talk
to
miss
wheeler
will
you
go
for
her
allen
i
d
rather
yes
i
see
said
stone
kindly
you
go
i
ll
go
offered
genevieve
with
the
result
that
she
and
mcguire
flew
out
of
the
room
at
the
same
time
all
right
beauteous
one
we
ll
both
go
fibsy
said
as
they
went
along
the
hall
side
by
side
where
is
the
lady
donno
but
we
ll
find
her
i
say
terence
come
down
on
the
veranda
just
a
minute
leading
him
to
a
far
corner
where
there
was
no
danger
of
eavesdroppers
genevieve
made
another
attempt
to
gain
an
ally
for
her
own
cause
i
say
she
began
you
have
a
lot
of
influence
with
your
stone
don
t
you
oh
heaps
and
fibsy
s
sweeping
gesture
indicated
a
wide
expanse
of
imagination
at
least
no
fooling
i
know
you
have
now
you
use
that
influence
for
me
and
i
ll
do
something
for
what
ll
you
do
i
don
t
know
nothing
particular
but
i
mean
if
at
any
time
i
can
help
you
in
any
ve
influence
too
with
big
men
in
the
financial
and
business
world
i
haven
t
always
worked
for
the
applebys
and
wherever
i
ve
been
i
ve
made
friends
that
i
can
count
oh
you
mean
a
tip
on
the
stock
market
or
something
of
that
sort
yes
or
a
position
in
a
big
office
you
re
not
always
going
to
be
a
detective
s
apprentice
are
you
you
bet
i
am
watcha
talking
about
me
leave
stone
not
on
your
fleeting
existence
but
never
mind
that
part
of
the
argument
i
ll
remember
your
offer
and
some
day
when
i
have
a
million
dollars
to
invest
i
ll
ask
your
advice
where
to
lose
it
but
now
you
tell
me
what
you
only
for
you
to
hint
to
stone
that
he
d
better
advise
miss
wheeler
not
to
marry
so
s
you
can
have
never
mind
that
there
are
other
there
well
then
my
orders
are
to
advise
stone
to
advise
wheeler
not
to
wed
one
that
s
just
it
but
don
t
say
it
right
out
to
him
use
tact
which
i
know
you
nobody
d
guess
it
to
look
at
sort
of
argue
around
so
he
ll
see
it
s
wiser
for
her
not
to
marry
why
miss
lane
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
i
m
not
saying
why
that
s
enough
for
me
to
know
you
ll
get
along
better
not
does
he
know
she
s
i
don
t
wonder
you
can
t
say
it
i
can
t
either
yes
he
knows
she
he
s
so
crazy
about
her
he
doesn
t
care
what
is
there
in
that
girl
that
gets
all
the
men
it
s
her
sweetness
said
fibsy
with
a
positive
nod
of
his
head
as
if
he
were
simply
stating
an
axiom
yep
keefe
is
clean
gone
daffy
over
her
i
don
t
blame
of
course
my
taste
runs
more
don
t
you
dare
cried
genevieve
coquettishly
to
the
rouged
type
fibsy
went
on
placidly
to
my
mind
a
complexion
dabbed
on
is
far
more
attractive
than
nature
s
miss
lane
burst
into
laughter
and
far
from
offended
she
said
you
re
a
darling
boy
and
i
ll
never
forget
in
my
will
now
to
come
back
to
our
dear
old
brass
tacks
will
you
tip
a
gentle
hint
to
the
great
stone
oh
lord
ll
tip
him
a
too
don
t
worry
as
to
my
discretion
but
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
i
might
as
well
tip
the
washington
monument
you
see
has
made
up
his
as
to
the
murderer
who
is
it
haven
t
an
if
i
had
i
d
say
i
hadn
t
you
see
i
m
his
oh
well
in
any
case
you
can
put
in
a
word
against
keefe
can
t
you
but
genevieve
had
lost
interest
in
her
project
she
realized
if
stone
had
accomplished
his
purpose
and
had
solved
the
murder
mystery
he
would
be
apt
to
take
small
interest
in
the
love
affairs
of
herself
or
maida
wheeler
either
he
won
t
think
much
of
his
cherished
trusty
if
you
don
t
do
the
errand
he
sent
you
on
she
said
rather
crossly
fibsy
gave
her
a
reproachful
glance
this
from
you
he
said
dramatically
farewell
fair
but
false
i
go
to
seek
a
fairer
maiden
and
i
know
where
to
find
her
he
went
flying
across
the
lawn
for
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
maida
in
the
garden
miss
wheeler
he
said
as
he
reached
her
will
you
please
come
now
to
see
stone
he
wants
certainly
she
replied
and
turning
followed
him
genevieve
joined
them
and
the
three
went
to
stone
s
rooms
miss
wheeler
the
detective
said
without
preamble
i
want
you
to
tell
me
a
few
things
please
you
ll
excuse
me
if
my
questions
seem
rather
pointed
also
if
they
seem
to
be
queries
already
answered
did
you
kill
appleby
yes
said
maida
speaking
wearily
as
if
tired
of
making
the
assertion
you
know
no
one
believes
that
statement
i
can
t
help
that
stone
she
said
with
a
listless
manner
that
is
no
one
but
one
father
he
believes
father
exclaimed
the
girl
in
evident
amazement
yes
he
believes
you
for
the
best
of
all
possible
reasons
he
saw
you
what
stone
my
father
saw
me
shoot
appleby
yes
he
says
so
that
is
not
strange
when
as
you
say
you
fired
the
pistol
from
where
you
stood
in
the
bay
window
and
wheeler
stood
by
or
near
the
don
t
understand
you
say
father
says
he
me
yes
he
told
me
maida
was
silent
but
she
was
evidently
thinking
deeply
and
rapidly
this
is
a
trap
of
some
sort
stone
she
said
at
last
my
father
didn
t
see
me
couldn
t
have
seen
me
and
consequently
he
couldn
t
say
he
did
he
wouldn
t
lie
about
it
but
he
said
at
one
time
that
he
did
the
shooting
himself
was
not
that
an
untruth
of
a
quite
different
sort
he
said
that
in
a
justifiable
effort
to
save
me
but
this
other
him
to
say
he
saw
me
he
didn
couldn
why
couldn
t
he
miss
wheeler
why
was
it
so
impossible
for
your
father
to
see
you
commit
that
crime
when
he
was
right
there
stone
i
don
t
know
what
to
say
i
feel
sure
i
mustn
t
say
anything
or
i
shall
regret
would
you
like
your
father
to
come
here
and
tell
us
about
it
no
yes
oh
i
don
t
know
jeffrey
help
me
allen
had
sat
silently
brooding
all
through
this
conversation
he
had
not
looked
at
maida
keeping
his
gaze
turned
out
of
the
window
he
was
sorely
hurt
at
her
attitude
in
the
keefe
matter
he
was
puzzled
at
her
speech
regarding
her
father
and
he
was
utterly
uncertain
as
to
his
own
duty
or
privilege
in
the
whole
affair
but
at
her
appeal
he
turned
joyfully
toward
her
oh
maida
he
cried
let
me
help
you
do
get
your
father
here
now
and
settle
this
question
then
we
ll
see
what
call
him
then
said
maida
but
she
turned
very
white
and
paid
no
further
attention
to
allen
she
was
still
lost
in
thought
when
her
father
arrived
and
joined
the
group
you
said
wheeler
stone
began
at
once
that
you
saw
your
daughter
fire
the
shot
that
killed
appleby
i
did
say
that
daniel
wheeler
replied
because
it
is
true
and
because
i
am
convinced
that
the
truth
will
help
us
all
better
than
any
further
endeavor
to
prove
a
falsehood
i
did
see
you
maida
darling
and
i
tried
very
hard
to
take
the
blame
myself
but
it
has
been
proved
to
me
by
stone
that
my
pretence
is
useless
and
so
i
ve
concluded
that
the
fact
must
come
out
in
hope
of
a
better
result
than
from
concealment
do
not
fear
my
darling
no
harm
shall
come
to
and
you
said
you
did
it
father
and
mother
said
she
did
yes
of
course
i
told
your
mother
the
truth
and
we
plotted
for
each
of
us
to
confess
to
the
deed
in
a
wild
hope
of
somehow
saving
our
little
and
you
saw
me
shoot
father
why
yes
is
i
heard
the
shot
and
looked
up
to
see
you
standing
there
with
consternation
and
guilt
on
your
dear
face
your
arm
had
then
dropped
to
your
side
but
your
whole
attitude
was
unmistakable
i
couldn
t
shut
my
eyes
to
the
evident
fact
that
there
was
no
one
else
who
could
have
done
the
there
must
have
been
didn
t
do
i
knew
you
didn
t
oh
maida
with
a
bound
allen
was
at
her
side
and
his
arm
went
round
her
but
she
moved
away
from
him
and
went
on
in
a
strained
unnatural
voice
but
steadily
and
straightforwardly
no
i
didn
t
shoot
appleby
i
ve
been
saying
so
to
shield
my
father
i
thought
he
did
maida
is
it
possible
and
daniel
wheeler
looked
perplexed
but
oh
i
m
so
glad
to
hear
your
but
who
did
do
it
then
miss
lane
asked
bluntly
who
cares
so
long
as
it
wasn
t
any
of
the
wheelers
exclaimed
jeffrey
allen
unable
to
contain
his
gladness
oh
but
again
she
waved
him
away
from
her
i
don
t
understand
stone
she
began
i
don
t
know
where
these
disclosures
will
lead
i
hope
not
back
to
my
no
maida
said
her
father
there
s
no
fear
of
reassured
maida
went
on
perhaps
i
can
t
be
believed
now
after
my
previous
insistence
on
my
guilt
but
god
knows
it
is
the
truth
i
am
utterly
innocent
of
the
i
believe
it
said
fleming
stone
there
was
little
evidence
against
you
except
your
own
confession
now
you
ve
retracted
that
it
only
remains
for
me
to
find
the
real
can
you
cried
fibsy
excitedly
can
you
stone
don
t
you
know
which
way
to
look
terence
i
i
don
the
boy
murmured
oh
lordy
i
don
t
but
there
s
another
matter
to
be
agreed
upon
said
maida
who
had
not
at
all
regained
her
normal
poise
or
appearance
her
face
was
white
and
her
eyes
blurred
with
tears
but
she
persisted
in
speech
i
want
it
understood
that
i
am
engaged
to
marry
keefe
she
said
not
looking
at
jeffrey
at
all
i
announce
my
engagement
and
i
desire
him
to
be
looked
upon
and
considered
as
my
future
maida
came
simultaneously
from
the
lips
of
her
father
and
allen
yes
that
is
positive
and
irrevocable
i
have
my
own
reasons
for
this
and
one
of
them
is
one
very
important
one
is
that
keefe
knows
who
shot
appleby
and
can
produce
the
criminal
and
guarantee
his
confession
to
the
wow
fibsy
remarked
explosively
and
fleming
stone
stared
at
the
girl
he
used
this
as
an
argument
to
persuade
you
to
marry
him
miss
wheeler
i
don
t
put
it
that
way
stone
but
i
have
keefe
s
assurance
that
he
will
do
as
i
told
you
and
also
that
he
will
arrange
to
have
a
full
and
free
pardon
granted
to
my
father
for
the
old
sentence
he
is
still
suffering
well
maida
i
don
t
wonder
you
consented
said
miss
lane
her
round
eyes
wide
with
surprise
and
i
suppose
he
s
going
to
renounce
all
claim
to
this
estate
yes
said
maida
calmly
anything
else
said
allen
unable
to
keep
an
ironic
note
out
of
his
voice
yes
put
in
fibsy
he
s
going
to
be
governor
of
oh
my
heavens
and
earth
gasped
genevieve
what
rubbish
rubbish
nothing
fibsy
defended
his
statement
you
know
he
s
after
i
felt
sure
he
would
when
sam
appleby
gave
up
the
didn
t
know
he
had
taken
any
public
never
mind
what
keefe
is
going
to
do
or
not
going
to
do
said
maida
in
a
tone
of
finality
i
expect
to
marry
well
said
stone
in
a
way
i
think
our
next
one
to
confer
with
must
be
chapter
xviii
a
final
confession
inquiry
for
keefe
brought
the
information
that
he
had
gone
to
a
nearby
town
but
would
be
back
at
appleby
was
also
expected
to
arrive
for
dinner
coming
from
home
in
his
motor
car
but
in
the
late
afternoon
a
severe
storm
set
in
the
wind
rose
rapidly
and
gained
great
velocity
while
the
rain
fell
steadily
and
hard
curtis
keefe
arrived
very
wet
indeed
though
he
had
protecting
clothing
but
a
telephone
message
from
sam
appleby
said
that
he
was
obliged
to
give
up
all
idea
of
reaching
sycamore
ridge
that
night
he
had
stopped
at
a
roadhouse
and
owing
to
the
gale
he
dared
not
venture
forth
again
until
the
storm
was
over
he
would
therefore
not
arrive
until
next
day
lucky
we
got
his
word
said
wheeler
this
storm
will
soon
put
many
telephone
wires
out
of
when
keefe
came
down
at
the
dinner
hour
he
found
maida
alone
in
the
evidently
awaiting
him
my
darling
he
exclaimed
going
quickly
to
her
side
my
own
little
girl
are
you
here
to
greet
me
yes
she
said
and
suffered
rather
than
welcomed
his
caressing
hand
on
her
shoulder
curtis
i
told
them
you
would
tell
them
who
killed
so
i
will
dearest
after
dinner
let
s
not
have
unpleasant
subjects
discussed
at
table
i
ve
been
to
rushfield
and
i
ve
found
out
all
the
particulars
that
i
hadn
t
already
learned
ve
got
actual
proofs
now
who
s
a
cleverer
detective
than
the
professionals
then
that
s
all
right
now
are
you
sure
you
can
also
get
father
freed
i
hope
to
dear
that
s
all
i
can
say
at
present
do
you
take
me
for
a
magician
i
assure
you
i
m
only
an
ordinary
citizen
but
but
you
yes
my
little
love
i
did
and
i
well
know
that
you
promised
because
i
did
well
i
fancy
i
shall
keep
every
promise
i
made
you
but
not
every
one
as
promptly
as
this
exposure
of
the
but
you
ll
surely
fix
it
so
father
can
go
into
go
to
boston
well
rather
i
you
mustn
t
say
anything
about
i
ve
an
idea
that
you
may
yet
be
a
governor
s
wife
and
it
wouldn
t
do
then
to
have
your
father
barred
from
the
state
maida
sighed
the
hopes
keefe
held
out
were
the
realization
of
her
dearest
oh
the
price
she
must
pay
yet
she
was
she
determined
to
give
no
thought
whatever
to
jeffrey
for
if
she
did
she
knew
her
purpose
would
falter
nor
did
she
even
allow
herself
the
doubtful
privilege
of
feeling
sorry
for
him
well
she
knew
that
that
way
madness
lay
and
thought
the
poor
child
sad
and
though
jeff
may
be
his
sadness
and
heartbreak
are
no
worse
than
mine
not
so
bad
for
i
have
to
take
the
initiative
i
have
to
take
the
brunt
of
the
whole
situation
the
others
assembled
and
at
dinner
no
word
was
said
of
the
tragedy
save
for
maida
and
jeffrey
allen
the
party
was
almost
a
merry
one
daniel
wheeler
and
his
wife
were
so
relieved
at
the
disclosure
of
maida
s
innocence
that
they
felt
they
didn
t
care
much
what
happened
next
fibsy
flirted
openly
with
genevieve
and
fleming
stone
himself
was
quietly
entertaining
later
in
the
evening
they
gathered
in
the
den
and
keefe
revealed
his
discoveries
i
felt
all
along
he
said
that
there
must
have
been
a
man
on
the
south
veranda
who
did
the
shooting
didn
t
you
think
that
stone
i
did
at
times
stone
replied
truthfully
i
confess
though
my
opinion
changed
once
or
and
at
the
present
moment
insisted
keefe
at
the
present
moment
keefe
your
attitude
tells
me
that
you
expect
to
prove
that
there
was
such
a
factor
in
the
case
so
i
would
be
foolish
indeed
to
say
i
doubted
it
but
to
speak
i
do
think
there
was
a
man
there
and
he
was
the
murderer
he
shot
through
the
window
past
miss
wheeler
and
most
naturally
her
father
thought
she
fired
the
shot
herself
you
see
it
came
from
exactly
her
yes
agreed
keefe
and
moreover
you
remember
rachel
saw
the
man
on
the
the
cook
also
saw
cook
saw
him
fibsy
put
in
and
though
the
words
were
innocent
enough
his
tone
indicated
a
hidden
meaning
but
beyond
a
careless
glance
keefe
didn
t
notice
the
interruption
and
went
on
earnestly
now
the
man
the
servants
saw
was
the
murderer
and
i
have
traced
him
found
him
his
signed
with
unconcealed
pride
in
his
achievement
keefe
took
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
daniel
wheeler
why
the
written
confession
where
is
the
man
asked
stone
his
dark
eyes
alight
with
interest
gee
muttered
fibsy
under
his
breath
going
some
genevieve
lane
stared
and
excited
while
allen
and
the
wheelers
breathlessly
awaited
developments
john
mills
exclaimed
wheeler
looking
at
the
paper
oh
the
faithful
old
man
listen
stone
this
is
a
signed
confession
of
a
man
on
his
no
longer
that
said
keefe
solemnly
he
died
this
and
signed
this
just
before
he
died
yes
wheeler
in
the
hospital
the
witnesses
as
you
see
are
the
nurses
the
paper
merely
stated
that
the
undersigned
was
the
slayer
of
samuel
appleby
that
the
deed
was
committed
in
order
to
free
daniel
wheeler
from
wicked
and
unjust
molestation
and
tyranny
the
signature
though
faintly
scrawled
was
perfectly
legible
and
duly
witnessed
he
was
an
old
servant
of
mine
wheeler
said
thoughtfully
and
very
devoted
to
us
all
he
always
resented
appleby
s
attitude
toward
mills
was
my
butler
when
the
trouble
occurred
and
knew
all
about
it
he
has
been
an
invalid
for
a
year
but
has
been
very
ill
only
since
the
shooting
in
fact
said
keefe
significantly
it
must
have
been
a
hard
task
for
one
so
weak
wheeler
said
but
the
old
fellow
was
a
true
friend
to
me
all
his
life
tell
us
more
of
the
circumstances
i
did
it
all
by
thinking
said
keefe
his
manner
not
at
all
superior
nor
did
he
look
toward
fleming
stone
who
was
listening
attentively
i
felt
sure
there
was
some
man
from
outside
and
i
thought
first
of
some
enemy
of
appleby
s
but
later
i
thought
it
might
have
been
some
enemy
of
wheeler
s
and
the
shot
was
possibly
meant
for
wheeler
nodded
at
this
i
thought
that
too
he
observed
well
then
later
i
began
to
think
maybe
it
was
some
an
enemy
a
friend
of
course
of
wheeler
s
on
this
principle
i
searched
for
a
suspect
i
inquired
among
the
servants
being
careful
to
arouse
no
suspicion
of
my
real
intent
at
last
i
found
this
old
mills
had
always
been
devoted
to
the
whole
family
here
more
than
devoted
indeed
he
revered
wheeler
and
he
fairly
worshipped
the
ladies
he
has
been
ill
a
long
time
of
a
slow
and
incurable
malady
and
quite
lately
was
taken
to
the
hospital
when
i
reached
him
i
saw
the
poor
chap
had
but
a
very
short
time
to
and
you
suspected
him
of
crime
with
no
more
evidence
than
that
fleming
stone
asked
i
daresay
it
was
a
sort
of
intuition
stone
keefe
returned
smiling
a
little
at
the
detective
oh
i
don
t
wonder
you
feel
rather
miffed
to
have
your
thunder
stolen
by
a
mere
business
i
fear
it
s
unprofessional
for
me
to
put
the
thing
through
without
consulting
you
but
i
felt
the
case
required
careful
psychological
handling
very
much
so
stone
nodded
and
so
keefe
was
a
little
disconcerted
by
the
detective
s
demeanor
but
others
set
it
down
to
a
very
natural
chagrin
on
stone
s
part
fibsy
sat
back
in
his
chair
his
bright
eyes
narrowed
to
mere
slits
and
darting
from
the
face
of
keefe
to
that
of
stone
continually
and
so
keefe
went
on
i
inquired
from
the
servants
and
also
cautiously
from
the
members
of
the
family
and
i
learned
that
this
mills
was
of
a
fiery
even
revengeful
he
was
wheeler
nodded
emphatically
yes
sir
and
i
found
out
from
rachel
rachel
fibsy
fairly
shot
out
the
word
but
a
look
from
stone
made
him
say
no
more
yes
rachel
the
maid
went
on
keefe
and
i
found
that
the
man
she
saw
on
the
veranda
was
of
the
same
general
size
and
appearance
as
mills
well
i
somehow
felt
that
it
was
so
i
went
to
see
at
the
hospital
asked
wheeler
yes
some
days
ago
he
was
then
very
weak
and
the
nurses
didn
t
want
me
to
arouse
him
to
any
excitement
but
i
knew
it
was
my
of
course
put
in
stone
and
keefe
gave
him
a
patronizing
look
so
against
the
wishes
of
the
nurses
and
doctors
i
had
an
interview
alone
with
mills
and
i
found
he
was
the
he
confessed
asked
stone
yes
and
though
he
refused
to
sign
a
written
confession
he
agreed
he
would
confess
in
the
presence
of
wheeler
and
stone
was
only
this
the
doctor
assured
me
the
man
couldn
t
live
the
day
out
so
i
persuaded
the
dying
man
to
sign
this
confession
which
i
drew
up
and
read
to
him
in
the
presence
of
the
nurses
he
there
it
with
evident
modesty
keefe
pointed
to
the
paper
still
in
wheeler
s
hands
and
said
no
more
for
a
moment
nobody
spoke
the
storm
was
at
its
height
the
wind
whistled
and
roared
the
rain
fell
noisily
and
the
elements
seemed
to
be
doing
their
very
worst
genevieve
always
was
sensitive
to
weather
conditions
and
that
wind
was
enough
to
disturb
even
equable
nerves
and
this
same
mills
was
the
phantom
bugler
asked
stone
told
me
so
returned
keefe
he
knew
about
the
legend
you
see
and
he
thought
he
d
work
on
the
superstition
of
the
family
to
divert
attention
from
genevieve
gasped
but
quickly
suppressed
all
show
of
agitation
fibsy
a
few
notes
of
the
bugle
call
that
the
phantom
had
played
at
the
sound
keefe
turned
quickly
a
strange
look
on
his
face
and
the
wheelers
too
looked
startled
at
the
familiar
strain
be
quiet
terence
stone
said
rather
severely
and
the
boy
subsided
now
keefe
fleming
stone
said
you
must
not
i
fear
you
i
grudge
admiration
for
your
success
or
appreciation
of
your
cleverness
i
do
not
i
tell
you
very
sincerely
that
what
you
have
accomplished
is
as
fine
a
piece
of
work
as
i
have
ever
run
across
in
my
whole
career
as
detective
your
intuition
was
remarkable
and
your
following
it
up
a
masterpiece
by
the
way
i
suppose
that
it
was
mills
then
who
started
the
fire
in
the
garage
yes
it
was
said
keefe
you
see
he
is
a
clever
genius
in
a
sly
way
he
reasoned
that
if
a
fire
occurred
everybody
would
run
to
it
except
wheeler
who
can
not
go
over
the
line
he
hoped
that
therefore
appleby
would
not
go
appleby
suffered
from
any
rate
he
took
a
chance
that
the
fire
would
give
him
opportunity
to
shoot
unnoticed
which
it
it
certainly
did
now
keefe
did
he
tell
you
how
he
set
that
fire
no
he
did
not
was
the
short
reply
moreover
stone
i
resent
your
mode
of
questioning
i
m
not
on
the
witness
stand
i
ve
solved
a
mystery
that
baffled
you
and
though
i
understand
your
embarrassment
at
the
situation
yet
it
does
not
give
you
free
rein
to
make
what
seem
to
me
like
endeavors
to
trip
me
up
trip
you
up
stone
lifted
his
eyebrows
what
a
strange
expression
to
use
as
if
i
suspected
you
of
faking
his
it
speaks
for
itself
and
keefe
glanced
nonchalantly
at
the
paper
he
had
brought
there
s
the
signed
you
can
prove
that
signature
a
no
said
daniel
wheeler
decidedly
that
s
john
mills
autograph
i
know
it
perfectly
he
wrote
that
himself
and
a
dying
man
is
not
going
to
sign
a
lie
there
s
no
loophole
of
doubt
stone
i
think
you
must
admit
keefe
s
entire
i
do
admit
keefe
s
entire
success
stone
s
dark
eyes
flashed
up
to
this
point
from
here
on
i
shall
undertake
to
prove
my
own
entire
success
since
that
is
the
phrase
we
are
using
wheeler
your
present
cook
was
here
when
john
mills
worked
for
you
she
was
stone
but
you
don
t
need
her
corroboration
of
this
signature
i
tell
you
i
know
it
to
be
mills
will
you
send
for
the
cook
please
half
unwillingly
wheeler
agreed
and
maida
stepped
out
of
the
room
and
summoned
the
cook
the
woman
came
in
and
stone
spoke
to
her
at
once
is
that
john
mills
signature
he
asked
showing
her
the
paper
it
is
sir
she
replied
looking
at
him
in
wonder
a
satisfied
smile
played
on
keefe
s
face
only
to
be
effaced
at
stone
s
next
question
and
was
john
mills
the
person
you
the
south
veranda
that
night
of
appleby
s
murder
that
he
was
not
she
cried
emphatically
it
was
a
man
not
a
bit
like
mills
and
be
the
same
token
john
mills
was
in
his
bed
onable
to
walk
at
all
at
that
will
do
wheeler
and
stone
dismissed
the
cook
with
a
glance
now
keefe
as
if
that
woman
s
story
mattered
keefe
sneered
contemptuously
she
is
merely
mistaken
that
s
all
the
word
of
the
maid
rachel
is
as
good
as
that
of
the
oh
no
it
isn
t
stone
interrupted
but
paying
no
heed
to
him
keefe
went
on
and
you
can
scarcely
doubt
the
signature
after
wheeler
and
your
friend
the
cook
have
both
verified
though
his
demeanor
was
quiet
keefe
s
face
wore
a
defiant
expression
and
his
voice
was
a
trifle
blustering
i
do
not
doubt
the
signature
stone
declared
nor
do
i
doubt
that
you
obtained
it
at
the
hospital
exactly
as
you
have
described
that
keefe
s
face
relaxed
at
that
and
he
recovered
his
jaunty
manner
as
he
said
then
you
admit
i
have
beaten
you
at
your
own
game
stone
no
keefe
but
i
have
beaten
you
at
a
silence
fell
for
a
moment
there
was
something
about
stone
s
manner
of
speaking
that
made
for
conviction
in
the
minds
of
his
hearers
that
he
said
truth
wait
a
minute
oh
wait
a
minute
it
was
genevieve
lane
who
cried
out
the
words
and
then
she
sprang
from
her
chair
and
ran
to
keefe
s
side
flinging
her
arms
about
him
she
whispered
close
to
his
ear
he
listened
and
then
with
a
scornful
gesture
he
flung
her
off
no
he
said
to
her
no
a
thousand
times
no
do
your
i
shall
replied
genevieve
and
without
another
word
she
resumed
her
seat
yes
went
on
stone
this
interruption
being
over
your
ingenious
success
in
the
way
of
detecting
is
doomed
to
an
ignominious
end
you
see
sir
he
turned
to
daniel
wheeler
the
clever
ruse
keefe
has
worked
is
but
a
stratagem
to
deceive
us
all
and
to
turn
the
just
suspicion
of
the
criminal
in
an
unjust
explain
stone
said
wheeler
apparently
not
much
impressed
with
what
he
deemed
a
last
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
detective
to
redeem
his
reputation
yes
stone
said
keefe
if
my
solution
of
this
mystery
is
a
have
you
to
offer
in
its
place
you
admit
the
signed
confession
i
admit
the
signature
but
not
the
confession
john
mills
signed
that
paper
keefe
but
he
is
not
the
who
is
then
you
are
keefe
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
at
that
moment
there
was
such
a
blast
of
wind
and
storm
accompanied
by
a
fearful
crash
that
what
he
said
could
not
be
heard
explain
please
stone
wheeler
said
again
after
a
pause
but
his
voice
now
showed
more
interest
i
will
the
time
has
come
for
it
wheeler
do
you
and
allen
see
to
it
that
keefe
does
not
leave
the
room
your
eyes
keefe
still
smiled
but
his
smile
was
a
frozen
one
his
eyes
began
to
widen
and
his
hands
clenched
themselves
upon
his
knees
curtis
keefe
killed
samuel
appleby
stone
went
on
speaking
clearly
but
rapidly
his
motive
was
an
ambition
to
be
governor
of
massachusetts
he
thought
that
with
the
elder
appleby
out
of
the
way
his
son
would
have
neither
power
nor
inclination
to
make
a
campaign
there
were
other
minor
motives
but
that
was
his
primary
one
that
and
the
fact
that
the
elder
appleby
had
a
hold
on
keefe
and
of
late
had
pressed
it
home
uncomfortably
hard
the
murder
was
long
premeditated
the
trip
here
brought
it
about
because
it
offered
a
chance
where
others
might
reasonably
be
suspected
keefe
was
the
man
on
the
veranda
whom
the
cook
not
clearly
enough
to
distinguish
his
identity
though
she
did
know
it
was
not
john
interrupted
wheeler
greatly
perturbed
think
what
you
re
saying
have
you
evidence
to
prove
your
statements
i
have
wheeler
as
you
shall
see
let
me
tell
my
story
and
judge
me
then
a
first
proof
you
may
tell
of
the
i
went
at
stone
s
orders
the
boy
stated
simply
to
all
the
shops
or
little
stores
in
this
vicinity
where
a
bugle
might
have
been
bought
i
found
one
was
bought
in
a
very
small
shop
in
rushfield
and
bought
by
a
man
who
corresponded
to
keefe
s
description
and
who
when
he
stopped
at
the
shop
was
in
a
motor
car
whose
description
and
occupants
were
the
appleby
bunch
well
lane
here
knows
that
keefe
bought
that
t
you
he
turned
to
genevieve
who
after
a
glance
at
keefe
nodded
affirmation
and
so
stone
went
on
mr
keefe
used
that
how
did
he
get
opportunity
asked
wheeler
i
ll
tell
you
offered
genevieve
we
all
staid
over
night
in
rushfield
and
i
heard
keefe
go
out
of
doors
in
the
night
i
watched
him
from
my
window
he
returned
about
three
hours
it
was
clear
to
all
listening
that
when
genevieve
had
whispered
to
keefe
and
he
had
told
her
to
do
her
worst
they
were
now
hearing
the
so
stone
narrated
mr
keefe
came
over
here
and
did
the
bugling
as
a
preliminary
to
his
further
schemes
you
admit
that
keefe
i
admit
nothing
tell
your
silly
story
as
you
i
will
then
the
day
of
the
murder
keefe
arranged
for
the
fire
in
the
garage
he
used
the
acids
as
the
man
fulton
described
and
as
keefe
s
own
coat
was
burned
and
his
employer
s
car
he
felt
sure
suspicion
would
not
turn
toward
him
when
the
fire
broke
as
it
depended
on
the
action
of
those
acids
he
was
waiting
for
keefe
ran
with
allen
to
the
garage
this
i
have
verified
from
allen
keefe
disappeared
for
a
moment
and
later
was
again
at
allen
s
side
in
that
wheeler
that
psychological
moment
curtis
keefe
shot
and
killed
samuel
and
mills
is
part
of
the
diabolically
clever
scheme
mills
was
dying
he
was
leaving
a
large
family
without
means
of
support
he
depended
and
with
reason
on
hope
of
your
generosity
wheeler
to
his
wife
and
children
but
curtis
keefe
went
to
him
and
told
him
that
you
were
about
to
be
dispossessed
of
your
home
and
fortune
and
that
if
he
would
sign
the
what
it
he
keefe
would
settle
a
large
sum
of
money
on
mills
and
the
children
at
once
and
he
you
fiend
you
devil
incarnate
cried
keefe
losing
all
control
how
do
you
know
that
i
found
it
all
out
from
mills
stone
replied
your
accomplices
all
betrayed
you
keefe
a
criminal
should
beware
of
accomplices
rachel
turned
state
s
evidence
and
told
how
you
bribed
her
to
make
up
that
story
of
the
rather
to
relate
story
you
taught
to
it
s
all
up
said
keefe
flinging
out
his
hands
in
despair
you
ve
outwitted
me
at
every
point
stone
i
confess
myself
and
you
confess
yourself
the
murderer
said
stone
quickly
i
do
but
i
ask
one
favor
may
i
take
that
paper
a
moment
certainly
said
stone
glancing
at
the
worthless
confession
keefe
stepped
to
the
table
desk
where
the
paper
lay
but
as
he
laid
his
left
hand
upon
it
with
his
right
he
quickly
pulled
open
a
drawer
grasped
the
pistol
that
was
in
it
and
saying
with
a
slight
smile
a
life
for
a
life
drew
the
trigger
and
fell
to
the
floor
from
the
gruesome
situation
its
silence
made
worse
by
the
noise
of
the
storm
outside
daniel
wheeler
led
his
wife
and
daughter
jeffrey
allen
followed
quickly
and
sought
his
loved
maida
reaction
from
the
strain
made
her
break
down
and
sobbing
in
his
arms
she
asked
and
received
full
forgiveness
for
her
enforced
desertion
of
him
i
couldn
t
do
anything
else
jeff
she
sobbed
i
had
to
say
yes
to
him
for
dad
s
mother
of
course
you
did
darling
don
t
think
about
it
oh
maida
look
the
wind
has
torn
up
the
sycamore
unrooted
it
and
it
has
fallen
over
into
massachusetts
maida
cried
jeffrey
think
what
that
means
allen
was
speechless
yes
the
sycamore
has
gone
into
father
can
go
is
that
real
it
truly
a
permission
of
course
it
is
we
ve
got
governor
appleby
s
letter
saying
when
he
was
governor
you
know
m
so
happy
it
makes
me
forget
that
do
forget
it
all
you
can
dearest
and
beneath
her
lover
s
caresses
maida
did
forget
for
the
moment
at
least
it
s
the
only
inexplicable
thing
about
it
all
fibs
fleming
stone
observed
after
the
case
was
among
the
annals
of
the
past
that
the
old
sycamore
fell
over
and
fell
the
right
mighty
curious
stone
rejoined
the
boy
with
an
expressionless
face
you
didn
t
help
it
along
did
you
you
know
the
injunction
was
without
intervention
of
human
i
didn
t
intervent
my
hands
stone
said
the
boy
earnestly
honest
i
didn
t
wasn
t
nominated
in
the
bond
that
i
shouldn
t
kick
around
those
old
decaying
roots
