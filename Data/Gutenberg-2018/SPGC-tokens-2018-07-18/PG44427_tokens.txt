chateaubriand
was
born
at
malo
in
september
and
died
in
paris
after
an
active
and
most
eventful
career
on
the
fourth
of
july
the
earlier
portion
of
his
life
was
passed
in
the
quiet
of
his
home
at
combourg
at
the
termination
of
his
collegiate
training
at
dole
and
rennes
he
entered
the
army
in
which
he
soon
gained
promotion
at
about
the
age
of
nineteen
he
was
presented
at
court
became
acquainted
with
the
fashionable
world
and
was
received
and
welcomed
into
the
choicest
literary
circles
of
paris
where
he
gained
the
friendship
of
la
harpe
fontanes
malesherbes
and
others
among
the
distinguished
savants
of
that
period
it
was
a
troubled
and
stormy
epoch
in
france
the
social
and
political
forces
which
culminated
in
the
great
revolution
were
beginning
to
be
seriously
felt
and
faction
turbulence
and
anarchy
were
already
rife
in
paris
when
chateaubriand
left
his
native
shores
for
america
moved
by
a
desire
to
discover
the
northwest
passage
but
also
with
an
attendant
purpose
long
cherished
of
observing
the
mode
of
life
and
studying
the
characteristics
of
the
aborigines
for
the
purpose
of
embodying
in
his
writings
the
impressions
thus
gained
of
man
in
a
primitive
condition
from
this
period
to
the
time
of
his
death
his
life
was
a
singular
series
of
vicissitudes
at
one
time
the
brilliant
and
revered
statesman
at
another
the
voluntary
abdicator
of
all
his
rights
and
honors
and
even
at
one
bitter
passage
of
his
existence
living
in
an
unwarmed
london
garret
and
obtaining
a
precarious
livelihood
by
giving
lessons
in
his
native
tongue
and
translating
for
the
booksellers
the
utter
upheaval
of
affairs
in
france
brought
the
greatest
distress
upon
himself
his
family
and
his
immediate
friends
and
with
the
sensitive
heart
of
genius
the
blows
which
had
fallen
so
keenly
doubtless
engendered
the
melancholy
cast
with
which
his
writings
are
sometimes
tinged
his
first
work
an
idyllic
poem
showed
little
of
the
genius
so
finely
developed
in
after
years
but
his
finest
literary
productions
the
martyrs
the
last
of
the
abencerages
and
the
genius
of
christianity
to
which
atala
and
rené
properly
belong
remain
a
splendid
monument
to
his
powers
and
exhibit
his
earnest
desire
to
be
numbered
among
the
benefactors
and
enlighteners
of
mankind
the
present
work
atala
is
the
gathered
fruit
of
his
previous
studies
amid
the
wilds
of
america
it
abounds
in
sparkling
description
romantic
incident
and
sentiments
tender
and
heroic
it
is
pervaded
by
purity
of
tone
and
elevation
of
thought
qualities
the
more
commendable
and
marked
because
produced
in
an
age
proverbially
lax
and
frivolous
the
illustrations
of
doré
have
given
an
additional
value
to
this
tale
so
simple
so
unsophisticated
yet
blooming
with
all
the
wild
luxuriance
of
nature
the
artist
has
added
his
gifts
to
those
of
the
poet
and
those
acquainted
only
with
his
ready
and
original
powers
as
the
delineator
of
farce
and
drollery
or
of
the
exceptionally
tragic
and
horrible
will
find
new
cause
for
admiration
in
these
quiet
renderings
of
the
primeval
beauties
of
the
american
wild
its
plains
and
forests
its
still
lagoons
and
roaring
cataracts
its
mountain
slopes
and
deep
defiles
all
its
aspects
of
rudest
workmanship
and
will
welcome
these
efforts
of
his
genius
in
the
lovely
realm
of
descriptive
art
wedded
as
they
are
to
the
exquisite
simplicity
of
this
indian
romance
as
in
his
other
works
here
may
be
noted
the
same
surpassing
fertility
of
resource
the
same
alertness
of
intellect
and
readiness
and
swiftness
of
touch
but
there
may
also
be
found
new
proofs
of
his
complete
sympathy
with
all
that
is
picturesque
in
forest
beauty
and
his
high
intuitive
perception
of
every
possible
phase
of
nature
in
her
wildest
caprice
and
most
tender
bloom
we
append
the
following
extracts
from
different
prefaces
to
the
author
s
writings
as
constituting
what
is
explanatory
of
the
story
that
follows
from
the
preface
to
the
first
edition
i
was
still
very
young
when
i
conceived
the
idea
of
composing
an
epic
on
the
man
of
nature
to
depict
the
manners
of
savages
by
uniting
them
with
some
event
after
the
discovery
of
america
i
saw
no
subject
more
interesting
especially
to
frenchmen
than
the
massacre
of
the
natchez
colony
in
louisiana
in
all
the
indian
tribes
conspiring
after
two
centuries
of
oppression
for
the
restoration
of
liberty
to
the
new
world
appeared
to
me
to
offer
a
subject
almost
as
attractive
as
the
conquest
of
mexico
i
put
some
fragments
of
the
work
to
paper
but
i
soon
found
that
i
was
weak
in
local
coloring
and
that
if
i
wished
to
produce
a
picture
of
real
resemblance
it
became
necessary
for
me
in
imitation
of
homer
s
example
to
visit
the
tribes
i
was
desirous
of
describing
in
i
made
de
malesherbes
acquainted
with
my
idea
of
going
to
america
but
wishing
at
the
same
time
to
give
a
useful
object
to
my
voyage
i
formed
the
project
of
discovering
the
overland
passage
so
long
sought
after
and
concerning
which
even
captain
cook
himself
had
left
some
doubts
i
started
visited
the
american
solitudes
and
returned
with
plans
for
a
second
voyage
which
was
to
last
nine
years
i
proposed
to
traverse
the
entire
continent
of
north
america
afterwards
to
explore
the
coasts
to
the
north
of
california
and
to
return
by
hudson
s
bay
rounding
the
pole
de
malesherbes
undertook
to
submit
my
plans
to
the
government
and
it
was
then
that
he
listened
to
the
first
fragments
of
the
little
work
i
now
offer
to
the
public
the
revolution
put
a
stop
to
all
my
projects
covered
with
the
blood
of
my
only
brother
of
my
and
of
the
illustrious
old
man
their
father
having
seen
my
mother
and
another
talented
sister
die
in
consequence
of
the
treatment
they
had
undergone
in
prison
i
wandered
forth
to
foreign
lands
where
the
only
friend
i
had
preserved
stabbed
himself
in
my
arms
of
all
my
manuscripts
upon
america
i
have
only
saved
some
fragments
atala
in
particular
which
was
itself
but
an
episode
of
the
atala
was
written
in
the
desert
beneath
the
huts
of
the
savages
i
do
not
know
whether
the
public
will
like
the
story
which
quits
all
beaten
tracks
and
represents
a
nature
and
manners
altogether
foreign
to
europe
there
is
no
adventure
in
it
is
a
sort
of
poem
half
descriptive
half
dramatic
it
consists
entirely
in
the
portraiture
of
two
lovers
walking
and
talking
together
in
the
solitudes
and
in
the
picture
of
the
trials
of
love
in
the
midst
of
the
calm
of
the
desert
i
have
endeavored
to
give
to
this
work
the
most
antique
forms
it
is
divided
into
prologue
recital
and
epilogue
the
principal
parts
of
the
story
have
each
a
denomination
such
as
the
hunters
the
laborers
etc
and
it
was
thus
that
in
the
early
ages
of
greece
the
rhapsodists
sang
under
different
titles
fragments
of
the
iliad
and
the
moralities
i
have
been
desirous
of
inculcating
in
atala
are
easily
discoverable
and
as
they
are
summed
up
in
the
epilogue
i
need
not
speak
of
them
here
i
will
merely
say
a
word
or
two
concerning
chactas
the
lover
of
atala
he
is
a
savage
more
than
half
civilized
since
he
knows
not
only
the
living
but
also
the
dead
languages
of
europe
he
can
therefore
express
himself
in
a
mixed
style
suitable
to
the
line
upon
which
he
stands
between
society
and
nature
this
circumstance
has
given
me
some
advantages
by
permitting
chactas
to
speak
as
a
savage
in
the
description
of
manners
and
as
a
european
in
the
dramatic
portions
of
the
narrative
without
that
the
work
must
have
been
abandoned
if
i
had
always
made
use
of
the
indian
style
atala
would
have
been
hebrew
for
the
reader
as
to
the
missionary
he
is
a
simple
priest
who
speaks
without
blushing
of
the
cross
of
the
blood
of
his
divine
master
of
the
corrupted
flesh
etc
in
one
word
he
is
really
a
priest
i
am
aware
that
it
is
difficult
to
depict
such
a
character
without
awakening
ideas
of
ridicule
in
the
minds
of
certain
readers
where
i
do
not
draw
a
tear
i
may
raise
a
smile
that
must
depend
upon
individual
i
must
say
a
last
word
as
to
the
subject
is
not
entirely
of
my
invention
it
is
certain
that
there
was
a
savage
at
the
galleys
and
at
the
court
of
louis
xiv
it
is
certain
that
a
french
missionary
accomplished
the
facts
i
have
related
it
is
certain
that
i
saw
savages
in
the
american
forests
carrying
away
the
bones
of
their
forefathers
and
a
young
mother
exposing
the
body
of
her
child
upon
the
branches
of
a
tree
some
other
circumstances
narrated
are
also
veritable
but
as
they
are
not
of
general
interest
it
is
needless
for
me
to
speak
of
from
the
preface
to
alain
and
rené
published
in
i
have
been
stopped
in
the
corrections
neither
by
the
consideration
of
the
cost
of
the
book
nor
by
that
of
the
length
of
the
work
a
few
years
have
sufficed
to
make
me
acquainted
with
the
weak
or
defective
portions
of
that
episode
obedient
upon
this
point
to
the
critics
even
so
far
as
to
reproach
myself
with
an
excess
of
docility
i
have
proved
to
those
who
attacked
me
that
i
never
remain
voluntarily
in
error
and
that
at
all
times
and
upon
all
subjects
i
am
ready
to
give
way
to
lights
superior
to
my
own
atala
has
been
reprinted
eleven
times
five
times
separately
and
six
times
in
the
genius
of
if
those
eleven
editions
were
compared
scarcely
two
would
be
found
to
be
altogether
alike
the
twelfth
which
i
now
publish
has
been
revised
with
the
greatest
care
i
have
consulted
the
friends
prompt
to
censure
me
i
have
weighed
each
phrase
examined
every
word
the
style
freed
from
certain
epithets
which
embarrassed
it
proceeds
perhaps
more
naturally
and
with
greater
simplicity
i
have
introduced
more
order
and
logic
into
certain
ideas
and
i
have
effaced
even
the
slightest
inaccuracies
of
language
de
la
harpe
observed
to
me
on
the
subject
of
atala
if
you
will
shut
yourself
up
with
me
only
for
a
few
hours
that
time
will
suffice
for
wiping
out
the
spots
that
cause
your
critics
to
cry
out
so
i
have
passed
four
years
in
the
revision
of
this
episode
but
it
is
now
as
i
intend
it
to
remain
it
is
at
present
the
only
atala
i
shall
ever
in
future
the
new
nature
and
the
new
manners
i
have
described
have
also
drawn
upon
me
another
reproach
i
have
been
taken
for
the
inventor
of
certain
extraordinary
details
whereas
i
merely
repeated
circumstances
well
known
to
all
travellers
some
notes
added
to
the
present
edition
of
atala
would
easily
have
justified
this
assertion
but
if
i
had
introduced
them
at
every
point
where
each
reader
might
have
looked
for
them
they
would
soon
have
exceeded
the
length
of
the
work
itself
i
therefore
gave
up
the
idea
of
illustration
illustration

france
formerly
possessed
in
north

a
vast
empire
extending
from
labrador
to
the
floridas
and
from
the

to
the
most
distant

of

four
great

deriving
their

from

immense

the

unknown
the

into
the

the
river
in
its
course
of
more
than
a
thousand

waters
a
delicious
country
called
by
the
inhabitants
of

the

when
all
these

been
swollen
by
the
deluges
of
winter
uprooted
trees
forming
large
portions
of
forests
torn
down
by
tempests
crowd
about
their
sources
in
a
short
time
the
mud
cements
the
torn

together
and
they
become
enchained
by
creepers
which
taking
root
in
every
direction
bind
and
consolidate
the

carried
away
by
the
foaming
waves
the
rafts
descend
to
the
mississippi
which
taking
possession
of
them
hurries
them
down
towards
the
gulf
of
mexico
throws
them
upon
sandbanks
and
so
increases
the
number
of
its

at

the

raises
its

whilst
passing

resisting
heaps
and
spreads
its
overflowing
waters
around
the
colonnades
of
the
forests
and
the
pyramids
of
the
indian
tombs

so
the

is
the
nile
of
these
deserts

is
always
united
to

their
waves
of

as

gradually
into
the
azure
sky
where
they
fade
away
in
these
limitless
meadows
herds
of
three

cleaving

an
island

ornamented
with
two
crescents
and
its
ancient

slimy
beard
giving
it
the
appearance
of
a
god
of

throwing
an
eye
of
satisfaction
upon
the
grandeur
of
its

and
the

who

these
primitive
fields
of

after
the
discovery
of
the
mississippi
by
father
marquette
and
the
unfortunate
la
salle
the
first
frenchmen
who
established
themselves
at
biloxi
and
at
new
orleans
entered
into
an
alliance
with
the
natchez
an
indian
nation
whose
power
was
redoubtable
in
those
countries
quarrels
and
jealousies
subsequently
ensanguined
the
land
of
hospitality
amongst
these
savages
there
was
an
old
man
named
chactas
who
on
account
of
his
age
wisdom
and
knowledge
of
the
affairs
of
life
was
the
patriarch
and
the
beloved
of
the
deserts
like
many
other
men
he
had
acquired
virtue
by
calamity
not
only
were
the
forests
of
the
new
world
filled
with
his
misfortunes
but
he
bore
the
tale
of
his
calamities
even
to
the
shores
of
france
kept
at
the
galleys
at
marseilles
by
a
cruel
act
of
injustice
restored
to
liberty
and
presented
to
louis
he
had
conversed
with
the
great
men
of
that
age
and
had
been
present
at
the
fêtes
of
versailles
at
the
tragedies
of
racine
and
at
the
funeral
orations
of
bossuet
in
one
word
the
savage
had
contemplated
society
at
the
moment
of
its
greatest
splendor
for
several
years
chactas
restored
to
the
bosom
of
his
country
had
been
in
the
enjoyment
of
repose
nevertheless
providence
granted
him
even
this
favor
dearly
the
old
man
had
become
blind
a
young
girl
used
to
accompany
him
on
the
hills
of
the
mississippi
just
as
antigone
formerly
guided
the
steps
of
odipus
over
the
cithæron
or
as
malvina
conducted
ossian
over
the
rocks
of
morven
in
spite
of
the
numerous
acts
of
injustice
to
which
chactas
had
been
subjected
by
the
french
he
was
very
partial
to
them
he
ever
remembered
fénélon
whose
guest
he
had
been
and
desired
an
opportunity
for
rendering
service
to
the
of
that
virtuous
man
a
favorable
occasion
presented
itself
in
a
frenchman
named
rené
driven
thither
by
his
passions
and
his
misfortunes
arrived
at
louisiana
he
ascended
the
mississippi
as
far
as
the
territory
of
the
natchez
and
asked
to
be
accepted
as
a
warrior
of
that
nation
chactas
having
questioned
him
and
finding
him
not
to
be
shaken
in
his
resolution
adopted
him
as
a
son
and
united
him
to
an
indian
girl
called
céluta
shortly
after
this
marriage
the
savages
prepared
to
go
on
account
of
the
respect
with
which
the
indian
tribes
regarded
the
old
man
chactas
although
blind
was
appointed
by
the
council
of
the
wise
men
to
command
the
expedition
prayers
and
fasts
commenced
the
jugglers
interpreted
the
dreams
the
manitous
were
consulted
sacrifices
of
tobacco
were
offered
up
fillets
of
were
burnt
the
assistants
examining
whether
they
sputtered
in
the
flames
in
order
to
ascertain
the
will
of
the
genii
and
at
length
they
started
after
having
partaken
of
the
sacred
dog

was
of
the
party

harmonious
voice
with
the
assistance
of

pirogues
reascended
the
mississippi
and
reached
the
bed
of
the
ohio
one
moonlight
night
while
all
the
natchez
were
asleep
at
the
bottom
of
their
pirogues
and
the
indian
fleet
under
a
crowd
of
sails
was
flying
before
a
mild
breeze
rené
who
had
remained
alone
with
chactas
asked
him
to
tell
the
story
of
his
adventures
the
old
man
consented
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
and
began
in
these
words

i
the
hunters
the
destiny
which
has
brought
us
together
my
dear
son
is
a
singular
one
i
see
in
you
the
civilized
man
become
savage
you
see
in
me
the
wild
man
whom
the
great
spirit
i
know
not
from
what
motive
desired
to
civilize
having
each
entered
upon
the
career
of
life
from
opposite
directions
you
came
to
repose
yourself
at
my
place
and
i
have
seated
myself
in
yours
so
that
we
must
have
acquired
a
totally
different
view
of
things
which
of
the
twain
has
gained
or
lost
the
more
by
this
change
of
position
that
is
known
to
the
genii
the
least
learned
of
whom
possesses
more
wisdom
than
all
mankind
together
at
the
next
there
will
be
seven
times
ten
snows
and
three
snows
more
since
my
mother
brought
me
into
the
world
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
the
spaniards
had
recently
established
themselves
in
the
bay
of
pensacola
but
no
european
yet
inhabited
louisiana
i
had
scarcely
witnessed
seventeen
falls
of
the
leaves
when
i
marched
with
my
father
the
warrior
outalissi
against
the
muscogulges
a
powerful
nation
in
the
floridas
we
united
our
forces
with
those
of
the
spaniards
our
allies
and
the
combat
took
place
upon
one
of
the
branches
of
the
mobile
areskoui
and
the
manitous
were
not
favorable
to
us
our
enemies
triumphed
my
father
lost
his
life
i
was
twice
wounded
whilst
defending
him
o
why
did
i
not
then
go
down
into
the
land
of
souls
i
should
have
avoided
the
misfortunes
which
were
awaiting
me
on
earth
the
spirits
ordained
otherwise
i
was
dragged
along
by
the
defeated
crowd
to
saint
augustine
the
month
of
way
in
that
city
but
then
recently
built
by
the
spaniards
i
ran
the
risk
of
being
carried
away
to
the
mines
of
mexico
when
an
old
castilian
named
lopez
touched
by
my
youth
and
simplicity
offered
me
an
asylum
and
presented
me
to
his
sister
with
whom
he
was
living
spouseless
both
of
them
took
to
me
in
the
tenderest
manner
i
was
brought
up
with
much
care
and
had
all
sorts
of
masters
given
to
me
but
after
having
passed
thirty
moons
at
saint
augustine
i
was
afflicted
with
a
disgust
for
the
life
of
cities
i
fell
away
visibly
sometimes
i
remained
motionless
for
hours
whilst
contemplating
the
summits
of
distant
forests
at
other
times
i
might
be
seen
seated
on
the
banks
of
a
river
gazing
sadly
upon
the
flowing
waters
i
figured
to
myself
the
woods
through
which
those
waters
had
passed
and
my
soul
was
thus
entirely
given
up
to
solitude
no
longer
able
to
resist
the
desire
of
returning
to
the
desert
i
one
morning
presented
myself
to
lopez
dressed
in
my
savage
attire
holding
in
one
hand
my
bow
and
arrows
and
in
the
other
my
european
costume
which
i
returned
to
my
generous
protector
at
whose
feet
i
fell
shedding
a
torrent
of
tears
giving
myself
odious
names
and
accusing
myself
of
ingratitude
after
all
o
my
father
said
i
to
him
you
see
it
yourself
i
must
die
if
i
do
not
resume
the
life
of
the
lopez
struck
with
astonishment
endeavored
to
change
my
determination
he
spoke
of
the
dangers
i
was
about
to
encounter
by
exposing
myself
to
the
possibility
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
muscogulges
but
perceiving
at
last
that
i
was
resolved
to
risk
everything
he
melted
into
tears
and
pressing
me
in
his
arms
with
affection
go
said
he
child
of
nature
take
back
this
independence
of
man
of
which
lopez
does
not
wish
to
deprive
you
if
i
were
myself
younger
i
would
accompany
you
to
the
desert
where
i
also
have
sweet
remembrances
and
restore
you
to
your
mother
s
arms
when
you
shall
be
once
again
in
your
forests
think
sometimes
of
the
old
spaniard
who
gave
you
hospitality
and
remember
in
order
that
you
may
be
disposed
to
love
your
that
your
first
experience
of
the
human
heart
was
altogether
in
its
lopez
finished
by
a
prayer
to
the
god
of
the
christians
whose
religion
i
had
refused
to
embrace
and
we
separated
with
much
sadness
the
god
of
war
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
punished
for
my
ingratitude
my
inexperience
caused
me
to
lose
myself
in
the
wood
and
i
was
taken
by
a
party
of
muscogulges
and
seminoles
as
lopez
had
predicted
my
dress
and
the
feathers
ornamenting
my
head
caused
me
to
be
recognized
as
a
natchez
illustration
illustration
i
was
enchained
but
slightly
on
account
of
my
youth
simaghan
the
leader
of
the
troop
desired
to
learn
my
name
i
replied
i
am
called
chactas
son
of
outalissi
son
of
miscou
who
have
taken
more
than
a
hundred
scalps
from
the
heroes
of
the
simaghan
then
said
chactas
son
of
outalissi
son
of
miscou
rejoice
thou
shalt
be
burnt
at
the
big
i
answered
that
is
well
and
began
to
chaunt
the
song
of
death
although
a
prisoner
i
could
not
refrain
during
the
first
few
days
from
admiring
my
enemies
the
muscogulge
and
especially
his
ally
the
seminole
is
full
of
gaiety
love
and
contentment
his
walk
is
light
his
mien
calm
and
open
he
speaks
much
and
with
volubility
his
language
is
harmonious
and
flowing
even
age
does
not
deprive
the
sachems
of
this
joyous
simplicity
like
the
old
birds
of
our
forests
they
mingle
their
ancient
songs
with
the
fresh
notes
of
their
young
posterity
the
women
who
accompanied
the
troop
displayed
for
my
youth
a
tender
pity
and
an
amiable
curiosity
they
questioned
me
about
my
mother
concerning
the
earliest
days
of
my
life
and
they
wanted
to
know
whether
my
cradle
of
moss
had
been
hung
upon
the
flowering
branches
of
the
and
whether
the
breezes
had
rocked
me
near
the
nests
of
the
little
birds
then
came
a
thousand
other
questions
as
to
the
state
of
my
heart
they
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
a
white
fawn
in
my
dreams
and
whether
the
trees
of
the
secret
valley
had
advised
me
to
love
i
replied
with
simplicity
to
the
mothers
to
the
daughters
and
to
the
spouses
of
the
men
saying
you
are
the
graces
of
the
day
and
the
night
loves
you
like
dew
man
issues
from
your
loins
to
hang
upon
your
breast
and
upon
your
lips
you
know
the
magic
words
that
lull
every
pain
so
was
i
told
by
her
who
brought
me
into
the
world
and
who
will
never
see
me
again
she
told
me
also
that
maidens
are
mysterious
flowers
met
with
in
solitary
these
praises
gave
much
pleasure
to
the
women
who
overwhelmed
me
with
all
sorts
of
presents
and
brought
me
cream
sugar
saganrite
shells
with
which
to
ornament
myself
and
moss
for
my
couch
they
sang
and
laughed
with
me
and
then
took
to
shedding
tears
at
the
thought
that
i
was
to
be
burnt
a
description
of
cake
made
with
indian
corn
one
night
when
the
muscogulges
had
pitched
their
camp
on
the
outskirt
of
a
forest
i
was
seated
near
the
with
the
guard
who
had
charge
of
me
all
of
a
sudden
i
heard
the
sound
of
a
dress
upon
the
grass
and
a
female
came
and
sat
down
by
my
side
tears
were
rolling
from
beneath
her
eyelids
and
i
saw
by
the
light
of
the
fire
that
a
small
golden
crucifix
shone
upon
her
bosom
she
was
altogether
beautiful
and
i
remarked
upon
her
countenance
an
expression
of
virtue
and
passion
of
irresistible
attraction
to
that
she
added
the
most
tender
graces
an
extreme
sensitiveness
united
to
a
profound
melancholy
breathed
in
her
looks
and
her
smile
was
heavenly
i
took
her
to
be
the
virgin
of
the
last
loves
the
virgin
sent
to
the
prisoner
of
war
to
enchant
his
tomb
under
this
impression
i
said
to
her
stammeringly
and
with
an
emotion
that
did
not
however
proceed
from
any
feeling
of
fear
of
the
funeral
pile
o
virgin
you
are
worthy
of
a
first
love
and
you
are
not
made
for
the
last
the
palpitations
of
a
heart
that
will
soon
cease
to
beat
would
ill
respond
to
the
movements
of
your
own
how
can
death
and
life
lie
mingled
together
you
would
cause
me
to
regret
too
much
the
approach
of
day
let
another
be
happier
than
myself
and
may
long
embraces
unite
the
tender
plant
to
the
oak
the
youthful
maiden
then
said
to
me
i
am
not
the
virgin
of
the
last
loves
are
you
a
christian
i
replied
that
i
had
not
betrayed
the
genii
of
my
cottage
at
these
words
the
indian
made
an
involuntary
movement
and
said
i
pity
you
for
being
merely
a
wicked
idolator
my
mother
made
me
a
christian
my
name
is
atala
and
i
am
the
daughter
of
simaghan
of
the
golden
bracelets
the
chief
of
the
warriors
of
this
troop
we
are
going
to
apalachucla
where
you
will
be
having
uttered
these
words
atala
rose
and
took
her
here
chactas
was
compelled
to
interrupt
his
story
a
crowd
of
souvenirs
rushed
into
his
soul
his
closed
eyes
inundated
his
furrowed
cheeks
with
tears
just
as
two
springs
hidden
in
the
profound
depths
of
the
earth
reveal
themselves
by
the
waters
they
send
filtering
between
the
rocks
oh
my
son
said
he
after
a
long
pause
you
perceive
that
chactas
is
not
very
wise
notwithstanding
his
reputation
for
wisdom
alas
my
dear
child
although
men
can
no
longer
see
they
can
still
weep
several
days
passed
every
evening
the
old
man
s
daughter
came
to
converse
with
me
sleep
had
fled
from
my
eyes
and
atala
was
in
my
heart
like
the
remembrance
of
the
of
my
fathers
on
the
seventeenth
day
of
our
march
about
the
time
when
the
ephemeran
rises
from
the
waters
we
entered
upon
the
grand
savannah
of
alachua
the
plain
is
surrounded
with
hills
which
receding
behind
one
another
are
covered
as
they
appear
to
touch
the
clouds
with
ranges
of
forests
of
magnolias
and
oaks
the
chief
uttered
the
cry
of
arrival
and
the
troop
encamped
at
the
foot
of
a
i
was
left
at
some
distance
on
the
border
of
one
of
those
natural
wells
so
famous
in
the
floridas
attached
to
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
guarded
by
a
warrior
who
watched
me
with
impatience
i
had
passed
but
some
moments
in
this
place
when
atala
appeared
beneath
the
liquid
ambers
of
the
fountain
hunter
said
she
to
the
muscogulgan
hero
if
you
would
like
to
chase
the
stag
i
will
guard
the
the
warrior
jumped
for
joy
at
this
offer
of
the
chiefs
daughter
and
at
once
hurried
from
the
top
of
the
hill
and
directed
his
steps
towards
the
plain
what
a
strange
contradiction
is
the
heart
of
man
i
who
had
so
much
desired
to
speak
of
things
mysterious
to
her
whom
i
already
loved
like
the
sun
suddenly
became
troubled
and
confused
and
felt
as
though
i
should
have
preferred
to
be
thrown
amongst
the
crocodiles
in
the
fountain
to
finding
myself
alone
with
atala
the
daughter
of
the
desert
was
as
much
affected
as
her
prisoner
we
observed
a
profound
silence
for
the
genii
of
love
had
deprived
us
of
speech
after
an
interval
atala
making
an
effort
spoke
thus
warrior
you
are
held
but
slightly
you
can
easily
at
these
words
courage
returned
to
my
tongue
and
i
replied
but
slightly
held
o
woman
i
could
not
complete
my
phrase
atala
hesitated
some
moments
and
then
said
fly
at
the
same
time
liberating
me
from
the
trunk
of
the
tree
i
seized
the
cord
and
returned
it
to
the
hand
of
the
foreign
maiden
forcing
her
beautiful
fingers
to
close
themselves
upon
my
chain
take
it
back
take
it
back
i
cried
you
are
mad
said
atala
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
wretched
man
do
you
not
know
that
you
will
be
burnt
what
do
you
mean
do
you
reflect
that
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
redoubtable
sachem
there
was
a
time
i
replied
with
tears
when
i
also
was
carried
about
in
a
on
the
shoulders
of
a
mother
my
father
also
had
a
fine
cottage
and
his
fawns
drank
of
the
waters
of
a
thousand
torrents
but
i
now
wander
without
a
country
when
i
shall
have
ceased
to
exist
no
friend
will
place
a
little
grass
over
my
body
to
keep
the
insects
away
from
it
the
corpse
of
an
unhappy
stranger
interests
no
these
words
touched
atala
her
tears
fell
into
the
fountain
ah
i
continued
with
vivacity
if
your
heart
spoke
like
mine
is
not
the
desert
free
do
not
the
forests
contain
folds
in
which
we
could
conceal
ourselves
and
in
order
to
be
happy
are
there
so
many
things
necessary
for
the
children
of
the
huts
o
maiden
more
beautiful
than
the
first
dream
of
a
spouse
o
my
dare
to
follow
me
such
was
my
language
atala
replied
to
me
in
a
tender
tone
of
voice
my
young
friend
you
have
learnt
the
expressions
of
the
white
men
it
is
easy
to
deceive
an
indian
girl
what
i
exclaimed
you
call
me
your
young
friend
ah
if
a
poor
slave
well
said
she
leaning
upon
me
a
poor
slave
i
continued
with
ardor
let
a
kiss
assure
him
of
your
faith
atala
listened
to
my
prayers
as
a
fawn
appears
to
cling
to
the
flowers
of
the
rosy
creepers
which
it
seizes
with
its
delicate
tongue
on
the
so
i
remained
attached
to
the
lips
of
my
illustration
alas
my
dear
son
pain
is
in
close
attendance
upon
pleasure
who
could
have
thought
that
the
moment
in
which
atala
gave
me
the
first
token
of
her
love
should
be
precisely
that
in
which
she
would
destroy
all
my
hopes
white
hairs
of
old
chactas
what
was
your
astonishment
when
the
daughter
of
the
sachem
pronounced
these
words
beautiful
prisoner
i
have
foolishly
given
way
to
your
desire
but
whither
will
this
passion
lead
us
my
religion
separates
me
from
you
for
ever
oh
my
mother
what
hast
thou
done
atala
became
suddenly
silent
and
kept
back
i
know
not
what
fatal
secret
about
to
escape
from
her
lips
her
words
plunged
me
into
despair
well
then
i
exclaimed
i
will
be
as
cruel
as
you
i
will
not
escape
you
shall
see
me
in
the
flame
of
fire
you
shall
hear
the
groans
of
my
flesh
and
you
will
be
full
of
atala
took
my
hands
between
both
of
hers
poor
young
idolator
she
cried
i
really
grieve
for
you
you
wish
me
then
to
weep
my
whole
heart
out
what
a
pity
i
can
not
fly
with
you
unhappy
was
the
bosom
of
thy
mother
o
atala
why
dost
thou
not
throw
thyself
to
the
crocodiles
in
the
fountain
that
very
moment
the
crocodiles
at
the
approach
of
the
setting
of
the
sun
began
to
make
their
cries
heard
atala
said
to
me
let
us
leave
this
i
led
away
the
daughter
of
simaghan
to
the
foot
of
the
hills
which
form
gulfs
of
verdure
by
advancing
their
promontories
into
the
savannahs
everything
in
the
desert
was
splendidly
imposing
the
stork
was
screaming
upon
its
nest
the
woods
resounded
with
the
monotonous
song
of
the
quails
the
whistling
of
the
paraquets
the
lowing
of
the
bisons
and
the
neighing
of
the
siminolian
cavalry
our
promenade
was
almost
a
dumb
one
i
walked
by
the
side
of
atala
who
was
holding
the
end
of
the
cord
which
i
had
forced
her
to
take
back
again
sometimes
we
shed
tears
and
sometimes
we
endeavored
to
smile
a
look
now
directed
towards
the
sky
and
then
towards
the
earth
an
ear
listening
to
the
song
of
the
birds
a
gesture
towards
the
setting
sun
a
hand
tenderly
pressed
a
bosom
by
turns
palpitating
and
tranquil
the
names
of
chactas
and
atala
softly
repeated
at
intervals
oh
first
promenade
of
love
thy
souvenir
must
be
extremely
powerful
since
after
so
many
years
of
misfortune
it
can
still
stir
the
heart
of
old
chactas
how
incomprehensible
are
mortals
when
agitated
by
the
passions
i
had
just
abandoned
the
lopez
i
had
just
exposed
myself
to
every
danger
for
the
sake
of
liberty
and
in
one
instant
the
look
of
a
woman
had
changed
my
tastes
my
resolutions
my
thoughts
forgetful
of
my
country
my
mother
my
cabin
and
the
frightful
death
awaiting
me
i
had
become
indifferent
to
everything
that
was
not
atala
lacking
strength
to
raise
myself
to
the
reason
of
a
man
i
had
suddenly
fallen
into
a
sort
of
childishness
and
far
from
being
able
to
do
anything
to
extricate
myself
from
threatening
misfortunes
i
almost
required
some
one
to
provide
me
with
the
means
of
sleep
and
nourishment
it
was
therefore
in
vain
that
atala
after
our
ramble
in
the
savannah
threw
herself
at
my
knees
and
again
begged
me
to
leave
her
i
declared
that
i
would
return
alone
to
the
camp
if
she
refused
to
me
to
the
trunk
of
my
tree
she
was
compelled
to
comply
with
my
request
hoping
to
convince
me
another
time
the
next
day
which
decided
the
fate
of
my
life
we
halted
in
a
valley
not
far
from
cuscowilla
the
capital
of
the
seminoles
these
indians
together
with
the
muscogulges
form
the
confederation
of
the
creeks
the
daughter
of
the
land
of
came
to
find
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
conducted
me
to
a
great
and
renewed
her
entreaties
to
induce
me
to
escape
without
replying
to
her
i
took
her
hand
in
mine
and
forced
the
thirsting
fawn
to
wander
with
me
into
the
forest
the
night
was
delicious
the
genius
of
the
air
appeared
to
be
shaking
the
blue
canopy
embalmed
with
the
odor
of
the
pines
and
we
breathed
a
slight
perfume
of
amber
emitted
by
the
crocodiles
asleep
beneath
the
by
the
the
moon
was
shining
in
the
midst
of
a
spotless
azure
and
the
light
fell
upon
the
undefined
summit
of
the
forests
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
except
i
know
not
what
distant
harmony
that
reigned
in
the
depth
of
the
woods
it
seemed
as
though
the
soul
of
solitude
was
sighing
throughout
the
entire
extent
of
the
desert
through
the
trees
we
perceived
a
young
man
who
holding
a
torch
in
his
hand
looked
like
the
genius
of
spring
visiting
the
forests
to
reanimate
nature
he
was
a
lover
on
his
way
to
learn
his
fate
at
the
cabin
of
his
mistress
should
the
maiden
blow
out
the
torch
she
accepts
the
offered
vows
but
if
she
veil
herself
without
extinguishing
it
she
refuses
the
spouse
the
warrior
gliding
through
the
shades
chanted
these
words
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
i
will
outrun
the
steps
of
the
daylight
upon
the
to
seek
my
lonely
dove
in
the
midst
of
the
oaks
of
the
forest
i
have
fastened
around
her
throat
a
necklace
of
porcelain
with
three
red
beads
for
my
love
three
violet
ones
for
my
fears
three
blue
ones
for
my
hopes
a
necklace
of
shells
mila
has
the
eyes
of
an
ermine
and
hair
as
light
as
a
field
of
rice
her
mouth
is
a
pink
shell
lined
with
pearls
her
two
breasts
are
like
two
little
spotless
kids
born
the
same
day
of
one
mother
illustration
may
mila
extinguish
this
torch
may
her
mouth
cast
a
voluptuous
shade
over
it
i
will
fertilize
her
bosom
the
hope
of
the
country
shall
hang
from
her
fruitful
breast
and
i
will
smoke
my
calumet
of
peace
by
the
cradle
of
my
son
ah
let
me
outrun
the
steps
of
the
daylight
upon
the
to
seek
my
lonely
dove
amidst
the
oaks
of
the
forest
thus
sang
this
young
man
whose
accents
agitated
me
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
and
caused
atala
to
chance
countenance
our
united
hands
trembled
in
each
other
but
we
were
diverted
from
this
scene
by
another
scene
not
less
dangerous
for
us
we
passed
near
a
child
s
tomb
which
served
as
a
boundary
between
two
nations
it
had
been
placed
on
the
border
of
the
road
according
to
custom
in
order
that
the
young
wives
when
going
to
the
fountain
might
draw
into
their
bosom
the
soul
of
the
innocent
creature
and
restore
it
to
the
country
at
this
moment
several
spouses
were
there
and
desirous
of
the
sweets
of
maternity
were
endeavoring
by
opening
their
lips
to
receive
the
soul
of
the
little
child
which
they
fancied
they
saw
wandering
amongst
the
flowers
the
veritable
mother
came
afterwards
and
deposited
a
bunch
of
corn
and
white
lilies
upon
the
tomb
she
sprinkled
the
earth
with
her
milk
sat
down
upon
the
damp
turf
and
spoke
thus
to
her
child
in
an
impassioned
voice
why
do
i
weep
for
thee
in
thy
earthly
cradle
o
my
when
the
little
bird
has
grown
it
must
seek
its
own
nutriment
and
finds
many
bitter
seeds
in
the
desert
at
least
thou
hast
been
unconscious
of
tears
at
least
thy
heart
has
not
been
exposed
to
the
devouring
breath
of
men
the
bud
that
dries
up
in
its
envelope
passes
away
with
all
its
perfumes
like
thou
o
my
son
with
all
thine
innocence
happy
are
those
who
die
in
the
cradle
they
have
only
known
the
kisses
and
smiles
of
a
mother
already
subdued
by
our
own
hearts
we
were
overwhelmed
by
the
images
of
love
and
maternity
which
seemed
to
pursue
us
in
these
enchanted
solitudes
i
carried
atala
away
in
my
arms
to
the
extremity
of
the
forest
where
i
told
her
things
that
i
should
in
vain
endeavor
to
repeat
with
my
lips
the
southern
wind
my
dear
son
loses
its
heat
on
passing
over
mountains
of
ice
the
souvenirs
of
love
in
the
heart
of
an
old
man
are
like
the
fires
of
day
reflected
by
the
peaceful
orb
of
the
moon
when
the
sun
has
set
and
silence
spreads
itself
over
the
huts
of
the
savages
what
could
save
atala
what
could
prevent
her
from
succumbing
to
nature
nothing
doubtless
but
a
miracle
and
that
miracle
was
accomplished
the
daughter
of
simaghan
had
recourse
to
the
god
of
the
christians
she
threw
herself
upon
the
ground
and
uttered
a
fervent
prayer
addressed
to
her
mother
and
to
the
queen
of
virgins
it
was
from
this
moment
o
rené
that
i
entertained
a
wonderful
idea
of
that
religion
which
in
the
forests
in
the
midst
of
all
the
privations
of
life
imparts
a
thousand
boons
to
the
unfortunate
of
that
religion
which
opposing
its
power
to
the
torrent
of
the
passions
suffices
alone
to
conquer
them
when
everything
else
is
in
their
favor
the
secrecy
of
the
woods
the
absence
of
men
and
the
fidelity
of
the
shades
ah
how
divine
to
me
appeared
that
simple
savage
the
ignorant
atala
who
on
her
knees
before
an
old
fallen
as
at
the
foot
of
an
altar
was
offering
up
a
prayer
to
her
god
in
favor
of
an
idolatrous
lover
her
eyes
raised
towards
the
star
of
the
night
her
cheeks
brilliant
with
tears
of
religion
and
of
love
were
of
immortal
beauty
several
times
it
appeared
to
me
as
though
she
were
about
to
take
her
flight
to
heaven
several
times
i
fancied
i
saw
come
down
upon
the
rays
of
the
moon
and
heard
amidst
the
trees
those
genii
whom
the
god
of
the
christians
sends
to
the
hermits
of
the
rocks
when
he
is
about
to
call
them
back
to
himself
i
was
afflicted
by
all
this
for
i
feared
that
atala
had
but
little
time
to
remain
on
earth
nevertheless
she
shed
such
abundant
tears
she
appeared
so
unhappy
that
i
was
perhaps
upon
the
point
of
consenting
to
take
my
departure
when
the
cry
of
death
resounded
through
the
forest
four
armed
men
rushed
upon
me
we
had
been
discovered
the
had
given
orders
for
our
pursuit
atala
who
resembled
a
queen
in
the
pride
of
her
demeanor
disdained
to
speak
to
these
warriors
she
glanced
nobly
at
them
and
went
forthwith
to
simaghan
she
could
obtain
no
concession
my
guards
were
doubled
my
chains
increased
and
my
lover
was
kept
away
from
me
five
nights
passed
and
then
we
perceived
apalachucla
situated
on
the
banks
of
the
river
i
was
immediately
crowned
with
flowers
my
face
was
painted
blue
and
red
beads
were
fastened
to
my
nose
and
to
my
ears
and
a
chichikoué
was
placed
in
my
hand
thus
prepared
for
the
sacrifice
i
entered
apalachucla
amidst
the
reiterated
shouts
of
the
crowd
my
fate
was
sealed
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
sound
of
a
conch
was
heard
and
the
mico
or
chief
of
the
nation
ordered
an
assembly
you
know
my
son
the
torments
to
which
savages
subject
their
prisoners
of
war
christian
missionaries
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
and
with
an
indefatigable
charity
had
succeeded
in
inducing
several
nations
to
substitute
a
comparatively
mild
slavery
to
the
horrors
of
the
funeral
pile
the
muscogulges
had
not
yet
adopted
this
custom
but
a
numerous
party
amongst
them
had
declared
themselves
in
favor
of
it
it
was
to
decide
upon
this
important
matter
that
the
mico
had
convoked
the
sachems
or
wise
men
i
was
conducted
to
the
place
of
deliberation
the
pavilion
of
the
council
was
situated
upon
an
isolated
mound
not
far
from
apalachucla
three
circles
of
columns
constituted
the
elegant
architecture
of
this
rotunda
the
columns
were
of
polished
and
carved
increasing
in
height
and
in
thickness
and
diminishing
in
number
as
they
approached
the
centre
which
was
indicated
by
a
single
pillar
from
the
summit
of
this
pillar
depended
strips
of
bark
which
passing
over
the
tops
of
the
other
columns
covered
the
pavilion
in
the
guise
of
an
open
fan
a
musical
instrument
played
by
the
savages
the
council
assembled
fifty
old
men
in
beaver
cloaks
were
ranged
upon
the
steps
facing
the
door
of
the
pavilion
the
grand
chief
was
seated
in
their
midst
holding
in
his
hand
the
calumet
of
peace
for
war
on
the
right
of
the
old
men
were
placed
fifty
women
dressed
in
robes
of
the
with
a
tomahawk
in
the
hand
a
bunch
of
feathers
on
the
head
and
their
arms
and
chests
dyed
with
blood
occupied
the
left
at
the
foot
of
the
central
column
the
fire
of
the
council
was
burning
the
first
jungler
surrounded
by
eight
guardians
of
the
temple
dressed
in
long
vestments
and
wearing
a
stuffed
owl
upon
their
heads
poured
some
balm
of
copal
upon
the
flames
and
offered
a
sacrifice
to
the
sun
the
triple
row
of
old
men
matrons
and
warriors
the
priests
the
clouds
of
incense
and
the
sacrifice
imparted
to
this
council
an
aspect
altogether
imposing
illustration
i
was
standing
chained
in
the
midst
of
the
assembly
when
the
sacrifice
was
finished
the
mico
spoke
and
explained
with
simplicity
the
affair
that
had
brought
the
council
together
he
threw
a
blue
necklace
upon
the
ground
as
evidence
of
what
he
had
just
said
then
a
sachem
of
the
tribe
of
the
eagle
rose
and
spoke
thus
my
father
the
mico
sachems
matrons
warriors
of
the
four
tribes
of
the
eagle
the
beaver
the
serpent
and
the
tortoise
let
us
change
nothing
in
the
manners
of
our
forefathers
let
us
burn
the
prisoner
and
let
us
not
allow
our
courage
to
be
weakened
it
is
a
custom
of
the
white
men
that
is
now
proposed
to
you
it
can
not
be
other
than
pernicious
give
a
red
collar
which
contains
my
words
i
have
and
he
threw
a
red
collar
into
the
midst
of
the
assembly
a
matron
then
rose
and
said
my
father
eagle
you
have
the
cleverness
of
a
fox
and
the
prudent
slowness
of
a
tortoise
i
will
polish
the
chain
of
friendship
with
you
and
we
will
plant
together
the
tree
of
peace
but
let
us
change
the
customs
of
our
forefathers
when
they
are
of
a
terrible
character
let
us
have
slaves
to
cultivate
our
fields
and
let
us
no
longer
hear
the
cries
of
the
prisoners
which
trouble
the
bosoms
of
the
mothers
i
have
as
the
waves
of
the
ocean
are
broken
up
by
a
storm
as
in
autumn
the
dried
leaves
are
carried
away
in
a
whirlwind
as
the
reeds
of
the
mississippi
bend
and
rise
again
during
a
sudden
inundation
as
a
great
herd
of
deer
bellow
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
so
was
the
council
agitated
and
murmuring
sachems
warriors
and
matrons
spoke
by
turns
or
all
together
interests
clashed
opinions
were
divided
and
the
council
was
about
to
be
dissolved
but
at
length
the
ancient
custom
prevailed
and
i
was
condemned
to
the
pile
a
circumstance
caused
my
punishment
to
be
delayed
the
feast
of
the
dead
or
the
festival
of
souls
was
approaching
and
it
is
the
custom
not
to
put
any
captive
to
death
during
the
days
consecrated
to
that
ceremony
i
was
handed
over
to
a
strict
guard
and
doubtless
the
sachems
had
sent
away
the
daughter
of
simaghan
as
i
saw
her
no
longer
meanwhile
the
tribes
for
more
than
three
hundred
leagues
around
came
in
crowds
to
celebrate
the
festival
of
souls
a
long
hut
had
been
constructed
upon
an
isolated
situation
on
the
day
indicated
each
cabin
exhumed
the
remains
of
its
fathers
from
their
private
tombs
and
the
skeletons
were
hung
upon
the
walls
of
the
of
the
ancestors
in
order
and
by
families
the
winds
a
tempest
had
burst
forth
the
forests
and
the
cataracts
roared
from
without
while
the
old
men
of
the
different
nations
were
engaged
in
concluding
treaties
of
peace
between
the
tribes
over
the
bones
of
their
fathers
funeral
amusements
were
indulged
in
running
ball
and
a
game
with
small
bones
two
maidens
tried
to
snatch
from
each
other
a
their
hands
fluttered
about
the
twig
which
each
in
her
turn
held
above
her
head
their
beautiful
naked
feet
intertwined
their
mouths
met
their
sweet
breaths
became
confounded
they
stooped
and
their
hairs
were
mixed
together
then
they
looked
at
their
mothers
and
blushed
in
the
midst
of
applause
the
jungler
invoked
michabou
the
genius
of
the
waters
and
related
the
wars
of
the
great
hare
against
machimanitou
the
god
of
evil
he
spoke
of
the
first
man
and
of
athaënsic
the
first
woman
being
hurled
from
heaven
for
having
lost
their
innocence
of
the
earth
having
been
reddened
with
a
brother
s
blood
of
the
immolation
of
tahouistsarou
by
the
impious
jouskeka
of
the
deluge
commanded
by
the
voice
of
the
great
spirit
of
massou
the
only
one
saved
in
his
bark
vessel
and
of
the
crow
sent
out
to
discover
the
land
he
spoke
moreover
of
the
beautiful
endaë
recalled
from
the
land
of
souls
by
the
sweet
songs
of
her
spouse
after
these
games
and
hymns
preparations
were
made
for
giving
the
ancestors
an
eternal
sepulture
upon
the
borders
of
the
river
there
was
a
wild
which
the
worship
of
the
people
had
consecrated
the
indian
maidens
were
in
the
habit
of
washing
their
at
this
place
and
exposing
them
to
the
breath
of
the
desert
upon
the
branches
of
the
ancient
tree
it
was
there
that
an
immense
tomb
had
been
dug
while
leaving
the
funeral
chamber
the
hymn
of
death
was
sung
each
family
carried
some
sacred
remains
on
arriving
at
the
tomb
the
relics
were
lowered
down
into
it
and
spread
out
in
layers
separated
by
the
skins
of
bears
and
beavers
the
mound
of
the
tomb
was
then
raised
and
the
tree
of
tears
and
of
sleep
planted
upon
it
let
us
pity
men
my
dear
son
those
very
indians
whose
customs
are
so
touching
those
very
women
who
had
displayed
such
a
tender
interest
in
my
behalf
now
called
out
loudly
for
my
execution
and
entire
tribes
delayed
their
departure
in
order
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
young
man
undergo
the
most
horrible
sufferings
in
a
valley
to
the
north
at
some
distance
from
the
grand
village
was
a
wood
of
cypresses
and
deals
called
the
wood
of
blood
it
was
reached
by
the
ruins
of
one
of
those
monuments
of
which
the
origin
is
ignored
and
which
were
the
work
of
a
people
now
unknown
i
was
led
thither
in
triumph
preparations
were
being
made
for
my
death
the
pole
of
areskoui
was
planted
pine
elm
and
fell
beneath
the
axe
the
funeral
pile
was
rising
and
spectators
were
constructing
amphitheatres
with
the
branches
and
trunks
of
trees
each
one
was
occupied
in
inventing
a
torture
some
proposed
to
tear
the
skin
off
my
head
others
to
burn
my
eyes
out
with
axes
i
began
to
sing
the
song
of
death
blushing
is
a
marked
characteristic
with
young
savages
i
do
not
fear
torture
i
am
brave
o
muscognlges
i
defy
you
i
despise
you
more
than
women
my
father
outalissi
son
of
miscou
drank
out
of
the
skulls
of
your
most
famous
warriors
you
will
not
draw
a
sigh
from
my
provoked
by
my
song
a
warrior
pierced
my
arm
with
an
arrow
i
merely
said
brother
i
thank
in
spite
of
the
activity
of
the
executioners
the
preparations
for
my
execution
could
not
be
completed
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
a
jungler
was
consulted
and
he
forbade
the
genii
of
the
shades
to
be
troubled
so
that
my
death
was
postponed
till
the
following
day
but
in
their
impatience
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
and
in
order
to
be
ready
sooner
on
the
break
of
day
the
indians
did
not
quit
the
wood
of
blood
they
lighted
large
fires
and
began
a
series
of
festivities
and
dances
illustration
meanwhile
i
had
been
laid
down
upon
my
back
cords
from
my
neck
from
my
feet
and
from
my
arms
were
attached
to
stakes
fixed
in
the
ground
warriors
were
seated
upon
these
cords
and
i
could
not
make
the
slightest
movement
without
their
knowledge
the
night
advanced
the
songs
and
dances
gradually
ceased
the
fires
emitted
but
a
ruddy
light
in
front
of
which
i
could
see
the
shadows
of
some
of
the
savages
pass
at
last
they
all
fell
asleep
but
as
the
noise
of
men
became
pacified
that
of
the
desert
seemed
to
increase
and
to
the
tumult
of
voices
succeeded
the
howlings
of
the
winds
in
the
forest
it
was
the
hour
when
a
young
indian
recently
become
a
mother
awakes
with
a
start
in
the
middle
of
the
night
fancying
she
has
heard
the
cry
of
her
babe
desirous
of
her
sweet
nutriment
with
my
eyes
gazing
up
to
heaven
where
the
crescent
moon
was
wandering
in
the
clouds
i
was
reflecting
upon
my
destiny
atala
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
monster
of
ingratitude
thus
to
abandon
me
at
the
moment
of
punishment
i
who
had
given
myself
up
to
the
flames
rather
than
leave
her
and
yet
i
felt
that
i
still
loved
her
and
that
i
should
die
with
joy
for
atala
in
extreme
pleasures
there
is
a
sting
that
excites
one
as
though
to
counsel
us
to
profit
by
the
rapidly
passing
moment
in
great
grief
on
the
contrary
there
is
something
heavy
that
induces
drowsiness
the
eyes
fatigued
with
tears
naturally
seek
to
close
and
the
goodness
of
providence
may
be
thus
remarked
even
in
our
misfortunes
i
gave
way
in
spite
of
myself
to
that
heavy
sleep
which
sometimes
overcomes
the
wretched
i
dreamt
that
my
chains
were
being
taken
off
i
thought
i
felt
the
satisfaction
experienced
when
after
having
been
tightly
pressed
a
helping
hand
relieves
us
of
our
irons
this
sensation
was
so
vivid
that
it
caused
me
to
raise
my
eyelids
by
the
light
of
the
moon
a
ray
of
which
was
escaping
between
two
clouds
i
saw
a
tall
white
figure
leaning
over
me
and
silently
occupied
in
loosening
my
bonds
i
was
about
to
utter
a
cry
when
a
hand
which
i
instantly
recognized
closed
my
mouth
a
single
cord
remained
but
it
appeared
impossible
to
cut
it
without
touching
a
warrior
who
covered
it
entirely
with
his
body
atala
placed
her
hand
upon
it
the
warrior
bestirred
himself
and
sat
up
atala
remained
motionless
and
looked
at
him
the
indian
thought
he
was
looking
at
the
spirit
of
the
ruins
and
he
lay
down
again
closing
his
eyes
and
invoking
his
manitou
the
bond
was
broken
i
arose
and
followed
my
deliverer
who
tendered
to
me
the
end
of
a
bow
of
which
she
held
the
other
extremity
but
with
what
dangers
were
we
surrounded
at
times
we
were
on
the
point
of
stumbling
over
the
sleeping
savages
then
a
guard
questioned
us
and
atala
replied
in
an
assumed
voice
children
were
crying
and
dogs
barking
scarcely
had
we
got
clear
of
the
fatal
enclosure
when
terrible
howlings
resounded
through
the
forest
the
camp
was
aroused
a
thousand
fires
were
lighted
and
savages
were
running
about
in
all
directions
with
torches
we
hurried
away
with
precipitation
when
day
broke
upon
the
apalaches
we
were
already
far
away
great
was
my
felicity
on
finding
myself
again
in
solitude
with
atala
with
atala
my
deliverer
with
atala
who
was
giving
herself
to
me
for
ever
words
failed
my
tongue
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
said
to
the
daughter
of
simaghan
men
are
but
little
but
when
the
genii
visit
them
they
are
nothing
at
all
you
are
a
genius
you
have
visited
me
and
i
can
not
speak
before
atala
offered
me
her
hand
with
a
smile
i
am
obliged
to
follow
you
she
said
since
you
will
not
fly
without
me
during
the
night
i
seduced
the
jungler
with
presents
i
intoxicated
your
executioners
with
essence
of
fire
and
i
risked
my
life
for
you
because
you
had
given
yours
for
me
yes
young
idolator
she
added
with
an
accent
that
alarmed
me
the
sacrifice
will
be
atala
gave
me
the
weapons
she
had
had
the
precaution
to
bring
and
then
she
dressed
my
wound
whilst
wiping
it
with
a
she
wetted
it
with
her
tears
it
is
a
balm
i
said
to
her
that
you
are
dropping
on
my
i
am
rather
afraid
that
it
may
be
a
poison
she
replied
she
tore
one
of
the
coverings
from
her
bosom
with
which
she
made
a
first
bandage
that
she
fastened
with
a
tress
of
lier
hair
intoxication
which
lasts
a
long
time
upon
savages
and
is
for
them
a
species
of
malady
prevented
them
from
pursuing
us
during
the
first
few
days
if
they
sought
for
us
afterwards
it
was
probably
in
a
westerly
direction
as
they
must
have
thought
we
should
make
for
the
mississippi
but
we
had
taken
our
flight
towards
the
fixed
star
guiding
ourselves
by
the
moss
on
the
trunks
of
the
trees
brandy
the
north
we
were
not
long
in
perceiving
that
we
had
gained
but
little
by
my
deliverance
the
desert
now
unrolled
before
us
its
immeasurable
solitudes
without
experience
in
forest
life
having
lost
our
way
and
walking
on
at
hazard
what
was
to
become
of
us
often
while
gazing
upon
atala
i
remembered
the
ancient
story
of
agar
that
lopez
had
given
me
to
read
and
which
happened
in
the
desert
of
beersheba
a
long
time
ago
when
men
lived
to
three
times
the
age
of
the
oak
atala
made
me
a
cloak
out
of
some
and
she
also
embroidered
me
a
pair
of
musk
rat
skin
moccasins
with
porcupine
s
hair
in
my
turn
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
ornament
her
attire
first
of
all
i
placed
upon
her
head
a
crown
of
those
blue
mallows
that
crowded
beneath
our
feet
in
the
abandoned
indian
cemeteries
then
i
made
her
necklaces
of
red
and
after
all
i
smiled
in
the
contemplation
of
her
wonderful
beauty
when
we
encountered
a
river
we
crossed
it
either
on
a
raft
or
by
swimming
atala
placed
one
of
her
hands
upon
my
shoulder
and
thus
like
a
pair
of
migratory
swans
we
traversed
the
solitary
waves
during
the
great
heat
of
the
day
we
often
sought
shelter
beneath
the
moss
of
the
cedars
nearly
all
the
floridan
trees
especially
the
cedar
and
the
oak
are
covered
with
a
white
moss
which
descends
from
their
branches
down
to
the
very
ground
at
by
moonlight
should
you
happen
to
see
in
the
open
savannah
an
isolated
holm
dressed
in
such
drapery
you
would
imagine
it
to
be
a
phantom
dragging
after
it
a
number
of
long
veils
the
scene
is
not
less
picturesque
by
day
when
a
crowd
of
butterflies
brilliant
insects
colibris
green
paroquets
and
blue
jackdaws
entangle
themselves
amongst
the
moss
and
thus
produce
the
effect
of
a
piece
of
white
woollen
tapestry
embroidered
by
some
clever
european
workman
with
beautiful
birds
and
sparkling
insects
illustration
illustration
it
was
in
the
shade
of
such
smiling
quarters
prepared
by
the
great
spirit
that
we
stopped
to
repose
ourselves
when
the
winds
come
down
from
heaven
to
rock
the
great
cedar
when
the
aerial
castles
built
upon
its
brandies
undulate
with
the
birds
and
the
travellers
sleeping
beneath
its
shelter
when
thousands
of
sighs
pass
through
the
corridors
of
the
waving
edifice
there
is
nothing
amongst
the
wonders
of
the
ancient
world
to
be
compared
with
this
monument
of
the
desert
every
evening
we
lighted
a
large
fire
and
built
a
travelling
hut
of
bark
raised
upon
four
stakes
when
i
had
killed
a
wild
turkey
a
pigeon
or
a
we
attached
it
to
the
end
of
a
pole
before
a
pile
of
burning
oak
and
left
the
care
of
turning
the
hunter
s
prey
to
the
caprices
of
the
wind
we
used
to
eat
a
kind
of
moss
called
sweetened
bark
and
that
tasted
of
the
peach
and
the
raspberry
the
the
and
the
sumach
furnished
our
table
with
wine
sometimes
i
went
and
fetched
from
amongst
the
reeds
a
plant
whose
flower
in
the
form
of
an
elongated
cup
contained
a
glass
of
the
purest
dew
we
blessed
heaven
for
having
placed
this
limpid
spring
upon
the
stalk
of
a
flower
in
the
midst
of
the
corrupted
marshes
just
as
it
has
placed
hope
at
the
bottom
of
hearts
ulcerated
by
grief
just
also
as
it
has
caused
virtue
to
well
up
from
the
bosom
of
the
miseries
of
life
i
soon
discovered
alas
that
i
had
deceived
myself
as
to
the
apparent
calm
of
my
beloved
atala
the
farther
we
advanced
the
sadder
she
became
she
frequently
shuddered
without
a
cause
and
turned
her
head
aside
hurriedly
i
sometimes
caught
her
regarding
me
with
a
passionate
look
which
she
at
once
cast
towards
the
sky
with
a
profound
melancholy
what
alarmed
me
above
all
was
a
secret
thought
concealed
in
the
bottom
of
her
soul
but
which
i
read
in
her
eyes
constantly
drawing
me
towards
her
and
then
pushing
me
away
my
hopes
and
then
destroying
them
when
i
thought
i
had
made
some
progress
in
her
heart
i
found
myself
still
at
the
same
point
how
many
times
she
said
to
me
o
my
young
sweetheart
i
love
you
like
the
shade
of
the
woods
at
you
are
as
beautiful
as
the
desert
with
all
its
flowers
and
all
its
breezes
if
i
incline
towards
you
i
tremble
when
my
hand
falls
upon
yours
it
seems
to
me
as
though
i
were
about
to
die
the
other
day
the
wind
blew
your
hair
upon
my
face
as
you
were
reposing
yourself
upon
my
bosom
and
i
fancied
i
felt
the
light
touch
of
the
invisible
spirits
yes
i
have
seen
the
young
kids
of
the
mountain
of
occona
i
have
listened
to
the
language
of
men
ripe
with
years
but
the
mildness
of
goats
and
the
wisdom
of
old
men
are
less
agreeable
and
less
powerful
than
your
words
ah
my
poor
chactas
i
shall
never
be
your
spouse
the
constant
struggle
between
atala
s
love
and
religion
her
tender
freedom
and
the
chastity
of
her
conduct
the
pride
of
her
character
and
her
profound
sensitiveness
the
elevation
of
her
soul
in
great
things
her
susceptibility
about
trifles
rendered
her
in
my
opinion
an
incomprehensible
being
atala
could
not
hold
a
weak
empire
over
a
man
full
of
passion
she
was
full
of
power
she
must
either
be
adored
or
hated
after
fifteen
nights
of
hurried
march
we
entered
upon
the
chain
of
the
alleghany
mountains
and
reached
one
of
the
branches
of
the
tennessee
a
river
that
falls
into
the
ohio
aided
by
the
advice
of
atala
i
built
a
boat
which
i
coated
with
gum
after
having
the
bark
with
roots
of
the
fir
i
subsequently
embarked
therein
with
atala
and
we
abandoned
ourselves
to
the
current
of
the
river
the
indian
village
of
sticoë
with
its
pyramidal
tombs
and
ruined
huts
appeared
on
our
left
at
the
turn
of
a
promontory
on
the
right
we
left
the
valley
of
keow
terminated
by
the
perspective
of
the
cabins
of
jore
which
seemed
to
be
suspended
from
the
forehead
of
the
mountain
of
the
same
name
the
river
which
carried
us
along
flowed
between
high
cliffs
at
the
extremity
of
which
we
perceived
the
setting
sun
the
profound
solitudes
were
not
disturbed
by
the
presence
of
men
we
only
saw
one
indian
hunter
who
leaning
motionless
upon
his
bow
on
the
peak
of
a
rock
looked
like
a
statue
raised
upon
the
mountain
to
the
genius
of
those
deserts
atala
and
myself
added
our
silence
to
the
silence
of
this
scene
all
of
a
sudden
the
daughter
of
exile
filled
the
air
by
thus
singing
in
a
voice
replete
with
melancholy
emotion
of
her
absent
country
happy
are
they
who
have
not
seen
the
smoke
of
foreign
festivals
and
who
have
never
been
seated
elsewhere
than
at
the
rejoicings
of
their
fathers
if
the
blue
jackdaw
of
the
mississippi
were
to
say
to
the
nonpareil
of
the
floridas
why
dost
thou
complain
so
sadly
hast
thou
not
here
beautiful
waters
and
lovely
shades
and
all
sorts
of
pastures
as
in
thine
own
forests
yes
would
reply
the
fugitive
nonpareil
but
my
nest
is
in
the
jessamine
who
will
bring
it
to
me
and
the
sun
of
my
savannah
where
is
it
happy
are
they
who
have
not
seen
the
smoke
of
foreign
festivals
and
who
have
never
been
seated
elsewhere
than
at
the
rejoicings
of
their
fathers
after
hours
of
painful
wayfare
the
traveller
sits
down
in
sadness
he
sees
around
him
the
roofs
of
men
s
habitations
but
has
no
place
wherein
to
repose
his
head
the
traveller
knocks
at
a
cabin
places
his
bow
behind
the
door
and
asks
for
hospitality
the
master
makes
a
gesture
of
the
hand
the
traveller
takes
back
his
bow
and
returns
to
the
desert
happy
are
they
who
have
not
seen
the
smoke
of
foreign
festivals
and
who
have
never
been
seated
elsewhere
than
at
the
rejoicings
of
their
fathers
wondrous
stories
told
around
the
hearth
tender
effusions
of
the
heart
long
habits
of
loving
so
necessary
to
life
you
have
filled
the
days
of
those
who
have
not
quitted
their
natal
place
their
tombs
are
in
the
land
of
their
birth
with
the
setting
sun
the
tears
of
their
friends
and
the
charms
of
religion
happy
are
they
who
have
not
seen
the
smoke
of
foreign
festivals
and
who
have
never
been
seated
elsewhere
than
at
the
rejoicings
of
their
fathers
thus
sang
atala
nothing
interrupted
the
course
of
her
lamentations
except
the
almost
imperceptible
sound
of
our
boat
upon
the
waves
in
two
or
three
places
only
were
they
taken
up
by
a
weak
echo
which
repeated
them
to
a
second
and
the
second
to
a
third
faintly
and
more
faintly
still
it
seemed
as
though
the
souls
of
two
lovers
formerly
unfortunate
like
ourselves
and
attracted
by
the
touching
melody
were
enjoying
the
pleasure
of
sighing
forth
the
dying
sounds
of
its
music
in
the
mountain
nevertheless
the
solitude
the
constant
presence
of
the
beloved
object
even
our
misfortunes
increased
our
affection
from
one
instant
to
another
atala
prayed
continuously
to
her
mother
whose
irritated
shade
she
seemed
as
though
wishing
to
appease
she
sometimes
asked
me
if
i
did
not
hear
a
plaintive
voice
and
see
flames
issuing
out
of
the
earth
as
for
myself
exhausted
with
fatigue
but
still
burning
with
desire
and
thinking
that
i
was
perhaps
irretrievably
lost
in
the
midst
of
those
forests
i
was
a
hundred
times
upon
the
point
of
drawing
my
spouse
to
my
arms
and
a
hundred
times
did
i
urge
atala
to
allow
me
to
build
a
hut
upon
the
river
side
so
that
we
might
bury
ourselves
therein
together
but
she
always
resisted
my
propositions
remember
my
young
friend
she
would
say
that
a
warrior
owes
himself
to
his
country
what
is
a
woman
compared
to
the
duties
you
have
to
fulfil
take
courage
son
of
outalissi
do
not
murmur
against
your
destiny
the
heart
of
man
is
like
a
that
imbibes
pure
water
during
calm
weather
and
is
swollen
with
muddy
liquid
when
the
sky
has
troubled
the
waves
has
the
sponge
the
right
to
say
i
thought
there
would
never
be
any
storms
and
that
the
sun
would
never
be
scorching
o
rené
if
you
fear
the
trials
of
the
heart
be
upon
your
guard
against
solitude
the
great
passions
are
solitary
and
to
transport
them
to
the
desert
is
to
restore
them
to
their
triumph
overcome
with
cares
and
fears
exposed
to
the
danger
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
indian
enemies
to
be
swallowed
up
by
the
waters
stung
by
serpents
devoured
by
beasts
finding
the
poorest
nourishment
with
difficulty
and
not
knowing
whither
to
direct
our
steps
it
seemed
impossible
for
our
misfortunes
to
be
greater
when
an
accident
brought
them
to
a
climax
it
was
the
sun
since
our
departure
from
the
cabins
the
moon
of
fire
had
commenced
her
course
and
everything
announced
a
storm
towards
the
hour
when
the
indian
matrons
hang
up
the
to
the
branches
of
the
and
when
the
paroquets
retire
into
the
hollows
of
the
cypress
the
sky
began
to
be
overcast
the
voices
of
the
solitude
died
away
the
desert
became
silent
and
the
forests
were
reposing
in
the
midst
of
a
universal
calm
shortly
after
the
rollings
of
a
distant
thunder
prolonged
through
the
woods
as
old
as
the
world
from
them
with
sublime
sounds
fearful
of
being
submerged
we
hastened
to
reach
the
bank
of
the
river
and
withdrew
into
a
forest
the
month
of
july
the
ground
in
this
place
was
marshy
we
advanced
with
difficulty
under
a
vault
of
smilax
amidst
vines
and
creeping
ivy
that
entangled
our
feet
like
nets
the
spongy
soil
trembled
around
us
and
at
each
instant
we
were
on
the
point
of
sinking
into
the
quagmires
insects
without
number
and
enormous
bats
blinded
us
were
hissing
in
every
direction
and
wolves
bears
carcajous
and
young
tigers
come
to
hide
themselves
in
these
retreats
made
them
resound
with
their
roarings
meanwhile
the
darkness
increased
the
lowering
clouds
were
entering
beneath
the
leafy
covering
of
the
woods
suddenly
the
sky
was
rent
and
the
lightning
traced
a
rapid
of
fire
a
violent
wind
from
the
west
rolled
clouds
upon
clouds
the
forests
bent
the
sky
opened
time
after
time
and
from
between
the
interstices
other
skies
and
ardent
scenes
might
be
perceived
what
a
frightful
what
a
magnificent
spectacle
the
lightning
set
fire
to
the
forest
the
conflagration
extended
like
a
of
flame
columns
of
sparks
and
of
smoke
besieged
the
clouds
which
were
vomiting
their
flashes
into
the
vast
burning
mass
then
the
great
spirit
covered
the
mountain
with
heavy
darkness
and
from
the
midst
of
this
chaos
there
arose
a
confused
moaning
formed
by
the
rushing
of
the
winds
the
cracking
of
trees
the
howling
of
wild
beasts
the
buzzing
of
the
inflamed
vegetation
and
the
repeated
fall
of
thunderbolts
hissing
as
they
died
out
in
the
waters
the
great
spirit
knows
that
at
this
moment
i
saw
and
thought
of
nothing
but
atala
i
managed
to
guard
her
against
the
torrents
of
rain
by
placing
her
beneath
the
inclining
trunk
of
a
under
which
i
sat
down
holding
my
upon
my
knees
and
warming
her
naked
feet
between
my
hands
and
thus
i
found
myself
happier
than
the
young
spouse
who
feels
her
future
offspring
quiver
in
her
bosom
for
the
first
time
illustration
we
were
listening
to
the
sound
of
the
tempest
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
felt
one
of
atala
s
tears
fall
upon
my
breast
storm
of
the
heart
i
cried
to
myself
is
it
a
drop
of
your
rain
then
embracing
her
i
loved
i
said
atala
you
are
concealing
something
from
me
open
your
heart
to
me
o
beauty
it
does
one
so
much
good
when
a
friend
looks
into
one
s
soul
tell
me
this
secret
of
grief
which
you
persist
in
hiding
from
me
ah
i
see
you
are
weeping
for
your
she
immediately
retorted
child
of
men
why
should
i
weep
for
my
country
since
my
father
came
not
from
the
land
of
palms
what
i
replied
with
profound
astonishment
your
father
was
not
from
the
land
of
palms
what
was
he
then
who
brought
you
upon
this
earth
reply
atala
answered
in
these
words
before
my
mother
brought
to
the
warrior
simaghan
as
a
marriage
portion
thirty
mares
twenty
buffaloes
a
hundred
measures
of
fifty
and
a
quantity
of
other
riches
she
had
known
a
man
of
white
flesh
now
the
mother
of
my
mother
threw
water
in
her
face
and
forced
her
to
marry
the
magnanimous
simaghan
who
was
like
unto
a
king
and
honored
by
the
people
as
a
genius
but
my
mother
said
to
her
new
spouse
my
bosom
has
conceived
kill
simaghan
replied
to
her
may
the
great
spirit
preserve
me
from
such
an
action
i
will
not
mutilate
you
i
will
neither
cut
off
your
nose
nor
your
ears
because
you
have
been
sincere
and
have
not
betrayed
my
couch
the
fruit
of
your
bosom
shall
be
my
fruit
and
i
will
not
visit
you
till
after
the
departure
of
the
bird
of
the
when
the
thirteenth
moon
shall
have
about
that
time
i
issued
from
my
mother
s
bosom
and
i
began
to
grow
proud
as
a
spaniard
and
as
a
savage
my
mother
made
me
a
christian
so
that
her
god
and
the
god
of
my
father
might
also
be
my
god
afterwards
fell
upon
her
and
she
went
down
into
the
little
pit
furnished
with
skins
from
which
no
one
ever
comes
such
was
atala
s
story
and
who
was
your
father
then
poor
orphan
i
said
to
her
how
was
he
called
by
men
upon
earth
and
what
name
did
he
bear
among
the
genii
i
never
washed
my
father
s
feet
said
atala
i
only
know
that
he
lived
with
his
sister
at
saint
augustine
and
that
he
ever
remained
faithful
to
my
mother
philip
was
his
name
amongst
the
angels
and
men
called
him
at
these
words
i
uttered
a
cry
which
throughout
the
solitude
the
soumis
of
my
transports
mingled
with
those
of
the
storm
pressing
atala
to
my
heart
i
exclaimed
with
sobs
o
my
sister
o
daughter
of
lopez
daughter
of
my
benefactor
atala
alarmed
sought
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
my
agitation
but
when
she
learnt
that
lopez
was
the
generous
host
who
had
adopted
me
at
saint
augustine
and
whom
i
had
quitted
in
order
to
be
free
she
was
herself
stricken
with
joy
and
confusion
this
fraternal
friendship
which
came
upon
us
and
joined
its
love
to
our
love
was
too
much
for
our
hearts
already
had
i
intoxicated
myself
with
her
breath
already
had
i
drunk
all
the
magic
of
love
upon
her
lips
with
my
eyes
raised
towards
heaven
amidst
the
flash
of
the
lightnings
i
held
my
spouse
in
my
arms
in
the
presence
of
the
eternal
splendid
pomp
worthy
of
our
misfortunes
and
of
the
grandeur
of
our
loves
superb
forests
that
shook
your
creeping
plants
and
your
leafy
domes
as
though
they
were
to
be
the
curtains
and
the
canopy
of
our
couch
overflowing
river
roaring
mountains
frightful
and
sublime
nature
were
you
then
but
a
combination
prepared
to
deceive
us
and
could
you
not
for
one
moment
conceal
a
man
s
felicity
amidst
your
mysterious
horrors
suddenly
a
vivid
flash
followed
by
a
clap
of
thunder
ran
through
the
thickness
of
the
shades
filled
the
forest
with
sulphur
and
light
and
rent
a
tree
close
by
us
we
fled
o
surprise
in
the
silence
which
followed
we
heard
the
sound
of
a
bell
both
speechless
we
listened
to
the
sound
so
strange
in
a
desert
at
the
same
instant
a
dog
barked
in
the
distance
it
approached
redoubled
its
cries
came
up
to
us
and
howled
with
joy
at
our
feet
an
old
hermit
carrying
a
small
lantern
was
following
the
animal
through
the
darkness
of
the
forest
heaven
be
praised
he
cried
as
soon
as
he
perceived
us
i
have
been
looking
for
you
a
long
time
our
dog
smelt
you
as
soon
as
the
storm
commenced
and
has
guided
me
hither
poor
children
how
young
you
are
and
how
you
must
have
suffered
come
i
have
brought
a
it
shall
be
for
this
young
woman
and
there
is
some
wine
in
our
gourd
let
god
be
praised
in
all
his
works
his
mercy
is
great
and
his
goodness
is
infinite
atala
threw
herself
at
the
feet
of
the
monk
chief
of
prayer
said
she
to
him
i
am
a
christian
heaven
has
sent
you
to
save
me
my
daughter
said
the
hermit
raising
her
up
we
usually
ring
the
during
the
night
and
during
tempests
to
call
strangers
and
in
imitation
of
the
example
of
our
brethren
of
the
alps
and
of
the
liban
we
have
taught
our
dog
to
discover
lost
i
scarcely
understood
the
hermit
this
charity
appeared
to
me
so
much
above
man
that
i
thought
i
was
dreaming
by
the
light
of
the
little
lantern
the
monk
was
holding
in
his
hand
i
saw
that
his
beard
and
hair
were
saturated
with
water
his
feet
his
hands
and
his
face
were
bleeding
from
their
encounters
with
the
brambles
old
man
i
at
length
cried
what
sort
of
heart
have
you
that
you
did
not
fear
being
struck
by
the
lightning
fear
retorted
the
father
with
a
certain
ardor
fear
when
men
are
in
danger
and
i
can
be
useful
to
them
i
should
in
that
case
be
an
unworthy
servant
of
jesus
christ
but
do
you
know
i
interrupted
that
i
am
not
a
christian
young
man
replied
the
hermit
did
i
ask
you
your
religion
jesus
christ
did
not
say
my
blood
shall
wash
this
one
or
that
he
died
for
the
jew
and
for
the
gentile
and
he
only
considered
all
the
races
of
men
as
brothers
in
misfortune
what
i
am
now
doing
for
you
is
but
little
and
you
would
find
elsewhere
plenty
of
other
help
but
the
glory
of
it
should
not
fall
upon
the
priests
what
are
we
poor
hermits
if
not
the
coarse
instruments
of
a
celestial
work
and
what
soldier
would
be
cowardly
enough
to
retreat
when
his
chief
with
the
cross
in
his
hand
and
his
forehead
covered
with
thorns
marches
before
him
to
the
assistance
of
suffering
humanity
these
words
went
to
my
heart
tears
of
admiration
and
tenderness
fell
from
my
eyes
my
dear
children
said
the
missionary
i
govern
in
these
forests
a
little
flock
of
your
wild
brethren
my
grotto
is
not
far
from
here
in
the
mountain
come
and
warm
yourselves
under
my
roof
you
will
not
find
the
conveniences
of
life
there
but
you
shall
have
shelter
and
you
should
thank
the
divine
goodness
even
for
that
for
there
are
many
men
who
are
without
illustration
illustration
illustration
ii
the
laborers
there
are
some
righteous
people
whose
conscience
is
so
tranquil
that
one
can
not
approach
them
without
participating
in
the
peace
emitted
so
to
say
by
their
heart
and
by
their
language
as
the
hermit
went
on
speaking
i
felt
the
passions
calm
down
in
my
bosom
and
even
the
storm
of
heaven
appeared
to
recede
at
his
voice
the
clouds
were
soon
sufficiently
dispersed
to
permit
us
to
quit
our
retreat
we
issued
from
the
forest
and
commenced
climbing
a
high
mountain
the
dog
walked
by
our
side
carrying
the
extinguished
lantern
at
the
end
of
a
stick
i
held
atala
by
the
hand
and
we
followed
the
missionary
he
frequently
turned
round
to
look
at
us
and
seemed
to
pity
our
youth
and
our
misfortunes
a
book
was
hanging
from
his
neck
and
he
leant
upon
a
white
staff
his
figure
was
tall
his
face
pale
and
thin
and
his
countenance
simple
and
sincere
his
features
showed
that
he
had
seen
bad
days
and
the
deep
wrinkles
in
his
forehead
were
the
noble
scars
of
passions
overcome
by
virtue
and
by
the
love
of
god
and
of
man
when
he
spoke
to
us
standing
and
motionless
his
long
beard
his
eyes
modestly
cast
downwards
the
affectionate
tone
of
his
voice
everything
about
him
was
calm
and
sublime
whoever
like
myself
has
seen
father
aubry
with
his
breviary
and
staff
on
his
lonely
way
in
the
desert
preserves
a
veritable
idea
of
the
christian
traveller
upon
earth
after
half
an
hour
s
dangerous
march
through
the
paths
of
the
mountain
we
arrived
at
the
missionary
s
grotto
we
entered
it
over
an
accumulation
of
wet
ivy
and
wild
plants
washed
down
from
the
rocks
by
the
rain
there
was
nothing
in
the
place
beyond
a
mat
of
a
gourd
for
drawing
up
water
a
few
wooden
vessels
a
spade
a
harmless
serpent
and
upon
a
block
of
stone
that
served
as
a
table
a
crucifix
and
the
book
of
the
christians
the
man
of
ancient
days
was
not
long
in
lighting
a
fire
with
some
dried
leaves
he
then
crushed
some
indian
corn
between
two
stones
and
having
made
a
cake
with
it
placed
it
beneath
the
ashes
to
bake
when
the
cake
had
come
to
a
fine
golden
color
he
served
it
to
us
hot
with
in
a
maple
bowl
the
evening
having
restored
calm
the
servant
of
the
great
spirit
proposed
that
we
should
go
and
sit
at
the
entrance
to
the
grotto
which
commanded
an
immense
view
the
remains
of
the
storm
had
been
carried
in
disorder
towards
the
east
the
fires
of
the
conflagration
caused
in
the
forests
by
the
lightning
were
still
shining
in
the
distance
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
an
entire
had
been
thrown
down
into
the
mud
and
the
river
was
charged
with
molten
clay
trunks
of
trees
and
the
bodies
of
dead
animals
and
of
dead
fishes
floating
upon
the
still
agitated
surface
of
the
waters
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
scene
that
atala
related
our
history
to
the
old
genius
of
the
mountain
his
heart
appeared
to
be
touched
and
tears
fell
upon
his
beard
my
child
he
said
to
atala
you
must
offer
your
sufferings
to
god
for
whose
glory
you
have
already
done
so
many
things
he
will
give
you
rest
look
at
those
smoking
forests
those
receding
torrents
those
scattered
clouds
do
you
imagine
that
he
who
can
calm
such
a
tempest
can
not
appease
the
troubles
of
the
heart
of
man
if
you
have
no
better
retreat
my
dear
daughter
i
offer
you
a
place
amongst
the
flock
i
have
had
the
happiness
of
calling
to
jesus
christ
i
will
instruct
chactas
and
i
will
give
him
to
you
as
a
husband
when
he
shall
have
proved
himself
worthy
to
be
your
at
these
words
i
fell
at
the
hermit
s
knees
shedding
tears
of
joy
but
atala
became
as
pale
as
death
the
old
man
raised
me
with
benignity
and
i
then
perceived
that
both
his
hands
were
mutilated
atala
at
once
comprehended
his
misfortunes
the
barbarians
she
exclaimed
my
daughter
replied
the
hermit
with
a
pleasant
smile
what
is
that
in
comparison
with
the
sufferings
of
my
divine
master
if
the
indian
idolators
have
tortured
me
they
are
poor
blind
creatures
whom
god
will
enlighten
some
day
i
love
them
all
the
more
for
the
injury
they
have
done
me
i
could
not
remain
in
my
country
to
which
i
had
gone
back
and
where
an
illustrious
queen
did
me
the
honor
to
look
upon
these
poor
marks
of
my
apostolate
and
what
more
glorious
reward
could
i
receive
for
my
labors
than
that
of
obtaining
from
the
head
of
our
religion
the
permission
to
celebrate
the
divine
sacrifice
with
these
mutilated
hands
it
only
remained
for
me
after
such
an
honor
to
try
and
render
myself
worthy
of
it
so
i
returned
to
the
new
world
to
pass
the
rest
of
my
lift
in
the
service
of
my
god
i
have
dwelt
in
these
solitudes
nearly
thirty
years
and
it
will
be
since
i
took
possession
of
this
rock
when
i
came
to
the
place
i
encountered
but
a
few
wandering
families
whose
manners
were
ferocious
and
whose
life
was
miserable
i
have
induced
them
to
listen
to
the
word
of
peace
and
their
manners
have
become
gradually
softened
they
now
live
together
at
the
foot
of
this
mountain
whilst
teaching
them
the
way
of
salvation
i
endeavored
to
instruct
them
in
the
primary
arts
of
life
but
without
carrying
them
too
far
and
constantly
keeping
the
honest
people
within
the
bounds
of
that
simplicity
which
constitutes
happiness
fearing
to
trouble
them
by
my
presence
i
retired
to
this
grotto
where
they
come
to
consult
me
it
is
here
that
far
from
man
i
admire
god
in
the
grandeur
of
the
solitude
and
prepare
myself
for
the
death
which
the
length
of
my
years
announces
to
me
as
illustration
on
finishing
this
discourse
the
hermit
fell
upon
his
knees
and
we
imitated
his
example
he
began
in
a
loud
voice
a
prayer
to
which
atala
responded
some
dull
flashes
of
lightning
still
opened
the
sky
in
the
east
and
upon
the
western
clouds
three
suns
seemed
to
be
shining
at
the
same
time
we
the
grotto
where
the
hermit
stretched
out
a
bed
of
for
atala
profound
language
was
depicted
in
the
eyes
and
movements
of
the
maiden
she
looked
at
father
aubry
as
though
she
wished
to
reveal
a
secret
to
him
but
something
appeared
to
deter
her
from
so
doing
either
my
presence
or
a
sort
of
shame
or
perhaps
the
uselessness
of
the
avowal
i
heard
her
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
went
to
look
for
the
hermit
but
as
he
had
given
up
his
couch
to
atala
he
had
gone
to
contemplate
the
beauty
of
the
heavens
and
to
pray
to
god
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
he
told
me
the
next
day
that
such
was
his
custom
even
during
winter
as
he
loved
to
see
the
forests
wave
their
stripped
summits
the
clouds
fly
through
the
air
and
to
hear
the
winds
and
the
torrents
roar
in
the
solitude
my
sister
was
therefore
obliged
to
return
to
her
couch
where
she
immediately
fell
asleep
alas
full
of
hope
i
thought
atala
s
weakness
was
nothing
more
than
a
passing
sign
of
weariness
the
following
morning
i
was
awakened
by
the
songs
of
the
cardinals
and
the
mockingbirds
nestled
in
the
acacias
and
laurels
that
surrounded
the
grotto
i
went
forth
and
gathered
a
magnolia
rose
and
placed
it
wet
with
the
tears
of
the
morning
upon
the
head
of
my
sleeping
atala
i
hoped
according
to
the
religion
of
my
country
that
the
soul
of
some
child
dead
at
the
breast
might
have
descended
upon
this
flower
in
a
and
that
a
happy
dream
might
convey
it
to
the
bosom
of
my
future
spouse
i
afterwards
sought
my
host
i
found
him
his
gown
turned
up
into
his
two
pockets
and
a
chaplet
in
his
hand
waiting
for
me
seated
upon
the
trunk
of
a
that
had
fallen
from
old
age
he
proposed
that
we
should
go
together
to
the
mission
while
atala
was
still
reposing
i
accepted
his
offer
and
we
immediately
started
on
our
way
on
descending
the
mountain
i
perceived
some
oaks
upon
which
the
genii
seemed
to
have
drawn
foreign
characters
the
hermit
told
me
that
he
had
traced
them
himself
that
they
were
some
verses
of
an
ancient
poet
called
homer
and
a
few
sentences
of
another
poet
more
ancient
still
named
solomon
there
was
a
sort
of
mysterious
harmony
between
the
wisdom
of
former
times
the
verses
eaten
into
by
moss
the
old
hermit
who
had
engraved
them
and
the
aged
oaks
which
had
served
him
for
books
his
name
his
age
and
the
date
of
his
mission
were
also
marked
upon
a
reed
of
the
savannah
at
the
foot
of
those
trees
i
was
surprised
at
the
fragility
of
the
latter
monument
it
will
last
longer
than
i
replied
the
father
and
it
will
always
be
of
more
value
than
the
little
good
i
have
from
thence
we
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
a
valley
where
i
saw
a
wonderful
work
it
was
a
natural
bridge
similar
to
that
in
virginia
of
which
you
have
perhaps
heard
men
my
son
especially
those
of
your
country
often
imitate
nature
and
their
copies
are
always
insignificant
it
is
not
the
same
with
nature
when
she
appears
to
imitate
the
labors
of
men
by
in
reality
offering
them
models
then
it
is
that
she
throws
bridges
from
the
summit
of
one
mountain
to
the
summit
of
another
suspends
roads
in
the
air
spreads
rivers
for
canals
carves
out
hills
for
columns
and
for
basins
excavates
seas
we
passed
beneath
the
sole
arch
of
this
bridge
and
found
ourselves
in
front
of
another
wonder
the
cemetery
of
the
indians
of
the
mission
or
the
groves
of
death
father
aubry
had
permitted
his
neophytes
to
bury
their
dead
in
their
manner
and
to
continue
its
original
name
to
their
place
of
sepulture
he
had
merely
sanctified
the
place
with
a
cross
the
soil
was
divided
like
fields
set
out
for
harvest
into
as
many
lots
as
there
were
families
each
lot
formed
a
wood
of
itself
which
varied
according
to
the
taste
of
those
who
had
planted
it
a
stream
meandered
noiselessly
through
the
groves
it
went
by
the
name
of
the
river
of
peace
this
smiling
refuge
of
souls
was
closed
on
the
east
by
the
bridge
beneath
which
we
had
passed
two
hills
bounded
it
on
the
north
and
on
the
south
and
it
was
open
only
towards
the
west
where
stood
a
large
forest
of
fir
trees
the
trunks
of
these
trees
spotted
with
green
and
growing
without
branches
up
to
their
very
summits
resembled
tall
columns
and
formed
the
peristyle
of
this
temple
of
death
we
remarked
a
religious
sound
similar
to
the
murmurs
of
an
organ
beneath
the
roof
of
a
church
but
when
we
had
penetrated
into
the
interior
of
the
sanctuary
we
could
hear
nothing
beyond
the
hymns
of
the
birds
celebrating
an
eternal
fête
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
on
emerging
from
the
wood
we
perceived
the
village
of
the
mission
situated
on
the
side
of
a
lake
in
the
midst
of
a
savannah
planted
with
flowers
it
was
reached
by
an
avenue
of
magnolias
and
oaks
which
bordered
one
of
those
ancient
roads
met
with
towards
the
mountains
that
separate
kentucky
from
the
floridas
as
soon
as
the
indians
saw
their
pastor
in
the
plain
they
abandoned
their
labors
and
hastened
to
meet
him
some
of
them
kissed
his
gown
others
assisted
him
to
walk
the
mothers
raised
their
little
children
in
their
arms
to
show
them
the
man
of
jesus
christ
who
had
shed
tears
father
aubry
inquired
as
he
went
along
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
village
he
gave
counsel
to
one
and
a
mild
reprimand
to
another
he
spoke
of
harvests
to
be
gathered
of
children
to
be
instructed
of
troubles
to
be
consoled
and
he
alluded
to
god
in
every
topic
he
touched
upon
thus
escorted
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
large
cross
placed
by
the
roadside
it
was
here
that
the
servant
of
god
was
in
the
habit
of
celebrating
the
mysteries
of
his
religion
my
dear
neophytes
said
he
turning
himself
towards
the
crowd
a
brother
and
a
sister
have
come
up
to
you
and
as
an
additional
happiness
i
see
that
providence
spared
your
harvests
yesterday
behold
two
great
reasons
for
thankfulness
let
us
therefore
offer
up
the
holy
sacrifice
and
may
each
of
you
bring
to
it
deep
attention
a
lively
faith
infinite
gratitude
and
a
humble
heart
father
aubry
had
done
like
the
jesuits
in
china
who
allowed
the
chinese
to
inter
their
relations
in
their
gardens
according
to
an
ancient
custom
the
holy
priest
forthwith
put
on
a
white
tunic
of
the
sacred
cups
were
withdrawn
from
a
tabernacle
at
the
foot
of
the
cross
the
altar
was
set
out
on
a
portion
of
the
rock
water
was
procured
from
the
neighboring
torrent
and
a
bunch
of
wild
grapes
furnished
the
wine
for
the
sacrifice
we
all
went
down
upon
our
knees
in
the
high
grass
and
the
mystery
began
break
of
day
appearing
from
behind
the
mountains
inflamed
the
eastern
sky
everything
in
the
solitude
was
golden
or
roseate
the
sun
announced
by
so
much
splendor
at
length
issued
from
an
abyss
of
light
and
its
first
ray
fell
upon
the
consecrated
host
which
the
priest
was
at
that
very
moment
raising
in
the
air
after
the
sacrifice
during
which
nothing
was
wanting
to
me
but
the
daughter
of
lopez
we
went
to
the
village
the
most
touching
mixture
of
social
and
natural
life
reigned
there
by
the
side
of
a
of
the
ancient
desert
was
a
nascent
vegetation
ears
of
corn
rolled
like
gold
about
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
oak
and
summer
sheaves
replaced
the
tree
of
three
centuries
on
all
sides
forests
given
up
to
the
flames
were
sending
up
their
smoke
into
the
air
and
the
plough
was
being
pushed
slowly
through
the
remains
of
their
roots
surveyors
with
long
chains
went
to
measure
the
ground
arbitrators
marked
out
the
first
properties
the
bird
gave
up
its
nest
the
den
of
the
wild
beast
was
converted
into
a
cabin
forges
were
heard
to
roar
and
the
blows
of
the
axe
caused
the
echoes
to
resound
for
the
last
time
as
they
expired
with
the
trees
which
had
served
them
for
a
refuse
i
wandered
with
delight
in
the
midst
of
these
scenes
rendered
still
more
enchanting
by
the
image
of
atala
and
by
the
dreams
of
felicity
with
which
i
was
feeding
my
heart
i
admired
the
triumph
of
christianity
over
savage
life
i
saw
the
indian
becoming
civilized
by
the
voice
of
religion
i
assisted
at
the
primitive
union
of
man
and
the
earth
man
by
this
great
contract
abandoning
to
the
earth
the
inheritance
of
his
labors
and
the
earth
undertaking
in
return
to
bear
faithfully
the
harvests
the
sons
and
the
ashes
of
man
during
this
time
a
child
was
presented
to
the
missionary
who
baptized
it
among
the
flowering
jessamine
on
the
border
of
a
spring
whilst
a
coffin
in
the
midst
of
these
joys
and
labors
was
being
carried
to
the
groves
of
death
two
spouses
received
the
nuptial
benediction
beneath
an
oak
and
we
afterwards
went
to
install
them
in
a
corner
of
the
desert
the
pastor
walked
in
front
of
us
blessing
here
and
there
a
rock
a
tree
or
a
fountain
as
of
old
according
to
the
book
of
the
christians
god
blessed
the
untilled
land
when
he
gave
it
to
adam
for
an
inheritance
this
procession
which
with
the
flocks
was
following
its
venerable
chief
from
rock
to
rock
represented
to
my
affected
heart
the
migrations
of
the
first
families
when
shem
with
his
children
advanced
into
an
unknown
world
following
the
sun
as
his
guide
i
desired
to
know
from
the
hermit
how
he
governed
his
flock
with
great
patience
he
replied
to
me
i
have
laid
down
no
law
for
them
i
have
merely
taught
them
to
love
one
another
to
pray
to
god
and
to
hope
for
a
better
life
all
the
laws
in
the
world
are
comprised
therein
towards
the
middle
of
the
village
you
may
perceive
a
cabin
somewhat
larger
than
the
rest
it
serves
as
a
chapel
during
the
rainy
season
my
children
assemble
there
morning
and
evening
to
praise
the
lord
and
when
i
am
absent
an
old
man
offers
up
the
prayers
for
old
age
like
maternity
is
a
sort
of
priesthood
the
people
afterwards
go
to
work
in
the
fields
and
although
the
properties
are
divided
in
order
that
each
may
learn
something
of
social
economy
the
harvests
are
deposited
in
the
same
storehouse
out
of
a
spirit
of
brotherly
charity
four
old
men
are
charged
with
the
equal
distribution
of
the
produce
of
the
general
labors
add
to
all
that
our
religious
ceremonies
plenty
of
hymns
the
cross
where
i
celebrate
the
mysteries
the
beneath
which
i
preach
in
fine
weather
our
tombs
near
our
our
rivers
into
which
i
plunge
the
little
children
and
the
saint
johns
of
this
new
bethany
and
you
will
have
a
complete
idea
of
this
kingdom
of
jesus
the
language
of
the
hermit
delighted
me
and
i
felt
the
superiority
of
this
stable
and
busy
life
over
the
wandering
and
idle
existence
of
the
savage
ah
rené
i
do
not
repine
against
providence
yet
i
confess
i
never
think
of
that
evangelical
society
without
experiencing
bitter
regret
how
a
hut
with
atala
in
that
neighborhood
would
have
rendered
my
life
happy
there
all
my
wanderings
would
have
ceased
there
with
a
spouse
ignored
by
men
and
concealing
my
happiness
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
my
days
would
have
flown
by
like
those
rivers
which
have
not
even
a
name
in
the
desert
instead
of
the
peace
i
was
then
bold
enough
to
promise
myself
amidst
what
troubles
have
my
years
been
cast
the
constant
plaything
of
fortune
wrecked
upon
every
shore
long
an
exile
from
my
country
and
on
my
return
thither
finding
only
a
ruined
cabin
and
friends
in
the
tomb
such
was
to
be
the
destiny
of
chactas

iii
the
drama
if
my
dream
of
happiness
was
bright
it
was
also
of
short
duration
and
i
was
to
be
awakened
from
it
at
the
hermit
s
grotto
on
arriving
there
in
the
middle
of
the
clay
i
was
surprised
at
not
seeing
atala
come
forth
to
meet
us
i
can
not
tell
what
sudden
apprehension
took
possession
of
me
as
we
approached
the
grotto
i
dared
not
call
the
daughter
of
lopez
my
imagination
was
equally
frightened
by
the
idea
of
the
noise
or
of
the
silence
that
might
follow
my
cries
still
more
terrified
by
the
dark
appearance
of
the
entrance
to
the
rock
i
said
to
the
missionary
o
you
whom
heaven
accompanies
and
strengthens
penetrate
into
those
shades
how
weak
is
the
man
who
is
governed
by
his
passions
how
strong
is
he
who
relies
upon
god
there
was
more
courage
in
that
religious
heart
withered
by
years
than
in
all
the
ardor
of
my
youth
the
man
of
peace
entered
the
grotto
whilst
i
remained
outside
full
of
terror
soon
a
feeble
murmur
of
complaint
issued
from
the
interior
of
the
rock
and
fell
upon
my
ear
uttering
a
cry
as
i
recovered
my
strength
i
rushed
into
the
darkness
of
the
cavern
spirits
of
my
fathers
you
alone
know
the
spectacle
that
met
my
view
the
hermit
had
lighted
a
which
he
was
holding
with
a
trembling
hand
over
atala
s
couch
with
her
hair
in
disorder
the
young
and
beautiful
woman
slightly
raised
upon
her
elbow
looked
pale
and
suffering
drops
of
painful
sweat
shone
upon
her
forehead
her
eyes
still
sought
to
express
her
love
to
me
and
her
mouth
endeavored
to
smile
as
though
struck
by
lightning
with
my
eyes
fixed
my
arms
outstretched
and
my
lips
apart
i
remained
motionless
a
profound
silence
reigned
for
a
moment
between
the
three
personages
of
this
scene
of
grief
the
hermit
was
the
first
to
break
it
this
he
said
can
only
be
a
fever
occasioned
by
fatigue
and
if
we
resign
ourselves
to
god
s
will
he
will
take
pity
on
at
these
words
my
heart
revived
and
with
the
mobility
of
the
savage
i
passed
suddenly
from
an
excess
of
fear
to
an
excess
of
confidence
from
which
however
atala
soon
aroused
me
shaking
her
head
sadly
she
made
us
a
sign
to
approach
her
couch
my
father
she
said
in
a
weak
voice
addressing
herself
to
the
hermit
i
am
upon
the
point
of
death
o
chactas
listen
without
despair
to
the
fatal
secret
i
had
concealed
from
you
in
order
not
to
make
you
too
miserable
and
out
of
obedience
to
my
mother
try
not
to
interrupt
me
by
any
marks
of
grief
which
would
shorten
the
few
moments
i
have
to
live
i
have
many
things
to
tell
of
and
from
the
beatings
of
my
heart
which
slacken
i
do
not
know
what
icy
burden
presses
within
my
bosom
i
feel
that
i
can
not
make
too
much
haste
after
a
short
silence
atala
continued
thus
my
sad
destiny
began
almost
before
i
had
seen
the
light
my
mother
had
conceived
me
in
misfortune
i
wearied
her
bosom
and
she
brought
me
into
the
world
with
such
painful
difficulty
that
my
life
was
despaired
of
to
save
me
my
mother
made
a
vow
she
promised
the
queen
of
angels
that
i
should
consecrate
myself
to
an
unwedded
life
if
i
escaped
from
death
that
fatal
vow
is
now
hurrying
me
to
the
tomb
i
was
entering
upon
my
sixteenth
year
when
i
lost
my
mother
some
hours
before
her
death
she
called
me
to
her
bedside
my
daughter
she
said
in
the
presence
of
the
missionary
who
was
consoling
her
last
moments
you
know
the
vow
i
made
for
you
would
you
belie
your
mother
o
my
atala
i
am
leaving
you
in
a
world
that
is
not
worthy
of
possessing
a
christian
in
the
midst
of
idolators
who
persecute
the
god
of
your
father
and
of
your
mother
the
god
who
after
having
given
you
life
has
preserved
it
to
you
by
a
miracle
ah
my
dear
child
by
accepting
the
virgin
s
veil
you
only
renounce
the
cares
of
the
cabin
and
the
fatal
passions
which
have
tormented
your
mother
s
breast
come
then
my
come
swear
upon
this
image
of
the
saviour
s
mother
held
by
the
hands
of
this
holy
priest
and
of
your
dying
parent
that
you
will
not
betray
me
in
the
face
of
heaven
remember
what
i
promised
for
you
in
order
to
save
your
life
and
that
if
you
do
not
keep
my
promise
you
will
plunge
your
mother
s
soul
into
eternal
o
my
mother
why
spake
you
thus
o
religion
the
cause
of
my
ills
and
of
my
felicity
my
ruin
and
my
consolation
at
the
same
time
and
you
dear
and
sad
object
of
a
passion
that
is
consuming
me
even
in
the
arms
of
death
you
can
now
see
o
chactas
what
has
caused
the
hardship
of
our
destiny
melting
into
tears
and
throwing
myself
upon
my
mother
s
bosom
i
promised
all
that
i
was
asked
to
promise
the
missionary
pronounced
over
me
the
fearful
language
of
my
oath
and
gave
me
the
scapulary
that
bound
me
forever
my
mother
threatened
me
with
her
malediction
if
ever
i
broke
my
vow
and
after
having
advised
me
to
keep
the
secret
inviolably
from
the
pagans
the
persecutors
of
my
religion
she
expired
whilst
holding
me
in
a
tender
embrace
illustration

illustration

i
did
not
at
first
know
the
danger
of
my
oath
full
of
ardor
and
a
veritable
christian
proud
too
of
the
spanish
blood
that
flowed
in
my
veins
i
saw
myself
surrounded
by
men
unworthy
of
receiving
my
hand
and
i
congratulated
myself
upon
having
no
other
spouse
than
the
god
of
my
mother
i
saw
you
young
and
beautiful
prisoner
i
pitied
your
lot
i
had
the
courage
to
speak
to
you
at
the
funeral
pile
in
the
forest
then
it
was
that
i
felt
the
weight
of
my
vows
when
atala
had
finished
littering
these
words
i
cried
out
with
clenched
fists
and
looking
at
the
missionary
with
a
threatening
air
this
then
is
the
religion
you
have
so
much
vaunted
to
me
perish
the
oath
that
deprives
me
of
atala
why
did
you
come
into
these
forests
to
save
you
said
the
old
man
in
a
terrible
voice
to
conquer
your
passions
and
to
prevent
you
blasphemer
from
drawing
down
upon
yourself
the
wrath
of
heaven
it
is
becoming
indeed
for
so
young
a
man
scarcely
entered
upon
life
to
complain
of
his
griefs
where
are
the
marks
of
your
sufferings
where
are
the
acts
of
injustice
you
have
had
to
support
where
are
your
virtues
which
alone
could
give
you
a
certain
right
to
murmur
what
services
have
you
rendered
what
good
have
you
done
what
miserable
creature
you
can
only
show
me
passions
and
you
dare
to
accuse
heaven
when
like
father
aubry
you
shall
have
passed
thirty
years
in
exile
upon
the
mountains
you
will
be
less
prompt
to
judge
of
the
designs
of
providence
you
will
then
understand
that
you
know
nothing
and
are
nothing
and
that
there
is
no
chastisement
so
severe
no
misfortune
so
terrible
that
our
corrupt
flesh
does
not
deserve
to
the
lightnings
that
flashed
from
the
old
man
s
eyes
the
beatings
of
his
beard
against
his
breast
and
his
fiery
language
made
him
like
to
a
god
overcome
by
his
majesty
i
fell
at
the
father
s
knees
and
asked
pardon
for
my
anger
my
son
he
replied
in
a
tone
so
mild
that
a
feeling
of
remorse
entered
my
soul
it
was
not
for
myself
that
i
reprimanded
you
alas
you
are
right
my
dear
child
i
have
done
but
very
little
in
these
forests
and
god
has
no
servant
more
unworthy
than
myself
but
my
son
it
is
heaven
heaven
i
say
that
should
never
be
accused
pardon
me
if
i
have
offended
you
and
let
us
listen
to
your
sister
there
may
still
perhaps
be
some
remedy
do
not
let
us
tire
of
hoping
chactas
the
religion
which
has
made
a
virtue
of
hope
is
a
divine
religion
my
young
friend
resumed
atala
you
have
been
a
witness
of
my
struggles
and
nevertheless
you
have
seen
but
the
smallest
portion
of
them
i
concealed
the
rest
from
you
no
the
black
slave
who
moistens
the
hot
sands
of
the
floridas
with
his
sweat
is
less
miserable
than
atala
has
been
urging
you
to
flight
and
yet
certain
to
die
if
you
left
me
fearful
of
flying
with
you
to
the
desert
and
still
panting
after
the
shade
of
the
woods
ah
if
it
had
only
been
required
of
me
to
abandon
my
relations
my
friends
my
country
if
even
frightful
thought
i
should
only
have
incurred
the
loss
of
my
soul
but
thy
shadow
o
my
mother
thy
shadow
was
always
there
reminding
me
of
thy
tortures
i
heard
thy
complaints
i
saw
the
flames
of
hell
consuming
thee
my
nights
were
barren
and
haunted
by
phantoms
my
days
were
disconsolate
the
evening
dew
dried
as
it
fell
upon
my
burning
skin
i
opened
my
lips
to
the
breezes
and
the
breezes
far
from
refreshing
me
became
heated
with
the
fire
of
my
breath
what
torture
it
was
for
me
chactas
to
see
you
constantly
near
me
far
from
all
mankind
in
the
depths
of
the
solitude
and
to
feel
that
there
was
an
invincible
barrier
between
you
and
myself
to
have
passed
my
life
at
your
feet
to
have
waited
upon
you
like
a
slave
to
have
prepared
your
repasts
and
your
couch
in
some
unknown
corner
of
the
universe
would
have
been
for
me
supreme
happiness
that
happiness
was
within
my
reach
yet
i
could
not
enjoy
it
what
plans
i
have
imagined
what
dreams
have
passed
through
this
sad
heart
of
mine
occasionally
when
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
you
i
went
so
far
as
to
encourage
desires
that
were
as
foolish
as
they
were
culpable
sometimes
i
wished
i
were
the
only
creature
living
with
you
upon
the
earth
at
other
times
feeling
a
divinity
that
stopped
me
in
my
horrible
transports
i
seemed
to
desire
that
that
divinity
might
be
annihilated
provided
that
pressed
in
your
arms
i
might
roll
from
abyss
to
abyss
with
the
ruins
of
god
and
of
the
world
even
now
shall
i
say
it
now
that
eternity
is
about
to
swallow
me
up
that
i
am
going
to
appear
before
the
inexorable
judge
at
the
moment
when
from
obedience
to
my
mother
i
see
with
joy
my
vow
devouring
my
life
well
even
now
by
a
frightful
contradiction
i
carry
away
with
me
the
regret
of
not
having
been
yours
my
daughter
interrupted
the
missionary
your
grief
misleads
you
the
excess
of
passion
to
which
you
are
abandoning
yourself
is
rarely
just
it
is
not
even
natural
and
for
that
reason
it
is
less
culpable
in
the
eyes
of
god
because
it
is
rather
an
error
of
the
mind
than
a
vice
of
the
heart
you
must
therefore
put
away
such
passionate
feelings
which
are
unworthy
of
your
innocence
at
the
same
time
my
dear
child
your
impetuous
imagination
has
alarmed
you
too
much
concerning
your
vows
religion
requires
no
superhuman
sacrifice
its
true
sentiments
its
moderated
virtues
are
far
above
the
exalted
sentiments
and
the
forced
virtues
of
a
pretending
heroism
if
you
had
succumbed
well
poor
lost
sheep
the
good
shepherd
would
have
sought
for
you
and
would
have
brought
you
back
to
the
flock
the
treasures
of
repentance
were
open
to
you
torrents
of
blood
are
required
to
wipe
out
our
faults
in
the
eyes
of
men
a
single
tear
suffices
with
god
tranquilize
yourself
therefore
my
dear
daughter
your
situation
needs
calm
let
us
address
ourselves
to
god
who
heals
all
the
wounds
of
his
servants
if
it
be
his
will
as
i
trust
it
may
be
that
you
escape
from
this
malady
i
will
write
to
the
bishop
of
quebec
he
has
the
power
to
release
you
from
your
vows
which
are
but
simple
vows
and
you
shall
finish
your
days
near
me
with
chactas
as
your
as
the
old
man
finished
speaking
atala
was
seized
with
a
violent
convulsion
from
which
she
emerged
with
all
the
signs
of
fearful
suffering
what
said
she
joining
her
two
hands
with
passion
there
was
a
remedy
i
could
have
been
released
from
my
vows
yes
my
daughter
replied
the
father
and
it
is
still
it
is
too
late
it
is
too
late
she
cried
must
i
die
at
the
moment
when
i
learn
that
i
might
have
been
happy
why
did
i
not
know
this
old
man
sooner
at
present
what
happiness
should
i
be
enjoying
with
you
with
my
chactas
a
christian
consoled
comforted
by
this
august
priest
in
this
desert
for
ever
oh
my
felicity
would
have
been
too
great
calm
yourself
i
said
to
her
taking
hold
of
one
of
the
unfortunate
maiden
s
hands
calm
yourself
that
happiness
is
still
in
store
for
never
never
said
atala
how
i
asked
you
do
not
know
all
cried
the
maiden
yesterday
during
the
storm
i
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
my
vows
i
was
going
to
plunge
my
mother
into
the
flames
of
the
abyss
already
her
malediction
was
upon
me
already
i
lied
to
the
god
who
had
saved
my
life
whilst
you
were
kissing
my
trembling
lips
you
were
not
aware
that
you
were
embracing
death
o
heaven
cried
the
missionary
dear
child
what
have
you
done
a
crime
my
father
said
atala
with
her
eyes
wandering
but
i
only
destroyed
myself
and
i
saved
my
finish
then
i
exclaimed
full
of
fear
well
she
said
i
had
foreseen
my
weakness
and
on
quitting
the
cabins
i
took
away
with
me
what
i
interrupted
with
horror
a
poison
said
the
father
it
is
now
at
my
heart
cried
atala
the
torch
slipped
from
the
hermit
s
hand
i
fell
fainting
near
lopez
s
daughter
the
old
man
took
each
of
us
in
his
arms
and
during
a
short
interval
we
all
three
mingled
our
sobs
on
the
funeral
couch
let
us
be
stirring
let
us
be
stirring
said
the
courageous
father
as
he
rose
to
light
a
lamp
we
are
losing
precious
moments
like
intrepid
christians
let
us
brave
the
assaults
of
adversity
with
the
cord
about
our
necks
and
with
ashes
upon
our
heads
let
us
throw
ourselves
at
the
feet
of
the
most
high
to
implore
his
clemency
and
to
submit
ourselves
to
his
decrees
perhaps
it
may
still
be
time
my
daughter
you
ought
to
have
told
me
of
this
last
alas
my
father
said
atala
i
looked
for
you
last
night
but
heaven
as
a
punishment
for
my
faults
kept
you
away
from
me
besides
all
help
would
have
been
useless
for
even
the
indians
themselves
who
are
so
clever
in
what
concerns
poisons
know
no
remedy
for
that
i
have
taken
o
chactas
judge
of
my
astonishment
when
i
found
that
the
result
was
not
so
prompt
as
i
had
expected
my
love
redoubled
my
strength
and
my
soul
was
unwilling
to
separate
thus
quickly
from
you
it
was
no
longer
by
sobs
that
i
now
interrupted
atala
s
recital
but
by
a
torrent
of
passionate
transports
known
only
to
savages
i
rolled
myself
upon
the
ground
twisting
my
arms
and
biting
my
hands
the
old
priest
with
wonderful
tenderness
ran
from
brother
to
sister
endeavoring
to
relieve
us
in
a
thousand
ways
through
the
calmness
of
his
heartland
from
the
experience
due
to
his
weight
of
years
he
knew
how
to
act
upon
our
youth
and
his
religion
furnished
him
with
accents
even
more
tender
and
more
ardent
than
our
passions
does
not
this
priest
who
had
passed
forty
years
of
daily
sacrifice
in
the
service
of
god
and
man
upon
the
mountain
remind
you
of
the
holocausts
of
israel
smoking
perpetually
on
the
high
places
before
the
lord
alas
it
was
in
vain
that
he
tried
to
procure
a
remedy
for
atala
s
sufferings
fatigue
grief
poison
and
a
passion
more
mortal
than
all
the
poisons
together
had
united
to
snatch
the
flower
from
the
desert
towards
evening
terrible
symptoms
began
to
show
themselves
a
general
numbness
took
possession
of
atala
s
limbs
and
the
extremities
of
her
body
became
cold
touch
my
fingers
she
said
to
me
do
they
not
feel
quite
icy
i
could
not
reply
i
was
overcome
with
horror
afterwards
she
added
even
yesterday
my
your
contact
made
me
quiver
and
now
i
can
no
longer
feel
your
hand
i
scarcely
hear
your
voice
and
the
objects
in
the
grotto
are
disappearing
from
my
sight
one
after
the
other
are
not
the
birds
singing
the
sun
must
be
nearly
setting
chactas
its
rays
will
be
very
beautiful
in
the
desert
over
my
tomb
atala
perceiving
that
her
language
had
melted
us
into
tears
said
softly
pardon
me
my
kind
friends
i
am
very
weak
but
perhaps
i
shall
get
stronger
and
yet
to
die
so
young
all
at
once
when
my
heart
was
so
full
of
life
chief
of
prayer
take
pity
on
me
support
me
do
you
think
my
mother
will
be
satisfied
and
that
god
will
forgive
what
i
have
done
my
daughter
replied
the
holy
man
shedding
tears
and
wiping
them
away
with
his
trembling
mutilated
fingers
all
your
misfortunes
are
the
result
of
your
ignorance
your
savage
education
and
the
want
of
instruction
have
been
your
ruin
you
did
not
know
that
a
christian
can
not
dispose
of
his
life
console
yourself
therefore
my
dear
lamb
god
will
pardon
you
on
account
of
the
simplicity
of
your
heart
your
mother
and
the
imprudent
missionary
who
guided
her
are
more
to
be
blamed
than
you
they
exceeded
their
power
in
imposing
an
indiscreet
vow
upon
you
but
may
the
lord
be
with
them
you
all
three
offer
a
terrible
example
of
the
dangers
of
enthusiasm
and
of
the
want
of
enlightenment
on
religious
matters
be
of
good
cheer
my
child
he
who
fathoms
our
thoughts
and
our
hearts
will
judge
you
according
to
your
intentions
which
were
pure
and
not
from
your
action
which
was
condemnable
as
for
life
if
the
moment
has
come
for
you
to
sleep
in
the
lord
ah
my
child
you
lose
but
little
by
losing
this
world
in
spite
of
the
solitude
in
which
you
have
lived
you
have
known
sorrow
what
would
you
have
felt
then
if
you
had
witnessed
the
evils
of
society
if
on
visiting
the
shores
of
europe
your
ear
had
been
stricken
by
the
long
cry
of
suffering
heard
throughout
that
old
land
the
dweller
in
the
cabin
the
inhabitant
of
a
palace
both
suffer
and
groan
here
below
queens
have
been
seen
to
cry
like
simple
women
and
people
have
been
astonished
at
the
quantity
of
tears
shed
by
kings
is
it
your
love
that
you
regret
my
daughter
you
might
as
well
weep
over
a
dream
do
you
know
the
heart
of
man
and
could
you
reckon
upon
the
inconstancies
of
his
affection
sacrifices
and
kindnesses
atala
are
not
eternal
ties
one
day
perhaps
disgust
would
have
come
with
satiety
the
past
would
have
been
considered
as
nothing
and
naught
would
have
remained
but
the
inconveniences
of
a
poor
and
despised
union
doubtless
my
dear
daughter
the
most
beautiful
loves
were
those
of
the
man
and
woman
who
issued
from
the
hand
of
the
creator
a
paradise
had
been
prepared
for
them
they
were
innocent
and
immortal
perfect
in
soul
and
body
they
suited
each
other
in
every
respect
eve
had
been
created
for
adam
l
and
adam
for
eve
if
they
nevertheless
could
not
remain
in
that
state
of
happiness
what
couple
after
them
could
do
so
i
will
not
speak
to
you
of
the
marriages
of
the
of
men
of
those
ineffable
unions
between
sister
and
brother
in
which
love
and
friendship
were
confounded
in
the
same
heart
and
the
purity
of
the
one
increased
the
delights
of
the
other
all
those
unions
were
troubled
jealousy
crept
over
the
altar
of
turf
upon
which
the
goat
was
sacrificed
it
existed
beneath
the
tent
of
abraham
and
even
in
the
abodes
of
the
patriarchs
where
they
experienced
so
much
joy
that
they
forgot
the
death
of
their
mothers
do
you
suppose
then
my
child
that
you
are
more
innocent
and
more
fortunate
in
your
ties
than
those
holy
families
from
which
jesus
christ
deigned
to
descend
again
woman
renews
her
sufferings
each
time
she
becomes
a
mother
and
she
weeps
on
her
what
grief
there
is
for
her
in
the
mere
loss
of
her
babe
to
whom
she
gave
nourishment
and
who
dies
upon
her
bosom
the
mountain
was
full
of
groans
nothing
could
console
rachel
for
the
loss
of
her
sons
the
bitterness
attendant
upon
human
affections
is
so
powerful
that
i
have
in
my
country
seen
grand
ladies
the
beloved
of
kings
quit
the
life
of
a
court
to
bury
themselves
in
a
cloister
and
mutilate
that
rebellious
flesh
the
pleasures
of
which
are
only
the
precursors
of
sorrow
but
perhaps
you
would
say
that
these
last
examples
do
not
affect
you
that
all
your
ambition
was
limited
to
the
desire
of
living
in
an
obscure
cabin
with
the
man
of
your
choice
that
you
sought
less
after
the
sweets
of
marriage
than
after
the
charms
of
that
folly
which
youth
calls
love
delusion
chimera
vanity
the
dream
of
a
diseased
imagination
i
also
my
daughter
have
known
the
troubles
of
the
heart
this
head
has
not
been
always
bald
nor
this
breast
always
so
calm
as
it
appears
to
you
believe
in
my
experience
if
man
constant
in
his
affections
could
unceasingly
respond
to
a
sentiment
constantly
renewed
solitude
and
love
would
doubtless
render
him
the
equal
of
god
himself
for
those
are
the
two
eternal
pleasures
of
the
great
being
but
the
soul
of
man
becomes
weary
and
never
loves
the
same
object
long
and
fully
there
are
always
some
points
upon
which
two
hearts
do
not
agree
and
in
the
end
those
points
suffice
to
render
life
insupportable
finally
my
dear
child
the
great
error
of
men
in
their
dream
of
happiness
is
that
they
forget
the
infirmity
of
death
inseparable
from
their
nature
the
end
must
come
sooner
or
later
whatever
might
have
been
your
felicity
your
beautiful
visage
would
have
been
changed
into
that
uniform
face
which
the
sepulchre
gives
to
the
family
of
adam
even
the
eye
of
chactas
would
not
have
been
able
to
distinguish
you
from
amongst
your
sisters
of
the
tomb
love
does
not
extend
its
empire
so
far
as
the
worms
in
the
coffin
what
have
i
to
say
o
vanity
of
vanities
what
can
i
say
concerning
the
durability
of
earthly
friendships
would
you
my
dear
daughter
know
its
extent
if
a
man
were
to
return
to
light
some
years
after
his
death
i
do
not
believe
he
would
be
received
with
joy
even
by
those
who
had
shed
the
most
tears
to
his
memory
so
quickly
are
new
ties
contracted
so
easily
fresh
habits
are
indulged
in
so
entirely
is
inconstancy
natural
to
man
and
so
little
is
our
life
even
in
the
hearts
of
our
friends
thank
therefore
the
divine
goodness
my
dear
daughter
for
taking
you
away
thus
early
from
this
valley
of
misery
already
the
white
robe
and
the
brilliant
crown
of
virgins
are
being
prepared
for
you
in
the
skies
already
i
hear
the
queen
of
the
angels
crying
out
to
you
come
my
worthy
servant
come
my
dove
come
and
sit
down
upon
the
throne
of
candor
amidst
all
those
maidens
who
have
sacrificed
their
beauty
and
their
youth
in
the
service
of
humanity
in
the
education
of
children
and
in
works
of
as
the
last
ray
of
daylight
stills
the
winds
and
spreads
tranquillity
through
the
sky
so
the
old
man
s
calm
language
appeased
the
passions
in
the
bosom
of
my
lover
she
no
longer
thought
of
anything
but
my
grief
and
of
the
means
for
enabling
me
to
support
her
loss
at
first
she
said
that
she
should
die
happy
if
i
would
promise
her
to
dry
my
tears
then
she
spoke
to
me
of
my
mother
and
of
my
country
and
endeavored
to
distract
me
from
present
grief
by
referring
to
past
sufferings
she
exhorted
me
to
patience
and
virtue
you
will
not
always
be
unhappy
she
said
if
heaven
tries
you
it
is
merely
to
render
you
more
compassionate
for
the
ills
of
others
the
heart
chactas
is
like
those
trees
that
only
yield
their
balm
for
healing
men
s
wounds
after
having
been
themselves
seared
with
when
she
had
thus
spoken
atala
turned
towards
the
missionary
seeking
from
him
the
consolation
she
had
been
endeavoring
to
impart
to
me
and
by
turns
consoling
and
consoled
she
gave
and
received
the
word
of
life
upon
the
couch
of
death
nevertheless
the
hermit
redoubled
his
zeal
with
the
torch
of
religion
in
his
hand
he
appeared
to
be
guiding
atala
to
the
tomb
to
show
her
its
secret
wonders
the
humble
grotto
was
full
of
the
grandeur
of
this
christian
agony
and
the
heavenly
spirits
were
no
doubt
attentive
to
the
scene
in
which
religion
had
to
struggle
alone
against
love
youth
and
death
divine
religion
triumphed
and
her
victory
was
perceptible
from
the
holy
sadness
that
followed
our
hearts
previous
passionate
transports
towards
the
middle
of
the
night
atala
seemed
to
revive
and
repeated
the
prayers
pronounced
by
the
monk
at
the
side
of
her
couch
shortly
afterwards
she
offered
me
her
hand
and
in
a
voice
scarcely
audible
said
son
of
outalissi
do
you
remember
the
night
when
you
took
me
for
the
virgin
of
the
last
loves
what
a
singular
omen
of
our
destiny
she
stopped
then
continued
when
i
think
that
i
am
leaving
you
for
ever
my
heart
makes
such
an
effort
to
live
that
i
feel
almost
strong
enough
to
render
myself
immortal
by
the
power
of
my
love
but
o
god
thy
will
be
done
atala
became
silent
during
a
few
instants
then
she
added
it
only
remains
for
me
to
ask
your
pardon
for
all
the
ills
i
have
caused
you
chactas
a
little
earth
thrown
upon
my
body
will
place
a
world
between
you
and
me
and
will
deliver
you
forever
from
the
weight
of
my
calamities
pardon
you
i
exclaimed
drowned
in
tears
is
it
not
i
who
have
caused
all
your
misfortunes
my
friend
she
replied
interrupting
me
you
have
rendered
me
very
happy
and
if
i
had
to
begin
my
life
over
again
i
should
still
prefer
the
happiness
of
having
loved
you
for
a
few
short
moments
in
an
exile
of
adversity
to
an
entire
life
of
repose
in
my
own
illustration
here
atala
s
voice
languished
the
shadows
of
death
spread
themselves
about
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
her
wandering
fingers
endeavored
to
catch
at
something
and
she
spoke
lowly
with
the
invisible
spirits
soon
however
making
an
effort
she
attempted
but
in
vain
to
take
the
little
crucifix
from
her
neck
she
asked
me
to
untie
it
myself
and
then
said
to
me
illustration
when
i
spoke
to
you
for
the
first
time
by
the
light
of
the
fire
you
saw
this
cross
shining
upon
my
bosom
it
is
the
only
treasure
that
atala
possesses
lopez
your
father
and
mine
sent
it
to
my
mother
a
few
days
after
my
birth
accept
the
inheritance
then
from
me
my
brother
and
keep
it
in
remembrance
of
my
misfortunes
chactas
i
have
a
last
request
to
make
of
you
our
union
on
earth
my
friend
would
have
been
short
but
after
this
life
there
is
a
longer
life
i
only
go
before
you
and
i
will
wait
for
you
in
the
celestial
empire
if
you
have
loved
me
get
yourself
instructed
in
the
christian
religion
which
will
prepare
our
that
religion
has
worked
a
great
miracle
under
your
own
eyes
since
it
enables
me
to
quit
you
without
the
anguish
of
despair
still
chactas
i
only
desire
you
to
make
me
a
simple
promise
i
know
too
well
what
it
costs
to
ask
an
oath
from
you
perhaps
such
a
vow
might
separate
you
from
some
woman
happier
than
o
my
mother
pardon
thy
daughter
i
am
again
succumbing
to
my
weaknesses
and
am
turning
aside
from
thee
o
my
god
thoughts
that
should
be
thine
and
thine
only
overwhelmed
with
grief
i
promised
atala
that
i
would
one
day
embrace
the
christian
religion
at
this
moment
the
hermit
rising
with
an
inspired
air
and
stretching
his
arms
towards
the
roof
of
the
grotto
exclaimed
it
is
time
it
is
time
to
call
god
hither
scarcely
had
he
uttered
those
words
when
a
supernatural
force
constrained
me
to
fall
upon
my
knees
and
to
turn
my
head
towards
the
foot
of
atala
s
couch
the
priest
opened
a
secret
place
that
contained
a
golden
urn
covered
with
a
silk
veil
he
then
knelt
down
and
prayed
fervently
suddenly
the
grotto
appeared
to
be
illuminated
songs
of
angels
and
the
vibrations
of
celestial
harps
were
heard
in
the
air
and
when
the
hermit
drew
the
sacred
vessel
from
the
tabernacle
i
thought
i
saw
god
himself
issue
forth
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
the
priest
opened
the
cup
took
between
his
fingers
a
wafer
white
as
snow
and
approached
atala
as
he
pronounced
some
mysterious
words
that
saint
s
eyes
were
upturned
in
ecstacy
all
her
sufferings
appeared
to
be
suspended
her
entire
being
concentrated
itself
upon
her
mouth
her
lips
parted
and
advanced
with
respect
to
seek
the
god
concealed
beneath
the
mystic
bread
the
saintly
old
man
afterwards
soaked
a
piece
of
cotton
in
the
consecrated
oil
and
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
dying
maiden
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
uttered
these
imposing
words
go
christian
soul
go
return
to
your
creator
raising
then
my
downcast
head
i
cried
looking
at
the
vessel
that
contained
the
holy
oil
my
father
will
that
remedy
restore
atala
to
life
yes
my
son
said
the
old
man
falling
into
my
arms
to
life
eternal
atala
had
just
expired
at
this
point
chactas
was
obliged
for
the
second
time
to
interrupt
the
recital
of
his
story
his
tears
flowed
copiously
and
the
tremor
of
his
voice
only
permitted
him
to
utter
broken
words
the
blind
sachem
opened
his
breast
and
drew
forth
atala
s
crucifix
here
it
is
he
cried
dear
token
of
adversity
o
rené
o
my
son
you
see
it
but
i
can
see
it
no
longer
tell
me
whether
after
so
many
years
the
gold
of
it
is
tarnished
do
you
see
any
traces
of
my
tears
upon
it
could
you
recognize
the
part
which
had
been
touched
by
the
lips
of
a
saint
how
is
it
that
chactas
is
not
yet
a
christian
what
trivial
motives
of
policy
or
nationality
have
kept
him
in
the
errors
of
his
fathers
no
i
will
no
longer
delay
the
earth
is
crying
out
to
me
when
then
wilt
thou
go
down
into
the
tomb
and
for
what
art
thou
waiting
to
embrace
a
divine
religion
earth
thou
shalt
not
wait
long
for
as
soon
as
a
priest
shall
have
regenerated
by
baptism
this
head
whitened
with
grief
i
hope
to
be
to
atala
but
let
me
finish
what
remains
to
be
told
of
my
illustration
illustration
illustration
illustration
i
the
funeral
illustration
i
will
not
undertake
rené
to
picture
the
despair
that
took
possession
of
my
soul
when
atala
had
heaved
her
last
sigh
it
would
require
more
warmth
than
i
have
left
and
that
my
closed
eyes
might
to
the
sun
to
ask
it
to
tell
of
the
tears
they
shed
in
its
light
yes
the
moon
now
shining
above
our
heads
will
become
weary
of
lighting
the
solitudes
of
kentucky
the
river
that
is
now
bearing
our
pirogues
will
suspend
the
course
of
its
waters
before
my
tears
cease
to
flow
for
atala
during
two
days
i
was
insensible
to
the
hermit
s
conversation
in
trying
to
calm
my
grief
the
excellent
man
did
not
employ
the
commonplace
reasonings
of
earthly
minds
all
he
said
was
my
son
it
is
the
will
of
god
and
then
he
pressed
me
in
his
arms
i
should
never
have
thought
there
was
so
much
consolation
in
those
few
words
of
a
resigned
christian
if
i
had
not
myself
experienced
it
the
mild
tenderness
and
the
unvarying
patience
of
the
old
servant
of
god
at
length
conquered
the
obstinacy
of
my
grief
i
became
ashamed
of
the
tears
i
caused
him
to
shed
my
father
i
said
this
is
too
much
let
the
passions
of
a
young
man
disturb
the
peace
of
your
days
no
longer
permit
me
to
carry
away
the
remains
of
my
spouse
i
will
inter
them
in
some
corner
of
the
desert
and
if
i
am
condemned
to
live
on
for
a
time
i
will
endeavor
to
render
myself
worthy
of
the
eternal
nuptials
that
were
promised
me
by
at
this
unexpected
return
of
courage
the
good
father
trembled
with
joy
saying
o
blood
of
jesus
christ
blood
of
my
divine
master
i
acknowledge
herein
thy
merits
thou
wilt
no
doubt
save
this
young
man
my
god
finish
thy
work
restore
peace
to
this
troubled
soul
and
leave
it
but
the
humble
and
useful
remembrances
of
its
misfortunes
the
righteous
man
refused
to
give
up
to
me
the
body
of
lopez
s
daughter
but
he
proposed
to
call
together
his
neophytes
and
to
inter
it
with
all
the
pomp
of
the
christian
ceremonial
in
my
turn
i
refused
atala
s
misfortunes
and
virtues
i
said
were
unknown
to
men
let
her
grave
dug
secretly
by
our
hands
share
that
we
agreed
to
set
off
the
next
morning
at
sunrise
and
to
bury
atala
beneath
the
arch
of
the
natural
bridge
at
the
entrance
to
the
groves
of
death
it
was
also
decided
that
we
should
pass
the
night
in
prayer
near
the
corpse
of
the
saint
towards
evening
we
transported
the
precious
remains
to
an
opening
of
the
grotto
looking
to
the
north
the
hermit
had
enveloped
them
in
a
piece
of
european
lawn
woven
by
his
mother
it
was
the
only
thing
still
remaining
to
him
of
his
country
and
he
had
long
preserved
it
for
his
own
tomb
we
laid
atala
upon
a
turf
of
her
feet
her
head
her
shoulders
and
a
part
of
her
bosom
were
uncovered
there
was
a
faded
magnolia
in
her
hair
the
same
flower
i
had
placed
upon
the
virgin
s
couch
to
render
her
fruitful
her
lips
like
a
gathered
two
mornings
before
seemed
to
languish
and
smile
her
cheeks
of
sparkling
whiteness
showed
a
number
of
blue
veins
her
beautiful
eyes
were
closed
her
modest
feet
joined
together
and
her
hands
of
alabaster
pressed
against
her
heart
an
ebony
crucifix
the
scapulary
of
her
vows
was
fastened
about
her
neck
she
appeared
as
though
enchanted
by
the
angel
of
melancholy
and
by
the
double
sleep
of
innocence
and
of
the
tomb
i
never
saw
anything
so
heavenly
by
a
person
unconscious
that
this
young
girl
had
enjoyed
the
light
she
might
have
been
taken
for
a
statue
of
sleeping
virginity
the
monk
did
not
cease
praying
all
night
i
sat
in
silence
at
the
end
of
my
atala
s
funeral
couch
how
often
during
her
sleep
i
had
held
that
charming
head
upon
my
knees
how
many
times
i
had
leaned
over
her
to
hear
her
breathe
and
to
inhale
her
breath
but
at
present
no
sound
issued
from
that
motionless
breast
and
it
was
in
vain
that
i
looked
for
the
awakening
of
my
love
the
moon
lent
her
pale
light
to
this
funereal
watching
she
rose
in
the
middle
of
the
night
like
a
white
vestal
come
to
weep
over
the
coffin
of
a
companion
from
time
to
time
the
monk
dipped
a
flowering
branch
into
the
holy
water
and
shaking
its
moistened
leaves
perfumed
the
night
air
with
heavenly
balms
occasionally
also
he
repeated
to
an
ancient
tune
these
verses
by
an
old
poet
named
job
illustration
i
have
passed
away
like
a
flower
i
have
withered
like
the
grass
of
the
fields
wherefore
is
light
given
to
him
that
is
in
misery
and
life
unto
the
bitter
in
soul
thus
sang
the
old
man
his
deep
and
irregular
voice
went
rolling
through
the
silence
of
the
desert
the
name
of
god
and
of
the
tomb
issued
from
all
the
echoes
from
all
the
torrents
and
from
all
the
forests
and
the
groves
of
death
seemed
to
be
murmuring
a
distant
chorus
of
the
departed
in
reply
to
the
hermit
s
sacred
chant
nevertheless
a
bar
of
gold
was
forming
in
the
east
the
were
crying
upon
the
rocks
and
the
martins
creeping
back
into
the
hollows
of
the
these
were
so
many
signs
that
the
time
had
come
for
atala
s
interment
i
took
the
body
on
my
shoulders
the
hermit
walked
in
front
of
me
carrying
a
spade
in
his
hand
we
commenced
the
descent
from
rock
to
rock
old
age
and
death
combined
equally
to
slacken
our
pace
at
the
sight
of
the
dog
which
had
found
us
in
the
forest
and
which
now
jumping
with
joy
led
us
by
another
route
i
melted
into
tears
atala
s
long
hair
the
plaything
of
the
morning
breezes
frequently
threw
its
golden
veil
over
my
eyes
and
bending
beneath
the
burden
i
was
obliged
to
lay
it
down
often
upon
the
moss
and
sit
awhile
to
recover
my
strength
at
length
we
arrived
at
the
spot
selected
by
my
grief
and
we
entered
beneath
the
arch
of
the
bridge
o
my
son
you
should
have
seen
the
youthful
savage
and
the
old
hermit
on
their
knees
in
front
of
each
other
in
the
desert
digging
with
their
hands
a
grave
for
the
poor
girl
whose
body
lay
stretched
out
close
at
hand
in
the
bed
of
a
torrent
when
our
work
was
terminated
we
transported
the
loved
one
into
her
bed
of
clay
taking
then
a
little
dust
in
my
hand
and
observing
a
fearful
silence
i
looked
upon
atala
s
face
for
the
last
time
i
afterwards
spread
the
earth
over
that
forehead
of
eighteen
springs
gradually
i
saw
the
features
of
my
sister
disappear
and
her
graces
become
hidden
beneath
the
curtain
of
eternity
lopez
i
exclaimed
behold
your
son
burying
your
daughter
and
i
finished
by
covering
atala
entirely
with
the
earth
of
sleep
we
returned
to
the
grotto
where
i
made
the
missionary
acquainted
with
the
project
i
had
formed
of
remaining
with
him
the
saint
who
wonderfully
understood
the
heart
of
man
penetrated
my
thought
and
the
artfulness
of
my
grief
he
said
chactas
son
of
outalissi
so
long
as
atala
was
alive
i
myself
desired
that
you
should
live
with
me
but
at
present
your
lot
is
changed
you
owe
yourself
to
your
country
believe
me
my
son
such
griefs
are
not
eternal
sooner
or
later
they
wear
themselves
out
because
the
heart
of
man
is
finite
that
is
one
of
our
great
miseries
we
are
not
even
capable
of
being
unhappy
for
a
long
time
return
to
the
mississippi
go
and
console
your
mother
who
weeps
for
you
day
by
day
and
who
stands
in
need
of
your
support
get
yourself
instructed
in
atala
s
religion
whenever
an
opportunity
presents
itself
and
remember
that
you
promised
her
to
be
virtuous
and
christian
i
will
watch
over
her
tomb
go
my
son
god
your
sister
s
soul
and
the
heart
of
your
old
friend
will
follow
you
such
was
the
language
of
the
man
of
the
rock
his
authority
was
too
great
his
wisdom
too
profound
not
to
be
obeyed
the
next
morning
i
quitted
my
venerable
host
who
pressing
me
to
his
heart
gave
me
his
last
counsels
his
last
blessing
and
his
last
tears
i
went
to
the
grave
and
was
surprised
at
finding
a
little
cross
placed
over
the
body
as
one
may
sometimes
perceive
the
mast
of
a
vessel
that
has
been
wrecked
i
judged
that
the
hermit
had
been
there
to
pray
during
the
night
this
mark
of
friendship
and
religion
caused
me
to
shed
an
abundance
of
tears
i
was
almost
tempted
to
the
tomb
in
order
to
gaze
once
more
upon
my
a
religious
fear
withheld
me
i
sat
down
upon
the
ground
with
an
elbow
resting
upon
my
knees
and
my
head
supported
by
my
hand
i
remained
buried
for
a
time
in
a
most
bitter
reverie
o
rené
it
was
then
that
for
the
first
time
i
made
serious
reflections
upon
the
vanity
of
our
days
and
the
still
greater
vanity
of
our
projects
ah
my
child
who
has
not
made
such
reflections
i
am
no
longer
but
an
old
stag
whitened
by
the
winters
my
years
compete
with
those
of
the
crow
well
in
spite
of
the
number
of
days
accumulated
over
my
head
in
spite
of
such
a
long
experience
of
life
i
have
not
yet
met
with
a
man
who
had
not
been
deceived
in
his
dreams
of
happiness
nor
a
heart
that
did
not
contain
a
hidden
wound
having
thus
seen
the
sun
rise
and
set
upon
this
place
of
grief
the
next
day
at
the
first
cry
of
the
stork
i
prepared
to
leave
the
sacred
sepulchre
i
quitted
it
as
the
spot
from
which
i
desired
to
start
upon
a
career
of
virtue
three
times
i
evoked
the
soul
of
atala
three
times
the
genius
of
the
desert
responded
to
my
cries
beneath
the
funeral
arch
i
afterwards
saluted
the
east
and
then
i
perceived
amongst
the
mountain
paths
in
the
distance
the
friendly
hermit
going
to
the
cabin
of
some
unhappy
creature
falling
upon
my
knees
and
ardently
embracing
atala
s
grave
i
exclaimed
sleep
in
peace
in
this
foreign
land
too
unfortunate
maiden
in
return
for
your
love
for
your
exile
and
for
your
death
you
are
going
to
be
abandoned
even
by
chactas
then
shedding
a
flood
of
tears
i
separated
from
lopez
s
daughter
and
tearing
myself
from
the
spot
left
at
the
foot
of
nature
s
monument
a
monument
still
more
august
the
humble
tomb

epilogue
illustration
chactas
son
of
outalissi
the
natchez
related
this
story
to
rené
the
european
fathers
have
repeated
it
to
their
sons
and
i
a
traveller
to
distant
lands
have
faithfully
narrated
what
the
indians
told
me
i
saw
in
this
story
the
picture
of
the
hunting
people
and
of
the
laboring
people
religion
the
first
lawgiver
of
men
the
dangers
of
ignorance
and
religious
enthusiasm
opposed
to
the
light
the
charity
and
the
veritable
spirit
of
the
evangile
the
struggles
of
the
passions
and
the
virtues
in
a
simple
heart
and
finally
the
triumph
of
christianity
over
the
most
ardent
sentiment
and
the
most
terrible
fear
love
and
death
when
a
seminole
related
this
story
to
me
i
found
it
very
instructive
and
perfectly
beautiful
because
he
narrated
it
with
the
flowery
eloquence
of
the
desert
the
grace
of
the
cabin
and
a
simplicity
in
describing
grief
which
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
been
able
to
preserve
but
one
thing
remained
for
me
to
learn
i
wished
to
know
what
had
become
of
father
aubry
and
no
one
could
tell
me
i
should
never
have
ascertained
if
providence
who
guides
all
had
not
led
me
to
discover
what
i
was
seeking
this
is
how
the
matter
came
about
i
had
visited
the
shores
of
the
mississippi
which
formerly
constituted
the
southern
boundary
of
new
france
and
i
was
desirous
of
seeing
in
the
north
that
other
wonder
of
the
american
empire
the
cataract
of
niagara
i
had
nearly
reached
the
falls
in
the
ancient
country
of
the
agannonsioni
when
one
morning
as
i
was
crossing
a
plain
i
perceived
a
woman
seated
beneath
a
tree
and
holding
a
dead
child
upon
her
knees
i
quietly
approached
the
young
mother
and
heard
her
singing
to
this
effect
if
thou
hadst
remained
amongst
us
dear
babe
with
what
grace
thy
hand
might
have
bent
the
bow
thy
arm
might
have
tamed
the
furious
bear
and
thy
steps
might
have
outrun
the
flying
kid
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
white
ermine
of
the
rock
to
go
so
young
to
the
land
of
souls
how
wilt
thou
manage
to
live
there
thy
father
is
not
there
to
feed
thee
with
the
produce
of
his
chase
thou
wilt
be
cold
and
no
spirit
will
give
thee
skins
to
cover
thyself
oh
i
must
hasten
to
rejoin
thee
to
sing
songs
to
thee
and
to
give
thee
my
and
the
young
mother
sang
with
a
trembling
voice
rocked
the
child
upon
her
knees
wetted
its
lips
with
her
maternal
milk
and
bestowed
upon
the
dead
all
those
cares
which
are
usually
given
to
the
living
according
to
the
indian
custom
the
woman
desired
to
dry
the
body
of
her
son
upon
the
branches
of
a
tree
before
taking
it
away
to
the
tomb
of
its
ancestors
she
therefore
undressed
the
babe
and
after
breathing
some
instants
upon
its
mouth
uncovered
its
breast
and
embraced
the
icy
remains
which
would
certainly
have
been
by
the
fire
of
that
maternal
heart
if
god
had
not
reserved
to
himself
the
breath
that
imparts
life
she
rose
and
looked
about
for
a
tree
upon
which
she
might
lay
her
child
she
selected
a
maple
with
red
flowers
festooned
with
garlands
of
apios
that
emitted
the
sweetest
perfumes
with
one
hand
she
pulled
down
the
lowest
branch
and
with
the
other
she
placed
the
body
thereon
then
loosing
the
branch
it
returned
to
its
natural
position
with
the
remains
of
innocence
concealed
in
its
ordoriforous
foliage
oh
how
touching
is
this
indian
custom
pompous
monuments
of
the
crassi
and
of
the
cæsars
i
have
seen
you
in
your
desolated
plains
but
i
by
far
prefer
those
aërian
tombs
of
the
savages
those
mausoleums
of
flowers
and
verdure
perfumed
by
the
bee
and
waved
by
the
zephyr
wherein
the
nightingale
builds
its
nest
and
warbles
its
plaintive
melody
when
the
mortal
remains
are
those
of
a
young
maiden
suspended
by
the
hand
of
a
lover
to
the
tree
of
death
or
of
a
beloved
child
placed
by
a
fond
mother
in
the
dwelling
of
the
little
birds
the
charm
is
still
greater
i
approached
her
who
was
groaning
at
the
foot
of
the
and
placed
my
hands
upon
her
head
as
i
uttered
the
three
cries
of
grief
afterwards
without
speaking
to
the
young
mother
i
imitated
her
by
taking
a
bough
and
driving
away
the
insects
that
were
buzzing
about
the
child
s
body
but
i
was
careful
not
to
disturb
a
neighboring
dove
the
indian
woman
said
to
it
dove
if
thou
art
not
the
soul
of
my
departed
son
thou
art
doubtless
a
mother
seeking
for
something
to
make
a
nest
take
these
hairs
which
i
shall
no
more
wash
in
scented
water
take
them
for
a
bed
for
thy
little
ones
and
may
the
great
spirit
preserve
them
to
thee
the
iroquois
nevertheless
the
mother
wept
with
joy
on
remarking
the
stranger
s
politeness
as
we
were
thus
occupied
a
young
man
came
up
and
said
daughter
of
céluta
take
down
our
child
we
will
no
longer
sojourn
in
this
place
we
will
set
off
at
the
rising
of
the
next
i
then
said
brother
i
wish
you
a
blue
sky
plenty
of
game
a
beaver
cloak
and
hope
you
are
not
of
the
desert
then
no
replied
the
young
man
we
are
exiles
and
we
are
going
to
seek
a
saying
that
the
warrior
lowered
his
head
upon
his
breast
and
began
knocking
off
the
heads
of
some
flowers
with
the
end
of
his
bow
i
saw
that
there
were
tears
at
the
bottom
of
this
story
so
i
remained
silent
the
mother
took
her
son
s
body
down
from
the
branch
of
the
tree
and
gave
it
to
her
spouse
to
carry
i
then
said
will
you
allow
me
to
light
your
fire
we
have
no
cottage
replied
the
warrior
but
if
you
desire
to
follow
us
we
are
going
to
camp
on
the
border
of
the
with
pleasure
i
replied
and
we
started
off
together
we
soon
arrived
at
the
border
of
the
cataract
which
announced
itself
with
frightful
roarings
it
is
formed
by
the
river
niagara
which
takes
its
rise
in
lake
erie
and
falls
into
lake
ontario
its
perpendicular
height
is
one
hundred
and
feet
from
lake
erie
to
the
falls
the
river
flows
with
a
rapid
inclination
and
at
the
leap
it
is
less
a
river
than
a
sea
whose
torrents
crush
each
other
in
the
yawning
mouth
of
an
abyss
the
cataract
is
divided
into
two
branches
and
bends
like
a
between
the
two
falls
there
is
an
island
hollow
underneath
and
which
hangs
with
all
its
trees
over
the
chaos
of
the
waves
the
mass
of
the
river
which
rushes
towards
the
north
assumes
the
form
of
a
vast
cylinder
unrolling
itself
into
a
field
of
snow
and
shining
with
every
color
in
the
sun
that
which
flows
to
the
east
descends
into
a
fearful
shade
and
might
be
taken
for
a
column
of
the
water
of
the
deluge
a
thousand
rainbows
bend
and
cross
each
other
above
the
abyss
striking
against
the
shaken
rock
the
water
rebounds
in
whirlwinds
of
froth
that
rise
above
the
forests
like
smoke
from
a
vast
burning
mass
and
rocks
worn
into
fantastic
forms
ornament
the
scene
eagles
carried
along
by
the
current
of
air
are
whirled
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
and
carcajous
hanging
by
their
flexible
tails
to
the
ends
of
the
fallen
branches
wait
to
seize
in
the
abyss
the
crushed
bodies
of
bears
and
elks
whilst
i
was
contemplating
this
spectacle
with
a
sort
of
pleasure
mixed
with
terror
the
indian
and
his
spouse
left
me
i
looked
for
them
as
i
ascended
the
above
the
falls
and
soon
discovered
them
in
a
place
suited
to
their
grief
they
were
lying
down
upon
the
grass
with
a
number
of
old
men
near
some
human
bones
wrapped
in
astonished
at
everything
i
had
seen
during
the
last
few
hours
i
sat
down
near
the
young
mother
and
said
what
is
all
this
my
sister
she
replied
my
brother
the
earth
of
our
country
and
the
ashes
of
our
forefathers
follow
us
in
our
and
how
i
asked
have
you
been
reduced
to
such
a
misfortune
the
daughter
of
céluta
responded
we
are
the
remains
of
the
natchez
after
the
massacre
of
our
nation
by
the
french
to
avenge
their
compatriots
those
of
our
brothers
who
escaped
from
the
conquerors
found
refuge
with
our
neighbors
the
chikassas
we
remained
tranquilly
with
them
for
some
time
but
seven
moons
ago
the
white
men
from
virginia
took
possession
of
our
fields
affirming
that
they
had
been
given
to
them
by
a
king
of
europe
so
we
raised
our
eyes
to
heaven
and
laden
with
the
remains
of
our
forefathers
started
on
our
way
across
the
desert
i
was
confined
during
the
march
and
as
my
milk
was
bad
on
account
of
my
grief
it
caused
my
child
to
as
she
spoke
the
mother
wiped
her
eyes
with
her
hair
i
wept
also
after
a
while
i
said
my
sister
let
us
adore
the
great
spirit
everything
happens
by
his
command
we
are
all
travellers
our
fathers
were
the
same
but
there
is
a
place
where
we
shall
find
rest
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
my
tongue
being
as
indiscreet
as
that
of
a
white
man
i
would
ask
of
you
if
you
have
heard
speak
of
chactas
the
at
these
words
the
indian
woman
looked
at
me
and
asked
who
has
spoken
to
you
of
chactas
the
natchez
i
replied
the
indian
rejoined
i
will
tell
you
what
i
know
because
you
drove
away
the
flies
from
the
body
of
my
son
and
uttered
good
words
concerning
the
great
spirit
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
daughter
of
rené
the
european
whom
chactas
had
adopted
chactas
who
had
received
baptism
and
rené
my
unfortunate
grandfather
perished
in
the
man
passes
constantly
from
grief
to
grief
i
replied
bending
myself
with
humility
you
might
also
perhaps
be
able
to
give
me
news
of
father
aubry
he
was
not
more
fortunate
than
chactas
said
the
indian
the
cherokees
who
were
hostile
to
the
french
attacked
his
mission
they
were
guided
thither
by
the
sound
of
a
bell
that
was
rung
to
succor
travellers
father
aubry
could
have
escaped
but
he
would
not
abandon
his
children
and
remained
to
encourage
them
to
die
by
his
example
he
was
burnt
with
great
torture
but
his
enemies
could
not
draw
from
him
a
single
cry
that
might
be
turned
to
the
shame
of
his
god
or
to
the
dishonor
of
his
country
during
the
punishment
he
never
ceased
to
pray
for
his
executioners
and
to
pity
the
lot
of
his
in
order
to
compel
him
to
betray
a
mark
of
weakness
the
cherokees
led
to
his
feet
a
christian
savage
whom
they
had
horribly
mutilated
but
they
were
much
surprised
when
they
saw
the
young
man
go
down
upon
his
knees
and
kiss
the
wounds
of
the
old
hermit
who
cried
out
to
him
my
child
we
have
been
given
as
a
spectacle
to
men
and
to
the
the
indians
furious
at
his
expression
forced
a
iron
down
his
throat
to
prevent
him
from
speaking
and
thereupon
no
longer
able
to
console
his
he
expired
it
is
said
that
the
cherokees
accustomed
though
they
were
to
see
savages
suffer
with
indifference
could
not
refrain
from
confessing
that
there
was
in
father
aubry
s
courage
something
unknown
to
them
and
which
surpassed
every
description
of
courage
they
had
witnessed
several
of
them
struck
by
his
remarkable
death
afterwards
became

his

having
heard
of
the
misfortunes
of
the
chief
of
prayer
went
to
gather
the
father
s
ashes
and
those
of
atala
he
arrived
at
the
spot
where
the
mission
had
formerly
existed
but
he
could
scarcely
recognize
it
the
lake
was
overflown
and
the
savannah
changed
into
a
marsh
the
natural
bridge
which
had
fallen
in
had
buried
atala
s
tomb
and
the
groves
of
death
beneath
its
ruins
chactas
wandered
about
the
place
for
a
length
of
time
he
visited
the
hermit
s
grotto
which
he
found
full
of
weeds
and
and
occupied
by
a
fawn
giving
suck
to
her
kid
he
sat
down
upon
the
rock
beneath
which
he
had
watched
his
dying
atala
but
there
was
nothing
on
it
beyond
a
few
feathers
fallen
from
the
wings
of
some
birds
of
passage
while
he
was
weeping
the
missionary
s
tamed
serpent
issued
from
the
neighboring
bushes
and
came
creeping
to
his
feet
chactas
warmed
in
his
bosom
the
faithful
friend
who
had
remained
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
ruins
the
son
of
outalissi
stated
that
several
times
at
the
approach
of
night
he
fancied
he
saw
the
shades
of
atala
and
father
aubry
rise
out
of
the
misty
twilight
these
visions
filled
him
with
religious
fear
and
a
joyful
sadness

after
having
sought
the
tomb
of
his
sister
and
of
the
hermit
in
vain
he
was
on
the
point
of
abandoning
the
spot
when
the
fawn
from
the
grotto
set
to
leaping
in
front
of
him
she
stopped
at
the
foot
of
the
mission
cross
that
cross
was
then
half
surrounded
by
water
the
wood
of
it
was
covered
with
moss
and
the
pelican
of
the
wilderness
loved
to
perch
upon
its
arms
chactas
judged
that
the
graceful
fawn
had
led
him
to
the
tomb
of
his
host
he
dug
below
the
rock
that
had
formerly
served
as
an
altar
and
there
found
the
remains
of
a
man
and
woman
he
had
no
doubt
but
they
were
those
of
the
priest
and
of
the
virgin
buried
perhaps
by
the
angels
in
that
place
so
he
wrapped
them
in
and
started
on
his
way
back
to
his
country
carrying
off
the
precious
remains
which
sounded
on
his
shoulders
like
the
quiver
of
death
at
night
he
placed
them
under
his
pillow
and
had
dreams
of
love
and
of
virtue
o
stranger
you
may
here
contemplate
that
dust
and
also
the
remains
of
chactas
as
the
indian
finished
speaking
i
rose
went
towards
the
sacred
ashes
and
prostrated
myself
before
them
in
silence
i
afterwards
walked
away
slowly

long
strides
saying
to
myself
thus
ends
upon

art

a
rapid
and
painful
dream
thou
only
existest
by
misfortune
and
if
thou
art
anything
at
all
it
is
merely
by
the
sadness
of
thy
soul
and
the
eternal
melancholy
of
thy
thoughts
i
was
preoccupied
with
such
reflections
all
night
the
next
morning
at
my
hosts
left

their
