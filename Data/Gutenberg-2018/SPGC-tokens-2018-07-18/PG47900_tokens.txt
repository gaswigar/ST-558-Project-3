moira
talked

through

the

the

reflection
pale
and
somber
splendid
jim
horton
awoke
in
high
fever
and
great
pain
but
the
operation
upon
his
skull
had
been
successful
and
it
was
believed
that
he
would
recover
something
as
to
the
facts
of
the
exploit
of
the
wounded
man
had
come
to
the
hospital
and
he
was
an
object
of
especial
solicitude
by
both
surgeons
and
nurses
they
had
worked
hard
to
save
him
that
he
might
be
alive
for
the
decoration
that
was
sure
to
come
and
the
night
had
brought
a
distinct
improvement
in
his
condition
the
nurse
still
watched
his
breathing
eagerly
and
wrote
down
the
new
and
favorable
record
upon
the
chart
by
his
bedside
miss
newberry
was
not
in
the
least
sentimental
and
the
war
had
blunted
her
sensibilities
but
there
was
no
denying
the
fact
that
when
the
dressing
was
removed
from
his
head
the
patient
was
extremely
good
to
look
at
he
rewarded
her
on
the
morrow
with
a
smile
how
long
have
i
been
here
he
murmured
hazily
six
days
she
replied
but
you
mustn
t
talk
in
the
head
shoulder
and
leg
but
you
re
doing
nicely
won
t
you
tell
he
began
but
she
soothed
him
gently
not
perhaps
you
must
sleep
again
drink
horton
obeyed
for
he
found
himself
too
weak
to
oppose
her
it
was
very
restful
here
he
wriggled
his
toes
luxuriously
against
the
soft
sheets
for
a
moment
if
things
would
only
stop
whirling
around
and
the
pain
but
that
seemed
to
cease
again
and
he
slept
indeed
his
awakening
was
only
to
other
days
and
nights
followed
when
he
lay
in
a
sort
of
doze
aware
of
much
suffering
and
a
great
confusion
of
thought
but
slowly
as
he
grew
stronger
the
facts
of
his
present
position
emerged
from
the
dimness
and
with
them
a
mild
curiosity
scarcely
lucid
as
yet
as
to
how
he
had
gotten
there
at
last
there
came
a
morning
when
the
fog
upon
his
memory
seemed
to
roll
aside
and
he
began
to
recall
one
by
one
the
incidents
that
had
preceded
his
unconsciousness
there
had
been
a
fight
some
fight
that
was
huns
all
over
the
a
ring
around
the
rocks
up
in
the
branches
of
the
but
he
had
held
on
until
the
boches
had
started
to
run
when
the
american
line
advanced
he
remembered
that
the
engineers
could
do
other
things
besides
build
saps
and
bridges
good
old
engineers
something
was
out
of
his
clouded
brain
slowly
the
facts
came
to
that
had
happened
before
the
before
twin
brother
harry
lying
in
the
ditch
just
behind
jim
s
squad
of
engineers
a
coward
in
a
blue
to
carry
out
his
major
s
orders
to
go
forward
and
investigate
a
coward
of
course
harry
would
be
he
had
always
been
a
coward
jim
horton
sighed
his
mind
ambling
weakly
into
vacancy
suddenly
arrested
by
a
query
else
else
had
happened
something
to
do
with
the
remarkable
likeness
between
himself
and
harry
the
likeness
strong
that
only
their
own
mother
had
been
able
to
tell
them
apart
memory
came
to
him
with
a
rush
he
remembered
now
what
had
happened
in
the
darkness
what
he
had
done
taken
harry
s
lieutenant
s
uniform
giving
the
coward
his
own
corporal
s
outfit
then
he
jim
horton
had
gone
on
and
carried
out
the
major
s
orders
leaving
the
coward
writhing
in
the
ditch
by
george
jim
horton
had
won
the
victory
at
boissi√®re
wood
for
the
harry
perhaps
he
was
really
harry
and
not
jim
horton
at
all
he
glanced
around
him
curiously
as
though
somewhat
amused
at
the
metempyschosis
and
then
thoughtfully
shook
his
head
no
he
was
jim
horton
all
horton
there
was
no
mistake
about
that
but
harry
imagine
meeting
harry
in
a
situation
like
that
after
all
these
years
a
coward
not
that
that
was
a
very
surprising
thing
harry
had
always
been
a
quitter
there
was
nothing
that
harry
could
do
or
be
that
wasn
t
utterly
despicable
in
the
eyes
of
his
brother
jim
and
after
having
spent
the
best
part
of
five
years
trying
to
live
the
memory
of
harry
the
nurse
appeared
silently
and
looked
into
jim
horton
s
eyes
he
closed
them
a
moment
and
then
smiled
at
her
how
do
you
feel
she
asked
better
he
answered
you
see
i
can
really
i
wouldn
t
try
to
do
yet
oh
i
m
all
right
and
the
nurse
was
ready
for
the
first
time
to
believe
that
her
patient
was
to
remain
this
side
of
the
border
line
of
the
dim
realm
into
which
she
had
seen
so
many
go
for
his
eyes
were
clear
and
he
spoke
with
definite
assurance
but
the
question
that
he
asked
made
her
dubious
again
i
say
nurse
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
my
name
is
she
gazed
at
him
a
moment
as
though
a
little
disappointed
and
then
replied
quietly
lieutenant
henry
horton
of
the
infantry
oh
said
the
patient
i
see
i
think
you
d
better
sleep
a
while
then
i
want
the
major
to
see
you
oh
don
t
bother
i
m
coming
through
all
right
now
i
m
sure
of
it
but
i
want
to
tell
the
nurse
silenced
him
gently
then
felt
his
pulse
and
after
another
glance
at
him
moved
to
the
next
bed
it
had
been
a
wonderful
operation
but
then
they
couldn
t
expect
the
impossible
jim
horton
closed
his
eyes
but
he
didn
t
sleep
with
the
shadow
of
death
still
hovering
over
him
he
was
trying
to
think
charitably
of
harry
of
the
man
who
had
worked
such
havoc
in
the
lives
of
those
nearest
him
the
five
years
that
had
passed
since
the
death
of
their
tired
soul
who
until
the
end
believed
the
whole
thing
a
not
have
been
fruitful
in
anything
but
evil
in
the
life
of
the
reprobate
who
had
robbed
the
family
of
what
had
been
left
of
the
estate
and
then
fled
away
from
the
small
town
where
they
lived
to
the
gay
lights
of
new
york
and
now
here
he
officer
of
the
united
states
army
where
commissions
do
not
come
without
merit
what
did
it
mean
harry
was
always
clever
enough
too
clever
by
half
had
he
quit
drinking
was
he
living
straight
there
seemed
but
one
answer
to
these
questions
or
he
could
not
have
held
his
job
in
the
army
his
job
his
commission
wouldn
t
last
long
if
his
commanding
officer
knew
what
jim
horton
did
they
all
thought
that
the
patient
in
the
hospital
bed
was
harry
horton
a
lieutenant
of
the
infantry
the
corporal
had
won
the
lieutenant
some
glory
it
seemed
instead
of
the
ruin
that
awaited
the
discovery
of
the
cowardice
and
disobedience
of
orders
but
the
substitution
would
be
discovered
unless
jim
horton
could
find
his
brother
harry
and
how
was
he
going
to
manage
that
from
his
hospital
bed
a
gentle
perspiration
exuded
from
jim
horton
s
pores
being
surrounded
by
boches
in
the
wood
was
distinctly
less
hazardous
than
this
and
so
when
the
nurse
returned
with
the
major
he
did
his
best
to
straighten
out
the
tangle
the
major
was
much
pleased
at
the
patient
s
progress
made
a
suggestion
or
two
about
a
change
in
the
treatment
and
was
on
the
point
of
turning
away
when
horton
spoke
would
you
mind
a
word
of
course
something
bothering
you
yes
you
the
patient
hesitated
again
his
lip
twisting
this
whole
thing
is
a
mistake
the
doctor
eyed
the
sick
man
narrowly
a
mistake
and
then
kindly
i
don
t
understand
horton
frowned
at
the
you
see
sir
i
m
not
henry
horton
m
somebody
else
he
saw
the
nurse
and
the
doctor
exchange
glances
ah
well
said
the
medical
man
with
a
smile
i
wouldn
t
bother
about
it
but
i
bother
about
it
sir
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
i
m
another
man
i
changed
uniforms
another
fellow
in
the
dark
he
finished
uneasily
the
same
look
passed
between
nurse
and
surgeon
and
then
he
saw
miss
newberry
s
head
move
slightly
from
left
to
right
the
doctor
rose
oh
very
well
don
t
let
it
bother
you
my
man
we
ll
get
you
all
untangled
presently
just
try
not
to
think
you
re
doing
nicely
and
the
major
moved
slowly
down
the
ward
jim
horton
frowned
at
the
medical
officer
s
broad
back
thinks
i
m
nutty
he
muttered
to
himself
and
then
grinned
the
story
a
little
wild
when
the
major
had
left
the
ward
the
nurse
came
back
and
smoothed
horton
s
pillow
you
re
to
be
very
quiet
she
said
gently
and
sleep
all
you
can
but
nurse
he
protested
i
don
t
want
to
sleep
any
more
i
told
him
the
truth
i
ve
taken
another
man
s
place
you
did
it
very
well
from
all
accounts
she
said
with
a
smile
and
you
ll
take
another
man
s
before
long
they
say
what
do
you
mean
promotion
she
laughed
but
you
won
t
get
it
if
you
have
a
relapse
i
m
not
going
to
have
a
relapse
i
m
all
right
better
every
day
and
i
d
like
you
to
understand
that
i
know
exactly
what
i
m
saying
i
took
another
man
s
job
he
sick
and
i
took
his
place
i
m
not
lieutenant
horton
nurse
you
may
be
whatever
you
please
if
you
ll
only
go
to
sleep
bless
your
heart
that
isn
t
going
to
change
my
identity
his
positiveness
rather
startled
her
and
made
her
pause
and
stare
at
him
soberly
but
in
a
moment
her
lips
curved
into
a
smile
rather
tender
and
sympathetic
it
wouldn
t
do
to
let
this
illusion
grow
so
gently
she
said
your
authenticity
is
well
vouched
for
the
report
of
your
company
of
your
battalion
you
see
you
ve
become
rather
a
famous
person
in
the
i
ve
seen
some
of
your
papers
they
re
all
quite
regular
even
your
identification
disk
it
s
here
in
the
drawer
with
some
other
things
that
were
in
your
pockets
so
please
relax
and
sleep
again
won
t
you
i
mustn
t
talk
to
you
it
s
contrary
to
orders
but
she
patted
him
gently
on
the
arm
put
a
warning
finger
to
her
lips
and
silently
stole
away
his
gaze
followed
her
the
length
of
the
room
until
she
disappeared
through
the
door
when
he
sank
back
on
his
pillows
with
a
groan
nutty
he
muttered
to
himself
wonder
if
i
am
he
touched
the
bandage
and
realized
that
his
head
was
beginning
to
throb
again
no
i
m
jim
horton
all
right
there
s
no
doubt
about
that
but
how
i
m
going
to
make
these
seraphic
idiots
believe
it
is
more
than
i
can
see
that
sergeant
and
the
men
by
george
and
the
probably
looked
me
over
at
the
dressing
station
oh
lord
what
a
mess
things
began
whirling
around
and
jim
horton
closed
his
eyes
he
wasn
t
quite
as
strong
as
he
thought
he
was
and
after
a
while
he
slept
again
downstairs
in
the
major
s
office
two
surgeons
and
the
nurse
in
charge
were
discussing
the
case
queer
obsession
that
thinks
he
s
another
man
there
may
be
some
pressure
there
yet
it
ought
to
have
cleared
up
by
this
it
s
shock
sir
i
think
he
ll
come
out
of
it
he
s
coming
on
miss
newberry
splendidly
that
s
what
i
can
t
understand
he
as
though
he
knew
what
he
was
saying
any
chance
of
there
being
a
mistake
none
at
all
sir
doctor
rawson
came
down
with
him
in
the
ambulance
his
own
company
captain
was
there
when
the
patient
was
given
first
aid
he
would
have
known
his
own
lieutenant
sir
there
can
t
be
any
mistake
but
he
has
scarcely
any
never
mind
keep
an
extra
eye
on
him
the
wound
is
healing
nicely
he
ll
come
through
all
right
so
nurse
newberry
returned
to
the
ward
somewhat
gratified
to
find
her
charge
again
peacefully
asleep
the
next
day
the
patient
did
not
revert
to
his
obsession
but
lay
very
quiet
looking
out
of
the
window
his
failure
to
reveal
his
secret
left
him
moody
and
thoughtful
but
his
temperature
was
normal
and
he
was
without
pain
you
say
there
were
some
things
in
the
pockets
my
blouse
he
asked
of
the
nurse
yes
would
you
like
to
have
them
the
patient
nodded
and
she
gave
them
to
him
the
identification
disk
a
wrist
watch
some
money
a
and
some
papers
he
looked
them
over
in
an
abstracted
way
sinking
back
on
his
pillow
at
last
holding
the
letters
in
his
hand
then
at
last
as
though
coming
to
a
difficult
decision
he
took
one
of
the
letters
out
of
its
envelope
and
began
reading
it
was
in
a
feminine
hand
and
added
more
heavily
to
the
burden
of
his
responsibilities
dear
harry
it
ran
i
m
just
back
to
my
room
a
wife
of
three
hours
with
a
honeymoon
in
a
railway
station
it
all
seems
such
a
even
an
old
shoe
to
bless
myself
with
if
i
ve
helped
you
i
m
glad
of
it
but
i
m
not
going
to
lie
just
to
square
us
two
with
the
almighty
for
the
mockery
i
ve
been
through
i
don
t
love
you
harry
and
you
know
that
i
did
what
dad
asked
me
to
do
and
i
d
do
it
again
if
he
asked
me
he
seems
restless
and
talks
about
going
back
to
paris
i
suppose
i
could
do
something
over
there
for
i
ve
lost
all
impulse
for
my
work
perhaps
we
ll
come
and
then
you
could
run
up
and
see
us
i
ll
try
to
be
nice
to
you
harry
i
will
really
you
know
there
s
always
been
something
lacking
in
me
i
seem
to
have
given
everything
to
my
painting
so
there
s
very
little
left
for
you
which
is
the
irish
in
me
saying
i
m
a
heartless
hussy
soon
i
ll
be
sending
you
the
pair
of
gray
socks
which
i
knitted
with
my
own
hands
they
re
bunchy
in
spots
and
there
s
a
knot
or
two
here
and
there
but
i
hope
you
can
wear
the
deil
s
own
time
i
had
making
them
i
suppose
that
i
should
be
feeling
proud
at
my
sacrifice
i
don
t
somehow
but
i
ll
be
feeling
glad
if
you
have
another
bar
to
your
shoulder
that
might
make
me
proud
knowing
that
i
d
helped
moira
don
t
be
getting
killed
or
anything
i
never
wanted
to
marry
anybody
but
i
don
t
want
you
done
away
with
besides
i
ve
a
horror
of
cr√™pe
jim
horton
read
the
letter
through
furtively
with
a
growing
sense
of
intrusion
it
was
like
listening
at
a
confessional
or
peering
through
a
keyhole
and
somehow
its
ingenuous
frankness
aroused
his
interest
harry
had
been
married
to
this
girl
who
didn
t
love
him
and
she
had
consented
because
her
father
had
wanted
her
to
he
felt
unaccountably
indignant
on
her
account
against
harry
and
the
father
pretty
like
something
out
of
a
book
she
seemed
to
breathe
both
youth
and
hope
tinged
horribly
with
regret
he
liked
her
handwriting
which
had
dashed
into
her
thoughts
impulsively
and
he
also
liked
the
slight
scent
of
sachet
which
still
clung
to
the
paper
he
liked
the
girl
better
pitied
her
the
more
because
her
instinct
had
been
so
unerring
if
she
had
thrown
herself
away
she
had
done
it
with
her
eyes
wide
open
a
girl
who
could
make
such
a
sacrifice
from
lofty
motives
would
hardly
condone
the
thing
that
harry
had
been
guilty
of
a
coward
there
was
another
letter
of
a
much
later
date
in
a
masculine
hand
jim
horton
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
took
it
out
of
its
envelope
harry
boy
he
read
so
far
as
i
can
see
at
this
writing
the
whole
thing
has
gone
to
the
demnition
suddenly
without
a
the
money
stopped
coming
i
wrote
de
and
cabled
but
the
devil
of
a
reply
did
he
give
so
i
m
coming
to
paris
with
moira
at
once
and
it
looks
as
though
we
d
have
to
put
the
screws
on
but
i
d
be
feeling
better
if
the
papers
were
all
and
bristol
fashion
you
ll
have
to
help
maybe
the
uniform
will
turn
the
odd
trick
if
it
don
t
we
ll
find
some
way
i
feel
guilty
as
hell
about
moira
if
you
ever
make
her
unhappy
i
ll
have
the
blood
of
your
heart
but
i
m
hoping
that
the
love
will
come
if
you
play
the
game
straight
with
her
meanwhile
we
ll
feather
the
nest
if
we
can
he
s
got
to
come
there
s
some
agency
working
against
i
ve
got
to
be
on
the
scene
to
moira
got
some
portraits
to
do
or
we
wouldn
t
have
had
the
wherewithal
for
the
passage
as
it
is
i
ll
be
having
to
make
the
move
with
considerable
skill
leaving
some
obligations
behind
but
it
can
t
be
helped
and
moira
won
t
know
the
world
is
but
a
poor
place
for
the
man
who
doesn
t
make
it
give
him
a
living
mine
has
been
wretched
enough
god
knows
and
the
whisky
one
buys
over
the
bar
in
new
york
is
an
insult
to
an
irishman
s
intelligence
to
say
nothing
of
being
a
plague
upon
his
vitals
enough
of
this
come
to
the
rue
de
tavennes
no
in
your
next
furlough
and
we
ll
make
a
move
by
that
time
i
ll
have
a
plan
moira
sends
her
love
yours
very
faithfully
barry
quinlevin
there
was
a
pretty
squall
brewing
over
the
stamford
affair
but
i
reefed
sail
and
weathered
it
so
you
can
sleep
in
peace
b
q
jim
horton
lay
for
a
while
thinking
and
then
read
the
two
letters
again
the
masculine
correspondent
was
the
girl
s
father
barry
quinlevin
it
seemed
was
a
scoundrel
of
the
girl
adored
him
many
of
the
passages
in
the
letter
were
mystifying
who
was
de
and
what
was
harry
s
connection
with
this
affair
it
was
none
of
jim
horton
s
business
but
in
spite
of
himself
he
began
feeling
an
intense
sympathy
for
the
girl
moira
who
was
wrapped
in
the
coils
of
what
seemed
on
its
face
to
be
an
ugly
intrigue
if
it
wasn
t
something
worse
strange
name
quinlevin
it
was
moira
s
name
too
irish
the
phrase
about
having
harry
s
heart
s
blood
showed
that
barry
quinlevin
wasn
t
beyond
compunctions
about
the
girl
but
why
had
he
connived
at
this
loveless
marriage
there
must
have
been
a
reason
for
that
jim
morton
put
the
letters
in
the
drawer
and
gave
the
problem
up
it
wasn
t
his
business
whom
harry
had
married
or
why
the
main
thing
was
to
get
well
and
out
of
the
hospital
so
that
he
could
find
his
brother
and
set
the
tangle
straight
he
couldn
t
imagine
just
how
the
substitution
was
to
be
accomplished
but
if
harry
had
played
the
game
there
was
a
chance
that
it
might
yet
be
done
he
didn
t
want
harry
s
job
and
he
silently
cursed
himself
for
the
unfortunate
impetuous
moment
that
had
brought
about
all
the
trouble
but
how
had
he
known
that
he
was
going
to
be
hit
if
he
had
only
succeeded
in
getting
back
to
the
spot
where
harry
was
waiting
for
him
no
one
would
ever
have
been
the
wiser
no
one
knew
now
but
of
course
the
masquerade
couldn
t
last
forever
the
situation
was
impossible
meanwhile
what
was
harry
doing
had
he
succeeded
in
playing
out
the
game
during
jim
horton
s
sickness
or
had
he
found
himself
in
a
tight
place
and
quit
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
horton
shivered
slightly
desertion
flight
ignominy
disgrace
and
it
wasn
t
harry
horton
s
good
name
that
would
be
in
question
but
his
own
that
of
jim
horton
corporal
of
engineers
as
a
name
it
didn
t
stand
for
much
yet
even
out
in
kansas
city
but
he
had
never
done
anything
to
dishonor
it
and
he
didn
t
want
the
few
friends
he
had
to
think
of
him
as
a
quitter
nobody
had
ever
accused
him
of
being
that
what
a
fool
he
had
been
to
take
such
a
chance
for
a
man
like
harry
in
the
midst
of
these
troublesome
meditations
he
was
aware
of
nurse
newberry
approaching
from
the
end
of
the
ward
following
her
were
two
people
who
stopped
at
his
bed
a
man
and
a
girl
the
man
was
strong
with
grizzled
hair
a
bobbed
imperial
and
a
waxed
mustache
the
girl
had
black
hair
and
eyes
and
even
as
jim
horton
stared
at
them
he
was
aware
of
the
man
confidently
approaching
and
taking
his
hand
well
harry
don
t
you
know
me
a
voice
said
rather
hazy
eh
i
don
t
wonder
who
the
devil
were
these
people
there
must
be
a
mistake
jim
horton
mumbled
something
the
visitor
s
eyes
were
very
dark
brown
shot
with
tiny
streaks
of
yellow
and
he
looked
like
an
amiable
satyr
i
ve
brought
ye
d
like
to
see
her
the
patient
recovered
himself
he
had
forgotten
the
lapse
of
time
since
the
letters
had
been
written
moira
he
muttered
the
girl
advanced
slowly
as
the
man
made
place
her
expression
had
been
serious
but
as
she
came
forward
she
smiled
softly
harry
she
was
whispering
as
he
stared
at
her
loveliness
don
t
you
know
me
moira
he
muttered
weakly
i
m
but
his
hands
made
no
movement
toward
her
and
a
warm
flush
spread
over
the
part
of
his
face
that
was
visible
you
ve
been
very
sick
harry
but
we
came
as
soon
as
they
d
let
us
and
you
re
going
to
get
well
thank
the
holy
virgin
and
i
m
the
words
stuck
in
jim
horton
s
throat
and
he
couldn
t
utter
them
you
re
not
what
she
questioned
anxiously
another
pause
of
uncertainty
m
strong
yet
he
muttered
weakly
turning
his
head
to
one
side
and
as
he
said
it
he
knew
that
in
sheer
weakness
of
fiber
spiritual
as
well
as
physical
he
had
made
a
decision
the
satyr
behind
her
laughed
softly
naturally
he
said
but
ye
re
going
to
be
well
very
soon
they
were
both
looking
at
him
and
something
seemed
to
be
required
of
him
so
with
an
effort
how
long
have
you
been
in
france
he
asked
only
three
weeks
said
quinlevin
watching
the
bulletins
daily
for
news
of
you
i
found
out
a
week
ago
but
they
wouldn
t
let
us
in
until
and
we
can
stay
only
five
minutes
then
moira
spoke
again
with
a
different
note
in
her
voice
are
you
glad
that
i
came
she
asked
it
was
the
least
i
could
do
glad
the
word
seemed
sufficient
jim
horton
seemed
glad
to
utter
it
if
she
would
only
recognize
the
imposture
and
relieve
him
of
the
terrible
moment
of
confession
but
she
didn
t
she
had
accepted
him
as
quinlevin
as
all
the
others
had
done
for
his
face
value
without
a
sign
of
doubt
and
barry
quinlevin
stood
beaming
upon
them
both
his
bright
eyes
snapping
benevolence
if
ye
get
the
harry
boy
she
ll
sure
be
worshiping
ye
jim
horton
s
gaze
fixed
as
though
fascinated
upon
the
quiet
eyes
saw
them
close
for
a
moment
in
trouble
while
a
quick
little
frown
puckered
the
white
forehead
and
when
she
spoke
again
her
voice
uttered
the
truth
that
was
in
her
heart
one
can
not
deny
valor
she
said
coolly
it
is
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
she
wanted
no
misunderstandings
she
only
wanted
harry
horton
to
know
that
love
was
not
for
her
or
for
him
the
fakir
under
the
bed
clothes
understood
she
preferred
to
speak
of
valor
valor
if
she
only
knew
jim
horton
gathered
courage
if
he
wasn
t
to
tell
the
truth
he
would
have
to
play
his
part
everybody
is
there
he
said
with
a
gesture
but
not
brave
enough
for
mention
said
quinlevin
genially
it
won
t
do
harry
boy
a
hero
ye
were
and
a
hero
ye
ll
remain
horton
felt
the
girl
s
calm
gaze
upon
his
face
i
m
so
glad
you
ve
made
good
harry
i
am
and
i
want
you
to
believe
it
thanks
he
muttered
why
did
she
gaze
at
him
so
steadily
it
almost
seemed
as
though
she
had
read
his
secret
he
hoped
that
she
had
it
would
have
simplified
things
enormously
but
she
turned
away
with
a
smile
you
re
to
come
to
us
of
course
as
soon
as
they
let
you
out
she
said
quietly
well
rather
laughed
quinlevin
the
nurse
had
approached
and
the
girl
moira
had
moved
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
barry
quinlevin
paused
a
moment
putting
a
slip
of
paper
in
horton
s
hand
well
old
lad
in
a
few
days
the
wounded
man
s
gaze
followed
the
girl
she
smiled
back
once
at
him
and
then
followed
the
nurse
down
the
ward
jim
horton
sank
back
into
his
pillows
with
a
gasp
you
ve
done
it
now
you
gone
and
done
it
he
muttered
mystery
in
a
courageous
moment
a
day
or
so
later
the
patient
requested
nurse
newberry
to
try
to
get
what
information
she
could
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
his
cousin
corporal
james
horton
b
company
engineers
and
waited
with
some
impatience
and
anxiety
the
result
of
her
inquiries
she
discovered
that
corporal
james
horton
had
been
last
seen
in
the
fight
for
boissi√®re
wood
but
was
now
reported
as
missing
missing
the
blank
expression
on
the
face
of
her
patient
was
rather
pitiful
it
probably
means
that
he
s
a
prisoner
he
may
be
all
right
is
pretty
with
its
information
but
the
patient
knew
that
corporal
horton
wasn
t
a
prisoner
if
he
was
missing
it
was
because
he
had
gone
to
the
less
than
a
deserter
nevertheless
the
information
even
indefinite
as
it
was
brought
him
comfort
he
clung
rather
greedily
to
its
very
indefiniteness
in
the
eyes
of
the
army
or
of
the
world
missing
meant
dead
or
prisoner
and
until
harry
revealed
himself
the
good
name
of
the
corporal
of
engineers
was
safe
that
was
something
and
the
information
brought
the
wounded
man
abruptly
to
the
point
of
realizing
that
he
was
now
definitely
committed
to
play
the
role
he
had
unwittingly
chosen
he
had
done
his
best
to
explain
but
they
hadn
t
listened
to
him
and
when
confronted
with
the
only
witnesses
whose
opinions
seemed
to
matter
always
excepting
harry
himself
he
had
miserably
failed
in
carrying
out
his
first
intentions
he
tried
to
think
of
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
but
he
found
himself
confronted
with
possibilities
which
were
far
from
amusing
the
irish
eyes
of
harry
s
haunted
him
they
were
eyes
meant
to
be
tender
and
yet
were
not
her
fine
lips
were
meant
for
the
full
throated
laughter
of
happiness
and
yet
had
only
wreathed
in
faint
uncertain
smiles
barry
quinlevin
was
a
less
agreeable
figure
to
contemplate
if
jim
horton
hadn
t
read
his
letter
to
harry
he
would
have
found
it
easier
to
be
beguiled
by
the
man
s
genial
air
of
good
fellowship
and
sympathy
but
he
couldn
t
forget
the
incautious
phrases
of
that
communication
and
having
first
formed
an
unfavorable
impression
found
no
desire
to
correct
it
to
his
surprise
it
was
moira
who
came
the
following
week
to
the
hospital
at
neuilly
on
visitors
day
jim
horton
had
decided
on
a
course
of
action
but
when
she
approached
his
bed
all
redolent
with
the
joy
of
out
of
doors
he
quite
forgot
what
he
meant
to
say
to
her
in
moira
too
he
seemed
to
feel
an
effort
to
do
her
duty
to
him
with
a
good
grace
which
almost
if
not
quite
effaced
the
impression
of
her
earlier
visit
she
took
his
thin
hand
in
her
own
for
a
moment
while
she
examined
him
with
a
kindly
interest
which
he
repaid
with
a
fraternal
smile
father
sent
me
in
his
place
she
said
i
ve
put
him
to
bed
with
a
cold
i
m
so
said
horton
and
then
stopped
with
a
short
laugh
i
m
glad
you
re
here
i
m
sorry
he
s
ill
nothing
serious
oh
no
he
s
a
bit
run
down
that
s
all
and
re
feeling
better
he
liked
the
soft
way
she
slithered
over
the
last
syllable
oh
course
all
the
while
he
felt
her
level
gaze
upon
him
cool
and
intensely
serious
you
are
out
of
danger
entirely
they
tell
me
i
see
they
ve
taken
the
bandage
off
yesterday
he
said
i
m
coming
along
very
fast
i
m
glad
they
promise
before
long
that
i
can
get
out
into
the
air
in
a
that
will
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
in
spite
of
himself
he
knew
that
his
eyes
were
regarding
her
too
intently
noting
the
well
modeled
nose
the
short
upper
lip
firm
red
mouth
and
resolute
chin
all
tempered
with
the
softness
of
youth
and
exquisite
femininity
he
saw
her
chin
lowered
slightly
as
her
gaze
dropped
and
turned
aside
while
the
slightest
possible
compression
of
her
lips
indicated
a
thought
in
which
he
could
have
no
share
i
have
brought
you
some
roses
she
said
quietly
they
are
very
beautiful
they
will
remind
me
of
you
until
you
come
again
the
sudden
raising
of
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
over
the
blossoms
was
something
of
a
revelation
for
they
smiled
at
him
with
splendid
directness
you
improving
she
laughed
or
you
ve
a
blarney
stone
under
the
pillow
i
can
t
remember
when
you
ve
said
anything
so
nice
as
that
at
all
he
was
thoughtful
for
a
moment
perhaps
i
have
a
new
vision
he
said
at
last
the
bullet
in
my
head
may
have
helped
it
has
probably
affected
my
optic
nerve
she
smiled
with
him
you
really
do
seem
different
somehow
she
broke
in
i
can
t
exactly
explain
it
perhaps
it
s
the
pallor
that
makes
the
eyes
look
dark
and
your
s
he
muttered
uncomfortably
his
gaze
on
the
gray
blanket
well
you
see
i
suppose
it
s
what
i
ve
been
through
my
eyes
seem
darker
wouldn
t
they
against
white
and
then
my
isn
t
very
strong
yet
yes
that
s
it
she
replied
her
eyes
daunted
him
from
his
purpose
a
little
and
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
use
extreme
caution
but
he
had
resolved
whatever
came
to
see
the
game
through
after
all
if
she
discovered
his
secret
it
was
only
what
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
tell
her
i
m
sure
of
it
he
went
on
when
a
fellow
comes
as
near
death
as
i
ve
been
it
makes
him
different
i
seem
to
think
in
a
new
way
about
a
lot
of
for
instance
he
fancied
that
there
was
a
hard
note
in
her
voice
a
little
toss
scarcely
perceptible
of
the
rounded
chin
yes
you
see
you
oughtn
t
ever
to
have
married
me
you
re
too
good
for
me
i
m
just
a
plain
rotter
and
what
s
the
use
he
paused
hoping
that
she
would
speak
she
did
after
a
silence
and
a
shrug
father
wanted
it
it
was
one
way
of
paying
what
he
owed
you
i
don
t
know
how
much
that
was
but
i
m
still
thinking
i
went
pretty
cheap
she
halted
abruptly
and
then
went
on
coolly
i
didn
t
come
here
to
be
thinking
unpleasant
to
be
uttering
them
so
long
as
we
understand
each
we
do
he
put
in
eagerly
almost
appealingly
i
want
you
to
believe
that
i
have
no
claim
upon
relations
with
barry
quinlevin
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
and
if
i
fell
in
love
with
another
that
never
seems
to
have
occurred
to
either
of
he
laughed
her
soberness
aside
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
divorce
or
suicide
i
ll
leave
the
choice
to
you
he
gained
his
purpose
which
was
to
bring
the
smile
to
her
lips
again
your
wounds
have
inoculated
you
with
a
sense
of
humor
at
any
rate
she
said
fingering
the
roses
you
ve
always
been
lacking
in
that
you
know
i
feel
that
i
can
laugh
at
them
now
but
it
might
have
been
better
for
you
if
i
hadn
t
come
out
of
the
ether
no
i
don
t
like
your
saying
that
i
haven
t
the
slightest
intention
of
falling
in
love
with
any
man
at
all
i
shan
t
be
wanting
to
she
added
coloring
a
little
i
ve
begun
my
work
it
needed
paris
again
and
i
m
going
to
succeed
you
ll
see
i
haven
t
a
doubt
of
it
you
were
made
for
for
happiness
sure
and
i
think
that
i
that
you
mention
it
she
put
in
quaintly
i
won
t
bother
you
you
can
be
certain
of
that
he
finished
positively
and
then
cautiously
things
have
not
gone
i
mean
no
and
of
course
father
s
worried
about
it
our
income
from
ireland
has
stopped
about
repairs
he
says
but
then
i
suppose
we
will
get
it
again
some
day
dad
never
did
tell
me
anything
you
know
horton
thought
for
a
moment
he
doesn
t
want
to
worry
you
of
course
and
you
oughtn
t
to
be
worried
things
will
come
out
all
right
i
intend
that
they
shall
father
always
gave
me
the
best
when
he
had
it
i
ll
see
that
he
doesn
t
suffer
now
but
that
s
my
job
moira
we
ll
get
some
money
i
get
out
thanks
but
i
m
hoping
to
do
a
lot
of
painting
i
ve
got
one
portrait
to
begin
it
doesn
t
cost
much
in
the
quartier
horton
sat
up
in
bed
and
looked
out
of
the
window
i
ll
get
money
he
said
don
t
you
worry
he
saw
her
eyes
studying
him
quietly
and
he
sank
back
at
once
in
bed
out
of
the
glare
of
the
sunlight
he
wondered
if
he
had
gone
too
far
but
he
had
found
out
one
of
the
things
that
he
had
wanted
to
know
she
knew
nothing
of
what
barry
quinlevin
was
doing
her
next
remark
was
disquieting
it
s
very
strange
the
way
i
m
thinking
about
you
you
ve
grown
different
in
the
is
it
the
sickness
there
s
a
sweeter
look
to
your
mouth
and
a
firmer
turn
to
your
jaw
your
gaze
is
wider
and
your
heart
has
grown
soft
with
the
suffering
it
s
like
another
man
i
m
seeing
somehow
harry
and
i
m
glad
perhaps
he
muttered
she
leaned
forward
impulsively
and
put
her
hand
over
his
smiling
brightly
at
him
we
ll
be
good
friends
now
alanah
i
m
sure
of
it
you
like
me
a
little
sure
and
i
wouldn
t
be
sitting
here
holding
hands
if
i
didn
t
she
laughed
then
with
a
quick
glance
at
her
wrist
watch
she
rose
and
now
i
must
be
going
back
to
father
here
is
the
nurse
time
is
up
you
will
come
soon
again
he
asked
slowly
better
news
i
hope
revoir
mon
and
she
was
gone
the
visit
gave
him
more
food
for
thought
but
he
hadn
t
learned
much
what
he
did
know
now
was
that
the
girl
moira
trusted
barry
quinlevin
implicitly
and
that
he
had
managed
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
as
to
the
real
sources
of
his
livelihood
the
irish
rents
had
failed
to
reach
them
were
there
any
irish
rents
and
if
so
what
had
de
v
to
do
with
them
he
took
quinlevin
s
letter
from
under
the
pillow
and
it
carefully
nothing
about
irish
rents
there
perhaps
other
letters
had
followed
that
harry
had
destroyed
in
any
case
he
would
have
to
play
the
game
carefully
with
the
girl
s
father
or
quinlevin
would
find
him
out
before
horton
discovered
what
he
wanted
to
know
the
quiet
eyes
of
the
girl
moira
disturbed
him
her
eyes
her
intuitions
were
shrewd
yet
he
had
succeeded
so
far
if
he
could
pass
muster
with
the
daughter
why
shouldn
t
he
succeed
with
the
father
the
weakness
the
failing
memory
of
a
sick
man
could
be
trusted
to
bridge
difficulties
if
there
had
only
been
a
few
more
letters
he
would
have
been
better
equipped
for
the
interview
with
barry
quinlevin
which
must
soon
follow
he
inquired
of
miss
newberry
but
she
had
given
him
everything
that
had
been
found
in
his
uniform
he
scrutinized
the
notebook
carefully
which
contained
only
an
expense
account
some
addresses
in
paris
and
a
few
military
notes
and
so
he
discarded
it
it
seemed
that
until
quinlevin
came
to
the
hospital
de
v
must
remain
one
of
the
unsolved
mysteries
of
his
versatile
brother
but
moira
s
innocence
while
it
failed
to
enlighten
him
as
to
the
mystery
made
him
more
certain
that
her
loveless
marriage
with
harry
had
something
to
do
with
the
suspected
intrigue
did
harry
love
the
girl
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
that
any
man
who
was
half
a
man
could
be
much
with
her
without
loving
her
it
wasn
t
like
harry
to
marry
any
girl
unless
he
had
something
to
gain
by
it
the
conversation
he
had
just
had
with
moira
showed
exactly
the
relationship
between
them
if
he
had
needed
any
further
evidence
than
her
letter
as
to
his
own
personal
relations
with
moira
he
found
it
necessary
to
fortify
himself
against
a
more
than
strictly
fraternal
interest
in
her
personality
she
was
extremely
agreeable
to
look
at
and
he
had
to
admit
that
her
very
presence
had
cheered
up
his
particular
part
of
the
hospital
ward
amazingly
her
quaintness
her
quiet
directness
and
her
modest
demeanor
were
inherent
characteristics
but
they
could
not
disguise
the
overflowing
vitality
and
humor
that
struggled
against
the
limitations
she
had
imposed
her
roses
which
nurse
newberry
had
arranged
in
a
bowl
by
the
bedside
were
unnecessary
reminders
of
the
giver
like
them
she
was
fragrant
pristine
and
a
the
visit
of
barry
quinlevin
was
not
long
delayed
and
jim
horton
received
him
in
his
wheel
chair
by
an
open
window
in
the
convalescent
ward
he
came
in
with
a
white
silk
handkerchief
tied
about
his
neck
but
barring
a
husky
voice
showed
no
ill
effects
of
his
indisposition
he
was
an
amiable
looking
rogue
and
if
the
shade
of
whistler
will
forgive
me
resembled
much
that
illustrious
person
in
all
the
physical
graces
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
imagine
that
barry
quinlevin
could
be
quite
as
dangerous
an
enemy
well
harry
boy
here
i
am
he
announced
throwing
open
his
coat
with
something
of
an
air
and
loosening
his
scarf
no
worse
than
the
devil
made
me
and
ye
re
well
again
they
tell
me
or
so
near
it
that
ye
re
no
longer
interesting
stronger
every
day
replied
horton
cautiously
then
we
can
have
a
talk
maybe
without
danger
of
it
breaking
the
spring
in
yer
belfry
ah
yes
i
m
a
bit
hazy
at
times
added
horton
well
when
the
fog
comes
down
say
the
word
and
i
ll
be
going
don
t
worry
i
want
to
hear
the
news
quinlevin
frowned
at
his
walking
stick
it
s
little
enough
god
knows
then
glanced
toward
the
invalid
at
the
next
window
and
lowered
his
voice
a
trifle
the
spalpeen
says
not
a
he
s
afflicted
with
for
i
ve
written
him
three
since
i
reached
paris
giving
him
the
address
so
we
ll
have
to
make
a
move
what
will
you
do
go
to
see
you
can
at
first
ye
see
i
thought
maybe
he
d
gone
away
or
died
or
something
but
i
watched
the
h√¥tel
de
vautrin
in
the
rue
de
bac
until
i
saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
that
s
how
i
took
this
the
night
air
with
devil
a
drink
within
a
mile
of
me
i
saw
him
i
tell
you
as
hale
and
hearty
as
ye
please
and
debonair
like
a
new
laid
egg
with
me
barry
quinlevin
in
the
rain
not
four
paces
from
the
carriage
way
the
visitor
paused
as
though
for
a
comment
and
horton
offered
it
he
didn
t
see
you
devil
a
one
of
me
for
the
moment
i
thought
of
bracing
him
then
and
there
but
i
didn
i
was
reduced
to
a
small
matter
of
a
hundred
francs
or
so
things
are
as
bad
as
quinlevin
shrugged
i
bettered
myself
a
bit
the
next
night
and
i
ll
find
a
he
broke
off
with
a
shrug
but
i
m
not
going
to
be
wasting
my
talents
on
the
little
in
guillaume
s
besides
twould
be
most
unpatriotic
i
m
out
for
bigger
game
me
son
that
spells
itself
in
seven
figures
nothing
less
than
a
d
will
satisfy
the
ambitions
of
barry
quinlevin
well
asked
horton
shrewdly
for
the
present
ye
re
to
stay
where
ye
are
till
yer
head
is
as
tight
as
a
drum
giving
me
the
benefit
of
yer
sage
advice
we
ll
worry
along
the
rent
of
the
apartment
and
studio
is
a
meager
two
hundred
francs
and
the
we
will
eat
enough
and
moira
has
some
work
to
do
but
we
can
t
be
letting
the
duc
forget
i
ve
ever
existed
a
man
with
a
reputation
in
jeopardy
and
twenty
millions
of
francs
you
ll
admit
is
not
to
be
found
growing
on
every
mulberry
bush
horton
nodded
it
blackmail
then
the
duc
de
you
wrote
that
you
had
a
plan
he
said
what
is
it
barry
quinlevin
waved
a
careless
hand
fair
means
as
one
gentleman
uses
to
another
if
he
explains
his
negligence
and
remits
the
small
balance
due
otherwise
we
ll
have
to
squeeze
him
a
letter
from
a
good
it
wasn
t
for
the
testimony
of
nora
burke
he
was
silent
in
a
moment
of
puzzled
retrospection
and
his
glittering
generalities
only
piqued
jim
horton
s
curiosity
so
that
his
eagerness
led
him
into
an
error
that
nearly
undid
him
nora
he
put
in
slowly
i
wrote
ye
what
i
couldn
t
have
received
the
he
stopped
abruptly
for
quinlevin
was
staring
at
him
in
astonishment
then
how
the
devil
could
ye
have
answered
it
horton
covered
the
awkward
moment
by
closing
his
eyes
and
passing
his
fingers
across
his
brow
answered
it
funny
i
don
t
remember
the
irishman
regarded
him
a
moment
soberly
and
then
smiled
in
deprecation
of
ve
slipped
a
then
suddenly
he
clapped
a
hand
on
horton
s
knee
why
man
alive
irish
nurse
who
provides
the
necessary
s
nurse
d
ye
mind
when
she
was
a
baby
who
saw
the
duc
s
child
do
ye
horton
ran
his
fingers
over
his
hair
thoughtfully
and
bent
his
head
again
nora
s
saw
the
duc
s
child
die
he
repeated
and
the
he
muttered
and
paused
thinks
his
child
by
this
early
marriage
is
still
said
quinlevin
regarding
him
dubiously
yes
yes
said
horton
eagerly
it
s
coming
back
to
me
now
and
de
vautrin
s
he
ll
pay
through
the
nose
to
keep
the
thing
barry
quinlevin
paused
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
in
which
the
visitor
frowned
out
of
the
window
i
don
t
like
the
look
of
things
i
tell
ye
harry
ye
re
in
no
fit
shape
to
help
til
the
fog
clears
up
but
i
ve
a
mind
that
somebody
s
slipped
a
finger
into
the
pie
nora
burke
wants
more
hundred
pounds
to
tell
a
straight
story
and
where
i
m
going
to
get
devil
himself
only
knows
nora
hundred
pounds
muttered
horton
vaguely
for
he
was
thinking
deeply
that
s
a
lot
of
money
ye
re
ye
haven
t
got
it
and
de
vautrin
s
shutting
down
at
the
same
time
it
looks
suspicious
i
tell
ye
he
broke
off
and
fixed
his
iridescent
gaze
on
horton
ye
re
sure
ye
said
nothing
to
any
one
in
paris
before
ye
went
to
the
front
of
this
at
least
jim
horton
was
sure
nothing
he
replied
not
to
piquette
morin
here
was
dangerous
ground
again
nothing
he
repeated
slowly
nothing
and
ye
wouldn
t
be
remembering
it
if
ye
had
said
quinlevin
peevishly
as
he
rose
oh
ll
have
to
raise
this
money
some
way
or
go
to
galway
to
put
the
gag
on
nora
burke
until
we
play
the
m
sorry
i
can
t
said
horton
but
you
m
oh
yes
i
see
said
quinlevin
more
affably
i
shouldn
t
be
bothering
ye
so
soon
but
may
the
devil
take
me
if
i
know
which
way
to
turn
will
you
see
de
vautrin
perhaps
but
i
may
go
to
ireland
first
i
ve
got
to
do
some
good
bye
ye
re
not
up
to
the
mark
be
careful
when
moira
comes
or
ye
may
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
d
ye
hear
don
t
won
t
said
horton
soberly
he
watched
the
tall
figure
of
quinlevin
until
it
disappeared
into
the
outer
hall
and
then
turned
a
frowning
gaze
out
of
the
window
jim
horton
had
had
a
narrow
escape
from
discovery
but
in
spite
of
his
precarious
position
and
the
pitfalls
that
seemed
to
lay
to
right
and
left
he
had
become
if
anything
more
determined
than
ever
to
follow
the
fate
to
which
he
had
committed
himself
there
now
seemed
no
doubt
that
moira
was
in
all
innocence
involved
in
some
way
in
the
blackmailing
scheme
which
had
been
the
main
source
of
livelihood
for
the
quinlevin
family
for
many
years
and
moira
did
not
know
for
the
duc
de
vautrin
of
course
was
the
source
of
the
irish
rents
to
which
she
had
alluded
and
now
he
was
refusing
to
pay
it
was
clear
that
something
unpleasant
hung
in
the
air
an
ill
wind
for
the
duc
de
vautrin
and
for
the
plotters
moira
s
father
and
jim
horton
s
precious
brother
and
it
seemed
quite
necessary
in
the
interests
of
honesty
that
he
jim
horton
should
remain
for
the
present
in
the
game
and
divert
if
possible
the
currents
of
evil
which
encompassed
his
interesting
one
thing
he
had
by
taking
refuge
behind
the
barriers
of
his
failing
memory
it
might
be
possible
to
keep
up
the
deception
at
least
until
he
was
out
of
the
hospital
and
a
crisis
of
some
sort
came
to
relieve
him
of
his
responsibility
indeed
there
was
something
most
agreeable
in
the
friendly
regard
of
his
brother
s
loveless
wife
and
under
other
circumstances
the
calls
of
this
charming
person
would
have
been
the
source
of
unalloyed
delight
for
as
the
days
passed
more
and
more
she
threw
off
the
restraint
of
her
earlier
visits
and
they
had
now
reached
a
relationship
of
understanding
and
most
delightful
and
unusual
in
its
informality
jim
horton
was
progressing
rapidly
and
except
for
occasional
lapses
of
memory
easily
explained
and
perfectly
understood
by
his
visitors
gained
health
and
strength
until
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
weeks
but
of
days
when
he
should
be
able
to
leave
the
hospital
and
accept
the
invitation
of
his
newly
discovered
relatives
to
visit
the
studio
apartment
he
had
made
further
efforts
through
the
hospital
authorities
to
find
some
trace
of
the
missing
man
but
without
success
and
in
default
of
any
definite
plan
of
action
chose
to
follow
the
line
of
least
resistance
until
something
should
happen
barry
quinlevin
visited
him
twice
but
spoke
little
of
the
affair
of
the
duc
de
vautrin
which
it
seemed
was
being
held
in
abeyance
for
the
moment
preferring
to
wait
until
the
brain
and
body
of
the
injured
man
could
help
him
to
plan
and
to
execute
and
jim
horton
finding
that
safety
lay
in
silence
or
fatigue
did
little
further
to
encourage
his
confidences
thus
it
was
that
after
several
weeks
he
impatiently
awaited
moira
outside
the
hospital
it
was
a
gorgeous
afternoon
of
blue
and
gold
with
the
haze
of
indian
summer
hanging
lazily
over
the
peaceful
autumn
landscape
an
aromatic
odor
of
burning
leaves
was
in
the
air
and
about
him
aged
men
and
women
worked
in
road
and
garden
as
though
the
alarms
of
war
had
never
come
to
their
ears
the
signing
of
the
armistice
which
had
taken
place
while
horton
was
still
in
his
bed
had
been
the
cause
of
much
quiet
joy
throughout
the
hospital
but
with
the
return
of
health
jim
horton
had
begun
wondering
what
effect
the
peace
was
to
have
upon
his
strange
upon
harry
s
he
knew
that
for
the
present
he
had
been
granted
a
furlough
which
he
was
to
spend
with
the
quinlevins
in
paris
but
after
that
what
was
to
happen
he
was
a
little
dubious
too
about
his
relations
with
moira
but
when
he
saw
her
coming
down
the
path
to
the
open
air
pavilion
with
nurse
newberry
all
flushed
with
the
prospect
of
carrying
him
off
in
triumph
in
the
ancient
fiacre
from
which
she
had
descended
he
could
not
deny
a
thrill
of
pleasure
that
was
not
all
fraternal
behold
she
cried
in
greeting
i
ve
come
to
take
you
prisoner
he
laughed
gayly
as
he
took
her
hand
and
there
s
a
goose
in
the
pantry
bought
at
a
fabulous
price
just
waiting
for
the
be
sure
you
don
t
kill
your
prisoner
with
kindness
put
in
nurse
newberry
i
ll
take
that
risk
said
horton
genially
sure
and
he
must
put
in
moira
it
isn
t
every
day
one
brings
a
conquering
hero
home
especially
when
he
s
your
husband
said
the
artless
miss
newberry
wistfully
jim
horton
had
a
glimpse
of
the
color
that
ran
like
a
flame
up
moira
s
throat
to
her
brow
but
he
glanced
quickly
away
and
busied
himself
with
a
buckle
at
his
belt
i
want
to
thank
you
miss
newberry
he
said
soberly
for
all
that
you
ve
done
for
me
i
ll
never
forget
nor
i
lieutenant
horton
but
you
re
in
better
hands
than
mine
now
a
week
or
so
and
you
ll
be
as
strong
as
ever
i
ve
never
felt
better
in
my
life
he
replied
they
moved
toward
the
conveyance
shook
hands
with
the
nurse
and
with
harry
s
baggage
which
had
just
been
sent
down
from
regimental
headquarters
upon
the
box
beside
the
rubicund
and
rotund
cocher
they
drove
out
of
the
gates
and
toward
the
long
finger
of
the
eiffel
tower
which
seemed
to
be
beckoning
to
them
across
the
blue
haze
above
the
roof
tops
neither
of
them
spoke
for
a
moment
in
the
ward
in
the
convalescent
rooms
or
even
in
the
grounds
of
the
hospital
moira
had
been
a
visitor
with
a
mission
of
charity
and
cheer
here
in
the
the
basis
of
their
relationship
seemed
suddenly
and
quite
mysteriously
to
change
whether
moira
felt
it
or
not
he
did
not
know
for
she
looked
out
of
her
window
at
the
passing
scene
and
her
partly
averted
profile
revealed
nothing
of
her
thoughts
but
the
fact
that
they
were
for
the
first
time
really
alone
and
driving
to
moira
s
paris
apartment
gave
him
a
qualm
of
guilt
on
account
of
the
impossible
situation
that
he
had
created
he
had
he
thought
shown
her
deep
gratitude
and
had
succeeded
in
winning
the
friendship
that
harry
had
perhaps
taken
too
much
for
granted
it
had
given
jim
horton
pleasure
to
think
that
moira
now
really
liked
him
for
himself
alone
and
the
of
her
good
fellowship
had
given
him
every
token
of
her
spirit
of
conciliation
she
had
had
her
moods
of
reserve
before
like
the
one
of
her
present
silence
but
the
abundance
of
her
vitality
and
sense
of
humor
had
responded
unconsciously
to
his
own
and
they
had
drawn
closer
with
the
artless
grace
of
two
children
thrown
upon
their
own
resources
and
now
here
in
the
ramshackle
vehicle
for
the
first
time
alone
jim
horton
would
have
very
much
liked
to
take
her
by
the
hand
which
lay
most
temptingly
upon
the
seat
beside
him
and
tell
her
the
truth
but
that
meant
harry
s
anguish
of
her
discovering
that
such
a
friendship
as
this
with
her
own
husband
could
never
be
for
in
her
eyes
jim
horton
had
seen
her
own
courage
and
a
contempt
for
all
things
that
harry
was
or
could
ever
hope
to
be
and
so
with
an
effort
he
folded
his
arms
resolutely
and
stared
out
of
his
window
it
was
then
that
her
voice
recalled
him
can
t
you
smell
that
goose
harry
dear
she
said
he
flashed
a
quick
smile
at
her
just
can
t
i
he
laughed
and
you
re
to
help
me
cook
vegetables
and
coffee
you
know
finished
nothing
ever
tastes
quite
so
good
as
when
you
cook
it
yourself
and
you
do
all
the
he
asked
thoughtfully
more
often
we
go
to
a
caf√©
sometimes
madame
toupin
helps
the
father
thinks
my
cooking
is
the
best
i
don
t
doubt
it
i
shall
too
and
then
where
is
your
father
she
looked
at
him
eyes
wide
as
though
suddenly
reminded
i
forgot
she
gasped
he
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
he
was
obliged
to
be
leaving
for
the
irish
rents
isn
t
it
tiresome
oh
said
horton
quietly
i
see
he
turned
his
thoughtful
gaze
out
of
the
carriage
window
into
the
avenue
de
neuilly
the
situation
had
its
charm
but
he
had
counted
on
the
presence
of
barry
quinlevin
how
long
will
he
be
gone
he
asked
i
don
t
know
she
replied
a
week
or
more
perhaps
but
i
ll
try
to
make
you
comfortable
i
ve
wanted
so
to
have
everything
nice
he
smiled
at
her
warmth
you
forget
i
ve
learned
to
be
a
soldier
moira
a
blanket
on
the
floor
of
the
studio
and
i
ll
be
as
happy
as
a
no
you
shall
have
the
best
that
there
very
i
don
t
propose
to
let
you
work
for
me
moira
i
can
get
some
money
i
can
find
a
somewhere
near
she
turned
toward
him
suddenly
her
eyes
very
close
to
tears
do
you
wish
to
make
me
i
ve
tried
so
hard
moira
he
caught
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
gently
i
didn
t
i
ve
wanted
so
for
you
to
forget
how
unkind
i
had
been
to
make
this
seem
like
a
real
homecoming
after
all
you
ve
been
through
and
now
to
hear
you
talking
of
going
to
a
thought
it
might
be
it
might
be
more
pleasant
for
he
broke
down
miserably
she
released
her
fingers
gently
and
turned
away
sure
alanah
and
i
think
that
i
should
be
the
judge
of
that
she
said
we
ll
say
no
more
about
it
he
muttered
but
m
very
grateful
moira
s
lips
wreathed
into
an
adorable
smile
i
ve
been
thinking
the
war
has
done
something
to
you
harry
and
now
i
m
sure
of
it
you
ve
been
learning
to
think
of
somebody
beside
yourself
i
d
be
pretty
rotten
if
i
hadn
t
learned
to
do
some
thinking
about
he
said
as
he
looked
into
her
eyes
with
more
hardihood
than
wisdom
she
met
his
gaze
for
the
fraction
of
a
minute
and
then
raised
her
chin
and
laughed
merrily
up
at
the
broad
back
of
the
cocher
yes
you
ve
changed
harry
dear
god
knows
how
or
you
ve
changed
you
ll
be
paying
me
some
compliments
upon
my
pulchritude
and
heavenly
virtues
by
and
by
why
shouldn
t
i
he
insisted
soberly
when
her
laughter
subsided
your
loveliness
is
only
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
the
inward
and
spiritual
grace
i
m
so
sure
of
it
that
i
don
t
care
whether
you
laugh
or
not
am
i
lovely
you
think
so
s
nice
to
hear
even
if
it
only
makes
conversation
also
that
my
nose
is
not
so
bad
even
if
it
does
turn
piously
to
there
s
a
deep
dent
in
my
chin
which
means
that
i
ve
got
a
bit
of
the
devil
in
cess
to
that
you
d
better
do
just
what
i
want
you
we
ll
have
a
falling
out
and
that
would
be
a
of
the
goose
he
laughed
as
gayly
as
she
had
done
i
ve
a
notion
moira
he
said
that
it
s
my
goose
you
re
going
to
cook
and
i
ve
a
notion
she
said
poising
a
slim
gloved
finger
for
a
second
upon
his
knee
i
ve
a
notion
that
we
re
both
going
to
cook
him
it
seemed
too
much
like
a
prophecy
to
be
quite
to
his
liking
her
moods
were
protean
and
her
rapid
transitions
bewildered
and
yet
under
them
all
he
realized
how
sane
she
was
how
honest
with
him
and
with
herself
and
how
free
from
any
guile
she
trusted
him
entirely
as
one
good
friend
would
trust
another
and
the
thought
of
any
evil
coming
to
her
through
his
strange
venture
into
harry
s
shoes
made
him
most
unhappy
but
her
pretty
dream
of
a
husband
with
whom
she
could
at
least
be
on
terms
of
friendship
must
some
day
come
to
an
end
and
yet
suppose
the
report
that
harry
was
missing
meant
that
he
was
dead
a
bit
of
didn
t
wish
that
chance
was
within
the
range
of
the
possible
they
had
passed
down
the
avenue
of
the
grande
arm√©e
into
the
place
de
l
√©toile
and
were
now
in
the
magnificent
reaches
of
the
champs
√©lys√©es
jim
horton
had
only
been
in
paris
for
five
hours
between
trains
little
more
than
long
enough
to
open
an
account
at
a
bank
but
moira
chattered
on
gayly
with
the
point
of
view
of
an
showing
him
the
places
which
they
must
visit
together
throwing
in
a
word
of
history
here
an
incident
or
adventure
there
giving
the
places
they
passed
the
personality
of
her
point
of
view
highly
tinged
with
the
artist
s
idealism
from
her
talk
he
gathered
that
she
had
lived
much
in
paris
during
all
her
student
days
and
except
for
the
little
corner
in
ireland
where
she
had
been
born
and
which
she
had
visited
from
time
to
time
loved
it
better
than
any
place
in
the
world
and
i
shall
teach
you
to
speak
french
real
of
the
you
shall
love
it
as
i
i
do
speak
it
a
little
already
he
ventured
really
and
who
was
your
instructress
the
dropping
intonation
was
sudden
and
very
direct
jim
horton
looked
out
of
the
window
he
was
sure
that
harry
wouldn
t
have
been
able
to
meet
her
gaze
no
one
he
muttered
at
least
no
girl
that
s
the
truth
we
had
books
and
things
oh
she
finished
dryly
her
attitude
in
this
matter
was
a
revelation
the
incident
seemed
to
clarify
their
relations
and
in
a
new
way
for
in
a
moment
she
was
conversing
again
in
a
manner
most
unconcerned
friendly
she
might
be
with
harry
for
the
sake
of
the
things
that
he
had
accomplished
companionable
and
kind
for
the
sake
of
the
things
he
had
suffered
but
as
for
any
deeper
was
another
matter
moira
was
no
fool
but
at
least
she
trusted
him
now
she
dared
to
trust
him
otherwise
why
did
she
conduct
him
with
such
an
air
of
unconcern
to
the
apartment
in
the
rue
de
tavennes
but
he
couldn
t
be
unaware
of
the
alertness
in
her
unconcern
an
occasional
quick
and
furtive
side
glance
which
showed
that
however
friendly
she
was
still
on
her
guard
perhaps
she
wanted
to
study
this
harry
at
closer
range
but
why
had
she
chosen
the
venture
he
had
given
her
her
chance
why
had
she
refused
to
take
it
the
answers
to
these
questions
were
still
puzzling
him
when
they
drove
up
the
hill
by
the
boulevard
she
called
the
luxembourg
gardens
and
then
turning
into
a
smaller
street
were
presently
deposited
at
their
her
air
of
gayety
was
infectious
and
she
presented
him
to
the
good
madame
toupin
who
came
out
to
meet
them
with
the
air
of
one
greeting
an
ambassador
welcome
le
madame
horton
has
promised
us
this
visit
since
a
long
time
enter
house
is
honored
thank
the
for
the
americans
jim
horton
bowed
and
followed
moira
into
the
small
court
and
up
the
stairway
experiencing
a
new
sense
of
guilt
at
having
his
name
coupled
so
familiarly
with
moira
s
harry
s
name
and
yet
the
circumstances
of
the
marriage
were
so
strange
the
facts
as
to
her
actual
relations
with
her
husband
so
patent
that
he
found
himself
resenting
moira
s
placid
acceptance
of
the
appellation
there
was
something
back
of
it
all
that
he
did
not
know
but
moira
gave
him
no
time
to
think
of
the
matter
conducting
him
into
the
large
studio
and
showing
him
through
the
bedroom
and
kitchen
where
she
proudly
exhibited
her
goose
and
jim
horton
s
that
she
was
to
cook
and
after
he
had
deposited
his
luggage
in
a
room
nearby
which
he
was
to
occupy
she
removed
her
gloves
in
a
manner
took
off
her
hat
and
coat
and
invited
him
into
the
kitchen
monsieur
she
said
gayly
in
french
as
she
rolled
up
her
sleeves
we
shall
now
cook
a
goose
in
this
modern
apparatus
so
kindly
furnished
by
the
de
there
s
a
large
knife
in
the
drawer
you
will
now
help
me
to
cut
up
the
the
carrots
which
we
shall
stew
then
some
lettuce
and
a
beautiful
dessert
from
the
a
what
more
can
the
soul
of
man
desire
he
replied
with
a
triumphant
grin
of
understanding
from
behind
the
dish
pan
ah
you
do
understand
she
cried
in
english
was
she
a
or
dark
with
or
if
she
was
harry
i
ll
be
scratching
her
eyes
out
no
he
shook
his
head
and
laughed
she
was
black
and
white
and
her
name
was
ollendorff
you
ll
still
persist
in
that
deception
i
do
you
re
almost
too
proficient
you
had
better
not
try
me
too
far
she
smiled
brightly
at
him
over
the
fowl
which
she
was
getting
ready
for
the
pan
stuffing
it
with
a
dressing
already
prepared
i
wonder
how
far
i
might
be
trying
you
harry
dear
she
said
mischievously
he
glanced
at
her
i
don
t
know
he
said
quietly
but
i
think
i
ve
learned
something
of
the
meaning
of
patience
in
the
army
then
god
be
praised
she
ejaculated
with
air
of
piety
putting
the
fowl
into
the
pan
here
cut
slice
to
your
heart
s
content
but
spare
your
fingers
she
sat
him
in
a
chair
and
saw
him
begin
while
she
prepared
the
salad
patience
is
by
way
of
being
a
virtue
she
resumed
quizzically
her
pink
fingers
weaving
among
the
and
then
so
they
taught
you
that
in
the
army
they
did
and
did
you
never
get
tired
of
being
patient
harry
dear
he
met
the
issue
squarely
you
may
try
me
as
far
as
you
like
moira
he
said
quietly
i
owe
you
that
she
hadn
t
bargained
for
such
a
counter
oh
she
muttered
and
diligently
examined
a
doubtful
lettuce
leaf
by
the
fading
light
of
the
small
window
while
horton
sliced
scrupulously
at
his
potato
and
when
the
goose
was
safely
over
the
flame
she
quickly
disappeared
into
the
studio
he
couldn
t
make
her
out
it
seemed
that
a
devil
was
in
her
a
mischievous
beautiful
tantalizing
little
irish
bent
on
psychological
investigation
also
he
had
never
before
seen
her
with
her
hat
off
and
he
discovered
that
he
liked
her
hair
it
had
bluish
tints
that
precisely
matched
her
eyes
he
finished
his
last
potato
with
meticulous
diligence
and
then
quickly
rose
and
followed
her
into
the
studio
where
a
transformation
had
already
taken
place
a
table
over
which
a
white
cloth
had
been
thrown
had
been
drawn
out
near
the
big
easel
and
upon
it
were
plates
glasses
knives
and
forks
and
candles
with
shades
and
there
was
even
a
bowl
of
flowers
in
the
hearth
fagots
were
crackling
and
warmed
the
cool
shadows
from
the
big
north
light
already
violet
with
the
falling
dusk
are
now
is
it
not
pleasant
it
was
and
he
said
so
you
like
my
studio
it
s
great
and
the
i
see
doesn
t
sent
le
french
dowager
who
braved
the
fokkers
when
all
her
family
were
in
terror
she
deserves
immortality
and
you
not
afraid
of
the
bombardments
after
all
the
trouble
we
had
getting
she
broke
off
suddenly
and
catching
him
by
the
hand
dashed
for
the
kitchen
whence
came
an
appetizing
the
goose
we
ve
forgotten
the
goose
she
cried
and
proceeded
to
baste
it
skillfully
she
commended
his
potatoes
and
bade
him
stir
them
in
the
pan
while
she
made
the
salad
oil
a
little
vinegar
paprika
salt
in
a
bowl
with
a
piece
of
ice
at
the
end
of
a
fork
he
watched
her
curiously
with
the
eyes
of
inexperience
as
she
brought
all
the
various
operations
neatly
to
a
focus
it
is
done
she
said
french
go
thou
and
sit
at
the
table
and
i
will
serve
but
he
wouldn
t
do
that
and
helped
her
to
dish
the
dinner
bringing
it
in
and
placing
it
on
the
table
and
at
last
they
were
seated
horton
with
his
back
to
the
fire
the
glow
of
which
played
a
pretty
game
of
hide
and
seek
with
the
shadows
of
her
face
he
let
her
carve
the
goose
and
she
did
it
skillfully
while
he
served
the
vegetables
they
ate
and
drank
to
each
other
in
which
was
all
that
moira
could
the
prodigal
expenditure
for
the
de
moira
her
face
a
little
flushed
talked
gayly
while
the
spurious
husband
opposite
sat
watching
her
and
grinning
comfortably
he
couldn
t
remember
when
he
had
been
quite
so
happy
in
his
life
or
quite
so
and
so
he
fell
silent
after
a
while
every
impulse
urging
confession
and
yet
not
daring
it
illustration
moira
talked
gayly
they
took
their
coffee
by
the
embers
of
the
fire
the
light
from
the
great
north
window
had
long
since
expired
and
the
mellow
glow
of
the
candles
flickered
softly
on
polished
surfaces
suddenly
moira
stopped
talking
and
realized
that
as
she
did
so
silence
had
fallen
her
companion
had
sunk
deep
into
his
chair
his
gaze
on
the
gallery
above
a
frown
tangling
his
forehead
she
glanced
at
him
quickly
and
then
looked
away
something
was
required
of
him
and
so
why
have
you
done
all
this
for
me
he
asked
gently
she
smiled
and
their
glances
met
because
you
thought
it
a
duty
easily
it
wasn
t
really
that
duty
is
such
a
tiresome
word
to
do
one
s
duty
is
to
do
something
one
does
not
want
to
do
don
t
i
seem
to
be
having
a
good
time
i
hope
you
are
i
m
not
likely
to
forget
your
charity
i
don
t
like
that
word
it
charity
moira
i
don
t
deserve
it
the
words
were
casual
but
they
seemed
to
illumine
the
path
ahead
for
she
broke
out
impetuously
i
didn
t
think
you
pitied
what
you
had
been
and
almost
if
not
quite
loathed
you
for
the
hold
you
seemed
to
have
on
father
i
don
t
know
what
the
secret
was
or
how
much
he
owed
you
but
i
know
that
he
was
miserable
i
think
i
must
have
been
hating
you
a
great
deal
harry
yet
i
married
you
why
did
you
he
muttered
i
had
no
right
to
a
war
marriage
god
knows
she
said
with
a
quick
gasp
as
she
bowed
her
head
you
had
made
good
at
the
camp
i
think
it
was
the
regimental
band
at
yaphank
that
brought
me
around
and
then
you
seemed
so
pathetic
and
wishful
i
got
to
thinking
you
might
be
killed
father
wanted
it
and
she
paused
and
sighed
deeply
did
it
it
was
the
most
that
i
could
liberty
she
raised
her
head
proudly
and
stared
into
the
glowing
embers
for
gave
your
own
he
murmured
it
was
she
broke
in
again
a
horrible
sacrilege
i
did
not
love
could
not
honor
had
no
intention
of
obeying
you
she
stopped
suddenly
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
he
thought
that
she
was
in
tears
but
he
did
not
dare
to
touch
her
though
he
leaned
toward
her
his
fingers
groping
presently
she
took
her
hands
down
and
threw
them
out
in
a
wild
gesture
it
is
i
am
saying
to
you
let
loose
the
floodgates
and
i
had
to
speak
he
leaned
closer
and
laid
his
fingers
over
hers
it
was
a
he
said
i
would
do
anything
to
repair
it
he
meant
what
he
said
and
the
deep
tones
of
his
voice
vibrated
close
to
her
ear
she
did
not
turn
to
look
at
him
and
kept
her
gaze
on
the
fire
but
she
breathed
uneasily
and
then
closed
her
eyes
a
moment
as
though
in
deep
thought
don
t
you
believe
me
moira
she
glanced
at
him
and
then
leaned
forward
the
fire
i
believe
that
i
do
she
replied
slowly
i
don
t
know
why
it
is
that
i
should
be
thinking
so
differently
about
you
but
i
do
you
see
if
i
hadn
t
trusted
you
we
d
never
have
been
sitting
here
this
night
i
gave
you
your
chance
to
be
yes
you
did
that
but
i
couldn
t
let
you
be
going
to
a
harry
i
think
it
was
the
pity
for
your
pale
face
against
the
pillows
nothing
else
he
asked
quietly
his
hand
had
taken
the
fingers
on
the
chair
arm
and
she
did
not
withdraw
them
at
once
sure
and
maybe
it
was
the
blarney
i
ve
meant
what
i
ve
said
he
whispered
in
spite
of
himself
you
re
the
loveliest
girl
in
all
the
world
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
in
which
her
hand
fluttered
uneasily
in
his
while
a
gentle
color
came
into
her
face
then
abruptly
she
withdrew
her
fingers
and
sprang
up
her
face
aflame
go
along
with
you
you
ll
be
making
love
to
me
next
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
silent
perturbed
as
he
realized
that
this
was
just
what
was
in
his
heart
come
she
laughed
we
ve
got
all
the
dishes
to
and
then
you
re
to
be
getting
to
bed
or
your
head
will
be
aching
in
the
morning
she
brought
him
to
himself
with
the
clear
cool
note
of
and
with
a
short
laugh
and
a
shrug
which
hid
a
complexity
of
feeling
he
followed
her
into
the
kitchen
with
the
dishes
but
a
restraint
had
fallen
between
them
moira
worked
with
a
air
rather
overdoing
it
and
jim
horton
sure
that
he
was
a
blackguard
of
sorts
wiped
the
dishes
she
handed
to
him
and
then
obediently
followed
her
to
the
room
off
the
hall
where
his
baggage
had
been
carried
she
put
the
candle
on
the
table
and
gave
him
her
frankest
smile
sleep
sound
my
dear
for
i
ll
be
showing
you
the
sights
moira
he
said
gently
and
she
was
gone
he
stood
staring
at
the
closed
door
aware
of
the
sharp
click
of
the
latch
and
the
faint
firm
tap
of
her
high
heels
diminishing
along
the
the
closing
of
the
studio
door
for
a
long
while
he
stood
there
not
moving
and
then
mechanically
took
out
a
cigarette
tapping
it
against
the
back
of
his
hand
only
the
urge
of
a
light
for
his
cigarette
from
the
candle
at
last
made
him
turn
away
then
he
sank
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
smoked
for
awhile
his
brows
furrowed
in
thought
nothing
that
harry
had
ever
done
seemed
more
despicable
than
the
part
that
he
had
chosen
to
play
he
was
winning
her
friendship
her
esteem
something
even
finer
than
these
harry
borrowing
from
their
tragic
marriage
the
right
to
this
strange
intimacy
if
her
dislike
of
him
had
only
continued
if
she
had
tolerated
him
even
or
if
she
had
been
other
than
she
was
his
path
would
have
been
smoother
but
she
was
making
it
very
difficult
for
him
he
paced
the
floor
again
for
awhile
until
his
cigarette
burnt
his
fingers
then
he
walked
to
the
window
opened
it
and
looked
out
it
was
early
eleven
o
clock
the
thought
of
sleep
annoyed
him
so
he
took
up
his
cap
blew
out
the
candle
and
went
quietly
out
into
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
he
wanted
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
away
from
the
associations
of
the
studio
to
assume
his
true
guise
as
an
alien
and
an
enemy
to
this
girl
who
had
learned
to
trust
him
the
cool
air
of
the
seemed
to
clear
his
thoughts
in
all
all
decency
he
must
discover
some
way
of
finding
his
brother
harry
expose
the
ugly
intrigue
and
then
take
harry
s
place
and
go
out
into
the
darkness
of
ignominy
and
disgrace
that
would
require
some
courage
he
could
see
more
than
it
had
taken
to
go
out
against
the
boche
machine
gunners
in
the
darkness
of
boissi√®re
wood
but
there
didn
t
seem
to
be
anything
else
to
do
if
he
wanted
to
preserve
his
own
but
of
what
value
was
to
a
man
publicly
disgraced
and
unless
he
could
devise
some
miracle
that
would
enable
him
to
come
back
from
the
dead
a
miracle
that
would
stand
the
test
of
a
rigid
army
investigation
the
penalty
of
his
action
was
at
the
least
a
long
term
of
imprisonment
in
a
federal
prison
from
which
he
would
emerge
a
broken
and
ruined
man
of
middle
age
this
alternative
was
not
cheering
and
yet
he
faced
it
bravely
he
would
have
to
find
harry
the
feat
was
not
difficult
for
as
he
emerged
from
the
gate
of
the
of
the
and
turned
thoughtfully
down
the
darkened
street
outside
a
man
in
a
battered
slouch
hat
and
civilian
clothes
approached
from
the
angle
of
a
wall
and
faced
him
what
the
are
you
doing
at
no
rue
de
tavennes
said
a
voice
gruffly
jim
horton
started
back
at
the
sound
now
aware
that
fortune
had
presented
him
with
his
alternative
for
the
man
in
the
slouch
hat
was
his
brother
harry
when
jim
horton
corporal
of
engineers
took
his
twin
brother
s
uniform
and
moved
off
into
the
darkness
toward
the
german
lines
harry
horton
remained
as
his
brother
had
left
him
bewildered
angry
and
still
very
much
afraid
the
idea
of
taking
jim
horton
s
place
with
his
squad
nearby
did
not
appeal
to
him
the
danger
of
discovery
was
too
soon
perhaps
the
squad
would
have
to
advance
into
the
dreadful
curtain
of
black
that
would
spout
fire
and
death
he
was
fed
up
with
it
the
baptism
of
fire
in
the
afternoon
had
shaken
him
when
they
lay
in
the
field
it
was
the
grinning
head
of
levinski
of
the
fourth
squad
that
had
done
the
business
he
had
found
it
staring
at
him
in
the
wheat
as
the
platoon
crawled
forward
it
wasn
t
so
much
that
it
was
an
isolated
head
as
that
it
was
the
isolated
head
of
levinski
for
he
hadn
t
liked
levinski
and
he
knew
that
the
man
had
hated
him
and
now
levinski
had
had
his
revenge
harry
had
been
deathly
ill
at
the
stomach
and
had
not
gone
forward
with
the
platoon
he
had
seen
the
whites
of
the
eyes
of
his
men
as
they
had
glanced
aside
at
spat
why
the
he
had
ever
gone
into
the
thing
and
now
suppose
jim
didn
t
come
back
what
should
he
do
why
had
the
major
picked
him
out
for
this
duty
his
thoughts
wandered
wildly
from
one
fancied
injury
to
another
and
was
like
him
to
turn
up
and
plunge
into
this
wild
venture
that
would
probably
bring
them
both
to
and
if
jim
was
shot
what
the
devil
was
he
to
do
go
on
through
the
service
as
jim
horton
corporal
of
engineers
he
cursed
silently
while
he
groveled
in
the
gully
waiting
for
the
shots
that
were
to
decide
his
fate
for
a
moment
he
gathered
nerve
enough
to
pick
up
jim
s
rifle
and
accoutrement
with
the
intention
of
joining
the
squad
of
engineers
but
just
at
that
moment
there
were
sounds
of
shots
within
the
wood
followed
by
others
closer
at
hand
and
then
bullets
ripped
viciously
through
the
foliage
just
above
him
by
a
movement
just
ahead
of
him
he
knew
that
the
line
was
advancing
he
couldn
t
his
knees
refused
him
so
he
crawled
into
the
thicket
along
the
gully
and
lay
upon
the
ground
among
the
fallen
leaves
more
shots
cries
all
about
him
a
grunt
of
pain
after
a
shrapnel
burst
nearby
the
rush
of
feet
as
the
second
wave
filtered
through
then
the
rapid
crackle
of
the
engagement
in
the
wood
jim
was
uniform
he
d
be
taking
long
chances
too
he
had
always
been
a
fool
from
his
cover
he
marked
the
dawn
while
the
fighting
sunrise
the
fire
seemed
to
slacken
and
then
move
farther
away
the
line
was
still
advancing
and
only
the
wounded
were
coming
of
them
walking
cases
with
bandaged
heads
and
arms
he
eyed
them
through
the
bushes
why
couldn
t
he
have
gotten
a
wound
like
the
afternoon
in
the
wheat
of
finding
the
head
of
levinski
and
the
terror
that
it
had
brought
other
wounded
were
coming
on
stretchers
now
the
gully
near
him
made
an
easy
path
to
the
plain
below
and
many
of
them
passed
near
him
but
he
lay
very
still
beneath
the
leaves
what
if
jim
came
back
on
a
stretcher
what
should
he
do
then
suddenly
as
though
in
answer
to
his
question
two
men
emerged
from
the
hollow
above
and
approached
carrying
something
between
them
there
was
a
man
of
harry
s
own
platoon
and
a
sergeant
of
the
company
he
heard
their
voices
and
at
the
sound
of
them
he
cowered
lower
some
say
he
showed
yellow
yesterday
in
the
wheat
field
said
the
private
yellow
they
d
better
not
let
hear
em
sayin
they
were
talking
about
horton
and
the
figure
lying
awkwardly
a
shapeless
at
the
risk
of
discovery
the
coward
straightened
and
peered
down
into
the
white
face
jim
harry
horton
didn
t
remember
anything
very
distinctly
for
a
while
after
that
for
his
thoughts
were
much
confused
but
out
of
the
chaos
emerged
the
persistent
instinct
of
self
preservation
there
was
no
use
trying
to
find
jim
s
squad
now
he
wouldn
t
know
them
if
he
saw
them
and
how
could
he
explain
his
absence
with
no
wound
to
show
for
a
moment
the
desperate
expedient
occurred
to
him
of
thrusting
himself
through
the
leg
with
the
bayonet
he
even
took
jim
s
weapon
out
of
its
scabbard
but
the
blue
steel
gave
him
a
touch
of
the
nausea
that
had
come
over
him
in
the
wheat
field
that
wouldn
t
do
and
what
was
the
use
they
had
harry
horton
lying
near
death
on
the
stretcher
what
mattered
what
happened
to
the
brother
there
was
no
chance
now
to
exchange
identities
perhaps
there
was
never
to
be
a
chance
he
sank
down
again
into
the
thicket
pulling
the
leaves
about
him
he
would
find
a
way
it
could
be
managed
missing
was
the
safest
way
out
that
night
limping
slightly
he
emerged
and
made
his
way
to
the
rear
it
was
ridiculously
easy
of
the
men
he
met
he
asked
the
way
to
the
billets
of
the
regiment
but
he
didn
t
go
where
they
told
him
he
followed
their
instructions
until
out
of
sight
of
them
and
then
went
in
the
opposite
direction
he
managed
at
last
to
get
some
food
at
a
small
farm
house
and
under
the
pretext
of
having
been
sent
to
borrow
peasant
clothing
for
the
intelligence
department
managed
to
get
a
pair
of
trousers
shirt
coat
and
hat
he
had
buried
his
rifle
the
night
before
and
now
when
the
opportunity
came
he
dropped
the
bundle
of
jim
horton
s
corporal
s
uniform
weighted
by
a
stone
into
deep
water
from
a
bridge
over
a
river
with
the
splash
corporal
james
horton
of
the
engineers
had
ceased
to
exist
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
thanks
to
some
money
that
he
had
found
in
jim
s
a
great
deal
of
good
was
safe
in
a
quiet
pastoral
country
far
from
the
battle
line
here
he
saw
no
old
men
and
women
in
blouses
and
sabots
occupying
themselves
with
the
harvest
aware
only
that
the
boches
were
in
retreat
and
that
their
own
fields
were
forever
safe
from
invasion
he
represented
himself
as
an
american
art
student
of
paris
driven
by
poverty
from
the
city
and
offered
to
work
for
board
and
lodging
they
took
him
and
there
he
stayed
for
awhile
there
was
a
girl
in
the
family
it
was
very
pleasant
the
nearest
town
was
florentin
and
paris
was
a
hundred
miles
away
but
after
a
few
weeks
he
wearied
of
it
and
of
the
girl
and
having
twenty
francs
left
in
his
pockets
stole
away
in
the
middle
of
the
night
paris
was
the
place
for
him
there
identities
were
not
questioned
he
knew
something
of
paris
piquette
morin
he
could
get
her
help
without
telling
any
unnecessary
facts
as
to
barry
quinlevin
and
was
different
it
wouldn
t
be
pleasant
to
fall
completely
in
the
power
of
a
man
like
barry
if
he
was
now
his
and
moira
no
moira
mustn
t
ever
know
if
he
could
prevent
it
and
yet
if
jim
horton
in
harry
s
uniform
had
been
killed
harry
would
be
officially
dead
he
was
already
dead
to
moira
if
jim
horton
had
revived
enough
to
tell
the
truth
it
wasn
t
a
pretty
story
to
be
spread
around
but
if
jim
were
alive
what
then
there
were
ways
of
getting
along
in
paris
he
would
find
a
way
even
if
moira
he
would
have
liked
to
be
able
to
go
to
moira
she
was
the
one
creature
in
the
world
whose
opinion
seemed
to
matter
now
she
would
have
been
his
on
the
next
furlough
he
knew
women
if
you
couldn
t
get
them
one
way
you
could
another
already
her
letters
had
been
conciliatory
his
wife
of
an
outcast
god
why
had
he
ever
gone
into
the
service
how
had
he
known
back
there
that
he
wouldn
t
have
been
able
to
stand
up
under
he
would
have
found
the
grinning
head
of
the
hated
levinski
in
the
wheat
field
waves
of
goose
flesh
went
over
him
and
left
him
cold
and
weak
a
sullen
mood
followed
dull
embittered
and
vengeful
against
all
the
world
with
only
one
hope
if
jim
were
silent
that
opened
substitute
with
his
brother
and
come
back
to
his
all
the
honors
of
the
fool
performance
it
was
name
job
that
jim
had
taken
and
his
brother
couldn
t
keep
him
out
of
them
he
could
make
jim
give
them
d
him
if
he
couldn
t
come
back
himself
he
would
drag
jim
down
with
would
be
outcast
together
in
the
dark
that
night
he
would
have
managed
in
some
way
to
carry
out
the
major
s
orders
if
jim
hadn
t
found
him
just
at
the
worst
moment
what
right
had
jim
to
go
butting
in
and
making
a
fool
of
them
both
him
he
found
his
way
into
paris
at
the
end
of
a
dreary
day
of
tramping
he
had
a
few
francs
left
but
he
was
tired
and
very
hungry
with
a
lie
framed
he
went
straight
to
the
apartment
of
piquette
morin
she
had
gone
out
of
town
for
a
few
days
that
failure
baffled
him
he
had
a
deposit
in
a
bank
but
he
dared
not
draw
it
out
so
he
trudged
the
weary
way
up
to
montmartre
saving
his
sous
and
hired
a
bed
into
which
he
dropped
more
dead
than
alive
thus
it
was
that
two
nights
later
unable
yet
to
bring
himself
to
the
point
of
begging
from
passersby
with
scant
hope
indeed
of
success
his
weary
feet
brought
him
at
last
to
the
rue
de
tavennes
hiding
his
face
under
the
shadow
of
his
hat
he
inquired
of
the
and
found
that
the
apartment
of
madame
horton
was
he
strolled
past
the
and
walked
on
looking
hungrily
up
at
the
lighted
windows
of
the
studio
moira
was
wife
barry
quinlevin
perhaps
who
else
he
heard
sounds
of
laughter
from
somewhere
upstairs
laughter
the
bitterness
of
it
but
it
didn
t
sound
like
moira
s
voice
he
walked
to
and
fro
watching
the
lighted
windows
and
the
entrance
of
the
trying
to
keep
up
the
circulation
of
his
blood
for
the
night
was
chill
and
his
clothing
thin
he
had
no
he
was
very
hungry
and
his
resolution
to
remain
unknown
was
weakening
a
man
couldn
t
let
himself
slowly
starve
and
yet
to
seek
out
any
one
he
knew
meant
discovery
and
the
horrible
publicity
that
must
follow
the
lights
of
the
held
a
fascination
for
him
like
that
of
a
flame
for
a
moth
he
saw
a
figure
come
to
a
window
and
throw
open
the
sash
he
stared
unable
to
believe
his
eyes
it
was
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
an
officer
of
the
united
states
own
uniform
and
the
man
who
wore
it
was
his
brother
jim
covered
with
honors
moira
s
apartment
what
had
happened
to
bring
his
brother
here
and
moira
his
head
whirled
with
weakness
and
he
stood
for
a
moment
leaning
against
the
wall
but
his
strength
came
back
to
him
in
a
moment
and
he
peered
up
at
the
window
again
the
light
had
gone
out
jim
masquerading
in
his
her
perhaps
in
the
apartment
and
moira
the
words
of
conciliation
in
her
last
letters
which
had
seemed
to
promise
so
much
for
the
future
had
a
different
significance
here
fury
shook
him
like
a
leaf
the
fury
of
desperation
that
for
the
moment
drove
from
his
craven
heart
all
fear
of
an
encounter
with
his
brother
there
was
a
sound
of
a
door
shutting
and
in
a
moment
he
saw
the
man
in
uniform
emerge
by
the
gate
of
the
he
walked
toward
the
outcast
his
head
bent
in
deep
meditation
there
was
no
doubt
about
its
being
jim
with
clenched
fists
harry
barred
his
way
the
thought
that
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
finding
utterance
jim
horton
stopped
stepped
back
a
pace
and
then
peered
at
the
man
in
civilian
clothing
from
beneath
his
broad
army
harry
he
muttered
almost
inaudibly
what
are
you
doing
this
house
raged
harry
in
a
voice
thick
with
passion
and
then
as
no
reply
came
answer
me
answer
me
one
of
harry
s
fists
threatened
but
his
brother
caught
him
by
the
wrist
and
with
ridiculous
ease
twisted
his
arm
aside
he
was
surprised
as
harry
sank
back
weakly
against
the
wall
with
a
snarl
of
pain
you
he
groaned
this
wouldn
t
do
any
commotion
would
surely
arouse
the
curiosity
of
madame
toupin
the
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
harry
he
muttered
and
i
ll
talk
to
you
he
caught
him
firmly
by
the
arm
but
harry
still
leaned
against
the
wall
muttering
vaguely
a
civil
dare
ask
me
yes
said
jim
gently
i
ve
been
trying
to
find
you
where
leered
harry
in
my
wife
s
studio
jim
horton
turned
suddenly
furious
but
shocked
into
silence
and
inertia
by
the
terrible
significance
of
the
suspicion
but
he
pulled
himself
together
with
an
effort
come
he
said
quietly
let
s
get
away
from
here
he
felt
harry
yield
to
the
pressure
of
his
fingers
and
slowly
they
moved
into
the
shadows
down
the
street
away
from
the
gas
lamps
a
moment
later
harry
was
twitching
at
his
arm
me
something
to
cat
m
hungry
he
gasped
hungry
how
since
yesterday
crust
of
and
jim
had
been
eating
the
new
sense
of
his
own
guilt
appalled
him
since
he
muttered
in
a
quick
gush
of
compassion
we
ll
find
there
s
a
place
in
the
rue
s
he
said
weakly
jim
horton
caught
his
brother
under
an
elbow
and
helped
him
down
the
street
aware
for
the
first
time
of
the
cause
of
his
weakness
he
marked
too
the
haggard
lines
in
harry
s
face
and
the
two
weeks
growth
of
beard
that
effectually
concealed
all
evidence
of
respectability
there
seemed
little
danger
of
any
one
s
discovering
the
likeness
between
the
neatly
garbed
lieutenant
and
the
civilian
who
accompanied
him
but
it
was
well
to
be
careful
they
passed
a
brilliantly
lighted
restaurant
but
in
a
nearby
street
after
awhile
they
came
to
a
small
not
too
brightly
lighted
and
they
entered
there
was
a
polished
zinc
bar
which
ran
the
length
of
a
room
with
low
ceilings
at
the
bar
were
two
cochers
in
shirt
sleeves
their
hats
on
the
backs
of
their
heads
sipping
grenadine
there
was
a
winding
stair
which
led
to
the
living
quarters
above
but
through
a
doorway
beside
it
there
was
a
glimpse
of
an
inner
room
with
tables
unoccupied
they
entered
and
jim
horton
ordered
a
substantial
meal
which
was
presently
set
before
the
hungry
man
the
coffee
revived
him
and
he
ate
greedily
in
moody
silence
while
jim
horton
sat
frowning
at
the
opposite
wall
for
the
present
each
was
deeply
in
the
definite
problem
that
had
suddenly
presented
itself
and
the
possible
courses
of
action
open
to
do
what
was
to
be
required
of
him
harry
in
his
food
beyond
which
life
at
present
held
no
other
interest
but
after
a
while
which
seemed
interminable
to
jim
his
brother
gave
a
gasp
of
satisfaction
and
pushed
back
his
dishes
give
me
a
cigarette
he
demanded
with
something
of
an
air
jim
obeyed
and
even
furnished
a
light
not
missing
the
evidences
of
dutch
courage
harry
had
acquired
from
the
stimulation
of
food
and
coffee
it
was
curious
what
little
difference
the
amenities
seemed
to
matter
they
were
purely
would
it
matter
what
harry
was
to
say
to
him
the
main
thing
was
to
try
to
think
clearly
obliterating
his
own
animus
against
his
brother
and
the
contempt
in
which
he
held
him
harry
sank
back
into
his
chair
for
a
moment
inhaling
luxuriously
well
he
said
at
last
maybe
you
ve
got
a
word
to
say
about
how
the
devil
you
got
here
yes
said
jim
quickly
it
s
very
simple
i
was
hit
i
took
your
identity
in
the
hospital
there
wasn
t
anything
else
to
do
harry
glowered
at
the
ash
of
his
cigarette
and
then
shrugged
heavily
i
see
they
think
you
re
me
that
was
nice
of
you
jim
he
sneered
very
decent
indeed
very
kind
and
you
d
better
can
the
irony
jim
broke
in
briefly
they
d
have
found
us
of
us
and
i
reckon
you
know
what
that
would
have
meant
maybe
i
do
maybe
i
don
t
he
said
shrewdly
it
was
you
who
found
nobody
else
did
we
needn
t
speak
of
that
we
might
as
well
i
d
have
come
around
all
right
if
you
hadn
t
butted
in
oh
would
you
yes
said
harry
sullenly
jim
horton
carefully
lighted
a
cigarette
from
the
butt
of
the
other
and
then
said
coolly
we
re
not
getting
anywhere
harry
i
think
we
are
i
m
trying
to
show
you
that
you
re
in
wrong
on
this
thing
from
start
to
finish
and
it
looks
as
though
you
might
get
just
what
was
coming
to
you
meaning
what
that
you
ll
take
my
place
again
exhibiting
with
a
grin
his
worn
garments
you
took
mine
without
a
now
you
ll
give
it
back
to
me
an
ugly
look
came
into
jim
horton
s
jaw
i
m
not
so
sure
about
that
he
said
in
a
tone
dangerously
quiet
what
you
mean
the
bluster
trailed
off
into
silence
at
the
warning
fire
in
his
brother
s
eyes
but
he
raised
his
head
in
a
moment
laughing
disagreeably
i
see
the
promotion
has
got
into
your
head
some
right
off
the
corporal
too
living
soft
in
the
hospital
and
he
paused
and
swallowed
uneasily
how
did
you
get
to
the
rue
de
tavennes
they
came
to
the
quinlevin
your
wife
fooled
them
they
don
t
suspect
did
you
know
moira
was
my
wife
some
letters
i
read
them
oh
i
see
you
read
them
he
frowned
and
then
barry
quinlevin
s
too
too
i
had
to
have
facts
i
got
i
wasn
t
looking
about
the
duc
de
vautrin
jim
broke
in
dryly
that
s
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
m
still
harry
horton
and
why
i
m
going
to
stay
harry
the
present
if
jim
had
needed
any
assurance
as
to
his
brother
s
share
in
this
intrigue
he
had
it
now
for
harry
went
red
and
then
pale
refusing
to
meet
his
gaze
i
see
he
muttered
quinlevin
s
been
talking
yes
said
jim
craftily
he
has
it
s
a
pretty
plan
but
it
won
t
come
off
you
always
were
a
rotter
harry
but
you
re
not
going
to
hurt
moira
if
i
can
prevent
it
was
a
shot
but
it
hit
the
mark
moira
muttered
harry
somberly
i
see
you
haven
t
been
wasting
any
time
i
m
not
wasting
time
when
i
can
keep
even
getting
mixed
up
in
dirty
blackmail
that
s
my
answer
and
that
s
why
i
m
not
going
to
quit
until
i
m
ready
harry
horton
frowned
at
the
soiled
table
cover
his
fingers
twitching
at
his
fork
and
then
reached
for
the
coffee
pot
and
quickly
poured
himself
another
cup
clever
jim
he
said
with
a
cynical
laugh
i
take
off
my
hat
to
you
i
never
would
have
thought
you
had
it
in
you
but
you
ll
admit
that
living
in
my
wife
s
apartment
and
impersonating
her
husband
is
going
a
bit
too
far
the
laughter
didn
t
serve
to
conceal
either
his
fear
or
his
fury
but
it
stopped
short
as
jim
s
fingers
suddenly
closed
over
his
wrist
and
held
it
in
a
grip
of
iron
don
t
bring
into
this
he
whispered
tensely
do
you
hear
and
after
a
moment
of
struggle
with
himself
as
he
withdrew
his
hand
you
dared
to
think
yourself
worthy
of
her
be
careful
what
you
say
to
me
said
harry
trying
bravado
she
s
my
wife
she
won
t
be
your
wife
long
when
i
tell
her
what
i
know
about
you
finished
jim
angrily
he
saw
harry
s
face
go
pale
again
as
he
tried
to
meet
his
gaze
saw
the
fire
flicker
out
of
him
as
he
groped
pitiably
for
jim
s
hand
jim
wouldn
t
do
that
he
muttered
jim
released
his
hand
shrugged
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
not
if
you
play
straight
with
with
her
you
want
me
to
pay
the
penalty
of
what
i
did
for
go
out
into
the
outcast
in
your
place
perhaps
i
owe
it
to
you
i
don
t
know
but
you
owe
me
something
de
the
de
lieutenant
harry
horton
to
be
gazetted
put
in
jim
with
some
pride
not
you
a
brief
silence
in
which
harry
rubbed
his
scrawny
beard
with
his
long
fingers
that
might
be
difficult
to
prove
to
my
company
captain
he
said
at
last
you
forget
my
wounds
laughed
jim
oh
they
re
wounds
all
right
and
then
with
a
shrug
you
see
harry
it
won
t
work
you
re
helpless
if
i
chose
to
keep
on
the
job
you
d
be
left
out
in
the
cold
you
won
t
i
don
t
know
what
i
d
dare
it
depends
on
you
what
do
you
mean
broke
in
harry
with
some
spirit
i
couldn
t
be
any
worse
off
than
i
am
now
even
if
i
told
the
truth
jim
laughed
tried
to
tell
in
the
hospital
and
they
thought
i
was
try
it
if
you
like
harry
frowned
and
reached
for
another
cigarette
and
then
after
awhile
do
you
want
me
to
do
his
brother
examined
him
steadily
for
a
moment
and
then
went
on
i
don
t
know
whether
you
ve
learned
anything
in
the
army
or
not
but
it
ought
to
have
taught
you
that
you
ve
got
to
live
straight
with
your
buddy
or
you
can
t
get
on
straight
sneered
harry
like
you
call
this
you
re
doing
no
jim
admitted
it
s
not
straight
it
s
crooked
as
hell
but
if
it
wasn
t
you
d
have
been
drummed
out
of
the
service
by
now
i
don
t
want
you
to
think
i
care
about
i
didn
there
it
was
only
the
honor
of
the
service
i
was
thinking
about
i
d
do
it
again
if
i
had
to
but
i
do
care
about
this
girl
you
ve
bamboozled
into
marrying
and
quinlevin
and
whatever
the
dirty
arrangement
between
you
that
made
it
possible
i
want
to
make
it
clear
to
you
here
and
now
that
she
isn
t
going
to
be
mixed
up
in
any
of
your
rotten
deals
she
isn
t
your
sort
and
you
couldn
t
drag
her
down
to
your
level
if
you
tried
i
ll
know
more
when
quinlevin
gets
back
and
jim
horton
paused
as
he
realized
that
he
had
said
too
much
for
he
saw
his
brother
start
and
then
stare
at
him
ah
barry
away
jim
nodded
yes
he
said
in
ireland
harry
had
risen
glowering
and
you
think
i
m
going
to
slink
off
to
my
kennel
and
let
you
go
back
to
the
studio
you
in
my
moira
jim
horton
thought
deeply
for
a
moment
and
then
rose
and
coolly
straightened
his
military
blouse
very
well
he
said
we
ll
go
back
to
her
together
he
took
out
some
money
and
carelessly
walked
toward
the
bar
in
the
front
room
but
harry
followed
quickly
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
jim
he
muttered
you
won
t
do
that
we
ll
tell
her
the
guess
you
re
right
she
ought
to
know
wait
a
his
hand
was
trembling
on
the
officer
s
sleeve
and
the
dark
beard
seemed
to
make
the
face
look
ghastly
under
its
tan
not
yet
jim
not
ll
have
to
let
things
be
for
awhile
just
sit
down
again
for
a
minute
we
ve
got
to
find
a
way
to
straighten
this
thing
get
you
back
into
your
old
how
dryly
don
t
know
just
now
but
we
can
work
it
it
s
too
you
could
have
been
captured
by
the
boches
we
can
find
a
way
when
you
let
me
have
my
uniform
jim
horton
grinned
unsympathetically
there
are
two
wounds
in
that
too
harry
he
said
where
are
yours
and
he
moved
toward
the
door
listen
jim
we
ll
let
things
be
as
they
are
for
the
present
barry
quinlevin
mustn
t
ve
got
to
play
the
part
i
see
come
and
sit
down
a
minute
his
brother
obeyed
mechanically
well
he
said
i
ll
do
what
you
we
can
think
of
something
he
tried
a
smile
and
failed
i
know
it
s
a
good
deal
to
ask
take
my
go
out
into
the
world
and
be
what
i
am
but
you
won
t
have
to
do
it
you
won
t
have
to
we
ll
manage
way
you
go
back
to
the
he
paused
uncertainly
you
re
he
paused
jim
horton
read
his
meaning
making
love
to
your
wife
and
if
i
was
it
would
only
be
what
you
deserve
she
doesn
t
love
you
any
too
much
as
it
is
harry
frowned
at
the
floor
and
was
silent
but
his
brother
s
answer
satisfied
him
all
right
you
go
i
ve
got
to
get
some
money
i
can
t
starve
i
don
t

shrugged
all

but

and

harry
nodded
and
put
the
bills
into
his
pocket
while
jim
rose
again
you
play
the
game
straight
with
me
he
said
and
i
ll
put
this
thing
right
even
he
paused
suddenly
in
the
doorway
his
sentence
unfinished
for
just
in
front
of
him
stood
a
very
handsome
girl
who
had
abandoned
her
companion
and
stood
both
hands
outstretched
in
greeting
arry
orton
she
was
saying
joyously
in
broken
english
you
don
seem
to
know
me
it
is
the
name
quinlevin
had
spoke
in
the
hospital
jim
glanced
over
his
shoulder
into
the
shadow
where
harry
had
been
but
his
brother
had
disappeared
she
wore
a
black
velvet
toque
which
bore
upon
its
front
two
large
crimson
wings
poised
for
flight
and
they
seemed
to
typify
the
girl
on
a
bird
of
passage
she
had
a
nose
very
slightly
black
eyes
rather
small
but
expressive
with
brows
and
lids
skillfully
tinted
her
figure
was
graceful
and
extraordinarily
well
groomed
from
her
white
gloves
to
the
tips
of
her
slender
shiny
boots
and
seemed
out
of
place
in
the
shadows
of
these
murky
surroundings
for
the
rest
she
was
mischievous
tingling
with
vitality
and
joyous
at
this
unexpected
meeting
horton
glanced
past
her
and
saw
a
figure
in
a
slouch
hat
go
out
of
the
door
then
from
the
darkness
turn
and
beckon
but
jim
horton
was
given
no
opportunity
to
escape
and
harry
s
warning
gesture
if
anything
served
to
increase
his
curiosity
as
to
this
lovely
apparition
monsieur
orton
she
said
indicating
her
companion
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
then
as
he
shook
hands
with
her
companion
a
handsome
man
with
a
grayish
mustache
monsieur
valcourt
is
one
day
de
greatest
sculptor
in
de
orton
is
de
ero
of
boissi√®re
wood
you
know
of
the
fight
in
put
in
jim
and
who
does
not
it
is
all
in
ere
i
find
you
trying
to
ide
yourself
in
the
obscure
of
monsieur
javet
she
stopped
suddenly
and
before
he
realized
what
she
was
about
had
thrown
her
arms
over
his
shoulders
and
kissed
him
squarely
upon
the
lips
he
felt
a
good
deal
of
a
fool
with
monsieur
valcourt
and
the
javet
grinning
at
them
but
the
experience
was
not
unpleasant
and
he
returned
her
greeting
whole
heartedly
wondering
what
was
to
come
next
and
when
laughing
gayly
she
released
him
he
turned
toward
monsieur
valcourt
who
was
regarding
her
with
a
dubious
smile
for
all
her
prosperity
monsieur
orton
valcourt
was
saying
in
french
she
is
still
a
and
who
would
wonder
to
live
expensively
is
very
comfortable
but
even
comfort
is
tedious
does
not
one
wish
to
laugh
with
a
full
throat
to
kick
one
s
toes
or
to
put
one
s
heels
upon
a
table
i
do
not
intend
to
grow
too
respectable
i
assure
you
jim
horton
laughed
she
had
spoken
partly
in
english
partly
in
french
translating
for
both
and
then
let
me
assure
you
madame
said
valcourt
with
a
stately
bow
that
you
are
not
in
the
slightest
danger
of
that
but
she
was
already
turning
to
horton
again
a
ero
the
world
is
full
of
eros
but
not
one
like
my
arry
orton
i
mus
ave
a
talk
with
you
alone
lucien
she
said
sharply
turning
to
valcourt
i
will
come
to
de
studio
monsieur
le
duc
t
inks
i
am
gone
away
but
now
i
would
be
a
poor
creature
not
to
give
my
brave
soldier
a
welcome
if
monsieur
will
excuse
said
valcourt
offering
his
hand
jim
horton
took
it
wondering
where
the
adventure
was
to
lead
she
was
a
very
remarkable
person
and
her
had
already
carried
him
off
his
feet
taking
his
hand
in
hers
with
a
charming
simplicity
she
led
him
into
the
room
at
the
rear
now
occupied
by
a
number
of
persons
of
both
sexes
and
bade
monsieur
javet
himself
serve
them
and
when
they
were
seated
at
a
table
her
hand
still
in
his
she
examined
him
with
a
new
interest
it
is
indeed
you
she
said
gayly
and
yet
you
seem
calm
more
silent
what
is
it
i
ve
had
two
months
in
the
hospital
and
you
re
quite
strong
again
oh
yes
and
you
have
been
ennuy√©e
it
is
why
i
come
back
here
to
de
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
i
ve
been
posing
for
monsieur
he
says
my
figure
is
better
than
ever
and
valcourt
knows
i
m
sure
you
are
very
lovely
la
mon
but
you
are
the
of
course
i
am
lovely
it
is
my
business
but
you
do
not
me
ow
lovely
i
am
for
you
are
so
jim
horton
laughed
and
caught
her
fingers
to
his
lips
you
that
is
enough
est
but
you
are
change
one
does
not
look
deat
in
de
eyes
wit
out
feeling
its
col
touch
oh
but
i
am
glad
that
you
are
come
back
to
me
you
s
all

ere
long
i
don
t
i
shall
get
my
orders
but
until
ings
s
all

as
dey
were
wit
us
two
eh
my
little
one
an
i
s
all
elp
you
now
in
de
great
affair
but
monsieur
de
vautrin
becomes
more
onpleasant
he
is
a
very
tiresome
ol
man
jim
horton
started
unconsciously
then
remembered
that
it
was
in
connection
with
de
vautrin
that
quinlevin
had
mentioned
this
very
girl
piquette
he
understood
better
now
the
reason
for
harry
s
gesture
from
the
outer
darkness
the
meeting
had
been
a
stroke
of
fate
perhaps
she
held
the
key
to
the
riddle
tiresome
yes
he
said
slowly
all
old
men
are
and
she
mused
sipping
at
her
glass
while
i
am
pretty
he
likes
to
have
me
nearby
but
i
know
he
cares
not
ing
he
will
leave
me
not
ing
i
am
not
content
so
i
say
i
want
to
help
in
de
great
affair
you
have
planned
somet
ing
in
the
and
monsieur
quinlevin
definite
monsieur
le
duc
still
pays
horton
meditated
for
a
moment
no
he
said
he
has
stopped
paying
piquette
morin
leaned
further
over
the
table
frowning
ah
since
when
months
or
more
then
you
t
ink
he
suspects
somet
ing
i
don
t
know
it
looks
so
doesn
t
it
yes
perhaps
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
i
make
him
talk
about
de
past
as
you
ask
me
to
i
am
no
saint
and
de
has
taught
me
to
look
out
for
myself
i
shall
continue
if
he
tries
to
get
rid
of
me
de
way
he
did
wit
his
wife
he
will
find
me
troublesome
horton
laughed
i
don
t
doubt
it
and
then
carefully
you
heard
how
he
got
rid
of
her
he
questioned
it
was
er
riches
of
course
e
spent
er
in
a
few
month
gambling
at
monte
carlo
and
den
when
e
came
to
er
for
more
e
abuse
and
beat
er
she
paused
and
her
dark
eyes
snapped
viciously
e
would
not
have
beaten
me
she
finished
and
then
he
asked
wondering
whither
the
conversation
was
leading
and
den
as
you
know
she
ran
away
to
to
he
muttered
eagerly
of
course
she
said
with
a
glance
at
him
and
when
e
got
enough
money
e
sail
round
de
worl
enjoying
himself
even
now
sometimes
e
is
a
beast
it
is
den
i
come
back
to
de
where
i
am
born
and
be
merry
again
she
sighed
and
then
laughed
gayly
but
we
mus
not
talk
of
dis
tiresome
matter
it
is
your
night
and
we
s
all
make
it
appy
he
kissed
the
rosy
palm
she
thrust
to
his
lips
with
difficulty
concealing
his
curiosity
but
the
child
of
monsieur
the
he
urged
after
the
moment
of
he
said
he
paused
as
though
in
doubt
she
shrugged
carelessly
and
lighted
a
cigarette
monsieur
is
cautious
e
spoke
not
ing
of
de
child
except
to
say
dat
it
died
wit
de
mother
de
money
came
to
im
dat
was
all
e
cared
about
arry
to
jim
horton
no
light
seemed
to
dawn
and
how
to
question
without
arousing
the
girl
s
suspicions
was
more
that
he
could
plan
but
he
remembered
quinlevin
s
uncertainty
in
the
thought
that
harry
might
have
talked
to
this
girl
so
he
took
a
chance
you
asked
the
duc
no
questions
that
might
have
aroused
his
suspicions
no
i
t
ink
not
and
yet
i
remember
once
e
ask
me
if
i
know
monsieur
quinlevin
and
what
did
you
reply
of
course
dat
i
never
heard
of
im
he
frowned
at
the
cigarette
in
his
fingers
as
harry
would
have
frowned
and
imitated
as
nearly
as
possible
the
sullen
mood
of
his
brother
the
money
has
stopped
coming
to
quinlevin
we
ve
got
to
do
something
said
piquette
carelessly
de
time
as
come
to
produce
de
girl
moira
and
de
papers
her
glance
was
not
upon
his
face
or
she
would
have
seen
the
look
of
bewilderment
and
surprise
suddenly
distend
his
eyes
but
she
heard
him
gasp
and
turned
again
toward
him
but
by
this
time
the
missing
pieces
of
the
puzzle
were
at
his
fingers
ends
and
he
gathered
them
quickly
it
was
moira
who
all
these
years
had
unconsciously
impersonated
the
dead
child
who
would
have
inherited
and
quinlevin
had
bled
the
duc
for
years
with
promises
of
silence
harry
had
connived
at
the
plot
and
now
the
coup
they
planned
meant
a
sum
of
not
less
than
seven
figures
and
piquette
knew
all
blackmail
it
the
blackest
for
a
moment
he
did
not
dare
to
speak
for
fear
of
betraying
himself
and
then
only
assented
safely
to
her
suggestion
yes
it
is
the
only
thing
to
be
done
it
mus
be
manage
carefully
you
are
sure
de
papers
are
all
correct
it
is
as
to
that
monsieur
quinlevin
has
gone
to
ireland
ah
i
mus
wait
until
e
comes
back
but
i
s
all
elp
you
you
will
rely
upon
me
est
ce
yes
i
will
his
mind
was
so
full
of
this
astonishing
revelation
that
he
sat
silent
and
motionless
while
she
changed
the
subject
and
chattered
on
the
charm
of
the
chance
encounter
was
gone
she
might
be
and
irresponsible
like
others
of
her
kind
in
paris
or
elsewhere
but
she
was
not
for
him
he
had
a
standard
to
measure
her
by
you
are
so
arry
she
broke
in
suddenly
i
do
not
t
ink
i
like
you
so
what
s
all
we
care
you
and
i
for
monsieur
le
duc
an
is
money
to
be
young
an
in
she
caught
both
of
his
hands
across
the
table
and
held
them
you
are
not
yet
well
arry
i
can
see
it
is
dat
for
so
long
you
do
not
know
comfort
an
appiness
i
s
all
make
you
laugh
again
until
de
look
come
no
more
into
your
eyes
he
was
about
to
give
some
token
of
his
appreciation
that
would
satisfy
her
when
he
saw
her
glance
past
his
shoulder
toward
the
door
which
led
into
the
bar
your
frien
who
was
wit
e
as
come
back
again
she
whispered
he
turned
and
saw
harry
peering
through
the
door
e
wants
you
to
come
est
sen
im
away
i
m
afraid
he
rose
uncertainly
and
turned
wait
he
said
i
ll
see
and
then
walked
out
into
the
bar
where
harry
obstinately
awaited
him
i
ve
had
enough
of
this
growled
his
brother
you
come
out
of
here
with
me
or
i
don
t
be
a
fool
you
could
see
that
i
couldn
t
help
it
you
can
help
it
all
right
we
ll
have
this
thing
out
you
and
you
meet
me
at
the
corner
toward
the
boulevard
in
twenty
minutes
i
ll
get
rid
of
her
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
returned
to
piquette
his
mind
made
up
i
m
sorry
he
said
to
her
but
i
ve
some
urgent
business
with
this
man
it
can
t
be
put
off
but
i
must
see
you
she
pouted
and
rose
i
can
t
now
you
won
t
be
it
is
she
asked
shrewdly
how
can
you
ask
no
there
are
no
other
women
in
paris
piquette
you
are
cruel
she
muttered
in
a
low
tone
her
dark
eyes
flashing
no
it
is
a
matter
of
importance
will
you
let
me
have
your
no
boulevard
same
place
good
i
will
write
you
without
a
word
she
gathered
up
her
cloak
and
led
the
way
out
looking
about
curiously
for
her
enemy
of
the
evening
but
harry
had
disappeared
she
said
nothing
and
they
went
out
into
the
street
where
jim
horton
found
a
cab
and
put
her
into
it
m√©chant
she
whispered
softly
it
is
not
my
fault
piquette
he
gave
the
address
to
the
and
she
was
gone
jim
horton
stood
for
a
moment
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
retreating
as
it
rattled
away
over
the
cobblestones
and
then
turned
slowly
back
his
anger
at
his
discoveries
long
repressed
by
the
necessities
of
his
masquerade
suddenly
bursting
the
barriers
of
his
catspaw
the
for
these
two
rascals
how
much
did
she
know
how
could
quinlevin
have
carried
the
deception
out
all
these
years
without
de
vautrin
suspecting
something
and
if
as
it
seemed
he
was
suspicious
of
them
now
who
had
told
his
own
duty
seemed
very
clear
every
impulse
of
honor
and
decency
urged
that
he
find
this
duc
de
vautrin
and
tell
the
whole
truth
but
there
was
moira
his
first
duty
was
to
her
but
telling
her
meant
revealing
the
secret
of
harry
s
disgrace
and
his
own
part
in
it
that
would
be
a
difficult
thing
to
do
but
he
would
have
to
do
it
he
would
tell
her
as
for
would
make
short
work
of
he
went
with
long
determined
strides
to
the
appointed
spot
and
harry
met
him
with
a
threatening
air
what
the
hell
has
she
been
saying
he
muttered
jim
horton
was
angry
but
he
kept
himself
well
in
hand
aware
of
his
own
physical
superiority
to
this
blustering
shell
of
intrigue
deceit
and
cowardice
built
in
his
own
image
if
earlier
in
the
evening
he
had
had
his
moments
of
pity
for
his
brother
s
misfortunes
if
he
had
planned
to
make
restitution
for
the
imprudence
that
had
resulted
in
their
undoing
he
had
no
such
gentle
feeling
or
purpose
now
as
he
didn
t
reply
his
brother
continued
angrily
you
ve
gone
about
your
limit
i
tell
you
what
did
she
tell
you
everything
i
ve
got
the
whole
story
and
i
d
like
to
tell
you
before
we
go
any
further
that
you
re
just
about
the
he
broke
off
with
a
shrug
what
s
the
use
the
worst
thing
i
could
say
would
be
a
compliment
but
you
ve
come
to
the
end
of
your
tether
i
don
t
know
why
i
hoped
there
might
be
a
chance
of
getting
you
to
go
i
did
the
interesting
revelations
of
this
charming
lady
have
removed
the
impression
the
money
you
took
from
the
estate
your
questionable
deals
in
america
your
habits
put
you
outside
the
pale
of
decency
but
the
blackmail
of
the
duc
with
your
own
wife
as
harry
in
a
sudden
blind
fury
that
took
no
thought
of
consequences
struck
viciously
but
jim
who
had
been
watching
for
the
blow
warded
it
tripped
his
brother
neatly
and
sent
him
spinning
against
the
wall
where
he
fell
and
lay
motionless
but
he
was
bewildered
by
the
result
of
his
own
incapacity
get
up
jim
ordered
somebody
will
be
coming
along
in
a
moment
and
we
ll
both
be
going
with
the
police
harry
saw
reason
in
that
and
slowly
got
to
his
feet
pale
still
trembling
with
rage
rubbing
his
hip
joint
but
subdued
the
place
they
had
chosen
was
in
the
shadow
and
the
hour
was
late
and
no
one
was
about
but
jim
horton
took
a
glance
up
and
down
the
deserted
street
before
he
resumed
his
interrupted
remarks
i
don
t
want
any
man
s
uniform
when
it
s
been
defiled
you
ought
to
have
known
that
i
m
going
to
take
it
off
and
give
it
back
to
you
he
saw
the
eager
surprised
look
that
came
into
harry
s
face
and
raised
his
hand
in
but
not
yet
first
i
m
going
to
tell
your
wife
the
truth
and
then
i
m
going
to
warn
the
duc
de
vautrin
harry
started
back
as
though
to
dodge
another
blow
the
reaction
of
his
venture
setting
in
with
the
terror
of
this
information
jim
he
whispered
clutching
at
his
arm
you
wouldn
t
do
that
jim
my
god
it
s
ruin
to

thing

his
mine

he
wouldn

have
thought
of
it
if
the
old
man
hadn
t
shut
off
the
tell
me
the
truth
jim
broke
in
sternly
how
much
money

thousand

contemptuously
i
wanted

the
truth

were

of
this
money
of
the
duc

harry
halted
mumbling
that
wasn
t
settled
well
it
s
settled

said
jim
with
an
air
of
finality
turning
aside
what

morning

t
jim
why
she
d
go

to
quinlevin
i

the
duke
harry
leaned
back
against
the
wall
his
fingers
working
at
his
trouser
legs
but
he
was
speechless
that
s
about
all
i
think
said
jim
dryly
then

thing

and

until

chance
to
think

fresh
start

jim

a
moment
of
deliberation
i

promise

but
i
ll
meet
you
night
at
javet
the
money
harry
gasped
a
sigh
of
relief
and
straightened
offering
his
hand
thanks
jim
and
you
won
t
tell
her
i
know
you
couldn
t
it
would
be
too
cruel

but

it
jim
she
believes

even
if
she
doesn
t
believe
in
me
it
will
kill
her
he
saw
that
he
had
made
an
impression
on
his
brother
jim
stood
silent
his
head
bowed
don
t
tell
her
jim
harry
pleaded
promise
jim
shrugged
and
turned
all
right
he
said
at
last
i
ll
sleep
on
it
he
turned
away
and
walked
slowly
out
into
the
dim
light
of
the
street
moving
toward
the
rue
de
tavennes
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
to
see
what
became
of
his
brother
already
he
had
forgotten
him
the
heat
of
his
passion
had
suffered
a
strange
reaction
to
resolve
to
tell
moira
the
truth
even
to
threaten
to
tell
her
was
one
thing
but
to
tell
was
another
and
curiously
enough
harry
s
picture
of
the
consequences
drawn
even
in
the
stress
of
fear
was
true
knew
true
he
knew
her
pride
her
spirit
the
revelation
would
kill
destroy
her
she
was
so
dependent
on
him
she
didn
t
know
how
greatly
and
he
had
been
until
the
present
moment
so
dependent
upon
her
he
realized
what
her
visits
had
meant
to
him
how
deep
had
been
the
joy
of
their
evening
alone
in
the
studio
he
did
not
dare
to
think
of
her
now
as
he
had
been
thinking
of
her
during
the
weeks
of
his
convalescence
and
the
culmination
of
their
friendship
harry
had
seemed
far
off
vague
and
impalpable
but
their
meeting
had
changed
all
this
and
he
was
thankful
that
he
had
had
enough
manhood
to
keep
his
wits
when
he
had
been
alone
with
her
pity
of
given
him
signs
that
he
might
read
and
run
that
the
mockery
of
the
marriage
was
a
mockery
no
longer
and
it
was
her
very
confession
of
indifference
and
pity
for
harry
as
she
had
known
him
that
seemed
to
give
jim
the
right
to
care
for
and
protect
her
he
care
for
her
he
was
now
willing
to
confess
in
a
way
far
from
fraternal
he
had
always
been
too
busy
to
think
about
women
but
moira
had
crept
into
his
life
when
he
was
ill
and
unnerved
needing
the
touch
of
a
friendly
hand
and
their
peculiar
relationship
had
given
him
no
chance
of
her
she
had
captured
his
imagination
and
he
had
succeeded
where
harry
had
not
in
winning
her
affection
it
was
a
dangerous
situation
and
yet
it
fascinated
him
the
knowledge
that
he
must
cause
her
suffering
had
weakened
his
resolve
for
a
moment
but
as
he
walked
into
the
rue
de
tavennes
he
saw
it
for
the
fool
s
paradise
that
it
was
he
would
spend
with
could
do
no
harm
and
should
know
everything
he
found
his
way
into
the
court
and
up
the
stairs
the
studio
door
was
closed
implacable
as
the
destiny
that
barred
him
from
her
he
went
into
his
room
closed
the
door
and
slowly
undressed
then
lay
on
the
bed
staring
for
a
long
while
at
the
reflection
of
the
upon
the
ceiling
moira
happiness
dishonor
or
outcast
but
honorable
but
weariness
and
anxiety
had
to
pay
tribute
at
last
and
he
slept
it
was
broad
daylight
when
he
awoke
to
the
sound
of
a
loud
hammering
upon
the
door
and
a
high
clear
humorous
voice
calling
his
name
lazy
bones
get
up
will
you
be
lying
abed
all
day
he
opened
his
eyes
with
an
effort
and
glanced
at
his
wrist
eight
o
clock
coffee
in
the
studio
harry
dear
in
ten
minutes
oh
all
the
hammering
stopped
retreated
and
jim
horton
tumbled
out
rubbing
his
eyes
and
gazing
at
the
golden
lozenges
of
light
upon
the
wall
it
was
a
most
inspiriting
arresting
as
the
shrill
clarion
of
camp
on
a
frosty
morning
but
sweeter
far
joyous
with
promise
of
the
new
day
it
was
only
during
the
progress
of
his
hasty
toilet
that
the
douche
of
cold
water
over
his
head
and
face
recalled
to
him
with
unpleasant
suddenness
and
distinctness
the
events
of
the
night
before
and
he
emerged
from
vigorous
rubbing
exhilarated
but
sober
there
was
a
lot
of
thinking
to
be
done
and
a
difficult
resolution
to
make
and
with
moira
at
his
elbow
it
wasn
t
going
to
be
easy
but
by
the
time
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
studio
the
pleasure
of
the
immediate
prospect
made
ready
his
good
cheer
for
the
morning
greeting
he
heard
her
voice
calling
and
entered
a
new
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
and
an
odor
of
coffee
filled
the
air
she
emerged
from
the
door
of
the
small
kitchen
a
and
a
heaping
plateful
of
in
her
hands
good
morning
i
ve
been
waiting
for
you
an
hour
or
more
you
ve
been
developing
amazing
bad
habits
in
the
hospital
why
didn
t
you
call
me
before
sure
and
i
believed
you
might
be
thinking
i
was
anxious
to
see
you
and
aren
t
you
and
do
you
think
i
d
be
if
i
was
you
might
and
i
won
t
will
you
have
your
coffee
with
cream
and
sugar
if
you
please
it
was
real
cream
and
real
magic
of
madame
toupin
s
she
explained
and
the
were
unsurpassed
and
so
they
sat
and
ate
moira
chattering
gayly
of
plans
for
the
day
while
the
ancient
dowager
upon
the
easel
who
had
braved
the
fokkers
and
the
cannon
looked
down
upon
them
benignly
and
with
a
little
touch
of
pity
too
as
though
she
knew
how
much
of
their
courage
was
to
be
required
of
them
horton
ate
silently
putting
in
a
word
here
and
there
content
to
listen
to
her
plans
to
watch
the
deft
motions
of
her
fingers
and
the
changing
expressions
upon
her
face
once
or
twice
he
caught
her
looking
at
him
with
a
puzzled
line
at
her
brows
but
he
let
his
glance
pass
and
spoke
of
casual
things
the
location
of
the
bank
where
he
must
get
his
money
the
excellence
of
the
coffee
the
kindness
of
nurse
newberry
aware
that
these
topics
were
not
the
ones
uppermost
in
his
mind
or
in
hers
you
re
a
bit
subdued
this
morning
harry
dear
she
said
at
last
whimsically
maybe
that
goose
was
too
much
for
you
subdued
he
laughed
you
have
all
the
air
of
a
man
with
something
on
his
conscience
you
used
to
wear
that
look
in
america
and
i
let
you
be
but
somehow
things
seemed
different
with
us
two
would
you
be
willing
to
tell
me
there
isn
t
a
your
kindness
i
don
t
deserve
that
you
know
she
looked
at
him
seriously
and
then
broke
into
laughter
would
it
make
you
feel
more
comfortable
if
i
laid
you
over
the
shoulders
with
a
mahl
stick
i
think
it
would
he
grinned
sure
and
that
is
one
of
the
few
pleasant
prerogatives
of
ireland
and
added
horton
but
i
do
want
to
know
if
anything
s
troubling
you
are
you
still
she
took
a
and
smiled
at
it
amiably
because
we
re
not
appropriately
chaperoned
so
much
i
see
you
re
quite
able
to
look
out
for
yourself
and
you
derive
some
comfort
from
the
fact
she
asked
he
looked
at
her
their
eyes
met
and
they
both
burst
into
laughter
witch
but
you
d
better
not
tempt
me
too
far
sure
and
i
m
not
afraid
of
you
alanah
she
said
sedate
again
and
very
cool
or
of
any
man
and
then
mischievously
but
your
doubts
needn
t
have
kept
you
from
kissing
me
a
good
morning
it
s
not
too
late
now
said
horton
abruptly
rising
and
spilling
his
coffee
he
passed
the
small
table
toward
her
but
she
held
him
off
with
a
hand
no
the
essence
is
gone
you
ll
please
pick
up
your
and
pass
the
butter
thanks
it
s
very
nice
butter
isn
t
it
excellent
he
said
gloomily
and
now
you
re
vexed
is
there
no
pleasing
a
man
if
you
d
only
stop
d
make
it
easier
for
me
to
see
a
she
was
all
attention
at
once
listening
but
he
paused
and
set
his
down
with
an
air
of
finality
stop
pleasing
sure
and
you
must
not
ask
the
impossible
she
said
her
mouth
full
but
he
wouldn
t
smile
and
only
glowered
into
the
fire
i
want
you
to
let
me
try
to
pay
you
what
i
owe
earn
your
respect
and
well
i
m
letting
you
she
smiled
over
her
ve
gotten
you
under
false
the
spell
of
temporary
sense
of
duty
he
rambled
saying
partly
what
harry
might
say
and
partly
what
was
in
his
own
heart
i
want
to
win
the
right
to
you
to
show
you
i
m
not
as
rotten
as
you
used
to
think
he
didn
t
know
how
far
the
thought
was
leading
and
in
fear
of
it
rose
and
walked
away
suddenly
silent
well
he
heard
her
saying
i
don
t
think
you
are
was
she
laughing
at
him
he
turned
toward
her
again
but
the
back
of
her
dark
head
was
very
demure
he
approached
quite
close
near
enough
to
touch
her
but
she
held
the
to
her
lips
and
then
when
she
had
drunk
sprang
up
and
away
what
s
the
use
of
thinking
about
the
past
or
the
future
alanah
when
we
have
the
a
gorgeous
morning
and
happy
paris
just
at
our
elbows
you
shall
wash
the
and
the
pot
while
i
put
on
my
hat
for
there
s
nothing
like
sticking
something
into
a
man
s
hands
to
keep
them
out
of
mischief
and
then
we
ll
be
wandering
forth
you
and
i
into
the
realms
of
delight
he
was
glad
at
the
thought
of
going
out
into
the
air
away
from
the
studio
for
here
within
four
walls
she
was
too
close
to
him
their
seclusion
too
intimate
if
he
only
were
harry
he
would
have
taken
her
tantalizing
moods
as
a
husband
might
and
conquered
her
by
strength
and
tenderness
but
as
it
was
all
he
could
feel
beside
tenderness
was
pity
for
her
innocence
and
helplessness
and
contempt
and
not
a
little
pity
for
himself
but
the
air
of
was
to
restore
him
to
sanity
it
was
one
of
those
late
november
days
of
sunshine
warm
and
hazy
when
outer
wraps
are
superfluous
and
arm
in
arm
like
two
good
comrades
and
as
the
custom
was
in
the
they
sauntered
forth
in
the
direction
she
indicated
there
were
to
be
no
vehicles
for
them
she
insisted
for
cost
much
and
money
was
scarce
life
seemed
to
be
coursing
very
strongly
through
her
veins
and
the
more
he
felt
the
contagion
of
her
youth
and
joy
the
more
trying
became
the
task
he
had
set
himself
but
sober
though
he
was
within
he
could
not
resist
the
spell
of
her
enthusiasms
and
he
put
the
evil
hour
from
him
this
day
at
least
should
be
hers
as
nearly
as
he
could
make
it
without
a
flaw
they
turned
down
the
boul
miche
and
into
the
boulevard
germain
past
the
beaux
arts
which
she
wished
to
show
him
then
over
the
pont
des
arts
to
the
right
bank
they
stopped
on
the
quai
for
a
moment
to
gaze
down
toward
the
towers
of
notre
dame
while
moira
painted
for
him
the
glories
that
were
france
he
had
lived
a
busy
life
and
had
had
little
time
for
the
romances
of
great
nations
but
he
remembered
what
he
had
read
and
through
moira
s
clear
intelligence
the
epic
filtered
tinctured
with
its
color
and
idealism
illustration
through
moira
s
clear
intelligence
the
epic
filtered
then
under
the
arches
of
the
louvre
to
the
avenue
de
l
opera
and
toward
the
banking
district
all
paris
smiled
the
blue
and
brown
mingled
fraternally
and
the
streets
were
crowded
except
for
the
uniforms
which
were
seen
everywhere
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
hardly
a
month
ago
the
most
terrible
war
in
history
had
been
fought
almost
at
the
city
s
gates
when
he
reached
his
bank
which
was
in
the
boulevard
des
italiens
near
the
jim
horton
had
to
move
with
caution
but
moira
fortunately
had
some
shopping
to
do
and
in
her
absence
he
contrived
to
get
some
checks
and
going
into
the
grand
hotel
drew
a
check
signed
with
his
own
name
and
payable
to
henry
horton
and
this
he
presented
for
payment
there
was
some
delay
and
a
few
questions
for
the
amount
was
thousand
he
showed
the
letters
from
moira
and
quinlevin
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
he
went
out
and
met
moira
near
the
with
a
grin
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
exhibiting
a
large
packet
of
and
led
the
way
down
the
avenue
by
which
they
had
come
and
where
now
harry
dear
i
m
hungry
to
the
most
expensive
restaurant
in
paris
for
if
i
m
not
mistaken
we
passed
it
just
here
but
you
must
won
t
he
only
grinned
and
led
her
inside
for
at
least
moira
we
shall
live
but
to
see
paris
that
is
not
to
we
shall
see
the
tempting
meal
that
he
ordered
with
her
assistance
did
much
to
mollify
her
prudence
and
frugality
and
they
breakfasted
in
state
on
the
best
that
the
market
provided
afternoon
found
them
back
in
the
boulevard
germain
again
after
an
eventful
interim
which
jim
horton
had
filled
above
her
protests
in
a
drive
through
the
and
a
visit
much
less
expensive
to
a
show
during
which
she
held
his
hand
and
now
a
little
weary
of
all
the
world
but
happy
in
each
other
they
drifted
like
the
flotsam
of
all
lovers
of
the
toward
the
gardens
of
the
luxembourg
they
sat
side
by
side
on
the
balustrade
overlooking
the
esplanade
and
lawn
in
front
of
the
palace
watching
the
always
paired
and
milliner
workman
and
and
for
the
warm
weather
had
brought
them
out
there
was
no
military
band
playing
but
they
needed
no
music
in
their
hearts
which
were
already
beating
in
time
to
the
most
exquisite
of
interludes
twilight
was
falling
the
paris
dusk
full
of
mystery
and
elusive
charm
lights
beyond
the
trees
flickered
into
being
and
the
roar
of
the
city
beyond
their
diminished
into
a
low
murmur
for
a
while
their
conversation
had
relapsed
into
short
sentences
and
monosyllables
as
though
the
gayety
of
their
talk
was
no
longer
sufficient
to
conceal
their
thoughts
which
throwing
off
subterfuge
spoke
in
the
silences
at
last
moira
shivered
slightly
and
rose
come
she
said
gently
we
must
be
going
and
led
the
way
toward
the
exit
from
the
gardens
on
the
boulevard
michel
horton
followed
for
the
end
of
his
perfect
day
was
drawing
near
and
with
it
the
duty
which
was
to
bring
disillusionment
and
distress
to
moira
and
ostracism
and
hell
to
him
but
when
they
reached
the
studio
moira
set
with
alacrity
at
putting
things
to
rights
and
preparing
the
evening
meal
we
shall
be
having
cold
goose
and
a
bit
of
salad
you
extravagant
person
she
said
i
feel
as
though
i
had
no
right
to
be
eating
again
for
a
week
and
so
they
dined
upon
the
remains
of
their
feast
but
warmed
by
the
cheerful
blaze
both
conscious
of
the
imminent
hour
of
seclusion
and
affinity
moira
had
little
to
say
and
in
the
silences
jim
caught
her
gaze
upon
him
once
or
twice
as
though
in
inquiry
or
incomprehension
and
wondered
whether
in
their
long
day
together
he
had
said
or
done
anything
which
might
have
led
her
to
suspect
the
truth
but
he
had
been
cautious
following
her
leads
in
conversation
and
playing
his
discreditable
role
with
rather
creditable
skill
the
end
was
near
he
would
see
harry
at
javet
s
and
he
would
tell
her
but
it
was
like
the
thought
of
death
to
he
failed
to
hide
from
her
the
traces
of
his
misery
i
wish
that
you
would
tell
me
what
worries
you
she
said
gently
after
a
long
silence
he
started
forward
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
he
stammered
there
s
nothing
yes
there
is
she
said
evenly
i
know
i
ve
felt
it
all
when
you
seemed
most
happy
and
then
quickly
is
it
me
that
you
re
worrying
about
about
you
he
asked
to
gain
time
and
then
grasping
at
the
straw
she
threw
him
he
said
quietly
it
was
the
first
definite
return
to
the
topic
of
the
morning
which
they
had
both
banished
as
though
by
an
understanding
but
moira
was
persistent
why
she
asked
i
don
t
you
she
smiled
softly
from
her
chair
nearby
don
t
you
think
i
m
the
best
judge
of
that
no
he
said
miserably
no
you
can
t
deny
a
woman
the
faith
of
her
intuitions
and
if
i
proved
your
intuitions
sure
and
i
d
never
speak
to
you
again
she
put
in
quaintly
it
might
be
better
if
you
didn
t
he
muttered
half
aloud
she
heard
him
or
seemed
to
for
she
turned
quickly
and
laid
her
hand
over
his
don
t
be
spoiling
our
day
dear
she
said
earnestly
god
has
been
good
in
bringing
you
back
to
me
whatever
happens
i
won
t
be
regretting
it
his
fingers
caught
and
pressed
hers
and
then
quickly
relinquished
them
as
he
rose
struggling
for
his
composure
you
regret
it
he
said
fiercely
i
tell
you
you
can
t
thank
god
for
me
because
i
m
not
what
you
want
to
think
me
i
m
what
the
harry
you
knew
in
america
was
only
liar
a
he
paused
as
she
rose
saving
himself
the
revelation
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
by
the
sight
of
her
face
in
the
firelight
as
she
turned
it
was
transfigured
by
her
new
faith
in
him
and
in
her
joy
in
the
possession
she
came
to
him
quickly
and
put
her
soft
fingers
over
his
lips
while
the
other
arm
went
around
his
shoulders
hush
alanah
she
said
mustn
t
moira
he
muttered
taking
her
hands
down
and
clasping
them
both
in
his
you
mustn
t
and
then
at
the
look
of
disappointment
that
came
into
her
eyes
caught
both
her
hands
to
his
lips
and
covered
them
with
kisses
against
the
sweet
allure
of
her
he
struggled
sure
that
never
mortal
man
had
been
so
tried
before
but
surer
still
that
the
love
he
bore
for
her
was
greater
than
all
temptation
she
looked
at
him
flushed
at
the
warmth
of
this
formal
caress
which
left
no
doubt
of
him
but
marveling
at
his
renunciation
of
her
lips
which
had
been
so
near
i
can
t
be
listening
when
you
call
yourself
such
names
you
don
t
i
can
t
tell
more
just
now
i
haven
will
he
noted
the
look
of
alarm
which
was
a
token
of
the
suffering
he
must
cause
her
and
he
led
her
to
his
chair
and
made
her
sit
i
can
t
make
you
m
sorry
you
read
my
thoughts
i
shouldn
t
have
let
you
see
he
had
turned
to
the
fire
and
leaned
against
the
chimney
piece
and
after
a
moment
clear
and
very
tender
he
heard
her
voice
you
must
tell
me
everything
alanah
i
ve
got
the
right
to
it
now
he
shook
his
head
in
silent
misery
but
you
must
no
i
can
t
yes
you
see
things
are
different
with
us
two
you
ve
made
me
know
how
different
last
night
i
called
to
your
mind
the
mockery
we
d
been
through
calling
it
marriage
but
it
a
marriage
and
the
dear
god
has
willed
that
my
heart
should
beat
for
you
as
gently
as
that
of
any
mother
for
its
babe
it
softened
in
the
hospital
dear
when
i
saw
you
lying
there
so
pale
and
weak
against
the
pillows
and
i
knew
that
if
god
spared
you
for
me
i
would
make
he
gasped
by
giving
you
all
that
i
had
of
faith
hope
and
charity
whatever
you
were
whatever
you
are
dear
you
re
mine
for
better
or
for
worse
and
i
believe
in
you
and
your
troubles
whatever
they
ll
take
my
half
of
them
you
can
he
groaned
not
if
they
concern
me
she
continued
simply
for
they
re
mine
already
he
took
a
pace
or
two
away
from
her
you
mustn
t
speak
to
me
like
this
and
why
not
you
re
mine
to
speak
to
as
i
please
is
it
that
you
don
t
love
me
enough
alanah
he
knew
that
she
wouldn
t
have
asked
that
question
if
she
hadn
t
already
seen
the
answer
in
his
eyes
love
he
began
his
eyes
shining
like
stars
and
then
suddenly
as
though
their
very
glow
had
burned
them
out
they
turned
away
dull
and
lusterless
she
watched
him
anxiously
for
a
moment
and
then
rose
and
faced
him
she
said
softly
i
m
waiting
for
your
answer
can
t
give
you
an
answer
he
said
in
a
colorless
voice
then
i
ll
be
giving
the
answer
for
you
my
dear
for
i
m
not
without
eyes
in
my
head
i
know
you
love
me
and
i
ve
been
knowing
it
for
many
days
and
it
s
the
kind
of
love
that
a
woman
wants
the
love
that
gives
and
asks
nothing
she
paused
breathing
with
difficulty
the
warm
color
rising
to
her
temples
and
then
went
on
gently
proudly
as
though
in
joy
of
her
confession
and
is
the
same
with
me
i
ve
tried
to
make
you
understand
it
is
not
for
you
to
give
only
she
halted
in
her
speech
a
moment
and
then
came
close
to
him
her
clear
gaze
seeking
his
i
love
you
not
for
what
you
have
suffered
she
whispered
but
for
what
you
are
to
because
you
are
my
husband
but
because
you
are
only
one
in
all
the
world
for
me
moira
he
whispered
tensely
as
his
arms
went
about
her
god
forgive
worship
you
god
will
forgive
you
that
alanah
he
heard
her
say
happily
since
i
do
he
touched
his
lips
to
her
brow
tenderly
then
her
lips
you
love
me
he
muttered
you
re
sure
that
it
s
that
you
love
her
eyes
opened
startled
at
his
tone
if
it
isn
t
you
that
i
love
then
i
m
sure
that
i
can
t
be
loving
any
one
at
all
and
you
ll
believe
in
happens
i
she
repeated
proudly
whatever
has
happened
to
us
both
some
ll
know
he
muttered
painfully
that
m
not
what
i
seem
to
be
and
then
i
want
you
to
remember
this
hour
this
moment
moira
as
it
is
to
me
i
want
you
to
remember
how
you
came
into
my
arms
when
i
hadn
t
the
strength
to
repel
you
remember
the
touch
of
my
lips
in
in
that
love
was
too
strong
for
me
for
it
has
made
me
false
to
myself
false
to
you
she
drew
away
from
him
a
little
deeply
perturbed
you
frighten
me
alanah
don
t
want
to
he
paused
searching
for
strength
to
speak
but
it
did
not
come
what
do
you
mean
the
repetition
of
the
word
seemed
like
a
confirmation
of
his
resolution
and
shocked
him
into
action
quietly
he
took
her
hands
down
from
his
shoulders
kissed
them
in
farewell
and
turned
away
what
do
you
mean
she
repeated
shall
judge
me
the
tense
expression
of
her
anxiety
relaxed
and
she
smiled
you
needn
t
fear
what
that
will
be
he
did
not
reply
but
stood
staring
fixedly
into
the
fire
she
came
around
to
him
and
laid
her
fingers
over
his
why
should
we
bother
about
dear
was
yesterday
s
and
see
what
s
happened
to
us
but
it
shouldn
t
have
happened
he
groaned
it
shouldn
t
have
happened
then
why
should
i
thank
god
for
don
yes
everything
will
be
right
a
woman
knows
of
these
things
he
smiled
at
her
tenderly
but
he
didn
t
attempt
to
take
her
in
his
arms
come
she
said
let
us
sit
down
by
the
fire
near
the
blaze
and
we
will
not
speak
of
of
and
yesterday
and
the
day
before
when
you
and
i
were
learning
this
wonderful
thing
but
he
did
not
dare
moira
ve
got
to
go
out
for
matter
of
now
she
faltered
i
must
an
engagement
i
m
in
honor
now
really
alarmed
she
caught
him
by
the
elbows
and
looked
into
his
eyes
an
and
his
meaning
seemed
to
come
to
her
with
a
rush
this
engagement
has
something
to
do
with
me
what
is
it
harry
speak
i
can
t
i
ve
promised
i
won
t
let
you
go
harry
it
is
something
that
has
come
between
it
has
always
he
muttered
she
clung
to
him
and
held
him
as
he
moved
toward
the
door
shall
come
between
us
nothing
can
i
don
t
care
what
it
is
until
death
us
do
part
t
you
understand
what
that
means
harry
the
repetition
of
his
brother
s
name
the
phrase
from
the
marriage
service
gave
him
resolution
to
avert
his
face
from
the
piteous
pleading
in
her
eyes
it
is
because
i
understand
what
it
means
that
i
courage
to
you
despise
me
i
have
said
that
nothing
makes
any
difference
i
swear
it
i
love
you
dear
there
s
some
mistake
you
ll
never
be
different
in
my
eyes
whatever
has
happened
moira
he
whispered
his
hands
clasping
her
arms
no
no
not
i
knew
that
was
too
beautiful
to
last
ve
frightened
me
don
t
don
t
go
yes
he
said
firmly
i
must
but
she
was
strong
and
greater
than
her
strength
was
her
tenderness
look
me
in
the
eyes
dear
while
i
m
pleading
with
you
if
your
love
were
as
great
a
thing
as
to
look
in
her
eyes
he
knew
was
fatal
one
brief
struggle
and
then
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
close
for
a
long
moment
while
he
whispered
in
broken
sentences
my
love
if
you
hadn
t
said
that
you
ve
to
know
what
my
love
means
sacrifice
this
moment
is
mine
remember
it
it
is
its
terrible
that
too
because
that
s
the
essence
of
it
sanctity
god
bless
you
whatever
happens
as
in
a
daze
he
straightened
and
looked
around
then
almost
roughly
broke
away
from
her
and
rushed
to
the
door
taking
up
his
cap
and
overcoat
on
the
way
he
called
hoarsely
as
he
opened
the
door
and
went
out
she
rushed
after
him
but
he
was
already
running
furiously
down
the
stairs
into
the
dark
harry
she
called
back
but
the
name
of
his
brother
made
him
rush
on
the
more
blindly
the
echoes
following
him
down
into
the
court
and
past
the
open
gate
of
madame
toupin
he
hadn
t
any
definite
idea
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
the
only
thing
that
he
was
sure
of
was
that
he
must
get
from
moira
from
the
reproach
of
her
innocent
eyes
of
her
confessions
of
her
tributes
of
submission
and
surrender
on
he
plunged
blindly
down
the
street
toward
the
luxembourg
gardens
into
the
outer
darkness
where
he
must
lose
himself
away
from
all
time
he
had
failed
he
had
trusted
himself
too
her
too
far
fool
that
he
was
not
to
have
seen
that
love
begun
by
trivial
happenings
had
been
gathering
strength
and
momentum
and
like
an
avalanche
had
swept
down
and
engulfed
them
both
in
a
moment
of
reaction
of
guilty
triumph
he
rejoiced
defiant
of
the
conscience
that
drove
him
forth
that
it
was
him
that
she
harry
his
lips
that
had
taken
ears
that
had
received
her
confessions
meant
for
them
alone
but
reason
returned
after
awhile
and
with
it
the
sense
of
his
dishonor
the
thing
was
over
definitely
there
would
be
scorn
enough
in
her
eyes
for
him
when
he
told
her
all
the
truth
he
comforted
himself
with
that
thought
and
yet
it
brought
him
a
pang
too
for
he
knew
that
it
was
moira
who
was
to
suffer
most
he
seemed
to
be
the
only
person
in
the
gardens
for
the
night
was
chill
and
a
thin
mist
of
rain
was
falling
from
time
to
time
there
were
footsteps
here
and
there
and
the
murmur
of
voices
and
through
the
turmoil
of
his
thoughts
he
was
conscious
of
them
vaguely
but
they
meant
nothing
to
him
he
went
on
into
the
darkness
his
head
bowed
in
the
conflict
of
his
happiness
and
his
remorse
reaching
a
dimly
lighted
spot
near
the
rue
d
assas
when
he
heard
quick
footsteps
behind
him
he
turned
just
in
time
to
dodge
the
blow
of
a
stick
aimed
at
his
head
which
fell
heavily
on
his
shoulder
he
struck
out
but
another
man
caught
him
around
the
waist
bearing
him
to
the
ground
he
struggled
to
one
knee
striking
viciously
but
they
were
too
many
for
him
he
got
a
glimpse
of
an
automatic
pistol
which
flashed
before
his
eyes
and
then
something
heavy
struck
him
on
the
head
the
last
thing
he
noted
before
losing
consciousness
was
the
pale
face
of
the
man
with
the
automatic
it
was
his
moira
moved
about
in
a
daze
attempting
in
the
commonplaces
of
the
daily
routine
to
forget
the
thought
of
the
revelation
which
she
knew
could
not
be
long
delayed
she
had
lain
all
night
on
the
divan
in
the
studio
listening
and
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
soldier
and
at
last
toward
daylight
from
sheer
exhaustion
of
mind
and
body
had
fallen
asleep
when
she
awoke
her
first
impulse
was
to
go
to
the
room
in
the
hallway
and
knock
she
opened
the
door
the
bed
had
not
been
occupied
slowly
thoughtfully
she
went
back
to
the
studio
and
the
business
of
preparing
the
for
he
should
arrive
her
mind
was
filled
with
strange
doubts
of
him
because
she
had
learned
to
have
a
complete
a
perfect
faith
in
this
soldier
that
she
had
married
who
had
left
new
york
under
a
cloud
of
uncertainties
and
suspicions
and
had
come
back
to
her
spiritually
reborn
the
doubts
in
her
mind
were
those
that
he
had
purposely
created
in
it
and
fragments
of
phrases
that
he
had
uttered
in
their
moments
of
tenderness
came
back
to
alarm
and
disturb
her
because
if
he
hadn
t
thought
it
necessary
to
alarm
and
disturb
her
he
would
have
remained
silent
and
permitted
himself
to
enjoy
with
her
the
hours
that
had
been
theirs
together
yes
there
was
something
that
had
come
to
thrust
itself
between
impediment
to
their
union
she
smiled
softly
at
the
memory
of
the
restraint
in
his
caresses
the
purity
of
his
smile
and
the
gentleness
of
his
abnegation
he
had
underestimated
the
quality
of
her
new
faith
in
him
was
this
shadow
out
of
the
past
perhaps
but
it
wouldn
t
matter
together
they
would
exorcise
it
only
the
future
mattered
future
together
she
stopped
for
a
moment
in
her
work
of
putting
the
studio
to
rights
and
listened
she
thought
that
she
heard
a
step
upon
the
stair
she
waited
a
while
and
then
went
to
the
door
and
peered
out
no
one
it
a
little
cruel
that
he
had
not
sent
her
a
note
a
even
telling
when
she
must
expect
him
whatever
his
appearance
might
bring
for
this
she
realized
was
the
of
which
he
had
spoken
yesterday
the
day
of
revelations
she
tried
to
sing
at
her
work
but
the
effort
was
a
failure
a
morbid
fear
of
the
thing
that
was
to
happen
if
it
hadn
t
already
happened
obsessed
and
held
her
o
with
a
courage
born
of
desperation
she
went
into
her
room
and
put
on
her
hat
it
was
insupportable
the
suspense
there
were
some
things
to
buy
she
must
order
them
and
leaving
word
with
madame
toupin
that
she
would
return
within
the
hour
she
walked
briskly
forth
breasting
the
keen
air
and
trying
to
smile
but
even
her
walk
was
a
failure
and
in
a
short
while
she
was
back
eagerly
questioning
madame
toupin
no
monsieur
le
lieutenant
had
not
arrived
no
doubt
he
was
busy
about
the
ceremony
of
the
presentation
of
the
medals
moira
inquired
and
madame
toupin
showed
her
an
article
in
the
paper
about
the
honors
to
be
given
both
french
and
american
officers
next
week
in
the
place
de
la
concord
there
was
his
name
henry
de
guerre
madame
toupin
let
her
have
the
paper
and
she
ran
up
to
the
studio
where
she
read
it
eagerly
thrilling
with
pride
of
course
he
had
his
reasons
for
not
coming
to
her
and
telling
her
everything
she
must
be
faith
in
him
unwavering
he
would
come
to
her
whatever
he
told
her
was
to
make
no
difference
in
her
love
and
faith
in
he
told
swore
it
late
that
night
he
came
she
had
built
a
fire
of
fagots
against
the
chill
of
the
night
and
was
sitting
in
the
big
armchair
by
the
hearth
when
she
heard
a
knock
at
the
studio
door
with
a
cry
of
welcome
she
rose
and
rushed
to
greet
him
throwing
herself
impulsively
into
his
arms
harry
she
gasped
happily
at
last
she
couldn
t
help
noting
the
slight
movement
of
recoil
before
her
tenderness
then
bending
his
head
hello
moira
he
muttered
she
helped
him
off
with
his
overcoat
and
led
him
over
to
the
fire
making
him
sit
in
the
big
he
obeyed
awkwardly
as
one
in
a
daze
his
brows
frowning
the
light
was
uncertain
but
what
she
saw
alarmed
her
harry
what
has
happened
to
you
she
cried
catching
him
by
the
hands
and
holding
them
you
re
fingers
are
look
as
what
has
happened
nothing
he
murmured
with
an
attempt
at
a
smile
nothing
at
all
but
even
the
smile
was
different
as
though
the
muscles
acted
in
obedience
to
an
effort
she
had
struck
a
match
to
make
a
light
are
you
doing
he
asked
i
m
going
to
see
what
s
the
matter
with
you
you
look
sick
you
need
medicine
no
he
protested
i
m
just
tired
a
drink
of
whisky
if
you
ve
got
she
went
into
barry
quinlevin
s
room
and
brought
forth
a
bottle
a
glass
and
a
pitcher
of
water
with
a
hand
that
trembled
a
little
he
poured
himself
a
drink
and
took
it
at
a
draught
and
then
gave
a
gasp
of
relief
she
had
sat
down
near
him
and
was
regarding
him
with
an
expression
of
intentness
and
eagerness
though
the
pucker
at
her
brows
indicated
a
doubt
and
a
fear
the
gas
light
was
at
his
back
and
she
could
not
clearly
see
his
face
but
there
was
something
strange
about
him
that
she
had
missed
at
his
first
entrance
a
brooding
sullenness
remote
that
even
the
smile
could
not
temper
with
sweetness
and
even
while
she
watched
he
poured
out
another
glass
of
whisky
what
is
it
harry
she
asked
tell
me
it
s
nothing
he
said
i
m
all
in
i
ve
had
some
worries
i
ll
be
all
have
you
had
something
to
eat
yes
i
m
not
hungry
his
voice
too
thin
weary
somber
now
greatly
alarmed
she
caught
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
you
must
tell
me
everything
harry
i
don
t
care
what
it
ve
got
to
know
you
told
me
that
you
d
tell
me
and
now
you
must
keep
your
promise
i
ve
tried
so
hard
not
to
worry
when
you
didn
t
come
back
to
me
last
night
was
really
were
you
he
said
with
a
frown
i
was
all
right
i
m
glad
but
it
was
cruel
of
you
not
to
send
me
a
message
i
couldn
t
but
i
m
here
now
moira
so
there
s
no
need
worrying
any
more
he
put
his
hand
over
hers
and
leaned
toward
her
his
words
which
last
night
would
have
given
her
happiness
seemed
somehow
to
mean
nothing
to
her
for
his
very
presence
in
this
condition
was
a
threat
against
her
peace
of
mind
and
his
fingers
might
have
been
wax
for
all
that
their
touch
meant
to
her
re
trying
to
make
things
seem
better
than
they
are
she
said
steadily
wondering
at
her
own
words
m
not
easily
deceived
last
night
i
knew
that
something
had
come
between
us
i
know
now
that
it
s
still
between
us
harry
whatever
you
say
he
turned
away
toward
the
glass
at
his
elbow
no
he
murmured
that
been
removed
he
couldn
t
repress
the
smile
of
triumph
as
he
took
his
drink
and
she
saw
it
it
wasn
t
a
pleasant
smile
come
he
went
on
more
easily
aren
t
you
glad
to
see
me
knows
whether
i
am
or
not
something
has
happened
to
me
you
ve
been
through
something
that
has
burnt
the
soul
of
you
what
is
it
what
is
it
the
touch
of
your
voice
they
come
from
a
with
nothing
of
you
in
them
am
i
ill
that
i
should
be
thinking
of
you
so
take
me
in
your
arms
harry
and
shield
me
from
this
terror
that
you
re
not
yourself
but
some
one
else
he
obeyed
putting
his
arms
around
her
and
holding
her
close
to
him
but
at
the
touch
of
his
lips
to
hers
she
struggled
free
and
faced
him
by
the
hearth
pale
as
death
the
look
of
bewilderment
at
her
brows
had
intensified
into
a
steady
gaze
almost
of
terror
at
the
thought
that
had
suddenly
mastered
her
and
yet
she
did
not
dare
give
utterance
to
it
it
was
so
outlandish
so
mad
and
incomprehensible
she
saw
the
frown
of
anger
quickly
masked
in
a
smile
of
patience
as
she
broke
away
from
him
and
that
confirmed
her
in
her
madness
she
was
reading
him
keenly
now
from
top
to
toe
missing
nothing
and
the
thought
that
dominated
her
was
that
the
man
with
whom
she
had
mated
during
the
past
weeks
the
man
who
had
passed
through
the
shadow
of
death
reborn
in
body
and
spirit
the
harry
that
she
had
recently
learned
to
dead
and
that
this
man
who
had
come
to
take
his
what
he
might
have
been
if
god
s
grace
had
not
fallen
on
him
madness
perhaps
and
yet
how
otherwise
would
the
touch
of
his
lips
which
last
night
she
had
sought
in
tenderness
have
been
so
repellent
to
her
same
harry
that
she
kept
her
gaze
fixed
upon
him
and
she
saw
his
look
flicker
and
fade
if
this
reality
was
harry
her
husband
then
were
all
the
weeks
that
had
passed
since
she
found
him
in
the
hospital
merely
a
dream
was
yesterday
a
night
don
t
is
the
matter
she
said
at
last
passing
a
hand
across
her
brows
am
not
well
perhaps
but
re
not
the
same
i
know
it
the
thoughts
that
i
have
of
you
frighten
me
he
forced
a
laugh
and
sank
into
his
chair
again
lighting
a
cigarette
with
an
assumption
of
ease
i
m
sorry
he
said
quietly
she
only
stood
staring
at
him
her
deep
blue
eyes
never
wavering
from
his
face
which
was
still
averted
from
the
light
he
met
that
gaze
second
time
and
then
looked
away
but
still
they
stared
at
him
wide
like
a
child
s
but
full
of
a
dawning
wisdom
are
harry
husband
she
whispered
in
a
kind
of
daze
well
rather
she
paused
another
long
moment
as
though
on
the
verge
of
a
difficult
decision
and
then
spoke
searchingly
if
you
are
is
the
harry
horton
started
the
the
was
here
with
me
yesterday
who
was
ill
in
the
hospital
at
neuilly
hero
of
boissi√®re
wood
moira
he
said
rising
this
is
serious
there
has
been
no
other
here
yes
she
repeated
doggedly
the
other
has
been
the
word
seemed
born
of
her
necessity
your
twin
she
repeated
he
winced
at
the
word
and
she
saw
the
change
in
his
expression
tell
me
the
truth
of
this
thing
she
went
on
quickly
said
yesterday
that
something
was
to
come
between
us
it
was
and
then
as
he
made
no
reply
for
god
s
sake
he
turned
away
from
the
light
i
m
your
husband
he
muttered
hoarsely
show
me
your
wounds
she
gasped
suddenly
reasoning
with
singular
directness
he
glanced
at
her
once
then
bent
forward
there
upon
the
left
side
of
his
head
in
a
shaved
spot
was
a
cross
of
adhesive
tape
she
touched
it
aimlessly
with
her
fingers
and
then
suddenly
before
he
could
rise
with
a
quick
deft
movement
tore
it
away
from
his
skull
and
quickly
as
he
straightened
she
had
seen
enough
there
was
no
wound
what
s
this
deviltry
he
muttered
his
face
an
angry
red
but
the
look
that
he
met
in
her
eyes
pierced
all
subterfuge
you
have
not
been
wounded
she
gasped
he
leaned
forward
in
his
fury
as
though
to
strike
her
but
she
stood
up
to
him
resolutely
until
the
color
faded
from
his
face
and
he
straightened
slowly
well
he
muttered
with
a
shrug
i
haven
t
and
then
folding
his
arms
he
found
her
gaze
what
of
it
he
asked
shortly
she
glanced
down
at
the
slips
of
adhesive
tape
and
then
let
them
fall
through
her
fingers
i
m
glad
she
said
coolly
that
you
ve
decided
not
to
carry
on
the
he
laughed
again
well
it
looks
as
though
it
were
hardly
worth
while
already
all
her
thoughts
were
beyond
him
is
the
other
she
asked
at
last
with
a
cold
precision
that
might
have
come
from
a
disembodied
spirit
he
waited
a
moment
before
replying
and
then
his
tone
matched
her
own
i
can
hardly
wonder
at
your
interest
after
the
warmth
of
your
greeting
when
i
came
in
the
shot
told
and
she
colored
painfully
is
he
she
repeated
with
an
effort
he
smiled
there
s
no
harm
in
your
knowing
since
you
ve
guessed
the
rest
he
s
my
twin
brother
jim
horton
jim
she
gasped
below
her
breath
we
met
in
the
confusion
on
the
battlefield
he
went
on
i
had
been
and
he
put
on
my
uniform
to
lead
my
yes
he
took
my
uniform
it
was
a
fool
proceeding
when
i
came
to
everything
was
in
confusion
he
would
have
been
courtmartialed
and
shot
if
i
had
turned
up
so
i
went
back
to
the
lines
and
came
to
while
he
won
you
the
croix
de
guerre
and
you
re
going
to
step
into
his
they
re
shoes
it
s
not
my
and
s
to
become
of
him
that
s
his
lookout
he
merely
disappears
from
the
scene
she
leaned
heavily
against
the
mantel
shelf
breathing
fast
but
she
had
no
reply
and
so
he
went
on
unpleasantly
now
perhaps
you
would
like
to
explain
i
have
nothing
to
explain
not
the
joy
in
your
eyes
when
i
came
in
the
kisses
you
gave
me
that
you
thought
were
for
him
i
ask
no
forgiveness
she
said
in
a
hollow
tone
of
course
you
thought
he
was
your
husband
and
he
let
you
think
so
yes
he
let
me
think
so
she
repeated
and
all
the
while
her
horror
of
her
situation
anger
at
the
other
who
had
dared
to
place
her
in
this
false
position
she
saw
her
husband
s
bony
fingers
clasp
the
chair
arm
you
were
easily
deceived
he
went
on
it
s
hardly
flattering
to
me
i
would
like
to
he
stopped
suddenly
his
question
in
abeyance
before
the
challenge
in
her
eyes
aroused
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
she
read
his
thought
and
answered
him
he
came
here
from
the
hospital
night
before
last
he
wanted
to
go
to
a
but
i
would
not
permit
that
was
kind
of
you
but
i
m
not
blind
and
your
kisses
for
him
were
warm
on
your
lips
when
you
greeted
me
she
paled
and
drooped
in
her
shame
what
have
you
to
say
about
that
he
went
on
tensely
do
you
think
that
i
m
the
kind
to
stand
by
idly
and
see
a
man
take
my
wife
s
kisses
no
you
re
not
she
answered
slowly
you
ve
already
answered
me
and
then
with
a
painful
effort
what
have
you
done
with
him
he
sank
into
the
armchair
with
a
laugh
with
nothing
he
has
gone
that
s
all
i
don
t
believe
you
that
s
your
privilege
he
has
gone
he
thought
he
had
gone
about
far
enough
and
i
m
almost
ready
to
believe
that
you
agree
with
him
no
she
stammered
pleading
against
her
own
will
against
her
outraged
pride
there
was
a
reason
for
what
he
honorable
reason
there
must
have
been
the
marks
of
it
are
not
very
clear
to
me
if
you
can
see
anything
honorable
in
trying
to
steal
the
love
of
one
s
brother
s
he
paused
for
he
saw
the
danger
signals
flying
in
her
eyes
and
tried
to
shrug
his
anger
off
what
s
the
use
i
m
no
fool
whether
he
tried
to
win
you
or
not
it
s
clear
that
neither
of
you
was
about
me
she
didn
t
reply
at
once
and
when
she
did
speak
her
words
came
slowly
and
with
dignity
i
don
t
know
why
it
is
that
he
should
have
kept
silent
about
you
he
has
done
me
a
when
i
visited
him
in
the
hospital
it
was
that
i
visited
that
i
went
to
cheer
to
take
my
place
by
your
side
i
thanked
god
when
i
saw
you
that
you
had
grown
to
you
were
what
i
had
wanted
you
to
be
and
i
loved
you
for
what
you
had
suffered
he
started
up
from
his
chair
wait
a
moment
she
insisted
still
struggling
to
give
her
thoughts
expression
i
want
you
to
understand
i
thought
that
it
was
you
who
had
come
back
to
i
wished
you
to
come
honor
and
pride
of
your
service
of
your
country
and
instead
of
you
i
your
wounds
your
it
was
your
spite
of
the
false
position
he
s
placed
me
honor
him
for
those
wounds
as
i
would
have
honored
i
honor
him
still
he
has
thought
enough
of
his
honor
and
of
give
up
everything
that
he
has
won
and
gone
out
into
the
at
this
harry
horton
s
fury
relaxed
in
a
laugh
he
poured
himself
out
another
drink
you
can
spare
him
these
new
honors
she
glanced
at
him
keenly
but
he
was
too
angry
to
notice
he
he
had
to
he
muttered
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
it
was
getting
too
hot
for
him
the
meaning
under
his
words
came
to
her
slowly
she
watched
him
for
a
moment
curiously
leaning
toward
him
studying
the
ugly
lines
at
lip
and
brow
that
he
no
longer
took
pains
to
conceal
and
then
she
guessed
at
the
truth
what
have
you
done
with
him
she
whispered
you
lie
she
knew
no
fear
of
him
now
and
leaned
forward
clutching
at
his
shoulder
you
ve
dealt
unfairly
with
she
halted
in
terror
of
her
thoughts
he
got
what
he
deserved
he
muttered
sullenly
what
have
you
done
she
repeated
put
him
where
he
won
t
mess
in
affairs
again
see
here
moira
he
caught
her
wrists
and
held
her
i
m
just
about
fed
up
with
this
i
ve
been
patient
about
long
enough
you
re
my
wife
and
i
m
going
to
keep
you
do
you
think
after
all
i
ve
suffered
i
m
going
to
stand
for
this
kind
of
treatment
now
let
go
my
re
hurting
instead
he
drew
her
closer
to
him
i
don
t
care
about
this
foolishness
with
jim
i
think
you
can
see
that
you
ve
made
a
fool
of
yourself
and
of
me
but
i
m
willing
to
forget
it
if
you
ll
do
the
square
thing
i
m
back
here
and
i
m
back
to
i
m
going
to
make
you
love
me
whether
you
want
to
or
not
let
me
go
harry
kiss
me
no
she
struggled
in
his
arms
but
he
only
held
her
the
more
closely
moira
i
want
you
you
re
mine
you
belong
to
me
by
every
but
he
mastered
her
pressing
her
throat
back
and
kissing
her
upon
the
lips
she
lay
quiet
in
his
arms
weak
from
the
struggle
he
took
her
immobility
for
acquiescence
and
caught
her
more
tightly
in
his
arms
let
me
go
she
gasped
do
you
hear
a
saner
man
would
have
caught
the
warning
note
but
harry
horton
was
beyond
warnings
she
fought
with
renewed
strength
and
then
all
else
failing
struck
him
full
in
the
face
with
her
clenched
fist
his
arms
relaxed
in
astonishment
and
she
sprang
away
putting
a
small
table
between
them
breathing
rapidly
she
saw
him
put
his
fingers
to
his
cheek
and
then
look
at
them
in
a
bewildered
way
i
see
she
heard
him
muttering
to
himself
so
that
s
the
way
of
the
blow
brought
him
to
his
senses
and
he
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
as
though
at
a
person
he
had
never
seen
before
her
eyes
burned
like
a
blue
flame
in
the
pallor
of
her
face
and
the
hand
that
clutched
the
table
trembled
violently
and
yet
it
was
not
the
fear
of
him
that
made
her
tremble
but
the
fear
of
herself
and
of
the
sudden
dreadful
awakening
at
the
edge
of
the
chasm
that
yawned
between
them
the
silence
seemed
endless
and
yet
she
dared
not
trust
herself
to
speak
her
throat
closed
and
it
seemed
that
the
blood
from
her
heart
was
drowning
her
and
yet
she
watched
him
tensely
aware
of
the
crisis
aware
too
of
the
revelations
that
seemed
to
have
laid
her
heart
bare
to
all
the
world
her
husband
reached
the
large
table
and
poured
out
what
remained
of
the
whisky
then
she
heard
his
laugh
again
and
saw
him
leering
at
her
over
his
glass
lucky
dog
i
am
pretty
little
devil
to
come
home
to
love
tap
he
shrugged
and
raised
his
glass
to
our
better
acquaintance
she
made
no
sound
but
while
her
eyes
watched
her
mind
was
working
rapidly
his
air
was
braggart
but
she
could
see
that
he
wasn
t
any
too
sure
of
himself
he
had
thought
to
come
here
and
by
the
ruse
of
the
adhesive
plaster
merge
his
identity
into
that
of
his
brother
jim
the
lapse
of
time
since
she
had
seen
him
and
the
illness
had
deceived
her
in
the
hospital
and
so
he
had
figured
on
the
remarkable
resemblance
to
his
brother
to
help
him
carry
off
this
situation
with
a
careless
hand
but
he
hadn
t
reckoned
with
the
alertness
of
her
woman
s
intuitions
help
tenderness
of
yesterday
which
held
the
image
of
the
brother
so
close
to
her
heart
something
of
what
was
passing
in
her
mind
seemed
to
come
to
him
so
you
ve
fallen
in
love
with
my
pretty
brother
he
muttered
no
complaisant
you
wanted
jim
to
take
you
in
his
you
only
had
you
don
t
care
for
my
kisses
why
not
we
re
just
like
as
two
peas
in
a
pod
what
s
the
difference
come
now
tell
me
i
ll
be
a
good
sport
ve
got
to
come
to
an
she
gasped
at
last
desperately
understanding
that
s
what
i
m
getting
he
laughed
and
sank
into
a
chair
by
the
lay
figure
oh
don
t
be
disturbed
i
m
not
going
to
try
to
kiss
you
again
it
s
too
dangerous
she
watched
him
intently
while
he
took
out
a
package
of
cigarettes
and
lighted
one
and
then
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
an
all
means
fire
away
it
isn
t
necessary
to
go
into
the
past
except
to
say
what
you
know
our
marriage
was
a
horrible
mistake
but
we
did
have
an
understanding
you
were
to
you
were
make
that
i
was
to
try
care
for
you
quite
so
and
we
ve
both
failed
thanks
have
both
failed
she
repeated
i
can
t
say
i
ever
really
believed
we
should
succeed
until
you
went
to
the
hospital
she
bent
her
head
the
main
thing
is
she
went
on
more
evenly
as
she
gathered
courage
that
whatever
my
hopes
were
for
you
now
at
least
you
ve
forfeited
all
claim
to
consideration
why
because
i
take
a
fancy
to
my
own
own
personality
because
she
paused
to
catch
her
breath
because
you
ve
stooped
to
vile
and
terrible
knows
to
get
rid
of
a
own
brother
did
you
a
service
and
because
you
ll
dare
to
receive
honors
that
don
t
belong
to
you
and
then
as
he
started
up
one
moment
i
don
t
know
what
happened
on
the
battlefield
if
you
were
injured
it
was
a
thing
jim
horton
did
for
you
but
whatever
he
did
and
whatever
his
motive
it
deserves
something
of
different
from
what
you
ve
confessed
tell
me
what
you
have
done
with
him
and
i
ll
try
to
believe
you
he
s
quit
i
told
you
he
protested
there
wasn
t
anything
else
for
where
is
he
what
does
it
matter
he
s
out
of
your
of
mine
out
of
your
she
paused
what
do
you
mean
merely
that
the
truth
of
this
thing
must
be
told
impossible
it
would
ruin
us
both
she
gave
a
little
gasp
of
relief
tell
me
where
he
is
he
s
she
deliberated
a
moment
you
ve
got
to
prove
it
to
me
he
said
he
was
coming
back
to
the
studio
instead
you
the
uniform
he
wore
he
didn
t
give
it
to
you
yes
he
lied
sullenly
he
gave
it
to
me
there
wasn
t
anything
else
to
do
when
i
turned
up
he
realized
he
couldn
t
stay
you
and
then
oh
he
was
square
enough
about
it
there
was
a
long
pause
he
didn
t
ring
true
she
had
almost
forgotten
as
he
had
what
he
had
said
in
the
fury
of
his
jealousy
she
was
aware
that
he
had
risen
unsteadily
from
his
chair
and
was
approaching
her
so
here
moira
he
said
in
an
ingratiating
tone
i
m
not
a
bad
i
m
not
was
out
of
my
head
awhile
way
you
came
up
to
me
thinking
i
was
him
i
guess
i
wanted
to
hurt
way
you
had
hurt
me
i
m
sorry
i
won
t
touch
your
fingers
even
if
you
don
t
want
me
to
i
was
a
rotter
to
try
to
kiss
you
i
ought
to
have
known
you
didn
t
want
me
had
had
one
or
two
too
many
i
ve
been
worried
worried
about
the
whole
thing
let
s
forget
it
and
talk
the
thing
over
sensibly
there
may
be
a
way
out
i
don
t
want
any
honors
that
don
t
belong
to
me
but
i
don
t
want
to
be
dismissed
from
the
service
either
or
jim
s
account
but
we
ve
got
to
keep
this
thing
quiet
she
understood
his
drift
the
facts
in
her
possession
made
her
dangerous
it
can
t
be
kept
quiet
so
long
as
jim
horton
is
in
danger
who
said
he
was
in
danger
i
said
he
d
but
you
lied
he
hasn
t
quit
he
isn
t
the
quitting
kind
he
was
to
have
come
to
me
and
told
me
the
didn
t
know
what
it
all
meant
then
but
i
do
now
he
has
got
to
have
his
chance
she
saw
him
glare
at
her
somberly
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
take
me
to
that
s
impossible
i
couldn
t
find
him
yes
you
can
find
him
or
he
would
have
found
me
he
smeared
out
the
ash
of
his
cigarette
in
a
receiver
and
rose
his
face
livid
you
seem
very
sure
of
of
yourself
and
if
i
don
t
find
him
for
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
shall
tell
what
i
know
to
the
proper
authorities
he
stood
for
a
moment
balked
and
then
before
she
knew
what
he
was
about
he
stumbled
to
the
studio
door
and
turning
the
key
in
the
lock
put
it
in
his
pocket
she
was
frightened
by
the
significance
of
the
action
and
ran
quickly
toward
the
door
of
her
own
room
he
turned
and
moved
to
intercept
her
but
awkwardly
and
she
slammed
the
door
in
his
face
catching
the
bolt
on
the
inside
she
was
frightened
now
desperately
frightened
but
resolved
to
escape
and
tell
what
she
knew
the
in
prisoner
he
would
have
come
to
her
much
as
his
silence
had
injured
her
deeply
as
her
pride
was
hurt
at
the
position
in
which
he
had
placed
her
she
knew
now
that
he
had
intended
to
tell
the
truth
from
his
own
lips
and
warn
her
of
harry
s
return
before
he
left
her
and
went
away
alone
he
loved
her
it
was
his
love
that
had
sought
to
spare
her
the
humiliation
of
this
very
knowledge
that
had
come
to
her
there
was
another
reason
for
the
substitution
what
but
whatever
it
was
there
seemed
little
difficulty
in
choosing
between
them
the
man
she
loved
she
acknowledged
it
in
every
impulse
would
have
come
to
her
she
had
to
find
him
just
what
she
meant
to
do
she
didn
t
know
except
to
get
away
from
harry
he
was
hammering
on
the
door
with
her
but
she
didn
t
answer
catching
up
her
hat
and
a
heavy
coat
she
went
quietly
to
her
own
door
into
the
hall
and
while
he
still
hammered
and
pleaded
fled
quickly
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
lodge
of
the
madame
toupin
aroused
suddenly
from
her
doze
started
up
in
amazement
madame
horton
what
is
it
she
asked
in
french
it
is
a
game
we
play
madame
toupin
you
shall
hide
me
in
your
closet
and
when
monsieur
le
lieutenant
comes
you
shall
say
that
i
have
run
out
into
the
street
you
understand
madame
ah
les
jeux
d
amour
entrez
and
she
opened
the
door
of
the
closet
which
moira
entered
quickly
then
madame
toupin
with
a
smile
of
wisdom
composed
herself
to
read
her
paper
and
in
a
moment
a
clatter
of
boots
upon
the
stairway
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
upon
the
paving
of
the
courtyard
announced
the
approach
of
the
officer
through
a
crack
in
the
door
moira
listened
to
the
conversation
which
madame
conducted
with
her
amiable
smile
and
presently
harry
horton
withdrew
frowning
and
went
out
hurriedly
into
the
rue
de
tavennes
but
while
she
stood
upright
in
the
closet
listening
moira
had
formulated
a
plan
it
was
clear
from
the
tone
of
harry
s
voice
and
his
haste
to
go
that
her
escape
had
frightened
him
for
his
judgment
was
not
amiss
when
he
decided
that
moira
was
fully
capable
of
carrying
out
her
threat
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
the
military
authorities
but
instead
of
clinging
to
her
original
intention
a
new
idea
had
come
to
her
if
she
followed
him
she
could
perhaps
get
a
clue
to
the
mystery
of
jim
horton
s
disappearance
she
couldn
t
understand
t
make
herself
believe
that
this
man
that
she
had
married
could
be
capable
of
a
thing
so
vile
but
the
own
words
stammered
in
his
fury
were
damning
the
familiar
formulas
seemed
to
have
no
bearing
now
the
war
had
made
men
or
devils
and
harry
it
did
not
seem
very
difficult
to
decide
what
harry
was
she
slipped
on
her
heavy
coat
and
the
hat
she
had
brought
and
with
a
word
of
explanation
and
caution
to
madame
toupin
she
went
out
into
the
street
far
down
upon
the
opposite
sidewalk
she
saw
a
tall
figure
striding
away
into
the
darkness
she
followed
keeping
at
a
distance
her
coat
collar
turned
up
and
her
hat
pushed
well
down
over
her
eyes
she
hurried
along
keeping
in
the
shadow
of
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
trembling
with
the
excitement
of
her
venture
and
wondering
what
was
to
be
its
outcome
but
sure
from
his
gait
that
the
situation
she
had
created
had
developed
in
harry
horton
s
hazy
brain
some
definite
plan
of
action
she
noticed
too
that
he
no
longer
swayed
or
stumbled
and
that
he
glanced
furtively
to
left
and
right
at
the
street
corners
peering
back
toward
her
from
time
to
time
but
she
matched
her
wits
to
his
crouching
into
corners
as
he
turned
and
then
running
forward
breathlessly
in
the
dark
places
keeping
him
in
sight
he
turned
into
the
narrow
reaches
of
the
de
monsieur
le
past
the
and
the
de
and
crossed
the
boulevard
germain
into
the
network
of
small
streets
in
the
direction
of
the
river
twisting
and
turning
in
a
way
which
confirmed
her
belief
in
the
dishonesty
of
his
purposes
it
was
now
long
after
midnight
and
the
streets
into
which
they
moved
were
quiet
and
almost
deserted
from
the
direction
of
the
miche
came
a
rumble
of
vehicles
the
glare
of
lights
the
distant
grunt
of
an
the
clatter
of
a
cab
horse
down
an
echoing
street
the
neighborhood
was
unfamiliar
to
her
a
part
of
old
paris
near
the
de
la
where
the
houses
relics
of
antiquity
were
huddled
into
ghostly
groups
clinging
to
one
another
illumined
fitfully
by
murky
which
only
served
to
make
their
grim
fa√ßades
more
somber
and
fantastic
dark
shapes
emerged
from
darker
shadows
and
leered
at
figures
bent
and
bedraggled
or
painted
and
bedizened
the
foul
of
the
city
the
scavengers
the
female
birds
of
prey
the
nighthawks
the
lepers
twice
she
was
accosted
once
by
a
vile
hag
that
clutched
at
her
arm
with
skinny
talons
and
again
by
a
man
who
tried
to
bar
her
way
but
with
a
strength
born
of
her
desperation
she
thrust
him
aside
and
ran
on
her
gaze
seeking
the
tall
figure
that
she
followed
more
than
once
she
lost
sight
of
him
as
he
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
maze
and
she
paused
trembling
in
the
shadows
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
but
gathering
courage
again
hurried
on
to
catch
the
glint
of
a
street
light
on
his
brown
overcoat
in
the
distance
above
the
roofs
almost
hanging
over
her
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
grim
towers
of
notre
dame
the
sentinels
of
a
thousand
years
of
time
and
the
sight
of
them
gave
her
courage
in
this
region
of
despair
with
an
effort
she
threw
off
her
terror
of
the
evil
that
seemed
to
hang
in
every
shadow
trying
to
remember
that
this
was
paris
her
paris
with
familiar
places
close
at
hand
and
that
this
man
whom
she
followed
was
no
creature
of
the
middle
ages
but
harry
her
husband
that
this
was
the
twentieth
century
and
that
here
was
the
very
heart
of
the
civilization
of
the
world
but
the
facts
that
had
come
to
her
were
amazing
and
harry
s
confessions
damnable
it
was
clear
that
his
position
was
desperate
and
his
intentions
none
less
so
here
somewhere
hidden
she
believed
jim
horton
lay
helpless
and
injured
if
not
by
his
brother
s
hand
by
that
of
some
one
in
his
employ
it
was
the
only
answer
to
the
riddle
of
his
failure
to
come
back
to
her
she
must
find
they
took
him
they
her
thoughts
terrified
her
again
harry
wouldn
t
dare
he
was
a
coward
at
heart
she
knew
it
now
besides
there
must
be
some
spark
of
decency
and
manhood
left
to
restrain
him
from
so
desperate
so
terrible
an
expedient
to
save
himself
she
crept
cautiously
to
the
corner
of
a
small
street
into
which
harry
horton
had
turned
it
was
scarcely
more
than
an
vestige
of
the
old
city
hedged
in
by
squat
stone
houses
with
peaked
roofs
deserted
it
seemed
and
unoccupied
beyond
she
could
see
the
the
loom
of
the
h√¥tel
dieu
and
notre
dame
the
house
at
which
he
had
stopped
was
but
a
few
yards
from
the
river
front
she
stole
into
the
blackness
of
an
angle
of
wall
and
watched
he
was
knocking
upon
the
quick
taps
followed
by
two
slower
ones
for
awhile
he
waited
impatiently
and
then
as
no
one
answered
the
summons
he
tried
the
window
and
then
started
up
a
small
passage
at
the
side
not
twenty
feet
from
where
she
crouched
her
pulses
were
throbbing
violently
but
the
terror
of
her
surroundings
had
passed
and
she
tried
to
convince
herself
that
she
did
not
fear
harry
and
yet
she
hesitated
to
confront
him
fascinated
by
her
discovery
the
was
as
sure
of
it
as
though
she
had
seen
him
she
knew
that
she
must
intercede
in
some
way
but
she
was
very
helpless
how
many
were
there
in
this
house
and
if
she
revealed
herself
would
not
the
warning
give
them
time
to
carry
out
whatever
plan
they
had
in
mind
and
so
she
crouched
watching
breathless
and
uncertain
she
saw
him
go
back
to
the
door
and
repeat
the
knock
more
loudly
cursing
under
his
breath
and
calling
a
name
at
the
tricot
he
called
tricot
tricot
and
in
a
moment
she
heard
a
sound
at
the
door
which
was
opened
a
few
inches
est
moi
she
heard
harry
say
and
then
the
door
was
opened
wide
giving
her
a
glimpse
of
a
short
man
with
tousled
hair
and
a
diabolic
face
holding
a
lantern
growled
the
man
with
the
lantern
stepping
aside
as
harry
horton
entered
and
just
as
moira
sprang
up
her
husband
s
name
on
her
lips
the
door
was
closed
and
bolted
she
ran
to
it
and
then
paused
in
uncertainty
trying
to
plan
what
it
was
best
to
do
she
felt
very
small
very
helpless
for
the
sight
of
the
villainous
looking
man
with
the
lantern
frightened
her
terribly
he
seemed
to
typify
all
the
evil
in
all
the
explain
in
a
glimpse
all
that
was
sinister
and
terrifying
in
the
disappearance
of
jim
horton
an
ugly
creature
of
the
world
of
underground
an
there
were
others
like
him
here
and
harry
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
her
thoughts
seemed
to
clear
her
courage
to
return
as
she
cautiously
returned
by
the
way
that
she
had
into
the
wider
street
up
which
she
hurried
turning
in
the
direction
of
the
miche
her
one
idea
now
was
to
find
a
policeman
one
with
a
vestige
of
authority
men
she
met
but
she
shrank
away
from
them
as
she
saw
what
they
were
and
what
they
thought
she
was
minutes
of
rapid
searching
without
result
and
she
turned
toward
the
quai
and
failing
there
over
the
to
the
island
and
the
prefecture
de
police
it
was
curious
that
she
had
not
thought
of
it
before
the
buildings
were
dark
but
she
found
at
last
a
man
in
uniform
to
whom
excitedly
she
told
her
story
he
listened
with
maddening
politeness
and
at
last
took
her
to
an
office
where
several
other
men
in
uniform
were
sitting
around
a
stove
more
alarmed
than
ever
at
the
passage
of
time
she
told
her
story
again
here
she
seemed
to
make
some
impression
at
last
for
an
older
man
who
sat
at
a
desk
finally
aroused
himself
and
gave
some
orders
and
in
a
few
moments
with
two
of
the
policemen
she
was
leading
the
way
back
to
the
she
was
almost
running
now
in
her
eagerness
so
that
the
men
had
to
take
their
longest
strides
to
keep
up
with
her
but
more
than
ten
minutes
had
already
passed
it
seemed
an
eternity
to
moira
and
there
was
still
some
distance
to
go
what
was
the
name
this
man
spoke
at
the
door
asked
one
of
the
policemen
she
told
him
ah
tricot
i
think
perhaps
mademoiselle
that
there
may
be
some
reason
in
your
anxiety
you
an
of
the
old
r√©gime
mademoiselle
we
would
do
well
to
find
him
and
so
explaining
her
fears
but
not
yet
revealing
all
the
reasons
for
them
she
led
the
way
down
the
streets
by
which
she
had
come
and
to
the
house
which
harry
horton
had
entered
the
older
man
knocked
loudly
upon
the
door
there
was
no
response
again
silence
the
other
man
went
up
the
alley
way
on
the
side
and
called
to
them
there
was
a
shutter
and
a
window
open
without
hesitation
he
drew
a
weapon
and
crawled
over
the
sill
the
other
man
following
leaving
moira
alone
she
listened
as
they
moved
about
inside
saw
the
glint
of
an
electric
torch
and
then
heard
the
bolts
of
the
door
shot
back
and
the
police
officer
calling
to
her
enter
mademoiselle
he
said
when
she
had
come
around
you
are
sure
that
this
is
the
house
yes
monsieur
there
is
no
one
here
the
house
is
deserted
it
is
a
street
of
deserted
houses
that
is
she
stammered
with
my
own
eyes
less
than
an
hour
ago
this
tricot
met
the
other
at
the
door
we
will
search
a
little
further
then
she
followed
them
up
the
rickety
stairway
and
then
they
found
evidences
of
recent
pallets
of
bottle
containing
absinthe
mademoiselle
you
are
right
this
bottle
is
not
yet
empty
there
s
something
suspicious
here
and
now
moving
with
more
rapidity
they
explored
the
house
thoroughly
descending
at
last
into
the
cellar
with
weapons
drawn
moira
following
just
behind
them
her
gaze
searching
the
shadows
the
place
smelled
of
the
earth
and
the
walls
were
damp
to
the
touch
but
a
quick
examination
with
the
torch
showed
the
marks
of
many
in
the
earthen
floor
the
astonishing
feature
of
the
cellar
was
its
size
for
it
seemed
to
extend
under
two
houses
and
its
vaulted
ceiling
of
rough
stone
of
great
antiquity
was
upheld
by
huge
piers
that
might
at
one
time
have
supported
the
walls
of
a
great
edifice
at
first
they
could
make
out
nothing
but
a
litter
of
papers
bottles
and
packing
cases
but
as
the
torch
of
the
police
officer
searched
the
shadows
in
a
distant
corner
they
heard
his
exclamation
of
astonishment
there
was
another
pallet
of
straw
here
covered
with
rags
and
quite
distinctly
there
came
to
their
nostrils
the
odor
of
chloroform
moira
peering
over
the
shoulders
of
the
man
with
the
light
saw
him
bend
over
and
pick
up
a
rag
and
examine
it
carefully
there
were
dark
stains
upon
it
and
then
with
another
exclamation
he
picked
up
some
pieces
of
rope
some
one
lay
here
but
a
short
while
ago
he
muttered
positively
tied
hand
and
foot
the
bed
is
still
warm
they
can
t
have
gone
far
but
the
door
was
bolted
on
the
the
there
would
hardly
have
been
time
is
it
not
so
mademoiselle
i
don
t
know
whispered
moira
in
dismay
is
there
no
outlet
to
this
place
there
must
be
the
light
in
the
corners
beyond
the
the
man
with
the
torch
his
professional
instincts
now
thoroughly
alive
obeyed
they
sounded
the
walls
first
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
coming
at
last
in
the
further
corner
toward
the
river
upon
a
stone
arch
over
some
steps
leading
into
a
dark
opening
the
man
who
held
the
light
suddenly
extinguished
it
and
a
warning
sound
came
from
his
lips
listen
he
whispered
scarcely
able
to
breathe
moira
obeyed
from
the
at
a
distance
there
came
the
sounds
of
voices
come
follow
me
dupuy
mademoiselle
had
better
remain
and
with
that
turning
his
light
into
the
dark
hole
he
descended
the
other
following
but
the
thought
of
remaining
alone
in
this
terrible
house
frightened
her
and
she
clutched
at
the
hand
of
the
second
policeman
i
dare
not
stay
here
monsieur
i
must
go
with
you
but
i
warn
you
it
may
be
dangerous
and
yet
what
could
be
more
dangerous
than
remaining
in
the
cellar
of
the
tricot
with
shaking
limbs
she
followed
down
the
passage
stumbling
and
clinging
to
the
shoulder
of
the
gallant
policeman
the
man
who
led
them
disappeared
beyond
a
turn
in
the
passage
but
they
reached
it
and
as
they
turned
the
corner
felt
the
chill
of
the
night
air
beating
in
their
faces
and
in
a
moment
they
came
out
on
the
shore
of
the
river
near
a
boat
landing
de
dieu
shouted
the
man
with
the
light
and
started
running
toward
the
steps
that
led
to
the
quai
above
the
other
had
reached
the
boat
landing
and
stared
for
a
moment
down
into
the
dark
mists
above
the
river
then
he
ran
up
the
steps
after
his
companion
frightened
and
mystified
moira
followed
up
the
steps
where
after
a
moment
the
two
men
joined
her
we
have
missed
them
we
were
too
but
the
prisoner
pleaded
moira
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
that
s
the
prisoner
said
the
younger
man
wait
a
moment
mademoiselle
and
he
ran
down
the
steps
to
the
boat
landing
again
peering
eagerly
down
the
stream
already
far
away
merely
a
blotch
in
the
shadows
beyond
the
pont
neuf
there
was
a
boat
at
the
quai
du
louvre
dupuy
there
may
be
yet
time
and
the
two
of
them
started
running
toward
the
distant
bridge
leaving
moira
to
follow
as
fast
as
she
could
when
moira
reached
them
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
breathless
and
almost
dead
of
apprehension
they
were
questioning
a
man
on
the
quai
du
louvre
he
reported
that
a
man
had
attempted
suicide
by
drowning
and
that
a
woman
had
saved
him
just
as
he
was
about
to
leap
into
the
water
she
herself
had
asked
his
assistance
and
together
they
had
hailed
a
passing
in
which
the
woman
had
driven
away
did
you
notice
anything
extraordinary
about
the
rescued
man
questioned
dupuy
nothing
except
that
he
was
very
pale
also
that
there
was
an
odor
of
chloroform
on
his
clothing
chloroform
are
you
sure
the
man
shrugged
you
may
smell
for
yourself
and
he
extended
a
hand
and
arm
upon
which
the
odor
was
unmistakable
she
heard
the
officer
take
the
address
of
the
witness
and
then
turn
to
her
mademoiselle
is
no
doubt
weary
there
is
nothing
more
that
can
be
done
if
you
will
permit
me
to
conduct
you
home
a
woman
who
moira
nodded
in
a
bewildered
way
a
monsieur
if
you
please
she
stammered
am
very
tired
takes
a
as
monsieur
valcourt
the
sculptor
had
said
piquette
morin
was
a
she
liked
the
warm
nest
in
the
boulevard
clichy
with
which
the
duc
de
vautrin
had
provided
her
because
it
satisfied
a
craving
for
the
creature
comforts
which
she
had
been
so
long
denied
and
because
it
filled
the
hearts
of
other
young
women
of
her
acquaintance
with
envy
but
she
was
not
happy
after
all
was
she
not
young
and
had
she
not
her
life
to
live
it
was
enough
indeed
to
have
grown
in
a
few
short
years
from
a
seller
of
flowers
and
a
model
for
the
figure
into
a
lady
of
fashion
but
her
heart
was
still
in
the
and
there
she
went
when
she
pleased
searching
out
her
old
haunts
and
the
companions
of
her
days
of
want
with
whom
she
could
throw
off
the
restraint
of
her
gilded
cage
and
laugh
with
an
open
throat
at
the
ancient
jests
and
dance
her
way
again
into
happiness
life
she
loved
all
shades
of
it
from
the
somber
in
which
she
had
been
born
to
the
brilliant
artificial
high
lights
of
caf√©
and
restaurant
all
sorts
of
people
she
bandits
dancers
satirists
artists
journalists
and
she
rejoiced
in
them
for
what
they
taught
her
of
the
quite
unhampered
by
morals
of
any
sort
trusting
entirely
to
her
impulses
which
were
often
good
the
creature
of
her
birth
and
surroundings
she
was
a
pupil
in
the
school
of
the
world
speaking
after
a
fashion
three
languages
she
discovered
that
she
had
a
brain
and
the
war
had
made
her
think
without
the
help
of
the
americans
france
must
fall
and
so
when
they
came
she
rejoiced
in
their
splendid
soldierly
appearance
and
the
promise
they
gave
of
rescue
and
help
for
france
she
met
harry
horton
in
the
taverne
du
pantheon
he
was
quite
drunk
and
didn
t
seem
to
have
any
h√¥tel
so
she
took
him
to
the
boulevard
clichy
in
a
and
put
him
to
bed
according
to
her
own
lights
it
was
the
only
natural
the
only
decent
thing
for
her
to
do
thus
it
happened
that
harry
horton
found
himself
to
his
surprise
on
excellent
terms
with
a
friend
of
the
duc
de
vautrin
about
whom
barry
quinlevin
had
been
writing
him
the
source
of
the
irishman
s
income
in
a
reckless
moment
he
confided
to
piquette
barry
quinlevin
s
secret
and
as
the
duc
de
vautrin
had
provoked
her
that
afternoon
by
refusing
her
the
money
for
a
hat
that
she
particularly
admired
she
turned
against
her
patron
entering
with
interest
into
a
plan
which
eventually
seemed
to
promise
much
that
she
repented
of
her
disloyalty
the
next
day
when
monsieur
de
vautrin
relented
was
a
disappointment
to
harry
horton
who
saw
a
way
in
which
she
could
be
useful
to
him
also
harry
horton
was
sure
that
he
had
talked
too
much
for
it
was
hardly
safe
to
make
a
confidante
of
a
weathervane
when
harry
horton
left
paris
to
join
his
regiment
piquette
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
and
in
a
few
days
he
was
only
a
memory
he
had
been
her
but
even
in
the
one
got
drunk
like
a
gentleman
the
meeting
in
the
restaurant
of
leon
javet
came
at
an
opportune
moment
the
duc
had
again
developed
a
habit
of
meticulous
inquiry
also
for
reasons
of
his
own
had
reduced
her
allowance
the
familiar
figure
in
brown
was
pleasing
after
the
day
of
labor
in
the
studio
of
monsieur
valcourt
he
represented
a
part
of
life
that
she
could
not
this
very
morning
she
had
read
of
him
in
the
bulletins
as
the
hero
of
boissi√®re
wood
and
so
she
had
welcomed
him
in
her
joyous
way
sure
in
spite
of
his
deficiencies
that
their
friendship
had
been
no
mistake
a
hero
of
course
she
was
glad
to
see
him
but
the
reserve
in
his
manner
had
mystified
her
he
was
like
another
man
he
was
quieter
finer
gentler
and
yet
very
brave
and
strong
a
little
perhaps
but
more
deep
more
interesting
and
touched
with
the
dignity
of
one
who
faces
death
for
a
noble
purpose
but
piquette
had
not
lived
in
the
streets
of
paris
all
these
years
for
nothing
a
few
months
of
warfare
would
not
change
a
man
s
soul
what
was
this
strangeness
what
had
come
over
him
he
had
packed
her
home
in
a
just
when
she
was
becoming
most
interested
in
this
extraordinary
transformation
she
had
never
before
suffered
from
pique
and
it
annoyed
her
that
he
shouldn
t
have
been
more
eager
to
resume
their
ancient
fellowship
who
was
this
unshaven
fellow
with
the
slouch
hat
and
worn
clothing
who
had
so
great
a
claim
upon
his
attention
his
figure
too
had
a
familiar
look
his
manner
had
been
even
and
harry
had
obeyed
the
summons
banishing
her
piquette
to
the
outer
darkness
of
the
boulevard
clichy
and
he
had
not
written
her
or
telephoned
all
day
she
waited
in
expecting
to
hear
from
him
and
expectation
increased
her
interest
and
her
disappointment
also
meditation
gave
her
a
perspective
they
were
curious
these
second
thoughts
deepening
the
impression
of
a
striking
difference
between
this
harry
horton
and
the
one
who
had
gotten
drunk
in
the
taverne
du
pantheon
idiosyncrasies
that
had
escaped
her
during
the
few
moments
they
had
been
together
at
javet
s
came
to
her
now
with
startling
clearness
the
slow
direct
gaze
the
deliberate
motions
of
the
hands
their
touch
on
she
started
upright
as
a
thought
came
to
her
like
a
de
the
twisted
little
finger
he
had
broken
that
night
at
the
pantheon
it
had
bothered
him
only
a
few
days
and
it
had
never
been
set
she
remembered
now
the
fingers
of
the
right
hand
of
the
visitor
on
his
wine
glass
at
javet
s
remarking
how
strong
they
were
little
finger
was
it
was
curious
that
such
a
trifle
should
come
to
her
with
such
significance
it
was
also
curious
that
she
hadn
t
noticed
it
at
the
time
could
she
be
mistaken
when
night
came
and
she
had
not
heard
from
harry
she
went
out
and
made
her
way
across
the
river
leaving
word
where
she
was
to
be
found
if
the
visitor
called
and
went
straight
to
the
caf√©
of
gabriel
pochard
she
and
gabriel
were
friends
of
long
standing
many
years
ago
when
she
was
but
a
for
fabien
gabriel
pochard
had
posed
around
the
studios
with
long
hair
for
prophets
and
saints
but
he
had
married
some
money
and
opened
the
which
bore
his
name
it
was
not
a
beautiful
place
and
as
she
knew
was
frequented
by
persons
not
of
the
the
gamblers
the
sharpers
the
wealthy
outcasts
of
all
kinds
who
knew
a
good
omelette
when
they
tasted
one
and
relished
a
particular
kind
of
seclusion
for
here
no
questions
were
asked
it
was
at
gabriel
pochard
s
that
harry
horton
spent
much
time
for
he
had
come
with
a
letter
to
gabriel
from
monsieur
quinlevin
who
had
known
pochard
since
the
days
of
posing
for
the
great
monsieur
ger√¥me
it
was
here
that
she
would
find
harry
horton
or
news
of
him
and
information
which
would
perhaps
answer
the
strange
sequence
of
questions
that
had
come
rising
to
her
mind
she
had
the
french
passion
for
the
mysterious
the
unexplainable
and
with
her
own
pride
as
the
stake
she
meant
to
leave
no
stone
unturned
which
would
help
her
to
a
solution
of
the
problem
she
found
gabriel
wearing
a
sober
air
busy
with
his
bottles
and
the
caf√©
was
blue
with
tobacco
smoke
all
she
said
in
the
argot
you
wear
a
worried
look
has
leon
javet
been
stealing
away
your
customers
ah
est
toi
what
brings
you
here
alone
my
legs
if
you
would
know
the
a
woman
s
curiosity
that
is
nothing
new
how
can
i
help
you
i
want
you
tell
me
what
you
know
of
arry
orton
gabriel
frowned
and
glanced
about
him
cautiously
he
said
warningly
and
then
in
a
whisper
who
told
you
that
monsieur
orton
was
here
she
laughed
did
i
not
see
him
myself
with
my
own
eyes
last
night
where
at
javet
s
and
then
in
a
meaning
tone
as
she
looked
him
in
the
eyes
another
he
glanced
at
her
his
face
which
still
showed
traces
of
great
beauty
twisted
unpleasantly
and
then
beckoned
her
to
follow
him
through
a
door
nearby
into
his
office
and
when
they
were
seated
what
did
you
mean
piquette
what
i
said
put
in
piquette
lighting
a
cigarette
another
and
then
as
gabriel
s
frown
deepened
she
shot
straight
at
her
mark
there
are
two
arry
ortons
gabriel
pochard
she
said
coolly
the
effect
of
her
words
on
gabriel
was
not
lost
on
her
he
looked
around
him
furtively
and
caught
her
by
the
wrist
who
told
you
this
it
s
true
then
asked
piquette
who
told
you
my
own
eyes
the
visitor
at
javet
s
had
no
twisted
little
finger
and
no
one
else
has
noticed
not
so
far
as
i
am
aware
gabriel
pochard
gave
a
great
gasp
of
relief
child
but
you
have
sharp
eyes
if
they
weren
t
sharp
i
would
still
be
selling
flowers
outside
the
caf√©
soufflet
tell
me
the
truth
of
this
thing
gabriel
she
said
settling
herself
in
her
chair
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
come
to
stay
it
is
what
i
came
here
to
find
out
he
glanced
at
her
then
frowned
at
the
floor
and
shook
his
head
oh
yes
you
will
tell
me
that
it
is
none
of
my
business
she
said
firmly
it
is
my
right
to
know
and
then
as
he
remained
silent
you
are
aware
that
i
am
not
one
to
be
refused
gabriel
rose
from
the
chair
at
the
desk
and
paced
up
and
down
the
narrow
apartment
but
still
he
did
not
speak
and
then
at
last
what
devil
put
it
into
your
head
to
come
here
inquiring
of
this
matter
the
devil
she
said
with
a
gesture
and
then
with
a
little
shrug
and
a
sober
mien
you
may
trust
me
gabriel
he
stopped
and
sat
in
his
chair
again
as
you
have
said
it
is
your
right
but
it
is
no
matter
to
be
breathed
outside
this
room
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
i
have
kept
your
secrets
i
should
not
tell
you
gabriel
pochard
shrugged
last
night
late
a
man
came
in
here
to
see
me
a
man
wearing
old
clothing
and
a
three
weeks
growth
of
beard
it
was
monsieur
orton
he
was
very
much
excited
and
told
me
a
remarkable
story
that
rivals
the
tales
of
monsieur
hugo
yes
i
understand
go
on
he
said
he
was
wounded
upon
the
battlefield
at
night
when
out
of
the
darkness
appeared
just
beside
him
the
very
image
of
himself
it
was
his
twin
brother
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
five
years
a
brother
with
whom
he
did
not
speak
was
what
i
the
brother
took
from
monsieur
orton
his
uniform
and
went
on
leading
his
men
to
victory
it
was
the
fight
of
boissi√®re
wood
you
have
heard
piquette
nodded
this
interloper
took
monsieur
orton
s
uniform
his
rank
and
identity
and
now
comes
back
to
monsieur
orton
s
own
apartment
and
monsieur
orton
s
piquette
had
started
to
her
feet
her
fingers
grasping
the
shoulder
of
gabriel
his
she
broke
in
his
wife
repeated
pochard
you
did
not
know
he
never
told
me
she
stammered
the
daughter
of
my
ancient
friend
monsieur
barry
quinlevin
said
pochard
with
a
shrug
you
re
sure
as
certain
as
i
sit
here
piquette
sank
into
her
chair
frowning
deeply
go
on
she
muttered
they
had
met
last
night
on
the
street
in
the
dark
monsieur
orton
demanded
of
his
brother
to
relinquish
his
identity
he
refused
monsieur
orton
came
to
me
it
was
an
act
of
injustice
monsieur
orton
was
outcast
something
had
to
be
done
i
helped
him
piquette
had
been
listening
intently
thinking
deeply
the
while
as
pochard
finished
she
searched
his
face
frown
deepening
there
s
something
at
the
back
of
this
pochard
tell
me
the
rest
pochard
hesitated
scratched
his
head
and
shrugged
shoulder
i
do
not
like
it
you
understand
it
has
worried
me
all
soldier
one
can
not
tell
what
would
happen
if
the
piquette
understood
at
once
her
fingers
closed
again
over
the
arm
of
pochard
what
have
you
done
with
him
pochard
bent
forward
whispering
he
lies
in
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
by
the
river
a
knock
on
the
est
chloroform
piquette
was
silent
staring
at
the
wall
then
she
fixed
her
wide
gaze
on
the
conspirator
bah
you
are
a
fool
pochard
she
shot
at
him
they
will
catch
you
sure
how
much
two
thousand
francs
and
you
get
half
contemptuously
who
did
it
tricot
and
singe
tricot
piquette
got
up
and
paced
the
length
of
the
room
turning
quickly
you
are
an
idiot
pochard
she
stormed
at
him
furiously
an
american
don
t
you
know
what
you
have
done
it
is
the
hero
of
boissi√®re
wood
that
you
have
struck
down
an
has
risked
his
life
for
you
and
but
monsieur
he
has
lied
to
you
i
do
not
she
broke
off
caught
pochard
by
the
arm
again
and
shook
him
when
did
this
happen
last
and
arry
orton
was
pochard
shrugged
bad
he
was
in
uniform
where
is
he
now
i
think
he
has
gone
to
find
his
wife
his
wife
piquette
sank
into
her
chair
took
out
a
cigarette
and
smoked
rapidly
for
a
moment
and
then
what
were
you
going
to
do
with
twin
brother
i
pochard
gave
a
gesture
of
abnegation
nothing
i
am
through
that
is
the
affair
of
monsieur
orton
all
but
you
can
t
wriggle
out
so
easily
you
ve
received
pochard
put
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
and
extended
his
long
legs
frowning
at
the
floor
i
am
sorry
now
it
is
a
bad
the
man
is
safe
so
far
but
tricot
he
waits
for
orders
piquette
ground
her
cigarette
under
her
heel
and
rose
abruptly
with
an
air
of
decision
this
american
must
be
liberated
at
once
pochard
rose
and
faced
her
it
s
too
late
he
growled
no
it
s
not
too
late

the
sort

own
skins
now
you
mean
she
paused
significantly
the
he
nodded
somberly
it
is
the
solution
of
many
problems
she
caught
him
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him
but
not
of
problem
you
understand
it
will
not
do
i
will
not
have
it
you
he
laughed
what
can
you
do

shall
go
with
me

he
took
her
hands
from
his
arms
roughly
and
turned
away
no
he
growled

i
not
told
you
that
i

will
be

police

matter

fool

he
drinks

pochard

and

t

too
sure
i
can
t
but
i
must
trust
to
luck
piquette
stamped
her
foot
i
ve
no
patience
with
you
and
then
you
will
not
liberate
him
no
i
refuse
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
the
matter
you
will
regret
it
perhaps
that
will
be
my
own
lookout
she
stared
at
him
in
a
moment
of
indecision
and
then
with
a
shrug
turned
toward
the
door
into
the
caf√©
you
are
an
idiot
gabriel
pochard
grunted
as
he
followed
her
you
will
say
nothing
scornfully
i
am
not
an
informer
but
i
should
like
to
knock
you
on
the
head
too
she
put
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
where
are
you
going
he
asked
to
the
rue
charron
he
caught
her
hand
away
from
the
knob
and
held
her
why
should
you
intrude
in
this
affair
it
amuses
me
i
warn
you
that
you
will
run
into
danger
they
will
not
harm
me
you
must
not
go
yes
i
shall
save
you
from
the
results
of
your
you
will
not
save
yourself
i
will
not
permit
you
have
nothing
to
say
in
the
you
ve
washed
your
hands
of
it
she
threw
his
hand
off
and
opened
the
door
piquette
he
called
but
she
went
rapidly
into
the
other
room
before
he
could
intercept
her
ran
quickly
out
into
the
street
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
she
was
throbbing
now
deep
with
purpose
it
was
only
in
moments
like
these
that
life
ran
swiftly
in
her
veins
the
excitement
of
the
venture
was
like
a
tonic
and
she
went
on
rapidly
toward
the
miche
as
she
walked
she
went
over
in
detail
the
conversation
she
had
had
last
night
in
the
caf√©
javet
it
was
not
surprising
that
she
had
not
guessed
the
truth
last
night
for
the
new
harry
horton
s
information
as
to
his
brother
s
affairs
had
blinded
her
to
the
physical
differences
such
as
there
were
between
them
perhaps
it
was
the
glamor
that
his
heroism
had
thrown
about
him
perhaps
it
was
his
gravity
or
perhaps
the
depth
of
his
voice
or
the
penetrating
quality
of
his
steady
gaze
but
she
had
not
been
able
to
deny
all
day
a
new
and
extraordinary
appreciation
of
the
newcomer
whose
virtues
half
guessed
at
seemed
to
bring
harry
horton
s
deficiencies
into
higher
relief
and
the
mystery
of
his
sudden
appearance
and
the
strange
tale
of
gabriel
pochard
provided
the
added
touches
to
stimulate
her
interest
in
him
as
she
had
told
gabriel
there
was
something
back
of
this
mystery
of
dual
identity
and
she
meant
to
discover
the
truth
as
to
one
thing
she
was
resolved
the
beautiful
young
soldier
of
the
caf√©
javet
should
not
die
if
there
was
anything
that
she
could
do
to
prevent
it
tricot
was
a
bad
one
so
was
singe
either
of
them
was
capable
of
anything
she
was
acquainted
with
them
both
but
she
did
not
fear
them
for
she
knew
the
freemasonry
of
their
evil
calling
and
had
even
been
in
the
little
room
of
gabriel
pochard
when
they
had
discussed
their
business
affairs
but
this
matter
concerned
a
human
being
in
whom
she
was
interested
no
harm
should
come
to
him
it
could
not
be
she
wanted
him
for
herself
and
so
at
last
having
decided
that
she
must
move
with
caution
and
leave
the
rest
to
chance
and
opportunity
she
went
toward
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
she
had
been
there
before
some
years
ago
with
gabriel
pochard
when
the
of
champagne
from
up
the
river
had
been
smuggled
in
thus
it
was
that
she
knew
the
secret
of
the
old
passage
to
the
river
bank
hidden
from
the
opposite
shore
by
a
barricade
of
old
timber
so
instead
of
approaching
the
house
by
way
of
the
rue
charron
she
went
down
toward
the
river
and
turned
in
to
the
quai
des
augustins
there
were
a
few
people
about
but
she
watched
her
opportunity
and
when
she
reached
the
steps
descended
to
the
boat
landing
where
she
found
herself
alone
and
unobserved
hidden
from
the
lights
above
by
the
shadow
of
the
retaining
wall
here
she
paused
a
moment
to
think
and
plan
according
to
all
the
rules
of
the
underworld
the
prisoner
would
be
in
the
cellar
of
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
but
if
tricot
or
were
taking
turns
guarding
him
there
her
problem
would
be
difficult
because
it
meant
a
scene
in
which
her
persuasions
and
promises
of
immunity
might
fail
and
tricot
could
be
ugly
money
yes
perhaps
if
everything
else
failed
but
she
had
a
sense
of
pride
in
the
belief
that
with
luck
favoring
her
she
could
accomplish
this
rescue
alone
at
any
rate
she
meant
to
make
the
so
she
found
the
end
of
the
tunnel
and
with
some
difficulty
and
damage
to
her
gloves
and
clothing
wrenched
at
the
boarding
the
timbers
were
old
and
rotten
as
she
knew
and
it
was
not
difficult
to
make
a
passage
it
was
so
easy
in
fact
that
she
began
to
believe
that
tricot
had
more
wisely
kept
his
prisoner
upstairs
but
as
she
moved
forward
cautiously
one
hand
steadying
her
progress
over
the
rough
masonry
she
caught
the
first
dull
glimmer
of
yellow
light
as
she
came
to
a
turn
in
the
passage
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
stole
forward
quietly
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
peering
up
into
the
cellar
at
first
she
could
see
nothing
but
a
litter
of
boxes
bottles
and
waste
paper
and
then
coming
up
one
step
at
a
time
she
searched
the
recesses
of
the
cavern
one
by
one
a
lantern
burned
dimly
near
the
foot
of
the
flight
of
steps
leading
to
the
floor
above
but
there
was
no
sign
of
any
one
watching
and
so
she
emerged
cautiously
from
the
dark
hole
and
stood
up
in
a
moment
she
found
what
she
was
looking
for
huddled
in
the
corner
to
her
right
she
made
out
the
contours
of
a
human
figure
with
another
quick
glance
toward
the
steps
and
a
moment
to
listen
for
any
sound
above
she
approached
noiselessly
he
was
trussed
with
a
rope
from
head
to
foot
his
hands
tied
behind
him
but
he
was
the
man
she
sought
she
bent
over
him
noticing
his
heavy
breathing
and
the
odor
of
the
drug
at
the
touch
of
her
hand
he
stirred
slightly
and
she
saw
the
blood
upon
his
face
monsieur
she
whispered
quickly
it
is
i
have
come
to
help
you
he
stirred
again
and
tried
to
move
but
the
drug
was
heavy
in
his
blood
so
she
shook
him
furiously
trying
to
arouse
him
it
is
piquette
she
whispered
again
his
lips
moved
and
his
eyelids
fluttered
open
he
muttered
and
then
breathed
stertorously
this
was
encouraging
she
shook
him
again
and
again
fighting
the
lethargy
he
moved
and
groaned
it
seemed
almost
certain
that
his
guardians
must
hear
him
she
whispered
silence
meanwhile
she
was
struggling
with
the
knots
of
the
cord
that
bound
his
wrists
at
last
she
managed
to
get
his
arms
free
and
moved
them
backward
and
forward
with
all
her
strength
trying
to
restore
his
circulation
then
she
unfastened
the
cords
at
his
feet
and
pulled
his
knees
up
thumping
him
from
time
to
time
and
whispering
at
his
ear
wake
up
monsieur
you
mus
get
out
of
dis
wit
his
lips
moved
again
it
s
piquette
monsieur
she
repeated
prodding
at
him
and
shaking
his
shoulders
this
time
his
eyelids
opened
wider
and
he
looked
at
her
vaguely
but
his
lips
muttered
her
name
you
mus
rouse
mus
we
are
going
out
of
once
with
an
effort
he
struggled
up
to
a
sitting
posture
while
she
supported
him
pinching
his
shoulders
and
arms
then
she
saw
for
the
first
time
an
earthen
pitcher
on
a
stool
nearby
there
was
still
some
water
in
it
and
she
threw
it
in
his
face
he
sputtered
and
choked
but
she
silenced
him
your
life
dey
re
upstairs
aren
t
dey
m
weak
as
a
cat
naturally
but
you
ve
got
to
elp
yourself
i
can
t
carry
you
carry
he
toppled
sideways
and
would
have
fallen
but
she
caught
him
and
held
him
shaking
and
pinching
him
again
no
you
ve
to
wake
up
do
you
hear
she
whispered
desperately
they
may
come
down
ere
at
any
moment
a
dim
notion
of
what
she
was
talking
about
seemed
to
come
to
him
for
with
an
effort
he
threw
off
the
heaviness
that
was
coming
over
him
again
did
by
an
old
passage
from
dis
cellar
to
de
river
you
mus
go
out
dat
way
do
you
on
erstand
me
he
nodded
feebly
he
muttered
there
was
another
struggle
against
the
drug
and
another
but
at
last
she
got
him
to
understand
he
was
very
weak
but
managed
to
support
himself
with
an
effort
sitting
upright
while
piquette
ran
over
toward
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
listened
intently
for
if
tricot
and
the
englishman
were
listening
they
must
surely
have
heard
something
of
the
commotion
she
had
made
but
there
was
no
sound
she
went
back
to
the
injured
man
would
he
be
able
to
walk
she
shook
him
again
and
pointed
to
the
way
by
which
she
had
come
it
is
de
way
of
escape
you
mus
make
de
effort
she
helped
him
struggle
to
his
knees
one
of
his
arms
around
her
shoulders
but
when
she
attempted
to
get
him
to
his
feet
his
knees
gave
out
and
he
fell
dragging
her
down
with
him
it
was
at
this
moment
of
failure
that
a
sudden
clamor
of
knocking
at
the
street
door
upstairs
came
with
terrifying
clearness
to
her
ears
and
the
sound
of
a
masculine
voice
calling
the
name
of
tricot
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
yet
what
was
she
to
do
she
was
strong
but
she
could
not
lift
the
american
bodily
and
he
had
collapsed
again
upon
the
floor
for
an
agonized
moment
she
listened
a
long
silence
and
then
the
knocking
was
renewed
followed
by
the
sound
of
another
voice
upstairs
and
the
tread
of
heavy
feet
going
toward
the
door
desperate
now
and
aware
that
only
the
american
s
own
efforts
could
save
him
she
lifted
him
again
by
sheer
strength
to
his
knees
dey
ll
be
down
ere
in
a
moment
she
stammered
in
his
ear
you
ve
got
to
help
yourself
you
ve
got
to
your
de
corner
beyond
de
pillar
i
will
elp
you
he
seemed
to
understand
and
struggled
a
few
feet
paused
in
weakness
then
struggled
on
again
and
all
the
while
piquette
was
listening
to
the
sounds
upstairs
the
voices
which
now
seemed
to
be
near
the
head
of
the
stairway
coming
to
her
ears
distinctly
we
ve
got
to
get
him
away
from
into
the
country
lose
him
harry
horton
s
voice
why
growled
a
voice
in
english
moira
quinlevin
knows
the
truth
an
oath
from
tricot
as
the
other
translated
who
told
her
no
one
she
guessed
it
parbleu
we
shall
take
no
chances
then
you
must
take
him
into
the
country
said
harry
s
voice
again
and
leave
him
to
recover
and
set
the
police
on
us
not
much
he
ll
have
to
go
the
long
road
my
god
no
not
that
cried
harry
the
river
growled
tricot
and
then
the
other
voice
you
started
this
thing
and
it
s
got
to
be
finished
did
you
bring
the
money
can
there
was
the
beginning
of
a
violent
discussion
in
which
tricot
s
advice
seemed
to
prevail
harry
s
opinions
wouldn
t
matter
much
to
these
precious
villains
but
piquette
had
heard
enough
it
seemed
that
they
were
about
to
descend
the
stairs
to
the
prisoner
and
glancing
backward
she
labored
with
the
injured
man
until
they
reached
the
shadows
of
the
pillar
into
which
she
pushed
and
dragged
him
until
they
were
both
hidden
from
the
light
of
the
lantern
but
the
steps
into
the
passage
were
still
ten
feet
away
already
there
were
footsteps
on
the
stair
where
one
of
the
men
stood
still
arguing
with
harry
horton
with
a
final
effort
she
urged
the
drugged
man
toward
the
opening
and
then
tumbled
him
down
into
the
darkness
she
heard
the
steps
coming
down
the
stairs
heard
them
pause
and
a
voice
again
raised
in
argument
but
she
listened
no
more
the
situation
was
desperate
for
in
a
few
seconds
at
the
least
the
escape
of
the
prisoner
would
be
discovered
so
forgetting
caution
she
pinched
and
shook
him
by
main
strength
of
her
strong
young
arms
urging
him
forward
something
of
the
imminence
of
his
danger
seemed
to
come
to
him
for
he
crawled
to
the
corner
and
then
stumbled
in
some
fashion
to
his
feet
clinging
to
her
the
air
beyond
the
turn
in
the
passage
seemed
to
revive
him
and
in
a
moment
swaying
and
struggling
against
his
weakness
he
stood
outside
the
opening
upon
the
leaning
against
the
wall
while
piquette
thrust
the
boards
across
the
opening
she
heard
a
cry
now
from
beyond
the
passage
and
with
the
injured
man
s
arm
around
her
shoulders
led
the
way
down
the
bank
to
the
landing
he
caught
her
intention
there
was
a
boat
there
and
she
got
him
into
it
and
pushed
off
from
the
shore
into
the
stream
she
was
almost
exhausted
by
this
time
but
managed
to
get
out
the
oars
and
make
some
progress
down
the
river
before
the
timbers
fell
from
before
the
opening
in
the
wall
and
three
men
harry
and
the
englishman
she
saw
their
shapes
dimly
in
the
shadow
of
the
wall
but
a
strange
thing
happened
then
for
the
three
figures
went
flying
up
the
steps
to
the
quai
and
then
ran
as
though
for
their
lives
in
the
direction
of
the
pont
michel
but
she
managed
at
last
to
reach
the
quai
du
louvre
where
with
the
help
of
a
belated
she
managed
to
get
the
man
she
had
rescued
into
a
and
so
to
the
boulevard
clichy
when
jim
horton
came
to
his
senses
after
his
rescue
he
found
himself
in
a
small
room
overlooking
a
pleasant
fa√ßade
of
gray
stone
tinted
softly
by
the
pale
morning
sunlight
it
was
some
moments
before
he
managed
to
gather
his
scattered
wits
together
and
out
of
the
haze
and
darkness
in
which
he
had
been
groping
for
two
nights
and
a
day
recall
the
incidents
of
his
escape
piquette
he
remembered
but
what
was
this
room
there
had
been
a
late
in
the
had
been
carried
up
a
flight
of
stairs
as
he
turned
in
the
bed
he
was
aware
of
a
figure
which
rose
from
the
corner
of
the
room
and
approached
him
it
was
an
oldish
woman
in
the
neat
uniform
of
a
maid
she
smiled
monsieur
is
awake
and
then
moving
toward
the
door
madame
shall
come
at
once
but
when
piquette
entered
the
small
room
attired
in
a
gorgeous
pink
lounging
robe
of
silk
and
lace
and
wearing
a
embroidered
with
silken
flowers
and
golden
thread
she
dazzled
him
for
a
moment
with
her
splendor
and
he
did
not
recognize
her
she
came
forward
to
him
quickly
and
laid
her
cool
hand
on
his
brow
ah
petit
c
est
and
then
in
english
ow
do
you
feel

jim

he
asked
dis
room

in
de
hallway
adjoining

added
as
he
paused
he
put
out
his
hand
and
fingered
the
lace
of
her
sleeve
did
you
do
this
for
me
piquette
she
caught
his
hand
pressed
it
in
hers
and
then
rose
abruptly
what
does
it
matter
you
s
all
talk
no
more
until
after
de
doctor
as
seen
you
later
in
the
day
after
jim
horton
had
slept
again
piquette
visited
him
dressed
for
the
street
in
a
few
words
she
told
him
how
she
had
guessed
at
the
double
confirmed
it
and
then
how
she
had
discovered
the
means
harry
horton
had
employed
to
get
his
brother
out
of
the
way
she
dwelt
lightly
on
his
rescue
from
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
and
explained
quite
frankly
her
own
relations
with
the
criminals
est
la
grande
vie
monsieur
l
she
said
with
an
expressive
gesture
you
remember
perhaps
what
monsieur
valcourt
as
said
i
am
still
de
i
know
dat
pochard
since
i
am
so
high
but
why
have
you
done
this
for
me
piquette
when
you
found
out
that
i
was
not
my
oh

la

perhaps

little
de
night
in

but
more
dat

and
singe

ave
t
rown
you
in
de
river
monsieur
you
saved
my
yes
you
see
she
paused
in
search
of
a
name
my
name
is
jim
horton
jeem
est
bon
jeem
orton
dere
wasn
anyt
ing
else
for
me
to
do
you
were
a
good
ad
fought
at
la
boissi√®re
for
france
and
for
me
an
had
not
it
could
not
be
dat
you
should
die
but
dere
are
many
t
ings
i
do
not
yet
on
erstand
if
you
would
tell
jim
horton
was
silent
a
moment
thinking
deeply
you
were
a
friend
of
my
brother
s
he
put
it
more
in
the
form
of
a
statement
than
a
question
yes
jeem
orton
she
said
before
e
went
to
de
front
dat
does
not
matter
now
i
can
assure
you
what
appen
at
boissi√®re
wood
pochard
tol
me
what
arry
orton
and
she
related
it
as
nearly
as
possible
in
pochard
s
own
words
jim
horton
listened
smiling
slightly
until
she
had
finished
and
then
i
had
intended
to
keep
silent
about
this
thing
piquette
but
i
m
not
going
to
keep
silent
now
i
m
going
to
tell
the
truth
whatever
happens
to
harry
or
to
me
he
would
have
killed
no
she
broke
in
i
t
ink
arry
was
frighten
at
what
he
ad
he
wasn
t
too
frightened
to
get
those
chaps
to
knock
me
in
the
head
he
put
in
dryly
then
broke
off
with
a
sudden
sense
of
the
situation
i
hope
madame
that
you
do
not
care
for
him
she
had
been
watching
him
intently
and
now
put
her
hand
over
his
jeem
orton
she
said
carelessly
but
tell
me
de
he
looked
at
her
for
a
long
moment
no
one
has
a
better
right
to
know
it
than
you
and
then
without
ornamentation
he
related
the
facts
from
the
unfortunate
moment
that
night
when
he
had
put
on
harry
s
uniform
and
gone
into
the
fight
until
he
had
met
his
brother
in
the
rue
de
tavennes
she
heard
him
through
to
the
end
you
ave
not
told
me
everyt
ing
jeem
orton
and
then
significantly
about
orton
he
frowned
and
then
went
on
with
an
assumption
of
carelessness
the
situation
was
impossible
as
you
will
see
i
would
have
gone
he
shrugged
if
harry
hadn
t
saved
me
the
need
of
it
but
he
paused
and
clenched
a
fist
he
has
much
to
answer
to
me
for
she
was
silent
for
a
while
watching
him
a
coward
i
might
ave
known
she
murmured
after
a
moment
in
the
conversation
that
followed
many
things
were
revealed
to
jim
horton
many
things
to
piquette
he
learned
from
her
own
lips
every
detail
of
the
story
of
quinlevin
s
plot
against
the
duc
and
what
was
to
be
moira
s
share
in
it
and
he
listened
in
anger
and
amazement
as
to
her
relations
with
de
vautrin
she
spoke
with
the
utmost
frankness
he
was
not
a
pleasant
person
and
to
her
mind
for
all
his
money
and
position
possessed
fewer
virtues
even
than
the
outrageous
pochard
and
his
crew
who
at
least
were
villains
and
made
no
pretenses
the
duc
was
and
degenerate
√ßa
m
emb√™te
why
she
had
not
cut
loose
from
him
and
gone
back
to
live
in
the
she
did
not
know
except
that
it
was
comfortable
in
the
boulevard
clichy
and
she
was
tired
of
working
hard
he
found
himself
regarding
piquette
with
interest
the
type
was
new
to
him
but
he
liked
her
immensely
she
might
betray
her
duc
but
in
her
own
mind
she
would
have
perfectly
adequate
reasons
for
doing
so
as
to
moira
little
enough
was
said
if
she
suspected
anything
of
his
tenderness
in
that
quarter
she
gave
not
a
sign
of
it
but
he
could
see
that
the
facts
as
to
his
brother
s
marriage
had
come
as
a
surprise
to
her
an
now
jeem
orton
said
piquette
the
next
morning
when
he
had
strength
enough
to
sit
in
a
chair
by
the
window
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
he
thought
for
a
moment
you
have
given
me
my
life
i
should
dislike
to
do
anything
that
would
give
you
unhappiness
as
to
that
she
said
carelessly
you
s
all
do
what
you
t
ink
bes
you
know
perhaps
dat
in
de
place
de
la
concorde
your
brother
arry
is
to
receive
de
croix
de
guerre
he
had
forgotten
but
the
announcement
had
no
effect
upon
him
it
does
not
matter
he
muttered
what
he
had
been
thinking
in
his
moments
of
wakefulness
was
of
harry
going
to
the
studio
in
the
rue
de
tavennes
moira
was
his
wife
would
she
like
piquette
learn
at
once
of
the
deception
or
would
she
accept
him
you
do
not
care
for
de
honors
you
have
won
asked
piquette
breaking
on
his
thought
they
weren
t
my
but
you
bear
de
yes
and
they
re
proofs
my
brother
will
find
it
hard
to
answer
but
tell
me
piquette
what
you
have
heard
do
they
suspect
you
of
having
carried
me
off
piquette
laughed
no

jus
as

your

lucky
to
get
away
who
could

what
does
it

pause
no

we

because

his
eager
look
inquired
her
meaning
√©mile
pochard
would
never

he
laughed
and
you
value
the
friendship
of
monsieur

no
but
i
know

law
of
de
it
would
not
be
pleasant
to
ave

s
t
roat
cut
an
be
t
rown
in
de
seine
the
true
meaning
of
the
danger
that
she
had
run
for
him
gave
jim
horton
a
new
and
lively
sense
of
his
obligations
and
responsibilities
to
this
strange
creature
he
caught
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
warmly
how
can
i
ever
repay
you
he
blurted
out
her
face
flushed
gently
and
she
regarded
him
with
eyes
almost
maternal
what
a
boy
you
are
she
laughed
but
a
stranger
to
you
to
have
run
such
have
made
such
a
struggle
just
because
you
knew
i
was
helpless
it

it

tasted
everyt
ing
else
in

fear
to

safe
and
each
of

as

all

piquette
he
said
you
re
a
wonder
i
ll
never
ah
yes
you
will
she
broke
in
with
a
shrug
you
are
different
from
arry
you
are
always
grand
it
was
what
i
noticed
at
javet
s
you
will
love
much
but
you
will
never
lie
jus
to
make
a
woman
appy
and
will
forget
jeem
orton
never
he
said
stoutly
never
piquette
you
re
the
bravest
squarest
woman
in
the
world
she
laughed
again
for
shall
kees
you
and
she
did
with
a
friendly
frankness
upon
the
mouth
it
was
a
very
pleasant
sanctuary
this
into
which
fortune
had
thrown
him
but
deep
in
his
heart
jim
horton
knew
that
piquette
had
read
him
truly
he
was
no
panderer
to
women
s
caprices
and
he
could
not
forget
the
tragedy
of
the
woman
he
loved
which
might
almost
be
laid
at
his
door
you
do
not
mind
my
keesing
you
she
asked
no
i
like
it
said
horton
with
a
laugh
but
piquette
knew
life
in
the
streets
of
paris
had
given
her
a
sense
of
the
fourth
dimension
and
curiously
enough
her
prescience
only
quieted
her
made
her
a
little
graver
matching
her
mood
to
his
he
provided
a
new
sensation
this
outcast
hero
who
owed
her
his
life
and
yet
was
to
pay
her
only
in
gratitude
jim
horton
was
penniless
for
with
an
irony
not
lost
on
him
the
money
he
had
gotten
from
the
bank
had
gone
to
pay
tricot
and
their
price
for
his
knock
on
the
head
the
clothing
he
found
himself
in
had
been
none
too
good
when
harry
had
worn
it
and
the
incarceration
in
the
filthy
cellar
had
done
nothing
to
improve
it
outcast
he
might
be
but
he
meant
while
he
had
money
in
bank
at
least
to
look
presentable
so
piquette
got
him
a
blank
check
from
the
bank
which
he
made
out
and
piquette
cashed
and
the
next
day
when
he
was
able
to
go
out
he
bought
himself
a
suit
he
came
back
in
the
afternoon
and
with
much
pride
exhibited
his
purchase
she
gave
the
clothing
her
approval
and
then
shrugged
an
now
jeem
you
will
be
going
away
est
ce
is
it
not
better
piquette
i
have
not
the
honor
of
monsieur
de
vautrin
s
acquaintance
oh
she
said
with
a
quick
gesture
est
he
would
never
know
jim
horton
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
made
her
look
in
his
eyes
that
s
not
the
way
piquette
you
are
too
fine
not
to
see
i
can
t
be
an
object
of
your
charity
any
it
s
charity
i
owe
you
my
life
i
want
to
not
like
this
i
want
you
to
see
my
gratitude
in
my
eyes
the
depth
of
my
friendship
i
want
you
to
know
that
what
you
ve
done
for
me
has
given
a
new
meaning
to
courage
and
unselfishness
she
turned
her
head
away
as
he
paused
and
then
gently
took
his
hands
from
her
shoulders
i
can
pay
piquette
he
insisted
quietly
you
do
not
love
the
duc
de
vautrin
come
away
from
here
with
me
i
have
a
little
money
i
can
get
more
from
america

will
find
you
a
place
in
the
where
you
will
be
happy
until
you
have
the
home

and
she
faltered
what
i
do
doesn
t
matter
an
she
started
you
will
leave
paris
i
do
not
know
she
released
her
fingers
quickly
and
went
to
the
window
looking
over
the
rooftops
in
a
long
significant
moment
of
silence
and
de
oder
she
spoke
the
words
distinctly
and
yet
he
thought
he
must
have
misunderstood
piquette
what
appens
between
you
an
your
brother
s
wife
she
asked
quietly
he
had
no
reply
and
while
he
hesitated
she
turned
slowly
and
faced
him
i
know
she
said
with
a
smile
i
ave
known
it
from
de
firs
you
love
er
est
it
is
a
pity
she
is
ver
beautiful
dey
say
i
am
a
fool
piquette
you
are
not
de
firs
in
de
worl
he
sank
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
wondering
at
his
own
confession
i
was
sorry
for
her
innocence
married
to
a
man
like
that
she
was
kind
to
me
i
played
the
part
and
kept
silence
they
were
going
to
use
her
off
as
de
vautrin
s
he
paused
and
looked
up
at
piquette
aware
that
the
topic
that
he
had
not
dared
to
broach
now
suddenly
loomed
between
them
piquette
faced
him
gravely
yes
she
said
and
the
rising
inflection
was
very
gentle
i
do
not
know
what
you
wish
to
do
piquette
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
but
before
i
was
hurt
i
had
planned
to
find
out
all
the
facts
of
this
conspiracy
and
tell
both
harry
s
wife
and
the
duc
de
vautrin
you
have
given
me
the
facts
do
you
want
me
to
use
them
piquette
was
silent
a
moment
regarding
him
with
a
smile
well
as
anyt
ing
appen
to
make
you
change
your
mind
he
looked
up
at
her
in
wonder
piquette
i
he
began
but
she
broke
in
lightly
you

all

what
you

but
it
is
a
difficult
game

horton
paced
the
room
slowly
in
deep
abstraction
but
in
a
moment
stopped
before
her
and
caught
her
hands
in
his
piquette
he
said
gravely
you
were
in
this
don
t
know
why
or
how
because
a
woman
with
a
soul
as
big
as
yours
oughtn
t
to
be
stooping
to
this
kind
of
rottenness
for
a
long
while
she
made
no
reply
but
she
turned
her
head
away
and
looked
out
of
the
window
i
can
t
change
de
way
i
was
born
jeem
orton
she
said
quietly
he
was
silent
aware
of
the
false
situation
and
thinking
deeply
i
ve
got
to
tell
her
the
truth
piquette
he
said
at
last
another
moment
of
silence
and
then
piquette
turned
toward
him
both
arms
outstretched
you
are
right
jeem
you
s
all
go
to
er
and
tell
ne
me

jim
horton
had
risen
and
put
his
arms
around
her
turning
her
face
up
to
his
and
kissing
her
gently
she
made
no
resistance
but
she
did
not
return
his
caress
you
are
too
good
for
him
piquette
she
stirred
uneasily
in
his
arms
and
then
released
herself
go
she
said
go
will
you
meet
me
at
javet
s
yes
revoir
mon
she
watched
him
go
down
the
stair
and
then
turned
in
at
the
door
of
her
own
apartment
jim
horton
was
no
squire
of
dames
but
he
couldn
t
be
unaware
of
the
attractions
of
this
lovely
pagan
like
her
he
was
an
outcast
and
their
ways
perhaps
lay
along
the
same
paths
to
oblivion
but
before
he
started
down
that
road
he
had
a
duty
still
to
perform
a
wrong
to
set
right
and
he
meant
to
do
it
without
delay
if
harry
had
succeeded
in
ingratiating
himself
with
moira
he
knew
that
she
must
despise
him
for
his
betrayal
of
her
credulity
but
he
meant
to
seek
her
out
just
the
same
and
tell
her
the
truth
about
barry
quinlevin
as
he
knew
it
he
wanted
to
see
her
this
once
in
order
to
try
and
justify
himself
in
her
eyes
for
his
imposture
and
then
he
would
didn
t
much
care
where
but
he
realized
as
he
crossed
the
river
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
an
easy
matter
to
reach
her
unobserved
he
knew
that
harry
must
be
passing
some
uneasy
moments
and
it
was
better
that
harry
didn
t
see
him
just
yet
but
there
was
the
watchful
madame
toupin
to
pass
and
it
was
still
half
an
hour
until
dusk
when
he
hoped
to
slip
through
the
gate
and
up
the
stairs
meanwhile
he
found
himself
a
lodging
in
an
obscure
street
and
then
with
his
pulled
down
walked
into
the
rue
de
tavennes
and
boldly
approached
the
familiar
gate
madame
horton
he
asked
she
is
in
do
you
know
the
way
nothing
could
have
been
more
simple
madame
toupin
had
pulled
the
latch
without
even
looking
up
at
him
it
all
seemed
like
a
horrible
dream
to
revelation
of
harry
s
prison
by
the
river
the
police
the
escape
of
jim
horton
with
the
unknown
woman
the
homeward
ride
with
the
police
officer
and
the
night
in
the
with
locked
doors
for
harry
s
return
until
at
last
through
sheer
exhaustion
of
mind
and
body
she
had
fallen
asleep
and
then
the
visit
the
next
day
of
the
police
officer
the
questions
that
she
had
to
answer
but
he
got
nothing
from
her
beyond
the
mere
skeleton
of
the
tale
which
she
had
given
the
night
before
she
wouldn
t
tell
how
she
got
to
the
rue
charron
some
instinct
still
sealing
her
lips
as
to
her
husband
s
share
in
the
adventure
and
inventing
a
tale
that
seemed
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
interview
no
crime
had
been
actually
committed
though
all
the
circumstances
were
suspicious
the
officer
told
her
that
a
search
would
be
made
for
the
man
named
tricot
and
that
madame
horton
should
hold
herself
in
readiness
to
appear
against
him
if
necessary
at
some
future
time
the
return
of
harry
horton
her
husband
the
next
afternoon
contrite
and
humility
itself
was
unpleasant
but
they
reached
an
understanding
pending
the
return
of
barry
quinlevin
from
ireland
she
kept
the
secret
of
her
visit
to
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
and
her
knowledge
of
the
escape
of
the
prisoner
she
saw
that
her
husband
was
worried
and
furtive
and
she
had
no
difficulty
in
exacting
from
him
a
promise
not
to
molest
her
in
return
she
promised
silence
and
he
departed
with
every
protestation
of
friendship
and
good
will
somewhat
reassured
as
to
her
intentions
as
to
jim
horton
the
twin
brother
who
had
worked
such
havoc
in
her
life
moira
was
very
much
troubled
and
disturbed
the
hurt
to
her
pride
was
grievous
but
the
joy
she
had
in
the
very
thought
of
him
seemed
to
assuage
all
wounds
she
knew
now
that
if
he
had
died
in
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
that
night
she
would
have
worshiped
him
all
her
life
as
a
martyr
to
their
unfortunate
affection
and
the
memories
of
jim
horton
s
tenderness
on
the
day
of
their
parting
the
gentleness
of
his
abnegation
his
struggle
against
the
temptation
of
her
these
thoughts
of
him
obliterating
the
horrors
that
had
followed
returned
and
engulfed
her
with
pity
their
love
had
seemed
so
perfect
a
thing
but
mockery
she
felt
very
friendless
in
the
big
studio
very
much
alone
and
she
confess
to
her
father
her
love
for
this
brother
who
had
come
in
and
taken
harry
s
place
the
hurt
to
her
pride
burned
again
angrily
her
father
like
herself
had
been
deceived
by
the
brother
at
the
hospital
and
what
sympathy
could
she
expect
from
him
he
would
be
furious
at
the
deception
that
had
been
practiced
upon
them
both
and
would
perhaps
take
harry
s
part
against
her
moira
clenched
her
hands
and
stared
long
into
the
gray
cinders
of
the
fireplace
if
it
was
to
be
war
she
would
fight
she
had
married
harry
in
a
moment
of
pity
because
her
father
had
wished
it
but
the
understanding
had
been
definite
and
now
she
would
rather
run
from
her
to
fulfill
the
terrible
vows
she
had
taken
jim
wanted
to
hear
his
side
of
the
story
reviving
faith
in
him
made
her
sure
that
if
he
were
alive
he
would
come
to
her
and
tell
her
everything
a
cautious
step
on
the
stair
knock
she
went
over
quickly
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
opened
the
door
then
stood
staring
unable
to
speak
it
s
i
moira
said
jim
horton
gently
she
faltered
i
said
that
i
would
come
back
but
was
detained
he
said
coolly
if
he
had
expected
her
to
be
surprised
at
his
appearance
out
of
uniform
she
gave
no
sign
of
it
she
opened
wide
the
door
and
stood
aside
know
she
murmured
i
won
t
stay
long
but
there
were
some
things
i
wanted
you
to
facts
in
extenuation
of
my
conduct
that
may
make
you
think
less
bitterly
of
you
look
ill
she
said
staring
at
him
it
is
all
too
horrible
to
think
horrible
if
you
like
he
said
slowly
misinterpreting
her
meaning
but
done
in
a
weak
moment
with
a
good
oh
not
that
i
mean
what
they
did
to
danger
you
passed
you
know
of
that
yes
i
followed
harry
and
got
the
it
was
you
good
god
it
was
the
least
that
i
could
i
found
had
happened
he
stared
at
her
in
incomprehension
you
mean
that
he
confessed
to
you
she
nodded
and
then
laughed
nervously
i
don
t
know
why
i
should
be
keeping
you
standing
on
the
a
model
if
you
ve
much
to
say
you
d
better
say
it
sitting
jim
horton
he
started
and
stared
at
her
but
she
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
led
the
way
with
an
assumption
of
carelessness
to
the
chairs
by
the
dead
fire
as
though
aware
of
its
symbolism
you
truth
she
shrugged
what
my
told
me
no
less
he
marveled
at
her
ease
at
the
cruelty
of
her
chosen
phrases
and
yet
he
could
not
cavil
at
them
it
was
clear
that
she
meant
that
there
were
to
be
no
further
misunderstandings
that
she
was
shifting
the
burden
to
his
shoulders
where
it
belonged
the
sense
of
his
culpability
weighed
upon
him
and
he
did
not
look
at
her
and
so
he
missed
the
quick
anxious
sensitive
glances
that
searched
his
face
for
the
truth
in
his
heart
but
he
bent
his
head
forward
and
stared
into
the
ashes
that
had
glowed
so
warmly
a
few
nights
ago
i
have
come
to
speak
the
truth
he
began
his
voice
deep
resonant
and
trembling
with
his
emotion
a
visit
of
confession
and
it
s
rather
late
isn
t
it
she
said
in
a
hard
little
voice
that
he
scarcely
recognized
as
her
own
he
knew
that
he
deserved
this
of
her
and
more
but
it
cut
him
none
the
less
i
will
tell
you
the
truth
he
went
on
firmly
and
then
you
shall
judge
for
yourself
i
owe
it
to
you
to
tell
the
facts
but
i
owe
it
to
myself
too
she
nodded
and
sat
and
so
quietly
neglecting
no
detail
he
told
her
of
harry
from
the
moment
of
their
meeting
on
the
battlefield
until
they
had
met
outside
in
the
rue
de
tavennes
he
heard
moira
gasp
at
the
mention
of
harry
s
cowardice
but
he
went
on
to
the
end
without
pause
something
of
what
followed
you
know
he
went
on
quietly
i
tried
to
tell
them
the
truth
in
the
hospital
i
said
i
wasn
t
harry
horton
they
didn
t
believe
me
they
thought
i
was
still
out
of
my
head
and
so
i
lay
there
for
a
while
silent
i
think
i
must
have
been
pretty
weak
he
paused
a
moment
to
gather
his
thoughts
there
were
some
letters
to
harry
i
had
no
right
to
read
them
but
i
did
a
letter
from
you
to
your
what
a
farce
it
was
a
letter
from
barry
he
paused
and
frowned
it
was
an
invasion
of
your
you
were
nothing
to
i
was
sure
that
i
would
never
meet
you
i
thought
that
i
would
wait
a
few
days
before
i
tried
to
tell
the
officers
of
the
hospital
who
i
was
it
was
a
hard
thing
to
it
meant
that
i
would
have
to
pay
the
penalty
of
a
military
crime
but
sure
after
what
you
d
done
moira
s
voice
broke
in
clearly
they
couldn
t
be
punishing
disgraceful
for
penalty
of
desertion
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
you
see
there
were
two
of
us
to
consider
yes
i
understand
then
you
warning
his
voice
sank
to
a
deep
murmur
and
he
bent
his
head
it
was
a
moment
for
a
decision
i
hadn
t
it
i
was
weak
i
let
you
believe
that
i
was
your
husband
seemed
the
easiest
way
just
then
god
knows
i
meant
you
no
harm
and
god
knows
i
ve
suffered
for
it
he
rose
and
leaned
upon
the
mantel
his
face
turned
away
from
her
summoning
courage
for
the
harder
thing
that
he
still
had
to
say
and
there
s
something
else
that
made
me
do
what
i
he
began
something
more
he
heard
her
question
what
do
you
mean
he
paused
a
moment
it
s
hard
to
tell
i
must
and
then
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
duc
de
vautrin
he
asked
yes
she
uttered
in
bewildered
tone
the
name
is
familiar
to
me
but
mentioned
him
yes
i
think
so
a
man
he
met
many
years
ago
in
ireland
but
why
do
you
ask
because
his
life
and
yours
are
bound
up
in
each
mine
he
paused
painfully
moira
perhaps
i
m
breaking
all
the
ties
in
your
life
that
you
had
thought
most
sacred
but
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
what
i
know
i
don
t
frighten
god
knows
i
ve
given
you
pain
enough
already
i
m
a
bird
of
but
i
m
going
to
go
on
if
you
ll
let
me
she
sat
motionless
her
strained
white
hands
gripping
the
chair
arm
under
the
cover
of
the
dressing
table
in
the
room
there
where
i
slept
are
the
two
letters
that
i
read
in
my
bed
in
the
one
from
one
from
barry
quinlevin
i
left
them
there
when
i
went
away
unless
some
one
has
removed
them
they
should
be
there
in
obedience
to
the
suggestion
she
rose
and
went
quickly
out
into
the
hall
and
into
the
deserted
room
harry
had
not
entered
it
nor
had
she
even
told
him
of
the
valises
containing
his
impedimenta
that
had
been
sent
down
from
headquarters
the
letters
were
there
trembling
with
uncertainty
she
found
them
and
glanced
at
the
familiar
handwriting
her
own
and
her
father
s
and
then
came
back
to
the
door
of
the
studio
there
she
stood
a
moment
weighing
the
letters
in
her
hands
jim
horton
stood
as
she
had
left
him
leaning
upon
the
his
gaze
upon
the
extinguished
fire
it
seemed
that
lost
in
his
own
gloomy
reverie
he
had
already
forgotten
her
never
in
all
the
weeks
that
she
had
known
him
not
even
when
he
had
lain
in
his
hospital
he
seemed
a
more
pitiful
figure
than
her
as
help
him
what
did
it
matter
what
this
letter
contained
in
her
heart
she
knew
that
the
only
thing
that
mattered
to
her
was
the
love
that
this
man
bore
her
she
had
recognized
it
in
the
deep
tones
of
his
voice
which
had
thrilled
her
again
and
in
the
attitude
of
submission
which
had
anticipated
the
change
in
her
sentiments
it
was
a
moment
for
decisions
like
his
moment
in
the
hospital
she
had
only
to
tell
him
to
go
and
she
knew
that
he
would
have
obeyed
her
but
like
jim
horton
she
no
longer
had
the
strength
some
instinct
told
her
that
here
in
this
outcast
splendid
a
rock
that
she
could
cling
to
she
glanced
over
the
stair
and
then
entering
the
studio
quietly
slowly
approached
him
letters
in
hand
you
wish
me
to
she
asked
yes
please
moira
she
glanced
at
him
and
then
sank
into
the
armchair
and
opened
barry
quinlevin
s
letter
for
a
long
while
there
was
no
sound
but
the
rustle
of
the
paper
in
her
fingers
at
last
he
heard
her
stir
slightly
and
glanced
up
at
her
her
face
was
deathly
pale
my
the
money
has
stopped
coming
does
it
all
mean
she
asked
and
what
are
those
papers
what
is
the
agency
working
against
him
and
what
does
he
mean
by
putting
the
screws
on
it
means
that
barry
quinlevin
blackmailing
the
duc
de
been
doing
so
for
years
he
said
in
a
suppressed
tone
she
rose
and
faced
him
her
breast
heaving
blackmail
my
he
bowed
his
head
unfortunately
it
s
the
truth
he
spoke
to
me
of
it
in
the
i
was
she
raised
the
letter
again
and
read
i
can
t
can
but
her
words
trailed
off
into
silence
as
she
read
again
the
damning
phrases
his
heart
was
full
of
tenderness
and
pity
for
her
and
he
caught
her
by
the
hand
moira
dear
he
murmured
i
wouldn
t
have
spoken
of
are
couldn
t
understand
for
a
long
while
they
re
using
you
as
a
cat
perhaps
you
don
t
even
know
the
meaning
of
the
s
too
hideous
using
she
seemed
unaware
of
her
fingers
still
in
his
how
can
they
use
i
know
nothing
whatever
of
this
affair
he
led
her
to
her
chair
again
and
made
her
sit
listen
he
said
gently
and
i
will
tell
you
all
that
i
ve
found
out
about
i
can
t
has
told
you
piquette
her
brows
drew
a
friend
your
husband
s
he
said
it
was
she
who
first
discovered
our
dual
identity
in
the
caf√©
friend
of
harry
took
pity
on
me
the
you
to
escape
she
gasped
awakening
yes
she
shared
the
secrets
of
this
intrigue
and
when
they
knocked
me
out
she
guessed
the
truth
found
out
where
they
had
put
me
and
went
in
through
the
passage
from
the
river
it
was
she
who
took
me
back
to
her
apartment
and
nursed
me
oh
she
faltered
see
but
what
reason
have
you
to
believe
that
she
speaks
the
truth
he
had
taken
his
place
by
the
mantel
again
had
already
proved
it
by
the
mouth
of
harry
himself
he
broke
off
and
met
her
piteous
eyes
squarely
oh
i
wouldn
t
have
cared
what
they
did
if
you
hadn
t
been
a
part
of
the
plan
i
would
have
told
you
who
i
was
the
other
night
and
but
it
was
too
cruel
barry
quinlevin
is
a
strange
man
he
loves
he
wants
to
see
you
he
became
desperate
when
the
source
of
his
income
was
cut
the
irish
there
were
no
irish
rents
moira
the
source
of
his
income
all
these
duc
de
money
paid
to
keep
a
holy
then
she
paused
bewildered
by
the
very
terror
of
her
thoughts
listen
moira
you
must
know
it
all
as
nearly
as
i
can
get
it
the
story
is
this
years
ago
the
duc
de
vautrin
married
an
irish
heiress
from
athlone
in
galway
named
mary
callonby
receiving
with
her
her
immense
with
the
provision
from
her
father
s
will
that
if
any
child
was
born
the
fortune
should
go
to
that
child
in
the
event
of
the
mother
s
death
callonby
whispered
moira
half
to
herself
athlone
the
duc
de
vautrin
was
a
beast
and
mistreated
his
wife
so
that
she
ran
away
from
him
into
ireland
where
a
daughter
was
born
to
callonby
dying
in
childbirth
and
then
softly
do
you
follow
me
moira
it
s
very
important
i
m
follow
you
she
murmured
painfully
when
mary
callonby
left
the
duc
de
vautrin
went
upon
a
voyage
around
the
world
enjoying
himself
with
her
money
for
two
years
and
unaware
of
the
death
of
his
wife
or
of
the
birth
of
his
little
daughter
who
was
cared
for
and
nursed
by
a
woman
named
nora
nora
burke
moira
had
started
up
suddenly
in
her
chair
her
eyes
wide
with
sudden
comprehension
you
remember
he
said
my
old
yes
it
s
here
that
the
story
involves
your
fortunes
barry
quinlevin
s
the
infant
daughter
of
the
duc
de
vautrin
died
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
without
his
being
aware
of
his
even
being
aware
that
a
daughter
had
been
born
the
death
of
this
child
was
kept
a
but
why
why
pleaded
moira
a
glimmering
of
the
intrigue
coming
to
her
jim
horton
turned
away
again
because
it
was
necessary
that
the
duc
de
vautrin
should
remain
in
ignorance
of
it
holy
virgin
you
mean
that
nora
burke
and
barry
quinlevin
you
were
of
the
same
age
as
the
child
of
the
duc
de
vautrin
there
were
few
neighbors
your
mother
had
also
died
in
childbirth
nora
burke
came
into
barry
quinlevin
s
house
as
nurse
oh
it
is
impossible
gasped
moira
i
can
can
t
believe
it
it
is
what
i
m
to
help
you
to
prove
but
there
must
be
perhaps
i
don
t
know
moira
all
of
these
things
seem
uncertain
the
idea
is
that
barry
quinlevin
taking
pity
on
the
fatherless
child
of
the
duc
and
mourning
his
own
child
that
had
died
had
brought
the
little
girl
into
his
own
house
to
keep
her
until
the
duc
s
oh
it
is
infamous
that
was
the
way
nora
burke
came
into
the
house
of
barry
quinlevin
and
that
was
the
way
you
became
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
mary
callonby
heiress
he
nodded
i
do
not
know
all
the
facts
but
it
seems
that
when
the
duc
de
vautrin
returned
to
paris
he
was
met
by
barry
quinlevin
with
proofs
of
his
daughter
s
existence
it
was
to
the
duc
s
interest
to
keep
the
matter
secret
since
the
income
from
the
callonby
fortune
which
he
enjoyed
would
of
course
go
to
the
child
and
from
that
day
to
this
the
matter
has
been
kept
a
secret
and
barry
quinlevin
has
been
paid
for
keeping
it
moira
had
risen
and
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
studio
it
is
too
bewilders
me
who
told
you
all
this
piquette
told
her
his
interests
and
yours
were
the
same
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
for
a
moment
wait
she
gasped
i
must
so
jim
horton
was
silent
watching
her
anguish
with
pity
and
anxiety
but
at
last
she
grew
calmer
and
sank
into
the
chair
reading
barry
quinlevin
s
letter
to
harry
again
and
yet
this
might
refer
to
she
pleaded
catching
at
any
straw
that
would
save
her
from
this
disgrace
he
shook
his
head
i
wish
i
could
reassure
i
can
t
the
facts
are
too
clear
she
was
silent
a
moment
breathing
hard
it
was
terrible
for
to
have
to
tell
me
this
you
understand
that
i
had
to
don
t
you
she
bowed
her
head
and
he
went
on
and
now
i
only
want
you
to
tell
me
how
i
can
help
i
can
make
things
what
shall
i
do
what
can
she
halted
again
intimidated
at
the
thought
of
her
father
and
if
i
were
only
sure
of
course
the
duc
de
vautrin
must
be
told
at
once
there
s
no
hurry
you
must
think
it
over
verify
my
statements
when
you
yes
yes
i
refute
them
i
see
that
i
want
to
help
you
i
ll
do
yes
i
she
paused
again
whom
can
i
trust
now
he
caught
her
fingers
and
pressed
them
softly
to
his
lips
it
is
a
terrible
situation
for
you
can
t
go
on
as
a
partner
in
this
no
of
must
be
finding
my
and
then
turning
to
him
whom
can
i
it
s
you
he
relinquished
her
fingers
and
turned
away
i
deceived
you
that
doesn
t
matter
you
you
will
forgive
me
he
leaned
forward
toward
her
searching
her
face
eagerly
she
whispered
moira
god
help
me
i
ve
the
need
of
you
he
fell
to
his
knees
beside
the
chair
and
took
her
in
his
arms
her
trouble
was
so
crisis
in
her
life
so
tragic
i
ve
tried
to
make
myself
believe
i
didn
t
she
went
on
whispering
that
everything
should
be
as
it
was
before
you
came
i
you
poor
but
in
spite
of
spite
of
faith
in
you
is
just
the
same
thank
god
for
that
we
must
find
a
way
but
she
shook
her
head
no
there
s
no
way
m
sure
of
you
it
s
but
she
did
not
refuse
him
her
lips
now
and
he
held
her
close
in
his
arms
moira
he
whispered
it
was
meant
to
be
it
s
wrong
she
repeated
and
then
with
a
sigh
its
very
he
touched
her
brow
tenderly
with
his
lips
and
then
gently
released
her
do
you
want
me
to
go
but
her
fingers
still
held
him
just
yet
jim
this
is
our
and
mine
and
i
ve
been
wanting
you

me
but
i
m
a
nondescript
outcast
the
cruelty
of
it
you
i
got
what
i
deserved
he
said
with
a
smile
and
harry
i
can
t
be
staying
here
if
he
s
going
to
be
here
jim
the
very
touch
of
his
fingers
the
sight
of
him
knowing
what
i
he
won
t
would
have
him
and
give
yourself
up
to
the
military
police
no

be
thinking
of
that
i
m
not
afraid
of
of
my
father

t
be
disgracing

i
think
of

wrong

love

been
so
beautiful
jim
it

t
be

a
hideous
a
marriage
just
the
same
you

t
be
tied
to
this
man
i
tied
to
him
oh
she
broke
off
in
her
despair

it
more
t
be
pleading
with
me
for

impossible

i
can
i
ll
have
patience
some
no
dear
that
s
the
worst
of
it
it
can
t
be
ever
i
have
she
stopped
and
they
both
listened
moira
from
somewhere
down
the
stairway
outside
came
the
sounds
of
a
laugh
and
of
voices
in
conversation
harry
she
gasped
and
with
quick
presence
of
mind
ran
to
the
door
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
then
listened
my
father
they
mustn
t
find
you
here
yes
said
jim
coolly
i
think
we
d
better
have
this
thing
and
now
she
whispered
tensely
it
would
be
the
end
of
all
things
not
yet
i
must
have
time
to
already
there
was
a
knock
upon
the
door
moira
had
caught
jim
by
the
arm
and
was
hurrying
him
toward
a
closet
in
the
corner
of
the
room
in
here
quickly
she
whispered
you
must
my
father
will
go
in
the
other
rooms
but
as
you
love
she
pleaded
pushing
him
in
shutting
the
door
then
breathless
she
turned
and
faced
the
door
into
the
hallway
a
moment
longer
she
waited
summoning
calm
and
resolution
when
the
knocking
on
the
door
began
again
and
her
name
was
called
coming
she
replied
looking
around
the
studio
keenly
and
then
catching
sight
of
jim
horton
s
hat
whisked
it
under
the
couch
and
then
opened
the
door
barry
quinlevin
came
in
harry
carrying
his
bag
with
a
gay
laugh
he
caught
moira
into
his
arms
well
s
joyful
i
am
to
be
back
dusty
and
unwashed
but
none
the
less
glad
to
be
here
how
are
ye
child
by
the
amount
of
time
ye
took
opening
the
door
i
thought
ye
might
be
i
m
very
she
murmured
i
ve
not
been
up
to
the
he
held
her
off
and
looked
at
her
in
the
dim
light
from
the
gas
jet
a
little
much
moping
in
the
dark
let
s
have
some
a
drink
of
the
irish
twill
do
none
of
us
harm
he
moved
into
the
studio
and
harry
horton
set
the
bag
down
did
you
have
a
successful
trip
asked
moira
putting
more
color
into
her
voice
than
she
felt
so
so
said
quinlevin
a
bottle
some
glasses
and
water
and
when
she
had
obeyed
very
sight
of
it
s
already
making
a
new
man
of
me
harry
health
moira
sat
and
listened
while
he
described
the
incidents
of
his
trip
harry
could
not
meet
her
look
but
she
saw
that
he
drank
sparingly
as
for
her
father
she
watched
him
in
silence
aware
of
his
flamboyant
grace
and
charm
again
incredulous
as
to
the
things
she
knew
of
him
but
his
letter
to
harry
in
her
shirtwaist
seemed
to
be
burning
the
fair
skin
of
her
breast
to
remind
her
of
his
venality
on
his
way
to
the
bottle
he
pinched
her
pale
cheeks
between
his
long
fingers
where
s
yer
spirit
girl
ye
look
as
though
ye
d
been
hearing
a
banshee
a
fine
husband
ye
ve
got
and
all
to
be
putting
lilies
in
yer
cheeks
instead
of
roses
she
stays
in
the
studio
too
much
put
in
harry
uneasily
a
good
jumper
and
a
few
stone
walls
of
county
galway
would
set
ye
right
in
a
jiffy
we
ll
be
taking
ye
there
one
day
soon
i
m
thinking
if
ye
don
t
come
to
life
what
is
it
child
m
just
tired
he
took
his
glass
and
held
it
to
the
light
with
a
critical
air
maybe
it
s
better
if
ye
go
to
bed
then
i
ll
just
clean
up
a
bit
and
then
come
back
and
have
a
talk
with
you
harry
boy
and
finishing
his
glass
he
took
up
his
bag
and
went
into
his
room
to
cleanse
himself
leaving
moira
alone
with
harry
she
was
very
uncomfortable
and
sat
wondering
what
ruse
she
could
find
to
get
rid
of
them
harry
fumbled
at
his
glass
nervously
you
re
going
to
tell
him
he
asked
she
shrugged
of
course
she
said
coolly
the
farce
has
gone
on
long
enough
yes
he
muttered
perhaps
you
re
right
i
ll
tell
thanks
she
said
quietly
it
would
be
better
they
seemed
to
have
very
little
to
say
she
saw
harry
furtively
looking
at
her
but
she
was
oblivious
of
him
for
her
thoughts
were
beyond
him
over
his
head
in
the
paint
closet
where
jim
horton
sat
uncomfortably
awaiting
the
moment
of
release
but
how
could
she
effect
it
now
it
seemed
almost
enough
of
luck
to
have
hidden
jim
horton
s
hat
before
they
had
entered
she
knew
that
his
predicament
was
hardly
to
his
liking
and
in
spite
of
her
entreaties
feared
that
any
moment
he
might
be
opening
the
door
and
facing
the
situation
and
when
barry
quinlevin
returned
to
the
room
in
a
moment
his
face
shining
with
his
vigorous
ablutions
any
immediate
hopes
she
may
have
had
of
jim
s
release
were
dashed
to
the
ground
ye
d
better
be
going
to
yer
room
child
and
get
yer
beauty
sleep
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
harry
that
he
wanted
to
be
alone
with
her
husband
was
evident
and
the
request
was
something
in
the
nature
of
a
command
still
wondering
what
she
had
better
do
she
got
up
and
moved
slowly
toward
the
door
into
the
kitchen
they
would
would
watch
at
the
door
and
listen
very
well
she
said
languidly
perhaps
i
ll
feel
better
if
i
lie
down
for
and
went
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
her
but
she
did
not
go
into
her
room
all
alive
with
uncertainty
and
apprehension
she
crouched
by
the
door
listening
intently
the
keyhole
was
large
through
it
she
could
see
the
closet
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
studio
where
jim
was
concealed
and
what
they
said
she
could
hear
distinctly
well
harry
boy
said
quinlevin
here
we
are
again
and
with
nora
close
at
hand
ready
for
the
there
can
t
be
any
haggling
or
boggling
now
a
clean
million
we
ll
get
from
it
or
my
name
s
not
did
you
have
any
trouble
getting
nora
to
come
a
five
thousand
pounds
settles
her
business
nora
was
always
a
bit
of
rogue
but
she
couldn
t
deny
real
genius
and
then
a
bit
of
but
the
birth
producing
his
pocket
case
a
little
mildewed
and
rumpled
from
hiding
in
the
mattresses
and
the
like
but
still
quite
legible
see
little
hard
to
read
ye
see
patricia
it
is
patricia
madeleine
aulnay
de
vautrin
female
me
boy
born
august
in
the
year
of
our
lord
by
the
attested
by
the
parish
little
illegible
in
certain
notable
places
but
all
quite
straight
and
proper
he
can
t
go
back
of
that
and
the
other
dead
as
a
fortnight
ll
admit
most
i
can
t
keep
the
whole
of
county
galway
under
my
hat
harry
horton
frowned
no
and
you
can
t
keep
moira
there
either
what
d
ye
mean
merely
that
she
ll
put
a
spoke
in
your
wheel
if
you
re
not
careful
quinlevin
laughed
i
won
t
worry
about
that
bridge
until
i
come
to
it
she
won
t
object
to
taking
her
place
in
the
world
as
the
duchesse
de
he
broke
off
abruptly
what
s
that
did
moira
call
i
didn
t
hear
anything
i
ve
got
the
fidgets
then
i
d
be
having
to
give
her
up
if
monsieur
the
duc
should
take
a
fancy
to
ye
needn
t
fear
he
won
t
he
s
too
and
well
out
of
it
at
a
million
francs
ah
he
ll
wriggle
and
squirm
a
bit
on
the
hook
but
he
ll
pay
in
the
we
ll
gaff
him
for
the
whole
estate
he
stopped
and
carefully
cut
the
end
from
a
cigar
d
ye
think
by
any
chance
that
piquette
morin
could
have
done
any
talking
why
do
you
ask
because
four
months
ago
monsieur
the
duc
was
in
ireland
asking
questions
who
told
you
this
nora
burke
he
got
nothing
from
her
she
knew
which
side
her
bread
was
buttered
on
but
that
s
what
made
her
squeamish
when
my
allowance
stopped
coming
to
her
i
see
and
you
ve
paid
her
something
yes
and
the
devil
s
own
time
i
had
getting
it
together
i
m
thinking
i
ve
squared
accounts
with
you
already
in
all
this
business
but
harry
horton
had
gotten
up
and
poured
himself
out
a
stiff
drink
of
the
whisky
which
he
drained
hurriedly
i
don
t
like
it
he
muttered
uneasily
what
this
de
vautrin
business
quinlevin
calmly
stared
at
him
yer
feet
aren
t
getting
cold
now
harry
took
a
pace
or
two
trying
to
find
his
words
and
then
things
haven
t
been
going
right
you
left
i
see
said
quinlevin
with
a
shrug
you
and
moira
haven
t
been
hitting
it
no
and
it
s
worse
than
that
barry
quinlevin
leaned
forward
his
shaggy
brows
thatched
unpleasantly
what
the
devil
are
ye
talking
about
ve
got
to
tell
you
ye
d
be
obliging
me
if
ye
would
harry
met
the
sharp
look
of
the
older
man
and
then
his
gaze
flickered
and
fell
as
he
sank
into
his
chair
again
ve
heard
me
speak
of
my
twin
brother
jim
he
asked
after
a
moment
the
railroad
man
ye
quarreled
with
over
the
trifling
matter
of
an
estate
well
what
of
him
he
s
turned
what
have
you
got
to
do
with
him
more
than
you
think
i
ve
got
to
tell
you
what
has
it
s
plenty
it
s
been
and
repeat
him
at
least
laughed
the
irishman
he
seems
to
have
gained
no
new
place
in
yer
affection
will
he
in
yours
when
you
have
the
facts
go
on
i
m
listening
and
slowly
halting
here
and
there
for
a
word
or
a
phrase
that
would
put
a
better
construction
on
his
own
share
in
the
affair
he
told
quinlevin
of
the
substitution
of
jim
horton
for
himself
and
of
the
events
that
had
followed
including
his
return
to
paris
and
the
desperate
means
he
had
taken
to
regain
his
own
identity
of
moira
he
spoke
nothing
but
as
the
situation
was
revealed
with
all
its
hazards
to
the
success
of
their
intrigue
from
an
attitude
of
polite
attention
with
which
he
had
listened
at
first
quinlevin
became
eagerly
and
anxiously
absorbed
interjecting
question
after
question
while
his
iridescent
eyes
glowed
under
his
frowning
brows
and
his
long
bony
fingers
clutched
his
chair
arm
by
degrees
the
full
meaning
of
the
revelation
came
to
relation
to
harry
s
future
to
the
matter
of
the
duc
to
moira
but
as
he
grew
more
furious
he
grew
more
pale
more
calm
and
listened
in
a
silence
punctuated
by
brief
questions
to
the
conclusion
of
the
story
a
little
contemptuous
of
the
nervousness
of
his
companion
reading
below
the
thin
veneer
of
braggadocio
the
meanings
that
the
younger
man
strove
to
conceal
so
he
said
coolly
ye
ve
gone
and
let
us
all
in
for
a
nice
mess
of
broth
humph
and
ye
ll
let
a
man
be
tearing
the
uniform
off
yer
very
yer
honors
for
ye
he
rose
and
stood
at
his
full
height
looking
down
at
the
figure
in
the
opposite
chair
and
he
asked
he
this
he
left
the
she
did
not
guess
nor
you
said
harry
with
some
spirit
since
you
invited
him
true
for
cess
to
him
he
broke
off
and
took
a
pace
toward
the
lay
figure
in
the
corner
and
back
and
then
this
is
a
bad
business
he
said
soberly
and
ye
don
t
know
where
he
is
at
the
present
moment
no
he
got
away
clean
through
a
passage
to
the
you
ve
no
idea
who
helped
him
no
and
tricot
s
no
but
they
lack
harry
horton
aroused
himself
he
was
drugged
i
tell
the
limit
i
saw
him
before
i
came
here
to
see
moira
he
was
clean
out
tricot
was
for
dropping
him
into
the
river
when
we
got
i
wouldn
t
let
them
do
that
ye
were
always
lacking
in
a
pinch
but
my
own
quinlevin
shrugged
i
can
see
yer
scruples
a
brother
s
a
brother
even
if
he
does
wean
away
yer
wife
harry
started
up
his
face
livid
at
the
cool
insulting
tones
and
ye
can
t
blame
moira
continued
quinlevin
coolly
if
he
s
turned
out
a
better
man
than
yerself
his
fiery
eyes
burned
in
his
pale
face
and
challenged
the
other
him
until
the
hot
words
on
harry
s
tongue
died
unuttered
a
fine
mess
and
he
s
no
frolicsome
brother
of
yours
how
much
does
he
know
of
the
de
vautrin
affair
enough
muttered
harry
sullenly
from
the
letters
and
what
you
told
him
in
the
he
can
t
go
he
broke
off
and
then
with
a
quick
change
into
eager
inquiry
he
d
hardly
have
had
time
to
find
the
duc
and
if
he
no
said
harry
sullenly
de
vautrin
is
in
nice
good
then
we
ll
have
time
for
what
to
meet
the
situation
as
it
should
be
met
i
intend
to
take
a
hand
in
this
affair
myself
what
can
you
do
i
ll
find
a
way
there
s
one
thing
sure
i
don
t
intend
to
have
the
ingenious
plans
of
half
a
lifetime
spoiled
by
any
blundering
from
kansas
city
he
s
not
my
brother
i
won
t
have
your
scruples
and
if
moira
has
learned
to
be
fond
of
him
so
much
the
worse
for
her
i
asked
her
to
marry
you
because
i
didn
t
want
any
strange
young
man
to
come
poking
about
my
affairs
or
hers
she
s
a
good
good
for
the
likes
of
either
of
us
she
was
never
much
after
the
men
being
wedded
to
her
art
and
i
thought
you
d
do
as
well
as
ye
d
make
good
over
here
and
turn
out
the
husband
she
deserved
he
paused
to
give
his
words
more
weight
instead
of
making
ve
made
a
mess
of
say
nothing
of
falling
short
with
moira
i
might
have
known
but
it
s
too
late
now
for
me
to
be
crying
over
my
spilt
milk
or
yours
and
whatever
happens
i
d
like
ye
to
know
my
boy
that
this
affair
means
too
be
balked
for
a
mere
sentiment
if
she
doesn
t
love
you
that
s
yer
own
affair
and
as
for
yer
brother
i
say
is
let
him
look
out
for
himself
he
had
sunk
into
his
chair
again
his
lips
compressed
his
eyes
closed
to
narrow
slits
and
his
voice
husky
a
moment
ago
with
his
passion
enunciating
his
words
with
icy
precision
but
how
are
you
going
to
find
him
haven
t
i
told
you
that
he
s
slipped
in
paris
and
you
know
what
that
means
how
could
he
slip
being
knocked
out
and
unconscious
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
his
white
fist
clenched
on
the
table
somebody
helped
it
s
not
possible
why
not
how
do
ye
know
ye
were
all
so
frightened
of
the
police
that
ye
took
to
yer
heels
without
a
look
around
but
nobody
but
pochard
s
crowd
knew
about
the
old
passage
to
the
then
somebody
in
pochard
s
crowd
did
the
helping
it
can
t
be
they
re
all
in
on
it
quinlevin
shrugged
perhaps
but
i
ll
be
looking
into
that
phase
of
the
question
myself
go
ahead
i
wish
you
luck
but
how
is
that
going
to
help
it
ll
find
jim
horton
and
that
s
the
only
matter
i
m
concerned
about
there
was
a
pause
and
another
voice
broke
the
silence
and
when
you
find
him
what
will
you
do
about
it
in
her
place
of
concealment
moira
trembled
at
the
sound
for
there
was
a
harsh
scraping
of
chairs
as
harry
and
quinlevin
rose
startled
and
faced
jim
horton
who
had
opened
the
door
of
the
closet
and
stood
revealed
before
them
harry
horton
drew
back
a
pace
leaning
on
a
chair
his
face
gray
then
purple
again
quinlevin
stared
one
eye
squinting
his
face
distorted
in
surprise
and
curiosity
at
the
astonishing
apparition
so
he
said
the
skeleton
in
the
closet
you
ll
find
me
far
from
that
said
jim
horton
striding
forward
to
within
a
few
paces
of
them
you
thought
i
might
be
hard
to
find
i
ll
save
you
that
trouble
i
see
said
the
irishman
finding
his
composure
and
a
smile
so
ye
re
the
comic
tragedian
of
the
piece
all
primed
and
set
for
trouble
well
i
can
t
say
that
ye
ll
be
he
reached
deliberately
for
his
trousers
pocket
and
drew
out
a
weapon
but
jim
leaped
for
him
at
the
same
time
that
moira
rushing
into
the
room
shrieked
quinlevin
s
name
the
sound
disconcerted
him
and
the
shot
went
wild
and
before
he
could
shoot
again
jim
horton
had
caught
his
arm
and
given
his
wrist
a
vicious
twist
which
wrenched
the
weapon
away
and
sent
him
hurling
into
a
chair
harry
horton
hadn
t
moved
his
feet
seemed
riveted
to
the
floor
father
moira
gasped
her
face
white
as
paper
you
might
have
killed
him
that
was
the
exact
intention
said
quinlevin
making
a
wry
face
and
nursing
his
wrist
but
jim
horton
frowning
at
the
two
men
held
the
weapon
in
his
hand
in
command
of
the
situation
why
did
you
come
out
moira
pleaded
wringing
her
fingers
and
staring
from
one
to
the
other
but
jim
horton
didn
t
even
hear
her
his
gaze
was
fixed
steadily
on
barry
quinlevin
who
had
shrugged
himself
back
into
and
was
smiling
up
at
the
intruder
as
though
in
appreciation
of
an
admirable
joke
we
d
better
have
this
thing
and
i
said
jim
coolly
eliminating
harry
from
the
discussion
by
all
means
said
quinlevin
and
i
m
glad
ye
know
a
real
enemy
when
ye
see
one
you
ve
hardly
left
any
doubt
about
that
there
s
not
much
to
say
except
that
you
re
not
going
to
drag
moira
into
this
dirty
business
with
the
duc
do
i
make
myself
clear
ye
ll
hardly
be
less
perspicuous
if
the
muzzle
of
the
revolver
is
twisted
a
bit
to
one
side
it
s
a
hair
as
you
were
i
won
t
waste
words
i
gave
harry
his
warning
instead
of
heeding
it
he
hired
a
pair
of
thugs
to
put
me
out
of
business
but
i
ll
take
no
chances
for
the
future
i
m
in
no
mood
to
die
just
yet
i
like
yer
nerve
jim
horton
i
may
add
it
suffers
no
disadvantage
in
comparison
to
yer
twin
brother
he
shrugged
and
folded
his
arms
well
ye
seem
to
have
turned
the
odd
ace
of
ace
of
hearts
now
what
are
ye
going
to
be
doing
with
us
all
entirely
i
told
harry
what
i
d
do
and
i
ll
repeat
it
now
drop
this
affair
of
the
duc
de
dragging
moira
through
the
dirty
mess
and
i
harry
with
his
rank
and
honors
and
if
i
jim
horton
shrugged
carelessly
i
ll
tell
the
s
all
brevity
is
the
soul
of
wit
permit
me
to
say
that
i
admire
the
succinctness
of
yer
statement
but
the
alternative
is
impossible
you
mean
that
you
ll
go
on
with
this
ye
ve
guessed
it
me
sure
as
ever
ye
find
it
convenient
to
remove
the
imminent
and
deadly
weapon
and
yerself
from
my
presence
that
s
final
quinlevin
laughed
and
very
coolly
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
whisky
what
s
the
use
of
quarreling
by
a
bit
of
mistaken
heroics
ye
ve
fired
yerself
into
the
midst
of
my
little
family
circle
and
exploded
maybe
ye
ve
done
some
damage
but
i
m
an
old
bird
and
i
don
t
scare
so
easily
come
now
ye
wouldn
t
kill
me
out
of
hand
ye
re
not
that
kind
and
s
be
reasonable
can
i
pour
ye
a
drink
no
as
ye
please
but
ye
ve
got
to
admit
that
there
are
two
sides
to
this
question
if
the
information
in
my
possession
is
correct
d
ye
see
ye
re
a
deserter
from
the
army
of
the
united
states
a
word
to
the
nearest
private
of
the
military
police
and
ye
re
jugged
to
do
yer
explaining
to
a
judge
advocate
you
can
won
t
do
that
moira
seemed
to
find
her
speech
with
an
effort
for
the
rapidity
of
events
and
their
portentous
consequences
to
her
own
destiny
had
robbed
her
of
all
initiative
but
her
courage
came
back
with
a
rush
as
she
faced
this
man
who
had
deceived
her
all
these
charmed
her
even
now
with
his
reckless
grace
and
magnetism
you
won
t
do
that
she
went
on
breathlessly
i
can
t
permit
it
i
ve
heard
all
you
said
i
ve
been
ah
you
heard
said
quinlevin
with
a
quick
glance
at
her
then
perhaps
it
s
just
as
well
i
would
be
having
to
tell
you
some
day
and
then
with
quick
decision
ye
re
not
my
daughter
ye
re
the
child
of
the
duc
de
vautrin
as
he
shot
this
bolt
at
her
he
watched
its
effect
moira
grew
even
paler
and
stared
at
him
as
though
he
were
a
person
she
had
never
seen
before
the
the
duc
de
vautrin
she
stammered
that
s
not
true
moira
broke
in
jim
s
voice
but
you
re
not
daughter
either
i
ll
take
my
oath
on
it
she
glanced
at
jim
as
though
the
deep
tones
of
his
voice
had
steadied
her
for
a
moment
not
his
she
paused
and
sought
quinlevin
s
eyes
uncertainly
i
ve
told
ye
the
truth
my
dear
it
was
my
crime
not
to
have
told
ye
that
s
all
ye
can
lay
against
and
the
love
for
ye
that
has
made
the
confession
difficult
moira
faltered
but
barry
quinlevin
s
eyes
were
upon
her
alive
it
seemed
with
the
old
affection
and
across
her
brain
flitted
quick
visions
of
their
careless
past
their
years
of
plenty
their
years
of
privation
in
which
this
man
her
father
she
had
thought
had
always
loomed
the
dominant
figure
reckless
perhaps
aloof
at
always
but
there
was
jim
horton
just
beside
her
she
felt
his
presence
strength
of
honesty
and
the
love
of
her
that
gave
him
the
courage
to
face
oblivion
for
her
sake
the
silence
was
deathly
and
seemed
to
have
gone
on
for
hours
jim
did
not
speak
there
was
harry
too
standing
like
a
pale
image
the
ghost
of
her
at
her
were
they
all
dumb
something
seemed
to
be
required
of
her
and
her
instinct
answered
for
her
she
moved
toward
jim
horton
her
fingers
seeking
his
love
him
she
found
herself
saying
you
both
to
know
it
has
all
been
a
horrible
it
s
too
late
to
cry
over
it
has
just
s
all
i
can
never
love
any
one
whispered
jim
but
i
know
there
s
nothing
to
be
done
i
only
wanted
you
to
know
she
finished
firmly
that
any
one
who
harms
him
harms
moira
jim
s
voice
broke
in
pleadingly
at
her
ear
come
away
with
you
can
t
stay
here
the
situation
is
impossible
she
felt
barry
quinlevin
s
eyes
before
he
spoke
i
don
t
need
to
remind
ye
yer
vows
at
the
what
vows
broke
in
jim
fiercely
facing
his
brother
a
cruel
hoax
there
s
no
law
that
will
keep
it
she
married
her
eyes
open
muttered
harry
and
unless
i
release
stop
for
god
s
sake
moira
s
voice
found
itself
in
pity
for
her
own
humiliation
there
s
no
hope
for
either
of
us
there
s
no
i
ask
nothing
of
you
moira
jim
was
pleading
again
only
to
go
with
from
your
own
an
sneered
quinlevin
he
saw
how
the
game
was
going
but
he
went
too
far
she
turned
on
him
defiantly
an
outcast
she
said
i
would
be
proud
to
be
facing
the
world
alone
with
such
an
outcast
as
jim
shame
and
the
glory
of
following
blindly
where
my
heart
was
leading
come
then
said
jim
no
don
t
you
see
i
can
t
what
harry
says
is
true
i
married
with
my
eyes
open
i
swore
to
a
lie
and
i
ve
got
to
abide
by
that
lie
i
ve
got
to
jim
for
god
s
sake
have
pity
she
sank
helplessly
into
a
chair
relinquishing
his
hand
all
hope
all
life
it
seemed
had
gone
out
of
her
jim
horton
stood
regarding
her
for
a
moment
and
then
silently
walked
to
the
door
when
he
heard
her
voice
again
jim
she
cried
despairingly
he
turned
in
the
doorway
and
their
glances
met
for
a
moment
will
you
come
moira
he
asked
quietly
i
can
t
jim
i
can
he
waited
a
moment
and
then
laying
quinlevin
s
weapon
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
turned
again
and
walked
out
of
the
door
and
into
the
darkness
of
the
corridor
a
it
would
have
been
easy
for
quinlevin
to
have
shot
him
in
the
back
and
at
the
moment
jim
horton
wouldn
t
much
have
cared
if
he
had
he
went
down
the
stairs
slowly
across
the
court
and
out
into
the
street
wandering
aimlessly
bare
headed
with
no
sense
of
any
intention
or
direction
there
s
no
death
moira
s
words
rang
again
and
again
in
his
brain
that
was
a
part
of
her
creed
her
faith
her
religion
she
had
once
spoken
of
what
her
church
had
always
meant
to
mother
she
had
called
it
she
was
true
to
her
convictions
there
s
no
death
the
revelation
of
her
beliefs
was
not
new
to
him
yet
it
came
to
him
with
a
sense
of
shock
that
she
had
chosen
at
the
last
to
remain
with
harry
and
quinlevin
and
all
the
degradation
that
the
association
meant
to
her
it
had
been
a
choice
between
two
degradations
and
force
of
habit
had
cast
the
last
feather
into
the
balance
in
the
bitterness
of
his
own
outcast
with
no
hope
of
regeneration
he
tried
to
find
it
in
his
heart
to
blame
her
but
the
thought
of
the
pain
and
bewilderment
he
had
seen
in
her
eyes
made
him
only
pitiful
for
her
misfortunes
it
seemed
as
though
the
shock
of
the
many
revelations
of
the
evening
had
deadened
her
initiative
enfeebled
her
fine
impulses
and
made
her
like
a
dependent
the
mercy
of
custom
and
tradition
and
he
could
not
forget
that
he
had
gone
to
her
asking
nothing
expecting
nothing
and
that
in
spite
of
all
the
barriers
that
she
recognized
between
them
in
spite
of
the
deception
he
had
practiced
she
had
still
clung
to
him
and
even
acknowledged
him
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
and
the
man
she
called
her
father
love
had
glowed
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
heart
lifting
her
for
a
time
above
the
tragic
mystery
of
her
origin
and
the
broken
ideals
of
a
lifetime
it
was
almost
enough
for
him
to
ask
of
her
it
didn
t
seem
to
matter
much
now
what
happened
to
him
but
almost
unconsciously
he
found
himself
casting
an
occasional
glance
over
his
shoulder
to
see
if
he
was
followed
he
had
no
fear
of
harry
his
brother
had
shown
in
his
true
colors
but
the
picturesque
scoundrel
whose
name
moira
bore
was
clearly
a
person
to
be
reckoned
with
why
quinlevin
hadn
t
taken
a
at
him
on
the
stairs
was
more
than
jim
horton
could
understand
unless
some
consideration
for
moira
had
held
his
hand
the
impulse
of
fury
that
had
made
him
draw
his
revolver
had
faded
but
their
controversy
was
still
unsettled
and
jim
horton
knew
that
the
one
duty
left
him
must
be
done
at
once
after
he
had
told
what
he
knew
to
de
vautrin
quinlevin
could
try
to
kill
him
if
he
not
before
would
the
memories
of
the
past
prevail
in
moira
s
relations
with
quinlevin
would
he
be
able
to
convince
her
that
she
was
the
duc
s
daughter
he
remembered
that
most
of
what
he
had
heard
from
his
place
of
concealment
could
be
susceptible
of
a
double
interpretation
under
the
skillful
manipulation
of
the
resourceful
irishman
jim
horton
knew
that
piquette
had
told
him
the
straight
story
from
harry
s
own
lips
but
he
could
not
violate
her
confidence
by
using
her
name
it
meant
danger
for
piquette
from
quinlevin
and
perhaps
a
revelation
of
her
breech
of
pochard
s
confidence
and
a
greater
danger
even
from
tricot
he
knew
that
he
must
move
alone
and
reach
the
ear
of
de
vautrin
at
once
with
his
testimony
he
approached
the
caf√©
of
leon
javet
when
he
heard
the
light
patter
of
feet
behind
him
and
stopped
and
turned
it
was
piquette
divested
of
her
fine
raiment
and
dressed
in
the
simple
garb
of
a
she
said
i
ave
been
waiting
for
oh
you
mus
not
go
in
javet
to
de
oder
side
of
de
why
piquette
he
asked
curiously
because
tricot
and
are
looking
for
you
and
dey
will
watch
javet
s
who
told
you
this
but
he
let
her
take
him
by
the
elbow
to
the
darkness
opposite
pochard
de
house
in
de
rue
charron
is
watch
by
de
police
dey
are
afraid
you
will
give
de
they
needn
t
worry
just
now
he
muttered
i
ve
something
else
to
do
but
you
mus
keep
away
from
de
i
expect
to
i
m
going
away
jeem
where
to
nice
i
ve
got
to
see
your
friend
de
vautrin
at
once
vautrin
she
walked
along
with
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
where
is
your
at
he
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
aware
for
the
first
time
of
his
loss
i
left
in
the
rue
de
tavennes
yes
ah
you
mus
tell
me
come
to
de
boulevard
clichy
it
is
safer
i
ve
taken
a
lodging
in
the
rue
jean
paul
no
she
insisted
you
mus
take
no
more
chances
on
dis
side
of
de
river
jus
mus
i
you
mean
that
they
not
dey
will
if
dey
see
and
you
can
t
run
that
chance
piquette
we
are
quite
safe
in
de
boulevard
clichy
come
and
so
he
yielded
to
her
persuasions
and
followed
her
by
a
roundabout
way
across
the
pont
carrousel
and
so
toward
their
destination
while
he
told
her
in
general
terms
of
the
events
of
the
evening
she
listened
putting
in
an
exclamation
or
a
brief
question
here
and
there
but
made
no
comments
until
they
reached
her
apartment
where
she
made
him
comfortable
in
her
best
chair
gave
him
a
cigarette
and
getting
out
of
her
street
dress
slipped
into
her
dressing
gown
to
the
western
mind
unused
to
the
casual
ways
of
the
this
informality
might
have
seemed
indecorous
but
jim
horton
was
deeply
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
and
for
the
moment
did
not
think
of
her
and
when
she
drew
her
robe
around
her
and
took
up
a
cigarette
she
seemed
for
the
first
time
to
be
aware
of
his
abstraction
to
piquette
s
mind
those
things
which
were
natural
to
her
must
be
natural
to
every
one
else
and
this
after
all
is
only
the
simple
philosophy
of
the
child
as
she
curled
herself
up
on
her
and
lighted
her
cigarette
he
smiled
at
her
well
she
said
what
you
t
ink
of
monsieur
quinlevin
she
pronounced
it
canl
van
he
s
just
about
the
smoothest
proposition
that
ever
happened
he
replied
he
d
have
gotten
me
if
i
hadn
t
moved
in
close
an
e
did
not
ing
no
just
stood
there
he
s
lost
his
nerve
again
he
won
t
bother
me
but
the
irishman
is
in
this
game
for
keeps
he
is
dangerous
you
ad
better
not
go
on
wit
dis
affair
yes
piquette
i
must
he
said
quietly
i
got
into
this
situation
by
being
a
moral
coward
i
m
not
going
to
get
out
of
it
by
being
a
physical
one
besides
i
ve
promised
who
myself
it
s
a
duty
i
he
paused
to
madame
orton
an
what
t
anks
do
you
get
she
shrugged
expressively
a
bullet
or
a
knife
in
de
ribs
perhaps
you
ave
already
almos
enough
been
shot
and
beaten
and
yet
here
i
am
quite
comfortable
in
your
best
chair
and
none
the
to
you
piquette
but
you
can
not
always
be
so
lucky
i
would
be
ver
onhappy
if
you
were
kill
jeem
would
you
piquette
he
said
taking
her
hand
impulsively
and
kissing
it
gently
an
den
it
is
too
late
to
be
she
sighed
and
put
her
other
hand
over
his
oh
jeem
life
is
so
short
so
sweet
it
is
not
right
to
take
a
chance
of
dying
before
one
s
time
i
don
t
want
to
die
just
yet
and
i
don
t
expect
to
but
life
doesn
t
mean
a
whole
lot
to
me
it
s
too
complex
you
understand
he
gave
a
sigh
and
sank
back
in
his
chair
relinquishing
her
fingers
i
guess
i
was
meant
for
the
simple
life
he
said
with
his
slow
smile
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
regarding
him
soberly
what
as
happen
she
as
let
you
go
he
paused
frowning
at
the
ash
of
his
cigarette
what
else
could
she
do
he
asked
quietly
i
asked
nothing
of
her
then
you
can
not
be
disappoint
said
piquette
dryly
she
is
not
worth
de
trouble
you
run
a
risk
of
being
kill
to
save
er
from
er
usban
who
is
a
you
offer
er
de
bes
you
ave
an
she
send
you
away
alone
into
de
darkness
you
t

she
loves
you
what
she
knows
of

if
i
love
a
man
i
would
go
wit
im
to
de
end
of
de
worl
no
matter
what
e
is
he
sat
watching
her
as
she
to
the
clear
tones
of
her
voice
watching
the
changes
in
her
expressive
features
i
believe
you
would
piquette
he
muttered
an
you
she
went
on
shrilly
you
who

you
who

broke
in

a
she
paused
and
then
went
on
why
as
she
marry
your
broder
if
she
does
not
love
im
la
la
she
stopped
and
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
perhaps
you
onderstan
now
jeem
why
i
ave
not
marry
not
onless
i
love
and
her
voice
sank
to
a
tense
whisper
and
den
ontil
deat
i
would
be
yes
piquette
you
are
that
sort
but
and
he
glanced
about
the
room
she
shrugged
as
she
caught
his
meaning
monsieur
as
much
money
why
should
i
not
be
content
as
well
as
some
one
else
deep
in
his
heart
he
was
sorry
for
her
but
he
could
see
that
she
was
not
in
the
least
sorry
for
herself
and
the
unconventionality
of
her
views
the
total
lack
of
moral
sense
seemed
somehow
less
important
than
the
rugged
sincerity
of
her
point
of
view
and
the
steadfastness
of
her
friendship
and
you
have
never
loved
well
enough
to
marry
he
asked
no
jeem
she
said
gently
their
glances
met
his
level
and
friendly
and
it
was
her
look
that
first
turned
away
no
jeem
she
repeated
slowly
one
does
not
meet
such
a
man
ontil
it
is
too
late
she
gave
a
sharp
little
gasp
and
sat
up
facing
him
an
i
speak
of
my
troubles
when
you
ave
greater
ones
of
your
own
i
want
to
elp
you
you
ave
in
your
mind
a
duty
to
do
with
monsieur
the
duc
de
vautrin
you
ave
make
me
t
ink
perhaps
it
is
my
duty
too
i
ve
got
to
see
him
at
once
before
quinlevin
does
he
is
on
the
we
s
all
find
im
we
perhaps
i
can
make
it
easier
for
you
to
see
you
ll
go
with
me
why
not
onless
you
do
not
want
of
course
i
ll
be
only
too
happy
what
it
seems
a
great
deal
to
ask
you
ve
already
done
so
much
no
she
said
with
a
smile
it
will
perhaps
be
safer
for
both
of
us
away
from
paris
an
you
are
onhappy
will
i
perhaps
not
cheer
you
up
a
little
there
s
no
doubt
of
that
i
would
like
to
go
wit
you
it
will
give
me
you
do
not
mind
but
monsieur
the
ne
me
fiche
besides
shall
i
not
now
be
doing
him
a
service
yes
that
s
true
he
stopped
as
a
thought
came
to
him
the
duc
suspects
something
what
made
him
go
to
ireland
and
question
nora
burke
perhaps
i
talk
a
little
too
much
dat
has
he
spoken
of
it
since
yes
but
i
tol
im
not
ing
i
did
not
wish
to
get
arry
in
trouble
but
she
shrugged
and
lighted
a
fresh
cigarette
i
do
not
care
about
what
appen
to
arry
or
monsieur
quinlevin
it
is
only
what
appens
to
you
dat
matters
jeem
but
in
befriending
me
you
ve
made
enemies
of
all
that
not
onless
dey
find
out
it
is
you
who
are
in
danger
after
what
you
ave
eard
you
are
more
dangerous
to
quinlevin
dan
ever
i
gave
him
his
chance
he
didn
t
take
it
but
he
ll
make
anoder
chance
you
do
not
know
dat
man
even
tricot
is
afraid
of
im
well
i
m
not
he
thinks
the
world
owes
him
a
living
but
he
wouldn
t
last
half
an
hour
out
in
the
country
where
i
come
from
he
s
clever
enough
to
put
it
over
moira
all
these
yes
jeem
an
e
may
put
it
over
dat
you
go
from
perhaps
he
muttered
with
a
frown
but
that
doesn
t
matter
she
s
not
de
vautrin
s
d
take
an
oath
on
it
i
ve
got
to
clear
her
skirts
of
this
dirty
mess
she
wouldn
t
come
they
ve
got
her
there
prisoner
she
can
t
help
herself
i
can
t
be
losing
any
time
he
rose
suddenly
as
though
aware
of
the
passage
of
time
and
took
a
few
paces
away
from
her
not
said
piquette
the
first
train
i
ve
got
to
go
and
find
out
she
glanced
at
the
small
enameled
clock
upon
the
mantel
it
is
too
late
dere
would
be
no
fas
express
until
de
morning
very
well
i
ll
see
and
he
strode
toward
the
door
at
de
hotel
de
corner
you
will
find
out
but
she
had
sprung
up
and
running
out
of
the
apartment
returned
in
a
moment
with
a
soft
hat
which
she
gave
him
thanks
re
my
good
angel
i
do
seem
to
need
you
don
t
i
i
ope
you
do
she
said
quietly
and
then
go
an
urry
back
i
will
wait
for
you
thus
it
was
that
the
next
day
found
jim
horton
and
piquette
together
in
a
compartment
of
the
marseilles
express
on
their
way
to
the
riviera
jim
had
managed
to
get
reservations
in
a
train
which
was
now
running
regularly
and
then
after
advising
piquette
had
returned
to
his
lodgings
in
the
rue
jean
paul
meeting
her
at
the
gare
de
lyon
at
noon
piquette
seemed
to
have
thought
of
everything
that
he
had
forgotten
and
greeted
him
with
an
air
of
gayety
which
did
much
to
restore
his
drooping
spirits
it
was
very
cozy
very
comfortable
in
their
compartment
and
piquette
looked
upon
the
excursion
from
the
angle
of
the
child
ready
and
willing
to
take
a
new
pleasure
in
anything
curiously
enough
she
had
traveled
once
to
the
c√¥te
d
azur
and
looked
forward
with
delight
to
the
southern
sunshine
the
blue
of
the
sea
and
the
glimpse
of
the
world
of
fashion
which
was
once
more
to
be
seen
upon
the
des
the
passing
landscape
she
greeted
with
little
childish
cries
as
she
recognized
familiar
upper
reaches
of
the
seine
juvisy
then
arpajon
etampes
and
orleans
and
jim
horton
sat
watching
her
detached
by
her
magnetism
from
the
gloom
of
his
thoughts
aware
of
the
quality
of
her
devotion
to
this
newly
found
friend
for
whom
with
joyous
carelessness
she
was
risking
the
of
her
the
displeasure
of
her
bloodthirsty
friends
of
earlier
days
and
even
perhaps
her
very
life
she
was
a
new
event
in
his
experience
giving
him
a
different
meaning
for
many
things
there
had
been
no
new
passages
of
anything
approaching
sentiment
between
them
and
he
watched
her
curiously
it
seemed
that
what
she
wished
him
to
understand
was
that
she
was
merely
a
good
friend
that
he
could
tie
to
and
be
understood
by
even
when
he
took
her
hand
in
natural
impulse
on
jim
s
part
when
it
lay
for
a
moment
beside
only
let
it
rest
there
a
moment
and
then
gave
a
careless
gesture
or
made
a
swift
useful
motion
which
dispelled
illusions
and
exorcised
sentiment
and
yet
of
sentiment
of
another
sort
she
was
full
fairly
bubbling
over
with
sympathy
and
encouragement
inviting
him
to
share
her
enjoyment
of
the
gray
and
brown
pastoral
from
the
car
window
peaceful
beautiful
and
untouched
by
the
rough
hand
of
war
it
was
a
kind
of
friendship
he
couldn
t
understand
and
wouldn
t
have
understood
perhaps
even
if
he
had
been
skilled
in
the
knowledge
of
women
and
yet
there
it
was
very
real
very
vital
to
him
in
all
its
beauty
and
whatever
her
past
her
strange
philosophy
of
life
her
unique
code
of
morals
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
she
was
a
fine
young
animal
feminine
to
the
last
glossy
hair
of
her
head
and
compact
of
splendid
forces
which
had
been
virtues
which
refused
to
be
stifled
by
the
mere
accident
of
environment
but
most
of
all
was
she
that
product
of
the
latin
quarter
which
knows
and
shares
poverty
and
affluence
friendship
and
enmity
the
she
thought
nothing
of
her
exploit
in
rescuing
him
from
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
nor
would
she
permit
a
repetition
of
his
admiration
and
gratitude
the
impulse
that
had
driven
her
to
the
rescue
was
spontaneous
he
was
one
she
knew
an
american
soldier
a
friend
of
france
in
trouble
was
not
that
enough
as
the
day
wore
on
piquette
grew
tired
looking
at
the
scenery
and
after
yawning
once
or
twice
laid
her
head
quite
frankly
upon
his
shoulder
with
all
the
grace
of
a
tired
child
and
immediately
went
to
sleep
jim
horton
smiled
down
at
her
with
a
new
sense
of
pride
in
this
strange
friendship
admiring
the
fine
level
brows
the
shadows
on
her
slightly
tinted
with
blue
the
nose
the
scarlet
curve
of
her
under
lip
and
the
firm
line
of
her
jaw
and
chin
two
outcasts
they
were
he
and
she
strangely
met
and
more
strangely
linked
in
the
common
purpose
of
protecting
the
destinies
of
a
decadent
french
gentleman
whom
jim
horton
had
never
seen
and
in
whom
he
had
no
interest
and
what
was
her
motive
her
loyalty
to
de
vautrin
unlike
that
which
she
had
shown
for
him
was
spasmodic
actuated
by
no
affection
but
only
by
the
humor
of
the
moment
she
did
not
love
this
man
he
had
never
been
to
her
anything
more
than
a
convenience
he
smiled
the
word
suggested
a
thought
to
him
convenience
was
this
relation
of
piquette
to
her
patron
any
worse
than
those
marriages
of
the
ambitious
girls
of
his
own
country
without
love
often
without
hope
of
love
to
bring
themselves
up
in
the
world
piquette
at
least
was
the
and
with
herself
the
vows
at
the
altar
were
sacred
he
knew
how
sacred
now
he
had
not
dared
to
think
of
moira
and
he
knew
that
it
was
well
that
piquette
had
kept
his
thoughts
from
her
but
now
as
his
companion
slept
his
arm
around
her
slim
figure
he
began
to
think
of
moira
and
the
tragic
decision
that
he
had
given
her
to
make
she
had
chosen
to
remain
there
in
the
rue
de
tavennes
because
that
was
the
only
home
she
knew
and
in
the
agony
of
her
mind
she
felt
that
she
must
find
sanctuary
in
her
own
room
with
her
thoughts
and
her
prayers
and
the
love
she
bore
him
he
knew
was
not
a
mere
passing
fancy
born
of
their
strange
romance
but
a
living
flame
of
pure
passion
which
could
only
be
dimmed
by
her
duty
to
her
not
extinguished
piquette
stirred
slightly
in
her
sleep
and
spoke
his
name
jeem
she
muttered
and
then
settled
herself
more
comfortably
against
his
shoulder
jim
horton
did
not
move
for
fear
of
awakening
her
but
his
gaze
passed
over
her
relaxed
features
and
a
generous
wave
of
gratitude
swept
over
him
for
all
that
she
had
done
for
him
what
a
trump
she
was
what
a
loyal
little
soul
to
help
him
with
no
hope
of
reward
but
the
same
kind
of
loyalty
she
had
given
him
he
must
not
fail
her
if
there
were
only
some
way
in
which
he
could
help
her
to
happiness
in
sleep
she
was
so
confiding
thinking
of
all
that
he
owed
her
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
gently
on
the
brow
she
did
not
waken
and
jim
horton
raised
his
head
then
suddenly
as
if
in
response
to
an
impulse
looked
at
the
small
uncurtained
window
that
let
out
upon
the
corridor
of
the
carriage
there
two
dark
eyes
stared
at
him
as
though
fascinated
from
a
pallid
face
the
whiter
for
its
frame
of
dusky
face
of
moira
quinlevin
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
the
vision
was
a
part
of
his
obsession
and
for
a
second
did
not
then
started
forward
awakening
piquette
for
behind
the
face
in
the
obscurity
of
the
corridor
he
made
out
another
the
iridescent
eyes
of
barry
quinlevin
night
and
even
as
he
looked
the
faces
were
merged
into
the
obscurity
and
vanished
piquette
clung
to
his
arm
whispering
i
d
such
a
dreadful
why
jeem
what
is
it
he
started
to
his
feet
barry
he
gasped
with
her
clutch
on
his
arm
tightened
i
saw
them
you
dreamed
like
me
i
can
t
they
were
there
a
moment
ago
let
me
go
piquette
no
she
gasped
in
a
frightened
whisper
you
mus
not
i
ve
got
explain
he
muttered
but
she
only
clutched
his
arm
the
more
firmly
and
he
could
not
shake
her
off
for
she
held
him
with
the
strength
of
desperation
not
now
jeem
she
pleaded
am
frighten
he
glanced
at
her
quickly
and
it
seemed
as
if
this
were
so
for
her
face
had
gone
so
white
that
the
rouge
upon
her
lips
looked
like
the
blood
upon
an
open
wound
it
is
jus
what
e
want
jeem
for
you
to
go
after
him
what
do
you
mean
it
would
give
him
de
excuse

to
shoot
nonsense
he
knows
de
law
he
will

you
jeem
i
m
not

i
ve
got
to
go
no
you

leave

here
there

nothing
to
be
frightened
about
on
a
train
full
of
he
managed
to
reach
the
door
with
piquette
clinging
to
him
and
peered
out
into
the
corridor
a
guard
was
approaching
est
ce
monsieur
et
cette
he
stammered
ollendorf
fashion
and
then
his
french
failed
him
and
he
floundered
helplessly
pleading
with
piquette
to
finish
what
he
wished
to
say
but
the
man
understood
rattled
off
a
rapid
sentence
and
disappeared
it
is
dat
dey
have
gone
into
anoder
carriage
she
translated
you
see
it
will
be
impossible
to
find
dem
no
he
muttered
but
he
knew
that
the
delay
had
cost
him
his
opportunity
you
mus
not
leave
me
piquette
pleaded
at
his
ear
i
ave
fear
of

e
as
seen
us
together
now
e

that
it
is
i
who

laid
a
hand
over
hers
and
patted
it
reassuringly
don
t
worry
he
can
t
harm
you
i
am
not
afraid
when
you
are
ere
she
whispered
and
she
won
her
way
it
was
the
least
that
he
could
do
for
her
so
he
sat
again
thinking
of
the
look
in
moira
s
eyes
and
frowning
out
of
the
window
wondering
how
best
to
meet
this
situation
while
piquette
clung
to
his
arm
and
patted
his
hand
nervously
we
should
ave
watch
for
im
de
gare
de
lyon
i
don
on
erstan
nor
he
got
her
to
come
with
him
muttered
jim
fiercely
ave
i
not
tol
you
e
is
a
man
man
to
be
watch
be
fear
how
did
he
get
her
to
come
jim
repeated
as
though
to
himself
how
did
there
seemed
no
necessity
to
find
a
reply
to
that
for
there
she
was
in
the
next
carriage
perhaps
with
this
shrewd
rascal
whose
power
and
resource
seemed
hourly
to
grow
in
importance
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
moira
had
listened
to
quinlevin
had
believed
the
story
he
had
chosen
to
tell
her
directly
after
the
convincing
proof
of
his
villainy
directly
after
jim
horton
s
own
plea
to
save
her
what
witchcraft
had
he
employed
the
answer
came
in
a
shrewd
guess
of
piquette
s
dis
was
de
firs
fas
express
to
de
mediterranean
she
said
e
knew
you
would
go
to
monsieur
de
vautrin
las
night
e
foun
out
i
would
go
wit
you
but
who
she
shrugged
uneasily
he
turned
with
a
frown
and
examined
piquette
with
quick
suspicion
but
her
gaze
met
his
frankly
the
thought
that
had
sped
through
his
mind
was
discreditable
to
her
and
to
him
for
thinking
it
there
was
no
possibility
of
her
collusion
with
quinlevin
her
fear
of
him
was
too
genuine
he
arranged
things
nicely
to
show
her
with
it
is
dat
only
which
made
er
come
smooth
muttered
jim
and
she
saw
me
all
right
he
finished
bitterly
piquette
was
silent
for
awhile
she
is
ver
andsome
she
said
at
last
and
then
an
she
foun
me
asleep
wit
my
ead
on
your
shoulder
yes
muttered
jim
she
did
at
the
moment
he
could
not
think
how
much
his
words
wounded
her
i
am
sorry
she
said
gently
his
conscience
smote
him
at
the
tone
of
contrition
oh
it
doesn
t
matter
of
course
he
said
there
was
no
but
it
complicates
things
a
little
yes
i
comprehend
monsieur
hopes
to
keep
you
from
reaching
the
duc
he
won
t
i
d
rather
he
hadn
t
seen
me
in
the
train
or
madame
jim
horton
made
no
reply
and
was
at
once
enwrapped
in
his
thoughts
which
as
piquette
could
see
excluded
her
and
after
a
glance
at
his
face
she
too
was
silent
the
train
stopping
here
and
there
rushed
on
through
the
darkness
for
hours
it
seemed
to
piquette
and
her
companion
still
sat
staring
at
the
blank
wall
before
him
absorbed
in
his
problem
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
at
last
she
could
bear
the
silence
no
longer
jeem
you
love
er
so
much
as
dat
she
asked
he
started
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
then
turned
and
laid
his
hand
over
hers
i
m
a
fool
piquette
he
muttered
who
s
all
say
she
shrugged
then
she
turned
her
palm
up
and
clasped
his
i
am
ver
sorry
the
touch
of
her
hand
soothed
him
in
spite
of
the
danger
that
she
now
ran
only
half
suggested
by
what
she
had
said
she
could
still
find
words
to
comfort
him
selfish
brute
that
he
was
not
to
think
of
her
piquette
i
have
gotten
you
into
trouble
no
i
got
myself
into
it
jeem
he
made
no
sat
frowning
the
train
had
stopped
again
by
contrast
with
the
roar
to
which
their
ears
had
become
accustomed
the
silence
was
eloquent
as
though
their
train
had
stopped
breathless
upon
the
edge
of
an
abyss
then
small
sounds
emerged
from
the
silence
a
complaining
voice
from
an
adjoining
compartment
the
buzzing
of
an
insect
a
distant
hissing
of
steam
then
suddenly
the
night
was
split
with
a
crash
of
sound
and
glass
from
the
window
was
sprinkled
over
them
another
crash
and
before
piquette
had
realized
what
was
happening
jim
had
seized
her
bodily
and
thrown
her
to
the
floor
of
their
compartment
and
was
crouching
over
her
while
the
missiles
from
outside
fired
rapidly
were
buried
in
the
woodwork
above
the
place
where
they
had
sat
six
shots
and
then
a
commotion
of
voices
here
there
everywhere
and
the
sound
of
feet
running
inside
the
train
and
out
lucky
i
pulled
that
blind
said
jim
as
he
straightened
glancing
at
the
bullet
holes
quinlevin
gasped
piquette
as
she
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
jim
horton
got
up
and
opened
the
door
just
as
the
guards
came
running
with
excited
inquiries
and
seeing
piquette
upon
the
floor
madame
has
been
but
piquette
immediately
reassured
them
by
getting
up
frightened
but
quite
unhurt
by
the
shots
came
she
explained
quickly
in
french
while
jim
exhibited
the
damaged
paneling
some
one
outside
has
fired
at
they
understood
and
were
off
again
out
into
the
darkness
where
there
was
much
running
about
with
lanterns
and
many
cries
of
excitement
while
the
other
passengers
crowded
into
the
compartment
and
examined
the
bullet
holes
mouths
agape
is
it
the
boches
asked
an
excited
of
her
de
not
unlikely
replied
the
other
but
jim
horton
knew
better
consideration
for
moira
s
position
had
kept
him
silent
and
inactive
until
the
present
moment
but
he
was
angry
now
at
quinlevin
s
dastardly
attempt
at
the
murder
of
either
or
both
of
them
so
nearly
successful
and
so
when
the
officials
of
the
train
led
by
a
fussy
stout
individual
in
buttons
returned
to
question
him
he
answered
freely
his
replies
quickly
translated
by
piquette
describing
quinlevin
a
monsieur
with
a
mustache
and
echoed
the
stout
official
taking
notes
rapidly
on
a
pad
and
mademoiselle
had
dark
hair
and
blue
they
were
of
the
party
of
four
in
the
second
broke
in
the
guard
whom
jim
had
questioned
earlier
in
the
day
it
is
impossible
monsieur
they
left
the
train
at
st
etienne
a
party
of
four
questioned
piquette
astonished
the
two
you
mention
besides
another
man
and
an
older
woman
what
did
the
other
two
look
like
asked
jim
thinking
of
harry
the
old
woman
had
reddish
hair
streaked
with
man
was
small
with
a
hooked
nose
and
the
man
with
the
hooked
nose
did
he
leave
at
etienne
too
asked
jim
now
that
you
mention
said
the
guard
scratching
his
head
i
think
i
saw
him
a
while
ago
at
the
rear
of
the
train
jim
horton
scowled
find
the
man
with
the
hooked
nose
monsieur
he
muttered
but
the
fussy
official
was
now
shrugging
and
gesticulating
wildly
it
was
impossible
to
do
anything
more
it
was
like
hunting
for
a
needle
in
a
his
train
was
already
an
hour
late
the
search
would
be
taken
up
in
the
village
where
they
had
stopped
but
nothing
could
be
done
for
the
present
the
train
would
be
thoroughly
searched
and
then
they
must
go
on
in
the
meanwhile
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
monsieur
and
madame
to
change
to
a
vacant
compartment
jim
horton
protested
but
to
no
avail
and
after
another
wait
during
which
there
were
more
waving
of
lanterns
outside
and
more
shouts
the
train
went
on
upon
its
way
he
had
to
confess
himself
astonished
at
the
desperate
measures
his
enemies
had
taken
to
prevent
his
revelations
who
was
the
small
man
with
the
hooked
nose
it
wasn
t
harry
who
was
whose
nose
was
straight
but
when
they
were
seated
in
the
new
place
provided
for
them
a
thought
came
to
jim
and
when
the
guard
came
around
again
he
questioned
was
there
anything
especially
noticeable
about
the
small
man
with
the
hooked
nose
asked
jim
i
don
t
comprehend
m
sieu
did
you
notice
anything
curious
in
the
way
he
walked
for
instance
now
that
you
mention
it
i
think
he
walked
with
a
slight
limp
piquette
and
jim
exchanged
quick
glances
tricot
gasped
piquette
you
re
sure
he
is
nowhere
on
the
train
positive
m
sieu
we
have
searched
everywhere
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
some
security
therefore
that
jim
settled
himself
again
and
tried
to
make
piquette
comfortable
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
neither
of
them
felt
like
sleeping
now
and
they
talked
eagerly
of
the
extraordinary
happening
there
seemed
no
reason
to
doubt
that
their
assailant
was
tricot
and
that
the
clever
brain
of
quinlevin
had
planned
the
whole
affair
there
was
no
doubt
either
that
quinlevin
had
told
the
of
piquette
s
part
in
the
affair
of
the
rue
charron
and
that
the
shots
were
intended
as
much
for
piquette
as
for
him
this
was
the
danger
in
the
path
of
those
who
betrayed
the
secrets
of
the
underworld
but
piquette
having
recovered
from
her
fright
was
now
again
quite
composed
it
s
very
clear
why
monsieur
quinlevin
left
the
train
at
etienne
with
madame
he
was
afraid
she
would
make
trouble
yes
jeem
also
e
t
ought
tricot
would
have
success
she
caught
his
hand
and
held
it
a
moment
e
would
ave
kill
me
if
you
adn
push
me
on
de
floor
pretty
clever
sizing
us
up
like
that
then
letting
tricot
do
his
dirty
work
he
didn
t
think
i
d
see
him
but
we
know
what
we
re
up
against
now
and
they
ll
waste
no
time
in
following
i
ve
got
to
get
a
gun
somewhere
that
s
sure
and
you
ve
got
to
stop
at
marseilles

marseilles
he
nodded
i
m
not
going
to
let
you
run
your
head
any
further
into
this
noose
you
see
what
the
danger
but
piquette
only
smiled
i
knew
what
de
danger
was
when

offer

to
come

m
not
going
to
stay

over

force
of

added

you
running
any
more
risks
he
muttered
i
s
all
run
de
risk

jeem
he
smiled
at
her
gently
there
was
something
in
her
devotion
in
the
dusk
of
the
soft
illumination
from
above
the
shadows
at
her
eyes
and
lips
seemed
more
than
ever
wistful
and
pathetic
why
do
you
dare
all
this
for
me
piquette

not
tell

she
said
gently

he
broke
in
awkwardly

said
impulsively
like
that
i
d

happy
she
gently
disengaged
his
arm
from
about
her
waist
den

she
said
gently
it
is
what

he
touched
her
hand
with
his
lips
but
there
seemed
nothing
to
say
est
whispered
piquette
with
a
smile
i
t
ink

he
blurted
out
but
i
won

you
piquette
dat
is
as
it
mus
be
an
now
we
on
erstan
each
oder
i
am
ver
content
jim
horton
from
embarrassment
at
the
astonishing
confession
began
to
understand
its
motive
and
sat
silent
piquette
s
hand
in
his
aware
of
the
bond
of
sympathy
between
them
it
s
a
queer
world
piquette
he
said
at
last
with
a
dry
laugh
i
care
for
somebody
i
can
t
care
for
god
knows
i
ve
made
a
fine
mess
of
things
and
will
probably
go
on
making
a
mess
of
life
mine
you
and
i
might
have
hit
it
off
from
the
beginning
no
jeem
you
were
not
for
me
piquette
she
caught
his
hand
in
both
of
her
own
and
with
one
of
her
swift
transitions
from
the
womanly
to
the
she
pleaded
an
now
you
will
not
ide
me
away
in
marseilles
he
smiled
at
her
earnestness
and
it
wasn
t
in
his
heart
any
longer
to
refuse
her
no
piquette
you
shall
go
and
impulsively
with
the
innocence
that
was
a
part
of
her
charm
she
kissed
him
fair
upon
the
lips
ah
jeem
you
are
ver
good
to
me
but
at
marseilles
he
armed
himself
with
a
new
automatic
and
with
the
weapon
in
his
pocket
felt
a
reasonable
sense
of
security
at
least
until
they
reached
their
destination
piquette
was
resourceful
and
on
the
train
to
nice
found
the
answer
to
the
problem
that
neither
of
them
had
been
able
to
solve
de
ol
woman
wit
de
gray
hair
she
said
with
an
air
of
conviction
after
a
long
period
of
it
is
nora
burke
by
george
cried
jim
awakening
i
believe
you
re
right
piquette
nora
burke
and
he
s
bringing
her
along
to
clinch
the
nice
she
nodded
but
we
s
all
reach
monsieur
le
duc
firs
delays
awaited
them
when
they
reached
the
h√¥tel
negresco
piquette
was
provided
with
the
name
which
monsieur
the
duc
chose
to
use
when
traveling
upon
inquiry
of
the
polite
gentleman
who
presided
over
the
destinies
of
the
guests
of
this
newest
addition
to
the
luxuries
of
the
des
they
were
informed
that
monsieur
and
madame
thibaud
had
gone
upon
a
along
the
cornice
road
at
the
information
piquette
laughed
outright
and
the
polite
frenchman
frowned
is
there
anything
so
extraordinary
in
a
with
madame
he
asked
frigidly
monsieur
she
replied
and
laughed
again
but
jim
horton
understood
monsieur
the
duc
was
relieving
piquette
of
a
great
moral
responsibility
they
were
shown
adjoining
rooms
where
they
removed
the
traces
of
their
journey
and
then
met
for
dinner
when
they
held
a
consultation
as
to
their
future
plans
if
monsieur
the
duc
had
gone
on
a
he
might
be
back
that
night
or
he
might
be
away
for
a
week
they
found
that
monsieur
and
madame
had
taken
only
a
suitcase
and
the
chances
were
that
they
would
return
to
the
negresco
by
the
morrow
but
time
was
it
would
not
be
long
before
quinlevin
and
his
queerly
assorted
company
would
be
arriving
in
nice
ready
in
some
nefarious
way
to
interfere
with
their
plans
and
so
after
dinner
they
took
the
train
for
monte
carlo
hoping
that
de
vautrin
s
weakness
for
gaming
would
have
led
him
to
that
earthly
paradise
of
loveliness
and
iniquity
it
was
late
when
they
reached
there
but
piquette
had
made
no
mistake
for
they
found
their
man
at
the
tables
so
deeply
engrossed
that
he
did
not
notice
their
approach
or
even
look
up
when
piquette
ignoring
the
wonderfully
accoutered
lady
at
his
side
addressed
him
in
her
most
mellifluous
tone
jim
horton
took
him
in
with
a
quick
glance
of
man
still
in
his
fifties
about
the
age
of
barry
quinlevin
but
smaller
with
a
thin
nose
sharp
black
eyes
a
bald
head
and
a
dyed
mustache
waxed
to
long
points
and
the
hands
upon
the
green
baize
of
the
table
wore
large
rings
one
set
with
a
ruby
the
other
with
an
emerald
that
he
was
losing
some
money
was
indicated
by
the
pucker
of
his
bushy
eyebrows
and
the
nervous
tapping
of
his
jeweled
fingers
upon
the
cloth
it
was
not
until
piquette
had
spoken
his
christian
name
several
times
that
he
seemed
to
hear
and
then
looked
up
his
face
a
cloud
of
impatience
and
it
is
i
olivier
she
piquette
he
said
with
a
glance
at
his
companion
yes
monsieur
said
piquette
coolly
and
it
seems
that
i
ve
brought
you
luck
for
at
that
moment
a
pile
of
gold
and
bank
notes
was
swept
in
his
direction
he
said
confusedly
and
then
but
it
isn
t
possible
i
was
told
that
you
were
coming
i
can
t
see
you
or
this
monsieur
who
comes
with
you
go
away
if
you
please
his
attitude
was
uncompromising
his
announcement
bewildering
but
piquette
was
undismayed
the
red
monsieur
she
said
calmly
and
before
he
could
prevent
shoved
a
pile
of
the
gold
coins
upon
the
color
and
the
duc
aghast
at
her
impudence
sat
for
a
moment
scowling
at
his
pile
of
money
the
gambler
in
him
arrested
by
the
fascinating
click
of
the
little
ball
red
wins
announced
piquette
echoing
the
you
see
monsieur
it
will
be
wise
for
you
to
treat
me
with
more
politeness
and
as
he
still
sat
as
though
fascinated
by
the
turn
of
his
fortune
and
made
no
motion
to
prevent
her
she
put
all
the
money
she
had
won
for
him
on
the
black
black
won
and
piquette
laughed
gayly
while
the
woman
beside
de
vautrin
sat
in
silence
it
does
not
do
to
venture
here
with
strange
goddesses
she
glanced
rather
scornfully
at
the
duc
s
companion
and
straightened
again
madame
muttered
de
vautrin
the
wheel
runs
for
you
i
have
finished
said
piquette
firmly
it
is
enough
no
growled
the
duc
thrusting
his
winnings
again
upon
the
black
you
will
lose
said
piquette
calmly
watching
the
leaping
of
the
little
ball
he
that
she
had
won
for
him
he
tried
again
lost
more
then
turned
on
her
with
a
frown
he
began
she
silenced
i
did
not
come
to
interfere
with
your
games
but
if
madame
thibaud
will
permit
and
she
smiled
with
diabolical
irony
at
de
vautrin
s
i
would
like
to
have
a
word
with
you
at
once
i
will
not
listen
to
him
he
scowled
at
jim
i
know
what
it
s
all
about
i
don
t
wish
to
see
you
are
you
mad
no
then
what
do
you
mean
by
this
i
ve
come
to
save
you
from
a
great
financial
he
sputtered
what
are
you
doing
here
with
this
man
it
is
infamous
i
want
no
more
of
you
go
no
olivier

she
said
quietly

kindly
compose
yourself
and
tell
me
who
has
been
sending
you
lying
telegrams
friend
in
paris
ah
what
did
he
say
what
does
it

to
you
what
he
said
gasped
de
vautrin

in
love
with
this
monsieur

to
him
i
don
t
care
i
m
through
with
you
ah
no

olivier
said
piquette
smiling
calmly
not
until
i
m
through
with
you
and
then
soberly
don
t
be
a
fool
your
was
sent
by
monsieur
quinlevin
he
has
the
best
of
reasons
for
not
wanting
you
to
see
us
will
you
listen
to
me
now
quinlevin
s
name
had
startled
him
what
do
you
mean
he
sputtered
for
a
moment
after
jim
horton
s
departure
moira
sat
in
her
her
head
buried
in
her
arms
more
than
half
stupefied
one
horrible
revelation
had
followed
another
with
such
rapidity
that
she
was
aghast
at
the
complete
disruption
of
all
the
ties
that
had
made
her
life
and
this
last
strongest
and
the
weakest
of
too
had
been
broken
as
relentlessly
as
the
others
she
straightened
slowly
her
face
haggard
with
her
suffering
but
she
did
not
move
from
her
chair
and
her
fingers
clutched
its
arms
fiercely
her
eyes
staring
blankly
past
quinlevin
were
following
jim
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
rue
de
tavennes
but
her
fingers
still
clung
to
the
and
her
body
did
not
move
it
seemed
that
her
limbs
refused
to
obey
her
will
to
follow
then
after
a
moment
she
sank
down
again
crushed
bruised
and
nerveless
she
felt
the
touch
of
quinlevin
s
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
his
voice
whispering
at
her
ear
there
acushla
i
ll
be
explaining
it
all
to
you
in
the
morning
go
to
your
room
now
child
and
rest
she
obeyed
him
silently
mechanically
not
replying
or
looking
at
him
or
at
harry
her
throat
like
her
eyes
was
dry
and
parched
as
though
with
fever
but
her
hands
like
her
heart
were
ice
cold
in
the
sanctuary
of
her
own
room
with
the
doors
closed
she
threw
herself
headlong
upon
the
bed
racked
for
a
while
by
shuddering
soundless
then
after
a
while
merciful
tears
came
jim
she
whispered
hopelessly
into
the
darkness
jim
forgive
me
her
fingers
groped
for
her
crucifix
and
clung
to
it
seeking
strength
and
courage
and
after
a
long
while
the
spasm
of
weeping
stopped
and
she
lay
motionless
and
soundless
scarcely
breathing
she
knew
in
her
heart
that
what
she
had
done
was
best
for
jim
s
soul
s
good
and
her
own
but
her
heart
cried
out
against
the
cruelty
of
it
and
yet
she
was
sure
that
if
she
had
followed
him
beyond
the
studio
door
she
would
have
gone
out
with
him
into
the
world
glorying
in
her
shame
she
had
chosen
her
one
brief
gorgeous
pitiful
romance
was
over
and
what
was
there
left
for
her
here
at
the
studio
but
the
shattered
fragments
of
ruined
affections
she
had
lived
a
living
it
her
father
she
started
up
at
the
horror
that
she
had
forgotten
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
trying
to
collect
her
thoughts
then
she
rose
with
an
effort
groped
for
the
matches
and
lighted
her
candle
her
father
by
his
own
father
no
longer
who
was
she
then
a
waif
the
daughter
of
de
vautrin
her
mirror
sent
her
back
a
haggard
reflection
pale
somber
but
with
eyes
that
gazed
steadily
from
their
swollen
lids
strength
she
had
prayed
for
and
courage
to
do
what
was
right
to
do
and
she
needed
them
both
now
illustration
the
mirror
sent
her
back
a
haggard
reflection
pale
and
somber
there
was
no
sound
from
the
studio
she
glanced
at
her
clock
for
hours
it
seemed
she
had
lain
upon
her
bed
of
pain
with
a
new
resolution
she
bathed
her
face
and
wrists
in
cold
water
then
went
through
the
kitchenette
into
the
studio
to
find
barry
quinlevin
he
was
not
there
but
her
husband
was
in
the
armchair
by
the
table
and
the
whisky
bottle
was
empty
she
shuddered
a
little
but
approached
him
resolutely
he
tried
to
rise
but
with
a
dull
laugh
and
fumbling
the
arm
of
the
chair
fell
sideways
into
a
grotesque
attitude
where
she
began
and
halted
gone
out
he
mumbled
struggling
into
a
straighter
posture
back
soon
where
has
he
gone
he
shook
his
head
dunno
asked
me
to
care
of
you

she
turned
away
from
him
in
disgust
worry
he
went
not
goin

morr

she
turned
quickly
and
he
laughed
again

regimen

morr
she
whispered
a
thank
god
below
her
breath
as
she
stood
looking
at
him
and
then
aloud
gently
in
a
new
kind
of
pity
for
him
you

better

down

said

he

he
paused
a
moment
and
then
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
while
she
watched
him
curiously
rotten
mess
what
he
mumbled
she
didn
t
reply
and
he
went
on
concentrating
thought
with
difficulty
he
told

a
moment
and
swayed
but

but
god
what
a
head
it
won
t
do

to

she
put
in
quickly
for
he
was
shivering
as
though
with
a
chill
no
no
goo
now
awf
rotter
ain
t
i
he
stumbled
to
his
feet
and
she
helped
him
to
support
himself
will
you
forgive
me
moira
of
course
and
as
she
urged
him
out
of
the
door
toward
the
vacant
room
knew
y
would
he
mumbled
and
then
goo
ol
moira
in
the
room
she
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
puttees
and
shoes
and
then
pulling
a
blanket
over
him
left
him
to
his
own
devices
and
went
back
to
the
studio
to
wait
for
barry
quinlevin
but
she
wasn
t
weary
now
from
the
same
reserve
force
from
which
she
drew
the
strength
to
stand
for
hours
and
paint
even
when
her
sitters
were
weary
she
gained
new
courage
and
resolution
for
the
return
of
quinlevin
but
for
a
moment
she
was
tempted
again
the
way
was
clear
what
was
to
prevent
her
from
going
and
finding
jim
for
a
moment
only
then
she
sank
into
the
chair
by
the
fight
her
battle
with
herself
and
wait
her
glance
restlessly
passed
from
one
familiar
object
to
another
the
portrait
on
the
easel
the
lay
figure
in
the
corner
in
its
fantastic
pose
and
heterogeneous
costume
the
draperies
for
her
backgrounds
hanging
just
as
they
had
hung
this
afternoon
and
yet
all
so
strangely
changed
the
door
of
the
closet
where
jim
had
been
hidden
remained
open
exhibiting
its
untidy
interior
instinctively
she
rose
and
closed
it
her
sense
of
order
triumphant
even
over
her
mental
sufferings
then
she
went
back
and
sat
down
to
think
there
was
much
that
she
and
she
and
barry
quinlevin
would
have
to
say
to
each
other
he
came
at
last
expecting
to
find
harry
and
not
the
straight
figure
of
the
woman
who
faced
him
like
a
pale
fury
the
shadows
of
pain
at
her
eyes
were
gone
lost
in
deeper
shadows
of
anger
and
determination
you
moira
he
said
in
surprise
yes
where
s
harry
i
put
him
to
bed
he
was
drunk
she
said
shortly
the
devil
he
was
he
frowned
darkly
and
then
seemed
as
ever
quite
the
master
of
himself
if
the
glance
he
cast
at
her
discovered
her
state
of
mind
he
gave
no
sign
of
uneasiness
he
approached
her
with
his
easy
air
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
but
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
was
pitched
low
and
his
eyes
were
soft
i
thought
you
d
be
in
bed
i
ve
something
to
say
to
she
cut
in
quickly
oh
very
well
on
my
dear
you
don
t
mind
if
i
smoke
a
cigarette
as
she
made
no
reply
he
lighted
one
and
sank
into
the
most
comfortable
chair
with
a
sigh
of
content
at
least
you
owe
me
something
barry
quinlevin
she
began
tensely
trying
to
keep
her
voice
under
control
and
announcing
her
so
to
speak
in
her
first
phrase
i
m
no
chattel
of
yours
no
infant
any
longer
to
be
bandied
about

a
dupe
in

with
just
as

ve
dealt
with
my

had
any
cause
to
complain
of
my
treatment
of
ye
he
broke
in
calmly
you

cheated
to
me
all
my
t
that
enough
kept
me
in
ignorance
of
the
source
of
our
knows

to

hardly
he
said
it
was

own
money
i
don
t
believe

she
said
icily
if
it
was
my
money
you
would
have
gotten
it
for
of
ago
and
lost
yerself
my
dear
to
the
duc
de
vautrin
he
countered
quickly
she
started
slightly
that
possibility
hadn
t
occurred
to
her
but
she
went
on
rapidly
you
forget
that
i
heard
what
you
said
to
i
know
what
has
been
in
your
heart
all
these
years
i
was
your
decoy
and
you
used
me
as
you
pleased
glad
of
my
working
which
kept
me
busy
so
that
i
couldn
t
be
inquiring
what
was
going
on
you
forget
that
i
heard
why
you
wanted
me
to
marry
harry
but
can
t
forget
to
god
i
you
d
dare
to
ask
me
if
i
have
anything
to
complain
of
knowing
all
that
and
knowing
that
know
it
do
you
think
i
m
a
mere
piece
of
furniture
without
a
soul
not
to
care
what
my
heritage
is
not
to
cherish
my
you
ve
built
my
life
on
a
lie
destroyed
my
very
identity
in
a
breath
torn
down
all
the
sacred
idols
of
my
girlhood
and
young
womanhood
and
ground
them
under
your
feet
you
she
caught
at
her
heart
and
took
a
step
nearer
him
my
was
my
mother
she
gasped
he
shrugged
mary
duchesse
de
vautrin
he
said
easily
and
you

patricia
madeline
aulnoy
de
vautrin
impossible
i
m
no
longer
credulous
you
ll
have
to
believe
the
truth
and
who
are
you
to
ask
me
to
believe
you
who
dared
to
speak
to
me
of
the
sanctity
of
motherhood
who
taught
me
that
i
was
your
own
that
my
mother
your
she
broke
off
with
a
sob
quickly
controlled
it
was
because
i
loved
ye
moira
dear
he
said
very
quietly
she
halted
aghast
at
this
tenderness
the
familiar
tones
of
which
made
her
wonder
for
a
moment
whether
she
weren
t
dreaming
all
the
dreadful
accusations
on
her
tongue
s
end
but
a
pain
shot
through
her
heart
to
remind
her
of
her
sufferings
and
was
it
because
you
loved
me
that
you
dared
obliterate
me
sneered
at
my
pitiful
love
only
passion
i
ve
had
in
my
life
or
will
even
tried
to
murder
in
cold

quinlevin
the
irishman
s
manner
now
changed
his
brows

together
in
a
tight
knot
and
the
long
fingers
upon
the
clenched
until
the
knuckles
were
white
i
ll
answer
ye
that
he
said
abruptly
and
more
i
ve
heard
what
ye
had
to
say
with
patience
and
chagrin
i
ll
take
the
blame
for
me
sins
of
omission
where
blame
is
due
trusting
to
yer
conscience
to
be
forgiving
me
presently
for
yer
harsh
tones
to
one
who
sinned
for
the
very
love
of
ye
but
when
ye
speak
of
this
other
man
who
by
a
trick
forces
his
way
into
yer
lodgings
and
yer
affections
learns
yer
family
secrets
and
mine
reads
yer
letters
and
mine
makes
love
to
his
own
brother
s
wife
behind
his
back
own
mind
then
tells
one
lie
after
another
to
make
his
story
good
its
time
there
was
a
man
about
the
place
to
protect
ye
if
ye
can
t
protect
no
i
ve
heard
now
ye
ll
be
listening
to
me
if
harry
isn
t
man
enough
to
be
looking
out
fer
what
belongs
to
him
then
i
ye
ve
given
this
man
yer
heart
acknowledged
yer
affections
before
us
all
god
be
praised
that
s
all
it
amounts
to
but
when
ye
hear
me
out
ye
ll
be
wishing
yer
tongue
had
rotted
before
ye
d
made
such
an
admission
he
saw
her
shrink
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
following
up
his
advantage
quickly
my
dear
ye
ve
almost
had
enough
of
trouble
for
one
go
on
she
murmured
stanchly
but
if
you
re
going
to
speak
ill
of
jim
horton
i
won
t
believe
you
ye
can
do
as
ye
please
about
that
but
i
ll
be
telling
ye
what
i
know
of
him
just
the
same
and
when
i
tell
ye
i
wish
i
d
shot
him
dead
before
yer
eyes
i
d
only
be
satisfying
the
conscience
of
yer
guardian
and
conscience
she
laughed
hysterically
go
on
i
will
little
as
ye
ll
like
it
when
i
went
from
here
where
d
ye
suppose
i
went
to
pochard
and
i
wrung
from
him
the
truth
about
yer
friend
jim
horton
it
was
piquette
morin
who
helped
him
from
the
house
in
the
rue
i
know
it
i
thank
god
for
it
it
was
piquette
morin
who
took
him
back
to
her
apartment
in
the
boulevard
clichy
and
kept
him
there
until
he
recovered
i
know
that
too
go
but
ye
didn
t
know
that
piquette
morin
was
a
woman
without
a
shred
of
conscience
or
morals
a
woman
of
the
streets
who
glories
in
her
infidelities
to
the
duc
de
vautrin
whose
mistress
she
i
care
nothing
for
that
stammered
moira
ye
may
not
care
since
jim
horton
has
lied
about
that
too
but
ye
care
about
the
relations
that
exist
between
the
two
of
them
i
won
t
listen
said
moira
making
for
the
door
but
he
barred
her
way
oh
yes
ye
ll
listen
moira
dear
and
i
ll
be
giving
ye
all
the
proofs
ye
need
before
i
m
through
proofs
i
dare
you
all
in
good
time
if
ye
ll
be
patient
where
do
ye
think
i
went
from
pochard
s
to
the
boulevard
clichy
where
yer
precious
friend
had
returned
to
the
arms
of
madame
she
waved
a
hand
in
protest
i
watched
the
door
of
the
apartment
he
came
out
i
followed
and
where
do
you
suppose
he
went
to
the
ticket
office
where
he
booked
a
compartment
for
the
twelve
o
clock
train
for
marseilles
and
what
of
that
she
stammered
merely
that
yer
friend
jim
horton
failing
of
success
with
his
brother
s
wife
has
decided
upon
a
honeymoon
to
the
riviera
with
a
lady
who
is
more
than
yerself
i
don
t
believe
it
ye
d
find
it
less
difficult
to
believe
if
ye
guessed
how
mad
she
was
for
him
how
handsome
she
is
and
how
skilled
in
the
wily
arts
of
her
sex
and
trade
he
said
keenly
oh
he
said
with
a
shrug
it
could
only
have
been
a
great
passion
that
would
have
dared
the
rescue
from
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
and
no
man
remains
long
ungrateful
for
such
an
act
of
unselfishness
moira
leaned
against
the
staring
at
him
but
he
met
her
look
with
one
more
steady
than
hers
hardy
indignant
but
injured
and
grieved
too
at
her
attitude
skillfully
he
had
baited
his
hook
with
a
truth
that
she
knew
he
saw
the
fleeting
question
in
her
eyes
and
answered
it
quickly
if
ye
want
the
to
the
boulevard
clichy
now
he
paused
to
give
the
suggestion
weight
or
if
ye
ve
no
heart
for
such
a
brutal
the
train
to
marseilles
he
had
caught
her
ear
he
knew
it
by
the
sudden
shutting
of
her
teeth
over
her
words
the
proud
lift
of
her
chin
the
hard
look
that
came
into
her
eyes
and
though
she
answered
him
still
defiantly
her
tone
had
no
body
in
it
and
trembled
with
the
new
uncertainty
i
don
t
believe
you
i
don
t
ask
ye
to
but
ye
will
believe
in
the
evidence
of
yer
eyes
and
i
ll
be
providing
ye
with
that
my
dear
how
you
hate
him
she
gasped
he
shrugged
and
turned
half
toward
her
hate
hardly
i
merely
despise
him
i
would
have
killed
him
with
a
clean
conscience
knowing
what
i
do
he
dropped
the
cigarette
he
had
taken
up
and
approached
her
a
pace
or
two
oh
moira
alanah
won
t
ye
see
is
it
blind
ye
are
to
the
truth
that
lies
before
yer
very
can
t
ye
see
that
it
s
the
love
of
ye
that
drives
me
to
protect
yer
happiness
have
i
ever
failed
ye
all
these
years
haven
t
i
given
ye
yer
share
of
all
i
had
answer
me
when
there
was
not
too
much
for
the
both
of
us
ve
heard
she
said
wearily
i
m
sorry
ve
done
what
i
thought
was
the
best
i
m
still
yer
ye
come
into
yer
i
can
t
listen
to
that
she
shuddered
de
father
he
bowed
his
head
with
tragic
grace
the
cess
to
him
she
sank
into
a
chair
bewildered
and
helpless
i
want
to
go
away
somewhere
alone
i
ve
heard
enough
that
you
shall
do
presently
alanah
he
said
touching
her
gently
the
familiar
voice
close
at
her
ear
but
now
you
must
be
going
to
bed
and
trying
to
sleep
tis
a
cruel
day
ye
ve
but
when
ye
ve
had
some
she
raised
a
despairing
face
ye
ve
got
to
be
facing
it
but
no
more
come
she
let
him
take
her
by
the
arm
to
the
door
forgive
me
acushla
he
whispered
but
she
made
no
reply
and
left
him
standing
there
and
quinlevin
watched
her
merge
into
the
darkness
within
then
turned
and
picked
up
the
cigarette
he
had
dropped
lighted
it
with
great
care
and
sat
and
smoked
ruminating
over
the
ashes
in
the
fireplace
but
he
had
played
his
cards
with
the
true
gambler
s
knowledge
of
the
psychology
of
his
victim
jealousy
such
a
weapon
at
his
very
hand
it
was
almost
a
pity
to
use
it
poor
child
as
if
she
hadn
t
already
suffered
enough
but
there
was
no
choice
and
she
would
get
over
it
love
never
hate
only
hate
he
finished
one
cigarette
and
then
glanced
toward
the
door
through
which
moira
had
passed
then
lighted
another
and
composed
himself
for
awhile
longer
it
was
not
until
he
was
near
the
end
of
this
cigarette
that
a
slight
sound
caused
him
to
look
up
over
his
shoulder
framed
against
the
black
opening
moira
stood
pale
dark
eyed
her
black
hair
streaming
over
her
flimsy
and
then
came
forward
noiselessly
moira
he
cried
rising
with
an
air
of
surprise
you
must
show
me
the
she
stammered
what
you
yes
if
ye
i
do
it
s
a
the
you
i
ll
provide
it
ye
ll
leave
with
me
on
the
twelve
o
clock
train
for
marseilles
very
well
he
muttered
i
ll
arrange
for
it
i
ve
some
business
in
nice
it
s
just
as
well
if
you
come
along
she
whispered
shivering
and
still
protesting
but
i
don
t
don
t
go
to
bed
again
child
i
ll
call
ye
in
the
morning
as
she
disappeared
he
turned
toward
the
mantel
hiding
the
smile
of
triumph
that
crossed
his
lips
then
he
leaned
for
a
long
while
looking
into
the
hearth
poor
child
he
whispered
tis
a
cruel
pity
he
paused
and
then
turned
toward
the
bottle
upon
the
table
which
he
raised
and
examined
carefully
then
set
down
with
an
air
of
disgust
the
drunken
scut
he
muttered
then
swore
softly
below
his
breath
what
remained
of
quinlevin
s
task
was
not
difficult
for
he
had
already
anticipated
his
success
with
moira
by
making
arrangements
with
nora
burke
and
tricot
nora
to
face
de
vautrin
with
her
confession
and
her
evidence
tricot
to
help
him
in
keeping
jim
horton
from
reaching
the
duke
by
the
expression
of
moira
s
face
when
they
met
in
the
studio
in
the
morning
he
discovered
that
his
poison
had
worked
its
slow
course
through
her
veins
irish
she
irish
to
love
and
quick
to
to
the
quick
and
capable
of
a
fine
hatred
when
the
proofs
were
brought
as
barry
quinlevin
intended
to
bring
them
she
listened
with
an
abstracted
air
as
he
told
her
that
her
old
nurse
nora
burke
and
a
man
a
friend
of
his
were
to
be
the
other
members
of
their
party
she
showed
some
surprise
and
then
a
mild
interest
but
he
could
see
that
to
moira
her
companions
meant
very
little
she
was
thinking
brooding
somberly
over
what
he
had
told
her
and
his
air
of
confidence
in
his
undertaking
did
nothing
to
give
her
courage
for
her
decision
and
yet
he
knew
that
she
would
abide
by
choice
between
jim
horton
and
himself
and
he
knew
already
what
that
choice
was
to
be
for
reasons
of
his
own
it
was
important
that
jim
horton
and
piquette
should
not
see
him
on
the
train
nor
that
moira
should
be
presented
merely
with
the
evidence
of
the
two
of
them
entering
the
train
the
evidence
must
be
condemnatory
he
would
wait
and
trust
to
circumstances
the
thing
was
simplicity
itself
the
window
into
the
corridor
was
like
a
dispensation
he
passed
the
compartment
once
or
twice
to
make
sure
that
the
shade
of
the
little
window
had
not
been
drawn
and
then
when
it
grew
dark
saw
that
piquette
had
gone
fast
asleep
with
her
head
on
horton
s
shoulder
then
he
acted
quickly
come
he
said
to
moira
it
is
time
i
showed
you
who
is
the
liar
and
resolutely
she
followed
him
saw
nothing
seemed
to
matter
to
her
after
that
incredulity
surprise
and
then
guilt
all
expressed
so
clearly
in
jim
horton
s
face
in
the
brief
moment
when
their
glances
had
met
the
pretty
painted
face
upon
his
shoulder
the
arm
that
he
withdrew
from
around
the
woman
s
waist
her
sudden
awakening
as
he
these
brief
impressions
so
vivid
so
terrible
in
their
significance
armed
her
with
new
strength
and
courage
to
hide
her
pain
from
nora
burke
and
barry
quinlevin
he
watched
her
with
admiration
her
heart
might
be
breaking
but
she
d
never
whimper
now
he
knew
her
are
ye
satisfied
my
dear
he
asked
yes
quite
she
gasped
and
you
ll
be
listening
to
nora
while
she
tells
ye
the
truth
i
will
good
i
must
be
leaving
ye
for
a
while
to
talk
with
my
friend
and
don
t
be
distrusting
me
again
alanah
moira
was
silent
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
into
the
darkness
until
nora
came
and
she
listened
to
the
tale
that
nora
burke
told
or
seemed
to
listen
and
thus
quinlevin
found
them
later
the
girl
s
hand
in
that
of
her
old
nurse
the
announcement
that
they
were
to
get
out
of
the
train
at
etienne
created
no
astonishment
moira
moved
as
in
a
dream
obeying
blindly
as
she
had
always
been
accustomed
to
obey
the
suggestions
of
her
protector
caring
nothing
for
their
significance
and
reassured
as
to
the
integrity
of
his
intentions
with
regard
to
herself
there
was
no
doubting
that
he
loved
her
in
his
strange
way
and
the
fury
he
had
expended
upon
jim
horton
seemed
scarcely
less
than
that
she
now
felt
for
him
a
man
could
a
woman
could
only
despise
she
was
at
least
thankful
when
she
saw
the
train
bearing
the
couple
pass
out
of
her
sight
into
the
darkness
and
followed
quinlevin
where
he
a
hotel
for
the
another
train
in
the
morning
to
marseilles
to
nice
and
the
h√¥tel
ruhl
where
in
the
privacy
of
a
room
of
her
own
she
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
and
gazed
at
the
ceiling
the
attention
of
monsieur
de
vautrin
having
been
attracted
by
piquette
s
news
of
the
immediate
threat
against
his
fortune
it
was
no
longer
difficult
to
persuade
him
to
listen
to
what
jim
horton
had
to
say
madame
thibaud
was
therefore
conducted
with
scant
ceremony
to
an
apartment
in
the
h√¥tel
de
paris
after
which
the
duc
rejoined
piquette
and
jim
in
the
casino
the
unflattering
opinion
jim
horton
had
formed
of
this
french
nobleman
was
upon
closer
acquaintance
in
no
way
modified
the
peevish
and
supercilious
air
with
which
he
had
greeted
piquette
had
changed
to
one
scarcely
less
unpleasant
fidgety
anxiety
and
apprehension
which
revealed
weaknesses
of
fiber
one
would
not
have
expected
to
discover
between
the
points
of
so
long
and
so
imposing
a
mustache
he
gave
jim
the
impression
of
being
very
weary
in
the
pursuit
of
a
and
in
repose
his
face
bore
the
scars
worn
by
those
who
live
for
pleasure
alone
altogether
he
seemed
a
person
scarcely
worth
borrowing
so
much
trouble
about
his
attitude
of
suspicion
toward
jim
horton
was
illy
concealed
but
he
listened
frowning
and
questioning
until
at
last
convinced
of
the
reality
of
his
danger
at
the
hands
of
the
renegade
irish
adventurer
to
whose
venial
cleverness
he
had
so
long
paid
handsome
tribute
but
they
can
do
nothing
he
said
at
last
in
excellent
english
with
an
air
of
bravado
which
was
meant
to
be
effective
and
which
was
only
pitiful
i
m
not
so
sure
about
that
said
jim
the
mere
fact
of
your
having
paid
for
the
support
of
the
child
for
so
many
years
makes
it
seem
as
though
you
believed
in
the
thing
what
do
i
care
i
have
the
money
let
them
take
it
if
they
can
oh
they
ll
take
it
all
right
if
you
don
t
find
some
way
to
meet
their
evidence
lies
yes
of
course
but
you
ve
got
to
prove
that
they
are
where
s
your
defense
you
didn
t
even
know
you
had
a
daughter
until
barry
quinlevin
told
you
you
had
what
proof
have
you
that
your
own
child
died
and
if
you
believed
quinlevin
then
why
shouldn
t
you
believe
him
i
had
my
pardon
me
suspicions
won
t
satisfy
an
irish
court
or
a
french
one
what
proof
have
you
that
madame
horton
isn
t
your
own
child
none
exactly
but
everybody
who
could
have
known
anything
about
the
matter
is
dead
except
nora
burke
and
you
ve
already
heard
what
she
has
to
say
and
what
is
interest
in
this
matter
monsieur
that
s
a
fair
question
said
jim
slowly
i
ll
give
you
a
fair
answer
madame
horton
is
my
brother
s
wife
the
story
i
ve
given
you
is
piquette
will
tell
you
since
she
heard
much
of
it
from
my
brother
your
daughter
died
shortly
after
her
mother
your
wife
my
interest
in
this
affair
is
personal
to
this
extent
i
don
t
intend
to
have
madame
horton
used
any
longer
by
an
unprincipled
blackmailer
surely
then
you
would
have
told
madame
horton
the
truth
and
saved
me
this
ve
told
her
said
jim
slowly
but
she
s
helpless
can
t
you
see
monsieur
it
has
all
been
very
her
she
doesn
t
know
what
to
believe
besides
monsieur
quinlevin
has
the
birth
certificate
and
the
testimony
of
the
nurse
but
if
madame
horton
is
an
honorable
you
can
count
on
that
put
in
horton
quickly
she
doesn
t
want
your
isn
t
quinlevin
s
then
why
doesn
t
she
renounce
him
she
what
difference
would
that
make
she
might
permit
herself
to
think
she
was
joan
of
arc
but
that
wouldn
t
make
her
any
one
but
patricia
madeleine
aulnoy
de
vautrin
if
barry
quinlevin
has
evidence
enough
to
prove
that
she
is
de
vautrin
frowned
darkly
and
twitched
his
jeweled
fingers
but
she
would
have
something
to
say
about
her
own
desires
in
the
matter
he
said
her
own
desires
haven
t
anything
to
do
with
it
see
here
monsieur
de
quinlevin
proves
her
birth
by
a
certificate
he
also
proves
by
the
nurse
that
she
was
the
child
brought
into
his
house
and
the
child
he
has
brought
up
as
his
ward
bearing
his
name
and
accepting
your
money
for
money
monsieur
that
you
paid
to
keep
her
out
of
a
fortune
you
thought
belonged
to
her
but
it
doesn
t
belong
to
her
cried
de
vautrin
gesticulating
it
s
mine
since
the
child
is
dead
monsieur
harry
piquette
broke
in
monsieur
arry
orton
could
be
call
to
the
stan
of
course
but
is
testimony
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
your
brother
yes
monsieur
de
vautrin
replied
jim
my
an
intimate
of
barry
quinlevin
ah
i
accomplice
you
might
call
him
you
like
he
shrugged
and
turned
aside
we
don
t
get
along
my
brother
and
i
but
i
don
t
think
you
ll
find
much
to
gain
by
putting
him
on
the
witness
stand
besides
it
won
t
look
very
pretty
in
the
papers
it
s
as
much
to
my
interest
as
yours
to
keep
it
out
the
duc
eyed
him
suspiciously
again
but
you
must
have
some
other
interest
besides
this
in
wishing
to
help
me
what
s
the
ax
you
have
to
grind
monsieur
jim
horton
grinned
and
shrugged
for
that
is
difficult
to
believe
then
i
would
advise
you
to
tax
your
imagination
to
the
utmost
i
don
t
want
madame
horton
to
figure
in
an
affair
that
she
will
regret
the
rest
of
her
life
but
monsieur
is
in
love
wit
madame
piquette
s
voice
broke
in
very
calmly
there
was
a
silence
for
a
moment
in
which
jim
horton
looked
at
piquette
piquette
gazed
at
de
vautrin
and
de
vautrin
stared
from
one
to
the
other
in
astonishment
his
knowledge
of
the
world
had
given
him
no
instinct
to
appraise
a
situation
such
as
this
but
piquette
met
his
gaze
clearly
it
is
de
trut
olivier
she
repeated
an
now
perhaps
you
on
erstan
it
is
extraordinary
he
gasped
and
you
i
brought
im
to
you
your
interests
are
de
mine
wit
both
if
i
could
believe
jim
horton
rose
aware
of
a
desire
to
pull
the
waxed
mustaches
to
see
if
they
were
real
you
needn
t
believe
it
if
you
don
t
want
to
he
said
carelessly
and
you
don
t
have
to
believe
my
story
but
i
ve
given
you
your
warning
barry
quinlevin
may
be
in
nice
now
with
his
birth
certificate
and
his
nora
burke
he
buttoned
his
overcoat
and
turned
toward
the
door
i
think
i
ll
be
going
back
to
nice
piquette
he
said
coolly
and
then
to
the
bewildered
frenchman
monsieur
one
moment
gasped
the
duc
toddling
after
him
and
catching
him
by
the
hand
i
believe
you
monsieur
why
should
i
not
believe
you
since
what
you
say
is
what
i
wish
to
believe
it
is
all
very
bewildering
i
should
have
thanked
you
long
ago
for
your
kindness
jim
horton
turned
with
a
smile
it
s
about
time
and
it
ought
to
be
fairly
clear
that
i
have
little
interest
in
your
fortune
or
even
in
you
monsieur
i
don
t
mind
being
shot
at
for
my
interference
in
quinlevin
s
affairs
but
i
might
have
been
piquette
would
have
been
worse
and
i
don
t
relish
having
my
word
hers
i
beg
forgiveness
you
have
been
shot
at
piquette
explained
quickly
while
de
vautrin
s
watery
eyes
grew
larger
and
you
say
they
are
coming
here
yes
if
their
dinky
little
train
ever
reaches
its
destination
i
m
afraid
you
re
in
for
it
monsieur
de
vautrin
de
vautrin
threw
out
his
arms
wildly
i
will
not
see
them
i
will
go
away
jim
horton
nodded
that
s
all
it
s
only
putting
off
the
evil
moment
when
they
get
their
evidence
working
you
ll
have
to
meet
it
someway
and
then
what
will
you
do
de
vautrin
had
caught
jim
by
the
coatsleeve
and
pulled
him
down
into
the
seat
beside
him
and
then
with
a
air
which
failed
of
conviction
i
shall
fight
monsieur
with
what
with
the
evidence
you
ve
given
me
it
s
not
enough
horton
shook
his
head
and
laughed
it
looks
to
me
as
though
you
were
elected
president
of
the
quinlevin
endowment
association
but
there
must
be
some
way
of
getting
at
the
truth
cried
the
frenchman
now
really
pitiful
in
his
alarm
ah
that
s
it
laughed
jim
know
madame
horton
is
not
your
daughter
and
know
it
but
that
doesn
t
beat
quinlevin
what
then
monsieur
you
ve
got
to
kill
his
evidence
but
how
with
stronger
evidence
of
your
own
you
haven
t
it
or
any
prospect
of
getting
it
that
i
can
see
so
there
s
only
one
course
open
and
that
monsieur
asked
de
vautrin
eagerly
to
break
down
quinlevin
s
i
m
no
lawyer
but
that
s
only
common
sense
nora
burke
is
a
liar
bribed
with
five
thousand
pounds
and
there
never
was
a
lie
that
didn
t
have
its
weak
points
you
ve
got
to
make
her
speak
the
how
i
don
t
know
but
i
wouldn
t
mind
trying
then
you
ve
got
to
get
that
birth
i
don
t
see
how
you
expect
to
do
that
neither
do
is
no
fool
but
then
he
s
not
either
the
duc
was
silent
appalled
by
the
undertaking
which
had
presented
itself
and
the
calm
way
in
which
his
visitor
discussed
his
projects
filled
him
with
wonder
justice
monsieur
de
vautrin
is
on
your
side
will
you
fight
for
it
assuredly
you
will
but
help
jim
horton
laughed
then
you
no
longer
believe
i
have
an
ax
to
grind
monsieur
and
you
no
longer
cherish
evil
thoughts
of
piquette
upon
my
honor
said
the
duc
a
jeweled
hand
at
his
heart
and
yet
monsieur
you
can
hardly
blame
me
for
some
irritation
at
meeting
her
here
with
you
jim
horton
glanced
toward
the
door
significantly
and
then
dryly
you
hardly
deserve
her
monsieur
de
vautrin
i
am
proud
of
her
friendship
it
s
the
finest
thing
in
my
life
de
vautrin
wagged
his
head
foolishly
and
then
shrugged
a
futile
shoulder
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
monsieur
he
asked
peevishly
horton
lighted
a
cigarette
carefully
and
took
piquette
by
the
hand
first
monsieur
de
vautrin
he
said
coolly
you
will
send
madame
thibaud
about
her
monsieur
said
the
duc
with
a
show
of
dignity
suit
yourself
but
she
s
in
the
way
this
is
no
time
for
fooling
does
she
go
or
doesn
t
she
de
vautrin
s
injured
dignity
trembled
in
the
balance
for
a
moment
and
then
fell
away
merged
in
his
apprehension
for
the
immediate
future
that
doubtless
be
arranged
he
said
with
a
frown
good
said
horton
jovially
and
the
sooner
the
better
it
will
clear
the
atmosphere
amazingly
then
we
will
prepare
to
fight
monsieur
quinlevin
with
his
own
weapons
yes
that
s
what
we
came
here
for
you
ve
made
the
mistake
of
barry
quinlevin
he
s
desperate
he
is
playing
a
big
game
and
if
you
don
t
want
to
be
the
goat
you
ll
do
what
i
advise
i
m
listening
if
i
m
not
mistaken
he
will
reach
here
afternoon
with
madame
horton
and
nora
burke
and
you
ve
got
to
see
them
in
your
rooms
in
the
h√¥tel
de
paris
you
will
give
it
out
that
you
are
here
for
a
week
they
must
take
rooms
in
monte
carlo
then
you
will
listen
politely
to
everything
quinlevin
has
to
everything
nora
burke
has
to
say
but
you
yourself
will
say
nothing
but
you
monsieur
i
shall
be
in
an
adjoining
room
but
they
must
not
know
it
but
barry
quinlevin
will
discover
that
you
have
been
here
of
course
you
will
tell
him
that
they
will
tell
you
that
i
have
lied
but
you
won
t
believe
them
and
then
you
will
tell
them
that
i
have
gone
away
but
when
will
you
come
in
to
my
assistance
that
depends
upon
what
i
hear
through
the
keyhole
but
would
it
not
be
simpler
to
pay
this
nora
burke
for
telling
the
truth
horton
laughed
it
does
seem
simple
doesn
t
it
i
don
t
know
much
about
french
law
but
i
wouldn
t
want
to
be
caught
at
it
out
where
i
come
from
let
s
play
this
game
straight
and
trust
to
luck
if
quinlevin
is
too
sharp
for
us
we
ll
try
something
else
do
you
agree
of
course
monsieur
and
so
it
was
settled
on
the
following
morning
madame
thibaud
was
sent
back
to
paris
and
piquette
and
jim
horton
ostentatiously
took
the
train
for
nice
returning
subsequently
by
automobile
to
monte
carlo
where
they
were
hidden
in
rooms
in
the
h√¥tel
de
paris
in
this
they
were
aided
by
an
official
of
the
hotel
who
proved
to
be
an
old
acquaintance
of
piquette
s
in
paris
and
so
when
barry
quinlevin
arrived
from
nice
in
the
afternoon
with
moira
and
nora
burke
inquiring
for
the
duc
the
information
was
conveyed
directly
to
horton
who
was
happy
to
learn
that
tricot
had
not
yet
caught
up
with
the
party
monsieur
de
vautrin
who
had
been
carefully
rehearsed
in
the
part
he
was
to
play
seemed
to
enter
into
the
game
with
some
spirit
and
was
sent
over
to
the
casino
to
play
et
where
after
awhile
barry
quinlevin
found
him
deeply
absorbed
in
his
game
of
chance
the
duc
manifested
polite
surprise
quinlevin
polite
insistence
and
then
they
talked
for
awhile
the
duc
indifferently
quinlevin
impressively
the
end
that
an
appointment
was
made
for
an
hour
later
the
following
afternoon
in
the
duc
s
apartment
where
he
would
listen
in
all
good
nature
and
tolerance
to
what
his
visitors
would
have
to
say
he
hoped
his
daughter
was
handsome
it
would
be
a
pity
if
all
this
money
was
to
go
to
one
who
could
not
use
it
with
dignity
all
this
in
an
ironic
and
jocular
mood
which
only
brought
a
dour
smile
upon
quinlevin
s
face
but
the
main
object
of
the
preliminary
encounter
was
achieved
for
barry
quinlevin
accepted
without
reservation
the
duc
s
assertion
that
jim
horton
having
performed
his
mission
had
returned
to
paris
when
the
hour
of
the
appointment
arrived
jim
horton
sat
behind
the
door
into
the
bedroom
of
monsieur
de
vautrin
carefully
studying
the
pages
of
an
dictionary
the
duc
sat
over
his
paper
with
an
air
of
unconcern
he
was
far
from
feeling
piquette
at
the
american
s
instructions
was
elsewhere
quinlevin
shown
to
the
door
of
the
room
by
a
servant
of
the
hotel
met
the
duc
with
his
most
amiable
smile
and
introduced
the
women
of
his
party
moira
was
pale
nora
burke
uncomfortable
but
arrogant
monsieur
de
vautrin
quinlevin
began
with
something
of
an
air
permit
me
to
present
to
ye
yer
daughter
patricia
madeleine
aulnoy
de
vautrin
the
duc
smiled
politely
stared
moira
who
as
though
in
duty
had
taken
a
step
toward
him
paused
and
then
as
she
saw
the
look
that
monsieur
de
vautrin
swept
over
her
the
color
flamed
into
her
cheeks
the
duc
s
rebuff
gave
for
the
first
time
a
true
perception
of
the
position
in
which
she
had
voluntarily
placed
herself
if
she
were
a
mere
adventuress
he
could
not
have
accused
her
more
eloquently
and
the
admiration
in
his
impudent
stare
was
even
more
insulting
this
effete
impossible
and
the
repulsion
she
felt
at
the
sight
of
him
made
her
wish
only
to
go
anywhere
away
from
the
sight
of
him
what
else
she
had
expected
she
didn
t
know
for
even
barry
quinlevin
had
not
been
too
explicit
as
to
what
would
be
likely
to
happen
but
there
was
her
mentor
at
her
side
a
gentle
hand
upon
her
elbow
urging
her
forward
into
the
by
the
window
which
monsieur
de
vautrin
was
indicating
with
a
rather
exaggerated
gesture
of
formality
thanks
monsieur
said
quinlevin
with
an
easy
laugh
sinking
into
another
chair
ye
re
not
to
be
blamed
for
not
flying
to
each
other
s
arms
after
all
these
years
when
yer
acquaintance
in
the
beginning
was
to
say
the
least
a
most
trivial
affair
but
in
a
while
perhaps
ye
ll
be
knowing
each
other
better
and
i
m
sure
monsieur
ye
ll
be
finding
my
ward
as
i
have
done
a
fine
creature
capable
of
a
most
filial
devotion
ah
said
de
vautrin
i
don
t
doubt
that
it
would
truly
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
discover
so
beautiful
a
creature
to
be
a
daughter
of
mine
but
the
facts
of
the
matter
one
moment
monsieur
broke
in
quinlevin
before
we
arrive
at
the
facts
in
the
matter
ye
must
be
aware
that
this
situation
is
none
of
my
ward
s
choosing
she
came
because
she
knew
that
it
was
a
sacred
duty
which
she
owed
to
the
memory
of
her
mother
many
years
have
passed
since
yer
ye
away
from
ireland
and
she
lays
no
fault
to
yerself
for
yer
desertion
for
which
i
have
taken
all
the
blame
she
knows
that
ye
ve
provided
for
her
comfortably
and
that
i
have
made
it
my
pleasure
to
act
as
yer
substitute
as
well
as
i
could
but
the
time
has
come
when
she
must
take
her
place
in
the
world
to
which
she
belongs
and
it
s
my
duty
to
be
putting
her
there
to
this
end
as
ye
ll
see
i
ve
brought
with
me
her
old
nurse
nora
burke
with
whom
ye
re
already
acquainted
and
who
will
be
answering
any
questions
that
ye
would
like
to
put
to
her
monsieur
de
vautrin
frowned
and
moved
his
gaze
from
moira
to
the
servant
who
stood
her
large
hands
badly
gloved
folded
upon
her
stomach
her
feet
shifting
uneasily
i
ve
heard
something
of
nora
burke
s
story
said
de
vautrin
dryly
but
there
are
parts
of
it
that
i
have
not
heard
ye
re
quite
at
liberty
to
question
monsieur
put
in
quinlevin
nora
too
is
merely
an
instrument
of
truth
in
the
hand
of
providence
since
providence
has
ceased
providing
said
the
duc
dryly
i
comprehend
but
i
will
listen
to
this
extraordinary
tale
again
since
i
have
promised
to
do
so
it
can
do
no
harm
proceed
nora
burke
my
poor
wife
you
say
engaged
you
some
weeks
before
my
daughter
was
born
she
did
yer
and
as
the
woman
go
on
nora
said
quinlevin
the
choild
was
born
this
very
girl
they
call
moira
quinlevin
who
sits
before
ye
a
beautiful
choild
she
was
fine
and
healthy
that
the
poor
duchesse
never
lived
to
see
for
she
died
that
night
god
rest
her
soul
faded
away
before
our
very
eyes
and
who
was
there
beside
yourself
asked
the
duc
coolly
dominick
finucane
the
doctor
from
athlone
and
father
reilly
the
priest
who
gave
her
and
who
has
since
died
said
de
vautrin
dryly
yes
yer
the
birth
certificate
i
was
afther
kapin
since
no
father
came
near
us
nor
any
relation
mary
callonby
was
a
lonely
kind
and
when
she
came
back
to
galway
took
to
living
on
the
small
farm
with
only
the
one
servant
boyle
to
look
afther
her
and
boyle
is
also
dead
put
in
de
vautrin
keenly
she
is
it
s
very
unfortunate
that
all
the
witnesses
have
seen
fit
to
die
all
but
me
yer
highness
said
nora
assertively
de
vautrin
shrugged
well
what
happened
then
well
boyle
and
meself
we
didn
t
know
what
to
be
afther
doing
so
we
just
followed
the
advice
of
father
reilly
and
what
did
he
tell
you
to
do
nora
glanced
at
quinlevin
who
nodded
in
a
whoile
he
brought
barry
gentleman
lived
on
the
only
place
nearby
and
tould
us
to
be
going
to
his
home
quinlevin
was
afther
bein
very
lonely
he
said
his
own
wife
and
colleen
havin
died
a
few
months
before
that
was
kind
of
mr
quinlevin
we
thought
it
was
kind
of
father
reilly
nobody
was
afther
coming
to
see
about
the
poor
choild
and
quinlevin
was
that
watched
the
babby
like
it
was
his
that
s
true
enough
he
would
sneered
the
duc
and
what
happened
then
boyle
and
i
we
lived
in
the
house
of
quinlevin
her
as
cook
and
me
as
nurse
bringin
up
the
choild
as
miss
moira
quinlevin
in
the
house
for
wakes
at
a
toime
when
quinlevin
was
afther
bein
away
to
london
or
paris
on
business
but
all
the
whoile
i
was
kapin
the
birth
certificate
an
all
the
whoile
tryin
me
best
to
take
the
place
of
poor
mary
callonby
and
you
were
well
paid
for
this
service
asked
de
vautrin
i
had
me
wages
it
was
enough
and
when
you
heard
that
quinlevin
had
seen
me
in
paris
two
years
afterward
you
received
more
money
nora
s
glance
sought
quinlevin
who
broke
in
calmly
i
gave
nora
as
well
as
boyle
a
bit
more
ye
proper
share
of
the
sum
for
the
support
of
the
child
and
they
agreed
to
say
nothing
he
fingered
in
his
pocket
and
brought
forth
a
paper
this
as
ye
can
plainly
see
is
a
copy
of
the
birth
certificate
of
yer
child
and
the
original
asked
the
duc
will
be
produced
at
the
proper
time
said
quinlevin
shrewdly
de
vautrin
took
the
paper
and
read
it
carefully
and
where
is
boyle
at
the
present
moment
he
asked
dead
also
three
weeks
ago
said
quinlevin
calmly
it
s
most
her
signature
can
be
verified
and
father
reilly
also
of
course
said
the
duc
with
a
quick
glance
toward
his
bedroom
door
and
there
are
other
papers
yes
said
quinlevin
letters
from
yer
guarantee
yer
verbal
agreement
in
paris
the
will
of
patrick
callonby
and
a
few
other
trifles
which
are
important
to
ye
and
you
think
your
case
is
complete
oh
yes
quite
an
irish
court
won
t
hesitate
very
long
just
at
this
time
in
carrying
out
the
provisions
of
this
will
monsieur
de
vautrin
smiled
and
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
he
asked
quietly
to
perform
merely
an
act
of
restitution
an
act
of
justice
to
yer
own
ye
know
the
terms
of
the
will
in
the
event
of
the
mother
dying
her
fortune
was
to
revert
unconditionally
to
the
child
but
she
s
to
be
considerate
of
yer
age
and
the
relation
that
exists
between
ye
which
however
strange
it
may
seem
to
ye
both
at
this
time
is
that
of
father
and
only
daughter
ye
ve
both
formed
the
habits
of
yer
living
in
paris
and
london
yer
daughter
is
disposed
to
be
generous
and
does
not
wish
to
interfere
with
yer
plans
for
the
future
she
will
if
you
please
still
keep
the
matter
secret
and
go
on
living
with
to
continue
in
the
comfortable
life
of
yer
bachelorhood
and
your
terms
asked
de
vautrin
quietly
barry
quinlevin
pocketed
the
copy
of
the
birth
certificate
which
monsieur
de
vautrin
had
put
upon
the
table
as
to
terms
that
won
t
be
made
difficult
the
estate
of
patrick
callonby
was
reckoned
at
a
million
pounds
ll
say
twenty
millions
of
francs
or
ye
re
not
a
man
of
business
and
allowing
for
depreciation
give
yer
daughter
proper
securities
to
the
amount
of
one
third
of
her
fortune
and
she
will
assign
the
other
two
thirds
to
quinlevin
paused
for
when
the
terms
were
mentioned
monsieur
de
vautrin
had
begun
to
smile
and
now
burst
into
an
unpleasant
laugh
well
monsieur
de
vautrin
broke
off
quinlevin
angrily
it
s
merely
he
replied
that
you
don
t
figure
enough
for
depreciation
what
do
ye
mean
years
is
a
long
while
and
you
are
right
when
you
say
that
i
am
no
man
of
business
my
fortune
has
diminished
year
by
year
and
since
the
it
has
vanished
into
thin
air
the
estate
of
patrick
callonby
monsieur
is
now
a
myth
barry
quinlevin
rose
trying
to
keep
his
temper
there
are
ways
of
verifying
yer
statements
monsieur
of
course
i
commend
you
to
them
and
nora
burke
who
might
have
told
me
the
truth
last
summer
in
ireland
when
i
was
disposed
to
be
generous
i
ve
tould
the
truth
asserted
nora
doggedly
in
spite
of
her
bewilderment
and
how
much
more
will
you
tell
when
there
s
no
money
for
the
telling
said
de
vautrin
rising
for
at
this
moment
the
door
into
the
adjoining
room
opened
and
jim
horton
strode
quickly
into
the
room
makes
a
horton
did
not
look
at
moira
and
quickly
sought
out
the
tall
figure
of
the
astonished
irishman
who
stood
by
the
table
glaring
angrily
what
s
this
monsieur
de
vautrin
le
asked
i
beg
pardon
said
horton
quickly
but
my
departure
has
been
delayed
by
the
necessity
for
presenting
some
evidence
which
had
been
overlooked
by
mr
quinlevin
a
de
vautrin
stormed
the
irishman
i
ll
have
none
of
him
and
moved
toward
the
door
into
the
corridor
but
jim
horton
had
reached
it
ahead
of
him
and
quickly
locking
the
door
put
the
key
into
his
pocket
turned
quickly
his
height
topping
quinlevin
s
his
bulk
dominating
him
i
m
afraid
you
must
said
horton
coolly
quinlevin
struggled
for
his
temper
and
then
realizing
that
he
was
doing
his
cause
no
good
shrugged
a
careless
shoulder
and
glanced
toward
the
door
into
the
adjoining
room
and
yer
de
is
she
to
be
with
us
also
he
said
insultingly
for
moira
s
benefit
horton
met
moira
s
glance
as
she
took
a
pace
forward
toward
him
by
what
right
do
you
keep
me
here
against
my
will
she
asked
in
angry
disdain
he
faced
her
coolly
by
every
right
you
ve
given
act
in
your
interest
whether
you
wish
it
or
not
i
m
quite
capable
of
looking
after
my
own
affairs
she
cut
in
quickly
he
smiled
quietly
if
i
thought
so
i
shouldn
t
be
here
will
you
unlock
that
door
she
asked
icily
he
did
not
move
and
his
level
gaze
met
hers
calmly
no
he
said
gently
i
won
t
oh
she
gasped
furiously
then
turned
her
back
and
went
to
the
window
where
she
stood
silently
looking
down
over
the
garden
without
noticing
her
further
horton
turned
toward
quinlevin
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
your
conversation
with
me
in
the
hospital
at
neuilly
quinlevin
and
the
intimate
that
bind
me
to
your
harry
horton
quinlevin
had
sunk
into
a
chair
in
an
attitude
of
careless
grace
and
playing
this
old
gambler
s
game
smiled
grimly
up
into
the
face
of
the
enemy
yer
talents
for
the
dramatic
will
be
getting
ye
into
trouble
horton
i
ve
only
to
be
asking
moira
to
shout
for
help
from
the
window
to
land
ye
in
a
jail
but
i
confess
to
some
idle
curiosity
as
to
yer
reasons
for
this
behavior
and
i
warn
ye
that
when
ye
unlock
the
door
i
ll
see
ye
into
the
prison
at
monaco
in
the
meanwhile
i
ll
tell
ye
that
what
ye
say
will
be
held
against
ye
and
what
of
the
evidence
i
hold
against
barry
quinlevin
the
evidence
of
a
deserter
from
the
american
army
quinlevin
sneered
let
it
be
brief
and
to
the
point
corporal
horton
you
don
t
alarm
me
said
horton
calmly
i
ve
discounted
that
give
me
up
to
the
provost
guard
and
my
brother
will
go
on
the
witness
stand
against
me
but
against
you
too
quinlevin
in
monsieur
de
vautrin
s
interests
horton
laughed
easily
as
the
irishman
refused
a
reply
come
perhaps
it
won
t
be
necessary
to
go
so
far
as
that
if
your
friend
tricot
had
done
his
shooting
at
marboeuf
a
little
lower
neither
piquette
nor
i
would
be
here
to
oppose
you
jim
horton
saw
moira
turn
from
the
window
with
startled
eyes
at
tricot
s
name
but
he
went
on
carelessly
but
here
i
am
and
i
m
not
easy
to
kill
quinlevin
if
i
came
through
at
boissi√®re
wood
i
m
not
likely
to
get
hit
now
so
you
d
better
listen
to
me
i
ve
been
doing
little
else
these
ten
minutes
horton
said
quinlevin
yawning
politely
i
won
t
waste
any
more
time
than
i
can
help
but
when
you
promise
nora
burke
five
thousand
pounds
for
telling
a
lie
i
want
to
give
her
her
money
s
worth
he
turned
to
the
old
woman
with
a
frown
as
he
caught
her
off
her
guard
but
quinlevin
broke
in
quickly
see
here
horton
i
ve
had
about
enough
of
the
irishman
rose
furiously
but
horton
took
a
quick
pace
toward
him
keep
your
hands
out
of
your
pockets
quinlevin
he
shouted
warningly
i
m
younger
than
quicker
that
s
better
and
monsieur
de
vautrin
you
will
please
close
the
window
the
interview
is
apt
to
be
noisy
the
irishman
knew
that
he
was
no
match
in
physical
strength
for
the
american
and
so
he
sank
into
his
chair
again
horton
near
him
in
a
commanding
position
where
he
could
watch
nora
burke
he
was
conscious
of
moira
s
gaze
from
the
corner
by
de
vautrin
she
had
not
spoken
but
he
knew
that
he
had
her
attention
again
five
thousand
pounds
for
a
lie
he
said
distinctly
over
quinlevin
s
head
that
s
true
isn
t
it
nora
but
the
woman
had
had
time
to
regain
some
of
her
composure
after
the
sudden
shock
of
his
first
accusation
and
turned
on
him
defiantly
it
is
not
she
replied
and
the
man
lies
who
says
it
even
if
it
was
quinlevin
himself
said
horton
say
nothing
nora
the
irishman
s
voice
broke
in
quickly
no
one
can
make
you
speak
but
when
he
silence
horton
shrugged
as
you
please
but
she
ll
have
to
answer
later
and
it
won
t
be
so
easy
then
five
thousand
pounds
is
a
lot
of
it
s
a
silence
from
quinlevin
it
s
a
mighty
small
sum
nora
burke
for
so
big
a
lie
when
the
woman
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
again
quinlevin
silenced
her
with
a
gesture
but
her
face
was
flushed
and
she
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
glaring
at
her
tormentor
who
it
seemed
had
just
begun
his
inquisition
horton
smiled
at
her
grimly
it
s
a
mighty
small
sum
as
you
re
not
going
to
get
any
of
quinlevin
has
other
means
at
his
disposal
i
want
no
money
from
mr
quinlevin
then
you
re
just
lying
for
the
fun
of
it
do
you
happen
to
know
what
the
penalty
for
is
in
france
don
t
let
him
frighten
you
nora
interjected
the
irishman
it
s
excommunication
said
horton
grinning
at
his
own
invention
nora
was
silent
but
her
face
was
a
study
in
her
varying
emotions
she
had
not
bargained
for
this
and
her
knees
were
shaking
under
her
quinlevin
s
laugh
reassured
her
a
little
i
m
not
believin
she
muttered
you
don
t
have
to
believe
you
ll
wish
you
d
never
left
galway
when
monsieur
de
vautrin
s
lawyer
gets
through
with
nothing
at
the
end
of
it
all
but
a
french
jail
i
never
did
any
harm
in
me
life
except
to
forget
to
speak
the
truth
you
re
getting
old
nora
maybe
that
s
what
s
the
matter
with
your
memory
because
monsieur
de
vautrin
is
certain
that
the
facts
about
the
birth
of
his
child
are
quite
different
from
those
you
ve
related
you
ve
said
that
mary
callonby
s
child
was
this
very
girl
called
moira
i
was
blurted
nora
furiously
and
before
she
very
gave
the
child
a
christian
name
she
did
you
re
very
sure
of
this
warned
quinlevin
i
m
sure
of
it
why
wouldn
t
cried
nora
when
i
was
hearin
the
very
words
of
her
tongue
and
the
child
was
a
girl
quinlevin
rose
glaring
at
horton
silence
nora
then
why
insisted
horton
if
the
child
was
a
girl
was
it
given
the
christian
name
of
a
boy
a
nora
burke
started
back
a
pace
her
round
foolish
face
usually
florid
now
the
color
of
putty
nora
quinlevin
roared
keep
silent
d
ye
hear
but
it
was
too
late
to
repair
the
damage
done
horton
had
not
taken
his
gaze
from
nora
burke
s
face
and
he
knew
that
he
had
struck
his
mark
he
was
aware
of
moira
who
had
come
forward
and
was
leaning
on
the
table
near
him
watching
as
eagerly
as
he
jim
horton
shrugged
and
brought
quickly
from
his
pocket
a
small
red
book
which
he
opened
at
a
page
carefully
this
little
book
is
a
dictionary
of
french
and
english
nora
it
s
a
very
good
dictionary
here
s
a
page
of
christian
names
in
french
and
in
english
here
you
are
can
you
tell
me
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
sensible
why
mary
callonby
named
the
child
patrick
unless
it
was
a
boy
nora
gasped
for
breath
once
or
twice
glancing
at
quinlevin
who
shrugged
and
frowned
the
name
upon
the
birth
certificate
is
patricia
he
growled
then
who
changed
it
asked
horton
keenly
glaring
at
nora
not
i
sor
can
t
write
she
gasped
jim
horton
laughed
it
couldn
t
have
been
father
reilly
or
finucane
perhaps
quinlevin
will
produce
the
certificate
when
the
time
comes
gasped
quinlevin
ye
ll
see
a
court
of
law
and
the
death
certificate
of
your
own
child
too
mr
quinlevin
asked
horton
amiably
too
he
stammered
in
his
rage
as
he
faced
the
american
but
you
won
t
be
there
to
see
for
on
my
evidence
you
ll
be
shot
my
friend
the
masquerader
i
ll
have
to
run
that
moira
s
voice
tense
shrill
with
nervousness
broke
in
as
she
caught
quinlevin
by
the
arm
no
never
you
will
not
dare
i
forbid
it
we
ll
see
to
the
duc
who
at
last
seemed
to
have
recovered
his
initiative
came
forward
with
an
air
of
alacrity
perhaps
monsieur
horton
it
is
just
as
well
if
you
now
unlock
the
door
horton
looked
at
his
wrist
watch
willingly
oblige
me
monsieur
and
he
handed
de
vautrin
the
key
unless
there
are
some
further
matters
quinlevin
wishes
to
discuss
jim
s
gaze
met
moira
s
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
and
brief
as
it
was
he
seemed
to
find
a
glimpse
of
that
fool
s
paradise
in
which
he
had
lived
for
a
while
and
then
her
glance
turned
from
him
to
quinlevin
as
she
moved
past
horton
toward
the
door
nora
burke
her
stolidity
shaken
her
arrogant
mien
fallen
amid
the
wreck
of
her
probity
sent
a
fleeting
glance
over
her
shoulder
toward
the
long
mustaches
of
de
vautrin
and
stumbled
after
moira
but
the
duc
was
in
high
feather
again
and
fairly
danced
to
the
door
will
you
give
me
your
paris
address
that
i
may
send
you
the
money
barry
quinlevin
he
shouted
after
him
into
the
corridor
there
was
no
reply
quinlevin
s
clever
house
of
cards
had
toppled
and
fallen
but
horton
followed
down
the
corridor
when
they
turned
the
corner
and
watched
what
happened
at
the
landing
the
irishman
made
a
gesture
and
the
two
women
went
in
the
direction
of
their
rooms
while
quinlevin
passed
down
the
stairs
when
horton
returned
to
the
room
the
duc
closed
the
door
and
came
delightedly
toward
him
ah
it
was
as
good
as
a
play
how
did
you
know
that
my
child
was
not
a
a
boy
i
didn
t
know
it
sighed
horton
with
a
laugh
i
guessed
it
but
you
must
i
got
to
night
the
whole
story
was
a
shouldn
t
this
be
a
part
of
it
but
a
suspicion
wasn
t
enough
for
a
starter
monsieur
you
ll
admit
it
have
been
a
boy
just
because
you
always
the
child
was
a
girl
that
didn
t
make
it
one
i
lay
awake
phrases
in
quinlevin
s
talk
in
the
studio
came
back
to
me
and
i
began
to
think
about
the
name
patrice
said
little
hard
to
read
patricia
it
just
phrases
but
this
meant
something
me
boy
a
little
horton
turned
with
a
quick
gesture
why
should
the
name
patricia
be
illegible
when
all
the
rest
was
clear
but
you
said
nothing
of
this
to
me
muttered
the
duc
i
wasn
t
sure
i
sent
out
for
the
dictionary
it
had
the
christian
names
in
the
back
patrice
was
patrick
there
wasn
t
any
patricia
you
french
have
a
way
of
giving
males
and
females
the
same
names
anyway
knew
a
frenchman
in
america
with
madeleine
for
a
middle
name
aulnoy
might
be
a
family
yes
your
wife
wanted
your
family
name
in
she
wanted
her
father
s
name
she
called
the
boy
can
prove
this
now
i
think
assuredly
monsieur
said
de
vautrin
you
are
a
genius
no
i
m
only
a
good
guesser
but
it
worked
i
got
the
poor
thing
rattled
and
when
i
saw
nora
s
face
i
knew
i
d
hit
with
the
second
barrel
outside
it
was
getting
dark
horton
went
to
the
window
and
peered
out
monsieur
de
vautrin
there
s
nothing
to
keep
you
here
now
he
said
it
may
be
even
dangerous
to
remain
you
must
go
away
incognito
and
by
the
first
train
you
ve
been
very
careless
with
your
affairs
lay
your
entire
case
in
the
hands
of
your
him
all
that
has
happened
here
and
sending
to
ireland
for
a
careful
search
of
the
birth
records
of
the
parish
of
but
you
monsieur
what
will
you
do
i
shall
stay
here
awhile
there
s
something
else
that
i
must
do
and
i
will
see
that
she
returns
safely
you
are
very
good
monsieur
said
the
duc
will
you
forgive
me
for
my
suspicions
yes
if
you
will
promise
to
give
piquette
the
affection
she
deserves
she
is
a
child
monsieur
with
great
good
and
she
becomes
will
depend
upon
your
treatment
of
her
she
has
saved
me
from
great
trouble
bringing
you
my
horton
moved
into
the
bed
room
and
picked
up
his
hat
don
t
let
that
trouble
you
he
said
and
then
offered
his
hand
glad
to
have
met
you
monsieur
i
will
see
you
in
paris
in
a
week
but
don
t
waste
any
time
getting
out
of
here
de
you
understand
paris
in
a
week
monsieur
and
with
a
quick
wave
of
his
hand
horton
went
out
and
walked
rapidly
down
the
corridor
the
interview
with
quinlevin
had
served
a
double
purpose
he
had
succeeded
beyond
all
hope
in
finding
out
what
he
had
wanted
to
know
and
he
had
so
occupied
the
irishman
s
time
that
piquette
could
proceed
unmolested
in
making
an
investigation
of
her
own
he
hurried
up
to
her
room
to
meet
her
as
agreed
watching
the
corridor
he
knocked
by
a
preconcerted
signal
there
was
no
reply
after
a
moment
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
room
was
empty
piquette
was
fearless
but
she
was
also
clever
it
was
her
thought
that
barry
quinlevin
would
take
no
chances
with
the
original
birth
certificate
and
other
papers
in
the
apartment
of
monsieur
de
vautrin
it
was
her
suggestion
that
she
be
permitted
to
take
advantage
of
the
absence
of
quinlevin
and
his
party
to
make
a
thorough
search
of
the
rooms
for
any
private
papers
and
in
this
she
was
aided
and
abetted
by
monsieur
jacquot
in
the
office
of
the
hotel
to
whom
she
explained
as
much
as
was
necessary
and
who
provided
the
keys
and
wished
her
luck
in
her
undertaking
jim
had
allowed
her
an
hour
for
the
investigation
during
which
period
he
had
promised
to
keep
quinlevin
prisoner
here
then
piquette
reached
new
heights
of
for
in
helping
jim
in
the
cause
of
moira
she
worked
against
her
own
interests
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
moira
quinlevin
jim
had
opened
her
eyes
to
her
obligations
to
monsieur
de
vautrin
but
she
had
done
her
duty
merely
because
jim
had
asked
it
of
her
he
had
kissed
her
as
though
she
were
a
queen
she
could
never
forget
that
but
in
spite
of
any
mental
reservations
she
may
have
had
in
doing
something
in
the
interest
of
the
girl
jim
horton
loved
she
was
conscious
of
a
thrill
of
keen
interest
in
the
task
that
she
had
set
herself
and
piquette
went
about
her
investigation
methodically
waiting
on
the
steps
from
the
upper
landing
until
quinlevin
and
the
two
women
had
entered
the
room
of
the
duc
when
keys
in
hand
she
made
her
way
quickly
to
the
rooms
quinlevin
had
engaged
there
were
three
of
them
with
connecting
doors
and
with
a
quick
glance
along
the
empty
corridor
she
entered
the
nearest
one
an
ancient
valise
and
a
flannel
wrapper
proclaimed
its
there
might
be
something
of
interest
it
was
doubtful
for
barry
quinlevin
was
hardly
a
man
to
leave
nora
in
possession
of
any
documents
that
were
better
kept
in
his
own
hands
but
piquette
nevertheless
searched
carefully
and
for
her
trouble
found
nothing
the
door
into
the
adjoining
room
that
of
madame
horton
was
open
showing
how
quickly
and
easily
an
had
been
between
moira
quinlevin
and
her
old
nurse
at
the
threshold
of
this
room
piquette
paused
glancing
with
a
delicate
frown
at
the
articles
of
feminine
apparel
on
bed
and
dressing
stand
she
sniffed
scenting
the
air
delicately
her
chin
raised
violette
then
she
approached
the
bed
and
took
a
white
garment
and
rubbed
it
critically
between
thumb
and
forefinger
said
piquette
again
a
pair
of
stockings
small
slipper
which
she
measured
with
her
own
shrugged
and
then
searched
the
suit
case
and
dressing
table
thoroughly
of
paper
there
was
even
a
the
door
into
barry
quinlevin
s
room
was
bolted
on
the
side
where
piquette
stood
she
went
back
through
the
rooms
that
she
had
passed
to
be
sure
that
nothing
had
been
disarranged
locked
the
outside
door
of
nora
burke
s
room
as
she
had
found
it
and
then
went
back
to
quinlevin
s
door
which
she
opened
quickly
and
peered
around
here
there
was
a
field
for
more
careful
investigation
a
a
a
bed
some
chairs
a
of
them
she
took
in
in
a
quick
inspection
the
if
locked
she
meant
to
take
it
bodily
away
it
wasn
t
locked
she
had
a
slight
sense
of
disappointment
it
contained
a
change
of
some
collars
socks
a
box
of
cigars
and
a
bottle
of
irish
whisky
all
of
these
she
scrutinized
with
care
as
well
as
the
cloth
lining
and
the
receptacles
in
the
lid
and
then
arranging
the
contents
as
she
had
found
them
straightened
with
a
short
breath
and
looked
elsewhere
no
monsieur
quinlevin
would
have
hidden
such
important
papers
more
cleverly
than
that
where
then
in
a
place
so
obvious
that
no
one
would
think
of
looking
there
for
them
that
was
an
ancient
trick
well
known
to
the
police
but
after
she
had
looked
around
the
room
she
examined
the
bed
minutely
running
her
nimble
fingers
along
the
ticking
of
the
mattress
the
pillows
dismantling
the
bed
completely
and
then
satisfied
that
she
had
exhausted
this
possibility
remade
it
skillfully
next
the
inch
by
inch
inside
and
out
then
the
upholstery
of
the
chairs
straightening
at
last
puzzled
and
yet
she
knew
that
the
birth
certificate
must
be
in
these
rooms
somewhere
she
moved
the
rugs
examined
the
ashes
in
the
fireplace
the
base
board
and
molding
took
down
the
pictures
from
the
walls
and
then
baffled
sank
into
the
arm
chair
for
a
moment
to
think
could
quinlevin
have
taken
the
precaution
to
leave
the
documents
in
the
safe
at
the
h√¥tel
ruhl
in
nice
or
would
he
perhaps
have
deposited
them
downstairs
in
the
of
the
h√¥tel
de
paris
in
that
event
monsieur
her
friend
would
help
but
her
hour
had
not
yet
expired
there
were
a
few
moments
left
where
else
was
she
to
look
she
glanced
at
the
picture
molding
the
walls
the
electric
light
brackets
by
the
bed
and
then
rose
for
a
last
and
possibly
futile
and
despairing
effort
she
ran
her
sensitive
fingers
over
the
bracket
by
the
bed
it
was
affixed
to
the
wall
by
a
hexagonal
brass
plate
held
by
a
small
screw
she
tried
to
move
the
screw
with
her
fingers
but
it
resisted
so
she
ran
to
the
for
a
nail
file
and
in
a
moment
had
moved
the
brass
plate
from
the
wall
a
patch
of
broken
and
wires
in
a
small
no
papers
she
screwed
the
plate
carefully
into
place
and
turned
to
the
other
fixture
over
the
this
was
her
last
venture
but
she
had
determined
to
make
it
and
felt
a
slight
thrill
of
expectation
when
the
screw
of
the
first
bracket
moved
easily
in
her
fingers
she
loosened
the
plate
and
as
it
came
out
from
the
surface
of
the
wall
there
was
a
sibilant
rustle
and
something
slipped
down
behind
the
to
the
floor
eager
now
with
excitement
she
thrust
her
fingers
behind
the
plate
and
brought
forth
some
papers
these
she
examined
quickly
in
amazement
then
carefully
screwed
the
bracket
into
its
place
recovering
the
other
paper
that
had
fallen
to
the
the
papers
that
she
had
taken
from
behind
the
bracket
she
could
not
understand
but
the
paper
that
she
had
recovered
from
the
floor
was
the
much
desired
birth
certificate
of
the
dead
child
the
light
was
failing
but
in
the
shadow
of
the
hangings
of
the
french
window
she
stood
and
read
the
name
patricia
madeleine
aulnoy
de
vautrin
she
was
filled
with
the
joy
of
her
success
and
so
absorbed
in
the
perusal
of
the
paper
that
she
did
not
hear
the
small
sounds
that
came
from
the
adjoining
room
nor
was
she
aware
of
the
tall
dark
figure
of
the
girl
with
the
pale
face
who
for
a
long
moment
had
stood
in
the
doorway
watching
her
in
silent
amazement
and
it
was
not
until
moira
spoke
that
piquette
turned
the
papers
hidden
behind
her
and
met
the
steady
gaze
of
the
woman
jim
horton
loved
what
are
you
doing
in
this
room
asked
moira
steadily
piquette
sent
one
fleeting
glance
at
her
then
stepped
out
upon
the
sill
of
the
french
window
which
extended
to
the
floor
when
she
turned
toward
moira
a
little
pale
and
breathing
rapidly
her
hands
were
empty
what
did
you
throw
out
of
the
window
what
are
you
doing
here
moira
asked
again
moving
quickly
to
the
by
the
door
answer
me
or
i
ll
ring
piquette
by
this
time
had
recovered
some
of
her
composure
oh
madame
it
is
not
necessaire
to
ring
she
said
easily
i
can
explain
myself
if
you
will
but
listen
you
have
no
right
in
this
you
are
a
servant
of
the
hotel
and
that
you
are
no
madame
said
piquette
coolly
i
am
no
servant
of
de
hotel
but
strange
to
say
even
agains
my
will
i
am
your
frien
my
friend
who
are
you
piquette
glanced
toward
the
door
into
the
hall
rather
anxiously
if
you
will
permit
me
to
come
into
your
room
i
will
answer
you
moira
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
indicated
the
door
by
which
she
had
entered
piquette
preceded
her
into
the
room
as
moira
stood
by
the
door
still
uncertain
but
curious
as
to
this
stranger
who
claimed
friendship
piquette
indicated
the
door
you
will
please
close
it
madame
she
urged
with
a
smile
i
am
quite
armless
and
moira
obeyed
catching
the
bolt
into
its
place
and
turning
with
an
air
very
little
mollified
who
are
you
she
demanded
shortly
answer
me
instead
of
replying
at
once
piquette
sank
into
a
chair
crossed
one
knee
over
the
other
and
leaned
forward
her
chin
on
her
fingers
staring
frankly
at
her
companion
you
are
andsome
madame
orton
she
murmured
as
though
grudgingly
ver
andsome
moira
flushed
a
little
and
returned
the
other
woman
s
look
a
sudden
suspicion
flashing
across
her
mind
that
this
who
are
you
she
stammered
am
madame
i
am
called
piquette
said
the
visitor
clearly
moira
recoiled
a
pace
her
back
as
flat
as
the
door
behind
her
piquette
morin
you
d
dare
quietly
madame
orton
said
piquette
gently
i
ave
tol
you
i
am

frien

madame
said
moira
in
a
choking
voice
and
pointing
to
the
door

but
piquette
did
not
move
ah

do
not
believe
me

moira
gasped
at
the
impudence
what
i
am
does
not
matter
but
what
you
and
jim
horton

does
i
wish
to

madame

you

perhaps
t
ink
it
a
proof
of

had
caught
the
girl

after

so
was
moira
piquette
s
purposeful
ambiguity
aroused
her
curiosity
and
she
turned
toward
the
french
girl
her
glance
passing
over
her
with
a
new
interest
i
don
t
understand
you
madame
she
said
coldly

faintly

and
then
with
the
simplicity
of
a

madame
moira
stared
at

for
a
second
as

too
much

in

madame
like

piquette
stopped
and
then
gently
a
woman
like
me
madame
can
on
y
worship
a
man
like
dat
moira
was
leaning
against
the
bed
rail
her
head
bent
her
eyes
searching
out
piquette
s
very
soul
and
you
madame
said
piquette
her
voice
gathering
scorn
in
its
very
suppression
you

madame
no

love
of
a
man
like
jeem
orton

you
do
not
know
what
love
is
stop
madame
gasped
moira
her
lips
gray
and
trembling
under
the
wrist
that
masked
her
eyes
you
dare
not
tell
me
what
love
is
you
don
t
yes
said
piquette
quietly
i
know
everyt
ing
but
only
god
could
keep
me
from
de
man
i
love
yes
god
whispered
moira
tensely
only
god
the
pallor
of
her
face
the
agonized
clutch
of
her
white
fingers
on
the
table
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
silenced
piquette
and
she
glanced
up
at
moira
partly
in
pity
partly
in
scorn
piquette
s
education
had
not
fitted
her
to
understand
the
motives
of
women
different
from
herself
but
she
saw
in
moira
s
face
the
scars
of
a
great
passion
and
the
marks
of
suffering
not
to
be
denied
and
so
after
a
painful
moment
for
moira
she
turned
her
glance
aside
i
can
not
speak
of
this
to
you
madame
she
heard
the
girl
stammer
you
have
no
right
to
judge
me
or
to
question
my
motives
and
if
i
ve
misjudged
jim
horton
god
knows
i
m
sorry
for
it
but
should
come
and
tell
me
these
things
moira
s
breath
seemed
suspended
while
she
waited
for
the
woman
s
answer
piquette
traced
for
a
moment
with
her
finger
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
you
may
be
sure
it
as
cos
me
somet
ing
she
said
slowly
does
he
jim
horton
know
no
madame
he
knows
noding
then
because
said
piquette
rising
with
some
dignity
because
it
pleases
me
madame
what
jeem
orton
wish
my
wish
too
e
love
you
what
e
is
to
me
does
not
matter
moira
stared
at
her
dully
she
could
not
believe
if
you
do
not
on
erstan
me
madame
piquette
continued
it
is
because
you
do
not
wish
to
on
erstan
because
all
de
sacrifice
e
make
for
you
is
in
vain
you
listen
to
deir
lies
become
a
partner
in
a
crime
to
get
money
which
does
not
belong
to
how
do
you
know
this
arry
me
de
trut
harry
yes
madame
i
was
a
frien
to
your
usband
the
glances
of
the
two
women
met
held
each
each
other
omitting
nothing
it
was
piquette
who
looked
away
if
was
to
be
the
measure
of
her
sacrifice
she
had
neglected
nothing
an
now
she
said
quietly
if
you
please
i
shall
go
away
not
yet
madame
said
moira
gently
not
until
i
tell
you
that
i
know
what
you
have
i
believe
what
you
have
said
thank
you
she
caught
piquette
by
the
hand
and
held
her
i
can
not
be
less
noble
than
you
madame
forgive
me
it
is
jeem
orton
who
should
forgive
i
have
done
him
a
great
you
and
i
must
do
him
another
great
wrong
you
have
said
that
only
god
could
keep
you
from
the
man
you
love
god

me
from
jim
horton
i
can
not
see
him
again
but
you
can
not
stay
here
madame
put
in
piquette
earnestly
no
perhaps
not
wearily
but
you
have
taught
me
something
if
sacrifice
is
the
test
that
love
exacts
like
you
i
can
bear
an
make
jeem
orton
suffer
cried
piquette
wildly
what
for
you
t
ink
i
tell
you
dese
t
ings
madame
you
mus
go
wit
im
to
paris
no
i
can
t
what
will

i
don
t
know

i
must
think
you
will
do
what
e
ask
of
you
no
you
mus
see
im
no
don
t
ask
me
there
was
a
knock
upon
the
door
into
the
quickly
the
two
women
exchanged
glances
moira
bewildered
piquette
dismayed
she
had
remained
too
long
monsieur
she
whispered
moira
a
finger
to
her
lips
beckoned
her
toward
the
door
into
nora
burke
s
room
when
there
was
another
quick
knock
and
quinlevin
entered
quickly
followed
by
another
figure
moira
why
didn
t
the
irishman
began
and
then
his
glance
passed
to
piquette
here
madame
he
frowned
with
quick
suspicion
glancing
toward
the
door
into
his
own
room
and
then
suddenly
beckoned
his
follower
in
it
was
monsieur
tricot
bent
hobbling
but
full
of
every
potentiality
for
evil
quinlevin
closed
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
putting
the
key
into
his
pocket
and
then
with
a
muttered
injunction
to
his
companion
unbolted
and
opened
the
door
into
his
own
room
and
disappeared
moira
had
scarcely
time
to
note
the
villainous
look
the
cast
in
piquette
s
direction
when
quinlevin
came
striding
in
like
a
demon
of
vengeance
ah
madame
morin
he
snapped
it
seems
as
though
i
were
just
in
time
what
have
ye
done
with
the
papers
the
little
patches
of
color
upon
piquette
s
lips
and
eyes
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
darker
in
the
pallor
of
her
face
for
tricot
s
evil
face
nearby
was
leering
at
her
tricot
whose
secrets
she
knew
and
whose
secrets
she
had
betrayed
she
was
horribly
frightened
but
she
managed
to
control
her
voice
as
she
replied
steadily
what
papers
monsieur
i
know
nothing
of
any
papers
the
papers
referring
to
the
de
vautrin
case
papers
moira
yer
birth
certificate
and
the
letters
which
went
with
it
moira
stood
near
the
door
into
nora
s
room
pale
but
composed
and
now
she
spoke
bravely
madame
morin
has
not
left
this
room
since
she
came
into
it
i
know
nothing
of
any
papers
piquette
smiled
inwardly
her
embassy
had
not
been
entirely
without
success
but
quinlevin
glanced
quickly
at
moira
suspicion
becoming
a
certainty
oh
we
ll
see
about
this
and
striding
quickly
to
nora
burke
s
door
locked
it
securely
and
then
to
piquette
ye
ll
please
accompany
me
into
my
room
madame
morin
he
said
dryly
perhaps
monsieur
tricot
and
i
can
find
a
way
to
unlock
yer
lips
piquette
cast
an
appealing
glance
at
moira
you
will
let
madame
morin
go
pleaded
the
girl
to
the
irishman
no
he
thundered
there
will
be
no
more
trickery
here
and
ye
ll
stay
here
lock
and
key
until
yer
new
friend
speaks
the
two
women
were
helpless
and
they
knew
it
already
tricot
s
sharp
talons
had
closed
on
piquette
s
shoulder
but
with
an
effort
at
composure
she
shrugged
him
off
and
entered
the
door
beside
which
barry
quinlevin
stood
bowing
with
ironical
politeness
piquette
caught
just
one
glimpse
of
moira
s
white
face
before
the
door
closed
between
them
then
the
key
was
turned
in
the
lock
the
other
key
also
and
she
sank
rather
helplessly
into
a
chair
a
prisoner
this
locking
of
doors
is
a
game
that
two
persons
may
play
at
madame
said
quinlevin
easily
in
french
our
friend
the
deserter
locks
me
in
with
monsieur
de
vautrin
while
you
rifle
my
papers
and
now
i
keep
you
prisoner
until
they
are
found
where
are
they
madame
his
voice
was
soft
but
even
in
the
dim
light
iridescent
fires
played
forbiddingly
in
his
little
eyes
piquette
was
silent
her
glance
passing
about
the
obscurity
as
though
in
search
of
a
resting
place
she
feared
quinlevin
but
more
than
him
she
feared
the
evil
shape
just
beside
her
shoulder
she
could
not
see
tricot
but
she
felt
his
presence
the
evil
leer
at
his
lips
the
bent
shoulders
the
poise
of
his
head
and
the
vengeance
lust
burning
in
his
little
red
eyes
for
whatever
monsieur
quinlevin
owed
her
here
she
knew
was
her
real
enemy
the
papers
madame
quinlevin
repeated
more
brusquely
still
no
reply
you
took
them
from
behind
the
bracket
yonder
what
did
you
do
with
them
they
are
gone
she
said
quickly
where
that
i
shall
not
tell
you
she
felt
the
claws
of
tricot
close
upon
her
shoulder
until
she
shrank
with
the
pain
but
she
made
no
sound
one
moment
tricot
said
the
irishman
there
are
first
other
ways
of
making
madame
speak
release
her
tricot
obeyed
of
course
tricot
and
i
can
search
you
piquette
laughed
search
me
monsieur
it
is
your
privilege
i
am
not
squeamish
the
irishman
frowned
there
was
no
doubt
that
what
he
had
proposed
had
no
terrors
for
a
life
model
but
there
were
other
means
at
his
disposal
to
find
out
what
he
wished
to
know
i
should
have
remembered
your
m√©tier
madame
he
sneered
and
then
our
friend
tricot
has
a
long
memory
he
is
not
a
man
who
forgets
if
you
will
look
at
him
you
will
see
that
this
chance
meeting
is
much
to
his
liking
piquette
did
not
dare
to
look
it
seems
the
irishman
went
on
that
the
betrayal
of
the
secrets
of
the
small
society
to
which
you
belong
is
a
grave
offense
i
ve
betrayed
no
secrets
said
piquette
finding
her
voice
no
one
knows
of
the
affair
of
the
rue
except
monsieur
horton
who
will
tell
it
when
he
is
less
no
he
will
tell
tricot
is
not
willing
to
take
that
chance
eh
tricot
no
snapped
the
vulture
piquette
knows
the
penalty
she
ll
pay
it
and
if
i
pay
it
said
piquette
bravely
you
ll
know
no
more
about
what
has
become
of
your
papers
than
you
do
now
quinlevin
made
a
sign
to
tricot
there
s
something
in
i
m
in
no
mood
to
be
trifled
with
that
ought
to
be
pretty
clear
it
is
i
m
not
trifling
then
speak
quinlevin
paused
significantly
piquette
continued
to
glance
around
the
room
as
though
in
a
hope
that
something
might
happen
to
release
her
from
her
predicament
it
had
now
grown
dark
outside
but
her
captors
showed
no
disposition
to
make
a
light
and
yet
it
seemed
impossible
that
they
would
dare
she
tried
to
gain
time
and
if
i
could
tell
you
what
has
happened
to
the
papers
she
asked
uncertainly
will
you
let
me
go
and
if
i
can
not
tell
i
will
tell
you
madame
you
will
be
left
here
alone
in
this
room
with
the
good
tricot
and
as
piquette
shrank
down
into
her
chair
he
is
a
very
ingenious
rascal
tricot
never
yet
has
he
been
caught
by
the
police
quinlevin
stopped
suddenly
his
gaze
on
the
rectangle
of
the
open
window
as
though
listening
an
open
window
he
mumbled
i
left
it
but
do
you
go
tricot
and
look
out
perhaps
there
is
some
one
below
the
man
obeyed
without
a
sound
vanishing
outside
the
window
upon
the
small
portico
no
one
can
help
you
madame
quinlevin
said
in
a
threatening
whisper
for
at
my
word
tricot
shall
be
quick
and
silent
he
caught
piquette
furiously
by
the
wrist
and
twisted
it
what
have
you
done
with
my
property
he
asked
nothing
you
are
lying
tricot
s
silhouette
appeared
at
the
window
monsieur
he
whispered
tensely
there
s
a
horton
said
quinlevin
what
is
he
doing
crawling
in
the
bushes
monsieur
the
clutch
on
piquette
s
arm
grew
tighter
what
did
you
do
with
the
papers
i
burned
them
in
the
fireplace
she
said
desperately
quinlevin
rushed
to
the
hearth
and
struck
a
match
examining
the
ashes
minutely
then
he
straightened
quickly
you
lie
madame
i
burned
some
letters
here
this
morning
the
ashes
are
just
as
i
left
them
in
one
stride
he
was
at
her
side
again
a
pistol
in
his
hand
he
caught
her
roughly
by
the
arm
and
she
bit
her
lip
to
keep
from
crying
out
with
pain
he
is
down
there
what
did
you
do
with
the
papers
answer
me
let
me
go
no
what
will
you
do
unless
you
tell
me
the
him
from
the
window
you
would
not
she
whispered
in
spite
of
her
pain
the
people
of
the
investigate
the
bah
a
burglar
comes
along
the
portico
i
shoot
him
he
you
tell
the
truth
are
the
papers
in
this
room
i
won
t
tell
very
well
and
then
turning
to
his
companion
at
the
window
what
is
he
doing
now
tricot
he
does
not
the
irishman
released
piquette
suddenly
a
better
chance
for
a
shot
then
he
snapped
here
tricot
and
he
moved
toward
the
window
his
weapon
eloquent
piquette
sprang
up
despairingly
monsieur
she
cried
for
the
love
of
god
don
t
shoot
i
will
tell
i
thought
so
where
are
they
quick
he
had
her
by
the
wrists
now
one
on
each
side
and
tricot
s
skinny
hand
threatened
her
throat
threw
them
out
of
the
window
she
gasped
it
was
evident
that
at
last
in
her
terror
she
had
spoken
the
truth
with
an
oath
quinlevin
threw
her
aside
and
ran
to
the
window
while
tricot
twisted
her
arm
back
of
her
his
other
hand
at
her
throat
jeem
she
shrieked
in
a
last
despairing
effort
go
go
and
then
the
fingers
of
the
closed
and
the
sound
was
stifled
as
she
fell
back
in
a
chair
helpless
shut
up
damn
you
growled
quinlevin
keep
her
quiet
you
not
death
you
understand
we
may
need
her
piquette
heard
these
things
dimly
a
torrent
was
roaring
at
her
ears
and
her
eyeballs
seemed
to
be
starting
from
her
head
as
she
fought
for
her
breath
but
the
relentless
fingers
pressed
at
her
windpipe
and
you
monsieur
she
heard
tricot
ask
i
m
going
the
garden
if
she
speaks
the
truth
i
ll
find
it
out
dimly
she
heard
the
door
open
and
shut
and
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
while
she
fought
tricot
but
strong
as
she
was
she
knew
that
she
was
no
match
for
him
his
arms
were
like
steel
springs
his
fingers
like
iron
but
still
she
fought
trying
to
make
a
commotion
that
would
arouse
the
hotel
but
tricot
had
pinioned
her
in
her
chair
and
even
the
dim
light
that
came
in
at
the
open
window
grew
black
before
her
eyes
she
struggled
again
at
the
very
verge
of
the
gate
of
oblivion
it
seemed
when
a
pain
sharper
than
that
at
her
throat
came
at
her
side
be
quiet
croaked
tricot
s
voice
at
her
or
i
and
she
obeyed
for
death
was
in
his
voice
and
in
his
hand
the
jim
horton
looked
at
his
watch
again
he
had
kept
the
visitors
in
the
apartment
of
monsieur
de
vautrin
more
than
an
hour
he
hurried
cautiously
down
the
stairs
toward
the
doors
of
the
rooms
occupied
by
quinlevin
s
party
there
was
no
one
in
sight
and
so
he
stole
along
the
corridor
listening
moira
and
nora
burke
had
entered
their
rooms
but
piquette
would
of
course
be
in
the
room
of
quinlevin
no
sound
and
so
he
waited
for
a
moment
in
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
hoping
at
any
moment
to
see
piquette
emerge
reassured
at
the
thought
that
the
irishman
at
least
had
probably
not
yet
come
up
but
the
suspense
and
inaction
weighed
upon
him
and
at
last
moving
quickly
he
went
down
the
back
stair
and
so
to
the
office
where
he
sought
out
the
friend
of
piquette
monsieur
jacquot
but
to
his
disappointment
he
found
that
the
man
had
gone
off
duty
for
the
night
and
was
probably
in
nice
quinlevin
he
discovered
had
been
seen
leaving
the
hotel
so
any
immediate
danger
from
him
was
not
to
be
expected
jim
horton
was
plagued
with
uncertainty
if
piquette
had
already
succeeded
in
her
mission
he
couldn
t
understand
why
she
hadn
t
returned
to
her
room
perhaps
he
had
missed
her
on
the
way
she
might
have
used
the
main
though
under
the
circumstances
this
would
not
have
been
probable
during
the
day
he
had
managed
to
take
a
surreptitious
survey
of
the
rear
of
the
hotel
where
the
quinlevin
suite
was
situated
and
it
was
only
piquette
s
suggestion
to
keep
the
irishman
busy
while
she
searched
his
room
that
had
dissuaded
horton
from
an
attempt
to
reach
quinlevin
s
room
from
the
outside
there
was
a
small
portico
at
the
irishman
s
windows
which
it
seemed
possibly
could
be
reached
by
climbing
a
wooden
trellis
and
a
small
projecting
roof
of
an
where
a
rain
spout
rose
alongside
a
shutter
which
offered
a
good
hand
of
a
venture
at
night
but
a
chance
if
everything
else
failed
he
was
sure
now
that
he
had
missed
piquette
on
the
way
and
if
she
had
been
successful
she
was
by
this
time
safe
in
her
room
with
the
doors
securely
bolted
and
a
at
hand
by
means
of
which
if
molested
she
could
summon
the
servants
of
the
hotel
and
quinlevin
would
hardly
dare
to
try
that
because
an
investigation
meant
the
police
and
the
police
meant
thing
to
be
dreaded
at
this
time
with
the
battle
going
against
him
nor
did
horton
wish
to
make
a
row
for
piquette
was
a
discovery
meant
placing
her
in
an
awkward
position
which
would
take
some
explaining
monsieur
jacquot
would
have
been
a
help
but
there
was
no
hope
of
trying
to
use
him
to
intimidate
quinlevin
even
had
the
frenchman
been
willing
to
take
a
share
in
so
grave
a
responsibility
so
jim
horton
waited
for
awhile
lurking
in
the
shadows
of
a
small
corridor
near
the
office
watching
the
entrance
of
the
hotel
for
the
irishman
s
return
and
was
just
about
to
go
out
of
the
rear
door
into
the
garden
for
a
little
investigation
of
his
own
when
he
heard
the
sounds
of
voices
near
the
office
and
saw
monsieur
de
vautrin
dressed
for
travel
talking
to
the
horton
paused
behind
a
column
to
watch
and
listen
the
duc
s
flushed
face
and
gay
mien
proclaiming
the
triumph
he
had
experienced
and
while
he
had
packed
his
clothing
no
doubt
a
short
session
with
the
this
was
monsieur
de
vautrin
s
incognito
this
his
silent
departure
from
the
shades
of
his
beloved
monte
carlo
the
man
was
a
fatuous
dotard
not
worth
the
pains
that
had
been
wasted
upon
him
his
account
paid
monsieur
de
vautrin
walked
toward
the
door
where
an
automobile
awaited
him
but
as
he
was
about
to
get
into
the
machine
a
tall
figure
emerged
from
the
darkness
and
stood
beside
him
a
passage
of
words
between
the
two
men
and
the
duc
laughed
a
great
game
monsieur
the
irishman
horton
heard
him
say
but
you
have
lost
in
a
week
i
shall
be
again
in
paris
in
the
hands
of
my
avocat
and
quinlevin
shrugged
and
de
vautrin
got
into
the
machine
which
dashed
off
into
the
darkness
leaving
the
irishman
standing
uncertainly
upon
the
step
it
was
not
until
then
that
horton
noticed
that
he
had
a
companion
for
at
that
moment
two
figures
emerged
into
the
light
and
horton
knew
that
quinlevin
s
forces
had
been
augmented
by
one
for
monsieur
tricot
had
arrived
the
two
men
came
in
hurriedly
as
though
having
reached
a
decision
and
went
up
the
stairs
there
ll
be
the
devil
to
pay
if
piquette
has
succeeded
muttered
horton
to
himself
and
then
in
a
quick
afterthought
and
maybe
a
worse
she
hasn
t
he
waited
until
they
had
gone
beyond
the
landing
and
then
hurried
to
the
rear
stairway
and
up
the
two
flights
to
the
door
of
piquette
s
at
his
discovery
she
was
not
there
nor
had
she
been
there
for
he
struck
a
match
and
found
its
condition
precisely
that
in
which
he
had
left
it
half
an
hour
before
he
waited
for
a
few
moments
then
turned
the
corner
of
the
corridor
and
went
quickly
toward
quinlevin
s
door
waiting
for
a
moment
and
listening
intently
he
made
out
the
murmur
of
voices
a
man
s
and
a
woman
s
but
he
could
not
hear
it
distinctly
but
that
the
man
s
voice
was
the
irishman
s
he
did
not
doubt
nor
that
the
woman
s
was
piquette
s
cautiously
he
turned
the
knob
of
the
door
it
was
locked
quinlevin
evidently
expected
him
there
was
no
chance
of
ingress
here
unless
quinlevin
permitted
it
the
irishman
had
the
law
on
his
side
if
horton
persisted
quinlevin
could
shoot
him
which
was
what
he
wished
to
do
with
every
prospect
of
acquittal
in
any
trouble
that
might
follow
horton
waited
here
only
a
moment
and
then
ran
quickly
down
the
stairs
past
some
guests
on
their
way
to
the
casino
and
out
into
the
garden
at
this
hour
of
the
night
it
was
dark
for
the
dining
rooms
were
upon
the
other
side
and
the
smoking
and
billiard
rooms
were
deserted
glancing
toward
the
promenade
just
beyond
the
hedge
he
stole
along
the
walls
of
the
hotel
beneath
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
using
the
deeper
shadows
until
he
reached
a
palm
tree
from
the
shelter
of
which
he
carefully
scrutinized
the
fa√ßade
of
the
building
identifying
the
windows
and
portico
of
the
room
of
quinlevin
then
went
nearer
to
a
clump
of
bushes
beneath
the
portico
where
he
crouched
to
listen
for
any
sounds
that
might
come
from
above
silence
except
for
the
distant
murmuring
of
the
surf
among
the
rocks
below
the
casino
he
tried
to
believe
that
the
voice
he
had
heard
through
the
door
upstairs
was
not
piquette
it
might
have
been
moira
s
or
nora
burke
s
but
if
it
was
not
piquette
s
voice
then
where
was
she
and
why
had
she
stayed
so
long
venturing
quinlevin
s
wrath
at
her
intrusion
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
that
she
had
overstayed
the
allotted
time
and
that
now
they
had
come
in
upon
irishman
and
the
rascal
tricot
she
was
in
for
a
bad
half
something
worse
but
horton
reassured
himself
with
the
thought
that
quinlevin
desired
to
keep
the
tale
of
his
hazard
of
new
fortune
a
secret
they
would
not
dare
to
do
physical
harm
to
piquette
in
a
hotel
which
had
its
name
for
respectability
they
would
not
dare
to
risk
her
outcries
which
if
damaging
to
herself
would
be
doubly
damaging
to
barry
quinlevin
so
horton
crouched
in
the
center
of
his
hiding
place
and
uncertainly
waited
sure
that
if
she
was
in
danger
his
place
was
now
beside
piquette
who
had
played
a
game
with
death
for
him
in
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
he
glanced
up
at
the
trellis
just
beside
him
planning
the
ascent
and
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
a
small
object
hanging
among
the
twigs
just
above
his
head
it
was
within
reach
of
his
hand
and
he
took
letter
or
a
slip
of
paper
somewhat
rumpled
he
fingered
and
then
looked
at
it
but
it
was
too
dark
to
see
near
him
upon
the
turf
was
another
square
of
a
letter
further
off
another
and
another
hanging
in
the
opposite
side
of
the
bush
in
his
hands
idly
he
fingered
the
letter
the
paper
was
fine
and
it
bore
an
embossed
heading
or
crest
he
was
about
to
throw
it
aside
when
he
looked
up
the
wall
of
the
building
at
the
portico
outside
barry
quinlevin
s
with
a
sudden
sense
of
his
discovery
that
these
papers
had
fallen
from
the
windows
of
the
second
floor
or
those
of
the
s
of
course
they
were
yet
he
started
to
his
feet
and
looked
around
elsewhere
so
far
as
he
could
see
the
garden
was
scrupulously
neat
the
pride
of
a
gardener
who
was
well
paid
to
keep
up
the
traditions
of
this
fairyland
horton
bent
over
searching
and
found
another
paper
even
more
rumpled
than
the
others
he
glanced
up
at
the
windows
on
the
third
floor
there
was
no
sign
of
occupancy
for
though
one
of
the
windows
was
open
both
were
still
dark
but
he
waited
a
moment
listening
and
fancied
that
he
heard
the
low
murmur
of
voices
then
a
dull
glow
as
though
some
one
had
made
a
light
for
a
cigarette
but
the
papers
in
his
fingers
he
realized
with
a
growing
excitement
that
they
were
quite
dry
to
the
touch
and
had
not
therefore
been
long
exposed
to
the
damp
sea
air
had
piquette
not
daring
to
strike
a
light
he
turned
and
crept
quickly
back
to
the
light
of
the
hall
way
and
here
behind
the
door
he
read
the
papers
quickly
their
meaning
flashed
through
his
consciousness
with
a
letter
from
monsieur
de
vautrin
a
receipt
for
money
and
the
crumpled
paper
a
square
printed
document
bearing
the
now
familiar
name
of
patricia
madeleine
aulnoy
de
birth
certificate
upon
which
all
barry
quinlevin
s
fortunes
moira
s
he
could
not
take
time
to
investigate
the
characters
of
the
handwriting
for
the
light
was
dim
and
the
real
significance
of
his
discovery
was
not
to
be
denied
no
one
but
piquette
would
have
thrown
such
papers
out
of
the
window
into
the
garden
nor
would
she
have
done
so
desperate
a
thing
unless
she
had
found
herself
at
bay
with
no
other
means
of
disposing
of
them
he
reasoned
this
out
for
himself
while
he
thrust
the
documents
safely
into
an
inner
pocket
and
crept
quickly
back
to
his
place
beneath
the
windows
searching
as
he
went
upon
the
ground
for
any
other
papers
that
might
have
escaped
him
there
was
no
time
to
spare
piquette
was
up
there
he
was
sure
of
it
now
otherwise
why
hadn
t
she
escaped
and
run
down
to
recover
the
documents
before
quinlevin
s
return
with
tricot
but
why
had
she
thrown
them
from
the
window
unless
their
presence
threatened
these
and
other
speculations
were
to
remain
unanswered
for
if
piquette
were
in
that
room
alone
with
the
two
men
her
danger
was
great
there
was
a
slight
sound
from
above
he
peered
upward
in
silhouette
against
the
sky
was
the
figure
of
a
couldn
t
tell
whether
tricot
or
the
irishman
it
was
to
be
a
desperate
game
then
they
had
just
guessed
what
piquette
had
done
with
the
birth
certificate
and
there
seemed
not
the
slightest
hope
that
the
man
on
the
portico
could
have
failed
to
see
his
figure
below
the
thin
screen
of
winter
foliage
desperate
yes
but
worth
piquette
he
owed
it
to
her
and
as
in
moments
of
great
danger
he
found
himself
suddenly
cold
with
purpose
and
thinking
with
extraordinary
lucidity
quinlevin
would
not
dare
to
shoot
him
out
of
hand
without
a
cause
but
to
catch
a
man
climbing
the
wall
of
his
hotel
into
the
window
of
his
room
would
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
an
obvious
act
of
and
yet
had
quinlevin
considered
the
possibility
of
horton
s
attempting
so
dangerous
a
climb
if
not
the
element
of
surprise
might
be
in
jim
horton
s
favor
but
there
was
to
be
no
choice
for
as
he
stood
measuring
the
height
of
the
trellis
from
the
window
above
he
heard
a
stifled
voice
crying
his
name
jeem
it
called
go
go
he
ran
to
the
trellis
and
climbed
it
easily
putting
his
revolver
in
an
outer
pocket
as
he
reached
the
friendly
roof
of
the
little
outbuilding
crouching
behind
a
projection
of
the
wing
and
gazing
upward
for
a
further
sight
of
monsieur
tricot
he
thought
he
heard
sounds
now
the
creaking
of
furniture
and
the
growl
of
a
masculine
voice
other
sounds
more
terrible
more
significant
they
were
choking
her
them
cowards
scorning
further
secrecy
he
measured
with
his
eye
the
distance
he
would
have
to
spring
for
a
hand
hold
on
the
of
the
window
above
him
the
his
main
hope
upon
investigation
proving
unreliable
the
window
sill
which
was
his
objective
was
at
least
two
feet
above
his
outstretched
arms
and
to
the
left
beyond
the
edge
of
the
projection
on
which
he
stood
it
was
not
above
him
and
he
would
have
to
leap
sideways
from
the
roof
risking
a
drop
of
at
least
twenty
feet
to
the
menacing
stone
flagging
of
a
path
which
led
to
the
kitchen
entrance
but
he
leaped
upward
and
out
into
the
dark
his
fingers
clutching
swinging
for
a
second
above
vacancy
and
then
hauled
himself
up
until
he
got
a
hand
hold
on
the
hinge
of
the
open
shutter
then
a
knee
on
the
sill
pushing
the
french
window
which
yielded
to
his
touch
he
hoped
the
room
was
unoccupied
but
had
no
time
to
consider
that
possibility
straightening
and
climbing
the
shutter
quinlevin
s
portico
was
within
his
reach
now
he
waited
cautiously
for
a
second
listening
and
peering
upward
no
sign
of
any
one
outside
but
the
sounds
within
he
heard
them
again
horribly
suppressed
he
caught
the
edge
of
the
portico
and
swung
himself
up
close
to
the
wall
of
the
building
and
in
a
moment
had
gained
a
safe
within
the
railing
there
was
no
light
within
the
room
and
now
no
sound
had
they
in
the
brief
moment
he
paused
gasping
for
his
breath
he
was
aware
of
a
figure
below
moving
cautiously
along
the
outskirts
of
the
garden
he
crouched
below
the
balustrade
instinctively
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
the
cautious
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
emerged
from
the
french
window
to
peer
over
it
was
tricot
like
a
cat
horton
sprang
for
him
and
the
impact
of
the
shock
sent
them
both
sprawling
half
in
half
out
of
the
room
neither
made
a
sound
each
aware
of
the
hazard
of
his
situation
horton
struck
and
struck
again
felt
the
sharp
scratch
of
monsieur
tricot
s
knife
upon
his
shoulder
and
caught
the
wrist
of
the
hand
that
held
it
twisting
twisting
until
the
weapon
dropped
clattering
just
within
the
door
of
the
room
but
the
frenchman
was
strong
and
struggled
upward
kicking
biting
until
horton
with
his
right
arm
free
struck
him
under
the
jaw
that
took
some
of
the
fight
out
of
him
but
he
still
fought
gamely
while
horton
whose
blood
was
hot
now
wondered
why
quinlevin
hadn
t
joined
in
the
entertainment
tricot
in
desperation
tried
to
reach
for
another
weapon
with
the
arm
horton
hadn
t
pinioned
and
it
was
about
time
to
end
the
matter
a
memory
of
the
night
in
the
rue
charron
was
behind
horton
s
blow
which
struck
monsieur
tricot
neatly
behind
the
ear
and
sent
him
sprawling
out
on
the
portico
where
his
head
came
into
contact
with
the
cement
balustrade
and
he
fell
and
lay
silent
horton
took
no
chances
kicking
the
knife
a
cruel
affair
into
the
fireplace
and
appropriating
monsieur
tricot
s
revolver
which
he
put
into
the
other
pocket
of
his
coat
then
turned
to
look
for
quinlevin
he
didn
t
find
him
but
piquette
was
there
prone
in
the
arm
chair
and
gasping
horribly
for
her
breath
piquette
it
s
jim
he
whispered
her
swollen
tongue
refused
her
but
her
fingers
clutched
his
hand
they
choked
you
piquette
she
managed
to
utter
painfully
i
ve
attended
to
him
where
s
quinlevin
she
pointed
soundless
toward
the
door
he
went
down
to
look
for
me
he
questioned
she
nodded
good
laughed
jim
we
ll
be
ready
when
he
comes
back
he
went
out
and
had
another
look
at
tricot
the
man
was
out
of
it
and
there
was
a
dark
shadow
on
the
stone
work
where
he
had
fallen
so
horton
came
back
into
the
room
found
a
pitcher
of
water
with
which
he
bathed
piquette
s
forehead
and
throat
and
then
gave
her
to
drink
and
in
a
moment
she
was
able
to
enunciate
more
clearly
but
she
was
very
weak
and
it
seemed
that
her
nerve
was
gone
for
her
shoulders
shook
with
hysteria
and
she
clung
to
horton
still
in
terror
of
her
frightful
experience
but
horton
was
taking
no
chances
now
and
did
the
thinking
and
talking
for
them
both
you
re
sure
quinlevin
went
down
to
look
for
me
he
asked
again
yes
tricot
e
saw
you
garden
he
knows
you
threw
out
the
papers
yes
into
de
garden
not
now
said
horton
in
my
pocket
you
found
dem
yes
it
s
what
ope
but
we
mustn
t
lose
them
again
now
piquette
after
all
this
is
the
door
locked
doan
know
horton
strode
to
the
door
and
turned
the
key
now
let
him
come
he
whispered
grimly
and
then
where
s
moira
he
asked
lock
in
er
you
saw
her
yes
jeem
but
she
must
have
heard
all
this
commotion
i
doan
know
um
he
paused
a
moment
glanced
at
the
door
into
the
corridor
and
then
crossed
quickly
to
the
door
piquette
indicated
knocking
softly
there
was
no
reply
moira
he
said
through
the
it
s
he
seemed
to
hear
sounds
within
a
gasp
a
movement
of
feet
and
then
silence
s
jim
there
was
no
sound
so
he
unbolted
the
door
and
turned
the
knob
it
was
locked
on
the
inside
a
gasp
from
piquette
who
had
been
listening
for
sounds
at
the
other
door
now
warned
him
to
be
quiet
and
he
straightened
there
were
footsteps
outside
and
then
a
knock
tricot
said
the
irishman
s
voice
let
me
in
quickly
whispered
horton
into
piquette
s
ear
in
the
chair
and
gasp
like
hell
she
understood
and
obeyed
him
horton
went
to
the
door
turned
the
key
and
barry
quinlevin
strode
in
he
s
gone
papers
so
was
quinlevin
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
a
wiry
arm
went
around
his
throat
from
behind
a
knee
in
the
middle
of
his
back
and
he
crumpled
backward
in
horton
s
strong
arms
down
to
the
floor
where
in
spite
of
his
struggles
horton
held
him
powerless
quickly
disarming
him
his
weight
on
the
astonished
irishman
s
chest
his
fingers
at
the
man
s
throat
gently
pressing
with
a
threat
of
greater
power
at
the
slightest
sound
the
achievement
was
ridiculously
easy
as
all
important
things
are
given
some
intelligence
and
a
will
to
do
quinlevin
at
this
point
had
come
to
realize
that
the
purely
psychological
stage
of
his
venture
had
passed
into
the
realm
of
the
physical
in
which
he
was
no
match
for
this
young
hercules
who
had
so
easily
mastered
him
and
tricot
outside
upon
the
balcony
was
a
shadow
that
had
not
been
there
before
the
game
was
up
and
so
he
resorted
to
diplomacy
which
was
indeed
the
only
thing
left
to
him
well
horton
he
uttered
ye
ve
won
not
yet
quinlevin
said
horton
grimly
and
then
to
piquette
who
had
stopped
gasping
and
already
showed
a
lively
interest
in
the
proceedings
the
sheets
from
the
bed
piquette
if
you
please
she
obeyed
and
helped
him
while
they
swathed
their
prisoner
from
head
to
foot
binding
and
gagging
him
with
his
own
cravats
and
other
articles
of
apparel
which
they
found
adaptable
to
the
purpose
and
then
between
them
lifted
him
to
the
bed
where
he
lay
a
helpless
clod
of
outraged
dignity
then
they
turned
their
attention
to
monsieur
tricot
who
as
they
dragged
him
by
the
heels
into
the
room
already
showed
signs
of
returning
consciousness
binding
him
first
reviving
him
afterward
of
the
two
tricot
was
now
the
least
quiescent
but
he
understood
the
touch
of
horton
s
revolver
at
his
temple
and
in
a
moment
lay
like
quinlevin
writhing
in
his
bonds
but
quite
as
helpless
and
now
quinlevin
said
horton
coolly
it
must
be
fairly
obvious
to
you
that
the
fraud
you
ve
practiced
at
the
expense
of
madame
horton
is
now
at
an
end
the
documents
upon
which
you
rely
are
in
my
pocket
where
they
will
remain
until
they
are
turned
over
to
monsieur
de
vautrin
in
the
morning
you
and
your
brave
companion
will
doubtless
be
released
by
the
servants
of
the
hotel
by
which
time
i
hope
to
be
in
another
part
of
france
he
stopped
with
a
shrug
at
the
sound
of
piquette
s
voice
we
mus
not
stay
too
long
jeem
orton
some
one
may
come
madame
horton
he
muttered
and
went
over
to
the
door
of
moira
s
room
and
listened
there
was
no
sound
moira
he
said
again
distinctly
through
the
keyhole
will
you
unbolt
the
door
a
small
sound
of
footsteps
moving
but
they
did
not
come
toward
the
door
moira
he
repeated
more
loudly
you
must
let
me
in
we
are
going
away
from
once
no
reply
it
is
as
i
suppose
jeem
orton
whispered
piquette
at
his
ear
she
does
not
wish
to
come
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
i
saw
her
jeem
she
whispered
i

opeless

do

he
muttered
incredulously
not
of

returned
piquette
of
i
don
t
piquette
shrugged
try
again
den
jeem
orton
he
no
avail
there
was
now
no
sound
from
within
in
reply
to
his
more
earnest
entreaties
something
must
have
happened
to
her
he
mumbled
straightening
with
a
glance
toward
the
bed
if
i
but
no
piquette
broke
in
quickly
not
ing
as
appen
to
er
jeem
she
is
quite
safe
i
m
not
so
sure
about
and
putting
his
weight
against
the
door
he
tried
to
force
it
in
it
yielded
a
trifle
but
the
slender
bolt
held
he
waited
a
moment
listening
again
silencing
piquette
s
whispered
protestations
at
the
commotion
he
was
creating
but
heard
nothing
then
moving
away
a
few
paces
he
pushed
the
door
with
his
full
weight
and
it
flew
open
with
a
crash
almost
throwing
him
to
the
floor
the
room
was
empty
but
the
unlocked
door
leading
into
nora
burke
s
room
showed
which
way
she
had
gone
he
went
in
and
looked
around
then
out
into
the
corridor
by
nora
s
door
there
were
some
people
at
the
other
end
of
the
corridor
but
moira
and
her
irish
nurse
had
disappeared
uncertainly
he
came
back
through
the
rooms
to
piquette
who
stood
in
moira
s
room
watching
the
prisoners
through
the
doorway
it
is
what
i

in

all
fin
er
an
i
piquette
will
elp
you
she
felt
his
arm
relax
and
knew
that
she
had
won
he
stared
for
a
long
moment
toward
the
open
door
into
nora
s
room
then
turned
with
a
quick
gasp
of
decision
you
re
right
piquette
we
ve
got
to
get
draw
his
claws
for
good
you
need
not
worry
e
will
not
urt
er
now
and
so
they
returned
to
the
irishman
s
room
and
looked
carefully
to
the
bonds
of
the
prisoners
nothing
was
disarranged
they
had
done
their
work
well
and
continued
it
by
methodically
making
all
arrangements
for
departure
shutting
the
french
window
putting
an
extra
turn
on
the
bindings
of
the
prostrate
men
who
glared
at
them
sullenly
in
the
obscurity
then
they
went
out
locking
all
three
rooms
from
the
outside
and
leaving
the
keys
in
the
doors
unobserved
they
went
up
to
their
their
belongings
descended
to
the
office
where
jim
coolly
paid
their
bills
and
went
out
into
the
night
there
was
a
garage
nearby
where
they
hired
a
car
paying
for
it
in
advance
and
in
less
than
twenty
minutes
jim
horton
driving
were
on
their
way
to
vingtimille
on
the
border
line
between
france
and
italy
there
they
left
the
machine
in
the
care
of
a
hotel
and
wrote
a
postcard
to
the
owner
of
the
garage
at
monte
carlo
telling
him
where
he
would
find
his
machine
this
message
they
knew
would
not
reach
him
until
some
time
the
next
day
by
which
time
they
would
be
lost
in
italy
meanwhile
destiny
was
at
her
loom
weaving
with
careless
hand
the
american
and
french
armies
were
moving
closer
to
the
rhine
but
the
infantry
regiment
to
which
harry
horton
belonged
lay
at
ch√¢teau
dix
awaiting
orders
there
harry
went
upon
the
morning
following
the
return
of
barry
quinlevin
from
ireland
upon
his
breast
he
wore
the
de
but
in
his
soul
was
a
deathly
sickness
the
inward
reflection
of
the
physical
discomfort
with
which
he
had
awakened
the
prospect
that
lay
before
him
was
not
to
his
liking
the
period
during
which
he
had
been
out
of
uniform
the
weeks
of
secrecy
of
and
abasement
had
marked
him
for
their
own
and
unfitted
him
for
the
rigorous
routine
of
discipline
that
awaited
him
and
so
he
faced
the
ordeal
with
a
positive
distaste
for
his
old
associations
aware
of
a
sinking
feeling
in
his
breast
that
was
not
entirely
the
result
of
his
heavy
potations
while
in
paris
he
felt
the
burden
of
his
failure
and
a
terror
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
live
up
to
the
record
jim
horton
had
made
for
him
there
would
be
no
more
fighting
perhaps
but
always
beside
him
there
would
stalk
the
specter
of
his
military
sin
of
which
the
medal
at
his
breast
was
to
be
the
perpetual
reminder
on
the
train
down
from
paris
the
medal
and
its
colorful
bit
of
green
and
red
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
range
of
his
vision
the
thing
he
tore
it
off
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
then
somewhat
relieved
sank
back
into
his
seat
and
tried
to
doze
but
his
nerves
were
most
uncertain
every
sound
even
the
smallest
seemed
to
beat
with
an
unpleasant
staccato
upon
his
ear
drums
and
he
started
up
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
trying
to
soothe
himself
with
tobacco
that
helped
but
he
knew
that
what
he
wanted
was
stronger
or
it
indeed
to
exorcise
the
demons
that
inhabited
him
and
the
thought
of
the
difficulties
that
would
lie
in
the
way
of
getting
what
he
craved
and
the
long
days
and
nights
that
were
to
follow
still
further
unmanned
him
before
moira
had
left
for
nice
he
had
given
her
his
promise
to
report
for
duty
fit
and
sober
and
he
had
put
his
will
to
the
task
aware
that
the
first
impression
he
created
with
his
colonel
was
to
be
important
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
did
not
dare
to
open
his
valise
and
touch
the
bottles
hidden
there
because
he
knew
that
one
drink
would
not
be
enough
to
sooth
either
his
nerves
or
the
dull
pangs
of
his
weary
conscience
that
he
had
a
conscience
he
had
discovered
in
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
when
the
desire
of
monsieur
tricot
and
to
put
jim
horton
out
of
the
way
for
good
had
brought
him
face
to
face
with
the
evil
image
of
himself
he
hated
his
brother
jim
as
much
as
ever
because
he
was
all
the
things
that
harry
was
not
but
the
plans
of
quinlevin
which
seemed
to
stop
at
nothing
not
even
moira
herself
now
filled
him
with
dread
and
repugnance
his
nerve
was
was
it
his
nerve
but
arrival
at
regimental
headquarters
restored
him
for
awhile
his
colonel
gave
him
a
soldierly
welcome
fingered
with
some
envy
the
de
which
harry
had
pinned
on
his
breast
again
before
leaving
the
railroad
and
summoned
harry
s
major
whose
greeting
left
nothing
to
be
desired
and
for
the
moment
it
almost
seemed
to
harry
as
though
he
might
be
able
to
put
it
over
but
the
next
day
was
difficult
he
managed
a
drink
early
and
that
kept
him
going
for
awhile
but
they
gave
him
his
company
in
the
morning
and
from
that
moment
the
intimate
contact
with
those
who
had
known
him
lieutenant
he
had
never
liked
a
sergeant
who
was
a
psychologist
and
a
familiar
face
here
and
there
associated
unpleasantly
with
the
long
weary
days
of
training
and
preparation
until
the
regiment
had
been
worked
up
into
the
advanced
position
but
his
long
sickness
in
the
hospital
and
his
unfamiliarity
with
recent
orders
served
him
well
for
excuse
and
the
de
upon
his
breast
served
him
better
a
corporal
and
a
sergeant
with
whom
in
the
old
days
he
had
had
nothing
in
common
each
of
whom
wore
decorations
came
up
to
him
saluting
and
reported
that
it
was
they
who
had
carried
him
back
to
the
dressing
station
from
the
rocks
at
boissi√®re
wood
he
shook
them
by
the
hands
with
a
cordiality
which
did
not
disguise
from
himself
the
new
terror
and
when
they
attempted
a
recital
of
the
events
of
the
great
fight
in
which
they
had
shared
he
blundered
helplessly
for
a
while
and
then
cut
the
interview
short
pleading
urgent
affairs
then
too
there
was
the
nasty
business
of
the
wounds
he
hadn
t
any
he
was
scathless
he
had
tried
the
ruse
of
the
adhesive
tape
on
moira
with
disastrous
effect
here
the
result
of
the
discovery
of
his
unblemished
skin
would
prove
still
more
disastrous
and
so
at
once
he
discouraged
familiarity
kept
to
his
billet
and
attempted
with
all
the
courage
left
to
him
to
put
through
his
daily
round
with
all
credit
to
his
new
office
but
it
irked
him
horribly
his
supply
of
strong
drink
did
not
last
long
and
the
thin
red
wines
the
only
substitute
procurable
were
merely
a
source
of
irritation
and
there
were
others
in
his
company
of
whose
approbation
he
was
not
at
all
certain
there
was
the
sergeant
who
had
had
the
platoon
that
had
been
caught
with
his
own
in
the
there
were
four
or
five
men
of
one
of
his
own
squads
who
had
been
close
beside
him
in
the
same
when
he
had
been
taken
ill
and
they
had
left
him
face
to
face
with
the
grinning
head
of
the
hated
levinski
and
there
was
the
late
levinski
s
own
buddy
weyl
who
had
sometimes
shared
in
harry
s
reprobation
weyl
annoyed
him
most
perhaps
with
his
staring
fishy
eye
and
his
hebraic
nose
so
similar
to
that
of
his
lamented
weyl
had
been
in
the
wheatfield
and
his
heavy
face
seemed
to
conceal
a
malevolent
omniscience
the
large
staring
eyes
followed
the
new
captain
of
infantry
inquisitive
accusing
and
contemptuous
whenever
corporal
weyl
came
within
the
range
of
harry
s
vision
their
glances
seemed
at
once
to
meet
and
hold
each
other
and
it
was
the
captain
who
always
looked
away
weyl
s
fishy
eye
fascinated
and
haunted
him
he
saw
it
by
day
dreamed
of
it
by
night
and
he
cursed
the
man
in
his
heart
with
a
fury
that
did
nothing
for
his
composure
one
day
as
harry
was
making
his
way
to
mess
he
came
upon
corporal
weyl
standing
at
ease
just
outside
his
billet
the
man
s
eye
seemed
more
round
more
fishy
and
his
demeanor
more
contemptuous
than
ever
the
last
of
the
whisky
was
gone
harry
horton
s
heart
was
behaving
queerly
within
him
and
muscles
with
which
he
was
unfamiliar
announced
their
existence
in
strange
twitchings
the
breakfast
coffee
would
help
in
the
glared
at
corporal
weyl
his
fists
clenched
what
the
do
you
mean
by
staring
at
me
all
the
time
he
asked
weyl
came
to
attention
and
saluted
in
excellent
form
i
beg
pardon
sir
i
don
t
understand
he
said
why
the
do
you
stare
at
me
i
didn
t
know
that
i
did
stare
sir
yes
you
did
cut
it
out
it
annoys
me
but
corporal
weyl
still
stared
as
the
regulations
demand
looking
his
captain
squarely
in
the
eye
and
the
captain
s
gaze
wavered
and
fell
when
i
m
about
he
ordered
you
look
some
other
way
understand
yes
sir
i
understand
said
weyl
saluting
again
as
harry
turned
away
but
still
staring
at
him
and
harry
felt
the
fishy
stare
more
than
ever
omniscient
more
than
ever
contemptuous
in
the
middle
of
his
back
all
the
way
down
the
road
to
mess
but
he
had
just
enough
of
self
control
to
refrain
from
looking
around
at
the
object
of
his
fury
and
at
mess
a
disagreeable
surprise
awaited
him
in
the
person
of
a
medico
who
had
just
joined
the
outfit
the
new
captain
had
barely
finished
his
coffee
when
he
found
himself
addressed
by
the
officer
a
major
who
sat
just
opposite
him
at
table
how
are
you
captain
horton
asked
the
man
cordially
extending
a
hand
across
didn
t
recognize
you
at
first
how
s
the
head
harry
stammered
something
i
m
after
you
down
at
neuilly
you
know
oh
yes
said
harry
of
course
glad
to
see
you
again
major
things
were
a
bit
hazy
down
there
eh
yes
rather
said
harry
delicate
operation
that
touch
and
go
for
awhile
but
you
came
through
all
delusions
thought
you
were
another
oh
yes
said
harry
faintly
but
i
m
all
right
glad
to
hear
it
how
s
the
head
fine
no
more
delusions
no
sir
i
d
like
to
have
a
squint
at
the
wound
presently
if
you
don
t
mind
interesting
case
very
harry
rose
suddenly
his
face
the
color
of
ashes
sorry
sir
he
muttered
i
ve
got
a
lot
to
do
now
later
perhaps
and
then
without
a
word
took
up
his
cap
and
fled
incontinently
from
the
room
there
were
but
two
other
officers
present
but
they
stared
at
him
as
he
went
out
for
the
conversation
across
the
table
had
drawn
attention
remarked
the
major
into
his
surly
chap
that
considering
i
saved
his
de
i
see
yes
sir
said
a
lieutenant
just
joined
up
worried
maybe
not
much
worried
about
me
apparently
said
the
major
harry
went
straight
out
to
his
billet
locked
the
door
of
his
soom
and
sank
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
the
situation
was
horrible
this
man
of
all
men
who
had
seen
jim
horton
through
the
hospital
suppose
out
of
professional
curiosity
the
fool
came
nosing
around
was
welby
now
with
the
regiment
harry
cursed
himself
for
the
hurry
of
his
departure
would
the
man
suspect
anything
hardly
but
harry
couldn
t
take
a
chance
like
that
again
a
second
refusal
of
the
major
s
request
would
surely
make
him
an
object
of
suspicion
and
the
wound
in
the
was
none
them
all
why
couldn
t
they
leave
him
alone
he
couldn
t
face
the
thing
out
it
was
too
dangerous
already
he
had
had
enough
of
it
and
yet
what
was
he
to
do
yesterday
he
had
thought
he
read
suspicion
of
him
in
other
men
s
eyes
they
seemed
to
strip
him
naked
those
hundreds
of
eyes
to
be
gazing
at
the
white
uninjured
flesh
where
his
wounds
should
have
been
all
this
in
a
week
what
was
to
happen
in
the
many
weeks
to
follow
if
this
fool
welby
had
come
why
wouldn
t
there
be
other
men
of
the
regiment
of
the
battalion
who
had
been
at
the
hospital
at
neuilly
also
they
would
catch
him
in
a
false
statement
force
him
into
a
position
from
which
he
could
not
extricate
himself
and
then
what
the
major
colonel
answer
could
he
give
them
if
they
asked
to
see
his
wounds
to
harry
s
overwrought
imagination
the
whole
army
seemed
joined
in
a
conspiracy
to
bring
about
his
ruin
to
go
about
his
work
seemed
impossible
but
to
feign
illness
meant
the
visit
of
a
doctor
perhaps
welby
himself
he
would
have
to
go
on
at
least
for
the
day
and
then
perhaps
he
would
think
up
a
transfer
to
some
other
unit
he
managed
to
put
through
the
day
still
wondering
why
men
looked
at
him
so
strangely
was
there
anything
the
matter
with
his
appearance
in
the
afternoon
the
youngest
of
his
lieutenants
approached
him
kindly
hadn
t
you
better
take
a
run
down
to
the
hospital
sir
he
asked
you
look
all
in
harry
stared
at
him
stupidly
for
a
moment
oh
i
m
all
little
stomach
the
youngster
saluted
and
disappeared
and
harry
went
back
to
his
quarters
there
was
no
wonder
that
he
looked
all
in
he
hadn
t
dared
to
go
to
the
mess
table
since
morning
and
he
hadn
t
had
a
drink
since
yesterday
tobacco
had
ceased
to
have
the
desired
effect
upon
his
nerves
he
felt
like
jumping
out
of
his
skin
the
thing
couldn
t
go
on
he
all
in
a
short
leave
of
absence
which
might
give
him
time
to
pull
himself
together
meant
being
gone
over
by
a
meant
showing
his
scarless
there
was
only
one
thing
to
quit
while
there
was
the
truth
came
out
the
more
he
thought
of
his
situation
the
more
clearly
this
course
seemed
indicated
to
disappear
the
night
it
could
be
when
he
didn
t
come
back
perhaps
they
would
think
that
the
wound
in
his
head
was
troubling
him
again
and
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
what
he
did
or
that
he
had
met
with
foul
play
they
could
think
anything
they
chose
so
long
as
they
didn
t
guess
the
truth
and
they
could
never
learn
the
truth
unless
they
examined
his
body
for
the
wounds
but
they
would
never
find
him
to
do
that
if
he
ever
got
safely
back
of
the
lines
he
had
managed
it
before
he
could
do
it
again
now
because
he
wouldn
t
have
to
trust
to
blind
luck
as
he
had
done
back
of
boissi√®re
wood
the
more
he
thought
of
his
plan
the
more
he
became
obsessed
with
it
at
any
rate
it
was
an
obsession
which
would
banish
the
other
obsession
of
the
watching
eyes
it
was
the
dark
he
craved
the
security
and
blessed
immunity
of
and
solitude
he
wouldn
t
wait
for
the
ordeal
of
the
morrow
and
so
driven
by
all
the
enemies
of
his
tortured
mind
and
planning
with
all
the
craft
of
a
guilty
conscience
he
arranged
all
things
to
suit
his
purpose
passing
beyond
the
village
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
visiting
a
friend
in
another
unit
and
then
losing
himself
in
the
thicket
he
traveled
afoot
all
night
using
his
map
and
making
for
the
railroad
at
couvreur
and
in
the
early
morning
breakfasted
at
a
farmhouse
telling
a
story
of
having
lost
his
way
and
craving
a
bed
for
a
few
hours
sleep
he
was
well
provided
with
money
and
his
host
was
hospitable
he
slept
a
while
awoke
and
no
one
being
about
searched
the
house
for
what
he
sought
he
found
it
in
a
wardrobe
suit
of
clothing
which
would
leaving
some
money
on
a
table
made
off
without
ceremony
into
the
thicket
covering
a
mile
or
so
in
a
hurry
across
country
when
he
found
a
disused
building
in
which
he
tore
off
his
uniform
and
donned
the
borrowed
clothing
leaving
his
own
including
its
de
under
a
truss
of
straw
it
grew
dark
again
but
he
did
not
care
in
a
village
he
managed
by
paying
well
to
find
a
bottle
of
cognac
his
cares
slipped
from
him
nothing
even
the
rain
his
soul
was
set
free
he
paid
for
a
good
lodging
and
slept
warm
inside
and
out
purchased
the
next
day
a
better
suit
of
clothing
and
then
boldly
boarded
a
train
for
paris
it
was
extraordinary
how
easily
his
liberty
had
been
accomplished
they
would
look
for
him
of
course
the
would
bustle
about
but
he
had
given
them
the
slip
all
right
and
they
would
never
find
him
in
paris
paris
for
awhile
and
then
a
new
land
where
no
questions
would
be
asked
curiously
enough
the
only
human
being
he
seemed
to
think
about
to
regret
in
what
he
had
done
was
moira
his
thoughts
continually
reverted
to
the
expression
on
her
face
the
night
that
jim
had
surprised
them
in
the
studio
its
agony
its
apprehension
so
nearly
depicted
the
very
terrors
that
had
been
in
his
own
soul
he
remembered
hazily
too
that
she
had
been
kind
to
him
when
quinlevin
had
left
him
there
to
watch
her
and
he
had
finished
the
bottle
of
irish
whisky
then
too
again
in
the
morning
she
had
awakened
him
and
started
him
upon
his
way
back
to
his
post
while
the
expression
of
her
face
had
shown
that
she
was
trying
to
do
her
duty
to
him
even
when
her
own
heart
was
breaking
she
had
had
a
thought
that
even
at
this
last
moment
he
still
had
an
opportunity
to
make
good
he
felt
that
moira
his
wife
in
name
only
would
know
the
pain
of
his
failure
quinlevin
would
sneer
jim
would
shrug
but
moira
would
weep
and
vain
he
had
cared
for
moira
in
his
strange
selfish
way
permitted
quinlevin
to
use
him
for
his
own
purposes
hoping
for
the
fortune
that
would
bring
ease
and
luxury
for
them
all
and
with
it
a
glamour
that
he
might
turn
to
his
own
account
and
win
the
girl
to
a
fulfillment
of
their
marriage
vows
but
jim
had
dashed
the
cup
from
his
lips
hero
like
himself
an
outcast
so
there
were
to
be
two
of
them
then
after
all
it
served
him
him
harry
horton
found
a
malicious
pleasure
in
the
situation
if
wasn
t
to
have
her
jim
shouldn
t
either
he
wasn
t
going
to
give
his
brother
the
pleasure
of
reading
death
notice
in
the
morning
paper
he
harry
horton
would
just
go
on
living
whatever
happened
and
he
knew
that
without
the
evidence
of
his
death
moira
would
never
marry
again
he
had
gathered
in
a
cloudy
way
the
general
meaning
of
the
visit
to
the
duc
de
vautrin
at
nice
and
had
wondered
at
moira
s
consent
to
go
with
quinlevin
on
such
a
mission
after
what
she
must
have
heard
that
night
but
he
had
been
in
no
humor
to
ask
questions
the
next
morning
and
knew
nothing
whatever
as
to
the
prospects
of
success
for
the
undertaking
it
looked
very
much
as
though
with
jim
horton
in
on
the
game
the
mission
was
dubious
and
yet
quinlevin
might
succeed
if
he
did
there
would
be
enough
money
to
stake
harry
in
a
new
life
in
some
distant
part
of
the
world
this
was
the
price
that
they
would
pay
for
harry
would
go
he
knew
now
that
moira
was
not
for
him
she
had
settled
that
matter
definitely
the
night
when
he
had
come
in
drunk
from
the
rue
charron
he
reached
paris
and
lost
himself
in
montmartre
avoiding
the
old
haunts
there
he
found
new
acquaintances
and
many
bottles
to
soothe
the
awakening
pangs
many
bottles
moments
of
lucidity
how
long
would
it
be
before
moira
and
quinlevin
returned
to
the
rue
de
tavennes
he
would
have
to
sober
up
things
weren
t
bad
at
all
now
what
difference
did
it
make
to
any
one
but
himself
what
he
did
or
what
he
became
it
was
his
own
life
to
do
what
he
pleased
with
and
it
pleased
him
to
do
what
he
was
doing
with
it
he
laughed
at
the
amusing
inversion
good
joke
that
but
he
would
have
to
go
down
to
the
studio
in
the
rue
de
tavennes
and
talk
things
over
no
use
quarreling
with
quinlevin
everything
amiable
and
friendly
no
rue
de
tavennes
if
moira
wasn
t
there
he
d
go
in
and
wait
her
studio
his
too
perhaps
a
little
of
the
irish
whisky
and
a
doze
petit
the
road
to
paris
was
long
by
the
way
jim
horton
and
piquette
had
chosen
but
without
mishap
they
came
through
geneva
and
lyons
reaching
their
destination
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
of
the
further
adventures
of
monsieur
barry
quinlevin
and
his
apostle
tricot
they
had
learned
nothing
though
they
had
scanned
all
the
newspapers
upon
their
way
for
any
echoes
of
the
adventure
at
the
h√¥tel
de
paris
jim
horton
had
spoken
little
of
moira
but
as
they
neared
their
journey
s
end
the
birth
certificate
and
other
papers
still
secure
in
jim
s
inner
pocket
he
was
sure
that
however
difficult
and
painful
his
decision
to
desert
moira
at
the
critical
moment
piquette
s
counsel
had
been
wise
moira
had
fled
from
him
and
he
knew
now
that
her
convictions
had
laid
a
barrier
between
them
which
no
further
effort
that
he
could
make
would
ever
pass
pity
he
felt
for
her
deep
and
abiding
for
she
was
so
helpless
and
now
more
than
ever
alone
but
he
had
done
his
duty
as
he
had
seen
it
drawn
quinlevin
s
sting
and
opened
moira
s
eyes
to
his
perfidy
throwing
a
light
along
the
path
into
which
that
perfidy
was
leading
her
he
and
piquette
had
tried
to
picture
events
in
the
hotel
at
monte
carlo
after
their
flight
the
helpless
men
lying
in
the
dark
awaiting
the
morning
moira
s
probable
return
with
nora
burke
and
their
liberation
as
to
what
moira
would
do
after
that
they
could
not
decide
her
flight
to
paris
without
money
seemed
impossible
and
yet
for
her
to
remain
with
her
spurious
father
after
this
awakening
seemed
also
impossible
piquette
had
related
to
him
parts
of
her
conversation
with
the
girl
and
horton
had
listened
aware
of
piquette
s
motives
and
the
hopeless
impediments
to
the
success
of
her
efforts
piquette
spoke
no
more
of
love
nor
did
jim
horton
revive
the
topic
which
had
given
him
a
more
awkward
half
an
hour
than
he
had
ever
spent
in
his
life
but
he
showed
her
by
every
act
a
consideration
that
touched
her
deeply
and
made
the
friendship
that
she
asked
of
him
a
sacred
thing
to
them
both
what
the
future
held
for
him
was
yet
to
be
fully
revealed
but
as
yet
he
could
not
see
it
clearly
with
the
collapse
of
quinlevin
s
scheme
it
was
probable
that
all
the
vials
of
his
wrath
would
be
turned
upon
horton
who
would
be
denounced
to
the
military
authorities
no
matter
what
happened
to
his
unfortunate
brother
harry
it
was
necessary
therefore
until
the
birth
certificate
and
the
evidence
of
horton
and
piquette
was
all
placed
with
monsieur
de
vautrin
s
legal
representative
that
horton
remain
hidden
and
that
piquette
avoid
all
contact
with
her
friends
of
the
it
seemed
also
the
part
of
prudence
for
piquette
to
remain
for
awhile
away
from
her
apartment
keeping
in
touch
with
her
maid
who
would
bring
her
clothing
and
letters
to
a
designated
place
it
would
have
been
much
more
sensible
to
have
killed
tricot
laughed
horton
when
they
were
established
in
rooms
in
his
obscure
lodging
in
the
rue
jean
paul
he
ll
come
poking
about
with
a
brand
new
knife
and
revolver
and
then
we
ll
have
the
devil
to
pay
all
over
again
i
m
not
sure
said
piquette
we
ll
take
no
chances
and
when
this
business
is
finished
if
monsieur
de
vautrin
doesn
t
do
his
duty
by
you
i
d
like
to
take
you
away
from
paris
piquette
where
jeem
he
shrugged
to
america
where
else
but
she
shook
her
head
like
a
solemn
child
no
you
will
not
wish
to
be
taking
me
to
america
one
can
not
change
one
s
destiny
like
dat
you
s
all
not
ang

like
a
millstone
aroun
your

my
place

in
paris
where
i

de
is

sight
it
is
i
piquette
who
say
dis
to
you
he
glanced
at
her
curiously
aware
of
an
air
of
fatalism
in
her
words
and
manner
how
piquette
he
laughed
she
shrugged
i
doan
know
but
i
believe
you
s
all
be
appy
yet
with
her
you
mean
he
asked
not
a
chance
piquette
that
s
done
but
if
i
can
help
yes
you
s
all
elp
er
i
know
he
smiled
gently
and
then
thoughtfully
lighted
a
pipe
you
ve
got
cassandra
beaten
by
a
mile
my
little
piquette
cassandra
the
greatest
little
guesser
in
all
history
but
she
guessed
an
i
guess
right
too
you
see
he
smiled
then
i
wish
you
d
guess
what
s
happened
to
your
silly
friend
de
vautrin
silly
she
laughed
dat
s
a
good
word
and
then
shrugged
e
will
come
one
in
a
here
we
sit
cooling
our
heels
with
our
evidence
all
burning
in
our
fingers
if
he
doesn
t
arrive
i
m
going
to
find
his
they
had
examined
the
birth
certificate
with
a
magnifying
glass
and
there
was
not
a
doubt
that
the
final
a
of
patricia
had
been
added
to
patrice
also
that
the
word
male
had
been
changed
to
female
by
the
addition
of
the
prefix
with
nora
burke
as
quinlevin
s
only
witness
and
horton
and
piquette
to
oppose
her
there
would
not
be
the
slightest
difficulty
in
disposing
of
barry
quinlevin
s
pretensions
but
horton
still
worried
much
about
the
fate
of
moira
for
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
conceive
of
her
resumption
of
the
old
relations
with
the
irishman
and
yet
it
could
not
be
long
before
quinlevin
returned
to
paris
and
what
would
be
moira
s
fate
unless
she
accompanied
him
to
the
rue
de
tavennes
perhaps
she
was
there
now
already
four
days
had
elapsed
since
the
flight
from
the
riviera
and
of
course
there
had
been
ample
time
for
quinlevin
and
his
company
to
return
horton
wanted
to
go
to
the
rue
de
tavennes
and
try
to
learn
what
had
happened
but
piquette
advised
against
it
until
the
responsibility
for
the
papers
was
shifted
to
de
vautrin
she
did
not
think
it
wise
for
him
to
take
any
risk
of
danger
jim
horton
demurred
but
when
he
saw
how
much
in
earnest
she
was
he
consented
to
remain
in
hiding
a
few
days
longer
and
late
the
following
afternoon
monsieur
de
vautrin
not
yet
having
returned
and
while
they
still
waited
an
astonishing
thing
happened
for
piquette
s
maid
under
cover
of
nightfall
as
was
the
arrangement
brought
the
letters
from
the
boulevard
clichy
and
among
them
was
a
addressed
to
jim
horton
he
picked
it
up
gingerly
in
his
fingers
as
though
it
had
been
dynamite
and
curiously
scrutinized
the
envelope
it
augured
badly
for
his
security
in
paris
if
many
people
knew
so
readily
where
he
was
to
be
found
de
vautrin
he
tore
the
envelope
open
quickly
piquette
looking
over
his
shoulder
it
was
in
french
of
course
and
he
read
shall
be
alone
rue
de
tavennes
eight
forgive
and
don
t
fail
moira
he
read
the
lines
over
and
over
piquette
helping
him
to
translate
and
stood
a
moment
as
though
transfixed
by
its
significance
forgive
that
was
the
word
that
stood
out
in
black
letters
what
had
come
over
her
did
this
mean
that
driven
to
desperation
by
the
situation
in
which
she
had
found
herself
she
had
been
forced
against
her
will
to
plead
with
him
for
sanctuary
or
was
it
help
that
she
needed
whatever
the
real
meaning
of
the
message
there
was
no
doubt
in
jim
horton
s
mind
as
to
where
his
duty
lay
but
piquette
was
already
questioning
celeste
rapidly
when
did
this
arrive
not
an
hour
ago
madame
you
are
sure
yes
madame
positive
i
myself
received
it
from
the
messenger
very
well
celeste
you
will
return
to
the
apartment
and
if
any
other
message
arrives
be
sure
to
bring
it
at
once
yes
madame
and
be
sure
to
take
the
roundabout
way
and
be
sure
that
you
are
not
followed
yes
madame
when
the
woman
departed
piquette
took
the
blue
slip
from
jim
horton
s
fingers
and
sat
by
the
rereading
it
slowly
and
thoughtfully
i
must
go
of
course
piquette
said
jim
quietly
yes
you
mus
go
an
yet
there
are
some
t
ings
i
don

what
piquette
it
is
strange
dis

of
min
of
madame
orton
she
replied
she

said
jim
unaware
of
the
pain
he
caused
piquette
shrugged
i

she
said
dryly
but
to
ask
you
to
come
to

and
yet
she
has
done
de
character
of
madame

but
i
t

you

person
she
would

she
rose
and
handed
him
his
message

said
with
a
shrug
an
dere

not
much
time
but
wit
your
permission
she
added
firmly
i

he
stammered
dubiously
but
she
smiled
at
him
ah

but
madame
orton
and
i

er
too
an
where
could
she
go
onless
to
de
boulevard
clichy
jim
horton
stood
speechless
for
a
moment
and
then
slowly
i
hadn
t
thought
of
that
he
muttered
they
dined
and
then
piquette
went
to
her
room
to
put
on
her
hat
while
jim
horton
sat
watching
the
clock
which
ticked
off
the
minutes
before
their
departure
of
course
moira
s
appeal
for
forgiveness
was
only
the
weary
cry
of
a
heart
sick
with
cry
for
sanctuary
from
the
dreaded
evils
that
encompassed
her
but
he
would
not
permit
himself
to
believe
that
it
meant
any
new
happiness
for
him
except
the
mere
joy
that
he
would
find
in
doing
her
a
service
what
he
hoped
was
that
at
last
she
had
decided
to
permit
him
to
take
her
away
from
quinlevin
with
that
he
would
be
be
the
thing
that
separated
them
was
stronger
than
her
will
or
his
there
s
no
divorce
but
death
her
words
came
to
him
again
the
weary
tones
with
which
she
had
uttered
them
and
he
realized
again
that
there
was
no
hope
for
her
or
for
him
even
if
his
will
were
stronger
than
hers
he
must
not
use
it
to
coerce
her
when
piquette
joined
him
they
went
forth
by
a
circuitous
way
toward
the
rue
de
tavennes
to
be
certain
that
they
were
not
recognized
they
avoided
the
populous
streets
and
chose
narrow
shadowed
and
unfamiliar
their
coat
collars
turned
up
their
hats
pulled
well
down
over
their
eyes
while
horton
strode
beside
her
saying
nothing
to
see
moira
to
speak
to
her
to
take
her
away
from
the
rogue
who
had
for
so
long
held
her
in
his
thrall
as
they
turned
into
the
rue
de
tavennes
horton
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
some
moments
before
the
appointed
hour
under
a
gas
lamp
he
glanced
at
piquette
he
thought
that
she
seemed
pale
that
her
dark
eyes
burned
with
a
deeper
intensity
that
she
was
compact
of
suppressed
emotions
as
though
she
were
driven
forward
upon
her
feet
by
a
power
beyond
her
to
control
and
something
of
her
tenseness
seemed
curiously
communicated
to
him
was
it
that
piquette
knew
that
the
spell
that
bound
her
to
him
was
to
be
broken
that
the
strange
and
wonderful
friendship
that
she
had
found
was
to
be
dissipated
by
a
new
element
why
had
she
chosen
to
come
with
on
it
even
and
the
rapt
eager
absorbed
look
he
had
seen
upon
her
face
made
him
almost
ready
to
believe
that
she
had
in
her
something
of
the
seer
and
prophetess
at
which
he
had
been
pleased
to
jest
he
knew
that
she
was
game
physically
spiritually
and
that
she
could
walk
into
the
face
of
danger
and
suffering
to
do
him
a
service
it
almost
seemed
as
though
she
had
chosen
to
come
with
him
because
it
was
her
final
act
of
to
bring
jim
and
moira
help
the
woman
he
loved
to
security
if
not
to
happiness
as
they
neared
the
familiar
gate
of
madame
toupin
horton
was
conscious
of
a
sense
of
grave
responsibility
it
was
the
same
feeling
that
had
come
to
him
there
in
the
trench
before
the
advance
upon
boissi√®re
wood
the
imminence
of
great
events
the
splendid
possibilities
of
success
the
dire
consequences
of
failure
a
hazard
of
some
kind
with
happiness
or
misery
for
many
as
the
stake
at
the
corner
piquette
suddenly
caught
him
by
the
elbow
and
held
him
wait
she
whispered
wait
he
looked
down
at
her
in
surprise
at
the
sudden
pause
in
her
eager
footsteps
why
piquette
he
asked
don
know
jeem
she
muttered
breathlessly
one
hand
to
her
heart
i
don
ing
tell
me
to
do
you
want
to
go
back
he
asked
no
what
i
can
t
tell
you
jus
a
feeling
dat
you
should
not
go
i
am
not
but
i
don

she
laughed
ave
i
not

me
you
t
ink
i
am
foolish
but
it
is
ere
in
my
you

me
to

to
her
piquette
he
asked
yes
to
er
jeem
est
is
it
not
for
dat
which
i
come
she
hesitated
for
another
long
moment
jim
watching
her
and
then
raised
her
head
like
some
wild
creature
sniffing
at
the
breeze
she
said
we
shall
go
now
he
smiled
at
her
mood
and
they
went
on
piquette
making
no
further
protest
and
reached
the
gate
of
madame
toupin
where
they
paused
for
a
moment
the
was
dark
and
the
gate
was
open
this
was
unusual
but
horton
remembered
that
sometimes
madame
toupin
and
her
pretty
daughter
went
together
for
visits
in
the
neighborhood
two
men
were
chatting
under
the
lamp
in
the
but
so
absorbed
in
their
own
affair
that
they
gave
no
attention
to
the
visitors
who
entered
the
building
and
slowly
climbed
the
stairs
so
familiar
to
jim
and
so
suggestive
of
the
greatest
joy
and
the
greatest
misfortune
he
had
ever
known
piquette
followed
him
one
step
behind
clinging
to
the
tail
of
his
overcoat
they
met
no
one
a
light
showed
beyond
a
transom
on
the
second
floor
the
odor
of
a
cigarette
was
wafted
to
them
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
softly
singing
there
was
no
other
on
the
third
floor
but
moira
s
and
they
mounted
the
steps
softly
on
tiptoe
peering
upward
into
the
obscurity
for
signs
of
illumination
that
would
proclaim
occupancy
but
they
could
see
no
light
but
the
reflection
of
the
cold
starlit
sky
which
came
through
a
window
on
the
stair
and
outlined
the
rail
and
baluster
is
dere
no
light
asked
piquette
in
a
voice
which
in
spite
of
itself
seemed
no
more
than
a
whisper
i
can
t
see
any
yet
muttered
jim
and
then
as
his
head
came
in
line
with
the
floor
he
pointed
upward
above
the
door
the
transom
showed
ah
est
she
gasped
falling
into
her
native
tongue
unconsciously
silently
they
mounted
and
jim
knocked
upon
the
door
there
was
no
reply
he
knocked
more
loudly
silence
again
then
he
put
his
hand
on
the
knob
and
turned
it
the
door
yielded
and
they
entered
piquette
peering
curiously
over
his
shoulder
and
around
the
room
the
turned
low
cast
a
dim
light
over
the
room
the
corners
ware
bathed
in
shadow
and
horton
s
gaze
swept
them
eagerly
while
he
moved
here
and
there
the
familiar
chairs
the
couch
by
the
big
window
the
easel
with
its
canvas
the
draperies
the
lay
figure
seemed
to
be
all
as
when
he
had
seen
them
last
but
there
was
no
one
there
the
studio
was
empty
with
piquette
close
at
his
side
he
went
to
the
door
of
the
kitchenette
it
was
locked
and
the
key
was
in
the
door
it
had
been
fastened
from
the
studio
side
that
s
curious
muttered
jim
she
may
have
gone
out
for
a
moment
perhaps
said
piquette
jim
went
around
the
studio
glancing
at
the
windows
and
then
joined
his
companion
by
the
door
scrutinizing
his
watch
we
re
a
few
moments
early
piquette
he
muttered
i
will
go
down
and
ask
when
she
come
back
she
ventured
and
they
went
out
of
the
studio
closing
the
door
behind
them
but
jim
horton
hesitated
glancing
back
at
the
door
i
wonder
if
there
could
have
been
any
mistake
he
muttered
eight
o
clock
i
don
t
jeem
said
piquette
i
do
not
like
de
look
of
dis
i
am
she
peered
down
into
the
obscurity
suddenly
and
put
her
fingers
to
her
lips
some
one
is
coming
she
murmured
it
she
paused
listened
and
then
caught
him
by
the
arm
it
is
not
a
woman
is
a
man
listen
he
obeyed
catching
her
meaning
and
its
significance
quickly
the
footsteps
were
surely
not
those
of
a
woman
and
the
stairs
to
the
floor
below
creaked
heavily
a
man
who
he
muttered
it
is
what
i
fear
we
mus
the
door
of
the
jim
had
slept
in
was
near
them
tiptoeing
over
to
it
quickly
the
girl
behind
him
he
tried
the
knob
it
yielded
and
they
entered
its
darkness
leaving
the
door
wide
enough
open
so
that
they
could
look
out
the
man
was
now
climbing
up
the
stair
and
reached
the
landing
if
either
of
them
had
expected
to
see
barry
quinlevin
they
were
disappointed
for
the
figure
was
heavier
strangely
similar
to
jim
horton
s
and
like
him
wore
a
dark
overcoat
and
slouch
hat
and
while
they
peered
out
at
him
the
man
hesitated
looked
up
at
the
transom
and
then
turned
the
knob
and
entered
the
studio
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
jim
horton
had
felt
piquette
s
fingers
clutch
his
arm
and
questioned
in
a
whisper
what
is
it
piquette
your
arry
she
gasped
impossible
he
s
at
i
would
swear
in
civilian
clothes
he
knows
better
than
that
he
laughed
gently
you
re
nervous
it
s
arry
i
tell
you
she
insisted
i
am
not
mistake
it
did
look
like
i
doan
know
its
strange
what
i
t
but
why
should
harry
come
here
when
moira
sent
an
what
if
she
did
not
send
you
de
you
i
doan
that
harry
sent
it
why
would
he
want
to
meet
me
he
shrugged
but
it
s
queer
piquette
if
he
s
here
to
worry
her
again
i
ll
break
his
head
whispered
piquette
calming
him
she
mus
go
wit
me
he
nodded
but
she
isn
t
there
i
don
t
understand
we
mus
wait
ere
and
so
they
stood
at
the
door
listening
for
sounds
from
below
silence
and
then
a
strange
commotion
close
at
hand
suddenly
piquette
clutched
jim
s
arm
jeem
he
heard
her
whisper
in
sudden
terror
what
is
it
he
had
heard
the
same
thing
too
a
faint
sound
like
a
cough
followed
by
a
groan
as
though
some
one
were
struggling
for
breath
another
pause
while
they
listened
again
there
was
no
mistaking
it
now
jim
horton
had
heard
the
same
sounds
before
from
the
throat
of
one
of
the
engineers
who
had
been
horribly
gassed
another
groan
then
the
impact
of
a
heavy
body
falling
jim
horton
sprang
out
into
the
hallway
drawing
his
automatic
and
threw
himself
against
the
studio
door
it
was
locked
he
assaulted
it
again
again
and
at
last
the
tore
away
and
he
was
precipitated
into
the
middle
of
the
room
revolver
in
hand
glaring
about
him
piquette
close
beside
him
her
eyes
distended
with
horror
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
near
the
fireplace
lay
the
figure
of
a
man
quite
motionless
a
dark
blotch
growing
on
the
rug
beneath
his
body
and
the
distorted
face
turned
toward
the
feeble
light
of
the
flickering
was
that
of
his
came
from
piquette
in
an
awed
tone
e
as
kill
imself
but
jim
was
bending
over
the
body
impossible
a
knife
under
the
the
heart
it
s
murder
he
straightened
keenly
alert
and
searched
the
room
quickly
weapon
in
hand
thoroughly
aware
of
its
possibilities
for
concealment
a
chair
was
overturned
but
the
lay
figure
the
draperies
the
easel
were
undisturbed
and
the
door
into
the
kitchen
was
locked
key
on
the
as
before
the
thing
was
unbelievable
and
the
mystery
deepened
as
he
searched
moira
was
not
not
been
was
sure
of
it
now
this
trap
it
seemed
had
been
set
to
catch
jim
horton
and
knows
how
or
had
walked
into
it
as
piquette
bent
over
to
examine
the
dead
man
horton
hauled
her
away
quickly
he
had
just
wits
enough
left
to
know
how
dangerous
was
his
own
position
don
t
touch
is
a
case
for
the
police
come
and
he
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
to
the
second
floor
shouting
incoherently
for
help
while
piquette
her
tongue
loosened
now
ably
seconded
him
and
in
a
moment
it
seemed
the
entire
household
appeared
in
the
hallway
while
people
from
the
court
and
from
the
street
came
crowding
up
horton
who
knew
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
the
murderer
s
escape
by
the
window
stood
at
the
stair
on
the
second
floor
guarding
it
still
bewildered
by
the
mystery
trying
to
explain
while
the
crowd
surged
up
and
a
police
officer
who
had
been
passing
forced
his
way
through
to
him
piquette
gathering
her
courage
explained
telling
him
briefly
what
had
happened
while
they
had
watched
from
the
room
upstairs
the
police
officer
went
up
with
horton
and
piquette
and
entered
the
studio
the
crowd
following
to
the
door
where
the
policeman
commanded
them
to
stop
then
while
he
questioned
piquette
he
lighted
all
the
burners
and
examined
the
body
then
the
closet
the
windows
and
with
drawn
weapon
approached
the
door
to
the
kitchenette
it
was
still
locked
the
key
still
in
the
door
he
turned
the
locked
it
again
you
say
you
tried
this
door
when
you
the
room
he
asked
yes
monsieur
said
piquette
promptly
we
thought
that
madame
horton
might
be
inside
but
finding
it
locked
we
did
not
go
in
the
policeman
drew
back
muttering
most
extraordinary
he
said
there
is
a
door
from
these
other
rooms
into
the
hallway
outside
yes
the
policeman
pushed
a
way
through
the
crowd
and
tried
the
door
from
the
outside
it
too
was
locked
he
turned
to
the
crowd
no
one
came
out
of
this
door
no
one
no
one
monsieur
and
this
other
door
indicating
the
hall
room
there
was
no
one
there
said
a
man
who
seemed
much
at
home
one
of
us
went
in
when
we
came
up
the
stair
and
came
out
saying
it
was
empty
look
you
may
see
for
yourself
and
he
threw
the
door
open
while
the
officer
investigated
he
came
out
more
puzzled
than
ever
rejoining
horton
and
piquette
at
the
door
of
the
studio
summoning
the
man
and
one
or
two
of
the
others
with
horton
and
piquette
as
witnesses
taking
the
names
and
addresses
carefully
this
is
a
case
for
the
he
said
to
them
you
will
please
wait
the
sudden
extraordinary
turn
of
events
and
the
inexplicable
horror
of
his
brother
s
death
had
so
bewildered
jim
horton
that
he
stood
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
de
in
a
kind
of
stupefaction
looking
down
at
the
huddled
form
of
the
man
upon
the
floor
unable
to
think
with
any
clearness
the
officer
requested
him
not
to
move
or
touch
anything
and
piquette
stood
beside
jim
as
though
to
give
him
courage
but
the
policeman
kept
an
eye
on
horton
and
remained
by
the
door
watching
outside
and
in
as
though
guarding
it
against
his
possible
escape
horton
noticed
this
but
remained
immovable
aware
that
the
fellow
was
only
doing
his
duty
and
that
further
explanations
must
await
the
arrival
of
the
who
had
been
telephoned
for
the
furniture
of
the
studio
each
object
of
which
possessed
for
jim
some
poignant
association
seemed
strangely
familiar
yet
unreal
the
chairs
the
rugs
the
hangings
had
suddenly
become
merely
a
background
for
the
body
lying
among
them
a
part
of
it
linked
in
a
horrible
conspiracy
of
silence
moira
s
plain
furniture
her
easel
which
still
bore
the
placid
portrait
of
the
indomitable
parisienne
who
had
refused
to
be
a
the
arm
chair
by
the
fireplace
in
which
moira
had
sat
the
table
from
which
they
had
supped
the
lay
figure
in
its
old
costume
felt
hat
and
draperies
the
couch
by
the
window
the
brass
bowl
on
the
mantel
full
of
moira
s
of
them
spoke
so
eloquently
of
her
and
moira
he
frowned
as
he
tried
to
put
the
pieces
of
the
puzzle
together
the
knife
in
his
brother
s
side
had
been
intended
for
him
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
and
the
motive
for
the
crime
was
obvious
quinlevin
tricot
yes
but
how
his
glance
passed
over
the
room
again
and
again
seeking
in
vain
the
answer
his
guardian
had
preferred
to
await
the
arrival
of
his
superior
before
examining
the
kitchenette
and
but
with
the
door
locked
upon
the
outside
there
was
no
hope
that
the
solution
of
the
mystery
would
be
found
there
meanwhile
jim
horton
s
mind
became
slowly
impregnated
with
the
realization
of
his
own
position
which
must
become
more
dubious
when
he
answered
the
questions
of
the
for
answer
them
he
must
telling
the
whole
of
his
story
if
it
were
necessary
without
thought
of
consequences
to
himself
or
others
the
future
became
at
each
moment
more
ominous
horrible
as
the
thought
was
they
might
even
suspect
him
of
this
crime
and
even
if
he
escaped
that
disaster
with
the
publicity
which
must
follow
the
provost
guard
awaited
him
but
at
his
side
was
piquette
who
had
seen
what
he
had
seen
and
who
knew
what
he
knew
and
he
felt
her
fingers
clasp
his
with
a
valiant
touch
that
gave
him
courage
and
assurance
and
in
a
short
while
the
entered
followed
by
his
secretary
several
agents
and
newspaper
men
the
monsieur
matthieu
was
a
man
of
medium
height
strongly
built
with
small
sharp
eyes
and
reddish
hair
he
went
about
the
affair
with
a
mien
exchanging
a
few
words
with
the
policeman
who
had
first
come
glancing
quickly
at
horton
piquette
and
the
other
witnesses
let
no
one
enter
the
room
he
said
in
his
sharp
staccato
when
he
had
selected
his
witnesses
let
no
one
leave
it
then
quickly
he
questioned
horton
and
piquette
as
to
their
visit
and
the
exact
circumstances
of
their
discovery
of
the
body
horton
was
at
a
loss
but
piquette
spoke
rapidly
and
in
a
few
moments
had
given
the
a
complete
narration
of
their
experiences
from
the
moment
they
had
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
studio
of
madame
horton
you
say
that
you
and
this
monsieur
came
to
this
room
by
appointment
to
meet
madame
horton
at
eight
o
clock
questioned
the
yes
monsieur
that
you
came
up
the
stair
and
as
the
door
was
unlocked
you
entered
this
room
finding
it
empty
yes
monsieur
and
the
door
to
the
apartment
yonder
was
locked
from
this
side
and
the
key
was
in
the
lock
as
it
is
at
this
moment
yes
monsieur
the
rooms
beyond
then
have
not
yet
been
entered
he
asked
of
the
policeman
who
had
come
up
at
the
first
alarm
no
le
then
we
shall
enter
at
once
he
nodded
significantly
to
the
two
who
took
their
places
by
jim
and
piquette
and
with
his
secretary
and
the
policeman
following
him
matthieu
unlocked
the
door
into
the
kitchenette
and
investigated
the
kitchen
and
bedrooms
when
he
reappeared
some
moments
later
his
face
was
puzzled
but
he
went
to
the
big
studio
window
and
examined
the
catches
these
windows
you
say
were
also
locked
he
asked
of
horton
suddenly
in
excellent
english
they
of
them
said
horton
then
you
did
not
know
that
one
of
them
was
open
open
horton
crossed
the
room
eagerly
i
could
have
you
said
the
frenchman
and
touching
the
window
it
swung
open
noiselessly
that
s
strange
muttered
horton
i
thought
the
catch
was
on
but
even
so
he
added
there
was
no
chance
for
the
murderer
to
have
escaped
there
as
you
will
see
monsieur
it
is
a
blank
wall
of
full
three
stories
in
height
the
peered
out
there
was
a
broad
wooden
ledge
or
sill
just
outside
but
the
ledge
led
nowhere
and
he
could
see
that
what
horton
had
stated
was
true
it
was
sixty
feet
to
the
flagging
of
the
court
below
and
a
drop
meant
death
or
injury
to
any
one
who
dared
attempt
it
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
a
rope
or
ladder
we
shall
wait
for
daylight
for
that
in
the
he
relapsed
into
silence
gazing
about
the
room
with
great
care
examining
each
object
and
coming
at
last
to
the
body
it
has
not
been
touched
he
questioned
of
the
policeman
no
monsieur
he
walked
around
the
corpse
dictating
quickly
to
the
man
with
the
and
then
drew
the
knife
from
the
wound
it
was
a
affair
at
least
six
inches
in
length
a
weapon
evidently
intended
for
just
such
a
deadly
business
he
was
struck
below
the
left
arm
and
from
behind
piquette
heard
him
dictate
the
direction
of
the
weapon
in
the
body
indicating
without
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
that
the
wound
was
not
a
case
of
murder
he
finished
looking
up
at
horton
who
had
followed
his
motions
with
intense
interest
then
he
moved
the
body
so
that
it
lay
flat
upon
the
floor
throwing
a
pocket
light
full
upon
the
face
starting
back
in
amazement
monsieur
he
gasped
to
horton
and
then
threw
the
light
suddenly
into
jim
horton
s
face
monsieur
horton
did
you
it
is
my
brother
said
jim
quietly
d
un
i
could
swear
it
was
yourself
my
twin
brother
monsieur
repeated
horton
monsieur
matthieu
s
eyes
narrowed
as
he
gazed
at
jim
the
case
becomes
more
interesting
you
will
now
tell
me
please
what
happened
when
you
went
out
of
the
studio
into
the
hallway
horton
nodded
we
thought
of
going
away
and
returning
when
madame
horton
my
should
return
the
wife
of
the
murdered
man
broke
in
the
yes
monsieur
said
jim
as
we
were
about
to
go
down
to
the
court
below
we
heard
the
footsteps
of
some
one
coming
up
but
it
was
not
madame
horton
we
knew
that
by
the
sounds
it
was
a
man
s
we
withdrew
into
the
little
hall
room
and
watched
the
facts
are
curious
monsieur
horton
put
in
the
with
sudden
interest
why
did
you
wish
to
conceal
yourself
from
the
other
visitors
of
madame
horton
the
question
was
pertinent
and
there
could
be
no
evading
a
reply
so
jim
told
briefly
of
quinlevin
moira
and
harry
and
his
unfriendly
relationship
with
his
brother
as
he
did
so
he
heard
the
gasps
and
whisperings
among
the
listeners
which
gave
him
an
unpleasant
realization
of
their
conception
of
the
affair
and
the
testimony
of
piquette
who
grew
angry
at
the
sounds
from
the
auditors
did
nothing
to
improve
his
situation
i
see
monsieur
said
matthieu
sagely
it
is
wise
that
you
see
fit
to
tell
us
the
truth
now
since
it
must
all
come
out
later
there
was
bad
blood
between
you
and
your
brother
and
between
you
and
monsieur
that
you
feared
a
plot
in
the
which
meant
to
do
you
violence
not
when
i
received
the
message
monsieur
i
came
here
with
madame
morin
in
good
faith
to
try
and
help
madame
take
her
away
from
a
situation
in
which
she
was
most
unhappy
and
your
relations
with
your
asked
the
horton
flushed
angrily
but
he
realized
that
the
man
was
within
his
rights
as
piquette
cried
excitedly
madame
orton
was
on
appy
wit
er
usband
madame
horton
and
i
were
the
best
of
broke
in
jim
quietly
evidently
said
matthieu
dryly
the
changed
manner
of
monsieur
matthieu
his
sudden
air
of
intense
interest
in
jim
himself
and
the
keen
appraisal
in
his
eyes
did
not
augur
well
for
the
result
of
the
investigation
you
will
please
go
on
with
the
rest
of
the
story
monsieur
he
added
and
then
with
a
glance
at
piquette
and
you
madame
will
be
pleased
to
remain
silent
until
i
question
you
you
say
that
you
realized
that
the
visitor
coming
up
the
stair
was
a
man
and
that
you
and
madame
withdrew
in
the
darkness
into
the
little
and
waited
yes
monsieur
and
you
both
saw
the
man
come
up
the
stairs
to
the
studio
door
what
happened
then
he
turned
the
knob
and
entered
had
you
recognized
him
as
your
brother
at
that
time
i
hadn
t
i
thought
that
my
brother
had
joined
his
regiment
soldier
and
do
you
know
why
he
is
here
in
civilian
s
clothes
i
do
not
did
madame
morin
recognize
him
yes
but
i
didn
t
believe
it
was
then
monsieur
matthieu
smiled
and
shrugged
and
you
didn
t
realize
how
much
alike
you
were
in
your
dark
overcoats
and
soft
hats
no
and
after
your
brother
went
in
at
the
studio
door
how
long
did
you
and
madame
wait
in
the
hall
room
i
don
t
know
matter
of
four
or
five
minutes
when
we
heard
sounds
in
the
studio
and
the
falling
of
a
body
and
you
rushed
out
to
the
studio
door
and
went
in
asked
the
craftily
the
door
was
locked
said
jim
i
put
my
shoulder
against
it
and
broke
it
in
ah
you
broke
it
in
how
long
did
that
take
perhaps
half
a
minute
and
when
you
entered
the
room
madame
was
with
you
behin
heem
broke
in
piquette
eagerly
matthieu
glanced
at
piquette
with
a
frown
which
silenced
her
and
what
did
you
see
monsieur
what
you
saw
brother
lying
chair
no
sign
of
any
one
in
the
room
it
was
very
mystifying
yes
it
must
have
been
dryly
miraculous
in
fact
and
then
what
did
you
do
i
examined
the
room
was
bewildered
monsieur
i
couldn
t
understand
any
more
than
you
can
because
the
only
door
by
which
the
murderer
could
have
escaped
i
found
to
be
you
found
it
monsieur
most
extraordinary
and
what
is
your
theory
as
to
the
escape
of
the
murderer
i
haven
t
any
the
more
i
think
the
more
astounding
it
seems
i
couldn
t
believe
unless
i
had
seen
all
these
things
with
my
own
eyes
and
you
madame
he
asked
at
last
in
french
turning
to
piquette
what
monsieur
tells
is
the
truth
le
i
swear
monsieur
matthieu
laughed
come
now
what
you
two
ask
me
to
think
is
beyond
belief
i
come
to
this
room
and
find
a
man
murdered
by
a
dastardly
blow
dealt
by
a
man
of
great
muscular
force
here
he
ran
a
careless
glance
up
and
down
jim
horton
s
long
figure
the
only
door
by
which
he
could
have
escaped
is
locked
exit
by
the
window
is
impossible
and
you
and
madame
guard
the
stairs
until
the
crowd
gathers
do
you
think
you
will
get
me
to
believe
that
the
murderer
flew
up
the
chimney
i
don
t
ask
you
to
believe
anything
said
jim
trying
to
keep
his
nerve
but
i
must
believe
the
evidence
of
my
observation
there
is
no
way
in
which
the
man
could
have
passed
you
on
the
stair
none
said
jim
helplessly
until
i
came
up
with
the
policeman
no
one
went
down
that
is
true
added
piquette
monsieur
orton
was
armed
no
one
could
have
passed
him
here
the
was
puzzled
for
what
had
seemed
clearer
a
moment
ago
was
lost
in
the
frankness
of
this
confession
where
are
the
other
witnesses
in
the
case
he
asked
of
the
policeman
here
monsieur
indicating
one
of
the
men
he
had
detained
this
man
was
in
the
hall
with
the
crowd
these
others
too
are
willing
to
testify
the
secretary
took
the
witness
s
name
paul
joubert
his
address
and
matthieu
questioned
him
you
have
heard
the
testimony
of
monsieur
horton
yes
monsieur
it
is
true
in
every
particular
i
and
these
others
indicating
the
men
beside
him
came
up
the
stairs
to
the
landing
and
entered
the
studio
how
many
were
there
in
the
crowd
dozen
he
replied
while
the
others
confirmed
him
did
you
know
them
all
ah
no
monsieur
i
live
in
the
court
at
the
rear
some
of
them
were
strangers
who
ran
in
from
the
street
there
was
no
one
in
the
upper
hall
no
one
and
in
the
one
of
the
men
who
had
rushed
up
examined
the
room
and
said
it
was
empty
i
went
in
myself
also
and
saw
that
this
was
so
is
the
man
who
first
went
into
the
here
no
le
i
do
not
recognize
him
the
light
from
the
doorway
was
dim
all
right
said
matthieu
no
matter
and
then
and
the
other
door
from
the
apartment
to
the
hallway
remained
locked
all
the
time
he
asked
yes
monsieur
no
one
came
out
of
there
we
tried
it
many
times
and
you
have
no
theory
as
to
how
any
one
could
have
escaped
from
the
room
under
the
circumstances
no
monsieur
it
is
nothing
less
than
a
miracle
the
other
witnesses
shook
their
heads
in
confirmation
of
the
testimony
that
will
do
monsieur
joubert
and
then
turning
to
horton
now
monsieur
horton
what
did
you
think
when
you
found
the
body
of
your
brother
when
you
had
positive
proof
that
unless
the
murderer
had
jumped
from
the
window
to
death
he
must
at
that
moment
have
been
in
the
room
horton
had
courage
but
he
couldn
t
deceive
himself
as
to
the
intent
of
the
question
the
cord
was
tightening
he
felt
it
in
the
looks
of
those
around
him
in
the
frightened
breathing
of
piquette
and
in
the
steady
gaze
of
his
questioner
which
he
met
with
more
and
more
difficulty
but
he
managed
to
answer
calmly
think
why
i
couldn
t
think
monsieur
i
was
bewildered
dazed
stupefied
with
astonishment
and
horror
but
you
must
give
me
credit
for
some
intelligence
protested
the
since
the
murderer
couldn
t
have
gone
out
of
the
door
while
you
say
you
were
breaking
in
he
must
have
been
in
the
room
all
the
while
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
i
searched
it
that
is
true
almost
screamed
piquette
in
her
excitement
i
was
wit
im
there
was
no
one
quietly
madame
said
matthieu
reprovingly
and
then
monsieur
horton
when
you
searched
the
room
what
did
you
do
what
would
have
done
rushed
down
the
stair
and
gave
the
alarm
watching
the
stair
and
waiting
for
the
police
i
am
as
mystified
as
you
if
i
could
tell
you
any
more
i
would
do
so
monsieur
matthieu
tapped
his
thoughtfully
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
spoke
and
then
where
is
madame
horton
i
don
t
know
and
monsieur
quinlevin
i
don
t
know
you
have
no
means
of
helping
me
to
find
them
if
i
had
i
would
tell
you
a
pause
and
then
the
cleared
his
throat
in
an
important
manner
i
have
a
feeling
that
you
are
keeping
something
back
monsieur
horton
i
warn
you
that
you
will
not
make
things
easy
for
yourself
in
making
them
difficult
for
me
what
do
you
mean
monsieur
asked
jim
sure
that
his
position
and
piquette
s
had
now
grown
desperate
merely
monsieur
said
the
with
a
glance
at
the
dead
man
that
blows
such
as
this
are
not
struck
by
spiritual
agencies
that
when
there
is
a
murdered
man
there
must
also
be
a
murderer
your
testimony
and
that
of
madame
morin
agree
but
then
i
can
not
neglect
the
possibility
that
you
may
have
some
object
in
agreeing
you
believe
that
horton
broke
in
in
horror
i
believe
nothing
until
it
is
definitely
proved
i
admit
that
there
are
many
phases
of
this
case
which
seem
favorable
to
a
belief
in
your
story
but
there
are
also
some
points
which
from
your
testimony
seem
to
we
do
not
live
in
an
age
of
miracles
murders
are
not
committed
by
spirits
who
vanish
there
was
bad
blood
between
you
and
your
brother
you
yourself
have
admitted
it
madame
morin
had
a
suspicion
when
he
came
up
the
stair
that
the
you
received
was
a
trap
intended
for
which
my
brother
fell
into
said
horton
in
a
last
desperate
effort
to
clear
himself
why
monsieur
you
yourself
can
see
how
like
we
are
the
blow
was
intended
for
you
are
fortunate
monsieur
said
the
with
a
shrug
and
you
will
have
every
chance
to
prove
your
innocence
but
i
can
not
take
the
grave
responsibility
of
liberating
you
the
case
must
go
to
the
and
will
be
heard
in
its
entirety
including
the
many
details
which
have
been
suggested
as
to
madame
horton
and
monsieur
quinlevin
i
am
only
sent
here
to
investigate
the
case
in
its
physical
aspects
and
the
result
of
the
investigation
is
to
place
you
and
madame
morin
under
arrest
horton
straightened
and
glanced
around
at
the
others
in
the
room
they
had
ceased
to
have
personalities
they
looked
like
wax
at
him
in
wonder
in
curiosity
as
though
he
were
already
condemned
from
them
his
glance
found
piquette
her
face
was
white
and
she
was
staring
at
the
as
though
she
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
her
ears
why
monsieur
have
we
not
told
he
heard
her
begin
when
the
officer
silenced
her
you
will
have
every
opportunity
to
testify
madame
she
sent
one
glance
at
him
the
in
her
terrified
at
the
law
as
represented
in
the
man
before
her
and
then
bewildered
rushed
to
jim
and
caught
him
by
the
hand
courage
she
gasped
you
ave
on
y
to
speak
de
truth
i
m
not
frightened
he
said
but
you
it
s
not
she
said
bravely
but
he
saw
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
and
now
broke
in
the
who
had
watched
this
byplay
with
some
interest
i
am
sorry
that
we
must
be
off
come
and
giving
some
instructions
as
to
the
witnesses
to
one
of
the
de
who
had
accompanied
him
and
taking
the
revolver
which
horton
silently
offered
him
he
led
the
way
down
the
stair
with
piquette
and
horton
following
policemen
at
their
elbows
a
great
crowd
had
assembled
in
the
street
and
courtyard
below
horton
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
white
cap
and
whiter
face
of
madame
toupin
at
the
door
of
her
and
then
was
hurried
by
a
policeman
into
a
carriage
which
was
awaiting
them
he
saw
poor
piquette
put
into
another
one
and
they
drove
off
in
the
direction
of
the
de
where
he
was
shown
without
ceremony
into
a
cell
alone
to
await
a
further
investigation
upon
the
morrow
he
sank
down
upon
the
cot
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
and
tried
to
think
quinlevin
was
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
them
had
done
this
dastardly
thing
believing
to
save
their
skins
and
thinking
that
they
were
killing
him
but
how
had
the
murderer
gotten
away
how
how
the
events
in
the
h√¥tel
de
paris
at
nice
the
revelation
in
monsieur
de
vautrin
s
rooms
the
confession
of
piquette
morin
and
the
startling
events
that
immediately
followed
it
were
all
bewildering
from
affection
for
quinlevin
moira
had
passed
through
the
stages
of
incredulity
doubt
and
reassurance
and
then
at
nora
s
downfall
dismay
at
her
own
position
and
after
quinlevin
s
brutal
treatment
of
her
aversion
and
terror
when
he
turned
the
key
of
her
door
and
went
with
piquette
into
his
own
room
she
threw
herself
into
her
chair
aware
of
her
dependence
upon
him
and
yet
ready
to
run
away
and
throw
herself
upon
the
mercy
of
the
first
stranger
that
she
could
find
but
the
sounds
that
came
from
behind
the
closed
door
fascinated
her
the
murmur
of
conversation
rising
and
falling
and
then
the
strange
noises
heard
indistinctly
yet
frightful
in
their
significance
the
silence
that
followed
still
more
suggestive
she
shrank
upon
her
bed
in
terror
shutting
her
ears
with
her
fingers
then
the
renewal
of
the
commotion
as
she
raised
her
hands
her
terror
inquisitive
for
the
sound
of
blows
the
grunts
of
men
in
struggle
and
then
the
falling
of
a
body
tricot
and
were
killing
each
other
that
was
the
chief
thought
in
her
and
the
imperative
need
of
escape
she
got
up
trembling
and
went
to
the
door
shooting
the
brass
bolt
then
turned
catching
up
her
coat
and
gloves
the
door
into
the
corridor
was
locked
but
she
could
still
go
out
through
nora
s
room
she
tried
the
other
door
but
found
it
locked
on
the
outside
she
called
nora
softly
then
more
loudly
and
heard
the
woman
answer
presently
by
dint
of
wild
persuasion
she
prevailed
upon
her
old
nurse
to
open
the
door
nora
was
red
of
face
disheveled
and
bewildered
what
is
it
ye
want
alanah
i
must
must
go
with
me
she
stammered
for
why
isn
t
it
enough
i
ve
been
through
this
day
but
moira
pushed
her
way
past
the
woman
something
dreadful
has
there
she
stammered
her
face
white
i
can
t
what
a
quinlevin
and
the
woman
tried
to
restrain
her
but
moira
flung
herself
away
and
unlocked
the
door
ye
ll
not
be
lavin
me
here
alone
gasped
nora
come
then
quickly
and
she
fled
out
into
the
corridor
the
woman
following
down
the
stairway
and
into
the
night
the
memory
of
those
dreadful
hours
of
wandering
with
nora
along
the
roads
was
like
a
dream
in
a
fever
but
after
awhile
the
physical
exercise
made
her
more
calm
and
she
was
able
to
explain
to
the
frightened
irish
woman
what
had
happened
her
first
impulse
had
been
to
flee
from
it
escape
without
money
where
should
she
go
with
the
return
of
reason
came
courage
and
with
courage
a
resolve
to
go
back
and
do
what
she
could
for
piquette
morin
they
would
not
have
dared
to
kill
her
it
was
impossible
an
impulse
to
tell
the
people
of
the
hotel
what
had
happened
came
to
her
again
but
as
she
turned
toward
the
gardens
followed
heavily
by
the
frightened
nora
she
resolved
to
go
upstairs
and
face
whatever
was
in
store
for
her
what
she
found
was
rather
terrifying
at
first
but
when
she
summoned
nerve
enough
to
turn
on
the
light
she
saw
two
swaddled
figures
squirming
to
be
free
madame
morin
had
vanished
with
the
help
of
nora
who
came
out
of
her
state
of
coma
when
the
facts
were
made
obvious
she
liberated
the
two
men
and
questioned
eagerly
didn
t
before
was
quinlevin
s
reply
he
was
not
pleasant
to
look
at
i
was
frightened
at
the
sounds
i
ran
away
what
has
happened
isn
t
it
obvious
mumbled
the
irishman
spitting
out
a
fragment
of
the
cotton
towel
from
his
dry
throat
jim
horton
gasped
moira
the
him
and
madame
need
you
guess
he
sneered
they
re
well
on
the
road
to
paris
by
now
thank
god
said
moira
fervently
he
glanced
at
her
but
said
nothing
his
feelings
were
too
deep
for
words
but
the
day
following
moira
was
to
learn
her
dependence
upon
him
he
took
little
pains
to
conceal
the
change
of
his
feelings
towards
her
the
suddenness
of
which
proclaimed
only
too
insistently
the
fact
that
his
years
of
kindness
were
only
the
device
jim
horton
had
proved
them
to
be
on
the
way
back
to
paris
he
was
for
the
most
part
silent
and
morose
remaining
much
of
the
time
with
the
abominable
tricot
leaving
moira
to
the
tender
mercies
of
her
old
nurse
who
now
shared
with
her
the
irishman
s
displeasure
it
was
indeed
a
sisterhood
of
consolation
and
she
saw
that
with
the
failure
of
the
great
plan
nora
was
much
chastened
by
her
experience
for
she
sat
and
wailed
in
a
most
discomfiting
manner
confessing
at
last
her
share
in
the
conspiracy
and
throwing
herself
upon
moira
s
mercy
moira
was
sorry
for
the
woman
who
had
brought
her
safely
through
her
baby
diseases
and
acted
as
guide
counselor
and
friend
until
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
away
to
boarding
school
and
so
mingled
with
the
contempt
that
moira
felt
for
her
there
was
a
little
pity
too
and
a
leaven
of
the
old
affection
in
those
moments
of
rapprochement
and
confession
moira
learned
in
astonishment
the
secret
of
her
birth
jim
horton
had
not
been
mistaken
she
was
not
the
daughter
of
barry
quinlevin
but
his
niece
posthumous
daughter
of
his
younger
brother
whose
widow
had
died
in
childbirth
barry
quinlevin
s
own
wife
an
invalid
and
bedridden
had
acquiesced
in
the
plan
of
adopting
the
daughter
of
her
but
had
not
known
in
the
few
years
before
her
own
death
of
the
deception
that
was
to
be
practiced
upon
monsieur
de
vautrin
the
community
in
which
the
families
lived
was
sparsely
settled
the
neighbors
ignorant
and
illiterate
if
monsieur
de
vautrin
had
taken
pains
to
make
inquiries
at
this
time
he
must
surely
have
discovered
the
ruse
but
he
had
apparently
taken
all
things
told
him
for
granted
or
was
too
enwrapped
in
his
own
selfish
pursuits
to
give
the
case
attention
so
long
as
he
was
left
to
the
enjoyment
of
his
fortune
by
the
paying
of
the
tribute
quinlevin
demanded
he
was
satisfied
and
so
quinlevin
managed
things
in
his
own
way
paying
nora
for
her
silence
and
keeping
moira
in
ignorance
as
to
the
source
of
their
income
if
quinlevin
guessed
the
nature
of
the
conversation
that
passed
between
the
two
women
upon
the
train
he
gave
no
sign
of
it
but
when
they
reached
paris
and
returned
to
the
studio
he
seemed
to
experience
a
change
of
heart
toward
moira
did
what
he
could
to
restore
the
breach
in
their
old
relations
admitting
the
truth
of
nora
s
confession
and
shrugging
off
his
failure
as
a
matter
that
was
ended
apparently
taking
moira
s
forgiveness
for
granted
he
treated
her
in
their
new
relation
of
uncle
and
niece
with
marked
consideration
and
planned
in
his
grandiose
way
for
the
future
he
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
money
and
spent
it
upon
her
generously
but
he
did
not
leave
her
for
a
moment
and
when
he
proposed
a
trip
to
fontainebleau
a
spot
which
in
former
years
she
had
loved
to
visit
he
asked
her
to
accompany
him
her
reasons
for
acquiescence
were
logical
enough
until
she
decided
upon
a
definite
plan
of
separation
from
him
she
thought
it
wisest
to
assume
an
attitude
of
forbearance
she
wanted
to
go
away
somewhere
where
she
could
think
and
she
wanted
to
hide
herself
where
jim
horton
couldn
t
find
her
for
she
was
sure
that
he
would
not
be
content
to
let
their
affair
remain
as
she
had
desired
it
he
would
come
pleading
with
her
and
knows
what
she
would
do
alone
was
herself
the
little
inn
in
the
forest
where
they
stopped
was
not
far
from
the
house
of
some
friends
of
moira
s
and
thither
if
the
opportunity
offered
she
could
go
for
sanctuary
but
here
again
she
felt
the
constant
supervision
of
her
indomitable
and
uncle
he
recovered
some
of
his
old
spirits
and
his
old
affection
as
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
obliterate
from
her
memory
the
last
few
weeks
which
had
been
so
disastrous
to
them
both
but
she
accepted
these
marks
of
his
regeneration
with
reserve
enjoying
the
rest
and
recuperation
and
trying
her
best
to
forget
the
man
she
loved
praying
for
strength
and
guidance
and
planning
the
struggle
for
existence
which
must
begin
when
this
brief
interlude
came
to
an
end
and
so
in
a
few
days
she
lulled
him
into
a
sense
of
security
and
convinced
him
of
her
spirit
of
resignation
she
wandered
off
alone
into
the
forest
and
sometimes
did
not
see
him
for
hours
at
a
time
but
she
did
not
attempt
escape
she
was
thinking
deeply
she
was
still
afraid
that
an
escape
from
quinlevin
meant
the
greater
danger
to
her
soul
it
was
upon
her
return
from
one
of
her
solitary
pilgrimages
through
the
dripping
woods
for
the
early
morn
had
been
foggy
that
she
learned
that
barry
quinlevin
was
still
in
bed
she
smiled
as
she
thought
how
easily
her
acquiescence
had
disarmed
him
but
when
she
sent
up
a
message
that
she
had
returned
he
sent
down
word
that
he
would
join
her
at
something
of
the
old
attraction
toward
him
still
remained
in
spite
of
her
knowledge
of
his
villainy
she
had
not
yet
been
able
to
obliterate
from
her
mind
the
many
years
of
his
encouragement
in
her
work
his
gentleness
and
the
many
marks
of
affection
in
his
strange
way
he
loved
her
and
the
fact
that
she
now
felt
contempt
for
him
did
not
disguise
the
fact
that
she
felt
a
little
pity
too
but
she
knew
that
she
must
decide
very
soon
what
she
would
do
there
were
so
many
years
to
set
in
the
balance
against
the
present
rogue
yes
but
full
of
consideration
and
a
lively
appreciation
of
the
creature
that
he
had
made
her
to
cut
him
out
of
her
and
as
she
had
learned
to
despise
him
was
not
easy
but
she
must
do
her
own
next
day
as
she
thought
of
her
problems
she
sank
into
an
arm
chair
by
the
fire
and
picked
up
a
copy
of
a
morning
paper
which
a
new
visitor
had
just
brought
in
from
the
city
it
was
part
of
moira
s
purpose
in
hiding
herself
from
the
world
to
hide
also
the
world
from
herself
but
she
picked
up
the
and
in
a
moment
was
absorbed
in
the
account
of
the
projected
peace
conference
but
as
she
turned
the
page
her
glance
fell
upon
a
familiar
familiar
names
and
in
a
moment
her
eyes
starting
from
her
head
she
read
the
dreadful
headlines
murder
in
a
studio
in
the
quartier
captain
horton
killed
under
strange
circumstances
then
the
news
which
followed
describing
briefly
for
space
was
valuable
the
known
facts
regarding
the
mystery
the
arrest
of
an
american
james
horton
and
a
french
woman
piquette
morin
pending
a
further
investigation
of
the
mysterious
crime
apparently
all
the
facts
in
the
possession
of
the
police
were
given
which
unless
some
other
details
of
the
mystery
were
discovered
pointed
the
finger
of
suspicion
at
the
american
who
was
the
twin
brother
of
the
dead
man
moira
read
with
growing
horror
the
familiar
address
the
names
of
madame
toupin
and
the
other
tenants
her
own
name
and
barry
quinlevin
s
whose
absence
had
added
to
the
mystery
the
type
danced
before
her
eyes
like
the
shifting
colors
in
a
kaleidoscope
and
then
became
merged
and
incomprehensible
was
she
dreaming
with
an
effort
she
focused
again
upon
the
damnable
page
aware
of
this
new
crisis
that
had
sought
her
out
from
the
depths
of
her
retreat
what
had
he
been
doing
at
the
studio
there
must
be
some
mistake
harry
was
at
camp
a
hundred
miles
murderer
the
thing
was
impossible
she
got
up
paper
in
hand
and
scarcely
aware
of
what
she
was
doing
went
to
her
room
and
quickly
put
on
her
hat
and
coat
coming
down
stairs
a
few
moments
later
and
taking
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
railroad
station
she
had
no
definite
plan
except
to
escape
her
uncle
and
get
to
paris
as
quickly
as
possible
but
she
was
aware
that
some
instinct
was
guiding
her
she
inquired
of
the
station
agent
when
the
paris
train
was
due
she
was
lucky
there
would
be
a
train
in
half
an
hour
she
bought
a
ticket
out
of
the
slender
means
in
her
possession
and
waited
going
over
and
over
in
her
mind
the
terrible
phrases
which
seemed
already
to
have
burned
themselves
indelibly
upon
her
memory
the
motive
for
the
crime
there
seemed
to
be
except
that
the
two
brothers
had
not
been
friendly
motive
holy
virgin
she
leaned
against
a
tree
by
the
roadside
and
wordlessly
prayed
not
that
that
and
jim
the
things
he
had
suffered
through
harry
his
own
misplaced
gallantry
and
through
he
was
not
the
man
who
could
have
done
this
thing
when
she
raised
her
head
listening
for
the
sounds
of
the
train
a
smile
was
on
her
lips
a
new
smile
of
confidence
and
faith
she
had
tried
him
she
knew
the
kind
of
man
he
was
he
could
fight
in
the
open
as
a
brave
man
should
but
not
in
the
dark
not
with
a
dastardly
blow
for
his
own
brother
in
the
dark
when
the
train
came
in
she
was
calm
again
and
resolved
whatever
skill
whatever
intelligence
she
had
was
to
be
dedicated
to
solving
this
mystery
and
clearing
jim
horton
of
all
complicity
in
the
murder
her
name
was
mentioned
the
police
required
her
presence
she
would
go
to
them
and
tell
her
whole
story
neglecting
nothing
whatever
it
cost
her
she
stared
at
the
passing
scenery
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
but
there
was
a
frown
at
her
brows
and
her
lips
were
drawn
together
in
a
firm
line
she
was
beginning
to
see
with
an
inner
vision
to
turn
over
one
by
one
the
events
of
the
last
few
weeks
and
the
motives
of
all
those
concerned
in
them
the
police
did
not
know
who
had
committed
this
crime
if
jim
horton
were
innocent
the
circumstances
were
such
as
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
any
one
escaping
from
the
room
yet
some
one
must
have
been
there
and
some
one
somehow
must
have
out
of
her
own
knowledge
emerged
a
motive
for
a
of
harry
but
of
his
motive
that
had
already
been
the
cause
of
two
abortive
attempts
upon
his
life
somehow
this
thought
emerged
with
photographic
distinctness
from
the
others
becoming
at
each
moment
more
definite
and
more
full
of
sinister
suggestion
but
a
life
perhaps
two
lives
one
of
them
jim
horton
s
hung
upon
the
keenness
of
her
vision
and
intelligence
if
monsieur
matthieu
the
whose
name
had
been
given
in
the
was
balked
in
getting
at
the
truth
she
would
help
him
there
were
many
things
he
did
not
know
many
things
that
she
could
tell
him
such
as
would
perhaps
open
new
vistas
for
investigation
quite
calmly
now
she
took
out
the
paper
and
the
details
her
imagination
catching
at
neglected
clues
her
instinct
groping
and
her
horror
at
the
thought
of
jim
in
his
prison
but
of
other
suspicions
that
rose
from
every
known
fact
and
confronted
accusing
fingers
she
passed
between
the
white
columns
of
the
entrance
to
the
palais
de
justice
through
the
iron
and
gilt
barrier
and
then
paused
but
not
in
any
fear
for
her
mind
was
made
up
and
her
courage
had
come
back
to
her
with
a
rush
that
put
to
shame
her
days
of
uncertainty
so
she
approached
one
of
the
palace
guards
and
asked
to
be
shown
to
the
office
of
the
the
she
was
informed
was
not
in
the
building
would
any
one
else
do
was
it
upon
a
matter
connected
with
the
administration
of
justice
she
replied
promptly
that
she
came
upon
a
matter
in
connection
with
the
murder
mystery
in
the
studio
at
no
rue
de
tavennes
and
the
man
pricked
up
his
ears
conducting
her
promptly
up
a
long
flight
of
stone
steps
to
the
left
where
he
told
her
she
would
find
the
d
and
when
in
reply
to
his
question
as
to
what
name
he
should
announce
she
told
him
that
she
was
madame
horton
his
interest
and
activity
were
intense
with
a
word
to
the
who
stood
near
he
disappeared
through
a
door
and
in
a
moment
returned
with
two
gentlemen
who
hurried
forward
to
meet
her
introducing
themselves
as
monsieur
simon
the
d
who
had
taken
charge
of
the
investigation
and
monsieur
matthieu
the
de
for
the
district
in
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
she
followed
them
through
the
door
from
which
they
had
emerged
and
answering
their
questions
told
her
story
without
hesitation
from
the
moment
of
her
visit
to
jim
horton
at
the
hospital
at
neuilly
until
she
had
read
in
the
morning
paper
of
the
crime
i
came
messieurs
because
it
was
my
duty
to
aid
you
in
clearing
up
this
mystery
and
because
i
know
that
whatever
the
evidence
you
hold
against
him
monsieur
horton
could
never
have
been
guilty
of
this
crime
monsieur
simon
wagged
his
head
sagely
and
plucked
with
slender
white
fingers
at
his
dark
beard
we
are
greatly
indebted
to
you
madame
our
agents
have
been
looking
for
you
no
doubt
they
would
have
found
you
in
time
but
it
was
wiser
for
you
to
wiser
your
story
is
interesting
and
may
do
much
to
help
monsieur
matthieu
in
his
investigation
but
you
must
admit
madame
broke
in
the
practical
who
had
a
reputation
at
stake
that
instead
of
tending
to
clear
monsieur
horton
of
suspicion
you
have
only
added
one
more
thread
to
the
net
that
already
enmeshes
him
what
do
you
mean
monsieur
his
love
for
dislike
for
your
moira
flushed
painfully
i
have
told
you
the
truth
of
this
matter
because
i
believe
that
only
by
knowing
the
whole
truth
will
you
be
able
to
solve
this
mystery
if
monsieur
horton
tells
you
that
the
studio
was
empty
he
tells
you
what
he
believes
to
be
the
truth
why
otherwise
would
he
lie
about
a
situation
which
must
surely
condemn
him
we
have
thought
of
all
that
madame
said
monsieur
simon
and
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
there
are
several
points
in
his
testimony
which
are
very
puzzling
we
have
only
finished
his
examination
and
that
of
madame
morin
which
have
lasted
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
both
he
and
madame
morin
have
repeated
without
the
slightest
divergence
the
testimony
taken
in
the
preliminary
examination
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
i
am
glad
to
say
also
that
their
statements
confirm
in
a
general
way
your
own
in
regard
to
what
has
happened
in
the
affair
of
the
duc
de
vautrin
the
entire
department
of
police
is
now
upon
a
search
for
monsieur
barry
quinlevin
and
the
man
named
tricot
who
will
of
course
be
given
the
opportunity
to
explain
where
they
were
last
night
at
eight
o
clock
an
agent
goes
at
once
to
fontainebleau
but
that
does
not
exonerate
monsieur
horton
or
madame
morin
a
man
has
been
killed
in
a
room
from
which
the
murderer
could
not
have
emerged
without
detection
the
door
to
the
sleeping
apartments
was
locked
the
key
on
the
outside
the
window
was
sixty
feet
from
the
stone
flagging
below
the
window
and
wall
were
carefully
studied
this
morning
after
daybreak
the
murderer
could
not
have
climbed
down
it
is
impossible
monsieur
horton
admits
that
he
did
not
escape
by
the
stair
how
then
did
he
escape
the
doors
have
been
guarded
he
is
not
there
now
nor
did
monsieur
horton
discover
him
either
before
or
after
the
and
yet
he
was
there
monsieur
said
moira
her
voice
gathering
strength
and
clearness
from
the
depth
of
her
faith
and
conviction
he
was
there
le
she
repeated
all
the
time
nothing
else
is
possible
monsieur
matthieu
tapped
his
eyeglasses
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
i
should
be
very
willing
to
believe
you
madame
he
said
with
polite
scepticism
had
i
not
ocular
demonstration
that
there
could
have
been
no
one
in
the
room
at
any
moment
between
the
arrival
of
monsieur
horton
and
madame
morin
and
the
alarm
given
by
monsieur
horton
himself
i
have
not
yet
exhausted
every
avenue
of
investigation
but
i
need
not
conceal
from
you
the
extreme
danger
of
the
position
in
which
monsieur
horton
finds
himself
we
have
a
motive
for
the
crime
even
you
madame
have
only
added
testimony
as
to
that
with
his
brother
dead
there
was
no
obstacle
to
your
unfortunate
moira
had
drawn
back
from
him
in
dismay
her
face
blanched
again
if
i
seem
cruel
i
only
speak
with
the
cold
logic
of
the
professional
analyst
of
human
motives
the
fact
that
you
are
a
catholic
and
opposed
to
divorce
only
provides
another
reason
why
your
husband
should
be
removed
from
the
path
of
monsieur
everything
that
moira
had
said
seemed
to
be
weaving
more
tightly
the
skein
of
evidence
around
the
man
she
loved
and
this
thinking
machine
in
the
eyeglasses
grasped
only
at
the
threads
that
seemed
to
incriminate
him
and
what
of
the
other
evidence
that
she
had
they
disregard
that
she
was
trying
to
think
clearly
connectedly
and
presently
managed
to
put
her
thoughts
into
words
have
you
discovered
how
or
why
monsieur
jim
horton
happened
to
be
at
the
studio
and
why
if
he
was
bent
upon
the
murder
of
his
own
brother
he
took
madame
morin
as
a
or
put
in
monsieur
matthieu
sharply
that
is
broke
in
moira
with
some
spirit
and
you
know
it
monsieur
simon
nodded
approval
i
am
glad
you
have
made
that
point
madame
it
is
our
trade
to
make
our
witnesses
uncomfortable
that
they
may
controvert
themselves
but
you
have
probed
quite
straight
and
instead
of
answering
your
question
permit
me
to
ask
you
another
did
you
send
a
to
monsieur
horton
requesting
him
to
come
to
your
studio
last
night
at
eight
o
clock
the
expression
upon
moira
s
face
showed
so
genuine
an
astonishment
that
there
could
be
no
doubting
the
sincerity
of
her
reply
i
no
monsieur
simon
i
was
at
fontainebleau
why
should
i
ask
him
to
come
to
the
studio
when
i
was
not
there
the
two
men
exchanged
glances
of
new
interest
both
monsieur
horton
and
madame
morin
testify
that
monsieur
horton
received
such
a
message
moira
started
forward
in
her
chair
what
did
that
message
say
messieurs
monsieur
simon
took
the
blue
slip
from
a
packet
of
papers
and
laid
it
before
her
with
eyes
dilated
she
read
the
message
that
was
signed
with
her
name
then
for
a
moment
frowned
deeply
staring
at
this
confirmation
of
her
suspicion
what
do
you
think
madame
asked
simon
moira
was
silent
for
a
moment
struggling
for
the
mastery
of
her
emotions
and
then
in
a
suppressed
tone
barely
audible
it
is
as
i
supposed
messieurs
monsieur
jim
horton
was
lured
to
the
studio
by
this
message
killed
by
mistake
in
his
stead
by
whom
madame
asked
the
judge
quickly
moira
made
a
nervous
gesture
of
recantation
do
not
know
it
is
horrible
to
suspect
without
further
proof
can
not
say
monsieur
quinlevin
that
s
impossible
he
was
at
fontainebleau
then
that
s
for
you
to
find
out
i
did
not
come
to
to
liberate
search
find
let
their
own
words
convict
them
she
said
wildly
i
can
not
i
only
know
that
monsieur
horton
did
not
kill
my
husband
that
is
impossible
monsieur
matthieu
who
had
listened
for
most
of
the
while
in
silence
now
rose
and
took
a
pace
or
two
before
her
tapping
his
glasses
quickly
against
his
palm
madame
horton
let
us
confine
ourselves
to
the
physical
evidence
that
confronts
us
one
could
have
been
in
that
studio
between
the
moment
when
monsieur
jim
horton
and
madame
morin
say
they
left
it
until
they
say
they
returned
some
moments
that
is
the
fact
i
know
it
is
my
business
to
neglect
nothing
i
neglected
nothing
therefore
i
tell
you
that
no
matter
whom
you
suspect
to
have
committed
this
murder
no
matter
whom
monsieur
simon
or
i
might
believe
to
have
had
a
motive
in
committing
it
the
fact
remains
that
he
could
not
have
entered
the
studio
or
departed
from
it
during
the
short
period
in
which
this
crime
was
committed
and
i
say
to
you
now
that
human
being
except
monsieur
horton
could
have
been
present
to
commit
this
and
yet
said
moira
desperately
a
human
being
other
than
monsieur
horton
killed
my
husband
monsieur
matthieu
shrugged
and
smiled
you
have
not
investigated
as
i
have
done
madame
he
said
no
monsieur
but
i
am
right
she
said
firmly
you
are
persistent
it
is
my
duty
to
find
the
truth
of
this
matter
and
not
to
achieve
the
monsieur
simon
whose
nervous
fingers
had
been
caressing
his
dark
beard
while
his
small
eyes
followed
the
changing
emotions
in
moira
s
troubled
face
now
broke
into
the
discussion
with
some
spirit
it
is
not
safe
le
to
disregard
the
intuitions
of
a
woman
in
this
case
since
we
have
weighed
all
immediate
evidence
perhaps
it
would
be
wise
to
give
madame
horton
the
opportunity
of
confirming
to
her
own
satisfaction
the
results
of
your
investigation
monsieur
matthieu
smiled
and
shrugged
again
monsieur
if
you
think
it
worth
while
at
least
it
can
do
no
harm
madame
horton
is
familiar
with
her
own
studio
perhaps
she
may
notice
something
that
has
escaped
your
eye
as
you
please
it
is
that
which
you
desire
madame
asked
the
judge
oh
thanks
monsieur
uttered
moira
gratefully
i
could
not
be
satisfied
even
after
the
skill
of
le
unless
i
had
probed
this
mystery
with
my
own
eyes
come
then
madame
there
is
still
time
we
shall
go
at
once
the
body
of
harry
horton
had
been
removed
from
the
studio
and
this
it
seemed
made
moira
s
task
less
painful
but
she
was
now
armed
with
a
desperate
courage
which
even
the
sight
of
harry
s
mangled
body
would
not
have
dismayed
and
the
thought
that
her
keenness
of
perception
her
intelligence
her
woman
s
instinct
were
the
only
weapons
she
had
with
which
to
combat
the
scepticism
of
this
skillful
detective
and
save
jim
horton
from
the
perils
of
impending
indictment
for
murder
gave
her
a
sense
of
responsibility
which
keyed
her
faculties
to
their
utmost
and
drove
from
her
heart
all
terrors
of
her
situation
she
succeed
where
monsieur
matthieu
had
failed
instinct
would
guide
her
instinct
and
faith
monsieur
matthieu
if
not
her
enemy
was
prejudiced
in
favor
of
a
idea
which
every
bit
of
evidence
justified
and
yet
there
must
be
other
neglected
trifles
she
must
find
them
out
the
burden
of
the
testimony
against
jim
horton
would
fall
if
she
could
prove
it
physically
possible
some
one
to
have
been
in
the
studio
while
jim
horton
and
piquette
had
waited
this
was
her
else
seemed
to
matter
on
the
way
to
the
rue
de
tavennes
in
a
cab
monsieur
simon
replied
politely
to
her
questions
giving
her
all
the
information
she
desired
while
monsieur
matthieu
sat
opposite
how
she
hated
the
man
his
smile
patronized
his
reddish
hair
inflamed
her
she
could
see
that
in
his
mind
jim
horton
was
already
convicted
but
when
they
reached
the
of
madame
toupin
monsieur
simon
handed
her
gravely
down
and
monsieur
matthieu
led
the
way
up
the
stair
to
the
studio
where
a
policeman
was
still
on
guard
moira
followed
the
closely
and
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
while
monsieur
matthieu
unbent
enough
to
show
her
where
the
body
lay
and
to
indicate
the
locked
door
and
the
chair
which
had
been
overturned
to
moira
these
matters
were
already
unimportant
since
she
saw
no
reason
to
deny
the
testimony
of
the
many
witnesses
on
these
points
she
entered
the
room
slowly
with
a
feeling
of
some
awe
and
for
a
moment
stood
by
the
fireplace
glancing
from
one
object
to
the
other
thinking
deeply
a
dark
stain
on
the
rug
just
before
her
gave
her
a
tremor
but
she
recovered
herself
immediately
and
walked
slowly
around
the
room
examining
each
object
as
though
she
had
never
seen
it
before
does
madame
wish
to
look
in
the
apartment
or
the
kitchenette
she
heard
monsieur
matthieu
s
voice
asking
but
she
shook
her
head
the
answer
to
the
mystery
lay
this
very
room
she
was
already
satisfied
as
to
that
is
this
room
in
the
precise
condition
in
which
it
was
found
when
the
police
first
arrived
she
asked
coolly
yes
madame
except
for
the
removal
of
the
body
nothing
has
been
disturbed
you
are
sure
of
this
i
am
madame
it
is
for
this
reason
that
a
policeman
has
been
always
on
guard
and
you
yourself
monsieur
have
moved
no
chair
no
madame
nothing
i
climbed
upon
the
couch
to
look
out
of
the
window
that
is
all
she
nodded
and
passed
around
the
lay
figure
which
she
was
regarding
with
a
new
interest
and
the
gray
drapery
on
the
shoulder
of
the
lay
say
it
has
not
been
touched
monsieur
matthieu
looked
up
with
a
smile
i
examined
the
figure
carefully
madame
i
may
have
raised
the
i
restored
it
as
i
found
it
then
things
are
not
precisely
as
they
were
she
said
keenly
no
madame
not
the
gray
drapery
said
matthieu
amusedly
you
did
not
touch
the
bolero
jacket
no
madame
nor
the
skirt
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
said
the
she
removed
the
hat
from
the
head
of
and
examined
it
minutely
then
took
off
the
head
itself
and
stared
into
the
painted
eyes
as
though
asking
the
mute
familiar
lips
a
question
and
then
suddenly
as
the
and
monsieur
simon
watched
curiously
it
is
a
pity
that
you
moved
the
draperies
monsieur
matthieu
she
said
slowly
why
madame
because
you
have
disturbed
the
dust
i
can
t
understand
i
was
away
for
a
week
some
dust
would
have
accumulated
upon
the
figure
has
been
touched
it
is
not
as
i
left
it
of
course
madame
i
made
a
thorough
and
what
did
you
learn
from
it
she
asked
quietly
monsieur
matthieu
glanced
at
her
once
and
then
shrugged
nothing
madame
a
lay
figure
is
a
lay
figure
true
said
moira
carelessly
but
the
found
himself
regarding
her
with
a
new
appraising
eye
what
did
she
mean
by
this
question
but
she
moved
past
him
quickly
as
though
with
a
definite
purpose
and
approached
the
north
window
which
of
these
sashes
was
unlocked
monsieur
the
one
to
the
right
madame
i
see
you
say
it
was
closed
but
not
fastened
that
is
correct
that
is
strange
why
madame
because
i
fastened
it
with
great
care
before
i
left
for
fontainebleau
you
are
sure
of
this
positive
it
has
an
awkward
catch
you
see
and
she
demonstrated
how
easily
it
came
unlatched
unless
pressed
firmly
down
monsieur
matthieu
came
forward
smiling
you
only
indicate
madame
that
it
will
slip
easily
out
of
place
moira
met
his
gaze
firmly
try
to
make
it
slip
monsieur
she
said
since
i
have
fastened
it
he
tried
by
shaking
the
window
but
the
catch
held
it
is
a
matter
of
little
moment
he
muttered
since
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
murderer
to
have
escaped
by
this
way
perhaps
said
moira
but
while
she
spoke
she
unlocked
the
catch
then
slipped
it
insecurely
into
place
and
stood
aside
studying
it
keenly
what
is
it
that
interests
you
madame
asked
the
d
the
catch
monsieur
she
replied
quietly
it
is
an
old
one
the
edges
are
worn
quite
smooth
and
just
then
as
a
breeze
came
from
without
the
french
window
swung
gently
open
monsieur
matthieu
started
back
a
pace
and
glanced
at
monsieur
simon
you
found
this
window
open
le
said
the
judge
that
is
true
replied
the
confidently
but
it
is
possible
that
monsieur
horton
may
have
disturbed
it
when
he
examined
it
before
the
murder
moira
turned
quickly
the
window
was
securely
locked
i
left
it
so
monsieur
horton
found
it
so
you
make
nothing
of
this
either
le
monsieur
matthieu
shook
his
head
and
pointed
toward
the
opening
my
answer
to
your
questions
madame
is
yonder
he
said
with
a
grin
explain
to
me
how
any
living
man
could
have
descended
from
that
window
and
i
will
surrender
to
you
my
position
and
my
reputation
as
de
moira
made
no
reply
she
had
climbed
upon
the
couch
and
was
already
half
out
of
the
window
examining
the
broad
ledge
outside
while
monsieur
simon
somewhat
alarmed
lest
she
should
lose
her
balance
had
caught
her
by
the
skirt
of
her
dress
be
careful
madame
he
warned
you
may
fall
have
no
fear
le
she
said
with
a
smile
but
she
had
lowered
herself
to
her
knees
upon
the
ledge
outside
and
clinging
to
the
jamb
of
the
window
was
carefully
examining
every
inch
of
the
sill
and
tin
gutter
monsieur
matthieu
inside
the
room
had
lighted
a
cigarette
and
was
puffing
at
it
contentedly
looking
on
with
an
amused
tolerance
at
the
solicitude
of
monsieur
simon
who
as
he
knew
was
more
easily
swayed
than
himself
from
the
paths
of
his
duty
by
a
pretty
face
or
a
ankle
through
the
panes
of
glass
he
saw
that
the
girl
had
bent
forward
at
the
edge
her
eyes
near
the
tin
gutter
the
fingers
of
one
hand
touching
the
edge
while
monsieur
simon
held
her
other
arm
and
besought
her
to
return
this
she
did
presently
standing
for
a
moment
upright
in
the
open
window
and
looking
down
at
them
intently
a
challenge
in
her
eyes
for
the
did
you
discover
anything
madame
he
asked
politely
enough
though
his
professional
manner
may
not
have
indicated
it
monsieur
matthieu
was
sorry
for
her
she
had
attempted
the
impossible
her
lover
was
doomed
but
she
was
the
fine
color
that
had
come
into
her
face
from
her
exertions
and
the
new
gleam
of
hope
that
had
come
into
her
but
her
effort
was
futile
so
futile
to
hope
to
find
clues
where
he
matthieu
had
failed
she
didn
t
reply
and
accepting
the
hand
which
the
gallant
d
offered
her
stepped
down
to
the
couch
and
so
to
the
floor
you
see
madame
ventured
the
more
kindly
that
it
would
be
quite
out
of
the
question
for
the
murderer
to
have
descended
from
the
window
i
have
never
thought
that
he
did
monsieur
said
moira
dryly
the
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
in
astonishment
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
sudden
assurance
in
her
tone
could
it
be
possible
that
this
girl
had
noted
something
that
he
had
overlooked
that
she
had
evolved
a
theory
out
of
some
intangible
bit
of
evidence
that
had
escaped
him
impossible
and
yet
curiously
enough
he
experienced
a
slight
feeling
of
uneasiness
which
might
have
been
discomfort
had
he
not
been
so
sure
of
himself
you
have
perhaps
happened
upon
something
that
has
escaped
my
eye
he
asked
frankly
i
do
not
know
what
your
eye
saw
or
what
it
did
not
see
monsieur
she
said
quietly
but
i
have
learned
nothing
to
make
me
change
my
opinions
as
to
this
crime
i
hope
that
you
will
be
able
to
confirm
them
said
the
if
there
is
anything
that
i
can
yes
monsieur
broke
in
moira
with
precision
if
le
juge
d
will
grant
permission
with
a
flash
of
her
eyes
at
monsieur
simon
i
would
be
obliged
if
you
will
summon
for
me
monsieur
joubert
or
any
others
in
the
building
who
followed
monsieur
horton
up
the
stair
she
glanced
at
monsieur
simon
who
bowed
his
head
in
agreement
by
all
means
said
the
judge
if
madame
has
reason
to
i
ask
it
le
not
as
a
favor
but
as
a
necessary
step
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
this
case
it
is
little
enough
go
monsieur
here
are
the
names
madame
toupin
will
direct
you
monsieur
matthieu
hesitated
he
did
not
wish
to
leave
the
room
something
had
happened
to
change
the
manner
of
this
woman
her
eyes
was
he
was
beginning
to
believe
that
after
all
you
will
please
go
at
once
monsieur
the
voice
of
the
judge
was
saying
madame
and
i
will
await
your
return
and
so
with
a
backward
glance
monsieur
matthieu
went
out
you
think
you
have
found
a
clue
madame
asked
monsieur
simon
with
an
air
of
encouragement
i
don
t
know
a
vain
one
but
you
are
friendly
you
shall
see
and
crossing
quickly
in
front
of
him
she
went
directly
to
the
lay
figure
and
examined
it
minutely
this
old
skirt
monsieur
as
you
will
observe
is
fastened
by
buttons
and
is
somewhat
twisted
to
one
side
yes
madame
this
was
the
first
thing
that
attracted
my
attention
but
one
button
holds
it
and
it
is
fastened
at
the
wrong
and
what
does
that
signify
merely
that
it
has
been
tampered
did
not
fasten
it
in
this
way
monsieur
she
said
positively
you
are
sure
monsieur
simon
was
now
as
eager
as
she
absolutely
i
am
a
leisurely
person
i
have
done
all
the
cleaning
in
this
studio
myself
i
am
careful
in
small
matters
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
have
fastened
these
buttons
as
you
see
them
you
he
paused
as
moira
unbuttoned
the
old
skirt
and
slipped
it
down
while
she
moved
eagerly
around
the
partially
disrobed
figure
monsieur
she
gasped
in
sudden
excitement
as
she
pointed
to
the
cotton
covering
of
the
mannikin
he
looked
where
she
pointed
and
saw
a
stain
of
dirt
and
dust
which
extended
the
full
length
of
the
thigh
what
does
it
mean
he
asked
the
lay
figure
has
been
moved
from
its
iron
and
even
so
but
she
had
fallen
on
her
knees
before
it
and
didn
t
even
hear
him
for
she
suddenly
bent
forward
with
a
little
cry
and
put
her
finger
into
a
small
tear
in
the
cotton
cloth
on
the
outside
of
the
right
calf
i
have
it
she
muttered
excitedly
as
though
half
to
herself
i
have
on
one
side
soiled
on
the
what
asked
simon
catching
the
fire
of
her
eagerness
the
hole
in
the
leg
monsieur
she
cried
don
t
you
see
a
piece
torn
out
against
some
rough
yes
and
here
is
the
cloth
that
was
torn
from
it
she
gasped
exhibiting
a
small
piece
of
cotton
cloth
you
see
it
fits
the
tear
exactly
simon
took
it
from
her
hands
and
scrutinized
it
through
his
glasses
the
torn
piece
was
of
the
same
material
as
the
cotton
skin
of
the
lay
figure
soiled
upon
one
side
and
clean
upon
the
other
where
did
you
find
this
piece
of
cotton
madame
he
asked
in
a
suppressed
tone
outside
the
below
a
torn
edge
of
the
tin
gutter
where
it
must
have
escaped
the
eyes
of
le
then
the
lay
figure
must
have
been
outside
on
the
exactly
outside
the
stain
of
dust
upon
the
leg
shows
how
it
but
the
skirt
and
the
jacket
were
first
removed
she
went
on
breathlessly
isn
t
it
obvious
otherwise
there
would
have
been
no
stain
of
dirt
upon
the
leg
there
is
no
mark
of
dirt
upon
them
quick
madame
the
and
with
his
own
hands
the
judge
helped
her
remove
the
spanish
jacket
taking
from
his
pocket
a
small
magnifying
glass
with
which
he
examined
the
figure
intently
by
the
armpits
monsieur
simon
it
is
there
the
hands
would
have
caught
simon
obeyed
while
moira
lifted
the
arms
there
s
something
he
muttered
softly
a
stain
broke
in
moira
quickly
i
can
see
it
with
the
naked
eye
it
was
a
faint
smudge
of
a
brownish
color
like
rust
the
print
of
a
finger
she
mumbled
it
shall
be
analyzed
it
looks
the
murderer
s
if
it
is
blood
yes
then
the
murderer
carried
this
figure
the
exactly
and
she
paused
and
then
was
suddenly
silent
for
monsieur
matthieu
the
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
studio
he
came
quickly
forward
glancing
at
the
denuded
mannikin
in
the
absurd
pose
of
gesticulation
into
which
they
had
put
it
it
seemed
to
be
making
a
ribald
gesture
at
the
astonished
you
have
left
nothing
to
the
imagination
i
see
madame
and
then
you
have
discovered
something
he
asked
perhaps
said
moira
briefly
you
have
been
able
to
find
some
of
the
witnesses
yes
madame
the
most
important
but
it
would
give
me
pleasure
to
in
a
moment
monsieur
i
am
intent
upon
this
problem
perhaps
we
shall
learn
something
it
is
monsieur
joubert
that
i
wished
to
see
particularly
he
is
a
carpenter
and
lives
in
the
court
at
the
it
is
he
i
have
found
madame
and
turning
aside
matthieu
beckoned
toward
the
corridor
and
monsieur
joubert
entered
he
was
well
known
to
moira
and
saluted
her
his
brow
troubled
monsieur
joubert
she
said
trying
to
control
the
beating
of
her
heart
and
the
labor
of
her
breathing
for
here
she
knew
was
to
be
the
test
of
the
worth
of
her
discoveries
everything
that
she
believed
would
stand
or
fall
by
the
testimony
of
the
people
who
had
followed
jim
horton
up
the
stair
madame
orton
said
the
carpenter
politely
where
were
you
monsieur
she
began
when
you
heard
monsieur
horton
s
cry
of
alarm
in
the
court
below
madame
i
was
standing
with
monsieur
lavaud
the
pastry
cook
at
the
angle
of
the
wall
just
inside
the
of
madame
and
when
you
heard
the
cries
what
did
you
do
asked
the
girl
i
waited
a
moment
in
fear
and
then
with
monsieur
lavaud
went
toward
the
entrance
were
there
some
others
there
a
number
of
persons
came
running
into
the
court
they
seemed
to
spring
from
the
earth
as
if
by
magic
and
were
you
among
the
first
to
rush
up
the
stair
there
were
but
two
or
three
before
me
and
whom
did
you
find
on
the
second
landing
monsieur
orton
and
a
lady
who
told
us
that
a
murder
had
been
committed
and
you
went
with
him
up
the
stair
yes
monsieur
a
policeman
had
come
rushing
in
and
we
all
mounted
to
the
third
floor
was
it
dark
out
there
on
the
third
floor
landing
not
dark
but
dim
the
studio
door
was
open
and
threw
a
light
outside
and
what
did
you
do
then
some
rushed
into
the
studio
we
were
all
greatly
excited
i
stood
in
the
hallway
some
went
to
the
small
hall
room
the
door
of
which
was
partly
open
it
was
dark
inside
the
hall
room
you
have
testified
that
one
of
the
crowd
went
into
the
small
hall
room
and
came
out
saying
that
no
one
was
there
no
one
was
there
i
and
monsieur
lavaud
went
into
the
room
made
a
light
and
verified
the
statement
of
the
man
who
had
come
out
moira
clasped
and
unclasped
her
hands
nervously
and
when
she
spoke
again
her
throat
was
dry
with
uncertainty
monsieur
joubert
you
will
please
listen
very
carefully
to
my
question
and
try
to
answer
very
accurately
you
say
that
one
of
the
crowd
who
had
come
up
the
stair
with
you
examined
the
room
did
you
see
him
come
out
of
the
door
i
saw
him
come
out
she
paused
significantly
and
then
with
emphasis
did
you
see
him
monsieur
joubert
joubert
stared
at
her
stupidly
for
a
moment
and
monsieur
matthieu
and
the
judge
leaned
forward
aware
of
the
intent
of
the
question
as
the
man
did
not
reply
it
was
the
d
who
broke
the
silence
impatiently
yes
yes
monsieur
joubert
he
questioned
sharply
you
see
him
go
in
the
joubert
gasped
moira
joubert
scratched
his
head
and
snuffled
his
feet
awkwardly
no
madame
i
can
t
really
say
that
i
did
did
any
of
the
others
see
him
go
in
here
monsieur
simon
broke
in
quietly
pardon
madame
but
that
is
a
question
the
other
witnesses
must
answer
moira
glanced
at
him
and
then
at
monsieur
matthieu
perhaps
you
can
inform
me
le
she
said
have
any
of
the
witnesses
who
testified
to
seeing
this
man
come
out
of
the
door
also
testified
to
seeing
him
go
in
many
persons
went
into
the
room
monsieur
she
broke
in
quickly
after
this
man
who
had
come
out
had
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
gone
down
the
stair
monsieur
matthieu
started
madame
he
gasped
listen
monsieur
joubert
she
went
on
earnestly
and
answer
me
truthfully
for
the
life
of
a
human
being
hangs
on
your
replies
did
you
know
some
of
the
people
in
the
crowd
who
rushed
up
the
stair
as
to
said
joubert
more
easily
most
of
them
i
are
of
the
neighborhood
monsieur
lavaud
monsieur
picard
of
the
monsieur
gabriel
and
but
this
man
who
came
out
of
the
door
of
the
hall
room
she
insisted
clearly
you
had
never
seen
him
before
joubert
shrugged
now
that
you
mention
it
madame
i
think
that
is
the
truth
are
you
sure
that
you
never
saw
him
in
the
neighborhood
no
madame
i
never
saw
him
in
this
neighborhood
moira
gasped
in
relief
aware
that
the
from
contempt
from
indifference
had
been
reduced
to
the
silence
of
consternation
she
saw
it
in
his
face
and
in
the
eyes
of
monsieur
simon
who
stood
beside
her
listening
in
admiration
and
ready
to
aid
her
with
advice
or
question
he
was
on
her
side
now
but
she
was
reserving
her
strongest
stroke
for
the
last
and
she
delivered
it
with
growing
assurance
for
in
her
heart
all
along
she
had
known
through
whom
and
by
whom
the
murder
must
have
been
committed
monsieur
joubert
she
asked
coolly
you
say
the
light
was
dim
in
the
corridor
was
it
too
dark
for
you
to
see
what
the
man
who
came
out
of
the
door
looked
like
it
was
dim
madame
but
i
remember
him
perfectly
you
could
identify
him
if
you
saw
him
i
think
so
madame
good
perhaps
i
can
describe
him
to
you
monsieur
joubert
he
was
not
a
large
man
he
was
smaller
than
you
with
broad
but
bent
shoulders
long
arms
like
an
ape
s
which
reached
nearly
to
his
knees
a
thin
face
small
black
eyes
a
nose
like
the
beak
of
an
joubert
had
started
back
in
astonishment
it
is
he
madame
you
have
described
and
when
he
walked
he
had
a
slight
limp
of
the
left
a
limp
madame
it
is
true
cried
joubert
the
very
same
he
limped
i
saw
it
as
he
came
that
will
be
all
monsieur
joubert
said
moira
wearily
and
when
the
man
had
gone
out
she
turned
to
monsieur
simon
with
a
smile
of
triumph
have
i
made
out
a
case
le
but
the
he
urged
she
grew
grave
at
once
the
man
i
have
described
is
monsieur
tricot
the
two
men
exchanged
glances
we
have
already
taken
steps
he
will
be
found
madame
said
the
all
the
police
of
paris
are
on
his
trail
i
pray
god
you
may
find
him
said
moira
quietly
and
even
if
we
do
not
madame
said
monsieur
simon
you
have
created
already
a
reasonable
doubt
and
then
with
a
mischievous
look
toward
monsieur
matthieu
but
i
think
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
if
you
took
le
into
your
confidence
monsieur
matthieu
aware
of
the
position
the
d
had
now
taken
was
silent
but
still
incredulous
i
should
like
to
hear
the
other
facts
upon
which
you
base
this
testimony
he
said
slowly
monsieur
simon
waved
his
hand
toward
the
mannikin
its
frozen
gesture
now
almost
prophetic
tell
le
what
happened
in
this
room
as
you
have
traced
it
madame
moira
glanced
at
the
who
bowed
his
head
in
an
attitude
of
attention
which
had
in
it
not
a
little
of
humility
the
murderer
lay
in
wait
for
monsieur
jim
horton
said
moira
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
that
the
was
the
lure
this
studio
the
trap
the
affair
had
been
planned
with
skill
the
motive
was
vengeance
and
a
desire
to
prevent
certain
papers
from
reaching
the
hands
of
monsieur
le
duc
de
vautrin
this
man
tricot
was
already
in
the
studio
when
monsieur
horton
and
madame
morin
arrived
perhaps
le
has
already
guessed
where
go
on
madame
said
matthieu
gravely
he
had
taken
the
clothing
from
the
mannikin
and
put
the
lay
figure
out
in
the
darkness
on
the
ledge
outside
the
north
window
then
he
went
and
stood
in
the
place
of
the
lay
figure
he
had
put
on
the
old
skirt
and
bolero
jacket
and
slouch
hat
and
about
his
shoulders
was
the
gray
drapery
he
had
only
to
remain
silent
and
motionless
he
was
prepared
to
spring
upon
and
stab
monsieur
jim
horton
when
his
back
was
turned
but
the
appearance
of
madame
morin
disconcerted
him
he
had
counted
on
a
quick
death
without
an
outcry
madame
morin
knew
him
he
did
not
dare
to
attempt
to
kill
them
both
and
so
he
waited
monsieur
horton
and
madame
morin
examined
the
studio
in
curiosity
and
then
went
out
into
the
hall
now
suspicious
that
all
was
not
as
it
should
be
monsieur
tricot
did
not
dare
to
go
until
he
was
sure
that
they
had
gone
he
was
about
to
take
his
leave
when
he
heard
a
man
s
footsteps
upon
the
stair
and
went
back
to
his
position
on
the
model
stand
the
man
entered
he
thought
that
it
was
monsieur
jim
horton
come
back
alone
but
it
was
not
jim
horton
it
was
my
husband
harry
horton
his
twin
brother
the
testimony
shows
that
their
clothing
was
much
alike
their
faces
were
the
same
tricot
saw
my
husband
s
face
for
a
moment
under
the
low
gas
light
as
he
came
in
the
door
locking
it
behind
him
god
knows
why
husband
was
here
i
don
t
he
came
to
spend
the
night
wait
for
me
she
paused
breathing
hard
her
words
scarcely
audible
but
a
word
from
monsieur
simon
encouraged
her
again
this
tricot
is
desperate
and
very
strong
he
sprang
upon
my
husband
and
killed
him
but
there
was
a
sound
of
struggle
and
the
noise
of
a
falling
body
which
monsieur
jim
horton
and
his
companion
heard
from
the
door
of
the
room
in
the
hall
they
came
out
and
weapon
in
hand
jim
horton
after
several
minutes
broke
in
the
door
but
by
this
time
the
murderer
had
taken
his
place
again
as
the
lay
figure
just
as
he
stood
when
they
had
first
entered
the
room
in
their
horror
at
their
discovery
they
passed
him
by
and
rushed
down
the
stair
and
then
madame
nodded
the
commissaire
he
ran
quickly
to
the
window
outside
which
he
had
put
my
lay
figure
dragged
it
in
hurriedly
dressed
it
in
its
clothing
and
restored
it
to
its
place
then
ran
out
and
hid
in
the
darkness
of
the
hall
room
intending
to
leap
out
to
the
roof
below
but
he
did
not
dare
it
with
his
injured
leg
resorting
to
the
clever
device
which
i
have
indicated
to
you
of
going
out
when
the
crowd
swarmed
excitedly
up
to
the
studio
door
and
announcing
that
no
one
was
there
then
messieurs
in
a
moment
he
had
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
was
gone
and
how
did
you
learn
this
madame
by
a
trifle
which
even
your
experienced
eyes
had
overlooked
this
and
she
produced
the
small
piece
of
torn
cotton
cloth
from
her
pocket
it
was
torn
from
the
mannikin
upon
a
projecting
piece
of
tin
and
hung
from
the
gutter
outside
you
have
only
to
apply
it
to
the
leg
of
the
mannikin
le
the
bewildered
police
officer
took
the
small
object
and
turned
it
over
in
his
fingers
then
went
to
the
lay
figure
while
monsieur
simon
showed
him
the
stains
at
the
arm
pits
and
upon
the
thigh
explaining
the
line
of
reasoning
the
girl
had
employed
he
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
her
but
his
voice
was
that
of
a
broken
man
my
reputation
are
in
your
keeping
madame
he
muttered
but
moira
caught
him
by
the
hands
in
an
access
of
generosity
i
render
them
to
you
monsieur
if
le
keeps
silent
you
may
be
sure
that
i
shall
do
so
you
are
very
good
it
is
not
your
fault
you
were
not
familiar
with
the
studio
as
i
was
and
were
doing
your
duty
while
was
my
life
my
whole
happiness
that
was
involved
and
what
can
i
do
to
repay
you
madame
he
asked
find
monsieur
tricot
she
cried
with
spirit
and
monsieur
quinlevin
asked
the
judge
quietly
moira
glanced
at
them
then
sank
upon
the
couch
and
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
but
she
did
not
reply
she
could
not
she
had
reached
the
end
of
her
resources
monsieur
simon
bent
over
and
touched
her
kindly
on
the
shoulder
you
had
better
be
going
and
getting
some
rest
madame
if
you
will
permit
me
i
am
sure
that
madame
simon
will
be
glad
if
you
will
let
me
bring
you
to
her
moira
looked
up
at
the
dark
stain
upon
the
floor
the
terrible
mannikin
and
then
rose
there
were
tears
in
her
voice
as
she
gave
the
d
her
hand
in
gratitude
ah
thanks
monsieur
you
are
very
kind
if
it
will
not
trouble
and
leaving
the
theater
of
her
life
s
drama
to
the
solitary
policeman
on
guard
she
followed
the
charitable
monsieur
simon
down
the
stair
monsieur
matthieu
had
already
disappeared
jim
horton
passed
the
night
pacing
the
floor
of
his
prison
and
his
interrogation
by
monsieur
simon
the
d
with
the
assistance
of
the
de
in
the
morning
gave
him
little
hope
of
release
the
examination
was
severe
but
his
inquisitors
had
not
been
able
of
course
to
shake
his
testimony
and
had
left
his
cell
more
puzzled
than
when
they
had
entered
it
but
he
had
sense
enough
to
see
that
unless
it
were
proven
possible
for
some
one
to
have
been
in
the
studio
to
commit
the
murder
all
the
evidence
must
point
to
him
and
yet
he
could
not
help
them
nor
could
he
suggest
a
line
of
investigation
he
was
still
completely
in
the
dark
about
the
whole
tragic
affair
and
could
scarcely
blame
them
for
their
uncompromising
attitude
toward
poor
her
also
he
sat
upon
the
edge
of
his
cot
for
hours
after
the
examination
his
head
in
his
hands
trying
to
evolve
some
possible
explanation
of
the
mystery
a
more
encouraging
affair
was
the
visit
in
the
late
afternoon
of
a
captain
of
the
regular
army
of
the
united
states
representing
the
judge
advocate
general
s
office
who
interviewed
him
in
the
presence
of
an
officer
of
the
de
and
in
the
course
of
this
investigation
jim
horton
learned
of
harry
s
second
defection
from
the
army
which
had
resulted
in
his
horrible
death
captain
waring
questioned
shrewdly
but
jim
horton
now
needed
no
encouragement
or
threat
to
reveal
the
whole
truth
for
whatever
happened
to
him
at
the
hands
of
the
de
he
knew
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
but
to
throw
himself
upon
the
mercy
of
the
army
officials
and
so
he
told
the
whole
story
from
the
moment
when
as
corporal
of
engineers
he
had
heard
the
infantry
major
s
instructions
to
his
brother
of
his
meeting
with
harry
of
his
effort
to
save
his
brother
s
name
and
position
by
attempting
to
carry
out
the
major
s
orders
the
changing
of
uniforms
the
fight
at
boissi√®re
wood
the
hospital
and
the
events
that
had
followed
in
paris
leaving
out
what
references
he
could
to
harry
s
wife
and
palliating
where
he
could
his
brother
s
offenses
against
the
military
law
from
sternness
he
saw
captain
waring
s
expression
change
to
interest
from
interest
to
sympathy
and
to
horton
s
surprise
when
the
officer
finished
taking
the
testimony
he
extended
his
hand
frankly
you
have
committed
a
military
offense
corporal
horton
but
your
story
has
impressed
me
it
can
be
easily
verified
i
will
do
what
i
can
for
you
at
headquarters
it
was
croix
de
you
see
thank
you
sir
said
jim
but
it
looks
as
though
i
m
in
a
bad
position
here
do
you
think
i
could
have
done
this
horrible
thing
sir
do
you
no
said
the
captain
but
sit
tight
corporal
i
think
you
ll
find
that
things
will
turn
out
all
right
what
did
the
man
mean
jim
horton
followed
his
neatly
fitting
uniform
out
of
the
cell
with
his
gaze
and
then
more
mystified
than
ever
at
this
mingling
of
good
fortune
and
bad
sank
again
upon
his
cot
to
try
and
think
it
out
but
he
was
no
sooner
seated
than
the
man
who
had
done
the
most
to
put
him
where
he
was
monsieur
matthieu
the
de
again
entered
the
cell
his
manner
during
the
examination
by
the
d
in
the
morning
had
been
s
ordeal
had
been
most
unpleasant
the
french
counterpart
of
what
he
had
heard
of
in
his
own
country
as
the
third
degree
but
monsieur
matthieu
s
ugly
face
was
now
almost
kindly
its
expression
quite
calm
and
while
horton
wondered
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
visit
the
explained
evidence
has
been
introduced
into
this
case
monsieur
which
somewhat
changes
its
complexion
ah
you
have
found
tricot
or
quinlevin
yet
monsieur
but
we
have
hopes
the
evidence
came
from
another
quarter
we
believe
that
the
committed
this
crime
horton
couldn
t
restrain
a
gasp
of
relief
it
is
only
what
i
told
you
monsieur
monsieur
matthieu
nodded
but
you
will
not
blame
us
for
not
accepting
with
some
reserve
the
testimony
of
a
person
in
your
position
who
has
testified
monsieur
madame
horton
and
in
a
few
words
he
described
the
line
of
procedure
which
had
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
the
part
the
lay
figure
had
played
in
the
tragedy
moira
had
come
to
the
rescue
eyes
it
seemed
had
been
keener
than
his
own
keener
even
than
those
of
this
veteran
detective
and
amazement
at
the
simplicity
of
the
device
and
the
ease
with
which
it
had
been
put
into
practice
made
him
dumb
it
is
always
so
monsieur
the
mysteries
which
seem
most
difficult
to
solve
are
always
the
simplest
in
conception
but
tricot
did
not
invent
this
crime
monsieur
the
is
shrewd
but
the
brain
that
conceived
this
i
believe
you
now
monsieur
but
i
m
afraid
that
he
will
not
be
easy
to
catch
he
was
at
fontainebleau
last
night
and
this
morning
it
was
his
alibi
when
my
men
reached
there
he
had
gone
and
tricot
it
is
as
to
tricot
that
i
wished
to
see
you
we
have
watched
the
house
in
the
rue
charron
every
haunt
of
men
of
his
type
is
under
observation
i
thought
perhaps
that
you
might
give
us
a
further
clue
√©mile
pochard
should
know
pochard
in
the
rue
arrest
he
may
good
monsieur
the
help
that
you
give
us
will
make
your
deliverance
the
more
speedy
i
know
nothing
more
you
understand
it
is
not
possible
to
release
you
until
the
evidence
is
more
definitely
confirmed
but
i
will
do
what
i
can
for
your
comfort
and
convenience
thanks
and
for
madame
morin
yes
monsieur
she
is
i
think
now
quite
contented
and
the
departed
as
rapidly
as
he
had
entered
presently
jim
horton
lay
down
at
full
length
on
his
first
time
since
he
had
been
shown
into
the
cell
everything
would
be
right
he
knew
it
and
it
was
moira
who
had
come
from
her
retreat
at
the
first
news
of
his
trouble
and
piquette
s
to
help
them
behind
the
reserve
of
monsieur
matthieu
s
disclosures
he
had
read
that
it
was
moira
s
intelligence
that
had
been
matched
against
that
of
the
and
barry
quinlevin
her
faith
in
him
that
had
drawn
her
unerringly
to
the
neglected
clues
where
was
she
would
she
come
to
him
now
or
was
the
hypnotic
spell
of
barry
quinlevin
still
upon
her
he
stared
into
the
darkness
thinking
of
the
tragedy
of
moira
s
life
and
the
greater
tragedy
of
his
brother
harry
s
but
in
spite
of
the
terrible
climax
of
harry
s
strange
career
and
his
own
unwitting
part
in
it
jim
horton
found
himself
repeating
moira
s
wild
words
no
and
this
was
the
divorce
that
neither
of
them
had
wished
for
nor
dreamed
of
but
destiny
which
had
woven
the
threads
of
harry
s
life
and
moira
s
and
his
together
for
awhile
had
destroyed
the
imperfect
begin
anew
in
a
while
jim
horton
slept
soundly
dreamlessly
the
morning
dragged
heavily
and
no
one
came
to
his
cell
it
almost
seemed
that
monsieur
matthieu
had
forgotten
him
and
it
was
not
until
the
afternoon
that
he
was
again
conducted
to
the
room
in
which
his
examination
and
piquette
s
had
taken
place
there
he
was
brought
face
to
face
with
the
d
who
shook
him
by
the
hand
and
informed
him
that
word
had
just
been
received
that
the
tricot
had
been
captured
and
in
charge
of
monsieur
matthieu
was
to
be
brought
at
once
to
confront
the
witnesses
monsieur
simon
informed
him
that
a
partial
confession
having
been
extracted
from
tricot
the
case
was
simplified
and
that
there
seemed
little
doubt
that
he
would
be
restored
to
freedom
in
a
few
hours
while
disposing
of
some
other
cases
monsieur
matthieu
showed
the
prisoner
into
the
inner
room
where
piquette
had
preceded
him
they
were
both
still
technically
prisoners
but
that
did
not
prevent
piquette
from
springing
up
from
beside
her
guard
and
rushing
to
meet
him
oh
jeem
she
cried
joyfully
i
knew
it
could
not
be
for
long

cellar

she
made
a
queer
little
sound
of
repulsion
in
her
throat
and
quinlevin
escape
dey
can
not
find
him
he
sat
beside
her
and
they
talked
while
they
waited
what
are
you
going
to
do
piquette
he
asked
after
awhile
do
jus
go
on
living

replied
calmly

harshly

then
as
she
saw
the
look
of
pain
in

eyes
she
caught

by
the
arm
again

of

i
s
all

free
at
this
moment
monsieur
simon
entered
bringing
no
less
a
personage
than
monsieur
de
vautrin
who
had
been
apprehended
as
a
witness
the
moment
he
had
returned
to
paris
and
the
details
of
the
affair
at
nice
having
been
set
down
monsieur
simon
went
out
to
question
tricot
who
had
just
been
brought
in
under
heavy
guard
the
birth
certificate
and
other
papers
were
still
in
possession
of
the
d
but
the
duc
had
been
permitted
to
examine
them
and
questioned
horton
and
piquette
eagerly
as
to
what
had
happened
after
his
departure
from
nice
and
when
he
learned
the
facts
his
gratitude
expressed
itself
in
a
desire
to
kiss
horton
on
both
cheeks
which
piquette
only
frustrated
by
quickly
interposing
her
small
person
and
i
olivier
she
asked
in
french
with
a
spirit
of
what
is
my
reward
for
helping
in
the
great
affair
you
piquette
he
laughed
you
are
as
ever
my
angelic
child
who
can
do
no
wrong
come
to
my
arms
but
piquette
laughed
and
tossed
her
chin
and
if
i
refuse
then
you
are
still
an
angelic
child
said
de
vautrin
i
shall
give
you
money
and
if
i
refuse
that
too
she
asked
he
started
a
pace
back
from
her
in
amazement
you
would
desert
me
now
piquette
s
face
grew
suddenly
solemn
yes
le
we
shall
make
no
more
pretenses
you
and
i
go
back
to
the
where
i
am
free
perhaps
one
day
i
shall
marry
then
you
shall
give
me
a
present
but
and
she
extended
a
hand
mon
he
glanced
at
her
and
at
horton
as
though
unwilling
to
believe
what
he
had
heard
then
took
a
pace
toward
piquette
his
arms
extended
but
she
only
smiled
at
him
est
fini
she
said
quietly
de
vautrin
pulled
at
his
long
mustache
and
laughing
turned
away
he
said
confidently
she
repeated
the
duc
stared
at
her
again
and
then
with
a
shrug
took
up
his
hat
and
stick
and
swaggered
out
of
the
room
piquette
whispered
horton
eagerly
do
you
mean
it
yes
she
returned
lightly
to
be
and
she
took
a
long
breath
while
she
gazed
past
him
out
of
the
big
window
into
the
sunshine
there
was
a
commotion
outside
and
they
turned
to
the
outer
door
as
two
policemen
entered
between
them
tricot
securely
manacled
and
followed
by
the
the
de
madame
toupin
moira
madame
simon
the
carpenter
paul
joubert
and
the
other
witnesses
whose
testimony
had
already
been
taken
moira
s
gaze
and
jim
horton
s
met
for
a
moment
full
of
meaning
for
them
both
and
then
she
turned
away
to
the
seat
beside
monsieur
simon
to
which
the
directed
her
she
was
very
pale
and
sat
for
a
while
with
eyes
downcast
during
the
preliminaries
which
led
to
the
confession
of
the
tricot
stood
with
bowed
head
listening
to
the
evidence
against
him
his
long
arms
hanging
from
his
bent
shoulders
his
thin
lips
compressed
his
small
eyes
concealed
by
the
frowning
thatch
of
his
dark
brows
he
was
surly
but
indifferent
as
to
his
fate
and
answered
the
questions
of
monsieur
simon
in
a
low
voice
but
distinctly
evading
nothing
his
identification
by
the
carpenter
joubert
and
two
others
as
the
man
who
had
emerged
from
the
room
in
the
hallway
when
the
crowd
had
surged
upon
the
upper
landing
caused
him
to
shrug
the
corroboration
of
madame
toupin
who
saw
him
leave
the
courtyard
after
the
murder
only
caused
him
to
shrug
again
i
did
he
growled
i
ve
confessed
what
s
the
use
silence
commanded
the
you
will
answer
only
when
questioned
are
these
two
persons
indicating
horton
and
piquette
the
ones
who
first
entered
the
studio
they
are
and
when
le
entered
the
studio
you
thought
he
was
his
indicating
jim
i
did
i
made
a
and
your
motive
for
this
crime
tricot
i
was
paid
he
muttered
how
much
five
thousand
francs
by
whom
tricot
paused
and
then
gasped
the
name
monsieur
quinlevin
do
you
know
where
monsieur
quinlevin
is
now
no
would
you
tell
if
you
knew
yes
have
you
anything
further
to
say
no
monsieur
simon
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
door
take
him
away
the
proof
is
now
complete
and
then
to
the
witnesses
you
will
hold
yourselves
in
readiness
to
attend
the
trial
and
rising
from
his
chair
at
the
head
of
the
table
he
came
over
to
jim
and
piquette
and
shook
them
warmly
by
the
hands
while
monsieur
matthieu
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
proceedings
quickly
followed
his
example
you
are
now
free
monsieur
morin
i
thank
you
both
in
the
name
of
justice
for
your
indulgence
and
apologize
for
the
inconvenience
that
has
been
caused
you
had
it
not
been
for
the
keenness
of
madame
horton
yonder
you
would
still
doubtless
have
been
languishing
in
your
cells
thanks
monsieur
said
horton
gravely
let
me
add
monsieur
horton
that
before
the
murderer
arrived
i
was
in
consultation
with
le
capitaine
of
the
office
of
the
judge
advocate
of
the
american
army
i
told
him
what
had
happened
in
the
case
and
he
informed
me
that
there
was
no
disposition
to
make
you
suffer
for
an
act
which
resulted
in
the
de
he
empowers
me
to
ask
only
for
your
parole
to
report
to
him
morning
at
ten
o
clock
to
comply
with
the
military
law
i
should
say
that
in
the
end
you
will
have
nothing
to
fear
thank
god
muttered
horton
half
to
himself
and
now
le
said
the
with
a
smile
madame
simon
madame
morin
perhaps
we
had
better
leave
monsieur
the
american
to
give
his
thanks
to
the
lady
who
has
helped
us
to
liberate
horton
turned
around
to
look
for
her
but
she
had
gone
the
others
were
already
filing
out
of
the
door
and
suddenly
jim
and
moira
found
themselves
silent
face
to
face
by
the
big
window
in
the
sunlight
amazed
at
the
sudden
termination
of
the
case
and
what
it
meant
to
them
their
glances
met
and
a
gentle
flush
stole
along
the
pallor
of
moira
s
face
suddenly
flooding
it
from
brow
to
chin
scarcely
daring
to
believe
this
evidence
of
his
happiness
jim
stared
at
her
awkwardly
and
then
took
a
pace
forward
moira
he
whispered
at
last
thank
god
she
murmured
he
took
her
in
his
arms
gently
as
though
she
were
a
child
and
held
her
silently
in
a
moment
of
wordless
communion
beyond
the
river
below
them
the
city
of
their
tribulations
murmured
as
before
but
to
them
it
held
a
note
of
solace
and
of
joy
you
did
this
he
said
at
last
something
stronger
than
i
jim
faith
and
charity
he
added
i
knew
that
i
must
succeed
she
went
on
quickly
i
was
driven
by
some
inward
force
which
gave
me
new
courage
and
strength
it
was
faith
jim
the
faith
in
you
that
my
blindness
had
lost
in
the
darkness
of
my
faith
that
i
found
again
i
had
to
succeed
where
others
had
failed
faith
gave
me
new
in
time
she
finished
with
a
gasp
you
never
believed
that
i
could
no
never
jim
she
broke
in
in
a
hushed
voice
not
for
a
moment
it
was
too
horrible
she
hid
her
eyes
with
a
hand
for
a
moment
as
though
to
blot
out
the
stain
of
the
thought
i
ve
wondered
why
they
didn
t
see
as
i
saw
it
s
like
a
that
afternoon
after
fontainebleau
i
hardly
seem
to
remember
why
i
did
i
did
it
seems
so
easy
now
that
it
s
done
i
only
know
that
i
prayed
again
and
triumph
he
muttered
she
drew
closer
into
his
arms
he
has
escaped
she
said
with
a
shudder
perhaps
it
is
best
did
you
find
he
began
but
she
broke
in
quickly
reading
his
thought
he
father
s
brother
nora
told
me
everything
you
ve
blamed
me
in
your
thoughts
no
yes
i
know
she
insisted
but
i
couldn
t
forget
the
long
years
of
his
i
knew
had
horror
of
it
i
ran
even
then
i
did
not
tell
them
everything
and
when
they
went
to
take
him
it
was
too
late
he
s
gone
you
poor
child
you
ve
i
wanted
to
go
to
you
night
when
they
came
to
the
studio
i
wanted
again
at
nice
but
i
was
afraid
jim
of
i
had
gone
to
you
then
our
love
had
been
so
sweet
a
thing
pure
and
beautiful
i
let
it
be
anything
else
i
had
never
known
what
love
was
before
i
am
afraid
she
whispered
but
not
now
dear
no
not
of
myself
or
of
you
only
afraid
that
it
s
all
a
i
ll
wake
up
imprisoned
by
vows
that
may
not
be
you
re
released
from
them
now
moira
he
said
soberly
yes
jim
and
you
ll
marry
me
dear
yes
jim
but
it
would
be
a
sin
for
us
to
be
too
happy
too
soon
i
can
be
you
won
t
be
needing
to
be
too
patient
jim
she
whispered
her
warm
lips
on
his
he
held
her
in
the
hollow
of
his
arm
where
she
was
meant
to
be
both
of
them
muttering
the
phrases
that
had
been
so
long
delayed
while
their
eyes
looked
down
toward
the
river
when
suddenly
jim
felt
the
girl
s
fingers
tighten
in
his
and
he
followed
the
direction
of
her
gaze
across
the
just
below
them
a
figure
passed
a
female
figure
in
a
heavy
coat
with
a
small
hat
that
they
both
recognized
set
rakishly
upon
a
dark
head
piquette
said
moira
jim
was
silent
and
they
watched
for
another
moment
piquette
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
bridge
and
then
raising
her
head
quickly
squared
her
shoulders
and
went
quickly
along
the
quai
toward
the
boulevard
saint
michel
where
she
was
engulfed
in
the
crowded
thoroughfare
end
