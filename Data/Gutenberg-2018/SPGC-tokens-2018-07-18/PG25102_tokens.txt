introduction
nobody
boy
published
in
france
under
the
title
sans
famille
has
become
justly
famous
as
one
of
the
supreme
juvenile
stories
of
the
world
in
the
midst
of
its
early
popularity
it
was
crowned
by
the
academy
as
one
of
the
masterpieces
of
french
literature
a
few
years
later
it
was
followed
by
en
famille
which
is
published
by

reading
for
young
and
old
parents
teachers
and
others
who
are
careful
to
have
children
read
inspiring
books
will
welcome
this
beautiful
story
of
hector
malot
as
among
the
best
for
them
to
recommend
such
digressions
in
the
original
as
do
not
belong
to
the
heart
of
the
story
have
been
eliminated
so
that
the
lost
boy
experiences
continue
as
the
undisturbed
interest
on
through
to
the
happy
conclusion
loyal
friendship
and
honest
conduct
are
the
vital
ideals
of
this

chapter
i
my
village
home
i
was
a
foundling
but
until
i
was
eight
years
of
age
i
thought
i
had
a
mother
like
other
children
for
when
i
cried
a
woman
held
me
tightly
in
her
arms
and
rocked
me
gently
until
my
tears
stopped
falling
i
never
got
into
bed
without
her
coming
to
kiss
me
and
when
the
december
winds
blew
the
icy
snow
against
the
window
panes
she
would
take
my
feet
between
her
hands
and
warm
them
while
she
sang
to
me
even
now
i
can
remember
the
song
she
used
to
sing
if
a
storm
came
on
while
i
was
out
minding
our
cow
she
would
run
down
the
lane
to
meet
me
and
cover
my
head
and
shoulders
with
her
cotton
skirt
so
that
i
should
not
get
wet
when
i
had
a
quarrel
with
one
of
the
village
boys
she
made
me
tell
her
all
about
it
and
she
would
talk
kindly
to
me
when
i
was
wrong
and
praise
me
when
i
was
in
the
right
by
these
and
many
other
things
by
the
way
she
spoke
to
me
and
looked
at
me
and
the
gentle
way
she
scolded
me
i
believed
that
she
was
my
mother
my
village
or
to
be
more
exact
the
village
where
i
was
brought
up
for
i
did
not
have
a
village
of
my
own
no
birthplace
any
more
than
i
had
a
father
or
mother
the
village
where
i
spent
my
childhood
was
called
chavanon
it
is
one
of
the
poorest
in
france
only
sections
of
the
land
could
be
cultivated
for
the
great
stretch
of
moors
was
covered
with
heather
and
broom
we
lived
in
a
little
house
down
by
the
brook
until
i
was
eight
years
of
age
i
had
never
seen
a
man
in
our
house
yet
my
adopted
mother
was
not
a
widow
but
her
husband
who
was
a
worked
in
paris
and
he
had
not
been
back
to
the
village
since
i
was
of
an
age
to
notice
what
was
going
on
around
me
occasionally
he
sent
news
by
some
companion
who
returned
to
the
village
for
there
were
many
of
the
peasants
who
were
employed
as
in
the
city
mother
barberin
the
man
would
say
your
husband
is
quite
well
and
he
told
me
to
tell
you
that
he
still
working
and
to
give
you
this
money
will
you
count
it
that
was
all
mother
barberin
was
satisfied
her
husband
was
well
and
he
had
work
because
barberin
was
away
from
home
it
must
not
be
thought
that
he
was
not
on
good
terms
with
his
wife
he
stayed
in
paris
because
his
work
kept
him
there
when
he
was
old
he
would
come
back
and
live
with
his
wife
on
the
money
that
he
had
saved
one
november
evening
a
man
stopped
at
our
gate
i
was
standing
on
the
doorstep
breaking
sticks
he
looked
over
the
top
bar
of
the
gate
and
called
to
me
to
know
if
mother
barberin
lived
there
i
shouted
yes
and
told
him
to
come
in
he
pushed
open
the
old
gate
and
came
slowly
up
to
the
house
i
had
never
seen
such
a
dirty
man
he
was
covered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
come
a
distance
on
bad
roads
upon
hearing
our
voices
mother
barberin
ran
out
i
brought
some
news
from
paris
said
the
man
something
in
the
man
tone
alarmed
mother
barberin
oh
dear
she
cried
wringing
her
hands
something
has
happened
to
jerome
yes
there
is
but
do
get
scared
he
been
hurt
but
he
ai
dead
but
maybe
he
be
deformed
i
used
to
share
a
room
with
him
and
as
i
was
coming
back
home
he
asked
me
to
give
you
the
message
i
ca
stop
as
i
got
several
miles
to
go
and
it
getting
late
but
mother
barberin
wanted
to
know
more
she
begged
him
to
stay
to
supper
the
roads
were
so
bad
and
they
did
say
that
wolves
had
been
seen
on
the
outskirts
of
the
wood
he
could
go
early
in
the
morning
would
he
stay
yes
he
would
he
sat
down
by
the
corner
of
the
fire
and
while
eating
his
supper
told
us
how
the
accident
had
occurred
barberin
had
been
terribly
hurt
by
a
falling
scaffold
and
as
he
had
had
no
business
to
be
in
that
particular
spot
the
builder
had
refused
to
pay
an
indemnity
poor
barberin
said
the
man
as
he
dried
the
legs
of
his
trousers
which
were
now
quite
stiff
under
the
coating
of
mud
he
got
no
luck
no
luck
some
chaps
would
get
a
mint
o
money
out
of
an
affair
like
this
but
your
man
wo
get
nothing
no
luck
he
said
again
in
such
a
sympathetic
tone
which
showed
plainly
that
he
for
one
would
willingly
have
the
life
half
crushed
out
of
his
body
if
he
could
get
a
pension
as
i
tell
him
he
ought
to
sue
that
builder
a
lawsuit
exclaimed
mother
barberin
that
costs
a
lot
of
money
yes
but
if
you
win
mother
barberin
wanted
to
start
off
to
paris
only
it
was
such
a
terrible
affair
the
journey
was
so
long
and
cost
so
much
the
next
morning
we
went
into
the
village
and
consulted
the
priest
he
advised
her
not
to
go
without
first
finding
out
if
she
could
be
of
any
use
he
wrote
to
the
hospital
where
they
had
taken
barberin
and
a
few
days
later
received
a
reply
saying
that
barberin
wife
was
not
to
go
but
that
she
could
send
a
certain
sum
of
money
to
her
husband
because
he
was
going
to
sue
the
builder
upon
whose
works
he
had
met
with
the
accident
days
and
weeks
passed
and
from
time
to
time
letters
came
asking
for
more
money
the
last
more
insistent
than
the
previous
ones
said
that
if
there
was
no
more
money
the
cow
must
be
sold
to
procure
the
sum
only
those
who
have
lived
in
the
country
with
the
peasants
know
what
distress
there
is
in
these
three
words
sell
the
cow
as
long
as
they
have
their
cow
in
the
shed
they
know
that
they
will
not
suffer
from
hunger
we
got
butter
from
ours
to
put
in
the
soup
and
milk
to
moisten
the
potatoes
we
lived
so
well
from
ours
that
until
the
time
of
which
i
write
i
had
hardly
ever
tasted
meat
but
our
cow
not
only
gave
us
nourishment
she
was
our
friend
some
people
imagine
that
a
cow
is
a
stupid
animal
it
is
not
so
a
cow
is
most
intelligent
when
we
spoke
to
ours
and
stroked
her
and
kissed
her
she
understood
us
and
with
her
big
round
eyes
which
looked
so
soft
she
knew
well
enough
how
to
make
us
know
what
she
wanted
and
what
she
did
not
want
in
fact
she
loved
us
and
we
loved
her
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
say
however
we
had
to
part
with
her
for
it
was
only
by
the
sale
of
the
cow
that
husband
would
be
satisfied
a
cattle
dealer
came
to
our
house
and
after
thoroughly
examining
rousette
all
the
time
shaking
his
head
and
saying
that
she
would
not
suit
him
at
all
he
could
never
sell
her
again
she
had
no
milk
she
made
bad
butter
he
ended
by
saying
that
he
would
take
her
but
only
out
of
kindness
because
mother
barberin
was
an
honest
good
woman
poor
rousette
as
though
she
knew
what
was
happening
refused
to
come
out
of
the
barn
and
began
to
bellow
go
in
at
the
back
of
her
and
chase
her
out
the
man
said
to
me
holding
out
a
whip
which
he
had
carried
hanging
round
his
neck
no
that
he
wo
cried
mother
taking
poor
rousette
by
the
loins
she
spoke
to
her
softly
there
my
beauty
come
come
along
then
rousette
could
not
resist
her
and
then
when
she
got
to
the
road
the
man
tied
her
up
behind
his
cart
and
his
horse
trotted
off
and
she
had
to
follow
we
went
back
to
the
house
but
for
a
long
time
we
could
hear
her
bellowing
no
more
milk
no
butter
in
the
morning
a
piece
of
bread
at
night
some
potatoes
with
salt
shrove
tuesday
happened
to
be
a
few
days
after
we
had
sold
the
cow
the
year
before
mother
barberin
had
made
a
feast
for
me
with
pancakes
and
apple
fritters
and
i
had
eaten
so
many
that
she
had
beamed
and
laughed
with
pleasure
but
now
we
had
no
rousette
to
give
us
milk
or
butter
so
there
would
be
no
shrove
tuesday
i
said
to
myself
sadly
but
mother
barberin
had
a
surprise
for
me
although
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
borrowing
she
had
asked
for
a
cup
of
milk
from
one
of
the
neighbors
a
piece
of
butter
from
another
and
when
i
got
home
about
midday
she
was
emptying
the
flour
into
a
big
earthenware
bowl
oh
i
said
going
up
to
her
flour
why
yes
she
said
smiling
it
flour
my
little
remi
beautiful
flour
see
what
lovely
flakes
it
makes
just
because
i
was
so
anxious
to
know
what
the
flour
was
for
i
did
not
dare
ask
and
besides
i
did
not
want
her
to
know
that
i
remembered
that
it
was
shrove
tuesday
for
fear
she
might
feel
unhappy
what
does
one
make
with
flour
she
asked
smiling
at
me
bread
what
else
pap
and
what
else
why
i
do
know
yes
you
know
only
as
you
are
a
good
little
boy
you
do
dare
say
you
know
that
is
pancake
day
and
because
you
think
we
any
butter
and
milk
you
do
dare
speak
is
that
so
eh
oh
mother
i
did
mean
that
pancake
day
should
be
so
bad
after
all
for
my
little
remi
look
in
that
bin
i
lifted
up
the
lid
quickly
and
saw
some
milk
butter
eggs
and
three
apples
give
me
the
eggs
she
said
while
i
break
them
you
peel
the
apples
while
i
cut
the
apples
into
slices
she
broke
the
eggs
into
the
flour
and
began
to
beat
the
mixture
adding
a
little
milk
from
time
to
time
when
the
paste
was
well
beaten
she
placed
the
big
earthenware
bowl
on
the
warm
cinders
for
it
was
not
until
supper
time
that
we
were
to
have
the
pancakes
and
fritters
i
must
say
frankly
that
it
was
a
very
long
day
and
more
than
once
i
lifted
up
the
cloth
that
she
had
thrown
over
the
bowl
you
make
the
paste
cold
she
cried
and
it
wo
rise
well
but
it
was
rising
well
little
bubbles
were
coming
up
on
the
top
and
the
eggs
and
milk
were
beginning
to
smell
good
go
and
chop
some
wood
mother
barberin
said
we
need
a
good
clear
fire
at
last
the
candle
was
lit
put
the
wood
on
the
fire
she
did
not
have
to
say
this
twice
i
had
been
waiting
impatiently
to
hear
these
words
soon
a
bright
flame
leaped
up
the
chimney
and
the
light
from
the
fire
lit
up
all
the
kitchen
then
mother
barberin
took
down
the
frying
pan
from
its
hook
and
placed
it
on
the
fire
give
me
the
butter
with
the
end
of
her
knife
she
slipped
a
piece
as
large
as
a
nut
into
the
pan
where
it
melted
and
spluttered
it
was
a
long
time
since
we
had
smelled
that
odor
how
good
that
butter
smelled
i
was
listening
to
it
fizzing
when
i
heard
footsteps
out
in
our
yard
whoever
could
be
coming
to
disturb
us
at
this
hour
a
neighbor
perhaps
to
ask
for
some
firewood
i
could
think
for
just
at
that
moment
mother
barberin
put
her
big
wooden
spoon
into
the
bowl
and
was
pouring
a
spoonful
of
the
paste
into
the
pan
and
it
was
not
the
moment
to
let
one
thoughts
wander
somebody
knocked
on
the
door
with
a
stick
then
it
was
flung
open
who
there
asked
mother
barberin
without
turning
round
a
man
had
come
in
by
the
bright
flame
which
lit
him
up
i
could
see
that
he
carried
a
big
stick
in
his
hand
so
you
having
a
feast
here
do
disturb
yourselves
he
said
roughly
oh
lord
cried
mother
barberin
putting
the
frying
pan
quickly
on
the
floor
is
it
you
jerome
then
taking
me
by
the
arm
she
dragged
me
towards
the
man
who
had
stopped
in
the
doorway
here
your
father
chapter
ii
my
adopted
father
mother
barberin
kissed
her
husband
i
was
about
to
do
the
same
when
he
put
out
his
stick
and
stopped
me
what
this
you
told
me
well
yes
but
it
is
true
because
ah
it
is
true
eh
he
stepped
towards
me
with
his
stick
raised
instinctively
i
shrunk
back
what
had
i
done
nothing
wrong
surely
i
was
only
going
to
kiss
him
i
looked
at
him
timidly
but
he
had
turned
from
me
and
was
speaking
to
mother
barberin
so
you
keeping
shrove
tuesday
he
said
i
glad
for
famished
what
have

for
supper

was
making
some
pancakes

apple
fritters

the
miles
that
i
have
i
have
anything

you
see
we
did
expect
you
what
nothing

for
supper
he
glanced
round
the
kitchen
there
some
butter
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
at
the
spot
where
the
bacon
used
to
hang
but
for
a
long
time
there
had
been
nothing
on
the
hook
only
a
few
ropes
of
onions
and
garlic
hung
from
the
beam
now
here
some
onions
he
said
knocking
a
rope
down
with
his
big
stick
with
four
or
five
onions
and
a
piece
of
butter
we
have
a
good
soup
take
out
the
pancakes
and
fry
the
onions
in
the
pan
take
the
pancakes
out
of
the
frying
pan
without
a
word
mother
barberin
hurried
to
do
what
her
husband
asked
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
by
the
corner
of
the
fireplace
i
had
not
dared
to
leave
the
place
where
his
stick
had
sent
me
leaning
against
the
table
i
looked
at
him
he
was
a
man
about
fifty
with
a
hard
face
and
rough
ways
his
head
leaned
a
little
bit
towards
his
right
shoulder
on
account
of
the
wound
he
had
received
and
this
deformity
gave
him
a
still
more
forbidding
aspect
mother
barberin
had
put
the
frying
pan
again
on
the
fire
is
it
with
a
little
bit
of
butter
like
that
you
going
to
try
and
make
a
soup
he
asked
thereupon
he
seized
the
plate
with
the
butter
and
threw
it
all
into
the
pan
no
more
butter
then
no
more
pancakes
at
any
other
moment
i
should
have
been
greatly
upset
at
this
catastrophe
but
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
pancakes
and
fritters
now
the
thought
that
was
uppermost
in
my
mind
was
that
this
man
who
seemed
so
cruel
was
my
father
my
father
absently
i
said
the
word
over
and
over
again
to
myself
i
had
never
thought
much
what
a
father
would
be
vaguely
i
had
imagined
him
to
be
a
sort
of
mother
with
a
big
voice
but
in
looking
at
this
one
who
had
fallen
from
heaven
i
felt
greatly
worried
and
frightened
i
had
wanted
to
kiss
him
and
he
had
pushed
me
away
with
his
stick
why
my
mother
had
never
pushed
me
away
when
i
went
to
kiss
her
on
the
contrary
she
always
took
me
in
her
arms
and
held
me
tight
instead
of
standing
there
as
though
you
made
of
wood
he
said
put
the
plates
on
the
table
i
nearly
fell
down
in
my
haste
to
obey
the
soup
was
made
mother
barberin
served
it
on
the
plates
then
leaving
the
big
chimney
corner
he
came
and
sat
down
and
commenced
to
eat
stopping
only
from
time
to
time
to
glance
at
me
i
felt
so
uncomfortable
that
i
could
not
eat
i
looked
at
him
also
but
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
then
i
turned
my
head
quickly
when
i
caught
his
eye
does
he
eat
more
than
that
usually
he
asked
suddenly
oh
yes
he
got
a
good
appetite
that
a
pity
he
does
seem
to
want
his
supper
now
though
mother
barberin
did
not
seem
to
want
to
talk
she
went
to
and
fro
waiting
on
her
husband
ai
you
hungry
no
well
then
go
to
bed
and
go
to
sleep
at
once
if
you
do
i
be
angry
my
mother
gave
me
a
look
which
told
me
to
obey
without
answering
but
there
was
no
occasion
for
this
warning
i
had
not
thought
of
saying
a
word
as
in
a
great
many
poor
homes
our
kitchen
was
also
the
bedroom
near
the
fireplace
were
all
the
things
for
the
meals
the
table
the
pots
and
pans
and
the
sideboard
at
the
other
end
was
the
bedroom
in
a
corner
stood
mother
barberin
big
bed
in
the
opposite
corner
in
a
little
alcove
was
my
bed
under
a
red
figured
curtain
i
hurriedly
undressed
and
got
into
bed
but
to
go
to
sleep
was
another
thing
i
was
terribly
worried
and
very
unhappy
how
could
this
man
be
my
father
and
if
he
was
why
did
he
treat
me
so
badly
with
my
nose
flattened
against
the
wall
i
tried
to
drive
these
thoughts
away
and
go
to
sleep
as
he
had
ordered
me
but
it
was
impossible
sleep
would
not
come
i
had
never
felt
so
wide
awake
after
a
time
i
could
not
say
how
long
i
heard
some
one
coming
over
to
my
bed
the
slow
step
was
heavy
and
dragged
so
i
knew
at
once
that
it
was
not
mother
barberin
i
felt
a
warm
breath
on
my
cheek
are
you
asleep
this
was
said
in
a
harsh
whisper
i
took
care
not
to
answer
for
the
terrible
words
i
be
angry
still
rang
in
my
ears
he
asleep
said
mother
barberin
the
moment
he
gets
into
bed
he
drops
off
you
can
talk
without
being
afraid
that
he
hear
i
ought
of
course
to
have
told
him
that
i
was
not
asleep
but
i
did
not
dare
i
had
been
ordered
to
go
to
sleep
i
was
not
yet
asleep
so
i
was
in
the
wrong
well
what
about
your
lawsuit
asked
mother
barberin
lost
it
the
judge
said
that
i
was
to
blame
for
being
under
the
scaffold
thereupon
he
banged
his
fist
on
the
table
and
began
to
swear
without
saying
anything
that
meant
anything
case
lost
he
went
on
after
a
moment
money
lost
all
gone
poverty
staring
us
in
the
face
and
as
though
that
is
enough
when
i
get
back
here
i
find
a
child
why
did
you
do
what
i
told
you
to
do
because
i
could
you
could
not
take
him
to
a
foundlings
home
a
woman
ca
give
up
a
little
mite
like
that
if
she
fed
it
with
her
own
milk
and
grown
to
love
it
it
not
your
child
well
i
wanted
to
do
what
you
told
me
but
just
at
that
very
moment
he
fell
ill
yes
then
i
could
take
him
to
that
place
he
might
have
died
but
when
he
got
better
well
he
did
get
better
all
at
once
after
that
sickness
another
came
he
coughed
so
it
would
have
made
your
heart
bleed
to
hear
him
poor
little
mite
our
little
nicolas
died
like
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
sent
him
to
the
foundlings
home
he
died
also
but
after
after
well
time
went
on
and
i
thought
that
as
i
put
off
going
i
put
it
off
a
bit
longer
how
old
is
he
now
eight
well
then
he
go
now
to
the
place
where
he
should
have
gone
sooner
and
he
wo
like
it
so
well
now
oh
jerome
you
ca
you
wo
do
that
wo
i
and
who
going
to
stop
me
do
you
think
we
can
keep
him
always
there
was
a
moment
silence
i
was
hardly
able
to
breathe
the
lump
in
my
throat
nearly
choked
me
after
a
time
mother
barberin
went
on
how
paris
has
changed
you
you
would
have
spoken
like
that
to
me
before
you
went
away
perhaps
not
but
if
paris
has
changed
me
it
also
pretty
near
killed
me
i
ca
work
now
we
got
no
money
the
cow
sold
when
we
have
enough
to
feed
ourselves
have
we
got
to
feed
a
child
that
belong
to
us
he
mine
he
no
more
yours
than
mine
besides
he
ai
a
country
boy
he
no
poor
man
child
he
a
delicate
morsel
no
arms
no
legs
he
the
prettiest
boy
in
the
village
i
do
say
he
ai
pretty
but
sturdy
no
do
you
think
you
can
make
a
working
man
out
of
a
chit
with
shoulders
like
his
he
a
city
child
and
there
no
place
for
city
children
here
i
tell
you
he
a
fine
boy
and
as
intelligent
and
cute
as
a
little
cat
and
he
got
a
good
heart
and
he
work
for
us
in
the
meantime
we
got
to
work
for
him
and
i
no
good
for
much
now
if
his
parents
claim
him
what
will
you
say
his
parents
has
he
got
any
parents
they
would
have
found
him
by
now
if
he
had
it
was
a
crazy
thing
for
me
to
think
that
his
parents
would
come
and
claim
him
some
day
and
pay
us
for
his
keep
i
was
a
fool
he
was
wrapped
up
in
fine
clothes
trimmed
with
lace
that
to
say
that
his
parents
were
going
to
hunt
for
him
besides
dead
perhaps
they
not
and
one
day
they
may
come
if
you
women
ai
obstinate
but
if
they
do
come
well
we
sent
him
to
the
home
but
we
said
enough
i
take
him
i
going
to
see
fran√ßois
now
i
be
back
in
an
hour
the
door
was
opened
and
closed
again
he
had
gone
then
i
quickly
sat
up
in
bed
and
began
to
call
to
mother
barberin
say
mamma
she
ran
over
to
my
bed
are
you
going
to
let
me
go
to
the
foundlings
home
no
my
little
remi
no
she
kissed
me
and
held
me
tight
in
her
arms
i
felt
better
after
that
and
my
tears
dried
on
my
cheeks
you
did
go
to
sleep
then
she
asked
softly
it
was
my
fault
i
not
scolding
you
you
heard
what
he
said
then
yes
you
not
my
mamma
but
he
is
my
father
the
last
words
i
had
said
in
a
different
tone
because
although
i
was
unhappy
at
learning
that
she
was
not
my
mother
i
was
glad
i
was
almost
proud
to
know
that
he
was
not
my
father
this
contradiction
of
my
feelings
betrayed
itself
in
my
voice
mother
barberin
did
not
appear
to
notice
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
told
you
the
truth
but
you
seemed
so
much
my
own
boy
that
i
could
tell
you
i
was
not
your
real
mother
you
heard
what
jerome
said
my
boy
he
found
you
one
day
in
a
street
in
paris
the
avenue
de
breuteuil
it
was
in
february
early
in
the
morning
he
was
going
to
work
when
he
heard
a
baby
cry
and
he
found
you
on
a
step
he
looked
about
to
call
some
one
and
as
he
did
so
a
man
came
out
from
behind
a
tree
and
ran
away
you
cried
so
loud
that
jerome
did
like
to
put
you
back
on
the
step
again
while
he
was
wondering
what
to
do
some
more
men
came
along
and
they
all
decided
that
they
take
you
to
the
police
station
you
would
stop
crying
poor
mite
you
must
have
been
cold
but
then
when
they
got
you
warm
at
the
station
house
you
still
cried
so
they
thought
you
were
hungry
and
they
got
you
some
milk
my
you
were
hungry
when
you
had
enough
they
undressed
you
and
held
you
before
the
fire
you
were
a
beautiful
pink
boy
and
all
dressed
in
lovely
clothes
the
lieutenant
wrote
down
a
description
of
the
clothes
and
where
you
were
found
and
said
that
he
should
have
to
send
you
to
the
home
unless
one
of
the
men
liked
to
take
charge
of
you
such
a
beautiful
fine
child
it
would
be
difficult
to
bring
up
he
said
and
the
parents
would
surely
make
a
search
for
it
and
pay
any
one
well
for
looking
after
it
so
jerome
said
he
take
it
just
at
that
time
i
had
a
baby
the
same
age
so
i
was
well
able
to
feed
both
you
two
mites
there
dearie
that
was
how
i
came
to
be
your
mother
oh
mamma
mamma
yes
dearie
there
and
at
the
end
of
three
months
i
lost
my
own
little
baby
and
then
i
got
even
more
fond
of
you
it
was
such
a
pity
jerome
could
forget
and
seeing
at
the
end
of
three
years
that
your
parents
had
come
after
you
he
tried
to
make
me
send
you
to
the
home
you
heard
why
i
did
do
as
he
told
me
oh
do
send
me
to
the
home
i
cried
clinging
to
her
mother
barberin
please
please
do
send
me
to
the
home
no
dearie
no
you
sha
go
i
settle
it
jerome
is
not
really
unkind
you
see
he
had
a
lot
of
trouble
and
he
is
kind
of
worried
about
the
future
we
all
work
you
shall
work
too
yes
yes
i
do
anything
you
want
me
to
do
but
do
send
me
to
the
home
you
sha
go
that
is
if
you
promise
to
go
to
sleep
at
once
when
he
returns
he
must
find
you
awake
she
kissed
me
and
turned
me
over
with
my
face
to
the
wall
i
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
but
i
had
received
too
hard
a
blow
to
slip
off
quietly
into
slumberland
dear
good
mother
barberin
was
not
my
own
mother
then
what
was
a
real
mother
something
better
something
sweeter
still
it
possible
then
i
thought
that
a
real
father
might
not
have
held
up
his
stick
to
me
he
wanted
to
send
me
to
the
home
would
mother
be
able
to
prevent
him
in
the
village
there
were
two
children
from
the
home
they
were
called
workhouse
children
they
had
a
metal
plaque
hung
round
their
necks
with
a
number
on
it
they
were
badly
dressed
and
so
dirty
all
the
other
children
made
fun
of
them
and
threw
stones
at
them
they
chased
them
like
boys
chase
a
lost
dog
for
fun
and
because
a
stray
dog
has
no
one
to
protect
it
oh
i
did
not
want
to
be
like
those
children
i
did
not
want
to
have
a
number
hung
round
my
neck
i
did
not
want
them
to
call
after
me
hi
workhouse
kid
hi
foundling
the
very
thought
of
it
made
me
feel
cold
and
my
teeth
chatter
i
could
not
go
to
sleep
and
barberin
was
coming
back
soon
but
fortunately
he
did
not
return
until
very
late
and
sleep
came
before
he
arrived
chapter
iii
signor
vitalis
company
that
night
i
dreamed
that
i
had
been
taken
to
the
home
when
i
opened
my
eyes
in
the
early
morning
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
i
was
still
there
in
my
little
bed
i
felt
the
bed
and
pinched
my
arms
to
see
if
it
were
true
ah
yes
i
was
still
with
mother
barberin
she
said
nothing
to
me
all
the
morning
and
i
began
to
think
that
they
had
given
up
the
idea
of
sending
me
away
perhaps
she
had
said
that
she
was
determined
to
keep
me
but
when
mid
day
came
barberin
told
me
to
put
on
my
cap
and
follow
him
i
looked
at
mother
barberin
to
implore
her
to
help
me
without
her
husband
noticing
she
made
me
a
sign
to
go
with
him
i
obeyed
she
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
as
i
passed
her
to
let
me
know
that
i
had
nothing
to
fear
without
a
word
i
followed
him
it
was
some
distance
from
our
house
to
the
village
a
good
hour
walk
barberin
never
said
a
word
to
me
the
whole
way
he
walked
along
limping
now
and
again
he
turned
to
see
if
i
was
following
where
was
he
taking
me
i
asked
myself
the
question
again
and
again
despite
the
reassuring
sign
that
mother
barberin
had
made
i
felt
that
something
was
going
to
happen
to
me
and
i
wanted
to
run
away
i
tried
to
lag
behind
thinking
that
i
would
jump
down
into
a
ditch
where
barberin
could
not
catch
me
at
first
he
had
seemed
satisfied
that
i
should
tramp
along
just
behind
him
on
his
heels
but
he
evidently
soon
began
to
suspect
what
i
intended
to
do
and
he
grabbed
me
by
the
wrist
i
was
forced
to
keep
up
with
him
this
was
the
way
we
entered
the
village
every
one
who
passed
us
turned
round
to
stare
for
i
looked
like
a
bad
dog
held
on
a
leash
as
we
were
about
to
pass
the
tavern
a
man
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
called
to
barberin
and
asked
him
to
go
in
barberin
took
me
by
the
ear
and
pushed
me
in
before
him
and
when
we
got
inside
he
closed
the
door
i
felt
relieved
this
was
only
the
village
tavern
and
for
a
long
time
i
had
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
inside
i
had
often
wondered
what
was
going
on
behind
the
red
curtains
i
was
going
to
know
now
barberin
sat
down
at
a
table
with
the
boss
who
had
asked
him
to
go
in
i
sat
by
the
fireplace
in
a
corner
near
me
there
was
a
tall
old
man
with
a
long
white
beard
he
wore
a
strange
costume
i
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
before
long
ringlets
fell
to
his
shoulders
and
he
wore
a
tall
gray
hat
ornamented
with
green
and
red
feathers
a
sheepskin
the
woolly
side
turned
inside
was
fastened
round
his
body
there
were
no
sleeves
to
the
skin
but
through
two
large
holes
cut
beneath
the
shoulders
his
arms
were
thrust
covered
with
velvet
sleeves
which
had
once
been
blue
in
color
woolen
gaiters
reached
up
to
his
knees
and
to
hold
them
in
place
a
ribbon
was
interlaced
several
times
round
his
legs
he
sat
with
his
elbow
resting
on
his
crossed
knees
i
had
never
seen
a
living
person
in
such
a
quiet
calm
attitude
he
looked
to
me
like
one
of
the
saints
in
our
church
lying
beside
him
were
three
dogs
a
white
spaniel
a
black
spaniel
and
a
pretty
little
gray
dog
with
a
sharp
cute
little
look
the
white
spaniel
wore
a
policeman
old
helmet
which
was
fastened
under
its
chin
with
a
leather
strap
while
i
stared
at
the
man
in
wonder
barberin
and
the
owner
of
the
tavern
talked
in
low
voices
i
knew
that
i
was
the
subject
of
their
talk
barberin
was
telling
him
that
he
had
brought
me
to
the
village
to
take
me
to
the
mayor
office
so
that
the
mayor
should
ask
the
charity
home
to
pay
for
my
keep
that
was
all
that
dear
mother
barberin
had
been
able
to
do
but
i
felt
that
if
barberin
could
get
something
for
keeping
me
i
had
nothing
to
fear
the
old
man
who
without
appearing
had
evidently
been
listening
suddenly
pointed
to
me
and
turning
to
barberin
said
with
a
marked
foreign
accent
is
that
the
child
that
in
your
way
that
him
and
you
think
the
home
is
going
to
pay
you
for
his
keep
lord
as
he
ai
got
no
parents
and
i
been
put
to
great
expense
for
him
it
is
only
right
that
the
town
should
pay
me
something
i
do
say
it
is
but
do
you
think
that
just
because
a
thing
is
right
it
done
that
no
well
then
i
do
think
you
ever
get
what
you
after
then
he
goes
to
the
home
there
no
law
that
forces
me
to
keep
him
in
my
place
if
i
do
want
to
you
agreed
in
the
beginning
to
take
him
so
it
up
to
you
to
keep
your
promise
well
i
ai
going
to
keep
him
and
when
i
want
to
turn
him
out
do
so
perhaps
there
a
way
to
get
rid
of
him
now
said
the
old
man
after
a
moment
thought
and
make
a
little
money
into
the
bargain
if
you
show
me
how
i
stand
a
drink
order
the
drinks
the
affair
settled
sure
sure
the
old
man
got
up
and
took
a
seat
opposite
barberin
a
strange
thing
as
he
rose
i
saw
his
sheepskin
move
it
was
lifted
up
and
i
wondered
if
he
had
another
dog
under
his
arm
what
were
they
going
to
do
with
me
my
heart
beat
against
my
side
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
the
old
man
you
wo
let
this
child
eat
any
more
of
your
bread
unless
somebody
pays
for
it
that
it
is
it
that
it
because
never
mind
the
reason
that
do
concern
me
now
if
you
do
want
him
just
give
him
to
me
i
take
charge
of
him
you
take
charge
of
him
you
want
to
get
rid
of
him
do
you
give
you
a
child
like
him
a
beautiful
boy
for
he
is
beautiful
the
prettiest
boy
in
the
village
look
at
him
i
looked
at
him
remi
come
here
i
went
over
to
the
table
my
knees
trembling
there
do
be
afraid
little
one
said
the
old
man
just
look
at
him
said
barberin
again
i
do
say
that
he
is
a
homely
child
if
he
was
i
would
want
him
i
do
want
a
monster
ah
now
if
he
was
a
monster
with
two
ears
or
even
a
dwarf
you
keep
him
you
could
make
your
fortune
out
of
a
monster
but
this
little
boy
is
not
a
dwarf
nor
a
monster
so
you
ca
exhibit
him
made
the
same
as
others
and
he
no
good
for
anything
he
good
for
work
he
not
strong
not
strong
him
land
sakes
he
as
strong
as
any
man
look
at
his
legs
they
that
solid
have
you
ever
seen
straighter
legs
than
his
barberin
pulled
up
my
pants
too
thin
said
the
old
man
and
his
arms
continued
barberin
like
his
legs
might
be
better
they
ca
hold
out
against
fatigue
and
poverty
what
them
legs
and
arms
feel
just
see
for
yourself
the
old
man
passed
his
skinny
hand
over
my
legs
and
felt
them
shaking
his
head
the
while
and
making
a
grimace
i
had
already
seen
a
similar
scene
enacted
when
the
cattle
dealer
came
to
buy
our
cow
he
also
had
felt
and
pinched
the
cow
he
also
had
shaken
his
head
and
said
that
it
was
not
a
good
cow
it
would
be
impossible
to
sell
it
again
and
yet
after
all
he
had
bought
it
and
taken
it
away
with
him
was
the
old
man
going
to
buy
me
and
take
me
away
with
him
oh
mother
barberin
mother
barberin
if
i
had
dared
i
would
have
said
that
only
the
night
before
barberin
had
reproached
me
for
seeming
delicate
and
having
thin
arms
and
legs
but
i
felt
that
i
should
gain
nothing
by
it
but
an
angry
word
so
i
kept
silent
for
a
long
time
they
wrangled
over
my
good
and
bad
points
well
such
as
he
is
said
the
old
man
at
last
i
take
him
but
mind
you
i
do
buy
him
outright
i
hire
him
i
give
you
twenty
francs
a
year
for
him
twenty
francs
that
a
good
sum
and
i
pay
in
advance
but
if
i
keep
him
the
town
will
pay
me
more
than
ten
francs
a
month
i
know
what
you
get
from
the
town
and
besides
you
got
to
feed
him
he
will
work
if
you
thought
that
he
could
work
you
would
be
so
anxious
to
get
rid
of
him
it
is
not
for
the
money
that
paid
for
their
keep
that
you
people
take
in
lost
children
it
for
the
work
that
you
can
get
out
of
them
you
make
servants
of
them
they
pay
you
and
they
themselves
get
no
wages
if
this
child
could
have
done
much
for
you
you
would
have
kept
him
anyway
i
should
always
have
ten
francs
a
month
and
if
the
home
instead
of
letting
you
have
him
gave
him
to
some
one
else
you
would
get
anything
at
all
now
with
me
you
wo
have
to
run
for
your
money
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
hold
out
your
hand
he
pulled
a
leather
purse
from
his
pocket
counting
out
four
silver
pieces
of
money
he
threw
them
down
on
the
table
making
them
ring
as
they
fell
but
think
cried
barberin
this
child
parents
will
show
up
one
day
or
the
other
what
does
that
matter
well
those
who
brought
him
up
will
get
something
if
i
thought
of
that
i
would
have
taken
him
in
the
first
place
oh
the
wicked
man
how
i
did
dislike
barberin
now
look
here
it
because
you
think
his
parents
wo
show
up
now
that
you
turning
him
out
said
the
old
man
well
if
by
any
chance
they
do
appear
they
go
straight
to
you
not
to
me
for
nobody
knows
me
but
if
it
you
who
finds
them
well
in
that
case
we
go
shares
and
i
put
thirty
down
for
him
now
make
it
forty
no
for
what
he
do
for
me
that
is
possible
what
do
you
want
him
to
do
for
you
for
good
legs
he
got
good
legs
for
good
arms
he
got
good
arms
i
hold
to
what
i
said
before
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
then
the
old
man
looked
at
barberin
mockingly
then
emptied
his
glass
slowly
he
just
to
keep
me
company
i
getting
old
and
at
night
i
get
a
bit
lonesome
when
one
is
tired
it
nice
to
have
a
child
around
well
for
that
i
sure
his
legs
are
strong
enough
oh
not
too
much
so
for
he
must
also
dance
and
jump
and
walk
and
then
walk
and
jump
again
he
take
his
place
in
signor
vitalis
traveling
company
where
this
company
i
am
signor
vitalis
and
i
show
you
the
company
right
here
with
this
he
opened
the
sheepskin
and
took
out
a
strange
animal
which
he
held
on
his
left
arm
pressed
against
his
chest
this
was
the
animal
that
had
several
times
raised
the
sheepskin
but
it
was
not
a
little
dog
as
i
had
thought
i
found
no
name
to
give
to
this
strange
creature
which
i
saw
for
the
first
time
i
looked
at
it
in
astonishment
it
was
dressed
in
a
red
coat
trimmed
with
gold
braid
but
its
arms
and
legs
were
bare
for
they
really
were
arms
and
legs
and
not
paws
but
they
were
covered
with
a
black
hairy
skin
they
were
not
white
or
pink
the
head
which
was
as
large
as
a
clenched
fist
was
wide
and
short
the
nose
had
spreading
nostrils
and
the
lips
were
yellow
but
what
struck
me
more
than
anything
were
the
two
eyes
close
to
each
other
which
glittered
like
glass
oh
the
ugly
monkey
cried
barberin
a
monkey
i
opened
my
eyes
still
wider
so
this
was
a
monkey
for
although
i
had
never
seen
a
monkey
i
had
heard
of
them
so
this
little
tiny
creature
that
looked
like
a
black
baby
was
a
monkey
this
is
the
star
of
my
company
said
signor
vitalis
this
is
now
turning
to
the
animal
make
your
bow
to
the
society
the
monkey
put
his
hand
to
his
lips
and
threw
a
kiss
to
each
of
us
now
continued
signor
vitalis
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
white
spaniel
the
next
signor
capi
will
have
the
honor
of
introducing
his
friends
to
the
esteemed
company
here
present
the
spaniel
who
up
till
this
moment
had
not
made
a
movement
jumped
up
quickly
and
standing
on
his
hind
paws
crossed
his
fore
paws
on
his
chest
and
bowed
to
his
master
so
low
that
his
police
helmet
touched
the
ground
this
polite
duty
accomplished
he
turned
to
his
companions
and
with
one
paw
still
pressed
on
his
chest
he
made
a
sign
with
the
other
for
them
to
draw
nearer
the
two
dogs
whose
eyes
had
been
fixed
on
the
white
spaniel
got
up
at
once
and
giving
each
one
of
us
his
paw
shook
hands
as
one
does
in
polite
society
and
then
taking
a
few
steps
back
bowed
to
us
in
turn
the
one
i
call
said
signor
vitalis
which
is
an
abbreviation
of
in
italian
is
the
chief
he
is
the
most
intelligent
and
he
conveys
my
orders
to
the
others
that
black
haired
young
dandy
is
signor
zerbino
which
signifies
sport
notice
him
and
i
am
sure
you
will
admit
that
the
name
is
very
appropriate
and
that
young
person
with
the
modest
air
is
miss
dulcie
she
is
english
and
her
name
is
chosen
on
account
of
her
sweet
disposition
with
these
remarkable
i
travel
through
the
country
earning
my
living
sometimes
good
sometimes
bad
it
is
a
matter
of
luck
capi
the
spaniel
crossed
his
paws
capi
come
here
and
be
on
your
best
behavior
these
people
are
well
brought
up
and
they
must
be
spoken
to
with
great
politeness
be
good
enough
to
tell
this
little
boy
who
is
looking
at
you
with
such
big
round
eyes
what
time
it
is
capi
uncrossed
his
paws
went
up
to
his
master
drew
aside
the
sheepskin
and
after
feeling
in
his
vest
pocket
pulled
out
a
large
silver
watch
he
looked
at
the
watch
for
a
moment
then
gave
two
distinct
barks
then
after
these
two
decisive
sharp
barks
he
uttered
three
little
barks
not
so
loud
nor
so
clear
the
hour
was
quarter
of
three
very
good
said
vitalis
thank
you
signor
capi
and
now
ask
miss
dulcie
to
oblige
us
by
dancing
with
the
skipping
rope
capi
again
felt
in
his
master
vest
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
cord
he
made
a
brief
sign
to
zerbino
who
immediately
took
his
position
opposite
to
him
then
capi
threw
him
one
end
of
the
cord
and
they
both
began
to
turn
it
very
gravely
then
dulcie
jumped
lightly
into
the
rope
and
with
her
beautiful
soft
eyes
fixed
on
her
master
began
to
skip
you
see
how
intelligent
they
are
said
vitalis
their
intelligence
would
be
even
more
appreciated
if
i
drew
comparisons
for
instance
if
i
had
a
fool
to
act
with
them
that
is
why
i
want
your
boy
he
is
to
be
the
fool
so
that
the
dogs
intelligence
will
stand
out
in
a
more
marked
manner
oh
he
to
be
the
fool
interrupted
barberin
it
takes
a
clever
man
to
play
the
fool
said
vitalis
the
boy
will
be
able
to
act
the
part
with
a
few
lessons
we
test
him
at
once
if
he
has
any
intelligence
he
will
understand
that
with
me
he
will
be
able
to
see
the
country
and
other
countries
besides
but
if
he
stays
here
all
he
can
do
is
to
drive
a
herd
of
cattle
in
the
same
fields
from
morning
to
night
if
he
has
any
intelligence
he
cry
and
stamp
his
feet
and
then
i
wo
take
him
with
me
and
he
be
sent
to
the
foundlings
home
where
he
have
to
work
hard
and
have
little
to
eat
i
had
enough
intelligence
to
know
this
the
dogs
were
very
funny
and
it
would
be
fun
to
be
with
them
always
but
mother
mother
barberin
i
could
not
leave
her
then
if
i
refused
perhaps
i
should
not
stay
with
mother
barberin
i
might
be
sent
to
the
home
i
was
very
unhappy
and
as
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
signor
vitalis
tapped
me
gently
on
the
cheek
ah
the
little
chap
understands
because
he
does
not
make
a
great
noise
he
is
arguing
the
matter
in
his
little
head
and
oh
sir
i
cried
let
me
stay
with
mother
barberin
please
let
me
stay
i
could
not
say
more
for
capi
loud
barking
interrupted
me
at
the
same
moment
the
dog
sprang
towards
the
table
upon
which
was
seated
the
monkey
profiting
by
the
moment
when
every
one
was
occupied
with
me
had
quickly
seized
his
master
glass
which
was
full
of
wine
and
was
about
to
empty
it
but
capi
who
was
a
good
watch
dog
had
seen
the
monkey
trick
and
like
the
faithful
servant
that
he
was
he
had
foiled
him
illustration
i
give
you
thirty
francs
for
him
said
vitalis
severely
you
are
a
glutton
and
a
thief
go
over
there
into
the
corner
and
turn
your
face
to
the
wall
and
you
zerbino
keep
guard
if
he
moves
give
him
a
good
slap
as
to
you
capi
you
are
a
good
dog
give
me
your
paw
i
like
to
shake
hands
with
you
the
monkey
uttering
little
stifled
cries
obeyed
and
went
into
the
corner
and
the
dog
proud
and
happy
held
out
his
paw
to
his
master
now
continued
vitalis
back
to
business
i
give
you
thirty
francs
for
him
then
no
forty
a
discussion
commenced
but
vitalis
soon
stopped
it
by
saying
this
does
interest
the
child
let
him
go
outside
and
play
at
the
same
time
he
made
a
sign
to
barberin
yes
go
out
into
the
yard
at
the
back
but
do
move
or
you
have
me
to
reckon
with
i
could
not
but
obey
i
went
into
the
yard
but
i
had
no
heart
to
play
i
sat
down
on
a
big
stone
and
waited
they
were
deciding
what
was
to
become
of
me
what
would
it
be
they
talked
for
a
long
time
i
sat
waiting
and
it
was
an
hour
later
when
barberin
came
out
into
the
yard
he
was
alone
had
he
come
to
fetch
me
to
hand
me
over
to
vitalis
come
he
said
back
home
home
then
i
was
not
to
leave
mother
barberin
i
wanted
to
ask
questions
but
i
was
afraid
because
he
seemed
in
a
very
bad
temper
we
walked
all
the
way
home
in
silence
but
just
before
we
arrived
home
barberin
who
was
walking
ahead
stopped
you
know
he
said
taking
me
roughly
by
the
ear
if
you
say
one
single
word
of
what
you
have
heard
you
shall
smart
for
it
understand
chapter
iv
the
maternal
house
well
asked
mother
barberin
when
we
entered
what
did
the
mayor
say
we
did
see
him
how
you
did
see
him
no
i
met
some
friends
at
the
caf√©
and
when
we
came
out
it
was
too
late
so
we
go
back
so
barberin
had
given
up
the
idea
of
driving
a
bargain
with
the
man
with
the
dogs
on
the
way
home
i
wondered
if
this
was
not
some
trick
of
his
returning
to
the
house
but
his
last
words
drove
all
my
doubts
away
as
we
had
to
go
back
to
the
village
the
next
day
to
see
the
mayor
it
was
certain
that
barberin
had
not
accepted
vitalis
terms
but
in
spite
of
his
threats
i
would
have
spoken
of
my
fears
to
mother
barberin
if
i
could
have
found
myself
alone
for
one
moment
with
her
but
all
the
evening
barberin
did
not
leave
the
house
and
i
went
to
bed
without
getting
the
opportunity
i
went
to
sleep
thinking
that
i
would
tell
her
the
next
day
but
the
next
day
when
i
got
up
i
did
not
see
her
as
i
was
running
all
round
the
house
looking
for
her
barberin
saw
me
and
asked
me
what
i
wanted
mamma
she
has
gone
to
the
village
and
wo
be
back
till
this
afternoon
she
had
not
told
me
the
night
before
that
she
was
going
to
the
village
and
without
knowing
why
i
began
to
feel
anxious
why
did
she
wait
for
us
if
we
were
going
in
the
afternoon
would
she
be
back
before
we
started
without
knowing
quite
why
i
began
to
feel
very
frightened
and
barberin
looked
at
me
in
a
way
that
did
not
tend
to
reassure
me
to
escape
from
his
look
i
ran
into
the
garden
our
garden
meant
a
great
deal
to
us
in
it
we
grew
almost
all
that
we
ate
potatoes
cabbages
carrots
turnips
there
was
no
ground
wasted
yet
mother
barberin
had
given
me
a
little
patch
all
to
myself
in
which
i
had
planted
ferns
and
herbs
that
i
had
pulled
up
in
the
lanes
while
i
was
minding
the
cow
i
had
planted
everything
pell
mell
one
beside
the
other
in
my
bit
of
garden
it
was
not
beautiful
but
i
loved
it
it
was
mine
i
arranged
it
as
i
wished
just
as
i
felt
at
the
time
and
when
i
spoke
of
it
which
happened
twenty
times
a
day
it
was
my
garden
already
the
jonquils
were
in
bud
and
the
lilac
was
beginning
to
shoot
and
the
wall
flowers
would
soon
be
out
how
would
they
bloom
i
wondered
and
that
was
why
i
came
to
see
them
every
day
but
there
was
another
part
of
my
garden
that
i
studied
with
great
anxiety
i
had
planted
a
vegetable
that
some
one
had
given
to
me
and
which
was
almost
unknown
in
our
village
it
was
jerusalem
artichokes
i
was
told
they
would
be
delicious
better
than
potatoes
for
they
had
the
taste
of
french
artichokes
potatoes
and
turnips
combined
having
been
told
this
i
intended
them
to
be
a
surprise
for
mother
barberin
i
had
not
breathed
a
word
about
this
present
i
had
for
her
i
planted
them
in
my
own
bit
of
garden
when
they
began
to
shoot
i
would
let
her
think
that
they
were
flowers
then
one
fine
day
when
they
were
ripe
while
she
was
out
i
would
pull
them
up
and
cook
them
myself
how
i
was
not
quite
sure
but
i
did
not
worry
over
such
a
small
detail
then
when
she
returned
to
supper
i
would
serve
her
a
dish
of
jerusalem
artichokes
it
would
be
something
fresh
to
replace
those
everlasting
potatoes
and
mother
barberin
would
not
suffer
too
much
from
the
sale
of
poor
rousette
and
the
inventor
of
this
new
dish
of
vegetables
was
i
remi
i
was
the
one
so
i
was
of
some
use
in
the
house
with
such
a
plan
in
my
head
i
had
to
bestow
careful
attention
on
my
jerusalem
artichokes
every
day
i
looked
at
the
spot
where
i
had
planted
them
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
would
never
grow
i
was
kneeling
on
both
knees
on
the
ground
supported
on
my
hands
with
my
nose
almost
touching
the
earth
where
the
artichokes
were
sown
when
i
heard
barberin
calling
me
impatiently
i
hurried
back
to
the
house
imagine
my
surprise
when
i
saw
standing
before
the
fireplace
vitalis
and
his
dogs
i
knew
at
once
what
barberin
wanted
of
me
vitalis
had
come
to
fetch
me
and
it
was
so
that
mother
barberin
should
not
stop
me
from
going
that
barberin
had
sent
her
to
the
village
knowing
full
well
that
i
could
expect
nothing
from
barberin
i
ran
up
to
vitalis
oh
do
take
me
away
please
sir
do
take
me
away
i
began
to
sob
now
little
chap
he
said
kindly
enough
you
wo
be
unhappy
with
me
i
do
whip
children
and
you
have
the
dogs
for
company
why
should
you
be
sorry
to
go
with
me
mother
barberin
anyhow
you
not
going
to
stay
here
said
barberin
roughly
taking
me
by
the
ear
go
with
this
gentleman
or
go
to
the
workhouse
choose
no
no
mamma
mamma
so
you
going
to
make
me
mad
eh
cried
barberin
i
beat
you
good
and
hard
and
chase
you
out
of
the
house
the
child
is
sorry
to
leave
his
mamma
do
beat
him
for
that
got
feelings
that
a
good
sign
if
you
pity
him
he
cry
all
the
more
well
now
to
business
saying
that
vitalis
laid
eight
five
franc
pieces
on
the
table
which
barberin
with
a
sweep
of
his
hand
cleared
up
and
thrust
into
his
pocket
where
his
bundle
asked
vitalis
here
it
is
said
barberin
handing
him
a
blue
cotton
handkerchief
tied
up
at
the
four
corners
there
are
two
shirts
and
a
pair
of
cotton
pants
that
was
not
what
was
agreed
you
said
you
give
some
clothes
these
are
only
rags
he
ai
got
no
more
if
i
ask
the
boy
i
know
he
say
that
not
true
but
i
have
the
time
to
argue
the
matter
we
must
be
off
come
on
my
little
fellow
what
your
name
remi
well
then
remi
take
your
bundle
and
walk
along
beside
capi
i
held
out
both
my
hands
to
him
then
to
barberin
but
both
men
turned
away
their
heads
then
vitalis
took
me
by
the
wrist
i
had
to
go
ah
our
poor
little
house
it
seemed
to
me
when
i
passed
over
the
threshold
that
i
left
a
bit
of
my
body
there
with
my
eyes
full
of
tears
i
looked
around
but
there
was
no
one
near
to
help
me
no
one
on
the
road
and
no
one
in
the
field
close
by
i
began
to
call
mamma
mother
barberin
but
no
one
replied
to
my
call
and
my
voice
trailed
off
into
a
sob
i
had
to
follow
vitalis
who
had
not
let
go
of
my
wrist
and
good
luck
cried
barberin
then
he
entered
the
house
it
was
over
come
remi
hurry
along
my
child
said
vitalis
he
took
hold
of
my
arm
and
i
walked
side
by
side
with
him
fortunately
he
did
not
walk
fast
i
think
he
suited
his
step
to
mine
we
were
walking
up
hill
as
i
turned
i
could
still
see
mother
barberin
house
but
it
was
getting
smaller
and
smaller
many
a
time
i
had
walked
this
road
and
i
knew
that
for
a
little
while
longer
i
should
still
see
the
house
then
when
we
turned
the
bend
i
should
see
it
no
more
before
me
the
unknown
behind
me
was
the
house
where
until
that
day
i
had
lived
such
a
happy
life
perhaps
i
should
never
see
it
again
fortunately
the
hill
was
long
but
at
last
we
reached
the
top
vitalis
had
not
let
go
his
hold
will
you
let
me
rest
a
bit
i
asked
surely
my
boy
he
replied
he
let
go
of
me
but
i
saw
him
make
a
sign
to
capi
and
the
dog
understood
he
came
close
to
me
i
knew
that
capi
would
grab
me
by
the
leg
if
i
attempted
to
escape
i
went
up
a
high
grassy
mound
and
sat
down
the
dog
beside
me
with
eyes
i
looked
about
for
mother
barberin
cottage
below
was
the
valley
and
the
wood
and
away
in
the
distance
stood
the
little
house
i
had
left
little
puffs
of
yellow
smoke
were
coming
out
of
the
chimney
going
straight
up
in
the
sky
and
then
on
towards
us
in
spite
of
the
distance
and
the
height
i
could
see
everything
very
clearly
on
the
rubbish
heap
i
could
see
our
big
fat
hen
running
about
but
she
did
not
look
as
big
as
usual
if
i
had
not
known
that
it
was
our
hen
i
should
have
taken
her
for
a
little
pigeon
at
the
side
of
the
house
i
could
see
the
twisted
pear
tree
that
i
used
to
ride
as
a
horse
in
the
stream
i
could
just
make
out
the
drain
that
i
had
had
so
much
trouble
in
digging
so
that
it
would
work
a
mill
made
by
my
own
hands
the
wheel
alas
had
never
turned
despite
all
the
hours
i
had
spent
upon
it
i
could
see
my
garden
oh
my
dear
garden
who
would
see
my
flowers
bloom
and
my
jerusalem
artichokes
who
would
tend
them
barberin
perhaps
that
wicked
barberin
with
the
next
step
my
garden
would
be
hidden
from
me
suddenly
on
the
road
which
led
to
our
house
from
the
village
i
saw
a
white
sunbonnet
then
it
disappeared
behind
some
trees
then
it
came
in
view
again
the
distance
was
so
great
that
i
could
only
see
a
white
top
like
a
spring
butterfly
it
was
going
in
and
out
amongst
the
trees
but
there
is
a
time
when
the
heart
sees
better
and
farther
than
the
sharpest
eyes
i
knew
it
was
mother
barberin
it
was
she
i
was
sure
of
it
well
asked
vitalis
shall
we
go
on
now
oh
sir
no
please
no
then
it
is
true
what
they
say
you
have
any
legs
tired
out
already
that
does
promise
very
good
days
for
us
i
did
not
reply
i
was
looking
it
mother
barberin
it
was
her
bonnet
it
was
her
blue
skirt
she
was
walking
quickly
as
though
she
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
when
she
got
to
our
gate
she
pushed
it
open
and
went
quickly
up
the
garden
path
i
jumped
up
at
once
and
stood
up
on
the
bank
without
giving
a
thought
to
capi
who
sprang
towards
me
mother
barberin
did
not
stay
long
in
the
house
she
came
out
and
began
running
to
and
fro
in
the
yard
with
her
arms
stretched
out
she
was
looking
for
me
i
leaned
forwards
and
at
the
top
of
my
voice
i
cried
mamma
mamma
but
my
cry
could
not
reach
her
it
was
lost
in
the
air
what
the
matter
have
you
gone
crazy
asked
vitalis
i
did
not
reply
my
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
mother
barberin
but
she
did
not
look
up
for
she
did
not
know
that
i
was
there
above
her
she
went
round
the
garden
then
out
into
the
road
looking
up
and
down
i
cried
louder
but
like
my
first
call
it
was
useless
then
vitalis
understood
and
he
also
came
up
on
the
bank
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
see
the
figure
with
the
white
sunbonnet
poor
little
chap
he
said
softly
to
himself
oh
i
sobbed
encouraged
by
his
words
of
pity
do
let
me
go
back
but
he
took
me
by
the
wrist
and
drew
me
down
and
onto
the
road
as
you
are
now
rested
he
said
we
move
on
i
tried
to
free
myself
but
he
held
me
firmly
capi
zerbino
he
said
looking
at
the
dogs
the
two
dogs
came
close
to
me
capi
behind
zerbino
in
front
after
taking
a
few
steps
i
turned
round
we
had
passed
the
bend
of
the
hill
and
i
could
no
longer
see
the
valley
nor
our
house
chapter
v
en
route
because
a
man
pays
forty
francs
for
a
child
that
is
not
to
say
that
he
is
a
monster
and
that
he
intends
to
eat
the
child
vitalis
had
no
desire
to
eat
me
and
although
he
bought
children
he
was
not
a
bad
man
i
soon
had
proof
of
this
we
had
been
walking
in
silence
for
some
time
i
heaved
a
sigh
i
know
just
how
you
feel
said
vitalis
cry
all
you
want
but
try
and
see
that
this
is
for
your
own
good
those
people
are
not
your
parents
the
wife
has
been
good
to
you
and
i
know
that
you
love
her
that
is
why
you
feel
so
badly
but
she
could
not
keep
you
if
the
husband
did
not
want
you
and
he
may
not
be
such
a
bad
chap
after
all
he
is
ill
and
ca
do
any
more
work
he
find
it
hard
to
get
along
yes
what
he
said
was
true
but
i
had
only
one
thought
in
my
mind
perhaps
i
should
never
again
see
the
one
i
loved
most
in
the
world
you
wo
be
unhappy
with
me
he
continued
it
is
better
than
being
sent
to
the
home
and
let
me
tell
you
you
must
not
try
to
run
away
because
if
you
do
capi
and
zerbino
would
soon
catch
you
run
away
i
no
longer
thought
of
doing
so
where
should
i
go
this
tall
old
man
perhaps
would
be
a
kind
master
after
all
i
had
never
walked
so
far
at
a
stretch
all
around
us
were
barren
lands
and
hills
not
beautiful
like
i
had
thought
the
world
would
be
outside
of
my
village
vitalis
walked
with
big
regular
strides
carrying
on
his
shoulder
or
in
his
bag
and
the
dogs
trotted
close
to
us
from
time
to
time
vitalis
said
a
word
of
friendship
to
them
sometimes
in
french
sometimes
in
a
language
that
i
did
not
understand
neither
he
nor
the
animals
seemed
to
get
tired
but
i
i
was
exhausted
i
dragged
my
limbs
along
and
it
was
as
much
as
i
could
do
to
keep
up
with
my
new
master
yet
i
did
not
like
to
ask
him
to
let
me
stop
it
those
wooden
shoes
that
tire
you
he
said
looking
down
at
me
when
we
get
to
ussel
i
buy
you
some
shoes
these
words
gave
me
courage
i
had
always
longed
for
a
pair
of
shoes
the
mayor
son
and
the
son
wore
shoes
so
that
on
sunday
when
they
came
to
church
they
seemed
to
slide
down
the
stone
aisles
while
we
other
country
boys
in
our
clogs
made
a
deafening
noise
is
ussel
far
ah
that
comes
from
your
heart
said
vitalis
laughing
so
you
want
to
have
a
pair
of
shoes
do
you
well
i
promise
you
them
and
with
big
nails
too
and
i
buy
you
some
velvet
pants
and
a
vest
and
a
hat
that
make
you
dry
your
tears
i
hope
and
give
you
legs
to
do
the
next
six
miles
shoes
with
nails
i
was
overcome
with
pride
it
was
grand
enough
to
have
shoes
but
shoes
with
nails
i
forgot
my
grief
shoes
with
nails
velvet
pants
a
vest
a
hat
oh
if
mother
barberin
could
see
me
how
happy
she
would
be
how
proud
of
me
but
in
spite
of
the
promise
that
i
should
have
shoes
and
velvet
pants
at
the
end
of
the
six
miles
it
seemed
impossible
that
i
could
cover
the
distance
the
sky
which
had
been
blue
when
we
started
was
now
filled
with
gray
clouds
and
soon
a
fine
rain
commenced
to
fall
vitalis
was
covered
well
enough
with
his
sheepskin
and
he
was
able
to
shelter
who
at
the
first
drop
of
rain
had
promptly
retired
into
his
hiding
place
but
the
dogs
and
i
had
nothing
to
cover
us
and
soon
we
were
drenched
to
the
skin
the
dogs
from
time
to
time
could
shake
themselves
but
i
was
unable
to
employ
this
natural
means
and
i
had
to
tramp
along
under
my
heavy
garments
which
chilled
me
do
you
catch
cold
easily
asked
my
new
master
i
do
know
i
do
remember
ever
having
a
cold
that
good
so
there
is
something
in
you
but
i
do
want
to
have
it
worse
for
you
than
we
are
obliged
there
is
a
village
a
little
farther
on
and
we
sleep
there
there
was
no
inn
in
this
village
and
no
one
wanted
to
take
into
their
homes
an
old
beggar
who
dragged
along
with
him
a
child
and
three
dogs
soaked
to
the
skin
no
lodgings
here
they
said
and
they
shut
the
door
in
our
faces
we
went
from
one
house
to
another
but
all
refused
to
admit
us
must
we
tramp
those
four
miles
on
to
ussel
without
resting
a
bit
the
night
had
fallen
and
the
rain
had
chilled
us
through
and
through
oh
for
mother
barberin
house
finally
a
peasant
more
charitable
than
his
neighbors
agreed
to
let
us
go
into
his
barn
but
he
made
the
condition
that
we
could
sleep
there
but
must
have
no
light
give
me
your
matches
he
said
to
vitalis
i
give
you
them
back
when
you
go
at
least
we
had
a
roof
to
cover
us
from
the
storm
in
the
sack
which
vitalis
had
slung
over
his
back
he
took
out
a
hunch
of
bread
and
broke
it
into
four
pieces
then
i
saw
for
the
first
time
how
he
maintained
obedience
and
discipline
in
his
company
whilst
we
had
gone
from
door
to
door
seeking
shelter
zerbino
had
gone
into
a
house
and
he
had
run
out
again
almost
at
once
carrying
in
his
jaws
a
crust
vitalis
had
only
said
alright
zerbino
i
had
thought
no
more
of
this
theft
when
i
saw
vitalis
cut
the
roll
zerbino
looked
very
dejected
vitalis
and
i
were
sitting
on
a
box
with
between
us
the
three
dogs
stood
in
a
row
before
us
capi
and
dulcie
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
their
master
zerbino
stood
with
drooping
ears
and
tail
between
his
legs
the
thief
must
leave
the
ranks
and
go
into
a
corner
said
vitalis
in
a
tone
of
command
he
go
to
sleep
without
his
supper
zerbino
left
his
place
and
in
a
zigzag
went
over
to
the
corner
that
vitalis
indicated
with
his
finger
he
crouched
down
under
a
heap
of
hay
out
of
sight
but
we
heard
him
breathe
plaintively
with
a
little
whine
vitalis
then
handed
me
a
piece
of
bread
and
while
eating
his
own
he
broke
little
pieces
for
capi
and
dulcie
how
i
longed
for
mother
barberin
soup
even
without
butter
and
the
warm
fire
and
my
little
bed
with
the
coverlets
that
i
pulled
right
up
to
my
nose
completely
fagged
out
i
sat
there
my
feet
raw
by
the
rubbing
of
my
clogs
i
trembled
with
cold
in
my
wet
clothing
it
was
night
now
but
i
did
not
think
of
going
to
sleep
your
teeth
are
chattering
said
vitalis
are
you
cold
a
little
i
heard
him
open
his
bag
i
have
got
much
of
a
wardrobe
he
said
but
here
a
dry
shirt
and
a
vest
you
can
put
on
then
get
underneath
the
hay
and
you
soon
get
warm
and
go
to
sleep
but
i
did
not
get
warm
as
quick
as
vitalis
thought
for
a
long
time
i
turned
and
turned
on
my
bed
of
straw
too
unhappy
to
sleep
would
all
my
days
now
be
like
this
walking
in
the
pouring
rain
sleeping
in
a
loft
shaking
with
cold
and
only
a
piece
of
dry
bread
for
supper
no
one
to
love
me
no
one
to
cuddle
me
no
mother
barberin
my
heart
was
very
sad
the
tears
rolled
down
my
cheeks
then
i
felt
a
warm
breath
pass
over
my
face
i
stretched
out
my
hand
and
my
finger
touched
capi
woolly
coat
he
had
come
softly
to
me
stepping
cautiously
on
the
straw
and
he
smelt
me
he
sniffed
gently
his
breath
ran
over
my
cheek
and
in
my
hair
what
did
he
want
presently
he
laid
down
on
the
straw
quite
close
to
me
and
very
gently
he
commenced
to
lick
my
hand
touched
by
this
caress
i
sat
up
on
my
straw
bed
and
throwing
my
arms
round
his
neck
kissed
his
cold
nose
he
gave
a
little
stifled
cry
and
then
quickly
put
his
paw
in
my
hand
and
remained
quite
still
i
forgot
my
fatigue
and
my
sorrows
i
was
no
longer
alone
i
had
a
friend
chapter
vi
my
d√©but
we
started
early
the
next
morning
the
sky
was
blue
and
a
light
wind
had
come
up
in
the
night
and
dried
all
the
mud
the
birds
were
singing
blithely
in
the
trees
and
the
dogs
scampered
around
us
now
and
again
capi
stood
up
on
his
hind
paws
and
barked
into
my
face
two
or
three
times
i
knew
what
he
meant
he
was
my
friend
he
was
intelligent
and
he
understood
every
thing
and
he
knew
how
to
make
you
understand
in
his
tail
only
was
more
wit
and
eloquence
than
in
the
tongue
or
in
the
eyes
of
many
people
although
i
had
never
left
my
village
and
was
most
curious
to
see
a
town
what
i
most
wanted
to
see
in
that
town
was
a
boot
shop
where
was
the
welcome
shop
where
i
should
find
the
shoes
with
nails
that
vitalis
had
promised
me
i
glanced
about
in
every
direction
as
we
passed
down
the
old
streets
of
ussel
suddenly
my
master
turned
into
a
shop
behind
the
market
hanging
outside
the
front
were
some
old
guns
a
coat
trimmed
with
gold
braid
several
lamps
and
some
rusty
keys
we
went
down
three
steps
and
found
ourselves
in
a
large
room
where
the
sun
could
never
have
entered
since
the
roof
had
been
put
on
the
house
how
could
such
beautiful
things
as
nailed
shoes
be
sold
in
such
a
terrible
place
yet
vitalis
knew
and
soon
i
had
the
pleasure
of
being
shod
in
nailed
shoes
which
were
ten
times
as
heavy
as
my
clogs
my
master
generosity
did
not
stop
there
he
bought
me
a
blue
velvet
coat
a
pair
of
trousers
and
a
felt
hat
velvet
for
me
who
had
never
worn
anything
but
cotton
this
was
surely
the
best
man
in
the
world
and
the
most
generous
it
is
true
that
the
velvet
was
creased
and
that
the
woolen
trousers
were
well
worn
and
it
was
difficult
to
guess
what
had
been
the
original
color
of
the
felt
hat
it
had
been
so
soaked
with
rain
but
dazzled
by
so
much
finery
i
was
unconscious
of
the
imperfections
which
were
hidden
under
their
aspect
when
we
got
back
to
the
inn
to
my
sorrow
and
astonishment
vitalis
took
a
pair
of
scissors
and
cut
the
two
legs
of
my
trousers
to
the
height
of
the
knees
before
he
would
let
me
get
into
them
i
looked
at
him
with
round
eyes
that
because
i
do
want
you
to
look
like
everybody
else
he
explained
when
in
france
i
dress
you
like
an
italian
when
in
italy
like
a
french
boy
i
was
still
more
amazed
we
are
are
we
not
well
we
must
not
dress
like
the
ordinary
folk
if
we
went
about
dressed
like
the
country
people
do
you
think
anybody
would
look
at
us
should
we
get
a
crowd
around
us
when
we
stop
no
appearances
count
for
a
great
deal
in
life
i
was
a
french
boy
in
the
morning
and
by
night
i
had
become
an
italian
my
trousers
reached
my
knees
vitalis
interlaced
red
cords
all
down
my
stockings
and
twisted
some
red
ribbon
all
over
my
felt
hat
and
then
decorated
it
with
a
bunch
of
woolen
flowers
i
do
know
what
others
thought
of
me
but
to
be
frank
i
must
admit
that
i
thought
i
looked
superb
and
capi
was
of
the
same
opinion
for
he
stared
at
me
for
a
long
time
then
held
out
his
paw
with
a
satisfied
air
i
was
glad
to
have
capi
approval
which
was
all
the
more
agreeable
because
during
the
time
i
had
been
dressing
had
seated
himself
opposite
to
me
and
with
exaggerated
airs
had
imitated
every
movement
i
had
made
and
when
i
was
finished
put
his
hands
on
his
hips
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
mockingly
it
is
a
scientific
question
as
to
whether
monkeys
laugh
or
not
i
lived
on
familiar
terms
with
for
a
long
time
and
i
know
that
he
certainly
did
laugh
and
often
in
a
way
that
was
most
humiliating
to
me
of
course
he
did
not
laugh
like
a
man
but
when
something
amused
him
he
would
draw
back
the
corners
of
his
mouth
screw
up
his
eyes
and
work
his
jaws
rapidly
while
his
black
eyes
seemed
to
dart
flames
now
you
ready
said
vitalis
as
i
placed
my
hat
on
my
head
and
we
get
to
work
because
is
market
day
and
we
must
give
a
performance
you
must
play
in
a
comedy
with
the
two
dogs
and
but
i
do
know
how
to
play
a
comedy
i
cried
scared
that
is
why
i
am
going
to
teach
you
you
ca
know
unless
you
learn
these
animals
have
studied
hard
to
learn
their
part
it
has
been
hard
work
for
them
but
now
see
how
clever
they
are
the
piece
we
are
going
to
play
is
called
servant
or
the
fool
is
not
always
the
one
you
would
think
now
this
is
it
servant
whose
name
is
capi
is
about
to
leave
him
because
he
is
getting
old
and
capi
has
promised
his
master
that
before
he
leaves
he
will
get
him
another
servant
now
this
successor
is
not
to
be
a
dog
it
is
to
be
a
boy
a
country
boy
named
remi
oh
you
have
just
come
from
the
country
to
take
a
position
with
mr
monkeys
do
have
servants
in
plays
they
have
well
you
come
straight
from
your
village
and
your
new
master
thinks
that
you
a
fool
oh
i
do
like
that
what
does
that
matter
if
it
makes
the
people
laugh
well
you
have
come
to
this
gentleman
to
be
his
servant
and
you
are
told
to
set
the
table
here
is
one
like
we
shall
use
in
the
play
go
and
set
it
on
this
table
there
were
plates
a
glass
a
knife
a
fork
and
a
white
tablecloth
how
could
i
arrange
all
those
things
as
i
pondered
over
this
question
leaning
forward
with
hands
stretched
out
and
mouth
open
not
knowing
where
to
begin
my
master
clapped
his
hands
and
laughed
heartily
bravo
he
cried
bravo
that
perfect
the
boy
i
had
before
put
on
a
sly
expression
as
much
as
to
say
what
a
fool
i
can
make
of
myself
you
are
natural
that
is
splendid
but
i
do
know
what
i
have
to
do
that
why
you
are
so
good
after
you
do
know
you
will
have
to
pretend
just
what
you
are
feeling
now
if
you
can
get
that
same
expression
and
stand
just
like
you
are
standing
now
you
be
a
great
success
to
play
this
part
to
perfection
you
have
only
to
act
and
look
as
you
do
at
this
moment
servant
was
not
a
great
play
the
performance
lasted
not
more
than
twenty
minutes
vitalis
made
us
do
it
over
and
over
again
the
dogs
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
our
master
so
patient
i
had
seen
the
animals
in
my
village
treated
with
oaths
and
blows
when
they
could
not
learn
although
the
lesson
lasted
a
long
time
not
once
did
he
get
angry
not
once
did
he
swear
now
do
that
over
again
he
said
severely
when
a
mistake
had
been
made
that
is
bad
capi
i
scold
you
if
you
do
pay
attention
and
that
was
all
but
yet
it
was
enough
take
the
dogs
for
an
example
he
said
while
teaching
me
compare
them
with
has
perhaps
vivacity
and
intelligence
but
he
has
no
patience
he
learns
easily
what
he
is
taught
but
he
forgets
it
at
once
besides
he
never
does
what
he
is
told
willingly
he
likes
to
do
just
the
contrary
that
is
his
nature
and
that
is
why
i
do
not
get
angry
with
him
monkeys
have
not
the
same
conscience
that
a
dog
has
they
do
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
and
that
is
why
they
are
inferior
to
the
dog
do
you
understand
that
i
think
so
you
are
intelligent
and
attentive
be
obedient
do
your
best
in
what
you
have
to
do
remember
that
all
through
life
talking
to
him
so
i
summoned
up
courage
to
ask
him
about
what
had
so
astonished
me
during
the
rehearsal
how
could
he
be
so
wonderfully
patient
with
the
dogs
the
monkey
and
myself
he
smiled
one
can
see
that
you
have
lived
only
with
peasants
who
are
rough
with
animals
and
think
that
they
can
only
be
made
to
obey
by
having
a
stick
held
over
their
heads
a
great
mistake
one
gains
very
little
by
being
cruel
but
one
can
obtain
a
lot
if
not
all
by
gentleness
it
is
because
i
am
never
unkind
to
my
animals
that
they
are
what
they
are
if
i
had
beaten
them
they
would
be
frightened
creatures
fear
paralyzes
the
intelligence
besides
if
i
gave
way
to
temper
i
should
not
be
what
i
am
i
could
not
have
acquired
this
patience
which
has
won
their
confidence
that
shows
that
who
instructs
others
instructs
himself
as
i
have
given
lessons
to
my
animals
so
i
have
received
lessons
from
them
i
have
developed
their
intelligence
they
have
formed
my
character
i
laughed
this
seemed
strange
to
me
you
find
that
odd
he
continued
odd
that
a
dog
could
give
a
lesson
to
a
man
yet
it
is
true
the
master
is
obliged
to
watch
over
himself
when
he
undertakes
to
teach
a
dog
the
dog
takes
after
the
master
show
me
your
dog
and
i
tell
you
what
you
are
the
criminal
has
a
dog
who
is
a
rogue
the
burglar
dog
is
a
thief
the
country
yokel
has
a
stupid
unintelligent
dog
a
kind
thoughtful
man
has
a
good
dog
i
was
very
nervous
at
the
thought
of
appearing
before
the
public
the
next
day
the
dogs
and
the
monkey
had
the
advantage
over
me
they
had
played
before
hundreds
of
times
what
would
vitalis
say
if
i
did
not
play
my
part
well
what
would
the
audience
say
i
was
so
worried
that
when
at
last
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
i
could
see
in
my
dreams
a
crowd
of
people
holding
their
sides
with
laughter
because
i
was
such
a
fool
i
was
even
more
nervous
the
next
day
when
we
marched
off
in
a
procession
to
the
market
place
where
we
were
to
give
our
performance
vitalis
led
the
way
holding
his
head
high
and
with
chest
thrown
out
he
kept
time
with
his
arms
and
feet
while
gayly
playing
his
fife
behind
him
came
capi
carrying
on
his
back
wearing
the
uniform
of
an
english
general
a
red
coat
and
trousers
trimmed
with
gold
braid
and
helmet
topped
with
a
plume
zerbino
and
dulcie
came
next
at
a
respectful
distance
i
brought
up
the
rear
our
procession
took
up
some
length
as
we
had
to
walk
a
certain
space
apart
the
piercing
notes
of
the
fife
brought
the
people
running
from
their
houses
scores
of
children
ran
behind
us
and
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
square
there
was
a
great
crowd
our
theater
was
quickly
arranged
a
rope
was
fastened
to
four
trees
and
in
the
middle
of
this
square
we
took
our
places
the
first
numbers
on
the
program
consisted
of
various
tricks
performed
by
the
dogs
i
had
not
the
slightest
notion
what
they
did
i
was
so
nervous
and
taken
up
in
repeating
my
own
part
all
that
i
remember
was
that
vitalis
put
aside
his
fife
and
took
his
violin
and
played
accompaniments
to
the
dogs
maneuvers
sometimes
it
was
dance
music
sometimes
sentimental
airs
the
tricks
over
capi
took
a
metal
cup
between
his
teeth
and
began
to
go
the
round
of
the
distinguished
audience
when
a
spectator
failed
to
drop
a
coin
in
he
put
his
two
fore
paws
upon
the
reluctant
pocket
barked
three
times
then
tapped
the
pocket
with
his
paw
at
this
every
one
laughed
and
shouted
with
delight
if
that
ai
a
cunning
spaniel
he
knows
who
got
money
and
who
has
say
out
with
it
he
give
something
not
he
and
his
uncle
left
him
a
legacy
the
stingy
cuss
and
finally
a
penny
was
dug
out
of
a
deep
pocket
and
thrown
into
the
cup
during
this
time
vitalis
without
saying
a
word
but
with
his
eyes
following
capi
gayly
played
his
violin
soon
capi
returned
to
his
master
proudly
carrying
the
full
cup
now
for
the
comedy
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
vitalis
gesticulating
with
his
bow
in
one
hand
and
his
violin
in
the
other
we
are
going
to
give
a
delightful
comedy
called
servant
or
the
fool
is
not
always
the
one
you
would
think
a
man
of
my
standing
does
not
lower
himself
by
praising
his
plays
and
actors
in
advance
all
i
have
to
say
is
look
listen
and
be
ready
to
applaud
what
vitalis
called
a
delightful
comedy
was
really
a
pantomime
naturally
it
had
to
be
for
the
very
good
reason
that
two
of
its
principals
and
capi
could
not
speak
and
the
third
myself
was
incapable
of
uttering
two
words
however
so
that
the
audience
would
clearly
understand
the
play
vitalis
explained
the
various
situations
as
the
piece
progressed
for
instance
striking
up
a
warlike
air
he
announced
the
entrance
of
general
who
had
won
his
high
rank
in
various
battles
in
india
up
to
that
day
general
had
only
had
capi
for
a
servant
but
he
now
wished
to
have
a
human
being
as
his
means
allowed
him
this
luxury
for
a
long
time
animals
had
been
the
slaves
of
men
but
it
was
time
that
such
was
changed
while
waiting
for
the
servant
to
arrive
the
general
walked
up
and
down
smoking
his
cigar
you
should
see
the
way
he
blew
the
smoke
into
the
onlookers
faces
becoming
impatient
he
began
to
roll
his
eyes
like
a
man
who
is
about
to
have
a
fit
of
temper
he
bit
his
lips
and
stamped
on
the
ground
at
the
third
stamp
i
had
to
make
my
appearance
on
the
scene
led
by
capi
if
i
had
forgotten
my
part
the
dog
would
have
reminded
me
at
a
given
moment
he
held
out
his
paw
to
me
and
introduced
me
to
the
general
the
latter
upon
noticing
me
held
up
his
two
hands
in
despair
what
was
that
the
servant
they
had
procured
for
him
then
he
came
and
looked
pertly
up
into
my
face
and
walked
around
me
shrugging
his
shoulders
his
expression
was
so
comical
that
every
one
burst
out
laughing
they
quite
understood
that
the
monkey
thought
i
was
a
fool
the
spectators
thought
that
also
the
piece
was
made
to
show
how
dense
was
my
stupidity
while
every
opportunity
was
afforded
the
monkey
to
show
his
sagacity
and
intelligence
after
having
examined
me
thoroughly
the
general
out
of
pity
decided
to
keep
me
he
pointed
to
a
table
that
was
already
set
for
luncheon
and
signed
to
me
to
take
my
seat
the
general
thinks
that
after
his
servant
has
had
something
to
eat
he
wo
be
such
an
idiot
explained
vitalis
i
sat
down
at
the
little
table
a
table
napkin
was
placed
on
my
plate
what
was
i
to
do
with
the
napkin
capi
made
a
sign
for
me
to
use
it
after
looking
at
it
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
i
blew
my
nose
then
the
general
held
his
sides
with
laughter
and
capi
fell
over
with
his
four
paws
up
in
the
air
upset
at
my
stupidity
seeing
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
i
stared
again
at
the
table
napkin
wondering
what
i
was
to
do
with
it
then
i
had
an
idea
i
rolled
it
up
and
made
a
necktie
for
myself
more
laughter
from
the
general
another
fall
from
capi
his
paws
in
the
air
then
finally
overcome
with
exasperation
the
general
dragged
me
from
the
chair
seated
himself
at
my
place
and
ate
up
the
meal
that
had
been
prepared
for
me
ah
he
knew
how
to
use
a
table
napkin
how
gracefully
he
tucked
it
into
his
uniform
and
spread
it
out
upon
his
knees
and
with
what
an
elegant
air
he
broke
his
bread
and
emptied
his
glass
the
climax
was
reached
when
luncheon
over
he
asked
for
a
toothpick
which
he
quickly
passed
between
his
teeth
at
this
applause
broke
out
on
all
sides
and
the
performance
ended
triumphantly
what
a
fool
of
a
servant
and
what
a
wonderful
monkey
on
our
way
back
to
the
inn
vitalis
complimented
me
and
i
was
already
such
a
good
comedian
that
i
appreciated
this
praise
from
my
master
chapter
vii
child
and
animal
learning
vitalis
small
group
of
actors
were
certainly
very
clever
but
their
talent
was
not
very
versatile
for
this
reason
we
were
not
able
to
remain
long
in
the
same
town
three
days
after
our
arrival
in
ussel
we
were
on
our
way
again
where
were
we
going
i
had
grown
bold
enough
to
put
this
question
to
my
master
do
you
know
this
part
of
the
country
he
asked
looking
at
me
no
then
why
do
you
ask
where
we
are
going
so
as
to
know
to
know
what
i
was
silent
do
you
know
how
to
read
he
asked
after
looking
thoughtfully
at
me
for
a
moment
no
then
i
teach
you
from
a
book
the
names
and
all
about
the
towns
through
which
we
travel
it
will
be
like
having
a
story
told
to
you
i
had
been
brought
up
in
utter
ignorance
true
i
had
been
sent
to
the
village
school
for
one
month
but
during
this
month
i
had
never
once
had
a
book
in
my
hand
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
there
were
many
villages
in
france
that
did
not
even
boast
of
a
school
and
in
some
where
there
was
a
schoolmaster
either
he
knew
nothing
or
he
had
some
other
occupation
and
could
give
little
attention
to
the
children
confided
to
his
care
this
was
the
case
with
the
master
of
our
village
school
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
was
ignorant
but
during
the
month
that
i
attended
his
school
he
did
not
give
us
one
single
lesson
he
had
something
else
to
do
by
trade
he
was
a
or
rather
a
clog
maker
for
no
one
bought
shoes
from
him
he
sat
at
his
bench
all
day
shaving
pieces
of
beech
wood
into
clogs
so
i
learnt
absolutely
nothing
at
school
not
even
my
alphabet
is
it
difficult
to
read
i
asked
after
we
had
walked
some
time
in
silence
have
you
got
a
hard
head
i
do
know
but
i
like
to
learn
if
you
teach
me
well
we
see
about
that
we
plenty
of
time
ahead
of
us
time
ahead
of
us
why
not
commence
at
once
i
did
not
know
how
difficult
it
was
to
learn
to
read
i
thought
that
i
just
had
to
open
a
book
and
almost
at
once
know
what
it
contained
the
next
day
as
we
were
walking
along
vitalis
stooped
down
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
wood
covered
with
dust
see
this
is
the
book
from
which
you
are
going
to
learn
to
read
he
said
a
book
a
piece
of
wood
i
looked
at
him
to
see
if
he
were
joking
but
he
looked
quite
serious
i
stared
at
the
bit
of
wood
it
was
as
long
as
my
arm
and
as
wide
as
my
two
hands
there
was
no
inscription
or
drawing
on
it
wait
until
we
get
to
those
trees
down
there
where
we
rest
said
vitalis
smiling
at
my
astonishment
i
show
you
how
i
going
to
teach
you
to
read
from
this
when
we
got
to
the
trees
we
threw
our
bags
on
the
ground
and
sat
down
on
the
green
grass
with
the
daisies
growing
here
and
there
having
got
rid
of
his
chain
sprang
up
into
a
tree
and
shook
the
branches
one
after
the
other
as
though
he
were
making
nuts
fall
the
dogs
lay
down
beside
us
vitalis
took
out
his
knife
and
after
having
smoothed
the
wood
on
both
sides
began
to
cut
tiny
pieces
twelve
all
of
equal
size
i
am
going
to
carve
a
letter
out
of
each
piece
of
wood
he
said
looking
up
at
me
i
had
not
taken
my
eyes
off
of
him
you
will
learn
these
letters
from
their
shapes
and
when
you
are
able
to
tell
me
what
they
are
at
first
sight
i
form
them
into
words
when
you
can
read
the
words
then
you
shall
learn
from
a
book
i
soon
had
my
pockets
full
of
little
bits
of
wood
and
was
not
long
in
learning
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
but
to
know
how
to
read
was
quite
another
thing
i
could
not
get
along
very
fast
and
often
i
regretted
having
expressed
a
wish
to
learn
i
must
say
however
it
was
not
because
i
was
lazy
it
was
pride
while
teaching
me
my
letters
vitalis
thought
that
he
would
teach
capi
at
the
same
time
if
a
dog
could
learn
to
tell
the
hour
from
a
watch
why
could
he
not
learn
the
letters
the
pieces
of
wood
were
all
spread
out
on
the
grass
and
he
was
taught
that
with
his
paw
he
must
draw
out
the
letter
for
which
he
was
asked
at
first
i
made
more
progress
than
he
but
if
i
had
quicker
intelligence
he
had
better
memory
once
he
learnt
a
thing
he
knew
it
always
he
did
not
forget
when
i
made
a
mistake
vitalis
would
say
capi
will
learn
to
read
before
you
remi
and
capi
evidently
understanding
proudly
shook
his
tail
i
was
so
hurt
that
i
applied
myself
to
the
task
with
all
my
heart
and
while
the
poor
dog
could
get
no
farther
than
pulling
out
the
four
letters
which
spelled
his
name
i
finally
learned
to
read
from
a
book
now
that
you
know
how
to
read
words
how
would
you
like
to
read
music
asked
vitalis
if
i
knew
how
to
read
music
could
i
sing
like
you
i
asked
ah
so
you
would
like
to
sing
like
me
he
answered
i
know
that
would
be
impossible
but
i
like
to
sing
a
little
do
you
like
to
hear
me
sing
then
i
like
it
more
than
anything
it
is
better
than
the
nightingales
but
it
not
like
their
song
at
all
when
you
sing
sometimes
i
want
to
cry
and
sometimes
i
want
to
laugh
do
think
me
silly
master
but
when
you
sing
those
songs
i
think
that
i
am
back
with
dear
mother
barberin
if
i
shut
my
eyes
i
can
see
her
again
in
our
little
house
and
yet
i
do
know
the
words
you
sing
because
they
are
italian
i
looked
up
at
him
and
saw
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
then
i
stopped
and
asked
him
if
what
i
had
said
hurt
him
no
my
child
he
said
his
voice
shaking
you
do
not
pain
me
on
the
contrary
you
take
me
back
to
my
younger
days
yes
i
will
teach
you
to
sing
little
remi
and
as
you
have
a
heart
you
also
will
make
people
weep
with
your
songs
he
stopped
suddenly
and
i
felt
that
he
did
not
wish
to
say
more
at
that
moment
i
did
not
know
the
reason
why
he
should
feel
sad
the
next
day
he
cut
out
little
pieces
of
wood
for
the
music
notes
the
same
as
he
had
for
the
letters
the
notes
were
more
complicated
than
the
alphabet
and
this
time
i
found
it
much
harder
and
more
tedious
to
learn
vitalis
so
patient
with
the
dogs
more
than
once
lost
patience
with
me
with
an
animal
he
cried
one
controls
oneself
because
one
is
dealing
with
a
poor
dumb
creature
but
you
are
enough
to
drive
me
mad
he
threw
up
his
hands
dramatically
who
took
special
delight
in
imitating
gestures
he
thought
funny
mimicked
my
master
and
as
the
monkey
was
present
at
my
lessons
every
day
i
had
the
humiliation
to
see
him
lift
his
arms
in
despair
every
time
i
hesitated
see
is
even
mocking
you
cried
vitalis
if
i
had
dared
i
would
have
said
that
he
mocked
the
master
just
as
much
as
the
pupil
but
respect
as
well
as
a
certain
fear
forbade
me
finally
after
many
weeks
of
study
i
was
able
to
sing
an
air
from
a
piece
of
paper
that
vitalis
himself
had
written
that
day
my
master
did
not
throw
up
his
hands
but
instead
patted
me
on
the
cheek
declaring
that
if
i
continued
thus
i
should
certainly
become
a
great
singer
chapter
viii
one
who
had
known
a
king
our
mode
of
traveling
was
very
simple
we
went
straight
ahead
anywhere
and
when
we
found
a
village
which
from
the
distance
looked
sufficiently
important
we
began
preparations
for
a
triumphal
entry
i
dressed
the
dogs
and
combed
dulcie
hair
stuck
a
plaster
over
capi
eye
when
he
was
playing
the
part
of
an
old
grouchy
man
and
forced
into
his
general
uniform
that
was
the
most
difficult
thing
i
had
to
do
for
the
monkey
who
knew
well
enough
that
this
was
a
prelude
to
work
for
him
invented
the
oddest
tricks
to
prevent
me
from
dressing
him
then
i
was
forced
to
call
capi
to
come
to
my
aid
and
between
the
two
of
us
we
finally
managed
to
subdue
him
the
company
all
dressed
vitalis
took
his
fife
and
we
went
in
marching
order
into
the
village
if
the
number
of
people
who
trooped
behind
us
was
sufficient
we
gave
a
performance
but
if
we
had
only
a
few
stragglers
we
did
not
think
it
worth
our
while
to
stop
so
continued
on
our
way
when
we
stayed
several
days
in
a
town
vitalis
would
let
me
go
about
alone
if
capi
was
with
me
he
trusted
me
with
capi
you
are
traveling
through
france
at
the
age
when
most
boys
are
at
school
he
once
said
to
me
open
your
eyes
look
and
learn
when
you
see
something
that
you
do
not
understand
do
not
be
afraid
to
ask
me
questions
i
have
not
always
been
what
you
see
me
now
i
have
learnt
many
other
things
what
we
will
speak
of
that
later
for
the
present
listen
to
my
advice
and
when
you
grow
up
i
hope
you
will
think
with
a
little
gratitude
of
the
poor
musician
of
whom
you
were
so
afraid
when
he
took
you
from
your
adopted
mother
the
change
may
not
be
bad
for
you
after
all
i
wondered
what
my
master
had
been
in
the
days
gone
by
we
tramped
on
until
we
came
to
the
plains
of
quercy
which
were
very
flat
and
desolate
there
was
not
a
brook
pond
or
river
to
be
seen
in
the
middle
of
the
plain
we
came
to
a
small
village
called
we
spent
the
night
in
a
barn
belonging
to
the
inn
it
was
here
in
this
village
said
vitalis
and
probably
in
this
inn
that
a
man
was
born
who
led
thousands
of
soldiers
to
battle
and
who
having
commenced
his
life
as
a
stable
boy
afterwards
became
a
king
his
name
was
murat
they
called
him
a
hero
and
they
named
this
village
after
him
i
knew
him
and
often
talked
with
him
when
he
was
a
stable
boy
no
replied
vitalis
laughing
when
he
was
a
king
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
in
this
part
of
the
country
i
knew
him
in
naples
where
he
was
king
you
have
known
a
king
the
tone
in
which
i
said
this
must
have
been
rather
comical
for
my
master
laughed
heartily
we
were
seated
on
a
bench
before
the
stable
door
our
backs
against
the
wall
which
was
still
hot
from
the
sun
rays
the
locusts
were
chanting
their
monotonous
song
in
a
great
sycamore
which
covered
us
with
its
branches
over
the
tops
of
the
houses
the
full
moon
which
had
just
appeared
rose
gently
in
the
heavens
the
night
seemed
all
the
more
beautiful
because
the
day
had
been
scorchingly
hot
do
you
want
to
go
to
bed
asked
vitalis
or
would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
the
story
of
king
murat
oh
tell
me
the
story
then
he
told
me
the
story
of
joachim
murat
for
hours
we
sat
on
the
bench
as
he
talked
the
pale
light
from
the
moon
fell
across
him
and
i
listened
in
rapt
attention
my
eyes
fixed
on
his
face
i
had
not
heard
this
story
before
who
would
have
told
me
not
mother
barberin
surely
she
did
not
know
anything
about
it
she
was
born
at
chavanon
and
would
probably
die
there
her
mind
had
never
traveled
farther
than
her
eyes
my
master
had
seen
a
king
and
this
king
had
spoken
to
him
what
was
my
master
in
his
youth
and
how
had
he
become
what
i
saw
him
now
in
his
old
age
we
had
been
tramping
since
morning
vitalis
had
said
that
we
should
reach
a
village
by
night
where
we
could
sleep
but
night
had
come
and
i
saw
no
signs
of
this
village
no
smoke
in
the
distance
to
indicate
that
we
were
near
a
house
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
stretch
of
plains
ahead
of
us
i
was
tired
and
longed
to
go
to
sleep
vitalis
was
tired
also
he
wanted
to
stop
and
rest
by
the
roadside
but
instead
of
sitting
down
beside
him
i
told
him
that
i
would
climb
a
hill
that
was
on
the
left
of
us
and
see
if
i
could
make
out
a
village
i
called
capi
but
capi
also
was
tired
and
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
my
call
this
he
usually
did
when
he
did
not
wish
to
obey
me
are
you
afraid
asked
vitalis
his
question
made
me
start
off
at
once
alone
night
had
fallen
there
was
no
moon
but
the
twinkling
stars
in
the
sky
threw
their
light
on
a
misty
atmosphere
the
various
things
around
me
seemed
to
take
on
a
strange
weird
form
in
the
dim
light
wild
furze
grew
in
bushes
beside
some
huge
stones
which
towering
above
me
seemed
as
though
they
turned
to
look
at
me
the
higher
i
climbed
the
thicker
became
the
trees
and
shrubs
their
tops
passing
over
my
head
and
interlacing
sometimes
i
had
to
crawl
through
them
to
get
by
yet
i
was
determined
to
get
to
the
top
of
the
hill
but
when
at
last
i
did
and
gazed
around
i
could
see
no
light
anywhere
nothing
but
strange
shadows
and
forms
and
great
trees
which
seemed
to
hold
out
their
branches
to
me
like
arms
ready
to
enfold
me
i
listened
to
see
if
i
could
catch
the
bark
of
a
dog
or
the
bellow
of
a
cow
but
all
was
silent
with
my
ear
on
the
alert
scarcely
breathing
so
as
to
hear
better
i
stood
quiet
for
a
moment
then
i
began
to
tremble
the
silence
of
this
lonely
uncultivated
country
frightened
me
of
what
was
i
frightened
the
silence
probably
the
night
anyhow
a
nameless
fear
was
creeping
over
me
my
heart
beat
quickly
as
though
some
danger
was
near
i
glanced
fearfully
around
me
and
then
in
the
distance
i
saw
a
great
form
moving
amongst
the
trees
at
the
same
time
i
could
hear
the
rustling
of
branches
i
tried
to
tell
myself
that
it
was
fear
that
made
me
fancy
i
saw
something
unusual
perhaps
it
was
a
shrub
a
branch
but
then
the
branches
were
moving
and
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
or
a
breeze
that
could
shake
them
they
could
not
move
unless
swayed
by
the
breeze
or
touched
by
some
one
some
one
no
this
great
dark
form
that
was
coming
towards
me
could
not
be
a
man
some
kind
of
animal
that
i
did
not
know
or
an
immense
night
bird
a
gigantic
spider
hovering
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
what
was
certain
this
creature
had
legs
of
unusual
length
which
brought
it
along
with
amazing
bounds
seeing
this
i
quickly
found
my
own
legs
and
rushed
down
the
hill
towards
vitalis
but
strange
to
say
i
made
less
haste
going
down
than
i
had
in
climbing
up
i
threw
myself
into
the
thick
of
the
thistles
and
brambles
scratching
myself
at
every
step
scrambling
out
of
a
prickly
bush
i
took
a
glance
back
the
animal
was
coming
nearer
it
was
almost
upon
me
fortunately
i
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
and
i
could
run
quicker
across
the
grass
although
i
raced
at
the
top
of
my
speed
the
thing
was
gaining
upon
me
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
look
behind
i
knew
that
it
was
just
at
the
back
of
me
i
could
scarcely
breathe
my
race
had
almost
exhausted
me
my
breath
came
in
gasps
i
made
one
final
effort
and
fell
sprawling
at
vitalis
feet
i
could
only
repeat
two
words
the
beast
the
beast
above
the
loud
barking
of
the
dogs
i
heard
a
hearty
peal
of
laughter
at
the
same
time
my
master
put
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
forced
me
to
look
round
you
goose
he
cried
still
laughing
look
up
and
see
it
his
laugh
more
than
his
words
brought
me
to
my
senses
i
opened
one
eye
then
the
other
and
looked
where
he
was
pointing
the
apparition
which
had
so
frightened
me
had
stopped
and
was
standing
still
in
the
road
at
the
sight
of
it
again
i
must
confess
i
began
to
shake
but
i
was
with
vitalis
and
the
dogs
were
beside
me
i
was
not
alone
up
there
in
the
trees
i
looked
up
boldly
and
fixed
my
eyes
on
the
thing
was
it
an
animal
or
a
man
it
had
the
body
the
head
and
arms
like
a
man
but
the
shaggy
skin
which
covered
it
and
the
two
long
thin
legs
upon
which
it
seemed
to
poise
looked
as
though
they
belonged
to
an
animal
although
the
night
was
dark
i
could
see
this
for
the
silhouette
of
this
dark
form
stood
out
against
the
starry
sky
i
should
have
remained
a
long
time
undecided
as
to
what
it
was
if
my
master
had
not
spoken
to
it
can
you
tell
me
if
we
are
far
from
the
village
he
asked
politely
he
was
a
man
then
if
one
could
speak
to
him
what
was
my
astonishment
when
the
animal
said
that
there
were
no
houses
near
but
an
inn
to
which
he
would
take
us
if
he
could
talk
why
did
he
have
paws
if
i
had
had
the
courage
i
would
have
gone
up
to
him
to
see
how
his
paws
were
made
but
i
was
still
somewhat
afraid
so
i
picked
up
my
bag
and
followed
my
master
without
saying
a
word
you
see
now
what
scared
you
so
vitalis
said
laughing
as
we
went
on
our
way
but
i
do
know
what
it
is
yet
are
there
giants
in
this
part
of
the
country
then
yes
when
men
are
standing
on
stilts
then
he
explained
to
me
that
the
landais
so
as
to
get
over
the
marshy
plains
and
not
sink
in
up
to
their
hips
stride
about
the
country
on
stilts
what
a
goose
i
had
been
chapter
ix
arrested
i
had
a
pleasant
remembrance
of
pau
the
beautiful
winter
resort
where
the
wind
scarcely
ever
blew
we
stayed
there
the
whole
winter
for
we
were
taking
in
quite
a
lot
of
money
our
audience
consisted
mostly
of
children
and
they
were
never
tired
if
we
did
give
the
same
performance
over
and
over
again
they
were
children
of
the
rich
mostly
english
and
american
fat
little
boys
with
ruddy
skins
and
pretty
little
girls
with
soft
eyes
almost
as
beautiful
as
dulcie
it
was
from
these
children
that
i
got
a
taste
for
candy
for
they
always
came
with
their
pockets
stuffed
with
sweets
which
they
divided
between
the
dogs
and
myself
but
when
the
spring
approached
our
audience
grew
smaller
one
by
one
two
by
two
the
little
ones
came
to
shake
hands
with
capi
and
dulcie
they
had
come
to
say
they
were
going
away
so
we
also
had
to
leave
the
beautiful
winter
resort
and
take
up
our
wandering
life
again
for
a
long
time
i
do
not
know
how
many
days
or
weeks
we
went
through
valleys
over
hills
leaving
behind
the
bluish
top
of
the
pyrenees
which
now
looked
like
a
mass
of
clouds
then
one
night
we
came
to
a
great
town
with
ugly
red
brick
houses
and
with
streets
paved
with
little
pointed
stones
hard
to
the
feet
of
travelers
who
had
walked
a
dozen
miles
a
day
my
master
told
me
that
we
were
in
toulouse
and
that
we
should
stay
there
for
a
long
time
as
usual
the
first
thing
we
did
was
to
look
about
for
a
suitable
place
to
hold
the
next
day
performance
suitable
places
were
not
lacking
especially
near
the
botanical
gardens
where
there
is
a
beautiful
lawn
shaded
with
big
trees
and
a
wide
avenue
leading
to
it
it
was
in
one
of
the
side
walks
that
we
gave
our
first
performance
a
policeman
stood
by
while
we
arranged
our
things
he
seemed
annoyed
either
because
he
did
not
like
dogs
or
because
he
thought
we
had
no
business
there
he
tried
to
send
us
away
it
would
have
been
better
if
we
had
gone
we
were
not
strong
enough
to
hold
out
against
the
police
but
my
master
did
not
think
so
although
he
was
an
old
man
strolling
about
the
country
with
his
dogs
he
was
very
proud
he
considered
that
as
he
was
not
breaking
the
law
he
should
have
police
protection
so
when
the
officer
wanted
to
send
us
away
he
refused
to
leave
vitalis
was
very
polite
in
fact
he
carried
his
italian
politeness
to
the
extreme
one
might
have
thought
that
he
was
addressing
some
high
and
mighty
personage
the
illustrious
gentleman
who
represents
the
police
authority
he
said
taking
off
his
hat
and
bowing
low
to
the
policeman
can
he
show
me
an
order
emanating
from
the
said
authority
which
states
that
it
is
forbidden
for
poor
strolling
players
like
ourselves
to
carry
on
their
humble
profession
on
a
public
square
the
policeman
replied
that
he
would
have
no
argument
we
must
obey
certainly
replied
vitalis
and
i
promise
that
i
will
do
as
you
order
as
soon
as
you
let
me
know
by
what
authority
you
issue
it
that
day
the
officer
turned
on
his
heels
and
my
master
with
hat
in
hand
body
bent
low
smilingly
bowed
to
the
retreating
form
but
the
next
day
the
representative
of
the
law
returned
and
jumping
over
the
ropes
which
inclosed
our
theater
he
sprang
into
the
middle
of
the
performance
muzzle
those
dogs
he
said
roughly
to
vitalis
muzzle
my
dogs
it
an
order
of
the
law
you
ought
to
know
that
the
spectators
began
to
protest
do
interrupt
let
him
finish
the
show
cop
vitalis
then
took
off
his
felt
hat
and
with
his
plumes
sweeping
the
ground
he
made
three
stately
bows
to
the
officer
the
illustrious
gentleman
representing
the
law
does
he
tell
me
that
i
must
muzzle
my
actors
he
asked
yes
and
be
quick
about
it
muzzle
capi
zerbino
and
dulcie
cried
vitalis
addressing
himself
more
to
the
audience
than
to
the
officer
how
can
the
great
physician
capi
known
throughout
the
universe
prescribe
a
cure
for
if
the
said
physician
wears
a
muzzle
on
the
end
of
his
nose
the
children
and
parents
began
to
laugh
vitalis
encouraged
by
the
applause
continued
and
how
can
the
charming
nurse
dulcie
use
her
eloquence
to
persuade
the
patient
to
take
the
horrible
medicine
which
is
to
relieve
him
of
his
pains
if
i
am
forced
to
carry
out
this
cruel
order
of
the
law
i
ask
the
audience
if
this
is
fair
the
clapping
of
hands
and
shouts
of
laughter
from
the
onlookers
was
answer
enough
they
cheered
vitalis
and
hooted
the
policeman
and
above
all
they
were
amused
at
the
grimaces
was
making
he
had
taken
his
place
behind
the
illustrious
gentleman
who
represented
the
law
and
was
making
ridiculous
grimaces
behind
his
back
the
officer
crossed
his
arms
then
uncrossed
them
and
stuck
his
fists
on
his
hips
and
threw
back
his
head
so
did
the
monkey
the
onlookers
screamed
with
laughter
the
officer
turned
round
suddenly
to
see
what
amused
them
and
saw
the
monkey
striking
his
own
attitude
to
perfection
for
some
moments
the
monkey
and
the
man
stared
at
each
other
it
was
a
question
which
would
lower
his
eyes
first
the
crowd
yelled
with
delight
if
your
dogs
are
not
muzzled
cried
the
policeman
angrily
shaking
his
first
you
be
arrested
that
all
until
signor
said
vitalis
bowing
until
as
the
officer
strode
away
vitalis
stood
with
his
body
almost
bent
to
the
ground
in
mock
respect
i
thought
that
he
would
buy
some
muzzles
for
the
dogs
but
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
and
the
evening
passed
without
him
even
mentioning
his
quarrel
with
the
policeman
i
decided
at
last
to
broach
the
subject
myself
if
you
do
want
capi
to
tear
off
his
muzzle
during
the
performance
i
said
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
put
it
on
him
beforehand
and
let
him
get
used
to
it
we
can
teach
him
that
he
must
keep
it
on
you
think
i
am
going
to
put
one
of
those
things
on
their
little
noses
the
officer
is
down
on
us
you
are
only
a
country
boy
like
all
peasants
you
are
afraid
of
a
policeman
do
worry
he
added
i
have
matters
arranged
so
that
the
policeman
ca
have
me
arrested
and
at
the
same
time
so
that
the
dogs
wo
be
uncomfortable
on
the
other
hand
the
public
shall
be
amused
a
bit
this
officer
should
be
the
means
of
bringing
us
some
more
money
and
in
the
bargain
play
the
comic
r√¥le
in
the
piece
that
i
shall
prepare
for
him
now
you
are
to
go
there
alone
with
you
will
arrange
the
ropes
and
play
a
few
pieces
on
your
harp
and
when
you
have
a
large
audience
the
officer
will
arrive
on
the
scene
i
will
make
my
appearance
with
the
dogs
then
the
farce
will
commence
i
did
not
at
all
like
going
alone
the
next
day
but
i
knew
that
my
master
must
be
obeyed
as
soon
as
i
got
to
our
usual
place
i
roped
off
an
inclosure
and
commenced
to
play
the
people
came
from
all
parts
and
crowded
outside
the
ropes
by
now
i
had
learnt
to
play
the
harp
and
sing
very
well
amongst
other
songs
i
had
learnt
a
neapolitan
which
was
always
greatly
applauded
but
i
knew
that
the
crowd
had
not
come
to
pay
tribute
to
my
talent
all
who
had
witnessed
the
dispute
with
the
officer
the
day
before
were
present
and
had
brought
their
friends
with
them
the
police
are
not
liked
at
toulouse
and
the
public
were
curious
to
see
how
the
old
italian
would
come
out
and
what
significance
was
attached
to
his
parting
words
until
signor
several
of
the
spectators
seeing
me
alone
with
interrupted
my
song
to
ask
if
the
old
italian
was
coming
i
nodded
the
policeman
arrived
saw
him
first
he
at
once
put
his
clenched
hands
on
his
hips
and
began
trotting
around
in
a
ridiculously
important
manner
the
crowd
laughed
at
his
antics
and
clapped
their
hands
the
officer
glared
at
me
angrily
how
was
it
going
to
end
i
was
rather
ill
at
ease
if
vitalis
were
there
he
could
reply
to
the
officer
but
i
was
alone
if
he
ordered
me
away
what
should
i
say
the
policeman
strode
back
and
forth
outside
the
ropes
and
when
he
passed
near
me
he
had
a
way
of
looking
at
me
over
his
shoulder
that
did
not
reassure
me
did
not
understand
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
so
he
gleefully
strutted
along
inside
the
ropes
side
by
side
with
the
officer
mimicking
his
every
movement
as
he
passed
me
he
also
looked
at
me
over
his
shoulder
in
such
a
comical
manner
that
the
people
laughed
still
louder
i
thought
the
matter
had
gone
far
enough
so
i
called
but
he
was
in
no
mood
to
obey
and
continued
his
walk
running
and
dodging
me
when
i
tried
to
catch
him
i
do
know
how
it
happened
but
the
policeman
probably
mad
with
rage
thought
that
i
was
encouraging
the
monkey
for
he
quickly
jumped
the
ropes
in
a
moment
he
was
upon
me
and
had
knocked
me
to
the
ground
with
one
blow
when
i
opened
my
eyes
and
got
to
my
feet
vitalis
who
had
sprung
from
i
do
know
where
stood
before
me
he
had
just
seized
the
policeman
wrist
i
forbid
you
to
strike
that
child
he
cried
what
a
cowardly
thing
to
do
for
some
moments
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
the
officer
was
purple
with
rage
my
master
was
superb
he
held
his
beautiful
white
head
high
his
face
expressed
indignation
and
command
his
look
was
enough
to
make
the
policeman
sink
into
the
earth
but
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
he
wrenched
his
hand
free
seized
my
master
by
the
collar
and
roughly
pushed
him
before
him
vitalis
stumbled
and
almost
fell
but
he
drew
himself
up
quickly
and
with
his
free
hand
struck
the
officer
on
the
wrist
my
master
was
a
strong
man
but
still
he
was
an
old
man
and
the
policeman
was
young
and
robust
i
saw
how
a
struggle
would
end
but
there
was
no
struggle
you
come
along
with
me
said
the
officer
you
under
arrest
why
did
you
strike
that
child
demanded
vitalis
no
talk
follow
me
vitalis
did
not
reply
but
turned
round
to
me
go
back
to
the
inn
he
said
and
stay
there
with
the
dogs
i
send
word
to
you
he
had
no
chance
to
say
more
for
the
officer
dragged
him
off
so
ended
the
performance
that
my
poor
master
had
wanted
to
make
amusing
the
dogs
at
first
had
followed
their
master
but
i
called
them
back
and
accustomed
to
obey
they
returned
to
me
i
noticed
that
they
were
muzzled
but
instead
of
their
faces
being
inclosed
in
the
usual
they
simply
wore
a
pretty
piece
of
silk
fastened
round
their
noses
and
tied
under
their
chins
capi
who
was
white
wore
red
zerbino
who
was
black
wore
white
and
dulcie
who
was
gray
wore
blue
my
poor
master
had
thus
carried
out
the
order
of
the
law
the
public
had
quickly
dispersed
a
few
stragglers
remained
to
discuss
what
had
happened
the
old
man
was
right
he
was
wrong
why
did
the
cop
strike
the
boy
he
did
nothing
to
him
never
said
a
word
bad
business
the
old
fellow
will
go
to
jail
for
sure
i
went
back
to
the
inn
depressed
i
had
grown
very
fond
of
my
master
more
and
more
every
day
we
lived
the
same
life
together
from
morning
till
night
and
often
from
night
to
morning
when
we
had
to
sleep
on
the
same
bed
of
straw
no
father
could
have
shown
more
care
for
his
child
than
he
showed
for
me
he
had
taught
me
to
read
to
sing
and
to
write
during
our
long
tramps
he
gave
me
lessons
first
on
one
subject
then
on
another
on
very
cold
days
he
shared
his
coverings
with
me
on
hot
days
he
had
always
helped
me
carry
the
bags
and
the
various
things
which
i
was
supposed
to
carry
and
when
we
ate
he
never
served
me
the
worst
piece
keeping
the
best
for
himself
on
the
contrary
he
shared
it
equally
the
good
and
the
bad
it
is
true
he
sometimes
pulled
my
ears
more
roughly
than
i
liked
but
if
i
needed
the
correction
what
of
that
in
a
word
i
loved
him
and
he
loved
me
for
how
long
would
they
send
him
to
prison
what
should
i
do
during
that
time
how
should
i
live
vitalis
was
in
the
habit
of
carrying
his
money
on
him
and
he
had
not
had
time
to
give
me
anything
before
he
was
dragged
off
i
had
only
a
few
sous
in
my
pocket
would
it
be
enough
to
buy
food
for
the
dogs
and
myself
i
spent
the
next
two
days
in
agony
not
daring
to
leave
the
inn
the
monkey
and
the
dogs
were
also
very
downcast
at
last
on
the
third
day
a
man
brought
me
a
letter
from
him
vitalis
wrote
me
that
on
the
following
saturday
he
was
to
be
tried
for
resisting
police
authority
and
for
attacking
an
officer
i
was
wrong
to
get
into
a
temper
he
wrote
this
may
cost
me
dearly
but
it
is
too
late
now
come
to
the
court
you
will
learn
a
lesson
then
he
gave
me
some
advice
and
sent
his
love
to
me
telling
me
to
caress
the
animals
for
him
while
i
was
reading
the
letter
capi
standing
between
my
feet
put
his
nose
to
the
paper
and
sniffed
it
i
could
see
by
the
way
he
wagged
his
tail
that
he
knew
it
had
come
from
his
master
this
was
the
first
time
in
three
days
that
he
had
showed
any
signs
of
joy
i
got
to
the
court
early
on
saturday
morning
many
of
the
people
who
had
witnessed
the
scene
with
the
policeman
were
present
i
was
so
scared
at
being
in
court
that
i
got
behind
a
large
stove
and
squeezed
up
as
small
as
i
could
against
the
wall
some
men
who
had
been
arrested
for
robbery
others
for
fighting
were
tried
first
all
said
that
they
were
innocent
but
all
were
found
guilty
at
last
vitalis
was
brought
in
he
sat
down
on
a
bench
between
two
policemen
what
he
said
at
first
and
what
they
asked
him
i
scarcely
knew
my
emotion
was
so
great
i
stared
at
vitalis
he
stood
upright
his
white
head
thrown
back
he
looked
ashamed
and
worried
i
looked
at
the
judge
you
gave
blows
to
the
officer
who
arrested
you
said
the
judge
not
blows
your
honor
said
vitalis
i
only
struck
once
when
i
got
to
the
place
where
we
were
to
give
our
performance
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
officer
fell
a
child
to
the
ground
with
a
blow
the
little
boy
who
is
with
me
the
child
is
not
yours
no
but
i
love
him
as
my
own
son
when
i
saw
him
struck
i
lost
my
temper
and
seized
the
policeman
arm
so
that
he
could
not
strike
again
you
struck
him
when
he
laid
his
hands
on
me
i
thought
of
him
only
as
a
man
not
as
a
police
officer
the
officer
then
said
what
he
had
to
say
vitalis
eyes
roamed
around
the
room
i
knew
that
he
was
looking
to
see
if
i
were
there
so
i
decided
to
come
out
of
my
hiding
place
and
elbowing
through
the
crowd
of
people
i
came
and
stood
beside
him
his
face
lit
up
when
he
saw
me
presently
the
trial
ended
he
was
sentenced
to
two
months
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
one
hundred
francs
two
months
prison
the
door
through
which
vitalis
had
entered
was
opened
through
my
tears
i
saw
him
follow
a
policeman
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
two
months
separation
where
should
i
go
chapter
x
homeless
when
i
returned
to
the
inn
with
heavy
heart
and
red
eyes
the
landlord
was
standing
in
the
yard
i
was
going
to
pass
him
to
get
to
my
dogs
but
he
stopped
me
well
what
about
your
master
he
asked
he
is
sentenced
how
long
two
months
prison
how
much
fine
one
hundred
francs
two
months
one
hundred
francs
he
repeated
two
or
three
times
i
wanted
to
go
on
but
again
he
stopped
me
what
are
you
going
to
do
these
two
months
i
do
know
sir
oh
you
do
know
you
got
some
money
to
live
on
and
to
buy
food
for
your
animals
i
suppose
no
sir
then
do
you
count
on
me
keeping
you
no
sir
i
do
count
on
any
one
that
was
true
i
did
not
count
upon
any
one
your
master
already
owes
me
a
lot
of
money
he
continued
i
board
you
for
two
months
without
knowing
if
i
shall
be
paid
have
to
go
go
where
shall
i
go
sir
that
not
my
business
i
nothing
to
you
why
should
i
keep
you
for
a
moment
i
was
dazed
the
man
was
right
why
should
he
give
me
shelter
come
take
your
dogs
and
monkey
and
get
out
of
course
you
must
leave
your
master
bag
with
me
when
he
comes
out
of
jail
he
come
here
to
get
it
and
then
he
can
settle
his
account
an
idea
came
to
me
as
you
know
he
will
settle
his
bill
then
ca
you
keep
me
until
then
and
add
what
i
cost
to
it
ah
ah
your
master
might
be
able
to
pay
for
two
days
lodging
but
two
months
that
a
different
thing
i
eat
as
little
as
you
wish
and
your
dogs
and
monkey
no
be
off
you
pick
up
enough
in
the
villages
but
sir
how
will
my
master
find
me
when
he
comes
out
of
prison
come
to
look
for
me
here
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
come
back
on
that
day
and
if
he
writes
to
me
i
keep
the
letter
but
if
i
do
answer
him
oh
stop
your
talk
hurry
up
and
get
out
i
give
you
five
minutes
if
i
find
you
here
when
i
come
out
again
i
settle
you
i
knew
it
was
useless
to
plead
with
him
i
had
to
get
out
i
went
to
the
stables
to
get
the
dogs
and
then
strapping
my
harp
on
my
shoulder
i
left
the
inn
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
out
of
town
for
my
dogs
were
not
muzzled
what
should
i
say
if
i
met
a
policeman
that
i
had
no
money
it
was
the
truth
i
had
only
eleven
sous
in
my
pocket
that
was
not
enough
to
buy
muzzles
they
might
arrest
me
if
vitalis
and
i
were
both
in
prison
whatever
would
become
of
the
animals
i
felt
the
responsibility
of
my
position
as
i
walked
along
quickly
the
dogs
looked
up
at
me
in
a
way
i
could
not
fail
to
understand
they
were
hungry
whom
i
carried
pulled
my
ear
from
time
to
time
to
force
me
to
look
at
him
then
he
rubbed
his
stomach
in
a
manner
that
was
no
less
expressive
than
the
looks
the
dogs
cast
at
me
i
also
was
hungry
we
had
had
no
breakfast
my
eleven
sous
could
not
buy
enough
for
dinner
and
supper
so
we
should
have
to
be
satisfied
with
one
meal
which
if
we
took
it
in
the
middle
of
the
day
would
serve
us
for
two
i
wandered
along
i
did
not
care
where
i
went
it
was
all
the
same
to
me
for
i
did
not
know
the
country
the
question
of
finding
a
place
in
which
to
sleep
did
not
worry
me
we
could
sleep
in
the
open
air
but
to
eat
we
must
have
walked
for
about
two
hours
before
i
dared
to
stop
and
yet
the
dogs
had
looked
up
at
me
imploringly
and
had
pulled
my
ear
and
rubbed
his
stomach
incessantly
at
last
i
felt
that
i
was
far
enough
away
from
the
town
to
have
nothing
to
fear
i
went
into
the
first
bakery
that
i
came
across
i
asked
for
one
pound
and
a
half
of
bread
you
do
well
to
take
a
loaf
said
the
woman
that
not
too
much
for
your
menagerie
you
must
feed
the
poor
dogs
oh
no
it
was
not
too
much
for
my
menagerie
but
it
was
too
much
for
my
purse
the
bread
was
five
sous
a
pound
two
pounds
would
cost
ten
sous
i
did
not
think
it
wise
to
be
extravagant
before
knowing
what
i
was
going
to
do
the
next
day
i
told
the
woman
in
an
offhand
manner
that
one
pound
and
a
half
was
quite
enough
and
politely
asked
her
not
to
cut
more
i
left
the
shop
with
my
bread
clutched
tightly
in
my
arms
the
dogs
jumped
joyfully
around
me
pulled
my
hair
and
chuckled
with
glee
we
did
not
go
far
at
the
first
tree
that
we
saw
i
placed
my
harp
against
the
trunk
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
the
dogs
sat
opposite
me
capi
in
the
middle
dulcie
at
one
side
zerbino
on
the
other
who
was
not
tired
stood
up
on
the
watch
ready
to
snatch
the
first
piece
that
he
could
to
eke
out
the
meal
was
a
delicate
matter
i
cut
the
bread
into
five
parts
as
near
the
same
size
as
possible
and
distributed
the
slices
i
gave
each
a
piece
in
turn
as
though
i
were
dealing
cards
who
required
less
food
than
we
fared
better
for
he
was
quite
satisfied
while
we
were
still
famished
i
took
three
pieces
from
his
share
and
hid
them
in
my
bag
to
give
the
dogs
later
then
as
there
still
remained
a
little
piece
i
broke
it
and
we
each
had
some
that
was
for
dessert
after
the
meal
i
felt
that
the
moment
had
come
for
me
to
say
a
few
words
to
my
companions
although
i
was
their
chief
i
did
not
feel
that
i
was
too
much
above
them
not
to
wish
them
to
take
part
in
the
grave
situation
in
which
we
found
ourselves
capi
had
probably
guessed
my
intentions
for
he
sat
with
his
big
intelligent
eyes
fixed
on
me
yes
capi
i
said
and
you
dulcie
zerbino
and
my
friends
i
bad
news
for
you
we
sha
see
our
master
for
two
whole
months
ouah
barked
capi
it
bad
for
him
and
it
also
bad
for
us
for
we
depend
on
him
for
everything
and
now
he
gone
we
have
any
money
at
the
mention
of
the
word
money
which
he
perfectly
understood
capi
rose
on
his
hind
paws
and
commenced
to
trot
round
as
though
he
were
collecting
money
from
the
distinguished
audience
i
see
you
want
to
give
a
performance
capi
i
continued
that
good
advice
but
should
we
make
anything
that
the
question
we
have
only
three
sous
left
so
you
must
get
hungry
you
all
to
be
very
obedient
that
will
make
it
easier
for
us
all
you
must
help
me
all
you
can
you
dogs
and
i
want
to
feel
that
i
can
count
on
you
i
would
not
make
so
bold
as
to
say
that
they
understood
all
i
said
but
they
got
the
general
idea
they
knew
by
our
master
absence
that
something
serious
had
happened
and
they
had
expected
an
explanation
from
me
if
they
did
not
understand
all
that
i
said
to
them
they
were
at
least
satisfied
that
i
had
their
welfare
at
heart
and
they
showed
their
satisfaction
by
the
attention
they
gave
me
attention
yes
on
the
part
of
the
dogs
only
it
was
impossible
for
to
keep
still
for
long
he
could
not
fix
his
mind
upon
one
subject
for
more
than
a
minute
during
the
first
part
of
my
discourse
he
had
listened
to
me
with
the
greatest
interest
but
before
i
had
said
twenty
words
he
had
sprung
up
into
a
tree
the
branches
of
which
hung
over
our
heads
and
was
now
swinging
himself
from
branch
to
branch
if
capi
had
insulted
me
in
like
manner
my
pride
would
certainly
have
been
hurt
but
i
was
never
astonished
at
anything
might
do
he
was
so
but
after
all
it
was
quite
natural
that
he
should
want
to
have
a
little
fun
i
admit
that
i
would
liked
to
have
done
the
same
i
would
have
gone
up
that
tree
with
pleasure
but
the
importance
and
dignity
of
my
present
office
did
not
permit
me
any
such
distractions
after
we
had
rested
a
while
i
gave
the
sign
to
start
we
had
to
find
a
place
somewhere
to
lie
down
for
the
night
and
gain
a
few
sous
for
our
food
for
the
next
day
we
walked
for
one
hour
then
came
in
sight
of
a
village
i
quickly
dressed
my
troop
and
in
as
good
marching
order
as
possible
we
made
our
entry
unfortunately
we
had
no
fife
and
we
lacked
vitalis
fine
commanding
presence
like
a
drum
major
he
always
attracted
the
eye
i
had
not
the
advantage
of
being
tall
nor
was
i
possessed
of
a
wonderful
head
quite
the
reverse
i
was
small
and
thin
and
i
must
have
worn
a
very
anxious
look
while
marching
i
glanced
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
to
see
what
effect
we
were
producing
very
little
i
regret
to
say
no
one
followed
us
upon
reaching
the
small
square
upon
which
was
a
fountain
shaded
with
trees
i
took
my
harp
and
commenced
to
play
a
waltz
the
music
was
gay
my
fingers
were
light
but
my
heart
was
heavy
i
told
zerbino
and
dulcie
to
waltz
together
they
obeyed
me
at
once
and
commenced
to
whirl
round
keeping
time
but
no
one
put
themselves
out
to
come
and
see
us
and
yet
in
the
doorways
i
saw
several
women
knitting
and
talking
i
continued
to
play
zerbino
and
dulcie
went
on
with
their
waltz
perhaps
if
one
decided
to
come
over
to
us
a
second
would
come
then
more
and
more
i
played
on
and
on
zerbino
and
dulcie
went
round
and
round
but
the
women
in
the
doorways
did
not
even
look
over
at
us
it
was
discouraging
but
i
was
determined
not
to
be
discouraged
i
played
with
all
my
might
making
the
cords
of
my
harp
vibrate
almost
to
breaking
them
suddenly
a
little
child
taking
its
first
steps
trotted
from
his
home
and
came
towards
us
no
doubt
the
mother
would
follow
him
and
after
the
mother
a
friend
would
come
and
we
should
have
an
audience
and
then
a
little
money
i
played
more
softly
so
as
not
to
frighten
the
baby
and
also
to
entice
him
to
come
nearer
with
hands
held
out
and
swaying
first
on
one
foot
then
on
the
other
he
came
on
slowly
a
few
steps
more
and
he
would
have
reached
us
but
at
that
moment
the
mother
looked
round
she
saw
her
baby
at
once
but
instead
of
running
after
him
as
i
had
thought
she
would
she
called
to
him
and
the
child
obediently
turned
round
and
went
back
to
her
perhaps
these
people
did
not
like
dance
music
it
was
quite
possible
i
told
zerbino
and
dulcie
to
lie
down
and
i
began
to
sing
my
never
did
i
try
so
hard
to
please
i
had
reached
the
end
of
the
second
line
when
i
saw
a
man
in
a
round
jacket
and
i
felt
that
he
was
coming
towards
me
at
last
i
tried
to
sing
with
even
more
fervor
hello
what
are
you
doing
here
young
rogue
he
cried
i
stopped
amazed
at
his
words
and
watched
him
coming
nearer
with
my
mouth
open
what
are
you
doing
here
i
say
singing
sir
have
you
got
permission
to
sing
on
a
public
square
in
our
village
no
sir
well
be
off
if
you
do
i
have
you
arrested
but
sir
be
off
you
little
beggar
i
knew
from
my
poor
master
example
what
it
would
cost
me
if
i
went
against
the
town
authorities
i
did
not
make
him
repeat
his
order
i
hurried
off
beggar
that
was
not
fair
i
had
not
begged
i
had
sung
in
five
minutes
i
had
left
behind
me
this
inhospitable
but
well
guarded
village
my
dogs
followed
me
with
their
heads
lowered
and
their
tails
between
their
legs
they
certainly
knew
that
some
bad
luck
had
befallen
us
capi
from
time
to
time
went
ahead
of
us
and
turned
round
to
look
at
me
questioningly
with
his
intelligent
eyes
any
one
else
in
his
place
would
have
questioned
me
but
capi
was
too
well
bred
to
be
indiscreet
i
saw
his
lip
tremble
in
the
effort
he
made
to
keep
back
his
protests
when
we
were
far
enough
away
from
the
village
i
signed
to
them
to
stop
and
the
three
dogs
made
a
circle
round
me
capi
in
the
middle
his
eyes
on
mine
as
we
had
no
permission
to
play
they
sent
us
away
i
explained
well
then
asked
capi
with
a
wag
of
his
head
so
then
we
shall
have
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
and
go
without
supper
at
the
word
supper
there
was
a
general
bark
i
showed
them
my
three
sous
you
know
that
is
all
we
have
if
we
spend
those
three
sous
we
shall
have
nothing
left
for
breakfast
so
as
we
have
had
something
it
is
better
to
save
this
and
i
put
my
three
sous
back
in
my
pocket
capi
and
dulcie
bent
their
heads
resignedly
but
zerbino
who
was
not
so
good
and
who
besides
was
a
gourmand
continued
to
growl
i
looked
at
him
severely
capi
explain
to
zerbino
he
does
seem
to
understand
i
said
to
faithful
capi
at
once
tapped
zerbino
with
his
paw
it
seemed
as
though
an
argument
was
taking
place
between
the
two
dogs
one
may
find
the
word
argument
too
much
when
applied
to
dogs
but
animals
certainly
have
a
peculiar
language
of
their
kind
as
to
dogs
they
not
only
know
how
to
speak
they
know
how
to
read
look
at
them
with
their
noses
in
the
air
or
with
lowered
head
sniffing
at
the
ground
smelling
the
bushes
and
stones
suddenly
they
stop
before
a
clump
of
grass
or
a
wall
and
remain
on
the
alert
for
a
moment
we
see
nothing
on
the
wall
but
the
dog
reads
all
sorts
of
curious
things
written
in
mysterious
letters
which
we
do
not
understand
what
capi
said
to
zerbino
i
did
not
hear
for
if
dogs
can
understand
the
language
of
men
men
do
not
understand
their
language
i
only
saw
that
zerbino
refused
to
listen
to
reason
and
that
he
insisted
that
the
three
sous
should
be
spent
immediately
capi
got
angry
and
it
was
only
when
he
showed
his
teeth
that
zerbino
who
was
a
bit
of
a
coward
lapsed
into
silence
the
word
silence
is
also
used
advisedly
i
mean
by
silence
that
he
laid
down
the
weather
was
beautiful
so
that
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
was
not
a
serious
matter
the
only
thing
was
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
wolves
if
there
were
any
in
this
part
of
the
country
we
walked
straight
ahead
on
the
white
road
until
we
found
a
place
we
had
reached
a
wood
here
and
there
were
great
blocks
of
granite
the
place
was
very
mournful
and
lonely
but
there
was
no
better
and
i
thought
that
we
might
find
shelter
from
the
damp
night
air
amongst
the
granite
when
i
say
we
i
mean
and
myself
for
the
dogs
would
not
catch
cold
sleeping
out
of
doors
i
had
to
be
careful
of
myself
for
i
knew
how
heavy
was
my
responsibility
what
would
become
of
us
all
if
i
fell
ill
and
what
would
become
of
me
if
i
had
to
nurse
we
found
a
sort
of
grotto
between
the
stones
strewn
with
dried
leaves
this
was
very
nice
all
that
was
lacking
was
something
to
eat
i
tried
not
to
think
that
we
were
hungry
does
not
the
proverb
say
he
who
sleeps
eats
before
lying
down
i
told
capi
that
i
relied
upon
him
to
keep
watch
and
the
faithful
dog
instead
of
sleeping
with
us
on
the
pine
leaves
laid
down
like
a
sentinel
at
the
entrance
of
our
quarters
i
could
sleep
in
peace
for
i
knew
that
none
would
come
near
without
me
being
warned
by
capi
yet
although
at
rest
on
this
point
i
could
not
sleep
at
once
was
asleep
beside
me
wrapped
up
in
my
coat
zerbino
and
dulcie
were
stretched
at
my
feet
but
my
anxiety
was
greater
than
my
fatigue
this
first
day
had
been
bad
what
would
the
next
day
be
i
was
hungry
and
thirsty
and
yet
i
only
had
three
sous
how
could
i
buy
food
for
all
if
i
did
not
earn
something
the
next
day
and
the
muzzles
and
the
permission
to
sing
oh
what
was
to
be
done
perhaps
we
should
all
die
of
hunger
in
the
bushes
while
turning
over
these
questions
in
my
mind
i
looked
up
at
the
stars
which
shone
in
the
dark
sky
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
silence
everywhere
not
the
rustle
of
a
leaf
or
the
cry
of
a
bird
nor
the
rumble
of
a
cart
on
the
road
as
far
as
my
eye
could
see
stretched
space
how
alone
we
were
how
abandoned
the
tears
filled
my
eyes
poor
mother
barberin
poor
vitalis
i
was
lying
on
my
stomach
crying
into
my
hands
when
suddenly
i
felt
a
breath
pass
through
my
hair
i
turned
over
quickly
and
a
big
soft
tongue
licked
my
wet
cheek
it
was
capi
who
had
heard
me
crying
and
had
come
to
comfort
me
as
he
had
done
on
the
first
day
of
my
wanderings
with
my
two
hands
i
took
him
by
the
neck
and
kissed
him
on
his
wet
nose
he
uttered
two
or
three
little
mournful
snorts
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
crying
with
me
i
slept
when
i
awoke
it
was
full
day
and
capi
was
sitting
beside
me
looking
at
me
the
birds
were
singing
in
the
trees
in
the
distance
i
could
hear
a
church
bell
ringing
the
angelus
the
morning
prayer
the
sun
was
already
high
in
the
sky
throwing
its
bright
rays
down
to
comfort
heart
and
body
we
started
off
going
in
the
direction
of
the
village
where
we
should
surely
find
a
baker
when
one
goes
to
bed
without
dinner
or
supper
one
is
hungry
early
in
the
morning
i
made
up
my
mind
to
spend
the
three
sous
and
after
that
we
would
see
what
would
happen
upon
arriving
in
the
village
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
ask
where
the
baker
lived
our
noses
guided
us
straight
to
the
shop
my
sense
of
smell
was
now
as
keen
as
that
of
my
dogs
from
the
distance
i
sniffed
the
delicious
odor
of
hot
bread
we
could
not
get
much
for
three
sous
when
it
costs
five
sous
a
pound
each
of
us
had
but
a
little
piece
so
our
breakfast
was
soon
over
we
to
make
money
that
day
i
walked
through
the
village
to
find
a
favorable
place
for
a
performance
and
also
to
note
the
expressions
of
the
people
to
try
and
guess
if
they
were
enemies
or
friends
my
intention
was
not
to
give
the
performance
at
once
it
was
too
early
but
after
finding
a
place
we
would
come
back
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
take
a
chance
i
was
engrossed
with
this
idea
when
suddenly
i
heard
some
one
shouting
behind
me
i
turned
round
quickly
and
saw
zerbino
racing
towards
me
followed
by
an
old
woman
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
know
what
was
the
matter
profiting
by
my
preoccupation
zerbino
had
run
into
a
house
and
stolen
a
piece
of
meat
he
was
racing
alone
carrying
his
booty
in
his
jaws
thief
thief
cried
the
old
woman
catch
him
catch
all
of
when
i
heard
her
say
this
i
felt
that
somehow
i
was
guilty
or
at
least
that
i
was
responsible
for
zerbino
crime
so
i
began
to
run
what
could
i
say
to
the
old
woman
if
she
demanded
the
price
of
the
stolen
meat
how
could
i
pay
her
if
we
were
arrested
they
would
put
us
in
prison
seeing
me
flying
down
the
road
dulcie
and
capi
were
not
long
following
my
example
they
were
at
my
heels
while
whom
i
carried
on
my
shoulder
clung
round
my
neck
so
as
not
to
fall
some
one
else
cried
stop
thief
and
others
joined
in
the
chase
but
we
raced
on
fear
gave
us
speed
i
never
saw
dulcie
run
so
fast
her
feet
barely
touched
the
ground
down
a
side
street
and
across
a
field
we
went
and
soon
we
had
outstripped
our
pursuers
but
i
did
not
stop
running
until
i
was
quite
out
of
breath
we
had
raced
at
least
two
miles
i
turned
round
no
one
was
following
us
capi
and
dulcie
were
still
at
my
heels
zerbino
was
in
the
distance
he
had
stopped
probably
to
eat
his
piece
of
meat
i
called
him
but
he
knew
very
well
that
he
deserved
a
severe
punishment
so
instead
of
coming
to
me
he
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
he
was
famished
that
was
why
he
had
stolen
the
meat
but
i
could
not
accept
this
as
an
excuse
he
had
stolen
if
i
wanted
to
preserve
discipline
in
my
troop
the
guilty
one
must
be
punished
if
not
in
the
next
village
dulcie
would
do
the
same
and
then
capi
would
succumb
to
the
temptation
i
should
have
to
punish
zerbino
publicly
but
in
order
to
do
that
i
should
have
to
catch
him
and
that
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
do
i
turned
to
capi
go
and
find
zerbino
i
said
gravely
he
started
off
at
once
to
do
what
i
told
him
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
went
with
less
ardor
than
usual
from
the
look
that
he
gave
me
i
saw
that
he
would
far
rather
champion
zerbino
than
be
my
envoy
i
sat
down
to
await
his
return
with
the
prisoner
i
was
pleased
to
get
a
rest
after
our
mad
race
when
we
stopped
running
we
had
reached
the
bank
of
a
canal
with
shady
trees
and
fields
on
either
side
an
hour
passed
the
dogs
had
not
returned
i
was
beginning
to
feel
anxious
when
at
last
capi
appeared
alone
his
head
hanging
down
where
is
zerbino
capi
laid
down
in
a
cowed
attitude
i
looked
at
him
and
noticed
that
one
of
his
ears
was
bleeding
i
knew
what
had
happened
zerbino
had
put
up
a
fight
i
felt
that
although
capi
had
obeyed
my
orders
he
had
considered
that
i
was
too
severe
and
had
let
himself
be
beaten
i
could
not
scold
him
i
could
only
wait
until
zerbino
chose
to
return
i
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
feel
sorry
and
would
come
back
and
take
his
punishment
i
stretched
myself
out
under
a
tree
holding
tight
for
fear
he
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
join
zerbino
dulcie
and
capi
slept
at
my
feet
time
passed
zerbino
did
not
appear
at
last
i
also
dropped
off
to
sleep
several
hours
had
passed
when
i
awoke
by
the
sun
i
could
tell
that
it
was
getting
late
but
there
was
no
need
for
the
sun
to
tell
me
that
my
stomach
cried
out
that
it
was
a
long
time
since
i
had
eaten
that
piece
of
bread
and
i
could
tell
from
the
looks
of
the
two
dogs
and
that
they
were
famished
capi
and
dulcie
fixed
their
eyes
on
me
piteously
made
grimaces
but
still
zerbino
had
not
come
back
i
called
to
him
i
whistled
but
in
vain
having
well
lunched
he
was
probably
digesting
his
meal
cuddled
up
in
a
bush
the
situation
was
becoming
serious
if
i
left
this
spot
zerbino
perhaps
would
get
lost
for
he
might
not
be
able
to
find
us
then
if
i
stayed
there
was
no
chance
of
me
making
a
little
money
to
buy
something
to
eat
our
hunger
became
more
acute
the
dogs
fixed
their
eyes
on
me
imploringly
and
rubbed
his
stomach
and
squealed
angrily
still
zerbino
did
not
return
once
more
i
sent
capi
to
look
for
the
truant
but
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
came
back
alone
what
was
to
be
done
although
zerbino
was
guilty
and
through
his
fault
we
were
put
into
this
terrible
position
i
could
not
forsake
him
what
would
my
master
say
if
i
did
not
take
his
three
dogs
back
to
him
and
then
in
spite
of
all
i
loved
zerbino
the
rogue
i
decided
to
wait
until
evening
but
it
was
impossible
to
remain
inactive
if
we
were
doing
something
i
thought
we
might
not
feel
the
pangs
of
hunger
so
keenly
if
i
could
invent
something
to
distract
us
we
might
for
the
time
being
forget
that
we
were
so
famished
what
could
we
do
i
pondered
over
the
question
then
i
remembered
that
vitalis
had
told
me
that
when
a
regiment
was
tired
out
by
a
long
march
the
band
played
the
gayest
airs
so
that
the
soldiers
should
forget
their
fatigue
if
i
played
some
gay
pieces
on
my
harp
perhaps
we
could
forget
our
hunger
we
were
all
so
faint
and
sick
yet
if
i
played
something
lively
and
made
the
two
poor
dogs
dance
with
the
time
might
pass
quicker
i
took
my
instrument
which
i
had
placed
up
against
a
tree
and
turning
my
back
to
the
canal
i
put
my
animals
in
position
and
began
to
play
a
dance
at
first
neither
the
dogs
nor
the
monkey
seemed
disposed
to
dance
all
they
wanted
was
food
my
heart
ached
as
i
watched
their
pitiful
attitude
but
they
must
forget
their
hunger
poor
little
things
i
played
louder
and
quicker
then
little
by
little
the
music
produced
its
customary
effect
they
danced
and
i
played
on
and
on
suddenly
i
heard
a
clear
voice
a
child
voice
call
out
bravo
the
voice
came
from
behind
me
i
turned
round
quickly
a
barge
had
stopped
on
the
canal
the
two
horses
which
dragged
the
boat
were
standing
on
the
opposite
bank
it
was
a
strange
barge
i
had
never
seen
one
like
it
it
was
much
shorter
than
the
other
boats
on
the
canal
and
the
deck
was
fashioned
like
a
beautiful
veranda
covered
with
plants
and
foliage
i
could
see
two
people
a
lady
who
was
still
young
with
a
beautiful
sad
face
and
a
boy
about
my
own
age
who
seemed
to
be
lying
down
it
was
evidently
the
little
boy
who
had
called
out
bravo
i
was
very
surprised
at
seeing
them
i
lifted
my
hat
to
thank
them
for
their
applause
are
you
playing
for
your
own
pleasure
asked
the
lady
speaking
french
with
a
foreign
accent
i
am
keeping
the
dogs
in
practice
and
also
it
diverts
their
attention
the
child
said
something
the
lady
bent
over
him
will
you
play
again
she
then
asked
turning
round
to
me
would
i
play
play
for
an
audience
who
had
arrived
at
such
a
moment
i
did
not
wait
to
be
asked
twice
would
you
like
a
dance
or
a
little
comedy
i
asked
oh
a
comedy
cried
the
child
but
the
lady
said
she
preferred
a
dance
a
dance
is
too
short
said
the
boy
if
the
audience
wishes
after
the
dance
we
will
perform
our
different
r√¥les
this
was
one
of
my
master
fine
phrases
i
tried
to
say
it
in
the
same
grand
manner
as
he
upon
second
thought
i
was
not
sorry
that
the
lady
did
not
wish
for
a
comedy
for
i
do
see
how
i
could
have
given
a
performance
not
only
was
zerbino
absent
but
i
had
none
of
the
stage
fittings
with
me
i
played
the
first
bars
of
a
waltz
capi
took
dulcie
by
the
waist
with
his
two
paws
and
they
whirled
round
keeping
good
time
then
danced
alone
successively
we
went
through
all
our
repertoire
we
did
not
feel
tired
now
the
poor
little
creatures
knew
that
they
would
be
repaid
with
a
meal
and
they
did
their
best
i
also
then
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
a
dance
in
which
all
were
taking
part
zerbino
came
out
from
behind
a
bush
and
as
capi
and
dulcie
and
passed
near
him
he
boldly
took
his
place
amongst
them
while
playing
and
watching
my
actors
i
glanced
from
time
to
time
at
the
little
boy
he
seemed
to
take
great
pleasure
in
what
we
were
doing
but
he
did
not
move
he
looked
as
though
he
was
lying
on
a
stretcher
the
boat
had
drifted
right
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
now
i
could
see
the
boy
plainly
he
had
fair
hair
his
face
was
pale
so
white
that
one
could
see
the
blue
veins
on
his
forehead
he
had
the
drawn
face
of
a
sick
child
how
much
do
you
charge
for
seats
at
your
performance
asked
the
lady
you
pay
according
to
the
pleasure
we
have
given
you
then
mamma
you
must
pay
a
lot
said
the
child
he
added
something
in
a
language
that
i
did
not
understand
my
son
would
like
to
see
your
actors
nearer
i
made
a
sign
to
capi
with
delight
he
sprang
onto
the
boat
and
the
others
cried
the
little
boy
zerbino
and
dulcie
followed
capi
example
and
the
monkey
could
have
easily
made
the
jump
but
i
was
never
sure
of
him
once
on
board
he
might
do
some
tricks
that
certainly
would
not
be
to
the
lady
taste
is
he
spiteful
she
asked
no
madam
but
he
is
not
always
obedient
and
i
am
afraid
that
he
will
not
behave
himself
well
bring
him
on
yourself
she
signed
to
a
man
who
stood
near
the
rail
he
came
forward
and
threw
a
plank
across
to
the
bank
with
my
harp
on
my
shoulder
and
in
my
arms
i
stepped
up
the
plank
the
monkey
the
monkey
cried
the
little
boy
whom
the
lady
addressed
as
arthur
i
went
up
to
him
and
while
he
stroked
and
petted
i
watched
him
he
was
strapped
to
a
board
have
you
a
father
my
child
asked
the
lady
yes
but
i
am
alone
just
now
for
long
for
two
months
two
months
oh
poor
little
boy
at
your
age
how
is
it
that
you
happen
to
be
left
all
alone
it
has
to
be
madam
does
your
father
make
you
take
him
a
sum
of
money
at
the
end
of
two
months
is
that
it
no
madam
he
does
not
force
me
to
do
anything
if
i
can
make
enough
to
live
with
my
animals
that
is
all
and
do
you
manage
to
get
enough
i
hesitated
before
replying
i
felt
a
kind
of
awe
a
reverence
for
this
beautiful
lady
yet
she
talked
to
me
so
kindly
and
her
voice
was
so
sweet
that
i
decided
to
tell
her
the
truth
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
not
then
i
told
her
how
vitalis
and
i
had
been
parted
that
he
had
gone
to
prison
because
he
had
defended
me
and
how
since
he
had
gone
i
had
been
unable
to
make
any
money
while
i
was
talking
arthur
was
playing
with
the
dogs
but
he
was
listening
to
what
i
said
then
how
hungry
you
all
must
be
he
cried
at
this
word
which
the
animals
well
knew
the
dogs
began
to
bark
and
rubbed
his
stomach
vigorously
oh
mamma
cried
arthur
the
lady
said
a
few
words
in
a
strange
language
to
a
woman
whose
head
i
could
see
through
a
half
open
door
almost
immediately
the
woman
appeared
with
some
food
sit
down
my
child
said
the
lady
i
did
so
at
once
putting
my
harp
aside
i
quickly
sat
down
in
the
chair
at
the
table
the
dogs
grouped
themselves
around
me
jumped
on
my
knee
do
your
dogs
eat
bread
asked
arthur
do
they
eat
bread
i
gave
them
a
piece
which
they
devoured
ravenously
and
the
monkey
said
arthur
but
there
was
no
occasion
to
worry
about
for
while
i
was
serving
the
dogs
he
had
taken
a
piece
of
crust
from
a
meat
pie
and
was
almost
choking
himself
underneath
the
table
i
helped
myself
to
the
pie
and
if
i
did
not
choke
like
i
gobbled
it
up
no
less
gluttonously
than
he
poor
poor
child
said
the
lady
arthur
said
nothing
but
he
looked
at
us
with
wide
open
eyes
certainly
amazed
at
our
appetites
for
we
were
all
as
famished
as
one
another
even
zerbino
who
should
have
been
somewhat
appeased
by
the
meat
that
he
had
stolen
what
would
you
have
eaten
if
you
had
not
met
us
asked
arthur
i
do
think
we
should
have
eaten
at
all
and
perhaps
we
should
have
had
the
luck
to
meet
some
one
like
we
have
arthur
then
turned
to
his
mother
for
some
minutes
they
spoke
together
in
a
foreign
language
he
seemed
to
be
asking
for
something
which
at
first
she
seemed
not
quite
willing
to
grant
then
suddenly
the
boy
turned
his
head
his
body
did
not
move
would
you
like
to
stay
with
us
he
asked
i
looked
at
him
without
replying
i
was
so
taken
back
by
the
question
my
son
wants
to
know
if
you
would
like
to
stay
with
us
repeated
the
lady
on
this
boat
yes
my
little
boy
is
ill
and
he
is
obliged
to
be
strapped
to
this
board
so
that
the
days
will
pass
more
pleasantly
for
him
i
take
him
about
in
this
boat
while
your
master
is
in
prison
if
you
like
you
may
stay
here
with
us
your
dogs
and
your
monkey
can
give
a
performance
every
day
and
arthur
and
i
will
be
the
audience
you
can
play
your
harp
for
us
you
will
be
doing
us
a
service
and
we
on
our
side
may
be
useful
to
you
to
live
on
a
boat
what
a
kind
lady
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
i
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
poor
little
boy
she
said
almost
tenderly
she
had
said
she
would
like
me
to
play
my
harp
this
simple
pleasure
i
would
give
her
at
once
i
wanted
to
show
how
grateful
i
was
i
took
my
instrument
and
going
to
the
end
of
the
boat
i
commenced
to
play
softly
the
lady
put
a
little
silver
whistle
to
her
lips
and
blew
it
i
stopped
playing
wondering
why
she
had
whistled
was
it
to
tell
me
that
i
was
playing
badly
or
to
ask
me
to
stop
arthur
who
saw
everything
that
passed
around
him
noticed
my
uneasiness
my
mamma
blew
the
whistle
for
the
horses
to
go
on
he
said
that
was
so
the
barge
towed
by
the
horses
glided
over
the
soft
waters
which
lapped
gently
against
the
keel
on
either
side
were
trees
and
behind
us
fell
the
oblique
rays
from
the
setting
sun
will
you
play
asked
arthur
he
beckoned
to
his
mother
she
sat
down
beside
him
he
took
her
hand
and
kept
it
in
his
and
i
played
to
them
all
the
pieces
that
my
master
had
taught
me
chapter
xi
another
boy
mother
arthur
mother
was
english
her
name
was
milligan
she
was
a
widow
and
arthur
was
her
only
son
at
least
it
was
supposed
that
he
was
her
only
son
living
for
she
had
lost
an
elder
child
under
mysterious
conditions
when
the
child
was
six
months
old
it
had
been
kidnaped
and
they
had
never
been
able
to
find
any
trace
of
him
it
is
true
that
at
the
time
he
was
taken
milligan
had
not
been
able
to
make
the
necessary
searches
her
husband
was
dying
and
she
herself
was
dangerously
ill
and
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
her
when
she
regained
consciousness
her
husband
was
dead
and
her
baby
had
disappeared
her
james
milligan
had
searched
everywhere
for
the
child
there
being
no
heir
he
expected
to
inherit
his
brother
property
yet
after
all
james
milligan
inherited
nothing
from
his
brother
for
seven
months
after
the
death
of
her
husband
milligan
second
son
arthur
was
born
but
the
doctors
said
that
this
frail
delicate
child
could
not
live
he
might
die
at
any
moment
in
the
event
of
his
death
james
milligan
would
succeed
to
the
fortune
he
waited
and
hoped
but
the
predictions
were
not
fulfilled
arthur
lived
it
was
his
mother
care
that
saved
him
when
he
had
to
be
strapped
to
a
board
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
her
son
being
closed
up
in
a
house
so
she
had
a
beautiful
barge
built
for
him
and
was
now
traveling
through
france
on
the
various
canals
naturally
it
was
not
the
first
day
that
i
learned
all
this
about
the
english
lady
and
her
son
i
learned
these
details
little
by
little
while
i
was
with
her
i
was
given
a
tiny
cabin
on
the
boat
what
a
wonderful
little
room
it
appeared
to
me
everything
was
spotless
the
only
article
of
furniture
that
the
cabin
contained
was
a
bureau
but
what
a
bureau
bed
mattress
pillows
and
covers
combined
and
attached
to
the
bed
were
drawers
containing
brushes
combs
etc
there
was
no
table
or
chairs
at
least
not
in
their
usual
shape
but
against
the
wall
was
a
plank
which
when
pulled
down
was
found
to
be
a
little
square
table
and
chair
how
pleased
i
was
to
get
into
that
little
bed
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
felt
soft
sheets
against
my
face
mother
barberin
were
very
hard
and
they
used
to
rub
my
cheeks
and
vitalis
and
i
had
more
often
slept
without
sheets
and
those
at
the
cheap
lodging
houses
at
which
we
stayed
were
just
as
rough
as
mother
barberin
i
woke
early
for
i
wanted
to
know
how
my
animals
had
passed
the
night
i
found
them
all
at
the
place
where
i
had
installed
them
the
night
before
and
sleeping
as
though
the
beautiful
barge
had
been
their
home
for
several
months
the
dogs
jumped
up
as
i
approached
but
although
he
had
one
eye
half
open
did
not
move
instead
he
commenced
to
snore
like
a
trombone
i
guessed
at
once
what
was
the
matter
was
very
sensitive
he
got
angry
very
quickly
and
sulked
for
a
long
time
in
the
present
circumstances
he
was
annoyed
because
i
had
not
taken
him
into
my
cabin
and
he
showed
his
displeasure
by
pretending
to
be
asleep
i
could
not
explain
to
him
why
i
had
been
forced
to
leave
him
on
deck
and
as
i
felt
that
i
had
at
least
in
appearances
done
him
an
injury
i
took
him
in
my
arms
and
cuddled
him
to
show
him
that
i
was
sorry
at
first
he
continued
to
sulk
but
soon
with
his
changeable
temper
he
thought
of
something
else
and
by
his
signs
made
me
understand
that
if
i
would
take
him
for
a
walk
on
land
he
would
perhaps
forgive
me
the
man
who
was
cleaning
the
deck
was
willing
to
throw
the
plank
across
for
us
and
i
went
off
into
the
fields
with
my
troop
the
time
passed
playing
with
the
dogs
and
chasing
when
we
returned
the
horses
were
harnessed
and
the
barge
in
readiness
to
start
as
soon
as
we
were
all
on
the
boat
the
horses
began
to
trot
along
the
towing
path
we
glided
over
the
water
without
feeling
a
movement
and
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
the
song
of
the
birds
the
swish
of
the
water
against
the
boat
and
the
tinkle
of
bells
around
the
necks
here
and
there
the
water
seemed
quite
black
as
though
it
was
of
great
depth
in
other
parts
it
was
as
clear
as
crystal
and
we
could
see
the
shiny
pebbles
and
velvety
grass
below
i
was
gazing
down
into
the
water
when
i
heard
some
one
call
my
name
it
was
arthur
he
was
being
carried
out
on
his
board
did
you
sleep
well
he
asked
better
than
in
the
field
i
told
him
that
i
had
after
i
had
politely
spoken
to
milligan
and
the
dogs
asked
arthur
i
called
to
them
they
came
running
up
with
the
latter
making
grimaces
as
he
usually
did
when
he
thought
that
we
were
going
to
give
a
performance
milligan
had
placed
her
son
in
the
shade
and
had
taken
a
seat
beside
him
now
she
said
to
me
you
must
take
the
dogs
and
the
monkey
away
we
are
going
to
work
i
went
with
the
animals
to
the
front
of
the
boat
what
work
could
that
poor
little
boy
do
i
looked
round
and
saw
that
his
mother
was
making
him
repeat
a
lesson
from
a
book
she
held
in
her
hand
he
seemed
to
be
having
great
difficulty
in
mastering
it
but
his
mother
was
very
patient
no
she
said
at
last
arthur
you
do
know
it
at
all
i
ca
mamma
i
just
ca
he
said
plaintively
i
sick
your
head
is
not
sick
i
ca
allow
you
to
grow
up
in
utter
ignorance
because
you
an
invalid
arthur
that
seemed
very
severe
to
me
yet
she
spoke
in
a
sweet
kind
way
why
do
you
make
me
so
unhappy
you
know
how
i
feel
when
you
learn
i
can
not
mamma
i
can
not
and
he
began
to
cry
but
milligan
did
not
let
herself
be
won
over
by
his
tears
although
she
appeared
touched
and
even
more
unhappy
i
would
have
liked
to
have
let
you
play
this
morning
with
remi
and
the
dogs
she
said
but
you
can
not
play
until
you
know
your
lessons
perfectly
with
that
she
gave
the
book
to
arthur
and
walked
away
leaving
him
alone
from
where
i
stood
i
could
hear
him
crying
how
could
his
mother
who
appeared
to
love
him
so
much
be
so
severe
with
the
poor
little
fellow
a
moment
later
she
returned
shall
we
try
again
she
asked
gently
she
sat
down
beside
him
and
taking
the
book
she
began
to
read
the
fable
called
the
wolf
and
the
sheep
she
read
it
through
three
times
then
gave
the
book
back
to
arthur
and
told
him
to
learn
it
alone
she
went
inside
the
boat
i
could
see
arthur
lips
moving
he
certainly
was
trying
very
hard
but
soon
he
took
his
eyes
off
the
book
his
lips
stopped
moving
his
look
wandered
everywhere
but
not
back
to
his
book
suddenly
he
caught
my
eye
i
made
a
sign
to
him
to
go
on
with
his
lesson
he
smiled
as
though
to
thank
me
for
reminding
him
and
again
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
book
but
as
before
he
could
not
concentrate
his
thoughts
his
eyes
began
to
rove
from
first
one
side
of
the
canal
to
the
other
just
then
a
bird
flew
over
the
boat
swiftly
as
an
arrow
arthur
raised
his
head
to
follow
its
flight
when
it
had
passed
he
looked
at
me
i
ca
learn
this
he
said
and
yet
i
want
to
i
went
over
to
him
it
is
not
very
difficult
i
said
yes
it
is
it
awfully
difficult
it
seems
to
me
quite
easy
i
was
listening
while
your
mother
read
it
and
i
almost
learned
it
myself
he
smiled
as
though
he
did
not
believe
it
do
you
want
me
to
say
it
to
you
you
ca
shall
i
try
you
take
the
book
he
took
up
the
book
again
and
i
began
to
recite
the
verse
i
had
it
almost
perfect
what
you
know
it
not
quite
but
next
time
i
could
say
it
without
a
mistake
i
believe
how
did
you
learn
it
i
listened
while
your
mother
read
it
but
i
listened
attentively
without
looking
about
to
see
what
was
going
on
round
about
me
he
reddened
and
turned
away
his
eyes
i
will
try
like
you
he
said
but
tell
me
what
did
you
do
to
remember
the
words
i
did
not
quite
know
how
to
explain
but
i
tried
my
best
what
is
the
fable
about
i
said
sheep
well
first
of
all
i
thought
of
sheep
the
sheep
were
in
a
field
i
could
see
them
lying
down
and
sleeping
in
the
field
picturing
them
so
i
did
not
forget
yes
yes
he
said
i
can
see
them
black
and
white
ones
in
a
green
field
what
looks
after
the
sheep
usually
dogs
and
a
shepherd
if
they
thought
the
sheep
were
quite
safe
what
did
they
do
the
dog
slept
while
the
shepherd
played
his
flute
in
the
distance
with
the
other
shepherds
little
by
little
arthur
had
the
entire
fable
pictured
in
his
mind
eye
i
explained
every
detail
as
well
as
i
was
able
when
he
was
thoroughly
interested
we
went
over
the
lines
together
and
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
had
mastered
it
oh
how
pleased
mamma
will
be
he
cried
when
his
mother
came
out
she
seemed
displeased
that
we
were
together
she
thought
that
we
had
been
playing
but
arthur
did
not
give
her
time
to
say
a
word
i
know
it
he
cried
remi
has
taught
it
to
me
milligan
looked
at
me
in
surprise
but
before
she
could
say
a
word
arthur
had
commenced
to
recite
the
fable
i
looked
at
milligan
her
beautiful
face
broke
into
a
smile
then
i
thought
i
saw
tears
in
her
eyes
but
she
bent
her
head
quickly
over
her
son
and
put
her
arms
about
him
i
was
not
sure
if
she
was
crying
the
words
mean
nothing
said
arthur
they
are
stupid
but
the
things
that
one
sees
remi
made
me
see
the
shepherd
with
his
flute
and
the
fields
and
the
dogs
and
the
sheep
then
the
wolves
and
i
could
even
hear
the
music
that
the
shepherd
was
playing
shall
i
sing
the
song
to
you
mamma
and
he
sang
a
little
sad
song
in
english
this
time
milligan
did
really
cry
for
when
she
got
up
from
her
seat
i
saw
that
arthur
cheeks
were
wet
with
her
tears
then
she
came
to
me
and
taking
my
hand
in
hers
pressed
it
gently
you
are
a
good
boy
she
said
the
evening
before
i
had
been
a
little
tramp
who
had
come
on
the
barge
with
his
animals
to
amuse
a
sick
child
but
this
lesson
drew
me
apart
from
the
dogs
and
the
monkey
i
was
from
now
a
companion
almost
a
friend
to
the
sick
boy
from
that
day
there
was
a
change
in
milligan
manner
toward
me
and
between
arthur
and
myself
there
grew
a
strong
friendship
i
never
once
felt
the
difference
in
our
positions
this
may
have
been
due
to
milligan
kindness
for
she
often
spoke
to
me
as
though
i
were
her
child
when
the
country
was
interesting
we
would
go
very
slowly
but
if
the
landscape
was
dreary
the
horses
would
trot
quickly
along
the
towing
path
when
the
sun
went
down
the
barge
stopped
when
the
sun
rose
the
barge
started
on
again
if
the
evenings
were
damp
we
went
into
the
little
cabin
and
sat
round
a
bright
fire
so
that
the
sick
boy
should
not
feel
chilly
and
milligan
would
read
to
us
and
show
us
pictures
and
tell
us
beautiful
stories
then
when
the
evenings
were
beautiful
i
did
my
part
i
would
take
my
harp
and
when
the
boat
had
stopped
i
would
get
off
and
go
at
a
short
distance
and
sit
behind
a
tree
then
hidden
by
the
branches
i
played
and
sang
my
best
on
calm
nights
arthur
liked
to
hear
the
music
without
being
able
to
see
who
played
and
when
i
played
his
favorite
airs
he
would
call
out
encore
and
i
would
play
the
piece
over
again
that
was
a
beautiful
life
for
the
country
boy
who
had
sat
by
mother
barberin
fireside
and
who
had
tramped
the
high
roads
with
signor
vitalis
what
a
difference
between
the
dish
of
boiled
potatoes
that
my
poor
foster
mother
had
given
me
and
the
delicious
tarts
jellies
and
creams
that
milligan
cook
made
what
a
contrast
between
the
long
tramps
in
the
mud
the
pouring
rain
the
scorching
sun
trudging
behind
vitalis
and
this
ride
on
the
beautiful
barge
the
pastry
was
delicious
and
yes
it
was
fine
oh
so
fine
not
to
be
hungry
nor
tired
nor
too
hot
nor
too
cold
but
in
justice
to
myself
i
must
say
that
it
was
the
kindness
and
love
of
this
lady
and
this
little
boy
that
i
felt
the
most
twice
i
had
been
torn
from
those
i
loved
first
from
dear
mother
barberin
and
then
from
vitalis
i
was
left
with
only
the
dogs
and
the
monkey
hungry
and
footsore
and
then
a
beautiful
lady
with
a
child
of
about
my
own
age
had
taken
me
in
and
treated
me
as
though
i
were
a
brother
often
as
i
looked
at
arthur
strapped
to
his
bench
pale
and
drawn
i
envied
him
i
so
full
of
health
and
strength
envied
the
little
sick
boy
it
was
not
the
luxuries
that
surrounded
him
that
i
envied
not
the
boat
it
was
his
mother
oh
how
i
wanted
a
mother
of
my
own
she
kissed
him
and
he
was
able
to
put
his
arms
around
her
whenever
he
wished
this
lady
whose
hand
i
scarcely
dared
touch
when
she
held
it
out
to
me
and
i
thought
sadly
that
i
should
never
have
a
mother
who
would
kiss
me
and
whom
i
could
kiss
perhaps
one
day
i
should
see
mother
barberin
again
and
that
would
make
me
very
happy
but
i
could
not
call
her
mother
now
for
she
was
not
my
mother
i
was
alone
i
should
always
be
alone
nobody
boy
i
was
old
enough
to
know
that
one
should
not
expect
to
have
too
much
from
this
world
and
i
thought
that
as
i
had
no
family
no
father
or
mother
i
should
be
thankful
that
i
had
friends
and
i
was
happy
so
happy
on
that
barge
but
alas
it
was
not
to
last
long
the
day
was
drawing
near
for
me
to
take
up
my
old
life
again
chapter
xii
the
master
consent
it
was
all
to
end
this
beautiful
trip
that
i
had
made
on
the
barge
no
nice
bed
no
nice
pastry
no
evenings
listening
to
milligan
ah
no
milligan
or
arthur
one
day
i
decided
to
ask
milligan
how
long
it
would
take
me
to
get
back
to
toulouse
i
wanted
to
be
waiting
at
the
prison
door
when
my
master
came
out
when
arthur
heard
me
speak
of
going
back
he
began
to
cry
i
do
want
him
to
go
i
do
want
remi
to
go
he
sobbed
i
told
him
that
i
belonged
to
vitalis
and
that
he
had
paid
a
sum
of
money
for
me
and
that
i
must
return
to
him
the
moment
he
wanted
me
i
had
spoken
of
my
foster
parents
but
had
never
said
that
they
were
not
really
my
father
and
mother
i
felt
ashamed
to
admit
that
i
was
a
foundling
a
child
picked
up
in
the
streets
i
knew
how
the
children
from
the
foundlings
hospital
had
been
scorned
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
the
most
abject
thing
in
the
world
to
be
a
foundling
i
did
not
want
milligan
and
arthur
to
know
would
they
not
have
turned
from
me
in
disdain
mamma
we
must
keep
remi
continued
arthur
i
should
be
very
pleased
to
keep
remi
with
us
replied
milligan
we
are
so
fond
of
him
but
there
are
two
things
first
remi
would
have
to
want
to
stay
oh
he
does
he
does
cried
arthur
do
you
remi
you
do
want
to
go
back
to
toulouse
the
second
is
continued
milligan
will
his
master
give
him
up
remi
comes
first
he
comes
first
arthur
insisted
vitalis
had
been
a
good
master
and
i
was
very
grateful
for
all
he
had
taught
me
but
there
was
no
comparison
between
my
life
with
him
and
that
which
i
should
have
with
arthur
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
also
no
comparison
between
the
respect
i
had
for
vitalis
and
the
affection
which
i
felt
for
milligan
and
her
invalid
boy
i
felt
that
it
was
wrong
for
me
to
prefer
these
strangers
to
my
master
but
it
was
so
i
loved
milligan
and
arthur
if
remi
stays
with
us
it
will
not
be
all
pleasure
went
on
milligan
he
would
have
to
do
lessons
the
same
as
you
he
would
have
to
study
a
great
deal
it
would
not
be
the
free
life
that
he
would
have
in
going
tramping
along
the
roads
ah
you
know
what
i
would
like
i
began
there
there
you
see
mamma
interrupted
arthur
all
that
we
have
to
do
now
continued
milligan
is
to
get
his
master
consent
i
will
write
and
ask
him
if
he
will
come
here
for
we
can
not
return
to
toulouse
i
will
send
him
his
fare
and
explain
to
him
the
reason
why
we
can
not
take
the
train
i
invite
him
here
and
i
do
hope
he
will
accept
if
he
agrees
to
my
proposition
added
milligan
i
will
then
make
arrangements
with
your
parents
remi
for
of
course
they
must
be
consulted
consult
my
parents
they
will
tell
her
what
i
have
been
trying
to
keep
secret
that
i
am
a
foundling
then
neither
arthur
nor
milligan
would
want
me
a
boy
who
did
not
know
his
own
father
or
mother
had
been
a
companion
to
arthur
i
stared
at
milligan
in
affright
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
she
looked
at
me
in
surprise
i
did
not
dare
reply
to
her
question
when
she
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
probably
thinking
that
i
was
upset
at
the
thought
of
my
master
coming
she
did
not
insist
arthur
looked
at
me
curiously
all
the
evening
i
was
glad
when
bedtime
came
and
i
could
close
myself
in
my
cabin
that
was
my
first
bad
night
on
board
the
what
could
i
do
what
say
perhaps
vitalis
would
not
give
me
up
then
they
would
never
know
the
truth
my
shame
and
fear
of
them
finding
out
the
truth
was
so
great
that
i
began
to
hope
that
vitalis
would
insist
upon
me
staying
with
him
three
days
later
milligan
received
a
reply
to
the
letter
she
had
sent
vitalis
he
said
that
he
would
be
pleased
to
come
and
see
her
and
that
he
would
arrive
the
following
saturday
by
the
two
train
i
asked
permission
to
go
to
the
station
with
the
dogs
and
to
meet
him
in
the
morning
the
dogs
were
restless
as
though
they
knew
that
something
was
going
to
happen
was
indifferent
i
was
terribly
excited
my
fate
was
to
be
decided
if
i
had
possessed
the
courage
i
would
have
implored
vitalis
not
to
tell
milligan
that
i
was
a
foundling
but
i
felt
that
i
could
not
utter
the
word
even
to
him
i
stood
on
a
corner
of
the
railway
station
holding
my
dogs
on
a
leash
with
under
my
coat
and
i
waited
i
saw
little
of
what
passed
around
me
it
was
the
dogs
who
warned
me
that
the
train
had
arrived
they
scented
their
master
suddenly
there
was
a
tug
at
the
leash
as
i
was
not
on
my
guard
they
broke
loose
with
a
bark
they
bounded
forward
i
saw
them
spring
upon
vitalis
more
sure
although
less
supple
than
the
other
two
capi
had
jumped
straight
into
his
master
arms
while
zerbino
and
dulcie
jumped
at
his
feet
when
vitalis
saw
me
he
put
capi
down
quickly
and
threw
his
arms
around
me
for
the
first
time
he
kissed
me
god
bless
you
my
boy
he
said
again
and
again
my
master
had
never
been
hard
with
me
but
neither
had
he
ever
been
affectionate
and
i
was
not
used
to
these
effusions
i
was
touched
and
the
tears
came
to
my
eyes
for
i
was
in
the
mood
when
the
heart
is
easily
stirred
i
looked
at
him
his
stay
in
prison
had
aged
him
greatly
his
back
was
bent
his
face
paler
and
his
lips
bloodless
you
find
me
changed
do
you
remi
he
said
i
was
none
too
happy
in
prison
but
i
be
better
now
i
out
then
changing
the
subject
he
added
tell
me
about
this
lady
who
wrote
to
me
how
did
you
get
to
know
her
i
told
him
how
i
had
met
milligan
and
arthur
in
their
barge
the
on
the
canal
and
of
what
we
had
seen
and
what
we
had
done
i
rambled
along
hardly
knowing
what
i
said
now
that
i
saw
vitalis
i
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
tell
him
that
i
wanted
to
leave
him
and
stay
with
milligan
we
reached
the
hotel
where
milligan
was
staying
before
my
story
was
ended
vitalis
had
not
mentioned
what
she
had
proposed
to
him
in
her
letter
so
i
said
nothing
of
her
plan
is
this
lady
expecting
me
he
asked
as
we
entered
the
hotel
yes
i
take
you
up
to
her
apartment
i
said
there
no
occasion
for
that
he
replied
i
go
up
alone
you
wait
here
for
me
with
and
the
dogs
i
had
always
obeyed
him
but
in
this
case
i
felt
that
it
was
only
fair
for
me
to
go
up
with
him
to
milligan
apartment
but
with
a
sign
he
stopped
the
words
on
my
lips
and
i
was
forced
to
stay
below
with
the
dogs
why
did
he
want
me
to
be
present
when
he
spoke
to
milligan
i
asked
myself
this
question
again
and
again
i
was
still
pondering
over
it
when
he
returned
go
and
say
to
the
lady
he
said
briefly
i
wait
for
you
here
we
shall
go
in
ten
minutes
i
was
thunderstruck
well
he
said
did
you
understand
me
you
stand
there
like
a
stupid
hurry
up
he
had
never
spoken
so
roughly
to
me
mechanically
i
got
up
to
obey
not
seeming
to
understand
what
did
you
say
to
her
i
asked
after
i
had
gone
a
few
steps
i
said
that
i
needed
you
and
that
you
needed
me
and
consequently
i
was
not
going
to
give
up
my
rights
to
you
go
i
give
you
ten
minutes
to
say
i
was
so
possessed
by
the
fact
that
i
was
a
foundling
that
i
thought
that
if
i
had
to
leave
immediately
it
was
because
my
master
had
told
them
about
my
birth
upon
entering
milligan
apartment
i
found
arthur
in
tears
and
his
mother
bending
over
him
you
wo
go
remi
oh
remi
tell
me
you
wo
go
he
sobbed
i
could
not
speak
milligan
replied
for
me
telling
arthur
that
i
had
to
do
as
i
was
told
signor
vitalis
would
not
consent
to
let
us
have
you
said
milligan
in
a
voice
so
sad
he
a
wicked
man
cried
arthur
no
he
is
not
a
wicked
man
continued
milligan
he
loves
you
and
he
needs
you
he
speaks
like
a
man
far
above
his
position
he
told
me
let
me
see
these
were
his
words
love
that
child
and
he
loves
me
the
apprenticeship
in
the
life
that
i
give
him
is
good
for
him
better
far
better
than
he
would
have
with
you
you
would
give
him
an
education
that
is
true
you
would
form
his
mind
but
not
his
character
it
is
the
hardships
of
life
that
alone
can
do
that
he
can
not
be
your
son
he
will
be
mine
that
is
better
than
to
be
a
plaything
for
your
sick
child
however
sweet
he
may
be
i
also
will
teach
the
boy
but
he
is
remi
father
cried
arthur
that
is
true
but
he
is
his
master
and
remi
belongs
to
him
for
the
time
being
remi
must
obey
him
his
parents
rented
him
to
signor
vitalis
but
i
will
write
to
them
and
see
what
i
can
do
oh
no
no
do
do
that
i
cried
what
do
you
mean
oh
no
please
do
but
that
is
the
only
thing
to
do
my
child
oh
please
please
do
if
milligan
had
not
spoken
of
my
parents
i
should
have
taken
much
more
than
the
ten
minutes
to
say
that
my
master
had
given
me
they
live
in
chavanon
do
they
not
asked
milligan
without
replying
i
went
up
to
arthur
and
putting
my
arms
round
him
clung
to
him
for
a
moment
then
freeing
myself
from
his
weak
clasp
i
turned
and
held
out
my
hand
to
milligan
poor
child
she
murmured
kissing
me
on
the
forehead
i
hurried
to
the
door
arthur
i
will
love
you
always
i
said
choking
back
my
sobs
and
i
never
never
will
forget
you
mrs
milligan
remi
remi
cried
arthur
i
closed
the
door
one
moment
later
i
was
with
vitalis
off
we
go
he
said
and
that
was
how
i
parted
from
my
first
boy
friend
chapter
xiii
weary
dreary
days
again
i
had
to
tramp
behind
my
master
with
the
harp
strapped
to
my
shoulder
through
the
rain
the
sun
the
dust
and
the
mud
i
had
to
play
the
fool
and
laugh
and
cry
in
order
to
please
the
distinguished
audience
more
than
once
in
our
long
walks
i
lagged
behind
to
think
of
arthur
his
mother
and
the
when
i
was
in
some
dirty
village
how
i
would
long
for
my
pretty
cabin
on
the
barge
and
how
rough
the
sheets
were
now
it
was
terrible
to
think
that
i
should
never
again
play
with
arthur
and
never
hear
his
mother
voice
fortunately
in
my
sorrow
which
was
very
deep
i
had
one
consolation
vitalis
was
much
kinder
kinder
than
he
had
ever
been
before
his
manner
with
me
had
quite
changed
i
felt
that
he
was
more
to
me
than
a
master
now
often
if
i
dared
i
would
have
embraced
him
i
so
needed
love
but
i
had
not
the
courage
for
vitalis
was
not
a
man
with
whom
one
dared
be
familiar
at
first
it
had
been
fear
that
kept
me
at
a
distance
but
now
it
was
something
vague
which
resembled
a
sentiment
of
respect
when
i
left
the
village
i
had
looked
upon
vitalis
the
same
as
the
other
men
of
the
poorer
class
i
was
not
able
to
make
distinctions
but
the
two
months
that
i
had
lived
with
milligan
had
opened
my
eyes
and
developed
my
intelligence
looking
at
my
master
with
more
attention
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
manner
and
bearing
he
appeared
to
be
very
superior
his
ways
were
like
milligan
ways
weeks
passed
on
our
tramps
now
my
eyes
were
always
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
water
not
to
the
hills
i
was
always
hoping
that
one
day
i
should
see
the
if
i
saw
a
boat
in
the
distance
i
always
thought
that
it
might
be
the
but
it
was
not
we
passed
several
days
at
lyons
and
all
my
spare
time
i
spent
on
the
docks
looking
up
and
down
the
river
i
described
the
beautiful
barge
to
the
fishermen
and
asked
them
if
they
had
seen
it
but
no
one
had
seen
it
we
had
to
leave
lyons
at
last
and
went
on
to
dijon
then
i
began
to
give
up
hope
of
ever
seeing
milligan
again
for
at
lyons
i
had
studied
all
the
maps
of
france
and
i
knew
that
the
could
not
go
farther
up
the
river
to
reach
the
loire
it
would
branch
off
at
chalon
we
arrived
at
chalon
and
we
went
on
again
without
seeing
it
it
was
the
end
of
my
dream
to
make
things
worse
the
winter
was
now
upon
us
and
we
had
to
tramp
along
wearily
in
the
blinding
rain
and
slush
at
night
when
we
arrived
at
a
wretched
inn
or
in
a
barn
tired
out
wet
to
the
skin
i
could
not
drop
off
to
sleep
with
laughter
on
my
lips
sometimes
we
were
frozen
to
the
bone
and
was
as
sad
and
mournful
as
myself
my
master
object
was
to
get
to
paris
as
quickly
as
possible
for
it
was
only
in
paris
that
we
had
a
chance
to
give
performances
during
the
winter
we
were
making
very
little
money
now
so
we
could
not
afford
to
take
the
train
after
the
cold
sleet
the
wind
turned
to
the
north
it
had
been
very
damp
for
several
days
at
first
we
did
not
mind
the
biting
north
wind
in
our
faces
but
soon
the
sky
filled
with
great
black
clouds
and
the
wintry
sun
disappeared
altogether
we
knew
that
a
snowstorm
was
coming
vitalis
was
anxious
to
get
to
the
next
big
town
where
we
could
stay
and
give
several
performances
if
very
bad
weather
overtook
us
go
to
bed
quickly
he
said
when
we
got
to
an
inn
that
night
we
are
going
to
start
at
a
very
early
hour
because
i
do
want
to
be
caught
in
a
snowstorm
he
did
not
go
to
bed
at
once
but
sat
down
by
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
fire
to
warm
who
was
suffering
terribly
from
the
cold
the
monkey
had
not
ceased
moaning
although
we
had
wrapped
him
up
in
plenty
of
coverlets
the
next
morning
i
got
up
early
as
i
had
been
told
it
was
not
yet
day
the
sky
was
lowering
and
black
and
there
was
not
a
star
to
be
seen
when
we
opened
the
door
a
strong
wind
almost
took
us
off
our
feet
if
i
were
in
your
place
said
the
innkeeper
to
vitalis
i
venture
out
we
going
to
have
a
terrible
snowstorm
i
in
a
hurry
replied
vitalis
and
i
want
to
get
to
troyes
before
it
comes
on
thirty
miles
nevertheless
we
started
vitalis
held
tight
against
his
body
so
as
to
give
him
some
of
his
own
warmth
and
the
dogs
pleased
with
the
hard
dry
roads
raced
before
us
my
master
had
bought
a
sheepskin
for
me
at
dijon
and
i
wrapped
myself
up
in
it
with
the
wool
inside
it
was
anything
but
agreeable
when
we
opened
our
mouths
so
we
walked
along
in
silence
hurrying
as
much
to
get
warm
as
to
get
ahead
although
it
was
long
past
the
hour
of
daybreak
the
sky
was
still
quite
black
although
to
the
east
a
whitish
band
cut
the
clouds
yet
the
sun
would
not
come
out
looking
across
the
country
objects
were
now
becoming
more
distinct
we
could
see
the
trees
stripped
of
their
leaves
and
the
shrubs
and
bushes
with
dry
foliage
rustling
and
cracking
with
the
heavy
gusts
of
wind
there
was
no
one
on
the
roads
nor
in
the
fields
not
a
sound
of
cart
wheels
nor
the
crack
of
a
whip
suddenly
in
the
distance
we
could
see
a
pale
streak
which
got
larger
and
larger
as
it
came
towards
us
then
we
heard
a
sort
of
hissing
murmur
the
strange
harsh
cry
of
the
wild
geese
the
maddened
flock
flew
over
our
heads
on
they
went
wildly
fleeing
from
the
north
towards
the
south
before
they
were
out
of
sight
soft
flakes
were
dropping
gently
from
the
skies
and
floating
in
the
atmosphere
the
country
through
which
we
tramped
was
desolate
and
bleak
the
mournful
aspect
seemed
to
add
to
the
silence
only
the
shrill
whistling
of
the
north
wind
was
heard
snowflakes
like
tiny
butterflies
fluttered
around
us
whirling
incessantly
without
touching
the
ground
we
made
little
headway
it
seemed
impossible
that
we
could
reach
troyes
before
the
storm
was
fully
upon
us
but
i
did
not
worry
i
thought
that
if
the
snow
fell
it
would
not
be
so
cold
i
did
not
know
what
a
snow
storm
could
be
it
was
not
long
before
i
learned
and
in
a
way
that
i
shall
never
forget
the
clouds
were
gathering
from
the
northwest
the
flakes
no
longer
hovered
in
the
air
but
fell
straight
and
swift
covering
us
from
head
to
foot
we
shall
have
to
take
shelter
in
the
first
house
we
come
to
murmured
vitalis
we
can
not
make
troyes
i
was
pleased
to
hear
him
say
that
but
where
could
we
find
shelter
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
there
was
not
a
house
to
be
seen
nor
anything
to
indicate
that
we
were
nearing
a
village
before
us
lay
a
forest
with
its
dark
depths
and
on
either
side
of
us
the
hills
the
snow
came
down
faster
and
thicker
we
tramped
in
silence
my
master
lifted
his
sheepskin
now
and
again
for
to
breathe
more
easily
from
time
to
time
we
had
to
turn
our
heads
to
one
side
so
that
we
also
could
breathe
the
dogs
no
longer
raced
ahead
they
walked
at
our
heels
asking
for
the
shelter
that
we
were
unable
to
give
them
we
went
slowly
and
painfully
on
blinded
wet
and
frozen
and
although
we
were
now
in
the
heart
of
the
forest
the
road
through
it
was
exposed
to
the
full
wind
several
times
i
saw
my
master
glance
to
the
left
as
though
he
were
looking
for
something
but
he
said
nothing
what
did
he
hope
to
find
i
looked
straight
before
me
down
the
long
road
as
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
i
could
see
nothing
but
woods
on
either
side
i
thought
we
should
never
come
to
the
end
of
that
forest
i
had
seen
the
snow
falling
only
through
the
window
panes
of
a
warm
kitchen
how
far
off
that
warm
kitchen
seemed
now
our
feet
sunk
into
the
white
bed
of
snow
deeper
and
deeper
then
suddenly
without
saying
a
word
vitalis
pointed
to
the
left
i
looked
and
saw
indistinctly
a
little
hut
made
of
branches
we
had
to
find
the
track
that
led
to
the
hut
this
was
difficult
for
the
snow
was
already
thick
enough
to
efface
all
trace
of
a
path
we
scrambled
through
the
bushes
and
after
crossing
a
ditch
we
managed
at
last
to
reach
the
hut
and
get
inside
the
dogs
in
ecstasy
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
dry
ground
barking
our
satisfaction
was
no
less
keen
than
theirs
i
thought
there
would
be
a
cabin
somewhere
in
the
forest
said
vitalis
now
it
can
snow
yes
let
it
snow
i
said
defiantly
i
do
care
i
went
to
the
door
or
rather
to
the
opening
of
the
hut
for
there
was
neither
door
nor
window
and
shook
my
coat
and
hat
so
as
not
to
wet
the
inside
of
our
apartment
our
quarters
were
very
simply
but
strongly
built
its
furniture
consisted
of
a
heap
of
dirt
and
some
big
stones
for
seats
in
a
house
like
this
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
fuel
we
had
only
to
take
it
down
from
the
walls
and
the
roof
dragging
out
a
few
faggots
here
and
there
this
was
quickly
done
and
soon
we
had
a
bright
flaming
fire
it
is
true
that
the
hut
was
soon
filled
with
smoke
but
what
did
that
matter
there
was
a
flame
and
it
was
heat
that
we
wanted
i
lay
down
supporting
myself
on
my
two
hands
and
blew
the
fire
the
dogs
sat
around
the
grate
gravely
with
necks
stretched
out
they
presented
their
wet
sides
to
the
flames
soon
ventured
to
peep
from
under
vitalis
coat
prudently
putting
the
end
of
his
nose
outside
he
looked
about
to
take
in
his
surroundings
evidently
satisfied
he
jumped
quickly
to
the
ground
and
taking
the
best
place
before
the
fire
he
held
out
his
two
little
trembling
hands
to
the
flames
that
morning
before
i
had
risen
vitalis
had
packed
some
provisions
there
was
some
bread
and
a
piece
of
cheese
we
all
expressed
satisfaction
at
the
sight
of
the
food
unfortunately
we
were
only
able
to
have
a
very
small
piece
for
not
knowing
how
long
we
should
have
to
stay
in
the
hut
vitalis
thought
it
advisable
to
keep
some
for
supper
i
understood
but
the
dogs
did
not
and
when
they
saw
the
bread
put
back
in
the
bag
before
they
had
scarcely
eaten
they
held
out
their
paws
to
their
master
scratching
his
neck
and
performing
pantomime
gestures
to
make
him
open
the
bag
upon
which
their
eyes
were
fixed
but
vitalis
took
no
notice
of
them
the
bag
was
not
opened
the
dogs
settled
themselves
to
go
to
sleep
capi
with
his
nose
in
the
cinders
i
thought
that
i
would
follow
their
example
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
slept
when
i
awoke
the
snow
had
stopped
falling
i
looked
outside
it
was
very
deep
if
we
ventured
out
it
would
come
above
our
knees
what
time
was
it
i
could
not
ask
vitalis
his
big
silver
watch
by
which
capi
had
told
the
hour
had
been
sold
he
had
spent
all
his
money
to
pay
his
prison
fine
and
when
he
bought
my
sheepskin
at
dijon
he
had
parted
with
his
big
watch
to
pay
for
it
from
the
misty
atmosphere
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
tell
what
hour
it
might
be
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
the
snow
seemed
to
have
petrified
every
movement
of
life
i
was
standing
in
the
opening
of
our
cabin
when
i
heard
my
master
calling
do
you
want
to
get
on
your
way
he
asked
i
do
know
i
want
to
do
what
you
wish
well
i
think
we
ought
to
stay
here
we
are
at
least
sheltered
and
have
warmth
that
was
true
but
i
remembered
that
we
had
no
food
however
i
said
nothing
i
afraid
it
will
snow
again
continued
vitalis
we
do
want
to
spend
the
night
outside
better
stay
here
yes
we
should
have
to
stay
in
the
hut
and
tighten
our
belts
round
our
stomachs
that
was
all
at
supper
vitalis
divided
the
remainder
of
the
bread
alas
there
was
but
little
and
it
was
quickly
eaten
we
gobbled
up
every
crumb
when
our
frugal
supper
was
over
i
thought
that
the
dogs
would
begin
making
signs
for
more
as
they
had
done
before
for
they
were
ravenous
but
they
did
nothing
of
the
kind
and
once
again
i
realized
how
great
was
their
intelligence
when
vitalis
thrust
his
knife
into
his
trouser
pocket
which
indicated
that
the
feast
was
over
capi
got
up
and
smelled
the
bag
in
which
the
food
was
kept
he
then
placed
his
paw
on
the
bag
to
feel
it
this
double
investigation
convinced
him
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
eat
then
coming
back
to
his
place
before
the
fire
he
looked
at
zerbino
and
dulcie
the
look
clearly
signified
that
they
would
get
nothing
more
then
he
stretched
himself
out
his
entire
length
with
a
sigh
of
resignation
there
is
nothing
more
it
is
useless
to
beg
he
said
this
to
them
as
plainly
as
though
he
had
spoken
aloud
his
companions
understanding
this
language
also
stretched
out
before
the
fire
sighing
but
zerbino
sigh
in
no
wise
betokened
resignation
for
added
to
a
large
appetite
zerbino
was
very
much
of
a
gourmand
and
this
was
a
greater
sacrifice
for
him
than
for
the
others
the
snow
had
commenced
to
fall
again
it
fell
persistently
we
could
see
the
white
carpet
on
the
ground
rise
higher
and
higher
until
the
small
shrubs
and
bushes
were
hidden
beneath
it
when
night
came
big
flakes
were
still
falling
from
the
black
sky
onto
the
shimmering
earth
as
we
had
to
sleep
there
the
best
thing
to
do
was
to
go
to
sleep
as
quickly
as
possible
i
wrapped
myself
up
in
my
sheepskin
which
i
had
dried
by
the
fire
during
the
day
and
i
laid
down
beside
the
fire
my
head
on
a
flat
stone
which
served
for
a
pillow
you
go
to
sleep
said
vitalis
i
wake
you
when
it
my
turn
for
although
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
animals
or
people
in
this
cabin
one
of
us
must
keep
awake
to
see
that
the
fire
does
not
go
out
we
must
be
careful
not
to
get
cold
for
it
will
be
bitter
when
the
snow
stops
i
slept
in
the
small
hours
of
the
night
my
master
woke
me
the
fire
was
still
burning
and
the
snow
had
stopped
falling
it
my
turn
to
sleep
now
said
vitalis
as
the
fire
goes
down
you
throw
on
this
wood
that
i
got
already
here
he
had
piled
up
a
heap
of
small
wood
by
the
grate
my
master
who
slept
much
lighter
than
i
did
not
wish
me
to
wake
him
by
pulling
down
the
wood
from
the
walls
each
time
i
needed
it
so
from
this
heap
that
he
had
prepared
i
could
take
the
wood
and
throw
on
the
fire
without
making
a
noise
it
was
a
wise
thing
to
do
but
alas
vitalis
did
not
know
what
the
result
would
be
he
stretched
out
now
before
the
fire
with
in
his
coverlet
cuddled
up
against
him
and
soon
from
his
deep
breathing
i
knew
that
he
had
fallen
asleep
then
i
got
up
softly
and
went
to
the
opening
to
see
how
it
looked
outside
all
the
grass
the
bushes
and
the
trees
were
buried
in
snow
everywhere
the
eye
rested
was
a
dazzling
white
the
sky
was
dotted
with
twinkling
stars
but
although
they
were
so
bright
it
was
the
snow
which
shed
the
pale
light
over
the
earth
it
was
much
colder
now
it
was
freezing
hard
oh
what
should
we
have
done
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
in
the
snow
and
the
cold
if
we
had
not
found
this
shelter
although
i
had
walked
on
tiptoe
to
the
opening
without
scarcely
making
a
sound
i
had
roused
the
dogs
and
zerbino
had
followed
me
the
splendor
of
the
night
was
nothing
to
him
he
looked
on
the
scene
for
a
moment
and
then
became
bored
and
wanted
to
go
outside
i
ordered
him
to
return
to
his
place
foolish
dog
was
it
better
to
stay
by
the
warm
fire
in
this
terrible
cold
than
to
go
prowling
around
he
obeyed
me
but
with
a
very
bad
grace
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
entrance
i
stayed
there
for
a
few
minutes
longer
looking
at
the
white
night
it
was
beautiful
but
although
i
enjoyed
it
somehow
i
felt
a
vague
sadness
i
could
have
gone
inside
and
not
looked
of
course
but
the
white
mysterious
scene
held
me
fascinated
at
last
i
went
back
to
the
fire
and
having
placed
two
or
three
long
pieces
of
wood
crossways
upon
one
another
i
sat
down
on
the
stone
which
had
served
me
for
a
pillow
my
master
was
sleeping
calmly
the
dogs
and
also
slept
and
the
flames
leaped
from
the
fire
and
swirled
upward
to
the
roof
throwing
out
bright
sparks
the
spluttering
flame
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
for
a
long
time
i
watched
the
sparks
then
little
by
little
i
began
to
get
drowsy
without
my
being
aware
if
i
had
been
compelled
to
busy
myself
with
getting
the
wood
i
could
have
kept
awake
but
seated
before
the
fire
with
nothing
to
do
i
became
so
sleepy
and
yet
all
the
time
i
thought
that
i
could
manage
to
keep
awake
i
sprang
up
suddenly
awakened
by
a
violent
barking
it
was
night
i
probably
had
slept
for
a
long
time
and
the
fire
was
almost
out
no
flames
lit
the
hut
now
capi
was
barking
loudly
furiously
but
strange
there
was
no
sound
from
zerbino
or
dulcie
what
the
matter
cried
vitalis
waking
up
i
do
know
you
been
to
sleep
and
the
fire
gone
out
capi
had
run
to
the
opening
but
had
not
ventured
outside
he
stood
on
the
threshold
barking
what
has
happened
i
asked
in
my
turn
in
answer
to
capi
barks
came
two
or
three
mournful
howls
i
recognized
dulcie
voice
these
howls
came
from
behind
our
hut
and
at
a
very
short
distance
i
was
going
out
but
vitalis
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
stopped
me
first
he
said
in
a
tone
of
command
put
some
wood
on
the
fire
while
i
obeyed
he
took
a
sprig
from
the
fire
and
blew
it
out
until
only
the
point
remained
burning
he
held
the
torch
in
his
hand
come
and
see
what
is
the
matter
he
said
you
walk
behind
me
go
ahead
capi
as
we
went
out
there
was
a
frightful
howl
capi
drew
back
cowering
behind
us
in
terror
wolves
where
are
zerbino
and
dulcie
what
could
i
say
the
two
dogs
must
have
gone
out
while
i
slept
zerbino
had
waited
until
i
was
asleep
and
had
then
crept
out
and
dulcie
had
followed
him
the
wolves
had
got
hold
of
them
there
was
fear
in
my
master
voice
when
he
asked
for
the
dogs
take
a
torch
he
said
we
must
go
to
their
aid
in
our
village
i
had
heard
them
tell
terrible
stories
of
wolves
yet
i
could
not
hesitate
i
ran
back
for
a
torch
then
followed
my
master
but
outside
we
could
see
neither
dogs
nor
wolves
on
the
snow
we
could
see
only
the
imprint
of
the
two
dogs
paws
we
followed
these
traces
around
the
hut
then
at
a
certain
distance
we
could
see
a
space
in
the
snow
which
looked
as
though
some
animals
had
been
rolling
in
it
go
and
look
for
them
capi
said
my
master
at
the
same
time
he
whistled
to
attract
zerbino
and
dulcie
but
there
was
no
barking
in
reply
no
sound
disturbed
the
mournful
silence
of
the
forest
and
capi
instead
of
running
off
as
he
was
told
kept
close
to
us
giving
every
sign
of
fear
capi
who
was
usually
so
obedient
and
brave
there
was
not
sufficient
light
for
us
to
follow
the
imprints
any
distance
the
snow
around
us
was
dazzling
but
beyond
seemed
all
vague
and
obscure
again
vitalis
whistled
and
shouted
for
the
missing
dogs
there
was
no
answering
bark
oh
poor
zerbino
poor
dulcie
the
wolves
have
got
them
said
vitalis
why
did
you
let
them
go
out
yes
why
i
had
nothing
to
say
we
must
go
and
look
for
them
i
said
after
a
pause
i
went
before
him
but
he
stopped
me
where
will
you
look
for
them
he
asked
i
do
know
everywhere
we
ca
tell
in
this
dim
light
where
they
have
gone
that
was
true
and
the
snow
came
up
above
our
knees
our
two
torches
together
could
not
penetrate
the
shadows
if
they
do
not
reply
it
is
because
they
are
a
long
way
off
he
said
we
must
not
go
on
the
wolves
might
attack
us
also
we
can
not
defend
ourselves
it
was
dreadful
to
have
to
leave
the
poor
dogs
to
their
fate
our
two
friends
friends
particularly
to
me
and
the
terrible
part
of
it
was
that
i
knew
that
i
was
responsible
if
i
had
not
slept
they
would
not
have
gone
out
my
master
had
turned
back
to
the
hut
i
followed
looking
back
at
each
step
stopping
to
listen
i
heard
nothing
and
saw
nothing
but
the
snow
when
we
reached
the
hut
another
surprise
awaited
us
the
branches
that
i
had
thrown
on
the
fire
were
aflame
and
lit
up
the
darkest
corners
of
the
cabin
but
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
his
coverlets
were
there
before
the
fire
but
he
was
not
in
them
i
called
vitalis
called
but
he
did
not
appear
my
master
said
that
when
he
awoke
the
monkey
was
beside
him
so
it
was
while
we
were
out
that
he
had
disappeared
with
our
burning
torches
held
down
to
the
snowy
earth
we
started
out
to
look
for
him
we
found
no
trace
of
him
we
returned
to
the
hut
to
see
if
he
were
hidden
behind
some
faggots
we
searched
for
a
long
time
ten
times
we
looked
in
the
same
place
the
same
corners
i
climbed
up
on
vitalis
shoulders
to
look
amongst
the
branches
of
which
the
roof
was
made
we
called
again
and
again
but
there
was
no
answer
vitalis
seemed
angry
i
was
in
despair
i
asked
my
master
if
he
thought
that
the
wolves
could
have
taken
him
also
no
he
said
the
wolves
would
not
dare
come
into
the
hut
i
am
afraid
they
got
zerbino
and
dulcie
when
they
went
out
but
they
did
not
come
in
here
it
is
quite
likely
that
was
terrified
and
has
hidden
himself
somewhere
while
we
were
outside
that
is
why
i
am
so
anxious
in
this
terrible
weather
he
will
catch
cold
and
cold
is
fatal
for
him
well
let
us
keep
on
looking
we
went
over
the
ground
again
but
all
in
vain
we
must
wait
till
day
said
vitalis
when
will
it
be
day
in
two
or
three
hours
i
think
vitalis
sat
down
before
the
fire
with
his
head
in
his
hands
i
did
not
dare
disturb
him
i
stood
quite
close
to
him
only
moving
occasionally
to
put
some
branches
on
the
fire
once
or
twice
he
got
up
and
went
to
the
door
he
looked
at
the
sky
listened
attentively
then
came
back
and
sat
down
i
would
rather
that
he
had
been
angry
with
me
than
that
he
should
be
so
silent
and
sad
the
three
hours
passed
slowly
it
seemed
that
the
night
would
never
end
the
stars
were
fading
from
the
heavens
the
sky
was
getting
lighter
day
was
breaking
but
as
morning
came
the
cold
grew
more
intense
the
air
which
came
through
the
door
froze
us
to
the
bone
if
we
did
find
would
he
be
alive
the
snow
had
quite
stopped
falling
now
and
there
was
a
pinkish
light
in
the
sky
which
foretold
fine
weather
as
soon
as
it
was
quite
light
vitalis
and
i
armed
with
a
stout
stick
left
the
hut
capi
did
not
appear
so
terrified
as
he
had
been
the
night
before
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
master
he
only
waited
for
a
sign
from
him
to
rush
forward
as
we
were
examining
the
ground
for
footprints
capi
threw
back
his
head
and
began
to
bark
joyfully
he
signified
that
we
must
look
up
not
on
the
ground
in
the
great
oak
standing
by
the
hut
we
found
him
poor
frightened
by
the
howling
of
the
dogs
he
had
jumped
onto
the
roof
of
the
cabin
when
we
had
gone
out
and
from
there
he
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
an
oak
where
feeling
that
he
was
in
a
safe
place
he
had
remained
crouching
without
replying
to
our
calls
the
poor
little
frail
creature
he
must
be
frozen
my
master
called
him
gently
he
did
not
move
we
thought
that
he
was
already
dead
for
several
minutes
vitalis
continued
to
call
him
but
the
monkey
gave
no
sign
of
life
my
heart
ached
with
remorse
how
severely
i
was
being
punished
i
must
atone
i
go
up
and
get
him
i
said
you
break
your
neck
no
there
is
no
danger
i
can
do
it
easily
that
was
not
true
there
was
danger
it
was
very
difficult
for
the
large
tree
was
covered
with
ice
and
snow
when
i
was
quite
small
i
had
learned
to
climb
trees
and
i
was
quite
an
adept
in
this
art
i
jumped
and
caught
hold
of
the
lowest
branches
i
held
onto
these
and
although
blinded
by
the
snow
that
fell
in
my
eyes
i
managed
to
climb
up
the
trunk
to
the
stronger
branches
once
up
there
i
had
only
to
be
careful
not
to
lose
my
footing
as
i
climbed
i
spoke
softly
to
he
did
not
move
but
looked
at
me
with
shining
eyes
i
had
almost
reached
him
and
was
about
to
stretch
out
my
hand
when
with
a
spring
he
had
jumped
to
another
branch
i
followed
him
to
this
branch
but
men
alas
and
even
youngsters
are
very
inferior
to
monkeys
when
it
comes
to
climbing
trees
it
is
quite
possible
that
i
should
never
have
caught
him
if
the
snow
had
not
wet
his
feet
he
did
not
like
this
and
soon
got
tired
of
dodging
me
then
letting
himself
drop
from
branch
to
branch
he
jumped
straight
onto
his
master
shoulders
and
hid
himself
inside
his
coat
it
was
a
great
thing
to
have
found
but
that
was
not
all
now
we
had
to
look
for
the
dogs
it
was
day
now
and
easy
for
us
to
see
what
had
happened
in
the
snow
we
read
the
death
of
our
dogs
we
followed
their
footprints
for
thirty
yards
they
had
come
out
of
the
hut
one
behind
the
other
dulcie
following
zerbino
then
we
saw
other
footprints
on
one
side
there
were
signs
of
a
struggle
where
the
wolves
had
sprung
upon
the
dogs
and
on
the
other
sides
were
the
footprints
of
the
wolves
where
they
trotted
off
carrying
their
prey
with
them
to
be
devoured
at
their
leisure
there
was
no
trace
of
the
dogs
except
a
red
trail
of
blood
which
here
and
there
stained
the
snow
the
two
poor
dogs
had
gone
to
their
death
while
i
slept
we
had
to
get
busy
as
quickly
as
possible
with
warming
we
hurried
back
to
the
hut
while
vitalis
held
out
the
little
feet
and
hands
to
the
fire
as
one
holds
a
tiny
baby
i
warmed
his
coverlets
and
we
rolled
him
up
in
them
but
he
needed
more
than
the
coverlets
he
needed
a
warm
drink
my
master
and
i
sat
by
the
fire
silent
watching
the
wood
burn
poor
zerbino
poor
dulcie
each
of
us
murmured
these
words
first
he
then
i
the
dogs
had
been
our
friends
our
companions
in
good
and
bad
fortune
and
to
me
in
my
loneliness
they
had
meant
so
much
how
deeply
i
reproached
myself
for
not
having
kept
watch
the
wolves
would
not
have
come
to
attack
us
in
our
cabin
they
would
have
stayed
in
the
distance
frightened
by
the
fire
if
only
vitalis
would
have
scolded
me
i
wished
that
he
would
beat
me
but
he
said
nothing
he
did
not
even
look
at
me
he
sat
with
his
head
bent
over
the
fire
probably
wondering
what
would
become
of
us
without
the
dogs
chapter
xiv
the
death
of
the
sun
came
out
brightly
its
rays
fell
on
the
white
snow
and
the
forest
which
the
night
before
had
looked
so
bleak
and
livid
was
now
dazzling
with
a
radiancy
that
blinded
the
eyes
several
times
vitalis
passed
his
hand
under
the
coverlet
to
feel
but
the
poor
little
monkey
did
not
get
warmer
and
when
i
bent
over
him
i
could
hear
him
shivering
and
shaking
the
blood
in
his
veins
was
frozen
we
must
get
to
a
village
or
will
die
said
vitalis
let
us
start
at
once
his
wrappings
were
well
heated
and
the
little
creature
was
rolled
in
them
my
master
placed
him
under
his
vest
next
his
heart
we
were
ready
this
was
a
shelter
said
vitalis
looking
round
the
hut
as
we
were
going
out
that
has
made
us
pay
dearly
for
its
hospitality
his
voice
trembled
he
went
out
first
and
i
followed
in
his
footsteps
when
we
had
gone
a
few
yards
we
had
to
call
to
capi
poor
dog
he
had
remained
standing
outside
the
hut
his
nose
turned
to
the
spot
where
his
companions
had
been
taken
by
the
wolves
ten
minutes
later
we
reached
the
main
road
we
passed
a
cart
the
driver
told
us
that
within
an
hour
we
should
reach
a
village
this
was
encouraging
yet
it
was
difficult
even
painful
to
walk
the
snow
came
up
to
my
waist
many
times
i
asked
vitalis
after
each
time
he
told
me
that
he
was
still
shivering
at
last
we
saw
the
white
roofs
of
a
fair
sized
village
we
were
not
in
the
habit
of
putting
up
at
the
better
class
inns
we
always
chose
a
poor
place
where
we
were
sure
we
should
not
be
driven
away
and
where
they
would
not
take
all
we
had
but
this
time
vitalis
went
into
an
inn
where
a
beautiful
sign
hung
outside
the
kitchen
door
the
door
was
open
and
we
could
see
the
great
stove
covered
with
shining
copper
saucepans
from
which
the
steam
was
rising
ah
how
good
that
soup
smelled
to
the
famished
wanderers
my
master
putting
on
his
most
gentlemanly
airs
and
with
his
hat
on
his
head
and
his
head
thrown
back
asked
the
landlady
for
a
good
bed
and
a
fire
at
first
the
landlady
who
was
a
fine
looking
woman
had
not
condescended
to
notice
us
but
vitalis
grand
manner
evidently
impressed
her
she
spoke
to
a
maid
and
told
her
to
take
us
up
to
a
room
quick
get
into
bed
said
vitalis
while
the
servant
was
lighting
the
fire
i
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
why
go
to
bed
i
would
rather
sit
down
and
eat
something
than
go
to
bed
quick
hurry
up
repeated
vitalis
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
obey
there
was
an
eiderdown
quilt
on
the
bed
vitalis
pulled
it
right
up
to
my
chin
try
and
get
warm
he
said
the
warmer
you
are
the
better
it
seemed
to
me
that
needed
warming
much
more
than
i
because
i
was
not
very
cold
now
while
i
laid
still
under
the
eiderdown
trying
to
get
warm
vitalis
to
the
servant
astonishment
turned
little
round
and
round
before
the
fire
as
though
he
were
going
to
roast
him
are
you
warm
vitalis
asked
me
after
a
few
minutes
i
suffocating
that
right
he
came
to
the
bed
quickly
he
put
in
telling
me
to
hold
him
close
to
my
chest
the
poor
little
animal
who
always
rebelled
when
he
was
made
to
do
something
that
he
did
not
want
seemed
resigned
to
everything
he
let
me
hold
him
close
to
my
body
without
making
a
movement
but
he
was
not
cold
now
his
body
was
burning
my
master
who
had
gone
down
to
the
kitchen
soon
returned
carrying
a
bowl
of
well
sweetened
wine
he
tried
to
make
drink
a
few
spoonfuls
but
the
poor
little
creature
could
not
unclench
his
teeth
with
his
brilliant
eyes
he
looked
at
us
imploringly
as
though
to
ask
us
not
to
torment
him
then
he
drew
one
arm
from
under
the
covers
and
held
it
out
to
us
i
wondered
what
he
meant
i
looked
inquiringly
at
vitalis
who
explained
before
i
had
met
them
had
had
inflammation
of
the
lungs
and
they
had
had
to
bleed
him
taking
the
blood
from
his
arm
knowing
that
he
was
sick
now
he
wanted
us
to
bleed
him
so
that
he
could
get
better
as
before
poor
little
monkey
vitalis
was
touched
to
the
heart
and
this
made
him
still
more
anxious
it
was
evident
that
was
ill
and
he
must
be
very
ill
indeed
to
refuse
the
sugared
wine
that
he
liked
so
much
drink
the
wine
remi
and
stay
in
bed
said
vitalis
i
go
for
a
doctor
i
must
admit
that
i
also
liked
sugared
wine
and
besides
i
was
very
hungry
i
did
not
let
him
tell
me
twice
to
drink
it
after
i
had
emptied
the
bowl
i
slid
down
under
the
eiderdown
again
where
the
heat
aided
by
the
wine
nearly
suffocated
me
vitalis
was
not
gone
long
he
soon
returned
bringing
with
him
a
gentleman
wearing
spectacles
the
doctor
thinking
that
the
doctor
might
not
put
himself
out
for
a
monkey
vitalis
had
not
told
him
who
was
his
patient
when
he
saw
me
in
bed
as
red
as
a
tomato
the
doctor
put
his
hand
on
my
forehead
and
said
at
once
congestion
he
shook
his
head
with
an
air
which
augured
nothing
good
anxious
to
undeceive
him
for
fear
he
might
bleed
me
i
cried
why
not
ill
not
ill
why
the
child
is
delirious
i
lifted
the
quilt
a
bit
and
showed
him
who
had
placed
his
little
arm
round
my
neck
he
the
one
that
ill
i
said
a
monkey
he
exclaimed
turning
angrily
to
vitalis
you
brought
me
out
in
such
weather
to
see
a
monkey
our
master
was
a
smart
man
who
was
not
easily
ruffled
politely
and
with
his
grand
air
he
stopped
the
doctor
then
he
explained
the
situation
how
he
had
been
caught
in
a
snowstorm
and
how
through
fear
of
the
wolves
had
jumped
up
in
an
oak
tree
where
he
had
been
almost
frozen
to
death
the
patient
might
be
only
a
monkey
but
what
a
genius
and
what
a
friend
and
companion
to
us
how
could
we
confide
such
a
wonderful
talented
creature
to
the
care
of
a
simple
veterinary
surgeon
every
one
knew
that
the
village
veterinary
was
an
ass
while
every
one
knew
that
doctors
were
scientific
men
even
in
the
smallest
village
if
one
rings
at
a
door
which
bears
a
doctor
name
one
is
sure
to
find
a
man
of
knowledge
and
of
generosity
although
the
monkey
is
only
an
animal
according
to
naturalists
they
are
so
near
like
men
that
often
an
illness
is
treated
the
same
for
one
as
for
the
other
and
was
it
not
interesting
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
to
study
how
these
illnesses
differed
the
doctor
soon
returned
from
the
door
where
he
had
been
standing
who
had
probably
guessed
that
this
person
wearing
the
spectacles
was
a
physician
again
pushed
out
his
arm
look
cried
vitalis
he
wants
you
to
bleed
him
that
settled
the
doctor
most
interesting
a
very
interesting
case
he
murmured
alas
after
examining
him
the
doctor
told
us
that
poor
little
again
had
inflammation
of
the
lungs
the
doctor
took
his
arm
and
thrust
a
lancet
into
a
vein
without
him
making
the
slightest
moan
knew
that
this
ought
to
cure
him
after
the
bleeding
he
required
a
good
deal
of
attention
i
of
course
had
not
stayed
in
bed
i
was
the
nurse
carrying
out
instructions
poor
little
he
liked
me
to
nurse
him
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
sadly
his
look
was
quite
human
he
who
was
usually
so
quick
and
petulant
always
playing
tricks
on
one
of
us
was
now
quiet
and
obedient
in
the
days
that
followed
he
tried
to
show
us
how
friendly
he
felt
towards
us
even
to
capi
who
had
so
often
been
the
victim
of
his
tricks
as
in
the
usual
trend
of
inflammation
of
the
lungs
he
soon
began
to
cough
the
attacks
tired
him
greatly
for
his
little
body
shook
convulsively
all
the
money
which
i
had
five
sous
i
spent
on
sugar
sticks
for
him
but
they
made
him
worse
instead
of
better
with
his
keen
instinct
he
soon
noticed
that
every
time
he
coughed
i
gave
him
a
little
piece
of
sugar
stick
he
took
advantage
of
this
and
coughed
every
moment
in
order
to
get
the
remedy
that
he
liked
so
much
and
this
remedy
instead
of
curing
him
made
him
worse
when
i
found
out
this
trick
i
naturally
stopped
giving
him
the
candy
but
he
was
not
discouraged
first
he
begged
for
it
with
an
appealing
look
then
when
he
saw
that
i
would
not
give
it
to
him
he
sat
up
in
his
seat
and
bent
his
little
body
with
his
hand
on
his
stomach
and
coughed
with
all
his
might
the
veins
in
his
forehead
stood
out
the
tears
ran
from
his
eyes
and
his
pretense
at
choking
in
the
end
turned
to
a
dreadful
attack
over
which
he
had
no
control
i
had
to
stay
at
the
inn
with
while
my
master
went
out
alone
one
morning
upon
his
return
he
told
me
that
the
landlady
had
demanded
the
sum
that
we
owed
her
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
ever
spoken
to
me
about
money
it
was
quite
by
chance
that
i
had
learned
that
he
had
sold
his
watch
to
buy
my
sheepskin
now
he
told
me
that
he
had
only
fifty
sous
left
the
only
thing
to
do
he
said
was
to
give
a
performance
that
same
day
a
performance
without
zerbino
dulcie
or
why
that
seemed
to
me
impossible
we
must
get
forty
francs
at
once
he
said
must
be
looked
after
we
must
have
a
fire
in
the
room
and
medicine
and
the
landlady
must
be
paid
if
we
pay
her
what
we
owe
her
she
will
give
us
another
credit
forty
francs
in
this
village
in
the
cold
and
with
such
poor
resources
at
our
command
while
i
stayed
at
home
with
vitalis
found
a
hall
in
the
public
market
for
an
performance
was
out
of
the
question
he
wrote
the
announcements
and
stuck
them
up
all
over
the
village
with
a
few
planks
of
wood
he
arranged
a
stage
and
bravely
spent
his
last
fifty
sous
to
buy
some
candles
which
he
cut
in
half
so
as
to
double
the
lights
from
the
window
of
our
room
i
saw
him
come
and
go
tramping
back
and
forth
in
the
snow
i
wondered
anxiously
what
program
he
could
make
i
was
soon
enlightened
on
this
subject
for
along
came
the
town
crier
of
the
village
wearing
a
scarlet
cap
and
stopped
before
the
inn
after
a
magnificent
roll
of
his
drum
he
read
out
our
program
vitalis
had
made
the
most
extravagant
promises
there
was
to
be
present
a
artist
that
was
capi
and
a
young
singer
who
was
a
marvel
the
marvel
was
myself
but
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
farce
was
that
there
was
no
fixed
price
for
the
entertainment
we
relied
upon
the
generosity
of
the
audience
and
the
public
need
not
pay
until
after
it
had
seen
heard
and
applauded
that
seemed
to
me
extraordinarily
bold
who
was
going
to
applaud
us
capi
certainly
deserved
to
be
celebrated
but
i
i
was
not
at
all
convinced
that
i
was
a
marvel
although
was
very
ill
at
this
moment
when
he
heard
the
drum
he
tried
to
get
up
from
the
noise
and
capi
barks
he
seemed
to
guess
that
it
was
to
announce
our
performance
i
had
to
force
him
back
on
his
bed
then
he
made
signs
to
me
to
give
him
his
general
uniform
the
red
coat
and
trousers
with
gold
braid
and
hat
with
the
plume
he
clasped
his
hands
and
went
down
on
his
knees
to
beg
me
when
he
saw
that
he
could
get
nothing
from
me
by
begging
he
tried
what
anger
would
do
then
finally
melted
into
tears
it
was
evident
that
we
should
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
convince
him
that
he
must
give
up
all
idea
of
playing
that
night
i
thought
it
would
be
better
not
to
let
him
know
when
we
started
when
vitalis
returned
he
told
me
to
get
my
harp
ready
and
all
the
things
we
required
for
the
entertainment
who
knew
what
this
meant
turned
to
his
master
and
commenced
his
entreaties
again
he
could
not
have
better
expressed
his
desires
than
by
the
sounds
he
uttered
the
twisting
of
his
face
and
the
turns
of
his
body
there
were
real
tears
on
his
cheeks
and
they
were
real
kisses
that
he
imprinted
on
vitalis
hand
you
want
to
play
asked
vitalis
who
had
not
been
told
what
happened
before
yes
oh
yes
whole
person
seemed
to
cry
out
he
tried
to
jump
to
show
that
he
was
no
longer
sick
we
know
very
well
that
if
we
took
him
out
it
would
be
his
death
it
was
time
for
us
to
start
before
going
i
made
up
a
good
fire
and
wrapped
up
in
his
coverlets
he
cried
again
and
embraced
me
as
much
as
he
could
then
we
started
as
we
tramped
through
the
snow
my
master
told
me
what
he
expected
of
me
we
could
not
of
course
give
our
usual
repertoire
as
our
principal
actors
were
missing
but
capi
and
i
could
vie
with
each
other
in
doing
our
best
we
had
to
collect
forty
francs
forty
francs
it
was
terrible
impossible
vitalis
had
prepared
everything
all
we
had
to
do
now
was
to
light
the
candles
but
this
was
an
extravagance
that
we
could
not
indulge
in
until
the
room
was
filled
for
our
illuminations
would
not
have
to
come
to
an
end
before
our
entertainment
whilst
we
took
possession
of
our
theater
the
town
crier
with
his
drum
came
through
the
village
streets
for
the
last
time
after
i
had
dressed
capi
and
myself
i
went
outside
and
stood
behind
a
pillar
to
watch
the
people
arrive
the
roll
of
the
drum
became
louder
it
was
approaching
the
market
place
and
i
could
hear
a
babble
of
voices
behind
the
drum
came
a
score
of
youngsters
all
keeping
step
without
stopping
the
beating
of
his
drum
the
town
crier
took
up
his
place
between
the
two
large
lamps
that
were
lit
at
the
entrance
of
our
theater
the
public
had
only
to
walk
in
and
take
their
seats
for
the
performance
to
commence
alas
how
long
they
were
coming
and
yet
the
drum
at
the
door
continued
gayly
its
ta
ta
all
the
boys
in
the
village
must
have
been
there
but
it
was
not
the
youngsters
who
were
likely
to
give
us
forty
francs
there
would
have
to
be
some
important
people
and
generous
at
last
vitalis
decided
that
we
ought
to
commence
although
the
hall
was
far
from
being
full
but
we
could
not
wait
longer
worried
as
we
were
by
the
terrible
question
of
candles
i
had
to
appear
first
and
sing
a
few
songs
accompanying
myself
on
the
harp
i
must
confess
the
applause
that
i
received
was
very
weak
i
had
never
thought
very
much
of
myself
as
an
entertainer
but
the
marked
coolness
with
which
the
audience
received
my
efforts
discouraged
me
if
i
did
not
please
them
they
would
certainly
not
give
us
anything
it
was
not
for
the
glory
that
i
was
singing
it
was
for
poor
ah
how
i
wanted
to
stir
this
public
to
make
them
enthusiastic
but
i
could
see
only
too
well
that
they
did
not
consider
me
a
marvel
capi
was
more
successful
he
received
several
encores
thanks
to
capi
the
entertainment
ended
in
a
burst
of
applause
not
only
did
they
clap
their
hands
but
they
stamped
their
feet
the
decisive
moment
had
arrived
while
capi
with
the
cup
in
his
jaws
ran
through
the
audience
i
danced
a
spanish
dance
on
the
stage
with
vitalis
playing
an
accompaniment
would
capi
collect
forty
francs
that
was
the
question
which
made
my
heart
beat
while
i
smiled
at
the
public
in
my
pleasantest
manner
i
was
out
of
breath
but
i
still
continued
to
dance
for
i
was
not
to
stop
until
capi
had
returned
he
did
not
hurry
himself
when
he
found
that
he
did
not
receive
a
coin
he
placed
his
paw
against
the
pocket
at
last
i
saw
him
about
to
return
and
thought
that
i
might
stop
but
vitalis
made
me
a
sign
to
go
on
i
continued
to
dance
and
going
a
few
steps
nearer
capi
i
saw
that
the
cup
was
not
full
far
from
it
vitalis
had
also
seen
this
bowing
to
the
audience
he
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
think
that
without
flattering
ourselves
we
have
conscientiously
carried
out
our
program
yet
as
our
candles
are
still
burning
i
will
if
the
public
wishes
sing
some
songs
myself
our
dog
capi
will
make
another
quest
and
those
who
have
not
yet
given
will
perhaps
give
this
time
please
have
your
money
ready
although
vitalis
had
been
my
teacher
i
had
never
really
heard
him
sing
or
at
least
not
as
he
sung
that
evening
he
selected
two
songs
an
air
from
joseph
and
one
from
richard
the
lion
hearted
although
i
was
only
a
little
boy
and
was
no
judge
as
to
whether
one
sang
with
technique
or
without
vitalis
singing
stirred
me
strangely
i
went
into
a
corner
of
the
stage
for
my
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
i
listened
to
his
beautiful
notes
through
a
mist
i
saw
a
young
lady
who
occupied
the
first
row
clap
her
hands
with
all
her
might
i
had
already
noticed
that
she
was
not
a
peasant
like
the
rest
of
the
people
in
the
hall
she
was
a
lady
young
and
beautiful
and
from
her
handsome
fur
coat
i
took
her
to
be
the
richest
woman
in
the
village
she
had
with
her
a
little
child
who
had
applauded
capi
heartily
it
was
probably
her
son
for
the
likeness
was
striking
after
the
first
song
capi
went
the
round
again
i
saw
with
surprise
that
the
lady
had
not
put
anything
into
his
cup
when
my
master
had
finished
the
air
from
the
second
opera
she
beckoned
me
to
her
i
want
to
speak
to
that
gentleman
she
said
i
was
surprised
i
thought
she
would
have
done
better
to
have
dropped
something
into
the
cup
capi
returned
he
had
collected
very
little
more
on
this
second
round
what
does
the
lady
want
asked
vitalis
to
speak
to
you
i
have
nothing
to
say
she
did
not
give
anything
to
capi
perhaps
she
would
like
to
give
it
now
then
it
is
for
capi
to
go
to
her
not
for
me
however
he
decided
to
go
and
took
the
dog
with
him
i
followed
them
by
now
a
servant
had
appeared
carrying
a
lantern
and
a
rug
he
stood
beside
the
lady
and
the
child
vitalis
bowed
coldly
to
her
forgive
me
for
having
disturbed
you
she
said
but
i
wanted
to
congratulate
you
vitalis
bowed
without
saying
a
word
i
am
a
musician
continued
the
lady
i
am
telling
you
this
so
that
you
will
know
how
much
i
appreciate
your
superb
talent
superb
talent
my
master
the
dog
trainer
i
was
amazed
an
old
man
like
me
has
no
talent
he
replied
coldly
do
not
think
that
i
am
inquisitive
but
began
the
lady
i
am
quite
willing
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
madam
he
said
you
are
surprised
that
a
dog
trainer
is
able
to
sing
a
little
but
i
have
not
always
been
what
i
am
now
when
i
was
younger
i
was
the
servant
of
a
great
singer
and
like
a
parrot
i
imitated
him
i
began
to
repeat
some
of
the
songs
he
practiced
in
my
presence
that
is
all
the
lady
did
not
reply
she
looked
hard
at
vitalis
he
seemed
embarrassed
sir
she
said
at
last
laying
a
stress
on
the
word
sir
and
once
more
let
me
thank
you
for
the
exquisite
delight
you
have
given
me
this
evening
and
leaning
towards
capi
she
dropped
a
gold
piece
in
his
cup
i
thought
that
vitalis
would
escort
her
to
the
door
but
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
and
when
she
was
out
of
hearing
i
heard
him
swear
softly
in
italian
she
gave
capi
a
louis
i
said
i
thought
he
was
going
to
give
me
a
blow
but
he
let
his
raised
hand
fall
to
his
side
a
louis
he
said
as
though
he
were
coming
out
of
a
dream
ah
yes
poor
i
had
forgotten
him
let
us
go
back
to
the
little
creature
at
once
i
climbed
the
stairs
of
the
inn
first
and
went
into
the
room
the
fire
was
not
out
but
there
were
no
flames
i
lit
a
candle
quickly
i
was
surprised
not
to
hear
any
sound
from
i
found
him
lying
under
his
coverlets
stretched
out
his
full
length
dressed
in
his
general
uniform
he
appeared
to
be
asleep
i
leaned
over
him
and
took
his
hand
gently
to
wake
him
up
his
hand
was
cold
vitalis
came
into
the
room
i
turned
to
him
is
cold
i
said
my
master
came
to
my
side
and
also
leaned
over
the
bed
he
is
dead
he
said
it
was
to
be
ah
remi
boy
i
did
wrong
to
take
you
away
from
milligan
i
am
punished
zerbino
dulcie
and
now
and
this
is
not
the
end
chapter
xv
faithful
friends
we
were
still
a
long
way
from
paris
we
had
to
go
by
roads
covered
with
snow
and
walk
from
morning
till
night
the
north
wind
blowing
in
our
faces
how
sad
and
weary
were
those
long
tramps
vitalis
walked
ahead
i
at
his
heels
and
capi
behind
me
thus
in
line
we
went
onward
without
exchanging
a
word
for
hours
and
hours
faces
blue
with
cold
feet
wet
stomachs
empty
the
people
who
passed
us
on
the
way
turned
round
to
gaze
at
us
evidently
they
thought
it
strange
where
was
this
old
man
leading
his
child
and
the
dog
the
silence
seemed
terrible
to
me
and
so
sad
i
would
liked
to
have
talked
just
for
company
but
when
i
did
venture
to
make
a
remark
vitalis
replied
briefly
without
even
turning
his
head
fortunately
capi
was
more
sociable
and
as
i
trudged
along
i
often
felt
his
warm
tongue
on
my
hand
he
licked
me
as
much
as
to
say
your
friend
capi
is
here
with
you
then
i
stroked
him
gently
without
stopping
we
understood
each
other
we
loved
each
other
on
the
slippery
snow
we
went
straight
ahead
without
stopping
sleeping
at
night
in
a
stable
or
in
a
sheepfold
with
a
piece
of
bread
alas
very
small
for
our
meal
in
the
evening
this
was
our
dinner
and
supper
in
one
we
did
not
tell
the
shepherds
that
we
were
dying
of
hunger
but
vitalis
with
his
usual
cleverness
would
say
insinuatingly
that
the
little
chap
was
very
fond
of
sheep
milk
because
when
he
was
a
baby
he
used
to
drink
it
this
story
did
not
always
take
effect
but
it
was
a
good
night
for
me
when
it
did
yes
i
was
very
fond
of
sheep
milk
and
when
they
gave
me
some
i
felt
much
stronger
the
next
day
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
as
we
neared
paris
the
country
ceased
to
be
beautiful
the
snow
was
not
white
and
dazzling
now
i
had
heard
what
a
wonderful
place
paris
was
and
i
expected
something
extraordinary
i
did
not
know
exactly
what
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
trees
of
gold
streets
of
marble
palaces
everywhere
what
were
we
poor
things
going
to
do
when
we
reached
paris
i
wanted
to
question
vitalis
but
i
did
not
dare
he
seemed
so
gloomy
when
we
were
in
sight
of
the
roofs
and
the
church
towers
of
the
capital
he
slackened
his
step
to
walk
beside
me
remi
he
said
suddenly
we
are
going
to
part
when
we
get
to
paris
i
looked
at
him
he
looked
at
me
the
sudden
pallor
of
my
face
and
the
trembling
of
my
lips
told
him
what
effect
his
words
had
on
me
for
a
moment
i
could
not
speak
going
to
part
i
murmured
at
last
poor
little
chap
yes
we
must
part
the
tone
in
which
he
said
this
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
it
was
so
long
since
i
had
heard
a
kind
word
oh
you
are
so
good
i
cried
it
is
you
who
are
good
you
brave
little
heart
there
comes
a
time
in
one
life
when
one
feels
these
things
when
all
goes
well
one
goes
along
through
life
without
thinking
much
who
is
with
one
but
when
things
go
wrong
when
one
is
on
the
wrong
track
and
above
all
when
one
is
old
one
wants
to
lean
on
somebody
you
may
be
surprised
that
i
have
wanted
to
lean
on
you
and
yet
it
is
so
but
only
to
see
that
your
eyes
are
moist
as
you
listen
to
me
comforts
me
little
remi
i
am
very
unhappy
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
i
just
stroked
his
hand
and
the
misfortune
is
that
we
have
to
part
just
at
the
time
when
we
are
getting
nearer
to
each
other
but
you
not
going
to
leave
me
all
alone
in
paris
i
asked
timidly
no
certainly
not
what
would
you
do
in
the
big
city
all
by
yourself
poor
child
i
have
no
right
to
leave
you
remember
that
the
day
when
i
would
not
let
that
good
lady
take
you
and
bring
you
up
as
her
son
that
day
i
bound
myself
to
do
the
best
i
could
for
you
i
can
do
nothing
at
this
moment
and
that
is
why
i
think
it
is
best
to
part
it
is
only
for
a
time
we
can
do
better
if
we
separate
during
the
last
months
of
the
bad
season
what
can
we
do
in
paris
with
all
gone
but
capi
hearing
his
name
mentioned
dear
capi
came
beside
us
he
put
his
paw
to
his
ear
in
military
salute
then
placed
it
on
his
heart
as
though
to
tell
us
that
we
could
count
on
his
devotion
my
master
stopped
to
pass
his
hand
affectionately
over
the
dog
head
yes
capi
you
a
good
faithful
friend
but
alas
without
the
others
we
ca
do
much
now
but
my
harp
if
i
had
two
children
like
you
it
would
be
better
but
an
old
man
with
just
one
little
boy
is
bad
business
i
am
not
old
enough
now
if
i
were
only
blind
or
broken
down
i
am
not
in
a
pitiful
state
enough
for
people
to
stop
and
notice
us
so
my
boy
i
have
decided
to
give
you
to
a
until
the
end
of
the
winter
he
will
take
you
with
other
children
that
he
has
and
you
will
play
your
harp
and
you
i
asked
i
am
known
in
paris
i
have
stayed
there
several
times
i
will
give
violin
lessons
to
the
italian
children
who
play
on
the
streets
i
have
only
to
say
that
i
will
give
lessons
to
find
all
the
pupils
i
want
and
in
the
meantime
i
will
train
two
dogs
that
will
replace
poor
zerbino
and
dulcie
then
in
the
spring
we
will
be
together
again
my
little
remi
we
are
only
passing
through
a
bad
time
now
later
i
will
take
you
through
germany
and
england
then
you
will
grow
big
and
your
mind
will
develop
i
will
teach
you
a
lot
of
things
and
make
a
man
of
you
i
promised
this
to
milligan
i
will
keep
my
promise
that
is
the
reason
why
i
have
already
commenced
to
teach
you
english
you
can
speak
french
and
italian
that
is
something
for
a
child
of
your
age
perhaps
it
was
all
for
the
best
as
my
master
said
but
i
could
only
think
of
two
things
we
were
to
be
parted
and
i
was
to
have
a
during
our
wanderings
i
had
met
several
who
used
to
beat
the
children
who
worked
for
them
they
were
very
cruel
and
they
swore
and
usually
they
were
drunk
would
i
belong
to
one
of
those
terrible
men
and
then
even
if
fate
gave
me
a
kind
master
it
was
another
change
first
my
foster
mother
then
vitalis
then
another
was
it
to
be
always
so
should
i
never
find
anyone
that
i
could
love
and
stay
with
always
little
by
little
i
had
grown
attached
to
vitalis
he
seemed
almost
what
i
thought
a
father
would
be
should
i
never
have
a
father
have
a
family
always
alone
in
this
great
world
nobody
boy
vitalis
had
asked
me
to
be
brave
i
did
not
wish
to
add
to
his
sorrows
but
it
was
hard
so
hard
to
leave
him
as
we
walked
down
a
dirty
street
with
heaps
of
snow
on
either
side
covered
with
cinders
and
rotten
vegetables
i
asked
where
are
we
in
paris
my
boy
where
were
my
marble
houses
and
the
trees
of
gold
and
the
finely
dressed
people
was
this
paris
was
i
to
spend
the
winter
in
a
place
like
this
parted
from
vitalis
and
capi
chapter
xvi
the
padrone
although
i
knew
later
how
beautiful
was
the
city
of
paris
the
slums
being
my
first
glimpse
created
anything
but
a
favorable
impression
vitalis
who
seemed
to
know
his
way
pushed
through
the
groups
of
people
who
obstructed
his
passage
along
the
narrow
street
we
had
just
turned
down
mind
you
do
lose
me
cautioned
vitalis
but
his
warning
was
not
necessary
for
i
trod
upon
his
heels
and
to
be
more
sure
of
him
i
held
a
corner
of
his
coat
in
my
hand
we
crossed
a
big
courtyard
to
a
dirty
dismal
house
where
surely
the
sun
had
never
penetrated
it
was
the
worst
looking
place
i
had
seen
so
far
is
garofoli
in
asked
vitalis
of
a
man
who
by
the
light
from
a
lantern
was
hanging
rags
against
the
door
i
do
know
go
up
and
see
for
yourself
he
growled
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
it
faces
you
garofoli
is
the
remi
i
told
you
about
said
vitalis
this
is
where
he
lives
the
street
the
house
the
staircase
was
not
in
the
nature
to
reassure
me
what
would
this
new
master
be
like
without
knocking
vitalis
pushed
open
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
on
the
top
floor
and
we
found
ourselves
in
a
large
attic
there
was
a
great
empty
space
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
all
around
the
walls
were
beds
a
dozen
in
all
the
walls
and
ceiling
that
had
once
been
white
were
now
filthy
with
smoke
dust
and
dirt
on
the
walls
was
a
drawing
of
a
head
in
charcoal
and
some
flowers
and
birds
are
you
there
garofoli
asked
vitalis
it
is
so
dark
i
ca
see
any
one
it
vitalis
a
weak
drawling
voice
replied
to
vitalis
question
signor
garofoli
has
gone
out
he
will
not
be
back
for
two
hours
a
boy
about
twelve
years
of
age
came
forward
i
was
struck
by
his
strange
looks
even
now
as
i
write
i
can
see
him
as
i
saw
him
then
he
had
no
body
so
to
speak
for
he
seemed
all
legs
and
head
his
great
head
was
out
of
all
proportion
built
so
he
could
not
have
been
called
handsome
yet
there
was
something
in
his
face
which
attracted
one
strangely
an
expression
of
sadness
and
gentleness
and
yes
hopelessness
his
large
eyes
held
your
own
with
sympathy
you
are
sure
he
will
not
be
back
for
two
hours
asked
vitalis
quite
sure
signor
that
will
be
dinner
time
and
no
one
ever
serves
dinner
but
signor
garofoli
well
if
he
comes
in
before
tell
him
that
vitalis
will
be
back
in
two
hours
very
well
signor
i
was
about
to
follow
vitalis
when
he
stopped
me
stay
here
he
said
you
can
rest
oh
i
come
back
he
added
reassuringly
noticing
my
look
of
anxiety
are
you
italian
asked
the
boy
when
vitalis
heavy
step
could
no
longer
be
heard
on
the
stairs
no
i
replied
in
french
i
french
that
a
good
thing
what
you
like
the
french
better
than
the
italians
oh
no
i
was
thinking
of
you
when
i
said
a
good
thing
because
if
you
were
italian
you
would
probably
come
here
to
work
for
signor
garofoli
and
i
be
sorry
for
you
is
he
wicked
then
the
boy
did
not
reply
but
the
look
he
gave
me
spoke
more
than
words
as
though
he
did
not
wish
to
continue
the
conversation
he
went
over
to
the
fireplace
on
a
shelf
in
the
fireplace
was
an
immense
earthenware
saucepan
i
drew
nearer
to
the
fire
to
warm
myself
and
i
noticed
that
the
pot
had
something
peculiar
about
it
the
lid
through
which
a
straight
tube
projected
to
allow
the
steam
to
escape
was
fixed
on
the
saucepan
on
one
side
with
a
hinge
and
on
the
other
with
a
padlock
why
is
that
closed
with
a
padlock
i
asked
inquisitively
so
that
i
sha
take
any
of
the
soup
i
have
to
look
after
it
but
the
boss
does
trust
me
i
could
not
help
smiling
you
laugh
he
said
sadly
because
you
think
that
i
a
glutton
perhaps
if
you
were
in
my
place
you
do
the
same
as
i
done
not
a
pig
but
i
famished
and
the
smell
of
the
soup
as
it
comes
out
through
the
spout
makes
me
still
hungrier
does
signor
garofoli
give
you
enough
to
eat
he
starves
us
oh
i
tell
you
what
i
have
done
went
on
the
boy
if
he
going
to
be
your
master
it
will
be
a
lesson
for
you
my
name
is
mattia
garofoli
is
my
uncle
my
mother
who
lives
in
lucca
in
italy
is
very
poor
and
has
only
enough
for
herself
and
my
little
sister
christina
when
garofoli
came
to
beautiful
lucca
last
year
he
brought
me
back
with
him
oh
it
was
hard
to
leave
my
little
sister
signor
garofoli
has
a
lot
of
boys
here
some
of
them
are
chimney
sweeps
others
rag
pickers
and
those
who
are
not
strong
enough
to
work
sing
in
the
streets
or
beg
garofoli
gave
me
two
little
white
mice
to
show
to
the
public
and
i
had
to
bring
him
back
thirty
sous
every
night
as
many
sous
as
you
are
short
a
day
so
many
blows
you
get
it
is
hard
to
pick
up
thirty
sous
but
the
blows
are
hard
too
especially
when
it
garofoli
who
gives
them
so
i
did
everything
that
i
could
to
get
the
money
but
i
was
often
short
nearly
all
the
other
boys
had
their
money
when
they
returned
at
night
but
i
scarcely
ever
had
mine
and
garofoli
was
mad
there
is
another
boy
here
who
also
shows
mice
and
he
taxed
forty
sous
and
he
brings
that
sum
back
every
night
several
times
i
went
out
with
him
to
see
how
he
made
it
he
paused
well
i
asked
oh
the
ladies
always
said
it
to
the
pretty
little
one
not
the
ugly
boy
the
ugly
one
of
course
was
i
so
i
did
not
go
out
with
him
any
more
a
blow
hurts
but
it
hurts
more
to
have
things
like
that
said
and
before
a
lot
of
people
you
do
know
that
because
no
one
has
ever
told
you
that
you
are
ugly
well
when
garofoli
saw
that
beating
me
did
do
any
good
he
tried
another
way
each
night
he
took
away
some
of
my
supper
it
hard
but
i
ca
say
to
the
people
in
the
streets
who
are
watching
my
mice
me
something
or
i
wo
get
any
supper
they
do
give
for
that
reason
why
do
they
give
because
you
are
pretty
and
nice
or
because
you
remind
them
of
a
little
boy
they
lost
not
because
they
think
you
hungry
oh
i
know
their
ways
say
ai
it
cold
awful
cold
i
did
get
fat
on
begging
went
on
the
boy
i
got
so
pale
and
then
after
a
time
i
often
heard
people
say
poor
child
is
starving
to
death
a
suffering
look
does
what
good
looks
ca
do
but
you
have
to
be
very
starved
for
that
they
used
to
give
me
food
that
was
a
good
time
for
me
because
garofoli
had
stopped
giving
me
blows
just
then
to
see
if
it
would
hurt
me
more
to
go
without
supper
so
when
i
got
something
to
eat
outside
i
did
care
but
one
day
garofoli
came
along
and
saw
me
eating
something
a
bowl
of
soup
that
the
fruiterer
gave
me
then
he
knew
why
i
did
mind
going
without
supper
at
home
after
that
he
made
me
stay
at
home
and
look
after
the
soup
here
every
morning
before
he
goes
out
he
puts
the
meat
and
the
vegetables
into
the
saucepan
and
locks
the
lid
on
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
see
that
it
boils
i
smell
the
soup
but
that
all
the
smell
of
the
soup
does
feed
you
it
makes
you
more
hungry
am
i
very
white
as
i
never
go
out
now
i
hear
people
say
so
and
there
no
mirror
here
you
do
seem
any
paler
than
others
i
said
ah
you
say
that
because
you
do
want
to
frighten
me
but
i
glad
i
sick
i
want
to
be
very
i
looked
at
him
in
amazement
you
do
understand
he
said
with
a
pitiful
smile
when
one
is
very
ill
they
take
care
of
you
or
they
let
you
die
if
they
let
me
die
it
will
be
all
over
i
sha
be
hungry
any
more
and
there
be
no
more
beatings
and
they
do
say
that
when
we
die
we
go
up
and
live
with
god
then
if
i
up
there
i
can
look
down
on
mamma
and
christina
and
i
can
ask
god
not
to
let
my
little
sister
be
unhappy
also
if
they
send
me
to
the
hospital
i
shall
be
pleased
the
hospital
no
matter
how
sick
i
felt
while
tramping
across
the
country
if
i
thought
i
might
be
sent
to
the
hospital
i
always
found
strength
to
go
on
i
quite
ill
now
but
not
ill
enough
to
be
in
garofoli
way
he
went
on
in
his
weak
drawling
voice
but
i
getting
weaker
garofoli
fortunately
has
given
up
beating
me
entirely
he
beat
me
on
the
head
eight
days
ago
and
look
it
all
swelled
out
now
you
see
here
this
big
bump
he
told
me
yesterday
it
was
a
tumor
and
the
way
that
he
spoke
i
believe
that
it
something
serious
it
hurts
awful
i
so
giddy
at
night
when
i
put
my
head
on
the
pillow
i
moan
and
cry
so
i
think
in
two
or
three
days
he
decide
to
send
me
to
the
hospital
i
was
in
the
hospital
once
and
the
sisters
speak
so
kind
to
you
they
say
out
your
tongue
little
boy
and
a
good
boy
every
time
you
do
anything
they
tell
you
to
do
i
think
i
am
almost
had
enough
now
to
be
sent
there
he
came
and
stood
quite
close
to
me
fixing
his
great
eyes
on
me
even
though
i
had
not
the
same
reason
for
hiding
the
truth
from
him
i
did
not
like
to
tell
him
how
terrible
he
looked
with
his
great
glittering
eyes
his
hollow
cheeks
and
his
bloodless
lips
i
should
think
you
ill
enough
to
go
to
the
hospital
i
said
at
last
with
dragging
limbs
he
went
slowly
over
to
the
table
and
began
to
wipe
it
garofoli
will
be
here
shortly
he
said
we
must
talk
any
more
wearily
he
went
round
the
table
placing
the
plates
and
spoons
i
counted
twenty
plates
so
garofoli
had
twenty
boys
as
i
only
saw
twelve
beds
they
evidently
slept
some
of
them
two
in
a
bed
what
beds
what
sheets
the
coverlets
must
have
been
brought
from
the
stables
when
they
were
too
old
and
not
warm
enough
for
the
horses
do
you
come
here
said
the
boy
try
to
get
somewhere
else
where
i
do
know
no
matter
where
you
be
better
than
here
the
door
opened
and
a
child
came
into
the
room
he
carried
a
violin
under
his
arm
and
a
big
piece
of
wood
in
his
hand
give
me
that
bit
of
wood
said
mattia
going
up
to
the
child
but
the
little
fellow
held
the
piece
of
wood
behind
his
back
no
he
said
give
it
me
for
the
fire
the
soup
be
better
do
you
think
i
brought
it
for
the
soup
i
only
made
sous
and
i
thought
this
bit
of
wood
might
save
me
a
beating
it
to
make
up
for
the
four
sous
i
short
you
have
to
pay
each
in
his
turn
mattia
said
this
mechanically
as
though
the
thought
of
the
boy
being
punished
gave
him
satisfaction
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
hard
look
come
into
his
soft
sad
eyes
i
knew
later
that
if
you
live
with
wicked
people
you
get
to
be
like
them
in
time
one
by
one
the
boys
returned
each
one
as
he
came
in
hung
his
instrument
on
a
nail
above
his
bed
those
who
were
not
musicians
but
simply
exhibitors
of
trained
animals
put
their
mice
and
guinea
pigs
into
a
cage
then
a
heavy
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
and
a
little
man
wearing
a
gray
overcoat
came
into
the
room
it
was
garofoli
the
moment
he
entered
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
with
a
look
that
scared
me
mattia
quickly
and
politely
gave
him
vitalis
message
ah
so
vitalis
is
here
he
said
what
does
he
want
i
do
know
replied
mattia
i
not
speaking
to
you
i
speaking
to
this
boy
he
is
coming
back
and
he
will
tell
you
himself
what
he
wants
i
replied
ah
here
a
little
fellow
who
knows
the
value
of
words
you
not
italian
no
i
french
the
moment
garofoli
entered
the
room
two
small
boys
took
their
places
one
on
each
side
of
him
and
were
waiting
until
he
had
finished
speaking
then
one
took
his
felt
hat
and
placed
it
carefully
on
the
bed
and
the
other
brought
forward
a
chair
they
did
this
with
the
same
gravity
and
respect
that
a
choir
boy
waits
upon
a
priest
when
garofoli
was
seated
another
little
boy
brought
him
a
pipe
stuffed
with
tobacco
and
a
fourth
offered
him
a
lighted
match
it
smells
of
sulphur
animal
he
cried
throwing
it
in
the
grate
the
culprit
hastened
to
repair
his
mistake
lighting
another
match
he
let
it
burn
for
a
time
before
offering
it
to
his
master
but
garofoli
would
not
accept
it
no
you
imbecile
he
said
pushing
the
boy
aside
roughly
then
he
turned
to
another
child
and
said
with
an
ingratiating
smile
ricardo
dearie
bring
a
match
the
dearie
hastened
to
obey
now
said
garofoli
when
he
was
comfortably
installed
and
his
pipe
burning
now
to
business
my
little
angels
bring
the
book
mattia
garofoli
made
a
sign
to
the
boy
who
had
lit
the
first
match
you
owe
me
a
sou
from
yesterday
you
promised
to
bring
it
how
much
have
you
brought
the
child
hesitated
for
a
long
time
his
face
showing
distress
one
sou
short
he
said
at
last
ah
you
one
sou
short
it
not
the
sou
for
yesterday
it
a
sou
for
that
makes
two
sous
i
never
seen
the
like
of
you
it
not
my
fault
no
excuses
you
know
the
rules
undo
your
coat
two
blows
for
yesterday
two
for
and
no
supper
for
your
impudence
ricardo
dearie
you
a
good
boy
and
you
deserve
some
recreation
take
the
strap
ricardo
the
child
who
had
lit
the
second
match
took
down
from
the
wall
a
whip
with
two
straps
meanwhile
the
boy
who
was
short
two
sous
was
unfastening
his
coat
then
he
dropped
his
shirt
baring
his
body
to
the
waist
wait
a
minute
said
garofoli
with
an
ugly
smile
you
wo
be
the
only
one
perhaps
it
always
pleasant
to
have
a
companion
the
children
stood
motionless
before
their
master
at
his
cruel
joke
they
all
forced
a
laugh
the
one
who
laughed
most
is
the
one
who
is
short
the
most
said
garofoli
i
sure
of
that
who
laughed
the
loudest
all
pointed
to
the
boy
who
had
come
home
first
bringing
his
piece
of
wood
how
much
are
you
short
you
there
demanded
garofoli
it
not
my
fault
and
the
one
who
says
not
my
fault
will
get
an
extra
cut
how
much
is
missing
i
brought
back
a
big
piece
of
wood
a
beautiful
piece
of
wood
that
something
but
go
to
the
baker
and
ask
him
to
exchange
your
wood
for
bread
will
he
do
it
how
many
sous
are
you
missing
speak
out
i
made
sous
you
four
short
you
rogue
and
you
can
stand
there
before
me
like
that
down
with
your
shirt
ricardo
dearie
you
going
to
have
a
good
time
but
the
bit
of
wood
cried
the
boy
i
give
it
to
you
for
supper
this
cruel
joke
made
all
the
children
who
were
not
to
be
punished
laugh
all
the
other
boys
were
then
questioned
as
to
how
much
they
had
brought
home
ricardo
stood
with
whip
in
hand
until
five
victims
were
placed
in
a
row
before
him
you
know
ricardo
said
garofoli
i
do
like
to
look
on
because
a
scene
like
this
always
makes
me
feel
ill
but
i
can
hear
and
from
the
noise
i
am
able
to
judge
the
strength
of
your
blows
go
at
it
heartily
dearie
you
are
working
for
your
bread
he
turned
towards
the
fire
as
though
it
were
impossible
for
him
to
witness
this
chastisement
i
in
my
corner
trembled
with
indignation
and
fear
this
was
the
man
who
was
going
to
be
my
master
if
i
did
not
bring
him
back
the
thirty
or
forty
sous
that
he
demanded
of
me
i
should
have
to
be
whipped
by
ricardo
ah
i
understood
now
how
mattia
could
speak
of
death
so
calmly
illustration
for
each
cry
you
will
receive
another
slash
the
first
lash
of
the
whip
as
it
cut
into
the
flesh
made
the
tears
spring
to
my
eyes
i
thought
that
i
was
forgotten
but
i
made
a
mistake
garofoli
was
looking
at
me
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
there
a
boy
with
a
heart
he
said
pointing
to
me
he
is
not
like
you
other
rogues
you
laugh
when
you
see
your
comrades
suffer
take
this
little
comrade
for
an
example
i
trembled
from
head
to
foot
their
comrade
at
the
second
blow
the
victim
uttered
a
wail
at
the
third
a
piercing
shriek
garofoli
lifted
his
hand
ricardo
stopped
with
raised
whip
i
thought
garofoli
was
going
to
show
mercy
but
it
was
not
so
you
know
how
much
it
hurts
me
to
hear
you
cry
said
garofoli
gently
addressing
the
victim
you
know
that
if
the
whip
tears
your
skin
your
cries
pierce
my
heart
so
then
i
warn
you
that
for
each
cry
you
will
receive
another
slash
and
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
you
have
any
affection
or
gratitude
you
will
keep
silent
go
on
ricardo
ricardo
raised
his
arm
and
the
strap
curled
on
the
backs
of
the
victims
oh
mamma
mamma
cried
one
thank
god
i
saw
no
more
of
this
frightful
torture
for
at
this
moment
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
vitalis
entered
in
a
glance
he
understood
all
he
had
heard
the
shrieks
while
climbing
the
stairs
running
to
ricardo
he
snatched
the
whip
from
him
then
wheeling
round
upon
garofoli
he
stood
before
him
with
folded
arms
it
all
happened
so
quickly
that
for
a
moment
i
was
dumbfounded
but
garofoli
quickly
recovered
himself
and
said
gently
is
it
terrible
that
child
has
no
heart
shame
it
a
shame
cried
vitalis
that
is
just
what
i
say
murmured
garofoli
stop
that
commanded
vitalis
it
you
not
the
child
what
a
cowardly
shame
to
torture
these
poor
children
who
can
not
defend
themselves
do
you
meddle
in
what
does
not
concern
you
you
old
fool
cried
garofoli
changing
his
tone
it
concerns
the
police
retorted
vitalis
you
threaten
me
with
the
police
do
you
cried
garofoli
yes
i
do
replied
my
master
nowise
intimidated
by
the
bully
fury
ah
vitalis
he
hissed
so
you
talk
well
i
can
talk
also
your
affairs
do
not
concern
me
but
there
are
others
who
are
interested
in
you
and
if
i
tell
if
i
say
one
name
ah
who
will
have
to
hide
his
head
in
shame
my
master
was
silent
shame
his
shame
i
was
amazed
but
before
i
had
time
to
think
he
had
taken
me
by
the
hand
come
remi
he
said
and
he
drew
me
to
the
door
oh
cried
garofoli
now
laughing
i
thought
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
old
fellow
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
then
without
another
word
we
went
down
the
stairs
he
still
holding
me
tightly
by
the
hand
with
what
relief
i
followed
him
i
had
escaped
from
that
tyrant
if
i
had
dared
i
would
have
thrown
my
arms
around
neck
chapter
xvii
poor
vitalis
while
we
were
in
the
street
vitalis
said
not
a
word
but
soon
we
came
to
a
narrow
alley
and
he
sat
down
on
a
and
passed
his
hand
several
times
across
his
forehead
it
may
be
fine
to
listen
to
the
voice
of
generosity
he
said
as
though
speaking
to
himself
but
now
we
in
the
gutters
of
paris
without
a
sou
not
a
bite
to
eat
are
you
hungry
he
asked
looking
up
at
me
i
have
eaten
anything
since
that
little
roll
you
gave
me
this
morning
poor
poor
child
and
you
have
to
go
to
bed
without
supper
and
where
are
we
going
to
sleep
did
you
count
on
sleeping
at
garofoli
then
i
counted
upon
you
sleeping
there
and
as
he
would
have
given
me
twenty
francs
for
you
for
the
winter
i
could
have
managed
for
the
time
being
but
seeing
the
way
he
treated
those
children
i
could
not
give
you
to
him
oh
you
are
so
good
perhaps
in
this
old
hardened
vagabond
there
is
still
a
bit
of
the
young
man
heart
left
this
old
vagabond
calculated
shrewdly
but
the
young
man
still
in
him
upset
all
now
where
to
go
he
murmured
it
was
already
late
and
the
cold
had
increased
it
was
going
to
be
a
hard
night
for
a
long
time
vitalis
sat
on
the
stone
capi
and
i
stood
silently
before
waiting
until
he
had
come
to
some
decision
finally
he
rose
where
are
we
going
to
gentilly
to
try
and
find
a
where
i
slept
sometimes
are
you
tired
i
rested
at
garofoli
the
pity
is
that
i
have
rested
and
i
ca
do
much
more
but
we
must
get
along
forward
march
children
this
was
his
good
humor
signal
for
the
dogs
and
myself
when
we
were
about
to
start
but
this
night
he
said
it
sadly
here
we
were
wandering
in
the
streets
of
paris
the
night
was
dark
and
the
gas
jets
which
flickered
in
the
wind
lit
the
alleys
but
dimly
at
each
step
we
slipped
on
the
pavement
vitalis
held
me
by
the
hand
and
capi
followed
at
our
heels
from
time
to
time
the
poor
dog
stopped
behind
to
look
amongst
a
heap
of
garbage
to
see
if
he
could
find
a
bone
or
a
crust
for
he
was
oh
so
hungry
but
the
garbage
was
covered
with
frozen
snow
and
he
searched
in
vain
with
drooping
ears
he
trotted
on
to
catch
up
with
us
after
the
big
streets
more
alleys
after
the
alleys
more
big
streets
we
walked
on
and
on
the
few
pedestrians
that
we
met
stared
at
us
in
astonishment
was
it
our
costumes
was
it
the
tired
way
we
plodded
along
which
arrested
their
attention
the
policemen
that
we
passed
turned
round
and
followed
us
with
a
glance
without
saying
a
word
vitalis
tramped
on
his
back
almost
bent
double
but
despite
the
cold
his
hand
burned
in
mine
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
trembling
sometimes
when
he
stopped
to
lean
for
a
minute
against
my
shoulder
i
felt
all
his
body
shaken
with
trembling
ordinarily
i
would
not
dare
to
have
questioned
him
but
i
felt
i
must
besides
i
had
a
great
wish
to
tell
him
how
much
i
loved
him
or
at
least
that
i
wanted
to
do
something
for
him
you
are
ill
i
said
when
he
stopped
again
i
afraid
so
anyway
i
very
tired
this
cold
is
too
severe
for
my
old
blood
i
need
a
good
bed
and
a
supper
before
a
fire
but
that
a
dream
forward
march
children
forward
march
we
had
left
the
city
behind
us
we
were
now
in
the
suburbs
we
saw
no
people
or
policemen
or
street
lights
only
a
lighted
window
here
and
there
and
over
our
heads
the
sky
dotted
with
a
few
stars
the
wind
which
blew
more
bitter
and
more
violently
stuck
our
clothing
to
our
bodies
fortunately
it
was
at
our
backs
but
as
the
sleeves
of
my
coat
were
all
torn
near
the
shoulders
it
blew
in
and
slipped
along
my
arms
chilling
me
to
the
bone
although
it
was
dark
and
the
streets
continually
crossed
each
other
vitalis
walked
like
a
man
who
knows
his
way
and
was
perfectly
sure
of
his
road
so
i
followed
feeling
sure
that
we
should
not
lose
ourselves
suddenly
he
stopped
do
you
see
a
group
of
trees
he
asked
i
do
see
anything
you
do
see
a
big
black
mass
i
looked
on
all
sides
before
answering
i
saw
no
trees
or
houses
space
all
around
us
there
was
no
other
sound
save
the
whistle
of
the
wind
see
down
there
he
stretched
out
his
right
hand
before
him
then
as
i
did
not
reply
for
i
was
afraid
to
say
that
i
saw
nothing
he
trudged
on
again
some
minutes
passed
in
silence
then
he
stopped
once
more
and
asked
me
if
i
did
not
see
a
group
of
trees
a
vague
fear
made
my
voice
tremble
when
i
replied
that
i
saw
nothing
it
is
fear
my
boy
that
makes
your
eyes
dance
look
again
i
tell
you
i
do
not
see
any
trees
not
on
the
big
road
i
ca
see
anything
we
made
a
mistake
i
could
say
nothing
for
i
did
not
know
where
we
were
nor
where
we
were
going
let
us
walk
for
another
five
minutes
and
if
we
do
not
see
the
trees
we
will
come
back
here
i
might
have
made
a
mistake
on
the
road
now
that
i
knew
that
we
had
gone
astray
i
seemed
to
have
no
more
strength
left
vitalis
pulled
me
by
the
arm
come
come
i
ca
walk
any
farther
ah
and
do
you
think
i
going
to
carry
you
i
followed
him
are
there
any
deep
ruts
in
the
road
no
then
we
must
turn
back
we
turned
now
we
faced
the
wind
it
stung
our
faces
like
a
lash
it
seemed
that
my
face
was
being
scorched
with
a
flame
we
have
to
take
a
road
leading
from
the
said
my
master
feebly
tell
me
when
you
see
it
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
went
on
struggling
against
the
wind
in
the
doleful
silence
of
the
night
the
noise
of
our
footsteps
echoed
on
the
dry
hard
earth
although
scarcely
able
to
put
one
foot
before
the
other
it
was
i
who
dragged
vitalis
how
anxiously
i
looked
to
the
left
in
the
dark
shadows
i
suddenly
saw
a
little
red
light
see
there
a
light
i
said
pointing
where
vitalis
looked
although
the
light
was
but
a
short
distance
off
he
saw
nothing
i
knew
then
that
his
sight
was
going
what
is
that
light
to
us
he
asked
it
is
a
lamp
burning
on
the
table
of
some
worker
or
it
near
the
bed
of
a
dying
person
we
can
not
go
and
knock
at
those
doors
away
in
the
country
during
the
night
you
can
ask
hospitality
but
so
near
paris
we
must
not
expect
hospitality
here
come
a
few
steps
more
and
i
thought
i
could
make
out
the
and
a
black
mass
which
must
be
the
trees
i
let
go
of
my
master
hand
to
go
ahead
quicker
there
were
deep
ruts
in
the
road
see
here
are
the
ruts
i
cried
give
me
your
hand
we
are
saved
said
vitalis
look
now
you
can
see
the
group
of
trees
i
told
him
that
i
thought
i
could
see
the
trees
in
five
minutes
we
shall
be
there
he
murmured
we
trudged
along
but
the
five
minutes
seemed
an
eternity
where
are
the
ruts
they
are
still
on
the
right
we
must
have
passed
the
entrance
to
the
without
seeing
it
i
think
we
better
go
back
once
more
we
turned
back
do
you
see
the
trees
yes
there
on
the
left
and
the
ruts
there
are
not
any
am
i
blind
asked
vitalis
in
a
low
voice
as
he
passed
his
hands
across
his
eyes
walk
straight
along
by
the
trees
and
give
me
your
hand
here
is
a
wall
no
it
a
heap
of
stones
no
i
am
sure
it
a
wall
vitalis
took
a
step
aside
to
see
if
it
really
was
as
i
said
he
stretched
out
his
two
hands
and
touched
the
wall
yes
it
a
wall
he
murmured
where
is
the
entrance
look
for
the
track
i
stooped
down
to
the
ground
and
felt
all
along
to
the
end
of
the
wall
but
i
found
no
entrance
then
turning
back
to
where
vitalis
stood
i
continued
to
feel
along
the
wall
on
the
other
side
the
result
was
the
same
there
was
no
opening
no
gate
there
is
nothing
i
said
the
situation
was
terrible
without
doubt
my
master
was
delirious
perhaps
there
was
no
here
at
all
vitalis
stood
for
a
moment
as
though
in
a
dream
capi
began
to
bark
impatiently
shall
we
look
further
i
asked
no
the
is
walled
up
walled
up
yes
they
have
closed
the
opening
and
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
get
inside
well
then
what
to
do
eh
i
do
know
die
here
oh
master
master
yes
you
do
want
to
die
you
are
so
young
life
seems
good
to
you
let
us
walk
on
can
you
still
walk
a
bit
further
my
child
oh
but
you
when
i
can
go
no
farther
i
shall
fall
down
like
an
old
horse
where
shall
we
go
return
to
paris
when
we
meet
a
policeman
we
will
let
him
take
us
to
the
police
station
i
did
not
want
that
but
i
can
not
let
you
die
of
cold
boy
come
little
remi
come
on
my
children
courage
we
turned
back
the
same
way
that
we
had
come
what
time
was
it
i
had
no
idea
we
had
walked
for
hours
a
long
long
time
and
so
slowly
perhaps
it
was
midnight
or
one
the
sky
was
still
a
somber
blue
without
moon
and
with
but
few
stars
and
the
few
that
had
appeared
seemed
to
me
to
be
smaller
than
usual
the
wind
had
increased
the
snow
beat
in
our
faces
the
houses
that
we
passed
were
closed
for
the
night
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
people
who
slept
there
warmly
beneath
the
sheets
knew
how
cold
we
were
outside
they
would
have
opened
their
doors
to
us
vitalis
walked
slower
and
slower
when
i
spoke
to
him
he
made
a
sign
to
me
to
be
silent
we
were
now
nearing
the
city
vitalis
stopped
i
knew
that
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
strength
shall
i
knock
at
one
of
the
doors
i
asked
no
they
will
not
let
us
in
they
are
gardeners
who
live
here
they
supply
the
market
they
would
not
get
up
at
this
hour
to
take
us
in
let
us
go
on
but
he
had
more
will
than
strength
after
a
moment
he
stopped
again
i
must
rest
a
little
he
said
feebly
i
ca
go
on
there
was
a
gate
leading
to
a
big
garden
the
wind
had
blown
a
lot
of
straw
that
covered
a
manure
heap
near
the
gate
into
the
street
i
am
going
to
sit
here
said
vitalis
you
said
that
if
we
sat
down
we
should
get
too
cold
to
get
up
again
he
made
no
reply
but
signed
for
me
to
heap
up
the
straw
against
the
door
then
he
fell
rather
than
sat
down
upon
it
his
teeth
chattered
and
all
his
body
shook
bring
some
more
straw
he
said
with
a
lot
of
straw
we
can
keep
the
wind
from
us
the
wind
yes
but
not
the
cold
when
i
had
gathered
up
all
the
straw
that
i
could
i
sat
down
beside
vitalis
come
quite
close
to
me
he
said
and
lift
capi
on
your
lap
he
will
give
you
some
warmth
from
his
body
vitalis
was
did
he
know
how
ill
as
i
crept
close
up
against
him
he
bent
over
and
kissed
me
that
was
the
second
time
he
had
kissed
me
alas
it
was
the
last
scarcely
had
i
cuddled
up
against
vitalis
than
i
felt
my
eyes
close
i
tried
to
keep
them
open
but
i
could
not
i
pinched
my
arms
but
there
was
no
feeling
in
my
flesh
on
my
legs
which
were
drawn
up
to
my
chest
capi
slept
already
the
wind
blew
the
wisps
of
straw
upon
us
like
dried
leaves
that
fall
from
a
tree
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
street
and
around
us
was
the
silence
of
death
this
silence
frightened
me
of
what
was
i
afraid
i
did
not
know
but
a
vague
fear
came
over
me
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
dying
there
and
then
i
felt
very
sad
i
thought
of
chavanon
of
poor
mother
barberin
must
i
die
without
seeing
her
again
and
our
little
house
and
my
little
garden
then
i
was
no
longer
cold
it
seemed
that
i
was
back
in
my
little
garden
the
sun
was
shining
and
was
so
warm
the
jonquils
were
opening
their
golden
petals
the
birds
were
singing
in
the
trees
and
on
the
hedges
yes
and
mother
barberin
was
hanging
out
the
clothes
that
she
had
just
washed
in
the
brook
which
rippled
over
the
pebbles
then
i
left
chavanon
and
joined
arthur
and
milligan
on
the
then
my
eyes
closed
again
my
heart
seemed
to
grow
heavy
and
i
remembered
no
more
chapter
xviii
new
friends
when
i
awoke
i
was
in
a
bed
and
the
flames
from
a
big
fire
lit
up
the
room
in
which
i
was
lying
i
had
never
seen
this
room
before
nor
the
people
who
stood
near
the
bed
there
was
a
man
in
a
gray
smock
and
clogs
and
three
or
four
children
one
which
i
noticed
particularly
was
a
little
girl
about
six
years
old
with
great
big
eyes
that
were
so
expressive
they
seemed
as
though
they
could
speak
i
raised
myself
on
my
elbow
they
all
came
closer
vitalis
i
asked
he
is
asking
for
his
father
said
a
girl
who
seemed
to
be
the
eldest
of
the
children
he
is
not
my
father
he
is
my
master
i
said
where
is
he
capi
if
vitalis
had
been
my
father
they
perhaps
would
have
broken
the
news
to
me
gently
but
as
he
was
only
my
master
they
thought
that
they
could
tell
me
the
truth
at
once
they
told
me
that
my
poor
master
was
dead
the
gardener
who
lived
on
the
grounds
outside
of
which
we
had
fallen
exhausted
had
found
us
early
the
next
morning
when
he
and
his
son
were
starting
off
with
their
vegetables
and
flowers
to
the
markets
they
found
us
lying
huddled
together
in
the
snow
with
a
little
covering
of
their
straw
over
us
vitalis
was
already
dead
and
i
should
have
died
but
capi
had
crept
up
to
my
chest
and
kept
my
heart
warm
they
had
carried
us
into
the
house
and
i
had
been
placed
in
one
of
the
children
warm
beds
and
capi
i
asked
when
the
gardener
stopped
talking
capi
yes
the
dog
i
do
know
he
disappeared
he
followed
the
body
said
one
of
the
children
did
you
see
him
benjamin
should
say
i
did
answered
another
boy
he
walked
behind
the
men
who
carried
the
stretcher
he
kept
his
head
down
and
now
and
again
he
jumped
up
on
the
body
and
when
they
made
him
get
down
he
moaned
and
howled
something
terrible
poor
capi
how
many
times
as
an
actor
had
he
not
followed
funeral
even
the
most
serious
children
had
been
obliged
to
laugh
at
his
display
of
grief
the
more
he
moaned
the
more
they
had
laughed
the
gardener
and
his
children
left
me
alone
not
knowing
quite
what
to
do
or
what
i
was
going
to
do
i
got
up
and
dressed
my
harp
had
been
placed
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
upon
which
i
was
lying
i
passed
the
strap
over
my
shoulder
and
went
into
the
room
where
the
family
were
i
should
have
to
go
but
where
while
in
bed
i
had
not
felt
very
weak
but
now
i
could
scarcely
stand
i
was
obliged
to
hold
on
to
a
chair
to
keep
from
falling
the
odor
of
the
soup
was
too
much
for
me
i
was
reminded
brutally
that
i
had
eaten
nothing
the
night
before
i
felt
faint
and
staggering
i
dropped
into
a
chair
by
the
fire
do
you
feel
well
my
boy
asked
the
gardener
i
told
him
that
i
did
not
feel
very
well
and
i
asked
him
to
let
me
sit
by
the
fire
for
a
little
while
but
it
was
not
the
heat
that
i
wanted
it
was
food
i
felt
weaker
as
i
watched
the
family
take
their
soup
if
i
had
dared
i
would
have
asked
for
a
bowl
but
vitalis
had
taught
me
not
to
beg
i
could
not
tell
them
i
was
hungry
why
i
do
know
quite
unless
it
was
that
i
could
not
ask
for
anything
that
i
was
unable
to
return
the
little
girl
with
the
strange
look
in
her
eyes
and
whose
name
was
lise
sat
opposite
to
me
suddenly
she
got
up
from
the
table
and
taking
her
bowl
which
was
full
of
soup
she
brought
it
over
to
me
and
placed
it
on
my
knees
weakly
for
i
could
no
longer
speak
i
nodded
my
head
to
thank
her
the
father
did
not
give
me
time
to
speak
even
if
i
had
been
able
take
it
my
boy
he
said
what
lise
gives
is
given
with
a
kind
heart
there
is
more
if
you
want
more
if
i
want
more
the
bowl
of
soup
was
swallowed
in
a
few
seconds
when
i
put
down
the
soup
lise
who
had
remained
standing
before
me
heaved
a
little
sigh
of
content
then
she
took
my
bowl
and
held
it
out
to
her
father
to
have
it
refilled
and
when
it
was
full
she
brought
it
to
me
with
such
a
sweet
smile
that
in
spite
of
my
hunger
i
sat
staring
at
her
without
thinking
to
take
it
from
her
the
second
bowlful
disappeared
promptly
like
the
first
it
was
no
longer
a
smile
that
curved
lise
pretty
lips
she
burst
out
laughing
well
my
boy
said
her
father
you
got
an
appetite
and
no
mistake
i
was
much
ashamed
but
after
a
moment
i
thought
it
better
to
confess
the
truth
than
to
be
thought
a
glutton
so
i
told
them
that
i
had
not
had
any
supper
the
night
before
and
dinner
no
dinner
either
and
your
master
he
had
eaten
either
then
he
died
as
much
from
starvation
as
from
cold
the
hot
soup
had
given
me
strength
i
got
up
to
go
where
are
you
going
asked
the
father
i
do
know
got
any
friends
or
relations
in
paris
no
where
do
you
live
we
had
any
home
we
only
got
to
the
city
yesterday
what
are
you
going
to
do
then
play
my
harp
and
get
a
little
money
in
paris
you
had
better
return
to
your
parents
in
the
country
where
do
they
live
i
have
any
parents
my
master
bought
me
from
my
foster
parents
you
have
been
good
to
me
and
i
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
and
if
you
like
i
come
back
here
on
sunday
and
play
my
harp
while
you
dance
while
speaking
i
had
walked
towards
the
door
but
i
had
only
taken
a
few
steps
when
lise
who
followed
me
took
my
hand
and
pointed
to
my
harp
you
want
me
to
play
now
i
asked
smiling
at
her
she
nodded
and
clapped
her
hands
although
i
had
no
heart
to
play
i
played
my
prettiest
waltz
for
this
little
girl
at
first
she
listened
with
her
big
beautiful
eyes
fixed
on
me
then
she
began
to
keep
time
with
her
feet
and
very
soon
was
dancing
gayly
round
the
kitchen
while
her
brothers
and
sisters
watched
her
her
father
was
delighted
when
the
waltz
was
finished
the
child
came
and
made
me
a
pretty
curtsy
i
would
have
played
for
her
all
day
but
the
father
thought
she
had
danced
enough
so
instead
i
sang
the
neapolitan
song
that
vitalis
had
taught
me
lise
stood
opposite
me
moving
her
lips
as
though
repeating
the
words
then
suddenly
she
turned
round
and
threw
herself
into
her
father
arms
crying
that
enough
music
said
the
father
is
she
a
silly
said
the
brother
named
benjamin
scoffingly
first
she
dances
and
then
she
cries
she
not
so
silly
as
you
retorted
the
elder
sister
leaning
over
the
little
one
affectionately
she
understands
while
lise
cried
on
her
father
knee
i
again
strapped
my
harp
to
my
shoulder
and
made
for
the
door
where
are
you
going
asked
the
gardener
would
you
like
to
stay
here
and
work
it
wo
be
an
easy
life
you
have
to
get
up
very
early
in
the
morning
and
work
hard
all
day
but
you
may
be
sure
that
you
wo
have
to
go
through
what
you
did
last
night
you
will
have
a
bed
and
food
and
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
have
earned
it
and
if
you
a
good
boy
which
i
think
you
are
you
will
be
one
of
the
family
lise
turned
round
and
through
her
tears
she
looked
at
me
and
smiled
i
could
hardly
believe
what
i
heard
i
just
stared
at
the
gardener
then
lise
jumped
off
her
father
knee
and
came
up
and
took
my
hand
well
what
do
you
say
boy
asked
the
father
a
family
i
should
have
a
family
i
should
not
be
alone
the
man
i
had
lived
with
for
several
years
who
had
been
almost
a
father
to
me
was
dead
and
dear
good
capi
my
companion
and
friend
whom
i
loved
so
much
was
lost
i
had
thought
that
all
was
over
for
me
and
here
was
this
good
man
offering
to
take
me
into
his
family
life
would
begin
again
for
me
he
said
he
offered
me
food
and
lodging
but
what
meant
more
to
me
was
this
home
life
which
would
be
mine
also
these
boys
would
be
my
brothers
this
pretty
little
lise
would
be
my
sister
i
would
no
longer
be
nobody
boy
in
my
childish
dreams
i
had
more
than
once
thought
i
might
find
my
father
and
mother
but
i
had
never
thought
that
i
should
have
brothers
and
sisters
and
this
was
what
was
being
offered
to
me
i
quickly
slipped
the
strap
of
my
harp
from
off
my
shoulders
there
his
reply
said
the
father
laughing
i
can
see
by
your
face
how
pleased
you
are
no
need
for
you
to
say
anything
hang
your
harp
up
there
on
the
wall
and
when
you
get
tired
of
us
you
may
take
it
down
and
go
on
your
way
again
but
you
must
do
like
the
swallows
choose
your
season
to
start
on
your
flight
do
go
off
in
the
depth
of
winter
my
new
family
consisted
of
the
father
whose
name
was
pierre
acquin
two
boys
alexix
and
benjamin
and
two
girls
etiennette
the
elder
and
lise
the
youngest
of
the
family
lise
was
dumb
she
was
not
born
dumb
but
just
before
her
fourth
birthday
through
an
illness
she
had
lost
the
power
of
speech
this
affliction
fortunately
had
not
impaired
her
intelligence
quite
the
contrary
her
intelligence
was
developed
to
an
extraordinary
degree
she
seemed
to
understand
everything
and
her
sweet
pretty
ways
made
her
adored
by
the
family
since
the
mother
had
died
etiennette
had
been
mother
to
the
family
she
had
left
school
early
to
stay
at
home
to
cook
and
sew
and
clean
the
house
for
her
father
and
brothers
they
had
quite
forgotten
that
she
was
the
daughter
the
sister
they
were
so
accustomed
to
seeing
her
doing
the
work
of
a
servant
for
she
seldom
went
out
and
was
never
angry
carrying
lise
in
her
arms
dragging
benny
by
the
hand
getting
up
at
daybreak
to
get
her
father
breakfast
going
to
bed
late
after
washing
the
dishes
she
had
not
had
time
to
be
a
child
at
fourteen
years
her
face
was
serious
and
sad
it
was
not
the
face
of
a
little
girl
five
minutes
after
i
had
hung
my
harp
on
the
wall
i
was
telling
them
all
what
had
happened
the
night
before
how
we
had
hoped
to
sleep
on
the
when
i
heard
a
scratching
on
the
door
which
opened
onto
the
garden
then
there
was
a
plaintive
whine
capi
capi
i
cried
jumping
up
quickly
but
lise
was
before
me
she
had
already
opened
the
door
capi
sprang
upon
me
i
took
him
in
my
arms
with
little
howls
of
joy
and
his
whole
body
trembling
he
licked
my
face
and
capi
i
asked
my
question
was
understood
well
capi
will
remain
with
you
of
course
said
the
father
as
though
he
knew
what
we
were
saying
the
dog
jumped
to
the
ground
and
putting
his
paw
straight
on
his
heart
he
bowed
it
made
the
children
laugh
especially
lise
and
to
amuse
them
i
wanted
capi
to
perform
some
of
his
tricks
but
he
had
no
wish
to
obey
me
he
jumped
on
my
knee
and
commenced
to
lick
my
face
then
he
sprung
down
and
began
to
drag
me
by
the
sleeve
of
my
coat
he
wants
me
to
go
out
to
take
you
to
your
master
the
police
who
had
taken
vitalis
away
had
said
that
they
wished
to
question
me
when
i
was
better
it
was
very
uncertain
as
to
when
they
would
come
and
i
was
anxious
to
have
news
perhaps
vitalis
was
not
dead
as
they
had
thought
perhaps
there
was
still
a
spark
of
life
left
in
my
master
body
upon
seeing
my
anxiety
monsieur
acquin
offered
to
take
me
to
the
police
station
when
we
arrived
there
i
was
questioned
at
length
but
i
would
give
no
information
until
they
had
declared
that
poor
vitalis
was
really
dead
then
i
told
them
what
i
knew
it
was
very
little
of
myself
i
was
able
to
say
that
i
had
no
parents
and
that
vitalis
had
hired
me
for
a
sum
of
money
which
he
had
paid
in
advance
to
my
foster
husband
and
now
inquired
the
commissioner
we
are
going
to
take
care
of
him
interrupted
my
new
friend
that
is
if
you
will
let
us
the
commissioner
was
willing
to
confide
me
to
his
care
and
complimented
him
upon
his
kind
act
it
is
not
easy
for
a
child
to
hide
much
from
a
police
officer
who
knows
his
business
they
very
soon
trap
persons
into
telling
what
they
wish
to
hide
this
was
so
in
my
case
the
commissioner
had
quickly
gleaned
from
me
all
about
garofoli
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
take
him
to
this
chap
garofoli
he
said
to
one
of
his
men
once
in
the
street
he
mentions
he
will
soon
recognize
the
house
you
can
go
up
with
him
and
question
the
man
the
three
of
us
started
as
the
officer
had
said
we
found
the
street
and
the
house
we
went
up
to
the
fourth
floor
i
did
not
see
mattia
he
had
probably
been
taken
off
to
the
hospital
upon
seeing
the
officer
and
recognizing
me
garofoli
paled
and
looked
frightened
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
when
he
learned
that
they
had
only
come
to
question
him
about
vitalis
so
the
old
fellow
is
dead
he
said
you
know
him
well
tell
us
all
you
can
about
him
there
is
not
much
to
tell
his
name
was
not
vitalis
he
was
carlo
balzini
and
if
you
had
lived
or
forty
years
ago
in
italy
that
name
alone
would
tell
you
all
you
want
to
know
carlo
balzini
was
the
greatest
singer
of
the
day
he
sang
in
naples
rome
milan
venice
florence
london
and
paris
then
came
the
time
when
he
lost
his
magnificent
voice
and
as
he
could
not
be
the
greatest
of
singers
he
would
not
dim
his
fame
by
singing
on
cheaper
stages
unworthy
of
his
great
reputation
instead
he
preferred
to
hide
himself
from
the
world
and
from
all
who
had
known
him
in
his
triumph
yet
he
had
to
live
he
tried
several
professions
but
could
not
succeed
then
finally
he
took
to
training
dogs
but
in
his
poverty
he
was
still
very
proud
and
he
would
have
died
of
shame
if
the
public
could
have
known
that
the
brilliant
carlo
balzini
had
sunk
to
the
depths
he
had
it
was
just
a
matter
of
chance
that
i
learned
his
secret
poor
carlo
balzini
dear
dear
vitalis
chapter
xix
disaster
vitalis
had
to
be
buried
the
next
day
and
acquin
promised
to
take
me
to
the
funeral
but
the
next
day
i
could
not
rise
from
my
bed
for
in
the
night
i
was
taken
very
my
chest
seemed
to
burn
like
poor
little
after
he
had
spent
the
night
in
the
tree
the
doctor
was
called
in
i
had
pneumonia
the
doctor
wanted
me
sent
to
the
hospital
but
the
family
would
not
hear
of
it
it
was
during
this
illness
that
i
learned
to
appreciate
etiennette
goodness
she
devoted
herself
to
nursing
me
how
good
and
kind
she
was
during
that
terrible
sickness
when
she
was
obliged
to
leave
me
to
attend
to
her
household
duties
lise
took
her
place
and
many
times
in
my
delirium
i
saw
little
lise
sitting
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
with
her
big
eyes
fixed
on
me
anxiously
in
my
delirium
i
thought
that
she
was
my
guardian
angel
and
i
would
speak
to
her
and
tell
her
of
all
my
hopes
and
desires
it
was
from
this
time
that
i
began
to
consider
her
as
something
ideal
as
a
different
being
from
the
other
people
i
met
it
seemed
surprising
that
she
could
live
in
our
life
in
my
boyish
imagination
i
could
picture
her
flying
away
with
big
white
wings
to
a
more
beautiful
world
i
was
ill
for
a
very
long
time
at
night
when
i
was
almost
suffocating
i
had
to
have
some
one
to
sit
up
with
me
then
alexix
and
benny
would
take
turns
at
last
i
was
convalescent
and
then
it
was
lise
who
replaced
etiennette
and
walked
with
me
down
by
the
river
of
course
during
these
walks
she
could
not
talk
but
strange
to
say
we
had
no
need
of
words
we
seemed
to
understand
each
other
so
well
without
talking
then
came
the
day
when
i
was
strong
enough
to
work
with
the
others
in
the
garden
i
had
been
impatient
to
commence
for
i
wanted
to
do
something
for
my
kind
friends
who
had
done
so
much
for
me
as
i
was
still
weak
the
task
that
was
given
to
me
was
in
proportion
to
my
strength
every
morning
after
the
frost
had
passed
i
had
to
lift
the
glass
frames
and
at
night
before
it
got
chilly
i
had
to
close
them
again
during
the
day
i
had
to
shade
the
wall
flowers
with
straw
coverings
to
protect
them
from
the
sun
this
was
not
difficult
to
do
but
it
took
all
my
time
for
i
had
several
hundred
glasses
to
move
twice
daily
days
and
months
passed
i
was
very
happy
sometimes
i
thought
that
i
was
too
happy
it
could
not
last
acquin
was
considered
one
of
the
cleverest
florists
round
about
paris
after
the
wall
flower
season
was
over
other
flowers
replaced
them
for
many
weeks
we
had
been
working
very
hard
as
the
season
promised
to
be
an
especially
good
one
we
had
not
even
taken
a
rest
on
sunday
but
as
all
the
flowers
were
now
perfect
and
ready
for
the
approaching
season
it
was
decided
that
for
a
reward
we
were
all
to
go
and
have
dinner
on
sunday
august
with
one
of
acquin
friends
who
was
also
a
florist
capi
was
to
be
one
of
the
party
we
were
to
work
until
four
and
when
all
was
finished
we
were
to
lock
the
gates
and
go
to
arcueil
supper
was
for
six
after
supper
we
were
to
come
home
at
once
so
as
not
to
be
late
in
getting
to
bed
as
monday
morning
we
had
to
be
up
bright
and
early
ready
for
work
a
few
minutes
before
four
we
were
all
ready
come
on
all
of
you
cried
acquin
gayly
i
going
to
lock
the
gates
come
capi
taking
lise
by
the
hand
i
began
to
run
with
her
capi
jumped
around
us
barking
we
were
all
dressed
up
in
our
best
and
looking
forward
to
a
good
dinner
some
people
turned
round
to
watch
us
as
we
passed
i
know
what
i
looked
like
but
lise
in
her
blue
dress
and
white
shoes
was
the
prettiest
little
girl
that
one
could
see
time
passed
quickly
we
were
having
dinner
out
of
doors
when
just
as
we
had
finished
one
of
us
remarked
how
dark
it
was
getting
clouds
were
gathering
quickly
in
the
sky
children
we
must
go
home
said
acquin
there
going
to
be
a
storm
go
already
came
the
chorus
if
the
wind
rises
all
the
glasses
will
be
upset
we
all
knew
the
value
of
those
glass
frames
and
what
they
mean
to
a
florist
it
would
be
terrible
for
us
if
the
wind
broke
ours
i
hurry
ahead
with
benny
and
alexix
the
father
said
remi
can
come
on
with
etiennette
and
lise
they
rushed
off
etiennette
and
i
followed
more
slowly
with
lise
no
one
laughed
now
the
sky
grew
darker
the
storm
was
coming
quickly
clouds
of
dust
swirled
around
us
we
had
to
turn
our
backs
and
cover
our
eyes
with
our
hands
for
the
dust
blinded
us
there
was
a
streak
of
lightning
across
the
sky
then
came
a
heavy
clap
of
thunder
etiennette
and
i
had
taken
lise
by
the
hands
we
were
trying
to
drag
her
along
faster
but
she
could
scarcely
keep
up
with
us
would
the
father
benny
and
alexix
get
home
before
the
storm
broke
if
they
were
only
in
time
to
close
the
glass
cases
so
that
the
wind
could
not
get
under
them
and
upset
them
the
thunder
increased
the
clouds
were
so
heavy
that
it
seemed
almost
night
then
suddenly
there
was
a
downpour
of
hail
the
stones
struck
us
in
the
face
and
we
had
to
race
to
take
shelter
under
a
big
gateway
in
a
minute
the
road
was
covered
with
white
like
in
winter
the
hailstones
were
as
large
as
pigeon
eggs
as
they
fell
they
made
a
deafening
sound
and
every
now
and
again
we
could
hear
the
crash
of
broken
glass
with
the
hailstones
as
they
slid
from
the
roofs
to
the
street
fell
all
sorts
of
things
pieces
of
slate
chimney
pots
tiles
etc
oh
the
glass
frames
cried
etiennette
i
had
the
same
thought
even
if
they
get
there
before
the
hail
they
will
never
have
time
to
cover
the
glasses
with
straw
everything
will
be
ruined
they
say
that
hail
only
falls
in
places
i
said
trying
to
hope
still
oh
this
is
too
near
home
for
us
to
escape
if
it
falls
on
the
garden
the
same
as
here
poor
father
will
be
ruined
and
he
counted
so
much
on
those
flowers
he
needs
the
money
so
badly
i
had
heard
that
the
glass
frames
cost
as
much
as
francs
a
hundred
and
i
knew
what
a
disaster
it
would
be
if
the
hail
broke
our
five
or
six
hundred
without
counting
the
plants
and
the
conservatories
i
would
liked
to
have
questioned
etiennette
but
we
could
scarcely
hear
each
other
speak
and
she
did
not
seem
disposed
to
talk
she
looked
at
the
hail
falling
with
a
hopeless
expression
like
a
person
would
look
upon
his
house
burning
the
hurricane
lasted
but
a
short
while
it
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
had
commenced
it
lasted
perhaps
six
minutes
the
clouds
swept
over
paris
and
we
were
able
to
leave
our
shelter
the
hailstones
were
thick
on
the
ground
lise
could
not
walk
in
them
in
her
thin
shoes
so
i
took
her
on
my
back
and
carried
her
her
pretty
face
which
was
so
bright
when
going
to
the
party
was
now
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
before
long
we
reached
the
house
the
big
gates
were
open
and
we
went
quickly
into
the
garden
what
a
sight
met
our
eyes
all
the
glass
frames
were
smashed
to
atoms
flowers
pieces
of
glass
and
hailstones
were
all
heaped
together
in
our
once
beautiful
garden
everything
was
shattered
where
was
the
father
we
searched
for
him
last
of
all
we
found
him
in
the
big
conservatory
of
which
every
pane
of
glass
was
broken
he
was
seated
on
a
wheelbarrow
in
the
midst
of
the
d√©bris
which
covered
the
ground
alexix
and
benjamin
stood
beside
him
silently
my
children
my
poor
little
ones
he
cried
when
we
all
were
there
he
took
lise
in
his
arms
and
began
to
sob
he
said
nothing
more
what
could
he
have
said
it
was
a
terrible
catastrophe
but
the
consequences
were
still
more
terrible
i
soon
learned
this
from
etiennette
ten
years
ago
their
father
had
bought
the
garden
and
had
built
the
house
himself
the
man
who
had
sold
him
the
ground
had
also
lent
him
the
money
to
buy
the
necessary
materials
required
by
a
florist
the
amount
was
payable
in
yearly
payments
for
fifteen
years
the
man
was
only
waiting
for
an
occasion
when
the
florist
would
be
late
in
payment
to
take
back
the
ground
house
material
keeping
of
course
the
payments
that
he
had
already
received
this
was
a
speculation
on
the
man
part
for
he
had
hoped
that
before
the
fifteen
years
expired
there
would
come
a
day
when
the
florist
would
be
unable
to
meet
his
notes
this
day
had
come
at
last
now
what
was
going
to
happen
we
were
not
left
long
in
doubt
the
day
after
the
notes
fell
due
this
sum
which
was
to
have
been
paid
from
the
sale
of
his
season
flowers
a
gentleman
dressed
all
in
black
came
to
the
house
and
handed
us
a
stamped
paper
it
was
the
process
server
he
came
often
so
many
times
that
he
soon
began
to
know
us
by
name
how
do
you
do
mlle
etiennette
hello
remi
hello
alexix
and
he
handed
us
his
stamped
paper
smilingly
as
though
we
were
friends
the
father
did
not
stay
in
the
house
he
was
always
out
he
never
told
us
where
he
went
probably
he
went
to
call
on
business
men
or
he
might
have
been
at
court
what
would
the
result
be
a
part
of
the
winter
passed
as
we
were
unable
to
repair
the
conservatories
and
renew
the
glass
frames
we
cultivated
vegetables
and
hardier
flowers
that
did
not
demand
shelter
they
were
not
very
productive
but
at
least
it
was
something
and
it
was
work
for
us
one
evening
the
father
returned
home
more
depressed
than
usual
children
he
said
it
is
all
over
i
was
about
to
leave
the
room
for
i
felt
that
he
had
something
serious
to
say
to
his
children
he
signed
to
me
to
stop
you
are
one
of
the
family
remi
he
said
sadly
and
although
you
are
not
very
old
you
know
what
trouble
is
children
i
am
going
to
leave
you
there
was
a
cry
on
all
sides
lise
flung
her
arms
round
her
father
neck
he
held
her
very
tight
ah
it
hard
to
leave
you
dear
children
he
said
but
the
courts
have
ordered
me
to
pay
and
as
i
have
no
money
everything
here
has
to
be
sold
and
as
that
is
not
enough
i
have
to
go
to
prison
for
five
years
as
i
am
not
able
to
pay
with
my
money
i
have
to
pay
with
my
liberty
we
all
began
to
cry
yes
it
sad
he
continued
brokenly
but
a
man
ca
do
anything
against
the
law
my
attorney
says
that
it
used
to
be
worse
than
it
is
there
was
a
tearful
silence
this
is
what
i
have
decided
is
the
best
thing
to
do
continued
the
father
remi
who
is
the
best
scholar
will
write
to
my
sister
catherine
and
explain
the
matter
to
her
and
ask
her
to
come
to
us
aunt
catherine
has
plenty
of
common
sense
and
she
will
be
able
to
decide
what
should
be
done
for
the
best
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
written
a
letter
and
this
was
a
very
painful
one
but
we
still
had
a
ray
of
hope
we
were
very
ignorant
children
and
the
fact
that
aunt
catherine
was
coming
and
that
she
was
practical
made
us
hope
that
everything
could
be
made
right
but
she
did
not
come
as
soon
as
we
had
hoped
a
few
days
later
the
father
had
just
left
the
house
to
call
on
one
of
his
friends
when
he
met
the
police
face
to
face
coming
for
him
he
returned
to
the
house
with
them
he
was
very
pale
he
had
come
to
say
to
his
children
do
be
so
downcast
man
said
one
of
them
who
had
come
to
take
him
to
be
in
prison
for
debt
is
not
so
dreadful
as
you
seem
to
think
you
find
some
very
good
fellows
there
i
went
to
fetch
the
two
boys
who
were
in
the
garden
little
lise
was
sobbing
one
of
the
men
stooped
down
and
whispered
something
in
her
ear
but
i
did
not
hear
what
he
said
the
parting
was
over
very
quickly
acquin
caught
lise
up
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
then
he
put
her
down
but
she
clung
to
his
hand
then
he
kissed
etiennette
alexix
and
benny
and
gave
lise
into
her
sister
care
i
stood
a
little
apart
but
he
came
to
me
and
kissed
me
affectionately
just
like
the
others
and
then
they
took
him
away
we
all
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
crying
not
one
of
us
had
a
word
to
say
aunt
catherine
arrived
an
hour
later
we
were
still
crying
bitterly
for
a
country
woman
who
had
no
education
or
money
the
responsibility
that
had
fallen
upon
her
was
heavy
a
family
of
destitute
children
the
eldest
not
yet
sixteen
the
youngest
a
dumb
girl
aunt
catherine
had
been
a
nurse
in
a
lawyer
family
she
at
once
called
upon
this
man
to
ask
his
advice
and
it
was
he
who
decided
our
fate
when
she
returned
from
the
lawyer
she
told
us
what
had
been
arranged
lise
was
to
go
and
live
with
her
alexix
was
to
go
to
an
uncle
at
varses
benny
to
another
uncle
who
was
a
florist
at
and
etiennette
to
an
aunt
who
lived
at
the
seashore
i
listened
to
these
plans
waiting
until
they
came
to
me
when
aunt
catherine
ceased
speaking
and
i
had
not
been
mentioned
i
said
and
me
why
you
do
belong
to
the
family
i
work
for
you

not
one
of
the
family
ask
alexix
and
benny

eh
but
he
one
of
the
family
yes
aunt
he
one
of
the
family
came
from
all
sides
lise
came
forwards
and
clasped
her
hands
before
her
aunt
with
an
expression
that
said
more
than
words
poor
mite
said
aunt
catherine

know

come
and

you
a
relation
and
i
going
to
have
you
with
me
it
will
be
like
that
with
your
other
uncles
and
aunts
they
will
take
a
relation
but
not
strangers
i
felt
there
was
nothing
to
say
what
she
said
was
only
too
true
i
was
not
one
of
the
family
i
could
claim
nothing
ask
nothing
that
would
be
begging
and
yet
i
loved
them
all
and
they
all
loved
me
aunt
catherine
sent
us
to
bed
after
telling
us
that
we
were
to
be
parted
the
next
day
scarcely
had
we
got
upstairs
than
they
all
crowded
round
me
lise
clung
to
me
crying
then
i
knew
that
in
spite
of
their
grief
at
parting
from
one
another
it
was
of
me
that
they
thought
they
pitied
me
because
i
was
alone
i
felt
indeed
then
that
i
was
their
brother
suddenly
an
idea
came
to
me
listen
i
said
even
if
your
aunts
and
uncles
do
want
me
i
can
see
that
you
consider
me
one
of
the
family
yes
yes
they
all
cried
lise
who
could
not
speak
just
squeezed
my
hand
and
looked
up
at
me
with
her
big
beautiful
eyes
well
i
a
brother
and
i
prove
it
i
said
stoutly
there
a
job
with
pernuit
shall
i
go
over
and
speak
to
him
asked
etiennette
i
do
want
a
job
if
i
take
a
job
i
shall
have
to
stay
in
paris
and
i
sha
see
you
again
i
going
to
put
on
my
sheepskin
and
take
my
harp
and
go
first
to
one
place
and
then
to
another
where
you
are
all
going
to
live
i
shall
see
you
all
one
after
the
other
and
i
carry
the
news
from
one
to
the
other
so
you
all
be
in
touch
i
forgotten
my
songs
nor
my
dance
music
and
i
get
enough
money
to
live
every
face
beamed
i
was
glad
they
were
so
pleased
with
my
idea
for
a
long
time
we
talked
then
etiennette
made
each
one
go
to
bed
but
no
one
slept
much
that
night
i
least
of
all
the
next
day
at
daybreak
lise
took
me
into
the
garden
you
want
to
speak
to
me
i
asked
she
nodded
her
head
you
are
unhappy
because
we
are
going
to
be
parted
you
need
not
tell
me
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
and
i
am
unhappy
too
she
made
a
sign
that
it
was
something
else
she
wanted
to
say
in
fifteen
days
i
shall
be
at
dreuzy
where
you
are
going
to
live
she
shook
her
head
you
do
want
me
to
go
to
dreuzy
in
order
for
us
to
understand
each
other
i
made
more
progress
by
questioning
she
replied
either
with
a
nod
or
a
shake
of
the
head
she
told
me
that
she
wanted
to
see
me
at
dreuzy
but
pointing
her
finger
in
three
directions
she
made
me
understand
that
i
must
first
go
and
see
her
brothers
and
sister
you
want
me
first
to
go
to
varses
then
esnandes
and
then
she
smiled
and
nodded
pleased
that
i
understood
why
then
with
her
lips
and
hands
and
above
all
with
her
eyes
she
explained
to
me
why
she
wished
this
she
wanted
me
to
go
and
see
her
sister
and
brothers
first
so
that
when
i
reached
dreuzy
i
could
tell
her
news
of
them
they
had
to
start
at
eight
and
aunt
catherine
had
ordered
a
cab
to
take
them
first
of
all
to
the
prison
to
say
to
their
father
and
then
each
with
their
baggage
to
the
different
depots
where
they
had
to
take
their
trains
at
seven
etiennette
in
her
turn
took
me
in
the
garden
i
want
to
give
you
a
little
keepsake
remi
she
said
take
this
little
case
my
godfather
gave
it
to
me
you
find
thread
needles
and
scissors
in
it
when
you
are
tramping
along
the
roads
you
need
them
for
i
sha
be
there
to
put
a
patch
on
your
clothes
nor
sew
a
button
on
when
you
use
my
scissors
think
of
us
all
while
etiennette
was
speaking
to
me
alexix
loitered
near
when
she
left
me
to
return
to
the
house
he
came
up
say
remi
he
began
i
got
two
five
franc
pieces
take
one
be
so
pleased
if
you
will
of
the
five
of
us
alexix
was
the
only
one
who
cared
very
much
for
money
we
always
made
fun
of
his
greed
he
saved
up
sou
by
sou
counting
his
hoard
continually
he
was
always
very
proud
when
he
had
a
brand
new
piece
his
offer
touched
me
to
the
heart
i
wanted
to
refuse
but
he
insisted
and
slipped
a
shiny
silver
piece
into
my
hand
i
knew
that
his
friendship
for
me
must
be
very
strong
if
he
were
willing
to
share
his
treasure
with
me
benjamin
neither
had
forgotten
me
he
also
wanted
to
give
me
a
present
he
gave
me
his
knife
and
in
exchange
he
exacted
a
sou
because
he
said
a
knife
cuts
friendship
the
time
passed
quickly
the
moment
had
come
for
us
to
part
as
the
cab
was
drawing
up
at
the
house
lise
again
made
a
sign
for
me
to
follow
her
into
the
garden
lise
called
her
aunt
she
made
no
reply
but
ran
quickly
down
the
path
she
stopped
at
a
big
bengal
rose
tree
and
cut
off
a
branch
then
turning
to
me
she
divided
the
stalk
in
two
there
was
a
rose
on
either
side
the
language
of
the
lips
is
a
small
thing
compared
with
the
language
of
the
eyes
how
cold
and
empty
are
words
compared
with
looks
lise
lise
cried
her
aunt
the
baggage
was
already
in
the
cab
i
took
down
my
harp
and
called
to
capi
at
the
sight
of
my
old
suit
he
jumped
and
barked
with
joy
he
loved
his
liberty
on
the
high
roads
more
than
being
closed
up
in
the
garden
they
all
got
into
the
cab
i
lifted
lise
onto
her
aunt
lap
i
stood
there
half
dazed
then
the
aunt
gently
pushed
me
away
and
closed
the
door
they
were
off
through
a
mist
i
watched
lise
as
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
waving
her
hand
to
me
then
the
cab
sharply
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
and
all
i
could
see
was
a
cloud
of
dust
leaning
on
my
harp
with
capi
sprawling
at
my
feet
i
stayed
there
looking
absently
down
the
street
a
neighbor
who
had
been
asked
to
lock
up
the
house
and
keep
the
key
called
to
me
are
you
going
to
stay
there
all
day
no
i
off
now
where
are
you
going
straight
ahead
if
you
like
to
stay
he
said
perhaps
out
of
pity
i
keep
you
but
i
ca
pay
you
because
you
not
very
strong
later
i
might
give
you
something
i
thanked
him
but
said
no
well
as
you
like
i
was
only
thinking
for
your
own
good
and
good
luck
he
went
away
the
cab
had
gone
the
house
was
locked
up
i
turned
away
from
the
home
where
i
had
lived
for
two
years
and
where
i
had
hoped
always
to
live
the
sky
was
clear
the
weather
warm
very
different
from
the
icy
night
when
poor
vitalis
and
i
had
fallen
exhausted
by
the
wall
so
these
two
years
had
only
been
a
halt
i
must
go
on
my
way
again
but
the
stay
had
done
me
good
it
had
given
me
strength
and
i
had
made
dear
friends
i
was
not
now
alone
in
the
world
and
i
had
an
object
in
life
to
be
useful
and
give
pleasure
to
those
i
loved
chapter
xx
mattia
the
world
was
before
me
i
could
go
where
i
liked
north
south
east
or
west
i
was
my
own
master
how
many
children
there
are
who
say
to
themselves
if
i
could
only
do
as
i
liked
if
i
were
my
own
master
and
how
impatiently
they
look
forward
to
this
day
when
they
can
do
the
things
they
have
longed
to
do
often
very
foolish
things
between
these
children
and
myself
there
was
a
vast
difference
when
they
do
anything
foolish
there
is
a
hand
stretched
out
and
they
are
picked
up
if
they
fall
if
i
fell
i
should
go
down
down
down
and
i
might
not
be
able
to
pick
myself
up
again
i
was
afraid
i
knew
the
dangers
that
beset
me
before
beginning
my
wanderings
i
wanted
to
see
the
man
who
had
been
so
good
to
me
aunt
catherine
had
not
wished
to
take
me
with
them
when
they
had
gone
to
say
but
i
felt
that
at
least
i
could
go
and
see
him
now
that
i
was
alone
i
did
not
dare
walk
across
paris
with
capi
running
at
my
heels
i
was
afraid
that
a
policeman
would
stop
and
question
me
my
greatest
fear
was
the
police
i
tied
a
string
to
capi
collar
i
was
loath
to
do
this
for
i
knew
that
it
hurt
his
but
it
had
to
be
and
in
this
humiliating
manner
i
dragged
him
along
to
the
clichy
prison
where
acquin
was
serving
his
sentence
for
some
moments
i
looked
in
a
sort
of
fear
at
the
great
prison
doors
thinking
that
perhaps
once
they
had
closed
on
me
i
might
not
be
able
to
get
out
again
i
found
it
more
difficult
than
i
had
thought
to
get
into
a
prison
but
i
would
not
be
discouraged
after
much
waiting
and
questioning
i
was
finally
permitted
to
see
acquin
ah
remi
boy
i
was
expecting
you
he
said
as
i
entered
the
room
where
visitors
were
allowed
to
see
the
prisoners
i
scolded
aunt
catherine
for
not
bringing
you
with
the
others
i
brightened
up
at
these
words
the
children
tell
me
that
you
are
going
on
your
wanderings
again
have
you
forgotten
that
you
almost
died
of
cold
and
hunger
my
boy
no
i
not
forgotten
that
you
were
not
alone
then
you
had
some
one
to
look
after
you
at
your
age
i
do
think
it
is
right
to
go
tramping
across
the
country
alone
you
do
want
me
to
bring
you
news
of
your
children
then
i
asked
they
told
me
that
you
were
going
to
see
them
all
one
after
the
other
he
replied
but
i
am
not
thinking
of
us
when
i
ask
you
to
give
up
this
wandering
life
and
if
i
do
what
you
ask
i
should
be
thinking
of
myself
and
not
of
you
of
lise
this
time
he
looked
at
me
for
several
seconds
then
he
suddenly
took
both
my
hands
you
have
a
heart
and
i
will
not
say
another
word
my
boy
god
will
take
care
of
you
i
threw
my
arms
round
his
neck
the
time
had
come
for
me
to
say
for
some
moments
he
held
me
in
silence
then
suddenly
he
felt
in
his
vest
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
large
silver
watch
here
boy
take
this
he
said
i
want
you
to
have
it
as
a
keepsake
it
is
of
much
value
if
it
had
been
i
have
sold
it
it
does
keep
good
time
either
when
anything
is
wrong
with
it
just
give
it
a
thump
it
is
all
i
have
i
wanted
to
refuse
such
a
beautiful
present
but
he
forced
it
into
my
closed
hands
oh
i
do
need
to
know
the
time
he
said
sadly
the
hours
pass
slowly
enough
i
should
die
counting
them
little
remi
always
remember
to
be
a
good
boy
i
was
very
unhappy
how
good
he
had
been
to
me
i
lingered
round
the
prison
doors
for
a
long
time
after
i
had
left
him
i
might
have
stayed
there
perhaps
until
night
if
i
had
not
suddenly
touched
a
hard
round
object
in
my
pocket
my
watch
all
my
grief
was
forgotten
for
the
moment
my
watch
my
very
own
watch
by
which
i
could
tell
the
time
i
pulled
it
out
to
see
the
hour
midday
it
was
a
matter
of
small
importance
whether
it
was
midday
ten
or
two
yet
i
was
very
pleased
that
it
was
midday
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
why
but
such
was
the
case
i
knew
that
it
was
midday
my
watch
told
me
so
what
an
affair
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
watch
was
a
sort
of
confidential
friend
of
whom
one
could
ask
advice
and
to
whom
one
could
talk
friend
watch
what
the
time
just
twelve
my
dear
remi
really
then
it
time
for
me
to
do
this
or
that
a
good
thing
you
reminded
me
if
you
had
not
i
should
have
forgotten
in
my
joy
i
had
not
noticed
that
capi
was
almost
as
pleased
as
myself
he
pulled
me
by
the
leg
of
my
trousers
and
barked
several
times
as
he
continued
to
bark
i
was
forced
to
bestow
some
attention
upon
him
what
do
you
want
capi
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
but
i
failed
to
understand
him
he
waited
some
moments
then
came
and
stood
up
against
me
putting
his
paws
on
the
pocket
where
i
had
placed
my
watch
he
wanted
to
know
the
time
to
tell
the
distinguished
audience
like
in
the
days
when
he
had
worked
with
vitalis
i
showed
the
watch
to
him
he
looked
at
it
for
some
time
as
though
trying
to
remember
then
wagging
his
tail
he
barked
twelve
times
he
had
not
forgotten
we
could
earn
money
with
my
watch
that
was
something
i
had
not
counted
upon
forward
march
children
i
took
one
last
look
at
the
prison
behind
the
walls
of
which
little
lise
father
was
shut
then
went
on
my
way
the
thing
i
needed
most
of
all
was
a
map
of
france
knowing
that
in
the
book
stalls
on
the
quays
i
could
procure
one
i
wended
my
way
towards
the
river
at
last
i
found
one
that
was
so
yellow
that
the
man
let
me
have
it
for
fifteen
sous
i
was
able
to
leave
paris
now
and
i
decided
to
do
so
at
once
i
had
a
choice
between
two
roads
i
chose
the
road
to
fontainebleau
as
i
went
up
the
rue
mouffetard
a
host
of
memories
rushed
upon
me
garofoli
mattia
ricardo
the
soup
pot
fastened
with
a
padlock
the
whip
and
vitalis
my
poor
good
master
who
had
died
because
he
would
not
rent
me
to
the
as
i
passed
the
church
i
saw
a
little
boy
leaning
against
the
wall
and
i
thought
i
recognized
him
surely
it
was
mattia
the
boy
with
the
big
head
the
great
eyes
and
the
soft
resigned
look
but
then
he
had
not
grown
one
inch
i
went
nearer
to
see
better
yes
it
was
mattia
he
recognised
me
his
pale
face
broke
into
a
smile
ah
it
you
he
said
you
came
to
garofoli
a
long
time
ago
with
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
just
before
i
went
to
the
hospital
ah
how
i
used
to
suffer
with
my
head
then
is
garofoli
still
your
master
he
glanced
round
before
replying
then
lowering
his
voice
he
said
garofoli
is
in
prison
they
took
him
because
he
beat
orlando
to
death
i
was
shocked
at
this
i
was
pleased
to
hear
that
they
had
put
garofoli
in
prison
and
for
the
first
time
i
thought
the
prisons
which
inspired
me
with
so
much
horror
had
their
use
and
the
other
boys
i
asked
oh
i
do
know
i
was
not
there
when
garofoli
was
arrested
when
i
came
out
of
the
hospital
garofoli
seeing
that
it
was
no
good
to
beat
me
i
got
ill
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
so
he
sold
me
for
two
years
to
the
gassot
circus
they
paid
him
in
advance
d
know
the
gassot
circus
no
well
it
not
much
of
a
circus
but
it
a
circus
all
the
same
they
wanted
a
child
for
dislocation
and
garofoli
sold
me
to
gassot
i
stayed
with
him
until
last
monday
when
he
sent
me
off
because
my
head
was
too
big
to
go
into
the
box
after
leaving
the
circus
i
went
back
to
find
garofoli
but
the
place
was
all
shut
up
and
a
neighbor
told
me
what
had
happened
now
that
garofoli
in
prison
i
do
know
where
to
go
and
i
have
any
money
he
added
and
i
have
had
a
bite
to
eat
since
yesterday
i
was
not
rich
but
i
had
enough
to
give
something
to
poor
mattia
how
i
would
have
blessed
one
who
would
have
given
me
a
crust
of
bread
when
i
was
wandering
round
toulouse
famished
like
mattia
now
stay
here
until
i
come
back
i
said
i
ran
to
a
bakery
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
soon
returned
with
a
roll
which
i
offered
him
he
devoured
it
in
a
moment
now
i
said
what
do
you
want
to
do
i
do
know
i
was
trying
to
sell
my
violin
when
you
spoke
to
me
and
i
would
have
sold
it
before
if
i
had
hated
to
part
with
it
my
violin
is
all
i
have
and
when
i
sad
i
find
a
spot
where
i
can
be
alone
and
play
to
myself
then
i
see
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
in
the
sky
more
beautiful
than
in
a
dream
why
do
you
play
your
violin
in
the
streets
i
did
but
i
did
get
anything
how
well
i
knew
what
it
was
to
play
and
not
get
a
coin
what
are
you
doing
he
asked
i
do
know
why
but
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
put
up
a
ridiculous
bluff
i
the
boss
of
a
company
i
said
proudly
it
was
true
but
the
truth
was
very
near
a
falsehood
my
company
only
consisted
of
capi
oh
will
you
began
mattia
what
take
me
in
your
company
not
wishing
to
deceive
him
i
smiled
and
pointed
to
capi
but
that
is
all
the
company
i
have
i
said
well
what
does
that
matter
i
be
another
oh
please
do
leave
me
i
shall
die
of
hunger
die
of
hunger
his
words
seemed
to
strike
my
very
heart
i
knew
what
it
would
be
to
die
of
hunger
i
can
play
the
violin
and
i
can
dislocate
said
mattia
breathlessly
i
can
dance
on
the
tight
rope
i
can
sing
i
do
anything
you
like
i
be
your
servant
i
obey
you
i
do
ask
for
money
food
only
and
if
i
do
badly
you
can
beat
me
that
is
understood
all
that
i
ask
is
that
you
wo
strike
me
on
the
head
that
also
must
be
understood
because
my
head
is
very
sore
since
garofoli
beat
me
so
much
on
it
i
felt
like
crying
to
hear
poor
little
mattia
speak
so
how
could
i
refuse
to
take
him
with
me
die
of
hunger
but
with
me
there
was
also
a
chance
that
he
might
die
of
hunger
i
told
him
so
but
he
would
not
listen
to
me
no
no
he
said
when
there
are
two
one
does
starve
because
one
helps
the
other
the
one
who
has
it
gives
to
the
one
who
has
i
hesitated
no
longer
as
i
had
some
i
must
help
him
well
then
it
understood
i
said
instantly
he
took
my
hand
and
actually
kissed
it
in
gratitude
come
with
me
i
said
not
as
a
servant
mattia
but
as
my
chum
shouldering
my
harp
i
gave
the
signal
forward
march
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
had
left
paris
behind
i
left
paris
by
this
route
because
i
wanted
to
see
mother
barberin
how
many
times
i
had
wanted
to
write
to
her
and
tell
her
that
i
thought
of
her
and
that
i
loved
her
with
all
my
heart
but
the
horrible
fear
of
barberin
restrained
me
if
barberin
found
me
by
means
of
my
letter
he
might
take
me
and
sell
me
to
another
man
he
probably
had
the
right
to
do
so
i
preferred
that
mother
barberin
should
think
that
i
was
an
ungrateful
boy
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
falling
into
power
but
though
i
dared
not
write
now
that
i
was
free
i
could
go
and
see
her
since
i
had
taken
mattia
into
my
company
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
do
so
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
could
easily
be
arranged
i
would
send
him
ahead
and
he
could
find
out
if
she
were
alone
and
then
tell
her
that
i
was
not
far
off
and
was
only
waiting
to
know
if
it
were
safe
for
me
to
come
and
see
her
then
if
barberin
were
in
the
village
mattia
could
ask
her
to
come
to
some
safe
spot
where
i
could
meet
her
i
tramped
along
in
silence
working
out
this
plan
mattia
trudged
by
my
side
he
also
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
the
idea
came
to
me
to
show
off
my
possessions
to
mattia
unfastening
my
bag
i
proudly
spread
out
my
riches
on
the
grass
i
had
three
cotton
shirts
three
pairs
of
socks
five
handkerchiefs
all
in
good
condition
and
one
pair
of
shoes
slightly
used
mattia
was
awestruck
and
you
what
have
you
got
i
asked
i
only
got
my
violin
well
we
go
shares
now
we
chums
you
have
two
shirts
two
pairs
of
socks
and
three
handkerchiefs
but
as
it
only
fair
that
we
go
shares
in
everything
you
carry
my
bag
for
one
hour
and
i
carry
it
for
another
mattia
wanted
to
refuse
the
things
but
as
i
had
quickly
fallen
into
the
habit
of
commanding
which
i
must
say
i
found
very
pleasant
i
told
him
to
be
silent
i
had
laid
out
etiennette
needle
case
and
also
a
little
box
in
which
i
had
placed
lise
rose
mattia
wanted
to
open
this
box
but
i
would
not
let
him
i
put
it
back
in
my
bag
without
even
lifting
the
lid
if
you
want
to
please
me
i
said
you
will
never
touch
this
box
it
a
present
i
promise
never
to
touch
it
he
said
solemnly
since
i
had
again
donned
my
sheepskin
and
my
harp
there
was
one
thing
which
caused
me
serious
thought
that
was
my
trousers
it
seemed
to
me
that
an
artist
ought
not
to
wear
long
trousers
to
appear
in
public
an
artist
should
have
short
trousers
with
stockings
coming
over
them
laced
over
and
over
with
colored
ribbons
trousers
were
all
right
for
a
gardener
but
now
i
was
an
artist
yes
i
must
wear
knickers
i
quickly
took
the
scissors
from
etiennette
while
i
arrange
my
trousers
i
said
to
mattia
you
ought
to
show
me
how
you
play
the
violin
oh
i
like
to
he
began
to
play
while
i
boldly
stuck
the
points
of
my
scissors
into
my
trousers
a
little
above
the
knee
i
commenced
to
cut
the
cloth
yet
however
they
were
a
beautiful
pair
of
gray
cloth
trousers
with
vest
and
coat
to
match
and
i
had
been
so
proud
of
them
when
acquin
had
given
them
to
me
but
i
did
not
consider
that
i
was
spoiling
them
by
shortening
them
quite
the
contrary
at
first
i
scarcely
listened
to
mattia
i
was
too
busy
cutting
my
trousers
but
soon
i
stopped
manipulating
the
scissors
and
became
all
ears
mattia
played
almost
as
well
as
vitalis
who
taught
you
the
violin
i
asked
clapping
my
hands
no
one
i
studied
alone
has
any
one
explained
to
you
anything
about
music
no
i
play
just
what
i
hear
i
teach
you
i
will
you
know
everything
then
well
so
i
ought
to
if
i
the
director
i
wanted
to
show
mattia
that
i
also
was
a
musician
i
took
my
harp
and
wishing
to
impress
him
i
sang
the
famous
canzonette
then
as
it
should
be
between
artists
he
complimented
me
he
had
great
talent
we
were
worthy
of
each
other
i
buckled
my
knapsack
and
mattia
in
turn
hoisted
it
on
his
shoulders
we
had
to
stop
at
the
first
village
to
give
a
performance
it
was
to
be
the
first
appearance
of
remi
company
teach
me
your
song
said
mattia
we
sing
it
together
and
soon
be
able
to
accompany
you
on
the
violin
that
be
pretty
certainly
that
would
be
pretty
and
the
distinguished
audience
would
have
a
heart
of
stone
if
they
were
not
generous
in
their
offerings
at
the
first
village
that
we
came
to
we
had
to
pass
before
a
large
farm
gate
looking
in
we
saw
a
crowd
of
people
dressed
up
in
their
best
some
of
them
carried
bouquets
tied
with
satin
streamers
it
was
a
wedding
i
thought
that
perhaps
these
people
might
like
a
little
music
and
dance
so
i
went
into
the
farmyard
and
suggested
it
to
the
first
person
that
i
met
this
was
a
big
looking
man
with
a
red
face
he
wore
a
tall
white
collar
and
a
prince
albert
coat
he
did
not
reply
to
my
question
but
turning
to
the
guests
he
put
his
two
fingers
in
his
mouth
and
gave
such
a
shrill
whistle
that
it
frightened
capi
say
you
all
he
cried
what
about
a
little
music
the
musicians
have
arrived
oh
music
music
came
the
chorus
take
your
places
for
the
quadrilles
the
dancers
soon
gathered
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
mattia
and
i
took
our
places
up
in
a
wagon
can
you
play
the
quadrilles
i
whispered
anxiously
yes
he
struck
a
few
notes
on
his
violin
by
luck
i
knew
the
air
we
were
saved
although
mattia
and
i
had
never
played
together
we
did
not
do
badly
it
is
true
the
people
had
not
much
ear
for
music
can
one
of
you
play
the
cornet
asked
the
big
man
with
the
red
face
i
can
said
mattia
but
i
have
the
instrument
with
me
i
go
and
find
one
the
violin
pretty
but
it
squeaky
i
found
that
day
that
mattia
could
play
everything
we
played
until
night
without
stopping
it
did
not
matter
for
me
but
poor
mattia
was
very
weak
from
time
to
time
i
saw
him
turn
pale
as
though
he
felt
ill
yet
he
continued
to
play
blowing
with
all
his
might
fortunately
i
was
not
the
only
one
who
saw
that
he
was
ill
the
bride
remarked
it
also
that
enough
she
said
that
little
chap
is
tired
out
now
all
hands
to
your
pockets
for
the
musicians
i
threw
my
cap
to
capi
who
caught
it
in
his
jaws
give
your
offerings
to
our
secretary
if
you
please
i
said
they
applauded
and
were
delighted
at
the
manner
in
which
capi
bowed
they
gave
generously
the
husband
was
the
last
and
he
dropped
a
five
franc
piece
in
the
cap
the
cap
was
full
of
silver
coins
what
a
fortune
we
were
invited
to
supper
and
they
gave
us
a
place
to
sleep
in
the
hay
loft
the
next
day
when
we
left
this
hospitable
farm
we
had
a
capital
of
francs
i
owe
this
to
you
mattia
i
said
after
we
had
counted
it
i
could
not
have
made
an
orchestra
all
alone
with
francs
in
our
pockets
we
were
rich
when
we
reached
corbeil
i
could
very
well
afford
to
buy
a
few
things
that
i
considered
indispensable
first
a
cornet
which
would
cost
three
francs
at
a
shop
then
some
red
ribbons
for
our
stockings
and
lastly
another
knapsack
it
would
be
easier
to
carry
a
small
bag
all
the
time
than
a
heavy
one
in
turns
a
boss
like
you
who
does
beat
one
is
too
good
said
mattia
laughing
happily
from
time
to
time
our
prosperous
state
of
affairs
made
me
decide
to
set
out
for
mother
barberin
as
soon
as
possible
i
could
take
her
a
present
i
was
rich
now
there
was
something
that
more
than
anything
else
would
make
her
happy
not
only
now
but
in
her
old
age
a
cow
that
would
replace
poor
rousette
how
happy
she
would
be
if
i
gave
her
a
cow
and
how
proud
i
should
be
before
arriving
at
chavanon
i
would
buy
a
cow
and
mattia
would
lead
it
by
a
rope
right
into
mother
barberin
yard
mattia
would
say
to
her
here
is
a
cow
i
brought
you
a
cow
she
would
say
you
made
a
mistake
my
boy
and
she
would
sigh
no
i
have
mattia
would
answer
you
mother
barberin
of
chevanon
are
you
well
the
prince
like
in
fairy
tales
has
sent
you
this
as
a
present
what
prince
then
i
would
appear
and
take
her
in
my
arms
and
after
we
had
hugged
each
other
we
would
make
some
pancakes
and
apple
fritters
which
would
be
eaten
by
the
three
of
us
and
not
by
barberin
as
on
that
shrove
tuesday
when
he
had
returned
to
upset
our
frying
pan
and
put
our
butter
in
his
onion
soup
what
a
beautiful
dream
but
to
realize
it
we
must
first
buy
the
cow
how
much
would
a
cow
cost
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
a
great
deal
probably
but
still
i
did
not
want
a
very
big
cow
because
the
fatter
the
cow
the
higher
the
price
and
then
the
bigger
the
cow
the
more
nourishment
it
would
require
and
i
did
not
want
my
present
to
be
a
source
of
inconvenience
to
mother
barberin
the
essential
for
the
moment
was
to
find
out
the
price
of
cows
or
rather
of
a
cow
of
the
kind
that
i
wanted
fortunately
that
was
not
difficult
for
we
often
met
many
farmers
and
cattle
dealers
at
the
different
villages
where
we
stopped
i
put
the
question
to
the
first
i
met
at
the
inn
that
day
he
burst
out
laughing
and
gave
a
bang
on
the
table
then
he
called
the
landlady
this
little
musician
wants
to
know
how
much
a
cow
costs
not
a
very
large
one
but
a
very
healthy
one
that
give
plenty
of
milk
every
one
laughed
i
did
care
though
yes
she
must
give
good
milk
and
not
eat
too
much
i
said
and
she
must
mind
being
led
along
the
lanes
by
a
halter
when
he
had
had
his
laugh
he
was
quite
willing
to
enter
a
discussion
with
me
and
to
take
the
matter
seriously
he
had
just
the
very
thing
a
nice
cow
which
gave
delicious
milk
real
cream
and
she
hardly
ate
anything
if
i
would
put
down
fifty
√©cus
the
cow
was
mine
although
i
had
had
trouble
in
making
him
talk
at
first
once
he
commenced
it
was
difficult
to
stop
him
finally
we
were
able
to
retire
for
the
night
and
i
dreamed
of
all
i
had
learned
from
him
fifty
√©cus
that
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
francs
i
had
nothing
like
that
great
sum
perhaps
if
our
luck
still
continued
i
could
if
i
saved
sou
by
sou
get
together
the
hundred
and
fifty
francs
but
it
would
take
time
in
that
case
we
should
have
to
go
first
of
all
to
varses
and
see
benny
and
give
all
the
performances
that
we
could
on
our
way
and
then
on
our
return
we
would
have
the
money
and
we
would
go
to
chavanon
and
act
the
fairy
tale
the
prince
cow
i
told
mattia
of
my
plan
and
he
raised
no
objections
chapter
xxi
meeting
old
friends
it
took
us
nearly
three
months
to
do
this
journey
but
when
at
last
we
reached
the
outskirts
of
varses
we
found
that
we
had
indeed
employed
our
time
well
in
my
leather
purse
i
now
had
one
hundred
and
francs
we
were
only
short
of
francs
to
buy
mother
cow
mattia
was
almost
as
pleased
as
i
and
he
was
very
proud
that
he
had
contributed
his
part
to
such
a
sum
his
part
was
great
for
i
am
sure
that
without
him
capi
and
i
could
not
have
collected
anything
like
the
sum
of
one
hundred
and
francs
from
varses
to
chavanon
we
could
easily
gain
the
francs
that
we
were
short
it
was
three
in
the
afternoon
when
we
arrived
at
varses
and
a
radiant
sun
shone
in
the
clear
sky
but
the
nearer
we
got
to
the
town
the
darker
became
the
atmosphere
between
the
sky
and
the
earth
hung
a
cloud
of
smoke
i
knew
that
alexix
uncle
was
a
miner
at
varses
but
i
did
not
know
whether
he
lived
in
the
town
itself
or
outside
i
simply
knew
that
he
worked
in
a
mine
called
the
truy√®re
upon
entering
the
town
i
asked
where
this
mine
was
situated
and
i
was
directed
to
the
left
bank
of
the
river
divonne
in
a
little
dale
traversed
by
a
ravine
after
which
the
mine
had
been
named
this
dale
is
as
unattractive
as
the
town
at
the
office
they
told
us
where
uncle
gaspard
alexix
uncle
lived
it
was
in
a
winding
street
which
led
from
the
hill
to
the
river
at
a
little
distance
from
the
mine
when
we
reached
the
house
a
woman
who
was
leaning
up
against
the
door
talking
to
two
or
three
neighbors
told
me
that
gaspard
the
miner
would
not
be
back
until
six
what
do
you
want
of
him
she
asked
i
want
to
see
alexix
his
nephew
oh
you
remi
she
said
alexix
has
spoken
of
you
he
been
expecting
you
who
that
boy
she
pointed
to
mattia
he
my
friend
this
woman
was
alexix
aunt
i
thought
she
would
ask
us
to
go
in
and
rest
for
we
were
very
dusty
and
tired
but
she
simply
repeated
that
if
i
would
return
at
six
i
could
see
alexix
who
was
then
at
the
mine
i
had
not
the
heart
to
ask
for
what
was
not
offered
i
thanked
her
and
went
into
the
town
to
find
a
baker
to
get
something
to
eat
i
was
ashamed
of
this
reception
for
i
felt
that
mattia
would
wonder
what
it
meant
why
should
we
have
tramped
so
many
miles
for
this
it
seemed
to
me
that
mattia
would
have
a
poor
idea
of
my
friends
and
that
when
i
should
speak
to
him
of
lise
he
would
not
listen
to
me
with
the
same
interest
and
i
wanted
him
very
much
to
like
lise
the
cold
welcome
that
the
aunt
had
given
us
did
not
encourage
me
to
return
to
the
house
so
at
a
little
before
six
mattia
capi
and
i
went
to
the
entrance
of
the
mine
to
wait
for
alexix
we
had
been
told
by
which
gallery
the
miners
would
come
out
and
a
little
after
six
we
began
to
see
in
the
dark
shadows
of
the
gallery
some
tiny
lights
which
gradually
became
larger
the
miners
with
lamp
in
hand
were
coming
up
into
the
day
their
work
finished
they
came
on
slowly
with
heavy
gait
as
though
they
suffered
in
the
knees
i
understood
how
this
was
later
when
i
myself
had
gone
over
the
staircases
and
ladders
which
led
to
the
last
level
their
faces
were
as
black
as
chimney
sweeps
their
clothes
and
hats
covered
with
coal
dust
each
man
entered
the
lamplighter
cabin
and
hung
up
his
lamp
on
a
nail
although
keeping
a
careful
lookout
i
did
not
see
alexix
until
he
had
rushed
up
to
me
i
should
have
let
him
pass
without
recognizing
him
it
was
hard
to
recognize
in
this
boy
black
from
head
to
foot
the
chum
who
had
raced
with
me
down
the
garden
paths
in
his
clean
shirt
turned
up
to
the
elbows
and
his
collar
thrown
open
showing
his
white
skin
it
remi
he
cried
turning
to
a
man
of
about
forty
years
who
walked
near
him
and
who
had
a
kind
frank
face
like
acquin
this
was
not
surprising
considering
that
they
were
brothers
i
knew
that
this
was
uncle
gaspard
we
been
expecting
you
a
long
time
he
said
smiling
the
road
is
long
from
paris
to
varses
i
said
smiling
back
and
your
legs
are
short
he
retorted
laughing
capi
happy
at
seeing
alexix
expressed
his
joy
by
tugging
at
the
leg
of
his
trousers
with
all
his
might
during
this
time
i
explained
to
uncle
gaspard
that
mattia
was
my
friend
and
partner
and
that
he
played
the
cornet
better
than
any
one
and
there
monsieur
capi
said
uncle
gaspard
you
be
rested
so
you
can
entertain
us
for
it
sunday
alexix
says
that
that
dog
is
cleverer
than
a
schoolmaster
and
a
comedian
combined
as
much
as
i
felt
ill
at
ease
with
the
aunt
so
i
felt
at
ease
with
uncle
gaspard
now
you
two
boys
talk
together
he
said
cheerily
i
am
sure
that
you
have
a
lot
to
say
to
each
other
i
going
to
have
a
chat
with
this
young
man
who
plays
the
cornet
so
well
alexix
wanted
to
know
about
my
journey
and
i
wanted
to
know
about
his
work
we
were
so
busy
questioning
each
other
that
neither
of
us
waited
for
a
reply
when
we
arrived
at
the
house
uncle
gaspard
invited
us
to
supper
never
did
an
invitation
give
me
such
pleasure
for
i
had
wondered
as
we
walked
along
if
we
should
have
to
part
at
the
door
the
aunt
welcome
not
having
given
us
much
hope
here
remi
and
his
friend
said
the
father
entering
the
house
we
sat
down
to
supper
the
meal
did
not
last
long
for
the
aunt
who
was
a
gossiper
was
only
serving
delicatessen
that
evening
the
miner
ate
his
delicatessen
supper
without
a
word
of
complaint
he
was
an
easy
going
man
who
above
all
liked
peace
he
never
complained
if
he
had
a
remark
to
pass
it
was
said
in
a
quiet
gentle
way
the
supper
was
soon
over
uncle
gaspard
told
me
that
i
could
sleep
with
alexix
that
night
and
told
mattia
that
if
he
would
go
with
him
into
the
bakehouse
he
would
make
him
up
a
bed
there
that
evening
and
the
greater
part
of
the
night
alexix
and
i
spent
talking
everything
that
alexix
told
me
excited
me
strangely
i
had
always
wanted
to
go
down
in
a
mine
but
when
i
spoke
of
it
the
next
day
to
uncle
gaspard
he
told
me
that
he
could
not
possibly
take
me
down
as
only
those
who
worked
in
the
colliery
were
permitted
to
enter
if
you
want
to
be
a
miner
he
said
it
will
be
easy
it
not
worse
than
any
other
job
it
better
than
being
a
singer
on
the
streets
you
can
stay
here
with
alexix
we
get
a
job
for
mattia
also
but
not
in
playing
the
cornet
oh
no
i
had
no
intention
of
staying
at
varses
there
was
something
else
i
had
set
myself
to
do
i
was
about
to
leave
the
town
without
my
curiosity
being
satisfied
when
circumstances
came
about
in
which
i
learned
in
all
their
horror
the
dangers
to
which
the
miners
are
exposed
on
the
day
that
i
was
to
leave
varses
a
large
block
of
coal
fell
on
alexix
hand
and
almost
crushed
his
finger
for
several
days
he
was
obliged
to
give
the
hand
complete
rest
uncle
gaspard
was
in
despair
for
now
he
had
no
one
to
push
his
car
and
he
was
afraid
that
he
also
would
be
obliged
to
stay
at
home
and
he
could
ill
afford
to
do
this
why
ca
i
take
his
place
i
asked
when
he
returned
home
after
hunting
in
vain
for
a
boy
i
was
afraid
the
car
would
be
too
heavy
for
you
my
boy
he
said
but
if
you
be
willing
to
try
you
help
me
a
mighty
lot
it
is
hard
to
find
a
boy
for
a
few
days
only
and
while
you
are
down
in
the
mine
i
go
off
with
capi
and
earn
the
rest
of
the
money
for
the
cow
cried
mattia
the
three
months
that
we
had
lived
together
in
the
open
air
had
completely
changed
mattia
he
was
no
longer
the
poor
pale
boy
whom
i
had
found
leaning
up
against
the
church
much
less
was
he
the
monster
whom
i
had
seen
for
the
first
time
in
garofoli
attic
looking
after
the
soup
and
from
time
to
time
clasping
his
hands
over
his
poor
aching
head
mattia
never
had
a
headache
now
he
was
never
unhappy
neither
was
he
thin
or
sad
the
beautiful
sun
and
the
fresh
air
had
given
him
health
and
spirits
on
our
tramps
he
was
always
laughing
and
in
a
good
humor
seeing
the
best
side
of
everything
amused
at
anything
happy
at
nothing
how
lonely
i
would
have
been
without
him
we
were
so
utterly
different
in
character
perhaps
that
was
why
we
got
on
so
well
together
he
had
a
sweet
sunny
disposition
a
little
careless
and
with
a
delightful
way
of
overcoming
difficulties
we
might
well
have
quarreled
when
i
was
teaching
him
to
read
and
giving
his
lessons
in
music
for
i
had
not
the
patience
of
a
schoolmaster
i
was
often
unjust
to
him
but
never
once
did
he
show
signs
of
anger
it
was
understood
that
while
i
was
down
in
the
mine
mattia
and
capi
were
to
go
off
into
the
suburbs
and
give
musical
and
dramatic
performances
and
thereby
increase
our
fortune
capi
to
whom
i
explained
this
arrangement
appeared
to
understand
and
accordingly
barked
approval
the
next
day
following
close
in
uncle
gaspard
footsteps
i
went
down
into
the
deep
dark
mine
he
bade
me
be
very
cautious
but
there
was
no
need
for
his
warning
it
is
not
without
a
certain
fear
and
anxiety
that
one
leaves
the
light
of
day
to
enter
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
when
far
down
the
gallery
i
instinctively
looked
back
but
the
daylight
at
the
end
of
the
long
black
tube
looked
like
a
white
globe
like
the
moon
in
a
dark
starless
sky
soon
the
big
black
pit
yawned
before
us
down
below
i
could
see
the
swaying
lamps
of
other
miners
as
they
descended
the
ladder
we
reached
the
stall
where
uncle
gaspard
worked
on
the
second
level
all
those
employed
in
pushing
the
cars
were
young
boys
with
the
exception
of
one
whom
they
called
professor
he
was
an
old
man
who
in
his
younger
days
had
worked
as
a
carpenter
in
the
mine
but
through
an
accident
which
had
crushed
his
fingers
had
been
obliged
to
give
up
his
trade
i
was
soon
to
learn
what
it
meant
to
be
a
miner
chapter
xxii
imprisoned
in
a
mine
a
few
days
later
while
pushing
my
car
along
the
rails
i
heard
a
terrible
roaring
the
noise
came
from
all
sides
my
first
feeling
was
one
of
terror
and
i
thought
only
of
saving
myself
but
i
had
so
often
been
laughed
at
for
my
fears
that
shame
made
me
stay
i
wondered
if
it
could
be
an
explosion
suddenly
hundreds
of
rats
raced
past
me
fleeing
like
a
regiment
of
cavalry
then
i
heard
a
strange
sound
against
the
earth
and
the
walls
of
the
gallery
and
the
noise
of
running
water
i
raced
back
to
uncle
gaspard
water
coming
into
the
mine
i
cried
do
be
silly
oh
listen
there
was
something
in
my
manner
that
forced
uncle
gaspard
to
stop
his
work
and
listen
the
noise
was
now
louder
and
more
sinister
race
for
your
life
the
mine
flooded
he
shouted
professor
professor
i
screamed
we
rushed
down
the
gallery
the
old
man
joined
us
the
water
was
rising
rapidly
you
go
first
said
the
old
man
when
we
reached
the
ladder
we
were
not
in
a
position
to
show
politeness
uncle
gaspard
went
first
i
followed
then
came
the
professor
before
we
had
reached
the
top
of
the
ladder
a
rush
of
water
fell
extinguishing
our
lamps
hold
on
cried
uncle
gaspard
we
clung
to
the
rungs
but
some
men
who
were
below
us
were
thrown
off
the
fall
of
water
had
turned
into
a
veritable
avalanche
we
were
on
the
first
landing
water
was
here
also
we
had
no
lights
for
our
lamps
had
been
put
out
i
afraid
we
are
lost
said
the
professor
quietly
say
your
prayers
my
boy
at
this
moment
seven
or
eight
miners
with
lamps
came
running
in
our
direction
trying
to
reach
the
ladder
the
water
was
now
rushing
through
the
mine
in
a
regular
torrent
dragging
in
its
mad
course
pieces
of
wood
whirling
them
round
like
feathers
we
must
make
for
an
airshaft
boys
said
the
professor
that
is
the
only
place
where
we
might
find
refuge
give
me
a
lamp
usually
no
one
took
any
notice
of
the
old
man
when
he
spoke
unless
it
was
to
make
fun
of
him
but
the
strongest
man
there
had
lost
his
nerve
and
it
was
the
voice
of
the
old
man
whom
they
had
mocked
so
often
that
they
were
now
ready
to
obey
a
lamp
was
handed
to
him
he
seized
it
and
dragged
me
along
with
him
taking
the
lead
he
more
than
any
man
knew
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
mine
the
water
was
up
to
my
waist
the
professor
led
us
to
the
nearest
airshaft
two
miners
refused
to
enter
saying
that
we
were
throwing
ourselves
into
a
blind
alley
they
continued
along
the
gallery
and
we
never
saw
them
again
then
came
a
deafening
noise
a
rush
of
water
a
splintering
of
wood
explosions
of
compressed
air
a
dreadful
roaring
which
terrified
us
it
the
deluge
shrieked
one
the
end
of
the
world
oh
god
have
mercy
on
us
hearing
the
men
shrieking
their
cries
of
despair
the
professor
said
calmly
but
in
a
voice
to
which
all
listened
courage
boys
now
as
we
are
going
to
stay
here
for
a
while
we
must
get
to
work
we
ca
stay
long
huddled
together
like
this
let
us
scoop
out
a
hollow
in
the
shale
so
as
to
have
a
place
to
rest
upon
his
words
calmed
the
men
with
hands
and
lamphooks
they
began
to
dig
into
the
soil
the
task
was
difficult
for
the
airshaft
in
which
we
had
taken
refuge
was
on
a
considerable
slope
and
very
slippery
and
we
knew
that
it
meant
death
if
we
made
a
false
step
a
resting
place
was
made
and
we
were
able
to
stop
and
take
note
of
each
other
we
were
seven
the
professor
uncle
gaspard
three
miners
pages
comperou
and
bergounhoux
and
a
car
pusher
named
carrory
and
myself
the
noise
in
the
mine
continued
with
the
same
violence
there
are
no
words
with
which
to
describe
the
horrible
uproar
it
seemed
to
us
that
our
last
hour
had
come
mad
with
fear
we
gazed
at
one
another
questioningly
the
evil
genius
of
the
mine
taking
his
revenge
cried
one
it
a
hole
broke
through
from
the
river
above
i
ventured
to
say
the
professor
said
nothing
he
merely
shrugged
his
shoulder
as
though
he
could
have
argued
out
the
matter
in
full
day
under
the
shade
of
a
mulberry
tree
eating
an
onion
it
all
folly
about
the
genius
of
the
mine
he
said
at
last
the
mine
is
flooded
that
a
sure
thing
but
what
has
caused
the
flood
we
down
here
ca
tell
well
if
you
do
know
what
it
is
shut
up
cried
the
men
now
that
we
were
dry
and
the
water
was
not
touching
us
no
one
wanted
to
listen
to
the
old
man
the
authority
which
his
coolness
in
danger
had
gained
for
him
was
already
lost
we
sha
die
from
drowning
he
said
at
last
quietly
look
at
the
flame
in
your
lamps
how
short
it
is
now
do
be
a
wizard
what
do
you
mean
speak
out
i
am
not
trying
to
be
a
wizard
but
we
sha
be
drowned
we
are
in
a
bell
of
air
and
it
is
this
compressed
air
which
stops
the
water
from
rising
this
airshaft
without
an
outlet
is
doing
for
us
what
the
diving
bell
does
for
the
diver
the
air
has
accumulated
in
the
shaft
and
now
resists
the
water
which
ebbs
back
it
is
the
foul
air
that
we
have
to
fear
the
water
is
not
rising
a
foot
now
the
mine
must
be
full
where
marius
cried
pages
thinking
of
his
only
son
who
worked
on
the
third
level
oh
marius
marius
he
shrieked
there
was
no
reply
not
even
an
echo
his
voice
did
not
go
beyond
our
bell
was
marius
saved
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
drowned
that
would
be
too
horrible
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
at
least
had
gone
down
into
the
mine
how
many
had
been
able
to
get
out
by
the
shafts
or
had
found
a
refuge
like
ourselves
there
was
now
utter
silence
in
the
mine
at
our
feet
the
water
was
quite
still
not
a
ripple
not
a
gurgle
the
mine
was
full
this
heavy
silence
impenetrable
and
deathly
was
more
stupefying
than
the
frightful
uproar
that
we
had
heard
when
the
water
first
rushed
in
we
were
in
a
tomb
buried
alive
more
than
a
hundred
feet
under
ground
we
all
seemed
to
feel
the
awfulness
of
our
situation
even
the
professor
seemed
crushed
down
suddenly
i
felt
some
warm
drops
fall
on
my
hand
it
was
carrory
he
was
crying
silently
then
came
a
voice
shrieking
marius
my
boy
marius
the
air
was
heavy
to
breathe
i
felt
suffocated
there
was
a
buzzing
in
my
ears
i
was
afraid
afraid
of
the
water
the
darkness
and
death
the
silence
oppressed
me
the
uneven
jagged
walls
of
our
place
of
refuge
seemed
as
though
they
would
fall
and
crush
me
beneath
their
weight
should
i
never
see
lise
again
and
arthur
and
milligan
and
dear
old
mattia
would
they
be
able
to
make
little
lise
understand
that
i
was
dead
and
that
i
could
not
bring
her
news
from
her
brothers
and
sister
and
mother
barberin
poor
mother
barberin
in
my
opinion
they
are
not
trying
to
rescue
us
said
uncle
gaspard
breaking
the
silence
at
last
we
ca
hear
a
sound
how
can
you
think
that
of
your
comrades
cried
the
professor
hotly
you
know
well
enough
that
in
every
mine
accident
the
miners
have
never
deserted
one
another
and
that
twenty
men
one
hundred
men
would
sooner
be
killed
than
leave
a
comrade
without
assistance
you
know
that
well
enough
that
is
true
murmured
uncle
gaspard
make
no
error
they
are
trying
their
hardest
to
reach
us
they
have
two
ways
one
is
to
bore
a
tunnel
to
us
down
here
the
other
is
to
drain
off
the
water
the
men
began
a
vague
discussion
as
to
how
long
it
would
take
to
accomplish
this
task
all
realized
that
we
should
have
to
remain
at
least
eight
days
in
our
tomb
eight
days
i
had
heard
of
miners
being
imprisoned
for
days
but
that
was
in
a
story
and
this
was
reality
when
i
was
able
to
fully
grasp
what
this
meant
i
paid
no
heed
to
the
talk
around
me
i
was
stunned
again
there
was
silence
all
were
plunged
in
thought
how
long
we
remained
so
i
can
not
tell
but
suddenly
there
was
a
cry
the
pumps
are
at
work
this
was
said
with
one
voice
for
the
sounds
that
had
just
reached
our
ears
had
seemed
to
touch
us
by
an
electric
current
and
we
all
rose
up
we
should
be
saved
carrory
took
my
hand
and
squeezed
it
you
a
good
boy
he
said
no
you
are
i
replied
but
he
insisted
energetically
that
i
was
a
good
boy
his
manner
was
as
though
he
were
intoxicated
and
so
he
was
he
was
intoxicated
with
hope
but
before
we
were
to
see
the
beautiful
sun
again
and
hear
the
birds
in
the
trees
we
were
to
pass
through
long
cruel
days
of
agony
and
wonder
in
anguish
if
we
should
ever
see
the
light
of
day
again
we
were
all
very
thirsty
pages
wanted
to
go
down
and
get
some
water
but
the
professor
advised
him
to
stay
where
he
was
he
feared
that
the
d√©bris
which
we
had
piled
up
would
give
way
beneath
his
weight
and
that
he
would
fall
into
the
water
remi
is
lighter
give
him
a
boot
and
he
can
go
down
and
get
water
for
us
all
he
said
carrory
boot
was
handed
to
me
and
i
prepared
to
slip
down
the
bank
wait
a
minute
said
the
professor
let
me
give
you
a
hand
oh
but
it
all
right
professor
i
replied
if
i
fall
in
i
can
swim
do
as
i
tell
you
he
insisted
take
my
hand
in
his
effort
to
help
me
he
either
miscalculated
his
step
or
the
coal
gave
way
beneath
him
for
he
slid
over
the
inclined
plane
and
fell
head
first
into
the
black
waters
the
lamp
which
he
held
to
light
me
rolled
after
him
and
disappeared
also
instantly
we
were
plunged
in
darkness
for
we
were
burning
only
one
light
there
was
a
simultaneous
cry
from
every
man
fortunately
i
was
already
in
position
to
get
to
the
water
letting
myself
slide
down
on
my
back
i
slipped
into
the
water
after
the
old
man
in
my
wanderings
with
vitalis
i
had
learned
to
swim
and
to
dive
i
was
as
much
at
ease
in
the
water
as
on
land
but
how
could
i
direct
my
course
in
this
black
hole
i
had
not
thought
of
that
when
i
let
myself
slip
i
only
thought
that
the
old
man
would
be
drowned
where
should
i
look
on
which
side
should
i
swim
i
was
wondering
when
i
felt
a
firm
hand
seize
my
shoulder
i
was
dragged
beneath
the
water
kicking
out
my
foot
sharply
i
rose
to
the
surface
the
hand
was
still
grasping
my
shoulder
hold
on
professor
i
cried
keep
your
head
up
and
we
saved
saved
neither
one
nor
the
other
was
saved
for
i
did
not
know
which
way
to
swim
speak
out
you
fellows
i
cried
remi
where
are
you
it
was
uncle
gaspard
voice
it
came
from
the
left
light
the
lamp
there
was
instantly
a
light
i
had
only
to
stretch
out
my
hand
to
touch
the
bank
with
one
hand
i
clutched
at
a
block
of
coal
and
drew
up
the
old
man
it
was
high
time
for
he
had
already
swallowed
a
great
deal
of
water
and
was
partly
unconscious
i
kept
his
head
well
above
water
and
he
soon
came
round
our
companions
took
hold
of
him
and
pulled
him
up
while
i
hoisted
him
from
behind
i
clambered
up
in
my
turn
after
this
disagreeable
accident
which
for
the
moment
had
caused
us
some
distraction
we
again
fell
into
fits
of
depression
and
despair
and
with
them
came
thoughts
of
approaching
death
i
became
very
drowsy
the
place
was
not
favorable
for
sleep
i
could
easily
have
rolled
into
the
water
then
the
professor
seeing
the
danger
i
ran
took
my
head
upon
his
chest
and
put
his
arm
around
my
body
he
did
not
hold
me
very
tight
but
enough
to
keep
me
from
falling
and
i
laid
there
like
a
child
on
his
mother
knee
when
i
moved
half
awake
he
merely
changed
the
position
of
his
arm
that
had
grown
stiff
then
sat
motionless
again
sleep
little
chap
he
whispered
leaning
over
me
do
be
afraid
i
got
you
remi
and
i
slept
without
fear
for
i
knew
very
well
he
would
not
let
go
of
me
we
had
no
idea
of
time
we
did
not
know
if
we
had
been
there
two
days
or
six
days
opinions
differed
we
spoke
no
more
of
our
deliverance
death
was
in
our
hearts
say
what
you
like
professor
cried
bergounhoux
you
have
calculated
how
long
it
will
take
them
to
pump
out
the
water
but
they
never
be
in
time
to
save
us
we
shall
die
of
hunger
or
suffocation
have
patience
answered
the
professor
i
know
how
long
we
can
live
without
food
and
i
have
made
my
calculations
they
will
do
it
in
time
at
this
moment
big
comperou
burnt
into
sobs
the
good
lord
is
punishing
me
he
cried
and
i
repent
i
repent
if
i
get
out
of
here
i
swear
to
atone
for
the
wrong
i
have
done
and
if
i
do
get
out
you
boys
will
make
amends
for
me
you
know
rouquette
who
was
sentenced
for
five
years
for
stealing
a
watch
from
mother
vidal
i
was
the
thief
i
took
it
its
under
my
bed
now
oh
throw
him
in
the
water
cried
both
pages
and
bergounhoux
do
you
want
to
appear
then
before
the
lord
with
a
crime
on
your
conscience
cried
the
professor
let
him
repent
i
repent
i
repent
wailed
comperou
more
feebly
than
a
child
in
spite
of
his
great
strength
to
the
water
to
the
water
cried
pages
and
bergounhoux
trying
to
get
at
the
sinner
who
was
crouching
behind
the
professor
if
you
want
to
throw
him
in
the
water
you
throw
me
with
him
no
no
finally
they
said
they
would
not
push
him
in
the
water
but
upon
one
condition
he
was
to
be
left
in
a
corner
and
no
one
was
to
speak
to
him
or
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
yes
that
what
he
deserves
said
the
professor
that
only
fair
after
the
professor
words
which
seemed
like
a
judgment
condemning
comperou
we
all
huddled
together
and
got
as
far
away
from
him
as
possible
leaving
a
space
between
us
and
the
unfortunate
man
for
several
hours
i
should
think
he
sat
there
grief
stricken
his
lips
moving
every
now
and
again
to
say
i
repent
i
repent
and
then
pages
and
bergounhoux
would
cry
out
it
too
late
it
too
late
you
repent
because
you
afraid
now
you
should
have
repented
six
months
ago
a
year
ago
he
gasped
painfully
but
still
repeated
i
repent
i
repent
he
was
in
a
high
fever
all
his
body
shook
and
his
teeth
were
chattering
i
thirsty
he
said
give
me
the
boot
there
was
no
more
water
in
the
boot
i
got
up
to
go
and
fetch
some
but
pages
who
had
seen
me
called
to
me
to
stop
and
at
the
same
moment
uncle
gaspard
pulled
me
by
the
arm
we
swore
we
would
pay
no
attention
to
him
he
said
for
some
minutes
comperou
repeated
that
he
was
thirsty
seeing
that
we
would
not
give
him
anything
to
drink
he
rose
up
to
go
to
the
water
himself
he
drag
down
the
rubbish
cried
pages
let
him
at
least
have
his
freedom
said
the
professor
he
had
seen
me
go
down
by
letting
myself
slide
on
my
back
he
wanted
to
do
the
same
but
i
was
light
whilst
he
was
heavy
scarcely
was
he
on
his
back
than
the
coal
gave
way
beneath
him
and
with
his
legs
stretched
out
and
his
arms
striking
into
space
he
slipped
into
the
black
hole
the
water
splashed
up
to
where
we
were
i
leaned
forward
ready
to
go
down
but
uncle
gaspard
and
the
professor
each
grasped
me
by
the
arm
half
dead
and
trembling
with
horror
i
drew
myself
back
time
passed
the
professor
was
the
only
one
who
could
speak
with
courage
but
our
depression
finally
made
his
spirits
droop
our
hunger
had
become
so
great
that
we
ate
the
rotten
wood
about
us
carrory
who
was
like
an
animal
was
the
most
famished
of
all
he
had
cut
up
his
other
boot
and
was
continually
chewing
the
pieces
of
leather
seeing
what
hunger
had
led
us
to
i
must
confess
that
i
began
to
have
terrible
fears
vitalis
had
often
told
me
tales
of
men
who
had
been
shipwrecked
in
one
story
a
crew
who
had
been
shipwrecked
on
a
desert
island
where
there
was
nothing
to
eat
had
eaten
the
ship
boy
seeing
my
companions
in
such
a
famished
state
i
wondered
if
that
fate
was
to
be
mine
i
knew
that
the
professor
and
uncle
gaspard
would
never
eat
me
but
of
pages
bergounhoux
and
carrory
especially
carrory
with
his
great
white
teeth
which
he
dug
into
the
leather
of
his
boot
i
was
not
quite
so
sure
once
when
i
was
half
asleep
i
had
been
surprised
to
hear
the
professor
speak
in
almost
a
whisper
as
though
he
was
dreaming
he
was
talking
of
the
clouds
the
wind
and
the
sun
then
pages
and
bergounhoux
began
to
chatter
with
him
in
a
foolish
manner
neither
waited
for
the
other
to
reply
uncle
gaspard
seemed
hardly
to
notice
how
foolish
they
were
were
they
all
gone
mad
what
was
to
be
done
suddenly
i
thought
i
would
light
a
lamp
to
economize
we
had
decided
only
to
have
a
light
when
it
was
absolutely
necessary
when
they
saw
the
light
they
apparently
regained
their
senses
i
went
to
get
some
water
for
them
the
waters
were
going
down
after
a
time
they
began
to
talk
strangely
again
my
own
thoughts
were
vague
and
wild
and
for
long
hours
and
perhaps
days
we
laid
there
chattering
to
one
another
foolishly
after
a
time
we
became
quieter
and
bergounhoux
said
that
before
dying
we
should
put
down
our
last
wishes
we
lit
a
lamp
and
bergounhoux
wrote
for
us
all
and
we
each
signed
the
paper
i
gave
my
dog
and
harp
to
mattia
and
i
expressed
a
wish
for
alexix
to
go
to
lise
and
kiss
her
for
me
and
give
her
the
dried
rose
that
was
in
my
vest
pocket
dear
little
lise
after
some
time
i
slipped
down
the
bank
again
and
saw
that
the
waters
were
lowering
considerably
i
hurried
back
to
my
companions
and
told
them
that
now
i
could
swim
to
the
ladders
and
tell
our
rescuers
in
what
part
of
the
mine
we
had
taken
refuge
the
professor
forbade
me
to
go
but
i
insisted
go
on
remi
and
i
give
you
my
watch
cried
uncle
gaspard
the
professor
thought
for
a
moment
then
took
my
hand
do
as
you
think
boy
he
said
you
have
a
heart
i
think
that
you
are
attempting
the
impossible
but
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
what
was
thought
impossible
has
been
successful
kiss
us
boy
i
kissed
the
professor
and
uncle
gaspard
and
then
having
thrown
off
my
clothes
i
went
into
the
water
you
keep
shouting
all
the
while
i
said
before
taking
the
plunge
your
voices
will
guide
me
i
wondered
if
the
space
under
the
roof
of
the
gallery
was
big
enough
for
me
to
move
freely
that
was
the
question
after
some
strokes
i
found
that
i
could
swim
if
i
went
gently
i
knew
that
there
was
a
meeting
of
galleries
not
far
away
but
i
had
to
be
cautious
for
if
i
made
a
mistake
in
the
course
i
should
lose
my
way
the
roof
and
the
walls
of
the
gallery
were
not
enough
to
guide
me
on
the
ground
there
was
a
surer
guide
the
rails
if
i
followed
them
i
should
be
sure
to
find
the
ladders
from
time
to
time
i
let
my
feet
go
down
and
having
touched
the
iron
rails
i
rose
up
again
gently
with
the
voices
of
my
companions
behind
me
and
the
rails
under
my
feet
i
was
not
lost
as
the
voices
became
less
distinct
the
noise
of
the
pumps
increased
i
was
advancing
thank
god
i
should
soon
see
the
light
of
day
going
straight
down
the
middle
of
the
gallery
i
had
only
to
turn
to
the
right
to
touch
the
rail
i
went
on
a
little
farther
then
dived
again
to
touch
the
rail
it
was
not
there
i
went
from
side
to
side
of
the
gallery
but
there
was
no
rail
i
had
made
a
mistake
the
voices
of
my
companions
only
reached
me
in
the
faintest
murmur
i
took
in
a
deep
breath
then
plunged
again
but
with
no
more
success
there
were
no
rails
i
had
taken
the
wrong
level
without
knowing
i
must
have
turned
back
but
how
was
it
the
others
were
not
shouting
if
they
were
i
could
not
hear
them
i
was
distracted
for
i
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
in
this
cold
black
water
then
suddenly
i
heard
the
sounds
of
voices
again
and
i
knew
which
way
to
turn
after
having
taken
a
dozen
strokes
back
i
turned
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
but
only
found
the
walls
where
were
the
rails
i
was
sure
now
that
i
was
in
the
right
level
then
i
suddenly
realized
that
the
railroad
had
been
carried
away
by
the
rush
of
waters
and
that
i
had
no
guide
under
these
circumstances
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
carry
out
my
plan
and
i
was
forced
to
turn
back
i
swam
back
quickly
to
our
place
of
refuge
the
voices
guiding
me
as
i
approached
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
companions
voices
were
more
assured
as
though
they
felt
stronger
i
was
soon
at
the
entrance
of
the
shaft
i
hallooed
to
them
come
back
come
back
shouted
the
professor
i
could
not
find
the
way
i
called
out
never
mind
the
tunnel
is
nearly
finished
they
hear
our
cries
and
we
can
hear
theirs
we
shall
soon
speak
i
climbed
quickly
up
to
our
landing
and
listened
we
could
hear
the
blows
from
the
picks
and
the
cries
of
those
who
worked
for
our
freedom
came
to
us
feebly
but
yet
very
distinct
after
the
first
rush
of
joy
i
realized
that
i
was
frozen
as
there
were
no
warm
clothes
to
give
me
they
buried
me
up
to
the
neck
in
coal
dust
and
uncle
gaspard
and
the
professor
huddled
up
against
me
to
keep
me
warm
we
knew
now
that
our
rescuers
would
soon
reach
us
through
the
tunnel
and
by
the
water
but
these
last
hours
of
our
imprisonment
were
the
hardest
to
bear
the
blows
from
the
picks
continued
and
the
pumping
had
not
stopped
for
one
moment
strange
the
nearer
we
reached
the
hour
of
our
deliverance
the
weaker
we
grew
i
was
lying
in
the
coal
dust
trembling
but
i
was
not
cold
we
were
unable
to
speak
suddenly
there
was
a
noise
in
the
waters
of
the
gallery
and
turning
my
head
i
saw
a
great
light
coming
towards
us
the
engineer
was
at
the
head
of
several
men
he
was
the
first
to
climb
up
to
us
he
had
me
in
his
arms
before
i
could
say
a
word
it
was
time
for
my
heart
was
failing
me
yet
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
being
carried
away
and
i
was
wrapped
up
in
a
blanket
after
our
rescuers
had
waded
through
the
water
in
the
gallery
i
closed
my
eyes
when
i
opened
them
again
it
was
daylight
we
were
in
the
open
air
at
the
same
time
something
jumped
on
me
it
was
capi
with
a
bound
he
had
sprung
upon
me
as
i
laid
in
the
engineer
arms
he
licked
my
face
again
and
again
then
my
hand
was
taken
i
felt
a
kiss
and
heard
a
weak
voice
murmuring
remi
oh
remi
it
was
mattia
i
smiled
at
him
then
i
glanced
round
a
mass
of
people
were
crowded
together
in
two
straight
rows
leaving
a
passage
down
the
center
it
was
a
silent
crowd
for
they
had
been
requested
not
to
excite
us
by
their
cries
but
their
looks
spoke
for
their
lips
in
the
first
row
i
seemed
to
see
some
white
surplices
and
gilt
ornaments
which
shone
in
the
sun
they
were
the
priests
who
had
come
to
the
entrance
of
the
mine
to
offer
prayers
for
our
deliverance
when
we
were
brought
out
they
went
down
on
their
knees
in
the
dust
twenty
arms
were
stretched
out
to
take
me
but
the
engineer
would
not
give
me
up
he
carried
me
to
the
offices
where
beds
had
been
prepared
to
receive
us
two
days
later
i
was
walking
down
the
village
street
followed
by
mattia
alexix
and
capi
there
were
some
who
came
and
shook
me
by
the
hands
with
tears
in
their
eyes
and
there
were
others
who
turned
away
their
heads
these
were
in
mourning
and
they
asked
themselves
bitterly
why
this
orphan
child
had
been
saved
when
their
fathers
and
sons
were
still
in
the
mine
ghastly
corpses
drifting
hither
and
thither
in
the
dark
waters
chapter
xxiii
once
more
upon
the
way
i
had
made
some
friends
in
the
mine
such
terrible
experiences
born
in
common
unites
one
uncle
gaspard
and
the
professor
in
particular
had
grown
very
fond
of
me
and
although
the
engineer
had
not
shared
our
captivity
he
had
become
attached
to
me
like
one
is
to
a
child
that
one
has
snatched
from
death
he
invited
me
to
his
house
i
had
to
tell
his
daughter
all
that
had
happened
to
us
in
the
mine
every
one
wanted
to
keep
me
at
varses
the
engineer
told
me
that
if
i
wished
he
would
find
me
a
position
in
the
offices
uncle
gaspard
said
he
would
get
me
a
permanent
job
in
the
mine
he
seemed
to
think
it
quite
natural
that
i
should
return
to
the
colliery
he
himself
was
soon
going
down
again
with
that
indifference
that
men
show
who
are
accustomed
to
brave
danger
each
day
i
had
no
wish
to
go
back
a
mine
was
very
interesting
and
i
was
very
pleased
that
i
had
seen
one
but
i
had
not
the
slightest
desire
to
return
i
preferred
to
have
the
sky
over
my
head
even
a
sky
full
of
snow
the
life
suited
me
better
and
so
i
told
them
every
one
was
surprised
especially
the
professor
carrory
when
he
met
me
called
me
a
chicken
during
the
time
that
they
were
all
trying
to
persuade
me
to
stay
at
varses
mattia
became
very
preoccupied
and
thoughtful
i
questioned
him
but
he
always
answered
that
nothing
was
the
matter
it
was
not
until
i
told
him
that
we
were
starting
off
on
our
tramps
in
three
days
time
that
he
admitted
the
cause
of
his
sadness
oh
i
thought
that
you
would
stay
and
that
you
would
leave
me
he
said
i
gave
him
a
good
slap
so
as
to
teach
him
not
to
doubt
me
mattia
was
quite
able
to
look
after
himself
now
while
i
was
down
in
the
mine
he
had
earned
eighteen
francs
he
was
very
proud
when
he
handed
me
this
large
sum
for
with
the
hundred
and
that
we
already
had
this
made
a
total
of
one
hundred
and
francs
we
only
wanted
four
francs
more
to
be
able
to
buy
the
prince
cow
forward
march
children
with
baggage
strapped
on
our
back
we
set
forth
on
the
road
with
capi
barking
and
rolling
in
the
dust
for
joy
mattia
suggested
that
we
get
a
little
more
money
before
buying
the
cow
the
more
money
we
had
the
better
the
cow
and
the
better
the
cow
the
more
pleased
mother
barberin
would
be
while
tramping
from
paris
to
varses
i
had
begun
to
give
mattia
reading
lessons
and
elementary
music
lessons
i
continued
these
lessons
now
either
i
was
not
a
good
teacher
which
was
quite
possible
or
mattia
was
not
a
good
pupil
which
also
was
quite
possible
the
lessons
were
not
a
success
often
i
got
angry
and
shutting
the
book
with
a
bang
told
him
that
he
was
a
thickhead
that
true
he
said
smiling
my
head
is
only
soft
when
it
banged
garofoli
found
out
that
how
could
one
keep
angry
at
this
reply
i
laughed
and
we
went
on
with
the
lessons
but
with
music
from
the
beginning
he
made
astonishing
progress
in
the
end
he
so
confused
me
with
his
questions
that
i
was
obliged
to
confess
that
i
could
not
teach
him
any
more
this
confession
mortified
me
exceedingly
i
had
been
a
very
proud
professor
and
it
was
humiliating
for
me
not
to
be
able
to
answer
my
pupil
questions
and
he
did
not
spare
me
oh
no
i
like
to
go
and
take
one
lesson
from
a
real
master
he
said
only
just
one
and
i
ask
him
all
the
questions
that
i
want
answered
why
did
you
take
this
lesson
from
a
real
master
while
i
was
in
the
mine
because
i
did
want
to
take
what
he
would
charge
out
of
your
money
i
was
hurt
when
mattia
had
spoken
thus
of
a
master
but
my
absurd
vanity
could
not
hold
out
against
his
last
words
you
a
good
boy
i
said
my
money
is
your
money
you
earn
it
also
and
more
than
i
very
often
you
can
take
as
many
lessons
as
you
like
and
i
take
them
with
you
the
master
the
master
that
we
required
was
not
a
villager
but
an
a
great
such
as
might
be
found
only
in
important
towns
consulting
our
map
we
found
that
the
next
big
town
was
mendes
it
was
already
night
when
we
reached
mendes
and
as
we
were
tired
out
we
decided
that
we
could
not
take
a
lesson
that
evening
we
asked
the
landlady
of
the
inn
where
we
could
find
a
good
music
master
she
said
that
she
was
very
surprised
that
we
asked
such
a
question
surely
we
knew
monsieur
espinassous
we
come
from
a
distance
i
said
you
must
have
come
from
a
very
great
distance
then
from
italy
replied
mattia
then
she
was
no
longer
astonished
and
she
admitted
that
coming
from
so
far
then
we
might
not
have
heard
of
espinassous
is
this
professor
very
busy
i
asked
fearing
that
such
a
celebrated
musician
might
not
care
to
give
just
one
lesson
to
two
little
urchins
like
ourselves
oh
yes
i
should
say
he
is
busy
how
could
he
be
do
you
think
that
he
would
receive
us
morning
sure
he
receives
every
one
when
they
have
money
in
their
pockets
naturally
we
understood
that
of
course
before
going
to
sleep
we
discussed
all
the
questions
that
we
intended
asking
the
celebrated
professor
the
next
day
mattia
was
quite
elated
at
our
luck
in
finding
just
the
kind
of
musician
we
wanted
next
morning
we
took
our
instruments
mattia
his
violin
and
i
my
harp
and
set
out
to
find
espinassous
we
did
not
take
capi
because
we
thought
that
it
would
not
do
to
call
on
such
a
celebrated
person
with
a
dog
we
tied
him
up
in
the
inn
stables
when
we
reached
the
house
which
our
landlady
indicated
was
the
professor
we
thought
that
we
must
have
made
a
mistake
for
before
the
house
two
little
brass
plaques
were
swinging
which
was
certainly
not
the
sign
of
a
music
professor
the
place
bore
every
appearance
of
a
barber
shop
turning
to
a
man
who
was
passing
we
asked
him
if
he
could
direct
us
to
house
there
it
is
he
said
pointing
to
the
barber
shop
after
all
why
should
not
a
professor
live
with
a
barber
we
entered
the
shop
was
partitioned
off
into
two
equal
parts
on
the
right
were
brushes
combs
jars
of
cream
and
barbers
chairs
on
the
left
hanging
on
the
walls
and
on
the
shelves
were
various
instruments
violins
cornets
trombones
etc
monsieur
espinassous
inquired
mattia
fluttering
like
a
bird
the
dapper
little
man
who
was
in
the
act
of
shaving
a
man
replied
i
am
monsieur
espinassous
i
glanced
at
mattia
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
barber
musician
was
not
the
man
we
were
looking
for
that
it
would
be
wasting
good
money
to
consult
him
but
mattia
instead
of
understanding
my
look
sat
down
in
a
chair
with
a
deliberate
air
will
you
cut
my
hair
after
you
have
shaved
that
gentleman
he
asked
certainly
young
man
and
i
give
you
a
shave
also
if
you
like
thanks
replied
mattia
i
was
abashed
at
his
assurance
he
looked
at
me
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
to
ask
me
to
wait
before
getting
annoyed
when
the
man
was
shaved
espinassous
with
towel
over
his
arm
prepared
to
cut
mattia
hair
monsieur
said
mattia
while
the
barber
tied
the
sheet
round
his
neck
my
friend
and
i
had
an
argument
and
as
we
know
that
you
are
a
celebrated
musician
we
thought
that
you
would
give
us
your
advice
and
settle
the
matter
for
us
what
is
it
young
man
now
i
knew
what
mattia
was
driving
at
first
of
all
he
wanted
to
see
if
this
was
capable
of
replying
to
our
questions
if
so
he
intended
to
get
a
music
lesson
at
the
price
of
a
hair
cut
all
the
while
mattia
was
having
his
hair
cut
he
asked
questions
the
was
highly
amused
but
answered
each
question
put
to
him
quickly
and
with
pleasure
when
we
were
ready
to
leave
he
asked
mattia
to
play
something
on
his
violin
mattia
played
a
piece
and
you
do
know
a
note
of
music
cried
the
barber
clapping
his
hands
and
looking
affectionately
at
mattia
as
though
he
had
known
and
loved
him
all
his
life
it
is
wonderful
mattia
took
a
clarionette
from
amongst
the
instruments
and
played
on
it
then
a
cornet
why
the
youngster
a
prodigy
cried
espinassous
in
rapture
if
you
will
stay
here
with
me
i
make
you
a
great
musician
in
the
mornings
you
shall
learn
to
shave
my
customers
and
the
rest
of
the
day
you
shall
study
music
do
think
because
i
a
barber
i
do
know
music
one
has
to
live
i
looked
at
mattia
what
was
he
going
to
reply
was
i
to
lose
my
friend
my
chum
my
brother
think
for
your
own
good
mattia
i
said
but
my
voice
shook
leave
my
friend
he
cried
linking
his
arm
in
mine
that
i
never
could
but
thank
you
all
the
same
monsieur
espinassous
insisted
and
told
mattia
that
later
they
would
find
the
means
to
send
him
to
the
conservatoire
in
paris
because
he
would
surely
be
a
great
musician
leave
remi
never
well
then
replied
the
barber
sorrowfully
let
me
give
you
a
book
and
you
can
learn
what
you
do
not
know
from
that
he
took
a
book
out
of
one
of
the
drawers
entitled
the
theory
of
music
it
was
old
and
torn
but
what
did
that
matter
taking
a
pen
he
sat
down
and
wrote
on
the
first
page
to
a
child
who
when
he
becomes
celebrated
will
remember
the
barber
of
mendes
i
do
know
if
there
were
any
other
professors
of
music
at
mendes
but
that
was
the
only
one
we
knew
and
we
never
forgot
him
chapter
xxiv
friendship
that
is
true
i
loved
mattia
when
we
arrived
at
mendes
but
when
we
left
the
town
i
loved
him
even
more
i
could
not
tell
him
before
the
barber
how
i
felt
when
he
cried
out
leave
my
friend
i
took
his
hand
and
squeezed
it
as
we
tramped
along
it
till
death
doth
us
part
now
mattia
i
said
i
knew
that
long
ago
he
replied
smiling
at
me
with
his
great
dark
eyes
we
heard
that
there
was
going
to
be
an
important
cattle
fair
at
ussel
so
we
decided
to
go
there
and
buy
the
cow
it
was
on
our
way
to
chavanon
we
played
in
every
town
and
village
on
the
road
and
by
the
time
we
had
reached
ussel
we
had
collected
two
hundred
and
forty
francs
we
had
to
economize
in
every
possible
manner
to
save
this
sum
but
mattia
was
just
as
interested
and
eager
to
buy
the
animal
as
i
he
wanted
it
to
be
white
i
wanted
brown
in
memory
of
poor
rousette
we
both
agreed
however
that
she
must
be
very
gentle
and
give
plenty
of
milk
as
neither
of
us
knew
by
what
signs
one
could
tell
a
good
cow
we
decided
to
employ
the
services
of
a
veterinarian
we
had
heard
many
stories
of
late
how
people
had
been
deceived
when
buying
a
cow
and
we
did
not
want
to
run
any
risk
it
would
be
an
expense
to
employ
a
veterinarian
but
that
could
not
be
helped
we
had
heard
of
one
man
who
had
bought
an
animal
for
a
very
low
price
and
when
he
had
got
her
home
he
found
that
she
had
a
false
tail
another
man
so
we
were
told
had
bought
a
cow
which
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
healthy
state
and
had
every
appearance
of
giving
plenty
of
milk
but
she
only
gave
two
glasses
of
milk
in
hours
by
a
little
trick
practiced
by
the
cattle
dealer
the
animal
was
made
to
look
as
though
she
had
plenty
of
milk
mattia
said
that
as
far
as
the
false
tail
went
we
had
nothing
to
fear
for
he
would
hang
onto
the
tail
of
every
cow
with
all
his
might
before
we
entered
into
any
discussion
with
the
seller
when
i
told
him
that
if
it
were
a
real
tail
he
would
probably
get
a
kick
in
the
stomach
or
on
his
head
his
imagination
cooled
somewhat
it
was
several
years
since
i
had
arrived
at
ussel
with
vitalis
where
he
had
bought
me
my
first
pair
of
shoes
with
nails
alas
out
of
the
six
of
us
who
started
capi
and
i
were
the
only
ones
left
as
soon
as
we
got
to
the
town
after
having
left
our
baggage
at
the
same
inn
where
i
had
stayed
before
with
vitalis
and
the
dogs
we
began
to
look
about
for
a
veterinarian
we
found
one
and
he
seemed
very
amused
when
we
described
to
him
the
kind
of
a
cow
we
wanted
and
asked
if
he
would
come
and
buy
it
for
us
but
what
in
the
world
do
you
two
boys
want
with
a
cow
and
have
you
got
the
money
he
demanded
we
told
him
how
much
money
we
had
and
how
we
got
it
and
that
we
were
going
to
give
a
present
a
surprise
to
mother
barberin
of
chavanon
who
had
looked
after
me
when
i
was
a
baby
he
showed
a
very
kindly
interest
then
and
promised
to
meet
us
the
next
morning
at
the
fair
at
seven
when
we
asked
him
his
charges
he
refused
flatly
to
accept
anything
he
sent
us
off
laughing
and
told
us
to
be
at
the
fair
on
time
the
next
day
at
daybreak
the
town
was
full
of
excitement
from
our
room
at
the
inn
we
could
hear
the
carts
and
wagons
rolling
over
the
cobblestones
in
the
street
below
and
the
cows
bellowing
the
sheep
bleating
the
farmers
shouting
at
their
animals
and
joking
with
each
other
we
jumped
into
our
clothes
and
arrived
at
the
fair
at
six
for
we
wanted
to
make
a
selection
before
the
veterinarian
arrived
what
beautiful
cows
they
were
all
colors
and
all
sizes
some
fat
some
thin
and
some
with
their
calves
there
were
also
horses
and
great
fat
pigs
scooping
holes
in
the
ground
and
little
plump
sucking
pigs
squealing
as
though
they
were
being
skinned
alive
but
we
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
the
cows
they
stood
very
quiet
placidly
chewing
they
permitted
us
to
make
a
thorough
examination
merely
blinking
their
eyelids
after
one
hour
inspection
we
had
found
seventeen
that
pleased
us
this
for
one
quality
that
for
another
a
third
because
she
was
red
two
because
they
were
white
which
of
course
brought
up
a
discussion
between
mattia
and
myself
the
veterinarian
arrived
we
showed
him
the
cows
we
liked
i
think
this
one
ought
to
be
a
good
one
mattia
said
pointing
to
a
white
animal
i
think
that
is
a
better
one
i
said
indicating
a
red
one
the
veterinarian
stopped
the
argument
we
had
begun
by
ignoring
both
and
passing
on
to
a
third
one
this
one
had
slim
legs
red
coat
with
brown
ears
and
cheeks
eyes
bordered
with
black
and
a
whitish
circle
around
her
muzzle
this
is
just
the
one
you
want
said
the
veterinarian
it
was
a
beauty
mattia
and
i
now
saw
that
this
was
the
best
the
veterinarian
asked
a
heavy
looking
peasant
who
held
the
cow
by
a
rope
how
much
he
wanted
for
it
three
hundred
francs
he
replied
our
mouths
dropped
three
hundred
francs
i
made
a
sign
to
the
veterinarian
that
we
must
pass
on
to
another
he
made
another
sign
that
he
would
drive
a
bargain
then
a
lively
discussion
commenced
between
the
veterinarian
and
the
peasant
our
bidder
went
up
to
the
peasant
came
down
to
when
they
reached
this
sum
the
veterinarian
began
to
examine
the
cow
more
critically
she
had
weak
legs
her
neck
was
too
short
her
horns
too
long
she
had
any
lungs
and
her
teats
were
not
well
formed
no
she
certainly
would
not
give
much
milk
the
peasant
said
that
as
we
knew
so
much
about
cows
he
would
let
us
have
her
for
francs
because
he
felt
sure
she
would
be
in
good
hands
thereupon
we
began
to
get
scared
for
both
mattia
and
i
thought
that
it
must
be
a
poor
cow
then
let
us
go
and
see
some
others
i
suggested
touching
the
veterinarian
arm
hearing
this
the
man
came
down
ten
francs
then
little
by
little
he
came
down
to
francs
but
he
stopped
there
the
veterinarian
had
nudged
me
and
given
me
to
understand
that
he
was
not
serious
in
saying
what
he
did
about
the
cow
that
it
was
an
excellent
animal
but
then
francs
was
a
large
sum
for
us
during
this
time
mattia
had
gone
behind
her
and
pulled
a
long
wisp
of
hair
from
her
tail
and
the
animal
had
given
him
a
kick
that
decided
me
all
right
francs
i
said
thinking
the
matter
was
settled
i
held
out
my
hand
to
take
the
rope
have
you
brought
a
halter
asked
the
man
i
selling
my
cow
not
the
halter
he
said
that
as
we
were
friends
he
would
let
me
have
the
halter
for
sixty
sous
we
needed
a
halter
so
i
parted
with
the
sixty
sous
calculating
that
we
should
now
have
but
twenty
sous
left
i
counted
out
the
two
hundred
and
thirteen
francs
then
again
i
stretched
out
my
hand
have
you
got
a
rope
inquired
the
man
i
sold
you
the
halter
but
i
have
sold
you
the
rope
the
rope
cost
us
our
last
twenty
sous
the
cow
was
finally
handed
over
to
us
but
we
had
not
a
sou
left
to
buy
food
for
the
animal
nor
for
ourselves
after
warmly
thanking
the
veterinarian
for
his
kindness
we
shook
hands
and
said
to
him
and
went
back
to
the
inn
where
we
tied
our
cow
up
in
the
stable
as
it
was
a
very
busy
day
in
the
town
on
account
of
the
fair
and
people
from
all
parts
had
come
in
mattia
and
i
thought
that
it
would
be
better
for
each
to
go
his
own
way
and
see
what
we
could
make
in
the
evening
mattia
brought
back
four
francs
and
i
three
francs
fifty
centimes
with
seven
francs
fifty
we
felt
that
we
were
again
rich
we
persuaded
the
kitchen
maid
to
milk
our
cow
and
we
had
the
milk
for
supper
never
had
we
tasted
anything
so
good
we
were
so
enthusiastic
about
the
quality
of
the
milk
that
we
went
into
the
stable
as
soon
as
we
had
finished
to
embrace
our
treasure
the
cow
evidently
appreciated
this
caress
for
she
licked
our
faces
to
show
her
appreciation
to
understand
the
pleasure
that
we
felt
at
kissing
our
cow
and
to
be
kissed
by
her
it
must
be
remembered
that
neither
mattia
nor
i
had
been
overburdened
with
caresses
our
fate
had
not
been
that
of
the
petted
and
pampered
children
who
are
obliged
to
defend
themselves
against
too
many
kisses
the
next
morning
we
rose
with
the
sun
and
started
for
chavanon
how
grateful
i
was
to
mattia
for
the
help
he
had
given
me
without
him
i
never
could
have
collected
such
a
big
sum
i
wanted
to
give
him
the
pleasure
of
leading
the
cow
and
he
was
very
proud
indeed
to
pull
her
by
the
rope
while
i
walked
behind
she
looked
very
fine
she
walked
along
slowly
swaying
a
little
holding
herself
like
an
animal
that
is
aware
of
her
value
i
did
not
want
to
tire
her
out
so
i
decided
not
to
get
to
chavanon
that
evening
late
better
i
thought
get
there
early
in
the
morning
that
is
what
we
intended
to
do
this
is
what
happened
i
intended
to
stay
the
night
in
the
village
where
i
had
spent
my
first
night
with
vitalis
when
capi
seeing
me
so
unhappy
came
to
me
and
lay
down
beside
me
before
reaching
this
village
we
came
to
a
nice
green
spot
and
throwing
down
our
baggage
we
decided
to
rest
we
made
our
cow
go
down
into
a
ditch
at
first
i
wanted
to
hold
her
by
the
rope
but
she
seemed
very
docile
and
quite
accustomed
to
grazing
so
after
a
time
i
twisted
the
rope
around
her
horns
and
sat
down
near
her
to
eat
my
supper
naturally
we
had
finished
eating
long
before
she
had
so
after
having
admired
her
for
some
time
and
not
knowing
what
to
do
next
we
began
to
play
a
little
game
with
each
other
when
we
had
finished
our
game
she
was
still
eating
as
i
went
to
her
she
pulled
at
the
grass
sharply
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
was
still
hungry
wait
a
little
said
mattia
do
you
know
that
a
cow
can
eat
all
day
long
i
replied
well
wait
a
little
we
got
our
baggage
and
instruments
together
but
still
she
would
not
stop
eating
i
play
her
a
piece
on
the
cornet
said
mattia
who
found
it
difficult
to
keep
still
there
was
a
cow
at
gassot
circus
and
she
liked
music
he
commenced
to
play
a
lively
march
at
the
first
note
the
cow
lifted
up
her
head
then
suddenly
before
i
could
throw
myself
at
her
horns
to
catch
hold
of
the
rope
she
had
gone
off
at
a
gallop
we
raced
after
her
as
fast
as
we
could
calling
to
her
to
stop
i
shouted
to
capi
to
stop
her
now
one
can
not
be
endowed
with
every
talent
a
cattle
driver
dog
would
have
jumped
at
her
nose
but
capi
was
a
genius
so
he
jumped
at
her
legs
naturally
this
made
her
run
faster
she
raced
back
to
the
last
village
we
had
passed
through
as
the
road
was
straight
we
could
see
her
in
the
distance
and
we
saw
several
people
blocking
her
way
and
trying
to
catch
hold
of
her
we
slackened
our
speed
for
we
knew
now
that
we
should
not
lose
her
all
we
should
have
to
do
would
be
to
claim
her
from
the
good
people
who
had
stopped
her
going
farther
there
was
quite
a
crowd
gathered
round
her
when
we
arrived
on
the
scene
and
instead
of
giving
her
up
to
us
at
once
as
we
expected
they
would
they
asked
us
we
got
the
animal
and
we
got
her
they
insisted
that
we
had
stolen
her
and
that
she
was
running
back
to
her
owner
they
declared
that
we
ought
to
go
to
prison
until
the
truth
could
be
discovered
at
the
very
mention
of
the
word
prison
i
turned
pale
and
began
to
stammer
i
was
breathless
from
my
race
and
could
not
utter
a
word
at
this
moment
a
policeman
arrived
and
in
a
few
words
the
whole
affair
was
explained
to
him
as
it
did
not
seem
at
all
clear
he
decided
to
take
possession
of
the
cow
and
have
us
locked
up
until
we
could
prove
that
it
belonged
to
us
the
whole
village
seemed
to
be
in
the
procession
which
ran
behind
us
up
to
the
town
hall
which
was
also
the
station
house
the
mob
pushed
us
and
sneered
at
us
and
called
us
the
most
horrible
names
and
i
do
believe
that
if
the
officer
had
not
defended
us
they
would
have
lynched
us
as
though
we
were
criminals
of
the
deepest
dye
the
man
who
had
charge
of
the
town
hall
and
who
was
also
jailer
and
sheriff
did
not
want
to
admit
us
i
thought
what
a
kind
man
however
the
policeman
insisted
that
we
be
locked
up
and
the
jailer
finally
turned
the
big
key
in
a
door
and
pushed
us
into
the
prison
then
i
saw
why
he
had
made
some
difficulty
about
receiving
us
he
had
put
his
provision
of
onions
to
dry
in
this
prison
and
they
were
strewn
out
on
every
bench
he
heaped
them
all
together
in
a
corner
we
were
searched
our
money
matches
and
knives
taken
from
us
then
we
were
locked
up
for
the
night
i
wish
you
give
me
a
good
slap
said
mattia
miserably
when
we
were
alone
box
my
ears
or
do
something
to
me
i
was
as
big
a
fool
as
you
to
let
you
play
the
cornet
to
a
cow
i
replied
oh
i
feel
so
bad
about
it
he
said
brokenly
our
poor
cow
the
prince
cow
he
began
to
cry
then
i
tried
to
console
him
by
telling
him
that
our
situation
was
not
very
serious
we
would
prove
that
we
bought
the
cow
we
would
send
to
ussel
for
the
veterinarian
he
would
be
a
witness
but
if
they
say
we
stole
the
money
to
buy
it
he
said
we
ca
prove
that
we
earned
it
and
when
one
is
unfortunate
they
always
think
guilty
that
was
true
and
who
feed
her
went
on
mattia
dismally
oh
dear
i
did
hope
that
they
would
feed
our
poor
cow
and
what
are
we
going
to
say
when
they
question
us
in
the
morning
asked
mattia
tell
them
the
truth
and
then
they
hand
you
over
to
barberin
or
if
mother
barberin
is
alone
at
her
place
and
they
question
her
to
see
if
we
are
lying
we
ca
give
her
a
surprise
oh
dear
you
been
away
from
mother
barberin
for
a
long
time
how
do
you
know
if
she
is
dead
this
terrible
thought
had
never
occurred
to
me
and
yet
poor
vitalis
had
died
how
was
it
i
had
not
thought
that
i
might
lose
her
why
did
you
say
that
before
i
demanded
because
when
i
happy
i
do
have
those
ideas
i
have
been
so
happy
at
the
thought
of
offering
your
cow
to
mother
barberin
and
thinking
how
pleased
she
be
i
never
thought
before
that
she
might
be
dead
it
must
have
been
the
influence
of
this
dismal
room
for
we
could
only
see
the
darkest
side
of
everything
and
oh
cried
mattia
starting
up
and
throwing
out
his
arms
if
mother
barberin
is
dead
and
that
awful
barberin
is
alive
and
we
go
there
he
take
our
cow
and
keep
it
himself
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
an
old
gentleman
with
white
hair
came
into
our
prison
now
you
rogues
answer
this
gentleman
said
the
jailer
who
accompanied
him
that
all
right
that
all
right
said
the
gentleman
who
was
the
public
prosecutor
i
question
this
one
with
his
finger
he
indicated
me
you
take
charge
of
the
other
i
question
him
later
i
was
alone
with
the
prosecutor
fixing
me
with
his
eye
he
told
me
that
i
was
accused
of
having
stolen
a
cow
i
told
him
that
we
bought
the
animal
at
the
fair
at
ussel
and
i
named
the
veterinarian
who
had
assisted
us
in
the
purchase
that
will
be
verified
he
replied
and
now
what
made
you
buy
that
cow
i
told
him
that
i
was
offering
it
as
a
token
of
affection
to
my
foster
mother
her
name
he
demanded
madame
barberin
of
chavanon
i
replied
the
wife
of
a
mason
who
met
with
a
serious
accident
in
paris
a
few
years
ago
i
know
her
that
also
will
be
verified
oh
i
became
very
confused
seeing
my
embarrassment
the
prosecutor
pressed
me
with
questions
and
i
had
to
tell
him
that
if
he
made
inquiries
of
madame
barberin
our
cow
would
not
be
a
surprise
after
all
and
to
make
it
a
surprise
had
been
our
chief
object
but
in
the
midst
of
my
confusion
i
felt
a
great
satisfaction
to
know
that
mother
barberin
was
still
alive
and
in
the
course
of
the
questions
that
were
put
to
me
i
learned
that
barberin
had
gone
back
to
paris
some
time
ago
this
delighted
me
then
came
the
question
that
mattia
had
feared
but
how
did
you
get
all
the
money
to
buy
the
cow
i
explained
that
from
paris
to
varses
and
from
varses
to
ussel
we
had
collected
this
sum
sou
by
sou
but
what
were
you
doing
in
varses
he
asked
then
i
was
forced
to
tell
him
that
i
had
been
in
a
mine
accident
which
of
you
two
is
remi
he
asked
in
a
softened
voice
i
am
sir
i
replied
to
prove
that
you
tell
me
how
the
catastrophe
occurred
i
read
the
whole
account
of
it
in
the
papers
you
can
not
deceive
me
i
can
tell
if
you
really
are
remi
now
be
careful
i
could
see
that
he
was
feeling
very
lenient
towards
us
i
told
him
my
experience
in
the
mine
and
when
i
had
finished
my
story
i
thought
from
his
manner
which
was
almost
affectionate
that
he
would
give
us
our
freedom
at
once
but
instead
he
went
out
of
the
room
leaving
me
alone
a
prey
to
my
thoughts
after
some
time
he
returned
with
mattia
i
am
going
to
have
your
story
investigated
at
ussel
he
said
if
it
is
true
as
i
hope
it
is
you
will
be
free
and
our
cow
asked
mattia
anxiously
will
be
given
back
to
you
i
did
mean
that
replied
mattia
but
who
feed
her
who
milk
her
do
worry
youngster
said
the
prosecutor
mattia
smiled
contentedly
ah
then
if
they
milk
our
cow
he
asked
may
we
have
some
milk
for
supper
you
certainly
shall
as
soon
as
we
were
alone
i
told
mattia
the
great
news
that
had
almost
made
me
forget
that
we
were
locked
up
mother
barberin
is
alive
and
barberin
has
gone
to
paris
i
said
ah
then
the
prince
cow
will
make
a
triumphal
entry
he
commenced
to
dance
and
sing
with
joy
carried
away
by
his
gayety
i
caught
him
by
the
hands
and
capi
who
until
then
had
been
lying
in
a
corner
quiet
and
thoughtful
jumped
up
and
took
his
place
between
us
standing
up
on
his
hind
paws
we
then
threw
ourselves
into
such
a
wild
dance
that
the
jailer
rushed
in
to
see
what
was
the
matter
probably
afraid
for
his
onions
he
told
us
to
stop
but
he
spoke
very
differently
to
what
he
had
before
by
that
i
felt
that
we
were
not
in
a
very
serious
plight
i
had
further
proof
of
this
when
a
moment
later
he
came
in
carrying
a
big
bowl
of
milk
our
cow
milk
and
that
was
not
all
he
brought
a
large
piece
of
white
bread
and
some
cold
veal
which
he
said
the
prosecutor
had
sent
us
decidedly
prisons
were
not
so
bad
after
all
dinner
and
lodging
for
nothing
early
the
next
morning
the
prosecutor
came
in
with
our
friend
the
veterinarian
who
had
wanted
to
come
himself
to
see
that
we
got
our
freedom
before
we
left
the
prosecutor
handed
us
an
official
stamped
paper
see
i
giving
you
this
he
said
you
are
two
silly
boys
to
go
tramping
through
the
country
without
any
papers
i
have
asked
the
mayor
to
make
out
this
passport
for
you
this
is
all
you
will
need
to
protect
you
in
the
future
good
luck
boys
he
shook
hands
with
us
and
so
did
the
veterinarian
we
had
entered
the
village
miserably
but
we
left
in
triumph
leading
our
cow
by
the
rope
and
walking
with
heads
held
high
we
glanced
over
our
shoulders
at
the
villagers
who
were
standing
on
their
doorsteps
staring
at
us
i
did
not
want
to
tire
our
cow
but
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
chavanon
that
same
day
so
we
set
out
briskly
by
evening
we
had
almost
reached
my
old
home
mattia
had
never
tasted
pancakes
and
i
had
promised
him
some
as
soon
as
we
arrived
on
the
way
i
bought
one
pound
of
butter
two
pounds
of
flour
and
a
dozen
eggs
we
had
now
reached
the
spot
where
i
had
asked
vitalis
to
let
me
rest
so
that
i
could
look
down
on
mother
barberin
house
as
i
thought
for
the
last
time
take
the
rope
i
said
to
mattia
with
a
spring
i
was
on
the
parapet
nothing
had
been
changed
in
our
valley
it
looked
just
the
same
the
smoke
was
even
coming
out
of
the
chimney
as
it
came
towards
us
it
seemed
to
me
i
could
smell
oak
leaves
i
jumped
down
from
the
parapet
and
hugged
mattia
capi
sprang
up
on
me
and
i
squeezed
them
both
tight
come
let
get
there
as
quickly
as
possible
now
i
cried
what
a
pity
sighed
mattia
if
this
brute
only
loved
music
what
a
triumphal
entry
we
could
make
as
we
arrived
at
one
of
the
turns
in
the
road
we
saw
mother
barberin
come
out
of
her
cottage
and
go
off
in
the
direction
of
the
village
what
was
to
be
done
we
had
intended
to
spring
a
surprise
upon
her
we
should
have
to
think
of
something
else
knowing
that
the
door
was
always
on
the
latch
i
decided
to
go
straight
into
the
house
after
tying
our
cow
up
in
the
cowshed
we
found
the
shed
full
of
wood
now
so
we
heaped
it
up
in
a
corner
and
put
our
cow
in
poor
rousette
place
when
we
got
into
the
house
i
said
to
mattia
now
i
take
this
seat
by
the
fire
so
that
she
find
me
here
when
she
opens
the
gate
hear
it
creak
then
you
hide
yourself
with
capi
i
sat
down
in
the
very
spot
where
i
had
always
sat
on
a
winter
night
i
crouched
down
making
myself
look
as
small
as
possible
so
as
to
look
as
near
like
mother
barberin
little
remi
as
i
could
from
where
i
sat
i
could
watch
the
gate
i
looked
round
the
kitchen
nothing
was
changed
everything
was
in
the
same
place
a
pane
of
glass
that
i
had
broken
still
had
the
bit
of
paper
pasted
over
it
black
with
smoke
and
age
suddenly
i
saw
a
white
bonnet
the
gate
creaked
hide
yourself
quickly
i
said
to
mattia
i
made
myself
smaller
and
smaller
the
door
opened
and
mother
barberin
came
in
she
stared
at
me
who
is
there
she
asked
i
looked
at
her
without
answering
she
stared
back
at
me
suddenly
she
began
to
tremble
oh
lord
is
it
my
remi
she
murmured
i
jumped
up
and
caught
her
in
my
arms
mamma
my
boy
my
boy
was
all
that
she
could
say
as
she
laid
her
head
on
my
shoulder
some
minutes
passed
before
we
had
controlled
our
emotion
i
wiped
away
her
tears
why
how
you
grown
my
boy
she
cried
holding
me
at
arms
length
you
so
big
and
so
strong
oh
my
remi
a
stifled
snort
reminded
me
that
mattia
was
under
the
bed
i
called
him
he
crept
out
this
is
mattia
i
said
my
brother
oh
then
you
found
your
parents
she
cried
no
he
my
chum
but
just
like
a
brother
and
this
is
capi
i
added
after
she
had
greeted
mattia
come
and
salute
your
master
mother
capitano
capi
got
on
his
hind
paws
and
bowed
gravely
to
mother
barberin
she
laughed
heartily
her
tears
had
quite
vanished
mattia
made
me
a
sign
to
spring
our
surprise
let
go
and
see
how
the
garden
looks
i
said
i
have
kept
your
bit
just
as
you
arranged
it
she
said
for
i
knew
that
some
day
you
would
come
back
did
you
get
my
jerusalem
artichokes
ah
you
planted
them
to
surprise
me
you
always
liked
to
give
surprises
my
boy
the
moment
had
come
is
the
cowshed
just
the
same
since
poor
rousette
went
i
asked
oh
no
i
keep
my
wood
there
now
we
had
reached
the
shed
by
this
time
i
pushed
open
the
door
and
at
once
our
cow
who
was
hungry
began
to
bellow
a
cow
a
cow
in
my
cowshed
cried
mother
barberin
mattia
and
i
burst
out
laughing
it
a
surprise
i
cried
and
a
better
one
than
the
jerusalem
artichokes
she
looked
at
me
in
a
dazed
astonished
manner
yes
it
a
present
for
you
i
did
not
come
back
with
empty
hands
to
the
mamma
who
was
so
good
to
the
little
lost
boy
this
is
to
replace
rousette
mattia
and
i
bought
it
for
you
with
the
money
we
earned
oh
the
dear
boys
she
cried
kissing
us
both
she
now
went
inside
the
shed
to
examine
her
present
at
each
discovery
she
gave
a
shriek
of
delight
what
a
beautiful
cow
she
exclaimed
then
she
turned
round
suddenly
say
you
must
be
very
rich
now
i
should
say
so
laughed
mattia
we
got
sous
left
i
ran
to
the
house
to
fetch
the
milk
pail
and
while
in
the
house
i
arranged
the
butter
eggs
and
flour
in
a
display
on
the
table
then
ran
back
to
the
shed
how
delighted
she
was
when
she
had
a
pail
full
of
beautiful
frothy
milk
there
was
another
burst
of
delight
when
she
saw
the
things
on
the
table
ready
for
pancakes
which
i
told
her
we
were
dying
to
have
you
must
have
known
that
barberin
was
in
paris
then
she
said
i
explained
to
her
how
i
had
learned
so
i
will
tell
you
why
he
has
gone
she
said
looking
at
me
significantly
let
have
the
pancakes
first
i
said
do
let
talk
about
him
i
have
not
forgotten
how
he
sold
me
for
forty
francs
and
it
was
my
fear
of
him
the
fear
that
he
would
sell
me
again
that
kept
me
from
writing
to
tell
you
news
of
myself
oh
boy
i
thought
that
was
why
she
said
but
you
must
speak
unkindly
of
barberin
well
let
have
the
pancakes
now
i
said
hugging
her
we
all
set
briskly
to
prepare
the
ingredients
and
before
long
mattia
and
i
were
cramming
pancakes
down
our
throats
mattia
declared
that
he
had
never
tasted
anything
so
fine
as
soon
as
we
had
finished
one
we
held
out
our
plates
for
another
and
capi
came
in
for
his
share
mother
barberin
was
scandalized
that
we
should
give
a
dog
pancakes
but
we
explained
to
her
that
he
was
the
chief
actor
in
our
company
and
a
genius
and
that
he
was
treated
by
us
with
every
consideration
later
while
mattia
was
out
getting
some
wood
ready
for
the
next
morning
she
told
me
why
barberin
had
gone
to
paris
your
family
is
looking
for
you
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
what
barberin
has
gone
up
to
paris
about
he
looking
for
you
my
family
i
exclaimed
oh
have
i
a
family
of
my
own
speak
tell
all
mother
barberin
dear
mother
barberin
then
i
got
frightened
i
did
not
believe
that
my
family
was
looking
for
me
barberin
was
trying
to
find
me
so
that
he
could
sell
me
again
i
would
not
be
sold
i
told
my
fears
to
mother
barberin
but
she
said
no
my
family
was
looking
for
me
then
she
told
me
that
a
gentleman
came
to
the
house
who
spoke
with
a
foreign
accent
and
he
asked
barberin
what
had
become
of
the
little
baby
that
he
had
found
many
years
ago
in
paris
barberin
asked
him
what
business
that
was
of
his
this
answer
was
just
like
barberin
would
give
you
know
from
the
bakehouse
one
can
hear
everything
that
is
said
in
the
kitchen
said
mother
barberin
and
when
i
knew
that
they
were
talking
about
you
i
naturally
listened
i
got
nearer
and
then
i
trod
on
a
twig
of
wood
that
broke
we
not
alone
said
the
gentleman
to
barberin
we
are
that
only
my
wife
he
replied
the
gentleman
then
said
it
was
very
warm
in
the
kitchen
and
that
they
could
talk
better
outside
they
went
out
and
it
was
three
hours
later
when
barberin
came
back
alone
i
tried
to
make
him
tell
me
everything
but
the
only
thing
he
would
say
was
that
this
man
was
looking
for
you
but
that
he
was
not
your
father
and
that
he
had
given
him
one
hundred
francs
probably
had
more
since
from
this
and
the
fine
clothes
you
wore
when
he
found
you
we
think
your
parents
must
be
rich
then
jerome
said
he
had
to
go
off
to
paris
she
continued
to
find
the
musician
who
hired
you
this
musician
said
that
a
letter
sent
to
rue
mouffetard
to
a
man
named
garofoli
would
reach
him
and
have
you
heard
from
barberin
since
he
went
i
asked
surprised
that
he
had
sent
no
news
not
a
word
she
said
i
do
even
know
where
he
is
living
in
the
city
mattia
came
in
just
then
i
told
him
excitedly
that
i
had
a
family
and
that
my
parents
were
looking
for
me
he
said
he
was
pleased
for
me
but
he
did
not
seem
to
share
my
joy
and
enthusiasm
i
slept
little
that
night
mother
barberin
had
told
me
to
start
off
to
paris
and
find
barberin
at
once
and
not
delay
my
parent
joy
at
finding
me
i
had
hoped
that
i
could
spend
several
days
with
her
and
yet
i
felt
that
she
was
right
i
would
have
to
see
lise
before
going
that
could
be
managed
for
we
could
go
to
paris
by
way
of
the
canal
as
lise
uncle
kept
the
locks
and
lived
in
a
cottage
on
the
banks
we
could
stop
and
see
her
i
spent
that
day
with
mother
barberin
and
in
the
evening
we
discussed
what
i
would
do
for
her
when
i
was
rich
she
was
to
have
all
the
things
she
wanted
there
was
not
a
wish
of
hers
that
should
not
be
gratified
when
i
had
money
the
cow
that
you
have
given
me
in
your
poor
days
will
be
more
to
me
than
anything
you
can
give
me
when
you
rich
remi
she
said
fondly
the
next
day
after
bidding
dear
mother
barberin
a
loving
farewell
we
started
to
walk
along
the
banks
of
the
canal
mattia
was
very
thoughtful
i
knew
what
was
the
matter
he
was
sorry
that
i
had
rich
parents
as
though
that
would
make
any
difference
in
our
friendship
i
told
him
that
he
should
go
to
college
and
that
he
should
study
music
with
the
very
best
masters
but
he
shook
his
head
sadly
i
told
him
that
he
should
live
with
me
as
my
brother
and
that
my
parents
would
love
him
just
the
same
because
he
was
my
friend
but
still
he
shook
his
head
in
the
meantime
as
i
had
not
my
rich
parents
money
to
spend
we
had
to
play
in
all
the
villages
through
which
we
passed
to
get
money
for
our
food
and
i
also
wanted
to
make
some
money
to
buy
a
present
for
lise
mother
barberin
had
said
that
she
valued
the
cow
more
than
anything
i
could
give
her
when
i
became
rich
and
perhaps
i
thought
lise
would
feel
the
same
about
a
gift
i
wanted
to
give
her
a
doll
fortunately
a
doll
would
not
cost
so
much
as
a
cow
the
next
town
we
came
to
i
bought
her
a
lovely
doll
with
fair
hair
and
blue
eyes
walking
along
the
banks
of
the
canal
i
often
thought
of
milligan
and
arthur
and
their
beautiful
barge
and
wondered
if
we
should
meet
it
on
the
canal
but
we
never
saw
it
one
evening
we
could
see
in
the
distance
the
house
where
lise
lived
it
stood
amongst
the
trees
and
seemed
to
be
in
an
atmosphere
of
mist
we
could
see
the
window
lit
up
by
the
flames
from
a
big
fire
inside
the
reddish
light
fell
across
our
path
as
we
drew
nearer
my
heart
beat
quickly
i
could
see
them
inside
having
supper
the
door
and
the
window
were
shut
but
there
were
no
curtains
to
the
window
and
i
looked
in
and
saw
lise
sitting
beside
her
aunt
i
signed
to
mattia
and
capi
to
be
silent
and
then
taking
my
harp
from
my
shoulder
i
put
it
on
the
ground
oh
yes
whispered
mattia
a
serenade
what
a
fine
idea
no
not
you
i
play
alone
i
struck
the
first
notes
of
my
neapolitan
song
i
did
not
sing
for
i
did
not
want
my
voice
to
betray
me
as
i
played
i
looked
at
lise
she
raised
her
head
quickly
and
her
eyes
sparkled
then
i
commenced
to
sing
she
jumped
from
her
chair
and
ran
to
the
door
in
a
moment
she
was
in
my
arms
aunt
catherine
then
came
out
and
invited
us
in
to
supper
lise
quickly
placed
two
plates
on
the
table
if
you
do
mind
i
said
will
you
put
a
third
we
have
a
little
friend
with
us
and
i
pulled
out
the
doll
from
my
bag
and
placed
her
in
the
chair
next
to
lise
the
look
that
she
gave
me
i
shall
never
forget
chapter
xxv
mother
brothers
and
sisters
if
i
had
not
been
in
a
hurry
to
get
to
paris
i
should
have
stayed
a
long
time
with
lise
we
had
so
much
to
say
to
each
other
and
could
say
so
little
in
the
language
that
we
used
she
told
me
with
signs
how
good
her
uncle
and
aunt
had
been
to
her
and
what
beautiful
rides
she
had
in
the
barges
and
i
told
her
how
i
had
nearly
perished
in
the
mine
where
alexix
worked
and
that
my
family
were
looking
for
me
that
was
the
reason
that
i
was
hurrying
to
paris
and
that
was
why
it
had
been
impossible
for
me
to
go
and
see
etiennette
naturally
most
of
the
talk
was
about
my
family
my
rich
family
and
all
i
would
do
when
i
had
money
i
would
make
her
father
brothers
sisters
and
above
all
herself
happy
lise
unlike
mattia
was
delighted
she
quite
believed
that
if
one
had
money
one
ought
to
be
very
happy
because
would
not
her
father
have
been
happy
if
he
had
only
had
the
money
to
pay
his
debts
we
took
long
walks
all
three
of
us
lise
mattia
and
i
accompanied
by
the
doll
and
capi
i
was
very
happy
those
few
days
in
the
evening
we
sat
in
front
of
the
house
when
it
was
not
too
damp
and
before
the
fireplace
when
the
mist
was
thick
i
played
the
harp
and
mattia
played
his
violin
or
cornet
lise
preferred
the
harp
which
made
me
very
proud
when
the
time
came
and
we
had
to
separate
and
go
to
bed
i
played
and
sang
her
my
neapolitan
song
yet
we
had
to
part
and
go
on
our
way
i
told
her
that
i
would
come
back
for
her
soon
my
last
words
to
her
were
i
come
and
fetch
you
in
a
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
and
she
quite
believed
me
and
she
made
a
motion
as
though
she
were
cracking
a
whip
to
urge
on
the
horses
she
also
the
same
as
i
could
see
my
riches
and
my
horses
and
carriages
i
was
so
eager
to
get
to
paris
now
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
mattia
i
would
have
stopped
only
to
collect
what
was
absolutely
necessary
for
our
food
we
had
no
cow
to
buy
now
nor
doll
it
was
not
for
me
to
take
money
to
my
rich
parents
let
us
get
all
we
can
said
mattia
forcing
me
to
take
my
harp
for
we
do
know
if
we
shall
find
barberin
at
once
one
would
think
that
you
had
forgotten
that
night
when
you
were
dying
of
hunger
oh
i
have
i
said
lightly
but
we
sure
to
find
him
at
once
you
wait
yes
but
i
have
not
forgotten
how
i
leaned
up
against
the
church
that
day
when
you
found
me
ah
i
do
want
to
be
hungry
in
paris
we
dine
all
the
better
when
we
get
to
my
parents
i
replied
well
let
work
just
as
though
we
are
buying
another
cow
urged
mattia
this
was
very
wise
advice
but
i
must
admit
that
i
did
not
sing
with
the
same
spirit
to
get
the
money
to
buy
a
cow
for
mother
barberin
or
a
doll
for
lise
was
quite
a
different
matter
how
lazy
you
be
when
you
rich
said
mattia
the
nearer
we
got
to
paris
the
gayer
i
became
and
the
more
melancholy
grew
mattia
as
i
had
assured
him
that
we
should
not
be
parted
i
wondered
why
he
should
be
sad
now
finally
when
we
reached
the
gates
of
paris
he
told
me
how
great
was
his
fear
of
garofoli
and
that
if
he
saw
him
he
knew
that
he
would
take
him
again
you
know
how
afraid
you
are
of
barberin
so
you
can
imagine
how
i
fear
garofoli
if
he
out
of
prison
he
be
sure
to
catch
me
oh
my
poor
head
how
he
used
to
bang
it
and
then
he
will
part
us
of
course
like
to
have
you
as
one
of
his
pupils
but
he
could
not
force
you
to
stay
but
he
has
a
right
to
me
he
my
uncle
i
had
not
thought
of
garofoli
i
arranged
with
mattia
that
i
should
go
to
the
various
places
that
mother
barberin
had
mentioned
as
to
where
i
might
find
barberin
then
i
would
go
to
the
rue
mouffetard
and
after
that
he
should
meet
me
at
seven
outside
the
notre
dame
cathedral
we
parted
as
though
we
were
never
going
to
meet
again
mattia
went
in
one
direction
i
in
another
i
had
written
down
on
paper
the
names
of
the
places
where
barberin
had
lived
before
i
went
first
to
one
place
then
to
another
at
one
lodging
house
they
told
me
that
he
had
lived
there
four
years
ago
but
that
he
had
not
been
there
since
the
landlord
told
me
that
he
like
to
catch
the
rogue
for
he
owed
him
one
rent
i
grew
very
despondent
there
was
only
one
place
left
for
me
to
inquire
that
was
at
a
restaurant
the
man
who
kept
the
place
said
that
he
had
not
seen
him
for
a
very
long
time
but
one
of
the
customers
sitting
eating
at
a
table
called
out
that
he
had
been
living
at
the
hotel
du
cantal
of
late
before
going
to
the
hotel
du
cantal
i
went
to
garofoli
place
to
see
if
i
could
find
out
something
about
him
so
that
i
could
take
back
some
news
to
poor
mattia
when
i
reached
the
yard
i
saw
as
on
my
first
visit
the
same
old
man
hanging
up
dirty
rags
outside
the
door
has
garofoli
returned
i
asked
the
old
man
looked
at
me
without
replying
then
began
to
cough
i
could
see
that
he
would
not
tell
me
anything
unless
i
let
him
know
that
knew
all
about
garofoli
you
do
mean
to
say
he
is
still
in
prison
i
exclaimed
why
i
thought
he
got
out
long
ago
no
he
got
another
three
months
yet
garofoli
three
more
months
in
prison
mattia
could
breathe
i
left
the
horrible
yard
as
quickly
as
possible
and
hurried
off
to
the
hotel
du
cantal
i
was
full
of
hope
and
joy
and
quite
disposed
to
think
kindly
of
barberin
if
it
had
not
been
for
barberin
i
might
have
died
of
cold
and
hunger
when
i
was
a
baby
it
was
true
he
had
taken
me
from
mother
barberin
to
sell
me
to
a
stranger
but
then
he
had
no
liking
for
me
and
perhaps
he
was
forced
to
do
it
for
the
money
after
all
it
was
through
him
that
i
was
finding
my
parents
so
now
i
ought
not
to
harbor
any
bitterness
against
him
i
soon
reached
the
hotel
du
cantal
which
was
only
a
hotel
in
name
being
nothing
better
than
a
miserable
lodging
house
i
want
to
see
a
man
named
barberin
he
comes
from
chavanon
i
said
to
a
dirty
old
woman
who
sat
at
a
desk
she
was
very
deaf
and
asked
me
to
repeat
what
i
had
said
do
you
know
a
man
named
barberin
i
shouted
then
she
threw
up
her
hands
to
heaven
so
abruptly
that
the
cat
sleeping
on
her
knees
sprang
down
in
terror
alas
alas
she
cried
then
she
added
are
you
the
boy
he
was
looking
for
oh
you
know
i
cried
excitedly
well
where
barberin
dead
she
replied
laconically
i
leaned
on
my
harp
dead
i
cried
loud
enough
for
her
to
hear
i
was
dazed
how
should
i
find
my
parents
now
you
the
boy
they
looking
for
i
sure
you
are
said
the
old
woman
again
yes
yes
i
the
boy
where
my
family
can
you
tell
me
i
do
know
any
more
than
just
what
i
told
you
my
boy
i
should
say
my
young
gentleman
what
did
barberin
say
about
my
parents
oh
do
tell
me
i
said
imploringly
she
threw
her
arms
up
towards
heaven
ah
if
that
is
a
story
well
tell
it
me
what
is
it
at
this
moment
a
woman
who
looked
like
a
servant
came
forward
the
mistress
of
the
hotel
du
cantal
turned
to
her
if
this
is
an
affair
this
boy
here
this
young
gentleman
is
the
man
barberin
talked
so
much
about
but
did
barberin
speak
to
you
about
my
family
i
asked
i
should
say
so
more
than
a
hundred
times
a
very
rich
family
it
is
that
you
got
my
boy
my
young
gentleman
and
where
do
they
live
and
what
is
their
name
barberin
would
tell
us
anything
he
was
that
mysterious
he
wanted
to
get
all
the
reward
for
himself
did
he
leave
any
papers
no
nothing
except
one
that
said
he
came
from
chavanon
if
we
found
that
we
could
have
let
his
wife
know
he
dead
oh
you
did
let
her
know
sure
why
not
i
could
learn
nothing
from
the
old
woman
i
turned
slowly
towards
the
door
where
are
you
going
she
asked
back
to
my
friend
ah
you
have
a
friend
does
he
live
in
paris
we
got
to
paris
only
this
morning
well
if
you
have
a
place
to
lodge
in
why
do
you
come
here
you
will
be
well
taken
care
of
and
it
an
honest
house
if
your
family
get
tired
of
waiting
to
hear
from
barberin
they
may
come
here
and
then
they
find
you
what
i
say
is
for
your
own
interest
what
age
is
your
friend
he
is
a
little
younger
than
i
just
think
two
boys
on
the
streets
of
paris
you
could
get
into
such
a
bad
place
now
this
is
real
respectable
on
account
of
the
locality
the
hotel
du
cantal
was
one
of
the
dirtiest
lodging
houses
that
i
had
ever
seen
and
i
had
seen
some
pretty
dirty
ones
but
what
the
old
woman
said
was
worth
considering
besides
we
could
not
be
particular
i
had
not
found
my
family
in
their
beautiful
paris
mansion
yet
mattia
had
been
right
to
want
to
get
all
the
money
we
could
on
our
way
to
the
city
what
should
we
have
done
if
we
had
not
our
seventeen
francs
in
our
pockets
how
much
will
you
charge
for
a
room
for
my
friend
and
myself
i
asked
ten
cents
a
day
that
not
much
well
we
come
back
come
back
early
paris
is
a
bad
place
at
night
for
boys
she
called
after
me
night
was
falling
the
street
lamps
were
lit
i
had
a
long
way
to
walk
to
the
cathedral
where
i
was
to
meet
mattia
all
my
high
spirits
had
vanished
i
was
very
tired
and
all
around
me
seemed
gloomy
in
this
great
paris
full
of
light
and
noise
i
felt
so
utterly
alone
would
i
ever
find
my
own
people
was
i
ever
to
see
my
real
mother
and
my
real
father
when
i
reached
the
cathedral
i
had
still
twenty
minutes
to
wait
for
mattia
i
felt
this
night
that
i
needed
his
friendship
more
than
ever
what
a
comfort
it
was
to
think
that
i
was
going
to
see
him
so
gay
so
kind
such
a
friend
a
little
before
seven
i
heard
a
quirk
hark
then
out
of
the
shadows
jumped
capi
he
sprang
onto
my
knees
and
licked
me
with
his
soft
wet
tongue
i
hugged
him
in
my
arms
and
kissed
his
cold
nose
it
was
not
long
before
mattia
appeared
in
a
few
words
i
told
him
that
barberin
was
dead
and
that
there
was
now
little
hope
that
i
could
ever
find
my
family
then
he
gave
me
all
the
sympathy
of
which
i
was
in
need
he
tried
to
console
me
and
told
me
not
to
despair
he
wished
as
sincerely
as
i
that
we
could
find
my
parents
we
returned
to
the
hotel
du
cantal
the
next
morning
i
wrote
to
mother
barberin
to
express
my
grief
for
her
loss
and
to
ask
her
if
she
had
had
any
news
from
her
husband
before
he
died
by
return
mail
she
sent
me
word
that
her
husband
had
written
to
her
from
the
hospital
where
they
had
taken
him
and
said
that
if
he
did
not
get
better
she
was
to
write
to
greth
and
galley
lincoln
square
london
for
they
were
the
lawyers
who
were
looking
for
me
he
told
her
that
she
was
not
to
take
any
steps
until
she
was
sure
that
he
was
dead
we
must
go
to
london
said
mattia
when
i
had
finished
reading
the
letter
that
the
priest
had
written
for
her
if
the
lawyers
are
english
that
shows
that
your
parents
are
english
oh
i
rather
be
the
same
as
lise
and
the
others
but
i
added
if
i
english
i
be
the
same
as
milligan
and
arthur
i
rather
you
were
italian
said
mattia
in
a
few
minutes
our
baggage
was
ready
and
we
were
off
it
took
us
eight
days
to
hike
from
paris
to
bologne
stopping
at
the
principal
towns
en
route
when
we
reached
bologne
we
had
francs
in
our
purse
we
took
passage
on
a
cargo
boat
that
was
going
the
next
day
to
london
what
a
rough
journey
we
had
poor
mattia
declared
that
he
would
never
go
on
the
sea
again
when
at
last
we
were
steaming
up
the
thames
i
begged
him
to
get
up
and
see
the
wonderful
sights
but
he
implored
me
to
let
him
alone
at
last
the
engine
stopped
and
the
ropes
were
thrown
to
the
ground
and
we
landed
in
london
i
knew
very
little
english
but
mattia
had
picked
up
quite
a
great
deal
from
an
englishman
who
had
worked
with
him
at
the
gassot
circus
when
we
landed
he
at
once
asked
a
policeman
to
direct
us
to
lincoln
square
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
long
way
many
times
we
thought
that
we
had
lost
ourselves
but
again
upon
making
inquiries
we
found
that
we
were
going
in
the
right
direction
finally
we
reached
temple
bar
and
a
few
steps
further
we
came
to
green
square
my
heart
heat
so
quickly
when
we
stood
before
the
door
of
greth
and
galley
office
that
i
had
to
ask
mattia
to
wait
a
moment
until
i
had
recovered
myself
after
mattia
had
stated
to
the
clerk
my
name
and
my
business
we
were
shown
at
once
into
the
private
office
of
the
head
of
the
firm
greth
fortunately
this
gentleman
spoke
french
so
i
was
able
to
speak
to
him
myself
he
questioned
me
upon
every
detail
of
my
life
my
answers
evidently
convinced
him
that
i
was
the
boy
he
was
looking
for
for
he
told
me
that
i
had
a
family
living
in
london
and
that
he
would
send
me
to
them
at
once
one
moment
sir
have
i
a
father
i
asked
scarcely
able
to
say
the
word
father
yes
not
only
a
father
but
a
mother
brothers
and
sisters
he
replied
oh
he
touched
a
bell
and
a
clerk
appeared
whom
he
told
to
take
charge
of
us
oh
i
had
forgotten
said
greth
your
name
is
driscoll
your
father
name
is
john
driscoll
in
spite
of
greth
ugly
face
i
think
i
could
have
jumped
at
him
and
hugged
him
if
he
had
given
me
time
but
with
his
hand
he
indicated
the
door
and
we
followed
the
clerk
chapter
xxvi
bitter
disappointment
when
we
got
to
the
street
the
clerk
hailed
a
cab
and
told
us
to
jump
in
the
strange
looking
vehicle
with
the
coachman
sitting
on
a
box
at
the
back
of
a
hood
that
covered
us
i
learned
later
was
a
hansom
cab
mattia
and
i
were
huddled
in
a
corner
with
capi
between
our
legs
the
clerk
took
up
the
rest
of
the
seat
mattia
had
heard
him
tell
the
coachman
to
drive
us
to
the
driver
seemed
none
too
anxious
to
take
us
there
mattia
and
i
thought
it
was
probably
on
account
of
the
distance
we
both
knew
what
green
meant
in
english
and
undoubtedly
was
the
name
of
the
park
where
my
people
lived
for
a
long
time
the
cab
rolled
through
the
busy
streets
of
london
it
was
such
a
long
way
that
i
thought
perhaps
their
estate
was
situated
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
the
word
green
made
us
think
that
it
might
be
in
the
country
but
nothing
around
us
announced
the
country
we
were
in
a
very
thickly
populated
quarter
the
black
mud
splashed
our
cab
as
we
drove
along
then
we
turned
into
a
much
poorer
part
of
the
city
and
every
now
and
again
the
cabman
pulled
up
as
though
he
did
not
know
his
way
at
last
he
stopped
altogether
and
through
the
little
window
of
the
hansom
a
discussion
took
place
between
greth
galley
clerk
and
the
bewildered
cabman
from
what
mattia
could
learn
the
man
said
that
it
was
no
use
he
could
not
find
his
way
and
he
asked
the
clerk
which
direction
he
should
take
the
clerk
replied
that
he
did
not
know
for
he
had
never
been
in
that
thieves
locality
before
we
both
caught
the
word
thieves
then
the
clerk
gave
some
money
to
the
coachman
and
told
us
to
get
out
of
the
cab
the
man
grumbled
at
his
fare
and
then
turned
round
and
drove
off
we
were
standing
now
in
a
muddy
street
before
what
the
english
call
a
gin
palace
our
guide
looked
about
him
in
disgust
then
entered
the
of
the
gin
palace
we
followed
although
we
were
in
a
miserable
part
of
the
city
i
had
never
seen
anything
more
luxurious
there
were
gilt
framed
mirrors
everywhere
glass
chandeliers
and
a
magnificent
counter
that
shone
like
silver
yet
the
people
who
filled
this
place
were
filthy
and
in
rags
our
guide
gulped
down
a
drink
standing
before
the
beautiful
counter
then
asked
the
man
who
had
served
him
if
he
could
direct
him
to
the
place
he
wanted
to
find
evidently
he
got
the
information
he
required
for
he
hurried
out
again
through
the
we
following
close
on
his
heels
the
streets
through
which
we
walked
now
were
even
narrower
and
from
one
house
across
to
another
were
swung
wash
lines
from
which
dirty
rags
were
hanging
the
women
who
sat
in
their
doorways
were
pale
and
their
matted
fair
hair
hung
loose
over
their
shoulders
the
children
were
almost
naked
and
the
few
clothes
that
they
did
wear
were
but
rags
in
the
alley
were
some
pigs
wallowing
in
the
stagnant
water
from
which
a
fetid
odor
arose
our
guide
stopped
evidently
he
had
lost
his
way
but
at
this
moment
a
policeman
appeared
the
clerk
spoke
to
him
and
the
officer
told
him
he
would
show
him
the
way
we
followed
the
policeman
down
more
narrow
streets
at
last
we
stopped
at
a
yard
in
the
middle
of
which
was
a
little
pond
this
is
red
lion
court
said
the
officer
why
were
we
stopping
there
could
it
be
possible
that
my
parents
lived
in
this
place
the
policeman
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
wooden
hut
and
our
guide
thanked
him
so
we
had
arrived
mattia
took
my
hand
and
gently
pressed
it
i
pressed
his
we
understood
one
another
i
was
as
in
a
dream
when
the
door
was
opened
and
we
found
ourselves
in
a
room
with
a
big
fire
burning
in
the
grate
before
the
fire
in
a
large
cane
chair
sat
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
and
his
head
covered
with
a
black
skull
cap
at
a
table
sat
a
man
of
about
forty
and
a
woman
about
six
years
his
junior
she
must
have
been
very
pretty
once
but
now
her
eyes
had
a
glassy
stare
and
her
manners
were
listless
then
there
were
four
children
two
boys
and
two
girls
all
very
fair
like
their
mother
the
eldest
boy
was
about
eleven
the
youngest
girl
scarcely
three
i
did
not
know
what
the
clerk
was
saying
to
the
man
i
only
caught
the
name
driscoll
my
name
so
the
lawyer
had
said
all
eyes
were
turned
on
mattia
and
me
only
the
baby
girl
paid
attention
to
capi
which
one
is
remi
asked
the
man
in
french
i
am
i
said
taking
a
step
forward
then
come
and
kiss
your
father
my
boy
when
i
had
thought
of
this
moment
i
had
imagined
that
i
should
be
overwhelmed
with
happiness
and
spring
into
my
father
arms
but
i
felt
nothing
of
the
kind
i
went
up
and
kissed
my
father
now
he
said
there
your
grandfather
your
mother
your
brothers
and
sisters
i
went
up
to
my
mother
first
and
put
my
arms
about
her
she
let
me
kiss
her
but
she
did
not
return
my
caress
she
only
said
two
or
three
words
which
i
did
not
understand
shake
hands
with
your
grandfather
said
my
father
and
go
gently
he
paralyzed
i
also
shook
hands
with
my
brothers
and
my
eldest
sister
i
wanted
to
take
the
little
one
in
my
arms
but
she
was
too
occupied
with
capi
and
pushed
me
away
as
i
went
from
one
to
the
other
i
was
angry
with
myself
why
could
i
not
feel
any
pleasure
at
having
found
my
family
at
last
i
had
a
father
a
mother
brothers
sisters
and
a
grandfather
i
had
longed
for
this
moment
i
had
been
mad
with
joy
in
thinking
that
i
like
other
boys
would
have
a
family
that
i
could
call
my
own
to
love
me
and
whom
i
could
love
and
now
i
was
staring
at
my
family
curiously
finding
nothing
in
my
heart
to
say
to
them
not
a
word
of
affection
was
i
a
monster
if
i
had
found
my
parents
in
a
palace
instead
of
in
a
hovel
should
i
have
had
more
affection
for
them
i
felt
ashamed
at
this
thought
going
over
again
to
my
mother
i
put
my
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
full
on
the
lips
evidently
she
did
not
understand
what
made
me
do
this
for
instead
of
returning
my
kisses
she
looked
at
me
in
a
listless
manner
then
turning
to
her
husband
my
father
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
said
something
that
i
could
not
understand
but
which
made
him
laugh
her
indifference
and
my
father
laugh
went
right
to
my
heart
it
did
not
seem
to
me
that
my
affection
should
have
been
received
in
such
a
way
who
is
he
asked
my
father
pointing
to
mattia
i
told
him
that
mattia
was
my
dearest
friend
and
how
much
i
owed
him
good
said
my
father
would
he
like
to
stay
and
see
the
country
i
was
about
to
answer
for
mattia
but
he
spoke
first
that
just
what
i
want
he
exclaimed
my
father
then
asked
why
barberin
had
not
come
with
me
i
told
him
that
he
was
dead
he
seemed
pleased
to
hear
this
he
repeated
it
to
my
mother
who
also
seemed
pleased
why
were
they
both
pleased
that
barberin
was
dead
you
must
be
rather
surprised
that
we
have
not
searched
for
you
for
thirteen
years
said
my
father
and
then
suddenly
to
go
off
and
look
up
this
man
who
found
you
when
you
were
a
baby
i
told
him
that
i
was
very
surprised
and
that
i
like
to
know
about
it
come
near
the
fire
then
and
i
tell
you
all
about
it
i
flung
the
bag
from
my
shoulders
and
took
the
chair
that
he
offered
me
as
i
stretched
out
my
legs
wet
and
covered
with
mud
to
the
fire
my
grandfather
spat
on
one
side
like
an
old
cat
that
is
annoyed
do
pay
any
attention
to
him
said
my
father
the
old
chap
like
any
one
to
sit
before
his
fire
but
you
need
mind
him
if
cold
i
was
surprised
to
hear
any
one
speak
like
this
of
an
old
man
i
kept
my
legs
under
my
chair
for
i
thought
that
attention
should
be
paid
to
him
you
are
my
eldest
son
now
said
my
father
you
were
born
a
year
after
my
marriage
with
your
mother
when
i
married
there
was
a
young
girl
who
thought
that
i
was
going
to
marry
her
and
out
of
revenge
she
stole
you
from
us
when
you
were
six
months
old
we
searched
everywhere
for
you
but
we
did
not
go
so
far
as
paris
we
thought
that
you
were
dead
until
three
months
ago
when
this
woman
was
dying
she
confessed
the
truth
i
went
over
to
france
at
once
and
the
police
in
that
locality
where
you
had
been
left
told
me
that
you
had
been
adopted
by
a
mason
named
barberin
who
lived
at
chavanon
i
found
him
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
loaned
you
to
a
musician
named
vitalis
and
that
you
were
tramping
through
france
i
could
not
stay
over
there
any
longer
but
i
left
barberin
some
money
and
told
him
to
search
for
you
and
when
he
had
news
to
write
to
greth
and
galley
i
did
not
give
him
my
address
here
because
we
are
only
in
london
during
the
winter
the
rest
of
the
year
we
travel
through
england
and
scotland
we
are
peddlers
by
trade
and
i
have
my
own
caravans
there
boy
that
is
how
it
is
you
have
come
back
to
us
after
thirteen
years
you
may
feel
a
little
timid
at
first
because
you
understand
us
but
you
soon
pick
up
english
and
be
able
to
talk
to
your
brothers
and
sisters
it
wo
be
long
before
you
used
to
us
yes
of
course
i
should
get
used
to
them
were
they
not
my
own
people
the
fine
baby
linen
the
beautiful
clothes
had
not
spoken
the
truth
but
what
did
that
matter
affection
was
worth
more
than
riches
it
was
not
money
that
i
pined
for
but
to
have
affection
a
family
and
a
home
while
my
father
was
talking
to
me
they
had
set
the
table
for
supper
a
large
joint
of
roast
beef
with
potatoes
round
it
was
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
are
you
hungry
boys
asked
my
father
addressing
mattia
and
myself
mattia
showed
his
white
teeth
well
sit
down
to
table
but
before
sitting
down
he
pushed
my
grandfather
cane
rocker
up
to
the
table
then
taking
his
own
place
with
his
back
to
the
fire
he
commenced
to
cut
the
roast
beef
and
gave
each
one
a
fine
big
slice
and
some
potatoes
although
i
had
not
been
brought
up
exactly
on
the
principle
of
good
breeding
i
noticed
that
my
brothers
and
sister
behaved
very
badly
at
table
they
ate
more
often
with
their
fingers
sticking
them
into
the
gravy
and
licking
them
without
my
father
and
mother
seeming
to
notice
them
as
to
my
grandfather
he
gave
his
whole
attention
to
what
was
before
him
and
the
one
hand
that
he
was
able
to
use
went
continually
from
his
plate
to
his
mouth
when
he
let
a
piece
fall
from
his
shaking
fingers
my
brothers
and
sisters
laughed
i
thought
that
we
should
spend
the
evening
together
round
the
fire
but
my
father
said
that
he
was
expecting
friends
and
told
us
to
go
to
bed
beckoning
to
mattia
and
me
he
took
a
candle
and
went
out
to
a
stable
that
led
from
the
room
where
we
had
been
eating
in
this
stable
were
two
big
caravans
he
opened
the
door
of
one
and
we
saw
two
small
beds
one
above
the
other
there
you
are
boys
there
are
your
beds
he
said
sleep
well
such
was
the
welcome
into
my
family
chapter
xxvii
a
distressing
discovery
my
father
left
the
candle
with
us
but
locked
the
caravan
on
the
outside
we
got
into
bed
as
quickly
as
possible
without
chatting
as
was
our
habit
mattia
did
not
seem
to
want
to
talk
any
more
than
i
and
i
was
pleased
that
he
was
silent
we
blew
the
candle
out
but
i
found
it
impossible
to
go
to
sleep
i
thought
over
all
that
had
passed
turning
over
and
over
in
my
narrow
bed
i
could
hear
mattia
who
occupied
the
berth
above
mine
turn
over
restlessly
also
he
could
not
sleep
any
more
than
i
hours
passed
as
it
grew
later
a
vague
fear
oppressed
me
i
felt
uneasy
but
i
could
not
understand
why
it
was
that
i
felt
so
of
what
was
i
afraid
not
of
sleeping
in
a
caravan
even
in
this
vile
part
of
london
how
many
times
in
my
vagabond
life
had
i
spent
the
night
less
protected
than
i
was
at
this
moment
i
knew
that
i
was
sheltered
from
all
danger
and
yet
i
was
oppressed
with
a
fear
that
amounted
almost
to
terror
the
hours
passed
one
after
the
other
suddenly
i
heard
a
noise
at
the
stable
door
which
opened
onto
another
street
then
came
several
regular
knocks
at
intervals
then
a
light
penetrated
our
caravan
i
glanced
hastily
round
in
surprise
and
capi
who
slept
beside
my
bed
woke
up
with
a
growl
i
then
saw
that
this
light
came
in
through
a
little
window
of
the
caravan
against
which
our
berths
were
placed
and
which
i
had
not
noticed
when
going
to
bed
because
there
was
a
curtain
hanging
over
it
the
upper
part
of
this
window
touched
mattia
bed
and
the
lower
part
touched
mine
afraid
that
capi
might
wake
up
all
the
house
i
put
my
hand
over
his
mouth
then
looked
outside
my
father
had
entered
the
stable
and
quietly
opened
the
door
on
the
other
side
then
he
closed
it
again
in
the
same
cautious
manner
after
admitting
two
men
heavily
laden
with
bundles
which
they
carried
on
their
shoulders
then
he
placed
his
finger
on
his
lip
and
with
the
other
hand
which
held
the
lantern
he
pointed
to
the
caravan
in
which
we
were
sleeping
i
was
about
to
call
out
that
they
need
not
mind
us
but
i
was
afraid
i
should
wake
up
mattia
who
now
i
thought
was
sleeping
quietly
so
i
kept
still
my
father
helped
the
two
men
unload
their
bundles
then
he
disappeared
but
soon
he
returned
with
my
mother
during
his
absence
the
men
had
opened
their
baggage
there
were
hats
underclothes
stockings
gloves
etc
evidently
these
men
were
merchants
who
had
come
to
sell
their
goods
to
my
parents
my
father
took
each
object
and
examined
it
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
and
passed
it
on
to
my
mother
who
with
a
little
pair
of
scissors
cut
off
the
tickets
and
put
them
in
her
pocket
this
appeared
strange
to
me
as
also
the
hour
that
they
had
chosen
for
this
sale
while
my
mother
was
examining
the
goods
my
father
spoke
to
the
men
in
a
whisper
if
i
had
known
english
a
little
better
i
should
perhaps
have
caught
what
he
said
but
all
i
could
hear
was
the
word
police
that
was
said
several
times
and
for
that
reason
caught
my
ear
when
all
the
goods
had
been
carefully
noted
my
parents
and
the
two
men
went
into
the
house
and
again
our
caravan
was
in
darkness
they
had
evidently
gone
inside
to
settle
the
bill
i
wanted
to
convince
myself
that
what
i
had
seen
was
quite
natural
yet
despite
my
desire
i
could
not
believe
so
why
had
not
these
men
who
had
come
to
see
my
parents
entered
by
the
other
door
why
did
they
talk
of
the
police
in
whispers
as
though
they
were
afraid
of
being
heard
outside
why
had
my
mother
cut
off
the
tickets
after
she
had
bought
the
goods
i
could
not
drive
these
thoughts
from
my
mind
after
a
time
a
light
again
filled
our
caravan
i
looked
out
this
time
in
spite
of
myself
i
told
myself
that
i
ought
not
to
look
and
yet
i
looked
i
told
myself
that
it
was
better
that
i
should
not
know
and
yet
i
wanted
to
see
my
father
and
mother
were
alone
while
my
mother
quickly
made
a
bundle
of
the
goods
my
father
swept
a
corner
of
the
stable
under
the
dry
sand
that
he
heaped
up
there
was
a
trap
door
he
lifted
it
by
then
my
mother
had
finished
tying
up
the
bundles
and
my
father
took
them
and
lowered
them
through
the
trap
to
a
cellar
below
my
mother
holding
the
lantern
to
light
him
then
he
shut
the
trap
door
and
swept
the
sand
over
it
again
over
the
sand
they
both
strewed
wisps
of
straw
as
on
the
rest
of
the
stable
floor
then
they
went
out
at
the
moment
when
they
softly
closed
the
door
it
seemed
to
me
that
mattia
moved
in
his
bed
and
that
he
lay
back
on
his
pillow
had
he
seen
i
did
not
dare
ask
him
from
head
to
foot
i
was
in
a
cold
perspiration
i
remained
in
this
state
all
night
long
a
cock
crowed
at
daybreak
then
only
did
i
drop
off
to
sleep
the
noise
of
the
key
being
turned
in
the
door
of
our
caravan
the
next
morning
woke
me
thinking
that
it
was
my
father
who
had
come
to
tell
us
that
it
was
time
to
get
up
i
closed
my
eyes
so
as
not
to
see
him
it
was
your
brother
said
mattia
he
has
unlocked
the
door
and
gone
now
we
dressed
mattia
did
not
ask
me
if
i
had
slept
well
neither
did
i
put
the
question
to
him
once
i
caught
him
looking
at
me
and
i
turned
my
eyes
away
we
had
to
go
to
the
kitchen
but
neither
my
father
nor
mother
were
there
my
grandfather
was
seated
before
the
fire
in
his
big
chair
as
though
he
had
not
moved
since
the
night
before
and
my
eldest
sister
whose
name
was
annie
was
wiping
the
table
allen
my
eldest
brother
was
sweeping
the
room
i
went
over
to
them
to
wish
them
good
morning
but
they
continued
with
their
work
without
taking
any
notice
of
me
i
went
towards
my
grandfather
but
he
would
not
let
me
get
near
him
and
like
the
evening
before
he
spat
at
my
side
which
stopped
me
short
ask
them
i
said
to
mattia
what
time
i
shall
see
my
mother
and
father
mattia
did
as
i
told
him
and
my
grandfather
upon
hearing
one
of
us
speak
english
seemed
to
feel
more
amiable
what
does
he
say
he
says
that
your
father
has
gone
out
for
the
day
and
that
your
mother
is
asleep
and
that
if
we
like
we
may
go
out
did
he
only
say
that
i
asked
finding
this
translation
very
short
mattia
seemed
confused
i
do
know
if
i
understood
the
rest
he
said
tell
me
what
you
think
you
understood
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
said
that
if
we
found
some
bargains
in
the
city
we
were
not
to
miss
them
he
said
that
we
lived
at
the
expense
of
fools
my
grandfather
must
have
guessed
that
mattia
was
explaining
what
he
had
said
to
me
for
with
the
hand
that
was
not
paralyzed
he
made
a
motion
as
though
he
were
slipping
something
into
his
pocket
then
he
winked
his
eye
let
us
go
out
i
said
quickly
for
two
or
three
hours
we
walked
about
not
daring
to
go
far
for
fear
we
might
become
lost
was
even
more
horrible
in
the
daytime
than
it
had
been
at
night
mattia
and
i
hardly
spoke
a
word
now
and
again
he
pressed
my
hand
when
we
returned
to
the
house
my
mother
had
not
left
her
room
through
the
open
door
i
could
see
that
she
was
leaning
her
head
on
the
table
thinking
that
she
was
sick
i
ran
to
her
to
kiss
her
as
i
was
unable
to
speak
to
her
she
lifted
up
her
head
which
swayed
she
looked
at
me
but
did
not
see
me
i
smelled
the
odor
of
gin
on
her
hot
breath
i
drew
back
her
head
fell
again
on
her
arms
resting
on
the
table
gin
said
my
grandfather
grinning
i
remained
motionless
i
felt
turned
to
stone
i
do
know
how
long
i
stood
so
suddenly
i
turned
to
mattia
he
was
looking
at
me
with
eyes
full
of
tears
i
signed
to
him
and
again
we
left
the
house
for
a
long
time
we
walked
about
side
by
side
holding
each
other
hands
saying
nothing
going
straight
before
us
without
knowing
where
we
were
going
where
do
you
want
to
go
remi
he
asked
at
last
anxiously
i
do
know
somewhere
so
we
can
talk
i
want
to
speak
to
you
mattia
we
ca
talk
in
this
crowd
we
had
by
this
time
come
to
a
much
wider
street
at
the
end
of
which
was
a
public
garden
we
hurried
to
this
spot
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
you
know
how
much
i
love
you
mattia
boy
i
began
and
you
know
that
it
was
through
friendship
for
you
that
i
asked
you
to
come
with
me
to
see
my
people
you
wo
doubt
my
friendship
no
matter
what
i
ask
of
you
do
be
such
a
silly
he
said
forcing
a
smile
you
want
to
laugh
so
that
i
wo
break
down
i
replied
if
i
cry
when
i
with
you
when
can
i
cry
but
oh
oh
mattia
mattia
throwing
my
arms
around
dear
old
mattia
neck
i
burst
into
tears
never
had
i
felt
so
miserable
when
i
had
been
alone
in
this
great
world
never
had
i
felt
so
unhappy
as
i
did
at
this
moment
after
my
burst
of
sobs
i
forced
myself
to
be
calm
it
was
not
because
i
wanted
mattia
pity
that
i
had
brought
him
to
this
garden
it
was
not
for
myself
it
was
for
him
mattia
i
said
resolutely
you
must
go
back
to
france
leave
you
never
i
knew
beforehand
what
you
would
reply
and
i
am
pleased
oh
so
pleased
that
you
wish
to
be
with
me
but
mattia
you
go
back
to
france
at
once
why
tell
me
that
because
tell
me
mattia
do
be
afraid
did
you
sleep
last
night
did
you
see
i
did
not
sleep
he
answered
and
you
saw
all
and
you
understood
that
those
goods
had
not
been
paid
for
your
father
was
angry
with
the
men
because
they
knocked
at
the
stable
door
and
not
at
the
house
door
they
told
him
that
the
police
were
watching
them
you
see
very
well
then
that
you
must
go
i
said
if
i
must
go
you
must
go
also
it
is
no
better
for
one
than
for
the
other
if
you
had
met
garofoli
in
paris
and
he
had
forced
you
to
go
back
to
him
i
am
sure
you
would
not
have
wanted
me
to
stay
with
you
i
am
simply
doing
what
you
would
do
yourself
he
did
not
reply
you
must
go
back
to
france
i
insisted
go
to
lise
and
tell
her
that
i
can
not
do
for
her
father
what
i
promised
i
told
her
that
the
first
thing
i
did
would
be
to
pay
off
his
debts
you
must
tell
her
how
it
is
and
go
to
mother
barberin
also
simply
say
that
my
people
are
not
rich
as
i
had
thought
there
is
no
disgrace
in
not
having
money
tell
them
anything
it
is
not
because
they
are
poor
that
you
want
me
to
go
so
i
go
mattia
replied
obstinately
i
know
what
it
is
after
what
we
saw
last
night
you
are
afraid
for
me
mattia
do
say
that
you
are
afraid
one
day
that
i
shall
cut
the
tickets
off
goods
that
have
not
been
paid
for
mattia
mattia
do
well
if
you
are
afraid
for
me
i
am
afraid
for
you
let
us
both
go
it
impossible
my
parents
are
nothing
to
you
but
this
is
my
father
and
mother
and
i
must
stay
with
them
it
is
my
family
your
family
that
man
who
steals
your
father
that
drunken
woman
your
mother
do
you
dare
say
so
mattia
i
cried
springing
up
from
my
seat
you
are
speaking
of
my
father
and
mother
and
i
must
respect
them
and
love
them
yes
so
you
should
if
they
are
your
people
but
are
they
you
forget
their
many
proofs
you
do
resemble
your
father
or
your
mother
their
children
are
all
fair
while
you
are
dark
and
then
how
is
it
they
could
spend
so
much
money
to
find
a
child
put
all
these
things
together
and
in
my
opinion
you
are
not
a
driscoll
you
might
write
to
mother
barberin
and
ask
her
to
tell
you
just
what
the
clothes
were
like
that
you
wore
when
you
were
found
then
ask
that
man
you
call
your
father
to
describe
the
clothes
his
baby
had
on
when
it
was
stolen
until
then
i
sha
move
but
suppose
one
day
mattia
gets
a
bang
on
his
poor
head
that
would
not
be
so
hard
if
he
received
the
blow
for
a
friend
he
said
smiling
we
did
not
return
to
the
red
lion
court
until
night
my
father
and
mother
passed
no
remark
upon
our
absence
after
supper
my
father
drew
two
chairs
to
the
fireside
which
brought
a
growl
from
my
grandfather
and
then
asked
us
to
tell
him
how
we
had
made
enough
money
to
live
on
in
france
i
told
the
story
not
only
did
we
earn
enough
to
live
on
but
we
got
enough
to
buy
a
cow
said
mattia
with
assurance
in
his
turn
he
told
how
we
came
by
the
cow
you
must
be
clever
kids
said
my
father
show
us
what
you
can
do
i
took
my
harp
and
played
a
piece
but
not
my
neapolitan
song
mattia
played
a
piece
on
his
violin
and
a
piece
on
his
cornet
it
was
the
cornet
solo
that
brought
the
greatest
applause
from
the
children
who
had
gathered
round
us
in
a
circle
and
capi
can
he
do
anything
asked
my
father
he
ought
to
be
able
to
earn
his
food
i
was
very
proud
of
capi
talents
i
put
him
through
all
his
tricks
and
as
usual
he
scored
a
great
success
why
that
dog
is
worth
a
fortune
exclaimed
my
father
i
was
very
pleased
at
this
praise
and
assured
him
that
capi
could
learn
anything
that
one
wished
to
teach
him
my
father
translated
what
i
said
into
english
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
added
something
more
which
made
everybody
laugh
for
the
old
grandfather
winked
his
eye
several
times
and
said
fine
dog
this
is
what
i
suggest
said
my
father
that
is
if
mattia
would
like
to
live
with
us
i
want
to
stay
with
remi
replied
mattia
well
this
is
what
i
propose
continued
my
father
we
not
rich
and
we
all
work
in
the
summer
we
travel
through
the
country
and
the
children
go
and
sell
the
goods
to
those
who
wo
take
the
trouble
to
come
to
us
but
in
the
winter
we
have
much
to
do
now
you
and
remi
can
go
and
play
music
in
the
streets
you
make
quite
a
little
money
as
christmas
draws
near
but
ned
and
allen
must
take
capi
with
them
and
he
make
the
people
laugh
with
his
tricks
in
that
way
the
talent
will
be
distributed
capi
wo
work
well
with
any
one
but
me
i
said
quickly
i
could
not
bear
to
be
parted
from
my
dog
he
learn
to
work
with
allen
and
ned
easy
said
my
father
get
more
money
this
way
oh
but
we
get
ever
so
much
more
with
capi
i
insisted
that
enough
replied
my
father
briefly
when
i
say
a
thing
i
mean
it
no
arguments
i
said
nothing
more
as
i
laid
down
in
my
bed
that
night
mattia
whispered
in
my
ear
now
you
write
to
mother
barberin
then
he
jumped
into
bed
but
the
next
morning
i
had
to
give
capi
his
lesson
i
took
him
in
my
arms
and
while
i
gently
kissed
him
on
his
cold
nose
i
explained
to
him
what
he
had
to
do
poor
doggy
how
he
looked
at
me
how
he
listened
i
then
put
his
leash
in
allen
hand
and
he
followed
the
two
boys
obediently
but
with
a
forlorn
air
my
father
took
mattia
and
me
across
london
where
there
were
beautiful
houses
splendid
streets
with
wide
pavements
and
carriages
that
shone
like
glass
drawn
by
magnificent
horses
and
driven
by
big
fat
coachmen
with
powdered
wigs
it
was
late
when
we
got
back
to
red
lion
court
for
the
distance
from
the
west
end
to
is
great
how
pleased
i
was
to
see
capi
again
he
was
covered
with
mud
but
in
a
good
humor
i
was
so
pleased
to
see
him
that
after
i
had
rubbed
him
well
down
with
dry
straw
i
wrapped
him
in
my
sheepskin
and
made
him
sleep
in
my
bed
things
went
on
this
way
for
several
days
mattia
and
i
went
one
way
and
capi
ned
and
allen
another
then
one
evening
my
father
told
me
that
we
could
take
capi
the
next
day
with
us
as
he
wanted
the
two
boys
to
do
something
in
the
house
mattia
and
i
were
very
pleased
and
we
intended
to
do
our
utmost
to
bring
back
a
good
sum
of
money
so
that
he
would
let
us
have
the
dog
always
we
had
to
get
capi
back
and
we
would
not
spare
ourselves
neither
one
of
us
we
made
capi
undergo
a
severe
washing
and
combing
early
in
the
morning
then
we
went
off
unfortunately
for
our
plan
a
heavy
fog
had
been
hanging
over
london
for
two
entire
days
it
was
so
dense
that
we
could
only
see
a
few
steps
before
us
and
those
who
listened
to
us
playing
behind
these
fog
curtains
could
not
see
capi
it
was
a
most
annoying
state
of
affairs
for
our
takings
little
did
we
think
how
indebted
we
should
be
to
the
fog
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
walking
through
one
of
the
most
popular
streets
when
suddenly
i
discovered
that
capi
was
not
with
us
this
was
extraordinary
for
he
always
kept
close
at
our
heels
i
waited
for
him
to
catch
up
with
us
i
stood
at
the
entrance
of
a
dark
alley
and
whistled
softly
for
we
could
see
but
a
short
distance
i
was
beginning
to
fear
that
he
had
been
stolen
from
us
when
he
came
up
on
the
run
holding
a
pair
of
woolen
stockings
between
his
teeth
placing
his
fore
paws
against
me
he
presented
them
to
me
with
a
bark
he
seemed
as
proud
as
when
he
had
accomplished
one
of
his
most
difficult
tricks
and
wanted
my
approval
it
was
all
done
in
a
few
seconds
i
stood
dumbfounded
then
mattia
seized
the
stockings
with
one
hand
and
pulled
me
down
the
alley
with
the
other
walk
quick
but
do
run
he
whispered
he
told
me
a
moment
later
that
a
man
who
had
hurried
past
him
on
the
pavement
was
saying
where
that
thief
i
get
him
we
went
out
by
the
other
end
of
the
alley
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
fog
we
should
have
been
arrested
as
thieves
said
mattia
for
a
moment
i
stood
almost
choking
they
had
made
a
thief
of
my
good
honest
capi
hold
him
tight
i
said
and
come
back
to
the
house
we
walked
quickly
the
father
and
mother
were
seated
at
the
table
folding
up
material
i
threw
the
pair
of
stockings
down
allen
and
ned
laughed
here
a
pair
of
stockings
i
said
you
made
a
thief
of
my
dog
i
thought
you
took
him
out
to
amuse
people
i
was
trembling
so
i
could
scarcely
speak
and
yet
i
never
felt
more
determined
and
if
it
was
not
for
amusement
demanded
my
father
what
would
you
do
i
like
to
know
i
tie
a
cord
round
capi
neck
and
although
i
love
him
dearly
drown
him
i
do
want
capi
to
become
a
thief
any
more
than
i
want
to
be
one
myself
and
if
i
thought
that
i
ever
should
become
a
thief
drown
myself
at
once
with
my
dog
my
father
looked
me
full
in
the
face
i
thought
he
was
going
to
strike
me
his
eyes
gleamed
i
did
not
flinch
oh
very
well
then
said
he
recovering
himself
so
that
it
shall
not
happen
again
you
may
take
capi
out
with
you
in
the
future
i
showed
my
fist
to
the
two
boys
i
could
not
speak
to
them
but
they
saw
by
my
manner
that
if
they
dared
have
anything
more
to
do
with
my
dog
they
would
have
me
to
reckon
with
i
was
willing
to
fight
them
both
to
protect
capi
from
that
day
every
one
in
my
family
openly
showed
their
dislike
for
me
my
grandfather
continued
to
spit
angrily
when
i
approached
him
the
boys
and
my
eldest
sister
played
every
trick
they
possibly
could
upon
me
my
father
and
mother
ignored
me
only
demanding
of
me
my
money
every
evening
out
of
the
whole
family
for
whom
i
had
felt
so
much
affection
when
i
had
landed
in
england
there
was
only
baby
kate
who
would
let
me
fondle
her
and
she
turned
from
me
coldly
if
i
had
not
candy
or
an
orange
in
my
pocket
for
her
although
i
would
not
listen
to
what
mattia
had
said
at
first
gradually
little
by
little
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
did
really
belong
to
this
family
i
had
done
nothing
for
them
to
be
so
unkind
to
me
mattia
seeing
me
so
greatly
worried
would
say
as
though
to
himself
i
am
just
wondering
what
kind
of
clothes
mother
barberin
will
tell
us
you
wore
at
last
the
letter
came
the
priest
had
written
it
for
her
it
read
my
little
remi
i
was
surprised
and
sorry
to
learn
the
contents
of
your
letter
from
what
barberin
told
me
and
also
from
the
clothes
you
had
on
when
you
were
found
i
thought
that
you
belonged
to
a
very
rich
family
i
can
easily
tell
you
what
you
wore
for
i
have
kept
everything
you
were
not
wound
up
in
wrappings
like
a
french
baby
you
wore
long
robes
and
underskirts
like
little
english
babies
you
had
on
a
white
flannel
robe
and
over
that
a
very
fine
linen
robe
then
a
big
white
cashmere
pelisse
lined
with
white
silk
and
trimmed
with
beautiful
white
embroidery
and
you
had
a
lovely
lace
bonnet
and
then
white
woolen
socks
with
little
silk
rosettes
none
of
these
things
were
marked
but
the
little
flannel
jacket
you
had
next
to
your
skin
and
the
flannel
robe
had
both
been
marked
but
the
marks
had
been
carefully
cut
out
there
remi
boy
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
do
worry
dear
child
that
you
ca
give
us
all
the
fine
presents
that
you
promised
your
cow
that
you
bought
with
your
savings
is
worth
all
the
presents
in
the
world
to
me
i
am
pleased
to
tell
you
that
she
in
good
health
and
gives
the
same
fine
quantity
of
milk
so
i
am
very
comfortably
off
now
and
i
never
look
at
her
without
thinking
of
you
and
your
little
friend
mattia
let
me
have
news
of
you
sometimes
dear
boy
you
are
so
tender
and
affectionate
and
i
hope
now
you
have
found
your
family
they
will
all
love
you
as
you
deserve
to
be
loved
i
kiss
you
lovingly
your
foster
mother
widow
barberin
dear
mother
barberin
she
imagined
that
everybody
must
love
me
because
she
did
she
a
fine
woman
said
mattia
very
fine
she
thought
of
me
now
let
see
what
driscoll
has
to
say
he
might
have
forgotten
the
things
does
one
forget
the
clothes
that
their
child
wears
when
it
was
kidnaped
why
it
only
through
its
clothes
that
they
can
find
it
wait
until
we
hear
what
he
says
before
we
think
anything
it
was
not
an
easy
thing
for
me
to
ask
my
father
how
i
was
dressed
on
the
day
that
i
was
stolen
if
i
had
put
the
question
casually
without
any
underthought
it
would
have
been
simple
enough
as
it
was
i
was
timid
then
one
day
when
the
cold
sleet
had
driven
me
home
earlier
than
usual
i
took
my
courage
in
both
hands
and
broached
the
subject
that
was
causing
me
so
much
anxiety
at
my
question
my
father
looked
me
full
in
the
face
but
i
looked
back
at
him
far
more
boldly
than
i
imagined
that
i
could
at
this
moment
then
he
smiled
there
was
something
hard
and
cruel
in
the
smile
but
still
it
was
a
smile
on
the
day
that
you
were
stolen
from
us
he
said
slowly
you
wore
a
flannel
robe
a
linen
robe
a
lace
bonnet
white
woolen
shoes
and
a
white
embroidered
cashmere
pelisse
two
of
your
garments
were
marked
francis
driscoll
your
real
name
but
this
mark
was
cut
out
by
the
woman
who
stole
you
for
she
hoped
that
in
this
way
you
would
never
be
found
i
show
you
your
baptismal
certificates
which
of
course
i
still
have
he
searched
in
a
drawer
and
soon
brought
forth
a
big
paper
which
he
handed
to
me
if
you
do
mind
i
said
with
a
last
effort
mattia
will
translate
it
for
me
certainly
mattia
translated
it
as
well
as
he
could
it
appeared
that
i
was
born
on
thursday
august
the
and
that
i
was
the
son
of
john
driscoll
and
margaret
grange
his
wife
what
further
proofs
could
i
ask
that
all
very
fine
said
mattia
that
night
when
we
were
in
our
caravan
but
how
comes
it
that
peddlers
were
rich
enough
to
give
their
children
lace
bonnets
and
embroidered
pelisses
peddlers
are
not
so
rich
as
that
it
is
because
they
were
peddlers
that
they
could
get
those
things
cheaper
mattia
whistled
but
he
shook
his
head
then
again
he
whispered
not
that
driscoll
baby
but
you
the
baby
that
driscoll
stole
i
was
about
to
reply
but
he
had
already
climbed
up
into
his
bed
chapter
xxviii
a
mysterious
stranger
if
i
had
been
in
mattia
place
i
should
perhaps
have
had
as
much
imagination
as
he
but
i
felt
in
my
position
that
it
was
wrong
for
me
to
have
such
thoughts
it
had
been
proved
beyond
a
doubt
that
driscoll
was
my
father
i
could
not
look
at
the
matter
from
the
same
point
of
view
as
mattia
he
might
doubt
but
i
must
not
when
he
tried
to
make
me
believe
as
he
did
i
told
him
to
be
silent
but
he
was
and
i
was
not
always
able
to
get
the
better
of
his
obstinacy
why
are
you
dark
and
all
the
rest
of
the
family
fair
he
would
ask
repeatedly
how
was
it
that
poor
people
could
dress
their
baby
in
fine
laces
and
embroidery
was
another
often
repeated
question
and
i
could
only
reply
by
putting
a
question
myself
why
did
they
search
for
me
if
i
was
not
their
child
why
had
they
given
money
to
barberin
and
to
greth
and
galley
mattia
could
find
no
answer
to
my
question
and
yet
he
would
not
be
convinced
i
think
we
should
both
go
back
to
france
he
urged
that
impossible
because
it
your
duty
to
keep
with
your
family
eh
but
is
it
your
family
these
discussions
only
had
one
result
they
made
me
more
unhappy
than
i
had
ever
been
how
terrible
it
is
to
doubt
yet
in
spite
of
my
wish
not
to
doubt
i
doubted
who
would
have
thought
when
i
was
crying
so
sadly
because
i
thought
i
had
no
family
that
i
should
be
in
such
despair
now
that
i
had
one
how
could
i
know
the
truth
in
the
meantime
i
had
to
sing
and
dance
and
laugh
and
make
grimaces
when
my
heart
was
full
one
sunday
my
father
told
me
to
stay
in
the
house
because
he
wanted
me
he
sent
mattia
off
alone
all
the
others
had
gone
out
my
grandfather
alone
was
upstairs
i
had
been
with
my
father
for
about
an
hour
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
a
gentleman
who
was
unlike
any
of
the
men
who
usually
called
on
my
father
came
in
he
was
about
fifty
years
old
and
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
he
had
white
pointed
teeth
like
a
dog
and
when
he
smiled
he
drew
his
lips
back
over
them
as
though
he
was
going
to
bite
he
spoke
to
my
father
in
english
turning
continually
to
look
at
me
then
he
began
to
talk
french
he
spoke
this
language
with
scarcely
an
accent
this
is
the
young
boy
that
you
spoke
to
me
about
he
said
he
appears
very
well
answer
the
gentleman
said
my
father
to
me
yes
i
am
quite
well
i
replied
surprised
you
have
never
been
ill
i
had
pneumonia
once
ah
when
was
that
three
years
ago
i
slept
out
in
the
cold
all
night
my
master
who
was
with
me
was
frozen
to
death
and
i
got
pneumonia
have
you
felt
any
effects
of
this
illness
since
no
no
fatigue
no
perspiration
at
night
no
when
i
tired
it
because
i
have
walked
a
lot
but
i
do
get
he
came
over
to
me
and
felt
my
arms
then
put
his
head
on
my
heart
then
at
my
back
and
on
my
chest
telling
me
to
take
deep
breaths
he
also
told
me
to
cough
that
done
he
looked
at
me
for
a
long
time
it
was
then
that
i
thought
he
wanted
to
bite
me
his
teeth
gleamed
in
such
a
terrible
smile
a
few
moments
later
he
left
the
house
with
my
father
what
did
it
mean
did
he
want
to
take
me
in
his
employ
i
should
have
to
leave
mattia
and
capi
no
i
would
be
a
servant
to
anybody
much
less
this
man
whom
i
disliked
already
my
father
returned
and
told
me
i
could
go
out
if
i
wished
i
went
into
the
caravan
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
mattia
there
he
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
go
and
open
the
stable
door
he
whispered
i
go
out
softly
behind
you
they
must
know
that
i
was
here
i
was
mystified
but
i
did
as
he
asked
do
you
know
who
that
man
was
who
was
with
your
father
he
asked
excitedly
when
we
were
in
the
street
it
was
james
milligan
your
friend
uncle
i
stood
staring
at
him
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
dragged
me
on
i
was
not
going
out
all
alone
he
continued
so
i
went
in
there
to
sleep
but
i
did
sleep
your
father
and
a
gentleman
came
into
the
stable
and
i
heard
all
they
said
at
first
i
did
try
to
listen
but
afterward
i
did
as
a
rock
said
the
gentleman
out
of
ten
would
have
died
but
he
pulled
through
with
pneumonia
is
your
nephew
asked
your
father
three
months
ago
the
doctors
again
gave
him
up
but
his
mother
saved
him
once
more
oh
she
a
marvelous
mother
is
mrs
milligan
you
can
imagine
when
i
heard
this
name
if
i
did
not
glue
my
ears
to
the
window
if
your
nephew
is
better
continued
your
father
done
is
useless
the
moment
perhaps
replied
the
other
i
do
say
that
arthur
is
going
to
live
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
he
did
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
miracles
the
day
he
dies
the
only
heir
to
that
estate
will
be
myself
worry
i
see
to
that
said
driscoll
i
count
on
you
replied
mr
milligan
my
first
thought
was
to
question
my
father
but
it
was
not
wise
to
let
them
know
that
they
had
been
overheard
as
milligan
had
business
with
my
father
he
would
probably
come
to
the
house
again
and
the
next
time
mattia
whom
he
did
not
know
could
follow
him
a
few
days
later
mattia
met
a
friend
of
his
bob
the
englishman
whom
he
had
known
at
the
gassot
circus
i
could
see
by
the
way
he
greeted
mattia
that
he
was
very
fond
of
him
he
at
once
took
a
liking
to
capi
and
myself
from
that
day
we
had
a
strong
friend
who
by
his
experience
and
advice
was
of
great
help
to
us
in
time
of
trouble
chapter
xxix
in
prison
spring
came
slowly
but
at
last
the
day
arrived
for
the
family
to
leave
london
the
caravans
had
been
repainted
and
were
loaded
with
merchandise
there
were
materials
hats
shawls
handkerchiefs
sweaters
underwear
razors
soap
powders
cream
everything
that
one
could
imagine
the
caravans
were
full
the
horses
bought
where
and
how
i
did
not
know
but
we
saw
them
come
and
everything
was
then
ready
for
the
departure
we
did
not
know
if
we
were
to
stay
with
the
old
grandfather
or
go
with
the
family
but
my
father
finding
that
we
made
good
money
playing
told
us
the
night
before
that
we
should
go
on
the
road
with
him
and
play
our
music
let
us
go
back
to
france
urged
mattia
here
a
good
chance
now
why
not
travel
through
england
because
i
tell
you
something
going
to
happen
if
we
stay
here
and
besides
we
might
find
milligan
and
arthur
in
france
if
he
has
been
ill
she
will
be
sure
to
take
him
on
their
barge
now
the
summer
is
coming
i
told
him
that
i
must
stay
the
same
day
we
started
i
saw
in
the
afternoon
how
they
sold
the
things
that
cost
so
little
we
arrived
at
a
large
village
and
the
caravans
were
drawn
up
on
the
public
square
one
of
the
sides
was
lowered
and
the
goods
displayed
temptingly
for
the
purchasers
to
inspect
look
at
the
price
look
at
the
price
cried
my
father
you
find
anything
like
this
elsewhere
for
the
price
i
do
sell
giving
away
look
at
this
he
must
have
stolen
them
i
heard
the
people
say
when
they
saw
the
prices
if
they
had
glanced
at
my
shamed
looks
they
would
have
known
that
they
were
right
in
their
suppositions
if
they
did
not
notice
me
mattia
did
how
much
longer
can
you
bear
this
he
asked
i
was
silent
let
us
go
back
to
france
he
urged
again
i
feel
that
something
is
going
to
happen
and
going
to
happen
soon
do
you
think
sooner
or
later
the
police
will
get
on
to
driscoll
seeing
how
cheap
he
selling
the
things
then
what
happen
oh
mattia
if
you
will
keep
your
eyes
shut
i
must
keep
mine
open
we
shall
both
be
arrested
and
we
have
done
anything
but
how
can
we
prove
that
we
eating
the
food
that
is
paid
for
by
the
money
that
he
gets
for
these
things
i
had
never
thought
of
that
it
struck
me
now
like
a
blow
in
the
face
but
we
earn
our
food
i
stammered
trying
to
defend
ourselves
that
true
but
we
living
with
thieves
replied
mattia
speaking
more
frankly
than
he
had
ever
done
before
and
then
if
we
sent
to
prison
we
ca
look
for
your
family
and
i
anxious
to
see
milligan
to
warn
her
against
that
james
milligan
you
do
know
what
he
might
not
do
to
arthur
let
us
go
while
we
can
let
me
have
a
few
more
days
to
think
it
over
mattia
i
said
hurry
up
then
jack
the
giant
killer
smelled
flesh
i
smell
danger
circumstances
did
for
me
what
i
was
afraid
to
do
several
weeks
had
passed
since
we
left
london
my
father
had
set
up
his
caravans
in
a
town
where
the
races
were
about
to
be
held
as
mattia
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
selling
the
goods
we
went
to
see
the
which
was
at
some
distance
from
the
town
outside
the
english
there
is
usually
a
fair
going
on
mountebanks
of
all
descriptions
musicians
and
stall
holders
gather
there
two
or
three
days
in
advance
we
were
passing
by
a
camp
fire
over
which
a
kettle
was
hanging
when
we
recognized
our
friend
bob
who
had
been
with
mattia
in
the
circus
he
was
delighted
to
see
us
again
he
had
come
to
the
races
with
two
friends
and
was
going
to
give
an
exhibition
of
strength
he
had
engaged
some
musicians
but
they
had
failed
him
at
the
last
moment
and
he
was
afraid
that
the
performance
the
next
day
would
be
a
failure
he
had
to
have
musicians
to
attract
a
crowd
would
we
help
him
out
the
profits
would
be
divided
between
the
five
of
us
that
made
up
the
company
there
would
even
be
something
for
capi
for
he
would
like
to
have
capi
perform
his
tricks
in
the
intervals
we
agreed
and
promised
to
be
there
the
next
day
at
the
time
he
mentioned
when
i
told
of
this
arrangement
to
my
father
he
said
that
he
wanted
capi
and
that
we
could
not
have
him
i
wondered
if
they
were
going
to
make
my
dog
do
some
dirty
trick
from
my
look
my
father
guessed
my
thoughts
oh
it
all
right
he
said
capi
a
good
watch
dog
he
must
stand
by
the
caravans
in
a
crowd
like
we
shall
have
we
might
easily
be
robbed
you
two
go
alone
and
play
with
your
friend
bob
and
if
you
are
not
finished
until
late
which
will
be
quite
likely
you
can
join
us
at
the
old
oak
tavern
we
shall
go
on
our
way
again
we
had
spent
the
night
before
at
the
old
oak
tavern
which
was
a
mile
out
on
a
lonely
road
the
place
was
kept
by
a
couple
whose
appearance
did
not
inspire
one
with
confidence
it
was
quite
easy
to
find
this
place
it
was
on
a
straight
road
the
only
annoying
thing
was
that
it
was
a
long
walk
for
us
after
a
tiring
day
but
when
my
father
said
a
thing
i
had
to
obey
i
promised
to
be
at
the
tavern
the
next
day
after
tying
capi
to
the
caravan
where
he
was
to
be
on
guard
i
hurried
off
to
the
with
mattia
we
began
to
play
as
soon
as
we
arrived
and
kept
it
up
until
night
my
fingers
ached
as
though
they
had
been
pricked
with
a
thousand
pins
and
poor
mattia
had
blown
his
cornet
so
long
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
it
was
past
midnight
just
as
they
were
doing
their
last
turn
a
big
bar
of
iron
which
they
were
using
in
their
feats
fell
on
mattia
foot
i
thought
that
his
foot
was
broken
fortunately
it
was
only
severely
bruised
no
bones
were
broken
but
still
he
could
not
walk
it
was
decided
that
he
should
stay
there
that
night
with
bob
and
that
i
should
go
on
alone
to
the
old
oak
tavern
for
i
had
to
know
where
the
driscoll
family
was
going
the
next
day
all
was
dark
when
i
reached
the
tavern
i
looked
round
for
the
caravans
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
all
i
could
see
beside
one
or
two
miserable
wagons
was
a
big
cage
from
which
as
i
drew
near
came
the
cry
of
a
wild
beast
the
beautiful
gaudy
colored
caravans
belonging
to
the
driscoll
family
were
gone
i
knocked
at
the
tavern
door
the
landlord
opened
it
and
turned
the
light
from
his
lantern
full
on
my
face
he
recognised
me
but
instead
of
letting
me
go
in
he
told
me
to
hurry
after
my
parents
who
had
gone
to
lewes
and
said
that
i
better
not
lose
any
time
joining
them
then
he
shut
the
door
in
my
face
since
i
had
been
in
england
i
had
learned
to
speak
english
fairly
well
i
understood
clearly
what
he
said
but
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
where
lewes
was
situated
and
besides
i
could
not
go
even
if
i
found
out
the
direction
and
leave
mattia
behind
i
began
my
weary
tramp
back
to
the
an
hour
later
i
was
sleeping
beside
mattia
in
wagon
the
next
morning
bob
told
me
how
to
get
to
lewes
and
i
was
ready
to
start
i
was
watching
him
boil
the
water
for
breakfast
when
i
looked
up
from
the
fire
and
saw
capi
being
led
towards
us
by
a
policeman
what
did
it
mean
the
moment
capi
recognized
me
he
gave
a
tug
at
his
leash
and
escaping
from
the
officer
bounded
toward
me
and
jumped
into
my
arms
is
that
your
dog
asked
the
policeman
yes
then
come
with
me
you
under
arrest
he
seized
me
by
the
collar
what
do
you
mean
by
arresting
him
cried
bob
jumping
up
from
the
fire
are
you
his
brother
no
his
friend
well
a
man
and
a
boy
robbed
george
church
last
night
they
got
up
a
ladder
and
went
through
the
window
this
dog
was
there
to
give
the
alarm
they
were
surprised
in
the
act
and
in
their
hurry
to
get
out
by
the
window
the
dog
was
left
in
the
church
i
knew
that
with
the
dog
be
sure
to
find
the
thieves
here
one
now
where
his
father
i
could
not
utter
a
word
mattia
who
had
heard
the
talk
came
out
of
the
caravan
and
limped
over
to
me
bob
was
telling
the
policeman
that
i
could
not
be
guilty
because
i
had
stayed
with
him
until
one
then
i
went
to
the
old
oak
tavern
and
spoke
to
the
landlord
there
and
came
back
here
at
once
it
was
a
quarter
after
one
that
the
church
was
entered
said
the
officer
and
this
boy
left
here
at
one
so
he
could
have
met
the
other
and
got
to
the
church
it
takes
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
go
from
here
to
the
town
said
bob
on
the
run
no
replied
the
policeman
and
what
proves
that
he
left
here
at
one
i
can
prove
it
i
swear
it
cried
bob
the
policeman
shrugged
his
shoulders
this
boy
can
explain
to
the
magistrate
he
said
as
i
was
being
led
away
mattia
threw
his
arms
about
my
neck
as
though
it
was
because
he
wanted
to
embrace
me
but
mattia
had
another
object
keep
up
your
courage
he
whispered
we
wo
forsake
you
take
care
of
capi
i
said
in
french
but
the
officer
understood
oh
no
he
said
i
keep
that
dog
he
helped
me
to
find
you
he
may
help
me
to
find
the
other
handcuffed
to
the
policeman
i
had
to
pass
under
the
gaze
of
a
crowd
of
people
but
they
did
not
jeer
me
like
the
peasants
in
france
had
done
at
my
first
arrest
these
people
almost
all
of
them
were
antagonistic
to
the
police
they
were
gypsies
tramps
in
fact
the
bohemian
vagabond
there
were
no
onions
strewn
over
this
prison
where
i
was
now
locked
up
this
was
a
real
jail
with
iron
bars
at
the
windows
the
sight
of
which
put
all
thought
of
escape
from
my
mind
in
the
cell
there
was
only
a
bench
and
a
hammock
i
dropped
onto
the
bench
and
remained
for
a
long
time
with
my
head
buried
in
my
hands
mattia
and
bob
even
with
the
help
of
other
friends
could
never
get
me
away
from
here
i
got
up
and
went
over
to
the
window
the
bars
were
strong
and
close
together
the
walls
were
three
feet
thick
the
ground
beneath
was
paved
with
large
stones
the
door
was
covered
with
a
plate
of
sheet
iron
no
i
could
not
escape
i
began
to
wonder
if
it
would
be
possible
for
me
to
prove
my
innocence
despite
capi
presence
in
the
church
mattia
and
bob
could
help
me
by
proving
an
alibi
if
they
could
prove
this
i
was
saved
in
spite
of
the
mute
testimony
that
my
poor
dog
had
carried
against
me
i
asked
the
jailer
when
he
brought
in
some
food
if
it
would
be
long
before
i
should
appear
before
the
magistrate
i
did
not
know
then
that
in
england
you
are
taken
into
court
the
day
after
arrest
the
jailer
who
seemed
a
kindly
sort
of
man
told
me
that
it
would
certainly
be
the
next
day
i
had
heard
tales
of
prisoners
finding
messages
from
their
friends
in
the
food
that
was
brought
in
to
them
i
could
not
touch
my
food
but
i
at
once
began
to
crumble
my
bread
i
found
nothing
inside
there
were
some
potatoes
also
i
mashed
them
to
a
pulp
but
i
found
not
the
tiniest
note
i
did
not
sleep
that
night
the
next
morning
the
jailer
came
into
my
cell
carrying
a
jug
of
water
and
a
basin
he
told
me
to
wash
myself
if
i
wished
to
for
i
was
to
appear
before
the
judge
and
a
good
appearance
never
went
against
one
when
the
jailer
returned
he
told
me
to
follow
him
we
went
down
several
passages
then
came
to
a
small
door
which
he
opened
pass
in
he
said
the
room
i
entered
was
very
close
i
heard
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
although
my
temples
were
throbbing
and
i
could
scarcely
stand
i
was
able
to
take
in
my
surroundings
the
room
was
of
fair
size
with
large
windows
and
high
ceiling
the
judge
was
seated
on
a
raised
platform
beneath
him
in
front
sat
three
other
court
officials
near
where
i
stood
was
a
gentleman
wearing
a
robe
and
wig
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
this
was
my
lawyer
how
was
it
i
had
an
attorney
where
did
he
come
from
amongst
the
witnesses
i
saw
bob
and
his
two
friends
the
landlord
of
the
old
oak
tavern
and
some
men
whom
i
did
not
know
then
on
another
stand
opposite
amongst
several
other
persons
i
saw
the
policeman
who
had
arrested
me
the
public
prosecutor
in
a
few
words
stated
the
crime
a
robbery
had
been
committed
in
george
church
the
thieves
a
man
and
a
child
had
climbed
up
a
ladder
and
broken
a
window
to
get
in
they
had
with
them
a
dog
to
give
the
alarm
at
a
quarter
after
one
a
late
pedestrian
had
seen
a
light
in
the
church
and
had
at
once
aroused
the
sexton
several
men
ran
to
the
church
the
dog
barked
and
the
thieves
escaped
through
the
window
leaving
the
dog
behind
them
the
intelligence
was
remarkable
the
next
morning
the
animal
had
led
the
policeman
to
the
where
he
had
recognized
his
master
who
was
none
other
than
the
accused
now
standing
in
the
prisoner
dock
as
to
the
second
thief
they
were
on
his
trail
and
they
hoped
to
arrest
him
shortly
there
was
little
to
be
said
for
me
my
friends
tried
to
prove
an
alibi
but
the
prosecutor
said
that
i
had
ample
time
to
meet
my
accomplice
at
the
church
and
then
run
to
the
old
oak
tavern
after
i
was
asked
then
how
i
could
account
for
my
dog
being
in
the
church
at
quarter
after
one
i
replied
that
i
could
not
say
for
the
dog
had
not
been
with
me
all
day
but
i
declared
that
i
was
innocent
my
attorney
tried
to
prove
that
my
dog
had
wandered
into
the
church
during
the
day
and
had
been
locked
in
when
the
sexton
closed
the
door
he
did
his
best
for
me
but
the
defense
was
weak
then
the
judge
said
that
i
should
be
taken
to
the
county
jail
to
wait
for
the
grand
jury
to
decide
if
i
should
or
should
not
be
held
for
the
assizes
the
assizes
i
fell
back
on
my
bench
oh
why
had
i
not
listened
to
mattia
chapter
xxx
escape
i
had
not
been
acquitted
because
the
judge
was
expecting
the
arrest
of
the
man
who
had
entered
the
church
with
the
child
they
would
then
know
if
i
was
this
man
accomplice
they
were
on
the
trail
the
prosecutor
had
said
so
i
should
have
the
shame
and
sorrow
of
appearing
in
the
prisoner
dock
at
the
assizes
beside
that
evening
just
before
dusk
i
heard
the
clear
notes
of
a
cornet
mattia
was
there
dear
old
mattia
he
wanted
to
tell
me
that
he
was
near
and
thinking
of
me
he
was
evidently
in
the
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
opposite
my
window
i
heard
footsteps
and
the
murmur
of
a
crowd
mattia
and
bob
were
probably
giving
a
performance
suddenly
i
heard
a
clear
voice
call
out
in
french
at
daybreak
then
at
once
mattia
played
his
loudest
on
the
cornet
it
did
not
need
any
degree
of
intelligence
to
understand
that
mattia
had
not
addressed
these
french
words
to
an
english
public
i
was
not
sure
what
they
meant
but
evidently
i
had
to
be
on
the
alert
at
daybreak
the
next
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
i
got
into
my
hammock
but
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
go
to
sleep
although
i
was
very
tired
at
last
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
when
i
awoke
it
was
night
the
stars
shone
in
the
dark
sky
and
silence
reigned
everywhere
a
clock
struck
three
i
counted
the
hours
and
the
quarter
hours
leaning
against
the
wall
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
window
i
watched
the
stars
go
out
one
by
one
in
the
distance
i
could
hear
the
cocks
crowing
it
was
daybreak
i
opened
the
window
very
softly
what
did
i
expect
there
were
still
the
iron
bars
and
the
high
wall
opposite
i
could
not
get
out
and
yet
foolish
though
the
thought
was
i
expected
my
freedom
the
morning
air
chilled
me
but
i
stayed
by
my
window
looking
out
without
knowing
at
what
listening
without
knowing
to
what
a
big
white
cloud
came
up
in
the
sky
it
was
daybreak
my
heart
throbbed
wildly
then
i
seemed
to
hear
a
scratching
on
the
wall
but
i
had
heard
no
sound
of
footsteps
i
listened
the
scratching
continued
i
saw
a
head
appear
above
the
wall
in
the
dim
light
i
recognized
bob
he
saw
me
with
my
face
pressed
against
the
bars
silence
he
said
softly
he
made
a
sign
for
me
to
move
away
from
the
window
wondering
i
obeyed
he
put
a
peashooter
to
his
mouth
and
blew
a
tiny
ball
came
through
the
air
and
fell
at
my
feet
bob
head
disappeared
i
pounced
on
the
ball
it
was
tissue
paper
made
into
a
tiny
ball
like
a
pea
the
light
was
too
dim
for
me
to
see
what
was
written
on
it
i
had
to
wait
till
day
i
closed
my
window
cautiously
and
lay
down
again
in
my
hammock
with
the
tiny
bit
of
paper
in
my
hand
how
slowly
the
light
came
at
last
i
was
able
to
read
what
was
written
on
the
paper

good
mattia
dear
old
bob
how
good
of
bob
to
help
mattia

mattia
poor
little
fellow
could
not
have
done
this
alone
i
the
note
forty
minutes
after
the
train
starts
hill
to
the
left
it
was
a
risky
thing
to
do
to
jump
from
a
train
but
even
if
i
killed
myself
in
doing
so
i
would
better
do
it
better
die
than
be
condemned
as
a
thief
would
they
think
of
capi
after
i
had
again
read
my
note
i
chewed
it
into
a
pulp
the
next
day
in
the
afternoon
a
policeman
came
into
my
cell
and
told
me
to
follow
him
he
was
a
man
over
fifty
and
i
thought
with
satisfaction
that
he
did
not
appear
to
be
very
nimble
things
turned
out
just
as
bob
had
said
the
train
rolled
off
i
took
my
place
near
the
door
where
i
had
entered
the
policeman
sat
opposite
me
we
were
alone
in
the
compartment
do
you
speak
english
asked
the
policeman
i
understand
if
you
do
talk
too
rapidly
i
replied
well
then
i
want
to
give
you
a
little
advice
my
boy
he
said
do
try
and
fool
the
law
just
tell
me
how
it
all
happened
and
give
you
five
shillings
it
be
easier
for
you
if
you
have
a
little
money
in
jail
i
was
about
to
say
that
i
had
nothing
to
confess
but
i
felt
that
might
annoy
the
man
so
i
said
nothing
just
think
it
over
he
continued
and
when
you
in
jail
do
go
and
tell
the
first
comer
but
send
for
me
it
is
better
to
have
one
who
is
interested
in
you
and
i
very
willing
to
help
you
i
nodded
my
head
ask
for
dolphin
you
remember
my
name
yes
sir
i
was
leaning
against
the
door
the
window
was
down
and
the
air
blew
in
the
policeman
found
that
there
was
too
much
air
so
he
moved
into
the
middle
of
the
seat
my
left
hand
stole
softly
outside
and
turned
the
handle
with
my
right
hand
i
held
the
door
the
minutes
passed
the
engine
whistled
and
slackened
its
speed
the
moment
had
come
i
pushed
open
the
door
quickly
and
sprang
out
as
far
as
i
could
fortunately
my
hands
which
i
held
out
before
me
touched
the
grass
yet
the
shock
was
so
great
that
i
rolled
on
the
ground
unconscious
when
i
came
to
my
senses
i
thought
that
i
was
still
in
the
train
for
i
felt
myself
being
carried
along
looking
round
i
saw
that
i
was
lying
at
the
bottom
of
a
cart
strange
my
cheeks
were
wet
a
soft
warm
tongue
was
licking
me
i
turned
slightly
an
ugly
yellow
dog
was
leaning
over
me
mattia
was
kneeling
beside
me
you
saved
he
said
pushing
aside
the
dog
where
am
i
you
are
in
a
cart
bob
driving
how
goes
it
cried
bob
from
his
seat
can
you
move
your
arms
and
legs
i
stretched
out
and
did
what
he
asked
good
said
mattia
nothing
broken
what
happened
you
jumped
from
the
train
as
we
told
you
but
the
shock
stunned
you
and
you
rolled
into
a
ditch
when
you
did
come
bob
left
the
cart
crept
down
the
hill
and
carried
you
back
in
his
arms
we
thought
you
were
dead
oh
remi
i
was
afraid
i
stroked
his
hand
and
the
policeman
i
asked
the
train
went
on
it
did
stop
my
eyes
again
fell
on
the
ugly
yellow
dog
that
was
looking
at
me
with
eyes
that
resembled
capi
but
capi
was
white
what
dog
is
that
i
asked
before
mattia
could
reply
the
ugly
little
animal
had
jumped
on
me
licking
me
furiously
and
whining
it
capi
we
dyed
him
cried
mattia
laughing
dyed
him
why
so
that
he
would
be
recognized
now
bob
wants
to
make
you
more
comfortable
while
bob
and
mattia
were
making
me
comfortable
i
asked
them
where
we
were
going
to
little
hampton
said
mattia
where
bob
brother
has
a
boat
that
goes
over
to
france
to
fetch
butter
and
eggs
from
normandy
we
owe
everything
to
bob
what
could
a
poor
little
wretch
like
me
have
done
alone
it
was
bob
idea
that
you
jump
from
the
train
and
capi
who
idea
was
it
to
get
him
mine
but
it
was
bob
to
paint
him
yellow
so
that
he
would
be
recognized
after
we
stole
him
from
policeman
jerry
the
judge
called
jerry
he
was
so
very
intelligent
to
let
us
get
capi
away
true
capi
smelled
me
and
almost
got
off
alone
bob
knows
the
tricks
of
dog
thieves
and
your
foot
better
or
almost
better
i
have
had
time
to
think
of
it
night
was
falling
we
had
still
a
long
distance
to
go
are
you
afraid
asked
mattia
as
i
lay
there
in
silence
no
not
afraid
i
answered
for
i
do
think
that
i
shall
be
caught
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
running
away
i
admit
my
guilt
that
worries
me
better
anything
bob
and
i
thought
than
that
you
should
appear
at
the
assizes
even
if
you
got
off
it
a
bad
thing
to
have
gone
through
convinced
that
after
the
train
stopped
the
policeman
would
lose
no
time
looking
for
me
we
went
ahead
as
quickly
as
possible
the
villages
through
which
we
drove
were
very
quiet
lights
were
seen
in
only
a
few
of
the
windows
mattia
and
i
got
under
a
cover
for
some
time
a
cold
wind
had
been
blowing
and
when
we
passed
our
tongues
over
our
lips
we
tasted
salt
we
were
nearing
the
sea
soon
we
saw
a
light
flashing
every
now
and
again
it
was
a
lighthouse
suddenly
bob
stopped
his
horse
and
jumping
down
from
the
cart
told
us
to
wait
there
he
was
going
to
see
his
brother
to
ask
him
if
it
would
be
safe
for
him
to
take
us
on
his
boat
bob
seemed
to
be
away
a
very
long
time
we
did
not
speak
we
could
hear
the
waves
breaking
on
the
shore
at
a
short
distance
mattia
was
trembling
and
i
also
it
is
cold
he
whispered
was
it
the
cold
that
made
us
shake
when
a
cow
or
a
sheep
in
the
field
at
the
side
touched
against
the
fence
we
trembled
still
more
there
were
footsteps
on
the
road
bob
was
returning
my
fate
had
been
decided
a
sailor
wearing
a
and
an
oilskin
hat
was
with
bob
this
is
my
brother
said
bob
he
take
you
on
his
boat
so
have
to
part
now
no
one
need
know
that
i
brought
you
here
i
wanted
to
thank
bob
but
he
cut
me
short
i
grasped
his
hand
do
speak
of
it
he
said
lightly
you
two
boys
helped
me
out
the
other
night
one
good
turn
deserves
another
and
i
pleased
to
have
been
able
to
help
a
friend
of
mattia
we
followed
bob
brother
down
some
winding
quiet
streets
till
we
came
to
the
docks
he
pointed
to
a
boat
without
saying
a
word
in
a
few
moments
we
were
on
board
he
told
us
to
go
down
below
into
a
little
cabin
i
start
in
two
hours
time
he
said
stay
there
and
do
make
a
sound
but
we
were
not
trembling
now
we
sat
in
the
dark
side
by
side
chapter
xxxi
hunting
for
the
swan
for
some
time
after
bob
brother
left
we
heard
only
the
noise
of
the
wind
and
the
sea
dashing
against
the
keel
then
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
deck
above
and
the
grinding
of
pulleys
a
sail
was
hoisted
then
suddenly
the
boat
leaned
to
one
side
and
began
to
rock
in
a
few
moments
it
was
pitching
heavily
on
the
rough
sea
poor
mattia
i
said
taking
his
hand
i
do
care
we
saved
he
said
what
if
i
am
seasick
the
next
day
i
passed
my
time
between
the
cabin
and
deck
mattia
wanted
to
be
left
alone
when
at
last
the
skipper
pointed
out
harfleur
i
hurried
down
to
the
cabin
to
tell
him
the
good
news
as
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
we
arrived
at
harfleur
bob
brother
told
us
that
we
could
sleep
on
the
boat
that
night
if
we
wished
when
you
want
to
go
back
to
england
he
said
the
next
morning
as
we
wished
him
and
thanked
him
for
what
he
had
done
for
us
just
remember
that
the
sails
from
here
every
tuesday
it
was
a
kind
invitation
but
mattia
and
i
each
of
us
had
our
reason
for
not
wishing
to
cross
the
sea
again
yet
awhile
fortunately
we
had
our
profits
from
bob
performance
in
all
we
had
francs
and
fifty
centimes
mattia
wanted
to
give
bob
the
francs
in
payment
for
the
expenses
he
had
been
put
to
for
my
flight
but
he
would
not
accept
a
penny
well
which
way
shall
we
go
i
asked
when
we
landed
in
france
by
the
canal
replied
mattia
promptly
because
i
have
an
idea
i
believe
the
is
on
the
canal
this
summer
now
that
arthur
been
so
ill
and
i
think
we
ought
to
find
it
he
added
but
what
about
lise
and
the
others
i
asked
we
see
them
while
we
looking
for
milligan
as
we
go
up
the
canal
we
can
stop
and
see
lise
with
a
map
that
we
bought
we
searched
for
the
nearest
river
it
was
the
seine
we
go
up
the
seine
and
ask
all
the
fishermen
along
the
banks
if
they
seen
the
it
is
like
any
other
boat
from
what
you
say
and
if
they
seen
it
they
remember
before
beginning
the
long
journey
that
was
probably
ahead
of
us
i
bought
some
soft
soap
to
clean
capi
to
me
capi
yellow
was
not
capi
we
washed
him
thoroughly
each
one
taking
it
in
turns
until
he
was
tired
out
but
bob
dye
was
an
excellent
quality
and
when
we
had
finished
he
was
still
yellow
but
a
shade
paler
it
would
require
many
shampoos
before
we
could
get
him
back
to
his
original
color
fortunately
normandy
is
a
country
of
brooks
and
each
day
we
gave
him
a
bath
we
reached
the
top
of
a
hill
one
morning
and
mattia
spied
the
seine
away
ahead
of
us
winding
in
a
large
curve
from
then
on
we
began
to
question
the
people
had
they
seen
the
a
beautiful
barge
with
a
veranda
no
one
had
seen
it
it
must
have
passed
in
the
night
we
went
on
to
rouen
where
again
we
commenced
our
questions
but
with
no
better
result
we
would
not
be
discouraged
but
went
forward
questioning
every
one
we
had
to
stop
to
get
money
for
our
food
as
we
went
along
so
it
took
us
five
weeks
to
reach
the
suburbs
of
paris
fortunately
upon
arriving
at
charenton
we
soon
knew
which
direction
we
had
to
take
when
we
put
the
important
question
we
received
for
the
first
time
the
answer
for
which
we
had
longed
a
boat
which
resembled
the
a
large
pleasure
boat
had
passed
that
way
turning
to
the
left
it
had
continued
up
the
seine
we
were
by
the
docks
mattia
was
so
overjoyed
that
he
commenced
to
dance
amongst
the
fishermen
stopping
suddenly
he
took
his
violin
and
frantically
played
a
triumphal
march
while
he
played
i
questioned
the
man
who
had
seen
the
barge
without
a
doubt
it
was
the
it
had
passed
through
charenton
about
two
months
ago
two
months
what
a
lead
it
had
but
what
did
that
matter
we
had
our
legs
and
they
had
the
legs
of
two
good
horses
and
we
should
join
them
some
day
the
question
of
time
did
not
count
the
great
thing
the
wonderful
thing
was
that
the
was
found
who
was
right
cried
mattia
if
i
had
dared
i
would
have
admitted
to
mattia
that
i
had
very
great
hopes
but
i
felt
that
i
could
not
analyze
my
thoughts
not
even
to
myself
we
had
no
need
to
stop
now
and
question
the
people
the
was
ahead
of
us
we
had
only
to
follow
the
seine
we
went
on
our
way
getting
nearer
to
where
lise
lived
i
wondered
if
she
had
seen
the
barge
as
it
passed
through
the
locks
by
her
home
at
night
we
never
complained
of
weariness
and
we
were
always
ready
the
next
morning
to
set
out
at
an
early
hour
wake
me
up
said
mattia
who
was
fond
of
sleeping
and
when
i
woke
him
he
was
never
long
in
jumping
to
his
feet
to
economize
we
ate
eggs
which
we
bought
from
the
grocers
and
bread
yet
mattia
was
very
fond
of
good
things
i
hope
milligan
has
that
cook
still
who
made
those
tarts
he
said
apricot
tarts
must
be
fine
have
you
ever
tasted
them
i
tasted
apple
puffs
but
i
never
tasted
apricot
tarts
i
seen
them
what
are
those
little
white
things
they
stick
all
over
the
fruit
almonds
oh
and
mattia
opened
his
mouth
as
though
he
were
swallowing
a
whole
tart
at
each
lock
we
had
news
of
the
every
one
had
seen
the
beautiful
barge
and
they
spoke
of
the
kind
english
lady
and
the
little
boy
lying
on
a
sofa
under
the
veranda
we
drew
nearer
to
lise
home
two
more
days
then
one
then
only
a
few
hours
we
came
in
sight
of
the
house
we
were
not
walking
now
we
were
running
capi
who
seemed
to
know
where
we
were
going
started
ahead
at
a
gallop
he
was
going
to
let
lise
know
that
we
were
coming
she
would
come
to
meet
us
but
when
we
got
to
the
house
there
was
a
woman
standing
at
the
door
whom
we
did
not
know
where
madame
suriot
we
inquired
for
a
moment
she
stared
at
us
as
though
we
were
asking
a
foolish
question
she
does
live
here
now
she
said
at
last
she
in
egypt
in
egypt
mattia
and
i
looked
at
one
another
in
amazement
egypt
we
did
not
know
just
where
egypt
was
situated
but
we
thought
vaguely
it
was
far
away
very
far
somewhere
beyond
the
seas
and
lise
do
you
know
lise
the
little
dumb
girl
yes
i
know
her
she
went
off
with
an
english
lady
on
a
barge
lise
on
the
were
we
dreaming
mattia
and
i
stared
at
one
another
are
you
remi
then
asked
the
woman
yes
well
suriot
was
drowned
drowned
yes
he
fell
into
the
lock
and
got
caught
below
on
a
nail
and
his
poor
wife
did
know
what
to
do
and
then
a
lady
that
she
lived
with
before
she
married
was
going
to
egypt
and
she
told
her
she
would
take
her
as
nurse
to
look
after
the
children
she
did
know
what
to
do
with
little
lise
and
while
she
was
wondering
an
english
lady
and
her
little
sick
son
came
along
the
canal
in
a
barge
they
talked
and
the
english
lady
who
was
looking
for
some
one
to
play
with
her
son
for
he
was
tired
of
being
always
alone
said
she
would
take
lise
along
and
she
would
educate
the
little
girl
the
lady
said
she
would
have
doctors
who
would
cure
her
and
she
would
be
able
to
speak
some
day
before
they
went
lise
wanted
her
aunt
to
explain
to
me
what
i
was
to
say
to
you
if
you
came
to
see
her
that
all
i
was
so
amazed
that
i
could
find
no
words
but
mattia
never
lost
his
head
like
me
where
did
the
english
lady

he
asked
to
switzerland
lise
was
to
have
written
to

so
that
i
could
give

address
but
i
have
received
the
letter
yet
chapter
xxxii
finding
a
real
mother
forward
march
children
cried
mattia
after
we
had
thanked
the
woman
it
is
not
only
arthur
and
milligan
now
that
we
are
going
after
but
lise
what
luck
who
knows
what
in
store
for
us
we
went
on
our
way
in
search
of
the
only
stopping
just
to
sleep
and
to
earn
a
few
sous
from
switzerland
one
goes
to
italy
said
mattia
softly
if
while
running
after
milligan
we
get
to
lucca
how
happy
my
little
christina
will
be
poor
dear
mattia
he
was
helping
me
to
seek
those
i
loved
and
i
had
done
nothing
to
help
him
see
his
little
sister
at
lyons
we
gained
on
the
it
was
now
only
six
weeks
ahead
of
us
i
doubted
if
we
could
catch
up
with
it
before
it
reached
switzerland
and
then
i
did
not
know
that
the
river
rhone
was
not
navigable
up
to
the
lake
of
geneva
we
had
thought
that
milligan
would
go
right
to
switzerland
on
her
boat
what
was
my
surprise
when
arriving
at
the
next
town
to
see
the
in
the
distance
we
began
to
run
along
the
banks
of
the
river
what
was
the
matter
everything
was
closed
up
on
the
barge
there
were
no
flowers
on
the
veranda
what
had
happened
to
arthur
we
stopped
looking
at
each
other
both
with
the
same
sorrowful
thoughts
a
man
who
had
charge
of
the
boat
told
us
that
the
english
lady
had
gone
to
switzerland
with
a
sick
boy
and
a
little
dumb
girl
they
had
gone
in
a
carriage
with
a
maid
the
other
servants
had
followed
with
the
baggage
we
breathed
again
where
is
the
lady
asked
mattia
she
has
taken
a
villa
at
vevy
but
i
can
not
say
where
she
is
going
to
spend
the
summer
there
we
started
for
vevy
now
they
were
not
traveling
away
from
us
they
had
stopped
and
we
should
be
sure
to
find
them
at
vevy
if
we
searched
we
arrived
there
with
three
sous
in
our
pockets
and
the
soles
off
our
boots
but
vevy
is
not
a
little
village
it
is
a
town
and
as
for
asking
for
milligan
or
even
an
english
lady
with
a
sick
son
and
a
dumb
girl
we
knew
that
that
would
be
absurd
there
are
so
many
english
in
vevy
the
place
is
almost
like
an
english
pleasure
resort
the
best
way
we
thought
was
to
go
to
all
the
houses
where
they
might
be
likely
to
live
that
would
not
be
difficult
we
had
only
to
play
our
music
in
every
street
we
tried
everywhere
but
yet
we
could
see
no
signs
of
milligan
we
went
from
the
lake
to
the
mountains
from
the
mountains
to
the
lake
looking
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
questioning
from
time
to
time
people
who
from
their
expression
we
thought
would
be
disposed
to
listen
and
reply
some
one
sent
us
to
a
chalet
built
way
up
on
the
mountain
another
assured
us
that
she
lived
down
by
the
lake
they
were
indeed
english
ladies
who
lived
up
in
the
chalet
on
the
mountain
and
the
villa
down
by
the
lake
but
not
our
milligan
one
afternoon
we
were
playing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
the
house
before
us
had
a
large
iron
gate
the
house
behind
stood
way
back
in
a
garden
in
the
front
of
it
there
was
a
stone
wall
i
was
singing
my
loudest
i
sung
the
first
verse
of
my
neapolitan
song
and
was
about
to
commence
the
second
when
we
heard
a
weak
strange
voice
singing
who
could
it
be
what
a
strange
voice
arthur
inquired
mattia
no
no
it
is
not
arthur
i
have
never
heard
that
voice
before
but
capi
commenced
to
whine
and
gave
every
sign
of
intense
joy
while
jumping
against
the
wall
who
is
singing
i
cried
unable
to
contain
myself
remi
called
a
weak
voice
my
name
instead
of
an
answer
mattia
and
i
looked
at
one
another
thunderstruck
as
we
stood
looking
stupidly
into
each
other
faces
i
saw
a
handkerchief
being
waved
at
the
end
of
the
wall
we
ran
to
the
spot
it
was
not
until
we
got
to
the
hedge
which
surrounded
the
other
side
of
the
garden
that
we
saw
the
one
who
was
waving
lise
at
last
we
had
found
her
and
not
far
away
were
milligan
and
arthur
but
who
had
sung
that
was
the
question
that
mattia
and
i
asked
as
soon
as
we
found
words
i
answered
lise
lise
was
singing
lise
was
talking
the
doctors
had
said
that
one
day
lise
would
recover
her
speech
and
very
probably
under
the
shock
of
a
violent
emotion
but
i
did
not
think
that
it
could
be
possible
and
yet
the
miracle
had
happened
and
it
was
upon
knowing
that
i
had
come
to
her
and
hearing
me
sing
the
neapolitan
song
i
used
to
sing
to
her
that
she
had
felt
this
intense
emotion
and
was
restored
to
her
voice
i
was
so
overcome
at
this
thought
that
i
had
to
stretch
out
my
hand
to
steady
myself
where
is
mrs
milligan
i
asked
and
arthur
lise
moved
her
lips
but
she
could
only
utter
inarticulate
sounds
then
impatiently
she
used
the
language
of
her
hands
for
her
tongue
was
still
clumsy
in
forming
words
she
pointed
down
the
garden
and
we
saw
arthur
lying
in
an
invalid
chair
on
one
side
of
him
was
his
mother
and
on
the
other
james
milligan
in
fear
in
fact
almost
terror
i
stooped
down
behind
the
hedge
lise
must
have
wondered
why
i
did
so
then
i
made
a
sign
to
her
to
go
go
lise
or
you
betray
me
i
said
come
here
at
nine
and
be
alone
then
i
can
talk
to
you
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
went
up
the
garden
we
ought
not
to
wait
till
to
speak
to
milligan
said
mattia
in
the
meantime
that
uncle
might
kill
arthur
he
has
never
seen
me
and
i
going
to
see
milligan
at
once
and
tell
her
there
was
some
reason
in
what
mattia
proposed
so
i
let
him
go
off
telling
him
that
i
would
wait
for
him
at
a
short
distance
under
a
big
chestnut
tree
i
waited
a
long
time
for
mattia
more
than
a
dozen
times
i
wondered
if
i
had
not
made
a
mistake
in
letting
him
go
at
last
i
saw
him
coming
back
accompanied
by
milligan
i
ran
to
her
and
seizing
the
hand
that
she
held
out
to
me
i
bent
over
it
but
she
put
her
arms
round
me
and
stooping
down
kissed
me
tenderly
on
the
forehead
poor
dear
child
she
murmured
with
her
beautiful
white
fingers
she
pushed
the
hair
back
from
my
forehead
and
looked
at
me
for
a
long
time
yes
yes
she
whispered
softly
i
was
too
happy
to
say
a
word
mattia
and
i
have
had
a
long
talk
she
said
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
yourself
how
you
came
to
enter
the
driscoll
family
i
told
her
what
she
asked
and
she
only
interrupted
me
to
tell
me
to
be
exact
on
certain
points
never
had
i
been
listened
to
with
such
attention
her
eyes
did
not
leave
mine
when
i
had
finished
she
was
silent
for
some
time
still
looking
at
me
at
last
she
said
this
is
a
very
serious
matter
and
we
must
act
prudently
but
from
this
moment
you
must
consider
yourself
as
the
friend
she
hesitated
a
little
as
the
brother
of
arthur
in
two
hours
time
go
to
the
hotel
des
alpes
for
the
time
being
you
will
stay
there
i
will
send
some
one
to
the
hotel
to
meet
you
i
am
obliged
to
leave
you
now
again
she
kissed
me
and
after
having
shaken
hands
with
mattia
she
walked
away
quickly
what
did
you
tell
mrs
milligan
i
demanded
of
mattia
all
that
i
have
said
to
you
and
a
lot
more
things
he
replied
ah
she
is
a
kind
lady
a
beautiful
lady
did
you
see
arthur
only
from
a
distance
but
near
enough
to
see
that
he
looked
a
nice
sort
of
boy
i
continued
to
question
mattia
but
he
answered
me
vaguely
although
we
were
in
our
ragged
street
suits
we
were
received
at
the
hotel
by
a
servant
in
a
black
suit
and
a
white
tie
he
took
us
to
our
apartment
how
beautiful
we
thought
our
bedroom
there
were
two
white
beds
side
by
side
the
windows
opened
onto
a
balcony
overlooking
the
lake
the
servant
asked
us
what
we
would
like
for
dinner
which
he
would
serve
us
on
the
balcony
if
we
wished
have
you
any
tarts
asked
mattia
yes
rhubarb
tarts
strawberry
tarts
and
gooseberry
tarts
good
then
you
can
serve
these
tarts
all
three
certainly
and
what
entr√©e
what
meat
vegetables
at
each
offer
mattia
opened
his
eyes
but
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
disconcerted
anything
just
what
you
like
he
replied
coolly
the
butler
left
the
room
gravely
the
next
day
milligan
came
to
see
us
she
was
accompanied
by
a
tailor
and
a
shirt
maker
who
took
our
measures
for
some
suits
and
shirts
milligan
told
us
that
lise
was
still
trying
to
talk
and
that
the
doctor
had
declared
that
she
would
soon
be
cured
then
after
having
spent
an
hour
with
us
she
left
us
again
kissing
me
tenderly
and
shaking
hands
warmly
with
mattia
for
four
days
she
came
each
time
she
was
more
affectionate
and
loving
to
me
yet
still
with
a
certain
restraint
the
fifth
day
the
maid
whom
i
had
known
on
the
came
in
her
place
she
told
us
that
milligan
was
expecting
us
and
that
a
carriage
was
at
the
hotel
doors
to
take
us
to
her
mattia
took
his
seat
in
the
brougham
as
though
he
had
been
used
to
riding
in
a
carriage
all
his
life
capi
also
jumped
in
without
any
embarrassment
and
sat
down
on
the
velvet
cushions
the
drive
was
short
it
seemed
to
me
very
short
for
i
was
like
one
in
a
dream
my
head
filled
with
foolish
ideas
or
at
least
what
i
thought
might
be
foolish
we
were
shown
into
a
milligan
arthur
and
lise
were
there
arthur
held
out
his
arms
i
rushed
over
to
him
then
i
kissed
lise
milligan
kissed
me
at
last
she
said
the
day
has
come
when
you
can
take
the
place
that
belongs
to
you
i
looked
to
her
to
ask
her
to
explain
she
went
over
to
a
door
and
opened
it
then
came
the
grand
surprise
mother
barberin
entered
in
her
arms
she
carried
some
baby
clothes
a
white
cashmere
pelisse
a
lace
bonnet
some
woolen
shoes
she
had
only
time
to
put
these
things
on
the
table
before
i
was
hugging
her
while
i
fondled
her
milligan
gave
an
order
to
the
servant
i
heard
only
the
name
of
milligan
but
i
looked
up
quickly
i
know
that
i
turned
pale
you
have
nothing
to
fear
said
milligan
gently
come
over
here
and
place
your
hand
in
mine
james
milligan
came
into
the
room
smiling
and
showing
his
white
pointed
teeth
when
he
saw
me
the
smile
turned
to
a
horrible
grimace
milligan
did
not
give
him
time
to
speak
i
asked
for
you
to
come
here
she
said
her
voice
shaking
to
introduce
you
to
my
eldest
son
whom
i
have
at
last
found
she
pressed
my
hand
but
you
have
met
him
already
you
saw
him
at
the
home
of
the
man
who
stole
him
when
you
went
there
to
inquire
after
his
health
what
does
this
mean
demanded
milligan
that
the
man
who
is
serving
a
sentence
for
robbing
a
church
has
made
a
full
confession
he
has
stated
how
he
stole
my
baby
and
took
it
to
paris
and
left
it
there
here

the
clothes
that
my
child
wore

was
this
good
woman
who
brought
up
my
son
do
you
wish
to
read
this
confession
do
you
wish
to
examine
these
clothes
james
milligan
looked
at
us
as
though
he
would
liked
to
have
strangled
us
then
he
turned
on
his
heels
at
the
threshold
he
turned
round
and
said
we
see
what
the
courts
will
think
of
this
boy
story
my
mother
i
may
call
her
so
now
replied
quietly
may
take
the
matter
to
the
courts
i
have
not
done
so
because
you
are
my
brother
the
door
closed
then
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
kissed
my
mother
as
she
kissed
me
will
you
tell
your
mother
that
i
kept
the
secret
said
mattia
coming
up
to
us
you
knew
all
then
i
told
mattia
not
to
speak
of
all
this
to
you
said
my
mother
for
though
i
did
believe
that
you
were
my
son
i
had
to
have
certain
proofs
and
get
madame
barberin
here
with
the
clothes
how
unhappy
we
should
have
been
if
after
all
we
had
made
a
mistake
we
have
these
proofs
and
we
shall
never
be
parted
again
you
will
live
with

mattia
and
lise

that
in

of
his
tremendous
success
in

an
engagement

watched
him
develop
and
grow
when
we
were
all
three
working
together
under
the
direction

little
progress

mattia
grinned
from
a
beautiful
box
lined
with
velvet
he
drew
out
an
old
violin
which
would
not
have
brought
two
francs
if
he
had
wished
to
sell
it
i
took
from
its
coverings
a
harp
the
wood
of
which
had
been
washed
so
often
by
the
rain
that
it
was
now
restored
to
its
original
color
will
you
sing
your
neapolitan
song
asked
mattia

lise
back
her
speech
i
said
smiling
at
my
wife
who
stood
beside
me
our
guests
drew
round
us
in
a
circle
a
dog
suddenly
came
forward
good
old
capi
he
is
very
old
and
deaf
but
he
still
has
good
eyesight
from
the
cushion
which
he
occupies
he
has
recognized
the
harp
and
up
he
comes
limping
for
the
performance
in
his
jaws
he
holds
a
saucer
he
wants
to
make
the
rounds
of
the
distinguished
audience
he
tries
to
walk
on
his
two
hind
paws
but
strength
fails
him
so
he
sits
down
gravely
and
with
his
paw
on
his
heart
he
bows
to
the
society
our
song
ended
capi
gets
up
as
best
he
can
and
makes
the
round
each
one
drops
something
into
the
saucer
and
capi
delightedly
brings
it
to
me
it
is
the
best
collection
he
has
ever
made
there
are
only
gold
and
silver
coins
francs
i
kiss
him
on
his
cold
nose
as
in
other
days
and
the
thought
of
the
miseries
of
my
childhood
gives
me
an
idea
i
tell
my
guests
that
this
sum
shall
be
the
first
subscription
to
found
a
home
for
little
street
musicians
my
mother
and
i
will
donate
the
rest
dear
madam
said
mattia
bending
over
my
mother
hand
let
me
have
a
little
share
in
this
good
work

proceeds
of
my
first

collection

barked
approval
