preface
these
reminiscences
were
written
and
published
by
the
author
in
his
fiftieth
year
shortly
before
he
started
on
a
trip
to
europe
and
america
for
his
failing
health
in
it
was
in
the
course
of
this
trip
that
he
wrote
for
the
first
time
in
the
english
language
for
publication
in
these
memory
pictures
so
lightly
even
casually
presented
by
the
author
there
is
nevertheless
revealed
a
connected
history
of
his
inner
life
together
with
that
of
the
varying
literary
forms
in
which
his
growing
self
found
successive
expression
up
to
the
point
at
which
both
his
soul
and
poetry
attained
maturity
this
lightness
of
manner
and
importance
of
matter
form
a
combination
the
translation
of
which
into
a
different
language
is
naturally
a
matter
of
considerable
difficulty
it
was
in
any
case
a
task
which
the
present
translator
not
being
an
original
writer
in
the
english
language
would
hardly
have
ventured
to
undertake
had
there
not
been
other
considerations
the
translator
familiarity
however
with
the
persons
scenes
and
events
herein
depicted
made
it
a
temptation
difficult
for
him
to
resist
as
well
as
a
responsibility
which
he
did
not
care
to
leave
to
others
not
possessing
these
advantages
and
therefore
more
liable
to
miss
a
point
or
give
a
wrong
impression
the
translator
moreover
had
the
author
permission
and
advice
to
make
a
free
translation
a
portion
of
which
was
completed
and
approved
by
the
latter
before
he
left
india
on
his
recent
tour
to
japan
and
america
in
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
freedom
taken
for
the
purposes
of
the
translation
it
may
be
mentioned
that
those
suggestions
which
might
not
have
been
as
clear
to
the
foreign
as
to
the
bengali
reader
have
been
brought
out
in
a
slightly
more
elaborate
manner
than
in
the
original
text
while
again
in
rare
cases
others
which
depend
on
allusions
entirely
unfamiliar
to
the
reader
have
been
omitted
rather
than
spoil
by
an
the
simplicity
and
naturalness
which
is
the
great
feature
of
the
original
there
are
no
footnotes
in
the
original
all
the
footnotes
here
given
have
been
added
by
the
translator
in
the
hope
that
they
may
be
of
further
assistance
to
the
foreign
reader

i
know
not
who
paints
the
pictures
on

canvas
but
whoever
he
may
be
what
he
is
painting
are
pictures
by
which
i
mean
that
he
is
not
there
with
his
brush
simply
to
make
a
faithful
copy
of
all
that
is
happening
he
takes
in
and
leaves
out
according
to
his
taste
he
makes
many
a
big
thing
small
and
small
thing
big
he
has
no
compunction
in
putting
into
the
background
that
which
was
to
the
fore
or
bringing
to
the
front
that
which
was
behind
in
short
he
is
painting
pictures
and
not
writing
history
thus
over
life
outward
aspect
passes
the
series
of
events
and
within
is
being
painted
a
set
of
pictures
the
two
correspond
but
are
not
one
we
do
not
get
the
leisure
to
view
thoroughly
this
studio
within
us
portions
of
it
now
and
then
catch
our
eye
but
the
greater
part
remains
out
of
sight
in
the
darkness
why
the
painter
is
painting
when
he
will
have
done
for
what
gallery
his
pictures
are
destined
who
can
tell
some
years
ago
on
being
questioned
as
to
the
events
of
my
past
life
i
had
occasion
to
pry
into
this
i
had
thought
to
be
content
with
selecting
some
few
materials
for
my
life
story
i
then
discovered
as
i
opened
the
door
that
life
memories
are
not
history
but
the
original
work
of
an
unseen
artist
the
variegated
colours
scattered
about
are
not
reflections
of
outside
lights
but
belong
to
the
painter
himself
and
come
from
his
heart
thereby
unfitting
the
record
on
the
canvas
for
use
as
evidence
in
a
court
of
law
but
though
the
attempt
to
gather
precise
history
from
storehouse
may
be
fruitless
there
is
a
fascination
in
looking
over
the
pictures
a
fascination
which
cast
its
spell
on
me
the
road
over
which
we
journey
the
wayside
shelter
in
which
we
pause
are
not
pictures
while
yet
we
travel
they
are
too
necessary
too
obvious
when
however
before
turning
into
the
evening
resthouse
we
look
back
upon
the
cities
fields
rivers
and
hills
which
we
have
been
through
in
life
morning
then
in
the
light
of
the
passing
day
are
they
pictures
indeed
thus
when
my
opportunity
came
did
i
look
back
and
was
engrossed
was
this
interest
aroused
within
me
solely
by
a
natural
affection
for
my
own
past
some
personal
feeling
of
course
there
must
have
been
but
the
pictures
had
also
an
independent
artistic
value
of
their
own
there
is
no
event
in
my
reminiscences
worthy
of
being
preserved
for
all
time
but
the
quality
of
the
subject
is
not
the
only
justification
for
a
record
what
one
has
truly
felt
if
only
it
can
be
made
sensible
to
others
is
always
of
importance
to
one
fellow
men
if
pictures
which
have
taken
shape
in
memory
can
be
brought
out
in
words
they
are
worth
a
place
in
literature
it
is
as
literary
material
that
i
offer
my
memory
pictures
to
take
them
as
an
attempt
at
autobiography
would
be
a
mistake
in
such
a
view
these
reminiscences
would
appear
useless
as
well
as
incomplete
we
three
boys
were
being
brought
up
together
both
my
companions
were
two
years
older
than
i
when
they
were
placed
under
their
tutor
my
teaching
also
began
but
of
what
i
learnt
nothing
remains
in
my
memory
what
constantly
recurs
to
me
is
the
rain
patters
the
leaf
quivers
i
am
just
come
to
anchor
after
crossing
the
stormy
region
of
the
series
and
i
am
reading
the
rain
patters
the
leaf
quivers
for
me
the
first
poem
of
the
arch
poet
whenever
the
joy
of
that
day
comes
back
to
me
even
now
i
realise
why
rhyme
is
so
needful
in
poetry
because
of
it
the
words
come
to
an
end
and
yet
end
not
the
utterance
is
over
but
not
its
ring
and
the
ear
and
the
mind
can
go
on
and
on
with
their
game
of
tossing
the
rhyme
to
each
other
thus
did
the
rain
patter
and
the
leaves
quiver
again
and
again
the
day
in
my
consciousness
another
episode
of
this
period
of
my
early
boyhood
is
held
fast
in
my
mind
we
had
an
old
cashier
kailash
by
name
who
was
like
one
of
the
family
he
was
a
great
wit
and
would
be
constantly
cracking
jokes
with
everybody
old
and
young
recently
married
new
comers
into
the
family
circle
being
his
special
butts
there
was
room
for
the
suspicion
that
his
humour
had
not
deserted
him
even
after
death
once
my
elders
were
engaged
in
an
attempt
to
start
a
postal
service
with
the
other
world
by
means
of
a
planchette
at
one
of
the
sittings
the
pencil
scrawled
out
the
name
of
kailash
he
was
asked
as
to
the
sort
of
life
one
led
where
he
was
not
a
bit
of
it
was
the
reply
why
should
you
get
so
cheap
what
i
had
to
die
to
learn
this
kailash
used
to
rattle
off
for
my
special
delectation
a
doggerel
ballad
of
his
own
composition
the
hero
was
myself
and
there
was
a
glowing
anticipation
of
the
arrival
of
a
heroine
and
as
i
listened
my
interest
would
wax
intense
at
the
picture
of
this
bride
illuminating
the
lap
of
the
future
in
which
she
sat
enthroned
the
list
of
the
jewellery
with
which
she
was
bedecked
from
head
to
foot
and
the
unheard
of
splendour
of
the
preparations
for
the
bridal
might
have
turned
older
and
wiser
heads
but
what
moved
the
boy
and
set
wonderful
joy
pictures
flitting
before
his
vision
was
the
rapid
jingle
of
the
frequent
rhymes
and
the
swing
of
the
rhythm
these
two
literary
delights
still
linger
in
my
memory
and
there
is
the
other
the
infants
classic
the
rain
falls
the
tide
comes
up
the
river
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
the
beginning
of
my
one
day
i
saw
my
elder
brother
and
my
sister
son
satya
also
a
little
older
than
myself
starting
off
to
school
leaving
me
behind
accounted
unfit
i
had
never
before
ridden
in
a
carriage
nor
even
been
out
of
the
house
so
when
satya
came
back
full
of
unduly
glowing
accounts
of
his
adventures
on
the
way
i
felt
i
simply
could
not
stay
at
home
our
tutor
tried
to
dispel
my
illusion
with
sound
advice
and
a
resounding
slap
you
crying
to
go
to
school
now
you
have
to
cry
a
lot
more
to
be
let
off
later
on
i
have
no
recollection
of
the
name
features
or
disposition
of
this
tutor
of
ours
but
the
impression
of
his
weighty
advice
and
weightier
hand
has
not
yet
faded
never
in
my
life
have
i
heard
a
truer
prophecy
my
crying
drove
me
prematurely
into
the
oriental
seminary
what
i
learnt
there
i
have
no
idea
but
one
of
its
methods
of
punishment
i
still
bear
in
mind
the
boy
who
was
unable
to
repeat
his
lessons
was
made
to
stand
on
a
bench
with
arms
extended
and
on
his
upturned
palms
were
piled
a
number
of
slates
it
is
for
psychologists
to
debate
how
far
this
method
is
likely
to
conduce
to
a
better
grasp
of
things
i
thus
began
my
schooling
at
an
extremely
tender
age
my
initiation
into
literature
had
its
origin
at
the
same
time
in
the
books
which
were
in
vogue
in
the
servants
quarters
chief
among
these
were
a
bengali
translation
of
chanakya
aphorisms
and
the
ramayana
of
krittivasa
a
picture
of
one
day
reading
of
the
ramayana
comes
clearly
back
to
me
illustration
rabindranath
tagore
in
the
day
was
a
cloudy
one
i
was
playing
about
in
the
long
verandah
overlooking
the
road
all
of
a
sudden
satya
for
some
reason
i
do
not
remember
wanted
to
frighten
me
by
shouting
policeman
policeman
my
ideas
of
the
duties
of
policemen
were
of
an
extremely
vague
description
one
thing
i
was
certain
about
that
a
person
charged
with
crime
once
placed
in
a
policeman
hands
would
as
sure
as
the
wretch
caught
in
a
crocodile
serrated
grip
go
under
and
be
seen
no
more
not
knowing
how
an
innocent
boy
could
escape
this
relentless
penal
code
i
bolted
towards
the
inner
apartments
with
shudders
running
down
my
back
for
blind
fear
of
pursuing
policemen
i
broke
to
my
mother
the
news
of
my
impending
doom
but
it
did
not
seem
to
disturb
her
much
however
not
deeming
it
safe
to
venture
out
again
i
sat
down
on
the
sill
of
my
mother
door
to
read
the
ramayana
with
a
marbled
paper
cover
which
belonged
to
her
old
aunt
alongside
stretched
the
verandah
running
round
the
four
sides
of
the
open
inner
quadrangle
on
which
had
fallen
the
faint
afternoon
glow
of
the
clouded
sky
and
finding
me
weeping
over
one
of
its
sorrowful
situations
my
came
and
took
away
the
book
from
me
and
luxury
was
a
thing
almost
unknown
in
the
days
of
my
infancy
the
standard
of
living
was
then
as
a
whole
much
more
simple
than
it
is
now
apart
from
that
the
children
of
our
household
were
entirely
free
from
the
fuss
of
being
too
much
looked
after
the
fact
is
that
while
the
process
of
looking
after
may
be
an
occasional
treat
for
the
guardians
to
the
children
it
is
always
an
unmitigated
nuisance
we
used
to
be
under
the
rule
of
the
servants
to
save
themselves
trouble
they
had
almost
suppressed
our
right
of
free
movement
but
the
freedom
of
not
being
petted
made
up
even
for
the
harshness
of
this
bondage
for
our
minds
were
left
clear
of
the
toils
of
constant
coddling
pampering
and
our
food
had
nothing
to
do
with
delicacies
a
list
of
our
articles
of
clothing
would
only
invite
the
modern
boy
scorn
on
no
pretext
did
we
wear
socks
or
shoes
till
we
had
passed
our
tenth
year
in
the
cold
weather
a
second
cotton
tunic
over
the
first
one
sufficed
it
never
entered
our
heads
to
consider
ourselves
for
that
reason
it
was
only
when
old
niyamat
the
tailor
would
forget
to
put
a
pocket
into
one
of
our
tunics
that
we
complained
for
no
boy
has
yet
been
born
so
poor
as
not
to
have
the
wherewithal
to
stuff
his
pockets
nor
by
a
merciful
dispensation
of
providence
is
there
much
difference
between
the
wealth
of
boys
of
rich
and
of
poor
parentage
we
used
to
have
a
pair
of
slippers
each
but
not
always
where
we
had
our
feet
our
habit
of
kicking
the
slippers
on
ahead
and
catching
them
up
again
made
them
work
none
the
less
hard
through
effectually
defeating
at
every
step
the
reason
of
their
being
our
elders
were
in
every
way
at
a
great
distance
from
us
in
their
dress
and
food
living
and
doing
conversation
and
amusement
we
caught
glimpses
of
these
but
they
were
beyond
our
reach
elders
have
become
cheap
to
modern
children
they
are
too
readily
accessible
and
so
are
all
objects
of
desire
nothing
ever
came
so
easily
to
us
many
a
trivial
thing
was
for
us
a
rarity
and
we
lived
mostly
in
the
hope
of
attaining
when
we
were
old
enough
the
things
which
the
distant
future
held
in
trust
for
us
the
result
was
that
what
little
we
did
get
we
enjoyed
to
the
utmost
from
skin
to
core
nothing
was
thrown
away
the
modern
child
of
a
family
nibbles
at
only
half
the
things
he
gets
the
greater
part
of
his
world
is
wasted
on
him
our
days
were
spent
in
the
servants
quarters
in
the
corner
of
the
outer
apartments
one
of
our
servants
was
shyam
a
dark
chubby
boy
with
curly
locks
hailing
from
the
district
of
khulna
he
would
put
me
into
a
selected
spot
and
tracing
a
chalk
line
all
round
warn
me
with
solemn
face
and
uplifted
finger
of
the
perils
of
transgressing
this
ring
whether
the
threatened
danger
was
material
or
spiritual
i
never
fully
understood
but
a
great
fear
used
to
possess
me
i
had
read
in
the
ramayana
of
the
tribulations
of
sita
for
having
left
the
ring
drawn
by
lakshman
so
it
was
not
possible
for
me
to
be
sceptical
of
its
potency
just
below
the
window
of
this
room
was
a
tank
with
a
flight
of
masonry
steps
leading
down
into
the
water
on
its
west
bank
along
the
garden
wall
an
immense
banyan
tree
to
the
south
a
fringe
of
cocoanut
palms
ringed
round
as
i
was
near
this
window
i
would
spend
the
whole
day
peering
through
the
drawn
venetian
shutters
gazing
and
gazing
on
this
scene
as
on
a
picture
book
from
early
morning
our
neighbours
would
drop
in
one
by
one
to
have
their
bath
i
knew
the
time
for
each
one
to
arrive
i
was
familiar
with
the
peculiarities
of
each
one
toilet
one
would
stop
up
his
ears
with
his
fingers
as
he
took
his
regulation
number
of
dips
after
which
he
would
depart
another
would
not
venture
on
a
complete
immersion
but
be
content
with
only
squeezing
his
wet
towel
repeatedly
over
his
head
a
third
would
carefully
drive
the
surface
impurities
away
from
him
with
a
rapid
play
of
his
arms
and
then
on
a
sudden
impulse
take
his
plunge
there
was
one
who
jumped
in
from
the
top
steps
without
any
preliminaries
at
all
another
would
walk
slowly
in
step
by
step
muttering
his
morning
prayers
the
while
one
was
always
in
a
hurry
hastening
home
as
soon
as
he
was
through
with
his
dip
another
was
in
no
sort
of
hurry
at
all
taking
his
bath
leisurely
followed
with
a
good
and
a
change
from
wet
bathing
clothes
into
clean
ones
including
a
careful
adjustment
of
the
folds
of
his
waist
cloth
ending
with
a
turn
or
two
in
the
outer
garden
and
the
gathering
of
flowers
with
which
he
would
finally
saunter
slowly
homewards
radiating
the
cool
comfort
of
his
refreshed
body
as
he
went
this
would
go
on
till
it
was
past
noon
then
the
bathing
places
would
be
deserted
and
become
silent
only
the
ducks
remained
paddling
about
after
water
snails
or
busy
preening
their
feathers
the
day
when
solitude
thus
reigned
over
the
water
my
whole
attention
would
be
drawn
to
the
shadows
under
the
banyan
tree
some
of
its
aerial
roots
creeping
down
along
its
trunk
had
formed
a
dark
complication
of
coils
at
its
base
it
seemed
as
if
into
this
mysterious
region
the
laws
of
the
universe
had
not
found
entrance
as
if
some
had
escaped
the
divine
vigilance
and
lingered
on
into
the
light
of
modern
day
whom
i
used
to
see
there
and
what
those
beings
did
it
is
not
possible
to
express
in
intelligible
language
it
was
about
this
banyan
tree
that
i
wrote
later
with
tangled
roots
hanging
down
from
your
branches
o
ancient
banyan
tree
you
stand
still
day
and
night
like
an
ascetic
at
his
penances
do
you
ever
remember
the
child
whose
fancy
played
with
your
shadows
alas
that
banyan
tree
is
no
more
nor
the
piece
of
water
which
served
to
mirror
the
majestic
many
of
those
who
used
to
bathe
there
have
also
followed
into
oblivion
the
shade
of
the
banyan
tree
and
that
boy
grown
older
is
counting
the
alternations
of
light
and
darkness
which
penetrate
the
complexities
with
which
the
roots
he
has
thrown
off
on
all
sides
have
encircled
him
going
out
of
the
house
was
forbidden
to
us
in
fact
we
had
not
even
the
freedom
of
all
its
parts
we
perforce
took
our
peeps
at
nature
from
behind
the
barriers
beyond
my
reach
there
was
this
limitless
thing
called
the
outside
of
which
flashes
and
sounds
and
scents
used
momentarily
to
come
and
touch
me
through
its
interstices
it
seemed
to
want
to
play
with
me
through
the
bars
with
so
many
gestures
but
it
was
free
and
i
was
bound
there
was
no
way
of
meeting
so
the
attraction
was
all
the
stronger
the
chalk
line
has
been
wiped
away
but
the
confining
ring
is
still
there
the
distant
is
just
as
distant
the
outside
is
still
beyond
me
and
i
am
reminded
of
the
poem
i
wrote
when
i
was
older
the
tame
bird
was
in
a
cage
the
free
bird
was
in
the
forest
they
met
when
the
time
came
it
was
a
decree
of
fate
the
free
bird
cries
o
my
love
let
us
fly
to
wood
the
cage
bird
whispers
come
hither
let
us
both
live
in
the
cage
says
the
free
bird
among
bars
where
is
there
room
to
spread
one
wings
alas
cries
the
cage
bird
i
should
not
know
where
to
sit
perched
in
the
sky
the
parapets
of
our
terraced
roofs
were
higher
than
my
head
when
i
had
grown
taller
when
the
tyranny
of
the
servants
had
relaxed
when
with
the
coming
of
a
newly
married
bride
into
the
house
i
had
achieved
some
recognition
as
a
companion
of
her
leisure
then
did
i
sometimes
come
up
to
the
terrace
in
the
middle
of
the
day
by
that
time
everybody
in
the
house
would
have
finished
their
meal
there
would
be
an
interval
in
the
business
of
the
household
over
the
inner
apartments
would
rest
the
quiet
of
the
midday
siesta
the
wet
bathing
clothes
would
be
hanging
over
the
parapets
to
dry
the
crows
would
be
picking
at
the
leavings
thrown
on
the
refuse
heap
at
the
corner
of
the
yard
in
the
solitude
of
that
interval
the
caged
bird
would
through
the
gaps
in
the
parapet
commune
bill
to
bill
with
the
free
bird
illustration
the
inner
garden
was
my
paradise
i
would
stand
and
gaze
my
glance
first
falls
on
the
row
of
cocoanut
trees
on
the
further
edge
of
our
inner
garden
through
these
are
seen
the
singhi
garden
with
its
cluster
of
huts
and
tank
and
on
the
edge
of
the
tank
the
dairy
of
our
milkwoman
tara
still
further
on
mixed
up
with
the
the
various
shapes
and
different
heights
of
the
terraced
roofs
of
calcutta
flashing
back
the
blazing
whiteness
of
the
midday
sun
stretch
right
away
into
the
grayish
blue
of
the
eastern
horizon
and
some
of
these
far
distant
dwellings
from
which
stand
forth
their
roofed
leading
up
to
the
terrace
look
as
if
with
uplifted
finger
and
a
wink
they
are
hinting
to
me
of
the
mysteries
of
their
interiors
like
the
beggar
at
the
palace
door
who
imagines
impossible
treasures
to
be
held
in
the
strong
rooms
closed
to
him
i
can
hardly
tell
of
the
wealth
of
play
and
freedom
which
these
unknown
dwellings
seem
to
me
crowded
with
from
the
furthest
depth
of
the
sky
full
of
burning
sunshine
overhead
the
thin
shrill
cry
of
a
kite
reaches
my
ear
and
from
the
lane
adjoining
singhi
garden
comes
up
past
the
houses
silent
in
their
noonday
slumber
the
of
the
choori
and
my
whole
being
would
fly
away
from
the
world
my
father
hardly
ever
stayed
at
home
he
was
constantly
roaming
about
his
rooms
on
the
third
storey
used
to
remain
shut
up
i
would
pass
my
hands
through
the
venetian
shutters
and
thus
opening
the
latch
get
the
door
open
and
spend
the
afternoon
lying
motionless
on
his
sofa
at
the
south
end
first
of
all
it
was
a
room
always
closed
and
then
there
was
the
stolen
entry
this
gave
it
a
deep
flavour
of
mystery
further
the
broad
empty
expanse
of
terrace
to
the
south
glowing
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
would
set
me
there
was
yet
another
attraction
the
had
just
been
started
in
calcutta
and
in
the
first
exuberance
of
its
triumphant
entry
it
did
not
stint
even
the
indian
quarters
of
their
supply
in
that
golden
age
of
pipe
water
it
used
to
flow
even
up
to
my
father
third
storey
rooms
and
turning
on
the
shower
tap
i
would
indulge
to
my
content
in
an
untimely
bath
not
so
much
for
the
comfort
of
it
as
to
give
rein
to
my
desire
to
do
just
as
i
fancied
the
alternation
of
the
joy
of
liberty
and
the
fear
of
being
caught
made
that
shower
of
municipal
water
send
arrows
of
delight
thrilling
into
me
it
was
perhaps
because
the
possibility
of
contact
with
the
outside
was
so
remote
that
the
joy
of
it
came
to
me
so
much
more
readily
when
material
is
in
profusion
the
mind
gets
lazy
and
leaves
everything
to
it
forgetting
that
for
a
successful
feast
of
joy
its
internal
equipment
counts
for
more
than
the
external
this
is
the
chief
lesson
which
his
infant
state
has
to
teach
to
man
there
his
possessions
are
few
and
trivial
yet
he
needs
no
more
for
his
happiness
the
world
of
play
is
spoilt
for
the
unfortunate
youngster
who
is
burdened
with
an
unlimited
quantity
of
playthings
to
call
our
inner
garden
a
garden
is
to
say
a
deal
too
much
its
properties
consisted
of
a
citron
tree
a
couple
of
plum
trees
of
different
varieties
and
a
row
of
cocoanut
trees
in
the
centre
was
a
paved
circle
the
cracks
of
which
various
grasses
and
weeds
had
invaded
and
planted
in
them
their
victorious
standards
only
those
flowering
plants
which
refused
to
die
of
neglect
continued
uncomplainingly
to
perform
their
respective
duties
without
casting
any
aspersions
on
the
gardener
in
the
northern
corner
was
a
shed
where
the
inmates
of
the
inner
apartments
would
occasionally
foregather
when
household
necessity
demanded
this
last
vestige
of
rural
life
has
since
owned
defeat
and
slunk
away
ashamed
and
unnoticed
none
the
less
i
suspect
that
adam
garden
of
eden
could
hardly
have
been
better
adorned
than
this
one
of
ours
for
he
and
his
paradise
were
alike
naked
they
needed
not
to
be
furnished
with
material
things
it
is
only
since
his
tasting
of
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
till
he
can
fully
digest
it
that
man
need
for
external
furniture
and
embellishment
persistently
grows
our
inner
garden
was
my
paradise
it
was
enough
for
me
i
well
remember
how
in
the
early
autumn
dawn
i
would
run
there
as
soon
as
i
was
awake
a
scent
of
dewy
grass
and
foliage
would
rush
to
meet
me
and
the
morning
with
its
cool
fresh
sunlight
would
peep
out
at
me
over
the
top
of
the
eastern
garden
wall
from
below
the
trembling
tassels
of
the
cocoanut
palms
there
is
another
piece
of
vacant
land
to
the
north
of
the
house
which
to
this
day
we
call
the
barn
house
the
name
shows
that
in
some
remote
past
this
must
have
been
the
place
where
the
year
store
of
grain
used
to
be
kept
in
a
barn
then
as
with
brother
and
sister
in
infancy
the
likeness
between
town
and
country
was
visible
all
over
now
the
family
resemblance
can
hardly
be
traced
this
would
be
my
holiday
haunt
if
i
got
the
chance
it
would
hardly
be
correct
to
say
that
i
went
there
to
play
it
was
the
place
not
play
which
drew
me
why
this
was
so
is
difficult
to
tell
perhaps
its
being
a
deserted
bit
of
waste
land
lying
in
an
corner
gave
it
its
charm
for
me
it
was
entirely
outside
the
living
quarters
and
bore
no
stamp
of
usefulness
moreover
it
was
as
unadorned
as
it
was
useless
for
no
one
had
ever
planted
anything
there
it
was
doubtless
for
these
reasons
that
this
desert
spot
offered
no
resistance
to
the
free
play
of
the
imagination
whenever
i
got
any
to
evade
the
vigilance
of
my
warders
and
could
contrive
to
reach
the
i
felt
i
had
a
holiday
indeed
there
was
yet
another
place
in
our
house
which
i
have
even
yet
not
succeeded
in
finding
out
a
little
girl
playmate
of
my
own
age
called
this
the
king
palace
i
have
just
been
there
she
would
sometimes
tell
me
but
somehow
the
propitious
moment
never
turned
up
when
she
could
take
me
along
with
her
that
was
a
wonderful
place
and
its
playthings
were
as
wonderful
as
the
games
that
were
played
there
it
seemed
to
me
it
must
be
somewhere
very
near
perhaps
in
the
first
or
second
storey
the
only
thing
was
one
never
seemed
to
be
able
to
get
there
how
often
have
i
asked
my
companion
only
tell
me
is
it
really
inside
the
house
or
outside
and
she
would
always
reply
no
no
in
this
very
house
i
would
sit
and
wonder
where
then
can
it
be
do
i
know
all
the
rooms
of
the
house
who
the
king
might
be
i
never
cared
to
inquire
where
his
palace
is
still
remains
undiscovered
this
much
was
clear
the
king
palace
was
within
our
house
looking
back
on
childhood
days
the
thing
that
recurs
most
often
is
the
mystery
which
used
to
fill
both
life
and
world
something
undreamt
of
was
lurking
everywhere
and
the
uppermost
question
every
day
was
when
oh
when
would
we
come
across
it
it
was
as
if
nature
held
something
in
her
closed
hands
and
was
smilingly
asking
us
what
think
i
have
what
was
impossible
for
her
to
have
was
the
thing
we
had
no
idea
of
well
do
i
remember
the
custard
apple
seed
which
i
had
planted
and
kept
in
a
corner
of
the
south
verandah
and
used
to
water
every
day
the
thought
that
the
seed
might
possibly
grow
into
a
tree
kept
me
in
a
great
state
of
fluttering
wonder
custard
apple
seeds
still
have
the
habit
of
sprouting
but
no
longer
to
the
accompaniment
of
that
feeling
of
wonder
the
fault
is
not
in
the
custard
apple
but
in
the
mind
we
had
once
stolen
some
rocks
from
an
elder
cousin
rockery
and
started
a
little
rockery
of
our
own
the
plants
which
we
sowed
in
its
interstices
were
cared
for
so
excessively
that
it
was
only
because
of
their
vegetable
nature
that
they
managed
to
put
up
with
it
till
their
untimely
death
words
can
not
recount
the
endless
joy
and
wonder
which
this
miniature
held
for
us
we
had
no
doubt
that
this
creation
of
ours
would
be
a
wonderful
thing
to
our
elders
also
the
day
that
we
sought
to
put
this
to
the
proof
however
the
hillock
in
the
corner
of
our
room
with
all
its
rocks
and
all
its
vegetation
vanished
the
knowledge
that
the
schoolroom
floor
was
not
a
proper
foundation
for
the
erection
of
a
mountain
was
imparted
so
rudely
and
with
such
suddenness
that
it
gave
us
a
considerable
shock
the
weight
of
stone
of
which
the
floor
was
relieved
settled
on
our
minds
when
we
realised
the
gulf
between
our
fancies
and
the
will
of
our
elders
how
intimately
did
the
life
of
the
world
throb
for
us
in
those
days
earth
water
foliage
and
sky
they
all
spoke
to
us
and
would
not
be
disregarded
how
often
were
we
struck
by
the
poignant
regret
that
we
could
only
see
the
upper
storey
of
the
earth
and
knew
nothing
of
its
inner
storey
all
our
planning
was
as
to
how
we
could
pry
beneath
its
cover
if
thought
we
we
could
drive
in
bamboo
after
bamboo
one
over
the
other
we
might
perhaps
get
into
some
sort
of
touch
with
its
inmost
depths
during
the
festival
a
series
of
wooden
pillars
used
to
be
planted
round
the
outer
courtyard
for
supporting
the
chandeliers
digging
holes
for
these
would
begin
on
the
first
of
the
preparations
for
festivity
are
ever
interesting
to
young
folk
but
this
digging
had
a
special
attraction
for
me
though
i
had
watched
it
done
year
after
year
and
seen
the
hole
grow
bigger
and
bigger
till
the
digger
had
completely
disappeared
inside
and
yet
nothing
extraordinary
nothing
worthy
of
the
quest
of
prince
or
knight
had
ever
appeared
yet
every
time
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
lid
being
lifted
off
a
chest
of
mystery
i
felt
that
a
little
bit
more
digging
would
do
it
year
after
year
passed
but
that
bit
never
got
done
there
was
a
pull
at
the
curtain
but
it
was
not
drawn
the
elders
thought
i
can
do
whatever
they
please
why
do
they
rest
content
with
such
shallow
delving
if
we
young
folk
had
the
ordering
of
it
the
inmost
mystery
of
the
earth
would
no
longer
be
allowed
to
remain
smothered
in
its
dust
covering
and
the
thought
that
behind
every
part
of
the
vault
of
blue
reposed
the
mysteries
of
the
sky
would
also
spur
our
imaginings
when
our
pundit
in
illustration
of
some
lesson
in
our
bengali
science
primer
told
us
that
the
blue
sphere
was
not
an
enclosure
how
thunderstruck
we
were
put
ladder
upon
ladder
said
he
and
go
on
mounting
away
but
you
will
never
bump
your
head
he
must
be
sparing
of
his
ladders
i
opined
and
questioned
with
a
rising
inflection
and
what
if
we
put
more
ladders
and
more
and
more
when
i
realised
that
it
was
fruitless
multiplying
ladders
i
remained
dumbfounded
pondering
over
the
matter
surely
i
concluded
such
an
astounding
piece
of
news
must
be
known
only
to
those
who
are
the
world
schoolmasters
part
ii
in
the
history
of
india
the
regime
of
the
slave
dynasty
was
not
a
happy
one
in
going
back
to
the
reign
of
the
servants
in
my
own
life
history
i
can
find
nothing
glorious
or
cheerful
touching
the
period
there
were
frequent
changes
of
king
but
never
a
variation
in
the
code
of
restraints
and
punishments
with
which
we
were
afflicted
we
however
had
no
opportunity
at
the
time
for
philosophising
on
the
subject
our
backs
bore
as
best
they
could
the
blows
which
befell
them
and
we
accepted
as
one
of
the
laws
of
the
universe
that
it
is
for
the
big
to
hurt
and
for
the
small
to
be
hurt
it
has
taken
me
a
long
time
to
learn
the
opposite
truth
that
it
is
the
big
who
suffer
and
the
small
who
cause
suffering
the
quarry
does
not
view
virtue
and
vice
from
the
standpoint
of
the
hunter
that
is
why
the
alert
bird
whose
cry
warns
its
fellows
before
the
shot
has
sped
gets
abused
as
vicious
we
howled
when
we
were
beaten
which
our
chastisers
did
not
consider
good
manners
it
was
in
fact
counted
sedition
against
the
servocracy
i
can
not
forget
how
in
order
effectively
to
suppress
such
sedition
our
heads
used
to
be
crammed
into
the
huge
water
jars
then
in
use
distasteful
doubtless
was
this
outcry
to
those
who
caused
it
moreover
it
was
likely
to
have
unpleasant
consequences
i
now
sometimes
wonder
why
such
cruel
treatment
was
meted
out
to
us
by
the
servants
i
can
not
admit
that
there
was
on
the
whole
anything
in
our
behaviour
or
demeanour
to
have
put
us
beyond
the
pale
of
human
kindness
the
real
reason
must
have
been
that
the
whole
of
our
burden
was
thrown
on
the
servants
and
the
whole
burden
is
a
thing
difficult
to
bear
even
for
those
who
are
nearest
and
dearest
if
children
are
only
allowed
to
be
children
to
run
and
play
about
and
satisfy
their
curiosity
it
becomes
quite
simple
insoluble
problems
are
only
created
if
you
try
to
confine
them
inside
keep
them
still
or
hamper
their
play
then
does
the
burden
of
the
child
so
lightly
borne
by
its
own
childishness
fall
heavily
on
the
guardian
like
that
of
the
horse
in
the
fable
which
was
carried
instead
of
being
allowed
to
trot
on
its
own
legs
and
though
money
procured
bearers
even
for
such
a
burden
it
could
not
prevent
them
taking
it
out
of
the
unlucky
beast
at
every
step
of
most
of
these
tyrants
of
our
childhood
i
remember
only
their
cuffings
and
boxings
and
nothing
more
only
one
personality
stands
out
in
my
memory
his
name
was
iswar
he
had
been
a
village
schoolmaster
before
he
was
a
prim
proper
and
sedately
dignified
personage
the
earth
seemed
too
earthy
for
him
with
too
little
water
to
keep
it
sufficiently
clean
so
that
he
had
to
be
in
a
constant
state
of
warfare
with
its
chronic
soiled
state
he
would
shoot
his
into
the
tank
with
a
lightning
movement
so
as
to
get
his
supply
from
an
uncontaminated
depth
it
was
he
who
when
bathing
in
the
tank
would
be
continually
thrusting
away
the
surface
impurities
till
he
took
a
sudden
plunge
expecting
as
it
were
to
catch
the
water
unawares
when
walking
his
right
arm
stood
out
at
an
angle
from
his
body
as
if
so
it
seemed
to
us
he
could
not
trust
the
cleanliness
even
of
his
own
garments
his
whole
bearing
had
the
appearance
of
an
effort
to
keep
clear
of
the
imperfections
which
through
unguarded
avenues
find
entrance
into
earth
water
and
air
and
into
the
ways
of
men
unfathomable
was
the
depth
of
his
gravity
with
head
slightly
tilted
he
would
mince
his
carefully
selected
words
in
a
deep
voice
his
literary
diction
would
give
food
for
merriment
to
our
elders
behind
his
back
some
of
his
phrases
finding
a
permanent
place
in
our
family
repertoire
of
witticisms
but
i
doubt
whether
the
expressions
he
used
would
sound
as
remarkable
showing
how
the
literary
and
spoken
languages
which
used
to
be
as
sky
from
earth
asunder
are
now
coming
nearer
each
other
this
erstwhile
schoolmaster
had
discovered
a
way
of
keeping
us
quiet
in
the
evenings
every
evening
he
would
gather
us
round
the
cracked
lamp
and
read
out
to
us
stories
from
the
ramayana
and
mahabharata
some
of
the
other
servants
would
also
come
and
join
the
audience
the
lamp
would
be
throwing
huge
shadows
right
up
to
the
beams
of
the
roof
the
little
house
lizards
catching
insects
on
the
walls
the
bats
doing
a
mad
dervish
dance
round
and
round
the
verandahs
outside
and
we
listening
in
silent
wonder
i
still
remember
on
the
evening
we
came
to
the
story
of
kusha
and
lava
and
those
two
valiant
lads
were
threatening
to
humble
to
the
dust
the
renown
of
their
father
and
uncles
how
the
tense
silence
of
that
dimly
lighted
room
was
bursting
with
eager
anticipation
it
was
getting
late
our
prescribed
period
of
wakefulness
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
yet
the
denouement
was
far
off
at
this
critical
juncture
my
father
old
follower
kishori
came
to
the
rescue
and
finished
the
episode
for
us
at
express
speed
to
the
quickstep
of
dasuraya
jingling
verses
the
impression
of
the
soft
slow
chant
of
krittivasa
measure
was
swept
clean
away
and
we
were
left
overwhelmed
by
a
flood
of
rhymes
and
alliterations
on
some
occasions
these
readings
would
give
rise
to
shastric
discussions
which
would
at
length
be
settled
by
the
depth
of
wise
pronouncements
though
as
one
of
the
children
servants
his
rank
in
our
domestic
society
was
below
that
of
many
yet
as
with
old
grandfather
bhisma
in
the
mahabharata
his
supremacy
would
assert
itself
from
his
seat
below
his
juniors
our
grave
and
reverend
servitor
had
one
weakness
to
which
for
the
sake
of
historical
accuracy
i
feel
bound
to
allude
he
used
to
take
opium
this
created
a
craving
for
rich
food
so
that
when
he
brought
us
our
morning
goblets
of
milk
the
forces
of
attraction
in
his
mind
would
be
greater
than
those
of
repulsion
if
we
gave
the
least
expression
to
our
natural
repugnance
for
this
meal
no
sense
of
responsibility
for
our
health
could
prompt
him
to
press
it
on
us
a
second
time
iswar
also
held
somewhat
narrow
views
as
to
our
capacity
for
solid
nourishment
we
would
sit
down
to
our
evening
repast
and
a
quantity
of
heaped
on
a
thick
round
wooden
tray
would
be
placed
before
us
he
would
begin
by
gingerly
dropping
a
few
on
each
platter
from
a
sufficient
height
to
safeguard
himself
from
contamination
like
unwilling
favours
wrested
from
the
gods
by
dint
of
importunity
did
they
descend
so
dexterously
inhospitable
was
he
next
would
come
the
inquiry
whether
he
should
give
us
any
more
i
knew
the
reply
which
would
be
most
gratifying
and
could
not
bring
myself
to
deprive
him
by
asking
for
another
help
then
again
iswar
was
entrusted
with
a
daily
allowance
of
money
for
procuring
our
afternoon
light
refreshment
he
would
ask
us
every
morning
what
we
should
like
to
have
we
knew
that
to
mention
the
cheapest
would
be
accounted
best
so
sometimes
we
ordered
a
light
refection
of
puffed
rice
and
at
others
an
indigestible
one
of
boiled
gram
or
roasted
groundnuts
it
was
evident
that
iswar
was
not
as
painstakingly
punctilious
in
regard
to
our
diet
as
with
the
shastric
proprieties
normal
while
at
the
oriental
seminary
i
had
discovered
a
way
out
of
the
degradation
of
being
a
mere
pupil
i
had
started
a
class
of
my
own
in
a
corner
of
our
verandah
the
wooden
bars
of
the
railing
were
my
pupils
and
i
would
act
the
schoolmaster
cane
in
hand
seated
on
a
chair
in
front
of
them
i
had
decided
which
were
the
good
boys
and
which
the
bad
nay
further
i
could
distinguish
clearly
the
quiet
from
the
naughty
the
clever
from
the
stupid
the
bad
rails
had
suffered
so
much
from
my
constant
caning
that
they
must
have
longed
to
give
up
the
ghost
had
they
been
alive
and
the
more
scarred
they
got
with
my
strokes
the
worse
they
angered
me
till
i
knew
not
how
to
punish
them
enough
none
remain
to
bear
witness
how
tremendously
i
tyrannised
over
that
poor
dumb
class
of
mine
my
wooden
pupils
have
since
been
replaced
by
railings
nor
have
any
of
the
new
generation
taken
up
their
education
in
the
same
way
they
could
never
have
made
the
same
impression
i
have
since
realised
how
much
easier
it
is
to
acquire
the
manner
than
the
matter
without
an
effort
had
i
assimilated
all
the
impatience
the
short
temper
the
partiality
and
the
injustice
displayed
by
my
teachers
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
of
their
teaching
my
only
consolation
is
that
i
had
not
the
power
of
venting
these
barbarities
on
any
sentient
creature
nevertheless
the
difference
between
my
wooden
pupils
and
those
of
the
seminary
did
not
prevent
my
psychology
from
being
identical
with
that
of
its
schoolmasters
i
could
not
have
been
long
at
the
oriental
seminary
for
i
was
still
of
tender
age
when
i
joined
the
normal
school
the
only
one
of
its
features
which
i
remember
is
that
before
the
classes
began
all
the
boys
had
to
sit
in
a
row
in
the
gallery
and
go
through
some
kind
of
singing
or
chanting
of
verses
evidently
an
attempt
at
introducing
an
element
of
cheerfulness
into
the
daily
routine
unfortunately
the
words
were
english
and
the
tune
quite
as
foreign
so
that
we
had
not
the
faintest
notion
what
sort
of
incantation
we
were
practising
neither
did
the
meaningless
monotony
of
the
performance
tend
to
make
us
cheerful
this
failed
to
disturb
the
serene
of
the
school
authorities
at
having
provided
such
a
treat
they
deemed
it
superfluous
to
inquire
into
the
practical
effect
of
their
bounty
they
would
probably
have
counted
it
a
crime
for
the
boys
not
to
be
dutifully
happy
anyhow
they
rested
content
with
taking
the
song
as
they
found
it
words
and
all
from
the
english
book
which
had
furnished
the
theory
the
language
into
which
this
english
resolved
itself
in
our
mouths
can
not
but
be
edifying
to
philologists
i
can
recall
only
one
line
pullokee
singill
mellaling
mellaling
after
much
thought
i
have
been
able
to
guess
at
the
original
of
a
part
of
it
of
what
words
is
the
transformation
still
baffles
me
the
rest
i
think
was
full
of
glee
singing
merrily
merrily
merrily
as
my
memories
of
the
normal
school
emerge
from
haziness
and
become
clearer
they
are
not
the
least
sweet
in
any
particular
had
i
been
able
to
associate
with
the
other
boys
the
woes
of
learning
might
not
have
seemed
so
intolerable
but
that
turned
out
to
be
impossible
so
nasty
were
most
of
the
boys
in
their
manners
and
habits
so
in
the
intervals
of
the
classes
i
would
go
up
to
the
second
storey
and
while
away
the
time
sitting
near
a
window
overlooking
the
street
i
would
count
one
year
two
years
three
years
wondering
how
many
such
would
have
to
be
got
through
like
this
of
the
teachers
i
remember
only
one
whose
language
was
so
foul
that
out
of
sheer
contempt
for
him
i
steadily
refused
to
answer
any
one
of
his
questions
thus
i
sat
silent
throughout
the
year
at
the
bottom
of
his
class
and
while
the
rest
of
the
class
was
busy
i
would
be
left
alone
to
attempt
the
solution
of
many
an
intricate
problem
one
of
these
i
remember
on
which
i
used
to
cogitate
profoundly
was
how
to
defeat
an
enemy
without
having
arms
my
preoccupation
with
this
question
amidst
the
hum
of
the
boys
reciting
their
lessons
comes
back
to
me
even
now
if
i
could
properly
train
up
a
number
of
dogs
tigers
and
other
ferocious
beasts
and
put
a
few
lines
of
these
on
the
field
of
battle
that
i
thought
would
serve
very
well
as
an
inspiriting
prelude
with
our
personal
prowess
let
loose
thereafter
victory
should
by
no
means
be
out
of
reach
and
as
the
picture
of
this
wonderfully
simple
strategy
waxed
vivid
in
my
imagination
the
victory
of
my
side
became
assured
beyond
doubt
while
work
had
not
yet
come
into
my
life
i
always
found
it
easy
to
devise
short
cuts
to
achievement
since
i
have
been
working
i
find
that
what
is
hard
is
hard
indeed
and
what
is
difficult
remains
difficult
this
of
course
is
less
comforting
but
nowhere
near
so
bad
as
the
discomfort
of
trying
to
take
shortcuts
when
at
length
a
year
of
that
class
had
passed
we
were
examined
in
bengali
by
pandit
madhusudan
vachaspati
i
got
the
largest
number
of
marks
of
all
the
boys
the
teacher
complained
to
the
school
authorities
that
there
had
been
favouritism
in
my
case
so
i
was
examined
a
second
time
with
the
superintendent
of
the
school
seated
beside
the
examiner
this
time
also
i
got
a
top
place
i
could
not
have
been
more
than
eight
years
old
at
the
time
jyoti
a
son
of
a
niece
of
my
father
was
considerably
older
than
i
he
had
just
gained
an
entrance
into
english
literature
and
would
recite
hamlet
soliloquy
with
great
gusto
why
he
should
have
taken
it
into
his
head
to
get
a
child
as
i
was
to
write
poetry
i
can
not
tell
one
afternoon
he
sent
for
me
to
his
room
and
asked
me
to
try
and
make
up
a
verse
after
which
he
explained
to
me
the
construction
of
the
metre
of
fourteen
syllables
i
had
up
to
then
only
seen
poems
in
printed
books
no
mistakes
penned
through
no
sign
to
the
eye
of
doubt
or
trouble
or
any
human
weakness
i
could
not
have
dared
even
to
imagine
that
any
effort
of
mine
could
produce
such
poetry
one
day
a
thief
had
been
caught
in
our
house
overpowered
by
curiosity
yet
in
fear
and
trembling
i
ventured
to
the
spot
to
take
a
peep
at
him
i
found
he
was
just
an
ordinary
man
and
when
he
was
somewhat
roughly
handled
by
our
i
felt
a
great
pity
i
had
a
similar
experience
with
poetry
when
after
stringing
together
a
few
words
at
my
own
sweet
will
i
found
them
turned
into
a
verse
i
felt
i
had
no
illusions
left
about
the
glories
of
poetising
so
when
poor
poetry
is
mishandled
even
now
i
feel
as
unhappy
as
i
did
about
the
thief
many
a
time
have
i
been
moved
to
pity
and
yet
been
unable
to
restrain
impatient
hands
itching
for
the
assault
thieves
have
scarcely
suffered
so
much
and
from
so
many
the
first
feeling
of
awe
once
overcome
there
was
no
holding
me
back
i
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
manuscript
book
by
the
favour
of
one
of
the
officers
of
our
estate
with
my
own
hands
i
ruled
it
with
pencil
lines
at
not
very
regular
intervals
and
thereon
i
began
to
write
verses
in
a
large
childish
scrawl
like
a
young
deer
which
butts
here
there
and
everywhere
with
its
newly
sprouting
horns
i
made
myself
a
nuisance
with
my
budding
poetry
more
so
my
elder
brother
whose
pride
in
my
performance
impelled
him
to
hunt
about
the
house
for
an
audience
i
recollect
how
as
the
pair
of
us
one
day
were
coming
out
of
the
estate
offices
on
the
ground
floor
after
a
conquering
expedition
against
the
officers
we
came
across
the
editor
of
the
national
paper
nabagopal
mitter
who
had
just
stepped
into
the
house
my
brother
tackled
him
without
further
ado
look
here
nabagopal
babu
wo
you
listen
to
a
poem
which
rabi
has
written
the
reading
forthwith
followed
my
works
had
not
as
yet
become
voluminous
the
poet
could
carry
all
his
effusions
about
in
his
pockets
i
was
writer
printer
and
publisher
all
in
one
my
brother
as
advertiser
being
my
only
colleague
i
had
composed
some
verses
on
the
lotus
which
i
recited
to
nabagopal
babu
then
and
there
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
in
a
voice
pitched
as
high
as
my
enthusiasm
well
done
said
he
with
a
smile
but
what
is
a
how
i
had
got
hold
of
this
word
i
do
not
remember
the
ordinary
name
would
have
fitted
the
metre
quite
as
well
but
this
was
the
one
word
in
the
whole
poem
on
which
i
had
pinned
my
hopes
it
had
doubtless
duly
impressed
our
officers
but
curiously
enough
nabagopal
babu
did
not
succumb
to
it
on
the
contrary
he
smiled
he
could
not
be
an
understanding
man
i
felt
sure
i
never
read
poetry
to
him
again
i
have
since
added
many
years
to
my
age
but
have
not
been
able
to
improve
upon
my
test
of
what
does
or
does
not
constitute
understanding
in
my
hearer
however
nabagopal
babu
might
smile
the
word
like
a
bee
drunk
with
honey
stuck
to
its
place
unmoved
one
of
the
teachers
of
the
normal
school
also
gave
us
private
lessons
at
home
his
body
was
lean
his
features
dry
his
voice
sharp
he
looked
like
a
cane
incarnate
his
hours
were
from
six
to
in
the
morning
with
him
our
reading
ranged
from
popular
literary
and
science
readers
in
bengali
to
the
epic
of
meghnadvadha
my
third
brother
was
very
keen
on
imparting
to
us
a
variety
of
knowledge
so
at
home
we
had
to
go
through
much
more
than
what
was
required
by
the
school
course
we
had
to
get
up
before
dawn
and
clad
in
begin
with
a
bout
or
two
with
a
blind
wrestler
without
a
pause
we
donned
our
tunics
on
our
dusty
bodies
and
started
on
our
courses
of
literature
mathematics
geography
and
history
on
our
return
from
school
our
drawing
and
gymnastic
masters
would
be
ready
for
us
in
the
evening
aghore
babu
came
for
our
english
lessons
it
was
only
after
nine
that
we
were
free
on
sunday
morning
we
had
singing
lessons
with
vishnu
then
almost
every
sunday
came
sitanath
dutta
to
give
us
demonstrations
in
physical
science
the
last
were
of
great
interest
to
me
i
remember
distinctly
the
feeling
of
wonder
which
filled
me
when
he
put
some
water
with
sawdust
in
it
on
the
fire
in
a
glass
vessel
and
showed
us
how
the
lightened
hot
water
came
up
and
the
cold
water
went
down
and
how
finally
the
water
began
to
boil
i
also
felt
a
great
elation
the
day
i
learnt
that
water
is
a
separable
part
of
milk
and
that
milk
thickens
when
boiled
because
the
water
frees
itself
as
vapour
from
the
connexion
sunday
did
not
feel
unless
sitanath
babu
turned
up
there
was
also
an
hour
when
we
would
be
told
all
about
human
bones
by
a
pupil
of
the
campbell
medical
school
for
which
purpose
a
skeleton
with
the
bones
fastened
together
by
wires
was
hung
up
in
our
schoolroom
and
finally
time
was
also
found
for
pandit
heramba
tatwaratna
to
come
and
get
us
to
learn
by
rote
rules
of
sanscrit
grammar
i
am
not
sure
which
of
them
the
names
of
the
bones
or
the
of
the
grammarian
were
the
more
i
think
the
latter
took
the
palm
we
began
to
learn
english
after
we
had
made
considerable
progress
in
learning
through
the
medium
of
bengali
aghore
babu
our
english
tutor
was
attending
the
medical
college
so
he
came
to
teach
us
in
the
evening
books
tell
us
that
the
discovery
of
fire
was
one
of
the
biggest
discoveries
of
man
i
do
not
wish
to
dispute
this
but
i
can
not
help
feeling
how
fortunate
the
little
birds
are
that
their
parents
can
not
light
lamps
of
an
evening
they
have
their
language
lessons
early
in
the
morning
and
you
must
have
noticed
how
gleefully
they
learn
them
of
course
we
must
not
forget
that
they
do
not
have
to
learn
the
english
language
the
health
of
this
tutor
of
ours
was
so
good
that
even
the
fervent
and
united
wishes
of
his
three
pupils
were
not
enough
to
cause
his
absence
even
for
a
day
only
once
was
he
laid
up
with
a
broken
head
when
on
the
occasion
of
a
fight
between
the
indian
and
eurasian
students
of
the
medical
college
a
chair
was
thrown
at
him
it
was
a
regrettable
occurrence
nevertheless
we
were
not
able
to
take
it
as
a
personal
sorrow
and
his
recovery
somehow
seemed
to
us
needlessly
swift
it
is
evening
the
rain
is
pouring
in
showers
our
lane
is
under
water
the
tank
has
overflown
into
the
garden
and
the
bushy
tops
of
the
bael
trees
are
seen
standing
out
over
the
waters
our
whole
being
on
this
delightful
rainy
evening
is
radiating
rapture
like
the
flower
its
fragrant
spikes
the
time
for
the
arrival
of
our
tutor
is
over
by
just
a
few
minutes
yet
there
is
no
certainty
we
are
sitting
on
the
verandah
overlooking
the
lane
watching
and
watching
with
a
piteous
gaze
all
of
a
sudden
with
a
great
big
thump
our
hearts
seem
to
fall
in
a
swoon
the
familiar
black
umbrella
has
turned
the
corner
undefeated
even
by
such
weather
could
it
not
be
somebody
else
it
certainly
could
not
in
the
wide
wide
world
there
might
be
found
another
his
equal
in
pertinacity
but
never
in
this
little
lane
of
ours
looking
back
on
his
period
as
a
whole
i
can
not
say
that
aghore
babu
was
a
hard
man
he
did
not
rule
us
with
a
rod
even
his
rebukes
did
not
amount
to
scoldings
but
whatever
may
have
been
his
personal
merits
his
time
was
and
his
subject
i
am
certain
that
even
an
angel
would
have
seemed
a
veritable
messenger
of
yama
to
any
bengali
boy
if
he
came
to
him
at
the
end
of
his
miserable
day
at
school
and
lighted
a
dismally
dim
lamp
to
teach
him
english
how
well
do
i
remember
the
day
our
tutor
tried
to
impress
on
us
the
attractiveness
of
the
english
language
with
this
object
he
recited
to
us
with
great
unction
some
lines
prose
or
poetry
we
could
not
tell
out
of
an
english
book
it
had
a
most
unlooked
for
effect
on
us
we
laughed
so
immoderately
that
he
had
to
dismiss
us
for
that
evening
he
must
have
realised
that
he
held
no
easy
brief
that
to
get
us
to
pronounce
in
his
favour
would
entail
a
contest
ranging
over
years
aghore
babu
would
sometimes
try
to
bring
the
zephyr
of
outside
knowledge
to
play
on
the
arid
routine
of
our
schoolroom
one
day
he
brought
a
paper
parcel
out
of
his
pocket
and
said
i
show
you
a
wonderful
piece
of
work
of
the
creator
with
this
he
untied
the
paper
wrapping
and
producing
a
portion
of
the
vocal
organs
of
a
human
being
proceeded
to
expound
the
marvels
of
its
mechanism
i
can
still
call
to
mind
the
shock
this
gave
me
at
the
time
i
had
always
thought
the
whole
man
spoke
had
never
even
imagined
that
the
act
of
speech
could
be
viewed
in
this
detached
way
however
wonderful
the
mechanism
of
a
part
may
be
it
is
certainly
less
so
than
the
whole
man
not
that
i
put
it
to
myself
in
so
many
words
but
that
was
the
cause
of
my
dismay
it
was
perhaps
because
the
tutor
had
lost
sight
of
this
truth
that
the
pupil
could
not
respond
to
the
enthusiasm
with
which
he
was
discoursing
on
the
subject
another
day
he
took
us
to
the
dissecting
room
of
the
medical
college
the
body
of
an
old
woman
was
stretched
on
the
table
this
did
not
disturb
me
so
much
but
an
amputated
leg
which
was
lying
on
the
floor
upset
me
altogether
to
view
man
in
this
fragmentary
way
seemed
to
me
so
horrid
so
absurd
that
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
impression
of
that
dark
unmeaning
leg
for
many
a
day
after
getting
through
peary
sarkar
first
and
second
english
readers
we
entered
upon
mcculloch
course
of
reading
our
bodies
were
weary
at
the
end
of
the
day
our
minds
yearning
for
the
inner
apartments
the
book
was
black
and
thick
with
difficult
words
and
the
could
hardly
have
been
more
inviting
for
in
those
days
mother
saraswati
maternal
tenderness
was
not
in
evidence
books
were
not
full
of
pictures
then
as
they
are
now
moreover
at
the
gateway
of
every
reading
lesson
stood
sentinel
an
array
of
words
with
separated
syllables
and
forbidding
accent
marks
like
fixed
bayonets
barring
the
way
to
the
infant
mind
i
had
repeatedly
attacked
their
serried
ranks
in
vain
our
tutor
would
try
to
shame
us
by
recounting
the
exploits
of
some
other
brilliant
pupil
of
his
we
felt
duly
ashamed
and
also
not
towards
that
other
pupil
but
this
did
not
help
to
dispel
the
darkness
which
clung
to
that
black
volume
providence
out
of
pity
for
mankind
has
instilled
a
soporific
charm
into
all
tedious
things
no
sooner
did
our
english
lessons
begin
than
our
heads
began
to
nod
sprinkling
water
into
our
eyes
or
taking
a
run
round
the
verandahs
were
palliatives
which
had
no
lasting
effect
if
by
any
chance
my
eldest
brother
happened
to
be
passing
that
way
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
our
condition
we
would
get
let
off
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
it
did
not
take
our
drowsiness
another
moment
to
get
completely
cured
first
once
when
the
dengue
fever
was
raging
in
calcutta
some
portion
of
our
extensive
family
had
to
take
shelter
in
chhatu
babu
villa
we
were
among
them
this
was
my
first
outing
the
bank
of
the
ganges
welcomed
me
into
its
lap
like
a
friend
of
a
former
birth
there
in
front
of
the
quarters
was
a
grove
of
guava
trees
and
sitting
in
the
verandah
under
the
shade
of
these
gazing
at
the
flowing
current
through
the
gaps
between
their
trunks
my
days
would
pass
every
morning
as
i
awoke
i
somehow
felt
the
day
coming
to
me
like
a
new
letter
with
some
news
awaiting
me
on
the
opening
of
the
envelope
and
lest
i
should
lose
any
fragment
of
it
i
would
hurry
through
my
toilet
to
my
chair
outside
every
day
there
was
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
tide
on
the
ganges
the
various
gait
of
so
many
different
boats
the
shifting
of
the
shadows
of
the
trees
from
west
to
east
and
over
the
fringe
of
of
the
woods
on
the
opposite
bank
the
gush
of
golden
through
the
pierced
breast
of
the
evening
sky
some
days
would
be
cloudy
from
early
morning
the
opposite
woods
black
black
shadows
moving
over
the
river
then
with
a
rush
would
come
the
vociferous
rain
blotting
out
the
horizon
the
dim
line
of
the
other
bank
taking
its
leave
in
tears
the
river
swelling
with
suppressed
heavings
and
the
moist
wind
making
free
with
the
foliage
of
the
trees
overhead
i
felt
that
out
of
the
bowels
of
wall
beam
and
rafter
i
had
a
new
birth
into
the
outside
in
making
fresh
acquaintance
with
things
the
dingy
covering
of
petty
habits
seemed
to
drop
off
the
world
i
am
sure
that
the
molasses
which
i
had
with
cold
for
my
breakfast
could
not
have
tasted
different
from
the
ambrosia
which
quaffs
in
his
heaven
for
the
immortality
is
not
in
the
nectar
but
in
the
taster
and
thus
is
missed
by
those
who
seek
it
behind
the
house
was
a
enclosure
with
a
tank
and
a
flight
of
steps
leading
into
the
water
from
a
bathing
platform
on
one
side
of
the
platform
was
an
immense
jambolan
tree
and
all
round
were
various
fruit
trees
growing
in
thick
clusters
in
the
shade
of
which
the
tank
nestled
in
its
privacy
the
veiled
beauty
of
this
retired
little
inner
garden
had
a
wonderful
charm
for
me
so
different
from
the
broad
expanse
of
the
in
front
it
was
like
the
bride
of
the
house
in
the
seclusion
of
her
midday
siesta
resting
on
a
quilt
of
her
own
embroidering
murmuring
low
the
secrets
of
her
heart
many
a
midday
hour
did
i
spend
alone
under
that
jambolan
tree
dreaming
of
the
fearsome
kingdom
of
the
yakshas
within
the
depths
of
the
tank
i
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
a
bengal
village
its
clusters
of
cottages
its
thatched
pavilions
its
lanes
and
bathing
places
its
games
and
gatherings
its
fields
and
markets
its
life
as
a
whole
as
i
saw
it
in
imagination
greatly
attracted
me
just
such
a
village
was
right
on
the
other
side
of
our
garden
wall
but
it
was
forbidden
to
us
we
had
come
out
but
not
into
freedom
we
had
been
in
a
cage
and
were
now
on
a
perch
but
the
chain
was
still
there
one
morning
two
of
our
elders
went
out
for
a
stroll
into
the
village
i
could
not
restrain
my
eagerness
any
longer
and
slipping
out
unperceived
followed
them
for
some
distance
as
i
went
along
the
deeply
shaded
lane
with
its
close
thorny
hedges
by
the
side
of
the
tank
covered
with
green
water
weeds
i
rapturously
took
in
picture
after
picture
i
still
remember
the
man
with
bare
body
engaged
in
a
belated
toilet
on
the
edge
of
the
tank
cleaning
his
teeth
with
the
chewed
end
of
a
twig
suddenly
my
elders
became
aware
of
my
presence
behind
them
get
away
get
away
go
back
at
once
they
scolded
they
were
scandalised
my
feet
were
bare
i
had
no
scarf
or
over
my
tunic
i
was
not
dressed
fit
to
come
out
as
if
it
was
my
fault
i
never
owned
any
socks
or
superfluous
apparel
so
not
only
went
back
disappointed
for
that
morning
but
had
no
chance
of
repairing
my
shortcomings
and
being
allowed
to
come
out
any
other
day
however
though
the
beyond
was
thus
shut
out
from
behind
in
front
the
ganges
freed
me
from
all
bondage
and
my
mind
whenever
it
listed
could
embark
on
the
boats
gaily
sailing
along
and
hie
away
to
lands
not
named
in
any
geography
this
was
forty
years
ago
since
then
i
have
never
set
foot
again
in
that
villa
garden
the
same
old
house
and
the
same
old
trees
must
still
be
there
but
i
know
it
can
not
any
longer
be
the
same
for
where
am
i
now
to
get
that
fresh
feeling
of
wonder
which
made
it
what
it
was
we
returned
to
our
jorasanko
house
in
town
and
my
days
were
as
so
many
mouthfuls
offered
up
to
be
gulped
down
into
the
yawning
interior
of
the
normal
school
that
blue
manuscript
book
was
soon
filled
like
the
hive
of
some
insect
with
a
network
of
variously
slanting
lines
and
the
thick
and
thin
strokes
of
letters
the
eager
pressure
of
the
boy
writer
soon
crumpled
its
leaves
and
then
the
edges
got
frayed
and
twisted
up
as
if
to
hold
fast
the
writing
within
till
at
last
down
what
river
i
know
not
its
pages
were
swept
away
by
merciful
oblivion
anyhow
they
escaped
the
pangs
of
a
passage
through
the
printing
press
and
need
fear
no
birth
into
this
vale
of
woe
i
can
not
claim
to
have
been
a
passive
witness
of
the
spread
of
my
reputation
as
a
poet
though
satkari
babu
was
not
a
teacher
of
our
class
he
was
very
fond
of
me
he
had
written
a
book
on
natural
history
wherein
i
hope
no
unkind
humorist
will
try
to
find
a
reason
for
such
fondness
he
sent
for
me
one
day
and
asked
so
you
write
poetry
do
you
i
did
not
conceal
the
fact
from
that
time
on
he
would
now
and
then
ask
me
to
complete
a
quatrain
by
adding
a
couplet
of
my
own
to
one
given
by
him
gobinda
babu
of
our
school
was
very
dark
and
short
and
fat
he
was
the
superintendent
he
sat
in
his
black
suit
with
his
account
books
in
an
office
room
on
the
second
storey
we
were
all
afraid
of
him
for
he
was
the
judge
on
one
occasion
i
had
escaped
from
the
attentions
of
some
bullies
into
his
room
the
persecutors
were
five
or
six
older
boys
i
had
no
one
to
bear
witness
on
my
side
except
my
tears
i
won
my
case
and
since
then
govinda
babu
had
a
soft
corner
in
his
heart
for
me
one
day
he
called
me
into
his
room
during
the
recess
i
went
in
fear
and
trembling
but
had
no
sooner
stepped
before
him
than
he
also
accosted
me
with
the
question
so
you
write
poetry
i
did
not
hesitate
to
make
the
admission
he
commissioned
me
to
write
a
poem
on
some
high
moral
precept
which
i
do
not
remember
the
amount
of
condescension
and
affability
which
such
a
request
coming
from
him
implied
can
only
be
appreciated
by
those
who
were
his
pupils
when
i
finished
and
handed
him
the
verses
next
day
he
took
me
to
the
highest
class
and
made
me
stand
before
the
boys
recite
he
commanded
and
i
recited
loudly
the
only
praiseworthy
thing
about
this
moral
poem
was
that
it
soon
got
lost
its
moral
effect
on
that
class
was
far
from
encouraging
the
sentiment
it
aroused
being
not
one
of
regard
for
its
author
most
of
them
were
certain
that
it
was
not
my
own
composition
one
said
he
could
produce
the
book
from
which
it
was
copied
but
was
not
pressed
to
do
so
the
process
of
proving
is
such
a
nuisance
to
those
who
want
to
believe
finally
the
number
of
seekers
after
poetic
fame
began
to
increase
alarmingly
moreover
their
methods
were
not
those
which
are
recognised
as
roads
to
moral
improvement
nowadays
there
is
nothing
strange
in
a
youngster
writing
verses
the
glamour
of
poesy
is
gone
i
remember
how
the
few
women
who
wrote
poetry
in
those
days
were
looked
upon
as
miraculous
creations
of
the
deity
if
one
hears
that
some
young
lady
does
not
write
poems
one
feels
sceptical
poetry
now
sprouts
long
before
the
highest
bengali
class
is
reached
so
that
no
modern
gobinda
babu
would
have
taken
any
notice
of
the
poetic
exploit
i
have
recounted
part
iii
at
this
time
i
was
blessed
with
a
hearer
the
like
of
whom
i
shall
never
get
again
he
had
so
inordinate
a
capacity
for
being
pleased
as
to
have
utterly
disqualified
him
for
the
post
of
critic
in
any
of
our
monthly
reviews
the
old
man
was
like
a
perfectly
ripe
alfonso
mango
not
a
trace
of
acid
or
coarse
fibre
in
his
composition
his
tender
face
was
rounded
off
by
an
baldness
there
was
not
the
vestige
of
a
tooth
to
worry
the
inside
of
his
mouth
and
his
big
smiling
eyes
gleamed
with
a
constant
delight
when
he
spoke
in
his
soft
deep
voice
his
mouth
and
eyes
and
hands
all
spoke
likewise
he
was
of
the
old
school
of
persian
culture
and
knew
not
a
word
of
english
his
inseparable
companions
were
a
at
his
left
and
a
on
his
lap
and
from
his
throat
flowed
song
unceasing
srikantha
babu
had
no
need
to
wait
for
a
formal
introduction
for
none
could
resist
the
natural
claims
of
his
genial
heart
once
he
took
us
to
be
photographed
with
him
in
some
big
english
photographic
studio
there
he
so
captivated
the
proprietor
with
his
artless
story
in
a
jumble
of
hindusthani
and
bengali
of
how
he
was
a
poor
man
but
badly
wanted
this
particular
photograph
taken
that
the
man
smilingly
allowed
him
a
reduced
rate
nor
did
such
bargaining
sound
at
all
incongruous
in
that
unbending
english
establishment
so
naïve
was
srikantha
babu
so
unconscious
of
any
possibility
of
giving
offence
he
would
sometimes
take
me
along
to
a
european
missionary
house
there
also
with
his
playing
and
singing
his
caresses
of
the
missionary
little
girl
and
his
unstinted
admiration
of
the
little
booted
feet
of
the
lady
he
would
enliven
the
gathering
as
no
one
else
could
have
done
another
behaving
so
absurdly
would
have
been
deemed
a
bore
but
his
transparent
simplicity
pleased
all
and
drew
them
to
join
in
his
gaiety
srikantha
babu
was
impervious
to
rudeness
or
insolence
there
was
at
the
time
a
singer
of
some
repute
retained
in
our
establishment
when
the
latter
was
the
worse
for
liquor
he
would
rail
at
poor
srikantha
singing
in
no
very
choice
terms
this
he
would
bear
unflinchingly
with
no
attempt
at
retort
when
at
last
the
man
incorrigible
rudeness
brought
about
his
dismissal
srikantha
babu
anxiously
interceded
for
him
it
was
not
he
it
was
the
liquor
he
insisted
illustration
the
ganges
he
could
not
bear
to
see
anyone
sorrowing
or
even
to
hear
of
it
so
when
any
one
of
the
boys
wanted
to
torment
him
they
had
only
to
read
out
passages
from
vidyasagar
banishment
of
sita
whereat
he
would
be
greatly
exercised
thrusting
out
his
hands
in
protest
and
begging
and
praying
of
them
to
stop
this
old
man
was
the
friend
alike
of
my
father
my
elder
brothers
and
ourselves
he
was
of
an
age
with
each
and
every
one
of
us
as
any
piece
of
stone
is
good
enough
for
the
freshet
to
dance
round
and
gambol
with
so
the
least
provocation
would
suffice
to
make
him
beside
himself
with
joy
once
i
had
composed
a
hymn
and
had
not
failed
to
make
due
allusion
to
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
this
world
srikantha
babu
was
convinced
that
my
father
would
be
overjoyed
at
such
a
perfect
gem
of
a
devotional
poem
with
unbounded
enthusiasm
he
volunteered
personally
to
acquaint
him
with
it
by
a
piece
of
good
fortune
i
was
not
there
at
the
time
but
heard
afterwards
that
my
father
was
hugely
amused
that
the
sorrows
of
the
world
should
have
so
early
moved
his
youngest
son
to
the
point
of
versification
i
am
sure
gobinda
babu
the
superintendent
would
have
shown
more
respect
for
my
effort
on
so
serious
a
subject
in
singing
i
was
srikantha
babu
favorite
pupil
he
had
taught
me
a
song
no
more
of
vraja
for
me
and
would
drag
me
about
to
everyone
rooms
and
get
me
to
sing
it
to
them
i
would
sing
and
he
would
thrum
an
accompaniment
on
his
and
when
we
came
to
the
chorus
he
would
join
in
and
repeat
it
over
and
over
again
smiling
and
nodding
his
head
at
each
one
in
turn
as
if
nudging
them
on
to
a
more
enthusiastic
appreciation
he
was
a
devoted
admirer
of
my
father
a
hymn
had
been
set
to
one
of
his
tunes
for
he
is
the
heart
of
our
hearts
when
he
sang
this
to
my
father
srikantha
babu
got
so
excited
that
he
jumped
up
from
his
seat
and
in
alternation
violently
twanged
his
as
he
sang
for
he
is
the
heart
of
our
hearts
and
then
waved
his
hand
about
my
father
face
as
he
changed
the
words
to
for
are
the
heart
of
our
hearts
when
the
old
man
paid
his
last
visit
to
my
father
the
latter
himself
was
at
a
villa
in
chinsurah
srikantha
babu
stricken
with
his
last
illness
could
not
rise
unaided
and
had
to
push
open
his
eyelids
to
see
in
this
state
tended
by
his
daughter
he
journeyed
to
chinsurah
from
his
place
in
birbhoom
with
a
great
effort
he
managed
to
take
the
dust
of
my
father
feet
and
then
return
to
his
lodgings
in
chinsurah
where
he
breathed
his
last
a
few
days
later
i
heard
afterwards
from
his
daughter
that
he
went
to
his
eternal
youth
with
the
song
how
sweet
is
thy
mercy
lord
on
his
lips
bengali
course
at
school
we
were
then
in
the
class
below
the
highest
one
at
home
we
had
advanced
in
bengali
much
further
than
the
subjects
taught
in
the
class
we
had
been
through
akshay
datta
book
on
popular
physics
and
had
also
finished
the
epic
of
meghnadvadha
we
read
our
physics
without
any
reference
to
physical
objects
and
so
our
knowledge
of
the
subject
was
correspondingly
bookish
in
fact
the
time
spent
on
it
had
been
thoroughly
wasted
much
more
so
to
my
mind
than
if
it
had
been
wasted
in
doing
nothing
the
meghnadvadha
also
was
not
a
thing
of
joy
to
us
the
tastiest
may
not
be
relished
when
thrown
at
one
head
to
employ
an
epic
to
teach
language
is
like
using
a
sword
to
shave
with
sad
for
the
sword
bad
for
the
chin
a
poem
should
be
taught
from
the
emotional
standpoint
inveigling
it
into
service
as
is
not
calculated
to
propitiate
the
divine
saraswati
all
of
a
sudden
our
normal
school
career
came
to
an
end
and
thereby
hangs
a
tale
one
of
our
school
teachers
wanted
to
borrow
a
copy
of
my
grandfather
life
by
mitra
from
our
library
my
nephew
and
classmate
satya
managed
to
screw
up
courage
enough
to
volunteer
to
mention
this
to
my
father
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
everyday
bengali
would
hardly
do
to
approach
him
with
so
he
concocted
and
delivered
himself
of
an
archaic
phrase
with
such
meticulous
precision
that
my
father
must
have
felt
our
study
of
the
bengali
language
had
gone
a
bit
too
far
and
was
in
danger
of
itself
so
the
next
morning
when
according
to
our
wont
our
table
had
been
placed
in
the
south
verandah
the
blackboard
hung
up
on
a
nail
in
the
wall
and
everything
was
in
readiness
for
our
lessons
with
nilkamal
babu
we
three
were
sent
for
by
my
father
to
his
room
upstairs
you
need
not
do
any
more
bengali
lessons
he
said
our
minds
danced
for
very
joy
nilkamal
babu
was
waiting
downstairs
our
books
were
lying
open
on
the
table
and
the
idea
of
getting
us
once
more
to
go
through
the
meghnadvadha
doubtless
still
occupied
his
mind
but
as
on
the
various
routine
of
daily
life
seems
unreal
so
in
a
moment
did
everything
from
the
pandit
down
to
the
nail
on
which
the
blackboard
was
hung
become
for
us
as
empty
as
a
mirage
our
sole
trouble
was
how
to
give
this
news
to
nilkamal
babu
with
due
decorum
we
did
it
at
last
with
considerable
restraint
while
the
geometrical
figures
on
the
blackboard
stared
at
us
in
wonder
and
the
blank
verse
of
the
meghnadvadha
looked
blankly
on
our
pandit
parting
words
were
at
the
call
of
duty
i
may
have
been
sometimes
harsh
with
you
do
not
keep
that
in
remembrance
you
will
learn
the
value
of
what
i
have
taught
you
later
on
indeed
i
have
learnt
that
value
it
was
because
we
were
taught
in
our
own
language
that
our
minds
quickened
learning
should
as
far
as
possible
follow
the
process
of
eating
when
the
taste
begins
from
the
first
bite
the
stomach
is
awakened
to
its
function
before
it
is
loaded
so
that
its
digestive
juices
get
full
play
nothing
like
this
happens
however
when
the
bengali
boy
is
taught
in
english
the
first
bite
bids
fair
to
wrench
loose
both
rows
of
teeth
like
a
veritable
earthquake
in
the
mouth
and
by
the
time
he
discovers
that
the
morsel
is
not
of
the
genus
stone
but
a
digestible
bonbon
half
his
allotted
span
of
life
is
over
while
one
is
choking
and
spluttering
over
the
spelling
and
grammar
the
inside
remains
starved
and
when
at
length
the
taste
is
felt
the
appetite
has
vanished
if
the
whole
mind
does
not
work
from
the
beginning
its
full
powers
remain
undeveloped
to
the
end
while
all
around
was
the
cry
for
english
teaching
my
third
brother
was
brave
enough
to
keep
us
to
our
bengali
course
to
him
in
heaven
my
grateful
reverence
on
leaving
the
normal
school
we
were
sent
to
the
bengal
academy
a
eurasian
institution
we
felt
we
had
gained
an
access
of
dignity
that
we
had
grown
up
at
least
into
the
first
storey
of
freedom
in
point
of
fact
the
only
progress
we
made
in
that
academy
was
towards
freedom
what
we
were
taught
there
we
never
understood
nor
did
we
make
any
attempt
to
learn
nor
did
it
seem
to
make
any
difference
to
anybody
that
we
did
not
the
boys
here
were
annoying
but
not
disgusting
which
was
a
great
comfort
they
wrote
ass
on
their
palms
and
slapped
it
on
to
our
backs
with
a
cordial
hello
they
gave
us
a
dig
in
the
ribs
from
behind
and
looked
innocently
another
way
they
dabbed
banana
pulp
on
our
heads
and
made
away
unperceived
nevertheless
it
was
like
coming
out
of
slime
on
to
rock
we
were
worried
but
not
soiled
this
school
had
one
great
advantage
for
me
no
one
there
cherished
the
forlorn
hope
that
boys
of
our
sort
could
make
any
advance
in
learning
it
was
a
petty
institution
with
an
insufficient
income
so
that
we
had
one
supreme
merit
in
the
eyes
of
its
authorities
we
paid
our
fees
regularly
this
prevented
even
the
latin
grammar
from
proving
a
stumbling
block
and
the
most
egregious
of
blunders
left
our
backs
unscathed
pity
for
us
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
school
authorities
had
spoken
to
the
teachers
still
harmless
though
it
was
after
all
it
was
a
school
the
rooms
were
cruelly
dismal
with
their
walls
on
guard
like
policemen
the
house
was
more
like
a
box
than
a
human
habitation
no
decoration
no
pictures
not
a
touch
of
colour
not
an
attempt
to
attract
the
boyish
heart
the
fact
that
likes
and
dislikes
form
a
large
part
of
the
child
mind
was
completely
ignored
naturally
our
whole
being
was
depressed
as
we
stepped
through
its
doorway
into
the
narrow
quadrangle
and
playing
truant
became
chronic
with
us
in
this
we
found
an
accomplice
my
elder
brothers
had
a
persian
tutor
we
used
to
call
him
munshi
he
was
of
middle
age
and
all
skin
and
bone
as
though
dark
parchment
had
been
stretched
over
his
skeleton
without
any
filling
of
flesh
and
blood
he
probably
knew
persian
well
his
knowledge
of
english
was
quite
fair
but
in
neither
of
these
directions
lay
his
ambition
his
belief
was
that
his
proficiency
in
singlestick
was
matched
only
by
his
skill
in
song
he
would
stand
in
the
sun
in
the
middle
of
our
courtyard
and
go
through
a
wonderful
series
of
antics
with
a
staff
his
own
shadow
being
his
antagonist
i
need
hardly
add
that
his
shadow
never
got
the
better
of
him
and
when
at
the
end
he
gave
a
great
big
shout
and
whacked
it
on
the
head
with
a
victorious
smile
it
lay
submissively
prone
at
his
feet
his
singing
nasal
and
out
of
tune
sounded
like
a
gruesome
mixture
of
groaning
and
moaning
coming
from
some
our
singing
master
vishnu
would
sometimes
chaff
him
look
here
munshi
you
be
taking
the
bread
out
of
our
mouths
at
this
rate
to
which
his
only
reply
would
be
a
disdainful
smile
this
shows
that
the
munshi
was
amenable
to
soft
words
and
in
fact
whenever
we
wanted
we
could
persuade
him
to
write
to
the
school
authorities
to
excuse
us
from
attendance
the
school
authorities
took
no
pains
to
scrutinise
these
letters
they
knew
it
would
be
all
the
same
whether
we
attended
or
not
so
far
as
educational
results
were
concerned
i
have
now
a
school
of
my
own
in
which
the
boys
are
up
to
all
kinds
of
mischief
for
boys
will
be
mischievous
and
schoolmasters
unforgiving
when
any
of
us
are
beset
with
undue
uneasiness
at
their
conduct
and
are
stirred
into
a
resolution
to
deal
out
condign
punishment
the
misdeeds
of
my
own
schooldays
confront
me
in
a
row
and
smile
at
me
i
now
clearly
see
that
the
mistake
is
to
judge
boys
by
the
standard
of
to
forget
that
a
child
is
quick
and
mobile
like
a
running
stream
and
that
in
the
case
of
such
any
touch
of
imperfection
need
cause
no
great
alarm
for
the
speed
of
the
flow
is
itself
the
best
corrective
when
stagnation
sets
in
then
comes
the
danger
so
it
is
for
the
teacher
more
than
the
pupil
to
beware
of
wrongdoing
there
was
a
separate
refreshment
room
for
bengali
boys
for
meeting
their
caste
requirements
this
was
where
we
struck
up
a
friendship
with
some
of
the
others
they
were
all
older
than
we
one
of
these
will
bear
to
be
dilated
upon
his
specialty
was
the
art
of
magic
so
much
so
that
he
had
actually
written
and
published
a
little
booklet
on
it
the
front
page
of
which
bore
his
name
with
the
title
of
professor
i
had
never
before
come
across
a
schoolboy
whose
name
had
appeared
in
print
so
that
my
reverence
for
him
as
a
professor
of
magic
i
mean
was
profound
how
could
i
have
brought
myself
to
believe
that
anything
questionable
could
possibly
find
place
in
the
straight
and
upright
ranks
of
printed
letters
to
be
able
to
record
one
own
words
in
indelible
ink
was
that
a
slight
thing
to
stand
unscreened
yet
unabashed
before
the
world
how
could
one
withhold
belief
in
the
face
of
such
supreme
i
remember
how
once
i
got
the
types
for
the
letters
of
my
name
from
some
printing
press
and
what
a
memorable
thing
it
seemed
when
i
inked
and
pressed
them
on
paper
and
found
my
name
imprinted
we
used
to
give
a
lift
in
our
carriage
to
this
schoolfellow
and
of
ours
this
led
to
visiting
terms
he
was
also
great
at
theatricals
with
his
help
we
erected
a
stage
on
our
wrestling
ground
with
painted
paper
stretched
over
a
split
bamboo
framework
but
a
peremptory
negative
from
upstairs
prevented
any
play
from
being
acted
thereon
a
comedy
of
errors
was
however
played
later
on
without
any
stage
at
all
the
author
of
this
has
already
been
introduced
to
the
reader
in
these
pages
he
was
none
other
than
my
nephew
satya
those
who
behold
his
present
calm
and
sedate
demeanour
would
be
shocked
to
learn
of
the
tricks
of
which
he
was
the
originator
illustration
satya
the
event
of
which
i
am
writing
happened
sometime
afterwards
when
i
was
twelve
or
thirteen
our
magician
friend
had
told
of
so
many
strange
properties
of
things
that
i
was
consumed
with
curiosity
to
see
them
for
myself
but
the
materials
of
which
he
spoke
were
invariably
so
rare
or
distant
that
one
could
hardly
hope
to
get
hold
of
them
without
the
help
of
sindbad
the
sailor
once
as
it
happened
the
professor
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
mention
accessible
things
who
could
ever
believe
that
a
seed
dipped
and
dried
times
in
the
juice
of
a
species
of
cactus
would
sprout
and
flower
and
fruit
all
in
the
space
of
an
hour
i
was
determined
to
test
this
not
daring
withal
to
doubt
the
assurance
of
a
professor
whose
name
appeared
in
a
printed
book
i
got
our
gardener
to
furnish
me
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
the
milky
juice
and
betook
myself
on
a
sunday
afternoon
to
our
mystic
nook
in
a
corner
of
the
roof
terrace
to
experiment
with
the
stone
of
a
mango
i
was
wrapt
in
my
task
of
dipping
and
drying
but
the
reader
will
probably
not
wait
to
ask
me
the
result
in
the
meantime
i
little
knew
that
satya
in
another
corner
had
in
the
space
of
an
hour
caused
to
root
and
sprout
a
mystical
plant
of
his
own
creation
this
was
to
bear
curious
fruit
later
on
after
the
day
of
this
experiment
the
professor
rather
avoided
me
as
i
gradually
came
to
perceive
he
would
not
sit
on
the
same
side
in
the
carriage
and
altogether
seemed
to
fight
shy
of
me
one
day
all
of
a
sudden
he
proposed
that
each
one
in
turn
should
jump
off
the
bench
in
our
schoolroom
he
wanted
to
observe
the
differences
in
style
he
said
such
scientific
curiosity
did
not
appear
queer
in
a
professor
of
magic
everyone
jumped
so
did
i
he
shook
his
head
with
a
subdued
h
no
amount
of
persuasion
could
draw
anything
further
out
of
him
another
day
he
informed
us
that
some
good
friends
of
his
wanted
to
make
our
acquaintance
and
asked
us
to
accompany
him
to
their
house
our
guardians
had
no
objection
so
off
we
went
the
crowd
in
the
room
seemed
full
of
curiosity
they
expressed
their
eagerness
to
hear
me
sing
i
sang
a
song
or
two
mere
child
as
i
was
i
could
hardly
have
bellowed
like
a
bull
quite
a
sweet
voice
they
all
agreed
when
refreshments
were
put
before
us
they
sat
round
and
watched
us
eat
i
was
bashful
by
nature
and
not
used
to
strange
company
moreover
the
habit
i
acquired
during
the
attendance
of
our
servant
iswar
left
me
a
poor
eater
for
good
they
all
seemed
impressed
with
the
delicacy
of
my
appetite
in
the
fifth
act
i
got
some
curiously
warm
letters
from
our
professor
which
revealed
the
whole
situation
and
here
let
the
curtain
fall
i
subsequently
learnt
from
satya
that
while
i
had
been
practising
magic
on
the
mango
seed
he
had
successfully
convinced
the
professor
that
i
was
dressed
as
a
boy
by
our
guardians
merely
for
getting
me
a
better
schooling
but
that
really
this
was
only
a
disguise
to
those
who
are
curious
in
regard
to
imaginary
science
i
should
explain
that
a
girl
is
supposed
to
jump
with
her
left
foot
forward
and
this
is
what
i
had
done
on
the
occasion
of
the
professor
trial
i
little
realised
at
the
time
what
a
tremendously
false
step
mine
had
been
shortly
after
my
birth
my
father
took
to
constantly
travelling
about
so
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
in
my
early
childhood
i
hardly
knew
him
he
would
now
and
then
come
back
home
all
of
a
sudden
and
with
him
came
foreign
servants
with
whom
i
felt
extremely
eager
to
make
friends
once
there
came
in
this
way
a
young
panjabi
servant
named
lenu
the
cordiality
of
the
reception
he
got
from
us
would
have
been
worthy
of
ranjit
singh
himself
not
only
was
he
a
foreigner
but
a
panjabi
to
boot
what
wonder
he
stole
our
hearts
away
we
had
the
same
reverence
for
the
whole
panjabi
nation
as
for
bhima
and
arjuna
of
the
mahabharata
they
were
warriors
and
if
they
had
sometimes
fought
and
lost
that
was
clearly
the
enemy
fault
it
was
glorious
to
have
lenu
of
the
panjab
in
our
very
home
my
had
a
model
under
a
glass
case
which
when
wound
up
rocked
on
silken
waves
to
the
tinkling
of
a
musical
box
i
would
beg
hard
for
the
loan
of
this
to
display
its
marvels
to
the
admiring
lenu
caged
in
the
house
as
we
were
anything
savouring
of
foreign
parts
had
a
peculiar
charm
for
me
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
i
made
so
much
of
lenu
this
was
also
the
reason
why
gabriel
the
jew
with
his
embroidered
gaberdine
who
came
to
sell
and
scented
oils
stirred
me
so
and
the
huge
kabulis
with
their
dusty
baggy
trousers
and
knapsacks
and
bundles
wrought
on
my
young
mind
a
fearful
fascination
anyhow
when
my
father
came
we
would
be
content
with
wandering
round
about
his
entourage
and
in
the
company
of
his
servants
we
did
not
reach
his
immediate
presence
once
while
my
father
was
away
in
the
himalayas
that
old
bogey
of
the
british
government
the
russian
invasion
came
to
be
a
subject
of
agitated
conversation
among
the
people
some
lady
friend
had
enlarged
on
the
impending
danger
to
my
mother
with
all
the
circumstance
of
a
prolific
imagination
how
could
a
body
tell
from
which
of
the
tibetan
passes
the
russian
host
might
suddenly
flash
forth
like
a
baleful
comet
my
mother
was
seriously
alarmed
possibly
the
other
members
of
the
family
did
not
share
her
misgivings
so
despairing
of
sympathy
she
sought
my
boyish
support
wo
you
write
to
your
father
about
the
russians
she
asked
that
letter
carrying
the
tidings
of
my
mother
anxieties
was
my
first
one
to
my
father
i
did
not
know
how
to
begin
or
end
a
letter
or
anything
at
all
about
it
i
went
to
mahananda
the
estate
munshi
the
resulting
style
of
address
was
doubtless
correct
enough
but
the
sentiments
could
not
have
escaped
the
musty
flavour
inseparable
from
literature
emanating
from
an
estate
office
i
got
a
reply
to
my
letter
my
father
asked
me
not
to
be
afraid
if
the
russians
came
he
would
drive
them
away
himself
this
confident
assurance
did
not
seem
to
have
the
effect
of
relieving
my
mother
fears
but
it
served
to
free
me
from
all
timidity
as
regards
my
father
after
that
i
wanted
to
write
to
him
every
day
and
pestered
mahananda
accordingly
unable
to
withstand
my
importunity
he
would
make
out
drafts
for
me
to
copy
but
i
did
not
know
that
there
was
the
postage
to
be
paid
for
i
had
an
idea
that
letters
placed
in
mahananda
hands
got
to
their
destination
without
any
need
for
further
worry
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
mention
that
mahananda
being
considerably
older
than
myself
these
letters
never
reached
the
himalayan
when
after
his
long
absences
my
father
came
home
even
for
a
few
days
the
whole
house
seemed
filled
with
the
weight
of
his
presence
we
would
see
our
elders
at
certain
hours
formally
robed
in
their
passing
to
his
rooms
with
restrained
gait
and
sobered
mien
casting
away
any
they
might
have
been
chewing
everyone
seemed
on
the
alert
to
make
sure
of
nothing
going
wrong
my
mother
would
superintend
the
cooking
herself
the
old
kinu
with
his
white
livery
and
crested
turban
on
guard
at
my
father
door
would
warn
us
not
to
be
boisterous
in
the
verandah
in
front
of
his
rooms
during
his
midday
siesta
we
had
to
walk
past
quietly
talking
in
whispers
and
dared
not
even
take
a
peep
inside
on
one
occasion
my
father
came
home
to
invest
the
three
of
us
with
the
sacred
thread
with
the
help
of
pandit
vedantavagish
he
had
collected
the
old
vedic
rites
for
the
purpose
for
days
together
we
were
taught
to
chant
in
correct
accents
the
selections
from
the
upanishads
arranged
by
my
father
under
the
name
of
brahma
dharma
seated
in
the
prayer
hall
with
becharam
babu
finally
with
shaven
heads
and
gold
rings
in
our
ears
we
three
budding
brahmins
went
into
a
retreat
in
a
portion
of
the
third
storey
it
was
great
fun
the
earrings
gave
us
a
good
handle
to
pull
each
other
ears
with
we
found
a
little
drum
lying
in
one
of
the
rooms
taking
this
we
would
stand
out
in
the
verandah
and
when
we
caught
sight
of
any
servant
passing
alone
in
the
storey
below
we
would
rap
a
tattoo
on
it
this
would
make
the
man
look
up
only
to
beat
a
hasty
retreat
the
next
moment
with
averted
eyes
in
short
we
can
not
claim
that
these
days
of
our
retirement
were
passed
in
ascetic
meditation
i
am
however
persuaded
that
boys
like
ourselves
could
not
have
been
rare
in
the
hermitages
of
old
and
if
some
ancient
document
has
it
that
the
ten
or
old
saradwata
or
sarngarava
is
spending
the
whole
of
the
days
of
his
boyhood
offering
oblations
and
chanting
we
are
not
compelled
to
put
unquestioning
faith
in
the
statement
because
the
book
of
boy
nature
is
even
older
and
also
more
authentic
after
we
had
attained
full
brahminhood
i
became
very
keen
on
repeating
the
i
would
meditate
on
it
with
great
concentration
it
is
hardly
a
text
the
full
meaning
of
which
i
could
have
grasped
at
that
age
i
well
remember
what
efforts
i
made
to
extend
the
range
of
my
consciousness
with
the
help
of
the
initial
invocation
of
earth
firmament
and
heaven
how
i
felt
or
thought
it
is
difficult
to
express
clearly
but
this
much
is
certain
that
to
be
clear
about
the
meaning
of
words
is
not
the
most
important
function
of
the
human
understanding
the
main
object
of
teaching
is
not
to
explain
meanings
but
to
knock
at
the
door
of
the
mind
if
any
boy
is
asked
to
give
an
account
of
what
is
awakened
in
him
at
such
knocking
he
will
probably
say
something
very
silly
for
what
happens
within
is
much
bigger
than
what
he
can
express
in
words
those
who
pin
their
faith
on
university
examinations
as
a
test
of
all
educational
results
take
no
account
of
this
fact
i
can
recollect
many
things
which
i
did
not
understand
but
which
stirred
me
deeply
once
on
the
roof
terrace
of
our
villa
my
eldest
brother
at
the
sudden
gathering
of
clouds
repeated
aloud
some
stanzas
from
kalidas
cloud
messenger
i
could
not
nor
had
i
the
need
to
understand
a
word
of
the
sanskrit
his
ecstatic
declamation
of
the
sonorous
rhythm
was
enough
for
me
then
again
before
i
could
properly
understand
english
a
profusely
illustrated
edition
of
the
old
curiosity
shop
fell
into
my
hands
i
went
through
the
whole
of
it
though
at
least
of
the
words
were
unknown
to
me
yet
with
the
vague
ideas
i
conjured
up
from
the
rest
i
spun
out
a
variously
coloured
thread
on
which
to
string
the
illustrations
any
university
examiner
would
have
given
me
a
great
big
zero
but
the
reading
of
the
book
had
not
proved
for
me
quite
so
empty
as
all
that
another
time
i
had
accompanied
my
father
on
a
trip
on
the
ganges
in
his
houseboat
among
the
books
he
had
with
him
was
an
old
fort
william
edition
of
jayadeva
it
was
in
the
bengali
character
the
verses
were
not
printed
in
separate
lines
but
ran
on
like
prose
i
did
not
then
know
anything
of
sanskrit
yet
because
of
my
knowledge
of
bengali
many
of
the
words
were
familiar
i
can
not
tell
how
often
i
read
that
i
can
well
remember
this
line
the
night
that
was
passed
in
the
lonely
forest
cottage
it
spread
an
atmosphere
of
vague
beauty
over
my
mind
that
one
sanskrit
word
meaning
the
lonely
forest
cottage
was
quite
enough
for
me
i
had
to
discover
for
myself
the
intricate
metre
of
jayadeva
because
its
divisions
were
lost
in
the
clumsy
prose
form
of
the
book
and
this
discovery
gave
me
very
great
delight
of
course
i
did
not
fully
comprehend
jayadeva
meaning
it
would
hardly
be
correct
to
aver
that
i
had
got
it
even
partly
but
the
sound
of
the
words
and
the
lilt
of
the
metre
filled
my
mind
with
pictures
of
wonderful
beauty
which
impelled
me
to
copy
out
the
whole
of
the
book
for
my
own
use
the
same
thing
happened
when
i
was
a
little
older
with
a
verse
from
kalidas
birth
of
the
war
god
the
verse
moved
me
greatly
though
the
only
words
of
which
i
gathered
the
sense
were
the
breeze
carrying
the
of
the
falling
waters
of
the
sacred
mandakini
and
shaking
the
deodar
leaves
these
left
me
pining
to
taste
the
beauties
of
the
whole
when
later
a
pandit
explained
to
me
that
in
the
next
two
lines
the
breeze
went
on
splitting
the
feathers
of
the
peacock
plume
on
the
head
of
the
eager
the
thinness
of
this
last
conceit
disappointed
me
i
was
much
better
off
when
i
had
relied
only
upon
my
imagination
to
complete
the
verse
whoever
goes
back
to
his
early
childhood
will
agree
that
his
greatest
gains
were
not
in
proportion
to
the
completeness
of
his
understanding
our
kathakas
i
know
this
truth
well
so
their
narratives
always
have
a
good
proportion
of
sanskrit
words
and
abstruse
remarks
not
calculated
to
be
fully
understood
by
their
simple
hearers
but
only
to
be
suggestive
the
value
of
such
suggestion
is
by
no
means
to
be
despised
by
those
who
measure
education
in
terms
of
material
gains
and
losses
these
insist
on
trying
to
sum
up
the
account
and
find
out
exactly
how
much
of
the
lesson
imparted
can
be
rendered
up
but
children
and
those
who
are
not
dwell
in
that
primal
paradise
where
men
can
come
to
know
without
fully
comprehending
each
step
and
only
when
that
paradise
is
lost
comes
the
evil
day
when
everything
needs
must
be
understood
the
road
which
leads
to
knowledge
without
going
through
the
dreary
process
of
understanding
that
is
the
royal
road
if
that
be
barred
though
the
world
marketing
may
yet
go
on
as
usual
the
open
sea
and
the
mountain
top
cease
to
be
possible
of
access
so
as
i
was
saying
though
at
that
age
i
could
not
realise
the
full
meaning
of
the
there
was
something
in
me
which
could
do
without
a
complete
understanding
i
am
reminded
of
a
day
when
as
i
was
seated
on
the
cement
floor
in
a
corner
of
our
schoolroom
meditating
on
the
text
my
eyes
overflowed
with
tears
why
those
tears
came
i
knew
not
and
to
a
strict
i
would
probably
have
given
some
explanation
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
what
is
going
on
in
the
inner
recesses
of
consciousness
is
not
always
known
to
the
dweller
on
the
surface
journey
with
my
my
shaven
head
after
the
sacred
thread
ceremony
caused
me
one
great
anxiety
however
partial
eurasian
lads
may
be
to
things
appertaining
to
the
cow
their
reverence
for
the
brahmin
is
notoriously
lacking
so
that
apart
from
other
missiles
our
shaven
heads
were
sure
to
be
pelted
with
jeers
while
i
was
worrying
over
this
possibility
i
was
one
day
summoned
upstairs
to
my
father
how
would
i
like
to
go
with
him
to
the
himalayas
i
was
asked
away
from
the
bengal
academy
and
off
to
the
himalayas
would
i
like
it
o
that
i
could
have
rent
the
skies
with
a
shout
that
might
have
given
some
idea
of
the
how
on
the
day
of
our
leaving
home
my
father
as
was
his
habit
assembled
the
whole
family
in
the
prayer
hall
for
divine
service
after
i
had
taken
the
dust
of
the
feet
of
my
elders
i
got
into
the
carriage
with
my
father
this
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
had
a
full
suit
of
clothes
made
for
me
my
father
himself
had
selected
the
pattern
and
colour
a
gold
embroidered
velvet
cap
completed
my
costume
this
i
carried
in
my
hand
being
assailed
with
misgivings
as
to
its
effect
in
juxtaposition
to
my
hairless
head
as
i
got
into
the
carriage
my
father
insisted
on
my
wearing
it
so
i
had
to
put
it
on
every
time
he
looked
another
way
i
took
it
off
every
time
i
caught
his
eye
it
had
to
resume
its
proper
place
my
father
was
very
particular
in
all
his
arrangements
and
orderings
he
disliked
leaving
things
vague
or
undetermined
and
never
allowed
slovenliness
or
makeshifts
he
had
a
code
to
regulate
his
relations
with
others
and
theirs
with
him
in
this
he
was
different
from
the
generality
of
his
countrymen
with
the
rest
of
us
a
little
carelessness
this
way
or
that
did
not
signify
so
in
our
dealings
with
him
we
had
to
be
anxiously
careful
it
was
not
so
much
the
little
less
or
more
that
he
objected
to
as
the
failure
to
be
up
to
the
standard
my
father
had
also
a
way
of
picturing
to
himself
every
detail
of
what
he
wanted
done
on
the
occasion
of
any
ceremonial
gathering
at
which
he
could
not
be
present
he
would
think
out
and
assign
the
place
for
each
thing
the
duty
for
each
member
of
the
family
the
seat
for
each
guest
nothing
would
escape
him
after
it
was
all
over
he
would
ask
each
one
for
a
separate
account
and
thus
gain
a
complete
impression
of
the
whole
for
himself
so
while
i
was
with
him
on
his
travels
though
nothing
would
induce
him
to
put
obstacles
in
the
way
of
my
amusing
myself
as
i
pleased
he
left
no
loophole
in
the
strict
rules
of
conduct
which
he
prescribed
for
me
in
other
respects
our
first
halt
was
to
be
for
a
few
days
at
bolpur
satya
had
been
there
a
short
time
before
with
his
parents
no
nineteenth
century
infant
would
have
credited
the
account
of
his
travels
which
he
gave
us
on
his
return
but
we
were
different
and
had
had
no
opportunity
of
learning
to
determine
the
line
between
the
possible
and
the
impossible
our
mahabharata
and
ramayana
gave
us
no
clue
to
it
nor
had
we
then
any
children
illustrated
books
to
guide
us
in
the
way
a
child
should
go
all
the
hard
and
fast
laws
which
govern
the
world
we
learnt
by
knocking
up
against
them
satya
had
told
us
that
unless
one
was
very
very
expert
getting
into
a
railway
carriage
was
a
terribly
dangerous
affair
the
least
slip
and
it
was
all
up
then
again
a
fellow
had
to
hold
on
to
his
seat
with
all
his
might
otherwise
the
jolt
at
starting
was
so
tremendous
there
was
no
telling
where
one
would
get
thrown
off
to
so
when
we
got
to
the
railway
station
i
was
all
so
easily
did
we
get
into
our
compartment
however
that
i
felt
sure
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
and
when
at
length
we
made
an
absurdly
smooth
start
without
any
semblance
of
adventure
i
felt
woefully
disappointed
the
train
sped
on
the
broad
fields
with
their
border
trees
and
the
villages
nestling
in
their
shade
flew
past
in
a
stream
of
pictures
which
melted
away
like
a
flood
of
mirages
it
was
evening
when
we
reached
bolpur
as
i
got
into
the
palanquin
i
closed
my
eyes
i
wanted
to
preserve
the
whole
of
the
wonderful
vision
to
be
unfolded
before
my
waking
eyes
in
the
morning
light
the
freshness
of
the
experience
would
be
spoilt
i
feared
by
incomplete
glimpses
caught
in
the
vagueness
of
the
dusk
when
i
woke
at
dawn
my
heart
was
thrilling
tremulously
as
i
stepped
outside
my
predecessor
had
told
me
that
bolpur
had
one
feature
which
was
to
be
found
nowhere
else
in
the
world
this
was
the
path
leading
from
the
main
buildings
to
the
servants
quarters
which
though
not
covered
over
in
any
way
did
not
allow
a
ray
of
the
sun
or
a
drop
of
rain
to
touch
anybody
passing
along
it
i
started
to
hunt
for
this
wonderful
path
but
the
reader
will
perhaps
not
wonder
at
my
failure
to
find
it
to
this
day
town
bred
as
i
was
i
had
never
seen
a
and
i
had
a
charming
portrait
of
the
cowherd
boy
of
whom
we
had
read
pictured
on
the
canvas
of
my
imagination
i
had
heard
from
satya
that
the
bolpur
house
was
surrounded
by
fields
of
ripening
rice
and
that
playing
in
these
with
cowherd
boys
was
an
everyday
affair
of
which
the
plucking
cooking
and
eating
of
the
rice
was
the
crowning
feature
i
eagerly
looked
about
me
but
where
oh
where
was
the
on
all
that
barren
heath
cowherd
boys
there
might
have
been
somewhere
about
yet
how
to
distinguish
them
from
any
other
boys
that
was
the
question
however
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
get
over
what
i
could
not
see
what
i
did
see
was
quite
enough
there
was
no
servant
rule
here
and
the
only
ring
which
encircled
me
was
the
blue
of
the
horizon
which
the
presiding
goddess
of
these
solitudes
had
drawn
round
them
within
this
i
was
free
to
move
about
as
i
chose
though
i
was
yet
a
mere
child
my
father
did
not
place
any
restriction
on
my
wanderings
in
the
hollows
of
the
sandy
soil
the
rainwater
had
ploughed
deep
furrows
carving
out
miniature
mountain
ranges
full
of
red
gravel
and
pebbles
of
various
shapes
through
which
ran
tiny
streams
revealing
the
geography
of
lilliput
from
this
region
i
would
gather
in
the
lap
of
my
tunic
many
curious
pieces
of
stone
and
take
the
collection
to
my
father
he
never
made
light
of
my
labours
on
the
contrary
he
waxed
enthusiastic
how
wonderful
he
exclaimed
wherever
did
you
get
all
these
there
are
many
many
more
thousands
and
thousands
i
burst
out
i
could
bring
as
many
every
day
that
be
nice
he
replied
why
not
decorate
my
little
hill
with
them
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
dig
a
tank
in
the
garden
but
the
subsoil
water
proving
too
low
it
had
been
abandoned
unfinished
with
the
excavated
earth
left
piled
up
into
a
hillock
on
the
top
of
this
height
my
father
used
to
sit
for
his
morning
prayer
and
as
he
sat
the
sun
would
rise
at
the
edge
of
the
undulating
expanse
which
stretched
away
to
the
eastern
horizon
in
front
of
him
this
was
the
hill
he
asked
me
to
decorate
i
was
very
troubled
on
leaving
bolpur
that
i
could
not
carry
away
with
me
my
store
of
stones
it
is
still
difficult
for
me
to
realise
that
i
have
no
absolute
claim
to
keep
up
a
close
relationship
with
things
merely
because
i
have
gathered
them
together
if
my
fate
had
granted
me
the
prayer
which
i
had
pressed
with
such
insistence
and
undertaken
that
i
should
carry
this
load
of
stones
about
with
me
for
ever
then
i
should
scarcely
have
had
the
hardihood
to
laugh
at
it
in
one
of
the
ravines
i
came
upon
a
hollow
full
of
spring
water
which
overflowed
as
a
little
rivulet
where
sported
tiny
fish
battling
their
way
up
the
current
i
found
such
a
lovely
spring
i
told
my
father
could
we
get
our
bathing
and
drinking
water
from
there
the
very
thing
he
agreed
sharing
my
rapture
and
gave
orders
for
our
water
supply
to
be
drawn
from
that
spring
i
was
never
tired
of
roaming
about
among
those
miniature
hills
and
dales
in
hopes
of
lighting
on
something
never
known
before
i
was
the
livingstone
of
this
undiscovered
land
which
looked
as
if
seen
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
everything
there
the
dwarf
date
palms
the
scrubby
wild
plums
and
the
stunted
jambolans
was
in
keeping
with
the
miniature
mountain
ranges
the
little
rivulet
and
the
tiny
fish
i
had
discovered
illustration
singing
to
my
father
probably
in
order
to
teach
me
to
be
careful
my
father
placed
a
little
small
change
in
my
charge
and
required
me
to
keep
an
account
of
it
he
also
entrusted
me
with
the
duty
of
winding
his
valuable
gold
watch
for
him
he
overlooked
the
risk
of
damage
in
his
desire
to
train
me
to
a
sense
of
responsibility
when
we
went
out
together
for
our
morning
walk
he
would
ask
me
to
give
alms
to
any
beggars
we
came
across
but
i
never
could
render
him
a
proper
account
at
the
end
of
it
one
day
my
balance
was
larger
than
the
account
warranted
i
really
must
make
you
my
cashier
observed
my
father
money
seems
to
have
a
way
of
growing
in
your
hands
that
watch
of
his
i
wound
up
with
such
indefatigable
zeal
that
it
had
very
soon
to
be
sent
to
the
watchmaker
in
calcutta
i
am
reminded
of
the
time
when
later
in
life
i
was
appointed
to
manage
the
estate
and
had
to
lay
before
my
father
owing
to
his
failing
a
statement
of
accounts
on
the
second
or
third
of
every
month
i
had
first
to
read
out
the
totals
under
each
head
and
if
he
had
any
doubts
on
any
point
he
would
ask
for
the
details
if
i
made
any
attempt
to
slur
over
or
keep
out
of
sight
any
item
which
i
feared
he
would
not
like
it
was
sure
to
come
out
so
these
first
few
days
of
the
month
were
very
anxious
ones
for
me
as
i
have
said
my
father
had
the
habit
of
keeping
everything
clearly
before
his
mind
whether
figures
of
accounts
or
ceremonial
arrangements
or
additions
or
alterations
to
property
he
had
never
seen
the
new
prayer
hall
built
at
bolpur
and
yet
he
was
familiar
with
every
detail
of
it
from
questioning
those
who
came
to
see
him
after
a
visit
to
bolpur
he
had
an
extraordinary
memory
and
when
once
he
got
hold
of
a
fact
it
never
escaped
him
my
father
had
marked
his
favourite
verses
in
his
copy
of
the
he
asked
me
to
copy
these
out
with
their
translation
for
him
at
home
i
had
been
a
boy
of
no
account
but
here
when
these
important
functions
were
entrusted
to
me
i
felt
the
glory
of
the
situation
by
this
time
i
was
rid
of
my
blue
manuscript
book
and
had
got
hold
of
a
bound
volume
of
one
of
lett
diaries
i
now
saw
to
it
that
my
poetising
should
not
lack
any
of
the
dignity
of
outward
circumstance
it
was
not
only
a
case
of
writing
poems
but
of
holding
myself
forth
as
a
poet
before
my
own
imagination
so
when
i
wrote
poetry
at
bolpur
i
loved
to
do
it
sprawling
under
a
young
coconut
palm
this
seemed
to
me
the
true
poetic
way
resting
thus
on
the
hard
unturfed
gravel
in
the
burning
heat
of
the
day
i
composed
a
martial
ballad
on
the
defeat
of
king
prithwi
in
spite
of
the
superabundance
of
its
martial
spirit
it
could
not
escape
an
early
death
that
bound
volume
of
lett
diary
has
now
followed
the
way
of
its
elder
sister
the
blue
manuscript
book
leaving
no
address
behind
we
left
bolpur
and
making
short
halts
on
the
way
at
sahebganj
dinapore
allahabad
and
cawnpore
we
stopped
at
last
at
amritsar
an
incident
on
the
way
remains
engraved
on
my
memory
the
train
had
stopped
at
some
big
station
the
ticket
examiner
came
and
punched
our
tickets
he
looked
at
me
curiously
as
if
he
had
some
doubt
which
he
did
not
care
to
express
he
went
off
and
came
back
with
a
companion
both
of
them
fidgetted
about
for
a
time
near
the
door
of
our
compartment
and
then
again
retired
at
last
came
the
station
master
himself
he
looked
at
my
and
then
asked
is
not
the
boy
over
twelve
no
said
my
father
i
was
then
only
eleven
but
looked
older
than
my
age
you
must
pay
the
full
fare
for
him
said
the
station
master
my
father
eyes
flashed
as
without
a
word
he
took
out
a
currency
note
from
his
box
and
handed
it
to
the
station
master
when
they
brought
my
father
his
change
he
flung
it
disdainfully
back
at
them
while
the
station
master
stood
abashed
at
this
exposure
of
the
meanness
of
his
implied
doubt
the
golden
temple
of
amritsar
comes
back
to
me
like
a
dream
many
a
morning
have
i
accompanied
my
father
to
this
of
the
sikhs
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
there
the
sacred
chanting
resounds
continually
my
father
seated
amidst
the
throng
of
worshippers
would
sometimes
add
his
voice
to
the
hymn
of
praise
and
finding
a
stranger
joining
in
their
devotions
they
would
wax
enthusiastically
cordial
and
we
would
return
loaded
with
the
sanctified
offerings
of
sugar
crystals
and
other
sweets
one
day
my
father
invited
one
of
the
chanting
choir
to
our
place
and
got
him
to
sing
us
some
of
their
sacred
songs
the
man
went
away
probably
more
than
satisfied
with
the
reward
he
received
the
result
was
that
we
had
to
take
stern
measures
of
such
an
insistent
army
of
singers
invaded
us
when
they
found
our
house
impregnable
the
musicians
began
to
waylay
us
in
the
streets
and
as
we
went
out
for
our
walk
in
the
morning
every
now
and
then
would
appear
a
slung
over
a
shoulder
at
which
we
felt
like
game
birds
at
the
sight
of
the
muzzle
of
the
hunter
gun
indeed
so
wary
did
we
become
that
the
twang
of
the
from
a
distance
scared
us
away
and
utterly
failed
to
bag
us
when
evening
fell
my
father
would
sit
out
in
the
verandah
facing
the
garden
i
would
then
be
summoned
to
sing
to
him
the
moon
has
risen
its
beams
passing
though
the
trees
have
fallen
on
the
verandah
floor
i
am
singing
in
the
mode
o
companion
in
the
darkest
passage
of
life
my
father
with
bowed
head
and
clasped
hands
is
intently
listening
i
can
recall
this
evening
scene
even
now
i
have
told
of
my
father
amusement
on
hearing
from
srikantha
babu
of
my
maiden
attempt
at
a
devotional
poem
i
am
reminded
how
later
i
had
my
recompense
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
our
festivals
several
of
the
hymns
were
of
my
composition
one
of
them
was
the
eye
sees
thee
not
who
art
the
pupil
of
every
eye
my
father
was
then
at
chinsurah
he
sent
for
me
and
my
brother
jyoti
he
asked
my
brother
to
accompany
me
on
the
harmonium
and
got
me
to
sing
all
my
hymns
one
after
the
other
some
of
them
i
had
to
sing
twice
over
when
i
had
finished
he
said
if
the
king
of
the
country
had
known
the
language
and
could
appreciate
its
literature
he
would
doubtless
have
rewarded
the
poet
since
that
is
not
so
i
suppose
i
must
do
it
with
which
he
handed
me
a
cheque
my
father
had
brought
with
him
some
volumes
of
the
peter
parley
series
from
which
to
teach
me
he
selected
the
life
of
benjamin
franklin
to
begin
with
he
thought
it
would
read
like
a
story
book
and
be
both
entertaining
and
instructive
but
he
found
out
his
mistake
soon
after
we
began
it
benjamin
franklin
was
much
too
a
person
the
narrowness
of
his
calculated
morality
disgusted
my
father
in
some
cases
he
would
get
so
impatient
at
the
worldly
prudence
of
franklin
that
he
could
not
help
using
strong
words
of
denunciation
before
this
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
sanskrit
beyond
getting
some
rules
of
grammar
by
rote
my
father
started
me
on
the
second
sanskrit
reader
at
one
bound
leaving
me
to
learn
the
declensions
as
we
went
on
the
advance
i
had
made
in
bengali
stood
me
in
good
stead
my
father
also
encouraged
me
to
try
sanskrit
composition
from
the
very
outset
with
the
vocabulary
acquired
from
my
sanskrit
reader
i
built
up
grandiose
compound
words
with
a
profuse
sprinkling
of
sonorous
and
making
altogether
a
most
diabolical
medley
of
the
language
of
the
gods
but
my
father
never
scoffed
at
my
temerity
then
there
were
the
readings
from
proctor
popular
astronomy
which
my
father
explained
to
me
in
easy
language
and
which
i
then
rendered
into
bengali
among
the
books
which
my
father
had
brought
for
his
own
use
my
attention
would
be
mostly
attracted
by
a
ten
or
twelve
volume
edition
of
gibbon
rome
they
looked
remarkably
dry
being
a
boy
i
thought
i
am
helpless
and
read
many
books
because
i
have
to
but
why
should
a
grown
up
person
who
need
not
read
unless
he
pleases
bother
himself
so
the
we
stayed
about
a
month
in
amritsar
and
towards
the
middle
of
april
started
for
the
dalhousie
hills
the
last
few
days
at
amritsar
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
pass
the
call
of
the
himalayas
was
so
strong
upon
me
the
terraced
hill
sides
as
we
went
up
in
a
were
all
aflame
with
the
beauty
of
the
flowering
spring
crops
every
morning
we
would
make
a
start
after
our
bread
and
milk
and
before
sunset
take
shelter
for
the
night
in
the
next
staging
bungalow
my
eyes
had
no
rest
the
livelong
day
so
great
was
my
fear
lest
anything
should
escape
them
wherever
at
a
turn
of
the
road
into
a
gorge
the
great
forest
trees
were
found
clustering
closer
and
from
underneath
their
shade
a
little
waterfall
trickling
out
like
a
little
daughter
of
the
hermitage
playing
at
the
feet
of
hoary
sages
wrapt
in
meditation
babbling
its
way
over
the
black
rocks
there
the
bearers
would
put
down
their
burden
and
take
a
rest
why
oh
why
had
we
to
leave
such
spots
behind
cried
my
thirsting
heart
why
could
we
not
stay
on
there
for
ever
this
is
the
great
advantage
of
the
first
vision
the
mind
is
not
then
aware
that
there
are
many
more
such
to
come
when
this
comes
to
be
known
to
that
calculating
organ
it
promptly
tries
to
make
a
saving
in
its
expenditure
of
attention
it
is
only
when
it
believes
something
to
be
rare
that
the
mind
ceases
to
be
miserly
in
assigning
values
so
in
the
streets
of
calcutta
i
sometimes
imagine
myself
a
foreigner
and
only
then
do
i
discover
how
much
is
to
be
seen
which
is
lost
so
long
as
its
full
value
in
attention
is
not
paid
it
is
the
hunger
to
really
see
which
drives
people
to
travel
to
strange
places
my
father
left
his
little
in
my
charge
he
had
no
reason
to
imagine
that
i
was
the
fittest
custodian
of
the
considerable
sums
he
kept
in
it
for
use
on
the
way
he
would
certainly
have
felt
safer
with
it
in
the
hands
of
kishori
his
attendant
so
i
can
only
suppose
he
wanted
to
train
me
to
the
responsibility
one
day
as
we
reached
the
staging
bungalow
i
forgot
to
make
it
over
to
him
and
left
it
lying
on
a
table
this
earned
me
a
reprimand
every
time
we
got
down
at
the
end
of
a
stage
my
father
had
chairs
placed
for
us
outside
the
bungalow
and
there
we
sat
as
dusk
came
on
the
stars
blazed
out
wonderfully
through
the
clear
mountain
atmosphere
and
my
father
showed
me
the
constellations
or
treated
me
to
an
astronomical
discourse
the
house
we
had
taken
at
bakrota
was
on
the
highest
though
it
was
nearing
may
it
was
still
bitterly
cold
there
so
much
so
that
on
the
shady
side
of
the
hill
the
winter
frosts
had
not
yet
melted
my
father
was
not
at
all
nervous
about
allowing
me
to
wander
about
freely
even
here
some
way
below
our
house
there
stretched
a
spur
thickly
wooded
with
deodars
into
this
wilderness
i
would
venture
alone
with
my
staff
these
lordly
forest
trees
with
their
huge
shadows
towering
there
like
so
many
giants
what
immense
lives
had
they
lived
through
the
centuries
and
yet
this
boy
of
only
the
other
day
was
crawling
round
about
their
trunks
unchallenged
i
seemed
to
feel
a
presence
the
moment
i
stepped
into
their
shade
as
of
the
solid
coolness
of
some
saurian
and
the
checkered
light
and
shade
on
the
leafy
mould
seemed
like
its
scales
my
room
was
at
one
end
of
the
house
lying
on
my
bed
i
could
see
through
the
uncurtained
windows
the
distant
snowy
peaks
shimmering
dimly
in
the
starlight
sometimes
at
what
hour
i
could
not
make
out
i
half
awakened
would
see
my
father
wrapped
in
a
red
shawl
with
a
lighted
lamp
in
his
hand
softly
passing
by
to
the
glazed
verandah
where
he
sat
at
his
devotions
after
one
more
sleep
i
would
find
him
at
my
bedside
rousing
me
with
a
push
before
yet
the
darkness
of
night
had
passed
this
was
my
appointed
hour
for
memorising
sanscrit
declensions
what
an
excruciatingly
wintry
awakening
from
the
caressing
warmth
of
my
blankets
by
the
time
the
sun
rose
my
father
after
his
prayers
finished
with
me
our
morning
milk
and
then
i
standing
at
his
side
he
would
once
more
hold
communion
with
god
chanting
the
upanishads
then
we
would
go
out
for
a
walk
but
how
should
i
keep
pace
with
him
many
an
older
person
could
not
so
after
a
while
i
would
give
it
up
and
scramble
back
home
through
some
short
cut
up
the
mountain
side
after
my
father
return
i
had
an
hour
of
english
lessons
after
ten
came
the
bath
in
water
it
was
no
use
asking
the
servants
to
temper
it
with
even
a
jugful
of
hot
water
without
my
father
permission
to
give
me
courage
my
father
would
tell
of
the
unbearably
freezing
baths
he
had
himself
been
through
in
his
younger
days
another
penance
was
the
drinking
of
milk
my
father
was
very
fond
of
milk
and
could
take
quantities
of
it
but
whether
it
was
a
failure
to
inherit
this
capacity
or
that
the
unfavourable
environment
of
which
i
have
told
proved
the
stronger
my
appetite
for
milk
was
grievously
wanting
unfortunately
we
used
to
have
our
milk
together
so
i
had
to
throw
myself
on
the
mercy
of
the
servants
and
to
their
human
kindness
or
frailty
i
was
indebted
for
my
goblet
being
thenceforth
more
than
half
full
of
foam
after
our
midday
meal
lessons
began
again
but
this
was
more
than
flesh
and
blood
could
stand
my
outraged
morning
sleep
have
its
revenge
and
i
would
be
toppling
over
with
uncontrollable
drowsiness
nevertheless
no
sooner
did
my
father
take
pity
on
my
plight
and
let
me
off
than
my
sleepiness
was
off
likewise
then
ho
for
the
mountains
staff
in
hand
i
would
often
wander
away
from
one
peak
to
another
but
my
father
did
not
object
to
the
end
of
his
life
i
have
observed
he
never
stood
in
the
way
of
our
independence
many
a
time
have
i
said
or
done
things
repugnant
alike
to
his
taste
and
his
judgment
with
a
word
he
could
have
stopped
me
but
he
preferred
to
wait
till
the
prompting
to
refrain
came
from
within
a
passive
acceptance
by
us
of
the
correct
and
the
proper
did
not
satisfy
him
he
wanted
us
to
love
truth
with
our
whole
hearts
he
knew
that
mere
acquiescence
without
love
is
empty
he
also
knew
that
truth
if
strayed
from
can
be
found
again
but
a
forced
or
blind
acceptance
of
it
from
the
outside
effectually
bars
the
way
in
illustration
the
himalayas
in
my
early
youth
i
had
conceived
a
fancy
to
journey
along
the
grand
trunk
road
right
up
to
peshawar
in
a
bullock
cart
no
one
else
supported
the
scheme
and
doubtless
there
was
much
to
be
urged
against
it
as
a
practical
proposition
but
when
i
discoursed
on
it
to
my
father
he
was
sure
it
was
a
splendid
idea
travelling
by
railroad
was
not
worth
the
name
with
which
observation
he
proceeded
to
recount
to
me
his
own
adventurous
wanderings
on
foot
and
horseback
of
any
chance
of
discomfort
or
peril
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
another
time
when
i
had
just
been
appointed
secretary
of
the
adi
brahma
samaj
i
went
over
to
my
father
at
his
park
street
residence
and
informed
him
that
i
did
not
approve
of
the
practice
of
only
brahmins
conducting
divine
service
to
the
exclusion
of
other
castes
he
unhesitatingly
gave
me
permission
to
correct
this
if
i
could
when
i
got
the
authority
i
found
i
lacked
the
power
i
was
able
to
discover
imperfections
but
could
not
create
perfection
where
were
the
men
where
was
the
strength
in
me
to
attract
the
right
man
had
i
the
means
to
build
in
the
place
of
what
i
might
break
till
the
right
man
comes
any
form
is
better
than
none
this
i
felt
must
have
been
my
father
view
of
the
existing
order
but
he
did
not
for
a
moment
try
to
discourage
me
by
pointing
out
the
difficulties
as
he
allowed
me
to
wander
about
the
mountains
at
my
will
so
in
the
quest
for
truth
he
left
me
free
to
select
my
path
he
was
not
deterred
by
the
danger
of
my
making
mistakes
he
was
not
alarmed
at
the
prospect
of
my
encountering
sorrow
he
held
up
a
standard
not
a
disciplinary
rod
i
would
often
talk
to
my
father
of
home
whenever
i
got
a
letter
from
anyone
at
home
i
hastened
to
show
it
to
him
i
verily
believe
i
was
thus
the
means
of
giving
him
many
a
picture
he
could
have
got
from
none
else
my
father
also
let
me
read
letters
to
him
from
my
elder
brothers
this
was
his
way
of
teaching
me
how
i
ought
to
write
to
him
for
he
by
no
means
underrated
the
importance
of
outward
forms
and
ceremonial
i
am
reminded
of
how
in
one
of
my
second
brother
letters
he
was
complaining
in
somewhat
sanscritised
phraseology
of
being
worked
to
death
tied
by
the
neck
to
his
post
of
duty
my
father
asked
me
to
explain
the
sentiment
i
did
it
in
my
way
but
he
thought
a
different
explanation
would
fit
better
my
overweening
conceit
made
me
stick
to
my
guns
and
argue
the
point
with
him
at
length
another
would
have
shut
me
up
with
a
snub
but
my
father
patiently
heard
me
out
and
took
pains
to
justify
his
view
to
me
my
father
would
sometimes
tell
me
funny
stories
he
had
many
an
anecdote
of
the
gilded
youth
of
his
time
there
were
some
exquisites
for
whose
delicate
skins
the
embroidered
borders
of
even
dacca
muslins
were
too
coarse
so
that
to
wear
muslins
with
the
border
torn
off
became
for
a
time
the
thing
to
do
i
was
also
highly
amused
to
hear
from
my
father
for
the
first
time
the
story
of
the
milkman
who
was
suspected
of
watering
his
milk
and
the
more
men
one
of
his
customers
detailed
to
look
after
his
milking
the
bluer
the
fluid
became
till
at
last
when
the
customer
himself
interviewed
him
and
asked
for
an
explanation
the
milkman
avowed
that
if
more
superintendents
had
to
be
satisfied
it
would
only
make
the
milk
fit
to
breed
fish
after
i
had
thus
spent
a
few
months
with
him
my
father
sent
me
back
home
with
his
attendant
kishori
part
iv
my
return
the
chains
of
the
rigorous
regime
which
had
bound
me
snapped
for
good
when
i
set
out
from
home
on
my
return
i
gained
an
accession
of
rights
in
my
case
my
very
nearness
had
so
long
kept
me
out
of
mind
now
that
i
had
been
out
of
sight
i
came
back
into
view
i
got
a
foretaste
of
appreciation
while
still
on
the
return
journey
travelling
alone
as
i
was
with
an
attendant
brimming
with
health
and
spirits
and
conspicuous
with
my
cap
all
the
english
people
i
came
across
in
the
train
made
much
of
me
when
i
arrived
it
was
not
merely
a
from
travel
it
was
also
a
return
from
my
exile
in
the
servants
quarters
to
my
proper
place
in
the
inner
apartments
whenever
the
inner
household
assembled
in
my
mother
room
i
now
occupied
a
seat
of
honour
and
she
who
was
then
the
youngest
bride
of
our
house
lavished
on
me
a
wealth
of
affection
and
regard
in
infancy
the
loving
care
of
woman
is
to
be
had
without
the
asking
and
being
as
much
a
necessity
as
light
and
air
is
as
simply
accepted
without
any
conscious
response
rather
does
the
growing
child
often
display
an
eagerness
to
free
itself
from
the
encircling
web
of
solicitude
but
the
unfortunate
creature
who
is
deprived
of
this
in
its
proper
season
is
beggared
indeed
this
had
been
my
plight
so
after
being
brought
up
in
the
servants
quarters
when
i
suddenly
came
in
for
a
profusion
of
womanly
affection
i
could
hardly
remain
unconscious
of
it
in
the
days
when
the
inner
apartments
were
as
yet
far
away
from
me
they
were
the
elysium
of
my
imagination
the
zenana
which
from
an
outside
view
is
a
place
of
confinement
for
me
was
the
abode
of
all
freedom
neither
school
nor
pandit
were
there
nor
it
seemed
to
me
did
anybody
have
to
do
what
they
did
not
want
to
its
secluded
leisure
had
something
mysterious
about
it
one
played
about
or
did
as
one
liked
and
had
not
to
render
an
account
of
one
doings
specially
so
with
my
youngest
sister
to
whom
though
she
attended
nilkamal
pandit
class
with
us
it
seemed
to
make
no
difference
in
his
behaviour
whether
she
did
her
lessons
well
or
then
again
while
by
ten
we
had
to
hurry
through
our
breakfast
and
be
ready
for
school
she
with
her
queue
dangling
behind
walked
unconcernedly
away
withinwards
tantalising
us
to
distraction
and
when
the
new
bride
adorned
with
her
necklace
of
gold
came
into
our
house
the
mystery
of
the
inner
apartments
deepened
she
who
came
from
outside
and
yet
became
one
of
us
who
was
unknown
and
yet
our
own
attracted
me
strangely
with
her
i
burned
to
make
friends
but
if
by
much
contriving
i
managed
to
draw
near
my
youngest
sister
would
hustle
me
off
with
what
boys
want
here
get
away
outside
the
insult
added
to
the
disappointment
cut
me
to
the
quick
through
the
glass
doors
of
their
cabinets
one
could
catch
glimpses
of
all
manner
of
curious
playthings
creations
of
porcelain
and
glass
gorgeous
in
colouring
and
ornamentation
we
were
not
deemed
worthy
even
to
touch
them
much
less
could
we
muster
up
courage
to
ask
for
any
to
play
with
nevertheless
these
rare
and
wonderful
objects
as
they
were
to
us
boys
served
to
tinge
with
an
additional
attraction
the
lure
of
the
inner
apartments
thus
had
i
been
kept
at
arm
length
with
repeated
rebuffs
as
the
outer
world
so
for
me
the
interior
was
unattainable
wherefore
the
impressions
of
it
that
i
did
get
appeared
to
me
like
pictures
after
nine
in
the
evening
my
lessons
with
aghore
babu
over
i
am
retiring
within
for
the
night
a
murky
flickering
lantern
is
hanging
in
the
long
corridor
leading
from
the
outer
to
the
inner
apartments
at
its
end
this
passage
turns
into
a
flight
of
four
or
five
steps
to
which
the
light
does
not
reach
and
down
which
i
pass
into
the
galleries
running
round
the
first
inner
quadrangle
a
shaft
of
moonlight
slants
from
the
eastern
sky
into
the
western
angle
of
these
verandahs
leaving
the
rest
in
darkness
in
this
patch
of
light
the
maids
have
gathered
and
are
squatting
close
together
with
legs
outstretched
rolling
cotton
waste
into
and
chatting
in
undertones
of
their
village
homes
many
such
pictures
are
indelibly
printed
on
my
memory
then
after
our
supper
the
washing
of
our
hands
and
feet
on
the
verandah
before
stretching
ourselves
on
the
ample
expanse
of
our
bed
whereupon
one
of
the
nurses
tinkari
or
sankari
comes
and
sits
by
our
heads
and
softly
croons
to
us
the
story
of
the
prince
travelling
on
and
on
over
the
lonely
moor
and
as
it
comes
to
an
end
silence
falls
on
the
room
with
my
face
to
the
wall
i
gaze
at
the
black
and
white
patches
made
by
the
plaster
of
the
walls
fallen
off
here
and
there
showing
faintly
in
the
dim
light
and
out
of
these
i
conjure
up
many
a
fantastic
image
as
i
drop
off
to
sleep
and
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
hear
through
my
sleep
the
shouts
of
old
swarup
the
watchman
going
his
rounds
from
verandah
to
verandah
then
came
the
new
order
when
i
got
in
profusion
from
this
inner
unknown
dreamland
of
my
fancies
the
recognition
for
which
i
had
all
along
been
pining
when
that
which
naturally
should
have
come
day
by
day
was
suddenly
made
good
to
me
with
accumulated
arrears
i
can
not
say
that
my
head
was
not
turned
the
little
traveller
was
full
of
the
story
of
his
travels
and
with
the
strain
of
each
repetition
the
narrative
got
looser
and
looser
till
it
utterly
refused
to
fit
into
the
facts
like
everything
else
alas
a
story
also
gets
stale
and
the
glory
of
the
teller
suffers
likewise
that
is
why
he
has
to
add
fresh
colouring
every
time
to
keep
up
its
freshness
after
my
return
from
the
hills
i
was
the
principal
speaker
at
my
mother
open
air
gatherings
on
the
roof
terrace
in
the
evenings
the
temptation
to
become
famous
in
the
eyes
of
one
mother
is
as
difficult
to
resist
as
such
fame
is
easy
to
earn
while
i
was
at
the
normal
school
when
i
first
came
across
the
information
in
some
reader
that
the
sun
was
hundreds
and
thousands
of
times
as
big
as
the
earth
i
at
once
disclosed
it
to
my
mother
it
served
to
prove
that
he
who
was
small
to
look
at
might
yet
have
a
considerable
amount
of
bigness
about
him
i
used
also
to
recite
to
her
the
scraps
of
poetry
used
as
illustrations
in
the
chapter
on
prosody
or
rhetoric
of
our
bengali
grammar
now
i
retailed
at
her
evening
gatherings
the
astronomical
i
had
gleaned
from
proctor
my
father
follower
kishori
belonged
at
one
time
to
a
band
of
reciters
of
dasarathi
jingling
versions
of
the
epics
while
we
were
together
in
the
hills
he
often
said
to
me
oh
my
little
brother
if
i
only
had
had
you
in
our
troupe
we
could
have
got
up
a
splendid
performance
this
would
open
up
to
me
a
tempting
picture
of
wandering
as
a
minstrel
boy
from
place
to
place
reciting
and
singing
i
learnt
from
him
many
of
the
songs
in
his
repertoire
and
these
were
in
even
greater
request
than
my
talks
about
the
photosphere
of
the
sun
or
the
many
moons
of
saturn
but
the
achievement
of
mine
which
appealed
most
to
my
mother
was
that
while
the
rest
of
the
inmates
of
the
inner
apartments
had
to
be
content
with
krittivasa
bengali
rendering
of
the
ramayana
i
had
been
reading
with
my
father
the
original
of
maharshi
valmiki
himself
sanscrit
metre
and
all
read
me
some
of
that
ramayana
she
said
overjoyed
at
this
news
which
i
had
given
her
illustration
the
in
the
verandah
alas
my
reading
of
valmiki
had
been
limited
to
the
short
extract
from
his
ramayana
given
in
my
sanskrit
reader
and
even
that
i
had
not
fully
mastered
moreover
on
looking
over
it
now
i
found
that
my
memory
had
played
me
false
and
much
of
what
i
thought
i
knew
had
become
hazy
but
i
lacked
the
courage
to
plead
i
have
forgotten
to
the
eager
mother
awaiting
the
display
of
her
son
marvellous
talents
so
that
in
the
reading
i
gave
a
large
divergence
occurred
between
intention
and
my
explanation
that
sage
from
his
seat
in
heaven
must
have
forgiven
the
temerity
of
the
boy
seeking
the
glory
of
his
mother
approbation
but
not
so
madhusudan
the
taker
down
of
pride
my
mother
unable
to
contain
her
feelings
at
my
extraordinary
exploit
wanted
all
to
share
her
admiration
you
must
read
this
to
dwijendra
my
eldest
brother
she
said
in
for
it
thought
i
as
i
put
forth
all
the
excuses
i
could
think
of
but
my
mother
would
have
none
of
them
she
sent
for
my
brother
dwijendra
and
as
soon
as
he
arrived
greeted
him
with
just
hear
rabi
read
valmiki
ramayan
how
splendidly
he
does
it
it
had
to
be
done
but
madhusudan
relented
and
let
me
off
with
just
a
taste
of
his
power
my
brother
must
have
been
called
away
while
busy
with
some
literary
work
of
his
own
he
showed
no
anxiety
to
hear
me
render
the
sanscrit
into
bengali
and
as
soon
as
i
had
read
out
a
few
verses
he
simply
remarked
very
good
and
walked
away
after
my
promotion
to
the
inner
apartments
i
felt
it
all
the
more
difficult
to
resume
my
school
life
i
resorted
to
all
manner
of
subterfuges
to
escape
the
bengal
academy
then
they
tried
putting
me
at
xavier
but
the
result
was
no
better
my
elder
brothers
after
a
few
spasmodic
efforts
gave
up
all
hopes
of
me
they
even
ceased
to
scold
me
one
day
my
eldest
sister
said
we
had
all
hoped
rabi
would
grow
up
to
be
a
man
but
he
has
disappointed
us
the
worst
i
felt
that
my
value
in
the
social
world
was
distinctly
depreciating
nevertheless
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
be
tied
to
the
eternal
grind
of
the
school
mill
which
divorced
as
it
was
from
all
life
and
beauty
seemed
such
a
hideously
cruel
combination
of
hospital
and
gaol
one
precious
memory
of
xavier
i
still
hold
fresh
and
pure
the
memory
of
its
teachers
not
that
they
were
all
of
the
same
excellence
in
particular
in
those
who
taught
in
our
class
i
could
discern
no
reverential
resignation
of
spirit
they
were
in
nowise
above
the
variety
of
school
masters
as
it
is
the
educational
engine
is
remorselessly
powerful
when
to
it
is
coupled
the
stone
mill
of
the
outward
forms
of
religion
the
heart
of
youth
is
crushed
dry
indeed
this
grindstone
type
we
had
at
xavier
yet
as
i
say
i
possess
a
memory
which
elevates
my
impression
of
the
teachers
there
to
an
ideal
plane
this
is
the
memory
of
father
depeneranda
he
had
very
little
to
do
with
us
if
i
remember
right
he
had
only
for
a
while
taken
the
place
of
one
of
the
masters
of
our
class
he
was
a
spaniard
and
seemed
to
have
an
impediment
in
speaking
english
it
was
perhaps
for
this
reason
that
the
boys
paid
but
little
heed
to
what
he
was
saying
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
inattentiveness
of
his
pupils
hurt
him
but
he
bore
it
meekly
day
after
day
i
know
not
why
but
my
heart
went
out
to
him
in
sympathy
his
features
were
not
handsome
but
his
countenance
had
for
me
a
strange
attraction
whenever
i
looked
on
him
his
spirit
seemed
to
be
in
prayer
a
deep
peace
to
pervade
him
within
and
without
we
had
for
writing
our
copybooks
that
was
a
time
when
pen
in
hand
i
used
to
become
and
my
thoughts
wandered
hither
and
thither
one
day
father
depeneranda
was
in
charge
of
this
class
he
was
pacing
up
and
down
behind
our
benches
he
must
have
noticed
more
than
once
that
my
pen
was
not
moving
all
of
a
sudden
he
stopped
behind
my
seat
bending
over
me
he
gently
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
tenderly
inquired
are
you
not
well
tagore
it
was
only
a
simple
question
but
one
i
have
never
been
able
to
forget
i
can
not
speak
for
the
other
boys
but
i
felt
in
him
the
presence
of
a
great
soul
and
even
the
recollection
of
it
seems
to
give
me
a
passport
into
the
silent
seclusion
of
the
temple
of
god
there
was
another
old
father
whom
all
the
boys
loved
this
was
father
henry
he
taught
in
the
higher
classes
so
i
did
not
know
him
well
but
one
thing
about
him
i
remember
he
knew
bengali
he
once
asked
nirada
a
boy
in
his
class
the
derivation
of
his
name
poor
nirada
had
so
long
been
supremely
easy
in
mind
about
himself
the
derivation
of
his
name
in
particular
had
never
troubled
him
in
the
least
so
that
he
was
utterly
unprepared
to
answer
this
question
and
yet
with
so
many
abstruse
and
unknown
words
in
the
dictionary
to
be
worsted
by
one
own
name
would
have
been
as
ridiculous
a
mishap
as
getting
run
over
by
own
carriage
so
nirada
unblushingly
replied
privative
thence
nirode
that
which
causes
an
absence
of
the
sun
rays
gyan
babu
son
of
pandit
vedantavagish
was
now
our
tutor
at
home
when
he
found
he
could
not
secure
my
attention
for
the
school
course
he
gave
up
the
attempt
as
hopeless
and
went
on
a
different
tack
he
took
me
through
kalidas
birth
of
the
translating
it
to
me
as
we
went
on
he
also
read
macbeth
to
me
first
explaining
the
text
in
bengali
and
then
confining
me
to
the
school
room
till
i
had
rendered
the
day
reading
into
bengali
verse
in
this
way
he
got
me
to
translate
the
whole
play
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
lose
this
translation
and
so
am
relieved
to
that
extent
of
the
burden
of
my
it
was
pandit
ramsarvaswa
duty
to
see
to
the
progress
of
our
sanskrit
he
likewise
gave
up
the
fruitless
task
of
teaching
grammar
to
his
unwilling
pupil
and
read
sakuntala
with
me
instead
one
day
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
show
my
translation
of
macbeth
to
pandit
vidyasagar
and
took
me
over
to
his
house
rajkrishna
mukherji
had
called
at
the
time
and
was
seated
with
him
my
heart
went
as
i
entered
the
great
pandit
study
packed
full
of
books
nor
did
his
austere
visage
assist
in
reviving
my
courage
nevertheless
as
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
had
such
a
distinguished
audience
my
desire
to
win
renown
was
strong
within
me
i
returned
home
i
believe
with
some
reason
for
an
access
of
enthusiasm
as
for
rajkrishna
babu
he
contented
himself
with
admonishing
me
to
be
careful
to
keep
the
language
and
metre
of
the
witches
parts
different
from
that
of
the
human
characters
during
my
boyhood
bengali
literature
was
meagre
in
body
and
i
think
i
must
have
finished
all
the
readable
and
unreadable
books
that
there
were
at
the
time
juvenile
literature
in
those
days
had
not
evolved
a
distinct
type
of
its
own
but
that
i
am
sure
did
me
no
harm
the
watery
stuff
into
which
literary
nectar
is
now
diluted
for
being
served
up
to
the
young
takes
full
account
of
their
childishness
but
none
of
them
as
growing
human
beings
children
books
should
be
such
as
can
partly
be
understood
by
them
and
partly
not
in
our
childhood
we
read
every
available
book
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
both
what
we
understood
and
what
we
did
not
went
on
working
within
us
that
is
how
the
world
itself
reacts
on
the
child
consciousness
the
child
makes
its
own
what
it
understands
while
that
which
is
beyond
leads
it
on
a
step
forward
when
dinabandhu
mitra
satires
came
out
i
was
not
of
an
age
for
which
they
were
suitable
a
kinswoman
of
ours
was
reading
a
copy
but
no
entreaties
of
mine
could
induce
her
to
lend
it
to
me
she
used
to
keep
it
under
lock
and
key
its
inaccessibility
made
me
want
it
all
the
more
and
i
threw
out
the
challenge
that
read
the
book
i
must
and
would
one
afternoon
she
was
playing
cards
and
her
keys
tied
to
a
corner
of
her
hung
over
her
shoulder
i
had
never
paid
any
attention
to
cards
in
fact
i
could
not
stand
card
games
but
my
behaviour
that
day
would
hardly
have
borne
this
out
so
engrossed
was
i
in
their
playing
at
last
in
the
excitement
of
one
side
being
about
to
make
a
score
i
seized
my
opportunity
and
set
about
untying
the
knot
which
held
the
keys
i
was
not
skilful
and
moreover
excited
and
hasty
and
so
got
caught
the
owner
of
the
and
of
the
keys
took
the
fold
off
her
shoulder
with
a
smile
and
laid
the
keys
on
her
lap
as
she
went
on
with
the
game
then
i
hit
on
a
stratagem
my
kinswoman
was
fond
of
and
i
hastened
to
place
some
before
her
this
entailed
her
rising
later
on
to
get
rid
of
the
chewed
and
as
she
did
so
her
keys
fell
off
her
lap
and
were
replaced
over
her
shoulder
this
time
they
got
stolen
the
culprit
got
off
and
the
book
got
read
its
owner
tried
to
scold
me
but
the
attempt
was
not
a
success
we
both
laughed
so
rajendralal
mitra
used
to
edit
an
illustrated
monthly
miscellany
my
third
brother
had
a
bound
annual
volume
of
it
in
his
bookcase
this
i
managed
to
secure
and
the
delight
of
reading
it
through
over
and
over
again
still
comes
back
to
me
many
a
holiday
noontide
has
passed
with
me
stretched
on
my
back
on
my
bed
that
square
volume
on
my
breast
reading
about
the
narwhal
whale
or
the
curiosities
of
justice
as
administered
by
the
kazis
of
old
or
the
romantic
story
of
why
do
we
not
have
such
magazines
we
have
philosophical
and
scientific
articles
on
the
one
hand
and
insipid
stories
and
travels
on
the
other
but
no
such
unpretentious
miscellanies
which
the
ordinary
person
can
read
in
comfort
such
as
chambers
or
cassell
or
the
strand
in
england
which
supply
the
general
reader
with
a
simple
but
satisfying
fare
and
are
of
the
greatest
use
to
the
greatest
number
i
came
across
another
little
periodical
in
my
young
days
called
the
ignorant
man
friend
i
found
a
collection
of
its
monthly
numbers
in
my
eldest
brother
library
and
devoured
them
day
after
day
seated
on
the
doorsill
of
his
study
facing
a
bit
of
terrace
to
the
south
it
was
in
the
pages
of
this
magazine
that
i
made
my
first
acquaintance
with
the
poetry
of
viharilal
chakravarti
his
poems
appealed
to
me
the
most
of
all
that
i
read
at
the
time
the
artless
of
his
lyrics
awoke
within
me
the
music
of
fields
and
into
these
same
pages
i
have
wept
many
a
tear
over
a
pathetic
translation
of
paul
and
virginie
that
wonderful
sea
the
cocoanut
forests
on
its
shore
and
the
slopes
beyond
lively
with
the
gambols
of
mountain
goats
a
delightfully
refreshing
mirage
they
conjured
up
on
that
terraced
roof
in
calcutta
and
oh
the
romantic
courting
that
went
on
in
the
forest
paths
of
that
secluded
island
between
the
bengali
boy
reader
and
little
virginie
with
the
kerchief
round
her
head
then
came
bankim
taking
the
bengali
heart
by
storm
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
to
wait
till
the
next
monthly
number
was
out
but
to
be
kept
waiting
further
till
my
elders
had
done
with
it
was
simply
intolerable
now
he
who
will
may
swallow
at
a
mouthful
the
whole
of
or
but
the
process
of
longing
and
anticipating
month
after
month
of
spreading
over
the
long
intervals
the
concentrated
joy
of
each
short
reading
revolving
every
instalment
over
and
over
in
the
mind
while
watching
and
waiting
for
the
next
the
combination
of
satisfaction
with
unsatisfied
craving
of
burning
curiosity
with
its
appeasement
these
long
drawn
out
delights
of
going
through
the
original
serial
none
will
ever
taste
again
the
compilations
from
the
old
poets
by
sarada
mitter
and
akshay
sarkar
were
also
of
great
interest
to
me
our
elders
were
subscribers
but
not
very
regular
readers
of
these
series
so
that
it
was
not
difficult
for
me
to
get
at
them
vidyapati
quaint
and
corrupt
maithili
language
attracted
me
all
the
more
because
of
its
unintelligibility
i
tried
to
make
out
his
sense
without
the
help
of
the
compiler
notes
jotting
down
in
my
own
note
book
all
the
more
obscure
words
with
their
context
as
many
times
as
they
occurred
i
also
noted
grammatical
peculiarities
according
to
my
lights
home
one
great
advantage
which
i
enjoyed
in
my
younger
days
was
the
literary
and
artistic
atmosphere
which
pervaded
our
house
i
remember
how
when
i
was
quite
a
child
i
would
be
leaning
against
the
verandah
railings
which
overlooked
the
detached
building
comprising
the
reception
rooms
these
rooms
would
be
lighted
up
every
evening
splendid
carriages
would
draw
up
under
the
portico
and
visitors
would
be
constantly
coming
and
going
what
was
happening
i
could
not
very
well
make
out
but
would
keep
staring
at
the
rows
of
lighted
casements
from
my
place
in
the
darkness
the
intervening
space
was
not
great
but
the
gulf
between
my
infant
world
and
these
lights
was
immense
my
elder
cousin
ganendra
had
just
got
a
drama
written
by
pandit
tarkaratna
and
was
having
it
staged
in
the
house
his
enthusiasm
for
literature
and
the
fine
arts
knew
no
bounds
he
was
the
centre
of
the
group
who
seem
to
have
been
almost
consciously
striving
to
bring
about
from
every
side
the
renascence
which
we
see
a
pronounced
nationalism
in
dress
literature
music
art
and
the
drama
had
awakened
in
and
around
him
he
was
a
keen
student
of
the
history
of
different
countries
and
had
begun
but
could
not
complete
a
historical
work
in
bengali
he
had
translated
and
published
the
sanskrit
drama
vikramorvasi
and
many
a
hymn
is
his
composition
he
may
be
said
to
have
given
us
the
lead
in
writing
patriotic
poems
and
songs
this
was
in
the
days
when
the
hindu
mela
was
an
annual
institution
and
there
his
song
ashamed
am
i
to
sing
of
india
glories
used
to
be
sung
i
was
still
a
child
when
my
cousin
ganendra
died
in
the
prime
of
his
youth
but
for
those
who
have
once
beheld
him
it
is
impossible
to
forget
his
handsome
tall
and
stately
figure
he
had
an
irresistible
social
influence
he
could
draw
men
round
him
and
keep
them
bound
to
him
while
his
powerful
attraction
was
there
disruption
was
out
of
the
question
he
was
one
of
those
a
type
peculiar
to
our
country
who
by
their
personal
magnetism
easily
establish
themselves
in
the
centre
of
their
family
or
village
in
any
other
country
where
large
political
social
or
commercial
groups
are
being
formed
such
would
as
naturally
become
national
leaders
the
power
of
organising
a
large
number
of
men
into
a
corporate
group
depends
on
a
special
kind
of
genius
such
genius
in
our
country
runs
to
waste
a
waste
as
pitiful
it
seems
to
me
as
that
of
pulling
down
a
star
from
the
firmament
for
use
as
a
lucifer
match
i
remember
still
better
his
younger
brother
my
cousin
gunendra
he
likewise
kept
the
house
filled
with
his
personality
his
large
gracious
heart
embraced
alike
relatives
friends
guests
and
dependants
whether
in
his
broad
south
verandah
or
on
the
lawn
by
the
fountain
or
at
the
on
the
fishing
platform
he
presided
over
gatherings
like
hospitality
incarnate
his
wide
appreciation
of
art
and
talent
kept
him
constantly
radiant
with
enthusiasm
new
ideas
of
festivity
or
frolic
theatricals
or
other
entertainments
found
in
him
a
ready
patron
and
with
his
help
would
flourish
and
find
fruition
we
were
too
young
then
to
take
any
part
in
these
doings
but
the
waves
of
merriment
and
life
to
which
they
gave
rise
came
and
beat
at
the
doors
of
our
curiosity
i
remember
how
a
burlesque
composed
by
my
eldest
brother
was
once
being
rehearsed
in
my
cousin
big
drawing
room
from
our
place
against
the
verandah
railings
of
our
house
we
could
hear
through
the
open
windows
opposite
roars
of
laughter
mixed
with
the
strains
of
a
comic
song
and
would
also
occasionally
catch
glimpses
of
akshay
mazumdar
extraordinary
antics
we
could
not
gather
exactly
what
the
song
was
about
but
lived
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
find
that
out
sometime
i
recall
how
a
trifling
circumstance
earned
for
me
the
special
regard
of
cousin
gunendra
never
had
i
got
a
prize
at
school
except
once
for
good
conduct
of
the
three
of
us
my
nephew
satya
was
the
best
at
his
lessons
he
once
did
well
at
some
examination
and
was
awarded
a
prize
as
we
came
home
i
jumped
off
the
carriage
to
give
the
great
news
to
my
cousin
who
was
in
the
garden
satya
has
got
a
prize
i
shouted
as
i
ran
to
him
he
drew
me
to
his
knees
with
a
smile
and
have
not
got
a
prize
he
asked
no
said
i
not
i
it
satya
my
genuine
pleasure
at
satya
success
seemed
to
touch
my
cousin
particularly
he
turned
to
his
friends
and
remarked
on
it
as
a
very
creditable
trait
i
well
remember
how
mystified
i
felt
at
this
for
i
had
not
thought
of
my
feeling
in
that
light
this
prize
that
i
got
for
not
getting
a
prize
did
not
do
me
good
there
is
no
harm
in
making
gifts
to
children
but
they
should
not
be
rewards
it
is
not
healthy
for
youngsters
to
be
made
after
the
meal
cousin
gunendra
would
attend
the
estate
offices
in
our
part
of
the
house
the
office
room
of
our
elders
was
a
sort
of
club
where
laughter
and
conversation
were
freely
mixed
with
matters
of
business
my
cousin
would
recline
on
a
couch
and
i
would
seize
some
opportunity
of
edging
up
to
him
illustration
my
eldest
brother
he
usually
told
me
stories
from
indian
history
i
still
remember
the
surprise
with
which
i
heard
how
clive
after
establishing
british
rule
in
india
went
back
home
and
cut
his
own
throat
on
the
one
hand
new
history
being
made
on
the
other
a
tragic
chapter
hidden
away
in
the
mysterious
darkness
of
a
human
heart
how
could
there
be
such
dismal
failure
within
and
such
brilliant
success
outside
this
weighed
heavily
on
my
mind
the
whole
day
some
days
cousin
gunendra
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
in
any
doubt
as
to
the
contents
of
my
pocket
at
the
least
encouragement
out
would
come
my
manuscript
book
unabashed
i
need
hardly
state
that
my
cousin
was
not
a
severe
critic
in
point
of
fact
the
opinions
he
expressed
would
have
done
splendidly
as
advertisements
none
the
less
when
in
any
of
my
poetry
my
childishness
became
too
obtrusive
he
could
not
restrain
his
hearty
ha
ha
one
day
it
was
a
poem
on
mother
india
and
as
at
the
end
of
one
line
the
only
rhyme
i
could
think
of
meant
a
cart
i
had
to
drag
in
that
cart
in
spite
of
there
not
being
the
vestige
of
a
road
by
which
it
could
reasonably
arrive
the
insistent
claims
of
rhyme
would
not
hear
of
any
excuses
mere
reason
had
to
offer
the
storm
of
laughter
with
which
cousin
gunendra
greeted
it
blew
away
the
cart
back
over
the
same
impossible
path
it
had
come
by
and
it
has
not
been
heard
of
since
my
eldest
brother
was
then
busy
with
his
masterpiece
the
dream
journey
his
cushion
seat
placed
in
the
south
verandah
a
low
desk
before
him
cousin
gunendra
would
come
and
sit
there
for
a
time
every
morning
his
immense
capacity
for
enjoyment
like
the
breezes
of
spring
helped
poetry
to
sprout
my
eldest
brother
would
go
on
alternately
writing
and
reading
out
what
he
had
written
his
boisterous
mirth
at
his
own
conceits
making
the
verandah
tremble
my
brother
wrote
a
great
deal
more
than
he
finally
used
in
his
finished
work
so
fertile
was
his
poetic
inspiration
like
the
superabounding
mango
flowerets
which
carpet
the
shade
of
the
mango
topes
in
spring
time
the
rejected
pages
of
his
dream
journey
were
to
be
found
scattered
all
over
the
house
had
anyone
preserved
them
they
would
have
been
a
basketful
of
flowers
adorning
our
bengali
literature
eavesdropping
at
doors
and
peeping
round
corners
we
used
to
get
our
full
share
of
this
feast
of
poetry
so
plentiful
was
it
with
so
much
to
spare
my
eldest
brother
was
then
at
the
height
of
his
wonderful
powers
and
from
his
pen
surged
in
untiring
wave
after
wave
a
tidal
flood
of
poetic
fancy
rhyme
and
expression
filling
and
overflowing
its
banks
with
an
exuberantly
joyful
pæan
of
triumph
did
we
quite
understand
the
dream
journey
but
then
did
we
need
absolutely
to
understand
in
order
to
enjoy
it
we
might
not
have
got
at
the
wealth
in
the
ocean
depths
what
could
we
have
done
with
it
if
we
had
but
we
revelled
in
the
delights
of
the
waves
on
the
shore
and
how
gaily
at
their
buffettings
did
our
course
through
every
vein
and
artery
the
more
i
think
of
that
period
the
more
i
realise
that
we
have
no
longer
the
thing
called
a
in
our
boyhood
we
beheld
the
dying
rays
of
that
intimate
sociability
which
was
characteristic
of
the
last
generation
neighbourly
feelings
were
then
so
strong
that
the
was
a
necessity
and
those
who
could
contribute
to
its
amenities
were
in
great
request
people
call
on
each
other
on
business
or
as
a
matter
of
social
duty
but
not
to
foregather
by
way
of
they
have
not
the
time
nor
are
there
the
same
intimate
relations
what
goings
and
comings
we
used
to
see
how
merry
were
the
rooms
and
verandahs
with
the
hum
of
conversation
and
the
snatches
of
laughter
the
faculty
our
predecessors
had
of
becoming
the
centre
of
groups
and
gatherings
of
starting
and
keeping
up
animated
and
amusing
gossip
has
vanished
men
still
come
and
go
but
those
same
verandahs
and
rooms
seem
empty
and
deserted
in
those
days
everything
from
furniture
to
festivity
was
designed
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
many
so
that
whatever
of
pomp
or
magnificence
there
might
have
been
did
not
savour
of
hauteur
these
appendages
have
since
increased
in
quantity
but
they
have
become
unfeeling
and
know
not
the
art
of
making
high
and
low
alike
feel
at
home
the
the
indigently
clad
no
longer
have
the
right
to
use
and
occupy
them
without
a
permit
on
the
strength
of
their
smiling
faces
alone
those
whom
we
seek
to
imitate
in
our
and
furnishing
they
have
their
own
society
with
its
wide
hospitality
the
mischief
with
us
is
that
we
have
lost
what
we
had
but
have
not
the
means
of
building
up
afresh
on
the
european
standard
with
the
result
that
our
has
become
joyless
we
still
meet
for
business
or
political
purposes
but
never
for
the
pleasure
of
simply
meeting
one
another
we
have
ceased
to
contrive
opportunities
to
bring
men
together
simply
because
we
love
our
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
ugly
than
this
social
miserliness
and
when
i
look
back
on
those
whose
ringing
laughter
coming
straight
from
their
hearts
used
to
lighten
for
us
the
burden
of
household
cares
they
seem
to
have
been
visitors
from
some
other
world
there
came
to
me
in
my
boyhood
a
friend
whose
help
in
my
literary
progress
was
invaluable
akshay
chowdhury
was
a
of
my
fourth
brother
he
was
an
in
english
literature
for
which
his
love
was
as
great
as
his
proficiency
therein
on
the
other
hand
he
had
an
equal
fondness
for
our
older
bengali
authors
and
vaishnava
poets
he
knew
hundreds
of
bengali
songs
of
unknown
authorship
and
on
these
he
would
launch
with
voice
uplifted
regardless
of
tune
or
consequence
or
of
the
express
disapproval
of
his
hearers
nor
could
anything
within
him
or
without
prevent
his
loudly
beating
time
to
his
own
music
for
which
the
nearest
table
or
book
served
his
nimble
fingers
to
rap
a
vigorous
tattoo
on
to
help
to
enliven
the
audience
he
was
also
one
of
those
with
an
inordinate
capacity
for
extracting
enjoyment
from
all
and
sundry
he
was
as
ready
to
absorb
every
bit
of
goodness
in
a
thing
as
he
was
lavish
in
singing
its
praises
he
had
an
extraordinary
gift
as
a
lightning
composer
of
lyrics
and
songs
of
no
mean
merit
but
in
which
he
himself
had
no
pride
of
authorship
he
took
no
further
notice
of
the
heaps
of
scattered
scraps
of
paper
on
which
his
pencil
writings
had
been
indited
he
was
as
indifferent
to
his
powers
as
they
were
prolific
one
of
his
longer
poetic
pieces
was
much
appreciated
when
it
appeared
in
the
and
i
have
heard
his
songs
sung
by
many
who
knew
nothing
at
all
about
their
composer
a
genuine
delight
in
literature
is
much
rarer
than
erudition
and
it
was
this
enthusiastic
enjoyment
in
akshay
babu
which
used
to
awaken
my
own
literary
appreciation
he
was
as
liberal
in
his
friendships
as
in
his
literary
criticisms
among
strangers
he
was
as
a
fish
out
of
water
but
among
friends
discrepancies
in
wisdom
or
age
made
no
difference
to
him
with
us
boys
he
was
a
boy
when
he
took
his
leave
late
in
the
evening
from
the
of
our
elders
i
would
buttonhole
and
drag
him
to
our
school
room
there
with
undiminished
geniality
he
would
make
himself
the
life
and
soul
of
our
little
gathering
seated
on
the
top
of
our
study
table
on
many
such
occasions
i
have
listened
to
him
going
into
a
rapturous
dissertation
on
some
english
poem
engaged
him
in
some
appreciative
discussion
critical
inquiry
or
hot
dispute
or
read
to
him
some
of
my
own
writings
and
been
rewarded
in
return
with
praise
unsparing
my
fourth
brother
jyotirindra
was
one
of
the
chief
helpers
in
my
literary
and
emotional
training
he
was
an
enthusiast
himself
and
loved
to
evoke
enthusiasm
in
others
he
did
not
allow
the
difference
between
our
ages
to
be
any
bar
to
my
free
intellectual
and
sentimental
intercourse
with
him
this
great
boon
of
freedom
which
he
allowed
me
none
else
would
have
dared
to
do
many
even
blamed
him
for
it
his
companionship
made
it
possible
for
me
to
shake
off
my
shrinking
sensitiveness
it
was
as
necessary
for
my
soul
after
its
rigorous
repression
during
my
infancy
as
are
the
monsoon
clouds
after
a
fiery
summer
but
for
such
snapping
of
my
shackles
i
might
have
become
crippled
for
life
those
in
authority
are
never
tired
of
holding
forth
the
possibility
of
the
abuse
of
freedom
as
a
reason
for
withholding
it
but
without
that
possibility
freedom
would
not
be
really
free
and
the
only
way
of
learning
how
to
use
properly
a
thing
is
through
its
misuse
for
myself
at
least
i
can
truly
say
that
what
little
mischief
resulted
from
my
freedom
always
led
the
way
to
the
means
of
curing
mischief
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
my
own
anything
which
they
tried
to
compel
me
to
swallow
by
getting
hold
of
me
physically
or
mentally
by
the
ears
nothing
but
sorrow
have
i
ever
gained
except
when
left
freely
to
myself
my
brother
jyotirindra
unreservedly
let
me
go
my
own
way
to
and
only
since
then
could
my
nature
prepare
to
put
forth
its
thorns
it
may
be
but
likewise
its
flowers
this
experience
of
mine
has
led
me
to
dread
not
so
much
evil
itself
as
tyrannical
attempts
to
create
goodness
of
punitive
police
political
or
moral
i
have
a
wholesome
horror
the
state
of
slavery
which
is
thus
brought
on
is
the
worst
form
of
cancer
to
which
humanity
is
subject
my
brother
at
one
time
would
spend
days
at
his
piano
engrossed
in
the
creation
of
new
tunes
showers
of
melody
would
stream
from
under
his
dancing
fingers
while
akshay
babu
and
i
seated
on
either
side
would
be
busy
fitting
words
to
the
tunes
as
they
grew
into
shape
to
help
to
hold
them
in
our
memories
this
is
how
i
served
my
apprenticeship
in
the
composition
of
songs
while
we
were
growing
to
boyhood
music
was
largely
cultivated
in
our
family
this
had
the
advantage
of
making
it
possible
for
me
to
imbibe
it
without
an
effort
into
my
whole
being
it
had
also
the
disadvantage
of
not
giving
me
that
technical
mastery
which
the
effort
of
learning
step
by
step
alone
can
give
of
what
may
be
called
proficiency
in
music
therefore
i
acquired
none
ever
since
my
return
from
the
himalayas
it
was
a
case
of
my
getting
more
freedom
more
and
more
the
rule
of
the
servants
came
to
an
end
i
saw
to
it
with
many
a
device
that
the
bonds
of
my
school
life
were
also
loosened
nor
to
my
home
tutors
did
i
give
much
scope
gyan
babu
after
taking
me
through
the
birth
of
the
and
one
or
two
other
books
in
a
desultory
fashion
went
off
to
take
up
a
legal
career
then
came
braja
babu
the
first
day
he
put
me
on
to
translate
the
vicar
of
wakefield
i
found
that
i
did
not
dislike
the
book
but
when
this
encouraged
him
to
make
more
elaborate
arrangements
for
the
advancement
of
my
learning
i
made
myself
altogether
scarce
as
i
have
said
my
elders
gave
me
up
neither
i
nor
they
were
troubled
with
any
more
hopes
of
my
future
so
i
felt
free
to
devote
myself
to
filling
up
my
manuscript
book
and
the
writings
which
thus
filled
it
were
no
better
than
could
have
been
expected
my
mind
had
nothing
in
it
but
hot
vapour
and
bubbles
frothed
and
eddied
round
a
vortex
of
lazy
fancy
aimless
and
unmeaning
no
forms
were
evolved
there
was
only
the
distraction
of
movement
a
bubbling
up
a
bursting
back
into
froth
what
little
of
matter
there
was
in
it
was
not
mine
but
borrowed
from
other
poets
what
was
my
own
was
the
restlessness
the
seething
tension
within
me
when
motion
has
been
born
while
yet
the
balance
of
forces
has
not
matured
then
is
there
blind
chaos
indeed
my
was
a
great
lover
of
literature
she
did
not
read
simply
to
kill
time
but
the
bengali
books
which
she
read
filled
her
whole
mind
i
was
a
partner
in
her
literary
enterprises
she
was
a
devoted
admirer
of
the
dream
journey
so
was
i
the
more
particularly
as
having
been
brought
up
in
the
atmosphere
of
its
creation
its
beauties
had
become
intertwined
with
every
fibre
of
my
heart
fortunately
it
was
entirely
beyond
my
power
of
imitation
so
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
attempt
anything
like
it
the
dream
journey
may
be
likened
to
a
superb
palace
of
allegory
with
innumerable
halls
chambers
passages
corners
and
niches
full
of
statuary
and
pictures
of
wonderful
design
and
workmanship
and
in
the
grounds
around
gardens
bowers
fountains
and
shady
nooks
in
profusion
not
only
do
poetic
thought
and
fancy
abound
but
the
richness
and
variety
of
language
and
expression
is
also
marvellous
it
is
not
a
small
thing
this
creative
power
which
can
bring
into
being
so
magnificent
a
structure
complete
in
all
its
artistic
detail
and
that
is
perhaps
why
the
idea
of
attempting
an
imitation
never
occurred
to
me
at
this
time
viharilal
chakravarti
series
of
songs
called
were
coming
out
in
the
my
was
greatly
taken
with
the
sweetness
of
these
lyrics
most
of
them
she
knew
by
heart
she
used
often
to
invite
the
poet
to
our
house
and
had
embroidered
for
him
a
with
her
own
hands
this
gave
me
the
opportunity
of
making
friends
with
him
he
came
to
have
a
great
affection
for
me
and
i
took
to
dropping
in
at
his
house
at
all
times
of
the
day
morning
noon
or
evening
his
heart
was
as
large
as
his
body
and
a
halo
of
fancy
used
to
surround
him
like
a
poetic
astral
body
which
seemed
to
be
his
truer
image
he
was
always
full
of
true
artistic
joy
and
whenever
i
have
been
to
him
i
have
breathed
in
my
share
of
it
often
have
i
come
upon
him
in
his
little
room
on
the
third
storey
in
the
heat
of
noonday
sprawling
on
the
cool
polished
cement
floor
writing
his
poems
mere
boy
though
i
was
his
welcome
was
always
so
genuine
and
hearty
that
i
never
felt
the
least
awkwardness
in
approaching
him
then
wrapt
in
his
inspiration
and
forgetful
of
all
surroundings
he
would
read
out
his
poems
or
sing
his
songs
to
me
not
that
he
had
much
of
the
gift
of
song
in
his
voice
but
then
he
was
not
altogether
tuneless
and
one
could
get
a
fair
idea
of
the
intended
melody
when
with
eyes
closed
he
raised
his
rich
deep
voice
its
expressiveness
made
up
for
what
it
lacked
in
execution
i
still
seem
to
hear
some
of
his
songs
as
he
sang
them
i
would
also
sometimes
set
his
words
to
music
and
sing
them
to
him
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
valmiki
and
kalidas
i
remember
how
once
after
reciting
a
description
of
the
himalayas
from
kalidas
with
the
full
strength
of
his
voice
he
said
the
succession
of
long
sounds
here
is
not
an
accident
the
poet
has
deliberately
repeated
this
sound
all
the
way
from
down
to
as
an
assistance
in
realising
the
glorious
expanse
of
the
himalayas
at
the
time
the
height
of
my
ambition
was
to
become
a
poet
like
vihari
babu
i
might
have
even
succeeded
in
working
myself
up
to
the
belief
that
i
was
actually
writing
like
him
but
for
my
his
zealous
devotee
who
stood
in
the
way
she
would
keep
reminding
me
of
a
sanskrit
saying
that
the
unworthy
aspirant
after
poetic
fame
departs
in
jeers
very
possibly
she
knew
that
if
my
vanity
was
once
allowed
to
get
the
upper
hand
it
would
be
difficult
afterwards
to
bring
it
under
control
so
neither
my
poetic
abilities
nor
my
powers
of
song
readily
received
any
praise
from
her
rather
would
she
never
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
praising
somebody
else
singing
at
my
expense
with
the
result
that
i
gradually
became
quite
convinced
of
the
defects
of
my
voice
misgivings
about
my
poetic
powers
also
assailed
me
but
as
this
was
the
only
field
of
activity
left
in
which
i
had
any
chance
of
retaining
my
i
could
not
allow
the
judgment
of
another
to
deprive
me
of
all
hope
moreover
so
insistent
was
the
spur
within
me
that
to
stop
my
poetic
adventure
was
a
matter
of
sheer
impossibility
my
writings
so
far
had
been
confined
to
the
family
circle
then
was
started
the
monthly
called
the
sprouting
knowledge
and
as
befitted
its
name
it
secured
an
embryo
poet
as
one
of
its
contributors
it
began
to
publish
all
my
poetic
ravings
indiscriminately
and
to
this
day
i
have
in
a
corner
of
my
mind
the
fear
that
when
the
day
of
judgment
comes
for
me
some
enthusiastic
literary
will
institute
a
search
in
the
inmost
zenana
of
forgotten
literature
regardless
of
the
claims
of
privacy
and
bring
these
out
before
the
pitiless
public
gaze
my
first
prose
writing
also
saw
the
light
in
the
pages
of
the
it
was
a
critical
essay
and
had
a
bit
of
a
history
a
book
of
poems
had
been
published
entitled
akshay
babu
in
the
and
bhudeb
babu
in
the
hailed
this
new
poet
with
effusive
acclamation
a
friend
of
mine
older
than
myself
whose
friendship
dates
from
then
would
come
and
show
me
letters
he
had
received
signed
he
was
one
of
those
whom
the
book
had
captivated
and
used
frequently
to
send
reverential
offerings
of
books
or
cloth
to
the
address
of
the
reputed
authoress
some
of
these
poems
were
so
wanting
in
restraint
both
of
thought
and
language
that
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
their
being
written
by
a
woman
the
letters
that
were
shown
to
me
made
it
still
less
possible
for
me
to
believe
in
the
womanliness
of
the
writer
but
my
doubts
did
not
shake
my
friend
devotion
and
he
went
on
with
the
worship
of
his
idol
then
i
launched
into
a
criticism
of
the
work
of
this
writer
i
let
myself
go
and
eruditely
held
forth
on
the
distinctive
features
of
lyrics
and
other
short
poems
my
great
advantage
being
that
printed
matter
is
so
unblushing
so
impassively
unbetraying
of
the
writer
real
attainments
my
friend
turned
up
in
a
great
passion
and
hurled
at
me
the
threat
that
a
was
writing
a
reply
a
i
was
struck
speechless
i
felt
the
same
as
in
my
younger
days
when
my
nephew
satya
had
shouted
for
a
policeman
i
could
see
the
triumphal
pillar
of
argument
erected
upon
my
nice
distinctions
crumbling
before
my
eyes
at
the
merciless
assaults
of
authoritative
quotations
and
the
door
effectually
barred
against
my
ever
showing
my
face
to
the
reading
public
again
alas
my
critique
under
what
evil
star
wert
thou
born
i
spent
day
after
day
in
the
direst
suspense
but
like
satya
policeman
the
failed
to
appear
as
i
have
said
i
was
a
keen
student
of
the
series
of
old
vaishnava
poems
which
were
being
collected
and
published
by
babus
akshay
sarkar
and
saroda
mitter
their
language
largely
mixed
with
maithili
i
found
difficult
to
understand
but
for
that
very
reason
i
took
all
the
more
pains
to
get
at
their
meaning
my
feeling
towards
them
was
that
same
eager
curiosity
with
which
i
regarded
the
ungerminated
sprout
within
the
seed
or
the
undiscovered
mystery
under
the
dust
covering
of
the
earth
my
enthusiasm
was
kept
up
with
the
hope
of
bringing
to
light
some
unknown
poetical
gems
as
i
went
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
unexplored
darkness
of
this
while
i
was
so
engaged
the
idea
got
hold
of
me
of
enfolding
my
own
writings
in
just
such
a
wrapping
of
mystery
i
had
heard
from
akshay
chowdhury
the
story
of
the
english
chatterton
what
his
poetry
was
like
i
had
no
idea
nor
perhaps
had
akshay
babu
himself
had
we
known
the
story
might
have
lost
its
charm
as
it
happened
the
melodramatic
element
in
it
fired
my
imagination
for
had
not
so
many
been
deceived
by
his
successful
imitation
of
the
classics
and
at
last
the
unfortunate
youth
had
died
by
his
own
hand
leaving
aside
the
suicide
part
i
girded
up
my
loins
to
emulate
young
exploits
one
noon
the
clouds
had
gathered
thickly
rejoicing
in
the
grateful
shade
of
the
cloudy
midday
i
lay
prone
on
the
bed
in
my
inner
room
and
wrote
on
a
slate
the
imitation
poem
kusuma
kunja
i
was
greatly
pleased
with
it
and
lost
no
time
in
reading
it
out
to
the
first
one
i
came
across
of
whose
understanding
a
word
of
it
there
happened
to
be
not
the
slightest
danger
and
who
consequently
could
not
but
gravely
nod
and
say
good
very
good
indeed
to
my
friend
mentioned
a
while
ago
i
said
one
day
a
tattered
old
manuscript
has
been
discovered
while
rummaging
in
the
brahma
library
and
from
this
i
have
copied
some
poems
by
an
old
vaishnava
poet
named
bhanu
singha
with
which
i
read
some
of
my
imitation
poems
to
him
he
was
profoundly
stirred
these
could
not
have
been
written
even
by
or
he
rapturously
exclaimed
i
really
must
have
that
to
make
over
to
akshay
babu
for
publication
then
i
showed
him
my
manuscript
book
and
conclusively
proved
that
the
poems
could
not
have
been
written
by
either
or
because
the
author
happened
to
be
myself
my
friend
face
fell
as
he
muttered
yes
yes
they
not
half
bad
when
these
bhanu
singha
poems
were
coming
out
in
the
nishikanta
chatterjee
was
in
germany
he
wrote
a
thesis
on
the
lyric
poetry
of
our
country
comparing
it
with
that
of
europe
bhanu
singha
was
given
a
place
of
honour
as
one
of
the
old
poets
such
as
no
modern
writer
could
have
aspired
to
this
was
the
thesis
on
which
nishikanta
chatterjee
got
his
ph
whoever
bhanu
singha
might
have
been
had
his
writings
fallen
into
the
hands
of
me
i
swear
i
would
not
have
been
deceived
the
language
might
have
passed
muster
for
that
which
the
old
poets
wrote
in
was
not
their
mother
tongue
but
an
artificial
language
varying
in
the
hands
of
different
poets
but
there
was
nothing
artificial
about
their
sentiments
any
attempt
to
test
bhanu
singha
poetry
by
its
ring
would
have
shown
up
the
base
metal
it
had
none
of
the
ravishing
melody
of
our
ancient
pipes
but
only
the
tinkle
of
a
modern
foreign
barrel
organ
from
an
outside
point
of
view
many
a
foreign
custom
would
appear
to
have
gained
entry
into
our
family
but
at
its
heart
flames
a
national
pride
which
has
never
flickered
the
genuine
regard
which
my
father
had
for
his
country
never
forsook
him
through
all
the
revolutionary
vicissitudes
of
his
life
and
this
in
his
descendants
has
taken
shape
as
a
strong
patriotic
feeling
love
of
country
was
however
by
no
means
a
characteristic
of
the
times
of
which
i
am
writing
our
educated
men
then
kept
at
arms
length
both
the
language
and
thought
of
their
native
land
nevertheless
my
elder
brothers
had
always
cultivated
bengali
literature
when
on
one
occasion
some
new
connection
by
marriage
wrote
my
father
an
english
letter
it
was
promptly
returned
to
the
writer
the
was
an
annual
fair
which
had
been
instituted
with
the
assistance
of
our
house
babu
nabagopal
mitter
was
appointed
its
manager
this
was
perhaps
the
first
attempt
at
a
reverential
realisation
of
india
as
our
motherland
my
second
brother
popular
national
anthem
was
composed
then
the
singing
of
songs
glorifying
the
motherland
the
recitation
of
poems
of
the
love
of
country
the
exhibition
of
indigenous
arts
and
crafts
and
the
encouragement
of
national
talent
and
skill
were
the
features
of
this
on
the
occasion
of
lord
curzon
delhi
durbar
i
wrote
a
at
the
time
of
lord
lytton
it
was
a
poem
the
british
government
of
those
days
feared
the
russians
it
is
true
but
not
the
pen
of
a
old
poet
so
though
my
poem
lacked
none
of
the
fiery
sentiments
appropriate
to
my
age
there
were
no
signs
of
any
consternation
in
the
ranks
of
the
authorities
from
down
to
commissioner
of
police
nor
did
any
lachrymose
letter
in
the
predict
a
speedy
downfall
of
the
empire
for
this
apathy
of
its
local
guardians
i
recited
my
poem
under
a
tree
at
the
hindu
mela
and
one
of
my
hearers
was
nabin
sen
the
poet
he
reminded
me
of
this
after
i
had
grown
up
my
fourth
brother
jyotirindra
was
responsible
for
a
political
association
of
which
old
rajnarain
bose
was
the
president
it
held
its
sittings
in
a
tumbledown
building
in
an
obscure
calcutta
lane
its
proceedings
were
enshrouded
in
mystery
this
mystery
was
its
only
claim
to
be
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
nothing
in
our
deliberations
or
doings
of
which
government
or
people
need
have
been
afraid
the
rest
of
our
family
had
no
idea
where
we
were
spending
our
afternoons
our
front
door
would
be
locked
the
meeting
room
in
darkness
the
watchword
a
vedic
our
talk
in
whispers
these
alone
provided
us
with
enough
of
a
thrill
and
we
wanted
nothing
more
mere
child
as
i
was
i
also
was
a
member
we
surrounded
ourselves
with
such
an
atmosphere
of
pure
frenzy
that
we
always
seemed
to
be
soaring
aloft
on
the
wings
of
our
enthusiasm
of
bashfulness
diffidence
or
fear
we
had
none
our
main
object
being
to
bask
in
the
heat
of
our
own
fervour
bravery
may
sometimes
have
its
drawbacks
but
it
has
always
maintained
a
deep
hold
on
the
reverence
of
mankind
in
the
literature
of
all
countries
we
find
an
unflagging
endeavour
to
keep
alive
this
reverence
so
in
whatever
state
a
particular
set
of
men
in
a
particular
locality
may
be
they
can
not
escape
the
constant
impact
of
these
stimulating
shocks
we
had
to
be
content
with
responding
to
such
shocks
as
best
we
could
by
letting
loose
our
imagination
coming
together
talking
tall
and
singing
fervently
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
closing
up
all
outlets
and
barring
all
openings
to
a
faculty
so
in
the
nature
of
man
and
moreover
so
prized
by
him
creates
an
unnatural
condition
favourable
to
degenerate
activity
it
is
not
enough
to
keep
open
only
the
avenues
to
clerical
employment
in
any
comprehensive
scheme
of
imperial
government
if
no
road
be
left
for
adventurous
daring
the
soul
of
man
will
pine
for
deliverance
and
secret
passages
still
be
sought
of
which
the
pathways
are
tortuous
and
the
end
unthinkable
i
firmly
believe
that
if
in
those
days
government
had
paraded
a
frightfulness
born
of
suspicion
then
the
comedy
which
the
youthful
members
of
this
association
had
been
at
might
have
turned
into
grim
tragedy
the
play
however
is
over
not
a
brick
of
is
any
the
worse
and
we
are
now
smiling
at
its
memory
my
brother
jyotirindra
began
to
busy
himself
with
a
national
costume
for
all
india
and
submitted
various
designs
to
the
association
the
was
not
deemed
trousers
were
too
foreign
so
he
hit
upon
a
compromise
which
considerably
detracted
from
the
dhoti
while
failing
to
improve
the
trousers
that
is
to
say
the
trousers
were
decorated
with
the
addition
of
a
false
in
front
and
behind
the
fearsome
thing
that
resulted
from
combining
a
turban
with
a
our
most
enthusiastic
member
would
not
have
had
the
temerity
to
call
ornamental
no
person
of
ordinary
courage
could
have
dared
it
but
my
brother
unflinchingly
wore
the
complete
suit
in
broad
passing
through
the
house
of
an
afternoon
to
the
carriage
waiting
outside
indifferent
alike
to
the
stare
of
relation
or
friend
or
coachman
there
may
be
many
a
brave
indian
ready
to
die
for
his
country
but
there
are
but
few
i
am
sure
who
even
for
the
good
of
the
nation
would
face
the
public
streets
in
such
garb
every
sunday
my
brother
would
get
up
a
party
many
of
those
who
joined
in
it
uninvited
we
did
not
even
know
there
was
a
carpenter
a
smith
and
others
from
all
ranks
of
society
bloodshed
was
the
only
thing
lacking
in
this
at
least
i
can
not
recall
any
its
other
appendages
were
so
abundant
and
satisfying
that
we
felt
the
absence
of
dead
or
wounded
game
to
be
a
trifling
circumstance
of
no
account
as
we
were
out
from
early
morning
my
furnished
us
with
a
plentiful
supply
of
with
appropriate
accompaniments
and
as
these
did
not
depend
upon
the
fortunes
of
our
chase
we
never
had
to
return
empty
the
neighbourhood
of
maniktola
is
not
wanting
in
we
would
turn
into
any
one
of
these
at
the
end
and
alike
seated
on
the
bathing
platform
of
a
tank
would
fling
ourselves
on
the
in
right
good
earnest
all
that
was
left
of
them
being
the
vessels
they
were
brought
in
braja
babu
was
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
of
these
he
was
the
superintendent
of
the
metropolitan
institution
and
had
also
been
our
private
tutor
for
a
time
one
day
he
had
the
happy
idea
of
accosting
the
gardener
of
a
into
which
we
had
thus
trespassed
with
hallo
has
uncle
been
here
lately
the
lost
no
time
in
saluting
him
respectfully
before
he
replied
no
sir
the
master
has
been
lately
all
right
get
us
some
green
cocoanuts
off
the
trees
we
had
a
fine
drink
after
our
that
day
a
zamindar
in
a
small
way
was
among
our
party
he
owned
a
villa
on
the
river
side
one
day
we
had
a
picnic
there
together
in
defiance
of
caste
rules
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
tremendous
storm
we
stood
on
the
stairs
leading
into
the
water
and
shouted
out
songs
to
its
accompaniment
i
can
not
truthfully
assert
that
all
the
seven
notes
of
the
scale
could
properly
be
distinguished
in
rajnarain
babu
singing
nevertheless
he
sent
forth
his
voice
and
as
in
the
old
sanskrit
works
the
text
is
drowned
by
the
notes
so
in
rajnarain
babu
musical
efforts
the
vigorous
play
of
his
limbs
and
features
overwhelmed
his
feebler
vocal
performance
his
head
swung
from
side
to
side
marking
time
while
the
storm
played
havoc
with
his
flowing
beard
it
was
late
in
the
night
when
we
turned
homewards
in
a
hackney
carriage
by
that
time
the
storm
clouds
had
dispersed
and
the
stars
twinkled
forth
the
darkness
had
become
intense
the
atmosphere
silent
the
village
roads
deserted
and
the
thickets
on
either
side
filled
with
fireflies
like
a
carnival
of
sparks
scattered
in
some
noiseless
revelry
one
of
the
objects
of
our
association
was
to
encourage
the
manufacture
of
lucifer
matches
and
similar
small
industries
for
this
purpose
each
member
had
to
contribute
a
tenth
of
his
income
matches
had
to
be
made
but
matchwood
was
difficult
to
get
for
though
we
all
know
with
what
fiery
energy
a
bundle
of
can
be
wielded
in
capable
hands
the
thing
that
burns
at
its
touch
is
not
a
lamp
wick
after
many
experiments
we
succeeded
in
making
a
boxful
of
matches
the
patriotic
enthusiasm
which
was
thus
evidenced
did
not
constitute
their
only
value
for
the
money
that
was
spent
in
their
making
might
have
served
to
light
the
family
hearth
for
the
space
of
a
year
another
little
defect
was
that
these
matches
could
not
be
got
to
burn
unless
there
was
a
light
handy
to
touch
them
up
with
if
they
could
only
have
inherited
some
of
the
patriotic
flame
of
which
they
were
born
they
might
have
been
marketable
even
news
came
to
us
that
some
young
student
was
trying
to
make
a
power
loom
off
we
went
to
see
it
none
of
us
had
the
knowledge
with
which
to
test
its
practical
usefulness
but
in
our
capacity
for
believing
and
hoping
we
were
inferior
to
none
the
poor
fellow
had
got
into
a
bit
of
debt
over
the
cost
of
his
machine
which
we
repaid
for
him
then
one
day
we
found
braja
babu
coming
over
to
our
house
with
a
flimsy
country
towel
tied
round
his
head
made
in
our
loom
he
shouted
as
with
hands
uplifted
he
executed
a
the
outside
of
braja
babu
head
had
then
already
begun
to
ripen
into
grey
at
last
some
people
came
and
joined
our
society
made
us
taste
of
the
fruit
of
knowledge
and
broke
up
our
little
paradise
when
i
first
knew
rajnarain
babu
i
was
not
old
enough
to
appreciate
his
in
him
were
combined
many
opposites
in
spite
of
his
hoary
hair
and
beard
he
was
as
young
as
the
youngest
of
us
his
venerable
exterior
serving
only
as
a
white
mantle
for
keeping
his
youth
perpetually
fresh
even
his
extensive
learning
had
not
been
able
to
do
him
any
damage
for
it
left
him
absolutely
simple
to
the
end
of
his
life
the
incessant
flow
of
his
hearty
laughter
suffered
no
check
neither
from
the
gravity
of
age
nor
nor
domestic
affliction
nor
profundity
of
thought
nor
variety
of
knowledge
all
of
which
had
been
his
in
ample
measure
he
had
been
a
favourite
pupil
of
richardson
and
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
of
english
learning
nevertheless
he
flung
aside
all
obstacles
due
to
his
early
habit
and
gave
himself
up
lovingly
and
devotedly
to
bengali
literature
though
the
meekest
of
men
he
was
full
of
fire
which
flamed
its
fiercest
in
his
patriotism
as
though
to
burn
to
ashes
the
shortcomings
and
destitution
of
his
country
the
memory
of
this
saint
is
one
that
is
worth
cherishing
by
our
countrymen
on
the
whole
the
period
of
which
i
am
writing
was
for
me
one
of
ecstatic
excitement
many
a
night
have
i
spent
without
sleep
not
for
any
particular
reason
but
from
a
mere
desire
to
do
the
reverse
of
the
obvious
i
would
keep
up
reading
in
the
dim
light
of
our
school
room
all
alone
the
distant
church
clock
would
chime
every
quarter
as
if
each
passing
hour
was
being
put
up
to
auction
and
the
loud
of
the
bearers
of
the
dead
passing
along
chitpore
road
on
their
way
to
the
nimtollah
cremation
ground
would
now
and
then
resound
through
some
summer
moonlight
nights
i
would
be
wandering
about
like
an
unquiet
spirit
among
the
lights
and
shadows
of
the
tubs
and
pots
on
the
garden
of
the
those
who
would
dismiss
this
as
sheer
poetising
would
be
wrong
the
very
earth
in
spite
of
its
having
aged
considerably
surprises
us
occasionally
by
its
departure
from
sober
stability
in
the
days
of
its
youth
when
it
had
not
become
hardened
and
crusty
it
was
effusively
volcanic
and
indulged
in
many
a
wild
escapade
in
the
days
of
man
first
youth
the
same
sort
of
thing
happens
so
long
as
the
materials
which
go
to
form
his
life
have
not
taken
on
their
final
shape
they
are
apt
to
be
turbulent
in
the
process
of
their
formation
this
was
the
time
when
my
brother
jyotirindra
decided
to
start
the
with
our
eldest
brother
as
editor
giving
us
fresh
food
for
enthusiasm
i
was
then
just
sixteen
but
i
was
not
left
out
of
the
editorial
staff
a
short
time
before
in
all
the
insolence
of
my
youthful
vanity
i
had
written
a
criticism
of
the
as
acidity
is
characteristic
of
the
unripe
mango
so
is
abuse
of
the
immature
critic
when
other
powers
are
lacking
the
power
of
pricking
seems
to
be
at
its
sharpest
i
had
thus
sought
immortality
by
leaving
my
scratches
on
that
immortal
epic
this
impudent
criticism
was
my
first
contribution
to
the
bharati
in
the
first
volume
i
also
published
a
long
poem
called
the
poet
story
it
was
the
product
of
an
age
when
the
writer
had
seen
practically
nothing
of
the
world
except
an
exaggerated
image
of
his
own
nebulous
self
so
the
hero
of
the
story
was
naturally
a
poet
not
the
writer
as
he
was
but
as
he
imagined
or
desired
himself
to
seem
it
would
hardly
be
correct
to
say
that
he
desired
to
what
he
portrayed
that
represented
more
what
he
thought
was
expected
of
him
what
would
make
the
world
admiringly
nod
and
say
yes
a
poet
indeed
quite
the
correct
thing
in
it
was
a
great
parade
of
universal
love
that
pet
subject
of
the
budding
poet
which
sounds
as
big
as
it
is
easy
to
talk
about
while
yet
any
truth
has
not
dawned
upon
one
own
mind
and
others
words
are
one
only
simplicity
and
restraint
in
expression
are
not
possible
then
in
the
endeavour
to
display
magnified
that
which
is
really
big
in
itself
it
becomes
impossible
to
avoid
a
grotesque
and
ridiculous
exhibition
when
i
blush
to
read
these
effusions
of
my
boyhood
i
am
also
struck
with
the
fear
that
very
possibly
in
my
later
writings
the
same
distortion
wrought
by
straining
after
effect
lurks
in
a
less
obvious
form
the
loudness
of
my
voice
i
doubt
not
often
drowns
the
thing
i
would
say
and
some
day
or
other
time
will
find
me
out
the
was
the
first
work
of
mine
to
appear
in
book
form
when
i
went
with
my
second
brother
to
ahmedabad
some
enthusiastic
friend
of
mine
took
me
by
surprise
by
printing
and
publishing
it
and
sending
me
a
copy
i
can
not
say
that
he
did
well
but
the
feeling
that
was
roused
in
me
at
the
time
did
not
resemble
that
of
an
indignant
judge
he
got
his
punishment
however
not
from
the
author
but
from
the
public
who
hold
the
purse
strings
i
have
heard
that
the
dead
load
of
the
books
lay
for
many
a
long
day
heavy
on
the
shelves
of
the
booksellers
and
the
mind
of
the
luckless
publisher
writings
of
the
age
at
which
i
began
to
contribute
to
the
can
not
possibly
be
fit
for
publication
there
is
no
better
way
of
ensuring
repentance
at
maturity
than
to
rush
into
print
too
early
but
it
has
one
redeeming
feature
the
irresistible
impulse
to
see
writings
in
print
exhausts
itself
during
early
life
who
are
the
readers
what
do
they
say
what
printers
errors
have
remained
uncorrected
these
and
the
like
worries
run
their
course
as
infantile
maladies
and
leave
one
leisure
in
later
life
to
attend
to
one
literary
work
in
a
healthier
frame
of
mind
bengali
literature
is
not
old
enough
to
have
elaborated
those
internal
checks
which
can
serve
to
control
its
votaries
as
experience
in
writing
is
gained
the
bengali
writer
has
to
evolve
the
restraining
force
from
within
himself
this
makes
it
impossible
for
him
to
avoid
the
creation
of
a
great
deal
of
rubbish
during
a
considerable
length
of
time
the
ambition
to
work
wonders
with
the
modest
gifts
at
one
disposal
is
bound
to
be
an
obsession
in
the
beginning
so
that
the
effort
to
transcend
at
every
step
one
natural
powers
and
therewith
the
bounds
of
truth
and
beauty
is
always
visible
in
early
writings
to
recover
one
normal
self
to
learn
to
respect
one
powers
as
they
are
is
a
matter
of
time
however
that
may
be
i
have
left
much
of
youthful
folly
to
be
ashamed
of
besmirching
the
pages
of
the
and
this
shames
me
not
for
its
literary
defects
alone
but
for
its
atrocious
impudence
its
extravagant
excesses
and
its
artificiality
at
the
same
time
i
am
free
to
recognise
that
the
writings
of
that
period
were
pervaded
with
an
enthusiasm
the
value
of
which
can
not
be
small
it
was
a
period
to
which
if
error
was
natural
so
was
the
boyish
faculty
of
hoping
believing
and
rejoicing
and
if
the
fuel
of
error
was
necessary
for
feeding
the
flame
of
enthusiasm
then
while
that
which
was
fit
to
be
reduced
to
ashes
will
have
become
ash
the
good
work
done
by
the
flame
will
not
have
been
in
vain
in
my
life
part
v
when
the
entered
upon
its
second
year
my
second
brother
proposed
to
take
me
to
england
and
when
my
father
gave
his
consent
this
further
unasked
favour
of
providence
came
on
me
as
a
surprise
as
a
first
step
i
accompanied
my
brother
to
ahmedabad
where
he
was
posted
as
judge
my
with
her
children
was
then
in
england
so
the
house
was
practically
empty
the
judge
house
is
known
as
and
was
a
palace
of
the
badshahs
of
old
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
supporting
a
broad
terrace
flowed
the
thin
summer
stream
of
the
savarmati
river
along
one
edge
of
its
ample
bed
of
sand
my
brother
used
to
go
off
to
his
court
and
i
would
be
left
all
alone
in
the
vast
expanse
of
the
palace
with
only
the
cooing
of
the
pigeons
to
break
the
midday
stillness
and
an
unaccountable
curiosity
kept
me
wandering
about
the
empty
rooms
into
the
niches
in
the
wall
of
a
large
chamber
my
brother
had
put
his
books
one
of
these
was
a
gorgeous
edition
of
tennyson
works
with
big
print
and
numerous
pictures
the
book
for
me
was
as
silent
as
the
palace
and
much
in
the
same
way
i
wandered
among
its
picture
plates
not
that
i
could
not
make
anything
of
the
text
but
it
spoke
to
me
more
like
inarticulate
cooings
than
words
in
my
brother
library
i
also
found
a
book
of
collected
sanskrit
poems
edited
by
haberlin
and
printed
at
the
old
serampore
press
this
was
also
beyond
my
understanding
but
the
sonorous
sanskrit
words
and
the
march
of
the
metre
kept
me
tramping
among
the
poems
to
the
mellow
roll
of
their
drum
call
in
the
upper
room
of
the
palace
tower
was
my
lonely
hermit
cell
my
only
companions
being
a
nest
of
wasps
in
the
unrelieved
darkness
of
the
night
i
slept
there
alone
sometimes
a
wasp
or
two
would
drop
off
the
nest
on
to
my
bed
and
if
perchance
i
happened
to
roll
on
one
the
meeting
was
unpleasing
to
the
wasp
and
keenly
discomforting
to
me
on
moonlight
nights
pacing
round
and
round
the
extensive
terrace
overlooking
the
river
was
one
of
my
caprices
it
was
while
so
doing
that
i
first
composed
my
own
tunes
for
my
songs
the
song
addressed
to
the
was
one
of
these
and
it
still
finds
a
place
in
my
published
works
finding
how
imperfect
was
my
knowledge
of
english
i
set
to
work
reading
through
some
english
books
with
the
help
of
a
dictionary
from
my
earliest
years
it
was
my
habit
not
to
let
any
want
of
complete
comprehension
interfere
with
my
reading
on
quite
satisfied
with
the
structure
which
my
imagination
reared
on
the
bits
which
i
understood
here
and
there
i
am
reaping
even
both
the
good
and
bad
effects
of
this
habit
after
six
months
thus
spent
in
ahmedabad
we
started
for
england
in
an
unlucky
moment
i
began
to
write
letters
about
my
journey
to
my
relatives
and
to
the
now
it
is
beyond
my
power
to
call
them
back
these
were
nothing
but
the
outcome
of
youthful
bravado
at
that
age
the
mind
refuses
to
admit
that
its
greatest
pride
is
in
its
power
to
understand
to
accept
to
respect
and
that
modesty
is
the
best
means
of
enlarging
its
domain
admiration
and
praise
are
looked
upon
as
a
sign
of
weakness
or
surrender
and
the
desire
to
cry
down
and
hurt
and
demolish
with
argument
gives
rise
to
this
kind
of
intellectual
fireworks
these
attempts
of
mine
to
establish
my
superiority
by
revilement
might
have
occasioned
me
amusement
had
not
their
want
of
straightness
and
common
courtesy
been
too
painful
from
my
earliest
years
i
had
had
practically
no
commerce
with
the
outside
world
to
be
plunged
in
this
state
at
the
age
of
into
the
midst
of
the
social
sea
of
england
would
have
justified
considerable
misgiving
as
to
my
being
able
to
keep
afloat
but
as
my
happened
to
be
in
brighton
with
her
children
i
weathered
the
first
shock
of
it
under
her
shelter
winter
was
then
approaching
one
evening
as
we
were
chatting
round
the
fireside
the
children
came
running
to
us
with
the
exciting
news
that
it
had
been
snowing
we
at
once
went
out
it
was
bitingly
cold
the
sky
filled
with
white
moonlight
the
earth
covered
with
white
snow
it
was
not
the
face
of
nature
familiar
to
me
but
something
quite
different
like
a
dream
everything
near
seemed
to
have
receded
far
away
leaving
the
still
white
figure
of
an
ascetic
steeped
in
deep
meditation
the
sudden
revelation
on
the
mere
stepping
outside
a
door
of
such
wonderful
such
immense
beauty
had
never
before
come
upon
me
my
days
passed
merrily
under
the
affectionate
care
of
my
and
in
boisterous
rompings
with
the
children
they
were
greatly
tickled
at
my
curious
english
pronunciation
and
though
in
the
rest
of
their
games
i
could
join
this
i
failed
to
see
the
fun
of
how
could
i
explain
to
them
that
there
was
no
logical
means
of
distinguishing
between
the
sound
of
in
warm
and
in
worm
unlucky
that
i
was
i
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
ridicule
which
was
more
properly
the
due
of
the
vagaries
of
english
spelling
i
became
quite
an
adept
in
inventing
new
ways
of
keeping
the
children
occupied
and
amused
this
art
has
stood
me
in
good
stead
many
a
time
thereafter
and
its
usefulness
for
me
is
not
yet
over
but
i
no
longer
feel
in
myself
the
same
unbounded
profusion
of
ready
contrivance
that
was
the
first
opportunity
i
had
for
giving
my
heart
to
children
and
it
had
all
the
freshness
and
overflowing
exuberance
of
such
a
first
gift
but
i
had
not
set
out
on
this
journey
to
exchange
a
home
beyond
the
seas
for
the
one
on
this
side
the
idea
was
that
i
should
study
law
and
come
back
a
barrister
so
one
day
i
was
put
into
a
public
school
in
brighton
the
first
thing
the
headmaster
said
after
scanning
my
features
was
what
a
splendid
head
you
have
this
detail
lingers
in
my
memory
because
she
who
at
home
was
an
enthusiast
in
her
duty
of
keeping
my
vanity
in
check
had
impressed
on
me
that
my
cranium
and
features
generally
compared
with
that
of
many
another
were
barely
of
a
medium
order
i
hope
the
reader
will
not
fail
to
count
it
to
my
credit
that
i
implicitly
believed
her
and
inwardly
deplored
the
parsimony
of
the
creator
in
the
matter
of
my
making
on
many
another
occasion
finding
myself
estimated
by
my
english
acquaintances
differently
from
what
i
had
been
accustomed
to
be
by
her
i
was
led
to
seriously
worry
my
mind
over
the
divergence
in
the
standard
of
taste
between
the
two
countries
one
thing
in
the
brighton
school
seemed
very
wonderful
the
other
boys
were
not
at
all
rude
to
me
on
the
contrary
they
would
often
thrust
oranges
and
apples
into
my
pockets
and
run
away
i
can
only
ascribe
this
uncommon
behaviour
of
theirs
to
my
being
a
foreigner
i
was
not
long
in
this
school
either
but
that
was
no
fault
of
the
school
tarak
palit
was
then
in
england
he
could
see
that
this
was
not
the
way
for
me
to
get
on
and
prevailed
upon
my
brother
to
allow
him
to
take
me
to
london
and
leave
me
there
to
myself
in
a
lodging
house
the
lodgings
selected
faced
the
regent
gardens
it
was
then
the
depth
of
winter
there
was
not
a
leaf
on
the
row
of
trees
in
front
which
stood
staring
at
the
sky
with
their
scraggy
branches
a
sight
which
chilled
my
very
bones
for
the
newly
arrived
stranger
there
can
hardly
be
a
more
cruel
place
than
london
in
winter
i
knew
no
one
near
by
nor
could
i
find
my
way
about
the
days
of
sitting
alone
at
a
window
gazing
at
the
outside
world
came
back
into
my
life
but
the
scene
in
this
case
was
not
attractive
there
was
a
frown
on
its
countenance
the
sky
turbid
the
light
lacking
lustre
like
a
dead
man
eye
the
horizon
shrunk
upon
itself
with
never
an
inviting
smile
from
a
broad
hospitable
world
the
room
was
but
scantily
furnished
but
there
happened
to
be
a
harmonium
which
after
the
daylight
came
to
its
untimely
end
i
used
to
play
upon
according
to
my
fancy
sometimes
indians
would
come
to
see
me
and
though
my
acquaintance
with
them
was
but
slight
when
they
rose
to
leave
i
felt
inclined
to
hold
them
back
by
their
while
living
in
these
rooms
there
was
one
who
came
to
teach
me
latin
his
gaunt
figure
with
its
clothing
seemed
no
more
able
than
the
naked
trees
to
withstand
the
winter
grip
i
do
not
know
what
his
age
was
but
he
clearly
looked
older
than
his
years
some
days
in
the
course
of
our
lessons
he
would
suddenly
be
at
a
loss
for
some
word
and
look
vacant
and
ashamed
his
people
at
home
counted
him
a
crank
he
had
become
possessed
of
a
theory
he
believed
that
in
each
age
some
one
dominant
idea
is
manifested
in
every
human
society
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
though
it
may
take
different
shapes
under
different
degrees
of
civilisation
it
is
at
bottom
one
and
the
same
nor
is
such
idea
taken
from
one
by
another
by
any
process
of
adoption
for
this
truth
holds
good
even
where
there
is
no
intercourse
his
great
preoccupation
was
the
gathering
and
recording
of
facts
to
prove
this
theory
and
while
so
engaged
his
home
lacked
food
his
body
clothes
his
daughters
had
but
scant
respect
for
his
theory
and
were
perhaps
constantly
upbraiding
him
for
his
infatuation
some
days
one
could
see
from
his
face
that
he
had
lighted
upon
some
new
proof
and
that
his
thesis
had
correspondingly
advanced
on
these
occasions
i
would
broach
the
subject
and
wax
enthusiastic
at
his
enthusiasm
on
other
days
he
would
be
steeped
in
gloom
as
if
his
burden
was
too
heavy
to
bear
then
would
our
lessons
halt
at
every
step
his
eyes
wander
away
into
empty
space
and
his
mind
refuse
to
be
dragged
into
the
pages
of
the
first
latin
grammar
i
felt
keenly
for
the
poor
soul
and
though
i
was
under
no
delusion
as
to
the
assistance
i
got
in
my
latin
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
get
rid
of
him
this
pretence
of
learning
latin
lasted
as
long
as
i
was
at
these
lodgings
when
on
the
eve
of
leaving
them
i
offered
to
settle
his
dues
he
said
piteously
i
have
done
nothing
and
only
wasted
your
time
i
can
not
accept
any
payment
from
you
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
i
got
him
at
last
to
take
his
fees
though
my
latin
tutor
had
never
ventured
to
trouble
me
with
the
proofs
of
his
theory
yet
up
to
this
day
i
do
not
disbelieve
it
i
am
convinced
that
the
minds
of
men
are
connected
through
some
continuous
medium
and
that
a
disturbance
in
one
part
is
by
it
secretly
communicated
to
others
palit
next
placed
me
in
the
house
of
a
coach
named
barker
he
used
to
lodge
and
prepare
students
for
their
examinations
except
his
mild
little
wife
there
was
not
a
thing
with
any
pretensions
to
attractiveness
about
this
household
one
can
understand
how
such
a
tutor
can
get
pupils
for
these
poor
creatures
do
not
often
get
the
chance
of
making
a
choice
but
it
is
painful
to
think
of
the
conditions
under
which
such
men
get
wives
barker
had
attempted
to
console
herself
with
a
pet
dog
but
when
barker
wanted
to
punish
his
wife
he
tortured
the
dog
so
that
her
affection
for
the
unfortunate
animal
only
made
for
an
enlargement
of
her
field
of
sensibility
from
these
surroundings
when
my
sent
for
me
to
torquay
in
devonshire
i
was
only
too
glad
to
run
off
to
her
i
can
not
tell
how
happy
i
was
with
the
hills
there
the
sea
the
meadows
the
shade
of
the
pine
woods
and
my
two
little
restlessly
playful
companions
i
was
nevertheless
sometimes
tormented
with
questionings
as
to
why
when
my
eyes
were
so
surfeited
with
beauty
my
mind
saturated
with
joy
and
my
days
crossing
over
the
limitless
blue
of
space
freighted
with
unalloyed
happiness
there
should
be
no
call
of
poetry
to
me
so
one
day
off
i
went
along
the
rocky
shore
armed
with
book
and
umbrella
to
fulfil
my
poet
destiny
the
spot
i
selected
was
of
undoubted
beauty
for
that
did
not
depend
on
my
rhyme
or
fancy
there
was
a
flat
bit
of
overhanging
rock
reaching
out
as
with
a
perpetual
eagerness
over
the
waters
rocked
on
the
waves
of
the
liquid
blue
in
front
the
sunny
sky
slept
smilingly
to
its
lullaby
behind
the
shade
of
the
fringe
of
pines
lay
spread
like
the
slipped
off
garment
of
some
languorous
wood
nymph
enthroned
on
that
seat
of
stone
i
wrote
a
poem
the
sunken
boat
i
might
have
believed
that
it
was
good
had
i
taken
the
precaution
of
sinking
it
then
in
the
sea
but
such
consolation
is
not
open
to
me
for
it
happens
to
be
existing
in
the
body
and
though
banished
from
my
published
works
a
writ
might
yet
cause
it
to
be
produced
the
messenger
of
duty
however
was
not
idle
again
came
its
call
and
i
returned
to
london
this
time
i
found
a
refuge
in
the
household
of
scott
one
fine
evening
with
bag
and
baggage
i
invaded
his
home
only
the
white
haired
doctor
his
wife
and
their
eldest
daughter
were
there
the
two
younger
girls
alarmed
at
this
incursion
of
an
indian
stranger
had
gone
off
to
stay
with
a
relative
i
think
they
came
back
home
only
after
they
got
the
news
of
my
not
being
dangerous
in
a
very
short
time
i
became
like
one
of
the
family
scott
treated
me
as
a
son
and
the
heartfelt
kindness
i
got
from
her
daughters
is
rare
even
from
one
own
relations
one
thing
struck
me
when
living
in
this
family
that
human
nature
is
everywhere
the
same
we
are
fond
of
saying
and
i
also
believed
that
the
devotion
of
an
indian
wife
to
her
husband
is
something
unique
and
not
to
be
found
in
europe
but
i
at
least
was
unable
to
discern
any
difference
between
scott
and
an
ideal
indian
wife
she
was
entirely
wrapped
up
in
her
husband
with
their
modest
means
there
was
no
fussing
about
of
too
many
servants
and
scott
attended
to
every
detail
of
her
husband
wants
herself
before
he
came
back
home
from
his
work
of
an
evening
she
would
arrange
his
and
woollen
slippers
before
the
fire
with
her
own
hands
she
would
never
allow
herself
to
forget
for
a
moment
the
things
he
liked
or
the
behaviour
which
pleased
him
she
would
go
over
the
house
every
morning
with
their
only
maid
from
attic
to
kitchen
and
the
brass
rods
on
the
stairs
and
the
door
knobs
and
fittings
would
be
scrubbed
and
polished
till
they
shone
again
over
and
above
this
domestic
routine
there
were
the
many
calls
of
social
duty
after
getting
through
all
her
daily
duties
she
would
join
with
zest
in
our
evening
readings
and
music
for
it
is
not
the
least
of
the
duties
of
a
good
housewife
to
make
real
the
gaiety
of
the
leisure
hour
some
evenings
i
would
join
the
girls
in
a
seance
we
would
place
our
fingers
on
a
small
tea
table
and
it
would
go
capering
about
the
room
it
got
to
be
so
that
whatever
we
touched
began
to
quake
and
quiver
scott
did
not
quite
like
all
this
she
would
sometimes
gravely
shake
her
head
and
say
she
had
her
doubts
about
its
being
right
she
bore
it
bravely
however
not
liking
to
put
a
damper
on
our
youthful
spirits
but
one
day
when
we
put
our
hands
on
scott
chimneypot
to
make
it
turn
that
was
too
much
for
her
she
rushed
up
in
a
great
state
of
mind
and
forbade
us
to
touch
it
she
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
satan
having
anything
to
do
even
for
a
moment
with
her
husband
in
all
her
actions
her
reverence
for
her
husband
was
the
one
thing
that
stood
out
the
memory
of
her
sweet
makes
it
clear
to
me
that
the
ultimate
perfection
of
all
womanly
love
is
to
be
found
in
reverence
that
where
no
extraneous
cause
has
hampered
its
true
development
woman
love
naturally
grows
into
worship
where
the
appointments
of
luxury
are
in
profusion
and
frivolity
tarnishes
both
day
and
night
this
love
is
degraded
and
woman
nature
finds
not
the
joy
of
its
perfection
i
spent
some
months
here
then
it
was
time
for
my
brother
to
return
home
and
my
father
wrote
to
me
to
accompany
him
i
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
the
light
of
my
country
the
sky
of
my
country
had
been
silently
calling
me
when
i
said
good
bye
scott
took
me
by
the
hand
and
wept
why
did
you
come
to
us
she
said
if
you
must
go
so
soon
that
household
no
longer
exists
in
london
some
of
the
members
of
the
doctor
family
have
departed
to
the
other
world
others
are
scattered
in
places
unknown
to
me
but
it
will
always
live
in
my
memory
one
winter
day
as
i
was
passing
through
a
street
in
tunbridge
wells
i
saw
a
man
standing
on
the
road
side
his
bare
toes
were
showing
through
his
gaping
boots
his
breast
was
partly
uncovered
he
said
nothing
to
me
perhaps
because
begging
was
forbidden
but
he
looked
up
at
my
face
just
for
a
moment
the
coin
i
gave
him
was
perhaps
more
valuable
than
he
expected
for
after
i
had
gone
on
a
bit
he
came
after
me
and
said
sir
you
have
given
me
a
gold
piece
by
mistake
with
which
he
offered
to
return
it
to
me
i
might
not
have
particularly
remembered
this
but
for
a
similar
thing
which
happened
on
another
occasion
when
i
first
reached
the
torquay
railway
station
a
porter
took
my
luggage
to
the
cab
outside
after
searching
my
purse
for
small
change
in
vain
i
gave
him
as
the
cab
started
after
a
while
he
came
running
after
us
shouting
to
the
cabman
to
stop
i
thought
to
myself
that
finding
me
to
be
such
an
innocent
he
had
hit
upon
some
excuse
for
demanding
more
as
the
cab
stopped
he
said
you
must
have
mistaken
a
piece
for
a
penny
sir
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
never
been
cheated
while
in
england
but
not
in
any
way
which
it
would
be
fair
to
hold
in
remembrance
what
grew
chiefly
upon
me
rather
was
the
conviction
that
only
those
who
are
trustworthy
know
how
to
trust
i
was
an
unknown
foreigner
and
could
have
easily
evaded
payment
with
impunity
yet
no
london
shopkeeper
ever
mistrusted
me
during
the
whole
period
of
my
stay
in
england
i
was
mixed
up
in
a
farcical
comedy
which
i
had
to
play
out
from
start
to
finish
i
happened
to
get
acquainted
with
the
widow
of
some
departed
high
official
she
was
good
enough
to
call
me
by
the
ruby
some
indian
friend
of
hers
had
composed
a
doleful
poem
in
english
in
memory
of
her
husband
it
is
needless
to
expatiate
on
its
poetic
merit
or
felicity
of
diction
as
my
would
have
it
the
composer
had
indicated
that
the
dirge
was
to
be
chanted
to
the
mode
so
the
widow
one
day
entreated
me
to
sing
it
to
her
thus
like
the
silly
innocent
that
i
was
i
weakly
acceded
there
was
unfortunately
no
one
there
but
i
who
could
realise
the
atrociously
ludicrous
way
in
which
the
mode
combined
with
those
absurd
verses
the
widow
seemed
intensely
touched
to
hear
the
indian
lament
for
her
husband
sung
to
its
native
melody
i
thought
that
there
the
matter
ended
but
that
was
not
to
be
i
frequently
met
the
widowed
lady
at
different
social
gatherings
and
when
after
dinner
we
joined
the
ladies
in
the
drawing
room
she
would
ask
me
to
sing
that
everyone
else
would
anticipate
some
extraordinary
specimen
of
indian
music
and
would
add
their
entreaties
to
hers
then
from
her
pocket
would
come
forth
printed
copies
of
that
fateful
composition
and
my
ears
begin
to
redden
and
tingle
and
at
last
with
bowed
head
and
quavering
voice
i
would
have
to
make
a
beginning
but
too
keenly
conscious
that
to
none
else
in
the
room
but
me
was
this
performance
sufficiently
heartrending
at
the
end
amidst
much
suppressed
tittering
there
would
come
a
chorus
of
thank
you
very
much
how
interesting
and
in
spite
of
its
being
winter
i
would
perspire
all
over
who
would
have
predicted
at
my
birth
or
at
his
death
what
a
severe
blow
to
me
would
be
the
demise
of
this
estimable
then
for
a
time
while
i
was
living
with
scott
and
attending
lectures
at
the
university
college
i
lost
touch
with
the
widow
she
was
in
a
suburban
locality
some
distance
away
from
london
and
i
frequently
got
letters
from
her
inviting
me
there
but
my
dread
of
that
dirge
kept
me
from
accepting
these
invitations
at
length
i
got
a
pressing
telegram
from
her
i
was
on
my
way
to
college
when
this
telegram
reached
me
and
my
stay
in
england
was
then
about
to
come
to
its
close
i
thought
to
myself
i
ought
to
see
the
widow
once
more
before
my
departure
and
so
yielded
to
her
importunity
instead
of
coming
home
from
college
i
went
straight
to
the
railway
station
it
was
a
horrible
day
bitterly
cold
snowing
and
foggy
the
station
i
was
bound
for
was
the
terminus
of
the
line
so
i
felt
quite
easy
in
mind
and
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
inquire
about
the
time
of
arrival
all
the
station
platforms
were
coming
on
the
right
hand
side
and
in
the
right
hand
corner
seat
i
had
ensconced
myself
reading
a
book
it
had
already
become
so
dark
that
nothing
was
visible
outside
one
by
one
the
other
passengers
got
down
at
their
destinations
we
reached
and
left
the
station
just
before
the
last
one
then
the
train
stopped
again
but
there
was
nobody
to
be
seen
nor
any
lights
or
platform
the
mere
passenger
has
no
means
of
divining
why
trains
should
sometimes
stop
at
the
wrong
times
and
places
so
giving
up
the
attempt
i
went
on
with
my
reading
then
the
train
began
to
move
backwards
there
seems
to
be
no
accounting
for
railway
eccentricity
thought
i
as
i
once
more
returned
to
my
book
but
when
we
came
right
back
to
the
previous
station
i
could
remain
indifferent
no
longer
when
are
we
getting
to
i
inquired
at
the
station
you
are
just
coming
from
there
was
the
reply
where
are
we
going
now
then
i
asked
thoroughly
flurried
to
london
i
thereupon
understood
that
this
was
a
shuttle
train
on
inquiring
about
the
next
train
to
i
was
informed
that
there
were
no
more
trains
that
night
and
in
reply
to
my
next
question
i
gathered
that
there
was
no
inn
within
five
miles
i
had
left
home
after
breakfast
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
had
had
nothing
since
when
abstinence
is
the
only
choice
an
ascetic
frame
of
mind
comes
easy
i
buttoned
up
my
thick
overcoat
to
the
neck
and
seating
myself
under
a
platform
lamp
went
on
with
my
reading
the
book
i
had
with
me
was
spencer
of
then
recently
published
i
consoled
myself
with
the
thought
that
i
might
never
get
another
such
opportunity
of
concentrating
my
whole
attention
on
such
a
subject
after
a
short
time
a
porter
came
and
informed
me
that
a
special
was
running
and
would
be
in
in
half
an
hour
i
felt
so
cheered
up
by
the
news
that
i
could
not
go
on
any
longer
with
the
of
where
i
was
due
at
seven
i
arrived
at
length
at
nine
what
is
this
ruby
asked
my
hostess
whatever
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
i
was
unable
to
take
much
pride
in
the
account
of
my
wonderful
adventures
which
i
gave
her
dinner
was
over
nevertheless
as
my
misfortune
was
hardly
my
fault
i
did
not
expect
condign
punishment
especially
as
the
dispenser
was
a
woman
but
all
that
the
widow
of
the
high
official
said
to
me
was
come
along
ruby
have
a
cup
of
tea
i
never
was
a
but
in
the
hope
that
it
might
be
of
some
assistance
in
allaying
my
consuming
hunger
i
managed
to
swallow
a
cup
of
strong
decoction
with
a
couple
of
dry
biscuits
when
i
at
length
reached
the
drawing
room
i
found
a
gathering
of
elderly
ladies
and
among
them
one
pretty
young
american
who
was
engaged
to
a
nephew
of
my
hostess
and
seemed
busy
going
through
the
usual
premarital
love
passages
let
have
some
dancing
said
my
hostess
i
was
neither
in
the
mood
nor
bodily
condition
for
that
exercise
but
it
is
the
docile
who
achieve
the
most
impossible
things
in
this
world
so
though
the
dance
was
primarily
got
up
for
the
benefit
of
the
engaged
couple
i
had
to
dance
with
the
ladies
of
considerably
advanced
age
with
only
the
tea
and
biscuits
between
myself
and
starvation
but
my
sorrows
did
not
end
here
where
are
you
putting
up
for
the
night
asked
my
hostess
this
was
a
question
for
which
i
was
not
prepared
while
i
stared
at
her
speechless
she
explained
that
as
the
local
inn
would
close
at
midnight
i
had
better
betake
myself
thither
without
further
delay
hospitality
however
was
not
entirely
wanting
for
i
had
not
to
find
the
inn
unaided
a
servant
showing
me
the
way
there
with
a
lantern
at
first
i
thought
this
might
prove
a
blessing
in
disguise
and
at
once
proceeded
to
make
inquiries
for
food
flesh
fish
or
vegetable
hot
or
cold
anything
i
was
told
that
drinks
i
could
have
in
any
variety
but
nothing
to
eat
then
i
looked
to
slumber
for
forgetfulness
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
room
even
in
her
lap
the
floor
of
the
was
icy
cold
an
old
bedstead
and
being
its
only
furniture
in
the
morning
the
widow
sent
for
me
to
breakfast
i
found
a
cold
repast
spread
out
evidently
the
remnants
of
last
night
dinner
a
small
portion
of
this
lukewarm
or
cold
offered
to
me
last
night
could
not
have
hurt
anyone
while
my
dancing
might
then
have
been
less
like
the
agonised
wrigglings
of
a
landed
carp
after
breakfast
my
hostess
informed
me
that
the
lady
for
whose
delectation
i
had
been
invited
to
sing
was
ill
in
bed
and
that
i
would
have
to
serenade
her
from
her
door
i
was
made
to
stand
up
on
the
staircase
landing
pointing
to
a
closed
door
the
widow
said
where
she
is
and
i
gave
voice
to
that
dirge
facing
the
mysterious
unknown
on
the
other
side
of
what
happened
to
the
invalid
as
the
result
i
have
yet
received
no
news
after
my
return
to
london
i
had
to
expiate
in
bed
the
consequences
of
my
fatuous
complaisance
scott
girls
implored
me
on
my
conscience
not
to
take
this
as
a
sample
of
english
hospitality
it
was
the
effect
of
india
salt
they
protested
while
i
was
attending
lectures
on
english
literature
at
the
university
college
loken
palit
was
my
class
fellow
he
was
about
years
younger
than
i
at
the
age
i
am
writing
these
reminiscences
a
difference
of
years
is
not
perceptible
but
it
is
difficult
for
friendship
to
bridge
the
gulf
between
and
lacking
the
weight
of
years
the
boy
is
always
anxious
to
keep
up
the
dignity
of
seniority
but
this
did
not
raise
any
barrier
in
my
mind
in
the
case
of
the
boy
loken
for
i
could
not
feel
that
he
was
in
any
way
my
junior
boy
and
girl
students
sat
together
in
the
college
library
for
study
this
was
the
place
for
our
had
we
been
fairly
quiet
about
it
none
need
have
complained
but
my
young
friend
was
so
surcharged
with
high
spirits
that
at
the
least
provocation
they
would
burst
forth
as
laughter
in
all
countries
girls
have
a
perverse
degree
of
application
to
their
studies
and
i
feel
repentant
as
i
recall
the
multitude
of
reproachful
blue
eyes
which
vainly
showered
disapprobation
on
our
unrestrained
merriment
but
in
those
days
i
felt
not
the
slightest
sympathy
with
the
distress
of
disturbed
studiousness
by
the
grace
of
providence
i
have
never
had
a
headache
in
my
life
nor
a
moment
of
compunction
for
interrupted
school
studies
with
our
laughter
as
an
almost
unbroken
accompaniment
we
managed
also
to
do
a
bit
of
literary
discussion
and
though
loken
reading
of
bengali
literature
was
less
extensive
than
mine
he
made
up
for
that
by
the
keenness
of
his
intellect
among
the
subjects
we
discussed
was
bengali
orthography
the
way
it
arose
was
this
one
of
the
scott
girls
wanted
me
to
teach
her
bengali
when
taking
her
through
the
alphabet
i
expressed
my
pride
that
bengali
spelling
has
a
conscience
and
does
not
delight
in
overstepping
rules
at
every
step
i
made
clear
to
her
how
laughable
would
have
been
the
waywardness
of
english
spelling
but
for
the
tragic
compulsion
we
were
under
to
cram
it
for
our
examinations
but
my
pride
had
a
fall
it
transpired
that
bengali
spelling
was
quite
as
impatient
of
bondage
but
that
habit
had
blinded
me
to
its
transgressions
then
i
began
to
search
for
the
laws
regulating
its
lawlessness
i
was
quite
surprised
at
the
wonderful
assistance
which
loken
proved
to
be
in
this
matter
after
loken
had
got
into
the
indian
civil
service
and
returned
home
the
work
which
had
in
the
university
college
library
had
its
source
in
rippling
merriment
flowed
on
in
a
widening
stream
loken
boisterous
delight
in
literature
was
as
the
wind
in
the
sails
of
my
literary
adventure
and
when
at
the
height
of
my
youth
i
was
driving
the
tandem
of
prose
and
poetry
at
a
furious
rate
loken
unstinted
appreciation
kept
my
energies
from
flagging
for
a
moment
many
an
extraordinary
prose
or
poetical
flight
have
i
taken
in
his
bungalow
in
the
moffussil
on
many
an
occasion
did
our
literary
and
musical
gatherings
assemble
under
the
auspices
of
the
evening
star
to
disperse
as
did
the
lamplights
at
the
breezes
of
dawn
under
the
morning
star
of
the
many
lotus
flowers
at
feet
the
blossom
of
friendship
must
be
her
favorite
i
have
not
come
across
much
of
golden
pollen
in
her
lotus
bank
but
have
nothing
to
complain
of
as
regards
the
profusion
of
the
sweet
savour
of
broken
while
in
england
i
began
another
poem
which
i
went
on
with
during
my
journey
home
and
finished
after
my
return
this
was
published
under
the
name
of
the
broken
heart
at
the
time
i
thought
it
very
good
there
was
nothing
strange
in
the
writer
thinking
so
but
it
did
not
fail
to
gain
the
appreciation
of
the
readers
of
the
time
as
well
i
remember
how
after
it
came
out
the
chief
minister
of
the
late
raja
of
tipperah
called
on
me
solely
to
deliver
the
message
that
the
raja
admired
the
poem
and
entertained
high
hopes
of
the
writer
future
literary
career
about
this
poem
of
my
eighteenth
year
let
me
set
down
here
what
i
wrote
in
a
letter
when
i
was
thirty
when
i
began
to
write
the
i
was
eighteen
neither
in
my
childhood
nor
my
youth
this
borderland
age
is
not
illumined
with
the
direct
rays
of
truth
its
reflection
is
seen
here
and
there
and
the
rest
is
shadow
and
like
twilight
shades
its
imaginings
are
and
vague
making
the
real
world
seem
like
a
world
of
phantasy
the
curious
part
of
it
is
that
not
only
was
i
eighteen
but
everyone
around
me
seemed
to
be
eighteen
likewise
and
we
all
flitted
about
in
the
same
baseless
substanceless
world
of
imagination
where
even
the
most
intense
joys
and
sorrows
seemed
like
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
dreamland
there
being
nothing
real
to
weigh
them
against
the
trivial
did
duty
for
the
great
this
period
of
my
life
from
the
age
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
to
or
was
one
of
utter
disorderliness
when
in
the
early
ages
of
the
earth
land
and
water
had
not
yet
distinctly
separated
huge
misshapen
amphibious
creatures
walked
the
forests
growing
on
the
oozing
silt
thus
do
the
passions
of
the
dim
ages
of
the
immature
mind
as
disproportionate
and
curiously
shaped
haunt
the
unending
shades
of
its
trackless
nameless
wildernesses
they
know
not
themselves
nor
the
aim
of
their
wanderings
and
because
they
do
not
they
are
ever
apt
to
imitate
something
else
so
at
this
age
of
unmeaning
activity
when
my
undeveloped
powers
unaware
of
and
unequal
to
their
object
were
jostling
each
other
for
an
outlet
each
sought
to
assert
superiority
through
exaggeration
when
are
trying
to
push
their
way
through
they
work
the
infant
into
a
fever
all
this
agitation
finds
no
justification
till
the
teeth
are
out
and
have
begun
assisting
in
the
absorption
of
food
in
the
same
way
do
our
early
passions
torment
the
mind
like
a
malady
till
they
realise
their
true
relationship
with
the
outer
world
the
lessons
i
learnt
from
my
experiences
at
that
stage
are
to
be
found
in
every
moral
but
are
not
therefore
to
be
despised
that
which
keeps
our
appetites
confined
within
us
and
checks
their
free
access
to
the
outside
poisons
our
life
such
is
selfishness
which
refuses
to
give
free
play
to
our
desires
and
prevents
them
from
reaching
their
real
goal
and
that
is
why
it
is
always
accompanied
by
festering
untruths
and
extravagances
when
our
desires
find
unlimited
freedom
in
good
work
they
shake
off
their
diseased
condition
and
come
back
to
their
own
nature
that
is
their
true
end
there
also
is
the
joy
of
their
being
the
condition
of
my
immature
mind
which
i
have
described
was
fostered
both
by
the
example
and
precept
of
the
time
and
i
am
not
sure
that
the
effects
of
these
are
not
lingering
on
to
the
present
day
glancing
back
at
the
period
of
which
i
tell
it
strikes
me
that
we
had
gained
more
of
stimulation
than
of
nourishment
out
of
english
literature
our
literary
gods
then
were
shakespeare
milton
and
byron
and
the
quality
in
their
work
which
stirred
us
most
was
strength
of
passion
in
the
social
life
of
englishmen
passionate
outbursts
are
kept
severely
in
check
for
which
very
reason
perhaps
they
so
dominate
their
literature
making
its
characteristic
to
be
the
working
out
of
extravagantly
vehement
feelings
to
an
inevitable
conflagration
at
least
this
uncontrolled
excitement
was
what
we
learnt
to
look
on
as
the
quintessence
of
english
literature
illustration
moonlight
in
the
impetuous
declamation
of
english
poetry
by
akshay
chowdhury
our
initiator
into
english
literature
there
was
the
wildness
of
intoxication
the
frenzy
of
romeo
and
juliet
love
the
fury
of
king
lear
impotent
lamentation
the
fire
of
jealousy
these
were
the
things
that
roused
us
to
enthusiastic
admiration
our
restricted
social
life
our
narrower
field
of
activity
was
hedged
in
with
such
monotonous
uniformity
that
tempestuous
feelings
found
no
entrance
all
was
as
calm
and
quiet
as
could
be
so
our
hearts
naturally
craved
the
shock
of
the
passionate
emotion
in
english
literature
ours
was
not
the
æsthetic
enjoyment
of
literary
art
but
the
jubilant
welcome
by
stagnation
of
a
turbulent
wave
even
though
it
should
stir
up
to
the
surface
the
slime
of
the
bottom
shakespeare
contemporary
literature
represents
the
of
the
day
when
the
renascence
came
to
europe
in
all
the
violence
of
its
reaction
against
the
severe
curbing
and
cramping
of
the
hearts
of
men
the
examination
of
good
and
evil
beauty
and
ugliness
was
not
the
main
object
man
then
seemed
consumed
with
the
anxiety
to
break
through
all
barriers
to
the
inmost
sanctuary
of
his
being
there
to
discover
the
ultimate
image
of
his
own
violent
desire
that
is
why
in
this
literature
we
find
such
poignant
such
exuberant
such
unbridled
expression
the
spirit
of
this
bacchanalian
revelry
of
europe
found
entrance
into
our
demurely
social
world
woke
us
up
and
made
us
lively
we
were
dazzled
by
the
glow
of
unfettered
life
which
fell
upon
our
heart
pining
for
an
opportunity
to
disclose
itself
there
was
another
such
day
in
english
literature
when
the
of
pope
common
time
gave
place
to
the
of
the
french
revolution
this
had
byron
for
its
poet
and
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
also
moved
our
veiled
in
the
seclusion
of
her
corner
in
this
wise
did
the
excitement
of
the
pursuit
of
english
literature
come
to
sway
the
heart
of
the
youth
of
our
time
and
at
mine
the
waves
of
this
excitement
kept
beating
from
every
side
the
first
awakening
is
the
time
for
the
play
of
energy
not
its
repression
and
yet
our
case
was
so
different
from
that
of
europe
there
the
excitability
and
impatience
of
bondage
was
a
reflection
from
its
history
into
its
literature
its
expression
was
consistent
with
its
feeling
the
roaring
of
the
storm
was
heard
because
a
storm
was
really
raging
the
breeze
therefrom
that
ruffled
our
little
world
sounded
in
reality
but
little
above
a
murmur
therein
it
failed
to
satisfy
our
minds
so
that
our
attempts
to
imitate
the
blast
of
a
hurricane
led
us
easily
into
exaggeration
a
tendency
which
still
persists
and
may
not
prove
easy
of
cure
and
for
this
the
fact
that
in
english
literature
the
reticence
of
true
art
has
not
yet
appeared
is
responsible
human
emotion
is
only
one
of
the
ingredients
of
literature
and
not
its
end
which
is
the
beauty
of
perfect
fulness
consisting
in
simplicity
and
restraint
this
is
a
proposition
which
english
literature
does
not
yet
fully
admit
our
minds
from
infancy
to
old
age
are
being
moulded
by
this
english
literature
alone
but
other
literatures
of
europe
both
classical
and
modern
of
which
the
shows
the
development
due
to
a
systematic
cultivation
of
are
not
subjects
of
our
study
and
so
as
it
seems
to
me
we
are
yet
unable
to
arrive
at
a
correct
perception
of
the
true
aim
and
method
of
literary
work
akshay
babu
who
had
made
the
passion
in
english
literature
living
to
us
was
himself
a
votary
of
the
emotional
life
the
importance
of
realising
truth
in
the
fulness
of
its
perfection
seemed
less
apparent
to
him
than
that
of
feeling
it
in
the
heart
he
had
no
intellectual
respect
for
religion
but
songs
of
m
the
dark
mother
would
bring
tears
to
his
eyes
he
felt
no
call
to
search
for
ultimate
reality
whatever
moved
his
heart
served
him
for
the
time
as
the
truth
even
obvious
coarseness
not
proving
a
deterrent
atheism
was
the
dominant
note
of
the
english
prose
writings
then
in
vogue
bentham
mill
and
comte
being
favourite
authors
theirs
was
the
reasoning
in
terms
of
which
our
youths
argued
the
age
of
mill
constitutes
a
natural
epoch
in
english
history
it
represents
a
healthy
reaction
of
the
body
politic
these
destructive
forces
having
been
brought
in
temporarily
to
rid
it
of
accumulated
in
our
country
we
received
these
in
the
letter
but
never
sought
to
make
practical
use
of
them
employing
them
only
as
a
stimulant
to
incite
ourselves
to
moral
revolt
atheism
was
thus
for
us
a
mere
intoxication
for
these
reasons
educated
men
then
fell
mainly
into
two
classes
one
class
would
be
always
thrusting
themselves
forward
with
unprovoked
argumentation
to
cut
to
pieces
all
belief
in
god
like
the
hunter
whose
hands
itch
no
sooner
he
spies
a
living
creature
on
the
top
or
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
to
kill
it
whenever
these
came
to
learn
of
a
harmless
belief
lurking
anywhere
in
fancied
security
they
felt
stirred
up
to
sally
forth
and
demolish
it
we
had
for
a
short
time
a
tutor
of
whom
this
was
a
pet
diversion
though
i
was
a
mere
boy
even
i
could
not
escape
his
onslaughts
not
that
his
attainments
were
of
any
account
or
that
his
opinions
were
the
result
of
any
enthusiastic
search
for
the
truth
being
mostly
gathered
from
others
lips
but
though
i
fought
him
with
all
my
strength
unequally
matched
in
age
as
we
were
i
suffered
many
a
bitter
defeat
sometimes
i
felt
so
mortified
i
almost
wanted
to
cry
the
other
class
consisted
not
of
believers
but
religious
epicureans
who
found
comfort
and
solace
in
gathering
together
and
steeping
themselves
in
pleasing
sights
sounds
and
scents
galore
under
the
garb
of
religious
ceremonial
they
luxuriated
in
the
paraphernalia
of
worship
in
neither
of
these
classes
was
doubt
or
denial
the
outcome
of
the
travail
of
their
quest
though
these
religious
aberrations
pained
me
i
can
not
say
i
was
not
at
all
influenced
by
them
with
the
intellectual
impudence
of
budding
youth
this
revolt
also
found
a
place
the
religious
services
which
were
held
in
our
family
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
i
had
not
accepted
them
for
my
own
i
was
busy
blowing
up
a
raging
flame
with
the
bellows
of
my
emotions
it
was
only
the
worship
of
fire
the
giving
of
oblations
to
increase
its
flame
with
no
other
aim
and
because
my
endeavour
had
no
end
in
view
it
was
measureless
always
reaching
beyond
any
assigned
limit
as
with
religion
so
with
my
emotions
i
felt
no
need
for
any
underlying
truth
my
excitement
being
an
end
in
itself
i
call
to
mind
some
lines
of
a
poet
of
that
time
my
heart
is
mine
i
have
sold
it
to
none
be
it
tattered
and
torn
and
worn
away
my
heart
is
mine
from
the
standpoint
of
truth
the
heart
need
not
worry
itself
so
for
nothing
compels
it
to
wear
itself
to
tatters
in
truth
sorrow
is
not
desirable
but
taken
apart
its
pungency
may
appear
savoury
this
savour
our
poets
often
made
much
of
leaving
out
the
god
in
whose
worship
they
were
indulging
this
childishness
our
country
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
so
even
when
we
fail
to
see
the
truth
of
religion
we
seek
in
its
observance
an
artistic
gratification
so
also
much
of
our
patriotism
is
not
service
of
the
but
the
luxury
of
bringing
ourselves
into
a
desirable
attitude
of
mind
toward
the
country
part
vi
when
i
was
in
brighton
i
once
went
to
hear
some
prima
donna
i
forget
her
name
it
may
have
been
madame
neilson
or
madame
albani
never
before
had
i
come
across
such
an
extraordinary
command
over
the
voice
even
our
best
singers
can
not
hide
their
sense
of
effort
nor
are
they
ashamed
to
bring
out
as
best
they
can
top
notes
or
bass
notes
beyond
their
proper
register
in
our
country
the
understanding
portion
of
the
audience
think
no
harm
in
keeping
the
performance
up
to
standard
by
dint
of
their
own
imagination
for
the
same
reason
they
do
not
mind
any
harshness
of
voice
or
uncouthness
of
gesture
in
the
exponent
of
a
perfectly
formed
melody
on
the
contrary
they
seem
sometimes
to
be
of
opinion
that
such
minor
external
defects
serve
better
to
set
off
the
internal
perfection
of
the
composition
as
with
the
outward
poverty
of
the
great
ascetic
mahadeva
whose
divinity
shines
forth
naked
this
feeling
seems
entirely
wanting
in
europe
there
outward
embellishment
must
be
perfect
in
every
detail
and
the
least
defect
stands
shamed
and
unable
to
face
the
public
gaze
in
our
musical
gatherings
nothing
is
thought
of
spending
in
tuning
up
the
or
hammering
into
tone
the
drums
little
and
big
in
europe
such
duties
are
performed
beforehand
behind
the
scenes
for
all
that
comes
in
front
must
be
faultless
there
is
thus
no
room
for
any
weak
spot
in
the
singer
voice
in
our
country
a
correct
and
artistic
exposition
of
the
melody
is
the
main
object
thereon
is
concentrated
all
the
effort
in
europe
the
voice
is
the
object
of
culture
and
with
it
they
perform
impossibilities
in
our
country
the
virtuoso
is
satisfied
if
he
has
heard
the
song
in
europe
they
go
to
hear
the
singer
that
is
what
i
saw
that
day
in
brighton
to
me
it
was
as
good
as
a
circus
but
admire
the
performance
as
i
did
i
could
not
appreciate
the
song
i
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
when
some
of
the
imitated
the
warbling
of
birds
i
felt
all
the
time
that
it
was
a
misapplication
of
the
human
voice
when
it
came
to
the
turn
of
a
male
singer
i
was
considerably
relieved
i
specially
liked
the
tenor
voices
which
had
more
of
human
flesh
and
blood
in
them
and
seemed
less
like
the
disembodied
lament
of
a
forlorn
spirit
after
this
as
i
went
on
hearing
and
learning
more
and
more
of
european
music
i
began
to
get
into
the
spirit
of
it
but
up
to
now
i
am
convinced
that
our
music
and
theirs
abide
in
altogether
different
apartments
and
do
not
gain
entry
to
the
heart
by
the
door
european
music
seems
to
be
intertwined
with
its
material
life
so
that
the
text
of
its
songs
may
be
as
various
as
that
life
itself
if
we
attempt
to
put
our
tunes
to
the
same
variety
of
use
they
tend
to
lose
their
significance
and
become
ludicrous
for
our
melodies
transcend
the
barriers
of
everyday
life
and
only
thus
can
they
carry
us
so
deep
into
pity
so
high
into
aloofness
their
function
being
to
reveal
a
picture
of
the
inmost
inexpressible
depths
of
our
being
mysterious
and
impenetrable
where
the
devotee
may
find
his
hermitage
ready
or
even
the
epicurean
his
bower
but
where
there
is
no
room
for
the
busy
man
of
the
world
i
can
not
claim
that
i
gained
admittance
to
the
soul
of
european
music
but
what
little
of
it
i
came
to
understand
from
the
outside
attracted
me
greatly
in
one
way
it
seemed
to
me
so
romantic
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
analyse
what
i
mean
by
that
word
what
i
would
refer
to
is
the
aspect
of
variety
of
abundance
of
the
waves
on
the
sea
of
life
of
the
light
and
shade
on
their
ceaseless
undulations
there
is
the
opposite
aspect
of
pure
extension
of
the
unwinking
blue
of
the
sky
of
the
silent
hint
of
immeasureability
in
the
distant
circle
of
the
horizon
however
that
may
be
let
me
repeat
at
the
risk
of
not
being
perfectly
clear
that
whenever
i
have
been
moved
by
european
music
i
have
said
to
myself
it
is
romantic
it
is
translating
into
melody
the
evanescence
of
life
not
that
we
wholly
lack
the
same
attempt
in
some
forms
of
our
music
but
it
is
less
pronounced
less
successful
our
melodies
give
voice
to
the
night
to
the
first
reddening
of
dawn
they
speak
of
the
sorrow
which
lowers
in
the
darkness
of
clouds
the
speechless
deep
intoxication
of
the
spring
we
had
a
profusely
decorated
volume
of
moore
irish
melodies
and
often
have
i
listened
to
the
enraptured
recitation
of
these
by
akshay
babu
the
poems
combined
with
the
pictorial
designs
to
conjure
up
for
me
a
dream
picture
of
the
ireland
of
old
i
had
not
then
actually
heard
the
original
tunes
but
had
sung
these
irish
melodies
to
myself
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
harps
in
the
pictures
i
longed
to
hear
the
real
tunes
to
learn
them
and
sing
them
to
akshay
babu
some
longings
unfortunately
do
get
fulfilled
in
this
life
and
die
in
the
process
when
i
went
to
england
i
did
hear
some
of
the
irish
melodies
sung
and
learnt
them
too
but
that
put
an
end
to
my
keenness
to
learn
more
they
were
simple
mournful
and
sweet
but
they
somehow
did
not
fit
in
with
the
silent
melody
of
the
harp
which
filled
the
halls
of
the
old
ireland
of
my
dreams
when
i
came
back
home
i
sung
the
irish
melodies
i
had
learnt
to
my
people
what
is
the
matter
with
rabi
voice
they
exclaimed
how
funny
and
foreign
it
sounds
they
even
felt
my
speaking
voice
had
changed
its
tone
from
this
mixed
cultivation
of
foreign
and
native
melody
was
born
the
the
tunes
in
this
musical
drama
are
mostly
indian
but
they
have
been
dragged
out
of
their
classic
dignity
that
which
soared
in
the
sky
was
taught
to
run
on
the
earth
those
who
have
seen
and
heard
it
performed
will
i
trust
bear
witness
that
the
harnessing
of
indian
melodic
modes
to
the
service
of
the
drama
has
proved
neither
derogatory
nor
futile
this
conjunction
is
the
only
special
feature
of
the
pleasing
task
of
loosening
the
chains
of
melodic
forms
and
making
them
adaptable
to
a
variety
of
treatment
completely
engrossed
me
several
of
the
songs
of
were
set
to
tunes
originally
severely
classic
in
mode
some
of
the
tunes
were
composed
by
my
brother
jyotirindra
a
few
were
adapted
from
european
sources
the
style
of
indian
modes
specially
lends
itself
to
dramatic
purposes
and
has
been
frequently
utilized
in
this
work
two
english
tunes
served
for
the
drinking
songs
of
the
robber
band
and
an
irish
melody
for
the
lament
of
the
wood
nymphs
is
not
a
composition
which
will
bear
being
read
its
significance
is
lost
if
it
is
not
heard
sung
and
seen
acted
it
is
not
what
europeans
call
an
opera
but
a
little
drama
set
to
music
that
is
to
say
it
is
not
primarily
a
musical
composition
very
few
of
the
songs
are
important
or
attractive
by
themselves
they
all
serve
merely
as
the
musical
text
of
the
play
before
i
went
to
england
we
occasionally
used
to
have
gatherings
of
literary
men
in
our
house
at
which
music
recitations
and
light
refreshments
were
served
up
after
my
return
one
more
such
gathering
was
held
which
happened
to
be
the
last
it
was
for
an
entertainment
in
this
connection
that
the
was
composed
i
played
and
my
niece
pratibha
took
the
part
of
which
bit
of
history
remains
recorded
in
the
name
i
had
read
in
some
work
of
herbert
spencer
that
speech
takes
on
tuneful
inflexions
whenever
emotion
comes
into
play
it
is
a
fact
that
the
tone
or
tune
is
as
important
to
us
as
the
spoken
word
for
the
expression
of
anger
sorrow
joy
and
wonder
spencer
idea
that
through
a
development
of
these
emotional
modulations
of
voice
man
found
music
appealed
to
me
why
should
it
not
do
i
thought
to
myself
to
act
a
drama
in
a
kind
of
recitative
based
on
this
idea
the
of
our
country
attempt
this
to
some
extent
for
they
frequently
break
into
a
chant
which
however
stops
short
of
full
melodic
form
as
blank
verse
is
more
elastic
than
rhymed
so
such
chanting
though
not
devoid
of
rhythm
can
more
freely
adapt
itself
to
the
emotional
interpretation
of
the
text
because
it
does
not
attempt
to
conform
to
the
more
rigorous
canons
of
tune
and
time
required
by
a
regular
melodic
composition
the
expression
of
feeling
being
the
object
these
deficiencies
in
regard
to
form
do
not
jar
on
the
hearer
encouraged
by
the
success
of
this
new
line
taken
in
the
i
composed
another
musical
play
of
the
same
class
it
was
called
the
the
fateful
hunt
the
plot
was
based
on
the
story
of
the
accidental
killing
of
the
blind
hermit
only
son
by
king
dasaratha
it
was
played
on
a
stage
erected
on
our
and
the
audience
seemed
profoundly
moved
by
its
pathos
afterwards
much
of
it
was
with
slight
changes
incorporated
in
the
and
this
play
ceased
to
be
separately
published
in
my
works
long
afterwards
i
composed
a
third
musical
play
the
play
of
an
operetta
of
a
different
type
in
this
the
songs
were
important
not
the
drama
in
the
others
a
series
of
dramatic
situations
were
strung
on
a
thread
of
melody
this
was
a
garland
of
songs
with
just
a
thread
of
dramatic
plot
running
through
the
play
of
feeling
and
not
action
was
its
special
feature
in
point
of
fact
i
was
while
composing
it
saturated
with
the
mood
of
song
the
enthusiasm
which
went
to
the
making
of
and
i
have
never
felt
for
any
other
work
of
mine
in
these
two
the
creative
musical
impulse
of
the
time
found
expression
my
brother
jyotirindra
was
engaged
the
day
at
his
piano
refashioning
the
classic
melodic
forms
at
his
pleasure
and
at
every
turn
of
his
instrument
the
old
modes
took
on
shapes
and
expressed
new
shades
of
feeling
the
melodic
forms
which
had
become
habituated
to
their
pristine
stately
gait
when
thus
compelled
to
march
to
more
lively
unconventional
measures
displayed
an
unexpected
agility
and
power
and
moved
us
correspondingly
we
could
plainly
hear
the
tunes
speak
to
us
while
akshay
babu
and
i
sat
on
either
side
fitting
words
to
them
as
they
grew
out
of
my
brother
nimble
fingers
i
do
not
claim
that
our
was
good
poetry
but
it
served
as
a
vehicle
for
the
tunes
in
the
riotous
joy
of
this
revolutionary
activity
were
these
two
musical
plays
composed
and
so
they
danced
merrily
to
every
measure
whether
or
not
technically
correct
indifferent
as
to
the
tunes
being
homelike
or
foreign
on
many
an
occasion
has
the
bengali
reading
public
been
grievously
exercised
over
some
opinion
or
literary
form
of
mine
but
it
is
curious
to
find
that
the
daring
with
which
i
had
played
havoc
with
accepted
musical
notions
did
not
rouse
any
resentment
on
the
contrary
those
who
came
to
hear
departed
pleased
a
few
of
akshay
babu
compositions
find
place
in
the
and
also
adaptations
from
vihari
chakravarti
series
of
songs
i
used
to
take
the
leading
part
in
the
performance
of
these
musical
dramas
from
my
early
years
i
had
a
taste
for
acting
and
firmly
believed
that
i
had
a
special
aptitude
for
it
i
think
i
proved
that
my
belief
was
not
i
had
only
once
before
done
the
part
of
aleek
babu
in
a
farce
written
by
my
brother
jyotirindra
so
these
were
really
my
first
attempts
at
acting
i
was
then
very
young
and
nothing
seemed
to
fatigue
or
trouble
my
voice
in
our
house
at
the
time
a
cascade
of
musical
emotion
was
gushing
forth
day
after
day
hour
after
hour
its
scattered
spray
reflecting
into
our
being
a
whole
gamut
of
rainbow
colours
then
with
the
freshness
of
youth
our
energy
impelled
by
its
virgin
curiosity
struck
out
new
paths
in
every
direction
we
felt
we
would
try
and
test
everything
and
no
achievement
seemed
impossible
we
wrote
we
sang
we
acted
we
poured
ourselves
out
on
every
side
this
was
how
i
stepped
into
my
twentieth
year
of
these
forces
which
so
triumphantly
raced
our
lives
along
my
brother
jyotirindra
was
the
charioteer
he
was
absolutely
fearless
once
when
i
was
a
mere
lad
and
had
never
ridden
a
horse
before
he
made
me
mount
one
and
gallop
by
his
side
with
no
qualms
about
his
unskilled
companion
when
at
the
same
age
while
we
were
at
shelidah
the
of
our
estate
news
was
brought
of
a
tiger
he
took
me
with
him
on
a
hunting
expedition
i
had
no
gun
it
would
have
been
more
dangerous
to
me
than
to
the
tiger
if
i
had
we
left
our
shoes
at
the
outskirts
of
the
jungle
and
crept
in
with
bare
feet
at
last
we
scrambled
up
into
a
bamboo
thicket
partly
stripped
of
its
twigs
where
i
somehow
managed
to
crouch
behind
my
brother
till
the
deed
was
done
with
no
means
of
even
administering
a
to
the
unmannerly
brute
had
he
dared
lay
his
offensive
paws
on
me
thus
did
my
brother
give
me
full
freedom
both
internal
and
external
in
the
face
of
all
dangers
no
usage
or
custom
was
a
bondage
for
him
and
so
was
he
able
to
rid
me
of
my
shrinking
diffidence
in
the
state
of
being
confined
within
myself
of
which
i
have
been
telling
i
wrote
a
number
of
poems
which
have
been
grouped
together
under
the
title
of
the
in
mohita
babu
edition
of
my
works
in
one
of
the
poems
subsequently
published
in
a
volume
called
the
following
lines
occur
there
is
a
vast
wilderness
whose
name
is
whose
interlacing
forest
branches
dandle
and
rock
darkness
like
an
infant
i
lost
my
way
in
its
depths
from
which
came
the
idea
of
the
name
for
this
group
of
poems
much
of
what
i
wrote
when
thus
my
life
had
no
commerce
with
the
outside
when
i
was
engrossed
in
the
contemplation
of
my
own
heart
when
my
imaginings
wandered
in
many
a
disguise
amidst
causeless
emotions
and
aimless
longings
has
been
left
out
of
that
edition
only
a
few
of
the
poems
originally
published
in
the
volume
entitled
finding
a
place
there
in
the
group
my
brother
jyotirindra
and
his
wife
had
left
home
travelling
on
a
long
journey
and
their
rooms
on
the
third
storey
facing
the
were
empty
i
took
possession
of
these
and
the
terrace
and
spent
my
days
in
solitude
while
thus
left
in
communion
with
my
self
alone
i
know
not
how
i
slipped
out
of
the
poetical
groove
into
which
i
had
fallen
perhaps
being
cut
off
from
those
whom
i
sought
to
please
and
whose
taste
in
poetry
moulded
the
form
i
tried
to
put
my
thoughts
into
i
naturally
gained
freedom
from
the
style
they
had
imposed
on
me
i
began
to
use
a
slate
for
my
writing
that
also
helped
in
my
emancipation
the
manuscript
books
in
which
i
had
indulged
before
seemed
to
demand
a
certain
height
of
poetic
flight
to
work
up
to
which
i
had
to
find
my
way
by
a
comparison
with
others
but
the
slate
was
clearly
fitted
for
my
mood
of
the
moment
fear
not
it
seemed
to
say
write
just
what
you
please
one
rub
will
wipe
all
away
as
i
wrote
a
poem
or
two
thus
unfettered
i
felt
a
great
joy
well
up
within
me
at
last
said
my
heart
what
i
write
is
my
own
let
no
one
mistake
this
for
an
accession
of
pride
rather
did
i
feel
a
pride
in
my
former
productions
as
being
all
the
tribute
i
had
to
pay
them
but
i
refuse
to
call
the
realisation
of
self
the
joy
of
parents
in
their
is
not
due
to
any
pride
in
its
appearance
but
because
it
is
their
very
own
if
it
happens
to
be
an
extraordinary
child
they
may
also
glory
in
that
but
that
is
different
in
the
first
of
that
joy
i
paid
no
heed
to
the
bounds
of
metrical
form
and
as
the
stream
does
not
flow
straight
on
but
winds
about
as
it
lists
so
did
my
verse
before
i
would
have
held
this
to
be
a
crime
but
now
i
felt
no
compunction
freedom
first
breaks
the
law
and
then
makes
laws
which
brings
it
under
true
the
only
listener
i
had
for
these
erratic
poems
of
mine
was
akshay
babu
when
he
heard
them
for
the
first
time
he
was
as
surprised
as
he
was
pleased
and
with
his
approbation
my
road
to
freedom
was
widened
the
poems
of
vihari
chakravarti
were
in
a
metre
this
triple
time
produces
a
globular
effect
unlike
the
multiple
of
it
rolls
on
with
ease
it
glides
as
it
dances
to
the
tinkling
of
its
anklets
i
was
once
very
fond
of
this
metre
it
felt
more
like
riding
a
bicycle
than
walking
and
to
this
stride
i
had
got
accustomed
in
the
without
thinking
of
it
i
somehow
broke
off
this
habit
nor
did
i
come
under
any
other
particular
bondage
i
felt
entirely
free
and
unconcerned
i
had
no
thought
or
fear
of
being
taken
to
task
the
strength
i
gained
by
working
freed
from
the
trammels
of
tradition
led
me
to
discover
that
i
had
been
searching
in
impossible
places
for
that
which
i
had
within
myself
nothing
but
want
of
had
stood
in
the
way
of
my
coming
into
my
own
i
felt
like
rising
from
a
dream
of
bondage
to
find
myself
unshackled
i
cut
extraordinary
capers
just
to
make
sure
i
was
free
to
move
to
me
this
is
the
most
memorable
period
of
my
poetic
career
as
poems
my
may
not
have
been
worth
much
in
fact
as
such
they
are
crude
enough
neither
their
metre
nor
language
nor
thought
had
taken
definite
shape
their
only
merit
is
that
for
the
first
time
i
had
come
to
write
what
i
really
meant
just
according
to
my
pleasure
what
if
those
compositions
have
no
value
that
pleasure
certainly
had
essay
on
i
had
been
proposing
to
study
for
the
bar
when
my
father
had
recalled
me
home
from
england
some
friends
concerned
at
this
cutting
short
of
my
career
pressed
him
to
send
me
off
once
again
this
led
to
my
starting
on
a
second
voyage
towards
england
this
time
with
a
relative
as
my
companion
my
fate
however
had
so
strongly
vetoed
my
being
called
to
the
bar
that
i
was
not
even
to
reach
england
this
time
for
a
certain
reason
we
had
to
disembark
at
madras
and
return
home
to
calcutta
the
reason
was
by
no
means
as
grave
as
its
outcome
but
as
the
laugh
was
not
against
i
refrain
from
setting
it
down
here
from
both
my
attempted
pilgrimages
to
shrine
i
had
thus
to
come
back
repulsed
i
hope
however
that
the
at
least
will
look
on
me
with
a
favourable
eye
for
that
i
have
not
added
to
the
encumbrances
on
the
premises
my
father
was
then
in
the
mussoorie
hills
i
went
to
him
in
fear
and
trembling
but
he
showed
no
sign
of
irritation
he
rather
seemed
pleased
he
must
have
seen
in
this
return
of
mine
the
blessing
of
divine
providence
the
evening
before
i
started
on
this
voyage
i
read
a
paper
at
the
medical
college
hall
on
the
invitation
of
the
bethune
society
this
was
my
first
public
reading
the
reverend
banerji
was
the
president
the
subject
was
music
leaving
aside
instrumental
music
i
tried
to
make
out
that
to
bring
out
better
what
the
words
sought
to
express
was
the
chief
end
and
aim
of
vocal
music
the
text
of
my
paper
was
but
meagre
i
sang
and
acted
songs
throughout
illustrating
my
theme
the
only
reason
for
the
flattering
eulogy
which
the
president
bestowed
on
me
at
the
end
must
have
been
the
moving
effect
of
my
young
voice
together
with
the
earnestness
and
variety
of
its
efforts
but
i
must
make
the
confession
that
the
opinion
i
voiced
with
such
enthusiasm
that
evening
was
wrong
the
art
of
vocal
music
has
its
own
special
functions
and
features
and
when
it
happens
to
be
set
to
words
the
latter
must
not
presume
too
much
on
their
opportunity
and
seek
to
supersede
the
melody
of
which
they
are
but
the
vehicle
the
song
being
great
in
its
own
wealth
why
should
it
wait
upon
the
words
rather
does
it
begin
where
mere
words
fail
its
power
lies
in
the
region
of
the
inexpressible
it
tells
us
what
the
words
can
not
so
the
less
a
song
is
burdened
with
words
the
better
in
the
classic
style
of
hindustan
the
words
are
of
no
account
and
leave
the
melody
to
make
its
appeal
in
its
own
way
vocal
music
reaches
its
perfection
when
the
melodic
form
is
allowed
to
develop
freely
and
carry
our
consciousness
with
it
to
its
own
wonderful
plane
in
bengal
however
the
words
have
always
asserted
themselves
so
that
our
provincial
song
has
failed
to
develop
her
full
musical
capabilities
and
has
remained
content
as
the
handmaiden
of
her
sister
art
of
poetry
from
the
old
songs
down
to
those
of
nidhu
babu
she
has
displayed
her
charms
from
the
background
but
as
in
our
country
the
wife
rules
her
husband
through
acknowledging
her
dependence
so
our
music
though
professedly
in
attendance
only
ends
by
dominating
the
song
i
have
often
felt
this
while
composing
my
songs
as
i
hummed
to
myself
and
wrote
the
lines
do
not
keep
your
secret
to
yourself
my
love
but
whisper
it
gently
to
me
only
to
me
i
found
that
the
words
had
no
means
of
reaching
by
themselves
the
region
into
which
they
were
borne
away
by
the
tune
the
melody
told
me
that
the
secret
which
i
was
so
importunate
to
hear
had
mingled
with
the
green
mystery
of
the
forest
glades
was
steeped
in
the
silent
whiteness
of
moonlight
nights
peeped
out
of
the
veil
of
the
illimitable
blue
behind
the
horizon
and
is
the
one
intimate
secret
of
earth
sky
and
waters
in
my
early
boyhood
i
heard
a
snatch
of
a
song
who
dressed
you
love
as
a
foreigner
this
one
line
painted
such
wonderful
pictures
in
my
mind
that
it
haunts
me
still
one
day
i
sat
down
to
set
to
words
a
composition
of
my
own
while
full
of
this
bit
of
song
humming
my
tune
i
wrote
to
its
accompaniment
i
know
you
o
woman
from
the
strange
land
your
dwelling
is
across
the
sea
had
the
tune
not
been
there
i
know
not
what
shape
the
rest
of
the
poem
might
have
taken
but
the
magic
of
the
melody
revealed
to
me
the
stranger
in
all
her
loveliness
it
is
she
said
my
soul
who
comes
and
goes
a
messenger
to
this
world
from
the
other
shore
of
the
ocean
of
mystery
it
is
she
of
whom
we
now
and
again
catch
glimpses
in
the
dewy
autumn
mornings
in
the
scented
nights
of
spring
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
our
hearts
and
sometimes
we
strain
skywards
to
hear
her
song
to
the
door
of
this
stranger
the
melody
as
i
say
wafted
me
and
so
to
her
were
the
rest
of
the
words
addressed
long
after
this
in
a
street
in
bolpur
a
mendicant
was
singing
as
he
walked
along
how
does
the
unknown
bird
flit
in
and
out
of
the
cage
ah
could
i
but
catch
it
i
ring
its
feet
with
my
love
i
found
this
to
be
saying
the
very
same
thing
the
unknown
bird
sometimes
surrenders
itself
within
the
bars
of
the
cage
to
whisper
tidings
of
the
bondless
unknown
beyond
the
heart
would
fain
hold
it
near
to
itself
for
ever
but
can
not
what
but
the
melody
of
song
can
tell
us
of
the
goings
and
comings
of
the
unknown
bird
that
is
why
i
am
always
reluctant
to
publish
books
of
the
words
of
songs
for
therein
the
soul
must
needs
be
lacking
when
i
returned
home
from
the
outset
of
my
second
voyage
to
england
my
brother
jyotirindra
and
were
living
in
a
villa
at
chandernagore
and
there
i
went
to
stay
with
them
the
ganges
again
again
those
ineffable
days
and
nights
languid
with
joy
sad
with
longing
attuned
to
the
plaintive
babbling
of
the
river
along
the
cool
shade
of
its
wooded
banks
this
bengal
of
light
this
south
breeze
this
flow
of
the
river
this
right
royal
laziness
this
broad
leisure
stretching
from
horizon
to
horizon
and
from
green
earth
to
blue
sky
all
these
were
to
me
as
food
and
drink
to
the
hungry
and
thirsty
here
it
felt
indeed
like
home
and
in
these
i
recognised
the
ministrations
of
a
mother
that
was
not
so
very
long
ago
and
yet
time
has
wrought
many
changes
our
little
nests
clustering
under
their
surrounding
greenery
have
been
replaced
by
mills
which
now
everywhere
rear
their
hissing
heads
belching
forth
black
smoke
in
the
midday
glare
of
modern
life
even
our
hours
of
mental
siesta
have
been
narrowed
down
to
the
lowest
limit
and
unrest
has
invaded
every
department
of
life
maybe
this
is
for
the
better
but
i
for
one
can
not
account
it
wholly
to
the
good
illustration
the
ganges
again
these
lovely
days
of
mine
at
the
riverside
passed
by
like
so
many
dedicated
lotus
blossoms
floating
down
the
sacred
stream
some
rainy
afternoons
i
spent
in
a
veritable
frenzy
singing
away
old
songs
to
my
own
tunes
accompanying
myself
on
a
harmonium
on
other
afternoons
we
would
drift
along
in
a
boat
my
brother
jyotirindra
accompanying
my
singing
with
his
violin
and
as
beginning
with
the
we
went
on
varying
the
mode
of
our
music
with
the
declining
day
we
saw
on
reaching
the
the
western
sky
close
the
doors
of
its
factory
of
golden
toys
and
the
moon
on
the
east
rise
over
the
fringe
of
trees
then
we
would
row
back
to
the
landing
steps
of
the
villa
and
seat
ourselves
on
a
quilt
spread
on
the
terrace
facing
the
river
by
then
a
silvery
peace
rested
on
both
land
and
water
hardly
any
boats
were
about
the
fringe
of
trees
on
the
bank
was
reduced
to
a
deep
shadow
and
the
moonlight
glimmered
over
the
smooth
flowing
stream
the
villa
we
were
living
in
was
known
as
garden
a
flight
of
steps
led
up
from
the
water
to
a
long
broad
verandah
which
formed
part
of
the
house
the
rooms
were
not
regularly
arranged
nor
all
on
the
same
level
and
some
had
to
be
reached
by
short
flights
of
stairs
the
big
sitting
room
overlooking
the
landing
steps
had
stained
glass
windows
with
coloured
pictures
one
of
the
pictures
was
of
a
swing
hanging
from
a
branch
in
dense
foliage
and
in
the
checkered
light
and
shade
of
this
bower
two
persons
were
swinging
and
there
was
another
of
a
broad
flight
of
steps
leading
into
some
palace
up
and
down
which
men
and
women
in
festive
garb
were
going
and
coming
when
the
light
fell
on
the
windows
these
pictures
shone
wonderfully
seeming
to
fill
the
atmosphere
with
holiday
music
some
revelry
seemed
to
be
expressing
itself
in
silent
words
of
light
the
love
thrills
of
the
swinging
couple
making
alive
with
their
eternal
story
the
woodlands
of
the
river
bank
the
topmost
room
of
the
house
was
in
a
round
tower
with
windows
opening
to
every
side
this
i
used
as
my
room
for
writing
poetry
nothing
could
be
seen
from
thence
save
the
tops
of
the
surrounding
trees
and
the
open
sky
i
was
then
busy
with
the
and
of
this
room
i
wrote
there
where
in
the
breast
of
limitless
space
clouds
are
laid
to
sleep
i
have
built
my
house
for
thee
o
poesy
about
the
evening
at
this
time
my
reputation
amongst
literary
critics
was
that
of
being
a
poet
of
broken
cadence
and
lisping
utterance
everything
about
my
work
was
dubbed
misty
shadowy
however
little
i
might
have
relished
this
at
the
time
the
charge
was
not
wholly
baseless
my
poetry
did
in
fact
lack
the
backbone
of
worldly
reality
how
amidst
the
seclusion
of
my
early
years
was
i
to
get
the
necessary
material
but
one
thing
i
refuse
to
admit
behind
this
charge
of
vagueness
was
the
sting
of
the
insinuation
of
its
being
a
deliberate
affectation
for
the
sake
of
effect
the
fortunate
possessor
of
good
is
apt
to
sneer
at
the
youth
with
glasses
as
if
he
wears
them
for
ornament
while
a
reflection
on
the
poor
fellow
infirmity
may
be
permissible
it
is
too
bad
to
charge
him
with
pretending
not
to
see
the
nebula
is
not
an
outside
creation
it
merely
represents
a
phase
and
to
leave
out
all
poetry
which
has
not
attained
definiteness
would
not
bring
us
to
the
truth
of
literature
if
any
phase
of
man
nature
has
found
true
expression
it
is
worth
preserving
it
may
be
cast
aside
only
if
not
expressed
truly
there
is
a
period
in
man
life
when
his
feelings
are
the
pathos
of
the
inexpressible
the
anguish
of
vagueness
the
poetry
which
attempts
its
expression
can
not
be
called
baseless
at
worst
it
may
be
worthless
but
it
is
not
necessarily
even
that
the
sin
is
not
in
the
thing
expressed
but
in
the
failure
to
express
it
there
is
a
duality
in
man
of
the
inner
person
behind
the
outward
current
of
thoughts
feelings
and
events
but
little
is
known
or
recked
but
for
all
that
he
can
not
be
got
rid
of
as
a
factor
in
progress
when
the
outward
life
fails
to
harmonise
with
the
inner
the
dweller
within
is
hurt
and
his
pain
manifests
itself
in
the
outer
consciousness
in
a
manner
to
which
it
is
difficult
to
give
a
name
or
even
to
describe
and
of
which
the
cry
is
more
akin
to
an
inarticulate
wail
than
words
with
more
precise
meaning
the
sadness
and
pain
which
sought
expression
in
the
had
their
roots
in
the
depths
of
my
being
as
one
consciousness
wrestles
with
a
nightmare
in
its
efforts
to
awake
so
the
submerged
inner
self
struggles
to
free
itself
from
its
complexities
and
come
out
into
the
open
these
are
the
history
of
that
struggle
as
in
all
creation
so
in
poetry
there
is
the
opposition
of
forces
if
the
divergence
is
too
wide
or
the
unison
too
close
there
is
it
seems
to
me
no
room
for
poetry
where
the
pain
of
discord
strives
to
attain
and
express
its
resolution
into
harmony
there
does
poetry
break
forth
into
music
as
breath
through
a
flute
when
the
first
saw
the
light
they
were
not
hailed
with
any
flourish
of
trumpets
but
none
the
less
they
did
not
lack
admirers
i
have
elsewhere
told
the
story
of
how
at
the
wedding
of
ramesh
chandra
dutt
eldest
daughter
bankim
babu
was
at
the
door
and
the
host
was
welcoming
him
with
the
customary
garland
of
flowers
as
i
came
up
bankim
babu
eagerly
took
the
garland
and
placing
it
round
my
neck
said
the
wreath
to
him
ramesh
have
you
not
read
his
and
when
dutt
avowed
he
had
not
yet
done
so
the
manner
in
which
bankim
babu
expressed
his
opinion
of
some
of
them
amply
rewarded
me
the
gained
for
me
a
friend
whose
approval
like
the
rays
of
the
sun
stimulated
and
guided
the
shoots
of
my
newly
sprung
efforts
this
was
babu
priyanath
just
before
this
the
had
led
him
to
give
up
all
hopes
of
me
i
won
him
back
with
these
those
who
are
acquainted
with
him
know
him
as
an
expert
navigator
of
all
the
seven
seas
of
literature
whose
highways
and
byways
in
almost
all
languages
indian
and
foreign
he
is
constantly
traversing
to
converse
with
him
is
to
gain
glimpses
of
even
the
most
out
of
the
way
scenery
in
the
world
of
ideas
this
proved
of
the
greatest
value
to
me
he
was
able
to
give
his
literary
opinions
with
the
fullest
confidence
for
he
had
not
to
rely
on
his
unaided
taste
to
guide
his
likes
and
dislikes
this
authoritative
criticism
of
his
also
assisted
me
more
than
i
can
tell
i
used
to
read
to
him
everything
i
wrote
and
but
for
the
timely
showers
of
his
discriminate
appreciation
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
these
early
ploughings
of
mine
would
have
yielded
as
they
have
done
at
the
i
also
did
a
bit
of
prose
writing
not
on
any
definite
subject
or
plan
but
in
the
spirit
that
boys
catch
butterflies
when
spring
comes
within
fancies
are
born
and
flit
about
in
the
mind
ordinarily
unnoticed
in
these
days
of
my
leisure
it
was
perhaps
the
mere
whim
to
collect
them
which
had
come
upon
me
or
it
may
have
been
only
another
phase
of
my
emancipated
self
which
had
thrown
out
its
chest
and
decided
to
write
just
as
it
pleased
what
i
wrote
not
being
the
object
it
being
sufficient
unto
itself
that
it
was
i
who
wrote
these
prose
pieces
were
published
later
under
the
name
of
various
topics
but
they
expired
with
the
first
edition
and
did
not
get
a
fresh
lease
of
life
in
a
second
at
this
time
i
think
i
also
began
my
first
novel
after
we
had
stayed
for
a
time
by
the
river
my
brother
jyotirindra
took
a
house
in
calcutta
on
sudder
street
near
the
museum
i
remained
with
him
while
i
went
on
here
with
the
novel
and
the
a
momentous
revolution
of
some
kind
came
about
within
me
one
day
late
in
the
afternoon
i
was
pacing
the
terrace
of
our
jorasanko
house
the
glow
of
the
sunset
combined
with
the
wan
twilight
in
a
way
which
seemed
to
give
the
approaching
evening
a
specially
wonderful
attractiveness
for
me
even
the
walls
of
the
adjoining
house
seemed
to
grow
beautiful
is
this
uplifting
of
the
cover
of
triviality
from
the
everyday
world
i
wondered
due
to
some
magic
in
the
evening
light
never
i
could
see
at
once
that
it
was
the
effect
of
the
evening
which
had
come
within
me
its
shades
had
obliterated
my
while
the
self
was
rampant
during
the
glare
of
day
everything
i
perceived
was
mingled
with
and
hidden
by
it
now
that
the
self
was
put
into
the
background
i
could
see
the
world
in
its
own
true
aspect
and
that
aspect
has
nothing
of
triviality
in
it
it
is
full
of
beauty
and
joy
since
this
experience
i
tried
the
effect
of
deliberately
suppressing
my
and
viewing
the
world
as
a
mere
spectator
and
was
invariably
rewarded
with
a
sense
of
special
pleasure
i
remember
i
tried
also
to
explain
to
a
relative
how
to
see
the
world
in
its
true
light
and
the
incidental
lightening
of
one
own
sense
of
burden
which
follows
such
vision
but
as
i
believe
with
no
success
then
i
gained
a
further
insight
which
has
lasted
all
my
life
the
end
of
sudder
street
and
the
trees
on
the
free
school
grounds
opposite
were
visible
from
our
sudder
street
house
one
morning
i
happened
to
be
standing
on
the
verandah
looking
that
way
the
sun
was
just
rising
through
the
leafy
tops
of
those
trees
as
i
continued
to
gaze
all
of
a
sudden
a
covering
seemed
to
fall
away
from
my
eyes
and
i
found
the
world
bathed
in
a
wonderful
radiance
with
waves
of
beauty
and
joy
swelling
on
every
side
this
radiance
pierced
in
a
moment
through
the
folds
of
sadness
and
despondency
which
had
accumulated
over
my
heart
and
flooded
it
with
this
universal
light
that
very
day
the
poem
awakening
of
the
gushed
forth
and
coursed
on
like
a
veritable
cascade
the
poem
came
to
an
end
but
the
curtain
did
not
fall
upon
the
joy
aspect
of
the
universe
and
it
came
to
be
so
that
no
person
or
thing
in
the
world
seemed
to
me
trivial
or
unpleasing
a
thing
that
happened
the
next
day
or
the
day
following
seemed
specially
astonishing
there
was
a
curious
sort
of
person
who
came
to
me
now
and
then
with
a
habit
of
asking
all
manner
of
silly
questions
one
day
he
had
asked
have
you
sir
seen
god
with
your
own
eyes
and
on
my
having
to
admit
that
i
had
not
he
averred
that
he
had
what
was
it
you
saw
i
asked
he
seethed
and
throbbed
before
my
eyes
was
the
reply
it
can
well
be
imagined
that
one
would
not
ordinarily
relish
being
drawn
into
abstruse
discussions
with
such
a
person
moreover
i
was
at
the
time
entirely
absorbed
in
my
own
writing
nevertheless
as
he
was
a
harmless
sort
of
fellow
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
hurting
his
susceptibilities
and
so
tolerated
him
as
best
i
could
this
time
when
he
came
one
afternoon
i
actually
felt
glad
to
see
him
and
welcomed
him
cordially
the
mantle
of
his
oddity
and
foolishness
seemed
to
have
slipped
off
and
the
person
i
so
joyfully
hailed
was
the
real
man
whom
i
felt
to
be
in
nowise
inferior
to
myself
and
moreover
closely
related
finding
no
trace
of
annoyance
within
me
at
sight
of
him
nor
any
sense
of
my
time
being
wasted
with
him
i
was
filled
with
an
immense
gladness
and
felt
rid
of
some
enveloping
tissue
of
untruth
which
had
been
causing
me
so
much
needless
and
uncalled
for
discomfort
and
pain
as
i
would
stand
on
the
balcony
the
gait
the
figure
the
features
of
each
one
of
the
whoever
they
might
be
seemed
to
me
all
so
extraordinarily
wonderful
as
they
flowed
past
waves
on
the
sea
of
the
universe
from
infancy
i
had
seen
only
with
my
eyes
i
now
began
to
see
with
the
whole
of
my
consciousness
i
could
not
look
upon
the
sight
of
two
smiling
youths
nonchalantly
going
their
way
the
arm
of
one
on
the
other
shoulder
as
a
matter
of
small
moment
for
through
it
i
could
see
the
fathomless
depths
of
the
eternal
spring
of
joy
from
which
numberless
sprays
of
laughter
leap
up
throughout
the
world
i
had
never
before
marked
the
play
of
limbs
and
lineaments
which
always
accompanies
even
the
least
of
man
actions
now
i
was
by
their
variety
which
i
came
across
on
all
sides
at
every
moment
yet
i
saw
them
not
as
being
apart
by
themselves
but
as
parts
of
that
amazingly
beautiful
greater
dance
which
goes
on
at
this
very
moment
throughout
the
world
of
men
in
each
of
their
homes
in
their
multifarious
wants
and
activities
friend
laughs
with
friend
the
mother
fondles
her
child
one
cow
sidles
up
to
another
and
licks
its
body
and
the
immeasurability
behind
these
comes
direct
to
my
mind
with
a
shock
which
almost
savours
of
pain
when
of
this
period
i
wrote
i
know
not
how
of
a
sudden
my
heart
flung
open
its
doors
and
let
the
crowd
of
worlds
rush
in
greeting
each
other
it
was
no
poetic
exaggeration
rather
i
had
not
the
power
to
express
all
i
felt
for
some
time
together
i
remained
in
this
state
of
bliss
then
my
brother
thought
of
going
to
the
darjeeling
hills
so
much
the
better
thought
i
on
the
vast
himalayan
tops
i
shall
be
able
to
see
more
deeply
into
what
has
been
revealed
to
me
in
sudder
street
at
any
rate
i
shall
see
how
the
himalayas
display
themselves
to
my
new
gift
of
vision
but
the
victory
was
with
that
little
house
in
sudder
street
when
after
ascending
the
mountains
i
looked
around
i
was
at
once
aware
i
had
lost
my
new
vision
my
sin
must
have
been
in
imagining
that
i
could
get
still
more
of
truth
from
the
outside
however
the
king
of
mountains
may
be
he
can
have
nothing
in
his
gift
for
me
while
he
who
is
the
giver
can
vouchsafe
a
vision
of
the
eternal
universe
in
the
dingiest
of
lanes
and
in
a
moment
of
time
i
wandered
about
amongst
the
firs
i
sat
near
the
falls
and
bathed
in
their
waters
i
gazed
at
the
grandeur
of
kinchinjunga
through
a
cloudless
sky
but
in
what
had
seemed
to
me
these
likeliest
of
places
i
found
not
i
had
come
to
know
it
but
could
see
it
no
longer
while
i
was
admiring
the
gem
the
lid
had
suddenly
closed
leaving
me
staring
at
the
enclosing
casket
but
for
all
the
attractiveness
of
its
workmanship
there
was
no
longer
any
danger
of
my
mistaking
it
for
merely
an
empty
box
my
came
to
an
end
their
last
echo
dying
out
with
which
i
wrote
at
darjeeling
this
apparently
proved
such
an
abstruse
affair
that
two
friends
laid
a
wager
as
to
its
real
meaning
my
only
consolation
was
that
as
i
was
equally
unable
to
explain
the
enigma
to
them
when
they
came
to
me
for
a
solution
neither
of
them
had
to
lose
any
money
over
it
alas
the
days
when
i
wrote
excessively
plain
poems
about
and
had
gone
forever
but
does
one
write
poetry
to
explain
any
matter
what
is
felt
within
the
heart
tries
to
find
outside
shape
as
a
poem
so
when
after
listening
to
a
poem
anyone
says
he
has
not
understood
i
feel
nonplussed
if
someone
smells
a
flower
and
says
he
does
not
understand
the
reply
to
him
is
there
is
nothing
to
understand
it
is
only
a
scent
if
he
persists
saying
i
know
but
what
does
it
all
then
one
has
either
to
change
the
subject
or
make
it
more
abstruse
by
saying
that
the
scent
is
the
shape
which
the
universal
joy
takes
in
the
flower
that
words
have
meanings
is
just
the
difficulty
that
is
why
the
poet
has
to
turn
and
twist
them
in
metre
and
verse
so
that
the
meaning
may
be
held
somewhat
in
check
and
the
feeling
allowed
a
chance
to
express
itself
this
utterance
of
feeling
is
not
the
statement
of
a
fundamental
truth
or
a
scientific
fact
or
a
useful
moral
precept
like
a
tear
or
a
smile
it
is
but
a
picture
of
what
is
taking
place
within
if
science
or
philosophy
may
gain
anything
from
it
they
are
welcome
but
that
is
not
the
reason
of
its
being
if
while
crossing
a
ferry
you
can
catch
a
fish
you
are
a
lucky
man
but
that
does
not
make
the
ferry
boat
a
fishing
boat
nor
should
you
abuse
the
ferryman
if
he
does
not
make
fishing
his
business
was
written
so
long
ago
that
it
has
escaped
attention
and
i
am
now
no
longer
called
upon
to
render
an
account
of
its
meaning
nevertheless
whatever
its
other
merits
or
defects
may
be
i
can
assure
my
readers
that
it
was
not
my
intention
to
propound
a
riddle
or
insidiously
convey
any
erudite
teaching
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
a
longing
had
been
born
within
my
heart
and
unable
to
find
any
other
name
i
had
called
the
thing
i
desired
an
echo
when
from
the
original
fount
in
the
depths
of
the
universe
streams
of
melody
are
sent
forth
abroad
their
echo
is
reflected
into
our
heart
from
the
faces
of
our
beloved
and
the
other
beauteous
things
around
us
it
must
be
as
i
suggested
this
echo
which
we
love
and
not
the
things
themselves
from
which
it
happens
to
be
reflected
for
that
which
one
day
we
scarce
deign
to
glance
at
may
be
on
another
the
very
thing
which
claims
our
whole
devotion
i
had
so
long
viewed
the
world
with
external
vision
only
and
so
had
been
unable
to
see
its
universal
aspect
of
joy
when
of
a
sudden
from
some
innermost
depth
of
my
being
a
ray
of
light
found
its
way
out
it
spread
over
and
illuminated
for
me
the
whole
universe
which
then
no
longer
appeared
like
heaps
of
things
and
happenings
but
was
disclosed
to
my
sight
as
one
whole
this
experience
seemed
to
tell
me
of
the
stream
of
melody
issuing
from
the
very
heart
of
the
universe
and
spreading
over
space
and
time
thence
as
waves
of
joy
which
flow
right
back
to
the
source
when
the
artist
sends
his
song
forth
from
the
depths
of
a
full
heart
that
is
joy
indeed
and
the
joy
is
redoubled
when
this
same
song
is
wafted
back
to
him
as
hearer
if
when
the
creation
of
the
is
thus
returning
back
to
him
in
a
flood
of
joy
we
allow
it
to
flow
over
our
consciousness
we
at
once
immediately
become
aware
in
an
inexpressible
manner
of
the
end
to
which
this
flood
is
streaming
and
as
we
become
aware
our
love
goes
forth
and
our
are
moved
from
their
moorings
and
would
fain
float
down
the
stream
of
joy
to
its
infinite
goal
this
is
the
meaning
of
the
longing
which
stirs
within
us
at
the
sight
of
beauty
the
stream
which
comes
from
the
infinite
and
flows
toward
the
finite
that
is
the
true
the
good
it
is
subject
to
laws
definite
in
form
its
echo
which
returns
towards
the
infinite
is
beauty
and
joy
which
are
difficult
to
touch
or
grasp
and
so
make
us
beside
ourselves
this
is
what
i
tried
to
say
by
way
of
a
parable
or
a
song
in
that
the
result
was
not
clear
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
neither
was
the
attempt
then
clear
unto
itself
let
me
set
down
here
part
of
what
i
wrote
in
a
letter
at
a
more
advanced
age
about
the
there
is
none
in
the
world
all
are
in
my
heart
is
a
state
of
mind
belonging
to
a
particular
age
when
the
heart
is
first
awakened
it
puts
forth
its
arms
and
would
grasp
the
whole
world
like
the
teething
infant
which
thinks
everything
meant
for
its
mouth
gradually
it
comes
to
understand
what
it
really
wants
and
what
it
does
not
then
do
its
nebulous
emanations
shrink
upon
themselves
get
heated
and
heat
in
their
turn
to
begin
by
wanting
the
whole
world
is
to
get
nothing
when
desire
is
concentrated
with
the
whole
strength
of
being
upon
any
one
object
whatsoever
it
might
be
then
does
the
gateway
to
the
infinite
become
visible
the
morning
songs
were
the
first
throwing
forth
of
my
inner
self
outwards
and
consequently
they
lack
any
signs
of
such
concentration
this
joy
of
a
first
outflow
however
has
the
effect
of
leading
us
to
an
acquaintance
with
the
particular
the
lake
in
its
fulness
seeks
an
outlet
as
a
river
in
this
sense
the
permanent
later
love
is
narrower
than
first
love
it
is
more
definite
in
the
direction
of
its
activities
desires
to
realise
the
whole
in
each
of
its
parts
and
is
thus
impelled
on
towards
the
infinite
what
it
finally
reaches
is
no
longer
the
former
indefinite
extension
of
the
heart
own
inner
joy
but
a
merging
in
the
infinite
reality
which
was
outside
itself
and
thereby
the
attainment
of
the
complete
truth
of
its
own
longings
in
mohita
babu
edition
these
have
been
placed
in
the
group
of
poems
entitled
the
emergence
for
in
these
was
to
be
found
the
first
news
of
my
coming
out
of
the
into
the
open
world
thereafter
did
this
pilgrim
heart
make
its
acquaintance
with
that
world
bit
by
bit
part
by
part
in
many
a
mood
and
manner
and
at
the
end
after
gliding
past
all
the
numerous
landing
steps
of
impermanence
it
will
reach
the
infinite
not
the
vagueness
of
indeterminate
possibility
but
the
consummation
of
perfect
fulness
of
truth
from
my
earliest
years
i
enjoyed
a
simple
and
intimate
communion
with
nature
each
one
of
the
cocoanut
trees
in
our
garden
had
for
me
a
distinct
personality
when
on
coming
home
from
the
normal
school
i
saw
behind
the
skyline
of
our
clouds
thickly
banked
up
the
immense
depth
of
gladness
which
filled
me
all
in
a
moment
i
can
recall
clearly
even
now
on
opening
my
eyes
every
morning
the
blithely
awakening
world
used
to
call
me
to
join
it
like
a
playmate
the
perfervid
noonday
sky
during
the
long
silent
watches
of
the
siesta
hours
would
spirit
me
away
from
the
world
into
the
recesses
of
its
hermit
cell
and
the
darkness
of
night
would
open
the
door
to
its
phantom
paths
and
take
me
over
all
the
seven
seas
and
thirteen
rivers
past
all
possibilities
and
impossibilities
right
into
its
then
one
day
when
with
the
dawn
of
youth
my
hungry
heart
began
to
cry
out
for
its
sustenance
a
barrier
was
set
up
between
this
play
of
inside
and
outside
and
my
whole
being
eddied
round
and
round
my
troubled
heart
creating
a
vortex
within
itself
in
the
whirls
of
which
its
consciousness
was
confined
this
loss
of
the
harmony
between
inside
and
outside
due
to
the
claims
of
the
heart
in
its
hunger
and
consequent
restriction
of
the
privilege
of
communion
which
had
been
mine
was
mourned
by
me
in
the
in
the
i
celebrated
the
sudden
opening
of
a
gate
in
the
barrier
by
what
shock
i
know
not
through
which
i
regained
the
lost
one
not
only
as
i
knew
it
before
but
more
deeply
more
fully
by
force
of
the
intervening
separation
thus
did
the
first
book
of
my
life
come
to
an
end
with
these
chapters
of
union
separation
and
reunion
or
rather
it
is
not
true
to
say
it
has
come
to
an
end
the
same
subject
has
still
to
be
continued
through
more
elaborate
solutions
of
worse
complexities
to
a
greater
conclusion
each
one
comes
here
to
finish
but
one
book
of
life
which
during
the
progress
of
its
various
parts
grows
on
an
radius
so
while
each
segment
may
appear
different
from
the
others
at
a
cursory
glance
they
all
really
lead
back
to
the
starting
centre
the
prose
writings
of
the
period
were
published
as
i
have
said
under
the
name
of
those
others
which
correspond
to
the
time
of
my
writing
the
came
out
under
the
title
of
discussions
the
difference
between
the
characteristics
of
these
two
would
be
a
good
index
of
the
nature
of
the
change
that
had
in
the
meantime
taken
place
within
me
part
vii
it
was
about
this
time
that
my
brother
jyotirindra
had
the
idea
of
founding
a
literary
academy
by
bringing
together
all
the
men
of
letters
of
repute
to
compile
authoritative
technical
terms
for
the
bengali
language
and
in
other
ways
to
assist
in
its
growth
was
to
be
its
object
therein
differing
but
little
from
the
lines
on
which
the
modern
academy
of
literature
has
taken
shape
rajendrahal
mitra
took
up
the
idea
of
this
academy
with
enthusiasm
and
he
was
eventually
its
president
for
the
short
time
it
lasted
when
i
went
to
invite
pandit
vidyasagar
to
join
it
he
gave
a
hearing
to
my
explanation
of
its
objects
and
the
names
of
the
proposed
members
then
said
my
advice
to
you
is
to
leave
us
out
you
will
never
accomplish
anything
with
big
wigs
they
can
never
be
got
to
agree
with
one
another
with
which
he
refused
to
come
in
bankim
babu
became
a
member
but
i
can
not
say
that
he
took
much
interest
in
the
work
to
be
plain
so
long
as
this
academy
lived
rajendrahal
mitra
did
everything
he
began
with
geographical
terms
the
draft
list
was
made
out
by
rajendrahal
himself
and
was
printed
and
circulated
for
the
suggestions
of
the
members
we
had
also
an
idea
of
transliterating
in
bengali
the
name
of
each
foreign
country
as
pronounced
by
itself
pandit
vidyasagar
prophecy
was
fulfilled
it
did
not
prove
possible
to
get
the
big
wigs
to
do
anything
and
the
academy
withered
away
shortly
after
sprouting
but
rajendrahal
mitra
was
an
expert
and
was
an
academy
in
himself
my
labours
in
this
cause
were
more
than
repaid
by
the
privilege
of
his
acquaintance
i
have
met
many
bengali
men
of
letters
in
my
time
but
none
who
left
the
impression
of
such
brilliance
i
used
to
go
and
see
him
in
the
office
of
the
court
of
wards
in
maniktala
i
would
go
in
the
mornings
and
always
find
him
busy
with
his
studies
and
with
the
inconsiderateness
of
youth
i
felt
no
hesitation
in
disturbing
him
but
i
have
never
seen
him
the
least
bit
put
out
on
that
account
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
would
put
aside
his
work
and
begin
to
talk
to
me
it
is
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
he
was
somewhat
hard
of
hearing
so
he
hardly
ever
gave
me
occasion
to
put
him
any
question
he
would
take
up
some
broad
subject
and
talk
away
upon
it
and
it
was
the
attraction
of
these
discourses
which
drew
me
there
converse
with
no
other
person
ever
gave
me
such
a
wealth
of
suggestive
ideas
on
so
many
different
subjects
i
would
listen
enraptured
i
think
he
was
a
member
of
the
committee
and
every
book
he
received
for
approval
he
read
through
and
annotated
in
pencil
on
some
occasions
he
would
select
one
of
these
books
for
the
text
of
discourses
on
the
construction
of
the
bengali
language
in
particular
or
philology
in
general
which
were
of
the
greatest
benefit
to
me
there
were
few
subjects
which
he
had
not
studied
and
anything
he
had
studied
he
could
clearly
expound
if
we
had
not
relied
on
the
other
members
of
the
academy
we
had
tried
to
found
but
left
everything
to
rajendrahal
the
present
would
have
doubtless
found
the
matters
it
is
now
occupied
with
left
in
a
much
more
advanced
state
by
that
one
man
alone
rajendrahal
mitra
was
not
only
a
profound
scholar
but
he
had
likewise
a
striking
personality
which
shone
through
his
features
full
of
fire
as
he
was
in
his
public
life
he
could
also
unbend
graciously
so
as
to
talk
on
the
most
difficult
subjects
to
a
stripling
like
myself
without
any
trace
of
a
patronising
tone
i
even
took
advantage
of
his
condescension
to
the
extent
of
getting
a
contribution
from
him
for
the
bharabi
there
were
other
great
contemporaries
of
his
with
whom
i
would
not
have
ventured
to
take
such
liberties
nor
would
i
have
met
with
the
like
response
if
i
had
and
yet
when
he
was
on
the
war
path
his
opponents
on
the
municipal
corporation
or
the
senate
of
the
university
were
mortally
afraid
of
him
in
those
days
kristo
das
pal
was
the
tactful
politician
and
rajendrahal
mitra
the
valiant
fighter
for
the
purposes
of
the
asiatic
society
publications
and
researches
he
had
to
employ
a
number
of
sanscrit
pandits
to
do
the
mechanical
work
for
him
i
remember
how
this
gave
certain
envious
and
detractors
the
opportunity
of
saying
that
everything
was
really
done
by
these
pandits
while
rajendrahal
fraudulently
appropriated
all
the
credit
even
we
very
often
find
the
tools
arrogating
to
themselves
the
lion
share
of
the
achievement
imagining
the
wielder
to
be
a
mere
ornamental
figurehead
if
the
poor
pen
had
a
mind
it
would
as
certainly
have
bemoaned
the
unfairness
of
its
getting
all
the
stain
and
the
writer
all
the
glory
it
is
curious
that
this
extraordinary
man
should
have
got
no
recognition
from
his
countrymen
even
after
his
death
one
of
the
reasons
may
be
that
the
national
mourning
for
vidyasagar
whose
death
followed
shortly
after
left
no
room
for
a
recognition
of
the
other
bereavement
another
reason
may
be
that
his
main
contributions
being
outside
the
pale
of
bengali
literature
he
had
been
unable
to
reach
the
heart
of
the
people
our
sudder
street
party
next
transferred
itself
to
karwar
on
the
west
sea
coast
karwar
is
the
headquarters
of
the
kanara
district
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
bombay
presidency
it
is
the
tract
of
the
malaya
hills
of
sanskrit
literature
where
grow
the
cardamum
creeper
and
the
sandal
tree
my
second
brother
was
then
judge
there
the
little
harbour
ringed
round
with
hills
is
so
secluded
that
it
has
nothing
of
the
aspect
of
a
port
about
it
its
crescent
shaped
beach
throws
out
its
arms
to
the
shoreless
open
sea
like
the
very
image
of
an
eager
striving
to
embrace
the
infinite
the
edge
of
the
broad
sandy
beach
is
fringed
with
a
forest
of
casuarinas
broken
at
one
end
by
the
river
which
here
flows
into
the
sea
after
passing
through
a
gorge
flanked
by
rows
of
hills
on
either
side
i
remember
how
one
moonlit
evening
we
went
up
this
river
in
a
little
boat
we
stopped
at
one
of
shivaji
old
hill
forts
and
stepping
ashore
found
our
way
into
the
little
yard
of
a
home
we
sat
on
a
spot
where
the
moonbeams
fell
glancing
off
the
top
of
the
outer
enclosure
and
there
dined
off
the
eatables
we
had
brought
with
us
on
our
way
back
we
let
the
boat
glide
down
the
river
the
night
brooded
over
the
motionless
hills
and
forests
and
on
the
silent
flowing
stream
of
this
little
throwing
over
all
its
moonlight
spell
it
took
us
a
good
long
time
to
reach
the
mouth
of
the
river
so
instead
of
returning
by
sea
we
got
off
the
boat
there
and
walked
back
home
over
the
sands
of
the
beach
it
was
then
far
into
the
night
the
sea
was
without
a
ripple
even
the
murmur
of
the
casuarinas
was
at
rest
the
shadow
of
the
fringe
of
trees
along
the
vast
expanse
of
sand
hung
motionless
along
its
border
and
the
ring
of
hills
around
the
horizon
slept
calmly
beneath
the
sky
illustration
karwar
beach
through
the
deep
silence
of
this
illimitable
whiteness
we
few
human
creatures
walked
along
with
our
shadows
without
a
word
when
we
reached
home
my
sleep
had
lost
itself
in
something
still
deeper
the
poem
which
i
then
wrote
is
inextricably
mingled
with
that
night
on
the
distant
seashore
i
do
not
know
how
it
will
appeal
to
the
reader
apart
from
the
memories
with
which
it
is
entwined
this
doubt
led
to
its
being
left
out
of
mohita
babu
edition
of
my
works
i
trust
that
a
place
given
to
it
among
my
reminiscences
may
not
be
deemed
unfitting
let
me
sink
down
losing
myself
in
the
depths
of
midnight
let
the
earth
leave
her
hold
of
me
let
her
free
me
from
her
obstacle
of
dust
keep
your
watch
from
afar
o
stars
drunk
though
you
be
with
moonlight
and
let
the
horizon
hold
its
wings
still
around
me
let
there
be
no
song
no
word
no
sound
no
touch
nor
sleep
nor
awakening
but
only
the
moonlight
like
a
swoon
of
ecstasy
over
the
sky
and
my
being
the
world
seems
to
me
like
a
ship
with
its
countless
pilgrims
vanishing
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
its
sailors
song
becoming
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
air
while
i
sink
in
the
bosom
of
the
endless
night
fading
away
from
myself
dwindling
into
a
point
it
is
necessary
to
remark
here
that
merely
because
something
has
been
written
when
feelings
are
brimming
over
it
is
not
therefore
necessarily
good
such
is
rather
a
time
when
the
utterance
is
thick
with
emotion
just
as
it
does
not
do
to
have
the
writer
entirely
removed
from
the
feeling
to
which
he
is
giving
expression
so
also
it
does
not
conduce
to
the
truest
poetry
to
have
him
too
close
to
it
memory
is
the
brush
which
can
best
lay
on
the
true
poetic
colour
nearness
has
too
much
of
the
compelling
about
it
and
the
imagination
is
not
sufficiently
free
unless
it
can
get
away
from
its
influence
not
only
in
poetry
but
in
all
art
the
mind
of
the
artist
must
attain
a
certain
degree
of
aloofness
the
within
man
must
be
allowed
the
sole
control
if
the
subject
matter
gets
the
better
of
the
creation
the
result
is
a
mere
replica
of
the
event
not
a
reflection
of
it
through
the
artist
mind
here
in
karwar
i
wrote
the
nature
revenge
a
dramatic
poem
the
hero
was
a
sanyasi
hermit
who
had
been
striving
to
gain
a
victory
over
nature
by
cutting
away
the
bonds
of
all
desires
and
affections
and
thus
to
arrive
at
a
true
and
profound
knowledge
of
self
a
little
girl
however
brought
him
back
from
his
communion
with
the
infinite
to
the
world
and
into
the
bondage
of
human
affection
on
so
coming
back
the
realised
that
the
great
is
to
be
found
in
the
small
the
infinite
within
the
bounds
of
form
and
the
eternal
freedom
of
the
soul
in
love
it
is
only
in
the
light
of
love
that
all
limits
are
merged
in
the
limitless
the
sea
beach
of
karwar
is
certainly
a
fit
place
in
which
to
realise
that
the
beauty
of
nature
is
not
a
mirage
of
the
imagination
but
reflects
the
joy
of
the
infinite
and
thus
draws
us
to
lose
ourselves
in
it
where
the
universe
is
expressing
itself
in
the
magic
of
its
laws
it
may
not
be
strange
if
we
miss
its
infinitude
but
where
the
heart
gets
into
immediate
touch
with
immensity
in
the
beauty
of
the
meanest
of
things
is
any
room
left
for
argument
nature
took
the
to
the
presence
of
the
infinite
enthroned
on
the
finite
by
the
pathway
of
the
heart
in
the
there
were
shown
on
the
one
side
the
wayfarers
and
the
villagers
content
with
their
triviality
and
unconscious
of
anything
beyond
and
on
the
other
the
busy
casting
away
his
all
and
himself
into
the
infinite
of
his
imagination
when
love
bridged
the
gulf
between
the
two
and
the
hermit
and
the
householder
met
the
seeming
triviality
of
the
finite
and
the
seeming
emptiness
of
the
infinite
alike
disappeared
this
was
to
put
in
a
slightly
different
form
the
story
of
my
own
experience
of
the
entrancing
ray
of
light
which
found
its
way
into
the
depths
of
the
cave
into
which
i
had
retired
away
from
all
touch
with
the
outer
world
and
made
me
more
fully
one
with
nature
again
this
may
be
looked
upon
as
an
introduction
to
the
whole
of
my
future
literary
work
or
rather
this
has
been
the
subject
on
which
all
my
writings
have
dwelt
the
joy
of
attaining
the
infinite
within
the
finite
on
our
way
back
from
karwar
i
wrote
some
songs
for
the
on
board
ship
the
first
one
filled
me
with
a
great
gladness
as
i
sang
and
wrote
it
sitting
on
the
deck
mother
leave
your
darling
boy
to
us
and
let
us
take
him
to
the
field
where
we
graze
our
cattle
the
sun
has
risen
the
buds
have
opened
the
cowherd
boys
are
going
to
the
pasture
and
they
would
not
have
the
sunlight
the
flowers
and
their
play
in
the
grazing
grounds
empty
they
want
their
krishna
to
be
with
them
there
in
the
midst
of
all
these
they
want
to
see
the
infinite
in
all
its
carefully
adorned
loveliness
they
have
turned
out
so
early
because
they
want
to
join
in
its
gladsome
play
in
the
midst
of
these
woods
and
fields
and
hills
and
dales
not
to
admire
from
a
distance
nor
in
the
majesty
of
power
their
equipment
is
of
the
slightest
a
simple
yellow
garment
and
a
garland
of
are
all
the
ornaments
they
require
for
where
joy
reigns
on
every
side
to
hunt
for
it
arduously
or
amidst
pomp
and
circumstances
is
to
lose
it
shortly
after
my
return
from
karwar
i
was
married
i
was
then
years
of
age
and
o
picture
and
songs
was
the
title
of
a
book
of
poems
most
of
which
were
written
at
this
time
we
were
then
living
in
a
house
with
a
garden
in
lower
circular
road
adjoining
it
on
the
south
was
a
large
i
would
often
sit
near
a
window
and
watch
the
sights
of
this
populous
little
settlement
i
loved
to
see
them
at
their
work
and
play
and
rest
and
in
their
multifarious
goings
and
comings
to
me
it
was
all
like
a
living
story
a
faculty
of
possessed
me
at
this
time
each
little
separate
picture
i
ringed
round
with
the
light
of
my
imagination
and
the
joy
of
my
heart
every
one
of
them
moreover
being
variously
coloured
by
a
pathos
of
its
own
the
pleasure
of
thus
separately
marking
off
each
picture
was
much
the
same
as
that
of
painting
it
both
being
the
outcome
of
the
desire
to
see
with
the
mind
what
the
eye
sees
and
with
the
eye
what
the
mind
imagines
had
i
been
a
painter
with
the
brush
i
would
doubtless
have
tried
to
keep
a
permanent
record
of
the
visions
and
creations
of
that
period
when
my
mind
was
so
alertly
responsive
but
that
instrument
was
not
available
to
me
what
i
had
was
only
words
and
rhythms
and
even
with
these
i
had
not
yet
learnt
to
draw
firm
strokes
and
the
colours
went
beyond
their
margins
still
like
young
folk
with
their
first
paint
box
i
spent
the
livelong
day
painting
away
with
the
many
coloured
fancies
of
my
youth
if
these
pictures
are
now
viewed
in
the
light
of
that
year
of
my
life
some
features
may
be
discerned
even
through
their
crude
drawing
and
blurred
colouring
i
have
said
that
the
first
book
of
my
literary
life
came
to
an
end
with
the
the
same
subject
was
then
continued
under
a
different
rendering
many
a
page
at
the
outset
of
this
book
i
am
sure
is
of
no
value
in
the
process
of
making
a
new
beginning
much
in
the
way
of
superfluous
preliminary
has
to
be
gone
through
had
these
been
leaves
of
trees
they
would
have
duly
dropped
off
unfortunately
leaves
of
books
continue
to
stick
fast
even
when
they
are
no
longer
wanted
the
feature
of
these
poems
was
the
closeness
of
attention
devoted
even
to
trifling
things
and
seized
every
opportunity
of
giving
value
to
these
by
colouring
them
with
feelings
straight
from
the
heart
or
rather
that
was
not
it
when
the
string
of
the
mind
is
properly
attuned
to
the
universe
then
at
each
point
the
universal
song
can
awaken
its
sympathetic
vibrations
it
was
because
of
this
music
roused
within
that
nothing
then
felt
trivial
to
the
writer
whatever
my
eyes
fell
upon
found
a
response
within
me
like
children
who
can
play
with
sand
or
stones
or
shells
or
whatever
they
can
get
for
the
spirit
of
play
is
within
them
so
also
we
when
filled
with
the
song
of
youth
become
aware
that
the
harp
of
the
universe
has
its
variously
tuned
strings
everywhere
stretched
and
the
nearest
may
serve
as
well
as
any
other
for
our
accompaniment
there
is
no
need
to
seek
afar
intervening
between
the
and
and
the
and
a
magazine
called
the
sprang
up
and
ended
its
brief
days
like
an
annual
plant
my
second
felt
the
want
of
an
illustrated
magazine
for
children
her
idea
was
that
the
young
people
of
the
family
would
contribute
to
it
but
as
she
felt
that
that
alone
would
not
be
enough
she
took
up
the
editorship
herself
and
asked
me
to
help
with
contributions
after
one
or
two
numbers
of
the
had
come
out
i
happened
to
go
on
a
visit
to
rajnarayan
babu
at
deoghur
on
the
return
journey
the
train
was
crowded
and
as
there
was
an
unshaded
light
just
over
the
only
berth
i
could
get
i
could
not
sleep
i
thought
i
might
as
well
take
this
opportunity
of
thinking
out
a
story
for
the
in
spite
of
my
efforts
to
get
hold
of
the
story
it
eluded
me
but
sleep
came
to
the
rescue
instead
i
saw
in
a
dream
the
stone
steps
of
a
temple
stained
with
the
blood
of
victims
of
the
sacrifice
a
little
girl
standing
there
with
her
father
asking
him
in
piteous
accents
father
what
is
this
why
all
this
blood
and
the
father
inwardly
moved
trying
with
a
show
of
gruffness
to
quiet
her
questioning
as
i
awoke
i
felt
i
had
got
my
story
i
have
many
more
such
stories
and
other
writings
as
well
this
dream
episode
i
worked
into
the
annals
of
king
gobinda
manikya
of
tipperah
and
made
out
of
it
a
little
serial
story
for
the
those
were
days
of
utter
freedom
from
care
nothing
in
particular
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
express
itself
through
my
life
or
writings
i
had
not
yet
joined
the
throng
of
travellers
on
the
path
of
life
but
was
a
mere
spectator
from
my
roadside
window
many
a
person
hied
by
on
many
an
errand
as
i
gazed
on
and
every
now
and
then
spring
or
autumn
or
the
rains
would
enter
unasked
and
stay
with
me
for
a
while
but
i
had
not
only
to
do
with
the
seasons
there
were
men
of
all
kinds
of
curious
types
who
floating
about
like
boats
adrift
from
their
anchorage
occasionally
invaded
my
little
room
some
of
them
sought
to
further
their
own
ends
at
the
cost
of
my
inexperience
with
many
an
extraordinary
device
but
they
need
not
have
taken
any
extraordinary
pains
to
get
the
better
of
me
i
was
then
entirely
unsophisticated
my
own
wants
were
few
and
i
was
not
at
all
clever
in
distinguishing
between
good
and
bad
faith
i
have
often
gone
on
imagining
that
i
was
assisting
with
their
school
fees
students
to
whom
fees
were
as
superfluous
as
their
unread
books
once
a
youth
brought
me
a
letter
from
an
imaginary
sister
in
which
she
asked
me
to
take
under
my
protection
this
brother
of
hers
who
was
suffering
from
the
tyranny
of
a
stepmother
as
imaginary
as
herself
the
brother
was
not
imaginary
that
was
evident
enough
but
his
letter
was
as
unnecessary
for
me
as
expert
marksmanship
to
bring
down
a
bird
which
can
not
fly
another
young
fellow
came
and
informed
me
that
he
was
studying
for
the
but
could
not
go
up
for
his
examination
as
he
was
afflicted
with
some
brain
trouble
i
felt
concerned
but
being
far
from
proficient
in
medical
science
or
in
any
other
science
i
was
at
a
loss
what
advice
to
give
him
but
he
went
on
to
explain
that
he
had
seen
in
a
dream
that
my
wife
had
been
his
mother
in
a
former
birth
and
that
if
he
could
but
drink
some
water
which
had
touched
her
feet
he
would
get
cured
perhaps
you
do
believe
in
such
things
he
concluded
with
a
smile
my
belief
i
said
did
not
matter
but
if
he
thought
he
could
get
cured
he
was
welcome
with
which
i
procured
him
a
phial
of
water
which
was
supposed
to
have
touched
my
wife
feet
he
felt
immensely
better
he
said
in
the
natural
course
of
evolution
from
water
he
came
to
solid
food
then
he
took
up
his
quarters
in
a
corner
of
my
room
and
began
to
hold
smoking
parties
with
his
friends
till
i
had
to
take
refuge
in
flight
from
the
smoke
laden
air
he
gradually
proved
beyond
doubt
that
his
brain
might
have
been
diseased
but
it
certainly
was
not
weak
after
this
experience
it
took
no
end
of
proof
before
i
could
bring
myself
to
put
my
trust
in
children
of
previous
births
my
reputation
must
have
spread
for
i
next
received
a
letter
from
a
daughter
here
however
i
gently
but
firmly
drew
the
line
all
this
time
my
friendship
with
babu
srish
chandra
magundar
ripened
apace
every
evening
he
and
prija
babu
would
come
to
this
little
room
of
mine
and
we
would
discuss
literature
and
music
far
into
the
night
sometimes
a
whole
day
would
be
spent
in
the
same
way
the
fact
is
my
had
not
yet
been
moulded
and
nourished
into
a
strong
and
definite
personality
and
so
my
life
drifted
along
as
light
and
easy
as
an
autumn
cloud
this
was
the
time
when
my
acquaintance
with
bankim
babu
began
my
first
sight
of
him
was
a
matter
of
long
before
the
old
students
of
calcutta
university
had
then
started
an
annual
reunion
of
which
babu
chandranath
basu
was
the
leading
spirit
perhaps
he
entertained
a
hope
that
at
some
future
time
i
might
acquire
the
right
to
be
one
of
them
anyhow
i
was
asked
to
read
a
poem
on
the
occasion
chandranath
babu
was
then
quite
a
young
man
i
remember
he
had
translated
some
martial
german
poem
into
english
which
he
proposed
to
recite
himself
on
the
day
and
came
to
rehearse
it
to
us
full
of
enthusiasm
that
a
warrior
poet
ode
to
his
beloved
sword
should
at
one
time
have
been
his
favourite
poem
will
convince
the
reader
that
even
chandranath
babu
was
once
young
and
moreover
that
those
times
were
indeed
peculiar
while
wandering
about
in
the
crush
at
the
students
reunion
i
suddenly
came
across
a
figure
which
at
once
struck
me
as
distinguished
beyond
that
of
all
the
others
and
who
could
not
have
possibly
been
lost
in
any
crowd
the
features
of
that
tall
fair
personage
shone
with
such
a
striking
radiance
that
i
could
not
contain
my
curiosity
about
him
he
was
the
only
one
there
whose
name
i
felt
concerned
to
know
that
day
when
i
learnt
he
was
bankim
babu
i
marvelled
all
the
more
it
seemed
to
me
such
a
wonderful
coincidence
that
his
appearance
should
be
as
distinguished
as
his
writings
his
sharp
aquiline
nose
his
compressed
lips
and
his
keen
glance
all
betokened
immense
power
with
his
arms
folded
across
his
breast
he
seemed
to
walk
as
one
apart
towering
above
the
ordinary
throng
this
is
what
struck
me
most
about
him
not
only
that
he
looked
an
intellectual
giant
but
he
had
on
his
forehead
the
mark
of
a
true
prince
among
men
one
little
incident
which
occurred
at
this
gathering
remains
indelibly
impressed
on
my
mind
in
one
of
the
rooms
a
pandit
was
reciting
some
sanskrit
verses
of
his
own
composition
and
explaining
them
in
bengali
to
the
audience
one
of
the
allusions
was
not
exactly
coarse
but
somewhat
vulgar
as
the
pandit
was
proceeding
to
expound
this
bankim
babu
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
hurried
out
of
the
room
i
was
near
the
door
and
can
still
see
before
me
that
shrinking
retreating
figure
after
that
i
often
longed
to
see
him
but
could
not
get
an
opportunity
at
last
one
day
when
he
was
deputy
magistrate
of
hawrah
i
made
bold
to
call
on
him
we
met
and
i
tried
my
best
to
make
conversation
but
i
somehow
felt
greatly
abashed
while
returning
home
as
if
i
had
acted
like
a
raw
and
bumptious
youth
in
thus
thrusting
myself
upon
him
unasked
and
unintroduced
shortly
after
as
i
added
to
my
years
i
attained
a
place
as
the
youngest
of
the
literary
men
of
the
time
but
what
was
to
be
my
position
in
order
of
merit
was
not
even
then
settled
the
little
reputation
i
had
acquired
was
mixed
with
plenty
of
doubt
and
not
a
little
of
condescension
it
was
then
the
fashion
in
bengal
to
assign
each
man
of
letters
a
place
in
comparison
with
a
supposed
compeer
in
the
west
thus
one
was
the
byron
of
bengal
another
the
emerson
and
so
forth
i
began
to
be
styled
by
some
the
bengal
shelley
this
was
insulting
to
shelley
and
only
likely
to
get
me
laughed
at
my
recognised
cognomen
was
the
lisping
poet
my
attainments
were
few
my
knowledge
of
life
meagre
and
both
in
my
poetry
and
my
prose
the
sentiment
exceeded
the
substance
so
that
there
was
nothing
there
on
which
anyone
could
have
based
his
praise
with
any
degree
of
confidence
my
dress
and
behaviour
were
of
the
same
anomalous
description
i
wore
my
hair
long
and
indulged
probably
in
an
refinement
of
manner
in
a
word
i
was
eccentric
and
could
not
fit
myself
into
everyday
life
like
the
ordinary
man
at
this
time
babu
akshay
sarkar
had
started
his
monthly
review
the
new
life
to
which
i
used
occasionally
to
contribute
bankim
babu
had
just
closed
the
chapter
of
his
editorship
of
the
the
mirror
of
bengal
and
was
busy
with
religious
discussions
for
which
purpose
he
had
started
the
monthly
the
preacher
to
this
also
i
contributed
a
song
or
two
and
an
effusive
appreciation
of
lyrics
from
now
i
began
constantly
to
meet
bankim
babu
he
was
then
living
in
bhabani
dutt
street
i
used
to
visit
him
frequently
it
is
true
but
there
was
not
much
of
conversation
i
was
then
of
the
age
to
listen
not
to
talk
i
fervently
wished
we
could
warm
up
into
some
discussion
but
my
diffidence
got
the
better
of
my
conversational
powers
some
days
sanjib
babu
would
be
there
reclining
on
his
bolster
the
sight
would
gladden
me
for
he
was
a
genial
soul
he
delighted
in
talking
and
it
was
a
delight
to
listen
to
his
talk
those
who
have
read
his
prose
writing
must
have
noticed
how
gaily
and
airily
it
flows
on
like
the
sprightliest
of
conversation
very
few
have
this
gift
of
conversation
and
fewer
still
the
art
of
translating
it
into
writing
this
was
the
time
when
pandit
sashadhar
rose
into
prominence
of
him
i
first
heard
from
bankim
babu
if
i
remember
right
bankim
babu
was
also
responsible
for
introducing
him
to
the
public
the
curious
attempt
made
by
hindu
orthodoxy
to
revive
its
prestige
with
the
help
of
western
science
soon
spread
all
over
the
country
theosophy
for
some
time
previously
had
been
preparing
the
ground
for
such
a
movement
not
that
bankim
babu
even
thoroughly
identified
himself
with
this
cult
no
shadow
of
sashadhar
was
cast
on
his
exposition
of
hinduism
as
it
found
expression
in
the
that
was
impossible
i
was
then
coming
out
of
the
seclusion
of
my
corner
as
my
contributions
to
these
controversies
will
show
some
of
these
were
satirical
verses
some
farcical
plays
others
letters
to
newspapers
i
thus
came
down
into
the
arena
from
the
regions
of
sentiment
and
began
to
spar
in
right
earnest
in
the
heat
of
the
fight
i
happened
to
fall
foul
of
bankim
babu
the
history
of
this
remains
recorded
in
the
and
of
those
days
and
need
not
be
repeated
here
at
the
close
of
this
period
of
antagonism
bankim
babu
wrote
me
a
letter
which
i
have
unfortunately
lost
had
it
been
here
the
reader
could
have
seen
with
what
consummate
generosity
bankim
babu
had
taken
the
sting
out
of
that
unfortunate
episode
part
viii
steamer
lured
by
an
advertisement
in
some
paper
my
brother
jyotirindra
went
off
one
afternoon
to
an
auction
sale
and
on
his
return
informed
us
that
he
had
bought
a
steel
hulk
for
seven
thousand
rupees
all
that
now
remained
being
to
put
in
an
engine
and
some
cabins
for
it
to
become
a
steamer
my
brother
must
have
thought
it
a
great
shame
that
our
countrymen
should
have
their
tongues
and
pens
going
but
not
a
single
line
of
steamers
as
i
have
narrated
before
he
had
tried
to
light
matches
for
his
country
but
no
amount
of
rubbing
availed
to
make
them
strike
he
had
also
wanted
to
work
but
after
all
his
travail
only
one
little
country
towel
was
born
and
then
the
loom
stopped
and
now
that
he
wanted
indian
steamers
to
ply
he
bought
an
empty
old
hulk
which
in
due
course
was
filled
not
only
with
engines
and
cabins
but
with
loss
and
ruin
as
well
and
yet
we
should
remember
that
all
the
loss
and
hardship
due
to
his
endeavours
fell
on
him
alone
while
the
gain
of
experience
remained
in
reserve
for
the
whole
country
it
is
these
uncalculating
unbusinesslike
spirits
who
keep
the
of
the
country
flooded
with
their
activities
and
though
the
flood
subsides
as
rapidly
as
it
comes
it
leaves
behind
fertilising
silt
to
enrich
the
soil
when
the
time
for
reaping
arrives
no
one
thinks
of
these
pioneers
but
those
who
have
cheerfully
staked
and
lost
their
all
during
life
are
not
likely
after
death
to
mind
this
further
loss
of
being
forgotten
on
one
side
was
the
european
flotilla
company
on
the
other
my
brother
jyotirindra
alone
and
how
tremendous
waxed
that
battle
of
the
mercantile
fleets
the
people
of
khulna
and
barisal
may
still
remember
under
the
stress
of
competition
steamer
was
added
to
steamer
loss
piled
on
loss
while
the
income
dwindled
till
it
ceased
to
be
worth
while
to
print
tickets
the
golden
age
dawned
on
the
steamer
service
between
khulna
and
barisal
not
only
were
the
passengers
carried
free
of
charge
but
they
were
offered
light
refreshments
as
well
then
was
formed
a
band
of
volunteers
who
with
flags
and
patriotic
songs
marched
the
passengers
in
procession
to
the
indian
line
of
steamers
so
while
there
was
no
want
of
passengers
to
carry
every
other
kind
of
want
began
to
multiply
apace
illustration
my
brother
jyotirindra
arithmetic
remained
uninfluenced
by
patriotic
fervour
and
while
enthusiasm
flamed
higher
and
higher
to
the
tune
of
patriotic
songs
three
times
three
went
on
steadily
making
nine
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
balance
sheet
one
of
the
misfortunes
which
always
pursues
the
unbusinesslike
is
that
while
they
are
as
easy
to
read
as
an
open
book
they
never
learn
to
read
the
character
of
others
and
since
it
takes
them
the
whole
of
their
lifetime
and
all
their
resources
to
find
out
this
weakness
of
theirs
they
never
get
the
chance
of
profiting
by
experience
while
the
passengers
were
having
free
refreshments
the
staff
showed
no
signs
of
being
starved
either
but
nevertheless
the
greatest
gain
remained
with
my
brother
in
the
ruin
he
so
valiantly
faced
the
daily
bulletins
of
victory
or
disaster
which
used
to
arrive
from
the
theatre
of
action
kept
us
in
a
fever
of
excitement
then
one
day
came
the
news
that
the
steamer
had
fouled
the
howrah
bridge
and
sunk
with
this
last
loss
my
brother
completely
overstepped
the
limits
of
his
resources
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wind
up
the
business
in
the
meantime
death
made
its
appearance
in
our
family
before
this
i
had
never
met
death
face
to
face
when
my
mother
died
i
was
quite
a
child
she
had
been
ailing
for
quite
a
long
time
and
we
did
not
even
know
when
her
malady
had
taken
a
fatal
turn
she
used
all
along
to
sleep
on
a
separate
bed
in
the
same
room
with
us
then
in
the
course
of
her
illness
she
was
taken
for
a
boat
trip
on
the
river
and
on
her
return
a
room
on
the
third
storey
of
the
inner
apartments
was
set
apart
for
her
on
the
night
she
died
we
were
fast
asleep
in
our
room
downstairs
at
what
hour
i
can
not
tell
our
old
nurse
came
running
in
weeping
and
crying
o
my
little
ones
you
have
lost
your
all
my
rebuked
her
and
led
her
away
to
save
us
the
sudden
shock
at
dead
of
night
half
awakened
by
her
words
i
felt
my
heart
sink
within
me
but
could
not
make
out
what
had
happened
when
in
the
morning
we
were
told
of
her
death
i
could
not
realize
all
that
it
meant
for
me
as
we
came
out
into
the
verandah
we
saw
my
mother
laid
on
a
bedstead
in
the
courtyard
there
was
nothing
in
her
appearance
which
showed
death
to
be
terrible
the
aspect
which
death
wore
in
that
morning
light
was
as
lovely
as
a
calm
and
peaceful
sleep
and
the
gulf
between
life
and
its
absence
was
not
brought
home
to
us
only
when
her
body
was
taken
out
by
the
main
gateway
and
we
followed
the
procession
to
the
cremation
ground
did
a
storm
of
grief
pass
through
me
at
the
thought
that
mother
would
never
return
by
this
door
and
take
again
her
accustomed
place
in
the
affairs
of
her
household
the
day
wore
on
we
returned
from
the
cremation
and
as
we
turned
into
our
lane
i
looked
up
at
the
house
towards
my
father
rooms
on
the
third
storey
he
was
still
in
the
front
verandah
sitting
motionless
in
prayer
she
who
was
the
youngest
of
the
house
took
charge
of
the
motherless
little
ones
she
herself
saw
to
our
food
and
clothing
and
all
other
wants
and
kept
us
constantly
near
so
that
we
might
not
feel
our
loss
too
keenly
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
living
is
the
power
to
heal
the
irreparable
to
forget
the
irreplaceable
and
in
early
life
this
power
is
strongest
so
that
no
blow
penetrates
too
deeply
no
scar
is
left
permanently
thus
the
first
shadow
of
death
which
fell
on
us
left
no
darkness
behind
it
departed
as
softly
as
it
came
only
a
shadow
when
in
later
life
i
wandered
about
like
a
madcap
at
the
first
coming
of
spring
with
a
handful
of
jessamines
tied
in
a
corner
of
my
muslin
scarf
and
as
i
stroked
my
forehead
with
the
soft
rounded
tapering
buds
the
touch
of
my
mother
fingers
would
come
back
to
me
and
i
clearly
realised
that
the
tenderness
which
dwelt
in
the
tips
of
those
lovely
fingers
was
the
very
same
as
that
which
blossoms
every
day
in
the
purity
of
these
jessamine
buds
and
that
whether
we
know
it
or
not
this
tenderness
is
on
the
earth
in
boundless
measure
the
acquaintance
which
i
made
with
death
at
the
age
of
was
a
permanent
one
and
its
blow
has
continued
to
add
itself
to
each
succeeding
bereavement
in
an
ever
lengthening
chain
of
tears
the
lightness
of
infant
life
can
skip
aside
from
the
greatest
of
calamities
but
with
age
evasion
is
not
so
easy
and
the
shock
of
that
day
i
had
to
take
full
on
my
breast
that
there
could
be
any
gap
in
the
unbroken
procession
of
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
life
was
a
thing
i
had
no
idea
of
i
could
therefore
see
nothing
beyond
and
this
life
i
had
accepted
as
all
in
all
when
of
a
sudden
death
came
and
in
a
moment
made
a
gaping
rent
in
its
fabric
i
was
utterly
bewildered
all
around
the
trees
the
soil
the
water
the
sun
the
moon
the
stars
remained
as
immovably
true
as
before
and
yet
the
person
who
was
as
truly
there
who
through
a
thousand
points
of
contact
with
life
mind
and
heart
was
ever
so
much
more
true
for
me
had
vanished
in
a
moment
like
a
dream
what
perplexing
it
all
seemed
to
me
as
i
looked
around
how
was
i
ever
to
reconcile
that
which
remained
with
that
which
had
gone
the
terrible
darkness
which
was
disclosed
to
me
through
this
rent
continued
to
attract
me
night
and
day
as
time
went
on
i
would
ever
and
anon
return
to
take
my
stand
there
and
gaze
upon
it
wondering
what
there
was
left
in
place
of
what
had
gone
emptiness
is
a
thing
man
can
not
bring
himself
to
believe
in
that
which
is
is
untrue
that
which
is
untrue
is
not
so
our
efforts
to
find
something
where
we
see
nothing
are
unceasing
just
as
a
young
plant
surrounded
by
darkness
stretches
itself
as
it
were
on
tiptoe
to
find
its
way
out
into
the
light
so
when
death
suddenly
throws
the
darkness
of
negation
round
the
soul
it
tries
and
tries
to
rise
into
the
light
of
affirmation
and
what
other
sorrow
is
comparable
to
the
state
wherein
darkness
prevents
the
finding
of
a
way
out
of
the
darkness
and
yet
in
the
midst
of
this
unbearable
grief
flashes
of
joy
seemed
to
sparkle
in
my
mind
now
and
again
in
a
way
which
quite
surprised
me
that
life
was
not
a
stable
permanent
fixture
was
itself
the
sorrowful
tidings
which
helped
to
lighten
my
mind
that
we
were
not
prisoners
for
ever
within
a
solid
stone
wall
of
life
was
the
thought
which
unconsciously
kept
coming
uppermost
in
rushes
of
gladness
that
which
i
had
held
i
was
made
to
let
go
this
was
the
sense
of
loss
which
distressed
me
but
when
at
the
same
moment
i
viewed
it
from
the
standpoint
of
freedom
gained
a
great
peace
fell
upon
me
the
pressure
of
worldly
existence
compensates
itself
by
balancing
life
against
death
and
thus
it
does
not
crush
us
the
terrible
weight
of
an
unopposed
life
force
has
not
to
be
endured
by
man
this
truth
came
upon
me
that
day
as
a
sudden
wonderful
revelation
with
the
loosening
of
the
attraction
of
the
world
the
beauty
of
nature
took
on
for
me
a
deeper
meaning
death
had
given
me
the
correct
perspective
from
which
to
perceive
the
world
in
the
fulness
of
its
beauty
and
as
i
saw
the
picture
of
the
universe
against
the
background
of
death
i
found
it
entrancing
at
this
time
i
was
attacked
with
a
recrudescence
of
eccentricity
in
thought
and
behaviour
to
be
called
upon
to
submit
to
the
customs
and
fashions
of
the
day
as
if
they
were
something
soberly
and
genuinely
real
made
me
want
to
laugh
i
not
take
them
seriously
the
burden
of
stopping
to
consider
what
other
people
might
think
of
me
was
completely
lifted
off
my
mind
i
have
been
about
in
fashionable
book
shops
with
a
coarse
sheet
draped
round
me
as
my
only
upper
garment
and
a
pair
of
slippers
on
my
bare
feet
through
hot
and
cold
and
wet
i
used
to
sleep
out
on
the
verandah
of
the
third
storey
there
the
stars
and
i
could
gaze
at
each
other
and
no
time
was
lost
in
greeting
the
dawn
this
phase
had
nothing
to
do
with
any
ascetic
feeling
it
was
more
like
a
holiday
spree
as
the
result
of
discovering
the
schoolmaster
life
with
his
cane
to
be
a
myth
and
thereby
being
able
to
shake
myself
free
from
the
petty
rules
of
his
school
if
on
waking
one
fine
morning
we
were
to
find
gravitation
reduced
to
only
a
fraction
of
itself
would
we
still
demurely
walk
along
the
high
road
would
we
not
rather
skip
over
houses
for
a
change
or
on
encountering
the
monument
take
a
flying
jump
rather
than
trouble
to
walk
round
it
that
was
why
with
the
weight
of
worldly
life
no
longer
clogging
my
feet
i
could
not
stick
to
the
usual
course
of
convention
alone
on
the
terrace
in
the
darkness
of
night
i
groped
all
over
like
a
blind
man
trying
to
find
upon
the
black
stone
gate
of
death
some
device
or
sign
then
when
i
woke
with
the
morning
light
falling
on
that
unscreened
bed
of
mine
i
felt
as
i
opened
my
eyes
that
my
enveloping
haze
was
becoming
transparent
and
as
on
the
clearing
of
the
mist
the
hills
and
rivers
and
forests
of
the
scene
shine
forth
so
the
picture
of
the
spread
out
before
me
seemed
to
become
renewed
and
ever
so
beautiful
rains
and
according
to
the
hindu
calendar
each
year
is
ruled
by
a
particular
planet
so
have
i
found
that
in
each
period
of
life
a
particular
season
assumes
a
special
importance
when
i
look
back
to
my
childhood
i
can
best
recall
the
rainy
days
the
rain
has
flooded
the
verandah
floor
the
row
of
doors
leading
into
the
rooms
are
all
closed
peari
the
old
scullery
maid
is
coming
from
the
market
her
basket
laden
with
vegetables
wading
through
the
slush
and
drenched
with
the
rain
and
for
no
rhyme
or
reason
i
am
careering
about
the
verandah
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
this
also
comes
back
to
me
i
am
at
school
our
class
is
held
in
a
colonnade
with
mats
as
outer
screens
cloud
upon
cloud
has
come
up
during
the
afternoon
and
they
are
now
heaped
up
covering
the
sky
and
as
we
look
on
the
rain
comes
down
in
close
thick
showers
the
thunder
at
intervals
rumbling
long
and
loud
some
mad
woman
with
nails
of
lightning
seems
to
be
rending
the
sky
from
end
to
end
the
mat
walls
tremble
under
the
blasts
of
wind
as
if
they
would
be
blown
in
we
can
hardly
see
to
read
for
the
darkness
the
pandit
gives
us
leave
to
close
our
books
then
leaving
the
storm
to
do
the
romping
and
roaring
for
us
we
keep
swinging
our
dangling
legs
and
my
mind
goes
right
away
across
the
unending
moor
through
which
the
prince
of
the
fairy
tale
passes
i
remember
moreover
the
depth
of
the
nights
the
pattering
of
the
rain
finding
its
way
through
the
gaps
of
my
slumber
creates
within
a
gladsome
restfulness
deeper
than
the
deepest
sleep
and
in
the
wakeful
intervals
i
pray
that
the
morning
may
see
the
rain
continue
our
lane
under
water
and
the
bathing
platform
of
the
tank
submerged
to
the
last
step
but
at
the
age
of
which
i
have
just
been
telling
autumn
is
on
the
throne
beyond
all
doubt
its
life
is
to
be
seen
spread
under
the
clear
transparent
leisure
of
and
in
the
molten
gold
of
this
autumn
sunshine
softly
reflected
from
the
fresh
dewy
green
outside
i
am
pacing
the
verandah
and
composing
in
the
mode
the
song
in
this
morning
light
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
that
my
heart
desires
the
autumn
day
wears
on
the
house
gong
sounds
noon
the
mode
changes
though
my
mind
is
still
filled
with
music
leaving
no
room
for
call
of
work
or
duty
and
i
sing
what
idle
play
is
this
with
yourself
my
heart
through
the
listless
hours
then
in
the
afternoon
i
am
lying
on
the
white
floorcloth
of
my
little
room
with
a
drawing
book
trying
to
draw
pictures
by
no
means
an
arduous
pursuit
of
the
pictorial
muse
but
just
a
toying
with
the
desire
to
make
pictures
the
most
important
part
is
that
which
remains
in
the
mind
and
of
which
not
a
line
gets
drawn
on
the
paper
and
in
the
meantime
the
serene
autumn
afternoon
is
filtering
through
the
walls
of
this
little
calcutta
room
filling
it
as
a
cup
with
golden
intoxication
i
know
not
why
but
all
my
days
of
that
period
i
see
as
if
through
this
autumn
sky
this
autumn
light
the
autumn
which
ripened
for
me
my
songs
as
it
ripens
the
corn
for
the
tillers
the
autumn
which
filled
my
granary
of
leisure
with
radiance
the
autumn
which
flooded
my
unburdened
mind
with
an
unreasoning
joy
in
fashioning
song
and
story
the
great
difference
which
i
see
between
the
of
my
childhood
and
the
autumn
of
my
youth
is
that
in
the
former
it
is
outer
nature
which
closely
hemmed
me
in
keeping
me
entertained
with
its
numerous
troupe
its
variegated
its
medley
of
music
while
the
festivity
which
goes
on
in
the
shining
light
of
autumn
is
in
man
himself
the
play
of
cloud
and
sunshine
is
left
in
the
background
while
the
murmurs
of
joy
and
sorrow
occupy
the
mind
it
is
our
gaze
which
gives
to
the
blue
of
the
autumn
sky
its
wistful
tinge
and
human
yearning
which
gives
poignancy
to
the
breath
of
its
breezes
my
poems
have
now
come
to
the
doors
of
men
here
informal
goings
and
comings
are
not
allowed
there
is
door
after
door
chamber
within
chamber
how
many
times
have
we
to
return
with
only
a
glimpse
of
the
light
in
the
window
only
the
sound
of
the
pipes
from
within
the
palace
gates
lingering
in
our
ears
mind
has
to
treat
with
mind
will
to
come
to
terms
with
will
through
many
tortuous
obstructions
before
giving
and
taking
can
come
about
the
foundation
of
life
as
it
dashes
into
these
obstacles
splashes
and
foams
over
in
laughter
and
tears
and
dances
and
whirls
through
eddies
from
which
one
can
not
get
a
definite
idea
of
its
course
and
and
is
a
serenade
from
the
streets
in
front
of
the
dwelling
of
man
a
plea
to
be
allowed
an
entry
and
a
place
within
that
house
of
mystery
this
world
is
sweet
i
do
not
want
to
die
i
wish
to
dwell
in
the
life
of
man
this
is
the
prayer
of
the
individual
to
the
universal
life
when
i
started
for
my
second
voyage
to
england
i
made
the
acquaintance
on
board
ship
of
asutosh
chaudhuri
he
had
just
taken
the
degree
of
the
calcutta
university
and
was
on
his
way
to
england
to
join
the
bar
we
were
together
only
during
the
few
days
the
steamer
took
from
calcutta
to
madras
but
it
became
quite
evident
that
depth
of
friendship
does
not
depend
upon
length
of
acquaintance
within
this
short
time
he
so
drew
me
to
him
by
his
simple
natural
qualities
of
heart
that
the
previous
gap
in
our
acquaintance
seemed
always
to
have
been
filled
with
our
friendship
when
ashu
came
back
from
england
he
became
one
of
us
he
had
not
as
yet
had
time
or
opportunity
to
pierce
through
all
the
barriers
with
which
his
profession
is
hedged
in
and
so
become
completely
immersed
in
it
the
of
his
clients
had
not
yet
sufficiently
loosened
the
strings
which
held
their
gold
and
ashu
was
still
an
enthusiast
in
gathering
honey
from
various
gardens
of
literature
the
spirit
of
literature
which
then
saturated
his
being
had
nothing
of
the
mustiness
of
library
morocco
about
it
but
was
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
unknown
exotics
from
over
the
seas
at
his
invitation
i
enjoyed
many
a
picnic
amidst
the
spring
time
of
those
distant
woodlands
he
had
a
special
taste
for
the
flavour
of
french
literature
i
was
then
writing
the
poems
which
came
to
be
published
in
the
volume
entitled
o
sharps
and
flats
ashu
could
discern
resemblances
between
many
of
my
poems
and
old
french
poems
he
knew
according
to
him
the
common
element
in
all
these
poems
was
the
attraction
which
the
play
of
had
for
the
poet
and
this
had
found
varied
expression
in
each
and
every
one
of
them
the
unfulfilled
desire
to
enter
into
this
larger
life
was
the
fundamental
motive
throughout
i
will
arrange
and
publish
these
poems
for
you
said
ashu
and
accordingly
that
task
was
entrusted
to
him
the
poem
beginning
world
is
was
the
one
he
considered
to
be
the
keynote
of
the
whole
series
and
so
he
placed
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
volume
ashu
was
very
possibly
right
when
in
childhood
i
was
confined
to
the
house
i
offered
my
heart
in
my
wistful
gaze
to
outside
nature
in
all
its
variety
through
the
openings
in
the
parapet
of
our
inner
in
my
youth
the
world
of
men
in
the
same
way
exerted
a
powerful
attraction
on
me
to
that
also
i
was
then
an
outsider
and
looked
out
upon
it
from
the
roadside
my
mind
standing
on
the
brink
called
out
as
it
were
with
an
eager
waving
of
hands
to
the
ferryman
sailing
away
across
the
waves
to
the
other
side
for
life
longed
to
start
on
life
journey
it
is
not
true
that
my
peculiarly
isolated
social
condition
was
the
bar
to
my
plunging
into
the
midst
of
the
i
see
no
sign
that
those
of
my
countrymen
who
have
been
all
their
lives
in
the
thick
of
society
feel
any
more
than
i
did
the
touch
of
its
living
intimacy
the
life
of
our
country
has
its
high
banks
and
its
flight
of
steps
and
on
its
dark
waters
falls
the
cool
shade
of
the
ancient
trees
while
from
within
the
leafy
branches
the
cooes
forth
its
ravishing
song
but
for
all
that
it
is
stagnant
water
where
is
its
current
where
are
the
waves
when
does
the
high
tide
rush
in
from
the
sea
did
i
then
get
from
the
neighbourhood
on
the
other
side
of

pæan
with
which
the
river
falling

rising
wave

cuts
its
way
through

stone
to
the
sea
no
my
life
in
its
solitude
was
simply
fretting
for
want
of
an
invitation
to
the
place
where
the
festival
of
was
being
held
man
is
overcome
by
a
profound
depression
while
nodding
through
his
voluptuously
lazy
hours
of
seclusion
because
in
this
way
he
is
deprived
of
full
commerce
with
life
such
is
the
despondency
from
which
i
have
always
painfully
struggled
to
get
free
my
mind
refused
to
respond
to
the
cheap
intoxication
of
the
political
movements
of
those
days
devoid
as
they
seemed
of
all
strength
of
national
consciousness
with
their
complete
ignorance
of
the
country
their
supreme
indifference
to
real
service
of
the
motherland
i
was
tormented
by
a
furious
impatience
an
intolerable
dissatisfaction
with
myself
and
all
around
me
much
rather
i
said
to
myself
would
i
be
an
arab
bedouin
while
in
other
parts
of
the
world
there
is
no
end
to
the
movement
and
clamour
of
the
revelry
of
free
life
we
like
the
beggar
maid
stand
outside
and
longingly
look
on
when
have
we
had
the
wherewithal
to
deck
ourselves
for
the
occasion
and
go
and
join
in
it
only
in
a
country
where
the
spirit
of
separation
reigns
supreme
and
innumerable
petty
barriers
divide
one
from
another
need
this
longing
to
realise
the
larger
life
of
the
world
in
one
own
remain
unsatisfied
i
strained
with
the
same
yearning
towards
the
world
of
men
in
my
youth
as
i
did
in
my
childhood
towards
outside
nature
from
within
the
drawn
round
me
by
the
servants
how
rare
how
unattainable
how
far
away
it
seemed
and
yet
if
we
can
not
get
into
touch
with
it
if
from
it
no
breeze
can
blow
no
current
come
if
no
road
be
there
for
the
free
goings
and
comings
of
travellers
then
the
dead
things
that
accumulate
around
us
never
get
removed
but
continue
to
be
heaped
up
till
they
smother
all
life
during
the
rains
there
are
only
dark
clouds
and
showers
and
in
the
autumn
there
is
the
play
of
light
and
shade
in
the
sky
but
that
is
not
for
there
is
also
the
promise
of
corn
in
the
fields
so
in
my
poetical
career
when
the
rainy
season
was
in
the
ascendant
there
were
only
my
vaporous
fancies
which
stormed
and
showered
my
utterance
was
misty
my
verses
were
wild
and
with
the
and
of
my
autumn
not
only
was
there
the
play
of
in
the
sky
but
out
of
the
ground
crops
were
to
be
seen
rising
then
in
the
commerce
with
the
world
of
reality
both
language
and
metre
attempted
definiteness
and
variety
of
form
thus
ends
another
book
the
days
of
coming
together
of
inside
and
outside
kin
and
stranger
are
closing
in
upon
my
life
my
journey
has
now
to
be
completed
through
the
dwelling
places
of
men
and
the
good
and
evil
joy
and
sorrow
which
it
thus
encountered
are
not
to
be
lightly
viewed
as
pictures
what
makings
and
breakings
victories
and
defeats
clashings
and
minglings
are
here
going
on
i
have
not
the
power
to
disclose
and
display
the
supreme
art
with
which
the
guide
of
my
life
is
joyfully
leading
me
through
all
its
obstacles
antagonisms
and
crookednesses
towards
the
fulfilment
of
its
innermost
meaning
and
if
i
can
not
make
clear
all
the
mystery
of
this
design
whatever
else
i
may
try
to
show
is
sure
to
prove
misleading
at
every
step
to
analyse
the
image
is
only
to
get
at

with
a
mind
universal
as
the

writes
of
course
from
the
standpoint
of
the
hindu
but
strange
to
say
his
spirit
and
teaching
come
nearer
to
jesus
as
we
find
him
in
the
gospels
than
any
modern
christian
writer
i
know
he
does
for
the
average
reader
what
bergson
and
eucken
are
doing
for

he
rescues
the
soul
and
its
faculties
from

the
way
back
to
nature
and
her
spiritual
voices

rebukes
our
materialistic
western
life
with
the
dignity
and
authority
of
one
of
the
old
hebrew
prophets
he
opens
up
the
meaning
of
life

makes
us

redeeming
fact
that
life
is
tremendous
