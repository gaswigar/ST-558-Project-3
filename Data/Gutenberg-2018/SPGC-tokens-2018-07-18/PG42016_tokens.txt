the
mystery
of
the
old
dredge
marian
norton
started
took
one
step
backward
then
stood
staring
startled
by
this
sudden
action
the
spotted
reindeer
behind
her
lunged
backward
to
blunder
into
the
brown
one
that
followed
him
and
this
one
was
in
turn
thrown
against
a
white
one
that
followed
the
two
this
set
all
three
of
them
into
such
a
general
that
it
was
a
full
minute
before
the
girl
could
get
them
quieted
and
could
again
allow
her
eyes
to
seek
the
object
of
her
alarm
as
she
stood
there
her
pulse
quickened
her
cheeks
flushed
and
she
felt
an
all
but
irresistible
desire
to
turn
and
flee
yet
she
held
her
ground
had
she
seen
a
flash
of
purple
flame
she
had
thought
so
it
had
appeared
to
shoot
out
from
the
side
of
the
dark
bulk
that
lay
just
before
her
might
have
been
my
nerves
she
told
herself
perhaps
my
eyes
are
seeing
things
t
wouldn
t
be
strange
i
came
a
long
way
she
come
a
long
way
over
the
arctic
tundra
that
day
starting
but
two
mornings
before
from
her
reindeer
herd
close
to
a
hundred
miles
from
nome
alaska
she
had
covered
fully
of
that
distance
in
two
days
her
way
had
lead
over
low
hills
across
streams
whose
waters
ran
clear
and
cold
toward
the
sea
down
broad
stretches
of
tundra
whose
soft
mosses
had
oozed
moisture
at
her
every
step
here
a
young
widgeon
duck
ready
to
begin
his
southward
this
was
the
arctic
s
autumn
stretched
his
long
neck
to
stare
at
her
here
a
mother
white
fox
had
at
her
insolently
and
unafraid
here
she
had
paused
to
pick
a
handful
of
pink
salmon
berries
or
to
admire
a
particularly
brilliant
array
of
wild
flowers
which
but
for
her
passing
might
have
been
born
to
blush
unseen
and
waste
their
fragrance
on
the
desert
yet
always
with
the
three
reindeers
at
her
heels
she
had
pressed
onward
toward
nome
the
port
and
metropolis
of
all
that
vast
north
country
the
black
bulk
that
loomed
out
of
the
darkness
before
her
was
a
deserted
dredging
scow
grounded
on
a
sand
bar
of
the
sinrock
river
at
least
she
had
thought
the
scow
deserted
until
now
she
had
believed
and
hoped
that
here
she
might
spend
the
night
completing
her
journey
on
the
morrow
but
now
she
breathed
yes
yes
there
can
be
no
mistake
there
it
is
sinking
wearily
down
upon
the
damp
grass
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
she
was
so
tired
she
could
cry
yet
she
must
mush
on
through
the
dark
over
the
soft
oozing
tundra
for
fifteen
more
weary
miles
fifteen
miles
further
down
the
river
was
the
sinrock
mission
here
she
might
hope
to
find
a
corral
for
her
deer
and
food
and
rest
for
herself
marian
did
not
cry
born
and
bred
in
the
arctic
she
was
made
of
such
stern
stuff
as
the
arctic
wilderness
and
the
arctic
blizzard
alone
can
mould
she
did
not
mean
to
take
chances
with
the
occupants
of
the
old
dredge
there
was
something
mysterious
and
uncanny
about
that
purple
flame
which
she
now
saw
shoot
straight
out
a
full
two
feet
to
instantly
disappear
she
had
seen
nothing
like
it
before
in
the
arctic
as
she
studied
the
outlines
of
the
dredge
she
realized
that
the
light
was
within
it
that
it
flashed
across
a
small
square
window
in
the
side
of
the
old
scow
no
she
reasoned
i
can
t
afford
to
take
chances
with
them
i
must
go
on
down
the
river
i
can
make
speaking
to
her
reindeer
she
tugged
at
their
lead
straps
one
at
a
time
they
started
forward
until
at
last
they
again
took
up
the
weary
across
the
tundra
once
marian
turned
to
look
back
again
she
caught
the
flash
of
a
purple
flame
had
she
known
how
this
purple
flame
was
to
be
mixed
up
with
her
own
destiny
she
might
have
paused
to
look
longer
as
it
was
she
gave
herself
over
to
wondering
what
sort
of
people
would
take
up
their
habitation
in
that
half
dredge
and
what
their
weird
light
might
signify
she
had
heard
of
the
strange
rites
performed
by
those
interesting
the
eskimos
in
the
worship
of
the
spirits
of
dead
animals
for
one
of
these
the
bladder
festival
they
saved
all
the
bladders
of
polar
bears
walrus
and
seals
which
they
had
killed
and
at
last
after
four
days
of
ceremony
committed
them
again
to
the
waters
of
the
ocean
they
burn
wild
parsnip
stalks
in
that
festival
marian
mused
but
that
purple
flame
was
not
made
by
burning
weeds
it
was
the
brilliant
flame
of
a
furnace
flaring
up
or
something
like
that
probably
wasn
t
eskimo
at
all
it
may
be
some
orientals
who
have
stolen
away
up
here
to
worship
their
idols
by
burning
strange
she
thought
of
all
the
foreign
people
who
had
crossed
the
pacific
to
take
up
their
homes
in
the
far
north
city
of
nome
which
was
just
forty
miles
away
japanese
chinese
koreans
russians
and
members
of
nameless
tribes
she
whispered
to
herself
as
if
half
afraid
they
might
hear
her
might
be
any
of
these
suddenly
she
broke
off
her
thinking
and
stopped
short
just
before
her
a
form
loomed
out
of
the
dark
another
and
yet
another
appeared
for
a
moment
she
stood
there
rigid
scarcely
breathing
then
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
reindeer
she
exclaimed
i
was
frightened
by
some
reindeer
oh
well
she
said
after
a
moment
s
reflection
i
might
excuse
myself
for
that
i
m
tired
out
with
marching
over
this
soggy
tundra
besides
i
guess
that
purple
flame
got
on
my
nerves
all
the
same
she
avowed
stoutly
i
ll
solve
that
mystery
yet
see
if
i
don
there
for
the
time
the
subject
was
dismissed
the
presence
of
these
few
reindeer
before
her
told
of
more
not
far
away
a
whole
herd
of
them
where
there
were
reindeer
there
would
be
herders
and
herders
lived
in
tents
here
there
would
be
a
warm
dry
place
to
rest
and
sleep
must
be
the
sinrock
herd
she
concluded
in
this
she
was
right
soon
off
in
the
distance
she
caught
the
yellow
glow
of
candlelight
shining
through
a
tent
wall
fifteen
minutes
later
she
was
seated
upon
a
sleeping
bag
chatting
gayly
with
two
eskimo
girls
who
were
keeping
their
brothers
tents
while
those
worthies
were
out
looking
for
some
stray
fauns
after
her
three
reindeers
had
been
relieved
of
their
packs
and
set
free
to
graze
marian
had
dined
on
hardtack
and
juicy
reindeer
chops
then
she
crawled
deep
down
into
her
soft
reindeer
skin
sleeping
bag
to
snatch
a
few
hours
of
rest
before
resuming
her
journey
to
nome
before
her
eyelids
closed
in
sleep
her
tireless
brain
went
over
the
problem
before
her
and
the
purpose
of
her
fatiguing
journey
she
had
come
all
this
way
to
meet
a
relative
whom
she
had
never
cousin
patsy
martin
from
louisville
kentucky
kentucky
she
whispered
the
word
for
the
hundredth
time
way
down
south
imagine
a
girl
who
was
brought
up
down
there
coming
here
for
a
winter
to
endure
our
cold
snow
and
blizzards
she
s
probably
slim
willowy
and
tender
as
a
baby
dresses
in
thin
silks
and
all
that
why
did
father
send
her
up
here
looks
like
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
four
hundred
reindeer
to
herd
without
having
a
sixteen
year
old
cousin
from
to
look
she
yawned
sleepily
yet
her
mind
went
on
thinking
of
her
reindeer
herd
and
her
problems
though
she
had
lived
all
but
one
year
of
her
life
in
the
far
north
she
had
never
until
two
months
before
spent
a
single
night
in
a
reindeer
herder
s
camp
but
it
was
no
longer
a
novel
experience
until
recently
her
father
had
been
a
prosperous
merchant
in
nome
financial
reverses
had
come
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
sell
his
store
the
reindeer
herd
which
he
had
taken
as
payment
for
a
debt
was
the
only
wealth
he
had
saved
from
the
crash
following
this
his
doctor
had
ordered
him
to
leave
the
rigorous
climate
of
the
north
and
to
seek
renewed
health
in
the
states
much
as
he
regretted
it
he
had
been
obliged
to
ask
his
daughter
to
give
up
her
studies
and
to
take
charge
of
the
herd
until
a
favorable
opportunity
came
for
selling
it
and
that
won
t
be
soon
i
guess
marian
sighed
reindeer
herds
are
a
drug
on
the
market
trouble
is
it
s
too
hard
to
dispose
of
the
meat
and
if
you
can
t
sell
reindeer
meat
you
can
t
make
any
money
now
added
to
this
comes
this
cousin
patsy
her
father
had
written
that
patsy
was
given
to
and
that
martin
her
uncle
thinking
that
a
year
in
the
northern
wilds
would
do
her
good
had
asked
permission
to
send
her
up
to
be
with
marian
marian
s
father
had
consented
and
patsy
was
due
on
the
next
boat
she
ll
be
company
for
you
her
father
had
written
i
do
wonder
if
she
will
marian
sighed
again
oh
well
no
use
to
be
a
pessimist
and
at
that
she
turned
over
and
fell
asleep
it
was
a
surprised
marian
who
three
days
later
found
herself
caught
in
the
firm
embrace
of
her
cousin
patsy
patsy
was
two
years
younger
than
marian
there
could
be
no
missing
the
fact
that
she
was
much
slimmer
and
more
graceful
and
that
there
was
strength
in
her
slender
arms
was
testified
to
by
her
warm
embrace
when
at
last
marian
got
a
look
at
patsy
s
face
she
found
it
almost
as
brown
as
her
own
and
as
for
freckles
there
could
scarcely
have
been
a
greater
number
on
one
person
s
face
her
mouth
too
had
lines
that
marian
liked
it
was
a
firm
determined
little
mouth
that
said
when
i
have
a
hill
to
climb
i
up
never
had
marian
beheld
such
a
wealth
of
color
as
was
displayed
in
patsy
s
winter
wardrobe
orange
and
red
sweaters
great
broad
scarfs
of
mixed
grays
gay
tams
short
plaid
skirts
heavy
brown
corduroy
knickers
these
and
many
other
garments
of
exquisite
workmanship
and
design
were
spread
out
before
her
and
the
fun
of
it
all
is
giggled
patsy
we
re
going
to
play
we
re
twins
and
wear
one
another
s
clothes
you
ve
got
a
spotted
fawnskin
parka
i
know
you
have
i
m
going
to
wear
that
right
afternoon
going
to
have
my
picture
taken
in
it
and
send
it
back
to
my
school
all
right
agreed
marian
you
can
have
anything
i
own
i
m
heavier
than
you
are
but
arctic
clothing
doesn
t
fit
very
tight
so
i
guess
it
will
be
all
as
if
to
clinch
the
bargain
she
wound
an
orange
colored
scarf
about
her
neck
and
went
strutting
across
the
room
a
half
hour
later
while
patsy
was
out
having
her
picture
taken
marian
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
room
she
was
thinking
and
her
thoughts
were
long
long
thoughts
i
like
her
she
said
at
last
i
m
going
to
like
her
more
and
more
but
it
s
going
to
be
hard
for
her
sometimes
fearfully
hard
when
the
blizzards
sweep
in
from
the
north
and
we
re
all
shut
in
when
no
one
comes
and
no
one
goes
and
the
nights
are
twenty
hours
long
when
the
dogs
howl
their
lonesome
s
going
to
be
hard
for
her
then
but
i
ll
do
the
best
i
can
for
her
her
father
was
will
do
her
a
world
of
good
it
will
teach
her
the
slow
and
steady
patience
of
those
who
live
in
the
north
and
that
s
a
good
thing
to
three
weeks
later
the
two
girls
toiling
wearily
along
after
two
reindeer
sleds
approached
the
black
bulk
of
the
old
scow
in
the
river
the
one
in
which
marian
had
seen
the
mysterious
purple
flame
again
it
was
night
they
were
on
their
way
north
to
the
reindeer
herd
traveling
over
the
first
soft
snow
of
winter
they
had
made
twenty
miles
that
day
for
the
last
hour
patsy
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
she
had
tramped
doggedly
after
the
sled
only
her
drooping
shoulders
told
how
weary
she
was
marian
had
hoped
against
hope
that
they
would
this
time
find
the
old
dredge
deserted
it
would
make
a
nice
dry
place
to
camp
she
said
to
herself
as
she
brought
her
reindeer
to
a
halt
and
stood
studying
the
dark
bulk
patsy
dropped
wearily
down
upon
a
loaded
sled
just
as
marian
was
about
to
give
the
word
to
go
forward
there
flashed
across
the
square
window
a
jet
of
purple
flame
oh
exclaimed
marian
what
is
it
asked
patsy
the
purple
flame
the
purple
flame
what
s
that
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
only
i
know
it
s
there
in
that
old
dredge
and
since
it
s
there
we
can
t
stop
here
for
the
night
we
must
go
oh
i
can
t
patsy
half
sobbed
you
don
t
know
you
can
t
know
how
tired
i
yes
i
know
said
marian
softly
i
ve
been
just
that
way
but
we
dare
not
stop
here
the
people
in
the
old
scow
might
have
dogs
and
they
would
attack
our
reindeer
we
must
go
on
five
miles
and
camp
beneath
the
all
right
said
patsy
with
a
burst
of
determination
let
s
get
it
over
again
they
moved
slowly
forward
but
neither
of
them
forgot
the
purple
flame
three
times
they
saw
it
flash
across
the
window
that
place
must
be
haunted
marian
sighed
as
she
turned
to
give
her
full
attention
to
the
lagging
reindeer
chapter
ii
patsy
from
kentucky
some
five
miles
from
the
old
dredge
marian
stopped
her
reindeer
gazed
about
her
for
a
moment
then
said
quietly
we
ll
camp
here
cried
patsy
won
t
we
freeze
freeze
no
we
ll
be
safe
as
a
bug
in
a
rug
just
you
sit
down
on
a
sled
until
i
unpack
this
one
after
that
i
ll
picket
out
the
reindeer
and
get
from
the
sled
marian
dragged
a
sheet
iron
affair
which
she
called
a
yukon
stove
with
dry
moss
dug
from
beneath
the
snow
and
wood
brought
on
the
sled
she
kindled
a
fire
they
had
no
shelter
but
the
glow
of
the
fire
cheered
patsy
immeasurably
when
the
smell
of
frying
bacon
and
warming
red
beans
reached
her
she
was
ready
to
execute
a
little
dance
of
joy
supper
over
marian
took
a
small
trench
shovel
salvaged
by
a
friend
from
the
great
war
and
scraped
away
the
snow
from
above
the
soft
dry
tundra
moss
over
this
cleared
space
she
spread
a
square
of
canvas
then
untying
a
thong
about
a
deerskin
sleeping
bag
she
allowed
the
bag
to
slowly
unroll
itself
along
the
canvas
there
she
announced
the
bed
is
made
no
need
to
pull
down
the
shades
we
ll
get
off
our
outer
garments
and
hop
right
patsy
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
then
seeing
her
take
off
first
her
mackinaw
then
her
sweater
she
followed
suit
now
said
marian
as
they
reached
the
proper
stage
of
disrobing
you
do
it
like
sitting
down
upon
the
canvas
she
thrust
her
feet
into
the
sleeping
bag
then
began
to
work
her
way
into
it
come
on
she
directed
we
can
do
it
best
together
it
s
just
big
enough
for
two
i
had
it
made
that
way
on
patsy
dropped
to
the
place
beside
her
then
together
they
burrowed
their
way
into
the
depths
of
the
bag
until
only
their
eyes
and
noses
were
uncovered
how
soft
murmured
patsy
as
she
wound
an
arm
about
her
cousin
s
neck
then
lay
staring
up
at
the
stars
how
warm
she
whispered
again
five
minutes
later
yes
marian
whispered
as
though
they
were
sleeping
at
home
and
might
disturb
the
household
by
speaking
aloud
you
see
this
bag
is
made
of
the
long
haired
winter
skins
of
reindeer
the
hair
is
a
solid
mat
more
than
an
inch
thick
the
skin
keeps
out
the
wind
with
the
foot
and
the
sides
of
it
sewed
up
tight
you
can
t
possibly
get
cold
even
if
you
sleep
on
the
frozen
how
wonderful
exclaimed
patsy
it
wouldn
t
be
a
bit
of
use
writing
that
to
my
friends
they
simply
wouldn
t
believe
no
they
wouldn
for
a
little
time
with
arms
twined
about
one
another
the
cousins
lay
there
in
silence
each
busy
with
her
own
thoughts
was
not
at
all
conscious
of
the
bonds
of
human
affection
which
the
vast
silence
of
the
white
wilderness
was
even
now
weaving
about
them
bonds
far
stronger
than
their
arms
about
one
another
s
neck
these
were
to
carry
them
together
through
many
a
wild
and
mysterious
adventure
as
if
in
anticipation
of
all
this
patsy
snuggled
a
bit
closer
to
marian
and
said
i
think
this
is
going
to
be
great
let
s
hope
so
marian
answered
and
will
we
really
herd
the
reindeer
no
laughed
marian
at
least
not
any
more
than
we
wish
to
you
see
we
have
three
eskimo
herders
with
us
and
attatak
a
girl
who
cooks
for
them
they
do
most
of
the
work
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
finance
the
herd
and
sort
of
supervise
it
you
see
the
eskimo
people
are
really
they
have
had
many
strange
customs
in
the
past
that
don
t
fit
now
in
their
old
village
life
of
hunting
and
fishing
it
was
an
unwritten
law
that
if
one
man
had
food
and
another
had
none
it
must
be
shared
that
won
t
work
now
there
is
only
one
time
of
year
that
we
can
get
food
into
this
herding
ground
that
is
summer
we
freight
it
up
the
river
and
store
it
for
winter
s
use
that
gives
us
a
big
supply
of
provisions
in
the
fall
there
are
two
eskimo
villages
thirty
miles
away
if
there
were
no
white
people
about
our
herders
would
share
our
supplies
with
the
villagers
as
often
as
they
came
around
before
the
winter
was
half
through
they
would
be
out
of
supplies
they
would
then
have
to
live
on
reindeer
meat
and
that
would
be
hard
on
our
herd
in
fact
we
would
soon
have
no
herd
so
that
is
the
reason
we
are
going
to
spend
a
winter
on
the
and
will
we
live
like
this
asked
patsy
oh
no
laughed
marian
we
have
tents
for
this
time
of
year
in
a
month
we
will
move
into
the
most
interesting
houses
you
ever
saw
we
ll
reserve
that
as
a
surprise
for
oh
oh
sighed
patsy
as
she
suddenly
became
conscious
of
the
aches
in
her
legs
i
think
it
s
going
to
be
grand
if
only
i
get
so
i
can
stand
the
travel
as
you
do
do
you
think
i
ever
will
of
course
you
less
than
a
you
know
said
patsy
thoughtfully
down
where
i
came
from
we
think
we
exercise
an
awful
lot
we
swim
and
row
ride
horseback
play
tennis
and
and
go
on
hikes
but
after
all
that
was
just
of
skipping
round
is
the
real
thing
giving
her
cousin
an
energetic
hug
she
closed
her
eyes
and
was
soon
fast
asleep
marian
did
not
fall
asleep
at
once
her
mind
was
working
over
the
mystery
of
the
purple
flame
what
was
it
what
had
caused
it
who
were
the
persons
back
there
in
the
old
dredge
and
why
had
they
come
there
such
were
some
of
the
problems
that
crowded
her
mind
the
old
dredge
had
been
there
for
years
it
was
but
one
of
the
many
monuments
to
men
s
folly
in
their
greedy
search
for
gold
these
derricks
crushers
smelters
and
who
knows
what
the
beaches
and
rivers
about
nome
the
bed
of
the
sinrock
river
was
known
to
run
fairly
rich
in
gold
someone
had
imagined
that
he
might
become
rich
by
dredging
the
mud
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
and
washing
it
for
gold
the
scheme
had
failed
doubtless
the
owner
of
the
dredge
had
gone
into
bankruptcy
at
any
rate
here
was
the
old
dredge
with
its
long
beams
and
gaping
iron
bucket
still
dangling
in
air
rotting
to
decay
and
here
within
this
tomblike
wreck
had
appeared
the
purple
flame
it
had
not
been
like
anything
marian
had
seen
before
almost
like
lightning
she
mused
sleepily
being
a
healthy
girl
with
a
clean
mind
she
did
not
long
puzzle
her
brain
about
the
uncanny
mystery
of
the
weird
light
but
busied
her
mind
with
more
practical
problems
if
these
makers
of
the
purple
flame
were
to
remain
long
at
the
dredge
how
were
they
to
live
too
often
in
the
past
the
answer
to
such
a
question
had
been
by
secretly
preying
upon
the
nearest
the
sinrock
herd
had
been
moved
some
distance
away
marian
s
own
herd
was
now
the
nearest
one
to
the
old
dredge
and
when
we
move
into
winter
quarters
it
will
be
five
miles
nearer
oh
well
she
sighed
there
s
no
use
borrowing
trouble
it
s
probably
some
miners
going
up
the
river
to
do
assessment
but
then
her
busy
mind
questioned
what
about
the
purple
flame
why
have
they
already
stayed
there
three
weeks
at
this
juncture
she
fell
asleep
to
awake
when
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
were
casting
fingers
of
light
across
the
snowy
tundra
she
crept
softly
from
her
sleeping
bag
jumped
into
her
clothes
and
was
in
the
act
of
lighting
the
fire
when
a
faint
sound
of
heavy
breathing
caused
her
to
turn
her
head
to
her
surprise
she
saw
patsy
clothed
only
in
those
garments
that
had
served
as
her
sleeping
gown
doing
a
strange
whirling
fling
of
calisthenics
with
the
sleeping
bag
as
her
mat
you
appear
to
have
quite
recovered
marian
laughed
just
seeing
if
i
was
all
here
patsy
laughed
in
turn
as
she
dropped
down
upon
the
bag
and
began
drawing
on
her
stockings
whew
she
puffed
that
s
invigorating
good
as
a
cold
plunge
in
the
sea
what
do
we
have
for
breakfast
flapjacks
and
maple
make
me
ten
exclaimed
patsy
redoubling
her
efforts
to
get
herself
dressed
that
night
marian
made
a
discovery
that
set
her
nerves
to
the
very
roots
of
her
hair
and
in
spite
of
the
arctic
chill
brought
beads
of
perspiration
out
on
the
tip
of
her
nose
as
on
the
previous
night
they
had
camped
out
upon
the
open
tundra
this
night
however
they
had
found
a
sheltered
spot
beside
a
clump
of
willows
that
lined
a
stream
the
stream
ran
between
low
rolling
hills
over
those
hills
they
had
been
passing
when
darkness
fell
now
as
marian
crept
into
the
sleeping
bag
she
saw
the
nearer
hills
rising
like
cathedral
domes
above
her
she
heard
the
ceaseless
rustle
of
willow
leaves
that
caught
by
an
early
frost
still
clung
to
their
branches
this
rustle
together
with
the
faint
breeze
that
fanned
her
cheeks
had
all
but
lulled
her
to
sleep
suddenly
she
sat
upright
it
couldn
t
be
she
exclaimed
then
a
moment
later
she
added
but
it
is
again
who
would
believe
it
lightning
in
the
arctic
and
on
such
a
night
as
this
twenty
below
zero
and
clear
as
a
bell
not
a
cloud
in
rubbing
her
brow
to
clear
her
mind
from
the
cobweb
of
dreams
that
had
been
forming
there
she
stared
again
at
the
crest
of
the
hill
then
swiftly
silently
that
she
might
not
waken
her
cousin
she
crept
from
the
sleeping
bag
donning
her
fur
parka
and
drawing
on
knickers
and
deerskin
boots
she
hurried
away
from
camp
and
up
the
hill
thinking
as
she
did
so
that
s
not
lightning
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
but
in
the
name
of
all
that
s
good
i
m
going
to
come
nearer
solving
that
mystery
than
ever
i
did
half
way
up
the
hill
she
found
a
snow
blown
gully
and
up
this
she
crept
half
hidden
by
the
shadows
nearing
the
crest
a
half
mile
from
her
camp
she
dropped
on
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
forward
a
hundred
yards
then
like
some
hunter
who
has
stolen
upon
his
game
she
propped
herself
on
her
elbows
and
stared
straight
ahead
in
spite
of
her
expectations
she
gasped
at
what
she
saw
a
purple
flame
now
six
inches
in
length
now
a
foot
now
two
feet
darted
out
of
space
then
receded
then
flared
up
again
three
feet
above
the
surface
of
the
snow
it
appeared
to
hang
in
midair
like
some
ghost
fire
marian
s
heart
beat
wildly
her
nerves
tingled
her
knees
trembled
and
without
the
power
to
move
she
stared
at
this
strange
apparition
this
spell
lasted
for
a
moment
then
with
a
half
audible
exclamation
of
disgust
she
dropped
limply
to
the
snow
inside
a
tent
she
said
tent
was
so
like
the
snow
and
the
sky
that
i
couldn
t
see
it
at
as
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
this
version
of
her
discovery
she
was
able
to
make
out
the
outlines
of
the
tent
and
even
to
recognize
a
dog
sleeping
beside
it
suddenly
the
shadow
of
a
person
began
dancing
on
the
wall
of
the
tent
so
rapid
were
the
flashes
of
the
purple
flame
so
flickering
and
distorted
was
this
image
that
it
seemed
more
the
shadow
of
a
ghost
than
of
a
human
being
a
second
shadow
joined
the
first
the
two
of
them
appeared
to
do
some
wild
dance
then
of
a
sudden
all
was
dark
the
purple
flame
had
vanished
a
moment
later
a
yellow
light
flared
up
then
a
steady
light
gleamed
lighted
a
candle
was
marian
s
comment
it
s
on
this
side
of
them
for
now
they
cast
no
shadows
are
they
all
men
or
are
there
some
women
how
many
are
there
two
or
more
than
two
they
are
following
us
i
d
swear
to
that
i
wonder
why
again
she
thought
of
the
stories
she
had
heard
of
ne
who
dogged
the
tracks
of
reindeer
herds
like
camp
followers
and
lived
upon
the
deer
that
had
strayed
too
far
from
the
main
herd
perhaps
marian
mused
they
have
heard
that
father
s
herd
is
to
be
run
this
winter
by
two
inexperienced
girls
perhaps
they
think
we
will
be
easy
she
set
her
lips
tight
perhaps
we
will
and
perhaps
not
we
shall
then
she
went
stealing
back
to
her
camp
and
crept
shivering
into
the
sleeping
bag
she
slept
very
little
that
night
the
camp
of
the
mysterious
strangers
was
too
close
the
perplexing
problems
that
lay
before
her
too
serious
to
permit
of
that
she
was
glad
enough
when
she
caught
the
first
faint
flush
of
dawn
in
the
east
and
knew
that
a
new
day
was
dawning
this
day
she
told
herself
we
make
our
own
camp
there
is
comfort
in
that
let
the
future
take
care
of
she
cast
one
glance
toward
the
hill
but
seeing
no
movement
there
she
began
to
search
the
ground
for
dry
moss
for
kindling
a
fire
soon
she
had
a
little
yellow
flame
glowing
in
her
yukon
stove
the
feeble
flame
soon
grew
to
a
bright
red
and
in
a
little
while
the
coffee
pot
was
singing
its
song
of
merry
defiance
to
the
arctic
chill
chapter
iii
marian
faces
a
problem
marian
buried
her
hand
in
the
thick
warm
coat
of
the
spotted
reindeer
that
stood
by
her
side
and
shading
her
eyes
gazed
away
at
the
distant
hills
a
brown
spot
had
appeared
at
the
crest
of
the
third
hill
to
her
right
there
s
another
and
another
she
said
reindeer
or
caribou
i
wonder
if
it
s
caribou
perhaps
terogloona
can
get
one
of
them
with
his
rifle
it
would
help
out
our
food
supply
but
if
it
s
her
brow
wrinkled
at
the
thought
reindeer
might
mean
at
that
instant
something
happened
that
brought
her
hand
to
her
side
quickly
unstrapping
her
field
glasses
she
put
them
to
her
eyes
a
fourth
object
had
appeared
on
the
crest
even
with
the
naked
eye
one
might
tell
that
this
one
was
not
like
the
other
three
he
was
lighter
in
color
and
lacked
the
suggestion
against
the
sky
which
meant
broad
spreading
antlers
reindeer
she
groaned
all
of
them
reindeer
and
the
last
one
s
a
sled
deer
his
antlers
have
been
cut
off
so
he
ll
travel
better
and
that
she
pursed
her
lips
in
deep
thought
as
the
furrows
in
her
brow
deepened
oh
well
she
exclaimed
at
last
perhaps
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
after
all
perhaps
they
re
just
a
bunch
of
strays
who
knows
but
a
sled
reindeer
she
argued
with
herself
they
don
t
often
stray
for
a
moment
she
stood
staring
at
the
distant
hillcrest
then
seizing
her
drive
line
she
spoke
to
her
deer
as
he
bounded
away
she
leaped
nimbly
upon
the
sled
and
went
skimming
along
after
him
we
ll
see
about
that
she
said
they
re
not
our
deer
that
s
sure
whose
are
they
that
s
what
we
re
about
to
find
out
a
circle
across
that
long
valley
then
a
stiff
climb
up
a
gully
will
just
about
bring
us
to
their
fifteen
minutes
later
she
found
herself
atop
the
first
elevation
for
the
time
out
of
sight
of
the
strange
reindeer
she
had
an
opportunity
to
glance
back
down
the
valley
where
her
own
herd
was
peacefully
feeding
her
eyes
lighted
up
as
she
looked
it
was
indeed
a
beautiful
sight
winter
had
come
for
she
and
patsy
martin
had
now
been
following
the
herd
for
three
months
winter
having
buried
deep
beneath
the
snow
every
trace
of
the
browns
and
greens
of
summer
had
left
only
deep
purple
shadows
and
pale
yellow
lights
over
mountain
hill
and
tundra
in
the
midst
of
these
lights
and
shadows
such
as
are
not
seen
save
upon
a
desert
or
the
arctic
her
little
herd
of
some
four
hundred
deer
stood
out
as
if
painted
on
a
canvas
or
done
in
with
wood
or
stone
it
s
not
like
anything
in
the
world
said
marian
and
i
love
it
oh
how
i
do
love
it
how
i
wish
i
could
paint
it
as
it
really
is
as
she
rode
on
up
the
valley
her
mind
went
over
the
months
that
had
passed
and
the
problems
she
and
patsy
now
faced
great
as
was
her
love
for
the
arctic
fond
as
she
was
of
its
wild
free
life
her
father
had
made
other
plans
for
her
plans
that
could
not
be
carried
out
so
long
as
they
were
in
possession
of
the
herd
this
seemed
to
make
the
sale
of
the
herd
an
urgent
necessity
every
letter
from
her
father
that
came
to
her
over
hundreds
of
miles
of
and
reindeer
trail
suggested
some
possible
means
of
disposing
of
the
herd
we
sell
by
spring
his
last
letter
had
said
not
that
i
am
in
immediate
need
of
money
but
you
must
get
back
to
school
one
year
out
there
in
the
wilderness
with
patsy
for
your
companion
will
do
no
harm
but
it
must
not
go
on
the
doctor
says
i
can
not
return
to
the
north
for
four
or
five
years
at
the
least
so
somehow
we
must
sell
sell
marian
repeated
almost
savagely
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
could
be
no
selling
the
herd
there
was
only
a
limited
market
for
reindeer
meat
miners
here
and
there
bought
it
the
mining
cities
bought
it
but
of
late
the
increase
to
one
hundred
thousand
reindeer
in
alaska
had
overloaded
the
market
a
little
meat
could
be
shipped
to
the
states
there
to
be
served
at
great
club
luncheons
and
in
palatial
hotels
but
the
demand
was
not
large
sell
she
questioned
how
can
we
sell
little
she
knew
how
soon
a
possible
answer
to
that
question
would
come
not
knowing
she
visioned
herself
following
the
herd
year
after
year
while
all
those
beautiful
wonderful
months
she
had
had
a
taste
of
and
now
dreamed
of
by
day
and
night
faded
from
her
thoughts
she
had
spent
one
year
under
the
shadows
of
a
great
university
marvelous
new
thoughts
had
come
to
her
that
year
friendships
had
been
made
such
friendships
as
she
in
her
northern
wilds
had
never
dreamed
of
the
stately
towers
of
the
university
even
now
appeared
to
loom
before
her
and
again
she
seemed
to
hear
the
melodious
chimes
of
the
bells
oh
she
cried
i
must
go
back
i
must
i
must
and
yet
marian
was
not
unhappy
for
the
present
she
would
not
be
any
other
place
than
where
she
was
it
was
a
charming
life
this
wandering
life
of
the
reindeer
herder
during
the
short
summer
and
even
into
the
frosts
of
fall
and
winter
they
lived
in
tents
and
like
nomads
of
the
desert
wandered
from
place
to
place
always
seeking
the
freshest
water
the
greenest
grass
the
tallest
willow
bushes
but
when
winter
truly
came
swooping
down
upon
them
they
went
to
a
spot
chosen
months
before
the
center
of
rich
feeding
grounds
where
the
ground
beneath
the
snow
was
with
reindeer
here
they
made
a
more
permanent
camp
after
that
there
remained
but
the
task
of
defending
the
herd
from
wolves
and
other
marauders
and
of
driving
the
herd
to
camp
each
day
that
they
might
not
wander
too
far
away
as
for
patsy
she
had
fairly
revelled
in
it
all
reared
in
a
city
apartment
where
a
chirping
sparrow
gave
the
only
touch
of
nature
she
had
come
to
this
wilderness
with
a
great
thirst
for
knowledge
of
the
each
day
brought
some
new
revelation
to
her
the
snow
buntings
ptarmigans
and
ravens
the
foxes
caribou
and
reindeer
even
the
occasional
prowling
wolves
all
were
her
teachers
from
them
she
learned
many
secrets
of
wild
nature
of
course
there
had
been
long
days
when
the
wind
swept
the
tundra
and
the
snow
appearing
to
rest
nowhere
whirled
on
and
on
such
days
were
lonely
ones
letters
were
weeks
in
coming
and
arrived
but
seldom
all
these
things
gave
the
energetic
city
lass
some
blue
days
but
even
then
she
never
complained
her
health
was
greatly
improved
gone
was
the
nervous
twitch
of
eyelids
that
told
of
too
many
hours
spent
pouring
over
books
the
summer
freckles
had
been
replaced
by
ruddy
brown
such
as
only
arctic
winds
and
an
occasional
freeze
can
impart
as
for
her
muscles
they
were
like
iron
bands
never
in
the
longest
day
s
tramp
did
she
complain
of
weariness
with
the
quick
adaptability
of
a
bright
and
cheerful
girl
she
had
become
a
part
of
the
wild
world
which
surrounded
her
the
expression
of
her
lips
too
was
somehow
changed
firmness
and
determination
were
still
written
there
but
certain
lines
had
been
added
lines
of
patience
that
said
louder
than
words
i
have
learned
one
great
lesson
that
one
may
run
uphill
but
that
mountains
must
be
climbed
slowly
patiently
circle
by
circle
till
the
summit
is
they
were
in
winter
camp
now
as
marian
thought
of
it
she
smiled
at
no
other
spot
in
all
alaska
was
there
another
such
camp
as
hers
marian
as
you
know
if
you
have
read
our
other
book
the
blue
envelope
had
some
two
years
before
spent
the
short
summer
months
of
the
arctic
in
siberia
across
from
alaska
much
against
her
own
wishes
she
had
spent
a
part
of
the
winter
there
someone
has
said
there
is
no
great
loss
without
some
small
gain
and
while
marian
had
endured
hardships
and
known
moments
of
peril
in
siberia
from
the
strange
and
interesting
tribes
there
she
had
learned
some
lessons
of
real
value
regarding
winter
camps
in
the
arctic
upon
making
her
own
camp
she
had
put
this
knowledge
into
practice
they
were
now
in
winter
camp
as
marian
thought
of
this
then
thought
of
the
four
strange
reindeer
on
the
ridge
above
her
brow
again
showed
wrinkles
of
anxiety
if
it
s
bill
scarberry
s
herd
she
said
fiercely
clenching
her
fists
if
it
is
in
her
words
there
was
a
world
of
feeling
in
the
early
stages
of
the
reindeer
industry
in
alaska
the
problem
of
feed
grounds
for
the
deer
had
been
exceedingly
simple
there
were
the
broad
stretches
of
tundra
a
hundred
square
miles
for
every
reindeer
help
yourself
every
mile
of
it
was
matted
deep
with
rich
moss
every
stream
lined
in
summer
with
tender
willow
leaves
if
you
chanced
to
sight
another
small
herd
in
your
wandering
you
went
to
right
or
left
and
so
avoided
them
there
was
room
for
all
now
things
were
vastly
changed
one
hundred
thousand
deer
ranged
the
tundra
reindeer
moss
eaten
away
in
a
single
season
requires
four
or
five
years
to
grow
again
in
abundance
back
back
farther
and
farther
back
from
shore
and
river
the
herds
had
been
pushed
until
now
it
was
difficult
indeed
to
transport
food
to
the
herders
with
these
conditions
arising
the
rivalry
between
owners
for
good
feeding
ground
grew
intense
many
and
bitter
were
the
feuds
that
had
arisen
between
owners
there
was
not
the
best
of
feeling
between
bill
scarberry
another
owner
and
her
father
marian
knew
that
all
too
well
and
now
maybe
his
herd
is
coming
into
our
feeding
ground
she
sighed
it
was
true
that
the
government
agent
attempted
to
allot
feeding
grounds
the
valley
her
deer
were
feeding
upon
had
been
written
down
in
his
book
as
her
winter
range
but
when
one
is
many
days
travel
from
even
the
fringe
of
civilization
when
one
is
the
herder
of
but
four
hundred
deer
and
only
a
girl
at
that
when
an
overriding
owner
of
ten
thousand
deer
comes
driving
in
his
vast
herd
to
lick
up
one
s
little
pasture
in
a
week
or
two
what
is
there
to
do
these
were
the
bitter
thoughts
that
ran
through
the
girl
s
mind
as
she
rode
up
the
valley
the
pasture
to
the
right
and
left
of
them
and
to
the
north
had
been
alloted
for
so
many
miles
that
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
think
of
breaking
winter
camp
and
freighting
supplies
to
some
new
range
no
she
said
firmly
we
are
here
and
here
we
stay
had
she
known
the
strange
circumstances
that
would
cause
her
to
alter
this
decision
she
might
have
been
startled
at
the
grim
humor
of
it
chapter
iv
the
range
robber
just
as
marian
finished
thinking
these
things
through
her
reindeer
gave
a
final
leap
which
brought
him
squarely
upon
the
crest
of
the
highest
ridge
from
this
point
so
it
seemed
to
her
she
could
view
the
whole
world
as
her
eyes
automatically
sought
the
spot
where
the
four
reindeer
had
first
appeared
a
stifled
cry
escaped
her
lips
the
valley
at
the
foot
of
that
slope
was
a
moving
sea
of
brown
and
white
the
great
herd
she
exclaimed
scarberry
s
herd
the
presence
of
this
great
herd
at
that
spot
meant
almost
certain
disaster
to
her
own
little
herd
even
if
the
herds
were
kept
seemed
extremely
pasture
would
be
ruined
and
she
had
no
other
place
to
go
if
the
herds
did
mix
it
would
take
weeks
of
patient
toil
to
separate
on
the
part
of
all
knowing
scarberry
as
she
did
she
felt
certain
that
little
of
the
work
would
be
done
by
either
his
herders
or
himself
all
up
and
down
the
coast
and
far
back
into
the
interior
scarberry
was
known
for
the
selfishness
the
brutality
and
injustice
of
his
actions
such
men
should
not
be
allowed
upon
the
alaskan
range
she
hissed
through
tightly
set
teeth
but
here
he
is
alaska
is
young
it
s
a
new
and
thrilling
little
world
all
of
itself
he
who
comes
here
must
take
his
chance
some
day
the
dishonest
men
will
be
controlled
or
driven
out
for
the
present
it
s
a
fight
and
we
must
fight
girls
though
we
are
we
fight
and
we
will
we
will
she
stamped
the
snow
savagely
bill
scarberry
shall
not
have
our
pasture
without
a
had
she
been
a
heroine
in
a
modern
novel
of
the
north
she
would
have
leaped
upon
her
put
the
spurs
to
his
side
and
gone
racing
to
the
camp
of
the
savage
bill
scarberry
then
and
there
to
tell
him
exactly
what
her
rights
were
and
to
dare
him
to
trespass
against
them
since
so
far
as
we
know
there
are
no
in
alaska
and
no
to
be
purchased
anywhere
and
since
marian
was
an
ordinary
american
girl
with
a
good
degree
of
common
sense
and
caution
and
not
a
heroine
at
all
in
the
vulgar
sense
of
the
word
she
stood
exactly
where
she
was
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
herd
through
her
field
glass
if
she
had
hoped
against
hope
that
this
was
not
scarberry
s
herd
at
all
but
some
other
herd
that
was
passing
to
winter
quarters
this
hope
was
soon
dispelled
the
four
deer
upon
the
ridge
having
strayed
some
distance
from
the
main
herd
were
now
only
a
few
hundred
yards
away
she
at
once
made
out
their
markings
two
notches
one
circular
and
one
triangular
had
been
cut
from
the
gristly
portion
of
the
right
ear
of
each
deer
this
brutal
manner
of
marking
so
common
a
few
years
earlier
had
been
kept
up
by
scarberry
who
had
as
little
thought
for
the
suffering
of
his
deer
as
he
had
for
the
rights
of
others
the
deer
owned
by
the
government
and
marian
s
own
deer
were
marked
by
aluminum
tags
attached
to
their
ears
they
re
scarberry
s
all
right
marian
concluded
it
s
his
herd
and
he
brought
them
here
if
they
had
strayed
away
by
accident
and
his
herders
had
come
after
them
they
would
be
driving
them
back
now
they
re
just
wandering
along
the
edge
of
the
herd
keeping
them
together
there
comes
one
of
them
after
the
four
strays
no
good
seeing
him
now
it
wouldn
t
accomplish
anything
and
i
might
say
too
much
i
ll
wait
and
turning
her
deer
for
a
time
she
drove
along
the
crest
of
the
ridge
i
shouldn
t
wonder
she
said
to
herself
if
he
s
already
taken
up
quarters
in
the
old
miner
s
cabin
down
there
in
the
willows
on
the
bank
of
the
little
soquina
river
yes
she
added
there
s
the
smoke
of
his
fire
to
think
she
stormed
enraged
at
the
cool
complacency
of
the
thing
to
think
that
any
man
could
be
so
mean
he
has
thousands
of
deer
and
a
broad
rich
range
he
s
afraid
the
range
may
be
scant
in
the
spring
and
his
deer
become
poor
for
the
spring
shipping
market
so
he
saves
it
by
driving
his
herd
over
here
for
a
month
or
two
that
it
may
eat
all
the
moss
we
have
and
leave
us
to
make
a
perilous
or
even
fatal
drive
to
distant
pastures
that
or
to
see
our
deer
starve
before
our
very
eyes
it
s
unfair
it
s
brutally
inhuman
and
yet
she
sighed
a
moment
later
i
suppose
the
men
up
here
are
not
all
to
blame
seems
like
there
is
something
about
the
cold
and
darkness
the
terrible
lonesomeness
of
it
all
that
makes
men
like
wolves
that
prowl
in
the
scrub
bloodthirsty
and
savage
but
that
will
do
for
sentiment
scarberry
must
not
have
his
way
he
must
not
feed
down
our
pasture
if
there
is
a
way
to
prevent
it
and
i
think
there
is
i
m
almost
sure
i
must
talk
to
patsy
about
it
it
would
mean
something
rather
hard
for
her
but
she
s
a
brave
little
soul
god
bless
her
then
she
spoke
to
her
reindeer
and
went
racing
away
down
the
slope
toward
the
camp
it
was
a
strange
looking
camp
that
awaited
marian
s
coming
two
dome
shaped
affairs
of
canvas
were
all
but
hidden
in
a
clump
of
willows
surrounded
by
deer
sleds
and
a
small
canvas
tent
for
a
strange
camp
for
alaskan
reindeer
herders
but
how
comfortable
were
those
dome
shaped
igloos
marian
had
learned
to
make
them
during
that
eventful
journey
with
the
reindeer
chukches
in
siberia
winter
skins
of
reindeer
are
cheap
very
cheap
in
alaska
being
light
portable
and
warm
marian
had
used
many
of
them
in
the
construction
of
this
winter
camp
her
heart
warmed
with
the
prospect
of
perfect
comfort
and
drawing
the
harness
from
her
reindeer
she
turned
it
loose
to
graze
then
she
parted
the
flap
to
the
igloo
which
she
and
patsy
shared
something
of
the
suppressed
excitement
which
came
to
her
from
the
discovery
of
the
rival
herd
must
still
have
shown
in
her
face
for
as
patsy
turned
from
her
work
of
preparing
a
meal
to
look
at
marian
she
noticed
the
look
on
her
face
and
exclaimed
oh
did
you
see
it
too
i
m
not
sure
that
i
know
what
you
mean
said
marian
puzzled
by
her
question
where
had
patsy
been
surely
the
herd
could
not
be
seen
from
the
camp
and
she
had
not
said
she
was
going
far
from
it
in
fact
she
had
been
left
to
watch
camp
i
ve
seen
enough
continued
marian
to
make
me
dreadfully
angry
something
s
got
to
be
done
about
it
right
away
too
as
soon
as
we
have
a
bite
to
eat
we
ll
talk
it
i
knew
you
d
feel
that
way
about
it
said
patsy
i
think
it
s
a
shame
that
they
should
hang
about
this
see
here
patsy
exclaimed
marian
seizing
her
by
the
shoulder
and
turning
her
about
what
are
are
talking
about
why
patsy
stammered
mystified
you
just
come
out
here
and
i
ll
show
dragging
her
cousin
out
of
the
igloo
and
around
the
end
of
the
willows
she
pointed
toward
a
hillcrest
there
atop
the
hill
stood
a
newly
erected
tent
and
at
that
very
moment
its
interior
was
lighted
by
a
strange
purple
light
the
purple
flame
exclaimed
marian
more
trouble
or
is
it
all
one
is
it
bill
scarberry
who
lights
that
mysterious
flame
does
he
think
that
by
doing
that
he
can
frighten
us
from
our
range
bill
scarberry
questioned
patsy
who
is
he
and
what
has
he
to
do
with
it
come
on
into
the
igloo
and
i
ll
tell
you
said
marian
shivering
as
a
gust
of
wind
swept
down
from
the
hill
as
they
turned
to
go
back
patsy
said
terogloona
came
in
a
few
minutes
ago
he
said
to
tell
you
that
another
deer
was
gone
this
time
it
is
a
spotted
that
makes
seven
that
have
disappeared
in
the
last
six
weeks
if
that
keeps
up
we
won
t
need
to
sell
our
herd
it
will
vanish
like
snow
in
the
spring
it
can
t
be
wolves
they
leave
the
bones
behind
you
can
always
tell
when
they
re
about
i
wonder
if
those
strange
people
of
the
purple
flame
are
living
off
our
deer
i
ve
a
good
mind
to
go
right
up
there
and
accuse
them
of
it
but
no
i
can
t
now
there
are
other
more
important
things
before
what
could
be
more
important
asked
patsy
in
astonishment
wait
i
ll
tell
you
said
marian
as
she
parted
the
flap
of
the
igloo
and
disappeared
within
a
half
hour
later
they
were
munching
biscuits
and
drinking
steaming
coffee
marian
had
said
not
a
single
word
about
the
problems
and
adventures
that
lay
just
before
them
patsy
asked
no
questions
she
knew
that
the
great
moment
of
confiding
came
when
they
were
snugly
tucked
in
beneath
blankets
and
deerskins
in
the
strangest
little
sleeping
room
in
all
the
world
knowing
this
she
was
content
to
wait
until
night
for
marian
to
tell
her
all
about
this
important
matter
chapter
v
planning
a
perilous
journey
the
house
in
which
the
girls
lived
was
a
cunningly
built
affair
eight
long
poles
brought
from
the
distant
river
had
been
lashed
together
at
one
end
then
they
had
all
been
raised
to
an
upright
position
and
spread
apart
like
the
pole
of
an
indian
s
tepee
canvas
was
spread
over
this
circle
of
poles
that
there
might
be
more
room
in
the
tent
curved
willow
branches
were
lashed
to
the
poles
these
held
the
canvas
away
in
a
circle
after
this
had
been
accomplished
the
whole
inside
was
lined
with
deerskins
only
an
opening
at
the
top
was
left
for
the
passing
of
smoke
from
the
yukon
stove
the
stove
stood
in
the
front
center
of
the
house
back
of
it
was
a
platform
six
by
eight
feet
this
platform
was
surrounded
on
all
four
sides
and
above
by
a
second
lining
of
deerskin
this
platform
formed
the
floor
and
the
deerskins
the
walls
of
a
little
room
within
the
skin
house
this
was
the
sleeping
room
of
marian
and
patsy
a
more
cozy
place
could
scarcely
be
imagined
even
with
the
thermometer
at
forty
below
and
the
wind
howling
about
the
igloo
this
room
was
warm
as
toast
with
the
sleeping
bag
for
a
bed
and
with
a
heavy
deerskin
rug
and
blankets
piled
upon
them
the
girls
could
sleep
in
perfect
comfort
in
this
cozy
spot
with
one
arm
thrown
loosely
about
her
cousin
s
neck
marian
lay
that
night
for
a
full
five
minutes
in
perfect
silent
repose
patsy
she
said
as
her
arm
suddenly
tightened
about
her
cousin
s
neck
in
an
affectionate
hug
would
you
be
terribly
afraid
to
stay
here
all
by
yourself
with
the
eskimos
long
patsy
faltered
i
don
t
know
exactly
perhaps
a
week
perhaps
three
in
the
arctic
one
never
knows
things
happen
there
are
blizzards
rivers
can
not
be
crossed
there
is
no
food
to
be
had
who
knows
what
may
happen
why
no
said
patsy
slowly
with
attatak
here
i
think
i
shouldn
t
i
think
said
marian
with
evident
reluctance
that
i
should
take
attatak
with
me
i
d
like
to
take
old
terogloona
he
d
be
more
help
but
at
a
time
like
this
he
can
t
leave
the
herd
he
s
absolutely
give
his
life
for
us
father
once
saved
him
from
drowning
when
a
skin
boat
was
run
down
by
a
motor
launch
an
eskimo
never
how
strangely
you
talk
said
patsy
suddenly
the
purple
flame
as
serious
an
affair
as
that
oh
no
answered
marian
that
may
become
serious
they
may
be
killing
our
deer
but
we
haven
t
caught
them
at
it
that
for
the
present
is
just
an
interesting
but
what
are
are
you
going
listen
patsy
said
marian
thoughtfully
do
you
remember
the
radio
message
we
picked
up
three
days
one
from
the
government
agent
sent
from
nome
to
fairbanks
patsy
did
remember
she
had
spent
many
interesting
hours
listening
in
on
the
compact
but
powerful
radio
set
her
father
had
presented
to
her
as
a
parting
gift
yes
she
said
i
when
did
he
say
he
was
leaving
nome
the
that
means
he
ll
be
at
the
siman
s
trading
station
on
about
the
and
siman
s
is
the
spot
on
the
trail
that
is
nearest
to
us
by
fast
driving
and
good
luck
i
can
get
there
before
but
why
should
you
persisted
patsy
then
marian
confided
to
her
cousin
the
new
trouble
they
were
facing
the
almost
certain
loss
of
their
range
with
all
the
calamities
that
would
follow
if
only
i
can
see
the
agent
before
he
passes
on
to
fairbanks
i
am
sure
he
would
deputize
someone
to
come
over
here
and
compel
scarberry
to
take
his
herd
from
our
range
if
i
can
t
do
that
then
i
don
t
see
that
we
have
a
single
chance
we
might
as
there
was
a
catch
in
her
as
well
make
scarberry
a
present
of
our
herd
and
go
on
our
way
back
to
nome
we
d
be
flat
broke
not
a
penny
in
the
world
and
would
not
have
a
single
chance
for
a
fresh
start
but
we
will
be
ruined
soon
enough
if
we
try
to
put
up
a
fight
all
by
ourselves
for
scarberry
s
too
strong
he
s
got
three
herders
to
our
one
the
agent
is
our
only
for
a
long
time
after
this
speech
all
was
silence
and
marian
was
beginning
to
think
that
patsy
had
gone
to
sleep
then
she
felt
her
soft
warm
hand
steal
into
hers
as
she
whispered
no
i
m
not
afraid
ll
stay
and
i
ll
do
all
i
can
to
keep
that
thief
and
his
deer
off
our
range
until
you
get
back
i
ll
do
it
too
see
if
i
don
t
patsy
s
southern
fighting
blood
was
up
at
such
a
time
she
felt
equal
to
anything
all
right
old
dear
only
be
marian
gave
her
a
rousing
hug
then
whispered
as
she
drew
the
deerskins
about
her
go
to
sleep
now
i
must
be
away
before
chapter
vi
a
journey
well
begun
two
hours
before
the
tardy
dawn
marian
and
attatak
were
away
with
three
tried
and
trusted
whitie
and
were
to
attempt
a
journey
of
some
hundreds
of
miles
across
trackless
wilderness
they
must
lay
their
course
by
the
stars
until
the
little
kalikumf
river
was
reached
after
this
it
was
a
straight
course
down
a
well
marked
trail
to
the
trading
station
providing
the
river
was
fully
frozen
over
this
river
was
one
of
the
many
problems
they
must
face
there
were
others
stray
dogs
might
attack
their
deer
they
might
cross
the
track
of
a
mother
wolf
and
her
hungry
pack
of
half
grown
cubs
a
blizzard
might
overtake
them
and
lacking
the
guiding
light
of
the
stars
they
might
become
lost
and
wander
aimlessly
on
the
tundra
until
cold
and
hunger
claimed
them
for
their
own
but
of
all
these
marian
thought
most
of
the
river
would
it
be
frozen
over
or
would
they
be
forced
to
turn
back
after
covering
all
those
weary
miles
and
enduring
the
hardships
attatak
she
said
to
the
native
girl
they
say
the
little
kalikumf
river
has
rapids
in
it
by
the
end
of
a
glacier
and
that
no
man
dares
shoot
those
rapids
is
that
true
yes
answered
attatak
spirit
of
water
angry
at
ice
cut
away
far
below
want
to
shoot
rapids
boats
and
man
run
beneath
that
ice
soon
smashed
boat
killed
man
that
s
it
was
quite
enough
marian
thought
but
somehow
they
must
pass
these
rapids
whether
they
were
frozen
over
or
not
ah
well
she
sighed
that
s
still
far
away
first
comes
the
fight
with
tundra
hills
and
sweeping
patting
her
reindeer
on
the
side
she
sent
him
flying
up
the
valley
while
she
raced
along
beside
him
these
reindeer
were
wonderful
steeds
no
food
need
be
carried
for
them
they
found
their
own
food
beneath
the
snow
when
day
was
done
a
hundred
miles
in
a
day
over
a
smooth
trail
was
not
too
much
for
them
soft
snow
that
was
like
granulated
not
trouble
them
they
trotted
straight
on
there
was
no
need
to
search
out
a
water
hole
that
they
might
slake
their
thirst
they
scooped
up
mouthfuls
of
snow
as
they
raced
along
wonderful
old
friends
murmured
marian
as
she
reached
out
a
hand
to
touch
her
spotted
leader
there
are
those
who
say
a
dog
team
is
better
bill
scarberry
they
say
never
drives
reindeer
always
drives
dogs
but
on
a
long
journey
a
great
marathon
race
reindeer
would
win
i
do
believe
they
would
she
was
suddenly
startled
from
her
reflections
by
the
appearance
of
a
head
not
twenty
rods
away
their
course
had
led
them
closer
to
scarberry
s
camp
than
she
thought
as
she
came
out
upon
the
ridge
she
saw
an
eskimo
scout
disappearing
into
the
willows
from
which
a
camp
smoke
was
rising
marian
was
greatly
disturbed
by
the
thought
that
scarberry
s
camp
would
soon
know
of
her
departure
she
had
hoped
that
they
might
not
learn
of
her
errand
that
they
might
not
miss
her
from
the
camp
for
patsy
s
sake
she
was
tempted
to
turn
back
but
after
a
moment
s
indecision
she
determined
to
push
forward
there
was
no
other
way
to
win
and
win
she
must
an
hour
later
she
halted
the
deer
at
a
fork
in
the
trail
directly
before
her
stood
a
bold
range
of
mountains
and
their
peaks
seemed
to
be
smoking
with
drifting
snow
blizzards
were
there
the
perpetual
blizzards
of
arctic
peaks
she
had
never
crossed
those
mountains
perhaps
no
person
ever
had
she
had
intended
skirting
them
to
the
north
this
would
require
at
least
one
added
day
of
travel
as
she
thought
of
the
perils
that
awaited
patsy
while
alone
with
the
herd
and
as
she
thought
of
the
great
necessity
of
making
every
hour
count
she
was
tempted
to
try
the
mountain
pass
here
was
a
time
for
decision
when
all
might
be
gained
by
a
bold
stroke
rising
suddenly
on
as
if
thus
to
emphasize
a
great
resolve
she
pointed
away
to
the
mountains
and
said
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
jean
d
arc
attatak
we
go
that
with
amazement
attatak
stared
at
marian
for
a
full
minute
then
with
the
cheerful
smile
of
a
born
any
member
of
her
race
always
said
that
will
be
very
good
chapter
vii
the
enchanted
mountain
since
the
time
she
had
been
able
to
remember
anything
these
mountains
of
the
far
north
standing
away
in
bleak
triangles
of
lights
and
shadows
smoking
with
the
eternally
drifting
snows
had
always
held
an
all
but
irresistible
lure
for
marian
even
as
a
child
of
six
listening
to
the
weird
of
the
eskimo
she
had
peopled
those
treeless
wind
swept
mountains
with
all
manner
of
strange
folks
now
they
were
fairies
white
and
drifting
as
the
snow
itself
now
they
were
strange
black
goblins
with
round
faces
and
red
noses
and
now
an
eskimo
people
who
lived
in
enchanted
caves
that
never
were
cold
no
matter
how
bitterly
the
wind
and
cold
assailed
the
fortresses
of
rocks
that
offered
them
protection
all
my
life
she
murmured
as
she
tightened
the
rawhide
thong
that
served
as
a
belt
to
bind
her
parka
close
about
her
waist
i
have
wanted
to
go
to
the
crest
of
that
range
and
now
i
am
to
attempt
she
shivered
a
little
at
thought
of
the
perils
that
awaited
her
many
were
the
strange
wild
tales
she
had
heard
told
round
the
glowing
stove
at
the
back
of
her
father
s
store
tales
of
privation
freezing
starvation
and
death
tales
told
by
grizzled
old
prospectors
who
had
lost
their
pals
in
a
bold
struggle
with
the
elements
she
thought
of
these
stories
and
again
she
shivered
but
she
did
not
turn
back
once
only
after
an
hour
of
travel
up
steep
ravines
and
steeper
foothills
she
paused
to
unstrap
her
field
glasses
and
look
back
over
the
way
they
had
come
then
she
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
it
was
the
wild
free
laugh
of
a
daring
soul
that
defies
failure
attatak
showed
all
her
splendid
white
teeth
in
a
grin
who
is
afraid
marian
laughed
snow
cold
cares
marian
spoke
to
her
reindeer
and
again
they
were
away
as
they
left
the
foothills
and
began
to
circle
one
of
the
lesser
slow
gradually
rising
spiral
circle
that
brought
them
higher
and
felt
the
old
charm
of
the
mountains
come
back
to
her
again
they
were
peopled
by
strange
fairies
and
goblins
so
real
was
the
illusion
that
at
times
it
seemed
to
her
that
if
worst
came
to
worst
and
they
found
themselves
lost
in
a
storm
at
the
mountain
top
they
might
call
upon
these
phantom
people
for
shelter
the
mountain
was
not
exactly
as
she
had
expected
to
find
it
she
had
supposed
that
it
was
one
vast
cone
of
gleaming
snow
in
the
main
this
was
true
yet
here
and
there
some
rocky
promontory
towering
higher
than
its
fellows
reared
itself
above
the
surface
a
pier
of
granite
standing
out
black
against
the
whiteness
about
it
mute
monument
to
all
those
daring
climbers
who
have
lost
their
lives
on
mountain
peaks
once
too
off
some
distance
to
her
right
and
farther
up
she
fancied
she
saw
the
yawning
mouth
of
a
cavern
doesn
t
seem
possible
she
told
herself
and
yet
it
did
seem
so
real
that
she
found
herself
expecting
some
strange
rip
van
people
to
come
swarming
out
of
the
cavern
she
shook
herself
as
a
rude
blast
of
wind
swept
up
from
below
all
but
freezing
her
cheek
at
a
single
wild
whirl
i
must
stop
dreaming
she
told
herself
stoutly
night
is
falling
we
are
on
the
mountain
nearing
the
crest
a
storm
is
rising
it
is
colder
here
than
in
any
place
i
have
ever
been
perhaps
we
have
been
foolhardy
but
now
we
must
go
on
even
as
she
thought
this
through
attatak
pointed
to
her
cheek
and
exclaimed
my
cheek
frozen
marian
cried
in
consternation
yes
and
we
have
an
hour
s
climb
to
reach
the
top
perhaps
more
somehow
we
must
have
shelter
attatak
can
you
build
a
snow
house
not
very
good
not
build
them
any
more
my
said
marian
slowly
as
she
rubbed
snow
on
the
white
frozen
spots
of
her
cheek
then
we
must
go
five
times
in
the
next
twenty
minutes
attatak
told
her
her
cheeks
were
frozen
twice
attatak
had
been
obliged
to
rub
the
frost
from
her
own
cheeks
each
time
the
intervals
between
freezings
were
shorter
attatak
marian
asked
can
we
make
it
i
don
t
know
the
eskimo
girl
s
face
was
very
grave
as
marian
turned
about
she
realized
that
the
storm
from
below
was
increasing
snow
stopping
nowhere
raced
past
them
to
go
smoking
out
over
the
mountain
peak
she
was
about
to
start
forward
when
again
she
caught
sight
of
a
dark
spot
on
the
mountain
side
above
it
looked
like
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
if
only
it
were
she
said
wistfully
we
would
camp
there
for
the
night
and
wait
for
the
worst
of
the
storm
to
attatak
she
said
suddenly
you
wait
here
i
am
going
to
try
to
climb
up
she
pointed
to
the
dark
spot
on
the
hillside
all
right
said
attatak
be
careful
foot
slip
start
to
slide
never
she
looked
first
up
the
hill
then
down
the
dizzy
white
slope
that
extended
for
a
half
mile
to
unknown
depths
below
as
marian
s
gaze
followed
attatak
s
she
saw
herself
gliding
down
the
slope
gaining
speed
shooting
down
faster
and
faster
to
some
awful
unknown
end
a
dash
against
a
projecting
rock
a
burial
beneath
a
hundred
feet
of
snow
little
wonder
that
her
knees
trembled
as
she
turned
to
go
yet
she
did
not
falter
with
a
cheerful
all
right
i
ll
be
careful
she
gripped
her
staff
and
began
to
climb

trouble
for
patsy
hardly
had
marian
left
camp
when
troubles
began
to
pile
up
for
patsy
dawn
had
not
yet
come
when
she
heard
a
strange
that
certainly
did
not
come
from
the
herd
collies
and
she
looked
out
and
saw
approaching
the
most
disreputable
group
of
eskimos
she
had
ever
seen
dressed
in
ragged
parkas
of
rabbit
skins
and
driving
the
gauntest
most
vicious
looking
pack
of
wolf
dogs
these
people
appeared
to
come
from
a
new
and
more
savage
world
than
hers
a
rapid
count
told
her
there
were
seven
adults
and
five
children
enough
of
them
to
eat
us
out
of
everything
even
to
skin
boots
and
rawhide
harness
she
groaned
if
they
are
determined
to
camp
here
who
s
to
prevent
them
for
a
moment
she
stood
there
staring
then
with
a
sudden
resolve
that
she
must
meet
the
situation
she
exclaimed
i
must
send
them
on
some
way
i
must
i
can
t
let
them
starve
they
must
have
food
but
they
must
be
sent
on
to
some
spot
where
they
have
relatives
who
are
able
to
feed
them
the
safety
of
the
herd
depends
upon
that
with
food
gone
we
can
not
hold
our
herders
with
no
herders
we
can
not
hold
the
deer
marian
explained
that
to
me
walking
with
all
the
dignity
her
sixteen
years
would
permit
she
approached
the
spot
where
the
strangers
had
halted
their
dogs
and
were
talking
to
old
terogloona
the
dogs
were
acting
strangely
sawing
at
the
strong
rawhide
bonds
that
held
them
to
the
sleds
they
reared
up
on
their
haunches
for
all
they
were
worth
they
smell
our
deer
patsy
said
to
herself
it
s
a
good
thing
our
herd
is
at
the
upper
end
of
the
range
she
remembered
hearing
marian
tell
how
a
whole
herd
of
five
thousand
deer
had
been
hopelessly
stampeded
by
the
lusty
of
one
wolf
dog
the
reindeer
is
their
natural
food
marian
had
explained
if
even
one
of
them
gets
loose
when
there
is
a
reindeer
about
he
will
rush
straight
at
him
and
leap
for
his
that
s
one
more
reason
why
i
must
get
these
people
to
move
on
at
once
patsy
whispered
to
herself
to
terogloona
she
said
what
do
they
want
terogloona
turned
to
them
with
a
simple
he
asked
what
do
you
want
with
many
guttural
expressions
and
much
waving
of
hands
the
leader
explained
their
wishes
he
say
smiled
terogloona
that
in
the
hills
about
here
are
many
foxes
black
fox
red
fox
white
blue
and
cross
fox
he
say
that
one
want
to
camp
here
want
to
set
traps
want
to
catch
but
what
will
they
eat
asked
patsy
terogloona
having
interpreted
the
question
smiled
again
at
their
answer
they
will
eat
foxes
he
answered
quietly
and
modestly
for
a
moment
patsy
looked
into
their
staring
hungry
questioning
eyes
they
were
lying
and
she
knew
it
but
remembering
a
bit
of
advice
of
her
father
s
never
quarrel
with
a
hungry
him
she
smiled
as
she
said
to
terogloona
you
tell
them
that
this
morning
they
shall
eat
breakfast
with
me
that
we
will
have
pancakes
and
reindeer
steak
and
tea
with
plenty
of
sugar
in
capseta
exclaimed
one
of
the
strangers
who
had
understood
the
word
sugar
and
was
passing
it
on
in
the
native
word
to
his
companions
it
was
a
busy
morning
for
patsy
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
appetites
of
these
half
starved
natives
even
terogloona
grumbled
at
the
amount
they
ate
but
patsy
silenced
him
with
the
words
first
they
must
be
fed
then
we
will
talk
to
troubles
seldom
come
singly
hardly
had
the
last
pancake
been
devoured
than
terogloona
looking
up
from
his
labors
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
a
half
mile
up
from
the
camp
the
tundra
was
brown
with
feeding
reindeer
scarberry
s
herd
he
hissed
oh
exclaimed
patsy
they
dare
to
do
that
they
dare
to
drive
their
deer
on
our
nearest
and
best
pasture
and
what
can
we
do
to
stop
them
must
marian
s
mission
be
in
vain
must
she
go
all
that
way
for
nothing
if
they
remain
the
range
will
be
stripped
long
before
she
can
return
pressing
her
hands
to
her
temples
she
sat
down
unsteadily
upon
one
of
the
sleds
of
the
strangers
she
was
struggling
in
a
wild
endeavor
to
think
of
some
way
out
then
of
a
sudden
a
wolfdog
jumped
up
at
her
very
feet
and
began
to
in
a
most
distressing
fashion
looking
up
she
saw
that
three
of
scarberry
s
deer
having
strayed
nearer
the
camp
than
the
others
had
attracted
the
dog
s
attention
like
a
flash
a
possible
solution
to
her
problem
popped
into
patsy
s
head
with
a
cry
of
delight
she
sprang
to
her
feet
the
next
instant
she
was
her
usual
calm
self
terogloona
she
said
steadily
come
into
the
tent
for
a
moment
i
have
something
i
wish
to
ask
the
task
which
marian
had
set
for
herself
the
scaling
of
the
mountain
to
the
dark
spot
in
its
side
was
no
easy
one
packed
by
the
beating
blast
of
a
thousand
gales
the
snow
was
like
white
flint
it
rang
like
steel
to
the
touch
of
her
iron
shod
staff
it
was
impossible
to
make
an
impression
in
its
surface
with
the
soft
heel
of
her
deerskin
boots
the
only
way
she
could
make
progress
was
by
the
aid
of
her
staff
one
slip
of
that
staff
one
false
step
and
she
would
go
gliding
faster
faster
ever
faster
to
a
terrible
death
far
below
yet
to
falter
now
meant
that
death
of
another
sort
waited
her
death
in
the
form
of
increasing
cold
and
gathering
storm
yet
she
made
progress
in
spite
of
the
cold
that
numbed
her
hands
and
feet
in
spite
of
her
wildly
beating
heart
regardless
of
the
terror
that
gripped
her
now
she
had
covered
half
the
distance
now
now
she
could
be
scarcely
a
hundred
yards
away
and
now
she
saw
clearly
she
had
not
been
mistaken
that
black
spot
in
the
wall
of
snow
was
a
yawning
hole
in
the
side
of
the
mountain
a
refuge
in
the
time
of
storm
could
she
but
reach
it
all
would
be
well
could
she
do
it
from
her
position
the
way
up
appeared
steeper
she
thought
of
going
back
for
the
reindeer
their
hoofs
cutting
into
the
flinty
snow
would
carry
them
safely
upward
she
now
regretted
that
she
had
not
driven
one
before
her
vain
regret
to
descend
now
was
more
perilous
than
to
go
forward
so
gripping
her
staff
firmly
pressing
her
breast
to
still
the
wild
beating
of
her
heart
and
setting
her
eyes
upon
the
goal
lest
they
stray
to
the
depths
below
she
again
began
to
climb
now
she
began
going
first
to
right
then
to
left
this
course
though
longer
was
less
steep
she
struggled
until
at
last
with
an
exultant
cry
of
joy
she
threw
herself
over
a
broad
parapet
of
snow
and
the
next
instant
found
herself
looking
down
at
a
world
which
but
the
moment
before
had
appeared
to
be
reaching
up
white
menacing
hands
at
her
then
she
turned
to
peer
into
the
dark
depths
of
the
cave
she
shivered
as
she
looked
her
old
fancies
of
fairies
and
goblins
of
strange
wild
people
inhabiting
these
mountains
came
sweeping
back
and
quite
unnerved
her
the
next
moment
she
was
herself
again
and
turning
she
called
down
to
attatak
bring
the
reindeer
up
here
is
shelter
for
the
an
inaudible
answer
came
floating
back
to
her
then
she
saw
the
reindeer
turn
about
and
begin
the
long
course
that
in
time
would
bring
them
to
the
mouth
of
the
newly
discovered
cave
and
then
marian
said
softly
to
herself
she
was
no
longer
afraid
of
the
dark
shadows
behind
her
in
the
place
of
fear
had
come
a
great
curiosity
the
same
questions
which
have
come
to
all
people
throughout
all
time
upon
discovering
a
strange
cave
in
the
mountains
had
come
to
her
am
i
she
asked
herself
the
first
person
whose
footsteps
have
echoed
in
those
mysterious
corridors
of
nature
or
have
there
been
others
if
there
have
been
others
who
were
they
what
were
they
like
what
did
they
leave
behind
that
will
tell
the
story
of
their
visit
here
marian
tried
to
shake
herself
free
from
these
questions
it
was
extremely
unlikely
that
any
one
in
all
the
hurrying
centuries
had
ever
passed
this
way
they
were
on
the
side
of
a
mountain
she
had
never
known
of
a
person
crossing
the
range
before
so
she
reasoned
but
in
the
end
found
herself
hoping
that
this
cave
might
yield
to
her
adventure
loving
soul
some
new
and
hitherto
inexperienced
thrill
in
the
meantime
she
heard
the
labored
breathing
of
the
reindeer
as
they
toiled
up
the
mountainside
they
would
soon
be
here
then
she
and
attatak
would
make
camp
and
safe
from
the
cold
and
storm
they
would
sleep
in
peace
a
great
wave
of
thankfulness
swept
over
her
and
with
the
fervent
reverence
of
a
child
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
stars
and
uttered
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
when
the
wave
of
emotion
had
passed
curiosity
again
gripped
her
she
wished
to
enter
the
cave
yet
shrank
from
it
like
a
child
afraid
of
the
dark
she
feared
to
go
forward
alone
so
drawing
her
parka
hood
close
about
her
face
to
protect
it
from
the
cold
she
waited
for
attatak
s
arrival
even
as
she
waited
there
crept
into
her
mind
a
disturbing
question
i
wonder
she
said
aloud
i
do
wonder
how
patsy
is
getting
along
with
the
herd
chapter
ix
patsy
solves
a
problem
turning
from
the
group
of
strange
natives
patsy
lead
terogloona
into
the
igloo
and
drawing
his
grandfatherly
head
down
close
to
hers
she
whispered
terogloona
are
reindeer
much
afraid
of
native
wolf
dogs
terogloona
nodded
his
head
very
very
very
much
afraid
of
them
patsy
insisted
terogloona
s
head
nodded
vigorously
then
said
patsy
with
a
twinkle
in
her
eye
if
we
let
one
wolfdog
loose
and
he
went
toward
bill
scarberry
s
herd
would
they
run
away
mebby
want
kill
reindeer
that
dog
mebby
kill
one
two
sometimes
that
way
terogloona
s
horror
of
the
thing
she
had
proposed
shone
in
his
eyes
many
years
he
had
been
a
herder
of
reindeer
many
a
dog
had
he
killed
to
save
a
reindeer
his
love
for
dogs
was
strong
his
love
for
reindeer
was
stronger
to
deliberately
turn
a
wolfdog
loose
to
prey
upon
a
herd
of
reindeer
even
an
enemy
s
herd
was
unthinkable
patsy
having
read
his
thoughts
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
we
won
t
do
that
she
said
soberly
but
terogloona
if
each
one
of
those
strange
eskimo
people
should
take
a
dog
by
his
draw
rope
and
then
they
all
should
walk
toward
that
old
cheat
s
herd
what
would
happen
a
sudden
gleam
stole
into
the
aged
herder
s
eyes
he
was
beginning
to
catch
her
meaning
the
deer
were
upon
forbidden
ground
she
was
finding
a
way
to
drive
them
back
to
the
place
where
they
belonged
they
would
go
away
very
fast
he
said
quickly
and
would
these
eskimos
do
that
would
they
do
it
for
two
sacks
of
flour
two
cans
of
two
slabs
of
bacon
and
some
sugar
asked
patsy
breathlessly
for
all
that
said
terogloona
staring
at
her
they
would
do
anything
anything
you
go
tell
them
they
shall
have
it
said
patsy
tell
them
they
must
drive
scarberry
s
herd
back
to
the
river
valley
where
they
belong
and
that
they
may
take
their
flour
sugar
and
other
things
the
eskimos
crowded
about
terogloona
listened
to
him
in
silence
until
he
had
finished
then
burst
into
a
chorus
of
ke
ke
kullemuk
which
patsy
rightfully
interpreted
as
meaning
that
they
were
ready
for
the
enterprise
and
that
terogloona
was
to
bring
on
the
reward
it
was
a
strange
line
of
march
that
formed
soon
after
seven
eskimos
each
holding
to
a
strap
at
the
other
end
of
which
a
native
dog
reared
and
ed
spread
out
in
a
broad
line
and
followed
by
a
sled
drawn
by
the
four
remaining
dogs
they
started
toward
scarberry
s
herd
as
they
came
closer
to
the
herd
the
leaders
of
the
antlered
throng
tossed
their
heads
and
whistled
as
they
came
still
closer
there
sounded
the
rattle
of
antler
upon
antler
as
the
herd
backed
in
upon
itself
the
solitary
herder
who
had
been
left
to
watch
the
herd
looked
at
the
members
of
his
own
race
and
then
shouted
at
them
angrily
the
eskimos
with
the
dogs
marched
straight
ahead
appearing
not
to
hear
the
shouts
of
the
angry
herder
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
the
herd
was
in
full
stampede
in
vain
were
the
shouts
of
scarberry
s
herders
in
vain
their
herd
dogs
sought
to
stem
the
flight
the
reindeer
had
scented
their
ancient
foe
they
had
heard
his
loud
they
were
headed
for
their
home
range
and
would
not
pause
until
they
had
reached
it
marian
s
hills
and
tundra
were
not
for
them
as
for
scarberry
s
herders
they
might
remain
where
they
were
or
follow
they
chose
to
follow
an
hour
later
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
patsy
saw
them
driving
their
sled
deer
over
the
broad
trail
of
the
herd
that
had
vanished
will
they
come
back
she
asked
terogloona
mebby
yes
mebby
no
said
terogloona
can
t
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
then
with
a
queer
look
on
his
face
he
said
one
thing
i
am
much
afraid
what
is
that
asked
patsy
mebby
not
come
said
terogloona
looking
as
if
he
was
sorry
he
had
spoken
that
was
all
he
would
say
and
patsy
felt
a
bit
uneasy
over
his
remark
nevertheless
she
could
not
help
having
a
feeling
of
pride
in
her
first
day
s
work
as
manager
of
the
herd
two
serious
problems
had
arisen
and
she
had
matched
them
against
each
other
with
the
result
that
both
had
vanished
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
the
unwelcome
visitors
and
bill
scarberry
s
great
herd
she
had
a
right
to
feel
a
bit
proud
she
marked
on
the
floor
with
a
bit
of
charcoal
we
are
minus
a
few
eatables
but
we
can
spare
them
all
right
besides
it
s
real
satisfying
to
know
that
you
ve
given
several
hungry
people
an
opportunity
to
earn
a
week
s
had
she
known
the
full
and
final
effect
of
that
week
s
provisions
she
might
have
experienced
some
moments
of
uncomfortable
thinking
lacking
that
knowledge
she
smiled
as
she
busied
herself
with
preparing
a
belated
breakfast
for
terogloona
and
herself
chapter
x
a
startling
discovery
to
attatak
whose
mind
was
filled
with
the
weird
tales
of
the
spirit
world
to
enter
a
cave
away
on
this
unknown
mountain
side
was
a
far
greater
trial
than
it
was
to
marian
cold
blizzards
the
wild
beasts
of
she
could
face
but
the
possible
dwelling
place
of
the
spirits
of
dead
polar
bears
and
walruses
to
say
nothing
of
old
women
who
had
died
because
they
had
disregarded
the
incantations
of
witch
doctors
ugh
was
very
bad
indeed
marian
felt
the
native
girl
tremble
as
she
took
her
arm
and
led
her
gently
forward
into
the
dark
depths
of
the
cave
the
entrance
was
not
wide
perhaps
twelve
feet
across
but
it
was
fully
as
high
as
it
was
broad
our
deer
can
come
in
too
whispered
marian
if
it
goes
back
far
if
there
are
no
wolves
said
attatak
with
a
shudder
wolves
marian
had
not
thought
of
that
you
wait
here
she
whispered
i
ll
go
for
the
no
no
attatak
gripped
her
arm
until
it
hurt
i
will
go
so
back
out
of
the
cave
they
felt
their
way
now
tripping
over
rocks
that
rolled
away
with
a
hollow
sound
like
distant
thunder
now
brushing
the
wall
till
they
came
at
last
to
the
open
air
marian
hated
all
this
delay
famished
with
hunger
chilled
to
the
very
marrow
and
weary
enough
to
drop
she
longed
for
the
warmth
of
the
fire
she
hoped
they
might
light
for
the
food
they
would
warm
over
it
and
the
comforting
rest
that
would
follow
yet
she
realized
that
the
utmost
caution
must
be
taken
wolves
once
driven
from
a
cave
might
stampede
their
reindeer
and
lose
them
forever
in
the
mountains
without
reindeer
they
should
have
great
trouble
in
getting
back
to
camp
the
agent
would
go
on
his
way
ignorant
of
their
dilemma
their
pasture
land
would
be
lost
and
perhaps
their
herd
with
it
the
rifle
securely
gripped
in
the
hands
of
attatak
who
was
the
surer
shot
of
the
two
they
again
started
into
the
cave
strange
to
say
once
the
rifle
was
in
her
grasp
attatak
became
the
bravest
of
the
brave
marian
carried
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
block
of
safety
matches
the
candle
was
not
lighted
so
drafty
was
the
entrance
that
no
candle
would
stay
lighted
each
step
she
hoped
would
bring
them
to
a
place
where
the
draft
would
not
extinguish
her
candle
but
in
this
she
was
disappointed
it
s
a
windy
cavern
she
said
must
be
an
entrance
at
each
calling
on
attatak
to
pause
marian
struck
a
match
it
flared
up
then
went
out
a
second
one
did
the
same
the
third
lighted
the
candle
there
was
just
time
for
a
hasty
glance
about
gloomy
brown
walls
lay
to
right
and
left
of
them
and
the
awful
gloom
of
the
cave
was
most
alarming
glancing
down
at
her
feet
marian
uttered
a
low
exclamation
of
surprise
then
with
such
a
definite
and
direct
puff
of
wind
as
might
come
from
human
lips
the
candle
was
snuffed
out
was
it
attatak
whispered
she
was
shaking
so
that
marian
feared
she
would
let
the
rifle
go
clattering
to
the
rocky
floor
nothing
marian
answered
really
nothing
at
all
the
ashes
of
a
and
i
she
gulped
thought
i
saw
bones
in
the
ashes
bones
this
time
the
rifle
did
clatter
to
the
floor
attatak
marian
scolded
attatak
this
is
absurd
groping
in
the
dark
for
the
rifle
she
grasped
a
handful
of
ashes
then
something
hard
and
cold
that
was
not
the
rifle
ugh
she
groaned
struggling
with
all
her
might
to
keep
from
running
away
again
she
tried
for
the
rifle
this
time
successfully
she
gave
it
to
attatak
with
the
admonition
do
take
care
attatak
whispered
stepping
gingerly
out
of
the
ashes
of
the
mysterious
they
again
started
forward
the
current
of
air
now
became
less
and
less
strong
and
finally
when
marian
again
tried
the
candle
it
burned
with
a
flickering
blaze
a
glance
about
told
them
they
were
now
between
narrow
dark
walls
that
the
ceiling
was
very
high
and
there
was
nothing
beneath
their
feet
but
rock
the
yellow
glow
of
light
cheered
them
if
there
were
wolves
they
had
made
no
sound
the
gleam
of
their
eyes
had
not
been
seen
if
the
spirits
of
the
men
who
had
built
that
long
extinguished
fire
still
haunted
the
place
the
light
would
drive
them
away
attatak
assured
marian
of
that
with
one
candle
securely
set
in
a
rocky
recess
and
with
another
close
at
hand
attatak
was
even
willing
to
remain
in
the
cave
while
marian
brought
the
reindeer
in
a
little
way
and
carried
the
articles
necessary
for
a
meal
to
the
back
of
the
cave
there
is
no
moss
on
this
barren
mountain
marian
sighed
our
reindeer
must
go
hungry
but
once
we
are
off
the
mountain
they
shall
have
a
grand
by
the
time
they
had
made
a
small
fire
on
the
floor
of
the
cave
and
had
finished
their
supper
night
had
closed
in
upon
their
mountain
world
darkness
came
quickly
deepened
tenfold
by
the
wild
storm
that
appeared
to
redouble
its
fury
at
every
fresh
blast
the
darkness
without
vied
with
the
bleakness
of
the
cave
until
both
were
one
such
a
storm
as
it
was
born
and
reared
on
the
coast
of
alaska
marian
had
never
before
experienced
anything
that
approached
it
in
its
shrieking
violence
she
did
not
wonder
now
that
the
mountains
appeared
to
smoke
with
sweeping
snow
she
shivered
as
she
thought
what
it
would
have
meant
had
they
not
found
the
cave
why
she
said
to
attatak
we
should
have
been
caught
up
by
the
wind
like
two
bits
of
snow
and
hurled
over
the
mountain
the
two
girls
walked
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
for
a
moment
stood
peering
into
the
night
the
whistle
and
howl
of
the
wind
was
deafening
how
it
did
howl
the
very
rock
ribbed
mountain
seemed
to
shake
from
the
violence
of
it
too
bad
said
attatak
as
she
turned
her
back
to
the
storm
for
marian
however
the
spectacle
held
a
strange
fascination
had
the
thing
been
possible
she
should
have
liked
nothing
better
than
leaping
out
into
it
to
battle
with
it
to
answer
its
roar
with
a
wild
scream
of
her
own
to
whirl
away
with
it
to
become
a
part
of
it
to
revel
in
its
it
seemed
to
her
would
be
the
height
of
ecstatic
joy
such
was
the
call
of
unbridled
nature
to
her
joyous
triumphant
youth
it
was
with
reluctance
that
she
at
last
turned
back
into
the
depths
of
the
cave
and
helped
attatak
unroll
the
bedding
roll
and
prepare
for
the
night
she
whispered
to
attatak
before
she
closed
her
eyes
in
sleep
if
the
storm
has
not
passed
and
we
dare
not
venture
out
we
will
explore
the
attatak
answered
drowsily
the
next
moment
the
roaring
storm
had
no
auditors
the
girls
were
fast
asleep
chapter
xi
the
girl
of
the
purple
flame
there
is
something
in
the
sharp
tang
of
the
arctic
air
in
the
honest
weariness
of
a
long
day
of
tramping
in
the
invigorating
freshness
of
everything
about
one
that
makes
for
perfect
repose
in
spite
of
the
problems
that
faced
them
regardless
of
the
mystery
that
haunted
this
chamber
of
nature
hour
after
hour
to
the
very
tune
of
the
whirling
storm
the
girls
slept
the
calm
and
peaceful
sleep
of
those
who
bear
ill
will
toward
no
one
when
at
last
marian
pried
her
eyes
open
to
look
at
her
watch
she
was
surprised
to
learn
that
eight
hours
had
passed
she
did
not
look
to
see
the
gleam
of
dawn
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
dawn
in
this
strange
arctic
land
was
still
four
hours
away
she
knew
that
the
storm
was
still
raging
there
came
the
roar
and
boom
of
the
wind
now
and
again
as
if
the
demons
of
storm
were
determined
upon
pulling
them
from
their
retreat
a
steady
sucking
breath
of
it
came
sweeping
down
through
the
cave
marian
listened
and
then
she
quoted
blow
high
blow
low
not
all
your
snow
can
quench
our
s
ruddy
she
smiled
to
herself
their
tiny
fire
had
gone
out
long
ago
but
another
might
easily
be
kindled
she
was
about
to
turn
over
in
her
bed
for
another
ten
winks
when
she
suddenly
remembered
the
mysterious
discovery
of
the
night
ashes
and
the
bones
and
at
once
she
found
herself
eager
for
an
exploration
of
the
place
to
discover
if
possible
what
sort
of
people
had
been
here
before
her
to
guess
how
long
ago
that
had
been
to
search
for
any
relics
they
may
have
left
these
exerted
upon
her
mind
an
irresistible
appeal
she
had
risen
and
was
drawing
on
her
knickers
when
attatak
awakened
come
on
marian
cried
it
is
morning
the
storm
is
still
tearing
away
at
the
mountain
side
we
can
t
go
on
our
way
too
bad
broke
in
attatak
now
bill
scarberry
will
get
our
pasture
the
agent
will
pass
before
we
arrive
we
shall
have
no
one
to
defend
our
at
this
marian
plumped
down
upon
her
sleeping
bag
what
attatak
said
was
true
should
they
be
unable
to
leave
the
cave
this
day
the
gain
they
had
hoped
to
make
was
lost
well
she
laughed
bravely
we
have
reindeer
and
they
are
swift
we
will
win
anyway
she
said
springing
to
her
feet
no
use
crying
over
spilled
milk
until
we
can
leave
the
cave
our
time
s
our
own
come
on
get
dressed
we
ll
see
what
wealth
lies
hidden
in
this
old
home
in
the
mountain
in
the
meantime
patsy
was
having
a
full
share
of
strange
adventure
late
in
the
afternoon
feeling
herself
quite
free
from
the
annoying
presence
of
the
visiting
band
of
eskimos
and
of
scarberry
s
herd
she
harnessed
her
favorite
spotted
reindeer
and
went
for
a
drive
up
the
valley
the
two
young
eskimos
who
worked
under
terogloona
had
been
sent
into
the
hills
to
round
up
their
herd
and
bring
them
into
camp
this
was
one
of
the
daily
tasks
of
the
herders
if
this
was
done
every
day
the
herd
would
never
stray
too
far
patsy
liked
to
mount
a
hill
with
her
sled
deer
and
then
like
a
general
reviewing
his
troops
watch
the
broad
procession
of
brown
and
white
deer
as
they
marched
down
the
valley
this
day
she
was
a
little
late
the
herd
began
passing
before
she
had
climbed
half
way
up
the
ridge
she
paused
to
watch
them
pass
then
undecided
whether
to
climb
on
up
the
slope
or
turn
back
to
camp
she
stood
there
until
the
uncertain
light
of
the
low
arctic
sun
had
faded
and
night
had
come
just
as
she
had
decided
to
turn
her
deer
toward
home
she
caught
a
purple
gleam
on
the
hill
directly
above
her
the
purple
flame
she
exclaimed
and
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
above
me
i
could
climb
up
there
in
fifteen
for
a
moment
she
stood
undecided
then
seized
by
a
sudden
touch
of
daring
she
whirled
her
deer
about
tethered
him
to
his
sled
and
went
scouting
up
a
gully
toward
the
spot
where
the
mysterious
flame
had
flashed
for
a
moment
then
had
gone
out
i
ll
see
something
anyway
she
told
herself
as
she
strove
in
vain
to
still
the
painful
fluttering
of
her
heart
she
had
worked
her
way
to
a
position
on
the
side
of
the
hill
where
the
outlines
of
a
tent
with
its
extension
of
stovepipe
standing
out
black
above
it
was
outlined
against
the
sky
then
to
her
consternation
she
saw
the
flaps
of
the
tent
move
someone
is
coming
out
she
whispered
to
herself
perhaps
they
have
been
watching
me
through
a
hole
in
the
tent
her
heart
stopped
beating
at
thought
of
the
dangers
that
might
be
threatening
should
she
turn
and
flee
or
should
she
flatten
herself
against
the
snow
and
hope
that
she
might
not
be
seen
suddenly
remembering
that
her
parka
made
of
white
fawnskin
would
blend
perfectly
with
the
snow
she
decided
on
the
latter
course
there
was
not
a
second
to
lose
hardly
had
she
melted
into
the
background
of
snow
when
a
person
appeared
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
then
it
was
that
patsy
received
a
thrilling
shock
she
had
been
prepared
to
see
a
bearded
miner
an
eskimo
most
any
type
of
man
but
the
person
she
saw
was
not
a
man
but
scarcely
more
than
a
girl
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
patsy
suppressed
an
audible
exclamation
closing
her
lips
tight
she
took
one
startled
look
at
the
strange
girl
carefully
dressed
in
short
plaid
skirt
bright
checkered
mackinaw
and
a
blue
knit
hood
the
girl
stood
perfectly
silhouetted
against
the
sky
her
eyes
and
hair
were
brown
patsy
was
sure
of
that
her
features
were
fine
there
was
a
deep
shade
of
healthy
pink
in
her
cheeks
she
s
not
a
native
alaskan
patsy
told
herself
like
me
she
has
not
been
long
in
how
she
knew
this
she
could
not
exactly
tell
but
she
was
as
sure
of
it
as
she
was
of
anything
in
life
suddenly
she
was
puzzled
by
a
question
what
had
brought
the
girl
from
the
warmth
of
the
tent
into
the
cold
patsy
saw
her
glance
up
toward
the
sky
there
was
a
rapt
look
on
her
face
as
she
gazed
fixedly
at
the
first
evening
stars
it
s
as
if
she
were
saying
a
prayer
or
a
psalm
patsy
murmured
the
heavens
declare
the
glory
of
god
and
the
firmament
his
for
a
full
moment
the
strange
girl
stood
thus
then
turning
slowly
she
stepped
back
into
the
tent
that
the
tent
had
at
least
one
other
occupant
patsy
knew
at
once
by
a
shadow
that
flitted
across
the
wall
as
the
girl
entered
well
mused
patsy
well
now
i
wonder
she
was
more
puzzled
than
ever
but
suddenly
remembering
that
she
had
barely
escaped
being
caught
spying
on
these
strangers
she
rose
and
went
gliding
down
the
hill
when
she
reached
her
reindeer
she
loosed
him
and
turned
him
toward
home
nor
did
she
allow
him
to
pause
until
he
stood
beside
her
igloo
once
inside
her
lodge
with
the
candle
gleaming
brightly
and
a
fire
of
dry
willows
snapping
in
the
stove
patsy
took
a
good
long
time
for
thinking
things
through
somewhat
to
her
surprise
she
found
herself
experiencing
a
new
feeling
of
safety
it
was
true
she
had
not
been
much
afraid
since
marian
had
left
her
alone
with
the
herders
for
it
was
but
a
step
from
her
igloo
to
terogloona
s
tent
this
old
herder
who
treated
her
as
if
she
were
his
grandchild
would
gladly
give
his
life
in
defending
her
from
danger
nevertheless
a
little
feeling
of
fear
lingered
in
her
mind
whenever
she
thought
of
the
tent
of
the
purple
flame
as
she
thought
of
it
now
she
realized
that
she
had
lost
that
fear
when
she
had
discovered
that
there
was
a
girl
living
in
that
tent
and
yet
she
told
herself
there
are
bad
women
in
alaska
just
as
there
are
everywhere
she
might
be
bad
but
somehow
she
didn
t
look
bad
she
looked
educated
and
sort
of
refined
looked
a
bit
lonely
as
she
stood
there
gazing
at
the
stars
i
wanted
to
walk
right
up
to
her
and
say
hello
just
like
that
nice
and
chummy
perhaps
i
will
too
some
day
and
perhaps
i
won
t
she
thoughtfully
added
a
moment
later
something
of
the
old
dread
of
the
purple
flame
still
haunted
her
mind
then
too
there
were
two
puzzling
questions
why
were
these
people
here
at
all
and
how
did
they
live
if
not
off
marian
s
deer
not
many
days
later
patsy
was
to
make
a
startling
discovery
that
to
all
appearances
was
an
answer
to
this
last
question
chapter
xii
ancient
treasure
with
a
hand
that
trembled
slightly
marian
held
the
candle
that
was
to
light
their
way
in
the
exploration
of
the
mysterious
mountain
cavern
as
if
drawn
by
a
magnet
she
led
the
way
straight
to
the
spot
where
but
a
few
hours
before
she
had
been
so
frightened
by
finding
herself
standing
in
the
burned
out
ashes
and
bones
of
an
old
she
laughed
now
as
she
bent
over
to
examine
the
spot
there
could
be
no
question
that
there
had
once
been
a
here
there
were
a
number
of
bones
strewn
about
too
that
fire
she
said
slowly
must
have
burned
itself
out
years
ago
perhaps
fifty
years
those
bones
are
from
the
legs
of
a
reindeer
or
caribou
they
re
old
too
how
gray
and
dry
they
are
they
are
about
to
fall
into
she
studied
the
spot
for
some
time
at
last
she
straightened
up
not
much
to
it
after
all
she
sighed
it
s
interesting
enough
to
know
that
some
storm
blown
traveler
who
attempted
the
pass
as
we
did
once
spent
the
night
here
but
he
left
no
relic
of
interest
behind
have
you
there
she
turned
suddenly
to
her
companion
attatak
was
holding
a
slim
dull
brown
object
in
her
hand
only
the
broken
handle
of
an
old
she
said
slowly
still
studying
the
thing
by
the
candle
light
it
s
and
quite
old
mebby
twenty
mebby
fifty
years
who
knows
why
are
you
looking
at
it
so
sharply
trying
to
read
what
well
smiled
attatak
as
she
placed
the
bit
of
ivory
in
marian
s
hand
long
ago
before
the
white
man
came
my
people
told
stories
by
drawing
little
pictures
on
ivory
they
scratched
the
pictures
on
the
ivory
then
rubbed
smoke
black
in
them
so
they
would
see
them
well
this
handle
is
square
it
has
four
sides
each
side
tells
a
story
three
are
of
polar
bear
and
caribou
but
the
other
side
is
something
else
i
can
t
quite
tell
what
it
marian
studied
it
for
a
time
in
silence
mr
cole
would
love
that
she
said
at
last
and
her
thoughts
were
far
away
for
the
moment
her
mind
had
carried
her
back
to
those
thrilling
days
aboard
the
pleasure
yacht
o
since
you
have
doubtless
read
our
other
book
the
cruise
of
o
i
need
scarcely
remind
you
that
cole
was
the
curator
of
a
great
museum
and
knew
all
about
strange
and
ancient
things
he
had
done
much
to
aid
marian
and
her
friends
in
unravelling
the
mystery
of
the
strange
blue
face
bring
it
along
marian
said
handing
the
piece
back
to
attatak
it
tells
us
one
the
man
who
built
that
fire
was
an
eskimo
it
is
worth
keeping
i
should
like
to
take
it
with
me
to
the
museum
when
i
go
back
now
she
said
briskly
let
s
go
all
over
the
cave
there
may
be
things
that
we
have
not
yet
and
indeed
there
were
it
was
with
the
delicious
sensation
of
research
and
adventure
that
the
girls
wandered
back
and
forth
from
wall
to
wall
of
the
gloomy
cavern
not
until
they
had
passed
the
spot
where
they
had
spent
the
night
and
were
far
back
in
the
cave
did
they
make
a
discovery
of
any
importance
then
it
was
that
marian
with
a
little
cry
of
joy
put
out
her
hand
and
took
from
a
ledge
of
rock
a
strange
looking
little
dish
no
larger
than
a
finger
bowl
it
was
so
incrusted
with
dirt
and
dust
that
she
could
not
tell
whether
it
was
really
a
rare
find
of
some
ancient
pottery
or
an
ordinary
china
dish
left
here
by
some
white
adventurer
however
something
within
her
seemed
to
whisper
here
is
wealth
untold
here
is
a
prize
that
will
cause
your
friend
the
museum
curator
to
turn
green
with
another
said
attatak
as
she
took
down
a
larger
object
of
the
same
general
shape
a
few
feet
farther
on
was
a
ledge
fairly
covered
with
curious
objects
strange
shaped
dishes
bits
of
ivory
black
as
coal
pieces
of
copper
dulled
with
age
such
were
the
treasures
of
the
past
that
lay
before
them
someone
s
pantry
of
long
ago
mused
marian
very
very
old
said
attatak
holding
up
a
bit
of
black
ivory
mebby
two
hundred
mebby
five
hundred
years
ivory
turn
black
slow
very
very
slow
by
and
by
after
long
long
time
look
like
as
attatak
uttered
these
words
marian
could
have
hugged
her
for
sheer
joy
she
knew
now
that
they
had
made
a
very
rare
find
the
objects
had
not
been
left
there
by
a
white
man
but
by
some
native
broken
bits
of
ancient
eskimo
pottery
had
been
found
in
mounds
on
the
arctic
coast
those
had
been
treasured
but
here
were
perfect
specimens
such
as
any
museum
in
the
world
would
covet
and
yet
had
she
but
known
it
the
rareness
and
value
of
some
of
these
were
to
exceed
her
fondest
dreams
but
this
discovery
was
to
come
later
drawing
off
her
calico
parka
marian
tied
it
at
the
top
and
using
it
as
a
sack
carefully
packed
all
the
articles
let
s
go
back
she
said
in
an
awed
whisper
attatak
answered
there
was
a
strange
spookiness
about
the
place
that
made
them
half
afraid
to
remain
any
longer
they
had
turned
to
go
when
marian
chancing
to
glance
down
saw
the
bit
of
ivory
they
had
found
by
the
outer
at
first
she
was
tempted
to
let
it
remain
where
it
lay
it
seemed
an
insignificant
thing
after
the
discovery
of
these
rarer
treasures
but
finally
she
picked
it
up
and
thrust
it
into
her
bag
well
for
her
that
she
did
later
it
was
to
prove
the
key
to
a
mystery
an
entirely
new
mystery
which
had
as
yet
not
appeared
above
their
horizon
but
was
in
a
way
associated
with
the
mystery
of
the
purple
flame
listen
said
marian
as
they
came
nearer
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
i
do
believe
the
storm
is
passing
perhaps
we
can
get
off
the
mountain
oh
attatak
we
ll
win
yet
won
t
that
be
glorious
it
was
true
the
storm
was
passing
attatak
was
dispatched
to
investigate
and
soon
came
hurrying
back
with
the
report
that
they
could
be
on
their
way
as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
breakfast
and
packed
marian
was
possessed
with
a
wild
desire
to
inspect
her
newly
discovered
wash
scrub
and
scrape
it
and
try
to
discover
how
it
was
made
and
what
it
was
made
of
yet
she
realized
that
any
delay
for
such
a
cause
would
be
all
but
criminal
folly
so
after
a
hasty
breakfast
she
rubbed
as
much
dust
as
she
could
from
the
strange
treasures
and
packed
them
carefully
in
the
folds
of
the
sleeping
bags
soon
the
girls
found
themselves
beside
their
deer
picking
their
way
cautiously
forward
over
the
remaining
distance
to
the
divide
then
quite
as
cautiously
they
started
down
the
other
side
during
the
day
they
halted
for
a
cold
lunch
while
their
reindeer
fed
on
a
broad
plateau
a
protected
place
where
they
were
safe
from
the
wild
blizzards
of
the
peaks
that
loomed
far
above
them
from
now
on
said
marian
there
will
be
little
rest
for
us
our
bold
stroke
has
saved
us
nothing
it
is
now
a
question
of
whether
reindeer
are
trustworthy
steeds
in
the
arctic
also
whether
girls
are
capable
of
solving
problems
and
of
enduring
many
hardships
as
for
me
she
shook
her
fist
in
the
general
direction
of
scarberry
s
herd
i
ll
say
they
are
we
ll
win
see
if
we
don
t
to
this
declaration
attatak
uttered
an
which
to
marian
sounded
like
a
fervent
amen
chapter
xiii
the
long
trail
at
nightfall
of
the
following
day
worn
from
the
constant
travel
and
walking
as
if
in
their
sleep
the
two
girls
came
to
the
junction
of
the
two
forks
of
a
modest
sized
river
the
frozen
stream
coated
as
it
was
by
a
hard
crust
of
snow
had
given
them
a
perfect
trail
over
the
last
ten
miles
of
travel
before
that
they
had
crossed
endless
tiers
of
hills
whose
hard
packed
and
treacherously
slippery
sides
had
brought
grief
to
them
and
to
their
reindeer
twice
an
overturned
sled
had
dragged
a
reindeer
off
his
feet
and
reindeer
sled
and
driver
had
gone
rolling
and
tumbling
down
the
hill
to
be
piled
in
a
heap
in
the
gully
below
those
had
been
trying
hours
but
now
they
were
looking
forward
to
many
miles
of
smooth
going
between
the
banks
of
this
river
first
however
there
must
be
rest
and
food
for
them
and
for
their
deer
they
were
watching
the
shelving
bank
for
some
likely
place
to
camp
where
there
was
shelter
from
the
biting
wind
and
driftwood
lodged
along
the
bank
for
a
fire
then
with
a
little
cry
of
surprise
marian
pointed
at
a
bend
in
the
river
at
this
point
she
said
the
river
runs
attatak
looked
straight
down
the
river
and
at
the
low
sweeping
banks
beyond
then
uttered
a
low
in
agreement
that
means
that
we
can
not
follow
the
river
said
marian
our
course
runs
northwest
every
mile
travelled
on
the
river
takes
us
off
our
course
and
lessens
our
chance
of
reaching
our
goal
in
what
shall
we
do
asked
attatak
in
perplexity
let
me
think
said
marian
there
is
time
enough
to
decide
we
must
camp
here
the
deer
must
have
food
and
rest
so
must
we
there
is
not
much
danger
of
wolves
if
any
come
prowling
around
the
deer
will
let
us
know
soon
enough
we
will
sleep
on
our
sleds
and
if
anything
goes
wrong
the
deer
tethered
to
the
sleds
will
tumble
us
out
of
our
beds
anyway
they
will
waken
soon
supper
was
over
the
deer
having
had
their
fill
of
moss
dug
from
beneath
the
snow
had
lain
down
to
rest
the
girls
spread
their
sleeping
bags
out
upon
the
sleds
and
prepared
for
a
few
hours
of
much
needed
rest
attatak
with
the
carefree
unconcern
that
is
characteristic
of
her
race
had
scarcely
buried
her
face
in
an
improvised
pillow
when
she
was
fast
asleep
sleep
did
not
come
so
quickly
to
marian
many
matters
of
interest
lingered
in
her
mind
it
was
as
if
her
mind
were
a
room
all
littered
up
with
the
odds
and
ends
of
a
day
s
work
she
must
put
it
to
rights
before
she
could
sleep
she
thought
once
more
of
the
strange
treasures
they
had
brought
from
the
cave
tired
as
she
was
she
was
tempted
to
get
out
those
articles
and
look
at
them
and
to
brush
them
up
a
bit
and
see
what
they
were
like
i
know
it
s
foolish
she
told
herself
but
it
s
exactly
as
if
i
had
hung
up
my
stocking
on
christmas
eve
and
then
when
christmas
morning
came
had
been
obliged
to
seize
my
stocking
without
so
much
as
a
glance
inside
and
forced
to
start
at
once
on
a
long
journey
which
would
offer
me
no
opportunity
to
examine
my
stocking
until
the
journey
was
at
an
end
but
i
won
t
look
not
now
it
s
too
cold
she
shivered
as
she
drew
herself
farther
down
into
the
furry
depths
of
her
sleeping
bag
she
was
reminded
of
the
time
she
and
patsy
had
slept
together
beneath
the
stars
she
could
not
help
wishing
that
patsy
was
with
her
now
sharing
her
sleeping
bag
and
looking
up
at
the
gleaming
milky
way
she
wondered
vaguely
how
patsy
was
getting
on
with
the
herd
but
the
thought
did
not
greatly
disturb
her
she
was
about
to
drift
off
to
the
land
of
dreams
when
a
thought
popped
into
her
mind
that
brought
her
up
wide
awake
again
their
morning
s
course
was
not
yet
laid
what
should
it
be
she
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
think
then
like
a
flash
it
came
to
her
it
s
the
hard
way
she
whispered
to
herself
seems
as
if
it
were
always
the
hard
way
that
is
safe
and
the
thought
that
had
come
to
her
was
this
in
order
to
reach
their
destination
they
must
still
travel
several
miles
north
the
river
they
were
following
flowed
southwest
to
go
south
was
to
go
out
of
their
way
were
they
to
strike
due
north
across
country
they
might
in
the
course
of
a
day
s
travel
come
to
another
stream
which
did
not
angle
toward
the
south
that
would
mean
infinitely
hard
travel
over
snow
that
was
soft
and
yielding
and
across
tundra
whose
frozen
caribou
bogs
were
as
rough
as
a
cordwood
road
it
s
the
long
hard
way
she
sighed
but
we
may
win
if
we
follow
this
river
we
never
then
with
all
her
problems
put
in
order
she
fell
asleep
chapter
xiv
mysterious
music
two
days
later
marian
and
attatak
found
themselves
tramping
slowly
along
behind
their
tired
deer
it
was
night
now
and
again
the
moon
shot
a
golden
beam
of
light
across
their
trail
for
the
most
part
that
trail
was
dark
overshadowed
by
great
spruce
and
fir
trees
that
stood
out
black
against
the
whiteness
of
the
snow
each
tree
seeming
a
gown
clad
witnesses
of
their
passing
there
was
now
a
definitely
marked
trail
an
ax
cut
here
and
there
on
a
tree
told
them
this
trail
had
been
made
by
men
and
not
by
moose
and
caribou
they
had
seen
no
traces
of
man
no
human
habitation
had
sent
its
gleam
of
light
across
their
trail
to
bid
them
welcome
scarcely
knowing
whether
she
wished
to
see
the
light
of
a
cabin
marian
tramped
doggedly
on
it
was
long
past
camping
time
yet
she
feared
to
make
camp
several
times
she
had
caught
the
long
drawn
howl
of
a
wolf
faint
and
indistinct
in
the
distance
with
a
burst
of
joy
and
hope
she
thought
of
the
progress
they
had
made
the
tramp
across
open
tundra
had
been
fearfully
hard
they
had
however
reaped
from
it
a
rich
reward
the
river
they
had
found
was
larger
than
the
other
and
its
surface
had
offered
an
almost
perfect
trail
it
flowed
north
by
west
instead
of
southwest
it
took
them
directly
on
their
way
even
now
marian
was
wondering
if
this
were
not
the
very
river
at
whose
junction
with
the
great
yukon
was
located
the
station
they
sought
to
reach
before
the
government
agent
had
passed
if
it
is
she
murmured
what
can
hinder
us
from
making
the
station
in
time
it
seemed
that
there
could
be
but
one
answer
to
this
yet
in
the
arctic
there
is
no
expression
that
is
so
invariably
true
as
this
one
you
never
can
then
suddenly
marian
s
thoughts
were
drawn
to
another
subject
a
peculiar
gleam
of
moonlight
among
the
trees
reminded
her
of
the
purple
flame
at
once
she
began
wondering
what
could
be
the
source
of
that
peculiar
and
powerful
light
who
possessed
it
and
what
their
purpose
was
in
living
on
the
tundra
and
patsy
she
questioned
herself
i
wonder
if
they
are
troubling
her
wonder
if
they
are
really
living
off
our
deer
i
wish
i
had
not
been
obliged
to
leave
our
camp
seems
that
there
were
problems
enough
without
this
i
suddenly
she
put
out
one
hand
and
stopped
her
deer
while
with
the
other
she
gave
attatak
a
mute
signal
for
silence
breaking
gently
through
the
hushed
stillness
of
the
forest
like
a
spring
zephyr
over
a
meadow
there
came
to
her
ears
a
sound
of
wonderful
sweetness
music
she
breathed
and
such
music
the
very
music
of
heaven
moments
passed
and
still
with
slightly
bowed
heads
as
if
listening
to
the
angelus
they
stood
there
still
as
statues
listening
to
the
strange
music
the
woods
were
god
s
first
temples
marian
whispered
for
the
moment
she
lived
as
in
a
trance
a
great
lover
of
music
she
felt
the
thrill
of
perfect
melody
breaking
over
her
soul
like
bright
waves
upon
golden
sand
she
fancied
that
this
melody
had
no
human
origin
that
it
was
a
spontaneous
outburst
from
the
very
heart
of
the
forest
god
himself
speaking
through
the
mute
life
of
earth
when
this
illusion
had
passed
she
still
stood
there
wondering
attatak
what
day
of
the
week
is
this
for
a
moment
attatak
did
not
answer
she
was
counting
on
her
fingers
sunday
she
said
at
last
sunday
marian
repeated
and
that
is
a
pipe
organ
how
wonderful
how
perfectly
beautiful
a
pipe
organ
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
and
yet
she
hesitated
scarcely
daring
to
believe
her
senses
how
could
a
pipe
organ
be
brought
way
up
here
but
it
is
she
affirmed
a
few
seconds
later
attatak
you
watch
the
deer
while
i
go
ahead
and
find
out
what
sort
of
place
it
is
and
whether
there
are
dangerous
dogs
her
wonder
grew
with
every
step
that
she
took
in
the
direction
of
the
mysterious
musician
as
she
came
closer
and
the
tones
became
more
distinct
she
knew
that
she
could
not
be
mistaken
it
s
a
pipe
organ
she
told
herself
with
conviction
and
a
splendid
one
at
that
who
in
all
the
world
would
bring
such
a
wonderful
instrument
away
up
here
strange
i
have
never
heard
of
this
settlement
it
must
be
a
rather
large
village
or
they
could
not
afford
such
an
organ
for
their
as
she
thought
of
these
things
and
as
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
music
still
came
sweeping
through
the
trees
a
strange
spell
fell
upon
her
it
was
as
if
she
were
resting
upon
the
soft
cushioned
seat
of
some
splendid
church
with
the
service
appealing
to
her
sense
of
the
artistic
and
the
beautiful
and
to
her
instinct
of
reverence
with
the
soft
lights
pervading
all
she
was
again
in
the
chapel
of
her
own
university
oh
she
cried
i
do
hope
it
s
a
real
church
and
that
we
re
not
too
late
for
the
one
thought
troubled
her
as
she
hurried
forward
if
this
was
a
large
village
where
were
the
tracks
of
dog
teams
that
must
surely
be
travelling
up
the
river
trappers
going
out
over
their
lines
of
traps
hunters
seeking
caribou
prospectors
starting
away
over
the
trail
for
a
fresh
search
for
the
ever
illusive
yellow
gold
surely
all
these
would
have
left
a
well
beaten
trail
yet
since
the
last
snow
there
had
not
been
a
single
team
passing
that
way
it
s
like
a
village
of
the
dead
she
mused
and
shivered
at
the
thought
when
at
last
she
rounded
a
turn
and
came
within
full
sight
of
the
place
from
which
the
enchanting
tones
issued
the
sight
that
met
her
eyes
caused
her
to
start
back
and
stare
with
surprise
and
amazement
she
had
expected
to
find
a
cluster
of
log
cabins
a
store
a
church
and
a
school
instead
she
saw
a
yawning
hole
in
a
bank
of
snow
a
hole
that
was
doubtless
an
entrance
to
some
sort
of
structure
whether
the
structure
was
built
of
sod
logs
or
merely
of
snow
she
could
not
guess
some
thirty
feet
from
this
entrance
and
higher
apparently
perched
on
the
crust
of
snow
were
two
such
cupola
affairs
as
marian
had
seen
on
certain
types
of
sailing
vessels
and
gasoline
schooners
from
these
there
streamed
a
pale
yellow
light
well
she
exclaimed
well
of
all
things
for
a
moment
undecided
whether
to
flee
from
that
strange
place
she
stood
stock
still
the
organ
for
the
moment
was
stilled
the
woods
were
silent
such
a
hush
as
she
had
never
experienced
in
all
her
life
lay
over
all
then
faint
indistinct
came
a
single
note
of
music
someone
had
touched
a
key
the
next
instant
the
world
seemed
filled
with
the
most
wonderful
melody
s
she
whispered
as
she
stood
there
enchanted
of
all
pipe
organ
music
she
loved
handel
s
largo
best
throughout
the
rendering
of
the
entire
selection
she
stood
as
one
enchanted
it
is
enough
she
said
when
the
sound
of
the
last
note
had
died
away
in
the
tree
tops
it
s
all
very
mysterious
but
any
person
who
can
play
s
like
that
is
not
going
to
be
unkind
to
two
girls
who
are

an
old
man
of
the
north
having
walked
resolutely
to
the
black
hole
in
the
snow
bank
marian
looked
within
there
was
no
door
merely
an
opening
here
a
dim
lamp
in
the
distance
sent
an
uncertain
and
ghostly
light
down
the
corridor
by
this
light
she
made
out
numerous
posts
and
saw
that
a
narrow
ran
between
them
there
was
something
so
mysterious
about
the
place
that
she
hesitated
on
the
threshold
at
that
moment
a
thought
flashed
through
her
mind
a
startling
and
disheartening
thought
radio
she
murmured
nothing
but
she
was
convinced
in
an
instant
that
her
solution
of
the
origin
of
the
wonderful
music
was
correct
the
persons
who
lived
in
this
strange
dwelling
which
reminded
her
of
pictures
she
had
seen
of
the
dens
and
caves
of
robbers
and
brigands
had
somehow
come
into
possession
of
a
powerful
radio
receiving
set
somewhere
in
nome
or
fairbanks
or
perhaps
even
in
noted
musician
was
giving
an
organ
recital
this
radio
set
with
its
loud
speaker
had
picked
up
the
music
and
had
faithfully
reproduced
it
that
was
all
there
was
to
the
mystery
there
was
no
pipe
organ
no
skillful
musician
out
here
in
the
forest
wilderness
it
had
been
stupid
of
her
to
think
there
might
be
this
revelation
for
revelation
it
surely
seemed
to
be
was
both
disappointing
and
disturbing
disappointing
because
in
her
soul
she
had
hoped
to
discover
here
in
the
wilderness
a
thing
that
to
all
appearances
could
not
modern
miracle
disturbing
it
was
too
for
since
a
mere
instrument
a
has
no
soul
the
character
of
the
person
who
operated
it
might
be
anything
at
all
she
could
not
conceive
of
the
person
who
actually
touched
the
keys
and
caused
that
divine
music
to
pour
forth
as
a
villain
any
sort
of
person
however
might
snap
on
the
switch
that
sends
such
music
vibrating
from
the
horn
of
the
loud
speaker
of
a
radiophone
for
a
full
five
minutes
she
wavered
between
two
courses
of
action
to
go
on
inside
this
den
or
to
go
back
to
attatak
and
attempt
to
pass
it
unobserved
perhaps
it
was
the
touch
of
a
finger
on
what
she
supposed
to
be
a
far
off
resuming
of
the
music
perhaps
it
was
her
own
utter
weariness
that
decided
her
at
last
whatever
it
was
she
set
a
resolute
foot
inside
the
entrance
and
the
next
instant
found
herself
carefully
picking
her
way
down
the
dark
passage
toward
the
dim
lamp
to
her
surprise
when
she
at
last
reached
the
lamp
that
hung
over
a
door
she
found
not
an
oil
lamp
but
a
small
electric
light
bulb
will
marvels
never
cease
she
whispered
for
a
second
she
hesitated
should
she
knock
she
hated
spying
yet
the
door
stood
invitingly
ajar
if
the
persons
within
did
not
appear
to
be
the
sort
of
persons
a
girl
might
trust
if
she
could
see
them
and
remain
unobserved
there
was
still
opportunity
for
flight
acting
upon
this
impulse
she
peered
through
the
crack
in
the
door
imagine
her
surprise
upon
seeing
at
the
far
end
of
a
long
heavily
timbered
room
not
a
radio
horn
but
a
pipe
organ
so
she
breathed
my
first
thought
was
right
that
enchanting
music
produced
on
the
spot
and
by
such
a
musician
seated
with
his
side
toward
her
was
the
bent
figure
of
an
old
man
his
long
flowing
white
beard
his
snowy
locks
the
dreamy
look
upon
his
face
as
his
fingers
drifted
back
and
forth
across
the
keys
reminded
her
of
pictures
she
had
seen
of
ancient
bards
playing
upon
golden
harps
harp
of
the
north
that
mouldering
long
has
hung
she
recited
in
a
low
voice
the
fingers
on
the
keys
suddenly
ceased
their
drifting
the
dreamy
look
faded
from
the
musician
s
face
a
smile
lighted
his
eyes
as
turning
about
he
spoke
in
a
cheery
voice
come
in
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
you
are
welcome
to
an
old
man
s
lonely
house
doubly
welcome
coming
as
you
do
in
time
for
sunday
this
strange
almost
uncanny
proceeding
so
startled
the
girl
that
for
a
second
she
was
tempted
to
turn
and
flee
the
next
second
she
had
complete
control
of
herself
pushing
the
door
open
as
if
entering
the
chamber
of
the
king
of
fairies
she
made
a
little
bow
and
said
thank
then
realizing
how
perfectly
absurd
her
action
had
been
she
broke
into
a
hearty
laugh
and
in
this
laugh
the
old
man
joined
so
with
the
ice
broken
they
became
friends
at
once
to
her
vast
relief
she
found
that
the
old
man
though
he
had
undoubtedly
been
expecting
them
or
someone
else
did
not
know
all
about
them
he
asked
if
they
travelled
with
dog
team
or
reindeer
upon
being
told
that
they
drove
reindeer
he
smiled
and
said
good
it
s
lucky
i
have
feed
for
your
deer
reindeer
people
seldom
come
this
way
once
i
was
caught
unprepared
to
entertain
them
so
last
autumn
i
put
in
a
good
stock
of
moss
and
willow
leaves
your
deer
shall
be
safely
housed
and
richly
fed
and
so
shall
you
go
bring
them
at
once
or
shall
i
go
with
you
oh
no
that
is
not
necessary
marian
hastened
to
assure
him
very
well
then
while
you
go
i
will
put
the
birds
on
to
broil
you
are
doubtless
very
ten
minutes
later
marian
was
chattering
to
attatak
the
queerest
place
you
ever
saw
and
the
strangest
old
gentleman
but
really

think
he

the
barrier
the
curiosity
of
the
two
girls
knew
no
bounds
as
they
neared
the
strange
abode
who
was
this
man
why
did
he
live
here
all
by
himself
how
had
he
brought
his
pipe
organ
to
this
remote
spot
whence
had
come
those
peculiar
skylights
through
which
the
yellow
light
gleamed
whence
came
the
power
for
those
electric
lights
how
had
this
strange
man
known
of
their
coming
or
had
he
known
had
he
been
expecting
someone
else
and
had
he
as
a
perfect
host
pretended
it
was
marian
he
had
known
to
be
at
the
door
these
and
many
other
questions
flashed
through
marian
s
alert
mind
as
she
guided
her
deer
over
the
remaining
distance
and
up
to
the
entrance
to
the
structure
lights
flashed
on
here
and
there
as
they
passed
inside
a
long
corridor
walled
on
either
side
by
hewn
logs
led
to
a
room
where
was
food
in
abundance
for
their
reindeer
and
what
was
better
still
perfect
protection
from
any
night
prowler
marian
was
wondering
what
sort
of
meal
was
being
prepared
for
them
when
they
were
at
last
led
into
the
large
room
here
on
the
side
opposite
the
pipe
organ
great
logs
crackled
merrily
in
a
fireplace
half
as
wide
as
the
room
itself
after
taking
their
fur
parkas
the
host
motioned
them
to
seats
beside
the
fire
there
charmed
by
the
drowsy
warmth
marian
experienced
great
difficulty
in
keeping
awake
strange
fancies
floated
through
her
mind
she
fancied
she
was
aboard
a
ship
at
sea
the
walls
about
her
were
the
walls
of
her
the
huge
beams
above
the
ship
s
beams
the
strange
cupola
affairs
above
the
lights
to
her
cabin
as
she
shook
herself
free
from
this
fancy
she
realized
that
aside
from
the
fireplace
the
inside
of
the
room
was
very
like
a
cabin
of
a
high
class
schooner
it
must
all
come
from
some
vessel
she
reasoned
even
the
lighting
fixtures
look
as
if
they
had
been
taken
from
a
ship
i
wonder
what
ship
and
why
she
thought
of
stories
she
had
read
of
beach
combers
who
wrecked
ships
by
displaying
fake
shore
lights
on
stormy
nights
that
they
might
gather
the
wreckage
from
the
beach
for
a
moment
she
fancied
this
bearded
patriarch
playing
such
a
role
finding
this
too
absurd
even
for
fancy
she
shook
herself
free
from
it
food
she
murmured
to
herself
i
m
ravenously
hungry
he
spoke
of
putting
on
the
birds
i
wonder
what
he
could
have
meant
she
did
not
have
long
to
wait
a
moment
later
there
came
to
her
nostrils
the
delicious
aroma
of
perfectly
brewed
coffee
mingled
with
it
were
various
savory
odors
which
gave
promise
of
a
rich
meal
you
are
not
yet
fully
warmed
said
their
host
so
you
may
eat
by
the
he
was
pushing
before
him
a
of
wonderful
design
and
craftsmanship
this
was
fairly
creaking
under
its
load
of
chinaware
of
exquisite
design
and
silver
which
did
not
require
a
second
look
to
tell
that
it
was
sterling
marian
barely
avoided
a
gasp
at
sight
of
it
if
the
service
was
perfect
the
food
was
no
less
so
four
ptarmigan
those
wonderful
quail
of
the
arctic
broiled
to
a
delicious
turn
were
flanked
with
potatoes
gravy
peas
and
apple
sauce
the
desert
was
blueberries
preserved
in
wild
honey
only
idleness
or
indifference
smiled
their
host
as
he
caught
their
looks
of
appreciation
can
hinder
one
from
securing
appetizing
foods
in
any
and
now
he
said
as
they
finished
there
are
questions
you
may
wish
to
ask
information
that
you
may
wish
to
marian
began
in
some
confusion
he
interrupted
her
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
it
will
all
keep
until
morning
this
habit
young
people
have
of
sitting
up
talking
all
hours
of
the
night
because
life
seems
too
exciting
for
sleep
is
all
wrong
you
are
in
need
of
rest
everything
in
its
good
time
is
my
motto
fortunately
my

is
warm
the
fire
is
not

burned
out
last
night
i
had
the
honor
of
furnishing
a
night

lodging
to
the
agent
of

the

marian
asked
in
surprise
yes
he
came
up
here
to
ask
me
about
the
lay
of
the
land
above
here
i
think
there
was
a
merry
twinkle
in
his
eye
that
i
may
lay
claim
to
being
the
oldest
resident
of
this
town
no
doubt
i
was
able
to
give
him
some
valuable
and
he
gone

this
morning
why
did
you
wish
to
see
him
you
would
being
connected
with
the
reindeer
business
you
would
unfortunate
that
you
did
not
reach
here
a
few
hours
earlier
he
left
on
foot
the
trail
around
the
rapids
is
rough
he
did
not
try
to
bring
his
dogs
and
sleds
through
left
them
with
his
driver
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
well
enough
that
he
did
couldn
t
have
made
upon
realizing
that
she
had
missed
the
man
she
had
come
so
far
to
see
marian
could
have
burst
into
tears
you
may
find
him
at
the
station
though
her
host
assured
her
i
believe
he
means
to
stay
there
a
day
or
two
his
dogs
are
footsore
from
travelling
over
crusted
marian
s
heart
gave
a
leap
of
joy
but
what
was
this
about
the
trail
and
the
rapids
you
say
that
one
could
not
pass
over
the
trail
with
a
sled
she
asked
in
the
calmest
tone
she
could
command
are
the
rapids
not
yet
frozen
over
frozen
he
stared
at
her
incredulously
have
you
not
heard
them
ah
then
you
came
from
up
stream
the
forest
shuts
out
the
sound
slip
on
your
parka
and
come
with
me
and
you
shall
hear
it
is
grand
music
that
ceaseless
rush
and
roar
that
beating
of
waters
and
tumbling
of
it
may
have
seemed
glorious
to
the
old
man
but
to
marian
who
listened
to
the
wild
tumult
of
waters
it
was
frightening
and
disheartening
can
a
boat
run
the
rapids
she
asked
though
she
knew
the
question
was
foolish
and
that
no
boat
could
run
them
none
ever
a
sled
pass
over
the
trail
above
none
has
none
can
the
way
is
too
rough
the

too
closely
crowded
together

reindeer
men
yes
but
sleds
how
far
is
it
to
the
station
marian
faltered
three
days
are
there
any
houses
on
the
way
then
without
our
sleds
we
would
not
dare
undertake
the
no
it
would
not
do
you
would
starve
or
it
required
all
marian
s
power
of
will
to
remain
standing
as
she
faltering
said
then
we
are
defeated
must
turn
back
she
could
not
go
on
the
aged
man
studied
her
face
for
a
moment
then
quietly
he
asked
is
it
very
important
that
you
get
to
the
station
that
you
see
the
agent
oh
very
very
important
again
he
motioned
for
silence
do
not
tell
me
now
i
think
it
can
be
arranged
that
your
sleds
may
pass
the
rapids
it
be
arranged
i
promise
it

you
are
worn
out
it
is

you
should

their

was
stowed
away
in

bags
when

had
lighted

to

room

was
to
be
theirs
for
the
night
and
had
retired
to

unlashed
their
sleeping
bags
and
carried
them
as
they
were
to

room
for
some
hours
marian
had
not
thought
of
the
ancient
treasure
found
in
the
cave
but
once
she
began
unrolling
her
sleeping
bag
she
was
reminded
of
it
a
piece
of
old
ivory
went
clattering
to
the
floor
with
a
cry
of
surprise
she
picked
it
up
then
carefully
removed
the
other
pieces
of
ivory
copper
and
ancient
pottery
and
stood
them
in
a
row
against
the
wall
again
there
came
the
temptation
to
give
them
a
thorough
examination
events
transpired
later
that
caused
her
to
wish
that
she
had
done
so
but
weary
and
troubled
by
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
she
again
put
off
this
inviting
task
she
slipped
at
once
into
her
sleeping
gown
and
plunged
beneath
the
covers
of
the
most
delightful
bed
she
had
ever
known
attatak
followed
her
a
few
seconds
later
they
found
themselves
lying
upon
a
bed
of
springy
moss
mixed
with
the
fragrant
tips
of
balsam
over
this
had
been
thrown
wolfskin
robes
with
one
of
these
beneath
them
and
two
above
they
snuggled
down
until
only
their
noses
were
showing
they
did
not
sleep
at
once
left
to
himself
the
mysterious
old
man
had
seated
himself
at
his
organ
and
now
sent
forth
such
wild
pealing
tones
as
marian
had
never
heard
before
he
was
doing
dvorjak
s
wildest
symphony
and
making
it
wilder
and
more
weird
than
even
the
composer
himself
could
have
dreamed
it
might
be
made
throughout
its
rendition
marian
lay
tense
as
a
as
it
ended
with
a
wild
racing
crash
she
settled
back
with
a
shiver
wondering
what
could
throw
such
a
spell
over
an
old
man
as
would
cause
him
to
play
in
that
manner
had
she
known
the
reason
she
would
have
done
little
sleeping
that
night
the
aged
host
was
tuning
his
soul
to
such
a
key
as
would
nerve
him
for
a
herculean
task
since
marian
did
not
know
she
puzzled
for
a
time
over
the
trail
they
must
travel
in
the
morning
wondered
vaguely
how
her
host
was
to
keep
his
promise
of
bringing
their
sleds
safely
past
the
rapids
then
fell
asleep
as
for
their
host
fifteen
minutes
after
the
last
note
of
his
wild
symphony
had
died
away
he
down
the
silent
corridor
which
led
to
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
girls
were
sleeping
having
convinced
himself
by
a
moment
of
listening
that
they
were
asleep
he
made
his
way
to
the
spot
where
their
two
sleds
had
been
left
these
he
examined
carefully
after
straightening
up
he
murmured
took
their
that
s
bad
didn
t
need
em
can
t
disturb
em
now
guess
it
can
be
after
delivering
himself
of
this
monologue
he
proceeded
to
wrap
the
contents
of
each
sled
in
a
blanket
then
dragged
them
out
into
the
moonlight
having
strapped
an
axe
a
pick
and
a
shovel
on
one
sled
he
tied
the
other
sled
to
it
and
began
pulling
them
over
the
smooth
downhill
trail
that
led
toward
the
falls
for
a
full
mile
he
plodded
stolidly
on
then
he
halted
separated
the
sleds
and
with
the
foremost
sled
gliding
on
before
him
plunged
down
a
steep
bank
to
the
right
presently
he
came
toiling
back
up
the
hill
for
the
other
sled
at
the
bottom
once
more
he
stood
for
a
moment
staring
into
the
foaming
depths
of
a
roaring
torrent
pretty
bad
he
muttered
never
did
it
before
at
this
time
of
year
might
fail
suddenly
he
broke
off
and
began
humming
he
was
going
over
and
over
that
mad
symphony
it
appeared
to
give
him
strength
and
courage
and
seizing
the
pick
he
began
hacking
away
at
some
object
that
lay
half
buried
in
the
snow
fifteen
minutes
later
he
had
exhumed
a
short
square
raft
built
you
for
other
purposes
but
you
ll
do
for
this
he
muttered
other
logs
where
you
came
he
set
both
sleds
carefully
upon
the
raft
then
with
yards
upon
yards
of
rawhide
rope
lashed
them
solidly
to
it
this
done
he
began
running
out
a
heavier
rope
this
he
carried
up
the
bank
to
a
spot
where
there
was
a
mass
of
jagged
rock
covered
here
and
there
by
hard
packed
snow
more
than
once
he
slipped
but
always
he
struggled
upward
until
at
last
he
stood
upon
the
topmost
pinnacle
a
heroic
figure
silhouetted
in
the
moonlight
he
stood
for
a
full
five
minutes
staring
down
at
the
racing
waters
below
dancing
in
the
moonlight
they
appeared
to
reach
out
black
hands
to
grasp
and
drag
him
down
before
him
on
the
opposite
side
gleamed
a
high
white
bank
a
sheer
precipice
of
ice
fifty
feet
high
this
was
the
end
of
a
glacier
that
every
now
and
again
sent
a
thousand
tons
of
ice
thundering
into
the
deep
pool
at
its
foot
beneath
this
ice
barrier
the
water
had
worn
a
channel
a
boat
drifting
down
on
the
rushing
waters
would
certainly
be
sucked
down
beneath
this
ice
and
be
crushed
like
an
eggshell
what
the
old
man
intended
to
do
was
evident
enough
he
meant
to
set
the
raft
laden
with
the
sleds
and
trappings
so
precious
to
his
young
guests
afloat
in
those
turbulent
waters
and
then
to
attempt
by
means
of
the
rope
to
hold
it
from
being
drawn
beneath
the
ice
and
to
guide
it
a
half
mile
down
the
river
to
quieter
waters
below
there
was
no
path
for
him
to
follow
jagged
rocks
and
snow
slippery
as
glass
awaited
him
yet
he
dared
to
try
it
here
was
a
task
fit
for
the
youngest
and
the
strongest
yet
there
he
stood
the
spirit
of
a
hero
flowing
in
his
serving
youth
the
gallantry
of
a
great
and
perfect
gentleman
bowing
to
fair
ladies
and
daring
all
how
marian
would
have
thrilled
at
sight
of
this
daring
act
with
a
swift
turn
he
tightened
the
rope
then
with
the
of
his
symphony
upon
his
lips
strained
every
muscle
until
he
felt
the
rope
slack
then
eased
away
as
he
saw
the
raft
tilt
for
the
glide
then
he
relaxed
his
muscles
and
stood
there
watching
with
a
slow
graceful
movement
the
small
raft
glided
out
upon
the
water
an
eddy
seized
it
and
whirled
it
about
three
times
it
turned
then
the
current
caught
it
and
whirled
it
away
the
rope
was
tight
now
and
every
muscle
of
the
grand
old
man
was
tense
a
battle
had
begun
which
was
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
two
girls
were
to
reach
the
station
and
fulfill
their
mission
chapter
xviii
the
trail
of
blood
that
same
evening
patsy
made
her
second
startling
discovery
an
hour
before
night
was
to
set
in
she
had
harnessed
a
sled
deer
and
struck
out
into
the
hills
in
search
of
a
brown
yearling
that
had
been
missing
for
two
days
strange
where
they
all
go
she
murmured
as
she
climbed
a
hill
for
a
better
view
of
the
surrounding
country
marian
was
right
unless
we
discover
the
cause
of
these
disappearances
and
put
an
end
to
them
soon
there
will
be
no
herd
it
s
a
shame
how
i
wish
i
could
make
the
discovery
all
by
myself
and
surprise
marian
with
the
good
news
when
she
gets
as
she
scanned
the
horizon
away
across
to
the
west
she
saw
a
single
dark
figure
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
old
she
said
taking
in
with
admiration
the
full
sweep
of
his
splendid
antlers
it
s
the
first
time
i
ve
seen
him
for
a
long
while
we
can
t
lose
you
can
we
and
we
can
t
catch
you
she
said
speaking
to
the
lone
figure
old
was
neither
reindeer
nor
caribou
at
least
this
was
what
marian
had
said
about
it
she
believed
that
he
was
a
reindeer
and
half
caribou
he
was
large
like
a
caribou
larger
than
the
largest
deer
in
the
herd
he
had
something
of
the
dark
brown
coat
of
the
caribou
but
a
bright
white
spot
on
his
left
side
told
of
the
reindeer
blood
that
flowed
in
his
veins
but
he
was
very
wild
haunting
the
edge
of
the
herd
he
never
came
close
enough
to
be
lassoed
or
driven
into
a
brush
corral
many
a
wild
chase
had
he
lead
the
herders
but
always
he
had
shown
them
his
sleek
brown
heels
many
times
the
girls
had
debated
the
question
of
allowing
the
herders
to
kill
him
for
food
and
for
his
splendid
coat
yet
they
had
hesitated
they
were
not
sure
that
he
was
not
a
reindeer
that
he
was
not
marked
and
did
not
belong
to
someone
if
he
was
a
stray
reindeer
they
had
no
right
to
kill
him
besides
this
it
seemed
a
pity
to
kill
such
a
wonderful
creature
so
the
matter
stood
and
here
he
was
on
their
feeding
ground
as
patsy
stood
there
gazing
at
this
splendid
creature
she
slowly
realized
that
the
arctic
sun
had
flamed
down
below
the
far
horizon
and
long
shadows
raced
out
of
the
west
a
full
orbed
moon
stood
just
atop
the
trees
that
lined
the
eastern
rim
of
hills
turning
reluctantly
to
leave
her
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
dark
spot
in
the
snow
she
bent
over
to
examine
it
and
a
moment
later
straightened
up
with
a
startled
exclamation
blood
it
is
a
trail
of
blood
i
wonder
which
way
it
goes
unable
to
answer
this
question
she
decided
to
circle
until
she
could
find
some
sign
that
would
tell
her
whether
or
not
she
was
satisfied
at
last
of
the
direction
she
pushed
on
and
there
in
the
eerie
moonlight
through
the
ghostly
silence
of
an
arctic
night
she
silently
followed
the
trail
of
blood
suddenly
she
stopped
and
stood
still
just
before
her
was
a
large
discoloration
of
the
snow
and
though
the
snow
was
so
wind
packed
that
she
walked
on
it
without
snowshoes
her
keen
eyes
detected
spots
where
it
had
been
broken
and
scratched
by
some
hard
heavy
object
dropping
on
her
knees
she
began
examining
every
detail
of
the
markings
when
she
arose
she
spoke
with
a
quiet
tone
of
conviction
this
is
the
track
of
a
man
he
has
killed
one
of
our
deer
and
had
been
carrying
it
on
his
shoulder
blood
dropped
from
the
still
warm
carcass
that
explains
the
trail
of
blood
the
load
has
become
too
heavy
for
him
at
this
spot
he
has
laid
his
burden
down
in
places
the
antlers
have
scratched
the
snow
after
a
time
he
has
gone
on
but
which
way
did
he
go
once
more
she
bent
over
on
the
hard
packed
snow
the
sole
of
a
skin
boot
makes
no
tracks
after
a
moment
s
study
she
again
straightened
up
there
s
a
long
scratch
as
if
he
had
dragged
the
carcass
to
his
shoulder
as
he
started
on
and
an
antler
had
dragged
for
two
or
three
feet
that
would
indicate
that
he
went
the
way
i
have
been
going
question
is
shall
i
go
farther
or
shall
i
go
for
the
herders
with
their
rifles
she
decided
to
go
on
the
blood
spots
grew
less
and
less
as
she
advanced
she
was
beginning
to
despair
of
being
able
to
follow
much
farther
when
with
a
startled
gesture
she
came
to
a
sudden
halt
the
purple
flame
she
said
in
an
awed
whisper
it
was
true
as
she
stared
down
at
a
little
willow
lined
valley
she
saw
the
outline
of
a
tent
from
the
very
center
of
it
there
appeared
to
burst
that
weird
purple
light
well
she
concluded
i
am
at
least
sure
that
they
ve
killed
one
of
our
deer
killed
several
probably
no
doubt
they
have
been
living
off
our
for
a
moment
she
stood
there
undecided
then
with
reluctant
feet
she
turned
back
it
was
the
only
wise
thing
to
do
she
was
alone
and
unarmed
to
follow
that
trail
further
would
be
dangerous
and
foolhardy
but
what
should
she
do
once
she
had
reached
her
own
camp
she
was
convinced
in
her
own
mind
that
the
slain
creature
was
one
of
their
deer
yet
she
could
not
prove
it
should
she
lead
her
armed
herders
to
the
stranger
s
tent
and
demand
an
explanation
oh
how
she
did
wish
that
marian
was
here
as
she
walked
homeward
she
felt
terribly
depressed
there
was
a
girl
in
that
tent
of
the
purple
flame
she
had
seen
her
she
had
hoped
that
sometime
in
the
not
too
distant
future
they
might
be
friends
such
a
friend
in
this
lonely
land
especially
since
marian
and
attatak
were
gone
would
be
a
boon
indeed
now
she
felt
that
such
a
thing
could
never
be
it
was
as
if
a
great
gulf
had
suddenly
yawned
between
them
after
reaching
her
camp
and
sipping
a
cup
of
tea
and
munching
at
some
hard
crackers
she
sat
for
hours
thinking
things
through
her
final
decision
was
that
for
the
present
she
could
do
nothing
marian
might
return
any
day
now
in
such
matters
her
judgment
would
be
best
and
patsy
did
not
feel
warranted
in
starting
what
might
prove
to
be
a
dangerous
feud
chapter
xix
passing
the
rapids
as
the
raft
which
had
been
dragged
from
the
bank
of
the
river
by
the
hermit
of
the
mysterious
lodge
swung
out
into
the
ice
strewn
current
it
shot
directly
for
the
glacier
s
end
as
if
drawn
by
a
magnet
taking
a
quick
turn
of
the
rope
about
a
point
of
rock
the
aged
man
braced
himself
for
the
shock
which
must
come
when
the
raft
with
its
load
of
sleds
and
other
trappings
had
taken
up
the
slack
all
too
soon
it
came
bracing
himself
as
best
he
could
he
held
his
ground
the
strain
increased
it
seemed
that
the
rope
must
snap
that
the
old
man
s
iron
grip
must
yield
should
the
raft
reach
the
glacier
it
would
be
lost
forever
the
muscles
in
the
man
s
arms
played
like
bands
of
steel
blood
vessels
stood
out
on
his
temples
like
whipcords
yet
he
held
his
ground
ten
seconds
passed
twenty
thirty
then
with
a
whirl
like
some
wild
animal
yielding
to
its
captor
the
raft
swung
about
and
shot
away
down
stream
plunging
forward
leaping
rocks
gliding
over
glassy
surfaces
of
snow
puffing
perspiring
the
old
man
followed
now
he
was
down
the
cause
seemed
lost
but
in
a
flash
he
was
up
again
clutching
at
a
jagged
rock
that
tore
his
hand
for
a
second
time
he
stayed
the
mad
rush
of
the
raft
then
he
was
on
again
bobbing
from
reef
to
reef
plunging
through
foam
leaping
high
above
the
torrents
the
raft
went
careering
on
twice
it
all
but
turned
over
and
but
for
the
skill
of
its
master
would
have
been
crushed
by
great
grinding
cakes
of
ice
for
thirty
long
minutes
the
battle
lasted
minutes
that
seemed
hours
to
the
aged
man
then
with
a
sigh
he
guided
the
raft
into
a
safe
eddy
of
water
sinking
down
upon
a
hard
packed
bank
of
snow
he
lay
there
as
if
dead
for
a
long
time
he
lay
there
then
rising
stiffly
made
his
way
down
the
ledge
to
drag
the
raft
ashore
and
unlash
the
sleds
after
this
he
drew
the
sleds
up
the
hill
one
at
a
time
and
set
them
across
the
blazed
trail
there
he
sighed
a
good
night
s
work
done
and
a
neat
one
i
could
not
have
done
it
better
twenty
years
ago
grow
old
along
with
me
he
threw
back
his
hair
as
if
in
defiance
of
raging
torrents
the
best
is
yet
to
be
the
last
of
life
for
which
the
first
was
having
delivered
this
bit
of
poetical
oration
to
the
tune
of
the
booming
rapids
he
turned
to
pick
his
way
back
over
the
uncertain
trail
that
led
to
his
strange
abode
eight
hours
after
she
had
crept
into
the
luxurious
bed
in
the
guest
room
of
the
strange
lodge
marian
stirred
then
half
awake
felt
the
drowsy
warmth
of
rugs
for
a
moment
she
lay
there
and
inhaled
the
perfume
of
balsam
and
listened
to
the
steady
breathing
of
the
eskimo
girl
beside
her
she
was
about
to
turn
over
for
another
sleep
when
from
some
cell
of
her
brain
where
it
had
been
stowed
the
night
before
there
came
the
urge
that
told
her
she
must
make
haste
haste
haste
haste
came
beating
in
upon
her
drowsy
senses
it
was
as
if
her
brain
were
a
radio
and
the
message
was
coming
from
the
air
suddenly
she
sat
bolt
upright
at
the
same
instant
she
found
herself
wide
awake
fully
alert
and
conscious
of
the
problems
she
must
face
that
passing
of
the
rapids
and
covering
a
long
span
of
that
trail
which
still
lay
between
them
and
their
goal
she
did
not
waken
attatak
that
might
not
be
necessary
for
another
hour
she
sprang
out
upon
the
heavy
bear
skin
rug
and
there
went
through
a
set
of
wild
whirling
gestures
that
limbered
every
muscle
in
her
body
and
sent
the
red
blood
racing
through
her
veins
after
that
she
quickly
slipped
into
her
blouse
knickers
stockings
and
deerskin
boots
to
at
last
go
tiptoeing
down
the
corridor
toward
the
large
where
she
heard
the
roar
of
the
open
fire
as
it
raced
up
the
chimney
she
found
her
host
sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
uncertain
light
he
appeared
haggard
and
worn
as
if
quite
done
in
from
some
great
exertion
of
course
marian
could
not
so
much
as
guess
how
he
had
spent
the
night
she
had
slept
through
it
all
with
a
smile
of
greeting
the
old
man
motioned
her
to
a
seat
beside
him
you
ll
not
begrudge
an
old
man
a
half
hour
s
company
he
said
indeed
you
ll
wish
to
ask
me
things
everyone
who
passes
this
way
wants
to
mostly
they
ask
and
i
don
t
tell
a
fair
lady
though
there
was
something
of
ancient
gallantry
in
his
tone
fair
ladies
usually
ask
what
they
will
and
get
it
for
a
moment
he
sat
staring
silently
into
the
fire
this
house
he
said
at
last
is
a
bit
unusual
that
pipe
organ
for
wouldn
t
expect
it
here
it
came
here
as
if
by
accident
providence
i
call
it
a
rich
young
man
had
more
things
than
he
knew
what
to
do
with
the
creator
sent
some
of
them
to
me
as
for
me
i
came
here
voluntarily
you
have
probably
taken
me
for
a
prospector
i
have
never
bought
pick
nor
pan
there
are
things
that
lure
me
but
gold
is
not
one
of
them
i
had
troubles
before
i
came
here
troubles
are
the
heritage
of
the
aged
i
sometimes
think
that
it
is
not
well
to
live
too
long
and
yet
he
shook
himself
free
of
the
mood
his
face
lighting
up
as
he
exclaimed
and
yet
life
is
very
wonderful
wonderful
even
up
here
in
the
frozen
north
i
might
almost
say
here
in
the
north
i
came
here
to
be
alone
i
brought
in
food
with
a
dog
team
i
built
a
cabin
of
logs
and
here
i
lived
for
a
year
one
day
a
young
man
came
up
the
river
in
a
wonderful
pleasure
yacht
and
anchored
at
the
foot
of
the
rapids
being
a
lover
of
music
he
had
built
a
pipe
organ
into
his
yacht
the
one
you
heard
last
and
he
die
marian
asked
a
little
break
coming
in
her
voice
no
the
old
man
smiled
he
tarried
too
long
being
a
lover
of
hunter
and
an
expert
having
found
the
most
ideal
spot
in
the
world
as
long
as
summer
lasted
he
stayed
on
after
the
frosts
and
the
first
snow
i
was
away
at
the
time
else
i
would
have
warned
him
i
returned
the
day
after
it
happened
there
had
been
a
heavy
freeze
far
up
the
river
then
a
storm
came
that
broke
the
ice
away
the
ice
came
racing
down
over
the
rapids
like
mad
and
wrecked
his
wonderful
yacht
beyond
all
repair
we
did
as
much
as
we
could
about
getting
the
parts
on
shore
saved
almost
all
but
the
hull
he
stayed
with
me
for
a
few
days
then
becoming
restless
traded
me
all
there
was
left
of
his
boat
for
my
dog
team
that
winter
with
the
help
of
three
indians
and
their
dogs
i
brought
the
wreckage
up
here
gradually
little
by
little
i
have
arranged
it
into
the
form
of
a
home
that
is
as
much
like
a
boat
as
a
house
the
organ
was
unimpaired
and
here
it
sings
to
me
every
day
of
the
great
white
he
ceased
speaking
and
for
a
long
time
was
silent
when
he
spoke
again
his
tones
were
mellow
with
kindness
and
a
strange
joy
i
am
seldom
lonely
now
the
woods
and
waters
are
full
of
interesting
secrets
travellers
like
you
come
this
way
now
and
again
i
try
to
be
prepared
to
serve
them
to
be
their
i
ask
one
question
marian
suggested
timidly
as
many
as
you
how
did
you
know
i
was
at
the
door
last
night
when
you
were
playing
you
did
not
see
me
you
couldn
t
have
heard
that
he
smiled
is
a
question
i
should
like
to
ask
someone
myself
someone
much
wiser
than
i
am
i
knew
you
were
there
i
had
been
feeling
your
presence
for
more
than
an
hour
before
you
came
i
knew
i
had
an
audience
i
was
playing
for
them
how
did
i
know
i
can
not
tell
it
has
often
been
so
before
perhaps
all
human
presence
can
be
felt
by
some
specially
endowed
persons
it
may
be
that
in
the
throngs
of
great
cities
the
message
of
soul
to
soul
is
lost
just
as
a
radio
message
is
lost
in
a
jumble
of
many
messages
sent
at
once
but
then
he
laughed
why
speculate
life
s
too
short
some
things
we
must
accept
as
they
are
what
s
more
important
to
you
is
that
your
sleds
are
beyond
the
rapids
when
breakfast
is
over
you
can
strap
your
sleeping
bags
on
your
deer
and
i
will
guide
you
over
the
trail
around
the
rapids
to
the
point
where
i
left
your
a
look
of
consternation
flashed
over
marian
s
face
she
was
thinking
of
the
ancient
dishes
and
how
fragile
they
were
i
have
some
fragile
articles
in
the
sleeping
bags
she
said
might
break
break
he
wore
a
puzzled
look
for
a
second
she
hesitated
then
reassured
by
the
kindly
face
of
the
gentle
old
man
decided
to
tell
him
the
story
of
their
adventure
in
the
cave
then
she
launched
into
the
story
with
all
the
eagerness
of
a
discoverer
i
see
he
said
when
she
had
finished
the
story
i
know
just
how
you
feel
however
there
is
now
only
one
safe
thing
to
do
leave
these
treasures
with
me
if
the
rapids
are
frozen
over
when
the
time
comes
for
the
return
trip
you
can
pass
here
and
get
them
you
ll
always
be
welcome
better
leave
an
address
to
which
they
may
be
sent
in
case
you
should
not
pass
this
way
the
rapids
freeze
over
every
winter
i
will
surely
be
able
to
get
them
off
on
the
first
river
boat
they
can
be
sent
to
any
spot
in
the
world
to
attempt
to
pack
them
over
on
your
deer
would
mean
certain
reluctant
as
marian
was
to
leave
the
treasure
behind
she
saw
the
wisdom
of
his
advice
so
feeling
a
perfect
confidence
in
him
she
decided
to
leave
her
treasure
in
his
care
then
she
gave
him
her
address
at
nome
with
instructions
for
shipping
should
she
fail
to
return
this
way
one
thing
more
i
wanted
to
ask
you
she
said
how
many
men
are
there
at
the
station
one
man
the
trader
he
stays
there
the
year
one
man
she
exclaimed
one
is
all
time
was
when
there
were
twenty
prospectors
traders
indians
trappers
two
years
ago
forest
fires
destroyed
the
timber
the
game
sought
other
feeding
grounds
and
the
trappers
traders
and
indians
went
with
them
gold
doesn
t
seem
to
exist
in
the
streams
hereabouts
so
the
prospectors
have
left
too
now
one
man
keeps
the
post
sort
of
holding
on
i
guess
just
to
see
if
the
old
days
won
t
do
you
suppose
he
leave
for
a
week
or
two
marian
faltered
guess
not
company
wouldn
t
permit
marian
set
her
lips
tight
she
would
not
worry
this
kind
old
man
with
her
troubles
the
fact
remained
however
that
if
there
was
but
one
man
at
the
station
and
he
could
not
leave
there
was
no
one
who
could
be
delegated
by
the
government
agent
to
go
back
with
her
to
help
fight
her
battles
against
scarberry
suddenly
as
she
thought
of
the
weary
miles
they
had
travelled
of
the
hardships
they
had
endured
and
of
the
probability
that
they
would
after
all
fail
in
fulfilling
their
mission
she
felt
very
weak
and
as
one
who
has
suddenly
grown
old
chapter
xx
a
message
from
the
air
a
cup
of
perfect
coffee
followed
by
a
dash
into
the
bracing
arctic
morning
completely
revived
marian
s
spirits
casting
one
longing
look
backward
at
the
mysterious
treasure
of
ancient
dishes
and
old
ivory
throwing
doubt
and
discouragement
to
the
winds
with
energy
and
courage
she
set
herself
to
face
the
problems
of
the
day
the
passing
of
the
rapids
by
the
overland
trail
was
all
that
their
host
had
promised
struggling
over
rocky
slopes
slipping
sliding
buffeted
by
strong
winds
beaten
back
by
swinging
overhanging
branches
of
ancient
spruce
and
firs
they
made
their
way
pantingly
forward
until
at
last
with
a
little
cry
of
joy
marian
saw
their
own
sleds
in
the
trail
ahead
that
s
over
she
breathed
how
thankful
i
am
that
we
did
not
attempt
to
make
it
with
the
sleds
or
with
our
treasure
on
the
backs
of
the
deer
there
would
not
have
been
left
a
fragment
of
our
dishes
as
big
as
a
dime
as
for
the
sleds
well
it
simply
couldn
t
be
sighed
attatak
i
wonder
how
he
could
have
brought
them
by
the
rapids
marian
mused
as
she
examined
the
sleds
there
were
flakes
of
ice
frozen
to
the
runners
she
could
only
guess
at
the
method
he
had
used
only
dimly
picture
the
struggle
it
must
have
taken
even
as
she
attempted
to
picture
the
night
battle
a
great
wave
of
admiration
and
trust
swept
over
her
the
treasure
is
safer
in
his
hands
than
in
ours
she
told
herself
but
after
it
has
left
his
hands
questioned
her
doubting
self
oh
well
she
sighed
at
last
what
must
be
will
be
the
important
thing
after
all
is
to
reach
the
station
before
the
agent
has
started
on
his
again
her
brow
clouded
what
if
there
was
no
one
to
go
back
with
her
to
dispel
this
doubt
she
hastened
to
hitch
her
deer
to
her
sled
soon
they
were
racing
away
over
the
trail
causing
the
last
miles
of
their
long
journey
to
melt
away
like
ice
in
the
river
before
a
spring
thaw
in
the
meantime
a
third
startling
revelation
had
come
to
patsy
first
she
had
discovered
that
at
least
one
of
the
persons
connected
with
the
strange
purple
flame
was
a
girl
next
she
had
found
the
red
trail
of
blood
that
apparently
was
made
by
one
of
marian
s
slain
deer
and
which
led
to
the
door
of
their
tent
the
third
discovery
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
first
two
nor
with
the
purple
flame
it
was
of
a
totally
different
nature
and
was
most
encouraging
if
only
marian
were
here
she
said
to
herself
as
she
paced
the
floor
after
receiving
the
important
message
this
message
came
to
her
over
the
radiophone
it
was
not
meant
particularly
for
her
nor
for
marian
it
was
just
news
not
much
more
than
a
rumor
at
that
yet
such
news
as
it
was
if
only
it
were
true
faint
and
far
away
it
came
drifting
in
upon
the
air
from
some
powerful
sending
station
perhaps
that
station
was
fairbanks
dawson
or
nome
she
missed
that
part
of
the
message
only
this
much
came
to
her
that
night
as
she
sat
at
their
compact
powerful
receiving
set
beguiling
the
lonesome
hours
by
catching
snatches
of
messages
from
near
and
far
rumor
has
it
that
the
canadian
government
plans
the
purchase
of
reindeer
to
be
given
to
her
eskimo
people
on
the
north
coast
of
the
arctic
five
or
six
hundred
will
be
purchased
as
an
experiment
if
the
plan
carries
it
seems
probable
that
the
deer
purchased
will
be
procured
in
alaska
it
is
thought
possible
to
drive
herds
across
the
intervening
space
and
over
the
line
from
alaska
and
that
in
this
way
they
may
be
purchased
by
the
canadian
agent
on
canadian
soil
a
call
for
such
herds
may
be
issued
later
over
the
radio
as
it
is
well
known
that
many
owners
of
herds
have
their
camps
equipped
with
there
the
message
ended
it
had
left
patsy
in
a
fever
of
excitement
marian
and
her
father
wished
to
sell
the
herd
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
sell
it
if
marian
s
hopes
of
continuing
her
education
were
not
to
be
blasted
there
was
no
market
now
for
a
herd
in
alaska
in
the
future
as
pastures
grew
scarcer
and
as
herds
increased
in
numbers
there
would
be
still
less
opportunity
for
a
sale
what
a
wonderful
opportunity
patsy
exclaimed
to
sell
the
whole
herd
to
a
government
that
would
pay
fair
prices
and
cash
and
what
a
glorious
adventure
to
drive
a
reindeer
herd
over
hundreds
of
miles
of
rivers
forests
tundra
hills
and
mountains
to
camp
each
night
in
some
spot
where
perhaps
no
man
has
been
before
surely
that
would
be
wonderful
wonderful
just
at
that
moment
there
entered
her
mind
a
startling
thought
scarberry
s
camp
too
was
equipped
with
a
probably
he
too
at
this
very
moment
was
smiling
at
the
prospect
of
selling
six
hundred
of
his
deer
he
wanted
to
sell
of
course
he
did
everyone
did
he
would
make
the
drive
certainly
he
would
and
then
she
breathed
pressing
her
hands
to
her
fluttering
heart
then
it
will
be
a
race
a
race
between
two
reindeer
herd
a
race
over
hundreds
of
miles
of
wilderness
for
a
grand
prize
what
a
glorious
adventure
if
only
marian
were
here
she
sighed
again
the
message
announcing
the
plans
may
come
while
she
is
gone
she
sat
in
a
study
for
a
long
time
finally
she
whispered
to
herself
if
the
message
comes
while
she
is
gone
if
the
opportunity
is
sure
to
be
lost
unless
the
herd
starts
as
soon
as
the
message
comes
i
wonder
if
i
d
dare
to
start
on
the
race
with
the
herd
with
terogloona
and
without
marian
and
attatak
i
wonder
if
i
would
for
a
long
time
she
sat
staring
at
the
fire
perhaps
she
was
attempting
to
read
the
answer
in
the
flames
at
last
with
cheeks
a
trifle
flushed
she
sprang
to
her
feet
did
three
or
four
leaps
across
the
floor
and
throwing
off
her
clothing
crept
between

the
strange
little
sleeping

chapter
xxi
fading
hopes
just
at
dawn
of
a
wonderfully
crisp
morning
marian
found
herself
following
her
reindeer
over
a
trail
that
had
recently
been
travelled
by
a
dog
team
she
was
just
approaching
the
trading
station
where
the
questions
that
haunted
her
tired
brain
would
be
answered
since
leaving
the
cabin
in
the
forest
above
the
rapids
she
and
attatak
had
travelled
almost
day
and
night
a
half
hour
for
a
hasty
lunch
here
and
there
an
hour
or
two
for
sleep
and
for
permitting
the
deer
to
feed
that
was
all
they
had
allowed
themselves
an
hour
earlier
marian
had
felt
that
she
could
not
travel
another
mile
then
they
had
come
upon
the
trail
of
the
dog
team
and
realizing
that
they
were
nearing
their
goal
her
blood
had
quickened
like
a
marathon
racer
s
at
the
end
of
his
long
race
no
longer
feeling
fatigue
she
urged
her
weary
reindeer
forward
contrary
to
her
usually
cautious
nature
she
even
cast
discretion
to
the
winds
and
drove
her
deer
straight
toward
the
settlement
that
there
were
dogs
which
might
attack
her
deer
she
knew
right
well
that
they
were
not
of
the
species
that
attacked
deer
or
that
they
were
chained
was
her
hope
so
with
her
heart
throbbing
she
rounded
a
sudden
turn
to
find
herself
within
sight
of
a
group
of
cabins
that
at
one
time
had
been
a
small
town
now
as
her
aged
host
had
said
it
was
a
town
in
name
only
she
knew
this
at
a
glance
one
look
at
the
chimneys
told
her
the
place
was
all
but
deserted
no
smoke
she
murmured
yes
one
smoke
attatak
said
pointing
it
was
true
from
one
long
cabin
there
curled
a
white
wreath
of
smoke
for
a
moment
marian
hesitated
no
dogs
had
come
out
to
bark
yet
they
might
be
there
you
stay
with
the
deer
she
said
to
attatak
tether
them
strongly
to
the
sleds
if
dogs
come
beat
them
she
was
away
like
an
arrow
straight
to
that
cabin
of
the
one
smoke
she
hurried
she
caught
her
breath
as
she
saw
a
splendid
team
of
dogs
standing
at
the
door
someone
was
going
on
a
trip
the
sled
was
loaded
for
the
journey
was
it
the
agent
s
sled
had
she
arrived
in
time
she
did
not
have
long
to
wait
before
knowing
she
had
come
within
ten
feet
of
the
cabin
when
a
tall
man
opened
the
door
and
stepped
out
she
caught
her
breath
instantly
she
knew
him
it
was
the
agent
he
in
turn
recognized
her
and
with
cap
in
hand
and
astonishment
showing
in
his
eyes
he
advanced
to
meet
her
you
here
he
exclaimed
why
marian
norton
you
belong
in
once
i
did
she
smiled
but
now
i
belong
on
the
tundra
with
our
herd
it
is
the
herd
that
has
brought
me
here
may
i
speak
to
you
about
it
certainly
you
may
but
you
look
tired
and
hungry
the
trader
has
a
piping
mulligan
stew
on
the
stove
it
will
do
you
good
come
an
indian
boy
who
made
his
home
with
the
trader
was
dispatched
to
relieve
attatak
of
her
watch
and
marian
sat
down
to
enjoy
a
delicious
repast
there
are
some
disappointments
that
come
to
us
so
gradually
that
though
the
matters
they
effect
are
of
the
utmost
importance
we
are
not
greatly
shocked
when
at
last
their
full
meaning
is
unfolded
to
us
it
was
so
with
marian
she
had
dared
and
endured
much
to
reach
this
spot
she
had
arrived
at
the
critical
moment
an
hour
later
the
agent
would
have
been
gone
the
agent
was
her
friend
ready
to
do
anything
he
could
to
help
her
he
would
gladly
have
gone
back
with
her
to
assist
in
defending
her
rights
but
duty
called
him
over
another
trail
he
had
no
one
absolutely
no
one
to
send
from
this
post
to
execute
his
orders
of
course
he
said
after
hearing
her
story
i
can
give
you
a
note
to
that
outlaw
scarberry
but
he
d
pay
no
attention
to
he
d
tear
it
up
and
throw
it
in
my
face
asserted
marian
stoutly
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
ll
do
said
the
agent
rising
and
walking
the
floor
there
is
ben
neighbor
over
at
the
foot
of
sugar
loaf
mountain
his
cabin
is
only
three
days
travel
from
your
camp
he
s
a
good
man
and
a
brave
one
he
is
a
deputy
marshal
if
i
give
you
a
note
to
him
he
will
serve
you
as
well
as
i
would
we
need
take
a
different
trail
home
why
which
way
did
you
come
marian
described
their
course
the
agent
whistled
it
s
a
wonder
you
didn
t
perish
here
he
said
is
a
rough
map
of
the
country
i
will
mark
out
the
course
to
ben
s
cabin
you
ll
find
it
a
much
safer
oh
all
right
she
said
slowly
thanks
that
s
surely
the
best
she
was
thinking
of
the
treasure
left
at
the
cabin
she
had
hoped
to
return
by
that
route
and
claim
it
now
that
hope
was
gone
chapter
xxii
a
fruitless
journey
it
was
night
such
a
night
as
only
the
arctic
knows
cold
stars
gleaming
like
bits
of
burnished
silver
in
the
sky
shone
down
upon
vast
stretches
of
glistening
snow
out
of
that
whiteness
one
object
loomed
black
as
ink
against
the
whiteness
of
its
background
weary
with
five
days
of
constant
travel
marian
found
herself
approaching
this
black
bulk
she
pushed
doggedly
forward
expecting
at
every
moment
to
catch
a
flash
of
purple
flame
shooting
up
the
side
of
it
the
black
bulk
was
the
old
dredge
in
sinrock
river
she
had
passed
that
way
twice
before
each
time
she
had
hoped
to
find
there
a
haven
of
rest
and
each
time
she
had
been
frightened
away
by
the
flash
of
the
purple
flame
those
mysterious
people
had
left
this
spot
at
one
time
had
they
returned
was
the
dredge
now
a
place
of
danger
or
a
haven
for
weary
travellers
the
answer
to
this
question
was
only
to
be
found
by
marching
boldly
up
to
the
dredge
this
called
for
courage
born
with
a
brave
soul
marian
was
equal
to
any
emergency
sheer
weariness
and
lack
of
sleep
added
to
this
a
touch
of
daring
without
pausing
she
drove
straight
up
to
the
door
reassured
by
the
snow
banked
up
against
it
she
hastily
scooped
away
the
bank
with
her
and
having
shoved
the
door
open
boldly
entered
it
was
a
cheerless
place
black
and
empty
the
wind
whistled
through
the
cracks
where
the
planks
had
rotted
away
yet
it
was
a
shelter
passing
through
another
door
she
found
herself
in
an
inner
room
that
housed
the
boiler
of
the
engine
that
had
furnished
power
to
the
dredge
the
boiler
a
great
red
drum
of
rust
stood
directly
in
front
of
her
here
s
where
we
camp
she
said
to
attatak
we
can
build
a
fire
in
the
of
the
boiler
and
broil
some
steak
that
will
be
splendid
grinned
attatak
and
attatak
bring
the
deer
through
the
outer
door
then
close
it
they
were
fed
two
hours
ago
that
will
do
until
she
lighted
a
candle
gathered
up
some
bits
of
wood
that
lay
strewn
about
the
narrow
room
and
began
to
kindle
a
fire
while
attatak
went
out
after
the
deer
for
the
moment
being
alone
she
began
to
think
of
the
herd
how
was
the
herd
faring
what
had
happened
to
patsy
during
those
many
days
of
her
absence
were
bill
scarberry
s
deer
rapidly
destroying
her
herd
ground
well
if
they
are
we
are
powerless
to
prevent
it
she
told
herself
with
a
sigh
as
she
looked
back
upon
it
now
she
felt
that
her
whole
journey
had
been
a
colossal
failure
they
had
discovered
the
mountain
cave
treasure
only
to
be
obliged
to
leave
the
treasure
behind
they
had
reached
the
station
in
time
to
talk
with
the
government
agent
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
come
with
her
only
hours
before
they
had
reached
the
cabin
of
ben
neighbor
only
to
find
it
dark
and
deserted
he
had
gone
somewhere
as
people
in
the
arctic
have
a
way
of
doing
and
where
that
might
be
she
could
not
even
hazard
a
guess
at
last
in
despair
she
had
headed
her
deer
toward
her
own
camp
in
hours
she
would
be
there
well
at
any
rate
she
sighed
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
see
patsy
and
to
sleep
the
clock
round
in
our
own
sweet
little
deerskin
she
was
indeed
to
see
patsy
but
the
privilege
of
sleeping
the
clock
round
was
not
to
be
hers
for
many
a
day
she
was
destined
to
find
the
immediate
future
far
too
stirring
for
that
hours
later
saw
marian
well
on
her
way
home
ten
hours
more
she
felt
sure
would
bring
her
to
camp
and
then
what
she
could
not
even
guess
had
she
been
able
to
even
so
much
as
suspect
what
was
going
on
at
camp
she
would
have
urged
her
reindeer
to
do
their
utmost
patsy
was
right
in
the
middle
of
a
peck
of
trouble
because
of
the
fact
that
for
the
last
few
days
she
had
been
living
in
a
realm
of
exciting
dreams
the
troubles
that
had
come
down
upon
her
seemed
all
the
more
grievous
since
that
most
welcome
radio
message
regarding
the
proposed
purchase
of
reindeer
by
the
canadian
government
had
come
drifting
in
over
the
air
she
had
during
every
available
moment
hovered
over
the
in
the
momentary
expectation
of
receiving
the
confirmation
of
that
rumor
which
might
send
the
herd
over
mountains
and
tundra
in
a
wild
race
for
a
prize
a
prize
worth
thousands
of
dollars
to
her
uncle
and
sale
of
the
herd
perhaps
it
was
because
of
her
too
close
application
to
the
that
she
failed
to
note
the
approach
of
scarberry
s
herd
as
it
returned
to
ravish
their
feeding
ground
certain
it
was
that
the
first
of
the
deer
with
the
entire
herd
close
upon
their
heels
were
already
over
the
hills
before
she
knew
of
their
coming
it
was
night
when
terogloona
brought
this
bit
of
disquieting
news
and
this
time
patsy
wailed
we
have
not
so
much
as
one
hungry
eskimo
with
his
dog
to
send
against
as
if
in
answer
to
the
complaint
the
aged
herder
plucked
at
her
sleeve
then
led
her
out
beneath
the
open
sky
with
an
impressive
gesture
he
waved
his
arm
toward
the
distant
hills
that
lay
in
the
opposite
direction
of
scarberry
s
herd
to
her
great
surprise
and
mystification
she
saw
gleaming
there
the
lights
of
twenty
or
more
campfires
see
there
he
said
does
it
mean
patsy
stammered
grasping
at
her
dry
throat
it
is
that
i
fear
said
terogloona
they
come
they
are
here
you
gave
food
for
a
week
for
a
few
flour
sugar
bacon
they
like
him
now
come
whole
village
of
want
food
you
gave
them
food
what
you
think
no
food
for
herders
no
herders
no
herders
no
herd
what
you
think
patsy
did
not
know
what
to
think
gone
was
all
her
little
burst
of
pride
over
the
way
she
had
handled
the
other
situation
that
had
confronted
her
now
she
felt
that
she
was
but
a
girl
a
very
small
girl
and
very
very
much
alone
she
wished
marian
would
come
oh
how
she
did
wish
that
she
would
come
in
the
morning
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
was
all
she
could
say
to
the
faithful
old
herder
as
she
turned
to
the
igloo
that
night
she
did
not
undress
she
sat
up
for
hours
trying
to
think
of
some
way
out
she
sat
long
with
the
radio
over
her
ears
she
entertained
some
wild
notion
of
fleeing
with
the
herd
toward
the
canadian
border
providing
the
message
confirming
the
offer
for
the
deer
came
but
the
message
did
not
come
at
last
in
utter
exhaustion
she
threw
herself
among
the
deerskins
and
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
she
was
roused
from
this
sleep
by
a
loud
hello
there
followed
by
a
cheery
where
are
you
are
you
asleep
it
was
marian
the
next
moment
poor
tired
worried
patsy
threw
herself
sobbing
into
her
cousin
s
strong
arms
there
now
said
marian
soothingly
as
patsy
s
sobbing
ceased
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
it
you
re
safe
that
s
something
your
experiences
can
t
have
been
worse
than
the
eskimo
bill
scarberry
s
herd
burst
out
patsy
they
re
here
all
of
them
tell
me
all
about
it
encouraged
marian
wait
till
i
get
my
on
said
patsy
more
hopefully
it
s
been
due
for
days
may
come
at
any
what
s
due
asked
marian
mystified
wait
i
ll
tell
you
one
thing
at
a
time
let
s
get
it
all
she
began
at
the
beginning
and
recited
all
that
had
transpired
since
marian
had
left
camp
when
she
came
to
tell
of
her
discovery
that
one
of
the
mysterious
occupants
of
the
tent
of
the
purple
flame
was
a
girl
marian
s
astonishment
knew
no
bounds
when
told
of
the
bloody
trail
marian
was
up
in
arms
the
camp
of
the
purple
flame
must
be
raided
at
once
they
would
put
a
stop
to
that
sort
of
thing
they
would
take
their
armed
herders
and
raid
that
camp
this
very
night
but
wait
patsy
held
up
a
warning
finger
i
am
not
half
through
yet
there
is
more
too
much
more
she
was
in
the
midst
of
recounting
her
experiences
with
the
band
of
wandering
eskimo
and
scarberry
s
herd
when
suddenly
she
clapped
the
radio
receiver
tightly
to
her
ears
and
stopped
talking
then
she
murmured
it
s
coming
at
last
it
is
coming
for
goodness
sake
exclaimed
marian
out
of
all
patience
will
you
kindly
tell
me
what
is
coming
but
patsy
only
held
the
receiver
to
her
ears
and
listened
the
more
intently
as
she
whispered
shush
wait
chapter
xxiii
planning
the
long
drive
the
message
that
was
holding
patsy
s
attention
was
one
from
the
canadian
government
it
was
a
bonafide
offer
from
that
government
to
purchase
the
first
herd
of
from
four
to
six
hundred
reindeer
that
should
reach
fort
jarvis
when
patsy
had
imparted
the
exciting
news
to
her
marian
sat
long
in
silent
thought
fort
jarvis
as
she
well
knew
lay
some
five
hundred
miles
away
over
hills
and
tundra
she
had
just
returned
from
one
such
wearisome
journey
should
she
start
again
and
would
this
second
great
endeavor
prove
more
successful
than
the
first
of
all
the
herds
in
alaska
two
were
closest
to
fort
jarvis
scarberry
s
and
her
own
she
had
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
scarberry
would
start
driving
a
section
of
his
herd
toward
that
goal
it
would
be
a
race
a
race
that
would
be
won
by
the
bravest
strongest
and
most
skillful
marian
believed
in
her
herders
she
believed
in
herself
and
patsy
she
believed
as
strongly
in
her
herd
her
and
her
dogs
it
was
the
grand
opportunity
the
way
out
of
all
troubles
that
the
band
of
begging
natives
would
not
follow
she
knew
right
well
nor
would
the
mysterious
persons
of
the
purple
flame
camp
at
least
she
hoped
not
as
for
their
little
herd
range
if
they
sold
their
deer
scarberry
might
have
it
and
welcome
if
they
did
not
sell
they
could
doubtless
find
pasture
in
some
far
away
canadian
valley
yes
she
said
in
a
tone
of
decision
we
will
go
we
will
waken
the
herders
at
once
come
on
let
s
as
they
burst
breathlessly
into
the
cabin
of
their
eskimo
herders
they
received
something
of
a
shock
since
all
the
work
of
the
day
had
long
since
been
done
they
had
expected
to
find
the
entire
group
of
four
assembled
in
the
cabin
or
asleep
in
their
bunks
but
here
was
only
old
terogloona
and
attatak
where
s
oatinna
where
s
azazruk
demanded
marian
gone
said
terogloona
solemnly
where
go
call
them
quick
terogloona
did
not
move
he
merely
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
mumbled
no
good
gone
long
way
bill
scarberry
s
camp
no
come
back
say
that
what
exclaimed
marian
in
consternation
gone
deserted
us
terogloona
nodded
his
head
say
bill
scarberry
pay
more
money
more
deer
say
that
one
oatinna
that
one
azazruk
no
good
that
one
bill
scarberry
me
he
shook
his
head
solemnly
not
listen
that
one
oatinna
that
one
azazruk
say
wan
na
go
go
that
s
then
we
can
t
start
the
herd
murmured
marian
sinking
down
upon
a
rolled
up
yes
we
will
she
exclaimed
resolutely
terogloona
where
are
the
rifles
gone
he
repeated
like
a
parrot
mebby
you
forget
that
one
rifle
b
long
herder
and
your
rifle
questioned
marian
where
is
your
rifle
hammer
not
want
come
down
hard
not
want
shoot
that
one
rifle
marian
was
stunned
with
surprise
and
chagrin
she
and
patsy
returned
silently
to
their
igloo
oh
that
treacherous
bill
scarberry
she
exploded
he
has
known
this
was
coming
he
knew
our
herders
were
energetic
and
capable
he
thought
if
they
remained
with
us
we
might
beat
him
to
the
prize
so
he
sent
some
spy
over
here
to
buy
them
away
from
us
with
promises
of
more
and
now
asked
patsy
now

will
drive
his
herd
to
fort
jarvis
and
sell
it
and
our
grand
chance
is
gone
no
exclaimed
patsy
he
won
t
he
shall
not
we
will
beat
him
yet
we
are
strong
terogloona
and
attatak
are
faithful
we
have
our
three
collies

can
do
it
we
will
beat

yet
our

must
do
it
it
s
your
chance

one
big
wonderful
yes
exclaimed
marian
suddenly
fired
by
her
cousin
s
hot
blooded
southern
enthusiasm
we
will
do
it
or
perish
in
the
attempt
it
s
to
be
a
race
she
exclaimed
a
race
for
a
wonderful
prize
a
race
between
two
large
herds
of
reindeer
over
five
hundred
miles
of
hills
tundra
and
forest
there
may
be
wolves
in
the
forests
in
alaska
dangers
lurk
at
every
turn
rivers
too
rapid
to
freeze
over
and
blizzards
and
wild
beasts
we
will
be
terribly
handicapped
from
the
very
start
but
for
father
s
sake
we
must
try
for
your
father
s
and
for
your
own
sake
murmured
patsy
and
marian
i
have
always
believed
that
our
great
creator
was
on
the
side
of
those
who
are
kind
and
just
bill
scarberry
played
us
a
mean
trick
perhaps
god
will
somehow
even
the
an
hour
was
spent
in
consultation
with
old
terogloona
his
face
became
very
sober
at
the
situation
but
in
the
end
with
the
blood
of
youth
coursing
eternally
in
his
veins
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
exclaimed
we
will
go
before
it
is
day
we
will
be
away
you
go
sleep
you
must
be
very
strong
in
the
morning
terogloona
will
have
reindeer
and
sleds
ready
we
will
call
to
the
dogs
we
will
be
away
before
the
sun
we
will
shout
hurry
hurry
to
dogs
and
reindeer
we
will
beat
that
one
bill
yet
you

exclaimed
his
face
darkening
like
a
thundercloud

work

mebby
beat
that
one
bill
there
came
a
look
of
determination
to
patsy
s
face
such
as
marian
had
never
seen
there
if
that
s
the
kind
of
man
he
is
if
he
would
send
an
eskimo
boy
by
his
own
worthless
rifle
out
into
the
snow
and
the
cold
then
we
must
beat
him
we
must
we
must
said
patsy
vehemently
that
s
exactly
the
kind
of
man
he
is
said
marian
soberly
we
must
beat
him
if
we
can
but
it
will
be
a
long
hard
they
had
hardly
crept
between
their
deerskins
when
patsy
was
fast
asleep
not
so
marian
the
full
responsibility
of
this
perilous
journey
rested
upon
her
shoulders
she
knew
too
well
the
hardships
and
dangers
they
must
face
they
must
pass
through
broad
stretches
of
forest
where
food
for
the
deer
was
scarce
and
where
lurking
wolves
worn
down
to
mere
skeletons
by
the
scarcity
of
food
might
attack
and
scatter
their
herd
beyond
recovery
they
must
cross
high
hills
from
whose
summits
the
snow
at
times
poured
like
smoke
from
volcanoes
in
circling
sweeps
hundreds
of
feet
in
extent
here
there
would
be
danger
of
losing
their
deer
in
some
wild
blizzard
or
having
them
buried
beneath
the
snows
of
some
thundering
avalanche
it
s
not
for
myself
alone
that
i
m
afraid
she
told
herself
it
s
for
patsy
patsy
from
kentucky
who
would
have
thought
a
girl
from
the
sunny
south
could
be
so
brave
such
a
good
as
she
thought
of
the
courageous
carefree
manner
in
which
patsy
had
insisted
on
the
journey
a
lump
rose
in
her
throat
and
she
brushed
a
hand
hastily
over
her
eyes
and
yet
she
asked
herself
ought
i
to
allow
her
to
do
it
she
s
younger
than
i
and
not
so
strong
can
she
stand
the
strain
again
her
mind
took
up
the
thought
of
the
perils
they
must
face
there
were
wandering
tribes
of
indians
in
the
territory
they
must
cross
the
skulking
and
treacherous
indians
of
the
little
sticks
what
if
they
were
to
cross
the
path
of
these
what
if
a
great
band
of
caribou
should
come
pouring
down
some
mountain
pass
and
having
swallowed
up
their
little
herd
go
sweeping
on
leaving
them
in
the
midst
of
a
great
wilderness
with
only
their
to
stand
between
them
and
starvation
as
if
dreaming
of
marian
s
thoughts
patsy
suddenly
turned
over
with
a
little
sobbing
cry
and
wound
her
arms
about
marian
what
is
it
marian
whispered
patsy
did
not
answer
she
was
still
asleep
the
dream
soon
passed
her
muscles
relaxed
and
with
a
deep
sigh
she
sank
back
into
her
place
this
little
drama
left
marian
in
an
exceedingly
troubled
state
of
mind
we
ought
not
to
go
she
told
herself
we
will
then
from
sheer
exhaustion
she
too
fell
asleep
three
hours
before
the
tardy
arctic
sunrise
she
heard
terogloona
pounding
at
their
door
she
found
that
sleep
had
banished
fear
and
that
every
muscle
in
her
body
and
every
cell
of
her
brain
was
ready
for
action
eager
to
be
away
as
for
patsy
she
could
not
dress
half
fast
enough
so
great
was
her
desire
for
the
wonderful
adventure
chapter
xxiv
camp
followers
it
was
just
as
marian
was
tightening
the
ropes
to
the
pack
on
her
sled
that
happening
to
glance
away
at
a
distant
hill
she
was
reminded
of
patsy
s
latest
story
of
the
purple
flame
from
the
crest
of
that
hill
there
came
a
purple
flare
of
light
quickly
as
it
had
come
just
so
quickly
it
vanished
leaving
the
hill
a
faint
outline
against
the
sky
the
purple
flame
she
breathed
i
wonder
if
we
can
leave
those
mysterious
of
ours
behind
on
the
instant
a
disturbing
thought
flashed
through
her
mind
it
caused
an
indignant
flash
of
color
to
rise
to
her
cheek
i
wonder
she
said
slowly
if
those
mysterious
people
are
spies
set
by
bill
scarberry
to
dog
our
tracks
they
may
start
with
us
she
smiled
to
herself
as
she
at
last
dismissed
the
subject
from
her
mind
but
unless
they
really
are
bill
scarberry
s
spies
and
set
to
watch
us
they
ll
never
finish
with
us
don
t
follow
over
five
hundred
miles
of
wild
trail
they
re
not
that
fond
of
hard
in
this
conclusion
she
was
partly
wrong
just
as
the
sun
was
painting
the
distant
mountain
peaks
with
a
gleam
of
gold
the
collies
began
to
bark
and
the
broad
herd
of
reindeer
moved
slowly
forward
marian
and
patsy
touched
their
deer
gently
with
the
reins
and
they
were
away
it
was
with
a
distinct
feeling
of
homesickness
that
marian
turned
to
look
back
at
the
campsite
she
had
spent
many
happy
hours
there
now
she
was
leaving
it
perhaps
forever
what
was
more
she
was
leaving
the
tundra
the
deer
pastures
of
the
arctics
should
their
enterprise
succeed
she
would
pass
over
one
of
the
canadian
trails
southward
to
the
states
and
back
to
the
university
should
they
fail
she
might
indeed
return
to
the
tundra
but
she
knew
it
could
never
be
the
same
to
her
we
must
not
fail
she
told
herself
clenching
her
hands
tight
and
staring
away
at
the
magnificent
panorama
which
lay
before
her
we
must
not
must
not
fail
as
she
saw
the
reindeer
a
mass
of
brown
and
white
moving
down
the
slope
a
feeling
of
sadness
swept
over
her
she
had
come
to
love
these
gentle
and
creatures
of
the
north
she
was
especially
fond
of
the
her
three
the
spotted
one
the
brown
one
and
the
white
many
hundred
miles
had
she
driven
them
nowhere
in
the
world
she
was
sure
could
there
be
deer
who
covered
more
miles
in
a
day
who
were
quicker
to
recognize
the
pull
of
rein
more
willing
to
stomp
the
tiresome
nights
away
at
the
ends
of
their
tethers
dearest
of
all
were
the
three
collie
dogs
gold
copper
and
bronze
she
whimsically
named
them
for
their
coats
were
just
what
their
names
indicated
copper
and
bronze
were
young
dogs
gold
was
the
pick
of
the
three
an
old
sheep
dog
accustomed
to
the
sunny
pastures
of
california
he
had
been
brought
to
this
cold
and
barren
land
to
herd
reindeer
with
the
sturdy
devotion
of
his
kind
he
had
endured
the
biting
cold
without
a
whimper
and
had
gnawed
his
toes
cut
by
the
crusted
snow
in
silence
he
had
done
the
work
assigned
to
him
with
a
zeal
and
thoroughness
that
might
have
shamed
many
a
human
master
these
too
i
must
leave
she
told
herself
worse
than
that
i
am
leading
them
out
into
wild
desert
within
a
week
that
beautiful
herd
may
be
hopelessly
scattered
our
killed
by
wolves
our
anyway
they
will
never
desert
us
together
we
will
fight
it
out
to
the
bitter
a
lump
came
into
her
throat
then
realizing
that
she
was
the
commander
of
this
expedition
and
that
it
was
unbecoming
of
commanders
to
betray
emotion
she
quickly
conquered
her
feelings
and
gave
herself
over
to
the
work
of
assisting
in
keeping
the
herd
moving
steadily
forward
in
a
compact
mass
five
days
later
with
their
herd
still
moving
steadily
on
before
them
and
with
hopes
rising
high
because
of
the
continued
success
of
their
march
they
found
themselves
crossing
a
succession
of
hills
as
they
reached
the
crest
of
the
highest
of
these
and
arrived
at
a
place
where
they
could
get
an
unrestricted
view
of
the
tundra
that
lay
beyond
an
exclamation
escaped
marian
s
lips
a
forest
she
exclaimed
a
real
arctic
forest
echoed
patsy
won
t
it
be
wonderful
wonderful
and
dangerous
marian
replied
unless
i
miss
my
guess
here
is
where
our
troubles
begin
it
may
not
be
so
bad
though
she
quickly
amended
as
she
saw
the
look
of
fear
that
came
over
her
cousin
s
face
that
forest
is
fully
ten
miles
away
the
sun
is
about
to
set
we
ll
drive
our
herd
down
into
the
tundra
where
there
is
plenty
of
moss
we
ll
camp
there
and
get
up
for
an
early
start
in
the
morning
the
forest
may
be
only
a
narrow
belt
along
a
marian
did
not
feel
very
sure
that
her
predictions
would
prove
true
but
she
was
the
sort
of
person
who
measures
all
perils
carefully
then
hopes
for
the
best
two
hours
later
they
were
eating
a
meal
of
reindeer
stew
and
hot
biscuits
which
had
been
cooked
over
a
fire
in
their
yukon
stove
then
as
they
chatted
of
the
future
marian
held
up
a
finger
for
silence
what
was
that
she
whispered
a
shot
i
didn
yes
yes
there
s
another
marian
was
up
and
out
of
the
tent
in
an
instant
as
her
eyes
swept
the
horizon
they
caught
a
gleam
of
light
from
the
hills
above
the
red
and
yellow
light
of
a
with
one
sweeping
glance
she
took
in
the
position
of
her
herd
she
had
just
noted
that
a
certain
brown
deer
had
strayed
some
distance
up
the
hill
she
was
about
to
suggest
to
terogloona
who
had
also
been
called
from
his
tent
by
the
shots
that
he
send
a
dog
after
the
deer
when
to
her
great
astonishment
she
caught
a
flash
of
light
heard
a
sharp
report
then
saw
the
brown
deer
crumple
up
like
an
empty
sack
and
drop
to
the
snow
for
one
instant
she
stood
there
as
if
in
a
trance
then
with
a
quick
turn
she
said
patsy
you
stay
with
attatak
terogloona
you
come
with
turning
she
walked
straight
toward
the
spot
where
the
reindeer
had
fallen
the
faithful
terogloona
in
spite
of
his
fear
of
the
indians
of
the
little
sticks
followed
at
her
heels
when
they
arrived
at
the
spot
they
found
a
man
bending
over
the
dead
deer
in
his
hand
was
the
rifle
that
had
sped
the
bullet
the
that
marian
and
terogloona
wore
made
no
sound
on
the
snow
the
man
s
back
was
toward
them
and
they
came
upon
him
unobserved
the
powerful
terogloona
would
have
leaped
upon
his
back
and
thrown
him
to
the
snow
but
marian
held
him
back
stranger
said
the
girl
in
as
steady
a
voice
as
she
could
why
did
you
kill
our
deer
like
a
flash
the
man
gripped
his
rifle
as
he
wheeled
about
then
seeing
it
was
a
girl
who
spoke
he
lowered
his
weapon
marian
s
eyes
took
him
in
with
one
feeling
glance
his
face
was
haggard
emaciated
his
hands
were
mere
skin
and
bones
he
was
an
indian
too
hungry
he
murmured
no
come
caribou
no
come
ptarmigan
no
fish
in
the
river
no
rabbits
on
the
tundra
he
spread
out
his
bony
hands
in
a
gesture
of
despair
but
you
needn
t
have
killed
him
had
you
come
to
us
we
would
have
given
you
meat
all
you
could
the
girl
s
face
was
frank
and
fearless
yet
there
was
a
certain
huskiness
in
her
voice
that
to
the
sensitive
ears
of
the
indian
betokened
kindness
yes
he
said
slowly
maybe
you
would
yesterday
we
saw
other
reindeer
herd
north
mebby
ten
miles
want

ask
man
big
man

said

that
one
we
go
way
then
see
your
herd
say
take
one
deer
you
want
to
fight
then
fight
better
to
die
by
bullet
than
by
the
man
you
saw
said
marian
her
heart
sinking
as
she
realized
that
he
must
be
a
half
day
in
the
lead
was
bill
scarberry
yes
he
is
a
mean
man
but
see
have
you
a
cache
some
place
where
you
can
keep
meat
from
the
wolves
and
wolverines
yes

exclaimed
the
indian
eagerly
ten
miles
diesa
river
a
how
many
deer
must
you
have
to
keep
you
until
game
comes
the
indian
stared
at
her
in
astonishment
mebby
two
mebby
all
right
said
marian
you
have
killed
a
fine
doe
that
was
bad
but
i
forgive
she
held
our
her
hand
to
grasp
the
native
s
bony
fingers
now
she
said
briskly
since
you
have
killed
her
you
may
keep
the
meat
terogloona
she
turned
to
the
eskimo
point
out
two
young
bucks
the
best
we
have
tell
him
he
may
kill
them
and
that
he
and
his
friends
may
take
them
to
their
the
indian
attempted
to
speak
failing
utterly
he
turned
and
walked
a
few
steps
away
then
turning
struck
straight
away
toward
the
spot
where
the
red
and
yellow
campfire
gleamed
that
is
his
camp
asked
marian
terogloona
nodded
silently
they
will
come
for
the
meat
and
will
give
us
no
further
trouble
smiled
the
eskimo
the
daughter
of
my
master
has
acted
wisely
the
man
who
starves
he
is
different
these
reindeer
he
waved
his
arms
toward
the
herd
they
belong
to
my
master
and
his
daughter
when
men
are
not
when
men
are
to
the
starving
all
things
belong
bill
scarberry
he
remember
yet
indians
of
little
sticks
they
never
as
marian
turned
to
retrace
her
steps
to
camp
she
chanced
to
glance
up
at
the
other
camp
where
but
an
hour
before
she
had
seen
the
flash
of
the
purple
flame
it
was
closer
than
she
thought
the
flash
of
flame
was
gone
but
she
was
sure
she
caught
the
outlines
of
a
tent
surer
still
that
she
saw
a
solitary
figure
atop
a
nearby
knoll
sitting
as
if
on
watch
this
solitary
man
held
a
rifle
across
his
knees
i
wonder
why
he
is
there
she
said
to
herself
i
wonder
why
they
are
following
us
oh
she
breathed
as
she
walked
toward
camp
it
s
so
tantalizing
that
purple
flame
and
all
i
have
half
a
notion
to
take
terogloona
as
i
did
with
that
indian
and
march
right
up
to
them
and
demand
the
meaning
of
their
mysterious
actions
as
if
intending
to
turn
this
thought
into
action
at
once
she
stopped
and
turned
about
to
her
surprise
as
she
looked
toward
the
crest
of
the
hill
she
saw
the
solitary
watcher
was
gone
oh
well
she
sighed
we
have
no
real
reason
for
invading
their
camp
we
ve
no
proof
that
they
ve
ever
done
us
any
harm
except
perhaps
the
time
that
patsy
saw
the
and
the
antler
marks
in
the
snow
it
seems
that
it
must
have
been
our
deer
but
we
never
could
prove
glancing
away
at
a
more
distant
she
was
surprised
at
the
picture
revealed
there
the
moon
just
rising
from
behind
the
hill
threw
out
in
bold
relief
the
antlers
of
a
magnificent
creature
of
the
wilderness
old
said
marian
what
do
you
think
of
that
we
have
traveled
five
days
and
yet
we
are
still
in
the
company
of
the
mysterious
of
the
purple
flame
and
old
the
who
has
haunted
the
outskirts
of
our
camp
so
long
i
suppose
she
said
thoughtfully
that
i
should
tell
terogloona
to
have
the
indians
kill
that
would
save
one
of
our
reindeers
and
besides
if
we
let
him
live
who
knows
but
that
at
some
critical
moment
he
may
rush
in
and
assume
the
leadership
of
our
herd
and
lead
them
to
disaster
or
lose
them
to
us
forever
i
have
heard
of
that
happening
with
horses
and
cattle
why
not
with
reindeer
and
yet
she
sighed
i
can
t
quite
make
up
my
mind
to
do
it
he
is
such
a
wonderful
fellow
the
time
was
to
come
and
that
very
soon
when
she
was
to
rejoice
because
of
this
decision
chapter
xxv
the
mirage
that
night
marian
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
she
had
a
vague
feeling
that
they
were
approaching
a
crisis
many
agencies
were
at
work
some
appeared
to
favor
the
success
of
their
enterprise
and
some
were
working
directly
against
them
scarberry
with
his
herd
was
some
hours
ahead
of
them
that
was
bad
if
he
succeeded
in
retaining
this
lead
the
race
was
lost
however
less
than
half
the
distance
had
been
covered
the
easiest
half
many
a
peril
awaited
each
herd
who
could
tell
when
prowling
wolves
large
bands
of
indians
a
caribou
herd
an
impassable
river
might
bring
either
to
a
halt
marian
could
not
answer
all
of
the
questions
that
troubled
her
the
indians
would
they
be
satisfied
with
her
gift
of
food
or
would
they
continue
to
prey
upon
the
herd
would
they
go
back
to
some
large
tribe
and
lead
them
to
the
herd
that
they
might
drive
them
away
an
easy
bounty
she
had
dealt
with
eskimos
knew
about
what
to
expect
from
them
but
indians
she
whispered
to
herself
what
are
they
like
as
if
in
answer
to
her
perplexity
there
came
to
her
mind
the
words
of
a
great
and
good
man
humanity
is
everywhere
very
much
the
this
thought
gave
her
comfort
she
could
not
help
but
feel
that
the
indian
she
had
befriended
would
not
betray
her
but
might
even
come
to
her
aid
in
some
emergency
but
those
of
the
purple
flame
she
whispered
to
herself
that
silent
watcher
on
the
did
he
mean
by
sitting
there
with
a
rifle
across
his
knee
is
he
and
his
companions
our
friends
or
our
enemies
here
indeed
was
a
problem
until
this
day
she
had
felt
that
these
persons
were
to
be
distrusted
and
feared
however
there
had
been
something
about
that
silent
watcher
that
had
given
her
a
feeling
of
safety
in
spite
of
her
prejudice
it
was
as
if
he
were
set
there
as
a
watch
to
see
that
the
indian
did
us
no
harm
she
told
herself
and
yet
how
could
he
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
perplexity
that
she
fell
asleep
long
before
dawn
the
girls
awoke
to
face
a
new
day
and
a
new
unknown
peril
the
forest
stretching
out
black
and
somber
against
the
white
foreground
of
snow
seemed
a
great
menacing
hand
reaching
out
to
seize
their
precious
possession
they
could
not
know
what
perils
awaited
them
in
the
forest
with
breakfast
over
the
tents
struck
harnessed
and
hitched
to
the
sled
and
everything
in
readiness
for
the
continuing
of
the
race
to
fort
jarvis
the
girls
climbed
the
nearest
hill
hoping
that
they
might
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
country
beyond
the
forest
their
hopes
were
vain
far
as
eye
could
see
the
forest
stretched
before
them
they
could
only
guess
the
miles
they
must
travel
before
coming
again
to
rolling
hills
and
level
tundra
they
were
traveling
over
a
region
of
the
great
northland
which
had
never
really
been
explored
no
accurate
maps
showed
where
rivers
ran
or
forests
spread
out
over
the
plains
standing
there
looking
at
the
great
forest
patsy
quoted
this
the
forest
primeval
the
murmuring
pines
and
the
hemlocks
stand
like
druids
of
old
with
beards
that
rest
on
their
and
with
two
eskimos
for
companions
we
are
to
enter
that
forest
only
wild
people
and
wilder
caribou
and
wolves
have
been
there
before
us
oh
marian
we
are
explorers
we
really
truly
are
isn
t
it
marian
did
not
answer
there
was
a
puzzled
look
on
her
face
as
she
stared
away
toward
the
north
out
of
the
very
clouds
faint
images
appeared
to
be
marching
yes
yes
now
they
became
clearer
whole
herd
of
them
what
could
it
mean
was
this
a
vision
was
she
seeing
things
or
was
it
possible
that
much
higher
hills
lay
over
there
and
that
the
reindeer
were
crossing
them
look
she
said
to
her
cousin
pointing
away
to
the
clouds
together
with
bated
breaths
they
watched
the
panorama
that
moved
before
them
now
they
saw
the
herders
and
their
dogs
saw
them
run
this
way
and
that
saw
the
herd
change
its
course
saw
the
herders
again
take
up
the
steady
march
why
exclaimed
patsy
seems
as
if
you
could
hear
the
of
reindeer
hoofs
and
the
bark
of
the
dogs
they
must
be
miles
away
it
s
the
scarberry
herd
said
marian
look
whispered
patsy
the
deer
are
it
was
true
having
come
to
an
abrupt
halt
as
if
facing
an
insurmountable
barrier
the
leaders
compelled
those
that
followed
to
pack
in
a
solid
mass
behind
them
or
to
spread
out
to
right
or
left
in
an
incredibly
short
time
they
stood
out
in
a
straight
line
facing
east
must
be
a
river
a
river
that
is
still
open
that
can
not
be
crossed
said
marian
in
tones
of
tense
excitement
and
that
means
exclaimed
patsy
that
our
rival
has
been
stopped
nature
has
brought
them
to
a
halt
we
may
win
yet
let
s
hurry
we
may
find
a
in
the
but
look
look
over
there
to
the
left
cried
patsy
what
where
why
they
re
gone
exclaimed
patsy
there
were
three
men
indians
they
looked
like
they
seemed
to
be
watching
the
scarberry
herd
from
a
hilltop
some
distance
but
look
cried
marian
it
s
gone
to
their
great
astonishment
the
herd
had
vanished
as
it
had
appeared
to
march
out
of
the
clouds
so
it
seemed
now
to
have
receded
again
into
them
were
we
dreaming
patsy
asked
in
an
awed
whisper
no
said
marian
thoughtfully
it
was
a
mirage
a
mirage
of
the
great
white
wilderness
we
have
them
here
just
as
they
do
on
the
desert
by
the
aid
of
this
mirage
nature
has
shown
us
a
great
secret
that
we
still
have
a
splendid
chance
to
win
the
race
let
s
get
down
to
camp
and
be
but
the
three
indians
questioned
patsy
what
were
they
about
to
do
who
knows
said
marian
we
have
little
to
do
with
the
scarberry
herd
our
task
is
that
of
getting
to
fort
two
hours
were
consumed
in
reaching
the
edge
of
the
forest
after
that
for
hours
they
passed
through
the
wonder
world
of
a
northern
forest
in
winter
deep
and
still
the
snow
lay
like
a
great
white
blanket
black
as
ebonite
against
this
whiteness
stood
the
fir
and
spruce
trees
there
was
something
strangely
solemn
about
the
place
the
crack
of
reindeer
s
hoofs
the
bark
of
dogs
all
seemed
strangely
out
of
place
here
it
was
as
though
they
stood
on
holy
ground
it
s
like
a
church
patsy
said
in
an
awed
voice
god
s
great
cathedral
answered
marian
fortunately
the
trees
were
not
too
close
together
there
was
room
for
the
deer
to
pass
between
them
so
as
before
the
herd
moved
forward
in
a
fairly
compact
mass
going
to
be
easy
was
patsy
s
comment
after
three
hours
had
passed
i
don
t
know
marian
shook
her
head
in
doubt
i
hope
so
but
you
know
an
alaskan
who
is
used
to
barren
hills
and
tundra
dreads
a
forest
i
belong
to
the
tundra
so
i
dread
it
in
spite
of
her
fears
just
at
nightfall
marian
found
herself
passing
from
beneath
the
last
spruce
tree
and
gazing
away
at
rolling
hills
beyond
she
was
just
offering
up
a
little
prayer
of
thanksgiving
when
some
movement
of
the
forward
herd
leaders
attracted
her
attention
they
re
stopping
she
said
i
wonder
why
instantly
the
vision
of
the
morning
flashed
through
her
mind
the
river
she
exclaimed
in
alarm
we
can
t
cross
it
we
ll
have
to
camp
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
that
is
bad
very
bad
animals
that
are
cowards
and
slink
away
by
day
become
daring
beasts
of
prey
at
a
hurried
race
forward
confirmed
her
worst
suspicions
there
at
her
feet
was
a
river
flanked
on
one
side
by
willows
and
on
the
other
by
a
steep
bank
it
was
not
a
broad
could
throw
a
stone
across
it
did
flow
swiftly
its
powerful
current
had
thus
far
defied
the
winter
s
fiercest
blasts
it
was
full
to
the
brim
with
milky
water
and
crowding
cakes
of
ice
no
creature
could
brave
that
torrent
and
live
blocked
she
cried
and
just
when
i
was
hoping
for
so
much
sinking
down
upon
the
snow
she
gave
herself
over
for
a
moment
to
hopeless
despair
the
next
moment
she
was
on
her
feet
with
arms
outstretched
toward
the
stars
as
if
in
appeal
for
aid
she
spoke
through
tight
clenched
teeth
we
must
we
will
we
will
win
as
if
in
mockery
of
her
high
resolves
at
that
moment
there
came
to
her
ears
the
howl
of
a
timber
wolf
the
call
of
the
wolf
was
answered
by
another
and
yet
another
at
the
moment
they
seemed
some
distance
away
but
marian
trembled
at
the
sound
a
wolf
travels
fast
she
told
herself
as
she
turned
to
hurry
back
to
patsy
and
her
faithful
eskimo
listen
she
exclaimed
as
she
came
near
to
her
companions
sounds
like
ten
or
twelve
of
them
howling
at
once
terogloona
do
wolves
travel
in
packs
mebby
not
the
eskimo
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
often
they
are
many
then
they
call
to
one
another
they
come
all
to
one
place
then
there
s
trouble
there
will
be
trouble
and
we
have
no
rifle
he
broke
off
abruptly
to
lean
forward
in
a
listening
attitude
that
is
strange
he
murmured
they
have
found
some
prey
back
there
where
they
are
perhaps
a
as
they
stood
at
strained
attention
it
became
evident
to
all
that
the
creature
being
pursued
was
coming
down
the
wind
toward
them
the
of
the
wolves
now
in
full
pursuit
grew
momentarily
louder
at
the
beginning
they
had
seemed
two
miles
away
now
they
seemed
but
one
mile
a
half
mile
the
girls
fairly
held
their
breaths
as
they
watched
and
waited
and
now
it
seemed
that
the
wolves
must
be
all
but
upon
them
then
with
a
sudden
cry
marian
saw
the
great
spreading
antlers
of
old
the
king
of
reindeer
and
caribou
rise
above
the
ridge
he
s
not
alone
there
are
others
patsy
breathed
reindeer
marian
murmured
in
astonishment
it
was
true
one
by
one
at
first
then
by
fives
and
tens
a
drove
of
deer
fifty
or
sixty
in
number
appeared
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
came
plunging
down
toward
marian
s
herd
the
old
monarch
had
never
before
joined
their
herd
but
this
time
without
a
second
s
hesitation
he
plunged
straight
on
until
he
came
to
the
edge
of
the
herd
then
with
a
peculiar
whistled
challenge
he
wheeled
about
and
with
antlers
lowered
for
battle
pawed
defiance
at
the
band
of
wolves
then
a
strange
and
interesting
drama
began
to
be
enacted
there
was
a
shifting
and
turning
of
deer
front
ranks
were
quickly
formed
when
the
wolves
with
lolling
tongues
and
dripping
jaws
reached
the
spot
they
found
themselves
facing
a
solid
row
of
antlers
quick
as
they
were
to
understand
the
situation
and
to
rush
away
in
a
circle
to
execute
a
rear
attack
the
deer
under
the
monarch
s
leadership
were
quicker
other
lines
were
formed
until
a
complete
circle
of
antlers
confronted
the
beasts
of
prey
the
weaker
and
younger
deer
were
in
the
center
then
it
was
that
the
girls
discovered
for
the
first
time
that
they
too
were
in
the
center
that
they
were
surrounded
by
the
restless
snorting
pawing
herd
of
deer
in
their
interest
at
watching
the
progress
of
events
they
had
not
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
deer
in
swinging
about
had
encircled
them
that
they
were
in
peril
they
knew
all
too
well
they
read
this
in
the
look
of
concern
on
terogloona
s
face
circle
hold
all
right
he
said
soberly
not
hold

wolf
there
was
apparently
nothing
to
do
but
wait
to
the
wolf
pack
new
numbers
appeared
to
be
added
from
time
to
time
the
sound
of
their
came
incessantly
the
circle
swayed
now
to
this
side
and
now
to
that
as
some
frightened
deer
appeared
ready
to
break
away
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
the
girls
prevented
themselves
from
being
knocked
down
and
trampled
under
the
sharp
hoofs
of
the
surging
deer
what
will
it
be
like
if
the
circle
breaks
and
they
really
stampede
groaned
patsy
for
the
first
time
in
her
arctic
experience
she
was
truly
frightened
i
don
t
know
answered
marian
we
can
only
trust
i
wish
we
were
out
of
this
i
a
sharp
exclamation
escaped
marian
s
lips
over
to
the
left
a
deer
had
gone
down
the
wolves
appeared
to
have
cut
the
tendons
to
his
forelegs
there
was
terrible
confusion
it
seemed
that
the
day
was
lost
that
the
stampede
was
at
hand
keep
close
to
me
marian
whispered
bravely
some
way
we
will
pull
patsy
gripped
her
arm
for
the
final
struggle
then
to
her
astonishment
she
heard
the
sound
of
a
shot
then
another
and
yet
another
someone
to
our
rescue
cried
marian
who
can
it
be
chapter
xxvi
the
mysterious
deliverer
accustomed
as
they
were
to
the
presence
of
men
the
reindeer
not
at
all
frightened
by
the
shots
held
their
position
in
the
impregnable
circle
the
cowardly
wolves
began
to
slink
away
at
the
first
shot
it
seemed
no
time
at
all
until
the
only
sound
to
be
heard
was
the
rattle
of
antlers
as
the
deer
broke
ranks
and
began
to
scatter
again
for
feeding
some
moments
before
the
girls
could
make
their
way
out
of
the
center
of
the
herd
the
firing
ceased
who
could
it
have
been
patsy
asked
don
t
know
said
marian
whoever
it
was
we
must
find
them
and
thank
this
task
she
found
to
be
more
difficult
than
she
had
supposed
there
had
doubtless
been
tracks
left
by
the
strange
deliverer
but
these
had
already
been
trampled
by
the
deer
search
as
they
might
they
could
find
no
trace
of
the
person
who
had
fired
the
shots
mute
testimony
of
his
skill
as
a
marksman
two
dead
wolves
lay
on
the
snow
close
to
the
spot
where
the
defensive
circle
had
been
formed
what
did
you
make
of
that
marian
asked
at
last
in
great
bewilderment
terogloona
where
could
they
have
gone
i
don
t
know
terogloona
shook
his
head
soberly
one
of
marian
s
sleds
had
been
left
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
upon
returning
to
this
they
experienced
another
great
surprise
lying
across
the
sled
was
a
rifle
and
in
a
pile
beside
it
were
five
boxes
of
cartridges
a
rifle
exclaimed
marian
seizing
it
and
drawing
it
from
his
leather
sheath
a
beauty
and
a
new
one
the
two
girls
sat
down
on
the
sled
and
stared
at
one
another
in
speechless
silence
terogloona
and
attatak
soon
joined
them
it
was
the
indian
the
one
we
saved
from
starving
exclaimed
patsy
at
last
i
just
know
it
terogloona
shook
his
head
old
rifle
mebby
all
right
he
mumbled
new
rifle
mebby
indian
not
the
girls
not
at
all
convinced
that
this
conclusion
was
a
correct
one
still
clung
to
the
belief
that
their
protector
had
been
the
indian
since
it
was
impossible
to
cross
the
river
it
was
decided
that
they
should
make
camp
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
that
terogloona
with
the
rifle
was
to
keep
watch
over
the
herd
the
first
part
of
the
night
and
marian
who
was
a
good
shot
the
latter
half
it
was
while
marian
was
packing
away
the
dishes
after
supper
that
the
piece
of
old
ivory
with
the
ancient
engraving
on
it
the
newest
piece
which
they
had
found
in
the
mountain
cave
fell
out
of
her
sleeping
bag
without
knowing
it
she
had
saved
this
the
least
of
their
treasures
look
she
said
to
terogloona
who
sat
before
the
fire
we
found
this
in
a
mountain
cave
what
does
it
say
surely
you
can
read
for
a
long
time
terogloona
studied
the
crude
picture
in
silence
when
at
last
he
spoke
it
was
to
inform
her
that
the
ivory
had
once
belonged
to
his
that
it
told
of
a
very
successful
hunt
in
which
twenty
caribou
had
been
driven
into
a
trap
and
killed
with
bows
and
arrows
that
shortly
after
that
they
had
come
upon
a
white
man
with
a
long
beard
starving
in
a
cabin
beside
a
stream
they
had
given
the
man
caribou
meat
he
had
grown
strong
then
had
gone
away
as
pay
for
their
kindness
he
had
offered
them
heavy
yellow
pebbles
and
dust
from
a
moosehide
sack
this
they
had
not
taken
because
they
did
not
know
what
it
was
good
for
they
had
asked
two
cups
and
a
knife
instead
as
he
explained
this
the
eskimo
showed
each
picture
that
told
the
part
of
the
story
narrated
it
seems
very
real
said
marian
how
long
ago
could
it
have
been
mebby
twenty
years
said
terogloona
the
white
man
was
a
and
the
yellow
pebbles
and
dust
must
have
been
gold
exclaimed
patsy
oh
marian
if
we
could
find
that
place
we
d
be
rich
terogloona
could
you
find
the
place
again
the
eskimo
studied
the
ancient
he
said
at
last
mebby
oh
marian
we
ll
go
back
said
patsy
doing
a
wild
dance
on
her
sleeping
bag
we
ll
go
back
for
gold
for
the
present
said
marian
quietly
we
have
work
enough
we
must
get
our
herd
to
fort
jarvis
looks
as
if
that
will
be
a
difficult
enough
but
tell
me
she
turned
suddenly
to
terogloona
there
were
more
than
fifty
reindeer
with
old
were
there
not
where
did
they
come
from
my
master
s
they
are
the
deer
we
have
been
missing
all
winter
the
ones
we
thought
had
been
killed
why
she
leaped
suddenly
to
her
feet
in
her
excitement
then
those
people
can
not
have
killed
our
deer
at
all
no
not
then
why
did
they
follow
us
are
they
following
us
now
what
was
it
they
killed
that
night
if
not
our
deer
oh
it
s
too
perplexing
for
terogloona
looked
at
her
and
smiled
a
droll
smile
many
strange
things
on
hill
and
tundra
some
time
mebby
know
mebby
not
terogloona
must
go
watch
you
sleep
mebby
very
taking
up
the
rifle
he
left
the
tent
before
creeping
into
her
sleeping
bag
marian
stepped
out
of
the
tent
to
cool
her
heated
brow
in
the
crisp
night
air
above
her
the
stars
gleamed
like
tiny
beyond
her
the
dark
forest
loomed
from
the
distance
she
caught
the
bump
and
grind
of
ice
crowding
the
banks
of
the
river
morning
came
and
with
it
the
problem
of
crossing
the
river
they
had
been
traveling
by
compass
as
far
as
marian
could
tell
to
go
either
up
or
down
the
river
would
be
to
go
out
of
their
direct
path
terogloona
advised
going
north
some
signs
unintelligible
to
the
girls
but
clear
enough
to
him
appeared
to
promise
a
crossing
two
or
three
miles
above
for
once
the
canny
instincts
of
the
eskimo
failed
he
was
no
longer
in
his
own
land
of
barren
hills
tundra
and
sea
perhaps
this
caused
him
to
err
one
thing
was
certain
as
they
traveled
northward
the
hills
that
lined
the
stream
grew
more
rugged
and
rocky
and
the
river
more
turbulent
we
won
t
find
a
crossing
for
miles
marian
said
with
a
tone
of
conviction
even
terogloona
paused
to
ponder
and
scratch
his
head
it
was
just
at
the
moment
when
despair
appeared
about
to
take
possession
of
them
that
patsy
chancing
to
glance
away
at
the
hills
that
loomed
above
the
opposite
banks
suddenly
cried
look
a
man
all
looked
in
the
direction
she
had
pointed
the
man
was
standing
perfectly
still
but
his
right
hand
was
pointing
like
a
wooden
signboard
it
pointed
downstream
three
times
the
arm
dropped
three
times
it
was
raised
to
point
again
he
is
an
indian
said
terogloona
stoically
it
is
his
country
he
knows
we
must
go
back
the
crossing
lies
in
that
as
the
man
on
the
hill
saw
them
turn
their
herd
about
and
start
back
he
began
to
travel
slowly
downstream
all
that
day
and
even
into
the
night
he
went
before
them
showing
the
way
like
the
pillar
of
fire
said
marian
with
a
little
choke
in
her
voice
there
was
no
doubt
in
her
mind
that
this
benefactor
was
the
indian
they
had
befriended
when
he
was
starving
to
her
lips
there
came
a
line
she
had
long
known
i
was
an
hungered
and
ye
gave
me
not
wishing
to
camp
again
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
they
traveled
without
rest
or
food
for
eight
hours
at
last
when
they
were
so
hungry
and
weary
that
they
felt
they
must
drop
in
their
tracks
and
fall
asleep
they
came
suddenly
to
a
place
where
the
troubled
rush
of
waters
ceased
where
the
river
spread
out
into
a
broad
quiet
icebound
lake
thank
god
marian
murmured
reverently
as
she
dropped
exhausted
upon
her
sled
after
resting
and
eating
a
cold
lunch
of
hardtack
frozen
boiled
beans
and
reindeer
steak
they
headed
the
herd
across
the
lake
having
passed
through
the
narrow
forest
that
skirted
the
lake
they
came
upon
a
series
of
barren
hills
here
in
a
little
gully
lined
with
willows
whose
clinging
dead
leaves
rustled
incessantly
in
the
breeze
the
girls
made
camp
before
going
to
sleep
marian
walked
out
into
the
night
to
view
her
herd
the
sky
was
clear
the
golden
moon
made
the
night
light
as
day
the
herd
was
resting
peacefully
she
wondered
vaguely
if
other
human
beings
might
be
near
their
mysterious
guide
had
left
them
at
the
shore
of
the
lake
at
no
time
had
he
come
close
enough
to
be
identified
she
was
wondering
about
him
and
as
her
gaze
swept
the
horizon
she
saw
the
red
and
yellow
gleam
of
a
her
feeling
toward
that
had
changed
there
had
been
a
time
when
it
filled
her
with
fear
now
as
she
gazed
steadily
at
it
it
seemed
a
star
of
hope
a
protecting
fire
that
was
perhaps
to
go
with
them
all
their
long
journey
through
the
indian
s
camp
i
suppose
and
yet
she
asked
herself
is
it
it
might
be
the
tent
of
the
purple
flame
and
if
it
is
do
they
mean
us
good
or
ill
sleep
that
night
was
long
and
refreshing
they
awoke
next
morning
with
renewed
courage
before
them
lay
great
sweeping
stretches
of
tundra
for
days
without
a
single
new
adventure
they
pushed
on
toward
fort
jarvis
sometimes
beside
a
of
willows
marian
sat
wondering
how
they
were
coming
on
with
their
race
were
scarberry
and
his
herd
nearer
the
fort
than
they
there
was
no
way
to
tell
traveling
the
trackless
arctic
wilderness
is
like
sailing
the
boundless
sea
as
a
thousand
ships
might
pass
you
by
night
or
day
so
a
thousand
herds
taking
other
courses
might
pass
this
one
on
its
way
to
fort
jarvis
and
no
owner
know
of
the
others
passing
sometimes
too
she
thought
of
those
mysterious
camp
people
of
the
purple
flame
she
no
longer
feared
them
was
curious
about
them
that
was
all
no
longer
did
she
catch
the
gleam
of
their
light
by
night
had
they
turned
aside
gone
back
or
had
they
merely
extinguished
their
unusual
light
the
indians
she
thought
must
have
been
left
behind
they
would
not
travel
far
from
their
hunting
ground
they
had
been
served
and
had
served
in
turn
now
they
might
safely
be
forgotten
then
there
came
a
time
that
called
for
all
the
courage
and
endurance
their
natures
could
command
one
night
they
found
themselves
camped
among
the
foothills
of
a
range
of
mountains
the
mountains
a
row
of
alternating
triangles
of
deep
purple
and
light
yellow
lay
away
to
the
east
and
at
their
peaks
the
snow
tossed
high
in
air
by
the
incessant
gales
that
blew
there
made
each
peak
seem
a
smoking
volcano
said
terogloona
throwing
out
his
hand
in
a
sweeping
gesture
we
must
is
there
no
other
way
asked
patsy
must
do
said
terogloona
as
he
turned
to
the
task
of
putting
all
in
readiness
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
found
them
engaged
in
a
terrific
battle
with
the
blizzard
that
ever
raged
up
the
mountain
pass
which
they
must
cross
try
not
the
pass
the
old
man
said
the
storm
is
lowering
overhead
patsy
chanted
bravely
as
with
snow
encrusted
head
and
with
cheeks
that
must
be
rubbed
incessantly
to
prevent
them
from
freezing
she
struggled
forward
a
moment
later
as
a
fiercer
shock
seemed
about
to
lift
her
from
her
feet
and
hurl
her
down
the
mountain
side
marian
heard
her
fairly
shriek
into
the
teeth
of
the
gale
excelsior
excelsior
many
hard
battles
had
marian
fought
out
on
the
tundra
but
nothing
had
ever
equalled
this
the
snow
seeming
never
to
stop
shot
past
them
or
in
a
wild
whirling
eddy
dashed
into
their
faces
the
wind
tore
at
them
now
it
came
in
rude
gusts
and
now
poured
down
some
narrow
pass
with
all
the
force
of
the
waterfall
only
by
bending
low
and
leaping
into
it
could
they
make
progress
the
herd
plunged
stumblingly
forward
in
a
broad
line
the
dogs
incessantly
at
their
heels
urged
them
forward
terogloona
and
even
the
brave
attatak
did
all
in
their
power
to
keep
the
herd
moving
if
they
stop
oh
if
they
do
panted
marian
if
they
refuse
to
go
on
we
are
lost
if
only
we
reach
the
summit
i
am

we
will
be
safe

the
master
collie
completely
exhausted
and
blinded
by
the
snow
came
slinking
back
to
his
mistress
marian
rubbed
the
snow
from
the
eyes
of
the
faithful
dog
and
patting
his
side
bade
him
go
back
into
the
fight
tears
came
to
her
eyes
as
the
dog
bravely
returned
to
his
task
the
time
came
at
last
when
all
three
dogs
seemed
done
in
when
the
deer
all
but
stopped
when
it
seemed
impossible
that
they
might
be
kept
moving
another
five
minutes
then
it
was
that
the
indomitable
marian
sank
down
upon
her
sled
in
the
depths
of
despair

had
turned
about
to
rub

frost
from

cheeks
wolves
a
whole
pack

marian
wheeled
about
for
one
look
then
digging
into
her
pack
drew
forth
her
rifle

ll
die

she
murmured
as
she
took
steady
aim
at
the
foremost
member
of
the
pack
that
came
tearing
up
the
trail
she
was
about
to
press
the
trigger
when
patsy
gave
her
arm
a
sudden
pull

she
cried

chapter
xxvii
the
end
of
the
trail
troops
of
conflicting
hopes
and
fears
waged
battle
in
marian
s
brain
when
she
realized
that
the
pack
approaching
them
on
the
run
up
the
trail
in
the
teeth
of
the
storm
were
not
wolves
but
dogs
there
are
two
types
of
dogs
in
alaska
one
more
wolf
than
dog
is
the
native
wolf
dog
this
type
once
he
is
loosed
leaps
at
the
throat
of
the
first
reindeer
he
sees
a
pack
of
these
dogs
in
such
a
crisis
as
the
girls
were
now
facing
would
not
only
destroy
many
of
the
feebly
struggling
and
helpless
younger
deer
but
beyond
doubt
would
drive
the
remainder
of
the
herd
into
such
a
wild
panic
as
would
lose
them
to
their
owners
forever
were
the
dogs
of
this
or
the
other
men
s
dogs
who
treat
the
reindeer
as
they
might
cattle
or
sheep
and
merely
bark
at
them
and
drive
them
forward
if
they
were
white
men
s
dogs
they
might
save
the
day
for
the
barking
of
such
a
pack
as
fresh
for
the
struggle
they
appeared
to
be
would
doubtless
drive
the
exhausted
deer
to
renewed
efforts
and
carry
them
on
over
the
top
with
bated
breath
and
trembling
heart
marian
watched
their
approach
once
hope
fell
as
she
thought
she
caught
the
sharp
of
a
wolf
dog
in
this
she
must
have
been
mistaken
for
as
they
came
closer
she
saw
that
they
were
magnificent
fellows
with
an
unmistakable
collie
strain
in
their
blood
oh
she
cried
the
chariots
of
the
lord
and
the
horsemen
it
was
a
strange
expression
but
fitted
the
occasion
so
well
that
patsy
felt
her
heart
give
a
great
leap
of
joy
indeed
the
steeds
of
the
arctic
if
not
the
horsemen
had
come
to
their
aid
in
a
time
of
great
need
and
passing
them
with
a
wild
leap
the
dogs
burst
upon
the
deer
with
a
rush
and
roar
that
sent
them
forward
by
leaps
and
bounds
staggering
forward
the
girls
followed
as
best
they
could
now
they
were
a
thousand
yards
from
the
summit
now
five
hundred
now
three
now
two
and
now
the
first
deer
were
disappearing
over
the
top
enheartened
by
this
the
others
crowded
forward
until
with
one
final
rush
they
all
passed
over
the
top
and
started
down
on
the
other
side
just
as
the
girls
reached
the
crest
and
were
peering
over
the
summit
a
shrill
whistle
smote
their
ears
it
sounded
again
and
yet
again
there
was
a
movement
just
before
them
then
the
pack
of
dogs
rushed
past
them
on
the
back
trail
down
hill
someone
whistled
to
them
they
are
going
back
how
wonderfully
they
must
be
trained
exclaimed
patsy
they
were
someone
s
team
marian
said
slowly
as
if
for
the
first
time
realizing
they
had
not
really
been
sent
direct
from
heaven
to
save
them
they
re
somebody
s
team
he
knew
we
were
in
trouble
and
turned
the
dogs
loose
to
help
us
i
wonder
who
he
could
have
been
for
the
present
the
question
must
remain
unanswered
the
herd
had
gone
on
before
them
it
was
all
important
that
they
join
them
so
having
straightened
out
the
to
their
sleds
they
began
making
their
way
down
the
hard
packed
and
uncertain
descent
it
was
not
long
before
they
came
upon
the
herd
feeding
on
a
little
mountain
plateau
terogloona
was
already
busy
making
camp
and
attatak
thawing
out
food
over
a
fire
of
tiny
scrub
fir
trees
isn
t
it
wonderful
to
think
that
the
great
struggle
is
over
whispered
marian
contentedly
as
they
lounged
on
their
sleeping
bags
an
hour
later
this
is
really
the
worst
of
it
i
hope
fort
jarvis
can
t
be
more
than
four
days
away
now
over
a
smoother
down
if
only
we
are
in
time
sighed
patsy
we
must
be
oh
we
must
exclaimed
marian
passionately
surely
it
would
be
too
much
to
struggle
as
we
have
and
then
lose
before
marian
fell
asleep
she
set
her
mind
to
meet
any
outcome
of
their
adventure
she
thought
of
the
wonderful
opportunities
the
sale
of
the
herd
would
bring
to
her
father
and
herself
near
some
splendid
school
they
must
rent
a
bungalow
there
she
would
keep
house
for
him
and
go
to
school
in
her
mind
she
saw
the
wonderful
roses
that
bloomed
around
their
and
pictured
the
glorious
sunsets
they
would
view
from
their
back
door
perhaps
too
she
told
herself
patsy
could
live
with
us
for
a
year
or
two
and
attend
my
when
she
had
pictured
all
this
she
saw
in
her
mind
that
the
race
had
been
lost
that
scarberry
had
sold
his
herd
to
the
canadian
officials
that
she
was
to
turn
the
heads
of
her
leading
reindeer
toward
the
home
tundra
with
great
difficulty
at
first
but
with
ever
increasing
enthusiasm
in
her
imagination
she
drove
the
herd
all
the
way
back
to
enter
once
more
upon
the
wild
free
life
of
the
herder
it
really
does
not
matter
she
told
herself
it
s
really
only
for
father
he
is
so
lonely
down
there
all
by
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
knew
that
it
did
matter
mattered
a
very
great
deal
indeed
brave
girl
that
she
was
she
only
prepared
her
mind
for
the
shock
that
would
come
if
the
race
were
really
lost
four
days
later
the
two
girls
found
themselves
approaching
a
small
village
of
log
cabins
and
long
buildings
this
was
fort
jarvis
they
had
made
the
remainder
of
the
journey
in
safety
leaving
their
herd
some
ten
miles
from
the
fort
where
the
deer
would
be
safe
they
had
tramped
in
on
snowshoes
marian
found
her
heart
fluttering
painfully
as
her
feet
fell
in
the
village
path
had
scarberry
been
there
was
the
race
lost
had
the
man
of
the
purple
flame
been
there
had
he
anything
to
do
with
the
deal
twice
they
asked
directions
of
passing
indians
at
last
they
knocked
at
a
door
the
door
swung
open
and
they
found
themselves
inside
a
long
low
room
at
a
table
close
to
an
open
fire
sat
a
man
in
uniform
he
rose
and
bowed
as
they
came
toward
him
are
the
agent
for
the
canadian
government
marian
faltered
addressing
the
man
in
uniform
the
man
nodded
his
head
and
smiled
a
little
welcome
you
wish
to
buy
a
reindeer
herd
marian
asked
the
question
i
believe
the
man
answered
quietly
that
i
have
already
agreed
to
purchase
marian
sank
to
a
chair
the
shock
was
too
much
you
see
the
truth
is
smiled
the
major
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
i
believe
i
have
agreed
to
purchase
your
my
herd
exclaimed
marian
unable
to
believe
her
ears
but
how
did
you
know
of
my
did
you
know
i
was
on
the
way
who
told
one
question
at
a
time
young
lady
laughed
the
major
i
think
i
have
a
number
of
surprises
for
you
as
to
your
first
question
i
will
say
that
i
have
never
heard
of
your
herd
until
two
days
ago
that
day
two
days
after
the
great
storm
a
half
famished
indian
reached
fort
jarvis
driving
a
splendid
team
of
white
men
s
dogs
they
had
been
hard
driven
after
we
had
fed
him
he
jerkily
told
us
the
story
of
your
race
against
a
man
named
scarberry
he
told
us
of
the
treatment
you
had
given
him
of
your
kindnesses
to
his
people
then
he
told
of
scarberry
told
how
scarberry
s
herd
had
been
delayed
and
held
up
along
the
trail
and
how
he
had
tried
to
be
of
help
to
you
then
he
told
of
your
battle
against
the
storm
and
how
once
you
were
safely
over
the
pass
he
had
driven
night
and
day
to
reach
here
his
hope
was
to
get
here
ahead
of
any
other
herd
and
intercede
for
you
such
loyalty
is
not
to
be
denied
and
i
told
him
that
should
your
herd
reach
here
in
good
shape
that
i
would
give
it
preference
even
should
scarberry
get
here
ahead
of
you
i
believe
that
answers
one
of
your
but
how
in
the
world
did
this
indian
know
that
the
government
had
agreed
to
purchase
a
herd
asked
marian
in
the
north
answered
the
major
rumor
flies
fast
even
over
seemingly
uninhabited
places
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
the
indian
will
know
what
is
going
on
even
if
he
does
have
but
little
to
say
now
to
business
i
understand
you
have
brought
the
herd
with
you
yes
answered
marian
they
are
at
our
camp
about
ten
miles
then
we
may
consider
the
deal
closed
there
remains
but
to
count
the
deer
to
weed
out
those
that
are
too
old
or
too
weak
for
the
final
drive
then
to
make
out
your
order
on
our
government
we
have
lapland
herders
who
will
assist
in
the
work
you
may
rest
here
with
us
until
the
count
is
completed
after
that
i
will
see
that
you
have
guides
and
for
the
passage
south
to
the
rail
oh
how
wonderful
exclaimed
patsy
impulsively
leaping
to
her
feet
but
bill
scarberry
she
asked
suddenly
did
he
really
win
no
smiled
the
major
he
has
not
yet
been
heard
from
so
you
won
the
race
after
good
exclaimed
patsy
i
could
never
have
been
happy
again
if
we
had
lost
even
if
marian
did
sell
her
after
a
night
s
rest
at
the
post
marian
and
patsy
felt
like
they
had
come
into
a
new
life
they
had
lain
awake
long
into
the
night
exchanging
excited
whispers
over
their
good
luck
the
next
morning
as
marian
was
passing
down
the
street
she
noticed
a
dog
team
there
was
something
about
the
leader
that
looked
familiar
one
glance
at
the
driver
brought
an
exclamation
of
surprise
to
her
lips
he
was
none
other
than
the
indian
she
had
saved
from
starvation
and
who
in
turn
had
served
as
her
guardian
angel
that
is
the
dog
team
that
came
to
our
rescue
in
the
blizzard
was
her
mental
comment
while
she
had
been
told
the
rest
of
the
story
by
the
major
she
preferred
to
have
the
story
from
the
man
s
own
lips
she
found
him
very
reluctant
to
talk
but
after
his
heart
had
been
warmed
by
a
splendid
meal
of
boiled
reindeer
meat
and
coffee
he
told
his
story
from
the
time
she
had
given
him
three
of
her
reindeer
until
the
present
moment
shortly
after
leaving
her
he
had
come
in
with
some
of
his
own
people
who
were
well
fed
and
prosperous
knowing
that
the
girls
were
headed
straight
for
trouble
and
feeling
very
grateful
to
them
he
had
persuaded
one
of
these
his
kinsmen
to
go
with
him
and
to
follow
the
reindeer
herd
with
his
team
of
white
men
s
dogs
it
had
been
they
who
had
driven
the
away
and
had
left
a
rifle
and
ammunition
for
the
girls
it
was
their
dog
team
that
had
been
released
from
the
sled
and
had
assisted
in
driving
the
reindeer
herd
over
the
mountain
but
why
did
you
do
all
this
marian
asked
the
man
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
he
asked
why
did
you
give
reindeer
because
you
were
in
and
you
a
faint
smile
played
across
his
face
you
too
were
in
need
indian
all
same
white
then
marian
understood
and
her
heart
was
filled
with
a
new
love
for
all
those
strange
people
who
inhabit
the
white
wilderness
the
next
day
marian
and
patsy
together
with
the
major
and
his
lapland
herders
went
out
to
marian
s
camp
and
there
began
the
business
of
sorting
and
counting
the
deer
this
work
continued
for
three
days
and
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
leaving
the
herd
in
charge
of
the
lapland
herders
marian
patsy
and
the
major
together
with
terogloona
and
attatak
started
for
fort
jarvis
by
way
of
deer
sled
topping
a
hill
some
two
miles
from
fort
jarvis
they
suddenly
came
upon
a
tent
just
before
they
reached
it
the
interior
became
suddenly
lighted
with
a
strange
purple
flame
marian
halted
her
deer
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
the
purple
flame
she
gasped
and
turning
to
the
major
said
i
can
stand
this
mystery
no
longer
do
you
know
who
is
in
that
tent
why
yes
i
think
so
said
the
major
i
think
it
is
montgomery
an
old
prospector
he
is
well
known
throughout
the
north
why
do
you
ask
i
want
to
meet
him
said
marian
will
you
please
come
with
me
to
his
tent
a
moment
later
a
hearty
old
man
came
to
the
door
of
the
tent
in
response
to
their
call
and
with
a
cheery
smile
acknowledged
the
major
s
introduction
of
marian
and
patsy
at
once
inviting
them
in
imagine
marian
s
surprise
when
upon
entering
the
tent
she
saw
a
young
girl
of
about
her
own
age
seated
at
a
radio
sending
set
and
there
under
the
deft
fingers
of
the
girl
operator
a
crackling
purple
flash
jumped
back
and
forth
across
a
wide
spark
gap
the
girl
of
the
purple
flame
gasped
patsy
at
sound
of
her
voice
the
girl
turned
around
and
smiled
a
welcome
marian
turned
to
montgomery
so
you
are
the
people
of
the
purple
are
we
indeed
laughed
the
old
prospector
yes
said
marian
and
i
thought
all
the
while
back
there
in
alaska
that
you
were
dogging
our
footsteps
and
to
speak
honestly
we
feared
well
well
laughed
the
old
gentleman
so
that
was
your
reindeer
camp
we
thought
all
the
while
that
were
dogging
then
the
old
prospector
launched
into
a
long
story
that
cleared
up
the
entire
mystery
of
the
purple
flame
it
appeared
that
in
his
youth
he
had
been
a
prospector
in
alaska
and
had
found
a
very
rich
vein
of
gold
ill
health
had
overtaken
him
and
he
had
been
forced
to
return
to
the
states
years
passed
and
fortune
and
wealth
had
come
to
him
but
the
lure
of
searching
for
gold
was
still
in
his
veins
and
in
the
end
he
had
come
again
to
alaska
thinking
to
find
his
mine
the
years
had
somewhat
dimmed
his
memory
and
he
had
searched
in
vein
for
the
lost
mine
moving
from
day
to
day
he
had
been
just
as
surprised
to
note
that
marian
s
camp
moved
with
him
as
was
marian
to
discover
that
his
camp
moved
with
hers
in
time
he
had
become
suspicious
fearing
that
they
were
dogging
his
footsteps
he
knew
that
he
had
been
well
known
throughout
the
north
in
the
past
and
he
feared
that
others
knew
of
his
lost
mine
and
that
concluded
montgomery
is
the
reason
i
never
called
at
your
and
that
radio
set
said
marian
with
its
flash
of
purple
flame
is
the
reason
that
i
never
called
at
your
camp
there
was
something
so
mysterious
about
it
the
old
prospector
smiled
i
suppose
he
said
that
my
having
a
sending
and
receiving
radio
set
is
a
bit
strange
and
perhaps
a
little
mysterious
certainly
the
set
is
a
bit
strange
for
to
my
knowledge
there
is
not
another
set
like
it
in
the
country
it
is
very
compact
and
yet
most
powerful
you
see
my
interests
in
the
outside
are
very
extensive
and
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
keep
in
touch
with
them
by
the
use
of
this
set
i
can
keep
in
touch
with
my
agent
in
nome
and
he
in
turn
can
keep
in
touch
with
the
states
by
use
of
the
cable
it
was
the
spark
of
my
set
while
sending
that
made
the
purple
colored
flash
which
kept
you
so
mystified
you
know
most
mysterious
things
become
quite
simple
when
you
find
out
all
about
them
this
radio
has
made
it
possible
for
me
to
come
back
and
look
for
my
lost
mine
it
s
the
lure
of
the
thing
that
draws
me
not
the
desire
for
the
and
then
it
was
that
marian
remembering
the
treasures
that
she
had
found
in
the
cave
on
the
enchanted
mountain
and
feeling
that
she
had
something
in
common
with
this
old
prospector
told
him
her
story
as
she
told
of
the
carved
ivory
the
old
man
s
eyes
glowed
with
delight
and
in
the
end
he
insisted
that
he
go
into
fort
jarvis
with
them
that
he
might
at
least
see
the
piece
they
had
brought
along
and
hear
terogloona
s
story
at
the
post
old
terogloona
in
a
halting
way
read
the
pictured
inscription
on
the
four
sides
other
bits
of
information
furnished
by
terogloona
convinced
the
old
prospector
that
terogloona
s
had
been
his
guide
in
the
days
when
he
was
first
prospecting
and
had
found
the
mine
montgomery
wanted
to
set
out
at
once
with
terogloona
and
attatak
for
the
cave
on
the
mountain
why
he
exclaimed
that
s
very
near
my
lost
mine
for
i
remember
that
my
old
guide
terogloona
s
spoke
of
the
cave
as
a
place
where
we
might
winter
in
safety
should
winter
come
down
upon
us
before
we
expected
how
wonderful
said
marian
we
have
just
completed
the
count
and
sale
of
our
deer
patsy
and
i
are
going
back
to
the
states
and
i
am
sure
terogloona
and
attatak
will
go
with
you
and
you
will
be
in
good
hands
she
added
giving
both
of
the
faithful
servants
a
glowing
smile
the
sale
of
the
deer
was
successfully
completed
after
a
much
needed
rest
the
girls
began
the
long
journey
to
the
so
far
were
they
from
the
strange
cabin
of
the
recluse
musician
they
were
unable
to
return
for
the
treasure
they
had
taken
from
the
mountain
cave
many
months
passed
and
then
one
day
as
the
two
girls
returned
from
an
afternoon
of
shopping
in
chicago
marian
found
a
registered
package
awaiting
her
from
its
bulk
and
from
the
many
upon
it
she
knew
at
once
that
it
contained
the
long
awaited
ancient
treasure
her
fingers
trembled
as
she
undid
the
many
wrappings
when
at
last
she
came
to
the
treasure
she
found
each
piece
separately
wrapped
the
copper
instruments
and
the
old
ivory
pieces
were
just
as
she
had
found
them
tarnished
and
blackened
with
age
but
what
s
this
she
held
up
before
patsy
s
astonished
eyes
a
green
bowl
which
gleamed
in
the
light
like
a
crystal
why
exclaimed
patsy
as
she
saw
her
cousin
unpack
another
and
another
and
yet
another
he
has
thought
your
old
dishes
were
useless
and
has
sent
you
some
of
his
exquisite
glassware
how
strange
murmured
marian
ready
to
cry
with
disappointment
she
had
so
hoped
to
surprise
cole
the
curator
of
the
museum
with
rare
pieces
of
ancient
pottery
such
as
had
never
before
been
brought
from
the
arctic
and
here
were
only
four
pieces
of
glassware
how
they
had
ever
come
to
be
here
she
could
not
guess
but
here
they
were
look
cried
patsy
what
a
strange
appearance
they
have
when
you
hold
them
to
the
light
and
see
two
of
them
are
blue
and
two
are
a
tawny
green
like
huge
cat
s
wait
said
marian
here
is
a
note
from
our
aged
she
unfolded
it
and
read
it
aloud
please
pardon
an
old
man
s
fancy
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
polishing
these
up
a
bit
the
very
sight
of
them
makes
me
envious
they
are
indeed
a
rare
find
i
have
a
guess
as
to
what
they
are
made
of
but
your
friend
the
curator
will
so
exclaimed
patsy
they
are
the
very
dishes
you
found
in
the
cave
how
very
very
strange
we
must
have
cole
come
over
at
once
said
marian
half
beside
herself
with
curiosity
she
raced
to
the
telephone
and
a
moment
later
had
the
curator
on
the
wire
if
you
have
read
our
other
book
the
cruise
of
the
o
moo
you
will
remember
that
marian
with
her
two
friends
lucile
and
florence
had
once
made
a
rare
find
for
the
museum
so
you
will
not
wonder
that
so
great
a
man
should
hurry
right
over
in
answer
to
their
call
when
he
arrived
marian
placed
one
of
the
bowls
in
his
hand
with
the
single
comment
from
a
cave
in
a
mountain
in
for
three
minutes
he
turned
the
bowl
about
before
the
light
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
about
it
there
was
a
strange
light
in
his
eye
almost
everything
exclaimed
marian
what
it
s
made
of
who
made
it
how
long
ago
wait
a
bit
not
so
fast
the
curator
held
up
a
hand
for
silence
you
should
know
what
it
s
made
of
he
smiled
what
was
the
blue
god
made
of
and
is
that
jade
too
blue
and
green
the
bowls
should
be
quite
decidedly
as
for
your
other
questions
much
more
information
is
needed
before
we
can
know
who
made
them
and
when
so
far
as
i
know
nothing
of
this
kind
has
ever
before
been
discovered
were
there
any
other
pieces
marian
held
out
a
handful
of
ivory
pieces
for
ten
minutes
there
was
silence
in
the
room
save
for
the
click
of
specimens
as
the
curator
turned
them
over
then
turning
suddenly
cole
put
out
his
hands
to
the
girls
i
want
to
congratulate
you
he
said
his
eyes
gleaming
upon
your
good
fortune
in
discovering
the
finest
collection
of
specimens
ever
brought
from
alaska
from
its
discoloration
this
ivory
should
be
at
least
five
hundred
years
old
the
bowls
are
doubtless
of
the
same
period
that
makes
them
on
hearing
these
words
marian
s
joy
knew
no
bounds
as
for
patsy
her
unselfish
pleasure
in
the
success
of
her
cousin
was
quite
as
great
as
if
it
had
been
she
who
had
made
the
find
it
was
arranged
that
cole
should
take
charge
of
the
specimens
and
should
advise
marian
in
regard
to
their
disposal
marian
s
dream
came
true
she
and
her
father
secured
the
bungalow
rose
bush
and
all
and
owned
it
free
from
debt
there
was
money
enough
left
for
her
education
as
for
patsy
she
was
glad
enough
to
hurry
back
to
rejoin
her
classmates
in
louisville
kentucky
an
unfortunate
part
of
having
plenty
of
money
is
that
it
is
likely
to
shut
out
from
one
s
life
the
thrills
that
come
with
a
struggle
for
an
existence
for
the
time
being
marian
s
life
lost
most
of
its
thrills
not
so
however
with
her
friend
lucille
tucker
you
will
remember
her
from
reading
the
blue
envelope
the
cruise
of
the
o
moo
and
the
secret
life
for
her
continued
to
have
thrills
our
next
book
the
crimson
thread
will
have
to
do
with
the
adventures
which
came
to
her
during
a
christmas
vacation
if
you
think
that
two
weeks
time
can
contain
but
few
adventures
this
book
will
prove
that
you
are
