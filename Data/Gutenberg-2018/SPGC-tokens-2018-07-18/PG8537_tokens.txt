chapter
i
the
arrival
of
val
in
northern
montana
there
lies
a
great
lonely
stretch
of
prairie
land
gashed
deep
where
flows
the
missouri
indeed
there
are
many
such
big
impassive
impressive
in
their
very
loneliness
in
summer
given
over
to
the
winds
and
the
meadow
larks
and
to
the
shadows
fleeing
always
over
the
hilltops
wild
range
cattle
feed
there
and
grow
sleek
and
fat
for
the
fall
shipping
of
beef
at
night
the
coyotes
yap
quaveringly
and
prowl
abroad
after
the
jack
rabbits
which
bounce
away
at
their
approach
in
winter
it
is
not
good
to
be
there
even
the
beasts
shrink
then
from
the
bleak
level
reaches
and
shun
the
still
bleaker
heights
but
men
will
live
anywhere
if
by
so
doing
there
is
money
to
be
gained
and
so
a
town
snuggled
up
against
the
northern
rim
of
the
bench
land
where
the
bleakness
was
softened
a
bit
by
the
sheltering
hills
and
a
creek
with
wild
rosebushes
and
chokecherries
made
a
vivid
green
background
for
the
meager
huddle
of
little
unpainted
buildings
to
the
passengers
on
the
through
trains
which
watered
at
the
red
tank
near
the
creek
the
place
looked
crudely
picturesque
interesting
so
long
as
one
was
not
compelled
to
live
there
and
could
retain
a
perfectly
impersonal
viewpoint
after
five
or
ten
minutes
spent
hi
watching
curiously
the
one
little
street
with
the
long
hitching
poles
planted
firmly
and
frequently
down
both
sides
usually
within
a
very
few
steps
of
a
saloon
door
and
the
horses
nodding
and
stamping
at
the
flies
and
the
loitering
figures
that
appeared
now
and
then
in
desultory
fashion
many
of
them
imagined
that
they
understood
the
west
and
sympathized
with
it
and
appreciated
its
bigness
and
its
freedom
from
conventions
one
slim
young
woman
had
just
told
the
school
teacher
on
a
vacation
with
whom
she
had
formed
one
of
those
evanescent
traveling
acquaintances
that
she
already
knew
the
west
from
instinct
and
from
manley
letters
she
loved
it
she
said
because
manley
loved
it
and
because
it
was
to
be
her
home
and
because
it
was
so
big
and
so
free
out
here
one
could
think
and
grow
and
really
live
she
declared
with
enthusiasm
manley
had
lived
here
for
three
years
and
his
letters
she
told
the
teacher
were
an
education
in
themselves
the
teacher
had
already
learned
that
the
slim
young
woman
with
the
hair
and
eyes
to
match
was
going
to
marry
manley
she
had
forgotten
his
other
name
though
the
young
woman
had
mentioned
it
and
would
live
on
a
ranch
a
cattle
ranch
she
smiled
with
somewhat
wistful
sympathy
and
hoped
the
young
woman
would
be
happy
and
the
young
woman
waved
her
hand
with
the
glove
only
half
pulled
on
toward
the
prairie
and
the
creek
and
the
hills
beyond
happy
she
echoed
joyously
could
one
be
anything
else
in
such
a
country
and
then
you
do
know
manley
you
see
it
horribly
bad
form
and
undignified
and
all
that
to
prate
of
one
private
affairs
but
i
just
ca
help
bubbling
over
i
not
looking
for
heaven
and
i
expect
to
have
plenty
of
bumpy
places
in
the
trail
trail
is
anything
that
you
travel
over
out
here
manley
has
coached
me
faithfully
but
i
going
to
be
happy
my
mind
is
quite
made
up
well
i
so
glad
you
happened
to
be
on
this
train
and
i
wish
i
might
meet
you
again
is
it
a
funny
little
depot
oh
yes
thank
you
i
almost
forgot
that
umbrella
and
i
might
need
it
yes
i
write
to
you
i
should
hate
to
drop
out
of
your
mind
completely
address
me
manley
fleetwood
hope
montana
i
wish
she
trailed
off
down
the
aisle
with
eyes
shining
in
the
wake
of
the
grinning
porter
she
hurried
down
the
steps
glanced
hastily
along
the
platform
up
at
the
car
window
where
the
faded
little
school
teacher
was
smiling
wearily
down
at
her
waved
her
hand
threw
a
dainty
little
kiss
nodded
a
gay
farewell
smiled
vaguely
at
the
conductor
who
had
been
respectfully
pleasant
to
her
and
then
she
was
looking
at
the
rear
platform
of
the
receding
train
mechanically
not
yet
quite
realizing
why
it
was
that
her
heart
went
heavy
so
suddenly
she
turned
then
and
looked
about
her
in
a
surprised
inquiring
fashion
manley
it
would
seem
was
not
at
hand
to
welcome
her
she
had
expected
his
face
to
be
the
first
she
looked
upon
in
that
town
but
she
tried
not
to
be
greatly
perturbed
at
his
absence
so
many
things
may
detain
one
at
that
moment
a
young
fellow
whose
clothes
emphatically
proclaimed
him
a
cowboy
came
diffidently
up
to
her
tilted
his
hat
backward
an
inch
or
so
and
left
it
that
way
thereby
unconsciously
giving
himself
an
air
of
candor
which
should
have
been
reassuring
fleetwood
was
detained
you
were
expecting
to
you
the
lady
he
was
expecting
are
you
she
had
been
looking
questioningly
at
her
violin
box
and
two
trunks
standing
on
their
ends
farther
down
the
platform
and
she
smiled
vaguely
without
glancing
at
him
yes
i
hope
he
is
sick
or
i
take
you
over
to
the
hotel
and
go
tell
him
you
here
he
volunteered
somewhat
curtly
and
picked
up
her
bag
oh
thank
this
time
her
eyes
grazed
his
face
inattentively
she
followed
him
down
the
rough
steps
of
planking
and
up
an
extremely
dusty
road
one
could
scarcely
call
it
a
street
to
an
uninviting
building
with
crooked
windows
and
a
high
false
front
of
unpainted
boards
the
young
fellow
opened
a
sagging
door
let
her
pass
into
a
narrow
hallway
and
from
there
into
a
stuffy
hopelessly
conventional
parlor
handed
her
the
bag
and
departed
with
another
tilt
of
the
hat
which
placed
it
at
a
different
angle
the
sentence
meant
for
farewell
she
did
not
catch
for
she
was
staring
at
a
portrait
upon
an
easel
the
portrait
of
a
man
with
a
drooping
mustache
and
porky
cheeks
and
eyes
and
i
expected
bearskin
rugs
and
antlers
on
the
walls
and
big
fireplaces
she
remarked
aloud
and
sighed
then
she
turned
and
pulled
aside
a
coarse
curtain
of
dusty
lace
and
looked
after
her
guide
he
was
just
disappearing
into
a
saloon
across
the
street
and
she
dropped
the
curtain
precipitately
as
if
she
were
ashamed
of
spying
oh
well
i
heard
all
cowboys
are
more
or
less
intemperate
she
excused
again
aloud
she
sat
down
upon
an
atrocious
red
plush
chair
and
wrinkled
her
nose
spitefully
at
the
portrait
i
suppose
you
the
proprietor
she
accused
or
else
the
proprietor
son
i
wish
you
would
squint
like
that
if
i
have
to
stop
here
longer
than
ten
minutes
i
shall
certainly
turn
you
face
to
the
whereupon
with
another
grimace
she
turned
her
back
upon
it
and
looked
out
of
the
window
then
she
stood
up
impatiently
looked
at
her
watch
and
sat
down
again
upon
the
red
plush
chair
he
did
tell
me
whether
manley
is
sick
she
said
suddenly
with
some
resentment
he
was
awfully
abrupt
in
his
manner
oh
you
she
rose
picked
up
an
old
newspaper
from
the
table
with
uncertain
legs
and
spread
it
ungently
over
the
portrait
upon
the
easel
then
she
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
again
i
feel
perfectly
sure
that
cowboy
went
and
got
drunk
immediately
she
complained
drumming
pettishly
upon
the
glass
and
i
do
suppose
he
told
manley
at
the
cowboy
was
innocent
of
the
charge
however
and
he
was
doing
his
energetic
best
to
tell
manley
he
had
gone
straight
through
the
saloon
and
into
the
small
room
behind
where
a
man
lay
sprawled
upon
a
bed
in
one
corner
he
was
asleep
and
his
clothes
were
wrinkled
as
if
he
had
lain
there
long
his
head
rested
upon
his
folded
arms
and
he
was
snoring
loudly
the
young
fellow
went
up
and
took
him
roughly
by
the
shoulder
here
i
thought
i
told
you
to
straighten
up
he
cried
disgustedly
come
alive
the
train
come
and
gone
and
your
girl
waiting
for
you
over
to
the
hotel
d
you
hear
the
man
opened
one
eye
grunted
and
closed
it
again
the
other
yanked
him
half
off
the
bed
and
swore
this
brought
both
eyes
open
glassy
with
whisky
and
sleep
he
sat
wobbling
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
staring
stupidly
ca
you
get
anything
through
you
his
tormentor
exclaimed
you
want
your
girl
to
find
out
you
drunk
you
got
the
license
in
your
pocket
you
supposed
to
get
spliced
this
evening
and
look
at
you
he
turned
and
went
out
to
the
bartender
why
did
you
pour
that
coffee
into
him
like
i
told
you
he
demanded
we
got
to
get
him
steady
on
his
pins
the
bartender
was
sprawled
half
over
the
bar
apathetically
reading
the
sporting
news
of
a
torn
sunday
edition
of
an
eastern
paper
he
looked
up
from
under
his
eyebrows
and
grunted
how
you
going
to
pour
coffee
down
a
man
that
lays
flat
on
his
belly
and
wo
open
his
mouth
he
inquired
in
an
injured
tone
sleep
all
he
needs
anyway
he
be
all
right
by
the
other
snorted
dissent
he
be
all
right
by
dark
or
he
feel
a
whole
lot
worse
he
promised
grimly
dig
up
some
ice
and
a
good
jolt
of
bromo
if
you
got
it
and
a
towel
or
the
bartender
wearily
pushed
the
paper
to
one
side
reached
languidly
under
the
bar
and
laid
hold
of
a
round
blue
bottle
yawning
uninterestedly
he
poured
a
double
portion
of
the
white
crystals
into
a
glass
half
filled
another
under
the
faucet
of
the
water
cooler
and
held
them
out
dump
that
into
him
then
he
advised
it
help
some
if
you
get
it
down
what
the
sweat
to
get
him
married
off
wo
the
girl
wait
i
never
asked
her
you
pound
up
some
ice
and
bring
it
in
will
you
the
volunteer
nurse
kicked
open
the
door
into
the
little
room
and
went
in
hastily
pouring
the
bromo
seltzer
from
one
glass
to
the
other
to
keep
it
from
foaming
out
of
all
bounds
his
patient
was
still
sitting
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
where
he
had
left
him
slumped
forward
with
his
head
in
his
hands
he
looked
up
stupidly
his
eyes
bloodshot
and
swollen
of
lid
the
train
come
in
yet
he
asked
thickly
you
is
it
kent
the
train
come
and
your
girl
is
waiting
for
you
at
the
hotel
here
throw
this
into
you
and
for
god
sake
brace
up

me
tired

stuff

bottom

coat

can
get
at
you

much
like
getting
married
and
that
no
fleetwood
shook
his
head
with
drunken
gravity
and
groaned
i
ought
to
be
killed
drunk
he
sagged
forward
again
and
seemed
disposed
to
shed
tears
she
never
forgive
me
she
kent
jerked
him
to
his
feet
peremptorily
aw
look
here
i
trying
to
sober
you
up
you
got
to
do
your
part
see
here
some
ice
in
a
towel
you
get
it
on
your
head
open
up
your
shirt
so
i
can
bathe
your
chest
do
do
any
good
to
blubber
around
about
it
your
girl
ca
hear
you
and
jim
and
i
ai
sympathetic
set
down
in
this
chair
where
we
can
get
at
he
enforced
his
command
with
some
vigor
and
fleetwood
groaned
again
but
he
shed
no
more
tears
and
he
grew
momentarily
more
lucid
as
the
treatment
took
effect
the
tears
were
being
shed
in
the
stuffy
little
hotel
parlor
the
young
woman
looked
often
at
her
watch
went
into
the
hallway
and
opened
the
outer
door
several
times
meditating
a
search
of
the
town
and
drew
back
always
with
a
timid
fluttering
of
heart
because
it
was
all
so
crude
and
strange
and
the
saloons
so
numerous
and
terrifying
in
their
very
bald
simplicity
she
was
worried
about
manley
and
she
wished
that
cowboy
would
come
out
of
the
saloon
and
bring
her
lover
to
her
she
had
never
dreamed
of
being
treated
in
this
way
no
one
came
near
her
and
she
had
secretly
expected
to
cause
something
of
a
flutter
in
this
little
town
they
called
hope
surely
young
girls
from
the
east
come
out
to
get
married
to
their
sweethearts
were
so
numerous
that
they
should
be
ignored
if
there
were
other
people
in
the
hotel
they
did
not
manifest
their
presence
save
by
disquieting
noises
muffled
by
intervening
partitions
she
grew
thirsty
but
she
hesitated
to
explore
the
depths
of
this
dreary
abode
in
fear
of
worse
horrors
than
the
parlor
furniture
and
all
the
places
of
refreshment
which
she
could
see
from
the
window
or
the
door
looked
terribly
masculine
and
unmoral
and
as
if
they
did
not
know
there
existed
such
things
as
ice
cream
or
soda
or
sherbet
it
was
after
an
hour
of
this
that
the
tears
came
which
is
saying
a
good
deal
for
her
courage
it
seemed
to
her
then
that
manley
must
be
dead
what
else
could
keep
him
so
long
away
from
her
after
three
years
of
impassioned
longing
written
twice
a
week
with
punctilious
regularity
he
knew
that
she
was
coming
she
had
telegraphed
from
paul
and
had
received
a
joyful
reply
lavishly
expressed
in
seventeen
words
instead
of
the
limit
and
they
were
to
have
been
married
immediately
upon
her
arrival
that
cowboy
had
known
she
was
coming
he
must
also
have
known
why
manley
did
not
meet
her
and
she
wished
futilely
that
she
had
questioned
him
instead
of
walking
beside
him
without
a
word
he
should
have
explained
he
would
have
explained
if
he
had
not
been
so
very
anxious
to
get
inside
that
saloon
and
get
drunk
she
had
always
heard
that
cowboys
were
chivalrous
and
brave
and
fascinating
in
their
picturesque
but
from
the
lone
specimen
which
she
had
met
she
could
not
see
that
they
possessed
any
of
those
qualities
if
all
cowboys
were
like
that
she
hoped
that
she
would
not
be
compelled
to
meet
any
of
them
and
did
manley
come
it
was
then
that
an
inner
door
a
door
which
she
had
wanted
to
open
but
had
lacked
courage
squeaked
upon
its
hinges
and
an
bundle
of
hair
was
thrust
in
topping
a
face
and
a
scrawny
little
body
two
faded
inquisitive
eyes
looked
her
over
and
the
woman
sidled
in
somewhat
abashed
but
too
curious
to
remain
outside
oh
yes
she
seemed
to
be
answering
some
inner
question
i
did
know
you
was
she
went
over
and
removed
the
newspaper
from
the
portrait
that
breed
girl
of
mine
ai
got
the
least
idea
of
how
to
straighten
up
a
room
she
observed
complainingly
i
guess
she
thinks
this
picture
was
made
to
hang
things
on
i
have
to

real
handsome
man

brighten
up

turrible
he
took
and
tied
a
string
to
the
trigger
oh

the
landlady
stopped
short
and
stared
at
her
what
oh
i
wo
go
into
details
it
was
awful
messy
and
that
a
fact
i
did
git
over
it
for
a
couple
of
months
he
coulda
killed
himself
with
a
it

a
mystery
why
he
dug
up
that
old
shotgun

wanted
to
show

she
sighed
and
drew
her
fingers
across
her
eyes
i
do

over
it
she
added
complacently
it

a
turrible

girl
and
her
eyes

again
with
tears
i
afraid

have
happened
to
him
he
hawley
glimpsed
the
tears
and
instantly
became
motherly
in
her
manner
she
even
went
up
and
patted
the
girl
on
the
shoulder
there
now
do
you
worry
none
man
all
right
i
seen
him
at
dinner
time
he
was
she
stopped
short
looked
keenly
at
the
delicate
face
and
at
the
eyes
which
gazed
back
at
her
innocent
of
evil
trusting
wistful
he
spoke
about
your

said

of
the
parlor
this
evening
for

an
idea

maybe
he
thought
so
too
i
never
heard

i
was
busy
frying
doughnuts
in
the
kitchen
and
i
just
happened
to
come
in
here
after
something
you
oughta
rapped
on
that
door
then
i
known
you
was
here

go

my
old
man
hunt
him
up

be
around

smiled
reassuringly
as
she
turned
to
the
inner
door

and
jacket
and
pretty
soon
i
show
you

a
room

quizzically
to
the
portrait
you

walt
keep
you
company
till
i
get

he
was
real
good
company
when
he
was
she
smiled

and
went
out
briskly
came
back
and
stood
with
her
hand
upon
the
cracked
doorknob
i
clean
forgot
your
name
she
hinted

time
but

usually
at
the
homesickness
of
the
girl
shone
in

misty
eyes
haunted

read
it
and
spoke
more
briskly
than
she
would
otherwise
have
done
well
we
plumb
strangers
but

glad

so
awful
many
women
in
the
country
we
have
to
rake
and
scrape
to
git
enough
for

sets
when

dance
and
more
likely

somebody
said
they
seen
a
fiddle
box
down
to
the
depot
with
a
couple
of
big
trunks

the
fiddle
a
little
valeria
smiled
faintly
well
that
come
in
awful
handy
at

real
often
in
the
winter
if

such
a
job

too
much
to
do

be
standin

the
time

fellow

yourself
to

and
anything

in
the
she
smiled
in
friendly
fashion
and
closed
the
door
with
a
little
slam
to
make
sure
that
it
latched
valeria
stood
for
a
moment
with
her
hands
hanging
straight
at
her
sides
staring
absently
at
the
door
then
she
glanced
at
walt
staring
from
his
gilt
frame
upon
his
gilt
easel
and
shivered
she
pushed
the
red
plush
chair
as
far
away
from
him
as
possible
sat
down
with
her
back
to
the
picture
and
immediately
felt
his
dull
black
eyes
boring
into
her
back
what
a
fool
i
must
be
she
said
aloud
glancing
reluctantly
over
her
shoulder
at
the
portrait
she
got
up
resolutely
placed
the
chair
where
it
had
stood
before
and
stared
deliberately
at
walt
as
if
she
would
prove
how
little
she
cared
but
in
a
moment
more
she
was
crying
dismally
chapter
ii
advice
kent
burnett
bearing
over
his
arm
a
coat
newly
pressed
in
the
delmonico
restaurant
dodged
in
at
the
back
door
of
the
saloon
threw
the
coat
down
upon
the
tousled
bed
and
pushed
back
his
hat
with
a
gesture
of
relief
at
an
onerous
duty
well
performed
i
had
one
hell
of
a
time
he
announced
plaintively
and
that
chink
will
likely
try
to
poison
me
if
i
eat
over
there
after
this
but
i
got
her
ironed
all
right
get
into
it
man
and
chase
yourself
over
there
to
the
hotel
got
a
clean
collar
that
one
fleetwood
stifled
a
groan
reached
into
a
trousers
pocket
and
brought
up
a
dollar
get
me
one
at
the
store
will
you
kent
fifteen
and
a
half
and
a
tie
if
they
got
any
that
decent
and
hurry
such
a
fool
as
i
am
ought
to
be
taken
out
and
he
went
on
cursing
himself
audibly
and
bitterly
even
after
kent
had
hurried
out
he
was
sober
now
was
manley
fleetwood
sober
and
and
penitent
his
head
ached
splittingly
his
eyes
were
and
bloodshot
and
his
hands
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarcely
button
his
coat
but
he
was
sober
he
did
not
even
carry
the
odor
of
whisky
upon
his
breath
or
his
person
for
kent
had
been
very
thoughtful
and
very
thorough
he
had
compelled
his
patient
to
crunch
and
swallow
many
nauseous
tablets
of
whisky
killer
and
he
had
sprinkled
his
clothes
liberally
with
jockey
club
fleetwood
therefore
while
he
emanated
odors
in
plenty
carried
about
him
none
of
the
aroma
properly
belonging
to
intoxication
in
ten
minutes
kent
was
back
with
a
celluloid
collar
and
two
ties
of
questionable
taste
manley
just
glanced
at
them
waved
them
away
with
gloomy
finality
and
swore
they
just
about
the
limit
and
that
no
dream
sympathized
kent
but
they
clean
and
they
do
look
like
they
been
slept
in
for
a
month
you
got
to
put
on
by
george
i
sized
up
the
layout
in
both
those
imitation
stores
and
i
drew
the
highest
in
the
deck
and
for
the
sake
get
a
move
on
here
i
button
it
for
behind
fleetwood
back
when
collar
and
tie
were
in
place
kent
grinned
and
lowered
an
eyelid
at
jim
who
put
his
head
in
from
the
saloon
to
see
how
far
the
sobering
had
progressed
you
look
fine
he
encouraged
heartily
that
tie
just
what
you
need
to
set
you
off
and
the
collar
sure
is
shiny
and
nice
your
girl
will
be
plumb
dazzled
she
wo
see
anything
wrong
believe
now
run
along
and
get
married
here
you
better
sneak
out
the
back
way
if
she
happened
to
be
looking
out
she
likely
wonder
what
you
were
doing
coming
out
of
a
saloon
duck
out
past
the
coal
shed
and
cut
into
the
street
by
brinberg
tell
her
you
sick
got
a
sick
headache
your
swear
it
the
truth
hike
he
opened
the
door
and
pushed
fleetwood
out
watched
him
out
of
sight
around
the
corner
of
brinberg
store
and
turned
back
into
the
little
room
do
you
know
he
remarked
to
jim
i
never
thought
of
it
before
but
been
playing
a
trick
on
that
poor
girl
i
kinda
wish
now
i
put
her
next
and
given
her
a
chance
to
draw
outa
the
game
if
she
wanted
to
it
stacking
the
deck
on
her
if
you
ask
he
pushed
his
hat
back
upon
his
head
gave
his
shoulders
a
twist
of
dissatisfaction
and
told
jim
to
dig
up
some
eastern
beer
drank
it
meditatively
and
set
down
the
glass
with
some
force
yes
sir
he
said
disgustedly
darn
my
fool
soul
i
stacked
the
deck
on
that
girl
and
she
looked
to
be
real
nice
kinda
innocent
and
trusting
like
she
has
found
out
yet
how
rotten
mean
men
critters
can
he
took
the
bottle
and
poured
himself
another
glass
she
sure
due
to
wise
up
a
lot
he
added
grimly
you
bet
your
sweet
life
jim
agreed
and
then
he
reconsidered
still
i
dunno
man
ai
so
worse
he
ai
what
you
can
call
a
real
booze
fighter
this
here
what
i
call
an
accidental
jag
got
it
in
the
exuberance
of
the
joyful
moment
when
he
knew
his
girl
was
coming
he
likely
straighten
up
and
be
all
right
he
jim
broke
off
there
and
looked
to
see
who
had
opened
the
door
hello
polly
he
greeted
carelessly
the
man
came
forward
grinning
skinnily
polycarp
jenks
was
the
outrageous
name
of
him
he
was
under
the
average
height
and
he
was
lean
to
the
point
of
emaciation
his
mouth
was
absolutely
curveless
a
straight
gash
across
his
face
a
gash
which
simply
stopped
short
without
any
tapering
or
any
turn
at
the
corners
when
it
had
reached
as
far
as
was
decent
his
nose
was
also
straight
and
high
and
owned
no
perceptible
slope
indeed
it
seemed
merely
a
pendant
attached
to
his
forehead
and
its
upper
termination
was
indefinite
except
that
somewhere
between
his
eyebrows
one
felt
impelled
to
consider
it
forehead
rather
than
nose
his
eyes
also
were
rather
long
and
narrow
like
buttonholes
cut
to
match
the
mouth
when
he
grinned
his
face
appeared
to
break
up
into
splinters
he
was
intensely
proud
of
his
name
and
his
pleasure
was
almost
pathetic
when
one
pronounced
it
without
curtailment
in
his
presence
his
skinniness
was
also
a
matter
of
pride
and
when
you
realize
that
he
was
an
indefatigable
gossip
and
seemed
always
to
be
riding
at
large
gathering
or
imparting
trivial
news
you
should
know
fairly
well
polycarp
jenks
i
see
man
fleetwood
might
near
sober
enough
to
git
married
polycarp
began
coming
up
to
the
two
and
leaning
a
sharp
elbow
upon
the
bar
beside

off

glass
of
soda
because
he
disliked
to
offend
funny
i
did
hear
about
polycarp
twisted
his
slit
of
a
mouth
knowingly
and
closed
one
slit
of
an
eye
to
assist
the
facial
elucidation
ai
funny
not
when
i
tell

set
on
the
wagon
seat

hold

lines
not

the
thing

might
well
git
in
on
the
fun
they
wo
be
no
sleepin
within
ten
mile
of

nohow
and
a
feller
always
sees
the
joke
better
when
he
lendin
a
hand
too
bad
you
an
fred
on
the
outs
oh
i
do
know
it
suits
me
fine
kent
declared
easily
setting
down
his
glass
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
hated
what
it
all
about
anyway
quizzed
polycarp
hungering
for
the
details
which
had
thus
far
been
denied
him
de
garmo
sees
red
whenever
anybody
mentions
your
name
kenneth
but
i
never
did
hear
no
no
kent
was
turning
toward
the
door
well
you
see
fred
claims
he
can
holler
louder
than
i
can
and
i
say
he
he
opened
the
door
and
calmly
departed
leaving
polycarp
looking
exceedingly
foolish
and
a
bit
angry
straight
to
the
hotel
without
any
pretense
at
disguising
his
destination
marched
kent
he
went
into
the
office
which
was
really
a
saloon
invited
hawley
to
drink
with
him
and
then
wondered
audibly
if
he
could
beg
some
pie
from
hawley
supper
be
ready
in
a
few
minutes
hawley
informed
him
glancing
up
at
the
round
clock
screwed
to
the
wall
i
do
want
supper
i
want
pie
kent
retorted
and
opened
a
door
which
led
into
the
hallway
he
went
down
the
narrow
passage
to
another
door
opened
it
without
ceremony
and
was
assailed
by
the
odor
of
many
things
the
odor
which
spoke
plainly
of
supper
or
some
other
assortment
of
food
no
one
was
in
sight
so
he
entered
the
dining
room
boldly
stepped
to
another
door
tapped
very
lightly
upon
it
and
went
in
by
this
somewhat
roundabout
method
he
invaded
the
parlor
manley
fleetwood
was
lying
upon
an
extremely
uncomfortable
couch
of
the
kind
which
is
called
a
sofa
he
had
a
handkerchief
folded
upon
his
brow
and
upon
his
face
was
an
expression
of
conscious
unworthiness
which
struck
kent
as
being
extremely
humorous
he
grinned
understandingly
and
manley
flushed
also
understandingly
valeria
hastily
released
hand
and
looked
very
prim
and
a
bit
haughty
as
she
regarded
the
intruder
from
the
red
plush
chair
pulled
close
to
the
couch
mr
fleetwood
head
is
very
bad
yet
she
informed
kent
coldly
i
really
do
not
think
he
ought
to
see
kent
tapped
his
hat
gently
against
his
leg
and
faced
her
unflinchingly
quite
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
she
regarded
him
as
a
dissolute
drunken
cowboy
with
whom
manley
ought
not
to
associate
that
too
his
eyes
failed
to
drop
guiltily
before
hers
but
continued
to
regard
her
calmly
i
only
going
to
stay
a
minute
i
came
to
tell
you
that
there
a
scheme
to
raise
to
you
two
tonight
i
thought
you
might
want
to
pull
out
along
about
manley
looked
up
at
him
inquiringly
with
the
eye
which
was
not
covered
by
the
handkerchief
valeria
seemed
startled
just
at
first
then
she
gave
kent
a
little
shock
of
surprise
i
have
read
about
such
things
a
even
out
here
in
this
uncivilized
section
of
the
country
can
hardly
be
dangerous
i
really
do
not
think
we
care
to
run
away
thank
her
lip
curled
unmistakably
mr
fleetwood
is
suffering
from
a
sick
headache
he
needs
rest
not
a
cowardly
night
naturally
kent
admired
the
spirit
she
showed
in
spite
of
that
eloquent
lip
the
scorn
of
which
seemed
aimed
directly
at
him
but
he
still
faced
her
steadily
sure
but
if
i
had
a
headache
like
that
i
certainly
burn
the
earth
getting
outa
town
he
stuck
stubbornly
to
his
own
way
of
saying
it
are
bad
for
the
head
they
are
what
you
could
call
silent
not
out
here
in
this
uncivilized
section
of
the
country
plumb
he
hesitated
for
just
a
fraction
of
a
second
and
his
resentment
of
her
tone
melted
into
a
twinkle
of
the
eyes
they
got
fifty
cans
strung
with
irons
on
a
rope
and
there
be
about
popping
and
eight
or
ten
and
they
all
be
yelling
to
beat
four
of
a
kind
they
going
he
said
quite
gravely
to
play
the
full
orchestra
and
i
do
believe
he
added
ironically
going
to
help
fleetwood
head
valeria
looked
at
him
doubtingly
with
steady
eyes
before
she
turned
solicitously
to
readjust
the
handkerchief
kent
seized
the
opportunity
to
stare
fixedly
at
fleetwood
and
jerk
his
head
meaningly
backward
but
when
warned
by
manley
changing
expression
she
glanced
suspiciously
over
her
shoulder
kent
was
standing
quietly
by
the
door
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
gazing
absently
at
walt
in
his
frame
upon
the
gilt
easel
and
waiting
evidently
for
their
decision
i
shall
tell
them
that
fleetwood
is
sick
that
he
has
a
horrible
headache
and
must
be
kent
forgot
himself
so
far
as
to
cough
slightly
behind
his
hand
eyes
sparkled
even
out
here
she
went
on
cuttingly
there
must
be
some
men
who
are
gentlemen
kent
refrained
from
looking
at
her
but
the
blood
crept
darkly
into
his
tanned
cheeks
evidently
she
had
it
in
for
him
but
he
could
not
see
why
he
wondered
swiftly
if
she
blamed
him
for
manley
condition
fleetwood
suddenly
sat
up
spilling
the
handkerchief
to
the
floor
when
valeria
essayed
to
push
him
back
he
put
her
hand
gently
away
he
rose
and
came
over
to
kent
is
this
straight
goods
he
demanded
why
do
you
stop
it
fred
de
garmo
running
this
show
my
influence
would
go
as
far
fleetwood
turned
to
the
girl
and
his
manner
was
masterful
i
going
out
with
kent
oh
val
this
is
burnett
kent
miss
peyson
i
forgot
you
two
are
from
valeria
manner
they
were
in
no
danger
of
becoming
friends
her
acknowledgment
was
barely
perceptible
kent
bowed
stiffly
i
going
to
see
about
this
val
continued
fleetwood
oh
my
better
a
lot
better
really
maybe
we
better
leave
town
if
your
head
is
better
i
do
see
why
we
need
run
away
from
a
lot
of
silly
noise
valeria
interposed
with
merciless
logic
they
think
we
awful
well
i
try
and
find
out
i
wo
be
gone
a
minute
after
that
word
spoken
before
another
he
appeared
to
be
in
great
haste
and
pushed
kent
rather
unceremoniously
through
the
door
in
the
dining
room
kent
diplomatically
included
the
landlady
in
the
conference
by
a
gesture
of
much
mystery
bringing
her
in
from
the
kitchen
where
she
had
been
curiously
peeping
out
at
them
got
to
let
her
in
he
whispered
to
manley
to
keep
her
face
they
murmured
together
for
five
minutes
kent
seemed
to
meet
with
some
opposition
from
fleetwood
an
aftermath
of
valeria
objections
to
flight
and
became
brutally
direct
go
ahead
do
as
you
please
he
said
roughly
but
you
know
that
bunch
you
have
to
show
up
and
you
have
to
set
up
and
aw
thunder
by
morning
you
be
plumb
laid
out
you
be
headed
into
one
of
your
jags
and
you
know
it
i
was
thinking
of
the
girl
but
if
you
do
care
i
guess
it
none
of
my
funeral
go
to
it
but
darned
if
want
to
start
my
honeymoon
out
like
that
fleetwood
weakened
but
still
he
hesitated
if
i
did
show
up
he
began
hopefully
but
kent
wittered
him
with
a
look
that
bunch
will
be
full
before
they
start
out
if
you
show
up
they
go
up
and
haul
you
outa
bed
hell
man
you
likely
start
in
to
kill
somebody
off
fred
de
garmo
do
love
you
much
better
than
he
loves
me
you
know
what
him
and
his
friends
would
do
then
i
should
he
stopped
and
seemed
to
consider
briefly
a
plan
but
shook
his
head
over
it
i
could
round
up
a
bunch
and
stand
off
maybe
but
we
be
shooting
each
other
up
first
rattle
of
the
box
it
a
whole
lot
easier
for
you
to
get
outa
i
tell
somebody

arline
in
a
very
loud
whisper
that

in
front

can
keep
a
light
going
and
pass
back
forth
once
in
a
while

a
while
before

back
i
could
get
the
team

without
giving
the
whole
deal

kent
objected

to
go

fleetwood
stated
as
if
that
settled
the
matter
damn
it
she
got
to
ride
snapped
kent
losing
patience
unless
you
want
to
stay
and
go
on
a
toot
that
last
a
week
most
val
belongs
to
the
shrugged
fleetwood
she
never
well

a
fight
on
your
hands
you
maybe
ca
handle
i
do
see
any
sense
in
haggling
about
going
now
you
know
what
to
expect
but
of
course
he
added
with
some
acrimony
it
your
own
business
i
do
know
what
the
dickens
i
getting
all
worked
up
over
it
for

he
turned
toward
the
door
she
could
ride
my
mollie
and
i
got
a
sidesaddle
hanging
up
in
the
coal
shed
she
could
use
that
or

but
i
explain
as
well
as
i
can
without
say
you
stay
and
see
us
married
wo
you

at
seven
and
kent
fingers
curled
around
the
doorknob
no
thanks
weddings
and
funerals
are
two
bunches
of
trouble
i
always
ride
around
time
enough
when
you
got
to
be
along
about
nine
you
try
and
get
out
to
the
stockyards
without
letting
the
whole
town
see
you
go
and
i
have
the
horses
there
just
beyond
the
wings
by
that
pile
of
ties
you
know
the
place
i
wait
there
till
ten
and
not
a
minute
longer
that
give
you
an
hour
and
you
wo
need
any
more
time
than
that
if
you
get
down
to
business
you
find
out
from
her
what
saddle
she
wants
and
you
can
tell
me
while
i
eating
supper

i
to
the
he
did
not
wait
to
hear
whether
they
agreed
to
the
plan
but
went
moodily
down
the
narrow
passage
and
entered
frowningly
the
several
men
were
gathered
there
waiting
the
supper
summons
hawley
glanced
up
from
wiping
a
glass
and
grinned
well
did
you
git
the
pie
naw
she
said
i
got
to
wait
for
mealtime
she
plumb
chased
me
fred
de
garmo
sprawled
in
an
armchair
and
smoking
a
cigar
lazily
fanned
the
smoke

from
before
his
face
and
looked
at
kent
attentively
chapter
iii
a
lady
in
a
temper
to
saddle
two
horses
when
the
night
has
grown
black
and
to
lead
them
unobserved
so
short
a
distance
as
two
hundred
yards
or
so
seems
a
simple
thing
and
for
two
healthy
young
people
with
full
use
of
their
wits
and
their
legs
to
steal
quietly
away
to
where
those
horses
are
waiting
would
seem
quite
as
simple
at
the
same
time
to
prevent
the
successful
accomplishment
of
these
things
is
not
difficult
if
one
but
fully
understands
the
designs
of
the
fugitives
hawley
hotel
did
a
flourishing
business
that
night
the
two
long
tables
in
the
dining
room
usually
not
more
than
half
filled
by
those
who
hungered
and
were
not
concerning
the
food
they
ate
were
twice
filled
to
overflowing
hawley
and
the
breed
girl
held
hasty
consultations
in
the
kitchen
over
the
supply
and
never
was
there
such
a
rattling
of
dishes
hurriedly
cleansed
for
the
next
comer
kent
managed
to
find
a
chair
at
the
first
table
and
eyed
the
landlady
unobtrusively
but
fred
de
garmo
sat
down
opposite
and
his
eyes
were
bright
and
watchful
so
that
there
seemed
no
possible
way
of
delivering
a
message
undetected
until
indeed
hawley
in
desperation
resorted
to
strategy
and
urged
kent
unnecessarily
to
take
another
slice
of
bacon
have
some
more
it
she
hissed
in
his
ear
and
watched
anxiously
his
face
all
right
said
kent
and
speared
a
slice
with
his
fork
although
his
plate
was
already
well
supplied
with
bacon
then
glancing
up
he
detected
fred
in
a
thoughtful
stare
which
seemed
evenly
divided
between
the
landlady
and
himself
kent
was
conscious
of
a
passing
mental
discomfort
which
he
put
aside
as
foolish
because
de
garmo
could
not
possibly
know
what
hawley
meant
to
ease
his
mind
still
further
he
glared
insolently
at
fred
and
then
at
polycarp
jenks
a
few
chairs
away
after
that
he
finished
as
quickly
as
possible
without
exciting
remark
and
went
his
way
he
had
not
however
been
two
minutes
in
the
office
before
de
garmo
entered
from
that
time
on
through
the
whole
evening
fred
was
never
far
distant
wherever
he
went
kent
could
not
shake
him
off
though
de
garmo
never
seemed
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
and
his
presence
was
always
apparently
accidental
i
reckon
i
have
to
lick
that
son
of
a
gun
yet
sighed
kent
when
a
glance
at
the
round
clock
in
the
hotel
office
told
him
that
in
just
twenty
minutes
it
would
strike
nine
and
not
a
move
made
toward
getting
those
horses
saddled
and
out
to
the
stockyards
there
was
much
talk
of
the
wedding
which
had
taken
place
quietly
in
the
parlor
at
the
appointed
hour
but
not
a
man
mentioned
a
there
were
many
who
wished
openly
that
fleetwood
would
come
out
and
be
sociable
about
it
but
not
a
hint
that
they
intended
to
take
measures
to
bring
him
among
them
he
had
caused
a
box
of
cigars
to
be
placed
upon
the
bar
of
every
saloon
in
town
where
men
might
help
themselves
at
his
expense
evidently
he
had
considered
that
with
the
cigars
his
social
obligations
were
canceled
they
smoked
the
cigars
and
with
the
same
breath
gossiped
of
him
and
his
affairs
at
just
fourteen
minutes
to
nine
kent
went
out
and
without
any
attempt
at
concealment
hurried
to
the
hawley
stables
half
a
minute
behind
him
trailed
de
garmo
also
without
subterfuge
half
an
hour
later
the
bridal
couple
stole
away
from
the
rear
of
the
hotel
and
keeping
to
the
shadows
went
stumbling
over
the
uneven
ground
to
the
stockyards
here
the
tie
pile
fleetwood
announced
in
an
undertone
when
they
reached
the
place
you
stay
here
val
and
i
look
farther
along
the
fence
maybe
the
horses
are
down
valeria
did
not
reply
but
stood
very
straight
and
dignified
in
the
shadow
of
the
huge
pile
of
rotting
railroad
ties
he
was
gone
but
a
moment
and
came
anxiously
back
to
her
they
not
here
he
said
in
a
low
voice
do
worry
dear
come
i
know
kent
are
you
sure
queried
val
sweetly
from
what
i
have
seen
of
the
gentleman
your
high
estimate
of
him
seems
quite
unauthorized
aside
from
escorting
me
to
the
hotel
he
has
been
anything
but
reliable
instead
of
telling
you
that
i
was
here
or
telling
me
that
you
were
sick
he
went
straight
into
a
saloon
and
forgot
all
about
us
both
you
know
that
if
he
were
your
friend
why
should
he
immediately
begin
carousing
instead
of
he
did
fleetwood
defended
weakly
no
then
perhaps
you
can
explain
his
behavior
why
did
he
tell
me
you
were
sick
why
did
he
tell
you
i
came
on
that
train
can
you
tell
me
that
manley
manley
for
a
very
good
reason
could
not
so
he
put
his
arms
around
her
and
tried
to
coax
her
into
good
humor
sweetheart
let
not
quarrel
so
soon
why
we
only
two
hours
married
i
want
you
to
be
happy
and
if
you
only
be
brave
and
brave
fleetwood
laughed
rather
contemptuously
for
a
bride
please
to
understand
manley
that
i
not
frightened
in
the
least
it
you
and
that
horrid
cowboy
do
see
why
we
need
run
away
like
criminals
those
men
do
intend
to
us
do
they
her
mood
softened
a
little
and
she
squeezed
his
arm
between
her
hands
you
dear
old
silly
i
not
blaming
with
your
head
in
such
a
state
you
ca
think
things
out
properly
and
you
let
that
cowboy
influence
you
against
your
better
judgment
you
afraid
i
might
be
annoyed
but
really
manley
this
silly
idea
of
running
away
annoys
me
much
more
than
all
the
noise
those
fellows
could
possibly
make
indeed
i
do
think
i
would
mind
it
would
give
me
a
glimpse
of
the
real
west
and
perhaps
if
they
grew
too
boisterous
and
i
spoke
to
them
and
asked
them
not
to
be
quite
so
rough
and
really
they
only
mean
it
as
a
sort
of
welcome
in
their
crude
way
we
could
invite
some
of
the
nicest
in
to
have
cake
and
coffee
or
maybe
we
might
get
some
ice
cream
somewhere
and
it
might
turn
out
a
very
pleasant
little
affair
i
do
mind
meeting
them
manley
the
worst
of
them
ca
be
as
bad
as
that
but
of
course
if
he
your
friend
i
suppose
i
ought
to
speak
too
freely
my
opinion
of
him
fleetwood
held
her
closely
patted
her
cheek
absently
and
tried
to
think
of
some
effective
argument
they
be
drunk
sweetheart
he
told
her
after
a
silence
i
do
think
so
she
returned
firmly
i
have
been
watching
the
street
all
the
evening
i
saw
any
number
of
men
passing
back
and
forth
and
i
did
see
one
who
staggered
and
they
were
all
very
quiet
considering
their
rough
ways
which
one
must
expect
why
manley
you
always
wrote
about
these
western
men
being
such
fine
fellows
and
so
generous
and
under
their
rough
exterior
your
letters
were
full
of
it
and
how
chivalrous
they
all
are
toward
nice
she
laid
her
head
coaxingly
against
his
shoulder
let
go
back
manley
i
to
see
a
dear
it
will
be
fun
i
want
to
write
all
about
it
to
the
girls
they
be
perfectly
wild
with
she
struggled
with
her
conventional
upbringing
and
even
if
some
of
them
are
slightly
under
the
influence
of
liquor
we
need
them
you
introduce
those
at
all
and
i
sure
they
will
do
be
silly
val
fleetwood
did
not
mean
to
be
rude
but
a
faint
glimmer
of
her
romantic
viewpoint
a
viewpoint
gained
chiefly
from
current
fiction
and
the
stage
came
to
him
and
contrasted
rather
brutally
with
the
reality
he
did
not
know
how
to
make
her
understand
without
incriminating
himself
his
letters
had
been
rather
idealistic
he
admitted
to
himself
they
had
been
written
unthinkingly
because
he
wanted
her
to
like
this
big
land
naturally
he
had
not
been
too
baldly
truthful
in
picturing
the
place
and
the
people
he
had
passed
lightly
over
their
faults
and
thrown
the
limelight
on
their
virtues
and
so
he
had
aided
unwittingly
the
stage
and
the
fiction
she
had
read
in
giving
her
a
false
impression
offended
at
his
words
and
his
tone
she
drew
away
from
him
and
glanced
wistfully
back
toward
the
town
as
if
she
meditated
a
haughty
return
to
the
hotel
she
ended
by
seating
herself
upon
a
projecting
tie
oh
very
well
my
lord
she
retorted
i
shall
try
and
not
be
silly
but
merely
idiotic
as
you
would
have
me
you
and
your
friend
she
was
very
angry
but
she
was
perfectly
she
hoped
if
i
might
venture
a
word
she
began
again
ironically
it
seems
to
me
that
your
friend
has
been
playing
a
practical
joke
upon
you
he
evidently
has
no
intention
of
bringing
any
fleet
steeds
to
us
no
doubt
he
is
at
this
moment
laughing
with
his
dissolute
companions
because
we
are
sitting
out
here
in
the
dark
like
two
silly
chickens
i
think
he
coming
now
manley
said
rather
stiffly
of
course
i
ask
you
to
like
him
but
he
putting
himself
to
a
good
deal
of
trouble
for
us
and
wasted
effort
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
valeria
put
in
with
a
chirpy
accent
which
was
exasperating
even
to
a
bridegroom
very
much
in
love
with
his
bride
in
the
darkness
that
muffled
the
land
save
where
the
yellow
flare
of
lamps
in
the
little
town
made
a
misty
brightness
came
the
click
of
shod
hoofs
another
moment
and
a
man
mounted
upon
a
white
horse
loomed
indistinct
before
them
seeming
to
take
substance
from
the
night
behind
him
trailed
another
horse
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
valeria
heard
the
soft
whispering
creak
of
saddle
leather
the
faint
clank
of
spur
chains
and
the
whir
of
a
horse
mouthing
the
cricket
in
his
bit
even
in
her
anger
she
was
conscious
of
an
answering
tingle
of
blood
because
this
was
life
in
the
raw
life
such
as
she
had
dreamed
of
in
the
tight
swaddlings
of
a
smug
civilization
and
had
longed
for
intensely
kent
swung
down
close
beside
them
his
form
indistinct
but
purposeful
late
i
guess
he
remarked
turning
to
fleetwood
fred
got
next
somehow
and
i
was
where
is
he
asked
manley
going
up
and
laying
a
questioning
hand
upon
the
horse
by
that
means
fully
recognizing
it
as
kent
own
in
the
oats
box
said
kent
laconically
he
turned
to
the
girl
i
could
get
the
sidesaddle
he
explained
apologetically
i
looked
where
hawley
said
it
was
but
i
could
find
it
and
i
did
have
much
time
you
have
to
ride
a
stock
valeria
drew
back
a
step
you
mean
a
man
saddle
her
voice
was
carefully
polite
why
and
he
added
the
horse
is
dead
gentle
and
a
sidesaddle
no
good
anyhow
you
like
this
he
spoke
as
was
evident
purely
from
a
man
viewpoint
that
viewpoint
fleetwood
refused
to
share
oh
i
could
ride
a
man
saddle
she
protested
still
politely
and
one
could
imagine
how
her
lips
were
pursed
indeed
i
not
sure
that
i
care
to
leave
town
at
to
her
the
declaration
did
not
seem
unreasonable
or
abrupt
but
she
felt
that
kent
was
very
much
shocked
she
saw
him
turn
his
head
and
look
back
toward
the
town
as
if
he
half
expected
a
pursuit
i
do
reckon
the
oats
box
will
hold
fred
very
long
he
observed
meditatively
he
added
reminiscently
to
manley
i
had
a
deuce
of
a
time
getting
the
cover
down
and
i
very
sorry
said
valeria
with
sweet
dignity
that
you
gave
yourself
so
much
trouble
i
kinda
sorry
myself
kent
agreed
mildly
and
valeria
blushed
hotly
and
was
glad
he
could
not
see
come
val
you
can
ride
this
saddle
all
right
all
the
girls
out
here
i
did
not
come
west
to
imitate
all
the
girls
indeed
i
could
never
think
of
such
a
thing
i
could
possibly
really
manley
and
you
know
it
does
seem
so
childish
of
us
to
run
away
kent
moved
restlessly
and
felt
to
see
if
the
cinch
was
tight
fleetwood
took
her
coaxingly
by
the
arm
come
sweetheart
do
be
stubborn
you
know
well
really
if
it
a
question
of
obstinacy
you
see
i
look
at
the
matter
in
this
way
you
believe
that
you
are
doing
what
is
best
for
my
sake
i
do
agree
with
you
and
it
does
seem
as
if
i
should
be
permitted
to
judge
what
i
then
her
dignity
and
her
sweet
calm
went
down
before
a
flash
of
real
unpolished
temper
you
two
can
take
those
nasty
horses
and
ride
clear
to
dakota
if
you
want
to
i
going
back
to
the
hotel
and
i
going
to
tell
somebody
to
let
that
poor
fellow
out
of
that
box
i
think
you
acting
perfectly
horrid
both
of
you
when
i
do
want
to
go
she
actually
started
back
toward
the
scattered
points
of
light
she
did
not
however
get
so
faraway
that
she
failed
to
hear
kent
well
i
be
damned
uttered
in
a
tone
of
intense
disgust
i
do
care
she
assured
herself
because
of
the
thrill
of
compunction
caused
by
that
one
forcible
sentence
she
had
never
before
in
her
life
heard
a
man
really
swear
it
affected
her
very
much
as
would
the
accidental
touch
of
an
electric
battery
she
walked
on
slowly
stumbling
a
little
and
trying
to
hear
what
it
was
they
were
saying
then
kent
passed
her
loping
back
to
the
town
the
led
horse
shaking
his
saddle
so
that
it
rattled
the
stirrups
like
castanets
as
he
galloped
i
do
care
she
told
herself
again
very
emphatically
because
she
was
quite
sure
that
she
did
care
or
that
she
would
care
if
only
she
permitted
herself
to
be
so
foolish
manley
overtook
her
then
and
drew
her
hand
under
his
arm
to
lead
her
but
he
seemed
quite
sullen
and
would
not
say
a
word
all
the
way
back
chapter
iv
the
shivaree
kent
jerked
open
the
stable
door
led
in
his
horses
turned
them
into
their
stalls
and
removed
the
saddles
with
quick
nervous
movements
which
told
plainly
how
angry
he
was
i
get
myself
all
excited
trying
to
do
her
a
favor
again
i
think
he
growled
in
the
ear
of
michael
his
gray
gelding
think
of
me
getting
let
down
on
my
face
like
that
by
a
woman
he
felt
along
the
wall
in
the
intense
darkness
until
his
fingers
touched
a
lantern
took
it
down
from
the
nail
where
it
hung
and
lighted
it
he
carried
it
farther
down
the
rude
passage
between
the
stalls
hung
it
high
upon
another
nail
and
turned
to
the
great
oats
box
from
within
which
came
a
vigorous
thumping
and
the
sound
of
muttered
cursing
kent
was
not
in
the
mood
to
see
the
humor
of
anything
in
particular
had
he
known
anything
about
pandora
box
he
might
have
drawn
a
comparison
very
neatly
while
he
stood
scowling
down
at
the
oats
box
for
certainly
he
was
likely
to
release
trouble
in
plenty
when
he
unfastened
that
lid
he
felt
of
the
gun
swinging
at
his
hip
just
to
assure
himself
that
it
was
there
and
ready
for
business
in
case
fred
wanted
to
shoot
and
rapped
with
his
knuckles
upon
the
box
producing
instant
silence
within
do
make
so
much
noise
in
there
he
advised
grimly
not
unless
you
want
the
whole
town
to
know
where
you
are
and
have
give
you
the
laugh
and
listen
here
i
ai
apologizing
for
what
i
done
but
all
the
same
i
sorry
i
did
it
it
was
any
use
i
rather
be
shut
up
in
an
oats
box
all
night
than
get
let
down
like
i
was
and
i
telling
you
this
so
as
to
start
us
off
even
if
you
want
to
fight
about
it
when
you
come
out
all
right
you
the
doctor
but
i
just
as
sorry
as
you
are
it
happened
i
lay
down
my
hand
right
here
i
hope
you
shivaree
man
and
his
wife
and
shivaree
good
i
hope
you
bust
the
town
wide
why
this
sudden
change
of
heart
came
muffled
from
within
ah
that
my
own
business
well
i
do
like
you
a
little
bit
and
you
know
it
but
i
tell
you
just
to
give
you
a
fair
show
i
wanted
to
keep
man
sober
and
i
tried
to
get
him
and
his
wife
out
of
town
before
that
shivaree
of
yours
was
pulled
off
but
the
lady
would
have
it
that
way
i
got
let
right
down
on
my
face
and
i
done
now
you
know
just
where
i
stand
maybe
i
a
fool
for
telling
you
but
i
seem
to
be
in
the
business
come
on
he
unfastened
the
big
iron
hasp
which
was
showing
signs
of
the
strain
put
upon
it
and
stepped
back
watchfully
the
thick
oaken
lid
was
pushed
up
and
fred
de
garmo
rather
dusty
and
disheveled
and
purple
from
the
close
atmosphere
of
the
box
and
from
anger
as
well
came
up
like
a
and
glared
at
kent
when
he
had
stepped
out
upon
the
stable
floor
however
he
smiled
rather
unpleasantly
illustration
he
was
jeered
unmercifully
by
fred
de
garmo
and
his
crowd
if
you
told
the
truth
he
said
maliciously
i
guess
the
lady
has
pretty
near
evened
things
up
if
you
have
if
i
do
find
them
both
at
the
hotel
well
anyway
he
added
with
an
ominous
inflection
be
other
days
to
settle
this
in
why
sure
help
yourself
fred
kent
retorted
cheerfully
and
stood
where
he
was
until
fred
had
gone
out
then
he
turned
and
closed
the
box
between
that
dame
and
the
chump
that
went
and
left
this
box
wide
open
for
me
to
tip
fred
into
he
soliloquized
while
he
took
down
the
lantern
and
so
sent
the
shadows
dancing
weirdly
about
him
i
got
a
bunch
of
trouble
mixed
up
for
fair
i
wish
the
son
of
a
gun
would
fight
it
out
now
and
be
done
with
it
but
no
that
ai
fred
he
a
heap
rather
wait
and
let
it
draw
interest
over
in
the
hotel
the
dame
was
doing
her
unsophisticated
best
to
meet
the
situation
gracefully
and
to
realize
certain
vague
and
rather
romantic
dreams
of
her
life
out
west
she
meant
to
be
very
gracious
for
one
thing
and
to
win
the
chivalrous
friendship
of
every
man
who
came
to
participate
in
the
rude
congratulations
that
had
been
planned
just
how
she
meant
to
do
this
she
did
not
know
except
that
the
graciousness
would
certainly
prove
a
very
important
factor
i
going
to
remain
downstairs
she
told
manley
when
they
reached
the
hotel
it
was
the
first
sentence
she
had
spoken
since
he
overtook
her
so
glad
dear
she
added
diplomatically
that
you
decided
to
stay
i
want
to
see
that
funny
landlady
now
please
and
get
her
to
serve
coffee
and
cake
to
our
guests
in
the
parlor
i
wish
i
might
have
had
one
of
my
trunks
brought
over
here
i
should
like
to
wear
a
pretty
she
glanced
down
at
her
tailored
suit
with
true
feminine
dissatisfaction
but
everything
was
so
so
confused
with
your
being
late
and
sick
is
your
head
better
dear
manley
in
very
few
words
assured
her
that
it
was
manley
was
struggling
with
his
inner
self
trying
to
answer
one
very
important
question
and
to
answer
it
truthfully
could
he
meet
the
boys
do
his
part
among
them
and
still
remain
sober
that
seemed
to
be
the
only
course
open
to
him
now
and
he
knew
himself
just
well
enough
to
doubt
his
own
strength
but
if
kent
would
help
him
he
felt
an
immediate
necessity
to
find
kent
you
find
hawley
somewhere
around
he
said
hurriedly
i
got
to
see
kent
oh
manley
do
have
anything
to
do
with
that
horrid
cowboy
not
nice
he
he
swore
when
he
must
have
known
i
could
hear
him
and
he
was
swearing
about
manley
did
you
hear
him
she
stood
in
the
doorway
and
clung
to
his
arm
no
lied
manley
you
must
have
been
mistaken
oh
i
was
i
heard
him
quite
she
must
have
thought
it
a
terrible
thing
for
she
almost
whispered
the
last
words
and
she
released
him
with
much
reluctance
it
seemed
to
her
that
manley
was
in
danger
of
falling
among
low
associates
and
that
she
must
protect
him
in
spite
of
himself
it
failed
to
occur
to
her
that
manley
had
been
exposed
to
that
danger
for
three
years
without
any
protection
whatever
she
was
thankful
when
he
came
to
her
later
in
the
parlor
to
learn
from
him
that
he
had
not
held
any
speech
with
kent
that
was
some
comfort
and
she
felt
that
she
needed
a
little
comforting
just
then
her
consultation
with
arline
had
been
rather
unsatisfactory
arline
had
told
her
bluntly
that
the
bunch
did
want
any
coffee
and
cake
whisky
and
cigars
said
arline
without
so
much
as
a
blush
was
what
appealed
to
them
fellows
if
manley
handed
it
out
liberal
enough
they
would
bother
his
bride
very
likely
arline
had
assured
her
she
would
see
one
of
them
that
on
the
whole
had
been
rather
discouraging
how
was
she
to
show
herself
a
gracious
lady
forsooth
if
no
one
came
near
her
but
she
kept
these
things
jealously
tucked
away
in
the
remotest
corner
of
her
own
mind
and
managed
to
look
the
relief
she
did
not
feel
and
after
all
the
as
is
apt
to
be
the
case
when
the
plans
are
laid
so
carefully
proved
a
very
tame
affair
valeria
sitting
rather
dismally
in
the
parlor
with
hawley
for
company
at
midnight
heard
a
banging
of
tin
cans
somewhere
outside
a
fitful
popping
of
and
an
abortive
attempt
at
a
procession
coming
up
the
street
but
the
lines
seemed
to
waver
and
then
break
utterly
at
the
first
saloon
where
drink
was
to
be
had
for
the
asking
and
manley
fleetwood
was
pledged
to
pay
and
the
rattle
of
cans
was
all
but
drowned
in
the
shouts
of
laughter
and
talk
which
came
from
the
office
across
the
hall
for
where
is
the
pleasure
or
the
profit
in
a
bridal
couple
which
stays
up
and
waits
quite
openly
for
the
clamor
is
it
always
so
noisy
here
at
night
asked
valeria
faintly
when
hawley
had
insisted
upon
her
lying
down
upon
the
uncomfortable
sofa
well
no
unless
a
pulls
in
or
there
a
dance
or
christmas
or
something
it
liable
to
keep
up
till
two
or
three
so
the
sooner
you
git
used
to
it
the
better
off
you
be
i
going
to
leave
you
here
and
go
to
bed
unless
you
want
to
go
upstairs
yourself
only
it
be
noisier
than
ever
up
in
your
room
for
it
right
over
the
office
and
the
way
sound
travels
up
is
something
fierce
do
you
be
afraid
i
lock
this
door
and
if
your
husband
wants
to
come
in
he
can
come
through
the
dining
she
looked
at
valeria
and
hesitated
before
she
spoke
the
next
sentence
and
do
you
worry
a
bit
over
him
neither
my
old
man
was
in
the
kitchen
a
minute
ago
when
i
was
out
there
and
he
says
man
ai
drinking
a
drop
he
keeping
as
straight
as
valeria
sat
up
suddenly
quite
scandalized
oh
why
of
course
manley
would
drink
with
them
why
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
the
idea
she
stared
reproachfully
at
her
hostess
oh
sure
i
did
say
such
a
thing
was
liable
to
happen
i
just
thought
you
might
be
worrying
they
making
so
much
racket
in
there
stammered
arline
indeed
no
i
not
at
all
worried
thank
you
and
please
do
let
me
keep
you
up
any
longer
hawley
i
am
quite
comfortable
mentally
and
physically
i
assure
you
good
not
even
hawley
could
remain
after
that
she
went
out
and
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
her
without
even
finding
voice
enough
to
return
valeria
sweetly
modulated
good
night
she
got
a
whole
lot
to
learn
she
relieved
her
feelings
somewhat
by
muttering
as
she
mounted
the
stairs
what
it
cost
manley
fleetwood
to
abstain
absolutely
and
without
even
the
compromise
of
soft
drinks
that
night
who
can
say
three
years
of
free
living
in
montana
had
lowered
his
standard
of
morality
without
giving
him
that
rugged
strength
of
mind
which
makes
a
man
master
of
himself
first
of
all
he
had
that
day
lain
drunken
and
sleeping
when
he
should
have
been
at
his
mental
and
physical
best
to
meet
the
girl
who
would
marry
him
it
was
that
very
defection
perhaps
which
kept
him
sober
in
the
midst
of
his
taunting
fellows
now
that
valeria
was
actually
here
and
was
his
wife
he
was
possessed
by
the
desire
to
make
some
sacrifice
by
which
he
might
prove
his
penitence
at
any
cost
he
would
spare
her
pain
and
humiliation
he
told
himself
he
did
it
and
he
did
it
under
difficulty
he
was
denied
the
moral
support
of
kent
burnett
for
kent
was
sulking
over
his
slight
and
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
he
was
jeered
unmercifully
by
fred
de
garmo
and
his
crowd
he
was
baptized
by
some
drunken
reveler
so
that
the
stench
of
spilled
whisky
filled
his
nostrils
and
tortured
him
the
night
through
he
was
urged
he
was
bullied
he
was
ridiculed
his
head
throbbed
his
eyeballs
burned
but
through
it
all
he
stayed
among
them
because
he
feared
that
if
he
left
them
and
went
to
val
some
drunken
fool
might
follow
him
and
shock
her
with
his
inebriety
he
stayed
and
he
stayed
sober
val
was
his
wife
she
trusted
him
and
she
was
ignorant
of
his
sins
if
he
went
to
her
staggering
and
babbling
incoherent
foolishness
he
knew
it
would
break
her
heart
when
the
sky
was
at
last
showing
faint
dawn
tints
and
the
clamor
had
worn
itself
out
perforce
because
even
the
leaders
were
after
all
but
men
and
there
was
a
limit
to
their
endurance
manley
entered
the
parlor
haggard
enough
it
is
true
and
bearing
with
him
the
stale
odor
of
cigars
long
since
smoked
and
of
the
baptism
of
bad
whisky
but
also
with
the
air
of
conscious
rectitude
which
sits
so
comically
upon
a
man
unused
to
the
feeling
of
virtue
as
is
so
often
the
case
when
one
fights
alone
the
good
fight
and
manages
to
win
he
was
chagrined
to
find
himself
immediately
put
upon
the
defensive
val
as
she
speedily
demonstrated
declined
to
look
upon
him
as
a
hero
or
as
being
particularly
virtuous
she
considered
herself
rather
neglected
and
abused
she
believed
that
he
had
stayed
away
because
he
was
angry
with
her
on
account
of
her
refusal
to
leave
town
and
she
thought
that
was
rather
brutal
of
him
also
her
head
ached
from
tears
and
lack
of
sleep
and
she
hated
the
town
the
hotel
almost
she
hated
manley
himself
manley
felt
the
rebuff
of
her
chilling
silence
when
he
came
in
and
when
she
twitched
herself
loose
from
his
embrace
he
came
near
regretting
his
extreme
virtue
he
spent
ten
minutes
trying
to
explain
without
telling
all
of
the
truth
and
he
felt
his
good
opinion
of
himself
slipping
from
him
before
her
inexorable
disfavor
well
i
do
blame
you
for
not
liking
the
town
val
he
said
at
last
rather
desperately
but
you
must
judge
the
whole
country
by
it
like
the
ranch
dear
you
feel
as
if
you
were
in
another
world
i
hope
so
val
interrupted
quellingly
we
drive
out
there
just
as
soon
as
we
have
he
laid
his
hand
diffidently
upon
her
tumbled
hair
i
to
stay
out
there
with
those
fellows
i
did
want
to
i
do
want
any
breakfast
said
val
getting
up
and
going
over
to
the
window
it
would
seem
to
avoid
his
caress
the
odor
of
that
dining
room
is
enough
to
make
one
fast
she
lifted
the
grimy
lace
curtain
with
her
finger
tips
and
looked
disconsolately
out
upon
the
street
it
just
a
dirty
squalid
little
hamlet
i
do
suppose
the
streets
have
been
cleaned
or
the
garbage
removed
from
the
back
yards
since
the
place
was
first
she
laughed
shortly
at
the
idea
of
founding
a
wretched
village
like
that
but
she
had
no
other
word
at
hand
she
remarked
in
a
tone
of
drawling
recklessness
arline
swears
did
you
know
it
i
suppose
of
course
you
do
she
said
something
that
struck
me
as
being
shockingly
true
she
said
i
having
a
hell
of
a
honeymoon
then
she
bit
her
lips
hard
because
her
eyelids
were
stinging
with
the
tears
she
refused
to
shed
in
his
presence
oh
val
from
the
sofa
manley
stared
contritely
at
her
back
she
must
feel
terrible
he
thought
to
bring
herself
to
repeat
that
sentence
val
so
icily
pure
in
her
thoughts
and
her
speech
val
was
blinking
her
tawny
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
a
lion
in
color
at
the
street
not
for
the
world
would
she
let
him
see
that
she
wanted
to
cry
a
figure
blurred
to
indistinctness
appealed
in
a
doorway
nearly
opposite
stood
for
a
moment
looking
up
at
the
reddened
sky
and
came
across
the
street
as
the
tears
were
beaten
back
she
saw
and
recognized
him
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
here
comes
your
cowboy
friend
from
a
saloon
of
her
voice
was
lazily
contemptuous
only
his
presence
in
the
street
was
needed
to
complete
the
picture
of
desolation
he
has
been
in
a
fight
judging
from
his
face
it
is
all
bruised
and
skinned
and
one
eye
is
swollen
ugh
my
guide
my
adviser
is
it
possible
manley
that
you
could
find
a
man
to
meet
me
at
the
train
she
turned
from
the
disagreeable
sight
of
kent
and
faced
her
husband
are
all
the
men
like
that
and
are
all
the
women
like
arline
manley
looked
at
her
dumbly
from
the
sofa
would
val
ever
come
to
understand
the
place
and
the
people
he
was
wondering
she
laughed
suddenly
i
beginning
to
feel
very
sorry
for
walt
she
said
irrelevantly
pointing
to
the
easel
and
the
expressionless
crayon
portrait
staring
out
from
the
gilt
frame
he
has
to
stay
in
this
room
always
and
i
believe
another
two
hours
would
drive
me
hopelessly
the
word
caught
her
attention
hope
she
laughed
ironically
what
imbecile
ever
thought
of
hope
in
the
same
breath
with
this
place
what
they
really
ought
to
do
is
paint
that
admonition
across
the
whole
front
of
the
depot
manley
because
he
had
lifted
his
head
too
suddenly
and
so
sent
irons
of
pain
clashing
through
his
brain
turned
sullen
if
you
hate
it
as
bad
as
all
that
he
said
why
there
be
a
train
for
the
east
in
about
two
val
stiffened
perceptibly
though
the
petulance
in
her
face
changed
to
something
wistful
do
you
mean
do
you
want
me
to
go
she
asked
very
calmly
manley
pressed
his
fingers
hard
against
his
temples
you
know
i
do
i
want
you
to
stay
and
like
the
country
and
be
happy
but
the
way
you
have
been
talking
makes
it
seem
he
dropped
his
tortured
head
upon
his
hands
and
did
not
trouble
to
finish
what
he
had
intended
to
say
nervous
strain
lack
of
sleep
and
a
headache
to
begin
with
were
taking
heavy
toll
of
him
he
could
not
argue
with
her
he
could
not
do
anything
except
wish
he
were
dead
or
that
his
head
would
stop
aching
val
took
one
of
her
unexpected
changes
of
mood
she
went
up
and
laid
her
cold
fingers
lightly
upon
his
temples
where
she
could
see
the
blood
beating
savagely
in
the
swollen
veins
what
a
little
beast
i
am
she
murmured
contritely
shall
i
get
you
some
coffee
dear
or
some
headache
tablets
or
you
know
a
cold
cloth
helped
you
last
evening
lie
down
for
a
little
while
there
no
hurry
about
starting
is
there
i
i
do
hate
the
place
so
awfully
manley
i
just
cross
because
i
could
sleep
for
the
noise
here
a
cushion
dear
i
think
it
stuffed
with
scrap
iron
for
there
does
seem
to
be
anything
soft
about
it
except
the
invitation
to
sweetly
in
red
and
green
silk
but
anything
is
better
than
the
head
of
that
sofa
in
its
natural
she
arranged
the
cushion
to
her
own
liking
if
not
to
his
and
when
it
was
done
she
bent
down
impulsively
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
blushing
vividly
the
while
i
wo
be
nasty
and
cross
any
more
she
promised
now
i
going
to
interview
arline
i
hear
dishes
rattling
somewhere
perhaps
i
can
get
a
cup
of
real
coffee
for
at
the
door
she
shook
her
finger
at
him
playfully
do
you
dare
stir
off
that
sofa
while
i
gone
she
admonished
and
remember
we
not
going
to
leave
town
until
your
head
stops
aching
not
if
we
stay
here
a
week
she
insisted
upon
bringing
him
coffee
and
toast
upon
a
tray
a
battered
old
tray
purloined
for
that
purpose
from
the
saloon
if
she
had
only
known
it
and
she
informed
him
with
a
pretty
domestic
pride
that
she
had
made
the
toast
herself
arline
was
going
to
lay
slices
of
bread
on
top
of
the
stove
she
explained
she
said
she
always
makes
toast
that
way
and
no
one
could
tell
the
difference
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
did
you
manley
but
been
attending
a
cooking
school
ever
since
you
left
fern
hill
i
tell
you
i
wanted
it
for
a
surprise
i
could
have
done
better
with
the
toast
before
a
wood
fire
i
think
poor
arline
was
nearly
distracted
at
the
way
i
poked
coals
down
from
the
grate
but
she
did
say
anything
it
funny
to
have
cream
in
cans
i
do
suppose
it
ever
saw
a
cow
do
you
the
coffee
pretty
bad
is
it
but
wait
until
we
get
home
i
can
make
lovely
coffee
if
you
get
me
a
percolator
you
will
wo
you
and
i
learned
now
to
make
the
most
delicious
fruit
salad
just
before
i
left
a
cousin
of
forman
taught
me
how
could
you
drink
another
cup
dear
manley
could
not
and
she
deplored
the
poor
quality
although
she
generously
absolved
arline
from
blame
because
there
seemed
so
much
to
do
in
that
kitchen
she
refused
to
take
any
breakfast
herself
telling
him
gayly
that
the
odor
in
the
kitchen
was
both
food
and
drink
because
he
understood
a
little
of
her
loathing
for
the
place
manley
lied
heroically
about
his
headache
so
that
within
an
hour
they
were
leaving
town
with
the
two
great
trunks
roped
securely
to
the
buckboard
behind
the
seat
and
with
val
suitcase
placed
flat
in
the
front
where
she
could
rest
her
feet
upon
it
val
was
so
happy
at
the
prospect
of
getting
away
from
the
town
that
she
actually
threw
a
kiss
in
the
direction
of
arline
standing
with
her
frowsy
head
her
apron
and
her
tired
face
in
the
parlor
door
her
mood
changed
immediately
however
for
she
had
no
more
than
turned
from
waving
her
hand
at
arline
when
they
met
kent
riding
slowly
up
the
street
with
his
hat
tilted
over
the
eye
most
swollen
without
a
doubt
he
had
seen
her
waving
and
smiling
and
so
he
must
have
observed
the
instant
cooling
of
her
manner
he
nodded
to
manley
and
lifted
his
hat
while
he
looked
at
her
full
and
val
in
the
arrogant
pride
of
virtuous
young
womanhood
let
her
eyes
dwell
impersonally
upon
his
face
let
her
white
round
chin
dip
half
an
inch
downward
and
then
looked
past
him
as
if
he
were
a
post
by
the
roadside
afterwards
she
smiled
maliciously
when
she
saw
with
a
swift
sidelong
glance
how
he
scowled
and
spurred
unnecessarily
his
gray
gelding
chapter
cold
spring
ranch
for
almost
three
years
the
letters
from
manley
had
been
headed
cold
spring
for
quite
as
long
val
had
possessed
a
mental
picture
of
the
place
a
picture
of
a
gurgly
little
brook
with
rocks
and
watercress
and
distracting
little
pools
the
size
of
a
bathtub
and
with
a
great
frowning
boulder
a
cliff
almost
at
the
head
the
brook
bubbled
out
and
formed
a
basin
in
the
shadow
of
the
rock
around
it
grew
trees
unnamed
in
the
picture
it
is
true
but
trees
nevertheless
below
the
spring
stood
a
picturesque
little
cottage
a
shack
manley
had
written
was
but
a
synonym
for
a
small
cottage
and
val
had
many
small
cottages
in
mind
from
which
she
sketched
one
into
her
picture
the
sun
shone
on
it
and
the
western
breezes
flapped
white
curtains
in
the
windows
and
there
was
a
porch
where
she
would
swing
her
hammock
and
gaze
out
over
the
great
beautiful
country
fascinating
in
its
very
immensity
somewhere
beyond
the
cottage
shack
she
usually
corrected
herself
were
the
corrals
they
were
as
yet
rather
impressionistic
high
round
mysterious
inclosures
forming
an
effective
if
somewhat
hazy
background
to
the
picture
she
left
them
to
work
out
their
attractive
details
upon
closer
acquaintance
for
at
most
they
were
merely
the
background
the
front
yard
however
she
dwelt
upon
and
made
aglow
with
sturdy
flowers
manley
had
that
spring
planted
sweet
peas
and
poppies
and
pansies
and
other
things
he
wrote
her
and
they
had
come
up
very
nicely
afterward
in
a
postscript
he
answered
her
questions
about
the
flower
garden
the
flowers
are
doing
as
well
as
they
might
they
need
your
tender
care
i
do
have
much
time
to
pet
them
along
the
onions
are
doing
pretty
well
but
they
need
weeding
badly
in
spite
of
that
the
flowers
bloomed
luxuriantly
in
her
mental
picture
though
she
conscientiously
remembered
that
they
were
doing
as
well
as
they
might
they
were
weedy
and
unkempt
she
supposed
but
a
little
time
and
care
would
remedy
that
and
was
she
not
coming
to
be
the
mistress
of
all
this
and
to
make
everything
beautiful
besides
the
spring
and
the
brook
which
ran
from
it
and
the
trees
which
shaded
it
were
the
chief
attractions
perhaps
she
betrayed
a
lack
of
domesticity
because
she
had
not
been
able
to
see
the
interior
of
the
cottage
shack
very
clearly
sunny
rooms
white
curtains
bright
cushions
and
books
pictures
and
rugs
mingled
together
rather
confusingly
in
her
mind
when
she
dwelt
upon
the
inside
of
her
future
home
it
would
be
bright
and
cozy
and
homy
she
knew
she
would
love
it
because
it
would
be
hers
and
manley
and
she
could
do
with
it
what
she
would
she
bothered
about
that
no
more
than
she
did
about
the
dresses
she
would
be
wearing
next
year
cold
spring
ranch
think
of
the
allurement
of
that
name
just
as
it
stands
without
any
disconcerting
qualification
whatever
any
girl
with
hair
and
eyes
to
match
and
a
dreamy
temperament
that
beautifies
everything
her
imagination
touches
would
be
sure
to
build
a
veritable
eve
garden
around
those
three
small
words
with
that
picture
still
before
her
mental
vision
clear
as
if
she
had
all
her
life
been
familiar
with
it
in
reality
she
rode
beside
manley
for
three
weary
hours
across
a
wide
wide
prairie
which
looked
perfectly
level
when
you
viewed
it
as
a
whole
but
which
proved
all
hills
and
hollows
when
you
drove
over
it
during
those
three
hours
they
passed
not
one
human
habitation
after
the
first
five
miles
were
behind
them
there
had
been
a
ranch
back
there
against
a
bluff
val
had
gazed
upon
it
and
then
turned
her
head
away
distressed
because
human
beings
could
consent
to
live
in
such
unattractive
surroundings
it
was
bad
in
its
way
as
hope
she
thought
but
did
not
say
because
manley
was
talking
about
his
cattle
and
she
did
not
want
to
interrupt
him
after
that
there
had
been
no
houses
of
any
sort
there
was
a
fence
stretching
away
and
away
until
the
posts
were
mere
pencil
lines
against
the
blue
where
the
fence
dipped
over
the
last
hill
before
the
sky
bent
down
and
kissed
the
earth
the
length
of
that
fence
was
appalling
in
a
vague
wordless
way
val
unconsciously
drew
closer
to
her
husband
when
she
looked
at
it
and
shivered
in
spite
of
the
midsummer
heat
you
getting
manley
put
his
arm
around
her
and
held
her
there
we
over
now
a
little
longer
and
we
be
then
he
bethought
him
that
she
might
want
some
preparation
for
that
you
must
expect
much
little
wife
it
a
bachelor
house
so
far
you
have
to
do
some
fixing
before
it
will
suit
you
you
do
look
forward
to
anything
like
fern
hill
do
you
val
laughed
and
bent
solicitously
over
the
suitcase
which
her
feet
had
marred
of
course
i
do
nothing
out
here
is
like
fern
hill
i
know
our
ranch
is
different
from
anything
i
ever
knew
but
i
know
just
how
it
will
be
and
how
everything
will
oh
do
you
manley
looked
at
her
a
bit
anxiously
for
three
years
val
reminded
him
you
have
been
describing
things
to
me
you
told
me
what
it
was
like
when
you
first
took
the
place
you
described
everything
from
cold
spring
coulee
to
the
house
you
built
and
the
spring
under
the
rock
wall
and
even
the
meadow
lark
nest
you
found
in
the
weeds
of
i
it
going
to
seem
pretty
rough
at
first
he
observed
rather
apologetically
yes
but
i
shall
not
mind
that
i
want
it
to
be
rough
i
tired
to
death
of
the
smug
smoothness
of
my
life
so
far
oh
if
you
only
knew
how
i
have
hated
fern
hill
these
last
three
years
especially
since
i
graduated
just
the
same
petty
little
lives
lived
in
the
same
petty
little
way
day
in
and
day
out
every
sunday
the
class
in
sunday
school
and
the
bells
ringing
and
the
same
little
walk
of
four
blocks
there
and
back
every
tuesday
and
friday
the
club
meeting
the
merry
maids
and
the
mascot
both
just
alike
where
you
did
the
same
things
and
the
same
round
of
calls
with
mamma
on
the
same
people
twice
a
month
the
year
round
and
the
little
social
festivities
ah
manley
if
you
only
knew
how
i
tong
for
something
rough
and
real
in
my
life
it
was
very
nearly
what
she
said
to
the
teacher
on
the
train
well
if
that
what
you
want
you
come
to
the
right
place
he
told
her
dryly
later
when
they
drew
close
to
a
red
coulee
rim
which
he
said
was
the
far
side
of
cold
spring
coulee
she
forgot
how
tired
she
was
and
felt
every
nerve
quiver
with
eagerness
later
still
when
in
the
glare
of
a
july
sun
they
drove
around
a
low
knoll
dipped
into
a
wide
parched
coulee
and
then
came
upon
a
barren
little
habitation
inclosed
in
a
meager
fence
of
the
barbed
wire
she
thought
so
detestable
she
shut
her
eyes
mentally
to
something
she
could
not
quite
bring
herself
to
face
he
lifted
her
out
and
tumbled
the
great
trunks
upon
the
ground
before
he
drove
on
to
the
corrals
here
the
key
he
said
if
you
want
to
go
in
i
wo
be
more
than
a
minute
or
he
did
not
look
into
her
face
when
he
spoke
val
stood
just
inside
the
gate
and
tried
to
adjust
all
this
to
her
mental
picture
there
was
the
front
yard
for
instance
a
few
straggling
vines
against
the
porch
and
a
sickly
cluster
or
two
of
blossoms
those
were
the
sweet
peas
surely
the
bed
of
plants
without
so
much
as
a
bud
of
promise
she
recognized
after
a
second
glance
as
the
poppies
for
the
rest
there
were
weeds
against
the
fence
grass
trodden
flat
yellow
gravelly
patches
where
nothing
grew
and
a
glaring
burning
sun
beating
down
upon
it
all
the
cottage
never
afterward
did
she
think
of
it
by
that
name
but
always
as
a
shack
was
built
of
boards
placed
perpendicularly
with
battens
nailed
over
the
cracks
to
keep
out
the
wind
and
the
snow
at
one
side
was
a
kitchen
and
on
the
other
side
was
the
porch
that
was
just
a
narrow
platform
with
a
roof
over
it
it
was
not
wide
enough
for
a
to
say
nothing
of
swinging
a
hammock
in
the
first
hasty
inspection
this
seemed
to
be
about
all
she
was
still
hesitating
before
the
door
when
manley
came
back
from
putting
up
the
horses
i
afraid
your
flowers
are
a
lost
cause
he
remarked
cheerfully
they
were
looking
pretty
good
two
or
three
weeks
ago
this
hot
weather
has
dried
them
up
next
year
we
have
water
down
here
to
the
house
all
these
things
take
oh
of
course
they
val
managed
to
smile
into
his
eyes
let
see
how
many
dishes
you
left
dirty
bachelors
always
leave
their
dishes
unwashed
on
the
table
do
they
sometimes
but
i
generally
wash
he
led
the
way
into
the
house
which
smelled
hot
and
close
with
the
odor
of
food
long
since
cooked
and
eaten
before
he
threw
all
the
windows
open
the
front
room
was
clean
after
a
man
idea
of
cleanliness
the
floor
was
covered
with
an
exceedingly
dusty
carpet
and
a
rug
or
two
her
latest
photograph
was
nailed
to
the
wall
and
when
val
saw
it
she
broke
into
hysterical
laughter
you
nailed
your
colors
to
the
mast
she
cried
and
after
that
it
was
all
a
joke
the
couch
with
the
calico
cushions
and
the
cowhide
spread
was
a
matter
for
mirth
she
sat
down
upon
it
to
try
it
and
was
informed
that
chicken
wire
makes
a
fine
spring
the
rickety
table
with
tobacco
magazines
and
books
placed
upon
it
in
orderly
piles
was
something
to
smile
over
the
chairs
and
especially
the
one
cane
rocker
which
went
sidewise
over
the
floor
if
you
rocked
in
it
long
enough
were
pronounced
original
in
the
kitchen
the
same
masculine
idea
of
cleanliness
and
order
obtained
the
stove
was
quite
red
but
it
had
been
swept
clean
the
table
was
pushed
against
the
only
window
there
and
the
back
part
was
filled
with
glass
preserve
jars
cans
and
a
loaf
of
bread
wrapped
carefully
in
paper
but
the
oilcloth
cover
was
clean
did
it
not
show
quite
plainly
the
marks
of
the
last
washing
two
frying
pans
were
turned
bottom
up
on
an
obscure
table
in
an
obscure
corner
of
the
room
and
a
zinc
water
pail
stood
beside
them
there
were
other
details
which
impressed
themselves
upon
her
shrinking
brain
and
though
she
still
insisted
upon
smiling
at
everything
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
holding
up
her
skirts
quite
unconsciously
as
if
she
were
standing
at
a
muddy
street
crossing
wondering
how
in
the
world
she
was
ever
going
to
reach
the
other
side
is
it
all
deliciously
primitive
she
asked
in
a
weak
little
voice
when
the
smile
would
stay
no
longer
i
love
it
that
was
a
lie
more
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
fibbing
for
the
sake
of
politeness
or
anything
else
so
that
the
words
stood
for
a
good
deal
manley
looked
into
the
zinc
water
pail
took
it
up
and
started
for
an
outer
door
rattling
the
tin
dipper
as
he
went
want
to
go
up
to
the
spring
he
queried
over
his
shoulder
water
the
first
thing
horribly
val
turned
to
follow
him
oh
yes
the
spring
she
stopped
however
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
no
dear
there
be
plenty
of
other
times
stay
he
gave
her
a
glance
bright
with
love
and
blind
happiness
in
her
presence
there
and
went
off
whistling
and
rattling
the
pail
at
his
side
val
did
not
even
watch
him
go
she
stood
still
in
the
kitchen
and
looked
at
the
table
and
at
the
stove
and
at
the
upturned
frying
pans
she
watched
two
great
horseflies
buzzing
against
a
and
when
she
could
endure
that
no
longer
she
went
into
the
front
room
and
stared
vacantly
around
at
the
bare
walls
when
she
saw
her
picture
again
nailed
fast
beside
the
kitchen
door
her
face
lost
a
little
of
its
frozen
blankness
enough
so
that
her
lips
quivered
until
she
bit
them
into
steadiness
she
went
then
to
the
door
and
stood
looking
dully
out
into
the
parched
yard
and
at
the
wizened
little
pea
vines
clutching
feebly
at
their
trellis
beyond
stretched
the
bare
hills
with
the
wavering
brown
line
running
down
the
nearest
one
the
line
that
she
knew
was
the
trail
from
town
she
was
guilty
of
just
one
rebellious
sentence
before
she
struggled
back
to
optimism
i
said
i
wanted
it
to
be
rough
but
i
did
mean
why
this
is
just
squalid
she
looked
down
the
coulee
and
glimpsed
the
river
flowing
calmly
past
the
mouth
of
it
a
majestic
blue
belt
fringed
sparsely
with
green
it
must
be
a
mile
away
but
it
relieved
wonderfully
the
monotony
of
brown
hills
and
the
vivid
coloring
brightened
her
eyes
she
heard
manley
enter
the
kitchen
set
down
the
pail
of
water
and
come
on
to
where
she
stood
i
forgotten
you
said
we
could
see
the
river
from
here
she
told
him
smiling
over
her
shoulder
it
beautiful
is
it
i
do
suppose
though
there
a
boat
within
millions
of
oh
there
a
boat
down
there
it
leaks
though
i
just
use
it
for
ducks
close
to
shore
admiring
our
view
great
do
you
think
val
clasped
her
hands
before
her
and
let
her
gaze
travel
again
over
the
sweep
of
rugged
hills
it
wonderful
i
thought
i
knew
but
i
see
i
did
i
feel
very
small
manley
does
one
ever
grow
up
to
it
he
seemed
dimly
to
catch
the
note
of
utter
desolation
you
get
used
to
all
that
he
assured
her
i
thought
i
reached
the
place
at
first
but
now
you
could
dog
me
outa
the
he
was
slipping
into
the
vernacular
and
val
noticed
it
and
wondered
dully
if
she
would
ever
do
likewise
she
had
not
yet
admitted
to
herself
that
manley
was
different
she
had
told
herself
many
times
that
it
would
take
weeks
to
wipe
out
the
strangeness
born
of
three
years
separation
he
was
the
same
of
course
everything
else
was
new
and
different
that
was
all
he
seemed
intensely
practical
and
he
seemed
to
feel
that
his
had
all
been
done
by
letter
and
that
nothing
now
remained
save
the
business
of
living
so
when
he
told
her
to
rest
and
that
he
would
get
dinner
and
show
her
how
a
bachelor
kept
house
she
let
him
go
with
no
reply
save
that
vague
impersonal
smile
which
kent
had
encountered
at
the
depot
while
he
rattled
things
about
in
the
kitchen
she
stood
still
in
the
doorway
with
her
fingers
doubled
into
tight
little
fists
and
stared
out
over
the
great
treeless
unpeopled
land
which
had
swallowed
her
alive
she
tried
to
think
and
then
in
another
moment
she
was
trying
not
to
think
glancing
quickly
over
her
shoulder
to
make
sure
manley
was
too
busy
to
follow
her
she
went
off
the
porch
and
stood
uncertain
in
the
parched
inclosure
which
was
the
front
yard
i
may
as
well
see
it
all
and
be
done
she
whispered
and
went
stealthily
around
the
corner
of
the
house
holding
up
her
skirts
as
she
had
done
in
the
kitchen
there
was
a
dim
path
beaten
in
the
wiry
grass
a
path
which
started
at
the
kitchen
door
and
wound
away
up
the
coulee
she
followed
it
undoubtedly
it
would
lead
her
to
the
spring
beyond
that
she
refused
to
let
her
thoughts
travel
in
five
minutes
for
she
went
slowly
she
stopped
beside
a
pool
of
water
and
yellow
mud
a
few
steps
farther
on
a
barrel
had
been
sunk
in
the
ground
at
the
base
of
a
huge
gray
rock
a
barrel
which
filled
slowly
and
spilled
the
overflow
into
the
mud
there
was
also
a
trough
and
there
was
a
barrier
made
of
poles
and
barbed
wire
to
keep
the
cattle
from
the
barrel
one
crawled
between
two
wires
it
would
seem
to
dip
up
water
for
the
house
there
were
no
trees
not
real
trees
there
were
some
chokecherry
bushes
higher
than
her
head
and
there
were
other
bushes
that
did
not
look
particularly
enlivening
with
a
smile
of
bitter
amusement
she
tucked
her
skirts
tightly
around
her
crept
through
the
fence
and
filled
a
chipped
granite
cup
which
stood
upon
a
rock
ledge
and
drank
slowly
then
she
laughed
aloud
the
water
really
cold
she
said
anywhere
else
it
would
be
delicious
and
that
a
spring
i
mercilessly
she
was
stripping
her
mind
of
her
illusions
and
was
clothing
it
in
the
harsher
weave
of
reality
all
these
hills
are
manley
our
she
took
another
sip
and
set
down
the
cup
and
so
cold
spring
ranch
means
all
down
the
coulee
she
heard
manley
call
she
stood
still
pushing
back
a
fallen
lock
of
fine
yellow
hair
she
turned
toward
the
sound
and
the
sun
in
her
eyes
turned
them
yellow
as
the
hair
above
them
she
was
beautiful
in
an
odd
way
if
her
eyes
had
been
blue
or
gray
or
even
brown
she
would
have
been
merely
pretty
but
as
they
were
that
amber
tint
where
one
looked
for
something
else
struck
one
unexpectedly
and
made
her
whole
face
unforgettably
lovely
however
the
color
of
her
eyes
and
her
hair
did
not
interest
her
then
or
make
life
any
easier
she
was
quite
ordinarily
miserable
and
homesick
as
she
went
reluctantly
back
along
the
grassy
trails
the
odor
of
fried
bacon
came
up
to
her
and
she
hated
bacon
she
hated
everything
i
been
to
the
spring
she
called
out
resolutely
cheerful
as
soon
as
she
came
in
sight
of
manley
waiting
in
the
kitchen
door
she
ran
toward
him
lightly
however
does
the
water
keep
so
deliciously
cool
through
this
hot
weather
i
do
wonder
you
call
this
cold
spring
manley
straightened
proudly
i
glad
you
like
it
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
just
at
first
but
you
the
right
stuff
i
might
have
known
it
not
every
woman
could
come
out
here
and
appreciate
this
country
right
at
the
val
stopped
at
the
steps
panting
a
little
from
her
run
and
smiled
unflinchingly
up
into
his
face
chapter
vi
manley
fire
guard
hot
sunlight
winds
as
hot
a
shimmering
heat
which
distorted
objects
at
a
distance
and
made
the
sky
line
a
dazzling
wavering
ribbon
of
faded
blue
and
then
the
dull
haze
of
smoke
which
hung
over
the
land
and
without
tempering
the
heat
turned
the
sun
into
a
huge
coppery
balloon
which
drifted
imperceptibly
from
the
east
to
the
west
and
at
evening
time
settled
softly
down
upon
a
parched
hilltop
and
disappeared
leaving
behind
it
an
ominous
red
glow
as
of
hidden
fires
when
the
wind
blew
the
touch
of
it
seared
the
face
as
the
smoke
tang
assailed
the
nostrils
all
the
world
was
a
weird
unnatural
tint
hard
to
name
never
to
be
forgotten
the
far
horizons
drew
steadily
closer
as
the
days
passed
slowly
and
thickened
the
veil
of
smoke
the
distant
mountains
drew
daily
back
into
dimmer
distance
became
an
obscure
formless
blot
against
the
sky
and
vanished
completely
the
horizon
crouched
then
upon
the
bluffs
across
the
river
moved
up
to
the
line
of
trees
along
its
banks
blotted
them
out
one
day
and
impudently
established
itself
up
the
coulee
time
ceased
to
be
measured
accurately
events
moved
slowly
in
an
unreal
world
of
sultry
heat
and
smoke
and
a
red
sun
wading
heavily
through
the
sky
from
the
east
to
the
west
and
a
moon
as
red
which
followed
meekly
after
men
rode
uneasily
here
and
there
and
when
they
met
they
talked
of
prairie
fires
and
of
fire
guards
and
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
of
the
faint
prospect
of
rain
cattle
driven
from
their
accustomed
feeding
grounds
wandered
aimlessly
over
the
range
and
lowed
often
in
the
night
as
they
drifted
before
the
wind
fifteen
miles
to
the
east
of
cold
spring
coulee
the
wishbone
outfit
watched
uneasily
the
deepening
haze
kent
and
bob
royden
were
put
to
riding
the
range
from
the
river
north
and
west
and
polycarp
jenks
who
had
taken
a
claim
where
were
good
water
and
some
shelter
and
who
never
seemed
to
be
there
for
more
than
a
few
hours
at
a
time
because
of
his
boundless
curiosity
wandered
about
on
his
great
sorrel
with
the
white
legs
and
seemed
always
to
have
the
latest
fire
news
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
always
eager
to
impart
it
to
somebody
to
the
northwest
there
was
the
double
diamond
also
sleeping
with
both
eyes
open
so
to
speak
they
also
had
two
men
out
watching
the
range
though
the
fires
were
said
to
be
all
across
the
river
but
there
was
the
railroad
seaming
the
country
straight
through
the
grassland
and
though
the
company
was
prompt
at
plowing
fire
guards
contract
work
would
always
bear
watching
said
the
stockmen
and
with
the
high
winds
that
prevailed
there
was
no
telling
what
might
happen
so
fred
de
garmo
and
bill
madison
patrolled
the
country
in
rather
desultory
fashion
if
the
truth
be
known
they
liked
best
to
ride
to
the
north
and
east
which
while
following
faithfully
the
railroad
and
the
danger
line
would
bring
them
eventually
to
hope
where
they
never
failed
to
stop
as
long
as
they
dared
for
although
they
never
analyzed
their
feelings
they
knew
that
as
long
as
they
kept
their
jobs
and
their
pay
was
forthcoming
a
few
miles
of
blackened
range
concerned
them
personally
not
at
all
still
barring
a
fondness
for
the
trail
which
led
to
town
they
were
not
unfaithful
to
their
trust
one
day
kent
and
polycarp
met
on
the
brink
of
a
deep
coulee
and
as
is
the
way
of
men
who
ride
the
dim
trails
they
stopped
to
talk
a
bit
polycarp
cracking
his
face
across
the
middle
with
his
habitual
grin
straightened
his
right
leg
to
its
full
length
slid
his
hand
with
difficulty
into
his
pocket
brought
up
a
dirty
fragment
of
plug
tobacco
looked
it
over
inquiringly
and
pried
off
the
corner
with
his
teeth
when
he
had
rolled
it
comfortably
into
his
cheek
and
had
straightened
his
leg
and
replaced
the
tobacco
in
his
pocket
he
was
all
set
and
ready
for
conversation
kent
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
roll
a
cigarette
though
smoking
on
the
range
was
a
weakness
to
be
indulged
in
with
much
care
he
pinched
out
the
blaze
of
his
match
as
usual
and
then
spat
upon
it
for
added
safety
before
throwing
it
away
if
this
heat
does
let
up
he
remarked
the
grass
is
going
to
blaze
up
from
it
wo
need
to
if
you
ask
me
i
would
be
to
see
this
hull
range
afire
any
time
between
you
an
me
kenneth
them
double
diamond
fellers
ai
watching
it
as
close
as
they
might
i
was
away
over
dry
creek
way
yesterday
and
i
seen
where
there
was
two
different
fires
got
through
the
company
guards
and
kited
off
across
the
country
it
jest
that
the
grass
give
out
in
that
red
day
soil
and
starved
both
out
they
out
i
looked
close
all
around
and
there
was
nary
a
track
of
man
or
horse
that
their
business
ridin
line
on
the
railroad
the
section
men
been
workin
off
down
the
other
way
where
a
culvert
got
scorched
up
pretty
bad
by
granny
fred
bill
madison
spend
might
nigh
all
their
time
ridin
the
trail
to
town
they
might
about
watchin
the
railroad
between
the
switches
that
something
for
the
double
diamond
to
worry
over
kent
rebuffed
he
hated
that
sort
of
gossip
which
must
speak
ill
of
somebody
our
winter
range
lays
mostly
south
and
east
we
could
stop
a
fire
between
here
and
the
double
diamond
even
if
they
let
one
get
past
polycarp
regarded
him
cunningly
with
his
little
slitlike
eyes
mebbe
you
could
he
said
doubtfully
and
then
again
mebbe
you
could
oncet
it
got
past
cold
spring
he
shook
his
wizened
head
slowly
leaned
and
expectorated
gravely
man
fleetwood
keeping
tab
pretty
close
over
that
polycarp
gave
a
grunt
that
was
half
a
chuckle
man
fleetwood
keeping
tab
on
what
runs
down
his
gullet
he
corrected
i
seen
him
an
his
wife
out
burnin

t
other
day
over
on
his
west
line
and
by
granny
it
would
stop
nothing
a
toad
could
jump
it
he
sent
another
stream
of
tobacco
juice
afar
with
the
grave

by
granny

way

at

city
girl
by
granny
with
ruffles
on
her
skirts
to
ketch
afire
if
she
was
mighty
keerful
and
a
big
straw

tied
down

a
veil
and
kid
gloves
on

hands
and
her
yeller
hair
kinda
fallin
around
her
face
and
them
yeller

snappin
like

by
granny
if
she
did
make
as
purty
a
picture
as
i
ever
want
to
set
eyes
on
slim
and
straight
jest
like
a
storybook
woman
she
was
all
smoke
an
dirt
a
big
flake
of
burned
grass
was
on
her
hair
i
took
notice
and
them
ruffles
was
black
up
to
her
knees
and
she
had
a
big
smut
on
her
cheek
but
she
was
right
there
with
her
stack
of
blues
by
granny
settin
into
the
game
like
a
a
he
leaned
and
spat
but
burnin

there

very
much
she
says
to

but
at
present
she
says

think
of

then
by
granny
she
turns
right
around
and
smiles
up
at
me
made
me
feel
like
somebody
tickled
m
ear
with
a
spear
of
hay
when
i
was
asleep
by
granny
never
felt
anything
like
it
not

smilin
at

jenks
she

horribly
proud

and
i
never
forgive
you
for

i
and
then
by
granny
if
she
did
begin
to
blink
them
eyes
and
i
felt
like
a
a
he
put
the
usual
period
to
his
hesitation
between
you
an
kenneth
he
added
looking
at
kent
slyly
she
ai
having
none
too
easy
a
time
man
gone
back
to
drinkin
i
knowed
all
the
time
he
would
stay
braced
up
very
long
lasted
about
six
weeks
from
all
i
hear
mebbe
she
reely
thinks
it
jest
headaches
ails
him
when
he
comes
back
from
town
i
dunno
you
ca
never
tell
what
idees
a
woman
got
tacked
away
under
her
hair
from
all
i
gether
i
to
know
nothing
about
do
want
to
know
but
i
guess
he
hinted
cunningly
i
know
as
much
about
as
you
do
hey
kenneth
you
do
seem
to
chase
after
none
yourself
whereabouts
did
man
run
his
guards
asked
kent
passing
over
the
invitation
to
personal
confessions
polycarp
gave
a
grunt
of
disdain
just
on
the
west
rim
of
his
coulee
about
forty
rod
of
guard
and
slanted
so
it
shoot
a
fire
right
into
high
grass
at
the
head
of
the
coulee
and
send
it
kitin
over
this
way
that
supposin
it
turns
a
fire
which
it
wo
six
feet
a
fall
like
this
here
why
i
never
see
grass
so
thick
on
this
range
did
you
i
wonder
did
he
burn
that
extra
guard
kent
was
keeping
himself
rigidly
to
the
subject
of
real
importance
no
by
granny
he
did
not
unless
he
done
it
since
he
went
to
town
for
suthin
and
he
might
nigh
forgot
to
go
home
he
was
there
about
three
an
i
says
to
him
well
i
got
to
be
kent
gathered
up
the
reins
and
went
his
way
leaving
polycarp
just
in
the
act
of
drawing
his
plug
from
his
pocket
by
his
usual
laborious
method
in
mental
preparation
for
another
half
hour
of
talk
if
you
ridin
over
that
way
kenneth
you
better
take
a
look
at
guard
he
called
after
him
a
good
mile
of
guard
along
there
would
help
a
lot
if
a
fire
got
started
beyond
the
way
he
fixed
it
it
ai
no
account
at
kent
proved
by
a
gesture
that
he
heard
him
and
rode
on
without
turning
to
look
back
already
his
form
was
blurred
as
polycarp
gazed
after
him
and
in
another
minute
or
two
he
was
blotted
out
completely
by
the
smoke
veil
though
he
rode
upon
the
level
polycarp
watched
him
craftily
though
there
was
no
need
until
he
was
completely
hidden
then
he
went
on
ruminating
upon
the
faults
of
his
acquaintances
kent
had
no
intention
of
riding
over
to
cold
spring
he
had
not
been
there
since
manley
marriage
though
he
had
been
a
frequent
visitor
before
and
unless
necessity
drove
him
there
it
would
be
long
before
he
faced
again
the
antagonism
of
fleetwood
still
he
was
mentally
uncomfortable
and
he
felt
much
resentment
against
polycarp
jenks
because
he
had
caused
that
discomfort
what
was
it
to
him
if
manley
had
gone
bock
to
drinking
he
asked
the
question
more
than
once
and
he
answered
always
that
it
was
nothing
to
him
of
course
still
he
wished
futilely
that
he
had
not
been
quite
so
eager
to
cover
up
manley
weakness
and
deceive
the
girl
he
ought
to
have
given
her
a
chance
a
cinder
like
a
huge
black
snowflake
struck
him
suddenly
upon
the
cheek
he
looked
up
startled
and
tried
to
see
farther
into
the
haze
which
closed
him
round
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
his
mind
was
turned
from
his
musings
that
the
smoke
was
thicker
the
smell
of
burning
grass
stronger
and
the
breath
of
wind
hotter
upon
his
face
he
turned
looked
away
to
the
west
fancied
there
a
tumbled
blackness
new
to
his
sight
and
put
his
horse
to
a
run
if
there
were
fire
close
then
every
second
counted
and
as
he
raced
over
the
uneven
prairie
he
fumbled
with
the
saddle
string
that
held
a
sodden
sack
tied
fast
to
the
saddle
that
he
might
lose
no
time
the
cinders
grew
thicker
until
the
air
was
filled
with
them
like
a
snowstorm
done
in
india
ink
a
little
farther
and
he
heard
a
faint
crackling
topped
a
ridge
and
saw
not
far
ahead
a
dancing
yellow
line
his
horse
was
breathing
heavily
with
the
pace
he
was
keeping
but
kent
swinging
away
from
the
onrush
of
flame
and
heat
spurred
him
to
a
greater
speed
they
neared
the
end
of
the
crackling
red
line
and
as
kent
swung
in
behind
it
upon
the
burned
ground
he
saw
several
men
beating
steadily
at
the
flames
he
was
hardly
at
work
when
polycarp
came
running
up
and
took
his
place
beside
him
but
beyond
that
kent
paid
no
attention
to
the
others
though
he
heard
and
recognized
the
voice
of
fred
de
garmo
calling
out
to
some
one
the
smoke
which
rolled
up
in
uneven
volumes
as
the
wind
lifted
it
and
bore
it
away
or
let
it
suck
backward
as
it
veered
for
an
instant
blinded
him
while
he
fought
he
heard
other
men
gallop
up
and
after
a
little
some
one
clattered
up
with
a
wagon
filled
with
barrels
of
water
he
ran
to
wet
his
sack
and
saw
that
it
was
blumenthall
himself
foreman
of
the
double
diamond
who
drove
the
team
lucky
it
ai
as
windy
as
it
was
yesterday
and
the
day
before
blumenthall
cried
out
as
kent
stepped
upon
the
brake
block
to
reach
a
barrel
it
sweep
the
whole
country
if
it
kent
nodded
and
ran
back
to
the
fire
trailing
the
dripping
sack
after
him
as
he
passed
polycarp
and
another
he
heard
polycarp
saying
something
about
man
fleetwood
fire
guard
but
he
did
not
stop
to
hear
what
it
was
polycarp
was
always
talking
and
he
did
always
keep
too
closely
to
facts
then
of
a
sudden
he
saw
men
dimly
when
he
glanced
down
the
leaping
fire
line
and
he
knew
that
the
fire
was
almost
conquered
another
frenzied
minute
or
two
and
he
was
standing
in
a
group
of
men
who
dropped
their
charred
blackened
fragments
of
blanket
and
bags
and
began
to
feel
for
their
smoking
material
while
they
stamped
upon
stray
embers
which
looked
live
enough
to
be
dangerous

she
out
said
a
voice
but
it
did
look
for
a
while
as
if
get
away

away
wiping
an
eye
which
held
a
cinder

under
the

if
somebody

in
his
thin
rasping
voice

short
i

he
retorted

and
you

it
right
pretty
soon
this

team
and
come
among
them
if
you
want
to
know
how
it
started
i
can
tell
you
somebody
dropped
a
match
or
a
cigarette
or
something
by
the
trail
up
here
a
ways
i
saw
where
it
started
when
i
went
to
cold
spring
after
the
last
load
of
water
and
if
i
knew
who
it
was
polycarp
launched
his
opinion
first
as
usual
well
i
do
who
done
it
but
by
granny
i
can
might
nigh
guess
who
it
was
there
jest
one
man
that
i
know
of
been
traveling
that
trail
lately
when
he
in
his
sober
senses
here
manley
fleetwood
rode
up
to
them
coughing
at
the
soot
his
horse
kicked
up
say
you
fellows
come
on
over
to
the
house
and
have
something
to
eat
and
he
added
significantly
something
i
told
my
wife
when
i
saw
the
fire
to
make
plenty
of
coffee
for
fighting
fire
hungry
work
let
me
tell
come
on
no
hanging
back
you
know
there
be
lots
of
coffee
and
i
got
a
quart
of
something
better
cached
in
the
haystack
as
he
had
said
fighting
fire
is
hungry
work
and
none
save
blumenthall
who
was
dyspeptic
and
only
ate
twice
a
day
and
then
of
certain
foods
prepared
by
himself
declined
the
invitation
chapter
vii
val
new
duties
to
val
the
days
of
heat
and
smoke
and
the
isolation
had
made
life
seem
unreal
like
a
dream
which
holds
one
fast
and
yet
is
absurd
and
utterly
improbable
her
past
was
pushed
so
far
from
her
that
she
could
not
even
long
for
it
as
she
had
done
during
the
first
few
weeks
there
were
nights
of
utter
desolation
when
manley
was
in
town
upon
some
errand
which
prevented
his
speedy
return
nights
when
the
coyotes
howled
much
louder
than
usual
and
she
could
not
sleep
for
the
mysterious
snapping
and
creaking
about
the
shack
but
lay
shivering
with
fear
until
dawn
but
not
for
worlds
would
she
have
admitted
to
manley
her
dread
of
staying
alone
she
believed
it
to
be
necessary
or
he
would
not
require
it
of
her
and
she
wanted
to
be
all
that
he
expected
her
to
be
she
was
very
sensitive
in
those
days
about
doing
her
whole
duty
as
a
wife
the
wife
of
a
western
rancher
for
that
reason
when
manley
shouted
to
her
the
news
of
the
fire
as
he
galloped
past
the
shack
and
told
her
to
have
something
for
the
men
to
eat
when
the
fire
was
out
she
never
thought
of
demurring
or
explaining
to
him
that
there
was
scarcely
any
wood
and
that
she
could
not
cook
a
meal
without
fuel
instead
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
and
let
him
go
and
when
he
was
quite
out
of
sight
she
went
up
to
the
corrals
to
see
if
she
could
find
another
useless
pole
or
a
broken
board
or
two
which
her
slight
strength
would
be
sufficient
to
break
up
with
the
axe
till
she
came
to
montana
val
had
never
taken
an
axe
in
her
hands
but
its
use
was
only
one
of
the
many
things
she
must
learn
of
which
she
had
all
her
life
been
ignorant
there
was
an
old
post
there
lying
beside
a
rusty
overturned
plow
more
than
once
she
had
stopped
and
eyed
it
speculatively
and
the
day
before
she
had
gone
so
far
as
to
lift
an
end
of
it
tentatively
but
she
had
found
it
very
heavy
and
she
had
also
disturbed
a
lot
of
black
bugs
that
went
scurrying
here
and
there
so
that
she
was
forced
to
gather
her
skirts
close
about
her
and
run
for
her
life
where
manley
had
built
his
hayrack
she
had
yesterday
discovered
some
ends
of
planking
hidden
away
in
the
rank
ripened
weeds
and
grass
she
went
there
now
but
there
were
no
more
look
closely
as
she
might
she
circled
the
stable
in
discouragement
picked
up
one
short
piece
of
rotten
board
and
came
back
to
the
post
as
she
neared
it
she
involuntarily
caught
her
skirts
and
held
them
close
in
terror
of
the
black
bugs
she
eyed
it
with
extreme
disfavor
and
finally
ventured
to
poke
it
with
her
slipper
toe
one
lone
bug
scuttled
out
and
away
in
the
tall
weeds
with
the
piece
of
board
she
turned
it
over
stared
hard
at
the
yellowed
grass
beneath
discovered
nothing
so
very
terrifying
after
all
and
in
pure
desperation
dragged
the
post
laboriously
down
to
the
place
where
had
been
the
woodpile
then
lifting
the
heavy
axe
she
went
awkwardly
to
work
upon
it
and
actually
succeeded
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
or
so
in
worrying
an
armful
of
splinters
off
it
she
started
a
fire
and
then
she
had
to
take
the
big
zinc
pail
and
carry
some
water
down
from
the
spring
before
she
could
really
begin
to
cook
anything
manley
work
every
bit
of
it
but
then
manley
was
so
very
busy
and
he
could
remember
all
these
little
things
and
val
hated
to
keep
reminding
him
theoretically
manley
objected
to
her
chopping
wood
or
carrying
water
and
always
seemed
to
feel
a
personal
resentment
when
he
discovered
her
doing
it
practically
however
he
was
more
and
more
often
making
it
necessary
for
her
to
do
these
things
that
is
why
he
returned
with
the
fire
fighters
and
found
val
just
laying
the
cloth
upon
the
table
which
she
had
moved
into
the
front
room
so
that
there
would
be
space
to
seat
her
guests
at
all
four
sides
he
frowned
when
he
looked
in
and
saw
that
they
must
wait
indefinitely
and
her
cheeks
took
on
a
deeper
shade
of
pink
everything
will
be
ready
in
ten
minutes
she
hurriedly
assured
him
how
many
are
there
dear
eight
counting
myself
he
answered
gruffly
get
some
clean
towels
and
we
go
up
to
the
spring
to
wash
and
try
and
have
dinner
ready
when
we
get
back
we
half
with
the
towels
over
his
arm
he
led
the
way
up
to
the
spring
he
must
have
taken
the
trail
which
led
past
the
haystack
for
he
returned
in
much
better
humor
and
introduced
the
men
to
his
wife
with
the
genial
air
of
a
host
who
loves
to
entertain
largely
val
stood
back
and
watched
them
file
in
to
the
table
and
seat
themselves
with
a
noisy
confusion
unpolished
they
were
in
clothes
and
manner
though
she
dimly
appreciated
the
way
in
which
they
refrained
from
looking
at
her
too
intently
and
the
conscious
lowering
of
their
voices
while
they
talked
among
themselves
they
did
however
glance
at
her
surreptitiously
while
she
was
moving
quietly
about
with
her
flushed
cheeks
and
her
hair
falling
becomingly
down
at
the
temples
because
she
had
not
found
a
spare
minute
in
which
to
brush
it
smooth
and
her
dainty
dress
and
crisp
white
apron
she
was
not
like
the
women
they
were
accustomed
to
meet
and
they
paid
her
the
high
tribute
of
being
embarrassed
by
her
presence
she
poured
coffee
until
all
the
cups
were
full
replenished
the
bread
plate
and
brought
more
butter
and
hunted
the
kitchen
over
for
the
can
opener
to
punch
little
holes
in
another
can
of
condensed
cream
and
she
rather
astonished
her
guests
by
serving
it
in
a
beautiful
pitcher
instead
of
the
can
in
which
it
was
bought
they
handled
the
pitcher
awkwardly
because
of
their
mental
uneasiness
and
val
shared
with
them
their
fear
of
breaking
it
and
was
guilty
of
an
audible
sigh
of
relief
when
at
last
it
found
safety
upon
the
table
so
perturbed
was
she
that
even
when
she
decided
that
she
could
do
no
more
for
their
comfort
and
retreated
to
the
kitchen
she
failed
to
realize
that
the
one
extra
plate
meant
an
absent
guest
and
not
a
miscount
in
placing
them
as
she
fancied
she
remembered
that
she
would
need
plenty
of
hot
water
to
wash
all
those
dishes
and
the
zinc
pail
was
empty
it
always
was
it
seemed
to
her
no
matter
how
often
she
filed
it
she
took
the
tin
dipper
out
of
it
so
that
it
would
not
rattle
and
betray
her
purpose
to
manley
sitting
just
inside
the
door
with
his
back
toward
her
and
tiptoed
quite
guiltily
out
of
the
kitchen
once
well
away
from
the
shack
she
ran
she
reached
the
spring
quite
out
of
breath
and
she
actually
bumped
into
a
man
who
stood
carefully
rinsing
a
bloodstained
handkerchief
under
the
overflow
from
the
horse
trough
she
gave
a
little
scream
and
the
pail
went
rolling
noisily
down
the
steep
bank
and
lay
on
its
side
in
the
mud
kent
turned
and
looked
at
her
himself
rather
startled
by
the
unexpected
collision
involuntarily
he
threw
out
his
hand
to
steady
her
how
do
you
do
fleetwood
he
said
with
all
the
composure
he
could
muster
to
his
aid
i
afraid
i
scared
you
my
nose
got
to
bleeding
with
the
heat
i
guess
i
just
now
managed
to
stop
he
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
explain
his
presence
but
he
did
feel
that
talking
would
help
her
recover
her
breath
and
her
color
it
a
plumb
nuisance
to
have
the
nosebleed
so
much
he
added
plaintively
val
was
still
trembling
and
staring
at
him
with
her
odd
eyes
he
glanced
at
her
swiftly
and
then
bent
to
squeeze
the
water
from
his
handkerchief
but
his
trained
eyes
saw
her
in
all
her
dainty
allurement
saw
how
the
coppery
sunlight
gave
a
strange
glint
to
her
hair
and
how
her
eyes
almost
matched
it
in
color
and
how
the
pupils
had
widened
with
fright
he
saw
too
something
wistful
in
her
face
as
though
life
was
none
too
kind
to
her
and
she
had
not
yet
abandoned
her
first
sensation
of
pained
surprise
that
it
should
treat
her
so
that
what
i
get
for
running
she
said
still
panting
a
little
as
she
watched
him
i
thought
all
the
men
were
at
the
table
you
see
your
dinner
will
be
cold
kent
was
a
bit
surprised
at
the
absence
of
cold
hauteur
in
her
manner
his
memory
of
her
had
been
so
different
well
i
used
to
cold
grub
he
smiled
over
his
shoulder
and
anyway
when
your
nose
gets
to
acting
up
with
you
it
like
riding
a
pitching
horse
you
got
to
pass
up
everything
and
give
it
all
your
time
and
then
with
the
daring
that
sometimes
possessed
him
like
a
devil
he
looked
straight
at
her
sure
you
intend
to
give
me
my
dinner
he
quizzed
his
lips
lifting
humorously
at
the
corners
i
kinda
thought
from
the
way
you
turned
me
down
cold
when
we
met
before
you
shut
your
door
in
my
face
if
i
came
pestering
around
how
that
little
flames
of
light
nickered
in
her
eyes
you
are
the
guest
of
my
husband
here
by
his
invitation
she
answered
him
coldly
of
course
i
shall
give
you
your
dinner
if
you
want
he
inspected
his
handkerchief
critically
decided
that
it
was
not
quite
clean
and
held
it
again
under
the
stream
of
water
if
i
want
it
yes
he
drawled
maliciously
maybe
i
not
sure
about
that
part
are
you
a
pretty
fair
cook
perhaps
you
better
interview
your
friends
she
retorted
if
you
are
so
very
fastidious
i
she
drew
her
brows
together
as
if
she
was
in
doubt
as
to
the
proper
method
of
dealing
with
this
impertinence
she
suspected
that
he
was
teasing
her
purposely
but
still
oh
i
can
eat
any
old
thing
he
assured
her
with
calm
effrontery
you
look
as
if
you
learn
easy
and
man
ai
the
worst
cook
i
ever
ate
after
if
he
trained
you
faithful
maybe
it
be
safe
to
take
a
change
how
that
can
you
make
bread
yet
no
she
flung
the
word
at
him
and
i
do
want
to
learn
she
added
at
the
expense
of
her
dignity
kent
shook
his
head
disapprovingly
that
sure
ai
the
proper
spirit
to
show
he
commented
man
must
have
to
beat
you
up
a
good
deal
if
you
talk
back
to
that
he
eyed
her
sidelong
you
a
real
little
wolf
are
you
he
shook
his
head
again
solemnly
and
sighed
a
fellow
sure
must
build
himself
lots
of
trouble
when
he
annexes
a
wife
a
wife
that
wo
learn
to
make
bread
and
that
talks
back
i
plumb
sorry
for
man
we
used
to
be
pretty
good
friends
he
stopped
short
his
face
contrite
val
was
looking
away
and
she
was
winking
very
fast
also
her
lips
were
quivering
unmistakably
though
she
was
biting
them
to
keep
them
steady
kent
stared
at
her
helplessly
say
i
never
thought
you
mind
a
little
joshing
he
said
gently
when
the
silence
was
growing
awkward
i
ought
to
be
killed
you
you
must
get
awful
lonesome
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
quickly
as
if
he
were
the
first
person
who
had
understood
her
blank
loneliness
that
she
told
him
in
an
odd
hesitating
manner
atones
for
the
the
no
one
seems
to
realize
why
do
you
get
out
and
ride
around
or
do
something
beside
stick
right
here
in
this
coulee
like
a
a
cactus
he
demanded
with
a
roughness
that
somehow
was
grateful
to
her
i
bet
you
have
been
a
mile
from
the
ranch
since
man
brought
you
here
why
do
you
go
to
town
with
him
when
he
goes
it
be
a
whole
lot
better
for
you
for
both
of
you
have
you
got
acquainted
with
any
of
the
women
here
yet
i
gamble
you
have
he
was
waving
the
handkerchief
gently
like
a
flag
to
dry
it
val
watched
him
she
had
never
seen
any
one
hold
a
handkerchief
by
the
corners
and
wave
it
up
and
down
like
that
for
quick
drying
and
the
expedient
interested
her
even
while
she
was
wondering
if
it
was
quite
proper
for
him
to
lecture
her
in
that
manner
his
scolding
was
even
more
confusing
than
his
teasing
i
been
down
to
the
river
twice
she
defended
weakly
and
was
angry
with
herself
that
she
could
not
find
words
with
which
to
quell
him
really
he
down
at
her
indulgently
how
did
you
ever
manage
to
get
so
far
it
must
be
all
of
half
a
mile
oh
you
perfectly
horrible
she
flashed
suddenly
i
do
see
how
it
can
possibly
concern
you
whether
i
go
anywhere
or
it
does
though
i
a
lot
i
hate
to
see
taxes
go
up
and
every
lunatic
that
goes
to
the
asylum
costs
the
state
just
that
much
more
i
do
know
an
easier
recipe
for
going
crazy
than
just
to
stay
off
alone
and
think
it
a
fright
the
way
it
gets
and
i
i
suppose
kent
glanced
at
her
approved
mentally
of
the
color
in
her
cheeks
and
the
angry
light
in
her
eyes
and
laughed
at
her
quite
openly
there
nothing
like
getting
good
and
mad
once
in
a
while
to
take
the
kinks
out
of
your
brain
he
observed
and
there
nothing
like
lonesomeness
to
put
in
a
good
fighting
mad
is
what
you
need
now
and
then
i
have
to
put
man
next
i
guess
he
too
no
one
could
accuse
you
of
that
she
retorted
laughing
a
little
in
spite
of
herself
if
i
were
a
man
i
should
want
to
blacken
your
eyes
and
she
blushed
hotly
at
being
betrayed
into
a
personality
which
seemed
to
her
undignified
and
what
was
worse
unrefined
she
turned
her
back
squarely
toward
him
started
down
the
path
and
remembered
that
she
had
not
filled
the
water
bucket
and
that
without
it
she
could
not
consistently
return
to
the
house
kent
interpreted
her
glance
went
sliding
down
the
steep
bank
and
recovered
the
pail
he
was
laughing
to
himself
while
he
rinsed
and
filled
it
at
the
spring
but
he
made
no
effort
to
explain
his
amusement
when
he
came
back
to
where
she
stood
watching
him
val
gave
her
head
a
slight
downward
tilt
to
indicate
her
thanks
turned
and
led
the
way
back
to
the
house
without
a
word
and
he
following
after
watched
her
slim
figure
swinging
lightly
down
the
hill
before
him
and
wondered
vaguely
what
sort
of
a
hell
her
life
was
going
to
be
out
here
where
everything
was
different
from
what
she
had
been
accustomed
to
and
where
she
did
not
seem
to
fit
into
the
scenery
as
he
put
it
you
ought
to
learn
to
ride
horseback
he
advised
unexpectedly
pardon
me
you
ought
to
learn
to
wait
until
your
advice
is
wanted
she
replied
calmly
without
turning
her
head
and
she
added
with
a
sort
of
defiance
i
do
not
feel
the
need
of
either
society
or
diversion
i
assure
you
i
am
perfectly
that
real
nice
he
approved
there
nothing
like
being
satisfied
with
what
handed
out
to
but
though
he
spoke
with
much
unconcern
his
tone
betrayed
his
skepticism
the
others
had
finished
eating
and
were
sitting
upon
their
heels
in
the
shade
of
the
house
smoking
and
talking
in
that
desultory
fashion
common
to
men
just
after
a
good
meal
two
or
three
glanced
rather
curiously
at
kent
and
his
companion
and
he
detected
the
covert
smile
on
the
face
of
polycarp
jenks
and
also
the
amused
twist
of
fred
de
garmo
lips
he
went
past
them
without
a
sign
of
understanding
set
the
water
pail
down
in
its
proper
place
upon
a
bench
inside
the
kitchen
door
tilted
his
hat
to
val
who
happened
to
be
looking
toward
him
at
that
moment
and
went
out
again
what
the
hurry
kenneth
quizzed
polycarp
when
kent
started
toward
the
corral
follow
my
trail
long
enough
and
you
find
out
maybe
kent
snapped
in
reply
he
felt
that
the
whole
group
was
watching
hum
and
he
knew
that
if
he
looked
back
and
caught
another
glimpse
of
fred
de
garmo
sneering
face
he
would
feel
compelled
to
strike
it
a
blow
there
would
be
no
plausible
explanation
of
course
and
kent
was
not
by
nature
a
trouble
hunter
and
so
he
chose
to
ride
away
without
his
dinner
while
polycarp
was
still
wondering
audibly
what
was
the
matter
kent
passed
the
house
on
his
gray
called
man
with
scarcely
a
glance
at
his
host
and
speedily
became
a
dim
figure
in
the
smoke
haze
he
must
be
runnin
away
from
you
fred
polycarp
hinted
grinning
cunningly
what
you
done
to
him
hey
fred
answered
him
with
an
unsatisfactory
scowl
you
sure
would
be
wise
if
you
found
out
everything
you
wanted
to
know
he
said
contemptuously
after
an
appreciable
wait
i
guess
we
better
be
moving
along
he
rose
brushed
off
his
trousers
with
a
downward
sweep
of
his
hands
and
strolled
toward
the
corrals
followed
languidly
by
bill
madison
as
if
they
had
been
waiting
for
a
leader
the
others
rose
also
and
prepared
to
depart
polycarp
proceeded
in
his
usual
laborious
manner
to
draw
his
tobacco
from
his
pocket
and
pry
off
a
corner
why
do
you
burn
them
guards
now
manley
while
you
got
plenty
of
help
he
suggested
turning
his
eyes
toward
the
kitchen
door
where
val
appeared
for
an
instant
to
reach
the
broom
which
stood
outside
because
i
do
want
to
snapped
manley
i
got
plenty
to
do
without
well
they
ai
wide
enough
nor
long
enough
and
they
do
run
in
the
right
direction
if
you
ask
polycarp
spat
solemnly
off
to
the
right
i
do
ask
you
as
it
manley
turned
and
went
into
the
home
polycarp
looked
quizzically
at
the
closed
door
he
mighty
touchy
about
them
guards
for
a
feller
that
thinks
they
all
right
he
remarked
to
no
one
in
particular
some
of
these
days
by
granny
wisht
he
took
my
advice
since
no
one
gave
him
the
slightest
attention
polycarp
did
not
pursue
the
subject
further
instead
with
both
ears
open
to
catch
all
that
was
said
he
trailed
after
the
others
to
the
corral
it
was
a
matter
of
instinct
as
well
as
principle
with
polycarp
jenks
to
let
no
sentence
however
trivial
slip
past
his
hearing
and
his
memory
chapter
viii
the
prairie
fire
a
calamity
expected
feared
and
guarded
against
by
a
whole
community
does
sometimes
occur
and
with
a
suddenness
which
finds
the
victims
unprepared
in
spite
of
all
their
elaborate
precautions
compared
with
the
importance
of
saving
the
range
from
fire
it
was
but
a
trivial
thing
which
took
nearly
every
man
who
dwelt
in
lonesome
land
to
town
on
a
certain
day
when
the
wind
blew
free
from
out
the
west
they
were
weary
of
watching
for
the
fire
which
did
not
come
licking
through
the
prairie
grass
and
a
special
campaign
train
bearing
a
prospective
president
of
our
united
states
was
expected
to
pass
through
hope
that
afternoon
since
all
trains
watered
at
the
red
tank
by
the
creek
there
would
be
a
stop
during
which
the
prospective
president
would
stand
upon
the
rear
platform
and
deliver
a
address
a
few
gracious
words
to
tickle
the
of
his
listeners
and
would
employ
the
other
two
minutes
in
shaking
the
hand
of
every
man
woman
and
child
who
could
reach
him
before
the
train
pulled
out
there
would
be
a
cheer
or
two
given
as
he
was
borne
away
and
there
would
be
something
to
talk
about
afterward
in
the
saloons
scarce
a
man
of
then
had
ever
seen
a
president
and
it
was
worth
riding
far
to
look
upon
a
man
who
even
hoped
for
so
exalted
a
position
manley
went
because
he
intended
to
vote
for
the
man
and
called
it
an
act
of
loyalty
to
his
party
to
greet
the
candidate
also
because
it
took
very
little
now
that
haying
was
over
and
work
did
not
press
to
start
him
down
the
trail
in
the
direction
of
hope
at
the
blumenthall
ranch
no
man
save
the
cook
remained
at
home
and
he
only
because
he
had
a
boil
on
his
neck
which
sapped
his
interest
in
all
things
else
polycarp
jenks
was
in
town
by
nine
and
only
one
man
remained
at
the
wishbone
that
man
was
kent
and
he
stayed
because
according
to
his
outraged
companions
he
was
an
ornery
cuss
and
his
bump
of
patriotism
was
a
hollow
in
his
skull
kent
had
told
them
one
and
all
that
he
ride
miles
to
shake
hands
with
the
deity
himself
which
however
is
not
a
verbatim
report
of
his
statement
the
prospective
president
had
not
done
anything
so
big
he
said
that
a
man
should
want
to
break
his
neck
getting
to
town
just
to
watch
him
go
by
he
was
dead
sure
he
for
one
was
going
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
over
any
politician
still
he
saddled
and
rode
with
his
fellows
for
a
mile
or
two
and
called
them
unseemly
names
in
a
facetious
tone
and
the
men
of
the
wishbone
answered
his
taunts
with
shrill
yells
of
derision
when
he
swung
out
of
the
trail
and
jogged
away
to
the
south
and
finally
passed
out
of
sight
in
the
haze
which
still
hung
depressingly
over
the
land
oddly
enough
while
all
the
men
save
kent
were
waiting
hilariously
in
hope
to
greet
with
enthusiasm
the
brief
presence
of
the
man
who
would
fain
be
their
political
chief
the
train
which
bore
him
eastward
scattered
fiery
destruction
abroad
as
it
sped
across
their
range
four
minutes
late
and
straining
to
make
up
the
time
before
the
next
stop
they
had
thought
the
railroad
safe
at
last
what
with
the
guards
and
the
numerous
burned
patches
where
the
fire
had
jumped
the
plowed
boundary
and
blackened
the
earth
to
the
fence
which
marked
the
line
of
the
right
of
way
and
in
some
places
had
burned
beyond
it
took
a
special
train
of
that
bitter
presidential
campaign
to
find
a
weak
spot
in
the
guard
and
to
send
a
spark
straight
into
the
thickest
bunch
of
wiry
sand
grass
where
the
wind
could
fan
it
to
a
blaze
and
then
seize
it
and
bend
the
tall
flame
tongues
until
they
licked
around
the
next
tuft
of
grass
and
the
next
and
the
next
until
the
spark
was
grown
to
a
long
leaping
line
of
fire
sweeping
eastward
with
the
relentless
rush
of
a
tidal
wave
upon
a
beach
arline
hawley
was
perhaps
the
only
citizen
of
hope
who
had
deliberately
chosen
to
absent
herself
from
the
crowd
standing
in
perspiring
expectation
upon
the
depot
platform
she
had
permitted
minnie
the
breed
girl
to
go
and
had
even
grudgingly
consented
to
her
using
a
box
of
cornstarch
as
first
aid
to
her
complexion
arline
had
not
approved
however
of
either
the
complexion
or
the
occasion
what
you
want
to
go
and
plaster
your
face
up
with
starch
for
gits
me
she
had
criticised
frankly
seems
to
me
you
homely
enough
without
lookin
silly
into
the
bargain
nobody
going
to
look
at
you
no
matter
what
you
do
they
out
to
rubber
at
a
higher
mark
than
you
be
and
what
they
expect
to
see
so
great
gits
me
he
ai
nothing
but
a
man
and
land
knows
men
is
common
enough
and
ornery
enough
without
runnin
like
a
band
of
sheep
to
see
one
i
do
see
as
he
any
better
jest
because
runnin
for
president
if
he
gits
beat
he
want
to
hide
his
head
in
a
hole
in
the
ground
look
at
my
walt
was
the
biggest
man
in
hope
and
so
he
would
so
much
as
pack
a
bucket
of
water
all
fall
or
chop
up
a
tie
for
kindlin
till
the
day
after
and
what
was
he
then
but
a
back
number
that
everybody
give
the
laugh
till
he
up
and
blowed
his
brains
out
any
fool
can
for
president
it
the
feller
that
gits
there
that
counts
say
that
ribbon
sure
looks
fierce
on
that
green
dress
but
i
reckon
blood
will
tell
even
if
it
injun
blood
or
you
be
late
and
have
your
trouble
for
your
pay
but
hurry
back
the
agony
over
the
bread
be
ready
to
mix
even
after
the
girl
was
gone
her
finery
in
the
sweeping
west
wind
arline
muttered
aloud
her
opinion
of
men
and
particularly
of
politicians
who
rode
about
in
special
trains
and
expected
the
homage
of
their
fellows
she
was
in
the
back
yard
taking
her
white
clothes
off
the
line
when
the
special
came
puffing
slowly
into
town
to
emphasize
her
disapproval
of
the
whole
system
of
politics
she
turned
her
back
square
toward
it
and
laid
violent
hold
of
a
sheet
there
was
a
smudge
of
cinders
upon
its
white
surface
and
it
crushed
crisply
under
her
thumb
with
the
unmistakable
feel
of
burned
grass
now
what
in
time
began
arline
aloud
after
the
manner
of
women
whose
tongues
must
keep
pace
with
their
thoughts
that
there
feels
fresh
and
with
a
sniff
at
the
spot
with
the
wisdom
of
much
experience
she
faced
the
hot
wind
and
sniffed
again
while
her
eyes
searched
keenly
the
sky
line
which
was
the
ragged
top
of
the
bluff
marking
the
northern
boundary
of
the
great
prairie
land
a
trifle
darker
it
was
there
and
there
was
a
certain
sullen
glow
discernible
only
to
eyes
trained
to
read
the
sky
for
warning
signals
of
snow
fire
and
flood
that
a
fire
and
it
this
side
of
the
river
and
if
it
is
then
the
railroad
set
it
and
there
ai
a
livin
thing
to
stop
it
an
the
jest
right
a
curdled
roll
of
smoke
showed
plainly
for
a
moment
in
the
haze
she
crammed
her
armful
of
sheets
into
the
battered
willow
basket
threw
two
clothespins
hastily
toward
the
same
receptacle
and
ran
the
special
had
just
come
to
a
stop
at
the
depot
the
cattlemen
cowboys
and
townspeople
were
packed
close
around
the
rear
of
the
train
their
backs
to
the
wind
and
the
disaster
sweeping
down
upon
them
their
browned
faces
upturned
to
the
sleek
carefully
groomed
man
in
the
suit
with
a
flaunting
prairie
sunflower
ostentatiously
displayed
in
his
buttonhole
and
with
his
campaign
smile
upon
his
lips
and
dull
boredom
looking
out
of
his
eyes
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
was
saying
as
he
smiled
you
favoured
ones
whose
happy
lot
it
is
to
live
in
the
most
glorious
state
of
our
glorious
union
i
greet
you
and
i
envy
you
arline
with
her
soiled
kitchen
apron
her
ragged
coil
of
hair
her
face
and
faded
eyes
which
blazed
with
excitement
pushed
unceremoniously
through
the
crowd
and
confronted
him
undazzled
mister
candidate
you
better
move
on
and
give
these
men
a
chancet
to
save
their
she
cried
shrilly
they
got
something
to
do
besides
stand
around
here
and
listen
at
you
throwin
campaign
loads
the
hull
afire
back
of
us
and
the
wind
bringin
it
down
on
a
long
she
turned
from
the
astounded
candidate
and
glared
at
the
startled
crowd
every
one
of
whom
she
knew
personally
i
must
say
i
got
my
opinion
of
a
bunch
that
stand
here
swallowin
a
lot
of
hot
air
while
their
coat
tails
is
most
ready
to
ketch
afire
her
voice
was
rasping
and
it
carried
to
the
farthest
of
them
you
make
me
political
slush
all
of
it
and
the
hull
darned
country
behind
you
the
crowd
moved
uneasily
then
scattered
away
from
the
shelter
of
the
depot
to
where
they
could
snuff
inquiringly
the
wind
like
dogs
in
the
leash
that
right
yelled
blumenthall
of
the
double
diamond
there
a
fire
sure
as
hell
he
started
to
run
the
man
behind
him
hesitated
but
a
second
then
gripped
his
hat
against
the
push
of
the
wind
and
began
running
presently
men
women
and
children
were
running
all
in
one
direction
the
prospective
president
stood
agape
upon
the
platform
of
his
car
his
chosen
allies
grouped
foolishly
around
him
it
was
the
first
time
men
had
turned
from
his
presence
with
his
gracious
flatteringly
noncommittal
speech
unuttered
his
hand
unshaken
his
smiling
bowing
departure
unmarked
by
cheers
growing
fainter
as
he
receded
only
arline
tarried
her
thin
fingers
gripping
the
arm
of
her
breed
girl
lest
she
catch
the
panic
and
run
with
the
others
arline
tilted
back
her
head
upon
her
scrawny
shoulders
and
eyed
the
prospective
president
with
antagonism
unconcealed
i
got
something
to
say
to
you
before
you
go
she
announced
in
her
rasping
voice
with
its
querulous
note
i
want
to
tell
you
that
the
chances
are
a
hundred
to
one
you
set
that
fire
yourself
with
your
engine
that
haulin
you
around
over
the
country
so
you
can
jolly
men
into
votin
for
you
your
train
the
only
one
over
the
road
since
noon
and
that
fire
started
from
the
railroad
the
hull
town
liable
to
burn
unless
it
can
be
stopped
the
other
side
the
creek
to
say
nothing
of
the
range
that
feeds
our
stock
and
the
hay
and
maybe
houses
and
maybe
she
caught
her
breath
and
almost
shrieked
the
last
three
words
as
a
dreadful
probability
flashed
into
her
mind
i
know
a
woman
just
a
girl
and
she
back
there
twenty
mile
and
her
man
here
to
look
at
you
go
by
i
hope
you
git
beat
just
for
that
if
this
town
ketches
afire
and
burns
up
i
hope
you
run
into
the
ditch
before
you
git
ten
mile
if
you
was
a
man
and
them
fellers
with
you
was

hold
up
your
train
and
help
save
the
town
every
feller
counts
when
it
comes
to
fightin
she
stopped
and
eyed
the
group
keenly
but
you
wo
i
do
reckon
you
ever
done
anything
with
them
hands
in
your
life
that
would
grind
a
little
honest
dirt
into
your
knuckles
and
under
them
shiny
nails
the
prospective
president
turned
red
to
his
ears
and
hastily
removed
his
immaculate
hands
from
where
they
had
been
resting
upon
the
railing
and
he
did
not
hold
up
the
train
while
he
and
his
allies
stopped
to
help
save
the
town
the
whistle
gave
a
warning
toot
the
bell
jangled
and
the
train
slid
away
toward
the
next
town
leaving
arline
staring
after
it
the
darned
chump
he
made
votes
hand
over
fist
if
he
called
my
bluff
but
i
knew
he
would
soon
as
i
seen
his
face
he
ai
man
he
real
sighed
minnie
feebly
attempting
to
release
her
arm
from
the
grasp
of
her
mistress
and
did
you
notice
the
fellow
with
the
big
yellow
mustache
he
kept
eyin
me
well
i
do
wonder
but
it
ai
anything
to
your
credit
snapped
arline
facing
her
toward
the
hotel
you
do
look
like
sin
in
that
green
dress
and
with
all
that
starch
on
your
face
you
git
along
to
the
house
and
mix
that
bread
first
thing
you
do
and
start
a
fire
and
if
i
ai
back
by
that
time
you
go
ahead
with
the
supper
you
know
what
to
git
we
liable
to
have
all
the
tables
full
so
you
set
all
of
she
was
hurrying
away
when
the
girl
called
to
her
did
you
mean
mis
fleetwood
when
you
said
that
about
the
woman
burning
and
do
you
she
really
in
the
fire
you
shut
up
and
go
along
cried
arline
roughly
under
the
stress
of
her
own
fears
how
in
time
anybody
going
to
tell
that
twenty
miles
away
she
left
the
street
and
went
hurrying
through
back
yards
and
across
vacant
lots
crawled
through
a
wire
fence
and
so
reached
without
any
roundabout
method
the
trail
which
led
to
the
top
of
the
bluff
where
the
whole
town
was
breathlessly
assembling
her
figure
merged
into
the
haze
as
she
half
trotted
up
the
steep
road
swinging
her
arms
like
a
man
her
skirts
flapping
in
the
wind
as
she
went
she
kept
muttering
to
herself
if
she
really
is
caught
by
the
fire
and
her
alone
and
man
half
drunk
she
whirled
and
stood
waiting
for
the
horseman
who
was
galloping
up
the
trail
behind
her
you
going
home
man
you
do
think
it
could
git
to
your
place
do
you
she
shouted
the
questions
at
him
as
he
pounded
past
manley
sallow
white
with
terror
shook
his
head
vaguely
and
swung
his
heavy
quirt
down
upon
the
flanks
of
his
horse
arline
lowered
her
head
against
the
dust
kicked
into
her
face
as
he
went
tearing
past
her
and
kept
doggedly
on
some
one
came
rattling
up
behind
her
with
empty
barrels
dancing
erratically
in
a
wagon
and
she
left
the
trail
to
make
room
the
hostler
from
their
own
stable
it
was
who
drove
and
at
the
creek
ahead
of
them
he
stopped
to
fill
the
barrels
arline
passed
him
by
and
kept
on
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
women
and
children
were
gathered
in
a
whimpering
group
arline
joined
them
and
gazed
out
over
the
prairie
where
the
smoke
was
rolling
toward
them
and
lifting
here
and
there
let
a
flare
of
yellow
through
it
show
up
fine
at
dark
a
fat
woman
in
a
buggy
remarked
nothing
grander
to
look
at
than
a
prairie
fire
at
night
i
do
hope
she
added
weakly
it
do
do
no
great
damage
oh
it
wo
arline
cut
in
with
savage
sarcasm
panting
from
her
climb
it
bound
to
sweep
the
hull
country
slick
an
clean
and
maybe
burn
us
all
out
but
that
wo
matter
so
long
as
it
looks
purty
after
dark
they
say
it
a
good
ten
mile
away
yet
another
woman
volunteered
encouragingly
they
git
it
stopped
all
right
there
lots
of
men
here
to
fight
it
thank
goodness
arline
moved
on
to
where
a
plow
was
being
hurriedly
unloaded
from
a
wagon
the
horses
hitched
to
it
and
a
man
already
grasping
the
handles
in
an
aggressive
manner
as
she
came
up
he
went
off
yelling
his
opinions
and
turning
a
shallow
uneven
furrow
for
a
back
fire
within
five
minutes
another
plow
was
tearing
up
the
sod
in
an
opposite
direction
if
it
jumps
here
or
they
ca
turn
it
the
creek
help
a
lot
some
one
was
yelling
the
plowed
furrows
lengthened
the
horses
sweating
and
throwing
their
heads
up
and
down
with
the
discomfort
of
the
pace
they
must
keep
whiplashes
whistled
and
the
drivers
urged
them
on
with
much
shouting
blumenthall
cut
off
with
his
men
from
reaching
his
own
ranch
was
directing
a
group
about
to
set
a
back
fire
his
voice
boomed
as
if
he
were
shouting
across
a
milling
herd
a
roll
of
his
eye
brought
his
attention
momentarily
from
the
work
and
he
ran
toward
a
horseman
who
was
gesticulating
wildly
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
riding
straight
toward
the
fire
hi
fleetwood
we
need
you
here
he
yelled
you
ca
get
home
now
and
you
know
it
the
fire
past
your
place
already
you
have
to
ride
through
it
you
fool
hey
your
wife
home
alone
he
stood
absolutely
still
and
stared
out
to
the
southwest
where
the
smoke
cloud
was
rolling
closer
with
every
breath
he
drew
his
fingers
across
his
forehead
and
glanced
at
the
men
around
him
also
stunned
into
inactivity
by
the
tragedy
behind
the
words
well
get
to
work
men
we
got
to
save
the
town
fine
time
to
burn
guards
when
a
fire
loping
up
on
you
but
that
the
way
it
goes
generally
this
ought
to
been
done
a
month
ago
put
it
off
and
put
it
off
while
they
haggle
over
bids
brinberg
you
and
i
string
the
fire
the
rest
of
you
watch
it
do
jump
back
and
say
he
shouted
to
the
group
around
manley
do
let
that
crazy
fool
start
off
now
put
him
to
work
best
thing
for
him
but
my
god
that
awful
he
did
not
shout
the
last
sentence
he
spoke
so
that
only
the
nearest
man
heard
him
heard
and
nodded
dumb
assent
manley
raged
sitting
helpless
there
upon
his
horse
they
would
not
let
him
ride
out
toward
that
sweeping
wave
of
fire
he
could
not
have
gone
five
miles
toward
home
before
he
met
the
flames
he
stood
in
the
stirrups
and
shook
his
fists
impotently
he
strained
his
eyes
to
see
what
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
see
his
ranch
and
val
and
how
they
had
fared
he
pictured
mentally
the
guard
he
had
burned
beyond
the
coulee
to
protect
them
from
just
this
danger
and
his
heart
squeezed
tight
at
the
realization
of
his
own
shiftlessness
that
guard
a
strip
of
sod
with
tufts
of
grass
left
standing
here
and
there
and
he
had
meant
to
burn
it
wider
and
had
put
it
off
from
day
to
day
until
now
his
clenched
fist
dropped
upon
the
saddle
horn
and
he
stared
dully
at
the
rushing
rolling
smoke
and
fire
it
was
not
he
saw
it
was
val
with
ruffles
grimy
face
and
yellow
hair
falling
in
loose
locks
upon
her
cheeks
locks
which
she
must
stop
to
push
out
of
her
eyes
so
that
she
could
see
where
to
swing
the
sodden
sack
while
she
helped
him
him
manley
who
had
permitted
her
to
do
work
it
for
none
but
a
hard
muscles
so
that
he
might
finish
the
sooner
and
ride
to
town
upon
some
flimsy
pretext
and
he
could
not
even
reach
her
now
or
the
place
where
she
had
been
the
group
had
thinned
around
him
for
there
was
something
to
do
besides
give
sympathy
to
a
man
bereaved
unless
they
bestirred
themselves
they
might
all
be
in
need
of
sympathy
before
the
day
was
done
manley
took
his
eyes
from
the
coming
fire
and
glanced
around
him
saw
that
he
was
alone
and
with
a
despairing
oath
wheeled
his
horse
and
raced
back
down
the
hill
to
town
as
if
fiends
rode
behind
the
saddle
at
the
saloon
opposite
the
hawley
hotel
he
drew
up
rather
his
horse
stopped
there
of
his
own
accord
as
if
he
were
quite
at
home
at
that
particular
hitching
pole
manley
dismounted
heavily
and
lurched
inside
the
place
was
deserted
save
for
jim
who
was
paid
to
watch
the
wares
of
his
employer
and
was
now
standing
upon
a
chair
at
the
window
that
he
might
see
over
the
top
of
hawley
coal
shed
and
glimpse
the
hilltop
beyond
jim
stepped
down
and
came
toward
him
how
the
fire
he
demanded
anxiously
think
she
swing
over
this
way
but
manley
had
sunk
into
a
chair
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
folded
upon
a
card
table
val
my
val
he
wailed
back
there
alone
get
me
a
drink
he
added
thickly
or
i
go
crazy
jim
hastily
poured
a
full
glass
and
stood
over
him
anxiously
here
it
is
drink
down
and
brace
up
what
you
mean
is
your
wife
manley
lifted
his
head
long
enough
to
gulp
the
whisky
then
dropped
it
again
upon
his
arms
and
groaned
chapter
ix
kent
to
the
rescue
the
fire
had
been
burning
a
possible
when
kent
jogging
aimlessly
toward
a
log
ridge
with
the
lazy
notion
of
riding
to
the
top
and
taking
a
look
at
the
country
to
the
west
before
returning
to
the
ranch
first
smelled
the
stronger
tang
of
burned
grass
and
swung
instinctively
into
the
wind
he
galloped
to
higher
ground
and
trained
by
long
watching
of
the
prairie
to
detect
the
smoke
of
a
nearer
fire
in
the
haze
of
those
long
distant
saw
at
once
what
must
have
happened
and
knew
also
the
danger
his
horse
was
fresh
and
he
raced
him
over
the
uneven
prairie
toward
the
blaze
it
was
tearing
straight
across
the
high
ground
between
dry
creek
and
cold
spring
coulee
when
he
first
saw
it
plainly
and
he
altered
his
course
a
trifle
the
roar
of
it
came
faintly
on
the
wind
like
the
sound
of
surf
pounding
heavily
upon
a
sand
bar
when
the
tide
is
out
except
that
this
roar
was
continuous
and
was
full
of
sharp
cracklings
and
sputterings
and
there
was
also
the
red
line
of
flame
to
visualize
the
sound
when
his
eyes
first
swept
the
blaze
he
felt
his
helplessness
and
cursed
aloud
the
man
who
had
drawn
all
the
fighting
force
from
the
prairie
that
day
they
might
at
least
have
been
able
to
harry
it
and
hamper
it
and
turn
the
savage
sweep
of
it
into
barren
ground
upon
some
coulee
rim
if
they
could
have
caught
it
at
the
start
or
even
in
the
first
mile
of
its
burning
or
even
now
if
blumenthall
outfit
were
on
the
spot
or
if
manley
fleetwood
fire
guards
held
it
back
he
hoped
some
of
them
had
stayed
at
home
so
that
they
could
help
fight
it
in
that
brief
glimpse
before
he
rode
down
into
a
hollow
and
so
lost
sight
of
it
he
knew
that
the
fire
they
had
fought
and
vanquished
before
had
been
a
puny
blaze
compared
with
this
one
the
ground
it
had
burned
was
not
broad
enough
to
do
more
than
check
this
fire
temporarily
it
would
simply
burn
around
the
blackened
area
and
rush
on
and
on
until
the
bend
of
the
river
turned
it
back
to
the
north
where
the
river
first
tributary
stream
would
stop
it
for
good
and
all
but
before
that
happened
it
would
have
done
its
worst
and
its
worst
was
enough
to
pale
the
face
of
every
prairie
dweller
once
more
he
caught
sight
of
the
fire
as
he
was
riding
swiftly
across
the
level
land
to
the
east
of
cold
spring
coulee
he
was
going
to
see
if
manley
fire
guards
were
any
good
and
if
anyone
was
there
ready
to
fight
it
when
it
came
up
they
could
set
a
back
fire
from
the
guards
he
thought
even
if
the
guards
themselves
were
not
wide
enough
to
hold
the
main
fire
he
pounded
heavily
down
the
long
trail
into
the
coulee
passed
close
by
the
house
with
a
glance
sidelong
to
see
if
anybody
was
in
sight
there
rounded
the
corral
to
follow
the
trail
which
wound
zigzag
up
the
farther
coulee
wall
and
overtook
val
running
bareheaded
up
the
hill
dragging
a
wet
sack
after
her
she
was
panting
already
from
the
climb
and
she
had
on
thin
slippers
with
high
heels
he
noticed
that
impeded
her
progress
and
promised
a
sprained
ankle
before
she
reached
the
top
kent
laughed
grimly
when
he
overtook
her
he
thought
it
was
like
a
child
running
with
a
cup
of
water
to
put
out
a
burning
house
where
do
you
think
you
going
with
that
sack
he
called
out
by
way
of
greeting
she
turned
a
pale
terrified
face
toward
him
and
reached
up
a
hand
mechanically
to
push
her
fair
hair
out
of
her
eyes
so
much
smoke
was
rolling
into
the
coulee
she
panted
and
i
knew
there
must
be
a
fire
and
i
never
felt
quite
easy
about
our
guards
since
polycarp
jenks
said
do
you
know
where
it
is
the
fire
it
between
here
and
the
railroad
give
me
that
sack
and
you
go
on
back
to
the
house
you
ca
do
any
and
when
she
handed
the
sack
up
to
him
and
then
kept
on
up
the
hill
he
became
autocratic
in
his
tone
go
on
back
to
the
house
i
tell
you
i
shall
not
do
anything
of
the
kind
she
retorted
indignantly
and
kent
gave
a
snort
of
disapproval
kicked
his
horse
into
a
lunging
gallop
and
left
her
you
spoil
your
complexion
he
cried
over
his
shoulder
and
about
all
you
will
do
you
better
go
back
and
get
a
val
did
not
attempt
to
reply
but
she
refused
to
let
his
taunts
turn
her
back
and
kept
stubbornly
climbing
though
tears
of
pure
rage
filled
her
eyes
and
even
slipped
over
the
lids
to
her
cheeks
before
she
had
reached
the
top
he
was
charging
down
upon
her
again
and
the
pallor
of
his
face
told
her
much
all
hell
could
stop
that
fire
he
cried
before
he
was
near
her
and
the
words
were
barely
distinguishable
in
the
roar
which
was
growing
louder
and
more
terrifying
get
back
you
want
to
stand
there
till
it
comes
down
on
you
then
just
as
he
was
passing
he
saw
how
white
and
trembling
she
was
and
he
pulled
up
with
michael
sliding
his
front
feet
in
the
loose
soil
that
he
might
stop
on
that
steep
slope
you
do
want
to
go
and
faint
he
remonstrated
in
a
more
kindly
tone
vaguely
conscious
that
he
had
perhaps
seemed
brutal
here
give
me
your
hand
and
stick
your
toe
in
the
stirrup
ah
do
waste
time
trying
to
make
up
your
mind
up
you
come
do
you
want
to
save
the
house
and
corrals
and
the
haystacks
we
got
our
work
cut
out
let
me
tell
you
if
we
do
he
had
leaned
and
lifted
her
up
bodily
helped
her
to
put
her
foot
in
the
stirrup
from
which
he
had
drawn
his
own
and
he
held
her
beside
him
while
he
sent
michael
down
the
trail
as
fast
as
he
dared
it
was
a
good
deal
of
a
nuisance
having
to
look
after
her
when
seconds
were
so
precious
but
he
could
go
on
and
leave
her
though
she
might
easily
have
reached
the
bottom
as
soon
as
he
if
she
had
not
been
so
frightened
he
was
afraid
to
trust
her
she
looked
to
him
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
in
his
arms
you
do
want
to
get
scared
he
said
as
calmly
as
he
could
it
back
two
or
three
miles
on
the
bench
yet
and
i
guess
we
can
easy
stop
it
from
burning
anything
but
the
grass
it
this
wind
you
see
manley
went
to
town
i
suppose
yes
she
answered
weakly
he
went
yesterday
and
stayed
over
i
all
alone
and
i
did
know
what
to
do
only
to
go
up
and
try
no
use
up
they
were
at
the
corral
gate
then
and
he
set
her
down
carefully
then
dismounted
and
turned
michael
into
the
corral
and
shut
the
gate
if
we
ca
step
it
and
i
ai
close
by
i
wish
you
let
michael
out
he
said
hurriedly
his
eyes
taking
in
the
immediate
surroundings
and
measuring
the
danger
which
lurked
in
weeds
grass
and
scattered
hay
a
horse
do
have
much
show
when
he
shut
up
and
out
there
where
that
dry
ditch
runs
we
you
take
this
sack
and
come
and
watch
out
my
fire
do
jump
the
ditch
we
carry
it
around
the
house
just
the
other
side
the
he
was
pulling
a
handful
of
grass
for
a
torch
and
while
he
was
twisting
it
and
feeling
in
his
pocket
for
a
match
he
looked
at
her
keenly
you
are
going
to
get
hysterics
and
leave
me
to
fight
it
alone
are
you
he
challenged
i
hope
i
not
quite
such
a
silly
she
answered
stiffly
and
he
smiled
to
himself
as
he
ran
along
the
far
side
of
the
ditch
with
his
blazing
tuft
of
grass
setting
fire
to
the
tangled
brown
mat
which
covered
the
coulee
bottom
val
followed
slowly
behind
him
watching
that
the
blaze
did
not
blow
back
across
the
ditch
and
beating
it
out
when
it
seemed
likely
to
do
so
now
that
she
could
actually
do
something
she
was
no
more
excited
than
he
if
one
could
judge
by
her
manner
she
did
look
sulky
however
at
his
way
of
treating
her
to
on
short
notice
with
no
furrow
of
moist
earth
but
only
a
shallow
little
dry
ditch
with
the
grass
almost
meeting
over
its
top
in
places
is
ticklish
business
at
best
kent
went
slowly
stamping
out
incipient
blazes
that
seemed
likely
to
turn
unruly
and
not
trusting
val
any
more
than
he
was
compelled
to
do
she
was
a
woman
and
experience
with
women
of
her
particular
type
had
not
been
extensive
enough
to
breed
confidence
in
an
emergency
like
this
he
had
no
more
than
finished
stringing
his
line
of
fire
in
the
irregular
half
circle
which
enclosed
house
corral
stables
and
haystacks
and
had
for
its
eastern
half
the
muddy
depression
which
in
seasons
less
dry
was
a
creek
fed
by
the
spring
when
a
jagged
line
of
fire
with
an
upper
wall
of
tumbling
brown
smoke
leaped
into
view
at
the
top
of
the
bluff
one
thing
was
in
his
favor
the
grass
upon
the
hillside
was
scantier
than
on
the
level
upland
and
here
and
there
were
patches
of
yellow
soil
absolutely
bare
of
vegetation
where
a
fire
would
be
compelled
to
halt
and
creep
slowly
around
also
fire
usually
burns
slower
down
a
hill
than
over
a
level
on
the
other
hand
the
long
seamlike
depressions
which
ran
to
the
top
were
filled
with
dry
brush
and
even
the
coulee
bottom
had
clumps
of
rosebushes
and
wild
currant
where
the
flames
would
revel
briefly
but
already
the
black
smoking
line
which
curved
around
the
haystacks
to
the
north
and
around
the
house
toward
the
south
was
widening
with
every
passing
second
val
had
a
tub
half
filled
with
water
at
the
house
and
that
helped
amazingly
by
making
it
possible
to
keep
the
sacks
wet
so
that
every
blow
counted
as
they
beat
out
the
ragged
tongues
of
flame
which
in
that
wind
would
jump
here
and
there
the
ditch
and
the
road
and
go
creeping
back
toward
the
stacks
and
the
buildings
for
it
was
a
long
line
they
were
guarding
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
running
up
and
down
in
their
endeavor
to
be
in
two
places
at
once
then
val
in
turning
to
strike
a
flame
behind
her
swept
her
skirt
across
a
tuft
of
smoldering
grass
and
set
herself
afire
with
the
excitement
of
watching
all
points
at
once
and
with
the
smoke
and
smell
of
fire
all
about
her
she
did
not
see
what
had
happened
and
must
have
paid
a
frightful
penalty
if
kent
had
not
at
that
moment
been
running
past
her
to
reach
a
point
where
a
blaze
had
jumped
the
ditch
he
swerved
and
swung
a
newly
wet
sack
around
her
with
a
force
which
would
have
knocked
her
down
if
he
had
not
at
the
same
time
caught
and
held
her
val
screamed
and
struggled
in
his
arms
and
kent
knew
that
it
was
of
him
she
was
afraid
as
soon
as
he
dared
he
released
her
and
backed
away
sullenly
sorry
i
did
have
time
to
say
please
you
were
just
ready
to
go
up
in
smoke
he
flung
savagely
over
his
shoulder
but
he
found
himself
shaking
and
weak
so
that
when
he
reached
the
blaze
he
must
beat
out
the
sack
was
heavy
as
lead
afraid
of
women
sure
do
beat
hell
he
told
himself
when
he
was
a
bit
steadier
he
glanced
back
at
her
resentfully
val
was
stooping
inspecting
the
damage
done
to
her
dress
she
stood
up
looked
at
him
and
he
saw
that
her
face
was
white
again
as
it
had
been
upon
the
hillside
a
moment
later
he
was
near
her
again
mr
burnett
i
ashamed
but
i
did
know
and
you
you
startled
me
she
stopped
him
long
enough
to
confess
though
she
did
not
meet
his
eyes
you
saved
you
be
startled
worse
if
you
let
the
fire
hang
there
in
that
bunch
of
grass
he
interrupted
coolly
behind
you
she
turned
obediently
and
swung
her
sack
down
several
times
upon
a
smoldering
spot
and
the
incident
was
closed
speedily
it
was
forgotten
also
for
with
the
meeting
of
the
fires
which
they
stood
still
to
watch
a
patch
of
wild
rosebushes
was
caught
fairly
upon
both
sides
and
flared
high
with
a
great
snapping
and
crackling
the
wind
seized
upon
the
blaze
flung
it
toward
them
like
a
great
yellow
banner
and
swept
cinders
and
burning
twigs
far
out
over
the
blackened
path
of
the
back
fire
kent
watched
it
and
hardly
breathed
but
val
was
shielding
her
face
from
the
searing
heat
with
her
arms
and
so
did
not
see
what
happened
then
a
burning
branch
like
a
long
flaming
dagger
flew
straight
with
the
wind
and
lighted
true
as
if
flung
by
the
hand
of
an
enemy
a
long
neatly
tapered
stack
received
it
fairly
and
kent
cry
brought
val
arms
down
and
her
scared
eyes
staring
at
him
that
settles
the
hay
he
exclaimed
and
raced
for
the
stacks
knowing
all
the
while
that
he
could
do
nothing
and
yet
panting
in
his
hurry
to
reach
the
spot
michael
trampling
uneasily
in
the
corral
lifted
his
head
and
neighed
shrilly
as
kent
passed
him
on
the
run
michael
had
watched
fearfully
the
fire
sweeping
down
upon
him
and
his
fear
had
troubled
val
not
a
little
when
she
saw
kent
pass
the
gate
she
hurried
up
and
threw
it
open
wondering
a
little
that
kent
should
forget
his
horse
he
had
told
her
to
see
that
he
was
turned
loose
if
the
fire
could
not
be
stopped
and
now
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
it
michael
with
a
snort
and
an
upward
toss
of
his
head
to
throw
the
dragging
reins
away
from
his
feet
left
the
corral
with
one
jump
and
clattered
away
past
the
house
and
up
the
hill
on
the
trail
which
led
toward
home
val
stood
for
a
moment
watching
him
could
he
the
fire
he
was
holding
his
head
turned
to
one
side
now
so
that
the
reins
dangled
away
from
his
pounding
feet
once
he
stumbled
to
his
knees
but
he
was
up
in
a
flash
and
running
faster
than
ever
he
passed
out
of
sight
over
the
hill
and
val
with
eyes
smarting
and
cheeks
burning
from
the
heat
drew
a
long
breath
and
started
after
kent
kent
was
backing
step
by
step
away
from
the
heat
of
the
burning
stacks
the
roar
and
the
crackle
and
the
heat
were
terrific
it
was
as
if
the
whole
world
was
burning
around
them
and
they
only
were
left
a
brand
flew
low
over
val
head
as
she
ran
staggeringly
with
a
bewildered
sense
that
she
must
hurry
somewhere
and
do
something
immediately
to
save
something
which
positively
must
be
saved
a
spark
from
the
brand
fell
upon
her
hand
and
she
looked
up
stupidly
the
heat
and
the
smoke
were
choking
her
so
that
she
could
scarcely
breathe
a
new
crackle
was
added
to
the
uproar
of
flames
kent
still
backing
from
the
furnace
of
blazing
hay
turned
and
saw
that
the
stable
with
its
roof
of
musty
hay
was
afire
and
just
beyond
val
her
face
covered
with
her
sooty
hands
was
staggering
drunkenly
he
reached
her
as
she
fell
to
her
knees
i
ca
fight
any
more
she
whispered
faintly
he
picked
her
up
in
his
arms
and
hesitated
his
face
toward
the
house
then
ran
straight
away
from
it
stumbled
across
the
dry
ditch
and
out
across
the
blackened
strip
which
their
own
back
fire
had
swept
clean
of
grass
the
hot
earth
burned
his
feet
through
the
soles
of
his
riding
boots
but
the
wind
carried
the
heat
and
the
smoke
away
behind
them
clumps
of
bushes
were
still
burning
at
the
roots
but
he
avoided
them
and
kept
on
to
the
far
side
hill
where
a
barren
yellow
patch
with
jutting
sandstone
rocks
offered
a
resting
place
he
set
val
down
upon
a
rock
placed
himself
beside
her
so
that
she
was
leaning
against
him
and
began
fanning
her
vigorously
with
his
hat
thank
the
lord
we
behind
that
smoke
anyhow
he
observed
when
he
could
get
his
breath
he
felt
that
silence
was
not
good
for
the
woman
beside
him
though
he
doubted
much
whether
she
was
in
a
condition
to
understand
him
she
was
gasping
irregularly
and
her
body
was
a
dead
weight
against
him
it
was
sure
fierce
there
for
a
few
he
looked
out
across
the
coulee
at
the
burning
stables
and
waited
for
the
house
to
catch
he
could
not
hope
that
it
would
escape
but
he
did
not
mention
the
probability
of
its
burning
keep
your
eyes
shut
he
said
that
help
some
and
soon
as
we
can
we
go
to
the
spring
and
give
our
faces
and
hands
a
good
he
untied
his
silk
neckerchief
shook
out
the
cinders
and
pressed
it
against
her
closed
eyes
keep
that
over
he
commanded
till
we
can
do
better
my
eyes
are
more
used
to
smoke
than
yours
i
guess
working
around
branding
fires
toughens
still
she
did
not
attempt
to
speak
and
she
did
not
seem
to
have
energy
enough
left
to
keep
the
silk
over
her
eyes
the
wind
blew
it
off
without
her
stirring
a
finger
to
prevent
and
kent
caught
it
just
in
time
to
save
it
from
sailing
away
toward
the
fire
after
that
he
held
it
in
place
himself
and
he
did
not
try
to
keep
talking
he
sat
quietly
with
his
arm
around
her
as
impersonal
in
the
embrace
as
if
he
were
holding
a
strange
partner
in
a
dance
and
watched
the
stacks
burn
and
the
stables
he
saw
the
corral
take
fire
rail
by
rail
until
it
was
all
ablaze
he
saw
hens
and
roosters
running
heavily
with
wings
dragging
until
the
heat
toppled
them
over
he
saw
a
cat
with
white
spots
upon
its
sides
leave
the
bushes
down
by
the
creek
and
go
bounding
in
terror
to
the
house
and
still
the
house
stood
there
the
curtains
flapping
in
and
out
through
the
open
windows
the
kitchen
door
banging
open
and
shut
as
the
gusts
of
wind
caught
it
the
fire
licked
as
close
as
burned
ground
and
rocky
creek
bed
would
let
it
and
the
flames
which
had
stayed
behind
to
eat
the
spare
gleanings
died
while
the
main
line
raged
on
up
the
hillside
and
disappeared
in
a
huge
curling
wave
of
smoke
the
stacks
burned
down
to
blackened
smoldering
butts
the
willows
next
the
spring
and
the
chokecherries
and
wild
currants
withered
in
the
heat
and
waved
charred
naked
arms
impotently
in
the
wind
the
stable
crumpled
up
flared
and
became
a
heap
of
embers
the
corral
was
but
a
ragged
line
of
smoking
sticks
and
ashes
spirals
of
smoke
like
dying
camp
fires
blew
thin
ribbons
out
over
the
desolation
kent
drew
a
long
breath
and
glanced
down
at
the
limp
figure
in
his
arms
she
lay
so
very
still
that
in
spite
of
a
quivering
breath
now
and
then
he
had
a
swift
unreasoning
fear
she
might
be
dead
her
hair
was
a
tangled
mass
of
gold
upon
her
head
and
spilled
over
his
arm
he
carefully
picked
a
flake
or
two
of
charred
grass
from
the
locks
on
her
temples
and
discovered
how
fine
and
soft
was
the
hair
he
lifted
the
grimy
neckerchief
from
her
eyes
and
looked
down
at
her
face
and
reddened
from
the
heat
her
lips
were
drooped
pitifully
like
a
hurt
child
her
lashes
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
were
at
least
four
shades
darker
than
her
hair
his
gaze
traveled
on
down
her
slim
figure
to
her
ringed
fingers
lying
loosely
in
her
lap
a
long
blister
upon
one
hand
near
the
thumb
down
to
her
slippers
showing
beneath
her
scorched
skirt
and
he
drew
another
long
breath
he
did
not
know
why
but
he
had
a
strange
fleeting
sense
of
possession
and
it
startled
him
into
action
you
gone
to
sleep
he
called
gently
and
gave
her
a
little
shake
we
can
get
to
the
spring
now
if
you
feel
like
walking
that
far
if
you
do
i
reckon
i
have
to
carry
you
for
i
sure
do
want
a
drink
she
half
lifted
her
lashes
and
let
them
drop
again
as
if
life
were
not
worth
the
effort
of
living
kent
hesitated
set
his
lips
tightly
together
and
lifted
her
up
straighter
his
eyes
were
intent
and
stern
as
though
some
great
issue
was
at
stake
and
he
must
rouse
her
at
once
in
spite
of
everything
here
this
wo
do
at
all
he
said
but
he
was
speaking
to
himself
and
his
quivering
nerves
more
than
to
her
she
sighed
made
a
conscious
effort
and
half
opened
her
eyes
again
but
she
seemed
not
to
share
his
anxiety
for
action
and
her
mental
and
physical
apathy
were
not
to
be
mistaken
the
girl
was
utterly
exhausted
with
and
nervous
strain
you
seem
to
be
all
in
he
observed
his
voice
softly
complaining
well
i
packed
you
over
here
and
i
reckon
i
better
pack
you
back
again
if
you
try
to
she
muttered
something
of
which
kent
only
distinguished
a
but
she
was
still
limp
and
absolutely
without
interest
in
anything
and
so
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
he
gathered
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
back
to
the
house
kicked
the
door
savagely
open
took
her
in
through
the
kitchen
and
laid
her
down
upon
the
couch
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
he
was
rid
of
her
the
couch
was
gay
with
a
bright
silk
spread
of
crazy
patchwork
and
piled
generously
with
dainty
cushions
too
evidently
made
for
ornamental
purposes
than
for
use
but
kent
piled
the
cushions
recklessly
around
her
tucked
her
smudgy
skirts
close
went
and
got
a
towel
which
he
immersed
recklessly
in
the
water
pail
and
bathed
her
face
and
hands
with
clumsy
gentleness
and
pushed
back
her
tangled
hair
the
burn
upon
her
hand
showed
an
angry
red
around
the
white
of
the
blister
and
he
laid
the
wet
towel
carefully
upon
it
she
did
not
move
he
was
a
man
and
he
had
lived
all
his
life
among
men
he
could
fight
anything
that
was
fightable
he
could
save
her
life
but
after
this
slight
attention
to
her
comfort
he
had
reached
the
limitations
set
by
his
purely
masculine
training
he
lowered
the
shades
so
that
the
room
was
dusky
and
as
cool
as
any
other
place
in
that
land
and
felt
that
he
could
no
do
more
for
her
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
inert
grimy
little
figure
stretched
out
straight
like
a
corpse
upon
the
couch
her
eyes
closed
and
sunken
with
blue
shadows
beneath
her
lips
pale
and
still
with
that
tired
pitiful
droop
he
stooped
and
rearranged
the
wet
towel
on
her
burned
hand
held
his
face
close
above
hers
for
a
second
sighed
frowned
and
tiptoed
out
into
the
kitchen
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
chapter
desolation
for
more
than
two
hours
kent
sat
outside
in
the
shade
of
the
house
and
stared
out
over
the
black
desolation
of
the
coulee
his
horse
was
gone
so
that
he
could
not
ride
anywhere
and
there
was
nowhere
in
particular
to
ride
for
twenty
miles
around
there
was
no
woman
whom
he
could
bring
to
val
assistance
even
if
he
had
been
sure
that
she
needed
assistance
several
times
he
tiptoed
into
the
kitchen
opened
the
door
into
the
front
room
an
inch
or
so
and
peered
in
at
her
the
third
time
she
had
relaxed
from
the
corpselike
position
and
had
thrown
an
arm
up
over
her
face
as
if
she
were
shielding
her
eyes
from
something
he
took
heart
at
that
and
went
out
and
foraged
for
firewood
there
was
a
zone
around
the
corral
and
stables
which
had
kept
the
fire
from
spreading
toward
the
house
and
the
wind
had
borne
the
sparks
and
embers
back
toward
the
spring
so
that
the
house
stood
in
a
brown
oasis
of
unburned
grass
and
weeds
scanty
enough
it
is
true
but
yet
a
relief
from
the
dead
black
surroundings
the
woodpile
had
not
suffered
a
chopping
block
a
decrepit
sawhorse
an
axe
and
a
rusty
bucksaw
marked
the
spot
also
three
ties
hacked
eloquently
in
places
and
just
five
sticks
of
wood
evidently
chopped
from
a
tie
by
a
man
in
haste
kent
looked
at
that
woodpile
and
swore
he
had
always
known
that
manley
had
an
aversion
to
laboring
with
his
hands
but
he
was
unprepared
for
such
an
exhibition
of
shiftlessness
he
savagely
attacked
the
three
ties
chopped
them
into
firewood
and
piled
them
neatly
and
then
walking
upon
his
toes
he
made
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
stove
filled
the
woodbox
the
teakettle
and
the
water
pail
sat
out
in
the
shade
until
he
heard
the
kettle
boiling
over
on
the
stove
took
another
peep
in
at
val
and
then
moving
as
quietly
as
he
could
proceeded
to
cook
supper
for
them
both
he
had
been
perfectly
familiar
with
the
kitchen
arrangements
in
the
days
when
manley
was
a
bachelor
and
it
interested
him
and
filled
him
with
a
respectful
admiration
for
woman
in
the
abstract
and
for
val
in
particular
to
see
how
changed
everything
was
and
how
daintily
clean
and
orderly
val
smooth
white
hands
with
their
two
sparkly
rings
and
the
broad
wedding
band
did
not
suggest
a
familiarity
with
actual
work
about
a
house
but
the
effect
of
her
labor
and
thought
confronted
him
at
every
turn
you
can
see
your
face
in
everything
you
pick
up
that
was
made
to
shine
he
commented
standing
for
a
moment
while
he
surveyed
the
bottom
of
a
stewpan
she
do
look
it
but
that
little
dame
sure
knows
how
to
keep
then
he
heard
her
cough
and
set
down
the
stewpan
hurriedly
and
went
to
see
if
she
wanted
anything
val
was
sitting
upon
the
couch
her
two
hands
pushing
back
her
hair
gazing
stupidly
around
her
everything
all
ready
but
the
tea
kent
announced
in
a
perfectly
tone
i
was
just
waiting
to
see
how
strong
you
want
val
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
in
bewilderment
why
burnett
maybe
i
was
dreaming
then
i
thought
there
was
a
fire
was
there
kent
grinned
kinda
you
worked
like
a
son
of
a
gun
too
till
there
was
any
more
to
do
and
then
you
laid
down
for
fair
you
were
all
in
so
i
packed
you
in
and
put
you
there
where
you
could
be
comfortable
and
supper
ready
but
how
strong
do
you
want
your
tea
i
kinda
had
an
idea
he
added
lamely
that
women
drink
tea
mostly
i
made
coffee
for
val
let
herself
drop
back
among
the
pretty
pillows
i
do
want
any
if
there
was
a
fire
she
said
dully
then
it
true
everything
all
burned
up
i
do
want
any
tea
i
want
to
die
kent
studied
her
for
a
moment
well
in
that
case
shall
i
get
the
axe
val
had
closed
her
eyes
but
she
opened
them
again
i
do
care
what
you
do
she
said
well
i
aim
to
please
he
told
her
calmly
what
do
in
your
place
would
be
to
go
and
put
on
something
that
ai
all
smoked
and
scorched
like
a
a
ham
and
then
i
sit
up
and
drink
some
tea
and
be
nice
about
it
but
of
course
if
you
want
to
cash
in
val
gave
a
sob
i
ca
help
it
i
just
as
soon
be
dead
as
alive
it
was
bad
enough
before
and
now
everything
burned
up
and
all
nice
well
kent
interrupted
mercilessly
i
heard
of
women
doing
all
kinds
of
fool
things
but
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
one
to
commit
suicide
over
a
couple
of
measly
haystacks
he
went
out
and
slammed
the
door
so
that
the
house
shook
and
tramped
three
times
across
the
kitchen
floor
that
make
her
so
mad
at
me
she
wo
think
about
anything
else
for
a
while
he
reasoned
shrewdly
but
all
the
while
his
eyes
were
shiny
and
when
he
winked
his
lashes
became
unaccountably
moist
he
stopped
and
looked
out
at
the
blackened
coulee
shut
into
this
hole
week
after
week
without
a
woman
to
speak
to
it
must
be
damned
tough
he
muttered
he
tiptoed
up
and
laid
his
ear
against
the
inner
door
and
heard
a
smothered
sobbing
inside
that
did
not
sound
as
if
she
were
mad
and
he
promptly
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
and
a
brute
with
his
own
judgment
to
guide
him
he
brewed
some
very
creditable
tea
sugared
and
creamed
it
lavishly
browned
a
slice
of
bread
on
top
of
the
stove
blowing
off
the
dust
beforehand
after
arline
recipe
for
making
toast
buttered
it
until
it
dripped
oil
and
carried
it
in
to
her
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
will
have
peace
even
though
he
must
fight
for
it
the
forlorn
picture
she
made
lying
there
with
her
face
buried
in
a
cushion
and
with
her
shoulders
shaking
with
sobs
almost
made
him
retreat
quite
unnerved
as
it
was
he
merely
spilled
a
third
of
the
tea
and
just
missed
letting
the
toast
slide
from
the
plate
to
the
floor
when
he
had
righted
his
burden
he
had
recovered
his
composure
to
a
degree
here
this
wo
do
at
all
he
reproved
pulling
a
chair
to
the
couch
by
the
simple
method
of
hooking
his
toe
under
a
round
and
dragging
it
toward
him
you
do
want
man
to
come
and
catch
you
acting
like
this
liable
to
feel
pretty
blue
himself
and
he
need
some
cheering
up
you
think
i
do
know
for
sure
but
i
always
been
kinda
under
the
impression
that
what
a
man
gets
a
wife
for
ai
it
you
do
want
to
throw
down
your
cards
now
you
sit
up
and
drink
this
tea
and
eat
this
toast
and
i
gamble
you
feel
about
two
hundred
per
cent
better
come
he
urged
gently
after
a
minute
i
never
thought
a
nervy
little
woman
like
you
would
give
up
so
easy
i
was
plumb
ashamed
of
myself
the
way
you
worked
on
that
back
fire
you
had
me
going
for
a
while
just
tired
out
is
all
ails
you
you
want
to
hurry
up
and
drink
this
before
it
gets
cold
come
on
i
liable
to
feel
insulted
if
you
pass
up
my
cooking
this
val
choked
back
the
tears
and
without
taking
her
face
from
the
pillow
put
out
the
burned
hand
gropingly
until
it
touched
his
knee
oh
you
you
good
she
said
brokenly
i
used
to
think
you
were
horrid
and
i
a
ashamed
you
good
and
i
well
i
ai
going
to
be
good
much
longer
if
you
do
get
your
head
outa
that
pillow
and
drink
this
tea
his
tone
was
amused
and
half
impatient
but
his
face
more
particularly
his
eyes
told
another
story
which
perhaps
it
was
as
well
she
did
not
read
i
be
dropping
the
blamed
stuff
in
another
minute
my
elbow
plumb
getting
a
cramp
in
it
he
added
complainingly
val
made
a
sound
between
a
sob
and
a
laugh
and
sat
up
with
more
haste
than
the
occasion
warranted
kent
put
the
tea
and
toast
on
the
chair
and
started
for
the
kitchen
i
was
bound
you
eat
before
i
did
he
explained
and
i
could
stand
a
cup
of
coffee
myself
and
say
if
there
anything
more
you
want
just
holler
and
i
come
on
the
long
val
took
up
the
teaspoon
tasted
the
tea
and
then
regarded
the
cup
doubtfully
she
never
drank
sugar
in
her
tea
she
wondered
how
much
of
it
he
had
put
in
her
head
ached
frightfully
and
she
felt
weak
and
utterly
hopeless
of
ever
feeling
different
everything
all
right
came
kent
voice
from
the
kitchen
yes
val
answered
hastily
trying
hard
to
speak
with
some
life
and
cheer
in
her
tone
it
lovely
all
of
want
more
tea
it
sounded
out
there
as
though
he
was
pushing
back
his
chair
to
rise
from
the
table
no
no
this
is
val
glanced
fearfully
toward
the
kitchen
door
lifted
the
teacup
and
heroically
drank
every
drop
it
was
she
considered
the
least
that
she
could
do
when
he
had
finished
eating
he
came
in
and
found
her
nibbling
apathetically
at
the
toast
she
looked
up
at
him
with
an
apology
in
her
eyes
mr
burnett
do
think
i
am
always
so
silly
she
began
leaning
back
against
the
piled
pillows
with
a
sigh
i
have
always
thought
that
i
could
bear
anything
but
last
night
i
did
sleep
much
i
dreamed
about
fires
and
that
manley
was
dead
and
i
woke
up
in
a
perfect
horror
it
was
only
ten
so
then
i
sat
up
and
tried
to
read
and
every
five
minutes
i
would
go
out
and
look
at
the
sky
to
see
if
there
was
a
glow
anywhere
it
was
foolish
of
course
and
i
did
sleep
at
all
either
the
minute
i
would
lie
down
i
imagine
i
heard
a
fire
roaring
and
then
it
came
but
i
was
all
used
up
before
that
so
i
was
really
i
must
have
fainted
for
i
do
remember
getting
into
the
house
and
i
do
think
fainting
is
the
silliest
thing
i
never
did
such
a
thing
before
she
finished
abjectly
oh
well
i
guess
you
had
a
license
to
faint
if
you
felt
that
way
he
comforted
awkwardly
it
was
the
smoke
and
the
heat
i
reckon
they
were
enough
to
put
a
crimp
in
anybody
did
man
say
about
when
he
would
be
back
because
i
ought
to
be
moving
along
it
quite
a
walk
to
the
oh
you
wo
go
till
manley
comes
please
i
i
go
crazy
here
alone
and
and
he
might
not
come
he
frequently
detained
i
i
such
a
horror
of
fires
she
certainly
looked
as
if
she
had
she
was
sitting
up
straight
her
hands
held
out
appealingly
to
him
her
eyes
big
and
bright
sure
i
wo
go
if
you
feel
that
way
about
kent
was
half
frightened
at
her
wild
manner
i
guess
man
will
be
along
pretty
soon
anyway
hit
the
trail
as
soon
as
he
can
get
behind
the
fire
that
a
cinch
be
worried
to
death
about
you
and
you
do
need
to
be
afraid
of
prairie
fires
any
more
fleetwood
you
safe
there
ca
be
any
more
fires
till
next
year
anyway
there
nothing
left
to
he
turned
his
face
to
the
window
and
stared
out
somberly
at
the
ravaged
hillside
yes
dead
safe
now
i
such
a
fool
val
confessed
her
eyes
also
turning
to
the
window
if
you
want
to
go
i
her
mouth
was
quivering
and
she
did
not
finish
the
sentence
oh
i
stay
till
man
comes
he
liable
to
be
along
any
time
he
glanced
at
her
scorched
dress
he
sure
think
you
made
a
hand
all
right
val
took
the
hint
and
blushed
with
true
feminine
shame
that
she
was
not
looking
her
best
i
go
and
change
she
murmured
and
rose
wearily
but
i
feel
as
if
the
world
had
been
up
in
a
scroll
and
burned
as
the
bible
puts
it
and
as
if
nothing
matters
any
it
does
though
we
all
go
right
along
living
the
same
as
ever
and
the
first
snow
will
make
this
fire
seem
as
old
as
the
war
except
to
the
cattle
they
the
ones
to
get
it
in
the
neck
this
he
went
out
and
walked
aimlessly
around
in
the
yard
and
went
over
to
the
smoking
remains
of
the
stable
and
to
the
heap
of
black
ashes
where
the
stacks
had
been
manley
would
be
hard
hit
he
knew
he
wished
he
would
hurry
and
come
and
relieve
him
of
the
responsibility
of
keeping
val
company
he
wondered
a
little
in
his
masculine
way
that
women
should
always
be
afraid
when
there
was
no
cause
for
fear
for
instance
she
had
stayed
alone
a
good
many
times
evidently
when
there
was
real
danger
of
a
fire
sweeping
down
upon
her
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
but
now
when
there
was
no
longer
a
possibility
of
anything
happening
she
had
turned
white
and
begged
him
to
stay
and
val
he
judged
shrewdly
was
not
the
sort
of
woman
who
finds
it
easy
to
beg
favors
of
anybody
there
came
a
sound
of
galloping
up
on
the
hill
and
he
turned
quickly
dull
dusk
was
settling
bleakly
down
upon
the
land
but
he
could
see
three
or
four
horsemen
just
making
the
first
descent
from
the
top
he
shouted
a
wordless
greeting
and
heard
their
answering
yells
in
another
minute
or
two
they
were
pulling
up
at
the
house
where
he
had
hurried
to
meet
them
val
tucking
a
side
comb
hastily
into
her
freshly
coiled
hair
her
pretty
self
clothed
all
in
white
linen
appeased
eagerly
in
the
doorway
why
where
manley
she
demanded
anxiously
blumenthall
was
dismounting
near
her
and
he
touched
his
hat
before
he
answered
we
were
on
the
way
home
and
we
thought
we
better
ride
around
this
way
and
see
how
you
came
out
he
evaded
i
see
you
lost
your
hay
and
buildings
pretty
close
call
for
the
house
too
i
should
judge
you
must
have
got
here
in
time
to
do
something
but
where
manley
val
was
growing
pale
again
has
anything
happened
is
he
hurt
tell
me
oh
he
all
right
blumenthall
glanced
meaningly
at
kent
and
fred
de
garmo
sitting
to
one
side
of
his
saddle
looked
at
polycarp
jenks
and
smiled
slightly
we
left
town
ahead
of
him
and
knocked
right
val
regarded
the
group
suspiciously
he
coming
then
is
he
oh
certainly
glad
you
all
right
fleetwood
that
was
an
awful
fire
it
swept
the
whole
country
clean
between
the
two
rivers
i
afraid
this
wind
made
it
he
was
tightening
his
cinch
and
now
he
unhooked
the
stirrup
from
the
horn
and
mounted
again
we
have
to
be
getting
along
do
know
yet
how
we
came
out
of
it
over
to
the
ranch
but
our
guards
ought
to
have
stopped
it
he
looked
at
kent
how
did
the
wishbone
make
it
he
inquired
i
was
just
going
to
ask
you
if
you
knew
kent
replied
scowling
because
he
saw
fred
looking
at
val
in
what
he
considered
an
impertinent
manner
my
horse
ran
off
while
i
was
fighting
fire
here
so
i
afoot
i
was
waiting
for
man
to
show
you
git
all
of
that
you
want
polycarp
cut
in
tactlessly
man
wo
git
home
not
unless
aw
come
fred
started
along
the
charred
trail
which
led
across
the
coulee
and
up
the
farther
side
blumenthall
spoke
a
last
commonplace
sentence
or
two
just
to
round
off
the
conversation
and
make
the
termination
not
too
abrupt
and
they
rode
away
with
polycarp
glancing
curiously
back
now
and
then
as
though
he
was
tempted
to
stay
and
gossip
and
yet
was
anxious
to
know
all
that
had
happened
at
the
double
diamond
what
did
polycarp
jenks
mean
about
manley
not
coming
val
was
standing
in
the
doorway
staring
after
the
group
of
horsemen
nothing
i
guess
polycarp
never
does
mean
anything
half
the
time
he
just
talks
to
hear
his
head
roar
man
come
all
right
this
bunch
happened
to
beat
him
out
is
oh
do
you
think
so
blumenthall
acted
as
if
there
was
something
well
what
can
you
expect
of
a
man
that
lives
on
oatmeal
mush
and
toast
and
hot
water
kent
demanded
aggressively
and
fred
de
garmo
is
always
grinning
and
winking
at
somebody
and
that
other
fellow
is
a
swede
and
got
about
as
much
sense
as
a
prairie
dog
and
polycarp
is
an
old
granny
gossip
that
nobody
ever
pays
any
attention
to
man
wo
stay
in
town
hell
be
too
it
terrible
sighed
val
about
the
hay
and
the
stables
manley
will
be
so
discouraged
he
worked
so
hard
to
cut
and
stack
that
hay
and
he
was
just
going
to
gather
the
calves
together
and
put
them
in
the
river
field
in
a
couple
of
weeks
and
now
there
is
anything
to
feed
them
i
guess
he
coming
i
hear
kent
was
straining
his
eyes
to
see
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
dismal
sight
shadows
lay
heavily
upon
the
dismal
black
earth
sounds
to
me
like
a
rig
though
maybe
he
drove
he
left
her
went
to
the
wire
gate
which
gave
egress
from
the
tiny
unkempt
yard
and
walked
along
the
trail
to
meet
the
newcomer
you
stay
there
he
called
back
when
he
thought
he
heard
val
following
him
i
just
going
to
tell
him
you
all
right
you
get
that
white
dress
all
smudged
up
in
these
in
the
narrow
little
gully
where
the
trail
crossed
the
channel
from
the
spring
he
met
the
rig
the
driver
pulled
up
when
he
caught
sight
of
kent
who
that
did
she
git
out
of
it
cried
arline
hawley
in
a
breathless
undertone
oh
it
you
is
it
kent
i
could
stand
it
i
just
had
to
come
and
see
if
she
alive
so
i
made
hank
hitch
right
up
as
soon
as
we
knew
the
fire
was
going
to
git
into
all
that
brush
along
the
creek
and
run
down
to
the
town
and
bring
me
over
and
the
way
but
where
man
kent
laid
a
hand
upon
the
wheel
and
shot
the
question
into
the
stream
of
arline
talk
man
i
dunno
what
devil
gits
into
men
sometimes
man
went
and
got
drunk
as
a
fool
soon
as
he
seen
the
fire
and
knew
what
coulda
happened
out
here
started
right
in
to
drownd
his
sorrows
before
he
made
sure
whether
he
had
any
to
drown
if
that
ai
like
a
man
every
time
time
we
all
got
back
to
town
and
the
fire
was
kiting
away
from
us
instead
of
coming
up
toward
us
he
was
too
drunk
to
do
anything
he
must
of
poured
it
down
him
by
the
quart
he
manley
is
that
you
dear
it
was
val
a
slim
white
figure
against
the
blackness
all
around
her
coming
down
the
trail
to
see
what
delayed
them
why
do
you
come
to
the
house
there
a
house
you
know
we
quite
burned
out
and
i
all
right
so
there
no
need
to
worry
any
now
ai
that
a
darned
shame
muttered
arline
wrathfully
to
kent
a
feller
that
drink
when
he
got
a
wife
like
that
had
oughta
be
hung
it
me
arline
hawley
she
raised
her
voice
to
its
ordinary
shrill
level
it
ai
just
the
proper
time
to
make
a
call
i
guess
but
better
late
than
never
man
he
was
took
with
one
of
his
spells
so
i
told
him
i
come
on
out
and
take
you
back
to
town
how
are
you
anyhow
scared
plumb
to
death
i
bet
when
that
fire
come
over
the
hill
you
tramped
clear
down
here
we
was
coming
on
to
the
house
in
a
minute
i
got
to
chewin
the
rag
with
kent
git
in
you
might
as
well
ride
back
to
the
house
now
you
manley
did
come
val
was
standing
beside
the
rig
near
kent
her
figure
was
indistinct
and
her
face
obscured
in
the
dark
her
voice
was
quiet
lifelessly
quiet
is
he
sick
well
of
course
has
nerves
was
all
upset
oh
then
he
sick
well
nothing
dangerous
but
he
was
feelin
well
so
i
thought
come
out
and
take
you
back
with
oh
man
was
awful
worried
you
must
think
he
was
he
was
pretty
near
crazy
for
a
oh
yes
get
in
and
ride
and
you
must
worry
none
about
man
nor
feel
hurt
that
he
did
come
he
felt
so
bad
i
walk
thank
you
it
only
a
few
steps
and
i
not
worried
at
all
i
quite
the
team
started
on
slowly
and
hawley
turned
in
the
seat
so
that
she
could
continue
talking
without
interruption
to
the
two
who
walked
behind
but
it
was
kent
who
answered
her
at
intervals
when
she
asked
a
direct
question
or
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
some
comment
betweenwhiles
he
was
wondering
if
val
did
after
all
understand
she
knew
so
little
of
the
west
and
its
ways
and
her
faith
in
manley
was
so
firm
and
unquestioning
that
he
felt
sure
she
was
only
hurt
at
what
looked
very
much
like
an
indifference
to
her
welfare
he
suspected
shrewdly
that
she
was
thinking
what
she
would
have
done
in
manley
place
and
was
trying
to
reconcile
hawley
assurances
that
manley
was
not
actually
sick
or
disabled
with
the
blunt
fact
that
he
had
stayed
in
town
and
permitted
others
to
come
out
to
see
if
she
were
alive
or
dead
and
kent
had
another
problem
to
solve
should
he
tell
her
the
truth
he
had
never
ceased
to
feel
in
some
measure
responsible
for
her
position
and
she
was
sure
to
discover
the
truth
before
long
not
even
her
innocence
and
her
ignorance
of
life
could
shield
her
from
that
knowledge
he
let
a
question
or
two
of
arline
go
unanswered
while
he
struggled
for
a
decision
but
when
they
reached
the
house
only
one
point
was
dearly
settled
in
his
mind
instead
of
riding
as
far
as
he
might
and
then
walking
across
the
prairie
to
the
wishbone
he
intended
to
go
on
to
town
with
them
to
see
her
through
with
chapter
xi
val
awakening
val
stood
just
inside
the
door
of
the
hotel
parlor
and
glanced
swiftly
around
at
the
place
of
unpleasant
memory
no
i
must
see
manley
before
i
can
tell
you
whether
we
shall
want
to
stay
or
not
she
replied
to
arline
insistence
that
she
go
right
up
to
a
room
and
lie
down
i
feel
quite
well
and
you
must
not
bother
about
me
at
all
if
burnett
will
be
good
enough
to
send
manley
to
me
i
must
see
him
first
of
it
was
val
in
her
most
unapproachable
mood
and
arline
subsided
before
it
well
then
i
go
and
send
word
to
man
and
see
about
some
supper
for
us
i
feel
as
if
could
eat
nails
she
went
out
into
the
hall
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
boldly
invaded
the
say
have
you
got
man
rounded
up
yit
she
demanded
of
her
husband
and
how
is
he
anyhow
that
girl
ai
got
the
first
idea
of
what
ails
him
how
anybody
with
the
brains
and
education
she
got
can
be
so
gits
me
jim
told
me
man
been
packing
a
bottle
or
two
home
with
him
every
trip
he
made
for
the
last
month
and
she
do
know
a
thing
about
it
i
like
to
know
what
time
they
learn
folks
back
east
anyhow
to
put
their
eyes
and
their
sense
in
their
pockets
i
guess
and
go
along
blind
as
bats
where
kent
at
did
he
go
after
him
she
wo
do
nothing
till
she
sees
man
at
that
moment
kent
came
in
and
his
disgust
needed
no
words
he
answered
hawley
inquiring
look
with
a
shake
of
the
head
i
ca
do
anything
with
him
he
said
morosely
he
so
full
he
know
he
got
a
wife
hardly
you
better
go
and
tell
her
hawley
somebody
got
oh
my
heavens
arline
clutched
at
the
doorknob
for
moral
support
i
could
no
more
face
them
yellow
eyes
of
hern
when
they
blaze
up
you
go
tell
her
yourself
if
you
want
her
told
i
got
to
see
about
some
supper
for
us
i
ai
had
a
bite
since
dinner
and
min
off
gadding
somewheres
she
hurried
away
mentally
washing
her
hands
of
the
affair
women
got
to
learn
some
time
what
men
is
she
soliloquized
and
i
guess
she
no
better
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
that
she
ca
learn
to
take
her
medicine
but
ai
goin
to
be
the
one
to
tell
her
what
kinda
fellow
she
tied
to
my
stunt
be
helpin
her
pick
up
the
pieces
and
make
the
best
of
it
after
she
she
stopped
just
inside
the
dining
room
and
listened
until
she
heard
kent
cross
the
hall
from
the
office
and
open
the
parlor
door
gee
it
like
a
hangin
she
sighed
if
she
was
so
plumb
innocent
she
started
for
the
door
which
opened
into
the
parlor
from
the
dining
room
strongly
tempted
to
eavesdrop
she
did
yield
so
far
as
to
put
her
ear
to
the
keyhole
but
the
silence
within
impressed
her
strangely
and
she
retreated
to
the
kitchen
and
closed
the
door
tightly
behind
her
as
the
most
practical
method
of
bidding
satan
begone
the
silence
in
the
parlor
lasted
while
kent
standing
with
his
back
against
the
door
faced
val
and
meditated
swiftly
upon
the
manner
of
his
telling
well
she
demanded
at
last
i
am
still
waiting
to
see
manley
i
am
not
quite
a
child
burnett
i
know
something
is
the
matter
and
you
if
you
have
any
pity
or
any
feeling
of
friendship
you
will
tell
me
the
truth
do
you
suppose
i
know
that
arline
was
to
me
all
the
time
about
manley
you
helped
her
to
lie
so
did
that
other
man
i
waited
until
i
reached
town
where
i
could
do
something
and
now
you
must
tell
me
the
truth
manley
is
badly
hurt
or
he
is
dead
tell
me
which
it
is
and
take
me
to
she
spoke
fast
as
if
she
was
afraid
she
might
not
be
able
to
finish
though
her
voice
was
even
and
low
it
was
also
flat
and
toneless
with
her
effort
to
seem
perfectly
calm
and
kent
looked
at
her
forgot
all
about
leading
up
to
the
truth
by
easy
stages
as
he
had
intended
to
do
and
gave
it
to
her
straight
he
either
one
he
said
he
drunk
val
stared
at
him
drunk
he
could
see
how
even
her
lips
shrank
from
the
word
she
threw
up
her
head
that
she
declared
icily
i
know
to
be
impossible
oh
do
you
let
me
tell
you
that
impossible
with
a
man
not
when
there
whisky
manley
is
not
that
sort
of
a
man
when
he
left
me
three
years
ago
he
promised
me
never
to
frequent
places
where
liquor
is
sold
he
never
had
touched
liquor
he
never
was
tempted
to
touch
it
but
just
to
be
doubly
sure
he
promised
me
on
his
honor
he
has
never
broken
that
promise
i
know
because
he
told
me
she
made
the
explanation
scornfully
as
if
her
pride
and
her
belief
in
manley
almost
forbade
the
indignity
of
explaining
i
do
know
why
you
should
come
here
and
insult
me
she
added
with
a
lofty
charity
for
his
sin
i
do
see
how
it
can
insult
you
he
contended
you
got
a
different
way
of
looking
at
things
but
that
wo
help
you
to
dodge
facts
drunk
i
said
it
and
i
mean
it
it
ai
the
first
time
nor
the
second
he
was
drunk
the
day
you
came
and
could
meet
the
train
that
why
i
met
you
i
ought
to
told
you
i
guess
but
i
hated
to
make
you
feel
bad
so
i
went
to
work
and
sobered
him
up
and
sent
him
over
to
get
married
i
always
been
kinda
sorry
for
that
it
was
a
trick
to
play
on
you
and
that
a
fact
you
ought
to
had
a
chance
to
draw
outa
the
game
but
i
did
think
about
it
at
the
time
man
and
i
have
always
been
pretty
good
friends
and
i
was
thinking
of
side
of
the
case
i
thought
straighten
up
after
he
got
married
he
was
such
a
hard
drinker
only
he
go
on
a
toot
when
he
got
into
town
like
lots
of
men
i
did
think
it
had
such
a
strong
hold
on
him
and
i
knew
he
thought
a
lot
of
you
and
if
you
went
back
on
him
it
hit
him
pretty
hard
man
ai
a
bad
fellow
only
for
that
and
he
liable
to
do
better
when
he
finds
out
you
know
about
it
a
man
will
do
anything
for
a
woman
he
thinks
a
lot
indeed
val
was
sitting
now
upon
the
red
plush
chair
her
face
was
perfectly
colorless
her
manner
frozen
the
word
seemed
to
speak
itself
without
having
any
relation
whatever
to
her
thoughts
and
her
emotions
kent
waited
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
took
it
harder
than
she
would
have
taken
the
news
that
manley
was
dead
he
had
no
means
of
gauging
the
horror
of
a
young
woman
who
has
all
her
life
been
familiar
with
such
terms
as
the
demon
rum
and
who
has
been
taught
that
intemperance
is
the
doorway
to
perdition
a
young
woman
whose
life
has
been
sheltered
jealously
from
all
contact
with
the
ugly
things
of
the
world
and
who
believes
that
she
might
better
die
than
marry
a
drunkard
he
watched
her
unobtrusively
anyway
it
was
worrying
over
you
that
made
him
get
off
wrong
he
ventured
at
last
as
a
sort
of
palliative
they
say
he
was
going
to
start
home
right
in
the
face
of
the
fire
and
when
they
would
let
him
he
headed
straight
for
a
saloon
and
commenced
to
pour
whisky
down
him
he
thought
sure
you
he
thought
the
fire
would
i
see
val
interrupted
stonily
for
the
very
doubtful
honor
of
shaking
the
hand
of
a
politician
he
left
me
alone
to
face
as
best
i
might
the
possibility
of
burning
alive
and
when
it
seemed
likely
that
the
possibility
had
become
a
certainty
he
must
celebrate
his
bereavement
by
becoming
a
beast
is
that
what
you
would
have
me
believe
of
my
husband
that
about
the
size
of
it
kent
admitted
reluctantly
only
i
have
put
it
just
that
way
indeed
and
how
would
you
pit
it
then
kent
leaned
harder
against
the
door
and
looked
at
her
curiously
women
it
seemed
to
him
were
always
going
to
extremes
they
were
either
too
soft
and
meek
or
else
they
were
too
hard
and
unmerciful
how
would
you
put
it
i
am
rather
curious
to
know
your
point
of
well
i
know
men
better
than
you
do
fleetwood
i
know
they
can
do
some
things
that
look
pretty
rotten
on
the
surface
and
yet
be
fairly
decent
underneath
you
do
know
how
a
habit
like
that
gets
a
fellow
just
where
he
weakest
man
ai
a
beast
he
selfish
and
careless
and
he
gives
way
too
easy
but
he
thinks
the
world
of
you
jim
says
he
cried
like
a
baby
when
he
came
into
the
saloon
and
acted
like
a
crazy
man
you
want
to
be
too
hard
on
him
i
an
idea
this
will
learn
him
a
lesson
if
you
take
him
the
right
way
fleetwood
the
chances
are
he
quit
val
smiled
kent
thought
he
had
never
before
seen
a
smile
like
that
and
hoped
he
never
would
see
another
there
was
in
it
neither
mercy
nor
mirth
but
only
the
hard
judgment
of
a
woman
who
does
not
understand
will
you
bring
him
to
me
here
burnett
i
do
not
feel
quite
equal
to
invading
a
saloon
and
begging
him
on
my
knees
to
come
after
the
conventional
manner
of
drunkards
wives
but
i
should
like
to
see
kent
stared
he
ai
in
any
shape
to
argue
with
he
remonstrated
you
better
wait
a
she
rested
her
chin
upon
her
hands
folded
upon
the
high
chair
back
and
gazed
at
him
with
her
tawny
eyes
that
somehow
reminded
kent
of
a
lioness
in
a
cage
he
thought
swiftly
that
a
lioness
would
have
as
much
mercy
as
she
had
in
that
mood
mr
burnett
she
began
quietly
when
kent
nerves
were
beginning
to
feel
the
strain
of
her
silent
stare
i
want
to
see
manley
he
is
i
will
tell
you
why
you
are
a
woman
and
you
never
will
understand
but
i
shall
tell
you
i
want
to
tell
i
was
raised
well
that
sounds
queer
but
modesty
forbids
more
at
any
rate
my
mother
was
very
careful
about
me
she
believed
in
a
girl
marrying
and
becoming
a
good
wife
to
a
good
man
and
to
that
end
she
taught
me
and
trained
me
a
woman
must
give
her
all
her
life
her
past
present
and
future
to
the
man
she
marries
for
three
years
i
thought
how
unworthy
i
was
to
be
manley
wife
do
you
hear
i
slept
with
his
letters
under
my
the
in
her
tone
i
studied
the
things
i
thought
would
make
me
a
better
companion
out
here
in
the
wilderness
i
practiced
hours
and
hours
every
day
upon
my
violin
because
manley
had
admired
my
playing
and
i
thought
it
would
please
him
to
have
me
play
in
the
firelight
on
winter
evenings
when
the
blizzards
were
howling
about
the
house
i
learned
to
cook
to
wash
clothes
to
iron
to
sweep
and
to
scrub
and
to
make
my
own
clothes
because
manley
wife
would
live
where
she
could
not
hire
servants
to
do
these
things
i
lived
a
beautiful
picturesque
dream
of
domestic
happiness
i
left
my
friends
my
home
all
the
things
i
had
been
accustomed
to
all
my
life
and
i
came
out
here
to
live
that
dream
she
laughed
bitterly
you
can
easily
guess
how
much
of
it
has
come
true
burnett
but
you
do
know
what
it
costs
a
girl
to
come
down
from
the
clouds
and
find
that
reality
is
hard
and
ugly
from
dreaming
of
a
cozy
little
nest
of
a
home
and
the
love
and
care
of
of
manley
to
the
reality
to
carrying
water
and
chopping
wood
and
being
left
alone
day
after
day
and
to
find
that
his
love
only
meant
oh
you
do
know
how
a
woman
clings
to
her
ideals
you
do
know
how
i
have
dung
to
mine
they
have
become
rather
tattered
and
i
have
had
to
mend
them
often
but
i
have
clung
to
them
even
though
they
do
not
resemble
much
the
dreams
i
brought
with
me
to
this
horrible
country
but
if
it
true
what
you
tell
me
if
manley
himself
is
another
disillusionment
if
beyond
his
selfishness
and
his
carelessness
he
is
a
drunken
brute
whom
i
ca
even
respect
then
i
done
with
my
ideals
i
want
to
see
him
just
as
he
is
i
want
to
see
him
once
without
the
halo
i
have
kept
shining
all
these
months
i
got
my
life
to
live
but
i
want
to
face
facts
and
live
facts
i
ca
go
on
dreaming
and
making
believe
after
she
stopped
and
looked
at
him
speculatively
absolutely
without
emotion
just
before
i
left
home
she
went
on
in
the
same
calm
quiet
a
girl
showed
me
some
verses
written
by
a
very
wicked
man
at
least
they
say
he
is
very
wicked
at
any
rate
he
is
in
jail
i
thought
the
verses
horrible
and
brutal
but
now
i
think
the
man
must
be
very
wise
i
remember
a
few
lines
and
they
seem
to
me
to
mean
manley
for
each
man
kills
the
thing
he
loves
some
do
it
with
a
bitter
look
some
with
a
flattering
word
the
coward
does
it
with
a
kiss
the
brave
man
with
a
sword
i
do
remember
all
of
it
but
there
was
another
line
or
two
the
kindest
use
a
knife
because
the
dead
so
soon
grow
cold
i
wish
i
had
that
poem
now
i
think
i
could
understand
it
i
think
i
think
you
got
talking
hysterics
if
there
is
such
a
thing
kent
interrupted
harshly
you
do
know
half
what
you
saying
you
had
a
hard
day
and
you
all
tired
out
and
everything
looks
outa
focus
i
know
i
seen
men
like
that
sometimes
when
some
trouble
hit
hard
and
unexpected
what
you
want
is
sleep
not
poetry
about
killing
people
a
man
in
the
shape
you
are
in
takes
to
whisky
you
taking
to
graveyard
poetry
and
if
you
ask
that
worse
than
whisky
you
ai
normal
what
you
want
to
do
is
go
straight
to
bed
when
you
wake
up
in
the
morning
you
wo
feel
so
bad
you
wo
have
half
as
many
troubles
as
you
got
i
knew
you
would
understand
it
val
remarked
coldly
still
staring
at
him
with
her
chin
on
her
hands
you
wo
yourself
morning
kent
declared
unsympathetically
and
called
hawley
from
the
kitchen
you
better
put
fleetwood
to
bed
he
advised
gruffly
and
if
you
got
anything
that
make
her
sleep
give
her
a
dose
of
it
she
so
tired
she
ca
see
he
was
nearly
to
the
outside
door
when
val
recovered
her
speech
you
men
are
all
alike
she
said
contemptuously
you
give
orders
and
you
consider
yourselves
above
all
the
laws
of
morality
or
decency
in
reality
you
are
beneath
them
we
should
expect
anything
of
the
lower
animals
how
i
men
now
you
grinned
kent
quite
unmoved
whack
us
in
a
bunch
all
you
like
but
do
make
one
poor
devil
take
it
all
men
as
a
class
are
used
to
it
and
can
stand
he
was
laughing
as
he
left
the
room
but
his
amusement
lasted
only
until
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
lord
he
exclaimed
and
drew
a
deep
breath
i
sure
hate
to
have
that
little
woman
say
all
them
things
about
and
glanced
involuntarily
over
his
shoulder
to
where
a
crack
of
light
showed
under
the
faded
green
shade
of
one
of
the
parlor
windows
he
crossed
the
street
and
entered
the
saloon
where
manley
was
still
drinking
heavily
his
face
crimson
and
and
brutalized
his
speech
thickened
disgustingly
he
was
sprawled
in
an
armchair
waving
an
empty
glass
in
an
erratic
attempt
to
mark
the
time
of
a
college
ditty
six
or
seven
years
out
of
date
which
he
was
trying
to
sing

active
but
so
was
manley

tried
the
power
of
persuasion
leaving
force
as
a
last
doubtful
result
in
fifteen
minutes
or
thereabouts
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
manley
outside

savvy
he
had
a
sickening
sense
that
the
subterfuge
would
not
have
deceived
a
child
but
it
was
accepted
without
question
he
led
manley
stumbling
up
the
street
evading
a
direct
statement
as
to
his
destination
pulled
him
off
the
board
walk
and
took
him
across
a
vacant
lot
well
sprinkled
with
old
shoes
and
tin
cans
here
manley
fell
down
and
kent
patience
was
well
tested
before
he
got
him
up
and
going
again
where
y
goin
manley
inquired
pettishly
as
often
as
he
could
bring
his
tongue
to
the
labor
of
articulation
you
wait
and
i
show
you
was
kent
unvaried
reply
at
last
he
pushed
open
a
door
and
led
his
victim
into
the
darkness
of
a
small
windowless
building
it
in
here
back
against
the
wall
there
he
said
pulling
manley
after
him
by
feeling
and
by
a
good
sense
of
location
he
arrived
at
a
rough
bunk
built
against
the
farther
wall
with
a
blanket
or
two
upon
it
there
you
are
he
announced
grimly

a
sweet
time

had
pushed
manley
down
upon
the
bunk
and
had
reached
the
door
before
the
other
could
get
up
and
come
at
him
he
pulled
the
door
shut
with
a
slam
slipped
a
padlock
into
the
staple
and
snapped
it
just
before
manley
lurched
heavily
against
it
he
was
cursing
as
well
as
he
could
was
manley
and
he
began
kicking
like
an
unruly
child
shut
into
a
closet

profane
promise
to
cut
kent
heart
out
very
early
the
next
day
the
darned
fool
kent
commented
as
he
stopped
in
the
first
patch
of

a
cigarette

coffeepot
for
fair
if
you

kent
left
the
door
of
the
ice
house
wide
open
behind
him
so
that
the
warmth
of
swept
in
to
do
battle
with
the
chill
and
damp
of
wet
sawdust
and
buried
ice
manley
rolled
over
so
that
he
faced
his
visitor
and
his
reply
was
abusive
in
the
extreme
kent
waited
with
an
air
of
impersonal
interest
until
he
was
done
and
had
turned
his
face
away
as
though
the
subject
was
quite
exhausted
well
now
you
got
that
load
off
your
mind
come
on
over
and
get
a
cup
of
coffee
but
while
you
thinking
about
whether
you
want
anything
but
my
heart
blood
i
going
to
speak
right
up
and
tell
you
a
few
things
that
commonly
ai
none
of
my
business
do
you
know
your
wife
came
within
an
ace
of
burning
to
death
yesterday
manley
sat
up
with
a
jerk
and
glared
at
him
do
you
know
you
burned
out
slick
and
clean
all
except
the
shack
hay
stables
corral
wagons
chickens
kent
spread
his
hands
in
a
gesture
including
all
minor
details
i
rode
over
there
when
i
saw
the
fire
coming
and
it
lucky
i
did
i
and
saved
the
house
and
your
wife
from
going
up
in
smoke
but
everything
else
went
let
that
sink
into
your
system
will
you
and
just
see
if
you
can
draw
a
picture
of
what
woulda
happened
if
nobody
had
showed
up
if
that
fire
had
hit
the
coulee
with
nobody
there
but
your
wife
why
i
run
onto
her
up
the
bluff
packing
a
wet
sack
to
fight
it
at
the
fire
guards
i
now
man
it
ai
any
credit
to
that
the
worst
did
happen
i
sure
like
to
tell
you
what
i
think
of
a
fellow
that
will
leave
a
woman
out
there
twenty
miles
from
town
and
ten
from
the
nearest
neighbor
and
them
not
at
home
to
take
a
chance
on
a
thing
like
that
but
i
ca
i
never
learned
words
enough
there
another
thing
old
lady
hawley
took
more
interest
in
her
than
you
did
she
drove
out
there
to
see
how
about
it
as
soon
as
the
fire
had
burned
on
past
and
left
the
trail
safe
and
it
did
look
good
to
her
that
little
woman
stuck
out
there
all
by
herself
she
made
her
pack
up
some
clothes
and
brought
her
to
town
with
her
she
did
want
to
come
she
had
an
idea
that
she
ought
to
stay
with
it
till
you
showed
up
but
the
only
original
hawley
is
sure
all
right
she
talked
your
wife
plumb
outa
the
house
and
into
the
rig
and
brought
her
to
town
she
over
to
the
hotel
val
at
the
hotel
how
long
has
she
been
there
manley
began
smoothing
his
hair
and
his
crumpled
clothes
with
his
hands
good
heavens
you
told
her
i
gone
on
out
and
had
missed
her
on
the
trail
did
you
kent
she
does
know
i
in
town
does
she
you
always
were
a
good
fellow
i
have
forgotten
how
you
well
you
can
forget
it
now
i
did
tell
her
anything
like
that
i
did
think
of
it
for
one
thing
she
knew
all
the
time
that
you
were
in
town
i
tired
of
lying
to
her
i
told
her
the
truth
i
told
her
you
were
manley
jaw
dropped
you
you
told
her
i
told
her
you
were
kent
nodded
gravely
and
his
lips
curled
as
he
watched
the
other
cringe
she
called
me
a
liar
he
added
with
a
certain
reminiscent
amusement
manley
brightened
that
val
once
she
believes
in
a
person
she
loyal
as
she
ai
now
kent
interposed
dryly
when
i
let
up
she
was
plumb
convinced
she
knows
now
what
ailed
you
the
day
she
came
and
you
meet
you
dirty
cur
and
i
thought
you
were
a
friend
you
you
thought
right
until
you
got
to
rooting
a
little
too
deep
in
the
mud
and
let
me
tell
you
something
i
was
your
friend
when
i
told
her
she
got
to
know
you
could
go
on
like
this
much
longer
without
having
her
get
wise
she
ai
a
fool
the
thing
for
you
to
do
now
is
to
buck
up
and
let
her
reform
you
i
always
heard
that
women
are
tickled
plumb
to
death
when
they
can
reform
a
man
you
go
on
over
there
and
make
your
little
talk
and
then
buckle
down
and
live
up
to
it
savvy
your
only
chance
now
it
work
too
you
to
straighten
up
man
and
act
white
not
just
to
square
yourself
with
her
but
because
you
going
downhill
pretty
fast
if
you
only
knew
it
you
ai
anything
like
you
were
two
years
ago
when
we
bached
together
you
got
to
brace
up
pretty
sudden
or
you
be
so
far
gone
you
ca
climb
back
and
when
a
man
has
got
a
wife
to
look
after
it
seems
to
me
he
ought
to
be
the
best
it
in
him
to
be
you
were
a
fine
fellow
when
you
first
hit
the
country
and
she
thought
she
was
getting
that
same
fine
fellow
when
she
came
away
out
here
to
marry
you
it
ai
any
of
my
business
but
do
you
think
you
giving
her
a
square
deal
he
waited
a
minute
and
spoke
the
next
sentence
with
a
certain
diffidence
i
gamble
you
have
been
disappointed
in
she
an
angel
and
i
a
beast
groaned
manley
with
the
exaggerated
which
so
frequently
follows
close
upon
the
heels
of
intoxication
she
never
forgive
a
thing
like
that
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
blow
my
brains
out
like
walt
and
have
your
picture
enlarged
and
put
in
a
gold
frame
and
hubby
number
two
learning
his
morals
from
your
awful
example
elaborated
kent
in
much
the
same
tone
he
had
employed
when
val
only
the
day
before
had
rashly
expressed
a
wish
for
a
speedy
death
manley
sat
up
straighter
and
sent
a
look
of
resentment
toward
the
man
who
bantered
when
he
should
have
sympathized
it
all
a
big
joke
with
you
of
course
he
flared
weakly
you
not
married
to
a
perfect
woman
a
woman
who
never
did
anything
wrong
in
her
life
and
ca
understand
how
anybody
should
want
to
and
ca
forgive
him
when
he
does
she
expects
a
man
to
be
a
saint
why
i
do
even
smoke
in
the
house
and
she
does
dream
ever
swear
under
any
circumstances
why
kent
a
fellow
to
go
to
town
and
turn
himself
loose
sometimes
when
he
lives
in
a
rarified
atmosphere
of
refined
morality
and
listens
to
songs
without
words
and
weepy
classics
on
the
violin
and
never
a
thing
to
make
your
feet
tingle
she
does
believe
in
public
dances
either
nor
cards
she
reads
ring
and
the
book
evenings
and
wants
to
discuss
it
and
read
passages
of
it
to
me
i
used
to
take
some
interest
in
those
things
and
she
does
seem
to
see
i
changed
why
hang
it
kent
cold
spring
coulee
no
place
for
browning
he
does
fit
in
all
that
sort
of
thing
is
a
thousand
miles
behind
me
and
i
got
to
he
stopped
short
and
brooded
his
eyes
upon
the
dank
sawdust
at
his
feet
i
a
beast
he
repeated
rather
lugubriously
she
an
angel
an
angel
and
let
me
tell
you
kent
all
that
pretty
hard
to
live
up
to
kent
looked
down
at
him
meditatively
wondering
if
there
was
not
a
good
deal
of
truth
and
justice
in
manley
argument
but
his
sympathies
had
already
gone
to
the
other
side
and
kent
was
not
the
man
to
make
an
emotional
pendulum
of
himself
well
what
you
going
to
do
about
it
he
asked
after
a
short
silence
for
answer
manley
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
certain
air
of
determination
which
flamed
up
oddly
above
his
general
weakness
like
the
last
sputter
of
a
candle
burned
down
i
going
over
and
take
my
medicine
face
the
music
he
said
almost
sullenly
she
too
good
for
me
i
always
knew
it
and
i
have
treated
her
right
i
left
her
out
there
alone
too
much
but
she
would
come
to
town
with
me
she
said
she
could
endure
the
sight
of
it
what
could
i
do
could
stay
out
there
all
the
time
there
were
times
when
i
had
to
come
she
did
seem
to
mind
staying
alone
she
never
objected
she
was
always
sweet
sad
and
shut
up
inside
of
herself
she
just
gives
you
what
she
pleases
of
her
mind
and
the
rest
she
hides
kent
laughed
suddenly
you
married
men
sure
do
have
all
kinds
of
trouble
he
remarked
a
fellow
like
me
can
go
on
a
jamboree
any
time
he
likes
and
as
long
as
he
likes
and
it
do
concern
anybody
but
himself
and
maybe
the
man
he
working
for
and
look
at
you
scared
plumb
silly
thinking
of
what
your
wife
going
to
say
about
it
if
you
ask
me
i
going
to
trot
alone
i
rather
be
lonesome
than
good
any
old
that
however
did
not
tend
to
raise
manley
spirits
any
he
entered
the
hotel
with
visible
reluctance
looked
into
the
parlor
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
he
saw
that
it
was
empty
wavered
at
the
foot
of
the
steep
narrow
stairs
and
retreated
to
the
dining
room
with
kent
at
his
heels
knowing
that
the
matter
had
passed
quite
beyond
his
help
or
hindrance
and
had
entered
that
mysterious
realm
of
matrimony
where
no
unwedded
man
or
woman
may
follow
and
yet
is
curious
enough
to
linger
just
inside
the
door
manley
stopped
so
suddenly
that
kent
bumped
against
him
val
sweet
and
calm
and
cool
was
sitting
just
where
the
sunlight
poured
in
through
a
window
upon
her
and
a
breeze
came
with
it
and
stirred
her
hair
she
had
those
purple
shadows
under
her
eyes
which
betray
us
after
long
sleepless
hours
when
we
live
with
our
troubles
and
the
world
dreams
around
us
she
had
no
color
at
all
in
her
cheeks
and
she
had
that
aloofness
of
manner
which
manley
in
his
outburst
had
described
as
being
shut
up
inside
herself
she
glanced
up
at
them
just
as
she
would
have
done
had
they
both
been
strangers
and
went
on
sugaring
her
coffee
with
a
dainty
exactness
which
under
the
circumstances
seemed
altogether
too
elaborate
to
be
unconscious
good
morning
she
greeted
them
quietly
i
think
we
must
be
the
laziest
people
in
town
at
any
rate
we
seem
to
be
the
latest
kent
stared
at
her
frankly
so
that
she
flushed
a
little
under
the
scrutiny
manley
consciously
avoided
looking
at
her
and
muttered
something
unintelligible
while
he
pulled
out
a
chair
three
places
distant
from
her
val
stole
a
sidelong
measuring
look
at
her
husband
while
she
took
a
sip
of
coffee
and
then
her
eyes
turned
upon
kent
more
than
ever
it
seemed
to
him
they
resembled
the
eyes
of
a
lioness
watching
you
quietly
from
the
corner
of
her
cage
you
could
look
at
them
but
you
could
not
look
into
them
always
they
met
your
gaze
with
a
baffling
veil
of
inscrutability
but
they
were
darker
than
the
eyes
of
a
lioness
they
were
human
eyes
woman
eyes
alluring
eyes
she
did
not
say
a
word
and
after
a
brief
stare
which
might
have
meant
almost
anything
she
turned
to
her
plate
of
toast
and
broke
away
the
burned
edges
of
a
slice
and
nibbled
at
the
passable
center
as
if
she
had
no
trouble
beyond
a
rather
unsatisfactory
breakfast
it
was
foolish
it
was
childish
for
three
people
who
knew
one
another
very
well
to
sit
and
pretend
to
eat
and
to
speak
no
word
so
kent
thought
and
tried
to
break
the
silence
with
some
remark
which
would
not
sound
constrained
it
going
to
storm
he
flung
into
the
silence
like
chucking
a
rock
into
a
pond
do
you
think
so
val
asked
languidly
just
grazing
him
with
a
glance
in
that
inattentive
way
she
sometimes
had
are
you
going
out
home
or
to
what
left
of
it
manley
she
did
not
look
at
him
at
all
kent
observed
i
do
know
i
have
to
hire
a
team
i
see
what
mrs
hawley
thinks
we
ought
to
stay
here
for
a
few
days
or
that
i
ought
while
you
make
arrangements
for
building
a
new
stable
and
all
if
you
want
to
stay
manley
agreed
rather
eagerly
why
of
course
you
can
there
nothing
out
there
to
oh
it
does
matter
in
the
slightest
degree
where
i
stay
i
only
mentioned
it
because
i
promised
her
i
would
speak
to
you
about
there
was
more
than
languor
in
her
tone
they
going
to
start
the
fireworks
pretty
quick
kent
mentally
diagnosed
the
situation
and
rose
hurriedly
well
i
got
to
hunt
a
horse
myself
and
pull
out
for
the
wishbone
he
explained
gratuitously
ought
to
gone
last
night
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
now
they
can
fight
it
out
he
told
himself
glad
ai
a
married
man
however
they
did
not
fight
it
out
then
kent
had
no
more
than
reached
the
office
when
val
rose
hoped
that
manley
would
please
excuse
her
and
left
the
room
also
manley
heard
her
go
found
out
from
arline
what
was
the
number
of
val
room
and
followed
her
the
door
was
locked
but
when
he
rapped
upon
it
val
opened
it
an
inch
and
held
it
so
val
let
me
in
i
want
to
talk
with
you
i
god
knows
how
sorry
i
am
if
he
does
that
ought
to
be
sufficient
she
answered
coldly
i
feel
like
talking
now
especially
upon
the
subject
you
would
choose
a
man
supposedly
you
must
know
what
it
is
your
duty
to
do
please
let
us
not
discuss
it
now
or
ever
but
val
i
do
want
to
talk
about
it
i
tell
you
i
wo
i
you
must
do
without
the
conventional
confession
and
absolution
you
must
have
some
sort
of
conscience
let
that
receive
your
she
started
to
close
the
door
but
he
caught
it
with
his
hand
val
do
you
hate
me
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
as
if
she
were
trying
to
decide
no
she
said
at
last
i
do
think
i
do
i
quite
sure
that
i
do
not
but
terribly
hurt
and
she
closed
the
door
then
and
turned
the
key
manley
stood
for
a
moment
rather
blankly
before
it
then
put
his
hands
as
deep
in
his
pockets
as
they
would
go
and
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
at
that
moment
he
did
not
feel
particularly
penitent
she
would
not
listen
to
the
conventional
confession
that
girl
can
be
hard
as
nails
he
muttered
under
his
breath
he
went
into
the
office
got
a
cigar
and
lighted
it
moodily
he
glanced
at
the
bottles
ranged
upon
the
shelves
behind
the
bar
drew
in
his
breath
for
speech
let
it
go
in
a
sigh
and
walked
out
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
val
had
meant
she
had
deliberately
thrown
him
back
upon
his
own
strength
he
had
fallen
by
himself
he
must
pick
himself
up
and
she
would
stand
back
and
watch
the
struggle
and
judge
him
according
to
his
failure
or
his
success
he
had
a
dim
sense
that
it
was
a
dangerous
experiment
he
looked
for
kent
found
him
just
as
he
was
mounting
at
the
stables
and
let
him
go
almost
without
a
word
after
all
no
one
could
help
him
he
stood
there
smoking
after
kent
had
gone
and
when
his
cigar
was
finished
he
wandered
back
to
the
hotel
as
was
always
the
case
after
hard
drinking
he
had
a
splitting
headache
he
got
a
room
as
close
to
val
as
he
could
shut
himself
into
it
and
gave
himself
up
to
his
headache
and
to
gloomy
meditation
all
day
he
lay
upon
the
bed
and
part
of
the
time
he
slept
at
supper
time
he
rapped
upon
val
door
got
no
answer
and
went
down
alone
to
find
her
in
the
dining
room
there
was
an
empty
chair
beside
her
and
he
took
it
as
his
right
she
talked
a
little
about
the
fire
and
the
damage
it
had
done
she
said
she
was
worried
because
she
had
forgotten
to
bring
the
cat
and
what
would
it
find
to
eat
out
there
everything
burned
perfectly
black
for
miles
and
miles
you
know
she
reminded
him
they
left
the
room
together
and
he
followed
her
upstairs
and
to
her
door
this
time
she
did
not
shut
him
out
and
he
went
in
and
sat
down
by
the
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
meager
little
street
never
in
the
years
he
had
known
her
had
she
been
so
far
from
him
he
watched
her
covertly
while
she
searched
for
something
in
her
suit
case
i
afraid
i
did
bring
enough
clothes
to
last
more
than
a
day
or
two
she
remarked
i
could
seem
to
think
of
anything
that
night
arline
did
most
of
the
packing
for
me
i
afraid
i
misjudged
that
woman
manley
there
a
good
deal
to
her
after
all
but
she
val
i
want
to
tell
you
i
going
to
to
be
different
i
been
a
beast
but
i
going
to
so
much
he
had
rushed
out
before
she
could
freeze
him
to
silence
again
i
hope
so
she
cut
in
as
he
hesitated
that
is
something
you
must
judge
for
yourself
and
do
by
yourself
do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
get
a
team
tomorrow
oh
to
hell
with
a
team
manley
exploded
val
dropped
her
hairbrush
upon
the
floor
manley
fleetwood
has
it
come
to
that
also
is
it
enough
to
she
choked
manley
you
can
be
a
a
drunken
sot
if
you
choose
i
no
power
to
prevent
you
but
you
shall
not
swear
in
my
presence
i
thought
you
had
some
of
the
instincts
of
a
gentleman
but
she
set
her
teeth
hard
together
she
was
white
around
the
mouth
and
her
whole
slim
body
was
aquiver
with
outraged
dignity
there
was
something
queer
in
manley
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
the
length
of
the
tiny
room
between
them
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
remember
now
your
fern
hill
ethics
i
may
to
hell
for
all
of
you
you
will
simply
hold
back
your
immaculate
moral
skirts
so
that
i
may
pass
without
smirching
them
but
i
must
not
mention
my
destination
that
is
so
unrefined
he
got
up
from
the
chair
with
a
laugh
that
was
almost
a
snort
you
refuse
to
discuss
a
certain
subject
though
it
almost
a
matter
of
life
and
death
with
me
at
least
it
was
your
happiness
and
my
own
was
at
stake
i
thought
but
it
all
right
i
have
worried
about
it
i
still
have
some
of
the
instincts
of
a
gentleman
and
your
pure
ears
shall
not
be
offended
by
any
profanity
or
any
disagreeable
confessions
the
absolution
let
me
say
i
expected
to
do
he
started
full
of
some
secret
intent
for
the
door
val
humanized
suddenly
by
the
time
his
fingers
touched
the
door
knob
she
had
read
his
purpose
had
readied
his
side
and
was
clutching
his
arm
with
both
her
hands
manley
fleetwood
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
was
actually
panting
with
the
jump
of
her
heart
he
turned
the
knob
so
that
the
latch
clicked
get
drunk
be
the
drunken
sot
you
expect
me
to
be
go
to
that
vulgar
place
which
i
must
not
mention
in
your
presence
let
go
my
arm
she
was
all
woman
then
she
pulled
him
away
from
the
door
and
the
unnamed
horror
which
lay
outside
she
was
not
the
crying
sort
but
she
cried
just
the
same
heartbrokenly
her
head
against
his
shoulder
as
if
she
herself
were
the
sinner
she
clung
to
him
she
begged
him
to
forgive
her
hardness
she
learned
something
which
every
woman
must
learn
if
she
would
keep
a
little
happiness
in
her
life
she
learned
how
to
forgive
the
man
she
loved
and
to
trust
him
afterward
chapter
xiii
arline
gives
a
dance
a
house
it
would
seem
is
almost
the
least
important
part
of
a
ranch
one
can
camp
with
frying
pan
and
blankets
in
the
shade
of
a
bush
or
the
shelter
of
canvas
but
to
do
anything
upon
a
ranch
one
must
have
many
things
burnable
things
for
the
most
part
as
manley
was
to
learn
by
experience
when
he
left
val
at
the
hotel
and
rode
out
the
next
day
to
cold
spring
coulee
to
ride
over
twenty
miles
of
blackness
is
depressing
enough
in
itself
but
to
find
at
the
end
of
the
journey
that
one
work
has
all
gone
for
nothing
and
one
money
and
one
plans
and
hopes
is
worse
than
depressing
manley
sat
upon
his
horse
and
gazed
rather
blankly
at
the
heap
of
black
cinders
that
had
been
his
haystacks
and
at
the
cold
embers
where
had
stood
his
stables
and
at
the
warped
bits
of
iron
that
had
been
his
buckboard
his
wagon
his
rake
and
mower
all
the
things
he
had
gathered
around
him
in
the
three
years
he
had
spent
upon
the
place
the
house
merely
emphasized
his
loss
he
got
down
picked
up
the
cat
which
was
mewing
plaintively
beside
his
horse
snuggled
it
into
his
arm
and
remounted
val
had
told
him
to
be
sure
and
find
the
cat
and
bring
it
back
with
him
his
horses
and
his
cattle
not
many
to
be
sure
in
that
land
of
large
holdings
were
scattered
and
it
would
take
the
to
gather
them
together
again
so
the
cat
and
the
horse
he
rode
the
bleak
coulee
and
the
unattractive
little
house
with
its
three
rooms
and
its
meager
porch
were
all
that
he
could
visualize
as
his
worldly
possessions
and
when
he
thought
of
his
bank
account
he
winced
mentally
before
snow
fell
he
would
be
the
best
he
could
do
for
he
must
have
a
stable
and
corral
and
hay
and
a
wagon
and
he
refused
to
remind
himself
of
all
the
things
he
must
have
if
he
would
stay
on
the
ranch
his
was
not
a
strong
nature
at
best
and
now
he
shrank
from
facing
his
misfortune
and
wanted
only
to
get
away
from
the
place
he
loped
his
horse
up
the
hill
which
was
not
merciful
riding
the
cat
yowled
in
his
arms
and
struck
her
claws
through
his
coat
till
he
felt
the
prick
of
them
and
he
swore
at
the
cat
nominally
but
really
at
the
trick
fate
had
played
upon
him
for
a
week
he
dallied
in
town
without
heart
or
courage
though
val
urged
him
to
buy
lumber
and
build
and
cheered
him
as
best
she
could
he
did
make
a
attempt
to
get
lumber
to
the
place
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
team
in
town
which
he
could
hire
every
one
was
busy
and
put
him
off
he
tried
to
buy
hay
of
blumenthall
of
the
wishbone
of
every
man
he
met
who
had
hay
no
one
had
any
hay
to
sell
however
blumenthall
complained
that
he
was
short
himself
and
would
buy
if
he
could
rather
than
sell
the
wishbone
foreman
declared
profanely
that
hay
was
going
to
be
worth
a
dollar
a
pound
to
before
spring
they
were
all
sorry
for
manley
and
told
him
he
was
sure
playing
tough
luck
but
they
could
sell
any
hay
that
was
certain
but
we
must
manage
somehow
to
fix
the
place
so
we
can
live
on
it
this
winter
val
would
insist
when
he
told
her
how
every
move
seemed
blocked
you
very
brave
dear
and
i
proud
of
the
way
you
are
holding
out
but
hope
is
not
a
good
place
for
you
it
would
be
foolish
to
stay
in
town
ca
you
buy
enough
hay
here
in
town
baled
hay
from
the
store
to
keep
our
horses
through
the
winter
well
i
tried
manley
responded
gloomily
but
brinberg
is
nearly
out
he
expecting
a
carload
in
but
it
has
come
yet
he
said
he
let
me
know
when
it
gets
meanwhile
the
days
slipped
away
and
imperceptibly
the
heat
and
haze
of
the
fires
gave
place
to
bright
sunlight
and
chill
winds
and
then
to
the
chill
winds
without
the
sunshine
one
morning
the
ground
was
frozen
hard
and
all
the
roofs
gleamed
white
with
the
heavy
frost
arline
bestirred
herself
and
had
a
heating
stove
set
up
in
the
parlor
and
val
went
down
to
the
dry
heat
and
the
peculiar
odor
of
a
rusted
stove
in
the
flush
of
its
first
fire
since
spring
the
next
day
as
she
sat
by
her
window
she
looked
out
at
the
first
nip
of
winter
a
few
great
snowflakes
drifted
down
from
the
slaty
sky
a
puff
of
wind
sent
them
dancing
down
the
street
shook
more
down
and
whirled
them
giddily
then
the
storm
came
and
swept
through
the
little
street
and
whined
lonesomely
around
the
hotel
over
at
the
saloon
pop
place
it
proclaimed
itself
in
lettering
three
tied
horses
circled
uneasily
until
they
were
standing
back
to
the
storm
their
bodies
hunched
together
with
the
chill
of
it
their
tails
whipping
between
their
legs
they
accentuated
the
blank
dreariness
of
the
empty
street
the
snow
was
whitening
their
rumps
and
clinging
in
tiny
drifts
upon
the
saddle
skirts
behind
the
cantles
all
the
little
hollows
of
the
rough
frozen
ground
were
filling
slowly
making
white
patches
against
the
brown
of
the
earth
patches
which
widened
and
widened
until
they
met
and
the
whole
street
was
blanketed
with
fresh
untrodden
snow
val
shivered
suddenly
and
hurried
where
the
air
was
warm
and
all
with
cooking
and
the
odor
of
frying
onions
smote
the
nostrils
like
a
blow
in
the
face
i
suppose
we
must
stay
here
now
till
the
storm
is
over
she
sighed
when
she
met
manley
at
dinner
but
as
soon
as
it
clears
we
must
go
back
to
the
ranch
i
simply
can
not
endure
another
week
of
you
gitting
uneasy
i
seen
that
two
or
three
days
ago

arline
who

dining
room

tray
of
meat
and
vegetables

precision

hull
thing

i
made
up
my
mind
i

acquainted
with

last
minute

to
have
time
to
mate
up
your
mind
you

to
a
public
dance
for
oncet
in
your
life
it
ai
going
to
hurt
you
none
i
went
ever
sence
i
was
big
enough
to
reach
up
and
grab
holt
of
my
pardner
and
i
every
bit
as
virtuous
as
you
be
you
going
and
man
are
going
to
head
the
grand
val
face
was
flushed
her
lips
pursed
and
her
eyes
wide
plainly
she
was
not
quite
sure
whether
she
was
angry
amused
or
insulted
she
descended
straight
to
a
purely
feminine
objection
but
i
have
a
thing
to
wear
and
oh
yes
you
have
while
you
was
dillydallying
out
in
the
front
room
that
night
wondering
whether
you
have
hysterics
or
faint
or
what
all
i
dug
deep
in
that
biggest
trunk
of
yourn
and
fished
up
one
of
your
party
dresses
white
satin
it
is
with
all
up
down
the
front
and
slimpsy
lace
it
kinda
one
of
them
my
white
satin
why
hawley
that
you
must
have
brought
the
gown
i
wore
to
my
farewell
club
reception
it
has
a
train
and
why
the
you
can
cut
off
the
trail
you
got
plenty
of
time
or
you
can
pin
it
up
i
did
have
time
that
night
to
see
how
the
thing
was
made
and
i
took
it
because
i
found
white
skirts
and
stockin
and
white
satin
slippers
to
go
with
it
right
handy
you
a
bride
and
white
be
suitable
and
the
dance
is
in
your
honor

it
just
as
it
is
fer
all
me
show
the
folks
what
real
clothes

like
i
never
seen
a
woman
dressed
up
that
way
in
my
hull
life
you
wear
it
val
trail
all
i
back
you
up
in
it
and
tell
folks
it
my
idee
and
not
i
not
in
the
habit
of
apologizing
to
people
for
the
clothes
i
val
lifted
her
chin
haughtily
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
i
shall
go
in
fact
i
oh
you
go
arline
rested
her
arms
upon
her
bony
hips
and
snapped
her
meager
jaws
together
you
go
if
i
have
to
carry
you
over
i
sent
for
fifteen
yards
of
buntin
to
decorate
the
hall
with
i
ai
going
to
all
that
trouble
for
nothing
i
ai
giving
a
dance
in
honor
of
a
certain
person
and
then
let
that
person
stay
away
you
why
you
queer
yourself
with
the
hull
country
val
fleetwood
you
ai
got
the
least
sign
of
an
excuse
you
got
the
clothes
and
you
ai
sick
there
a
reason
why
you
got
to
show
up
i
ai
going
into
no
details
at
present
but
under
the
circumstances
it
she
smelled
something
burning
then
and
bolted
for
the
kitchen
where
her
sharp
rather
nasal
voice
was
heard
upbraiding
minnie
for
some
neglect
polycarp
jenks
came
in
eyed
val
and
manley
from
under
one
lifted
eyebrow
smiled
skinnily
and
pulled
out
a
chair
with
a
rasping
noise
and
sat
down
facing
them
instinctively
val
refrained
from
speaking
her
mind
about
arline
and
her
dance
before
polycarp
but
afterward
in
their
own
room
she
grew
rather
eloquent
upon
the
subject
she
would
not
go
she
would
not
permit
that
woman
to
browbeat
her
into
doing
what
she
did
not
want
to
do
she
said
in
her
honor
indeed
the
impertinence
of
going
to
the
bottom
of
her
trunk
and
meddling
with
her
clothes
with
that
reception
gown
of
all
others
the
idea
of
wearing
that
gown
to
a
frontier
dance
even
if
she
consented
to
go
to
such
a
dance
and
expecting
her
to
amuse
the
company
by
playing
pieces
on
the
violin
well
why
not
manley
was
sitting
rather
apathetically
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
his
arms
resting
upon
his
knees
his
eyes
moodily
studying
the
intricate
rose
pattern
in
the
faded
brussels
carpet
they
were
the
first
words
he
had
spoken
one
might
easily
have
doubted
whether
he
had
heard
all
val
said
why
not
manley
fleetwood
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
why
not
go
and
get
acquainted
and
quit
feeling
that
you
a
pearl
cast
among
swine
it
strikes
me
the
hawley
person
is
pretty
on
the
subject
if
you
going
to
live
in
this
country
why
not
quit
thinking
how
out
of
place
you
are
and
how
superior
and
meet
us
all
on
a
level
it
wo
hurt
you
to
go
to
that
dance
and
it
wo
hurt
you
to
play
for
them
if
they
want
you
to
you
play
you
know
you
used
to
play
at
all
the
musical
doings
in
fern
hill
and
even
in
the
city
sometimes
and
let
me
tell
you
val
we
are
quite
savages
out
here
i
even
suspected
sometimes
that
we
just
as
good
as
fern
we
val
looked
at
him
steadily
so
you
wish
to
identify
yourself
with
these
people
with
polycarp
jenks
and
arline
hawley
and
why
not
they
shaky
on
grammar
and
their
manners
could
stand
a
little
polish
but
aside
from
that
they
exactly
like
the
people
you
lived
among
all
your
life
sure
i
wish
to
identify
myself
with
them
i
just
a
rancher
pretty
small
punkins
too
among
all
these
big
outfits
and
a
rancher
wife
the
hawley
person
could
buy
us
out
for
cash
if
she
wanted
to
and
never
miss
the
money
and
val
she
giving
that
dance
in
your
honor
you
ought
to
appreciate
that
the
hawley
does
take
a
fancy
to
every
woman
she
sees
and
let
me
tell
you
she
stands
in
this
country
if
she
did
like
you
she
could
make
you
wish
she
well
upon
my
word
i
begin
to
suspect
you
of
being
a
humorist
manley
and
even
if
you
mean
that
seriously
why
it
all
the
to
prove
it
she
laughed
manley
hesitated
then
left
the
room
with
a
snort
a
scowl
and
a
slam
of
the
door
and
the
sound
of
val
laughter
followed
him
down
the
stairs
arline
came
up
her
arms
full
of
white
satin
white
lace
white
cambric
and
the
toes
of
two
white
satin
slippers
showing
just
above
the
top
of
her
apron
pockets
she
walked
briskly
in
and
deposited
her
burden
upon
the
bed
my
them
the
nicest
smellin
things
i
ever
had
a
hold
of
she
observed
and
still
they
do
seem
to
smell
either
must
be
a
dandy
perfumery
you
got
i
brought
up
the
things
seein
you
know
they
here
i
thought
you
could
take
your
time
about
cuttin
off
the
trail
and
fillin
in
the
neck
and
she
sat
down
upon
the
foot
of
the
bed
carefully
tucking
her
gingham
apron
close
about
her
so
that
it
might
not
come
in
contact
with
the
other
i
never
did
see
such
clothes
she
sighed
i
dunno
how
you
ever
git
a
chancet
to
wear
out
in
this
country
seems
to
me
they
most
too
pretty
to
wear
anyhow
i
can
git
marthy
winters
to
come
over
and
help
you
she
does
sewin
and
you
can
use
my
machine
any
time
you
want
to
take
a
hold
myself
if
i
did
have
all
the
baking
to
do
for
the
dance
that
min
ca
learn
nothing
seems
like
i
ca
trust
her
to
do
a
thing
hardly
unless
i
stand
right
over
her
breed
girls
ai
much
account
ever
but
they
all
that
work
out
in
this
country
seems
like
sometimes
i
swear
i
git
a
chink
and
be
done
with
it
only
i
got
to
have
somebody
i
can
talk
to
oncet
in
a
while
i
could
never
talk
to
a
chink
they
seem
hardly
human
to
me
do
they
to
you
and
say
i
got
some
allover
lace
it
eecrue
that
you
can
fill
in
the
neck
with
you
welcome
to
use
it
there
most
a
yard
of
it
and
i
never
find
a
use
for
it
or
i
was
thinkin
there
be
enough
cut
the
trail
to
make
a
gamp
of
the
satin
sleeves
and
she
lifted
the
shining
stuff
with
manifest
awe
it
does
seem
a
shame
to
put
the
shears
to
it
but
you
never
git
any
wear
out
of
it
the
way
it
is
and
i
believe
mis
shrilled
the
voice
of
minnie
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
there
a
couple
of
the
they
want
what
i
my
heavens
that
girl
drive
me
crazy
sure
arline
hurried
to
the
door
do
take
the
roof
the
house
she
cried
querulously
down
the
stairway
i
val
had
not
spoken
a
word
she
went
over
to
the
bed
lifted
a
fold
of
satin
and
smiled
down
at
it
ironically
mamma
and
i
spent
a
whole
month
planning
and
sewing
and
gloating
over
you
she
said
aloud
you
were
almost
as
important
as
a
wedding
gown
the
club
farewell
reception
what
base
uses
we
do
oh
here
your
slippers
arline
thrust
half
her
body
into
the
room
and
held
the
slippers
out
to
val
i
stuck
into
my
pockets
to
bring
up
and
forgot
all
about
mind
you
till
i
was
handin
the
drummers
their
tea
and
one
of
happened
to
notice
and
raised
right
up
outa
his
chair
an
said
sure
as
i
live
say
if
there
a
foot
in
this
town
that
go
into
them
slippers
for
god
sake
introduce
me
to
the
owner
i
told
him
to
mind
his
own
business
drummers
do
get
awful
fresh
when
they
think
they
can
get
away
with
she
departed
in
a
hurry
as
usual
every
day
after
that
arline
talked
about
altering
the
satin
gown
every
day
val
was
noncommittal
and
unenthusiastic
occasionally
she
told
arline
that
she
was
not
going
to
the
dance
but
arline
declined
to
take
seriously
so
preposterous
a
declaration
you
want
to
break
a
leg
then
she
told
val
grimly
on
thursday
the
only
excuse
that
go
down
with
this
bunch
and
you
better
git
a
move
on
it
comes
off
night
i
wo
go
manley
val
consoled
herself
by
declaring
again
and
again
the
idea
of
arline
hawley
ordering
me
about
like
a
child
why
should
i
go
if
i
do
care
to
go
search
manley
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
is
so
long
though
since
you
were
just
as
determined
to
stay
and
have
the
shivaree
you
well
you
and
burnett
tried
to
do
exactly
what
arline
is
doing
you
seemed
to
think
i
was
a
child
to
be
ordered
at
the
very
last
minute
to
be
explicit
an
hour
before
the
hall
was
lighted
several
hours
after
smoke
first
began
to
rise
from
the
chimney
val
suddenly
swerved
to
a
reckless
mood
arline
had
gone
to
her
own
room
to
dress
too
angry
to
speak
what
was
in
her
mind
she
had
worked
since
five
that
morning
she
had
bullied
val
she
had
argued
she
had
begged
she
had
wheedled
val
would
not
go
arline
had
appealed
to
manley
and
manley
had
assured
her
with
a
suspicious
slurring
of
his
that
he
was
out
of
it
and
had
nothing
to
say
val
he
said
could
not
be
driven
it
was
after
arline
had
gone
to
her
room
and
manley
had
returned
to
the
office
that
val
suddenly
picked
up
her
hairbrush
and
with
an
impish
light
in
her
eyes
began
to
pile
her
hair
high
upon
her
head
with
her
lips
curved
to
match
the
mockery
of
her
eyes
she
began
hurriedly
to
dress
later
she
went
down
to
the
parlor
where
four
women
from
the
neighboring
ranches
were
sitting
stiffly
and
in
constrained
silence
waiting
to
be
escorted
to
the
hall
she
swept
in
upon
them
a
glorious
shimmery
creature
all
in
white
and
gold
the
women
steed
wavered
and
looked
away
at
the
wall
the
floor
at
anything
but
val
bare
white
shoulders
and
arms
as
white
arline
had
forgotten
to
look
for
gloves
val
read
the
consternation
in
their
faces
and
smiled
in
wicked
enjoyment
she
would
shock
all
of
hope
she
would
shock
even
arline
who
had
insisted
upon
this
like
a
child
in
mischief
she
turned
and
went
rustling
down
the
ball
to
the
dining
room
she
wanted
to
show
arline
she
had
not
thought
of
the
possibility
of
finding
any
one
but
arline
and
minnie
there
so
that
she
was
taken
slightly
aback
when
she
discovered
kent
and
another
man
eating
a
belated
supper
kent
looked
up
eyed
her
sharply
for
just
an
instant
and
smiled
good
evening
fleetwood
he
said
calmly
ready
for
the
ball
i
see
we
got
in
he
went
on
spreading
butter
upon
his
bread
evidently
quite
unimpressed
by
her
magnificence
the
other
man
stared
fixedly
at
his
plate
it
was
a
trifle
but
val
suddenly
felt
foolish
and
ashamed
she
took
a
step
or
two
toward
the
kitchen
then
retreated
down
the
hall
she
went
up
the
stairs
and
into
her
own
room
the
door
of
which
she
shut
and
locked
such
a
fool
she
whispered
vehemently
and
stamped
her
foot
upon
the
carpet
he
looked
perfectly
disgusted
and
so
did
that
other
man
and
no
wonder
such
it
val
fleetwood
it
just
and
coarse
and
horrid
she
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
and
put
her
face
in
the
pillow
some
one
she
thought
it
sounded
like
manley
came
up
and
tried
the
door
stood
a
moment
before
it
and
went
away
again
arline
voice
sharpened
with
displeasure
she
heard
speaking
to
minnie
upon
the
stairs
they
went
down
and
there
was
a
confusion
of
voices
below
in
the
street
beneath
her
window
footsteps
sounded
intermittently
coming
and
going
with
a
certain
eagerness
of
tread
after
a
time
there
came
from
a
distance
the
sound
of
violins
and
the
coronet
of
which
arline
had
been
so
proud
and
mingled
with
it
was
an
undercurrent
of
shuffling
feet
a
mere
whisper
of
sound
cut
sharply
now
and
then
by
the
sharp
commands
of
the
floor
manager
they
were
dancing
in
her
honor
and
she
was
a
fool
a
proud
selfish
with
one
of
her
quick
changes
of
mood
she
rose
patted
her
hair
smooth
caught
up
a
wrap
oddly
inharmonious
with
the
gown
and
slippers
looped
her
train
over
her
arm
tool
her
violin
and
ran
lightly
the
parlor
the
dining
room
the
kitchen
were
deserted
and
the
lights
turned
low
she
braced
herself
mentally
and
flushing
at
the
unaccustomed
act
rapped
timidly
upon
the
door
which
opened
into
the
office
which
by
that
time
she
knew
was
really
a
saloon
hawley
himself
opened
the
door
and
in
his
eyes
bulged
at
sight
of
her
is
fleetwood
here
i
i
thought
after
all
i
go
to
the
dance
she
said
in
rather
a
timid
voice
shrinking
back
into
the
shadow
fleetwood
why
i
guess
he
gone
on
over
he
said
you
was
going
you
wait
a
minute
i
here
kent
you
take
fleetwood
over
to
the
hall
man
oh
no
i
really
it
does
matter
but
kent
had
already
thrown
away
his
cigarette
and
come
out
to
her
closing
the
door
immediately
after
him
i
take
you
over
i
was
just
going
anyway
he
assured
her
his
eyes
dwelling
upon
her
rather
intently
oh
i
wanted
manley
i
i
hate
to
go
like
this
it
seems
so
so
queer
in
this
place
at
first
i
i
thought
it
would
be
a
joke
but
it
is
silly
and
and
you
everybody
will
be
shocked
and
kent
took
a
step
toward
her
where
she
was
shrinking
against
the
stairway
once
before
she
had
lost
her
calm
composure
and
had
let
him
peep
into
her
mind
then
it
had
been
on
account
of
manley
now
womanlike
it
was
her
clothes
you
could
be
anything
but
all
right
if
you
tried
he
told
her
speaking
softly
it
is
silly
to
look
the
way
the
lord
meant
you
to
look
you
you
oh
you
need
worry
nobody
going
to
be
shocked
very
he
reached
out
and
took
the
violin
from
her
took
also
her
arm
and
opened
the
outer
door
you
late
he
said
speaking
in
a
more
commonplace
tone
you
ought
to
have
overshoes
or
something
those
white
slippers
wo
be
so
white
time
you
get
there
maybe
i
ought
to
carry
the
idea
she
stepped
out
daintily
upon
the
slushy
walk
well
i
can
take
you
a
block
or
two
around
and
have
sidewalk
all
the
way
that
help
some
women
sure
are
a
lot
of
bother
i
plumb
sorry
for
the
poor
devils
that
get
inveigled
into
marrying
why
burnett
do
you
always
talk
like
that
because
if
you
do
i
wonder
no
kent
interrupted
looking
down
at
her
and
smiling
grimly
as
it
happens
i
do
i
real
nice
generally
speaking
say
this
is
going
to
be
a
good
deal
of
trouble
do
you
know
after
you
dance
with
hubby
got
to
waltz
with
to
val
raised
her
eyebrows
though
the
expression
was
lost
upon
him
sure
look
at
the
way
i
worked
like
a
horse
saving
your
life
and
the
cat
and
now
leading
you
all
over
town
to
keep
those
nice
white
slippers
clean
by
rights
you
ought
to
dance
with
anybody
else
but
i
looking
for
real
gratitude
four
or
five
waltzes
is
all
i
insist
on
but
his
tone
was
lugubrious
in
the
extreme
well
i
waltz
with
you
once
for
saving
the
cat
and
once
for
saving
the
slippers
for
saving
me
i
not
sure
that
i
thank
val
stepped
carefully
over
a
muddy
spot
on
the
walk
mr
burnett
you
really
an
awfully
queer
kent
walked
to
the
next
crossing
and
helped
her
over
it
before
he
answered
her
yes
he
admitted
soberly
then
i
reckon
you
right
i
am
chapter
xiv
a
wedding
present
sunday
it
was
and
val
had
insisted
stubbornly
upon
going
back
to
the
ranch
somewhat
to
her
surprise
if
one
might
judge
by
her
face
arline
hawley
no
longer
demurred
but
put
up
lunch
enough
for
a
week
almost
and
announced
that
she
was
going
along
hank
would
have
to
drive
out
to
bring
back
the
team
and
she
said
she
needed
a
rest
after
all
the
work
and
worry
of
that
dance
manley
upon
whose
account
it
was
that
val
was
so
anxious
seemed
to
have
nothing
whatever
to
say
about
it
he
was
sullenly
acquiescent
as
was
perhaps
to
be
expected
of
a
man
who
had
slipped
into
his
old
habits
and
despised
himself
for
doing
so
and
almost
hated
his
wife
because
she
had
discovered
it
and
said
nothing
val
was
thankful
during
that
long
bleak
ride
over
the
prairie
for
arline
incessant
chatter
it
was
better
than
silence
when
the
silence
means
bitter
thoughts
now
said
arline
moving
excitedly
in
her
seat
when
they
neared
cold
spring
coulee
maybe
i
better
tell
you
that
the
folks
round
here
has
kinda
planned
a
little
for
you
they
do
make
much
of
a
showin
about
bein
neighborly
not
when
things
go
smooth
but
they
right
there
when
trouble
comes
it
jest
a
little
weddin
present
and
if
it
comes
kinda
late
in
the
day
why
you
do
want
to
mind
that
my
dance
that
i
gave
was
a
weddin
party
too
if
you
care
to
call
it
that
anyway
it
was
to
raise
the
money
to
pay
for
our
present
as
far
as
it
went
and
i
want
to
tell
you
right
now
val
that
you
was
sure
the
queen
of
the
ball
everybody
said
you
looked
jest
like
a
queen
in
a
picture
and
i
never
heard
a
word
your
dress
it
looked
all
right
on
do
you
see
on
me
for
instance
it
woulda
been
something
fierce
and
i
real
glad
you
took
a
hold
and
danced
like
you
did
and
never
passed
nobody
up
like
some
woulda
done
you
be
glad
you
did
now
you
know
what
it
was
for
even
danced
with
polycarp
jenks
and
there
ai
hardly
any
woman
but
what
turn
down
i
bet
he
tromped
all
over
your
toes
did
he
sometimes
val
admitted
what
about
the
surprise
you
were
speaking
of
hawley
it
does
seem
as
if
you
might
call
me
arline
she
complained
irrelevantly
we
comin
to
that
do
you
is
it
a
piano
my
lands
no
you
do
need
a
fiddle
and
a
piano
both
do
you
man
what
you
rather
have
for
a
weddin
present
manley
upon
the
front
seat
beside
hank
gave
his
shoulders
an
impatient
twitch
fifty
thousand
dollars
he
replied
glumly
i
glad
you
real
modest
about
it
arline
retorted
sharply
she
was
beginning
to
tell
herself
quite
frequently
that
she
did
have
no
time
for
man
fleetwood
seeing
he
would
brace
up
and
quit
val
lips
curled
as
she
looked
at
manley
back
what
i
should
like
she
said
distinctly
is
a
great
big
pile
of
wood
all
cut
and
ready
for
the
stove
and
water
pails
that
never
would
go
empty
it
astonishing
how
one
desires
eventually
narrow
down
to
bare
essentials
is
it
but
as
we
near
the
place
i
find
those
two
things
more
desirable
than
a
piano
then
she
bit
her
lip
angrily
because
she
had
permitted
herself
to
give
the
thrust
why
you
poor
thing
man
fleetwood
do
you
val
impulsively
caught
her
by
the
arm
oh
hush
i
was
only
joking
she
said
hastily
i
was
trying
to
balance
manley
wish
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
do
you
see
it
was
stupid
of
me
i
she
laughed
unconvincingly
let
me
guess
what
the
surprise
is
first
is
it
large
or
small
kinda
big
tittered
arline
falling
into
the
spirit
of
the
joke
bigger
than
a
wait
now
a
sewing
machine
arline
covered
her
mouth
with
her
hand
and
nodded
dumbly
you
say
all
the
neighbors
gave
it
and
the
dance
helped
pay
for
it
let
me
see
could
it
possibly
be
what
in
the
world
could
it
be
manley
help
me
guess
is
it
something
useful
or
just
something
nice
useful
said
arline
and
snapped
her
jaws
together
as
if
she
feared
to
let
another
word
loose
larger
than
a
sewing
machine
and
val
puckered
her
brows
over
the
puzzle
and
all
the
neighbors
gave
it
do
you
know
i
been
thinking
all
sorts
of
nasty
things
about
our
poor
neighbors
because
they
refused
to
sell
manley
any
hay
and
all
the
while
they
were
planning
this
sur
she
never
finished
that
sentence
or
the
word
even
with
a
jolt
over
a
rock
and
a
sharp
turn
to
the
right
hank
had
brought
them
to
the
very
brow
of
the
hill
where
they
could
look
down
into
the
coulee
and
upon
the
house
standing
in
its
tiny
unkempt
yard
just
beyond
the
sparse
growth
of
bushes
which
marked
the
spring
creek
involuntarily
every
head
turned
that
way
and
every
pair
of
eyes
looked
downward
hank
chirped
to
the
horses
threw
all
his
weight
upon
the
brake
and
they
rattled
down
the
grade
the
brake
block
squealing
against
the
rear
wheels
they
were
down
before
any
one
spoke
it
was
val
and
she
almost
whispered
one
word
manley
arline
eyes
were
wet
and
there
was
a
croak
in
her
voice
when
she
cried
jubilantly
well
ai
that
better
a
sewin
machine
or
a
piano
but
val
did
not
attempt
an
answer
she
was
staring
staring
as
if
she
could
not
convince
herself
of
the
reality
even
manley
was
jarred
out
of
his
gloomy
meditations
and
half
rose
in
the
seat
that
he
might
see
over
shoulder
that
what
your
neighbors
have
done
arline
began
eagerly
and
they
nearly
busted
tryin
to
git
through
in
time
and
to
keep
it
a
dead
secret
they
worked
like
whiteheads
lem
me
tell
you
and
never
even
stopped
for
the
storm
the
night
of
the
dance
i
heard
all
about
how
they
had
to
hurry
and
i
guess
kent
there
an
got
a
fire
started
like
i
told
him
to
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
what
it
is
i
asked
him
if
he
would
ride
over
an
warm
up
the
house
and
i
see
there
a
smoke
all
she
looked
at
manley
and
then
turned
to
val
well
ai
you
goin
to
say
anything
you
dumb
both
of
you
val
took
a
deep
breath
we
should
be
dumb
she
said
contritely
we
should
go
down
on
our
knees
and
beg
their
pardon
and
yours
i
especially
i
think
i
never
in
my
life
felt
quite
so
humbled
so
overwhelmed
with
the
goodness
of
my
fellows
and
my
own
unworthiness
i
i
ca
put
it
into
words
all
the
resentment
i
have
felt
against
the
country
and
the
people
in
it
as
if
oh
tell
them
all
how
i
want
them
to
forgive
me
for
for
the
way
i
have
felt
and
there
now
i
did
bargain
for
you
to
make
it
so
serious
arline
expostulated
herself
near
to
crying
it
ai
nothing
much
us
folks
believe
in
helpin
when
help
needed
that
all
for
heaven
sake
go
cry
about
it
hank
pulled
up
at
the
gate
with
a
loud
and
a
grip
of
the
brake
from
the
kitchen
stovepipe
a
blue
ribbon
of
smoke
waved
high
in
the
clear
air
kent
appeared
grinning
amiably
in
the
doorway
but
val
was
looking
beyond
and
scarcely
saw
him
beyond
where
stood
a
new
stable
upon
the
ashes
of
the
old
a
new
corral
the
posts
standing
solidly
in
the
holes
dug
for
those
burned
away
a
new
haystack
when
hay
was
almost
priceless
a
few
chickens
wandered
about
near
the
stable
and
val
recognized
them
as
arline
prized
plymouth
rocks
small
wonder
that
she
and
manley
were
stunned
to
silence
manley
still
looked
as
if
some
one
had
dealt
him
an
unexpected
blow
in
the
face
val
was
white
and
together
they
walked
out
to
the
stable
when
they
stopped
she
put
her
hand
timidly
upon
his
aim
dear
she
said
softly
there
is
only
one
way
to
thank
them
for
this
and
that
is
to
be
the
very
best
it
is
in
us
to
be
we
will
wo
we
we
we
have
been
our
best
but
we
start
in
right
now
shall
we
manley
manley
looked
down
at
her
for
a
moment
saying
nothing
shall
we
manley
let
us
start
now
and
try
again
let
play
the
fire
burned
up
our
old
selves
and
we
all
new
and
strong
shall
we
and
we
wo
feel
any
resentment
for
what
is
past
but
we
work
together
and
think
together
and
talk
together
without
any
hidden
thing
we
discuss
freely
please
manley
he
knew
what
she
meant
well
enough
for
the
last
two
days
he
had
been
drinking
again
on
the
night
of
the
dance
he
had
barely
kept
within
the
limit
of
decent
behavior
he
had
read
val
complete
understanding
and
her
disgust
the
morning
after
and
since
then
they
had
barely
spoken
except
when
speech
was
necessary
oh
he
knew
what
she
meant
he
stood
for
another
minute
and
she
let
go
his
arm
and
stood
apart
watching
his
face
a
good
deal
depended
upon
the
next
minute
and
they
both
knew
it
and
hardly
breathed
his
hand
went
slowly
into
a
deep
pocket
of
his
overcoat
his
fingers
closed
over
something
and
drew
it
reluctantly
to
the
light
shamefaced
he
held
it
up
for
her
to
see
a
flat
bottle
of
generous
size
full
to
within
a
inch
of
the
cork
with
a
pale
yellow
liquid
there
take
it
and
break
it
into
a
million
pieces
he
said
huskily
i
try
her
eyes
darkened
perceptibly
manley
fleetwood
must
throw
it
away
this
is
your
fight
be
a
man
and
well
there
may
god
damn
me
forever
if
i
touch
liquor
again
i
through
with
the
stuff
for
keeps
he
held
the
bottle
high
without
looking
at
it
and
sent
it
crashing
against
the
stable
door
manley
she
stopped
her
ears
aghast
at
his
words
but
for
all
that
her
eyes
were
ashine
she
went
up
to
him
and
put
her
arms
around
him
now
we
can
start
all
over
again
she
said
we
count
our
lives
from
this
minute
dear
and
we
keep
them
clean
and
happy
oh
i
so
glad
so
glad
and
so
proud
dear
kent
had
got
down
the
path
from
the
house
he
stopped
when
manley
threw
the
bottle
and
waited
now
he
turned
abruptly
and
retraced
his
steps
and
he
did
not
look
particularly
happy
though
he
had
been
smiling
when
he
left
the
kitchen
arline
turned
from
the
window
as
he
entered
looks
like
man
has
swore
off

observed
dryly
well

pray
he

chapter
xv
a
compact
the
blackened
prairie
was
fast
hiding
the
mark
of
its
fire
torture
under
a
cloak
of
tender
new
grass
vividly
green
as
a
freshly
watered
lawn
meadow
larks
hopped
here
and
there
searching
long
for
a
sheltered
nesting
place
and
missing
the
weeds
where
they
were
wont
to
sway
and
swell
their
yellow
breasts
and
sing
at
the
sun
they
sang
just
as
happily
however
on
their
short
low
flights
over
the
levels
or
sitting
upon
gray
boulders
upon
some
barren
hilltop
spring
had
come
with
lavish
warmth
the
smoke
of
burning
ranges
the
bleak
winter
with
its
sweeping
storms
of
snow
and
wind
were
pushed
info
the
past
half
forgotten
in
this
new
heaven
and
new
earth
when
men
were
glad
simply
because
they
were
alive
on
a
still
sunday
morning
that
day
which
when
work
does
not
press
is
set
apart
in
the
range
land
for
slight
errands
attention
to
one
personal
affairs
and
to
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
kent
jogged
placidly
down
the
long
hill
into
cold
spring
coulee
and
pulled
up
at
the
familiar
little
unpainted
house
of
rough
boards
with
its
incongruously
dainty
curtains
at
the
windows
and
its
tiny
yard
green
and
scrupulously
clean
the
cat
with
white
spots
on
its
sides
was
washing
its
face
on
the
kitchen
doorstep
val
was
kneeling
beside
the
front
porch
painstakingly
stringing
white
grocery
twine
upon
nails
which
she
drove
into
the
rough
posts
with
a
small
rock
the
primitive
trellis
which
resulted
was
obviously
intended
for
the
future
encouragement
of
the
plants
just
unfolding
their
second
clusters
of
leaves
an
inch
above
ground
she
did
not
see
kent
at
first
and
he
sat
quiet
in
the
saddle
watching
her
with
a
flicker
of
amusement
in
his
eyes
but
in
a
moment
she
struck
her
finger
and
sprang
up
with
a
sharp
little
cry
throwing
the
rock
from
her
did
you
know
that
was
going
to
happen
sooner
or
later
kent
inquired
and
so
made
known
his
presence
oh
how
do
you
do
she
came
smiling
down
to
the
gate
holding
the
hurt
finger
tightly
clasped
in
the
other
hand
how
comes
it
you
are
riding
this
way
our
trail
is
all
growing
up
to
grass
so
few
ever
travel
we
all
folks
these
days
where
man
manley
is
down
to
the
river
i
she
rested
both
arms
upon
the
gatepost
and
regarded
him
with
her
steady
eyes
if
you
can
wait
he
will
be
back
soon
he
only
went
to
see
if
the
river
is
fordable
he
thinks
two
or
three
of
our
horses
are
on
the
other
side
and
he
like
to
get
them
the
river
has
been
too
high
but
it
lowering
rather
fast
wo
you
come
in
she
was
pleasant
she
was
unusually
friendly
but
kent
felt
vaguely
that
somehow
she
was
different
he
had
not
seen
her
for
three
months
just
after
christmas
he
had
met
her
and
manley
in
town
when
he
was
about
to
leave
for
a
visit
to
his
people
in
nebraska
he
had
returned
only
a
week
or
so
before
and
if
the
truth
were
known
he
was
not
displeased
at
the
errand
which
brought
him
this
way
he
dismounted
and
when
she
moved
away
from
the
gate
he
opened
it
and
went
in
well
he
began
lightly
when
he
was
seated
upon
the
floor
of
the
porch
and
she
was
back
at
her
trellis
and
how
the
world
been
using
you
had
any
more
calamities
while
i
been
gone
she
busied
herself
with
tying
together
two
pieces
of
string
so
that
the
whole
would
reach
to
a
certain
nail
driven
higher
than
her
head
she
stood
with
both
hands
uplifted
and
her
face
and
her
eyes
she
did
not
reply
for
so
long
that
kent
began
to
wonder
if
she
had
heard
him
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
watch
her
so
intently
or
why
he
should
want
to
get
up
and
push
back
the
one
lock
of
hair
which
seemed
always
in
rebellion
and
always
falling
across
her
temple
by
itself
he
was
drifting
into
a
dreamy
wonder
that
all
women
with
hair
should
not
be
given
eyes
also
and
to
wishing
vaguely
that
it
might
be
his
luck
to
meet
one
some
time
one
who
was
not
married
when
she
looked
down
at
him
quite
unexpectedly
he
was
startled
and
half
ashamed
and
afraid
that
she
might
not
like
what
he
had
been
thinking
she
was
staring
straight
into
his
eyes
and
he
knew
that
she
was
thinking
of
something
that
affected
her
a
good
deal
unless
it
a
calamity
to
discover
that
the
world
is
what
it
is
and
people
in
it
are
what
they
are
and
that
you
have
been
a
blind
idiot
is
that
a
calamity
mr
cowboy
or
is
it
a
blessing
i
been
kent
discovered
when
he
started
to
speak
that
he
had
run
short
of
breath
i
reckon
that
depends
on
how
the
discovery
pans
out
he
ventured
after
a
moment
he
was
not
looking
at
her
then
for
some
reason
unexplained
to
himself
he
felt
that
it
was
right
for
him
to
look
at
her
nor
wise
nor
quite
pleasant
in
its
effect
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
she
meant
but
he
knew
very
well
that
she
meant
something
more
than
to
make
conversation
that
she
said
and
gave
a
little
sigh
that
takes
so
long
you
know
the
panning
out
as
you
call
it
it
hard
to
see
things
very
clearly
and
to
make
a
decision
that
you
know
is
going
to
stand
the
test
and
then
just
sit
down
and
fold
your
hands
because
some
sordid
petty
little
reason
absolutely
prevents
your
doing
anything
i
hate
waiting
for
anything
do
you
when
i
want
to
do
a
thing
i
want
to
do
it
immediately
these
now
i
fixed
the
trellis
for
them
to
climb
upon
i
resent
it
because
they
do
take
hold
right
now
nasty
little
things
two
inches
high
when
they
should
be
two
yards
and
all
covered
with
beautiful
illustration
little
woman
listen
here
he
said
you
playing
hard
luck
and
i
know
it
not
the
last
of
april
he
qualified
give
a
fair
chance
ca
you
they
make
it
all
right
things
take
she
laughed
surrenderingly
and
came
and
sat
down
upon
the
porch
near
him
and
tapped
a
slipper
toe
nervously
upon
the
soft
green
sod
time
yes
she
threw
back
her
head
and
smiled
at
him
brightly
and
appealingly
it
seemed
to
kent
you
remember
what
you
told
me
once
about
and
going
crazy
out
here
the
is
sometimes
ready
to
agree
with
she
turned
her
head
with
a
quick
impatience
such
is
learning
to
ride
a
horse
she
informed
him
airily
such
does
it
on
the
sly
and
she
fell
off
once
and
skinned
her
elbow
and
she
well
such
has
any
sidesaddle
but
she
learning
granny
kent
laughed
unsteadily
and
looked
sidelong
at
her
with
eyes
alight
she
matched
the
glance
for
just
about
one
second
and
turned
her
eyes
away
with
a
certain
consciousness
that
gave
kent
a
savage
delight
of
a
truth
she
was
different
she
was
human
she
was
intolerably
alluring
she
was
not
the
prim
perfectly
young
woman
he
had
met
at
the
train
lonesome
land
was
doing
its
work
she
was
beginning
to
think
as
an
individual
as
a
woman
not
merely
as
a
member
of
conventional
society
such
is
beginning
to
be
the
proper
stuff
granny
he
told
her
softly
he
was
afraid
his
tone
had
offended
her
she
rose
and
her
color
flared
and
faded
she
leaned
slightly
against
the
post
beside
her
and
with
a
hand
thrown
up
and
half
shielding
her
face
she
stared
out
across
the
coulee
to
the
hill
beyond
did
you
i
feel
like
a
fool
for
talking
like
this
but
one
sometimes
clutches
at
the
least
glimmer
of
sympathy
and
and
understanding
and
speaks
what
should
be
kept
bottled
up
inside
i
suppose
but
i
been
bottled
up
for
so
she
struck
her
free
hand
suddenly
against
her
lips
as
if
she
would
apply
physical
force
to
keep
them
from
losing
all
when
she
spoke
again
her
voice
was
calmer
did
you
ever
get
to
the
point
mr
cowboy
where
you
you
dug
right
down
to
the
bottom
of
things
and
found
that
you
must
do
something
or
go
mad
and
there
was
a
thing
you
could
do
did
you
ever
she
did
not
turn
toward
him
but
kept
her
eyes
to
the
hills
when
he
did
not
answer
however
she
swung
her
head
slowly
and
looked
down
at
him
where
he
sat
almost
at
her
feet
kent
was
leaning
forward
studying
the
gashes
he
had
cut
in
the
sod
with
his
spurs
his
brows
were
knitted
close
i
kinda
think
i
getting
there
pretty
fast
he
owned
gravely
when
he
felt
her
gaze
upon
him
why
oh
because
you
can
understand
how
one
must
speak
sometimes
ever
since
i
came
you
have
been
i
do
know
different
at
first
i
did
like
you
at
all
but
i
could
see
you
were
different
since
then
well
you
have
now
and
then
said
something
that
made
me
see
one
could
speak
to
you
and
you
would
understand
so
i
she
broke
off
suddenly
and
laughed
an
apology
am
i
boring
you
dreadfully
one
grows
so
living
alone
if
you
are
interested
i
kent
was
obliged
to
clear
his
throat
to
get
those
two
words
out
go
on
say
all
you
want
to
she
laughed
again
wearily
lately
she
confessed
nervously
i
taken
to
telling
my
thoughts
to
the
cat
it
perfectly
safe
but
after
all
it
is
quite
she
stopped
again
and
stood
silent
for
a
moment
it
because
i
am
alone
day
after
day
week
in
and
week
out
she
went
on
in
a
way
i
do
mind
it
under
the
circumstances
i
prefer
to
be
alone
really
i
mean
i
would
want
any
of
my
people
near
me
but
one
has
too
much
time
to
think
i
tell
you
this
because
i
feel
i
ought
to
let
you
know
that
you
were
right
that
time
i
do
suppose
you
even
remember
it
but
i
do
once
last
fall
the
first
time
you
came
to
the
ranch
you
know
the
time
i
met
you
at
the
spring
you
seemed
to
see
that
this
big
lonesome
country
was
a
little
too
much
for
me
i
resented
it
then
i
want
any
one
to
tell
me
what
i
refused
to
admit
to
myself
i
was
trying
so
hard
to
like
it
it
seemed
my
only
hope
you
see
but
now
i
tell
you
you
were
right
sometimes
i
feel
very
wicked
about
it
sometimes
i
do
care
and
sometimes
i
i
feel
i
shall
go
crazy
if
i
ca
talk
to
some
one
nobody
comes
here
except
polycarp
jenks
the
only
woman
i
know
really
well
in
the
country
is
arline
hawley
she
good
as
gold
but
she
intensely
practical
you
ca
tell
her
your
troubles
not
unless
they
concrete
and
have
to
do
with
your
physical
arline
lacks
she
laughed
again
shortly
i
do
know
why
i
taking
it
for
granted
you
do
she
said
you
think
i
talking
pore
nonsense
do
you
mr
cowboy
she
turned
full
toward
him
and
her
eyes
challenged
him
begged
him
for
sympathy
and
understanding
held
him
at
bay
but
most
of
all
they
set
his
blood
pounding
sullenly
in
his
veins
he
got
unsteadily
to
his
feet
you
seem
to
pass
up
a
lot
of
things
that
count
or
you
would
say
that
he
reminded
her
huskily
that
night
in
town
just
after
the
fire
for
instance
and
here
that
same
afternoon
i
tried
to
jolly
you
out
of
feeling
bad
both
those
times
but
you
know
i
understood
you
know
i
understood
and
you
know
i
was
sorry
and
if
you
do
know
do
anything
on
god
green
earth
he
turned
sharply
away
from
her
and
stood
kicking
savagely
backward
at
a
clod
with
his
rowel
then
he
felt
her
hand
touch
his
arm
and
started
after
that
he
stood
perfectly
still
except
that
he
quivered
like
a
frightened
horse
oh
it
does
mean
much
to
you
you
have
your
life
and
you
a
man
and
can
do
things
when
you
want
to
but
i
do
so
need
a
friend
just
somebody
who
understands
to
whom
i
can
talk
when
that
is
the
only
thing
will
keep
me
sane
you
saved
my
life
once
so
i
feel
no
i
do
mean
that
it
because
of
anything
you
did
it
just
that
i
feel
i
can
talk
to
you
more
freely
than
to
any
one
i
know
i
do
mean
whine
i
hope
i
not
a
whiner
if
i
blundered
i
willing
to
to
take
my
medicine
as
you
would
say
but
if
i
can
feel
that
somewhere
in
this
big
empty
country
just
one
person
will
always
feel
kindly
toward
me
and
wish
me
well
and
be
sorry
for
we
when
i
when
i
miserable
and
she
could
not
go
on
she
pressed
her
lips
together
tightly
and
winked
back
the
tears
kent
faced
about
and
laid
both
his
hands
upon
her
shoulders
his
face
was
very
tender
and
rather
sad
and
if
she
had
only
understood
as
well
as
he
did
but
she
did
not
little
woman
listen
here
he
said
you
playing
hard
luck
and
i
know
it
maybe
i
do
know
just
how
hard
but
maybe
i
can
kinda
give
a
guess
if
you
think
of
me
as
your
friend
your
pal
and
if
you
always
tell
yourself
that
your
pal
is
going
to
stand
by
you
no
matter
what
comes
why
all
he
caught
his
breath
she
smiled
up
at
him
honestly
pleased
wholly
without
guile
and
wholly
blind
i
rather
have
such
a
friend
just
now
than
anything
i
know
except
but
if
your
sweetheart
should
object
could
you
his
fingers
gripped
her
shoulders
tighter
for
just
a
second
and
he
let
her
go
i
guess
that
part
be
all
right
he
rejoined
in
a
tone
she
could
not
quite
fathom
i
never
had
one
in
m
why
you
poor
thing
she
stood
back
and
tilted
her
head
at
him
you
poor
i
have
to
see
about
that
immediately
every
young
man
wants
a
sweetheart
at
least
all
the
young
men
i
ever
knew
wanted
one
and
and
i
gamble
they
all
wanted
the
same
one
he
hinted
wickedly
feeling
himself
unreasonably
happy
over
something
he
could
not
quite
put
into
words
even
if
he
had
dared
oh
no
hardly
ever
the
same
one
luckily
do
you
know
pal
i
quite
forgotten
what
it
was
all
about
the
unburdening
of
my
soul
i
mean
after
all
i
think
i
must
have
been
just
lonesome
the
country
is
just
as
big
but
it
is
quite
so
so
you
see
are
you
awfully
vain
to
see
how
you
have
peopled
it
with
your
friendship
she
clasped
her
hands
behind
her
and
regarded
him
speculatively
i
hope
mr
cowboy
you
in
earnest
about
this
she
observed
doubtfully
i
hope
you
have
imagination
enough
to
see
it
is
silly
because
if
i
suspected
you
were
playing
fair
and
would
go
away
and
laugh
at
me
i
scratch
she
nodded
her
head
slowly
at
him
i
always
been
told
that
with
tiger
eyes
you
find
the
disposition
of
a
tiger
so
if
you
do
mean
it
you
better
let
me
know
at
kent
brought
the
color
into
her
cheeks
with
his
steady
gaze
i
was
just
getting
scared
did
mean
it
he
averred
if
my
pal
goes
back
on
me
why
lord
help
her
she
took
a
slow
deep
breath
how
is
it
you
men
ratify
a
solemn
agreement
she
puzzled
oh
with
a
pretty
impulse
she
held
out
her
right
hand
half
grave
half
playful
shake
on
it
pal
kent
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
as
hard
as
he
dared
you
going
to
be
a
dandy
little
chum
he
predicted
gamely
but
let
me
tell
you
right
now
if
you
ever
get
up
on
your
stilts
with
me
there
going
to
be
all
kinds
of
trouble
you
call
me
kent
that
is
he
qualified
with
a
little
unsteady
laugh
when
there
ai
any
one
around
to
get
i
suppose
this
quite
conventional
she
conceded
as
if
the
thought
had
just
then
occurred
to
her
but
thank
goodness
out
here
there
are
any
conventions
every
one
lives
as
every
one
sees
fit
it
is
the
best
thing
for
some
people
she
added
drearily
some
people
have
to
be
bolstered
up
by
conventions
or
they
ca
help
miring
in
their
own
weaknesses
but
we
do
and
as
long
as
we
understand
she
looked
to
him
for
confirmation
as
long
as
we
understand
why
it
ai
anybody
business
but
our
own
he
declared
steadily
she
seemed
relieved
of
some
lingering
doubt
that
exactly
it
i
know
why
i
should
deny
myself
a
friend
just
because
that
friend
happens
to
be
a
man
and
i
happen
to
be
married
i
never
did
have
much
patience
with
the
rule
that
a
man
must
either
be
perfectly
indifferent
or
else
make
love
i
so
glad
you
understand
so
that
all
settled
she
finished
briskly
and
i
find
that
as
i
said
it
is
at
all
necessary
for
me
to
unburden
my
they
stood
quiet
for
a
moment
their
thoughts
too
intangible
for
speech
come
inside
wo
you
she
invited
at
last
coming
back
to
everyday
matters
of
course
you
hungry
or
you
ought
to
be
you
dare
run
away
from
my
cooking
this
time
mr
cowboy
manley
will
be
back
soon
i
think
i
must
get
some
lunch
kent
replied
that
he
would
stay
outside
and
smoke
so
she
left
him
with
a
fleeting
smile
infinitely
friendly
and
confiding
and
glad
he
turned
and
looked
after
her
soberly
gave
a
great
sigh
and
reached
mechanically
for
his
tobacco
and
papers
thoughtfully
rolled
a
cigarette
lighted
it
and
held
the
match
until
it
burned
quite
down
to
his
thumb
and
fingers
pals
he
said
just
under
his
breath
for
the
mere
sound
of
the
word
all
right
pals
it
is
he
smoked
slowly
listening
to
her
moving
about
in
the
house
her
steps
came
nearer
he
turned
to
look
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
see
manley
about
she
asked
him
from
the
doorway
i
just
happened
to
wonder
what
it
could
well
the
wishbone
needs
men
and
sent
me
over
to
tell
him
he
can
go
to
work
the
wagons
are
going
to
start
he
want
to
gather
his
cattle
up
and
of
course
we
know
about
how
he
fixed
for
saddle
horses
and
the
like
he
can
work
for
the
outfit
and
draw
wages
and
get
his
cattle
thrown
back
on
this
range
and
his
calves
branded
besides
get
paid
for
doing
what
he
have
to
do
anyhow
you
i
val
pushed
back
the
rebellious
lock
of
hair
of
course
you
suggested
the
idea
to
the
wishbone
you
always
doing
something
the
outfit
is
he
reiterated
they
need
him
they
straining
a
point
to
do
man
a
favor
do
you
ever
think
it
well
coming
he
broke
off
and
started
to
the
gate
manley
clattered
up
vociferously
glad
to
greet
him
kent
at
his
urgent
invitation
led
his
horse
to
the
stable
and
turned
him
into
the
corral
unsaddled
and
unbridled
him
so
that
he
could
eat
also
he
told
his
errand
manley
interrupted
the
conversation
to
produce
a
bottle
of
whisky
from
a
cunningly
concealed
hole
in
the
depleted
haystack
and
insisted
that
kent
should
take
a
drink
kent
waved
it
off
and
manley
drew
the
cork
and
held
the
bottle
to
his
own
lips
as
he
stood
there
with
his
face
uplifted
while
the
yellow
liquor
gurgled
down
his
throat
kent
watched
him
with
a
curiously
detached
interest
so
that
how
manley
had
kept
his
vow
he
was
thinking
with
an
impersonal
contempt
four
good
swallows
kent
counted
them
you
hitting
it
pretty
strong
man
for
a
fellow
that
swore
off
last
fall
he
commented
aloud
manley
took
down
the
bottle
gave
a
sigh
of
pure
animal
satisfaction
and
pushed
the
cork
in
with
an
unconsciously
regretful
movement
a
fellow
got
to
get
something
out
of
life
he
defended
peevishly
had
pretty
hard
luck
it
enough
to
drive
a
fellow
to
most
any
kind
of
relief
burnt
out
last
fall
cattle
scattered
and
calves
running
the
range
all
winter
i
have
got
stock
enough
to
stand
that
sort
of
a
deal
kent
no
telling
where
i
stand
now
on
the
cattle
question
i
did
have
close
to
a
hundred
head
and
three
of
my
best
geldings
are
missing
a
poor
man
stand
luck
like
that
i
in
debt
too
and
when
you
got
an
iceberg
in
the
house
when
a
man
own
wife
do
stand
by
him
when
he
ca
get
any
sympathy
from
the
very
one
that
ought
to
but
then
i
hope
i
a
gentleman
i
do
make
any
kick
against
my
domestic
affairs
are
my
own
affairs
sure
but
when
your
wife
freezes
up
solid
he
held
the
bottle
up
and
looked
at
it
best
friend
i
got
he
finished
with
a
whining
note
in
his
voice
kent
turned
away
disgusted
manley
had
coarsened
he
had
slopped
down
just
when
he
should
have
braced
up
and
caught
the
fighting
spirit
the
spirit
that
fights
and
overcomes
obstacles
with
a
tightening
of
his
chest
he
thought
of
his
pal
tied
for
life
to
this
whining
drunkard
no
wonder
she
felt
the
need
of
a
friend
well
are
you
going
out
with
the
wishbone
he
asked
tersely
jerking
his
thoughts
back
to
his
errand
if
you
are
you
need
to
go
over
there
the
wagons
start
out
maybe
you
better
ride
around
by
polly
place
and
have
him
come
over
here
once
in
a
while
to
look
after
things
you
ca
leave
your
wife
alone
without
somebody
to
kinda
keep
an
eye
out
for
her
you
know
polycarp
ai
going
to
ride
this
spring
got
rheumatism
or
some
darned
thing
but
he
can
chop
what
wood
need
and
go
to
town
for
her
once
in
a
while
and
make
sure
she
all
right
you
better
leave
your
gentlest
horse
here
for
her
to
use
too
she
ca
be
left
afoot
out
manley
was
taking
another
long
swallow
from
the
bottle
but
he
heard
why
sure
i
never
thought
about
that
i
guess
maybe
i
better
get
polycarp
but
val
could
make
out
all
right
alone
why
she
held
it
down
here
for
a
week
at
a
time
last
winter
when
i
forgot
to
come
home
he
winked
shamelessly
or
a
storm
would
come
up
so
i
could
get
home
val
is
like
some
fool
women
i
say
that
much
for
her
she
do
care
whether
i
around
or
not
fact
is
sometimes
i
think
she
better
pleased
when
i
gone
but
you
right
i
see
polycarp
and
have
him
come
over
once
in
a
while
sure
glad
you
spoke
of
it
you
always
had
a
great
head
for
thinking
about
other
people
kent
you
ought
to
get
no
thanks
kent
scowled
i
have
got
any
grudge
against
women
the
world
full
of
men
ready
and
willing
to
give
a
taste
of
pure
unadulterated
manley
stared
at
him
stupidly
and
then
laughed
doubtfully
as
if
he
felt
certain
of
having
by
his
dullness
missed
the
point
of
a
very
good
joke
after
that
the
time
was
filled
with
the
preparations
for
manley
absence
kent
did
what
he
could
to
help
and
val
went
calmly
about
the
house
packing
the
few
necessary
personal
belongings
which
might
be
stuffed
into
a
war
bag
and
used
during
beyond
an
occasional
glance
of
friendly
understanding
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
compact
she
had
made
with
kent
but
when
they
were
ready
to
ride
away
kent
purposely
left
his
gloves
lying
upon
the
couch
and
remembered
them
only
after
manley
was
in
the
saddle
so
he
went
back
and
val
followed
him
into
the
room
he
wanted
to
say
something
he
did
not
quite
know
what
something
that
would
bring
them
a
little
closer
together
and
keep
them
so
something
that
would
make
her
think
of
him
often
and
kindly
he
picked
up
his
gloves
and
held
out
his
hand
to
her
and
then
a
diffidence
seized
his
tongue
there
was
nothing
he
dared
say
all
the
eloquence
all
the
tenderness
was
in
his
eyes
well
pal
be
good
to
yourself
he
said
simply
val
smiled
up
at
him
tremulously
my
one
friend
do
do
get
hurt
their
clasp
tightened
their
hands
dropped
apart
rather
limply
kent
went
out
and
got
upon
his
horse
and
rode
away
beside
manley
and
talked
of
the
range
and
of
the
and
of
cattle
and
a
dozen
other
things
which
interest
men
but
all
the
while
one
exultant
thought
kept
reiterating
itself
in
his
mind
she
never
said
that
much
to
she
never
said
that
much
to
chapter
xvi
manley
new
tactics
to
the
east
to
the
south
to
the
north
went
the
riders
of
the
wishbone
gathering
the
cattle
which
the
fires
had
driven
afar
no
rivers
stopped
them
nor
mountains
nor
the
coulees
nor
the
plains
it
was
manley
first
experience
in
real
work
for
his
own
little
herd
he
had
managed
to
keep
close
at
home
and
what
few
strayed
afar
were
turned
back
when
opportunity
afforded
by
his
neighbors
who
wished
him
well
now
he
tasted
the
pride
of
ownership
to
the
full
when
a
vp
cow
and
her
calf
mingled
with
the
milling
wishbones
and
double
diamonds
he
was
proud
of
his
brand
and
proud
of
the
sentiment
which
had
made
him
choose
val
initials
more
than
once
he
explained
to
his
fellows
that
vp
meant
val
peyson
and
that
he
had
got
it
recorded
just
after
he
and
val
were
engaged
he
was
not
sentimental
about
her
now
but
he
liked
to
dwell
upon
the
fact
that
he
had
been
it
showed
that
he
was
capable
of
fine
feeling
more
dominant
however
as
the
weeks
passed
and
the
branding
went
on
became
the
desire
to
accumulate
property
cattle
the
wishbone
brand
went
scorching
through
the
hair
of
hundreds
of
calves
while
the
vp
scared
tens
it
was
not
right
he
felt
somehow
cheated
by
fate
he
mentally
figured
the
increase
of
his
herd
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
took
a
long
while
much
longer
than
it
should
to
gain
a
respectable
number
in
that
manner
he
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
some
rich
acquaintance
in
the
east
who
might
be
prevailed
upon
to
lend
him
capital
enough
to
buy
say
five
hundred
cows
he
began
to
talk
about
it
occasionally
when
the
boys
lay
around
in
the
evenings
you
want
to
ride
with
a
long
rope
suggested
bob
royden
grinning
openly
at
the
others
that
the
way
to
work
up
in
the
cow
business
capital
nothing
you
do
get
enough
excitement
buying
cattle
you
want
to
steal
that
what
i
do
if
i
had
a
brand
of
my
own
and
all
your
ambitions
to
get
and
get
sent
up
manley
rounded
out
the
situation
no
he
laughed
it
a
better
way
to
get
to
the
pen
than
it
is
to
get
rich
from
all
sandy
moran
remembered
a
fellow
who
worked
a
brand
and
kept
it
up
for
seven
or
eight
years
before
they
caught
him
and
he
recounted
the
tale
between
puffs
at
his
cigarette
only
they
did
catch
him
he
finished
a
puncher
put
him
wise
to
what
was
in
the
wind
and
he
sold
out
cheap
to
a
tenderfoot
and
pulled
his
freight
they
never
did
locate
then
with
a
pointed
rock
which
he
picked
up
beside
him
he
drew
a
rude
diagram
or
two
in
the
dirt
that
how
he
done
it
he
explained
pretty
smooth
so
the
talk
went
on
as
such
things
will
idly
without
purpose
save
to
pass
the
time
shop
talk
of
the
range
it
was
tales
of
stealing
of
working
brands
and
of
branding
unmarked
yearlings
at
weaning
time
of
this
big
cattleman
and
that
who
practically
stole
whole
herds
and
thereby
took
long
strides
toward
wealth
range
scandals
grown
old
range
gossip
all
of
it
of
men
who
had
changed
a
brand
or
made
one
using
a
cinch
ring
at
a
tiny
fire
in
a
secluded
hollow
or
a
spur
or
a
jackknife
who
were
caught
in
the
act

or
merely
suspected
of
the

hangings
even
and
getaways
spectacular
and
humorous
and
pathetic
manley
being
in
a
measure
a
pilgrim
and
having
no
experience
to
draw
upon
and
not
much
imagination
took
no
part
in
the
talk
except
that
he
listened
and
was
intensely
interested
two
months
of
mingling
with
men
who
talked
little
else
had
its
influence
that
fall
when
manley
had
his
hay
up
and
his
cattle
once
more
ranging
close
toward
the
river
and
in
the
broken
country
bounded
upon
the
west
by
the
railroad
three
calves
bore
the
vp
brand
three
husky
heifers
that
never
had
suckled
a
vp
mother
so
had
the
range
gossip
sown
by
chance
in
the
soil
of
his
greed
of
gain
and
his
weakening
moral
fiber
borne
fruit
the
deed
scared
him
sober
for
a
month
for
a
month
his
color
changed
and
his
blood
quickened
whenever
a
horseman
showed
upon
the
rim
of
cold
spring
coulee
for
a
month
he
never
left
the
ranch
unless
business
compelled
him
to
do
so
and
his
return
was
speedy
his
eyes
anxious
until
he
knew
that
all
was
well
after
that
his
confidence
returned
he
grew
more
secretive
more
more
at
ease
with
his
guilt
he
looked
the
wishbone
men
squarely
in
the
eye
and
it
seldom
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
a
thief
or
if
it
did
the
word
was
but
a
synonym
for
luck
with
shrewdness
behind
sometimes
he
regretted
his
timidity
why
three
calves
only
in
a
deep
little
coulee
next
the
river
a
coulee
which
the
had
missed
had
been
more
than
three
he
might
have
doubled
the
number
and
risked
no
more
than
for
the
three
the
longer
he
dwelt
upon
that
the
more
inclined
he
was
to
feel
that
he
had
cheated
himself
that
fall
there
were
no
fires
it
would
be
long
before
men
grew
careless
when
the
grass
was
ripened
and
the
winds
blew
hot
and
dry
from
out
the
west
the
big
prairie
which
lay
high
between
the
river
and
hope
was
dotted
with
feeding
cattle
wishbones
and
double
diamonds
mostly
with
here
and
there
a
stray
manley
grew
wily
and
began
to
plan
far
in
advance
he
rode
here
and
there
quietly
keeping
his
own
cattle
well
down
toward
the
river
there
was
shelter
there
and
feed
and
the
idea
was
a
good
one
just
before
the
river
broke
up
he
saw
to
it
that
a
few
of
his
own
cattle
and
with
them
some
wishbone
cows
and
a
steer
or
two
were
ranging
in
a
deep
bushy
coulee
isolated
and
easily
passed
by
he
had
driven
them
there
and
he
left
them
there
that
spring
he
worked
again
with
the
wishbone
when
the
swept
the
home
range
gathering
and
branding
it
chanced
that
his
part
of
the
circle
took
him
and
sandy
moran
down
that
way
it
was
hot
and
they
had
thirty
or
forty
head
of
cattle
before
them
when
they
neared
that
particular
place
no
need
going
down
into
the
breaks
here
he
told
sandy
easily
been
hazing
out
everything
i
came
across
lately
they
were
mostly
my
own
anyway
i
believe
i
got
it
pretty
well
cleaned
up
along
sandy
was
not
the
man
to
hunt
hard
riding
he
went
to
the
rim
of
the
coulee
and
looked
down
for
a
minute
he
saw
nothing
moving
and
took
manley
word
for
it
with
no
stirring
of
his
conscience
he
said
all
right
and
rode
on
chapter
xvii
val
becomes
an
author
quite
as
marked
had
been
the
change
in
val
that
year
every
time
kent
saw
her
he
recognized
the
fact
that
she
was
a
little
different
a
little
less
superior
in
her
attitude
a
little
more
independent
in
her
views
of
life
her
standards
seemed
slowly
changing
and
her
way
of
thinking
he
did
not
see
her
often
but
when
he
did
the
mockery
of
their
friendship
struck
him
more
keenly
his
inward
rebellion
against
circumstances
grew
more
bitter
he
wondered
how
she
could
be
so
blind
as
to
think
they
were
just
pals
and
no
more
she
did
think
so
all
the
little
confidences
all
the
glances
all
the
smiles
she
gave
and
received
frankly
in
the
name
of
friendship
you
know
kent
this
is
my
ideal
of
how
people
should
be
she
told
him
once
with
a
perfectly
honest
enthusiasm
i
always
dreamed
of
such
a
friendship
and
i
always
believed
that
some
day
the
right
man
would
come
along
and
make
it
possible
not
one
in
a
thousand
could
understand
and
meet
one
they
be
liable
to
go
farther
kent
assented
dryly
yes
that
just
the
trouble
they
spoil
an
ideal
friendship
by
falling
in
darned
chumps
kent
classed
them
sweepingly
exactly
pal
your
vocabulary
excites
my
envy
it
so
forcible
kent
grinned
reminiscently
it
sure
is
old
oh
i
do
mean
necessarily
profane
i
wonder
what
your
vocabulary
will
do
to
the
secret
i
going
to
tell
the
had
reached
the
desired
height
and
profusion
of
blossoms
thanks
to
the
pails
and
pails
of
water
val
had
carried
and
lavished
upon
them
and
she
was
gathering
a
handful
of
the
prettiest
blooms
for
him
her
cheeks
turned
a
bit
pinker
as
she
spoke
and
her
hesitation
raised
a
wild
hope
briefly
in
kent
heart
what
is
it
he
had
to
force
the
words
out
i
i
hate
to
tell
but
i
want
you
to
to
help
well
to
kent
at
that
moment
she
was
not
manley
wife
she
was
not
any
man
wife
she
was
the
girl
he
loved
loved
with
the
primitive
absorbing
passion
of
the
man
who
lives
naturally
and
does
not
borrow
his
morals
from
his
neighbor
his
code
of
ethics
was
his
own
thought
out
by
himself
val
hated
her
husband
and
her
husband
did
not
seem
to
care
much
for
her
they
were
tied
together
legally
and
a
mere
legality
could
not
hold
back
the
emotions
and
the
desires
of
kent
burnett
with
him
it
was
not
a
question
of
morals
it
was
a
question
of
val
feeling
in
the
matter
val
looked
up
at
him
found
something
strange
in
his
eyes
and
immediately
looked
away
again
your
eyes
are
always
saying
things
i
ca
hear
she
observed
irrelevantly
are
they
do
you
want
me
to
act
as
interpreter
no
i
just
want
you
to
listen
have
you
noticed
anything
different
about
me
lately
kent
she
tilted
her
head
while
she
passed
judgment
upon
a
cluster
of
speckled
blossoms
odd
but
not
particularly
pretty
what
do
you
mean
anyway
i
liable
to
get
off
wrong
if
i
tell
you
oh
you
so
horribly
cautious
have
i
seemed
any
more
content
any
happier
lately
kent
picked
a
spray
of
flowers
and
puled
them
ruthlessly
to
pieces
maybe
i
kinda
hoped
so
he
said
almost
in
a
whisper
well
i
a
new
interest
in
life
i
just
discovered
it
by
accident
almost
kent
lifted
his
head
and
looked
keenly
at
her
and
his
face
was
a
lighter
shade
of
brown
than
it
had
been
it
seems
to
change
everything
pal
i
i
been
writing
kent
discovered
he
had
been
holding
his
breath
and
let
it
go
in
a
long
sigh
oh
after
a
minute
he
smiled
philosophically
what
kinda
things
he
drawled
well
verses
but
mostly
stories
you
see
she
explained
impulsively
i
want
to
earn
some
money
of
my
own
i
have
said
much
because
i
hate
whining
but
really
things
are
growing
pretty
bad
between
manley
and
me
i
hope
it
is
my
fault
i
have
tried
every
way
i
know
to
keep
my
faith
in
him
and
to
to
help
him
but
he
not
the
same
as
he
was
you
know
that
and
i
have
a
good
deal
of
pride
i
ca
oh
it
intolerable
having
to
ask
a
man
for
money
especially
when
he
does
want
to
give
you
any
she
added
naively
at
first
it
was
necessary
i
had
a
little
of
my
own
and
all
my
things
were
new
but
one
must
eventually
buy
things
for
the
house
you
know
and
for
one
personal
needs
and
he
seems
to
resent
it
dreadfully
i
never
would
have
believed
that
manley
could
be
stingy
actually
stingy
but
he
is
unfortunately
i
hate
to
speak
of
his
faults
even
to
you
but
i
got
to
be
honest
with
you
it
is
nice
to
say
that
i
writing
not
for
any
particularly
burning
desire
to
express
my
thoughts
nor
for
the
sentiment
of
it
but
to
earn
money
it
terribly
sordid
is
it
she
smiled
wistfully
up
at
him
but
there
seems
to
be
money
in
it
for
those
who
succeed
and
it
work
that
i
can
do
here
i
have
oceans
of
time
and
i
not
disturbed
her
lips
curved
into
bitter
lines
i
do
so
much
thinking
i
might
as
well
put
my
brain
to
some
with
one
of
her
sudden
changes
of
mood
she
turned
to
kent
and
clasped
both
hands
upon
his
arm
now
you
see
pal
how
much
our
friendship
means
to
me
she
said
softly
i
could
have
told
this
to
another
living
soul
it
seems
awfully
treacherous
saying
it
even
to
you
i
mean
about
him
but
you
so
good
you
always
understand
do
you
pal
i
guess
kent
forced
the
words
out
naturally
and
kept
his
breath
even
and
his
arms
from
clasping
her
he
considered
that
he
performed
quite
a
feat
of
endurance
you
modest
she
gave
his
arm
a
little
shake
of
course
you
do
you
know
i
not
treacherous
really
you
know
i
do
anything
i
could
for
him
but
this
is
something
that
does
concern
him
at
all
he
does
know
it
but
that
is
because
he
would
only
sneer
when
i
have
really
sold
something
and
received
the
money
for
it
then
it
wo
matter
to
me
who
knows
but
now
it
a
solemn
secret
just
between
me
and
my
her
eyes
dwelt
upon
his
face
kent
stealing
a
glance
at
her
from
under
his
drooped
lids
wondered
if
she
had
ever
given
any
time
to
analyzing
herself
he
would
have
given
much
to
know
if
down
deep
in
her
heart
she
really
believed
in
this
pal
business
if
she
was
really
a
friend
and
no
more
she
puzzled
him
a
good
deal
sometimes
well
if
anybody
can
make
good
at
that
business
you
sure
ought
to
you
got
brains
enough
to
write
a
he
permitted
himself
the
indulgence
of
saying
that
much
and
he
was
perfectly
sincere
he
honestly
considered
val
the
cleverest
woman
in
the
world
she
laughed
with
gratification
your
sublime
confidence
while
it
is
undoubtedly
mistaken
is
nevertheless
appreciated
she
told
him
primly
moving
away
with
her
hands
full
of
flowers
if
you
got
the
nerve
come
inside
and
read
some
of
my
stuff
i
want
to
know
if
it
any
good
at
presently
he
was
seated
upon
the
couch
in
the
little
pathetically
bright
front
room
and
he
was
knitting
his
eyebrows
over
val
beautifully
regular
handwriting
pages
and
pages
of
it
so
that
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
task
and
was
trying
to
give
his
mind
to
what
he
was
reading
instead
of
to
the
author
sitting
near
him
with
her
hands
folded
demurely
in
her
lap
and
her
eyes
fixed
expectantly
upon
his
face
trying
to
read
his
decision
even
as
it
was
forming
some
verses
she
had
tried
on
him
first
kent
by
using
all
his
determination
of
character
read
them
all
every
word
of
them
that
sure
all
right
he
said
though
beyond
a
telling
phrase
or
two
one
line
in
particular
which
would
stick
in
his
memory
men
live
and
love
and
die
in
that
lonely
land
he
had
no
very
clear
idea
of
what
it
was
all
about
certain
lines
seemed
to
go
bumping
along
and
one
had
to
mispronounce
some
of
the
final
words
to
make
them
rhyme
with
others
gone
before
but
it
was
all
right
val
wrote
it
i
think
i
do
better
at
stories
she
ventured
modestly
i
wrote
one
a
little
story
about
university
life
and
sent
it
to
a
magazine
they
wrote
a
lovely
letter
about
it
but
it
seems
that
field
is
overdone
or
something
the
editor
asked
me
why
living
out
here
in
the
very
heart
of
the
west
i
do
try
western
stories
i
think
i
shall
and
that
why
i
said
i
should
need
your
help
i
thought
we
might
work
together
you
know
you
lived
here
so
long
and
ought
to
have
some
splendid
ideas
things
that
have
happened
or
that
you
heard
and
you
could
tell
me
and
i
write
them
up
would
you
like
to
collaborate
in
cahoots
on
it
kent
regarded
her
thoughtfully
she
really
was
looking
brighter
and
happier
and
her
enthusiasm
was
not
to
be
mistaken
her
world
had
changed
anything
i
can
do
to
help
you
know
of
course
i
know
i
think
it
perfectly
splendid
do
you
we
divide
the
money
when
there
any
and
will
we
his
tone
was
noncommittal
in
the
extreme
of
course
now
do
let
quarrel
about
that
till
we
come
to
it
i
have
a
good
idea
of
my
own
i
think
for
the
first
story
a
man
comes
out
here
and
disappears
you
know
and
after
a
while
his
sister
comes
to
find
him
she
gets
into
all
kinds
of
trouble
is
kidnapped
by
a
gang
of
robbers
and
kept
in
a
cave
when
the
leader
of
the
gang
comes
back
he
has
been
away
on
some
depredation
you
see
i
have
only
the
bare
outline
of
the
story
yet
and
well
it
her
brother
he
kills
the
one
who
kidnapped
her
and
she
reforms
him
of
course
there
ought
to
be
some
love
interest
i
think
perhaps
one
member
of
the
gang
ought
to
fall
in
love
with
her
do
you
know
and
after
a
while
he
wins
her
she
reform
him
too
i
oh
yes
she
could
love
a
man
she
could
respect
no
woman
oh
kent
took
a
minute
to
apply
that
personally
it
was
of
value
to
him
because
it
was
an
indication
of
val
own
code
maybe
he
suggested
tentatively
she
get
busy
and
reform
the
whole
oh
say
that
would
be
great
she
an
awfully
sweet
little
thing
perfectly
lovely
you
know
and
they
all
be
in
love
with
her
so
it
would
be
improbable
do
you
remember
kent
you
told
me
once
that
a
man
would
do
for
a
woman
if
he
cared
enough
for
her
sure
he
would
kent
fought
back
a
momentary
temptation
to
prove
the
truth
of
it
by
his
own
acquiescence
in
this
pal
business
he
was
saved
from
disaster
by
a
suspicion
that
val
would
not
be
able
to
see
it
from
his
point
of
view
and
by
the
fact
that
he
would
much
rather
be
pals
than
nothing
she
would
have
gone
on
talking
and
planning
and
discussing
indefinitely
but
the
sun
slid
lower
and
lower
and
kent
was
not
his
own
master
the
time
came
when
he
had
to
go
regardless
of
his
own
wishes
or
hers
when
he
came
again
the
story
was
finished
and
val
was
waiting
with
extreme
impatience
to
read
it
to
him
and
hear
his
opinion
before
she
sent
it
away
kent
was
not
so
impatient
to
hear
it
but
he
did
not
tell
her
so
he
had
not
seen
her
for
a
month
and
he
wanted
to
talk
not
about
anything
in
particular
just
talk
about
little
things
and
see
her
eyes
light
up
once
in
a
while
and
her
lips
purse
primly
when
he
said
something
daring
and
maybe
have
her
play
something
on
the
violin
while
he
smoked
and
watched
her
slim
wrist
bend
and
rise
and
fall
with
the
movement
of
the
bow
he
could
imagine
no
single
thing
more
fascinating
than
that
that
and
the
way
she
cuddled
the
violin
under
her
chin
in
the
hollow
of
her
neck
but
val
would
not
play
she
had
been
too
busy
to
practice
all
spring
and
summer
she
scarcely
ever
touched
the
violin
she
said
and
she
did
not
want
to
talk
or
if
she
did
it
was
plain
that
she
had
only
one
theme
so
kent
perforce
listened
to
the
story
afterward
he
assured
her
that
it
was
outa
as
a
matter
of
fact
half
the
time
he
had
not
heard
a
word
of
what
she
was
reading
he
had
been
too
busy
just
looking
at
her
and
being
glad
he
was
there
he
had
however
a
dim
impression
that
it
was
a
story
with
people
in
it
whom
one
does
not
try
to
imagine
as
ever
being
alive
and
with
a
west
which
beyond
its
evident
scarcity
of
inhabitants
was
not
the
west
he
knew
anything
about
one
paragraph
of
description
had
caught
his
attention
because
it
seemed
a
fairly
accurate
picture
of
the
bench
land
which
surrounded
cold
spring
coulee
but
it
had
not
seemed
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
story
itself
of
course
it
must
be
good
val
wrote
it
he
began
to
admire
her
intensely
quite
apart
from
his
own
personal
subjugation
val
was
pleased
with
his
praise
for
two
solid
hours
she
talked
of
nothing
but
that
story
and
she
gave
him
some
fresh
chocolate
cake
and
a
pitcher
of
lemonade
and
urged
him
to
come
again
in
about
three
weeks
when
she
expected
to
hear
from
the
magazine
she
thought
would
be
glad
to
take
the
story
the
one
whose
editor
had
suggested
that
she
write
of
the
west
in
the
fall
and
in
the
winter
their
discussions
were
frequently
hampered
by
manley
presence
but
val
enthusiasm
though
nipped
here
and
there
by
unappreciative
editors
managed
somehow
to
live
or
perhaps
it
had
developed
into
a
dogged
determination
to
succeed
in
spite
of
everything
she
still
wrote
things
and
she
still
read
them
to
kent
when
there
was
time
and
opportunity
sometimes
he
was
bold
enough
to
criticize
the
worst
places
and
to
tell
her
how
she
might
in
his
opinion
remedy
them
occasionally
val
would
take
his
advice
so
the
months
passed
the
winds
blew
and
brought
storm
and
heat
and
sunshine
and
cloud
nothing
in
that
big
land
appreciably
changed
except
the
people
and
they
so
imperceptibly
that
they
failed
to
realize
it
until
afterward
chapter
xviii
val
discovery
with
a
sun
at
his
back
and
a
rosy
tinge
upon
all
the
hills
before
him
manley
rode
slowly
down
the
western
rim
of
cold
spring
coulee
driving
five
rebellious
calves
that
had
escaped
the
branding
iron
in
the
spring
though
they
were
not
easily
driven
in
any
given
direction
he
was
singularly
patient
with
them
and
refrained
from
bellowing
epithets
and
admonitions
as
might
have
been
expected
when
he
was
almost
down
the
hill
he
saw
val
standing
in
the
kitchen
door
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hands
that
she
might
watch
his
approach
open
the
corral
gate
he
shouted
to
her
in
the
tone
of
command
and
stand
back
where
you
can
head
off
if
they
start
up
the
coulee
val
replied
by
doing
as
she
was
told
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
wasting
words
upon
manley
they
seemed
always
to
precipitate
an
unpleasant
discussion
of
some
sort
as
if
he
took
it
for
granted
she
disapproved
of
all
he
did
or
said
and
was
always
upon
the
defensive
the
calves
came
on
lumbering
awkwardly
in
a
gallop
as
if
they
had
very
little
energy
left
their
tongues
protruded
their
mouths
dribbled
a
lathery
foam
and
their
rough
sweaty
hides
told
val
of
the
long
chase
for
she
was
wiser
in
the
ways
of
the
range
land
than
she
had
been
she
stood
back
gently
waving
her
ruffled
white
apron
at
them
and
when
they
dodged
into
the
corral
rolling
eyes
at
her
she
ran
up
and
slammed
the
gate
shut
upon
them
looped
the
chain
around
the
post
and
dropped
the
iron
hook
into
a
link
to
fasten
it
manley
galloped
up
threw
himself
off
his
panting
horse
and
began
to
unsaddle
get
some
wood
and
start
a
fire
and
put
the
iron
in
val
he
told
her
brusquely
val
looked
at
him
quickly
now
supper
all
ready
manley
there
no
hurry
about
branding
them
is
there
and
she
added
dear
me
the
must
have
just
skimmed
the
top
off
this
range
last
spring
you
had
to
brand
a
lot
of
calves
that
were
what
the
devil
is
it
to
you
he
demanded
roughly
i
want
that
fire
madam
and
i
want
it
i
rather
think
i
knew
when
i
want
to
brand
without
asking
your
val
curved
her
lips
scornfully
shrugged
and
obeyed
she
was
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
and
she
did
not
mind
very
much
he
had
brutalized
by
degrees
and
by
degrees
she
had
hardened
he
could
rouse
no
feeling
now
but
contempt
if
you
kindly
wait
until
i
put
back
the
supper
she
said
coldly
i
suppose
in
your
zeal
one
need
not
sacrifice
your
food
you
still
rather
particular
about
that
i
manley
was
leading
his
horse
to
the
stable
and
though
he
answered
something
the
words
were
no
more
than
a
surly
mumble
he
been
drinking
again
val
decided
dispassionately
on
the
way
to
the
house
i
suppose
he
carried
a
bottle
in
his
pocket
and
emptied
she
was
not
long
there
was
a
penalty
of
profane
reproach
attached
to
delay
however
slight
when
manley
was
in
that
mood
she
had
the
fire
going
and
the
vp
iron
heating
by
the
time
he
had
stabled
and
fed
his
horse
and
had
driven
the
calves
into
the
smaller
pen
he
drove
a
big
heifer
into
a
corner
roped
and
tied
her
down
with
surprising
dexterity
and
turned
impatiently
come
is
that
iron
ready
yet
val
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
drew
it
out
and
inspected
it
indifferently
it
is
not
fleetwood
if
you
are
in
a
very
great
hurry
why
not
apply
your
temper
to
it
and
a
few
choice
remarks
oh
do
try
to
be
sarcastic
it
too
pathetic
kick
a
little
life
into
that
yes
sir
thank
you
val
could
be
rather
exasperating
when
she
chose
she
always
could
be
sure
of
making
manley
silently
furious
when
she
adopted
that
tone
of
respectful
servility
as
employed
by
butlers
and
footmen
upon
the
stage
her
mimicry
be
it
said
was
very
good
it
is
sir
thank
you
sir
i
kept
you
wyting
sir
she
announced
after
he
had
fumed
for
two
minutes
inside
the
corral
and
she
had
cynically
hummed
her
way
quite
through
the
hymn
which
begins
blest
be
the
tie
that
she
passed
the
iron
deftly
through
the
rails
to
him
and
fixed
the
fire
for
another
heating
really
she
was
not
thinking
of
manley
at
all
nor
of
his
mood
nor
of
his
brutal
coarseness
she
was
thinking
of
the
rebuilt
typewriter
advertised
as
being
exactly
as
good
as
a
new
one
and
scandalously
cheap
for
which
she
had
sold
her
watch
to
arline
hawley
to
get
money
to
buy
she
was
counting
mentally
the
days
since
she
had
sent
the
money
order
and
was
thinking
it
should
come
that
week
surely
she
was
also
planning
to
seize
upon
the
opportunity
afforded
by
next
absence
for
a
day
from
the
ranch
and
drive
to
hope
on
the
chance
of
getting
the
machine
only
she
wished
she
could
be
sure
whether
kent
would
be
coming
soon
she
did
not
want
to
miss
seeing
him
she
decided
to
sound
polycarp
jenks
the
next
time
he
came
polycarp
would
know
of
course
whether
the
wishbone
outfit
was
in
from
polycarp
always
knew
everything
that
had
been
done
or
was
intended
among
the
neighbors
manley
passed
the
iron
back
to
her
and
she
put
it
in
the
fire
quite
mechanically
it
was
not
the
first
time
nor
the
second
that
she
had
been
called
upon
to
help
brand
she
could
heat
an
iron
as
quickly
and
evenly
as
most
men
though
manley
had
never
troubled
to
tell
her
so
five
times
she
heated
the
iron
and
heard
with
an
inward
quiver
of
pity
and
disgust
the
spasmodic
blat
of
the
calf
in
the
pen
when
the
vp
went
searing
into
the
hide
on
its
ribs
she
did
not
see
why
they
must
be
branded
that
evening
in
particular
but
it
was
as
well
to
have
it
done
with
also
if
manley
meant
to
wean
them
she
would
have
to
see
that
they
were
fed
and
watered
she
supposed
that
would
make
her
trip
to
town
a
hurried
one
if
she
went
at
all
she
would
have
to
go
and
come
the
same
day
and
arline
hawley
would
scold
and
beg
her
to
stay
and
call
her
a
fool
now
how
about
that
supper
asked
manley
when
they
were
through
and
the
air
was
clearing
a
little
from
the
smoke
and
the
smell
of
burned
hair
i
really
do
know
i
smelled
the
potatoes
burning
some
time
ago
see
she
brushed
her
hands
with
her
handkerchief
pushed
back
the
lock
of
hair
that
was
always
falling
across
her
temple
and
because
she
was
really
offended
by
manley
attitude
and
tone
she
sang
softly
all
the
way
to
the
house
merely
to
conceal
from
him
the
fact
that
he
could
move
her
even
to
irritation
her
best
weapon
she
had
discovered
long
ago
was
absolute
indifference
the
indifference
which
overlooked
his
presence
and
was
deaf
to
his
recriminations
she
completed
her
preparations
for
his
supper
made
sure
that
nothing
was
lacking
and
that
the
tea
was
just
right
placed
his
chair
in
position
filled
the
water
glass
beside
his
plate
set
the
where
he
could
reach
it
handily
and
went
into
the
living
room
and
closed
the
door
between
in
the
past
year
filed
as
it
had
been
with
her
literary
ambitions
and
endeavors
she
had
neglected
her
music
but
she
took
her
violin
from
the
box
hunted
the
cake
of
resin
tuned
the
strings
and
when
she
heard
him
come
into
the
kitchen
and
sit
down
at
the
table
seated
herself
upon
the
front
doorstep
and
began
to
play
there
was
one
bit
of
music
which
manley
thoroughly
detested
that
was
the
therefore
she
played
the
traumerei
slowly
as
it
should
of
course
be
played
with
full
value
given
to
all
the
pensive
notes
and
with
a
finale
positively
creepy
in
its
dreamy
wistfulness
val
as
has
been
stated
could
be
very
exasperating
when
she
chose
in
the
kitchen
there
was
the
subdued
rattle
of
dishes
unbroken
and
unhurried
val
went
on
playing
but
she
forgot
that
she
had
begun
in
a
desire
to
annoy
her
husband
she
stared
dreamily
at
the
hill
which
shut
out
the
world
to
the
east
and
yielded
to
a
mood
of
loneliness
of
longing
in
the
abstract
for
all
the
pleasant
things
she
was
missing
in
this
life
which
she
had
chosen
in
her
ignorance
when
manley
flung
open
the
inner
door
she
gave
a
stifled
exclamation
she
had
forgotten
all
about
manley
by
all
the
big
and
little
gods
of
greece
he
swore
angrily
calves
bawling
their
heads
off
in
the
corral
and
you
squalling
that
whiny
stuff
you
call
music
in
the
house
home
sure
a
hell
of
a
happy
place
i
going
to
town
you
do
want
to
leave
the
place
till
i
come
back
i
want
those
calves
looked
he
seemed
to
consider
something
mentally
and
then
added
if
i
not
back
before
they
quit
bawling
you
can
turn
down
in
the
river
field
with
the
rest
you
know
when
they
weaned
and
ready
to
settle
down
do
feed
too
much
hay
like
you
did
that
other
bunch
just
give
what
they
need
you
do
have
to
pile
the
corral
full
and
do
keep
shut
up
an
hour
longer
than
val
nodded
her
head
to
show
that
she
heard
and
went
on
playing
there
was
seldom
any
pretense
of
good
feeling
between
them
now
she
tuned
the
violin
to
minor
and
poised
the
bow
over
the
strings
in
some
doubt
as
to
her
memory
of
a
serenade
she
wanted
to
try
next
shall
i
have
polycarp
take
the
team
and
haul
up
some
wood
from
the
river
she
asked
carelessly
we
nearly
out
oh
do
care
if
he
happens
he
turned
and
went
out
his
mind
turning
eagerly
to
the
town
and
what
it
could
give
him
in
the
way
of
pleasure
val
still
sitting
in
the
doorway
saw
him
ride
away
up
the
grade
and
disappear
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
dusk
was
settling
softly
upon
the
land
so
that
his
figure
was
but
a
vague
shape
she
was
alone
again
she
rather
liked
being
alone
now
that
she
had
no
longer
a
blind
unreasoning
terror
of
the
empty
land
she
had
her
thoughts
and
her
work
the
presence
of
manley
was
merely
an
unpleasant
interruption
to
both
some
time
in
the
night
she
heard
the
lowing
of
a
cow
somewhere
near
she
wondered
dreamily
what
it
could
be
doing
in
the
coulee
and
went
to
sleep
again
the
five
calves
were
all
bawling
in
a
chorus
of
complaint
against
their
forced
separation
from
their
mothers
and
the
deeper
throaty
tones
of
the
cow
mingled
not
inharmoniously
with
the
sound
range
cattle
were
not
permitted
in
the
coulee
and
when
by
chance
they
found
a
broken
panel
in
the
fence
and
strayed
down
there
val
drove
them
out
afoot
usually
with
shouts
and
badly
aimed
stones
to
accelerate
their
lumbering
pace
after
she
had
eaten
her
breakfast
in
the
morning
she
went
out
to
investigate
beyond
the
corral
her
nose
thrust
close
against
the
rails
a
cow
was
bawling
dismally
inside
in
much
the
same
position
its
tail
waving
a
violent
signal
of
its
owner
distress
a
calf
was
clamoring
hysterically
for
its
mother
and
its
mother
milk
val
sympathized
with
them
both
but
the
cow
did
not
belong
in
the
coulee
and
she
gathered
two
or
three
small
stones
and
went
around
where
she
could
frighten
her
away
from
the
fence
without
however
exposing
herself
too
recklessly
to
her
uncertain
temper
cows
at
weaning
time
did
sometimes
object
to
being
driven
from
their
calves
shoo
go
on
away
from
there
val
raised
a
stone
and
poised
it
threateningly
the
cow
turned
and
regarded
her
it
backed
a
step
or
two
evidently
uncertain
of
its
next
move
go
on
away
val
was
just
on
the
point
of
throwing
the
rock
when
she
dropped
it
unheeded
to
the
ground
and
stared
why
you
you
why
the
she
turned
slowly
white
certain
things
must
filter
to
the
understanding
through
amazement
and
disbelief
it
took
val
a
minute
or
two
to
grasp
the
significance
of
what
she
saw
by
the
time
she
did
grasp
it
her
knees
were
beading
weakly
beneath
the
weight
of
her
body
she
put
out
a
groping
hand
and
caught
at
the
corner
of
the
corral
to
keep
herself
from
falling
and
she
stared
and
stared
it
oh
surely
not
she
whispered
protesting
against
her
understanding
she
gave
a
little
sob
that
had
no
immediate
relation
to
tears
surely
not
it
was
of
no
use
understanding
came
and
came
clearly
pitilessly
many
things
trifles
all
of
them
to
which
she
had
given
no
thought
at
the
time
or
which
she
had
forgotten
immediately
came
back
to
her
of
their
own
accord
things
she
tried
to
remember
the
cow
stared
at
her
for
a
minute
and
when
she
made
no
hostile
move
turned
its
attention
back
to
its
bereavement
once
again
it
thrust
its
moist
muzzle
between
two
rails
gave
a
preliminary
vibrant
mmmmm
and
then
with
a
spasmodic
heaving
of
ribs
and
of
flank
burst
into
a
aw
aw
which
rose
rapidly
in
a
tremulous
crescendo
and
died
to
a
throaty
rumbling
val
started
nervously
though
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
cow
and
she
knew
the
sound
was
coming
it
served
however
to
release
her
from
the
spell
of
horror
which
had
gripped
her
she
was
still
white
and
when
she
moved
she
felt
intolerably
heavy
so
that
her
feet
dragged
but
she
was
no
longer
dazed
she
went
slowly
around
to
the
gate
reached
up
wearily
and
undid
the
chain
fastening
opened
the
gate
slightly
and
went
in
four
of
the
calves
were
huddled
together
for
mutual
comfort
in
a
corner
they
were
blatting
indefatigably
val
went
over
to
where
the
fifth
one
still
stood
beside
the
fence
as
near
the
cow
as
it
could
get
and
threw
a
small
stone
that
bounced
off
the
calf
rump
the
calf
jumped
and
ran
aimlessly
before
her
until
it
reached
the
gate
when
it
dodged
out
as
if
it
could
scarcely
believe
its
own
good
fortune
before
val
could
follow
it
outside
it
was
nuzzling
rapturously
its
mother
and
the
cow
was
contorting
her
body
so
that
she
could
caress
her
offspring
with
her
tongue
while
she
rumbled
her
satisfaction
val
closed
and
fastened
the
gate
carefully
and
went
back
to
where
the
cow
still
lingered
with
her
lips
drawn
to
a
thin
colorless
line
she
drove
her
across
the
coulee
and
up
the
hill
the
calf
gamboling
close
alongside
when
they
had
gone
out
of
sight
up
on
the
level
val
turned
back
and
went
slowly
to
the
house
she
stood
for
a
minute
staring
stupidly
at
it
and
at
the
coulee
went
in
and
gazed
around
her
with
that
blankness
which
follows
a
great
mental
shock
after
a
minute
she
shivered
threw
up
her
hands
before
her
face
and
dropped
a
pitiful
sorrowing
heap
of
quivering
rebellion
upon
the
couch
chapter
xix
kent
confession
polycarp
jenks
came
ambling
into
the
coulee
rapped
perfunctorily
upon
the
and
entered
the
kitchen
as
one
who
feels
perfectly
at
home
and
sure
of
his
welcome
as
was
not
unfitting
considering
the
fact
that
he
had
chored
around
for
val
during
the
last
year
and
longer
anybody
to
home
he
called
seeing
the
front
door
shut
tight
there
was
a
stir
within
and
val
still
pale
and
with
an
almost
furtive
expression
in
her
eyes
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
oh
it
you
polycarp
she
said
lifelessly
is
there
anything
what
the
matter
sick
you
look
kinda
peaked
and
frazzled
out
i
met
man
las
night
and
he
told
me
you
needed
wood
i
thought
i
ride
over
and
see
by
granny
you
do
look
just
a
headache
val
evaded
shrinking
back
guiltily
just
do
whatever
there
is
to
do
polycarp
i
think
i
do
believe
the
chickens
have
had
anything
to
eat
them
headaches
are
sure
a
fright
they
might
nigh
as
bad
as
rheumatiz
when
they
hit
you
hard
you
jest
go
back
and
lay
down
and
i
look
around
and
see
what
they
is
to
do
any
idee
when
man
comin
back
val
brought
the
word
out
with
an
involuntary
sharpness
no
i
reckon
not
i
hear
him
and
fred
de
garmo
come
might
near
havin
a
fight
las
night
blumenthall
was
tellin
me
this
mornin
fred
quit
the
double
diamond
i
hear
he
got
himself
appointed
stock
inspector
and
how
he
managed
to
git
the
job
is
more
i
can
figure
out
they
say
he
all
swelled
up
over
it
got
his
headquarters
in
town
you
know
and
seems
he
got
to
lordin
it
over
man
las
night
and
i
guess
if
somebody
had
stopped
they
of
been
a
all
right
man
in
no
shape
to
fight
he
been
drinkin
pretty
yes
well
just
do
whatever
there
is
to
do
polycarp
the
horses
are
in
the
upper
pasture
i
think
if
you
want
to
haul
she
closed
the
door
gently
but
with
exceeding
firmness
and
polycarp
took
the
hint
women
is
queer
he
muttered
as
he
left
the
house
now
she
knows
man
drinks
like
a
fish
and
she
knows
everybody
else
knows
it
but
if
you
so
much
as
mention
sech
a
thing
why
he
waggled
his
head
disapprovingly
and
proceeded
in
his
habitually
laborious
manner
to
take
a
chew
of
tobacco
no
matter
how
much
they
may
know
a
thing
is
so
if
it
do
suit
you
ca
never
git
to
stand
right
up
and
face
it
out
seems
like
by
granny
it
comes
natural
to
to
make
believe
things
is
different
now
she
knows
might
well
she
ca
fool
i
hearn
man
swear
at
her
like
he
reached
the
corral
and
his
insatiable
curiosity
turned
his
thoughts
into
a
different
channel
he
inspected
the
four
calves
gravely
wondered
audibly
where
man
had
found
them
and
how
the
came
to
miss
them
and
criticized
his
application
of
the
brand
in
the
opinion
of
polycarp
manley
either
burned
too
deep
or
not
deep
enough
time
that
heifer
scabs
off
you
ca
tell
what
on
her
he
asserted
expectorating
solemnly
before
he
turned
away
to
his
work
prom
a
window
val
watched
him
with
cold
terror
would
he
suspect
or
was
there
anything
to
suspect
it
silly
it
perfectly
idiotic
she
told
herself
impatiently
but
if
he
hangs
around
that
corral
another
minute
i
shall
scream
she
watched
until
she
saw
him
mount
his
horse
and
ride
off
toward
the
upper
pasture
then
she
went
out
and
began
apathetically
picking
seed
pods
off
her
which
the
early
frosts
had
spared
head
better
called
polycarp
half
an
hour
later
when
he
went
rattling
past
the
house
with
the
wagon
bound
for
the
river
bottom
where
they
got
their
supply
of
wood
a
little
val
answered
inattentively
without
looking
at
him
it
was
while
polycarp
was
after
the
wood
and
while
she
was
sitting
upon
the
edge
of
the
porch
listlessly
arranging
and
rearranging
a
handful
of
blossoms
that
kent
galloped
down
the
hill
and
up
to
the
gate
she
saw
him
coming
and
set
her
teeth
hard
together
she
did
not
want
to
see
kent
just
then
she
did
not
want
to
see
anybody
kent
however
wanted
to
see
her
it
seemed
to
him
at
least
a
month
since
he
had
had
a
glimpse
of
her
though
it
was
no
more
than
half
that
time
he
watched
her
covertly
while
he
came
up
the
path
his
mind
all
the
way
over
from
the
wishbone
had
been
very
clear
and
very
decided
he
had
a
certain
thing
to
tell
her
and
a
certain
thing
to
do
he
had
thought
it
all
out
during
the
nights
when
he
could
not
sleep
and
the
days
when
men
called
him
surly
and
there
was
no
going
back
no
reconsideration
of
the
matter
he
had
been
telling
himself
that
over
and
over
ever
since
the
house
came
into
view
and
he
saw
her
sitting
there
on
the
porch
she
would
probably
want
to
argue
and
perhaps
she
would
try
to
persuade
him
but
it
would
be
absolutely
useless
absolutely
well
hello
he
cried
with
more
than
his
usual
buoyancy
of
manner
because
he
knew
he
must
hurt
her
later
on
hello
madam
authoress
why
this
haughty
air
this
stuckupiness
shall
i
get
a
ladder
and
climb
up
where
you
can
hear
me
say
howdy
he
took
off
his
hat
and
slapped
her
gently
upon
the
top
of
her
head
with
it
come
out
of
the
fog
oh
i
wish
you
would
she
glanced
up
at
him
so
briefly
that
he
caught
only
a
flicker
of
her
eyes
and
went
on
fumbling
her
flowers
kent
stood
and
looked
down
at
her
for
a
moment
mad
he
inquired
cheerfully
say
you
look
awfully
savage
on
the
dead
you
do
what
do
care
if
they
sent
it
back
you
had
all
the
fun
of
writing
it
and
you
know
it
a
dandy
please
smile
please
he
wheedled
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
discovered
her
in
a
despondent
mood
nor
the
first
time
he
had
bantered
and
badgered
her
out
of
her
gloom
presently
it
dawned
upon
him
that
this
was
more
serious
he
had
never
seen
her
quite
so
colorless
or
so
completely
without
spirit
sick
pal
he
asked
gently
sitting
down
beside
her
i
suppose
val
bit
her
lips
as
soon
as
she
had
spoken
to
check
their
quivering
well
what
is
it
i
wish
you
tell
me
i
came
over
here
full
of
something
i
had
to
tell
you
but
i
ca
now
not
while
you
like
he
watched
her
yearningly
oh
i
ca
tell
you
it
val
jerked
a
viciously
from
its
stem
pressed
her
hand
against
her
mouth
and
turned
reluctantly
toward
him
what
was
it
you
came
to
tell
me
he
watched
her
narrowly
i
gamble
you
down
in
the
mouth
about
something
hubby
has
said
or
done
you
need
tell
me
but
i
just
want
to
ask
you
if
you
think
it
worth
while
you
need
tell
me
that
either
you
know
blamed
well
it
ai
he
ca
deal
you
any
more
misery
than
you
let
him
hand
out
you
want
to
keep
that
in
another
blossom
was
demolished
what
was
it
you
came
to
tell
me
she
repeated
steadily
though
she
did
not
look
at
him
oh
nothing
much
i
going
to
leave
the
country
is
kent
after
a
minute
she
forced
another
word
out
why
kent
regarded
her
somberly
you
better
think
twice
before
you
ask
me
that
he
warned
because
i
ai
much
good
at
beating
all
around
the
bush
if
you
ask
me
again
i
tell
you
and
i
liable
to
tell
you
without
any
he
drew
a
hard
breath
so
i
advise
you
not
to
ask
he
finished
half
challengingly
val
placed
a
pale
lavender
blossom
against
a
creamy
white
one
and
held
the
two
up
for
inspection
when
are
you
going
she
asked
evenly
i
do
know
exactly
in
a
day
or
so
saturday
she
hesitated
over
the
flowers
in
her
lap
and
selected
a
pink
one
which
she
tried
with
the
white
and
the
lavender
and
are
you
going
she
asked
him
deliberately
kent
stared
at
her
fixedly
a
faint
pink
flush
was
creeping
into
her
cheeks
he
watched
it
deepen
and
knew
that
his
silence
was
filling
her
with
uneasiness
he
wondered
how
much
she
guessed
of
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
how
much
it
would
mean
to
her
all
right
i
tell
you
why
fast
his
tone
was
grim
i
going
to
leave
the
country
because
i
ca
stay
any
longer
not
while
you
in
why
kent
she
seemed
inexpressibly
shocked
i
do
know
he
went
on
relentlessly
what
you
think
a
man
made
of
anyhow
and
i
do
know
what
think
of
this
pal
business
i
know
what
i
think
it
a
mighty
good
way
to
drive
a
man
crazy
i
had
about
all
of
it
i
can
stand
if
you
want
to
i
sorry
if
you
do
if
you
ca
be
friends
any
longer
she
said
and
he
winced
to
see
how
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
of
course
if
you
ca
if
it
bores
you
kent
seized
her
arm
a
bit
roughly
have
i
got
to
come
right
out
and
tell
you
in
plain
english
that
i
that
it
because
i
so
deep
in
love
with
you
i
ca
if
you
only
knew
what
it
cost
me
this
last
year
to
play
the
game
and
not
play
it
too
hard
what
do
you
think
a
man
made
of
do
you
think
a
man
can
care
for
a
woman
like
i
care
for
you
and
do
you
think
he
wants
to
be
just
pals
and
stand
back
and
watch
some
drunken
brute
abuse
her
and
never
here
his
voice
grew
testier
do
do
that
do
i
did
want
to
hurt
you
god
knows
i
did
want
to
hurt
you
he
threw
his
seem
around
her
shoulders
and
pulled
her
toward
him
do
pal
i
a
brute
i
guess
like
all
the
rest
of
the
male
humans
i
do
mean
to
be
it
the
way
i
made
when
a
woman
means
so
much
to
me
that
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
day
or
night
and
get
to
counting
days
and
scheming
to
see
her
why
being
friends
like
we
been
is
like
giving
a
man
a
teaspoon
of
milk
and
water
when
he
starving
to
death
and
thinking
that
oughta
do
but
i
should
have
let
it
hurt
you
i
tried
to
stand
for
it
little
woman
these
were
times
when
i
just
had
to
fight
myself
not
to
take
you
up
in
my
arms
and
carry
you
of
and
keep
you
you
must
admit
he
argued
smiling
rather
wanly
that
considering
how
felt
about
it
i
done
pretty
tolerable
well
up
till
now
you
do
you
never
will
know
how
much
it
cost
why
my
nerves
are
getting
so
raw
i
ca
stand
anything
any
more
that
why
i
going
i
do
want
to
hang
around
till
i
do
something
he
took
his
arm
away
from
her
shoulders
and
moved
farther
off
he
was
not
sure
how
far
he
might
trust
himself
if
i
thought
you
cared
or
if
there
was
anything
i
could
do
for
you
he
ventured
after
a
moment
why
it
would
be
different
but
val
lifted
her
head
and
turned
to
him
there
is
something
or
there
was
or
oh
i
ca
think
any
more
i
suppose
doubtfully
if
you
feel
as
you
say
you
do
why
it
would
be
wicked
to
stay
but
you
do
you
must
just
imagine
oh
all
right
kent
interpolated
ironically
but
if
you
go
away
she
got
up
and
stood
before
him
breathing
unevenly
in
little
gasps
oh
you
must
go
away
please
do
go
i
something
terrible
happened
oh
kent
i
need
you
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
is
it
the
most
horrible
thing
i
ever
heard
of
you
ca
imagine
anything
more
horrible
kent
she
twisted
her
fingers
together
nervously
and
the
blossoms
dropped
one
by
one
on
the
ground
if
you
go
she
pleaded
i
wo
have
a
friend
in
the
country
not
a
real
friend
and
and
i
never
needed
a
friend
as
much
as
i
do
now
and
you
must
go
i
i
ca
let
you
go
it
was
like
her
hysterical
fear
of
being
left
alone
after
the
fire
kent
eyed
her
keenly
he
knew
there
must
have
been
something
to
put
her
into
this
state
something
more
than
his
own
rebellion
he
felt
suddenly
ashamed
of
his
weakness
in
giving
way
in
telling
her
how
it
was
with
him
the
faint
chuckle
of
a
wagon
came
to
his
ears
he
turned
impatiently
toward
the
sound
polycarp
was
driving
up
the
coulee
with
a
load
of
wood
already
he
was
nearing
the
gate
which
opened
into
the
lower
field
kent
stood
up
reached
out
and
caught
val
by
the
hand
come
on
into
the
house
he
said
peremptorily
polly
coming
and
you
do
want
him
goggling
and
listening
and
i
want
you
he
added
when
he
had
led
her
inside
and
closed
the
door
to
tell
me
what
all
this
is
about
there
something
and
i
want
to
know
what
if
it
concerns
you
then
it
concerns
me
a
whole
lot
too
and
what
concerns
me
i
going
to
find
out
about
what
is
it
val
sat
down
got
up
immediately
and
crossed
the
room
aimlessly
to
sit
in
another
chair
she
pressed
her
palms
tightly
against
both
cheeks
drew
in
her
breath
as
if
she
were
going
to
speak
and
after
all
said
nothing
she
looked
out
of
the
window
pushing
back
the
errant
strand
of
hair
i
ca
i
do
know
how
to
tell
you
she
began
desperately
it
too
maybe
it
is
i
do
know
what
you
call
too
horrible
i
kinda
think
it
would
be
what
i
tack
those
words
to
anyway
what
is
it
he
went
close
and
he
spoke
insistently
she
took
a
long
breath
manley
a
thief
she
jerked
the
words
out
like
as
automaton
they
were
not
evidently
the
words
she
had
meant
to
speak
for
she
seemed
frightened
afterward
oh
that
it
kent
made
a
sound
which
was
not
far
from
a
snort
well
what
about
it
what
he
done
how
did
you
find
it
out
val
straightened
in
the
chair
and
gazed
up
at
him
once
more
her
tawny
eyes
gave
him
a
certain
shock
as
if
he
had
never
before
noticed
them
after
all
our
neighbors
have
done
for
him
she
cried
bitterly
after
giving
him
hay
when
his
was
burned
and
he
could
buy
any
after
building
stables
and
corral
and
everything
they
did
the
kindest
best
neighbors
a
man
ever
had
oh
it
too
shameful
for
utterance
i
might
forgive
it
i
might
only
for
that
the
the
ingratitude
it
too
despicable
too
kent
laid
a
steadying
hand
upon
her
arm
yes
but
what
is
it
he
interrupted
val
shook
off
his
hand
unconsciously
impatient
of
any
touch
oh
the
bare
deed
itself
well
it
rather
petty
too
and
her
voice
became
full
of
contempt
it
was
the
calves
he
brought
home
five
last
night
five
that
had
been
branded
last
spring
where
he
found
them
do
know
i
did
care
enough
about
it
to
ask
he
had
been
drinking
i
think
i
can
usually
tell
and
he
often
carries
a
bottle
in
his
pocket
as
i
happen
to
know
well
he
had
me
make
a
fire
and
heat
the
iron
for
him
and
he
branded
them
last
night
he
was
very
touchy
about
it
when
i
asked
him
what
was
his
hurry
i
think
now
it
was
a
stupid
thing
for
him
to
do
and
well
in
the
night
some
time
i
heard
a
cow
bawling
around
close
and
this
morning
i
went
out
to
drive
her
away
the
fence
is
always
down
somewhere
i
suppose
she
found
a
place
to
get
through
so
i
went
out
to
drive
her
her
eyes
dropped
as
if
she
were
making
a
confession
of
her
own
misdeed
she
clenched
her
hands
tightly
in
her
lap
well
it
was
a
wishbone
after
all
she
said
it
very
quietly
the
devil
it
was
kent
had
been
prepared
for
something
of
the
sort
but
nevertheless
he
started
when
he
heard
his
own
outfit
mentioned
yes
it
was
a
wishbone
her
voice
was
flat
and
monotonous
he
had
stolen
her
calf
he
had
it
in
the
corral
and
he
had
branded
it
with
his
own
brand
with
a
vp
my
initials
she
wailed
suddenly
as
if
the
thought
had
just
struck
her
and
was
intolerably
bitter
she
had
followed
had
been
hunting
her
calf
it
was
rather
a
little
calf
smaller
than
the
others
and
it
was
crowded
up
against
the
fence
trying
to
get
to
her
there
was
no
mistaking
their
relationship
i
tried
to
think
he
had
made
a
mistake
but
it
of
no
use
i
know
he
did
i
know
he
that
calf
and
for
all
i
know
the
others
too
oh
it
perfectly
horrible
to
think
of
kent
could
easily
guess
her
horror
of
it
and
he
was
sorry
for
her
but
his
mind
turned
instantly
to
the
practical
side
of
it
well
maybe
it
can
be
fixed
up
if
you
feel
so
bad
about
it
does
polycarp
did
he
see
the
cow
hanging
around
val
shook
her
head
apathetically
no
he
did
come
till
just
a
little
while
ago
that
was
this
morning
and
i
drove
her
out
of
the
coulee
her
and
her
calf
they
went
off
up
over
the
kent
stood
looking
down
at
her
rather
stupidly
you
what
was
it
you
did
it
seemed
to
him
that
something
some
vital
point
of
the
story
had
eluded
him
i
drove
them
away
i
did
think
they
ought
to
be
permitted
to
hang
around
her
lips
quivered
again
i
i
did
want
to
see
him
get
into
any
you
drove
them
away
both
of
them
kent
was
frowning
at
her
now
val
sprang
up
and
faced
him
all
with
indignation
certainly
both
not
a
thief
kent
burnett
when
i
knew
when
there
was
no
possible
doubt
why
what
in
heaven
name
i
do
it
manley
calf
i
turned
it
loose
to
go
back
where
it
with
a
vp
on
its
ribs
kent
was
staring
at
her
curiously
well
i
do
care
fifty
vp
could
make
the
calf
manley
if
anybody
came
and
saw
that
cow
why
val
looked
at
him
rafter
pityingly
as
if
she
could
not
quite
understand
how
he
could
even
question
her
upon
that
point
and
after
all
she
added
forlornly
he
my
husband
i
could
i
had
to
do
what
i
could
to
shield
him
just
for
sake
of
the
past
i
suppose
much
as
i
despise
him
i
ca
forget
that
that
i
cared
once
it
because
i
wanted
your
advice
that
i
it
a
pity
you
did
get
it
sooner
then
ca
you
see
what
done
why
think
a
minute
a
vp
calf
running
with
a
wishbone
cow
why
it
you
could
advertise
man
as
a
rustler
any
better
if
you
tried
the
first
fellow
that
runs
onto
that
cow
and
calf
well
he
wo
need
to
do
any
guessing
he
it
a
ticket
to
deer
lodge
that
vp
calf
now
do
you
see
he
turned
away
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
absently
at
the
brown
hillside
his
hands
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
and
there
fred
de
garmo
with
his
new
job
ranging
around
the
country
just
aching
to
cinch
somebody
and
show
his
authority
it
a
matter
of
days
almost
he
like
nothing
better
than
to
get
a
whack
at
man
even
if
the
wishbone
outside
they
could
hear
polycarp
throwing
the
wood
off
the
wagon
knowing
him
as
they
did
they
knew
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
found
an
excuse
for
coming
into
the
house
he
had
more
than
once
evinced
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
kent
visits
there
and
shown
an
unmistakable
desire
to
know
what
they
were
talking
about
they
had
never
paid
much
attention
to
him
but
now
even
val
felt
a
vague
uneasiness
lest
he
overhear
she
had
been
sitting
her
face
buried
in
her
arms
crushed
beneath
the
knowledge
of
what
she
had
done
do
worry
little
kent
went
over
and
passed
his
hand
lightly
over
her
hair
you
did
what
looked
to
you
to
be
the
right
thing
the
honest
thing
and
the
chances
are
he
get
caught
before
long
anyhow
i
do
reckon
this
is
the
first
time
he
done
but
to
think
to
think
that
should
do
it
when
i
wanted
to
save
him
he
kent
i
despise
him
he
has
killed
all
the
love
i
ever
felt
for
him
killed
it
over
and
over
but
if
anybody
finds
that
calf
and
and
if
they
kent
i
shall
go
crazy
if
i
have
to
feel
that
sent
him
to
prison
to
think
of
him
shut
up
there
and
to
know
that
i
did
it
i
ca
bear
it
she
caught
his
arm
she
pressed
her
forehead
against
it
kent
is
there
some
way
to
get
it
back
if
i
should
find
it
and
and
shoot
it
and
pay
the
wishbone
what
it
worth
oh
amount
or
shoot
the
cow
or
she
raised
her
face
imploringly
to
his
tell
me
pal
or
i
shall
go
stark
raving
mad
polycarp
came
into
the
kitchen
and
from
the
sound
he
was
trying
to
enter
as
unobtrusively
as
possible
even
to
the
extent
of
walking
on
his
toes
go
see
what
that
darned
old
sneak
wants
kent
commanded
in
an
undertone
act
as
if
nothing
happened
if
you
he
watched
anxiously
while
she
drew
a
long
breath
pressed
her
hands
hard
against
her
cheeks
closed
her
lips
tightly
and
then
with
something
like
composure
went
quietly
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
polycarp
was
standing
very
close
to
it
on
the
other
side
he
drew
back
a
step
i
wondered
if
i
better
git
another
load
now
i
got
the
team
hooked
up
he
began
in
his
rasping
nasal
voice
his
slitlike
eyes
peering
inquisitively
into
the
room
hello
kenneth
i
that
was
your
horse
standin
outside
or
would
you
rather
i
cut
up
a
pile
i
dunno
but
what
i
have
to
go
or
next
day
mebby
i
better
cut
you
some
wood
hey
if
man
ai
likely
to
be
home
mebby
i
think
polycarp
well
have
a
storm
soon
so
it
would
be
good
policy
to
haul
another
load
do
you
think
i
can
manage
very
well
with
what
there
is
cut
until
manley
returns
and
there
are
always
small
branches
that
i
can
break
easily
with
the
axe
i
really
think
it
would
be
safer
to
have
another
load
hauled
now
while
we
can
do
you
think
so
val
even
managed
to
smile
at
him
if
my
head
was
so
bad
she
added
deceitfully
i
should
be
tempted
to
go
along
just
for
a
dose
sight
of
the
river
burnett
is
going
directly
perhaps
i
may
walk
down
later
on
but
you
had
better
not
wait
i
should
want
to
keep
you
working
till
polycarp
eying
her
and
kent
and
the
room
in
all
its
details
forced
his
hand
into
his
trousers
pocket
brought
up
his
battered
plug
of
tobacco
and
pried
off
a
piece
which
he
rolled
into
his
left
cheek
with
his
tongue
jest
as
you
say
he
surrendered
though
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
he
would
much
prefer
to
cut
wood
and
so
be
able
to
see
all
that
went
on
even
though
he
was
denied
the
gratification
of
hearing
what
they
said
he
waited
a
moment
but
val
turned
away
and
even
had
the
audacity
to
close
the
door
upon
his
unfinished
reply
he
listened
for
a
moment
his
head
craned
forward
purty
kinda
he
mumbled
time
man
had
a
flea
put
in
ear
by
granny
if
he
do
want
to
lose
that
wife
of
to
polycarp
a
closed
door
when
a
man
and
woman
were
alone
upon
the
other
side
could
mean
nothing
but
surreptitious
kisses
and
the
like
he
went
stumbling
out
and
drove
away
down
the
coulee
his
head
turning
automatically
so
that
his
eyes
were
constantly
upon
the
house
from
his
attitude
as
kent
saw
him
through
the
window
polycarp
expected
an
explosion
at
the
very
least
his
outraged
virtue
vested
itself
in
one
more
sentence
purty
blamed
nervy
by
granny
to
go
shut
the
door
right
in
m
face
inside
the
room
val
stood
for
a
minute
with
her
back
against
the
door
as
if
she
half
feared
polycarp
would
break
in
and
drag
her
secret
from
her
when
she
heard
him
leave
the
kitchen
she
drew
a
long
breath
eloquent
in
itself
when
the
rattle
of
the
wagon
came
to
them
there
she
left
the
door
and
went
slowly
across
the
room
until
she
stood
close
to
kent
the
interruption
had
steadied
them
both
her
voice
was
a
constrained
calm
when
she
spoke
illustration
to
draw
the
red
hot
spur
across
the
fresh
vp
did
not
take
long
well
is
there
anything
i
can
do
because
i
suppose
every
minute
is
kent
kept
his
eyes
upon
the
departing
polycarp
there
nothing
you
can
do
no
maybe
i
can
do
something
soon
as
that
granny
gossip
is
outa
sight
i
go
and
round
up
that
cow
and
calf
if
somebody
has
beaten
me
to
val
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
timid
helplessness
oh
will
you
wo
it
be
against
the
law
if
you
if
you
kill
it
she
grew
slightly
excited
again
kent
you
shall
not
get
into
any
trouble
for
for
his
sake
if
it
comes
to
a
choice
why
let
him
suffer
for
his
crime
you
shall
not
kent
turned
his
head
slowly
and
gazed
down
at
her
do
run
away
with
the
idea
i
doing
it
for
him
he
told
her
distinctly
i
love
man
fleetwood
like
i
love
a
wolf
but
if
that
vp
calf
catches
him
up
you
fight
your
head
over
it
god
only
knows
how
long
i
know
you
you
think
so
much
about
the
part
you
played
that
you
wind
up
by
forgetting
everything
else
you
get
to
thinking
of
him
as
a
martyr
maybe
no
it
for
you
i
kinda
got
you
into
this
you
recollect
if
i
let
you
see
man
drank
that
day
you
never
have
married
him
i
know
that
now
so
i
going
to
get
you
out
of
it
my
side
of
the
question
can
she
stared
up
at
him
with
a
grave
understanding
but
you
know
what
i
said
you
wo
do
anything
that
can
make
you
trouble
wo
you
tell
me
kent
what
you
going
to
do
he
had
already
started
to
the
door
but
he
stopped
and
smiled
reassuringly
nothing
so
fierce
if
i
can
find
i
aim
to
bar
out
that
vp
sabe
chapter
xx
a
blotched
brand
at
the
brow
of
the
hill
which
was
the
western
rim
of
the
coulee
kent
turned
and
waved
a
farewell
to
val
watching
him
wistfully
from
the
kitchen
door
she
had
wanted
to
go
along
she
had
almost
cried
to
go
and
help
but
kent
would
not
permit
her
and
beneath
the
unpleasantness
of
denying
her
anything
there
had
been
a
certain
primitive
joy
in
feeling
himself
master
of
the
situation
and
of
her
actions
for
that
one
time
it
was
as
if
she
belonged
to
him
at
the
last
he
had
accepted
the
field
glasses
which
she
insisted
upon
lending
him
and
now
he
was
tempted
to
take
them
from
their
worn
leathern
case
and
focus
them
upon
her
face
just
for
the
meager
satisfaction
of
one
more
look
at
her
but
he
rode
on
oat
of
sight
for
the
necessity
which
drove
him
forth
did
not
permit
much
loitering
if
he
would
succeed
in
what
he
had
set
out
to
do
personally
he
would
have
felt
no
compunctions
whatever
about
letting
the
calf
go
a
walking
advertisement
of
manley
guilt
it
seemed
to
him
a
sort
of
grim
retribution
and
no
more
than
he
deserved
he
had
not
exaggerated
his
sentiments
when
he
intimated
plainly
to
her
his
hatred
of
manley
and
he
agreed
with
her
that
the
fellow
was
making
a
despicable
return
for
the
kindness
his
neighbors
had
always
shown
him
no
doubt
he
had
stolen
from
the
double
diamond
as
well
as
the
wishbone
once
kent
pulled
up
half
minded
to
go
back
and
let
events
shape
themselves
without
any
interference
from
him
but
there
was
val
women
were
so
queer
about
such
things
it
seemed
to
kent
that
if
any
man
had
caused
him
as
much
misery
as
manley
had
caused
val
he
would
not
waste
much
time
worrying
over
him
if
he
tangled
himself
up
with
his
own
misdeeds
however
val
wanted
that
bit
of
evidence
covered
up
so
while
kent
did
not
approve
he
went
at
the
business
with
his
customary
thoroughness
the
field
glasses
were
a
great
convenience
more
than
once
they
saved
him
the
trouble
of
riding
a
mile
or
so
to
inspect
a
small
bunch
of
stock
nevertheless
he
rode
for
several
hours
before
just
at
sundown
he
discovered
the
cow
feeding
alone
with
her
calf
in
a
shallow
depression
near
the
rough
country
next
the
river
they
were
wild
and
he
ran
them
out
of
the
hollow
and
up
on
high
ground
before
he
managed
to
drop
his
loop
over
the
calf
head
you
sure
are
a
all
right
he
observed
and
grinned
down
at
the
staring
vp
brand
it
a
pity
you
ca
be
left
that
he
glanced
cautiously
around
him
at
the
great
empty
prairie
a
mile
or
two
away
a
lone
horseman
was
loping
leisurely
along
evidently
bound
for
the
double
diamond
say
this
is
kinda
public
kent
complained
to
the
calf
let
you
and
me
go
down
outa
sight
for
a
he
started
off
toward
the
hollow
dragging
the
calf
a
protesting
bundle
of
stiffened
muscles
pulling
against
the
rope
the
cow
shaking
her
head
in
a
halfhearted
defiance
followed
kent
kept
an
uneasy
eye
upon
the
horseman
and
hoped
fervently
the
fellow
was
absorbed
in
meditation
and
would
not
glance
in
his
direction
once
he
was
almost
at
the
point
of
turning
the
calf
loose
for
barring
out
brands
even
illegal
brands
is
justly
looked
upon
with
disfavor
to
say
the
least
down
in
the
hollow
which
kent
reached
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
dismounted
and
hastily
started
a
little
fire
on
a
barren
patch
of
ground
beneath
a
jutting
sandstone
ledge
the
calf
tied
helpless
lay
near
by
and
the
cow
hovered
close
uneasy
but
lacking
courage
for
a
rush
kent
laid
hand
upon
his
saddle
hesitated
and
shook
his
head
he
might
need
it
in
a
hurry
and
cinch
ring
takes
time
both
in
the
removal
and
the
replacement
and
is
vitally
important
withal
his
knife
he
had
lost
on
the
last
he
scowled
at
the
necessity
lifted
his
heel
and
took
off
a
spur
and
if
that
darned
ginny
do
get
too
blamed
curious
and
cone
fogging
over
this
way
he
spoke
the
phrase
aloud
out
of
the
middle
of
a
mental
arrangement
of
the
chance
he
was
taking
to
heat
the
spur
draw
it
across
the
fresh
vp
again
and
again
and
finally
drag
it
crisscross
once
or
twice
to
make
assurance
an
absolute
certainty
did
not
take
long
kent
was
particular
about
not
wasting
any
seconds
the
calf
stopped
its
dismal
blatting
and
when
kent
released
it
and
coiled
his
rope
it
jumped
up
and
ran
for
its
life
the
cows
ambling
solicitously
at
its
heels
kent
kicked
the
dirt
over
the
fire
eyed
it
sharply
a
moment
to
make
sure
it
was
perfectly
harmless
mounted
in
haste
and
rode
up
the
sloping
side
down
which
he
had
come
just
under
the
top
of
the
slope
he
peeked
anxiously
out
over
the
prairie
ducked
precipitately
and
went
clattering
away
down
the
hollow
to
the
farther
side
dodged
around
a
spur
of
rocks
forced
his
horse
down
over
a
wicked
jumble
of
boulders
to
level
land
below
and
rode
as
if
a
hangman
noose
were
the
penalty
for
delay
when
he
reached
the
river
which
he
did
after
many
windings
and
turnings
he
got
off
and
washed
his
spur
scrubbing
it
diligently
with
sand
in
an
effort
to
remove
the
traces
of
fire
when
the
evidence
was
at
least
less
conspicuous
he
put
it
on
his
heel
and
jogged
down
the
river
bank
quite
innocently
inwardly
thankful
over
his
escape
he
had
certainly
done
nothing
wrong
but
one
sometimes
finds
it
rather
awkward
to
be
forced
into
an
explanation
of
a
perfectly
righteous
deed
if
i
been
stealing
that
calf
i
never
have
been
crazy
enough
to
take
such
a
long
chance
he
mused
and
laughed
a
little
i
bet
fred
thought
he
was
due
to
grab
a
rustler
right
in
the
act
only
he
was
a
little
bit
slow
about
making
up
his
mind
deputy
stock
inspectors
had
oughta
think
quicker
than
that
he
was
just
about
five
minutes
too
deliberate
gamble
he
scratching
his
head
right
now
over
that
blotched
brand
trying
to
the
play
which
he
wo
not
in
a
thousand
years
he
gave
the
reins
a
twitch
and
began
to
climb
through
the
dusk
to
the
lighter
hilltop
at
a
point
just
east
of
cold
spring
coulee
at
the
top
he
put
the
spurs
to
his
horse
and
headed
straight
as
might
be
for
the
wishbone
ranch
he
would
like
to
have
told
val
of
his
success
but
he
was
afraid
manley
might
be
there
or
polycarp
it
was
wise
always
to
avoid
polycarp
jenks
if
one
had
anything
to
conceal
from
his
fellows
chapter
xxi
val
decides
it
was
the
middle
of
the
next
forenoon
when
manley
came
riding
home
sullen
from
drink
and
a
losing
game
of
poker
which
had
kept
him
all
night
at
the
table
and
at
sunrise
sent
him
forth
in
the
mood
which
meets
a
grievance
more
than
he
did
not
stop
at
the
house
though
he
saw
val
through
the
open
door
he
did
not
trouble
to
speak
to
her
even
but
rode
on
to
the
stable
stopping
at
the
corral
to
look
over
the
fence
at
the
calves
still
bawling
sporadically
between
nibblings
at
the
hay
which
polycarp
had
thrown
in
to
them
just
at
first
he
did
not
notice
anything
wrong
but
soon
a
vague
disquiet
seized
him
and
he
frowned
thoughtfully
at
the
little
group
something
puzzled
him
but
his
brain
fogged
with
whisky
and
loss
of
sleep
and
the
reaction
from
hours
of
concentration
upon
the
game
could
not
quite
grasp
the
thing
that
troubled
him
in
a
moment
however
he
gave
an
inarticulate
bellow
wheeled
about
and
rode
back
to
the
house
he
threw
himself
from
the
horse
almost
before
it
stopped
and
rushed
into
the
kitchen
val
ironing
one
of
her
ruffled
white
aprons
looked
up
quickly
turned
rather
pale
and
then
stiffened
perceptibly
for
the
conflict
that
was
coming
there
only
four
calves
in
the
corral
and
i
brought
in
five
where
the
other
one
he
came
up
and
stood
quite
close
to
her
so
close
that
val
took
a
step
backward
he
did
not
speak
loud
but
there
was
something
in
his
tone
in
his
look
that
drove
the
little
remaining
color
from
her
face
manley
she
said
with
a
catch
of
the
breath
why
did
you
do
that
horrible
thing
what
devil
possessed
you
i
i
asked
you
is
that
other
calf
where
is
it
there
only
four
i
brought
in
his
very
calmness
was
terrifying
val
threw
back
her
head
and
her
eyes
were
as
they
frequently
became
in
moments
of
stress
yellow
inscrutable
like
the
eyes
of
a
lion
in
a
cage
yes
you
brought
in
five
one
of
the
five
at
least
you
stole
you
put
your
brand
manley
fleetwood
on
a
calf
that
did
not
belong
to
you
it
belonged
to
the
wishbone
and
you
know
it
i
have
learned
many
disagreeable
things
about
you
manley
in
the
past
two
years
yesterday
morning
i
learned
that
you
were
a
i
despise
you
stealing
from
the
very
men
who
helped
you
the
men
to
whom
you
owe
nothing
but
gratitude
and
and
friendship
have
you
no
manhood
whatever
besides
being
weak
and
shiftless
are
you
a
criminal
as
well
can
you
be
so
utterly
lacking
in
in
common
decency
even
she
eyed
him
as
she
would
look
at
some
strange
monster
in
a
museum
about
which
she
was
rather
curious
i
asked
you
where
that
other
calf
is
and
you
better
tell
me
it
was
the
tone
which
goes
well
with
a
knife
thrust
or
a
blow
but
the
contempt
in
val
face
did
not
change
well
you
have
to
hunt
for
it
if
you
want
it
the
cow
a
wishbone
cow
mind
you
came
and
claimed
it
i
let
her
have
it
no
stolen
goods
can
remain
on
this
ranch
with
my
knowledge
manley
fleetwood
please
remember
oh
you
turned
it
out
did
you
you
turned
it
out
he
had
her
by
the
throat
shaking
her
as
a
puppy
shakes
a
purloined
shoe
i
could
you
for
that
manley
it
was
not
pleasant
that
gurgling
cry
as
she
straggled
to
get
free
he
had
the
look
of
a
maniac
as
he
pressed
his
fingers
into
her
throat
and
glared
down
into
her
purpling
face
with
a
sudden
impulse
he
cast
her
limp
form
violently
from
him
she
struck
against
a
chair
fell
from
that
to
the
floor
and
lay
a
huddled
heap
her
crisp
ruffled
skirt
just
giving
a
glimpse
of
tiny
slippers
her
yellow
hair
fallen
loose
and
hiding
her
face
he
stared
down
at
her
but
he
felt
no
remorse
she
had
jeopardized
his
liberty
his
standing
among
men
a
cold
horror
caught
him
when
he
thought
of
the
calf
turned
loose
on
the
range
his
brand
on
its
ribs
he
rushed
in
a
panic
from
the
kitchen
flung
himself
into
the
saddle
and
went
off
across
the
coulee
whipping
both
sides
of
his
horse
she
had
not
told
him
indeed
he
had
not
asked
her
which
way
the
cow
had
gone
but
instinctively
he
rode
to
the
west
the
direction
from
which
he
had
driven
the
calves
one
thought
possessed
him
utterly
he
must
find
that
calf
so
he
rode
here
and
there
doubling
and
turning
to
search
every
feeding
herd
he
glimpsed
fearing
to
face
the
possibility
of
failure
and
its
inevitable
consequence
the
cat
with
the
white
spots
on
its
sides
val
called
her
mary
arabella
for
some
whimsical
reason
came
into
the
kitchen
looked
inquiringly
at
the
huddled
figure
upon
the
floor
gave
a
faint
mew
and
went
slowly
up
purring
and
arching
her
back
she
snuffed
a
moment
at
val
hair
then
settled
herself
in
the
hollow
of
val
arm
and
curled
down
for
a
nap
the
sun
sliding
up
to
midday
shone
straight
in
upon
them
through
the
open
door
polycarp
jenks
riding
that
way
in
obedience
to
some
obscure
impulse
lifted
his
hand
to
give
his
customary
before
he
walked
in
saw
val
lying
there
and
almost
fell
headlong
into
the
room
in
his
haste
and
perturbation
it
looked
very
much
as
if
he
had
at
last
stumbled
upon
the
horrible
tragedy
which
was
his
one
daydream
to
be
an
eyewitness
of
a
murder
and
to
be
able
to
tell
the
tale
afterward
with
minute
horrifying
detail
that
to
polycarp
would
make
life
really
worth
living
he
shuffled
over
to
val
pushed
aside
the
mass
of
yellow
hair
turned
her
head
so
that
he
could
look
into
her
face
saw
at
once
the
bruised
marks
upon
her
throat
and
stood
up
very
straight
foul
play
has
been
done
here
he
exclaimed
melodramatically
eying
the
cat
sternly
murder
that
what
it
is
by
granny
a
foul
murder
the
victim
of
the
foul
murder
stirred
slightly
polycarp
started
and
bent
over
her
again
somewhat
disconcerted
perhaps
but
more
humanly
anxious
mis
fleetwood
mis
fleetwood
you
hurt
it
polycarp
jenks
talkin
to
you
he
hesitated
pushed
the
cat
away
lifted
val
with
some
difficulty
and
carried
her
into
the
front
room
and
deposited
her
on
the
couch
then
he
hurried
after
some
water
come
might
nigh
bein
a
murder
by
granny
from
the
marks
on
neck
come
might
nigh
all
right
he
sprinkled
water
lavishly
upon
her
face
bethought
him
of
a
possible
whisky
flask
in
the
haystack
and
ran
every
step
of
the
way
there
and
back
he
found
a
discarded
bottle
with
a
very
little
left
in
it
and
forced
the
liquor
down
her
throat
that
fetch
ye
if
anything
will
he
mumbled
tittering
from
sheer
excitement
beyond
a
very
natural
desire
to
do
what
he
could
for
her
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
bring
her
to
her
senses
so
that
he
could
hear
what
had
happened
and
how
it
had
happened
betche
man
got
jealous
of
kenneth
by
granny
i
betche
that
how
it
come
about
hey
feelin
better
mis
fleetwood
val
had
opened
her
eyes
and
was
looking
at
him
rather
stupidly
there
was
a
bruise
upon
her
head
as
well
as
upon
her
throat
she
had
been
stunned
and
her
wits
came
back
slowly
when
she
recognized
polycarp
she
tried
ineffectually
to
sit
up
i
he
is
he
gone
her
voice
was
husky
her
speech
labored
man
you
mean
he
gone
yes
do
you
be
afeared
not
whilst
i
here
by
granny
how
came
it
he
done
this
to
ye
val
was
still
staring
at
him
bewilderedly
polycarp
repeated
his
question
three
times
before
the
blank
look
left
her
eyes
i
turned
the
calf
out
the
cow
came
and
claimed
it
manley
she
lifted
her
hand
as
if
it
were
very
very
heavy
and
fumbled
at
her
throat
manley
when
i
told
him
he
was
a
thief
she
dropped
her
hand
wearily
to
her
side
and
closed
her
eyes
as
if
the
sight
of
polycarp
face
so
close
to
hers
and
so
insatiably
curious
and
eager
and
cunning
was
more
than
she
could
bear
go
away
she
commanded
after
a
minute
or
two
i
all
right
nothing
i
fell
it
was
the
heat
thank
you
so
much
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
him
there
still
she
looked
at
him
gravely
speculatively
she
waved
her
hand
toward
the
bedroom
get
me
my
hand
glass
in
there
on
the
dresser
she
said
when
he
had
tiptoed
in
and
got
it
for
her
she
lifted
it
up
slowly
with
both
hands
until
she
could
see
her
throat
there
were
distinct
telltale
marks
upon
the
tender
flesh
unmistakable
finger
prints
she
shivered
and
dropped
the
glass
to
the
floor
but
she
stared
steadily
up
at
polycarp
and
after
a
moment
she
spoke
with
a
certain
fierceness
polycarp
jenks
do
ever
tell
about
those
marks
i
i
do
want
any
one
to
know
when
after
a
while
i
want
to
think
first
perhaps
you
can
help
me
go
away
now
not
away
from
the
ranch
but
let
me
think
i
all
right
or
i
will
be
please
polycarp
recognized
that
tone
however
it
might
be
hoarsened
by
bruised
muscles
and
the
shock
of
what
she
had
suffered
he
recognized
also
that
look
in
her
eyes
he
had
always
obeyed
that
look
and
that
tone
he
obeyed
them
now
though
with
visible
reluctance
he
sat
down
in
the
kitchen
to
wait
and
while
he
waited
he
chewed
tobacco
incessantly
and
ruminated
upon
the
mystery
which
lay
behind
the
few
words
val
had
first
spoken
before
she
realized
just
what
it
was
she
was
saying
after
a
long
long
while
so
long
that
even
polycarp
patience
was
feeling
the
strain
val
opened
the
door
and
stood
leaning
weakly
against
the
casing
her
throat
was
swathed
in
a
piece
of
white
silk
i
wish
polycarp
you
get
the
team
and
hitch
it
to
the
light
rig
she
said
i
want
to
go
to
town
and
i
do
feel
able
to
drive
can

take
me
in
can

val
interrupted
chillingly
i

going
because

want

arline
she
raised
her
hand
to
the
bandage
i
have
a
sore
throat
she
stated
staring
hard
at
him
then
with
one
of
her
impulsive
changes
she
smiled
wistfully
you
be
my
friend
polycarp
wo

she
pleaded
i
can
trust

my
secret

a
quarrel
about

what
he
was
doing
he
mean
to
hurt
me
but
i
fell
i
struck
my
head
see
there
is
a
great
lump
she
pushed
back
her
hair
to
show
him
the
place
so
it
a
secret
just
between
you
and
me
polycarp
jenks
why
certainly
mis
fleetwood
do

the
least
mite

your
friend

feller

polycarp

straight
and
dignified
i
hope

fleetwood
you

always

polycarp
jenks
he
replied
virtuously
your
secret

safe
with
val
smiled
somewhat
doubtfully
it
is
true
and
let
him
go
maybe
it
is
i
hope
so
she
sighed
as
she
turned
away
to
dress
for
the
trip
all
through
that
long
ride
to
town
polycarp
talked
and
talked
and
talked
he
made
surmises
and
waited
openly
to
hear
them
confirmed
or
denied
he
gave
her
advice
he
told
her
everything
he
had
ever
heard
about
manley
or
had
seen
or
knew
from
some
other
source
everything
that
is
save
what
was
good
the
sums
he
had
lost
at
poker
or
had
borrowed
the
debts
he
owed
to
the
merchants
the
reputation
he
had
for
talking
big
and
doing
little
the
trouble
he
had
had
with
this
man
and
that
man
and
what
he
did
not
know
for
a
certainty
he
guessed
at
and
so
kept
the
subject
alive
true
val
did
not
speak
at
all
except
when
he
asked
her
how
she
felt
then
she
would
reply
dully
pretty
well
thank
you
invariably
those
were
the
words
she
used
whenever
he
stole
a
furtive
sidelong
glance
at
her
she
was
staring
straight
ahead
at
the
great
undulating
prairie
with
the
brown
ribbon
which
was
the
trail
thrown
carelessly
across
to
the
sky
line
polycarp
suspected
that
she
did
not
see
anything
she
just
stared
with
her
eyes
while
her
thoughts
were
somewhere
else
he
was
not
even
sure
that
she
heard
what
he
was
saying
he
thought
she
must
be
pretty
sick
she
was
so
pale
and
she
had
such
wide
purple
rings
under
her
eyes
also
he
rather
resented
her
desire
to
keep
her
trouble
a
secret
he
favored
telling
everybody
and
organizing
a
party
to
go
out
and
run
man
fleetwood
out
of
the
country
as
the
very
mildest
rebuke
which
the
outraged
community
could
give
and
remain
he
even
fell
silent
daring
the
last
three
or
four
miles
while
he
dwelt
longingly
upon
the
keen
pleasure
there
would
be
in
leading
such
an
expedition
you
remember
polycarp
not
to
speak
of
this
val
urged
abruptly
when
he
drew
up
before
the
hawley
hotel
not
a
hint
you
know
until
until
i
give
you
permission
you
oh
certainly
mis
fleetwood
certainly
do
you
be
a
mite
but
the
tone
of
polycarp
was
dejected
in
the
extreme
and
please
be
ready
to
drive
me
back
in
the
morning
i
should
like
to
be
at
the
ranch
by
noon
at
the
with
that
she
left
him
and
went
into
the
hotel
chapter
xxii
a
friend
in
need
and
so
val
finished
rather
apathetically
pushing
back
the
fallen
lock
of
hair
it
has
come
to
that
i
ca
remain
here
and
keep
any
shred
of
all
my
life
i
been
taught
to
believe
divorce
a
terrible
thing
a
crime
almost
now
i
think
it
is
sometimes
a
crime
to
be
divorced
for
months
i
have
been
coming
slowly
to
a
decision
so
this
is
really
not
as
sudden
as
it
may
seem
to
you
it
is
humiliating
to
be
compelled
to
borrow
money
but
i
would
much
rather
ask
you
than
any
of
my
own
people
my
pride
is
going
to
suffer
enough
when
i
meet
them
as
it
is
i
ca
let
them
know
just
how
miserable
and
sordid
a
failure
arline
gave
an
inarticulate
snort
bent
her
scrawny
body
nearly
double
and
reached
frankly
into
her
stocking
she
fumbled
there
a
moment
and
straightened
triumphantly
grasping
a
flat
buckskin
bag
i
feel
like
shakin
you
if
you
went
to
anybody
else
but
me
she
declared
untying
the
bag
i
know
what
men
is
lord
knows
i
see
enough
of
and
their
meanness
and
if
i
can
help
a
woman
outa
the
clutches
of
one
i
tickled
to
death
to
git
the
chancet
i
ai
sayin
they
all
of
bad
i
afford
to
give
the
devil
his
due
and
still
say
that
men
is
the
limit
the
good
ones
is
so
durn
scarce
it
ai
one
woman
in
fifty
lucky
enough
to
git
one
all
i
blame
you
for
is
stayin
with
him
as
long
as
you
have
i
of
quit
long
ago
i
was
beginnin
to
think
you
never
would
come
to
your
senses
but
you
had
to
fight
that
thing
out
for
yourself
every
woman
has
to
i
glad
you
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
man
fleetwood
did
git
a
deed
to
you
body
and
soul
when
he
married
you
you
been
actin
as
if
you
thought
he
had
and
i
glad
you
got
sense
enough
to
pull
outa
the
game
when
you
know
the
best
you
can
expect
is
the
worst
of
it
there
ai
no
hope
for
man
fleetwood
i
seen
that
when
he
went
back
to
drinkin
again
after
you
was
burnt
out
i
did
think
that
would
steady
him
down
but
he
ai
the
kind
that
braces
up
when
trouble
hits
him
he
the
sort
that
stays
down
ruther
than
go
to
the
trouble
of
gittin
up
he
hopeless
now
as
a
rotten
egg
and
has
been
for
the
last
year
here
you
take
the
hull
works
and
if
you
need
more
i
can
easy
git
it
for
you
by
sendin
in
to
the
oh
but
this
is
too
much
val
protested
when
she
had
counted
the
money
you
so
good
but
really
and
truly
i
wo
need
half
arline
pushed
away
the
proffered
money
impatiently
time
are
you
goin
to
tell
how
much
you
need
lem
me
tell
you
val
peyson
i
goin
to
call
you
by
his
name
no
more
the
dirty
cur
i
been
that
money
in
my
stockin
for
six
months
jest
to
have
it
handy
when
you
wanted
it
divorces
cost
marriage
licenses
as
you
find
out
when
you
git
started
and
you
why
the
idea
val
pursed
her
lips
with
something
like
her
old
spirit
how
could
know
i
need
to
borrow
money
i
did
know
it
myself
even
i
well
i
see
through
a
wall
when
there
a
knothole
in
it
paraphrased
arline
calmly
you
may
not
know
it
but
you
been
gittin
your
notions
knocked
outa
you
pretty
fast
the
last
year
or
so
it
was
all
a
question
of
what
kinda
stuff
you
was
made
of
underneath
you
put
a
polish
on
most
anything
so
i
could
tell
right
at
first
what
there
was
to
you
but
you
all
right
i
seen
that
a
long
time
back
and
so
i
knowed
durn
well
you
be
wantin
money
to
pull
loose
with
it
takes
money
though
i
know
it
ai
polite
to
say
much
about
real
dollars
cents
you
likely
use
every
cent
of
that
before
you
through
with
the
deal
and
remember
there
a
lot
more
growin
on
the
same
bush
if
you
need
it
it
only
waitin
to
be
val
stared
found
her
eyes
blurring
so
that
she
could
not
see
and
with
a
sudden
impulsive
movement
leaned
over
and
put
her
arms
around
arline
unkempt
scrawny
and
wholly
unlovely
though
she
was
arline
you
an
angel
of
goodness
she
cried
brokenly
you
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
in
my
life
i
had
many
who
petted
me
and
flattered
me
but
you
you
things
i
ashamed
because
i
have
loved
you
every
minute
since
i
first
saw
you
i
judged
you
i
mean
oh
you
pure
shining
gold
inside
instead
of
oh
git
out
arline
was
compelled
to
gulp
twice
before
she
could
say
even
that
much
i
do
shine
nowhere
inside
er
out
i
know
that
well
enough
i
never
had
no
chancet
to
shine
it
always
been
wore
off
with
hard
knocks
but
i
like
shiny
folks
all
right
when
they
fine
clear
through
and
arline
dear
i
do
love
you
i
always
shall
i
arline
loosened
her
clasp
and
jumped
up
precipitately
git
out
she
repeated
bashfully
if
you
git
me
to
cryin
val
peyson
i
wish
you
was
in
halifax
you
go
to
bed
go
to
sleep
er
i
she
almost
ran
from
the
room
outside
she
stopped
in
a
darkened
corner
of
the
hallway
and
stood
for
some
minutes
with
her
checked
gingham
apron
pressed
tightly
over
her
face
and
several
times
she
sniffed
audibly
when
she
finally
returned
to
the
kitchen
her
nose
was
pink
her
eyelids
were
pink
and
she
was
extremely
petulant
when
she
caught
minnie
eying
her
curiously
val
had
refused
to
eat
any
supper
and
beyond
telling
arline
that
she
had
decided
to
leave
manley
and
return
to
her
mother
in
fern
hill
she
had
not
explained
anything
very
clearly
her
colorless
face
for
instance
nor
her
tightly
swathed
throat
nor
the
very
noticeable
bruise
upon
her
temple
arline
had
not
asked
a
single
question
now
however
she
spent
some
time
fixing
a
tray
with
the
daintiest
food
she
knew
and
could
procure
and
took
it
upstairs
with
a
certain
diffidence
in
her
manner
and
a
rare
tenderness
in
her
faded
eyes
you
got
to
eat
you
know
she
reminded
val
gently
you
bucking
up
the
hardest
part
of
the
trail
and
grub
a
necessity
take
it
like
you
would
medicine
unless
your
throat
too
sore
i
see
you
got
it
all
tied
val
raised
her
hands
in
a
swift
alarm
and
clasped
her
throat
as
if
she
feared
arline
would
remove
the
bandages
oh
it
not
sore
that
is
it
is
sore
i
mean
not
very
much
she
stammered
betrayingly
arline
set
down
the
tray
upon
the
dresser
and
faced
val
grimly
i
never
asked
you
any
questions
did
i
she
demanded
but
you
act
for
all
the
world
as
if
do
you
want
me
to
give
a
guess
about
that
neck
and
that
lump
on
your
forehead
i
never
asked
any
questions
i
did
need
to
man
fleetwood
been
maulin
you
abound
i
was
kinda
afraid
he
git
to
that
point
some
day
when
he
got
mad
enough
just
the
brand
to
beat
up
a
woman
but
if
it
took
a
beatin
to
bring
you
to
the
quitting
point
i
glad
he
done
it
she
added
darkly
he
better
keep
outa
my
reach
i
jest
in
the
humor
to
claw
him
up
some
if
i
should
git
close
enough
and
if
i
happened
to
forget
i
a
lady
i
sure
bawl
him
out
and
the
bigger
crowd
heard
me
the
better
now
you
eat
this
and
do
get
the
idee
you
can
cover
up
any
meanness
of
man
fleetwood
not
from
me
anyhow
i
know
men
you
do
you
tell
me
nothing
about
that
would
me
the
least
bit
i
only
thankful
he
did
murder
you
in
cold
blood
are
you
going
to
eat
not
if
you
keep
on
reminding
me
of
such
things
wailed
val
and
sobbed
into
her
pillow
it
bad
enough
to
to
have
him
me
without
having
you
about
it
all
the
time
now
honey
do
you
waste
no
tears
on
a
brute
like
him
he
ai
it
arline
was
on
her
bony
knees
beside
the
bed
crying
with
sympathy
and
so
in
truly
feminine
fashion
the
two
wept
their
way
back
to
the
solid
ground
of
everyday
living
before
they
reached
that
desirable
state
of
composure
however
val
told
her
everything
within
certain
limits
set
not
by
caution
but
rather
by
her
woman
instinct
she
did
not
for
instance
say
much
about
kent
though
she
regretted
openly
that
polycarp
knew
so
much
about
it
hope
never
needed
no
newspaper
so
long
as
polycarp
lives
here
arline
grumbled
when
val
was
sitting
up
again
and
trying
to
eat
arline
toast
and
jelly
made
of
buffalo
berries
and
sipping
the
tea
which
had
gone
cold
but
if
i
can
round
him
up
in
time
i
try
and
git
him
to
keep
his
mouth
shet
i
scare
the
liver
outa
him
some
way
but
if
he
caught
onto
that
calf
deal
she
shook
her
head
doubtfully
the
worst
of
it
is
fred
in
town
and
he
always
pumpin
polycarp
dry
jest
to
find
out
all
that
goin
on
you
go
to
bed
and
i
see
if
i
can
find
out
whether
they
together
if
they
are
but
you
need
to
worry
none
i
reckon
a
match
for
the
both
of
why
i
dope
their
coffee
and
send
both
to
sleep
till
man
got
outa
the
country
if
i
had
to
she
stood
with
her
hands
upon
her
angular
hips
and
glared
at
val
i
sure
would
do
that
very
thing
for
she
reiterated
solemnly
i
do
purtend
i
do
it
for
man
but
i
would
for
you
but
it
likely
kent
has
fixed
things
up
so
they
ca
git
nothing
on
man
if
they
try
he
would
if
he
said
he
would
that
there
feller
that
on
the
square
you
go
to
bed
now
whilst
i
go
on
a
still
hunt
of
my
own
i
come
and
tell
you
if
there
anything
to
it
was
easy
enough
to
make
the
promise
but
keeping
it
was
so
difficult
that
she
yielded
to
the
temptation
of
going
to
bed
and
letting
val
sleep
in
peace
which
she
could
not
have
done
if
she
had
known
that
polycarp
jenks
and
fred
de
garmo
left
town
on
horseback
within
an
hour
after
polycarp
had
entered
it
and
that
they
told
no
man
their
errand
over
behind
brinberg
store
polycarp
had
told
fred
all
he
knew
all
he
suspected
and
all
he
believed
would
come
to
pass
strictly
on
the
quiet
of
course
he
reminded
fred
of
that
over
and
over
because
he
had
promised
fleetwood
that
he
would
not
mention
it
but
by
granny
he
apologized
i
did
like
the
idee
of
keepin
thing
like
that
from
it
would
kinda
look
as
if
i
was
standin
in
on
the
deal
which
i
ai
nobody
ca
accuse
me
of
rustlin
no
matter
what
else
i
might
do
you
know
that
sure
i
know
you
honest
anyway
fred
responded
quite
sincerely
well
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
i
kinda
had
my
suspicions
all
fall
that
there
was
somethin
scaly
goin
on
at
cold
spring
looked
to
me
like
man
had
too
blamed
many
calves
missed
by
spring
for
the
size
of
his
herd
i
dunno
of
course
jest
where
he
gits
you
have
to
find
that
out
but
he
brung
twelve
er
fourteen
to
the
ranch
two
er
three
at
a
time
and
what
she
said
when
she
first
come
to
told
me
right
out
by
granny
man
choked
her
because
she
called
a
thief
and
somethin
about
a
cow
comin
an
claimin
her
calf
and
her
turnin
it
out
that
oughta
be
might
nigh
all
the
evidence
you
need
fred
if
you
find
it
she
do
know
she
said
it
but
she
would
of
told
it
by
granny
if
it
was
so
now
would
she
and
you
say
all
this
happened
fred
pondered
for
a
minute
queer
because
i
almost
caught
a
fellow
last
night
doing
some
funny
work
on
a
calf
a
wishbone
cow
it
was
and
her
calf
fresh
burned
a
brand
by
thunder
if
it
was
i
say
man
found
it
and
blotched
the
brand
i
wish
now
i
hazed
them
over
to
the
double
diamond
and
corralled
like
i
had
a
mind
to
but
we
can
find
them
easy
enough
but
that
was
last
night
and
you
say
this
big
setting
came
off
you
polly
i
polycarp
waggled
his
head
solemnly
he
was
enjoying
himself
to
the
limit
he
was
the
man
on
the
inside
giving
out
information
of
the
greatest
importance
and
an
officer
of
the
law
was
hanging
anxiously
upon
his
words
he
spoke
slowly
giving
weight
to
every
word
i
rode
up
to
the
house
man
house
somewhere
close
to
noon
an
there
she
was
on
the
kitchen
floor
did
know
nothin
an
had
the
marks
of
fingers
on
throat
the
rest
of
her
neck
so
white
they
showed
up
by
granny
like
like
polycarp
never
could
think
of
a
simile
he
always
expectorated
in
such
an
emergency
and
left
his
sentence
unfinished
he
did
so
now
and
fred
cut
in
unfeelingly
never
mind
that
you
gone
over
it
half
a
dozen
times
you
say
it
was
at
noon
or
thereabouts
man
must
have
done
it
when
he
found
out
she
turned
the
calf
loose
he
would
unless
he
was
pretty
mad
and
scared
he
is
enough
to
wait
till
he
barred
out
the
brand
and
then
go
home
and
choke
his
wife
he
did
know
about
the
calf
till
that
a
he
studied
the
matter
with
an
air
of
grave
importance
polycarp
he
said
abruptly
i
going
to
need
you
we
got
to
find
that
bunch
of
cattle
it
ought
to
be
easy
enough
and
haze
down
into
man
field
where
his
bunch
of
calves
are
see
any
calf
that
been
weaned
in
the
last
three
weeks
will
be
pretty
likely
to
claim
its
mother
and
if
he
got
any
calves
branded
that
claim
cows
with
some
other
brand
well
he
threw
out
his
hands
in
a
comprehensive
gesture
that
the
quickest
way
i
know
to
get
him
he
said
i
want
a
witness
along
and
some
help
and
you
he
eyed
polycarp
keenly
ai
safe
running
around
town
loose
all
your
brains
seem
to
leak
out
your
mouth
so
you
come
along
with
well
any
time
after
hedged
polycarp
offended
by
the
implication
that
he
talked
too
much
i
got
to
drive
the
team
home
for
mis
fleetwood
i
tol
her
i
would
well
you
wo
you
going
to
hit
the
trail
with
me
just
as
soon
as
i
can
find
a
horse
for
you
to
ride
we
sleep
at
the
double
diamond
and
start
from
there
in
the
morning
and
if
i
catch
you
letting
a
word
outa
you
about
this
deal
i
just
about
have
to
arrest
you
for
he
did
not
quite
know
what
but
the
very
vagueness
of
the
threat
had
its
effect
upon
polycarp
he
went
without
further
argument
though
first
he
went
to
the
hawley
hotel
with
fred
close
beside
him
as
a
precaution
against
imprudent
gossip
and
left
word
in
the
office
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
drive
fleetwood
home
the
next
morning
but
would
be
back
to
take
her
out
the
day
after
that
if
she
did
not
mind
staying
in
town
it
was
that
message
which
arline
deliberately
held
back
from
val
until
morning
you
better
stay
here
she
advised
then
polycarp
an
fred
up
to
some
devilment
that
a
cinch
but
whatever
it
is
you
better
off
right
here
with
me
you
should
drive
out
there
and
run
into
man
what
then
val
shivered
i
that
the
only
thing
i
ca
bear
she
admitted
as
if
the
time
for
proud
dignity
and
reserve
had
gone
by
if
i
could
be
sure
i
would
need
to
meet
him
i
rather
go
alone
really
and
truly
i
would
you
know
the
horses
are
perfectly
safe
i
driven
them
to
town
fifty
times
if
i
have
once
i
had
to
out
there
alone
so
much
of
the
time
rather
not
have
polycarp
spying
around
i
got
to
pack
up
there
are
so
many
things
of
no
value
to
to
things
i
brought
out
here
with
me
and
there
are
all
my
manuscripts
i
ca
leave
them
lying
around
even
if
they
are
worth
anything
especially
since
they
are
worth
she
pushed
back
her
hair
with
a
weary
movement
if
i
could
only
be
sure
if
i
knew
where
is
she
sighed
i
lend
you
my
gun
arline
offered
in
good
faith
if
he
comes
around
you
and
starts
any
funny
business
again
you
can
stand
him
off
even
if
you
got
some
delicate
feelin
about
blowin
his
brains
oh
i
could
i
deadly
afraid
of
val
shuddered
well
then
you
ca
go
atone
i
go
with
you
if
you
could
git
packed
up
so
as
to
come
back
i
guess
min
could
make
out
to
git
two
meals
oh
no
really
and
truly
arline
i
just
as
soon
go
alone
i
would
rather
arline
was
not
accustomed
to
being
called
she
surrendered
with
some
confusion
and
a
blush
well
you
better
wait
she
admonished
temporizingly
something
may
turn
presently
something
did
turn
up
she
rushed
breathlessly
into
val
room
and
caught
her
by
the
arm
now
your
chancet

she
hissed
in
a
loud
whisper

she
went
to
the
stable
with
val
her
apron
thrown
over
her
head
for
want
of
a
hat
when
val
was
settling
herself
in
the
seat
arline
caught
at
the
wheel
say
time
you

to

trunks
loaded
into
the
wagon
she
cried
you

parsed
her
lips
she
had
not
thought
of
that
but
polycarp
will
come
by
the
time
i
am
ready
she
decided
you
could
keep
him
away
arline
he
would
be
afraid
he
might
miss
something
because
i
suppose
ours
is
the
only
ranch
in
the
country
where
the
wheels
are
turning
smoothly
polycarp
and
i
can
hank
grinning
under
his
ragged
brown
mustache
handed
her
the
lines

got
my
orders
he
told
her
briefly
i
watch
out
the
trail
kept
oh
thank

i
so
many
good
friends
val
answered
giving
him
a
smile
to
stir
his
sluggish
blood
arline
do
worry
about
me
there
a
dear
i
shall
not
be
back
before
night
both
arline
and
hank
stood
where
they
were
and
watched
her
out
of
sight
before
they
turned
back
to
the
sordid
tasks
which
made
up
their
lives
she
make
it
she
the
proper
stuff
hank
remarked
and
lighted
his
pipe
arline
for
a
wonder
sighed
and
said
nothing
chapter
xxiii
caught
after
two
nights
and
a
day
of
torment
unbearable
kent
bolted
from
his
work
which
would
have
taken
him
that
day
as
it
had
done
the
day
before
in
a
direction
opposite
to
that
which
his
mind
and
his
heart
followed
and
without
apology
or
explanation
to
his
foreman
rode
straight
to
cold
spring
coulee
he
had
no
very
definite
plan
except
to
see
val
he
did
not
even
know
what
he
would
say
when
he
faced
her
michael
was
steaming
from
nose
to
tail
when
he
stopped
at
the
yard
gate
which
shows
how
impatience
had
driven
his
master
kent
glanced
quickly
around
the
place
as
he
walked
up
the
narrow
path
to
the
house
nothing
was
changed
in
the
slightest
particular
as
far
as
he
could
see
and
he
realized
then
that
he
had
been
uneasy
as
well
as
anxious
both
doors
were
closed
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
knock
before
val
became
visible
he
had
a
fleeting
impression
of
extreme
caution
in
the
way
she
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
but
he
forgot
it
immediately
in
his
joy
at
seeing
her
oh
it
you
come
in
and
you
wo
mind
if
i
close
the
door
i
afraid
i
the
victim
of
nerves
why
kent
was
instantly
solicitous
has
anything
happened
since
i
was
here
val
shook
her
head
smiling
faintly
nothing
that
need
to
worry
pal
i
do
want
to
talk
about
worries
i
want
to
be
cheered
up
i
laughed
kent
for
so
long
i
afraid
my
facial
muscles
are
getting
stiff
say
something
funny
ca
you
kent
pushed
his
hat
far
back
on
his
head
and
sat
down
upon
a
corner
of
the
table
such
is
life
in
the
far
west
and
the
farther
west
you
go
the
livelier
he
began
to
declaim
dutifully
the
livelier
it
gets
yes
i
heard
that
a
million
tunes
i
believe
i
ca
laugh
at
that
i
never
did
think
it
she
sighed
and
twitched
her
shoulders
impatiently
because
of
it
i
see
you
brought
back
the
glasses
she
remarked
inanely
you
certainly
were
in
any
great
hurry
were
you
oh
they
had
us
riding
over
east
of
the
home
ranch
hazing
in
some
outa
the
hills
i
supposed
to
be
over
there
right
now
but
i
ai
i
expect
i
get
the
can
all
right
if
you
going
away
what
do
you
care
she
taunted
h
sure
what
do
i
care
he
eyed
her
from
under
his
brows
while
he
bent
to
light
a
match
upon
the
sole
of
his
boot
val
had
long
ago
settled
his
compunctions
about
smoking
in
her
presence
you
seem
to
be
all
tore
up
here
he
observed
irrelevantly
cleaning
house
yes
cleaning
val
smiled
ambiguously
hubby
in
town
yes
he
went
in
yesterday
and
has
come
back
kent
smoked
for
a
moment
meditatively
i
found
that
calf
all
right
he
informed
her
at
last
it
was
too
late
to
ride
around
this
way
and
tell
you
that
night
so
you
need
worry
any
more
about
i
not
worrying
about
val
stooped
and
picked
up
a
hairpin
from
the
floor
and
twirled
it
absently
in
her
fingers
i
do
think
it
matters
any
more
yesterday
afternoon
fred
de
garmo
and
polycarp
jenks
came
into
the
coulee
with
a
bunch
of
cattle
and
turned
all
the
calves
out
of
the
river
field
with
them
and
after
a
little
they
drove
the
whole
lot
of
them
away
somewhere
over
that
she
waved
a
slim
hand
to
the
west
they
let
out
the
calves
in
the
corral
too
i
saw
them
from
the
window
but
i
did
ask
them
any
questions
i
really
did
need
to
did
i
she
grazed
him
with
a
glance
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
failed
to
find
that
calf
i
glad
you
did
though
so
it
was
that
started
them
hunting
around
here
polycarp
and
fred
i
kent
looked
at
her
queerly
her
voice
was
without
any
emotion
whatever
as
if
the
subject
held
no
personal
interest
for
her
he
finished
his
cigarette
and
threw
the
stub
out
into
the
yard
before
either
of
them
spoke
another
word
he
closed
the
door
again
stood
there
for
a
minute
making
up
his
mind
and
went
slowly
over
to
where
she
was
sitting
listlessly
in
a
chair
her
hands
folded
loosely
in
her
lap
he
gripped
with
one
hand
the
chairback
and
stared
down
at
her
yellow
hair
how
long
do
you
think
i
going
to
stand
around
and
let
you
be
dragged
into
trouble
like
this
he
began
abruptly
you
know
what
i
told
you
the
other
day
i
could
say
the
same
thing
over
again
and
a
lot
more
and
mean
more
than
i
could
find
words
for
maybe
you
can
stand
this
sort
of
thing
i
ca
i
not
going
to
try
if
you
bound
to
stick
to
that
that
gentleman
i
going
to
get
outa
the
country
where
i
ca
see
you
killed
by
inches
every
time
i
come
you
a
little
bit
whiter
and
a
little
i
ca
stand
it
i
tell
you
you
were
made
for
a
hell
like
you
living
you
were
meant
to
be
happy
and
i
was
meant
to
make
you
happy
every
morning
when
i
open
my
eyes
do
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
it
another
day
we
oughta
be
happy
in
you
and
he
took
her
suddenly
by
the
shoulder
and
brought
her
up
facing
him
where
he
could
look
into
her
eyes
we
only
got
just
one
life
to
live
val
he
pleaded
and
we
could
be
happy
together
i
stake
my
life
on
that
i
ca
go
on
forever
just
being
friends
and
eating
my
heart
out
for
you
and
seeing
you
abused
and
what
for
just
because
a
preacher
mumbled
some
words
over
you
two
only
for
that
you
would
stay
with
him
and
you
know
it
is
what
ought
to
tie
two
human
beings
together
without
love
or
even
friendship
you
hate
him
you
ca
look
me
in
the
eyes
and
say
you
do
and
he
tired
of
you
some
other
woman
would
please
him
better
and
i
could
make
you
happy
val
broke
away
from
his
grasp
and
retreated
until
the
table
was
between
them
her
listlessness
was
a
thing
forgotten
she
was
panting
with
the
quick
beating
of
her
heart
kent
do
pal
you
must
say
those
things
it
it
true
he
cried
hotly
can
you
look
at
me
and
say
it
ai
the
truth
you
spoiled
our
friendship
kent
she
accused
while
she
evaded
his
question
it
meant
so
much
to
me
just
your
dear
good
my
love
could
mean
a
whole
lot
more
he
declared
sturdily
but
you
must
say
those
things
you
must
feel
that
way
kent
oh
he
laughed
grimly
must
i
how
are
you
going
to
stop
me
he
stared
hard
at
her
his
face
growing
slowly
rigid
there
just
one
way
to
stop
me
from
saying
such
wicked
things
he
told
her
you
can
tell
me
you
do
care
anything
about
me
and
never
could
not
even
if
that
conscience
of
yours
did
butt
into
the
game
you
can
tell
me
that
and
swear
it
the
truth
and
i
leave
the
country
i
go
so
far
newer
see
me
again
so
i
never
bother
you
any
more
i
ca
promise
stop
loving
you
but
for
my
own
sake
i
sure
try
hard
he
set
his
teeth
hard
together
and
stood
quiet
watching
her
val
tied
to
answer
him
evidently
she
could
not
manage
her
voice
for
he
saw
her
begin
softly
beating
her
lips
with
her
fist
fighting
to
get
back
her
once
or
twice
he
had
seen
her
do
that
when
womanlike
the
tears
would
come
in
spite
of
her
i
do
want
you
to
go
she
articulated
at
last
with
a
hint
of
stubbornness
well
what
you
want
i
ca
stay
unless
he
did
not
attempt
to
finish
the
sentence
he
knew
there
was
no
need
she
understood
well
enough
the
alternative
for
long
minutes
she
did
not
speak
because
she
could
not
like
many
women
she
fought
desperately
against
the
tears
which
seemed
a
badge
of
her
femininity
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
dropped
her
face
upon
her
folded
arms
and
bit
her
lips
until
they
were
sore
kent
took
a
step
toward
her
reconsidered
and
went
over
to
the
window
where
he
stood
staring
moodily
out
until
she
began
speaking
even
then
he
did
not
turn
immediately
toward
her
you
need
go
kent
she
said
with
some
semblance
of
calm
because
going
i
did
tell
you
but
i
going
home
i
going
to
get
free
by
the
same
law
that
tied
me
to
him
you
are
right
i
have
a
conscience
i
think
i
was
born
with
it
it
demands
that
i
get
my
freedom
honestly
i
ca
steal
it
pal
i
could
be
happy
if
i
did
that
no
matter
how
hard
i
might
try
or
he
turned
eagerly
toward
her
then
but
she
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
no
stay
where
you
are
i
want
to
solve
my
problem
and
and
leave
you
out
of
it
you
a
complication
pal
when
you
talk
like
like
you
just
been
talking
it
makes
my
conscience
wonder
whether
i
honest
with
myself
i
got
to
leave
you
out
do
you
see
and
so
leaving
you
out
i
feel
that
any
woman
should
be
expected
to
go
on
like
i
doing
you
know
i
could
tell
you
just
how
impossible
this
marriage
of
mine
has
become
the
day
after
well
yesterday
no
the
day
before
yesterday
he
came
home
and
found
out
what
i
done
he
i
could
stay
here
after
that
so
what
did
he
do
kent
demanded
sharply
he
did
dare
to
lay
his
hands
on
you
did
he
by
do
swear
kent
i
hear
so
much
of
that
from
him
val
smiled
curiously
he
he
swore
at
me
i
could
stay
with
him
after
that
could
i
dear
whether
she
really
meant
to
speak
that
last
word
or
not
it
set
blood
dancing
so
that
he
forgot
to
urge
his
question
farther
he
took
two
eager
steps
toward
her
and
she
retreated
again
behind
the
table
kent
do
how
can
i
tell
you
anything
if
you
wo
be
good
she
waited
until
he
was
standing
rather
sulkily
by
the
window
again
anyway
it
does
matter
now
what
he
has
done
i
am
going
to
leave
him
i
going
to
get
a
divorce
not
even
the
strictest
conscience
could
demand
that
i
stay
i
perfectly
at
ease
upon
that
point
about
this
last
trouble
with
the
calves
if
i
could
help
him
i
would
of
course
but
all
i
could
say
would
only
make
matters
worse
and
i
a
wretched
failure
at
lying
i
can
help
him
more
i
think
by
going
away
i
feel
certain
going
to
be
trouble
over
those
calves
fred
de
garmo
never
would
have
come
down
here
and
driven
them
all
away
would
he
unless
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
if
he
came
in
here
and
got
the
calves
it
looks
as
if
he
meant
business
all
kent
frowned
absently
at
the
white
window
curtain
i
seen
the
time
he
added
reflectively
when
i
be
all
broke
up
to
have
man
get
into
trouble
we
used
to
be
pretty
good
friends
a
year
ago
it
would
have
broken
my
heart
val
sighed
we
do
change
so
i
ca
quite
understand
why
i
should
feel
so
indifferent
about
it
now
even
the
other
day
it
was
terrible
but
when
i
felt
his
fingers
she
stopped
guiltily
he
seems
a
stranger
to
me
now
i
do
even
hate
him
so
very
much
i
do
want
to
meet
him
neither
do
but
there
was
a
different
meaning
in
kent
tone
so
you
going
to
quit
he
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
you
leave
your
address
i
hope
oh
val
voice
betrayed
some
inward
trepidation
i
not
running
away
i
just
i
he
sighed
impatient
at
the
restraint
she
had
put
upon
him
that
do
mean
you
wo
ever
come
back
does
it
or
that
the
trains
are
going
to
quit
carrying
passengers
to
your
town
because
you
ca
keep
me
outa
your
let
me
tell
you
is
it
against
the
rules
to
ask
when
you
going
and
how
just
as
soon
as
i
can
get
my
trunks
packed
and
polycarp
or
somebody
comes
to
help
me
load
them
into
the
spring
wagon
i
promised
arline
hawley
i
would
be
in
town
i
do
know
though
i
seem
to
be
making
much
progress
with
my
she
smiled
at
him
more
brightly
let
wade
ashore
pal
and
get
to
work
instead
of
talking
about
things
better
left
alone
i
know
just
exactly
what
you
thinking
and
going
to
let
you
help
me
instead
of
polycarp
i
frightfully
angry
with
him
anyway
he
promised
me
on
his
word
of
honor
that
he
would
mention
a
thing
and
he
must
have
actually
hunted
for
a
chance
to
tell
he
have
the
nerve
to
come
to
the
house
yesterday
when
he
was
here
with
fred
perhaps
he
wo
come
after
all
so
you
have
to
help
me
make
my
getaway
kent
wavered
you
the
limit
all
right
he
told
her
after
a
period
of
hesitation
you
just
wait
old
girl
till
you
get
that
conscience
of
yours
squared
what
shall
i
do
i
can
pack
a
in
one
minute
and
and
a
horse
in
five
minutes
provided
he
do
get
gay
and
pitch
the
pack
off
a
time
or
two
and
somebody
around
to
help
throw
the
hitch
just
tell
me
where
to
start
in
and
you
wo
be
able
to
see
me
for
dust
you
seem
in
a
frightful
hurry
to
have
me
go
val
complained
laughing
nevertheless
with
the
nervous
reaction
packing
a
trunk
takes
time
and
care
and
now
is
that
awful
kent
eyes
flared
with
mirth
all
the
more
pronounced
because
it
was
entirely
superficial
well
you
take
the
time
and
care
goodpacker
and
i
cheerfully
furnish
the
intelligence
this
goes
i
reckon
he
squeezed
a
pink
cushion
into
as
small
a
space
as
possible
and
held
it
out
at
arm
length
that
goes
to
arline
put
it
in
there
val
laughter
was
not
far
from
hysteria
kent
was
pretending
to
stuff
the
pink
cushion
into
her
hand
bag
better
take
it
you
the
front
door
was
pushed
violently
open
and
manley
almost
fell
into
the
room
val
gave
a
little
inarticulate
cry
and
shrank
back
against
the
wall
before
she
could
recover
herself
they
had
for
the
moment
forgotten
manley
and
all
he
stood
for
in
the
way
of
heartbreak
a
manley
he
was
with
his
white
face
and
staring
bloodshot
eyes
and
the
cruel
animal
lines
around
his
mouth
hardly
recognizable
to
one
who
had
not
seen
him
since
three
or
four
years
before
he
would
have
been
he
stopped
short
just
over
the
threshold
and
glanced
suspiciously
from
one
to
the
other
before
he
came
farther
into
the
room
dig
up
some
grub
val
in
a
bag
so
i
can
carry
it
on
horseback
he
commanded
and
a
blanket
where
did
you
put
those
rifle
cartridges
he
hurried
across
the
room
to
where
his
rifle
and
belt
hung
upon
the
wall
just
over
the
little
homemade
bookcase
i
had
a
couple
of
boxes
where
are
they
he
snatched
down
the
rifle
took
the
belt
and
began
buckling
it
around
him
with
fumbling
fingers
mechanically
val
reached
upon
a
higher
shelf
and
got
him
the
two
boxes
of
shells
her
eyes
were
fixed
curiously
upon
his
face
what
has
happened
she
asked
him
as
he
tore
open
a
box
and
began
pushing
the
shells
one
by
one
into
his
belt
fred
de
garmo
he
tried
to
arrest
me
in
town
i
shot
him
dead
he
glanced
furtively
at
kent
can
i
take
your
horse
kent
i
want
to
get
across
the
river
before
you
shot
fred
val
was
staring
at
him
stupidly
he
whirled
savagely
toward
her
yes
and
i
shoot
any
man
that
walked
up
and
tried
to
take
me
he
was
a
fool
if
he
thought
all
he
had
to
do
was
crook
his
finger
and
say
along
it
was
over
those
calves
and
i
say
you
had
a
hand
in
it
if
i
had
found
that
calf
and
saw
how
you
burned
out
the
brand
before
you
turned
it
loose
you
might
have
told
me
i
would
have
he
shifted
his
gaze
toward
kent
the
hell
of
it
is
the
sheriff
happened
to
be
in
town
for
something
he
back
a
couple
of
miles
for
god
sake
move
and
get
that
flour
and
bacon
and
some
matches
i
got
to
get
across
the
river
i
can
shake
off
on
the
other
side
hurry
val
she
went
out
into
the
kitchen
and
they
heard
her
moving
about
collecting
the
things
he
needed
i
have
to
take
your
horse
manley
turned
to
him
with
a
certain
wheedling
tone
infinitely
disgusting
to
the
other
mine
all
in
i
rode
him
down
getting
this
far
i
got
to
get
across
the
river
and
into
the
hills
the
other
side
i
can
dodge
over
there
you
can
have
my
horse
he
good
as
yours
he
seemed
to
fed
a
slight
discomfort
at
kent
silence
you
always
stood
by
me
anyway
it
was
so
much
my
fault
he
came
at
me
unawares
and
says
fleetwood
you
my
prisoner
why
the
very
tone
of
him
was
an
insult
and
i
wo
stand
for
being
arrested
i
pulled
my
gun
and
got
him
through
the
lungs
heard
yelling
he
was
dead
hurry
up
with
that
grub
i
ca
wait
here
till
i
ought
to
tell
you
michael
no
good
for
water
kent
forced
himself
to
say
he
liable
to
turn
back
on
you
he
scared
of
he
wo
turn
back
with
not
with
old
jake
bondy
at
my
heels
manley
snatched
the
bag
of
provisions
from
val
when
she
appeared
and
started
for
the
door
you
better
leave
off
some
of
that
hardware
then
kent
advised
perfunctorily
you
liable
to
have
to
i
do
care
how
i
get
across
just
so
a
panic
seemed
to
seize
him
then
without
a
word
of
thanks
or
farewell
he
rushed
out
threw
himself
into
kent
saddle
without
taking
time
to
tie
on
his
bundle
of
bacon
and
flour
or
remembering
the
blanket
he
had
asked
for
holding
his
provisions
under
his
arm
his
rifle
in
one
hand
and
his
reins
clutched
in
the
other
he
struck
the
spurs
home
and
raced
down
the
coulee
toward
the
river
fred
and
polycarp
had
not
troubled
to
put
up
the
wire
gate
after
emptying
the
river
field
so
he
had
a
straight
run
of
it
to
the
very
river
bank
the
two
stood
together
at
the
window
and
watched
him
go
chapter
xxiv
retribution
he
thought
it
was
i
burned
out
that
brand
did
you
notice
what
he
said
val
as
frequently
happens
in
times
of
stress
spoke
first
of
a
trivial
matter
before
her
mind
would
grasp
the
greater
issues
he
never
make
it
said
kent
speaking
involuntarily
his
thought
there
comes
old
jake
bondy
now
down
the
hill
still
i
dunno
if
michael
takes
to
the
water
all
right
if
the
sheriff
comes
here
what
shall
we
tell
him
shall
we
he
wo
he
turning
off
do
you
see
he
must
have
got
a
sight
of
man
from
the
top
of
the
hill
michael
tolerably
fresh
and
jake
horse
is
that
makes
a
big
val
weakened
unexpectedly
as
the
full
meaning
of
it
all
swept
through
her
mind
oh
it
horrible
she
whispered
kent
what
can
we
do
not
a
thing
only
keep
our
heads
and
do
give
way
to
nerves
he
hinted
it
something
out
of
our
reach
let
not
go
all
to
pieces
over
it
she
steadied
under
his
calm
voice
i
always
acting
foolish
just
at
the
wrong
time
but
to
think
he
could
do
think
you
have
enough
of
that
to
do
managing
your
own
affairs
all
this
does
change
a
thing
for
you
it
makes
you
feel
bad
and
for
that
i
could
kill
him
almost
so
much
flashed
out
and
then
he
brought
himself
in
hand
again
you
still
got
to
pack
your
trunks
and
take
the
train
home
just
the
same
as
if
this
had
happened
i
did
like
the
idea
at
first
but
now
i
see
it
the
best
thing
you
can
do
for
the
present
after
awhile
we
see
about
it
do
look
out
if
it
upsets
you
val
you
ca
do
any
good
and
you
got
to
save
your
nerves
let
pull
down
the
shade
oh
i
got
to
see
perversely
she
caught
up
the
field
glasses
from
the
table
drew
them
from
their
case
and
letting
down
the
upper
window
sash
with
a
slam
focused
the
glasses
upon
the
river
he
usually
crosses
right
at
the
mouth
of
the
coulee
she
swung
the
glasses
slowly
about
oh
there
he
is
just
on
the
bank
the
river
looks
rather
high
oh
your
horse
does
want
to
go
in
kent
he
whirls
on
his
hind
feet
and
tried
to
bolt
when
manley
started
in
kent
had
been
watching
her
face
jealously
here
let
me
take
a
look
will
you
i
can
tell
she
yielded
reluctantly
and
in
a
moment
he
had
caught
the
focus
tell
me
what
you
see
kent
everything
she
begged
looking
anxiously
from
his
face
to
the
river
well
old
jake
is
fogging
along
down
the
coulee
but
he
ai
to
the
river
yet
not
by
a
long
shot
man
riding
back
to
take
a
run
in
the
stuff
got
michael
feet
wet
that
time
the
old
freak
they
came
near
going
clean
outa
the
sheriff
is
he
close
enough
val
began
fearfully
oh
we
too
far
away
to
do
a
thing
kent
kept
his
eyes
to
the
glasses
we
could
do
a
thing
if
we
were
right
there
man
in
swimming
water
already
jake
ai
riding
in
from
the
motions
he
ordering
man
oh
please
let
me
look
a
minute
i
wo
get
excited
kent
and
i
tell
you
everything
i
see
val
teeth
were
fairly
chattering
with
excitement
so
that
kent
hesitated
before
he
gave
up
the
glasses
but
it
seemed
boorish
to
refuse
she
snatched
at
them
as
he
took
them
from
his
eyes
and
placed
them
nervously
to
her
own
oh
i
see
them
both
she
cried
after
a
second
or
two
the
sheriff
got
his
rifle
in
his
hands
kent
do
you
suppose
he
just
a
bluff
pal
they
all
do
it
what
val
gave
a
start
oh
he
shot
kent
i
saw
him
take
aim
it
looked
as
if
he
pointed
it
straight
at
manley
and
the
smoke
she
moved
the
glasses
slowly
searching
the
river
well
he
have
to
be
a
dandy
to
hit
anything
on
the
water
and
with
the
sun
in
his
eyes
too
kent
assured
her
hardly
taking
his
eyes
from
her
face
with
its
varying
expression
almost
he
could
see
what
was
taking
place
at
the
river
just
by
watching
her
oh
there
manley
away
out
why
your
michael
is
swimming
beautifully
kent
his
head
is
high
out
of
the
water
and
the
water
is
churning
like
oh
manley
holding
his
rifle
up
over
his
head
he
looking
back
toward
shore
i
wonder
she
added
softly
what
he
thinking
about
manley
you
my
husband
and
once
i
draw
a
bead
on
that
gazabo
on
shore
kent
interrupted
her
faint
faring
up
of
sentiment
toward
the
man
she
had
once
loved
and
loved
no
more
val
drew
a
long
breath
and
turned
the
glasses
reluctantly
from
the
fugitive
i
do
see
him
oh
yes
he
down
beside
a
rock
on
one
knee
and
he
taking
a
rest
across
the
rock
and
is
squinting
along
oh
he
ca
hit
him
at
that
distance
can
he
kent
would
he
dare
why
it
would
be
murder
would
it
shot
kent
reached
up
a
hand
and
took
the
glasses
from
her
eyes
with
a
masterful
gesture
you
let
me
look
he
said
laconically
i
steadier
than
val
crept
closer
to
him
and
looked
up
into
his
face
she
could
read
nothing
there
his
mouth
was
shut
tight
so
that
it
was
a
stern
straight
line
but
that
told
her
nothing
he
always
looked
so
when
he
was
intent
upon
something
or
thinking
deeply
she
turned
her
eyes
toward
the
river
flowing
smoothly
across
the
mouth
of
the
coulee
between
the
land
lay
sleeping
lazily
in
the
hazy
sunlight
of
the
grass
was
brown
the
rocky
outcroppings
of
the
coulee
wall
yellow
and
gray
and
red
and
the
river
was
so
blue
and
so
quiet
surely
that
sleepy
coulee
and
that
placid
river
could
not
be
witnessing
a
tragedy
she
turned
her
head
irritated
by
its
very
calmness
her
eyes
dwelt
wistfully
upon
kent
face
what
are
they
doing
now
kent
her
tone
was
hushed
i
ca
exactly
he
mumbled
absently
his
mind
a
mile
away
she
waited
a
moment
can
you
see
manley
this
time
he
did
not
answer
at
all
he
seemed
terribly
far
off
as
if
only
his
shell
of
a
body
remained
with
her
in
the
room
why
do
you
talk
she
wailed
she
waited
until
she
could
endure
no
more
then
reached
up
and
snatched
the
glasses
from
his
eyes
i
ca
help
it
i
shall
go
crazy
standing
here
i
just
got
to
see
she
panted
for
a
moment
he
clung
to
the
glasses
and
stared
down
at
her
you
better
not
sweetheart
he
urged
gently
but
when
she
still
held
fast
he
let
them
go
she
raised
them
hurriedly
to
her
eyes
and
turned
to
the
river
with
a
shrinking
impatience
to
know
the
worst
and
have
it
over
with
so
she
whimpered
complainingly
trying
vainly
to
steady
the
glasses
he
slipped
his
arms
around
her
and
let
her
lean
against
him
she
did
not
even
seem
to
realize
it
just
then
she
had
caught
sight
of
something
and
her
intense
interest
steadied
her
so
that
she
stood
perfectly
still
why
your
horse
she
gasped
michael
he
got
his
feet
straight
up
in
the
air
oh
kent
he
rolling
over
sad
over
i
ca
see
she
held
her
breath
the
glasses
sagged
as
if
they
had
grown
all
at
once
too
heavy
to
hold
i
i
thought
i
saw
she
shivered
and
hid
her
face
upon
one
upflung
arm
kent
caught
up
the
glasses
and
looked
long
at
the
river
unmindful
of
the
girl
sobbing
wildly
beside
him
finally
he
turned
to
her
hesitated
and
then
gathered
her
close
in
his
arms
the
glasses
slid
unheeded
to
the
floor
do
cry
it
better
this
way
though
it
hard
enough
god
his
voice
was
very
gentle
think
how
awful
it
would
have
been
val
if
the
law
had
got
him
do
cry
like
that
such
things
are
happening
every
day
somewhere
he
realized
suddenly
that
this
was
no
way
to
comfort
her
and
stopped
he
patted
her
shoulder
with
a
sense
of
blank
helplessness
he
could
make
love
but
this
was
not
the
time
for
and
since
he
was
denied
that
outlet
for
his
feelings
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
except
that
he
led
her
to
the
couch
and
settled
her
among
the
cushions
so
that
she
would
be
physically
comfortable
at
least
he
turned
restlessly
to
the
window
looked
out
and
then
went
to
the
couch
and
bent
over
her
i
going
out
to
the
gate
i

he

coulee
he
said

girl

little
pal

could
help
he
touched
his
lips
to
her
hair
so
lightly
she
could
not
feel
it
and
left
her
at
the
gate
he
met
not
the
sheriff
who
was
riding
slowly
and
had
just
passed
through
the
field
gate
but
arline
and
hank
rattling
up
in
the
hawley
thank
the
good
lord
he
exclaimed
when
he
helped
her
from
the
rig
i
never
was
so
glad
to
see
anybody
in
my
life
go
on
in
she
in
there
crying
her
heart
out

dead
the
sheriff
shot
him
in
the
river
oh

been
hell
to
pay
out
here
my
heavens
above
arline
stared
up
at
him
while
she
grasped
the
significance
of
his
words
i
knowed
he
hit
for
here
i
followed
right
out
as
quick
as
hank
could
hitch
up
the
team

about
fred

i
know
all
about

kent
was
guilty
of
pulling
her
through
the
gate
and
then
pushing
her
toward
the
house
you
go
and
do
something
for
that
poor
girl

her
up
and
take
her
to

for
her
out
here
to
kill
a
dozen
he
watched
until
she
had
reached
the
porch
and
then
swung
back
to
hank
sitting
calmly
in
the
buckboard
with
the
lines
gripped
between
his
knees
while
he
filled
his
pipe
i
can
take
care
of
the
man
side
of
this
business
fast
enough
kent
confessed
whimsically
but
there
some
things
it
takes
a
woman
to
he
glanced
again
over
his
shoulder
gave
a
huge
sigh
of
relief
when
he
glimpsed
arline
thin
face
as
she
passed
the
window
and
knelt
beside
the
couch
and
turned
with
a
lighter
heart
to
meet
the
sheriff
