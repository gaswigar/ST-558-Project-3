the
created
legend
by
feodor
sologub
authorized
translation
from
the
russian
by
john
cournos
introduction
for
there
is
nothing
either
good
or
bad
but
thinking
makes
it
shakespeare
to
the
impure
all
things
are
nietzsche
the
little
demon
sologub
has
shown
us
how
the
evil
within
us
peering
out
through
our
imagination
makes
all
the
world
seem
evil
to
us
in
the
created
legend
feeling
perhaps
the
need
of
reacting
from
his
morose
creation
peredonov
the
author
has
set
himself
the
task
of
showing
the
reverse
of
the
picture
how
the
imagination
no
longer
warped
but
sensitized
with
beauty
is
capable
of
creating
a
world
of
its
own
legendary
yet
none
the
less
real
for
the
russian
title
of
the
book
is
more
descriptive
of
the
author
s
intentions
than
an
english
translation
will
permit
it
to
be
tvorimaya
legenda
actually
means
the
legend
in
the
course
of
the
legend
that
sologub
has
in
mind
is
the
active
eternally
changing
process
of
life
orderly
and
structural
in
spite
of
the
external
confusion
the
author
makes
an
effort
to
bring
order
out
of
apparent
chaos
by
stripping
life
of
its
complex
modern
detail
and
reducing
it
to
a
few
significant
symbols
as
in
a
rather
more
subtle
morality
the
modern
novel
is
perhaps
eternal
truths
and
eternal
passions
are
perhaps
too
often
lost
sight
of
under
the
mass
of
unnecessary
naturalistic
this
novel
life
passes
by
the
author
as
a
kind
of
dream
a
dream
within
that
nightmare
reality
a
legend
within
that
amorphousness
called
life
and
the
nightmare
and
the
dream
like
a
sensitive
individual
s
ideas
of
the
world
as
it
is
and
as
it
ought
to
be
alternate
here
like
moods
the
author
has
expressed
this
changeableness
of
mood
curiously
by
alternating
a
crudely
realistic
deliberately
na√Øve
sometimes
journalese
style
with
an
extremely
decorative
lyrical
manner
this
taxing
the
translator
to
the
utmost
in
view
of
the
urgency
to
translate
the
mood
as
well
as
the
a
background
we
have
the
abortive
revolution
novel
is
an
emotional
statement
of
those
nightmarish
days
against
this
rather
hazy
tempestuous
background
we
have
the
sharply
outlined
portrait
of
an
individual
a
poet
containing
a
world
within
himself
a
more
radiant
and
orderly
world
than
the
one
which
his
eyes
look
upon
outwardly
it
is
this
inner
vision
which
permits
him
to
see
the
legend
in
the
outer
chaos
and
we
read
in
this
book
of
his
efforts
to
disentangle
the
thread
of
this
legend
by
the
establishment
of
a
kind
of
hellenic
is
not
alone
the
poet
who
is
capable
of
creating
his
legend
but
any
one
who
refuses
to
be
subject
to
the
whims
of
fate
and
to
serve
the
goddess
of
chance
and
chaos
the
prodigal
scatterer
of
episodes
aisa
the
tragic
thing
about
this
philosophy
as
one
russian
critic
points
out
is
that
even
the
definite
settling
of
the
question
does
not
assure
one
complete
consolation
for
like
ivan
karamazov
in
dostoyevsky
s
brothers
karamazov
one
may
say
i
do
not
accept
god
i
do
not
accept
the
world
created
by
him
god
s
world
i
simply
return
him
the
ticket
most
still
it
is
with
some
such
definite
decision
that
he
enters
the
kingdom
of
ananke
the
goddess
of
necessity
readers
of
the
little
demon
have
seen
a
practical
illustration
of
the
two
forces
in
peredonov
and
liudmilla
peredonov
was
petty
and
pitiful
a
little
demon
nevertheless
he
too
strove
towards
the
truth
in
common
with
all
conscious
life
and
this
striving
tormented
him
he
himself
did
not
understand
that
he
like
all
men
was
striving
towards
the
truth
and
that
was
why
he
had
that
confused
unrest
he
could
not
find
his
truth
and
he
became
entangled
and
was
liudmilla
however
had
saved
herself
from
the
pettiness
and
provinciality
of
this
unclean
impotent
earth
by
creating
a
new
world
for
herself
she
at
any
rate
had
her
beautiful
legend
knew
her
truth
elisaveta
of
the
created
legend
also
belongs
to
the
kingdom
of
ananke
she
finds
her
salvation
in
the
dream
of
liberation
the
dream
dreamt
by
all
good
russians
and
made
an
active
creative
legend
by
the
efforts
to
realize
it
in
life
being
an
antithesis
to
the
analytical
novel
this
novel
treats
of
sex
not
as
a
psychology
but
as
a
philosophy
nuances
are
avoided
the
feminine
figure
becomes
a
symbol
drawn
not
photographically
but
broadly
in
fluent
even
exaggerated
botticellian
outlines
i
might
go
even
further
and
say
that
as
a
symbol
of
russian
revolution
the
figure
of
elisaveta
is
perhaps
meant
to
stand
out
with
the
statuesque
boldness
of
the
victory
of
samothrace
the
feminine
figure
nude
or
thinly
draped
has
been
used
as
symbol
for
ideas
in
the
plastic
arts
ever
since
art
was
born
our
puritans
have
never
been
faced
with
the
problem
of
what
some
of
the
mythological
divinities
in
stone
would
do
if
they
should
suddenly
come
to
life
become
human
yet
it
is
a
problem
of
this
sort
that
sologub
has
attempted
to
solve
the
problem
of
the
gods
in
exile
as
for
elisaveta
sologub
goes
indeed
the
length
of
describing
her
previous
existence
in
the
second
of
the
series
of
novels
that
go
under
the
general
head
of
the
created
legend
she
was
then
the
queen
ortruda
of
some
beautiful
isles
in
the
mediterranean
and
she
is
fated
to
carry
her
queenliness
into
her
later
the
little
demon
is
sologub
s
inferno
the
created
legend
his
and
just
as
the
problem
there
was
the
abuse
of
bodily
beauty
so
it
is
here
the
idealism
of
bodily
beauty
it
is
natural
that
the
of
our
bodies
the
supposed
symbol
of
our
modesty
but
in
reality
an
evidence
of
our
lust
should
form
part
of
his
thesis
but
anatole
france
has
already
pointed
out
brilliantly
in
penguin
island
how
immodesty
originated
in
the
invention
of
conclusion
is
quite
clear
it
is
beauty
that
can
save
the
world
it
is
our
eyes
and
our
imaginations
behind
our
eyes
that
can
remodel
the
world
into
a
chaste
like
don
quixote
whom
sologub
loves
we
must
see
dulcinea
in
our
aldonza
and
our
persistent
thought
of
her
as
dulcinea
may
make
her
dulcinea
in
are
the
thoughts
behind
this
strange
book
in
which
fantasy
and
reality
rub
unfriendly
shoulders
but
it
would
be
robbing
the
reader
of
his
prerogative
to
explain
the
various
symbols
the
author
employs
for
this
is
in
the
full
sense
a
symbolist
novel
and
like
a
piece
of
music
or
a
picture
in
patterns
its
charm
to
him
who
will
like
it
will
lie
in
individual
interpretation
i
can
not
however
resist
the
desire
to
speak
of
my
own
personal
preference
for
chapter
xiii
in
which
the
death
of
certain
musty
russian
institutions
is
brilliantly
symbolized
by
the
author
in
the
passage
of
the
risen
dead
on
john
s
the
quiet
children
the
author
has
resurrected
as
it
were
the
child
heroes
in
which
his
stories
abound
and
given
them
an
existence
on
a
new
plane
beyond
good
and
it
is
only
children
beings
chaste
and
impressionable
who
are
capable
of
transformation
or
shall
we
say
transfiguration
and
if
they
happen
to
be
in
this
case
more
paradisian
than
earthly
it
is
because
truth
expressed
in
symbols
must
of
necessity
appear
fantastic
and
exaggerated
it
is
for
the
same
reason
that
we
find
the
worthlessness
of
matov
expressed
in
his
being
turned
by
trirodov
into
a
then
there
is
the
sun
the
flaming
dragon
the
infuriator
of
men
s
passions
powerless
however
to
affect
the
quiet
children
who
freed
of
all
passion
the
beast
in
man
may
have
their
white
feet
covered
with
the
light
dust
of
the
earth
but
never
scorched
by
the
evil
various
references
to
the
art
and
ideas
of
the
poet
trirodov
and
to
the
poet
s
tardy
recognition
are
certain
to
be
recognized
as
must
add
that
in
the
original
this
first
of
created
legend
novels
is
called
drops
of
blood
a
phrase
which
recurs
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
in
connexion
with
the
problem
of
cruelty
in
john
cournos
chapter
i
i
take
a
piece
of
life
coarse
and
poor
and
create
from
it
a
delightful
legend
because
i
am
a
poet
whether
it
linger
in
the
darkness
whether
it
be
dim
commonplace
or
raging
with
a
furious
fire
life
is
before
you
i
a
poet
will
erect
the
legend
i
have
created
about
the
enchanting
and
the
beautiful
chance
caught
in
the
entangling
net
of
circumstance
brings
about
every
beginning
yet
it
is
better
to
begin
with
what
is
splendid
in
earthly
experience
or
at
any
rate
with
what
is
beautiful
and
pleasing
splendid
are
the
body
the
youth
and
the
gaiety
in
man
splendid
are
the
water
the
light
and
the
summer
in
nature
it
was
a
bright
hot
midday
in
summer
and
the
heavy
glances
of
the
flaming
dragon
fell
on
the
river
skorodyen
the
water
the
light
and
the
summer
beamed
and
were
glad
they
beamed
because
of
the
sunlight
that
filled
the
immense
space
they
were
glad
because
of
the
wind
that
blew
from
some
far
land
because
of
the
many
birds
because
of
the
two
nude
maidens
two
sisters
elisaveta
and
elena
were
bathing
in
the
river
skorodyen
and
the
sun
and
the
water
were
gay
because
the
two
maidens
were
beautiful
and
were
naked
and
the
two
girls
felt
also
gay
and
cool
and
they
wanted
to
scamper
and
to
laugh
to
chatter
and
to
jest
they
were
talking
about
a
man
who
had
aroused
their
curiosity
they
were
the
daughters
of
a
rich
proprietor
the
place
where
they
bathed
adjoined
the
spacious
old
garden
of
their
estate
perhaps
they
enjoyed
their
bathing
because
they
felt
themselves
the
mistresses
of
these
waters
and
of
the
under
their
agile
feet
and
they
swam
about
and
laughed
in
this
river
with
the
assurance
and
freedom
of
princesses
born
to
rule
few
know
the
boundaries
of
their
kingdom
but
fortunate
are
they
who
know
what
they
possess
and
exercise
their
sway
they
swam
up
and
down
and
across
the
river
and
tried
to
outswim
and
outdive
one
another
their
bodies
immersed
in
the
water
would
have
presented
an
entrancing
sight
to
any
one
who
might
have
looked
down
upon
them
from
the
bench
in
the
garden
on
the
high
bank
and
watched
the
exquisite
play
of
their
muscles
under
their
thin
elastic
skin
pink
tones
lost
themselves
in
the
pearl
of
their
bodies
but
pink
triumphed
in
their
faces
and
in
those
parts
of
the
body
most
often
exposed
the
opposite
rose
in
a
slope
there
were
bushes
here
behind
them
for
a
great
distance
stretched
fields
of
rye
while
just
over
the
edge
where
the
earth
and
the
sky
met
were
visible
the
far
huts
of
the
suburban
village
peasant
boys
passed
by
on
the
bank
they
did
not
look
at
the
bathing
women
but
a
schoolboy
who
had
come
a
long
way
from
the
other
end
of
the
town
sat
on
his
heels
behind
the
bushes
he
called
himself
an
ass
because
he
had
not
brought
his
camera
but
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
i
ll
surely
bring
the
schoolboy
quickly
looked
at
his
watch
in
order
to
make
a
note
of
the
time
the
girls
went
out
bathing
he
knew
them
and
often
came
to
their
house
to
see
his
friend
their
relative
elena
the
younger
now
appealed
most
to
him
she
was
plump
cheerful
white
rosy
her
hands
and
feet
were
small
he
did
not
like
the
hands
and
feet
of
the
elder
sister
elisaveta
they
seemed
to
him
to
be
too
large
and
too
red
her
face
also
was
red
very
sunburnt
and
she
was
altogether
quite
large
oh
well
he
reflected
she
is
certainly
well
formed
you
can
t
deny
her
about
a
year
had
now
passed
since
the
retired
giorgiy
sergeyevitch
trirodov
a
doctor
of
chemistry
had
settled
in
the
town
of
skorodozh
from
the
very
first
he
had
caused
much
talk
in
the
town
mostly
unsympathetic
it
was
quite
natural
that
the
two
girls
in
the
water
should
also
talk
of
him
they
splashed
about
gaily
and
as
they
raised
spray
with
their
feet
they
kept
up
a
conversation
how
puzzling
it
all
is
said
elena
the
younger
sister
no
one
knows
where
his
income
comes
from
what
he
does
in
his
house
and
why
he
has
this
colony
of
children
there
are
all
sorts
of
strange
rumours
about
him
it
s
certainly
a
elena
s
words
reminded
elisaveta
of
an
article
she
had
read
lately
in
a
philosophic
periodical
published
at
moscow
elisaveta
had
a
good
memory
she
recalled
a
phrase
in
our
world
reason
will
never
dominate
and
the
mysterious
will
always
maintain
its
she
tried
to
recall
more
but
suddenly
realizing
that
it
would
not
interest
elena
she
gave
a
sigh
and
grew
silent
elena
gave
her
a
tender
appealing
look
and
said
when
it
is
so
bright
you
want
everything
to
be
as
clear
as
it
is
around
us
is
everything
really
clear
now
exclaimed
elisaveta
the
sun
blinds
your
eyes
the
water
flashes
and
dazzles
and
in
this
ragingly
bright
world
we
do
not
even
know
whether
there
isn
t
some
one
a
couple
of
paces
away
peeping
at
at
this
moment
the
sisters
were
standing
in
the
water
near
the
overgrown
bank
the
schoolboy
who
sat
on
his
heels
behind
the
bush
heard
elisaveta
s
words
he
grew
cold
in
his
confusion
and
began
to
crawl
on
between
the
bushes
away
from
the
river
he
got
in
among
the
rye
then
perched
himself
on
the
and
pretended
to
rest
as
though
he
were
not
even
aware
of
the
closeness
of
the
river
but
no
one
had
noticed
him
as
if
he
were
the
schoolboy
sat
there
a
little
while
then
went
home
with
a
vague
feeling
of
disenchantment
injury
and
irritation
there
was
something
especially
humiliating
to
him
in
the
thought
that
to
the
two
girl
bathers
he
was
merely
a
possibility
speculated
upon
but
actually
everything
in
this
world
has
an
end
there
was
an
end
also
to
the
sisters
bathing
they
made
their
way
silently
together
out
of
the
pleasant
cool
deep
water
towards
the
dry
ground
heaven
s
terrestrial
footstool
and
out
into
the
air
where
they
met
the
hot
kisses
of
the
slowly
cumbrously
rising
dragon
they
stood
a
while
on
the
bank
yielding
themselves
to
the
dragon
s
kisses
then
entered
the
protected
where
they
had
left
their
clothes
elisaveta
s
clothes
were
very
simple
they
consisted
of
a
greenish
yellow
not
without
sleeves
and
a
plain
straw
hat
elisaveta
nearly
always
wore
yellow
dresses
she
loved
yellow
she
loved
buttercups
and
gold
and
though
she
sometimes
said
that
she
wore
yellow
in
order
to
soften
her
ruddy
complexion
she
really
loved
it
simply
sincerely
and
for
its
own
sake
yellow
delighted
elisaveta
there
was
something
remote
and
unpremeditated
in
this
as
if
it
were
a
thing
remembered
from
another
previous
life
elisaveta
s
heavy
black
braid
of
hair
was
coiled
tightly
and
attractively
around
her
head
and
as
it
was
lifted
quite
high
at
the
back
her
neck
showed
sunburnt
and
gracefully
erect
elisaveta
s
face
had
a
keen
almost
exaggerated
expression
of
the
mastery
of
will
and
intellect
over
the
emotions
the
long
and
peculiarly
straight
parting
of
her
lips
was
very
exquisite
her
blue
eyes
were
cheerful
even
when
her
lips
did
not
smile
their
glance
was
thoughtful
and
gentle
the
bright
ruddiness
and
strong
tan
of
the
face
seemed
strangely
alien
to
it
while
waiting
for
elena
to
finish
dressing
elisaveta
walked
slowly
on
the
sandy
bank
and
looked
into
the
monotonous
distances
the
fine
warm
grains
of
sand
gently
warmed
her
bare
feet
which
had
grown
cold
in
the
water
elena
dressed
slowly
she
enjoyed
dressing
everything
that
she
put
on
seemed
an
adornment
to
her
she
delighted
in
the
rosy
reflections
of
her

in
her
pretty
light
dress

a
pinkish
white
material
in
her
broad
sash
of
pink
silk
fastened
behind
with
a
buckle

her
straw
hat
trimmed
with
bright
pink
ribbons
on
top
and
velvet
on
its
underbrim
at
last
elena
was
dressed
the
sisters
climbed
the
sloping
bank
and
went
where
their
curiosity
drew
them
they
loved
to
take
long
walks
they
had
already
passed
several
times
the
house
and
grounds
of
giorgiy
trirodov
whom
they
had
not
yet
seen
once
they
wished
to
go
that
way
again
and
to
try
and
see
what
was
to
be
seen
the
sisters
walked
two
versts
through
the
wood
they
spoke
quietly
of
various
things
and
felt
a
little
agitated
curiosity
often
agitates
people
the
sinuous
road
with
two
revealed
picturesque
views
at
every
turn
the
path
finally
chosen
by
the
sisters
led
to
a
hollow
its
sides
overgrown
with
bushes
and
weeds
looked
wildly
beautiful
from
its
depth
came
the
sweet
warm
odour
of
clover
and
down
below
its
white
bosom
grass
was
visible
a
small
narrow
bridge
propped
up
from
below
with
thin
slender
stakes
hung
over
the
hollow
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
a
low
hedge
stretched
right
and
left
and
in
this
hedge
quite
facing
the
bridge
a
small
gate
was
visible
the
sisters
crossed
the
bridge
holding
on
to
its
slender
of
birch
they
tried
the
gate
it
was
closed
they
looked
at
one
another
elisaveta
growing
red
with
vexation
said
we
ll
have
to
go
back
every
one
says
that
you
can
t
get
into
the
place
said
elena
that
you
ve
got
to
get
over
the
hedge
and
that
even
that
is
impossible
for
some
reason
or
other
it
s
very
strange
i
wonder
what
they
can
be
up
to
suddenly
there
was
a
slight
rustle
in
the
bushes
by
the
hedge
the
branches
parted
a
pale
boy
ran
up
to
them
he
looked
quickly
at
the
sisters
with
his
clear
intensely
calm
almost
dead
eyes
there
was
something
strange
in
the
shape
of
his
pale
lips
thought
elisaveta
a
motionless
sorrowful
expression
lurked
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
he
opened
the
gate
he
seemed
to
say
something
but
so
quietly
that
the
sisters
could
not
catch
his
words
or
was
it
the
sound
of
the
light
breeze
in
the
wavering
foliage
the
boy
hid
himself
behind
the
bushes
so
quickly
that
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
he
had
been
there
at
all
the
sisters
had
no
time
to
be
astonished
or
to
thank
him
it
was
as
if
the
gate
had
opened
by
itself
or
had
been
pushed
open
by
one
of
the
sisters
by
chance
they
stood
there
undecided
an
incomprehensible
unrest
took
possession
of
them
for
an
instant
and
as
quickly
went
from
them
curiosity
again
dominated
them
the
sisters
entered
how
did
he
open
it
asked
elena
elisaveta
without
a
word
went
quickly
forward
she
was
so
elated
at
getting
in
that
she
had
almost
forgotten
the
pale
boy
only
somewhere
within
the
domain
of
vague
consciousness
there
gleamed
dimly
a
strange
white
face
the
wood
was
quite
like
the
one
by
which
they
had
come
to
the
gate
quite
as
pensive
and
as
tall
and
as
isolated
from
the
sky
and
as
absorbed
in
its
own
mysteries
but
here
it
seemed
to
have
been
conquered
by
human
activity
not
far
away
voices
cries
laughter
resounded
here
and
there
were
evidences
of
games
the
narrow
footpaths
often
led
to
wider
paths
of
sand
the
sisters
quickly
followed
the
winding
path
in
the
direction
from
which
the
children
s
voices
sounded
loudest
afterwards
all
this
jumble
of
sound
seemed
to
collapse
and
it
renewed
itself
in
loud
sweet
singing
at
last
there
appeared
before
them
a
small
glade
oval
in
shape
tall
firs
edged
this
open
space
as
evenly
as
graceful
columns
in
a
magnificent
the
blue
of
the
sky
above
it
seemed
especially
bright
pure
and
dominant
the
glade
was
full
of
children
of
various
ages
they
were
sitting
and
reclining
all
around
in
ones
twos
and
threes
in
the
middle
some
thirty
boys
and
girls
were
singing
and
dancing
their
dance
followed
strictly
the
rhythm
of
the
tune
and
interpreted
the
words
of
the
song
with
beautiful
fidelity
they
were
directed
by
a
tall
graceful
girl
who
had
a
strong
sonorous
voice
braids
of
magnificent
golden
hair
and
grey
cheerful
eyes
all
of
them
the
children
as
well
as
their
instructresses
of
whom
three
or
four
were
to
be
seen
were
dressed
quite
simply
and
alike
their
simple
light
attire
seemed
beautiful
it
was
pleasant
to
look
at
them
perhaps
because
their
dress
revealed
the
active
parts
of
their
body
the
arms
and
the
legs
dress
here
was
made
to
protect
and
not
to
conceal
to
clothe
and
not
to
muffle
the
blue
and
red
of
the
hats
and
of
the
dresses
gave
emphasis
to
the
vivid
tones
of
the
faces
and
of
the
arms
and
legs
there
was
a
spirit
of
gaiety
here
a
sense
of
holiday
splendour
in
these
naturally
adorned
bodies
boldly
revealed
under
clear
azure
skies
some
of
the
children
from
among
those
who
did
not
sing
approached
the
sisters
and
looked
at
them
in
a
friendly
manner
smiling
trustfully
you
may
sit
down
if
you
like
said
a
boy
with
very
blue
eyes
here
is
a
thank
you
my
dear
said
elisaveta
the
sisters
sat
down
the
children
wished
to
talk
to
them
one
little
girl
said
i
ve
just
seen
a
little
squirrel
it
was
sitting
on
a
pine
then
i
gave
a
shout
you
should
have
seen
it
run
the
others
also
began
to
talk
and
to
ask
questions
the
singers
ended
their
song
and
scattered
in
all
directions
to
play
the
instructress
went
up
to
the
sisters
and
asked
have
you
come
from
town
are
you
pleased
with
what
you
have
seen
here
yes
it
s
splendid
here
said
elisaveta
our
place
adjoins
this
we
are
the
rameyevs
i
am
elisaveta
and
this
is
my
sister
the
girl
suddenly
blushed
as
if
she
felt
ashamed
that
the
wealthy
young
women
were
looking
at
her
naked
shoulders
and
at
her
legs
naked
to
the
knee
but
seeing
that
they
too
were
barefoot
and
wore
short
skirts
she
quickly
recovered
and
smiled
at
them
my
name
is
nadezhda
vestchezerova
she
said
she
looked
attentively
at
the
sisters
elisaveta
thought
that
she
had
heard
the
name
somewhere
in
town
perhaps
a
tale
in
connexion
with
it
she
could
not
remember
exactly
what
for
some
reason
she
did
not
mention
this
to
nadezhda
perhaps
it
was
a
tragic
history
this
fear
of
talking
about
the
past
occasionally
came
upon
elisaveta
who
knows
what
sorrow
is
hid
behind
a
bright
smile
and
from
what
darkness
has
sprung
the
blossoming
which
gives
sudden
joy
to
a
glance
elusively
beautiful
and
born
of
unhappy
worldly
experience
did
you
find
your
way
in
easily
asked
the
nadezhda
with
a
friendly
but
subtle
smile
it
s
usually
not
a
simple
matter
she
explained
elisaveta
replied
a
white
boy
opened
the
gate
for
us
he
ran
off
so
quickly
that
we
had
not
even
the
time
to
thank
nadezhda
suddenly
ceased
smiling
oh
yes
he
isn
t
one
of
us
she
said
falteringly
they
live
over
there
with
trirodov
there
are
several
of
them
wouldn
t
you
like
to
have
lunch
with
us
she
asked
cutting
short
her
previous
remarks
elisaveta
suspected
that
nadezhda
wanted
to
change
the
subject
we
live
here
all
day
long
we
eat
here
we
learn
here
and
we
play
here
do
everything
here
said
nadezhda
people
have
built
cities
to
escape
the
wild
beast
but
they
themselves
have
become
like
wild
beasts
like
a
bitter
note
crept
into
her
voice
was
it
the
echo
of
her
past
life
or
was
it
a
thing
foreign
to
her
and
grafted
upon
her
sensitive
nature
she
continued
we
have
come
from
the
town
into
the
woods
from
the
wild
beast
from
the
savages
of
the
town
the
beast
must
be
killed
the
wolf
and
the
fox
and
the
hawk
all
those
who
prey
upon
others
they
must
be
elisaveta
asked
how
is
one
to
kill
a
beast
who
has
grown
iron
and
steel
nails
and
who
has
built
his
lair
in
the
town
it
is
he
who
does
the
killing
and
there
s
no
end
in
sight
to
his
nadezhda
knitted
her
eyebrows
pressed
her
hands
and
stubbornly
repeated
we
shall
kill
him
we
shall
kill
chapter
ii
the
sisters
stayed
to
lunch
they
remained
over
an
hour
chattering
cheerfully
with
the
children
and
their
instructresses
the
children
were
sweet
and
confiding
the
instructresses
no
less
simple
and
charming
seemed
cheerful
and
restful
yet
they
were
always
busy
and
nothing
escaped
them
besides
many
of
the
children
did
certain
things
without
being
urged
this
being
evidently
a
part
of
a
system
of
which
the
sisters
had
as
yet
barely
an
inkling
instruction
was
mixed
up
with
play
one
of
the
instructresses
invited
the
sisters
to
listen
to
what
she
called
her
lesson
the
sisters
listened
with
enjoyment
to
an
interesting
discourse
concerning
the
objects
the
children
had
observed
that
day
in
the
wood
there
were
other
instructresses
who
had
just
returned
from
the
depths
of
the
wood
some
children
were
going
into
the
wood
others
were
coming
out
quite
different
ones
the
instructress
to
whom
the
sisters
were
listening
ended
her
discourse
and
suddenly
scampered
off
somewhere
through
the
dark
foliage
of
the
trees
could
be
seen
the
glimmer
of
red
caps
and
of
sunburnt
arms
and
legs
the
sisters
were
again
left
alone
no
one
paid
especial
attention
to
them
any
longer
evidently
there
was
no
one
they
either
embarrassed
or
hindered
it
s
time
to
go
said
elena
elisaveta
made
a
move
yes
let
s
go
she
agreed
it
s
very
interesting
and
delightful
here
but
we
can
t
stay
for
the
departure
of
the
sisters
had
been
noticed
a
few
of
the
children
ran
up
to
them
the
children
cried
gaily
we
will
show
you
the
way
or
you
ll
get
when
the
sisters
paused
at
the
gate
elisaveta
thought
that
some
one
was
looking
at
her
out
of
a
with
a
gaze
of
astonishment
in
perplexity
strange
and
distressing
she
looked
around
her
behind
the
hedge
in
the
bushes
a
small
boy
and
a
small
girl
were
hiding
they
were
like
the
others
she
had
seen
here
except
that
they
were
very
white
as
though
the
kisses
of
the
stern
dragon
floating
in
the
hot
sky
had
left
no
traces
upon
their
tender
skin
both
the
little
boy
and
the
little
girl
were
staring
with
a
motionless
but
attentive
gaze
their
chaste
look
seemed
to
penetrate
into
the
very
depth
of
one
s
soul
this
rather
disconcerted
elisaveta
she
whispered
to
elena
look
what
strange
beings
elena
looked
in
the
direction
of
elisaveta
s
glance
and
said
indifferently
monsters
elisaveta
was
astonished
at
her
sister
s
observation
the
faces
of
these
hiding
children
seemed
to
her
like
the
faces
of
praying
angels
by
this
time
the
children
who
had
escorted
the
sisters
ran
back
jostling
each
other
and
laughing
only
one
boy
remained
with
them
he
opened
the
gate
and
waited
for
the
sisters
to
go
out
so
that
he
could
shut
it
again
elisaveta
quietly
asked
him
who
are
these
with
a
light
movement
of
her
head
she
indicated
the
bushes
where
the
boy
and
the
girl
were
hiding
the
cheerful
urchin
looked
in
the
direction
of
her
glance
then
at
her
and
said
there
s
no
one
and
actually
no
one
was
now
visible
in
the
bushes
elisaveta
persisted
but
i
did
see
a
boy
and
a
girl
there
both
were
quite
white
not
at
all
brown
like
the
rest
of
you
they
stood
ever
so
quietly
and
the
cheery
lad
looked
attentively
at
elisaveta
frowned
slightly
lowered
his
eyes
reflected
then
again
eyed
the
sisters
attentively
and
sadly
and
said
in
the
main
building
where
giorgiy
sergeyevitch
lives
there
are
more
of
these
quiet
children
they
are
never
with
us
they
are
quiet
ones
they
do
not
play
they
have
been
it
s
likely
they
haven
t
improved
yet
i
don
t
know
they
are
kept
the
boy
said
this
slowly
and
thoughtfully
as
if
he
were
astonished
because
there
in
the
house
of
the
master
were
other
children
quiet
ones
who
did
not
join
in
their
play
suddenly
he
shook
his
head
lustily
banishing
as
it
were
unaccustomed
thoughts
then
took
off
his
cap
and
exclaimed
cheerily
and
with
some
tenderness
a
happy
journey
darlings
follow
this
he
made
an
obeisance
and
ran
off
the
sisters
were
quite
alone
now
they
went
on
in
the
direction
given
them
by
the
boy
a
quiet
vale
opened
up
before
them
and
in
the
distance
a
white
wall
was
visible
which
concealed
trirodov
s
house
they
continued
their
way
towards
the
house
in
front
of
them
keeping
close
to
the
bushes
walked
a
boy
in
a
white
dress
he
appeared
to
be
showing
them
the
way
it
was
very
quiet
high
above
them
protecting
himself
from
the
human
eye
by
dark
purple
shields
the
flaming
dragon
rested
his
look
from
behind
the
deceptive
vacillant
shields
was
hot
and
evil
he
poured
out
his
dazzling
light
tormented
men
with
it
yet
wished
them
to
rejoice
in
his
presence
and
to
compose
hymns
to
him
he
wished
to
rule
and
it
seemed
as
though
he
were
motionless
as
though
he
would
never
decide
to
retire
but
his
livid
weariness
already
began
to
incline
him
westwards
still
his
passion
grew
and
his
kisses
were
scorching
and
his
infuriated
gaze
with
its
livid
purple
dimmed
the
glances
of
the
two
girls
the
girls
glances
were
seeking
seeking
trirodov
s
house
trirodov
s
house
stood
about
a
verst
and
a
half
from
the
edge
of
the
town
not
at
the
end
where
the
dirty
and
smoky
factory
buildings
squatted
but
quite
at
the
other
end
along
the
river
skorodyen
above
the
town
of
skorodozh
this
house
and
the
estate
attached
to
it
occupied
a
considerable
space
surrounded
by
a
stone
wall
one
side
of
the
place
faced
the
river
the
other
the
town
the
rest
adjoined
the
fields
and
woods
the
house
stood
in
the
middle
of
an
old
garden
from
behind
the
tall
white
stone
wall
the
tops
of
the
trees
were
to
be
seen
while
between
them
quite
high
two
turrets
of
the
house
one
somewhat
higher
than
the
other
were
visible
the
sisters
felt
as
if
some
one
in
the
high
turret
were
looking
down
upon
them
there
were
ominous
rumours
concerning
the
house
even
in
the
days
when
it
belonged
to
the
previous
tenant
matov
a
kinsman
of
the
rameyev
sisters
it
was
said
that
the
house
was
inhabited
by
ghosts
and
by
phantoms
who
had
left
their
graves
there
was
a
footpath
close
to
the
house
which
led
across
the
northern
part
of
the
estate
through
a
wood
to
the
krutitsk
cemetery
in
the
town
they
called
this
the
footpath
of
navii
and
they
were
afraid
to
walk
upon
it
even
by
day
many
legends
grew
up
around
it
the
local
tried
vainly
to
disprove
them
the
whole
property
was
sometimes
called
navii
s
playground
there
were
some
who
said
that
they
had
seen
with
their
own
eyes
this
enigmatic
inscription
on
the
gates
three
went
in
two
came
this
inscription
was
of
course
no
longer
there
now
only
lightly
figures
were
to
be
seen
one
under
the
other
on
top
lower
and
at
the
bottom
all
the
evil
rumours
and
warnings
did
not
prevent
giorgiy
sergeyevitch
trirodov
from
buying
the
house
he
made
changes
in
it
and
then
settled
here
after
his
comparatively
brief
educational
career
had
been
rudely
cut
short
it
took
a
long
time
to
rebuild
and
transform
the
house
the
high
walls
prevented
any
one
from
seeing
what
was
being
done
there
this
aroused
the
curiosity
of
the
townsfolk
and
caused
all
sorts
of
malicious
gossip
the
working
men
did
not
belong
to
the
place
but
were
brought
from
a
distance
dark
and
short
and
rather
they
did
not
understand
the
local
speech
and
seldom
showed
themselves
in
the
streets
they
are
wicked
and
dark
was
said
about
them
in
the
town
they
carry
knives
about
with
them
and
dig
underground
passages
in
navii
s
playground
he
himself
is
like
a
german
and
he
s
imported
these
foreign
i
like
that
instructress
nadezhda
vestchezerova
said
elena
she
looked
searchingly
at
her
sister
yes
she
s
very
sincere
answered
elisaveta
a
fine
they
are
all
charming
said
elena
with
greater
assurance
yes
observed
elisaveta
with
indecision
in
her
voice
but
there
is
that
other
the
one
that
ran
away
from
us
there
s
something
i
don
t
like
about
her
perhaps
it
s
a
slight
veneer
of
why
do
you
say
so
asked
elena
i
simply
feel
it
she
smiles
too
pleasantly
too
lovingly
she
seems
in
every
way
phlegmatic
yet
she
tries
to
appear
animated
her
words
come
rather
easily
sometimes
and
she
it
was
quiet
in
the
garden
behind
the
stone
wall
this
was
kirsha
s
free
hour
but
he
could
not
play
though
he
tried
to
little
kirsha
trirodov
s
son
whose
mother
had
died
not
long
before
was
dark
and
thin
he
had
a
very
mobile
face
and
restless
dark
eyes
he
was
dressed
like
the
boys
in
the
wood
he
was
quite
restless
he
felt
sad
without
knowing
why
he
felt
as
if
some
invisible
being
were
drawing
him
on
calling
to
him
in
an
inaudible
whisper
demanding
something
what
and
who
was
it
approaching
their
house
why
friend
or
foe
it
was
a
stranger
yet
curiously
intimate
at
that
moment
when
the
sisters
were
taking
leave
of
the
children
in
the
wood
kirsha
felt
especially
perturbed
in
the
far
corner
of
the
garden
he
saw
a
boy
in
white
dress
he
ran
up
to
him
they
spoke
long
and
quietly
then
kirsha
ran
to
his
father
giorgiy
sergeyevitch
trirodov
was
all
alone
at
home
he
was
lying
on
the
sofa
reading
a
book
by
wilde
trirodov
was
forty
years
old
he
was
slender
and
erect
his
hair
and
face
made
him
look
very
young
only
on
closer
scrutiny
it
was
possible
to
detect
the
many
grey
hairs
the
wrinkles
on
the
forehead
around
the
eyes
his
face
was
pale
his
broad
forehead
seemed
very
large
it
was
partly
due
to
a
narrow
chin
lean
cheeks
and
baldness
the
room
where
trirodov
was
reading
his
study
was
large
bright
and
simple
with
a
white
unpainted
floor
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
the
walls
were
lined
with
open
bookcases
in
the
wall
opposite
the
windows
between
the
bookcases
a
narrow
space
was
left
large
enough
for
a
man
to
stand
in
it
gave
the
impression
of
a
door
being
there
hidden
by
hangings
in
the
middle
of
the
room
stood
a
very
large
table
upon
which
lay
books
papers
and
several
strange
objects
hexahedral
prisms
of
an
unfamiliar
substance
heavy
and
solid
in
appearance
dark
red
in
colour
with
purple
blue
grey
and
black
spots
and
with
veins
running
across
it
kirsha
knocked
on
the
door
and
entered
quiet
small
troubled
trirodov
looked
at
him
anxiously
kirsha
said
there
are
two
young
women
in
the
wood
such
an
inquisitive
pair
they
have
been
looking
over
our
colony
now
they
d
like
to
come
here
to
take
a
look
trirodov
let
the
pale
green
ribbon
with
a
lightly
stamped
pattern
fall
upon
the
page
he
was
reading
and
laid
the
book
on
the
small
table
at
his
side
he
then
took
kirsha
by
the
hand
drew
him
close
and
looked
attentively
at
him
with
a
slight
stir
in
his
eyes
then
said
quietly
you
ve
been
asking
questions
of
those
quiet
boys
kirsha
grew
red
but
stood
erect
and
calm
trirodov
continued
to
reproach
him
how
often
have
i
told
you
that
this
is
wicked
it
is
bad
for
you
and
for
it
s
all
the
same
to
them
said
kirsha
quietly
how
do
you
know
asked
trirodov
kirsha
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
obstinately
why
are
they
here
what
are
they
to
us
trirodov
turned
away
then
rose
abruptly
went
to
the
window
and
looked
gloomily
into
the
garden
clearly
something
was
agitating
his
consciousness
something
that
needed
deciding
kirsha
quietly
walked
up
to
him
stepping
softly
upon
the
white
warm
floor
with
his
sunburnt
graceful
feet
high
in
instep
and
with
long
beautiful
toes
he
touched
his
father
on
the
shoulder
quietly
rested
his
sunburnt
hand
there
and
said
you
know
daddy
that
i
seldom
do
this
only
when
i
must
i
felt
very
much
troubled
i
knew
that
something
would
what
will
happen
asked
his
father
i
have
a
feeling
said
kirsha
with
a
pleading
voice
that
you
must
let
them
in
to
us
these
inquisitive
trirodov
looked
very
attentively
at
his
son
and
smiled
kirsha
said
gravely
the
elder
one
is
very
charming
in
some
way
she
is
like
mother
but
the
other
is
also
what
brings
them
here
again
asked
trirodov
they
might
have
waited
until
their
elders
brought
them
kirsha
smiled
sighed
lightly
and
said
thoughtfully
shrugging
his
small
shoulders
all
women
are
curious
what
s
to
be
done
with
them
smiling
now
joyously
now
gravely
trirodov
asked
and
will
mother
not
come
to
us
oh
if
she
only
came
if
only
for
one
little
minute
exclaimed
kirsha
what
are
we
to
do
with
these
girls
asked
trirodov
invite
them
in
show
them
the
house
replied
kirsha
and
the
quiet
children
quietly
asked
trirodov
the
quiet
children
also
like
the
elder
one
answered
kirsha
and
who
are
they
these
girls
asked
trirodov
they
are
our
neighbours
the
rameyevs
said
kirsha
trirodov
smiled
again
and
said
yes
one
can
understand
why
they
are
so
he
frowned
went
to
the
table
put
his
hand
on
one
of
the
dark
heavy
prisms
and
picked
it
up
cautiously
and
again
carefully
put
it
back
in
its
place
saying
at
the
same
time
to
kirsha
go
then
and
meet
them
and
bring
them
kirsha
growing
animated
asked
by
the
door
or
through
the
grotto
yes
bring
them
through
the
dark
passage
kirsha
went
out
trirodov
was
left
alone
he
opened
the
drawer
of
his
took
out
a
strangely
shaped
flagon
of
green
glass
filled
with
a
dark
fluid
and
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
secret
door
at
that
instant
it
opened
quietly
and
easily
a
pale
quiet
boy
entered
and
looked
at
trirodov
with
his
dispassionate
and
innocent
but
understanding
eyes
trirodov
went
up
to
him
a
reproach
was
ripe
on
his
tongue
but
he
could
not
say
it
pity
and
tenderness
clung
to
his
lips
silently
he
gave
the
flagon
to
the
boy
the
boy
went
out
quietly
chapter
iii
the
sisters
entered
a
thicket
the
path
s
many
turnings
made
them
giddy
suddenly
the
turrets
of
the
old
house
vanished
from
sight
everything
around
them
assumed
an
unfamiliar
look
we
seem
to
have
lost
our
way
said
elena
cheerfully
never
fear
we
ll
find
our
way
out
replied
elisaveta
we
are
bound
to
get
at
that
instant
there
came
towards
them
from
among
the
bushes
the
small
sunburnt
handsome
kirsha
his
dark
closely
grown
eyebrows
and
black
wavy
hair
unspoiled
by
headgear
gave
him
the
wild
look
of
a
dear
boy
where
do
you
come
from
asked
elisaveta
kirsha
eyed
the
sisters
with
an
attentive
direct
and
innocent
gaze
he
said
i
am
kirsha
trirodov
follow
this
path
and
you
ll
find
yourselves
where
you
want
to
go
i
ll
go
ahead
of
he
turned
and
walked
on
the
sisters
followed
him
upon
the
narrow
path
between
the
tall
trees
here
and
there
flowers
were
visible
small
white
odorous
flowers
they
emitted
a
strange
pungent
smell
it
made
the
sisters
feel
both
gay
and
languid
kirsha
walked
silently
before
them
at
the
end
of
the
road
loomed
a
mound
overgrown
by
tangled
ugly
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
mound
was
a
rusty
door
which
looked
as
if
it
were
meant
to
hide
some
treasure
kirsha
felt
in
his
pocket
took
out
a
key
and
opened
the
door
it
creaked
unpleasantly
and
breathed
out
cold
dampness
and
fear
a
long
dark
passage
became
discernible
kirsha
pressed
a
spot
near
the
door
the
dark
passage
became
lit
up
as
though
by
electric
light
but
the
lights
themselves
were
not
visible
the
sisters
entered
the
grotto
the
light
poured
from
everywhere
but
the
sources
of
light
remained
a
mystery
the
walls
themselves
seemed
to
radiate
the
light
fell
evenly
and
neither
bright
reflections
nor
shadowy
places
were
to
be
seen
the
sisters
went
on
now
they
were
alone
the
door
closed
behind
them
with
a
grating
sound
kirsha
ran
on
ahead
the
sisters
no
longer
saw
him
the
corridor
was
sinuous
it
was
difficult
to
walk
fast
for
some
unknown
reason
a
kind
of
weight
seemed
to
fetter
their
limbs
the
passage
inclined
slightly
downwards
they
walked
on
like
this
a
long
time
it
grew
hotter
and
damper
the
farther
they
advanced
there
was
an
aroma
strange
sad
and
exotic
the
fragrance
increased
became
more
and
more
languorous
it
made
the
head
dizzy
and
the
heart
ready
to
faint
with
a
sweetness
not
free
from
pain
it
seemed
an
incredibly
long
way
their
legs
now
moved
more
slowly
the
stone
floor
was
cruelly
hard
it
s
almost
impossible
to
walk
whispered
elisaveta
those
few
moments
seemed
like
ages
in
that
dank
sultry
underground
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
the
narrow
winding
passage
the
two
sisters
felt
as
though
they
were
doomed
to
walk
on
and
on
for
ever
and
ever
without
reaching
any
place
the
light
gradually
grew
dimmer
a
thin
mist
rose
before
their
eyes
still
they
walked
on
along
the
cruel
endless
way
suddenly
their
journey
was
done
before
them
was
an
open
door
a
shaft
of
white
exultant
light
came
pouring
in
freedom
s
own
ecstasy
the
door
opened
into
an
immense
greenhouse
strange
muscular
monstrously
green
plants
grew
here
the
air
was
very
humid
very
oppressive
the
glass
walls
intersected
by
iron
bars
let
through
much
light
the
light
was
painfully
pitilessly
dazzling
so
that
everything
appeared
in
a
whirl
before
their
eyes
elena
glanced
at
her
dress
it
struck
her
as
being
grey
worn
out
but
the
bright
light
diverted
her
glances
elsewhere
and
made
her
forget
herself
the
glass
sky
of
the
greenhouse
flung
down
sparks
and
heat
the
cruel
dragon
rejoiced
at
the
earthly
respirations
confined
in
this
prison
of
glass
he
furiously
kissed
his
beloved
poisonous
grasses
it
is
even
more
terrible
here
than
in
the
passage
said
elisaveta
let
s
leave
this
place
no
it
is
pleasant
here
said
elena
with
a
happy
smile
she
was
enjoying
the
pink
and
purple
flowers
which
bloomed
in
a
round
basin
but
elisaveta
walked
rapidly
towards
the
door
leading
to
the
garden
elena
overtook
her
and
grumbled
why
are
you
running
here
is
a
bench
let
s
rest
trirodov
met
them
in
the
garden
just
outside
the
greenhouse
his
manner
of
addressing
them
was
simple
and
direct
i
believe
he
began
that
you
are
interested
in
this
house
and
its
owner
well
if
you
like
i
ll
show
you
a
part
of
my
elena
blushed
elisaveta
calmly
bowed
and
said
yes
we
are
an
inquisitive
pair
this
house
once
belonged
to
a
relative
but
it
was
left
abandoned
it
is
said
that
many
changes
have
been
yes
many
changes
have
been
made
said
trirodov
quietly
but
the
greater
part
remains
as
it
every
one
was
astonished
continued
elisaveta
when
you
decided
to
settle
here
the
reputation
of
the
house
did
not
hinder
trirodov
led
the
sisters
through
the
house
and
the
garden
the
conversation
ran
on
smoothly
the
sisters
embarrassment
was
soon
gone
they
felt
quite
natural
with
trirodov
his
calm
friendly
voice
put
them
wholly
at
ease
they
continued
to
walk
and
to
observe
but
they
felt
conscious
that
another
life
intimate
yet
remote
hovered
round
them
all
the
while
sounds
of
music
came
to
them
at
intervals
sometimes
it
was
the
doleful
tones
of
a
violin
sometimes
the
quiet
plaint
of
a
flute
again
it
was
the
voice
of
some
unseen
singer
which
sang
a
tender
and
restful
song
upon
one
small
lawn
in
the
shade
of
old
trees
whose
foliage
protected
them
from
the
hot
glare
of
the
dragon
making
it
pleasantly
cool
and
pleasantly
dark
there
a
number
of
small
boys
and
girls
dressed
in
white
had
formed
a
ring
and
were
dancing
as
the
sisters
approached
them
the
children
dispersed
they
scampered
off
so
quietly
that
they
barely
made
a
sound
even
when
they
brushed
against
the
twigs
they
vanished
as
though
they
had
not
been
there
the
sisters
listened
to
trirodov
as
they
walked
pausing
often
to
admire
the
beauties
of
the
garden
its
trees
lawns
ponds
islands
its
quietly
murmuring
fountains
its
picturesque
arbours
its
profusely
gay
they
felt
a
keen
elation
at
having
penetrated
this
mysterious
house
they
were
as
happy
as
schoolgirls
at
the
thought
of
having
infringed
the
commonly
accepted
rules
of
good
society
in
coming
here
as
they
entered
one
room
of
the
house
elena
exclaimed
what
a
strange
room
a
magic
room
said
trirodov
with
a
smile
it
was
indeed
a
strange
room
everything
in
it
had
an
odd
shape
the
ceiling
sloped
the
floor
was
concave
the
corners
were
round
upon
the
walls
were
incomprehensible
pictures
and
unfamiliar
hieroglyphics
in
one
corner
was
a
dark
flat
object
in
a
carved
frame
of
black
wood
it
s
a
mirror
in
which
it
is
interesting
to
take
a
look
at
oneself
said
trirodov
only
you
have
to
stand
in
that
triangle
close
to
the
wall
near
the
the
sisters
went
there
and
glanced
in
the
mirror
two
old
wrinkled
faces
were
reflected
in
it
elena
cried
out
in
fright
elisaveta
growing
pale
turned
towards
her
sister
and
smiled
don
t
be
afraid
she
said
it
s
a
trick
of
some
elena
looked
at
her
and
cried
out
in
horror
you
have
become
quite
old
how
awful
she
ran
from
the
mirror
crying
out
in
her
fright
what
is
it
what
is
it
elisaveta
followed
her
she
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
she
was
agitated
and
tried
to
hide
her
confusion
trirodov
looked
at
them
in
a
manner
he
opened
a
cupboard
inset
in
the
wall
be
calm
he
said
to
elena
i
ll
give
you
some
water
in
a
he
gave
her
a
glass
containing
a
fluid
as
colourless
as
water
elena
quickly
drank
the
water
and
suddenly
felt
cheerful
elisaveta
also
drank
it
elena
threw
herself
towards
the
mirror
i
m
young
again
she
exclaimed
in
a
high
voice
then
she
ran
forward
embraced
elisaveta
and
said
cheerfully
and
you
too
elisaveta
have
grown
an
impetuous
joy
seized
both
sisters
they
caught
each
other
by
the
hands
and
began
to
dance
and
to
twirl
round
the
room
then
they
suddenly
felt
ashamed
they
stopped
and
did
not
know
which
way
to
look
they
laughed
in
their
confusion
elisaveta
said
what
a
stupid
pair
we
are
you
think
us
ridiculous
don
t
you
trirodov
smiled
in
a
friendly
fashion
that
is
the
nature
of
this
place
he
observed
terror
and
joy
live
here
the
sisters
were
shown
many
interesting
things
in
the
house
objects
of
art
and
of
worship
things
which
told
of
distant
lands
and
of
hoary
antiquity
engravings
of
a
strange
and
disturbing
character
variegated
stones
turquoise
pearls
ugly
amorphous
and
grotesque
idols
representations
of
the
there
were
many
of
these
but
only
one
face
profoundly
stirred
elisaveta
elena
enjoyed
the
objects
that
resembled
toys
there
were
many
things
there
that
one
could
play
with
and
thus
indulge
in
a
jumble
of
magic
reflections
of
time
and
space
the
sisters
had
seen
so
much
that
it
seemed
as
if
an
age
had
passed
but
actually
they
had
spent
only
two
hours
here
it
is
impossible
to
measure
time
one
hour
is
an
age
another
is
an
instant
but
humanity
makes
no
distinction
levels
the
hours
down
to
an
average
what
only
two
hours
exclaimed
elena
how
long
we
ve
spent
here
it
s
time
to
go
home
for
do
you
mind
being
a
little
late
asked
trirodov
how
can
we
said
elena
elisaveta
explained
the
hour
of
dinner
is
strictly
kept
in
our
i
ll
have
a
cart
ready
for
the
sisters
thanked
him
but
they
must
start
at
once
they
both
suddenly
felt
sad
and
tired
they
bade
their
host
and
left
him
the
boy
in
white
went
before
them
in
the
garden
and
showed
them
the
way
no
sooner
had
they
again
entered
the
underground
passage
than
they
saw
a
soft
couch
and
a
fatigue
so
poignant
suddenly
overcame
them
that
they
could
not
advance
another
step
let
s
sit
down
said
elena
yes
replied
elisaveta
i
too
am
tired
how
strange
what
a
weariness
the
sisters
sat
down
elisaveta
said
quietly
the
light
that
falls
upon
us
here
from
an
unknown
source
is
not
a
living
light
and
it
is
terrifying
but
the
stern
face
of
the
monster
burning
yet
not
consuming
itself
is
even
more
the
lovely
sun
said
elena
it
will
become
extinguished
said
elisaveta
extinguished
this
unrighteous
luminary
and
in
the
depth
of
subterranean
passages
freed
from
the
scorching
dragon
and
from
cold
that
kills
men
will
erect
a
new
life
full
of
elena
whispered
when
the
earth
grows
cold
men
will
the
earth
will
not
die
answered
elisaveta
no
less
quietly
the
sisters
fell
into
a
sleep
they
did
not
sleep
long
and
when
both
awakened
quite
suddenly
everything
that
had
just
happened
seemed
like
a
dream
they
made
haste
we
must
hurry
home
said
elena
in
an
anxious
voice
they
ran
quickly
the
door
of
the
underground
passage
was
open
just
outside
the
door
in
the
road
stood
a
cart
kirsha
sat
in
it
and
held
the
reins
the
sisters
seated
themselves
elisaveta
took
the
reins
kirsha
spoke
a
word
now
and
then
they
said
little
on
the
way
in
odd
disjointed
words
arrived
at
their
destination
they
got
out
of
the
cart
they
were
in
a
state
kirsha
was
off
before
they
realized
that
they
had
not
thanked
him
when
they
looked
for
him
they
could
only
see
a
cloud
of
dust
and
hear
the
clatter
of
hoofs
and
the
rattle
of
wheels
on
the
cobblestones
chapter
iv
the
sisters
had
barely
time
to
change
for
dinner
they
entered
the
somewhat
weary
and
distraught
they
were
awaited
there
by
their
father
rameyev
the
two
matovs
the
student
piotr
dmitrievitch
and
the
schoolboy
misha
sons
of
rameyev
s
lately
deceased
cousin
to
whom
trirodov
s
estate
had
previously
belonged
the
sisters
spoke
little
at
the
table
and
they
said
nothing
of
their
day
s
adventure
yet
before
this
they
used
to
be
frank
and
loved
to
chat
to
tell
the
things
that
had
happened
to
them
piotr
matov
a
tall
spare
pale
youth
with
sparkling
eyes
who
looked
like
a
man
about
to
enter
a
prophetic
school
seemed
worried
and
irritated
his
nervousness
reflected
itself
in
embarrassed
smiles
and
awkward
movements
in
misha
the
latter
was
a
lad
with
a
quick
merry
eye
but
betraying
his
intense
impressionableness
his
smiling
mouth
trembled
slightly
around
the
corners
apparently
without
cause
the
old
rameyev
who
was
more
robust
than
tall
and
had
the
tranquil
manners
of
a
individual
did
not
betray
his
impatience
at
his
daughters
tardy
appearance
but
took
his
place
at
the
partially
extended
table
which
seemed
small
in
the
middle
of
the
immense
of
dark
embellished
oak
miss
harrison
unembarrassed
began
to
ladle
out
the
soup
she
was
a
plump
calm
slightly
woman
the
personification
of
a
successful
household
rameyev
noticed
that
his
daughters
were
tired
a
vague
alarm
stirred
within
him
but
he
quickly
extinguished
this
tiny
spark
of
displeasure
smiled
tenderly
at
his
daughters
and
said
very
quietly
as
if
cautiously
hinting
at
something
you
have
walked
a
little
too
far
my
there
was
a
short
but
awkward
silence
then
in
order
to
soften
the
hidden
significance
of
his
words
and
to
ease
his
daughters
embarrassment
he
added
i
see
you
don
t
ride
horseback
as
much
as
you
used
after
this
he
turned
to
the
eldest
of
the
brothers
well
petya
have
you
brought
any
news
from
town
the
sisters
felt
uneasy
they
tried
to
take
part
in
the
conversation
this
was
in
those
days
when
the
red
demon
of
murder
was
prowling
in
our
native
land
and
his
terrible
deeds
brought
discord
and
hate
into
the
bosom
of
peaceful
families
the
young
people
in
this
house
as
elsewhere
often
talked
and
wrangled
about
what
had
happened
and
what
was
yet
to
be
for
all
their
wrangling
they
could
not
reach
any
agreement
friendship
from
childhood
and
good
breeding
mitigated
to
some
extent
this
antagonism
of
ideas
but
more
than
once
their
discussions
ended
in
bitter
words
piotr
in
reply
to
rameyev
began
to
tell
about
s
disturbances
and
projected
strikes
irritation
was
evident
in
his
voice
he
was
one
of
those
who
was
intensely
troubled
by
problems
of
a
character
he
thought
that
the
mystical
existence
of
human
unities
might
be
achieved
only
under
the
brilliant
and
alluring
sway
of
caesars
and
popes
he
imagined
that
he
loved
freedom
christian
freedom
yet
all
the
turbulent
movements
of
newly
awakened
life
aroused
only
hate
in
his
heart
there
s
terrible
news
said
piotr
a
general
strike
is
talked
of
it
is
reported
that
all
the
factories
will
shut
down
misha
burst
into
an
unexpected
laugh
it
was
loud
merry
and
childlike
and
there
was
almost
rapture
in
his
remark
but
you
ought
to
see
the
sort
of
face
the
headmaster
makes
on
all
such
his
voice
was
tender
and
sonorous
and
it
rang
so
softly
and
sweetly
that
he
might
have
been
telling
about
the
blessed
and
the
innocent
about
the
chaste
play
on
the
threshold
of
paradisian
abodes
the
words
strike
and
obstruction
came
from
his
lips
like
the
names
of
rare
sweet
morsels
he
grew
cheerful
and
had
a
sudden
desire
to
make
things
lively
in
schoolboy
fashion
he
began
to
sing
loudly
awake
rise
up
but
he
became
confused
stopped
sadly
grew
quiet
and
blushed
the
sisters
laughed
piotr
had
a
surly
look
rameyev
smiled
benignly
miss
harrison
pretending
not
to
have
noticed
the
discordant
incident
calmly
pressed
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
attached
on
a
cord
to
the
hanging
light
to
bring
on
the
next
course
the
dinner
proceeded
slowly
in
the
usual
order
the
discussion
grew
hotter
and
went
from
subject
to
subject
such
is
said
to
be
the
russian
manner
in
argument
perhaps
it
is
the
universal
manner
of
people
when
discussing
something
that
touches
them
deeply
piotr
exclaimed
hotly
why
is
the
autocracy
of
the
proletariat
better
than
the
one
already
in
force
and
what
wild
barbarous
watchwords
they
have
who
is
not
with
us
he
is
against
us
who
is
master
let
him
get
down
from
his
place
it
s
our
it
s
yet
too
early
to
speak
of
our
banquet
said
elena
in
a
restrained
voice
do
you
know
where
we
are
drifting
continued
piotr
there
will
be
a
reign
of
terror
and
a
shaking
up
such
as
russia
has
not
yet
experienced
the
point
at
issue
is
not
that
there
is
talking
or
doing
here
or
there
by
certain
gentry
who
imagine
that
they
are
making
history
the
real
issue
is
in
the
clash
of
two
classes
two
interests
two
cultures
two
conceptions
of
the
world
two
moral
systems
who
is
it
that
wishes
to
seize
the
crown
of
lordship
it
is
the
it
is
he
who
threatens
to
devour
our
elisaveta
said
reproachfully
what
a
word
piotr
smiled
in
a
nervous
and
aggrieved
manner
and
asked
you
don
t
like
it
i
don
t
like
it
said
elisaveta
calmly
with
her
habitual
subjection
to
the
thoughts
and
moods
of
her
elder
sister
elena
said
it
is
a
rude
word
i
feel
a
reminiscence
of
a
once
helpless
serfdom
in
nevertheless
this
word
is
now
sufficiently
literary
said
piotr
with
a
vague
smile
and
why
shouldn
t
one
use
it
it
s
not
the
word
that
matters
we
have
seen
countless
instances
with
our
own
eyes
of
the
progress
of
the
spiritual
bossiak
who
is
savagely
indifferent
to
everything
who
is
hopelessly
wild
malicious
and
drunken
for
generations
to
come
he
will
crush
everything
science
art
everything
a
good
characteristic
specimen
of
a
is
your
stchemilov
with
whom
elisaveta
you
sympathize
so
strongly
he
s
a
familiar
young
fellow
a
handsome
piotr
fixed
his
eyes
on
elisaveta
she
replied
calmly
i
think
you
very
unjust
to
him
he
is
a
good
every
one
was
glad
when
dinner
was
ended
it
was
a
provoking
conversation
even
the
imperturbable
miss
harrison
rose
from
her
place
rather
sooner
than
usual
rameyev
went
to
his
own
room
to
get
his
hour
s
nap
the
young
people
went
into
the
garden
misha
and
elena
ran
downhill
to
the
river
they
had
a
keen
desire
to
run
one
after
the
other
and
to
laugh
elisaveta
called
out
piotr
his
voice
trembled
nervously
elisaveta
paused
she
now
stood
within
the
deep
shadow
of
an
old
linden
she
looked
questioningly
at
piotr
her
graceful
bare
arms
folded
on
her
breast
suddenly
her
heart
beat
faster
what
a
power
of
bewitchment
was
in
those
most
lovable
arms
oh
why
did
not
some
sudden
impulse
of
passion
throw
them
upon
his
shoulders
may
i
speak
a
few
words
to
you
elisaveta
asked
piotr
elisaveta
flushed
a
little
lowered
her
head
and
said
quietly
let
s
sit
down
she
walked
along
the
path
towards
the
small
which
looked
down
the
slope
piotr
followed
her
silently
in
silence
also
they
ascended
the
steep
passage
elisaveta
seated
herself
and
rested
her
arms
upon
the
low
rail
of
the
open
the
undulating
distances
lay
before
her
in
one
broad
panoramic
sweep
a
view
intimate
from
childhood
and
which
never
failed
to
awaken
the
same
delightful
emotion
she
was
looking
no
longer
at
the
separate
objects
nature
poured
herself
out
like
music
before
her
in
an
inexhaustible
play
of
colour
and
of
soothing
sound
piotr
stood
before
her
and
looked
at
her
handsome
face
the
setting
dragon
caressed
elisaveta
s
face
with
its
warm
light
the
skin
thus
suffused
exulted
in
its
radiance
and
bloom
they
were
silent
both
felt
a
painful
awkwardness
piotr
was
nervously
breaking
twigs
from
a
birch
near
by
elisaveta
began
what
is
it
you
wish
to
tell
me
a
cold
remoteness
almost
enmity
sounded
in
her
deeply
agitated
voice
she
felt
her
own
harshness
to
soften
which
she
smiled
gently
and
timidly
what
s
there
to
say
began
piotr
quietly
and
irresolutely
but
one
and
the
same
thing
elisaveta
i
love
you
elisaveta
flushed
her
eyes
gave
a
sudden
flare
then
grew
dull
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
spoke
in
an
agitated
manner
piotr
why
do
you
again
torment
yourself
and
me
needlessly
we
have
been
so
intimate
from
childhood
yet
it
seems
that
we
must
part
our
ways
are
different
we
think
differently
and
believe
piotr
listened
to
her
with
an
expression
of
intense
impatience
and
vexation
elisaveta
wished
to
continue
but
he
interrupted
ah
but
what
s
the
good
of
saying
that
elisaveta
do
i
beg
you
forget
our
differences
they
are
so
petty
or
let
us
admit
that
they
are
significant
what
i
wish
to
say
is
that
politics
and
all
that
separates
us
is
only
a
light
scum
a
momentary
froth
on
the
broad
surface
of
our
life
in
love
there
is
revelation
there
is
eternal
truth
he
who
does
not
love
he
who
does
not
strive
towards
union
with
a
beloved
he
is
i
love
the
people
i
love
freedom
said
elisaveta
quietly
my
love
is
piotr
ignoring
her
words
went
on
you
know
that
i
love
you
i
have
loved
you
a
long
time
my
whole
soul
is
absorbed
as
with
light
with
my
love
for
you
i
am
jealous
and
i
m
not
ashamed
to
tell
you
i
am
jealous
of
your
favour
to
any
one
i
am
even
jealous
of
this
bloused
workman
whose
accomplice
you
would
be
if
he
had
had
the
sufficient
boldness
and
the
brain
to
be
a
conspirator
i
am
jealous
of
the
which
have
captivated
you
and
screen
your
love
of
again
elisaveta
spoke
quietly
you
reproach
me
for
what
is
dear
to
me
for
my
better
part
you
wish
that
i
should
become
different
you
do
not
love
me
you
are
tempted
by
the
beautiful
beast
my
young
body
with
its
smiles
and
its
caresses
and
again
ignoring
what
she
said
piotr
asserted
passionately
elisaveta
dearest
love
me
you
surely
do
not
love
any
one
else
isn
t
that
so
you
do
not
love
any
one
you
have
had
no
time
to
fall
in
love
to
fetter
your
soul
to
any
one
else
s
you
are
as
free
as
man
s
first
bride
you
are
as
superb
as
his
last
wife
you
have
grown
ripe
for
love
for
my
love
you
too
are
thirsty
for
kisses
and
embraces
even
as
o
elisaveta
love
me
love
me
how
can
i
said
elisaveta
elisaveta
if
you
d
only
will
it
exclaimed
piotr
one
must
wish
to
love
if
you
only
understood
how
i
love
you
you
would
love
me
also
my
love
should
fire
in
you
a
responsive
my
friend
you
do
not
love
anything
that
is
mine
answered
elisaveta
you
do
not
love
me
i
don
t
believe
you
forgive
me
i
don
t
understand
your
piotr
frowned
gloomily
and
said
gruffly
you
have
been
fascinated
by
that
false
empty
word
freedom
you
have
never
thought
over
its
true
i
ve
had
little
time
to
think
over
anything
observed
elisaveta
calmly
but
the
feeling
of
freedom
is
the
thing
nearest
to
me
i
can
not
express
it
in
words
i
only
know
that
we
are
fettered
on
this
earth
by
iron
bonds
of
necessity
and
of
circumstance
but
the
nature
of
my
soul
is
freedom
its
fire
is
consuming
the
chains
of
my
material
dependence
i
know
that
we
human
beings
will
always
be
frail
poor
lonely
but
a
time
will
surely
come
when
we
shall
pass
through
the
purifying
flame
of
a
great
conflagration
then
a
new
earth
and
a
new
heaven
shall
open
up
to
us
through
union
we
shall
attain
our
final
freedom
i
know
i
am
saying
all
this
badly
incoherently
i
can
not
say
clearly
what
i
feel
but
let
us
please
say
no
elisaveta
strode
out
of
the
piotr
slowly
followed
her
his
face
was
sad
and
his
eyes
shone
feverishly
but
he
could
not
utter
a
word
inertia
gripped
his
mind
quite
suddenly
he
roused
himself
raised
his
head
smiled
overtook
elisaveta
you
love
me
elisaveta
he
said
with
joyous
assurance
you
love
me
though
you
won
t
admit
it
you
are
not
speaking
the
truth
when
you
say
that
you
don
t
understand
my
love
you
do
know
my
love
you
do
believe
in
it
tell
me
is
it
possible
to
love
so
strongly
and
not
be
loved
in
return
elisaveta
stopped
her
eyes
lit
up
with
a
strange
joy
i
tell
you
once
more
she
said
with
calm
resolution
it
is
not
me
you
love
you
love
the
first
bride
i
am
going
where
i
piotr
stood
there
and
looked
after
her
helpless
pale
dejected
between
the
bushes
a
dress
fluttered
against
the
now
dull
sky
of
a
setting
sun
chapter
v
piotr
and
elisaveta
descended
towards
the
boat

seemed
to
rock
on
the
water
though
there
was
no
breeze
and
the
water
was
smooth
like
a
mirror
a
little
farther
behind
the
bushes
the
canvas
roof
of
the
stood
revealed
elena
misha
and
miss
harrison
were
already
there
they
were
sitting
on
a
bench
halfway
down
the
slope
where
the
path
to
the
landing
was
broken
the
view
from
here
showing
the
bend
of
the
river
was
very
restful
the
water
was
growing
darker
heavier
gradually
assuming
a
leadlike
dullness
misha
and
elena
flushed
with
running
could
not
suppress
their
smiles
the
englishwoman
looked
calmly
at
the
river
and
nothing
shocked
her
in
the
evening
landscape
and
in
the
peaceful
water
but
now
two
persons
came
who
brought
with
them
their
poignant
unrest
their
uneasiness
their
confusion
and
again
an
endless
wrangle
began
they
left
this
bench
from
which
one
could
look
into
such
a
great
distance
and
see
nothing
but
calm
and
peace
everywhere
they
descended
below
to
the
very
bank
even
at
this
close
range
the
water
was
still
and
smooth
and
the
agitated
words
of
the
restless
people
did
not
cause
the
broad
sheet
to
stir
misha
picked
up
thin
flat
stones
and
threw
them
underhand
into
the
distance
so
that
touching
the
water
they
skipped
repeatedly
on
the
surface
he
did
this
habitually
whenever
the
wrangling
distressed
him
his
hands
trembled
the
little
stones
ricochetted
badly
sometimes
this
annoyed
him
but
he
tried
to
hide
his
annoyance
and
to
look
cheerful
elisaveta
said
misha
let
s
see
who
can
throw
the
better
let
s
try
for
they
began
to
play
misha
was
losing
at
the
turn
of
the
river
from
the
direction
of
the
town
a
appeared
piotr
looked
searchingly
into
the
distance
and
said
in
a
vexed
voice
mr
stchemilov
our
intelligent
workman
the
social
democrat
of
the
russia
party
is
again
about
to
honour
elisaveta
smiled
she
asked
with
gentle
reproof
why
do
you
dislike
him
so
no
you
tell
me
exclaimed
piotr
why
this
party
calls
itself
the
russia
party
and
not
the
russian
party
why
this
high
tone
elisaveta
answered
with
her
usual
calm
it
is
called
the
russia
and
not
the
russian
party
because
it
includes
not
only
the
russian
but
also
the
lithuanian
the
armenian
the
jew
and
men
of
other
races
who
happen
to
be
citizens
of
russia
it
seems
to
me
this
is
quite
no
i
do
not
understand
said
piotr
obstinately
i
see
in
it
only
unnecessary
in
the
meantime
the
boat
drew
nearer
two
men
were
sitting
in
it
aleksei
makarovitch
stchemilov
a
young
working
man
a
locksmith
by
trade
sat
at
the
oars
he
was
thin
and
of
medium
height
there
was
a
suggestion
of
irony
in
the
shape
of
his
lips
elisaveta
had
known
stchemilov
since
the
past
autumn
when
she
became
acquainted
with
other
labouring
men
and
party
workmen
the
boat
touched
the
landing
and
stchemilov
sprang
out
gracefully
piotr
remarked
derisively
as
he
bowed
with
exaggerated
politeness
my
homage
to
the
proletariat
of
all
stchemilov
answered
quietly
my
most
humble
respects
to
the
gentleman
he
exchanged
greetings
with
all
then
turning
with
special
deference
towards
elisaveta
said
i
ve
rowed
back
your
property
it
was
almost
taken
from
me
our
suburbanites
have
their
own
conceptions
of
the
divine
rights
of
piotr
boiled
over
with
vexation
the
very
sight
of
this
young
irritated
him
beyond
bounds
he
thought
stchemilov
s
manners
and
speech
arrogant
piotr
said
sharply
as
far
as
i
understand
your
notion
of
things
it
is
not
rights
that
are
holy
but
brute
stchemilov
whistled
and
said
that
is
the
origin
of
all
ownership
you
simply
took
a
thing
and
that
s
all
there
was
to
it
blessed
are
the
strong
is
a
little
adage
among
those
who
have
conquered
and
how
did
you
get
hold
of
this
asked
piotr
with
derision
crumbs
of
wisdom
fall
from
the
tables
of
the
rich
even
to
us
answered
stchemilov
in
a
no
less
contemptuous
tone
we
nourish
ourselves
on
these
small
the
other
young
man
clearly
a
workman
also
remained
in
the
boat
he
looked
rather
timid
lean
and
taciturn
and
had
gleaming
eyes
he
sat
holding
on
to
the
ropes
of
the
rudder
and
was
looking
cautiously
towards
the
bank
stchemilov
looked
at
him
with
amused
tenderness
and
called
to
him
come
here
kiril
don
t
be
afraid
there
are
kindly
people
here
quite
disposed
to
us
in
piotr
grumbled
angrily
under
his
breath
misha
smiled
he
was
eager
to
see
the
though
he
hated
violent
discussions
kiril
got
out
of
the
boat
awkwardly
and
no
less
awkwardly
stood
up
on
the
sand
his
face
averted
he
smiled
to
hide
his
uneasiness
piotr
s
irritation
grew
please
be
seated
he
said
trying
to
assume
a
pleasant
tone
i
ve
done
a
lot
of
sitting
answered
kiril
in
an
artificial
bass
voice
he
continued
to
smile
but
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bench
so
that
he
nearly
fell
over
his
arms
shot
up
into
the
air
and
one
of
his
hands
brushed
against
elisaveta
he
felt
vexed
with
himself
and
he
flushed
as
he
moved
away
from
the
edge
he
remarked
i
ve
sat
two
months
in
administrative
every
one
understood
these
strange
words
piotr
asked
for
what
kiril
seemed
embarrassed
he
answered
with
a
morose
uneasiness
it
s
all
a
very
simple
affair
with
us
you
do
the
slightest
thing
and
they
try
at
once
the
most
murderous
at
this
moment
stchemilov
said
very
quietly
to
elisaveta
not
a
bad
chap
he
wants
to
become
acquainted
with
you
elisaveta
silently
inclined
her
head
smiled
amiably
at
kiril
and
pressed
his
hand
his
face
brightened
rameyev
came
up
to
them
he
greeted
his
visitors
pleasantly
but
coldly
giving
an
impression
of
studied
correctness
the
conversation
continued
somewhat
awkwardly
elisaveta
s
blue
eyes
looked
gently
and
pensively
at
the
irritated
piotr
and
at
his
deliberately
inimical
adversary
stchemilov
piotr
asked
mr
stchemilov
would
you
care
to
explain
to
me
this
talk
of
an
autocracy
by
the
proletariat
you
admit
the
need
of
an
autocracy
but
only
wish
to
shift
it
to
another
centre
in
what
way
is
this
an
improvement
stchemilov
answered
quite
simply
you
masters
and
possessors
do
not
wish
to
give
us
anything
neither
a
fraction
of
an
ounce
of
power
nor
of
possessions
what
s
left
for
us
to
do
what
s
your
immediate
object
put
in
rameyev
immediate
or
ultimate
what
s
that
answered
stchemilov
we
have
only
one
object
the
public
ownership
of
the
machinery
of
what
of
the
land
cried
out
piotr
rather
shrilly
yes
the
land
too
we
consider
as
machinery
of
production
answered
stchemilov
you
imagine
that
there
is
an
infinite
amount
of
land
in
russia
asked
piotr
with
bitter
irony
not
an
infinite
amount
but
certainly
enough
to
go
round
and
plenty
for
every
one
was
stchemilov
s
calm
reply
ten
or
say
a
hundred
acres
per
soul
is
that
what
you
mean
continued
piotr
in
loud
derision
you
ve
got
that
idea
into
the
heads
of
the
muzhiks
and
now
they
re
in
stchemilov
again
whistled
and
said
with
contemptuous
calm
fiddlesticks
the
muzhik
is
not
as
stupid
as
all
that
and
in
any
case
let
me
ask
you
what
hindered
the
opposing
side
from
hammering
the
right
ideas
into
the
muzhik
s
mind
piotr
got
up
angrily
and
strode
away
without
saying
another
word
rameyev
looked
quietly
after
him
and
said
to
stchemilov
piotr
loves
culture
or
more
properly
speaking
civilization
too
well
to
appreciate
freedom
you
insist
too
strongly
on
your
class
interests
and
therefore
freedom
is
no
such
great
lure
to
you
but
we
russian
constitutionalists
are
carrying
on
the
struggle
for
freedom
almost
stchemilov
listened
to
him
and
made
an
effort
to
suppress
an
ironic
smile
it
s
true
he
said
we
won
t
join
hands
with
you
you
wish
to
fly
about
in
the
free
air
while
we
are
still
ravenously
hungry
and
want
to
rameyev
said
after
a
brief
silence
i
am
appalled
at
this
savagery
murders
every
day
every
what
s
there
to
do
asked
stchemilov
persisting
in
his
ironic
tone
i
suppose
you
d
like
to
have
freedom
for
domestic
use
the
sort
you
could
fold
up
and
put
in
your
rameyev
making
no
effort
to
disguise
his
desire
of
closing
the
conversation
rose
smiling
and
stretched
out
his
hand
to
stchemilov
i
must
go
misha
was
about
to
follow
him
but
changed
his
mind
and
ran
towards
the
river
he
found
his
near
the
and
entered
the
water
up
to
his
knees
he
had
long
ago
accustomed
himself
to
go
to
the
river
when
agitated
by
sadness
or
joy
or
when
he
had
to
think
about
something
very
seriously
he
was
a
shy
and
boy
and
loved
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
and
his
dreams
the
coolness
of
the
water
running
fast
about
his
legs
comforted
him
and
banished
evil
moods
as
he
stood
here
with
his
naked
legs
in
the
water
he
became
gentle
and
calm
elena
soon
came
there
also
she
stood
silently
on
the
bank
and
looked
at
the
water
for
some
reason
she
felt
sad
and
wanted
to
cry
the
water
glided
past
her
tranquilly
almost
noiselessly
its
surface
was
smooth
and
thus
it
ran
on
elisaveta
looked
at
stchemilov
with
mild
displeasure
why
are
you
so
sharp
aleksei
she
asked
you
don
t
like
it
comrade
he
asked
in
return
no
i
don
t
like
it
said
elisaveta
in
simple
unmistakable
tones
stchemilov
did
not
reply
at
once
he
grew
thoughtful
then
said
the
abyss
that
separates
us
from
your
cousin
is
too
broad
and
even
between
us
and
your
father
it
is
hard
to
come
together
with
them
their
chief
concern
as
you
very
well
know
is
to
construct
a
pyramid
out
of
people
ours
to
scatter
this
pyramid
in
an
even
stratum
over
the
earth
that
s
how
it
is
elisaveta
showed
her
annoyance
and
corrected
him
how
many
times
have
i
told
you
stchemilov
smiled
a
lordly
caprice
comrade
elisaveta
well
as
you
like
though
it
is
a
trifle
hard
to
pronounce
now
we
would
say
kiril
complained
of
his
failures
of
the
police
of
the
detectives
of
the
patriots
his
complaints
were
pitiful
and
depressing
he
had
been
arrested
and
had
lost
his
job
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
had
suffered
the
gleam
of
hunger
trembled
in
his
eyes
the
police
treated
me
most
horribly
complained
kiril
and
then
there
s
my
family
after
an
awkward
silence
he
continued
not
a
single
thing
escapes
them
at
our
factory
you
get
humiliated
at
every
step
they
actually
search
again
he
lapsed
into
silence
again
he
complained
they
force
their
way
into
your
soul
you
can
t
hold
private
conversations
they
stop
at
he
told
of
hunger
he
told
of
a
sick
old
woman
all
this
was
very
touching
but
it
had
lost
its
freshness
by
constant
repetition
the
pity
of
it
had
become
as
it
were
stamped
out
kiril
indeed
was
a
common
type
whose
state
of
mind
made
him
valuable
as
material
to
be
used
up
at
an
opportune
moment
in
the
interests
of
a
political
cause
stchemilov
was
saying
the
black
hundred
are
organizing
zherbenev
is
very
busy
at
this
he
s
one
of
your
genuine
kerbakh
is
with
him
another
patriot
for
you
observed
kiril
the
most
dangerous
man
in
our
town
this
zherbenev
vermin
of
the
most
foul
kind
said
stchemilov
contemptuously
i
am
going
to
kill
him
said
kiril
hotly
to
this
elisaveta
said
in
order
to
kill
a
man
you
need
to
believe
that
one
man
is
essentially
better
or
worse
than
another
that
he
is
distinct
from
the
other
not
accidentally
or
socially
but
in
the
mystic
sense
that
is
to
say
murder
only
confirms
by
the
way
elisaveta
remarked
stchemilov
we
have
come
to
talk
business
with
tell
me
what
it
is
answered
elisaveta
calmly
we
are
expecting
some
comrades
from
rouban
within
the
next
few
days
they
are
coming
to
talk
things
over
said
stchemilov
but
of
course
you
know
all
yes
i
know
said
elisaveta
we
want
to
use
the
occasion
went
on
stchemilov
to
organize
a
mass
meeting
not
far
from
here
for
our
town
factory
folk
so
here
at
last
is
your
chance
to
appear
as
an
how
can
i
be
of
any
use
asked
elisaveta
you
have
the
gift
of
expression
elisaveta
said
stchemilov
you
have
a
good
voice
an
easy
flow
of
language
and
you
have
a
way
of
putting
the
case
simply
and
clearly
it
would
be
a
sin
for
you
not
to
we
will
bring
down
the
cadets
a
peg
or
two
said
kiril
in
his
bass
voice
you
ll
forgive
kiril
comrade
elisaveta
said
stchemilov
i
don
t
think
he
knows
that
your
father
is
a
cadet
besides
he
s
a
rather
simple
frank
kiril
grew
red
i
know
so
little
said
elisaveta
timidly
what
shall
i
talk
about
and
how
you
know
enough
said
the
other
confidently
more
than
myself
and
kiril
put
together
you
do
things
remarkably
well
everything
you
say
is
so
clear
and
what
shall
i
talk
about
you
can
draw
a
picture
of
the
general
condition
of
working
men
answered
stchemilov
and
how
capital
is
forging
a
hammer
against
itself
and
compelling
labour
to
elisaveta
grew
red
and
silently
inclined
her
head
then
it
s
all
settled
comrade
asked
stchemilov
elisaveta
burst
into
a
laugh
yes
settled
she
exclaimed
cheerfully
it
was
good
to
hear
this
gravely
and
simply
pronounced
word
chapter
vi
the
sweet
quiet
night
came
and
brought
her
enchantments
the
weary
din
of
day
lost
itself
in
oblivion
the
clear
tranquil
anaemic
moon
encircled
herself
with
her
own
radiance
basked
in
her
own
light
she
looked
at
the
earth
and
did
not
dissipate
the
mist
it
was
as
if
she
had
taken
to
herself
all
the
brightness
and
translucence
of
the
sun
s
last
afterglow
a
calm
poured
itself
out
upon
the
earth
and
upon
the
water
and
embraced
every
tree
every
bush
every
blade
of
grass
a
soothing
mood
took
possession
of
elisaveta
it
struck
her
as
strange
that
they
should
have
quarrelled
and
stood
facing
one
another
like
enemies
why
shouldn
t
she
love
him
why
not
give
herself
up
to
him
submit
to
the
will
of
another
make
it
her
will
why
all
this
noisy
discussion
these
fine
yet
remote
words
about
a
struggle
about
ideals
every
one
in
the
house
she
thought
was
tired
was
it
with
the
heat
with
wrangling
with
a
secret
sorrow
inducing
sleep
soothingness
the
sisters
went
to
their
rooms
somewhat
earlier
than
usual
fatigue
and
a
languorous
sadness
oppressed
them
the
sisters
bedrooms
were
next
to
each
other
one
entering
the
other
by
a
wide
always
open
door
they
could
hear
one
another
the
even
breathing
of
her
sleeping
sister
gave
a
poignant
reality
to
the
terrible
world
of
night
and
slumber
elisaveta
and
elena
did
not
converse
long
that
night
they
parted
early
elisaveta
undressed
herself
lit
a
candle
and
began
to
admire
herself
in
the
cold
dead
indifferent
mirror
were
the
moon
s
reflections
on
the
lines
of
her
graceful
body
palpitating
were
her
white
girlish
breasts
crowned
by
two
rubies
the
living
passionate
form
stood
flaming
and
throbbing
strangely
white
in
the
tranquil
rays
of
the
moon
the
gradual
curves
of
the
body
and
legs
were
precise
and
delicate
the
skin
stretched
across
the
knees
hinted
at
the
elastic
energy
that
it
covered
and
equally
elastic
and
energetic
were
the
curves
of
the
calves
and
the
feet
elisaveta
s
body
flamed
all
over
as
though
a
fire
had
penetrated
the
whole
sweet
sensitive
flesh
and
oh
how
she
wished
to
press
to
cling
to
embrace
if
he
would
only
come
only
by
day
he
spoke
to
her
his
words
of
love
kindled
by
the
kisses
of
the
accursed
dragon
oh
if
he
would
only
come
by
night
to
the
secretly
flaming
great
fire
of
the
blossoming
flesh
did
he
love
her
was
his
a
final
and
a
love
conquering
by
the
eternal
spirit
of
the
divine
aphrodite
where
love
is
there
daring
should
be
also
is
love
then
gentle
meek
obedient
is
it
not
a
flame
decreed
to
take
what
is
its
own
without
waiting
her
eager
impatient
fancies
seethed
if
he
only
had
come
he
would
have
been
a
young
god
but
he
was
only
a
human
being
who
bowed
down
before
his
idol
he
was
a
small
slave
of
a
small
demon
he
did
not
come
he
had
not
dared
he
had
not
guessed
a
dark
grief
came
over
elisaveta
from
the
secret
seething
of
her
passion
as
she
looked
at
her
wonderful
image
in
the
mirror
elisaveta
thought
perhaps
he
is
praying
the
weak
and
the
haughty
why
do
they
pray
they
should
be
taught
to
be
joyous
to
remake
their
religion
and
be
the
first
in
the
new
elisaveta
could
not
sleep
desire
tormented
her
she
did
not
know
what
she
wanted
was
it
to
go
to
wait
she
walked
out
on
the
balcony
the
nocturnal
coolness
caressed
her
naked
body
she
stood
there
long
the
contact
of
her
naked
feet
with
the
warm
moist
boards
was
pleasant
she
looked
into
the
pale
light
of
the
garden
dreaming
there
under
the
moon
she
recalled
at
this
moment
the
details
of
the
day
s
walk
and
all
that
they
had
seen
in
trirodov
s
house
she
recalled
it
all
so
clearly
with
almost
the
vividness
of
a
hallucination
then
a
drowsiness
crept
up
seized
her
and
elisaveta
could
not
recall
later
how
she
found
herself
in
her
bed
it
was
almost
as
if
an
invisible
being
had
carried
her
tucked
her
in
and
rocked
her
to
sleep
it
was
a
restless
tormenting
sleep
she
saw
horrible
visions
nightmares
they
were
remarkably
clear
and
real
she
was
in
a
very
dusty
room
the
air
in
it
was
stifling
it
oppressed
her
breast
the
walls
were
covered
with
bookcases
filled
with
books
the
tables
were
also
covered
with
books
all
new
slender
with
bright
covers
the
were
for
some
reason
ponderous
terrible
to
look
at
a
tall
gaunt
student
entered
his
hair
was
very
straight
his
face
morose
and
grey
he
wore
spectacles
he
whispered
hide
and
he
placed
on
the
table
a
bundle
of
books
and
pamphlets
some
one
behind
elisaveta
stretched
out
a
hand
took
the
books
and
thrust
them
under
the
table
then
came
a
woman
student
strangely
resembling
the
man
student
yet
quite
different
she
was
short
thick
cheerful
and
wore
she
also
brought
a
bundle
of
books
and
said
quietly
hide
elisaveta
hid
the
books
in
the
bookcase
and
was
afraid
of
something
then
came
more
students
working
men
young
women
schoolboys
military
men
officials
and
clerks
each
placing
a
packet
of
books
on
the
table
whispered
hide
each
one
slipped
away
and
elisaveta
went
to
work
to
hide
the
books
she
put
them
in
the
table
drawer
in
the
cupboard
under
the
sofas
behind
the
doors
and
in
the
fireplace
but
the
pile
of
books
on
the
table
grew
and
grew
more
and
more
persistent
became
the
whisper
hide
there
was
no
left
and
yet
the
books
were
still
being
brought
in
there
was
no
end
to
them
everywhere
books
they
were
pressing
on
her
breast
elisaveta
awakened
some
one
s
face
was
bending
over
her
the
bedcover
slipped
from
her
handsome
body
elena
was
whispering
something
elisaveta
asked
her
in
a
drowsy
voice
did
i
wake
you
you
cried
out
so
said
elena
i
ve
had
such
a
stupid
dream
whispered
elisaveta
she
went
to
sleep
again
and
again
the
same
hoard
of
books
there
were
so
many
books
that
even
the
were
piled
up
with
them
and
a
dim
and
dusty
gleam
of
light
barely
penetrated
an
ominous
silence
tormented
her
behind
the
counter
at
her
side
stood
a
student
and
two
boys
strangely
erect
they
were
pale
and
seemed
to
wait
for
something
all
at
once
the
door
opened
noiselessly
many
men
entered
making
a
loud
noise
with
their
boots
first
a
police
official
then
another
then
a
detective
in
spectacles
a
another
a
muzhik
a
policeman
another
muzhik
another
more
and
more
came
they
filled
the
room
and
still
they
came
huge
moody
silent
fellows
elisaveta
felt
it
stifling
she
awoke
again
she
dropped
into
sleep
again
she
was
tormented
by
horrible
visions
oppressing
the
breast
she
dreamt
that
the
house
was
being
searched
an
illegal
book
exclaimed
a
detective
looking
ominously
at
her
as
he
put
a
book
on
the
table
the
pile
of
the
illegal
books
on
the
table
began
to
grow
they
were
examined
and
shaken
a
police
official
sat
down
to
make
out
a
list
the
pen
ran
on
but
there
was
not
enough
paper
more
paper
cried
the
official
page
was
filled
after
page
the
official
mocked
at
her
threatened
her
with
a
revolver
once
more
she
awoke
once
more
she
fell
asleep
and
still
another
dream
a
small
frail
schoolmaster
with
a
squeaky
voice
came
then
another
a
third
and
still
others
an
endless
flock
of
peaceful
men
with
wails
of
revolt
and
yet
another
dream
the
city
square
was
bathed
in
the
bright
sunlight
a
muzhik
appeared
and
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
hey
there
stand
up
for
your
gov
and
for
holy
russia
another
muzhik
came
in
answer
to
his
shout
then
a
third
and
a
fourth
slowly
and
steadily
the
crowd
grew
the
turmoil
increased
a
muzhik
in
a
white
apron
wearing
a
conspicuous
emblem
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
screwing
up
his
mouth
cried
like
a
madman
for
i
say
kill
em
he
threw
himself
on
elisaveta
and
began
to
strangle
her
she
awoke
again
there
was
a
dark
terrible
dream
nothing
as
yet
was
to
be
seen
it
was
hard
to
tell
what
was
happening
but
fear
filled
the
intense
darkness
dark
figures
seemed
to
throng
in
it
the
darkness
cleared
a
little
the
atmosphere
became
ominously
grey
a
narrow
courtyard
slowly
outlined
itself
flanked
by
high
walls
with
windows
closely
intersected
by
bars
her
heart
whispered
audibly
a
prison
a
prison
out
of
a
narrow
door
prisoners
were
being
conducted
into
the
still
dark
courtyard
on
a
cold
early
morning
in
winter
they
walked
in
single
file
a
soldier
a
prisoner
a
soldier
a
prisoner
a
soldier
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
it
there
was
a
steady
shuffling
of
feet
across
the
courtyard
a
small
gate
opened
in
the
wall
with
a
creaking
sound
all
walked
through
it
and
beyond
the
wall
elisaveta
already
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
flat
endless
field
of
snow
and
of
a
whole
row
of
gallows
that
stretched
into
the
invisible
distance
they
were
approaching
these
nearer
and
nearer
to
meet
their
fate
she
could
not
remember
how
it
happened
but
she
also
walked
with
them
a
soldier
strode
in
front
of
her
and
in
front
of
the
soldier
was
a
boy
though
the
boy
had
his
back
to
her
she
recognized
him
it
was
misha
terror
paralysed
her
tongue
when
she
tried
to
cry
out
she
could
not
find
her
voice
terror
fettered
her
feet
when
she
tried
to
run
she
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
terror
gripped
her
arms
when
she
tried
to
lift
them
they
hung
helplessly
at
her
sides
people
were
being
hanged
at
the
nearest
gallows
and
the
prisoners
had
to
walk
past
the
hanged
ones
to
the
gallows
beyond
misha
was
being
hanged
but
he
broke
loose
he
was
hanged
again
and
again
he
broke
loose
this
happened
an
endless
number
of
times
and
each
time
he
broke
loose
she
could
see
a
furious
face
and
the
grey
bristles
of
trimmed
moustaches
she
could
hear
the
malignant
cry
we
must
finish
him
off
a
shot
was
fired
there
was
a
low
dull
discharge
the
boy
fell
and
began
to
toss
on
the
ground
another
shot
the
boy
kept
on
tossing
the
shots
came
faster
but
the
boy
was
still
alive
elisaveta
awoke
this
time
she
did
not
go
to
sleep
again
her
heart
beat
half
with
pain
half
with
joy
because
it
was
but
a
dream
but
a
dream
her
heart
was
bright
with
exultant
joy
the
golden
arrows
of
the
yet
quiet
and
gentle
dragon
fell
softly
with
sidelong
glances
evidently
it
was
still
early
in
the
distance
elisaveta
could
hear
the
sound
of
a
horn
and
the
lowing
of
cows
the
bedroom
walls
were
tinged
with
rose
light
the
early
light
stole
in
through
the
windows
and
messaged
an
altogether
new
better
day
a
refreshing
breeze
blew
in
through
the
open
window
the
twitter
of
birds
also
entered
the
air
resounded
with
early
morning
joy
elisaveta
was
soon
aware
that
elena
was
also
awake
chapter
vii
both
sisters
had
slept
badly
that
night
elisaveta
was
worn
out
by
nightmares
while
elena
woke
several
times
and
went
to
her
both
felt
the
sweet
of
sleep
suddenly
cut
short
by
the
dragon
s
sickles
their
memories
pursued
one
another
in
a
confused
vivid
flock
they
began
to
recall
the
circumstances
of
yesterday
s
visit
a
secret
agitation
akin
to
shame
stole
over
them
little
by
little
they
conquered
this
feeling
during
the
day
alone
again
they
discussed
what
they
had
seen
at
trirodov
s
a
strange
forgetfulness
came
upon
them
the
details
of
the
visit
grew
more
vague
the
more
they
tried
to
recall
them
they
found
themselves
in
constant
disagreement
and
corrected
one
another
it
might
have
been
a
dream
now
it
seemed
one
now
the
other
was
it
reality
or
a
dream
where
is
the
whether
life
be
a
sweet
or
a
bitter
dream
it
passes
by
like
a
swift
vision
three
days
passed
by
again
the
day
was
quiet
and
clear
again
the
high
dragon
smiled
his
malignant
excessively
bright
smile
he
counted
as
he
rose
his
livid
seconds
his
flaming
minutes
and
he
let
fall
upon
the
earth
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
echo
his
but
transparent
hours
it
was
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
they
had
just
finished
luncheon
the
rameyevs
and
the
matovs
were
at
home
again
elisaveta
wrangled
with
piotr
and
as
before
the
discussion
was
long
heated
and
discordant
every
one
left
the
table
flustered
and
depressed
the
hopeless
confusion
of
it
all
deeply
affected
even
the
usually
composed
miss
harrison
the
sisters
were
left
by
themselves
they
went
out
on
the
lower
balcony
and
pretended
to
read
they
appeared
to
be
waiting
for
something
this
waiting
made
their
hearts
beat
fast
under
their
heaving
breasts
elisaveta
letting
the
book
fall
upon
her
knees
was
the
first
to
break
the
heavy
silence
i
think
he
is
coming
the
breeze
blew
at
that
moment
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
foliage
and
a
little
bird
suddenly
began
to
chirp
away
somewhere
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
depressed
garden
were
glad
because
of
these
lively
resonant
quickly
uttered
words
who
asked
elena
the
insincerity
of
her
question
made
her
flush
quite
suddenly
she
knew
very
well
whom
elisaveta
meant
the
latter
glanced
at
her
and
said
trirodov
of
course
it
is
strange
that
we
should
be
waiting
for
i
think
he
promised
to
come
said
elena
indecisively
yes
answered
elisaveta
i
think
he
said
something
at
that
strange
it
was
earlier
observed
elena
yes
i
am
mixing
it
all
up
said
elisaveta
i
don
t
understand
how
i
could
forget
so
i
too
am
tangling
things
up
badly
confessed
elena
astonished
at
herself
i
feel
very
tired
i
don
t
know
the
soft
noise
of
wheels
over
a
sandy
road
grew
closer
and
closer
at
last
a
light
trap
drawn
by
a
horse
in
english
harness
could
be
seen
turning
into
the
alley
of
birches
and
stopping
before
the
house
the
sisters
rose
nervously
their
faces
wore
their
habitually
pleasant
smiles
and
their
hands
did
not
tremble
trirodov
gave
the
reins
to
kirsha
who
drove
away
the
meeting
proved
an
embarrassing
one
the
sisters
agitation
was
evident
in
their
polite
empty
phrases
they
entered
the
presently
rameyev
accompanied
by
the
matov
brothers
came
in
to
welcome
the
guest
there
was
the
usual
exchange
of
compliments
of
meaningless
phrases
as
everywhere
as
always
piotr
was
uneasy
and
hostile
he
spoke
abruptly
and
with
evident
unwillingness
misha
looked
on
with
curiosity
he
liked
trirodov
he
had
already
heard
something
about
him
which
assured
pleasant
relations
between
them
the
conversation
developed
rapidly
and
politely
not
a
word
was
said
about
the
sisters
visit
to
trirodov
we
ve
heard
a
great
deal
about
you
began
rameyev
i
m
glad
to
know
trirodov
smiled
and
his
smile
seemed
slightly
derisive
elisaveta
remarked
i
suppose
you
think
our
being
glad
to
see
you
merely
a
polite
there
was
sharpness
in
her
voice
elisaveta
realizing
this
suddenly
flushed
rameyev
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
no
i
don
t
think
that
put
in
trirodov
there
s
real
pleasure
in
that
s
the
usual
thing
to
say
in
polite
society
said
piotr
quietly
trirodov
glanced
at
him
with
a
smile
and
turned
to
rameyev
i
say
it
in
all
sincerity
i
am
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
i
live
very
much
alone
and
so
am
all
the
more
glad
of
the
fortunate
circumstance
that
has
brought
me
here
on
a
matter
of
business
asked
rameyev
in
astonishment
i
can
put
the
matter
in
a
few
words
said
trirodov
i
wish
to
extend
my
there
was
a
tinge
of
sadness
in
rameyev
s
answer
you
have
bought
the
better
part
of
the
prosianiya
trirodov
said
it
s
not
quite
large
enough
i
should
like
to
acquire
the
rest
of
it
for
my
i
shouldn
t
like
to
let
the
rest
go
remarked
rameyev
it
belongs
to
piotr
and
as
far
as
it
concerns
me
put
in
piotr
i
d
sell
my
share
with
the
greatest
pleasure
before
those
comrade
fellows
take
it
from
me
for
misha
was
silent
but
it
was
evident
that
the
thought
of
selling
his
native
soil
was
distasteful
to
him
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
in
my
opinion
observed
rameyev
the
land
needn
t
be
sold
i
shouldn
t
advise
it
i
wouldn
t
think
of
selling
misha
s
share
until
he
came
of
age
and
i
shouldn
t
advise
you
to
sell
yours
either
misha
gladdened
glanced
gratefully
at
rameyev
who
continued
i
can
direct
you
to
another
plot
of
land
which
happens
to
be
on
sale
i
hope
it
will
suit
your
trirodov
thanked
him
his
educational
institution
now
became
the
topic
of
conversation
your
school
of
course
brings
you
into
contact
with
the
headmaster
of
the
national
schools
how
do
you
manage
to
get
along
with
him
asked
rameyev
trirodov
smiled
contemptuously
not
at
all
he
said
a
clumsy
person
this
fellow
with
his
feminine
voice
went
on
rameyev
he
s
an
ambitious
man
he
s
likely
to
do
you
an
i
m
used
to
it
answered
trirodov
calmly
we
are
all
used
to
they
might
close
your
school
suggested
piotr
in
a
tone
of
sharp
derision
and
again
they
might
not
asserted
trirodov
but
if
they
should
persisted
piotr
let
us
hope
for
the
best
said
rameyev
elisaveta
looked
affectionately
at
her
father
but
trirodov
said
quietly
in
his
own
defence
the
school
might
be
closed
but
it
is
hard
to
prevent
any
one
from
living
on
the
soil
and
running
a
farm
if
the
school
should
cease
being
a
mere
school
and
become
an
educational
farm
it
would
succeed
in
replacing
the
large
farms
as
they
are
now
run
by
their
but
that
is
utopia
said
piotr
in
some
irritation
very
well
then
we

establish
utopia
said
trirodov
unruffled
but
as
a
beginning
you
hope
to
destroy
what
exists
asked
piotr
why
exclaimed
trirodov
astonished
strangely
agitated
piotr
said
the
comrades
proposed
division
of
land
if
carried
into
force
would
lead
to
a
crushing
of
culture
and
i
don
t
understand
this
alarm
for
science
and
culture
replied
trirodov
both
one
and
the
other
are
sufficiently
strong
to
stand
up
for
nevertheless
argued
piotr
monuments
of
civilization
are
being
demolished
by
this
who
is
trying
to
replace
it
is
not
our
monuments
of
civilization
alone
that
are
being
destroyed
retorted
trirodov
patiently
this
is
very
sad
of
course
and
proper
measures
should
be
taken
but
the
sufferings
of
the
people
are
so
great
the
value
of
human
life
is
after
all
greater
than
the
value
of
such
in
this
peculiarly
russian
manner
the
conversation
quickly
passed
on
to
general
themes
trirodov
who
took
a
large
share
in
it
spoke
with
a
calm
assurance
they
listened
to
him
with
deep
attention
of
his
five
auditors
only
piotr
was
not
captivated
he
was
tormented
by
a
feeling
of
hostility
to
trirodov
he
glanced
at
trirodov
with
suspicion
and
hate
he
was
exasperated
by
trirodov
s
confident
tone
and
facile
speech
piotr
s
remarks
addressed
to
the
visitor
were
often
caustic
even
coarse
rameyev
looked
vexed
at
piotr
now
and
then
but
trirodov
appeared
not
to
notice
his
sallies
and
was
simple
tranquil
and
courteous
in
the
end
piotr
was
compelled
to
restrain
himself
and
abandon
his
sharp
manner
then
he
grew
silent
altogether
after
trirodov
s
departure
piotr
left
the
room
it
was
evident
that
he
did
not
wish
to
join
in
any
discussion
about
the
visitor
chapter
viii
the
day
was
hot
sultry
windless
helplessly
prostrate
before
the
arrowed
glances
of
the
infuriated
dragon
a
number
of
city
folk
sought
coolness
on
the
float
as
the
buffet
at
the
was
called
in
skorodozh
it
was
less
oppressive
under
the
canvas
roof
of
the
float
where
at
intervals
gusts
of
breeze
came
from
the
river
piotr
and
misha
were
in
town
to
do
some
shopping
they
stopped
on
the
float
to
get
a
glass
of
lemonade
a
steamboat
had
just
come
in
below
them
it
began
to
unload
the
passengers
and
wares
it
brought
from
neighbouring
manufacturing
towns
it
was
the
boat
s
last
the
river
higher
up
being
too
shallow
for
a
while
there
was
much
bustle
and
noise
on
the
float
the
little
tables
were
soon
occupied
by
townsfolk
and
new
arrivals
chiefly
officials
and
landlords
they
drank
wine
and
talked
loudly
though
peacefully
they
shouted
in
the
provincial
manner
and
it
was
easy
to
hear
that
many
of
the
conversations
touched
more
or
less
on
political
themes
two
men
who
sat
at
one
table
were
in
evident
agreement
yet
spoke
in
tones
of
anger
they
were
the
retired
district
attorney
kerbakh
and
the
retired
colonel
zherbenev
both
large
and
patriots
members
of
the
union
of
russian
people
their
speech
was
loud
and
vehement
and
interpolated
with
such
strange
words
and
phrases
as
treachery
sedition
hang
them
wipe
them
out
give
it
to
nikolai
ilyitch
kerbakh
was
a
small
thin
man
the
long
drooping
moustache
on
his
otherwise
face
seemed
to
be
there
merely
to
add
to
its
already
savage
appearance
he
rocked
in
his
chair
as
he
lazily
stretched
himself
his
large
coat
hung
about
his
shoulders
like
a
bag
his
highly
coloured
waistcoat
was
unbuttoned
his
string
necktie
hung
loose
half
undone
altogether
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
would
not
let
such
small
trifles
stand
in
the
way
of
his
comfort
near
him
fidgeting
restlessly
in
his
chair
was
his
son
a
slobbering
youngster
of
eight
with
a
flagging
andrey
lavrentyevitch
zherbenev
a
tall
lank
man
with
an
important
air
sat
motionless
and
erect
as
though
he
were
nailed
to
his
chair
and
surveyed
those
round
him
with
a
stern
glance
his
white
linen
coat
with
all
its
buttons
fastened
sat
on
him
as
on
a
bronze
idol
in
everything
i
say
the
parents
are
to
blame
continued
kerbakh
in
the
same
savage
voice
as
before
it
is
necessary
to
instil
the
right
ideas
from
very
childhood
now
look
at
my
children
and
he
shouted
at
his
son
with
unnecessary
loudness
though
the
two
sat
almost
nudging
each
other
sergey
yeth
lisped
the
slobbering
boy
stand
up
before
me
and
the
youngster
slipped
off
his
chair
stretched
himself
smartly
to
his
full
height
in
front
of
his
father
and
lisped
again
yeth
father
and
he
surveyed
those
sitting
at
the
other
tables
with
a
quick
sly
look
what
should
be
done
with
the
enemies
of
the
tsar
and
the
fatherland
asked
kerbakh
they
should
be
destroyed
answered
the
boy
alertly
and
afterwards
continued
his
father
the
boy
quickly
repeated
the
words
he
had
studied
and
afterwards
the
foul
corpses
of
the
vile
enemies
of
the
fatherland
should
be
thrown
on
the
kerbakh
and
zherbenev
laughed
gleefully
that
describes
them
foul
carrion
that
s
what
they
are
said
zherbenev
in
a
hoarse
voice
a
at
the
next
table
a
stranger
apparently
to
those
present
was
giving
an
order
for
a
bottle
of
beer
of
middle
age
and
medium
height
he
was
stout
or
rather
flabby
he
had
small
glittering
eyes
and
his
dress
had
seen
much
wear
kerbakh
and
zherbenev
gave
him
an
occasional
passing
glance
not
of
a
very
friendly
nature
as
though
they
took
it
for
granted
that
the
stranger
held
antagonistic
views
they
increased
the
vehemence
of
their
speeches
and
spoke
more
and
more
furiously
of
agitators
and
of
little
mother
russia
and
mentioned
by
the
way
a
number
of
local
undesirables
trirodov
among
them
the
scrutinized
the
two
speakers
for
a
long
time
it
was
evident
that
the
name
of
trirodov
often
repeated
in
kerbakh
s
remarks
aroused
an
intense
interest
even
agitation
in
the
stranger
his
fixed
scrutiny
of
his
two
neighbours
at
last
attracted
their
attention
and
they
exchanged
annoyed
glances
then
the
stranger
ventured
to
join
in
their
conversation
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
unless
i
am
mistaken
you
were
speaking
of
trirodov
am
i
right
my
dear
sir
you
began
kerbakh
the
immediately
jumped
to
his
feet
and
began
to
apologize
profusely
may
i
impose
upon
your
good
nature
to
forgive
my
impertinent
curiosity
i
am
ostrov
the
actor
tragedian
you
may
have
heard
of
me
for
the
first
time
said
kerbakh
surlily
i
ve
never
heard
the
name
said
zherbenev
the
stranger
smiled
pleasantly
as
if
he
had
been
commended
and
continued
to
speak
without
showing
the
slightest
embarrassment
well
er
i
ve
played
in
many
cities
i
m
just
passing
through
here
i
m
on
my
way
to
attend
to
some
personal
business
in
the
rouban
government
and
you
just
happened
to
mention
a
name
very
familiar
to
kerbakh
and
zherbenev
exchanged
glances
malignant
thoughts
about
trirodov
again
took
possession
of
their
minds
ostrov
continued
i
had
no
suspicion
that
trirodov
lived
here
he
is
a
very
old
and
intimate
acquaintance
of
mine
i
might
say
we
are
said
zherbenev
severely
glancing
at
ostrov
with
disapproval
something
in
ostrov
s
voice
and
manner
aroused
their
antagonism
his
glance
was
certainly
impudent
indeed
his
words
and
his
whole
demeanour
were
provokingly
arrogant
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
rude
with
him
his
words
were
proper
enough
in
themselves
we
haven
t
met
for
some
years
ostrov
went
on
how
does
he
manage
to
get
on
mr
trirodov
is
to
all
appearances
a
rich
man
said
kerbakh
unwillingly
a
rich
man
that
s
agreeable
news
in
fact
this
wealth
of
trirodov
s
is
of
comparatively
recent
origin
i
m
quite
sure
of
that
of
recent
origin
i
assure
you
repeated
ostrov
giving
a
sly
wink
and
not
of
the
cleanest
asked
kerbakh
he
winked
at
zherbenev
the
latter
made
a
grimace
and
chuckled
ostrov
looked
cautiously
at
kerbakh
why
do
you
assume
so
he
asked
i
shouldn
t
say
that
quite
clean
indeed
i
can
assure
you
of
its
clean
origin
he
repeated
with
peculiar
emphasis
misha
looked
with
curiosity
at
the
speakers
he
wished
to
hear
something
about
trirodov
but
piotr
quickly
paid
his
bill
and
rose
to
go
kerbakh
tried
to
hold
him
here
s
a
friend
of
your
friend
trirodov
he
said
i
haven
t
yet
had
time
to
become
a
friend
of
trirodov
s
piotr
answered
sharply
and
i
don
t
intend
to
as
for
his
friends
nearly
every
one
has
his
more
or
less
strange
and
he
quickly
left
with
misha
ostrov
glanced
after
him
with
a
smile
and
said
a
grave
young
mr
trirodov
has
bought
some
land
belonging
to
him
and
his
brother
explained
kerbakh
piotr
matov
s
hostility
to
trirodov
evidently
had
its
roots
in
the
chance
circumstance
that
trirodov
had
bought
the
house
and
part
of
the
estate
the
prosianiya
meadows
which
formerly
belonged
to
the
paternal
matov
many
in
the
town
of
skorodozh
remembered
very
well
dmitry
alexandrovitch
matov
the
father
of
piotr
and
mikhail
matov
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
local
district
council
for
a
single
term
and
was
not
chosen
again
he
could
not
hide
his
connexions
and
his
affairs
and
lost
his
reputation
though
the
scandal
was
hushed
up
this
happened
when
times
were
still
quiet
during
his
term
of
office
he
paid
visits
to
the
governor
more
often
than
necessary
about
the
same
time
in
response
to
some
one
s
complaint
the
president
of
the
district
council
had
been
dispatched
in
administrative
order
to
the
olonetsk
government
there
were
dark
rumours
about
matov
at
the
next
election
a
few
votes
were
given
in
his
favour
but
not
enough
he
ceased
to
have
any
connexion
with
the
district
council
matov
s
money
affairs
were
in
a
bad
state
he
led
a
heedless
life
dissipated
and
roamed
from
place
to
place
bold
headstrong
unrestrained
he
lived
only
for
his
own
pleasure
more
than
once
he
squandered
all
to
the
last
farthing
but
invariably
he
found
sudden
means
again
no
one
knew
how
and
again
he
would
lead
a
dissipated
gay
profligate
life
his
estate
was
mortgaged
and
his
relations
with
the
peasants
began
to
be
unbearable
their
own
difficulties
and
his
temper
led
to
constant
disputes
a
reign
of
spite
began
the
cattle
were
driven
into
the
corn
some
of
the
buildings
were
set
afire
some
of
the
peasants
were
gaoled
the
prosianiya
meadows
more
than
once
passed
from
a
period
of
lavish
prosperity
to
a
state
of
complete
and
hopeless
poverty
this
was
because
matov
was
lucky
enough
to
fall
heir
to
several
inheritances
not
only
did
people
say
that
luck
was
on
his
side
but
they
also
hinted
at
forged
wills
strangled
aunts
and
poisoned
children
dark
adventures
of
some
sort
enriched
and
ruined
matov
by
turns
it
was
all
like
some
dubious
fantastic
game
of
chance
during
the
lean
days
the
ingeniously
constructed
buildings
on
his
estate
were
in
a
state
of
disrepair
the
live
stock
showed
decrease
the
wheat
was
got
rid
of
quickly
and
cheaply
the
wood
was
sold
for
a
trifling
sum
for
lumber
the
labourers
were
not
paid
for
the
work
they
had
done
on
the
other
hand
during
prosperous
days
following
the
death
of
some
relative
things
used
to
pick
up
in
a
marvellous
way
companies
of
carpenters
masons
roofers
and
painters
would
make
their
appearance
the
owner
s
fancies
were
swiftly
and
energetically
carried
out
money
was
spent
lavishly
without
reckoning
the
cost
dmitry
alexandrovitch
matov
was
already
forty
years
old
and
many
dark
mad
misdeeds
weighed
on
his
shoulders
when
quite
unexpectedly
to
all
and
possibly
to
himself
he
married
a
young
girl
with
excellent
means
and
a
dark
past
there
was
a
report
that
she
had
been
the
mistress
of
a
dignitary
who
had
begun
to
grow
weary
of
her
she
managed
none
the
less
to
keep
up
her
connexions
and
to
collect
capital
she
would
have
been
very
beautiful
but
for
a
strange
stain
as
from
fire
on
her
left
cheek
which
disfigured
her
this
spot
was
very
conspicuous
and
completely
marred
the
beauty
of
her
face
very
shortly
a
fierce
hatred
arose
between
husband
and
wife
no
one
knew
why
the
gossips
said
he
was
disappointed
in
his
expectations
while
she
had
found
out
about
his
mistresses
and
revels
and
had
got
wind
of
the
dark
rumours
about
his
inheritances
the
quarrels
grew
more
frequent
quite
often
he
left
his
home
and
always
suddenly
once
he
took
all
valuables
with
him
and
decamped
leaving
with
his
wife
only
his
mortgaged
estate
his
debts
and
their
two
sons
a
short
time
afterwards
all
sorts
of
reports
came
in
about
him
some
had
seen
him
in
odessa
others
in
manchuria
later
even
rumours
ceased
then
came
the
unexpected
news
of
his
death
in
a
remote
southern
town
its
cause
remained
unknown
even
his
body
had
not
been
found
it
was
only
certain
that
he
had
been
lured
into
an
empty
uninhabited
house
there
all
trace
of
him
was
lost
matov
s
widow
soon
died
from
a
sudden
sharp
illness
her
sons
remained
in
the
house
of
rameyev
he
became
their
guardian
he
s
an
agitator
and
a
conspirator
said
zherbenev
sharply
ostrov
smiled
all
the
same
i
must
stand
up
for
my
friend
pardon
me
if
i
ask
the
question
are
these
calumnies
against
my
friend
actuated
by
patriotic
reasons
of
course
from
the
most
honourable
impulses
i
do
not
take
up
my
time
with
calumnies
said
zherbenev
dryly
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
ll
not
intrude
upon
you
any
longer
i
m
very
grateful
for
the
pleasant
conversation
and
for
the
interesting
ostrov
left
them
kerbakh
and
zherbenev
quietly
discussed
him
what
a
man
quite
a
beast
yes
what
a
character
i
shouldn
t
like
to
meet
him
alone
in
the
our
poet
and
doctor
of
chemistry
has
fine
friends
i
must
say
chapter
ix
elisaveta
and
elena
were
walking
again
on
a
path
close
to
the
road
that
connected
the
prosianiya
meadows
and
the
rameyev
estate
the
sisters
were
glad
that
it
was
so
still
and
deserted
around
them
and
that
the
turmoil
of
life
seemed
so
remote
from
them
life
with
all
its
bustling
movement
seemed
indeed
distant
and
it
was
a
joy
to
dismiss
all
its
conditions
and
proprieties
from
their
minds
and
to
walk
with
bare
feet
upon
the
soft
ground
the
sand
the
clay
and
the
grass
it
filled
their
hearts
with
a
simple
childlike
and
chaste
delight
both
were
dressed
alike
in
short
frocks
there
was
a
sash
raised
rather
high
at
the
waist
two
other
bands
crossed
each
other
at
the
breast
the
sleeves
were
cut
quite
short
at
the
shoulders
they
walked
on
farther
and
their
eyes
contemplated
gaily
and
affectionately
the
depths
of
the
valleys
the
woods
and
the
thickets
a
devotion
to
this
lovable
nature
possessed
them
it
was
a
sweet
and
tender
devotion
it
struck
a
deep
note
in
elisaveta
who
was
in
a
mood
of
expectancy
if
only
she
could
have
met
some
one
deserving
of
her
love
whom
she
might
place
at
the
crossings
of
all
earthly
and
heavenly
roads
and
to
whom
she
might
do
obeisance
this
tender
devotion
aroused
young
virginal
intoxication
in
elena
also
she
felt
herself
in
love
not
with
any
one
in
particular
but
with
everything
as
the
air
loves
in
the
springtime
kissing
all
in
its
gladness
as
a
stream
s
currents
love
when
they
brush
caressingly
past
boys
and
girls
pink
knees
such
were
the
currents
of
the
stream
that
suddenly
became
visible
winding
its
way
among
the
green
in
the
direction
of
the
river
skorodyen
into
which
it
emptied
itself
the
bridge
was
some
way
off
and
so
the
sisters
waded
the
stream
there
was
the
delicious
coolness
of
the
water
round
their
knees
they
remained
standing
on
the
bank
and
admired
the
porcupines
of
sand
studded
sparsely
with
tall
blades
of
grass
as
with
spines
also
the
round
pebbles
made
smooth
by
the
water
their
cooled
legs
felt
for
some
time
afterwards
the
sensation
of
the
water
s
loving
caresses
just
as
the
running
water
falls
in
love
with
all
beauty
that
is
immersed
in
it
so
elena
fell
in
love
with
all
that
her
vision
evoked
for
her
most
of
all
her
love
was
directed
towards
piotr
his
love
for
elisaveta
wounded
her
with
a
sweet
pain
the
sisters
descended
into
the
hollow
near
trirodov
s
colony
ascended
it
again
to
the
other
side
walked
along
the
already
familiar
path
and
opened
the
gate
this
time
it
yielded
without
effort
they
entered
soon
they
saw
a
lake
before
them
the
children
and
their
instructresses
were
bathing
there
was
a
spirit
of
buoyancy
in
the
brown
nakedness
disporting
itself
in
the
buoyant
waters
buoyant
were
the
splashes
the
laughter
and
the
outcries
the
children
and
the
instructresses
walked
out
of
the
water
upon
the
dry
ground
and
ran
naked
upon
the
sand
their
legs
bare
and
sunburnt
seemed
white
in
the
green
grass
like
young
growing
out
of
the
earth
they
suddenly
caught
sight
of
the
sisters
formed
a
ring
of
beautiful
wet
bodies
around
them
and
twirled
in
a
circle
at
a
fast
furious
pace
the
discarded
clothes
that
lay
there
close
by
seemed
unnecessary
to
the
sisters
at
that
moment
what
after
all
was
more
beautiful
and
lovely
than
the
nude
eternal
body
the
sisters
learnt
afterwards
that
they
more
often
walked
about
naked
here
than
in
their
clothes
the
radiantly
sad
nadezhda
said
to
them
to
lull
the
beast
to
sleep
and
to
awaken
the
human
being
that
is
the
reason
of
our
the
dark
maria
said
with
ecstasy
we
have
bared
our
feet
in
order
to
come
in
closer
contact
with
the
earth
we
have
become
simple
and
happy
like
people
in
the
first
garden
we
have
discarded
our
clothes
in
order
to
come
closer
to
the
elements
caressed
by
these
clothed
by
the
fire
of
the
sun
s
rays
we
have
discovered
the
human
being
in
us
this
being
is
not
the
uncouth
beast
thirsting
for
blood
or
the
townsman
counting
his
profits
it
is
the
human
being
clean
in
body
and
alive
with
so
natural
indispensable
and
inevitable
seemed
the
nakedness
of
these
young
beautiful
bodies
that
it
appeared
rather
stupid
to
put
on
one
s
clothes
afterwards
the
sisters
joined
in
with
the
naked
dancers
and
went
into
the
water
and
lay
on
the
grass
under
the
trees
it
was
pleasant
to
feel
the
beauty
the
grace
and
the
agility
of
their
bodies
among
these
other
twirling
beautiful
strong
bodies
elisaveta
s
observant
glance
detected
two
types
among
the
girl
instructresses
there
were
the
rapturous
ones
and
the
dissembling
ones
the
rapturous
ones
gave
themselves
up
with
a
bacchic
joy
to
a
life
lived
in
the
embrace
of
chaste
nature
they
fervently
carried
out
all
the
rites
of
the
colony
joyously
divested
themselves
of
all
fear
and
shame
made
great
efforts
and
and
they
laughed
and
they
flamed
overcome
by
a
passionate
thirst
of
noble
actions
and
of
love
a
thirst
which
not
all
the
waters
of
this
poor
earth
can
quench
among
this
number
were
the
sad
nadezhda
and
the
ecstatic
maria
the
others
the
dissembling
ones
were
those
who
had
sold
their
time
and
had
parted
with
all
their
habits
inclinations
and
proprieties
for
money
they
pretended
that
they
loved
children
simple
life
and
bodily
beauty
they
did
not
find
it
hard
to
dissemble
for
the
others
served
them
as
excellent
models
this
time
the
sisters
were
shown
the
buildings
of
the
colony
or
at
least
as
much
of
them
as
they
could
see
in
an
hour
and
all
sorts
of
things
made
by
the
children
books
and
pictures
things
that
belonged
to
this
or
that
child
they
were
shown
the
and
the
above
which
the
bees
buzzed
and
the
air
was
fresh
with
the
honeyed
aroma
of
flowers
half
lost
in
the
tender
softness
of
profuse
grasses
but
the
sisters
soon
left
they
had
intended
to
go
home
but
somehow
they
lost
their
way
among
the
paths
and
found
themselves
in
sight
of
trirodov
s
house
elisaveta
espied
the
high
turrets
rising
above
the
white
wall
and
recalled
trirodov
s
neither
young
nor
handsome
face
she
became
suffused
with
a
sweet
passion
as
with
a
rich
wine
but
it
was
an
emotion
not
free
from
pain
before
they
realized
it
they
were
quite
close
to
the
white
wall
near
the
ponderous
closed
gates
the
small
gate
was
open
a
quiet
white
boy
was
looking
at
the
sisters
through
the
crevice
with
an
inviting
glance
the
sisters
exchanged
irresolute
glances
shall
we
go
in
vetochka
asked
elena
yes
let
s
go
in
said
elisaveta
the
sisters
entered
and
found
themselves
in
the
garden
they
found
old
elikonida
at
the
entrance
she
was
sitting
on
the
bench
near
the
small
gate
and
was
mumbling
something
slowly
and
indistinctly
evidently
no
one
was
there
to
listen
to
her
perhaps
the
old
woman
was
talking
to
herself
old
elikonida
was
first
engaged
to
nurse
kirsha
now
she
carried
out
the
duties
of
a
housekeeper
she
had
always
been
austere
and
never
wasted
a
word
in
speaking
with
people
the
sisters
tried
to
draw
her
into
conversation
they
wanted
to
ask
her
things
about
the
ways
of
the
house
the
habits
of
trirodov
they
were
such
inquisitive
girls
elena
asked
many
questions
although
elisaveta
tried
to
restrain
her
but
they
found
out
nothing
the
old
woman
looked
past
the
sisters
and
mumbled
in
answer
to
all
questions
i
know
what
i
know
i
have
seen
what
i
have
the
quiet
children
approached
them
they
stood
motionless
and
inanimate
in
the
shade
of
the
old
trees
and
looked
at
the
sisters
with
a
fixed
expressionless
stare
the
sisters
felt
uncomfortable
and
made
haste
to
depart
they
could
hear
behind
them
the
austere
mumbling
of
elikonida
i
ve
seen
what
i
ve
and
the
quiet
children
laughed
their
quiet
quiet
laughter
which
was
truly
like
the
sudden
rustle
of
autumn
leaves
all
aflutter
in
the
air
the
sisters
walked
home
silently
they
found
the
right
path
and
walked
without
blundering
the
evening
darkness
was
coming
on
they
made
haste
the
warm
damp
earth
clung
to
their
feet
and
seemed
to
hinder
their
movements
they
were
not
far
from
their
own
house
when
they
suddenly
came
upon
ostrov
in
the
woods
he
seemed
to
be
on
the
for
something
as
he
walked
when
he
saw
the
sisters
he
turned
aside
and
stood
behind
the
trees
then
he
strode
forward
quickly
and
faced
them
with
an
unexpected
suddenness
that
made
elena
shudder
and
elisaveta
frown
ostrov
bowed
to
them
with
derisive
politeness
and
said
may
i
ask
you
something
fair
ladies
elisaveta
surveyed
him
calmly
and
said
without
haste
what
is
it
elena
was
silent
with
fear
are
you
taking
a
walk
asked
ostrov
yes
answered
elisaveta
briefly
mr
trirodov
s
house
is
somewhere
hereabouts
unless
i
m
mistaken
said
ostrov
half
questioningly
yes
you
ll
find
it
by
following
the
direction
from
which
we
came
replied
elena
she
wanted
to
conquer
her
fear
ostrov
winked
at
her
insolently
and
said
thank
you
most
humbly
and
who
may
you
be
perhaps
it
is
not
necessary
that
you
should
know
replied
elisaveta
with
a
ostrov
burst
into
laughter
and
said
with
unpleasant
familiarity
it
may
not
be
necessary
but
it
would
be
the
sisters
walked
on
rapidly
but
he
did
not
desist
they
thought
him
repulsive
there
was
something
alarming
in
his
obtrusiveness
you
evidently
live
hereabouts
fair
ladies
continued
ostrov
i
will
therefore
venture
to
ask
you
what
you
know
about
trirodov
who
interests
me
elena
laughed
perhaps
somewhat
dissemblingly
in
order
to
hide
her
agitation
and
fear
perhaps
we
don
t
live
hereabouts
she
said
ostrov
whistled
very
likely
isn
t
it
that
you
ve
come
all
the
way
from
moscow
with
your
bare
little
feet
he
shouted
angrily
we
can
not
tell
you
anything
that
can
interest
you
said
elena
coldly
you
had
better
apply
to
him
personally
it
would
be
more
ostrov
again
burst
into
a
sarcastic
laugh
and
exclaimed
i
can
t
deny
that
that
would
be
proper
my
handsome
barefoot
one
but
suppose
he
s
very
busy
eh
how
then
would
you
advise
me
to
get
this
interesting
information
i
want
the
sisters
were
silent
and
walked
on
rapidly
ostrov
persisted
you
are
of
his
colony
unless
i
m
mistaken
you
are
instructresses
there
as
far
as
one
could
judge
from
your
light
dresses
and
your
contempt
of
footwear
i
think
i
m
not
mistaken
eh
tell
me
it
s
an
amusing
life
there
isn
t
it
no
said
elisaveta
we
are
not
instructresses
and
we
do
not
live
what
a
pity
said
ostrov
incredulously
i
might
have
told
you
something
about
he
looked
at
the
sisters
attentively
they
were
silent
i
ve
got
together
all
sorts
of
information
here
and
elsewhere
he
went
on
curious
things
they
tell
about
him
very
curious
indeed
and
where
did
he
get
his
money
in
general
there
are
many
suspicious
circumstances
about
his
suspicious
for
whom
asked
elena
and
what
affair
is
it
of
ours
what
affair
is
it
of
yours
my
charming
maidens
repeated
ostrov
after
her
i
have
a
suspicion
that
you
are
acquainted
with
trirodov
and
i
therefore
hope
that
you
ll
tell
me
something
about
you
had
better
not
hope
said
elisaveta
and
why
not
observed
ostrov
in
a
familiar
tone
he
s
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
in
years
gone
by
we
lived
drank
and
roamed
together
and
quite
suddenly
i
lost
sight
of
him
and
now
quite
as
suddenly
i
ve
found
him
again
naturally
i
m
interested
as
an
old
friend
you
see
now
look
here
said
elisaveta
we
do
not
wish
to
converse
with
you
you
had
better
go
where
you
were
going
we
know
nothing
that
would
interest
you
and
we
have
nothing
to
say
to
so
that
s
it
said
ostrov
with
an
insolent
smile
and
now
my
beauty
i
d
better
tell
you
that
you
re
expressing
yourself
a
little
carelessly
suppose
i
whistled
suddenly
eh
what
for
asked
elisaveta
astonished
what
well
some
one
may
come
out
to
my
what
then
asked
elisaveta
after
a
short
silence
ostrov
resumed
his
threatening
tone
you
may
be
asked
to
give
a
few
details
about
what
trirodov
is
doing
behind
his
nonsense
said
elisaveta
in
vexation
in
any
case
i
m
only
joking
said
ostrov
suddenly
changing
his
tone
he
was
listening
intently
some
one
was
coming
towards
them
the
sisters
recognized
piotr
and
walked
quickly
to
meet
him
from
their
haste
and
flustered
manner
piotr
understood
that
the
man
was
distasteful
to
them
he
eyed
him
fixedly
and
recalled
where
he
had
met
him
whereupon
he
frowned
and
asked
the
sisters
who
is
this
a
very
inquisitive
person
who
somehow
has
got
an
idea
that
we
have
many
interesting
things
to
tell
him
about
trirodov
said
elisaveta
with
a
smile
ostrov
raised
his
hat
and
said
i
ve
had
the
honour
to
see
you
on
the
well
what
of
it
asked
piotr
sharply
well
er
i
have
the
honour
to
remind
you
said
ostrov
with
exaggerated
politeness
what
are
you
doing
here
asked
piotr
i
ve
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
these
charming
young
ladies
ostrov
began
to
explain
piotr
interrupted
him
sharply
and
now
you
let
the
young
ladies
alone
and
go
away
from
why
shouldn
t
i
have
turned
to
these
young
ladies
with
a
polite
question
and
an
interesting
tale
asked
ostrov
piotr
without
replying
turned
to
the
sisters
you
little
girls
are
ready
to
enter
into
conversation
with
every
an
expression
of
bitterness
crept
into
ostrov
s
face
possibly
this
was
only
a
game
but
it
was
certainly
well
played
it
made
piotr
feel
uncomfortable
a
vagrant
and
what
is
a
vagrant
asked
ostrov
what
is
a
vagrant
repeated
piotr
in
confusion
what
a
question
well
sir
you
have
permitted
yourself
to
use
the
word
and
i
m
rather
interested
to
know
in
what
sense
you
ve
used
it
in
its
application
to
piotr
annoyed
at
being
disconcerted
by
the
stranger
s
question
said
sharply
a
vagrant
is
one
who
roams
about
without
shelter
and
without
money
and
obtrudes
upon
others
instead
of
attending
to
his
own
thank
you
for
the
definition
said
ostrov
with
a
bow
it
is
true
that
i
have
but
little
money
and
that
i
m
compelled
to
roam
about
such
is
the
nature
of
my
what
is
your
profession
asked
piotr
ostrov
bowed
with
dignity
and
said
i
m
an
actor
i
doubt
it
said
piotr
once
more
sharply
you
look
more
like
a
you
are
mistaken
said
ostrov
in
a
flustered
way
piotr
turned
away
from
him
let
us
go
home
at
once
he
said
to
the
sisters
chapter
x
it
was
growing
dark
ostrov
was
approaching
trirodov
s
gates
his
face
betrayed
agitation
it
was
even
more
clear
now
than
by
daylight
that
life
had
used
him
hardly
he
felt
painfully
timid
in
going
to
trirodov
in
whom
he
evidently
had
certain
hopes
before
ostrov
could
make
up
his
mind
to
ring
the
bell
at
the
gates
he
walked
the
entire
length
of
the
stone
wall
that
surrounded
trirodov
s
house
and
garden
and
examined
it
attentively
without
learning
anything
only
the
entire
length
of
the
tall
wall
was
before
his
eyes
it
was
already
quite
dark
when
ostrov
stopped
at
last
at
the
main
gate
the
figures
and
old
heraldic
emblems
held
his
attention
for
a
moment
only
he
had
already
taken
hold
of
the
brass
and
paused
cautiously
as
if
it
were
his
habit
to
reconsider
at
the
last
moment
he
gave
a
sudden
shiver
a
clear
childish
voice
behind
his
back
uttered
quietly
not
ostrov
looked
on
both
sides
timidly
half
stealthily
bending
his
head
low
and
letting
it
sink
between
his
shoulders
quite
close
by
a
pale
boy
dressed
in
white
was
standing
and
eyeing
him
with
intent
scrutiny
they
won
t
hear
you
here
every
one
has
left
he
said
where
is
one
to
ring
ostrov
asked
harshly
the
boy
pointed
his
finger
to
the
left
it
was
a
slow
graceful
gesture
ring
at
the
small
gate
he
ran
off
so
quickly
and
quietly
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
not
been
there
ostrov
went
in
the
direction
indicated
he
came
to
a
high
narrow
gate
a
white
electric
shone
in
a
round
wooden
recess
ostrov
rang
and
listened
he
could
hear
somewhere
the
rapid
shivering
tones
of
a
tiny
bell
ostrov
waited
the
door
did
not
open
ostrov
rang
once
more
it
was
quiet
behind
the
door
i
wonder
how
long
there
s
to
wait
he
grumbled
then
gave
a
shout
hey
you
in
there
a
faint
muffled
sound
vibrated
in
the
damp
air
as
if
some
one
had
tittered
lightly
ostrov
caught
hold
of
the
brass
handle
of
the
gate
the
gate
opened
towards
him
easily
and
without
a
sound
ostrov
looked
round
cautiously
as
he
entered
and
purposely
left
the
gate
open
he
found
himself
in
a
small
court
on
either
side
of
which
was
a
low
wall
the
gate
swung
to
behind
him
with
a
metallic
click
had
he
himself
pulled
it
to
rather
quickly
he
could
not
recall
now
he
walked
forward
about
ten
paces
when
he
came
upon
a
wall
twice
as
high
as
the
side
walls
it
had
a
massive
oak
door
an
electric
shone
very
white
on
one
side
ostrov
rang
once
more
the
was
very
cold
almost
icy
to
the
touch
a
sensation
of
chill
passed
down
his
whole
body
a
round
window
like
a
dim
motionless
observing
eye
was
visible
high
above
the
door
ostrov
could
not
say
whether
he
waited
there
a
long
or
a
short
time
he
experienced
a
strange
feeling
of
having
become
congealed
and
of
having
lost
all
sense
of
time
whole
days
seemed
to
pass
before
him
like
a
single
minute
rays
of
bright
light
fell
on
his
face
and
disappeared
ostrov
thought
that
some
one
flashed
this
light
on
his
face
by
means
of
a
lantern
from
the
window
over
the
door
a
light
so
intense
that
his
eyes
felt
uncomfortable
he
turned
his
face
aside
in
vexation
he
did
not
wish
to
be
recognized
before
he
entered
that
was
why
he
came
in
the
dark
of
the
evening
but
evidently
he
had
been
recognized
this
door
swung
open
as
soundlessly
as
the
first
he
entered
a
short
dark
corridor
in
the
thick
wall
then
another
court
no
one
was
there
the
door
closed
noiselessly
behind
him
how
many
courts
are
there
in
this
devilish
hole
growled
ostrov
a
narrow
path
paved
with
stone
stretched
before
him
it
was
lit
up
by
a
lamp
from
a
distance
the
reflection
of
which
was
directed
straight
towards
ostrov
so
that
he
could
see
only
the
smooth
grey
slabs
of
stone
under
his
feet
it
was
altogether
dark
on
either
side
of
the
path
and
it
was
impossible
to
know
whether
a
wall
was
there
or
trees
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
to
walk
straight
on
nevertheless
he
occasionally
thrust
his
foot
out
to
either
side
of
him
and
felt
there
he
was
convinced
that
thickly
planted
prickly
bushes
grew
there
he
thought
there
was
another
hedge
beyond
that
tricks
he
grumbled
as
he
slowly
moved
forward
he
experienced
a
vague
and
growing
fear
so
as
not
to
be
caught
off
his
guard
he
put
his
left
hand
into
the
pocket
of
his
dusty
and
greasy
trousers
and
felt
there
the
hard
body
of
a
revolver
which
he
then
transferred
to
his
pocket
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
he
was
met
by
trirodov
trirodov
s
face
expressed
nothing
except
an
apparent
effort
to
suppress
his
feelings
there
was
no
warmth
or
welcome
in
his
voice
i
did
not
expect
to
see
i
ve
come
all
the
same
said
ostrov
whether
you
like
it
or
not
you
ve
got
to
receive
your
dear
there
was
contemptuous
defiance
in
his
voice
his
eyes
looked
more
insolent
than
ever
trirodov
frowned
lightly
and
looked
straight
into
ostrov
s
eyes
which
were
compelled
to
turn
aside
come
in
said
trirodov
why
didn
t
you
write
and
tell
me
that
you
wished
to
see
me
how
should
i
know
that
you
were
here
growled
ostrov
surlily
nevertheless
you
found
out
said
trirodov
with
a
vexed
smile
found
out
quite
by
accident
on
the
float
replied
ostrov
heard
you
mentioned
in
conversation
i
don
t
think
you
ll
care
to
know
what
they
he
gave
an
insinuating
smile
trirodov
merely
said
come
in
follow
they
ascended
a
narrow
very
steep
staircase
with
low
wide
stairs
there
were
frequent
turnings
in
various
directions
round
all
sorts
of
odd
corners
interrupted
by
long
landings
between
the
climbs
each
landing
revealed
a
tightly
shut
door
the
light
was
clear
and
unwavering
a
cold
gaiety
and
malice
a
motionless
irony
were
in
the
gleam
of
the
incandescent
wires
bent
inside
the
glass
pears
some
one
walked
behind
with
a
light
cautious
step
there
were
the
clicking
sounds
of
lights
being
extinguished
the
passages
they
had
just
passed
through
were
plunged
in
darkness
at
last
they
reached
the
top
of
the
stairway
they
walked
through
a
long
corridor
and
found
themselves
in
a
large
gloomy
room
there
was
a
sideboard
against
one
of
the
walls
and
a
table
in
the
middle
dishes
rested
along
shelves
around
the
room
it
was
to
all
appearances
a
it
s
quite
the
proper
thing
to
do
grumbled
ostrov
a
meal
would
do
me
no
the
light
was
strangely
distributed
half
of
the
room
and
half
of
the
table
were
in
the
shadow
two
boys
dressed
in
white
waited
at
the
table
ostrov
winked
at
them
insolently
but
they
looked
on
calmly
and
departed
quite
simply
trirodov
settled
himself
in
the
dark
part
of
the
room
ostrov
sat
down
at
the
table
trirodov
began
well
what
do
you
want
of
me
now
that
s
a
businesslike
question
answered
ostrov
with
a
hoarse
laugh
very
much
a
business
question
not
so
much
a
gracious
as
a
businesslike
question
what
do
i
want
in
the
first
place
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
there
is
a
certain
bond
between
us
our
childhood
and
all
the
rest
of
i
m
very
glad
said
trirodov
dryly
i
doubt
it
responded
ostrov
impudently
then
again
my
dear
chap
i
ve
come
for
something
else
in
fact
you
ve
guessed
what
i
ve
come
for
you
ve
been
a
psychologist
ever
since
i
can
what
is
it
you
want
asked
trirodov
can
t
you
guess
said
ostrov
winking
his
eye
no
replied
trirodov
dryly
in
that
case
there
s
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
but
to
tell
you
straight
i
need
he
laughed
hoarsely
unnaturally
then
pouring
out
a
glass
of
wine
mumbled
as
he
gulped
it
down
good
every
one
needs
money
answered
trirodov
coldly
where
do
you
intend
to
get
it
ostrov
turned
in
his
chair
he
chuckled
nervously
and
said
i
ve
come
to
you
as
you
see
you
evidently
have
lots
of
money
and
i
have
little
comment
is
needless
as
the
newspapers
would
so
that
s
it
and
suppose
i
refuse
asked
trirodov
ostrov
whistled
sharply
and
looked
insolently
at
trirodov
well
old
chap
he
said
rudely
i
don
t
count
on
your
permitting
yourself
such
a
stupid
why
not
why
not
repeated
ostrov
after
him
i
think
the
facts
must
be
as
clear
to
you
as
to
me
if
not
more
so
and
there
s
nothing
to
be
gained
by
the
world
getting
wind
of
i
owe
you
nothing
said
trirodov
quietly
i
don
t
understand
why
i
should
give
you
money
you
d
only
spend
it
recklessly
squander
it
most
and
do
you
spend
it
any
more
sensibly
asked
ostrov
with
a
malicious
smile
if
not
more
sensibly
at
least
with
more
reckoning
retorted
trirodov
in
any
case
i
m
prepared
to
help
you
only
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
i
have
little
spare
cash
and
that
even
if
i
had
it
i
d
not
give
you
ostrov
gave
a
short
abrupt
laugh
and
said
with
decision
a
little
is
of
no
use
to
me
i
need
a
lot
of
money
but
perhaps
you
ll
not
think
it
how
much
do
you
want
asked
trirodov
abruptly
twenty
thousand
roubles
replied
ostrov
making
a
determined
effort
to
brazen
it
out
i
ll
not
give
you
so
much
said
trirodov
and
i
couldn
t
even
if
i
wished
ostrov
drew
nearer
to
trirodov
and
whispered
i
ll
inform
against
what
then
asked
trirodov
untouched
by
the
threat
it
will
be
bad
for
you
it
s
a
capital
crime
as
you
know
my
dear
chap
and
of
a
no
mean
order
said
ostrov
in
a
menacing
tone
yours
my
good
fellow
said
trirodov
in
his
usual
calm
voice
i
ll
manage
to
wriggle
out
of
it
somehow
but
will
see
that
you
get
your
due
said
ostrov
with
a
laugh
you
re
making
a
sad
mistake
if
you
think
that
i
have
anything
to
fear
observed
trirodov
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
ostrov
seemed
to
grow
more
insolent
every
minute
he
whistled
and
said
banteringly
tell
me
now
if
you
please
didn
t
you
kill
him
i
no
i
didn
t
kill
him
answered
trirodov
who
then
asked
ostrov
in
his
derisive
voice
he
s
alive
said
trirodov
fiddlesticks
exclaimed
ostrov
and
he
burst
out
into
a
loud
insolent
hoarse
laugh
though
he
seemed
at
the
same
time
he
asked
what
of
those
little
prisms
which
you
ve
manufactured
i
ve
heard
that
even
now
they
are
lying
on
the
table
in
your
that
s
true
said
trirodov
dryly
and
i
m
told
that
your
present
is
not
absolutely
clean
either
observed
ostrov
yes
asked
trirodov
derisively
continued
ostrov
jeeringly
the
first
business
in
your
colony
is
conspiracy
the
second
corruption
the
third
trirodov
gave
a
stern
frown
and
asked
scornfully
you
ve
had
enough
time
to
gather
a
bouquet
of
i
ve
managed
as
you
see
whether
they
are
slanders
is
quite
another
matter
i
can
only
say
that
they
fit
you
somehow
take
for
instance
those
perverse
habits
of
yours
need
i
recall
them
to
you
i
could
remind
you
if
i
wished
of
certain
facts
from
your
early
you
know
you
are
talking
nonsense
said
trirodov
it
is
reported
went
on
ostrov
that
all
this
is
being
repeated
in
the
quiet
of
your
even
if
it
were
all
true
said
trirodov
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
anything
to
gain
by
trirodov
s
eyes
had
a
tranquil
look
he
seemed
remote
his
voice
had
a
calm
hollow
sound
ostrov
exclaimed
vehemently
don
t
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
have
fallen
into
a
trap
if
i
don
t
leave
this
place
i
have
prepared
something
that
will
send
you
to
nonsense
said
trirodov
as
quietly
as
before
i
m
not
afraid
in
the
last
resort
i
can
i
suppose
you
ll
put
on
the
mantle
of
a
political
exile
laughed
ostrov
it
s
useless
our
police
they
ll
keep
a
sharp
for
you
clever
fellows
that
they
are
never
fear
they
ll
get
you
they
ll
get
you
anywhere
you
may
be
sure
of
they
ll
not
give
me
up
where
i
m
going
said
trirodov
it
s
a
safe
place
and
you
ll
not
be
able
to
reach
me
what
sort
of
place
have
you
prepared
for
yourself
asked
ostrov
smiling
malignantly
or
is
it
a
secret
it
is
the
moon
was
trirodov
s
simple
and
tranquil
answer
ostrov
laughed
boisterously
trirodov
added
moreover
the
moon
has
been
created
by
me
she
is
before
my
window
ready
to
take
ostrov
jumped
up
in
great
rage
from
his
place
stamped
violently
with
his
feet
and
shouted
you
are
laughing
at
me
it
is
useless
you
can
t
fool
me
with
those
stupid
of
yours
tell
those
sweet
little
stories
to
the
silly
little
girls
of
the
provinces
i
m
an
old
sparrow
you
can
t
feed
me
on
trirodov
remained
unruffled
you
re
fuming
all
for
nothing
i
ll
help
you
with
money
on
a
what
sort
of
condition
asked
ostrov
with
restrained
anger
you
ll
have
to
go
from
here
very
far
for
always
answered
trirodov
i
ll
have
to
think
that
over
said
ostrov
i
give
you
a
week
come
to
me
exactly
within
a
week
and
you
ll
receive
the
ostrov
suddenly
felt
an
incomprehensible
fear
he
experienced
the
feeling
of
having
passed
into
another
s
power
he
felt
oppressed
a
stern
smile
marked
trirodov
s
face
he
said
quietly
you
are
of
such
little
value
that
i
could
kill
you
without
scruple
like
a
snake
but
i
am
tired
even
of
other
people
s
my
value
ostrov
muttered
hoarsely
and
absurdly
what
is
your
value
went
on
trirodov
you
are
a
hired
murderer
a
spy
a
ostrov
said
in
a
meek
voice
nevertheless
i
ve
not
betrayed
you
so
because
it
wouldn
t
pay
that
s
why
you
ve
not
betrayed
me
again
you
dare
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
asked
ostrov
humbly
what
is
your
condition
where
do
you
want
me
to
go
chapter
xi
trirodov
left
a
pleasant
impression
on
rameyev
rameyev
made
haste
to
return
his
visit
he
went
together
with
piotr
piotr
did
not
wish
to
go
to
trirodov
s
but
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
refuse
he
kept
frowning
on
the
way
but
once
in
trirodov
s
house
he
tried
to
be
courteous
this
he
did
constrainedly
misha
soon
made
friends
with
kirsha
and
with
some
of
the
boys
an
intimacy
sprang
up
between
the
rameyevs
and
trirodov
that
is
to
the
extent
that
trirodov
s
unsociableness
and
love
of
a
solitary
life
permitted
him
to
become
intimate
it
once
happened
that
trirodov
took
kirsha
with
him
to
the
rameyevs
and
remained
to
dinner
several
other
close
acquaintances
of
the
rameyevs
came
to
dinner
the
older
of
the
visitors
were
the
cadets
the
younger
were
the
and
the
at
the
beginning
there
was
a
long
agitated
discussion
in
connexion
with
the
news
brought
by
one
of
the
younger
guests
a
public
school
instructor
named
voronok
an
the
chief
of
police
had
been
killed
that
day
near
his
house
the
culprits
managed
to
escape
trirodov
took
almost
no
part
in
the
conversation
elisaveta
looked
at
him
with
anxious
eyes
and
the
yellow
of
her
dress
appeared
like
the
colour
of
sadness
it
had
been
remarked
by
all
that
trirodov
was
thoughtful
and
gloomy
he
seemed
to
be
tormented
by
some
secret
agitation
which
he
made
obvious
efforts
to
control
at
last
the
attention
of
all
was
turned
upon
him
this
happened
after
he
had
answered
one
of
the
girls
questions
trirodov
noticed
that
they
were
looking
at
him
he
felt
uneasy
and
vexed
with
himself
this
vexation
however
helped
him
to
control
his
agitation
he
became
more
animated
threw
off
as
it
were
some
weight
and
began
to
talk
the
glance
of
elisaveta
s
deep
blue
eyes
grew
joyous
at
this
piotr
put
in
a
remark
just
then
in
his
usual
parochial
manner
if
it
were
not
for
the
wild
changes
in
peter
s
time
everything
would
have
gone
there
was
a
tinge
of
derision
in
trirodov
s
smile
a
mistake
wasn
t
it
he
observed
but
if
you
are
going
to
look
for
mistakes
in
russian
history
why
not
start
earlier
you
mean
at
the
beginning
of
creation
said
piotr
precisely
then
but
without
going
so
far
back
let
us
pause
at
the
mongolian
period
replied
trirodov
the
historical
error
was
that
russia
did
not
amalgamate
with
the
as
if
there
were
not
enough
tartars
in
russia
now
said
piotr
provoked
that
s
precisely
why
there
are
many
because
they
didn
t
amalgamate
observed
trirodov
they
should
have
had
the
sense
to
establish
a
and
become
mohammedans
asked
svetilovitch
a
very
agreeable
person
but
very
confident
of
all
that
was
obvious
not
at
all
answered
trirodov
wasn
t
boris
godunov
a
christian
that
s
not
the
point
at
issue
all
the
same
we
and
the
catholics
of
western
europe
have
regarded
each
other
as
heretics
and
our
empire
might
have
become
a
universal
one
even
if
they
had
counted
us
among
the
yellow
race
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
yellow
race
might
have
been
considered
under
the
circumstances
quite
noble
and
the
yellow
skin
a
very
elegant
you
are
developing
a
strange
mongolian
paradox
said
piotr
contemptuously
even
now
retorted
trirodov
we
are
looked
upon
by
the
rest
of
europe
as
almost
mongols
as
a
race
mixed
with
mongolian
elements
you
know
the
saying
scratch
a
russian
and
you
will
find
a
a
discussion
arose
which
continued
until
they
left
the
table
piotr
matov
was
very
much
out
of
sorts
during
the
entire
dinner
he
found
almost
nothing
to
say
to
his
neighbour
a
young
girl
a
beauty
an
and
the
handsome
began
to
turn
more
and
more
towards
the
diner
on
the
other
side
of
her
the
priest
zakrasin
he
belonged
to
the
cadets
but
was
nearer
to
her
in
his
convictions
than
the
octobrist
matov
piotr
was
displeased
because
elisaveta
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
trirodov
and
in
what
he
was
saying
and
it
vexed
him
because
elena
also
now
and
then
let
her
softened
gaze
rest
upon
trirodov
he
felt
he
wanted
to
say
provoking
things
to
trirodov
yet
he
is
a
guest
reflected
piotr
to
himself
but
at
last
he
could
hold
out
no
longer
he
felt
that
he
must
in
one
way
or
another
shake
trirodov
s
piotr
walked
up
to
him
and
swaying
before
him
on
his
long
thin
legs
remarked
without
almost
the
slightest
effort
to
conceal
his
animosity
some
days
ago
on
the
pier
a
stranger
made
inquiries
about
you
kerbakh
and
zherbenev
were
talking
nonsense
and
he
sat
down
near
them
and
seemed
very
interested
in
rather
flattering
said
trirodov
unwillingly
i
can
not
say
to
what
an
extent
it
is
flattering
said
piotr
maliciously
in
my
opinion
there
was
little
to
recommend
him
his
appearance
was
rather
suspicious
that
of
a
ragamuffin
in
fact
though
he
insists
he
s
an
actor
i
have
my
doubts
he
says
you
are
old
friends
a
most
insolent
trirodov
smiled
elisaveta
remarked
with
some
agitation
we
met
him
some
days
ago
not
far
from
your
it
s
quite
a
lonely
place
observed
trirodov
in
an
uncertain
voice
piotr
went
on
to
describe
him
yes
that
s
the
actor
ostrov
assented
trirodov
elisaveta
feeling
a
strange
unrest
put
in
he
seemed
to
have
gone
around
the
neighbourhood
looking
about
and
asking
questions
i
wonder
what
he
can
be
up
evidently
a
spy
said
the
young
contemptuously
trirodov
without
expressing
the
slightest
astonishment
remarked
do
you
think
so
it
s
possible
i
really
don
t
know
i
haven
t
seen
him
for
five
years
the
young
thinking
that
trirodov
felt
offended
at
her
reference
to
his
acquaintance
added
affectedly
you
know
him
well
then
please
pardon
i
don
t
know
his
present
condition
put
in
trirodov
everything
is
it
s
impossible
to
be
responsible
for
all
chance
acquaintances
interpolated
rameyev
trirodov
turned
to
piotr
and
what
did
he
say
about
me
but
his
voice
did
not
express
any
especial
curiosity
piotr
replied
with
a
sarcastic
smile
he
said
very
little
but
asked
a
great
deal
he
said
that
you
knew
him
very
well
in
any
case
i
soon
yes
i
have
known
him
a
long
time
was
trirodov
s
calm
answer
perhaps
not
too
well
yet
i
know
him
i
had
some
dealings
with
i
think
he
paid
you
a
visit
yesterday
yes
said
trirodov
in
reply
to
elisaveta
s
question
he
came
to
see
me
last
evening
quite
late
i
don
t
know
why
he
chose
such
a
late
hour
he
asked
assistance
his
demands
were
large
i
will
give
him
what
i
can
he
s
going
away
from
all
this
was
said
in
jerks
unwillingly
no
one
seemed
to
care
to
continue
the
subject
further
but
at
this
moment
quite
unexpectedly
to
all
kirsha
entered
into
the
conversation
he
went
up
to
his
father
and
said
in
a
quiet
but
audible
voice
he
purposely
came
late
while
i
slept
so
that
i
shouldn
t
see
him
but
i
remember
him
when
i
was
very
little
he
used
to
show
me
dreadful
tricks
i
don
t
remember
them
now
i
can
only
remember
that
i
used
to
get
frightened
and
that
i
all
looked
in
astonishment
at
kirsha
exchanged
glances
and
smiled
you
must
have
seen
it
in
a
dream
kirsha
said
trirodov
quietly
then
turning
to
the
older
people
boys
of
his
age
love
fantastic
tales
even
we
love
utopia
and
read
wells
the
very
life
which
we
are
now
creating
is
a
joining
as
it
were
of
real
existence
with
fantastic
and
utopian
elements
take
for
example
this
affair
of
in
this
manner
trirodov
interrupted
the
conversation
about
ostrov
and
changed
it
to
another
subject
that
was
agitating
all
circles
at
the
time
he
left
very
soon
after
that
the
others
also
stayed
but
a
short
time
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
irritation
and
hostility
after
the
guests
had
gone
rameyev
reproached
piotr
my
dear
petya
you
shouldn
t
have
done
that
it
isn
t
hospitable
you
were
looking
all
the
time
at
trirodov
as
if
you
were
getting
ready
to
send
him
to
all
the
piotr
replied
with
a
controlled
gruffness
yes
precisely
to
all
the
devils
you
have
guessed
my
feelings
rameyev
eyed
him
incredulously
and
said
why
my
dear
fellow
why
repeated
piotr
giving
free
rein
to
his
irritation
what
is
he
a
charlatan
a
visionary
a
magician
is
he
in
partnership
with
some
unclean
power
what
do
you
think
of
it
or
is
it
the
devil
himself
come
in
a
human
shape
a
little
grey
demon
that
s
enough
petya
what
are
you
saying
said
rameyev
with
annoyance
elisaveta
smiled
an
incredulous
smile
full
of
gentle
irony
a
golden
saddened
smile
set
off
by
the
melancholy
yellow
rose
in
her
black
hair
and
elena
s
astonished
eyes
dilated
widely
think
it
over
yourself
uncle
went
on
piotr
and
look
around
you
he
has
bewitched
our
little
girls
completely
well
if
he
has
said
elena
with
a
gay
smile
it
s
only
just
a
little
as
far
as
i
am
elisaveta
flushed
but
said
with
composure
yes
he
s
interesting
to
listen
to
and
it
s
no
use
stuffing
one
s
there
she
admits
it
exclaimed
piotr
angrily
admits
what
asked
elisaveta
in
astonishment
that
for
the
sake
of
this
cold
vain
egoist
you
are
ready
to
forget
every
i
ve
not
noticed
either
his
vanity
or
his
egoism
said
elisaveta
coldly
i
wonder
how
you
ve
managed
to
know
him
so
well
or
so
all
this
is
pitiful
and
absurd
nonsense
only
an
excuse
for
starting
a
quarrel
said
piotr
angrily
petya
you
envy
him
retorted
elisaveta
with
unaccustomed
sharpness
then
feeling
that
she
had
overstepped
the
mark
she
added
do
forgive
me
petya
but
really
you
are
exasperating
sometimes
with
your
personal
envy
him
why
should
i
he
said
hotly
tell
me
what
useful
thing
has
he
done
to
be
sure
he
has
published
a
few
tales
a
volume
of
verses
but
name
me
even
a
single
work
of
his
prose
or
verse
that
contains
the
slightest
sense
or
his
verses
began
elisaveta
but
piotr
would
not
let
her
continue
tell
me
where
is
his
talent
what
is
he
famous
for
all
that
he
writes
only
seems
like
poetry
if
you
look
at
it
closely
you
will
see
that
it
is
bookish
forced
dry
it
is
diabolically
suggestive
without
being
rameyev
interrupted
in
a
conciliatory
tone
you
re
unjust
you
can
t
deny
him
let
us
admit
then
that
there
s
something
in
his
work
not
altogether
bad
continued
piotr
who
is
there
nowadays
who
can
not
put
together
some
versicles
yet
what
is
there
really
i
should
respect
in
him
he
s
nothing
but
a
corrupt
ridiculous
and
person
yet
elisaveta
considers
him
a
handsome
man
i
never
said
anything
about
his
being
handsome
protested
elisaveta
as
for
his
corruption
isn
t
it
purely
town
tattle
she
frowned
and
grew
red
her
blue
eyes
flared
up
with
small
greenish
flames
piotr
walked
angrily
out
of
the
room
why
is
he
so
annoyed
asked
rameyev
in
astonishment
elisaveta
lowered
her
head
and
said
with
childish
bashfulness
i
don
t
she
could
not
repress
an
ashamed
smile
at
her
timid
words
because
she
felt
like
a
little
girl
who
was
concealing
something
at
last
she
overcame
her
shame
and
said
he
s
jealous
chapter
xii
trirodov
loved
to
be
alone
solitude
and
silence
were
a
holiday
to
him
how
significant
seemed
his
lonely
experiences
to
him
how
delicious
his
devotion
to
his
visions
some
one
came
to
him
something
appeared
before
him
wonderful
apparitions
visited
him
now
in
dream
now
in
his
waking
hours
and
they
consumed
his
sadness
sadness
was
trirodov
s
habitual
state
only
while
writing
his
poems
and
his
prose
did
he
find
an
astonishing
state
in
which
time
is
shrivelled
up
and
consumed
in
which
great
inspiration
consoles
her
chosen
ones
with
divine
exultation
for
all
burdens
for
all
annoyances
in
life
he
wrote
much
published
little
his
fame
was
very
limited
there
were
few
who
read
his
verses
and
prose
and
even
among
these
but
a
few
who
acknowledged
his
talent
his
stories
and
lyrical
poems
were
not
distinguished
by
any
especial
obscurity
or
any
especial
decadent
mannerisms
they
bore
the
imprint
of
something
strange
and
exquisite
it
needed
an
especial
kind
of
soul
to
appreciate
this
poetry
which
seemed
so
simple
at
the
first
glance
yet
actually
so
out
of
the
ordinary
to
others
from
among
those
who
knew
him
the
public
s
ignorance
of
him
appeared
inexplicable
his
capabilities
seemed
sufficiently
great
to
awaken
the
attention
and
admiration
of
the
crowd
but
he
to
some
extent
detested
people
perhaps
because
he
was
too
confident
of
his
own
genius
and
he
never
made
a
definite
effort
to
gratify
them
and
that
was
why
his
works
were
only
rarely
published
in
general
trirodov
did
not
encourage
intimacies
with
people
he
found
it
painful
to
look
with
involuntary
penetration
into
the
confusion
of
their
dark
foggy
souls
he
found
himself
at
ease
only
in
the
company
of
his
wife
love
makes
kin
of
souls
but
his
wife
had
died
a
few
years
ago
when
kirsha
was
six
years
old
kirsha
remembered
her
he
could
not
forget
her
and
kept
on
recalling
her
trirodov
for
some
reason
associated
his
wife
s
death
with
the
birth
of
his
son
though
there
was
no
obvious
connexion
his
wife
died
from
a
casual
sharp
illness
trirodov
thought
she
bore
and
therefore
had
to
die
life
is
only
for
the
after
her
death
he
always
awaited
her
there
was
for
him
the
consoling
thought
she
will
come
she
will
not
deceive
me
she
will
give
a
sign
she
will
take
me
with
and
life
became
as
easy
to
bear
as
a
vacillant
vision
seen
in
dream
he
loved
to
look
at
his
wife
s
portrait
it
was
painted
by
a
celebrated
english
artist
and
hung
in
his
study
there
were
also
many
photographic
reproductions
of
her
it
was
his
joy
to
muse
of
her
and
musing
to
delight
in
images
of
her
handsome
face
and
her
lovely
body
sometimes
his
solitude
was
broken
by
the
intrusion
of
external
life
and
external
unemotional
love
a
woman
used
to
come
in
to
him
sometimes
a
strange
undemanding
woman
who
seemed
to
come
from
nowhere
and
to
lead
to
nowhere
trirodov
had
had
relations
with
her
for
several
months
she
was
an
instructress
in
the
local
girls
school
ekaterina
nikolayevna
alkina
a
quiet
tranquil
cold
creature
with
dark
red
hair
and
a
thin
face
the
dull
pallor
of
which
emphasized
the
impressively
vivid
lips
of
her
large
mouth
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
sensuality
and
colour
of
the
face
had
poured
themselves
into
the
lips
and
made
them
startlingly
and
painfully
vivid
and
suggestive
of
sin
she
had
married
and
had
parted
from
her
husband
she
had
a
son
who
lived
with
her
she
was
an
and
worked
in
the
organization
but
all
this
was
merely
incidental
in
her
life
she
met
trirodov
in
party
work
her
comrades
understood
as
by
some
intuition
that
in
order
to
carry
on
negotiations
with
trirodov
who
did
not
permit
himself
any
intimacy
with
them
it
was
necessary
to
choose
this
woman
and
now
alkina
had
come
again
and
began
as
always
i
ve
come
on
trirodov
regarded
her
with
a
deep
tranquil
glance
and
answered
her
with
the
usual
commonplaces
of
welcome
slightly
agitated
by
hidden
desires
alkina
spoke
of
the
business
in
hand
it
had
already
been
decided
that
the
party
orator
who
was
to
come
to
speak
at
the
projected
mass
meeting
would
be
quartered
at
trirodov
s
this
was
thought
to
be
the
least
dangerous
place
alkina
came
to
say
that
the
orator
was
expected
that
evening
it
was
necessary
to
bring
him
to
trirodov
s
house
in
such
a
way
that
the
town
should
not
know
anything
about
it
as
soon
as
they
had
decided
at
what
entrance
he
should
be
received
trirodov
went
out
of
the
room
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
the
agreeable
consciousness
of
creative
mystery
filled
him
with
joy
when
trirodov
returned
alkina
was
standing
at
the
table
and
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
new
book
her
hands
trembled
slightly
she
glanced
expectantly
at
trirodov
she
appeared
to
wish
to
say
something
meaningful
and
tender
but
instead
she
resumed
her
remarks
on
business
she
told
him
what
was
new
in
town
in
her
school
in
the
organization
about
the
confiscation
of
the
local
newspaper
about
personalities
ordered
to
leave
town
by
the
police
about
the
factory
ferment
who
will
be
our
own
speakers
at
the
mass
meeting
asked
trirodov
bodeyev
from
the
school
for
i
do
not
like
his
manner
of
speaking
said
trirodov
he
s
a
good
party
workman
observed
alkina
with
a
timid
smile
he
s
to
be
valued
for
you
know
of
course
that
i
am
not
much
of
a
party
man
said
trirodov
alkina
was
silent
she
trembled
lightly
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
then
suddenly
ceased
to
be
agitated
only
her
vivid
lips
speaking
slowly
seemed
to
be
alive
in
her
pale
face
giorgiy
sergeyevitch
will
you
love
me
a
little
trirodov
smiled
he
sat
quietly
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
simply
and
dispassionately
he
did
not
answer
at
once
alkina
asked
again
with
her
sad
and
gentle
humility
perhaps
you
haven
t
the
time
nor
the
desire
no
katya
i
shall
be
glad
answered
trirodov
calmly
you
ll
find
it
convenient
in
there
and
he
signified
with
his
eyes
the
little
neighbouring
room
which
had
no
other
exit
alkina
flushed
lightly
and
said
if
you
will
permit
me
i
d
rather
undress
here
it
would
give
me
joy
to
have
you
look
at
me
a
long
trirodov
helped
her
to
undo
the
clasps
of
her
skirt
alkina
sat
down
on
a
chair
bent
over
and
began
to
undo
the
buttons
of
her
boots
then
with
evident
enjoyment
at
having
freed
her
feet
she
walked
slowly
across
the
floor
towards
the
door
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
as
you
know
i
have
but
one
joy
she
said
she
gracefully
threw
off
her
clothes
and
stood
before
trirodov
with
uplifted
arms
she
was
sinuously
slender
like
a
white
serpent
crossing
the
fingers
of
her
upraised
hands
she
bent
her
whole
body
forward
so
that
she
appeared
more
sinuously
slender
than
ever
and
the
curve
of
her
body
almost
resembled
a
white
ring
then
she
relaxed
her
arms
stood
up
erect
all
tranquil
and
and
said
i
want
you
to
take
a
good
look
at
me
i
haven
t
grown
old
yet
have
i
and
not
altogether
faded
trirodov
surveyed
her
with
admiration
and
said
quietly
katya
you
are
as
handsome
as
alkina
was
mistrustful
it
s
true
isn
t
it
that
clothes
have
too
long
cramped
my
body
and
injured
the
skin
how
can
my
body
be
handsome
you
are
graceful
and
flexible
answered
trirodov
the
lines
of
your
body
are
somewhat
elongated
but
wholly
elastic
if
any
one
were
to
measure
your
body
he
would
find
no
error
in
its
alkina
scrutinized
herself
attentively
and
went
on
incredulously
the
lines
are
good
but
the
colour
i
believe
you
once
said
that
russians
often
have
unpleasant
complexions
when
i
look
on
the
whiteness
of
my
body
i
am
reminded
of
plaster
of
paris
and
i
begin
to
weep
because
i
am
so
no
katya
asserted
trirodov
the
whiteness
of
your
body
is
not
like
plaster
of
paris
it
is
marble
slightly
it
is
milk
poured
into
a
pink
crystal
vase
it
is
mountain
snow
lit
up
with
the
last
glow
of
sunset
it
is
a
white
reverie
suffused
with
rose
alkina
smiled
joyously
and
flushed
lightly
as
she
asked
him
will
you
take
a
few
snapshots
of
me
otherwise
i
shall
weep
because
i
am
so
ugly
and
so
meagre
that
you
do
not
wish
to
recall
sometimes
my
face
and
my
yes
answered
trirodov
i
have
a
few
films
alkina
laughed
gleefully
and
said
now
kiss
she
bent
over
trirodov
and
almost
fell
into
his
arms
the
kisses
seemed
tranquil
and
innocent
it
might
have
been
a
sister
kissing
a
brother
how
gentle
and
elastic
her
skin
was
under
his
hands
alkina
pressed
against
him
with
a
submissive
yielding
movement
trirodov
carried
her
to
the
wide
soft
couch
she
lay
in
his
arms
timidly
and
quietly
and
looked
straight
into
his
eyes
with
a
simple
innocent
look
when
the
sweet
and
deep
minutes
passed
followed
by
fatigue
and
shame
alkina
lay
there
motionlessly
with
eyes
and
then
said
suddenly
i
ve
been
wanting
to
ask
you
and
somehow
couldn
t
decide
to
do
you
detest
me
perhaps
you
think
me
very
shameless
she
turned
her
face
towards
him
and
looked
at
him
with
frightened
ashamed
eyes
and
he
answered
her
with
his
usual
resolution
no
katya
shame
is
often
needed
in
order
that
we
may
gain
control
over
alkina
once
more
lay
back
calmly
basking
naked
under
his
glances
as
under
the
rays
of
the
high
dragon
trirodov
was
silent
alkina
laughed
quietly
and
said
my
husband
used
to
be
so
respectable
mean
and
polite
he
never
beat
me
he
was
not
a
cultured
man
for
nothing
and
he
never
even
used
coarse
words
if
he
had
but
called
me
a
fool
i
sometimes
think
that
i
wouldn
t
have
left
him
if
our
quarrels
hadn
t
passed
so
quietly
if
he
had
but
beat
me
pulled
me
by
my
hair
lashed
me
with
sweet
asked
trirodov
life
is
so
dull
continued
alkina
one
struggles
in
the
nets
of
petty
annoyances
if
one
could
but
cry
out
but
give
wail
to
one
s
yearning
one
s
woe
one
s
unendurable
pain
she
said
this
with
a
passion
unusual
to
her
and
grew
silent
chapter
xiii
it
was
drawing
towards
evening
and
once
more
trirodov
was
alone
tormented
by
his
unceasing
sadness
his
mind
was
in
a
whirl
he
was
in
a
state
which
was
like
the
foreboding
of
a
nightmare
his
and
were
full
of
the
day
s
impressions
full
of
burning
cruel
reveries
it
had
just
grown
dark
a
fire
was
visible
on
a
height
near
the
town
the
town
boys
were
making
merry
they
had
lit
a
bonfire
and
were
throwing
the
brands
into
the
air
as
they
rose
swiftly
the
burning
brands
appeared
like
skyrockets
against
the
blue
sky
and
these
beautiful
flights
of
fire
in
the
darkness
gave
joy
and
sadness
kirsha
silent
as
always
came
to
his
father
he
placed
himself
at
the
window
and
looked
out
with
his
dark
sad
eyes
upon
the
distant
fires
of
john
s
eve
trirodov
went
up
to
him
kirsha
turned
quietly
towards
his
father
this
will
be
a
terrible
trirodov
answered
as
quietly
there
will
be
nothing
terrible
don
t
be
afraid
kirsha
you
had
better
go
to
sleep
my
boy
it
is
as
if
he
had
not
heard
his
father
kirsha
went
on
the
dead
will
soon
rise
from
their
the
dead
are
already
rising
from
their
graves
replied
trirodov
a
strange
feeling
of
astonishment
stirred
within
him
why
did
he
speak
of
this
or
was
it
due
to
the
urgency
of
the
questioner
s
desire
quietly
ever
so
quietly
half
questioning
half
relating
kirsha
persisted
the
dead
will
walk
on
the
navii
footpath
the
dead
will
speak
navii
and
again
as
though
submitting
to
a
strange
will
not
his
own
trirodov
replied
the
dead
have
already
risen
they
are
already
walking
upon
the
navii
footpath
towards
the
navii
town
they
are
already
speaking
navii
words
about
navii
and
kirsha
asked
are
you
going
i
am
going
said
trirodov
after
a
brief
silence
i
am
going
with
you
said
kirsha
resolutely
you
had
better
not
go
dear
kirsha
said
his
father
tenderly
but
kirsha
persistently
repeated
i
will
spend
this
night
with
you
there
at
the
navii
footpath
i
will
see
and
i
will
hear
i
will
look
into
dead
trirodov
said
sternly
i
do
not
wish
to
take
you
with
me
you
ought
to
remain
there
was
entreaty
in
kirsha
s
voice
perhaps
mother
will
come
trirodov
falling
into
deep
thought
said
finally
very
well
come
with
the
evening
dragged
on
slowly
and
sadly
the
father
and
son
waited
it
grew
quite
dark
by
the
time
they
went
they
walked
through
the
garden
past
the
closed
greenhouse
with
its
mysteriously
glittering
the
quiet
children
were
not
yet
asleep
quietly
they
swung
in
the
garden
upon
their
swings
quietly
clinked
the
swing
rings
quietly
creaked
the
wooden
seats
upon
the
swings
sat
the
quiet
children
lit
up
by
the
dead
moon
and
cooled
by
the
night
breeze
and
they
swung
softly
and
sang
their
songs
the
night
listened
to
their
quiet
songs
and
the
full
clear
dead
moon
also
kirsha
lowering
his
voice
so
that
the
quiet
children
might
not
hear
asked
why
don
t
they
sleep
they
swing
on
their
swings
neither
upward
nor
downward
but
evenly
why
do
they
do
this
they
must
not
sleep
answered
trirodov
also
in
a
whisper
they
can
not
sleep
until
the
dawn
grows
rosy
until
the
dawn
begins
to
laugh
there
is
really
no
reason
why
they
should
sleep
they
can
sleep
as
well
by
again
kirsha
asked
will
they
go
with
us
they
want
to
no
kirsha
they
don
t
want
don
t
want
anything
repeated
kirsha
sadly
they
ought
not
to
go
with
us
unless
we
call
shall
we
call
them
asked
kirsha
joyously
we
shall
call
one
which
one
would
you
like
kirsha
after
some
thought
said
very
well
we
ll
call
grisha
said
trirodov
he
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
swings
and
called
out
grisha
a
boy
who
resembled
the
nadezhda
quietly
jumped
down
from
his
swing
and
walked
behind
them
without
approaching
too
closely
the
other
quiet
children
looked
tranquilly
after
him
and
continued
to
swing
and
to
sing
as
before
trirodov
opened
the
gate
and
was
followed
by
kirsha
and
grisha
the
night
hovered
all
around
them
and
the
forgotten
navii
footpath
stretched
in
a
black
strip
through
the
darkness
kirsha
shivered
he
felt
the
cold
heavy
earth
under
his
bare
feet
the
cold
air
pressed
against
his
bare
knees
the
cold
moist
freshness
of
the
night
blew
against
his
breast
he
heard
his
father
ask
in
a
low
voice
kirsha
are
you
not
afraid
no
whispered
kirsha
as
he
breathed
in
the
fresh
aroma
of
the
dew
and
the
light
mist
the
light
of
the
moon
was
seductive
with
mystery
she
smiled
with
her
lifeless
tranquil
face
and
appeared
to
be
saying
what
was
will
be
again
what
was
will
happen
more
than
the
night
was
peaceful
and
clear
they
walked
a
long
time
trirodov
and
kirsha
and
some
distance
behind
them
the
quiet
grisha
followed
at
last
there
appeared
quite
near
peering
through
the
mist
the
low
white
cemetery
wall
another
road
cut
across
theirs
quite
narrow
its
worn
cobblestones
gleamed
dimly
in
the
moonlight
the
road
of
the
living
and
the
road
of
the
dead
crossed
each
other
at
the
entrance
of
the
cemetery
in
the
field
near
the
crossing
several
mounds
were
visible
they
were
the
unmarked
graves
of
suicides
and
convicts
the
whole
neighbourhood
bewitched
with
mystery
and
fear
seemed
oppressed
the
flat
field
stretched
far
all
enveloped
in
a
light
mist
far
to
the
left
the
town
fires
showed
their
vague
glimmers
through
the
mist
and
marked
off
by
the
wall
of
mist
the
town
seemed
to
be
very
distant
and
to
be
guarding
jealously
from
the
fields
of
night
the
tumultuous
voices
of
life
an
old
witch
grey
and
all
bent
appeared
from
somewhere
she
swung
a
crutch
and
stumbled
on
in
haste
she
was
mumbling
angrily
it
doesn
t
smell
of
our
spirit
strangers
have
come
why
have
they
come
what
can
strangers
want
here
what
are
they
seeking
they
ll
find
what
they
don
t
want
to
find
ours
will
see
them
and
will
tear
them
to
pieces
and
will
scatter
the
pieces
before
all
the
suddenly
there
was
a
weird
rustle
there
rose
all
about
them
the
squeak
of
piping
little
voices
and
the
sounds
of
a
confused
scampering
at
the
crosspaths
there
darted
in
all
directions
as
thick
as
dust
countless
hordes
of
grey
sprites
and
evil
spirits
their
running
was
so
impetuous
that
they
could
have
borne
along
with
them
every
living
soul
and
it
could
already
be
seen
that
running
in
their
midst
were
the
pitiful
souls
of
little
people
kirsha
whispered
in
a
voice
full
of
fear
quicker
quicker
into
the
ring
they
will
bear
us
away
if
we
don
t
mark
ourselves
trirodov
called
quietly
come
here
come
here
quiet
boy
draw
a
circle
around
us
with
your
nocturnal
little
they
no
sooner
had
succeeded
in
marking
themselves
in
with
the
magic
line
than
the
dead
began
to
pass
down
the
navii
path
the
throng
of
the
dead
submitting
to
some
evil
malediction
walked
towards
the
town
the
spectres
walked
in
the
nocturnal
silence
and
the
traces
they
left
behind
them
were
light
curious
and
hardly
distinguishable
whispered
conversations
were
heard
lifeless
words
the
dead
walked
at
random
without
any
denned
order
at
the
beginning
the
voices
merged
into
a
general
drone
and
only
afterwards
by
straining
one
s
ears
it
was
possible
to
distinguish
separate
words
and
whole
phrases
be
good
yourself
that
s
the
chief
for
mercy
s
sake
what
perversion
what
immorality
plenty
of
food
and
plenty
of
clothes
what
more
can
one
want
i
haven
t
sinned
that
s
what
they
deserve
kisses
are
not
for
in
the
beginning
all
the
dead
fused
into
one
dark
grey
mass
but
gradually
if
one
looked
intently
one
could
distinguish
the
separate
corpses
one
nobleman
who
passed
by
had
a
cap
with
a
red
band
on
his
head
he
was
saying
with
calm
and
deliberation
the
divine
right
of
ownership
should
be
inviolable
we
and
our
ancestors
have
built
up
the
russian
another
of
the
same
class
who
walked
beside
him
remarked
my
motto
autocracy
orthodoxy
and
nationality
my
credo
a
strong
redeeming
a
priest
in
a
black
vestment
swung
a
censer
and
cried
in
a
tenor
voice
every
soul
should
submit
to
sovereign
dominion
the
hand
that
gives
will
not
grow
a
wise
muzhik
passed
by
muttering
we
know
everything
but
are
not
saying
anything
just
yet
when
you
don
t
know
anything
they
leave
you
alone
only
you
can
t
cover
up
your
mouth
with
a
several
soldiers
walked
past
together
they
bawled
their
indecorous
songs
their
faces
were
in
colour
they
stank
of
sweat
putrescence
bad
tobacco
and
vodka
i
have
laid
down
my
stomach
for
my
faith
my
tsar
and
my
fatherland
a
smart
young
colonel
was
saying
after
him
came
a
thin
man
with
the
face
of
a
jesuit
and
cried
out
loudly
russia
for
the
russians
a
stout
merchant
kept
on
repeating
if
you
don
t
cheat
you
can
t
sell
your
goods
even
a
fur
coat
might
be
turned
inside
out
your
penny
makes
you
well
thought
of
an
austere
freckled
woman
was
saying
beat
me
seeing
that
i
m
your
woman
but
there
s
no
law
that
ll
let
you
tie
up
with
a
girl
so
long
as
you
ve
got
a
wife
a
muzhik
walked
at
her
side
a
dirty
fellow
who
said
nothing
and
hiccuped
once
more
there
was
a
nobleman
large
stout
bristling
he
ranted
hang
them
flog
them
trirodov
turned
to
kirsha
don
t
be
afraid
kirsha
these
are
dead
kirsha
silently
nodded
his
head
a
mistress
and
her
walked
together
and
exchanged
quarrelsome
words
god
didn
t
make
all
the
trees
in
the
forest
alike
i
am
a
white
bone
you
are
a
black
bone
i
am
a
gentlewoman
you
are
a
you
may
be
a
gentlewoman
yet
maybe
trash
but
still
from
the
quite
close
to
the
magic
line
there
was
an
apparent
effort
on
the
part
of
an
elegantly
dressed
woman
and
a
young
man
of
the
breed
of
dandies
to
emerge
from
the
general
throng
they
had
been
only
recently
buried
and
they
exhaled
the
odour
of
fresh
corpses
the
woman
coquettishly
moved
her
lips
and
complained
in
a
hoarse
creaking
voice
they
ve
forced
us
to
walk
with
all
these
they
might
have
let
us
walk
separately
from
all
this
common
the
dandy
suddenly
complained
in
a
squeaking
voice
be
careful
there
muzhik
don
t
nudge
what
a
dirty
fellow
the
muzhik
had
evidently
only
just
jumped
out
of
his
grave
he
was
barely
awake
and
he
had
not
yet
realized
himself
or
understood
his
condition
he
was
all
dishevelled
and
in
rags
his
eyes
were
turbid
curses
and
indecent
words
issued
from
his
dead
lips
he
was
angry
because
he
had
been
disturbed
and
he
bawled
by
what
right
you
are
lying
there
and
not
doing
any
one
any
harm
and
are
roused
and
made
to
walk
along
what
new
rules
have
they
got
for
us
disturbing
the
dead
you
ve
only
just
found
your
earth
when
up
you
must
be
and
unsteady
on
his
feet
the
muzhik
continued
to
pour
out
his
coarse
abuse
when
he
saw
trirodov
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
went
straight
to
him
he
was
blindly
conscious
of
being
in
the
presence
of
a
stranger
and
an
enemy
and
he
wished
to
destroy
him
kirsha
trembled
and
grew
pale
he
clung
to
his
father
in
fear
the
quiet
boy
retaining
his
tranquil
sadness
stood
at
their
side
like
an
angel
on
guard
the
muzhik
touched
the
enchanted
line
pain
and
terror
transpierced
him
he
stared
with
his
dead
eyes
but
quickly
lowered
them
as
he
was
unable
to
withstand
the
look
of
the
living
he
fell
with
his
forehead
to
the
ground
just
beyond
the
line
and
begged
for
mercy
go
said
trirodov
the
muzhik
rose
to
his
feet
and
scampered
away
but
he
soon
paused
and
again
burst
out
into
abuse
then
ran
farther
two
lean
poorly
dressed
boys
with
green
faces
walked
by
the
rags
which
bound
their
feet
hung
loosely
one
of
them
said
do
you
understand
they
tormented
me
tyrannized
over
me
i
ran
away
and
they
caught
me
again
i
had
no
strength
left
i
went
to
the
garret
and
strangled
myself
i
don
t
know
what
i
shall
get
for
it
the
other
green
boy
replied
as
for
me
i
was
beaten
with
salted
rods
my
hands
are
quite
yes
you
are
lucky
said
the
first
boy
enviously
you
will
get
a
little
golden
wreath
but
what
will
happen
to
me
i
will
entreat
the
angels
the
archangels
the
cherubim
and
the
seraphim
for
you
give
me
but
your
full
name
and
my
sin
is
quite
a
big
one
and
my
name
is
mitka
sosipatrov
from
nizhniya
don
t
be
afraid
said
the
birched
boy
as
soon
as
they
let
me
in
to
the
upper
chambers
i
will
at
once
fall
at
the
feet
of
the
virgin
mary
until
you
are
yes
do
me
this
great
kirsha
stood
pale
his
eyes
sparkled
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
kept
on
repeating
mamma
come
to
me
mamma
come
to
me
a
radiant
apparition
suddenly
appeared
in
the
throng
and
kirsha
throbbed
with
joy
kirsha
s
mother
passed
by
all
white
all
lovely
all
gentle
she
turned
her
tranquil
eyes
upon
her
dear
ones
and
whispered
i
will
kirsha
transported
with
a
quiet
joy
stood
motionless
his
eyes
gleamed
like
the
eyes
of
the
quiet
angel
who
stood
there
on
guard
again
the
dead
throng
moved
on
a
governor
passed
by
all
his
figure
breathed
might
and
majesty
yet
hardly
awake
he
grumbled
make
way
for
the

with

can
not

me
what

hungry

say
he
appeared
as
it
were
to
awaken
at
these
words
he
looked
around
him
and
said
in
great
astonishment
as
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
a
strange
disorder
how
did
i
get
into
this
crowd
where
is
the
police
then
he
suddenly
bawled
out
let
the
cossacks
come
in
response
to
the
governor
s
cry
a
detachment
of
cossacks
came
flying
without
noticing
trirodov
and
the
children
they
swept
along
past
them
and
savagely
flourished
their
the
dead
pressed
from
behind
by
the
cossacks
horses
became
a
confused
wavering
mass
and
answered
with
malignant
laughter
to
the
blows
of
the

their
lifeless
bodies
the
grey
witch
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
shook
with
her
hideous
creaking
laughter
chapter
xiv
elisaveta
dressed
herself
up
as
a
boy
she
loved
to
do
this
and
she
did
it
quite
often
so
tedious
is
the
monotony
of
our
lives
that
even
a
change
of
dress
furnishes
a
diversion
elisaveta
put
on
a
white
with
a
blue
collar
and
blue
which
revealed
the
beauty
and
grace
of
her
sunburnt
lower
limbs
she
put
on
a
cap
took
a
and
went
to
the
river
elisaveta
looked
like
a
rather
tall
stripling
of
fourteen
in
this
dress
it
was
quiet
and
bright
on
the
river
s
bank
elisaveta
sat
down
on
a
stone
at
the
edge
lowered
her
feet
into
the
water
and
watched
the
float
a
appeared
elisaveta
looked
intently
and
saw
that
it
contained
stchemilov
the
latter
called
out
i
say
my
lad
if
you
belong
here
can
you
tell
me
if
then
he
paused
because
elisaveta
was
laughing
well
who
would
have
thought
it
comrade
elisaveta
you
didn
t
recognize
me
comrade
asked
elisaveta
with
a
merry
laugh
as
she
approached
the
where
stchemilov
was
already
fastening
his
boat
i
must
confess
that
i
didn
t
know
you
at
once
he
replied
as
he
pressed
her
hand
warmly
i
have
come
for
you
we
are
to
hold
our
mass
is
it
really
asked
elisaveta
she
grew
cold
from
agitation
and
confusion
as
she
recalled
that
she
had
promised
to
speak
that
evening
yes
said
stchemilov
i
hope
you
haven
t
changed
your
mind
you
will
speak
eh
i
thought
it
was
to
be
she
replied
just
wait
a
moment
i
ll
get
a
small
bundle
of
clothes
i
will
change
at
your
she
quickly
and
gaily
tripped
up
the
bank
stchemilov
whistled
as
he
sat
waiting
in
the
boat
elisaveta
soon
reappeared
and
deftly
jumped
into
the
boat
it
was
necessary
to
row
past
the
whole
length
of
the
town
no
one
on
either
bank
recognized
elisaveta
in
her
boy
s
attire
stchemilov
s
house
a
cabin
in
the
middle
of
a
vegetable
garden
stood
on
a
steep
bank
of
the
river
just
along
the
edge
of
the
town
no
one
had
yet
arrived
at
the
house
elisaveta
picked
up
a
periodical
which
lay
on
the
table
and
asked
tell
me
comrade
how
do
you
like
these
verses
stchemilov
looked
at
the
periodical
open
at
a
page
which
contained
trirodov
s
verses
he
smiled
and
said
what
shall
i
say
his
revolutionary
poems
are
not
bad
nowadays
however
everybody
writes
them
as
for
his
other
works
they
are
not
written
about
us
noblemen
s
delights
are
not
for
it
s
a
long
time
since
i
ve
been
here
said
elisaveta
what
a
mess
you
ve
got
a
house
without
a
mistress
answered
stchemilov
rather
confused
elisaveta
began
to
put
things
in
order
and
to
clean
and
to
scrub
she
moved
about
with
agile
grace
stchemilov
admired
her
graceful
limbs
it
was
fascinating
to
watch
the
play
of
the
muscles
under
the
brown
skin
of
her
calves
he
exclaimed
in
a
clear
almost
ecstatic
voice
how
graceful
you
are
elisaveta
like
a
statue
i
never
saw
such
arms
and
i
feel
embarrassed
comrade
aleksei
you
praise
me
to
my
eyes
as
if
i
were
a
charming
piece
of
stchemilov
suddenly
flushed
with
embarrassment
his
habitual
appeared
to
have
left
him
unexpectedly
he
breathed
heavily
and
stammered
out
in
confusion
comrade
elisaveta
you
are
a
fine
person
don
t
be
offended
at
my
words
i
love
you
i
know
that
for
you
social
inequality
is
a
silly
thing
and
you
know
that
for
me
your
money
is
of
no
account
now
if
i
am
not
repugnant
to
you
elisaveta
stood
before
him
calm
and
yet
sad
and
as
she
dried
her
hands
grown
red
from
the
cold
water
with
a
towel
she
said
quietly
forgive
me
comrade
aleksei
you
are
right
about
my
views
but
i
love
she
herself
did
not
know
how
these
words
came
to
be
spoken
love
another
so
unexpectedly
the
secret
of
her
heart
revealed
itself
in
superficial
words
but
did
he
love
her
that
other
one
they
were
both
flustered
stchemilov
strove
heroically
to
control
his
agitation
as
he
looked
with
his
confused
eyes
into
her
clear
blue
ones
he
said
forgive
me
elisaveta
and
forget
what
i
have
said
i
didn
t
guess
right
that
time
and
did
the
wrong
thing
i
didn
t
think
that
you
d
love
him
don
t
be
angry
at
me
and
don
t
despise
enough
aleksei
said
elisaveta
tenderly
you
know
how
i
respect
you
we
are
friends
give
me
your
stchemilov
gave
her
hand
a
tight
comradely
pressure
then
bent
down
and
kissed
it
elisaveta
drew
nearer
to
him
and
kissed
his
lips
with
a
tranquil
innocent
delicious
kiss
such
as
a
sister
gives
a
brother
then
she
snatched
up
her
bundle
and
ran
into
the
passage
one
of
the
doors
of
which
led
to
a
small
storeroom
where
the
literature
was
kept
in
a
trunk
under
the
floor
she
ran
into
kiril
on
the
way
is
aleksei
home
my
lad
yes
said
elisaveta
enter
comrade
when
kiril
heard
the
familiar
voice
and
lifting
his
eyes
saw
plaits
of
hair
wound
around
the
lad
s
head
he
was
astonished
he
was
very
much
embarrassed
upon
recognizing
elisaveta
she
hid
herself
behind
the
door
of
the
storeroom
while
kiril
blundered
for
a
long
time
in
the
dark
hall
unable
in
his
confusion
to
find
the
door
others
began
to
come
in
there
was
the
bodeyev
instructor
voronok
of
the
town
school
and
the
imported
orator
who
came
accompanied
by
alkina
elisaveta
was
attired
by
now
in
a
simple
dark
blue
dress
it
s
time
to
start
said
stchemilov
once
seated
in
the
the
members
of
the
party
became
silent
and
slightly
nervous
only
the
was
perfectly
calm
he
was
used
to
it
he
looked
indifferently
out
of
his
spectacles
now
one
side
now
the
other
and
told
bits
of
news
while
smoking
one
cigarette
after
another
he
was
young
tall
and
he
had
a
lean
face
long
smooth
hair
and
a
scant
beard
his
flat
round
cap
reddish
in
the
sun
gave
him
the
look
of
an
artisan
it
had
begun
to
grow
dark
by
the
time
they
disembarked
at
the
appointed
place
there
was
still
a
to
go
through
the
wood
on
foot
the
evening
twilight
seemed
oppressed
under
the
eternal
vaults
of
the
wood
it
hummed
and
rustled
with
barely
audible
noises
and
the
sad
whisperings
of
stealthy
beings
they
gathered
at
last
in
a
large
glade
in
the
midst
of
a
tall
dense
wood
the
moon
was
already
high
in
the
sky
and
the
black
shadows
of
the
trees
crept
across
half
of
the
glade
the
trees
were
intensely
still
and
pensive
as
if
they
wished
to
listen
to
the
words
of
these
people
who
had
collected
at
their
feet
but
they
really
did
not
care
to
listen
they
had
their
own
life
and
were
indifferent
to
all
these
people
and
they
suffered
neither
joy
nor
sadness
at
sheltering
in
their
dark
shade
many
young
girls
who
were
in
love
with
the
dream
of
liberation
among
them
elisaveta
who
was
also
in
love
with
this
dream
and
who
created
for
it
a
temple
of
young
passion
and
embroidered
into
this
dream
s
design
the
image
of
a
living
man
in
a
mysterious
house
she
was
deliciously
in
love
and
painfully
agitated
by
the
sudden
acknowledgment
she
made
of
her
love
in
her
poignantly
sweet
words
i
love
in
the
dark
shade
of
the
trees
were
red
glimmering
cigarettes
and
pipes
the
odour
of
tobacco
mingled
with
the
fresh
nocturnal
coolness
and
gave
it
a
sweet
piquancy
piquant
also
in
the
nocturnal
stillness
were
the
sounds
of
the
young
eager
voices
and
these
people
had
no
concern
with
the
mystery
of
the
wood
made
audible
in
the
silence
the
people
behaved
as
if
they
were
at
home
they
sat
about
and
walked
and
met
each
other
and
chatted
sometimes
when
the
din
of
talk
grew
too
loud
the
leaders
of
the
meeting
uttered
their
warnings
then
the
voices
were
lowered
there
were
about
three
hundred
people
of
all
kinds
labouring
men
young
people
from
schools
young
jews
and
very
many
girls
all
the
young
jews
and
jewesses
of
the
town
had
come
they
were
agitated
more
than
the
rest
and
their
speech
nearly
always
passed
into
a
violent
commotion
they
awaited
so
much
they
hoped
so
passionately
they
were
so
painfully
in
love
with
the
dream
of
liberation
some
of
the
instructresses
from
trirodov
s
colony
were
also
here
among
them
the
sad
nadezhda
and
the
ecstatic
maria
there
were
quite
a
number
of
schoolboys
and
schoolgirls
present
these
tried
to
act
at
ease
to
show
that
it
was
not
their
first
occasion
of
the
sort
there
were
also
many
college
students
both
men
and
women
the
young
were
burning
with
joyous
unrest
but
all
who
had
gathered
were
intensely
agitated
it
was
the
sweet
agitation
of
their
dream
of
liberation
how
tenderly
and
how
passionately
they
were
in
love
with
it
and
in
more
than
one
young
heart
virginal
passion
flowed
together
with
the
dream
of
liberation
young
passionate
love
flamed
with
a
great
fire
in
the
joy
of
liberation
making
one
of
liberation
and
love
of
revolt
and
sacrifice
of
wine
and
blood
what
delicious
mystery
in
love
thirsting
and
yielding
and
more
than
one
pair
of
eyes
sparkled
at
the
sight
of
a
beloved
image
and
more
than
one
pair
of
lips
whispered
and
he
s
here
and
she
s
here
in
the
shade
under
the
trees
where
indiscreet
glances
could
not
penetrate
impatient
lips
met
in
a
quick
timid
kiss
and
the
first
words
were
i
m
not
late
comrade
no
comrade
natalya
you
are
in
let
us
go
over
there
comrade
the
names
were
pronounced
tenderly
a
man
in
a
cap
black
shirt
and
high
boots
walked
up
to
elisaveta
he
had
a
small
black
beard
and
moustache
and
his
face
which
was
both
familiar
and
unfamiliar
had
something
in
it
that
stirred
her
he
exclaimed
elisaveta
you
don
t
recognize
me
she
recognized
him
at
once
by
his
voice
a
warmth
suffused
her
she
laughed
and
said
joyously
i
knew
you
by
your
voice
alone
your
beard
and
moustache
make
you
wholly
they
are
glued
on
explained
trirodov
they
conversed
he
heard
some
one
whisper
behind
his
back
that
is
comrade
elisaveta
she
s
considered
the
first
beauty
in
our
trirodov
was
for
some
reason
overjoyed
at
these
words
partly
because
elisaveta
heard
them
and
blushed
so
furiously
that
even
the
dim
moonlight
could
not
hide
her
blushes
a
few
detectives
had
also
managed
to
find
their
way
here
and
there
was
even
one
provocateur
these
chattels
alone
knew
that
the
police
had
information
about
the
meeting
and
that
the
wood
would
shortly
be
encircled
by
the
cossacks
conversations
were
kept
up
among
small
groups
for
some
time
before
the
meeting
opened
the
agitators
discussed
matters
with
labouring
men
who
were
not
in
the
party
the
more
interesting
people
were
introduced
to
the
invited
speaker
stchemilov
s
loud
voice
rang
out
comrades
attention
i
propose
comrade
abram
as
agreed
agreed
came
suppressed
voices
from
every
side
comrade
abram
took
his
place
on
a
high
stump
of
a
tree
the
speeches
began
elisaveta
was
nervous
until
it
came
her
turn
to
speak
she
was
troubled
with
pain
and
fear
because
she
knew
that
trirodov
would
hear
her
proud
brave
watchwords
and
bold
instructions
were
heard
the
provocateur
also
made
a
speech
he
urged
them
to
an
immediate
armed
revolt
some
one
s
voice
called
out
comrades
this
man
s
a
provocateur
there
was
a
commotion
the
provocateur
shouted
something
in
his
defence
he
was
promptly
jostled
out
then
stchemilov
spoke
he
was
followed
by
the
invited
orator
elisaveta
s
agitation
grew
but
when
the
chairman
said
comrade
elisaveta
the
word
belongs
to
you
she
suddenly
became
calm
and
having
ascended
the
high
stump
that
served
as
the
platform
began
to
speak
her
deep
measured
voice
carried
far
some
one
seemed
to
echo
it
in
the
wood
it
was
like
a
fantastic
restless
din
a
being
beloved
by
her
and
near
to
her
sat
there
and
listened
her
beloved
near
comrades
also
listened
hundreds
of
attentive
eyes
followed
her
and
the
dear
friendly
looks
converging
like
lances
under
a
shield
held
her
very
high
in
the
pure
atmosphere
of
happiness
the
sweet
moments
of
joy
passed
by
like
a
short
dream
she
ended
her
speech
and
came
down
among
the
audience
where
she
was
received
with
flattering
comments
and
strong
pressures
of
the
hand
sometimes
it
must
be
confessed
a
little
i
say
comrade
you
ll
break
my
hand
how
strong
you
are
and
his
face
would
also
break
into
a
joyous
smile
the
speeches
ended
the
songs
began
the
wood
with
proud
brave
words
with
a
song
of
freedom
and
revolt
suddenly
the
song
stopped
short
a
confused
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
some
one
shouted
the
cossacks
some
one
shouted
run
comrades
some
one
ran
some
one
shouted
be
calm
comrades
the
cossacks
had
hid
themselves
in
the
wood
a
couple
of
versts
from
the
meeting
many
of
them
had
managed
to
take
several
drinks
as
they
sat
around
their
bonfires
they
began
to
sing
a
gay
noisy
indecent
song
but
their
officers
enjoined
silence
a
spy
came
running
he
whispered
something
to
the
colonel
soon
a
command
was
given
the
cossacks
jumped
quickly
on
their
horses
and
rode
away
leaving
the
bonfire
behind
them
the
dry
faggots
and
the
grass
smouldered
a
long
time
the
forest
caught
fire
what
s
the
matter
asked
elisaveta
some
one
whispered
quickly
do
you
hear
it
s
the
cossacks
i
wonder
which
side
they
are
coming
from
it
s
hard
to
tell
which
way
to
they
are
coming
from
town
said
some
one
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
go
towards
the
leaders
began
to
give
orders
comrades
be
calm
scatter
as
quickly
as
possible
don
t
jostle
the
road
to
dubky
is
a
number
of
horses
heads
suddenly
appeared
from
among
the
trees
quiet
close
to
elisaveta
and
their
dumb
but
good
eyes
looked
on
incomprehensibly
the
crowd
of
young
people
began
to
run
and
carried
elisaveta
along
with
them
she
was
seized
by
a
feeling
of
stupor
she
thought
what
s
the
use
of
running
they
ll
overtake
us
and
drive
us
wherever
they
but
she
had
not
enough
strength
to
pause
they
were
all
running
and
she
with
them
another
detachment
of
cossacks
appeared
in
front
of
them
cries
and
wails
went
up
from
the
crowd
which
began
to
scatter
in
all
directions
the
cossacks
came
on
as
it
were
in
a
broad
chain
many
managed
to
break
through
some
with
faces
and
torn
clothes
the
others
were
driven
forward
from
the
rear
and
the
sides
and
gradually
became
a
compact
mass
it
was
evident
that
the
cossacks
were
trying
to
get
the
crowd
into
the
middle
of
the
glade
those
who
had
broken
through
the
ring
at
the
very
beginning
had
some
hope
of
escape
there
were
about
a
hundred
people
in
the
ring
they
were
driven
towards
the
town
and
those
who
tried
to
escape
were
lashed
with
the
a
few
shots
resounded
in
the
distance
the
provocateur
fired
the
first
shot
into
the
air
this
aroused
the
anger
of
the
cossacks
who
began
to
shoot
at
those
who
ran
elisaveta
and
alkina
managed
to
escape
the
first
ring
together
but
they
could
hear
all
around
them
the
cries
of
the
cossacks
they
paused
and
pressed
close
to
an
old
oak
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
they
were
joined
by
trirodov
follow
me
he
said
to
them
i
think
i
can
find
a
less
dangerous
what
has
become
of
our
invited
speaker
asked
alkina
don
t
worry
about
that
was
the
impatient
reply
he
was
the
first
to
be
attended
to
he
s
out
of
danger
now
you
d
better
go
on
he
walked
confidently
through
the
bushes
and
they
followed
him
the
sounds
made
by
the
patrols
of
cossacks
were
heard
on
every
side
suddenly
the
runners
were
confronted
by
the
figure
of
a
cossack
who
stepped
out
from
the
bushes
he
aimed
his
at
elisaveta
but
she
falling
headlong
escaped
the
brunt
of
the
blow
the
cossack
bent
down
caught
elisaveta
by
her
plait
of
hair
and
began
to
drag
her
after
him
elisaveta
cried
out
from
pain
trirodov
pulled
out
a
revolver
and
shot
him
almost
without
taking
aim
the
cossack
cried
out
and
let
his
victim
go
all
three
then
made
their
way
through
the
bushes
a
deep
hollow
cut
their
progress
short
well
we
are
almost
out
of
danger
here
said
trirodov
they
lowered
themselves
almost
rolled
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
hollow
their
faces
and
hands
bore
scratches
and
their
clothes
were
torn
on
one
of
the
sloping
sides
of
the
hollow
they
found
a
deep
recess
made
by
the
rains
and
now
obscured
by
the
bushes
and
here
they
hid
themselves
presently
we
ll
make
for
the
said
trirodov
we
are
quite
close
to
suddenly
they
heard
the
crackle
of
breaking
twigs
above
them
followed
by
a
and
outcries
a
running
figure
defined
itself
in
the
dark
kiril
called
elisaveta
in
a
whisper
come
kiril
heard
her
and
threw
himself
through
the
bushes
in
the
direction
of
the
elisaveta
could
now
see
quite
close
to
her
his
fatigued
desperate
eyes
there
was
a
loud
near
report
of
a
revolver
kiril
reeled
there
was
the
sound
of
breaking
twigs
as
he
fell
heavily
and
rolled
down
the
hollow
presently
a
running
cossack
came
down
precipitately
from
above
he
brushed
so
closely
past
them
that
a
twig
caught
by
his
body
struck
alkina
s
shoulder
but
alkina
did
not
stir
pale
slender
and
calm
she
stood
tightly
pressing
her
body
against
the
almost
perpendicular
wall
of
their
refuge
the
cossack
bent
over
kiril
examined
him
attentively
then
muttered
as
he
straightened
himself
well
there
s
no
breath
left
in
him
you
re
done
for
my
clever
then
he
turned
to
climb
back
again
when
the
rustle
of
the
parted
bushes
ceased
trirodov
said
now
we
must
walk
carefully
along
this
hollow
until
we
come
to
the
river
there
is
a
bend
in
the
river
here
in
the
direction
of
the
town
we
are
bound
to
get
somewhere
almost
across
from
my
place
then
we
must
find
our
way
to
the
other
side
somehow
or
slowly
and
cautiously
they
made
their
way
through
the
thick
growths
of
the
hollow
they
walked
in
the
dark
trirodov
and
the
two
with
him
his
chance
one
and
his
fated
one
sent
him
by
the
two
moirae
aisa
and
ananke
the
bushes
became
moist
and
a
fresh
breeze
blew
from
the
river
then
alkina
came
close
to
trirodov
and
whispered
to
him
if
you
are
glad
that
she
loves
you
tell
me
and
i
will
share
your
trirodov
pressed
her
hand
warmly
the
quiet
dim
river
lay
before
them
beyond
it
the
labours
and
dangers
of
life
created
by
the
dream
of
liberation
awaited
them
soon
the
mist
would
rise
above
the
river
under
the
cold
and
witching
moon
soon
the
misty
veil
of
fantasy
would
lighten
the
tedious
and
commonplace
life
and
behind
the
veil
of
mist
there
would
rise
in
dim
outlines
another
kind
of
life
creative
and
unattainable
chapter
xv
that
night
the
streets
of
skorodozh
were
alive
with
noises
which
gradually
died
away
the
frightened
townsmen
sprang
from
their
warm
beds
and
peering
through
the
blinds
into
the
dark
streets
saw
those
who
had
been
caught
in
the
woods
led
away
in
the
custody
of
the
cossacks
then
when
the
stamp
of
horses
hoofs
and
the
hum
of
human
voices
subsided
the
residents
quietly
went
back
to
their
beds
and
were
soon
asleep
lady
godiva
would
have
been
highly
pleased
with
such
modest
people
they
looked
yet
did
not
show
themselves
and
did
not
hinder
they
went
to
bed
again
and
muttered
something
to
their
wives
the
bourgeois
grumbled
they
won
t
let
you
sleep
the
horses
hoofs
make
such
a
noise
they
might
employ
bicycles
instead
of
the
night
passed
like
a
nightmare
for
many
it
seemed
to
grip
all
life
with
a
cold
apprehensiveness
and
burdened
one
s
soul
with
a
hate
towards
the
earthly
life
which
suffered
agony
from
its
bondage
to
the
flaming
exultant
dragon
why
did
he
exult
was
it
because
we
beings
of
the
earth
are
evil
and
cruel
and
love
to
torment
to
see
drops
of
blood
and
tears
our
dark
earthly
nature
is
suffused
with
a
cruel
voluptuousness
such
is
the
imperfection
of
the
human
breed
that
a
single
human
vessel
contains
all
the
deepest
ecstasies
of
love
and
all
the
lowest
delights
of
lust
and
the
mixture
is
poisoned
with
shame
and
with
pain
and
with
the
desire
for
shame
and
pain
from
one
fountain
come
both
the
gladdening
raptures
and
the
gladdening
lusts
of
the
passions
we
torment
others
only
because
it
gives
us
joy
after
the
agonies
on
the
way
from
the
wood
after
a
search
had
been
made
many
of
the
prisoners
were
dispatched
to
prison
others
were
set
free
a
restless
sluggish
and
unfriendly
morning
rose
over
the
city
from
the
wood
just
beyond
the
town
came
the
odour
of
a
forest
fire
the
news
about
the
two
dead
victims
kiril
and
another
workman
kliukin
a
family
man
soon
spread
their
comrades
were
excited
the
corpses
had
been
taken
to
the
mortuary
of
the
town
hospital
a
large
crowd
grave
silent
and
resolute
in
mood
had
gathered
quite
early
near
the
mortuary
it
mostly
consisted
of
labouring
men
and
their
wives
and
children
the
large
square
in
front
of
the
hospital
with
its
dirty
unpaved
spots
its
trampled
grass
its
grey
gloomy
little
shops
appeared
oppressed
by
an
atmosphere
of
early
morning
fatigue
the
slant
rays
of
the
rising
dragon
veiled
with
a
light
mist
fell
upon
the
scowling
faces
of
the
crowd
as
indifferently
as
upon
the
fence
or
the
closed
gates
the
ancient
dragon
is
not
our
sun
the
faces
of
those
who
stood
near
the
closed
gates
were
scowling
no
one
was
permitted
to
enter
the
hospital
within
preparations
were
going
on
for
a
secret
burial
of
the
victims
tumultuous
voices
of
anger
rose
in
the
crowd
a
detachment
of
cossacks
soon
appeared
on
the
scene
they
came
on
quickly
and
paused
near
the
crowd
the
beautiful
smooth
horses
trembled
sensitively
the
riders
were
handsome
and
their
black
hair
not
cut
in
the
military
fashion
was
visible
from
under
their
high
hats
the
women
in
the
crowd
looked
at
them
now
and
then
with
involuntary
admiration
the
tumult
increased
the
crowd
continued
to
grow
the
whole
square
was
alive
with
people
there
seemed
to
be
imminent
danger
of
a
bloody
collision
trirodov
went
that
morning
to
the
chief
of
the
rural
police
and
to
the
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
he
wished
to
convince
them
that
a
secret
burial
would
only
add
to
the
workers
excitement
the
chief
listened
to
him
in
a
dull
way
and
kept
on
repeating
impossible
i
can
t
he
gazed
down
persistently
this
caused
his
neck
to
look
tight
poured
out
like
copper
and
he
kept
on
turning
his
ring
round
his
finger
as
if
it
were
a
talisman
protecting
him
from
hostile
calumny
the
colonel
of
the
gendarmes
proved
easier
to
deal
with
in
the
end
trirodov
succeeded
in
obtaining
an
order
for
the
surrender
of
the
bodies
of
the
dead
men
to
their
families
the
chief
of
the
rural
police
arrived
in
the
square
the
crowd
greeted
him
with
discordant
and
angry
cries
he
stood
up
in
his
trap
and
motioned
with
his
hand
every
one
grew
silent
he
addressed
them
would
you
like
to
bury
them
yourselves
very
well
you
shall
have
them
only
be
careful
that
nothing
happens
which
shouldn
t
happen
in
any
case
the
cossacks
will
be
present
in
an
emergency
and
now
i
will
see
that
the
bodies
of
your
comrades
are
delivered
to
chapter
xvi
the
sun
was
already
high
when
elisaveta
awoke
she
quickly
recalled
all
that
happened
the
night
before
she
took
but
little
time
in
dressing
and
urged
by
a
suppressed
excitement
was
soon
on
the
way
to
trirodov
in
her
carriage
trirodov
met
her
at
the
gates
he
was
returning
from
town
and
he
told
her
briefly
about
his
conferences
with
the
authorities
elisaveta
said
resolutely
i
want
to
see
the
family
of
the
dead
i
don
t
know
where
they
live
we
shall
have
to
see
voronok
first
he
has
all
the
shall
we
find
him
at
home
now
i
think
so
said
trirodov
if
he
s
at
home
we
ll
all
start
they
drove
off
the
dusty
road
trailed
behind
the
rapid
wheels
and
revealed
vistas
of
depressing
commonplaceness
the
light
dust
stirred
by
the
wheels
into
the
sultry
air
trailed
behind
the
carriage
like
a
long
serpent
the
high
flaming
dragon
looked
down
from
his
inaccessible
sky
with
furious
eyes
upon
the
impoverished
earth
there
was
a
thirst
for
blood
in
the
hot
glister
of
his
rays
and
there
was
a
soaring
exultation
because
men
had
shed
some
priceless
drops
of
the
wine
of
life
in
the
midst
of
these
open
spaces
trirodov
drawn
at
this
moment
into
the
crowded
town
life
was
addressing
his
companion
in
dull
everyday
words
they
searched
many
houses
early
this
morning
they
found
a
great
deal
of
literature
at
stchemilov
s
he
s
been
he
also
repeated
the
rumour
of
whippings
at
the
elisaveta
was
silent
voronok
s
house
was
situated
in
a
very
convenient
place
somewhere
between
the
centre
of
the
town
and
the
factory
section
this
house
had
many
visitors
because
voronok
was
an
assiduous
worker
in
the
local
social
democratic
party
his
chief
function
was
to
carry
on
propaganda
among
the
working
men
and
the
young
and
incidentally
to
instil
into
them
party
views
and
a
true
understanding
of
the
aims
of
the
working
classes
young
boys
used
to
come
to
voronok
his
pupils
from
the
town
school
and
these
brought
their
comrades
and
acquaintances
with
them
those
whom
they
met
at
home
or
by
chance
they
were
for
the
most
part
charming
sincere
and
intelligent
youngsters
but
very
dishevelled
and
very
voronok
taught
them
very
heartily
and
with
good
results
they
assimilated
his
teachings
a
sympathy
towards
the
working
proletariat
a
hate
towards
the
satiated
bourgeois
a
consciousness
of
the
irreconcilability
of
the
interests
of
the
two
classes
and
a
few
random
facts
from
history
the
ragamuffins
from
the
town
school
invariably
opened
every
visit
to
voronok
by
complaining
against
the
school
rules
and
the
inspector
they
complained
chiefly
about
trifles
they
would
say
with
an
injured
air
they
compel
us
to
wear
official
badges
upon
our
they
treat
us
as
if
we
were
little
they
brand
us
so
that
every
one
may
know
that
we
are
the
boys
of
the
town
they
force
us
to
cut
our
hair
why
should
our
hair
worry
them
voronok
sympathized
with
them
fully
this
helped
him
to
keep
them
in
a
state
of
revolt
their
no
less
unkempt
friends
who
did
not
go
to
school
also
found
something
to
complain
about
if
not
against
their
parents
then
against
the
police
indeed
against
anything
that
occurred
to
them
but
their
complaints
did
not
contain
quite
that
poison
and
steadiness
which
was
instilled
into
the
schoolboys
with
all
the
force
of
a
school
voronok
used
to
give
both
classes
pamphlets
that
cost
a
kopeck
and
were
intensely
strict
in
their
party
purity
the
younger
of
the
working
men
also
used
to
come
to
voronok
s
house
there
were
still
others
a
ragged
grumbling
lot
who
appeared
to
carry
an
air
of
eternal
injury
with
them
as
if
they
had
lost
all
capacity
for
smiling
and
jesting
voronok
took
great
pains
to
read
the
pamphlets
with
them
and
to
explain
to
them
anything
that
was
not
especially
clear
regular
hours
were
allotted
for
these
readings
and
conversations
by
such
means
voronok
succeeded
in
developing
the
desired
mood
in
his
visitors
all
the
party
shibboleths
were
assimilated
by
them
quickly
and
thoroughly
he
also
gave
them
books
for
home
reading
many
used
to
buy
this
literature
occasionally
in
this
manner
a
flood
of
books
and
pamphlets
continually
poured
through
voronok
s
house
sometimes
he
selected
whole
libraries
and
sent
them
by
trustworthy
people
through
the
villages
elisaveta
and
trirodov
found
voronok
at
home
he
did
not
much
resemble
a
party
workman
he
was
gracious
spoke
little
and
produced
the
impression
of
a
reserved
man
he
always
wore
starched
linen
a
high
collar
a
fashionable
tie
and
a
bowler
hat
he
had
his
hair
trimmed
short
and
his
beard
was
most
neatly
brushed
i
will
go
with
you
with
pleasure
said
voronok
amiably
he
seized
his
thin
cane
put
on
his
bowler
hat
took
a
cursory
glance
of
himself
in
the
mirror
and
said
again
i
m
ready
but
perhaps
you
d
like
to
rest
they
declined
and
the
three
of
them
started
off
the
painful
silence
of
the
bright
streets
hovered
about
them
stealthily
and
expectantly
they
seemed
strangers
among
these
wooden
huts
depressing
fences
and
the
tottering
little
bridges
they
wanted
to
ask
why
are
we
going
but
this
only
seemed
to
bring
them
closer
and
to
make
the
quick
beats
of
their
hearts
more
friendly
the
whole
picture
of
the
life
of
the
poor
was
here
in
all
its
sordidness
dirty
malicious
children
played
here
and
abused
each
other
and
wrangled
a
drunkard
reeled
grey
buckets
swung
on
a
grey
wooden
yoke
across
the
shoulders
of
a
grey
woman
in
a
worn
grey
dress
there
was
everyday
commonplaceness
in
the
poverty
of
the
house
where
lay
the
hastily
prepared
yellow
corpse
a
woman
stood
at
its
head
and
wailed
quietly
and
ceaselessly
three
pale
children
came
in
and
looked
at
the
visitors
their
gaze
was
at
once
strange
and
stupid
neither
joyous
nor
sad
but
dulled
for
ever
elisaveta
went
up
to
the
woman
the
blooming
rosy
graceful
girl
stood
at
the
side
of
the
pale
woman
and
was
quietly
saying
something
to
her
the
latter
was
nodding
her
head
and
crooning
unnecessary
belated
words
trirodov
turned
quietly
to
voronok
is
any
money
needed
voronok
whispered
back
no
his
comrades
will
bury
him
we
ll
make
a
collection
among
ourselves
afterwards
the
family
will
need
some
the
day
of
the
funeral
arrived
the
factories
stopped
work
there
was
a
clear
sky
and
under
it
the
turbulent
crowd
the
light
currents
of
incense
streamed
in
the
air
and
its
sumptuous
aroma
mingled
with
the
light
odour
of
the
smoke
that
came
from
the
forest
cinders
the
schoolboys
struck
and
went
to
the
funeral
some
of
the
schoolgirls
came
also
the
more
timid
ones
remained
in
school
the
children
from
trirodov
s
colony
decided
to
come
they
brought
two
wreaths
with
them
the
quiet
children
came
also
they
kept
by
themselves
and
were
silent
the
entire
town
police
were
present
at
the
funeral
even
police
from
outlying
districts
were
here
as
always
petty
provocateurs
lurked
among
the
crowd
the
crowd
moved
calmly
and
solemnly
above
it
the
wreaths
swung
the
red
flowers
glimmered
vividly
the
red
ribbons
fluttered
the
cossacks
rode
alongside
there
was
austerity
and
suspicion
in
their
looks
they
were
prepared
to
suppress
any
demonstration
the
chanting
of
a
prayer
could
be
heard
each
time
the
subsided
chant
was
renewed
the
cossacks
listened
with
great
intentness
no
it
was
only
the
prayer
again
elisaveta
and
trirodov
walked
with
the
crowd
behind
the
coffin
they
spoke
of
that
which
enraptures
those
who
seek
rapture
and
frightens
those
who
seek
repose
poignant
were
elisaveta
s
impressions
as
she
stepped
upon
the
sharp
cobblestones
of
the
dusty
littered
pavement
the
road
was
long
the
austere
harmony
was
kept
up
for
some
time
at
last
the
cemetery
was
reached
some
dejected
moments
were
passed
in
waiting
by
the
church
the
last
services
were
pronounced
hurriedly
the
cossacks
moved
about
in
bustling
fashion
and
as
before
formed
a
circle
around
the
throng
the
coffin
was
carried
out
of
the
church
the
wreaths
swung
once
more
above
the
crowd
which
moved
on
chanting
suddenly
the
women
s
lament
grew
louder
the
women
s
lament
above
the
grave
the
instructor
bodeyev
then
stood
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
he
began
in
his
but
voice
comrades
we
have
gathered
at
the
grave
of
our
brother
the
colonel
of
the
gendarmes
went
up
to
him
and
said
sternly
it
is
forbidden
i
must
ask
you
to
do
without
speeches
or
bodeyev
asked
in
astonishment
but
why
no
i
must
ask
you
not
to
it
is
forbidden
said
the
colonel
dryly
bodeyev
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
remarked
as
he
moved
away
i
submit
to
brute
to
the
law
the
officer
in
the
blue
uniform
corrected
him
sharply
the
dead
man
s
comrades
crowding
near
the
grave
followed
one
another
with
handfuls
of
soil
which
they
threw
on
the
coffin
the
damp
heavy
soil
struck
the
coffin
with
a
hollow
sound
the
grave
was
being
filled
up
every
one
stood
silently
and
as
silently
left
the
spot
then
suddenly
a
voice
was
heard
and
in
an
instant
the
whole
crowd
began
to
sing
words
of
a
proud
melancholy
revolutionary
song
the
cossacks
looked
on
morosely
the
command
was
given
the
cossacks
quickly
mounted
their
horses
the
singing
stopped
abruptly
once
outside
the
cemetery
gates
elisaveta
said
i
am
hungry
let
s
go
to
my
place
suggested
trirodov
thank
you
said
elisaveta
but
i
d
rather
go
to
some
trirodov
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
but
made
no
objection
he
understood
her
curiosity
the
tavern
was
crowded
and
noisy
trirodov
and
elisaveta
sat
down
near
the
window
at
a
small
table
covered
with
a
dirty
spotted
cloth
they
ordered
cold
meat
and
light
beer
at
one
of
the
tables
a
young
man
in
a
red
shirt
sat
drinking
he
was
in
a
boastful
mood
behind
his
ear
stuck
a
cigarette
the
fellow
intruded
upon
his
neighbours
and
shouted
who
s
drunk
well
who
asked
a
young
working
man
at
the
next
table
contemptuously
i
am
drunk
exclaimed
the
drunkard
in
the
red
shirt
and
who
am
i
do
you
know
eh
yes
who
are
you
what
sort
of
a
bird
are
you
asked
the
young
working
man
in
the
black
calico
blouse
derisively
i
am
borodulin
said
the
drunkard
and
there
was
an
expression
on
his
face
as
if
he
had
pronounced
a
famous
name
his
neighbours
roared
with
laughter
and
shouted
coarse
derisive
words
the
fellow
in
the
red
shirt
cried
angrily
what
do
you
think
is
borodulin
in
your
opinion
a
peasant
the
working
man
in
the
black
blouse
began
to
get
annoyed
his
lean
cheeks
grew
red
he
sprang
from
his
place
and
shouted
angrily
well
who
are
you
i
m
a
peasant
on
my
passport
an
army
reserve
man
but
that
s
not
all
i
assure

said
borodulin
well
who
then

repeated
the
young
working
man
angrily
as
he
took
a
step
towards
him
and
do
you
know
what
i
am
on
my
card
can
you
guess
asked
borodulin
he
blinked
and
tried
to
look
important
the
comrades
of
the
young
working
man
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
pursuing
his
inquiries
and
whispered
as
they
drew
him
away
don
t
waste
your
time
on
him
he
s
a
i
m
a
detective
that
s
what
i
am
said
borodulin
with
his
important
air
the
working
man
in
the
black
blouse
spat
contemptuously
and
walked
back
to
his
table
borodulin
went
on
you
think
i
m
out
of
my
senses
no
old
chap

the
men
at
the
neighbouring
tables
listened
to
him
and
exchanged
glances
borodulin
went
on
boasting
suppose
i
put
the
police
on
to
you
asked
a
merchant
at
one
of
the
middle
tables
angrily
his
small
black
eyes
sparkled
borodulin
burst
out
laughing
and
shouted
i
have
the
police
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
that
s
where
i
have
the
customers
grumbled
threats
were
heard
you
d
better
go
away
while
you
re
still
he
paid
his
bill
and
left
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
crowd
gathering
in
the
street
was
heard
from
the
window
elisaveta
and
trirodov
could
see
the
fellow
in
the
red
shirt
sauntering
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
street
only
a
few
paces
from
the
tavern
and
annoying
the
he
could
be
heard
shouting

acceded
to
his
request
borodulin
clutched
at
every
he
threw
off
the
men
s
caps
he
pinched
the
women
while
he
pulled
young
boys
by
the
ear
the
women
ran
from
him
shrieking
the
more
timid
men
also
ran
the
bolder
ones
paused
in
menacing
attitudes
these
borodulin
did
not
dare
to
molest
small
boys
ran
behind
him
in
a
crowd
laughing
and
hooting
borodulin
grumbled
you
d
better
look
out
do
you
know
who
i
am
well
who
are
you
asked
a
young
fellow
whom
he
jostled
you
re
a
pothouse
a
crowd
formed
round
them
their
faces
were
morose
and
unfriendly
borodulin
was
afraid
but
he
showed
a
bold
front
and
boasted
he
shouted
two
or
three
of
you
will
be
necessary
a
sudden
attack
was
made
upon
borodulin
a
young
robust
fellow
sprang
forward
from
the
crowd
with
a
shout
an
enormous
cobblestone
in
his
hand
what
s
this
dog
showing
his
teeth
for
he
hit
borodulin
on
the
head
with
the
stone
it
was
unfortunately
too
well
aimed
borodulin
fell
others
attacked
him
as
he
lay
there
the
workman
who
hit
him
with
the
stone
made
his
escape
elisaveta
and
trirodov
were
looking
out
of
the
window
trirodov
exclaimed
the
cossacks
the
people
in
the
street
scattered
in
all
directions
the
mutilated
corpse
lay
in
a
pool
of
blood
on
the
pavement
chapter
xvii
ostrov
caused
trirodov
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
more
than
once
trirodov
returned
to
the
earlier
circumstances
of
their
acquaintance
and
to
their
recent
meeting
at
skorodozh
the
week
having
elapsed
ostrov
paid
trirodov
another
visit
that
whole
week
ostrov
could
not
get
rid
of
his
confusion
and
uneasiness
the
details
of
his
meeting
with
trirodov
became
absurdly
entangled
in
his
memory
he
kept
on
forgetting
the
day
of
the
week
it
was
the
week
passed
rather
quickly
for
him
this
was
possibly
due
to
his
having
made
several
interesting
acquaintances
he
had
become
quite
a
noticeable
personage
about
town
ostrov
made
his
visit
late
on
tuesday
evening
he
was
received
at
once
and
led
into
a
chamber
on
the
ground
floor
trirodov
came
in
almost
immediately
not
a
little
astonished
he
asked
unwillingly
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
denis
alekseyevitch
i
ve
come
for
the
money
said
ostrov
gruffly
to
receive
the
promised
relief
at
your
bountiful
i
did
not
expect
you
until
wednesday
replied
trirodov
why
wednesday
when
tuesday
is
just
as
good
said
ostrov
with
a
savage
smile
or
do
you
find
it
so
hard
to
part
with
your
cash
have
you
become
a
bourgeois
giorgiy
sergeyevitch
trirodov
suddenly
appeared
to
recall
something
as
with
a
tinge
of
derision
in
his
smile
he
asked
i
beg
your
pardon
denis
alekseyevitch
i
thought
you
were
coming
as
was
arranged
i
haven
t
the
money
ready
for
ostrov
was
annoyed
his
broad
face
grew
dark
he
exclaimed
his
eyes
red
with
anger
you
asked
me
to
come
in
a
week
and
i
ve
come
in
a
week
you
don
t
expect
me
to
come
here
forty
times
do
you
i
have
other
business
you
ve
promised
me
the
money
and
so
hand
it
over
you
must
loosen
your
whether
you
like
it
or
he
grew
more
savage
with
every
word
in
the
end
he
struck
the
small
round
white
table
that
stood
on
slender
legs
in
front
of
him
with
his
stout
fist
trirodov
answered
calmly
it
is
now
tuesday
that
means
the
week
is
not
up
what
do
you
mean
it
isn
t
up
said
ostrov
i
came
to
see
you
on
tuesday
do
you
count
eight
days
in
a
week
in
the
french
fashion
you
won
t
come
off
so
you
came
here
on
wednesday
replied
trirodov
and
this
is
why
i
haven
t
the
money
ready
for
ostrov
was
unable
to
grasp
the
situation
he
looked
at
trirodov
with
some
perplexity
and
showed
his
irritation
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
that
you
haven
t
it
ready
why
should
you
get
it
ready
all
you
ve
got
to
do
is
to
take
it
out
of
your
safe
count
it
out
and
give
it
to
me
that
s
the
whole
method
of
procedure
it
isn
t
as
if
it
were
a
lot
of
money
it
s
a
mere
it
may
be
a
trifle
for
some
people
it
isn
t
at
all
a
trifle
for
me
said
trirodov
don
t
pretend
that
you
re
poor
some
one
might
think
you
were
a
forsaken
orphan
what
do
you
expect
us
to
believe
trirodov
rose
from
his
seat
looked
with
stern
intentness
into
ostrov
s
eyes
and
said
resolutely
in
a
word
i
can
t
give
you
the
money
try
to
come
here
about
this
ostrov
rose
involuntarily
from
his
chair
he
experienced
a
strange
sensation
as
if
he
were
being
lifted
from
his
seat
by
his
collar
and
forcibly
led
to
the
door
he
fired
his
parting
shot
only
don
t
think
that
you
can
pull
wool
over
my
eyes
i
m
not
the
sort
of
a
chap
whom
you
can
feed
on
his
small
eyes
gleamed
malignantly
his
broad
jaws
trembled
savagely
his
feet
seemed
to
carry
him
to
the
door
of
themselves
no
answered
trirodov
i
do
not
intend
to
fool
you
you
will
get
your
money
ostrov
came
at
the
same
hour
next
evening
this
time
he
was
led
into
trirodov
s
study
well
asked
ostrov
rather
impudently
do
you
mean
to
give
me
the
money
or
will
you
play
the
same
farce
once
more
trirodov
pulled
a
bundle
of
out
of
a
drawer
in
his
and
said
as
he
gave
them
to
ostrov
please
count
them
there
should
be
two
ostrov
whistled
and
said
gruffly
that
s
too
little
i
asked
for
much
that
s
all
you
ll
get
said
trirodov
resolutely
it
ought
to
last
you
quite
a
perhaps
you
will
add
a
trifle
said
ostrov
with
a
stupid
smile
i
can
t
said
trirodov
coldly
i
can
t
leave
town
on
this
money
said
ostrov
in
a
threatening
voice
trirodov
frowned
and
looked
sternly
at
ostrov
new
thoughts
began
to
take
shape
in
his
mind
and
he
said
you
won
t
find
it
to
your
advantage
to
remain
and
everything
you
do
here
will
be
known
to
very
well
i
ll
go
away
said
ostrov
with
a
stupid
smile
he
took
the
money
counted
it
carefully
and
put
it
into
his
greasy
pocket
he
was
about
to
take
his
leave
but
trirodov
detained
him
don
t
go
yet
we
ll
have
a
at
the
same
instant
a
quiet
boy
in
his
white
clothes
appeared
from
some
dark
corner
he
paused
behind
trirodov
s
chair
and
looked
at
ostrov
his
wide
dark
eyes
looking
out
of
his
pale
face
brought
ostrov
into
a
state
of
painful
dread
he
lowered
himself
slowly
into
the
chair
near
the
his
head
felt
giddy
then
a
strange
mood
of
nonchalance
and
submission
took
possession
of
him
his
face
bore
an
expression
of
apathetic
readiness
to
do
everything
that
he
might
be
commanded
to
do
by
some
one
stronger
than
himself
whose
will
had
conquered
his
trirodov
looked
attentively
at
ostrov
and
said
well
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
i
wish
to
hear
from
your
own
lips
what
you
are
doing
here
and
what
you
are
up
to
you
couldn
t
have
done
much
in
such
a
short
time
but
you
surely
have
found
out
something
speak
ostrov
sniggered
rather
stupidly
fidgeted
as
if
he
were
sitting
on
springs
and
said
very
well
i
ll
tell
you
something
interesting
and
won
t
charge
you
a
penny
for
trirodov
without
taking
off
his
heavy
fixed
gaze
from
ostrov
s
face
repeated
speak
the
quiet
boy
looked
with
his
eyes
full
of
intense
questioning
straight
into
ostrov
s
eyes
do
you
know
who
killed
the
chief
of
police
asked
ostrov
trirodov
was
silent
ostrov
s
whole
body
twitched
as
he
kept
up
his
absurd
sniggering
he
killed
him
and
went
away
went
on
ostrov
he
made
his
escape
by
taking
advantage
of
the
confusion
and
the
darkness
as
the
newspapers
would
say
the
police
have
not
caught
him
to
this
day
and
the
authorities
do
not
even
know
who
he
and
do
you
know
asked
trirodov
in
a
cold
deliberate
voice
i
know
but
i
won
t
tell
you
replied
ostrov
rather
venomously
you
shall
tell
me
said
trirodov
with
conviction
then
he
added
in
even
a
more
loud
determined
and
commanding
voice
tell
me
who
killed
the
chief
of
police
ostrov
fell
back
into
his
chair
his
red
face
became
tinged
with
a
sudden
grey
pallor
his
eyes
now
bloodshot
half
closed
like
those
of
a
prostrate
doll
with
the
eye
mechanism
in
its
stomach
there
was
witheredness
almost
lifelessness
in
ostrov
s
voice
your
friend
asked
trirodov
well
go
he
is
now
being
sought
for
went
on
ostrov
in
the
same
lifeless
way
why
did
poltinin
kill
the
chief
of
police
ostrov
resumed
his
stupid
snigger
and
said
it
s
a
matter
of
very
delicate
politics
that
means
it
simply
had
to
be
done
i
won
t
tell
you
why
indeed
i
couldn
t
tell
you
if
i
really
wished
to
i
don
t
know
myself
i
can
only
venture
to
guess
but
what
is
a
guess
worth
yes
said
trirodov
it
is
quite
true
that
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
know
this
continue
your
this
same
affair
said
ostrov
is
a
very
profitable
article
for
us
just
now
indeed
an
article
in
the
budget
as
they
why
trirodov
s
face
did
not
reveal
any
astonishment
as
ostrov
went
on
we
have
potseluytchikov
among
us
a
very
lively
a
thief
asked
trirodov
abruptly
ostrov
smiled
almost
consciously
and
said
not
exactly
a
thief
still
one
s
got
to
be
careful
with
him
an
able
man
in
his
ostrov
s
eyes
assumed
a
frankly
insolent

trirodov
asked
what
sort
of
relation
has
he
to
this
article
in
your
budget
we
send
him
out
to
the
rich
men
of
the
to
blackmail
them
asked
trirodov
ostrov
replied
with
complete
readiness
precisely
let
us
suppose
that
he
comes
to
moneybags
i
have
he
tells
him
a
thing
to
tell
you
in
confidence
a
thing
of
great
personal
interest
to
left
alone
with
moneybags
he
says
to
him
five
hundred
roubles
if
you
please
the
other
it
goes
without
saying
is
up
on
his
hind
legs
what
for
what
sort
of
demand
is
this
i
mean
what
i
say
says
the
other
chap
otherwise
he
says
i
will
put
your
eldest
son
in
gaol
i
can
prove
that
your
eldest
son
has
had
something
to
do
with
the
murder
of
the
gallant
chief
of
they
give
asked
trirodov
some
give
some
escort
you
out
of
the
door
replied
ostrov
a
lovely
crowd
observed
trirodov
contemptuously
and
what
may
you
be
planning
now
with
the
same
involuntary
obedience
ostrov
told
trirodov
how
their
company
was
conspiring
to
steal
a
ikon
from
a
neighbouring
monastery
the
plan
was
to
burn
the
ikon
and
to
sell
the
precious
stones
with
which
it
was
covered
it
was
a
difficult
affair
as
the
ikon
was
under
guard
but
ostrov
s
friends
were
counting
on
taking
advantage
of
one
of
the
summer
feasts
when
the
monks
escorting
distinguished
pilgrims
would
have
drunk
freely
the
thieves
had
still
a
month
in
which
to
make
preparations
for
the
theft
they
meant
to
make
use
of
this
time
by
becoming
friendly
with
the
monks
and
in
this
way
familiarize
themselves
with
all
the
conditions
trirodov
having
listened
without
interrupting
said
to
ostrov
forget
that
you
have
told
me
all
this
ostrov
gave
a
start
he
appeared
as
if
he
had
just
awakened
without
comprehending
the
causes
of
his
oppressive
confusion
he
bade
his
host
goodbye
and
left
trirodov
decided
that
the
bishop
of
the
local
diocese
must
be
warned
of
the
contemplated
theft
of
the
ikon
bishop
pelagius
lived
in
the
monastery
in
which
the
ikon
of
the
mother
of
god
so
revered
by
the
people
was
preserved
the
relics
of
an
old
sainted
monk
were
preserved
in
the
same
monastery
men
came
from
all
ends
of
russia
to
worship
these
holy
relics
that
was
why
this
monastery
was
considered
wealthy
trirodov
thought
for
a
long
time
as
to
how
he
might
best
inform
the
bishop
of
the
contemplated
theft
the
thought
of
writing
an
anonymous
letter
was
repugnant
to
him
he
decided
that
it
was
better
to
speak
to
the
bishop
in
person
or
to
write
him
a
letter
with
his
real
name
but
then
the
question
remained
as
to
how
to
explain
his
own
knowledge
of
the
conspiracy
he
himself
might
be
suspected
as
an
accomplice
of
the
criminals
as
it
was
the
local
townsmen
had
none
too
friendly
an
eye
for
trirodov
he
dreaded
entangling
himself
in
this
dark
affair
he
already
began
to
feel
vexed
with
himself
for
his
strange
curiosity
that
impelled
him
to
question
ostrov
about
his
affairs
it
would
have
been
better
perhaps
if
he
were
ignorant
of
the
conspiracy
in
any
case
trirodov
saw
clearly
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
maintain
silence
he
thought
that
the
dark
aspects
of
monastic
life
did
not
justify
the
evil
deed
planned
by
ostrov
s
companions
besides
the
consequences
of
this
deed
might
well
prove
very
dangerous
trirodov
decided
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
him
to
do
but
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
monastery
once
on
the
spot
he
thought
that
some
opportunity
of
informing
the
bishop
would
occur
to
him
but
as
this
visit
was
very
unpleasant
to
him
he
delayed
it
a
very
long
time
chapter
xviii
trirodov
at
last
realized
that
he
was
in
love
with
elisaveta
he
knew
too
well
the
nature
of
this
delicious
and
painful
emotion
it
had
come
again
and
once
more
filled
the
world
with
light
he
had
looked
enigmatically
upon
this
broad
eternally
inaccessible
world
full
of
past
memories
and
past
people
but
his
love
of
elisaveta
meant
his
love
and
acceptance
of
the
world
the
whole
world
this
emotion
aroused
dismay
in
trirodov
to
the
perplexities
of
the
past
not
yet
thrown
off
his
shoulders
and
to
those
of
the
present
begun
with
a
strange
as
yet
unmeasured
influence
were
to
be
added
the
perplexities
of
the
future
of
a
new
and
unexpected
bond
and
was
not
love
in
itself
a
means
for
realizing
one
s
dreams
trirodov
made
effort
to
crush
this
new
love
in
himself
and
to
forget
elisaveta
he
tried
to
keep
away
from
the
rameyevs
not
to
come
to
their
house
but
with
each
day
his
love
only
increased
his
thoughts
and
musings
of
elisaveta
grew
more
and
more
persistent
they
became
interwoven
with
one
another
and
grafted
themselves
on
to
his
soul
more
and
more
a
pencil
in
his
hand
guided
itself
to
outline
on
paper
now
her
austere
profile
softened
by
the
youthful
joy
of
liberation
now
her
simple
costume
now
a
rapid
sketch
of
her
shoulders
and
neck
or
the
knot
of
her
broad
belt
again
and
again
a
strong
hope
awakened
in
him
that
he
might
strangle
and
crush
the
gentle
blossom
of
his
delicious
love
several
days
had
already
passed
without
his
visiting
the
rameyevs
he
did
not
even
come
on
those
days
on
which
they
grew
accustomed
to
expect
him
elisaveta
thought
this
a
deliberate
incivility
and
it
hurt
her
feelings
but
whenever
piotr
abused
him
she
defended
him
her
imagination
began
to
evoke
more
and
more
frequently
the
features
of
his
face
his
deep
observing
glance
his
proud
ironic
smile
his
pale
face
like
an
actor
s
and
cold
like
a
mask
how
sweetly
and
how
bitterly
she
was
in
love
with
him
her
sweet
vision
betrayed
itself
in
the
gleam
in
her
eyes
rameyev
had
grown
fond
of
trirodov
and
he
missed
his
presence
he
found
it
a
pleasant
diversion
to
chat
with
trirodov
and
even
to
wrangle
with
him
sometimes
he
made
two
calls
at
trirodov
s
house
and
did
not
find
him
in
rameyev
wrote
several
invitations
he
received
courteous
but
evasive
replies
expressing
regret
at
not
being
able
to
come
one
evening
rameyev
growled
at
piotr
he
stopped
coming
because
of
your
piotr
replied
sharply
let
him
stay
away
i
m
very
rameyev
looked
at
him
sternly
and
said
but
i
m
not
glad
there
s
one
interesting
man
in
this
wilderness
and
we
frighten
him
piotr
excused
himself
he
felt
uneasy
he
walked
out
of
the
house
alone
aimlessly
wishing
only
to
escape
his
own
relatives
the
sunset
blazed
for
a
long
time
tormented
itself
with
its
unwillingness
to
die
it
lingered
on
as
if
it
were
its
last
day
and
at
last
expired
the
whole
sky
became
blue
exquisitely
blue
but
to
the
an
edge
of
it
was
translucently
green
the
quiet
stars
trembled
in
the
blue
heights
the
moon
which
had
looked
for
some
time
a
pale
white
in
the
luminous
clearness
now
rose
yellow
and
distinct
almost
total
darkness
covered
the
earth
there
was
a
coolness
along
the
bank
of
the
river
after
the
hot
day
there
was
an
odour
of
a
forest
fire
and
it
too
softened
its
unpleasant
malignant
bitterness
in
the
dark
evening
coolness
a
bathed
near
the
low
dark
dam
she
splashed
about
in
the
water
which
struck
the
obstruction
with
a
brittle
sound
and
in
rhythmic
response
to
it
the
stream
laughed
most
sonorously
piotr
walked
quietly
upon
the
path
along
the
and
thought
of
elisaveta
sadly
and
languorously
or
rather
he
recalled
her
evoked
her
in
vision
involuntarily
yielded
himself
to
the
melancholy
play
of
the
nervous
fantasies
of
his
brain
the
peaceful
silence
of
the
evening
so
much
at
one
with
him
said
to
him
without
words
yet
comprehensibly
that
the
pitch
of
his
soul
was
too
quiet
too
feeble
for
elisaveta
who
was
so
strong
so
erect
and
so
simple
he
had
so
little
audacity
so
little
daring
he
only
believed
in
christ
in
antichrist
in
his
love
in
her
indifference
he
only
believed
he
only
sought
for
the
truth
and
could
not
create
it
he
could
evoke
neither
a
god
from
nonentity
nor
a
devil
from
dialectical
argument
neither
a
conquering
love
from
carnal
emotions
nor
a
conquering
hate
from
stubborn
and
he
loved
elisaveta
he
had
loved
her
a
long
time
with
a
jealous
and
helpless
love
he
loved
what
sadness
the
languor
of
the
springtide
and
the
joyousness
of
the
morning
breeze
the
distant
ringing
of
bells
tears
in
one
s
eyes
and
she
will
smile
pass
by
the
dear
one
what
sadness
how
dark
everything
is
upon
this
earth
love
as
well
as
indifference
suddenly
piotr
saw
trirodov
quite
near
him
trirodov
was
walking
straight
upon
piotr
as
if
he
did
not
see
him
he
moved
quickly
almost
automatically
like
a
mechanical
doll
he
held
a
hat
in
the
hand
that
hung
loose
at
his
side
his
face
was
pale
he
had
a
wild
look
his
eyes
were
aflame
he
uttered
disconnected
words
he
walked
so
impetuously
that
piotr
had
no
time
to
turn
aside
they
came
face
to
face
almost
colliding
with
one
another
trirodov
gave
a
start
when
he
saw
that
he
was
not
alone
his
face
had
an
expression
of
fright
piotr
got
out
of
his
way
awkwardly
but
trirodov
walked
rapidly
up
to
him
and
looked
intently
as
he
turned
his
own
back
to
the
moonlight
piotr
involuntarily
yielding
to
this
movement
also
turned
round
the
moon
now
looked
straight
into
piotr
s
handsome
face
which
seemed
pale
and
strange
in
the
cold
lifeless
light
trirodov
began
in
a
trembling
agitated
voice
ah
that
is
you
as
you
see
said
piotr
in
a
tone
of
derision
i
didn
t
expect
to
meet
you
here
said
trirodov
i
took
you
for
but
he
did
not
finish
piotr
somewhat
vexed
asked
him
for
whom
without
replying
to
the
question
trirodov
inquired
but
where
there
s
no
one
here
you
didn
t
hear
i
wasn
t
trained
to
eavesdropping
replied
piotr
all
the
more
since
these
fragments
of
poetry
are
inaccessible
to
who
talks
of
eavesdropping
exclaimed
trirodov
no
i
thought
that
you
had
unwillingly
heard
some
words
which
might
have
sounded
strange
enigmatic
or
terrible
in
your
i
came
here
by
chance
said
piotr
i
was
taking
a
mere
stroll
and
was
not
here
to
listen
to
any
trirodov
looked
attentively
at
piotr
then
lowered
his
head
with
a
sigh
and
said
quietly
forgive
me
my
nerves
are
in
a
bad
state
i
have
grown
accustomed
to
living
with
my
fantasies
and
in
the
peaceful
society
of
my
quiet
children
i
love
where
did
your
quiet
children
come
from
asked
piotr
somewhat
contemptuously
but
trirodov
continued
as
though
he
had
not
heard
please
forgive
me
i
too
often
accept
for
reality
that
which
exists
only
in
my
imagination
perhaps
always
i
live
devoted
to
my
there
was
so
poignant
a
sadness
in
these
words
and
in
the
way
they
were
uttered
that
piotr
felt
an
involuntary
pity
for
trirodov
his
hate
strangely
vanished
as
the
moon
vanishes
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
trirodov
said
with
quiet
sadness
i
have
so
many
strange
whims
and
ways
it
is
in
vain
that
i
go
to
see
people
it
is
far
better
for
me
to
be
alone
with
my
innocent
quiet
children
with
my
secrets
and
why
better
asked
piotr
i
sometimes
feel
that
people
interfere
with
me
said
trirodov
they
weary
me
in
themselves
and
no
less
with
their
petty
commonplace
affairs
and
what
are
they
to
me
there
is
only
one
thing
of
which
i
can
be
sure
that
is
myself
it
is
a
great
task
to
be
with
people
they
give
me
so
little
and
for
that
they
thirstily
and
malignantly
drink
my
whole
soul
how
often
have
i
left
their
company
exhausted
humiliated
crushed
what
a
holiday
for
me
my
solitude
is
my
sweet
solitude
if
it
were
only
with
some
one
else
still
you
would
rather
it
were
with
some
one
else
replied
piotr
with
sudden
malice
trirodov
looked
at
him
steadily
and
said
life
is
tragic
she
destroys
all
illusions
with
the
power
of
her
pitiless
irony
you
know
of
course
that
elisaveta
s
soul
is
a
tragic
soul
and
that
a
great
boldness
is
necessary
in
order
to
approach
her
and
to
say
to
her
the
great
yes
of
life
yes
elisaveta
piotr
s
voice
trembled
as
he
shouted
in
jealous
rage
elisaveta
why
do
you
mention
elisaveta
trirodov
looked
steadily
at
piotr
he
asked
rather
slowly
in
a
strangely
sounding
voice
you
are
not
afraid
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
replied
piotr
morosely
i
am
not
at
all
a
tragic
person
my
path
is
clear
to
me
and
i
know
who
guides
you
don
t
know
that
said
trirodov
besides
elena
is
lovely
he
who
fears
to
take
the
grand
and
the
terrible
he
who
loves
tender
melodies
for
him
there
is
piotr
was
silent
some
sort
of
new
perhaps
alien
thoughts
swarmed
in
his
head
he
listened
to
them
and
suddenly
said
you
haven
t
visited
us
for
a
long
time
and
you
are
very
much
liked
in
our
house
you
would
be
welcome
you
may
come
when
you
like
and
you
may
talk
or
be
silent
as
suits
your
trirodov
smiled
in
response
piotr
matov
returned
home
quite
late
in
a
dazed
state
of
mind
every
one
had
already
sat
down
to
supper
elisaveta
glanced
at
him
curiously
as
if
she
expected
another
person
there
instead
of
him
i
ve
come
late
said
piotr
confusedly
i
don
t
know
how
i
managed
to
wander
off
so
he
could
not
understand
why
he
was
so
flustered
he
barely
recognized
elisaveta
dressed
up
as
a
boy
in
her
sailor
jacket
and
short
breeches
she
sat
so
erect
there
and
smiled
her
abstract
indifferent
smile
elena
blushing
for
some
unknown
reason
moved
silently
closer
and
there
was
a
strange
timorousness
in
her
movement
a
timorous
desire
piotr
complied
with
her
wish
and
sat
down
at
her
side
she
looked
at
him
tenderly
lovingly
her
glances
touched
him
he
thought
why
do
i
not
love
elena
or
is
it
she
alone
that
i
really
love
perhaps
some
mistake
of
the
will
had
dimmed
my
eyes
he
conversed
with
her
gently
and
tenderly
and
as
he
looked
at
her
again
and
again
a
new
love
took
spark
in
him
it
was
as
if
by
some
prodigious
power
the
strange
being
at
the
had
instilled
this
new
love
into
him
elena
s
heart
beat
joyfully
chapter
xix
after
that
evening
trirodov
suppressing
his
devotion
to
quiet
loneliness
once
more
began
to
visit
the
rameyevs
he
resisted
no
longer
the
desire
to
see
elisaveta
to
look
into
the
depth
of
her
blue
eyes
to
listen
to
the
golden
sonorousness
of
her
words
and
to
feel
the
breathing
and
the
witchery
of
her
fresh
primitive
strength
it
was
so
pleasant
to
look
upon
her
simple
attire
upon
the
trusting
openness
of
her
shoulders
upon
the
light
tan
of
her
feet
and
upon
the
austere
outlines
of
her
face
elisaveta
s
sunlit
depth
became
transformed
for
trirodov
into
a
blue
fathomless
height
elisaveta
s
love
grew
stronger
to
grow
stronger
was
its
desire
and
it
wished
to
surmount
all
intolerable
obstacles
rameyev
looked
at
elisaveta
and
trirodov
and
he
was
consumed
by
a
strange
mature
joy
he
seemed
to
think
they
will
marry
and
bring
me
there
were
already
certain
hours
in
which
they
expected
him
he
and
elisaveta
often
remained
alone
something
in
their
natures
drew
them
apart
from
other
people
whether
strangers
or
kin
they
would
go
off
somewhere
into
a
neglected
part
of
the
garden
where
under
the
spread
net
of
superb
black
poplars
the
agreeable
aroma
of
thyme
reached
them
with
a
gentle
poignancy
and
here
they
loved
to
chat
with
one
another
had
he
been
alone
instead
of
with
elisaveta
he
could
not
have
expressed
his
thoughts
more
simply
or
more
candidly
they
spoke
of
so
many
things
they
tried
as
it
were
to
contain
the
whole
world
within
the
rigid
bounds
of
rapid
words
as
they
strolled
along
the
high
bank
of
the
river
under
the
broad
shadows
of
the
mighty
black
poplars
and
strange
black
maples
and
listened
to
the
loud
cheerful
twitter
of
the
birds
that
came
to
the
bushes
elisaveta
said
the
sensation
of
existence
and
of
the
fullness
and
joy
of
life
is
delicious
a
new
sky
seems
to
have
opened
above
my
head
and
for
the
first
time
the
violets
and
the
lilies
of
the
valley
besprinkled
with
their
first
dew
have
begun
to
bloom
for
me
and
for
the
first
time
made
from
herbs
by
young
housewives
taste
trirodov
smiled
sadly
and
said
i
feel
the
heavy
burden
of
life
but
what
s
to
be
done
i
don
t
know
whether
life
can
be
made
more
easy
and
why
desire
ease
and
tranquillity
in
life
asked
elisaveta
i
want
fire
and
passion
even
if
i
perish
let
me
become
consumed
in
the
fire
of
rapture
and
yes
said
trirodov
it
is
necessary
to
discover
all
the
possibilities
and
forces
within
oneself
and
then
a
new
life
may
be
created
i
wonder
if
life
is
necessary
and
what
is
necessary
asked
elisaveta
i
don
t
know
answered
trirodov
sadly
what
do
you
desire
she
asked
again
perhaps
i
desire
nothing
said
trirodov
there
are
moments
when
i
seem
to
expect
nothing
from
life
i
do
what
i
do
unwillingly
as
if
it
were
a
disagreeable
how
do
you
live
then
asked
elisaveta
in
astonishment
he
replied
i
live
in
a
strange
and
unreal
world
i
live
but
life
goes
past
me
always
past
me
woman
s
love
the
fire
of
youth
the
stirring
of
young
hopes
remain
for
ever
within
the
forbidden
boundaries
of
unrealized
possibilities
who
knows
perhaps
the
sad
flaming
moments
of
silence
were
marked
by
the
heavy
beats
of
elisaveta
s
heart
she
felt
intensely
vexed
by
these
sad
words
of
weakness
and
of
dejection
and
she
did
not
believe
them
but
trirodov
went
on
speaking
and
his
beautiful
but
hopelessly
sad
words
sounded
like
a
taunt
to
her
there
is
so
much
labour
and
so
little
consolation
life
passes
by
like
a
dream
a
senseless
tormenting
if
only
a
radiant
dream
if
only
a
tempestuous
dream
exclaimed
elisaveta
trirodov
smiled
and
said
the
time
of
awakening
is
drawing
nearer
old
age
comes
with
its
depression
and
the
empty
meaningless
life
wanders
on
towards
unknown
borders
you
ask
yourself
and
it
seems
hopeless
to
find
a
worthy
answer
why
do
i
live
in
this
strange
and
chance
form
why
have
i
chosen
my
present
lot
why
have
i
done
this
well
who
is
at
fault
here
asked
elisaveta
trirodov
replied
the
conscience
ripened
to
universal
fullness
says
that
every
fault
is
my
and
that
every
action
is
my
action
added
elisaveta
an
action
is
so
impossible
said
trirodov
a
miracle
is
impossible
i
wish
to
break
loose
from
the
claims
of
this
dull
you
speak
of
love
said
elisaveta
as
of
a
thing
unrealized
but
you
had
a
yes
said
trirodov
sadly
the
short
moments
passed
by
rapidly
was
there
love
i
can
not
say
there
was
passion
a
smouldering
and
life
will
again
bring
its
delights
to
you
said
elisaveta
confidently
and
trirodov
answered
yes
it
will
be
a
different
life
but
what
s
that
to
me
if
one
could
only
be
quite
different
and
simple
say
a
small
child
a
boy
with
bare
feet
with
a
in
his
hands
his
mouth
yawning
only
children
really
live
i
envy
them
frightfully
i
envy
frightfully
the
simple
folk
the
altogether
simple
folk
remote
from
these
cheerless
comprehensions
of
the
intellect
children
live
only
children
ripeness
already
marks
the
beginning
of
to
love
and
to
die
asked
elisaveta
with
a
smile
she
listened
to
the
sound
of
these
beautiful
sad
words
and
repeated
them
quietly
to
love
and
to
die
and
as
she
listened
again
she
heard
him
say
she
loved
and
she
what
was
the
name
of
your
first
wife
asked
elisaveta
she
was
amazed
at
herself
for
uttering
the
word
first
as
there
had
been
only
one
and
her
face
became
suffused
slowly
with
pink
trirodov
fell
into
thought
he
appeared
not
to
have
heard
her
question
and
was
silent
elisaveta
did
not
repeat
it
he
suddenly
smiled
and
said
you
and
i
feel
ourselves
to
be
living
people
here
and
what
can
there
be
for
us
more
certain
than
our
life
our
sensation
of
life
and
yet
it
is
possible
that
you
and
i
are
not
living
people
at
all
but
only
characters
in
a
novel
and
that
the
author
of
this
novel
is
not
at
all
concerned
with
its
external
verisimilitude
his
capricious
imagination
had
taken
this
dark
earth
for
its
material
and
out
of
this
dark
sinful
earth
he
grew
these
strange
black
maples
and
these
mighty
black
poplars
and
these
twittering
birds
in
the
bushes
and
elisaveta
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
and
said
with
a
smile
i
hope
that
the
novel
will
be
interesting
and
beautiful
let
it
even
end
in
death
but
tell
me
why
do
you
write
so
little
with
unexpected
passion
almost
with
exasperation
trirodov
replied
why
should
i
write
volumes
of
tales
on
how
they
fell
in
love
and
why
they
fell
out
of
love
and
all
that
i
write
only
that
which
comes
from
myself
that
which
has
not
yet
been
said
so
much
has
already
been
said
it
is
far
better
to
add
a
simple
word
of
one
s
own
than
write
volumes
of
eternal
themes
are
always
one
and
the
same
said
elisaveta
do
they
not
constitute
the
content
of
great
art
we
never
originate
said
trirodov
we
always
appear
in
the
world
with
a
ready
inheritance
we
are
the
eternal
successors
that
is
why
we
are
not
free
we
see
the
world
with
others
eyes
the
eyes
of
the
dead
but
i
live
only
when
i
make
everything
my
and
while
these
two
spent
their
hours
in
conversing
piotr
usually
made
his
way
somewhere
to
the
top
of
the
house
he
sometimes
descended
with
his
eyes
red
red
from
tears
or
from
the
vigorous
high
wind
his
days
dragged
on
miserably
his
hate
and
jealousy
of
trirodov
now
and
again
tormented
him
piotr
sometimes
made
unpleasant
pitiful
scenes
before
elisaveta
he
loved
her
and
he
hated
her
he
would
have
killed
her
had
he
dared
and
he
had
not
the
force
to
hate
either
elisaveta
or
trirodov
to
the
bitter
end
when
he
learned
to
know
trirodov
better
his
hate
lost
something
of
its
venom
his
malice
no
longer
irritated
him
like
nettles
he
looked
with
curiosity
upon
them
and
began
to
understand
the
agony
of
his
unconscious
fury
was
replaced
by
a
clear
contemplation
of
the
separating
abyss
and
this
made
him
even
more
miserable
he
decided
to
go
away
he
made
the
decision
again
and
again
but
always
remained
there
restless
and
yearning
as
for
misha
he
fell
quite
in
love
with
trirodov
he
liked
to
remain
with
elisaveta
in
order
to
talk
about
him
one
evening
piotr
came
to
trirodov
s
house
he
did
not
like
to
go
there
for
such
antagonistic
feelings
wrestled
in
his
soul
but
common
courtesy
made
the
visit
necessary
again
a
discussion
was
started
in
piotr
s
opinion
revolution
was
to
the
detriment
of
religion
and
culture
it
was
a
tedious
unnecessary
discussion
but
piotr
could
never
resist
uttering
malicious
words
against
the
extremes
of
the
liberating
he
felt
awkward
during
the
whole
visit
he
wished
to
handle
something
all
the
time
and
to
be
doing
something
his
restlessness
tormented
him
in
a
strange
way
now
he
picked
up
one
trifle
from
the
table
now
another
and
put
it
down
again
he
took
a
prism
in
his
hand
trirodov
trembled
he
said
something
quietly
and
inaudibly
piotr
did
not
hear
but
kept
on
looking
in
astonishment
at
the
heavy
prism
in
his
hand
and
as
he
turned
it
over
and
over
he
wondered
at
the
reason
of
its
weight
trirodov
trembled
nervously
piotr
in
turning
the
prism
rather
awkwardly
struck
it
against
the
edge
of
the
table
trirodov
shivered
shouted
something
incoherently
and
snatching
the
prism
from
piotr
s
hands
said
in
an
agitated
voice
please
put
it
down
piotr
looked
in
astonishment
at
trirodov
who
was
visibly
confused
piotr
smiled
unwillingly
and
asked
why
what
is
it
how
should
i
tell
you
said
trirodov
it
is
connected
with
please
forgive
my
sharpness
i
thought
you
were
going
to
drop
it
and
i
wanted
to
it
seems
like
a
whim
of
course
it
is
really
nothing
but
it
is
connected
with
an
old
episode
in
my
life
really
i
don
t
know
why
i
keep
these
ugly
things
on
my
table
but
there
are
such
intimate
memories
you
understand
still
i
m
so
very
sorry
piotr
listened
in
perplexity
suddenly
he
realized
that
it
was
rude
to
be
silent
for
so
long
and
he
made
haste
to
say
not
without
embarrassment
please
don
t
think
about
it
i
quite
well
understand
that
there
are
things
which
but
if
you
find
it
difficult
or
unpleasant
to
speak
about
it
then
please
trirodov
said
a
few
more
incoherent
confused
words
of
apology
to
piotr
and
thanked
him
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
when
stchemilov
was
announced
piotr
let
loose
his
irritation
at
the
with
the
ironic
question
again
free
for
how
long
i
ve
skipped
answered
stchemilov
calmly
i
m
leading
an
illegal
life
piotr
soon
left
asked
stchemilov
here
yes
we
ll
meet
here
replied
trirodov
he
hasn
t
left
yet
and
there
are
several
matters
and
reports
to
attend
to
it
is
necessary
to
arrange
a
meeting
and
to
let
various
people
know
about
you
have
a
convenient
house
here
said
stchemilov
may
i
help
myself
he
added
pointing
at
the
box
of
cigars
as
he
lounged
back
comfortably
on
the
large
sofa
most
convenient
he
repeated
as
he
lit
his
cigar
they
don
t
suspect
us
as
yet
but
if
they
should
pay
you
a
visit
there
are
so
many
exits
and
entrances
here
and
nooks
very
convenient
indeed
it
is
easy
to
hide
things
here
no
comparison
at
all
with
my
little
chapter
xx
the
town
was
in
a
state
of
unrest
strikes
were
in
the
air
patriotic
demonstrations
were
held
its
outer
environs
were
visited
by
characters
these
distributed
proclamations
mostly
of
an
illiterate
nature
in
the
villages
the
proclamations
threatened
incendiarism
if
the
peasants
did
not
revolt
the
incendiaries
were
to
be
students
discharged
from
the
factories
on
account
of
the
strikes
the
peasants
believed
the
announcement
in
some
of
the
villages
watchmen
were
engaged
to
catch
the
incendiaries
at
night
ostrov
began
to
play
a
noticeable
r√¥le
in
town
he
quickly
squandered
the
money
he
received
from
trirodov
in
drink
and
in
other
ways
he
did
not
dare
as
yet
to
visit
trirodov
again
but
appeared
to
be
in
an
expectant
mood
and
remained
in
town
it
was
here
that
ostrov
met
his
old
friend
yakov
poltinin
yakov
poltinin
and
two
other
members
of
the
black
hundred
were
sent
from
the
capital
at
the
request
of
kerbakh
and
zherbenev
the
apparent
purpose
of
this
request
was
to
establish
a
connexion
between
the
local
section
of
the
black
hundred
union
organized
by
kerbakh
zherbenev
and
konopatskaya
the
wife
of
a
general
with
the
central
office
of
the
organization
the
actual
purpose
however
as
understood
by
all
these
respected
folk
though
they
ventured
to
do
little
more
than
hint
of
it
to
one
another
was
to
establish
with
the
help
of
the
trio
a
patriotic
movement
in
short
to
strike
a
blow
at
the
yakov
poltinin
took
ostrov
with
him
to
visit
the
families
of
the
patriots
a
company
of
suspicious
characters
was
in
town
ready
to
do
anything
they
were
bidden
yakov
poltinin
led
ostrov
also
among
this
company
in
the
course
of
the
company
s
friendly
carouse
at
poltinin
s
apartments
in
a
dirty
little
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
the
idea
of
stealing
the
sacred
ikon
came
into
some
one
s
mind
poltinin
said
there
s
no
end
of
precious
stones
on
it
of
all
sorts
diamonds
sapphires
and
rubies
it
took
hundred
of
years
to
collect
them
little
mother
russia
orthodox
russia
has
done
her
the
thief
potseluytchikov
affirmed
it
s
certainly
worth
not
less
than
two
you
re
putting
it
on
rather
thick
declared
ostrov
incredulously
not
at
all
said
poltinin
with
a
knowing
look
two
million
is
putting
it
mildly
it
s
more
likely
worth
and
how
are
you
going
to
dispose
of
it
asked
ostrov
i
know
how
said
poltinin
confidently
of
course
you
d
get
a
trifle
compared
with
its
real
value
still
we
ought
to
get
a
out
of
this
was
followed
by
blasphemous
jests
yakov
poltinin
had
for
some
time
entertained
the
secret
ambition
of
accomplishing
something
on
a
grand
scale
something
that
would
cause
a
lot
of
talk
it
is
true
the
murder
of
the
chief
of
police
created
a
deep
impression
still
it
was
hardly
as
important
as
the
affair
he
had
in
mind
to
steal
and
destroy
the
ikon
that
would
be
something
to
crow
about
poltinin
said
the
socialist
revolutionaries
are
certain
to
be
blamed
for
it
expropriation
for
party
purposes
why
not
as
for
us
no
one
will
even
suspect
the
priests
will
never
get
over
it
declared
molin
a
former
instructor
who
was
a
drunkard
and
a
thief
a
deprived
of
his
legal
rights
the
friends
began
preparations
for
the
projected
theft
now
one
of
them
now
another
developed
the
habit
of
frequenting
the
monastery
ostrov
especially
received
an
eager
welcome
there
he
pleased
by
his
external
piety
the
older
monks
who
were
in
authority
there
were
a
number
of
convivial
monks
who
were
especially
fond
of
ostrov
the
monks
advised
him
to
join
the
local
union
of
the
black
hundred
they
said
that
it
would
be
pleasing
to
god
they
engaged
him
in
religious
and
patriotic
conversations
and
invited
him
to
drink
with
them
poltinin
and
potseluychikov
were
also
well
received
in
the
monastery
strange
threads
are
woven
into
the
relations
of
people
at
times
although
piotr
matov
met
ostrov
under
unfriendly
circumstances
ostrov
managed
to
scrape
up
an
acquaintance
even
with
him
it
reached
a
point
when
piotr
even
agreed
to
make
a
journey
with
ostrov
to
the
monastery
glafira
pavlovna
konopatskaya
the
rich
widow
of
a
general
was
an
energetic
woman
and
enjoyed
considerable
influence
in
town
she
was
a
most
generous
contributor
to
the
various
enterprises
of
the
black
hundred
her
house
served
as
the
of
the
local
branch
of
this
organization
as
well
as
of
another
secret
society
which
bore
the
elaborate
name
of
the
union
of
active
combat
with
revolution
and
the
initiation
ceremony
of
the
union
was
very
elaborately
exulting
especial
efforts
were
made
to
attract
working
men
each
new
member
was
presented
with
a
badge
a
browning
revolver
and
a
little
money
the
local
patriots
used
to
say
about
glafira
pavlovna
s
house
here
dwells
the
russian
spirit
here
it
smells
of
russia
after
the
meeting
it
usually
smelt
of
vodka
and
shag
some
of
the
working
men
joined
these
unions
for
material
reasons
others
from
ignorance
the
black
hundred
had
but
a
few
members
from
among
the
working
class
by
conviction
the
union
of
active
combat
attracted
people
who
served
now
one
side
now
the
other
people
like
yakov
poltinin
and
even
two
or
three
confirmed
revolutionaries
they
accepted
the
brownings
and
handed
them
over
to
members
of
revolutionary
organizations
members
of
the
union
did
not
find
this
out
until
quite
late
kerbakh
and
zherbenev
were
the
most
frequent
guests
at
glafira
pavlovna
s
cosy
hospitable
house
evil
tongues
made
slander
of
this
and
associated
her
name
now
with
kerbakh
now
with
zherbenev
but
this
was
a
calumny
her
heart
had
only
a
place
for
a
young
official
who
served
as
a
private
secretary
to
the
governor
once
after
dinner
at
konopatskaya
s
kerbakh
and
zherbenev
were
telling
glafira
pavlovna
about
ostrov
kerbakh
was
the
first
to
broach
the
subject
i
have
in
view
a
man
whom
i
should
like
to
call
to
your
i
too
know
a
lively
chap
said
zherbenev
kerbakh
annoyed
at
the
interruption
looked
none
too
amiably
at
zherbenev
and
went
on
he
didn
t
at
all
please
me
at
my
friend
also
did
not
appeal
to
me
at
the
beginning
said
zherbenev
who
would
not
stay
repressed
to
look
at
him
you
might
think
that
he
s
a
said
kerbakh
that
describes
my
man
too
announced
zherbenev
as
if
he
were
announcing
something
gay
and
pleasant
but
at
heart
went
on
kerbakh
he
is
an
ingenuous
infant
and
an
enthusiastic
well
well
and
mine
s
like
that
too
chimed
in
zherbenev
glafira
pavlovna
smiled
graciously
at
both
of
them
whom
are
you
talking
about
asked
kerbakh
at
last
rather
annoyed
at
his
companion
zherbenev
replied
there
is
a
chap
here
what
s
his
name
you
remember
we
met
him
at
the
pier
some
time
ago
he
was
rather
interested
in
you
mean
ostrov
ventured
kerbakh
that
s
the
fellow
said
zherbenev
i
also
meant
him
said
kerbakh
excellent
exclaimed
zherbenev
we
seem
to
agree
about
him
so
you
see
glafira
pavlovna
we
ought
to
invite
him
into
our
union
he
would
be
a
most
useful
man
once
mention
jews
to
him
and
he
begins
to
howl
like
a
dog
on
a
of
course
we
ought
to
have
him
decided
glafira
pavlovna
it
is
just
such
people
that
we
that
was
how
ostrov
came
to
be
admitted
into
the
union
he
worked
very
zealously
on
its
behalf
one
of
the
chief
functions
of
the
black
hundred
was
to
lodge
information
against
certain
people
they
informed
the
governor
and
the
head
of
the
district
schools
that
trirodov
s
wards
had
been
at
the
funeral
of
the
working
men
killed
in
the
woods
the
colony
established
by
trirodov
had
for
some
time
been
a
source
of
great
annoyance
and
scandal
to
the
townsfolk
complaints
had
been
lodged
with
the
authorities
even
earlier
ostrov
communicated
considerable
information
mostly
invented
by
himself
or
by
the
alert
townsmen
the
head
of
the
schools
sent
an
order
to
the
headmaster
of
the
national
schools
to
make
an
investigation
the
governor
took
other
measures
clouds
were
beginning
to
gather
over
trirodov
s
colony
the
union
also
made
no
little
effort
to
arouse
the
hooligan
part
of
the
population
against
the
jews
and
against
the
the
town
was
in
a
state
of
ferment
the
cossacks
often
paraded
the
streets
the
working
men
eyed
them
with
hostility
some
one
spread
rumours
about
town
that
preparations
were
being
made
for
an
armed
revolt
trifling
causes
led
to
tragic
collisions
one
evening
the
summer
garden
was
full
of
people
they
were
strolling
or
else
listening
to
the
music
and
to
the
songs
in
the
theatre
the
evening
was
quiet
and
the
sky
still
red
just
outside
the
the
dust
was
flying
before
the
wind
and
settled
now
on
the
pointed
leaves
of
the
now
on
the
small
light
purple
flowers
near
the
road
there
was
a
glow
in
the
sky
the
road
stretched
towards
it
and
the
grey
of
the
dust
mingling
with
the
red
glow
produced
a
play
of
colour
very
agreeable
to
the
eye
a
red
giant
genie
broke
his
vessel
with
its
solomon
s
seal
freed
himself
and
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
town
he
laughed
soundlessly
yet
repugnantly
his
breath
was
like
the
smoky
breath
of
a
forest
fire
but
he
made
sentimental
grimaces
tore
white
petals
from
gigantic
marguerites
and
whispered
in
a
hoarse
voice
which
stirred
the
blood
of
the
young
he
loves
me
he
loves
me
not
he
will
cut
me
up
he
will
hang
but
the
people
did
not
see
him
they
were
looking
at
the
sky
and
saying
how
superb
i
love
nature
and
do
you
love
nature
others
looked
on
indifferently
and
thought
that
it
did
not
matter
the
lovers
of
nature
bragged
before
these
because
they
admired
the
splendid
sunset
and
were
able
to
enjoy
nature
they
said
to
the
others
you
old
chap
are
a
dry
stick
i
suppose
you
d
rather
go
to
a
stuffy
room
and
play
the
promenaders
strolled
on
crowding
and
jostling
each
other
they
were
flaunting
their
gaiety
there
was
a
cheerful
hum
and
young
girls
amused
by
schoolboys
and
officials
giggled
grey
devilkins
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
when
the
little
hopped
on
the
girls
shoulders
and
poked
their
shaggy
and
ticklish
little
paws
into
the
corsage
under
the
chemise
the
girls
raised
piercing
screams
they
were
dressed
prettily
and
lightly
in
holiday
order
their
high
breasts
outlined
under
their
coloured
textures
taunted
the
youths
an
officer
of
the
cossacks
was
among
those
on
the
promenade
he
had
had
a
drop
too
much
which
made
his
face
red
he
was
in
a
gay
mood
and
he
began
to
boast
we
ll
cut
their
heads
off
yes
of
all
of
them
the
petty
tradesmen
treated
him
to
drinks
embraced
him
and
said
to
him
cut
their
throats
do
us
the
favour
make
a
good
job
of
it
it
will
serve
these
anathemas
right
too
as
for
the
women
and
the
girls
give
them
a
hiding
the
hotter
the
there
was
a
continuous
change
of
amusements
each
noisier
and
duller
than
the
one
before
now
in
the
theatre
now
in
the
open
they
played
a
stupid
but
obscene
vaudeville
piece
and
vicious
topical
songs
were
sung
a
thunder
of
applause
an
animated
screeched
and
pulled
about
with
her
naked
excessively
whitened
shoulders
and
winked
with
her
exaggeratedly
painted
eyes
a
woman
acrobat
raising
her
legs
attired
in
pink
tights
above
her
head
was
dancing
on
her
hands
everything
was
as
if
the
town
were
not
under
guard
and
as
if
the
cossacks
were
not
riding
about
in
the
streets
suddenly
some
one
in
the
depth
of
the
garden
raised
a
cry
a
frightful
confusion
spread
among
the
crowd
many
darted
impetuously
towards
the
exit
others
jumped
over
the
fence
suddenly
the
crowd
with
frenzied
cries
came
sweeping
in
retreat
from
the
exits
back
into
the
depth
of
the
garden
cossacks
darted
in
from
somewhere
and
crying
savagely
made
their
way
along
the
garden
paths
their
sudden
appearance
gave
the
impression
that
they
were
waiting
somewhere
near
by
for
the
command
their
knouts
began
to
work
rapidly
the
thin
textures
upon
the
girls
shoulders
were
rent
apart
and
delicate
bodies
were
unbared
and
beautiful
spots
showed
themselves
on
the
skin
like
quickly
ripened
flowers
drops
of
blood
large
like
bilberries
splattered
into
the
air
which
had
already
quenched
its
thirst
on
the
evening
coolness
on
the
odour
of
the
foliage
and
the
aroma
of
artificial
scents
delicately
shrill
loud
sobs
were
the
accompaniment
to
the
dull
flat
lashings
of
whips
across
the
bodies
they
threw
themselves
this
way
and
that
way
they
ran
where
they
could
several
were
caught
ragged
young
men
and
girls
with
short
hair
two
or
three
of
the
girls
were
caught
and
beaten
in
error
they
were
from
the
most
peaceful
even
respected
families
in
town
these
were
afterwards
permitted
to
go
free
the
hooligans
were
making
merry
in
a
dirty
beerhouse
they
were
celebrating
something
or
another
were
jingling
their
money
discussing
future
earnings
and
laughing
uproariously
one
table
was
especially
absorbed
in
its
noisy
gaiety
there
sat
the
celebrated
nil
krasavtsev
with
three
of
his
friends
they
drank
and
sang
hooligan
songs
then
paid
their
bill
and
went
out
one
could
hear
their
savage
outbursts

are

are

want
to
get

it
wouldn

bad
thing
to
cut
up
a
jewess
the
jews
want
to
take
over
the
whole
it
had
grown
dark
the
hooligans
went
into
the
main
street
the
sretenka
it
was
very
quiet
and
only
a
few
were
to
be
met
with
people
stood
here
and
there
at
their
gates
and
talked
a
jewish
widow
sat
at
the
gate
of
a
house
and
chatted
with
her
neighbour
a
jewish
tailor
her
children
a
whole
throng
of
them
one
smaller
than
the
other
played
about
here
deeply
wrapt
in
their

walked
up
to
the
jewess
and
shouted

dog
of
a

pray
to

for
the
orthodox
tsar
what
do
you
want
of

cried
the
jewess
i

not
touching
you
you
had
better
go
away
what
s
that
you
say
shouted
the
hooligan
a
broad
knife
was
lifted
in
the
darkness
and
gleaming
came
down
in
a
swoop
piercing
the
old
woman
she
gave
a
quick
shrill
cry
and
fell
back
dead
the
jew
terrified
ran
away
filling
the
night
air
with
his
piteous
wails
the
children
began
to
whimper

marched
off

uproariously
chapter
xxi
midday
it
was
quiet
innocent
and
fresh
in
the
depth
of
the
wood
at
the
edge
of
the
hollow
and
the
outer
heat
penetrated
hither
only
by
an
infinite
coiling
as
of
a
scaly
serpent
impotent
at
last
and
deprived
of
its
poison
trirodov
had
found
this
place
for
himself
and
elisaveta
more
than
once
they
came
here
together
to
read
to
talk
and
to
sit
a
while
at
the
stone
out
of
which
like
a
strange
corporeal
ghost
grew
up
all
awry
a
slender
quaking
ash
elisaveta
dressed
in
her
simple
short
skirt
her
long
sunburnt
arms
and
part
of
her
legs
showing
seemed
so
tall
so
erect
and
so
graceful
at
this
stone
elisaveta
was
reading
aloud
poems
how
golden
her
voice
sounded
with
its
seductive
sonorousness
trirodov
listened
with
a
slightly
ironical
smile
to
these
familiar
infinitely
deep
and
lovely
words
so
seemingly
meaningless
in
life
when
she
finished
trirodov
said
a
man
s
whole
life
is
barely
enough
to
think
out
a
single
idea
you
mean
to
say
that
each
should
choose
for
himself
but
a
single
yes
if
people
could
but
grasp
this
fact
human
knowledge
would
take
an
unprecedented
step
forward
but
we
are
afraid
to
and
coarse
life
already
hovered
near
them
behind
their
backs
and
was
about
to
intrude
upon
them
elisaveta
gave
a
sudden
faint
outcry
at
the
unexpectedness
of
an
unseemly
apparition
a
dirty
man
all
in
tatters
was
almost
upon
them
he
had
approached
them
upon
the
mossy
ground
as
softly
as
a
wood
fairy
he
stretched
out
a
dirty
horny
hand
and
asked
not
at
all
in
a
begging
voice
give
a
hungry
man
something
to
buy
bread
trirodov
frowned
in
annoyance
and
without
looking
at
the
beggar
took
a
silver
coin
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
he
always
kept
a
trifle
about
him
to
provide
for
unexpected
meetings
the
ragged
one
smiled
turned
the
coin
threw
it
upward
caught
it
and
hid
it
adroitly
in
his
pocket
i
thank
your
illustrious
honour
most
humbly
he
said
may
god
give
you
good
health
a
rich
wife
and
assured
success
only
i
want
to
say
something
to
he
grew
silent
and
assumed
a
grave
important
air
trirodov
frowned
even
more
intensely
than
before
and
asked
stiffly
what
is
it
you
wish
to
tell
me
the
ragged
one
said
with
frank
derision
in
his
voice
it
s
this
you
were
reading
a
book
my
good
people
but
not
the
right
he
laughed
a
pathetic
insolent
laugh
it
was
as
if
a
timorous
dog
suddenly
began
to
whine
hoarsely
insolently
and
cautiously
trirodov
asked
again
in
astonishment
not
the
right
one
why
not
the
ragged
one
began
to
speak
with
awkward
gestures
and
he
gave
the
impression
that
he
was
able
to
speak
well
and
eloquently
and
that
he
merely
assumed
his
stupid
unpolished
manner
of
speaking
i
had
been
listening
to
you
a
long
time
i
was
behind
the
bush
there
i
was
asleep
i
must
confess
then
you
came
chattered
away
and
waked
me
the
young
lady
read
well
clearly
and
sympathetically
one
could
see
at
once
that
it
was
from
the
heart
only
i
don
t
like
the
contents
and
all
that
s
in
this
why
don
t
you
like
it
asked
elisaveta
quietly
in
my
opinion
said
the
ragged
one
it
isn
t
your
style
it
doesn
t
fit
you
what
sort
of
book
ought
we
to
read
asked
elisaveta
she
gave
a
light
forced
smile
the
ragged
one
sat
down
on
a
stump
and
answered
in
no
undue
haste
i
am
not
thinking
of
you
alone
honourable
folk
but
of
all
those
who
parade
in
fancy
gaiters
and
in
velvet
dresses
and
look
scornfully
at
our
what
book
again
asked
elisaveta
it
s
the
gospels
that
you
ought
to
read
he
replied
as
he
looked
attentively
and
austerely
at
elisaveta
his
glance
taking
in
her
entire
figure
from
her
flushed
face
down
to
her
feet
why
the
gospels
asked
trirodov
who
suddenly
grew
morose
he
appeared
to
be
pondering
over
something
and
unable
to
decide
his
indecision
seemed
to
torment
him
the
ragged
one
replied
slowly
i
will
tell
you
why
you
ll
find
the
true
facts
there
we
will
take
it
easy
in
paradise
while
the
devils
will
be
pulling
the
veins
out
of
you
in
hell
and
we
shall
look
on
coolly
and
applaud
gaily
with
our
hands
it
ought
to
prove
he
burst
out
into
loud
hoarse
laughter
but
it
seemed
more
assumed
than
joyous
and
rather
abject
and
hideous
elisaveta
shivered
what
a
wicked
person
you
are
why
do
you
think
that
said
elisaveta
reproachfully
the
ragged
one
glanced
at
her
crossly
and
looked
fixedly
into
her
deep
blue
eyes
then
he
said
with
a
broad
smile
why
am
i
wicked
and
are
you
two
good
wicked
or
not
the
thing
is
to
be
just
but
i
may
tell
you
sir
that
i
like
you
he
said
as
he
turned
suddenly
to
trirodov
thank
you
for
your
good
opinion
said
trirodov
with
a
slightly
ironical
smile
but
why
should
you
like
me
he
looked
attentively
at
the
ragged
one
then
suddenly
he
felt
depressed
and
apprehensive
and
he
lowered
his
eyes
the
other
slowly
lit
his
pipe
stretched
himself
and
began
after
a
brief
silence
other
gentlemen
s
mugs
are
mostly
gay
as
if
they
had
gorged
themselves
on
a
pancake
with
cream
or
had
successfully
forged
their
uncle
s
will
but
you
sir
seem
to
have
the
same
lean
mug
always
i
have
been
observing
you
some
time
now
it
s
evident
that
you
have
something
on
your
soul
at
least
a
capital
trirodov
was
silent
he
lifted
himself
on
his
elbow
and
looked
straight
into
the
man
s
eyes
with
such
a
fixed
strange
expression
in
his
unblinking
commanding
wilful
eyes
the
ragged
one
grew
silent
as
if
he
had
been
congealed
for
a
moment
then
as
if
frightened
he
suddenly
shook
himself
he
shrank
and
stooped
and
as
he
took
his
cap
off
he
revealed
an
unkempt
tousled
head
of
hair
he
mumbled
something
slipped
away
among
the
bushes
and
disappeared
quietly
like
a
fairy
of
the
wood
trirodov
looked
gloomily
after
him
and
was
silent
elisaveta
thought
that
he
deliberately
avoided
looking
at
her
she
was
intensely
embarrassed
but
made
an
effort
to
control
herself
she
laughed
and
said
with
assumed
gaiety
what
a
strange
creature
trirodov
turned
upon
her
his
melancholy
glances
and
said
quietly
he
talks
like
one
who
knows
he
talks
like
one
who
sees
but
no
one
can
know
what
oh
if
one
could
only
know
if
one
could
only
change
that
which
once
had
happened
trirodov
recalled
again
during
these
days
the
dark
history
of
piotr
matov
s
father
trirodov
had
carelessly
entangled
himself
in
this
affair
and
now
it
compelled
him
to
have
dealings
with
the
blackmailer
ostrov
piotr
s
father
dmitry
matov
had
fallen
into
a
trap
which
he
had
set
for
others
he
had
joined
a
secret
revolutionary
circle
there
they
soon
discovered
his
relations
with
the
police
and
they
decided
to
detect
him
and
kill
him
one
of
the
members
of
the
circle
the
young
physician
lunitsin
took
the
role
of
betrayer
upon
himself
he
promised
to
obtain
for
dmitry
matov
important
documents
involving
many
of
the
members
they
made
a
bargain
at
a
moderate
figure
the
meeting
at
which
the
documents
were
to
be
exchanged
for
the
money
was
designated
to
take
place
in
a
small
borough
close
to
the
town
in
which
trirodov
then
lived
at
the
appointed
hour
dmitry
matov
got
out
of
his
train
at
a
little
station
it
was
late
in
the
evening
matov
wore
blue
spectacles
and
a
false
beard
as
was
agreed
upon
lunitsin
waited
for
him
a
few
yards
from
the
station
and
led
him
to
a
very
solitary
spot
where
was
situated
the
house
hired
for
the
purpose
a
supper
had
been
prepared
there
matov
ate
heartily
and
drank
much
wine
his
companion
began
to
invent
stories
about
certain
suspicious
movements
he
had
heard
of
lately
little
by
little
matov
grew
candid
and
began
to
boast
of
his
connexions
with
the
police
and
of
the
great
number
of
people
he
had
skilfully
betrayed
the
door
leading
to
the
next
room
was
hung
with
draperies
three
people
were
hiding
in
that
room
trirodov
ostrov
and
the
young
working
man
krovlin
they
were
listening
krovlin
was
intensely
excited
he
kept
on
repeating
in
indignant
whispers
oh
the
scoundrel
the
wretch
ostrov
and
trirodov
managed
to
restrain
him
with
great
difficulty
be
silent
let
him
babble
out
everything
they
said
to
him
at
last
matov
s
impudent
boastfulness
was
too
much
for
krovlin
who
jumped
out
from
his
and
shouted
so
that
s
how
it
is
you
ve
betrayed
our
men
to
the
police
and
you
have
the
face
to
confess
it
dmitry
matov
grew
green
with
fear
he
shouted
to
his
companion
kill
him
he
has
been
listening
to
us
shoot
quick
he
mustn
t
live
he
will
give
us
both
up
at
this
moment
two
other
men
appeared
from
the
same
place
lunitsin
aimed
his
revolver
straight
at
matov
s
forehead
and
asked
who
ought
to
be
killed
traitor
matov
then
understood
that
he
had
been
caught
in
a
trap
but
he
still
made
efforts
to
wriggle
out
of
it
and
called
all
his
skill
and
his
insolence
to
his
assistance
they
tried
him
for
treachery
at
first
he
defended
himself
he
said
that
he
had
deceived
the
police
and
that
he
had
entered
into
relations
with
them
merely
to
get
important
information
for
his
comrades
but
his
protestations
soon
grew
weaker
then
he
began
to
beg
for
mercy
he
spoke
of
his
wife
and
of
his
children
matov
s
entreaties
failed
to
impress
any
one
his
judges
were
adamant
his
fate
was
decided
the
sentence
of
hanging
was
passed
unanimously
matov
was
bound
the
noose
was
already
thrown
about
his
neck
then
trirodov
intervened
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
it
will
be
difficult
to
take
him
away
and
it
is
dangerous
to
leave
him
who
will
come
here
said
lunitsin
at
best
only
by
chance
let
him
hang
here
until
he
s
let
us
bury
him
here
in
the
garden
like
a
dog
suggested
krovlin
give
him
to
me
said
trirodov
i
will
dispose
his
body
in
such
a
way
that
no
one
will
find
the
others
assented
eagerly
ostrov
said
with
a
scornful
smile
will
you
try
your
chemistry
on
him
giorgiy
sergeyevitch
well
it
s
all
the
same
to
us
a
bad
man
ought
to
be
punished
make
even
a
skeleton
of
him
for
your
use
if
you
trirodov
drew
a
flagon
containing
a
colourless
liquid
from
his
pocket
now
this
will
put
him
to
sleep
he
said
he
injected
with
a
small
syringe
several
drops
of
the
liquid
under
dmitry
matov
s
skin
matov
gave
a
feeble
cry
and
fell
heavily
to
the
floor
in
a
few
moments
the
body
lay
before
them
blue
and
apparently
lifeless
lunitsin
examined
matov
and
said
he
s
done
the
men
left
one
by
one
trirodov
alone
remained
with
matov
s
body
trirodov
took
off
matov
s
clothes
and
burned
them
in
the
stove
he
made
several
more
injections
of
the
same
colourless
liquid
the
night
passed
slowly
trirodov
lay
on
the
sofa
without
taking
his
clothes
off
he
slept
badly
tormented
by
oppressive
dreams
he
awoke
several
times
dmitry
matov
lay
in
the
next
room
on
the
floor
the
liquid
injected
into
his
blood
acted
strangely
the
body
contracted
in
proper
proportion
and
wasted
very
quickly
within
several
hours
it
lost
more
than
half
of
its
weight
and
assumed
very
small
dimensions
it
became
very
soft
and
pliant
but
all
its
proportions
were
faithfully
preserved
trirodov
made
up
the
body
into
a
large
parcel
covered
it
over
with
plaid
and
bound
it
with
straps
it
resembled
a
pillow
wrapped
up
in
plaid
trirodov
left
by
the
morning
train
for
home
carrying
with
him
dmitry
matov
s
body
at
home
trirodov
put
the
body
into
a
vessel
containing
a
greenish
liquid
compounded
by
himself
matov
s
body
shrunk
in
it
even
more
it
had
become
barely
more
than
seven
inches
long
but
as
before
all
its
proportions
remained
inviolate
then
trirodov
prepared
a
special
plastic
substance
in
which
he
wrapped
matov
s
body
he
pressed
it
compactly
into
the
form
of
a
cube
and
placed
it
on
his
and
thus
a
thing
that
once
had
been
a
man
remained
there
a
thing
among
other
things
nevertheless
trirodov
was
right
when
he
told
ostrov
that
matov
had
not
been
killed
yes
notwithstanding
his
strange
form
and
his
distressing
immobility
dmitry
matov
was
not
dead
the
potentiality
of
life
slept
dormant
in
that
solid
object
trirodov
thought
more
than
once
as
to
whether
the
time
had
not
come
to
rehabilitate
matov
and
return
him
to
the
world
of
the
living
he
had
not
decided
upon
this
before
but
he
was
confident
that
he
would
succeed
in
doing
this
without
hindrance
the
process
of
rehabilitation
required
a
tranquil
and
isolated
place
in
a
little
more
than
a
year
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
trirodov
decided
to
begin
the
process
of
rehabilitation
he
prepared
a
large
vat
over
six
feet
in
length
he
filled
it
with
a
colourless
liquid
and
lowered
into
it
the
cube
containing
matov
s
body
the
slow
process
of
rehabilitation
began
unperceived
by
the
eye
the
cube
began
to
thaw
and
to
swell
it
needed
a
before
it
would
thaw
out
sufficiently
to
permit
the
body
to
peer
through
chapter
xxii
sonya
svetilovitch
was
badly
shaken
by
the
hard
cruel
events
of
that
night
in
the
woods
she
fell
ill
and
remained
two
weeks
in
an
unconscious
state
it
was
feared
that
she
would
die
but
she
was
a
strong
girl
and
conquered
her
illness
scenes
from
that
nightmarish
occasion
passed
before
the
poor
girl
in
her
heavy
delirium
grey
ferocious
demons
with
dim
tinny
eyes
came
to
her
taunted
her
and
acted
without
reason
there
was
no
place
in
which
to
hide
from
the
hideous
frenzy
deep
oppression
reigned
in
the
svetilovitch
house
sonya
s
mother
wept
and
bewailed
her
lot
sonya
s
father
spoke
of
the
matter
warmly
and
eloquently
with
gesticulations
to
his
friends
in
his
study
and
inevitably
got
into
a
state
of
indignation
sonya
s
little
brothers
discussed
plans
of
vengeance
fr√§ulein
berta
the
governess
of
sonya
s
younger
sister
made
censorious
remarks
about
barbarous
russia
all
the
acquaintances
of
the
svetilovitches
were
also
indignant
but
their
indignation
assumed
only
platonic
forms
perhaps
it
was
impossible
for
it
to
have
been
otherwise
to
be
sure
all
the
more
or
less
independent
people
in
town
paid
the
svetilovitches
visits
of
sympathy
even
the
liberal
inspector
of
taxes
came
he
was
a
patient
of
doctor
svetilovitch
s
and
came
during
the
reception
hour
to
express
his
interest
incidentally
he
asked
advice
about
his
physical
indispositions
and
paid
no
fee
in
view
of
its
being
a
visit
of
sympathy
sonya
s
father
doctor
sergey
lvovitch
svetilovitch
was
a
member
of
the
constitutional
democratic
party
among
his
own
he
was
regarded
as
belonging
to
the
extreme
left
wing
like
his
friend
rameyev
who
was
a
cadet
of
more
moderate
views
he
was
a
member
of
the
local
committee
doctor
svetilovitch
thought
he
ought
to
protest
against
the
improper
actions
of
the
police
he
lodged
complaints
with
the
governor
and
the
district
attorney
and
wrote
circumstantial
petitions
to
both
his
chief
concern
being
that
no
offending
expression
of
any
sort
should
enter
into
them
doctor
svetilovitch
was
an
extremely
correct
and
loyal
man
other
people
around
him
if
placed
in
unusual
circumstances
might
lose
their
presence
of
mind
and
forget
their
principles
others
around
him
friends
or
enemies
might
act
incorrectly
and
illegally
but
doctor
svetilovitch
always
remained
faithful
to
himself
no
circumstance
no
earthly
or
heavenly
power
could
swerve
him
from
the
path
which
he
acknowledged
as
the
only
true
one
in
so
far
as
it
conformed
to
constitutional
democratic
principles
the
problem
of
expedience
of
conduct
concerned
doctor
svetilovitch
but
little
the
important
thing
was
to
be
correct
in
principle
he
always
placed
however
the
responsibility
for
the
result
this
procedure
achieved
upon
the
shoulders
of
those
who
wished
to
follow
along
other
lines
that
was
why
doctor
svetilovitch
enjoyed
extraordinary
respect
in
his
own
party
great
weight
was
attached
to
his
opinions
and
in
the
matter
of
tactics
his
declarations
were
indisputable
several
days
after
doctor
svetilovitch
presented
his
petition
he
had
a
call
from
an
inspector
of
the
police
who
handed
him
with
a
request
for
a
receipt
a
grey
rough
paper
impressed
at
the
upper
corner
with
the
stamp
of
the
skorodozh
governing
authorities
together
with
a
packet
from
the
district
attorney
this
last
contained
a
white
page
of
foolscap
folded
in
four
handsomely
engraved
with
the
district
attorney
s
seal
both
the
grey
rough
paper
and
the
page
of
foolscap
contained
approximately
in
the
same
words
the
answers
to
the
complaints
of
doctor
svetilovitch
these
informed
doctor
svetilovitch
that
a
very
careful
investigation
had
been
made
in
connexion
with
his
complaints
in
conclusion
it
was
affirmed
that
doctor
svetilovitch
s
evidence
as
to
the
illegal
actions
of
the
police
and
as
to
the
subjection
of
the
girls
caught
in
the
woods
to
blows
was
not
borne
out
by
facts
at
last
sonya
began
to
improve
the
members
of
the
family
and
acquaintances
tried
not
to
recall
the
sad
incident
of
that
night
before
sonya
only
indifferent
and
pleasant
matters
were
mentioned
in
the
poor
girl
s
presence
in
order
to
divert
her
a
number
of
visitors
were
invited
one
evening
for
this
purpose
some
were
asked
by
letter
others
by
doctor
svetilovitch
in
person
he
visited
the
rameyevs
and
trirodov
in
his
carriage
which
was
harnessed
to
a
pair
of
stout
ponies
in
inviting
trirodov
doctor
svetilovitch
asked
him
to
read
something
from
his
own
work
at
the
gathering
something
that
would
not
make
sonya
unpleasantly
reminiscent
trirodov
agreed
to
this
quite
heartily
although
he
usually
avoided
reading
his
own
work
anywhere
as
trirodov
was
preparing
to
leave
his
house
that
evening
and
was
putting
on
a
coloured
tie
kirsha
said
to
him
with
his
usual
gravity
i
should
not
go
to
the
svetilovitches
if
i
were
you
it
would
be
much
wiser
to
remain
at
trirodov
not
all
astonished
by
this
unexpected
advice
smiled
and
asked
why
shouldn
t
i
go
kirsha
held
his
father
s
hand
and
said
sadly
there
have
been
many
detectives
of
late
poking
their
noses
about
here
what
can
they
want
here
it
s
almost
certain
they
will
make
a
search
of
svetilovitch
s
house
i
have
a
that
s
nothing
said
trirodov
with
a
smile
we
have
got
used
to
everything
but
dear
kirsha
you
are
very
inquisitive
you
look
in
everywhere
even
where
you
shouldn
my
eyes
see
and
my
ears
hear
replied
kirsha
is
that
my
fault
in
the
pleasant
of
the
svetilovitches
in
the
lifeless
light
of
three
electric
globes
with
lustrous
bronze
fittings
the
upholsterings
of
the
empire
furniture
seemed
illusively
beautiful
the
dark
curves
of
the
grand
piano
were
gleaming
albums
were
lying
on
a
little
table
under
the
leaves
of
a
palm
the
portrait
of
an
old
man
with
a
long
white
moustache
smiled
down
youthfully
and
cheerfully
from
its
place
on
the
wall
above
the
sofa
the
visitors
gathered
in
the
midst
of
these
attractive
surroundings
as
if
there
were
nothing
to
mar
them
they
spoke
a
great
deal
with
much
heat
and
eloquence
most
of
the
visitors
were
local
cadets
among
those
present
were
three
physicians
one
engineer
two
legal
advocates
the
editor
of
a
local
progressive
newspaper
a
justice
of
the
peace
a
notary
three
gymnasia
instructors
and
a
priest
nearly
all
came
accompanied
by
women
and
girls
there
were
also
several
students
college
girls
and
grownup
schoolboys
from
the
higher
gymnasia
classes
the
young
priest
nikolai
matveyevitch
zakrasin
who
sympathized
with
the
cadets
gave
lessons
in
trirodov
s
school
he
was
considered
a
great
freethinker
among
his
colleagues
the
priests
the
town
clergy
looked
askance
at
him
and
the
diocesan
bishop
was
not
well
disposed
towards
him
father
zakrasin
had
completed
a
course
in
the
ecclesiastical
academy
he
spoke
rather
well
wrote
something
and
collaborated
not
only
in
religious
but
also
in
worldly
periodicals
he
had
wavy
dense
not
hair
his
grey
eyes
smiled
amiably
and
cheerfully
his
priestly
attire
always
appeared
new
and
neat
his
manners
were
restrained
and
gentle
he
did
not
at
all
resemble
the
average
russian
priest
father
zakrasin
seemed
more
like
a
catholic
prelate
who
had
let
his
beard
grow
and
had
put
on
a
golden
pectoral
cross
father
zakrasin
s
house
was
bright
neat
and
cheerful
the
walls
were
decorated
with
engravings
scenes
from
sacred
history
his
study
contained
several
cases
of
books
it
was
evident
from
their
selection
that
father
zakrasin
s
interests
were
very
broad
in
general
he
liked
that
which
was
certain
convincing
and
rational
his
wife
susanna
kirillovna
a
plump
and
calm
woman
who
was
wholly
convinced
of
the
justice
of
the
cadets
cause
was
now
sitting
quietly
on
the
sofa
in
the
svetilovitch
and
expounding
truths
notwithstanding
her
constitutional
democratic
convictions
she
was
a
real
priest
s
spouse
a
housewifely
loquacious
timorous
creature
priest
zakrasin
s
sister
irina
matveyevna
or
irinushka
as
every
one
called
her
was
a
girl
who
had
been
won
over
to
the
cause
by
the
priest
s
wife
she
was
young
rosy
and
slender
and
greatly
resembled
her
brother
she
got
excited
so
often
and
so
intensely
that
she
constantly
had
to
be
appeased
by
the
elders
who
regarded
her
youthful
impetuosity
with
benevolent
amusement
rameyev
was
there
with
both
his
daughters
the
matov
brothers
and
miss
harrison
trirodov
was
there
also
there
was
almost
a
spirit
of
gaiety
they
talked
on
various
subjects
on
politics
on
literature

sonya
s
mother
liked
this
writer
intensely
and
loved
to
tell
about
her
meeting
with
him
abroad
there
was
an
autographed
portrait
of
knut
hamsun
upon
her
table
and
it
was
the
object
of
much
pride
for
the
whole
svetilovitch
family
at
the
in
the
small
neighbouring
room
which
was
called
the
buffet
sonya
surrounded
by
young
people
was
pouring
out
tea
in
doctor
svetilovitch
s
study
they
spoke
of
the
recent
unrest
in
villages
there
were
incendiary
fires
on
various
estates
and
farms
belonging
to
the
landed
gentry
there
were
several
cases
in
which
the
bread
granaries
belonging
to
certain
hoarders
were
broken
into
sonya
s
mother
was
asked
to
play
something
she
refused
a
long
time
but
finally
with
evident
pleasure
went
to
the
grand
piano
and
played
a
selection
from
grieg
then
the
notary
took
his
turn
at
the
instrument
irinushka
blushing
furiously
sang
with
much
expression
the
new
popular
song
to
his
accompaniment
i
loved
a
learned
student
i
admit
i
wasn
t
prudent
on
the
day
i
married
him
the
village
feasted
to
the
brim
vodka
every
one
was
drinking
all
were
doing
loud
thinking
how
to
make
the
masters
toil
and
amongst
us
share
their
soil
suddenly
there
came
a
copper
right
into
our
hut
i
ll
send
you
both
to
sakhalin
for
raising
this
rebellious
well
my
dear
one
quick
get
ready
mind
that
you
walk
long
there
steady
for
your
charming
words
my
sweet
a
gaol
is
waiting
you
to
do
you
think
i
was
agitated
no
not
me
i
was
most
elated
then
the
muzhiks
stepped
right
in
and
chucked
him
out
on
the
this
song
was
an
illustration
appropriate
to
the
discussions
on
village
tendencies
it
achieved
a
great
success
irinushka
was
profusely
praised
and
thanked
for
it
irinushka
blushed
and
regretted
that
she
knew
no
other
songs
of
the
same
kind
then
trirodov
read
his
story
of
a
beautiful
and
exultant
love
he
read
simply
and
calmly
not
as
actors
read
he
finished
reading
and
in
the
cold
polite
praises
he
felt
how
remote
he
was
from
all
these
people
once
more
as
it
frequently
had
happened
before
there
stirred
in
his
soul
the
thought
why
do
i
come
to
see
these
people
there
is
so
little
in
common
between
them
and
me
thought
trirodov
only
elisaveta
s
smile
and
word
consoled
him
afterwards
there
was
dancing
then
it
was
as
always
as
everywhere
chapter

no
one
else
was
expected
the
table
was
being
set
for
supper
suddenly
there
was
a
loud
violent
the
housemaid
ran
quickly
to
answer
it
some
one
in
the
remarked
in
astonishment
a
rather
late
every
one
suddenly
felt
depressed
for
some
reason
there
was
an
air
of
ominous
expectancy
were
robbers
about
to
break
in
was
it
a
telegram
containing
an
unpleasant
announcement
or
would
some
one
come
in
panting
and
exhausted
and
divulge
a
piece
of
terrible
news
but
the
words
they
addressed
to
each
other
were
of
quite
a
different
nature
but
who
can
it
be
at
such
a
late
hour
said
one
woman
to
another
who
else
can
it
be
but
piotr
ivanitch
that
s
so
he
likes
coming
do
you
remember
once
at
the
taranovs
piotr
ivanitch
approaching
at
that
moment
overheard
the
remark
you
are
unfair
to
me
marya
ivanovna
i
ve
been
here
a
long
time
said
he
forgive
me
but
who
then
can
it
be
said
marya
ivanovna
in
confusion
we
ll
soon
know
let
s
take
a
the
inquisitive
engineer
put
his
head
out
into
the
hall
and
stumbled
upon
some
one
in
a
grey
uniform
who
was
walking
impetuously
towards
the
some
one
whispered
in
suppressed
horror
the
police
when
the
maid
in
response
to
the
ring
opened
the
door
several
men
filed
into
the
hall
awkwardly
jostling
one
another
gendarmes
detectives
an
inspector
of
the
police
an
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
two
petty
constables
the
maid
stood
speechless
with
fright
the
police
inspector
shouted
at
her
get
back
to
the
kitchen
a
detachment
of
policemen
and
porters
remained
outside
under
the
command
of
the
inspector
of
the
constabulary
they
watched
to
see
that
no
one
entered
or
left
the
svetilovitch
house
altogether
about
twenty
policemen
entered
the
house
for
some
unknown
reason
they
were
armed
with
rifles
with
fixed
bayonets
three
men
in
civilian
clothes
kept
close
to
the
policemen
these
were
the
detectives
two
policemen
stationed
themselves
at
the
entrance
two
others
ran
to
the
telephone
which
was
attached
to
a
wall
in
the
hall
it
was
evident
that
everything
had
been
arranged
beforehand
by
a
manager
expert
in
such
matters
the
rest
of
the
men
tumbled
into
the
the
inspector
of
the
police
stretched
his
neck
and
assuming
a
tense
red
expression
and
bulging
his
eyes
shouted
very
loudly
don
t
any
one
dare
to
move
from
his
place
and
he
looked
round
in
at
the
officer
of
the
gendarmerie
the
men
and
the
women
remained
transfixed
in
their
places
as
if
they
were
acting
a
tableau
they
were
looking
silently
at
the
the
policemen
awkwardly
holding
their
rifles
tramped
with
their
ponderous
boots
on
the
and
made
their
way
about
the
rooms
they
paused
at
all
the
doors
looked
at
the
visitors
timorously
and
savagely
uneasily
pressed
the
barrels
of
their
rifles
and
tried
to
look
like
real
soldiers
it
was
evident
that
these
zealous
people
were
ready
to
fire
at
any
one
whomsoever
at
the
first
suspicious
movement
they
thought
that
a
band
of
conspirators
had
gathered
here
all
the
rooms
were
overrun
with
these
strangers
it
began
to
smell
of
bad
tobacco
sweat
and
vodka
many
of
them
drank
to
keep
their
courage
up
they
were
afraid
of
a
possible
armed
resistance
a
gendarme
placed
his
colonel
s
voluminous
portfolio
on
the
grand
piano
in
the
the
colonel
stepping
forward
to
the
middle
of
the
room
so
that
the
light
of
the
centre
cluster
of
lamps
fell
almost
directly
upon
his
bald
forehead
and
upon
his
bushy
moustache
pronounced
in
an
official
tone
where
s
the
master
of
this
house
he
made
a
determined
effort
to
give
the
impression
that
he
did
not
know
doctor
svetilovitch
or
the
others
actually
he
knew
nearly
all
of
them
personally
doctor
svetilovitch
walked
up
to
him
i
am
the
master
of
this
house
i
am
doctor
svetilovitch
he
said
in
a
no
less
official
tone
the
colonel
in
the
blue
uniform
then
announced
m
svetilovitch
it
is
my
duty
to
make
a
search
of
your
doctor
svetilovitch
asked
under
whose
authority
are
you
doing
this
and
where
is
your
warrant
for
carrying
out
the
search
the
colonel
of
the
gendarmerie
turned
towards
the
piano
and
rummaged
in
his
portfolio
but
produced
nothing
he
said
i
assure
you
i
have
an
order
if
you
have
any
doubts
you
can
call
up
on
the
then
the
colonel
turned
to
the
inspector
of
the
police
and
said
please
collect
them
all
in
one
all
except
doctor
svetilovitch
were
compelled
to
go
into
the
which
now
became
crowded
and
uncomfortable
armed
constables
were
placed
at
both
doors
the
one
entering
the
hall
and
the
other
the
as
well
as
in
all
the
corners
their
faces
were
dull
and
their
guns
seemed
unnecessary
and
absurd
in
these
peaceful
surroundings
but
then
the
guests
felt
even
more
uncomfortable
a
detective
looked
out
from
time
to
time
from
the
door
he
looked
searchingly
into
the
faces
the
look
he
had
on
his
disagreeable
face
with
its
white
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
gave
the
impression
that
he
was
sniffing
the
air
in
the
the
colonel
of
the
gendarmerie
was
saying
to
doctor
svetilovitch
and
now
svetilovitch
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
with
what
object
you
have
arranged
this
gathering
doctor
svetilovitch
replied
with
an
ironic
smile
with
the
object
of
dancing
and
dining
nothing
more
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
we
are
all
peaceable
very
well
said
the
colonel
in
an
authoritative
rude
tone
are
the
names
and
families
of
all
gathered
here
with
the
object
you
state
known
to
you
doctor
svetilovitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
astonishment
and
replied
of
course
they
are
known
to
me
why
shouldn
t
i
know
my
own
guests
i
believe
you
know
many
of
them
be
so
good
requested
the
colonel
as
to
give
me
the
names
of
all
your
he
produced
a
sheet
of
paper
from
his
portfolio
and
placed
it
on
the
piano
the
colonel
wrote
the
names
down
as
doctor
svetilovitch
gave
them
when
the
doctor
stopped
short
the
colonel
asked
laconically
all
doctor
svetilovitch
answered
as
briefly
show
us
into
your
study
said
the
colonel
they
went
into
the
study
and
rummaged
among
everything
there
they
turned
over
all
the
books
and
disarranged
the
they
looked
through
the
letters
the
colonel
demanded
open
the
bookcases
the
bureau
doctor
svetilovitch
answered
the
keys
as
you
see
are
in
their
places
in
the
he
put
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
stood
by
the
window
will
you
be
good
enough
to
open
them
said
the
colonel
i
can
t
do
this
replied
doctor
svetilovitch
i
do
not
consider
it
obligatory
to
help
you
in
your
pride
filled
his
cadet
s
soul
he
felt
that
he
was
behaving
correctly
and
valiantly
what
was
the
consequence
the
uninvited
guests
opened
everything
themselves
and
rummaged
where
they
pleased
a
constable
put
aside
all
those
books
which
looked
suspicious
several
of
these
books
had
been
published
in
russia
quite
openly
and
sold
no
less
openly
they
took
several
books
wholly
innocent
in
their
contents
simply
because
they
thought
they
detected
a
rebellious
note
in
their
titles
the
colonel
of
the
gendarmerie
announced
we
will
take
the
correspondence
and
the
manuscripts
with
doctor
svetilovitch
said
in
vexation
i
assure
you
there
s
nothing
criminal
there
the
manuscripts
are
very
necessary
to
my
we
ll
have
a
look
at
them
said
the
colonel
dryly
don
t
be
concerned
about
them
they
will
be
kept
in
then
they
rummaged
the
other
rooms
they
searched
the
beds
to
see
if
there
were
any
concealed
when
he
returned
into
the
study
the
colonel
of
the
gendarmerie
said
to
doctor
svetilovitch
well
try
and
see
if
you
can
find
the
papers
of
the
strike
i
have
no
such
papers
replied
doctor
svetilovitch
now
said
the
colonel
very
significantly
tell
us
frankly
where
you
keep
the
weapons
what
weapons
asked
doctor
svetilovitch
in
astonishment
the
colonel
replied
with
an
ironic
smile
any
sort
that
you
may
have
about
revolvers
bombs
or
i
haven
t
any
kind
of
weapons
said
doctor
svetilovitch
with
an
amused
laugh
i
haven
t
even
a
gun
for
hunting
what
kind
of
weapon
can
i
possibly
have
we
ll
have
a
look
said
the
colonel
in
a
meaningful
voice
they
turned
the
whole
house
upside
down
of
course
they
found
no
weapons
of
any
kind
while
all
this
was
going
on
trirodov
was
reading
in
the
his
own
verses
and
some
which
were
not
his
the
constables
listened
in
a
dull
way
they
did
not
understand
anything
but
waited
patiently
to
see
if
any
rebellious
words
were
mentioned
but
their
waiting
remained
unrewarded
the
inspector
of
the
police
then
entered
the
every
one
looked
guardedly
at
him
he
said
solemnly
as
if
he
were
announcing
the
beginning
of
an
important
and
useful
work
gentlemen
now
we
must
subject
all
those
present
to
a
personal
examination
one
at
a
time
please
suppose
we
begin
with
you
said
he
turning
to
the
engineer
the
face
of
the
inspector
of
the
police
expressed
a
consciousness
of
his
personal
dignity
his
movements
were
sure
and
significant
it
was
evident
that
he
not
only
was
not
ashamed
of
what
he
was
saying
and
doing
but
that
he
had
not
the
slightest
comprehension
that
there
was
anything
in
this
to
be
ashamed
of
the
engineer
a
young
and
handsome
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
smiled
contemptuously
and
went
into
the
study
being
directed
there
by
an
awkward
motion
of
the
paw
of
the
commissary
of
the
rural
police
the
priest
s
wife
found
herself
an
in
the
but
she
was
not
any
more
comfortable
in
it
terrified
in
her
she
trembled
like
jelly
with
pale
lips
she
whispered
to
the
girl
she
had
won
over
to
the
cause
irinushka
dearest
think
of
it
they
are
going
to
search
us
the
girl
irinushka
looking
slender
fresh
and
red
like
a
newly
washed
carrot
moved
her
ears
in
her
fright
a
faculty
which
her
companions
envied
her
intensely
and
whispered
something
to
the
priest
s
wife
the
constable
looked
savagely
at
the
priest
s
wife
and
at
the
girl
and
cried
out
in
a
shrill
somewhat
hoarse
voice
which
resembled
the
crowing
of
a
cock
i
must
very
humbly
ask
you
not
to
the
constables
with
the
guns
pricked
up
their
ears
their
sudden
zeal
made
them
perspire
the
priest
s
wife
and
the
girl
almost
fainted
from
fright
but
the
girl
at
once
recovered
herself
and
began
to
get
angry
she
was
now
even
more
angry
than
she
had
been
frightened
a
little
while
ago
small
tears
gleamed
in
her
eyes
small
drops
of
perspiration
appeared
on
her
cheeks
and
on
her
forehead
the
angry
girl
s
face
grew
even
redder
so
that
now
she
resembled
no
longer
a
carrot
but
a
wet
beetroot
the
only
person
in
the
room
to
be
refreshingly
and
youthfully
indignant
and
all
aflame
with
a
deep
anger
she
looked
truly
beautiful
in
her
ingenuous
exasperation
here
is
something
new
she
cried
whispering
is
forbidden
are
you
afraid
that
we
will
say
something
against
you
that
we
will
hurt
you
at
this
moment
all
the
cadets
and
their
wives
and
daughters
who
were
sitting
around
the
table
and
against
the
walls
turned
their
horrified
faces
at
the
girl
and
all
together
hissed
at
her
they
would
have
laid
hands
on
her
some
one
would
have
gagged
her
mouth
but
not
one
of
them
dared
to
make
a
move
they
sat
motionless
looked
at
the
girl
with
eyes
dilated
with
fear
and
hissed
the
girl
overcome
with
fright
grew
silent
only
the
hissing
could
be
heard
in
the
even
the
constables
began
to
smile
at
the
friendly
hissing
of
the
cadets
of
both
sexes
when
they
had
finished
hissing
irinushka
said
almost
tranquilly
we
didn
t
whisper
anything
criminal
i
only
said
about
you
constable
that
you
were
fascinatingly
handsome
with
your
dark
when
she
saw
that
the
rameyev
sisters
were
laughing
irinushka
turned
to
elisaveta
you
do
agree
with
me
vetochka
that
the
constable
is
a
fascinatingly
handsome
man
the
constable
flushed
he
was
not
sure
whether
the
blushing
girl
was
laughing
at
him
or
in
earnest
in
any
case
he
frowned
vigorously
twirled
his
dark
moustache
and
exclaimed
i
must
humbly
ask
you
not
to
express
later
at
home
irinushka
was
scolded
for
her
behaviour
regarded
as
untactful
by
priest
zakrasin
the
priest
s
wife
was
especially
angry
poor
irinushka
even
cried
several
times
but
this
was
later
at
this
particular
instant
the
inspector
of
the
police
and
the
colonel
of
the
gendarmerie
were
sitting
in
doctor
svetilovitch
s
study
and
were
examining
the
guests
one
by
one
they
turned
their
pockets
inside
out
and
for
some
unknown
reason
deprived
their
owners
of
letters
notes
and
notebooks
rameyev
was
in
a
quiet
genial
mood
he
laughed
on
being
searched
trirodov
made
an
effort
to
be
calm
and
was
a
little
sharper
than
he
wished
to
be
the
women
were
searched
in
one
of
the
bedrooms
a
was
brought
for
this
purpose
she
was
a
dirty
cunning
sycophant
the
contact
of
her
coarse
hands
was
repulsive
elisaveta
felt
uncomfortably
unclean
after
she
had
passed
through
the
policewoman
s
paws
elena
shivered
with
fear
and
nausea
those
who
had
been
searched
were
not
permitted
to
enter
the
but
were
led
into
the
nearly
all
the
searched
ones
were
proud
of
this
they
looked
as
if
they
were
celebrating
a
birthday
no
one
was
arrested
they
began
to
draw
up
the
official
report
trirodov
quietly
addressed
a
gendarme
but
the
latter
replied
in
a
whisper
we
are
not
permitted
to
enter
into
conversation
with
any
one
those
scoundrelly
spies
are
watching
us
so
that
we
shouldn
t
speak
with
liberals
they
are
quick
to
inform
against
you
are
in
an
unfortunate
business
said
trirodov
the
inspector
of
the
police
read
the
official
report
aloud
it
was
signed
by
doctor
svetilovitch
the
inspector
and
the
witnesses
when
the
uninvited
guests
left
the
hosts
and
the
invited
guests
sat
down
to
supper
it
was
presently
discovered
that
the
beer
prepared
for
the
occasion
had
been
consumed
at
the
same
time
the
cap
of
one
of
the
guests
had
disappeared
its
owner
was
very
much
disturbed
the
cap
became
almost
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
on
the
next
day
there
was
much
talk
in
town
about
the
search
at
the
svetilovitches
the
consumed
beer
and
especially
about
the
lost
cap
not
a
little
was
said
in
the
newspapers
about
the
beer
and
the
cap
one
newspaper
in
petersburg
devoted
a
very
heated
article
to
the
stolen
cap
the
author
of
the
article
made
very
broad
generalizations
he
asked
is
it
not
one
of
those
caps
with
which
we
were
preparing
to
throw
back
the
foreign
enemy
is
not
all
russia
seeking
now
its
lost
cap
and
can
not
be
consoled
much
less
was
said
and
written
about
the
consumed
beer
for
some
reason
or
other
it
did
not
offend
people
so
much
in
accordance
with
our
general
custom
of
placing
substance
above
the
form
it
was
found
that
the
stealing
of
the
cap
deserved
the
greater
protest
inasmuch
as
it
is
more
difficult
to
get
along
without
a
cap
than
without
beer
chapter
xxiv
once
more
alone
he
sat
in
his
room
musing
of
her
recalling
her
dear
features
there
was
an
album
before
him
portrait
after
portrait
of
her
naked
beautiful
calling
to
love
to
the
sweet
solace
of
love
would
this
white
breast
cease
heaving
would
these
clear
eyes
grow
dim
she
died
trirodov
closed
the
album
for
a
long
time
he
remained
immersed
in
thought
suddenly
there
was
a
rustling
behind
the
wall
which
gradually
grew
louder
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
house
were
alive
with
the
movements
of
the
quiet
children
some
one
knocked
on
the
door
kirsha
entered
distraught
he
said
father
let
us
go
into
the
wood
as
fast
as
we
trirodov
looked
at
him
in
silence
kirsha
went
on
something
terrible
is
happening
there
near
the
hollow
by
the
elisaveta
s
blue
eyes
appeared
to
him
suddenly
as
in
a
flame
where
was
she
was
she
in
a
difficulty
and
his
heart
fell
into
the
dark
abyss
of
fear
kirsha
made
haste
he
almost
cried
in
his
agitation
they
went
on
horseback
they
whipped
up
their
horses
they
feared
they
might
be
too
late
again
the
quiet
dark
intensely
pensive
wood
elisaveta
walked
alone
tranquil
simple
in
her
dress
harmonious
in
the
graceful
harmony
of
her
deep
experiences
she
fell
into
thought
she
recalled
things
and
mused
upon
them
her
dreams
were
revealed
in
the
gleam
of
her
blue
eyes
dreams
of
happiness
and
of
passionate
love
were
interwoven
with
a
different
greater
love
and
these
melted
into
one
another
in
the
fiery
longing
for
noble
activity
and
sacrifice
what
did
she
not
recall
what
did
she
not
dream
of
sharp
swords
were
being
forged
to
whose
lot
would
they
fall
the
high
standard
of
solitary
freedom
was
fluttering
youths
and
maidens
there
in
the
dark
halls
of
his
house
proud
plans
were
being
made
what
a
beautiful
environment
of
naked
beauty
there
were
the
children
happy
and
beautiful
in
the
wood
there
were
the
quiet
children
in
his
house
radiant
and
lovable
and
touched
with
such
sadness
there
was
the
strange
kirsha
portraits
of
his
first
wife
naked
and
beautiful
elisaveta
s
blue
eyes
gleamed
dreamily
she
recalled
the
details
of
the
previous
evening
the
remote
room
in
trirodov
s
house
the
small
gathering
in
it
the
long
discussions
the
subsequent
labours
the
measured
knock
of
the
the
damp
pages
put
into
portfolios
then
she
thought
how
she
stchemilov
voronok
and
some
one
else
walked
out
into
the
various
streets
of
the
town
to
paste
up
the
bills
they
put
the
paste
on
while
still
walking
they
always
took
a
look
round
first
to
see
that
no
one
was
in
sight
then
they
would
pause
and
quickly
stick
the
bill
on
the
fence
they
would
go
on
farther
the
effort
had
been
successful
elisaveta
did
not
think
where
she
was
going
she
had
walked
quite
far
out
of
her
way
to
a
place
that
she
had
not
been
to
before
she
imagined
that
the
quiet
children
were
keeping
guard
over
her
she
walked
trustfully
in
the
forest
silence
yielding
her
bare
feet
to
the
caresses
of
the
moist
forest
grasses
and
now
listened
now
ceased
listening
in
delicious
drowsiness
something
rustled
behind
the
bushes
some
one
s
nimble
feet
were
running
behind
the
light
undergrowth
suddenly
she
heard
a
loud
laugh
almost
at
her
ears
it
broke
into
her
sweet
reverie
with
such
a
violent
suddenness
like
the
trumpet
of
an
archangel
calling
to
wake
the
dear
dead
on
judgment
day
elisaveta
felt
some
one
s
hot
breath
on
her
neck
a
rough
perspiring
hand
caught
her
by
her
bared
forearm
it
was
as
if
elisaveta
had
suddenly
awakened
from
a
pleasant
dream
she
raised
her
frightened
eyes
and
paused
like
one
bewitched
two
vigorous
ragged
men
stood
before
her
they
were
both
handsome
young
fellows
one
of
them
was
astonishingly
handsome
swarthy
both
were
barely
covered
by
their
dirty
rags
the
openings
in
which
showed
their
dirty
perspiring
powerful
bodies
the
men
were
laughing
and
crying
insolently
we
ve
caught
you
this
time
pretty
one
we
ll
fondle
you
to
your
heart
s
content
you
shan
t
forget
us
so
soon
they
drew
closer
and
closer
to
her
and
blew
their
hot
breath
upon
her
elisaveta
suddenly
came
to
herself
tore
herself
away
with
a
quick
movement
and
began
to
run
a
horror
akin
to
wonder
swung
the
resounding
bell
in
her
breast
her
heavily
beating
heart
it
hindered
her
running
and
there
was
a
beating
of
sharp
little
hammers
under
her
knees
the
two
men
quickly
overtook
her
and
as
they
obstructed
her
passage
they
laughed
insolently
and
said
ah
my
beauty
don
t
make
a
fuss
you
won
t
get
away
they
jostled
one
another
as
they
pulled
elisaveta
about
each
towards
himself
and
acted
altogether
awkwardly
as
if
they
did
not
know
who
should
begin
and
how
their
sensual
panting
bared
their
white
teeth
vigorous
as
those
of
a
wild
beast
the
beauty
of
the
swarthy
man
tempted
elisaveta
it
was
a
sudden
piquant
temptation
acting
like
a
poison
the
handsome
man
his
voice
hoarse
with
agitation
shouted
tear
her
clothes
let
her
dance
naked
before
us
and
make
our
eyes
she
hasn
t
much
on
the
other
responded
with
a
gay
laugh
he
caught
the
broad
collar
of
elisaveta
s
dress
with
one
hand
and
jerked
it
forward
he
thrust
the
other
hand
large
hot
and
perspiring
under
her
chemise
and
pressed
and
squeezed
her
taut
young
breast
two
men
against
one
woman
aren
t
you
ashamed
said
elisaveta
don
t
be
ashamed
my
lass
and
lie
down
on
the
grass
exclaimed
the
handsome
swarthy
one
with
a
laugh
very
much
like
a
horse
s
neigh
his
white
teeth
gleamed
his
eyes
flamed
with
desire
as
he
tore
elisaveta
s
clothes
with
his
hands
and
his
teeth
the
red
and
the
white
roses
of
her
body
were
soon
bared
the
sensual
breathing
of
the
assailants
was
horrible
and
repugnant
to
her
and
she
found
it
no
less
horrible
and
repugnant
to
look
at
their
perspiring
faces
at
the
gleaming
of
their
enkindled
eyes
but
their
beauty
was
tempting
in
the
dark
depths
of
her
consciousness
a
thought
struggled
to
yield
herself
to
yield
willingly
her
dress
and
chemise
flimsy
of
texture
ripped
with
a
barely
audible
noise
elisaveta
struggled
desperately
and
shouted
something
she
did
not
remember
what
all
her
clothes
were
already
torn
and
soon
the
last
shreds
of
her
very
light
garments
fell
from
her
naked
body
and
in
the
struggle
the
rags
of
the
two
clumsily
moving
men
ripped
with
a
loud
splitting
sound
their
sudden
nakedness
rousing
them
even
more
there
was
seductiveness
for
elisaveta
in
the
nakedness
of
these
impetuous
bodies
she
taunted
them
the
two
of
you
can
t
manage
one
she
was
strong
and
agile
it
was
difficult
for
them
to
conquer
her
her
naked
body
struggled
and
wriggled
itself
out
of
their
arms
the
blue
arch
of
her
teeth
on
the
naked
shoulder
of
the
handsome
swarthy
man
grew
red
quickly
drops
of
dark
blood
spurted
on
to
his
naked
torso
wait
you
he
cried
in
a
hoarse
voice
i
will
the
powerful
but
awkward
pair
grew
more
and
more
exasperated
they
were
enraged
and
intoxicated
by
her
extraordinary
resistance
by
the
falling
away
of
their
rags
and
their
sudden
nakedness
they
beat
elisaveta
in
the
beginning
with
their
fists
later
with
quickly
severed
branches
or
with
those
which
already
lay
on
the
ground
the
sharp
fires
of
pain
stung
her
naked
body
and
tempted
her
with
a
burning
temptation
to
yield
herself
willingly
but
she
did
not
yield
herself
her
loud
sobs
resounded
for
some
distance
around
her
the
struggle
continued
for
a
long
time
elisaveta
already
began
to
weaken
and
the
raging
passions
of
the
two
men
had
not
yet
exhausted
themselves
naked
and
savage
the
lips
of
their
wry
mouths
grown
blue
their
eyes
gleaming
dimly
they
were
on
the
point
of
drawing
her
down
to
the
ground
suddenly
the
white
quiet
boys
came
running
in
a
swarm
into
the
glade
lightly
and
noiselessly
like
a
rapid
light
summer
shower
they
appeared
so
quickly
from
among
the
bushes
and
threw
themselves
on
the
savage
pair
they
surrounded
them
cast
themselves
upon
them
threw
them
down
cast
a
sleeping
spell
upon
them
and
dragged
them
away
into
the
depth
of
the
dark
hollow
and
they
left
the
naked
bodies
sprawling
helplessly
on
the
rough
grasses
the
rapid
noiseless
movements
of
the
quiet
boys
put
elisaveta
into
a
mood
verging
on
oblivion
half
painful
and
half
sweet
what
happened
in
that
thicket
seemed
like
a
heavy
and
incredible
dream
to
elisaveta
a
sudden
and
cruel
whim
of
the
undependable
aisa
and
for
a
long
time
a
dark
horror
nestled
in
her
soul
merging
with
senseless
laughter
the
exulting
smile
of
pitiless
irony
elisaveta
came
to
herself
she
saw
above
her
the
green
branches
of
the
birches
and
the
lovely
pale
faces
she
lay
in
the
refreshing
grass
encircled
by
quiet
children
she
could
not
recall
at
once
what
had
happened
to
her
her
nakedness
was
incomprehensible
to
her
but
she
felt
no
shame
her
eyes
paused
for
a
moment
on
some
one
s
neatly
combed
fair
hair
she
recognized
klavdia
the
dissembling
instructress
she
stood
under
the
tree
her
arms
folded
and
looked
with
her
grey
eyes
gleaming
with
envy
at
elisaveta
s
naked
body
it
was
as
if
a
grey
spider
was
spinning
across
her
soul
a
grey
web
of
dull
oblivion
and
tedious
indifference
clothes
will
be
here
in
a
moment
said
one
of
the
boys
quietly
elisaveta
closed
her
eyes
and
lay
tranquilly
her
head
felt
somewhat
dizzy
fatigue
overcame
her
beautiful
and
graceful
she
lay
there
as
perfect
as
the
dream
of
don
quixote
they
were
dark
moments
and
there
fell
in
their
midst
from
the
gradually
darkening
sky
a
brief
interval
of
great
comprehension
and
this
brief
interval
became
like
an
age
from
birth
until
death
early
next
morning
elisaveta
clearly
recalled
the
course
of
this
strange
vivid
life
the
sad
lofty
road
the
life
of
queen
ortruda
and
when
suffocating
ortruda
was
dying
the
rush
of
light
feet
in
the
grass
awakened
elisaveta
light
adroit
hands
dressed
her
the
quiet
boys
helped
her
to
rise
elisaveta
rose
and
looked
around
her
a
light
green
grecian
tunic
draped
her
tired
body
within
its
broad
folds
elisaveta
thought
how
shall
i
manage
to
walk
so
far
and
as
if
in
answer
to
her
question
she
suddenly
caught
sight
of
a
light
trap
under
the
trees
some
one
said
kirsha
will
drive
you
in
her
strange
dress
elisaveta
returned
home
she
sat
silently
in
the
trap
she
did
not
even
notice
trirodov
she
was
trying
to
recall
something
through
the
dark
horror
and
senseless
laughter
there
shone
clearer
and
clearer
the
recollection
of
another
life
lived
through
momentarily
the
life
of
queen
ortruda
chapter
xxv
the
quiet
boy
grisha
stood
within
the
enclosure
of
enchanted
sadness
and
mystery
his
face
was
pale
and
reposeful
and
there
was
a
keen
quiet
sparkle
in
his
cool
eyes
the
early
evening
sky
was
growing
bluer
a
blue
reposefulness
was
pouring
itself
out
upon
the
earth
and
extinguishing
the
flames
of
the
sunset
and
silhouetted
against
the
blueness
of
the
heights
birds
were
flying
about
why
should
they
have
wings
these
earthly
preoccupied
creatures
as
he
stood
there
in
the
quiet
of
the
enclosure
grisha
felt
himself
drawn
by
the
fragrance
of
the
lilies
of
the
valley
no
less
innocent
than
he
the
quiet
grisha
it
was
as
if
some
one
were
calling
him
outside
the
enclosure
towards
the
poor
life
which
tormented
itself
in
the
blue
and
distance
calling
him
despairingly
and
agonizingly
and
he
both
wished
and
did
not
wish
to
go
some
one
s
voice
full
of
distress
called
him
wearily
to
life
outside
how
can
calls
of
distress
be
resisted
when
will
the
tranquil
heart
forget
earthly
travail
wholly
and
for
always
at
last
grisha
walked
out
of
the
gate
he
took
a
deep
breath
of
the
sharp
but
delicious
outside
air
he
walked
quietly
upon
the
narrow
dusty
path
his
light
footprints
lay
behind
him
and
his
white
clothes
glimmered
brightly
in
quiet
movement
against
the
dim
verdure
and
the
grey
dust
before
him
barely
visible
rose
the
white
lifeless
clear
moon
powerless
to
enchant
the
tedious
earthly
spaces
then
the
town
began
the
grey
dull
tiresome
town
with
its
dirty
back
yards
consumptive
vegetable
gardens
hedges
bathhouses
and
sheds
and
all
manner
of
ugly
projections
and
depressing
amorphousness
all
of
it
resembling
a
hopeless
ruin
egorka
the
son
of
a
local
commoner
stood
by
the
hedge
of
one
of
the
vegetable
gardens
what
had
been
red
calico
once
made
up
his
torn
shirt
but
his
face
it
was
like
that
of
an
angel
in
a
tawny
mask
covered
with
spots
of
dirt
and
dust
wings
are
for
light
feet
but
what
can
the
earth
do
only
dust
and
clay
cling
to
light
feet
egorka
had
come
out
to
play
he
waited
for
his
companions
but
for
some
reason
none
of
them
was
to
be
seen
he
stood
alone
there
now
listening
to
this
now
looking
at
that
he
suddenly
espied
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
an
unknown
quiet
boy
who
all
in
white
was
looking
at
him
egorka
asked
in
astonishment
where
do
you
come
from
you
can
never
know
said
grisha
don
t
be
too
sure
of
that
shouted
egorka
gaily
maybe
i
do
know
now
tell
would
you
like
to
know
asked
grisha
with
a
smile
it
was
a
tranquil
smile
egorka
was
about
to
stick
his
tongue
out
in
response
but
changed
his
mind
for
some
reason
they
began
to
converse
to
exchange
whispers
everything
around
them
lapsed
into
deep
quiet
and
nothing
appeared
to
give
heed
to
them
it
was
as
if
the
two
little
ones
went
off
into
quite
another
world
behind
a
thin
curtain
which
no
one
could
rend
so
motionless
stood
the
birches
bewitched
mysteriously
by
three
fallen
spirits
grisha
asked
again
yes
you
would
like
to
know
honest
to
god
i
d
like
to
here
s
a
cross
to
prove
it
said
egorka
rather
quickly
and
he
crossed
himself
with
an
oblique
movement
of
the
joined
fingers
of
his
dirty
hand
then
follow
me
said
grisha
he
turned
lightly
homewards
and
as
he
walked
he
did
not
stop
to
look
round
at
the
meagre
tiresome
objects
of
this
grey
life
egorka
followed
the
white
boy
he
walked
quietly
and
marvelled
at
the
other
he
thought
for
a
while
then
he
asked
are
you
not
one
of
god
s
angels
why
are
you
so
white
the
quiet
boy
smiled
at
these
words
he
said
with
a
light
sigh
no
i
am
a
human
you
don
t
mean
it
an
ordinary
boy
just
like
you
almost
like
how
clean
you
are
i
should
say
you
washed
yourself
seven
times
a
day
with
you
walk
about
barefoot
not
at
all
like
me
and
the
sunburn
doesn
t
seem
to
stick
to
you
there
s
only
a
cover
of
dust
on
your
the
aroma
of
violets
came
from
somewhere
and
it
mingled
now
with
the
dry
smell
of
the
flying
dust
now
with
the
sickly
odour
of
the
smoke
of
a
forest
fire
the
two
boys
avoided
the
tiresome
monotony
of
the
fields
and
the
roads
and
entered
the
dark
silence
of
the
wood
they
passed
by
glades
and
copses
and
quietly
purling
streams
the
boys
strode
along
narrow
footpaths
where
the
gentle
dew
clung
to
their
feet
everything
appeared
wonderful
in
egorka
s
eyes
used
only
to
the
raging
turbulence
of
a
malignant
yet
dull
and
grey
life
the
time
lingered
on
running
and
consuming
itself
wreathed
in
a
circle
of
delicious
moments
and
it
seemed
to
egorka
that
he
had
come
into
some
fabulous
land
he
slept
somewhere
at
night
and
he
felt
intensely
happy
on
opening
his
eyes
next
morning
having
been
awakened
by
the
twitter
of
birds
which
shook
the
dew
from
the
pliant
then
he
played
with
the
cheerful
boys
and
listened
to
music
sometimes
the
white
grisha
left
egorka
all
by
himself
then
he
again
reappeared
egorka
noticed
that
grisha
kept
apart
from
the
others
the
cheerful
noisy
children
that
he
did
not
play
with
them
and
that
he
spoke
little
not
that
he
was
afraid
or
deliberately
turned
aside
but
simply
because
it
seemed
to
arrange
itself
and
it
was
natural
for
him
to
be
alone
radiant
and
sad
once
egorka
and
grisha
on
being
left
by
themselves
went
strolling
together
through
a
little
wood
which
was
all
permeated
with
light
the
wood
grew
denser
and
denser
they
came
to
two
tall
straight
trees
a
bronze
rod
was
suspended
between
them
and
upon
the
rod
on
rings
hung
a
dark
red
silk
curtain
the
light
breeze
caused
the
thin
draperies
to
flutter
the
quiet
grisha
drew
the
curtain
aside
the
red
folds
came
together
with
a
sharp
rustle
and
with
a
sudden
flare
as
of
a
flame
the
opening
revealed
a
wooded
vista
all
permeated
with
a
strangely
bright
light
like
a
vision
of
a
transfigured
land
grisha
said
go
egorushka
it
is
good
egorka
looked
into
the
clear
wooded
distance
fear
beset
his
heart
and
he
said
quietly
i
am
what
are
you
afraid
of
silly
boy
asked
grisha
affectionately
i
don
t
know
something
makes
me
afraid
said
egorka
timidly
grisha
felt
aggrieved
he
sighed
quietly
and
then
said
well
go
home
then
if
you
are
afraid
egorka
recalled
his
home
his
mother
the
town
he
lived
in
he
did
not
have
a
very
happy
time
of
it
at
home
they
lived
poorly
and
he
was
whipped
often
egorka
suddenly
threw
himself
at
the
quiet
grisha
caught
him
by
his
gentle
cool
hands
and
cried
don
t
chase
me
away
dear
grisha
don
t
chase
me
from
am
i
chasing
you
away
retorted
grisha
you
yourself
don
t
want
to
egorka
got
down
on
his
knees
and
whispered
as
he
kissed
grisha
s
feet
i
pray
to
you
angels
with
all
my
then
follow
me
said
grisha
light
hands
descended
on
egorka
s
shoulders
and
lifted
him
from
the
grass
egorka
followed
grisha
obediently
to
the
blue
paradise
of
his
quiet
eyes
a
peaceful
valley
opened
before
him
and
the
quiet
children
played
in
it
the
dew
fell
on
egorka
s
feet
and
its
kisses
gave
him
joy
the
quiet
children
surrounded
egorka
and
grisha
and
all
joining
hands
in
one
broad
ring
carried
the
two
boys
with
them
in
a
swiftly
moving
dance
my
dear
angels
shouted
egorka
twirling
and
rejoicing
you
have
bright
little
faces
you
have
clean
little
eyes
you
have
white
little
hands
you
have
light
little
feet
am
i
on
earth
or
am
i
in
paradise
my
dear
ones
my
little
brothers
and
little
sisters
where
are
your
little
wings
some
one
s
near
voice
answered
him
you
are
upon
the
earth
not
in
paradise
and
we
have
no
need
of
wings
we
fly
they
captivated
bewitched
and
caressed
him
they
showed
him
all
the
wonders
of
the
wood
under
the
the
bushes
the
dry
leaves
little
with
rustling
little
voices
with
hair
straight
ones
and
hunchbacked
ones
little
old
men
of
the
wood
the
and
little
companion
spirits
bantering
little
sprites
in
green
coats
midnight
ones
and
daylight
ones
grey
ones
and
black
ones
little
with
shaggy
little
paws
fabulous
birds
and
animals
everything
that
is
not
to
be
seen
in
the
gloomy
everyday
earthly
world
egorka
had
a
splendid
time
with
the
quiet
children
he
did
not
notice
how
a
whole
week
had
passed
by
from
friday
to
friday
and
suddenly
he
began
to
long
for
his
mother
he
heard
her
calling
him
at
night
and
as
he
woke
in
agitation
he
called
mamma
where
are
you
there
was
stillness
and
silence
all
around
him
it
was
an
altogether
unknown
world
egorka
began
to
cry
the
quiet
children
came
to
comfort
him
they
said
to
him
there
s
nothing
to
cry
about
you
will
return
to
your
mother
and
she
will
be
glad
and
she
will
caress
she
may
whip
me
said
egorka
sobbing
the
quiet
children
smiled
and
said
fathers
and
mothers
whip
their
they
like
to
do
it
seems
wicked
to
beat
any
but
they
really
mean
they
beat
whom
they
people
mix
everything
up
shame
love
don
t
you
be
afraid
egorushka
she
s
a
very
well
i
ll
not
be
afraid
said
egorka
comforted
when
egorka
took
leave
of
the
quiet
children
grisha
said
to
him
you
had
better
not
tell
your
mother
where
you
have
passed
all
this
no
i
won
t
tell
replied
egorka
vigorously
not
for
you
ll
blab
it
out
said
one
of
the
girls
she
had
dark
infinitely
deep
eyes
her
thin
bare
arms
were
always
folded
obstinately
across
her
breast
she
spoke
even
less
than
the
other
quiet
children
and
of
all
human
words
she
liked
no
most
no
i
shan
t
blab
anything
asserted
egorka
i
shan
t
even
tell
any
one
where
i
have
been
i
shall
put
all
these
words
under
lock
and
that
same
evening
when
egorka
left
with
grisha
his
mother
suddenly
missed
him
she
shouted
a
long
time
and
cursed
and
threatened
but
as
there
was
no
response
she
became
frightened
perhaps
he
s
been
drowned
she
thought
she
ran
among
her
neighbours
wailing
and
lamenting
my
boy
s
gone
i
can
t
find
him
anywhere
i
simply
don
t
know
where
else
to
look
he
s
either
drowned
in
the
river
or
fallen
into
a
well
that
s
what
comes
of
one
neighbour
suggested
it
s
most
likely
the
jews
have
caught
him
and
are
keeping
him
in
some
spot
and
only
waiting
to
let
his
christian
blood
and
then
drink
this
guess
pleased
them
they
said
with
great
assurance
it
s
jews
they
are
again
at
it
that
accursed
there
s
no
getting
rid
of
what
a
wretched
affair
they
all
believed
this
the
disturbing
rumour
that
the
jews
had
stolen
a
christian
boy
spread
about
town
ostrov
took
a
most
zealous
share
in
disseminating
the
rumour
the
markets
were
filled
with
noisy
discussions
the
tradesmen
and
dealers
instigated
by
ostrov
bellowed
loudly
their
denunciations
why
did
ostrov
do
this
he
knew
of
course
that
it
was
a
lie
but
latterly
acting
on
the
instructions
of
the
local
branch
of
the
black
hundred
he
had
been
engaged
in
provocatory
work
the
new
episode
came
in
handily
the
police
began
an
investigation
they
looked
for
the
boy
but
without
success
in
any
case
they
found
a
jew
who
had
been
seen
by
some
one
near
egorka
s
house
he
was
arrested
it
was
evening
again
egorka
s
mother
was
at
home
when
egorka
returned
there
was
a
radiant
sadness
about
him
as
he
walked
up
to
his
mother
kissed
her
and
said
hello
mamma
egorka
s
mother
assailed
him
with
questions
oh
you
little
wretch
where
have
you
been
what
have
you
been
doing
what
unclean
demons
have
carried
you
away
egorka
remembered
his
promise
he
stood
before
his
mother
in
obstinate
silence
his
mother
questioned
him
angrily
where
have
you
been
tell
me
did
the
jews
try
to
crucify
you
what
jews
exclaimed
egorka
no
one
has
tried
to
crucify
you
just
wait
you
young
brat
shouted
his
mother
in
a
rage
i
ll
make
you
she
caught
hold
of
the
besom
and
began
to
tear
off
its
twigs
then
she
stripped
the
boy
of
his
light
clothes
still
wrapt
in
his
radiant
sadness
egorka
looked
at
his
mother
with
astonished
eyes
he
cried
plaintively
mamma
what
are
you
doing
but
already
seized
by
the
rough
hand
the
little
body
that
had
been
washed
by
the
still
waters
began
to
struggle
on
the
knees
of
the
harshly
crying
woman
it
was
painful
and
egorka
sobbed
in
a
shrill
voice
his
mother
beat
him
long
and
painfully
and
she
accompanied
each
blow
with
an
admonition
tell
me
where
you
ve
been
tell
me
i
won
t
stop
until
you
tell
at
last
she
stopped
and
burst
out
into
violent
crying
why
has
god
punished
me
so
but
no
i
ll
yet
beat
a
word
out
of
you
i
ll
give
it
to
you
worse
egorka
was
shaken
less
by
the
physical
pain
than
by
the
unexpected
harshness
of
his
reception
he
had
been
in
touch
with
another
world
and
the
quiet
children
in
the
enchanted
valley
had
reconstructed
his
soul
on
another
plane
his
mother
however
loved
him
of
course
she
loved
him
that
was
why
she
beat
him
in
her
anger
love
and
cruelty
go
always
together
among
humankind
they
like
to
torment
vengeance
gives
them
pleasure
but
later
egorka
s
mother
took
pity
on
him
she
thought
she
had
flogged
him
too
hard
and
now
she
walked
up
quietly
to
him
egorka
lay
on
the
bench
and
moaned
softly
then
he
grew
silent
his
mother
smoothed
his
back
awkwardly
with
her
rough
hands
and
left
him
she
thought
he
had
gone
to
sleep
in
the
morning
she
went
to
wake
him
she
found
him
lying
cold
and
motionless
on
the
bench
his
face
downward
and
his
radiance
was
gone
from
him
he
lay
there
a
dark
cold
corpse
the
horrified
mother
began
to
wail
he
s
dead
egorushka
are
you
really
dead
oh
god
and
his
little
hands
are
quite
cold
she
dashed
out
to
her
neighbours
she
aroused
the
whole
neighbourhood
with
her
shrill
cries
inquisitive
women
soon
filled
the
house
i
struck
him
ever
so
lightly
with
a
thin
twig
the
mother
wailed
then
my
angel
lay
down
on
the
bench
cried
a
little
then
grew
quiet
and
went
to
sleep
and
in
the
morning
he
gave
up
his
soul
to
held
by
a
heavy
sleep
egorka
lay
there
motionless
and
to
all
appearances
lifeless
and
listened
to
his
mother
s
wailing
and
to
the
discordant
clamour
of
voices
and
he
heard
his
mother
keening
over
him
those
accursed
jews
have
sucked
out
all
his
blood
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
i
beat
my
little
darling
it
used
to
be
that
i
d
beat
him
and
put
a
bit
of
salt
on
afterwards
and
nothing
would
come
of
it
and
here
i
ve
hit
him
with
a
little
twig
and
he
my
handsome
darling
my
little
angel
egorka
heard
her
groans
and
wondered
at
his
fettered
helplessness
and
immobility
he
seemed
to
hear
the
noise
of
some
one
else
s
body
he
realized
that
it
was
his
own
as
it
was
put
on
the
floor
to
be
washed
he
had
an
intense
longing
to
stir
to
rise
but
he
could
not
he
thought
i
have
died
what
are
they
going
to
do
with
me
now
and
again
he
thought
why
is
it
that
my
soul
is
not
leaving
my
body
i
do
not
feel
that
i
have
arms
or
legs
yet
i
can
he
wondered
and
waited
then
with
a
sudden
powerless
exertion
he
tried
to
wake
from
his
sleep
to
return
to
himself
to
run
away
from
the
dark
grave
and
again
his
helpless
will
drooped
and
again
he
waited
and
he
heard
the
sounds
of
the
funeral
chant
and
noted
the
blueness
of
the
little
cloud
of
and
the
fragrance
that
was
wafted
by
the
quietly
sounding
swings
of
the
smoky
censer
chapter
xxvi
egorka
was
buried
his
mother
wept
long
over
his
grave
in
wails
then
went
home
she
was
convinced
that
her
boy
would
be
far
better
off
there
than
upon
the
earth
and
was
consoled
but
such
truly
russian
people
as
kerbakh
ostrov
and
others
would
not
be
consoled
they
let
loose
evil
rumours
the
report
spread
the
jews
have
tortured
a
christian
boy
they
ve
cut
him
up
with
knives
and
used
his
blood
in
their
the
slanderers
were
not
deterred
by
the
consideration
that
the
jewish
passover
had
taken
place
very
much
earlier
than
the
running
away
of
egorka
from
his
mother
the
townsmen
were
agitated
those
who
believed
as
well
as
those
who
did
not
believe
the
tale
demands
were
made
for
an
investigation
and
the
opening
of
the
grave
elisaveta
came
to
trirodov
s
house
early
in
the
day
and
remained
there
long
trirodov
showed
her
his
colony
the
quiet
boy
grisha
accompanied
them
and
looked
with
the
blue
reposefulness
of
his
impassionate
eyes
into
the
blue
flames
of
her
rapturous
ones
soothing
the
sultriness
and
passion
of
her
agitation
her
light
ample
dress
seemed
transparent
the
perfect
outlines
of
her
body
showed
clearly
the
red
and
white
roses
of
her
breast
and
shoulders
were
visible
her
sunburnt
feet
were
bare
she
loved
the
affectionate
contact
of
the
earth
and
the
grass
it
was
all
like
a
paradise
the
twittering
of
the
birds
the
hubbub
of
the
children
the
rustle
of
the
wind
in
the
grass
and
in
the
trees
the
murmur
of
the
brook
in
the
wood
everything
was
innocent
as
in
paradise
girls
scantily
dressed
came
up
spoke
to
them
and
were
not
ashamed
everything
was
chaste
as
in
paradise
and
cloudless
the
sky
shone
above
the
forest
glades
towards
evening
elisaveta
sat
at
trirodov
s
they
read
poems
elisaveta
loved
poems
even
before
she
met
trirodov
who
else
should
love
them
if
not
girls
now
she
read
poems
avidly
whole
hours
passed
by
quickly
in
reading
and
the
poems
gave
birth
in
her
to
sweet
and
bitter
emotions
and
passionate
dreams
perhaps
this
was
so
because
she
was
in
love
in
love
she
had
found
a
new
sun
for
herself
and
she
led
a
new
dance
round
it
of
dreams
hopes
sorrows
joys
enchantments
and
raptures
and
flaunting
a
rainbow
of
radiance
this
round
dance
this
naming
circle
of
impetuous
emotions
was
full
of
a
rich
music
and
vivid
colour
trirodov
caused
her
to
fall
in
love
with
the
verses
of
the
new
poets
she
found
such
enchantments
and
such
disillusions
in
the
fragile
music
of
new
poetry
written
so
happily
and
so
elusively
with
a
lightness
and
transparency
like
those
of
the
dresses
that
she
now
loved
to
wear
with
the
harmony
of
their
souls
thus
achieved
why
should
they
not
love
one
another
once
after
they
had
read
together
some
beautiful
trirodov
remarked
love
says
no
to
the
world
the
lyrical
no
marriage
says
yes
to
it
the
ironic
to
be
in
love
to
strive
yet
not
to
possess
that
is
the
poetry
of
love
sweet
but
illusive
externally
love
contradicts
the
world
and
conceals
its
fatal
discord
to
be
together
to
say
yes
to
some
one
to
yield
oneself
that
is
the
way
in
which
life
reveals
its
irreconcilable
contradictions
and
how
to
be
together
when
we
are
such
solitary
souls
and
how
to
yield
oneself
mask
after
mask
falls
off
and
it
is
terrible
to
see
actuality
a
weariness
comes
on
what
has
become
of
love
that
love
which
had
prided
itself
on
being
stronger
than
death
you
have
had
a
wife
said
elisaveta
you
loved
her
everything
here
is
reminiscent
of
her
she
was
her
voice
became
dark
and
the
blue
flashes
under
the
moist
eyelids
lit
up
with
a
jealous
flame
trirodov
smiled
and
said
sadly
she
left
life
before
the
time
had
come
for
weariness
to
make
its
appearance
my
dulcinea
did
not
want
to
become
dulcinea
is
loved
said
elisaveta
but
the
fullness
of
life
belongs
to
aldonza
becoming
but
does
aldonza
want
that
asked
trirodov
she
wants
it
but
can
not
realize
it
said
elisaveta
but
we
will
help
her
we
will
teach
trirodov
smiled
affectionately
if
sadly
and
said
but
he
like
the
eternal
don
juan
always
seeks
dulcinea
and
what
is
to
him
the
poor
earthly
aldonza
poisoned
by
the
dream
of
beauty
it
is
for
that
that
he
will
love
her
replied
elisaveta
because
she
is
poor
and
has
been
poisoned
by
the
exultant
dream
of
beauty
the
basis
for
their
union
will
be
creative
the
night
came
a
darkness
settled
outside
the
windows
full
of
the
whisperings
of
sad
pellucid
voices
trirodov
walked
up
to
the
window
elisaveta
soon
stood
beside
him
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
their
eyes
fixed
themselves
upon
the
distant
dimly
visible
cemetery
trirodov
said
quietly
he
has
been
buried
there
but
he
will
rise
from
his
elisaveta
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
and
asked
who
trirodov
glanced
at
her
like
one
suddenly
awakened
and
said
slowly
it
is
a
boy
who
has
not
yet
lived
and
who
is
still
chaste
his
body
contains
all
possibilities
and
not
a
single
achievement
he
is
like
one
created
to
receive
every
energy
directed
at
him
now
he
is
asleep
in
his
tight
coffin
in
a
grave
he
will
awake
for
a
life
free
from
passions
and
desires
for
clear
seeing
and
hearing
for
the
establishment
of
one
when
will
he
awake
asked
elisaveta
when
i
wish
it
said
trirodov
i
will
wake
the
sound
of
his
voice
was
sad
and
insistent
like
the
sound
of
an
invocation
asked
elisaveta
if
you
wish
it
answered
trirodov
quietly
must
i
leave
she
asked
again
yes
he
answered
just
as
simply
and
as
quietly
as
before
she
bid
him
and
left
trirodov
again
walked
up
to
the
window
he
called
some
one
in
a
voice
of
invocation
and
whispered
you
will
awake
dear
one
wake
rise
come
to
me
i
will
open
your
eyes
and
you
will
see
what
you
have
not
yet
seen
i
will
open
your
ears
and
you
will
hear
what
you
have
not
yet
heard
you
are
of
the
earth
i
will
not
part
you
from
the
earth
you
are
from
me
you
are
mine
you
are
i
come
to
me
wake
he
waited
confidently
he
knew
that
when
the
sleeper
had
awakened
in
his
grave
they
would
come
to
him
the
wise
innocent
ones
and
would
tell
him
kirsha
walked
into
the
room
quietly
he
walked
up
to
his
father
and
asked
are
you
looking
at
the
cemetery
trirodov
laid
his
hand
silently
on
the
boy
s
head
kirsha
said
there
is
a
boy
in
one
of
the
graves
who
is
not
how
do
you
know
asked
trirodov
but
he
knew
what
kirsha
s
answer
would
be
kirsha
said
grisha
told
me
that
egorka
was
not
quite
dead
he
is
asleep
but
he
will
awake
yes
said
trirodov
and
will
he
come
to
you
asked
kirsha
yes
was
the
answer
when
will
he
come
asked
kirsha
again
trirodov
said
with
a
smile
rouse
grisha
and
ask
him
whether
the
sleeper
has
yet
begun
to
wake
in
his
kirsha
walked
away
trirodov
looked
in
silence
at
the
distant
cemetery
where
the
dark
bereaved
night
stooped
sadly
over
the
crosses
and
where
are
you
my
happy
beloved
a
quiet
rustle
made
itself
audible
behind
the
doors
the
little
moved
quietly
near
the
walls
and
whispered
and
waited
awakened
by
a
low
sigh
grisha
arose
he
walked
out
into
the
garden
and
stood
listening
with
downcast
eyes
near
the
railing
he
was
smiling
but
without
joy
who
knew
whether
the
other
would
rejoice
kirsha
walked
up
to
him
and
indicating
the
cemetery
with
a
movement
of
his
head
asked
is
he
alive
has
he
awakened
yes
said
grisha
egorushka
is
sighing
in
his
grave
he
s
just
kirsha
ran
home
to
his
father
and
repeated
to
him
grisha
s
words
we
must
make
haste
said
trirodov
he
again
experienced
an
agitation
with
which
he
had
been
long
familiar
he
felt
in
himself
an
ebb
and
flow
as
of
some
strange
power
a
kind
of
marvellous
energy
gathered
by
some
means
known
to
himself
alone
issued
slowly
from
him
a
mysterious
current
passed
between
himself
and
the
grave
where
the
boy
who
had
departed
from
life
lay
in
the
throes
of
it
cast
a
spell
upon
the
sleeper
and
caused
him
to
stir
trirodov
quickly
descended
the
stairway
into
the
room
where
the
quiet
children
slept
his
light
footsteps
were
barely
audible
and
his
feet
felt
the
cold
that
came
from
the
planked
floor
the
quiet
children
lay
upon
their
beds
motionlessly
as
if
they
did
not
breathe
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
many
of
them
and
that
they
slept
eternally
in
the
endless
darkness
of
that
quiet
bedchamber
trirodov
paused
seven
times
and
each
time
one
of
the
sleepers
awoke
at
his
one
glance
three
boys
and
four
girls
answered
his
call
they
stood
there
tranquilly
looked
at
trirodov
and
waited
follow
me
said
trirodov
they
walked
after
him
the
white
quiet
ones
and
the
rustle
of
their
light
footsteps
was
barely
heard
kirsha
waited
in
the
garden
and
he
seemed
earthly
and
dark
among
the
white
quiet
children
they
walked
quickly
upon
the
navii
path
like
gliding
nocturnal
shadows
one
after
another
the
whole
ten
of
them
with
grisha
leading
the
dew
fell
upon
their
naked
feet
and
the
ground
under
their
feet
was
soft
warm
and
sad
egorka
awoke
in
his
grave
it
was
dark
and
somewhat
stuffy
his
head
felt
oppressed
as
under
a
weight
there
sounded
in
his
ears
the
persistent
call
rise
come
to
fear
assailed
him
his
eyes
looked
but
did
not
see
it
was
hard
to
breathe
he
recalled
something
and
all
that
he
recalled
was
like
a
horrible
delirium
then
came
the
sudden
awful
realization
i
am
in
a
grave
in
a
he
groaned
and
his
heart
began
to
thump
his
throat
as
if
clutched
by
some
one
s
fingers
shivered
convulsively
his
eyes
dilated
widely
and
the
flaming
darkness
of
the
coffin
swept
before
them
as
he
tossed
about
in
the
tight
coffin
tormented
by
his
dread
egorka
moaned
and
whispered
in
a
dull
voice
three
three
three
fallen
sprites
the
gate
to
the
was
open
trirodov
and
the
children
entered
they
were
among
the
poor
graves
simple
little
mounds
and
wooden
crosses
it
was
gloomy
damp
and
quiet
there
was
a
smell
of
grass
a
graveyard
reverie
the
crosses
gleamed
white
in
the
mist
a
poignant
silence
hovered
there
and
the
whole
cemetery
seemed
filled
with
the
dark
reverie
of
the
dead
poignant
feelings
were
deliciously
and
painfully
nowhere
does
the
soil
feel
so
near
to
one
as
in
a
graveyard
it
is
the
sacred
soil
of
repose
they
walked
quietly
the
whole
ten
of
them
one
after
another
and
felt
the
coolness
and
the
softness
of
the
ground
under
their
bare
feet
they
passed
near
a
grave
the
little
mound
was
quiet
and
poor
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
earth
were
crying
wailing
and
suffering
the
boys
dimly
discernible
in
the
darkness
against
the
lumps
of
black
earth
began
to
dig
the
grave
the
little
girls
stood
very
quietly
one
at
each
of
the
four
sides
and
seemed
engrossed
in
the
nocturnal
silence
the
watchmen
slept
like
the
dead
and
the
dead
slept
keeping
a
powerless
watch
over
their
graves
slowly
the
little
coffin
began
to
show
the
low
moan
became
audible
the
boys
already
jumped
into
the
grave
they
bent
over
the
poor
little
coffin
though
it
was
with
earth
the
boys
already
felt
the
tremors
of
its
cover
under
their
feet
the
cover
hammered
down
with
nails
yielded
easily
to
the
exertions
of
the
small
childish
hands
and
fell
to
the
side
against
the
grave
s
earthen
wall
the
coffin
opened
as
simply
as
the
door
of
a
room
opens
egorka
was
already
losing
his
consciousness
when
the
boys
first
looked
at
him
he
was
lying
on
his
side
he
stirred
faintly
he
breathed
in
the
air
as
if
with
short
broken
sighs
he
shivered
he
turned
over
on
his
back
the
fresh
air
blew
into
his
face
like
a
young
rapture
of
deliverance
there
was
a
sudden
instant
of
joy
and
it
went
out
like
a
flame
why
indeed
should
he
rejoice
the
tranquil
unjoyous
ones
bent
over
him
again
to
live
his
soul
felt
strange
quiet
indifferent
some
one
said
affectionately
over
him
rise
dear
one
come
to
us
we
will
show
you
that
which
you
have
not
seen
and
will
teach
you
that
which
is
the
stars
of
the
far
sky
looked
into
his
eyes
and
some
one
s
near
affectionate
eyes
bent
over
him
many
many
gentle
cool
hands
stretched
out
to
him
they
took
him
helped
him
up
and
lifted
him
out
he
stood
in
a
circle
they
looked
at
him
his
arms
again
folded
themselves
across
his
breast
as
in
the
grave
as
if
the
habit
had
been
assimilated
for
ages
one
of
the
little
girls
rearranged
them
and
straightened
them
out
suddenly
egorka
asked
what
is
this
a
little
grave
grisha
replied
this
is
your
grave
but
you
will
be
with
us
and
with
our
and
the
grave
asked
egorka
we
will
fill
it
up
again
replied
grisha
the
boys
began
to
fill
up
the
grave
egorka
looked
on
in
quiet
astonishment
as
lumps
of
earth
fell
into
the
grave
and
the
little
mound
kept
on
growing
the
ground
was
smoothed
down
and
the
cross
placed
as
before
egorka
walked
up
to
it
and
read
the
inscription
boy
giorgiy
then
the
year
month
and
date
of
his
death
he
was
faintly
astonished
but
an
ominous
indifference
already
made
captive
his
soul
some
one
touched
his
shoulder
and
asked
something
egorka
was
silent
he
looked
as
if
he
did
not
understand
come
to
me
said
trirodov
quietly
to
him
the
little
girl
who
always
said
no
took
egorka
by
the
hand
and
led
him
away
they
went
back
by
the
same
road
as
they
came
the
darkness
closed
after
them
egorka
remained
with
the
quiet
children
he
had
no
passport
and
his
life
was
different
chapter
xxvii
trirodov
returned
home
like
one
returned
from
a
grave
he
felt
happy
and
his
heart
was
consumed
with
exultation
and
resolution
he
recalled
the
talk
he
had
had
that
day
with
elisaveta
there
rose
before
him
the
proud
joyous
vision
of
life
transfigured
by
the
force
of
creative
art
of
life
created
by
the
proud
will
if
love
or
what
seemed
like
love
came
to
him
why
should
he
resist
it
whether
it
was
a
true
emotion
or
an
illusion
was
it
not
all
the
same
the
will
exulting
above
the
world
would
determine
everything
as
it
wanted
it
would
have
the
power
to
erect
a
beautiful
love
over
the
helplessness
of
the
exhausted
senses
that
which
has
so
long
weighed
in
the
scales
of
consciousness
that
which
has
so
long
and
so
desperately
wrestled
in
the
dark
region
of
the
unconscious
now
stood
at
a
clear
decision
let
the
word
yes
he
said
once
more
yes
for
a
new
grief
for
a
glorious
triumph
it
was
all
the
same
if
only
he
believed
in
her
and
she
in
him
so
much
did
one
mean
to
the
other
now
trirodov
sat
down
at
the
table
he
smiled
and
for
a
few
moments
seemed
lost
in
thought
then
he
wrote
quickly
upon
a
light
blue
sheet
of
paper
elisaveta
i
want
your
love
love
me
dear
one
love
me
i
forget
my
knowledge
i
reject
my
doubts
i
become
again
as
simple
and
as
humble
as
a
communicant
of
a
radiant
kingdom
like
my
dear
children
and
i
only
want
your
nearness
and
your
kisses
upon
the
earth
dear
to
our
heart
i
will
pass
by
in
simple
and
joyous
humility
with
bare
feet
like
you
in
order
that
i
may
come
to
you
as
you
come
to
me
love
me
your
there
was
a
slight
rustle
behind
the
door
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
house
were
filled
with
the
quiet
children
trirodov
sealed
the
letter
he
wished
to
take
it
at
once
and
leave
it
on
the
sill
of
her
open
window
he
walked
quietly
immersed
in
the
wood
s
darkness
and
his
feet
felt
the
contact
of
warm
moss
the
grass
and
the
simple
rough
beloved
earth
a
refreshing
breeze
blew
from
the
river
in
the
night
coolness
but
now
and
then
there
came
a
sickly
pungent
gust
of
the
forest
fire
elisaveta
could
not
fall
asleep
she
rose
from
her
bed
she
stood
by
the
window
and
yielded
her
naked
body
to
the
transparent
embraces
of
the
nocturnal
breeze
she
thought
of
something
mused
of
something
and
all
her
thoughts
and
musings
joined
in
one
dancing
circle
around
trirodov
should
she
wait
he
was
a
weary
sad
man
and
he
would
not
say
the
sweet
words
for
fear
of
appearing
ridiculous
and
of
receiving
a
cold
answer
why
should
i
wait
she
thought
or
don
t
i
dare
decide
my
fate
like
a
queen
to
call
him
to
me
and
to
demand
his
love
why
should
i
remain
silent
and
she
decided
i
will
tell
him
myself
i
love
you
i
love
you
come
to
me
love
elisaveta
whispered
the
delicious
words
entrusting
her
passionate
reveries
to
the
nocturnal
silence
the
dark
eyes
of
the
nocturnal
guest
who
brought
tempting
reveries
were
aflame
the
quiet
splashing
laughter
of
the
behind
the
reeds
under
the
moon
mingled
with
the
quiet
delicious
laughter
of
the
nocturnal
enchantress
who
had
flaming
eyes
burning
lips
and
a
naked
body
formed
from
the
coils
of
white
flame
her
flaming
body
was
like
elisaveta
s
body
and
the
black
lightnings
of
the
invisible
sorceress
were
like
the
blue
lightnings
of
elisaveta
s
eyes
she
tempted
elisaveta
and
called
to
her
go
to
him
go
fall
naked
at
his
feet
kiss
his
feet
laugh
for
him
dance
for
him
tire
yourself
out
for
his
sake
be
a
slave
to
him
be
a
thing
in
his
hands
cling
to
him
and
kiss
him
and
look
into
his
eyes
and
yield
yourself
up
to
him
go
go
hurry
run
he
is
approaching
even
now
do
you
see
him
it
is
he
who
has
just
come
out
of
the
wood
do
you
see
it
is
his
feet
that
show
white
in
the
grass
fling
the
door
wide
open
and
run
as
you
are
to
meet
elisaveta
saw
trirodov
coming
her
heart
began
to
beat
with
such
pain
and
such
delight
she
walked
away
from
the
window
she
waited
she
heard
his
footsteps
on
the
sand
under
the
window
something
flashed
through
the
window
and
fell
on
the
floor
the
footsteps
retreated
elisaveta
picked
up
the
letter
lit
a
candle
and
read
the
beloved
blue
sheet
of
paper
the
nocturnal
enchantress
whispered
to
her
he
s
going
away
hurry
you
will
know
how
sweet
are
the
first
kisses
of
love
go
to
him
run
after
him
don
t
look
for
tiresome
elisaveta
impetuously
flung
the
door
open
on
the
veranda
and
ran
down
the
broad
steps
into
the
garden
she
ran
after
trirodov
and
shouted
giorgiy
it
was
like
the
outcry
of
passionate
desire
trirodov
paused
saw
her
impetuously
white
and
clear
in
the
moonlight
elisaveta
fell
into
his
arms
and
kissed
him
and
laughed
and
kept
on
repeating
without
end
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
and
they
kissed
and
they
laughed
and
said
something
to
one
another
the
red
and
white
roses
of
her
strong
graceful
body
were
chaste
and
uncrumpled
the
words
they
said
to
one
another
were
chaste
and
sacred
the
chaste
moon
looked
down
on
them
and
the
stars
also
as
they
spoke
the
words
that
bound
them
to
one
another
there
were
vows
and
rites
not
less
durable
than
any
other
kind
there
were
smiles
kisses
tender
words
in
these
consist
the
eternal
rite
and
the
eternal
mystery
the
sky
began
to
lighten
and
a
new
dew
fell
on
a
new
dawn
and
when
the
sunrise
had
extended
its
rapturous
flames
the
sun
rose
only
then
they
parted
elisaveta
returned
to
her
room
but
she
could
not
sleep
she
went
into
elena
s
room
elena
had
only
just
awakened
elisaveta
lay
down
at
her
side
under
the
and
told
her
about
her
great
love
her
great
joy
elena
rejoiced
and
laughed
and
kissed
her
sister
without
end
then
elisaveta
put
on
her
morning
dress
and
went
to
her
father
to
tell
him
about
her
joy
her
happiness
as
for
trirodov
oppressed
by
morning
fatigue
he
walked
home
across
the
moist
grass
and
his
soul
was
filled
with
perplexity
and
dread
later
in
the
day
he
drove
to
the
rameyevs
he
brought
as
a
gift
to
elisaveta
a
photograph
he
had
taken
of
his
first
wife
upon
her
nude
body
was
a
bronze
belt
its
ends
coming
down
to
the
knees
being
joined
up
in
the
front
upon
her
dark
hair
was
a
narrow
round
strip
of
gold
a
slender
graceful
body
a
melancholy
smile
intense
dark
eyes
father
knows
said
elisaveta
father
is
glad
let
us
go
to
when
elisaveta
and
trirodov
were
once
more
alone
a
dark
thought
came
into
elisaveta
s
mind
she
became
pensively
sad
and
asked
what
of
the
sleeper
in
the
grave
he
has
awakened
replied
trirodov
he
s
in
my
house
we
ve
dug
up
his
grave
just
in
time
to
save
his
mother
from
having
any
qualms
of
what
do
you
mean
trirodov
explained
early
this
morning
the
coroner
had
the
grave
dug
up
they
found
the
empty
coffin
luckily
i
found
out
about
this
in
time
before
new
stupid
talk
might
arise
and
gave
them
the
necessary
what
of
the
boy
asked
elisaveta
he
will
remain
with
me
he
does
not
wish
to
go
to
his
mother
and
he
is
not
particularly
necessary
to
her
she
will
receive
money
for
trirodov
said
all
this
in
a
dry
cold
voice
the
news
that
elisaveta
would
become
trirodov
s
wife
acted
differently
on
her
relatives
rameyev
liked
trirodov
and
was
glad
because
of
the
closer
connexion
he
was
a
little
sorry
for
piotr
but
thought
it
was
well
that
the
matter
had
come
to
a
decision
and
piotr
would
no
longer
torment
himself
by
entertaining
false
hopes
nevertheless
rameyev
was
disturbed
for
some
unknown
reason
elena
loved
elisaveta
and
shared
her
joy
she
loved
piotr
and
was
therefore
even
more
glad
she
pitied
him
and
therefore
loved
him
even
more
she
loved
him
so
deeply
and
entertained
such
hopes
of
his
love
that
her
pity
for
him
became
serene
and
radiant
she
looked
at
piotr
with
loving
eyes
piotr
was
in
a
state
of
despair
but
elena
s
eyes
aroused
in
him
a
sweet
agitation
for
a
new
love
his
wearied
heart
thirsted
and
suffered
intensely
from
deceived
hopes
misha
was
strangely
distraught
he
flushed
and
ran
off
more
than
usual
with
his
to
the
river
there
he
wept
now
he
impetuously
embraced
elisaveta
now
trirodov
he
felt
ashamed
and
bitter
he
knew
that
elisaveta
did
not
even
suspect
his
love
and
that
she
looked
at
him
as
at
an
infant
sometimes
in
his
helplessness
he
hated
her
he
said
to
piotr
i
shouldn
t
walk
about
with
a
long
face
if
i
were
you
she
is
not
worthy
of
your
love
she
puts
on
airs
elena
is
much
better
elena
is
a
dear
while
the
other
fancies
all
sorts
of
piotr
walked
away
from
him
in
silence
and
it
was
well
that
there
was
some
one
who
did
not
scold
and
with
whom
it
was
possible
to
ease
his
soul
misha
too
wanted
to
be
with
elisaveta
and
it
made
him
feel
ashamed
and
depressed
miss
harrison
did
not
express
her
opinion
many
things
had
already
shocked
her
and
she
grew
accustomed
to
bear
herself
indifferently
to
everything
that
happened
here
trirodov
in
her
opinion
was
an
adventurer
a
man
with
a
doubtful
reputation
and
a
dark
past
elisaveta
was
the
most
tranquil
of
all
piotr
s
gloomy
appearance
disturbed
rameyev
he
wanted
to
comfort
him
if
only
with
words
luckily
people
believe
even
in
words
they
must
believe
in
something
rameyev
and
piotr
happened
to
find
themselves
alone
rameyev
said
i
must
confess
that
i
once
thought
elisaveta
loved
you
or
that
she
might
love
you
if
you
wished
it
piotr
said
with
a
gloomy
smile
i
too
may
be
pardoned
for
the
error
all
the
more
since
trirodov
does
not
lack
any
one
may
be
pardoned
for
mistakes
answered
rameyev
calmly
though
they
may
be
painful
enough
piotr
grumbled
something
rameyev
continued
i
have
been
observing
elisaveta
very
attentively
of
late
and
listen
to
what
i
say
pardon
me
for
my
frankness
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
d
be
better
off
with
elena
perhaps
you
have
also
erred
in
your
piotr
replied
with
a
bitter
smile
why
of
course
elena
is
more
simple
she
doesn
t
read
philosophic
books
she
doesn
t
wear
frocks
and
doesn
t
detest
any
why
drag
into
everything
asked
rameyev
elena
is
not
as
simple
as
you
think
she
is
a
very
intelligent
girl
though
without
pretensions
to
a
deep
and
broad
outlook
and
she
is
good
attractive
and
in
fact
quite
a
match
for
me
observed
piotr
with
an
ironic
smile
as
for
that
said
rameyev
you
are
not
limited
to
choosing
a
charming
wife
from
among
my
that
s
not
so
easy
said
piotr
with
dejected
irony
but
i
see
no
need
of
insisting
besides
the
same
thing
might
happen
with
elena
she
might
come
across
a
more
brilliant
match
and
there
are
not
a
few
charlatans
in
this
world
of
the
trirodov
elena
loves
you
said
rameyev
surely
you
have
noticed
it
piotr
laughed
he
assumed
a
gaiety
or
did
he
actually
feel
gay
and
joyous
at
the
sudden
thought
of
the
charming
elena
of
course
she
loved
him
but
he
asked
why
do
you
think
my
dear
uncle
that
i
need
a
wife
at
all
costs
may
god
be
with
her
you
are
in
love
generally
as
is
common
in
your
years
said
rameyev
perhaps
said
piotr
but
elisaveta
s
choice
revolts
why
should
it
asked
rameyev
for
many
reasons
replied
piotr
for
one
thing
he
presented
her
with
a
photograph
of
his
dead
wife
a
naked
beauty
why
is
it
right
to
make
universal
that
which
is
intimate
she
revealed
her
body
to
her
husband
and
not
for
elisaveta
and
for
you
would
do
away
with
many
fine
pictures
if
you
had
your
way
said
rameyev
i
am
not
so
simple
as
not
to
be
able
to
make
a
distinction
replied
piotr
animatedly
in
the
one
case
it
is
pure
art
always
sacred
in
the
other
there
is
an
effort
to
inflame
the
feelings
with
pornographic
pictures
and
don
t
you
notice
it
yourself
uncle
that
elisaveta
has
poisoned
herself
with
this
sweet
poison
and
has
become
terribly
passionate
and
insufficiently
modest
i
do
not
find
this
at
all
said
rameyev
dryly
she
is
in
love
so
what
s
to
be
done
if
there
is
sensuality
in
people
what
is
to
be
done
with
nature
shall
the
whole
world
be
maimed
in
order
to
gratify
a
decrepit
morality
uncle
i
did
not
suspect
you
of
being
such
an
amoralist
said
piotr
in
vexation
there
is
morality
and
morality
replied
rameyev
not
without
some
confusion
i
do
not
uphold
depravity
but
nevertheless
demand
freedom
of
thought
and
feeling
a
free
feeling
is
always
and
what
will
you
say
of
those
naked
girls
in
his
woods
is
that
also
innocent
asked
piotr
rather
spitefully
of
course
replied
rameyev
his
problem
is
to
lull
to
sleep
the
beast
in
man
and
to
awaken
the
i
have
heard
his
discourses
said
piotr
showing
his
annoyance
and
i
do
not
believe
them
in
the
slightest
i
m
only
astonished
that
others
can
believe
such
nonsense
and
i
don
t
believe
either
in
his
poetry
or
in
his
chemistry
he
has
too
many
secrets
and
mysteries
too
many
cunning
mechanisms
in
his
doors
and
his
corridors
then
there
are
his
quiet
children
that
i
do
not
understand
at
all
where
have
they
come
from
what
does
he
do
with
them
there
is
something
nasty
behind
it
that
s
a
work
of
the
imagination
answered
rameyev
we
see
him
often
we
can
always
go
to
him
and
we
haven
t
seen
or
heard
anything
in
his
house
or
in
his
colony
to
confirm
the
town
tattle
about
piotr
recalled
the
evening
that
he
met
trirodov
on
the
his
sad
but
determined
eyes
suddenly
flared
up
in
piotr
s
memory
and
the
poison
of
his
spite
grew
weaker
he
seemed
affected
as
by
a
strange
bewitchment
as
if
some
one
persistently
yet
quietly
urged
him
to
believe
that
the
ways
of
trirodov
were
fair
and
clean
piotr
closed
his
eyes
and
the
radiant
vision
appeared
before
him
of
the
girls
of
the
wood
who
filed
past
him
and
sanctified
him
by
the
serenity
and
the
peace
of
their
chaste
eyes
piotr
sighed
and
said
quietly
as
if
fatigued
i
have
no
cause
to
say
these
malicious
words
perhaps
you
are
right
but
it
is
so
hard
for
me
nevertheless
this
conversation
did
much
to
soothe
piotr
thoughts
about
elena
returned
to
him
oftener
and
oftener
and
became
more
and
more
tender
it
so
happened
that
acting
upon
some
unspoken
yet
understood
agreement
every
one
tried
to
direct
piotr
s
attention
to
elena
piotr
submitted
to
this
general
influence
and
was
affectionate
and
gentle
with
elena
elena
expectantly
waited
for
his
love
and
at
night
turning
her
blazing
face
and
loosened
locks
in
the
direction
of
the
nymph
s
laughter
she
would
whisper
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
and
when
left
alone
with
piotr
she
would
look
at
him
with
eyes
all
rosy
like
the
spring
and
pulsating
with
expectancy
and
with
every
sigh
of
her
tender
breast
and
with
all
the
life
of
her
passionate
body
she
would
repeat
the
same
unspoken
words
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
and
piotr
began
to
understand
that
he
had
met
his
fate
in
elena
and
that
whether
he
willed
it
or
not
he
would
grow
to
love
her
this
presentiment
of
a
new
love
was
like
a
sweet
gnawing
in
a
heart
wounded
by
treacherous
love
chapter
xxviii
the
local
police
department
was
not
very
skilful
in
tracking
down
thieves
and
murderers
and
it
did
not
occupy
itself
much
with
this
ungrateful
business
it
had
other
things
to
think
of
in
those
turbulent
days
instead
it
turned
its
attention
to
trirodov
s
educational
colony
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
ostrov
and
his
friends
and
patrons
the
neighbourhood
of
trirodov
s
estate
began
to
teem
with
detectives
they
assumed
various
guises
and
though
they
employed
all
their
cunning
to
escape
observation
they
did
not
succeed
in
fooling
any
one
of
limited
intelligence
they
fulfilled
their
duties
without
inspiration
tediously
greyly
and
dully
soon
the
children
learned
to
recognize
the
detectives
even
at
a
distance
they
would
say
at
the
sight
of
a
suspicious
character
there
goes
a
detective
upon
seeing
him
again
they
would
say
there
goes
our
detective
of
the
uniformed
police
the
first
to
make
inquiries
at
trirodov
s
colony
was
a
sergeant
he
was
fairly
drunk
it
happened
on
the
same
day
that
egorka
returned
home
to
his
mother
the
sergeant
entered
the
outer
courtyard
the
gates
of
which
happened
to
have
been
left
open
by
chance
a
strong
smell
of
vodka
came
from
him
with
the
suspicious
eye
of
an
inexperienced
spy
he
examined
the
barns
the
and
the
kitchen
he
wondered
stupidly
at
the
cleanliness
of
the
yard
and
the
tidiness
of
the
new
buildings
the
sergeant
was
about
to
enter
the
kitchen
in
order
to
talk
with
some
one
about
the
business
on
which
he
had
been
sent
when
quite
suddenly
he
saw
a
young
girl
one
of
the
instructresses
zinaida
she
walked
without
haste
in
the
yard
in
a
costume
that
reached
to
her
knees
zinaida
had
a
cheerful
simple
sunburnt
face
her
strong
bare
arms
swung
lightly
as
she
walked
it
seemed
as
if
the
graceful
girl
were
carried
upon
the
earth
without
visible
effort
the
chaste
openness
of
her
chaste
body
naturally
aroused
hideous
thoughts
in
the
idiot
and
was
it
possible
to
be
otherwise
in
our
dark
days
even
in
the
tale
of
a
poet
in
love
with
beauty
the
nudity
of
a
chaste
body
calls
out
the
judgment
of
hypocrites
and
the
rage
of
people
with
perverted
imaginations
as
if
it
were
the
arrogant
nudity
of
a
prostitute
the
austere
virtue
of
these
people
is
attached
to
them
externally
it
can
not
withstand
any
kind
of
temptation
or
enticement
they
know
this
and
cautiously
guard
themselves
from
seduction
but
in
secret
they
console
their
miserable
imaginations
with
unclean
pictures
of
lewdness
cheap
and
regulated
and
almost
undangerous
for
their
health
and
the
welfare
of
their
families
the
police
sergeant
upon
seeing
the
young
girl
so
lightly
dressed
gave
a
lewd
smile
his
unclean
desire
stirred
in
his
coarse
body
under
its
slovenly
sweaty
dress
he
beckoned
zinaida
to
him
with
his
crooked
dirty
finger
and
gave
an
idiotic
laugh
he
pushed
his
faded
cap
down
to
the
back
of
his
head
the
young
girl
walked
up
to
the
police
sergeant
with
a
light
easy
gait
thus
walk
queens
of
beloved
free
lands
barefoot
virgins
crowned
with
white
flowers
queens
of
lands
of
which
our
too
parisian
age
does
not
know
the
police
sergeant
whiffed
his
shag
vodka
and
garlic
at
zinaida
and
smiling
lasciviously
so
that
the
green
and
the
yellow
of
his
crooked
teeth
showed
conspicuously
he
said
my
pretty
girl
d
ye
live
here
zinaida
ingenuously
marvelled
at
his
red
dirty
hands
at
his
red
provokingly
perspiring
face
his
big
heavy
boots
and
all
those
external
tokens
of
the
deformity
of
our
poor
coarse
life
they
so
quickly
became
unused
to
this
deformity
here
in
the
valley
of
their
beloved
innocent
tranquil
life
zinaida
replied
with
an
involuntary
smile
yes
i
live
here
in
this
the
police
sergeant
asked
are
you
the
cook
or
the
laundress
what
a
nice
piece
of
you
are
he
burst
into
a
shrill
neighing
laugh
and
was
about
to
begin
his
offensively
affectionate
tactics
he
lifted
his
open
tawny
hand
and
aimed
his
forefinger
with
a
black
border
on
a
thick
yellow
towards
a
place
where
he
might
jab
pinch
or
tickle
the
barefoot
girl
but
zinaida
smiling
and
frowning
at
the
same
time
edged
away
from
him
and
answered
i
m
an
instructress
in
this
school
zinaida
the
sergeant
drawled
out
an
instructress
you
are
fibbing
he
did
not
believe
at
first
that
she
was
an
instructress
he
thought
that
she
was
the
cook
or
the
washerwoman
who
had
tucked
up
her
dress
in
order
to
wash
scour
or
cook
more
conveniently
and
that
she
was
joking
with
him
but
after
he
had
scrutinized
her
face
more
intently
a
face
such
as
a
cook
does
not
have
and
her
hands
such
as
a
washerwoman
does
not
have
he
suddenly
believed
with
astonishment
and
curiosity
zinaida
eyed
this
strange
coarse
offensively
affectionate
creature
with
the
heavy
sabre
in
a
black
sheath
dangling
about
his
legs
and
asked
and
who
are
you
the
sergeant
replied
with
a
very
important
air
i
am
the
local
police
he
tried
to
look
dignified
what
is
it
you
want
here
asked
zinaida
the
sergeant
turned
to
her
with
a
wink
and
asked
now
tell
me
my
beauty
have
you
a
runaway
boy
from
town
here
his
mother
is
looking
for
him
and
she
s
notified
the
police
if
he
s
here
with
you
we
ve
got
to
return
him
to
yes
said
zinaida
a
town
boy
did
spend
a
week
with
us
here
we
sent
him
home
only
he
s
very
likely
with
his
mother
the
sergeant
smiled
incredulously
and
asked
you
re
not
fibbing
zinaida
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
looked
sternly
at
the
man
and
said
in
astonishment
what
are
you
saying
how
is
it
possible
to
tell
an
untruth
and
why
should
i
tell
you
an
untruth
how
is
one
to
tell
growled
the
sergeant
once
i
begin
to
believe
you
there
are
lots
of
things
you
might
i
ve
told
you
the
truth
asserted
zinaida
once
more
well
just
be
careful
said
the
sergeant
with
dignity
we
ll
find
out
all
the
same
you
are
sure
you
ve
returned
him
home
yes
home
to
his
mother
replied
zinaida
very
well
i
shall
report
that
to
the
captain
of
the
he
told
a
lie
for
dignity
s
sake
it
was
the
commissary
of
the
police
who
sent
him
here
and
not
the
captain
but
it
was
all
the
same
to
zinaida
she
had
got
quite
accustomed
to
thinking
mostly
about
the
children
and
her
work
the
stern
reference
to
the
police
authorities
did
not
impress
her
very
much
the
police
sergeant
left
he
kept
up
his
broad
smile
he
looked
back
several
times
at
the
instructress
he
was
gay
and
flustered
all
the
way
to
town
his
thoughts
were
coarse
and
detestable
such
are
the
thoughts
of
the
savages
who
take
shelter
in
the
grey
expanses
of
our
towns
savages
who
hide
under
all
sorts
of
masks
and
who
strut
about
in
all
sorts
of
clothes
zinaida
looked
sadly
after
the
police
sergeant
coarse
recollections
of
former
days
revived
in
her
soul
now
full
of
delicious
soothings
of
a
different
blessed
existence
created
by
trirodov
in
the
quiet
coolness
of
the
beloved
wood
then
zinaida
sighed
as
if
awakened
from
a
midday
nightmare
she
went
quietly
her
own
way
in
the
course
of
several
days
trirodov
s
colony
was
visited
by
the
commissary
of
the
police
he
comprehended
and
considered
the
chaste
world
of
the
prosianiya
meadows
in
the
same
way
as
the
illiterate
sergeant
only
this
consideration
expressed
itself
in
a
milder
form
the
commissary
of
the
police
tried
to
be
very
amiable
he
paid
awkward
compliments
to
trirodov
and
his
instructresses
but
when
he
looked
at
the
instructresses
the
commissary
smiled
as
detestably
as
the
sergeant
his
small
narrow
eyes
which
resembled
those
of
a
kalmyk
became
oily
with
pleasure
his
cheeks
became
covered
with
a
ruddiness
when
the
girls
walked
off
to
one
side
he
gave
a
wink
at
trirodov
in
their
direction
and
said
in
a
a
flower
garden
eh
trirodov
looked
severely
at
the
commissary
who
became
flustered
and
rather
angry
he
said
i
have
come
to
you
i
m
sorry
to
say
on
unpleasant
indeed
he
came
under
the
pretext
of
discussing
the
arrangements
of
egorka
s
position
incidentally
he
hinted
that
the
illegal
opening
of
egorka
s
grave
might
give
cause
to
an
official
investigation
trirodov
gave
the
commissary
a
bribe
and
treated
him
to
lunch
the
commissary
of
the
police
left
in
high
spirits
at
last
trirodov
had
a
visit
from
the
captain
of
the
police
he
had
a
gloomy
inaccessible
look
he
began
quite
bluntly
about
the
illegal
digging
up
of
egorka
s
grave
trirodov
said
surely
it
was
impossible
to
leave
a
live
boy
to
suffocate
in
a
the
captain
replied
in
a
rather
austere
voice
you
should
have
notified
the
prior
of
the
cemetery
church
of
your
suspicions
he
would
have
done
all
there
was
to
be
but
think
how
much
time
would
have
been
lost
in
going
after
the
priest
said
trirodov
the
captain
without
listening
replied
it
s
irregular
what
would
become
of
us
if
every
one
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
open
up
graves
a
chap
might
do
it
to
steal
something
and
when
he
s
caught
he
might
say
that
he
s
heard
the
corpse
was
alive
and
turning
in
its
you
know
very
well
retorted
trirodov
that
we
didn
t
go
there
with
the
object
of
but
the
captain
reiterated
harshly
and
sternly
it
s
trirodov
invited
the
captain
to
dinner
the
captain
s
bribe
was
of
course
considerably
larger
than
the
commissary
s
after
a
sumptuous
dinner
and
drinks
and
the
bribe
the
captain
suddenly
became
softer
than
wax
he
began
to
dwell
on
the
difficulties
and
annoyances
of
his
position
then
trirodov
mentioned
the
search
that
had
been
made
lately
and
the
beating
the
instructress
maria
received
at
the
police
station
the
captain
flushed
with
embarrassment
and
said
with
some
warmth
upon
my
honour
it
didn
t
depend
upon
me
i
must
follow
orders
our
new
forgive
the
expression
is
a
regular
butcher
that
s
how
he
s
made
his
is
it
possible
to
make
one
s
career
by
such
means
asked
trirodov
the
captain
spoke
animatedly
and
it
was
evident
that
the
career
of
the
new
agitated
his
official
heart
considerably
the
facts
must
be
familiar
to
you
he
said
he
killed
his
friend
when
he
was
drunk
was
confined
in
a
lunatic
asylum
and
how
he
ever
got
out
is
beyond
comprehension
with
the
help
of
patronage
he
was
given
a
position
in
the
district
government
and
showed
himself
to
be
such
an
asp
that
every
one
marvelled
he
quickly
galloped
into
a
councillorship
he
subdued
the
peasants
of
course
you
must
have
heard
about
it
who
hasn
t
heard
about
it
asked
trirodov
quietly
the
newspapers
have
certainly
published
enough
about
him
the
captain
continued
sometimes
they
added
a
trifle
but
this
was
to
his
good
it
turned
every
one
s
attention
to
him
he
was
made
and
now
he
has
redoubled
his
efforts
and
is
trying
to
distinguish
himself
further
he
has
an
eye
on
the
governorship
he
is
sure
to
go
a
long
way
our
own
governor
is
on
his
guard
on
his
account
i
need
not
tell
you
what
a
powerful
arm
our
governor
has
in
petersburg
nevertheless
he
can
t
decide
to
thwart
ardalyon
borisovitch
and
yet
in
spite
of
that
you
do
please
consider
what
a
time
we
are
living
in
said
the
captain
there
never
was
anything
like
it
there
is
such
an
unrest
among
the
peasants
that
may
god
have
mercy
on
us
only
the
other
day
they
played
the
deuce
on
khavriukin
s
farm
they
carried
away
everything
that
could
be
carried
away
the
muzhiks
even
took
away
all
the
live
stock
a
pitiful
case
khavriukin
is
considered
among
the
better
masters
in
our
government
he
held
the
peasants
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
now
they
ve
paid
him
back
howsoever
it
may
have
happened
said
trirodov
still
you
did
whip
my
instructress
that
was
rather
please
exclaimed
the
captain
i
will
personally
ask
her
pardon
like
an
honest
trirodov
sent
for
maria
maria
came
the
captain
of
the
police
poured
out
his
apologies
before
her
and
covered
her
sunburnt
hands
with
kisses
maria
was
silent
her
face
was
pale
and
her
eyes
were
aflame
with
anger
the
captain
thought
cautiously
such
a
woman
would
not
stop
at
he
made
haste
to
take
his
leave
chapter
xxix
the
educational
police
also
conferred
its
presence
on
trirodov
s
school
in
the
person
of
the
inspector
of
the
national
schools
the
local
inspector
of
the
national
schools
leonty
andreyevitch
shabalov
had
served
all
his
life
in
remote
wooded
places
and
was
for
that
reason
quite
an
uncivilized
being
tall
robust
shaggy
unharmonious
he
resembled
even
in
external
appearance
a
bear
of
vologda
or
olonetz
his
face
was
overgrown
with
a
thick
beard
his
thick
hair
crept
down
his
low
forehead
towards
his
eyebrows
his
back
was
broad
and
somewhat
stooped
like
a
huge
trough
shabalov
frequently
said
to
the
instructors
and
instructresses
in
his
district
in
a
hoarse
drawl
batenka
or
golubushka
if
it
happened
to
be
an
instructress
brilliant
instructors
are
not
necessary
i
don
t
like
clever
men
and
women
i
m
no
respecter
of
modern
ladies
and
dandies
the
chief
thing
batenka
in
life
and
in
service
is
not
to
put
on
airs
in
my
opinion
batenka
if
you
perform
your
state
obligations
and
conduct
yourself
peacefully
you
will
find
yourself
well
off
the
educational
programme
has
been
worked
out
by
people
not
more
stupid
than
you
and
me
so
that
you
and
i
needn
t
spend
our
time
philosophizing
about
programmes
that
s
what
i
think
batenka
but
notwithstanding
all
his
respect
for
educational
programmes
shabalov
knew
the
educational
business
badly
it
would
be
truer
to
say
that
he
did
not
know
it
at
all
he
was
hardly
interested
in
it
he
was
not
even
very
literate
he
received
his
inspector
s
position
as
a
reward
for
his
piety
patriotism
and
correct
mode
of
thinking
rather
than
for
his
labours
in
the
interest
of
public
instruction
he
had
served
in
his
youth
as
a
class
assistant
in
the
gymnasia
there
by
a
steady
attendance
at
the
gymnasia
chapel
and
the
reading
of
the
apostles
in
a
stentorian
voice
he
turned
upon
himself
the
attention
of
an
old
bigot
of
a
general
s
wife
she
procured
him
the
inspector
s
position
there
was
no
way
in
which
he
could
help
the
young
and
instructors
when
he
visited
the
schools
he
limited
himself
to
a
superficial
examination
and
gave
the
pupils
several
stupid
questions
mostly
on
matters
of
piety
of
love
towards
the
fatherland
and
national
above
all
shabalov
loved
to
collect
rumours
and
gossip
he
did
this
with
great
ability
and
zeal
every
one
knew
this
weakness
of
his
consequently
there
were
many
eager
to
gossip
and
to
inform
against
some
one
there
were
even
a
number
of
informers
among
the
instructors
and
instructresses
who
wished
to
gain
favour
and
promotion
once
it
was
reported
to
shabalov
that
teachers
of
both
sexes
in
some
of
the
neighbouring
schools
had
gathered
one
holiday
eve
in
one
of
the
schools
and
sang
songs
there
he
immediately
sent
them
all
a
notification
composed
as
follows
the
school
district
of
rouban
no
skorodozh
of
inspector
of
the
national
schools
of
the
first
section
of
the
skorodozh
government
to
instructor
of
the
vikhliaevsky
rural
school
ksenofont
polupavlov
dear
sir
it
has
come
to
my
knowledge
that
on
the
evening
of
the
of
september
you
participated
at
a
meeting
of
instructors
and
instructresses
which
had
been
arranged
without
the
necessary
permit
and
that
you
sang
there
with
them
songs
of
a
worldly
and
reprehensible
character
therefore
dear
sir
i
beg
you
in
the
future
not
to
permit
yourself
similar
actions
unbecoming
to
your
schoolmaster
s
vocation
and
i
herewith
warn
you
that
at
a
repetition
of
such
behaviour
you
will
be
immediately
discharged
from
the
service
inspector
on
another
occasion
he
wrote
to
the
same
instructor
on
the
occasion
of
an
inspection
of
the
schools
of
the
section
intrusted
to
me
a
number
of
instructors
and
instructresses
and
you
dear
sir
among
that
number
have
transgressed
the
limits
of
the
programme
ratified
for
primary
schools
by
the
authorities
in
imparting
to
your
pupils
facts
from
history
and
geography
unnecessary
to
the
people
and
therefore
in
confirmation
of
certain
verbal
instructions
i
have
already
made
to
you
in
person
i
beg
you
in
the
future
to
maintain
strictly
the
established
programmes
and
i
warn
you
that
if
you
fail
to
comply
you
will
be
discharged
from
the
shabalov
was
particularly
displeased
with
the
participation
of
certain
instructors
and
instructresses
in
the
local
pedagogical
circle
this
circle
was
initiated
in
the
town
of
skorodozh
some
three
years
before
by
the
gymnasia
instructor
bodeyev
and
the
town
school
instructor
voronok
the
circle
discussed
various
questions
of
upbringing
instruction
and
school
affairs
generally
which
interested
in
those
years
many
teachers
and
parents
some
of
the
members
read
their
reports
here
it
was
particularly
provoking
to
shabalov
that
these
reports
occasionally
recounted
certain
episodes
in
school
life
and
eccentricities
of
the
educational
authorities
shabalov
wanted
to
discharge
the
audacious
ones
the
district
school
council
did
not
agree
with
him
then
followed
a
long
and
unpleasant
discussion
out
of
which
shabalov
did
not
issue
as
conqueror
trirodov
found
it
painful
and
difficult
to
talk
with
shabalov
shabalov
said
in
a
slow
creaking
voice
giorgiy
sergeyevitch
you
will
have
to
send
your
wards
to
town
for
why
is
it
necessary
asked
trirodov
shabalov
laughed
his
creaking
laugh
and
said
well
it
s
necessary
we
ll
give
them
what
s
the
use
of
your
certificates
to
them
asked
trirodov
they
need
knowledge
and
not
certificates
your
certificates
won
t
feed
their
the
certificates
are
necessary
for
military
service
explained
shabalov
they
will
remain
pupils
here
said
trirodov
until
they
are
ready
for
practical
work
or
for
scientific
and
artistic
occupations
then
some
of
them
will
go
to
technical
schools
others
to
universities
why
then
should
they
have
certificates
for
a
course
in
a
primary
school
shabalov
repeated
dully
and
stubbornly
things
are
not
done
that
way
your
school
is
counted
among
the
primary
schools
those
who
have
completed
the
course
should
receive
certificates
how
else
can
it
be
judge
for
yourself
and
if
you
wish
to
go
beyond
the
primary
course
then
you
ll
have
to
procure
for
yourself
a
private
gymnasia
or
a
professional
school
or
if
you
like
a
commercial
one
but
what
you
want
is
impossible
and
of
course
you
d
have
to
engage
real
teachers
in
place
of
your
cheap
my
barefoots
retorted
trirodov
have
the
same
diplomas
and
learning
as
the
real
teachers
to
use
your
expression
it
is
strange
that
you
do
not
know
or
realize
that
fact
and
they
receive
such
ample
pay
from
me
that
i
should
hesitate
to
call
them
cheap
generally
speaking
it
seems
to
me
that
in
its
relation
to
private
schools
the
educational
council
would
do
well
to
limit
itself
to
an
external
police
surveillance
of
a
purely
negative
character
they
should
merely
see
whether
we
commit
anything
of
a
criminal
nature
but
what
business
have
you
with
the
direction
of
schools
you
have
so
few
schools
of
your
own
and
yet
they
are
so
poor
that
you
have
quite
a
time
to
attend
to
shabalov
somewhat
subdued
replied
still
the
examination
will
have
to
be
held
surely
you
understand
that
and
the
headmaster
of
the
national
schools
is
anxious
to
be
present
at
the
examination
we
have
our
instructions
from
the
ministry
and
it
is
impossible
to
discuss
the
matter
our
business
is
to
execute
come
here
yourselves
if
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
hold
an
examination
said
trirodov
coldly
very
well
said
shabalov
upon
reflection
i
will
report
your
wish
to
the
headmaster
of
the
national
schools
i
don
t
know
how
he
will
look
upon
the
matter
but
i
will
make
my
then
he
reflected
again
briefly
he
rubbed
his
back
covered
by
its
blue
official
frock
against
the
back
of
his
chair
the
greasy
faded
cloth
against
the
handsome
leather
and
said
if
the
headmaster
agrees
to
it
we
will
appoint
the
day
and
send
you
the
notification
that
you
may
expect
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
shabalov
sent
the
announcement
that
the
examination
in
trirodov
s
school
was
appointed
to
be
held
on
may
at
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
on
the
premises
this
meddling
on
the
part
of
the
educational
police
annoyed
trirodov
but
he
had
to
submit
to
it
chapter
xxx
kirsha
was
acquainted
with
many
boys
in
town
some
of
them
were
pupils
of
the
gymnasia
some
of
the
town
school
kirsha
was
also
acquainted
with
some
of
the
students
who
attended
the
girls
gymnasia
he
told
his
father
a
great
deal
about
the
affairs
and
ways
of
these
institutions
his
information
contained
much
that
was
singular
and
unexpected
the
personality
of
the
headmaster
of
the
national
schools
doulebov
particularly
interested
trirodov
of
late
the
schools
under
his
guidance
included
the
school
established
by
trirodov
though
doulebov
contributed
nothing
to
the
school
he
conducted
himself
with
complete
indifference
to
the
aspersions
cast
at
priest
zakrasin
and
did
not
defend
him
before
the
diocesan
bishop
he
and
his
subordinate
the
inspector
showered
official
papers
upon
trirodov
and
demanded
various
reports
in
the
established
form
so
that
trirodov
had
to
prevail
upon
a
small
official
of
the
exchequer
to
come
evenings
and
copy
out
all
this
absurd
nonsense
but
neither
doulebov
nor
shabalov
looked
in
even
once
into
trirodov
s
school
when
trirodov
happened
to
be
in
the
headmaster
s
office
the
conversation
usually
turned
on
documents
concerning
the
instructresses
and
various
petty
formalities
the
calumnies
of
ostrov
and
of
his
friends
in
the
black
hundred
disturbed
doulebov
to
avoid
unpleasantness
doulebov
decided
to
take
advantage
of
the
first
opportunity
to
close
trirodov
s
school
the
headmaster
of
the
national
schools
actual
state
councillor
grigory
vladimirovitch
doulebov
had
his
eye
on
a
higher
position
in
the
educational
department
that
was
why
he
tried
to
gain
favour
by
showing
a
meticulous
attentiveness
to
his
duties
his
perseverance
was
astonishing
he
never
gave
an
impression
of
haste
his
reception
of
subordinates
and
petitioners
announced
on
a
placard
on
his
door
to
take
place
on
thursdays
between
one
and
three
actually
began
at
eleven
in
the
morning
and
continued
until
late
in
the
evening
doulebov
spoke
with
each
visitor
slowly
and
showed
his
interest
in
the
slightest
detail
but
doulebov
of
course
knew
very
well
that
however
great
was
his
attentiveness
to
his
duties
that
in
itself
would
not
take
him
very
far
it
was
indispensable
to
cultivate
the
proper
personages
doulebov
had
no
influential
aunts
and
grandmothers
and
he
had
to
make
efforts
on
his
own
behalf
and
in
the
whole
course
of
his
years
service
beginning
as
a
gymnasia
instructor
doulebov
uninterruptedly
and
skilfully
concerned
himself
with
establishing
improved
relations
with
all
who
were
higher
in
rank
than
he
or
equal
with
him
he
even
made
an
effort
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
the
younger
set
that
was
for
an
emergency
for
who
can
tell
the
younger
sometimes
go
ahead
of
the
old
and
being
young
they
might
do
one
an
injury
or
a
good
service
when
the
opportunity
offered
never
to
commit
an
untactful
action
in
that
consisted
the
chief
precept
of
doubelov
s
life
he
knew
very
well
that
this
or
that
action
was
not
good
in
itself
and
that
the
chief
thing
was
how
they
would
look
upon
it
they
that
is
the
authorities
the
authorities
were
favourably
inclined
towards
doulebov
he
had
already
been
almost
promised
an
assistantship
to
the
head
of
the
educational
district
doulebov
adopted
an
attitude
towards
his
subordinates
consistent
with
this
personal
attitude
to
those
who
acted
respectfully
towards
him
and
his
wife
he
gave
his
patronage
and
made
efforts
to
improve
their
position
he
defended
them
in
unpleasant
situations
though
very
cautiously
in
order
not
to
hurt
his
own
position
he
was
not
very
fond
of
those
who
were
disrespectful
and
independent
and
he
hindered
them
all
he
could
recognizing
a
rising
luminary
in
the
newly
appointed
who
lately
had
been
a
councillor
in
the
district
government
doulebov
tried
to
come
into
agreeable
relations
with
him
also
but
he
conducted
himself
towards
him
very
cautiously
so
that
he
might
not
be
suspected
of
too
intimate
relations
with
this
evil
morose
badly
trained
man
and
his
vulgar
wife
doulebov
had
pleasant
manners
a
youngish
face
and
a
slender
voice
which
resembled
the
squeal
of
a
young
pig
he
was
light
and
agile
in
his
movements
no
one
had
ever
seen
him
drunk
and
as
a
visitor
he
either
did
not
drink
at
all
or
limited
himself
to
a
glass
of
madeira
he
was
always
accompanied
by
his
wife
it
was
said
that
she
managed
all
his
affairs
and
that
doulebov
obeyed
her
implicitly
in
everything
the
wife
of
the
headmaster
zinaida
grigorievna
was
a
plump
energetic
and
shrewish
woman
her
short
hair
was
beginning
to
get
grey
she
was
very
jealous
of
her
influence
and
maintained
it
with
great
energy
at
doulebov
s
invitation
the
visited
the
town
school
in
inviting
the
doulebov
had
especially
in
view
the
idea
of
taking
him
to
the
trirodov
school
in
the
event
of
the
school
being
closed
he
wanted
to
say
that
it
was
done
at
the
instigation
of
the
governmental
authorities
but
doulebov
did
not
wish
to
invite
the
direct
to
trirodov
s
school
so
as
to
give
no
one
any
reason
for
saying
that
he
did
it
on
purpose
that
was
why
he
persuaded
the
to
come
to
the
examination
at
the
town
school
on
the
eve
of
the
day
appointed
for
the
examinations
at
the
trirodov
school
the
town
school
was
situated
in
one
of
the
dirty
side
streets
its
exterior
was
highly
unattractive
the
dirty
dilapidated
wooden
structure
seemed
as
if
it
were
built
for
a
tavern
rather
than
for
a
school
this
did
not
prevent
doulebov
from
saying
to
the
inspector
of
the
school
the
new
will
visit
you
i
invited
him
to
you
because
you
have
such
a
fine
inspector
poterin
fawning
before
doulebov
and
his
wife
said
in
a
flustered
way
our
building
is
anything
but
doulebov
smiled
amiably
and
replied
encouragingly
the
building
is
not
the
important
thing
the
school
itself
is
good
the
instruction
is
to
be
valued
and
not
the
the
arrived
rather
late
at
eleven
together
with
zherbenev
who
was
an
honorary
overseer
of
the
school
there
was
a
very
tense
feeling
in
the
school
the
instructors
and
the
students
alike
trembled
before
the
authorities
stupid
and
vulgar
scenes
with
the
headmaster
in
the
town
school
were
common
with
doulebov
and
did
not
embarrass
him
as
for
doulebov
and
his
wife
they
were
fully
alive
to
their
importance
they
had
received
only
two
or
three
days
before
definite
news
of
the
appointment
of
doulebov
as
assistant
to
the
head
of
the
educational
department
inspector
shabalov
arrived
at
the
school
very
early
that
day
he
occupied
himself
with
attentions
to
zinaida
grigorievna
doulebova
to
whom
he
showed
various
services
with
an
unexpected
and
rather
vulgar
amiableness
the
mikhail
prokopievitch
poterin
conducted
himself
like
a
lackey
it
was
even
evident
at
times
that
he
trembled
before
the
doulebovs
what
reason
had
he
to
be
afraid
he
was
a
great
patriot
a
member
of
the
black
hundred
he
accepted
bribes
beat
his
pupils
drank
considerably
and
he
always
got
off
easily
zinaida
grigorievna
doulebova
examined
the
graduating
classes
in
french
and
english
these
studies
were
optional
inspector
poterin
s
wife
gave
instruction
in
french
she
had
not
yet
fully
mastered
the
berlitz
method
and
looked
at
the
doulebovs
cringingly
but
at
heart
she
was
bitter
at
her
poverty
abjectness
and
dependence
poterin
knew
no
languages
but
he
was
also
present
here
and
hissed
malignantly
at
those
who
answered
awkwardly
or
did
not
answer
at
all
blockhead
numskull
doulebova
sat
motionless
and
made
no
sign
that
she
heard
this
zealous
hissing
and
these
coarse
words
she
would
give
freedom
to
her
tongue
later
at
luncheon
a
luncheon
had
been
prepared
for
the
visitors
and
the
instructors
it
cost
poterin
s
wife
much
trouble
and
anxiety
the
table
was
set
in
the
large
room
where
on
ordinary
days
the
small
boys
made
lively
and
wrangled
in
they
were
excluded
on
this
day
and
raised
a
racket
outside
doulebova
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
between
the
and
zherbenev
doulebov
sat
next
to
the
a
pie
was
brought
in
then
tea
zinaida
grigorievna
abused
the
instructors
wives
and
the
instructresses
she
loved
gossip
indeed
who
does
not
the
instructors
wives
gossiped
to
her
during
the
luncheon
the
small
boys
having
resumed
their
places
in
the
neighbouring
class
sang
songs
what
songs
our
russia
does
sing
do
what
you
like
though
you
burst
frenchman
you
ll
never
sing
like
and
other
songs
in
the
same
spirit
doulebov
wiped
his
face
with
his
right
hand
like
a
cat
licking
its
paw
and
piped
out
i
hear
that
the
marquis
teliatnikov
is
to
pay
us
a
visit
we
are
not
within
his
jurisdiction
said
poterin
but
his
whole
face
became
distorted
with
apprehension
all
the
same
said
doulebov
in
his
thin
voice
he
possesses
great
powers
he
can
do
what
he
the
looked
gloomily
at
poterin
and
said
morosely
he
s
going
to
pull
you
all
poterin
grew
deathly
pale
and
broke
out
into
perspiration
the
conversation
about
the
marquis
teliatnikov
continued
and
the
local
revolutionary
ferment
was
mentioned
in
the
course
of
it
revolutionary
proclamations
had
appeared
in
all
the
woods
of
the
neighbourhood
large
pieces
of
bark
were
cut
off
the
trees
and
proclamations
pasted
on
it
was
impossible
to
remove
these
bills
which
were
overrun
by
a
thin
transparent
coating
of
resin
the
zealous
preservers
of
order
had
either
to
chop
out
or
to
scrape
off
the
obnoxious
places
with
a
knife
i
think
said
doulebova
that
it
must
be
an
idea
of
our
chemist
of
she
was
confirmed
in
her
suggestion
by
the
cringing
instructress
of
german
zinaida
grigorievna
turned
towards
poterina
in
order
to
show
favour
to
her
hostess
by
her
conversation
and
asked
her
with
an
amused
smile
how
do
you
like
our
celebrated
decadent
the
instructress
tried
to
understand
an
expression
of
fear
showed
on
her
flat
dull
face
she
asked
timidly
whom
do
you
mean
zinaida
grigorievna
whom
else
could
i
mean
but
trirodov
replied
doulebova
malignantly
the
malice
was
all
on
trirodov
s
account
but
nevertheless
poterina
trembled
with
fear
ah
yes
trirodov
how
then
how
then
she
repeated
in
a
worried
flustered
way
and
was
at
a
loss
what
to
say
doulebova
said
bitingly
well
i
don
t
think
he
laughs
very
often
he
ought
to
be
to
your
to
my
taste
exclaimed
poterina
with
a
flushed
face
what
are
you
saying
zinaida
grigorievna
as
the
old
saying
goes
the
tsar
s
servant
has
been
bent
into
a
harness
arch
yes
he
always
looks
askance
at
you
and
talks
to
no
one
said
the
wife
of
the
instructor
krolikov
but
he
is
a
very
kind
doulebova
turned
her
malignant
glance
upon
her
krolikova
grew
pale
with
fear
and
guessed
that
she
had
not
said
the
right
thing
she
corrected
herself
he
is
a
kind
man
in
his
doulebova
smiled
at
her
benevolently
do
you
know
what
i
think
said
zherbenev
addressing
himself
to
doulebova
i
have
seen
many
men
in
my
time
i
may
say
without
boasting
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
a
very
bad
sign
that
he
looks
askance
at
of
course
agreed
poterina
that
is
the
honest
truth
let
a
man
look
me
straight
in
my
face
went
on
zherbenev
but
the
quiet
ones
zherbenev
did
not
finish
his
sentence
doulebova
said
frankly
i
don
t
like
your
poet
i
can
t
understand
him
there
is
something
strange
about
him
something
he
s
altogether
suspicious
said
zherbenev
with
the
look
of
a
person
who
knew
a
great
deal
it
was
asserted
that
trirodov
and
others
were
collecting
money
for
an
armed
revolt
at
this
they
looked
significantly
at
voronok
voronok
retorted
but
he
was
not
heard
there
was
an
outburst
of
malignant
remarks
against
trirodov
it
was
said
that
there
was
a
secret
underground
printing
establishment
in
trirodov
s
house
and
that
not
only
the
instructresses
worked
there
but
also
trirodov
s
young
wards
the
women
exclaimed
in
horror
they
are
mere
tots
what
do
you
think
of
your
tots
now
there
are
no
children
i
ve
just
heard
said
voronok
that
a
boy
is
kept
in
confinement
by
the
the
young
rebel
said
the
savagely
yes
and
i
ve
also
heard
said
poterin
that
a
boy
has
been
arrested
such
a
little
beggar
and
already
in
the
said
morosely
he
s
going
with
his
grandfather
to
why
asked
voronok
with
a
flushed
face
he
laughed
growled
the
morosely
doulebov
turned
to
poterin
and
asked
in
a
loud
voice
and
i
hope
you
have
no
rebels
in
your
no
thank
god
i
have
nothing
of
that
kind
replied
poterin
but
to
tell
the
truth
the
children
are
very
loose
doulebov
with
a
patronizing
amiableness
said
again
to
him
you
have
a
good
school
everything
is
in
exemplary
poterin
grew
radiant
and
boasted
yes
i
know
how
to
pull
them
up
i
treat
them
a
salutary
sternness
said
doulebov
encouraged
by
these
words
the
asked
do
you
think
one
might
also
beat
them
doulebov
avoided
a
direct
answer
he
wiped
his
face
with
his
hand
like
a
cat
using
its
paw
and
changed
the
subject
they
began
touching
recollections
about
the
good
old
times
they
began
to
relate
how
where
and
whom
they
birched
they
birch
even
now
said
shabalov
with
a
quiet
joy
chapter

after
luncheon
they
went
into
the
assembly
room
some
of
them
began
to
smoke
instructor
mouralov
s
wife
took
advantage
of
an
opportune
moment
to
speak
to
doulebova
she
cautiously
stole
up
to
her
when
she
saw
her
standing
aside
and
told
her
that
poterin
took
bribes
separate
phrases
and
words
were
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
the
conversation
have
you
noticed
zinaida
grigorievna
what
s
that
our
inspector
is
parading
in
yes
gloves
yellow
ones
what
of
that
out
of
zinaida
grigorievna
was
overjoyed
and
grew
animated
for
a
long
time
the
whispers
of
the
malicious
women
were
audible
and
between
their
whispers
their
hissing
laughter
then
the
women
together
with
shabalov
and
voronok
went
off
to
finish
the
examination
doulebov
and
the
went
in
to
look
at
the
library
poterin
accompanied
them
everything
was
in
order
the
thick
volumes
of
katkov
quietly
slumbered
the
dust
had
been
wiped
from
them
on
the
eve
of
the
s
visit
poterin
made
use
of
an
opportunity
to
make
insinuations
against
the
instructors
he
reported
that
voronok
did
not
go
to
church
and
that
he
collected
schoolboys
at
his
own
house
in
order
to
read
something
or
other
to
them
i
shall
have
to
have
a
talk
with
him
said
doulebov
ask
him
into
your
study
and
i
will
talk
to
him
in
the
meantime
show
ardalyon
borisovitch
the
doulebov
and
voronok
spoke
for
a
long
time
in
poterin
s
study
i
don
t
question
your
convictions
said
the
headmaster
but
i
must
make
it
clear
to
you
that
it
is
impossible
to
introduce
politics
into
schools
children
can
not
discuss
such
questions
it
does
them
agents
reports
are
not
always
to
be
believed
said
voronok
restrainedly
doulebov
flushed
slightly
and
said
in
an
annoyed
manner
we
don
t
maintain
agents
but
we
have
many
acquaintances
we
have
lived
here
a
long
time
it
is
impossible
not
to
hear
what
is
told
the
honorary
overseer
zherbenev
invited
all
who
attended
the
examination
to
his
house
to
dinner
only
voronok
refused
the
invitation
but
zherbenev
invited
others
to
the
dinner
the
general
s
widow
glafira
pavlovna
and
kerbakh
among
them
it
was
a
long
and
lavish
dinner
the
guests
drank
much
during
and
after
the
meal
every
one
got
tipsy
doulebov
alone
remained
sober
the
liqueurs
only
made
him
look
slightly
ruddier
he
was
very
fond
of
them
the
members
of
the
black
hundred
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
to
say
something
malicious
about
trirodov
to
doulebov
and
the
the
trirodov
school
began
to
be
discussed
rather
vulgarly
he
s
taken
up
photography
quite
keen
on
he
calls
in
children
makes
them
take
everything
off
and
photographs
yes
and
he
s
got
naked
children
running
about
in
the
children
the
instructresses
too
they
may
not
be
exactly
naked
but
they
are
always
running
about
just
like
peasant
women
said
zherbenev
yes
said
the
it
is
very
immoral
for
women
to
go
about
barefoot
it
must
be
they
are
poor
people
said
some
one
it
is
pornography
said
the
savagely
and
every
one
suddenly
believed
him
the
said
morosely
he
s
lodged
a
complaint
against
us
for
whipping
his
instructress
but
he
is
lying
he
s
whipped
her
himself
we
have
no
need
of
whipping
girls
but
he
does
it
because
he
s
a
corrupt
some
one
made
the
observation
that
trirodov
was
friends
with
dangerous
sects
at
which
kerbakh
remarked
he
now
has
horses
and
carriages
but
i
know
a
man
who
knew
him
when
he
had
only
his
shirt
it
is
rather
suspicious
as
to
where
he
got
his
glafira
pavlovna
looked
at
shabalov
and
whispered
to
doulebov
i
know
he
is
a
patriot
but
he
has
terrible
doulebov
said
i
know
he
is
very
stupid
and
undeveloped
but
zealous
if
directed
properly
he
can
be
very
next
morning
the
headmaster
of
the
national
schools
accompanied
by
the
and
shabalov
started
in
their
carriages
from
the
headmaster
s
offices
and
drove
off
to
trirodov
s
school
in
the
prosianiya
meadows
they
had
not
yet
fully
recovered
from
the
previous
day
s
carouse
they
carried
on
their
indecent
conversations
in
the
midst
of
nature
s
loveliness
they
looked
like
a
lot
of
picnickers
zinaida
grigorievna
and
kerbakh
who
were
in
one
carriage
were
engaged
in
a
malicious
conversation
they
tore
their
acquaintances
to
shreds
she
began
with
poterin
s
gloves
then
she
related
about
the
suicide
of
another
inspector
s
mistress
she
drowned
herself
because
she
was
about
to
have
a
child
then
she
told
about
a
third
inspector
who
got
drunk
in
a
and
got
into
a
tussle
there
with
the
mayor
of
the
town
shabalov
was
riding
in
a
trap
with
zherbenev
it
would
be
good
to
have
a
tasty
snack
he
said
we
are
sure
to
get
something
there
replied
zherbenev
confidently
the
visitors
were
all
confident
that
they
were
being
awaited
zinaida
grigorievna
said
the
most
interesting
part
of
it
will
be
hidden
of
yes
but
we
ll
it
was
a
fresh
early
morning
the
road
went
through
the
wood
they
had
now
driven
for
a
long
time
it
seemed
as
if
the
same
meadows
and
woods
copses
streams
and
bridges
repeated
themselves
again
and
again
they
began
to
ask
the
drivers
are
you
sure
you
re
going
the
right
way
perhaps
you
ve
lost
your
i
think
it
s
in
that
the
two
towers
of
trirodov
s
house
soon
became
visible
they
appeared
to
the
right
and
yet
it
was
impossible
to
find
the
way
to
them
for
a
long
time
they
blundered
the
roads
spread
and
branched
out
at
this
point
at
last
the
driver
of
the
first
carriage
stopped
his
horses
and
behind
it
the
other
carriages
came
to
a
standstill
i
ll
have
to
ask
some
one
said
the
driver
there
s
some
sort
of
a
boy
coming
this
a
barefoot
boy
could
be
seen
coming
down
the
road
from
the
wood
shabalov
shouted
savagely
at
him
stop
the
boy
glanced
at
the
carriages
and
calmly
walked
on
shabalov
cried
more
furiously
this
time
stop
you
young
brat
off
with
your
cap
don
t
you
see
that
gentlemen
are
coming
why
don
t
you
bow
to
them
the
boy
paused
he
looked
in
astonishment
at
the
variety
of
carriages
and
did
not
take
his
cap
off
doulebova
decided
he
s
simply
an
idiot
well
we
shall
make
him
talk
said
kerbakh
he
left
his
carriage
and
going
up
to
the
boy
asked
him
do
you
know
where
trirodov
s
school
is
the
boy
silently
pointed
to
one
of
the
roads
with
his
hand
then
he
ran
off
quickly
and
disappeared
somewhere
among
the
bushes
at
last
the
road
went
along
a
fence
everything
all
around
seemed
deserted
and
quiet
evidently
no
one
awaited
the
visitors
or
had
arranged
to
meet
them
finally
they
reached
the
gates
of
the
enclosure
they
looked
around
it
was
very
quiet
no
one
was
visible
anywhere
shabalov
jumped
out
of
his
trap
and
began
to
look
for
the
bell
madame
doulebova
said
in
great
irritation
what
do
you
think
of
that
they
tried
to
open
the
small
gate
by
themselves
but
were
unable
shabalov
cried
out
open
the
gate
you
devils
demons
sinners
madame
doulebova
tried
to
soothe
shabalov
who
justified
himself
forgive
me
zinaida
grigorievna
it
is
most
annoying
if
i
had
come
myself
i
shouldn
t
have
minded
waiting
though
even
then
it
would
have
been
discourteous
being
after
all
an
official
and
here
the
higher
authorities
have
announced
their
coming
and
these
people
pay
absolutely
no
attention
to
at
last
the
small
gate
opened
suddenly
and
noiselessly
a
boy
sunburnt
and
barefoot
in
a
white
shirt
and
short
white
breeches
stood
on
the
threshold
the
angry
doulebov
said
in
his
thin
shrill
voice
is
this
trirodov
s
school
yes
said
the
boy
the
visitors
entered
and
found
themselves
in
a
small
glade
three
barefoot
girls
slowly
came
to
meet
them
these
were
instructresses
nadezhda
vestchezerova
looked
with
her
large
dark
eyes
at
madame
doulebova
who
whispered
to
the
have
a
look
at
her
this
girl
had
a
scandal
in
her
life
but
he
s
taken
her
doulebova
knew
every
one
in
town
and
she
knew
especially
well
those
who
have
had
an
unpleasant
experience
of
some
sort
presently
trirodov
appeared
in
a
white
summer
suit
he
looked
with
an
ironic
smile
at
the
gaily
dressed
party
of
visitors
the
visitors
were
met
with
courtesy
but
the
headmaster
was
displeased
because
no
honour
was
shown
them
and
no
special
preparations
were
evident
the
instructresses
were
dressed
as
simply
as
always
doulebov
was
especially
displeased
because
both
the
instructresses
and
their
pupils
walked
about
barefoot
the
na√Øvet√©
of
the
children
irritated
the
visitors
the
children
looked
at
the
party
indifferently
some
of
them
nodded
a
greeting
others
did
not
take
off
your
cap
shouted
shabalov
the
boy
pulled
his
cap
off
and
reached
it
out
to
shabalov
with
the
remark
here
shabalov
growled
savagely
idiot
then
he
turned
away
the
boy
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
doulebov
and
even
more
his
wife
were
terribly
annoyed
because
they
had
not
put
on
more
clothes
for
their
visitors
not
even
shoes
the
looked
dully
and
savagely
everything
displeased
him
at
once
doulebov
asked
with
a
frown
surely
they
are
not
always
like
that
always
vladimir
grigorievitch
replied
trirodov
they
have
got
used
to
but
it
is
indecent
said
madame
doulebova
it
is
the
one
thing
that
is
decent
retorted
trirodov
chapter

the
windows
of
the
house
in
the
small
glade
were
wide
open
the
twitter
of
birds
was
audible
and
the
fresh
delicious
aroma
of
flowers
entered
in
it
was
here
the
children
gathered
and
the
miserable
farce
of
the
examination
began
doulebov
stood
up
before
an
ikon
on
one
side
of
the
room
assumed
a
stately
air
and
exclaimed
children
rise
to
the
children
rose
doulebov
thrust
a
finger
forward
towards
a
boy
s
breast
and
shouted
read
boy
the
thin
shrill
outcry
and
the
movement
of
the
finger
towards
the
child
s
breast
were
so
unexpected
by
the
boy
that
he
trembled
and
gave
a
choking
sound
some
one
behind
him
laughed
another
gave
an
amused
chuckle
doulebova
exchanged
glances
with
kerbakh
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
her
face
expressed
horror
the
boy
quickly
recovered
himself
and
read
the
prayer
sit
down
children
ordered
doulebov
the
children
resumed
their
places
while
the
elders
seated
themselves
at
a
table
in
the
order
of
their
rank
the
and
doulebov
in
the
middle
with
the
others
to
their
right
and
left
doulebova
looked
round
with
an
anxious
angry
expression
at
last
she
said
in
a
bass
voice
extraordinarily
coarse
for
a
woman
shut
the
windows
the
birds
are
making
a
noise
and
the
wind
too
it
is
impossible
to
do
trirodov
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
he
said
quietly
to
nadezhda
close
the
windows
our
guests
can
t
stand
fresh
the
windows
were
shut
the
children
looked
with
melancholy
tedium
at
the
depressing
writing
exercises
were
given
a
little
tale
was
read
aloud
from
a
reader
brought
by
shabalov
doulebov
asked
the
class
to
compose
it
in
their
own
words
the
boys
and
girls
were
about
to
pick
up
their
pens
but
doulebov
stopped
them
and
delivered
a
long
and
tedious
dissertation
on
how
to
write
the
given
composition
then
he
said
now
you
can
write
the
children
wrote
it
was
quiet
the
writers
handed
in
their
papers
to
their
instructresses
doulebov
and
shabalov
looked
them
over
there
and
then
they
tried
to
find
mistakes
but
there
were
few
then
dictation
was
given
doulebova
looked
morosely
the
whole
while
and
blinked
often
trirodov
tried
to
enter
into
conversation
with
her
but
the
angry
dame
answered
so
haughtily
that
it
was
with
great
difficulty
he
refrained
from
smiling
and
finally
he
left
the
malicious
woman
to
herself
after
the
written
exercises
trirodov
asked
the
uninvited
guests
to
luncheon
it
was
such
a
long
journey
here
said
doulebov
as
if
he
were
explaining
why
he
did
not
refuse
the
invitation
to
eat
the
children
scattered
a
short
way
into
the
wood
while
the
elders
went
into
a
neighbouring
house
where
the
luncheon
was
ready
the
conversation
during
luncheon
was
constrained
and
captious
the
doulebovs
tried
all
sorts
of
pinpricks
and
coarse
insinuations
their
companions
followed
suit
every
one
tried
to
outdo
the
other
in
saying
caustic
spiteful
things
doulebov
looked
with
simulated
horror
at
trirodov
s
instructresses
who
happened
to
be
present
and
whispered
to
kerbakh
their
feet
are
soiled
with
after
luncheon
they
returned
to
the
school
all
resumed
their
former
places
then
the
oral
examination
began
doulebov
bent
over
the
and
called
out
three
boys
at
once
each
of
them
was
questioned
first
about
the
holy
scriptures
and
immediately
afterwards
about
the
russian
language
and
arithmetic
the
examiners
cavilled
at
everything
nothing
satisfied
doulebov
he
gave
questions
the
answers
to
which
were
bound
to
make
evident
whether
higher
feelings
were
being
instilled
in
the
children
of
love
for
the
fatherland
of
allegiance
to
the
tsar
and
of
devotion
to
the
orthodox
church
he
asked
one
boy
which
country
is
better
russia
or
france
the
boy
thought
a
while
and
said
i
don
t
know
it
depends
upon
which
place
a
man
is
used
to
there
he
is
better
doulebova
laughed
viperously
shabalov
said
in
a
preceptorial
manner
the
orthodox
russia
is
it
possible
to
compare
any
kingdom
with
ours
have
you
heard
how
our
native
land
is
called
holy
russia
mother
russia
the
holy
russian
soil
and
you
are
an
idiot
blockhead
a
little
swine
if
you
don
t
like
your
fatherland
what
are
you
good
for
the
boy
flushed
tiny
tears
gleamed
in
his
eyes
doulebov
asked
now
tell
me
what
is
the
very
best
faith
in
this
the
boy
fell
into
thought
shabalov
asked
malignantly
can
t
you
answer
even
that
the
boy
said
when
one
believes
sincerely
then
it
is
the
very
best
faith
for
what
a
blockhead
said
shabalov
with
conviction
trirodov
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
he
said
quietly
the
sincerity
of
religious
mood
is
surely
the
best
indication
of
a
saving
we
ll
discuss
that
later
piped
out
doulebov
sternly
this
is
not
a
convenient
as
you
like
said
trirodov
with
a
smile
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
when
you
discuss
doulebov
red
with
agitation
rose
from
his
chair
and
going
up
to
trirodov
said
to
him
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
have
a
talk
with
at
your
service
said
trirodov
not
without
some
astonishment
please
continue
said
doulebov
to
shabalov
doulebov
and
trirodov
went
into
the
next
room
their
conversation
soon
assumed
a
very
sharp
character
doulebov
made
some
savage
accusations
and
said
rather
vehemently
i
have
heard
improper
things
about
your
school
but
indeed
the
reality
exceeds
all
what
is
there
precisely
improper
asked
trirodov
in
what
way
has
reality
surpassed
gossip
i
don
t
collect
gossip
squealed
doulebov
excitedly
i
see
with
my
own
eyes
this
is
not
a
school
but
a
pornography
his
voice
had
already
passed
into
piggish
tones
he
struck
the
table
with
his
palm
there
was
the
hard
sound
of
the
against
the
wood
trirodov
said
i
too
have
heard
that
you
were
a
man
with
but
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
i
ve
noticed
your
violent
doulebov
made
an
effort
to
recover
himself
he
said
more
quietly
it
is
a
revolting
pornography
and
what
do
you
call
pornography
asked
trirodov
don
t
you
know
said
doulebov
with
a
sarcastic
smile
yes
i
know
said
trirodov
in
my
conception
every
written
lechery
and
disfigurement
of
beautiful
truth
to
gratify
the
low
instincts
of
the
that
is
pornography
your
state
school
that
is
the
true
example
of
they
walk
about
naked
here
squealed
doulebov
trirodov
retorted
they
will
be
healthier
and
cleaner
than
those
children
who
leave
your
doulebov
shouted
even
your
instructresses
walk
about
naked
you
ve
taken
on
depraved
girls
as
trirodov
replied
calmly
that
s
a
lie
the
headmaster
said
sharply
and
excitedly
your
school
if
this
awful
impossible
establishment
can
be
called
a
school
will
be
closed
at
once
i
will
make
the
application
to
the
district
trirodov
replied
sharply
that
you
can
soon
the
visitors
left
in
an
ugly
frame
of
mind
doulebova
hissed
and
waxed
indignant
the
whole
way
back
he
s
clearly
a
dangerous
man
observed
kerbakh
chapter
xxxiii
piotr
and
rameyev
arrived
at
trirodov
s
together
rameyev
more
than
once
said
to
piotr
that
he
had
been
very
rude
to
trirodov
and
that
he
ought
to
smooth
out
matters
somehow
piotr
agreed
very
unwillingly
once
more
they
talked
about
the
war
trirodov
asked
rameyev
i
think
you
see
only
a
political
significance
in
this
and
do
you
disagree
with
me
asked
rameyev
no
said
trirodov
i
admit
that
but
in
my
opinion
aside
from
the
stupid
and
criminal
actions
of
these
or
other
individuals
there
are
more
general
causes
history
has
its
own
dialectic
whether
or
not
a
war
had
taken
place
is
all
the
same
there
would
have
been
a
fated
collision
in
any
case
in
one
or
another
form
there
would
have
begun
the
decisive
struggle
between
two
worlds
two
comprehensions
of
the
world
two
moralities
buddha
and
the
teachings
of
buddhism
resemble
those
of
christianity
considerably
said
piotr
that
is
its
only
yes
said
trirodov
there
appears
to
be
a
great
resemblance
at
the
first
glance
but
actually
these
two
systems
are
as
opposite
as
the
poles
they
are
the
affirmation
and
the
denial
of
life
its
yes
and
its
no
its
irony
and
its
lyricism
the
affirmation
yes
is
christianity
the
denial
no
is
that
seems
to
me
to
be
too
much
of
a
generalization
said
rameyev
trirodov
continued
i
generalize
for
the
sake
of
clearness
the
present
moment
in
history
is
especially
convenient
it
is
history
s
zenith
hour
now
that
christianity
has
revealed
the
eternal
contradiction
of
the
world
we
are
passing
through
the
poignant
struggle
of
those
two
world
and
not
the
struggle
of
the
classes
asked
rameyev
yes
said
trirodov
there
is
also
the
struggle
of
the
classes
to
whatever
degree
two
inimical
factors
enter
into
the
struggle
social
justice
and
the
real
relation
of
forces
a
common
morality
which
is
always
static
and
a
common
dynamism
the
christian
element
is
in
morality
the
buddhistic
in
dynamism
indeed
the
weakness
of
europe
consists
in
that
its
life
has
already
for
a
long
time
nourished
itself
on
a
substance
buddhistic
in
piotr
said
confidently
in
the
voice
of
a
young
prophet
in
this
duel
christianity
will
triumph
not
the
historic
christianity
of
course
and
not
the
present
but
the
christianity
of
john
and
the
apocalypse
and
it
will
triumph
only
then
when
everything
will
appear
lost
and
the
world
will
be
in
the
power
of
the
yellow
i
don
t
think
that
will
happen
said
trirodov
quietly
i
suppose
you
think
buddha
will
triumph
said
piotr
in
vexation
no
replied
trirodov
calmly
the
devil
perhaps
exclaimed
piotr
petya
exclaimed
rameyev
reproachfully
trirodov
lowered
his
head
slightly
as
if
he
were
confused
and
said
tranquilly
we
see
two
currents
equally
powerful
it
would
be
strange
that
either
one
of
them
should
conquer
that
is
impossible
it
is
impossible
to
destroy
half
of
the
whole
historical
however
said
piotr
if
neither
christ
nor
buddha
conquers
what
awaits
us
or
is
that
fool
guyau
right
when
he
speaks
of
the
irreligiousness
of
future
generations
there
will
be
a
synthesis
replied
trirodov
you
will
accept
it
for
the
this
contradictory
mixture
is
worse
than
forty
devils
exclaimed
piotr
the
visitors
soon
left
kirsha
came
without
being
called
confused
and
agitated
by
an
indefinable
something
he
was
silent
and
his
dark
eyes
flamed
with
sadness
and
fear
he
walked
up
to
the
window
looked
out
in
an
attitude
of
expectancy
he
seemed
to
see
something
in
the
distance
there
was
a
look
of
apprehension
in
his
dark
eyes
as
if
they
were
fixed
on
a
strange
distant
vision
thus
people
look
during
a
hallucination
kirsha
turned
to
his
father
and
growing
pale
said
quietly
father
a
visitor
has
come
to
you
from
quite
afar
how
strange
that
he
has
come
in
a
simple
carriage
and
in
ordinary
clothes
i
wonder
why
he
has
come
they
could
hear
the
crunching
sound
of
the
sand
under
the
iron
hoops
of
the
wheels
of
the
calash
which
had
just
entered
the
gates
kirsha
s
face
wore
a
gloomy
expression
it
was
difficult
to
comprehend
what
was
in
his
soul
was
it
a
reproach
astonishment
fear
trirodov
went
to
the
window
a
man
of
about
forty
impressive
for
his
appearance
of
calm
and
stepped
out
of
the
calash
trirodov
recognized
his
visitor
at
the
first
glance
though
he
had
never
met
him
before
in
society
he
knew
him
well
but
only
from
portraits
he
had
seen
of
him
from
his
literary
works
and
from
the
stories
of
his
admirers
and
articles
about
him
in
his
youth
trirodov
had
had
some
slight
relations
with
him
through
friends
but
this
was
interrupted
he
had
not
even
met
him
trirodov
suddenly
felt
both
cheerful
and
sad
he
reflected
why
has
he
come
to
me
what
does
he
want
of
me
and
why
should
he
suddenly
think
of
me
our
roads
have
diverged
so
much
we
have
become
such
strangers
to
one
there
was
his
disturbing
curiosity
i
ll
see
and
hear
him
for
the
first
and
the
mutinous
protest
his
words
are
a
lie
his
preachings
the
ravings
of
despair
there
was
no
miracle
there
is
none
and
there
will
not
be
kirsha
very
agitated
ran
out
of
the
room
the
sensitive
and
painful
feeling
of
aloneness
seized
trirodov
as
in
a
sticky
net
entangled
his
legs
and
obstructed
his
glances
with
grey
a
quiet
boy
entered
smiling
and
handed
him
a
card
on
which
under
a
princely
crown
was
the
lithographed
inscription
osipovitch
in
a
voice
dark
and
deep
with
suppressed
excitement
trirodov
said
to
the
boy
ask
him
to
come
the
provoking
and
unanswerable
question
persisted
in
his
mind
why
why
has
he
come
what
does
he
want
of
me
with
an
avidly
curious
glance
he
looked
at
the
door
and
did
not
take
his
eyes
away
he
heard
the
measured
unhastening
footsteps
nearer
and
nearer
as
if
his
fate
were
approaching
the
door
opened
admitting
the
visitor
prince
immanuel
osipovitch
davidov
celebrated
as
author
and
preacher
a
man
of
a
distinguished
family
and
democratic
views
a
man
beloved
of
many
and
possessed
of
the
mystery
of
extraordinary
fascination
attracting
to
him
many
hearts
his
face
was
very
smooth
quite
in
type
his
lips
slightly
descending
at
the
corners
were
marked
with
sorrow
his
beard
was
reddish
short
and
cut
to
a
point
his
slightly
wavy
hair
was
cut
quite
short
this
astonished
trirodov
who
had
always
seen
the
prince
in
portraits
wearing
his
hair
rather
long
like
the
poet
nadson
his
eyes
were
black
flaming
and
deep
deeply
hidden
in
his
eyes
was
an
expression
of
great
weariness
and
suffering
which
the
inattentive
observer
might
have
interpreted
as
an
expression
of
fatigued
tranquillity
and
indifference
everything
about
the
visitor
his
face
and
his
ways
betrayed
his
habit
of
speaking
in
a
large
company
even
in
a
crowd
he
walked
up
tranquilly
to
trirodov
and
said
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
i
wanted
to
see
you
i
have
observed
you
for
some
time
and
at
last
have
come
to
trirodov
making
an
effort
to
control
his
agitation
and
his
deep
irritation
said
with
an
affectedly
amiable
voice
i
m
very
pleased
to
greet
you
in
my
house
i
ve
heard
much
about
you
from
the
pirozhkovskys
of
course
you
know
that
they
have
a
great
admiration
and
affection
for
prince
davidov
looked
at
him
piercingly
but
calmly
perhaps
too
calmly
it
seemed
strange
that
he
answered
nothing
to
the
remark
about
the
pirozhkovskys
as
if
trirodov
s
words
passed
by
him
like
momentary
shadows
without
so
much
as
touching
anything
in
his
soul
on
the
other
hand
the
pirozhkovskys
have
always
talked
about
prince
davidov
as
of
an
intimate
acquaintance
yesterday
we
dined
at
the
prince
s
the
prince
is
finishing
a
new
poem
by
simply
the
prince
they
gave
one
to
understand
that
their
remark
concerned
their
friend
prince
davidov
trirodov
recalled
that
the
prince
had
many
acquaintances
and
that
there
were
always
large
gatherings
in
his
house
permit
me
to
offer
you
some
refreshment
said
trirodov
will
you
have
wine
i
d
rather
have
tea
if
you
don
t
mind
said
prince
davidov
trirodov
pressed
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
prince
davidov
continued
in
his
tranquil
too
tranquil
voice
my
fianc√©e
lives
in
this
town
i
ve
come
to
see
her
and
have
taken
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
have
a
chat
with
you
there
are
many
things
i
should
like
to
discuss
with
you
but
i
shall
not
have
the
time
we
must
limit
ourselves
to
the
more
important
and
he
began
to
talk
and
did
not
wait
for
answers
or
refutations
his
flaming
speech
poured
itself
out
about
faith
miracles
about
the
likely
and
inevitable
transfiguration
of
the
world
by
means
of
a
miracle
about
our
triumph
over
the
fetters
of
time
and
over
death
itself
the
quiet
boy
grisha
brought
tea
and
cakes
and
with
measured
movements
put
them
on
the
table
pausing
now
and
then
to
look
at
the
visitor
with
his
blue
quiet
eyes
prince
davidov
looked
reproachfully
at
trirodov
a
repressed
smile
trembled
on
trirodov
s
lips
and
an
obstinate
challenge
gleamed
in
his
eyes
the
visitor
affectionately
drew
grisha
to
him
and
stroked
him
gently
the
quiet
boy
stood
calmly
there
and
trirodov
was
gloomy
he
said
to
his
visitor
you
love
children
i
can
understand
that
they
are
angelic
beings
though
unbearable
sometimes
it
is
only
a
pity
that
they
die
too
often
upon
this
accursed
earth
they
are
born
in
order
to
prince
davidov
with
a
tranquil
movement
pushed
grisha
away
from
him
he
put
his
hand
on
the
boy
s
head
as
if
in
blessing
then
suddenly
became
grave
and
stern
and
asked
quietly
why
do
you
do
this
he
asked
the
question
with
a
great
exertion
of
the
will
like
one
who
wished
to
exercise
power
trirodov
smiled
you
do
not
like
it
he
asked
well
what
of
it
you
with
your
extensive
connexions
could
easily
hinder
the
tone
in
which
he
uttered
his
words
expressed
proud
irony
thus
satan
would
have
spoken
tempting
a
famished
one
in
the
desert
prince
davidov
frowned
his
black
eyes
flared
up
he
asked
again
why
have
you
done
all
this
the
body
of
the
malefactor
and
the
soul
of
an
innocent
why
should
you
have
it
all
trirodov
looking
angrily
at
his
visitor
said
resolutely
my
design
has
been
daring
and
difficult
but
have
i
alone
suffered
from
despondency
suffered
until
i
perspired
with
blood
do
i
alone
bear
within
me
a
dual
soul
and
unite
in
me
two
worlds
am
i
alone
worn
out
by
nightmares
as
heavy
as
the
burdens
of
the
world
have
i
alone
in
a
tragic
moment
felt
myself
lonely
and
forsaken
the
visitor
smiled
a
strange
sad
tranquil
smile
trirodov
continued
you
had
better
know
that
i
will
never
be
with
you
that
i
will
not
accept
your
comforting
theories
all
your
literary
and
preaching
activity
is
a
complete
mistake
i
don
t
believe
anything
of
what
you
say
so
eloquently
enticing
the
weak
i
simply
don
t
believe
the
visitor
was
silent
leave
me
alone
said
trirodov
decisively
there
is
no
miracle
there
was
no
resurrection
no
one
has
conquered
death
the
establishment
of
a
single
will
over
the
inert
amorphous
world
is
a
deed
not
yet
prince
davidov
rose
and
said
sorrowfully
i
will
leave
you
alone
if
you
wish
it
but
you
will
regret
that
you
have
rejected
the
path
i
have
shown
you
the
only
trirodov
said
proudly
i
know
the
true
path
my
said
prince
davidov
simply
and
calmly
he
left
and
in
a
little
while
it
seemed
that
he
had
not
been
there
lost
in
painful
reflections
trirodov
did
not
hear
the
noise
of
the
departing
carriage
the
unexpected
call
of
the
fascinating
visitor
with
his
flaming
speech
and
his
fiery
eyes
stirred
his
memory
like
a
midday
dream
like
an
abrupt
hallucination
who
is
his
fianc√©e
and
why
is
she
here
trirodov
asked
himself
a
strange
impossible
idea
came
into
his
head
did
not
elisaveta
once
speak
about
him
with
rapture
perhaps
the
unexpected
visitor
would
take
elisaveta
away
from
him
as
he
had
taken
her
from
piotr
this
misgiving
tormented
him
but
trirodov
looked
into
the
clearness
of
her
eyes
on
the
portrait
taken
recently
and
at
the
grace
and
loveliness
of
her
body
and
suddenly
consoled
himself
he
thought
she
is
but
elisaveta
musing
and
burning
was
experiencing
passionate
dreams
and
she
felt
the
tediousness
of
the
grey
monotony
of
her
dull
life
the
strange
vision
suddenly
appearing
to
her
in
those
terrible
moments
in
the
wood
repeated
itself
persistently
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
not
another
but
she
herself
who
was
experiencing
a
parallel
life
that
she
was
passing
the
exultantly
bright
joyous
and
sad
way
of
