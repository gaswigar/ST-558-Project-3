an
unprotected
female
at
the
pyramids
in
the
happy
days
when
we
were
young
no
description
conveyed
to
us
so
complete
an
idea
of
mysterious
reality
as
that
of
an
oriental
city
we
knew
it
was
actually
there
but
had
such
vague
notions
of
its
ways
and
looks
let
any
one
remember
his
early
impressions
as
to
bagdad
or
grand
cairo
and
then
say
if
this
was
not
so
it
was
probably
taken
from
the
arabian
nights
and
the
picture
produced
was
one
of
strange
fantastic
luxurious
houses
of
women
who
were
either
very
young
and
very
beautiful
or
else
very
old
and
very
cunning
but
in
either
state
exercising
much
more
influence
in
life
than
women
in
the
east
do
now
of
capricious
though
sometimes
tyrannical
monarchs
and
of
life
full
of
quaint
mysteries
quite
unintelligible
in
every
phasis
and
on
that
account
the
more
picturesque
and
perhaps
grand
cairo
has
thus
filled
us
with
more
wonder
even
than
bagdad
we
have
been
in
a
certain
manner
at
home
at
bagdad
but
have
only
visited
grand
cairo
occasionally
i
know
no
place
which
was
to
me
in
early
years
so
delightfully
mysterious
as
grand
cairo
but
the
route
to
india
and
australia
has
changed
all
this
men
from
all
countries
going
to
the
east
now
pass
through
cairo
and
its
streets
and
costumes
are
no
longer
strange
to
us
it
has
become
also
a
resort
for
invalids
or
rather
for
those
who
fear
that
they
may
become
invalids
if
they
remain
in
a
cold
climate
during
the
winter
months
and
thus
at
cairo
there
is
always
to
be
found
a
considerable
population
of
french
americans
and
of
english
oriental
life
is
brought
home
to
us
dreadfully
diluted
by
western
customs
and
the
delights
of
the
arabian
nights
are
shorn
of
half
their
value
when
we
have
seen
a
thing
it
is
never
so
magnificent
to
us
as
when
it
was
half
unknown
it
is
not
much
that
we
deign
to
learn
from
these
orientals
who
glory
in
our
civilisation
we
do
not
copy
their
silence
or
their
abstemiousness
nor
that
invariable
mindfulness
of
his
own
personal
dignity
which
always
adheres
to
a
turk
or
to
an
arab
we
chatter
as
much
at
cairo
as
elsewhere
and
eat
as
much
and
drink
as
much
and
dress
ourselves
generally
in
the
same
old
ugly
costume
but
we
do
usually
take
upon
ourselves
to
wear
red
caps
and
we
do
ride
on
donkeys
nor
are
the
visitors
from
the
west
to
cairo
by
any
means
confined
to
the
male
sex
ladies
are
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
quite
regardless
of
the
mahommedan
custom
which
presumes
a
veil
to
be
necessary
for
an
appearance
in
public
and
to
tell
the
truth
the
mahommedans
in
general
do
not
appear
to
be
much
shocked
by
their
effrontery
a
quarter
of
the
town
has
in
this
way
become
inhabited
by
men
wearing
coats
and
waistcoats
and
by
women
who
are
without
veils
but
the
english
tongue
in
egypt
finds
its
centre
at
shepheard
s
hotel
it
is
here
that
people
congregate
who
are
looking
out
for
parties
to
visit
with
them
the
upper
nile
and
who
are
generally
all
smiles
and
courtesy
and
here
also
are
to
be
found
they
who
have
just
returned
from
this
journey
and
who
are
often
in
a
frame
of
mind
towards
their
companions
that
is
much
less
amiable
from
hence
during
the
winter
a
cortége
proceeds
almost
daily
to
the
pyramids
or
to
memphis
or
to
the
petrified
forest
or
to
the
city
of
the
sun
and
then
again
four
or
five
times
a
month
the
house
is
filled
with
young
aspirants
going
out
to
india
male
and
female
full
of
valour
and
bloom
or
with
others
coming
home
no
longer
young
no
longer
aspiring
but
laden
with
children
and
grievances
the
party
with
whom
we
are
at
present
concerned
is
not
about
to
proceed
further
than
the
pyramids
and
we
shall
be
able
to
go
with
them
and
return
in
one
and
the
same
day
it
consisted
chiefly
of
an
english
family
and
damer
their
daughter
and
two
young
sons
these
chiefly
because
they
were
the
nucleus
to
which
the
others
had
attached
themselves
as
adherents
they
had
originated
the
journey
and
in
the
whole
management
of
it
damer
regarded
himself
as
the
master
the
adherents
were
firstly
delabordeau
a
frenchman
now
resident
in
cairo
who
had
given
out
that
he
was
in
some
way
concerned
in
the
canal
about
to
be
made
between
the
mediterranean
and
the
red
sea
in
discussion
on
this
subject
he
had
become
acquainted
with
damer
and
although
the
latter
gentleman
true
to
english
interests
perpetually
declared
that
the
canal
would
never
be
made
and
thus
irritated
delabordeau
not
a
some
measure
of
friendship
had
grown
up
between
them
there
was
also
an
american
gentleman
jefferson
ingram
who
was
comprising
all
countries
and
all
nations
in
one
grand
tour
as
american
gentlemen
so
often
do
he
was
young
and
and
had
made
himself
especially
agreeable
to
damer
who
had
declared
more
than
once
that
ingram
was
by
far
the
most
rational
american
he
had
ever
met
ingram
would
listen
to
damer
by
the
as
to
the
virtue
of
the
british
constitution
and
had
even
sat
by
almost
with
patience
when
damer
had
expressed
a
doubt
as
to
the
good
working
of
the
united
states
scheme
of
policy
in
an
american
was
most
wonderful
but
some
of
the
sojourners
at
shepheard
s
had
observed
that
ingram
was
in
the
habit
of
talking
with
miss
damer
almost
as
much
as
with
her
father
and
argued
from
that
that
fond
as
the
young
man
was
of
politics
he
did
sometimes
turn
his
mind
to
other
things
also
and
then
there
was
miss
dawkins
now
miss
dawkins
was
an
important
person
both
as
to
herself
and
as
to
her
line
of
life
and
she
must
be
described
she
was
in
the
first
place
an
unprotected
female
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
as
this
is
becoming
an
established
profession
setting
itself
up
as
it
were
in
opposition
to
the
old
world
idea
that
women
like
green
peas
can
not
come
to
perfection
without
it
will
be
understood
at
once
what
were
miss
dawkins
s
sentiments
she
at
any
rate
so
expressed
peas
could
grow
very
well
without
sticks
and
could
not
only
grow
thus
unsupported
but
could
also
make
their
way
about
the
world
without
any
incumbrance
of
sticks
whatsoever
she
did
not
intend
she
said
to
rival
ida
pfeiffer
seeing
that
she
was
attached
in
a
moderate
way
to
bed
and
board
and
was
attached
to
society
in
a
manner
almost
more
than
moderate
but
she
had
no
idea
of
being
prevented
from
seeing
anything
she
wished
to
see
because
she
had
neither
father
nor
husband
nor
brother
available
for
the
purpose
of
escort
she
was
a
human
creature
with
arms
and
legs
she
said
and
she
intended
to
use
them
and
this
was
all
very
well
but
nevertheless
she
had
a
strong
inclination
to
use
the
arms
and
legs
of
other
people
when
she
could
make
them
serviceable
in
person
miss
dawkins
was
not
without
attraction
i
should
exaggerate
if
i
were
to
say
that
she
was
beautiful
and
elegant
but
she
was
good
looking
and
not
usually
ill
mannered
she
was
tall
and
gifted
with
features
rather
sharp
and
with
eyes
very
bright
her
hair
was
of
the
darkest
shade
of
brown
and
was
always
worn
in
bandeaux
very
neatly
she
appeared
generally
in
black
though
other
circumstances
did
not
lead
one
to
suppose
that
she
was
in
mourning
and
then
no
other
travelling
costume
is
so
convenient
she
always
wore
a
dark
straw
hat
as
to
the
ribbons
on
which
she
was
rather
particular
she
was
very
neat
about
her
gloves
and
boots
and
though
it
can
not
be
said
that
her
dress
was
got
up
without
reference
to
expense
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
was
not
effected
without
considerable
outlay
more
considerable
thought
miss
dawkins
was
her
name
but
she
seldom
had
friends
about
her
intimate
enough
to
use
the
word
certainly
a
clever
young
woman
she
could
talk
on
most
subjects
if
not
well
at
least
well
enough
to
amuse
if
she
had
not
read
much
she
never
showed
any
lamentable
deficiency
she
was
as
a
rule
and
could
on
occasions
be
very
soft
and
winning
people
who
had
known
her
long
would
sometimes
say
that
she
was
selfish
but
with
new
acquaintance
she
was
forbearing
and
with
what
income
miss
dawkins
was
blessed
no
one
seemed
to
know
she
lived
like
a
gentlewoman
as
far
as
outward
appearance
went
and
never
seemed
to
be
in
want
but
some
people
would
say
that
she
knew
very
well
how
many
sides
there
were
to
a
shilling
and
some
enemy
had
once
declared
that
she
was
an
old
such
was
miss
dawkins
she
also
as
well
as
ingram
and
delabordeau
had
laid
herself
out
to
find
the
weak
side
of
damer
damer
with
all
his
family
was
going
up
the
nile
and
it
was
known
that
he
had
room
for
two
in
his
boat
over
and
above
his
own
family
miss
dawkins
had
told
him
that
she
had
not
quite
made
up
her
mind
to
undergo
so
great
a
fatigue
but
that
nevertheless
she
had
a
longing
of
the
soul
to
see
something
of
nubia
to
this
damer
had
answered
nothing
but
oh
which
miss
dawkins
had
not
found
to
be
encouraging
but
she
had
not
on
that
account
despaired
to
a
married
man
there
are
always
two
sides
and
in
this
instance
there
was
damer
as
well
as
damer
when
damer
said
oh
miss
dawkins
sighed
and
said
yes
indeed
then
smiled
and
betook
herself
to
damer
now
damer
was
and
also
somewhat
she
did
not
conceive
any
violent
affection
for
miss
dawkins
but
she
told
her
daughter
that
the
single
lady
by
herself
was
a
very
nice
young
woman
and
that
it
was
a
thousand
pities
she
should
have
to
go
about
so
much
alone
miss
damer
had
turned
up
her
pretty
nose
thinking
perhaps
how
small
was
the
chance
that
it
ever
should
be
her
own
lot
to
be
an
unprotected
female
but
miss
dawkins
carried
her
point
at
any
rate
as
regarded
the
expedition
to
the
pyramids
miss
damer
i
have
said
had
a
pretty
nose
i
may
also
say
that
she
had
pretty
eyes
mouth
and
chin
with
other
necessary
appendages
all
pretty
as
to
the
two
master
damers
who
were
respectively
of
the
ages
of
fifteen
and
sixteen
it
may
be
sufficient
to
say
that
they
were
conspicuous
for
red
caps
and
for
the
constancy
with
which
they
raced
their
donkeys
and
now
the
donkeys
and
the
donkey
boys
and
the
dragomans
were
all
standing
at
the
steps
of
shepheard
s
hotel
to
each
donkey
there
was
a
and
to
each
gentleman
there
was
a
dragoman
so
that
a
goodly
cortége
was
assembled
and
a
goodly
noise
was
made
it
may
here
be
remarked
perhaps
with
some
little
pride
that
not
half
the
noise
is
given
in
egypt
to
persons
speaking
any
other
language
that
is
bestowed
on
those
whose
vocabulary
is
english
this
lasted
for
half
an
hour
had
the
party
been
french
the
donkeys
would
have
arrived
only
fifteen
minutes
before
the
appointed
time
and
then
out
came
damer
père
and
damer
mère
damer
fille
and
damer
fils
damer
mère
was
leaning
on
her
husband
as
was
her
wont
she
was
not
an
unprotected
female
and
had
no
desire
to
make
any
attempts
in
that
line
damer
fille
was
attended
sedulously
by
ingram
for
whose
demolishment
however
damer
still
brought
up
in
a
loud
voice
the
fag
ends
of
certain
political
arguments
which
he
would
fain
have
poured
direct
into
the
ears
of
his
opponent
had
not
his
wife
been
so
persistent
in
claiming
her
privileges
delabordeau
should
have
followed
with
miss
dawkins
but
his
french
politeness
or
else
his
fear
of
the
unprotected
female
taught
him
to
walk
on
the
other
side
of
the
mistress
of
the
party
miss
dawkins
left
the
house
with
an
eager
young
damer
yelling
on
each
side
of
her
but
nevertheless
though
thus
neglected
by
the
gentlemen
of
the
party
she
was
all
smiles
and
prettiness
and
looked
so
sweetly
on
ingram
when
that
gentleman
stayed
a
moment
to
help
her
on
to
her
donkey
that
his
heart
almost
misgave
him
for
leaving
her
as
soon
as
she
was
in
her
seat
and
then
they
were
off
in
going
from
the
hotel
to
the
pyramids
our
party
had
not
to
pass
through
any
of
the
queer
old
narrow
streets
of
the
true
the
oriental
they
all
lay
behind
them
as
they
went
down
by
the
back
of
the
hotel
by
the
barracks
of
the
pasha
and
the
college
of
the
dervishes
to
the
village
of
old
cairo
and
the
banks
of
the
nile
here
they
were
kept
half
an
hour
while
their
dragomans
made
a
bargain
with
the
ferryman
a
stately
reis
or
captain
of
a
boat
who
declared
with
much
dignity
that
he
could
not
carry
them
over
for
a
sum
less
than
six
times
the
amount
to
which
he
was
justly
entitled
while
the
dragomans
with
great
energy
on
behalf
of
their
masters
offered
him
only
five
times
that
sum
as
far
as
the
reis
was
concerned
the
contest
might
soon
have
been
at
an
end
for
the
man
was
not
without
a
conscience
and
would
have
been
content
with
five
times
and
a
half
but
then
the
three
dragomans
quarrelled
among
themselves
as
to
which
should
have
the
paying
of
the
money
and
the
affair
became
very
tedious
what
horrid
odious
men
said
miss
dawkins
appealing
to
damer
do
you
think
they
will
let
us
go
over
at
all
well
i
suppose
they
will
people
do
get
over
generally
i
believe
abdallah
abdallah
why
don
t
you
pay
the
man
that
fellow
is
always
striving
to
save
half
a
piastre
for
i
wish
he
wasn
t
quite
so
particular
said
damer
who
was
already
becoming
rather
tired
but
i
m
sure
he
s
a
very
honest
man
in
trying
to
protect
us
from
being
that
he
is
said
miss
dawkins
what
a
delightful
trait
of
national
character
it
is
to
see
these
men
so
faithful
to
their
and
then
at
last
they
got
over
the
ferry
ingram
having
descended
among
the
combatants
and
settled
the
matter
in
dispute
by
threats
and
shouts
and
an
uplifted
stick
they
crossed
the
broad
nile
exactly
at
the
spot
where
the
nilometer
or
river
guage
measures
from
day
to
day
and
from
year
to
year
the
increasing
or
decreasing
treasures
of
the
stream
and
landed
at
a
village
where
thousands
of
eggs
are
made
into
chickens
by
the
process
of
artificial
incubation
damer
thought
that
it
was
very
hard
upon
the
maternal
hens
which
should
have
been
they
should
be
thus
robbed
of
the
delights
of
motherhood
so
unnatural
you
know
said
miss
dawkins
so
opposed
to
the
fostering
principles
of
creation
don
t
you
think
so
ingram
ingram
said
he
didn
t
know
he
was
again
seating
miss
damer
on
her
donkey
and
it
must
be
presumed
that
he
performed
this
feat
clumsily
for
fanny
damer
could
jump
on
and
off
the
animal
with
hardly
a
finger
to
help
her
when
her
brother
or
her
father
was
her
escort
but
now
under
the
hands
of
ingram
this
work
of
mounting
was
one
which
required
considerable
time
and
care
all
which
miss
dawkins
observed
with
precision
it
s
all
very
well
talking
said
damer
bringing
up
his
donkey
nearly
alongside
that
of
ingram
and
ignoring
his
daughter
s
presence
just
as
he
would
have
done
that
of
his
dog
but
you
must
admit
that
political
power
is
more
equally
distributed
in
england
than
it
is
in
perhaps
it
is
said
ingram
equally
distributed
among
we
will
say
three
dozen
families
and
he
made
a
feint
as
though
to
hold
in
his
impetuous
donkey
using
the
spur
however
at
the
same
time
on
the
side
that
was
unseen
by
damer
as
he
did
so
fanny
s
donkey
became
equally
impetuous
and
the
two
cantered
on
in
advance
of
the
whole
party
it
was
quite
in
vain
that
damer
at
the
top
of
his
voice
shouted
out
something
about
three
dozen
corruptible
ingram
found
it
quite
impossible
to
restrain
his
donkey
so
as
to
listen
to
the
sarcasm
i
do
believe
papa
would
talk
politics
said
fanny
if
he
were
at
the
top
of
mont
blanc
or
under
the
falls
of
niagara
i
do
hate
politics
i
am
sorry
for
that
very
said
ingram
almost
sadly
sorry
why
you
don
t
want
me
to
talk
politics
do
you
in
america
we
are
all
politicians
more
or
less
and
therefore
i
suppose
you
will
hate
us
well
i
rather
think
i
should
said
fanny
you
would
be
such
but
there
was
something
in
her
eye
as
she
spoke
which
atoned
for
the
harshness
of
her
words
a
very
nice
young
man
is
ingram
don
t
you
think
so
said
miss
dawkins
to
damer
damer
was
going
along
upon
her
donkey
not
altogether
comfortably
she
much
wished
to
have
her
lord
and
legitimate
protector
by
her
side
but
he
had
left
her
to
the
care
of
a
dragoman
whose
english
was
not
intelligible
to
her
and
she
was
rather
cross
indeed
miss
dawkins
i
don
t
know
who
are
nice
and
who
are
not
this
nasty
donkey
stumbles
at
ever
step
there
i
know
i
shall
be
down
you
need
not
be
at
all
afraid
of
that
they
are
perfectly
safe
i
believe
always
said
miss
dawkins
rising
in
her
stirrup
and
handling
her
reins
quite
triumphantly
a
very
little
practice
will
make
you
quite
at
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
a
very
little
practice
i
have
been
here
six
weeks
why
did
you
put
me
on
such
a
bad
donkey
as
this
and
she
turned
to
abdallah
the
dragoman
him
berry
good
donkey
my
lady
berry
good
of
all
call
him
jack
in
cairo
him
go
to
pyramid
and
back
and
mind
what
does
he
say
miss
dawkins
he
says
that
that
donkey
is
one
called
jack
if
so
i
ve
had
him
myself
many
times
and
jack
is
a
very
good
i
wish
you
had
him
now
with
all
my
heart
said
damer
upon
which
miss
dawkins
offered
to
change
but
those
perils
of
mounting
and
dismounting
were
to
damer
a
great
deal
too
severe
to
admit
of
this
seven
miles
of
canal
to
be
carried
out
into
the
sea
at
a
minimum
depth
of
feet
and
the
stone
to
be
fetched
from
heaven
knows
where
all
the
money
in
france
wouldn
t
do
this
was
addressed
by
damer
to
delabordeau
whom
he
had
caught
after
the
abrupt
flight
of
ingram
den
we
will
borrow
a
leetle
from
england
said
delabordeau
precious
little
i
can
tell
you
such
stock
would
not
hold
its
price
in
our
markets
for
hours
if
it
were
made
the
freights
would
be
too
heavy
to
allow
of
merchandise
passing
through
the
heavy
goods
would
all
go
round
and
as
for
passengers
and
mails
you
don
t
expect
to
get
them
i
suppose
while
there
is
a
railroad
ready
made
to
their
hand
ye
vill
carry
all
your
ships
through
vidout
any
transportation
think
of
that
my
pshaw
you
are
worse
than
ingram
of
all
the
plans
i
ever
heard
of
it
is
the
most
monstrous
the
most
impracticable
the
but
here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
entreaties
of
his
wife
who
had
in
absolute
deed
and
fact
slipped
from
her
donkey
and
was
now
calling
lustily
for
her
husband
s
aid
whereupon
miss
dawkins
allied
herself
to
the
frenchman
and
listened
with
an
air
of
strong
conviction
to
those
arguments
which
were
so
weak
in
the
ears
of
damer
delabordeau
was
about
to
ride
across
the
great
desert
to
jerusalem
and
it
might
perhaps
be
quite
as
well
to
do
that
with
him
as
to
go
up
the
nile
as
far
as
the
second
cataract
with
the
damers
and
so
delabordeau
you
intend
really
to
start
for
mount
sinai
yes
mees
ve
intend
to
make
one
start
on
monday
and
so
on
to
jerusalem
you
are
quite
right
it
would
be
a
thousand
pities
to
be
in
these
countries
and
to
return
without
going
over
such
ground
as
that
i
shall
certainly
go
to
jerusalem
myself
by
that
vot
mees
you
would
you
not
find
it
too
much
fatigante
i
care
nothing
for
fatigue
if
i
like
the
party
i
am
with
at
all
literally
you
will
hardly
understand
me
perhaps
delabordeau
but
i
do
not
see
any
reason
why
i
as
a
young
woman
should
not
make
any
journey
that
is
practicable
for
a
young
ah
dat
is
great
resolution
for
you
i
mean
as
far
as
fatigue
is
concerned
you
are
a
frenchman
and
belong
to
the
nation
that
is
at
the
head
of
all
human
delabordeau
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
low
to
the
peak
of
his
donkey
saddle
he
dearly
loved
to
hear
his
country
praised
as
miss
dawkins
was
aware
and
i
am
sure
you
must
agree
with
me
continued
miss
dawkins
that
the
time
is
gone
by
for
women
to
consider
themselves
helpless
animals
or
to
be
so
considered
by
mees
dawkins
vould
never
be
considered
not
in
any
times
at
all
to
be
one
helpless
animal
said
delabordeau
civilly
i
do
not
at
any
rate
intend
to
be
so
regarded
said
she
it
suits
me
to
travel
alone
not
that
i
am
averse
to
society
quite
the
contrary
if
i
meet
pleasant
people
i
am
always
ready
to
join
them
but
it
suits
me
to
travel
without
any
permanent
party
and
i
do
not
see
why
false
shame
should
prevent
my
seeing
the
world
as
thoroughly
as
though
i
belonged
to
the
other
sex
why
should
it
delabordeau
delabordeau
declared
that
he
did
not
see
any
reason
why
it
should
i
am
passionately
anxious
to
stand
upon
mount
sinai
continued
miss
dawkins
to
press
with
my
feet
the
earliest
spot
in
sacred
history
of
the
identity
of
which
we
are
certain
to
feel
within
me
the
thrill
of
that
thrice
sacred
hour
the
frenchman
looked
as
though
he
did
not
quite
understand
her
but
he
said
that
it
would
be
magnifique
you
have
already
made
up
your
party
i
suppose
delabordeau
delabordeau
gave
the
names
of
two
frenchmen
and
one
englishman
who
were
going
with
him
upon
my
word
it
is
a
great
temptation
to
join
you
said
miss
dawkins
only
for
that
horrid
vat
stanley
oh
i
don
t
mean
any
disrespect
to
stanley
the
horridness
i
speak
of
does
not
attach
to
him
personally
but
to
his
stiff
respectable
ungainly
irrational
and
uncivilised
country
you
see
i
am
not
very
not
quite
so
much
as
my
friend
ha
ha
ha
an
excellent
creature
isn
t
he
and
so
they
all
are
dear
creatures
but
then
they
are
so
backward
they
are
most
anxious
that
i
should
join
them
up
the
nile
and
then
miss
dawkins
shrugged
her
shoulders
gracefully
and
as
she
flattered
herself
like
a
frenchwoman
after
that
they
rode
on
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
yes
i
must
see
mount
sinai
said
miss
dawkins
and
then
sighed
deeply
delabordeau
notwithstanding
that
his
country
does
stand
at
the
head
of
all
human
civilisation
was
not
courteous
enough
to
declare
that
if
miss
dawkins
would
join
his
party
across
the
desert
nothing
would
be
wanting
to
make
his
beatitude
in
this
world
perfect
their
road
from
the
village
of
the
ovens
lay
up
along
the
left
bank
of
the
nile
through
an
immense
grove
of
lofty
looking
out
from
among
which
our
visitors
could
ever
and
anon
see
the
heads
of
the
two
great
pyramids
is
such
of
them
could
see
it
as
felt
any
solicitude
in
the
matter
it
is
astonishing
how
such
things
lose
their
great
charm
as
men
find
themselves
in
their
close
neighbourhood
to
one
living
in
new
york
or
london
how
ecstatic
is
the
interest
inspired
by
these
huge
structures
one
feels
that
no
price
would
be
too
high
to
pay
for
seeing
them
as
long
as
time
and
distance
and
the
world
s
inexorable
forbid
such
a
visit
how
intense
would
be
the
delight
of
climbing
over
the
wondrous
handiwork
of
those
wondrous
architects
so
long
since
dead
how
thrilling
the
awe
with
which
one
would
penetrate
down
into
their
interior
caves
in
which
lay
buried
the
bones
of
ancient
kings
whose
very
names
seem
to
have
come
to
us
almost
from
another
world
but
all
these
feelings
become
strangely
dim
their
acute
edges
wonderfully
worn
as
the
subjects
which
inspired
them
are
brought
near
to
us
ah
so
those
are
the
pyramids
are
they
says
the
traveller
when
the
first
glimpse
of
them
is
shown
to
him
from
the
window
of
a
railway
carriage
dear
me
they
don
t
look
so
very
high
do
they
for
heaven
s
sake
put
the
blind
down
or
we
shall
be
destroyed
by
the
and
then
the
ecstasy
and
keen
delight
of
the
pyramids
has
vanished
for
ever
our
friends
therefore
who
for
weeks
past
had
seen
from
a
distance
though
they
had
not
yet
visited
them
did
not
seem
to
have
any
strong
feeling
on
the
subject
as
they
trotted
through
the
grove
of
damer
had
not
yet
escaped
from
his
wife
who
was
still
fretful
from
the
result
of
her
little
accident
it
was
all
the
chattering
of
that
miss
dawkins
said
damer
she
would
not
let
me
attend
to
what
i
was
miss
dawkins
is
an
ass
said
her
husband
it
is
a
pity
she
has
no
one
to
look
after
her
said
damer
delabordeau
was
still
listening
to
miss
dawkins
s
raptures
about
mount
sinai
i
wonder
whether
she
has
got
any
money
said
delabordeau
to
himself
it
can
t
be
much
he
went
on
thinking
or
she
would
not
be
left
in
this
way
by
and
the
result
of
his
thoughts
was
that
miss
dawkins
if
undertaken
might
probably
become
more
plague
than
profit
as
to
miss
dawkins
herself
though
she
was
ecstatic
about
mount
was
not
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
poor
pyramids
which
were
then
before
her
nose
the
two
lads
were
riding
races
along
the
dusty
path
much
to
the
disgust
of
their
their
time
for
enjoyment
was
to
come
there
were
hampers
to
be
opened
and
then
the
absolute
climbing
of
the
pyramids
would
actually
be
a
delight
to
them
as
for
miss
damer
and
ingram
it
was
clear
that
they
had
forgotten
pyramids
the
nile
and
all
egypt
they
had
escaped
to
a
much
fairer
paradise
could
i
bear
to
live
among
republicans
said
fanny
repeating
the
last
words
of
her
american
lover
and
looking
down
from
her
donkey
to
the
ground
as
she
did
so
i
hardly
know
what
republicans
are
let
me
teach
you
said
he
you
do
talk
such
nonsense
i
declare
there
is
that
miss
dawkins
looking
at
us
as
though
she
had
twenty
eyes
could
you
not
teach
her
ingram
and
so
they
emerged
from
the
grove
through
a
village
crowded
with
dirty
straggling
arab
children
on
to
the
cultivated
plain
beyond
which
the
pyramids
stood
now
full
before
them
the
two
large
pyramids
a
smaller
one
and
the
huge
sphynx
s
head
all
in
a
group
together
fanny
said
bob
damer
riding
up
to
her
mamma
wants
you
so
toddle
mamma
wants
me
what
can
she
want
me
for
now
said
fanny
with
a
look
of
anything
but
filial
duty
in
her
face
to
protect
her
from
miss
dawkins
i
think
she
wants
you
to
ride
at
her
side
so
that
dawkins
mayn
t
get
at
her
now
ingram
i
ll
bet
you
i
m
at
the
top
of
the
big
pyramid
before
poor
fanny
she
obeyed
however
doubtless
feeling
that
it
would
not
do
as
yet
to
show
too
plainly
that
she
preferred
ingram
to
her
mother
she
arrested
her
donkey
therefore
till
damer
overtook
her
and
ingram
as
he
paused
for
a
moment
with
her
while
she
did
so
fell
into
the
hands
of
miss
dawkins
i
can
not
think
fanny
how
you
get
on
so
quick
said
damer
i
m
always
last
but
then
my
donkey
is
such
a
very
nasty
one
look
there
now
he
s
always
trying
to
get
me
we
shall
soon
be
at
the
pyramids
now
how
on
earth
i
am
ever
to
get
back
again
i
can
not
think
i
am
so
tired
now
that
i
can
hardly
you
ll
be
better
mamma
when
you
get
your
luncheon
and
a
glass
of
how
on
earth
we
are
to
eat
and
drink
with
those
nasty
arab
people
around
us
i
can
t
conceive
they
tell
me
we
shall
be
eaten
up
by
them
but
fanny
what
has
ingram
been
saying
to
you
all
the
day
what
has
he
been
saying
mamma
oh
i
don
t
know
hundred
things
i
dare
say
but
he
has
not
been
talking
to
me
all
the
i
think
he
has
fanny
nearly
since
we
crossed
the
river
oh
dear
oh
dear
this
animal
does
hurt
me
so
every
time
he
moves
he
flings
his
head
about
and
that
gives
me
such
a
and
then
fanny
commiserated
her
mother
s
sufferings
and
in
her
commiseration
contrived
to
elude
any
further
questionings
as
to
ingram
s
conversation
majestic
piles
are
they
not
said
miss
dawkins
who
having
changed
her
companion
allowed
her
mind
to
revert
from
mount
sinai
to
the
pyramids
they
were
now
riding
through
cultivated
ground
with
the
vast
extent
of
the
sands
of
libya
before
them
the
two
pyramids
were
standing
on
the
margin
of
the
sand
with
the
head
of
the
recumbent
sphynx
plainly
visible
between
them
but
no
idea
can
be
formed
of
the
size
of
this
immense
figure
till
it
is
visited
much
more
closely
the
body
is
covered
with
sand
and
the
head
and
neck
alone
stand
above
the
surface
of
the
ground
they
were
still
two
miles
distant
and
the
sphynx
as
yet
was
but
an
obscure
mount
between
the
two
vast
pyramids
immense
piles
said
miss
dawkins
repeating
her
own
words
yes
they
are
large
said
ingram
who
did
not
choose
to
indulge
in
enthusiasm
in
the
presence
of
miss
dawkins
enormous
what
a
grand
idea
ingram
the
human
race
does
not
create
such
things
as
those
nowadays
no
indeed
he
answered
but
perhaps
we
create
better
better
you
do
not
mean
to
say
ingram
that
you
are
an
utilitarian
i
do
in
truth
hope
better
things
of
you
than
that
yes
steam
mills
are
better
no
doubt
and
mechanics
institutes
and
penny
newspapers
but
is
nothing
to
be
valued
but
what
is
useful
and
miss
dawkins
in
the
height
of
her
enthusiasm
switched
her
donkey
severely
over
the
shoulder
i
might
perhaps
have
said
also
that
we
create
more
beautiful
things
said
ingram
but
we
can
not
create
older
no
certainly
we
can
not
do
nor
can
we
imbue
what
we
do
create
with
the
grand
associations
which
environ
those
piles
with
so
intense
an
interest
think
of
the
mighty
dead
ingram
and
of
their
great
homes
when
living
think
of
the
hands
which
it
took
to
raise
those
huge
and
of
the
lives
which
it
doubtless
the
tyranny
and
invincible
power
of
the
royal
architects
add
to
the
grandeur
of
the
idea
one
would
not
wish
to
have
back
the
kings
of
well
no
they
would
be
neither
useful
nor
perhaps
not
and
i
do
not
wish
to
be
picturesque
at
the
expense
of
my
i
doubt
even
whether
they
would
be
you
know
what
i
mean
ingram
but
the
associations
of
such
names
and
the
presence
of
the
stupendous
works
with
which
they
are
connected
fill
the
soul
with
awe
such
at
least
is
the
effect
with
i
fear
that
my
tendencies
miss
dawkins
are
more
realistic
than
your
you
belong
to
a
young
country
ingram
and
are
naturally
prone
to
think
of
material
life
the
necessity
of
living
looms
large
before
very
large
indeed
miss
whereas
with
us
with
some
of
us
at
least
the
material
aspect
has
given
place
to
one
in
which
poetry
and
enthusiasm
prevail
to
such
among
us
the
associations
of
past
times
are
very
dear
cheops
to
me
is
more
than
napoleon
that
is
more
than
most
of
your
countrymen
can
say
at
any
rate
just
at
i
am
a
woman
continued
miss
dawkins
ingram
took
off
his
hat
in
acknowledgment
both
of
the
announcement
and
of
the
fact
and
to
us
it
is
not
given
as
share
in
the
great
deeds
of
the
present
the
envy
of
your
sex
has
driven
us
from
the
paths
which
lead
to
honour
but
the
deeds
of
the
past
are
as
much
ours
as
oh
quite
as
tis
to
your
country
that
we
look
for
enfranchisement
from
this
thraldom
yes
ingram
the
women
of
america
have
that
strength
of
mind
which
has
been
wanting
to
those
of
europe
in
the
united
states
woman
will
at
last
learn
to
exercise
her
proper
ingram
expressed
a
sincere
wish
that
such
might
be
the
case
and
then
wondering
at
the
ingenuity
with
which
miss
dawkins
had
travelled
round
from
cheops
and
his
pyramid
to
the
rights
of
women
in
america
he
contrived
to
fall
back
under
the
pretence
of
asking
after
the
ailments
of
damer
and
now
at
last
they
were
on
the
sand
in
the
absolute
desert
making
their
way
up
to
the
very
foot
of
the
most
northern
of
the
two
pyramids
they
were
by
this
time
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
arab
guides
or
arabs
professing
to
be
guides
who
had
already
ascertained
that
damer
was
the
chief
of
the
party
and
were
accordingly
driving
him
almost
to
madness
by
the
offers
of
their
services
and
their
assurance
that
he
could
not
possibly
see
the
outside
or
the
inside
of
either
structure
or
even
remain
alive
upon
the
ground
unless
he
at
once
accepted
their
offers
made
at
their
own
prices
get
away
will
you
said
he
i
don
t
want
any
of
you
and
i
won
t
have
you
if
you
take
hold
of
me
i
ll
shoot
you
this
was
said
to
one
specially
energetic
arab
who
in
his
efforts
to
secure
his
prey
had
caught
hold
of
damer
by
the
leg
yes
yes
i
say
englishmen
always
take
me
and
then
no
break
him
leg
go
master
say
yes
only
one
leetle
ten
shillings
abdallah
shouted
damer
why
don
t
you
take
this
man
away
why
don
t
you
make
him
understand
that
if
all
the
pyramids
depended
on
it
i
would
not
give
him
sixpence
and
then
abdallah
thus
invoked
came
up
and
explained
to
the
man
in
arabic
that
he
would
gain
his
object
more
surely
if
he
would
behave
himself
a
little
more
quietly
a
hint
which
the
man
took
for
one
minute
and
for
one
minute
only
and
then
poor
damer
replied
to
an
application
for
backsheish
by
the
gift
of
a
sixpence
unfortunate
woman
the
word
backsheish
means
i
believe
a
gift
but
it
has
come
in
egypt
to
signify
money
and
is
eternally
dinned
into
the
ears
of
strangers
by
arab
suppliants
damer
ought
to
have
known
better
as
during
the
last
six
weeks
she
had
never
shown
her
face
out
of
shepheard
s
hotel
without
being
pestered
for
backsheish
but
she
was
tired
and
weak
and
foolishly
thought
to
rid
herself
of
the
man
who
was
annoying
her
no
sooner
had
the
coin
dropped
from
her
hand
into
that
of
the
arab
than
she
was
surrounded
by
a
cluster
of
beggars
who
loudly
made
their
petitions
as
though
they
would
each
of
them
individually
be
injured
if
treated
with
less
liberality
than
that
first
comer
they
took
hold
of
her
donkey
her
bridle
her
saddle
her
legs
and
at
last
her
arms
and
hands
screaming
for
backsheish
in
voices
that
were
neither
sweet
nor
mild
in
her
dismay
she
did
give
away
sundry
small
probably
that
she
had
about
her
but
this
only
made
the
matter
worse
money
was
going
and
each
man
by
sufficient
energy
might
hope
to
get
some
of
it
they
were
very
energetic
and
so
frightened
the
poor
lady
that
she
would
certainly
have
fallen
had
she
not
been
kept
on
her
seat
by
the
pressure
around
her
oh
dear
oh
dear
get
away
she
cried
i
haven
t
got
any
more
indeed
i
haven
t
go
away
i
tell
you
damer
oh
damer
and
then
in
the
excess
of
her
agony
she
uttered
one
loud
long
and
continuous
shriek
up
came
damer
up
came
abdallah
up
came
delabordeau
up
came
ingram
and
at
last
she
was
rescued
you
shouldn
t
go
away
and
leave
me
to
the
mercy
of
these
nasty
people
as
to
that
abdallah
he
is
of
no
use
to
why
you
bodder
de
good
lady
you
dem
blackguard
said
abdallah
raising
his
stick
as
though
he
were
going
to
lay
them
all
low
with
a
blow
now
you
get
noting
you
tief
the
arabs
for
a
moment
retired
to
a
little
distance
like
flies
driven
from
a
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
like
the
flies
they
would
return
at
the
first
vacant
moment
and
now
they
had
reached
the
very
foot
of
the
pyramids
and
proceeded
to
dismount
from
their
donkeys
their
intention
was
first
to
ascend
to
the
top
then
to
come
down
to
their
banquet
and
after
that
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
and
all
this
would
seem
to
be
easy
of
performance
the
pyramid
is
undoubtedly
high
but
it
is
so
constructed
as
to
admit
of
climbing
without
difficulty
a
lady
mounting
it
would
undoubtedly
need
some
assistance
but
any
man
possessed
of
moderate
activity
would
require
no
aid
at
all
but
our
friends
were
at
once
imbued
with
the
tremendous
nature
of
the
task
before
them
a
sheikh
of
the
arabs
came
forth
who
communicated
with
them
through
abdallah
the
work
could
be
done
no
doubt
he
said
but
a
great
many
men
would
be
wanted
to
assist
each
lady
must
have
four
arabs
and
each
gentlemen
three
and
then
seeing
that
the
work
would
be
peculiarly
severe
on
this
special
day
each
of
these
numerous
arabs
must
be
remunerated
by
some
very
large
number
of
piastres
damer
who
was
by
no
means
a
close
man
in
his
money
dealings
opened
his
eyes
with
surprise
and
mildly
expostulated
delabordeau
who
was
rather
a
close
man
in
his
reckonings
immediately
buttoned
up
his
breeches
pocket
and
declared
that
he
should
decline
to
mount
the
pyramid
at
all
at
that
price
and
then
ingram
descended
to
the
combat
the
protestations
of
the
men
were
fearful
they
declared
with
loud
voices
eager
actions
and
manifold
english
oaths
that
an
attempt
was
being
made
to
rob
them
they
had
a
right
to
demand
the
sums
which
they
were
charging
and
it
was
a
shame
that
english
gentlemen
should
come
and
take
the
bread
out
of
their
mouths
and
so
they
screeched
gesticulated
and
swore
and
frightened
poor
damer
almost
into
fits
but
at
last
it
was
settled
and
away
they
started
the
sheikh
declaring
that
the
bargain
had
been
made
at
so
low
a
rate
as
to
leave
him
not
one
piastre
for
himself
each
man
had
an
arab
on
each
side
of
him
and
miss
dawkins
and
miss
damer
had
each
in
addition
one
behind
damer
was
so
frightened
as
altogether
to
have
lost
all
ambition
to
ascend
she
sat
below
on
a
fragment
of
stone
with
the
three
dragomans
standing
around
her
as
guards
but
even
with
the
three
dragomans
the
attacks
on
her
were
so
frequent
and
as
she
declared
afterwards
she
was
so
bewildered
that
she
never
had
time
to
remember
that
she
had
come
there
from
england
to
see
the
pyramids
and
that
she
was
now
immediately
under
them
the
boys
utterly
ignoring
their
guides
scrambled
up
quicker
than
the
arabs
could
follow
them
damer
started
off
at
a
pace
which
soon
brought
him
to
the
end
of
his
tether
and
from
that
point
was
dragged
up
by
the
sheer
strength
of
his
assistants
thereby
accomplishing
the
wishes
of
the
men
who
induce
their
victims
to
start
as
rapidly
as
possible
in
order
that
they
may
soon
find
themselves
helpless
from
want
of
wind
ingram
endeavoured
to
attach
himself
to
fanny
and
she
would
have
been
nothing
loth
to
have
him
at
her
right
hand
instead
of
the
hideous
brown
shrieking
arab
who
took
hold
of
her
but
it
was
soon
found
that
any
such
arrangement
was
impossible
each
guide
felt
that
if
he
lost
his
own
peculiar
hold
he
would
lose
his
prey
and
held
on
therefore
with
invincible
tenacity
miss
dawkins
looked
too
as
though
she
had
thought
to
be
attended
to
by
some
christian
cavalier
but
no
christian
cavalier
was
forthcoming
delabordeau
was
the
wisest
for
he
took
the
matter
quietly
did
as
he
was
bid
and
allowed
the
guides
nearly
to
carry
him
to
the
top
of
the
edifice
ha
so
this
is
the
top
of
the
pyramid
is
it
said
damer
bringing
out
his
words
one
by
one
being
terribly
out
of
breath
very
wonderful
very
wonderful
indeed
it
is
wonderful
said
miss
dawkins
whose
breath
had
not
failed
her
in
the
least
very
wonderful
indeed
only
think
damer
you
might
travel
on
for
days
and
days
till
days
became
months
through
those
interminable
sands
and
yet
you
would
never
come
to
the
end
of
them
is
it
not
quite
stupendous
ah
yes
quite
puff
damer
striving
to
regain
his
breath
damer
was
now
at
her
disposal
weak
and
worn
with
toil
and
travel
out
of
breath
and
with
half
his
manhood
gone
if
ever
she
might
prevail
over
him
so
as
to
procure
from
his
mouth
an
assent
to
that
nile
proposition
it
would
be
now
and
after
all
that
nile
proposition
was
the
best
one
now
before
her
she
did
not
quite
like
the
idea
of
starting
off
across
the
great
desert
without
any
lady
and
was
not
sure
that
she
was
prepared
to
be
fallen
in
love
with
by
delabordeau
even
if
there
should
ultimately
be
any
readiness
on
the
part
of
that
gentleman
to
perform
the
rôle
of
lover
with
ingram
the
matter
was
different
nor
was
she
so
diffident
of
her
own
charms
as
to
think
it
altogether
impossible
that
she
might
succeed
in
the
teeth
of
that
little
chit
fanny
damer
that
ingram
would
join
the
party
up
the
nile
she
had
very
little
doubt
and
then
there
would
be
one
place
left
for
her
she
would
thus
at
any
rate
become
commingled
with
a
most
respectable
family
who
might
be
of
material
service
to
her
thus
actuated
she
commenced
an
earnest
attack
upon
damer
stupendous
she
said
again
for
she
was
fond
of
repeating
favourite
words
what
a
wondrous
race
must
have
been
those
egyptian
kings
of
old
i
dare
say
they
were
said
damer
wiping
his
brow
as
he
sat
upon
a
large
loose
stone
a
fragment
lying
on
the
flat
top
of
the
pyramid
one
of
those
stones
with
which
the
complete
apex
was
once
made
or
was
once
about
to
be
made
a
magnificent
race
so
gigantic
in
their
conceptions
their
ideas
altogether
overwhelm
us
poor
insignificant
mortals
they
built
these
vast
pyramids
but
for
us
it
is
task
enough
to
climb
to
their
quite
enough
ejaculated
damer
but
damer
would
not
always
remain
weak
and
out
of
breath
and
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
miss
dawkins
to
hurry
away
from
cheops
and
his
tomb
to
thebes
and
karnac
after
seeing
this
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
with
a
spark
of
imagination
to
leave
egypt
without
going
farther
damer
merely
wiped
his
brow
and
grunted
this
miss
dawkins
took
as
a
signal
of
weakness
and
went
on
with
her
task
perseveringly
for
myself
i
have
resolved
to
go
up
at
any
rate
as
far
as
asouan
and
the
first
cataract
i
had
thought
of
acceding
to
the
wishes
of
a
party
who
are
going
across
the
great
desert
by
mount
sinai
to
jerusalem
but
the
kindness
of
yourself
and
damer
is
so
great
and
the
prospect
of
joining
in
your
boat
is
so
pleasurable
that
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
accept
your
very
kind
this
it
will
be
acknowledged
was
bold
on
the
part
of
miss
dawkins
but
what
will
not
audacity
effect
to
use
the
slang
of
modern
language
cheek
carries
everything
nowadays
and
whatever
may
have
been
miss
dawkins
s
deficiencies
in
this
virtue
she
was
not
deficient
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
accept
your
very
kind
offer
she
said
shining
on
damer
with
her
blandest
smile
what
was
a
stout
breathless
perspiring
gentleman
to
do
under
such
circumstances
damer
was
a
man
who
in
most
matters
had
his
own
way
that
his
wife
should
have
given
such
an
invitation
without
consulting
him
was
he
knew
quite
impossible
she
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
asking
all
those
arab
guides
to
accompany
them
nor
was
it
to
be
thought
of
that
he
should
allow
himself
to
be
kidnapped
into
such
an
arrangement
by
the
impudence
of
any
miss
dawkins
but
there
was
he
felt
a
difficulty
in
answering
such
a
proposition
from
a
young
lady
with
a
direct
negative
especially
while
he
was
so
scant
of
breath
so
he
wiped
his
brow
again
and
looked
at
her
but
i
can
only
agree
to
this
on
one
understanding
continued
miss
dawkins
and
that
is
that
i
am
allowed
to
defray
my
own
full
share
of
the
expense
of
the
upon
hearing
this
damer
thought
that
he
saw
his
way
out
of
the
wood
wherever
i
go
miss
dawkins
i
am
always
the
paymaster
myself
and
this
he
contrived
to
say
with
some
sternness
palpitating
though
he
still
was
and
the
sternness
which
was
deficient
in
his
voice
he
endeavoured
to
put
into
his
countenance
but
he
did
not
know
miss
dawkins
oh
damer
she
said
and
as
she
spoke
her
smile
became
almost
blander
than
it
was
before
oh
damer
i
could
not
think
of
suffering
you
to
be
so
liberal
i
could
not
indeed
but
i
shall
be
quite
content
that
you
should
pay
everything
and
let
me
settle
with
you
in
one
sum
damer
s
breath
was
now
rather
more
under
his
own
command
i
am
afraid
miss
dawkins
he
said
that
damer
s
weak
state
of
health
will
not
admit
of
such
an
what
about
the
paying
not
only
as
to
that
but
we
are
a
family
party
miss
dawkins
and
great
as
would
be
the
benefit
of
your
society
to
all
of
us
in
damer
s
present
state
of
health
i
am
short
you
would
not
find
it
this
he
added
seeing
that
she
was
still
about
to
i
fear
that
we
must
forego
the
advantage
you
and
then
looking
into
his
face
miss
dawkins
did
perceive
that
even
her
audacity
would
not
prevail
oh
very
well
she
said
and
moving
from
the
stone
on
which
she
had
been
sitting
she
walked
off
carrying
her
head
very
high
to
a
corner
of
the
pyramid
from
which
she
could
look
forth
alone
towards
the
sands
of
libya
in
the
mean
time
another
little
overture
was
being
made
on
the
top
of
the
same
pyramid
overture
which
was
not
received
quite
in
the
same
spirit
while
damer
was
recovering
his
breath
for
the
sake
of
answering
miss
dawkins
miss
damer
had
walked
to
the
further
corner
of
the
square
platform
on
which
they
were
placed
and
there
sat
herself
down
with
her
face
turned
towards
cairo
perhaps
it
was
not
singular
that
ingram
should
have
followed
her
this
would
have
been
very
well
if
a
dozen
arabs
had
not
also
followed
them
but
as
this
was
the
case
ingram
had
to
play
his
game
under
some
difficulty
he
had
no
sooner
seated
himself
beside
her
than
they
came
and
stood
directly
in
front
of
the
seat
shutting
out
the
view
and
by
no
means
improving
the
fragrance
of
the
air
around
them
and
this
then
miss
damer
will
be
our
last
excursion
together
he
said
in
his
tenderest
softest
tone
de
good
englishman
will
gib
de
poor
arab
one
little
backsheish
said
an
arab
putting
out
his
hand
and
shaking
ingram
s
shoulder
yes
yes
yes
him
gib
backsheish
said
another
him
berry
good
man
said
a
third
putting
up
his
filthy
hand
and
touching
ingram
s
face
and
young
lady
berry
good
too
she
give
backsheish
to
poor
yes
said
a
fourth
preparing
to
take
a
similar
liberty
with
miss
damer
this
was
too
much
for
ingram
he
had
already
used
very
positive
language
in
his
endeavour
to
assure
his
tormentors
that
they
would
not
get
a
piastre
from
him
but
this
only
changed
their
soft
persuasions
into
threats
upon
hearing
which
and
upon
seeing
what
the
man
attempted
to
do
in
his
endeavour
to
get
money
from
miss
damer
he
raised
his
stick
and
struck
first
one
and
then
the
other
as
violently
as
he
could
upon
their
heads
any
ordinary
civilised
men
would
have
been
stunned
by
such
blows
for
they
fell
on
the
bare
foreheads
of
the
arabs
but
the
objects
of
the
american
s
wrath
merely
skulked
away
and
the
others
convinced
by
the
only
arguments
which
they
understood
followed
in
pursuit
of
victims
who
might
be
less
pugnacious
it
is
hard
for
a
man
to
be
at
once
tender
and
be
sentimental
while
he
is
putting
forth
his
physical
strength
with
all
the
violence
in
his
power
it
is
difficult
also
for
him
to
be
gentle
instantly
after
having
been
in
a
rage
so
he
changed
his
tactics
at
the
moment
and
came
to
the
point
at
once
in
a
manner
befitting
his
present
state
of
mind
those
vile
wretches
have
put
me
in
such
a
heat
he
said
that
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
saying
but
the
fact
is
this
miss
damer
i
can
not
leave
cairo
without
you
understand
what
i
mean
miss
indeed
i
do
not
ingram
except
that
i
am
afraid
you
mean
yes
you
do
you
know
that
i
love
you
i
am
sure
you
must
know
it
at
any
rate
you
know
it
mr
ingram
you
should
not
talk
in
such
a
why
should
i
not
but
the
truth
is
fanny
i
can
talk
in
no
other
way
i
do
love
you
dearly
can
you
love
me
well
enough
to
go
and
be
my
wife
in
a
country
far
away
from
your
own
before
she
left
the
top
of
the
pyramid
fanny
damer
had
said
that
she
would
try
ingram
was
now
a
proud
and
happy
man
and
seemed
to
think
the
steps
of
the
pyramid
too
small
for
his
elastic
energy
but
fanny
feared
that
her
troubles
were
to
come
there
was
terrible
bugbear
on
all
such
occasions
what
would
papa
say
she
was
sure
her
papa
would
not
allow
her
to
marry
and
go
so
far
away
from
her
own
family
and
country
for
herself
she
liked
the
had
liked
them
so
she
said
desire
nothing
better
than
to
live
among
them
but
papa
and
fanny
sighed
as
she
felt
that
all
the
recognised
miseries
of
a
young
lady
in
love
were
about
to
fall
upon
her
nevertheless
at
her
lover
s
instance
she
promised
and
declared
in
twenty
different
loving
phrases
that
nothing
on
earth
should
ever
make
her
false
to
her
love
or
to
her
lover
fanny
where
are
you
why
are
you
not
ready
to
come
down
shouted
damer
not
in
the
best
of
tempers
he
felt
that
he
had
almost
been
unkind
to
an
unprotected
female
and
his
heart
misgave
him
and
yet
it
would
have
misgiven
him
more
had
he
allowed
himself
to
be
entrapped
by
miss
dawkins
i
am
quite
ready
papa
said
fanny
running
up
to
it
may
be
understood
that
there
is
quite
room
enough
for
a
young
lady
to
run
on
the
top
of
the
pyramid
i
am
sure
i
don
t
know
where
you
have
been
all
the
time
said
damer
and
where
are
those
two
boys
fanny
pointed
to
the
top
of
the
other
pyramid
and
there
they
were
conspicuous
with
their
red
caps
and
delabordeau
oh
he
has
gone
down
i
think
he
is
there
with
miss
and
in
truth
miss
dawkins
was
leaning
on
his
arm
most
affectionately
as
she
stooped
over
and
looked
down
upon
the
ruins
below
her
and
where
is
that
fellow
ingram
said
damer
looking
about
him
he
is
always
out
of
the
way
when
he
s
to
this
fanny
said
nothing
why
should
she
she
was
not
ingram
s
keeper
and
then
they
all
descended
each
again
with
his
proper
number
of
arabs
to
hurry
and
embarrass
him
and
they
found
damer
at
the
bottom
like
a
piece
of
sugar
covered
with
flies
she
was
heard
to
declare
afterwards
that
she
would
not
go
to
the
pyramids
again
not
if
they
were
to
be
given
to
her
for
herself
as
ornaments
for
her
garden
the
picnic
lunch
among
the
big
stones
at
the
foot
of
the
pyramid
was
not
a
very
gay
affair
miss
dawkins
talked
more
than
any
one
else
being
determined
to
show
that
she
bore
her
defeat
gallantly
her
conversation
however
was
chiefly
addressed
to
delabordeau
and
he
seemed
to
think
more
of
his
cold
chicken
and
ham
than
he
did
of
her
wit
and
attention
fanny
hardly
spoke
a
word
there
was
her
father
before
her
and
she
could
not
eat
much
less
talk
as
she
thought
of
all
that
she
would
have
to
go
through
what
would
he
say
to
the
idea
of
having
an
american
for
a
nor
was
ingram
very
lively
a
young
man
when
he
has
been
just
accepted
never
is
so
his
happiness
under
the
present
circumstances
was
no
doubt
intense
but
it
was
of
a
silent
nature
and
then
the
interior
of
the
building
had
to
be
visited
to
tell
the
truth
none
of
the
party
would
have
cared
to
perform
this
feat
had
it
not
been
for
the
honour
of
the
thing
to
have
come
from
paris
new
york
or
london
to
the
pyramids
and
then
not
to
have
visited
the
very
tomb
of
cheops
would
have
shown
on
the
part
of
all
of
them
an
indifference
to
subjects
of
interest
which
would
have
been
altogether
fatal
to
their
character
as
travellers
and
so
a
party
for
the
interior
was
made
up
miss
damer
when
she
saw
the
aperture
through
which
it
was
expected
that
she
should
descend
at
once
declared
for
staying
with
her
mother
miss
dawkins
however
was
enthusiastic
for
the
journey
persons
with
so
very
little
command
over
their
nerves
might
really
as
well
stay
at
home
she
said
to
ingram
who
glowered
at
her
dreadfully
for
expressing
such
an
opinion
about
his
fanny
this
entrance
into
the
pyramids
is
a
terrible
task
which
should
be
undertaken
by
no
lady
those
who
perform
it
have
to
creep
down
and
then
to
be
dragged
up
through
infinite
dirt
foul
smells
and
bad
air
and
when
they
have
done
it
they
see
nothing
but
they
do
earn
the
gratification
of
saying
that
they
have
been
inside
a
pyramid
well
i
ve
done
that
once
said
damer
coming
out
and
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
will
catch
me
doing
it
again
i
never
was
in
such
a
filthy
place
in
my
oh
fanny
i
am
so
glad
you
did
not
go
i
am
sure
it
is
not
fit
for
ladies
said
poor
damer
forgetful
of
her
friend
miss
dawkins
i
should
have
been
ashamed
of
myself
said
miss
dawkins
bristling
up
and
throwing
back
her
head
as
she
stood
if
i
had
allowed
any
consideration
to
have
prevented
my
visiting
such
a
spot
if
it
be
not
improper
for
men
to
go
there
how
can
it
be
improper
for
women
i
did
not
say
improper
my
dear
said
damer
apologetically
and
as
for
the
fatigue
what
can
a
woman
be
worth
who
is
afraid
to
encounter
as
much
as
i
have
now
gone
through
for
the
sake
of
visiting
the
last
of
such
a
king
as
cheops
and
miss
dawkins
as
she
pronounced
the
last
words
looked
round
her
with
disdain
upon
poor
fanny
damer
but
i
meant
the
dirt
said
damer
dirt
ejaculated
miss
dawkins
and
then
walked
away
why
should
she
now
submit
her
high
tone
of
feeling
to
the
damers
or
why
care
longer
for
their
good
opinion
therefore
she
scattered
contempt
around
her
as
she
ejaculated
the
last
word
and
then
the
return
home
i
know
i
shall
never
get
there
said
damer
looking
piteously
up
into
her
husband
s
face
nonsense
my
dear
nonsense
you
must
get
damer
groaned
and
acknowledged
in
her
heart
that
she
must
dead
or
alive
and
jefferson
said
fanny
there
had
been
a
moment
since
their
descent
in
which
she
had
been
instructed
to
call
him
by
his
christian
never
mind
talking
to
me
going
home
i
will
ride
by
mamma
do
you
go
with
papa
and
put
him
in
good
humour
and
it
he
says
anything
about
the
lords
and
the
bishops
don
t
you
contradict
him
you
what
will
not
a
man
do
for
love
ingram
promised
and
in
this
way
they
started
the
two
boys
led
the
van
then
came
damer
and
ingram
unusually
and
unpatriotically
acquiescent
as
to
england
s
aristocratic
propensities
then
miss
dawkins
riding
alas
alone
after
her
delabordeau
also
alone
ungallant
frenchman
and
the
rear
was
brought
up
by
damer
and
her
daughter
flanked
on
each
side
by
a
dragoman
with
a
third
dragoman
behind
them
and
in
this
order
they
went
back
to
cairo
riding
their
donkeys
and
crossing
the
ferry
solemnly
and
for
the
most
part
silently
ingram
did
talk
as
he
had
an
important
object
in
view
of
putting
damer
into
a
good
humour
in
this
he
succeeded
so
well
that
by
the
time
they
had
remounted
after
crossing
the
nile
damer
opened
his
heart
to
his
companion
on
the
subject
that
was
troubling
him
and
told
him
all
about
miss
dawkins
i
don
t
see
why
we
should
have
a
companion
that
we
don
t
like
for
eight
or
ten
weeks
merely
because
it
seems
rude
to
refuse
a
indeed
i
agree
with
you
said
ingram
i
should
call
it
to
give
way
in
such
a
my
daughter
does
not
like
her
at
all
continued
damer
nor
would
she
be
a
nice
companion
for
miss
damer
not
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
said
ingram
and
as
to
my
having
asked
her
or
damer
having
asked
her
why
god
bless
my
soul
it
is
pure
invention
on
the
woman
s
part
ha
ha
ha
laughed
ingram
i
must
say
she
plays
her
game
well
but
then
she
is
an
old
soldier
and
has
the
benefit
of
what
would
miss
dawkins
have
said
had
she
known
that
ingram
called
her
an
old
soldier
i
don
t
like
the
kind
of
thing
at
all
said
damer
who
was
very
serious
upon
the
subject
you
see
the
position
in
which
i
am
placed
i
am
forced
to
be
very
rude
i
don
t
call
it
rude
at
disobliging
then
or
else
i
must
have
all
my
comfort
invaded
and
pleasure
destroyed
by
by
and
damer
paused
being
at
a
loss
for
an
appropriate
name
for
miss
dawkins
by
an
unprotected
female
suggested
ingram
yes
just
so
i
am
as
fond
of
pleasant
company
as
anybody
but
then
i
like
to
choose
it
so
do
i
said
ingram
thinking
of
his
own
choice
now
ingram
if
you
would
join
us
we
should
be
upon
my
word
sir
the
offer
is
too
flattering
said
ingram
hesitatingly
for
he
felt
that
he
could
not
undertake
such
a
journey
until
damer
knew
on
what
terms
he
stood
with
fanny
you
are
a
terrible
democrat
said
damer
laughing
but
then
on
that
matter
you
know
we
could
agree
to
exactly
so
said
ingram
who
had
not
collected
his
thoughts
or
made
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
had
better
say
and
do
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
well
what
do
you
say
to
it
said
damer
encouragingly
but
ingram
paused
before
he
answered
for
heaven
s
sake
my
dear
fellow
don
t
have
the
slightest
hesitation
in
refusing
if
you
don
t
like
the
the
fact
is
damer
i
should
like
it
too
like
it
too
well
yes
sir
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
as
later
i
had
intended
this
evening
to
have
asked
for
your
permission
to
address
your
god
bless
my
soul
said
damer
looking
as
though
a
totally
new
idea
had
now
been
opened
to
him
and
under
these
circumstances
i
will
now
wait
and
see
whether
or
no
you
will
renew
your
god
bless
my
soul
said
damer
again
it
often
does
strike
an
old
gentleman
as
very
odd
that
any
man
should
fall
in
love
with
his
daughter
whom
he
has
not
ceased
to
look
upon
as
a
child
the
case
is
generally
quite
different
with
mothers
they
seem
to
think
that
every
young
man
must
fall
in
love
with
their
girls
and
have
you
said
anything
to
fanny
about
this
asked
damer
yes
sir
i
have
her
permission
to
speak
to
god
bless
my
soul
said
damer
and
by
this
time
they
had
arrived
at
shepheard
s
hotel
oh
mamma
said
fanny
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
alone
with
her
mother
that
evening
i
have
something
that
i
must
tell
oh
fanny
don
t
tell
me
anything
for
i
am
a
great
deal
too
tired
to
but
oh
mamma
pray
must
listen
to
this
indeed
you
and
fanny
knelt
down
at
her
mother
s
knee
and
looked
beseechingly
up
into
her
face
what
is
it
fanny
you
know
that
all
my
bones
are
sore
and
i
am
so
tired
that
i
am
almost
mamma
ingram
has
what
my
dear
has
he
done
anything
wrong
no
mamma
but
he
has
has
proposed
to
and
fanny
bursting
into
tears
hid
her
face
in
her
mother
s
lap
and
thus
the
story
was
told
on
both
sides
of
the
house
on
the
next
day
as
a
matter
of
course
all
the
difficulties
and
dangers
of
such
a
marriage
as
that
which
was
now
projected
were
insisted
on
by
both
father
and
mother
it
was
improper
it
would
cause
a
severing
of
the
family
not
to
be
thought
of
it
would
be
an
alliance
of
a
dangerous
nature
and
not
at
all
calculated
to
insure
happiness
and
in
short
it
was
impossible
on
that
day
therefore
they
all
went
to
bed
very
unhappy
but
on
the
next
day
as
was
also
a
matter
of
course
seeing
that
there
were
no
pecuniary
difficulties
the
mother
and
father
were
talked
over
and
ingram
was
accepted
as
a
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
the
offer
of
a
place
in
damer
s
boat
was
again
made
and
that
on
this
occasion
it
was
accepted
without
hesitation
there
was
an
american
protestant
clergyman
resident
in
cairo
with
whom
among
other
persons
miss
dawkins
had
become
acquainted
upon
this
gentleman
or
upon
his
wife
miss
dawkins
called
a
few
days
after
the
journey
to
the
pyramid
and
finding
him
in
his
study
thus
performed
her
duty
to
her
neighbour
you
know
your
countryman
ingram
i
think
said
she
oh
yes
very
if
you
have
any
regard
for
him
burton
such
was
the
gentleman
s
name
i
think
you
should
put
him
on
his
on
his
guard
against
what
said
burton
with
a
serious
air
for
there
was
something
serious
in
the
threat
of
impending
misfortune
as
conveyed
by
miss
dawkins
why
said
she
those
damers
i
fear
are
dangerous
do
you
mean
that
they
will
borrow
money
of
him
oh
no
not
that
exactly
but
they
are
clearly
setting
their
cap
at
setting
their
cap
at
him
yes
there
is
a
daughter
you
know
a
little
chit
of
a
thing
and
i
fear
ingram
may
be
caught
before
he
knows
where
he
is
it
would
be
such
a
pity
you
know
he
is
going
up
the
river
with
them
i
hear
that
in
his
place
is
very
foolish
they
asked
me
but
i
positively
burton
remarked
that
in
such
a
matter
as
that
ingram
would
be
perfectly
able
to
take
care
of
well
perhaps
so
but
seeing
what
was
going
on
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
tell
and
so
miss
dawkins
took
her
leave
ingram
did
go
up
the
nile
with
the
damers
as
did
an
old
friend
of
the
damers
who
arrived
from
england
and
a
very
pleasant
trip
they
had
of
it
and
as
far
as
the
present
historian
knows
the
two
lovers
were
shortly
afterwards
married
in
england
poor
miss
dawkins
was
left
in
cairo
for
some
time
on
her
beam
ends
but
she
was
one
of
those
who
are
not
easily
vanquished
after
an
interval
of
ten
days
she
made
acquaintance
with
an
irish
utterly
failed
in
moving
the
hard
heart
of
with
these
she
proceeded
to
constantinople
they
consisted
of
two
brothers
and
a
sister
and
were
therefore
very
convenient
for
matrimonial
purposes
but
nevertheless
when
i
last
heard
of
miss
dawkins
she
was
still
an
unprotected
female
