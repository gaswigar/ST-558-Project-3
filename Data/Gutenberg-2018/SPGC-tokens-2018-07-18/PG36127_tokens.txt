that
has
looked
on

doré
marvellous
illustrations
to
this
wild
legend
can
forget
the
impression
they
made
upon
his
imagination
i
do
not
refer
to
the
first
illustration
as
striking
where
the
jewish
shoemaker
is
refusing
to
suffer
the
savior
to
rest
a
moment
on
his
and
is
receiving
with
scornful
lip
the
judgment
to
wander
restless
till
the
second
coming
of
that
same
redeemer
but
i
refer
rather
to
the
second
which
represents
the
jew
after
the
lapse
of
ages
bowed
beneath
the
burden
of
the
curse
worn
with
unrelieved
toil
wearied
with
ceaseless
travelling
trudging
onward
at
the
last
lights
of
evening
when
a
rayless
night
of
unabating
rain
is
creeping
on
along
a
sloppy
path
between
dripping
bushes
and
suddenly
he
comes
over
against
a
wayside
crucifix
on
which
the
white
glare
of
departing
daylight
falls
to
throw
it
into
ghastly
relief
against
the
for
a
moment
we
see
the
working
of
the
miserable
shoemaker
mind
we
feel
that
he
is
recalling
the
tragedy
of
the
first
good
friday
and
his
head
hangs
heavier
on
his
breast
as
he
recalls
the
part
he
had
taken
in
that
awful
catastrophe
or
is
that
other
illustration
more
remarkable
where
the
wanderer
is
amongst
the
alps
at
the
brink
of
a
hideous
chasm
and
seeing
in
the
contorted
the
scene
of
the
via
dolorosa
he
is
lured
to
cast
himself
into
that
black
gulf
in
quest
of
rest
when
an
angel
flashes
out
of
the
gloom
with
the
sword
of
flame
turning
every
way
keeping
him
back
from
what
would
be
to
him
a
paradise
indeed
the
repose
of
death
or
that
last
scene
when
the
trumpet
sounds
and
earth
is
shivering
to
its
foundations
the
fire
is
bubbling
forth
through
the
rents
in
its
surface
and
the
dead
are
coming
together
flesh
to
flesh
and
bone
to
bone
and
muscle
to
muscle
then
the
weary
man
sits
down
and
casts
off
his
shoes
strange
sights
are
around
him
he
sees
them
not
strange
sounds
assail
his
ears
he
hears
but
one
the
which
gives
the
signal
for
him
to
stay
his
wanderings
and
rest
his
weary
feet
i
can
linger
over
those
noble
woodcuts
and
learn
from
them
something
new
each
time
that
i
study
them
they
are
full
of
latent
depths
of
thought
and
now
let
us
to
the
history
of
this
most
thrilling
of
all
mediæval
myths
if
a
myth
if
a
myth
i
say
for
who
can
say
for
certain
that
it
is
not
true
verily
i
say
unto
you
there
be
some
standing
here
which
shall
not
taste
of
death
till
they
see
the
son
of
man
coming
in
his
kingdom
are
our
lord
words
which
i
can
hardly
think
apply
to
the
destruction
of
jerusalem
as
commentators
explain
it
to
escape
the
difficulty
that
some
should
live
to
see
jerusalem
destroyed
was
not
very
surprising
and
hardly
needed
the
emphatic
verily
which
christ
only
used
when
speaking
something
of
peculiarly
solemn
or
mysterious
import
besides
luke
account
manifestly
refers
the
coming
in
the
kingdom
to
the
judgment
for
the
saying
stands
as
follows
whosoever
shall
be
ashamed
of
me
and
of
my
words
of
him
shall
the
son
of
man
be
ashamed
when
he
shall
come
in
his
own
glory
and
in
his
father
and
of
the
holy
angels
but
i
tell
you
of
a
truth
there
be
some
standing
here
which
shall
not
taste
of
death
till
they
see
the
kingdom
of
god
there
can
i
think
be
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
an
unprejudiced
person
that
the
words
of
our
lord
do
imply
that
some
one
or
more
of
those
then
living
should
not
die
till
he
came
again
i
do
not
mean
to
insist
on
the
literal
signification
but
i
plead
that
there
is
no
improbability
in
our
lord
words
being
fulfilled
to
the
letter
that
the
circumstance
is
unrecorded
in
the
gospels
is
no
evidence
that
it
did
not
take
place
for
we
are
expressly
told
many
other
signs
truly
did
jesus
in
the
presence
of
his
disciples
which
are
not
written
in
this
book
and
again
there
are
also
many
other
things
which
jesus
did
the
which
if
they
should
be
written
every
one
i
suppose
that
even
the
world
itself
could
not
contain
the
books
that
should
be
written
we
may
remember
also
the
mysterious
witnesses
who
are
to
appear
in
the
last
eventful
days
of
the
world
history
and
bear
testimony
to
the
gospel
truth
before
the
antichristian
world
one
of
these
has
been
often
conjectured
to
be
john
the
evangelist
of
whom
christ
said
to
peter
if
i
will
that
he
tarry
till
i
come
what
is
that
to
thee
the
historical
evidence
on
which
the
tale
rests
is
however
too
slender
for
us
to
admit
for
it
more
than
the
barest
claim
to
be
more
than
myth
the
names
and
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
jew
and
his
doom
vary
in
every
account
and
the
only
point
upon
which
all
coincide
is
that
such
an
individual
exists
in
an
undying
condition
wandering
over
the
face
of
the
earth
seeking
rest
and
finding
none
the
earliest
extant
mention
of
the
wandering
jew
is
to
be
found
in
the
book
of
the
chronicles
of
the
abbey
of
albans
which
was
copied
and
continued
by
matthew
paris
he
records
that
in
the
year
a
certain
archbishop
of
armenia
the
greater
came
on
a
pilgrimage
to
england
to
see
the
relics
of
the
saints
and
visit
the
sacred
places
in
the
kingdom
as
he
had
done
in
others
he
also
produced
letters
of
recommendation
from
his
holiness
the
pope
to
the
religious
and
the
prelates
of
the
churches
in
which
they
were
enjoined
to
receive
and
entertain
him
with
due
reverence
and
honor
on
his
arrival
he
came
to
albans
where
he
was
received
with
all
respect
by
the
abbot
and
the
monks
and
at
this
place
being
fatigued
with
his
journey
he
remained
some
days
to
rest
himself
and
his
followers
and
a
conversation
took
place
between
him
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
convent
by
means
of
their
interpreters
during
which
he
made
many
inquiries
relating
to
the
religion
and
religious
observances
of
this
country
and
told
many
strange
things
concerning
the
countries
of
the
east
in
the
course
of
conversation
he
was
asked
whether
he
had
ever
seen
or
heard
any
thing
of
joseph
a
man
of
whom
there
was
much
talk
in
the
world
who
when
our
lord
suffered
was
present
and
spoke
to
him
and
who
is
still
alive
in
evidence
of
the
christian
faith
in
reply
to
which
a
knight
in
his
retinue
who
was
his
interpreter
replied
speaking
in
french
lord
well
knows
that
man
and
a
little
before
he
took
his
way
to
the
western
countries
the
said
joseph
ate
at
the
table
of
my
lord
the
archbishop
of
armenia
and
he
has
often
seen
and
conversed
with
him
he
was
then
asked
about
what
had
passed
between
christ
and
the
said
joseph
to
which
he
replied
the
time
of
the
passion
of
jesus
christ
he
was
seized
by
the
jews
and
led
into
the
hall
of
judgment
before
pilate
the
governor
that
he
might
be
judged
by
him
on
the
accusation
of
the
jews
and
pilate
finding
no
fault
for
which
he
might
sentence
him
to
death
said
unto
them
take
him
and
judge
him
according
to
your
law
the
shouts
of
the
jews
however
increasing
he
at
their
request
released
unto
them
barabbas
and
delivered
jesus
to
them
to
be
crucified
when
therefore
the
jews
were
dragging
jesus
forth
and
had
reached
the
door
cartaphilus
a
porter
of
the
hall
in
pilate
service
as
jesus
was
going
out
of
the
door
impiously
struck
him
on
the
back
with
his
hand
and
said
in
mockery
go
quicker
jesus
go
quicker
why
do
you
loiter
and
jesus
looking
back
on
him
with
a
severe
countenance
said
to
him
i
am
going
and
you
shall
wait
till
i
return
and
according
as
our
lord
said
this
cartaphilus
is
still
awaiting
his
return
at
the
time
of
our
lord
suffering
he
was
thirty
years
old
and
when
he
attains
the
age
of
a
hundred
years
he
always
returns
to
the
same
age
as
he
was
when
our
lord
suffered
after
christ
death
when
the
catholic
faith
gained
ground
this
cartaphilus
was
baptized
by
ananias
who
also
baptized
the
apostle
paul
and
was
called
joseph
he
dwells
in
one
or
other
divisions
of
armenia
and
in
divers
eastern
countries
passing
his
time
amongst
the
bishops
and
other
prelates
of
the
church
he
is
a
man
of
holy
conversation
and
religious
a
man
of
few
words
and
very
circumspect
in
his
behavior
for
he
does
not
speak
at
all
unless
when
questioned
by
the
bishops
and
religious
and
then
he
relates
the
events
of
olden
times
and
speaks
of
things
which
occurred
at
the
suffering
and
resurrection
of
our
lord
and
of
the
witnesses
of
the
resurrection
namely
of
those
who
rose
with
christ
and
went
into
the
holy
city
and
appeared
unto
men
he
also
tells
of
the
creed
of
the
apostles
and
of
their
separation
and
preaching
and
all
this
he
relates
without
smiling
or
levity
of
conversation
as
one
who
is
well
practised
in
sorrow
and
the
fear
of
god
always
looking
forward
with
dread
to
the
coming
of
jesus
christ
lest
at
the
last
judgment
he
should
find
him
in
anger
whom
when
on
his
way
to
death
he
had
provoked
to
just
vengeance
numbers
came
to
him
from
different
parts
of
the
world
enjoying
his
society
and
conversation
and
to
them
if
they
are
men
of
authority
he
explains
all
doubts
on
the
matters
on
which
he
is
questioned
he
refuses
all
gifts
that
are
offered
him
being
content
with
slight
food
and
clothing
much
about
the
same
date
philip
mouskes
afterwards
bishop
of
tournay
wrote
his
rhymed
chronicle
which
contains
a
similar
account
of
the
jew
derived
from
the
same
armenian
prelate
adonques
vint
un
arceveskes
de
çà
mer
plains
de
bonnes
tèques
par
samblant
et
fut
and
this
man
having
visited
the
shrine
of
tumas
de
kantorbire
and
then
having
paid
his
devotions
at
monsigour
jake
he
went
on
to
cologne
to
see
the
heads
of
the
three
kings
the
version
told
in
the
netherlands
much
resembled
that
related
at
albans
only
that
the
jew
seeing
the
people
dragging
christ
to
his
death
exclaims
atendés
moi
vois
mis
le
faus
profète
en
crois
then
le
vrais
dieux
se
regarda
et
li
a
dit
tarda
icist
ne
pas
mais
saces
tu
we
hear
no
more
of
the
wandering
jew
till
the
sixteenth
century
when
we
hear
first
of
him
in
a
casual
manner
as
assisting
a
weaver
kokot
at
the
royal
palace
in
bohemia
to
find
a
treasure
which
had
been
secreted
by
the
of
kokot
sixty
years
before
at
which
time
the
jew
was
present
he
then
had
the
appearance
of
being
a
man
of
seventy
years
curiously
enough
we
next
hear
of
him
in
the
east
where
he
is
confounded
with
the
prophet
elijah
early
in
the
century
he
appeared
to
fadhilah
under
peculiar
circumstances
after
the
arabs
had
captured
the
city
of
elvan
fadhilah
at
the
head
of
three
hundred
horsemen
pitched
his
tents
late
in
the
evening
between
two
mountains
fadhilah
having
begun
his
evening
prayer
with
a
loud
voice
heard
the
words
allah
akbar
god
is
great
repeated
distinctly
and
each
word
of
his
prayer
was
followed
in
a
similar
manner
fadhilah
not
believing
this
to
be
the
result
of
an
echo
was
much
astonished
and
cried
out
o
thou
whether
thou
art
of
the
angel
ranks
or
whether
thou
art
of
some
other
order
of
spirits
it
is
well
the
power
of
god
be
with
thee
but
if
thou
art
a
man
then
let
mine
eyes
light
upon
thee
that
i
may
rejoice
in
thy
presence
and
society
scarcely
had
he
spoken
these
words
before
an
aged
man
with
bald
head
stood
before
him
holding
a
staff
in
his
hand
and
much
resembling
a
dervish
in
appearance
after
having
courteously
saluted
him
fadhilah
asked
the
old
man
who
he
was
thereupon
the
stranger
answered
bassi
hadhret
issa
i
am
here
by
command
of
the
lord
jesus
who
has
left
me
in
this
world
that
i
may
live
therein
until
he
comes
a
second
time
to
earth
i
wait
for
this
lord
who
is
the
fountain
of
happiness
and
in
obedience
to
his
command
i
dwell
behind
yon
mountain
when
fadhilah
heard
these
words
he
asked
when
the
lord
jesus
would
appear
and
the
old
man
replied
that
his
appearing
would
be
at
the
end
of
the
world
at
the
last
judgment
but
this
only
increased
fadhilah
curiosity
so
that
he
inquired
the
signs
of
the
approach
of
the
end
of
all
things
whereupon
zerib
bar
elia
gave
him
an
account
of
general
social
and
moral
dissolution
which
would
be
the
climax
of
this
world
history
in
he
was
seen
in
europe
if
we
are
to
believe
the
following
narration
paul
von
eitzen
doctor
of
the
holy
scriptures
and
bishop
of
schleswig
related
as
true
for
some
years
past
that
when
he
was
young
having
studied
at
wittemberg
he
returned
home
to
his
parents
in
hamburg
in
the
winter
of
the
year
and
that
on
the
following
sunday
in
church
he
observed
a
tall
man
with
his
hair
hanging
over
his
shoulders
standing
barefoot
during
the
sermon
over
against
the
pulpit
listening
with
deepest
attention
to
the
discourse
and
whenever
the
name
of
jesus
was
mentioned
bowing
himself
profoundly
and
humbly
with
sighs
and
beating
of
the
breast
he
had
no
other
clothing
in
the
bitter
cold
of
the
winter
except
a
pair
of
hose
which
were
in
tatters
about
his
feet
and
a
coat
with
a
girdle
which
reached
to
his
feet
and
his
general
appearance
was
that
of
a
man
of
fifty
years
and
many
people
some
of
high
degree
and
title
have
seen
this
same
man
in
england
france
italy
hungary
persia
spain
poland
moscow
lapland
sweden
denmark
scotland
and
other
places
every
one
wondered
over
the
man
now
after
the
sermon
the
said
doctor
inquired
diligently
where
the
stranger
was
to
be
found
and
when
he
had
sought
him
out
he
inquired
of
him
privately
whence
he
came
and
how
long
that
winter
he
had
been
in
the
place
thereupon
he
replied
modestly
that
he
was
a
jew
by
birth
a
native
of
jerusalem
by
name
ahasverus
by
trade
a
shoemaker
he
had
been
present
at
the
crucifixion
of
christ
and
had
lived
ever
since
travelling
through
various
lands
and
cities
the
which
he
substantiated
by
accounts
he
gave
he
related
also
the
circumstances
of
christ
transference
from
pilate
to
herod
and
the
final
crucifixion
together
with
other
details
not
recorded
in
the
evangelists
and
historians
he
gave
accounts
of
the
changes
of
government
in
many
countries
especially
of
the
east
through
several
centuries
and
moreover
he
detailed
the
labors
and
deaths
of
the
holy
apostles
of
christ
most
circumstantially
now
when
doctor
paul
eitzen
heard
this
with
profound
astonishment
on
account
of
its
incredible
novelty
he
inquired
further
in
order
that
he
might
obtain
more
accurate
information
then
the
man
answered
that
he
had
lived
in
jerusalem
at
the
time
of
the
crucifixion
of
christ
whom
he
had
regarded
as
a
deceiver
of
the
people
and
a
heretic
he
had
seen
him
with
his
own
eyes
and
had
done
his
best
along
with
others
to
bring
this
deceiver
as
he
regarded
him
to
justice
and
to
have
him
put
out
of
the
way
when
the
sentence
had
been
pronounced
by
pilate
christ
was
about
to
be
dragged
past
his
house
then
he
ran
home
and
called
together
his
household
to
have
a
look
at
christ
and
see
what
sort
of
a
person
he
was
this
having
been
done
he
had
his
little
child
on
his
arm
and
was
standing
in
his
doorway
to
have
a
sight
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
as
then
christ
was
led
by
bowed
under
the
weight
of
the
heavy
cross
he
tried
to
rest
a
little
and
stood
still
a
moment
but
the
shoemaker
in
zeal
and
rage
and
for
the
sake
of
obtaining
credit
among
the
other
jews
drove
the
lord
christ
forward
and
told
him
to
hasten
on
his
way
jesus
obeying
looked
at
him
and
said
shall
stand
and
rest
but
thou
shalt
go
till
the
last
day
at
these
words
the
man
set
down
the
child
and
unable
to
remain
where
he
was
he
followed
christ
and
saw
how
cruelly
he
was
crucified
how
he
suffered
how
he
died
as
soon
as
this
had
taken
place
it
came
upon
him
suddenly
that
he
could
no
more
return
to
jerusalem
nor
see
again
his
wife
and
child
but
must
go
forth
into
foreign
lands
one
after
another
like
a
mournful
pilgrim
now
when
years
after
he
returned
to
jerusalem
he
found
it
ruined
and
utterly
razed
so
that
not
one
stone
was
left
standing
on
another
and
he
could
not
recognize
former
localities
he
believes
that
it
is
god
purpose
in
thus
driving
him
about
in
miserable
life
and
preserving
him
undying
to
present
him
before
the
jews
at
the
end
as
a
living
token
so
that
the
godless
and
unbelieving
may
remember
the
death
of
christ
and
be
turned
to
repentance
for
his
part
he
would
well
rejoice
were
god
in
heaven
to
release
him
from
this
vale
of
tears
after
this
conversation
doctor
paul
eitzen
along
with
the
rector
of
the
school
of
hamburg
who
was
well
read
in
history
and
a
traveller
questioned
him
about
events
which
had
taken
place
in
the
east
since
the
death
of
christ
and
he
was
able
to
give
them
much
information
on
many
ancient
matters
so
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
be
convinced
of
the
truth
of
his
story
and
to
see
that
what
seems
impossible
with
men
is
after
all
possible
with
god
since
the
jew
has
had
his
life
extended
he
has
become
silent
and
reserved
and
only
answers
direct
questions
when
invited
to
become
any
one
guest
he
eats
little
and
drinks
in
great
moderation
then
hurries
on
never
remaining
long
in
one
place
when
at
hamburg
dantzig
and
elsewhere
money
has
been
offered
him
he
never
took
more
than
two
skillings
fourpence
one
farthing
and
at
once
distributed
it
to
the
poor
as
token
that
he
needed
no
money
for
god
would
provide
for
him
as
he
rued
the
sins
he
had
committed
in
ignorance
during
the
period
of
his
stay
in
hamburg
and
dantzig
he
was
never
seen
to
laugh
in
whatever
land
he
travelled
he
spoke
its
language
and
when
he
spoke
saxon
it
was
like
a
native
saxon
many
people
came
from
different
places
to
hamburg
and
dantzig
in
order
to
see
and
hear
this
man
and
were
convinced
that
the
providence
of
god
was
exercised
in
this
individual
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
he
gladly
listened
to
god
word
or
heard
it
spoken
of
always
with
great
gravity
and
compunction
and
he
ever
reverenced
with
sighs
the
pronunciation
of
the
name
of
god
or
of
jesus
christ
and
could
not
endure
to
hear
curses
but
whenever
he
heard
any
one
swear
by
god
death
or
pains
he
waxed
indignant
and
exclaimed
with
vehemence
and
with
sighs
man
and
miserable
creature
thus
to
misuse
the
name
of
thy
lord
and
god
and
his
bitter
sufferings
and
passion
hadst
thou
seen
as
i
have
how
heavy
and
bitter
were
the
pangs
and
wounds
of
thy
lord
endured
for
thee
and
for
me
thou
wouldst
rather
undergo
great
pain
thyself
than
thus
take
his
sacred
name
in
vain
such
is
the
account
given
to
me
by
doctor
paul
von
eitzen
with
many
circumstantial
proofs
and
corroborated
by
certain
of
my
own
old
acquaintances
who
saw
this
same
individual
with
their
own
eyes
in
hamburg
in
the
year
the
secretary
christopher
krause
and
master
jacob
von
holstein
legates
to
the
court
of
spain
and
afterwards
sent
into
the
netherlands
to
pay
the
soldiers
serving
his
majesty
in
that
country
related
on
their
return
home
to
schleswig
and
confirmed
with
solemn
oaths
that
they
had
come
across
the
same
mysterious
individual
at
madrid
in
spain
in
appearance
manner
of
life
habits
clothing
just
the
same
as
he
had
appeared
in
hamburg
they
said
that
they
had
spoken
with
him
and
that
many
people
of
all
classes
had
conversed
with
him
and
found
him
to
speak
good
spanish
in
the
year
in
december
a
reliable
person
wrote
from
brunswick
to
strasburg
that
the
same
mentioned
strange
person
had
been
seen
alive
at
vienna
in
austria
and
that
he
had
started
for
poland
and
dantzig
and
that
he
purposed
going
on
to
moscow
this
ahasverus
was
at
lubeck
in
also
about
the
same
date
in
revel
in
livonia
and
in
cracow
in
poland
in
moscow
he
was
seen
of
many
and
spoken
to
by
many
what
thoughtful
persons
are
to
think
of
the
said
person
is
at
their
option
god
works
are
wondrous
and
past
finding
out
and
are
manifested
day
by
day
only
to
be
revealed
in
full
at
the
last
great
day
of
account
dated
revel
august
chrysostomus
dudulœus
westphalus
the
statement
that
the
wandering
jew
appeared
in
lubeck
in
does
not
tally
with
the
more
precise
chronicle
of
henricus
bangert
which
gives
die

lubecæ
fuisse
judæum
illum
immortalem
qui

in
he
seems
to
have
appeared
in
paris
rudolph
botoreus
says
under
this
date
i
fear
lest
i
be
accused
of
giving
ear
to
old
fables
if
i
insert
in
these
pages
what
is
reported
all
over
europe
of
the
jew
coeval
with
the
savior
christ
however
nothing
is
more
common
and
our
popular
histories
have
not
scrupled
to
assert
it
following
the
lead
of
those
who
wrote
our
annals
i
may
say
that
he
who
appeared
not
in
one
century
only
in
spain
italy
and
germany
was
also
in
this
year
seen
and
recognized
as
the
same
individual
who
had
appeared
in
hamburg
anno
mdlxvi
the
common
people
bold
in
spreading
reports
relate
many
things
of
him
and
this
i
allude
to
lest
anything
should
be
left
unsaid
bulenger
puts
the
date
of
the
hamburg
visit
earlier
it
was
reported
at
this
time
that
a
jew
of
the
time
of
christ
was
wandering
without
food
and
drink
having
for
a
thousand
and
odd
years
been
a
vagabond
and
outcast
condemned
by
god
to
rove
because
he
of
that
generation
of
vipers
was
the
first
to
cry
out
for
the
crucifixion
of
christ
and
the
release
of
barabbas
and
also
because
soon
after
when
christ
panting
under
the
burden
of
the
rood
sought
to
rest
before
his
workshop
he
was
a
cobbler
the
fellow
ordered
him
off
with
acerbity
thereupon
christ
replied
thou
grudgest
me
such
a
moment
of
rest
i
shall
enter
into
my
rest
but
thou
shalt
wander
restless
at
once
frantic
and
agitated
he
fled
through
the
whole
earth
and
on
the
same
account
to
this
day
he
journeys
through
the
world
it
was
this
person
who
was
seen
in
hamburg
in
mdlxiv
credat
judæus
apella
did
not
see
him
or
hear
anything
authentic
concerning
him
at
that
time
when
i
was
in
paris
a
curious
little
book
written
against
the
quackery
of
paracelsus
by
leonard
doldius
a
nürnberg
physician
and
translated
into
latin
and
augmented
by
andreas
libavius
doctor
and
physician
of
rotenburg
alludes
to
the
same
story
and
gives
the
jew
a
new
name
nowhere
else
met
with
after
having
referred
to
a
report
that
paracelsus
was
not
dead
but
was
seated
alive
asleep
or
napping
in
his
sepulchre
at
strasburg
preserved
from
death
by
some
of
his
specifics
libavius
declares
that
he
would
sooner
believe
in
the
old
man
the
jew
ahasverus
wandering
over
the
world
called
by
some
buttadæus
and
otherwise
again
by
others
he
is
said
to
have
appeared
in
naumburg
but
the
date
is
not
given
he
was
noticed
in
church
listening
to
the
sermon
after
the
service
he
was
questioned
and
he
related
his
story
on
this
occasion
he
received
presents
from
the
burgers
in
he
was
again
in
hamburg
in
the
year
two
citizens
living
in
the
gerberstrasse
in
brussels
were
walking
in
the
sonian
wood
when
they
encountered
an
aged
man
whose
clothes
were
in
tatters
and
of
an
antiquated
appearance
they
invited
him
to
go
with
them
to
a
house
of
refreshment
and
he
went
with
them
but
would
not
seat
himself
remaining
on
foot
to
drink
when
he
came
before
the
doors
with
the
two
burgers
he
told
them
a
great
deal
but
they
were
mostly
stories
of
events
which
had
happened
many
hundred
years
before
hence
the
burgers
gathered
that
their
companion
was
isaac
laquedem
the
jew
who
had
refused
to
permit
our
blessed
lord
to
rest
for
a
moment
at
his
and
they
left
him
full
of
terror
in
he
is
reported
to
have
visited
leipzig
on
the
july
he
appeared
at
the
gates
of
the
city
of
munich
about
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
or
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
an
impostor
calling
himself
the
wandering
jew
attracted
attention
in
england
and
was
listened
to
by
the
ignorant
and
despised
by
the
educated
he
however
managed
to
thrust
himself
into
the
notice
of
the
nobility
who
half
in
jest
half
in
curiosity
questioned
him
and
paid
him
as
they
might
a
juggler
he
declared
that
he
had
been
an
officer
of
the
sanhedrim
and
that
he
had
struck
christ
as
he
left
the
judgment
hall
of
pilate
he
remembered
all
the
apostles
and
described
their
personal
appearance
their
clothes
and
their
peculiarities
he
spoke
many
languages
claimed
the
power
of
healing
the
sick
and
asserted
that
he
had
travelled
nearly
all
over
the
world
those
who
heard
him
were
perplexed
by
his
familiarity
with
foreign
tongues
and
places
oxford
and
cambridge
sent
professors
to
question
him
and
to
discover
the
imposition
if
any
an
english
nobleman
conversed
with
him
in
arabic
the
mysterious
stranger
told
his
questioner
in
that
language
that
historical
works
were
not
to
be
relied
upon
and
on
being
asked
his
opinion
of
mahomet
he
replied
that
he
had
been
acquainted
with
the
father
of
the
prophet
and
that
he
dwelt
at
ormuz
as
for
mahomet
he
believed
him
to
have
been
a
man
of
intelligence
once
when
he
heard
the
prophet
deny
that
christ
was
crucified
he
answered
abruptly
by
telling
him
he
was
a
witness
to
the
truth
of
that
event
he
related
also
that
he
was
in
rome
when
nero
set
it
on
fire
he
had
known
saladin
tamerlane
bajazeth
eterlane
and
could
give
minute
details
of
the
history
of
the
crusades
whether
this
wandering
jew
was
found
out
in
london
or
not
we
can
not
tell
but
he
shortly
after
appeared
in
denmark
thence
travelled
into
sweden
and
vanished
such
are
the
principal
notices
of
the
wandering
jew
which
have
appeared
it
will
be
seen
at
once
how
wanting
they
are
in
all
substantial
evidence
which
could
make
us
regard
the
story
in
any
other
light
than
myth
but
no
myth
is
wholly
without
foundation
and
there
must
be
some
substantial
verity
upon
which
this
vast
superstructure
of
legend
has
been
raised
what
that
is
i
am
unable
to
discover
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
that
the
jew
ahasverus
is
an
impersonation
of
that
race
which
wanders
over
the
earth
with
the
brand
of
a
brother
blood
upon
it
and
one
which
is
not
to
pass
away
till
all
be
fulfilled
not
to
be
reconciled
to
its
angered
god
till
the
times
of
the
gentiles
are
accomplished
and
yet
probable
as
this
supposition
may
seem
at
first
sight
it
is
not
to
be
harmonized
with
some
of
the
leading
features
of
the
story
the
shoemaker
becomes
a
penitent
and
earnest
christian
whilst
the
jewish
nation
has
still
the
veil
upon
its
heart
the
wretched
wanderer
eschews
money
and
the
avarice
of
the
israelite
is
proverbial
according
to
local
legend
he
is
identified
with
the
gypsies
or
rather
that
strange
people
are
supposed
to
be
living
under
a
curse
somewhat
similar
to
that
inflicted
on
ahasverus
because
they
refused
shelter
to
the
virgin
and
child
on
their
flight
into
egypt
another
tradition
connects
the
jew
with
the
wild
huntsman
and
there
is
a
forest
at
bretten
in
swabia
which
he
is
said
to
haunt
popular
superstition
attributes
to
him
there
a
purse
containing
a
groschen
which
as
often
as
it
is
expended
returns
to
the
spender
in
the
harz
one
form
of
the
wild
huntsman
myth
is
to
this
effect
that
he
was
a
jew
who
had
refused
to
suffer
our
blessed
lord
to
drink
out
of
a
river
or
out
of
a
but
had
contemptuously
pointed
out
to
him
the
of
a
horse
in
which
a
little
water
had
collected
and
had
bid
him
quench
his
thirst
thence
as
the
wild
huntsman
is
the
personification
of
the
storm
it
is
curious
to
find
in
parts
of
france
that
the
sudden
roar
of
a
gale
at
night
is
attributed
by
the
vulgar
to
the
passing
of
the
everlasting
jew
a
swiss
story
is
that
he
was
seen
one
day
standing
upon
the
matterberg
which
is
below
the
matterhorn
contemplating
the
scene
with
mingled
sorrow
and
wonder
once
before
he
stood
on
that
spot
and
then
it
was
the
site
of
a
flourishing
city
now
it
is
covered
with
gentian
and
wild
pinks
once
again
will
he
revisit
the
hill
and
that
will
be
on
the
eve
of
judgment
perhaps
of
all
the
myths
which
originated
in
the
middle
ages
none
is
more
striking
than
that
we
have
been
considering
indeed
there
is
something
so
calculated
to
arrest
the
attention
and
to
excite
the
imagination
in
the
outline
of
the
story
that
it
is
remarkable
that
we
should
find
an
interval
of
three
centuries
elapse
between
its
first
introduction
into
europe
by
matthew
paris
and
philip
mouskes
and
its
general
acceptance
in
the
sixteenth
century
as
a
myth
its
roots
lie
in
that
great
mystery
of
human
life
which
is
an
enigma
never
solved
and
ever
originating
speculation
what
was
life
was
it
of
necessity
limited
to
fourscore
years
or
could
it
be
extended
indefinitely
were
questions
curious
minds
never
wearied
of
asking
and
so
the
mythology
of
the
past
teemed
with
legends
of
favored
or
accursed
mortals
who
had
reached
beyond
the
term
of
days
set
to
most
men
some
had
discovered
the
water
of
life
the
fountain
of
perpetual
youth
and
were
ever
renewing
their
strength
others
had
dared
the
power
of
god
and
were
therefore
sentenced
to
feel
the
weight
of
his
displeasure
without
tasting
the
repose
of
death
john

divine

at

untouched
by
corruption

about

of

century
a
rumor
circulated
through
europe
that
there
reigned
in
asia
a
powerful
christian
emperor
presbyter
johannes
in
a
bloody
fight
he
had
broken
the
power
of
the
mussulmans
and
was
ready
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
crusaders
great
was
the
exultation
in
europe
for
of
late
the
news
from
the
east
had
been
gloomy
and
depressing
the
power
of
the
infidel
had
increased
overwhelming
masses
of
men
had
been
brought
into
the
field
against
the
chivalry
of
christendom
and
it
was
felt
that
the
cross
must
yield
before
the
odious
crescent
the
news
of
the
success
of
the
opened
a
door
of
hope
to
the
desponding
christian
world
pope
alexander
iii
determined
at
once
to
effect
a
union
with
this
mysterious
personage
and
on
the
of
september
wrote
him
a
letter
which
he
intrusted
to
his
physician
philip
to
deliver
in
person
philip
started
on
his
embassy
but
never
returned
the
conquests
of
again
attracted
the
eyes
of
christian
europe
to
the
east
the
mongol
hordes
were
rushing
in
upon
the
west
with
devastating
ferocity
russia
poland
hungary
and
the
eastern
provinces
of
germany
had
succumbed
or
suffered
grievously
and
the
fears
of
other
nations
were
roused
lest
they
too
should
taste
the
misery
of
a
mongolian
invasion
it
was
gog
and
magog
come
to
slaughter
and
the
times
of
antichrist
were
dawning
but
the
battle
of
liegnitz
stayed
them
in
their
onward
career
and
europe
was
saved
pope
innocent
iv
determined
to
convert
these
wild
hordes
of
barbarians
and
subject
them
to
the
cross
of
christ
he
therefore
sent
among
them
a
number
of
dominican
and
franciscan
missioners
and
embassies
of
peace
passed
between
the
pope
the
king
of
france
and
the
mogul
khan
the
result
of
these
communications
with
the
east
was
that
the
travellers
learned
how
false
were
the
prevalent
notions
of
a
mighty
christian
empire
existing
in
central
asia
vulgar
superstition
or
conviction
is
not
however
to
be
upset
by
evidence
and
the
locality
of
the
monarchy
was
merely
transferred
by
the
people
to
africa
and
they
fixed
upon
abyssinia
with
a
show
of
truth
as
the
seat
of
the
famous
however
still
some
doubted
john
de
plano
carpini
and
marco
polo
though
they
acknowledged
the
existence
of
a
christian
monarch
in
abyssinia
yet
stoutly
maintained
as
well
that
the
prester
john
of
popular
belief
reigned
in
splendor
somewhere
in
the
dim
orient
but
before
proceeding
with
the
history
of
this
strange
fable
it
will
be
well
to
extract
the
different
accounts
given
of
the
and
his
realm
by
early
writers
and
we
shall
then
be
better
able
to
judge
of
the
influence
the
myth
obtained
in
europe
otto
of
freisingen
is
the
first
author
to
mention
the
monarchy
of
prester
john
with
whom
we
are
acquainted
otto
wrote
a
chronicle
up
to
the
date
and
he
relates
that
in
the
catholic
bishop
of
cabala
visited
europe
to
lay
certain
complaints
before
the
pope
he
mentioned
the
fall
of
edessa
and
also
he
stated
that
a
few
years
ago
a
certain
king
and
priest
called
john
who
lives
on
the
farther
side
of
persia
and
armenia
in
the
remote
east
and
who
with
all
his
people
were
christians
though
belonging
to
the
nestorian
church
had
overcome
the
royal
brothers
samiardi
kings
of
the
medes
and
persians
and
had
captured
ecbatana
their
capital
and
residence
the
said
kings
had
met
with
their
persian
median
and
assyrian
troops
and
had
fought
for
three
consecutive
days
each
side
having
determined
to
die
rather
than
take
to
flight
prester
john
for
so
they
are
wont
to
call
him
at
length
routed
the
persians
and
after
a
bloody
battle
remained
victorious
after
which
victory
the
said
john
was
hastening
to
the
assistance
of
the
church
at
jerusalem
but
his
host
on
reaching
the
tigris
was
hindered
from
passing
through
a
deficiency
in
boats
and
he
directed
his
march
north
since
he
had
heard
that
the
river
was
there
covered
with
ice
in
that
place
he
had
waited
many
years
expecting
severe
cold
but
the
winters
having
proved
unpropitious
and
the
severity
of
the
climate
having
carried
off
many
soldiers
he
had
been
forced
to
retreat
to
his
own
land
this
king
belongs
to
the
family
of
the
magi
mentioned
in
the
gospel
and
he
rules
over
the
very
people
formerly
governed
by
the
magi
moreover
his
fame
and
his
wealth
are
so
great
that
he
uses
an
emerald
sceptre
only
excited
by
the
example
of
his
ancestors
who
came
to
worship
christ
in
his
cradle
he
had
proposed
to
go
to
jerusalem
but
had
been
impeded
by
the
causes
at
the
same
time
the
story
crops
up
in
other
quarters
so
that
we
can
not
look
upon
otto
as
the
inventor
of
the
myth
the
celebrated
maimonides
alludes
to
it
in
a
passage
quoted
by
joshua
lorki
a
jewish
physician
to
benedict
xiii
maimonides
lived
from
to
the
passage
is
as
follows
it
is
evident
both
from
the
letters
of
rambam
maimonides
whose
memory
be
blessed
and
from
the
narration
of
merchants
who
have
visited
the
ends
of
the
earth
that
at
this
time
the
root
of
our
faith
is
to
be
found
in
the
lands
of
babel
and
teman
where
long
ago
jerusalem
was
an
exile
not
reckoning
those
who
live
in
the
land
of
paras
and
madai
of
the
exiles
of
schomrom
the
number
of
which
people
is
as
the
sand
of
these
some
are
still
under
the
yoke
of
paras
who
is
called
the
sultan
by
the
arabs
others
live
in
a
place
under
the
yoke
of
a
strange
people
governed
by
a
christian
chief
by
name
with
him
they
have
made
a
compact
and
he
with
them
and
this
is
a
matter
concerning
which
there
can
be
no
manner
of
doubt
benjamin
of
tudela
another
jew
travelled
in
the
east
between
the
years
and
the
last
being
the
date
of
his
death
he
wrote
an
account
of
his
travels
and
gives
in
it
some
information
with
regard
to
a
mythical
jew
king
who
reigned
in
the
utmost
splendor
over
a
realm
inhabited
by
jews
alone
situate
somewhere
in
the
midst
of
a
desert
of
vast
extent
about
this
period
there
appeared
a
document
which
produced
intense
excitement
throughout
europe
a
letter
yes
a
letter
from
the
mysterious
personage
himself
to
manuel
comnenus
emperor
of
constantinople
the
exact
date
of
this
extraordinary
epistle
can
not
be
fixed
with
any
certainty
but
it
certainly
appeared
before
the
date
of
the
conclusion
of
the
chronicle
of
albericus
trium
fontium
this
albericus
relates
that
in
the
year
presbyter
joannes
the
indian
king
sent
his
wonderful
letter
to
various
christian
princes
and
especially
to
manuel
of
constantinople
and
frederic
the
roman
emperor
similar
letters
were
sent
to
alexander
to
louis
vii
of
france
and
to
the
king
of
portugal
which
are
alluded
to
in
chronicles
and
romances
and
which
were
indeed
turned
into
rhyme
and
sung
all
over
europe
by
minstrels
and
trouvères
the
letter
is
as

stands
four

men
watch
by
it

ask
the
comers
whether
they
are
christians

are
about
to

christians
then
whether
they
desire
healing

they

they
are
bidden
to
lay
aside
their

to

if
what
they
said
be
true
then
the

gush
over

the

the

obtain
thence

they
never

we

these

further
extracts
from
this
extraordinary
letter
which
proceeds
to
describe
the
church
in
which
prester
john
worships
by
enumerating
the
precious
stones
of
which
it
is
constructed
and
their
special
virtues
whether
this
letter
was
in
circulation
before
pope
alexander
wrote
his
it
is
not
easy
to
decide
alexander
does
not
allude
to
it
but
speaks
of
the
reports
which
have
reached
him
of
the
piety
and
the
magnificence
of
the
at
the
same
time
there
runs
a
tone
of
bitterness
through
the
letter
as
though
the
pope
had
been
galled
at
the
pretensions
of
this
mysterious
personage
and
perhaps
winced
under
the
prospect
of
the
overrunning
italy
as
suggested
by
john
the
priest
the
papal
epistle
is
an
assertion
of
the
claims
of
the
see
of
rome
to
universal
dominion
and
it
assures
the
eastern
that
his
christian
professions
are
worthless
unless
he
submits
to
the
successor
of
peter
not
every
one
that
saith
unto
me
lord
lord
quotes
the
pope
and
then
explains
that
the
will
of
god
is
that
every
monarch
and
prelate
should
eat
humble
pie
to
the
sovereign
pontiff
sir
john
maundevil
gives
the
origin
of
the
priestly
title
of
the
eastern
despot
in
his
curious
book
of
travels
so
it
befelle
that
this
emperour
cam
with
a
cristene
knyght
with
him
into
a
chirche
in
egypt
and
it
was
saterday
in
wyttson
woke
and
the
bishop
made
orders
and
he
beheld
and
listened
the
servyse
fulle
tentyfly
and
he
asked
the
cristene
knyght
what
men
of
degree
thei
scholden
ben
that
the
prelate
had
before
him
and
the
knyght
answerede
and
seyde
that
thei
scholde
ben
prestes
and
then
the
emperour
seyde
that
he
wolde
no
longer
ben
clept
kyng
ne
emperour
but
preest
and
that
he
wolde
have
the
name
of
the
first
preest
that
wente
out
of
the
chirche
and
his
name
was
john
and
so
evere
more
sittiens
he
is
clept
prestre
john
it
is
probable
that
the
foundation
of
the
whole
myth
lay
in
the
report
which
reached
europe
of
the
wonderful
successes
of
nestorianism
in
the
east
and
there
seems
reason
to
believe
that
the
famous
letter
given
above
was
a
nestorian
fabrication
it
certainly
looks
the
gorgeous
imagery
is
thoroughly
eastern
and
the
disparaging
tone
in
which
rome
is
spoken
of
could
hardly
have
been
the
expression
of
western
feelings
the
letter
has
the
object
in
view
of
exalting
the
east
in
religion
and
arts
to
an
undue
eminence
at
the
expense
of
the
west
and
it
manifests
some
ignorance
of
european
geography
when
it
speaks
of
the
land
extending
from
spain
to
the
polar
sea
moreover
the
sites
of
the
patriarchates
and
the
dignity
conferred
on
that
of
thomas
are
indications
of
a
nestorian
bias
a
brief
glance
at
the
history
of
this
heretical
church
may
be
of
value
here
as
showing
that
there
really
was
a
foundation
for
the
wild
legends
concerning
a
christian
empire
in
the
east
so
prevalent
in
europe
nestorius
a
priest
of
antioch
and
a
disciple
of
chrysostom
was
elevated
by
the
emperor
to
the
patriarchate
of
constantinople
and
in
the
year
began
to
propagate
his
heresy
denying
the
hypostatic
union
the
council
of
ephesus
denounced
him
and
in
spite
of
the
emperor
and
court
nestorius
was
anathematized
and
driven
into
exile
his
sect
spread
through
the
east
and
became
a
flourishing
church
it
reached
to
china
where
the
emperor
was
all
but
converted
its
missionaries
traversed
the
frozen
tundras
of
siberia
preaching
their
maimed
gospel
to
the
wild
hordes
which
haunted
those
dreary
wastes
it
faced
buddhism
and
wrestled
with
it
for
the
religious
supremacy
in
thibet
it
established
churches
in
persia
and
in
bokhara
it
penetrated
india
it
formed
colonies
in
ceylon
in
siam
and
in
sumatra
so
that
the
catholicos
or
pope
of
bagdad
exercised
sway
more
extensive
than
that
ever
obtained
by
the
successor
of
peter
the
number
of
christians
belonging
to
that
communion
probably
exceeded
that
of
the
members
of
the
true
catholic
church
in
east
and
west
but
the
nestorian
church
was
not
founded
on
the
rock
it
rested
on
nestorius
and
when
the
rain
descended
and
the
winds
blew
and
the
floods
came
and
beat
upon
that
house
it
fell
leaving
scarce
a
fragment
behind
rubruquis
the
franciscan
who
in
was
sent
on
a
mission
into
tartary
was
the
first
to
let
in
a
little
light
on
the
fable
he
writes
the
catai
dwelt
beyond
certain
mountains
across
which
i
wandered
and
in
a
plain
in
the
midst
of
the
mountains
lived
once
an
important
nestorian
shepherd
who
ruled
over
the
nestorian
people
called
nayman
when
died
the
nestorian
people
raised
this
man
to
be
king
and
called
him
king
johannes
and
related
of
him
ten
times
as
much
as
the
truth
the
nestorians
thereabouts
have
this
way
with
them
that
about
nothing
they
make
a
great
fuss
and
thus
they
have
got
it
noised
abroad
that
sartach
and
were
christians
simply
because
they
treated
christians
well
and
showed
them
more
honor
than
other
people
yet
in
fact
they
were
not
christians
at
all
and
in
like
manner
the
story
got
about
that
there
was
a
great
king
john
however
i
traversed
his
pastures
and
no
one
knew
anything
about
him
except
a
few
nestorians
in
his
pastures
lives
at
whose
court
was
brother
andrew
whom
i
met
on
my
way
back
this
johannes
had
a
brother
a
famous
shepherd
named
unc
who
lived
three
weeks
journey
beyond
the
mountains
of
caracatais
this
was
a
real
individual
he
lost
his
life
in
the
year
kuschhik
prince
of
the
nayman
and
follower
of
fell
in
marco
polo
the
venetian
traveller
identifies
with
prester
john
he
says
i
will
now
tell
you
of
the
deeds
of
the
tartars
how
they
gained
the
mastery
and
spread
over
the
whole
earth
the
tartars
dwelt
between
georgia
and
bargu
where
there
is
a
vast
plain
and
level
country
on
which
are
neither
cities
nor
forts
but
capital
pasturage
and
water
they
had
no
chief
of
their
own
but
paid
to
prester
johannes
tribute
of
the
greatness
of
this
prester
johannes
who
was
properly
called
the
whole
world
spake
the
tartars
gave
him
one
of
every
ten
head
of
cattle
when
prester
john
noticed
that
they
were
increasing
he
feared
them
and
planned
how
he
could
injure
them
he
determined
therefore
to
scatter
them
and
he
sent
barons
to
do
this
but
the
tartars
guessed
what
prester
john
purposed
and
they
went
away
into
the
wide
wastes
of
the
north
where
they
might
be
beyond
his
reach
he
then
goes
on
to
relate
how
khan
became
the
head
of
the
tartars
and
how
he
fought
against
prester
john
and
after
a
desperate
fight
overcame
and
slew
him
the
syriac
chronicle
of
the
jacobite
primate
gregory
born
died
also
identifies
with
prester
john
in
the
year
of
the
greeks
of
the
arabs
when
who
is
the
christian
king
john
ruled
over
a
stock
of
the
barbarian
hunns
called
kergt
served
him
with
great
zeal
when
john
observed
the
superiority
and
serviceableness
of
the
other
he
envied
him
and
plotted
to
seize
and
murder
him
but
two
sons
of
having
heard
this
told
it
to
tschingys
whereupon
he
and
his
comrades
fled
by
night
and
secreted
themselves
next
morning
took
possession
of
the
tartar
tents
but
found
them
empty
then
the
party
of
tschingys
fell
upon
him
and
they
met
by
the
spring
called
balschunah
and
the
side
of
tschingys
won
the
day
and
the
followers
of
were
compelled
to
yield
they
met
again
several
times
till
was
utterly
discomfited
and
was
slain
himself
and
his
wives
sons
and
daughters
carried
into
captivity
yet
we
must
consider
that
king
john
the
kergtajer
was
not
cast
down
for
nought
nay
rather
because
he
had
turned
his
heart
from
the
fear
of
christ
his
lord
who
had
exalted
him
and
had
taken
a
wife
of
the
zinish
nation
called
quarakhata
because
he
forsook
the
religion
of
his
ancestors
and
followed
strange
gods
therefore
god
took
the
government
from
him
and
gave
it
to
one
better
than
he
and
whose
heart
was
right
before
god
some
of
the
early
travellers
such
as
john
de
plano
carpini
and
marco
polo
in
disabusing
the
popular
mind
of
the
belief
in
prester
john
as
a
mighty
asiatic
christian
monarch
unintentionally
turned
the
popular
faith
in
that
individual
into
a
new
direction
they
spoke
of
the
black
people
of
abascia
in
ethiopia
which
by
the
way
they
called
middle
india
as
a
great
people
subject
to
a
christian
monarch
marco
polo
says
that
the
true
monarch
of
abyssinia
is
christ
but
that
it
is
governed
by
six
kings
three
of
whom
are
christians
and
three
saracens
and
that
they
are
in
league
with
the
soudan
of
aden
bishop
jordanus
in
his
description
of
the
world
accordingly
sets
down
abyssinia
as
the
kingdom
of
prester
john
and
such
was
the
popular
impression
which
was
confirmed
by
the
appearance
at
intervals
of
ambassadors
at
european
courts
from
the
king
of
abyssinia
the
discovery
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
due
partly
to
a
desire
manifested
in
portugal
to
open
communications
with
this
monarch
and
king
john
ii
sent
two
men
learned
in
oriental
languages
through
egypt
to
the
court
of
abyssinia
the
might
and
dominion
of
this
prince
who
had
replaced
the
tartar
chief
in
the
popular
creed
as
prester
john
was
of
course
greatly
exaggerated
and
was
supposed
to
extend
across
arabia
and
asia
to
the
wall
of
china
the
spread
of
geographical
knowledge
has
contracted
the
area
of
his
dominions
and
a
critical
acquaintance
with
history
has
exploded
the
myth
which
invested
the
nomad
chief
with
all
the
attributes
of
a
demigod
uniting
in
one
the
utmost
pretensions
of
a
pope
and
the
proudest
claims
of
a
monarch

a
rod
has
been
regarded
as

authority

it
in

and

works
his

before

with
the

as

his

to
it

all
that
is
needful

probably
it
is
to
this
rod

us
that
the

practised
some
sort
of
divination
by

of
rods
for
the
purpose
their
method
is
simple
they
cut
a
rod
off
some
into
bits
and
after
having
distinguished
them
by
various
marks
they
cast
them
into
a
white

the

piece

ordered
that
the

should
be
made

these

should
be
laid

on
the
sacred

was
to

supplicated
to

this
was
called
the
lot

the

but
the
middle
ages
was
the
date
of
the
full
development

to
have

andreas
libavius
a
writer
i
have
already
quoted
in
my
article
on
the
wandering
jew
undertook
a
series
of
experiments
upon
the
hazel
divining
rod
and
concluded
that
there
was
truth
in
the
popular
belief
the
jesuit
kircher
also
experimentalized
several
times
on
wooden
rods
which
were
declared
to
be
sympathetic
with
regard
to
certain
metals
by
placing
them
on
delicate
pivots
in
equilibrium
but
they
never
turned
on
the
approach
of

however
a
similar
course
of
experiments
over
water
led
him
to
attribute
to
the
rod
the
power
of
indicating
subterranean
springs
and
i
would
not
affirm
it
he
says
unless
i
had
established
the
fact

my
own
experience
dechales
another
jesuit
author
of
a
treatise
on
natural
springs
and
of
a
huge
tome
entitled
mundus
mathematicus
declared
in
the
latter
work
that
no
means
of
discovering
sources
is
equal
to
the
divining
rod
and
he
quotes
a
friend
of
his
who
with
a
hazel
rod
in
his
hand
could
discover
springs
with
the
utmost
precision
and
facility
and
could
trace
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
the
course
of
a
subterranean
conduit
another
writer
in
his
science
dégagée
des
chimères
de
exclaims
is
it
not
astonishing
to
see
a
rod
which
is
held
firmly
in
the
hands
bow
itself
and
turn
visibly
in
the
direction
of
water
or
metal
with
more
or
less
promptitude
according
as
the
metal
or
the
water
are
near
or
remote
from
the
surface
in
the
jesuit
gaspard
schott
writes
that
the
rod
is
used
in
every
town
of
germany
and
that
he
had
frequent
opportunity
of
seeing
it
used
in
the
discovery
of
hidden
treasures
i
searched
with
the
greatest
care
he
adds
into
the
question
whether
the
hazel
rod
had
any
sympathy
with
gold
and
silver
and
whether
any
natural
property
set
it
in
motion
in
like
manner
i
tried
whether
a
ring
of
metal
held
suspended
by
a
thread
in
the
midst
of
a
tumbler
and
which
strikes
the
hours
is
moved
by
any
similar
force
i
ascertained
that
these
effects
could
only
have
rise
from
the
deception
of
those
holding
the
rod
or
the
pendulum
or
may
be
from
some
diabolic
impulsion

more
likely
still

he
gives
an
account
of
a
trial
made
with
the
rod
in
the
presence
of
father
jean
françois
who
had
ridiculed
the
operation
in
his
treatise
on
the
science

published
at

in
and
which
succeeded
in
convincing
the
blasphemer
of
the
divine
rod
le

denies
to
it
the
power
of
picking
out
criminals
which
had
been
popularly
attributed
to
it
and
as
had
been
unhesitatingly
claimed
for
it
by
debrio
in
his
disquisitio
magica
and
now
i
am
brought
to
the
extraordinary
story
of
jacques
aymar
which
attracted
the
attention
of
europe
to
the
marvellous
properties
of
the
divining
rod
i
shall
give
the
history
of
this
man
in
full
as
such
an
account
is
rendered
necessary
by
the
mutilated
versions
i
have
seen
current
in
english
magazine
articles
which
follow
the
lead
of
crowe
who
narrates
the
earlier
portion
of
this
career
but
says
nothing
of
his
and
downfall
on
the
july
at
about
ten
in
the
evening
a
of
lyons
and
his
wife
were
assassinated
in
their
cellar
and
their
money
carried
off
on
the
morrow
the
officers
of
justice
arrived
and
examined
the
premises
beside
the
corpses
lay
a
large
bottle
wrapped
in
straw
and
a
bloody
hedging
bill
which
undoubtedly
had
been
the
instrument
used
to
accomplish
the
murder
not
a
trace
of
those
who
had
committed
the
horrible
deed
was
to
be
found
and
the
magistrates
were
quite
at
fault
as
to
the
direction
in
which
they
should
turn
for
a
clew
to
the
murderer
or
murderers
at
this
juncture
a
neighbor
reminded
the
magistrates
of
an
incident
which
had
taken
place
four
years
previous
it
was
this
in
a
theft
of
clothes
had
been
made
in
grenoble
in
the
parish
of
crôle
lived
a
man
named
jacques
aymar
supposed
to
be
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
using
the
divining
rod
this
man
was
sent
for
on
reaching
the
spot
where
the
theft
had
been
committed
his
rod
moved
in
his
hand
he
followed
the
track
indicated
by
the
rod
and
it
continued
to
rotate
between
his
fingers
as
long
as
he
followed
a
certain
direction
but
ceased
to
turn
if
he
diverged
from
it
in
the
smallest
degree
guided
by
his
rod
aymar
went
from
street
to
street
till
he
was
brought
to
a
standstill
before
the
prison
gates
these
could
not
be
opened
without
leave
of
the
magistrate
who
hastened
to
witness
the
experiment
the
gates
were
unlocked
and
aymar
under
the
same
guidance
directed
his
steps
towards
four
prisoners
lately
incarcerated
he
ordered
the
four
to
be
stood
in
a
line
and
then
he
placed
his
foot
on
that
of
the
first
the
rod
remained
immovable
he
passed
to
the
second
and
the
rod
turned
at
once
before
the
third
prisoner
there
were
no
signs
the
fourth
trembled
and
begged
to
be
heard
he
owned
himself
the
thief
along
with
the
second
who
also
acknowledged
the
theft
and
mentioned
the
name
of
the
receiver
of
the
stolen
goods
this
was
a
farmer
in
the
neighborhood
of
grenoble
the
magistrate
and
officers
visited
him
and
demanded
the
articles
he
had
obtained
the
farmer
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
theft
and
all
participation
in
the
booty
aymar
however
by
means
of
his
rod
discovered
the
secreted
property
and
restored
it
to
the
persons
from
whom
it
had
been
stolen
on
another
occasion
aymar
had
been
in
quest
of
a
spring
of
water
when
he
felt
his
rod
turn
sharply
in
his
hand
on
digging
at
the
spot
expecting
to
discover
an
abundant
source
the
body
of
a
murdered
woman
was
found
in
a
barrel
with
a
rope
twisted
round
her
neck
the
poor
creature
was
recognized
as
a
woman
of
the
neighborhood
who
had
vanished
four
months
before
aymar
went
to
the
house
which
the
victim
had
inhabited
and
presented
his
rod
to
each
member
of
the
household
it
turned
upon
the
husband
of
the
deceased
who
at
once
took
to
flight
the
magistrates
of
lyons
at
their
wits
ends
how
to
discover
the
perpetrators
of
the
double
murder
in
the
wine
shop
urged
the
procureur
du
roi
to
make
experiment
of
the
powers
of
jacques
aymar
the
fellow
was
sent
for
and
he
boldly
asserted
his
capacity
for
detecting
criminals
if
he
were
first
brought
to
the
spot
of
the
murder
so
as
to
be
put
with
the
murderers
he
was
at
once
conducted
to
the
scene
of
the
outrage
with
the
rod
in
his
hand
this
remained
stationary
as
he
traversed
the
cellar
till
he
reached
the
spot
where
the
body
of
the
wine
seller
had
lain
then
the
stick
became
violently
agitated
and
the
man
pulse
rose
as
though
he
were
in
an
access
of
fever
the
same
motions
and
symptoms
manifested
themselves
when
he
reached
the
place
where
the
second
victim
had
lain
having
thus
received
his
aymar
left
the
cellar
and
guided
by
his
rod
or
rather
by
an
internal
instinct
he
ascended
into
the
shop
and
then
stepping
into
the
street
he
followed
from
one
to
another
like
a
hound
upon
the
scent
the
track
of
the
murderers
it
conducted
him
into
the
court
of
the
archiepiscopal
palace
across
it
and
down
to
the
gate
of
the
rhone
it
was
now
evening
and
the
city
gates
being
all
closed
the
quest
of
blood
was
relinquished
for
the
night
next
morning
aymar
returned
to
the
scent
accompanied
by
three
officers
he
left
the
gate
and
descended
the
right
bank
of
the
rhone
the
rod
gave
indications
of
there
having
been
three
involved
in
the
murder
and
he
pursued
the
traces
till
two
of
them
led
to
a
cottage
into
this
he
entered
and
there
he
asserted
with
warmth
against
the
asseverations
of
the
proprietor
to
the
contrary
that
the
fugitives
had
entered
his
room
had
seated
themselves
at
his
table
and
had
drunk
wine
out
of
one
of
the
bottles
which
he
indicated
aymar
tested
each
of
the
household
with
his
rod
to
see
if
they
had
been
in
contact
with
the
murderers
the
rod
moved
over
the
two
children
only
aged
respectively
ten
and
nine
years
these
little
things
on
being
questioned
answered
with
reluctance
that
during
their
absence
on
sunday
morning
against
his
express
commands
they
had
left
the
door
open
and
that
two
men
whom
they
described
had
come
in
suddenly
upon
them
and
had
seated
themselves
and
made
free
with
the
wine
in
the
bottle
pointed
out
by
the
man
with
the
rod
this
first
verification
of
the
talents
of
jacques
aymar
convinced
some
of
the
sceptical
but
the
procurateur
général
forbade
the
prosecution
of
the
experiment
till
the
man
had
been
further
tested
as
already
stated
a
hedging
bill
had
been
discovered
on
the
scene
of
the
murder
smeared
with
blood
and
unquestionably
the
weapon
with
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
three
bills
from
the
same
maker
and
of
precisely
the
same
description
were
obtained
and
the
four
were
taken
into
a
garden
and
secretly
buried
at
intervals
aymar
was
then
brought
staff
in
hand
into
the
garden
and
conducted
over
the
spots
where
lay
the
bills
the
rod
began
to
vibrate
as
his
feet
stood
upon
the
place
where
was
concealed
the
bill
which
had
been
used
by
the
assassins
but
was
motionless
elsewhere
still
unsatisfied
the
four
bills
were
exhumed
and
concealed
anew
the
comptroller
of
the
province
himself
bandaged
the
sorcerer
eyes
and
led
him
by
the
hand
from
place
to
place
the
divining
rod
showed
no
signs
of
movement
till
it
approached
the
weapon
when
it
began
to
oscillate
the
magistrates
were
now
so
far
satisfied
as
to
agree
that
jacques
aymar
should
be
authorized
to
follow
the
trail
of
the
murderers
and
have
a
company
of
archers
to
follow
him
guided
by
his
rod
aymar
now
recommenced
his
pursuit
he
continued
tracing
down
the
right
bank
of
the
rhone
till
he
came
to
half
a
league
from
the
bridge
of
lyons
here
the
footprints
of
three
men
were
observed
in
the
sand
as
though
engaged
in
entering
a
boat
a
rowing
boat
was
obtained
and
aymar
with
his
escort
descended
the
river
he
found
some
difficulty
in
following
the
trail
upon
water
still
he
was
able
with
a
little
care
to
detect
it
it
brought
him
under
an
arch
of
the
bridge
of
vienne
which
boats
rarely
passed
beneath
this
proved
that
the
fugitives
were
without
a
guide
the
way
in
which
this
curious
journey
was
made
was
singular
at
intervals
aymar
was
put
ashore
to
test
the
banks
with
his
rod
and
ascertain
whether
the
murderers
had
landed
he
discovered
the
places
where
they
had
slept
and
indicated
the
chairs
or
benches
on
which
they
had
sat
in
this
manner
by
slow
degrees
he
arrived
at
the
military
camp
of
sablon
between
vienne
and
there
aymar
felt
violent
agitation
his
cheeks
flushed
and
his
pulse
beat
with
rapidity
he
penetrated
the
crowds
of
soldiers
but
did
not
venture
to
use
his
rod
lest
the
men
should
take
it
ill
and
fall
upon
him
he
could
not
do
more
without
special
authority
and
was
constrained
to
return
to
lyons
the
magistrates
then
provided
him
with
the
requisite
powers
and
he
went
back
to
the
camp
now
he
declared
that
the
murderers
were
not
there
he
recommenced
his
pursuit
and
descended
the
rhone
again
as
far
as
beaucaire
on
entering
the
town
he
ascertained
by
means
of
his
rod
that
those
whom
he
was
pursuing
had
parted
company
he
traversed
several
streets
then
crowded
on
account
of
the
annual
fair
and
was
brought
to
a
standstill
before
the
prison
doors
one
of
the
murderers
was
within
he
declared
he
would
track
the
others
afterwards
having
obtained
permission
to
enter
he
was
brought
into
the
presence
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
prisoners
amongst
these
was
a
hunchback
who
had
only
an
hour
previously
been
incarcerated
on
account
of
a
theft
he
had
committed
at
the
fair
aymar
applied
his
rod
to
each
of
the
prisoners
in
succession
it
turned
upon
the
hunchback
the
sorcerer
ascertained
that
the
other
two
had
left
the
town
by
a
little
path
leading
into
the
nismes
road
instead
of
following
this
track
he
returned
to
lyons
with
the
hunchback
and
the
guard
at
lyons
a
triumph
awaited
him
the
hunchback
had
hitherto
protested
his
innocence
and
declared
that
he
had
never
set
foot
in
lyons
but
as
he
was
brought
to
that
town
by
the
way
along
which
aymar
had
ascertained
that
he
had
left
it
the
fellow
was
recognized
at
the
different
houses
where
he
had
lodged
the
night
or
stopped
for
food
at
the
little
town
of
bagnols
he
was
confronted
with
the
host
and
hostess
of
a
tavern
where
he
and
his
comrades
had
slept
and
they
swore
to
his
identity
and
accurately
described
his
companions
their
description
tallied
with
that
given
by
the
children
of
the
gardener
the
wretched
man
was
so
confounded
by
this
recognition
that
he
avowed
having
staid
there
a
few
days
before
along
with
two
provençals
these
men
he
said
were
the
criminals
he
had
been
their
servant
and
had
only
kept
guard
in
the
upper
room
whilst
they
committed
the
murders
in
the
cellar
on
his
arrival
in
lyons
he
was
committed
to
prison
and
his
trial
was
decided
on
at
his
first
interrogation
he
told
his
tale
precisely
as
he
had
related
it
before
with
these
additions
the
murderers
spoke
patois
and
had
purchased
two
bills
at
ten
in
the
evening
all
three
had
entered
the
wine
shop
the
provençals
had
a
large
bottle
wrapped
in
straw
and
they
persuaded
the
publican
and
his
wife
to
descend
with
them
into
the
cellar
to
fill
it
whilst
he
the
hunchback
acted
as
watch
in
the
shop
the
two
men
murdered
the
and
his
wife
with
their
bills
and
then
mounted
to
the
shop
where
they
opened
the
coffer
and
stole
from
it
one
hundred
and
thirty
crowns
eight
and
a
silver
belt
the
crime
accomplished
they
took
refuge
in
the
court
of
a
large
house
this
was
the
archbishop
palace
indicated
by
aymar
and
passed
the
night
in
it
next
day
early
they
left
lyons
and
only
stopped
for
a
moment
at
a
gardener
cottage
some
way
down
the
river
they
found
a
boat
moored
to
the
bank
this
they
loosed
from
its
mooring
and
entered
they
came
ashore
at
the
spot
pointed
out
by
the
man
with
the
stick
they
staid
some
days
in
the
camp
at
sablon
and
then
went
on
to
beaucaire
aymar
was
now
sent
in
quest
of
the
other
murderers
he
resumed
their
trail
at
the
gate
of
beaucaire
and
that
of
one
of
them
after
considerable
led
him
to
the
prison
doors
of
beaucaire
and
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
search
among
the
prisoners
for
his
man
this
time
he
was
mistaken
the
second
fugitive
was
not
within
but
the
jailer
affirmed
that
a
man
whom
he
described
and
his
description
tallied
with
the
known
appearance
of
one
of
the
provençals
had
called
at
the
gate
shortly
after
the
removal
of
the
hunchback
to
inquire
after
him
and
on
learning
of
his
removal
to
lyons
had
hurried
off
precipitately
aymar
now
followed
his
track
from
the
prison
and
this
brought
him
to
that
of
the
third
criminal
he
pursued
the
double
scent
for
some
days
but
it
became
evident
that
the
two
culprits
had
been
alarmed
at
what
had
transpired
in
beaucaire
and
were
flying
from
france
aymar
traced
them
to
the
frontier
and
then
returned
to
lyons
on
the
of
august
the
poor
hunchback
was
according
to
sentence
broken
on
the
wheel
in
the
place
des
terreaux
on
his
way
to
execution
he
had
to
pass
the
wine
shop
there
the
recorder
publicly
read
his
sentence
which
had
been
delivered
by
thirty
judges
the
criminal
knelt
and
asked
pardon
of
the
poor
wretches
in
whose
murder
he
was
involved
after
which
he
continued
his
course
to
the
place
fixed
for
his
execution
it
may
be
well
here
to
give
an
account
of
the
authorities
for
this
extraordinary
story
there
are
three
circumstantial
accounts
and
numerous
letters
written
by
the
magistrate
who
sat
during
the
trial
and
by
an
of
the
whole
transaction
men
honorable
and
disinterested
upon
whose
veracity
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
was
supposed
to
rest

their
contemporaries

the
following
circumstance
happened
to
me
yesterday
evening
he
says
le
procureur
du
roi
here
who
by
the
way
is
one
of
the
wisest
and
cleverest
men
in
the
country
sent
for
me
at
six
and
had
me
conducted
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
we
found
there
grimaut
director
of
the
customs
whom
i
knew
to
be
a
very
upright
man
and
a
young
attorney
named
besson
with
whom
i
am
not
acquainted
but
who
le
procureur
du
roi
told
me
had
the
power
of
using
the
rod
as
well
as
grimaut
we
descended
into
the
cellar
where
the
murder
had
been
committed
and
where
there
were
still
traces
of
blood
each
time
that
grimaut
and
the
attorney
passed
the
spot
where
the
murder
had
been
perpetrated
the
rods
they
held
in
their
hands
began
to
turn
but
ceased
when
they
stepped
beyond
the
spot
we
tried
experiments
for
more
than
an
hour
as
also
with
the
bill
which
le
procureur
had
brought
along
with
him
and
they
were
satisfactory
i
observed
several
curious
facts
in
the
attorney
the
rod
in
his
hands
was
more
violently
moved
than
in
those
of
grimaut
and
when
i
placed
one
of
my
fingers
in
each
of
his
hands
whilst
the
rod
turned
i
felt
the
most
extraordinary
throbbings
of
the
arteries
in
his
palms
his
pulse
was
at
fever
heat
he
sweated
profusely
and
at
intervals
he
was
compelled
to
go
into
the
court
to
obtain
fresh
air
the
sieur
pauthot
dean
of
the
college
of
medicine
at
lyons
gave
his
observations
to
the
public
as
well
some
of
them
are
as
follows
we
began
at
the
cellar
in
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
into
this
the
man
with
the
rod
aymar
shrank
from
entering
because
he
felt
violent
agitations
which
overcame
him
when
he
used
the
stick
over
the
place
where
the
corpses
of
those
who
had
been
assassinated
had
lain
on
entering
the
cellar
the
rod
was
put
in
my
hands
and
arranged
by
the
master
as
most
suitable
for
operation
i
passed
and
repassed
over
the
spot
where
the
bodies
had
been
found
but
it
remained
immovable
and
i
felt
no
agitation
a
lady
of
rank
and
merit
who
was
with
us
took
the
rod
after
me
she
felt
it
begin
to
move
and
was
internally
agitated
then
the
owner
of
the
rod
resumed
it
and
passing
over
the
same
places
the
stick
rotated
with
such
violence
that
it
seemed
easier
to
break
than
to
stop
it
the
peasant
then
quitted
our
company
to
faint
away
as
was
his
wont
after
similar
experiments
i
followed
him
he
turned
very
pale
and
broke
into
a
profuse
perspiration
whilst
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
his
pulse
was
violently
troubled
indeed
the
faintness
was
so
considerable
that
they
were
obliged
to
dash
water
in
his
face
and
give
him
water
to
drink
in
order
to
bring
him
round
he
then
describes
experiments
made
over
the
bloody
bill
and
others
similar
which
succeeded
in
the
hands
of
aymar
and
the
lady
but
failed
when
he
attempted
them
himself
pierre
garnier
physician
of
the
medical
college
of
montpellier
appointed
to
that
of
lyons
has
also
written
an
account
of
what
he
saw
as
mentioned
above
he
gives
a
curious
proof
of
aymar
powers
le
having
been
robbed
by
one
of
his
lackeys
seven
or
eight
months
ago
and
having
lost
by
him
crowns
which
had
been
taken
out
of
one
of
the
cabinets
behind
his
library
sent
for
aymar
and
asked
him
to
discover
the
circumstances
aymar
went
several
times
round
the
chamber
rod
in
hand
placing
one
foot
on
the
chairs
on
the
various
articles
of
furniture
and
on
two
bureaux
which
are
in
the
apartment
each
of
which
contains
several
drawers
he
fixed
on
the
very
bureau
and
the
identical
drawer
out
of
which
the
money
had
been
stolen
le
bade
him
follow
the
track
of
the
robber
he
did
so
with
his
rod
he
went
out
on
a
new
terrace
upon
which
the
cabinet
opens
thence
back
into
the
cabinet
and
up
to
the
fire
then
into
the
library
and
from
thence
he
went
direct
up
stairs
to
the
lackeys
sleeping
apartment
when
the
rod
guided
him
to
one
of
the
beds
and
turned
over
one
side
of
the
bed
remaining
motionless
over
the
other
the
lackeys
then
present
cried
out
that
the
thief
had
slept
on
the
side
indicated
by
the
rod
the
bed
having
been
shared
with
another
footman
who
occupied
the
further
side
garnier
gives
a
lengthy
account
of
various
experiments
he
made
along
with
the
the
uncle
of
the
same
the
abbé
de
st
remain
and
de
puget
to
detect
whether
there
was
imposture
in
the
man
but
all
their
attempts
failed
to
discover
a
trace
of
deception
he
gives
a
report
of
a
verbal
examination
of
aymar
which
is
interesting
the
man
always
replied
with
candor
the
report
of
the
extraordinary
discovery
of
murder
made
by
the
divining
rod
at
lyons
attracted
the
attention
of
paris
and
aymar
was
ordered
up
to
the
capital
there
however
his
powers
left
him
the
prince
de
condé
submitted
him
to
various
tests
and
he
broke
down
under
every
one
five
holes
were
dug
in
the
garden
in
one
was
secreted
gold
in
another
silver
in
a
third
silver
and
gold
in
the
fourth
copper
and
in
the
fifth
stones
the
rod
made
no
signs
in
presence
of
the
metals
and
at
last
actually
began
to
move
over
the
buried
pebbles
he
was
sent
to
chantilly
to
discover
the
perpetrators
of
a
theft
of
trout
made
in
the
ponds
of
the
park
he
went
round
the
water
rod
in
hand
and
it
turned
at
spots
where
he
said
the
fish
had
been
drawn
out
then
following
the
track
of
the
thief
it
led
him
to
the
cottage
of
one
of
the
keepers
but
did
not
move
over
any
of
the
individuals
then
in
the
house
the
keeper
himself
was
absent
but
arrived
late
at
night
and
on
hearing
what
was
said
he
roused
aymar
from
his
bed
insisting
on
having
his
innocence
vindicated
the
divining
rod
however
pronounced
him
guilty
and
the
poor
fellow
took
to
his
heels
much
upon
the
principle
recommended
by
montesquieu
a
while
after
said
he
if
you
are
accused
of
having
stolen
the
towers
of
bolt
at
once
a
peasant
taken
at
haphazard
from
the
street
was
brought
to
the
sorcerer
as
one
suspected
the
rod
turned
slightly
and
aymar
declared
that
the
man
did
not
steal
the
fish
but
ate
of
them
a
boy
was
then
introduced
who
was
said
to
be
the
keeper
son
the
rod
rotated
violently
at
once
this
was
the
finishing
stroke
and
aymar
was
sent
away
by
the
prince
in
disgrace
it
now
transpired
that
the
theft
of
fish
had
taken
place
seven
years
before
and
the
lad
was
no
relation
of
the
keeper
but
a
country
boy
who
had
only
been
in
chantilly
eight
or
ten
months
goyonnot
recorder
of
the
king
council
broke
a
window
in
his
house
and
sent
for
the
diviner
to
whom
he
related
a
story
of
his
having
been
robbed
of
valuables
during
the
night
aymar
indicated
the
broken
window
as
the
means
whereby
the
thief
had
entered
the
house
and
pointed
out
the
window
by
which
he
had
left
it
with
the
booty
as
no
such
robbery
had
been
committed
aymar
was
turned
out
of
the
house
as
an
impostor
a
few
similar
cases
brought
him
into
such
disrepute
that
he
was
obliged
to
leave
paris
and
return
to
grenoble
some
years
after
he
was
made
use
of
by
the
maréchal
montrevel
in
his
cruel
pursuit
of
the
camisards
was
aymar
an
impostor
from
first
to
last
or
did
his
powers
fail
him
in
paris
and
was
it
only
then
that
he
had
recourse
to
fraud
much
may
be
said
in
favor
of
either
supposition
his
at
paris
tells
heavily
against
him
but
need
not
be
regarded
as
conclusive
evidence
of
imposture
throughout
his
career
if
he
really
did
possess
the
powers
he
claimed
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
these
existed
in
full
vigor
under
all
conditions
and
paris
is
a
place
most
unsuitable
for
testing
them
built
on
artificial
soil
and
full
of
disturbing
influences
of
every
description
it
has
been
remarked
with
others
who
used
the
rod
that
their
powers
languished
under
excitement
and
that
the
faculties
had
to
be
in
repose
the
attention
to
be
concentrated
on
the
subject
of
inquiry
or
the
action
nervous
magnetic
or
electrical
or
what
you
will
was
impeded
now
paris
visited
for
the
first
time
by
a
poor
peasant
its
open
to
him
dazzling
him
with
their
splendor
and
the
novelty
of
finding
himself
in
the
midst
of
princes
dukes
marquises
and
their
families
not
only
may
have
agitated
the
countryman
to
such
an
extent
as
to
deprive
him
of
his
peculiar
faculty
but
may
have
led
him
into
simulating
what
he
felt
had
departed
from
him
at
the
moment
when
he
was
under
the
eyes
of
the
grandees
of
the
court
we
have
analogous
cases
in
bleton
and
angelique
cottin
the
former
was
a
hydroscope
who
fell
into
convulsions
whenever
he
passed
over
running
water
this
peculiarity
was
noticed
in
him
when
a
child
of
seven
years
old
when
brought
to
paris
he
failed
signally
to
detect
the
presence
of
water
conveyed
underground
by
pipes
and
conduits
but
he
pretended
to
feel
the
influence
of
water
where
there
certainly
was
none
angelique
cottin
was
a
poor
girl
highly
charged
with
electricity
any
one
touching
her
received
a
violent
shock
one
medical
gentleman
having
seated
her
on
his
knee
was
knocked
clean
out
of
his
chair
by
the
electric
fluid
which
thus
exhibited
its
sense
of
propriety
but
the
electric
condition
of
angelique
became
feebler
as
she
approached
paris
and
failed
her
altogether
in
the
capital
i
believe
that
the
imagination
is
the
principal
motive
force
in
those
who
use
the
divining
rod
but
whether
it
is
so
solely
i
am
unable
to
decide
the
powers
of
nature
are
so
mysterious
and
inscrutable
that
we
must
be
cautious
in
limiting
them
under
abnormal
conditions
to
the
ordinary
laws
of
experience
illustration
how
to
hold
a
divining
rod
the
manner
in
which
the
rod
was
used
by
certain
persons
renders
possible
the
rod
is
generally
of
hazel
and
is
forked
like
a
y
the
forefingers
are
placed
against
the
diverging
arms
of
the
rod
and
the
elbows
are
brought
back
against
the
side
thus
the
implement
is
held
in
front
of
the
operator
delicately
balanced
before
the
pit
of
the
stomach
at
a
distance
of
about
eight
inches
now
if
the
pressure
of
the
balls
of
the
digits
be
in
the
least
relaxed
the
stalk
of
the
rod
will
naturally
fall
it
has
been
assumed
by
some
that
a
restoration
of
the
pressure
will
bring
the
stem
up
again
pointing
towards
the
operator
and
a
little
further
pressure
will
elevate
it
into
a
perpendicular
position
a
relaxation
of
force
will
again
lower
it
and
thus
the
rotation
observed
in
the
rod
be
maintained
i
confess
myself
unable
to
accomplish
this
the
lowering
of
the
leg
of
the
rod
is
easy
enough
but
no
efforts
of
mine
to
produce
a
revolution
on
its
axis
have
as
yet
succeeded
the
muscles
which
would
contract
the
fingers
upon
the
arms
of
the
stick
pass
the
shoulder
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
one
of
the
medical
men
who
witnessed
the
experiments
made
on
bleton
the
hydroscope
expressly
alludes
to
a
slight
rising
of
the
shoulders
during
the
rotation
of
the
divining
rod
but
the
manner
of
using
the
rod
was
by
no
means
identical
in
all
cases
if
in
all
cases
it
had
simply
been
balanced
between
the
fingers
some
probability
might
be
given
to
the
suggestion
above
made
that
the
rotation
was
always
effected
by
the
involuntary
action
of
the
muscles
the
usual
manner
of
holding
the
rod
however
precluded
such
a
possibility
the
most
ordinary
use
consisted
in
taking
a
forked
stick
in
such
a
manner
that
the
palms
were
turned
upwards
and
the
fingers
closed
upon
the
branching
arms
of
the
rod
some
required
the
normal
position
of
the
rod
to
be
horizontal
others
elevated
the
point
others
again
depressed
it
if
the
implement
were
straight
it
was
held
in
a
similar
manner
but
the
hands
were
brought
somewhat
together
so
as
to
produce
a
slight
arc
in
the
rod
some
who
practised
rhabdomancy
sustained
this
species
of
rod
between
their
thumbs
and
forefingers
or
else
the
thumb
and
forefingers
were
closed
and
the
rod
rested
on
their
points
or
again
it
reposed
on
the
flat
of
the
hand
or
on
the
back
the
hand
being
held
vertically
and
the
rod
held
in
equilibrium
a
third
species
of
divining
rod
consisted
in
a
straight
staff
cut
in
two
one
extremity
of
the
one
half
was
hollowed
out
the
other
half
was
sharpened
at
the
end
and
this
end
was
inserted
in
the
hollow
and
the
pointed
stick
rotated

the
way
in
which
bleton
used
his
rod
is
thus
minutely
described
he
does
not
grasp
it
nor
warm
it
in
his
hands
and
he
does
not
regard
with
preference
a
hazel
branch
lately
cut
and
full
of
sap
he
places
horizontally
between
his
forefingers
a
rod
of
any
kind
given
to
him
or
picked
up
in
the
road
of
any
sort
of
wood
except
elder
fresh
or
dry
not
always
forked
but
sometimes
merely
bent
if
it
is
straight
it
rises
slightly
at
the
extremities
by
little
jerks
but
does
not
turn
if
bent
it
revolves
on
its
axis
with
more
or
less
rapidity
in
more
or
less
time
according
to
the
quantity
and
current
of
the
water
i
counted
from
thirty
to
revolutions
in
a
minute
and
afterwards
as
many
as
eighty
a
curious
phenomenon
is
that
bleton
is
able
to
make
the
rod
turn
between
another
fingers
even
without
seeing
it
or
touching
it
by
approaching
his
body
towards
it
when
his
feet
stand
over
a
subterranean
watercourse
it
is
true
however
that
the
motion
is
much
less
strong
and
less
durable
in
other
fingers
than
his
own
if
bleton
stood
on
his
head
and
placed
the
rod
between
his
feet
though
he
felt
strongly
the
peculiar
sensations
produced
in
him
by
flowing
water
yet
the
rod
remained
stationary
if
he
were
insulated
on
glass
silk
or
wax
the
sensations
were
less
vivid
and
the
rotation
of
the
stick
ceased
but
this
experiment
failed
in
paris
under
circumstances
which
either
proved
that
bleton
imagination
produced
the
movement
or
that
his
integrity
was
questionable
it
is
quite
possible
that
in
many
instances
the
action
of
the
muscles
is
purely
involuntary
and
is
attributable
to
the
imagination
so
that
the
operator
deceives
himself
as
well
as
others
this
is
probably
the
explanation
of
the
story
of
mdlle
olivet
a
young
lady
of
tender
conscience
who
was
a
skilful
performer
with
the
divining
rod
but
shrank
from
putting
her
powers
in
operation
lest
she
should
be
indulging
in
unlawful
acts
she
consulted
the
père
lebrun
author
of
a
work
already
referred
to
in
this
paper
and
he
advised
her
to
ask
god
to
withdraw
the
power
from
her
if
the
exercise
of
it
was
harmful
to
her
spiritual
condition
she
entered
into
retreat
for
two
days
and
prayed
with
fervor
then
she
made
her
communion
asking
god
what
had
been
recommended
to
her
at
the
moment
when
she
received
the
host
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
she
made
experiment
with
her
rod
and
found
that
it
would
no
longer
operate
the
girl
had
strong
faith
in
it
before
a
faith
coupled
with
fear
and
as
long
as
that
faith
was
strong
in
her
the
rod
moved
now
she
believed
that
the
faculty
was
taken
from
her
and
the
power
ceased
with
the
loss
of
her
faith
if
the
divining
rod
is
put
in
motion
by
any
other
force
except
the
involuntary
action
of
the
muscles
we
must
confine
its
powers
to
the
property
of
indicating
the
presence
of
flowing
water
there
are
numerous
instances
of
hydroscopes
thus
detecting
the
existence
of
a
spring
or
of
a
subterranean
watercourse
the
most
remarkably
endowed
individuals

this
description

experienced
a
horror
when
near
water
which
no
one

perceived

faculty

i
have
heard

by

i
have
never
been
able
to
ascertain
that
such
is
really
the
case
the
mining
captains
whom
i
have
questioned
invariably
repudiated
all
knowledge
of
its
use
in

however
it
is
still
employed
for
the
purpose
of
detecting
water
and
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
i
have
just
received
will
show
that
it
is
still
in
vogue
on
the
continent
i
believe
the
use
of
the
divining
rod
for
discovering
springs
of
water
has
by
no
means
been
confined
to
mediæval
times
for
i
was
personally
acquainted
with
a
lady
now
deceased
who
has
successfully
practised
with
it

this
way
she
was

very
clever
and
accomplished
woman

open
and
straightforward
disposition
captain
c
her
husband
had
a
large
estate
in

supporting
a
considerable
population
and
whether
for

wants
of
the
people
or
for
the
improvement
of
the
land
it
now
and
then
happened
that
an
additional
well
was
needed
on
one
of
these
occasions
a
man
was
sent
for
who
made
a
regular
profession
of
finding
water
by
the
divining
rod
there
happened
to
be
a
large
party
staying
at
the
house
and
the
whole
company
turned
out
to
see
the
fun
the
rod
gave
indications
in
the
usual
way
and
water
was
ultimately
found
at
the
spot
c
utterly
sceptical
took
the
rod
into
her
own
hands
to
make
experiment
believing
that
she
would
prove
the
man
an
impostor
and
she
said
afterwards
she
was
never
more
frightened
in
her
life
than
when
it
began
to
move
on
her
walking
over
the
spring
several
other
gentlemen
and
ladies
tried
it
but
it
was
quite
inactive
in
their
hands
said
the
host
to
his
wife
shall
have
no
occasion
to
send
for
the
man
again
as
you
are
such
an
adept
some
months
after
this
water
was
wanted
in
another
part
of
the
estate
and
it
occurred
to
c
that
she
would
use
the
rod
again
after
some
trials
it
again
gave
decided
indications
and
a
well
was
begun
and
carried
down
a
very
considerable
depth
at
last
she
began
to
shrink
from
incurring
more
expense
but
the
laborers
had
implicit
faith
and
begged
to
be
allowed
to
persevere
very
soon
the
water
burst
up
with
such
force
that
the
men
escaped
with
difficulty
and
this
proved
afterwards
the
most
unfailing
spring
for
miles
round
you
will
take
the
above
for
what
it
is
worth
the
facts
i
have
given
are
undoubtedly
true
whatever
conclusions
may
be
drawn
from
them
i
do
not
propose
that
you
should
print
my
narrative
but
i
think
in
these
cases
personal
testimony
even
indirect
is
more
useful
in
forming
one
opinion
than
a
hundred
old
volumes
i
did
not
hear
it
from
c
own
lips
but
i
was
sufficiently
acquainted
with
her
to
form
a
very
tolerable
estimate
of
her
character
and
my
wife
who
has
known
her
intimately
from
her
own
childhood
was
in
her
younger
days
often
staying
with
her
for
months
together
i
remember
having
been
much
perplexed
by
reading
a
series
of
experiments
made
with
a
pendulous
ring
over
metals
by
a
mayo
he
ascertained
that
it
oscillated
in
various
directions
under
peculiar
circumstances
when
suspended
by
a
thread
over
the
ball
of
the
thumb
i
instituted
a
series
of
experiments
and
was
surprised
to
find
the
ring
vibrate
in
an
unaccountable
manner
in
opposite
directions
over
different
metals
on
consideration
i
closed
my
eyes
whilst
the
ring
was
oscillating
over
gold
and
on
opening
them
i
found
that
it
had
become
stationary
i
got
a
friend
to
change
the
metals
whilst
i
was
blindfolded
the
ring
no
longer
vibrated
i
was
thus
enabled
to
judge
of
the
involuntary
action
of
muscles
quite
sufficient
to
have
deceived
an
eminent
medical
man
like
mayo
and
to
have
perplexed
me
till
i
succeeded
in
solving
the
mystery

a

of
experiments

as
i

by

in

with
similar
results
the
seven
sleepers
of
ephesus
one
of
the
most
picturesque
myths
of
ancient
days
is
that
which
forms
the
subject
of
this
article
it
is
thus
told
by
jacques
de
voragine
in
his
legenda
aurea
the
seven
sleepers
were
natives
of
ephesus
the
emperor
decius
who
persecuted
the
christians
having
come
to
ephesus
ordered
the
erection
of
temples
in
the
city
that
all
might
come
and
sacrifice
before
him
and
he
commanded
that
the
christians
should
be
sought
out
and
given
their
choice
either
to
worship
the
idols
or
to
die
so
great
was
the
consternation
in
the
city
that
the
friend
denounced
his
friend
the
father
his
son
and
the
son
his
father
now
there
were
in
ephesus
seven
christians
maximian
malchus
marcian
dionysius
john
serapion
and
constantine
by
name
these
refused
to
sacrifice
to
the
idols
and
remained
in
their
houses
praying
and
fasting
they
were
accused
before
decius
and
they
confessed
themselves
to
be
christians
however
the
emperor
gave
them
a
little
time
to
consider
what
line
they
would
adopt
they
took
advantage
of
this
reprieve
to
dispense
their
goods
among
the
poor
and
then
they
retired
all
seven
to
mount
celion
where
they
determined
to
conceal
themselves
one
of
their
number
malchus
in
the
disguise
of
a
physician
went
to
the
town
to
obtain
victuals
decius
who
had
been
absent
from
ephesus
for
a
little
while
returned
and
gave
orders
for
the
seven
to
be
sought
malchus
having
escaped
from
the
town
fled
full
of
fear
to
his
comrades
and
told
them
of
the
emperor
fury
they
were
much
alarmed
and
malchus
handed
them
the
loaves
he
had
bought
bidding
them
eat
that
fortified
by
the
food
they
might
have
courage
in
the
time
of
trial
they
ate
and
then
as
they
sat
weeping
and
speaking
to
one
another
by
the
will
of
god
they
fell
asleep
the
pagans
sought
everywhere
but
could
not
find
them
and
decius
was
greatly
irritated
at
their
escape
he
had
their
parents
brought
before
him
and
threatened
them
with
death
if
they
did
not
reveal
the
place
of
concealment
but
they
could
only
answer
that
the
seven
young
men
had
distributed
their
goods
to
the
poor
and
that
they
were
quite
ignorant
as
to
their
whereabouts
decius
thinking
it
possible
that
they
might
be
hiding
in
a
cavern
blocked
up
the
mouth
with
stones
that
they
might
perish
of
hunger
three
hundred
and
sixty
years
passed
and
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
the
reign
of
theodosius
there
broke
forth
a
heresy
denying
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
now
it
happened
that
an
ephesian
was
building
a
stable
on
the
side
of
mount
celion
and
finding
a
pile
of
stones
handy
he
took
them
for
his
edifice
and
thus
opened
the
mouth
of
the
cave
then
the
seven
sleepers
awoke
and
it
was
to
them
as
if
they
had
slept
but
a
single
night
they
began
to
ask
malchus
what
decision
decius
had
given
concerning
them
is
going
to
hunt
us
down
so
as
to
force
us
to
sacrifice
to
the
idols
was
his
reply
knows
replied
maximian
shall
never
do
that
then
exhorting
his
companions
he
urged
malchus
to
go
back
to
the
town
to
buy
some
more
bread
and
at
the
same
time
to
obtain
fresh
information
malchus
took
five
coins
and
left
the
cavern
on
seeing
the
stones
he
was
filled
with
astonishment
however
he
went
on
towards
the
city
but
what
was
his
bewilderment
on
approaching
the
gate
to
see
over
it
a
cross
he
went
to
another
gate
and
there
he
beheld
the
same
sacred
sign
and
so
he
observed
it
over
each
gate
of
the
city
he
believed
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
effects
of
a
dream
then
he
entered
ephesus
rubbing
his
eyes
and
he
walked
to
a
baker
shop
he
heard
people
using
our
lord
name
and
he
was
the
more
perplexed
no
one
dared
pronounce
the
name
of
jesus
and
now
it
is
on
every
one
lips
wonderful
i
can
hardly
believe
myself
to
be
in
ephesus
he
asked
a
the
name
of
the
city
and
on
being
told
it
was
ephesus
he
was
thunderstruck
now
he
entered
a
baker
shop
and
laid
down
his
money
the
baker
examining
the
coin
inquired
whether
he
had
found
a
treasure
and
began
to
whisper
to
some
others
in
the
shop
the
youth
thinking
that
he
was
discovered
and
that
they
were
about
to
conduct
him
to
the
emperor
implored
them
to
let
him
alone
offering
to
leave
loaves
and
money
if
he
might
only
be
suffered
to
escape
but
the
seizing
him
said
you
are
you
have
found
a
treasure
show
us
where
it
is
that
we
may
share
it
with
you
and
then
we
will
hide
you
malchus
was
too
frightened
to
answer
so
they
put
a
rope
round
his
neck
and
drew
him
through
the
streets
into
the
the
news
soon
spread
that
the
young
man
had
discovered
a
great
treasure
and
there
was
presently
a
vast
crowd
about
him
he
stoutly
protested
his
innocence
no
one
recognized
him
and
his
eyes
ranging
over
the
faces
which
surrounded
him
could
not
see
one
which
he
had
known
or
which
was
in
the
slightest
degree
familiar
to
him
martin
the
bishop
and
antipater
the
governor
having
heard
of
the
excitement
ordered
the
young
man
to
be
brought
before
them
along
with
the
bakers
the
bishop
and
the
governor
asked
him
where
he
had
found
the
treasure
and
he
replied
that
he
had
found
none
but
that
the
few
coins
were
from
his
own
purse
he
was
next
asked
whence
he
came
he
replied
that
he
was
a
native
of
ephesus
this
be
ephesus
for
your
relations
your
parents
if
they
live
here
ordered
the
governor
live
here
certainly
replied
the
youth
and
he
mentioned
their
names
no
such
names
were
known
in
the
town
then
the
governor
exclaimed
dare
you
say
that
this
money
belonged
to
your
parents
when
it
dates
back
three
hundred
and
years
and
is
as
old
as
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
decius
and
it
is
utterly
unlike
our
modern
coinage
do
you
think
to
impose
on
the
old
men
and
sages
of
ephesus
believe
me
i
shall
make
you
suffer
the
severities
of
the
law
till
you
show
where
you
made
the
discovery
implore
you
cried
malchus
the
name
of
god
answer
me
a
few
questions
and
then
i
will
answer
yours
where
is
the
emperor
decius
gone
to
the
bishop
answered
son
there
is
no
emperor
of
that
name
he
who
was
thus
called
died
long
ago
malchus
replied
i
hear
perplexes
me
more
and
more
follow
me
and
i
will
show
you
my
comrades
who
fled
with
me
into
a
cave
of
mount
celion
only
yesterday
to
escape
the
cruelty
of
decius
i
will
lead
you
to
them
the
bishop
turned
to
the
governor
hand
of
god
is
here
he
said
then
they
followed
and
a
great
crowd
after
them
and
malchus
entered
first
into
the
cavern
to
his
companions
and
the
bishop
after
him
and
there
they
saw
the
martyrs
seated
in
the
cave
with
their
faces
fresh
and
blooming
as
roses
so
all
fell
down
and
glorified
god
the
bishop
and
the
governor
sent
notice
to
theodosius
and
he
hurried
to
ephesus
all
the
inhabitants
met
him
and
conducted
him
to
the
cavern
as
soon
as
the
saints
beheld
the
emperor
their
faces
shone
like
the
sun
and
the
emperor
gave
thanks
unto
god
and
embraced
them
and
said
see
you
as
though
i
saw
the
savior
restoring
lazarus
maximian
replied
us
for
the
faith
sake
god
has
resuscitated
us
before
the
great
resurrection
day
in
order
that
you
may
believe
firmly
in
the
resurrection
of
the
dead
for
as
the
child
is
in
its
mother
womb
living
and
not
suffering
so
have
we
lived
without
suffering
fast
asleep
and
having
thus
spoken
they
bowed
their
heads
and
their
souls
returned
to
their
maker
the
emperor
rising
bent
over
them
and
embraced
them
weeping
he
gave
them
orders
for
golden
reliquaries
to
be
made
but
that
night
they
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
and
said
that
hitherto
they
had
slept
in
the
earth
and
that
in
the
earth
they
desired
to
sleep
on
till
god
should
raise
them
again
such
is
the
beautiful
story
it
seems
to
have
travelled
to
us
from
the
east
jacobus
sarugiensis
a
mesopotamian
bishop
in
the
fifth
or
sixth
century
is
said
to
have
been
the
first
to
commit
it
to
writing
gregory
of
tours
de
glor
mart
i
was
perhaps
the
first
to
introduce
it
to
europe
dionysius
of
antioch
ninth
century
told
the
story
in
syrian
and
photius
of
constantinople
reproduced
it
with
the
remark
that
mahomet
had
adopted
it
into
the
koran
metaphrastus
alludes
to
it
as
well
in
the
tenth
century
eutychius
inserted
it
in
his
annals
of
arabia
it
is
found
in
the
coptic
and
the
maronite
books
and
several
early
historians
as
paulus
diaconus
nicephorus
have
inserted
it
in
their
works
a
poem
on
the
seven
sleepers
was
composed
by
a
trouvère
named
chardri
and
is
mentioned
by
fr
michel
in
his
rapports
ministre
de
public
a
german
poem
on
the
same
subject
of
the
thirteenth
century
in
verses
has
been
published
by
karajan
and
the
spanish
poet
augustin
morreto
composed
a
drama
on
it
entitled
los
siete
durmientes
which
is
inserted
in
the
volume
of
the
rare
work
comedias
nuevas
escogidas
de
los
mejores
ingenios
mahomet
has
somewhat
improved
on
the
story
he
has
made
the
sleepers
prophesy
his
coming
and
he
has
given
them
a
dog
named
kratim
or
kratimir
which
sleeps
with
them
and
which
is
endowed
with
the
gift
of
prophecy
as
a
special
favor
this
dog
is
to
be
one
of
the
ten
animals
to
be
admitted
into
his

the
others

it
was
perhaps
too
much
for
the
seven
sleepers
to
ask
that
their
bodies
should
be
left
to
rest
in
earth
in
ages
when
saintly
relics
were
valued
above
gold
and
precious
stones
their
request
was
sure
to
be
shelved
and
so
we
find
that
their
remains
were
conveyed
to
marseilles
in
a
large
stone
sarcophagus
which
is
still
exhibited
in
victor
church
in
the
musæum
victorium
at
rome
is
a
curious
and
ancient
representation
of
them
in
a
cement
of
sulphur
and
plaster
their
names
are
engraved
beside
them
together
with
certain
attributes
near
constantine
and
john

two
clubs
near

knotty
club

near

as

spoken
of
by
horace
lib
od
and
paulinus
nat
or
carm
as
having
been
used
for
torture
in
this
group
of
figures
the
seven
are
represented
as
young
without
beards
and
indeed
in
ancient
martyrologies
they
are
frequently
called
boys
it
has
been
inferred
from
this
curious
plaster
representation
that
the
seven
may
have
suffered
under
decius
and
have
been
buried
in
the
cave
whilst
the
discovery
and
translation
of
their
relics
under
theodosius
in
may
have
given
rise
to
the
fable
and
this
i
think
probable
enough
the
story
of
long
sleepers
and
the
number
seven
connected
with
it
is
ancient
enough
and
dates
from
heathen
mythology
like
many
another
ancient
myth
it
was
laid
hold
of
by
christian
hands
and
baptized
pliny
relates
the
story
of
epimenides
the
epic
poet
who
when
tending
his
sheep
one
hot
day
wearied
and
oppressed
with
slumber
retreated
into
a
cave
where
he
fell
asleep
after
years
he
awoke
and
found
every
thing
changed
his
brother
whom
he
had
left
a
stripling
was
now
a
hoary
man
epimenides
was
reckoned
one
of
the
seven
sages
by
those
who
exclude
periander
he
flourished
in
the
time
of
solon
after
his
death
at
the
age
of
two
hundred
and
he
was
revered
as
a
god
and
honored
especially
by
the
athenians

the
connection

may
have
had
something
to
do
with
turning
the
seven
martyrs
of
that
city
into
seven
sleepers
the
annals
of
iceland
relate
that
in
a
finn
of
the
name
of
fethmingr
living
in
halogaland
in
the
north
of

happening

three
whole
years

untouched

bird
or
beast
there
certainly
are
authentic
accounts
of
persons
having
slept
for
an
extraordinary
length
of
time
but
i
shall
not
mention
any
as
i
believe
the
legend
we
are
considering
not
to
have
been
an
exaggeration
of
facts
but
a
christianized
myth
of
paganism
the
fact
of
the
number
seven
being
so
prominent
in
many
of
the
tales
seems
to
lead
to
this
conclusion
barbarossa
changes
his

every
seven

charlemagne

precisely
the
same

i
believe
that
the
mythological
core
of
this
picturesque
legend
is
the
repose
of
the
earth
through
the
seven
winter
months
in
the
north
frederic
and
charlemagne
certainly
replace
odin
the
german
and
scandinavian
still
heathen
legends
represent
the
heroes
as
about
to
issue
forth
for
the
defence
of
fatherland
in
the
hour
of
direst
need
the
converted
and
christianized
tale
brings
the
martyr
youths
forth
in
the
hour
when
a
heresy
is
afflicting
the
church
that
they
may
destroy
the
heresy
by
their
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
resurrection
if
there
is
something
majestic
in
the
heathen
myth
there
are
singular
grace
and
beauty
in
the
christian
tale
teaching
as
it
does
such
a
glorious
doctrine
but
it
is
surpassed
in
delicacy
by
the
modern
form
which
the
same
myth
has
assumed
a
form
which
is
a
real
transformation
leaving
the
doctrine
taught
the
same
it
has
been
made
into
a
romance
by
hoffman
and
is
versified
by
trinius
i
may
perhaps
be
allowed
to
translate
with
some
freedom
the
poem
of
the
latter
in
an
ancient
shaft
of
falun
year
by
year
a
body
lay
as
though
a
treasure
kept
unto
the
waking
day
not
the
turmoil
nor
the
passions
of
the
busy
world
sounds
of
war
or
peace
rejoicings
could
disturb
the
placid
dead
once
a
youthful
miner
whistling
hewed
the
chamber
now
his
tomb
crash
the
rocky
fragments
tumbled
closed
him
in
abysmal
gloom
sixty
years
passed
by
ere
miners
toiling
hundred
fathoms
deep
broke
upon
the
shaft
where
rested
that
poor
miner
in
his
sleep
as
the
lie
untarnished
in
the
dingy
soil
and
sand
till
they
gleam
and
flicker
stainless
in
the
digger
sifting
hand
as
the
gem
in
virgin
brilliance
rests
till
ushered
into
day
so
uninjured
uncorrupted
fresh
and
fair
the
body
lay
and
the
miners
bore
it
upward

it
in
the
yellow
sun

from
out
the
neighboring
houses

the
curious

question
who

ask
aloud

half

william

as
an
historical
character
and
visit
the
scenes
made
memorable
by
his
exploits
with
corresponding
interest
when
they
undertake
the
regular
swiss
round
it
is
one
of
the
painful
duties
of
the
antiquarian
to
dispel
many
a
popular
belief
and
to
probe
the
groundlessness
of
many
an
historical
statement
the
antiquarian
is
sometimes
disposed
to
ask
with
pilate
what
is
truth
when
he
finds
historical
facts
crumbling
beneath
his
touch
into
mythological
fables
and
he
soon
learns
to
doubt
and
question
the
most
emphatic
declarations
of
and
claims
to
reliability
sir
walter
raleigh
in
his
prison
was
composing
the
second
volume
of
his
history
of
the
world
leaning
on
the
sill
of
his
window
he
meditated
on
the
duties
of
the
historian
to
mankind
when
suddenly
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
disturbance
in
the
before
his
cell
he
saw
one
man
strike
another
whom
he
supposed
by
his
dress
to
be
an
officer
the
latter
at
once
drew
his
sword
and
ran
the
former
through
the
body
the
wounded
man
felled
his
adversary
with
a
stick
and
then
sank
upon
the
pavement
at
this
juncture
the
guard
came
up
and
carried
off
the
officer
insensible
and
then
the
corpse
of
the
man
who
had
been
run
through
next
day
raleigh
was
visited
by
an
intimate
friend
to
whom
he
related
the
circumstances
of
the
quarrel
and
its
issue
to
his
astonishment
his
friend
unhesitatingly
declared
that
the
prisoner
had
mistaken
the
whole
series
of
incidents
which
had
passed
before
his
eyes
the
supposed
officer
was
not
an
officer
at
all
but
the
servant
of
a
foreign
ambassador
it
was
he
who
had
dealt
the
first
blow
he
had
not
drawn
his
sword
but
the
other
had
snatched
it
from
his
side
and
had
run
through
the
body
before
any
one
could
interfere
whereupon
a
stranger
from
among
the
crowd
knocked
the
murderer
down
with
his
stick
and
some
of
the
foreigners
belonging
to
the
retinue
carried
off
the
corpse
the
friend
of
raleigh
added
that
government
had
ordered
the
arrest
and
immediate
trial
of
the
murderer
as
the
man
assassinated
was
one
of
the
principal
servants
of
the
spanish
ambassador
excuse
me
said
raleigh
but
i
can
not
have
been
deceived
as
you
suppose
for
i
was
to
the
events
which
took
place
under
my
own
window
and
the
man
fell
there
on
that
spot
where
you
see
a
standing
up
above
the
rest
my
dear
raleigh
replied
his
friend
i
was
sitting
on
that
stone
when
the
fray
took
place
and
i
received
this
slight
scratch
on
my
cheek
in
snatching
the
sword
from
the
murderer
and
upon
my
word
of
honor
you
have
been
deceived
upon
every
particular
sir
walter
when
alone
took
up
the
second
volume
of
his
history
which
was
in
and
contemplating
it
thought
if
i
can
not
believe
my
own
eyes
how
can
i
be
assured
of
the
truth
of
a
tithe
of
the
events
which
happened
ages
before
i
was
born
and
he
flung
the
manuscript
into
the
fire
now
i
think
that
i
can
show
that
the
story
of
william
tell
is
as
fabulous
as
what
shall
i
say
any
other
historical
event
it
is
almost
too
well
known
to
need
repetition
in
the
year
gessler
vogt
of
the
emperor
albert
of
hapsburg
set
a
hat
on
a
pole
as
symbol
of
imperial
power
and
ordered
every
one
who
passed
by
to
do
obeisance
towards
it
a
mountaineer
of
the
name
of
tell
boldly
traversed
the
space
before
it
without
saluting
the
abhorred
symbol
by
gessler
command
he
was
at
once
seized
and
brought
before
him
as
tell
was
known
to
be
an
expert
archer
he
was
ordered
by
way
of
punishment
to
shoot
an
apple
off
the
head
of
his
own
son
finding
remonstrance
vain
he
submitted
the
apple
was
placed
on
the
child
head
tell
bent
his
bow
the
arrow
sped
and
apple
and
arrow
fell
together
to
the
ground
but
the
vogt
noticed
that
tell
before
shooting
had
stuck
another
arrow
into
his
belt
and
he
inquired
the
reason
it
was
for
you
replied
the
sturdy
archer
had
i
shot
my
child
know
that
it
would
not
have
missed
your
heart
this
event
observe
took
place
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
but
saxo
grammaticus
a
danish
writer
of
the
twelfth
century
tells
the
story
of
a
hero
of
his
own
country
who
lived
in
the
tenth
century
he
relates
the
incident
in
horrible
style
as
follows
nor
ought
what
follows
to
be
enveloped
in
silence
toki
who
had
for
some
time
been
in
the
king
service
had
by
his
deeds
surpassing
those
of
his
comrades
made
enemies
of
his
virtues
one
day
when
he
had
drunk
too
much
he
boasted
to
those
who
sat
at
table
with
him
that
his
skill
in
archery
was
such
that
with
the
first
shot
of
an
arrow
he
could
hit
the
smallest
apple
set
on
the
top
of
a
stick
at
a
considerable
distance
his
detractors
hearing
this
lost
no
time
in
conveying
what
he
had
said
to
the
king
harald
bluetooth
but
the
wickedness
of
this
monarch
soon
transformed
the
confidence
of
the
father
to
the
jeopardy
of
the
son
for
he
ordered
the
dearest
pledge
of
his
life
to
stand
in
place
of
the
stick
from
whom
if
the
utterer
of
the
boast
did
not
at
his
first
shot
strike
down
the
apple
he
should
with
his
head
pay
the
penalty
of
having
made
an
idle
boast
the
command
of
the
king
urged
the
soldier
to
do
this
which
was
so
much
more
than
he
had
undertaken
the
detracting
artifices
of
the
others
having
taken
advantage
of
words
spoken
when
he
was
hardly
sober
as
soon
as
the
boy
was
led
forth
toki
carefully
admonished
him
to
receive
the
whir
of
the
arrow
as
calmly
as
possible
with
attentive
ears
and
without
moving
his
head
lest
by
a
slight
motion
of
the
body
he
should
frustrate
the
experience
of
his
skill
he
also
made
him
stand
with
his
back
towards
him
lest
he
should
be
frightened
at
the
sight
of
the
arrow
then
he
drew
three
arrows
from
his
quiver
and
the
very
first
he
shot
struck
the
proposed
mark
toki
being
asked
by
the
king
why
he
had
taken
so
many
more
arrows
out
of
his
quiver
when
he
was
to
make
but
one
trial
with
his
bow
i
might
avenge
on
thee
he
replied
error
of
the
first
by
the
points
of
the
others
lest
my
innocence
might
happen
to
be
afflicted
and
thy
injustice
go
unpunished
the
same
incident
is
told
of
egil
brother
of
the
mythical
velundr
in
the
saga
of
thidrik
in
norwegian
history
also
it
appears
with
variations
again
and
again
it
is
told
of
king
olaf
the
saint
that
desiring
the
conversion
of
a
brave
heathen
named
eindridi
he
competed
with
him
in
various
athletic
sports
he
swam
with
him
wrestled
and
then
shot
with
him
the
king
dared
eindridi
to
strike
a
from
off
his
son
head
with
an
arrow
eindridi
prepared
to
attempt
the
difficult
shot
the
king
bade
two
men
bind
the
eyes
of
the
child
and
hold
the
napkin
so
that
he
might
not
move
when
he
heard
the
whistle
of
the
arrow
the
king
aimed
first
and
the
arrow
grazed
the
head
eindridi
then
prepared
to
shoot
but
the
mother
of
the
boy
interfered
and
persuaded
the
king
to
abandon
this
dangerous
test
of
skill
in
this
version
also
eindridi
is
prepared
to
revenge
himself
on
the
king
should
the
child
be
injured
but
a
closer
approximation
still
to
the
tell
myth
is
found
in
the
life
of
hemingr
another
norse
archer
who
was
challenged
by
king
harald
sigurd
son
the
story
is
thus
told
the
island
was
densely
overgrown
with
wood
and
the
people
went
into
the
forest
the
king
took
a
spear
and
set
it
with
its
point
in
the
soil
then
he
laid
an
arrow
on
the
string
and
shot
up
into
the
air
the
arrow
turned
in
the
air
and
came
down
upon
the
and
stood
up
in
it
hemingr
took
another
arrow
and
shot
up
his
was
lost
to
sight
for
some
while
but
it
came
back
and
pierced
the
nick
of
the
king
arrow
then
the
king
took
a
knife
and
stuck
it
into
an
oak
he
next
drew
his
bow
and
planted
an
arrow
in
the
haft
of
the
knife
thereupon
hemingr
took
his
arrows
the
king
stood
by
him
and
said
are
all
inlaid
with
gold
you
are
a
capital
workman
hemingr
answered
are
not
my
manufacture
but
are
presents
he
shot
and
his
arrow
cleft
the
haft
and
the
point
entered
the
socket
of
the
blade
must
have
a
keener
contest
said
the
king
taking
an
arrow
and
flushing
with
anger
then
he
laid
the
arrow
on
the
string
and
drew
his
bow
to
the
farthest
so
that
the
horns
were
nearly
brought
to
meet
away
flashed
the
arrow
and
pierced
a
tender
twig
all
said
that
this
was
a
most
astonishing
feat
of
dexterity
but
hemingr
shot
from
a
greater
distance
and
split
a
hazel
nut
all
were
astonished
to
see
this
then
said
the
king
a
nut
and
set
it
on
the
head
of
your
brother
bjorn
and
aim
at
it
from
precisely
the
same
distance
if
you
miss
the
mark
then
your
life
goes
hemingr
answered
my
life
is
at
your
disposal
but
i
will
not
adventure
that
shot
then
out
spake
bjorn
brother
rather
than
die
yourself
hemingr
said
you
the
pluck
to
stand
quite
still
without
shrinking
will
do
my
best
said
bjorn
let
the
king
stand
by
said
hemingr
let
him
see
whether
i
touch
the
nut
the
king
agreed
and
bade
oddr
ufeigs
son
stand
by
bjorn
and
see
that
the
shot
was
fair
hemingr
then
went
to
the
spot
fixed
for
him
by
the
king
and
signed
himself
with
the
cross
saying
be
my
witness
that
i
had
rather
die
myself
than
injure
my
brother
bjorn
let
all
the
blame
rest
on
king
harald
then
hemingr
flung
his
spear
the
spear
went
straight
to
the
mark
and
passed
between
the
nut
and
the
crown
of
the
lad
who
was
not
in
the
least
injured
it
flew
farther
and
stopped
not
till
it
fell
then
the
king
came
up
and
asked
oddr
what
he
thought
about
the
shot
years
after
this
risk
was
revenged
upon
the
monarch
in
the
battle
of
stamfordbridge
an
arrow
from
a
skilled
archer
penetrated
the
windpipe
of
the
king
and
it
is
supposed
to
have
sped
observes
the
saga
writer
from
the
bow
of
hemingr
then
in
the
service
of
the
english
monarch
the
story
is
related
somewhat
differently
in
the
faroe
isles
and
is
told
of
geyti
aslak
son
the
same
harald
asks
his
men
if
they
know
who
is
his
match
in
strength
yes
they
reply
there
is
a
son
in
the
uplands
geyti
son
of
aslak
who
is
the
strongest
of
men
forth
goes
the
king
and
at
last
rides
up
to
the
house
of
aslak
and
where
is
your
youngest
son
alas
alas
he
lies
under
the
green
sod
of
kolrin
kirkgarth
come
then
and
show
me
his
corpse
old
man
that
i
may
judge
whether
he
was
as
stout
of
limb
as
men
say
the
father
puts
the
king
off
with
the
excuse
that
among
so
many
dead
it
would
be
hard
to
find
his
boy
so
the
king
rides
away
over
the
heath
he
meets
a
stately
man
returning
from
the
chase
with
a
bow
over
his
shoulder
and
who
art
thou
friend
geyti
aslak
son
the
dead
man
in
short
alive
and
well
the
king
tells
him
he
has
heard
of
his
prowess
and
is
come
to
match
his
strength
with
him
so
geyti
and
the
king
try
a
the
king
swims
well
but
geyti
swims
better
and
in
the
end
gives
the
monarch
such
a
ducking
that
he
is
borne
to
his
house
devoid
of
sense
and
motion
harald
swallows
his
anger
as
he
had
swallowed
the
water
and
bids
geyti
shoot
a
hazel
nut
from
off
his
brother

son
consents
and
invites
the
king
into
the
forest
to
witness
his
dexterity
on
the
string
the
shaft
he
laid
and
god
hath
heard
his
prayer
he
shot
the
little
nut
away
nor
hurt
the
lad

hair
next
day
the
king
sends
for
the
skilful
bowman
list
thee
geyti
aslak
son
and
truly
tell
to
me
wherefore
hadst
thou
arrows

replies
therefore
had

arrows
twain
yestreen
in
the
wood
with
me
had
i
but
hurt
my
brother
dear
the
other
had
piercéd
thee
a
very
similar
tale
is
told
also
in
the
celebrated
malleus
maleficarum
of
a
man
named
puncher
with
this
difference
that
a
coin
is
placed
on
the
lad
head
instead
of
an
apple
or
a
nut
the
person
who
had
dared
puncher
to
the
test
of
skill
inquires
the
use
of
the
second
arrow
in
his
belt
and
receives
the
usual
answer
that
if
the
first
arrow
had
missed
the
coin
the
second
would
have
transfixed
a
certain
heart
which
was
destitute
of
natural
feeling
we
have
moreover
our
english
version
of
the
same
story
in
the
venerable
ballad
of
william
of
cloudsley
the
finn
ethnologist
castrén
obtained
the
following
tale
in
the
finnish
village
of
uhtuwa
a
fight
took
place
between
some
freebooters
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
of
alajäwi
the
robbers
plundered
every
house
and
carried
off
amongst
their
captives
an
old
man
as
they
proceeded
with
their
spoils
along
the
strand
of
the
lake
a
lad
of
twelve
years
old
appeared
from
among
the
reeds
on
the
opposite
bank
armed
with
a
bow
and
amply
provided
with
arrows
he
threatened
to
shoot
down
the
captors
unless
the
old
man
his
father
were
restored
to
him
the
robbers
mockingly
replied
that
the
aged
man
would
be
given
to
him
if
he
could
shoot
an
apple
off
his
head
the
boy
accepted
the
challenge
and
on
successfully
accomplishing
it
the
surrender
of
the
venerable
captive
was
made
âttar
was
a
persian
dealer
in
perfumes
born
in
the
year
he
one
day
was
so
impressed
with
the
sight
of
a
dervish
that
he
sold
his
possessions
and
followed
righteousness
he
composed
the
poem
mantic
uttaïr
or
the
language
of
birds
observe
the
persian
âttar
lived
at
the
same
time
as
the
danish
saxo
and
long
before
the
birth
of
tell
curiously
enough
we
find
a
trace
of
the
tell
myth
in
the
pages
of
his
poem
according
to
him
however
the
king
shoots
the
apple
from
the
head
of
a
beloved
page
and
the
lad
dies
from
sheer
fright
though
the
arrow
does
not
even
graze
his
skin
the
coincidence
of
finding
so
many
versions
of
the
same
story
scattered
through
countries
as
remote
as
persia
and
iceland
switzerland
and
denmark
proves
i
think
that
it
can
in
no
way
be
regarded
as
history
but
is
rather
one
of
the
numerous
household
myths
common
to
the
whole
stock
of
aryan
nations
probably
some
one
more
acquainted
with
sanskrit
literature
than
myself
and
with
better
access
to
its
unpublished
stores
of
fable
and
legend
will
some
day
light
on
an
early
indian
tale
corresponding
to
that
so
prevalent
among
other
branches
of
the
same
family
the
coincidence
of
the
tell
myth
being
discovered
among
the
finns
is
attributable
to
russian
or
swedish
influence
i
do
not
regard
it
as
a
primeval
turanian
but
as
an
aryan
story
which
like
an
erratic
block
is
found
deposited
on
foreign
soil
far
from
the
mountain
whence
it
was
torn
german
mythologists
i
suppose
consider
the
myth
to
represent
the
manifestation
of
some
natural
phenomena
and
the
individuals
of
the
story
to
be
impersonifications
of
natural
forces
most
primeval
stories
were
thus
constructed
and
their
origin
is
traceable
enough
in
for
instance
who
can
fail
to
see
the
earth
goddess
represented
by
the
sleeping
beauty
in
her
long
winter
slumber
only
returning
to
life
when
kissed
by
the
phœbus
or
baldur
but
the
tell
myth
has
not
its
signification
thus
painted
on
the
surface
and
those
who
suppose
gessler
or
harald
to
be
the
power
of
evil
and
darkness
the
bold
archer
to
be
the
with
his
arrow
of
lightning
and
his
iris
bow
bent
against
the
sun
which
is
resting
like
a
coin
or
a
golden
apple
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
are
their
theories
and
exacting
too
much
from
our
credulity
in
these
pages
and
elsewhere
i
have
shown
how
some
of
the
ancient
myths
related
by
the
whole
aryan
family
of
nations
are
reducible
to
allegorical
explanations
of
certain
natural
phenomena
but
i
must
protest
against
the
manner
in
which
our
german
friends
fasten
rapaciously
upon
every
atom
of
history
sacred
and
profane
and
demonstrate
all
heroes
to
represent
the
sun
all
villains
to
be
the
demons
of
night
or
winter
all
sticks
and
spears
and
arrows
to
be
the
lightning
all
cows
and
sheep
and
dragons
and
swans
to
be
clouds
in
a
work
on
the
superstition
of
werewolves
i
have
entered
into
this
subject
with
some
fulness
and
am
quite
prepared
to
admit
the
premises
upon
which
mythologists
construct
their
theories
at
the
same
time
i
am
not
disposed
to
run
to
the
extravagant
lengths
reached
by
some
of
the
most
enthusiastic
german
scholars
a
wholesome
warning
to
these
gentlemen
was
given
some
years
ago
by
an
ingenious
french
ecclesiastic
who
wrote
the
following
argument
to
prove
that
napoleon
bonaparte
was
a
mythological
character
archbishop
whately
historic
doubts
was
grounded
on
a
totally
different
line
of
argument
i
subjoin
the
other
as
a
curiosity
and
as
a
caution
napoleon
is
says
the
writer
an
impersonification
of
the
sun
between
the
name
napoleon
and
apollo
or
apoleon
the
god
of
the
sun
there
is
but
a
trifling
difference
indeed
the
seeming
difference
is
lessened
if
we
take
the
spelling
of
his
name
from
the
column
of
the
place
vendôme
where
it
stands
néapoleó
but
this
syllable
prefixed
to
the
name
of
the
is
of
importance
like
the
rest
of
the
name
it
is
of
greek
origin
and
is
νη
or
ναι
a
particle
of
affirmation
as
though
indicating
napoleon
as
the
very
true
apollo
or
sun
his
other
name
bonaparte
makes
this
apparent
connection
between
the
french
hero
and
the
luminary
of
the
firmament
conclusively
certain
the
day
has
its
two
parts
the
good
and
luminous
portion
and
that
which
is
bad
and
dark
to
the
sun
belongs
the
good
part
to
the
moon
and
stars
belongs
the
bad
portion
it
is
therefore
natural
that
apollo
or
should
receive
the
surname
of
apollo
was
born
in
delos
a
mediterranean
island
napoleon
in
corsica
an
island
in
the
same
sea
according
to
pausanias
apollo
was
an
egyptian
deity
and
in
the
mythological
history
of
the
fabulous
napoleon
we
find
the
hero
in
egypt
regarded
by
the
inhabitants
with
veneration
and
receiving
their
homage
the
mother
of
napoleon
was
said
to
be
letitia
which
signifies
joy
and
is
an
impersonification
of
the
dawn
of
light
dispensing
joy
and
gladness
to
all
creation
letitia
is
no
other
than
the
break
of
day
which
in
a
manner
brings
the
sun
into
the
world
and
with
rosy
fingers
opes
the
gates
of
day
it
is
significant
that
the
greek
name
for
the
mother
of
apollo
was
leto
from
this
the
romans
made
the
name
latona
which
they
gave
to
his
mother
but
is
the
unused
form
of
the
verb
and
signified
to
inspire
joy
it
is
from
this
unused
form
that
the
substantive
is
derived
the
identity
then
of
the
mother
of
napoleon
with
the
greek
leto
and
the
latin
latona
is
established
conclusively
according
to
the
popular
story
this
son
of
letitia
had
three
sisters
and
was
it
not
the
same
with
the
greek
deity
who
had
the
three
graces
the
modern
gallic
apollo
had
four
brothers
it
is
impossible
not
to
discern
here
the
anthropomorphosis
of
the
four
seasons
but
it
will
be
objected
the
seasons
should
be
females
here
the
french
language
interposes
for
in
french
the
seasons
are
masculine
with
the
exception
of
autumn
upon
the
gender
of
which
grammarians
are
undecided
whilst
autumnus
in
latin
is
not
more
feminine
than
the
other
seasons
this
difficulty
is
therefore
trifling
and
what
follows
removes
all
shadow
of
doubt
of
the
four
brothers
of
napoleon
three
are
said
to
have
been
kings
and
these
of
course
are
spring
reigning
over
the
flowers
summer
reigning
over
the
harvest
autumn
holding
sway
over
the
fruits
and
as
these
three
seasons
owe
all
to
the
powerful
influence
of
the
sun
we
are
told
in
the
popular
myth
that
the
three
brothers
of
napoleon
drew
their
authority
from
him
and
received
from
him
their
kingdoms
but
if
it
be
added
that
of
the
four
brothers
of
napoleon
one
was
not
a
king
that
was
because
he
is
the
impersonification
of
winter
which
has
no
reign
over
anything
if
however
it
be
asserted
in
contradiction
that
the
winter
has
an
empire
he
will
be
given
the
principality
over
snows
and
frosts
which
in
the
dreary
season
of
the
year
whiten
the
face
of
the
earth
well
the
fourth
brother
of
napoleon
is
thus
invested
by
popular
tradition
commonly
called
history
with
a
vain
principality
accorded
to
him
the
decline
of
the
power
of
the
principality
was
that
of
canino
a
name
derived
from
or
the
whitened
hairs
of
a
frozen
old
age
true
emblem
of
winter
to
the
eyes
of
poets
the
forests
covering
the
hills
are
their
hair
and
when
winter
frosts
them
they
represent
the
snowy
locks
of
a
decrepit
nature
in
the
old
age
of
the
year
cum
gelidus
crescit
in
montibus
humor
consequently
the
prince
of
canino
is
an
impersonification
of
winter
winter
whose
reign
begins
when
the
kingdoms
of
the
three
fine
seasons
are
passed
from
them
and
when
the
sun
is
driven
from
his
power
by
the
children
of
the
north
as
the
poets
call
the
boreal
winds
this
is
the
origin
of
the
fabulous
invasion
of
france
by
the
allied
armies
of
the
north
the
story
relates
that
these
invaders
the
northern
gales
banished
the
flag
and
replaced
it
by
a
white
standard
this
too
is
a
graceful
but
at
the
same
time
purely
fabulous
account
of
the
northern
winds
driving
all
the
brilliant
colors
from
the
face
of
the
soil
to
replace
them
by
the
snowy
sheet
napoleon
is
said
to
have
had
two
wives
it
is
well
known
that
the
classic
fable
gave
two
also
to
apollo
these
two
were
the
moon
and
the
earth
plutarch
asserts
that
the
greeks
gave
the
moon
to
apollo
for
wife
whilst
the
egyptians
attributed
to
him
the
earth
by
the
moon
he
had
no
posterity
but
by
the
other
he
had
one
son
only
the
little
horus
this
is
an
egyptian
allegory
representing
the
fruits
of
agriculture
produced
by
the
earth
fertilized
by
the
sun
the
pretended
son
of
the
fabulous
napoleon
is
said
to
have
been
born
on
the
of
march
the
season
of
the
spring
equinox
when
agriculture
is
assuming
its
greatest
period
of
activity
napoleon
is
said
to
have
released
france
from
the
devastating
scourge
which
terrorized
over
the
country
the
hydra
of
the
revolution
as
it
was
popularly
called
who
can
not
see
in
this
a
gallic
version
of
the
greek
legend
of
apollo
releasing
hellas
from
the
terrible
python
the
very
name
derived
from
the
latin
verb
is
indicative
of
the
coils
of
a
serpent
like
the
python
the
famous
hero
of
the
century
had
it
is
asserted
twelve
marshals
at
the
head
of
his
armies
and
four
who
were
stationary
and
inactive
the
twelve
first
as
may
be
seen
at
once
are
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
marching
under
the
orders
of
the
sun
napoleon
and
each
commanding
a
division
of
the
innumerable
host
of
stars
which
are
parted
into
twelve
portions
corresponding
to
the
twelve
signs
as
for
the
four
stationary
officers
immovable
in
the
midst
of
general
motion
they
are
the
cardinal
points
it
is
currently
reported
that
the
chief
of
these
brilliant
armies
after
having
gloriously
traversed
the
southern
kingdoms
penetrated
north
and
was
there
unable
to
maintain
his
sway
this
too
represents
the
course
of
the
sun
which
assumes
its
greatest
power
in
the
south
but
after
the
spring
equinox
seeks
to
reach
the
north
and
after
a
march
towards
the
boreal
regions
is
driven
back
upon
his
traces
following
the
sign
of
cancer
a
sign
given
to
represent
the
retrogression
of
the
sun
in
that
portion
of
the
sphere
it
is
on
this
that
the
story
of
the
march
of
napoleon
towards
moscow
and
his
humbling
retreat
is
founded
finally
the
sun
rises
in
the
east
and
sets
in
the
western
sea
the
poets
picture
him
rising
out
of
the
waters
in
the
east
and
setting
in
the
ocean
after
his
twelve
hours
reign
in
the
sky
such
is
the
history
of
napoleon
coming
from
his
mediterranean
isle
holding
the
reins
of
government
for
twelve
years
and
finally
disappearing
in
the
mysterious
regions
of
the
great
atlantic
to
those
who
see
in
samson
the
image
of
the
sun
the
correlative
of
the
classic
hercules
this
clever
skit
of
the
accomplished
french
abbé
may
prove
of
value
as
a
caution
footnote
this
anecdote
is
taken
from
the
de
may
but
whence
did
the
obtain
it
the
dog
gellert
having
demolished
william
tell
i
proceed
to
the
destruction
of
another
article
of
popular
belief
who
that
has
visited
snowdon
has
not
seen
the
grave
of
faithful
hound
gellert
and
been
told
by
the
guide
the
touching
story
of
the
death
of
the
noble
animal
how
can
we
doubt
the
facts
seeing
that
the
place
is
named
after
the
dog
and
that
the
grave
is
still
visible
but
unfortunately
for
the
truth
of
the
legend
its
pedigree
can
be
traced
with
the
utmost
precision
the
story
is
as
follows
the
welsh
prince
llewellyn
had
a
noble
deerhound
gellert
whom
he
trusted
to
watch
the
cradle
of
his
baby
son
whilst
he
himself
was
absent
one
day
on
his
return
to
his
intense
horror
he
beheld
the
cradle
empty
and
upset
the
clothes
dabbled
with
blood
and
gellert
mouth
dripping
with
gore
concluding
hastily
that
the
hound
had
proved
unfaithful
had
fallen
on
the
child
and
devoured
it
in
a
paroxysm
of
rage
the
prince
drew
his
sword
and
slew
the
dog
next
instant
the
cry
of
the
babe
from
behind
the
cradle
showed
him
that
the
child
was
uninjured
and
on
looking
farther
llewellyn
discovered
the
body
of
a
huge
wolf
which
had
entered
the
house
to
seize
and
devour
the
child
but
which
had
been
kept
off
and
killed
by
the
brave
dog
gellert
in
his
and
grief
the
prince
erected
a
stately
monument
to
gellert
and
called
the
place
where
he
was
buried
after
the
poor
hound
name
now
i
find
in
russia
precisely
the
same
story
told
with
just
the
same
appearance
of
truth
of
a
czar
piras
in
germany
it
appears
with
considerable
variations
a
man
determines
on
slaying
his
old
dog
sultan
and
consults
with
his
wife
how
this
is
to
be
effected
sultan
overhears
the
conversation
and
complains
bitterly
to
the
wolf
who
suggests
an
ingenious
plan
by
which
the
master
may
be
induced
to
spare
his
dog
next
day
when
the
man
is
going
to
his
work
the
wolf
undertakes
to
carry
off
the
child
from
its
cradle
sultan
is
to
attack
him
and
rescue
the
infant
the
plan
succeeds
admirably
and
the
dog
spends
his
remaining
years
in
comfort
grimm
m
but
there
is
a
story
in
closer
conformity
to
that
of
gellert
among
the
french
collections
of
fabliaux
made
by
le
grand
and
edéléstand
du
méril
it
became
popular
through
the
gesta
romanorum
a
collection
of
tales
made
by
the
monks
for
harmless
reading
in
the
fourteenth
century
in
the
gesta
the
tale
is
told
as
follows
folliculus
a
knight
was
fond
of
hunting
and
tournaments
he
had
an
only
son
for
whom
three
nurses
were
provided
next
to
this
child
he
loved
his
falcon
and
his
greyhound
it
happened
one
day
that
he
was
called
to
a
tournament
whither
his
wife
and
domestics
went
also
leaving
the
child
in
the
cradle
the
greyhound
lying
by
him
and
the
falcon
on
his
perch
a
serpent
that
inhabited
a
hole
near
the
castle
taking
advantage
of
the
profound
silence
that
reigned
crept
from
his
habitation
and
advanced
towards
the
cradle
to
devour
the
child
the
falcon
perceiving
the
danger
fluttered
with
his
wings
till
he
awoke
the
dog
who
instantly
attacked
the
invader
and
after
a
fierce
conflict
in
which
he
was
sorely
wounded
killed
him
he
then
lay
down
on
the
ground
to
lick
and
heal
his
wounds
when
the
nurses
returned
they
found
the
cradle
overturned
the
child
thrown
out
and
the
ground
covered
with
blood
as
was
also
the
dog
who
they
immediately
concluded
had
killed
the
child
terrified
at
the
idea
of
meeting
the
anger
of
the
parents
they
determined
to
escape
but
in
their
flight
fell
in
with
their
mistress
to
whom
they
were
compelled
to
relate
the
supposed
murder
of
the
child
by
the
greyhound
the
knight
soon
arrived
to
hear
the
sad
story
and
maddened
with
fury
rushed
forward
to
the
spot
the
poor
wounded
and
faithful
animal
made
an
effort
to
rise
and
welcome
his
master
with
his
accustomed
fondness
but
the
enraged
knight
received
him
on
the
point
of
his
sword
and
he
fell
lifeless
to
the
ground
on
examination
of
the
cradle
the
infant
was
found
alive
and
unhurt
with
the
dead
serpent
lying
by
him
the
knight
now
perceived
what
had
happened
lamented
bitterly
over
his
faithful
dog
and
blamed
himself
for
having
too
hastily
depended
on
the
words
of
his
wife
abandoning
the
profession
of
arms
he
broke
his
lance
in
pieces
and
vowed
a
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
land
where
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
days
in
peace
the
monkish
hit
at
the
wife
is
amusing
and
might
have
been
supposed
to
have
originated
with
those
determined
misogynists
as
the
gallant
welshmen
lay
all
the
blame
on
the
man
but
the
good
compilers
of
the
gesta
wrote
little
of
their
own
except
moral
applications
of
the
tales
they
relate
and
the
story
of
folliculus
and
his
dog
like
many
others
in
their
collection
is
drawn
from
a
foreign
source
it
occurs
in
the
seven
wise
masters
and
in
the
calumnia
novercalis
as
well
so
that
it
must
have
been
popular
throughout
mediæval
europe
now
the
tales
of
the
seven
wise
masters
are
translations
from
a
hebrew
work
the
kalilah
and
dimnah
of
rabbi
joel
composed
about
or
from
simeon
seth
greek
kylile
and
dimne
written
in
these
greek
and
hebrew
works
were
derived
from
kindred
sources
that
of
rabbi
joel
was
a
translation
from
an
arabic
version
made
by
in
the
twelfth
century
whilst
simeon
seth
was
a
translation
of
the
persian
kalilah
and
dimnah
but
the
persian
kalilah
and
dimnah
was
not
either
an
original
work
it
was
in
turn
a
translation
from
the
sanskrit
pantschatantra
made
about
in
this
ancient
indian
book
the
story
runs
as
follows
a
brahmin
named
devasaman
had
a
wife
who
gave
birth
to
a
son
and
also
to
an
ichneumon
she
loved
both
her
children
dearly
giving
them
alike
the
breast
and
anointing
them
alike
with
salves
but
she
feared
the
ichneumon
might
not
love
his
brother
one
day
having
laid
her
boy
in
bed
she
took
up
the
water
jar
and
said
to
her
husband
hear
me
master
i
am
going
to
the
tank
to
fetch
water
whilst
i
am
absent
watch
the
boy
lest
he
gets
injured
by
the
ichneumon
after
she
had
left
the
house
the
brahmin
went
forth
begging
leaving
the
house
empty
in
crept
a
black
snake
and
attempted
to
bite
the
child
but
the
ichneumon
rushed
at
it
and
tore
it
in
pieces
then
proud
of
its
achievement
it
sallied
forth
all
bloody
to
meet
its
mother
she
seeing
the
creature
stained
with
blood
concluded
with
feminine
precipitance
that
it
had
fallen
on
the
baby
and
killed
it
and
she
flung
her
water
jar
at
it
and
slew
it
only
on
her
return
home
did
she
ascertain
her
mistake
the
same
story
is
also
told
in
the
hitopadesa
iv
but
the
animal
is
an
otter
not
an
ichneumon
in
the
arabic
version
a
weasel
takes
the
place
of
the
ichneumon
the
buddhist
missionaries
carried
the
story
into
mongolia
and
in
the
mongolian
uligerun
which
is
a
translation
of
the
tibetian
dsanghen
the
story
reappears
with
the
as
the
brave
and
suffering
defender
of
the
child
stanislaus
julien
the
great
chinese
scholar
has
discovered
the
same
tale
in
the
chinese
work
entitled
the
forest
of
pearls
from
the
garden
of
the
law
this
work
dates
from
and
in
it
the
creature
is
an
ichneumon
in
the
persian
is
the
same
tale
but
the
faithful
animal
is
a
cat
in
sandabar
and
syntipas
it
has
become
a
dog
through
the
influence
of
sandabar
on
the
hebrew
translation
of
the
kalilah
and
dimnah
the
ichneumon
is
also
replaced
by
a
dog
such
is
the
history
of
the
gellert
legend
it
is
an
introduction
into
europe
from
india
every
step
of
its
transmission
being
clearly
demonstrable
from
the
gesta
romanorum
it
passed
into
a
popular
tale
throughout
europe
and
in
different
countries
it
was
like
the
tell
myth
localized
and
individualized
many
a
welsh
story
such
as
those
contained
in
the
mabinogion
are
as
easily
traced
to
an
eastern
origin
but
every
story
has
its
root
the
root
of
the
gellert
tale
is
this
a
man
forms
an
alliance
of
friendship
with
a
beast
or
bird
the
dumb
animal
renders
him
a
signal
service
he
misunderstands
the
act
and
kills
his
preserver
we
have
tracked
this
myth
under
the
gellert
form
from
india
to
wales
but
under
another
form
it
is
the
property
of
the
whole
aryan
family
and
forms
a
portion
of
the
traditional
lore
of
all
nations
sprung
from
that
stock
thence
arose
the
classic
fable
of
the
peasant
who
as
he
slept
was
bitten
by
a
fly
he
awoke
and
in
a
rage
killed
the
insect
when
too
late
he
observed
that
the
little
creature
had
aroused
him
that
he
might
avoid
a
snake
which
lay
coiled
up
near
his
pillow
in
the
is
the
following
kindred
tale
a
king
had
a
falcon
one
day
whilst
hunting
he
filled
a
goblet
with
water
dropping
from
a
rock
as
he
put
the
vessel
to
his
lips
his
falcon
dashed
upon
it
and
upset
it
with
its
wings
the
king
in
a
fury
slew
the
bird
and
then
discovered
that
the
water
dripped
from
the
jaws
of
a
serpent
of
the
most
poisonous
description
this
story
with
some
variations
occurs
in
æsop
ælian
and
apthonius
in
the
greek
fable
a
peasant
liberates
an
eagle
from
the
clutches
of
a
dragon
the
dragon
spirts
poison
into
the
water
which
the
peasant
is
about
to
drink
without
observing
what
the
monster
had
done
the
grateful
eagle
upsets
the
goblet
with
his
wings
the
story
appears
in
egypt
under
a
whimsical
form
a
wali
once
smashed
a
pot
full
of
herbs
which
a
cook
had
prepared
the
exasperated
cook
thrashed
the
but
unfortunate
wali
within
an
inch
of
his
life
and
when
he
returned
exhausted
with
his
efforts
at
belaboring
the
man
to
examine
the
broken
pot
he
discovered
amongst
the
herbs
a
poisonous
snake
how
many
brothers
sisters
uncles
aunts
and
cousins
of
all
degrees
a
little
story
has
and
how
few
of
the
tales
we
listen
to
can
lay
any
claim
to
originality
there
is
scarcely
a
story
which
i
hear
which
i
can
not
connect
with
some
family
of
myths
and
whose
pedigree
i
can
not
ascertain
with
more
or
less
precision
shakespeare
drew
the
plots
of
his
plays
from
boccaccio
or
straparola
but
these
italians
did
not
invent
the
tales
they
lent
to
the
english
dramatist
king
lear
does
not
originate
with
geofry
of
monmouth
but
comes
from
early
indian
stores
of
fable
whence
also
are
derived
the
merchant
of
venice
and
the
pound
of
flesh
ay
and
the
very
incident
of
the
three
caskets
but
who
would
credit
it
were
it
not
proved
by
conclusive
facts
that
johnny
sands
is
the
inheritance
of
the
whole
aryan
family
of
nations
and
that
peeping
tom
of
coventry
peeped
in
india
and
on
the
tartar
steppes
ages
before
lady
godiva
was
born
if
you
listen
to
traviata
at
the
opera
you
have
set
before
you
a
tale
which
has
lasted
for
centuries
and
which
was
perhaps
born
in
india
if
you
read
in
classic
fable
of
orpheus
charming
woods
and
meadows
beasts
and
birds
with
his
magic
lyre
you
remember
to
have
seen
the
same
fable
related
in
the
kalewala
of
the
finnish
wainomainen
and
in
the
kaleopoeg
of
the
esthonian
kalewa
if
you
take
up
english
history
and
read
of
william
the
conqueror
slipping
as
he
landed
on
british
soil
and
kissing
the
earth
saying
he
had
come
to
greet
and
claim
his
own
you
remember
that
the
same
story
is
told
of
napoleon
in
egypt
of
king
olaf
harold
son
in
norway
and
in
classic
history
of
junius
brutus
on
his
return
from
the
oracle
a
little
while
ago
i
cut
out
of
a
sussex
newspaper
a
story
purporting
to
be
the
relation
of
a
fact
which
had
taken
place
at
a
fixed
date
in
lewes
this
was
the
story
a
tyrannical
husband
locked
the
door
against
his
wife
who
was
out
having
tea
with
a
neighbor
gossiping
and
when
she
applied
for
admittance
he
pretended
not
to
know
her
she
threatened
to
jump
into
the
well
unless
he
opened
the
door
the
man
not
supposing
that
she
would
carry
her
threat
into
execution
declined
alleging
that
he
was
in
bed
and
the
night
was
chilly
besides
which
he
entirely
disclaimed
all
acquaintance
with
the
lady
who
claimed
admittance
the
wife
then
flung
a
log
into
a
well
and
secreted
herself
behind
the
door
the
man
hearing
the
splash
fancied
that
his
good
lady
was
really
in
the
deeps
and
forth
he
darted
in
his
nocturnal
costume
which
was
of
the
lightest
to
ascertain
whether
his
deliverance
was
complete
at
once
the
lady
darted
into
the
house
locked
the
door
and
on
the
husband
pleading
for
admittance
she
declared
most
solemnly
from
the
window
that
she
did
not
know
now
this
story
i
can
positively
assert
unless
the
events
of
this
world
move
in
a
circle
did
not
happen
in
lewes
or
any
other
sussex
town
it
was
told
in
the
gesta
romanorum
six
hundred
years
ago
and
it
was
told
may
be
as
many
hundred
years
before
in
india
for
it
is
still
to
be
found
in
sanskrit
collections
of
tales
tailed
men
i
well
remember
having
it
impressed
upon
me
by
a
devonshire
nurse
as
a
little
child
that
all
cornishmen
were
born
with
tails
and
it
was
long
before
i
could
overcome
the
prejudice
thus
early
implanted
in
my
breast
against
my
cornubian
neighbors
i
looked
upon
those
who
dwelt
across
the
tamar
as
uncanny
as
being
scarcely
to
be
classed
with
christian
people
and
certainly
not
to
be
freely
associated
with
by
tailless
devonians
i
think
my
eyes
were
first
opened
to
the
fact
that
i
had
been
deceived
by
a
worthy
bookseller
of
l
with
whom
i
had
contracted
a
warm
friendship
he
having
at
sundry
times
contributed
pictures
to
my
scrapbook
i
remember
one
day
resolving
to
broach
the
delicate
subject
with
my
tailed
friend
whom
i
liked
notwithstanding
his
caudal
appendage
x
is
it
true
that
you
are
a
cornishman
yes
my
little
man
born
and
bred
in
the
west
country
i
like
you
very
much
but
have
you
really
got
a
tail
when
the
bookseller
had
recovered
from
the
astonishment
which
i
had
produced
by
my
question
he
stoutly
repudiated
the
charge
but
you
are
a
cornishman
to
be
sure
i
am
and
all
cornishmen
have
tails
i
believe
i
satisfied
my
own
mind
that
the
good
man
had
sat
his
off
and
my
nurse
assured
me
that
such
was
the
case
with
those
of
sedentary
habits
it
is
curious
that
devonshire
superstition
should
attribute
the
tail
to
cornishmen
for
it
was
asserted
of
certain
men
of
kent
in
olden
times
and
was
referred
to
divine
vengeance
upon
them
for
having
insulted
thomas
à
becket
if
we
may
believe
polydore
vergil
there
were
some
he
says
to
whom
it
seemed
that
the
king
secret
wish
was
that
thomas
should
be
got
rid
of
he
indeed
as
one
accounted
to
be
an
enemy
of
the
king
person
was
already
regarded
with
so
little
respect
nay
was
treated
with
so
much
contempt
that
when
he
came
to
strood
which
village
is
situated
on
the
medway
the
river
that
washes
rochester
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
being
eager
to
show
some
mark
of
contumely
to
the
prelate
in
his
disgrace
did
not
scruple
to
cut
off
the
tail
of
the
horse
on
which
he
was
riding
but
by
this
profane
and
inhospitable
act
they
covered
themselves
with
eternal
reproach
for
it
so
happened
after
this
by
the
will
of
god
that
all
the
offspring
born
from
the
men
who
had
done
this
thing
were
born
with
tails
like
brute
animals
but
this
mark
of
infamy
which
formerly
was
everywhere
notorious
has
disappeared
with
the
extinction
of
the
race
whose
fathers
perpetrated
this
deed
john
bale
the
zealous
reformer
and
bishop
of
ossory
in
edward
vi
time
refers
to
this
story
and
also
mentions
a
variation
of
the
scene
and
cause
of
this
ignoble
punishment
he
writes
quoting
his
authorities
john
capgrave
and
alexander
of
esseby
sayth
that
for
castynge
of
fyshe
tayles
at
thys
augustyne
dorsettshyre
men
had
tayles
ever
after
but
polydorus
applieth
it
unto
kentish
men
at
stroud
by
rochester
for
cuttinge
off
thomas
becket
horse
tail
thus
hath
england
in
all
other
land
a
perpetual
infamy
of
tayles
by
theye
wrytten
legendes
of
lyes
yet
can
they
not
well
tell
where
to
bestowe
them
truely
bale
a
fierce
and
unsparing
reformer
and
one
who
stinted
not
hard
words
applying
to
the
inventors
of
these
legends
an
epithet
more
strong
than
elegant
says
in
the
legends
of
their
sanctified
sorcerers
they
have
diffamed
the
english
posterity
with
tails
as
has
been
showed
afore
that
an
englyshman
now
can
not
travayle
in
another
land
by
way
of
marchandyse
or
any
other
honest
occupyinge
but
it
is
most
contumeliously
thrown
in
his
tethe
that
all
englyshmen
have
tails
that
uncomely
note
and
report
have
the
nation
gotten
without
recover
by
these
laisy
and
idle
lubbers
the
monkes
and
the
priestes
which
could
find
no
matters
to
advance
their
canonized
gains
by
or
their
saintes
as
they
call
them
but
manifest
lies
and
knaveries
andrew
marvel
also
makes
mention
of
this
strange
judgment
in
his
but
who
considers
right
will
find
indeed
is
holy
island
parts
us
not
the
tweed
nothing
but
clergy
could
us
two
seclude
no
scotch
was
ever
like
a
bishop
feud
all
litanys
in
this
have
wanted
faith
there
no
us
from
a
bishop
never
shall
calvin
pardoned
be
for
sales
never
for
burnet
sake
the
lauderdales
for
becket
sake
kent
always
shall
have
tails
it
may
be
remembered
that
lord
monboddo
a
scotch
judge
of
last
century
and
a
philosopher
of
some
repute
though
of
great
eccentricity
stoutly
maintained
the
theory
that
man
ought
to
have
a
tail
that
the
tail
is
a
and
that
the
abrupt
termination
of
the
spine
without
caudal
elongation
is
a
sad
blemish
in
the
origination
of
man
the
tail
the
point
in
which
man
is
inferior
to
the
brute
what
a
delicate
index
of
the
mind
it
is
how
it
expresses
the
passions
of
love
and
hate
how
nicely
it
gives
token
of
the
feelings
of
joy
or
fear
which
animate
the
soul
but
lord
monboddo
did
not
consider
that
what
the
tail
is
to
the
brute
that
the
eye
is
to
man
the
lack
of
one
member
is
supplied
by
the
other
i
can
tell
a
proud
man
by
his
eye
just
as
truly
as
if
he
stalked
past
one
with
erect
tail
and
anger
is
as
plainly
depicted
in
the
human
eye
as
in
the
tail
of
a
cat
i
know
a
sneak
by
his
cowering
glance
though
he
has
not
a
tail
between
his
legs
and
pleasure
is
evident
in
the
laughing
eye
without
there
being
any
necessity
for
a
wagging
brush
to
express
it
johnson
paid
a
visit
to
the
judge
and
knocked
on
the
head
his
theory
that
men
ought
to
have
tails
and
actually
were
born
with
them
occasionally
for
said
he
of
a
standing
fact
sir
there
ought
to
be
no
controversy
if
there
are
men
with
tails
catch
a
and
it
is
a
pity
to
see
lord
monboddo
publish
such
notions
as
he
has
done
a
man
of
sense
and
of
so
much
elegant
learning
there
would
be
little
in
a
fool
doing
it
we
should
only
laugh
but
when
a
wise
man
does
it
we
are
sorry
other
people
have
strange
notions
but
they
conceal
them
if
they
have
tails
they
hide
them
but
monboddo
is
as
jealous
of
his
tail
as
a
squirrel
and
yet
johnson
seems
to
have
been
tickled
with
the
idea
and
to
have
been
amused
with
the
notion
of
an
appendage
like
a
tail
being
regarded
as
the
complement
of
human
perfection
it
may
be
remembered
how
johnson
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
young
laird
of
col
during
his
highland
tour
and
how
pleased
he
was
with
him
col
says
he
is
a
noble
animal
he
is
as
complete
an
islander
as
the
mind
can
figure
he
is
a
farmer
a
sailor
a
hunter
a
fisher
he
will
run
you
down
a
dog
any
man
has
a
it
is
and
notwithstanding
all
his
aversion
to
puns
the
great
doctor
was
fain
to
yield
to
human
weakness
on
one
occasion
under
the
influence
of
the
mirth
which
monboddo
name
seems
to
have
excited
johnson
writes
to
thrale
of
a
party
he
had
met
one
night
which
he
thus
enumerates
there
were
smelt
and
the
bishop
of
asaph
who
comes
to
every
place
and
sir
joshua
and
lord
monboddo
and
ladies
of
there
is
a
polish
story
of
a
witch
who
made
a
girdle
of
human
skin
and
laid
it
across
the
threshold
of
a
door
where
a
was
being
held
on
the
bridal
pair
stepping
across
the
girdle
they
were
transformed
into
wolves
three
years
after
the
witch
sought
them
out
and
cast
over
them
dresses
of
fur
with
the
hair
turned
outward
whereupon
they
recovered
their
human
forms
but
unfortunately
the
dress
cast
over
the
bridegroom
was
too
scanty
and
did
not
extend
over
his
tail
so
that
when
he
was
restored
to
his
former
condition
he
retained
his
lupine
caudal
appendage
and
this
became
hereditary
in
his
family
so
that
all
poles
with
tails
are
lineal
descendants
of
the
ancestor
to
whom
this
little
misfortune
happened
john
struys
a
dutch
traveller
who
visited
the
isle
of
formosa
in
gives
a
curious
story
which
is
worth
transcribing
before
i
visited
this
island
he
writes
i
had
often
heard
tell
that
there
were
men
who
had
long
tails
like
brute
beasts
but
i
had
never
been
able
to
believe
it
and
i
regarded
it
as
a
thing
so
alien
to
our
nature
that
i
should
now
have
difficulty
in
accepting
it
if
my
own
senses
had
not
removed
from
me
every
pretence
for
doubting
the
fact
by
the
following
strange
adventure
the
inhabitants
of
formosa
being
used
to
see
us
were
in
the
habit
of
receiving
us
on
terms
which
left
nothing
to
apprehend
on
either
side
so
that
although
mere
foreigners
we
always
believed
ourselves
in
safety
and
had
grown
familiar
enough
to
ramble
at
large
without
an
escort
when
grave
experience
taught
us
that
in
so
doing
we
were
hazarding
too
much
as
some
of
our
party
were
one
day
taking
a
stroll
one
of
them
had
occasion
to
withdraw
about
a
stone
throw
from
the
rest
who
being
at
the
moment
engaged
in
an
eager
conversation
proceeded
without
heeding
the
disappearance
of
their
companion
after
a
while
however
his
absence
was
observed
and
the
party
paused
thinking
he
would
rejoin
them
they
waited
some
time
but
at
last
tired
of
the
delay
they
returned
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
they
remembered
to
have
seen
him
last
arriving
there
they
were
horrified
to
find
his
mangled
body
lying
on
the
ground
though
the
nature
of
the
lacerations
showed
that
he
had
not
had
to
suffer
long
ere
death
released
him
whilst
some
remained
to
watch
the
dead
body
others
went
off
in
search
of
the
murderer
and
these
had
not
gone
far
when
they
came
upon
a
man
of
peculiar
appearance
who
finding
himself
enclosed
by
the
exploring
party
so
as
to
make
escape
from
them
impossible
began
to
foam
with
rage
and
by
cries
and
wild
gesticulations
to
intimate
that
he
would
make
any
one
repent
the
attempt
who
should
venture
to
meddle
with
him
the
fierceness
of
his
desperation
for
a
time
kept
our
people
at
bay
but
as
his
fury
gradually
subsided
they
gathered
more
closely
round
him
and
at
length
seized
him
he
then
soon
made
them
understand
that
it
was
he
who
had
killed
their
comrade
but
they
could
not
learn
from
him
any
cause
for
this
conduct
as
the
crime
was
so
atrocious
and
if
allowed
to
pass
with
impunity
might
entail
even
more
serious
consequences
it
was
determined
to
burn
the
man
he
was
tied
up
to
a
stake
where
he
was
kept
for
some
hours
before
the
time
of
execution
arrived
it
was
then
that
i
beheld
what
i
had
never
thought
to
see
he
had
a
tail
more
than
a
foot
long
covered
with
red
hair
and
very
like
that
of
a
cow
when
he
saw
the
surprise
that
this
discovery
created
among
the
european
spectators
he
informed
us
that
his
tail
was
the
effect
of
climate
for
that
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
southern
side
of
the
island
where
they
then
were
were
provided
with
like
appendages
after
struys
hornemann
reported
that
between
the
gulf
of
benin
and
abyssinia
were
tailed
anthropophagi
named
by
the
natives
and
in
descouret
on
his
return
from
mecca
affirmed
that
such
was
a
common
report
and
added
that
they
had
long
arms
low
and
narrow
foreheads
long
and
erect
ears
and
slim
legs
harrison
in
his
highlands
of
ethiopia
alludes
to
the
common
belief
among
the
abyssinians
in
a
pygmy
race
of
this
nature
mm
arnault
and
vayssière
travellers
in
the
same
country
in
brought
the
subject
before
the
academy
of
sciences
in
de
castelnau
gave
additional
details
relative
to
an
expedition
against
these
tailed
men
the
he
says
were
sleeping
in
the
sun
the
haoussas
approached
and
falling
on
them
massacred
them
to
the
last
man
they
had
all
of
them
tails
forty
centimetres
long
and
from
two
to
three
in
diameter
this
organ
is
smooth
among
the
corpses
were
those
of
several
women
who
were
deformed
in
the
same
manner
in
all
other
particulars
the
men
were
precisely
like
all
other
negroes
they
are
of
a
deep
black
their
teeth
are
polished
their
bodies
not
tattooed
they
are
armed
with
clubs
and
javelins
in
war
they
utter
piercing
cries
they
cultivate
rice
maize
and
other
grain
they
are
fine
looking
men
and
their
hair
is
not
frizzled
another
abyssinian
traveller
writing
in
gives
the
following
account
from
the
lips
of
an
abyssinian
priest
at
the
distance
of
fifteen
days
journey
south
of
herrar
is
a
place
where
all
the
men
have
tails
the
length
of
a
palm
covered
with
hair
and
situated
at
the
extremity
of
the
spine
the
females
of
that
country
are
very
beautiful
and
are
tailless
i
have
seen
some
fifteen
of
these
people
at
besberah
and
i
am
positive
that
the
tail
is
natural
it
will
be
observed
that
there
is
a
discrepancy
between
the
accounts
of
de
castelnau
and
the
former
accords
tails
to
the
ladies
whilst
the
latter
denies
it
according
to
the
former
the
tail
is
smooth
according
to
the
latter
it
is
covered
with
hair
wolf
has
improved
on
this
in
his
travels
and
adventures
vol
ii
there
are
men
and
women
in
abyssinia
with
tails
like
dogs
and
horses
wolf
heard
also
from
a
great
many
abyssinians
and
armenians
and
wolf
is
convinced
of
the
truth
of
it
that
there
are
near
narea
in
abyssinia
people
men
and
women
with
large
tails
with
which
they
are
able
to
knock
down
a
horse
and
there
are
also
such
people
near
china
and
in
a
note
in
the
college
of
surgeons
at
dublin
may
still
be
seen
a
human
skeleton
with
a
tail
seven
inches
long
there
are
many
known
instances
of
this
elongation
of
the
caudal
vertebra
as
in
the
poonangs
in
borneo
but
the
most
interesting
and
circumstantial
account
of
the
is
that
given
by
hubsch
physician
to
the
hospitals
of
constantinople
it
was
in
says
he
that
i
saw
for
the
first
time
a
tailed
negress
i
was
struck
with
this
phenomenon
and
i
questioned
her
master
a
slave
dealer
i
learned
from
him
that
there
exists
a
tribe
called
occupying
the
interior
of
africa
all
the
members
of
this
tribe
bear
the
caudal
appendage
and
as
oriental
imagination
is
given
to
exaggeration
i
was
assured
that
the
tails
sometimes
attained
the
length
of
two
feet
that
which
i
observed
was
smooth
and
hairless
it
was
about
two
inches
long
and
terminated
in
a
point
this
woman
was
as
black
as
ebony
her
hair
was
frizzled
her
teeth
white
large
and
planted
in
sockets
which
inclined
considerably
outward
her
four
canine
teeth
were
filed
her
eyes
bloodshot
she
ate
meat
raw
her
clothes
fidgeted
her
her
intellect
was
on
a
par
with
that
of
others
of
her
condition
her
master
had
been
unable
during
six
months
to
sell
her
notwithstanding
the
low
figure
at
which
he
would
have
disposed
of
her
the
abhorrence
with
which
she
was
regarded
was
not
attributed
to
her
tail
but
to
the
partiality
which
she
was
unable
to
conceal
for
human
flesh
her
tribe
fed
on
the
flesh
of
the
prisoners
taken
from
the
neighboring
tribes
with
whom
they
were
constantly
at
war
as
soon
as
one
of
the
tribe
dies
his
relations
instead
of
burying
him
cut
him
up
and
regale
themselves
upon
his
remains
consequently
there
are
no
cemeteries
in
this
land
they
do
not
all
of
them
lead
a
wandering
life
but
many
of
them
construct
hovels
of
the
branches
of
trees
they
make
for
themselves
weapons
of
war
and
of
agriculture
they
cultivate
maize
and
wheat
and
keep
cattle
the
have
a
language
of
their
own
of
an
entirely
primitive
character
though
containing
an
infusion
of
arabic
words
they
live
in
a
state
of
complete
nudity
and
seek
only
to
satisfy
their
brute
appetites
there
is
among
them
an
utter
disregard
for
morality
incest
and
adultery
being
common
the
strongest
among
them
becomes
the
chief
of
the
tribe
and
it
is
he
who
apportions
the
shares
of
the
booty
obtained
in
war
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
they
have
any
religion
but
in
all
probability
they
have
none
as
they
readily
adopt
any
one
which
they
are
taught
it
is
difficult
to
tame
them
altogether
their
instinct
impelling
them
constantly
to
seek
for
human
flesh
and
instances
are
related
of
slaves
who
have
massacred
and
eaten
the
children
confided
to
their
charge
i
have
seen
a
man
of
the
same
race
who
had
a
tail
an
inch
and
a
half
long
covered
with
a
few
hairs
he
appeared
to
be
years
old
he
was
robust
well
built
of
an
ebon
blackness
and
had
the
same
peculiar
formation
of
jaw
noticed
above
that
is
to
say
the
tooth
sockets
were
inclined
outwards
their
four
canine
teeth
are
filed
down
to
diminish
their
power
of
mastication
i
know
also
at
constantinople
the
son
of
a
physician
aged
two
years
who
was
born
with
a
tail
an
inch
long
he
belonged
to
the
white
caucasian
race
one
of
his
grandfathers
possessed
the
same
appendage
this
phenomenon
is
regarded
generally
in
the
east
as
a
sign
of
great
brute
force
about
ten
years
ago
a
newspaper
paragraph
recorded
the
birth
of
a
boy
at
provided
with
a
tail
about
an
inch
and
a
quarter
long
it
was
asserted
that
the
child
when
sucking
wagged
this
stump
as
token
of
pleasure
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
testimony
in
favor
of
tailed
men
and
women
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
impossibility
for
a
human
being
to
have
a
tail
for
the
spinal
vertebræ
in
man
do
not
admit
of
elongation
as
in
many
animals
for
the
spine
terminates
in
the
os
sacrum
a
large
and
expanded
bone
of
peculiar
character
entirely
precluding
all
possibility
of
production
to
the
spine
as
in
caudate
animals

from

ages
of
the

the
advent
of
the
man
of
sin
has
been
looked
forward
to
with
terror
and
the
passages
of
scripture
relating
to
him
have
been
studied
with
solemn
awe
lest
that
day
of
wrath
should
come
upon
the
church
unawares
as
events
in
the
history
took
place
which
seemed
to
be
indications
of
the
approach
of
antichrist
a
great
horror
fell
upon
men
minds
and
their
imaginations
conjured
up
myths
which
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
and
which
were
implicitly
believed
before
speaking
of
these
strange
tales
which
produced
such
an
effect
on
the
minds
of
men
in
the
middle
ages
it
will
be
well
briefly
to
examine
the
opinions
of
divines
of
the
early
ages
on
the
passages
of
scripture
connected
with
the
coming
of
the
last
great
persecutor
of
the
church
antichrist
was
believed
by
most
ancient
writers
to
be
destined
to
arise
out
of
the
tribe
of
dan
a
belief
founded
on
the
prediction
of
jacob
dan
shall
be
a
serpent
by
the
way
an
adder
in
the
path
conf
jeremiah
viii
and
on
the
exclamation
of
the
dying
patriarch
when
looking
on
his
son
dan
i
have
waited
for
thy
salvation
o
lord
as
though
the
of
god
had
borne
long
with
that
tribe
but
in
vain
and
it
was
to
be
extinguished
without
hope
this
indeed
is
implied
in
the
sealing
of
the
servants
of
god
in
their
foreheads
revelation
vii
when
twelve
thousand
out
of
every
tribe
except
dan
were
seen
by
john
to
receive
the
seal
of
adoption
whilst
of
the
tribe
of
dan
was
sealed
as
though
it
to
a
man
had
apostatized
opinions
as
to
the
nature
of
antichrist
were
divided
some
held
that
he
was
to
be
a
devil
in
phantom
body
and
of
this
number
was
hippolytus
others
again
believed
that
he
would
be
an
incarnate
demon
true
man
and
true
devil
in
fearful
and
diabolical
parody
of
the
incarnation
of
our
lord
a
third
view
was
that
he
would
be
merely
a
desperately
wicked
man
acting
upon
diabolical
inspirations
just
as
the
saints
act
upon
divine
inspirations
john
damascene
expressly
asserts
that
he
will
not
be
an
incarnate
demon
but
a
devilish
man
for
he
says
not
as
christ
assumed
humanity
so
will
the
devil
become
human
but
the
man
will
receive
all
the
inspiration
of
satan
and
will
suffer
the
devil
to
take
up
his
abode
within
him
in
this
manner
antichrist
could
have
many
forerunners
and
so
jerome
and
augustine
saw
an
antichrist
in
nero
not
antichrist
but
one
of
those
of
whom
the
apostle
speaks
even
now
are
there
many
antichrists
thus
also
every
enemy
of
the
faith
such
as
diocletian
julian
and
mahomet
has
been
regarded
as
a
precursor
of
the
who
was
expected
to
sum
up
in
himself
the
cruelty
of
a
nero
or
diocletian
the
show
of
virtue
of
a
julian
and
the
spiritual
pride
of
a
mahomet
from
infancy
the
evil
one
is
to
take
possession
of
antichrist
and
to
train
him
for
his
office
instilling
into
him
cunning
cruelty
and
pride
his
doctrine
will
be
not
downright
infidelity
but
a
show
of
godliness
whilst
denying
the
power
thereof
the
miraculous
origin
and
divine
authority
of
christianity
he
will
sow
doubts
of
our
lord
manifestation
in
the
flesh
he
will
allow
christ
to
be
an
excellent
man
capable
of
teaching
the
most
exalted
truths
and
inculcating
the
purest
morality
yet
himself
fallible
and
carried
away
by
fanaticism
in
the
end
however
antichrist
will
exalt
himself
to
sit
as
god
in
the
temple
of
god
and
become
the
abomination
of
desolation
standing
in
the
holy
place
at
the
same
time
there
is
to
be
an
awful
alliance
struck
between
himself
the
impersonification
of
the
and
the
church
of
god
some
high
pontiff
of
which
or
the
episcopacy
in
general
will
enter
into
league
with
the
unbelieving
state
to
oppress
the
very
elect
it
is
a
strange
instance
of
religionary
virulence
which
makes
some
detect
the
pope
of
rome
in
the
man
of
sin
the
harlot
the
beast
and
the
priest
going
before
it
the
man
of
sin
and
the
beast
are
unmistakably
identical
and
refer
to
an
antichristian
whilst
the
harlot
and
the
priest
are
symbols
of
an
apostasy
in
the
church
there
is
nothing
roman
in
this
but
something
very
much
the
opposite
how
the
abomination
of
desolation
can
be
considered
as
set
up
in
a
church
where
every
sanctuary
is
adorned
with
all
that
can
draw
the
heart
to
the
crucified
and
raise
the
thoughts
to
the
imposing
ritual
of
heaven
is
a
puzzle
to
me
to
the
man
uninitiated
in
the
law
that
revelation
is
to
be
interpreted
by
contraries
it
would
seem
more
like
the
abomination
of
desolation
in
the
holy
place
if
he
entered
a
scotch
presbyterian
or
a
dutch
calvinist
place
of
worship
rome
does
not
fight
against
the
daily
sacrifice
and
endeavor
to
abolish
it
that
has
been
rather
the
labor
of
church
reformers
who
with
the
suppression
of
the
doctrine
of
eucharistic
sacrifice
and
sacramental
adoration
have
well
nigh
obliterated
all
notion
of
worship
to
be
addressed
to
the
rome
does
not
deny
the
power
of
the
godliness
of
which
she
makes
show
but
insists
on
that
power
with
no
broken
accents
it
is
rather
in
other
communities
where
authority
is
flung
aside
and
any
man
is
permitted
to
believe
or
reject
what
he
likes
that
we
must
look
for
the
leaven
of
the
antichristian
spirit
at
work
it
is
evident
that
this
spirit
will
infect
the
church
and
especially
those
in
place
of
authority
therein
so
that
the
elect
will
have
to
wrestle
against
both
principalities
and
powers
in
the
state
and
also
spiritual
wickedness
in
the
high
places
of
the
church
perhaps
it
will
be
this
feeling
of
antagonism
between
the
inferior
orders
and
the
highest
which
will
throw
the
bishops
into
the
arms
of
the
state
and
establish
that
unholy
alliance
which
will
be
cemented
for
the
purpose
of
oppressing
all
who
hold
the
truth
in
sincerity
who
are
definite
in
their
dogmatic
statements
of
christ
having
been
manifested
in
the
flesh
who
labor
to
establish
the
daily
sacrifice
and
offer
in
every
place
the
pure
offering
spoken
of
by
malachi
perhaps
it
was
in
anticipation
of
this
that
ancient
mystical
interpreters
explained
the
scene
at
the
well
in
midian
as
having
reference
to
the
last
times
the
church
like
the
daughters
of
reuel
comes
to
the
well
of
living
waters
to
water
her
parched
flock
whereupon
the
shepherds
her
chief
pastors
arise
and
strive
with
her
fear
not
o
flock
fear
not
o
daughter
exclaims
the
commentator
thy
true
moses
is
seated
on
the
well
and
he
will
arise
out
of
his
and
will
with
his
own
hand
smite
the
shepherds
and
water
the
flock
let
the
sheep
be
in
barren
and
dry
pastures
so
long
the
shepherds
strive
not
let
the
sheep
pant
and
die
so
long
the
shepherds
show
no
signs
of
irritation
but
let
the
church
approach
the
limpid
well
of
life
and
at
once
her
prelates
will
in
the
latter
days
combine
to
strive
with
her
and
keep
back
the
flock
from
the
reviving
streams
in
the
time
of
antichrist
the
church
will
be
divided
one
portion
will
hold
to
the
the
other
will
seek
out
the
old
paths
and
cling
to
the
only
true
guide
the
high
places
will
be
filled
with
unbelievers
in
the
incarnation
and
the
church
will
be
in
a
condition
of
the
utmost
spiritual
degradation
but
enjoying
the
highest
state
patronage
the
religion
in
favor
will
be
one
of
morality
but
not
of
dogma
and
the
man
of
sin
will
be
able
to
promulgate
his
doctrine
according
to
anselm
through
his
great
eloquence
and
wisdom
his
vast
learning
and
mightiness
in
the
holy
scriptures
which
he
will
wrest
to
the
overthrowing
of
dogma
he
will
be
liberal
in
bribes
for
he
will
be
of
unbounded
wealth
he
will
be
capable
of
performing
great
signs
and
wonders
so
as
to
deceive
the
very
elect
and
at
the
last
he
will
tear
the
moral
veil
from
his
countenance
and
a
monster
of
impiety
and
cruelty
he
will
inaugurate
that
awful
persecution
which
is
to
last
for
three
years
and
a
half
and
to
excel
in
horror
all
the
persecutions
that
have
gone
before
in
that
terrible
season
of
confusion
faith
will
be
all
but
extinguished
when
the
son
of
man
cometh
shall
he
find
faith
on
the
earth
asks
our
blessed
lord
as
though
expecting
the
answer
no
and
then
says
marchantius
the
vessel
of
the
church
will
disappear
in
the
foam
of
that
boiling
deep
of
infidelity
and
be
hidden
in
the
blackness
of
that
storm
of
destruction
which
sweeps
over
the
earth
the
sun
shall
be
darkened
and
the
moon
shall
not
give
her
light
and
the
stars
shall
fall
from
heaven
the
sun
of
faith
shall
have
gone
out
the
moon
the
church
shall
not
give
her
light
being
turned
into
blood
through
stress
of
persecution
and
the
stars
the
great
ecclesiastical
dignitaries
shall
fall
into
apostasy
but
still
the
church
will
remain
unwrecked
she
will
weather
the
storm
still
will
she
come
forth
beautiful
as
the
moon
terrible
as
an
army
with
banners
for
after
the
lapse
of
those
three
and
a
half
years
christ
will
descend
to
avenge
the
blood
of
the
saints
by
destroying
antichrist
and
the
such
is
a
brief
sketch
of
the
scriptural
doctrine
of
antichrist
as
held
by
the
early
and
mediæval
church
let
us
now
see
to
what
myths
it
gave
rise
among
the
vulgar
and
the
imaginative
rabanus
maurus
in
his
work
on
the
life
of
antichrist
gives
a
full
account
of
the
miracles
he
will
perform
he
tells
us
that
the
will
heal
the
sick
raise
the
dead
restore
sight
to
the
blind
hearing
to
the
deaf
speech
to
the
dumb
he
will
raise
storms
and
calm
them
will
remove
mountains
make
trees
flourish
or
wither
at
a
word
he
will
rebuild
the
temple
at
jerusalem
and
making
the
holy
city
the
great
capital
of
the
world
popular
opinion
added
that
his
vast
wealth
would
be
obtained
from
hidden
treasures
which
are
now
being
concealed
by
the
demons
for
his
use
various
possessed
persons
when
interrogated
announced
that
such
was
the
case
and
that
the
amount
of
buried
gold
was
vast
in
the
year
says
canon
moreau
a
contemporary
historian
a
rumor
circulated
with
prodigious
rapidity
through
europe
that
antichrist
had
been
born
at
babylon
and
that
already
the
jews
of
that
part
were
hurrying
to
receive
and
recognize
him
as
their
messiah
the
news
came
from
italy
and
germany
and
extended
to
spain
england
and
other
western
kingdoms
troubling
many
people
even
the
most
discreet
however
the
learned
gave
it
no
credence
saying
that
the
signs
predicted
in
scripture
to
precede
that
event
were
not
yet
accomplished
and
among
other
that
the
roman
empire
was
not
yet
abolished
others
said
that
as
for
the
signs
the
majority
had
already
appeared
to
the
best
of
their
knowledge
and
with
regard
to
the
rest
they
might
have
taken
place
in
distant
regions
without
their
having
been
made
known
to
them
that
the
roman
empire
existed
but
in
name
and
that
the
interpretation
of
the
passage
on
which
its
destruction
was
predicted
might
be
incorrect
that
for
many
centuries
the
most
learned
and
pious
had
believed
in
the
near
approach
of
antichrist
some
believing
that
he
had
already
come
on
account
of
the
persecutions
which
had
fallen
on
the
christians
others
on
account
of
fires
or
eclipses
or
earthquakes
every
one
was
in
excitement
some
declared
that
the
news
must
be
correct
others
believed
nothing
about
it
and
the
agitation
became
so
excessive
that
henry
who
was
then
on
the
throne
was
compelled
by
edict
to
forbid
any
mention
of
the
subject
the
report
spoken
of
by
moreau
gained
additional
confirmation
from
the
announcement
made
by
an
exorcised
demoniac
that
in
the
man
of
sin
had
been
born
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
of
a
jewess
named
blanchefleure
who
had
conceived
by
satan
the
child
had
been
baptized
at
the
sabbath
of
sorcerers
and
a
witch
under
torture
acknowledged
that
she
had
rocked
the
infant
antichrist
on
her
knees
and
she
averred
that
he
had
claws
on
his
feet
wore
no
shoes
and
spoke
all
languages
in
appeared
the
following
startling
announcement
which
obtained
an
immense
circulation
among
the
lower
orders
we
brothers
of
the
order
of
john
of
jerusalem
in
the
isle
of
malta
have
received
letters
from
our
spies
who
are
engaged
in
our
service
in
the
country
of
babylon
now
possessed
by
the
grand
turk
by
the
which
letters
we
are
advertised
that
on
the
of
may
in
the
year
of
our
lord
a
child
was
born
in
the
town
of
bourydot
otherwise
called
calka
near
babylon
of
the
which
child
the
mother
is
a
very
aged
woman
of
race
unknown
called
of
the
father
nothing
is
known
the
child
is
dusky
has
pleasant
mouth
and
eyes
teeth
pointed
like
those
of
a
cat
ears
large
stature
by
no
means
exceeding
that
of
other
children
the
said
child
incontinent
on
his
birth
walked
and
talked
perfectly
well
his
speech
is
comprehended
by
every
one
admonishing
the
people
that
he
is
the
true
messiah
and
the
son
of
god
and
that
in
him
all
must
believe
our
spies
also
swear
and
protest
that
they
have
seen
the
said
child
with
their
own
eyes
and
they
add
that
on
the
occasion
of
his
nativity
there
appeared
marvellous
signs
in
heaven
for
at
full
noon
the
sun
lost
its
brightness
and
was
for
some
time
obscured
this
is
followed
by
a
list
of
other
signs
appearing
the
most
remarkable
being
a
swarm
of
flying
serpents
and
a
shower
of
precious
stones
according
to
sebastian
michaeliz
in
his
history
of
the
possessed
of
flanders
on
the
authority
of
the
exorcised
demons
we
learn
that
antichrist
is
to
be
a
son
of
beelzebub
who
will
accompany
his
offspring
under
the
form
of
a
bird
with
four
feet
and
a
bull
head
that
he
will
torture
christians
with
the
same
tortures
with
which
the
lost
souls
are
racked
that
he
will
be
able
to
fly
speak
all
languages
and
will
have
any
number
of
names
we
find
that
antichrist
is
known
to
the
mussulmans
as
well
as
to
christians
lane
in
his
edition
of
the
arabian
nights
gives
some
curious
details
on
moslem
ideas
regarding
him
according
to
these
antichrist
will
overrun
the
earth
mounted
on
an
ass
and
followed
by
jews
his
empire
will
last
forty
days
whereof
the
first
day
will
be
a
year
long
the
duration
of
the
second
will
be
a
month
that
of
the
third
a
week
the
others
being
of
their
usual
length
he
will
devastate
the
whole
world
leaving
mecca
and
medina
alone
in
security
as
these
holy
cities
will
be
guarded
by
angelic
legions
christ
at
last
will
descend
to
earth
and
in
a
great
battle
will
destroy
the
several
writers
of
different
denominations
no
less
superstitious
than
the
common
people
connected
the
apparition
of
antichrist
with
the
fable
of
pope
joan
which
obtained
such
general
credence
at
one
time
but
which
modern
criticism
has
at
length
succeeded
in
excluding
from
history
perhaps
the
earliest
writer
to
mention
pope
joan
is
marianus
scotus
who
in
his
chronicle
inserts
the
following
passage
lotharii
joanna
a
woman
succeeded
leo
and
reigned
two
years
five
months
and
four
days
marianus
scotus
died
sigebert
de
gemblours
inserts
the
same
story
in
his
valuable
chronicle
copying
from
an
interpolated
passage
in
the
work
of
anastasius
the
librarian
his
words
are
it
is
reported
that
this
john
was
a
female
and
that
she
conceived
by
one
of
her
servants
the
pope
becoming
pregnant
gave
birth
to
a
child
wherefore
some
do
not
number
her
among
the
pontiffs
hence
the
story
spread
among
the
mediæval
chroniclers
who
were
great
plagiarists
otto
of
frisingen
and
gotfrid
of
viterbo
mention
the
in
their
histories
and
martin
polonus
gives
details
as
follows
after
leo
john
anglus
a
native
of
metz
reigned
two
years
five
months
and
four
days
and
the
pontificate
was
vacant
for
a
month
he
died
in
rome
he
is
related
to
have
been
a
female
and
when
a
girl
to
have
accompanied
her
sweetheart
in
male
costume
to
athens
there
she
advanced
in
various
sciences
and
none
could
be
found
to
equal
her
so
after
having
studied
for
three
years
in
rome
she
had
great
masters
for
her
pupils
and
hearers
and
when
there
arose
a
high
opinion
in
the
city
of
her
virtue
and
knowledge
she
was
unanimously
elected
pope
but
during
her
papacy
she
became
in
the
family
way
by
a
familiar
not
knowing
the
time
of
birth
as
she
was
on
her
way
from
peter
to
the
lateran
she
had
a
painful
delivery
between
the
coliseum
and
church
in
the
street
having
died
after
it
is
said
that
she
was
buried
on
the
spot
and
therefore
the
lord
pope
always
turns
aside
from
that
way
and
it
is
supposed
by
some
out
of
detestation
for
what
happened
there
nor
on
that
account
is
she
placed
in
the
catalogue
of
the
holy
pontiffs
not
only
on
account
of
her
sex
but
also
because
of
the
horribleness
of
the
circumstance
certainly
a
story
at
all
scandalous
william
ocham
alludes
to
the
story
and
john
huss
only
too
happy
to
believe
it
provides
the
lady
with
a
name
and
asserts
that
she
was
baptized
agnes
or
as
he
will
have
it
with
a
strong
aspirate
hagnes
others
however
insist
upon
her
name
having
been
gilberta
and
some
stout
germans
not
relishing
the
notion
of
her
being
a
daughter
of
fatherland
palm
her
off
on
england
as
soon
as
we
arrive
at
reformation
times
the
german
and
french
protestants
fasten
on
the
story
with
the
utmost
avidity
and
add
sweet
little
touches
of
their
own
and
draw
conclusions
galling
enough
to
the
roman
see
illustrating
their
accounts
with
wood
engravings
vigorous
and
graphic
but
hardly
decent
one
of
these
represents
the
event
in
a
peculiarly
startling
manner
the
procession
of
bishops
with
the
host
and
tapers
is
sweeping
along
when
suddenly
the
before
the
and
vested
pope
starts
aside
to
witness
the
unexpected
arrival
this
engraving
which
it
is
quite
impossible
for
me
to
reproduce
is
in
a
curious
little
book
entitled
puerperium
johannis
papæ
the
following
jingling
record
of
the
event
is
from
the
rhythmical
vitæ

of
gulielmus
jacobus
of
egmonden

stephen
blanch
in
his
urbis
romæ
mirabilia
says
that
an
angel
of
heaven
appeared
to
joan
before
the
event
and
asked
her
to
choose
whether
she
would
prefer
burning
eternally
in
hell
or
having
her
confinement
in
public
with
sense
which
does
her
credit
she
chose
the
latter
the
protestant
writers
were
not
satisfied
that
the
father
of
the
unhappy
baby
should
have
been
a
servant
some
made
him
a
cardinal
and
others
the
devil
himself
according
to
an
eminent
dutch
minister
it
is
immaterial
whether
the
child
be
fathered
on
satan
or
a
monk
at
all
events
the
former
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
youthful
antichrist
and
on
the
occasion
of
his
birth
was
seen
and
heard
fluttering
overhead
crowing
and
chanting
in
an
unmusical
voice
the
sibylline
verses
announcing
the
birth
of
the
papa
pater
patrum
papissæ
pandito
partum
et

de

quando

which
lines
as
being
perhaps
the
only
ones
known
to
be
of
diabolic
composition
are
deserving
of
preservation
the
reformers
in
order
to
reconcile
dates
were
put
to
the
somewhat
perplexing
necessity
of
moving
pope
joan
to
their
own
times
or
else
of
giving
to
the
youthful
antichrist
an
age
of
seven
hundred
years
it
must
be
allowed
that
the
of
a
pope
in
full
pontificals
during
a
solemn
procession
was
a
prodigy
not
likely
to
occur
more
than
once
in
the
world
history
and
was
certain
to
be
of
momentous
import
it
will
be
seen
by
the
curious
woodcut
reproduced
as
frontispiece
from
baptista
mantuanus
that
he
consigned
pope
joan
to
the
jaws
of
hell
notwithstanding
her
choice
the
verses
accompanying
this
picture
are
hic
pendebat
adhuc
sexum
mentita
virile
fœmina
cui
triplici
phrygiam
diademate
mitram
extollebat
apex
et
pontificalis
adulter
it
need
hardly
be
stated
that
the
whole
story
of
pope
joan
is
fabulous
and
rests
on
not
the
slightest
historical
foundation
it
was
probably
a
greek
invention
to
throw
discredit
on
the
papal
hierarchy
first
circulated
more
than
two
hundred
years
after
the
date
of
the
supposed
pope
even
martin
polonus
who
is
the
first
to
give
the
details
does
so
merely
on
popular
report
the
great
champions
of
the
myth
were
the
protestants
of
the
sixteenth
century
who
were
thoroughly
unscrupulous
in
distorting
history
and
suppressing
facts
so
long
as
they
could
make
a
point
a
paper
war
was
waged
upon
the
subject
and
finally
the
whole
story
was
proved
conclusively
to
be
utterly
destitute
of
historical
truth
a
melancholy
example
of
the
blindness
of
party
feeling
and
prejudice
is
seen
in
mosheim
who
assumes
the
truth
of
the
ridiculous
story
and
gravely
inserts
it
in
his
ecclesiastical
history
between
leo
who
died
and
benedict
a
woman
who
concealed
her
sex
and
assumed
the
name
of
john
it
is
said
opened
her
way
to
the
pontifical
throne
by
her
learning
and
genius
and
governed
the
church
for
a
time
she
is
commonly
called
the
papess
joan
during
the
five
subsequent
centuries
the
witnesses
to
this
extraordinary
event
are
without
number
nor
did
any
one
prior
to
the
reformation
by
luther
regard
the
thing
as
either
incredible
or
disgraceful
to
the
church
such
are
words
and
i
give
them
as
a
specimen
of
the
credit
which
is
due
to
his
opinion
the
ecclesiastical
history
he
wrote
is
full
of
perversions
of
the
plainest
facts
and
that
under
our
notice
is
but
one
out
of
many
during
the
five
centuries
after
her
reign
he
says
the
witnesses
to
the
story
are
innumerable
now
for
two
centuries
there
is
not
an
allusion
to
be
found
to
the
events
the
only
passage
which
can
be
found
is
a
universally
acknowledged
interpolation
of
the
lives
of
the
popes
by
anastasius
bibliothecarius
and
this
interpolation
is
stated
in
the
first
printed
edition
by
busæus
mogunt
to
be
only
found
in
two
copies
from
marianus
scotus
or
sigebert
de
gemblours
the
story
passed
into
other
chronicles
and
generally
with
hesitation
and
an
expression
of
doubt
in
its
accuracy
martin
polonus
is
the
first
to
give
the
particulars
some
four
hundred
and
twenty
years
after
the
reign
of
the
fabulous
pope
mosheim
is
false
again
in
asserting
that
no
one
prior
to
the
reformation
regarded
the
thing
as
either
incredible
or
disgraceful
this
is
but
of
a
piece
with
his
malignity
and
disregard
for
truth
whenever
he
can
hit
the
catholic
church
hard
bart
platina
in
his
lives
of
the
popes
written
before
luther
was
born
after
relating
the
story
says
these
things
which
i
relate
are
popular
reports
but
derived
from
uncertain
and
obscure
authors
which
i
have
therefore
inserted
briefly
and
baldly
lest
i
should
seem
to
omit
obstinately
and
pertinaciously
what
most
people
assert
thus
the
facts
were
justly
doubted
by
platina
on
the
legitimate
grounds
that
they
rested
on
popular
gossip
and
not
on
reliable
history
marianus
scotus
the
first
to
relate
the
story
died
in
he
was
a
monk
of
martin
of
cologne
then
of
fulda
and
lastly
of
alban
at
metz
how
could
he
have
obtained
reliable
information
or
seen
documents
upon
which
to
ground
the
assertion
again
his
chronicle
has
suffered
severely
from
interpolations
in
numerous
places
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
passage
is
itself
a
late
interpolation
if
so
we
are
reduced
to
sigebert
de
gemblours
placing
two
centuries
and
a
half
between
him
and
the
event
he
records
and
his
chronicle
may
have
been
tampered
with
the
historical
discrepancies
are
sufficiently
glaring
to
make
the
story
more
than
questionable
leo
iv
died
on
the
july
and
benedict
iii
was
consecrated
on
the
september
in
the
same
year
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
insert
between
their
pontificates
a
reign
of
two
years
five
months
and
four
days
it
is
however
true
that
there
was
an
antipope
elected
upon
the
death
of
leo
at
the
instance
of
the
emperor
louis
but
his
name
was
anastasius
this
man
possessed
himself
of
the
palace
of
the
popes
and
obtained
the
incarceration
of
benedict
however
his
supporters
almost
immediately
deserted
him
and
benedict
assumed
the
pontificate
the
reign
of
benedict
was
only
for
two
years
and
a
half
so
that
anastasius
can
not
be
the
supposed
joan
nor
do
we
hear
of
any
charge
brought
against
him
to
the
effect
of
his
being
a
woman
but
the
stout
partisans
of
the
tale
assert
on
the
authority
of
the
annales
augustani
and
some
other
but
late
authorities
that
the
female
pope
was
john
who
consecrated
louis
ii
of
france
and
ethelwolf
of
england
here
again
is
confusion
ethelwolf
sent
alfred
to
rome
in
and
the
youth
received
regal
unction
from
the
hands
of
leo
iv
in
ethelwolf
visited
rome
it
is
true
but
was
not
consecrated
by
the
existing
pope
whilst
charles
the
bald
was
anointed
by
john

in

son
of

one

story

controversialists
may

joan
was
the
daughter
of
an
english
missionary
who
left
england
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
recently
converted
saxons
she
was
born
at
engelheim
and
according
to
different
authors
she
was
christened
agnes
gerberta
joanna
margaret
isabel
dorothy
or
jutt
the
last
must
have
been
a
nickname
surely
she
early
distinguished
herself
for
genius
and
love
of
letters
a
young
monk
of
fulda
having
conceived
for
her
a
violent
passion
which
she
returned
with
ardor
she
deserted
her
parents
dressed
herself
in
male
attire
and
in
the
sacred
precincts
of
fulda
divided
her
affections
between
the
youthful
monk
and
the
musty
books
of
the
monastic
library
not
satisfied
with
the
restraints
of
conventual
life
nor
finding
the
library
sufficiently
well
provided
with
books
of
abstruse
science
she
eloped
with
her
young
man
and
after
visiting
england
france
and
italy
she
brought
him
to
athens
where
she
addicted
herself
with
unflagging
devotion
to
her
literary
pursuits
wearied
out
by
his
journey
the
monk
expired
in
the
arms
of
the
who
had
influenced
his
life
for
evil
and
the
young
lady
of
so
many
aliases
was
for
a
while
inconsolable
she
left
athens
and
repaired
to
rome
there
she
opened
a
school
and
acquired
such
a
reputation
for
learning
and
feigned
sanctity
that
on
the
death
of
leo
she
was
unanimously
elected
pope
for
two
years
and
five
months
under
the
name
of
john
she
filled
the
papal
chair
with
reputation
no
one
suspecting
her
sex
but
having
taken
a
fancy
to
one
of
the
cardinals
by
him
she
became
pregnant
at
length
arrived
the
time
of
rogation
processions
whilst
passing
the
street
between
the
amphitheatre
and
clement
she
was
seized
with
violent
pains
fell
to
the
ground
amidst
the
crowd
and
whilst
her
attendants
ministered
to
her
was
delivered
of
a
son
some
say
the
child
and
mother
died
on
the
spot
some
that
she
survived
but
was
incarcerated
some
that
the
child
was
spirited
away
to
be
the
antichrist
of
the
last
days
a
marble
monument
representing
the
papess
with
her
baby
was
erected
on
the
spot
which
was
declared
to
be
accursed
to
all
ages
i
have
little
doubt
myself
that
pope
joan
is
an
impersonification
of
the
great
whore
of
revelation
seated
on
the
seven
hills
and
is
the
popular
expression
of
the
idea
prevalent
from
the
twelfth
to
the
sixteenth
centuries
that
the
mystery
of
iniquity
was
somehow
working
in
the
papal
court
the
scandal
of
the
antipopes
the
utter
worldliness
and
pride
of
others
the
spiritual
fornication
with
the
kings
of
the
earth
along
with
the
words
of
revelation
prophesying
the
advent
of
an
adulterous
woman
who
should
rule
over
the
imperial
city
and
her
connection
with
antichrist
crystallized
into
this
curious
myth
much
as
the
floating
uncertainty
as
to
the
signification
of
our
lord
words
there
be
some
standing
here
which
shall
not

footnote
these
annals
were
written
in
the
man
in
the
moon
illustration
from
l
richter
every
one
knows
that
the
moon
is
inhabited
by
a
man
with
a
bundle
of
sticks
on
his
back
who
has
been
exiled
thither
for
many
centuries
and
who
is
so
far
off
that
he
is
beyond
the
reach
of
death
he
has
once
visited
this
earth
if
the
nursery
rhyme
is
to
be
credited
when
it
asserts
that
the
man
in
the
moon
came
down
too
soon
and
asked
his
way
to
norwich
but
whether
he
ever
reached
that
city
the
same
authority
does
not
state
the
story
as
told
by
nurses
is
that
this
man
was
found
by
moses
gathering
sticks
on
a
sabbath
and
that
for
this
crime
he
was
doomed
to
reside
in
the
moon
till
the
end
of
all
things
and
they
refer
to
numbers
xv
and
while
the
children
of
israel
were
in
the
wilderness
they
found
a
man
that
gathered
sticks
upon
the
sabbath
day
and
they
that
found
him
gathering
sticks
brought
him
unto
moses
and
aaron
and
unto
all
the
congregation
and
they
put
him
in
ward
because
it
was
not
declared
what
should
be
done
to
him
and
the
lord
said
unto
moses
the
man
shall
be
surely
put
to
death
all
the
congregation
shall
stone
him
with
stones
without
the
camp
and
all
the
congregation
brought
him
without
the
camp
and
stoned
him
with
stones
till
he
died
of
course
in
the
sacred
writings
there
is
no
allusion
to
the
moon
the
german
tale
is
as
follows
ages
ago
there
went
one
sunday
morning
an
old
man
into
the
wood
to
hew
sticks
he
cut
a
fagot
and
slung
it
on
a
stout
staff
cast
it
over
his
shoulder
and
began
to
trudge
home
with
his
burden
on
his
way
he
met
a
handsome
man
in
sunday
suit
walking
towards
the
church
this
man
stopped
and
asked
the
do
you
know
that
this
is
sunday
on
earth
when
all
must
rest
from
their
labors
sunday
on
earth
or
monday
in
heaven
it
is
all
one
to
me
laughed
the
then
bear
your
bundle
forever
answered
the
stranger
and
as
you
value
not
sunday
on
earth
yours
shall
be
a
perpetual
in
heaven
and
you
shall
stand
for
eternity
in
the
moon
a
warning
to
all
thereupon
the
stranger
vanished
and
the
man
was
caught
up
with
his
stock
and
his
fagot
into
the
moon
where
he
stands
yet
the
superstition
seems
to
be
old
in
germany
for
the
full
moon
is
spoken
of

that

a
primeval
superstition
of
the
aryan
race
there
is
an
ancient
pictorial
representation
of
our
friend
the
in
gyffyn
church
near
conway
the
roof
of
the
chancel
is
divided
into
compartments
in
four
of
which
are
the
evangelistic
symbols
rudely
yet
effectively
painted
besides
these
symbols
is
delineated
in
each
compartment
an
orb
of
heaven
the
sun
the
moon
and
two
stars
are
placed
at
the
feet
of
the
angel
the
bull
the
lion
and
the
eagle
the
representation
of
the
moon
is
as
below
in
the
disk
is
the
conventional
man
with
his
bundle
of
sticks
but
without
the
dog
there
is
also
a
curious
seal
appended
to
a
deed
preserved
in
the
record
office
dated
the
year
of
edward
the
third
bearing
the
man
in
the
moon
as
its
device
the
deed
is
one
of
conveyance
of
a
messuage
barn
and
four
acres
of
ground
in
the
parish
of
from
walter
de
grendesse
clerk
to
margaret
his
mother
on
the
seal
we
see
the
man
carrying
his
sticks
and
the
moon
surrounds
him
there
are
also
a
couple
of
stars
added
perhaps
to
show
that
he
is
in
the
sky
the
legend
on
the
seal
reads
te

which
may
be
translated
i
will
teach

illustration
the
seal
with
the
legend
visible
the
general
superstition
with
regard
to
the
spots
in
the
moon
may
briefly
be
summed
up
thus
a
man
is
located
in
the
moon
he
is
a
thief
or
he
has
a
pole
over
his
shoulder
from
which
is
suspended
a
bundle
of
sticks
or
thorns
in
some
places
a
woman
is
believed
to
accompany
him
and
she
has
a
with
her
in
other
localities
she
is
replaced
by
a
dog
the
belief
in
the
seems
to
exist
among
the
natives
of
british
columbia
for
i
read
in
one
of
duncan
letters
to
the
church
missionary
society
one
very
dark
night
i
was
told
that
there
was
a
moon
to
see
on
the
beach
on
going
to
see
there
was
an
illuminated
disk
with
the
figure
of
a
man
upon
it
the
water
was
then
very
low
and
one
of
the
conjuring
parties
had
lit
up
this
disk
at
the
edge
they
had
made
it
of
wax
with
great
exactness
and
presently
it
was
at
full
it
was
an
imposing
sight
nothing
could
be
seen
around
it
but
the
indians
suppose
that
the
medicine
party
are
then
holding
converse
with
the
man
in
the
moon
after
a
short
time
the
moon
waned
away
and
the
conjuring
party
returned
whooping
to
their
house
now
let
us
turn
to
scandinavian
mythology
and
see
what
we
learn
from
that
source
mâni
the
moon
stole
two
children
from
their
parents
and
carried
them
up
to
heaven
their
names
were
hjuki
and
bil
they
had
been
drawing
water
from
the
well
byrgir
in
the
bucket
sœgr
suspended
from
the
pole
simul
which
they
bore
upon
their
shoulders
these
children
pole
and
bucket
were
placed
in
heaven
where
they
could
be
seen
from
earth
this
refers
undoubtedly
to
the
spots
in
the
moon
and
so
the
swedish
peasantry
explain
these
spots
to
this
day
as
representing
a
boy
and
a
girl
bearing
a
pail
of
water
between
them
are
we
not
reminded
at
once
of
our
nursery
rhyme
jack
and
jill
went
up
a
hill
to
fetch
a
pail
of
water
jack
fell
down
and
broke
his
crown
and
jill
came
tumbling
after
this
verse
which
to
us
seems
at
first
sight
nonsense
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
has
a
high
antiquity
and
refers
to
the
eddaic
hjuki
and
bil
the
names
indicate
as
much
hjuki
in
norse
would
be
pronounced
juki
which
would
readily
become
jack
and
bil
for
the
sake
of
euphony
and
in
order
to
give
a
female
name
to
one
of
the
children
would
become
jill
the
fall
of
jack
and
the
subsequent
fall
of
jill
simply
represent
the
vanishing
of
one
after
another
as
the
moon
wanes
but
the
old
norse
myth
had
a
deeper
signification
than
merely
an
explanation
of
the
hjuki
is
derived
from
the
verb
jakka
to
heap
or
pile
together
to
assemble
and
increase
and
bil
from
bila
to
break
up
or
dissolve
hjuki
and
bil
therefore
signify
nothing
more
than
the
waxing
and
waning
of
the
moon
and
the
water
they
are
represented
as
bearing
signifies
the
fact
that
the
rainfall
depends
on
the
phases
of
the
moon
waxing
and
waning
were
individualized
and
the
meteorological
fact
of
the
connection
of
the
rain
with
the
moon
was
represented
by
the
children
as
but
though
jack
and
jill
became
by
degrees
dissevered
in
the
popular
mind
from
the
moon
the
original
myth
went
through
a
fresh
phase
and
exists
still
under
a
new
form
the
norse
superstition
attributed
to
the
moon
and
the
vulgar
soon
began
to
believe
that
the
figure
they
saw
in
the
moon
was
the
thief
the
lunar
specks
certainly
may
be
made
to
resemble
one
figure
and
only
a
lively
imagination
can
discern
two
the
girl
soon
dropped
out
of
popular
mythology
the
boy
oldened
into
a
venerable
man
he
retained
his
pole
and
the
bucket
was
transformed
into
the
thing
he
had
stolen
sticks
or
vegetables
the
theft
was
in
some
places
exchanged
for
especially
among
those
in
protestant
countries
who
were
acquainted
with
the
bible
story
of
the
the
indian
superstition
is
worth
examining
because
of
the
connection
existing
between
indian
and
european
mythology
on
account
of
our
belonging
to
the
same
aryan
stock
according
to
a
buddhist
legend
sâkyamunni
himself
in
one
of
his
earlier
stages
of
existence
was
a
hare
and
lived
in
friendship
with
a
fox
and
an
ape
in
order
to
test
the
virtue
of
the
bodhisattwa
indra
came
to
the
friends
in
the
form
of
an
old
man
asking
for
food
hare
ape
and
fox
went
forth
in
quest
of
victuals
for
their
guest
the
two
latter
returned
from
their
foraging
expedition
successful
but
the
hare
had
found
nothing
then
rather
than
that
he
should
treat
the
old
man
with
inhospitality
the
hare
had
a
fire
kindled
and
cast
himself
into
the
flames
that
he
might
himself
become
food
for
his
guest
in
reward
for
this
act
of
indra
carried
the
hare
to
heaven
and
placed
him
in
the
moon
here
we
have
an
old
man
and
a
hare
in
connection
with
the
lunar
planet
just
as
in
shakspeare
we
have
a
and
a
dog
the
fable
rests
upon
the
name
of
the
moon
in
sanskrit
çaçin
or
that
marked
with
the
hare
but
whether
the
belief
in
the
spots
taking
the
shape
of
a
hare
gave
the
name
çaçin
to
the
moon
or
the
lunar
name
çaçin
originated
the
belief
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
say
grounded
upon
this
myth
is
the
curious
story
of
the
hare
and
the
elephant
in
the
pantschatantra
an
ancient
collection
of
sanskrit
fables
it
will
be
found
as
the
first
tale
in
the
third
book
i
have
room
only
for
an
outline
of
the
story
the
crafty
hare
in
a
certain
forest
lived
a
mighty
elephant
king
of
a
herd
toothy
by
name
on
a
certain
occasion
there
was
a
long
drought
so
that
pools
tanks
swamps
and
lakes
were
dried
up
then
the
elephants
sent
out
exploring
parties
in
search
of
water
a
young
one
discovered
an
extensive
lake
surrounded
with
trees
and
teeming
with
it
went
by
the
name
of
the
the
elephants
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
having
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
water
marched
off
to
the
spot
and
found
their
most
sanguine
hopes
realized
round
about
the
lake
in
the
sandy
soil
were
innumerable
hare
warrens
and
as
the
herd
of
elephants
trampled
on
the
ground
the
hares
were
severely
injured
their
homes
broken
down
their
heads
legs
and
backs
crushed
beneath
the
ponderous
feet
of
the
monsters
of
the
forest
as
soon
as
the
herd
had
withdrawn
the
hares
assembled
some
halting
some
dripping
with
blood
some
bearing
the
corpses
of
their
cherished
infants
some
with
piteous
tales
of
ruination
in
their
houses
all
with
tears
streaming
from
their
eyes
and
wailing
forth
alas
we
are
lost
the
will
return
for
there
is
no
water
elsewhere
and
that
will
be
the
death
of
all
of
us
but
the
wise
and
prudent
longear
volunteered
to
drive
the
herd
away
and
he
succeeded
in
this
manner
longear
went
to
the
elephants
and
having
singled
out
their
king
he
addressed
him
as
follows
ha
ha
bad
elephant
what
brings
you
with
such
thoughtless
frivolity
to
this
strange
lake
back
with
you
at
once
when
the
king
of
the
elephants
heard
this
he
asked
in
astonishment
pray
who
are
you
i
replied
longear
i
am
vidschajadatta
by
name
the
hare
who
resides
in
the
moon
now
am
i
sent
by
his
excellency
the
moon
as
an
ambassador
to
you
i
speak
to
you
in
the
name
of
the
moon
ahem
hare
said
the
elephant
somewhat
staggered
and
what
message
have
you
brought
me
from
his
excellency
the
moon
you
have
this
day
injured
several
hares
are
you
not
aware
that
they
are
the
subjects
of
me
if
you
value
your
life
venture
not
near
the
lake
again
break
my
command
and
i
shall
withdraw
my
beams
from
you
at
night
and
your
bodies
will
be
consumed
with
perpetual
sun
the
elephant
after
a
short
meditation
said
friend
it
is
true
that
i
have
acted
against
the
rights
of
the
excellent
majesty
of
the
moon
i
should
wish
to
make
an
apology
how
can
i
do
so
the
hare
replied
come
along
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
the
elephant
asked
where
is
his
excellency
at
present
the
other
replied
he
is
now
in
the
lake
hearing
the
complaints
of
the
maimed
hares
if
that
be
the
case
said
the
elephant
humbly
bring
me
to
my
lord
that
i
may
tender
him
my
submission
so
the
hare
conducted
the
king
of
the
elephants
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
showed
him
the
reflection
of
the
moon
in
the
water
saying
there
stands
our
lord
in
the
midst
of
the
water
plunged
in
meditation
reverence
him
with
devotion
and
then
depart
with
speed
thereupon
the
elephant
poked
his
proboscis
into
the
water
and
muttered
a
fervent
prayer
by
so
doing
he
set
the
water
in
agitation
so
that
the
reflection
of
the
moon
was
all
of
a
quiver
look
exclaimed
the
hare
his
majesty
is
trembling
with
rage
at
you
why
is
his
supreme
excellency
enraged
with
me
asked
the
elephant
because
you
have
set
the
water
in
motion
worship
him
and
then
be
off
the
elephant
let
his
ears
droop
bowed
his
great
head
to
the
earth
and
after
having
expressed
in
suitable
terms
his
regret
for
having
annoyed
the
moon
and
the
hare
dwelling
in
it
he
vowed
never
to
trouble
the
again
then
he
departed
and
the
hares
have
ever
since
lived
there

ragged

rises
the

out
of
the
rich
and
populous
land
between
eisenach
and

looking
from

distance
like
a
huge

sarcophagus
a

in

a
mysterious
world
of
wonders
high
up
on
the
flank
of
the
mountain
in
a
precipitous
wall
of
rock
opens
a
cavern
called
the
hörselloch
from
the
depths
of
which
issues
a
muffled
roar
of
water
as
though
a
subterraneous
stream
were
rushing
over
millwheels
when
i
have
stood
alone
on
the
ridge
of
the
mountain
says
bechstein
after
having
sought
the
chasm
in
vain
i
have
heard
a
mighty
rush
like
that
of
falling
water
beneath
my
feet
and
after
scrambling
down
the
scarp
have
found
myself
how
i
never
knew
in
front
of
the
cave
sagenschatz
des
in
ancient
days
according
to
the
thüringian
chronicles
bitter
cries
and
moans
were
heard
issuing
from
this
cavern
and
at
night
wild
shrieks
and
the
burst
of
diabolical
laughter
would
ring
from
it
over
the
vale
and
fill
the
inhabitants
with
terror
it
was
supposed
that
this
hole
gave
admittance
to
purgatory
and
the
popular
but
faulty
derivation
of
hörsel
was
die
hark
the
souls
but
another
popular
belief
respecting
this
mountain
was
that
in
it
venus
the
pagan
goddess
of
love
held
her
court
in
all
the
pomp
and
revelry
of
heathendom
and
there
were
not
a
few
who
declared
that
they
had
seen
fair
forms
of
female
beauty
beckoning
them
from
the
mouth
of
the
chasm
and
that
they
had
heard
dulcet
strains
of
music
well
up
from
the
abyss
above
the
thunder
of
the
falling
unseen
torrent
charmed
by
the
music
and
allured
by
the
spectral
forms
various
individuals
had
entered
the
cave
and
none
had
returned
except
the
tanhäuser
of
whom
more
anon
still
does
the
hörselberg
go
by
the
name
of
the
venusberg
a
name
frequently
used
in
the
middle
ages
but
without
its
locality
being
defined
in
at
midday
there
appeared
suddenly
three
great
fires
in
the
air
which
presently
ran
together
into
one
globe
of
flame
parted
again
and
finally
sank
into
the
hörselberg
says
the
thüringian
chronicle
and
now
for
the
story
of
tanhäuser
a
french
knight
was
riding
over
the
beauteous
meadows
in
the
hörsel
vale
on
his
way
to
wartburg
where
the
landgrave
hermann
was
holding
a
gathering
of
minstrels
who
were
to
contend
in
song
for
a
prize
tanhäuser
was
a
famous
minnesinger
and
all
his
lays
were
of
love
and
of
women
for
his
heart
was
full
of
passion
and
that
not
of
the
purest
and
noblest
description
it
was
towards
dusk
that
he
passed
the
cliff
in
which
is
the
hörselloch
and
as
he
rode
by
he
saw
a
white
glimmering
figure
of
matchless
beauty
standing
before
him
and
beckoning
him
to
her
he
knew
her
at
once
by
her
attributes
and
by
her
superhuman
perfection
to
be
none
other
than
venus
as
she
spake
to
him
the
sweetest
strains
of
music
floated
in
the
air
a
soft
roseate
light
glowed
around
her
and
nymphs
of
exquisite
loveliness
scattered
roses
at
her
feet
a
thrill
of
passion
ran
through
the
veins
of
the
minnesinger
and
leaving
his
horse
he
followed
the
apparition
it
led
him
up
the
mountain
to
the
cave
and
as
it
went
flowers
bloomed
upon
the
soil
and
a
radiant
track
was
left
for
tanhäuser
to
follow
he
entered
the
cavern
and
descended
to
the
palace
of
venus
in
the
heart
of
the
mountain
seven
years
of
revelry
and
debauch
were
passed
and
the
heart
began
to
feel
a
strange
void
the
beauty
the
magnificence
the
variety
of
the
scenes
in
the
pagan
goddess
home
and
all
its
heathenish
pleasures
palled
upon
him
and
he
yearned
for
the
pure
fresh
breezes
of
earth
one
look
up
at
the
dark
night
sky
spangled
with
stars
one
glimpse
of
simple
one
tinkle
of
at
the
same
time
his
conscience
began
to
reproach
him
and
he
longed
to
make
his
peace
with
god
in
vain
did
he
entreat
venus
to
permit
him
to
depart
and
it
was
only
when
in
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
he
called
upon
the
that
a
rift
in
the
appeared
to
him
and
he
stood
again
above
ground
how
sweet
was
the
morning
air
balmy
with
the
scent
of
hay
as
it
rolled
up
the
mountain
to
him
and
fanned
his
haggard
cheek
how
delightful
to
him
was
the
cushion
of
moss

after
the
downy
couches
of
the
palace
of
revelry
below
he
plucked
the
little
and
held
them
before
him
the
tears
rolled
from
his
eyes
and
moistened
his
thin
and
wasted
hands
he
looked
up
at
the
soft
blue
sky
and
the
sun
and
his
heart
overflowed
what
were
the
golden
vaults
beneath
to
that
pure
dome
of
god
building
the
chime
of
a
village
church
struck
sweetly
on
his
ear
satiated
with
bacchanalian
songs
and
he
hurried
down
the
mountain
to
the
church
which
called
him
there
he
made
his
confession
but
the
priest
at
his
recital
dared
not
give
him
absolution
but
passed
him
on
to
another
and
so
he
went
from
one
to
another
till
at
last
he
was
referred
to
the
pope
himself
to
the
pope
he
went
urban
iv
then
occupied
the
chair
of
peter
to
him
tanhäuser
related
the
sickening
story
of
his
guilt
and
prayed
for
absolution
urban
was
a
hard
and
stern
man
and
shocked
at
the
immensity
of
the
sin
he
thrust
the
penitent
indignantly
from
him
exclaiming
guilt
such
as
thine
can
never
never
be
remitted
sooner
shall
this
staff
in
my
hand
grow
green
and
blossom
than
that
god
should
pardon
thee
then
tanhäuser
full
of
despair
and
with
his
soul
darkened
went
away
and
returned
to
the
only
asylum
open
to
him
the
venusberg
but
lo
three
days
after
he
had
gone
urban
discovered
that
his
pastoral
staff
had
put
forth
buds
and
had
burst
into
flower
then
he
sent
messengers
after
tanhäuser
and
they
reached
the
hörsel
vale
to
hear
that
a
wayworn
man
with
haggard
brow
and
bowed
head
had
just
entered
the
hörselloch
since
then
tanhäuser
has
not
been
seen
such
is
the
sad
yet
beautiful
story
of
tanhäuser
it
is
a
very
ancient
myth
christianized
a
tradition
localized
originally
heathen
it
has
been
transformed
and
has
acquired
new
beauty
by
an
infusion
of
christianity
scattered
over
europe
it
exists
in
various
forms
but
in
none
so
graceful
as
that
attached
to
the
hörselberg
there
are
however
other
venusbergs
in
germany
as
for
instance
in
swabia
near
waldsee
another
near
ufhausen
at
no
great
distance
from
freiburg
the
same
story
is
told
of
this
venusberg
as
of
the
hörselberg
in
saxony
there
is
a
venusberg
not
far
from
wolkenstein
paracelsus
speaks
of
a
venusberg
in
italy
referring
to
that
in
which
æneas
sylvius
ep
says
venus
or
a
sibyl
resides
occupying
a
cavern
and
assuming
once
a
week
the
form
of
a
serpent
geiler
keysersperg
a
quaint
old
preacher
of
the
fifteenth
century
speaks
of
the
witches
assembling
on
the
venusberg
the
story
either
in
prose
or
verse
has
often
been
printed
some
of
the
earliest
editions
are

let
us
now
see
some
of
the
forms
which
this
remarkable
myth
assumed
in
other
countries
every
popular
tale
has
its
root
a
root
which
may
be
traced
among
different
countries
and
though
the
accidents
of
the
story
may
vary
yet
the
substance
remains
unaltered
it
has
been
said
that
the
common
people
never
invent
new
any
more
than
we
invent
new
and
this
is
perfectly
true
the
same
remains
but
it
is
varied
according
to
the
temperament
of
the
narrator
or
the
exigencies
of
localization
the
of
the
venusberg
is
this
the
underground
folk
seek
union
with
human
beings
α
a
man
is
enticed
into
their
abode
where
he
unites
with
a
woman
of
the
underground
race
β
he
desires
to
revisit
the
earth
and
escapes
γ
he
returns
again
to
the
region
below
now
there
is
scarcely
a
collection
of
which
does
not
contain
a
story
founded
on
this
root
it
appears
in
every
branch
of
the
aryan
family
and
examples
might
be
quoted
from
modern
greek
albanian
neapolitan
french
german
danish
norwegian
and
swedish
icelandic
scotch
welsh
and
other
collections
of
popular
tales
i
have
only
space
to
mention
some
there
is
a
norse
tháttr
of
a
certain
helgi
thorir
son
which
is
in
its
present
form
a
production
of
the
fourteenth
century
helgi
and
his
brother
thorstein
went
on
a
cruise
to
finnmark
or
lapland
they
reached
a
ness
and
found
the
land
covered
with
forest
helgi
explored
this
forest
and
lighted
suddenly
on
a
party
of
women
riding
upon
red
horses
these
ladies
were
beautiful
and
of
troll
race
one
surpassed
the
others
in
beauty
and
she
was
their
mistress
they
erected
a
tent
and
prepared
a
feast
helgi
observed
that
all
their
vessels
were
of
silver
and
gold
the
lady
who
named
herself
ingibjorg
advanced
towards
the
norseman
and
invited
him
to
live
with
her
he
feasted
and
lived
with
the
trolls
for
three
days
and
then
returned
to
his
ship
bringing
with
him
two
chests
of
silver
and
gold
which
ingibjorg
had
given
him
he
had
been
forbidden
to
mention
where
he
had
been
and
with
whom
so
he
told
no
one
whence
he
had
obtained
the
chests
the
ships
sailed
and
he
returned
home
one
winter
night
helgi
was
fetched
away
from
home
in
the
midst
of
a
furious
storm
by
two
mysterious
horsemen
and
no
one
was
able
to
ascertain
for
many
years
what
had
become
of
him
till
the
prayers
of
the
king
olaf
obtained
his
release
and
then
he
was
restored
to
his
father
and
brother
but
he
was
thenceforth
blind
all
the
time
of
his
absence
he
had
been
with
the
lady
in
her
mysterious
abode
of
glœsisvellir
the
scotch
story
of
thomas
of
ercildoune
is
the
same
story
thomas
met
with
a
strange
lady
of
elfin
race
beneath
eildon
tree
who
led
him
into
the
underground
land
where
he
remained
with
her
for
seven
years
he
then
returned
to
earth
still
however
remaining
bound
to
come
to
his
royal
mistress
whenever
she
should
summon
him
accordingly
while
thomas
was
making
merry
with
his
friends
in
the
tower
of
ercildoune
a
person
came
running
in
and
told
with
marks
of
fear
and
astonishment
that
a
hart
and
a
hind
had
left
the
neighboring
forest
and
were
parading
the
street
of
the
village
thomas
instantly
arose
left
his
house
and
followed
the
animals
into
the
forest
from
which
he
never
returned
according
to
popular
belief
he
still
drees
his
weird
in
fairy
land
and
is
one
day
expected
to
revisit
earth
scott
minstrelsy
of
the
scottish
border
compare
with
this
the
ancient
ballad
of
tamlane
debes
relates
that
it
happened
a
good
while
since
when
the
burghers
of
bergen
had
the
commerce
of
the
faroe
isles
that
there
was
a
man
in
serraade
called
jonas
soideman
who
was
kept
by
the
spirits
in
a
mountain
during
the
space
of
seven
years
and
at
length
came
out
but
lived
afterwards
in
great
distress
and
fear
lest
they
should
again
take
him
away
wherefore
people
were
obliged
to
watch
him
in
the
night
the
same
author
mentions
another
young
man
who
had
been
carried
away
and
after
his
return
was
removed
a
second
time
upon
the
eve
of
his
marriage
gervase
of
tilbury
says
that
in
catalonia
there
is
a
lofty
mountain
named
cavagum
at
the
foot
of
which
runs
a
river
with
golden
sands
in
the
vicinity
of
which
there
are
likewise
silver
mines
this
mountain
is
steep
and
almost
inaccessible
on
its
top
which
is
always
covered
with
ice
and
snow
is
a
black
and
bottomless
lake
into
which
if
a
stone
be
cast
a
tempest
suddenly
arises
and
near
this
lake
is
the
portal
of
the
palace
of
demons
he
then
tells
how
a
young
damsel
was
spirited
in
there
and
spent
seven
years
with
the
mountain
spirits
on
her
return
to
earth
she
was
thin
and
withered
with
wandering
eyes
and
almost
bereft
of
understanding
a
swedish
story
is
to
this
effect
a
young
man
was
on
his
way
to
his
bride
when
he
was
allured
into
a
mountain
by
a
beautiful
elfin
woman
with
her
he
lived
forty
years
which
passed
as
an
hour
on
his
return
to
earth
all
his
old
friends
and
relations
were
dead
or
had
forgotten
him
and
finding
no
rest
there
he
returned
to
his
mountain
in
pomerania
a
laborer
son
jacob
dietrich
of
rambin
was
enticed
away
in
the
same
manner
there
is
a
curious
story
told
by
fordun
in
his
scotichronicon
which
has
some
interest
in
connection
with
the
legend
of
the
tanhäuser
he
relates
that
in
the
year
a
youth
of
noble
birth
had
been
married
in
rome
and
during
the
nuptial
feast
being
engaged
in
a
game
of
ball
he
took
off
his
and
placed
it
on
the
finger
of
a
statue
of
venus
when
he
wished
to
resume
it
he
found
that
the
stony
hand
had
become
clinched
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
remove
the
ring
thenceforth
he
was
haunted
by
the
goddess
venus
who
constantly
whispered
in
his
ear
embrace
me
i
am
venus
whom
you
have
wedded
i
will
never
restore
your
ring
however
by
the
assistance
of
a
priest
she
was
at
length
forced
to
give
it
up
to
its
rightful
owner
the
classic
legend
of
ulysses
held
captive
for
eight
years
by
the
nymph
calypso
in
the
island
of
ogygia
and
again
for
one
year
by
the
enchantress
circe
contains
the
root
of
the
same
story
of
the
tanhäuser
what
may
have
been
the
significance
of
the
primeval
it
is
impossible
for
us
now
to
ascertain
but
the
legend
as
it
shaped
itself
in
the
middle
ages
is
certainly
indicative
of
the
struggle
between
the
new
and
the
old
faith
we
see
thinly
veiled
in
tanhäuser
the
story
of
a
man
christian
in
name
but
heathen
at
heart
allured
by
the
attractions
of
paganism
which
seems
to
satisfy
his
poetic
instincts
and
which
gives
full
rein
to
his
passions
but
these
excesses
pall
on
him
after
a
while
and
the
religion
of
sensuality
leaves
a
great
void
in
his
breast
he
turns
to
christianity
and
at
first
it
seems
to
promise
all
that
he
requires
but
alas
he
is
repelled
by
its
ministers
on
all
sides
he
is
met
by
practice
widely
at
variance
with
profession
pride
worldliness
want
of
sympathy
exist
among
those
who
should
be
the
foremost
to
guide
sustain
and
receive
him
all
the
warm
springs
which
gushed
up
in
his
broken
heart
are
choked
his
softened
spirit
is
hardened
again
and
he
returns
in
despair
to
bury
his
sorrows
and
drown
his
anxieties
in
the
debauchery
of
his
former
creed
a
sad
picture
but
doubtless
one
very
true
fatality
of
numbers
the
laws
governing
numbers
are
so
perplexing
to
the
uncultivated
mind
and
the
results
arrived
at
by
calculation
are
so
astonishing
that
it
can
not
be
matter
of
surprise
if
superstition
has
attached
itself
to
numbers
but
even
to
those
who
are
instructed
in
numeration
there
is
much
that
is
mysterious
and
unaccountable
much
that
only
an
advanced
mathematician
can
explain
to
his
own
satisfaction
the
neophyte
sees
the
numbers
obedient
to
certain
laws
but
they
obey
these
laws
he
can
not
understand
and
the
fact
of
his
not
being
able
so
to
do
tends
to
give
to
numbers
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
which
impresses
him
with
awe
for
instance
the
property
of
the
number
discovered
i
believe
by
green
who
died
in
is
inexplicable
to
any
one
but
a
mathematician
the
property
to
which
i
allude
is
this
that
when
is
multiplied
by
by
by
by
by
it
will
be
found
that
the
digits
composing
the
product
when
added
together
give
thus
and
it
will
be
noticed
that
makes
the
sum
of
the
digits
of
which
is
and
not
but
the
sum
of
the
digits
equals
and
and
so
on
to
any
extent
de
maivan
discovered
another
singular
property
of
the
same
number
if
the
order
of
the
digits
expressing
a
number
be
changed
and
this
number
be
subtracted
from
the
former
the
remainder
will
be
or
a
multiple
of
and
being
a
multiple
the
sum
of
its
digits
will
be
for
instance
take
the
number
reverse
the
digits
and
you
have
subtract
from
and
the
remainder
is
take
reverse
the
digits
and
subtract
from
you
have
a
multiple
of
and
once
more
the
number
is
the
reverse
of
the
difference
between
these
numbers
is
or
twice
again
the
same
property
found
in
two
numbers
thus
changed
is
discovered
in
the
same
numbers
raised
to
any
power
take
and
again
the
square
of
is
and
the
square
of
is

and
the
remainder
is
a
multiple
of
besides
the
digits
expressing
these
powers
added
together
give
the
cube
of
is
and
that
of
is
their
difference
is
also
a
multiple
of
the
number
has
also
somewhat
remarkable
properties
when
multiplied
by
or
a
multiple
of
up
to
it
gives
in
the
product
three
digits
exactly
similar
from
the
knowledge
of
this
the
multiplication
of
is
greatly
facilitated
the
method
to
be
adopted
being
to
multiply
merely
the
first
cipher
of
the
multiplicand
by
the
first
multiplier
it
is
then
unnecessary
to
proceed
with
the
multiplication
it
being
sufficient
to
write
twice
to
the
right
hand
the
cipher
obtained
so
that
the
same
digit
will
stand
in
the
unit
tens
and
hundreds
places
for
instance
take
the
results
of
the
following
table
multiplied
by
gives
and
times
the
singular
property
of
numbers
the
most
different
when
added
to
produce
the
same
sum
originated
the
use
of
magical
squares
for
talismans
although
the
reason
may
be
accounted
for
mathematically
yet
numerous
authors
have
written
concerning
them
as
though
there
were
something
uncanny
about
them
but
the
most
remarkable
and
exhaustive
treatise
on
the
subject
is
that
by
a
mathematician
of

the

with

was
sufficient
besides
their
marvellous
properties
to
make
superstition
attach
itself
to
them

there
were

at

when

was
celebrated
and
one
of
the
number
betrayed
his

and

looked
upon
through
christendom
as
unlucky
to
sit
down
thirteen
at
table
the
consequence
being
that
one
of
the
number
will
die
before

says

the

of
all
it
is
this
sublime

it

on
unity
of
sentiments
consequently
one
is
a
good
principle
the
number
two
or
the
dyad
the
origin
of
contrasts
is
the
symbol
of
diversity
or
inequality
of
division
and
of
separation
two
is
accordingly
an
evil
principle
a
number
of
bad
augury
characterizing
disorder
confusion
and
change
three
or
the
triad
is
the
first
of
unequals
it
is
the
number
containing
the
most
sublime
mysteries
for
everything
is
composed
of
three
substances
it
represents
god
the
soul
of
the
world
the
spirit
of
man
this
number
which
plays
so
great
a
part
in
the
traditions
of
asia
and
in
the
platonic
philosophy
is
the
image
of
the
attributes
of
god
four
or
the
tetrad
as
the
first
mathematical
power
is
also
one
of
the
chief
elements
it
represents
the
generating
virtue
whence
come
all
combinations
it
is
the
most
perfect
of
numbers
it
is
the
root
of
all
things
it
is
holy
by
nature
since
it
constitutes
the
divine
essence
by
recalling
his
unity
his
power
his
goodness
and
his
wisdom
the
four
perfections
which
especially
characterize
god
consequently
pythagoricians
swear
by
the
quaternary
number
which
gives
the
human
soul
its
eternal
nature
the
number
five
or
the
pentad
has
a
peculiar
force
in
sacred
expiations
it
is
everything
it
stops
the
power
of
poisons
and
is
redoubted
by
evil
spirits
the
number
six
or
the
hexad
is
a
fortunate
number
and
it
derives
its
merit
from
the
first
sculptors
having
divided
the
face
into
six
portions
but
according
to
the
chaldeans
the
reason
is
because
god
created
the
world
in
six
days
seven
or
the
heptad
is
a
number
very
powerful
for
good
or
for
evil
it
belongs
especially
to
sacred
things
the
number
eight
or
the
octad
is
the
first
cube
that
is
to
say
squared
in
all
senses
as
a
die
proceeding
from
its
base
two
an
even
number
so
is
man
or
perfect
the
number
nine
or
the
ennead
being
the
multiple
of
three
should
be
regarded
as
sacred
finally
ten
or
the
decad
is
the
measure
of
all
since
it
contains
all
the
numeric
relations
and
harmonies
as
the
reunion
of
the
four
first
numbers
it
plays
an
eminent
part
since
all
the
branches
of
science
all
nomenclatures
emanate
from
and
retire
into
it
it
is
hardly
necessary
for
me
here
to
do
more
than
mention
the
peculiar
character
given
to
different
numbers
by
christianity
one
is
the
numeral
indicating
the
unity
of
the
godhead
two
points
to
the
hypostatic
union
three
to
the
blessed
trinity
four
to
the
evangelists
five
to
the
sacred
wounds
six
is
the
number
of
sin
seven
that
of
the
gifts
of
the
spirit
eight
that
of
the
beatitudes
ten
is
the
number
of
the
commandments
eleven
speaks
of
the
apostles
after
the
loss
of
judas
twelve
of
the
complete
apostolic
college
i
shall
now
point
out
certain
numbers
which
have
been
regarded
with
superstition
and
certain
events
connected
with
numbers
which
are
of
curious
interest
the
number
has
often
been
observed
as
having
singularly
influenced
the
life
of
henry
iv
and
other
french
princes
let
us
take
the
history
of
henry
on
the
may
the
first
king
of
france
named
henry
was
consecrated
and
on
the
may
the
last
henry
was
assassinated
fourteen
letters
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
name
of
henri
de
bourbon
who
was
the
king
bearing
the
titles
of
france
and
navarre
the
december
that
is
centuries
decades
and
years
after
the
birth
of
christ
henry
iv
was
born
the
ciphers
of
the
date
when
added
together
giving
the
number
the
may
henry
ii
ordered
the
enlargement
of
the
rue
de
la
ferronnerie
the
circumstance
of
this
order
not
having
been
carried
out
occasioned
the
murder
of
henry
iv
in
that
street
four
times
years
after
the
may
was
the
date
of
the
birth
of
marguérite
de
valois
first
wife
of
henry
iv
on
the
may
the
parisians
revolted
against
henry
at
the
instigation
of
the
duke
of
guise
on
the
march
henry
iv
gained
the
battle
of
ivry
on
the
may
henry
was
repulsed
from
the
fauxbourgs
of
paris
on
the
november
the
sixteen
took
oath
to
die
rather
than
serve
henry
on
the
november
the
parliament
registered
the
papal
bull
giving
power
to
the
legate
to
nominate
a
king
to
the
exclusion
of
henry
on
the
december
the
duke
of
savoy
was
reconciled
to
henry
iv
on
the
september
the
dauphin
afterwards
louis
was
baptized
on
the
may
the
king
was
stopped
in
the
rue
de
la
ferronnerie
by
his
carriage
becoming
locked
with
a
cart
on
account
of
the
narrowness
of
the
street
ravaillac
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
for
stabbing
him
henry
iv
lived
four
times
years
weeks
and
four
times
days
that
is
to
say
years
and
months
on
the
may
died
louis
son
of
henry
iv
not
only
on
the
same
day
of
the
same
month
as
his
father
but
the
date
when
its
ciphers
are
added
together
gives
the
number
just
as
the
ciphers
of
the
date
of
the
birth
of
his
father
gave
louis
xiv
mounted
the
throne
in
he
died
in
the
year
he
lived
years
and
louis
xv
mounted
the
throne
in
the
same
year
he
died
in
which
also
bears
the
stamp
of
the
extremes
being
and
the
sum
of
the
means
making
louis
xvi
had
reigned
years
when
he
convoked
the
states
general
which
was
to
bring
about
the
revolution
the
number
of
years
between
the
assassination
of
henry
iv
and
the
dethronement
of
louis
xvi
is
divisible
by
louis
xvii
died
in
the
extreme
digits
of
the
date
are
and
the
first
two
give
his
number
the
restoration
of
the
bourbons
took
place
in
also
marked
by
the
extremes
being
also
by
the
sum
of
the
ciphers
making
the
following
are
other
curious
calculations
made
respecting
certain
french
kings
add
the
ciphers
composing
the
year
of
the
birth
or
of
the
death
of
some
of
the
kings
of
the
third
race
and
the
result
of
each
sum
is
the
titular
number
of
each
prince
thus
louis
ix
was
born
in
add
the
four
ciphers
of
this
date
and
you
have
ix
charles
vii
was
born
in
the
sum
of
gives
vii
louis
xii
was
born
in
and
xii
henry
iv
died
in
and
twice
iv
louis
xiv
was
crowned
in
and
these
four
ciphers
give
xiv
the
same
king
died
in
and
this
date
gives
also
xiv
he
was
aged
years
and
again
louis
xviii
was
born
in
add
the
digits
and
you
have
xviii
what
is
remarkable
is
that
this
number
is
double
the
number
of
the
king
to
whom
the
law
first
applies
and
is
triple
the
number
of
the
kings
to
whom
it
has
applied
here
is
another
curious
calculation
robespierre
fell
in
napoleon
in
and
charles
in
now
the
remarkable
fact
in
connection
with
these
dates
is
that
the
sum
of
the
digits
composing
them
added
to
the
dates
gives
the
date
of
the
fall
of
the
successor
robespierre
fell
in
the
date
of
the
fall
of
napoleon
and
the
date
of
the
fall
of
charles
x
there
is
a
singular
rule
which
has
been
supposed
to
determine
the
length
of
the
reigning
pope
life
in
the
earlier
half
of
a
century
add
his
number
to
that
of
his
predecessor
to
that
add
ten
and
the
result
gives
the
year
of
his
death
pius
vii
succeeded
pius
vi
add
and
the
sum
is
pius
vii
died
in
leo
xii
succeeded
pius
vii
and
leo
xii
died
in
pius
viii
succeeded
leo
xii
and
pius
viii
died
in
however
this
calculation
does
not
always
apply
gregory
xvi
ought
to
have
died
in
but
he
did
not
actually
vacate
his
see
till
it
is
also
well
known
that
an
ancient
tradition
forbids
the
hope
of
any
of
peter
successors
ad
annos
to
reign
years
those
who
sat
longest
are
years
months
days
pius
who
reigned
hadrian
pius
alexander
silvester
there
is
one
numerical
curiosity
of
a
very
remarkable
character
which
i
must
not
omit
the
ancient
chamber
of
deputies
such
as
it
existed
in
was
composed
of
members
and
was
divided
into
two
parties
the
one
numbering
members
declared
itself
strongly
for
the
revolution
of
july
the
other
party
numbering
did
not
favor
a
change
the
result
was
the
constitutional
monarchy
which
order
after
the
three
memorable
days
of
july
the
parties
were
known
by
the
following
nicknames
the
larger
was
commonly
called
queue
de
and
the
smaller
honnêtes
now
the
remarkable
fact
is
that
if
we
give
to
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
their
numerical
values
as
they
stand
in
their
order
as
for
a
for
b
for
c
and
so
on
to
z
which
is
valued
at
and
then
write
vertically
on
the
left
hand
the
words
queue
de
with
the
number
equivalent
to
each
letter
opposite
to
it
and
on
the
right
hand
in
like
manner
honnêtes
if
each
column
of
numbers
be
summed
up
the
result
is

loys
the
terrestrial
paradise
the
exact
position
of
eden
and
its
present
condition
do
not
seem
to
have
occupied
the
minds
of
our
ancestors
nor
to
have
given
rise
among
them
to
wild
speculations
the
map
of
the
tenth
century
in
the
british
museum
accompanying
the
periegesis
of
priscian
is
far
more
correct
than
the
generality
of
maps
which
we
find
in
mss
at
a
later
period
and
paradise
does
not
occupy
the
place
of
cochin
china
or
the
isles
of
japan
as
it
did
later
after
that
the
fabulous
voyage
of
brandan
had
become
popular
in
the
eleventh
century
the
site
however
had
been
already
indicated
by
cosmas
who
wrote
in
the
seventh
century
and
had
been
specified
by
him
as
occupying
a
continent
east
of
china
beyond
the
ocean
and
still
watered
by
the
four
great
rivers
pison
gihon
hiddekel
and
euphrates
which
sprang
from
subterranean
canals
in
a
map
of
the
ninth
century
preserved
in
the
strasbourg
library
the
terrestrial
paradise
is
however
on
the
continent
placed
at
the
extreme
east
of
asia
in
fact
is
situated
in
the
celestial
empire
it
occupies
the
same
position
in
a
turin
and
also
in
a
map
accompanying
a
commentary
on
the
apocalypse
in
the
british
museum
according
to
the
fictitious
letter
of
prester
john
to
the
emperor
emanuel
comnenus
paradise
was
situated
close
to
within
three
journey
of
his
own
territories
but
where
those
territories
were
is
not
distinctly
specified
the
river
indus
which
issues
out
of
paradise
writes
the
mythical
king
flows
among
the
plains
through
a
certain
province
and
it
expands
embracing
the
whole
province
with
its
various
windings
there
are
found
emeralds
sapphires
carbuncles
topazes
chrysolites
onyx
beryl
sardius
and
many
other
precious
stones
there
too
grows

plant
called
asbetos
a
wonderful
fountain
moreover
breaks
out
at
the
roots
of
olympus
a
mountain
in
prester
john
domain
and
from
hour
to
hour
and
day
by
day
the
taste
of
this
fountain
varies
and
its
source
is
hardly
three
days
journey
from
paradise
from
which
adam
was
expelled
if
any
man
drinks
thrice
of
this
spring
he
will
from
that
day
feel
no
infirmity
and
he
will
as
long
as
he
lives
appear
of
the
age
of
thirty
this
olympus
is
a
corruption
of
alumbo
which
is
no
other
than
columbo
in
ceylon
as
is
abundantly
evident
from
sir
john
mandeville
travels
though
this
important
fountain
has
escaped
the
observation
of

the

in
an
unapproachable
region
of

surrounded
by
flames
and
having
an
armed

to
guard
the

lambertus
floridus
in
a
of
the
twelfth
century
preserved
in
the
imperial
library
in
paris
describes
it
as
paradisus
insula
in
oceano
in
oriente
and
in
the
map
accompanying
it
paradise
is
represented
as
an
island
a
little
of
asia
surrounded
by
rays
and
at
some
distance
from
the
main
land
and
in
another
of
the
same
library
a
mediæval
encyclopædia
under
the
word
paradisus
is
a
passage
which
states
that
in
the
centre
of
paradise
is
a
fountain
which
waters
the
garden
that
in
fact
described
by
prester
john
and
that
of
which
sir
john
mandeville
declared
he
had
dronken

close
to
this
fountain
is
the
tree
of

the
temperature
of
the
country
is
equable
neither
frosts
nor
burning
heats
destroy
the
vegetation
the
four
rivers
already
mentioned
rise
in
it
paradise
is
however
inaccessible
to
the
traveller
on
account
of
the
wall
of
fire
which
surrounds
it
paludanus
relates
in
his
thesaurus
novus
of
course
on
incontrovertible
authority
that
alexander
the
great
was
full
of
desire
to
see
the
terrestrial
paradise
and
that
he
undertook
his
wars
in
the
east
for
the
express
purpose
of
reaching
it
and
obtaining
admission
into
it
he
states
that
on
his
nearing
eden
an
old
man
was
captured
in
a
ravine
by
some
of
alexander
soldiers
and
they
were
about
to
conduct
him
to
their
monarch
when
the
venerable
man
said
go
and
announce
to
alexander
that
it
is
in
vain
he
seeks
paradise
his
efforts
will
be
perfectly
fruitless
for
the
way
of
paradise
is
the
way
of
humility
a
way
of
which
he
knows
nothing
take
this
stone
and
give
it
to
alexander
and
say
to
him
this
stone
learn
what
you
must
think
of
yourself
now
this
stone
was
of
great
value
and
excessively
heavy
outweighing
and
excelling
in
value
all
other
gems
but
when
reduced
to
powder
it
was
as
light
as
a
tuft
of
hay
and
as
worthless
by
which
token
the
mysterious
old
man
meant
that
alexander
alive
was
the
greatest
of
monarchs
but
alexander
dead
would
be
a
thing
of
nought
that
strangest
of
mediæval
preachers
meffreth
who
got
into
trouble
by
denying
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
blessed
virgin
in
his
second
sermon
for
the
third
sunday
in
advent
discusses
the
locality
of
the
terrestrial
paradise
and
claims
st
basil
and
ambrose
as
his
authorities
for
stating
that
it
is
situated
on
the
top
of
a
very
lofty
mountain
in
eastern
asia
so
lofty
indeed
is
the
mountain
that
the
waters
of
the
four
rivers
fall
in
cascade
down
to
a
lake
at
its
foot
with
such
a
roar
that
the
natives
who
live
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
are
meffreth
also
explains
the
escape
of
paradise
from
submergence
at
the
deluge
on
the
same
grounds
as
does
the
master
of
sentences
lib

by
the
mountain
being
so
very
high
that
the
waters
which
rose
over
ararat
were
only
able
to
wash
the
base
of
the
mountain
of
paradise
the
hereford
map
of
the
thirteenth
century
represents
the
terrestrial
paradise
as
a
circular
island
near
india
cut
off
from
the
continent
not
only
by
the
sea
but
also
by
a
battlemented
wall
with

radulphus
highden
in
the
thirteenth

relying
on
the
authority
of
st
basil
and
isidore
of
seville
places
eden
in
an
inaccessible
region
of
oriental
asia
and
this
was
also
the
opinion
of
philostorgus
hugo
de
victor
in
his
book
de
situ
terrarum
expresses
himself
thus
paradise
is
a
spot
in
the
orient
productive
of
all
kind
of
woods
and
pomiferous
trees
it
contains
the
tree
of
life
there
is
neither
cold
nor
heat
there
but
perpetual
equable
temperature
it
contains
a
fountain
which
flows
forth
in
four
rivers
rabanus
maurus
with
more
discretion
says
many
folk
want
to
make
out
that
the
site
of
paradise
is
in
the
east
of
the
earth
though
cut
off
by
the
longest
intervening
space
of
ocean
or
earth
from
all
regions
which
man
now
inhabits
consequently
the
waters
of
the
deluge
which
covered
the
highest
points
of
the
surface
of
our
orb
were
unable
to
reach
it
however
whether
it
be
there
or
whether
it
be
anywhere
else
god
knows
but
that
there
such
a
spot
once
and
that
it
was
on
earth
that
is
certain
jacques
de
vitry
historia
orientalis
gervais
of
tilbury
in
his
otia
imperalia
and
many
others
hold
the
same
views
as
to
the
site
of
paradise
that
were
entertained
by
hugo
de
victor
jourdain
de
sèverac
monk
and
traveller
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourteenth
century
places
the
terrestrial
paradise
in
the
third
india
that
is
to
say
in
india
leonardo
dati
a
florentine
poet
of
the
fifteenth
century
composed
a
geographical
treatise
in
verse
entitled
della
sfera
and
it
is
in
asia
that
he
locates
the
garden
asia
e
le
prima
parte
dove
sendo
innocente
stava
in
paradiso
but
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
account
of
the
terrestrial
paradise
ever
furnished
is
that
of
the
eireks
saga
vídförla
an
icelandic
narrative
of
the
fourteenth
century
giving
the
adventures
of
a
certain
norwegian
named
eirek
who
had
vowed
whilst
a
heathen
that
he
would
explore
the
fabulous
deathless
land
of
pagan
scandinavian
mythology
the
romance
is
possibly
a
christian
recension
of
an
ancient
heathen
myth
and
paradise
has
taken
the
place
in
it
of
glœsisvellir
according
to
the
majority
of
the
mss
the
story
purports
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
religious
novel
but
one
audacious
copyist
has
ventured
to
assert
that
it
is
all
fact
and
that
the
details
are
taken
down
from
the
lips
of
those
who
heard
them
from
eirek
himself
the
account
is
briefly
this
eirek
was
a
son
of
thrand
king
of
drontheim
and
having
taken
upon
him
a
vow
to
explore
the
deathless
land
he
went
to
denmark
where
he
picked
up
a
friend
of
the
same
name
as
himself
they
then
went
to
constantinople
and
called
upon
the
emperor
who
held
a
long
conversation
with
them
which
is
duly
reported
relative
to
the
truths
of
christianity
and
the
site
of
the
deathless
land
which
he
assures
them
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
paradise
the
world
said
the
monarch
who
had
not
forgotten
his
geography
since
he
left
school
is
precisely
stages
round
about
english
miles
and
it
is
not
propped
up
on
posts
not
a
bit
it
is
supported
by
the
power
of
god
and
the
distance
between
earth
and
heaven
is
miles
another
reads
miles
the
difference
is
immaterial
and
round
about
the
earth
is
a
big
sea
called
ocean
and
what
to
the
south
of
the
earth
asked
eirek
o
there
is
the
end
of
the
world
and
that
is
india
and
pray
where
am
i
to
find
the
deathless
land
that
lies
paradise
i
suppose
you
mean
well
it
lies
slightly
east
of
india
having
obtained
this
information
the
two
eireks
started
furnished
with
letters
from
the
greek
emperor
they
traversed
syria
and
took
ship
probably
at
balsora
then
reaching
india
they
proceeded
on
their
journey
on
horseback
till
they
came
to
a
dense
forest
the
gloom
of
which
was
so
great
through
the
interlacing
of
the
boughs
that
even
by
day
the
stars
could
be
observed
twinkling
as
though
they
were
seen
from
the
bottom
of
a
well
on
emerging
from
the
forest
the
two
eireks
came
upon
a
strait
separating
them
from
a
beautiful
land
which
was
unmistakably
paradise
and
the
danish
eirek
intent
on
displaying
his
scriptural
knowledge
pronounced
the
strait
to
be
the
river
pison
this
was
crossed
by
a
stone
bridge
guarded
by
a
dragon
the
danish
eirek
deterred
by
the
prospect
of
an
encounter
with
this
monster
refused
to
advance
and
even
endeavored
to
persuade
his
friend
to
give
up
the
attempt
to
enter
paradise
as
hopeless
after
that
they
had
come
within
sight
of
the
favored
land
but
the
norseman
deliberately
walked
sword
in
hand
into
the
maw
of
the
dragon
and
next
moment
to
his
infinite
surprise
and
delight
found
himself
liberated
from
the
gloom
of
the
monster
interior
and
safely
placed
in
paradise
the
land
was
most
beautiful
and
the
grass
as
gorgeous
as
purple
it
was
studded
with
flowers
and
was
traversed
by
honey
rills
the
land
was
extensive
and
level
so
that
there
was
not
to
be
seen
mountain
or
hill
and
the
sun
shone
cloudless
without
night
and
darkness
the
calm
of
the
air
was
great
and
there
was
but
a
feeble
murmur
of
wind
and
that
which
there
was
breathed
redolent
with
the
odor
of
blossoms
after
a
short
walk
eirek
observed
what
certainly
must
have
been
a
remarkable
object
namely
a
tower
or
steeple
in
the
air
without
any
support
whatever
though
access
might
be
had
to
it
by
means
of
a
slender
ladder
by
this
eirek
ascended
into
a
loft
of
the
tower
and
found
there
an
excellent
cold
collation
prepared
for
him
after
having
partaken
of
this
he
went
to
sleep
and
in
vision
beheld
and
conversed
with
his
guardian
angel
who
promised
to
conduct
him
back
to
his
fatherland
but
to
come
for
him
again
and
fetch
him
away
from
it
forever
at
the
expiration
of
the
tenth
year
after
his
return
to
dronheim
eirek
then
retraced
his
steps
to
india
unmolested
by
the
dragon
which
did
not
affect
any
surprise
at
having
to
disgorge
him
and
indeed
which
seems
to
have
been
notwithstanding
his
looks
but
a
harmless
and
passive
dragon
after
a
tedious
journey
of
seven
years
eirek
reached
his
native
land
where
he
related
his
adventures
to
the
confusion
of
the
heathen
and
to
the
delight
and
edification
of
the
faithful
and
in
the
tenth
year
and
at
break
of
day
as
eirek
went
to
prayer
god
spirit
caught
him
away
and
he
was
never
seen
again
in
this
world
so
here
ends
all
we
have
to
say
of
him
the
saga
of
which
i
have
given
the
merest
outline
is
certainly
striking
and
contains
some
beautiful
passages
it
follows
the
opinion
which
identified
paradise
with
ceylon
and
indeed
an
earlier
icelandic
work
the
rymbegla
indicates
the
locality
of
the
terrestrial
paradise
as
being
near
india
for
it
speaks
of
the
ganges
as
taking
its
rise
in
the
mountains
of
eden
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
curious
history
of
eirek
if
not
a
christianized
version
of
a
heathen
myth
may
contain
the
tradition
of
a
real
expedition
to
india
by
one
of
the
hardy
adventurers
who
overran
europe
explored
the
north
of

harrowed

tact
may
afford
the
real
clew
to
much
of
her
mysterious
ascendency
love
seems
to
have
existed
in
her
as
a
yearning
of
the
soul
almost
entirely
free
from
those
elements
of
passion
which
are
grounded
in
the
difference
of
the
sexes
there
was
in
it
not
so
much
of
the
desire
which
centres
in
a
single
object
as
of
the
emotion
which
seeks
to
diffuse
itself
over
the
very
widest
sphere
of
objects
it
could
thus
be
warm
and
deep
while
pure
and
inaccessible
to
evil
remark
that
she
had
carried
the
art
of
friendship
to
perfection
helps
us
here
to
give
the
true
key
to
her
character
a
warm
and
constant
friend
she
never
admitted
never
showed
herself
a
lover
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
which
gave
her
from
an
early
age
nothing
more
than
the
name
and
status
of
a
wife
she
could
let
her
natural
affection
range
with
freedom
and
security
wherever
it
met
with
a
response
that
left
intact
her
dignity
and
such
coquetry
as
she
showed
arose
rather
from
an
instinctive
desire
to
please
and
attract
than
from
anything
approaching
to
a
vicious
instinct
or
a
silly
desire
to
swell
the
list
of
her
conquests
what
seemed
to
begin
in
flirtation
never
went
to
the
point
of
danger
and
men
who
at
first
sight
loved
her
passionately
usually
ended
by
becoming
her
true
friends
