preface
nothing
can
be
more
unpresuming
than
this
little
volume
it
contains
the
account
of
some
desultory
visits
by
a
party
of
young
people
to
scenes
which
are
now
so
familiar
to
our
countrymen
that
few
facts
relating
to
them
can
be
expected
to
have
escaped
the
many
more
experienced
and
exact
observers
who
have
sent
their
journals
to
the
press
in
fact
they
have
done
little
else
than
arrange
the
few
materials
which
an
imperfect
journal
and
two
or
three
letters
to
their
friends
in
england
afforded
they
regret
since
their
little
history
is
to
be
offered
to
the
public
that
these
materials
were
not
more
copious
and
complete
this
is
a
just
topic
of
censure
to
those
who
are
less
inclined
to
be
amused
than
to
condemn
those
whose
youth
has
been
past
as
theirs
with
what
success
it
imports
not
in
pursuing
like
the
swallow
the
inconstant
summer
of
delight
and
beauty
which
invests
this
visible
world
will
perhaps
find
some
entertainment
in
following
the
author
with
her
husband
and
sister
on
foot
through
part
of
france
and
switzerland
and
in
sailing
with
her
down
the
castled
rhine
through
scenes
beautiful
in
themselves
but
which
since
she
visited
them
a
great
poet
has
clothed
with
the
freshness
of
a
diviner
nature
they
will
be
interested
to
hear
of
one
who
has
visited
mellerie
and
clarens
and
chillon
and
ground
peopled
with
tender
and
glorious
imaginations
of
the
present
and
the
past
they
have
perhaps
never
talked
with
one
who
has
beheld
in
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
the
glaciers
and
the
lakes
and
the
forests
and
the
fountains
of
the
mighty
alps
such
will
perhaps
forgive
the
imperfections
of
their
narrative
for
the
sympathy
which
the
adventures
and
feelings
which
it
recounts
and
a
curiosity
respecting
scenes
already
rendered
interesting
and
illustrious
may
excite
the
poem
entitled
mont
blanc
is
written
by
the
author
of
the
two
letters
from
chamouni
and
vevai
it
was
composed
under
the
immediate
impression
of
the
deep
and
powerful
feelings
excited
by
the
objects
which
it
attempts
to
describe
and
as
an
undisciplined
overflowing
of
the
soul
rests
its
claim
to
approbation
on
an
attempt
to
imitate
the
untameable
wildness
and
inaccessible
solemnity
from
which
those
feelings
sprang
history
of
a
six
weeks
tour
it
is
now
nearly
three
years
since
this
journey
took
place
and
the
journal
i
then
kept
was
not
very
copious
but
i
have
so
often
talked
over
the
incidents
that
befell
us
and
attempted
to
describe
the
scenery
through
which
we
passed
that
i
think
few
occurrences
of
any
interest
will
be
omitted
we
left
london
july
on
a
hotter
day
than
has
been
known
in
this
climate
for
many
years
i
am
not
a
good
traveller
and
this
heat
agreed
very
ill
with
me
till
on
arriving
at
dover
i
was
refreshed
by
a
as
we
very
much
wished
to
cross
the
channel
with
all
possible
speed
we
would
not
wait
for
the
packet
of
the
following
day
it
being
then
about
four
in
the
afternoon
but
hiring
a
small
boat
resolved
to
make
the
passage
the
same
evening
the
seamen
promising
us
a
voyage
of
two
hours
the
evening
was
most
beautiful
there
was
but
little
wind
and
the
sails
flapped
in
the
flagging
breeze
the
moon
rose
and
night
came
on
and
with
the
night
a
slow
heavy
swell
and
a
fresh
breeze
which
soon
produced
a
sea
so
violent
as
to
toss
the
boat
very
much
i
was
dreadfully
seasick
and
as
is
usually
my
custom
when
thus
affected
i
slept
during
the
greater
part
of
the
night
awaking
only
from
time
to
time
to
ask
where
we
were
and
to
receive
the
dismal
answer
each
not
quite
half
the
wind
was
violent
and
contrary
if
we
could
not
reach
calais
the
sailors
proposed
making
for
boulogne
they
promised
only
two
hours
sail
from
shore
yet
hour
after
hour
passed
and
we
were
still
far
distant
when
the
moon
sunk
in
the
red
and
stormy
horizon
and
the
lightning
became
pale
in
the
breaking
day
we
were
proceeding
slowly
against
the
wind
when
suddenly
a
thunder
squall
struck
the
sail
and
the
waves
rushed
into
the
boat
even
the
sailors
acknowledged
that
our
situation
was
perilous
but
they
succeeded
in
reefing
the
sail
wind
was
now
changed
and
we
drove
before
the
gale
directly
to
calais
as
we
entered
the
harbour
i
awoke
from
a
comfortless
sleep
and
saw
the
sun
rise
broad
red
and
cloudless
over
the
pier
france
exhausted
with
sickness
and
fatigue
i
walked
over
the
sands
with
my
companions
to
the
hotel
i
heard
for
the
first
time
the
confused
buzz
of
voices
speaking
a
different
language
from
that
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
and
saw
a
costume
very
unlike
that
worn
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
channel
the
women
with
high
caps
and
short
jackets
the
men
with
earrings
ladies
walking
about
with
high
bonnets
or
lodged
on
the
top
of
the
head
the
hair
dragged
up
underneath
without
any
stray
curls
to
decorate
the
temples
or
cheeks
there
is
however
something
very
pleasing
in
the
manners
and
appearance
of
the
people
of
calais
that
prepossesses
you
in
their
favour
a
national
reflection
might
occur
that
when
edward
iii
took
calais
he
turned
out
the
old
inhabitants
and
peopled
it
almost
entirely
with
our
own
countrymen
but
unfortunately
the
manners
are
not
english
we
remained
during
that
day
and
the
greater
part
of
the
next
at
calais
we
had
been
obliged
to
leave
our
boxes
the
night
before
at
the
english
customhouse
and
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
go
by
the
packet
of
the
following
day
which
detained
by
contrary
wind
did
not
arrive
until
night
and
i
walked
among
the
fortifications
on
the
outside
of
the
town
they
consisted
of
fields
where
the
hay
was
making
the
aspect
of
the
country
was
rural
and
pleasant
on
the
of
july
about
three
in
the
afternoon
we
left
calais
in
a
cabriolet
drawn
by
three
horses
to
persons
who
had
never
before
seen
any
thing
but
a
spruce
english
chaise
and
there
was
something
irresistibly
ludicrous
in
our
equipage
a
cabriolet
is
shaped
somewhat
like
a
except
that
it
has
only
two
wheels
and
consequently
there
are
no
doors
at
the
sides
the
front
is
let
down
to
admit
the
passengers
the
three
horses
were
placed
abreast
the
tallest
in
the
middle
who
was
rendered
more
formidable
by
the
addition
of
an
unintelligible
article
of
harness
resembling
a
pair
of
wooden
wings
fastened
to
his
shoulders
the
harnesses
were
of
rope
and
the
postillion
a
queer
upright
little
fellow
with
a
long
pigtail
his
whip
and
clattered
on
while
an
old
forlorn
shepherd
with
a
cocked
hat
gazed
on
us
as
we
passed
the
roads
are
excellent
but
the
heat
was
intense
and
i
suffered
greatly
from
it
we
slept
at
boulogne
the
first
night
where
there
was
an
ugly
but
remarkably
femme
de
chambre
this
made
us
for
the
first
time
remark
the
difference
which
exists
between
this
class
of
persons
in
france
and
in
england
in
the
latter
country
they
are
prudish
and
if
they
become
in
the
least
degree
familiar
they
are
impudent
the
lower
orders
in
france
have
the
easiness
and
politeness
of
the
most
english
they
treat
you
unaffectedly
as
their
equal
and
consequently
there
is
no
scope
for
insolence
we
had
ordered
horses
to
be
ready
during
the
night
but
we
were
too
fatigued
to
make
use
of
them
the
man
insisted
on
being
paid
for
the
whole
post
said
the
pour
de
dommager
les
pauvres
chevaux
perdues
leur
douce
a
joke
from
an
english
would
have
been
quite
another
thing
the
first
appearance
that
struck
our
english
eyes
was
the
want
of
enclosures
but
the
fields
were
flourishing
with
a
plentiful
harvest
we
observed
no
vines
on
this
side
paris
the
weather
still
continued
very
hot
and
travelling
produced
a
very
bad
effect
upon
my
health
my
companions
were
induced
by
this
circumstance
to
hasten
the
journey
as
much
as
possible
and
accordingly
we
did
not
rest
the
following
night
and
the
next
day
about
two
arrived
in
paris
in
this
city
there
are
no
hotels
where
you
can
reside
as
long
or
as
short
a
time
as
you
please
and
we
were
obliged
to
engage
apartments
at
an
hotel
for
a
week
they
were
dear
and
not
very
pleasant
as
usual
in
france
the
principal
apartment
was
a
bedchamber
there
was
another
closet
with
a
bed
and
an
which
we
used
as
a
the
heat
of
the
weather
was
excessive
so
that
we
were
unable
to
walk
except
in
the
afternoon
on
the
first
evening
we
walked
to
the
gardens
of
the
thuilleries
they
are
formal
in
the
french
fashion
the
trees
cut
into
shapes
and
without
grass
i
think
the
boulevards
infinitely
more
pleasant
this
street
nearly
surrounds
paris
and
is
eight
miles
in
extent
it
is
very
wide
and
planted
on
either
side
with
trees
at
one
end
is
a
superb
cascade
which
refreshes
the
senses
by
its
continual
splashing
near
this
stands
the
gate
of
denis
a
beautiful
piece
of
sculpture
i
do
not
know
how
it
may
at
present
be
disfigured
by
the
gothic
barbarism
of
the
conquerors
of
france
who
were
not
contented
with
retaking
the
spoils
of
napoleon
but
with
impotent
malice
destroyed
the
monuments
of
their
own
defeat
when
i
saw
this
gate
it
was
in
its
splendour
and
made
you
imagine
that
the
days
of
roman
greatness
were
transported
to
paris
after
remaining
a
week
in
paris
we
received
a
small
remittance
that
set
us
free
from
a
kind
of
imprisonment
there
which
we
found
very
irksome
but
how
should
we
proceed
after
talking
over
and
rejecting
many
plans
we
fixed
on
one
eccentric
enough
but
which
from
its
romance
was
very
pleasing
to
us
in
england
we
could
not
have
put
it
in
execution
without
sustaining
continual
insult
and
impertinence
the
french
are
far
more
tolerant
of
the
vagaries
of
their
neighbours
we
resolved
to
walk
through
france
but
as
i
was
too
weak
for
any
considerable
distance
and
my
sister
could
not
be
supposed
to
be
able
to
walk
as
far
as
each
day
we
determined
to
purchase
an
ass
to
carry
our
portmanteau
and
one
of
us
by
turns
early
therefore
on
monday
august
and
went
to
the
ass
market
and
purchased
an
ass
and
the
rest
of
the
day
until
four
in
the
afternoon
was
spent
in
preparations
for
our
departure
during
which
madame
paid
us
a
visit
and
attempted
to
dissuade
us
from
our
design
she
represented
to
us
that
a
large
army
had
been
recently
disbanded
that
the
soldiers
and
officers
wandered
idle
about
the
country
and
that
dames
seroient
certainement
but
we
were
proof
against
her
arguments
and
packing
up
a
few
necessaries
leaving
the
rest
to
go
by
the
diligence
we
departed
in
a
fiacre
from
the
door
of
the
hotel
our
little
ass
following
we
dismissed
the
coach
at
the
barrier
it
was
dusk
and
the
ass
seemed
totally
unable
to
bear
one
of
us
appearing
to
sink
under
the
portmanteau
although
it
was
small
and
light
we
were
however
merry
enough
and
thought
the
leagues
short
we
arrived
at
charenton
about
ten
charenton
is
prettily
situated
in
a
valley
through
which
the
seine
flows
winding
among
banks
variegated
with
trees
on
looking
at
this
scene
exclaimed
oh
this
is
beautiful
enough
let
us
live
this
was
her
exclamation
on
every
new
scene
and
as
each
surpassed
the
one
before
she
cried
i
am
glad
we
did
not
stay
at
charenton
but
let
us
live
finding
our
ass
useless
we
sold
it
before
we
proceeded
on
our
journey
and
bought
a
mule
for
ten
napoleons
about
nine
we
departed
we
were
clad
in
black
silk
i
rode
on
the
mule
which
carried
also
our
portmanteau
and
followed
bringing
a
small
basket
of
provisions
at
about
one
we
arrived
at
gros
bois
where
under
the
shade
of
trees
we
ate
our
bread
and
fruit
and
drank
our
wine
thinking
of
don
quixote
and
sancho
the
country
through
which
we
passed
was
highly
cultivated
but
uninteresting
the
horizon
scarcely
ever
extended
beyond
the
circumference
of
a
few
fields
bright
and
waving
with
the
golden
harvest
we
met
several
travellers
but
our
mode
although
novel
did
not
appear
to
excite
any
curiosity
or
remark
this
night
we
slept
at
guignes
in
the
same
room
and
beds
in
which
napoleon
and
some
of
his
generals
had
rested
during
the
late
war
the
little
old
woman
of
the
place
was
highly
gratified
in
having
this
little
story
to
tell
and
spoke
in
warm
praise
of
the
empress
josephine
and
marie
louise
who
had
at
different
times
passed
on
that
road
as
we
continued
our
route
provins
was
the
first
place
that
struck
us
with
interest
it
was
our
stage
of
rest
for
the
night
we
approached
it
at
sunset
after
having
gained
the
summit
of
a
hill
the
prospect
of
the
town
opened
upon
us
as
it
lay
in
the
valley
below
a
rocky
hill
rose
abruptly
on
one
side
on
the
top
of
which
stood
a
ruined
citadel
with
extensive
walls
and
towers
lower
down
but
beyond
was
the
cathedral
and
the
whole
formed
a
scene
for
painting
after
having
travelled
for
two
days
through
a
country
perfectly
without
interest
it
was
a
delicious
relief
for
the
eye
to
dwell
again
on
some
irregularities
and
beauty
of
country
our
fare
at
provins
was
coarse
and
our
beds
uncomfortable
but
the
remembrance
of
this
prospect
made
us
contented
and
happy
we
now
approached
scenes
that
reminded
us
of
what
we
had
nearly
forgotten
that
france
had
lately
been
the
country
in
which
great
and
extraordinary
events
had
taken
place
nogent
a
town
we
entered
about
noon
the
following
day
had
been
entirely
desolated
by
the
cossacs
nothing
could
be
more
entire
than
the
ruin
which
these
barbarians
had
spread
as
they
advanced
perhaps
they
remembered
moscow
and
the
destruction
of
the
russian
villages
but
we
were
now
in
france
and
the
distress
of
the
inhabitants
whose
houses
had
been
burned
their
cattle
killed
and
all
their
wealth
destroyed
has
given
a
sting
to
my
detestation
of
war
which
none
can
feel
who
have
not
travelled
through
a
country
pillaged
and
wasted
by
this
plague
which
in
his
pride
man
inflicts
upon
his
fellow
we
quitted
the
great
route
soon
after
we
had
left
nogent
to
strike
across
the
country
to
troyes
about
six
in
the
evening
we
arrived
at
aubin
a
lovely
village
embosomed
in
trees
but
on
a
nearer
view
we
found
the
cottages
roofless
the
rafters
black
and
the
walls
dilapidated
few
inhabitants
remained
we
asked
for
had
none
to
give
all
their
cows
had
been
taken
by
the
cossacs
we
had
still
some
leagues
to
travel
that
night
but
we
found
that
they
were
not
post
leagues
but
the
measurement
of
the
inhabitants
and
nearly
double
the
distance
the
road
lay
over
a
desart
plain
and
as
night
advanced
we
were
often
in
danger
of
losing
the
track
of
wheels
which
was
our
only
guide
night
closed
in
and
we
suddenly
lost
all
trace
of
the
road
but
a
few
trees
indistinctly
seen
seemed
to
indicate
the
position
of
a
village
about
ten
we
arrived
at
trois
maisons
where
after
a
supper
on
milk
and
sour
bread
we
retired
to
rest
on
wretched
beds
but
sleep
is
seldom
denied
except
to
the
indolent
and
after
the
day
fatigue
although
my
bed
was
nothing
more
than
a
sheet
spread
upon
straw
i
slept
soundly
until
the
morning
was
considerably
advanced
had
hurt
his
ancle
so
considerably
the
preceding
evening
that
he
was
obliged
during
the
whole
of
the
following
day
journey
to
ride
on
our
mule
nothing
could
be
more
barren
and
wretched
than
the
track
through
which
we
now
passed
the
ground
was
chalky
and
uncovered
even
by
grass
and
where
there
had
been
any
attempts
made
towards
cultivation
the
straggling
ears
of
corn
discovered
more
plainly
the
barren
nature
of
the
soil
thousands
of
insects
which
were
of
the
same
white
colour
as
the
road
infested
our
path
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
the
sun
darted
its
rays
upon
us
reflected
back
by
the
earth
until
i
nearly
fainted
under
the
heat
a
village
appeared
at
a
distance
cheering
us
with
a
prospect
of
rest
it
gave
us
new
strength
to
proceed
but
it
was
a
wretched
place
and
afforded
us
but
little
relief
it
had
been
once
large
and
populous
but
now
the
houses
were
roofless
and
the
ruins
that
lay
scattered
about
the
gardens
covered
with
the
white
dust
of
the
torn
cottages
the
black
burnt
beams
and
squalid
looks
of
the
inhabitants
presented
in
every
direction
the
melancholy
aspect
of
devastation
one
house
a
alone
remained
we
were
here
offered
plenty
of
milk
stinking
bacon
sour
bread
and
a
few
vegetables
which
we
were
to
dress
for
ourselves
as
we
prepared
our
dinner
in
a
place
so
filthy
that
the
sight
of
it
alone
was
sufficient
to
destroy
our
appetite
the
people
of
the
village
collected
around
us
squalid
with
dirt
their
countenances
expressing
every
thing
that
is
disgusting
and
brutal
they
seemed
indeed
entirely
detached
from
the
rest
of
the
world
and
ignorant
of
all
that
was
passing
in
it
there
is
much
less
communication
between
the
various
towns
of
france
than
in
england
the
use
of
passports
may
easily
account
for
this
these
people
did
not
know
that
napoleon
was
deposed
and
when
we
asked
why
they
did
not
rebuild
their
cottages
they
replied
that
they
were
afraid
that
the
cossacs
would
destroy
them
again
upon
their
return
echemine
the
name
of
this
village
is
in
every
respect
the
most
disgusting
place
i
ever
met
with
two
leagues
beyond
on
the
same
road
we
came
to
the
village
of
pavillon
so
unlike
echemine
that
we
might
have
fancied
ourselves
in
another
quarter
of
the
globe
here
every
thing
denoted
cleanliness
and
hospitality
many
of
the
cottages
were
destroyed
but
the
inhabitants
were
employed
in
repairing
them
what
could
occasion
so
great
a
difference
still
our
road
lay
over
this
track
of
uncultivated
country
and
our
eyes
were
fatigued
by
observing
nothing
but
a
white
expanse
of
ground
where
no
bramble
or
stunted
shrub
adorned
its
barrenness
towards
evening
we
reached
a
small
plantation
of
vines
it
appeared
like
one
of
those
islands
of
verdure
that
are
met
with
in
the
midst
of
the
sands
of
lybia
but
the
grapes
were
not
yet
ripe
was
totally
incapable
of
walking
and
and
i
were
very
tired
before
we
arrived
at
troyes
we
rested
here
for
the
night
and
devoted
the
following
day
to
a
consideration
of
the
manner
in
which
we
should
proceed
sprain
rendered
our
pedestrianism
impossible
we
accordingly
sold
our
mule
and
bought
an
open
that
went
on
four
wheels
for
five
napoleons
and
hired
a
man
with
a
mule
for
eight
more
to
convey
us
to
neufchâtel
in
six
days
the
suburbs
of
troyes
were
destroyed
and
the
town
itself
dirty
and
uninviting
i
remained
at
the
inn
writing
while
and
arranged
this
bargain
and
visited
the
cathedral
of
the
town
and
the
next
morning
we
departed
in
our
for
neufchâtel
a
curious
instance
of
french
vanity
occurred
on
leaving
this
town
our
pointed
to
the
plain
around
and
mentioned
that
it
had
been
the
scene
of
a
battle
between
the
russians
and
the
french
in
which
the
russians
gained
the
victory
ah
no
madame
replied
the
man
the
french
are
never
but
how
was
it
then
we
asked
that
the
russians
had
entered
troyes
soon
after
oh
after
having
been
defeated
they
took
a
circuitous
route
and
thus
entered
the
vandeuvres
is
a
pleasant
town
at
which
we
rested
during
the
hours
of
noon
we
walked
in
the
grounds
of
a
nobleman
laid
out
in
the
english
taste
and
terminated
in
a
pretty
wood
it
was
a
scene
that
reminded
us
of
our
native
country
as
we
left
vandeuvres
the
aspect
of
the
country
suddenly
changed
abrupt
hills
covered
with
vineyards
intermixed
with
trees
enclosed
a
narrow
valley
the
channel
of
the
aube
the
view
was
interspersed
by
green
meadows
groves
of
poplar
and
white
willow
and
spires
of
village
churches
which
the
cossacs
had
yet
spared
many
villages
ruined
by
the
war
occupied
the
most
romantic
spots
in
the
evening
we
arrived
at
a
beautiful
town
placed
at
the
opening
of
the
vale
where
the
hills
terminate
abruptly
we
climbed
the
highest
of
these
but
scarce
had
we
reached
the
top
when
a
mist
descended
upon
every
thing
and
the
rain
began
to
fall
we
were
wet
through
before
we
could
reach
our
inn
it
was
evening
and
the
laden
clouds
made
the
darkness
almost
as
deep
as
that
of
midnight
but
in
the
west
an
unusually
brilliant
and
fiery
redness
occupied
an
opening
in
the
vapours
and
added
to
the
interest
of
our
little
expedition
the
cottage
lights
were
reflected
in
the
tranquil
river
and
the
dark
hills
behind
dimly
seen
resembled
vast
and
frowning
mountains
as
we
quitted
we
at
the
same
time
bade
a
short
farewell
to
hills
passing
through
the
towns
of
chaumont
langres
which
was
situated
on
a
hill
and
surrounded
by
ancient
fortifications
champlitte
and
gray
we
travelled
for
nearly
three
days
through
plains
where
the
country
gently
undulated
and
relieved
the
eye
from
a
perpetual
flat
without
exciting
any
peculiar
interest
gentle
rivers
their
banks
ornamented
by
a
few
trees
stole
through
these
plains
and
a
thousand
beautiful
summer
insects
skimmed
over
the
streams
the
third
day
was
a
day
of
rain
and
the
first
that
had
taken
place
during
our
journey
we
were
soon
wet
through
and
were
glad
to
stop
at
a
little
inn
to
dry
ourselves
the
reception
we
received
here
was
very
unprepossessing
the
people
still
kept
their
seats
round
the
fire
and
seemed
very
unwilling
to
make
way
for
the
dripping
guests
in
the
afternoon
however
the
weather
became
fine
and
at
about
six
in
the
evening
we
entered
besançon
hills
had
appeared
in
the
distance
during
the
whole
day
and
we
had
advanced
gradually
towards
them
but
were
unprepared
for
the
scene
that
broke
upon
us
as
we
passed
the
gate
of
this
city
on
quitting
the
walls
the
road
wound
underneath
a
high
precipice
on
the
other
side
the
hills
rose
more
gradually
and
the
green
valley
that
intervened
between
them
was
watered
by
a
pleasant
river
before
us
arose
an
amphitheatre
of
hills
covered
with
vines
but
irregular
and
rocky
the
last
gate
of
the
town
was
cut
through
the
precipitous
rock
that
arose
on
one
side
and
in
that
place
jutted
into
the
road
this
approach
to
mountain
scenery
filled
us
with
delight
it
was
otherwise
with
our
he
came
from
the
plains
of
troyes
and
these
hills
so
utterly
scared
him
that
he
in
some
degree
lost
his
reason
after
winding
through
the
valley
we
began
to
ascend
the
mountains
which
were
its
boundary
we
left
our
and
walked
on
delighted
with
every
new
view
that
broke
upon
us
when
we
had
ascended
the
hills
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
we
found
our
at
the
door
of
a
wretched
inn
having
taken
the
mule
from
the
and
obstinately
determined
to
remain
for
the
night
at
this
miserable
village
of
mort
we
could
only
submit
for
he
was
deaf
to
all
we
could
urge
and
to
our
remonstrances
only
replied
ne
puis
our
beds
were
too
uncomfortable
to
allow
a
thought
of
sleeping
in
them
we
could
only
procure
one
room
and
our
hostess
gave
us
to
understand
that
our
was
to
occupy
the
same
apartment
it
was
of
little
consequence
as
we
had
previously
resolved
not
to
enter
the
beds
the
evening
was
fine
and
after
the
rain
the
air
was
perfumed
by
many
delicious
scents
we
climbed
to
a
rocky
seat
on
the
hill
that
overlooked
the
village
where
we
remained
until
sunset
the
night
was
passed
by
the
kitchen
fire
in
a
wretched
manner
striving
to
catch
a
few
moments
of
sleep
which
were
denied
to
us
at
three
in
the
morning
we
pursued
our
journey
our
road
led
to
the
summit
of
the
hills
that
environ
besançon
from
the
top
of
one
of
these
we
saw
the
whole
expanse
of
the
valley
filled
with
a
white
undulating
mist
which
was
pierced
like
islands
by
the
piny
mountains
the
sun
had
just
risen
and
a
ray
of
red
light
lay
upon
the
waves
of
this
fluctuating
vapour
to
the
west
opposite
the
sun
it
seemed
driven
by
the
light
against
the
rocks
in
immense
masses
of
foaming
cloud
until
it
became
lost
in
the
distance
mixing
its
tints
with
the
fleecy
sky
our
insisted
on
remaining
two
hours
at
the
village
of
noè
although
we
were
unable
to
procure
any
dinner
and
wished
to
go
on
to
the
next
stage
i
have
already
said
that
the
hills
scared
his
senses
and
he
had
become
disobliging
sullen
and
stupid
while
he
waited
we
walked
to
the
neighbouring
wood
it
was
a
fine
forest
carpeted
beautifully
with
moss
and
in
various
places
overhung
by
rocks
in
whose
crevices
young
pines
had
taken
root
and
spread
their
branches
for
shade
to
those
below
the
noon
heat
was
intense
and
we
were
glad
to
shelter
ourselves
from
it
in
the
shady
retreats
of
this
lovely
forest
on
our
return
to
the
village
we
found
to
our
extreme
surprise
that
the
had
departed
nearly
an
hour
before
leaving
word
that
he
expected
to
meet
us
on
the
road
sprain
rendered
him
incapable
of
much
exertion
but
there
was
no
remedy
and
we
proceeded
on
foot
to
maison
neuve
an
four
miles
and
a
half
distant
at
maison
neuve
the
man
had
left
word
that
he
should
proceed
to
pontalier
the
frontier
town
of
france
six
leagues
distant
and
that
if
we
did
not
arrive
that
night
he
should
the
next
morning
leave
the
at
an
inn
and
return
with
the
mule
to
troyes
we
were
astonished
at
the
impudence
of
this
message
but
the
boy
of
the
inn
comforted
us
by
saying
that
by
going
on
a
horse
by
a
cross
road
where
the
could
not
venture
he
could
easily
overtake
and
intercept
the
and
accordingly
we
dispatched
him
walking
slowly
after
we
waited
at
the
next
inn
for
dinner
and
in
about
two
hours
the
boy
returned
the
man
promised
to
wait
for
us
at
an
two
leagues
further
on
ancle
had
become
very
painful
but
we
could
procure
no
conveyance
and
as
the
sun
was
nearly
setting
we
were
obliged
to
hasten
on
the
evening
was
most
beautiful
and
the
scenery
lovely
enough
to
beguile
us
of
our
fatigue
the
horned
moon
hung
in
the
light
of
sunset
that
threw
a
glow
of
unusual
depth
of
redness
over
the
piny
mountains
and
the
dark
deep
vallies
they
enclosed
at
intervals
in
the
woods
were
beautiful
lawns
interspersed
with
picturesque
clumps
of
trees
and
dark
pines
overshadowed
our
road
in
about
two
hours
we
arrived
at
the
promised
termination
of
our
journey
but
the
was
not
there
after
the
boy
had
left
him
he
again
pursued
his
journey
towards
pontalier
we
were
enabled
however
to
procure
here
a
rude
kind
of
cart
and
in
this
manner
arrived
late
at
pontalier
where
we
found
our
conductor
who
blundered
out
many
falsehoods
for
excuses
and
thus
ended
the
adventures
of
that
day
switzerland
on
passing
the
french
barrier
a
surprising
difference
may
be
observed
between
the
opposite
nations
that
inhabit
either
side
the
swiss
cottages
are
much
cleaner
and
neater
and
the
inhabitants
exhibit
the
same
contrast
the
swiss
women
wear
a
great
deal
of
white
linen
and
their
whole
dress
is
always
perfectly
clean
this
superior
cleanliness
is
chiefly
produced
by
the
difference
of
religion
travellers
in
germany
remark
the
same
contrast
between
the
protestant
and
catholic
towns
although
they
be
but
a
few
leagues
separate
the
scenery
of
this
day
journey
was
divine
exhibiting
piny
mountains
barren
rocks
and
spots
of
verdure
surpassing
imagination
after
descending
for
nearly
a
league
between
lofty
rocks
covered
with
pines
and
interspersed
with
green
glades
where
the
grass
is
short
and
soft
and
beautifully
verdant
we
arrived
at
the
village
of
sulpice
the
mule
had
latterly
become
very
lame
and
the
man
so
disobliging
that
we
determined
to
engage
a
horse
for
the
remainder
of
the
way
our
had
anticipated
us
without
in
the
least
intimating
his
intention
he
had
determined
to
leave
us
at
this
village
and
taken
measures
to
that
effect
the
man
we
now
engaged
was
a
swiss
a
cottager
of
the
better
class
who
was
proud
of
his
mountains
and
his
country
pointing
to
the
glades
that
were
interspersed
among
the
woods
he
informed
us
that
they
were
very
beautiful
and
were
excellent
pasture
that
the
cows
thrived
there
and
consequently
produced
excellent
milk
from
which
the
best
cheese
and
butter
in
the
world
were
made
the
mountains
after
sulpice
became
loftier
and
more
beautiful
we
passed
through
a
narrow
valley
between
two
ranges
of
mountains
clothed
with
forests
at
the
bottom
of
which
flowed
a
river
from
whose
narrow
bed
on
either
side
the
boundaries
of
the
vale
arose
precipitously
the
road
lay
about
half
way
up
the
mountain
which
formed
one
of
the
sides
and
we
saw
the
overhanging
rocks
above
us
and
below
enormous
pines
and
the
river
not
to
be
perceived
but
from
its
reflection
of
the
light
of
heaven
far
beneath
the
mountains
of
this
beautiful
ravine
are
so
little
asunder
that
in
time
of
war
with
france
an
iron
chain
is
thrown
across
it
two
leagues
from
neufchâtel
we
saw
the
alps
range
after
range
of
black
mountains
are
seen
extending
one
before
the
other
and
far
behind
all
towering
above
every
feature
of
the
scene
the
snowy
alps
they
were
an
hundred
miles
distant
but
reach
so
high
in
the
heavens
that
they
look
like
those
accumulated
clouds
of
dazzling
white
that
arrange
themselves
on
the
horizon
during
summer
their
immensity
staggers
the
imagination
and
so
far
surpasses
all
conception
that
it
requires
an
effort
of
the
understanding
to
believe
that
they
indeed
form
a
part
of
the
earth
from
this
point
we
descended
to
neufchâtel
which
is
situated
in
a
narrow
plain
between
the
mountains
and
its
immense
lake
and
presents
no
additional
aspect
of
peculiar
interest
we
remained
the
following
day
at
this
town
occupied
in
a
consideration
of
the
step
it
would
now
be
advisable
for
us
to
take
the
money
we
had
brought
with
us
from
paris
was
nearly
exhausted
but
we
obtained
about
in
silver
upon
discount
from
one
of
the
bankers
of
the
city
and
with
this
we
resolved
to
journey
towards
the
lake
of
uri
and
seek
in
that
romantic
and
interesting
country
some
cottage
where
we
might
dwell
in
peace
and
solitude
such
were
our
dreams
which
we
should
probably
have
realized
had
it
not
been
for
the
deficiency
of
that
indispensable
article
money
which
obliged
us
to
return
to
england
a
swiss
whom
met
at
the
kindly
interested
himself
in
our
affairs
and
assisted
us
to
hire
a
to
convey
us
to
lucerne
the
principal
town
of
the
lake
of
that
name
which
is
connected
with
the
lake
of
uri
the
journey
to
this
place
occupied
rather
more
than
two
days
the
country
was
flat
and
dull
and
excepting
that
we
now
and
then
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
divine
alps
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
interest
us
lucerne
promised
better
things
and
as
soon
as
we
arrived
august
we
hired
a
boat
with
which
we
proposed
to
coast
the
lake
until
we
should
meet
with
some
suitable
habitation
or
perhaps
even
going
to
altorf
cross
mont
gothard
and
seek
in
the
warm
climate
of
the
country
to
the
south
of
the
alps
an
air
more
salubrious
and
a
temperature
better
fitted
for
the
precarious
state
of
health
than
the
bleak
region
to
the
north
the
lake
of
lucerne
is
encompassed
on
all
sides
by
high
mountains
that
rise
abruptly
from
the
water
their
bare
fronts
descend
perpendicularly
and
cast
a
black
shade
upon
the
waves
they
are
covered
with
thick
wood
whose
dark
foliage
is
interspersed
by
the
brown
bare
crags
on
which
the
trees
have
taken
root
in
every
part
where
a
glade
shews
itself
in
the
forest
it
appears
cultivated
and
cottages
peep
from
among
the
woods
the
most
luxuriant
islands
rocky
and
covered
with
moss
and
bending
trees
are
sprinkled
over
the
lake
most
of
these
are
decorated
by
the
figure
of
a
saint
in
wretched
waxwork
the
direction
of
this
lake
extends
at
first
from
east
to
west
then
turning
a
right
angle
it
lies
from
north
to
south
this
latter
part
is
distinguished
in
name
from
the
other
and
is
called
the
lake
of
uri
the
former
part
is
also
nearly
divided
midway
where
the
jutting
land
almost
meets
and
its
craggy
sides
cast
a
deep
shadow
on
the
little
strait
through
which
you
pass
the
summits
of
several
of
the
mountains
that
enclose
the
lake
to
the
south
are
covered
by
eternal
glaciers
of
one
of
these
opposite
brunen
they
tell
the
story
of
a
priest
and
his
mistress
who
flying
from
persecution
inhabited
a
cottage
at
the
foot
of
the
snows
one
winter
night
an
avalanche
overwhelmed
them
but
their
plaintive
voices
are
still
heard
in
stormy
nights
calling
for
succour
from
the
peasants
brunen
is
situated
on
the
northern
side
of
the
angle
which
the
lake
makes
forming
the
extremity
of
the
lake
of
lucerne
here
we
rested
for
the
night
and
dismissed
our
boatmen
nothing
could
be
more
magnificent
than
the
view
from
this
spot
the
high
mountains
encompassed
us
darkening
the
waters
at
a
distance
on
the
shores
of
uri
we
could
perceive
the
chapel
of
tell
and
this
was
the
village
where
he
matured
the
conspiracy
which
was
to
overthrow
the
tyrant
of
his
country
and
indeed
this
lovely
lake
these
sublime
mountains
and
wild
forests
seemed
a
fit
cradle
for
a
mind
aspiring
to
high
adventure
and
heroic
deeds
yet
we
saw
no
glimpse
of
his
spirit
in
his
present
countrymen
the
swiss
appeared
to
us
then
and
experience
has
confirmed
our
opinion
a
people
slow
of
comprehension
and
of
action
but
habit
has
made
them
unfit
for
slavery
and
they
would
i
have
little
doubt
make
a
brave
defence
against
any
invader
of
their
freedom
such
were
our
reflections
and
we
remained
until
late
in
the
evening
on
the
shores
of
the
lake
conversing
enjoying
the
rising
breeze
and
contemplating
with
feelings
of
exquisite
delight
the
divine
objects
that
surrounded
us
the
following
day
was
spent
in
a
consideration
of
our
circumstances
and
in
contemplation
of
the
scene
around
us
a
furious
south
wind
tore
up
the
lake
making
immense
waves
and
carrying
the
water
in
a
whirlwind
high
in
the
air
when
it
fell
like
heavy
rain
into
the
lake
the
waves
broke
with
a
tremendous
noise
on
the
rocky
shores
this
conflict
continued
during
the
whole
day
but
it
became
calmer
towards
the
evening
and
i
walked
on
the
banks
and
sitting
on
a
rude
pier
read
aloud
the
account
of
the
siege
of
jerusalem
from
tacitus
in
the
mean
time
we
endeavoured
to
find
an
habitation
but
could
only
procure
two
unfurnished
rooms
in
an
ugly
big
house
called
the
chateau
these
we
hired
at
a
guinea
a
month
had
beds
moved
into
them
and
the
next
day
took
possession
but
it
was
a
wretched
place
with
no
comfort
or
convenience
it
was
with
difficulty
that
we
could
get
any
food
prepared
as
it
was
cold
and
rainy
we
ordered
a
lighted
an
immense
stove
which
occupied
a
corner
of
the
room
it
was
long
before
it
heated
and
when
hot
the
warmth
was
so
unwholesome
that
we
were
obliged
to
throw
open
our
windows
to
prevent
a
kind
of
suffocation
added
to
this
there
was
but
one
person
in
brunen
who
could
speak
french
a
barbarous
kind
of
german
being
the
language
of
this
part
of
switzerland
it
was
with
difficulty
therefore
that
we
could
get
our
most
ordinary
wants
supplied
these
immediate
inconveniences
led
us
to
a
more
serious
consideration
of
our
situation
the
which
we
possessed
was
all
the
money
that
we
could
count
upon
with
any
certainty
until
the
following
december
presence
in
london
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
procuring
any
further
supply
what
were
we
to
do
we
should
soon
be
reduced
to
absolute
want
thus
after
balancing
the
various
topics
that
offered
themselves
for
discussion
we
resolved
to
return
to
england
having
formed
this
resolution
we
had
not
a
moment
for
delay
our
little
store
was
sensibly
decreasing
and
could
hardly
appear
sufficient
for
so
long
a
journey
it
had
cost
us
sixty
to
cross
france
from
paris
to
neufchâtel
but
we
now
resolved
on
a
more
economical
mode
of
travelling
water
conveyances
are
always
the
cheapest
and
fortunately
we
were
so
situated
that
by
taking
advantage
of
the
rivers
of
the
reuss
and
rhine
we
could
reach
england
without
travelling
a
league
on
land
this
was
our
plan
we
should
travel
eight
hundred
miles
and
was
this
possible
for
so
small
a
sum
but
there
was
no
other
alternative
and
indeed
only
knew
how
very
little
we
had
to
depend
upon
we
departed
the
next
morning
for
the
town
of
lucerne
it
rained
violently
during
the
first
part
of
our
voyage
but
towards
its
conclusion
the
sky
became
clear
and
the
sunbeams
dried
and
cheered
us
we
saw
again
and
for
the
last
time
the
rocky
shores
of
this
beautiful
lake
its
verdant
isles
and
mountains
we
landed
at
lucerne
and
remained
in
that
town
the
following
night
and
the
next
morning
august
departed
in
the
for
loffenburgh
a
town
on
the
rhine
where
the
falls
of
that
river
prevented
the
same
vessel
from
proceeding
any
further
our
companions
in
this
voyage
were
of
the
meanest
class
smoked
prodigiously
and
were
exceedingly
disgusting
after
having
landed
for
refreshment
in
the
middle
of
the
day
we
found
on
our
return
to
the
boat
that
our
former
seats
were
occupied
we
took
others
when
the
original
possessors
angrily
and
almost
with
violence
insisted
upon
our
leaving
them
their
brutal
rudeness
to
us
who
did
not
understand
their
language
provoked
to
knock
one
of
the
foremost
down
he
did
not
return
the
blow
but
continued
his
vociferations
until
the
boatmen
interfered
and
provided
us
with
other
seats
the
reuss
is
exceedingly
rapid
and
we
descended
several
falls
one
of
more
than
eight
feet
there
is
something
very
delicious
in
the
sensation
when
at
one
moment
you
are
at
the
top
of
a
fall
of
water
and
before
the
second
has
expired
you
are
at
the
bottom
still
rushing
on
with
the
impulse
which
the
descent
has
given
the
waters
of
the
rhone
are
blue
those
of
the
reuss
are
of
a
deep
green
i
should
think
that
there
must
be
something
in
the
beds
of
these
rivers
and
that
the
accidents
of
the
banks
and
sky
can
not
alone
cause
this
difference
sleeping
at
dettingen
we
arrived
the
next
morning
at
loffenburgh
where
we
engaged
a
small
canoe
to
convey
us
to
mumph
i
give
these
boats
this
indian
appellation
as
they
were
of
the
rudest
narrow
and
they
consisted
merely
of
straight
pieces
of
deal
board
unpainted
and
nailed
together
with
so
little
care
that
the
water
constantly
poured
in
at
the
crevices
and
the
boat
perpetually
required
emptying
the
river
was
rapid
and
sped
swiftly
breaking
as
it
passed
on
innumerable
rocks
just
covered
by
the
water
it
was
a
sight
of
some
dread
to
see
our
frail
boat
winding
among
the
eddies
of
the
rocks
which
it
was
death
to
touch
and
when
the
slightest
inclination
on
one
side
would
instantly
have
overset
it
we
could
not
procure
a
boat
at
mumph
and
we
thought
ourselves
lucky
in
meeting
with
a
return
to
rheinfelden
but
our
good
fortune
was
of
short
duration
about
a
league
from
mumph
the
broke
down
and
we
were
obliged
to
proceed
on
foot
fortunately
we
were
overtaken
by
some
swiss
soldiers
who
were
discharged
and
returning
home
who
carried
our
box
for
us
as
far
as
rheinfelden
when
we
were
directed
to
proceed
a
league
farther
to
a
village
where
boats
were
commonly
hired
here
although
not
without
some
difficulty
we
procured
a
boat
for
basle
and
proceeded
down
a
swift
river
while
evening
came
on
and
the
air
was
bleak
and
comfortless
our
voyage
was
however
short
and
we
arrived
at
the
place
of
our
destination
by
six
in
the
evening
germany
before
we
slept
had
made
a
bargain
for
a
boat
to
carry
us
to
mayence
and
the
next
morning
bidding
adieu
to
switzerland
we
embarked
in
a
boat
laden
with
merchandize
but
where
we
had
no
to
disturb
our
tranquillity
by
their
vulgarity
and
rudeness
the
wind
was
violently
against
us
but
the
stream
aided
by
a
slight
exertion
from
the
rowers
carried
us
on
the
sun
shone
pleasantly
read
aloud
to
us
mary
wollstonecraft
letters
from
norway
and
we
passed
our
time
delightfully
the
evening
was
such
as
to
find
few
parallels
in
beauty
as
it
approached
the
banks
which
had
hitherto
been
flat
and
uninteresting
became
exceedingly
beautiful
suddenly
the
river
grew
narrow
and
the
boat
dashed
with
inconceivable
rapidity
round
the
base
of
a
rocky
hill
covered
with
pines
a
ruined
tower
with
its
desolated
windows
stood
on
the
summit
of
another
hill
that
jutted
into
the
river
beyond
the
sunset
was
illuminating
the
distant
mountains
and
clouds
casting
the
reflection
of
its
rich
and
purple
hues
on
the
agitated
river
the
brilliance
and
contrasts
of
the
colours
on
the
circling
whirlpools
of
the
stream
was
an
appearance
entirely
new
and
most
beautiful
the
shades
grew
darker
as
the
sun
descended
below
the
horizon
and
after
we
had
landed
as
we
walked
to
our
inn
round
a
beautiful
bay
the
full
moon
arose
with
divine
splendour
casting
its
silver
light
on
the
waves
the
following
morning
we
pursued
our
journey
in
a
slight
canoe
in
which
every
motion
was
accompanied
with
danger
but
the
stream
had
lost
much
of
its
rapidity
and
was
no
longer
impeded
by
rocks
the
banks
were
low
and
covered
with
willows
we
passed
strasburgh
and
the
next
morning
it
was
proposed
to
us
that
we
should
proceed
in
the
as
the
navigation
would
become
dangerous
for
our
small
boat
there
were
only
four
passengers
besides
ourselves
three
of
these
were
students
of
the
strasburgh
university
schwitz
a
rather
handsome
good
tempered
young
man
hoff
a
kind
of
shapeless
animal
with
a
heavy
ugly
german
face
and
schneider
who
was
nearly
an
ideot
and
on
whom
his
companions
were
always
playing
a
thousand
tricks
the
remaining
passengers
were
a
woman
and
an
infant
the
country
was
uninteresting
but
we
enjoyed
fine
weather
and
slept
in
the
boat
in
the
open
air
without
any
inconvenience
we
saw
on
the
shores
few
objects
that
called
forth
our
attention
if
i
except
the
town
of
manheim
which
was
strikingly
neat
and
clean
it
was
situated
at
about
a
mile
from
the
river
and
the
road
to
it
was
planted
on
each
side
with
beautiful
acacias
the
last
part
of
this
voyage
was
performed
close
under
land
as
the
wind
was
so
violently
against
us
that
even
with
all
the
force
of
a
rapid
current
in
our
favour
we
were
hardly
permitted
to
proceed
we
were
told
and
not
without
reason
that
we
ought
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
having
exchanged
our
canoe
for
this
boat
as
the
river
was
now
of
considerable
width
and
tossed
by
the
wind
into
large
waves
the
same
morning
a
boat
containing
fifteen
persons
in
attempting
to
cross
the
water
had
upset
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
every
one
in
it
perished
we
saw
the
boat
turned
over
floating
down
the
stream
this
was
a
melancholy
sight
yet
ludicrously
commented
on
by
the
almost
the
whole
stock
of
whose
french
consisted
in
the
word
when
we
asked
him
what
had
happened
he
answered
laying
particular
emphasis
on
this
favourite
dissyllable
seulement
un
bateau
qui
etoit
seulement
renversèe
et
tous
les
peuples
sont
seulement
mayence
is
one
of
the
best
fortified
towns
in
germany
the
river
which
is
broad
and
rapid
guards
it
to
the
east
and
the
hills
for
three
leagues
around
exhibit
signs
of
fortifications
the
town
itself
is
old
the
streets
narrow
and
the
houses
high
the
cathedral
and
towers
of
the
town
still
bear
marks
of
the
bombardment
which
took
place
in
the
revolutionary
war
we
took
our
place
in
the
for
cologne
and
the
next
morning
september
departed
this
conveyance
appeared
much
more
like
a
mercantile
english
affair
than
any
we
had
before
seen
it
was
shaped
like
a
with
a
cabin
and
a
high
deck
most
of
our
companions
chose
to
remain
in
the
cabin
this
was
fortunate
for
us
since
nothing
could
be
more
horribly
disgusting
than
the
lower
order
of
smoking
drinking
germans
who
travelled
with
us
they
swaggered
and
talked
and
what
was
hideous
to
english
eyes
kissed
one
another
there
were
however
two
or
three
merchants
of
a
better
class
who
appeared
and
polite
the
part
of
the
rhine
down
which
we
now
glided
is
that
so
beautifully
described
by
lord
byron
in
his
third
canto
of
we
read
these
verses
with
delight
as
they
conjured
before
us
these
lovely
scenes
with
the
truth
and
vividness
of
painting
and
with
the
exquisite
addition
of
glowing
language
and
a
warm
imagination
we
were
carried
down
by
a
dangerously
rapid
current
and
saw
on
either
side
of
us
hills
covered
with
vines
and
trees
craggy
cliffs
crowned
by
desolate
towers
and
wooded
islands
where
picturesque
ruins
peeped
from
behind
the
foliage
and
cast
the
shadows
of
their
forms
on
the
troubled
waters
which
distorted
without
deforming
them
we
heard
the
songs
of
the
vintagers
and
if
surrounded
by
disgusting
germans
the
sight
was
not
so
replete
with
enjoyment
as
i
now
fancy
it
to
have
been
yet
memory
taking
all
the
dark
shades
from
the
picture
presents
this
part
of
the
rhine
to
my
remembrance
as
the
loveliest
paradise
on
earth
we
had
sufficient
leisure
for
the
enjoyment
of
these
scenes
for
the
boatmen
neither
rowing
nor
steering
suffered
us
to
be
carried
down
by
the
stream
and
the
boat
turned
round
and
round
as
it
descended
while
i
speak
with
disgust
of
the
germans
who
travelled
with
us
i
should
in
justice
to
these
borderers
record
that
at
one
of
the
inns
here
we
saw
the
only
pretty
woman
we
met
with
in
the
course
of
our
travels
she
is
what
i
should
conceive
to
be
a
truly
german
beauty
grey
eyes
slightly
tinged
with
brown
and
expressive
of
uncommon
sweetness
and
frankness
she
had
lately
recovered
from
a
fever
and
this
added
to
the
interest
of
her
countenance
by
adorning
it
with
an
appearance
of
extreme
delicacy
on
the
following
day
we
left
the
hills
of
the
rhine
and
found
that
for
the
remainder
of
our
journey
we
should
move
sluggishly
through
the
flats
of
holland
the
river
also
winds
extremely
so
that
after
calculating
our
resources
we
resolved
to
finish
our
journey
in
a
land
diligence
our
water
conveyance
remained
that
night
at
bonn
and
that
we
might
lose
no
time
we
proceeded
post
the
same
night
to
cologne
where
we
arrived
late
for
the
rate
of
travelling
in
germany
seldom
exceeds
a
mile
and
a
half
an
hour
cologne
appeared
an
immense
town
as
we
drove
through
street
after
street
to
arrive
at
our
inn
before
we
slept
we
secured
places
in
the
diligence
which
was
to
depart
next
morning
for
clêves
nothing
in
the
world
can
be
more
wretched
than
travelling
in
this
german
diligence
the
coach
is
clumsy
and
comfortless
and
we
proceeded
so
slowly
stopping
so
often
that
it
appeared
as
if
we
should
never
arrive
at
our
journey
end
we
were
allowed
two
hours
for
dinner
and
two
more
were
wasted
in
the
evening
while
the
coach
was
being
changed
we
were
then
requested
as
the
diligence
had
a
greater
demand
for
places
than
it
could
supply
to
proceed
in
a
which
was
provided
for
us
we
readily
consented
as
we
hoped
to
travel
faster
than
in
the
heavy
diligence
but
this
was
not
permitted
and
we
jogged
on
all
night
behind
this
cumbrous
machine
in
the
morning
when
we
stopped
and
for
a
moment
indulged
a
hope
that
we
had
arrived
at
clêves
which
was
at
the
distance
of
five
leagues
from
our
last
night
stage
but
we
had
only
advanced
three
leagues
in
seven
or
eight
hours
and
had
yet
eight
miles
to
perform
however
we
first
rested
about
three
hours
at
this
stage
where
we
could
not
obtain
breakfast
or
any
convenience
and
at
about
eight
we
again
departed
and
with
slow
although
far
from
easy
travelling
faint
with
hunger
and
fatigue
we
arrived
by
noon
at
clêves
holland
tired
by
the
slow
pace
of
the
diligence
we
resolved
to
post
the
remainder
of
the
way
we
had
now
however
left
germany
and
travelled
at
about
the
same
rate
as
an
english
the
country
was
entirely
flat
and
the
roads
so
sandy
that
the
horses
proceeded
with
difficulty
the
only
ornaments
of
this
country
are
the
turf
fortifications
that
surround
the
towns
at
nimeguen
we
passed
the
flying
bridge
mentioned
in
the
letters
of
lady
mary
montague
we
had
intended
to
travel
all
night
but
at
triel
where
we
arrived
at
about
ten
we
were
assured
that
no
was
to
be
found
who
would
proceed
at
so
late
an
hour
on
account
of
the
robbers
who
infested
the
roads
this
was
an
obvious
imposition
but
as
we
could
procure
neither
horses
nor
driver
we
were
obliged
to
sleep
here
during
the
whole
of
the
following
day
the
road
lay
between
canals
which
intersect
this
country
in
every
direction
the
roads
were
excellent
but
the
dutch
have
contrived
as
many
inconveniences
as
possible
in
our
journey
of
the
day
before
we
had
passed
by
a
windmill
which
was
so
situated
with
regard
to
the
road
that
it
was
only
by
keeping
close
to
the
opposite
side
and
passing
quickly
that
we
could
avoid
the
sweep
of
its
sails
the
roads
between
the
canals
were
only
wide
enough
to
admit
of
one
carriage
so
that
when
we
encountered
another
we
were
obliged
sometimes
to
back
for
half
a
mile
until
we
should
come
to
one
of
the
drawbridges
which
led
to
the
fields
on
which
one
of
the
was
rolled
while
the
other
passed
but
they
have
another
practice
which
is
still
more
annoying
the
flax
when
cut
is
put
to
soak
under
the
mud
of
the
canals
and
then
placed
to
dry
against
the
trees
which
are
planted
on
either
side
of
the
road
the
stench
that
it
exhales
when
the
beams
of
the
sun
draw
out
the
moisture
is
scarcely
endurable
we
saw
many
enormous
frogs
and
toads
in
the
canals
and
the
only
sight
which
refreshed
the
eye
by
its
beauty
was
the
delicious
verdure
of
the
fields
where
the
grass
was
as
rich
and
green
as
that
of
england
an
appearance
not
common
on
the
continent
rotterdam
is
remarkably
clean
the
dutch
even
wash
the
outside
brickwork
of
their
houses
we
remained
here
one
day
and
met
with
a
man
in
a
very
unfortunate
condition
he
had
been
born
in
holland
and
had
spent
so
much
of
his
life
between
england
france
and
germany
that
he
had
acquired
a
slight
knowledge
of
the
language
of
each
country
and
spoke
all
very
imperfectly
he
said
that
he
understood
english
best
but
he
was
nearly
unable
to
express
himself
in
that
on
the
evening
of
the
of
august
we
sailed
from
rotterdam
but
contrary
winds
obliged
us
to
remain
nearly
two
days
at
marsluys
a
town
about
two
leagues
from
rotterdam
here
our
last
guinea
was
expended
and
we
reflected
with
wonder
that
we
had
travelled
eight
hundred
miles
for
less
than
thirty
pounds
passing
through
lovely
scenes
and
enjoying
the
beauteous
rhine
and
all
the
brilliant
shews
of
earth
and
sky
perhaps
more
travelling
as
we
did
in
an
open
boat
than
if
we
had
been
shut
up
in
a
carriage
and
passed
on
the
road
under
the
hills
the
captain
of
our
vessel
was
an
englishman
and
had
been
a
pilot
the
bar
of
the
rhine
a
little
below
marsluys
is
so
dangerous
that
without
a
very
favourable
breeze
none
of
the
dutch
vessels
dare
attempt
its
passage
but
although
the
wind
was
a
very
few
points
in
our
favour
our
captain
resolved
to
sail
and
although
half
repentant
before
he
had
accomplished
his
undertaking
he
was
glad
and
proud
when
triumphing
over
the
timorous
dutchmen
the
bar
was
crossed
and
the
vessel
safe
in
the
open
sea
it
was
in
truth
an
enterprise
of
some
peril
a
heavy
gale
had
prevailed
during
the
night
and
although
it
had
abated
since
the
morning
the
breakers
at
the
bar
were
still
exceedingly
high
through
some
delay
which
had
arisen
from
the
ship
having
got
in
the
harbour
we
arrived
half
an
hour
after
the
appointed
time
the
breakers
were
tremendous
and
we
were
informed
that
there
was
the
space
of
only
two
feet
between
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
and
the
sands
the
waves
which
broke
against
the
sides
of
the
ship
with
a
terrible
shock
were
quite
perpendicular
and
even
sometimes
overhanging
in
the
abrupt
smoothness
of
their
sides
shoals
of
enormous
porpoises
were
sporting
with
the
utmost
composure
amidst
the
troubled
waters
we
safely
past
this
danger
and
after
a
navigation
unexpectedly
short
arrived
at
gravesend
on
the
morning
of
the
of
september
the
third

may
we
arrived
at
paris
on
the
of
this
month
and
were
detained
two
days
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
various
signatures
necessary
to
our
passports
the
french
government
having
become
much
more
circumspect
since
the
escape
of
lavalette
we
had
no
letters
of
introduction
or
any
friend
in
that
city
and
were
therefore
confined
to
our
hotel
where
we
were
obliged
to
hire
apartments
for
the
week
although
when
we
first
arrived
we
expected
to
be
detained
one
night
only
for
in
paris
there
are
no
houses
where
you
can
be
accommodated
with
apartments
by
the
day
the
manners
of
the
french
are
interesting
although
less
attractive
at
least
to
englishmen
than
before
the
last
invasion
of
the
allies
the
discontent
and
sullenness
of
their
minds
perpetually
betrays
itself
nor
is
it
wonderful
that
they
should
regard
the
subjects
of
a
government
which
fills
their
country
with
hostile
garrisons
and
sustains
a
detested
dynasty
on
the
throne
with
an
acrimony
and
indignation
of
which
that
government
alone
is
the
proper
object
this
feeling
is
honourable
to
the
french
and
encouraging
to
all
those
of
every
nation
in
europe
who
have
a
fellow
feeling
with
the
oppressed
and
who
cherish
an
unconquerable
hope
that
the
cause
of
liberty
must
at
length
prevail
our
route
after
paris
as
far
as
troyes
lay
through
the
same
uninteresting
tract
of
country
which
we
had
traversed
on
foot
nearly
two
years
before
but
on
quitting
troyes
we
left
the
road
leading
to
neufchâtel
to
follow
that
which
was
to
conduct
us
to
geneva
we
entered
dijon
on
the
third
evening
after
our
departure
from
paris
and
passing
through
dôle
arrived
at
poligny
this
town
is
built
at
the
foot
of
jura
which
rises
abruptly
from
a
plain
of
vast
extent
the
rocks
of
the
mountain
overhang
the
houses
some
difficulty
in
procuring
horses
detained
us
here
until
the
evening
closed
in
when
we
proceeded
by
the
light
of
a
stormy
moon
to
champagnolles
a
little
village
situated
in
the
depth
of
the
mountains
the
road
was
serpentine
and
exceedingly
steep
and
was
overhung
on
one
side
by
half
distinguished
precipices
whilst
the
other
was
a
gulph
filled
by
the
darkness
of
the
driving
clouds
the
dashing
of
the
invisible
mountain
streams
announced
to
us
that
we
had
quitted
the
plains
of
france
as
we
slowly
ascended
amidst
a
violent
storm
of
wind
and
rain
to
champagnolles
where
we
arrived
at
twelve
the
fourth
night
after
our
departure
from
paris
the
next
morning
we
proceeded
still
ascending
among
the
ravines
and
vallies
of
the
mountain
the
scenery
perpetually
grows
more
wonderful
and
sublime
pine
forests
of
impenetrable
thickness
and
untrodden
nay
inaccessible
expanse
spread
on
every
side
sometimes
the
dark
woods
descending
follow
the
route
into
the
vallies
the
distorted
trees
struggling
with
knotted
roots
between
the
most
barren
clefts
sometimes
the
road
winds
high
into
the
regions
of
frost
and
then
the
forests
become
scattered
and
the
branches
of
the
trees
are
loaded
with
snow
and
half
of
the
enormous
pines
themselves
buried
in
the
wavy
drifts
the
spring
as
the
inhabitants
informed
us
was
unusually
late
and
indeed
the
cold
was
excessive
as
we
ascended
the
mountains
the
same
clouds
which
rained
on
us
in
the
vallies
poured
forth
large
flakes
of
snow
thick
and
fast
the
sun
occasionally
shone
through
these
showers
and
illuminated
the
magnificent
ravines
of
the
mountains
whose
gigantic
pines
were
some
laden
with
snow
some
wreathed
round
by
the
lines
of
scattered
and
lingering
vapour
others
darting
their
dark
spires
into
the
sunny
sky
brilliantly
clear
and
azure
as
the
evening
advanced
and
we
ascended
higher
the
snow
which
we
had
beheld
whitening
the
overhanging
rocks
now
encroached
upon
our
road
and
it
snowed
fast
as
we
entered
the
village
of
les
rousses
where
we
were
threatened
by
the
apparent
necessity
of
passing
the
night
in
a
bad
inn
and
dirty
beds
for
from
that
place
there
are
two
roads
to
geneva
one
by
nion
in
the
swiss
territory
where
the
mountain
route
is
shorter
and
comparatively
easy
at
that
time
of
the
year
when
the
road
is
for
several
leagues
covered
with
snow
of
an
enormous
depth
the
other
road
lay
through
gex
and
was
too
circuitous
and
dangerous
to
be
attempted
at
so
late
an
hour
in
the
day
our
passport
however
was
for
gex
and
we
were
told
that
we
could
not
change
its
destination
but
all
these
police
laws
so
severe
in
themselves
are
to
be
softened
by
bribery
and
this
difficulty
was
at
length
overcome
we
hired
four
horses
and
ten
men
to
support
the
carriage
and
departed
from
les
rousses
at
six
in
the
evening
when
the
sun
had
already
far
descended
and
the
snow
pelting
against
the
windows
of
our
carriage
assisted
the
coming
darkness
to
deprive
us
of
the
view
of
the
lake
of
geneva
and
the
far
distant
alps
the
prospect
around
however
was
sufficiently
sublime
to
command
our
was
scene
more
awfully
desolate
the
trees
in
these
regions
are
incredibly
large
and
stand
in
scattered
clumps
over
the
white
wilderness
the
vast
expanse
of
snow
was
chequered
only
by
these
gigantic
pines
and
the
poles
that
marked
our
road
no
river
or
lawn
relieved
the
eye
by
adding
the
picturesque
to
the
sublime
the
natural
silence
of
that
uninhabited
desert
contrasted
strangely
with
the
voices
of
the
men
who
conducted
us
who
with
animated
tones
and
gestures
called
to
one
another
in
a
composed
of
french
and
italian
creating
disturbance
where
but
for
them
there
was
none
to
what
a
different
scene
are
we
now
arrived
to
the
warm
sunshine
and
to
the
humming
of
insects
from
the
windows
of
our
hotel
we
see
the
lovely
lake
blue
as
the
heavens
which
it
reflects
and
sparkling
with
golden
beams
the
opposite
shore
is
sloping
and
covered
with
vines
which
however
do
not
so
early
in
the
season
add
to
the
beauty
of
the
prospect
gentlemens
seats
are
scattered
over
these
banks
behind
which
rise
the
various
ridges
of
black
mountains
and
towering
far
above
in
the
midst
of
its
snowy
alps
the
majestic
mont
blanc
highest
and
queen
of
all
such
is
the
view
reflected
by
the
lake
it
is
a
bright
summer
scene
without
any
of
that
sacred
solitude
and
deep
seclusion
that
delighted
us
at
lucerne
we
have
not
yet
found
out
any
very
agreeable
walks
but
you
know
our
attachment
to
water
excursions
we
have
hired
a
boat
and
every
evening
at
about
six
we
sail
on
the
lake
which
is
delightful
whether
we
glide
over
a
glassy
surface
or
are
speeded
along
by
a
strong
wind
the
waves
of
this
lake
never
afflict
me
with
that
sickness
that
deprives
me
of
all
enjoyment
in
a
sea
voyage
on
the
contrary
the
tossing
of
our
boat
raises
my
spirits
and
inspires
me
with
unusual
hilarity
twilight
here
is
of
short
duration
but
we
at
present
enjoy
the
benefit
of
an
increasing
moon
and
seldom
return
until
ten
when
as
we
approach
the
shore
we
are
saluted
by
the
delightful
scent
of
flowers
and
new
mown
grass
and
the
chirp
of
the
grasshoppers
and
the
song
of
the
evening
birds
we
do
not
enter
into
society
here
yet
our
time
passes
swiftly
and
delightfully
we
read
latin
and
italian
during
the
heats
of
noon
and
when
the
sun
declines
we
walk
in
the
garden
of
the
hotel
looking
at
the
rabbits
relieving
fallen
cockchafers
and
watching
the
motions
of
a
myriad
of
lizards
who
inhabit
a
southern
wall
of
the
garden
you
know
that
we
have
just
escaped
from
the
gloom
of
winter
and
of
london
and
coming
to
this
delightful
spot
during
this
divine
weather
i
feel
as
happy
as
a
bird
and
hardly
care
what
twig
i
fly
to
so
that
i
may
try
my
wings
a
more
experienced
bird
may
be
more
difficult
in
its
choice
of
a
bower
but
in
my
present
temper
of
mind
the
budding
flowers
the
fresh
grass
of
spring
and
the
happy
creatures
about
me
that
live
and
enjoy
these
pleasures
are
quite
enough
to
afford
me
exquisite
delight
even
though
clouds
should
shut
out
mont
blanc
from
my
sight
adieu
letter
ii
campagne
near
coligny
june
you
will
perceive
from
my
date
that
we
have
changed
our
residence
since
my
last
letter
we
now
inhabit
a
little
cottage
on
the
opposite
shore
of
the
lake
and
have
exchanged
the
view
of
mont
blanc
and
her
snowy
for
the
dark
frowning
jura
behind
whose
range
we
every
evening
see
the
sun
sink
and
darkness
approaches
our
valley
from
behind
the
alps
which
are
then
tinged
by
that
glowing
hue
which
is
observed
in
england
to
attend
on
the
clouds
of
an
autumnal
sky
when
is
almost
gone
the
lake
is
at
our
feet
and
a
little
harbour
contains
our
boat
in
which
we
still
enjoy
our
evening
excursions
on
the
water
unfortunately
we
do
not
now
enjoy
those
brilliant
skies
that
hailed
us
on
our
first
arrival
to
this
country
an
almost
perpetual
rain
confines
us
principally
to
the
house
but
when
the
sun
bursts
forth
it
is
with
a
splendour
and
heat
unknown
in
england
the
thunder
storms
that
visit
us
are
grander
and
more
terrific
than
i
have
ever
seen
before
we
watch
them
as
they
approach
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
observing
the
lightning
play
among
the
clouds
in
various
parts
of
the
heavens
and
dart
in
jagged
figures
upon
the
piny
heights
of
jura
dark
with
the
shadow
of
the
overhanging
cloud
while
perhaps
the
sun
is
shining
cheerily
upon
us
one
night
we
a
finer
storm
than
i
had
ever
before
beheld
the
lake
was
lit
pines
on
jura
made
visible
and
all
the
scene
illuminated
for
an
instant
when
a
pitchy
blackness
succeeded
and
the
thunder
came
in
frightful
bursts
over
our
heads
amid
the
darkness
but
while
i
still
dwell
on
the
country
around
geneva
you
will
expect
me
to
say
something
of
the
town
itself
there
is
nothing
however
in
it
that
can
repay
you
for
the
trouble
of
walking
over
its
rough
stones
the
houses
are
high
the
streets
narrow
many
of
them
on
the
ascent
and
no
public
building
of
any
beauty
to
attract
your
eye
or
any
architecture
to
gratify
your
taste
the
town
is
surrounded
by
a
wall
the
three
gates
of
which
are
shut
exactly
at
ten
when
no
bribery
as
in
france
can
open
them
to
the
south
of
the
town
is
the
promenade
of
the
genevese
a
grassy
plain
planted
with
a
few
trees
and
called
plainpalais
here
a
small
obelisk
is
erected
to
the
glory
of
rousseau
and
here
such
is
the
mutability
of
human
life
the
magistrates
the
successors
of
those
who
exiled
him
from
his
native
country
were
shot
by
the
populace
during
that
revolution
which
his
writings
mainly
contributed
to
mature
and
which
notwithstanding
the
temporary
bloodshed
and
injustice
with
which
it
was
polluted
has
produced
enduring
benefits
to
mankind
which
all
the
chicanery
of
statesmen
nor
even
the
great
conspiracy
of
kings
can
entirely
render
vain
from
respect
to
the
memory
of
their
predecessors
none
of
the
present
magistrates
ever
walk
in
plainpalais
another
sunday
recreation
for
the
citizens
is
an
excursion
to
the
top
of
mont
salève
this
hill
is
within
a
league
of
the
town
and
rises
perpendicularly
from
the
cultivated
plain
it
is
ascended
on
the
other
side
and
i
should
judge
from
its
situation
that
your
toil
is
rewarded
by
a
delightful
view
of
the
course
of
the
rhone
and
arve
and
of
the
shores
of
the
lake
we
have
not
yet
visited
it
there
is
more
equality
of
classes
here
than
in
england
this
occasions
a
greater
freedom
and
refinement
of
manners
among
the
lower
orders
than
we
meet
with
in
our
own
country
i
fancy
the
haughty
english
ladies
are
greatly
disgusted
with
this
consequence
of
republican
institutions
for
the
genevese
servants
complain
very
much
of
their
an
exercise
of
the
tongue
i
believe
perfectly
unknown
here
the
peasants
of
switzerland
may
not
however
emulate
the
vivacity
and
grace
of
the
french
they
are
more
cleanly
but
they
are
slow
and
inapt
i
know
a
girl
of
twenty
who
although
she
had
lived
all
her
life
among
vineyards
could
not
inform
me
during
what
month
the
vintage
took
place
and
i
discovered
she
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
order
in
which
the
months
succeed
to
one
another
she
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
i
had
talked
of
the
burning
sun
and
delicious
fruits
of
december
or
of
the
frosts
of
july
yet
she
is
by
no
means
deficient
in
understanding
the
genevese
are
also
much
inclined
to
puritanism
it
is
true
that
from
habit
they
dance
on
a
sunday
but
as
soon
as
the
french
government
was
abolished
in
the
town
the
magistrates
ordered
the
theatre
to
be
closed
and
measures
were
taken
to
pull
down
the
building
we
have
latterly
enjoyed
fine
weather
and
nothing
is
more
pleasant
than
to
listen
to
the
evening
song
of
the
they
are
all
women
and
most
of
them
have
harmonious
although
masculine
voices
the
theme
of
their
ballads
consists
of
shepherds
love
flocks
and
the
sons
of
kings
who
fall
in
love
with
beautiful
shepherdesses
their
tunes
are
monotonous
but
it
is
sweet
to
hear
them
in
the
stillness
of
evening
while
we
are
enjoying
the
sight
of
the
setting
sun
either
from
the
hill
behind
our
house
or
from
the
lake
such
are
our
pleasures
here
which
would
be
greatly
increased
if
the
season
had
been
more
favourable
for
they
chiefly
consist
in
such
enjoyments
as
sunshine
and
gentle
breezes
bestow
we
have
not
yet
made
any
excursion
in
the
environs
of
the
town
but
we
have
planned
several
when
you
shall
again
hear
of
us
and
we
will
endeavour
by
the
magic
of
words
to
transport
the
ethereal
part
of
you
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
alps
and
mountain
streams
and
forests
which
while
they
clothe
the
former
darken
the
latter
with
their
vast
shadows
adieu
letter
iii
to
esq
montalegre
near
coligni
geneva
july
it
is
nearly
a
fortnight
since
i
have
returned
from
vevai
this
journey
has
been
on
every
account
delightful
but
most
especially
because
then
i
first
knew
the
divine
beauty
of
rousseau
imagination
as
it
exhibits
itself
in
julie
it
is
inconceivable
what
an
enchantment
the
scene
itself
lends
to
those
delineations
from
which
its
own
most
touching
charm
arises
but
i
will
give
you
an
abstract
of
our
voyage
which
lasted
eight
days
and
if
you
have
a
map
of
switzerland
you
can
follow
me
we
left
montalegre
at
half
past
two
on
the
of
june
the
lake
was
calm
and
after
three
hours
of
rowing
we
arrived
at
hermance
a
beautiful
little
village
containing
a
ruined
tower
built
the
villagers
say
by
julius
cæsar
there
were
three
other
towers
similar
to
it
which
the
genevese
destroyed
for
their
own
fortifications
in
we
got
into
the
tower
by
a
kind
of
window
the
walls
are
immensely
solid
and
the
stone
of
which
it
is
built
so
hard
that
it
yet
retained
the
mark
of
chisels
the
boatmen
said
that
this
tower
was
once
three
times
higher
than
it
is
now
there
are
two
staircases
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
one
of
which
is
entirely
demolished
and
the
other
half
ruined
and
only
accessible
by
a
ladder
the
town
itself
now
an
inconsiderable
village
inhabited
by
a
few
fishermen
was
built
by
a
queen
of
burgundy
and
reduced
to
its
present
state
by
the
inhabitants
of
berne
who
burnt
and
ravaged
every
thing
they
could
find
leaving
hermance
we
arrived
at
sunset
at
the
village
of
nerni
after
looking
at
our
lodgings
which
were
gloomy
and
dirty
we
walked
out
by
the
side
of
the
lake
it
was
beautiful
to
see
the
vast
expanse
of
these
purple
and
misty
waters
broken
by
the
craggy
islets
near
to
its
slant
and
beached
there
were
many
fish
sporting
in
the
lake
and
multitudes
were
collected
close
to
the
rocks
to
catch
the
flies
which
inhabited
them
on
returning
to
the
village
we
sat
on
a
wall
beside
the
lake
looking
at
some
children
who
were
playing
at
a
game
like
ninepins
the
children
here
appeared
in
an
extraordinary
way
deformed
and
diseased
most
of
them
were
crooked
and
with
enlarged
throats
but
one
little
boy
had
such
exquisite
grace
in
his
mien
and
motions
as
i
never
before
saw
equalled
in
a
child
his
countenance
was
beautiful
for
the
expression
with
which
it
overflowed
there
was
a
mixture
of
pride
and
gentleness
in
his
eyes
and
lips
the
indications
of
sensibility
which
his
education
will
probably
pervert
to
misery
or
seduce
to
crime
but
there
was
more
of
gentleness
than
of
pride
and
it
seemed
that
the
pride
was
tamed
from
its
original
wildness
by
the
habitual
exercise
of
milder
feelings
my
companion
gave
him
a
piece
of
money
which
he
took
without
speaking
with
a
sweet
smile
of
easy
thankfulness
and
then
with
an
unembarrassed
air
turned
to
his
play
all
this
might
scarcely
be
but
the
imagination
surely
could
not
forbear
to
breathe
into
the
most
inanimate
forms
some
likeness
of
its
own
visions
on
such
a
serene
and
glowing
evening
in
this
remote
and
romantic
village
beside
the
calm
lake
that
bore
us
hither
on
returning
to
our
inn
we
found
that
the
servant
had
arranged
our
rooms
and
deprived
them
of
the
greater
portion
of
their
former
disconsolate
appearance
they
reminded
my
companion
of
greece
it
was
five
years
he
said
since
he
had
slept
in
such
beds
the
influence
of
the
recollections
excited
by
this
circumstance
on
our
conversation
gradually
faded
and
i
retired
to
rest
with
no
unpleasant
sensations
thinking
of
our
journey
tomorrow
and
of
the
pleasure
of
recounting
the
little
adventures
of
it
when
we
return
the
next
morning
we
passed
yvoire
a
scattered
village
with
an
ancient
castle
whose
houses
are
interspersed
with
trees
and
which
stands
at
a
little
distance
from
nerni
on
the
promontory
which
bounds
a
deep
bay
some
miles
in
extent
so
soon
as
we
arrived
at
this
promontory
the
lake
began
to
assume
an
aspect
of
wilder
magnificence
the
mountains
of
savoy
whose
summits
were
bright
with
snow
descended
in
broken
slopes
to
the
lake
on
high
the
rocks
were
dark
with
pine
forests
which
become
deeper
and
more
immense
until
the
ice
and
snow
mingle
with
the
points
of
naked
rock
that
pierce
the
blue
air
but
below
groves
of
walnut
chesnut
and
oak
with
openings
of
lawny
fields
attested
the
milder
climate
as
soon
as
we
had
passed
the
opposite
promontory
we
saw
the
river
drance
which
descends
from
between
a
chasm
in
the
mountains
and
makes
a
plain
near
the
lake
intersected
by
its
divided
streams
thousands
of
beautiful
like
but
smaller
with
purple
on
their
backs
take
their
station
on
the
shallows
where
its
waters
mingle
with
the
lake
as
we
approached
evian
the
mountains
descended
more
precipitously
to
the
lake
and
masses
of
intermingled
wood
and
rock
overhung
its
shining
spire
we
arrived
at
this
town
about
seven
after
a
day
which
involved
more
rapid
changes
of
atmosphere
than
i
ever
recollect
to
have
observed
before
the
morning
was
cold
and
wet
then
an
easterly
wind
and
the
clouds
hard
and
high
then
thunder
showers
and
wind
shifting
to
every
quarter
then
a
warm
blast
from
the
south
and
summer
clouds
hanging
over
the
peaks
with
bright
blue
sky
between
about
half
an
hour
after
we
had
arrived
at
evian
a
few
flashes
of
lightning
came
from
a
dark
cloud
directly
over
head
and
continued
after
the
cloud
had
dispersed
diespiter
per
pura
tonantes
egit
equos
a
phenomenon
which
certainly
had
no
influence
on
me
corresponding
with
that
which
it
produced
on
horace
the
appearance
of
the
inhabitants
of
evian
is
more
wretched
diseased
and
poor
than
i
ever
recollect
to
have
seen
the
contrast
indeed
between
the
subjects
of
the
king
of
sardinia
and
the
citizens
of
the
independent
republics
of
switzerland
affords
a
powerful
illustration
of
the
blighting
mischiefs
of
despotism
within
the
space
of
a
few
miles
they
have
mineral
waters
here
they
call
them
in
the
evening
we
had
some
difficulty
about
our
passports
but
so
soon
as
the
syndic
heard
my
companion
rank
and
name
he
apologized
for
the
circumstance
the
inn
was
good
during
our
voyage
on
the
distant
height
of
a
hill
covered
with
we
saw
a
ruined
castle
which
reminded
me
of
those
on
the
rhine
we
left
evian
on
the
following
morning
with
a
wind
of
such
violence
as
to
permit
but
one
sail
to
be
carried
the
waves
also
were
exceedingly
high
and
our
boat
so
heavily
laden
that
there
appeared
to
be
some
danger
we
arrived
however
safe
at
mellerie
after
passing
with
great
speed
mighty
forests
which
overhung
the
lake
and
lawns
of
exquisite
verdure
and
mountains
with
bare
and
icy
points
which
rose
immediately
from
the
summit
of
the
rocks
whose
bases
were
echoing
to
the
waves
we
here
heard
that
the
empress
maria
louisa
had
slept
at
mellerie
before
the
present
inn
was
built
and
when
the
accommodations
were
those
of
the
most
wretched
village
in
remembrance
of
preux
how
beautiful
it
is
to
find
that
the
common
sentiments
of
human
nature
can
attach
themselves
to
those
who
are
the
most
removed
from
its
duties
and
its
enjoyments
when
genius
pleads
for
their
admission
at
the
gate
of
power
to
own
them
was
becoming
in
the
empress
and
confirms
the
affectionate
praise
contained
in
the
regret
of
a
great
and
enlightened
nation
a
bourbon
dared
not
even
to
have
remembered
rousseau
she
owed
this
power
to
that
democracy
which
her
husband
dynasty
outraged
and
of
which
it
was
however
in
some
sort
the
representative
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
this
little
incident
shews
at
once
how
unfit
and
how
impossible
it
is
for
the
ancient
system
of
opinions
or
for
any
power
built
upon
a
conspiracy
to
revive
them
permanently
to
subsist
among
mankind
we
dined
there
and
had
some
honey
the
best
i
have
ever
tasted
the
very
essence
of
the
mountain
flowers
and
as
fragrant
probably
the
village
derives
its
name
from
this
production
mellerie
is
the
well
known
scene
of
preux
visionary
exile
but
mellerie
is
indeed
inchanted
ground
were
rousseau
no
magician
groves
of
pine
chesnut
and
walnut
overshadow
it
magnificent
and
unbounded
forests
to
which
england
affords
no
parallel
in
the
midst
of
these
woods
are
dells
of
lawny
expanse
inconceivably
verdant
adorned
with
a
thousand
of
the
rarest
flowers
and
odorous
with
thyme
the
lake
appeared
somewhat
calmer
as
we
left
mellerie
sailing
close
to
the
banks
whose
magnificence
augmented
with
the
turn
of
every
promontory
but
we
congratulated
ourselves
too
soon
the
wind
gradually
increased
in
violence
until
it
blew
tremendously
and
as
it
came
from
the
remotest
extremity
of
the
lake
produced
waves
of
a
frightful
height
and
covered
the
whole
surface
with
a
chaos
of
foam
one
of
our
boatmen
who
was
a
dreadfully
stupid
fellow
persisted
in
holding
the
sail
at
a
time
when
the
boat
was
on
the
point
of
being
driven
under
water
by
the
hurricane
on
discovering
his
error
he
let
it
entirely
go
and
the
boat
for
a
moment
refused
to
obey
the
helm
in
addition
the
rudder
was
so
broken
as
to
render
the
management
of
it
very
difficult
one
wave
fell
in
and
then
another
my
companion
an
excellent
swimmer
took
off
his
coat
i
did
the
same
and
we
sat
with
our
arms
crossed
every
instant
expecting
to
be
swamped
the
sail
was
however
again
held
the
boat
obeyed
the
helm
and
still
in
imminent
peril
from
the
immensity
of
the
waves
we
arrived
in
a
few
minutes
at
a
sheltered
port
in
the
village
of
gingoux
i
felt
in
this
near
prospect
of
death
a
mixture
of
sensations
among
which
terror
entered
though
but
subordinately
my
feelings
would
have
been
less
painful
had
i
been
alone
but
i
know
that
my
companion
would
have
attempted
to
save
me
and
i
was
overcome
with
humiliation
when
i
thought
that
his
life
might
have
been
risked
to
preserve
mine
when
we
arrived
at
gingoux
the
inhabitants
who
stood
on
the
shore
unaccustomed
to
see
a
vessel
as
frail
as
ours
and
fearing
to
venture
at
all
on
such
a
sea
exchanged
looks
of
wonder
and
congratulation
with
our
boatmen
who
as
well
as
ourselves
were
well
pleased
to
set
foot
on
shore
gingoux
is
even
more
beautiful
than
mellerie
the
mountains
are
higher
and
their
loftiest
points
of
elevation
descend
more
abruptly
to
the
lake
on
high
the
aerial
summits
still
cherish
great
depths
of
snow
in
their
ravines
and
in
the
paths
of
their
unseen
torrents
one
of
the
highest
of
these
is
called
roche
de
julien
beneath
whose
pinnacles
the
forests
become
deeper
and
more
extensive
the
chesnut
gives
a
peculiarity
to
the
scene
which
is
most
beautiful
and
will
make
a
picture
in
my
memory
distinct
from
all
other
mountain
scenes
which
i
have
ever
before
visited
as
we
arrived
here
early
we
took
a
to
visit
the
mouth
of
the
rhone
we
went
between
the
mountains
and
the
lake
under
groves
of
mighty
chesnut
trees
beside
perpetual
streams
which
are
nourished
by
the
snows
above
and
form
stalactites
on
the
rocks
over
which
they
fall
we
saw
an
immense
chesnut
tree
which
had
been
overthrown
by
the
hurricane
of
the
morning
the
place
where
the
rhone
joins
the
lake
was
marked
by
a
line
of
tremendous
breakers
the
river
is
as
rapid
as
when
it
leaves
the
lake
but
is
muddy
and
dark
we
went
about
a
league
farther
on
the
road
to
la
valais
and
stopped
at
a
castle
called
la
tour
de
bouverie
which
seems
to
be
the
frontier
of
switzerland
and
savoy
as
we
were
asked
for
our
passports
on
the
supposition
of
our
proceeding
to
italy
on
one
side
of
the
road
was
the
immense
roche
de
julien
which
overhung
it
through
the
gateway
of
the
castle
we
saw
the
snowy
mountains
of
la
valais
clothed
in
clouds
and
on
the
other
side
was
the
willowy
plain
of
the
rhone
in
a
character
of
striking
contrast
with
the
rest
of
the
scene
bounded
by
the
dark
mountains
that
overhang
clarens
vevai
and
the
lake
that
rolls
between
in
the
midst
of
the
plain
rises
a
little
isolated
hill
on
which
the
white
spire
of
a
church
peeps
from
among
the
tufted
chesnut
woods
we
returned
to
gingoux
before
sunset
and
i
passed
the
evening
in
reading
julie
as
my
companion
rises
late
i
had
time
before
breakfast
on
the
ensuing
morning
to
hunt
the
waterfalls
of
the
river
that
fall
into
the
lake
at
gingoux
the
stream
is
indeed
from
the
declivity
over
which
it
falls
only
a
succession
of
waterfalls
which
roar
over
the
rocks
with
a
perpetual
sound
and
suspend
their
unceasing
spray
on
the
leaves
and
flowers
that
overhang
and
adorn
its
savage
banks
the
path
that
conducted
along
this
river
sometimes
avoided
the
precipices
of
its
shores
by
leading
through
meadows
sometimes
threaded
the
base
of
the
perpendicular
and
caverned
rocks
i
gathered
in
these
meadows
a
nosegay
of
such
flowers
as
i
never
saw
in
england
and
which
i
thought
more
beautiful
for
that
rarity
on
my
return
after
breakfast
we
sailed
for
clarens
determining
first
to
see
the
three
mouths
of
the
rhone
and
then
the
castle
of
chillon
the
day
was
fine
and
the
water
calm
we
passed
from
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
over
the
stream
of
the
rhone
which
is
rapid
even
at
a
great
distance
from
its
confluence
with
the
lake
the
turbid
waters
mixed
with
those
of
the
lake
but
mixed
with
them
unwillingly
nouvelle
heloise
lettre
part
i
read
julie
all
day
an
overflowing
as
it
now
seems
surrounded
by
the
scenes
which
it
has
so
wonderfully
peopled
of
sublimest
genius
and
more
than
human
sensibility
mellerie
the
castle
of
chillon
clarens
the
mountains
of
la
valais
and
savoy
present
themselves
to
the
imagination
as
monuments
of
things
that
were
once
familiar
and
of
beings
that
were
once
dear
to
it
they
were
created
indeed
by
one
mind
but
a
mind
so
powerfully
bright
as
to
cast
a
shade
of
falsehood
on
the
records
that
are
called
reality
we
passed
on
to
the
castle
of
chillon
and
visited
its
dungeons
and
towers
these
prisons
are
excavated
below
the
lake
the
principal
dungeon
is
supported
by
seven
columns
whose
branching
capitals
support
the
roof
close
to
the
very
walls
the
lake
is
feet
deep
iron
rings
are
fastened
to
these
columns
and
on
them
were
engraven
a
multitude
of
names
partly
those
of
visitors
and
partly
doubtless
of
the
prisoners
of
whom
now
no
memory
remains
and
who
thus
beguiled
a
solitude
which
they
have
long
ceased
to
feel
one
date
was
as
ancient
as
at
the
commencement
of
the
reformation
and
indeed
long
after
that
period
this
dungeon
was
the
receptacle
of
those
who
shook
or
who
denied
the
system
of
idolatry
from
the
effects
of
which
mankind
is
even
now
slowly
emerging
close
to
this
long
and
lofty
dungeon
was
a
narrow
cell
and
beyond
it
one
larger
and
far
more
lofty
and
dark
supported
upon
two
unornamented
arches
across
one
of
these
arches
was
a
beam
now
black
and
rotten
on
which
prisoners
were
hung
in
secret
i
never
saw
a
monument
more
terrible
of
that
cold
and
inhuman
tyranny
which
it
has
been
the
delight
of
man
to
exercise
over
man
it
was
indeed
one
of
those
many
tremendous
fulfilments
which
render
the
pernicies
humani
generis
of
the
great
tacitus
so
solemn
and
irrefragable
a
prophecy
the
gendarme
who
conducted
us
over
this
castle
told
us
that
there
was
an
opening
to
the
lake
by
means
of
a
secret
spring
connected
with
which
the
whole
dungeon
might
be
filled
with
water
before
the
prisoners
could
possibly
escape
we
proceeded
with
a
contrary
wind
to
clarens
against
a
heavy
swell
i
never
felt
more
strongly
than
on
landing
at
clarens
that
the
spirit
of
old
times
had
deserted
its
once
cherished
habitation
a
thousand
times
thought
i
have
julia
and
preux
walked
on
this
terraced
road
looking
towards
these
mountains
which
i
now
behold
nay
treading
on
the
ground
where
i
now
tread
from
the
window
of
our
lodging
our
landlady
pointed
out
le
bosquet
de
at
least
the
inhabitants
of
this
village
are
impressed
with
an
idea
that
the
persons
of
that
romance
had
actual
existence
in
the
evening
we
walked
thither
it
is
indeed
wood
the
hay
was
making
under
the
trees
the
trees
themselves
were
aged
but
vigorous
and
interspersed
with
younger
ones
which
are
destined
to
be
their
successors
and
in
future
years
when
we
are
dead
to
afford
a
shade
to
future
worshippers
of
nature
who
love
the
memory
of
that
tenderness
and
peace
of
which
this
was
the
imaginary
abode
we
walked
forward
among
the
vineyards
whose
narrow
terraces
overlook
this
affecting
scene
why
did
the
cold
maxims
of
the
world
compel
me
at
this
moment
to
repress
the
tears
of
melancholy
transport
which
it
would
have
been
so
sweet
to
indulge
immeasurably
even
until
the
darkness
of
night
had
swallowed
up
the
objects
which
excited
them
i
forgot
to
remark
what
indeed
my
companion
remarked
to
me
that
our
danger
from
the
storm
took
place
precisely
in
the
spot
where
julie
and
her
lover
were
nearly
overset
and
where
preux
was
tempted
to
plunge
with
her
into
the
lake
on
the
following
day
we
went
to
see
the
castle
of
clarens
a
square
strong
house
with
very
few
windows
surrounded
by
a
double
terrace
that
overlooks
the
valley
or
rather
the
plain
of
clarens
the
road
which
conducted
to
it
wound
up
the
steep
ascent
through
woods
of
walnut
and
chesnut
we
gathered
roses
on
the
terrace
in
the
feeling
that
they
might
be
the
posterity
of
some
planted
by
julia
hand
we
sent
their
dead
and
withered
leaves
to
the
absent
we
went
again
to
the
bosquet
de
julie
and
found
that
the
precise
spot
was
now
utterly
obliterated
and
a
heap
of
stones
marked
the
place
where
the
little
chapel
had
once
stood
whilst
we
were
execrating
the
author
of
this
brutal
folly
our
guide
informed
us
that
the
land
belonged
to
the
convent
of
bernard
and
that
this
outrage
had
been
committed
by
their
orders
i
knew
before
that
if
avarice
could
harden
the
hearts
of
men
a
system
of
prescriptive
religion
has
an
influence
far
more
inimical
to
natural
sensibility
i
know
that
an
isolated
man
is
sometimes
restrained
by
shame
from
outraging
the
venerable
feelings
arising
out
of
the
memory
of
genius
which
once
made
nature
even
lovelier
than
itself
but
associated
man
holds
it
as
the
very
sacrament
of
his
union
to
forswear
all
delicacy
all
benevolence
all
remorse
all
that
is
true
or
tender
or
sublime
we
sailed
from
clarens
to
vevai
vevai
is
a
town
more
beautiful
in
its
simplicity
than
any
i
have
ever
seen
its
a
spacious
square
interspersed
with
trees
looks
directly
upon
the
mountains
of
savoy
and
la
valais
the
lake
and
the
valley
of
the
rhone
it
was
at
vevai
that
rousseau
conceived
the
design
of
julie
from
vevai
we
came
to
ouchy
a
village
near
lausanne
the
coasts
of
the
pays
de
vaud
though
full
of
villages
and
vineyards
present
an
aspect
of
tranquillity
and
peculiar
beauty
which
well
compensates
for
the
solitude
which
i
am
accustomed
to
admire
the
hills
are
very
high
and
rocky
crowned
and
interspersed
with
woods
echo
from
the
cliffs
and
shine
afar
in
one
place
we
saw
the
traces
of
two
rocks
of
immense
size
which
had
fallen
from
the
mountain
behind
one
of
these
lodged
in
a
room
where
a
young
woman
was
sleeping
without
injuring
her
the
vineyards
were
utterly
destroyed
in
its
path
and
the
earth
torn
up
the
rain
detained
us
two
days
at
ouchy
we
however
visited
lausanne
and
saw
gibbon
house
we
were
shewn
the
decayed
where
he
finished
his
history
and
the
old
acacias
on
the
terrace
from
which
he
saw
mont
blanc
after
having
written
the
last
sentence
there
is
something
grand
and
even
touching
in
the
regret
which
he
expresses
at
the
completion
of
his
task
it
was
conceived
amid
the
ruins
of
the
capitol
the
sudden
departure
of
his
cherished
and
accustomed
toil
must
have
left
him
like
the
death
of
a
dear
friend
sad
and
solitary
my
companion
gathered
some
acacia
leaves
to
preserve
in
remembrance
of
him
i
refrained
from
doing
so
fearing
to
outrage
the
greater
and
more
sacred
name
of
rousseau
the
contemplation
of
whose
imperishable
creations
had
left
no
vacancy
in
my
heart
for
mortal
things
gibbon
had
a
cold
and
unimpassioned
spirit
i
never
felt
more
inclination
to
rail
at
the
prejudices
which
cling
to
such
a
thing
than
now
that
julie
and
clarens
lausanne
and
the
roman
empire
compelled
me
to
a
contrast
between
rousseau
and
gibbon
when
we
returned
in
the
only
interval
of
sunshine
during
the
day
i
walked
on
the
pier
which
the
lake
was
lashing
with
its
waves
a
rainbow
spanned
the
lake
or
rather
rested
one
extremity
of
its
arch
upon
the
water
and
the
other
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
of
savoy
some
white
houses
i
know
not
if
they
were
those
of
mellerie
shone
through
the
yellow
fire
on
saturday
the
of
june
we
quitted
ouchy
and
after
two
days
of
pleasant
sailing
arrived
on
sunday
evening
at
montalegre
letter
iv
to
esq
blanc
hôtel
de
londres
chamouni
july
whilst
you
my
friend
are
engaged
in
securing
a
home
for
us
we
are
wandering
in
search
of
recollections
to
embellish
it
i
do
not
err
in
conceiving
that
you
are
interested
in
details
of
all
that
is
majestic
or
beautiful
in
nature
but
how
shall
i
describe
to
you
the
scenes
by
which
i
am
now
surrounded
to
exhaust
the
epithets
which
express
the
astonishment
and
the
very
excess
of
satisfied
astonishment
where
expectation
scarcely
acknowledged
any
boundary
is
this
to
impress
upon
your
mind
the
images
which
fill
mine
now
even
till
it
overflow
i
too
have
read
the
raptures
of
travellers
i
will
be
warned
by
their
example
i
will
simply
detail
to
you
all
that
i
can
relate
or
all
that
if
related
would
enable
you
to
conceive
of
what
we
have
done
or
seen
since
the
morning
of
the
when
we
left
geneva
we
commenced
our
intended
journey
to
chamouni
at
eight
in
the
morning
we
passed
through
the
champain
country
which
extends
from
mont
salève
to
the
base
of
the
higher
alps
the
country
is
sufficiently
fertile
covered
with
corn
fields
and
orchards
and
intersected
by
sudden
acclivities
with
flat
summits
the
day
was
cloudless
and
excessively
hot
the
alps
were
perpetually
in
sight
and
as
we
advanced
the
mountains
which
form
their
outskirts
closed
in
around
us
we
passed
a
bridge
over
a
stream
which
discharges
itself
into
the
arve
the
arve
itself
much
swollen
by
the
rains
flows
constantly
to
the
right
of
the
road
as
we
approached
bonneville
through
an
avenue
composed
of
a
beautiful
species
of
drooping
poplar
we
observed
that
the
corn
fields
on
each
side
were
covered
with
inundation
bonneville
is
a
neat
little
town
with
no
conspicuous
peculiarity
except
the
white
towers
of
the
prison
an
extensive
building
overlooking
the
town
at
bonneville
the
alps
commence
one
of
which
clothed
by
forests
rises
almost
immediately
from
the
opposite
bank
of
the
arve
from
bonneville
to
cluses
the
road
conducts
through
a
spacious
and
fertile
plain
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
mountains
covered
like
those
of
mellerie
with
forests
of
intermingled
pine
and
chesnut
at
cluses
the
road
turns
suddenly
to
the
right
following
the
arve
along
the
chasm
which
it
seems
to
have
hollowed
for
itself
among
the
perpendicular
mountains
the
scene
assumes
here
a
more
savage
and
colossal
character
the
valley
becomes
narrow
affording
no
more
space
than
is
sufficient
for
the
river
and
the
road
the
pines
descend
to
the
banks
imitating
with
their
irregular
spires
the
pyramidal
crags
which
lift
themselves
far
above
the
regions
of
forest
into
the
deep
azure
of
the
sky
and
among
the
white
dazzling
clouds
the
scene
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
from
cluses
differs
from
that
of
matlock
in
little
else
than
in
the
immensity
of
its
proportions
and
in
its
untameable
inaccessible
solitude
inhabited
only
by
the
goats
which
we
saw
browsing
on
the
rocks
near
maglans
within
a
league
of
each
other
we
saw
two
waterfalls
they
were
no
more
than
mountain
rivulets
but
the
height
from
which
they
fell
at
least
of
hundred
feet
made
them
assume
a
character
inconsistent
with
the
smallness
of
their
stream
the
first
fell
from
the
overhanging
brow
of
a
black
precipice
on
an
enormous
rock
precisely
resembling
some
colossal
egyptian
statue
of
a
female
deity
it
struck
the
head
of
the
visionary
image
and
gracefully
dividing
there
fell
from
it
in
folds
of
foam
more
like
to
cloud
than
water
imitating
a
veil
of
the
most
exquisite
woof
it
then
united
concealing
the
lower
part
of
the
statue
and
hiding
itself
in
a
winding
of
its
channel
burst
into
a
deeper
fall
and
crossed
our
route
in
its
path
towards
the
arve
the
other
waterfall
was
more
continuous
and
larger
the
violence
with
which
it
fell
made
it
look
more
like
some
shape
which
an
exhalation
had
assumed
than
like
water
for
it
streamed
beyond
the
mountain
which
appeared
dark
behind
it
as
it
might
have
appeared
behind
an
evanescent
cloud
the
character
of
the
scenery
continued
the
same
until
we
arrived
at
martin
called
in
the
maps
sallanches
the
mountains
perpetually
becoming
more
elevated
exhibiting
at
every
turn
of
the
road
more
craggy
summits
loftier
and
wider
extent
of
forests
darker
and
more
deep
recesses
the
following
morning
we
proceeded
from
martin
on
mules
to
chamouni
accompanied
by
two
guides
we
proceeded
as
we
had
done
the
preceding
day
along
the
valley
of
the
arve
a
valley
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
immense
mountains
whose
rugged
precipices
are
intermixed
on
high
with
dazzling
snow
their
bases
were
still
covered
with
the
eternal
forests
which
perpetually
grew
darker
and
more
profound
as
we
approached
the
inner
regions
of
the
mountains
on
arriving
at
a
small
village
at
the
distance
of
a
league
from
martin
we
dismounted
from
our
mules
and
were
conducted
by
our
guides
to
view
a
cascade
we
beheld
an
immense
body
of
water
fall
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
dashing
from
rock
to
rock
and
casting
a
spray
which
formed
a
mist
around
it
in
the
midst
of
which
hung
a
multitude
of
sunbows
which
faded
or
became
unspeakably
vivid
as
the
inconstant
sun
shone
through
the
clouds
when
we
approached
near
to
it
the
rain
of
the
spray
reached
us
and
our
clothes
were
wetted
by
the
but
minute
particles
of
water
the
cataract
fell
from
above
into
a
deep
craggy
chasm
at
our
feet
where
changing
its
character
to
that
of
a
mountain
stream
it
pursued
its
course
towards
the
arve
roaring
over
the
rocks
that
impeded
its
progress
as
we
proceeded
our
route
still
lay
through
the
valley
or
rather
as
it
had
now
become
the
vast
ravine
which
is
at
once
the
couch
and
the
creation
of
the
terrible
arve
we
ascended
winding
between
mountains
whose
immensity
staggers
the
imagination
we
crossed
the
path
of
a
torrent
which
three
days
since
had
descended
from
the
thawing
snow
and
torn
the
road
away
we
dined
at
servoz
a
little
village
where
there
are
lead
and
copper
mines
and
where
we
saw
a
cabinet
of
natural
curiosities
like
those
of
keswick
and
bethgelert
we
saw
in
this
cabinet
some
chamois
horns
and
the
horns
of
an
exceedingly
rare
animal
called
the
bouquetin
which
inhabits
the
desarts
of
snow
to
the
south
of
mont
blanc
it
is
an
animal
of
the
stag
kind
its
horns
weigh
at
least
english
pounds
it
is
inconceivable
how
so
small
an
animal
could
support
so
inordinate
a
weight
the
horns
are
of
a
very
peculiar
conformation
being
broad
massy
and
pointed
at
the
ends
and
surrounded
with
a
number
of
rings
which
are
supposed
to
afford
an
indication
of
its
age
there
were
seventeen
rings
on
the
largest
of
these
horns
from
servoz
three
leagues
remain
to
blanc
was
before
alps
with
their
innumerable
glaciers
on
high
all
around
closing
in
the
complicated
windings
of
the
single
inexpressibly
beautiful
but
majestic
in
their
beech
and
pine
and
oak
overshadowed
our
road
or
receded
whilst
lawns
of
such
verdure
as
i
have
never
seen
before
occupied
these
openings
and
gradually
became
darker
in
their
recesses
mont
blanc
was
before
us
but
it
was
covered
with
cloud
its
base
furrowed
with
dreadful
gaps
was
seen
above
pinnacles
of
snow
intolerably
bright
part
of
the
chain
connected
with
mont
blanc
shone
through
the
clouds
at
intervals
on
high
i
never
never
imagined
what
mountains
were
before
the
immensity
of
these
aerial
summits
excited
when
they
suddenly
burst
upon
the
sight
a
sentiment
of
extatic
wonder
not
unallied
to
madness
and
remember
this
was
all
one
scene
it
all
pressed
home
to
our
regard
and
our
imagination
though
it
embraced
a
vast
extent
of
space
the
snowy
pyramids
which
shot
into
the
bright
blue
sky
seemed
to
overhang
our
path
the
ravine
clothed
with
gigantic
pines
and
black
with
its
depth
below
so
deep
that
the
very
roaring
of
the
untameable
arve
which
rolled
through
it
could
not
be
heard
was
as
much
our
own
as
if
we
had
been
the
creators
of
such
impressions
in
the
minds
of
others
as
now
occupied
our
own
nature
was
the
poet
whose
harmony
held
our
spirits
more
breathless
than
that
of
the
divinest
as
we
entered
the
valley
of
chamouni
which
in
fact
may
be
considered
as
a
continuation
of
those
which
we
have
followed
from
bonneville
and
cluses
clouds
hung
upon
the
mountains
at
the
distance
perhaps
of
feet
from
the
earth
but
so
as
effectually
to
conceal
not
only
mont
blanc
but
the
other
as
they
call
them
here
attached
and
subordinate
to
it
we
were
travelling
along
the
valley
when
suddenly
we
heard
a
sound
as
of
the
burst
of
smothered
thunder
rolling
above
yet
there
was
something
earthly
in
the
sound
that
told
us
it
could
not
be
thunder
our
guide
hastily
pointed
out
to
us
a
part
of
the
mountain
opposite
from
whence
the
sound
came
it
was
an
avalanche
we
saw
the
smoke
of
its
path
among
the
rocks
and
continued
to
hear
at
intervals
the
bursting
of
its
fall
it
fell
on
the
bed
of
a
torrent
which
it
displaced
and
presently
we
saw
its
waters
also
spread
themselves
over
the
ravine
which
was
their
couch
we
did
not
as
we
intended
visit
the
de
although
it
descends
within
a
few
minutes
walk
of
the
road
wishing
to
survey
it
at
least
when
unfatigued
we
saw
this
glacier
which
comes
close
to
the
fertile
plain
as
we
passed
its
surface
was
broken
into
a
thousand
unaccountable
figures
conical
and
pyramidical
crystallizations
more
than
fifty
feet
in
height
rise
from
its
surface
and
precipices
of
ice
of
dazzling
splendour
overhang
the
woods
and
meadows
of
the
vale
this
glacier
winds
upwards
from
the
valley
until
it
joins
the
masses
of
frost
from
which
it
was
produced
above
winding
through
its
own
ravine
like
a
bright
belt
flung
over
the
black
region
of
pines
there
is
more
in
all
these
scenes
than
mere
magnitude
of
proportion
there
is
a
majesty
of
outline
there
is
an
awful
grace
in
the
very
colours
which
invest
these
wonderful
charm
which
is
peculiar
to
them
quite
distinct
even
from
the
reality
of
their
unutterable
greatness
july
yesterday
morning
we
went
to
the
source
of
the
arveiron
it
is
about
a
league
from
this
village
the
river
rolls
forth
impetuously
from
an
arch
of
ice
and
spreads
itself
in
many
streams
over
a
vast
space
of
the
valley
ravaged
and
laid
bare
by
its
inundations
the
glacier
by
which
its
waters
are
nourished
overhangs
this
cavern
and
the
plain
and
the
forests
of
pine
which
surround
it
with
terrible
precipices
of
solid
ice
on
the
other
side
rises
the
immense
glacier
of
montanvert
fifty
miles
in
extent
occupying
a
chasm
among
mountains
of
inconceivable
height
and
of
forms
so
pointed
and
abrupt
that
they
seem
to
pierce
the
sky
from
this
glacier
we
saw
as
we
sat
on
a
rock
close
to
one
of
the
streams
of
the
arveiron
masses
of
ice
detach
themselves
from
on
high
and
rush
with
a
loud
dull
noise
into
the
vale
the
violence
of
their
fall
turned
them
into
powder
which
flowed
over
the
rocks
in
imitation
of
waterfalls
whose
ravines
they
usurped
and
filled
in
the
evening
i
went
with
ducrée
my
guide
the
only
tolerable
person
i
have
seen
in
this
country
to
visit
the
glacier
of
boisson
this
glacier
like
that
of
montanvert
comes
close
to
the
vale
overhanging
the
green
meadows
and
the
dark
woods
with
the
dazzling
whiteness
of
its
precipices
and
pinnacles
which
are
like
spires
of
radiant
crystal
covered
with
a
of
frosted
silver
these
glaciers
flow
perpetually
into
the
valley
ravaging
in
their
slow
but
irresistible
progress
the
pastures
and
the
forests
which
surround
them
performing
a
work
of
desolation
in
ages
which
a
river
of
lava
might
accomplish
in
an
hour
but
far
more
irretrievably
for
where
the
ice
has
once
descended
the
hardiest
plant
refuses
to
grow
if
even
as
in
some
extraordinary
instances
it
should
recede
after
its
progress
has
once
commenced
the
glaciers
perpetually
move
onward
at
the
rate
of
a
foot
each
day
with
a
motion
that
commences
at
the
spot
where
on
the
boundaries
of
perpetual
congelation
they
are
produced
by
the
freezing
of
the
waters
which
arise
from
the
partial
melting
of
the
eternal
snows
they
drag
with
them
from
the
regions
whence
they
derive
their
origin
all
the
ruins
of
the
mountain
enormous
rocks
and
immense
accumulations
of
sand
and
stones
these
are
driven
onwards
by
the
irresistible
stream
of
solid
ice
and
when
they
arrive
at
a
declivity
of
the
mountain
sufficiently
rapid
roll
down
scattering
ruin
i
saw
one
of
these
rocks
which
had
descended
in
the
spring
winter
here
is
the
season
of
silence
and
safety
which
measured
forty
feet
in
every
direction
the
verge
of
a
glacier
like
that
of
boisson
presents
the
most
vivid
image
of
desolation
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
no
one
dares
to
approach
it
for
the
enormous
pinnacles
of
ice
which
perpetually
fall
are
perpetually
reproduced
the
pines
of
the
forest
which
bound
it
at
one
extremity
are
overthrown
and
shattered
to
a
wide
extent
at
its
base
there
is
something
inexpressibly
dreadful
in
the
aspect
of
the
few
branchless
trunks
which
nearest
to
the
ice
rifts
still
stand
in
the
uprooted
soil
the
meadows
perish
overwhelmed
with
sand
and
stones
within
this
last
year
these
glaciers
have
advanced
three
hundred
feet
into
the
valley
saussure
the
naturalist
says
that
they
have
their
periods
of
increase
and
decay
the
people
of
the
country
hold
an
opinion
entirely
different
but
as
i
judge
more
probable
it
is
agreed
by
all
that
the
snow
on
the
summit
of
mont
blanc
and
the
neighbouring
mountains
perpetually
augments
and
that
ice
in
the
form
of
glaciers
subsists
without
melting
in
the
valley
of
chamouni
during
its
transient
and
variable
summer
if
the
snow
which
produces
this
glacier
must
augment
and
the
heat
of
the
valley
is
no
obstacle
to
the
perpetual
existence
of
such
masses
of
ice
as
have
already
descended
into
it
the
consequence
is
obvious
the
glaciers
must
augment
and
will
subsist
at
least
until
they
have
overflowed
this
vale
i
will
not
pursue
buffon
sublime
but
gloomy
this
globe
which
we
inhabit
will
at
some
future
period
be
changed
into
a
mass
of
frost
by
the
encroachments
of
the
polar
ice
and
of
that
produced
on
the
most
elevated
points
of
the
earth
do
you
who
assert
the
supremacy
of
ahriman
imagine
him
throned
among
these
desolating
snows
among
these
palaces
of
death
and
frost
so
sculptured
in
this
their
terrible
magnificence
by
the
adamantine
hand
of
necessity
and
that
he
casts
around
him
as
the
first
essays
of
his
final
usurpation
avalanches
torrents
rocks
and
thunders
and
above
all
these
deadly
glaciers
at
once
the
proof
and
symbols
of
his
reign
to
this
the
degradation
of
the
human
in
these
regions
are
half
deformed
or
idiotic
and
most
of
whom
are
deprived
of
any
thing
that
can
excite
interest
or
admiration
this
is
a
part
of
the
subject
more
mournful
and
less
sublime
but
such
as
neither
the
poet
nor
the
philosopher
should
disdain
to
regard
this
morning
we
departed
on
the
promise
of
a
fine
day
to
visit
the
glacier
of
montanvert
in
that
part
where
it
fills
a
slanting
valley
it
is
called
the
sea
of
ice
this
valley
is
toises
or
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
we
had
not
proceeded
far
before
the
rain
began
to
fall
but
we
persisted
until
we
had
accomplished
more
than
half
of
our
journey
when
we
returned
wet
through
chamouni
july
we
have
returned
from
visiting
the
glacier
of
montanvert
or
as
it
is
called
the
sea
of
ice
a
scene
in
truth
of
dizzying
wonder
the
path
that
winds
to
it
along
the
side
of
a
mountain
now
clothed
with
pines
now
intersected
with
snowy
hollows
is
wide
and
steep
the
cabin
of
montanvert
is
three
leagues
from
chamouni
half
of
which
distance
is
performed
on
mules
not
so
sure
footed
but
that
on
the
first
day
the
one
which
i
rode
fell
in
what
the
guides
call
a
so
that
i
narrowly
escaped
being
precipitated
down
the
mountain
we
passed
over
a
hollow
covered
with
snow
down
which
vast
stones
are
accustomed
to
roll
one
had
fallen
the
preceding
day
a
little
time
after
we
had
returned
our
guides
desired
us
to
pass
quickly
for
it
is
said
that
sometimes
the
least
sound
will
accelerate
their
descent
we
arrived
at
montanvert
however
safe
on
all
sides
precipitous
mountains
the
abodes
of
unrelenting
frost
surround
this
vale
their
sides
are
banked
up
with
ice
and
snow
broken
heaped
high
and
exhibiting
terrific
chasms
the
summits
are
sharp
and
naked
pinnacles
whose
overhanging
steepness
will
not
even
permit
snow
to
rest
upon
them
lines
of
dazzling
ice
occupy
here
and
there
their
perpendicular
rifts
and
shine
through
the
driving
vapours
with
inexpressible
brilliance
they
pierce
the
clouds
like
things
not
belonging
to
this
earth
the
vale
itself
is
filled
with
a
mass
of
undulating
ice
and
has
an
ascent
sufficiently
gradual
even
to
the
remotest
abysses
of
these
horrible
desarts
it
is
only
half
a
league
about
two
miles
in
breadth
and
seems
much
less
it
exhibits
an
appearance
as
if
frost
had
suddenly
bound
up
the
waves
and
whirlpools
of
a
mighty
torrent
we
walked
some
distance
upon
its
surface
the
waves
are
elevated
about
or
feet
from
the
surface
of
the
mass
which
is
intersected
by
long
gaps
of
unfathomable
depth
the
ice
of
whose
sides
is
more
beautifully
azure
than
the
sky
in
these
regions
every
thing
changes
and
is
in
motion
this
vast
mass
of
ice
has
one
general
progress
which
ceases
neither
day
nor
night
it
breaks
and
bursts
for
ever
some
undulations
sink
while
others
rise
it
is
never
the
same
the
echo
of
rocks
or
of
the
ice
and
snow
which
fall
from
their
overhanging
precipices
or
roll
from
their
aerial
summits
scarcely
ceases
for
one
moment
one
would
think
that
mont
blanc
like
the
god
of
the
stoics
was
a
vast
animal
and
that
the
frozen
blood
for
ever
circulated
through
his
stony
veins
we
dined
and
i
on
the
grass
in
the
open
air
surrounded
by
this
scene
the
air
is
piercing
and
clear
we
returned
down
the
mountain
sometimes
encompassed
by
the
driving
vapours
sometimes
cheered
by
the
sunbeams
and
arrived
at
our
inn
by
seven
montalegre
july
the
next
morning
we
returned
through
the
rain
to
martin
the
scenery
had
lost
something
of
its
immensity
thick
clouds
hanging
over
the
highest
mountains
but
visitings
of
sunset
intervened
between
the
showers
and
the
blue
sky
shone
between
the
accumulated
clouds
of
snowy
whiteness
which
brought
them
the
dazzling
mountains
sometimes
glittered
through
a
chasm
of
the
clouds
above
our
heads
and
all
the
charm
of
its
grandeur
remained
we
repassed
a
wooden
bridge
over
the
arve
and
the
ravine
of
the
arve
we
repassed
the
pine
forests
which
overhang
the
defile
the
chateau
of
michel
a
haunted
ruin
built
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
and
shadowed
over
by
the
eternal
forest
we
repassed
the
vale
of
servoz
a
vale
more
beautiful
because
more
luxuriant
than
that
of
chamouni
mont
blanc
forms
one
of
the
sides
of
this
vale
also
and
the
other
is
inclosed
by
an
irregular
amphitheatre
of
enormous
mountains
one
of
which
is
in
ruins
and
fell
fifty
years
ago
into
the
higher
part
of
the
valley
the
smoke
of
its
fall
was
seen
in
piedmont
and
people
went
from
turin
to
investigate
whether
a
volcano
had
not
burst
forth
among
the
alps
it
continued
falling
many
days
spreading
with
the
shock
and
thunder
of
its
ruin
consternation
into
the
neighbouring
vales
in
the
evening
we
arrived
at
martin
the
next
day
we
wound
through
the
valley
which
i
have
described
before
and
arrived
in
the
evening
at
our
home
we
have
bought
some
specimens
of
minerals
and
plants
and
two
or
three
crystal
seals
at
mont
blanc
to
preserve
the
remembrance
of
having
approached
it
there
is
a
cabinet
of
at
chamouni
just
as
at
keswick
matlock
and
clifton
the
proprietor
of
which
is
the
very
vilest
specimen
of
that
vile
species
of
quack
that
together
with
the
whole
army
of
aubergistes
and
guides
and
indeed
the
entire
mass
of
the
population
subsist
on
the
weakness
and
credulity
of
travellers
as
leaches
subsist
on
the
sick
the
most
interesting
of
my
purchases
is
a
large
collection
of
all
the
seeds
of
rare
alpine
plants
with
their
names
written
upon
the
outside
of
the
papers
that
contain
them
these
i
mean
to
colonize
in
my
garden
in
england
and
to
permit
you
to
make
what
choice
you
please
from
them
they
are
companions
which
the
classic
celandine
need
not
despise
they
are
as
wild
and
more
daring
than
he
and
will
tell
him
tales
of
things
even
as
touching
and
sublime
as
the
gaze
of
a
vernal
poet
did
i
tell
you
that
there
are
troops
of
wolves
among
these
mountains
in
the
winter
they
descend
into
the
vallies
which
the
snow
occupies
six
months
of
the
year
and
devour
every
thing
that
they
can
find
out
of
doors
a
wolf
is
more
powerful
than
the
fiercest
and
strongest
dog
there
are
no
bears
in
these
regions
we
heard
when
we
were
at
lucerne
that
they
were
occasionally
found
in
the
forests
which
surround
that
lake

such
as
a
feeble
brook
will
oft
assume
in
the
wild
woods
among
the
mountains
lone
where
waterfalls
around
it
leap
for
ever
where
woods
and
winds
contend
and
a
vast
river
over
its
rocks
ceaselessly
bursts
and
raves
ii
thus
thou
ravine
of
deep
thou
vale
over
whose
pines
and
crags
and
caverns
sail
fast
cloud
shadows
and
sunbeams
awful
scene
where
power
in
likeness
of
the
arve
comes
down
from
the
ice
gulphs
that
gird
his
secret
throne
bursting
through
these
dark
mountains
like
the
flame
of
lightning
thro
the
tempest
dost
lie
thy
giant
brood
of
pines
around
thee
clinging
children
of
elder
time
in
whose
devotion
the
chainless
winds
still
come
and
ever
came
to
drink
their
odours
and
their
mighty
swinging
to
old
and
solemn
harmony
thine
earthly
rainbows
stretched
across
the
sweep
of
the
ethereal
waterfall
whose
veil
robes
some
unsculptured
image
the
strange
sleep
which
when
the
voices
of
the
desart
fail
wraps
all
in
its
own
deep
eternity
thy
caverns
echoing
to
the
arve
commotion
a
loud
lone
sound
no
other
sound
can
tame
thou
art
pervaded
with
that
ceaseless
motion
thou
art
the
path
of
that
unresting
dizzy
ravine
and
when
i
gaze
on
thee
i
seem
as
in
a
trance
sublime
and
strange
to
muse
on
my
own
separate
phantasy
my
own
my
human
mind
which
passively
now
renders
and
receives
fast
influencings
holding
an
unremitting
interchange
with
the
clear
universe
of
things
around
one
legion
of
wild
thoughts
whose
wandering
wings
now
float
above
thy
darkness
and
now
rest
where
that
or
thou
art
no
unbidden
guest
in
the
still
cave
of
the
witch
poesy
seeking
among
the
shadows
that
pass
by
ghosts
of
all
things
that
are
some
shade
of
thee
some
phantom
some
faint
image
till
the
breast
from
which
they
fled
recalls
them
thou
art
there
iii
some
say
that
gleams
of
a
remoter
world
visit
the
soul
in
sleep
death
is
slumber
and
that
its
shapes
the
busy
thoughts
outnumber
of
those
who
wake
and
look
on
high
has
some
unknown
omnipotence
unfurled
the
veil
of
life
and
death
or
do
i
lie
in
dream
and
does
the
mightier
world
of
sleep
spread
far
around
and
inaccessibly
its
circles
for
the
very
spirit
fails
driven
like
a
homeless
cloud
from
steep
to
steep
that
vanishes
among
the
viewless
gales
far
far
above
piercing
the
infinite
sky
mont
blanc

snowy
and
its
subject
mountains
their
unearthly
forms
pile
around
it
ice
and
rock
broad
vales
between
of
frozen
floods
unfathomable
deeps
blue
as
the
overhanging
heaven
that
spread
and
wind
among
the
accumulated
steeps
a
desart
peopled
by
the
storms
alone
save
when
the
eagle
brings
some
hunter
bone
and
the
wolf
tracts
her
hideously
its
shapes
are
heaped
around
rude
bare
and

ghastly
and
scarred
and
this
the
scene
where
the
old
taught
her
young
ruin
were
these
their
toys
or
did
a
sea
of
fire
envelope
once
this
silent
snow
none

seems
eternal
now
the
wilderness
has
a
mysterious
tongue
which
teaches
awful
doubt
or
faith
so
mild
so
solemn
so
serene
that
man
may
be
but
for
such
faith
with
nature
reconciled
thou
hast
a
voice
great
mountain
to
repeal
large
codes
of
fraud
and
woe
not
understood
by

but
which
the

that

and
fiery

the
torpor
of
the
year
when
feeble
dreams
visit
the
hidden

or
dreamless
sleep
holds
every
future
leaf
and
flower
bound
with
which
from
that
detested
trance
they
leap
the
works
and
ways
of
man
their
death

power
dwells
apart
in
its
tranquillity
remote
serene
and
inaccessible
and
the
naked
countenance
of
earth
on
which
i
gaze
even
these
primæval
mountains
teach
the
adverting
mind
the
glaciers
creep
like
snakes
that
watch
their
prey
from
their
far
fountains
slow
rolling
on
there
many
a
precipice
frost
and
the
sun
in
scorn
of
mortal
power
have
piled
dome
pyramid
and
pinnacle
a
city
of
death
distinct
with
many
a
tower
and
wall
impregnable
of
beaming
ice
yet
not
a
city
but
a
flood
of
ruin
is
there
that
from
the
boundaries
of
the
sky
rolls
its
perpetual
stream
vast
pines
are
strewing
its
destined
path
or
in
the
mangled
soil
branchless
and
shattered
stand
the
rocks
drawn
down
from
yon
remotest
waste
have
overthrown
the
limits
of
the
dead
and
living
world
never
to
be
reclaimed
the
of
insects
beasts
and
birds
becomes
its
spoil
their
food
and
their
retreat
for
ever
gone
so
much
of
life
and
joy
is
lost
the
race
of
man
flies
far
in
dread
his
work
and
dwelling
vanish
like
smoke
before
the
tempest
stream
and
their
place
is
not
known
below
vast
caves
shine
in
the
rushing
torrent
restless
gleam
which
from
those
secret
chasms
in
tumult
welling
meet
in
the
vale
and
one
majestic
river
the
breath
and
blood
of
distant
lands
for
ever
rolls
its
loud
waters
to
the
ocean
waves
breathes
its
swift
vapours
to
the
circling

mont

yet
gleams
on
high
power
is
there
the
still
and
solemn
power
of
many
sights
and
many
sounds
and
much
of
life
and
death
in
the
calm
darkness
of
the
moonless
nights
in
the
lone
glare
of
day
the
snows
descend
upon
that
mountain
none
beholds
them
there
nor
when
the
flakes
burn
in
the
sinking
sun
or
the
dart
through
them
contend
silently
there
and
heap
the
snow
with
breath
rapid
and
strong
but
silently
its
home
the
voiceless
lightning
in
these
solitudes
keeps
innocently
and
like
vapour
broods
over
the
snow
the
secret
strength
of
things
which
governs
thought
and
to
the
infinite
dome
of
heaven
is
as
a
law
inhabits
thee
and
what
were
thou
and
earth
and
stars
and

if
to
the
human
mind
imaginings
silence
and
solitude
were
vacancy
