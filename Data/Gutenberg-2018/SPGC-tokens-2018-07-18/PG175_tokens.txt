in

the
author
of
this
singular
work
informs
the
reader
how
he
acquired
the
certainty
that
the
opera
ghost
really
existed
the
opera
ghost
really
existed
he
was
not
as
was
long
believed
a
creature
of
the
imagination
of
the
artists
the
superstition
of
the
managers
or
a
product
of
the
absurd
and
impressionable
brains
of
the
young
ladies
of
the
ballet
their
mothers
the
the
attendants
or
the
concierge
yes
he
existed
in
flesh
and
blood
although
he
assumed
the
complete
appearance
of
a
real
phantom
that
is
to
say
of
a
spectral
shade
when
i
began
to
ransack
the
archives
of
the
national
academy
of
music
i
was
at
once
struck
by
the
surprising
coincidences
between
the
phenomena
ascribed
to
the
ghost
and
the
most
extraordinary
and
fantastic
tragedy
that
ever
excited
the
paris
upper
classes
and
i
soon
conceived
the
idea
that
this
tragedy
might
reasonably
be
explained
by
the
phenomena
in
question
the
events
do
not
date
more
than
thirty
years
back
and
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
at
the
present
day
in
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
old
men
of
the
highest
respectability
men
upon
whose
word
one
could
absolutely
rely
who
would
remember
as
though
they
happened
yesterday
the
mysterious
and
dramatic
conditions
that
attended
the
kidnapping
of
christine
daae
the
disappearance
of
the
vicomte
de
chagny
and
the
death
of
his
elder
brother
count
philippe
whose
body
was
found
on
the
bank
of
the
lake
that
exists
in
the
lower
cellars
of
the
opera
on
the
side
but
none
of
those
witnesses
had
until
that
day
thought
that
there
was
any
reason
for
connecting
the
more
or
less
legendary
figure
of
the
opera
ghost
with
that
terrible
story
the
truth
was
slow
to
enter
my
mind
puzzled
by
an
inquiry
that
at
every
moment
was
complicated
by
events
which
at
first
sight
might
be
looked
upon
as
superhuman
and
more
than
once
i
was
within
an
ace
of
abandoning
a
task
in
which
i
was
exhausting
myself
in
the
hopeless
pursuit
of
a
vain
image
at
last
i
received
the
proof
that
my
presentiments
had
not
deceived
me
and
i
was
rewarded
for
all
my
efforts
on
the
day
when
i
acquired
the
certainty
that
the
opera
ghost
was
more
than
a
mere
shade
on
that
day
i
had
spent
long
hours
over
the
memoirs
of
a
manager
the
light
and
frivolous
work
of
the
moncharmin
who
during
his
term
at
the
opera
understood
nothing
of
the
mysterious
behavior
of
the
ghost
and
who
was
making
all
the
fun
of
it
that
he
could
at
the
very
moment
when
he
became
the
first
victim
of
the
curious
financial
operation
that
went
on
inside
the
magic
envelope
i
had
just
left
the
library
in
despair
when
i
met
the
delightful
of
our
national
academy
who
stood
chatting
on
a
landing
with
a
lively
and
little
old
man
to
whom
he
introduced
me
gaily
the
knew
all
about
my
investigations
and
how
eagerly
and
unsuccessfully
i
had
been
trying
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
the
examining
magistrate
in
the
famous
chagny
case
faure
nobody
knew
what
had
become
of
him
alive
or
dead
and
here
he
was
back
from
canada
where
he
had
spent
fifteen
years
and
the
first
thing
he
had
done
on
his
return
to
paris
was
to
come
to
the
secretarial
offices
at
the
opera
and
ask
for
a
free
seat
the
little
old
man
was
faure
himself
we
spent
a
good
part
of
the
evening
together
and
he
told
me
the
whole
chagny
case
as
he
had
understood
it
at
the
time
he
was
bound
to
conclude
in
favor
of
the
madness
of
the
viscount
and
the
accidental
death
of
the
elder
brother
for
lack
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
but
he
was
nevertheless
persuaded
that
a
terrible
tragedy
had
taken
place
between
the
two
brothers
in
connection
with
christine
daae
he
could
not
tell
me
what
became
of
christine
or
the
viscount
when
i
mentioned
the
ghost
he
only
laughed
he
too
had
been
told
of
the
curious
manifestations
that
seemed
to
point
to
the
existence
of
an
abnormal
being
residing
in
one
of
the
most
mysterious
corners
of
the
opera
and
he
knew
the
story
of
the
envelope
but
he
had
never
seen
anything
in
it
worthy
of
his
attention
as
magistrate
in
charge
of
the
chagny
case
and
it
was
as
much
as
he
had
done
to
listen
to
the
evidence
of
a
witness
who
appeared
of
his
own
accord
and
declared
that
he
had
often
met
the
ghost
this
witness
was
none
other
than
the
man
whom
all
paris
called
the
persian
and
who
was
to
every
subscriber
to
the
opera
the
magistrate
took
him
for
a
visionary
i
was
immensely
interested
by
this
story
of
the
persian
i
wanted
if
there
were
still
time
to
find
this
valuable
and
eccentric
witness
my
luck
began
to
improve
and
i
discovered
him
in
his
little
flat
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
where
he
had
lived
ever
since
and
where
he
died
five
months
after
my
visit
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
be
suspicious
but
when
the
persian
had
told
me
with
candor
all
that
he
knew
about
the
ghost
and
had
handed
me
the
proofs
of
the
existence
including
the
strange
correspondence
of
christine
daae
to
do
as
i
pleased
with
i
was
no
longer
able
to
doubt
no
the
ghost
was
not
a
myth
i
have
i
know
been
told
that
this
correspondence
may
have
been
forged
from
first
to
last
by
a
man
whose
imagination
had
certainly
been
fed
on
the
most
seductive
tales
but
fortunately
i
discovered
some
of
christine
writing
outside
the
famous
bundle
of
letters
and
on
a
comparison
between
the
two
all
my
doubts
were
removed
i
also
went
into
the
past
history
of
the
persian
and
found
that
he
was
an
upright
man
incapable
of
inventing
a
story
that
might
have
defeated
the
ends
of
justice
this
moreover
was
the
opinion
of
the
more
serious
people
who
at
one
time
or
other
were
mixed
up
in
the
chagny
case
who
were
friends
of
the
chagny
family
to
whom
i
showed
all
my
documents
and
set
forth
all
my
inferences
in
this
connection
i
should
like
to
print
a
few
lines
which
i
received
from
general
d
sir
i
can
not
urge
you
too
strongly
to
publish
the
results
of
your
inquiry
i
remember
perfectly
that
a
few
weeks
before
the
disappearance
of
that
great
singer
christine
daae
and
the
tragedy
which
threw
the
whole
of
the
faubourg
into
mourning
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
on
the
subject
of
the
ghost
and
i
believe
that
it
only
ceased
to
be
discussed
in
consequence
of
the
later
affair
that
excited
us
all
so
greatly
but
if
it
be
possible
as
after
hearing
you
i
believe
to
explain
the
tragedy
through
the
ghost
then
i
beg
you
sir
to
talk
to
us
about
the
ghost
again
mysterious
though
the
ghost
may
at
first
appear
he
will
always
be
more
easily
explained
than
the
dismal
story
in
which
malevolent
people
have
tried
to
picture
two
brothers
killing
each
other
who
had
worshiped
each
other
all
their
lives
believe
me
etc
lastly
with
my
bundle
of
papers
in
hand
i
once
more
went
over
the
ghost
vast
domain
the
huge
building
which
he
had
made
his
kingdom
all
that
my
eyes
saw
all
that
my
mind
perceived
corroborated
the
persian
documents
precisely
and
a
wonderful
discovery
crowned
my
labors
in
a
very
definite
fashion
it
will
be
remembered
that
later
when
digging
in
the
substructure
of
the
opera
before
burying
the
phonographic
records
of
the
artist
voice
the
workmen
laid
bare
a
corpse
well
i
was
at
once
able
to
prove
that
this
corpse
was
that
of
the
opera
ghost
i
made
the
put
this
proof
to
the
test
with
his
own
hand
and
it
is
now
a
matter
of
supreme
indifference
to
me
if
the
papers
pretend
that
the
body
was
that
of
a
victim
of
the
commune
the
wretches
who
were
massacred
under
the
commune
in
the
cellars
of
the
opera
were
not
buried
on
this
side
i
will
tell
where
their
skeletons
can
be
found
in
a
spot
not
very
far
from
that
immense
crypt
which
was
stocked
during
the
siege
with
all
sorts
of
provisions
i
came
upon
this
track
just
when
i
was
looking
for
the
remains
of
the
opera
ghost
which
i
should
never
have
discovered
but
for
the
chance
described
above
but
we
will
return
to
the
corpse
and
what
ought
to
be
done
with
it
for
the
present
i
must
conclude
this
very
necessary
introduction
by
thanking
mifroid
who
was
the
commissary
of
police
called
in
for
the
first
investigations
after
the
disappearance
of
christine
daae
remy
the
late
secretary
mercier
the
late
gabriel
the
late
and
more
particularly
mme
la
baronne
de
who
was
once
the
little
meg
of
the
story
and
who
is
not
ashamed
of
it
the
most
charming
star
of
our
admirable
corps
de
ballet
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
worthy
mme
giry
now
deceased
who
had
charge
of
the
ghost
private
box
all
these
were
of
the
greatest
assistance
to
me
and
thanks
to
them
i
shall
be
able
to
reproduce
those
hours
of
sheer
love
and
terror
in
their
smallest
details
before
the
reader
eyes
and
i
should
be
ungrateful
indeed
if
i
omitted
while
standing
on
the
threshold
of
this
dreadful
and
veracious
story
to
thank
the
present
management
the
opera
which
has
so
kindly
assisted
me
in
all
my
inquiries
and
messager
in
particular
together
with
gabion
the
and
that
most
amiable
of
men
the
architect
intrusted
with
the
preservation
of
the
building
who
did
not
hesitate
to
lend
me
the
works
of
charles
garnier
although
he
was
almost
sure
that
i
would
never
return
them
to
him
lastly
i
must
pay
a
public
tribute
to
the
generosity
of
my
friend
and
former
collaborator
j
le
croze
who
allowed
me
to
dip
into
his
splendid
theatrical
library
and
to
borrow
the
rarest
editions
of
books
by
which
he
set
great
store
gaston
leroux
chapter
i
is
it
the
ghost
it
was
the
evening
on
which
mm
debienne
and
poligny
the
managers
of
the
opera
were
giving
a
last
gala
performance
to
mark
their
retirement
suddenly
the
of
la
sorelli
one
of
the
principal
dancers
was
invaded
by
young
ladies
of
the
ballet
who
had
come
up
from
the
stage
after
dancing
polyeucte
they
rushed
in
amid
great
confusion
some
giving
vent
to
forced
and
unnatural
laughter
others
to
cries
of
terror
sorelli
who
wished
to
be
alone
for
a
moment
to
run
through
the
speech
which
she
was
to
make
to
the
resigning
managers
looked
around
angrily
at
the
mad
and
tumultuous
crowd
it
was
little
jammes
the
girl
with
the
nose
the
eyes
the
cheeks
and
the
neck
and
shoulders
who
gave
the
explanation
in
a
trembling
voice
it
the
ghost
and
she
locked
the
door
sorelli
was
fitted
up
with
official
commonplace
elegance
a
a
sofa
a
and
a
cupboard
or
two
provided
the
necessary
furniture
on
the
walls
hung
a
few
engravings
relics
of
the
mother
who
had
known
the
glories
of
the
old
opera
in
the
rue
le
peletier
portraits
of
vestris
gardel
dupont
bigottini
but
the
room
seemed
a
palace
to
the
brats
of
the
corps
de
ballet
who
were
lodged
in
common
where
they
spent
their
time
singing
quarreling
smacking
the
dressers
and
and
buying
one
another
glasses
of
cassis
beer
or
even
rhum
until
the
bell
rang
sorelli
was
very
superstitious
she
shuddered
when
she
heard
little
jammes
speak
of
the
ghost
called
her
a
silly
little
fool
and
then
as
she
was
the
first
to
believe
in
ghosts
in
general
and
the
opera
ghost
in
particular
at
once
asked
for
details
have
you
seen
him
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
now
said
little
jammes
whose
legs
were
giving
way
beneath
her
and
she
dropped
with
a
moan
into
a
chair
thereupon
little
giry
the
girl
with
eyes
black
as
sloes
hair
black
as
ink
a
swarthy
complexion
and
a
poor
little
skin
stretched
over
poor
little
bones
little
giry
added
if
that
the
ghost
he
very
ugly
oh
yes
cried
the
chorus
of
and
they
all
began
to
talk
together
the
ghost
had
appeared
to
them
in
the
shape
of
a
gentleman
in
who
had
suddenly
stood
before
them
in
the
passage
without
their
knowing
where
he
came
from
he
seemed
to
have
come
straight
through
the
wall
pooh
said
one
of
them
who
had
more
or
less
kept
her
head
you
see
the
ghost
everywhere
and
it
was
true
for
several
months
there
had
been
nothing
discussed
at
the
opera
but
this
ghost
in
who
stalked
about
the
building
from
top
to
bottom
like
a
shadow
who
spoke
to
nobody
to
whom
nobody
dared
speak
and
who
vanished
as
soon
as
he
was
seen
no
one
knowing
how
or
where
as
became
a
real
ghost
he
made
no
noise
in
walking
people
began
by
laughing
and
making
fun
of
this
specter
dressed
like
a
man
of
fashion
or
an
undertaker
but
the
ghost
legend
soon
swelled
to
enormous
proportions
among
the
corps
de
ballet
all
the
girls
pretended
to
have
met
this
supernatural
being
more
or
less
often
and
those
who
laughed
the
loudest
were
not
the
most
at
ease
when
he
did
not
show
himself
he
betrayed
his
presence
or
his
passing
by
accident
comic
or
serious
for
which
the
general
superstition
held
him
responsible
had
any
one
met
with
a
fall
or
suffered
a
practical
joke
at
the
hands
of
one
of
the
other
girls
or
lost
a
powderpuff
it
was
at
once
the
fault
of
the
ghost
of
the
opera
ghost
after
all
who
had
seen
him
you
meet
so
many
men
in
at
the
opera
who
are
not
ghosts
but
this
had
a
peculiarity
of
its
own
it
covered
a
skeleton
at
least
so
the
said
and
of
course
it
had
a
death
head
was
all
this
serious
the
truth
is
that
the
idea
of
the
skeleton
came
from
the
description
of
the
ghost
given
by
joseph
buquet
the
chief
who
had
really
seen
the
ghost
he
had
run
up
against
the
ghost
on
the
little
staircase
by
the
footlights
which
leads
to
the
cellars
he
had
seen
him
for
a
second
for
the
ghost
had
fled
and
to
any
one
who
cared
to
listen
to
him
he
said
he
is
extraordinarily
thin
and
his
hangs
on
a
skeleton
frame
his
eyes
are
so
deep
that
you
can
hardly
see
the
fixed
pupils
you
just
see
two
big
black
holes
as
in
a
dead
man
skull
his
skin
which
is
stretched
across
his
bones
like
a
drumhead
is
not
white
but
a
nasty
yellow
his
nose
is
so
little
worth
talking
about
that
you
ca
see
it
and
the
absence
of
that
nose
is
a
horrible
thing
to
look
at
all
the
hair
he
has
is
three
or
four
long
dark
locks
on
his
forehead
and
behind
his
ears
this
chief
was
a
serious
sober
steady
man
very
slow
at
imagining
things
his
words
were
received
with
interest
and
amazement
and
soon
there
were
other
people
to
say
that
they
too
had
met
a
man
in
with
a
death
head
on
his
shoulders
sensible
men
who
had
wind
of
the
story
began
by
saying
that
joseph
buquet
had
been
the
victim
of
a
joke
played
by
one
of
his
assistants
and
then
one
after
the
other
there
came
a
series
of
incidents
so
curious
and
so
inexplicable
that
the
very
shrewdest
people
began
to
feel
uneasy
for
instance
a
fireman
is
a
brave
fellow
he
fears
nothing
least
of
all
fire
well
the
fireman
in
question
who
had
gone
to
make
a
round
of
inspection
in
the
cellars
and
who
it
seems
had
ventured
a
little
farther
than
usual
suddenly
reappeared
on
the
stage
pale
scared
trembling
with
his
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
and
practically
fainted
in
the
arms
of
the
proud
mother
of
little
jammes
and
why
because
he
had
seen
coming
toward
him
at
the
level
of
his
head
but
without
a
body
attached
to
it
a
head
of
fire
and
as
i
said
a
fireman
is
not
afraid
of
fire
the
fireman
name
was
pampin
the
corps
de
ballet
was
flung
into
consternation
at
first
sight
this
fiery
head
in
no
way
corresponded
with
joseph
buquet
description
of
the
ghost
but
the
young
ladies
soon
persuaded
themselves
that
the
ghost
had
several
heads
which
he
changed
about
as
he
pleased
and
of
course
they
at
once
imagined
that
they
were
in
the
greatest
danger
once
a
fireman
did
not
hesitate
to
faint
leaders
and
and
girls
alike
had
plenty
of
excuses
for
the
fright
that
made
them
quicken
their
pace
when
passing
some
dark
corner
or
corridor
sorelli
herself
on
the
day
after
the
adventure
of
the
fireman
placed
a
horseshoe
on
the
table
in
front
of
the
box
which
every
one
who
entered
the
opera
otherwise
than
as
a
spectator
must
touch
before
setting
foot
on
the
first
tread
of
the
staircase
this
was
not
invented
by
me
any
more
than
any
other
part
of
this
story
alas
and
may
still
be
seen
on
the
table
in
the
passage
outside
the
box
when
you
enter
the
opera
through
the
court
known
as
the
cour
de
to
return
to
the
evening
in
question
it
the
ghost
little
jammes
had
cried
an
agonizing
silence
now
reigned
in
the
nothing
was
heard
but
the
hard
breathing
of
the
girls
at
last
jammes
flinging
herself
upon
the
farthest
corner
of
the
wall
with
every
mark
of
real
terror
on
her
face
whispered
listen
everybody
seemed
to
hear
a
rustling
outside
the
door
there
was
no
sound
of
footsteps
it
was
like
light
silk
sliding
over
the
panel
then
it
stopped
sorelli
tried
to
show
more
pluck
than
the
others
she
went
up
to
the
door
and
in
a
quavering
voice
asked
who
there
but
nobody
answered
then
feeling
all
eyes
upon
her
watching
her
last
movement
she
made
an
effort
to
show
courage
and
said
very
loudly
is
there
any
one
behind
the
door
oh
yes
yes
of
course
there
is
cried
that
little
dried
plum
of
a
meg
giry
heroically
holding
sorelli
back
by
her
gauze
skirt
whatever
you
do
do
open
the
door
oh
lord
do
open
the
door
but
sorelli
armed
with
a
dagger
that
never
left
her
turned
the
key
and
drew
back
the
door
while
the
retreated
to
the
inner
and
meg
giry
sighed
mother
mother
sorelli
looked
into
the
passage
bravely
it
was
empty
a
in
its
glass
prison
cast
a
red
and
suspicious
light
into
the
surrounding
darkness
without
succeeding
in
dispelling
it
and
the
dancer
slammed
the
door
again
with
a
deep
sigh
no
she
said
there
is
no
one
there
still
we
saw
him
jammes
declared
returning
with
timid
little
steps
to
her
place
beside
sorelli
he
must
be
somewhere
prowling
about
i
sha
go
back
to
dress
we
had
better
all
go
down
to
the
foyer
together
at
once
for
the
and
we
will
come
up
again
together
and
the
child
reverently
touched
the
little
coral
which
she
wore
as
a
charm
against
bad
luck
while
sorelli
stealthily
with
the
tip
of
her
pink
right
made
a
andrew
cross
on
the
wooden
ring
which
adorned
the
fourth
finger
of
her
left
hand
she
said
to
the
little
come
children
pull
yourselves
together
i
dare
say
no
one
has
ever
seen
the
ghost
yes
yes
we
saw
him
we
saw
him
just
now
cried
the
girls
he
had
his
death
head
and
his
just
as
when
he
appeared
to
joseph
buquet
and
gabriel
saw
him
too
said
jammes
only
yesterday
yesterday
afternoon
in
broad
gabriel
the
why
yes
did
you
know
and
he
was
wearing
his
in
broad
daylight
who
gabriel
why
no
the
ghost
certainly
gabriel
told
me
so
himself
that
what
he
knew
him
by
gabriel
was
in
the
office
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
the
persian
entered
you
know
the
persian
has
the
evil
eye
oh
yes
answered
the
little
in
chorus
warding
off
by
pointing
their
forefinger
and
little
finger
at
the
absent
persian
while
their
second
and
third
fingers
were
bent
on
the
palm
and
held
down
by
the
thumb
and
you
know
how
superstitious
gabriel
is
continued
jammes
however
he
is
always
polite
when
he
meets
the
persian
he
just
puts
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
touches
his
keys
well
the
moment
the
persian
appeared
in
the
doorway
gabriel
gave
one
jump
from
his
chair
to
the
lock
of
the
cupboard
so
as
to
touch
iron
in
doing
so
he
tore
a
whole
skirt
of
his
overcoat
on
a
nail
hurrying
to
get
out
of
the
room
he
banged
his
forehead
against
a
and
gave
himself
a
huge
bump
then
suddenly
stepping
back
he
skinned
his
arm
on
the
screen
near
the
piano
he
tried
to
lean
on
the
piano
but
the
lid
fell
on
his
hands
and
crushed
his
fingers
he
rushed
out
of
the
office
like
a
madman
slipped
on
the
staircase
and
came
down
the
whole
of
the
first
flight
on
his
back
i
was
just
passing
with
mother
we
picked
him
up
he
was
covered
with
bruises
and
his
face
was
all
over
blood
we
were
frightened
out
of
our
lives
but
all
at
once
he
began
to
thank
providence
that
he
had
got
off
so
cheaply
then
he
told
us
what
had
frightened
him
he
had
seen
the
ghost
behind
the
persian
the
ghost
with
the
death
head
just
like
joseph
buquet
description
jammes
had
told
her
story
ever
so
quickly
as
though
the
ghost
were
at
her
heels
and
was
quite
out
of
breath
at
the
finish
a
silence
followed
while
sorelli
polished
her
nails
in
great
excitement
it
was
broken
by
little
giry
who
said
joseph
buquet
would
do
better
to
hold
his
tongue
why
should
he
hold
his
tongue
asked
somebody
that
mother
opinion
replied
meg
lowering
her
voice
and
looking
all
about
her
as
though
fearing
lest
other
ears
than
those
present
might
overhear
and
why
is
it
your
mother
opinion
hush
mother
says
the
ghost
does
like
being
talked
about
and
why
does
your
mother
say
so
because
because
nothing
this
reticence
exasperated
the
curiosity
of
the
young
ladies
who
crowded
round
little
giry
begging
her
to
explain
herself
they
were
there
side
by
side
leaning
forward
simultaneously
in
one
movement
of
entreaty
and
fear
communicating
their
terror
to
one
another
taking
a
keen
pleasure
in
feeling
their
blood
freeze
in
their
veins
i
swore
not
to
tell
gasped
meg
but
they
left
her
no
peace
and
promised
to
keep
the
secret
until
meg
burning
to
say
all
she
knew
began
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
well
it
because
of
the
private
box
what
private
box
the
ghost
box
has
the
ghost
a
box
oh
do
tell
us
do
tell
us
not
so
loud
said
meg
it
box
five
you
know
the
box
on
the
grand
tier
next
to
the
on
the
left
oh
nonsense
i
tell
you
it
is
mother
has
charge
of
it
but
you
swear
you
say
a
word
of
course
of
course
well
that
the
ghost
box
no
one
has
had
it
for
over
a
month
except
the
ghost
and
orders
have
been
given
at
the
that
it
must
never
be
sold
and
does
the
ghost
really
come
there
yes
then
somebody
does
come
why
no
the
ghost
comes
but
there
is
nobody
there
the
little
exchanged
glances
if
the
ghost
came
to
the
box
he
must
be
seen
because
he
wore
a
and
a
death
head
this
was
what
they
tried
to
make
meg
understand
but
she
replied
that
just
it
the
ghost
is
not
seen
and
he
has
no
and
no
head
all
that
talk
about
his
death
head
and
his
head
of
fire
is
nonsense
there
nothing
in
it
you
only
hear
him
when
he
is
in
the
box
mother
has
never
seen
him
but
she
has
heard
him
mother
knows
because
she
gives
him
his
program
sorelli
interfered
giry
child
you
getting
at
us
thereupon
little
giry
began
to
cry
i
ought
to
have
held
my
tongue
if
mother
ever
came
to
know
but
i
was
quite
right
joseph
buquet
had
no
business
to
talk
of
things
that
do
concern
him
it
will
bring
him
bad
luck
mother
was
saying
so
last
night
there
was
a
sound
of
hurried
and
heavy
footsteps
in
the
passage
and
a
breathless
voice
cried
cecile
cecile
are
you
there
it
mother
voice
said
jammes
what
the
matter
she
opened
the
door
a
respectable
lady
built
on
the
lines
of
a
pomeranian
grenadier
burst
into
the
and
dropped
groaning
into
a
vacant
her
eyes
rolled
madly
in
her
colored
face
how
awful
she
said
how
awful
what
what
joseph
buquet
what
about
him
joseph
buquet
is
dead
the
room
became
filled
with
exclamations
with
astonished
outcries
with
scared
requests
for
explanations
yes
he
was
found
hanging
in
the
cellar
it
the
ghost
little
giry
blurted
as
though
in
spite
of
herself
but
she
at
once
corrected
herself
with
her
hands
pressed
to
her
mouth
no
no
i
did
say
it
i
did
say
it
all
around
her
her
companions
repeated
under
their
breaths
yes
it
must
be
the
ghost
sorelli
was
very
pale
i
shall
never
be
able
to
recite
my
speech
she
said
ma
jammes
gave
her
opinion
while
she
emptied
a
glass
of
liqueur
that
happened
to
be
standing
on
a
table
the
ghost
must
have
something
to
do
with
it
the
truth
is
that
no
one
ever
knew
how
joseph
buquet
met
his
death
the
verdict
at
the
inquest
was
natural
suicide
in
his
memoirs
of
manager
moncharmin
one
of
the
joint
managers
who
succeeded
mm
debienne
and
poligny
describes
the
incident
as
follows
a
grievous
accident
spoiled
the
little
party
which
mm
debienne
and
poligny
gave
to
celebrate
their
retirement
i
was
in
the
office
when
mercier
the
suddenly
came
darting
in
he
seemed
half
mad
and
told
me
that
the
body
of
a
had
been
found
hanging
in
the
third
cellar
under
the
stage
between
a
and
a
scene
from
the
roi
de
lahore
i
shouted
and
cut
him
down
by
the
time
i
had
rushed
down
the
staircase
and
the
jacob
ladder
the
man
was
no
longer
hanging
from
his
rope
so
this
is
an
event
which
moncharmin
thinks
natural
a
man
hangs
at
the
end
of
a
rope
they
go
to
cut
him
down
the
rope
has
disappeared
oh
moncharmin
found
a
very
simple
explanation
listen
to
him
it
was
just
after
the
ballet
and
leaders
and
lost
no
time
in
taking
their
precautions
against
the
evil
eye
there
you
are
picture
the
corps
de
ballet
scuttling
down
the
ladder
and
dividing
the
suicide
rope
among
themselves
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
when
on
the
other
hand
i
think
of
the
exact
spot
where
the
body
was
discovered
the
third
cellar
underneath
the
stage
imagine
that
somebody
must
have
been
interested
in
seeing
that
the
rope
disappeared
after
it
had
effected
its
purpose
and
time
will
show
if
i
am
wrong
the
horrid
news
soon
spread
all
over
the
opera
where
joseph
buquet
was
very
popular
the
emptied
and
the
crowding
around
sorelli
like
timid
sheep
around
their
shepherdess
made
for
the
foyer
through
the
passages
and
staircases
trotting
as
fast
as
their
little
pink
legs
could
carry
them
i
have
the
anecdote
which
is
quite
authentic
from
pedro
gailhard
himself
the
late
manager
of
the
opera
chapter
ii
the
new
margarita
on
the
first
landing
sorelli
ran
against
the
comte
de
chagny
who
was
coming
the
count
who
was
generally
so
calm
seemed
greatly
excited
i
was
just
going
to
you
he
said
taking
off
his
hat
oh
sorelli
what
an
evening
and
christine
daae
what
a
triumph
impossible
said
meg
giry
six
months
ago
she
used
to
sing
like
a
crock
but
do
let
us
get
by
my
dear
count
continues
the
brat
with
a
saucy
curtsey
we
are
going
to
inquire
after
a
poor
man
who
was
found
hanging
by
the
neck
just
then
the
came
fussing
past
and
stopped
when
he
heard
this
remark
what
he
exclaimed
roughly
have
you
girls
heard
already
well
please
forget
about
it
for
tonight
and
above
all
do
let
debienne
and
poligny
hear
it
would
upset
them
too
much
on
their
last
day
they
all
went
on
to
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
which
was
already
full
of
people
the
comte
de
chagny
was
right
no
gala
performance
ever
equalled
this
one
all
the
great
composers
of
the
day
had
conducted
their
own
works
in
turns
faure
and
krauss
had
sung
and
on
that
evening
christine
daae
had
revealed
her
true
self
for
the
first
time
to
the
astonished
and
enthusiastic
audience
gounod
had
conducted
the
funeral
march
of
a
marionnette
reyer
his
beautiful
overture
to
siguar
saint
saens
the
danse
macabre
and
a
reverie
orientale
massenet
an
unpublished
hungarian
march
guiraud
his
carnaval
delibes
the
valse
lente
from
sylvia
and
the
pizzicati
from
coppelia
mlle
krauss
had
sung
the
bolero
in
the
vespri
siciliani
and
mlle
denise
bloch
the
drinking
song
in
lucrezia
borgia
but
the
real
triumph
was
reserved
for
christine
daae
who
had
begun
by
singing
a
few
passages
from
romeo
and
juliet
it
was
the
first
time
that
the
young
artist
sang
in
this
work
of
gounod
which
had
not
been
transferred
to
the
opera
and
which
was
revived
at
the
opera
comique
after
it
had
been
produced
at
the
old
theatre
lyrique
by
mme
carvalho
those
who
heard
her
say
that
her
voice
in
these
passages
was
seraphic
but
this
was
nothing
to
the
superhuman
notes
that
she
gave
forth
in
the
prison
scene
and
the
final
trio
in
faust
which
she
sang
in
the
place
of
la
carlotta
who
was
no
one
had
ever
heard
or
seen
anything
like
it
daae
revealed
a
new
margarita
that
night
a
margarita
of
a
splendor
a
radiance
hitherto
unsuspected
the
whole
house
went
mad
rising
to
its
feet
shouting
cheering
clapping
while
christine
sobbed
and
fainted
in
the
arms
of
her
and
had
to
be
carried
to
her
a
few
subscribers
however
protested
why
had
so
great
a
treasure
been
kept
from
them
all
that
time
till
then
christine
daae
had
played
a
good
siebel
to
carlotta
rather
too
splendidly
material
margarita
and
it
had
needed
carlotta
incomprehensible
and
inexcusable
absence
from
this
gala
night
for
the
little
daae
at
a
moment
warning
to
show
all
that
she
could
do
in
a
part
of
the
program
reserved
for
the
spanish
diva
well
what
the
subscribers
wanted
to
know
was
why
had
debienne
and
poligny
applied
to
daae
when
carlotta
was
taken
ill
did
they
know
of
her
hidden
genius
and
if
they
knew
of
it
why
had
they
kept
it
hidden
and
why
had
she
kept
it
hidden
oddly
enough
she
was
not
known
to
have
a
professor
of
singing
at
that
moment
she
had
often
said
she
meant
to
practise
alone
for
the
future
the
whole
thing
was
a
mystery
the
comte
de
chagny
standing
up
in
his
box
listened
to
all
this
frenzy
and
took
part
in
it
by
loudly
applauding
philippe
georges
marie
comte
de
chagny
was
just
years
of
age
he
was
a
great
aristocrat
and
a
man
above
middle
height
and
with
attractive
features
in
spite
of
his
hard
forehead
and
his
rather
cold
eyes
he
was
exquisitely
polite
to
the
women
and
a
little
haughty
to
the
men
who
did
not
always
forgive
him
for
his
successes
in
society
he
had
an
excellent
heart
and
an
irreproachable
conscience
on
the
death
of
old
count
philibert
he
became
the
head
of
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
distinguished
families
in
france
whose
arms
dated
back
to
the
fourteenth
century
the
chagnys
owned
a
great
deal
of
property
and
when
the
old
count
who
was
a
widower
died
it
was
no
easy
task
for
philippe
to
accept
the
management
of
so
large
an
estate
his
two
sisters
and
his
brother
raoul
would
not
hear
of
a
division
and
waived
their
claim
to
their
shares
leaving
themselves
entirely
in
hands
as
though
the
right
of
primogeniture
had
never
ceased
to
exist
when
the
two
sisters
married
on
the
same
day
they
received
their
portion
from
their
brother
not
as
a
thing
rightfully
belonging
to
them
but
as
a
dowry
for
which
they
thanked
him
the
comtesse
de
chagny
nee
de
moerogis
de
la
martyniere
had
died
in
giving
birth
to
raoul
who
was
born
twenty
years
after
his
elder
brother
at
the
time
of
the
old
count
death
raoul
was
twelve
years
of
age
philippe
busied
himself
actively
with
the
education
he
was
admirably
assisted
in
this
work
first
by
his
sisters
and
afterward
by
an
old
aunt
the
widow
of
a
naval
officer
who
lived
at
brest
and
gave
young
raoul
a
taste
for
the
sea
the
lad
entered
the
borda
finished
his
course
with
honors
and
quietly
made
his
trip
round
the
world
thanks
to
powerful
influence
he
had
just
been
appointed
a
member
of
the
official
expedition
on
board
the
requin
which
was
to
be
sent
to
the
arctic
circle
in
search
of
the
survivors
of
the
expedition
of
whom
nothing
had
been
heard
for
three
years
meanwhile
he
was
enjoying
a
long
furlough
which
would
not
be
over
for
six
months
and
already
the
dowagers
of
the
faubourg
were
pitying
the
handsome
and
apparently
delicate
stripling
for
the
hard
work
in
store
for
him
the
shyness
of
the
i
was
almost
saying
his
innocence
was
remarkable
he
seemed
to
have
but
just
left
the
women
as
a
matter
of
fact
petted
as
he
was
by
his
two
sisters
and
his
old
aunt
he
had
retained
from
this
purely
feminine
education
manners
that
were
almost
candid
and
stamped
with
a
charm
that
nothing
had
yet
been
able
to
sully
he
was
a
little
over
years
of
age
and
looked
eighteen
he
had
a
small
fair
mustache
beautiful
blue
eyes
and
a
complexion
like
a
girl
philippe
spoiled
raoul
to
begin
with
he
was
very
proud
of
him
and
pleased
to
foresee
a
glorious
career
for
his
junior
in
the
navy
in
which
one
of
their
ancestors
the
famous
chagny
de
la
roche
had
held
the
rank
of
admiral
he
took
advantage
of
the
young
man
leave
of
absence
to
show
him
paris
with
all
its
luxurious
and
artistic
delights
the
count
considered
that
at
raoul
age
it
is
not
good
to
be
too
good
philippe
himself
had
a
character
that
was
very
in
work
and
pleasure
alike
his
demeanor
was
always
faultless
and
he
was
incapable
of
setting
his
brother
a
bad
example
he
took
him
with
him
wherever
he
went
he
even
introduced
him
to
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
i
know
that
the
count
was
said
to
be
on
terms
with
sorelli
but
it
could
hardly
be
reckoned
as
a
crime
for
this
nobleman
a
bachelor
with
plenty
of
leisure
especially
since
his
sisters
were
settled
to
come
and
spend
an
hour
or
two
after
dinner
in
the
company
of
a
dancer
who
though
not
so
very
very
witty
had
the
finest
eyes
that
ever
were
seen
and
besides
there
are
places
where
a
true
parisian
when
he
has
the
rank
of
the
comte
de
chagny
is
bound
to
show
himself
and
at
that
time
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
at
the
opera
was
one
of
those
places
lastly
philippe
would
perhaps
not
have
taken
his
brother
behind
the
scenes
of
the
opera
if
raoul
had
not
been
the
first
to
ask
him
repeatedly
renewing
his
request
with
a
gentle
obstinacy
which
the
count
remembered
at
a
later
date
on
that
evening
philippe
after
applauding
the
daae
turned
to
raoul
and
saw
that
he
was
quite
pale
do
you
see
said
raoul
that
the
woman
fainting
you
look
like
fainting
yourself
said
the
count
what
the
matter
but
raoul
had
recovered
himself
and
was
standing
up
let
go
and
see
he
said
she
never
sang
like
that
before
the
count
gave
his
brother
a
curious
smiling
glance
and
seemed
quite
pleased
they
were
soon
at
the
door
leading
from
the
house
to
the
stage
numbers
of
subscribers
were
slowly
making
their
way
through
raoul
tore
his
gloves
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
and
philippe
had
much
too
kind
a
heart
to
laugh
at
him
for
his
impatience
but
he
now
understood
why
raoul
was
when
spoken
to
and
why
he
always
tried
to
turn
every
conversation
to
the
subject
of
the
opera
they
reached
the
stage
and
pushed
through
the
crowd
of
gentlemen
supers
and
raoul
leading
the
way
feeling
that
his
heart
no
longer
belonged
to
him
his
face
set
with
passion
while
count
philippe
followed
him
with
difficulty
and
continued
to
smile
at
the
back
of
the
stage
raoul
had
to
stop
before
the
inrush
of
the
little
troop
of
who
blocked
the
passage
which
he
was
trying
to
enter
more
than
one
chaffing
phrase
darted
from
little
lips
to
which
he
did
not
reply
and
at
last
he
was
able
to
pass
and
dived
into
the
of
a
corridor
ringing
with
the
name
of
daae
daae
the
count
was
surprised
to
find
that
raoul
knew
the
way
he
had
never
taken
him
to
christine
himself
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
raoul
must
have
gone
there
alone
while
the
count
stayed
talking
in
the
foyer
with
sorelli
who
often
asked
him
to
wait
until
it
was
her
time
to
go
on
and
sometimes
handed
him
the
little
gaiters
in
which
she
ran
down
from
her
to
preserve
the
spotlessness
of
her
satin
and
her
tights
sorelli
had
an
excuse
she
had
lost
her
mother
postponing
his
usual
visit
to
sorelli
for
a
few
minutes
the
count
followed
his
brother
down
the
passage
that
led
to
daae
and
saw
that
it
had
never
been
so
crammed
as
on
that
evening
when
the
whole
house
seemed
excited
by
her
success
and
also
by
her
fainting
fit
for
the
girl
had
not
yet
come
to
and
the
doctor
of
the
theater
had
just
arrived
at
the
moment
when
raoul
entered
at
his
heels
christine
therefore
received
the
first
aid
of
the
one
while
opening
her
eyes
in
the
arms
of
the
other
the
count
and
many
more
remained
crowding
in
the
doorway
do
you
think
doctor
that
those
gentlemen
had
better
clear
the
room
asked
raoul
coolly
there
no
breathing
here
you
quite
right
said
the
doctor
and
he
sent
every
one
away
except
raoul
and
the
maid
who
looked
at
raoul
with
eyes
of
the
most
undisguised
astonishment
she
had
never
seen
him
before
and
yet
dared
not
question
him
and
the
doctor
imagined
that
the
young
man
was
only
acting
as
he
did
because
he
had
the
right
to
the
viscount
therefore
remained
in
the
room
watching
christine
as
she
slowly
returned
to
life
while
even
the
joint
managers
debienne
and
poligny
who
had
come
to
offer
their
sympathy
and
congratulations
found
themselves
thrust
into
the
passage
among
the
crowd
of
dandies
the
comte
de
chagny
who
was
one
of
those
standing
outside
laughed
oh
the
rogue
the
rogue
and
he
added
under
his
breath
those
youngsters
with
their
airs
so
he
a
chagny
after
all
he
turned
to
go
to
sorelli
but
met
her
on
the
way
with
her
little
troop
of
trembling
as
we
have
seen
meanwhile
christine
daae
uttered
a
deep
sigh
which
was
answered
by
a
groan
she
turned
her
head
saw
raoul
and
started
she
looked
at
the
doctor
on
whom
she
bestowed
a
smile
then
at
her
maid
then
at
raoul
again
monsieur
she
said
in
a
voice
not
much
above
a
whisper
who
are
you
mademoiselle
replied
the
young
man
kneeling
on
one
knee
and
pressing
a
fervent
kiss
on
the
diva
hand
i
am
the
little
boy
who
went
into
the
sea
to
rescue
your
scarf
christine
again
looked
at
the
doctor
and
the
maid
and
all
three
began
to
laugh
raoul
turned
very
red
and
stood
up
mademoiselle
he
said
since
you
are
pleased
not
to
recognize
me
i
should
like
to
say
something
to
you
in
private
something
very
important
when
i
am
better
do
you
mind
and
her
voice
shook
you
have
been
very
good
yes
you
must
go
said
the
doctor
with
his
pleasantest
smile
leave
me
to
attend
to
mademoiselle
i
am
not
ill
now
said
christine
suddenly
with
strange
and
unexpected
energy
she
rose
and
passed
her
hand
over
her
eyelids
thank
you
doctor
i
should
like
to
be
alone
please
go
away
all
of
you
leave
me
i
feel
very
restless
this
evening
the
doctor
tried
to
make
a
short
protest
but
perceiving
the
evident
agitation
he
thought
the
best
remedy
was
not
to
thwart
her
and
he
went
away
saying
to
raoul
outside
she
is
not
herself
she
is
usually
so
gentle
then
he
said
good
night
and
raoul
was
left
alone
the
whole
of
this
part
of
the
theater
was
now
deserted
the
farewell
ceremony
was
no
doubt
taking
place
in
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
raoul
thought
that
daae
might
go
to
it
and
he
waited
in
the
silent
solitude
even
hiding
in
the
favoring
shadow
of
a
doorway
he
felt
a
terrible
pain
at
his
heart
and
it
was
of
this
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
daae
without
delay
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
the
maid
came
out
by
herself
carrying
bundles
he
stopped
her
and
asked
how
her
mistress
was
the
woman
laughed
and
said
that
she
was
quite
well
but
that
he
must
not
disturb
her
for
she
wished
to
be
left
alone
and
she
passed
on
one
idea
alone
filled
raoul
burning
brain
of
course
daae
wished
to
be
left
alone
for
him
had
he
not
told
her
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
privately
hardly
breathing
he
went
up
to
the
and
with
his
ear
to
the
door
to
catch
her
reply
prepared
to
knock
but
his
hand
dropped
he
had
heard
a
man
voice
in
the
saying
in
a
curiously
masterful
tone
christine
you
must
love
me
and
christine
voice
infinitely
sad
and
trembling
as
though
accompanied
by
tears
replied
how
can
you
talk
like
that
when
i
sing
only
for
you
raoul
leaned
against
the
panel
to
ease
his
pain
his
heart
which
had
seemed
gone
for
ever
returned
to
his
breast
and
was
throbbing
loudly
the
whole
passage
echoed
with
its
beating
and
raoul
ears
were
deafened
surely
if
his
heart
continued
to
make
such
a
noise
they
would
hear
it
inside
they
would
open
the
door
and
the
young
man
would
be
turned
away
in
disgrace
what
a
position
for
a
chagny
to
be
caught
listening
behind
a
door
he
took
his
heart
in
his
two
hands
to
make
it
stop
the
man
voice
spoke
again
are
you
very
tired
oh
i
gave
you
my
soul
and
i
am
dead
christine
replied
your
soul
is
a
beautiful
thing
child
replied
the
grave
man
voice
and
i
thank
you
no
emperor
ever
received
so
fair
a
gift
the
angels
wept
tonight
raoul
heard
nothing
after
that
nevertheless
he
did
not
go
away
but
as
though
he
feared
lest
he
should
be
caught
he
returned
to
his
dark
corner
determined
to
wait
for
the
man
to
leave
the
room
at
one
and
the
same
time
he
had
learned
what
love
meant
and
hatred
he
knew
that
he
loved
he
wanted
to
know
whom
he
hated
to
his
great
astonishment
the
door
opened
and
christine
daae
appeared
wrapped
in
furs
with
her
face
hidden
in
a
lace
veil
alone
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
but
raoul
observed
that
she
did
not
lock
it
she
passed
him
he
did
not
even
follow
her
with
his
eyes
for
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
which
did
not
open
again
when
the
passage
was
once
more
deserted
he
crossed
it
opened
the
door
of
the
went
in
and
shut
the
door
he
found
himself
in
absolute
darkness
the
gas
had
been
turned
out
there
is
some
one
here
said
raoul
with
his
back
against
the
closed
door
in
a
quivering
voice
what
are
you
hiding
for
all
was
darkness
and
silence
raoul
heard
only
the
sound
of
his
own
breathing
he
quite
failed
to
see
that
the
indiscretion
of
his
conduct
was
exceeding
all
bounds
you
sha
leave
this
until
i
let
you
he
exclaimed
if
you
answer
you
are
a
coward
but
i
expose
you
and
he
struck
a
match
the
blaze
lit
up
the
room
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
raoul
first
turning
the
key
in
the
door
lit
the
he
went
into
the
opened
the
cupboards
hunted
about
felt
the
walls
with
his
moist
hands
nothing
look
here
he
said
aloud
am
i
going
mad
he
stood
for
ten
minutes
listening
to
the
gas
flaring
in
the
silence
of
the
empty
room
lover
though
he
was
he
did
not
even
think
of
stealing
a
ribbon
that
would
have
given
him
the
perfume
of
the
woman
he
loved
he
went
out
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
nor
where
he
was
going
at
a
given
moment
in
his
wayward
progress
an
icy
draft
struck
him
in
the
face
he
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
a
staircase
down
which
behind
him
a
procession
of
workmen
were
carrying
a
sort
of
stretcher
covered
with
a
white
sheet
which
is
the
way
out
please
he
asked
of
one
of
the
men
straight
in
front
of
you
the
door
is
open
but
let
us
pass
pointing
to
the
stretcher
he
asked
mechanically
what
that
the
workmen
answered
is
joseph
buquet
who
was
found
in
the
third
cellar
hanging
between
a
and
a
scene
from
the
roi
de
lahore
he
took
off
his
hat
fell
back
to
make
room
for
the
procession
and
went
out
chapter
iii
the
mysterious
reason
during
this
time
the
farewell
ceremony
was
taking
place
i
have
already
said
that
this
magnificent
function
was
being
given
on
the
occasion
of
the
retirement
of
debienne
and
poligny
who
had
determined
to
die
game
as
we
say
nowadays
they
had
been
assisted
in
the
realization
of
their
ideal
though
melancholy
program
by
all
that
counted
in
the
social
and
artistic
world
of
paris
all
these
people
met
after
the
performance
in
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
where
sorelli
waited
for
the
arrival
of
the
retiring
managers
with
a
glass
of
champagne
in
her
hand
and
a
little
prepared
speech
at
the
tip
of
her
tongue
behind
her
the
members
of
the
corps
de
ballet
young
and
old
discussed
the
events
of
the
day
in
whispers
or
exchanged
discreet
signals
with
their
friends
a
noisy
crowd
of
whom
surrounded
the
arranged
along
the
slanting
floor
a
few
of
the
dancers
had
already
changed
into
ordinary
dress
but
most
of
them
wore
their
skirts
of
gossamer
gauze
and
all
had
thought
it
the
right
thing
to
put
on
a
special
face
for
the
occasion
all
that
is
except
little
jammes
whose
fifteen
summers
happy
age
seemed
already
to
have
forgotten
the
ghost
and
the
death
of
joseph
buquet
she
never
ceased
to
laugh
and
chatter
to
hop
about
and
play
practical
jokes
until
mm
debienne
and
poligny
appeared
on
the
steps
of
the
foyer
when
she
was
severely
called
to
order
by
the
impatient
sorelli
everybody
remarked
that
the
retiring
managers
looked
cheerful
as
is
the
paris
way
none
will
ever
be
a
true
parisian
who
has
not
learned
to
wear
a
mask
of
gaiety
over
his
sorrows
and
one
of
sadness
boredom
or
indifference
over
his
inward
joy
you
know
that
one
of
your
friends
is
in
trouble
do
not
try
to
console
him
he
will
tell
you
that
he
is
already
comforted
but
should
he
have
met
with
good
fortune
be
careful
how
you
congratulate
him
he
thinks
it
so
natural
that
he
is
surprised
that
you
should
speak
of
it
in
paris
our
lives
are
one
masked
ball
and
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
is
the
last
place
in
which
two
men
so
knowing
as
debienne
and
poligny
would
have
made
the
mistake
of
betraying
their
grief
however
genuine
it
might
be
and
they
were
already
smiling
rather
too
broadly
upon
sorelli
who
had
begun
to
recite
her
speech
when
an
exclamation
from
that
little
madcap
of
a
jammes
broke
the
smile
of
the
managers
so
brutally
that
the
expression
of
distress
and
dismay
that
lay
beneath
it
became
apparent
to
all
eyes
the
opera
ghost
jammes
yelled
these
words
in
a
tone
of
unspeakable
terror
and
her
finger
pointed
among
the
crowd
of
dandies
to
a
face
so
pallid
so
lugubrious
and
so
ugly
with
two
such
deep
black
cavities
under
the
straddling
eyebrows
that
the
death
head
in
question
immediately
scored
a
huge
success
the
opera
ghost
the
opera
ghost
everybody
laughed
and
pushed
his
neighbor
and
wanted
to
offer
the
opera
ghost
a
drink
but
he
was
gone
he
had
slipped
through
the
crowd
and
the
others
vainly
hunted
for
him
while
two
old
gentlemen
tried
to
calm
little
jammes
and
while
little
giry
stood
screaming
like
a
peacock
sorelli
was
furious
she
had
not
been
able
to
finish
her
speech
the
managers
had
kissed
her
thanked
her
and
run
away
as
fast
as
the
ghost
himself
no
one
was
surprised
at
this
for
it
was
known
that
they
were
to
go
through
the
same
ceremony
on
the
floor
above
in
the
foyer
of
the
singers
and
that
finally
they
were
themselves
to
receive
their
personal
friends
for
the
last
time
in
the
great
lobby
outside
the
managers
office
where
a
regular
supper
would
be
served
here
they
found
the
new
managers
armand
moncharmin
and
firmin
richard
whom
they
hardly
knew
nevertheless
they
were
lavish
in
protestations
of
friendship
and
received
a
thousand
flattering
compliments
in
reply
so
that
those
of
the
guests
who
had
feared
that
they
had
a
rather
tedious
evening
in
store
for
them
at
once
put
on
brighter
faces
the
supper
was
almost
gay
and
a
particularly
clever
speech
of
the
representative
of
the
government
mingling
the
glories
of
the
past
with
the
successes
of
the
future
caused
the
greatest
cordiality
to
prevail
the
retiring
managers
had
already
handed
over
to
their
successors
the
two
tiny
which
opened
all
the
doors
thousands
of
doors
of
the
opera
house
and
those
little
keys
the
object
of
general
curiosity
were
being
passed
from
hand
to
hand
when
the
attention
of
some
of
the
guests
was
diverted
by
their
discovery
at
the
end
of
the
table
of
that
strange
wan
and
fantastic
face
with
the
hollow
eyes
which
had
already
appeared
in
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
and
been
greeted
by
little
jammes
exclamation
the
opera
ghost
there
sat
the
ghost
as
natural
as
could
be
except
that
he
neither
ate
nor
drank
those
who
began
by
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
ended
by
turning
away
their
heads
for
the
sight
of
him
at
once
provoked
the
most
funereal
thoughts
no
one
repeated
the
joke
of
the
foyer
no
one
exclaimed
there
the
opera
ghost
he
himself
did
not
speak
a
word
and
his
very
neighbors
could
not
have
stated
at
what
precise
moment
he
had
sat
down
between
them
but
every
one
felt
that
if
the
dead
did
ever
come
and
sit
at
the
table
of
the
living
they
could
not
cut
a
more
ghastly
figure
the
friends
of
firmin
richard
and
armand
moncharmin
thought
that
this
lean
and
skinny
guest
was
an
acquaintance
of
debienne
or
poligny
while
and
poligny
friends
believed
that
the
cadaverous
individual
belonged
to
firmin
richard
and
armand
moncharmin
party
the
result
was
that
no
request
was
made
for
an
explanation
no
unpleasant
remark
no
joke
in
bad
taste
which
might
have
offended
this
visitor
from
the
tomb
a
few
of
those
present
who
knew
the
story
of
the
ghost
and
the
description
of
him
given
by
the
chief
they
did
not
know
of
joseph
buquet
death
thought
in
their
own
minds
that
the
man
at
the
end
of
the
table
might
easily
have
passed
for
him
and
yet
according
to
the
story
the
ghost
had
no
nose
and
the
person
in
question
had
but
moncharmin
declares
in
his
memoirs
that
the
guest
nose
was
transparent
long
thin
and
transparent
are
his
exact
words
i
for
my
part
will
add
that
this
might
very
well
apply
to
a
false
nose
moncharmin
may
have
taken
for
transparency
what
was
only
shininess
everybody
knows
that
orthopaedic
science
provides
beautiful
false
noses
for
those
who
have
lost
their
noses
naturally
or
as
the
result
of
an
operation
did
the
ghost
really
take
a
seat
at
the
managers
that
night
uninvited
and
can
we
be
sure
that
the
figure
was
that
of
the
opera
ghost
himself
who
would
venture
to
assert
as
much
i
mention
the
incident
not
because
i
wish
for
a
second
to
make
the
reader
believe
or
even
to
try
to
make
him
believe
that
the
ghost
was
capable
of
such
a
sublime
piece
of
impudence
but
because
after
all
the
thing
is
impossible
armand
moncharmin
in
chapter
eleven
of
his
memoirs
says
when
i
think
of
this
first
evening
i
can
not
separate
the
secret
confided
to
us
by
mm
debienne
and
poligny
in
their
office
from
the
presence
at
our
supper
of
that
ghostly
person
whom
none
of
us
knew
what
happened
was
this
mm
debienne
and
poligny
sitting
at
the
center
of
the
table
had
not
seen
the
man
with
the
death
head
suddenly
he
began
to
speak
the
are
right
he
said
the
death
of
that
poor
buquet
is
perhaps
not
so
natural
as
people
think
debienne
and
poligny
gave
a
start
is
buquet
dead
they
cried
yes
replied
the
man
or
the
shadow
of
a
man
quietly
he
was
found
this
evening
hanging
in
the
third
cellar
between
a
and
a
scene
from
the
roi
de
lahore
the
two
managers
or
rather
at
once
rose
and
stared
strangely
at
the
speaker
they
were
more
excited
than
they
need
have
been
that
is
to
say
more
excited
than
any
one
need
be
by
the
announcement
of
the
suicide
of
a
chief
they
looked
at
each
other
they
had
both
turned
whiter
than
the
at
last
debienne
made
a
sign
to
mm
richard
and
moncharmin
poligny
muttered
a
few
words
of
excuse
to
the
guests
and
all
four
went
into
the
managers
office
i
leave
moncharmin
to
complete
the
story
in
his
memoirs
he
says
mm
debienne
and
poligny
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
excited
and
they
appeared
to
have
something
very
difficult
to
tell
us
first
they
asked
us
if
we
knew
the
man
sitting
at
the
end
of
the
table
who
had
told
them
of
the
death
of
joseph
buquet
and
when
we
answered
in
the
negative
they
looked
still
more
concerned
they
took
the
from
our
hands
stared
at
them
for
a
moment
and
advised
us
to
have
new
locks
made
with
the
greatest
secrecy
for
the
rooms
closets
and
presses
that
we
might
wish
to
have
hermetically
closed
they
said
this
so
funnily
that
we
began
to
laugh
and
to
ask
if
there
were
thieves
at
the
opera
they
replied
that
there
was
something
worse
which
was
the
ghost
we
began
to
laugh
again
feeling
sure
that
they
were
indulging
in
some
joke
that
was
intended
to
crown
our
little
entertainment
then
at
their
request
we
became
resolving
to
humor
them
and
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
game
they
told
us
that
they
never
would
have
spoken
to
us
of
the
ghost
if
they
had
not
received
formal
orders
from
the
ghost
himself
to
ask
us
to
be
pleasant
to
him
and
to
grant
any
request
that
he
might
make
however
in
their
relief
at
leaving
a
domain
where
that
tyrannical
shade
held
sway
they
had
hesitated
until
the
last
moment
to
tell
us
this
curious
story
which
our
skeptical
minds
were
certainly
not
prepared
to
entertain
but
the
announcement
of
the
death
of
joseph
buquet
had
served
them
as
a
brutal
reminder
that
whenever
they
had
disregarded
the
ghost
wishes
some
fantastic
or
disastrous
event
had
brought
them
to
a
sense
of
their
dependence
during
these
unexpected
utterances
made
in
a
tone
of
the
most
secret
and
important
confidence
i
looked
at
richard
richard
in
his
student
days
had
acquired
a
great
reputation
for
practical
joking
and
he
seemed
to
relish
the
dish
which
was
being
served
up
to
him
in
his
turn
he
did
not
miss
a
morsel
of
it
though
the
seasoning
was
a
little
gruesome
because
of
the
death
of
buquet
he
nodded
his
head
sadly
while
the
others
spoke
and
his
features
assumed
the
air
of
a
man
who
bitterly
regretted
having
taken
over
the
opera
now
that
he
knew
that
there
was
a
ghost
mixed
up
in
the
business
i
could
think
of
nothing
better
than
to
give
him
a
servile
imitation
of
this
attitude
of
despair
however
in
spite
of
all
our
efforts
we
could
not
at
the
finish
help
bursting
out
laughing
in
the
faces
of
mm
debienne
and
poligny
who
seeing
us
pass
straight
from
the
gloomiest
state
of
mind
to
one
of
the
most
insolent
merriment
acted
as
though
they
thought
that
we
had
gone
mad
the
joke
became
a
little
tedious
and
richard
asked
and
half
in
jest
after
all
what
does
this
ghost
of
yours
want
poligny
went
to
his
desk
and
returned
with
a
copy
of
the
the
begins
with
the
words
saying
that
management
of
the
opera
shall
give
to
the
performance
of
the
national
academy
of
music
the
splendor
that
becomes
the
first
lyric
stage
in
france
and
ends
with
clause
which
says
that
the
privilege
can
be
withdrawn
if
the
manager
infringes
the
conditions
stipulated
in
the
this
is
followed
by
the
conditions
which
are
four
in
number
the
copy
produced
by
poligny
was
written
in
black
ink
and
exactly
similar
to
that
in
our
possession
except
that
at
the
end
it
contained
a
paragraph
in
red
ink
and
in
a
queer
labored
handwriting
as
though
it
had
been
produced
by
dipping
the
heads
of
matches
into
the
ink
the
writing
of
a
child
that
has
never
got
beyond
the
and
has
not
learned
to
join
its
letters
this
paragraph
ran
word
for
word
as
follows
or
if
the
manager
in
any
month
delay
for
more
than
a
fortnight
the
payment
of
the
allowance
which
he
shall
make
to
the
opera
ghost
an
allowance
of
twenty
thousand
francs
a
month
say
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
poligny
pointed
with
a
hesitating
finger
to
this
last
clause
which
we
certainly
did
not
expect
this
all
does
he
not
want
anything
else
asked
richard
with
the
greatest
coolness
he
does
replied
poligny
and
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
the
until
he
came
to
the
clause
specifying
the
days
on
which
certain
private
boxes
were
to
be
reserved
for
the
free
use
of
the
president
of
the
republic
the
ministers
and
so
on
at
the
end
of
this
clause
a
line
had
been
added
also
in
red
ink
five
on
the
grand
tier
shall
be
placed
at
the
disposal
of
the
opera
ghost
for
every
performance
when
we
saw
this
there
was
nothing
else
for
us
to
do
but
to
rise
from
our
chairs
shake
our
two
predecessors
warmly
by
the
hand
and
congratulate
them
on
thinking
of
this
charming
little
joke
which
proved
that
the
old
french
sense
of
humor
was
never
likely
to
become
extinct
richard
added
that
he
now
understood
why
mm
debienne
and
poligny
were
retiring
from
the
management
of
the
national
academy
of
music
business
was
impossible
with
so
unreasonable
a
ghost
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
are
not
be
picked
up
for
the
asking
said
poligny
without
moving
a
muscle
of
his
face
have
you
considered
what
the
loss
over
box
five
meant
to
us
we
did
not
sell
it
once
and
not
only
that
but
we
had
to
return
the
subscription
why
it
awful
we
really
ca
work
to
keep
ghosts
we
prefer
to
go
away
echoed
debienne
prefer
to
go
away
let
us
go
and
he
stood
up
richard
said
after
all
all
it
seems
to
me
that
you
were
much
too
kind
to
the
ghost
if
i
had
such
a
troublesome
ghost
as
that
i
should
not
hesitate
to
have
him
arrested
how
where
they
cried
in
chorus
have
never
seen
him
when
he
comes
to
his
box
have
never
seen
him
in
his
box
sell
it
the
opera
ghost
box
well
gentlemen
try
it
thereupon
we
all
four
left
the
office
richard
and
i
had
laughed
so
much
in
our
lives
chapter
iv
box
five
armand
moncharmin
wrote
such
voluminous
memoirs
during
the
fairly
long
period
of
his
that
we
may
well
ask
if
he
ever
found
time
to
attend
to
the
affairs
of
the
opera
otherwise
than
by
telling
what
went
on
there
moncharmin
did
not
know
a
note
of
music
but
he
called
the
minister
of
education
and
fine
arts
by
his
christian
name
had
dabbled
a
little
in
society
journalism
and
enjoyed
a
considerable
private
income
lastly
he
was
a
charming
fellow
and
showed
that
he
was
not
lacking
in
intelligence
for
as
soon
as
he
made
up
his
mind
to
be
a
sleeping
partner
in
the
opera
he
selected
the
best
possible
active
manager
and
went
straight
to
firmin
richard
firmin
richard
was
a
very
distinguished
composer
who
had
published
a
number
of
successful
pieces
of
all
kinds
and
who
liked
nearly
every
form
of
music
and
every
sort
of
musician
clearly
therefore
it
was
the
duty
of
every
sort
of
musician
to
like
firmin
richard
the
only
things
to
be
said
against
him
were
that
he
was
rather
masterful
in
his
ways
and
endowed
with
a
very
hasty
temper
the
first
few
days
which
the
partners
spent
at
the
opera
were
given
over
to
the
delight
of
finding
themselves
the
head
of
so
magnificent
an
enterprise
and
they
had
forgotten
all
about
that
curious
fantastic
story
of
the
ghost
when
an
incident
occurred
that
proved
to
them
that
the
joke
if
joke
it
were
was
not
over
firmin
richard
reached
his
office
that
morning
at
eleven
his
secretary
remy
showed
him
half
a
dozen
letters
which
he
had
not
opened
because
they
were
marked
private
one
of
the
letters
had
at
once
attracted
attention
not
only
because
the
envelope
was
addressed
in
red
ink
but
because
he
seemed
to
have
seen
the
writing
before
he
soon
remembered
that
it
was
the
red
handwriting
in
which
the
had
been
so
curiously
completed
he
recognized
the
clumsy
childish
hand
he
opened
the
letter
and
read
dear
mr
manager
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
trouble
you
at
a
time
when
you
must
be
so
very
busy
renewing
important
engagements
signing
fresh
ones
and
generally
displaying
your
excellent
taste
i
know
what
you
have
done
for
carlotta
sorelli
and
little
jammes
and
for
a
few
others
whose
admirable
qualities
of
talent
or
genius
you
have
suspected
of
course
when
i
use
these
words
i
do
not
mean
to
apply
them
to
la
carlotta
who
sings
like
a
squirt
and
who
ought
never
to
have
been
allowed
to
leave
the
ambassadeurs
and
the
cafe
jacquin
nor
to
la
sorelli
who
owes
her
success
mainly
to
the
nor
to
little
jammes
who
dances
like
a
calf
in
a
field
and
i
am
not
speaking
of
christine
daae
either
though
her
genius
is
certain
whereas
your
jealousy
prevents
her
from
creating
any
important
part
when
all
is
said
you
are
free
to
conduct
your
little
business
as
you
think
best
are
you
not
all
the
same
i
should
like
to
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
you
have
not
yet
turned
christine
daae
out
of
doors
by
hearing
her
this
evening
in
the
part
of
siebel
as
that
of
margarita
has
been
forbidden
her
since
her
triumph
of
the
other
evening
and
i
will
ask
you
not
to
dispose
of
my
box
nor
on
the
following
days
for
i
can
not
end
this
letter
without
telling
you
how
disagreeably
surprised
i
have
been
once
or
twice
to
hear
on
arriving
at
the
opera
that
my
box
had
been
sold
at
the
by
your
orders
i
did
not
protest
first
because
i
dislike
scandal
and
second
because
i
thought
that
your
predecessors
mm
debienne
and
poligny
who
were
always
charming
to
me
had
neglected
before
leaving
to
mention
my
little
fads
to
you
i
have
now
received
a
reply
from
those
gentlemen
to
my
letter
asking
for
an
explanation
and
this
reply
proves
that
you
know
all
about
my
and
consequently
that
you
are
treating
me
with
outrageous
contempt
if
you
wish
to
live
in
peace
you
must
not
begin
by
taking
away
my
private
box
believe
me
to
be
dear
mr
manager
without
prejudice
to
these
little
observations
your
most
humble
and
obedient
servant
opera
ghost
the
letter
was
accompanied
by
a
cutting
from
the
of
the
revue
theatrale
which
ran
there
is
no
excuse
for
and
we
told
them
and
left
your
in
their
hands
kind
regards
firmin
richard
had
hardly
finished
reading
this
letter
when
armand
moncharmin
entered
carrying
one
exactly
similar
they
looked
at
each
other
and
burst
out
laughing
they
are
keeping
up
the
joke
said
richard
but
i
do
call
it
funny
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
moncharmin
do
they
imagine
that
because
they
have
been
managers
of
the
opera
we
are
going
to
let
them
have
a
box
for
an
indefinite
period
i
am
not
in
the
mood
to
let
myself
be
laughed
at
long
said
firmin
richard
it
harmless
enough
observed
armand
moncharmin
what
is
it
they
really
want
a
box
for
firmin
richard
told
his
secretary
to
send
box
five
on
the
grand
tier
to
mm
debienne
and
poligny
if
it
was
not
sold
it
was
not
it
was
sent
off
to
them
debienne
lived
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
scribe
and
the
boulevard
des
capucines
poligny
in
the
rue
auber
ghost
two
letters
had
been
posted
at
the
boulevard
des
capucines
as
moncharmin
remarked
after
examining
the
envelopes
you
see
said
richard
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
regretted
that
two
men
of
that
age
should
amuse
themselves
with
such
childish
tricks
they
might
have
been
civil
for
all
that
said
moncharmin
did
you
notice
how
they
treat
us
with
regard
to
carlotta
sorelli
and
little
jammes
why
my
dear
fellow
these
two
are
mad
with
jealousy
to
think
that
they
went
to
the
expense
of
an
advertisement
in
the
revue
theatrale
have
they
nothing
better
to
do
by
the
way
said
moncharmin
they
seem
to
be
greatly
interested
in
that
little
christine
daae
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
she
has
the
reputation
of
being
quite
good
said
richard
reputations
are
easily
obtained
replied
moncharmin
have
i
a
reputation
for
knowing
all
about
music
and
i
do
know
one
key
from
another
do
be
afraid
you
never
had
that
reputation
richard
declared
thereupon
he
ordered
the
artists
to
be
shown
in
who
for
the
last
two
hours
had
been
walking
up
and
down
outside
the
door
behind
which
fame
and
fortune
or
dismissal
awaited
them
the
whole
day
was
spent
in
discussing
negotiating
signing
or
cancelling
contracts
and
the
two
overworked
managers
went
to
bed
early
without
so
much
as
casting
a
glance
at
box
five
to
see
whether
debienne
and
poligny
were
enjoying
the
performance
next
morning
the
managers
received
a
card
of
thanks
from
the
ghost
dear
mr
manager
thanks
charming
evening
daae
exquisite
choruses
want
waking
up
carlotta
a
splendid
commonplace
instrument
will
write
you
soon
for
the
francs
or
fr
to
be
correct
mm
debienne
and
poligny
have
sent
me
the
fr
representing
the
first
ten
days
of
my
allowance
for
the
current
year
their
privileges
finished
on
the
evening
of
the
tenth
inst
kind
regards
on
the
other
hand
there
was
a
letter
from
mm
debienne
and
poligny
gentlemen
we
are
much
obliged
for
your
kind
thought
of
us
but
you
will
easily
understand
that
the
prospect
of
again
hearing
faust
pleasant
though
it
is
to
of
the
opera
can
not
make
us
forget
that
we
have
no
right
to
occupy
box
five
on
the
grand
tier
which
is
the
exclusive
property
of
him
of
whom
we
spoke
to
you
when
we
went
through
the
with
you
for
the
last
time
see
clause
final
paragraph
accept
gentlemen
etc
oh
those
fellows
are
beginning
to
annoy
me
shouted
firmin
richard
snatching
up
the
letter
and
that
evening
box
five
was
sold
the
next
morning
mm
richard
and
moncharmin
on
reaching
their
office
found
an
inspector
report
relating
to
an
incident
that
had
happened
the
night
before
in
box
five
i
give
the
essential
part
of
the
report
i
was
obliged
to
call
in
a
municipal
guard
twice
this
evening
to
clear
box
five
on
the
grand
tier
once
at
the
beginning
and
once
in
the
middle
of
the
second
act
the
occupants
who
arrived
as
the
curtain
rose
on
the
second
act
created
a
regular
scandal
by
their
laughter
and
their
ridiculous
observations
there
were
cries
of
hush
all
around
them
and
the
whole
house
was
beginning
to
protest
when
the
came
to
fetch
me
i
entered
the
box
and
said
what
i
thought
necessary
the
people
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
in
their
right
mind
and
they
made
stupid
remarks
i
said
that
if
the
noise
was
repeated
i
should
be
compelled
to
clear
the
box
the
moment
i
left
i
heard
the
laughing
again
with
fresh
protests
from
the
house
i
returned
with
a
municipal
guard
who
turned
them
out
they
protested
still
laughing
saying
they
would
not
go
unless
they
had
their
money
back
at
last
they
became
quiet
and
i
allowed
them
to
enter
the
box
again
the
laughter
at
once
recommenced
and
this
time
i
had
them
turned
out
definitely
send
for
the
inspector
said
richard
to
his
secretary
who
had
already
read
the
report
and
marked
it
with
blue
pencil
remy
the
secretary
had
foreseen
the
order
and
called
the
inspector
at
once
tell
us
what
happened
said
richard
bluntly
the
inspector
began
to
splutter
and
referred
to
the
report
well
but
what
were
those
people
laughing
at
asked
moncharmin
they
must
have
been
dining
sir
and
seemed
more
inclined
to
lark
about
than
to
listen
to
good
music
the
moment
they
entered
the
box
they
came
out
again
and
called
the
who
asked
them
what
they
wanted
they
said
in
the
box
there
no
one
there
is
there
said
the
woman
said
they
we
went
in
we
heard
a
voice
saying
that
the
box
was
taken
moncharmin
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
looked
at
richard
but
richard
did
not
smile
he
himself
had
done
too
much
in
that
way
in
his
time
not
to
recognize
in
the
inspector
story
all
the
marks
of
one
of
those
practical
jokes
which
begin
by
amusing
and
end
by
enraging
the
victims
the
inspector
to
curry
favor
with
moncharmin
who
was
smiling
thought
it
best
to
give
a
smile
too
a
most
unfortunate
smile
richard
glared
at
his
subordinate
who
thenceforth
made
it
his
business
to
display
a
face
of
utter
consternation
however
when
the
people
arrived
roared
richard
there
was
no
one
in
the
box
was
there
not
a
soul
sir
not
a
soul
nor
in
the
box
on
the
right
nor
in
the
box
on
the
left
not
a
soul
sir
i
swear
the
told
it
me
often
enough
which
proves
that
it
was
all
a
joke
oh
you
agree
do
you
said
richard
you
agree
it
a
joke
and
you
think
it
funny
no
doubt
i
think
it
in
very
bad
taste
sir
and
what
did
the
say
oh
she
just
said
that
it
was
the
opera
ghost
that
all
she
said
and
the
inspector
grinned
but
he
soon
found
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
grinning
for
the
words
had
no
sooner
left
his
mouth
than
richard
from
gloomy
became
furious
send
for
the
he
shouted
send
for
her
this
minute
this
minute
and
bring
her
in
to
me
here
and
turn
all
those
people
out
the
inspector
tried
to
protest
but
richard
closed
his
mouth
with
an
angry
order
to
hold
his
tongue
then
when
the
wretched
man
lips
seemed
shut
for
ever
the
manager
commanded
him
to
open
them
once
more
who
is
this
ghost
he
snarled
but
the
inspector
was
by
this
time
incapable
of
speaking
a
word
he
managed
to
convey
by
a
despairing
gesture
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
or
rather
that
he
did
not
wish
to
know
have
you
ever
seen
him
have
you
seen
the
opera
ghost
the
inspector
by
means
of
a
vigorous
shake
of
the
head
denied
ever
having
seen
the
ghost
in
question
very
well
said
richard
coldly
the
inspector
eyes
started
out
of
his
head
as
though
to
ask
why
the
manager
had
uttered
that
ominous
very
well
because
i
going
to
settle
the
account
of
any
one
who
has
not
seen
him
explained
the
manager
as
he
seems
to
be
everywhere
i
have
people
telling
me
that
they
see
him
nowhere
i
like
people
to
work
for
me
when
i
employ
them
having
said
this
richard
paid
no
attention
to
the
inspector
and
discussed
various
matters
of
business
with
his
who
had
entered
the
room
meanwhile
the
inspector
thought
he
could
go
and
was
gently
oh
so
gently
sidling
toward
the
door
when
richard
nailed
the
man
to
the
floor
with
a
thundering
stay
where
you
are
remy
had
sent
for
the
to
the
rue
de
provence
close
to
the
opera
where
she
was
engaged
as
a
porteress
she
soon
made
her
appearance
what
your
name
mme
giry
you
know
me
well
enough
sir
i
the
mother
of
little
giry
little
meg
what
this
was
said
in
so
rough
and
solemn
a
tone
that
for
a
moment
richard
was
impressed
he
looked
at
mme
giry
in
her
faded
shawl
her
worn
shoes
her
old
taffeta
dress
and
dingy
bonnet
it
was
quite
evident
from
the
manager
attitude
that
he
either
did
not
know
or
could
not
remember
having
met
mme
giry
nor
even
little
giry
nor
even
little
meg
but
mme
giry
pride
was
so
great
that
the
celebrated
imagined
that
everybody
knew
her
never
heard
of
her
the
manager
declared
but
that
no
reason
mme
giry
why
i
should
ask
you
what
happened
last
night
to
make
you
and
the
inspector
call
in
a
municipal
guard
i
was
just
wanting
to
see
you
sir
and
talk
to
you
about
it
so
that
you
might
have
the
same
unpleasantness
as
debienne
and
poligny
they
would
listen
to
me
either
at
first
i
not
asking
you
about
all
that
i
asking
what
happened
last
night
mme
giry
turned
purple
with
indignation
never
had
she
been
spoken
to
like
that
she
rose
as
though
to
go
gathering
up
the
folds
of
her
skirt
and
waving
the
feathers
of
her
dingy
bonnet
with
dignity
but
changing
her
mind
she
sat
down
again
and
said
in
a
haughty
voice
i
tell
you
what
happened
the
ghost
was
annoyed
again
thereupon
as
richard
was
on
the
point
of
bursting
out
moncharmin
interfered
and
conducted
the
interrogatory
whence
it
appeared
that
mme
giry
thought
it
quite
natural
that
a
voice
should
be
heard
to
say
that
a
box
was
taken
when
there
was
nobody
in
the
box
she
was
unable
to
explain
this
phenomenon
which
was
not
new
to
her
except
by
the
intervention
of
the
ghost
nobody
could
see
the
ghost
in
his
box
but
everybody
could
hear
him
she
had
often
heard
him
and
they
could
believe
her
for
she
always
spoke
the
truth
they
could
ask
debienne
and
poligny
and
anybody
who
knew
her
and
also
isidore
saack
who
had
had
a
leg
broken
by
the
ghost
indeed
said
moncharmin
interrupting
her
did
the
ghost
break
poor
isidore
saack
leg
mme
giry
opened
her
eyes
with
astonishment
at
such
ignorance
however
she
consented
to
enlighten
those
two
poor
innocents
the
thing
had
happened
in
debienne
and
poligny
time
also
in
box
five
and
also
during
a
performance
of
faust
mme
giry
coughed
cleared
her
throat
it
sounded
as
though
she
were
preparing
to
sing
the
whole
of
gounod
score
and
began
it
was
like
this
sir
that
night
maniera
and
his
lady
the
jewelers
in
the
rue
mogador
were
sitting
in
the
front
of
the
box
with
their
great
friend
isidore
saack
sitting
behind
mme
maniera
mephistopheles
was
singing
mme
giry
here
burst
into
song
herself
while
you
play
at
sleeping
and
then
maniera
heard
a
voice
in
his
right
ear
his
wife
was
on
his
left
saying
ha
julie
not
playing
at
sleeping
his
wife
happened
to
be
called
julie
so
maniera
turns
to
the
right
to
see
who
was
talking
to
him
like
that
nobody
there
he
rubs
his
ear
and
asks
himself
if
he
dreaming
then
mephistopheles
went
on
with
his
serenade
but
perhaps
i
boring
you
gentlemen
no
no
go
on
you
are
too
good
gentlemen
with
a
smirk
well
then
mephistopheles
went
on
with
his
serenade
mme
giry
burst
into
song
again
unclose
thy
portals
holy
and
accord
the
bliss
to
a
mortal
bending
lowly
of
a
and
then
maniera
again
hears
the
voice
in
his
right
ear
saying
this
time
ha
julie
would
mind
according
a
kiss
to
isidore
then
he
turns
round
again
but
this
time
to
the
left
and
what
do
you
think
he
sees
isidore
who
had
taken
his
lady
hand
and
was
covering
it
with
kisses
through
the
little
round
place
in
the
glove
like
this
gentlemen
rapturously
kissing
the
bit
of
palm
left
bare
in
the
middle
of
her
thread
gloves
then
they
had
a
lively
time
between
them
bang
bang
maniera
who
was
big
and
strong
like
you
richard
gave
two
blows
to
isidore
saack
who
was
small
and
weak
like
moncharmin
saving
his
presence
there
was
a
great
uproar
people
in
the
house
shouted
will
do
stop
them
he
kill
him
then
at
last
isidore
saack
managed
to
run
away
then
the
ghost
had
not
broken
his
leg
asked
moncharmin
a
little
vexed
that
his
figure
had
made
so
little
impression
on
mme
giry
he
did
break
it
for
him
sir
replied
mme
giry
haughtily
he
broke
it
for
him
on
the
grand
staircase
which
he
ran
down
too
fast
sir
and
it
will
be
long
before
the
poor
gentleman
will
be
able
to
go
up
it
again
did
the
ghost
tell
you
what
he
said
in
maniera
right
ear
asked
moncharmin
with
a
gravity
which
he
thought
exceedingly
humorous
no
sir
it
was
maniera
himself
so
but
you
have
spoken
to
the
ghost
my
good
lady
as
i
speaking
to
you
now
my
good
sir
mme
giry
replied
and
when
the
ghost
speaks
to
you
what
does
he
say
well
he
tells
me
to
bring
him
a
footstool
this
time
richard
burst
out
laughing
as
did
moncharmin
and
remy
the
secretary
only
the
inspector
warned
by
experience
was
careful
not
to
laugh
while
mme
giry
ventured
to
adopt
an
attitude
that
was
positively
threatening
instead
of
laughing
she
cried
indignantly
you
do
better
to
do
as
poligny
did
who
found
out
for
himself
found
out
about
what
asked
moncharmin
who
had
never
been
so
much
amused
in
his
life
about
the
ghost
of
course
look
here
she
suddenly
calmed
herself
feeling
that
this
was
a
solemn
moment
in
her
life
look
here
she
repeated
they
were
playing
la
juive
poligny
thought
he
would
watch
the
performance
from
the
ghost
box
well
when
leopold
cries
us
fly
you
know
and
eleazer
stops
them
and
says
go
ye
well
poligny
i
was
watching
him
from
the
back
of
the
next
box
which
was
empty
poligny
got
up
and
walked
out
quite
stiffly
like
a
statue
and
before
i
had
time
to
ask
him
go
ye
like
eleazer
he
was
down
the
staircase
but
without
breaking
his
leg
still
that
does
let
us
know
how
the
opera
ghost
came
to
ask
you
for
a
footstool
insisted
moncharmin
well
from
that
evening
no
one
tried
to
take
the
ghost
private
box
from
him
the
manager
gave
orders
that
he
was
to
have
it
at
each
performance
and
whenever
he
came
he
asked
me
for
a
footstool
tut
tut
a
ghost
asking
for
a
footstool
then
this
ghost
of
yours
is
a
woman
no
the
ghost
is
a
man
how
do
you
know
he
has
a
man
voice
oh
such
a
lovely
man
voice
this
is
what
happens
when
he
comes
to
the
opera
it
usually
in
the
middle
of
the
first
act
he
gives
three
little
taps
on
the
door
of
box
five
the
first
time
i
heard
those
three
taps
when
i
knew
there
was
no
one
in
the
box
you
can
think
how
puzzled
i
was
i
opened
the
door
listened
looked
nobody
and
then
i
heard
a
voice
say
jules
my
poor
husband
name
was
jules
footstool
please
saving
your
presence
gentlemen
it
made
me
feel
like
but
the
voice
went
on
be
frightened
mme
jules
i
the
opera
ghost
and
the
voice
was
so
soft
and
kind
that
i
hardly
felt
frightened
the
voice
was
sitting
in
the
corner
chair
on
the
right
in
the
front
row
was
there
any
one
in
the
box
on
the
right
of
box
five
asked
moncharmin
no
box
seven
and
box
three
the
one
on
the
left
were
both
empty
the
curtain
had
only
just
gone
up
and
what
did
you
do
well
i
brought
the
footstool
of
course
it
was
for
himself
he
wanted
it
but
for
his
lady
but
i
never
heard
her
nor
saw
her
eh
what
so
now
the
ghost
is
married
the
eyes
of
the
two
managers
traveled
from
mme
giry
to
the
inspector
who
standing
behind
the
was
waving
his
arms
to
attract
their
attention
he
tapped
his
forehead
with
a
distressful
forefinger
to
convey
his
opinion
that
the
widow
jules
giry
was
most
certainly
mad
a
piece
of
pantomime
which
confirmed
richard
in
his
determination
to
get
rid
of
an
inspector
who
kept
a
lunatic
in
his
service
meanwhile
the
worthy
lady
went
on
about
her
ghost
now
painting
his
generosity
at
the
end
of
the
performance
he
always
gives
me
two
francs
sometimes
five
sometimes
even
ten
when
he
has
been
many
days
without
coming
only
since
people
have
begun
to
annoy
him
again
he
gives
me
nothing
at
all
excuse
me
my
good
woman
said
moncharmin
while
mme
giry
tossed
the
feathers
in
her
dingy
hat
at
this
persistent
familiarity
excuse
me
how
does
the
ghost
manage
to
give
you
your
two
francs
why
he
leaves
them
on
the
little
shelf
in
the
box
of
course
i
find
them
with
the
program
which
i
always
give
him
some
evenings
i
find
flowers
in
the
box
a
rose
that
must
have
dropped
from
his
bodice
for
he
brings
a
lady
with
him
sometimes
one
day
they
left
a
fan
behind
them
oh
the
ghost
left
a
fan
did
he
and
what
did
you
do
with
it
well
i
brought
it
back
to
the
box
next
night
here
the
inspector
voice
was
raised
you
broken
the
rules
i
shall
have
to
fine
you
mme
giry
hold
your
tongue
you
fool
muttered
firmin
richard
you
brought
back
the
fan
and
then
well
then
they
took
it
away
with
them
sir
it
was
not
there
at
the
end
of
the
performance
and
in
its
place
they
left
me
a
box
of
english
sweets
which
i
very
fond
of
that
one
of
the
ghost
pretty
thoughts
that
will
do
mme
giry
you
can
go
when
mme
giry
had
bowed
herself
out
with
the
dignity
that
never
deserted
her
the
manager
told
the
inspector
that
they
had
decided
to
dispense
with
that
old
madwoman
services
and
when
he
had
gone
in
his
turn
they
instructed
the
to
make
up
the
accounts
left
alone
the
managers
told
each
other
of
the
idea
which
they
both
had
in
mind
which
was
that
they
should
look
into
that
little
matter
of
box
five
themselves
chapter
v
the
enchanted
violin
christine
daae
owing
to
intrigues
to
which
i
will
return
later
did
not
immediately
continue
her
triumph
at
the
opera
after
the
famous
gala
night
she
sang
once
at
the
duchess
de
zurich
but
this
was
the
last
occasion
on
which
she
was
heard
in
private
she
refused
without
plausible
excuse
to
appear
at
a
charity
concert
to
which
she
had
promised
her
assistance
she
acted
throughout
as
though
she
were
no
longer
the
mistress
of
her
own
destiny
and
as
though
she
feared
a
fresh
triumph
she
knew
that
the
comte
de
chagny
to
please
his
brother
had
done
his
best
on
her
behalf
with
richard
and
she
wrote
to
thank
him
and
also
to
ask
him
to
cease
speaking
in
her
favor
her
reason
for
this
curious
attitude
was
never
known
some
pretended
that
it
was
due
to
overweening
pride
others
spoke
of
her
heavenly
modesty
but
people
on
the
stage
are
not
so
modest
as
all
that
and
i
think
that
i
shall
not
be
far
from
the
truth
if
i
ascribe
her
action
simply
to
fear
yes
i
believe
that
christine
daae
was
frightened
by
what
had
happened
to
her
i
have
a
letter
of
christine
it
forms
part
of
the
collection
relating
to
this
period
which
suggests
a
feeling
of
absolute
dismay
i
do
know
myself
when
i
sing
writes
the
poor
child
she
showed
herself
nowhere
and
the
vicomte
de
chagny
tried
in
vain
to
meet
her
he
wrote
to
her
asking
to
call
upon
her
but
despaired
of
receiving
a
reply
when
one
morning
she
sent
him
the
following
note
monsieur
i
have
not
forgotten
the
little
boy
who
went
into
the
sea
to
rescue
my
scarf
i
feel
that
i
must
write
to
you
when
i
am
going
to
perros
in
fulfilment
of
a
sacred
duty
is
the
anniversary
of
the
death
of
my
poor
father
whom
you
knew
and
who
was
very
fond
of
you
he
is
buried
there
with
his
violin
in
the
graveyard
of
the
little
church
at
the
bottom
of
the
slope
where
we
used
to
play
as
children
beside
the
road
where
when
we
were
a
little
bigger
we
said
for
the
last
time
the
vicomte
de
chagny
hurriedly
consulted
a
railway
guide
dressed
as
quickly
as
he
could
wrote
a
few
lines
for
his
valet
to
take
to
his
brother
and
jumped
into
a
cab
which
brought
him
to
the
gare
montparnasse
just
in
time
to
miss
the
morning
train
he
spent
a
dismal
day
in
town
and
did
not
recover
his
spirits
until
the
evening
when
he
was
seated
in
his
compartment
in
the
brittany
express
he
read
christine
note
over
and
over
again
smelling
its
perfume
recalling
the
sweet
pictures
of
his
childhood
and
spent
the
rest
of
that
tedious
night
journey
in
feverish
dreams
that
began
and
ended
with
christine
daae
day
was
breaking
when
he
alighted
at
lannion
he
hurried
to
the
diligence
for
he
was
the
only
passenger
he
questioned
the
driver
and
learned
that
on
the
evening
of
the
previous
day
a
young
lady
who
looked
like
a
parisian
had
gone
to
perros
and
put
up
at
the
inn
known
as
the
setting
sun
the
nearer
he
drew
to
her
the
more
fondly
he
remembered
the
story
of
the
little
swedish
singer
most
of
the
details
are
still
unknown
to
the
public
there
was
once
in
a
little
not
far
from
upsala
a
peasant
who
lived
there
with
his
family
digging
the
earth
during
the
week
and
singing
in
the
choir
on
sundays
this
peasant
had
a
little
daughter
to
whom
he
taught
the
musical
alphabet
before
she
knew
how
to
read
daae
father
was
a
great
musician
perhaps
without
knowing
it
not
a
fiddler
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
scandinavia
played
as
he
did
his
reputation
was
widespread
and
he
was
always
invited
to
set
the
couples
dancing
at
weddings
and
other
festivals
his
wife
died
when
christine
was
entering
upon
her
sixth
year
then
the
father
who
cared
only
for
his
daughter
and
his
music
sold
his
patch
of
ground
and
went
to
upsala
in
search
of
fame
and
fortune
he
found
nothing
but
poverty
he
returned
to
the
country
wandering
from
fair
to
fair
strumming
his
scandinavian
melodies
while
his
child
who
never
left
his
side
listened
to
him
in
ecstasy
or
sang
to
his
playing
one
day
at
ljimby
fair
professor
valerius
heard
them
and
took
them
to
gothenburg
he
maintained
that
the
father
was
the
first
violinist
in
the
world
and
that
the
daughter
had
the
making
of
a
great
artist
her
education
and
instruction
were
provided
for
she
made
rapid
progress
and
charmed
everybody
with
her
prettiness
her
grace
of
manner
and
her
genuine
eagerness
to
please
when
valerius
and
his
wife
went
to
settle
in
france
they
took
daae
and
christine
with
them
mamma
valerius
treated
christine
as
her
daughter
as
for
daae
he
began
to
pine
away
with
homesickness
he
never
went
out
of
doors
in
paris
but
lived
in
a
sort
of
dream
which
he
kept
up
with
his
violin
for
hours
at
a
time
he
remained
locked
up
in
his
bedroom
with
his
daughter
fiddling
and
singing
very
very
softly
sometimes
mamma
valerius
would
come
and
listen
behind
the
door
wipe
away
a
tear
and
go
again
on
tiptoe
sighing
for
her
scandinavian
skies
daae
seemed
not
to
recover
his
strength
until
the
summer
when
the
whole
family
went
to
stay
at
in
a
corner
of
brittany
where
the
sea
was
of
the
same
color
as
in
his
own
country
often
he
would
play
his
saddest
tunes
on
the
beach
and
pretend
that
the
sea
stopped
its
roaring
to
listen
to
them
and
then
he
induced
mamma
valerius
to
indulge
a
queer
whim
of
his
at
the
time
of
the
pardons
or
breton
pilgrimages
the
village
festival
and
dances
he
went
off
with
his
fiddle
as
in
the
old
days
and
was
allowed
to
take
his
daughter
with
him
for
a
week
they
gave
the
smallest
hamlets
music
to
last
them
for
a
year
and
slept
at
night
in
a
barn
refusing
a
bed
at
the
inn
lying
close
together
on
the
straw
as
when
they
were
so
poor
in
sweden
at
the
same
time
they
were
very
neatly
dressed
made
no
collection
refused
the
halfpence
offered
them
and
the
people
around
could
not
understand
the
conduct
of
this
rustic
fiddler
who
tramped
the
roads
with
that
pretty
child
who
sang
like
an
angel
from
heaven
they
followed
them
from
village
to
village
one
day
a
little
boy
who
was
out
with
his
governess
made
her
take
a
longer
walk
than
he
intended
for
he
could
not
tear
himself
from
the
little
girl
whose
pure
sweet
voice
seemed
to
bind
him
to
her
they
came
to
the
shore
of
an
inlet
which
is
still
called
trestraou
but
which
now
i
believe
harbors
a
casino
or
something
of
the
sort
at
that
time
there
was
nothing
but
sky
and
sea
and
a
stretch
of
golden
beach
only
there
was
also
a
high
wind
which
blew
christine
scarf
out
to
sea
christine
gave
a
cry
and
put
out
her
arms
but
the
scarf
was
already
far
on
the
waves
then
she
heard
a
voice
say
it
all
right
i
go
and
fetch
your
scarf
out
of
the
sea
and
she
saw
a
little
boy
running
fast
in
spite
of
the
outcries
and
the
indignant
protests
of
a
worthy
lady
in
black
the
little
boy
ran
into
the
sea
dressed
as
he
was
and
brought
her
back
her
scarf
boy
and
scarf
were
both
soaked
through
the
lady
in
black
made
a
great
fuss
but
christine
laughed
merrily
and
kissed
the
little
boy
who
was
none
other
than
the
vicomte
raoul
de
chagny
staying
at
lannion
with
his
aunt
during
the
season
they
saw
each
other
and
played
together
almost
every
day
at
the
aunt
request
seconded
by
professor
valerius
daae
consented
to
give
the
young
viscount
some
violin
lessons
in
this
way
raoul
learned
to
love
the
same
airs
that
had
charmed
childhood
they
also
both
had
the
same
calm
and
dreamy
little
cast
of
mind
they
delighted
in
stories
in
old
breton
legends
and
their
favorite
sport
was
to
go
and
ask
for
them
at
the
like
beggars
or
kind
gentleman
have
you
a
little
story
to
tell
us
please
and
it
seldom
happened
that
they
did
not
have
one
given
them
for
nearly
every
old
breton
grandame
has
at
least
once
in
her
life
seen
the
korrigans
dance
by
moonlight
on
the
heather
but
their
great
treat
was
in
the
twilight
in
the
great
silence
of
the
evening
after
the
sun
had
set
in
the
sea
when
daae
came
and
sat
down
by
them
on
the
roadside
and
in
a
low
voice
as
though
fearing
lest
he
should
frighten
the
ghosts
whom
he
evoked
told
them
the
legends
of
the
land
of
the
north
and
the
moment
he
stopped
the
children
would
ask
for
more
there
was
one
story
that
began
a
king
sat
in
a
little
boat
on
one
of
those
deep
still
lakes
that
open
like
a
bright
eye
in
the
midst
of
the
norwegian
mountains
and
another
little
lotte
thought
of
everything
and
nothing
her
hair
was
golden
as
the
sun
rays
and
her
soul
as
clear
and
blue
as
her
eyes
she
wheedled
her
mother
was
kind
to
her
doll
took
great
care
of
her
frock
and
her
little
red
shoes
and
her
fiddle
but
most
of
all
loved
when
she
went
to
sleep
to
hear
the
angel
of
music
while
the
old
man
told
this
story
raoul
looked
at
christine
blue
eyes
and
golden
hair
and
christine
thought
that
lotte
was
very
lucky
to
hear
the
angel
of
music
when
she
went
to
sleep
the
angel
of
music
played
a
part
in
all
daddy
daae
tales
and
he
maintained
that
every
great
musician
every
great
artist
received
a
visit
from
the
angel
at
least
once
in
his
life
sometimes
the
angel
leans
over
their
cradle
as
happened
to
lotte
and
that
is
how
there
are
little
prodigies
who
play
the
fiddle
at
six
better
than
men
at
fifty
which
you
must
admit
is
very
wonderful
sometimes
the
angel
comes
much
later
because
the
children
are
naughty
and
wo
learn
their
lessons
or
practise
their
scales
and
sometimes
he
does
not
come
at
all
because
the
children
have
a
bad
heart
or
a
bad
conscience
no
one
ever
sees
the
angel
but
he
is
heard
by
those
who
are
meant
to
hear
him
he
often
comes
when
they
least
expect
him
when
they
are
sad
and
disheartened
then
their
ears
suddenly
perceive
celestial
harmonies
a
divine
voice
which
they
remember
all
their
lives
persons
who
are
visited
by
the
angel
quiver
with
a
thrill
unknown
to
the
rest
of
mankind
and
they
can
not
touch
an
instrument
or
open
their
mouths
to
sing
without
producing
sounds
that
put
all
other
human
sounds
to
shame
then
people
who
do
not
know
that
the
angel
has
visited
those
persons
say
that
they
have
genius
little
christine
asked
her
father
if
he
had
heard
the
angel
of
music
but
daddy
daae
shook
his
head
sadly
and
then
his
eyes
lit
up
as
he
said
you
will
hear
him
one
day
my
child
when
i
am
in
heaven
i
will
send
him
to
you
daddy
was
beginning
to
cough
at
that
time
three
years
later
raoul
and
christine
met
again
at
perros
professor
valerius
was
dead
but
his
widow
remained
in
france
with
daddy
daae
and
his
daughter
who
continued
to
play
the
violin
and
sing
wrapping
in
their
dream
of
harmony
their
kind
patroness
who
seemed
henceforth
to
live
on
music
alone
the
young
man
as
he
now
was
had
come
to
perros
on
the
chance
of
finding
them
and
went
straight
to
the
house
in
which
they
used
to
stay
he
first
saw
the
old
man
and
then
christine
entered
carrying
the
she
flushed
at
the
sight
of
raoul
who
went
up
to
her
and
kissed
her
she
asked
him
a
few
questions
performed
her
duties
as
hostess
prettily
took
up
the
tray
again
and
left
the
room
then
she
ran
into
the
garden
and
took
refuge
on
a
bench
a
prey
to
feelings
that
stirred
her
young
heart
for
the
first
time
raoul
followed
her
and
they
talked
till
the
evening
very
shyly
they
were
quite
changed
cautious
as
two
diplomatists
and
told
each
other
things
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
budding
sentiments
when
they
took
leave
of
each
other
by
the
roadside
raoul
pressing
a
kiss
on
christine
trembling
hand
said
mademoiselle
i
shall
never
forget
you
and
he
went
away
regretting
his
words
for
he
knew
that
christine
could
not
be
the
wife
of
the
vicomte
de
chagny
as
for
christine
she
tried
not
to
think
of
him
and
devoted
herself
wholly
to
her
art
she
made
wonderful
progress
and
those
who
heard
her
prophesied
that
she
would
be
the
greatest
singer
in
the
world
meanwhile
the
father
died
and
suddenly
she
seemed
to
have
lost
with
him
her
voice
her
soul
and
her
genius
she
retained
just
but
only
just
enough
of
this
to
enter
the
conservatoire
where
she
did
not
distinguish
herself
at
all
attending
the
classes
without
enthusiasm
and
taking
a
prize
only
to
please
old
mamma
valerius
with
whom
she
continued
to
live
the
first
time
that
raoul
saw
christine
at
the
opera
he
was
charmed
by
the
girl
beauty
and
by
the
sweet
images
of
the
past
which
it
evoked
but
was
rather
surprised
at
the
negative
side
of
her
art
he
returned
to
listen
to
her
he
followed
her
in
the
wings
he
waited
for
her
behind
a
jacob
ladder
he
tried
to
attract
her
attention
more
than
once
he
walked
after
her
to
the
door
of
her
box
but
she
did
not
see
him
she
seemed
for
that
matter
to
see
nobody
she
was
all
indifference
raoul
suffered
for
she
was
very
beautiful
and
he
was
shy
and
dared
not
confess
his
love
even
to
himself
and
then
came
the
of
the
gala
performance
the
heavens
torn
asunder
and
an
angel
voice
heard
upon
earth
for
the
delight
of
mankind
and
the
utter
capture
of
his
heart
and
then
and
then
there
was
that
man
voice
behind
the
door
you
must
love
me
and
no
one
in
the
room
why
did
she
laugh
when
he
reminded
her
of
the
incident
of
the
scarf
why
did
she
not
recognize
him
and
why
had
she
written
to
him
perros
was
reached
at
last
raoul
walked
into
the
smoky
of
the
setting
sun
and
at
once
saw
christine
standing
before
him
smiling
and
showing
no
astonishment
so
you
have
come
she
said
i
felt
that
i
should
find
you
here
when
i
came
back
from
mass
some
one
told
me
so
at
the
church
who
asked
raoul
taking
her
little
hand
in
his
why
my
poor
father
who
is
dead
there
was
a
silence
and
then
raoul
asked
did
your
father
tell
you
that
i
love
you
christine
and
that
i
can
not
live
without
you
christine
blushed
to
the
eyes
and
turned
away
her
head
in
a
trembling
voice
she
said
me
you
are
dreaming
my
friend
and
she
burst
out
laughing
to
put
herself
in
countenance
do
laugh
christine
i
am
quite
serious
raoul
answered
and
she
replied
gravely
i
did
not
make
you
come
to
tell
me
such
things
as
that
you
me
come
christine
you
knew
that
your
letter
would
not
leave
me
indignant
and
that
i
should
hasten
to
perros
how
can
you
have
thought
that
if
you
did
not
think
i
loved
you
i
thought
you
would
remember
our
games
here
as
children
in
which
my
father
so
often
joined
i
really
do
know
what
i
thought
perhaps
i
was
wrong
to
write
to
you
this
anniversary
and
your
sudden
appearance
in
my
room
at
the
opera
the
other
evening
reminded
me
of
the
time
long
past
and
made
me
write
to
you
as
the
little
girl
that
i
then
was
there
was
something
in
christine
attitude
that
seemed
to
raoul
not
natural
he
did
not
feel
any
hostility
in
her
far
from
it
the
distressed
affection
shining
in
her
eyes
told
him
that
but
why
was
this
affection
distressed
that
was
what
he
wished
to
know
and
what
was
irritating
him
when
you
saw
me
in
your
was
that
the
first
time
you
noticed
me
christine
she
was
incapable
of
lying
no
she
said
i
had
seen
you
several
times
in
your
brother
box
and
also
on
the
stage
i
thought
so
said
raoul
compressing
his
lips
but
then
why
when
you
saw
me
in
your
room
at
your
feet
reminding
you
that
i
had
rescued
your
scarf
from
the
sea
why
did
you
answer
as
though
you
did
not
know
me
and
also
why
did
you
laugh
the
tone
of
these
questions
was
so
rough
that
christine
stared
at
raoul
without
replying
the
young
man
himself
was
aghast
at
the
sudden
quarrel
which
he
had
dared
to
raise
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
resolved
to
speak
words
of
gentleness
love
and
submission
to
christine
a
husband
a
lover
with
all
rights
would
talk
no
differently
to
a
wife
a
mistress
who
had
offended
him
but
he
had
gone
too
far
and
saw
no
other
way
out
of
the
ridiculous
position
than
to
behave
odiously
you
do
answer
he
said
angrily
and
unhappily
well
i
will
answer
for
you
it
was
because
there
was
some
one
in
the
room
who
was
in
your
way
christine
some
one
that
you
did
not
wish
to
know
that
you
could
be
interested
in
any
one
else
if
any
one
was
in
my
way
my
friend
christine
broke
in
coldly
if
any
one
was
in
my
way
that
evening
it
was
yourself
since
i
told
you
to
leave
the
room
yes
so
that
you
might
remain
with
the
other
what
are
you
saying
monsieur
asked
the
girl
excitedly
and
to
what
other
do
you
refer
to
the
man
to
whom
you
said
sing
only
for
you
i
gave
you
my
soul
and
i
am
dead
christine
seized
raoul
arm
and
clutched
it
with
a
strength
which
no
one
would
have
suspected
in
so
frail
a
creature
then
you
were
listening
behind
the
door
yes
because
i
love
you
everything
and
i
heard
everything
you
heard
what
and
the
young
girl
becoming
strangely
calm
released
raoul
arm
he
said
to
you
you
must
love
me
at
these
words
a
deathly
pallor
spread
over
christine
face
dark
rings
formed
round
her
eyes
she
staggered
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
swooning
raoul
darted
forward
with
arms
outstretched
but
christine
had
overcome
her
passing
faintness
and
said
in
a
low
voice
go
on
go
on
tell
me
all
you
heard
at
an
utter
loss
to
understand
raoul
answered
i
heard
him
reply
when
you
said
you
had
given
him
your
soul
soul
is
a
beautiful
thing
child
and
i
thank
you
no
emperor
ever
received
so
fair
a
gift
the
angels
wept
tonight
christine
carried
her
hand
to
her
heart
a
prey
to
indescribable
emotion
her
eyes
stared
before
her
like
a
madwoman
raoul
was
but
suddenly
christine
eyes
moistened
and
two
great
tears
trickled
like
two
pearls
down
her
ivory
cheeks
christine
raoul
the
young
man
tried
to
take
her
in
his
arms
but
she
escaped
and
fled
in
great
disorder
while
christine
remained
locked
in
her
room
raoul
was
at
his
wit
end
what
to
do
he
refused
to
breakfast
he
was
terribly
concerned
and
bitterly
grieved
to
see
the
hours
which
he
had
hoped
to
find
so
sweet
slip
past
without
the
presence
of
the
young
swedish
girl
why
did
she
not
come
to
roam
with
him
through
the
country
where
they
had
so
many
memories
in
common
he
heard
that
she
had
had
a
mass
said
that
morning
for
the
repose
of
her
father
soul
and
spent
a
long
time
praying
in
the
little
church
and
on
the
fiddler
tomb
then
as
she
seemed
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
at
perros
and
in
fact
was
doing
nothing
there
why
did
she
not
go
back
to
paris
at
once
raoul
walked
away
dejectedly
to
the
graveyard
in
which
the
church
stood
and
was
indeed
alone
among
the
tombs
reading
the
inscriptions
but
when
he
turned
behind
the
apse
he
was
suddenly
struck
by
the
dazzling
note
of
the
flowers
that
straggled
over
the
white
ground
they
were
marvelous
red
roses
that
had
blossomed
in
the
morning
in
the
snow
giving
a
glimpse
of
life
among
the
dead
for
death
was
all
around
him
it
also
like
the
flowers
issued
from
the
ground
which
had
flung
back
a
number
of
its
corpses
skeletons
and
skulls
by
the
hundred
were
heaped
against
the
wall
of
the
church
held
in
position
by
a
wire
that
left
the
whole
gruesome
stack
visible
dead
men
bones
arranged
in
rows
like
bricks
to
form
the
first
course
upon
which
the
walls
of
the
sacristy
had
been
built
the
door
of
the
sacristy
opened
in
the
middle
of
that
bony
structure
as
is
often
seen
in
old
breton
churches
raoul
said
a
prayer
for
daae
and
then
painfully
impressed
by
all
those
eternal
smiles
on
the
mouths
of
skulls
he
climbed
the
slope
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
heath
overlooking
the
sea
the
wind
fell
with
the
evening
raoul
was
surrounded
by
icy
darkness
but
he
did
not
feel
the
cold
it
was
here
he
remembered
that
he
used
to
come
with
little
christine
to
see
the
korrigans
dance
at
the
rising
of
the
moon
he
had
never
seen
any
though
his
eyes
were
good
whereas
christine
who
was
a
little
shortsighted
pretended
that
she
had
seen
many
he
smiled
at
the
thought
and
then
suddenly
gave
a
start
a
voice
behind
him
said
do
you
think
the
korrigans
will
come
this
evening
it
was
christine
he
tried
to
speak
she
put
her
gloved
hand
on
his
mouth
listen
raoul
i
have
decided
to
tell
you
something
serious
very
serious
do
you
remember
the
legend
of
the
angel
of
music
i
do
indeed
he
said
i
believe
it
was
here
that
your
father
first
told
it
to
us
and
it
was
here
that
he
said
i
am
in
heaven
my
child
i
will
send
him
to
you
well
raoul
my
father
is
in
heaven
and
i
have
been
visited
by
the
angel
of
music
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
replied
the
young
man
gravely
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
friend
in
obedience
to
a
pious
thought
was
connecting
the
memory
of
her
father
with
the
brilliancy
of
her
last
triumph
christine
appeared
astonished
at
the
vicomte
de
chagny
coolness
how
do
you
understand
it
she
asked
bringing
her
pale
face
so
close
to
his
that
he
might
have
thought
that
christine
was
going
to
give
him
a
kiss
but
she
only
wanted
to
read
his
eyes
in
spite
of
the
dark
i
understand
he
said
that
no
human
being
can
sing
as
you
sang
the
other
evening
without
the
intervention
of
some
miracle
no
professor
on
earth
can
teach
you
such
accents
as
those
you
have
heard
the
angel
of
music
christine
yes
she
said
solemnly
in
my
that
is
where
he
comes
to
give
me
my
lessons
daily
in
your
he
echoed
stupidly
yes
that
is
where
i
have
heard
him
and
i
have
not
been
the
only
one
to
hear
him
who
else
heard
him
christine
you
my
friend
i
i
heard
the
angel
of
music
yes
the
other
evening
it
was
he
who
was
talking
when
you
were
listening
behind
the
door
it
was
he
who
said
must
love
me
but
i
then
thought
that
i
was
the
only
one
to
hear
his
voice
imagine
my
astonishment
when
you
told
me
this
morning
that
you
could
hear
him
too
raoul
burst
out
laughing
the
first
rays
of
the
moon
came
and
shrouded
the
two
young
people
in
their
light
christine
turned
on
raoul
with
a
hostile
air
her
eyes
usually
so
gentle
flashed
fire
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
think
you
heard
a
man
voice
i
suppose
well
replied
the
young
man
whose
ideas
began
to
grow
confused
in
the
face
of
christine
determined
attitude
it
you
raoul
who
say
that
you
an
old
playfellow
of
my
own
a
friend
of
my
father
but
you
have
changed
since
those
days
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
am
an
honest
girl
le
vicomte
de
chagny
and
i
do
lock
myself
up
in
my
with
men
voices
if
you
had
opened
the
door
you
would
have
seen
that
there
was
nobody
in
the
room
that
true
i
did
open
the
door
when
you
were
gone
and
i
found
no
one
in
the
room
so
you
see
well
the
viscount
summoned
up
all
his
courage
well
christine
i
think
that
somebody
is
making
game
of
you
she
gave
a
cry
and
ran
away
he
ran
after
her
but
in
a
tone
of
fierce
anger
she
called
out
leave
me
leave
me
and
she
disappeared
raoul
returned
to
the
inn
feeling
very
weary
very
and
very
sad
he
was
told
that
christine
had
gone
to
her
bedroom
saying
that
she
would
not
be
down
to
dinner
raoul
dined
alone
in
a
very
gloomy
mood
then
he
went
to
his
room
and
tried
to
read
went
to
bed
and
tried
to
sleep
there
was
no
sound
in
the
next
room
the
hours
passed
slowly
it
was
about
eleven
when
he
distinctly
heard
some
one
moving
with
a
light
stealthy
step
in
the
room
next
to
his
then
christine
had
not
gone
to
bed
without
troubling
for
a
reason
raoul
dressed
taking
care
not
to
make
a
sound
and
waited
waited
for
what
how
could
he
tell
but
his
heart
thumped
in
his
chest
when
he
heard
christine
door
turn
slowly
on
its
hinges
where
could
she
be
going
at
this
hour
when
every
one
was
fast
asleep
at
perros
softly
opening
the
door
he
saw
white
form
in
the
moonlight
slipping
along
the
passage
she
went
down
the
stairs
and
he
leaned
over
the
baluster
above
her
suddenly
he
heard
two
voices
in
rapid
conversation
he
caught
one
sentence
lose
the
key
it
was
the
landlady
voice
the
door
facing
the
sea
was
opened
and
locked
again
then
all
was
still
raoul
ran
back
to
his
room
and
threw
back
the
window
white
form
stood
on
the
deserted
quay
the
first
floor
of
the
setting
sun
was
at
no
great
height
and
a
tree
growing
against
the
wall
held
out
its
branches
to
raoul
impatient
arms
and
enabled
him
to
climb
down
unknown
to
the
landlady
her
amazement
therefore
was
all
the
greater
when
the
next
morning
the
young
man
was
brought
back
to
her
half
frozen
more
dead
than
alive
and
when
she
learned
that
he
had
been
found
stretched
at
full
length
on
the
steps
of
the
high
altar
of
the
little
church
she
ran
at
once
to
tell
christine
who
hurried
down
and
with
the
help
of
the
landlady
did
her
best
to
revive
him
he
soon
opened
his
eyes
and
was
not
long
in
recovering
when
he
saw
his
friend
charming
face
leaning
over
him
a
few
weeks
later
when
the
tragedy
at
the
opera
compelled
the
intervention
of
the
public
prosecutor
mifroid
the
commissary
of
police
examined
the
vicomte
de
chagny
touching
the
events
of
the
night
at
perros
i
quote
the
questions
and
answers
as
given
in
the
official
report
pp
et
seq
q
did
mlle
daae
not
see
you
come
down
from
your
room
by
the
curious
road
which
you
selected
no
monsieur
no
although
when
walking
behind
her
i
took
no
pains
to
deaden
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
in
fact
i
was
anxious
that
she
should
turn
round
and
see
me
i
realized
that
i
had
no
excuse
for
following
her
and
that
this
way
of
spying
on
her
was
unworthy
of
me
but
she
seemed
not
to
hear
me
and
acted
exactly
as
though
i
were
not
there
she
quietly
left
the
quay
and
then
suddenly
walked
quickly
up
the
road
the
had
struck
a
quarter
to
twelve
and
i
thought
that
this
must
have
made
her
hurry
for
she
began
almost
to
run
and
continued
hastening
until
she
came
to
the
church
q
was
the
gate
open
yes
monsieur
and
this
surprised
me
but
did
not
seem
to
surprise
mlle
daae
q
was
there
no
one
in
the
churchyard
i
did
not
see
any
one
and
if
there
had
been
i
must
have
seen
him
the
moon
was
shining
on
the
snow
and
made
the
night
quite
light
q
was
it
possible
for
any
one
to
hide
behind
the
tombstones
no
monsieur
they
were
quite
small
poor
tombstones
partly
hidden
under
the
snow
with
their
crosses
just
above
the
level
of
the
ground
the
only
shadows
were
those
of
the
crosses
and
ourselves
the
church
stood
out
quite
brightly
i
never
saw
so
clear
a
night
it
was
very
fine
and
very
cold
and
one
could
see
everything
q
are
you
at
all
superstitious
no
monsieur
i
am
a
practising
catholic
q
in
what
condition
of
mind
were
you
very
healthy
and
peaceful
i
assure
you
mlle
daae
curious
action
in
going
out
at
that
hour
had
worried
me
at
first
but
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
go
to
the
churchyard
i
thought
that
she
meant
to
fulfil
some
pious
duty
on
her
father
grave
and
i
considered
this
so
natural
that
i
recovered
all
my
calmness
i
was
only
surprised
that
she
had
not
heard
me
walking
behind
her
for
my
footsteps
were
quite
audible
on
the
hard
snow
but
she
must
have
been
taken
up
with
her
intentions
and
i
resolved
not
to
disturb
her
she
knelt
down
by
her
father
grave
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
began
to
pray
at
that
moment
it
struck
midnight
at
the
last
stroke
i
saw
mlle
daae
life
sic
her
eyes
to
the
sky
and
stretch
out
her
arms
as
though
in
ecstasy
i
was
wondering
what
the
reason
could
be
when
i
myself
raised
my
head
and
everything
within
me
seemed
drawn
toward
the
invisible
which
was
playing
the
most
perfect
music
christine
and
i
knew
that
music
we
had
heard
it
as
children
but
it
had
never
been
executed
with
such
divine
art
even
by
daae
i
remembered
all
that
christine
had
told
me
of
the
angel
of
music
the
air
was
the
resurrection
of
lazarus
which
old
daae
used
to
play
to
us
in
his
hours
of
melancholy
and
of
faith
if
christine
angel
had
existed
he
could
not
have
played
better
that
night
on
the
late
musician
violin
when
the
music
stopped
i
seemed
to
hear
a
noise
from
the
skulls
in
the
heap
of
bones
it
was
as
though
they
were
chuckling
and
i
could
not
help
shuddering
q
did
it
not
occur
to
you
that
the
musician
might
be
hiding
behind
that
very
heap
of
bones
it
was
the
one
thought
that
did
occur
to
me
monsieur
so
much
so
that
i
omitted
to
follow
mlle
daae
when
she
stood
up
and
walked
slowly
to
the
gate
she
was
so
much
absorbed
just
then
that
i
am
not
surprised
that
she
did
not
see
me
q
then
what
happened
that
you
were
found
in
the
morning
lying
on
the
steps
of
the
high
altar
first
a
skull
rolled
to
my
feet
then
another
then
another
it
was
as
if
i
were
the
mark
of
that
ghastly
game
of
bowls
and
i
had
an
idea
that
false
step
must
have
destroyed
the
balance
of
the
structure
behind
which
our
musician
was
concealed
this
surmise
seemed
to
be
confirmed
when
i
saw
a
shadow
suddenly
glide
along
the
sacristy
wall
i
ran
up
the
shadow
had
already
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
the
church
but
i
was
quicker
than
the
shadow
and
caught
hold
of
a
corner
of
its
cloak
at
that
moment
we
were
just
in
front
of
the
high
altar
and
the
moonbeams
fell
straight
upon
us
through
the
windows
of
the
apse
as
i
did
not
let
go
of
the
cloak
the
shadow
turned
round
and
i
saw
a
terrible
death
head
which
darted
a
look
at
me
from
a
pair
of
scorching
eyes
i
felt
as
if
i
were
face
to
face
with
satan
and
in
the
presence
of
this
unearthly
apparition
my
heart
gave
way
my
courage
failed
me
and
i
remember
nothing
more
until
i
recovered
consciousness
at
the
setting
sun
chapter
vi
a
visit
to
box
five
we
left
firmin
richard
and
armand
moncharmin
at
the
moment
when
they
were
deciding
to
look
into
that
little
matter
of
box
five
leaving
behind
them
the
broad
staircase
which
leads
from
the
lobby
outside
the
managers
offices
to
the
stage
and
its
dependencies
they
crossed
the
stage
went
out
by
the
subscribers
door
and
entered
the
house
through
the
first
little
passage
on
the
left
then
they
made
their
way
through
the
front
rows
of
stalls
and
looked
at
box
five
on
the
grand
tier
they
could
not
see
it
well
because
it
was
half
in
darkness
and
because
great
covers
were
flung
over
the
red
velvet
of
the
ledges
of
all
the
boxes
they
were
almost
alone
in
the
huge
gloomy
house
and
a
great
silence
surrounded
them
it
was
the
time
when
most
of
the
go
out
for
a
drink
the
staff
had
left
the
boards
for
the
moment
leaving
a
scene
half
set
a
few
rays
of
light
a
wan
sinister
light
that
seemed
to
have
been
stolen
from
an
expiring
luminary
fell
through
some
opening
or
other
upon
an
old
tower
that
raised
its
pasteboard
battlements
on
the
stage
everything
in
this
deceptive
light
adopted
a
fantastic
shape
in
the
orchestra
stalls
the
drugget
covering
them
looked
like
an
angry
sea
whose
glaucous
waves
had
been
suddenly
rendered
stationary
by
a
secret
order
from
the
storm
phantom
who
as
everybody
knows
is
called
adamastor
mm
moncharmin
and
richard
were
the
shipwrecked
mariners
amid
this
motionless
turmoil
of
a
calico
sea
they
made
for
the
left
boxes
plowing
their
way
like
sailors
who
leave
their
ship
and
try
to
struggle
to
the
shore
the
eight
great
polished
columns
stood
up
in
the
dusk
like
so
many
huge
piles
supporting
the
threatening
crumbling
cliffs
whose
layers
were
represented
by
the
circular
parallel
waving
lines
of
the
balconies
of
the
grand
first
and
second
tiers
of
boxes
at
the
top
right
on
top
of
the
cliff
lost
in
lenepveu
copper
ceiling
figures
grinned
and
grimaced
laughed
and
jeered
at
mm
richard
and
moncharmin
distress
and
yet
these
figures
were
usually
very
serious
their
names
were
isis
amphitrite
hebe
pandora
psyche
thetis
pomona
daphne
clytie
galatea
and
arethusa
yes
arethusa
herself
and
pandora
whom
we
all
know
by
her
box
looked
down
upon
the
two
new
managers
of
the
opera
who
ended
by
clutching
at
some
piece
of
wreckage
and
from
there
stared
silently
at
box
five
on
the
grand
tier
i
have
said
that
they
were
distressed
at
least
i
presume
so
moncharmin
in
any
case
admits
that
he
was
impressed
to
quote
his
own
words
in
his
memoirs
this
moonshine
about
the
opera
ghost
in
which
since
we
first
took
over
the
duties
of
mm
poligny
and
debienne
we
had
been
so
nicely
steeped
moncharmin
style
is
not
always
irreproachable
had
no
doubt
ended
by
blinding
my
imaginative
and
also
my
visual
faculties
it
may
be
that
the
exceptional
surroundings
in
which
we
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
an
incredible
silence
impressed
us
to
an
unusual
extent
it
may
be
that
we
were
the
sport
of
a
kind
of
hallucination
brought
about
by
the
of
the
theater
and
the
partial
gloom
that
filled
box
five
at
any
rate
i
saw
and
richard
also
saw
a
shape
in
the
box
richard
said
nothing
nor
i
either
but
we
spontaneously
seized
each
other
hand
we
stood
like
that
for
some
minutes
without
moving
with
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
same
point
but
the
figure
had
disappeared
then
we
went
out
and
in
the
lobby
communicated
our
impressions
to
each
other
and
talked
about
shape
the
misfortune
was
that
my
shape
was
not
in
the
least
like
richard
i
had
seen
a
thing
like
a
death
head
resting
on
the
ledge
of
the
box
whereas
richard
saw
the
shape
of
an
old
woman
who
looked
like
mme
giry
we
soon
discovered
that
we
had
really
been
the
victims
of
an
illusion
whereupon
without
further
delay
and
laughing
like
madmen
we
ran
to
box
five
on
the
grand
tier
went
inside
and
found
no
shape
of
any
kind
box
five
is
just
like
all
the
other
grand
tier
boxes
there
is
nothing
to
distinguish
it
from
any
of
the
others
moncharmin
and
richard
ostensibly
highly
amused
and
laughing
at
each
other
moved
the
furniture
of
the
box
lifted
the
cloths
and
the
chairs
and
particularly
examined
the
in
which
the
man
voice
used
to
sit
but
they
saw
that
it
was
a
respectable
with
no
magic
about
it
altogether
the
box
was
the
most
ordinary
box
in
the
world
with
its
red
hangings
its
chairs
its
carpet
and
its
ledge
covered
in
red
velvet
after
feeling
the
carpet
in
the
most
serious
manner
possible
and
discovering
nothing
more
here
or
anywhere
else
they
went
down
to
the
corresponding
box
on
the
pit
tier
below
in
box
five
on
the
pit
tier
which
is
just
inside
the
first
exit
from
the
stalls
on
the
left
they
found
nothing
worth
mentioning
either
those
people
are
all
making
fools
of
us
firmin
richard
ended
by
exclaiming
it
will
be
faust
on
saturday
let
us
both
see
the
performance
from
box
five
on
the
grand
tier
chapter
vii
faust
and
what
followed
on
the
saturday
morning
on
reaching
their
office
the
joint
managers
found
a
letter
from
worded
in
these
terms

dear
managers

warned
in
time
look
here
i
getting
sick
of
him
sick
of
him
shouted
richard
bringing
his
fists
down
on
his
just
then
mercier
the
entered
lachenel
would
like
to
see
one
of
you
gentlemen
he
said
he
says
that
his
business
is
urgent
and
he
seems
quite
upset
who
lachenel
asked
richard
he
your
what
do
you
mean
my
yes
sir
explained
mercier
there
are
several
grooms
at
the
opera
and
lachenel
is
at
the
head
of
them
and
what
does
this
groom
do
he
has
the
chief
management
of
the
stable
what
stable
why
yours
sir
the
stable
of
the
opera
is
there
a
stable
at
the
opera
upon
my
word
i
did
know
where
is
it
in
the
cellars
on
the
rotunda
side
it
a
very
important
department
we
have
twelve
horses
twelve
horses
and
what
for
in
heaven
name
why
we
want
trained
horses
for
the
processions
in
the
juive
the
profeta
and
so
on
horses
to
the
boards
it
is
the
business
to
teach
them
lachenel
is
very
clever
at
it
he
used
to
manage
franconi
stables
very
well
but
what
does
he
want
i
do
know
i
never
saw
him
in
such
a
state
he
can
come
in
lachenel
came
in
carrying
a
with
which
he
struck
his
right
boot
in
an
irritable
manner
good
morning
lachenel
said
richard
somewhat
impressed
to
what
do
we
owe
the
honor
of
your
visit
mr
manager
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
get
rid
of
the
whole
stable
what
you
want
to
get
rid
of
our
horses
i
not
talking
of
the
horses
but
of
the
stablemen
how
many
stablemen
have
you
m
lachenel
six
stablemen
that
at
least
two
too
many
these
are
mercier
interposed
created
and
forced
upon
us
by
the
for
fine
arts
they
are
filled
by
protegees
of
the
government
and
if
i
may
venture
to
i
do
care
a
hang
for
the
government
roared
richard
we
need
more
than
four
stablemen
for
twelve
horses
eleven
said
the
head
correcting
him
twelve
repeated
richard
eleven
repeated
lachenel
oh
the
told
me
that
you
had
twelve
horses
i
did
have
twelve
but
i
have
only
eleven
since
cesar
was
stolen
and
lachenel
gave
himself
a
great
smack
on
the
boot
with
his
whip
has
cesar
been
stolen
cried
the
cesar
the
white
horse
in
the
profeta
there
are
not
two
cesars
said
the
dryly
i
was
ten
years
at
franconi
and
i
have
seen
plenty
of
horses
in
my
time
well
there
are
not
two
cesars
and
he
been
stolen
how
i
do
know
nobody
knows
that
why
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
sack
the
whole
stable
what
do
your
stablemen
say
all
sorts
of
nonsense
some
of
them
accuse
the
supers
others
pretend
that
it
the
doorkeeper
my
doorkeeper
i
answer
for
him
as
i
would
for
myself
protested
mercier
but
after
all
lachenel
cried
richard
you
must
have
some
idea
yes
i
have
lachenel
declared
i
have
an
idea
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
there
no
doubt
about
it
in
my
mind
he
walked
up
to
the
two
managers
and
whispered
it
the
ghost
who
did
the
trick
richard
gave
a
jump
what
you
too
you
too
how
do
you
mean
i
too
is
it
natural
after
what
i
saw
what
did
you
see
i
saw
as
clearly
as
i
now
see
you
a
black
shadow
riding
a
white
horse
that
was
as
like
cesar
as
two
peas
and
did
you
run
after
them
i
did
and
i
shouted
but
they
were
too
fast
for
me
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
underground
gallery
richard
rose
that
will
do
lachenel
you
can
go
we
will
lodge
a
complaint
against
the
ghost
and
sack
my
stable
oh
of
course
good
morning
lachenel
bowed
and
withdrew
richard
foamed
at
the
mouth
settle
that
idiot
account
at
once
please
he
is
a
friend
of
the
government
representative
mercier
ventured
to
say
and
he
takes
his
vermouth
at
tortoni
with
lagrene
scholl
and
pertuiset
the
added
moncharmin
we
shall
have
the
whole
press
against
us
he
tell
the
story
of
the
ghost
and
everybody
will
be
laughing
at
our
expense
we
may
as
well
be
dead
as
ridiculous
all
right
say
no
more
about
it
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
it
must
have
been
deserted
by
its
usual
cerberus
for
mme
giry
entered
without
ceremony
holding
a
letter
in
her
hand
and
said
hurriedly
i
beg
your
pardon
excuse
me
gentlemen
but
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
the
opera
ghost
he
told
me
to
come
to
you
that
you
had
something
to
she
did
not
complete
the
sentence
she
saw
firmin
richard
face
and
it
was
a
terrible
sight
he
seemed
ready
to
burst
he
said
nothing
he
could
not
speak
but
suddenly
he
acted
first
his
left
arm
seized
upon
the
quaint
person
of
mme
giry
and
made
her
describe
so
unexpected
a
semicircle
that
she
uttered
a
despairing
cry
next
his
right
foot
imprinted
its
sole
on
the
black
taffeta
of
a
skirt
which
certainly
had
never
before
undergone
a
similar
outrage
in
a
similar
place
the
thing
happened
so
quickly
that
mme
giry
when
in
the
passage
was
still
quite
bewildered
and
seemed
not
to
understand
but
suddenly
she
understood
and
the
opera
rang
with
her
indignant
yells
her
violent
protests
and
threats
about
the
same
time
carlotta
who
had
a
small
house
of
her
own
in
the
rue
du
faubourg
honore
rang
for
her
maid
who
brought
her
letters
to
her
bed
among
them
was
an
anonymous
missive
written
in
red
ink
in
a
hesitating
clumsy
hand
which
ran
if
you
appear
you
must
be
prepared
for
a
great
misfortune
at
the
moment
when
you
open
your
mouth
to
sing
a
misfortune
worse
than
death
the
letter
took
away
carlotta
appetite
for
breakfast
she
pushed
back
her
chocolate
sat
up
in
bed
and
thought
hard
it
was
not
the
first
letter
of
the
kind
which
she
had
received
but
she
never
had
one
couched
in
such
threatening
terms
she
thought
herself
at
that
time
the
victim
of
a
thousand
jealous
attempts
and
went
about
saying
that
she
had
a
secret
enemy
who
had
sworn
to
ruin
her
she
pretended
that
a
wicked
plot
was
being
hatched
against
her
a
cabal
which
would
come
to
a
head
one
of
those
days
but
she
added
that
she
was
not
the
woman
to
be
intimidated
the
truth
is
that
if
there
was
a
cabal
it
was
led
by
carlotta
herself
against
poor
christine
who
had
no
suspicion
of
it
carlotta
had
never
forgiven
christine
for
the
triumph
which
she
had
achieved
when
taking
her
place
at
a
moment
notice
when
carlotta
heard
of
the
astounding
reception
bestowed
upon
her
understudy
she
was
at
once
cured
of
an
incipient
attack
of
bronchitis
and
a
bad
fit
of
sulking
against
the
management
and
lost
the
slightest
inclination
to
shirk
her
duties
from
that
time
she
worked
with
all
her
might
to
smother
her
rival
enlisting
the
services
of
influential
friends
to
persuade
the
managers
not
to
give
christine
an
opportunity
for
a
fresh
triumph
certain
newspapers
which
had
begun
to
extol
the
talent
of
christine
now
interested
themselves
only
in
the
fame
of
carlotta
lastly
in
the
theater
itself
the
celebrated
but
heartless
and
soulless
diva
made
the
most
scandalous
remarks
about
christine
and
tried
to
cause
her
endless
minor
unpleasantnesses
when
carlotta
had
finished
thinking
over
the
threat
contained
in
the
strange
letter
she
got
up
we
shall
see
she
said
adding
a
few
oaths
in
her
native
spanish
with
a
very
determined
air
the
first
thing
she
saw
when
looking
out
of
her
window
was
a
hearse
she
was
very
superstitious
and
the
hearse
and
the
letter
convinced
her
that
she
was
running
the
most
serious
dangers
that
evening
she
collected
all
her
supporters
told
them
that
she
was
threatened
at
that
evening
performance
with
a
plot
organized
by
christine
daae
and
declared
that
they
must
play
a
trick
upon
that
chit
by
filling
the
house
with
her
carlotta
admirers
she
had
no
lack
of
them
had
she
she
relied
upon
them
to
hold
themselves
prepared
for
any
eventuality
and
to
silence
the
adversaries
if
as
she
feared
they
created
a
disturbance
richard
private
secretary
called
to
ask
after
the
diva
health
and
returned
with
the
assurance
that
she
was
perfectly
well
and
that
were
she
dying
she
would
sing
the
part
of
margarita
that
evening
the
secretary
urged
her
in
his
chief
name
to
commit
no
imprudence
to
stay
at
home
all
day
and
to
be
careful
of
drafts
and
carlotta
could
not
help
after
he
had
gone
comparing
this
unusual
and
unexpected
advice
with
the
threats
contained
in
the
letter
it
was
five
when
the
post
brought
a
second
anonymous
letter
in
the
same
hand
as
the
first
it
was
short
and
said
simply
you
have
a
bad
cold
if
you
are
wise
you
will
see
that
it
is
madness
to
try
to
sing
carlotta
sneered
shrugged
her
handsome
shoulders
and
sang
two
or
three
notes
to
reassure
herself
her
friends
were
faithful
to
their
promise
they
were
all
at
the
opera
that
night
but
looked
round
in
vain
for
the
fierce
conspirators
whom
they
were
instructed
to
suppress
the
only
unusual
thing
was
the
presence
of
richard
and
moncharmin
in
box
five
friends
thought
that
perhaps
the
managers
had
wind
on
their
side
of
the
proposed
disturbance
and
that
they
had
determined
to
be
in
the
house
so
as
to
stop
it
then
and
there
but
this
was
unjustifiable
supposition
as
the
reader
knows
richard
and
moncharmin
were
thinking
of
nothing
but
their
ghost
vain
in
vain
do
i
call
through
my
vigil
weary
on
creation
and
its
lord
never
reply
will
break
the
silence
dreary
no
sign
no
single
word
the
famous
baritone
carolus
fonta
had
hardly
finished
doctor
first
appeal
to
the
powers
of
darkness
when
firmin
richard
who
was
sitting
in
the
ghost
own
chair
the
front
chair
on
the
right
leaned
over
to
his
partner
and
asked
him
chaffingly
well
has
the
ghost
whispered
a
word
in
your
ear
yet
wait
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
replied
armand
moncharmin
in
the
same
gay
tone
the
performance
has
only
begun
and
you
know
that
the
ghost
does
not
usually
come
until
the
middle
of
the
first
act
the
first
act
passed
without
incident
which
did
not
surprise
carlotta
friends
because
margarita
does
not
sing
in
this
act
as
for
the
managers
they
looked
at
each
other
when
the
curtain
fell
that
one
said
moncharmin
yes
the
ghost
is
late
said
firmin
richard
it
not
a
bad
house
said
moncharmin
for
house
with
a
curse
on
it
richard
smiled
and
pointed
to
a
fat
rather
vulgar
woman
dressed
in
black
sitting
in
a
stall
in
the
middle
of
the
auditorium
with
a
man
in
a
broadcloth
on
either
side
of
her
who
on
earth
are
asked
moncharmin
my
dear
fellow
are
my
concierge
her
husband
and
her
brother
did
you
give
them
their
tickets
i
did
my
concierge
had
never
been
to
the
opera
this
is
the
first
time
and
as
she
is
now
going
to
come
every
night
i
wanted
her
to
have
a
good
seat
before
spending
her
time
showing
other
people
to
theirs
moncharmin
asked
what
he
meant
and
richard
answered
that
he
had
persuaded
his
concierge
in
whom
he
had
the
greatest
confidence
to
come
and
take
mme
giry
place
yes
he
would
like
to
see
if
with
that
woman
instead
of
the
old
lunatic
box
five
would
continue
to
astonish
the
natives
by
the
way
said
moncharmin
you
know
that
mother
giry
is
going
to
lodge
a
complaint
against
you
with
whom
the
ghost
the
ghost
moncharmin
had
almost
forgotten
him
however
that
mysterious
person
did
nothing
to
bring
himself
to
the
memory
of
the
managers
and
they
were
just
saying
so
to
each
other
for
the
second
time
when
the
door
of
the
box
suddenly
opened
to
admit
the
startled
what
the
matter
they
both
asked
amazed
at
seeing
him
there
at
such
a
time
it
seems
there
a
plot
got
up
by
christine
daae
friends
against
carlotta
carlotta
furious
what
on
earth
said
richard
knitting
his
brows
but
the
curtain
rose
on
the
kermess
scene
and
richard
made
a
sign
to
the
to
go
away
when
the
two
were
alone
again
moncharmin
leaned
over
to
richard
then
daae
has
friends
he
asked
yes
she
has
whom
richard
glanced
across
at
a
box
on
the
grand
tier
containing
no
one
but
two
men
the
comte
de
chagny
yes
he
spoke
to
me
in
her
favor
with
such
warmth
that
if
i
had
not
known
him
to
be
sorelli
friend
really
really
said
moncharmin
and
who
is
that
pale
young
man
beside
him
that
his
brother
the
viscount
he
ought
to
be
in
his
bed
he
looks
the
stage
rang
with
gay
song
red
or
white
liquor
coarse
or
fine
what
can
it
matter
so
we
have
wine
students
citizens
soldiers
girls
and
matrons
whirled
before
the
inn
with
the
figure
of
bacchus
for
a
sign
siebel
made
her
entrance
christine
daae
looked
charming
in
her
boy
clothes
and
carlotta
partisans
expected
to
hear
her
greeted
with
an
ovation
which
would
have
enlightened
them
as
to
the
intentions
of
her
friends
but
nothing
happened
on
the
other
hand
when
margarita
crossed
the
stage
and
sang
the
only
two
lines
allotted
her
in
this
second
act
no
my
lord
not
a
lady
am
i
nor
yet
a
beauty
and
do
not
need
an
arm
to
help
me
on
my
way
carlotta
was
received
with
enthusiastic
applause
it
was
so
unexpected
and
so
uncalled
for
that
those
who
knew
nothing
about
the
rumors
looked
at
one
another
and
asked
what
was
happening
and
this
act
also
was
finished
without
incident
then
everybody
said
of
course
it
will
be
during
the
next
act
some
who
seemed
to
be
better
informed
than
the
rest
declared
that
the
row
would
begin
with
the
ballad
of
the
king
of
thule
and
rushed
to
the
subscribers
entrance
to
warn
carlotta
the
managers
left
the
box
during
the
to
find
out
more
about
the
cabal
of
which
the
had
spoken
but
they
soon
returned
to
their
seats
shrugging
their
shoulders
and
treating
the
whole
affair
as
silly
the
first
thing
they
saw
on
entering
the
box
was
a
box
of
english
sweets
on
the
little
shelf
of
the
ledge
who
had
put
it
there
they
asked
the
but
none
of
them
knew
then
they
went
back
to
the
shelf
and
next
to
the
box
of
sweets
found
an
opera
glass
they
looked
at
each
other
they
had
no
inclination
to
laugh
all
that
mme
giry
had
told
them
returned
to
their
memory
and
then
and
then
they
seemed
to
feel
a
curious
sort
of
draft
around
them
they
sat
down
in
silence
the
scene
represented
margarita
garden
gentle
in
the
dew
be
message
from
me
as
she
sang
these
first
two
lines
with
her
bunch
of
roses
and
lilacs
in
her
hand
christine
raising
her
head
saw
the
vicomte
de
chagny
in
his
box
and
from
that
moment
her
voice
seemed
less
sure
less
than
usual
something
seemed
to
deaden
and
dull
her
singing
what
a
queer
girl
she
is
said
one
of
carlotta
friends
in
the
stalls
almost
aloud
the
other
day
she
was
divine
and
she
simply
bleating
she
has
no
experience
no
training
gentle
lie
ye
there
and
tell
her
from
me
the
viscount
put
his
head
under
his
hands
and
wept
the
count
behind
him
viciously
gnawed
his
mustache
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
frowned
for
him
usually
so
cold
and
correct
to
betray
his
inner
feelings
like
that
by
outward
signs
the
count
must
be
very
angry
he
was
he
had
seen
his
brother
return
from
a
rapid
and
mysterious
journey
in
an
alarming
state
of
health
the
explanation
that
followed
was
unsatisfactory
and
the
count
asked
christine
daae
for
an
appointment
she
had
the
audacity
to
reply
that
she
could
not
see
either
him
or
his
brother
would
she
but
deign
to
hear
me
and
with
one
smile
to
cheer
me
the
little
baggage
growled
the
count
and
he
wondered
what
she
wanted
what
she
was
hoping
for
she
was
a
virtuous
girl
she
was
said
to
have
no
friend
no
protector
of
any
sort
that
angel
from
the
north
must
be
very
artful
raoul
behind
the
curtain
of
his
hands
that
veiled
his
boyish
tears
thought
only
of
the
letter
which
he
received
on
his
return
to
paris
where
christine
fleeing
from
perros
like
a
thief
in
the
night
had
arrived
before
him
my
dear
little
playfellow
you
must
have
the
courage
not
to
see
me
again
not
to
speak
of
me
again
if
you
love
me
just
a
little
do
this
for
me
for
me
who
will
never
forget
you
my
dear
raoul
my
life
depends
upon
it
your
life
depends
upon
it
your
little
christine
thunders
of
applause
carlotta
made
her
entrance
i
wish
i
could
but
know
who
was
he
that
addressed
me
if
he
was
noble
or
at
least
what
his
name
is
when
margarita
had
finished
singing
the
ballad
of
the
king
of
thule
she
was
loudly
cheered
and
again
when
she
came
to
the
end
of
the
jewel
song
ah
the
joy
of
past
compare
these
jewels
bright
to
wear
thenceforth
certain
of
herself
certain
of
her
friends
in
the
house
certain
of
her
voice
and
her
success
fearing
nothing
carlotta
flung
herself
into
her
part
without
restraint
of
modesty
she
was
no
longer
margarita
she
was
carmen
she
was
applauded
all
the
more
and
her
debut
with
faust
seemed
about
to
bring
her
a
new
success
when
suddenly
a
terrible
thing
happened
faust
had
knelt
on
one
knee
let
me
gaze
on
the
form
below
me
while
from
yonder
ether
blue
look
how
the
star
of
eve
bright
and
tender
lingers
me
to
love
thy
beauty
too
and
margarita
replied
oh
how
strange
like
a
spell
does
the
evening
bind
me
and
a
deep
languid
charm
i
feel
without
alarm
with
its
melody
enwind
me
and
all
my
heart
subdue
at
that
moment
at
that
identical
moment
the
terrible
thing
happened
carlotta
croaked
like
a
toad
there
was
consternation
on
carlotta
face
and
consternation
on
the
faces
of
all
the
audience
the
two
managers
in
their
box
could
not
suppress
an
exclamation
of
horror
every
one
felt
that
the
thing
was
not
natural
that
there
was
witchcraft
behind
it
that
toad
smelt
of
brimstone
poor
wretched
despairing
crushed
carlotta
the
uproar
in
the
house
was
indescribable
if
the
thing
had
happened
to
any
one
but
carlotta
she
would
have
been
hooted
but
everybody
knew
how
perfect
an
instrument
her
voice
was
and
there
was
no
display
of
anger
but
only
of
horror
and
dismay
the
sort
of
dismay
which
men
would
have
felt
if
they
had
witnessed
the
catastrophe
that
broke
the
arms
of
the
venus
de
milo
and
even
then
they
would
have
seen
and
understood
but
here
that
toad
was
incomprehensible
so
much
so
that
after
some
seconds
spent
in
asking
herself
if
she
had
really
heard
that
note
that
sound
that
infernal
noise
issue
from
her
throat
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
it
was
not
so
that
she
was
the
victim
of
an
illusion
an
illusion
of
the
ear
and
not
of
an
act
of
treachery
on
the
part
of
her
voice
meanwhile
in
box
five
moncharmin
and
richard
had
turned
very
pale
this
extraordinary
and
inexplicable
incident
filled
them
with
a
dread
which
was
the
more
mysterious
inasmuch
as
for
some
little
while
they
had
fallen
within
the
direct
influence
of
the
ghost
they
had
felt
his
breath
moncharmin
hair
stood
on
end
richard
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
yes
the
ghost
was
there
around
them
behind
them
beside
them
they
felt
his
presence
without
seeing
him
they
heard
his
breath
close
close
close
to
them
they
were
sure
that
there
were
three
people
in
the
box
they
trembled
they
thought
of
running
away
they
dared
not
they
dared
not
make
a
movement
or
exchange
a
word
that
would
have
told
the
ghost
that
they
knew
that
he
was
there
what
was
going
to
happen
this
happened
their
joint
exclamation
of
horror
was
heard
all
over
the
house
they
felt
that
they
were
smarting
under
the
ghost
attacks
leaning
over
the
ledge
of
their
box
they
stared
at
carlotta
as
though
they
did
not
recognize
her
that
infernal
girl
must
have
given
the
signal
for
some
catastrophe
ah
they
were
waiting
for
the
catastrophe
the
ghost
had
told
them
it
would
come
the
house
had
a
curse
upon
it
the
two
managers
gasped
and
panted
under
the
weight
of
the
catastrophe
richard
stifled
voice
was
heard
calling
to
carlotta
well
go
on
no
carlotta
did
not
go
on
bravely
heroically
she
started
afresh
on
the
fatal
line
at
the
end
of
which
the
toad
had
appeared
an
awful
silence
succeeded
the
uproar
carlotta
voice
alone
once
more
filled
the
resounding
house
i
feel
without
alarm
the
audience
also
felt
but
not
without
alarm
i
feel
without
alarm
i
feel
without
alarm
with
its
melody
enwind
me
and
all
my
heart
sub
the
toad
also
had
started
afresh
the
house
broke
into
a
wild
tumult
the
two
managers
collapsed
in
their
chairs
and
dared
not
even
turn
round
they
had
not
the
strength
the
ghost
was
chuckling
behind
their
backs
and
at
last
they
distinctly
heard
his
voice
in
their
right
ears
the
impossible
voice
the
mouthless
voice
saying
she
is
singing
to
bring
the
chandelier
down
with
one
accord
they
raised
their
eyes
to
the
ceiling
and
uttered
a
terrible
cry
the
chandelier
the
immense
mass
of
the
chandelier
was
slipping
down
coming
toward
them
at
the
call
of
that
fiendish
voice
released
from
its
hook
it
plunged
from
the
ceiling
and
came
smashing
into
the
middle
of
the
stalls
amid
a
thousand
shouts
of
terror
a
wild
rush
for
the
doors
followed
the
papers
of
the
day
state
that
there
were
numbers
wounded
and
one
killed
the
chandelier
had
crashed
down
upon
the
head
of
the
wretched
woman
who
had
come
to
the
opera
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
the
one
whom
richard
had
appointed
to
succeed
mme
giry
the
in
her
functions
she
died
on
the
spot
and
the
next
morning
a
newspaper
appeared
with
this
heading
two
hundred
kilos
on
the
head
of
a
concierge
that
was
her
sole
epitaph
chapter
viii
the
mysterious
brougham
that
tragic
evening
was
bad
for
everybody
carlotta
fell
as
for
christine
daae
she
disappeared
after
the
performance
a
fortnight
elapsed
during
which
she
was
seen
neither
at
the
opera
nor
outside
raoul
of
course
was
the
first
to
be
astonished
at
the
prima
absence
he
wrote
to
her
at
mme
valerius
flat
and
received
no
reply
his
grief
increased
and
he
ended
by
being
seriously
alarmed
at
never
seeing
her
name
on
the
program
faust
was
played
without
her
one
afternoon
he
went
to
the
managers
office
to
ask
the
reason
of
christine
disappearance
he
found
them
both
looking
extremely
worried
their
own
friends
did
not
recognize
them
they
had
lost
all
their
gaiety
and
spirits
they
were
seen
crossing
the
stage
with
hanging
heads
brows
pale
cheeks
as
though
pursued
by
some
abominable
thought
or
a
prey
to
some
persistent
sport
of
fate
the
fall
of
the
chandelier
had
involved
them
in
no
little
responsibility
but
it
was
difficult
to
make
them
speak
about
it
the
inquest
had
ended
in
a
verdict
of
accidental
death
caused
by
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
chains
by
which
the
chandelier
was
hung
from
the
ceiling
but
it
was
the
duty
of
both
the
old
and
the
new
managers
to
have
discovered
this
wear
and
tear
and
to
have
remedied
it
in
time
and
i
feel
bound
to
say
that
mm
richard
and
moncharmin
at
this
time
appeared
so
changed
so
so
mysterious
so
incomprehensible
that
many
of
the
subscribers
thought
that
some
event
even
more
horrible
than
the
fall
of
the
chandelier
must
have
affected
their
state
of
mind
in
their
daily
intercourse
they
showed
themselves
very
impatient
except
with
mme
giry
who
had
been
reinstated
in
her
functions
and
their
reception
of
the
vicomte
de
chagny
when
he
came
to
ask
about
christine
was
anything
but
cordial
they
merely
told
him
that
she
was
taking
a
holiday
he
asked
how
long
the
holiday
was
for
and
they
replied
curtly
that
it
was
for
an
unlimited
period
as
mlle
daae
had
requested
leave
of
absence
for
reasons
of
health
then
she
is
ill
he
cried
what
is
the
matter
with
her
we
do
know
did
you
send
the
doctor
of
the
opera
to
see
her
no
she
did
not
ask
for
him
and
as
we
trust
her
we
took
her
word
raoul
left
the
building
a
prey
to
the
gloomiest
thoughts
he
resolved
come
what
might
to
go
and
inquire
of
mamma
valerius
he
remembered
the
strong
phrases
in
christine
letter
forbidding
him
to
make
any
attempt
to
see
her
but
what
he
had
seen
at
perros
what
he
had
heard
behind
the
door
his
conversation
with
christine
at
the
edge
of
the
moor
made
him
suspect
some
machination
which
devilish
though
it
might
be
was
none
the
less
human
the
girl
highly
strung
imagination
her
affectionate
and
credulous
mind
the
primitive
education
which
had
surrounded
her
childhood
with
a
circle
of
legends
the
constant
brooding
over
her
dead
father
and
above
all
the
state
of
sublime
ecstasy
into
which
music
threw
her
from
the
moment
that
this
art
was
made
manifest
to
her
in
certain
exceptional
conditions
as
in
the
churchyard
at
perros
all
this
seemed
to
him
to
constitute
a
moral
ground
only
too
favorable
for
the
malevolent
designs
of
some
mysterious
and
unscrupulous
person
of
whom
was
christine
daae
the
victim
this
was
the
very
reasonable
question
which
raoul
put
to
himself
as
he
hurried
off
to
mamma
valerius
he
trembled
as
he
rang
at
a
little
flat
in
the
rue
the
door
was
opened
by
the
maid
whom
he
had
seen
coming
out
of
christine
one
evening
he
asked
if
he
could
speak
to
mme
valerius
he
was
told
that
she
was
ill
in
bed
and
was
not
receiving
visitors
take
in
my
card
please
he
said
the
maid
soon
returned
and
showed
him
into
a
small
and
scantily
furnished
in
which
portraits
of
professor
valerius
and
old
daae
hung
on
opposite
walls
madame
begs
monsieur
le
vicomte
to
excuse
her
said
the
servant
she
can
only
see
him
in
her
bedroom
because
she
can
no
longer
stand
on
her
poor
legs
five
minutes
later
raoul
was
ushered
into
an
room
where
he
at
once
recognized
the
good
kind
face
of
christine
benefactress
in
the
of
an
alcove
mamma
valerius
hair
was
now
quite
white
but
her
eyes
had
grown
no
older
never
on
the
contrary
had
their
expression
been
so
bright
so
pure
so
de
chagny
she
cried
gaily
putting
out
both
her
hands
to
her
visitor
ah
it
heaven
that
sends
you
here
we
can
talk
of
her
this
last
sentence
sounded
very
gloomily
in
the
young
man
ears
he
at
once
asked
madame
where
is
christine
and
the
old
lady
replied
calmly
she
is
with
her
good
genius
what
good
genius
exclaimed
poor
raoul
why
the
angel
of
music
the
viscount
dropped
into
a
chair
really
christine
was
with
the
angel
of
music
and
there
lay
mamma
valerius
in
bed
smiling
to
him
and
putting
her
finger
to
her
lips
to
warn
him
to
be
silent
and
she
added
you
must
not
tell
anybody
you
can
rely
on
me
said
raoul
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
for
his
ideas
about
christine
already
greatly
confused
were
becoming
more
and
more
entangled
and
it
seemed
as
if
everything
was
beginning
to
turn
around
him
around
the
room
around
that
extraordinary
good
lady
with
the
white
hair
and
eyes
i
know
i
know
i
can
she
said
with
a
happy
laugh
but
why
you
come
near
me
as
you
used
to
do
when
you
were
a
little
boy
give
me
your
hands
as
when
you
brought
me
the
story
of
little
lotte
which
daddy
daae
had
told
you
i
am
very
fond
of
you
raoul
you
know
and
so
is
christine
too
she
is
fond
of
me
sighed
the
young
man
he
found
a
difficulty
in
collecting
his
thoughts
and
bringing
them
to
bear
on
mamma
good
genius
on
the
angel
of
music
of
whom
christine
had
spoken
to
him
so
strangely
on
the
death
head
which
he
had
seen
in
a
sort
of
nightmare
on
the
high
altar
at
perros
and
also
on
the
opera
ghost
whose
fame
had
come
to
his
ears
one
evening
when
he
was
standing
behind
the
scenes
within
hearing
of
a
group
of
who
were
repeating
the
ghastly
description
which
the
hanged
man
joseph
buquet
had
given
of
the
ghost
before
his
mysterious
death
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
what
makes
you
think
that
christine
is
fond
of
me
madame
she
used
to
speak
of
you
every
day
really
and
what
did
she
tell
you
she
told
me
that
you
had
made
her
a
proposal
and
the
good
old
lady
began
laughing
wholeheartedly
raoul
sprang
from
his
chair
flushing
to
the
temples
suffering
agonies
what
this
where
are
you
going
sit
down
again
at
once
will
you
do
you
think
i
will
let
you
go
like
that
if
you
angry
with
me
for
laughing
i
beg
your
pardon
after
all
what
has
happened
is
your
fault
did
you
know
did
you
think
that
christine
was
free
is
christine
engaged
to
be
married
the
wretched
raoul
asked
in
a
choking
voice
why
no
why
no
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
christine
marry
even
if
she
wanted
to
but
i
do
know
anything
about
it
and
why
ca
christine
marry
because
of
the
angel
of
music
of
course
i
do
follow
yes
he
forbids
her
to
he
forbids
her
the
angel
of
music
forbids
her
to
marry
oh
he
forbids
her
without
forbidding
her
it
like
this
he
tells
her
that
if
she
got
married
she
would
never
hear
him
again
that
all
and
that
he
would
go
away
for
ever
so
you
understand
she
ca
let
the
angel
of
music
go
it
quite
natural
yes
yes
echoed
raoul
submissively
it
quite
natural
besides
i
thought
christine
had
told
you
all
that
when
she
met
you
at
perros
where
she
went
with
her
good
genius
oh
she
went
to
perros
with
her
good
genius
did
she
that
is
to
say
he
arranged
to
meet
her
down
there
in
perros
churchyard
at
daae
grave
he
promised
to
play
her
the
resurrection
of
lazarus
on
her
father
violin
raoul
de
chagny
rose
and
with
a
very
authoritative
air
pronounced
these
peremptory
words
madame
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
where
that
genius
lives
the
old
lady
did
not
seem
surprised
at
this
indiscreet
command
she
raised
her
eyes
and
said
in
heaven
such
simplicity
baffled
him
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
in
the
presence
of
this
candid
and
perfect
faith
in
a
genius
who
came
down
nightly
from
heaven
to
haunt
the
at
the
opera
he
now
realized
the
possible
state
of
mind
of
a
girl
brought
up
between
a
superstitious
fiddler
and
a
visionary
old
lady
and
he
shuddered
when
he
thought
of
the
consequences
of
it
all
is
christine
still
a
good
girl
he
asked
suddenly
in
spite
of
himself
i
swear
it
as
i
hope
to
be
saved
exclaimed
the
old
woman
who
this
time
seemed
to
be
incensed
and
if
you
doubt
it
sir
i
do
know
what
you
are
here
for
raoul
tore
at
his
gloves
how
long
has
she
known
this
about
three
months
yes
it
quite
three
months
since
he
began
to
give
her
lessons
the
viscount
threw
up
his
arms
with
a
gesture
of
despair
the
genius
gives
her
lessons
and
where
pray
now
that
she
has
gone
away
with
him
i
ca
say
but
up
to
a
fortnight
ago
it
was
in
christine
it
would
be
impossible
in
this
little
flat
the
whole
house
would
hear
them
whereas
at
the
opera
at
eight
in
the
morning
there
is
no
one
about
do
you
see
yes
i
see
i
see
cried
the
viscount
and
he
hurriedly
took
leave
of
mme
valerius
who
asked
herself
if
the
young
nobleman
was
not
a
little
off
his
head
he
walked
home
to
his
brother
house
in
a
pitiful
state
he
could
have
struck
himself
banged
his
head
against
the
walls
to
think
that
he
had
believed
in
her
innocence
in
her
purity
the
angel
of
music
he
knew
him
now
he
saw
him
it
was
beyond
a
doubt
some
unspeakable
tenor
a
jackanapes
who
mouthed
and
simpered
as
he
sang
he
thought
himself
as
absurd
and
as
wretched
as
could
be
oh
what
a
miserable
little
insignificant
silly
young
man
was
le
vicomte
de
chagny
thought
raoul
furiously
and
she
what
a
bold
and
damnable
sly
creature
his
brother
was
waiting
for
him
and
raoul
fell
into
his
arms
like
a
child
the
count
consoled
him
without
asking
for
explanations
and
raoul
would
certainly
have
long
hesitated
before
telling
him
the
story
of
the
angel
of
music
his
brother
suggested
taking
him
out
to
dinner
overcome
as
he
was
with
despair
raoul
would
probably
have
refused
any
invitation
that
evening
if
the
count
had
not
as
an
inducement
told
him
that
the
lady
of
his
thoughts
had
been
seen
the
night
before
in
company
of
the
other
sex
in
the
bois
at
first
the
viscount
refused
to
believe
but
he
received
such
exact
details
that
he
ceased
protesting
she
had
been
seen
it
appeared
driving
in
a
brougham
with
the
window
down
she
seemed
to
be
slowly
taking
in
the
icy
night
air
there
was
a
glorious
moon
shining
she
was
recognized
beyond
a
doubt
as
for
her
companion
only
his
shadowy
outline
was
distinguished
leaning
back
in
the
dark
the
carriage
was
going
at
a
walking
pace
in
a
lonely
drive
behind
the
grand
stand
at
longchamp
raoul
dressed
in
frantic
haste
prepared
to
forget
his
distress
by
flinging
himself
as
people
say
into
the
vortex
of
pleasure
alas
he
was
a
very
sorry
guest
and
leaving
his
brother
early
found
himself
by
ten
in
the
evening
in
a
cab
behind
the
longchamp
it
was
bitterly
cold
the
road
seemed
deserted
and
very
bright
under
the
moonlight
he
told
the
driver
to
wait
for
him
patiently
at
the
corner
of
a
near
turning
and
hiding
himself
as
well
as
he
could
stood
stamping
his
feet
to
keep
warm
he
had
been
indulging
in
this
healthy
exercise
for
half
an
hour
or
so
when
a
carriage
turned
the
corner
of
the
road
and
came
quietly
in
his
direction
at
a
walking
pace
as
it
approached
he
saw
that
a
woman
was
leaning
her
head
from
the
window
and
suddenly
the
moon
shed
a
pale
gleam
over
her
features
christine
the
sacred
name
of
his
love
had
sprung
from
his
heart
and
his
lips
he
could
not
keep
it
back
he
would
have
given
anything
to
withdraw
it
for
that
name
proclaimed
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
had
acted
as
though
it
were
the
preconcerted
signal
for
a
furious
rush
on
the
part
of
the
whole
which
dashed
past
him
before
he
could
put
into
execution
his
plan
of
leaping
at
the
horses
heads
the
carriage
window
had
been
closed
and
the
girl
face
had
disappeared
and
the
brougham
behind
which
he
was
now
running
was
no
more
than
a
black
spot
on
the
white
road
he
called
out
again
christine
no
reply
and
he
stopped
in
the
midst
of
the
silence
with
a
eye
he
stared
down
that
cold
desolate
road
and
into
the
pale
dead
night
nothing
was
colder
than
his
heart
nothing
half
so
dead
he
had
loved
an
angel
and
now
he
despised
a
woman
raoul
how
that
little
fairy
of
the
north
has
trifled
with
you
was
it
really
was
it
really
necessary
to
have
so
fresh
and
young
a
face
a
forehead
so
shy
and
always
ready
to
cover
itself
with
the
pink
blush
of
modesty
in
order
to
pass
in
the
lonely
night
in
a
carriage
and
pair
accompanied
by
a
mysterious
lover
surely
there
should
be
some
limit
to
hypocrisy
and
lying
she
had
passed
without
answering
his
cry
and
he
was
thinking
of
dying
and
he
was
twenty
years
old
his
valet
found
him
in
the
morning
sitting
on
his
bed
he
had
not
undressed
and
the
servant
feared
at
the
sight
of
his
face
that
some
disaster
had
occurred
raoul
snatched
his
letters
from
the
hands
he
had
recognized
christine
paper
and
she
said
dear
go
to
the
masked
ball
at
the
opera
on
the
night
after
at
twelve
be
in
the
little
room
behind
the
of
the
big
stand
near
the
door
that
leads
to
the
rotunda
mention
this
appointment
to
any
one
on
earth
wear
a
white
domino
and
be
carefully
masked
as
you
love
me
do
not
let
yourself
be
recognized
christine
chapter
ix
at
the
masked
ball
the
envelope
was
covered
with
mud
and
unstamped
it
bore
the
words
to
be
handed
to
le
vicomte
raoul
de
chagny
with
the
address
in
pencil
it
must
have
been
flung
out
in
the
hope
that
a
would
pick
up
the
note
and
deliver
it
which
was
what
happened
the
note
had
been
picked
up
on
the
pavement
of
the
place
de
raoul
read
it
over
again
with
fevered
eyes
no
more
was
needed
to
revive
his
hope
the
somber
picture
which
he
had
for
a
moment
imagined
of
a
christine
forgetting
her
duty
to
herself
made
way
for
his
original
conception
of
an
unfortunate
innocent
child
the
victim
of
imprudence
and
exaggerated
sensibility
to
what
extent
at
this
time
was
she
really
a
victim
whose
prisoner
was
she
into
what
whirlpool
had
she
been
dragged
he
asked
himself
these
questions
with
a
cruel
anguish
but
even
this
pain
seemed
endurable
beside
the
frenzy
into
which
he
was
thrown
at
the
thought
of
a
lying
and
deceitful
christine
what
had
happened
what
influence
had
she
undergone
what
monster
had
carried
her
off
and
by
what
means
by
what
means
indeed
but
that
of
music
he
knew
christine
story
after
her
father
death
she
acquired
a
distaste
of
everything
in
life
including
her
art
she
went
through
the
conservatoire
like
a
poor
soulless
and
suddenly
she
awoke
as
though
through
the
intervention
of
a
god
the
angel
of
music
appeared
upon
the
scene
she
sang
margarita
in
faust
and
triumphed
the
angel
of
music
for
three
months
the
angel
of
music
had
been
giving
christine
lessons
ah
he
was
a
punctual
and
now
he
was
taking
her
for
drives
in
the
bois
raoul
fingers
clutched
at
his
flesh
above
his
jealous
heart
in
his
inexperience
he
now
asked
himself
with
terror
what
game
the
girl
was
playing
up
to
what
point
could
an
make
a
fool
of
a
young
man
quite
new
to
love
o
misery
thus
did
raoul
thoughts
fly
from
one
extreme
to
the
other
he
no
longer
knew
whether
to
pity
christine
or
to
curse
her
and
he
pitied
and
cursed
her
turn
and
turn
about
at
all
events
he
bought
a
white
domino
the
hour
of
the
appointment
came
at
last
with
his
face
in
a
mask
trimmed
with
long
thick
lace
looking
like
a
pierrot
in
his
white
wrap
the
viscount
thought
himself
very
ridiculous
men
of
the
world
do
not
go
to
the
opera
ball
in
it
was
absurd
one
thought
however
consoled
the
viscount
he
would
certainly
never
be
recognized
this
ball
was
an
exceptional
affair
given
some
time
before
shrovetide
in
honor
of
the
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
a
famous
draftsman
and
it
was
expected
to
be
much
gayer
noisier
more
bohemian
than
the
ordinary
masked
ball
numbers
of
artists
had
arranged
to
go
accompanied
by
a
whole
cohort
of
models
and
pupils
who
by
midnight
began
to
create
a
tremendous
din
raoul
climbed
the
grand
staircase
at
five
minutes
to
twelve
did
not
linger
to
look
at
the
motley
dresses
displayed
all
the
way
up
the
marble
steps
one
of
the
richest
settings
in
the
world
allowed
no
facetious
mask
to
draw
him
into
a
war
of
wits
replied
to
no
jests
and
shook
off
the
bold
familiarity
of
a
number
of
couples
who
had
already
become
a
trifle
too
gay
crossing
the
big
and
escaping
from
a
mad
whirl
of
dancers
in
which
he
was
caught
for
a
moment
he
at
last
entered
the
room
mentioned
in
christine
letter
he
found
it
crammed
for
this
small
space
was
the
point
where
all
those
who
were
going
to
supper
in
the
rotunda
crossed
those
who
were
returning
from
taking
a
glass
of
champagne
the
fun
here
waxed
fast
and
furious
raoul
leaned
against
a
and
waited
he
did
not
wait
long
a
black
domino
passed
and
gave
a
quick
squeeze
to
the
tips
of
his
fingers
he
understood
that
it
was
she
and
followed
her
is
that
you
christine
he
asked
between
his
teeth
the
black
domino
turned
round
promptly
and
raised
her
finger
to
her
lips
no
doubt
to
warn
him
not
to
mention
her
name
again
raoul
continued
to
follow
her
in
silence
he
was
afraid
of
losing
her
after
meeting
her
again
in
such
strange
circumstances
his
grudge
against
her
was
gone
he
no
longer
doubted
that
she
had
nothing
to
reproach
herself
with
however
peculiar
and
inexplicable
her
conduct
might
seem
he
was
ready
to
make
any
display
of
clemency
forgiveness
or
cowardice
he
was
in
love
and
no
doubt
he
would
soon
receive
a
very
natural
explanation
of
her
curious
absence
the
black
domino
turned
back
from
time
to
time
to
see
if
the
white
domino
was
still
following
as
raoul
once
more
passed
through
the
great
this
time
in
the
wake
of
his
guide
he
could
not
help
noticing
a
group
crowding
round
a
person
whose
disguise
eccentric
air
and
gruesome
appearance
were
causing
a
sensation
it
was
a
man
dressed
all
in
scarlet
with
a
huge
hat
and
feathers
on
the
top
of
a
wonderful
death
head
from
his
shoulders
hung
an
immense
cloak
which
trailed
along
the
floor
like
a
king
train
and
on
this
cloak
was
embroidered
in
gold
letters
which
every
one
read
and
repeated
aloud
do
touch
me
i
am
red
death
stalking
abroad
then
one
greatly
daring
did
try
to
touch
him
but
a
skeleton
hand
shot
out
of
a
crimson
sleeve
and
violently
seized
the
rash
one
wrist
and
he
feeling
the
clutch
of
the
knucklebones
the
furious
grasp
of
death
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
and
terror
when
red
death
released
him
at
last
he
ran
away
like
a
very
madman
pursued
by
the
jeers
of
the
bystanders
it
was
at
this
moment
that
raoul
passed
in
front
of
the
funereal
masquerader
who
had
just
happened
to
turn
in
his
direction
and
he
nearly
exclaimed
the
death
head
of
he
had
recognized
him
he
wanted
to
dart
forward
forgetting
christine
but
the
black
domino
who
also
seemed
a
prey
to
some
strange
excitement
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
from
the
far
from
the
mad
crowd
through
which
red
death
was
stalking
the
black
domino
kept
on
turning
back
and
apparently
on
two
occasions
saw
something
that
startled
her
for
she
hurried
her
pace
and
as
though
they
were
being
pursued
they
went
up
two
floors
here
the
stairs
and
corridors
were
almost
deserted
the
black
domino
opened
the
door
of
a
private
box
and
beckoned
to
the
white
domino
to
follow
her
then
christine
whom
he
recognized
by
the
sound
of
her
voice
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
warned
him
in
a
whisper
to
remain
at
the
back
of
the
box
and
on
no
account
to
show
himself
raoul
took
off
his
mask
christine
kept
hers
on
and
when
raoul
was
about
to
ask
her
to
remove
it
he
was
surprised
to
see
her
put
her
ear
to
the
partition
and
listen
eagerly
for
a
sound
outside
then
she
opened
the
door
ajar
looked
out
into
the
corridor
and
in
a
low
voice
said
he
must
have
gone
up
higher
suddenly
she
exclaimed
he
is
coming
down
again
she
tried
to
close
the
door
but
raoul
prevented
her
for
he
had
seen
on
the
top
step
of
the
staircase
that
led
to
the
floor
above
a
red
foot
followed
by
another
and
slowly
majestically
the
whole
scarlet
dress
of
red
death
met
his
eyes
and
he
once
more
saw
the
death
head
of
it
he
he
exclaimed
this
time
he
shall
not
escape
me
but
christian
sic
had
slammed
the
door
at
the
moment
when
raoul
was
on
the
point
of
rushing
out
he
tried
to
push
her
aside
whom
do
you
mean
by
she
asked
in
a
changed
voice
who
shall
not
escape
you
raoul
tried
to
overcome
the
girl
resistance
by
force
but
she
repelled
him
with
a
strength
which
he
would
not
have
suspected
in
her
he
understood
or
thought
he
understood
and
at
once
lost
his
temper
who
he
repeated
angrily
why
he
the
man
who
hides
behind
that
hideous
mask
of
death
the
evil
genius
of
the
churchyard
at
perros
red
death
in
a
word
madam
your
friend
your
angel
of
music
but
i
shall
snatch
off
his
mask
as
i
shall
snatch
off
my
own
and
this
time
we
shall
look
each
other
in
the
face
he
and
i
with
no
veil
and
no
lies
between
us
and
i
shall
know
whom
you
love
and
who
loves
you
he
burst
into
a
mad
laugh
while
christine
gave
a
disconsolate
moan
behind
her
velvet
mask
with
a
tragic
gesture
she
flung
out
her
two
arms
which
fixed
a
barrier
of
white
flesh
against
the
door
in
the
name
of
our
love
raoul
you
shall
not
pass
he
stopped
what
had
she
said
in
the
name
of
their
love
never
before
had
she
confessed
that
she
loved
him
and
yet
she
had
had
opportunities
enough
pooh
her
only
object
was
to
gain
a
few
seconds
she
wished
to
give
the
red
death
time
to
escape
and
in
accents
of
childish
hatred
he
said
you
lie
madam
for
you
do
not
love
me
and
you
have
never
loved
me
what
a
poor
fellow
i
must
be
to
let
you
mock
and
flout
me
as
you
have
done
why
did
you
give
me
every
reason
for
hope
at
perros
for
honest
hope
madam
for
i
am
an
honest
man
and
i
believed
you
to
be
an
honest
woman
when
your
only
intention
was
to
deceive
me
alas
you
have
deceived
us
all
you
have
taken
a
shameful
advantage
of
the
candid
affection
of
your
benefactress
herself
who
continues
to
believe
in
your
sincerity
while
you
go
about
the
opera
ball
with
red
death
i
despise
you
and
he
burst
into
tears
she
allowed
him
to
insult
her
she
thought
of
but
one
thing
to
keep
him
from
leaving
the
box
you
will
beg
my
pardon
one
day
for
all
those
ugly
words
raoul
and
when
you
do
i
shall
forgive
you
he
shook
his
head
no
no
you
have
driven
me
mad
when
i
think
that
i
had
only
one
object
in
life
to
give
my
name
to
an
opera
wench
raoul
how
can
you
i
shall
die
of
shame
no
dear
live
said
christine
grave
and
changed
voice
and
raoul
the
boy
stepped
forward
staggering
as
he
went
he
risked
one
more
sarcasm
oh
you
must
let
me
come
and
applaud
you
from
time
to
time
i
shall
never
sing
again
raoul
really
he
replied
still
more
satirically
so
he
is
taking
you
off
the
stage
i
congratulate
you
but
we
shall
meet
in
the
bois
one
of
these
evenings
not
in
the
bois
nor
anywhere
raoul
you
shall
not
see
me
again
may
one
ask
at
least
to
what
darkness
you
are
returning
for
what
hell
are
you
leaving
mysterious
lady
or
for
what
paradise
i
came
to
tell
you
dear
but
i
ca
tell
you
now
you
would
not
believe
me
you
have
lost
faith
in
me
raoul
it
is
finished
she
spoke
in
such
a
despairing
voice
that
the
lad
began
to
feel
remorse
for
his
cruelty
but
look
here
he
cried
ca
you
tell
me
what
all
this
means
you
are
free
there
is
no
one
to
interfere
with
you
you
go
about
paris
you
put
on
a
domino
to
come
to
the
ball
why
do
you
not
go
home
what
have
you
been
doing
this
past
fortnight
what
is
this
tale
about
the
angel
of
music
which
you
have
been
telling
mamma
valerius
some
one
may
have
taken
you
in
played
upon
your
innocence
i
was
a
witness
of
it
myself
at
perros
but
you
know
what
to
believe
now
you
seem
to
me
quite
sensible
christine
you
know
what
you
are
doing
and
meanwhile
mamma
valerius
lies
waiting
for
you
at
home
and
appealing
to
your
genius
explain
yourself
christine
i
beg
of
you
any
one
might
have
been
deceived
as
i
was
what
is
this
farce
christine
simply
took
off
her
mask
and
said
dear
it
is
a
tragedy
raoul
now
saw
her
face
and
could
not
restrain
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
terror
the
fresh
complexion
of
former
days
was
gone
a
mortal
pallor
covered
those
features
which
he
had
known
so
charming
and
so
gentle
and
sorrow
had
furrowed
them
with
pitiless
lines
and
traced
dark
and
unspeakably
sad
shadows
under
her
eyes
my
dearest
my
dearest
he
moaned
holding
out
his
arms
you
promised
to
forgive
me
perhaps
some
day
perhaps
she
said
resuming
her
mask
and
she
went
away
forbidding
him
with
a
gesture
to
follow
her
he
tried
to
disobey
her
but
she
turned
round
and
repeated
her
gesture
of
farewell
with
such
authority
that
he
dared
not
move
a
step
he
watched
her
till
she
was
out
of
sight
then
he
also
went
down
among
the
crowd
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
doing
with
throbbing
temples
and
an
aching
heart
and
as
he
crossed
the
he
asked
if
anybody
had
seen
red
death
yes
every
one
had
seen
red
death
but
raoul
could
not
find
him
and
at
two
in
the
morning
he
turned
down
the
passage
behind
the
scenes
that
led
to
christine
his
footsteps
took
him
to
that
room
where
he
had
first
known
suffering
he
tapped
at
the
door
there
was
no
answer
he
entered
as
he
had
entered
when
he
looked
everywhere
for
the
man
voice
the
room
was
empty
a
was
burning
turned
down
low
he
saw
some
on
a
little
desk
he
thought
of
writing
to
christine
but
he
heard
steps
in
the
passage
he
had
only
time
to
hide
in
the
inner
room
which
was
separated
from
the
by
a
curtain
christine
entered
took
off
her
mask
with
a
weary
movement
and
flung
it
on
the
table
she
sighed
and
let
her
pretty
head
fall
into
her
two
hands
what
was
she
thinking
of
of
raoul
no
for
raoul
heard
her
murmur
poor
erik
at
first
he
thought
he
must
be
mistaken
to
begin
with
he
was
persuaded
that
if
any
one
was
to
be
pitied
it
was
he
raoul
it
would
have
been
quite
natural
if
she
had
said
poor
raoul
after
what
had
happened
between
them
but
shaking
her
head
she
repeated
poor
erik
what
had
this
erik
to
do
with
christine
sighs
and
why
was
she
pitying
erik
when
raoul
was
so
unhappy
christine
began
to
write
deliberately
calmly
and
so
placidly
that
raoul
who
was
still
trembling
from
the
effects
of
the
tragedy
that
separated
them
was
painfully
impressed
what
coolness
he
said
to
himself
she
wrote
on
filling
two
three
four
sheets
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
and
hid
the
sheets
in
her
bodice
she
seemed
to
be
listening
raoul
also
listened
whence
came
that
strange
sound
that
distant
rhythm
a
faint
singing
seemed
to
issue
from
the
walls
yes
it
was
as
though
the
walls
themselves
were
singing
the
song
became
plainer
the
words
were
now
distinguishable
he
heard
a
voice
a
very
beautiful
very
soft
very
captivating
voice
but
for
all
its
softness
it
remained
a
male
voice
the
voice
came
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
through
the
wall
it
approached
and
now
the
voice
was
in
the
room
in
front
of
christine
christine
rose
and
addressed
the
voice
as
though
speaking
to
some
one
here
i
am
erik
she
said
i
am
ready
but
you
are
late
raoul
peeping
from
behind
the
curtain
could
not
believe
his
eyes
which
showed
him
nothing
christine
face
lit
up
a
smile
of
happiness
appeared
upon
her
bloodless
lips
a
smile
like
that
of
sick
people
when
they
receive
the
first
hope
of
recovery
the
voice
without
a
body
went
on
singing
and
certainly
raoul
had
never
in
his
life
heard
anything
more
absolutely
and
heroically
sweet
more
gloriously
insidious
more
delicate
more
powerful
in
short
more
irresistibly
triumphant
he
listened
to
it
in
a
fever
and
he
now
began
to
understand
how
christine
daae
was
able
to
appear
one
evening
before
the
stupefied
audience
with
accents
of
a
beauty
hitherto
unknown
of
a
superhuman
exaltation
while
doubtless
still
under
the
influence
of
the
mysterious
and
invisible
master
the
voice
was
singing
the
song
from
romeo
and
juliet
raoul
saw
christine
stretch
out
her
arms
to
the
voice
as
she
had
done
in
perros
churchyard
to
the
invisible
violin
playing
the
resurrection
of
lazarus
and
nothing
could
describe
the
passion
with
which
the
voice
sang
fate
links
thee
to
me
for
ever
and
a
day
the
strains
went
through
raoul
heart
struggling
against
the
charm
that
seemed
to
deprive
him
of
all
his
will
and
all
his
energy
and
of
almost
all
his
lucidity
at
the
moment
when
he
needed
them
most
he
succeeded
in
drawing
back
the
curtain
that
hid
him
and
he
walked
to
where
christine
stood
she
herself
was
moving
to
the
back
of
the
room
the
whole
wall
of
which
was
occupied
by
a
great
mirror
that
reflected
her
image
but
not
his
for
he
was
just
behind
her
and
entirely
covered
by
her
fate
links
thee
to
me
for
ever
and
a
day
christine
walked
toward
her
image
in
the
glass
and
the
image
came
toward
her
the
two
christines
the
real
one
and
the
reflection
ended
by
touching
and
raoul
put
out
his
arms
to
clasp
the
two
in
one
embrace
but
by
a
sort
of
dazzling
miracle
that
sent
him
staggering
raoul
was
suddenly
flung
back
while
an
icy
blast
swept
over
his
face
he
saw
not
two
but
four
eight
twenty
christines
spinning
round
him
laughing
at
him
and
fleeing
so
swiftly
that
he
could
not
touch
one
of
them
at
last
everything
stood
still
again
and
he
saw
himself
in
the
glass
but
christine
had
disappeared
he
rushed
up
to
the
glass
he
struck
at
the
walls
nobody
and
meanwhile
the
room
still
echoed
with
a
distant
passionate
singing
fate
links
thee
to
me
for
ever
and
a
day
which
way
which
way
had
christine
gone
which
way
would
she
return
would
she
return
alas
had
she
not
declared
to
him
that
everything
was
finished
and
was
the
voice
not
repeating
fate
links
thee
to
me
for
ever
and
a
day
to
me
to
whom
then
worn
out
beaten
he
sat
down
on
the
chair
which
christine
had
just
left
like
her
he
let
his
head
fall
into
his
hands
when
he
raised
it
the
tears
were
streaming
down
his
young
cheeks
real
heavy
tears
like
those
which
jealous
children
shed
tears
that
wept
for
a
sorrow
which
was
in
no
way
fanciful
but
which
is
common
to
all
the
lovers
on
earth
and
which
he
expressed
aloud
who
is
this
erik
he
said
chapter
x
forget
the
name
of
the
man
voice
the
day
after
christine
had
vanished
before
his
eyes
in
a
sort
of
dazzlement
that
still
made
him
doubt
the
evidence
of
his
senses
le
vicomte
de
chagny
called
to
inquire
at
mamma
valerius
he
came
upon
a
charming
picture
christine
herself
was
seated
by
the
bedside
of
the
old
lady
who
was
sitting
up
against
the
pillows
knitting
the
pink
and
white
had
returned
to
the
young
girl
cheeks
the
dark
rings
round
her
eyes
had
disappeared
raoul
no
longer
recognized
the
tragic
face
of
the
day
before
if
the
veil
of
melancholy
over
those
adorable
features
had
not
still
appeared
to
the
young
man
as
the
last
trace
of
the
weird
drama
in
whose
toils
that
mysterious
child
was
struggling
he
could
have
believed
that
christine
was
not
its
heroine
at
all
she
rose
without
showing
any
emotion
and
offered
him
her
hand
but
raoul
stupefaction
was
so
great
that
he
stood
there
dumfounded
without
a
gesture
without
a
word
well
de
chagny
exclaimed
mamma
valerius
do
you
know
our
christine
her
good
genius
has
sent
her
back
to
us
mamma
the
girl
broke
in
promptly
while
a
deep
blush
mantled
to
her
eyes
i
thought
mamma
that
there
was
to
be
no
more
question
of
that
you
know
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
angel
of
music
but
child
he
gave
you
lessons
for
three
months
mamma
i
have
promised
to
explain
everything
to
you
one
of
these
days
and
i
hope
to
do
so
but
you
have
promised
me
until
that
day
to
be
silent
and
to
ask
me
no
more
questions
whatever
provided
that
you
promised
never
to
leave
me
again
but
have
you
promised
that
christine
mamma
all
this
can
not
interest
de
chagny
on
the
contrary
mademoiselle
said
the
young
man
in
a
voice
which
he
tried
to
make
firm
and
brave
but
which
still
trembled
anything
that
concerns
you
interests
me
to
an
extent
which
perhaps
you
will
one
day
understand
i
do
not
deny
that
my
surprise
equals
my
pleasure
at
finding
you
with
your
adopted
mother
and
that
after
what
happened
between
us
yesterday
after
what
you
said
and
what
i
was
able
to
guess
i
hardly
expected
to
see
you
here
so
soon
i
should
be
the
first
to
delight
at
your
return
if
you
were
not
so
bent
on
preserving
a
secrecy
that
may
be
fatal
to
you
and
i
have
been
your
friend
too
long
not
to
be
alarmed
with
mme
valerius
at
a
disastrous
adventure
which
will
remain
dangerous
so
long
as
we
have
not
unraveled
its
threads
and
of
which
you
will
certainly
end
by
being
the
victim
christine
at
these
words
mamma
valerius
tossed
about
in
her
bed
what
does
this
mean
she
cried
is
christine
in
danger
yes
madame
said
raoul
courageously
notwithstanding
the
signs
which
christine
made
to
him
my
god
exclaimed
the
good
simple
old
woman
gasping
for
breath
you
must
tell
me
everything
christine
why
did
you
try
to
reassure
me
and
what
danger
is
it
de
chagny
an
impostor
is
abusing
her
good
faith
is
the
angel
of
music
an
impostor
she
told
you
herself
that
there
is
no
angel
of
music
but
then
what
is
it
in
heaven
name
you
will
be
the
death
of
me
there
is
a
terrible
mystery
around
us
madame
around
you
around
christine
a
mystery
much
more
to
be
feared
than
any
number
of
ghosts
or
genii
mamma
valerius
turned
a
terrified
face
to
christine
who
had
already
run
to
her
adopted
mother
and
was
holding
her
in
her
arms
do
believe
him
mummy
do
believe
him
she
repeated
then
tell
me
that
you
will
never
leave
me
again
implored
the
widow
christine
was
silent
and
raoul
resumed
that
is
what
you
must
promise
christine
it
is
the
only
thing
that
can
reassure
your
mother
and
me
we
will
undertake
not
to
ask
you
a
single
question
about
the
past
if
you
promise
us
to
remain
under
our
protection
in
future
that
is
an
undertaking
which
i
have
not
asked
of
you
and
a
promise
which
i
refuse
to
make
you
said
the
young
girl
haughtily
i
am
mistress
of
my
own
actions
de
chagny
you
have
no
right
to
control
them
and
i
will
beg
you
to
desist
henceforth
as
to
what
i
have
done
during
the
last
fortnight
there
is
only
one
man
in
the
world
who
has
the
right
to
demand
an
account
of
me
my
husband
well
i
have
no
husband
and
i
never
mean
to
marry
she
threw
out
her
hands
to
emphasize
her
words
and
raoul
turned
pale
not
only
because
of
the
words
which
he
had
heard
but
because
he
had
caught
sight
of
a
plain
gold
ring
on
christine
finger
you
have
no
husband
and
yet
you
wear
a
he
tried
to
seize
her
hand
but
she
swiftly
drew
it
back
that
a
present
she
said
blushing
once
more
and
vainly
striving
to
hide
her
embarrassment
christine
as
you
have
no
husband
that
ring
can
only
have
been
given
by
one
who
hopes
to
make
you
his
wife
why
deceive
us
further
why
torture
me
still
more
that
ring
is
a
promise
and
that
promise
has
been
accepted
that
what
i
said
exclaimed
the
old
lady
and
what
did
she
answer
madame
what
i
chose
said
christine
driven
to
exasperation
do
you
think
monsieur
that
this
has
lasted
long
enough
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
raoul
was
afraid
to
let
her
finish
her
speech
he
interrupted
her
i
beg
your
pardon
for
speaking
as
i
did
mademoiselle
you
know
the
good
intentions
that
make
me
meddle
just
now
in
matters
which
you
no
doubt
think
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
but
allow
me
to
tell
you
what
i
have
seen
and
i
have
seen
more
than
you
suspect
christine
or
what
i
thought
i
saw
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
have
sometimes
been
inclined
to
doubt
the
evidence
of
my
eyes
well
what
did
you
see
sir
or
think
you
saw
i
saw
your
ecstasy
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
christine
the
voice
that
came
from
the
wall
or
the
next
room
to
yours
yes
your
ecstasy
and
that
is
what
makes
me
alarmed
on
your
behalf
you
are
under
a
very
dangerous
spell
and
yet
it
seems
that
you
are
aware
of
the
imposture
because
you
say
that
there
is
no
angel
of
music
in
that
case
christine
why
did
you
follow
him
that
time
why
did
you
stand
up
with
radiant
features
as
though
you
were
really
hearing
angels
ah
it
is
a
very
dangerous
voice
christine
for
i
myself
when
i
heard
it
was
so
much
fascinated
by
it
that
you
vanished
before
my
eyes
without
my
seeing
which
way
you
passed
christine
christine
in
the
name
of
heaven
in
the
name
of
your
father
who
is
in
heaven
now
and
who
loved
you
so
dearly
and
who
loved
me
too
christine
tell
us
tell
your
benefactress
and
me
to
whom
does
that
voice
belong
if
you
do
we
will
save
you
in
spite
of
yourself
come
christine
the
name
of
the
man
the
name
of
the
man
who
had
the
audacity
to
put
a
ring
on
your
finger
de
chagny
the
girl
declared
coldly
you
shall
never
know
thereupon
seeing
the
hostility
with
which
her
ward
had
addressed
the
viscount
mamma
valerius
suddenly
took
christine
part
and
if
she
does
love
that
man
monsieur
le
vicomte
even
then
it
is
no
business
of
yours
alas
madame
raoul
humbly
replied
unable
to
restrain
his
tears
alas
i
believe
that
christine
really
does
love
him
but
it
is
not
only
that
which
drives
me
to
despair
for
what
i
am
not
certain
of
madame
is
that
the
man
whom
christine
loves
is
worthy
of
her
love
it
is
for
me
to
be
the
judge
of
that
monsieur
said
christine
looking
raoul
angrily
in
the
face
when
a
man
continued
raoul
adopts
such
romantic
methods
to
entice
a
young
girl
affections
the
man
must
be
either
a
villain
or
the
girl
a
fool
is
that
it
christine
raoul
why
do
you
condemn
a
man
whom
you
have
never
seen
whom
no
one
knows
and
about
whom
you
yourself
know
nothing
yes
christine
yes
i
at
least
know
the
name
that
you
thought
to
keep
from
me
for
ever
the
name
of
your
angel
of
music
mademoiselle
is
erik
christine
at
once
betrayed
herself
she
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
stammered
who
told
you
you
yourself
how
do
you
mean
by
pitying
him
the
other
night
the
night
of
the
masked
ball
when
you
went
to
your
did
you
not
say
erik
well
christine
there
was
a
poor
raoul
who
overheard
you
this
is
the
second
time
that
you
have
listened
behind
the
door
de
chagny
i
was
not
behind
the
door
i
was
in
the
in
the
inner
room
mademoiselle
oh
unhappy
man
moaned
the
girl
showing
every
sign
of
unspeakable
terror
unhappy
man
do
you
want
to
be
killed
perhaps
raoul
uttered
this
perhaps
with
so
much
love
and
despair
in
his
voice
that
christine
could
not
keep
back
a
sob
she
took
his
hands
and
looked
at
him
with
all
the
pure
affection
of
which
she
was
capable
raoul
she
said
forget
the
man
voice
and
do
not
even
remember
its
name
you
must
never
try
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
the
man
voice
is
the
mystery
so
very
terrible
there
is
no
more
awful
mystery
on
this
earth
swear
to
me
that
you
will
make
no
attempt
to
find
out
she
insisted
swear
to
me
that
you
will
never
come
to
my
unless
i
send
for
you
then
you
promise
to
send
for
me
sometimes
christine
i
promise
when
then
i
swear
to
do
as
you
ask
he
kissed
her
hands
and
went
away
cursing
erik
and
resolving
to
be
patient
chapter
xi
above
the
the
next
day
he
saw
her
at
the
opera
she
was
still
wearing
the
plain
gold
ring
she
was
gentle
and
kind
to
him
she
talked
to
him
of
the
plans
which
he
was
forming
of
his
future
of
his
career
he
told
her
that
the
date
of
the
polar
expedition
had
been
put
forward
and
that
he
would
leave
france
in
three
weeks
or
a
month
at
latest
she
suggested
almost
gaily
that
he
must
look
upon
the
voyage
with
delight
as
a
stage
toward
his
coming
fame
and
when
he
replied
that
fame
without
love
was
no
attraction
in
his
eyes
she
treated
him
as
a
child
whose
sorrows
were
only
how
can
you
speak
so
lightly
of
such
serious
things
he
asked
perhaps
we
shall
never
see
each
other
again
i
may
die
during
that
expedition
or
i
she
said
simply
she
no
longer
smiled
or
jested
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
some
new
thing
that
had
entered
her
mind
for
the
first
time
her
eyes
were
all
aglow
with
it
what
are
you
thinking
of
christine
i
am
thinking
that
we
shall
not
see
each
other
again
and
does
that
make
you
so
radiant
and
that
in
a
month
we
shall
have
to
say
for
ever
unless
christine
we
pledge
our
faith
and
wait
for
each
other
for
ever
she
put
her
hand
on
his
mouth
hush
raoul
you
know
there
is
no
question
of
that
and
we
shall
never
be
married
that
is
understood
she
seemed
suddenly
almost
unable
to
contain
an
overpowering
gaiety
she
clapped
her
hands
with
childish
glee
raoul
stared
at
her
in
amazement
but
but
she
continued
holding
out
her
two
hands
to
raoul
or
rather
giving
them
to
him
as
though
she
had
suddenly
resolved
to
make
him
a
present
of
them
but
if
we
can
not
be
married
we
can
we
can
be
engaged
nobody
will
know
but
ourselves
raoul
there
have
been
plenty
of
secret
marriages
why
not
a
secret
engagement
we
are
engaged
dear
for
a
month
in
a
month
you
will
go
away
and
i
can
be
happy
at
the
thought
of
that
month
all
my
life
long
she
was
enchanted
with
her
inspiration
then
she
became
serious
again
this
she
said
is
a
happiness
that
will
harm
no
one
raoul
jumped
at
the
idea
he
bowed
to
christine
and
said
mademoiselle
i
have
the
honor
to
ask
for
your
hand
why
you
have
both
of
them
already
my
dear
betrothed
oh
raoul
how
happy
we
shall
be
we
must
play
at
being
engaged
all
day
long
it
was
the
prettiest
game
in
the
world
and
they
enjoyed
it
like
the
children
that
they
were
oh
the
wonderful
speeches
they
made
to
each
other
and
the
eternal
vows
they
exchanged
they
played
at
hearts
as
other
children
might
play
at
ball
only
as
it
was
really
their
two
hearts
that
they
flung
to
and
fro
they
had
to
be
very
very
handy
to
catch
them
each
time
without
hurting
them
one
day
about
a
week
after
the
game
began
raoul
heart
was
badly
hurt
and
he
stopped
playing
and
uttered
these
wild
words
i
sha
go
to
the
north
pole
christine
who
in
her
innocence
had
not
dreamed
of
such
a
possibility
suddenly
discovered
the
danger
of
the
game
and
reproached
herself
bitterly
she
did
not
say
a
word
in
reply
to
raoul
remark
and
went
straight
home
this
happened
in
the
afternoon
in
the
singer
where
they
met
every
day
and
where
they
amused
themselves
by
dining
on
three
biscuits
two
glasses
of
port
and
a
bunch
of
violets
in
the
evening
she
did
not
sing
and
he
did
not
receive
his
usual
letter
though
they
had
arranged
to
write
to
each
other
daily
during
that
month
the
next
morning
he
ran
off
to
mamma
valerius
who
told
him
that
christine
had
gone
away
for
two
days
she
had
left
at
five
the
day
before
raoul
was
distracted
he
hated
mamma
valerius
for
giving
him
such
news
as
that
with
such
stupefying
calmness
he
tried
to
sound
her
but
the
old
lady
obviously
knew
nothing
christine
returned
on
the
following
day
she
returned
in
triumph
she
renewed
her
extraordinary
success
of
the
gala
performance
since
the
adventure
of
the
toad
carlotta
had
not
been
able
to
appear
on
the
stage
the
terror
of
a
fresh
filled
her
heart
and
deprived
her
of
all
her
power
of
singing
and
the
theater
that
had
witnessed
her
incomprehensible
disgrace
had
become
odious
to
her
she
contrived
to
cancel
her
contract
daae
was
offered
the
vacant
place
for
the
time
she
received
thunders
of
applause
in
the
juive
the
viscount
who
of
course
was
present
was
the
only
one
to
suffer
on
hearing
the
thousand
echoes
of
this
fresh
triumph
for
christine
still
wore
her
plain
gold
ring
a
distant
voice
whispered
in
the
young
man
ear
she
is
wearing
the
ring
again
and
you
did
not
give
it
to
her
she
gave
her
soul
again
tonight
and
did
not
give
it
to
you
if
she
will
not
tell
you
what
she
has
been
doing
the
past
two
days
you
must
go
and
ask
erik
he
ran
behind
the
scenes
and
placed
himself
in
her
way
she
saw
him
for
her
eyes
were
looking
for
him
she
said
quick
quick
come
and
she
dragged
him
to
her
raoul
at
once
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
her
he
swore
to
her
that
he
would
go
and
he
entreated
her
never
again
to
withhold
a
single
hour
of
the
ideal
happiness
which
she
had
promised
him
she
let
her
tears
flow
they
kissed
like
a
despairing
brother
and
sister
who
have
been
smitten
with
a
common
loss
and
who
meet
to
mourn
a
dead
parent
suddenly
she
snatched
herself
from
the
young
man
soft
and
timid
embrace
seemed
to
listen
to
something
and
with
a
quick
gesture
pointed
to
the
door
when
he
was
on
the
threshold
she
said
in
so
low
a
voice
that
the
viscount
guessed
rather
than
heard
her
words
my
dear
betrothed
and
be
happy
raoul
i
sang
for
you
he
returned
the
next
day
but
those
two
days
of
absence
had
broken
the
charm
of
their
delightful
they
looked
at
each
other
in
the
with
their
sad
eyes
without
exchanging
a
word
raoul
had
to
restrain
himself
not
to
cry
out
i
am
jealous
i
am
jealous
i
am
jealous
but
she
heard
him
all
the
same
then
she
said
come
for
a
walk
dear
the
air
will
do
you
good
raoul
thought
that
she
would
propose
a
stroll
in
the
country
far
from
that
building
which
he
detested
as
a
prison
whose
jailer
he
could
feel
walking
within
the
walls
the
jailer
erik
but
she
took
him
to
the
stage
and
made
him
sit
on
the
wooden
curb
of
a
well
in
the
doubtful
peace
and
coolness
of
a
first
scene
set
for
the
performance
on
another
day
she
wandered
with
him
hand
in
hand
along
the
deserted
paths
of
a
garden
whose
creepers
had
been
cut
out
by
a
decorator
skilful
hands
it
was
as
though
the
real
sky
the
real
flowers
the
real
earth
were
forbidden
her
for
all
time
and
she
condemned
to
breathe
no
other
air
than
that
of
the
theater
an
occasional
fireman
passed
watching
over
their
melancholy
idyll
from
afar
and
she
would
drag
him
up
above
the
clouds
in
the
magnificent
disorder
of
the
grid
where
she
loved
to
make
him
giddy
by
running
in
front
of
him
along
the
frail
bridges
among
the
thousands
of
ropes
fastened
to
the
pulleys
the
windlasses
the
rollers
in
the
midst
of
a
regular
forest
of
yards
and
masts
if
he
hesitated
she
said
with
an
adorable
pout
of
her
lips
you
a
sailor
and
then
they
returned
to
terra
firma
that
is
to
say
to
some
passage
that
led
them
to
the
little
girls
where
brats
between
six
and
ten
were
practising
their
steps
in
the
hope
of
becoming
great
dancers
one
day
covered
with
diamonds
meanwhile
christine
gave
them
sweets
instead
she
took
him
to
the
wardrobe
and
took
him
all
over
her
empire
which
was
artificial
but
immense
covering
seventeen
stories
from
the
to
the
roof
and
inhabited
by
an
army
of
subjects
she
moved
among
them
like
a
popular
queen
encouraging
them
in
their
labors
sitting
down
in
the
workshops
giving
words
of
advice
to
the
workmen
whose
hands
hesitated
to
cut
into
the
rich
stuffs
that
were
to
clothe
heroes
there
were
inhabitants
of
that
country
who
practised
every
trade
there
were
cobblers
there
were
goldsmiths
all
had
learned
to
know
her
and
to
love
her
for
she
always
interested
herself
in
all
their
troubles
and
all
their
little
hobbies
she
knew
unsuspected
corners
that
were
secretly
occupied
by
little
old
couples
she
knocked
at
their
door
and
introduced
raoul
to
them
as
a
prince
charming
who
had
asked
for
her
hand
and
the
two
of
them
sitting
on
some
property
would
listen
to
the
legends
of
the
opera
even
as
in
their
childhood
they
had
listened
to
the
old
breton
tales
those
old
people
remembered
nothing
outside
the
opera
they
had
lived
there
for
years
without
number
past
managements
had
forgotten
them
palace
revolutions
had
taken
no
notice
of
them
the
history
of
france
had
run
its
course
unknown
to
them
and
nobody
recollected
their
existence
the
precious
days
sped
in
this
way
and
raoul
and
christine
by
affecting
excessive
interest
in
outside
matters
strove
awkwardly
to
hide
from
each
other
the
one
thought
of
their
hearts
one
fact
was
certain
that
christine
who
until
then
had
shown
herself
the
stronger
of
the
two
became
suddenly
inexpressibly
nervous
when
on
their
expeditions
she
would
start
running
without
reason
or
else
suddenly
stop
and
her
hand
turning
in
a
moment
would
hold
the
young
man
back
sometimes
her
eyes
seemed
to
pursue
imaginary
shadows
she
cried
this
way
and
this
way
and
this
way
laughing
a
breathless
laugh
that
often
ended
in
tears
then
raoul
tried
to
speak
to
question
her
in
spite
of
his
promises
but
even
before
he
had
worded
his
question
she
answered
feverishly
nothing
i
swear
it
is
nothing
once
when
they
were
passing
before
an
open
trapdoor
on
the
stage
raoul
stopped
over
the
dark
cavity
you
have
shown
me
over
the
upper
part
of
your
empire
christine
but
there
are
strange
stories
told
of
the
lower
part
shall
we
go
down
she
caught
him
in
her
arms
as
though
she
feared
to
see
him
disappear
down
the
black
hole
and
in
a
trembling
voice
whispered
never
i
will
not
have
you
go
there
besides
it
not
mine
everything
that
is
underground
belongs
to
him
raoul
looked
her
in
the
eyes
and
said
roughly
so
he
lives
down
there
does
he
i
never
said
so
who
told
you
a
thing
like
that
come
away
i
sometimes
wonder
if
you
are
quite
sane
raoul
you
always
take
things
in
such
an
impossible
way
come
along
come
and
she
literally
dragged
him
away
for
he
was
obstinate
and
wanted
to
remain
by
the
that
hole
attracted
him
suddenly
the
was
closed
and
so
quickly
that
they
did
not
even
see
the
hand
that
worked
it
and
they
remained
quite
dazed
perhaps
he
was
there
raoul
said
at
last
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
did
not
seem
easy
no
no
it
was
the
they
must
do
something
you
know
they
open
and
shut
the
without
any
particular
reason
it
like
the
they
must
spend
their
time
somehow
but
suppose
it
were
he
christine
no
no
he
has
shut
himself
up
he
is
working
oh
really
he
working
is
he
yes
he
ca
open
and
shut
the
and
work
at
the
same
time
she
shivered
what
is
he
working
at
oh
something
terrible
but
it
all
the
better
for
us
when
he
working
at
that
he
sees
nothing
he
does
not
eat
drink
or
breathe
for
days
and
nights
at
a
time
he
becomes
a
living
dead
man
and
has
no
time
to
amuse
himself
with
the
she
shivered
again
she
was
still
holding
him
in
her
arms
then
she
sighed
and
said
in
her
turn
suppose
it
were
he
are
you
afraid
of
him
no
no
of
course
not
she
said
for
all
that
on
the
next
day
and
the
following
days
christine
was
careful
to
avoid
the
her
agitation
only
increased
as
the
hours
passed
at
last
one
afternoon
she
arrived
very
late
with
her
face
so
desperately
pale
and
her
eyes
so
desperately
red
that
raoul
resolved
to
go
to
all
lengths
including
that
which
he
foreshadowed
when
he
blurted
out
that
he
would
not
go
on
the
north
pole
expedition
unless
she
first
told
him
the
secret
of
the
man
voice
hush
hush
in
heaven
name
suppose
he
heard
you
you
unfortunate
raoul
and
christine
eyes
stared
wildly
at
everything
around
her
i
will
remove
you
from
his
power
christine
i
swear
it
and
you
shall
not
think
of
him
any
more
is
it
possible
she
allowed
herself
this
doubt
which
was
an
encouragernent
while
dragging
the
young
man
up
to
the
topmost
floor
of
the
theater
far
very
far
from
the
i
shall
hide
you
in
some
unknown
corner
of
the
world
where
he
can
not
come
to
look
for
you
you
will
be
safe
and
then
i
shall
go
away
as
you
have
sworn
never
to
marry
christine
seized
raoul
hands
and
squeezed
them
with
incredible
rapture
but
suddenly
becoming
alarmed
again
she
turned
away
her
head
higher
was
all
she
said
higher
still
and
she
dragged
him
up
toward
the
summit
he
had
a
difficulty
in
following
her
they
were
soon
under
the
very
roof
in
the
maze
of
they
slipped
through
the
buttresses
the
rafters
the
joists
they
ran
from
beam
to
beam
as
they
might
have
run
from
tree
to
tree
in
a
forest
and
despite
the
care
which
she
took
to
look
behind
her
at
every
moment
she
failed
to
see
a
shadow
which
followed
her
like
her
own
shadow
which
stopped
when
she
stopped
which
started
again
when
she
did
and
which
made
no
more
noise
than
a
shadow
should
as
for
raoul
he
saw
nothing
either
for
when
he
had
christine
in
front
of
him
nothing
interested
him
that
happened
behind
chapter
xii
apollo
lyre
on
this
way
they
reached
the
roof
christine
tripped
over
it
as
lightly
as
a
swallow
their
eyes
swept
the
empty
space
between
the
three
domes
and
the
triangular
pediment
she
breathed
freely
over
paris
the
whole
valley
of
which
was
seen
at
work
below
she
called
raoul
to
come
quite
close
to
her
and
they
walked
side
by
side
along
the
zinc
streets
in
the
leaden
avenues
they
looked
at
their
twin
shapes
in
the
huge
tanks
full
of
stagnant
water
where
in
the
hot
weather
the
little
boys
of
the
ballet
a
score
or
so
learn
to
swim
and
dive
the
shadow
had
followed
behind
them
clinging
to
their
steps
and
the
two
children
little
suspected
its
presence
when
they
at
last
sat
down
trustingly
under
the
mighty
protection
of
apollo
who
with
a
great
bronze
gesture
lifted
his
huge
lyre
to
the
heart
of
a
crimson
sky
it
was
a
gorgeous
spring
evening
clouds
which
had
just
received
their
gossamer
robe
of
gold
and
purple
from
the
setting
sun
drifted
slowly
by
and
christine
said
to
raoul
soon
we
shall
go
farther
and
faster
than
the
clouds
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
then
you
will
leave
me
raoul
but
if
when
the
moment
comes
for
you
to
take
me
away
i
refuse
to
go
with
you
well
you
must
carry
me
off
by
force
are
you
afraid
that
you
will
change
your
mind
christine
i
do
know
she
said
shaking
her
head
in
an
odd
fashion
he
is
a
demon
and
she
shivered
and
nestled
in
his
arms
with
a
moan
i
am
afraid
now
of
going
back
to
live
with
him
in
the
ground
what
compels
you
to
go
back
christine
if
i
do
not
go
back
to
him
terrible
misfortunes
may
happen
but
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
do
it
i
know
one
ought
to
be
sorry
for
people
who
live
underground
but
he
is
too
horrible
and
yet
the
time
is
at
hand
i
have
only
a
day
left
and
if
i
do
not
go
he
will
come
and
fetch
me
with
his
voice
and
he
will
drag
me
with
him
underground
and
go
on
his
knees
before
me
with
his
death
head
and
he
will
tell
me
that
he
loves
me
and
he
will
cry
oh
those
tears
raoul
those
tears
in
the
two
black
of
the
death
head
i
can
not
see
those
tears
flow
again
she
wrung
her
hands
in
anguish
while
raoul
pressed
her
to
his
heart
no
no
you
shall
never
again
hear
him
tell
you
that
he
loves
you
you
shall
not
see
his
tears
let
us
fly
christine
let
us
fly
at
once
and
he
tried
to
drag
her
away
then
and
there
but
she
stopped
him
no
no
she
said
shaking
her
head
sadly
not
now
it
would
be
too
cruel
let
him
hear
me
sing
evening
and
then
we
will
go
away
you
must
come
and
fetch
me
in
my
at
midnight
exactly
he
will
then
be
waiting
for
me
in
the
by
the
lake
we
shall
be
free
and
you
shall
take
me
away
you
must
promise
me
that
raoul
even
if
i
refuse
for
i
feel
that
if
i
go
back
this
time
i
shall
perhaps
never
return
and
she
gave
a
sigh
to
which
it
seemed
to
her
that
another
sigh
behind
her
replied
did
you
hear
her
teeth
chattered
no
said
raoul
i
heard
nothing
it
is
too
terrible
she
confessed
to
be
always
trembling
like
this
and
yet
we
run
no
danger
here
we
are
at
home
in
the
sky
in
the
open
air
in
the
light
the
sun
is
flaming
and
can
not
bear
to
look
at
the
sun
i
have
never
seen
him
by
daylight
it
must
be
awful
oh
the
first
time
i
saw
him
i
thought
that
he
was
going
to
die
why
asked
raoul
really
frightened
at
the
aspect
which
this
strange
confidence
was
taking
because
i
had
seen
him
this
time
raoul
and
christine
turned
round
at
the
same
time
there
is
some
one
in
pain
said
raoul
perhaps
some
one
has
been
hurt
did
you
hear
i
ca
say
christine
confessed
even
when
he
is
not
there
my
ears
are
full
of
his
sighs
still
if
you
heard
they
stood
up
and
looked
around
them
they
were
quite
alone
on
the
immense
lead
roof
they
sat
down
again
and
raoul
said
tell
me
how
you
saw
him
first
i
had
heard
him
for
three
months
without
seeing
him
the
first
time
i
heard
it
i
thought
as
you
did
that
that
adorable
voice
was
singing
in
another
room
i
went
out
and
looked
everywhere
but
as
you
know
raoul
my
is
very
much
by
itself
and
i
could
not
find
the
voice
outside
my
room
whereas
it
went
on
steadily
inside
and
it
not
only
sang
but
it
spoke
to
me
and
answered
my
questions
like
a
real
man
voice
with
this
difference
that
it
was
as
beautiful
as
the
voice
of
an
angel
i
had
never
got
the
angel
of
music
whom
my
poor
father
had
promised
to
send
me
as
soon
as
he
was
dead
i
really
think
that
mamma
valerius
was
a
little
bit
to
blame
i
told
her
about
it
and
she
at
once
said
must
be
the
angel
at
any
rate
you
can
do
no
harm
by
asking
him
i
did
so
and
the
man
voice
replied
that
yes
it
was
the
angel
voice
the
voice
which
i
was
expecting
and
which
my
father
had
promised
me
from
that
time
onward
the
voice
and
i
became
great
friends
it
asked
leave
to
give
me
lessons
every
day
i
agreed
and
never
failed
to
keep
the
appointment
which
it
gave
me
in
my
you
have
no
idea
though
you
have
heard
the
voice
of
what
those
lessons
were
like
no
i
have
no
idea
said
raoul
what
was
your
accompaniment
we
were
accompanied
by
a
music
which
i
do
not
know
it
was
behind
the
wall
and
wonderfully
accurate
the
voice
seemed
to
understand
mine
exactly
to
know
precisely
where
my
father
had
left
off
teaching
me
in
a
few
weeks
time
i
hardly
knew
myself
when
i
sang
i
was
even
frightened
i
seemed
to
dread
a
sort
of
witchcraft
behind
it
but
mamma
valerius
reassured
me
she
said
that
she
knew
i
was
much
too
simple
a
girl
to
give
the
devil
a
hold
on
me
my
progress
by
the
voice
own
order
was
kept
a
secret
between
the
voice
mamma
valerius
and
myself
it
was
a
curious
thing
but
outside
the
i
sang
with
my
ordinary
voice
and
nobody
noticed
anything
i
did
all
that
the
voice
asked
it
said
and
see
we
shall
astonish
paris
and
i
waited
and
lived
on
in
a
sort
of
ecstatic
dream
it
was
then
that
i
saw
you
for
the
first
time
one
evening
in
the
house
i
was
so
glad
that
i
never
thought
of
concealing
my
delight
when
i
reached
my
unfortunately
the
voice
was
there
before
me
and
soon
noticed
by
my
air
that
something
had
happened
it
asked
what
was
the
matter
and
i
saw
no
reason
for
keeping
our
story
secret
or
concealing
the
place
which
you
filled
in
my
heart
then
the
voice
was
silent
i
called
to
it
but
it
did
not
reply
i
begged
and
entreated
but
in
vain
i
was
terrified
lest
it
had
gone
for
good
i
wish
to
heaven
it
had
dear
that
night
i
went
home
in
a
desperate
condition
i
told
mamma
valerius
who
said
of
course
the
voice
is
jealous
and
that
dear
first
revealed
to
me
that
i
loved
you
christine
stopped
and
laid
her
head
on
raoul
shoulder
they
sat
like
that
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
they
did
not
see
did
not
perceive
the
movement
at
a
few
steps
from
them
of
the
creeping
shadow
of
two
great
black
wings
a
shadow
that
came
along
the
roof
so
near
so
near
them
that
it
could
have
stifled
them
by
closing
over
them
the
next
day
christine
continued
with
a
sigh
i
went
back
to
my
in
a
very
pensive
frame
of
mind
the
voice
was
there
spoke
to
me
with
great
sadness
and
told
me
plainly
that
if
i
must
bestow
my
heart
on
earth
there
was
nothing
for
the
voice
to
do
but
to
go
back
to
heaven
and
it
said
this
with
such
an
accent
of
human
sorrow
that
i
ought
then
and
there
to
have
suspected
and
begun
to
believe
that
i
was
the
victim
of
my
deluded
senses
but
my
faith
in
the
voice
with
which
the
memory
of
my
father
was
so
closely
intermingled
remained
undisturbed
i
feared
nothing
so
much
as
that
i
might
never
hear
it
again
i
had
thought
about
my
love
for
you
and
realized
all
the
useless
danger
of
it
and
i
did
not
even
know
if
you
remembered
me
whatever
happened
your
position
in
society
forbade
me
to
contemplate
the
possibility
of
ever
marrying
you
and
i
swore
to
the
voice
that
you
were
no
more
than
a
brother
to
me
nor
ever
would
be
and
that
my
heart
was
incapable
of
any
earthly
love
and
that
dear
was
why
i
refused
to
recognize
or
see
you
when
i
met
you
on
the
stage
or
in
the
passages
meanwhile
the
hours
during
which
the
voice
taught
me
were
spent
in
a
divine
frenzy
until
at
last
the
voice
said
to
me
can
now
christine
daae
give
to
men
a
little
of
the
music
of
heaven
i
do
know
how
it
was
that
carlotta
did
not
come
to
the
theater
that
night
nor
why
i
was
called
upon
to
sing
in
her
stead
but
i
sang
with
a
rapture
i
had
never
known
before
and
i
felt
for
a
moment
as
if
my
soul
were
leaving
my
body
oh
christine
said
raoul
my
heart
quivered
that
night
at
every
accent
of
your
voice
i
saw
the
tears
stream
down
your
cheeks
and
i
wept
with
you
how
could
you
sing
sing
like
that
while
crying
i
felt
myself
fainting
said
christine
i
closed
my
eyes
when
i
opened
them
you
were
by
my
side
but
the
voice
was
there
also
raoul
i
was
afraid
for
your
sake
and
again
i
would
not
recognize
you
and
began
to
laugh
when
you
reminded
me
that
you
had
picked
up
my
scarf
in
the
sea
alas
there
is
no
deceiving
the
voice
the
voice
recognized
you
and
the
voice
was
jealous
it
said
that
if
i
did
not
love
you
i
would
not
avoid
you
but
treat
you
like
any
other
old
friend
it
made
me
scene
upon
scene
at
last
i
said
to
the
voice
will
do
i
am
going
to
perros
to
pray
on
my
grave
and
i
shall
ask
raoul
de
chagny
to
go
with
me
as
you
please
replied
the
voice
i
shall
be
at
perros
too
for
i
am
wherever
you
are
christine
and
if
you
are
still
worthy
of
me
if
you
have
not
lied
to
me
i
will
play
you
the
resurrection
of
lazarus
on
the
stroke
of
midnight
on
your
father
tomb
and
on
your
violin
that
dear
was
how
i
came
to
write
you
the
letter
that
brought
you
to
perros
how
could
i
have
been
so
beguiled
how
was
it
when
i
saw
the
personal
the
selfish
point
of
view
of
the
voice
that
i
did
not
suspect
some
impostor
alas
i
was
no
longer
mistress
of
myself
i
had
become
his
thing
but
after
all
cried
raoul
you
soon
came
to
know
the
truth
why
did
you
not
at
once
rid
yourself
of
that
abominable
nightmare
know
the
truth
raoul
rid
myself
of
that
nightmare
but
my
poor
boy
i
was
not
caught
in
the
nightmare
until
the
day
when
i
learned
the
truth
pity
me
raoul
pity
me
you
remember
the
terrible
evening
when
carlotta
thought
that
she
had
been
turned
into
a
toad
on
the
stage
and
when
the
house
was
suddenly
plunged
in
darkness
through
the
chandelier
crashing
to
the
floor
there
were
killed
and
wounded
that
night
and
the
whole
theater
rang
with
terrified
screams
my
first
thought
was
for
you
and
the
voice
i
was
at
once
easy
where
you
were
concerned
for
i
had
seen
you
in
your
brother
box
and
i
knew
that
you
were
not
in
danger
but
the
voice
had
told
me
that
it
would
be
at
the
performance
and
i
was
really
afraid
for
it
just
as
if
it
had
been
an
ordinary
person
who
was
capable
of
dying
i
thought
to
myself
chandelier
may
have
come
down
upon
the
voice
i
was
then
on
the
stage
and
was
nearly
running
into
the
house
to
look
for
the
voice
among
the
killed
and
wounded
when
i
thought
that
if
the
voice
was
safe
it
would
be
sure
to
be
in
my
and
i
rushed
to
my
room
the
voice
was
not
there
i
locked
my
door
and
with
tears
in
my
eyes
besought
it
if
it
were
still
alive
to
manifest
itself
to
me
the
voice
did
not
reply
but
suddenly
i
heard
a
long
beautiful
wail
which
i
knew
well
it
is
the
plaint
of
lazarus
when
at
the
sound
of
the
redeemer
voice
he
begins
to
open
his
eyes
and
see
the
light
of
day
it
was
the
music
which
you
and
i
raoul
heard
at
perros
and
then
the
voice
began
to
sing
the
leading
phrase
and
believe
in
me
whoso
believes
in
me
shall
live
walk
whoso
hath
believed
in
me
shall
never
die
i
can
not
tell
you
the
effect
which
that
music
had
upon
me
it
seemed
to
command
me
personally
to
come
to
stand
up
and
come
to
it
it
retreated
and
i
followed
and
believe
in
me
i
believed
in
it
i
came
i
came
and
this
was
the
extraordinary
thing
my
as
i
moved
seemed
to
lengthen
out
to
lengthen
out
evidently
it
must
have
been
an
effect
of
mirrors
for
i
had
the
mirror
in
front
of
me
and
suddenly
i
was
outside
the
room
without
knowing
how
what
without
knowing
how
christine
christine
you
must
really
stop
dreaming
i
was
not
dreaming
dear
i
was
outside
my
room
without
knowing
how
you
who
saw
me
disappear
from
my
room
one
evening
may
be
able
to
explain
it
but
i
can
not
i
can
only
tell
you
that
suddenly
there
was
no
mirror
before
me
and
no
i
was
in
a
dark
passage
i
was
frightened
and
i
cried
out
it
was
quite
dark
but
for
a
faint
red
glimmer
at
a
distant
corner
of
the
wall
i
tried
out
my
voice
was
the
only
sound
for
the
singing
and
the
violin
had
stopped
and
suddenly
a
hand
was
laid
on
mine
or
rather
a
bony
thing
that
seized
my
wrist
and
did
not
let
go
i
cried
out
again
an
arm
took
me
round
the
waist
and
supported
me
i
struggled
for
a
little
while
and
then
gave
up
the
attempt
i
was
dragged
toward
the
little
red
light
and
then
i
saw
that
i
was
in
the
hands
of
a
man
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
and
wearing
a
mask
that
hid
his
whole
face
i
made
one
last
effort
my
limbs
stiffened
my
mouth
opened
to
scream
but
a
hand
closed
it
a
hand
which
i
felt
on
my
lips
on
my
skin
a
hand
that
smelt
of
death
then
i
fainted
away
when
i
opened
my
eyes
we
were
still
surrounded
by
darkness
a
lantern
standing
on
the
ground
showed
a
bubbling
well
the
water
splashing
from
the
well
disappeared
almost
at
once
under
the
floor
on
which
i
was
lying
with
my
head
on
the
knee
of
the
man
in
the
black
cloak
and
the
black
mask
he
was
bathing
my
temples
and
his
hands
smelt
of
death
i
tried
to
push
them
away
and
asked
are
you
where
is
the
voice
his
only
answer
was
a
sigh
suddenly
a
hot
breath
passed
over
my
face
and
i
perceived
a
white
shape
beside
the
man
black
shape
in
the
darkness
the
black
shape
lifted
me
on
to
the
white
shape
a
glad
neighing
greeted
my
astounded
ears
and
i
murmured
the
animal
quivered
raoul
i
was
lying
half
back
on
a
saddle
and
i
had
recognized
the
white
horse
out
of
the
profeta
which
i
had
so
often
fed
with
sugar
and
sweets
i
remembered
that
one
evening
there
was
a
rumor
in
the
theater
that
the
horse
had
disappeared
and
that
it
had
been
stolen
by
the
opera
ghost
i
believed
in
the
voice
but
had
never
believed
in
the
ghost
now
however
i
began
to
wonder
with
a
shiver
whether
i
was
the
ghost
prisoner
i
called
upon
the
voice
to
help
me
for
i
should
never
have
imagined
that
the
voice
and
the
ghost
were
one
you
have
heard
about
the
opera
ghost
have
you
not
raoul
yes
but
tell
me
what
happened
when
you
were
on
the
white
horse
of
the
profeta
i
made
no
movement
and
let
myself
go
the
black
shape
held
me
up
and
i
made
no
effort
to
escape
a
curious
feeling
of
peacefulness
came
over
me
and
i
thought
that
i
must
be
under
the
influence
of
some
cordial
i
had
the
full
command
of
my
senses
and
my
eyes
became
used
to
the
darkness
which
was
lit
here
and
there
by
fitful
gleams
i
calculated
that
we
were
in
a
narrow
circular
gallery
probably
running
all
round
the
opera
which
is
immense
underground
i
had
once
been
down
into
those
cellars
but
had
stopped
at
the
third
floor
though
there
were
two
lower
still
large
enough
to
hold
a
town
but
the
figures
of
which
i
caught
sight
had
made
me
run
away
there
are
demons
down
there
quite
black
standing
in
front
of
boilers
and
they
wield
shovels
and
pitchforks
and
poke
up
fires
and
stir
up
flames
and
if
you
come
too
near
them
they
frighten
you
by
suddenly
opening
the
red
mouths
of
their
furnaces
well
while
cesar
was
quietly
carrying
me
on
his
back
i
saw
those
black
demons
in
the
distance
looking
quite
small
in
front
of
the
red
fires
of
their
furnaces
they
came
into
sight
disappeared
and
came
into
sight
again
as
we
went
on
our
winding
way
at
last
they
disappeared
altogether
the
shape
was
still
holding
me
up
and
cesar
walked
on
unled
and
i
could
not
tell
you
even
approximately
how
long
this
ride
lasted
i
only
know
that
we
seemed
to
turn
and
turn
and
often
went
down
a
spiral
stair
into
the
very
heart
of
the
earth
even
then
it
may
be
that
my
head
was
turning
but
i
do
think
so
no
my
mind
was
quite
clear
at
last
cesar
raised
his
nostrils
sniffed
the
air
and
quickened
his
pace
a
little
i
felt
a
moistness
in
the
air
and
cesar
stopped
the
darkness
had
lifted
a
sort
of
bluey
light
surrounded
us
we
were
on
the
edge
of
a
lake
whose
leaden
waters
stretched
into
the
distance
into
the
darkness
but
the
blue
light
lit
up
the
bank
and
i
saw
a
little
boat
fastened
to
an
iron
ring
on
the
wharf
a
boat
yes
but
i
knew
that
all
that
existed
and
that
there
was
nothing
supernatural
about
that
underground
lake
and
boat
but
think
of
the
exceptional
conditions
in
which
i
arrived
upon
that
shore
i
know
whether
the
effects
of
the
cordial
had
worn
off
when
the
shape
lifted
me
into
the
boat
but
my
terror
began
all
over
again
my
gruesome
escort
must
have
noticed
it
for
he
sent
cesar
back
and
i
heard
his
hoofs
trampling
up
a
staircase
while
the
man
jumped
into
the
boat
untied
the
rope
that
held
it
and
seized
the
oars
he
rowed
with
a
quick
powerful
stroke
and
his
eyes
under
the
mask
never
left
me
we
slipped
across
the
noiseless
water
in
the
bluey
light
which
i
told
you
of
then
we
were
in
the
dark
again
and
we
touched
shore
and
i
was
once
more
taken
up
in
the
man
arms
i
cried
aloud
and
then
suddenly
i
was
silent
dazed
by
the
light
yes
a
dazzling
light
in
the
midst
of
which
i
had
been
put
down
i
sprang
to
my
feet
i
was
in
the
middle
of
a
that
seemed
to
me
to
be
decorated
adorned
and
furnished
with
nothing
but
flowers
flowers
both
magnificent
and
stupid
because
of
the
silk
ribbons
that
tied
them
to
baskets
like
those
which
they
sell
in
the
shops
on
the
boulevards
they
were
much
too
civilized
flowers
like
those
which
i
used
to
find
in
my
after
a
first
night
and
in
the
midst
of
all
these
flowers
stood
the
black
shape
of
the
man
in
the
mask
with
arms
crossed
and
he
said
be
afraid
christine
you
are
in
no
danger
it
was
the
voice
my
anger
equaled
my
amazement
i
rushed
at
the
mask
and
tried
to
snatch
it
away
so
as
to
see
the
face
of
the
voice
the
man
said
are
in
no
danger
so
long
as
you
do
not
touch
the
mask
and
taking
me
gently
by
the
wrists
he
forced
me
into
a
chair
and
then
went
down
on
his
knees
before
me
and
said
nothing
more
his
humility
gave
me
back
some
of
my
courage
and
the
light
restored
me
to
the
realties
of
life
however
extraordinary
the
adventure
might
be
i
was
now
surrounded
by
mortal
visible
tangible
things
the
furniture
the
hangings
the
candles
the
vases
and
the
very
flowers
in
their
baskets
of
which
i
could
almost
have
told
whence
they
came
and
what
they
cost
were
bound
to
confine
my
imagination
to
the
limits
of
a
quite
as
commonplace
as
any
that
at
least
had
the
excuse
of
not
being
in
the
cellars
of
the
opera
i
had
no
doubt
to
do
with
a
terrible
eccentric
person
who
in
some
mysterious
fashion
had
succeeded
in
taking
up
his
abode
there
under
the
opera
house
five
stories
below
the
level
of
the
ground
and
the
voice
the
voice
which
i
had
recognized
under
the
mask
was
on
its
knees
before
me
was
a
man
and
i
began
to
cry
the
man
still
kneeling
must
have
understood
the
cause
of
my
tears
for
he
said
is
true
christine
i
am
not
an
angel
nor
a
genius
nor
a
ghost
i
am
erik
christine
narrative
was
again
interrupted
an
echo
behind
them
seemed
to
repeat
the
word
after
her
erik
what
echo
they
both
turned
round
and
saw
that
night
had
fallen
raoul
made
a
movement
as
though
to
rise
but
christine
kept
him
beside
her
do
go
she
said
i
want
you
to
know
everything
here
but
why
here
christine
i
am
afraid
of
your
catching
cold
we
have
nothing
to
fear
except
the
dear
and
here
we
are
miles
away
from
the
and
i
am
not
allowed
to
see
you
outside
the
theater
this
is
not
the
time
to
annoy
him
we
must
not
arouse
his
suspicion
christine
christine
something
tells
me
that
we
are
wrong
to
wait
till
evening
and
that
we
ought
to
fly
at
once
i
tell
you
that
if
he
does
not
hear
me
sing
tomorrow
it
will
cause
him
infinite
pain
it
is
difficult
not
to
cause
him
pain
and
yet
to
escape
from
him
for
good
you
are
right
in
that
raoul
for
certainly
he
will
die
of
my
flight
and
she
added
in
a
dull
voice
but
then
it
counts
both
ways
for
we
risk
his
killing
us
does
he
love
you
so
much
he
would
commit
murder
for
me
but
one
can
find
out
where
he
lives
one
can
go
in
search
of
him
now
that
we
know
that
erik
is
not
a
ghost
one
can
speak
to
him
and
force
him
to
answer
christine
shook
her
head
no
no
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
with
erik
except
to
run
away
then
why
when
you
were
able
to
run
away
did
you
go
back
to
him
because
i
had
to
and
you
will
understand
that
when
i
tell
you
how
i
left
him
oh
i
hate
him
cried
raoul
and
you
christine
tell
me
do
you
hate
him
too
no
said
christine
simply
no
of
course
not
why
you
love
him
your
fear
your
terror
all
of
that
is
just
love
and
love
of
the
most
exquisite
kind
the
kind
which
people
do
not
admit
even
to
themselves
said
raoul
bitterly
the
kind
that
gives
you
a
thrill
when
you
think
of
it
picture
it
a
man
who
lives
in
a
palace
underground
and
he
gave
a
leer
then
you
want
me
to
go
back
there
said
the
young
girl
cruelly
take
care
raoul
i
have
told
you
i
should
never
return
there
was
an
appalling
silence
between
the
three
of
them
the
two
who
spoke
and
the
shadow
that
listened
behind
them
before
answering
that
said
raoul
at
last
speaking
very
slowly
i
should
like
to
know
with
what
feeling
he
inspires
you
since
you
do
not
hate
him
with
horror
she
said
that
is
the
terrible
thing
about
it
he
fills
me
with
horror
and
i
do
not
hate
him
how
can
i
hate
him
raoul
think
of
erik
at
my
feet
in
the
house
on
the
lake
underground
he
accuses
himself
he
curses
himself
he
implores
my
forgiveness
he
confesses
his
cheat
he
loves
me
he
lays
at
my
feet
an
immense
and
tragic
love
he
has
carried
me
off
for
love
he
has
imprisoned
me
with
him
underground
for
love
but
he
respects
me
he
crawls
he
moans
he
weeps
and
when
i
stood
up
raoul
and
told
him
that
i
could
only
despise
him
if
he
did
not
then
and
there
give
me
my
liberty
he
offered
it
he
offered
to
show
me
the
mysterious
road
only
only
he
rose
too
and
i
was
made
to
remember
that
though
he
was
not
an
angel
nor
a
ghost
nor
a
genius
he
remained
the
voice
for
he
sang
and
i
listened
and
stayed
that
night
we
did
not
exchange
another
word
he
sang
me
to
sleep
when
i
woke
up
i
was
alone
lying
on
a
sofa
in
a
simply
furnished
little
bedroom
with
an
ordinary
mahogany
bedstead
lit
by
a
lamp
standing
on
the
marble
top
of
an
old
chest
of
drawers
i
soon
discovered
that
i
was
a
prisoner
and
that
the
only
outlet
from
my
room
led
to
a
very
comfortable
on
returning
to
the
bedroom
i
saw
on
the
chest
of
drawers
a
note
in
red
ink
which
said
dear
christine
you
need
have
no
concern
as
to
your
fate
you
have
no
better
nor
more
respectful
friend
in
the
world
than
myself
you
are
alone
at
present
in
this
home
which
is
yours
i
am
going
out
shopping
to
fetch
you
all
the
things
that
you
can
need
i
felt
sure
that
i
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
madman
i
ran
round
my
little
apartment
looking
for
a
way
of
escape
which
i
could
not
find
i
upbraided
myself
for
my
absurd
superstition
which
had
caused
me
to
fall
into
the
trap
i
felt
inclined
to
laugh
and
to
cry
at
the
same
time
this
was
the
state
of
mind
in
which
erik
found
me
after
giving
three
taps
on
the
wall
he
walked
in
quietly
through
a
door
which
i
had
not
noticed
and
which
he
left
open
he
had
his
arms
full
of
boxes
and
parcels
and
arranged
them
on
the
bed
in
a
leisurely
fashion
while
i
overwhelmed
him
with
abuse
and
called
upon
him
to
take
off
his
mask
if
it
covered
the
face
of
an
honest
man
he
replied
serenely
shall
never
see
erik
face
and
he
reproached
me
with
not
having
finished
dressing
at
that
time
of
day
he
was
good
enough
to
tell
me
that
it
was
two
in
the
afternoon
he
said
he
would
give
me
half
an
hour
and
while
he
spoke
wound
up
my
watch
and
set
it
for
me
after
which
he
asked
me
to
come
to
the
where
a
nice
lunch
was
waiting
for
us
i
was
very
angry
slammed
the
door
in
his
face
and
went
to
the
when
i
came
out
again
feeling
greatly
refreshed
erik
said
that
he
loved
me
but
that
he
would
never
tell
me
so
except
when
i
allowed
him
and
that
the
rest
of
the
time
would
be
devoted
to
music
do
you
mean
by
the
rest
of
the
time
i
asked
days
he
said
with
decision
i
asked
him
if
i
should
then
be
free
and
he
said
will
be
free
christine
for
when
those
five
days
are
past
you
will
have
learned
not
to
see
me
and
then
from
time
to
time
you
will
come
to
see
your
poor
erik
he
pointed
to
a
chair
opposite
him
at
a
small
table
and
i
sat
down
feeling
greatly
perturbed
however
i
ate
a
few
prawns
and
the
wing
of
a
chicken
and
drank
half
a
glass
of
tokay
which
he
had
himself
he
told
me
brought
from
the
konigsberg
cellars
erik
did
not
eat
or
drink
i
asked
him
what
his
nationality
was
and
if
that
name
of
erik
did
not
point
to
his
scandinavian
origin
he
said
that
he
had
no
name
and
no
country
and
that
he
had
taken
the
name
of
erik
by
accident
after
lunch
he
rose
and
gave
me
the
tips
of
his
fingers
saying
he
would
like
to
show
me
over
his
flat
but
i
snatched
away
my
hand
and
gave
a
cry
what
i
had
touched
was
cold
and
at
the
same
time
bony
and
i
remembered
that
his
hands
smelt
of
death
forgive
me
he
moaned
and
he
opened
a
door
before
me
is
my
bedroom
if
you
care
to
see
it
it
is
rather
curious
his
manners
his
words
his
attitude
gave
me
confidence
and
i
went
in
without
hesitation
i
felt
as
if
i
were
entering
the
room
of
a
dead
person
the
walls
were
all
hung
with
black
but
instead
of
the
white
trimmings
that
usually
set
off
that
funereal
upholstery
there
was
an
enormous
stave
of
music
with
the
notes
of
the
dies
irae
many
times
repeated
in
the
middle
of
the
room
was
a
canopy
from
which
hung
curtains
of
red
brocaded
stuff
and
under
the
canopy
an
open
coffin
is
where
i
sleep
said
erik
has
to
get
used
to
everything
in
life
even
to
eternity
the
sight
upset
me
so
much
that
i
turned
away
my
head
then
i
saw
the
keyboard
of
an
organ
which
filled
one
whole
side
of
the
walls
on
the
desk
was
a
covered
with
red
notes
i
asked
leave
to
look
at
it
and
read
juan
triumphant
he
said
compose
sometimes
i
began
that
work
twenty
years
ago
when
i
have
finished
i
shall
take
it
away
with
me
in
that
coffin
and
never
wake
up
again
must
work
at
it
as
seldom
as
you
can
i
said
he
replied
sometimes
work
at
it
for
fourteen
days
and
nights
together
during
which
i
live
on
music
only
and
then
i
rest
for
years
at
a
time
you
play
me
something
out
of
your
don
juan
triumphant
i
asked
thinking
to
please
him
must
never
ask
me
that
he
said
in
a
gloomy
voice
will
play
you
mozart
if
you
like
which
will
only
make
you
weep
but
my
don
juan
christine
burns
and
yet
he
is
not
struck
by
fire
from
heaven
thereupon
we
returned
to
the
i
noticed
that
there
was
no
mirror
in
the
whole
apartment
i
was
going
to
remark
upon
this
but
erik
had
already
sat
down
to
the
piano
he
said
see
christine
there
is
some
music
that
is
so
terrible
that
it
consumes
all
those
who
approach
it
fortunately
you
have
not
come
to
that
music
yet
for
you
would
lose
all
your
pretty
coloring
and
nobody
would
know
you
when
you
returned
to
paris
let
us
sing
something
from
the
opera
christine
daae
he
spoke
these
last
words
as
though
he
were
flinging
an
insult
at
me
what
did
you
do
i
had
no
time
to
think
about
the
meaning
he
put
into
his
words
we
at
once
began
the
duet
in
othello
and
already
the
catastrophe
was
upon
us
i
sang
desdemona
with
a
despair
a
terror
which
i
had
never
displayed
before
as
for
him
his
voice
thundered
forth
his
revengeful
soul
at
every
note
love
jealousy
hatred
burst
out
around
us
in
harrowing
cries
erik
black
mask
made
me
think
of
the
natural
mask
of
the
moor
of
venice
he
was
othello
himself
suddenly
i
felt
a
need
to
see
beneath
the
mask
i
wanted
to
know
the
face
of
the
voice
and
with
a
movement
which
i
was
utterly
unable
to
control
swiftly
my
fingers
tore
away
the
mask
oh
horror
horror
horror
christine
stopped
at
the
thought
of
the
vision
that
had
scared
her
while
the
echoes
of
the
night
which
had
repeated
the
name
of
erik
now
thrice
moaned
the
cry
horror
horror
horror
raoul
and
christine
clasping
each
other
closely
raised
their
eyes
to
the
stars
that
shone
in
a
clear
and
peaceful
sky
raoul
said
strange
christine
that
this
calm
soft
night
should
be
so
full
of
plaintive
sounds
one
would
think
that
it
was
sorrowing
with
us
when
you
know
the
secret
raoul
your
ears
like
mine
will
be
full
of
lamentations
she
took
raoul
protecting
hands
in
hers
and
with
a
long
shiver
continued
yes
if
i
lived
to
be
a
hundred
i
should
always
hear
the
superhuman
cry
of
grief
and
rage
which
he
uttered
when
the
terrible
sight
appeared
before
my
eyes
raoul
you
have
seen
death
heads
when
they
have
been
dried
and
withered
by
the
centuries
and
perhaps
if
you
were
not
the
victim
of
a
nightmare
you
saw
his
death
head
at
perros
and
then
you
saw
red
death
stalking
about
at
the
last
masked
ball
but
all
those
death
heads
were
motionless
and
their
dumb
horror
was
not
alive
but
imagine
if
you
can
red
death
mask
suddenly
coming
to
life
in
order
to
express
with
the
four
black
holes
of
its
eyes
its
nose
and
its
mouth
the
extreme
anger
the
mighty
fury
of
a
demon
and
not
a
ray
of
light
from
the
sockets
for
as
i
learned
later
you
can
not
see
his
blazing
eyes
except
in
the
dark
i
fell
back
against
the
wall
and
he
came
up
to
me
grinding
his
teeth
and
as
i
fell
upon
my
knees
he
hissed
mad
incoherent
words
and
curses
at
me
leaning
over
me
he
cried
you
want
to
see
see
feast
your
eyes
glut
your
soul
on
my
cursed
ugliness
look
at
face
now
you
know
the
face
of
the
voice
you
were
not
content
to
hear
me
eh
you
wanted
to
know
what
i
looked
like
oh
you
women
are
so
inquisitive
well
are
you
satisfied
i
a
very
fellow
eh
when
a
woman
has
seen
me
as
you
have
she
belongs
to
me
she
loves
me
for
ever
i
am
a
kind
of
don
juan
you
know
and
drawing
himself
up
to
his
full
height
with
his
hand
on
his
hip
wagging
the
hideous
thing
that
was
his
head
on
his
shoulders
he
roared
at
me
i
am
don
juan
triumphant
and
when
i
turned
away
my
head
and
begged
for
mercy
he
drew
it
to
him
brutally
twisting
his
dead
fingers
into
my
hair
enough
enough
cried
raoul
i
will
kill
him
in
heaven
name
christine
tell
me
where
the
on
the
lake
is
i
must
kill
him
oh
be
quiet
raoul
if
you
want
to
know
yes
i
want
to
know
how
and
why
you
went
back
i
must
know
but
in
any
case
i
will
kill
him
oh
raoul
listen
listen
he
dragged
me
by
my
hair
and
then
and
then
oh
it
is
too
horrible
well
what
out
with
it
exclaimed
raoul
fiercely
out
with
it
quick
then
he
hissed
at
me
i
frighten
you
do
i
i
dare
say
perhaps
you
think
that
i
have
another
mask
eh
and
that
this
this
my
head
is
a
mask
well
he
roared
it
off
as
you
did
the
other
come
come
along
i
insist
your
hands
your
hands
give
me
your
hands
and
he
seized
my
hands
and
dug
them
into
his
awful
face
he
tore
his
flesh
with
my
nails
tore
his
terrible
dead
flesh
with
my
nails
he
shouted
while
his
throat
throbbed
and
panted
like
a
furnace
that
i
am
built
up
of
death
from
head
to
foot
and
that
it
is
a
corpse
that
loves
you
and
adores
you
and
will
never
never
leave
you
look
i
am
not
laughing
now
i
am
crying
crying
for
you
christine
who
have
torn
off
my
mask
and
who
therefore
can
never
leave
me
again
as
long
as
you
thought
me
handsome
you
could
have
come
back
i
know
you
would
have
come
back
but
now
that
you
know
my
hideousness
you
would
run
away
for
good
so
i
shall
keep
you
here
why
did
you
want
to
see
me
oh
mad
christine
who
wanted
to
see
me
when
my
own
father
never
saw
me
and
when
my
mother
so
as
not
to
see
me
made
me
a
present
of
my
first
mask
he
had
let
go
of
me
at
last
and
was
dragging
himself
about
on
the
floor
uttering
terrible
sobs
and
then
he
crawled
away
like
a
snake
went
into
his
room
closed
the
door
and
left
me
alone
to
my
reflections
presently
i
heard
the
sound
of
the
organ
and
then
i
began
to
understand
erik
contemptuous
phrase
when
he
spoke
about
opera
music
what
i
now
heard
was
utterly
different
from
what
i
had
heard
up
to
then
his
don
juan
triumphant
for
i
had
not
a
doubt
but
that
he
had
rushed
to
his
masterpiece
to
forget
the
horror
of
the
moment
seemed
to
me
at
first
one
long
awful
magnificent
sob
but
little
by
little
it
expressed
every
emotion
every
suffering
of
which
mankind
is
capable
it
intoxicated
me
and
i
opened
the
door
that
separated
us
erik
rose
as
i
entered
but
dared
not
turn
in
my
direction
i
cried
me
your
face
without
fear
i
swear
that
you
are
the
most
unhappy
and
sublime
of
men
and
if
ever
again
i
shiver
when
i
look
at
you
it
will
be
because
i
am
thinking
of
the
splendor
of
your
genius
then
erik
turned
round
for
he
believed
me
and
i
also
had
faith
in
myself
he
fell
at
my
feet
with
words
of
love
with
words
of
love
in
his
dead
mouth
and
the
music
had
ceased
he
kissed
the
hem
of
my
dress
and
did
not
see
that
i
closed
my
eyes
what
more
can
i
tell
you
dear
you
now
know
the
tragedy
it
went
on
for
a
fortnight
a
fortnight
during
which
i
lied
to
him
my
lies
were
as
hideous
as
the
monster
who
inspired
them
but
they
were
the
price
of
my
liberty
i
burned
his
mask
and
i
managed
so
well
that
even
when
he
was
not
singing
he
tried
to
catch
my
eye
like
a
dog
sitting
by
its
master
he
was
my
faithful
slave
and
paid
me
endless
little
attentions
gradually
i
gave
him
such
confidence
that
he
ventured
to
take
me
walking
on
the
banks
of
the
lake
and
to
row
me
in
the
boat
on
its
leaden
waters
toward
the
end
of
my
captivity
he
let
me
out
through
the
gates
that
closed
the
underground
passages
in
the
rue
scribe
here
a
carriage
awaited
us
and
took
us
to
the
bois
the
night
when
we
met
you
was
nearly
fatal
to
me
for
he
is
terribly
jealous
of
you
and
i
had
to
tell
him
that
you
were
soon
going
away
then
at
last
after
a
fortnight
of
that
horrible
captivity
during
which
i
was
filled
with
pity
enthusiasm
despair
and
horror
by
turns
he
believed
me
when
i
said
will
come
back
and
you
went
back
christine
groaned
raoul
yes
dear
and
i
must
tell
you
that
it
was
not
his
frightful
threats
when
setting
me
free
that
helped
me
to
keep
my
word
but
the
harrowing
sob
which
he
gave
on
the
threshold
of
the
tomb
that
sob
attached
me
to
the
unfortunate
man
more
than
i
myself
suspected
when
saying
to
him
poor
erik
poor
erik
christine
said
raoul
rising
you
tell
me
that
you
love
me
but
you
had
recovered
your
liberty
hardly
a
few
hours
before
you
returned
to
erik
remember
the
masked
ball
yes
and
do
you
remember
those
hours
which
i
passed
with
you
raoul
to
the
great
danger
of
both
of
us
i
doubted
your
love
for
me
during
those
hours
do
you
doubt
it
still
raoul
then
know
that
each
of
my
visits
to
erik
increased
my
horror
of
him
for
each
of
those
visits
instead
of
calming
him
as
i
hoped
made
him
mad
with
love
and
i
am
so
frightened
so
frightened
you
are
frightened
but
do
you
love
me
if
erik
were
would
you
love
me
christine
she
rose
in
her
turn
put
her
two
trembling
arms
round
the
young
neck
and
said
oh
my
betrothed
of
a
day
if
i
did
not
love
you
i
would
not
give
you
my
lips
take
them
for
the
first
time
and
the
last
he
kissed
her
lips
but
the
night
that
surrounded
them
was
rent
asunder
they
fled
as
at
the
approach
of
a
storm
and
their
eyes
filled
with
dread
of
erik
showed
them
before
they
disappeared
high
up
above
them
an
immense
that
stared
at
them
with
its
blazing
eyes
and
seemed
to
cling
to
the
string
of
apollo
lyre
chapter
xiii
a
of
the
lover
raoul
and
christine
ran
eager
to
escape
from
the
roof
and
the
blazing
eyes
that
showed
only
in
the
dark
and
they
did
not
stop
before
they
came
to
the
eighth
floor
on
the
way
down
there
was
no
performance
at
the
opera
that
night
and
the
passages
were
empty
suddenly
a
form
stood
before
them
and
blocked
the
road
no
not
this
way
and
the
form
pointed
to
another
passage
by
which
they
were
to
reach
the
wings
raoul
wanted
to
stop
and
ask
for
an
explanation
but
the
form
which
wore
a
sort
of
long
and
a
pointed
cap
said
quick
go
away
quickly
christine
was
already
dragging
raoul
compelling
him
to
start
running
again
but
who
is
he
who
is
that
man
he
asked
christine
replied
it
the
persian
what
he
doing
here
nobody
knows
he
is
always
in
the
opera
you
are
making
me
run
away
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
if
we
really
saw
erik
what
i
ought
to
have
done
was
to
nail
him
to
lyre
just
as
we
nail
the
owls
to
the
walls
of
our
breton
farms
and
there
would
have
been
no
more
question
of
him
my
dear
raoul
you
would
first
have
had
to
climb
up
to
apollo
lyre
that
is
no
easy
matter
the
blazing
eyes
were
there
oh
you
are
getting
like
me
now
seeing
him
everywhere
what
i
took
for
blazing
eyes
was
probably
a
couple
of
stars
shining
through
the
strings
of
the
lyre
and
christine
went
down
another
floor
with
raoul
following
her
as
you
have
quite
made
up
your
mind
to
go
christine
i
assure
you
it
would
be
better
to
go
at
once
why
wait
for
he
may
have
heard
us
no
no
he
is
working
i
tell
you
at
his
don
juan
triumphant
and
not
thinking
of
us
you
so
sure
of
that
you
keep
on
looking
behind
you
come
to
my
had
we
better
meet
outside
the
opera
never
till
we
go
away
for
good
it
would
bring
us
bad
luck
if
i
did
not
keep
my
word
i
promised
him
to
see
you
only
here
it
a
good
thing
for
me
that
he
allowed
you
even
that
do
you
know
said
raoul
bitterly
that
it
was
very
plucky
of
you
to
let
us
play
at
being
engaged
why
my
dear
he
knows
all
about
it
he
said
trust
you
christine
de
chagny
is
in
love
with
you
and
is
going
abroad
before
he
goes
i
want
him
to
be
as
happy
as
i
am
are
people
so
unhappy
when
they
love
yes
christine
when
they
love
and
are
not
sure
of
being
loved
they
came
to
christine
why
do
you
think
that
you
are
safer
in
this
room
than
on
the
stage
asked
raoul
you
heard
him
through
the
walls
here
therefore
he
can
certainly
hear
us
no
he
gave
me
his
word
not
to
be
behind
the
walls
of
my
again
and
i
believe
erik
word
this
room
and
my
bedroom
on
the
lake
are
for
me
exclusively
and
not
to
be
approached
by
him
how
can
you
have
gone
from
this
room
into
that
dark
passage
christine
suppose
we
try
to
repeat
your
movements
shall
we
it
is
dangerous
dear
for
the
glass
might
carry
me
off
again
and
instead
of
running
away
i
should
be
obliged
to
go
to
the
end
of
the
secret
passage
to
the
lake
and
there
call
erik
would
he
hear
you
erik
will
hear
me
wherever
i
call
him
he
told
me
so
he
is
a
very
curious
genius
you
must
not
think
raoul
that
he
is
simply
a
man
who
amuses
himself
by
living
underground
he
does
things
that
no
other
man
could
do
he
knows
things
which
nobody
in
the
world
knows
take
care
christine
you
are
making
a
ghost
of
him
again
no
he
is
not
a
ghost
he
is
a
man
of
heaven
and
earth
that
is
all
a
man
of
heaven
and
earth
that
is
all
a
nice
way
to
speak
of
him
and
are
you
still
resolved
to
run
away
from
him
yes
you
will
have
no
resolve
left
then
raoul
you
must
run
away
with
me
in
spite
of
myself
is
that
understood
i
shall
be
here
at
twelve
night
i
shall
keep
my
promise
whatever
happens
you
say
that
after
listening
to
the
performance
he
is
to
wait
for
you
in
the
on
the
lake
yes
and
how
are
you
to
reach
him
if
you
do
know
how
to
go
out
by
the
glass
why
by
going
straight
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
christine
opened
a
box
took
out
an
enormous
key
and
showed
it
to
raoul
what
that
he
asked
the
key
of
the
gate
to
the
underground
passage
in
the
rue
scribe
i
understand
christine
it
leads
straight
to
the
lake
give
it
to
me
christine
will
you
never
she
said
that
would
be
treacherous
suddenly
christine
changed
color
a
mortal
pallor
overspread
her
features
oh
heavens
she
cried
erik
erik
have
pity
on
me
hold
your
tongue
said
raoul
you
told
me
he
could
hear
you
but
the
singer
attitude
became
more
and
more
inexplicable
she
wrung
her
fingers
repeating
with
a
distraught
air
oh
heaven
oh
heaven
but
what
is
it
what
is
it
raoul
implored
the
ring
the
gold
ring
he
gave
me
oh
so
erik
gave
you
that
ring
you
know
he
did
raoul
but
what
you
do
know
is
that
when
he
gave
it
to
me
he
said
give
you
back
your
liberty
christine
on
condition
that
this
ring
is
always
on
your
finger
as
long
as
you
keep
it
you
will
be
protected
against
all
danger
and
erik
will
remain
your
friend
but
woe
to
you
if
you
ever
part
with
it
for
erik
will
have
his
revenge
my
dear
my
dear
the
ring
is
gone
woe
to
us
both
they
both
looked
for
the
ring
but
could
not
find
it
christine
refused
to
be
pacified
it
was
while
i
gave
you
that
kiss
up
above
under
apollo
lyre
she
said
the
ring
must
have
slipped
from
my
finger
and
dropped
into
the
street
we
can
never
find
it
and
what
misfortunes
are
in
store
for
us
now
oh
to
run
away
let
us
run
away
at
once
raoul
insisted
once
more
she
hesitated
he
thought
that
she
was
going
to
say
yes
then
her
bright
pupils
became
dimmed
and
she
said
no
and
she
left
him
hurriedly
still
wringing
and
rubbing
her
fingers
as
though
she
hoped
to
bring
the
ring
back
like
that
raoul
went
home
greatly
perturbed
at
all
that
he
had
heard
illustration
they
sat
like
that
for
a
moment
in
silence
if
i
do
save
her
from
the
hands
of
that
humbug
he
said
aloud
as
he
went
to
bed
she
is
lost
but
i
shall
save
her
he
put
out
his
lamp
and
felt
a
need
to
insult
erik
in
the
dark
thrice
over
he
shouted
humbug
humbug
humbug
but
suddenly
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
a
cold
sweat
poured
from
his
temples
two
eyes
like
blazing
coals
had
appeared
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
they
stared
at
him
fixedly
terribly
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
raoul
was
no
coward
and
yet
he
trembled
he
put
out
a
groping
hesitating
hand
toward
the
table
by
his
bedside
he
found
the
matches
and
lit
his
candle
the
eyes
disappeared
still
uneasy
in
his
mind
he
thought
to
himself
she
told
me
that
his
eyes
only
showed
in
the
dark
his
eyes
have
disappeared
in
the
light
but
he
may
be
there
still
and
he
rose
hunted
about
went
round
the
room
he
looked
under
his
bed
like
a
child
then
he
thought
himself
absurd
got
into
bed
again
and
blew
out
the
candle
the
eyes
reappeared
he
sat
up
and
stared
back
at
them
with
all
the
courage
he
possessed
then
he
cried
is
that
you
erik
man
genius
or
ghost
is
it
you
he
reflected
if
it
he
he
on
the
balcony
then
he
ran
to
the
chest
of
drawers
and
groped
for
his
revolver
he
opened
the
balcony
window
looked
out
saw
nothing
and
closed
the
window
again
he
went
back
to
bed
shivering
for
the
night
was
cold
and
put
the
revolver
on
the
table
within
his
reach
the
eyes
were
still
there
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
were
they
between
the
bed
and
the
or
behind
the
pane
that
is
to
say
on
the
balcony
that
was
what
raoul
wanted
to
know
he
also
wanted
to
know
if
those
eyes
belonged
to
a
human
being
he
wanted
to
know
everything
then
patiently
calmly
he
seized
his
revolver
and
took
aim
he
aimed
a
little
above
the
two
eyes
surely
if
they
were
eyes
and
if
above
those
two
eyes
there
was
a
forehead
and
if
raoul
was
not
too
clumsy
the
shot
made
a
terrible
din
amid
the
silence
of
the
slumbering
house
and
while
footsteps
came
hurrying
along
the
passages
raoul
sat
up
with
outstretched
arm
ready
to
fire
again
if
need
be
this
time
the
two
eyes
had
disappeared
servants
appeared
carrying
lights
count
philippe
terribly
anxious
what
is
it
i
think
i
have
been
dreaming
replied
the
young
man
i
fired
at
two
stars
that
kept
me
from
sleeping
you
raving
are
you
ill
for
god
sake
tell
me
raoul
what
happened
and
the
count
seized
hold
of
the
revolver
no
no
i
not
raving
besides
we
shall
soon
see
he
got
out
of
bed
put
on
a
and
slippers
took
a
light
from
the
hands
of
a
servant
and
opening
the
window
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
the
count
saw
that
the
window
had
been
pierced
by
a
bullet
at
a
height
raoul
was
leaning
over
the
balcony
with
his
candle
aha
he
said
blood
blood
here
there
more
blood
that
a
good
thing
a
ghost
who
bleeds
is
less
dangerous
he
grinned
raoul
raoul
raoul
the
count
was
shaking
him
as
though
he
were
trying
to
waken
a
but
my
dear
brother
i
not
asleep
raoul
protested
impatiently
you
can
see
the
blood
for
yourself
i
thought
i
had
been
dreaming
and
firing
at
two
stars
it
was
erik
eyes
and
here
is
his
blood
after
all
perhaps
i
was
wrong
to
shoot
and
christine
is
quite
capable
of
never
forgiving
me
all
this
would
not
have
happened
if
i
had
drawn
the
curtains
before
going
to
bed
raoul
have
you
suddenly
gone
mad
wake
up
what
still
you
would
do
better
to
help
me
find
erik
for
after
all
a
ghost
who
bleeds
can
always
be
found
the
count
valet
said
that
is
so
sir
there
is
blood
on
the
balcony
the
other
brought
a
lamp
by
the
light
of
which
they
examined
the
balcony
carefully
the
marks
of
blood
followed
the
rail
till
they
reached
a
then
they
went
up
the
my
dear
fellow
said
count
philippe
you
have
fired
at
a
cat
the
misfortune
is
said
raoul
with
a
grin
that
it
quite
possible
with
erik
you
never
know
is
it
erik
is
it
the
cat
is
it
the
ghost
no
with
erik
you
ca
tell
raoul
went
on
making
this
strange
sort
of
remarks
which
corresponded
so
intimately
and
logically
with
the
preoccupation
of
his
brain
and
which
at
the
same
time
tended
to
persuade
many
people
that
his
mind
was
unhinged
the
count
himself
was
seized
with
this
idea
and
later
the
examining
magistrate
on
receiving
the
report
of
the
commissary
of
police
came
to
the
same
conclusion
who
is
erik
asked
the
count
pressing
his
brother
hand
he
is
my
rival
and
if
he
not
dead
it
a
pity
he
dismissed
the
servants
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
the
two
chagnys
were
left
alone
but
the
men
were
not
out
of
earshot
before
the
count
valet
heard
raoul
say
distinctly
and
emphatically
i
shall
carry
off
christine
daae
this
phrase
was
afterward
repeated
to
faure
the
but
no
one
ever
knew
exactly
what
passed
between
the
two
brothers
at
this
interview
the
servants
declared
that
this
was
not
their
first
quarrel
their
voices
penetrated
the
wall
and
it
was
always
an
actress
called
christine
daae
that
was
in
question
at
breakfast
the
early
morning
breakfast
which
the
count
took
in
his
study
philippe
sent
for
his
brother
raoul
arrived
silent
and
gloomy
the
scene
was
a
very
short
one
philippe
handed
his
brother
a
copy
of
the
epoque
and
said
read
that
the
viscount
read
the
latest
news
in
the
faubourg
is
that
there
is
a
promise
of
marriage
between
mlle
christine
daae
the
and
le
vicomte
raoul
de
chagny
if
the
gossips
are
to
be
credited
count
philippe
has
sworn
that
for
the
first
time
on
record
the
chagnys
shall
not
keep
their
promise
but
as
love
is
at
the
opera
as
and
even
more
than
elsewhere
we
wonder
how
count
philippe
intends
to
prevent
the
viscount
his
brother
from
leading
the
new
margarita
to
the
altar
the
two
brothers
are
said
to
adore
each
other
but
the
count
is
curiously
mistaken
if
he
imagines
that
brotherly
love
will
triumph
over
love
pure
and
simple
you
see
raoul
said
the
count
you
are
making
us
ridiculous
that
little
girl
has
turned
your
head
with
her
the
viscount
had
evidently
repeated
christine
narrative
to
his
brother
during
the
night
all
that
he
now
said
was
philippe
have
you
quite
made
up
your
mind
you
are
going
with
her
no
reply
surely
you
will
not
do
anything
so
foolish
i
shall
know
how
to
prevent
you
philippe
said
the
viscount
again
and
left
the
room
this
scene
was
described
to
the
by
the
count
himself
who
did
not
see
raoul
again
until
that
evening
at
the
opera
a
few
minutes
before
christine
disappearance
raoul
in
fact
devoted
the
whole
day
to
his
preparations
for
the
flight
the
horses
the
carriage
the
coachman
the
provisions
the
luggage
the
money
required
for
the
journey
the
road
to
be
taken
he
had
resolved
not
to
go
by
train
so
as
to
throw
the
ghost
off
the
scent
all
this
had
to
be
settled
and
provided
for
and
it
occupied
him
until
nine
at
night
at
nine
a
sort
of
with
the
curtains
of
its
windows
took
its
place
in
the
rank
on
the
rotunda
side
it
was
drawn
by
two
powerful
horses
driven
by
a
coachman
whose
face
was
almost
concealed
in
the
long
folds
of
a
muffler
in
front
of
this
were
three
broughams
belonging
respectively
to
carlotta
who
had
suddenly
returned
to
paris
to
sorelli
and
at
the
head
of
the
rank
to
comte
philippe
de
chagny
no
one
left
the
barouche
the
coachman
remained
on
his
box
and
the
three
other
coachmen
remained
on
theirs
a
shadow
in
a
long
black
cloak
and
a
soft
black
felt
hat
passed
along
the
pavement
between
the
rotunda
and
the
carriages
examined
the
barouche
carefully
went
up
to
the
horses
and
the
coachman
and
then
moved
away
without
saying
a
word
the
magistrate
afterward
believed
that
this
shadow
was
that
of
the
vicomte
raoul
de
chagny
but
i
do
not
agree
seeing
that
that
evening
as
every
evening
the
vicomte
de
chagny
was
wearing
a
tall
hat
which
hat
besides
was
subsequently
found
i
am
more
inclined
to
think
that
the
shadow
was
that
of
the
ghost
who
knew
all
about
the
whole
affair
as
the
reader
will
soon
perceive
they
were
giving
faust
as
it
happened
before
a
splendid
house
the
faubourg
was
magnificently
represented
and
the
paragraph
in
that
morning
epoque
had
already
produced
its
effect
for
all
eyes
were
turned
to
the
box
in
which
count
philippe
sat
alone
apparently
in
a
very
indifferent
and
careless
frame
of
mind
the
feminine
element
in
the
brilliant
audience
seemed
curiously
puzzled
and
the
absence
gave
rise
to
any
amount
of
whispering
behind
the
fans
christine
daae
met
with
a
rather
cold
reception
that
special
audience
could
not
forgive
her
for
aiming
so
high
the
singer
noticed
this
unfavorable
attitude
of
a
portion
of
the
house
and
was
confused
by
it
the
regular
frequenters
of
the
opera
who
pretended
to
know
the
truth
about
the
viscount
exchanged
significant
smiles
at
certain
passages
in
margarita
part
and
they
made
a
show
of
turning
and
looking
at
philippe
de
chagny
box
when
christine
sang
i
wish
i
could
but
know
who
was
he
that
addressed
me
if
he
was
noble
or
at
least
what
his
name
is
the
count
sat
with
his
chin
on
his
hand
and
seemed
to
pay
no
attention
to
these
manifestations
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
stage
but
his
thoughts
appeared
to
be
far
away
christine
lost
her
more
and
more
she
trembled
she
felt
on
the
verge
of
a
breakdown
carolus
fonta
wondered
if
she
was
ill
if
she
could
keep
the
stage
until
the
end
of
the
garden
act
in
the
front
of
the
house
people
remembered
the
catastrophe
that
had
befallen
carlotta
at
the
end
of
that
act
and
the
historic
which
had
momentarily
interrupted
her
career
in
paris
just
then
carlotta
made
her
entrance
in
a
box
facing
the
stage
a
sensational
entrance
poor
christine
raised
her
eyes
upon
this
fresh
subject
of
excitement
she
recognized
her
rival
she
thought
she
saw
a
sneer
on
her
lips
that
saved
her
she
forgot
everything
in
order
to
triumph
once
more
from
that
moment
the
prima
donna
sang
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
she
tried
to
surpass
all
that
she
had
done
till
then
and
she
succeeded
in
the
last
act
when
she
began
the
invocation
to
the
angels
she
made
all
the
members
of
the
audience
feel
as
though
they
too
had
wings
in
the
center
of
the
amphitheater
a
man
stood
up
and
remained
standing
facing
the
singer
it
was
raoul
holy
angel
in
heaven
blessed
and
christine
her
arms
outstretched
her
throat
filled
with
music
the
glory
of
her
hair
falling
over
her
bare
shoulders
uttered
the
divine
cry
my
spirit
longs
with
thee
to
rest
it
was
at
that
moment
that
the
stage
was
suddenly
plunged
in
darkness
it
happened
so
quickly
that
the
spectators
hardly
had
time
to
utter
a
sound
of
stupefaction
for
the
gas
at
once
lit
up
the
stage
again
but
christine
daae
was
no
longer
there
what
had
become
of
her
what
was
that
miracle
all
exchanged
glances
without
understanding
and
the
excitement
at
once
reached
its
height
nor
was
the
tension
any
less
great
on
the
stage
itself
men
rushed
from
the
wings
to
the
spot
where
christine
had
been
singing
that
very
instant
the
performance
was
interrupted
amid
the
greatest
disorder
where
had
christine
gone
what
witchcraft
had
snatched
her
away
before
the
eyes
of
thousands
of
enthusiastic
onlookers
and
from
the
arms
of
carolus
fonta
himself
it
was
as
though
the
angels
had
really
carried
her
up
to
rest
raoul
still
standing
up
in
the
amphitheater
had
uttered
a
cry
count
philippe
had
sprung
to
his
feet
in
his
box
people
looked
at
the
stage
at
the
count
at
raoul
and
wondered
if
this
curious
event
was
connected
in
any
way
with
the
paragraph
in
that
morning
paper
but
raoul
hurriedly
left
his
seat
the
count
disappeared
from
his
box
and
while
the
curtain
was
lowered
the
subscribers
rushed
to
the
door
that
led
behind
the
scenes
the
rest
of
the
audience
waited
amid
an
indescribable
hubbub
every
one
spoke
at
once
every
one
tried
to
suggest
an
explanation
of
the
extraordinary
incident
at
last
the
curtain
rose
slowly
and
carolus
fonta
stepped
to
the
conductor
desk
and
in
a
sad
and
serious
voice
said
ladies
and
gentlemen
an
unprecedented
event
has
taken
place
and
thrown
us
into
a
state
of
the
greatest
alarm
our
christine
daae
has
disappeared
before
our
eyes
and
nobody
can
tell
us
how
chapter
xiv
the
singular
attitude
of
a
behind
the
curtain
there
was
an
indescribable
crowd
artists
dancers
supers
choristers
subscribers
were
all
asking
questions
shouting
and
hustling
one
another
what
became
of
her
she
run
away
with
the
vicomte
de
chagny
of
course
no
with
the
count
ah
here
carlotta
carlotta
did
the
trick
no
it
was
the
ghost
and
a
few
laughed
especially
as
a
careful
examination
of
the
and
boards
had
put
the
idea
of
an
accident
out
of
the
question
amid
this
noisy
throng
three
men
stood
talking
in
a
low
voice
and
with
despairing
gestures
they
were
gabriel
the
mercier
the
and
remy
the
secretary
they
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
lobby
by
which
the
stage
communicates
with
the
wide
passage
leading
to
the
foyer
of
the
ballet
here
they
stood
and
argued
behind
some
enormous
properties
i
knocked
at
the
door
said
remy
they
did
not
answer
perhaps
they
are
not
in
the
office
in
any
case
it
impossible
to
find
out
for
they
took
the
keys
with
them
they
were
obviously
the
managers
who
had
given
orders
during
the
last
that
they
were
not
to
be
disturbed
on
any
pretext
whatever
they
were
not
in
to
anybody
all
the
same
exclaimed
gabriel
a
singer
is
run
away
with
from
the
middle
of
the
stage
every
day
did
you
shout
that
to
them
asked
mercier
impatiently
i
go
back
again
said
remy
and
disappeared
at
a
run
thereupon
the
arrived
well
mercier
are
you
coming
what
are
you
two
doing
here
you
wanted
mr
i
refuse
to
know
or
to
do
anything
before
the
commissary
arrives
declared
mercier
i
have
sent
for
mifroid
we
shall
see
when
he
comes
and
i
tell
you
that
you
ought
to
go
down
to
the
organ
at
once
not
before
the
commissary
comes
i
been
down
to
the
organ
myself
already
ah
and
what
did
you
see
well
i
saw
nobody
do
you
hear
nobody
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
down
there
for
sic
you
right
said
the
frantically
pushing
his
hands
through
his
rebellious
hair
you
right
but
there
might
be
some
one
at
the
organ
who
could
tell
us
how
the
stage
came
to
be
suddenly
darkened
now
mauclair
is
nowhere
to
be
found
do
you
understand
that
mauclair
was
the
who
dispensed
day
and
night
at
will
on
the
stage
of
the
opera
mauclair
is
not
to
be
found
repeated
mercier
taken
aback
well
what
about
his
assistants
there
no
mauclair
and
no
assistants
no
one
at
the
lights
i
tell
you
you
can
imagine
roared
the
that
that
little
girl
must
have
been
carried
off
by
somebody
else
she
did
run
away
by
herself
it
was
a
calculated
stroke
and
we
have
to
find
out
about
it
and
what
are
the
managers
doing
all
this
time
i
gave
orders
that
no
one
was
to
go
down
to
the
lights
and
i
posted
a
fireman
in
front
of
the
box
beside
the
organ
was
that
right
yes
yes
quite
right
quite
right
and
now
let
wait
for
the
commissary
the
walked
away
shrugging
his
shoulders
fuming
muttering
insults
at
those
milksops
who
remained
quietly
squatting
in
a
corner
while
the
whole
theater
was
topsyturvy
sic
gabriel
and
mercier
were
not
so
quiet
as
all
that
only
they
had
received
an
order
that
paralyzed
them
the
managers
were
not
to
be
disturbed
on
any
account
remy
had
violated
that
order
and
met
with
no
success
at
that
moment
he
returned
from
his
new
expedition
wearing
a
curiously
startled
air
well
have
you
seen
them
asked
mercier
moncharmin
opened
the
door
at
last
his
eyes
were
starting
out
of
his
head
i
thought
he
meant
to
strike
me
i
could
not
get
a
word
in
and
what
do
you
think
he
shouted
at
me
you
a
then
clear
out
i
tried
to
tell
him
that
an
thing
had
happened
on
the
stage
but
he
roared
give
me
a
at
once
a
boy
heard
him
he
was
bellowing
like
a
bull
ran
up
with
a
and
gave
it
to
him
whereupon
moncharmin
slammed
the
door
in
my
face
and
there
you
are
and
could
you
have
said
daae
i
should
like
to
have
seen
you
in
my
place
he
was
foaming
at
the
mouth
he
thought
of
nothing
but
his
i
believe
if
they
had
brought
him
one
on
the
spot
he
would
have
fallen
down
in
a
fit
oh
all
this
is
natural
and
our
managers
are
going
mad
besides
it
ca
go
on
like
this
i
not
used
to
being
treated
in
that
fashion
suddenly
gabriel
whispered
it
another
trick
of
o
rimy
gave
a
grin
mercier
a
sigh
and
seemed
about
to
speak
but
meeting
gabriel
eye
said
nothing
however
mercier
felt
his
responsibility
increased
as
the
minutes
passed
without
the
managers
appearing
and
at
last
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
look
here
i
go
and
hunt
them
out
myself
gabriel
turning
very
gloomy
and
serious
stopped
him
be
careful
what
you
doing
mercier
if
they
staying
in
their
office
it
probably
because
they
have
to
has
more
than
one
trick
in
his
bag
but
mercier
shook
his
head
that
their
lookout
i
going
if
people
had
listened
to
me
the
police
would
have
known
everything
long
ago
and
he
went
what
everything
asked
remy
what
was
there
to
tell
the
police
why
do
you
answer
gabriel
ah
so
you
know
something
well
you
would
do
better
to
tell
me
too
if
you
do
want
me
to
shout
out
that
you
are
all
going
mad
yes
that
what
you
are
mad
gabriel
put
on
a
stupid
look
and
pretended
not
to
understand
the
private
secretary
unseemly
outburst
what
am
i
supposed
to
know
he
said
i
do
know
what
you
mean
remy
began
to
lose
his
temper
this
evening
richard
and
moncharmin
were
behaving
like
lunatics
here
between
the
acts
i
never
noticed
it
growled
gabriel
very
much
annoyed
then
you
the
only
one
do
you
think
that
i
did
see
them
and
that
parabise
the
manager
of
the
credit
central
noticed
nothing
and
that
de
la
borderie
the
ambassador
has
no
eyes
to
see
with
why
all
the
subscribers
were
pointing
at
our
managers
but
what
were
our
managers
doing
asked
gabriel
putting
on
his
most
innocent
air
what
were
they
doing
you
know
better
than
any
one
what
they
were
doing
you
were
there
and
you
were
watching
them
you
and
mercier
and
you
were
the
only
two
who
did
laugh
i
do
understand
gabriel
raised
his
arms
and
dropped
them
to
his
sides
again
which
gesture
was
meant
to
convey
that
the
question
did
not
interest
him
in
the
least
remy
continued
what
is
the
sense
of
this
new
mania
of
theirs
why
wo
they
have
any
one
come
near
them
now
what
wo
they
have
any
one
come
near
them
and
they
wo
let
any
one
touch
them
really
have
you
noticed
that
they
wo
let
any
one
touch
them
that
is
certainly
odd
oh
so
you
admit
it
and
high
time
too
and
then
they
walk
backward
backward
you
have
seen
our
managers
walk
backward
why
i
thought
that
only
crabs
walked
backward
do
laugh
gabriel
do
laugh
i
not
laughing
protested
gabriel
looking
as
solemn
as
a
judge
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
this
gabriel
as
you
an
intimate
friend
of
the
management
when
i
went
up
to
richard
outside
the
foyer
during
the
garden
interval
with
my
hand
out
before
me
why
did
moncharmin
hurriedly
whisper
to
me
away
go
away
whatever
you
do
do
touch
le
directeur
am
i
supposed
to
have
an
infectious
disease
it
incredible
and
a
little
later
when
de
la
borderie
went
up
to
richard
did
you
see
moncharmin
fling
himself
between
them
and
hear
him
exclaim
i
entreat
you
not
to
touch
le
directeur
it
terrible
and
what
was
richard
doing
meanwhile
what
was
he
doing
why
you
saw
him
he
turned
about
bowed
in
front
of
him
though
there
was
nobody
in
front
of
him
and
withdrew
backward
backward
and
moncharmin
behind
richard
also
turned
about
that
is
he
described
a
semicircle
behind
richard
and
also
walked
backward
and
they
went
like
that
to
the
staircase
leading
to
the
managers
office
backward
backward
backward
well
if
they
are
not
mad
will
you
explain
what
it
means
perhaps
they
were
practising
a
figure
in
the
ballet
suggested
gabriel
without
much
conviction
in
his
voice
the
secretary
was
furious
at
this
wretched
joke
made
at
so
dramatic
a
moment
he
knit
his
brows
and
contracted
his
lips
then
he
put
his
mouth
to
gabriel
ear
do
be
so
sly
gabriel
there
are
things
going
on
for
which
you
and
mercier
are
partly
responsible
what
do
you
mean
asked
gabriel
christine
daae
is
not
the
only
one
who
suddenly
disappeared
oh
nonsense
there
no
nonsense
about
it
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
why
when
mother
giry
came
down
to
the
foyer
just
now
mercier
took
her
by
the
hand
and
hurried
her
away
with
him
really
said
gabriel
i
never
saw
it
you
did
see
it
gabriel
for
you
went
with
mercier
and
mother
giry
to
mercier
office
since
then
you
and
mercier
have
been
seen
but
no
one
has
seen
mother
giry
do
you
think
we
eaten
her
no
but
you
locked
her
up
in
the
office
and
any
one
passing
the
office
can
hear
her
yelling
the
scoundrels
oh
the
scoundrels
at
this
point
of
this
singular
conversation
mercier
arrived
all
out
of
breath
there
he
said
in
a
gloomy
voice
it
worse
than
ever
i
shouted
a
serious
matter
open
the
door
it
i
mercier
i
heard
footsteps
the
door
opened
and
moncharmin
appeared
he
was
very
pale
he
said
do
you
want
i
answered
one
has
run
away
with
christine
daae
what
do
you
think
he
said
a
good
job
too
and
he
shut
the
door
after
putting
this
in
my
hand
mercier
opened
his
hand
remy
and
gabriel
looked
the
cried
remy
strange
strange
muttered
gabriel
who
could
not
help
shivering
suddenly
a
voice
made
them
all
three
turn
round
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
could
you
tell
me
where
christine
daae
is
in
spite
of
the
seriousness
of
the
circumstances
the
absurdity
of
the
question
would
have
made
them
roar
with
laughter
if
they
had
not
caught
sight
of
a
face
so
that
they
were
at
once
seized
with
pity
it
was
the
vicomte
raoul
de
chagny
chapter
xv
christine
christine
raoul
first
thought
after
christine
daae
fantastic
disappearance
was
to
accuse
erik
he
no
longer
doubted
the
almost
supernatural
powers
of
the
angel
of
music
in
this
domain
of
the
opera
in
which
he
had
set
up
his
empire
and
raoul
rushed
on
the
stage
in
a
mad
fit
of
love
and
despair
christine
christine
he
moaned
calling
to
her
as
he
felt
that
she
must
be
calling
to
him
from
the
depths
of
that
dark
pit
to
which
the
monster
had
carried
her
christine
christine
and
he
seemed
to
hear
the
girl
screams
through
the
frail
boards
that
separated
him
from
her
he
bent
forward
he
listened
he
wandered
over
the
stage
like
a
madman
ah
to
descend
to
descend
into
that
pit
of
darkness
every
entrance
to
which
was
closed
to
him
for
the
stairs
that
led
below
the
stage
were
forbidden
to
one
and
all
that
night
christine
christine
people
pushed
him
aside
laughing
they
made
fun
of
him
they
thought
the
poor
lover
brain
was
gone
by
what
mad
road
through
what
passages
of
mystery
and
darkness
known
to
him
alone
had
erik
dragged
that
child
to
the
awful
haunt
with
the
room
opening
out
on
the
lake
christine
christine
why
do
you
answer
are
you
alive
hideous
thoughts
flashed
through
raoul
congested
brain
of
course
erik
must
have
discovered
their
secret
must
have
known
that
christine
had
played
him
false
what
a
vengeance
would
be
his
and
raoul
thought
again
of
the
yellow
stars
that
had
come
the
night
before
and
roamed
over
his
balcony
why
had
he
not
put
them
out
for
good
there
were
some
men
eyes
that
dilated
in
the
darkness
and
shone
like
stars
or
like
cats
eyes
certainly
albinos
who
seemed
to
have
rabbits
eyes
by
day
had
cats
eyes
at
night
everybody
knew
that
yes
yes
he
had
undoubtedly
fired
at
erik
why
had
he
not
killed
him
the
monster
had
fled
up
the
like
a
cat
or
a
convict
who
everybody
knew
that
also
would
scale
the
very
skies
with
the
help
of
a
no
doubt
erik
was
at
that
time
contemplating
some
decisive
step
against
raoul
but
he
had
been
wounded
and
had
escaped
to
turn
against
poor
christine
instead
such
were
the
cruel
thoughts
that
haunted
raoul
as
he
ran
to
the
singer
christine
christine
bitter
tears
scorched
the
boy
eyelids
as
he
saw
scattered
over
the
furniture
the
clothes
which
his
beautiful
bride
was
to
have
worn
at
the
hour
of
their
flight
oh
why
had
she
refused
to
leave
earlier
why
had
she
toyed
with
the
threatening
catastrophe
why
toyed
with
the
monster
heart
why
in
a
final
access
of
pity
had
she
insisted
on
flinging
as
a
last
sop
to
that
demon
soul
her
divine
song
holy
angel
in
heaven
blessed
my
spirit
longs
with
thee
to
rest
raoul
his
throat
filled
with
sobs
oaths
and
insults
fumbled
awkwardly
at
the
great
mirror
that
had
opened
one
night
before
his
eyes
to
let
christine
pass
to
the
murky
dwelling
below
he
pushed
pressed
groped
about
but
the
glass
apparently
obeyed
no
one
but
erik
perhaps
actions
were
not
enough
with
a
glass
of
the
kind
perhaps
he
was
expected
to
utter
certain
words
when
he
was
a
little
boy
he
had
heard
that
there
were
things
that
obeyed
the
spoken
word
suddenly
raoul
remembered
something
about
a
gate
opening
into
the
rue
scribe
an
underground
passage
running
straight
to
the
rue
scribe
from
the
lake
yes
christine
had
told
him
about
that
and
when
he
found
that
the
key
was
no
longer
in
the
box
he
nevertheless
ran
to
the
rue
scribe
outside
in
the
street
he
passed
his
trembling
hands
over
the
huge
stones
felt
for
outlets
met
with
iron
bars
were
those
they
or
these
or
could
it
be
that
he
plunged
his
useless
eyes
through
the
bars
how
dark
it
was
in
there
he
listened
all
was
silence
he
went
round
the
building
and
came
to
bigger
bars
immense
gates
it
was
the
entrance
to
the
cour
de
raoul
rushed
into
the
doorkeeper
lodge
i
beg
your
pardon
madame
could
you
tell
me
where
to
find
a
gate
or
door
made
of
bars
iron
bars
opening
into
the
rue
scribe
and
leading
to
the
lake
you
know
the
lake
i
mean
yes
the
underground
lake
under
the
opera
yes
sir
i
know
there
is
a
lake
under
the
opera
but
i
do
know
which
door
leads
to
it
i
have
never
been
there
and
the
rue
scribe
madame
the
rue
scribe
have
you
never
been
to
the
rue
scribe
the
woman
laughed
screamed
with
laughter
raoul
darted
away
roaring
with
anger
ran
four
stairs
at
a
time
rushed
through
the
whole
of
the
business
side
of
the
found
himself
once
more
in
the
light
of
the
stage
he
stopped
with
his
heart
thumping
in
his
chest
suppose
christine
daae
had
been
found
he
saw
a
group
of
men
and
asked
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
could
you
tell
me
where
christine
daae
is
and
somebody
laughed
at
the
same
moment
the
stage
buzzed
with
a
new
sound
and
amid
a
crowd
of
men
in
all
talking
and
gesticulating
together
appeared
a
man
who
seemed
very
calm
and
displayed
a
pleasant
face
all
pink
and
crowned
with
curly
hair
and
lit
up
by
a
pair
of
wonderfully
serene
blue
eyes
mercier
the
called
the
vicomte
de
chagny
attention
to
him
and
said
this
is
the
gentleman
to
whom
you
should
put
your
question
monsieur
let
me
introduce
mifroid
the
commissary
of
police
ah
le
vicomte
de
chagny
delighted
to
meet
you
monsieur
said
the
commissary
would
you
mind
coming
with
me
and
now
where
are
the
managers
where
are
the
managers
mercier
did
not
answer
and
remy
the
secretary
volunteered
the
information
that
the
managers
were
locked
up
in
their
office
and
that
they
knew
nothing
as
yet
of
what
had
happened
you
do
mean
to
say
so
let
us
go
up
to
the
office
and
mifroid
followed
by
an
crowd
turned
toward
the
business
side
of
the
building
mercier
took
advantage
of
the
confusion
to
slip
a
key
into
gabriel
hand
this
is
all
going
very
badly
he
whispered
you
had
better
let
mother
giry
out
and
gabriel
moved
away
they
soon
came
to
the
managers
door
mercier
stormed
in
vain
the
door
remained
closed
open
in
the
name
of
the
law
commanded
mifroid
in
a
loud
and
rather
anxious
voice
at
last
the
door
was
opened
all
rushed
in
to
the
office
on
the
commissary
heels
raoul
was
the
last
to
enter
as
he
was
about
to
follow
the
rest
into
the
room
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
he
heard
these
words
spoken
in
his
ear
erik
secrets
concern
no
one
but
himself
he
turned
around
with
a
stifled
exclamation
the
hand
that
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
was
now
placed
on
the
lips
of
a
person
with
an
ebony
skin
with
eyes
of
jade
and
with
an
astrakhan
cap
on
his
head
the
persian
the
stranger
kept
up
the
gesture
that
recommended
discretion
and
then
at
the
moment
when
the
astonished
viscount
was
about
to
ask
the
reason
of
his
mysterious
intervention
bowed
and
disappeared
chapter

mme
giry
astounding
revelations
as
to
her
personal
relations
with
the
opera
ghost
before
following
the
commissary
into
the
manager
office
i
must
describe
certain
extraordinary
occurrences
that
took
place
in
that
office
which
remy
and
mercier
had
vainly
tried
to
enter
and
into
which
mm
richard
and
moncharmin
had
locked
themselves
with
an
object
which
the
reader
does
not
yet
know
but
which
it
is
my
duty
as
an
historian
to
reveal
without
further
postponement
i
have
had
occasion
to
say
that
the
managers
mood
had
undergone
a
disagreeable
change
for
some
time
past
and
to
convey
the
fact
that
this
change
was
due
not
only
to
the
fall
of
the
chandelier
on
the
famous
night
of
the
gala
performance
the
reader
must
know
that
the
ghost
had
calmly
been
paid
his
first
twenty
thousand
francs
oh
there
had
been
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
indeed
and
yet
the
thing
had
happened
as
simply
as
could
be
one
morning
the
managers
found
on
their
table
an
envelope
addressed
to
monsieur
private
and
accompanied
by
a
note
from
himself
the
time
has
come
to
carry
out
the
clause
in
the
please
put
twenty
notes
of
a
thousand
francs
each
into
this
envelope
seal
it
with
your
own
seal
and
hand
it
to
mme
giry
who
will
do
what
is
necessary
the
managers
did
not
hesitate
without
wasting
time
in
asking
how
these
confounded
communications
came
to
be
delivered
in
an
office
which
they
were
careful
to
keep
locked
they
seized
this
opportunity
of
laying
hands
on
the
mysterious
blackmailer
and
after
telling
the
whole
story
under
the
promise
of
secrecy
to
gabriel
and
mercier
they
put
the
twenty
thousand
francs
into
the
envelope
and
without
asking
for
explanations
handed
it
to
mme
giry
who
had
been
reinstated
in
her
functions
the
displayed
no
astonishment
i
need
hardly
say
that
she
was
well
watched
she
went
straight
to
the
ghost
box
and
placed
the
precious
envelope
on
the
little
shelf
attached
to
the
ledge
the
two
managers
as
well
as
gabriel
and
mercier
were
hidden
in
such
a
way
that
they
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
envelope
for
a
second
during
the
performance
and
even
afterward
for
as
the
envelope
had
not
moved
those
who
watched
it
did
not
move
either
and
mme
giry
went
away
while
the
managers
gabriel
and
mercier
were
still
there
at
last
they
became
tired
of
waiting
and
opened
the
envelope
after
ascertaining
that
the
seals
had
not
been
broken
at
first
sight
richard
and
moncharmin
thought
that
the
notes
were
still
there
but
soon
they
perceived
that
they
were
not
the
same
the
twenty
real
notes
were
gone
and
had
been
replaced
by
twenty
notes
of
the
bank
of
st
farce
the
managers
rage
and
fright
were
unmistakable
moncharmin
wanted
to
send
for
the
commissary
of
police
but
richard
objected
he
no
doubt
had
a
plan
for
he
said
do
let
us
make
ourselves
ridiculous
all
paris
would
laugh
at
us
has
won
the
first
game
we
will
win
the
second
he
was
thinking
of
the
next
month
allowance
nevertheless
they
had
been
so
absolutely
tricked
that
they
were
bound
to
suffer
a
certain
dejection
and
upon
my
word
it
was
not
difficult
to
understand
we
must
not
forget
that
the
managers
had
an
idea
at
the
back
of
their
minds
all
the
time
that
this
strange
incident
might
be
an
unpleasant
practical
joke
on
the
part
of
their
predecessors
and
that
it
would
not
do
to
divulge
it
prematurely
on
the
other
hand
moncharmin
was
sometimes
troubled
with
a
suspicion
of
richard
himself
who
occasionally
took
fanciful
whims
into
his
head
and
so
they
were
content
to
await
events
while
keeping
an
eye
on
mother
giry
richard
would
not
have
her
spoken
to
if
she
is
a
confederate
he
said
the
notes
are
gone
long
ago
but
in
my
opinion
she
is
merely
an
idiot
she
not
the
only
idiot
in
this
business
said
moncharmin
pensively
well
who
could
have
thought
it
moaned
richard
but
do
be
afraid
next
time
i
shall
have
taken
my
precautions
the
next
time
fell
on
the
same
day
that
beheld
the
disappearance
of
christine
daae
in
the
morning
a
note
from
the
ghost
reminded
them
that
the
money
was
due
it
read
do
just
as
you
did
last
time
it
went
very
well
put
the
twenty
thousand
in
the
envelope
and
hand
it
to
our
excellent
mme
giry
and
the
note
was
accompanied
by
the
usual
envelope
they
had
only
to
insert
the
notes
this
was
done
about
half
an
hour
before
the
curtain
rose
on
the
first
act
of
faust
richard
showed
the
envelope
to
moncharmin
then
he
counted
the
twenty
notes
in
front
of
him
and
put
the
notes
into
the
envelope
but
without
closing
it
and
now
he
said
let
have
mother
giry
in
the
old
woman
was
sent
for
she
entered
with
a
sweeping
courtesy
she
still
wore
her
black
taffeta
dress
the
color
of
which
was
rapidly
turning
to
rust
and
lilac
to
say
nothing
of
the
dingy
bonnet
she
seemed
in
a
good
temper
she
at
once
said
good
evening
gentlemen
it
for
the
envelope
i
suppose
yes
mme
giry
said
richard
most
amiably
for
the
envelope
and
something
else
besides
at
your
service
richard
at
your
service
and
what
is
the
something
else
please
first
of
all
mme
giry
i
have
a
little
question
to
put
to
you
by
all
means
richard
mme
giry
is
here
to
answer
you
are
you
still
on
good
terms
with
the
ghost
could
be
better
sir
could
be
better
ah
we
are
delighted
look
here
mme
giry
said
richard
in
the
tone
of
making
an
important
confidence
we
may
just
as
well
tell
you
among
ourselves
you
no
fool
why
sir
exclaimed
the
stopping
the
pleasant
nodding
of
the
black
feathers
in
her
dingy
bonnet
i
assure
you
no
one
has
ever
doubted
that
we
are
quite
agreed
and
we
shall
soon
understand
one
another
the
story
of
the
ghost
is
all
humbug
is
it
well
still
between
ourselves
it
has
lasted
long
enough
mme
giry
looked
at
the
managers
as
though
they
were
talking
chinese
she
walked
up
to
richard
table
and
asked
rather
anxiously
what
do
you
mean
i
do
understand
oh
you
understand
quite
well
in
any
case
you
got
to
understand
and
first
of
all
tell
us
his
name
whose
name
the
name
of
the
man
whose
accomplice
you
are
mme
giry
i
am
the
ghost
accomplice
i
his
accomplice
in
what
pray
you
do
all
he
wants
oh
he
not
very
troublesome
you
know
and
does
he
still
tip
you
i
must
complain
how
much
does
he
give
you
for
bringing
him
that
envelope
ten
francs
you
poor
thing
that
not
much
is
it
why
i
tell
you
that
presently
mme
giry
just
now
we
should
like
to
know
for
what
extraordinary
reason
you
have
given
yourself
body
and
soul
to
this
ghost
mme
giry
friendship
and
devotion
are
not
to
be
bought
for
five
francs
or
ten
francs
that
true
enough
and
i
can
tell
you
the
reason
sir
no
disgrace
about
it
on
the
contrary
we
quite
sure
of
that
mme
giry
well
it
like
this
only
the
ghost
does
like
me
to
talk
about
his
business
indeed
sneered
richard
but
this
is
a
matter
that
concerns
myself
alone
well
it
was
in
box
five
one
evening
i
found
a
letter
addressed
to
myself
a
sort
of
note
written
in
red
ink
i
need
read
the
letter
to
you
sir
i
know
it
by
heart
and
i
shall
never
forget
it
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
and
mme
giry
drawing
herself
up
recited
the
letter
with
touching
eloquence
madam
mlle
menetrier
leader
of
the
ballet
became
marquise
de
cussy
mlle
marie
taglioni
a
dancer
became

gilbert
des

la

a
dancer
married
a
brother
of
the

lola

a

became
the

became

theresa
hessier
a

married
dom
fernando
brother
to
the
king

richard
and
moncharmin
listened
to
the
old
woman
who
as
she
proceeded
with
the
enumeration
of
these
glorious
nuptials
swelled
out
took
courage
and
at
last
in
a
voice
bursting
with
pride
flung
out
the
last
sentence
of
the
prophetic
letter
meg
giry
empress
exhausted
by
this
supreme
effort
the
fell
into
a
chair
saying
gentlemen
the
letter
was
signed
ghost
i
had
heard
much
of
the
ghost
but
only
half
believed
in
him
from
the
day
when
he
declared
that
my
little
meg
the
flesh
of
my
flesh
the
fruit
of
my
womb
would
be
empress
i
believed
in
him
altogether
and
really
it
was
not
necessary
to
make
a
long
study
of
mme
excited
features
to
understand
what
could
be
got
out
of
that
fine
intellect
with
the
two
words
ghost
and
empress
but
who
pulled
the
strings
of
that
extraordinary
puppet
that
was
the
question
you
have
never
seen
him
he
speaks
to
you
and
you
believe
all
he
says
asked
moncharmin
yes
to
begin
with
i
owe
it
to
him
that
my
little
meg
was
promoted
to
be
the
leader
of
a
row
i
said
to
the
ghost
she
is
to
be
empress
in
there
is
no
time
to
lose
she
must
become
a
leader
at
once
he
said
upon
it
as
done
and
he
had
only
a
word
to
say
to
poligny
and
the
thing
was
done
so
you
see
that
poligny
saw
him
no
not
any
more
than
i
did
but
he
heard
him
the
ghost
said
a
word
in
his
ear
you
know
on
the
evening
when
he
left
box
five
looking
so
dreadfully
pale
moncharmin
heaved
a
sigh
what
a
business
he
groaned
ah
said
mme
giry
i
always
thought
there
were
secrets
between
the
ghost
and
poligny
anything
that
the
ghost
asked
poligny
to
do
poligny
did
poligny
could
refuse
the
ghost
nothing
you
hear
richard
poligny
could
refuse
the
ghost
nothing
yes
yes
i
hear
said
richard
poligny
is
a
friend
of
the
ghost
and
as
mme
giry
is
a
friend
of
poligny
there
we
are
but
i
do
care
a
hang
about
poligny
he
added
roughly
the
only
person
whose
fate
really
interests
me
is
mme
giry
mme
giry
do
you
know
what
is
in
this
envelope
why
of
course
not
she
said
well
look
mine
giry
looked
into
the
envelope
with
a
lackluster
eye
which
soon
recovered
its
brilliancy
notes
she
cried
yes
mme
giry
notes
and
you
knew
it
i
sir
i
i
swear
do
swear
mme
giry
and
now
i
will
tell
you
the
second
reason
why
i
sent
for
you
mme
giry
i
am
going
to
have
you
arrested
the
two
black
feathers
on
the
dingy
bonnet
which
usually
affected
the
attitude
of
two
notes
of
interrogation
changed
into
two
notes
of
exclamation
as
for
the
bonnet
itself
it
swayed
in
menace
on
the
old
lady
tempestuous
chignon
surprise
indignation
protest
and
dismay
were
furthermore
displayed
by
little
meg
mother
in
a
sort
of
extravagant
movement
of
offended
virtue
half
bound
half
slide
that
brought
her
right
under
the
nose
of
richard
who
could
not
help
pushing
back
his
chair
have
me
arrested
the
mouth
that
spoke
those
words
seemed
to
spit
the
three
teeth
that
were
left
to
it
into
richard
face
richard
behaved
like
a
hero
he
retreated
no
farther
his
threatening
forefinger
seemed
already
to
be
pointing
out
the
keeper
of
box
five
to
the
absent
magistrates
i
am
going
to
have
you
arrested
mme
giry
as
a
thief
say
that
again
and
mme
giry
caught
mr
manager
richard
a
mighty
box
on
the
ear
before
mr
manager
moncharmin
had
time
to
intervene
but
it
was
not
the
withered
hand
of
the
angry
old
beldame
that
fell
on
the
managerial
ear
but
the
envelope
itself
the
cause
of
all
the
trouble
the
magic
envelope
that
opened
with
the
blow
scattering
the
which
escaped
in
a
fantastic
whirl
of
giant
butterflies
the
two
managers
gave
a
shout
and
the
same
thought
made
them
both
go
on
their
knees
feverishly
picking
up
and
hurriedly
examining
the
precious
scraps
of
paper
are
they
still
genuine
moncharmin
are
they
still
genuine
richard
yes
they
are
still
genuine
above
their
heads
mme
giry
three
teeth
were
clashing
in
a
noisy
contest
full
of
hideous
interjections
but
all
that
could
be
clearly
distinguished
was
this
i
a
thief
i
a
thief
i
she
choked
with
rage
she
shouted
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
and
suddenly
she
darted
up
to
richard
again
in
any
case
she
yelped
you
richard
ought
to
know
better
than
i
where
the
twenty
thousand
francs
went
to
i
asked
richard
astounded
and
how
should
i
know
moncharmin
looking
severe
and
dissatisfied
at
once
insisted
that
the
good
lady
should
explain
herself
what
does
this
mean
mme
giry
he
asked
and
why
do
you
say
that
richard
ought
to
know
better
than
you
where
the
francs
went
to
as
for
richard
who
felt
himself
turning
red
under
moncharmin
eyes
he
took
mme
giry
by
the
wrist
and
shook
it
violently
in
a
voice
growling
and
rolling
like
thunder
he
roared
why
should
i
know
better
than
you
where
the
francs
went
to
why
answer
me
because
they
went
into
your
pocket
gasped
the
old
woman
looking
at
him
as
if
he
were
the
devil
incarnate
richard
would
have
rushed
upon
mme
giry
if
moncharmin
had
not
stayed
his
avenging
hand
and
hastened
to
ask
her
more
gently
how
can
you
suspect
my
partner
richard
of
putting
francs
in
his
pocket
i
never
said
that
declared
mme
giry
seeing
that
it
was
myself
who
put
the
francs
into
richard
pocket
and
she
added
under
her
voice
there
it
out
and
may
the
ghost
forgive
me
richard
began
bellowing
anew
but
moncharmin
authoritatively
ordered
him
to
be
silent
allow
me
allow
me
let
the
woman
explain
herself
let
me
question
her
and
he
added
it
is
really
astonishing
that
you
should
take
up
such
a
tone
we
are
on
the
verge
of
clearing
up
the
whole
mystery
and
you
in
a
rage
you
wrong
to
behave
like
that
enjoying
myself
immensely
mme
giry
like
the
martyr
that
she
was
raised
her
head
her
face
beaming
with
faith
in
her
own
innocence
you
tell
me
there
were
francs
in
the
envelope
which
i
put
into
richard
pocket
but
i
tell
you
again
that
i
knew
nothing
about
it
nor
richard
either
for
that
matter
aha
said
richard
suddenly
assuming
a
swaggering
air
which
moncharmin
did
not
like
i
knew
nothing
either
you
put
francs
in
my
pocket
and
i
knew
nothing
either
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
mme
giry
yes
the
terrible
dame
agreed
yes
it
true
we
neither
of
us
knew
anything
but
you
you
must
have
ended
by
finding
out
richard
would
certainly
have
swallowed
mme
giry
alive
if
moncharmin
had
not
been
there
but
moncharmin
protected
her
he
resumed
his
questions
what
sort
of
envelope
did
you
put
in
richard
pocket
it
was
not
the
one
which
we
gave
you
the
one
which
you
took
to
box
five
before
our
eyes
and
yet
that
was
the
one
which
contained
the
francs
i
beg
your
pardon
the
envelope
which
le
directeur
gave
me
was
the
one
which
i
slipped
into
le
directeur
pocket
explained
mme
giry
the
one
which
i
took
to
the
ghost
box
was
another
envelope
just
like
it
which
the
ghost
gave
me
beforehand
and
which
i
hid
up
my
sleeve
so
saying
mme
giry
took
from
her
sleeve
an
envelope
ready
prepared
and
similarly
addressed
to
that
containing
the
francs
the
managers
took
it
from
her
they
examined
it
and
saw
that
it
was
fastened
with
seals
stamped
with
their
own
managerial
seal
they
opened
it
it
contained
twenty
bank
of
st
farce
notes
like
those
which
had
so
much
astounded
them
the
month
before
how
simple
said
richard
how
simple
repeated
moncharmin
and
he
continued
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
mme
giry
as
though
trying
to
hypnotize
her
so
it
was
the
ghost
who
gave
you
this
envelope
and
told
you
to
substitute
it
for
the
one
which
we
gave
you
and
it
was
the
ghost
who
told
you
to
put
the
other
into
richard
pocket
yes
it
was
the
ghost
then
would
you
mind
giving
us
a
specimen
of
your
little
talents
here
is
the
envelope
act
as
though
we
knew
nothing
as
you
please
gentlemen
mme
giry
took
the
envelope
with
the
twenty
notes
inside
it
and
made
for
the
door
she
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
when
the
two
managers
rushed
at
her
oh
no
oh
no
we
not
going
to
be
a
second
time
once
bitten
twice
shy
i
beg
your
pardon
gentlemen
said
the
old
woman
in
you
told
me
to
act
as
though
you
knew
nothing
well
if
you
knew
nothing
i
should
go
away
with
your
envelope
and
then
how
would
you
slip
it
into
my
pocket
argued
richard
whom
moncharmin
fixed
with
his
left
eye
while
keeping
his
right
on
mme
giry
a
proceeding
likely
to
strain
his
sight
but
moncharmin
was
prepared
to
go
to
any
length
to
discover
the
truth
i
am
to
slip
it
into
your
pocket
when
you
least
expect
it
sir
you
know
that
i
always
take
a
little
turn
behind
the
scenes
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
i
often
go
with
my
daughter
to
the
which
i
am
entitled
to
do
as
her
mother
i
bring
her
her
shoes
when
the
ballet
is
about
to
begin
in
fact
i
come
and
go
as
i
please
the
subscribers
come
and
go
too
so
do
you
sir
there
are
lots
of
people
about
i
go
behind
you
and
slip
the
envelope
into
the
of
your
there
no
witchcraft
about
that
no
witchcraft
growled
richard
rolling
his
eyes
like
jupiter
tonans
no
witchcraft
why
i
just
caught
you
in
a
lie
you
old
witch
mme
giry
bristled
with
her
three
teeth
sticking
out
of
her
mouth
and
why
may
i
ask
because
i
spent
that
evening
watching
box
five
and
the
sham
envelope
which
you
put
there
i
did
not
go
to
the
for
a
second
no
sir
and
i
did
not
give
you
the
envelope
that
evening
but
at
the
next
performance
on
the
evening
when
the
of
state
for
fine
arts
at
these
words
richard
suddenly
interrupted
mme
giry
yes
that
true
i
remember
now
the
went
behind
the
scenes
he
asked
for
me
i
went
down
to
the
for
a
moment
i
was
on
the
foyer
steps
the
and
his
chief
clerk
were
in
the
foyer
itself
i
suddenly
turned
around
you
had
passed
behind
me
mme
giry
you
seemed
to
push
against
me
oh
i
can
see
you
still
i
can
see
you
still
yes
that
it
sir
that
it
i
had
just
finished
my
little
business
that
pocket
of
yours
sir
is
very
handy
and
mme
giry
once
more
suited
the
action
to
the
word
she
passed
behind
richard
and
so
nimbly
that
moncharmin
himself
was
impressed
by
it
slipped
the
envelope
into
the
pocket
of
one
of
the
tails
of
richard
of
course
exclaimed
richard
looking
a
little
pale
it
very
clever
of
the
problem
which
he
had
to
solve
was
this
how
to
do
away
with
any
dangerous
intermediary
between
the
man
who
gives
the
francs
and
the
man
who
receives
it
and
by
far
the
best
thing
he
could
hit
upon
was
to
come
and
take
the
money
from
my
pocket
without
my
noticing
it
as
i
myself
did
not
know
that
it
was
there
it
wonderful
oh
wonderful
no
doubt
moncharmin
agreed
only
you
forget
richard
that
i
provided
francs
of
the
twenty
and
that
nobody
put
anything
in
my
pocket
flash
notes
drawn
on
the
bank
of
st
farce
in
france
correspond
with
those
drawn
on
the
bank
of
engraving
in
note
chapter
xvii
the
again
moncharmin
last
phrase
so
dearly
expressed
the
suspicion
in
which
he
now
held
his
partner
that
it
was
bound
to
cause
a
stormy
explanation
at
the
end
of
which
it
was
agreed
that
richard
should
yield
to
all
moncharmin
wishes
with
the
object
of
helping
him
to
discover
the
miscreant
who
was
victimizing
them
this
brings
us
to
the
interval
after
the
garden
act
with
the
strange
conduct
observed
by
remy
and
those
curious
lapses
from
the
dignity
that
might
be
expected
of
the
managers
it
was
arranged
between
richard
and
moncharmin
first
that
richard
should
repeat
the
exact
movements
which
he
had
made
on
the
night
of
the
disappearance
of
the
first
francs
and
second
that
moncharmin
should
not
for
an
instant
lose
sight
of
richard
pocket
into
which
mme
giry
was
to
slip
the
francs
richard
went
and
placed
himself
at
the
identical
spot
where
he
had
stood
when
he
bowed
to
the
for
fine
arts
moncharmin
took
up
his
position
a
few
steps
behind
him
mme
giry
passed
rubbed
up
against
richard
got
rid
of
her
francs
in
the
manager
pocket
and
disappeared
or
rather
she
was
conjured
away
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
received
from
moncharmin
a
few
minutes
earlier
mercier
took
the
good
lady
to
the
office
and
turned
the
key
on
her
thus
making
it
impossible
for
her
to
communicate
with
her
ghost
meanwhile
richard
was
bending
and
bowing
and
scraping
and
walking
backward
just
as
if
he
had
that
high
and
mighty
minister
the
for
fine
arts
before
him
only
though
these
marks
of
politeness
would
have
created
no
astonishment
if
the
of
state
had
really
been
in
front
of
richard
they
caused
an
easily
comprehensible
amazement
to
the
spectators
of
this
very
natural
but
quite
inexplicable
scene
when
richard
had
no
body
in
front
of
him
richard
bowed
to
nobody
bent
his
back
before
nobody
and
walked
backward
before
nobody
and
a
few
steps
behind
him
moncharmin
did
the
same
thing
that
he
was
doing
in
addition
to
pushing
away
remy
and
begging
de
la
borderie
the
ambassador
and
the
manager
of
the
credit
central
not
to
touch
le
directeur
moncharmin
who
had
his
own
ideas
did
not
want
richard
to
come
to
him
presently
when
the
francs
were
gone
and
say
perhaps
it
was
the
ambassador
or
the
manager
of
the
credit
central
or
remy
the
more
so
as
at
the
time
of
the
first
scene
as
richard
himself
admitted
richard
had
met
nobody
in
that
part
of
the
theater
after
mme
giry
had
brushed
up
against
him
having
begun
by
walking
backward
in
order
to
bow
richard
continued
to
do
so
from
prudence
until
he
reached
the
passage
leading
to
the
offices
of
the
management
in
this
way
he
was
constantly
watched
by
moncharmin
from
behind
and
himself
kept
an
eye
on
any
one
approaching
from
the
front
once
more
this
novel
method
of
walking
behind
the
scenes
adopted
by
the
managers
of
our
national
academy
of
music
attracted
attention
but
the
managers
themselves
thought
of
nothing
but
their
francs
on
reaching
the
passage
richard
said
to
moncharmin
in
a
low
voice
i
am
sure
that
nobody
has
touched
me
you
had
now
better
keep
at
some
distance
from
me
and
watch
me
till
i
come
to
door
of
the
office
it
is
better
not
to
arouse
suspicion
and
we
can
see
anything
that
happens
but
moncharmin
replied
no
richard
no
you
walk
ahead
and
walk
immediately
behind
you
i
wo
leave
you
by
a
step
but
in
that
case
exclaimed
richard
they
will
never
steal
our
francs
i
should
hope
not
indeed
declared
moncharmin
then
what
we
are
doing
is
absurd
we
are
doing
exactly
what
we
did
last
time
last
time
i
joined
you
as
you
were
leaving
the
stage
and
followed
close
behind
you
down
this
passage
that
true
sighed
richard
shaking
his
head
and
passively
obeying
moncharmin
two
minutes
later
the
joint
managers
locked
themselves
into
their
office
moncharmin
himself
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
we
remained
locked
up
like
this
last
time
he
said
until
you
left
the
opera
to
go
home
that
so
no
one
came
and
disturbed
us
i
suppose
no
one
then
said
richard
who
was
trying
to
collect
his
memory
then
i
must
certainly
have
been
robbed
on
my
way
home
from
the
opera
no
said
moncharmin
in
a
drier
tone
than
ever
no
impossible
for
i
dropped
you
in
my
cab
the
francs
disappeared
at
your
place
there
not
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
about
that
it
incredible
protested
richard
i
am
sure
of
my
servants
and
if
one
of
them
had
done
it
he
would
have
disappeared
since
moncharmin
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
to
say
that
he
did
not
wish
to
enter
into
details
and
richard
began
to
think
that
moncharmin
was
treating
him
in
a
very
insupportable
fashion
moncharmin
i
had
enough
of
this
richard
i
had
too
much
of
it
do
you
dare
to
suspect
me
yes
of
a
silly
joke
one
does
joke
with
francs
that
what
i
think
declared
moncharmin
unfolding
a
newspaper
and
ostentatiously
studying
its
contents
what
are
you
doing
asked
richard
are
you
going
to
read
the
paper
next
yes
richard
until
i
take
you
home
like
last
time
yes
like
last
time
richard
snatched
the
paper
from
moncharmin
hands
moncharmin
stood
up
more
irritated
than
ever
and
found
himself
faced
by
an
exasperated
richard
who
crossing
his
arms
on
his
chest
said
look
here
i
thinking
of
this
i
thinking
of
what
i
might
think
if
like
last
time
after
my
spending
the
evening
alone
with
you
you
brought
me
home
and
if
at
the
moment
of
parting
i
perceived
that
francs
had
disappeared
from
my
like
last
time
and
what
might
you
think
asked
moncharmin
crimson
with
rage
i
might
think
that
as
you
had
left
me
by
a
foot
breadth
and
as
by
your
own
wish
you
were
the
only
one
to
approach
me
like
last
time
i
might
think
that
if
that
francs
was
no
longer
in
my
pocket
it
stood
a
very
good
chance
of
being
in
yours
moncharmin
leaped
up
at
the
suggestion
oh
he
shouted
a
what
do
you
want
a
for
to
fasten
you
up
with
a
a
you
want
to
fasten
me
with
a
yes
to
fasten
you
to
the
francs
then
whether
here
or
on
the
drive
from
here
to
your
place
or
at
your
place
you
will
feel
the
hand
that
pulls
at
your
pocket
and
you
will
see
if
mine
oh
so
you
suspecting
me
now
are
you
a
and
that
was
the
moment
when
moncharmin
opened
the
door
on
the
passage
and
shouted
a
somebody
give
me
a
and
we
also
know
how
at
the
same
moment
remy
who
had
no
was
received
by
moncharmin
while
a
boy
procured
the
pin
so
eagerly
longed
for
and
what
happened
was
this
moncharmin
first
locked
the
door
again
then
he
knelt
down
behind
richard
back
i
hope
he
said
that
the
notes
are
still
there
so
do
i
said
richard
the
real
ones
asked
moncharmin
resolved
not
to
be
had
this
time
look
for
yourself
said
richard
i
refuse
to
touch
them
moncharmin
took
the
envelope
from
richard
pocket
and
drew
out
the
with
a
trembling
hand
for
this
time
in
order
frequently
to
make
sure
of
the
presence
of
the
notes
he
had
not
sealed
the
envelope
nor
even
fastened
it
he
felt
reassured
on
finding
that
they
were
all
there
and
quite
genuine
he
put
them
back
in
the
and
pinned
them
with
great
care
then
he
sat
down
behind
and
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
them
while
richard
sitting
at
his
did
not
stir
a
little
patience
richard
said
moncharmin
we
have
only
a
few
minutes
to
wait
the
clock
will
soon
strike
twelve
last
time
we
left
at
the
last
stroke
of
twelve
oh
i
shall
have
all
the
patience
necessary
the
time
passed
slow
heavy
mysterious
stifling
richard
tried
to
laugh
i
shall
end
by
believing
in
the
omnipotence
of
the
ghost
he
said
just
now
do
you
find
something
uncomfortable
disquieting
alarming
in
the
atmosphere
of
this
room
you
quite
right
said
moncharmin
who
was
really
impressed
the
ghost
continued
richard
in
a
low
voice
as
though
fearing
lest
he
should
be
overheard
by
invisible
ears
the
ghost
suppose
all
the
same
it
were
a
ghost
who
puts
the
magic
envelopes
on
the
table
who
talks
in
box
five
who
killed
joseph
buquet
who
unhooked
the
chandelier
and
who
robs
us
for
after
all
after
all
after
all
there
is
no
one
here
except
you
and
me
and
if
the
notes
disappear
and
neither
you
nor
i
have
anything
to
do
with
it
well
we
shall
have
to
believe
in
the
ghost
in
the
ghost
at
that
moment
the
clock
on
the
mantlepiece
gave
its
warning
click
and
the
first
stroke
of
twelve
struck
the
two
managers
shuddered
the
perspiration
streamed
from
their
foreheads
the
twelfth
stroke
sounded
strangely
in
their
ears
when
the
clock
stopped
they
gave
a
sigh
and
rose
from
their
chairs
i
think
we
can
go
now
said
moncharmin
i
think
so
richard
a
agreed
before
we
go
do
you
mind
if
i
look
in
your
pocket
but
of
course
moncharmin
you
must
well
he
asked
as
moncharmin
was
feeling
at
the
pocket
well
i
can
feel
the
pin
of
course
as
you
said
we
ca
be
robbed
without
noticing
it
but
moncharmin
whose
hands
were
still
fumbling
bellowed
i
can
feel
the
pin
but
i
ca
feel
the
notes
come
no
joking
moncharmin
this
is
the
time
for
it
well
feel
for
yourself
richard
tore
off
his
coat
the
two
managers
turned
the
pocket
inside
out
the
pocket
was
empty
and
the
curious
thing
was
that
the
pin
remained
stuck
in
the
same
place
richard
and
moncharmin
turned
pale
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
about
the
witchcraft
the
ghost
muttered
moncharmin
but
richard
suddenly
sprang
upon
his
partner
no
one
but
you
has
touched
my
pocket
give
me
back
my
francs
give
me
back
my
francs
on
my
soul
sighed
moncharmin
who
was
ready
to
swoon
on
my
soul
i
swear
that
i
have
got
it
then
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
moncharmin
opened
it
automatically
seemed
hardly
to
recognize
mercier
his
exchanged
a
few
words
with
him
without
knowing
what
he
was
saying
and
with
an
unconscious
movement
put
the
for
which
he
had
no
further
use
into
the
hands
of
his
bewildered
subordinate
chapter
xviii
the
commissary
the
viscount
and
the
persian
the
first
words
of
the
commissary
of
police
on
entering
the
office
were
to
ask
after
the
missing
prima
donna
is
christine
daae
here
christine
daae
here
echoed
richard
no
why
as
for
moncharmin
he
had
not
the
strength
left
to
utter
a
word
richard
repeated
for
the
commissary
and
the
compact
crowd
which
had
followed
him
into
the
office
observed
an
impressive
silence
why
do
you
ask
if
christine
daae
is
here
le
commissaire
because
she
has
to
be
found
declared
the
commissary
of
police
solemnly
what
do
you
mean
she
has
to
be
found
has
she
disappeared
in
the
middle
of
the
performance
in
the
middle
of
the
performance
this
is
extraordinary
is
it
and
what
is
quite
as
extraordinary
is
that
you
should
first
learn
it
from
me
yes
said
richard
taking
his
head
in
his
hands
and
muttering
what
is
this
new
business
oh
it
enough
to
make
a
man
send
in
his
resignation
and
he
pulled
a
few
hairs
out
of
his
mustache
without
even
knowing
what
he
was
doing
so
she
so
she
disappeared
in
the
middle
of
the
performance
he
repeated
yes
she
was
carried
off
in
the
prison
act
at
the
moment
when
she
was
invoking
the
aid
of
the
angels
but
i
doubt
if
she
was
carried
off
by
an
angel
and
i
am
sure
that
she
was
everybody
looked
round
a
young
man
pale
and
trembling
with
excitement
repeated
i
am
sure
of
it
sure
of
what
asked
mifroid
that
christine
daae
was
carried
off
by
an
angel
le
commissaire
and
i
can
tell
you
his
name
aha
le
vicomte
de
chagny
so
you
maintain
that
christine
daae
was
carried
off
by
an
angel
an
angel
of
the
opera
no
doubt
yes
monsieur
by
an
angel
of
the
opera
and
i
will
tell
you
where
he
lives
when
we
are
alone
you
are
right
monsieur
and
the
commissary
of
police
inviting
raoul
to
take
a
chair
cleared
the
room
of
all
the
rest
excepting
the
managers
then
raoul
spoke
le
commissaire
the
angel
is
called
erik
he
lives
in
the
opera
and
he
is
the
angel
of
music
the
angel
of
music
really
that
is
very
curious
the
angel
of
music
and
turning
to
the
managers
mifroid
asked
have
you
an
angel
of
music
on
the
premises
gentlemen
richard
and
moncharmin
shook
their
heads
without
even
speaking
oh
said
the
viscount
those
gentlemen
have
heard
of
the
opera
ghost
well
i
am
in
a
position
to
state
that
the
opera
ghost
and
the
angel
of
music
are
one
and
the
same
person
and
his
real
name
is
erik
mifroid
rose
and
looked
at
raoul
attentively
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
but
is
it
your
intention
to
make
fun
of
the
law
and
if
not
what
is
all
this
about
the
opera
ghost
i
say
that
these
gentlemen
have
heard
of
him
gentlemen
it
appears
that
you
know
the
opera
ghost
richard
rose
with
the
remaining
hairs
of
his
mustache
in
his
hand
no
commissary
no
we
do
not
know
him
but
we
wish
that
we
did
for
this
very
evening
he
has
robbed
us
of
francs
and
richard
turned
a
terrible
look
on
moncharmin
which
seemed
to
say
give
me
back
the
francs
or
i
tell
the
whole
story
moncharmin
understood
what
he
meant
for
with
a
distracted
gesture
he
said
oh
tell
everything
and
have
done
with
it
as
for
mifroid
he
looked
at
the
managers
and
at
raoul
by
turns
and
wondered
whether
he
had
strayed
into
a
lunatic
asylum
he
passed
his
hand
through
his
hair
a
ghost
he
said
who
on
the
same
evening
carries
off
an
and
steals
francs
is
a
ghost
who
must
have
his
hands
very
full
if
you
do
mind
we
will
take
the
questions
in
order
the
singer
first
the
francs
after
come
de
chagny
let
us
try
to
talk
seriously
you
believe
that
mlle
christine
daae
has
been
carried
off
by
an
individual
called
erik
do
you
know
this
person
have
you
seen
him
yes
where
in
a
church
yard
mifroid
gave
a
start
began
to
scrutinize
raoul
again
and
said
of
course
that
where
ghosts
usually
hang
out
and
what
were
you
doing
in
that
churchyard
monsieur
said
raoul
i
can
quite
understand
how
absurd
my
replies
must
seem
to
you
but
i
beg
you
to
believe
that
i
am
in
full
possession
of
my
faculties
the
safety
of
the
person
dearest
to
me
in
the
world
is
at
stake
i
should
like
to
convince
you
in
a
few
words
for
time
is
pressing
and
every
minute
is
valuable
unfortunately
if
i
do
not
tell
you
the
strangest
story
that
ever
was
from
the
beginning
you
will
not
believe
me
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
about
the
opera
ghost
commissary
alas
i
do
not
know
much
never
mind
go
on
go
on
exclaimed
richard
and
moncharmin
suddenly
greatly
interested
unfortunately
for
their
hopes
of
learning
some
detail
that
could
put
them
on
the
track
of
their
hoaxer
they
were
soon
compelled
to
accept
the
fact
that
raoul
de
chagny
had
completely
lost
his
head
all
that
story
about
death
heads
and
enchanted
violins
could
only
have
taken
birth
in
the
disordered
brain
of
a
youth
mad
with
love
it
was
evident
also
that
commissary
mifroid
shared
their
view
and
the
magistrate
would
certainly
have
cut
short
the
incoherent
narrative
if
circumstances
had
not
taken
it
upon
themselves
to
interrupt
it
the
door
opened
and
a
man
entered
curiously
dressed
in
an
enormous
and
a
tall
hat
at
once
shabby
and
shiny
that
came
down
to
his
ears
he
went
up
to
the
commissary
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
whisper
it
was
doubtless
a
detective
come
to
deliver
an
important
communication
during
this
conversation
mifroid
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
raoul
at
last
addressing
him
he
said
monsieur
we
have
talked
enough
about
the
ghost
we
will
now
talk
about
yourself
a
little
if
you
have
no
objection
you
were
to
carry
off
mlle
christine
daae
yes
le
commissaire
after
the
performance
yes
le
commissaire
all
your
arrangements
were
made
yes
le
commissaire
the
carriage
that
brought
you
was
to
take
you
both
away
there
were
fresh
horses
in
readiness
at
every
stage
that
is
true
le
commissaire
and
nevertheless
your
carriage
is
still
outside
the
rotunda
awaiting
your
orders
is
it
not
yes
le
commissaire
did
you
know
that
there
were
three
other
carriages
there
in
addition
to
yours
i
did
not
pay
the
least
attention
they
were
the
carriages
of
mlle
sorelli
which
could
not
find
room
in
the
cour
de
of
carlotta
and
of
your
brother
le
comte
de
chagny
very
likely
what
is
certain
is
that
though
your
carriage
and
sorelli
and
carlotta
are
still
there
by
the
rotunda
pavement
le
comte
de
chagny
carriage
is
gone
this
has
nothing
to
say
to
i
beg
your
pardon
was
not
le
comte
opposed
to
your
marriage
with
mlle
daae
that
is
a
matter
that
only
concerns
the
family
you
have
answered
my
question
he
was
opposed
to
it
and
that
was
why
you
were
carrying
christine
daae
out
of
your
brother
reach
well
de
chagny
allow
me
to
inform
you
that
your
brother
has
been
smarter
than
you
it
is
he
who
has
carried
off
christine
daae
oh
impossible
moaned
raoul
pressing
his
hand
to
his
heart
are
you
sure
immediately
after
the
artist
disappearance
which
was
procured
by
means
which
we
have
still
to
ascertain
he
flung
into
his
carriage
which
drove
right
across
paris
at
a
furious
pace
across
paris
asked
poor
raoul
in
a
hoarse
voice
what
do
you
mean
by
across
paris
across
paris
and
out
of
paris
by
the
brussels
road
oh
cried
the
young
man
i
shall
catch
them
and
he
rushed
out
of
the
office
and
bring
her
back
to
us
cried
the
commisary
gaily
ah
a
trick
worth
two
of
the
angel
of
music
and
turning
to
his
audience
mifroid
delivered
a
little
lecture
on
police
methods
i
do
know
for
a
moment
whether
le
comte
de
chagny
has
really
carried
christine
daae
off
or
not
but
i
want
to
know
and
i
believe
that
at
this
moment
no
one
is
more
anxious
to
inform
us
than
his
brother
and
now
he
is
flying
in
pursuit
of
him
he
is
my
chief
auxiliary
this
gentlemen
is
the
art
of
the
police
which
is
believed
to
be
so
complicated
and
which
nevertheless
appears
so
simple
as
soon
its
you
see
that
it
consists
in
getting
your
work
done
by
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
police
but
le
commissaire
de
police
mifroid
would
not
have
been
quite
so
satisfied
with
himself
if
he
had
known
that
the
rush
of
his
rapid
emissary
was
stopped
at
the
entrance
to
the
very
first
corridor
a
tall
figure
blocked
raoul
way
where
are
you
going
so
fast
de
chagny
asked
a
voice
raoul
impatiently
raised
his
eyes
and
recognized
the
astrakhan
cap
of
an
hour
ago
he
stopped
it
you
he
cried
in
a
feverish
voice
you
who
know
secrets
and
do
want
me
to
speak
of
them
who
are
you
you
know
who
i
am
i
am
the
persian
chapter
xix
the
viscount
and
the
persian
raoul
now
remembered
that
his
brother
had
once
shown
him
that
mysterious
person
of
whom
nothing
was
known
except
that
he
was
a
persian
and
that
he
lived
in
a
little
flat
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
the
man
with
the
ebony
skin
the
eyes
of
jade
and
the
astrakhan
cap
bent
over
raoul
i
hope
de
chagny
he
said
that
you
have
not
betrayed
secret
and
why
should
i
hesitate
to
betray
that
monster
sir
raoul
rejoined
haughtily
trying
to
shake
off
the
intruder
is
he
your
friend
by
any
chance
i
hope
that
you
said
nothing
about
erik
sir
because
erik
secret
is
also
christine
daae
and
to
talk
about
one
is
to
talk
about
the
other
oh
sir
said
raoul
becoming
more
and
more
impatient
you
seem
to
know
about
many
things
that
interest
me
and
yet
i
have
no
time
to
listen
to
you
once
more
de
chagny
where
are
you
going
so
fast
can
not
you
guess
to
christine
daae
assistance
then
sir
stay
here
for
christine
daae
is
here
with
erik
with
erik
how
do
you
know
i
was
at
the
performance
and
no
one
in
the
world
but
erik
could
contrive
an
abduction
like
that
oh
he
said
with
a
deep
sigh
i
recognized
the
monster
touch
you
know
him
then
the
persian
did
not
reply
but
heaved
a
fresh
sigh
sir
said
raoul
i
do
not
know
what
your
intentions
are
but
can
you
do
anything
to
help
me
i
mean
to
help
christine
daae
i
think
so
de
chagny
and
that
is
why
i
spoke
to
you
what
can
you
do
try
to
take
you
to
her
and
to
him
if
you
can
do
me
that
service
sir
my
life
is
yours
one
word
more
the
commissary
of
police
tells
me
that
christine
daae
has
been
carried
off
by
my
brother
count
philippe
oh
de
chagny
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
it
not
possible
is
it
i
do
know
if
it
is
possible
or
not
but
there
are
ways
and
ways
of
carrying
people
off
and
le
comte
philippe
has
never
as
far
as
i
know
had
anything
to
do
with
witchcraft
your
arguments
are
convincing
sir
and
i
am
a
fool
oh
let
us
make
haste
i
place
myself
entirely
in
your
hands
how
should
i
not
believe
you
when
you
are
the
only
one
to
believe
me
when
you
are
the
only
one
not
to
smile
when
erik
name
is
mentioned
and
the
young
man
impetuously
seized
the
persian
hands
they
were
silence
said
the
persian
stopping
and
listening
to
the
distant
sounds
of
the
theater
we
must
not
mention
that
name
here
let
us
say
and
then
there
will
be
less
danger
of
attracting
his
attention
do
you
think
he
is
near
us
it
is
quite
possible
sir
if
he
is
not
at
this
moment
with
his
victim
in
the
house
on
the
lake
ah
so
you
know
that
house
too
if
he
is
not
there
he
may
be
here
in
this
wall
in
this
floor
in
this
ceiling
come
and
the
persian
asking
raoul
to
deaden
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
led
him
down
passages
which
raoul
had
never
seen
before
even
at
the
time
when
christine
used
to
take
him
for
walks
through
that
labyrinth
if
only
darius
has
come
said
the
persian
who
is
darius
darius
my
servant
they
were
now
in
the
center
of
a
real
deserted
square
an
immense
apartment
by
a
small
lamp
the
persian
stopped
raoul
and
in
the
softest
of
whispers
asked
what
did
you
say
to
the
commissary
i
said
that
christine
daae
abductor
was
the
angel
of
music
alias
the
opera
ghost
and
that
the
real
name
was
hush
and
did
he
believe
you
no
he
attached
no
importance
to
what
you
said
no
he
took
you
for
a
bit
of
a
madman
yes
so
much
the
better
sighed
the
persian
and
they
continued
their
road
after
going
up
and
down
several
staircases
which
raoul
had
never
seen
before
the
two
men
found
themselves
in
front
of
a
door
which
the
persian
opened
with
a
the
persian
and
raoul
were
both
of
course
in
but
whereas
raoul
had
a
tall
hat
the
persian
wore
the
astrakhan
cap
which
i
have
already
mentioned
it
was
an
infringement
of
the
rule
which
insists
upon
the
tall
hat
behind
the
scenes
but
in
france
foreigners
are
allowed
every
license
the
englishman
his
the
persian
his
cap
of
astrakhan
sir
said
the
persian
your
tall
hat
will
be
in
your
way
you
would
do
well
to
leave
it
in
the
what
asked
raoul
christine
daae
and
the
persian
letting
raoul
through
the
door
which
he
had
just
opened
showed
him
the
actress
room
opposite
they
were
at
the
end
of
the
passage
the
whole
length
of
which
raoul
had
been
accustomed
to
traverse
before
knocking
at
christine
door
how
well
you
know
the
opera
sir
not
so
well
as
does
said
the
persian
modestly
and
he
pushed
the
young
man
into
christine
which
was
as
raoul
had
left
it
a
few
minutes
earlier
closing
the
door
the
persian
went
to
a
very
thin
partition
that
separated
the
from
a
big
next
to
it
he
listened
and
then
coughed
loudly
there
was
a
sound
of
some
one
stirring
in
the
and
a
few
seconds
later
a
finger
tapped
at
the
door
come
in
said
the
persian
a
man
entered
also
wearing
an
astrakhan
cap
and
dressed
in
a
long
overcoat
he
bowed
and
took
a
richly
carved
case
from
under
his
coat
put
it
on
the
bowed
once
again
and
went
to
the
door
did
no
one
see
you
come
in
darius
no
master
let
no
one
see
you
go
out
the
servant
glanced
down
the
passage
and
swiftly
disappeared
the
persian
opened
the
case
it
contained
a
pair
of
long
pistols
when
christine
daae
was
carried
off
sir
i
sent
word
to
my
servant
to
bring
me
these
pistols
i
have
had
them
a
long
time
and
they
can
be
relied
upon
do
you
mean
to
fight
a
duel
asked
the
young
man
it
will
certainly
be
a
duel
which
we
shall
have
to
fight
said
the
other
examining
the
priming
of
his
pistols
and
what
a
duel
handing
one
of
the
pistols
to
raoul
he
added
in
this
duel
we
shall
be
two
to
one
but
you
must
be
prepared
for
everything
for
we
shall
be
fighting
the
most
terrible
adversary
that
you
can
imagine
but
you
love
christine
daae
do
you
not
i
worship
the
ground
she
stands
on
but
you
sir
who
do
not
love
her
tell
me
why
i
find
you
ready
to
risk
your
life
for
her
you
must
certainly
hate
erik
no
sir
said
the
persian
sadly
i
do
not
hate
him
if
i
hated
him
he
would
long
ago
have
ceased
doing
harm
has
he
done
you
harm
i
have
forgiven
him
the
harm
which
he
has
done
me
i
do
not
understand
you
you
treat
him
as
a
monster
you
speak
of
his
crime
he
has
done
you
harm
and
i
find
in
you
the
same
inexplicable
pity
that
drove
me
to
despair
when
i
saw
it
in
christine
the
persian
did
not
reply
he
fetched
a
stool
and
set
it
against
the
wall
facing
the
great
mirror
that
filled
the
whole
of
the
opposite
then
he
climbed
on
the
stool
and
with
his
nose
to
the
wallpaper
seemed
to
be
looking
for
something
ah
he
said
after
a
long
search
i
have
it
and
raising
his
finger
above
his
head
he
pressed
against
a
corner
in
the
pattern
of
the
paper
then
he
turned
round
and
jumped
off
the
stool
in
half
a
minute
he
said
he
shall
be
on
his
road
and
crossing
the
whole
of
the
he
felt
the
great
mirror
no
it
is
not
yielding
yet
he
muttered
oh
are
we
going
out
by
the
mirror
asked
raoul
like
christine
daae
so
you
knew
that
christine
daae
went
out
by
that
mirror
she
did
so
before
my
eyes
sir
i
was
hidden
behind
the
curtain
of
the
inner
room
and
i
saw
her
vanish
not
by
the
glass
but
in
the
glass
and
what
did
you
do
i
thought
it
was
an
aberration
of
my
senses
a
mad
dream
or
some
new
fancy
of
the
ghost
chuckled
the
persian
ah
de
chagny
he
continued
still
with
his
hand
on
the
mirror
would
that
we
had
to
do
with
a
ghost
we
could
then
leave
our
pistols
in
their
case
put
down
your
hat
please
there
and
now
cover
your
as
much
as
you
can
with
your
coat
as
i
am
doing
bring
the
lapels
forward
turn
up
the
collar
we
must
make
ourselves
as
invisible
as
possible
bearing
against
the
mirror
after
a
short
silence
he
said
it
takes
some
time
to
release
the
counterbalance
when
you
press
on
the
spring
from
the
inside
of
the
room
it
is
different
when
you
are
behind
the
wall
and
can
act
directly
on
the
counterbalance
then
the
mirror
turns
at
once
and
is
moved
with
incredible
rapidity
what
counterbalance
asked
raoul
why
the
counterbalance
that
lifts
the
whole
of
this
wall
on
to
its
pivot
you
surely
do
expect
it
to
move
of
itself
by
enchantment
if
you
watch
you
will
see
the
mirror
first
rise
an
inch
or
two
and
then
shift
an
inch
or
two
from
left
to
right
it
will
then
be
on
a
pivot
and
will
swing
round
it
not
turning
said
raoul
impatiently
oh
wait
you
have
time
enough
to
be
impatient
sir
the
mechanism
has
obviously
become
rusty
or
else
the
spring
is
working
unless
it
is
something
else
added
the
persian
anxiously
what
he
may
simply
have
cut
the
cord
of
the
counterbalance
and
blocked
the
whole
apparatus
why
should
he
he
does
not
know
that
we
are
coming
this
way
i
dare
say
he
suspects
it
for
he
knows
that
i
understand
the
system
it
not
turning
and
christine
sir
christine
the
persian
said
coldly
we
shall
do
all
that
it
is
humanly
possible
to
do
but
he
may
stop
us
at
the
first
step
he
commands
the
walls
the
doors
and
the
trapdoors
in
my
country
he
was
known
by
a
name
which
means
the
lover
but
why
do
these
walls
obey
him
alone
he
did
not
build
them
yes
sir
that
is
just
what
he
did
raoul
looked
at
him
in
amazement
but
the
persian
made
a
sign
to
him
to
be
silent
and
pointed
to
the
glass
there
was
a
sort
of
shivering
reflection
their
image
was
troubled
as
in
a
rippling
sheet
of
water
and
then
all
became
stationary
again
you
see
sir
that
it
is
not
turning
let
us
take
another
road
there
is
no
other
declared
the
persian
in
a
singularly
mournful
voice
and
now
look
out
and
be
ready
to
fire
he
himself
raised
his
pistol
opposite
the
glass
raoul
imitated
his
movement
with
his
free
arm
the
persian
drew
the
young
man
to
his
chest
and
suddenly
the
mirror
turned
in
a
blinding
daze
of
it
turned
like
one
of
those
revolving
doors
which
have
lately
been
fixed
to
the
entrances
of
most
restaurants
it
turned
carrying
raoul
and
the
persian
with
it
and
suddenly
hurling
them
from
the
full
light
into
the
deepest
darkness
chapter
xx
in
the
cellars
of
the
opera
your
hand
high
ready
to
fire
repeated
raoul
companion
quickly
the
wall
behind
them
having
completed
the
circle
which
it
described
upon
itself
closed
again
and
the
two
men
stood
motionless
for
a
moment
holding
their
breath
at
last
the
persian
decided
to
make
a
movement
and
raoul
heard
him
slip
on
his
knees
and
feel
for
something
in
the
dark
with
his
groping
hands
suddenly
the
darkness
was
made
visible
by
a
small
dark
lantern
and
raoul
instinctively
stepped
backward
as
though
to
escape
the
scrutiny
of
a
secret
enemy
but
he
soon
perceived
that
the
light
belonged
to
the
persian
whose
movements
he
was
closely
observing
the
little
red
disk
was
turned
in
every
direction
and
raoul
saw
that
the
floor
the
walls
and
the
ceiling
were
all
formed
of
planking
it
must
have
been
the
ordinary
road
taken
by
erik
to
reach
and
impose
upon
her
innocence
and
raoul
remembering
the
persian
remark
thought
that
it
had
been
mysteriously
constructed
by
the
ghost
himself
later
he
learned
that
erik
had
found
all
prepared
for
him
a
secret
passage
long
known
to
himself
alone
and
contrived
at
the
time
of
the
paris
commune
to
allow
the
jailers
to
convey
their
prisoners
straight
to
the
dungeons
that
had
been
constructed
for
them
in
the
cellars
for
the
federates
had
occupied
the
immediately
after
the
eighteenth
of
march
and
had
made
a
right
at
the
top
for
their
mongolfier
balloons
which
carried
their
incendiary
proclamations
to
the
departments
and
a
state
prison
right
at
the
bottom
the
persian
went
on
his
knees
and
put
his
lantern
on
the
ground
he
seemed
to
be
working
at
the
floor
and
suddenly
he
turned
off
his
light
then
raoul
heard
a
faint
click
and
saw
a
very
pale
luminous
square
in
the
floor
of
the
passage
it
was
as
though
a
window
had
opened
on
the
opera
cellars
which
were
still
lit
raoul
no
longer
saw
the
persian
but
he
suddenly
felt
him
by
his
side
and
heard
him
whisper
follow
me
and
do
all
that
i
do
raoul
turned
to
the
luminous
aperture
then
he
saw
the
persian
who
was
still
on
his
knees
hang
by
his
hands
from
the
rim
of
the
opening
with
his
pistol
between
his
teeth
and
slide
into
the
cellar
below
curiously
enough
the
viscount
had
absolute
confidence
in
the
persian
though
he
knew
nothing
about
him
his
emotion
when
speaking
of
the
monster
struck
him
as
sincere
and
if
the
persian
had
cherished
any
sinister
designs
against
him
he
would
not
have
armed
him
with
his
own
hands
besides
raoul
must
reach
christine
at
all
costs
he
therefore
went
on
his
knees
also
and
hung
from
the
trap
with
both
hands
let
go
said
a
voice
and
he
dropped
into
the
arms
of
the
persian
who
told
him
to
lie
down
flat
closed
the
above
him
and
crouched
down
beside
him
raoul
tried
to
ask
a
question
but
the
persian
hand
was
on
his
mouth
and
he
heard
a
voice
which
he
recognized
as
that
of
the
commissary
of
police
raoul
and
the
persian
were
completely
hidden
behind
a
wooden
partition
near
them
a
small
staircase
led
to
a
little
room
in
which
the
commissary
appeared
to
be
walking
up
and
down
asking
questions
the
faint
light
was
just
enough
to
enable
raoul
to
distinguish
the
shape
of
things
around
him
and
he
could
not
restrain
a
dull
cry
there
were
three
corpses
there
the
first
lay
on
the
narrow
landing
of
the
little
staircase
the
two
others
had
rolled
to
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
raoul
could
have
touched
one
of
the
two
poor
wretches
by
passing
his
fingers
through
the
partition
silence
whispered
the
persian
he
too
had
seen
the
bodies
and
he
gave
one
word
in
explanation
he
the
commissary
voice
was
now
heard
more
distinctly
he
was
asking
for
information
about
the
system
of
lighting
which
the
supplied
the
commissary
therefore
must
be
in
the
organ
or
its
immediate
neighborhood
contrary
to
what
one
might
think
especially
in
connection
with
an
the
organ
is
not
a
musical
instrument
at
that
time
electricity
was
employed
only
for
a
very
few
scenic
effects
and
for
the
bells
the
immense
building
and
the
stage
itself
were
still
lit
by
gas
hydrogen
was
used
to
regulate
and
modify
the
lighting
of
a
scene
and
this
was
done
by
means
of
a
special
apparatus
which
because
of
the
multiplicity
of
its
pipes
was
known
as
the
organ
a
box
beside
the
prompter
box
was
reserved
for
the
chief
who
from
there
gave
his
orders
to
his
assistants
and
saw
that
they
were
executed
mauclair
stayed
in
this
box
during
all
the
performances
but
now
mauclair
was
not
in
his
box
and
his
assistants
not
in
their
places
mauclair
mauclair
the
voice
echoed
through
the
cellars
but
mauclair
did
not
reply
i
have
said
that
a
door
opened
on
a
little
staircase
that
led
to
the
second
cellar
the
commissary
pushed
it
but
it
resisted
i
say
he
said
to
the
i
ca
open
this
door
is
it
always
so
difficult
the
forced
it
open
with
his
shoulder
he
saw
that
at
the
same
time
he
was
pushing
a
human
body
and
he
could
not
keep
back
an
exclamation
for
he
recognized
the
body
at
once
mauclair
poor
devil
he
is
dead
but
commissary
mifroid
whom
nothing
surprised
was
stooping
over
that
big
body
no
he
said
he
is
which
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
it
the
first
time
if
so
said
the
then
some
one
has
given
him
a
narcotic
that
is
quite
possible
mifroid
went
down
a
few
steps
and
said
look
by
the
light
of
a
little
red
lantern
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
they
saw
two
other
bodies
the
recognized
assistants
mifroid
went
down
and
listened
to
their
breathing
they
are
sound
asleep
he
said
very
curious
business
some
person
unknown
must
have
interfered
with
the
and
his
staff
and
that
person
unknown
was
obviously
working
on
behalf
of
the
kidnapper
but
what
a
funny
idea
to
kidnap
a
performer
on
the
stage
send
for
the
doctor
of
the
theater
please
and
mifroid
repeated
curious
decidedly
curious
business
then
he
turned
to
the
little
room
addressing
the
people
whom
raoul
and
the
persian
were
unable
to
see
from
where
they
lay
what
do
you
say
to
all
this
gentlemen
you
are
the
only
ones
who
have
not
given
your
views
and
yet
you
must
have
an
opinion
of
some
sort
thereupon
raoul
and
the
persian
saw
the
startled
faces
of
the
joint
managers
appear
above
the
landing
and
they
heard
moncharmin
excited
voice
there
are
things
happening
here
commissary
which
we
are
unable
to
explain
and
the
two
faces
disappeared
thank
you
for
the
information
gentlemen
said
mifroid
with
a
jeer
but
the
holding
his
chin
in
the
hollow
of
his
right
hand
which
is
the
attitude
of
profound
thought
said
it
is
not
the
first
time
that
mauclair
has
fallen
asleep
in
the
theater
i
remember
finding
him
one
evening
snoring
in
his
little
recess
with
his
beside
him
is
that
long
ago
asked
mifroid
carefully
wiping
his
no
not
so
very
long
ago
wait
a
bit
it
was
the
night
of
course
yes
it
was
the
night
when
carlotta
you
know
commissary
gave
her
famous
really
the
night
when
carlotta
gave
her
famous
and
mifroid
replacing
his
gleaming
glasses
on
his
nose
fixed
the
with
a
contemplative
stare
so
mauclair
takes
snuff
does
he
he
asked
carelessly
commissary
look
there
is
his
on
that
little
shelf
oh
he
a
great
so
am
i
said
mifroid
and
put
the
in
his
pocket
raoul
and
the
persian
themselves
unobserved
watched
the
removal
of
the
three
bodies
by
a
number
of
who
were
followed
by
the
commissary
and
all
the
people
with
him
their
steps
were
heard
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
stage
above
when
they
were
alone
the
persian
made
a
sign
to
raoul
to
stand
up
raoul
did
so
but
as
he
did
not
lift
his
hand
in
front
of
his
eyes
ready
to
fire
the
persian
told
him
to
resume
that
attitude
and
to
continue
it
whatever
happened
but
it
tires
the
hand
unnecessarily
whispered
raoul
if
i
do
fire
i
sha
be
sure
of
my
aim
then
shift
your
pistol
to
the
other
hand
said
the
persian
i
ca
shoot
with
my
left
hand
thereupon
the
persian
made
this
queer
reply
which
was
certainly
not
calculated
to
throw
light
into
the
young
man
flurried
brain
it
not
a
question
of
shooting
with
the
right
hand
or
the
left
a
question
of
holding
one
of
your
hands
as
though
you
were
going
to
pull
the
trigger
of
a
pistol
with
your
arm
bent
as
for
the
pistol
itself
when
all
is
said
you
can
put
that
in
your
pocket
and
he
added
let
this
be
clearly
understood
or
i
will
answer
for
nothing
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
and
now
silence
and
follow
me
the
cellars
of
the
opera
are
enormous
and
they
are
five
in
number
raoul
followed
the
persian
and
wondered
what
he
would
have
done
without
his
companion
in
that
extraordinary
labyrinth
they
went
down
to
the
third
cellar
and
their
progress
was
still
lit
by
some
distant
lamp
the
lower
they
went
the
more
precautions
the
persian
seemed
to
take
he
kept
on
turning
to
raoul
to
see
if
he
was
holding
his
arm
properly
showing
him
how
he
himself
carried
his
hand
as
if
always
ready
to
fire
though
the
pistol
was
in
his
pocket
suddenly
a
loud
voice
made
them
stop
some
one
above
them
shouted
all
the
on
the
stage
the
commissary
of
police
wants
them
steps
were
heard
and
shadows
glided
through
the
darkness
the
persian
drew
raoul
behind
a
set
piece
they
saw
passing
before
and
above
them
old
men
bent
by
age
and
the
past
burden
of
some
could
hardly
drag
themselves
along
others
from
habit
with
stooping
bodies
and
outstretched
hands
looked
for
doors
to
shut
they
were
the
the
old
on
whom
a
charitable
management
had
taken
pity
giving
them
the
job
of
shutting
doors
above
and
below
the
stage
they
went
about
incessantly
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
building
shutting
the
doors
and
they
were
also
called
the
at
least
at
that
time
for
i
have
little
doubt
that
by
now
they
are
all
dead
drafts
are
very
bad
for
the
voice
wherever
they
may
come
from
the
two
men
might
have
stumbled
over
them
waking
them
up
and
provoking
a
request
for
explanations
for
the
moment
mifroid
inquiry
saved
them
from
any
such
unpleasant
encounters
the
persian
and
raoul
welcomed
this
incident
which
relieved
them
of
inconvenient
witnesses
for
some
of
those
having
nothing
else
to
do
or
nowhere
to
lay
their
heads
stayed
at
the
opera
from
idleness
or
necessity
and
spent
the
night
there
but
they
were
not
left
to
enjoy
their
solitude
for
long
other
shades
now
came
down
by
the
same
way
by
which
the
had
gone
up
each
of
these
shades
carried
a
little
lantern
and
moved
it
about
above
below
and
all
around
as
though
looking
for
something
or
somebody
hang
it
muttered
the
persian
i
do
know
what
they
are
looking
for
but
they
might
easily
find
us
let
us
get
away
quick
your
hand
up
sir
ready
to
fire
bend
your
arm
more
it
hand
at
the
level
of
your
eye
as
though
you
were
fighting
a
duel
and
waiting
for
the
word
to
fire
oh
leave
your
pistol
in
your
pocket
quick
come
along
level
of
your
eye
question
of
life
or
death
here
this
way
these
stairs
they
reached
the
fifth
cellar
oh
what
a
duel
sir
what
a
duel
once
in
the
fifth
cellar
the
persian
drew
breath
he
seemed
to
enjoy
a
rather
greater
sense
of
security
than
he
had
displayed
when
they
both
stopped
in
the
third
but
he
never
altered
the
attitude
of
his
hand
and
raoul
remembering
the
persian
observation
i
know
these
pistols
can
be
relied
upon
was
more
and
more
astonished
wondering
why
any
one
should
be
so
gratified
at
being
able
to
rely
upon
a
pistol
which
he
did
not
intend
to
use
but
the
persian
left
him
no
time
for
reflection
telling
raoul
to
stay
where
he
was
he
ran
up
a
few
steps
of
the
staircase
which
they
had
just
left
and
then
returned
how
stupid
of
us
he
whispered
we
shall
soon
have
seen
the
end
of
those
men
with
their
lanterns
it
is
the
firemen
going
their
rounds
the
two
men
waited
five
minutes
longer
then
the
persian
took
raoul
up
the
stairs
again
but
suddenly
he
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
something
moved
in
the
darkness
before
them
flat
on
your
stomach
whispered
the
persian
the
two
men
lay
flat
on
the
floor
they
were
only
just
in
time
a
shade
this
time
carrying
no
light
just
a
shade
in
the
shade
passed
it
passed
close
to
them
near
enough
to
touch
them
they
felt
the
warmth
of
its
cloak
upon
them
for
they
could
distinguish
the
shade
sufficiently
to
see
that
it
wore
a
cloak
which
shrouded
it
from
head
to
foot
on
its
head
it
had
a
soft
felt
hat
it
moved
away
drawing
its
feet
against
the
walls
and
sometimes
giving
a
kick
into
a
corner
whew
said
the
persian
we
had
a
narrow
escape
that
shade
knows
me
and
has
twice
taken
me
to
the
managers
office
is
it
some
one
belonging
to
the
theater
police
asked
raoul
it
some
one
much
worse
than
that
replied
the
persian
without
giving
any
further
explanation
it
not
he
he
if
he
does
not
come
behind
us
we
shall
always
see
his
yellow
eyes
that
is
more
or
less
our
safeguard
but
he
may
come
from
behind
stealing
up
and
we
are
dead
men
if
we
do
not
keep
our
hands
as
though
about
to
fire
at
the
level
of
our
eyes
in
front
the
persian
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
a
fantastic
face
came
in
sight
a
whole
fiery
face
not
only
two
yellow
eyes
yes
a
head
of
fire
came
toward
them
at
a
man
height
but
with
no
body
attached
to
it
the
face
shed
fire
looked
in
the
darkness
like
a
flame
shaped
as
a
man
face
oh
said
the
persian
between
his
teeth
i
have
never
seen
this
before
pampin
was
not
mad
after
all
he
had
seen
it
what
can
that
flame
be
it
is
not
he
but
he
may
have
sent
it
take
care
take
care
your
hand
at
the
level
of
your
eyes
in
name
at
the
level
of
your
eyes
know
most
of
his
tricks
but
not
this
one
come
let
us
run
it
is
safer
hand
at
the
level
of
your
eyes
and
they
fled
down
the
long
passage
that
opened
before
them
after
a
few
seconds
that
seemed
to
them
like
long
minutes
they
stopped
he
does
often
come
this
way
said
the
persian
this
side
has
nothing
to
do
with
him
this
side
does
not
lead
to
the
lake
nor
to
the
house
on
the
lake
but
perhaps
he
knows
that
we
are
at
his
heels
although
i
promised
him
to
leave
him
alone
and
never
to
meddle
in
his
business
again
so
saying
he
turned
his
head
and
raoul
also
turned
his
head
and
they
again
saw
the
head
of
fire
behind
their
two
heads
it
had
followed
them
and
it
must
have
run
also
and
perhaps
faster
than
they
for
it
seemed
to
be
nearer
to
them
at
the
same
time
they
began
to
perceive
a
certain
noise
of
which
they
could
not
guess
the
nature
they
simply
noticed
that
the
sound
seemed
to
move
and
to
approach
with
the
fiery
face
it
was
a
noise
as
though
thousands
of
nails
had
been
scraped
against
a
blackboard
the
perfectly
unendurable
noise
that
is
sometimes
made
by
a
little
stone
inside
the
chalk
that
grates
on
the
blackboard
they
continued
to
retreat
but
the
fiery
face
came
on
came
on
gaining
on
them
they
could
see
its
features
clearly
now
the
eyes
were
round
and
staring
the
nose
a
little
crooked
and
the
mouth
large
with
a
hanging
lower
lip
very
like
the
eyes
nose
and
lip
of
the
moon
when
the
moon
is
quite
red
bright
red
how
did
that
red
moon
manage
to
glide
through
the
darkness
at
a
height
with
nothing
to
support
it
at
least
apparently
and
how
did
it
go
so
fast
so
straight
ahead
with
such
staring
staring
eyes
and
what
was
that
scratching
scraping
grating
sound
which
it
brought
with
it
the
persian
and
raoul
could
retreat
no
farther
and
flattened
themselves
against
the
wall
not
knowing
what
was
going
to
happen
because
of
that
incomprehensible
head
of
fire
and
especially
now
because
of
the
more
intense
swarming
living
numerous
sound
for
the
sound
was
certainly
made
up
of
hundreds
of
little
sounds
that
moved
in
the
darkness
under
the
fiery
face
and
the
fiery
face
came
on
with
its
noise
came
level
with
them
and
the
two
companions
flat
against
their
wall
felt
their
hair
stand
on
end
with
horror
for
they
now
knew
what
the
thousand
noises
meant
they
came
in
a
troop
hustled
along
in
the
shadow
by
innumerable
little
hurried
waves
swifter
than
the
waves
that
rush
over
the
sands
at
high
tide
little
foaming
under
the
moon
under
the
fiery
head
that
was
like
a
moon
and
the
little
waves
passed
between
their
legs
climbing
up
their
legs
irresistibly
and
raoul
and
the
persian
could
no
longer
restrain
their
cries
of
horror
dismay
and
pain
nor
could
they
continue
to
hold
their
hands
at
the
level
of
their
eyes
their
hands
went
down
to
their
legs
to
push
back
the
waves
which
were
full
of
little
legs
and
nails
and
claws
and
teeth
yes
raoul
and
the
persian
were
ready
to
faint
like
pampin
the
fireman
but
the
head
of
fire
turned
round
in
answer
to
their
cries
and
spoke
to
them
do
move
do
move
whatever
you
do
do
come
after
me
i
am
the
let
me
pass
with
my
rats
and
the
head
of
fire
disappeared
vanished
in
the
darkness
while
the
passage
in
front
of
it
lit
up
as
the
result
of
the
change
which
the
had
made
in
his
dark
lantern
before
so
as
not
to
scare
the
rats
in
front
of
him
he
had
turned
his
dark
lantern
on
himself
lighting
up
his
own
head
now
to
hasten
their
flight
he
lit
the
dark
space
in
front
of
him
and
he
jumped
along
dragging
with
him
the
waves
of
scratching
rats
all
the
thousand
sounds
raoul
and
the
persian
breathed
again
though
still
trembling
i
ought
to
have
remembered
that
erik
talked
to
me
about
the
said
the
persian
but
he
never
told
me
that
he
looked
like
that
and
it
funny
that
i
should
never
have
met
him
before
of
course
erik
never
comes
to
this
part

are
we
very
far
from
the
lake
sir
asked
raoul
when
shall
we
get
there
take
me
to
the
lake
oh
take
me
to
the
lake
when
we
are
at
the
lake
we
will
call
out
christine
will
hear
us
and
he
will
hear
us
too
and
as
you
know
him
we
shall
talk
to
him
baby
said
the
persian
we
shall
never
enter
the
house
on
the
lake
by
the
lake
i
myself
have
never
landed
on
the
other
bank
the
bank
on
which
the
house
stands
you
have
to
cross
the
lake
first
and
it
is
well
guarded
i
fear
that
more
than
one
of
those
men
old
old
who
have
never
been
seen
again
were
simply
tempted
to
cross
the
lake
it
is
terrible
i
myself
would
have
been
nearly
killed
there
if
the
monster
had
not
recognized
me
in
time
one
piece
of
advice
sir
never
go
near
the
lake
and
above
all
shut
your
ears
if
you
hear
the
voice
singing
under
the
water
the
siren
voice
but
then
what
are
we
here
for
asked
raoul
in
a
transport
of
fever
impatience
and
rage
if
you
can
do
nothing
for
christine
at
least
let
me
die
for
her
the
persian
tried
to
calm
the
young
man
we
have
only
one
means
of
saving
christine
daae
believe
me
which
is
to
enter
the
house
unperceived
by
the
monster
and
is
there
any
hope
of
that
sir
ah
if
i
had
not
that
hope
i
would
not
have
come
to
fetch
you
and
how
can
one
enter
the
house
on
the
lake
without
crossing
the
lake
from
the
third
cellar
from
which
we
were
so
unluckily
driven
away
we
will
go
back
there
now
i
will
tell
you
said
the
persian
with
a
sudden
change
in
his
voice
i
will
tell
you
the
exact
place
sir
it
is
between
a
set
piece
and
a
discarded
scene
from
roi
de
lahore
exactly
at
the
spot
where
joseph
buquet
died
come
sir
take
courage
and
follow
me
and
hold
your
hand
at
the
level
of
your
eyes
but
where
are
we
the
persian
lit
his
lamp
again
and
flung
its
rays
down
two
enormous
corridors
that
crossed
each
other
at
right
angles
we
must
be
he
said
in
the
part
used
more
particularly
for
the
waterworks
i
see
no
fire
coming
from
the
furnaces
he
went
in
front
of
raoul
seeking
his
road
stopping
abruptly
when
he
was
afraid
of
meeting
some
waterman
then
they
had
to
protect
themselves
against
the
glow
of
a
sort
of
underground
forge
which
the
men
were
extinguishing
and
at
which
raoul
recognized
the
demons
whom
christine
had
seen
at
the
time
of
her
first
captivity
in
this
way
they
gradually
arrived
beneath
the
huge
cellars
below
the
stage
they
must
at
this
time
have
been
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
tub
and
at
an
extremely
great
depth
when
we
remember
that
the
earth
was
dug
out
at
fifty
feet
below
the
water
that
lay
under
the
whole
of
that
part
of
paris
the
persian
touched
a
and
said
if
i
am
not
mistaken
this
is
a
wall
that
might
easily
belong
to
the
house
on
the
lake
he
was
striking
a
of
the
tub
and
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
for
the
reader
to
know
how
the
bottom
and
the
of
the
tub
were
built
in
order
to
prevent
the
water
surrounding
the
from
remaining
in
immediate
contact
with
the
walls
supporting
the
whole
of
the
theatrical
machinery
the
architect
was
obliged
to
build
a
double
case
in
every
direction
the
work
of
constructing
this
double
case
took
a
whole
year
it
was
the
wall
of
the
first
inner
case
that
the
persian
struck
when
speaking
to
raoul
of
the
house
on
the
lake
to
any
one
understanding
the
architecture
of
the
edifice
the
persian
action
would
seem
to
indicate
that
mysterious
house
had
been
built
in
the
double
case
formed
of
a
thick
wall
constructed
as
an
embankment
or
dam
then
of
a
brick
wall
a
tremendous
layer
of
cement
and
another
wall
several
yards
in
thickness
at
the
persian
words
raoul
flung
himself
against
the
wall
and
listened
eagerly
but
he
heard
nothing
nothing
except
distant
steps
sounding
on
the
floor
of
the
upper
portions
of
the
theater
the
persian
darkened
his
lantern
again
look
out
he
said
keep
your
hand
up
and
silence
for
we
shall
try
another
way
of
getting
in
and
he
led
him
to
the
little
staircase
by
which
they
had
come
down
lately
they
went
up
stopping
at
each
step
peering
into
the
darkness
and
the
silence
till
they
came
to
the
third
cellar
here
the
persian
motioned
to
raoul
to
go
on
his
knees
and
in
this
way
crawling
on
both
knees
and
one
hand
for
the
other
hand
was
held
in
the
position
indicated
they
reached
the
end
wall
against
this
wall
stood
a
large
discarded
scene
from
the
roi
de
lahore
close
to
this
scene
was
a
set
piece
between
the
scene
and
the
set
piece
there
was
just
room
for
a
body
for
a
body
which
one
day
was
found
hanging
there
the
body
of
joseph
buquet
the
persian
still
kneeling
stopped
and
listened
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
hesitate
and
looked
at
raoul
then
he
turned
his
eyes
upward
toward
the
second
cellar
which
sent
down
the
faint
glimmer
of
a
lantern
through
a
cranny
between
two
boards
this
glimmer
seemed
to
trouble
the
persian
at
last
he
tossed
his
head
and
made
up
his
mind
to
act
he
slipped
between
the
set
piece
and
the
scene
from
the
roi
de
lahore
with
raoul
close
upon
his
heels
with
his
free
hand
the
persian
felt
the
wall
raoul
saw
him
bear
heavily
upon
the
wall
just
as
he
had
pressed
against
the
wall
in
christine
then
a
stone
gave
way
leaving
a
hole
in
the
wall
this
time
the
persian
took
his
pistol
from
his
pocket
and
made
a
sign
to
raoul
to
do
as
he
did
he
cocked
the
pistol
and
resolutely
still
on
his
knees
he
wiggled
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
raoul
who
had
wished
to
pass
first
had
to
be
content
to
follow
him
the
hole
was
very
narrow
the
persian
stopped
almost
at
once
raoul
heard
him
feeling
the
stones
around
him
then
the
persian
took
out
his
dark
lantern
again
stooped
forward
examined
something
beneath
him
and
immediately
extinguished
his
lantern
raoul
heard
him
say
in
a
whisper
we
shall
have
to
drop
a
few
yards
without
making
a
noise
take
off
your
boots
the
persian
handed
his
own
shoes
to
raoul
put
them
outside
the
wall
he
said
we
shall
find
them
there
when
we
leave
he
crawled
a
little
farther
on
his
knees
then
turned
right
round
and
said
i
am
going
to
hang
by
my
hands
from
the
edge
of
the
stone
and
let
myself
drop
into
his
house
you
must
do
exactly
the
same
do
not
be
afraid
i
will
catch
you
in
my
arms
raoul
soon
heard
a
dull
sound
evidently
produced
by
the
fall
of
the
persian
and
then
dropped
down
he
felt
himself
clasped
in
the
persian
arms
hush
said
the
persian
and
they
stood
motionless
listening
the
darkness
was
thick
around
them
the
silence
heavy
and
terrible
then
the
persian
began
to
make
play
with
the
dark
lantern
again
turning
the
rays
over
their
heads
looking
for
the
hole
through
which
they
had
come
and
failing
to
find
it
oh
he
said
the
stone
has
closed
of
itself
and
the
light
of
the
lantern
swept
down
the
wall
and
over
the
floor
the
persian
stooped
and
picked
up
something
a
sort
of
cord
which
he
examined
for
a
second
and
flung
away
with
horror
the
punjab
lasso
he
muttered
what
is
it
asked
raoul
the
persian
shivered
it
might
very
well
be
the
rope
by
which
the
man
was
hanged
and
which
was
looked
for
so
long
and
suddenly
seized
with
fresh
anxiety
he
moved
the
little
red
disk
of
his
lantern
over
the
walls
in
this
way
he
lit
up
a
curious
thing
the
trunk
of
a
tree
which
seemed
still
quite
alive
with
its
leaves
and
the
branches
of
that
tree
ran
right
up
the
walls
and
disappeared
in
the
ceiling
because
of
the
smallness
of
the
luminous
disk
it
was
difficult
at
first
to
make
out
the
appearance
of
things
they
saw
a
corner
of
a
branch
and
a
leaf
and
another
leaf
and
next
to
it
nothing
at
all
nothing
but
the
ray
of
light
that
seemed
to
reflect
itself
raoul
passed
his
hand
over
that
nothing
over
that
reflection
hullo
he
said
the
wall
is
a
yes
a
said
the
persian
in
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
and
passing
the
hand
that
held
the
pistol
over
his
moist
forehead
he
added
we
have
dropped
into
the
what
the
persian
knew
of
this
and
what
there
befell
him
and
his
companion
shall
be
told
in
his
own
words
as
set
down
in
a
manuscript
which
he
left
behind
him
and
which
i
copy
verbatim
pedro
gailhard
has
himself
told
me
that
he
created
a
few
additional
posts
as
for
old
whom
he
was
unwilling
to
dismiss
from
the
service
of
the
opera
in
those
days
it
was
still
part
of
the
firemen
duty
to
watch
over
the
safety
of
the
opera
house
outside
the
performances
but
this
service
has
since
been
suppressed
i
asked
pedro
gailhard
the
reason
and
he
replied
it
was
because
the
management
was
afraid
that
in
their
utter
inexperience
of
the
cellars
of
the
opera
the
firemen
might
set
fire
to
the
building
like
the
persian
i
can
give
no
further
explanation
touching
the
apparition
of
this
shade
whereas
in
this
historic
narrative
everything
else
will
be
normally
explained
however
abnormal
the
course
of
events
may
seem
i
can
not
give
the
reader
expressly
to
understand
what
the
persian
meant
by
the
words
it
is
some
one
much
worse
than
that
the
reader
must
try
to
guess
for
himself
for
i
promised
pedro
gailhard
the
former
manager
of
the
opera
to
keep
his
secret
regarding
the
extremely
interesting
and
useful
personality
of
the
wandering
cloaked
shade
which
while
condemning
itself
to
live
in
the
cellars
of
the
opera
rendered
such
immense
services
to
those
who
on
gala
evenings
for
instance
venture
to
stray
away
from
the
stage
i
am
speaking
of
state
services
and
upon
my
word
of
honor
i
can
say
no
more
all
the
water
had
to
be
exhausted
in
the
building
of
the
opera
to
give
an
idea
of
the
amount
of
water
that
was
pumped
up
i
can
tell
the
reader
that
it
represented
the
area
of
the
courtyard
of
the
louvre
and
a
height
half
as
deep
again
as
the
towers
of
notre
dame
and
nevertheless
the
engineers
had
to
leave
a
lake
these
two
pairs
of
boots
which
were
placed
according
to
the
persian
papers
just
between
the
set
piece
and
the
scene
from
the
roi
de
lahore
on
the
spot
where
joseph
buquet
was
found
hanging
were
never
discovered
they
must
have
been
taken
by
some
or
chapter
xxi
interesting
and
instructive
vicissitudes
of
a
persian
in
the
cellars
of
the
opera
the
persian
narrative
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
entered
the
house
on
the
lake
i
had
often
begged
the
lover
as
we
used
to
call
erik
in
my
country
to
open
its
mysterious
doors
to
me
he
always
refused
i
made
very
many
attempts
but
in
vain
to
obtain
admittance
watch
him
as
i
might
after
i
first
learned
that
he
had
taken
up
his
permanent
abode
at
the
opera
the
darkness
was
always
too
thick
to
enable
me
to
see
how
he
worked
the
door
in
the
wall
on
the
lake
one
day
when
i
thought
myself
alone
i
stepped
into
the
boat
and
rowed
toward
that
part
of
the
wall
through
which
i
had
seen
erik
disappear
it
was
then
that
i
came
into
contact
with
the
siren
who
guarded
the
approach
and
whose
charm
was
very
nearly
fatal
to
me
i
had
no
sooner
put
off
from
the
bank
than
the
silence
amid
which
i
floated
on
the
water
was
disturbed
by
a
sort
of
whispered
singing
that
hovered
all
around
me
it
was
half
breath
half
music
it
rose
softly
from
the
waters
of
the
lake
and
i
was
surrounded
by
it
through
i
knew
not
what
artifice
it
followed
me
moved
with
me
and
was
so
soft
that
it
did
not
alarm
me
on
the
contrary
in
my
longing
to
approach
the
source
of
that
sweet
and
enticing
harmony
i
leaned
out
of
my
little
boat
over
the
water
for
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
the
singing
came
from
the
water
itself
by
this
time
i
was
alone
in
the
boat
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
the
voice
for
it
was
now
distinctly
a
voice
was
beside
me
on
the
water
i
leaned
over
leaned
still
farther
the
lake
was
perfectly
calm
and
a
moonbeam
that
passed
through
the
air
hole
in
the
rue
scribe
showed
me
absolutely
nothing
on
its
surface
which
was
smooth
and
black
as
ink
i
shook
my
ears
to
get
rid
of
a
possible
humming
but
i
soon
had
to
accept
the
fact
that
there
was
no
humming
in
the
ears
so
harmonious
as
the
singing
whisper
that
followed
and
now
attracted
me
had
i
been
inclined
to
superstition
i
should
have
certainly
thought
that
i
had
to
do
with
some
siren
whose
business
it
was
to
confound
the
traveler
who
should
venture
on
the
waters
of
the
house
on
the
lake
fortunately
i
come
from
a
country
where
we
are
too
fond
of
fantastic
things
not
to
know
them
through
and
through
and
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
i
was
face
to
face
with
some
new
invention
of
erik
but
this
invention
was
so
perfect
that
as
i
leaned
out
of
the
boat
i
was
impelled
less
by
a
desire
to
discover
its
trick
than
to
enjoy
its
charm
and
i
leaned
out
leaned
out
until
i
almost
overturned
the
boat
suddenly
two
monstrous
arms
issued
from
the
bosom
of
the
waters
and
seized
me
by
the
neck
dragging
me
down
to
the
depths
with
irresistible
force
i
should
certainly
have
been
lost
if
i
had
not
had
time
to
give
a
cry
by
which
erik
knew
me
for
it
was
he
and
instead
of
drowning
me
as
was
certainly
his
first
intention
he
swam
with
me
and
laid
me
gently
on
the
bank
how
imprudent
you
are
he
said
as
he
stood
before
me
dripping
with
water
why
try
to
enter
my
house
i
never
invited
you
i
do
want
you
there
nor
anybody
did
you
save
my
life
only
to
make
it
unbearable
to
me
however
great
the
service
you
rendered
him
erik
may
end
by
forgetting
it
and
you
know
that
nothing
can
restrain
erik
not
even
erik
himself
he
spoke
but
i
had
now
no
other
wish
than
to
know
what
i
already
called
the
trick
of
the
siren
he
satisfied
my
curiosity
for
erik
who
is
a
real
monster
i
have
seen
him
at
work
in
persia
alas
is
also
in
certain
respects
a
regular
child
vain
and
and
there
is
nothing
he
loves
so
much
after
astonishing
people
as
to
prove
all
the
really
miraculous
ingenuity
of
his
mind
he
laughed
and
showed
me
a
long
reed
it
the
silliest
trick
you
ever
saw
he
said
but
it
very
useful
for
breathing
and
singing
in
the
water
i
learned
it
from
the
tonkin
pirates
who
are
able
to
remain
hidden
for
hours
in
the
beds
of
the
rivers
i
spoke
to
him
severely
it
a
trick
that
nearly
killed
me
i
said
and
it
may
have
been
fatal
to
others
you
know
what
you
promised
me
erik
no
more
murders
have
i
really
committed
murders
he
asked
putting
on
his
most
amiable
air
wretched
man
i
cried
have
you
forgotten
the
rosy
hours
of
mazenderan
yes
he
replied
in
a
sadder
tone
i
prefer
to
forget
them
i
used
to
make
the
little
sultana
laugh
though
all
that
belongs
to
the
past
i
declared
but
there
is
the
present
and
you
are
responsible
to
me
for
the
present
because
if
i
had
wished
there
would
have
been
none
at
all
for
you
remember
that
erik
i
saved
your
life
and
i
took
advantage
of
the
turn
of
conversation
to
speak
to
him
of
something
that
had
long
been
on
my
mind
erik
i
asked
erik
swear
that
what
he
retorted
you
know
i
never
keep
my
oaths
oaths
are
made
to
catch
gulls
with
tell
me
you
can
tell
me
at
any
rate
well
well
the
chandelier
the
chandelier
erik
what
about
the
chandelier
you
know
what
i
mean
oh
he
sniggered
i
do
mind
telling
you
about
the
chandelier
it
was
i
the
chandelier
was
very
old
and
worn
when
erik
laughed
he
was
more
terrible
than
ever
he
jumped
into
the
boat
chuckling
so
horribly
that
i
could
not
help
trembling
very
old
and
worn
my
dear
daroga
very
old
and
worn
the
chandelier
it
fell
of
itself
it
came
down
with
a
smash
and
now
daroga
take
my
advice
and
go
and
dry
yourself
or
catch
a
cold
in
the
head
and
never
get
into
my
boat
again
and
whatever
you
do
do
try
to
enter
my
house
i
not
always
there
daroga
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
have
to
dedicate
my
requiem
mass
to
you
so
saying
swinging
to
and
fro
like
a
monkey
and
still
chuckling
he
pushed
off
and
soon
disappeared
in
the
darkness
of
the
lake
from
that
day
i
gave
up
all
thought
of
penetrating
into
his
house
by
the
lake
that
entrance
was
obviously
too
well
guarded
especially
since
he
had
learned
that
i
knew
about
it
but
i
felt
that
there
must
be
another
entrance
for
i
had
often
seen
erik
disappear
in
the
third
cellar
when
i
was
watching
him
though
i
could
not
imagine
how
ever
since
i
had
discovered
erik
installed
in
the
opera
i
lived
in
a
perpetual
terror
of
his
horrible
fancies
not
in
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
but
i
dreaded
everything
for
others
and
whenever
some
accident
some
fatal
event
happened
i
always
thought
to
myself
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
that
were
erik
even
as
others
used
to
say
it
the
ghost
how
often
have
i
not
heard
people
utter
that
phrase
with
a
smile
poor
devils
if
they
had
known
that
the
ghost
existed
in
the
flesh
i
swear
they
would
not
have
laughed
although
erik
announced
to
me
very
solemnly
that
he
had
changed
and
that
he
had
become
the
most
virtuous
of
men
since
he
was
loved
for
himself
a
sentence
that
at
first
perplexed
me
most
terribly
i
could
not
help
shuddering
when
i
thought
of
the
monster
his
horrible
unparalleled
and
repulsive
ugliness
put
him
without
the
pale
of
humanity
and
it
often
seemed
to
me
that
for
this
reason
he
no
longer
believed
that
he
had
any
duty
toward
the
human
race
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
of
his
love
affairs
only
increased
my
alarm
for
i
foresaw
the
cause
of
fresh
and
more
hideous
tragedies
in
this
event
to
which
he
alluded
so
boastfully
on
the
other
hand
i
soon
discovered
the
curious
moral
traffic
established
between
the
monster
and
christine
daae
hiding
in
the
next
to
the
young
prima
donna
i
listened
to
wonderful
musical
displays
that
evidently
flung
christine
into
marvelous
ecstasy
but
all
the
same
i
would
never
have
thought
that
erik
voice
which
was
loud
as
thunder
or
soft
as
angels
voices
at
will
could
have
made
her
forget
his
ugliness
i
understood
all
when
i
learned
that
christine
had
not
yet
seen
him
i
had
occasion
to
go
to
the
and
remembering
the
lessons
he
had
once
given
me
i
had
no
difficulty
in
discovering
the
trick
that
made
the
wall
with
the
mirror
swing
round
and
i
ascertained
the
means
of
hollow
bricks
and
so
on
by
which
he
made
his
voice
carry
to
christine
as
though
she
heard
it
close
beside
her
in
this
way
also
i
discovered
the
road
that
led
to
the
well
and
the
dungeon
the
communists
dungeon
and
also
the
that
enabled
erik
to
go
straight
to
the
cellars
below
the
stage
a
few
days
later
what
was
not
my
amazement
to
learn
by
my
own
eyes
and
ears
that
erik
and
christine
daae
saw
each
other
and
to
catch
the
monster
stooping
over
the
little
well
in
the
communists
road
and
sprinkling
the
forehead
of
christine
daae
who
had
fainted
a
white
horse
the
horse
out
of
the
profeta
which
had
disappeared
from
the
stables
under
the
opera
was
standing
quietly
beside
them
i
showed
myself
it
was
terrible
i
saw
sparks
fly
from
those
yellow
eyes
and
before
i
had
time
to
say
a
word
i
received
a
blow
on
the
head
that
stunned
me
when
i
came
to
myself
erik
christine
and
the
white
horse
had
disappeared
i
felt
sure
that
the
poor
girl
was
a
prisoner
in
the
house
on
the
lake
without
hesitation
i
resolved
to
return
to
the
bank
notwithstanding
the
attendant
danger
for
hours
i
lay
in
wait
for
the
monster
to
appear
for
i
felt
that
he
must
go
out
driven
by
the
need
of
obtaining
provisions
and
in
this
connection
i
may
say
that
when
he
went
out
in
the
streets
or
ventured
to
show
himself
in
public
he
wore
a
pasteboard
nose
with
a
mustache
attached
to
it
instead
of
his
own
horrible
hole
of
a
nose
this
did
not
quite
take
away
his
air
but
it
made
him
almost
i
say
almost
endurable
to
look
at
i
therefore
watched
on
the
bank
of
the
lake
and
weary
of
long
waiting
was
beginning
to
think
that
he
had
gone
through
the
other
door
the
door
in
the
third
cellar
when
i
heard
a
slight
splashing
in
the
dark
i
saw
the
two
yellow
eyes
shining
like
candles
and
soon
the
boat
touched
shore
erik
jumped
out
and
walked
up
to
me
you
been
here
for
hours
he
said
and
you
annoying
me
i
tell
you
all
this
will
end
very
badly
and
you
will
have
brought
it
upon
yourself
for
i
have
been
extraordinarily
patient
with
you
you
think
you
are
following
me
you
great
booby
whereas
it
i
who
am
following
you
and
i
know
all
that
you
know
about
me
here
i
spared
you
yesterday
in
my
communists
road
but
i
warn
you
seriously
do
let
me
catch
you
there
again
upon
my
word
you
seem
able
to
take
a
hint
he
was
so
furious
that
i
did
not
think
for
the
moment
of
interrupting
him
after
puffing
and
blowing
like
a
walrus
he
put
his
horrible
thought
into
words
yes
you
must
learn
once
and
for
all
once
and
for
all
i
say
to
take
a
hint
i
tell
you
that
with
your
recklessness
for
you
have
already
been
twice
arrested
by
the
shade
in
the
felt
hat
who
did
not
know
what
you
were
doing
in
the
cellars
and
took
you
to
the
managers
who
looked
upon
you
as
an
eccentric
persian
interested
in
stage
mechanism
and
life
behind
the
scenes
i
know
all
about
it
i
was
there
in
the
office
you
know
i
am
everywhere
well
i
tell
you
that
with
your
recklessness
they
will
end
by
wondering
what
you
are
after
here
and
they
will
end
by
knowing
that
you
are
after
erik
and
then
they
will
be
after
erik
themselves
and
they
will
discover
the
house
on
the
lake
if
they
do
it
will
be
a
bad
lookout
for
you
old
chap
a
bad
lookout
i
wo
answer
for
anything
again
he
puffed
and
blew
like
a
walrus
i
wo
answer
for
anything
if
erik
secrets
cease
to
be
secrets
it
will
be
a
bad
lookout
for
a
goodly
number
of
the
human
race
that
all
i
have
to
tell
you
and
unless
you
are
a
great
booby
it
ought
to
be
enough
for
you
except
that
you
do
know
how
to
take
a
hint
he
had
sat
down
on
the
stern
of
his
boat
and
was
kicking
his
heels
against
the
planks
waiting
to
hear
what
i
had
to
answer
i
simply
said
it
not
erik
that
i
after
here
who
then
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
it
christine
daae
i
answered
he
retorted
i
have
every
right
to
see
her
in
my
own
house
i
am
loved
for
my
own
sake
that
not
true
i
said
you
have
carried
her
off
and
are
keeping
her
locked
up
listen
he
said
will
you
promise
never
to
meddle
with
my
affairs
again
if
i
prove
to
you
that
i
am
loved
for
my
own
sake
yes
i
promise
you
i
replied
without
hesitation
for
i
felt
convinced
that
for
such
a
monster
the
proof
was
impossible
well
then
it
quite
simple
christine
daae
shall
leave
this
as
she
pleases
and
come
back
again
yes
come
back
again
because
she
wishes
come
back
of
herself
because
she
loves
me
for
myself
oh
i
doubt
if
she
will
come
back
but
it
is
your
duty
to
let
her
go
my
duty
you
great
booby
it
is
my
wish
my
wish
to
let
her
go
and
she
will
come
back
again
for
she
loves
me
all
this
will
end
in
a
marriage
a
marriage
at
the
madeleine
you
great
booby
do
you
believe
me
now
when
i
tell
you
that
my
nuptial
mass
is
written
wait
till
you
hear
the
kyrie
he
beat
time
with
his
heels
on
the
planks
of
the
boat
and
sang
kyrie
kyrie
kyrie
eleison
wait
till
you
hear
wait
till
you
hear
that
mass
look
here
i
said
i
shall
believe
you
if
i
see
christine
daae
come
out
of
the
house
on
the
lake
and
go
back
to
it
of
her
own
accord
and
you
wo
meddle
any
more
in
my
affairs
no
very
well
you
shall
see
that
come
to
the
masked
ball
christine
and
i
will
go
and
have
a
look
round
then
you
can
hide
in
the
and
you
shall
see
christine
who
will
have
gone
to
her
delighted
to
come
back
by
the
communists
road
and
now
be
off
for
i
must
go
and
do
some
shopping
to
my
intense
astonishment
things
happened
as
he
had
announced
christine
daae
left
the
house
on
the
lake
and
returned
to
it
several
times
without
apparently
being
forced
to
do
so
it
was
very
difficult
for
me
to
clear
my
mind
of
erik
however
i
resolved
to
be
extremely
prudent
and
did
not
make
the
mistake
of
returning
to
the
shore
of
the
lake
or
of
going
by
the
communists
road
but
the
idea
of
the
secret
entrance
in
the
third
cellar
haunted
me
and
i
repeatedly
went
and
waited
for
hours
behind
a
scene
from
the
roi
de
lahore
which
had
been
left
there
for
some
reason
or
other
at
last
my
patience
was
rewarded
one
day
i
saw
the
monster
come
toward
me
on
his
knees
i
was
certain
that
he
could
not
see
me
he
passed
between
the
scene
behind
which
i
stood
and
a
set
piece
went
to
the
wall
and
pressed
on
a
spring
that
moved
a
stone
and
afforded
him
an
ingress
he
passed
through
this
and
the
stone
closed
behind
him
i
waited
for
at
least
thirty
minutes
and
then
pressed
the
spring
in
my
turn
everything
happened
as
with
erik
but
i
was
careful
not
to
go
through
the
hole
myself
for
i
knew
that
erik
was
inside
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
that
i
might
be
caught
by
erik
suddenly
made
me
think
of
the
death
of
joseph
buquet
i
did
not
wish
to
jeopardize
the
advantages
of
so
great
a
discovery
which
might
be
useful
to
many
people
to
a
goodly
number
of
the
human
race
in
erik
words
and
i
left
the
cellars
of
the
opera
after
carefully
replacing
the
stone
i
continued
to
be
greatly
interested
in
the
relations
between
erik
and
christine
daae
not
from
any
morbid
curiosity
but
because
of
the
terrible
thought
which
obsessed
my
mind
that
erik
was
capable
of
anything
if
he
once
discovered
that
he
was
not
loved
for
his
own
sake
as
he
imagined
i
continued
to
wander
very
cautiously
about
the
opera
and
soon
learned
the
truth
about
the
monster
dreary
he
filled
christine
mind
through
the
terror
with
which
he
inspired
her
but
the
dear
child
heart
belonged
wholly
to
the
vicomte
raoul
de
chagny
while
they
played
about
like
an
innocent
engaged
couple
on
the
upper
floors
of
the
opera
to
avoid
the
monster
they
little
suspected
that
some
one
was
watching
over
them
i
was
prepared
to
do
anything
to
kill
the
monster
if
necessary
and
explain
to
the
police
afterward
but
erik
did
not
show
himself
and
i
felt
none
the
more
comfortable
for
that
i
must
explain
my
whole
plan
i
thought
that
the
monster
being
driven
from
his
house
by
jealousy
would
thus
enable
me
to
enter
it
without
danger
through
the
passage
in
the
third
cellar
it
was
important
for
everybody
sake
that
i
should
know
exactly
what
was
inside
one
day
tired
of
waiting
for
an
opportunity
i
moved
the
stone
and
at
once
heard
an
astounding
music
the
monster
was
working
at
his
don
juan
triumphant
with
every
door
in
his
house
wide
open
i
knew
that
this
was
the
work
of
his
life
i
was
careful
not
to
stir
and
remained
prudently
in
my
dark
hole
he
stopped
playing
for
a
moment
and
began
walking
about
his
place
like
a
madman
and
he
said
aloud
at
the
top
of
his
voice
it
must
be
finished
first
quite
finished
this
speech
was
not
calculated
to
reassure
me
and
when
the
music
recommenced
i
closed
the
stone
very
softly
on
the
day
of
the
abduction
of
christine
daae
i
did
not
come
to
the
theater
until
rather
late
in
the
evening
trembling
lest
i
should
hear
bad
news
i
had
spent
a
horrible
day
for
after
reading
in
a
morning
paper
the
announcement
of
a
forthcoming
marriage
between
christine
and
the
vicomte
de
chagny
i
wondered
whether
after
all
i
should
not
do
better
to
denounce
the
monster
but
reason
returned
to
me
and
i
was
persuaded
that
this
action
could
only
precipitate
a
possible
catastrophe
when
my
cab
set
me
down
before
the
opera
i
was
really
almost
astonished
to
see
it
still
standing
but
i
am
something
of
a
fatalist
like
all
good
orientals
and
i
entered
ready
for
anything
christine
daae
abduction
in
the
prison
act
which
naturally
surprised
everybody
found
me
prepared
i
was
quite
certain
that
she
had
been
juggled
away
by
erik
that
prince
of
conjurers
and
i
thought
positively
that
this
was
the
end
of
christine
and
perhaps
of
everybody
so
much
so
that
i
thought
of
advising
all
these
people
who
were
staying
on
at
the
theater
to
make
good
their
escape
i
felt
however
that
they
would
be
sure
to
look
upon
me
as
mad
and
i
refrained
on
the
other
hand
i
resolved
to
act
without
further
delay
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
the
chances
were
in
my
favor
that
erik
at
that
moment
was
thinking
only
of
his
captive
this
was
the
moment
to
enter
his
house
through
the
third
cellar
and
i
resolved
to
take
with
me
that
poor
little
desperate
viscount
who
at
the
first
suggestion
accepted
with
an
amount
of
confidence
in
myself
that
touched
me
profoundly
i
had
sent
my
servant
for
my
pistols
i
gave
one
to
the
viscount
and
advised
him
to
hold
himself
ready
to
fire
for
after
all
erik
might
be
waiting
for
us
behind
the
wall
we
were
to
go
by
the
road
and
through
the
seeing
my
pistols
the
little
viscount
asked
me
if
we
were
going
to
fight
a
duel
i
said
yes
and
what
a
duel
but
of
course
i
had
no
time
to
explain
anything
to
him
the
little
viscount
is
a
brave
fellow
but
he
knew
hardly
anything
about
his
adversary
and
it
was
so
much
the
better
my
great
fear
was
that
he
was
already
somewhere
near
us
preparing
the
punjab
lasso
no
one
knows
better
than
he
how
to
throw
the
punjab
lasso
for
he
is
the
king
of
stranglers
even
as
he
is
the
prince
of
conjurors
when
he
had
finished
making
the
little
sultana
laugh
at
the
time
of
the
rosy
hours
of
mazenderan
she
herself
used
to
ask
him
to
amuse
her
by
giving
her
a
thrill
it
was
then
that
he
introduced
the
sport
of
the
punjab
lasso
he
had
lived
in
india
and
acquired
an
incredible
skill
in
the
art
of
strangulation
he
would
make
them
lock
him
into
a
courtyard
to
which
they
brought
a
warrior
usually
a
man
condemned
to
death
armed
with
a
long
pike
and
broadsword
erik
had
only
his
lasso
and
it
was
always
just
when
the
warrior
thought
that
he
was
going
to
fell
erik
with
a
tremendous
blow
that
we
heard
the
lasso
whistle
through
the
air
with
a
turn
of
the
wrist
erik
tightened
the
noose
round
his
neck
and
in
this
fashion
dragged
him
before
the
little
sultana
and
her
women
who
sat
looking
from
a
window
and
applauding
the
little
sultana
herself
learned
to
wield
the
punjab
lasso
and
killed
several
of
her
women
and
even
of
the
friends
who
visited
her
but
i
prefer
to
drop
this
terrible
subject
of
the
rosy
hours
of
mazenderan
i
have
mentioned
it
only
to
explain
why
on
arriving
with
the
vicomte
de
chagny
in
the
cellars
of
the
opera
i
was
bound
to
protect
my
companion
against
the
danger
of
death
by
strangling
my
pistols
could
serve
no
purpose
for
erik
was
not
likely
to
show
himself
but
erik
could
always
strangle
us
i
had
no
time
to
explain
all
this
to
the
viscount
besides
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
complicating
the
position
i
simply
told
de
chagny
to
keep
his
hand
at
the
level
of
his
eyes
with
the
arm
bent
as
though
waiting
for
the
command
to
fire
with
his
victim
in
this
attitude
it
is
impossible
even
for
the
most
expert
strangler
to
throw
the
lasso
with
advantage
it
catches
you
not
only
round
the
neck
but
also
round
the
arm
or
hand
this
enables
you
easily
to
unloose
the
lasso
which
then
becomes
harmless
after
avoiding
the
commissary
of
police
a
number
of
and
the
firemen
after
meeting
the
and
passing
the
man
in
the
felt
hat
unperceived
the
viscount
and
i
arrived
without
obstacle
in
the
third
cellar
between
the
set
piece
and
the
scene
from
the
roi
de
lahore
i
worked
the
stone
and
we
jumped
into
the
house
which
erik
had
built
himself
in
the
double
case
of
the
of
the
opera
and
this
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
him
to
do
because
erik
was
one
of
the
chief
contractors
under
philippe
garnier
the
architect
of
the
opera
and
continued
to
work
by
himself
when
the
works
were
officially
suspended
during
the
war
the
siege
of
paris
and
the
commune
i
knew
my
erik
too
well
to
feel
at
all
comfortable
on
jumping
into
his
house
i
knew
what
he
had
made
of
a
certain
palace
at
mazenderan
from
being
the
most
honest
building
conceivable
he
soon
turned
it
into
a
house
of
the
very
devil
where
you
could
not
utter
a
word
but
it
was
overheard
or
repeated
by
an
echo
with
his
the
monster
was
responsible
for
endless
tragedies
of
all
kinds
he
hit
upon
astonishing
inventions
of
these
the
most
curious
horrible
and
dangerous
was
the
except
in
special
cases
when
the
little
sultana
amused
herself
by
inflicting
suffering
upon
some
unoffending
citizen
no
one
was
let
into
it
but
wretches
condemned
to
death
and
even
then
when
these
had
had
enough
they
were
always
at
liberty
to
put
an
end
to
themselves
with
a
punjab
lasso
or
bowstring
left
for
their
use
at
the
foot
of
an
iron
tree
my
alarm
therefore
was
great
when
i
saw
that
the
room
into
which
le
vicomte
de
chagny
and
i
had
dropped
was
an
exact
copy
of
the
of
the
rosy
hours
of
mazenderan
at
our
feet
i
found
the
punjab
lasso
which
i
had
been
dreading
all
the
evening
i
was
convinced
that
this
rope
had
already
done
duty
for
joseph
buquet
who
like
myself
must
have
caught
erik
one
evening
working
the
stone
in
the
third
cellar
he
probably
tried
it
in
his
turn
fell
into
the
and
only
left
it
hanged
i
can
well
imagine
erik
dragging
the
body
in
order
to
get
rid
of
it
to
the
scene
from
the
roi
de
lahore
and
hanging
it
there
as
an
example
or
to
increase
the
superstitious
terror
that
was
to
help
him
in
guarding
the
approaches
to
his
lair
then
upon
reflection
erik
went
back
to
fetch
the
punjab
lasso
which
is
very
curiously
made
out
of
catgut
and
which
might
have
set
an
examining
magistrate
thinking
this
explains
the
disappearance
of
the
rope
and
now
i
discovered
the
lasso
at
our
feet
in
the
i
am
no
coward
but
a
cold
sweat
covered
my
forehead
as
i
moved
the
little
red
disk
of
my
lantern
over
the
walls
de
chagny
noticed
it
and
asked
what
is
the
matter
sir
i
made
him
a
violent
sign
to
be
silent
an
official
report
from
tonkin
received
in
paris
at
the
end
of
july
relates
how
the
famous
pirate
chief
de
tham
was
tracked
together
with
his
men
by
our
soldiers
and
how
all
of
them
succeeded
in
escaping
thanks
to
this
trick
of
the
reeds
daroga
is
persian
for
chief
of
police
the
persian
might
easily
have
admitted
that
erik
fate
also
interested
himself
for
he
was
well
aware
that
if
the
government
of
teheran
had
learned
that
erik
was
still
alive
it
would
have
been
all
up
with
the
modest
pension
of
the
erstwhile
daroga
it
is
only
fair
however
to
add
that
the
persian
had
a
noble
and
generous
heart
and
i
do
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
the
catastrophes
which
he
feared
for
others
greatly
occupied
his
mind
his
conduct
throughout
this
business
proves
it
and
is
above
all
praise
chapter
xxii
in
the
torture
chamber
the
persian
narrative
continued
we
were
in
the
middle
of
a
little
room
the
sides
of
which
were
covered
with
mirrors
from
top
to
bottom
in
the
corners
we
could
clearly
see
the
joins
in
the
glasses
the
segments
intended
to
turn
on
their
gear
yes
i
recognized
them
and
i
recognized
the
iron
tree
in
the
corner
at
the
bottom
of
one
of
those
segments
the
iron
tree
with
its
iron
branch
for
the
hanged
men
i
seized
my
companion
arm
the
vicomte
de
chagny
was
all
eager
to
shout
to
his
betrothed
that
he
was
bringing
her
help
i
feared
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
contain
himself
suddenly
we
heard
a
noise
on
our
left
it
sounded
at
first
like
a
door
opening
and
shutting
in
the
next
room
and
then
there
was
a
dull
moan
i
clutched
de
chagny
arm
more
firmly
still
and
then
we
distinctly
heard
these
words
you
must
make
your
choice
the
wedding
mass
or
the
requiem
mass
i
recognized
the
voice
of
the
monster
there
was
another
moan
followed
by
a
long
silence
i
was
persuaded
by
now
that
the
monster
was
unaware
of
our
presence
in
his
house
for
otherwise
he
would
certainly
have
managed
not
to
let
us
hear
him
he
would
only
have
had
to
close
the
little
invisible
window
through
which
the
look
down
into
the
besides
i
was
certain
that
if
he
had
known
of
our
presence
the
tortures
would
have
begun
at
once
the
important
thing
was
not
to
let
him
know
and
i
dreaded
nothing
so
much
as
the
impulsiveness
of
the
vicomte
de
chagny
who
wanted
to
rush
through
the
walls
to
christine
daae
whose
moans
we
continued
to
hear
at
intervals
the
requiem
mass
is
not
at
all
gay
erik
voice
resumed
whereas
the
wedding
mass
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
is
magnificent
you
must
take
a
resolution
and
know
your
own
mind
i
ca
go
on
living
like
this
like
a
mole
in
a
burrow
don
juan
triumphant
is
finished
and
now
i
want
to
live
like
everybody
else
i
want
to
have
a
wife
like
everybody
else
and
to
take
her
out
on
sundays
i
have
invented
a
mask
that
makes
me
look
like
anybody
people
will
not
even
turn
round
in
the
streets
you
will
be
the
happiest
of
women
and
we
will
sing
all
by
ourselves
till
we
swoon
away
with
delight
you
are
crying
you
are
afraid
of
me
and
yet
i
am
not
really
wicked
love
me
and
you
shall
see
all
i
wanted
was
to
be
loved
for
myself
if
you
loved
me
i
should
be
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
you
could
do
anything
with
me
that
you
pleased
soon
the
moans
that
accompanied
this
sort
of
love
litany
increased
and
increased
i
have
never
heard
anything
more
despairing
and
de
chagny
and
i
recognized
that
this
terrible
lamentation
came
from
erik
himself
christine
seemed
to
be
standing
dumb
with
horror
without
the
strength
to
cry
out
while
the
monster
was
on
his
knees
before
her
three
times
over
erik
fiercely
bewailed
his
fate
you
do
love
me
you
do
love
me
you
do
love
me
and
then
more
gently
why
do
you
cry
you
know
it
gives
me
pain
to
see
you
cry
a
silence
each
silence
gave
us
fresh
hope
we
said
to
ourselves
perhaps
he
has
left
christine
behind
the
wall
and
we
thought
only
of
the
possibility
of
warning
christine
daae
of
our
presence
unknown
to
the
monster
we
were
unable
to
leave
the
now
unless
christine
opened
the
door
to
us
and
it
was
only
on
this
condition
that
we
could
hope
to
help
her
for
we
did
not
even
know
where
the
door
might
be
suddenly
the
silence
in
the
next
room
was
disturbed
by
the
ringing
of
an
electric
bell
there
was
a
bound
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
and
erik
voice
of
thunder
somebody
ringing
walk
in
please
a
sinister
chuckle
who
has
come
bothering
now
wait
for
me
here
i
am
going
to
tell
the
siren
to
open
the
door
steps
moved
away
a
door
closed
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
the
fresh
horror
that
was
preparing
i
forgot
that
the
monster
was
only
going
out
perhaps
to
perpetrate
a
fresh
crime
i
understood
but
one
thing
christine
was
alone
behind
the
wall
the
vicomte
de
chagny
was
already
calling
to
her
christine
christine
as
we
could
hear
what
was
said
in
the
next
room
there
was
no
reason
why
my
companion
should
not
be
heard
in
his
turn
nevertheless
the
viscount
had
to
repeat
his
cry
time
after
time
at
last
a
faint
voice
reached
us
i
am
dreaming
it
said
christine
christine
it
is
i
raoul
a
silence
but
answer
me
christine
in
heaven
name
if
you
are
alone
answer
me
then
christine
voice
whispered
raoul
name
yes
yes
it
is
i
it
is
not
a
dream
christine
trust
me
we
are
here
to
save
you
but
be
prudent
when
you
hear
the
monster
warn
us
then
christine
gave
way
to
fear
she
trembled
lest
erik
should
discover
where
raoul
was
hidden
she
told
us
in
a
few
hurried
words
that
erik
had
gone
quite
mad
with
love
and
that
he
had
decided
to
kill
everybody
and
himself
with
everybody
if
she
did
not
consent
to
become
his
wife
he
had
given
her
till
eleven
the
next
evening
for
reflection
it
was
the
last
respite
she
must
choose
as
he
said
between
the
wedding
mass
and
the
requiem
and
erik
had
then
uttered
a
phrase
which
christine
did
not
quite
understand
yes
or
no
if
your
answer
is
no
everybody
will
be
dead
and
buried
but
i
understood
the
sentence
perfectly
for
it
corresponded
in
a
terrible
manner
with
my
own
dreadful
thought
can
you
tell
us
where
erik
is
i
asked
she
replied
that
he
must
have
left
the
house
could
you
make
sure
no
i
am
fastened
i
can
not
stir
a
limb
when
we
heard
this
de
chagny
and
i
gave
a
yell
of
fury
our
safety
the
safety
of
all
three
of
us
depended
on
the
girl
liberty
of
movement
but
where
are
you
asked
christine
there
are
only
two
doors
in
my
room
the
room
of
which
i
told
you
raoul
a
door
through
which
erik
comes
and
goes
and
another
which
he
has
never
opened
before
me
and
which
he
has
forbidden
me
ever
to
go
through
because
he
says
it
is
the
most
dangerous
of
the
doors
the
door
of
the
christine
that
is
where
we
are
you
are
in
the
yes
but
we
can
not
see
the
door
oh
if
i
could
only
drag
myself
so
far
i
would
knock
at
the
door
and
that
would
tell
you
where
it
is
is
it
a
door
with
a
lock
to
it
i
asked
yes
with
a
lock
mademoiselle
i
said
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
open
that
door
to
us
but
how
asked
the
poor
girl
tearfully
we
heard
her
straining
trying
to
free
herself
from
the
bonds
that
held
her
i
know
where
the
key
is
she
said
in
a
voice
that
seemed
exhausted
by
the
effort
she
had
made
but
i
am
fastened
so
tight
oh
the
wretch
and
she
gave
a
sob
where
is
the
key
i
asked
signing
to
de
chagny
not
to
speak
and
to
leave
the
business
to
me
for
we
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
in
the
next
room
near
the
organ
with
another
little
bronze
key
which
he
also
forbade
me
to
touch
they
are
both
in
a
little
leather
bag
which
he
calls
the
bag
of
life
and
death
raoul
raoul
fly
everything
is
mysterious
and
terrible
here
and
erik
will
soon
have
gone
quite
mad
and
you
are
in
the
go
back
by
the
way
you
came
there
must
be
a
reason
why
the
room
is
called
by
that
name
christine
said
the
young
man
we
will
go
from
here
together
or
die
together
we
must
keep
cool
i
whispered
why
has
he
fastened
you
mademoiselle
you
ca
escape
from
his
house
and
he
knows
it
i
tried
to
commit
suicide
the
monster
went
out
last
night
after
carrying
me
here
fainting
and
half
chloroformed
he
was
going
to
his
banker
so
he
said
when
he
returned
he
found
me
with
my
face
covered
with
blood
i
had
tried
to
kill
myself
by
striking
my
forehead
against
the
walls
christine
groaned
raoul
and
he
began
to
sob
then
he
bound
me
i
am
not
allowed
to
die
until
eleven
evening
mademoiselle
i
declared
the
monster
bound
you
and
he
shall
unbind
you
you
have
only
to
play
the
necessary
part
remember
that
he
loves
you
alas
we
heard
am
i
likely
to
forget
it
remember
it
and
smile
to
him
entreat
him
tell
him
that
your
bonds
hurt
you
but
christine
daae
said
hush
i
hear
something
in
the
wall
on
the
lake
it
is
he
go
away
go
away
go
away
we
could
not
go
away
even
if
we
wanted
to
i
said
as
impressively
as
i
could
we
can
not
leave
this
and
we
are
in
the
hush
whispered
christine
again
heavy
steps
sounded
slowly
behind
the
wall
then
stopped
and
made
the
floor
creak
once
more
next
came
a
tremendous
sigh
followed
by
a
cry
of
horror
from
christine
and
we
heard
erik
voice
i
beg
your
pardon
for
letting
you
see
a
face
like
this
what
a
state
i
am
in
am
i
not
it
the
other
one
fault
why
did
he
ring
do
i
ask
people
who
pass
to
tell
me
the
time
he
will
never
ask
anybody
the
time
again
it
is
the
siren
fault

page

another
sigh
deeper
more
tremendous
still
came
from
the
abysmal
depths
of
a
soul
why
did
you
cry
out
christine
because
i
am
in
pain
erik
i
thought
i
had
frightened
you
erik
unloose
my
bonds
am
i
not
your
prisoner
you
will
try
to
kill
yourself
again
you
have
given
me
till
eleven
evening
erik
the
footsteps
dragged
along
the
floor
again
after
all
as
we
are
to
die
together
and
i
am
just
as
eager
as
you
yes
i
have
had
enough
of
this
life
you
know
wait
do
move
i
will
release
you
you
have
only
one
word
to
say
and
it
will
at
once
be
over
with
everybody
you
are
right
you
are
right
why
wait
till
eleven
evening
true
it
would
have
been
grander
finer
but
that
is
childish
nonsense
we
should
only
think
of
ourselves
in
this
life
of
our
own
death
the
rest
does
matter
you
looking
at
me
because
i
am
all
wet
oh
my
dear
it
raining
cats
and
dogs
outside
apart
from
that
christine
i
think
i
am
subject
to
hallucinations
you
know
the
man
who
rang
at
the
siren
door
just
now
go
and
look
if
he
ringing
at
the
bottom
of
the
he
was
rather
like
there
turn
round
are
you
glad
you
free
now
oh
my
poor
christine
look
at
your
wrists
tell
me
have
i
hurt
them
that
alone
deserves
death
talking
of
death
i
must
sing
his
requiem
hearing
these
terrible
remarks
i
received
an
awful
presentiment
i
too
had
once
rung
at
the
monster
door
and
without
knowing
it
must
have
set
some
warning
current
in
motion
and
i
remembered
the
two
arms
that
had
emerged
from
the
inky
waters
what
poor
wretch
had
strayed
to
that
shore
this
time
who
was
other
one
the
one
whose
requiem
we
now
heard
sung
erik
sang
like
the
god
of
thunder
sang
a
dies
irae
that
enveloped
us
as
in
a
storm
the
elements
seemed
to
rage
around
us
suddenly
the
organ
and
the
voice
ceased
so
suddenly
that
de
chagny
sprang
back
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
with
emotion
and
the
voice
changed
and
transformed
distinctly
grated
out
these
metallic
syllables
what
have
you
done
with
my
bag
chapter
xxiii
the
tortures
begin
the
persian
narrative
continued
the
voice
repeated
angrily
what
have
you
done
with
my
bag
so
it
was
to
take
my
bag
that
you
asked
me
to
release
you
we
heard
hurried
steps
christine
running
back
to
the
room
as
though
to
seek
shelter
on
the
other
side
of
our
wall
what
are
you
running
away
for
asked
the
furious
voice
which
had
followed
her
give
me
back
my
bag
will
you
do
you
know
that
it
is
the
bag
of
life
and
death
listen
to
me
erik
sighed
the
girl
as
it
is
settled
that
we
are
to
live
together
what
difference
can
it
make
to
you
you
know
there
are
only
two
keys
in
it
said
the
monster
what
do
you
want
to
do
i
want
to
look
at
this
room
which
i
have
never
seen
and
which
you
have
always
kept
from
me
it
woman
curiosity
she
said
in
a
tone
which
she
tried
to
render
playful
but
the
trick
was
too
childish
for
erik
to
be
taken
in
by
it
i
do
like
curious
women
he
retorted
and
you
had
better
remember
the
story
of
and
be
careful
come
give
me
back
my
bag
give
me
back
my
bag
leave
the
key
alone
will
you
you
inquisitive
little
thing
and
he
chuckled
while
christine
gave
a
cry
of
pain
erik
had
evidently
recovered
the
bag
from
her
at
that
moment
the
viscount
could
not
help
uttering
an
exclamation
of
impotent
rage
why
what
that
said
the
monster
did
you
hear
christine
no
no
replied
the
poor
girl
i
heard
nothing
i
thought
i
heard
a
cry
a
cry
are
you
going
mad
erik
whom
do
you
expect
to
give
a
cry
in
this
house
i
cried
out
because
you
hurt
me
i
heard
nothing
i
do
like
the
way
you
said
that
you
trembling
quite
excited
you
lying
that
was
a
cry
there
was
a
cry
there
is
some
one
in
the
ah
i
understand
now
there
is
no
one
there
erik
i
understand
no
one
the
man
you
want
to
marry
perhaps
i
do
want
to
marry
anybody
you
know
i
do
another
nasty
chuckle
well
it
wo
take
long
to
find
out
christine
my
love
we
need
not
open
the
door
to
see
what
is
happening
in
the
would
you
like
to
see
would
you
like
to
see
look
here
if
there
is
some
one
if
there
is
really
some
one
there
you
will
see
the
invisible
window
light
up
at
the
top
near
the
ceiling
we
need
only
draw
the
black
curtain
and
put
out
the
light
in
here
there
that
it
let
put
out
the
light
you
not
afraid
of
the
dark
when
you
with
your
little
husband
then
we
heard
christine
voice
of
anguish
no
i
frightened
i
tell
you
i
afraid
of
the
dark
i
do
care
about
that
room
now
you
always
frightening
me
like
a
child
with
your
and
so
i
became
inquisitive
but
i
do
care
about
it
now
not
a
bit
not
a
bit
and
that
which
i
feared
above
all
things
began
automatically
we
were
suddenly
flooded
with
light
yes
on
our
side
of
the
wall
everything
seemed
aglow
the
vicomte
de
chagny
was
so
much
taken
aback
that
he
staggered
and
the
angry
voice
roared
i
told
you
there
was
some
one
do
you
see
the
window
now
the
lighted
window
right
up
there
the
man
behind
the
wall
ca
see
it
but
you
shall
go
up
the
folding
steps
that
is
what
they
are
there
for
you
have
often
asked
me
to
tell
you
and
now
you
know
they
are
there
to
give
a
peep
into
the
you
inquisitive
little
thing
what
tortures
who
is
being
tortured
erik
erik
say
you
are
only
trying
to
frighten
me
say
it
if
you
love
me
erik
there
are
no
tortures
are
there
go
and
look
at
the
little
window
dear
i
do
not
know
if
the
viscount
heard
the
girl
swooning
voice
for
he
was
too
much
occupied
by
the
astounding
spectacle
that
now
appeared
before
his
distracted
gaze
as
for
me
i
had
seen
that
sight
too
often
through
the
little
window
at
the
time
of
the
rosy
hours
of
mazenderan
and
i
cared
only
for
what
was
being
said
next
door
seeking
for
a
hint
how
to
act
what
resolution
to
take
go
and
peep
through
the
little
window
tell
me
what
he
looks
like
we
heard
the
steps
being
dragged
against
the
wall
up
with
you
no
no
i
will
go
up
myself
dear
oh
very
well
i
will
go
up
let
me
go
oh
my
darling
my
darling
how
sweet
of
you
how
nice
of
you
to
save
me
the
exertion
at
my
age
tell
me
what
he
looks
like
at
that
moment
we
distinctly
heard
these
words
above
our
heads
there
is
no
one
there
dear
no
one
are
you
sure
there
is
no
one
why
of
course
not
no
one
well
that
all
right
what
the
matter
christine
you
not
going
to
faint
are
you
as
there
is
no
one
there
here
come
down
there
pull
yourself
together
as
there
is
no
one
there
but
how
do
you
like
the
landscape
oh
very
much
there
that
better
you
better
now
are
you
not
all
right

excitement
and
what
a
funny
house
is
it
with
landscapes
like
that
in
it
yes
it
like
the
musee
grevin
but
say
erik
there
are
no
tortures
in
there
what
a
fright
you
gave
me
why
as
there
is
no
one
there
did
you
design
that
room
it
very
handsome
you
a
great
artist
erik
yes
a
great
artist
in
my
own
line
but
tell
me
erik
why
did
you
call
that
room
the
oh
it
very
simple
first
of
all
what
did
you
see
i
saw
a
forest
and
what
is
in
a
forest
trees
and
what
is
in
a
tree
birds
did
you
see
any
birds
no
i
did
not
see
any
birds
well
what
did
you
see
think
you
saw
branches
and
what
are
the
branches
asked
the
terrible
voice
there
a
gibbet
that
is
why
i
call
my
wood
the
you
see
it
all
a
joke
i
never
express
myself
like
other
people
but
i
am
very
tired
of
it
i
sick
and
tired
of
having
a
forest
and
a
in
my
house
and
of
living
like
a
mountebank
in
a
house
with
a
false
bottom
i
tired
of
it
i
want
to
have
a
nice
quiet
flat
with
ordinary
doors
and
windows
and
a
wife
inside
it
like
anybody
else
a
wife
whom
i
could
love
and
take
out
on
sundays
and
keep
amused
on
here
shall
i
show
you
some
that
will
help
us
to
pass
a
few
minutes
while
waiting
for
eleven
evening
my
dear
little
christine
are
you
listening
to
me
tell
me
you
love
me
no
you
do
love
me
but
no
matter
you
will
once
you
could
not
look
at
my
mask
because
you
knew
what
was
behind
and
now
you
do
mind
looking
at
it
and
you
forget
what
is
behind
one
can
get
used
to
everything
if
one
wishes
plenty
of
young
people
who
did
not
care
for
each
other
before
marriage
have
adored
each
other
since
oh
i
do
know
what
i
am
talking
about
but
you
would
have
lots
of
fun
with
me
for
instance
i
am
the
greatest
ventriloquist
that
ever
lived
i
am
the
first
ventriloquist
in
the
world
you
laughing
perhaps
you
do
believe
me
listen
the
wretch
who
really
was
the
first
ventriloquist
in
the
world
was
only
trying
to
divert
the
child
attention
from
the
but
it
was
a
stupid
scheme
for
christine
thought
of
nothing
but
us
she
repeatedly
besought
him
in
the
gentlest
tones
which
she
could
assume
put
out
the
light
in
the
little
window
erik
do
put
out
the
light
in
the
little
window
for
she
saw
that
this
light
which
appeared
so
suddenly
and
of
which
the
monster
had
spoken
in
so
threatening
a
voice
must
mean
something
terrible
one
thing
must
have
pacified
her
for
a
moment
and
that
was
seeing
the
two
of
us
behind
the
wall
in
the
midst
of
that
resplendent
light
alive
and
well
but
she
would
certainly
have
felt
much
easier
if
the
light
had
been
put
out
meantime
the
other
had
already
begun
to
play
the
ventriloquist
he
said
here
i
raise
my
mask
a
little
oh
only
a
little
you
see
my
lips
such
lips
as
i
have
they
not
moving
my
mouth
is
closed
such
mouth
as
i
have
and
yet
you
hear
my
voice
where
will
you
have
it
in
your
left
ear
in
your
right
ear
in
the
table
in
those
little
ebony
boxes
on
the
mantelpiece
listen
dear
it
in
the
little
box
on
the
right
of
the
mantelpiece
what
does
it
say
i
turn
the
scorpion
and
now
crack
what
does
it
say
in
the
little
box
on
the
left
i
turn
the
grasshopper
and
now
crack
here
it
is
in
the
little
leather
bag
what
does
it
say

the
little
bag
of
life
and
death
and
now
crack
it
is
in
carlotta
throat
in
carlotta
golden
throat
in
crystal
throat
as
i
live
what
does
it
say
it
says
i
toad
it
i
singing
i
feel
without
alarm
with
its
melody
enwind
me
and
now
crack
it
is
on
a
chair
in
the
ghost
box
and
it
says
carlotta
is
singing
to
bring
the
chandelier
down
and
now
crack
aha
where
is
erik
voice
now

christine
darling

is
behind
the
door
of
the
listen

in
the
and
what
do
i
say
i
say
to
them
that
have
a
nose
a
real
nose
and
come
to
look
round
the
aha
aha
aha
oh
the
ventriloquist
terrible
voice
it
was
everywhere
everywhere
it
passed
through
the
little
invisible
window
through
the
walls
it
ran
around
us
between
us
erik
was
there
speaking
to
us
we
made
a
movement
as
though
to
fling
ourselves
upon
him
but
already
swifter
more
fleeting
than
the
voice
of
the
echo
erik
voice
had
leaped
back
behind
the
wall
soon
we
heard
nothing
more
at
all
for
this
is
what
happened
erik
erik
said
christine
voice
you
tire
me
with
your
voice
do
go
on
erik
is
it
very
hot
here
oh
yes
replied
erik
voice
the
heat
is
unendurable
but
what
does
this
mean
the
wall
is
really
getting
quite
hot
the
wall
is
burning
i
tell
you
christine
dear
it
is
because
of
the
forest
next
door
well
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
the
forest
why
did
you
see
that
it
was
an
african
forest
and
the
monster
laughed
so
loudly
and
hideously
that
we
could
no
longer
distinguish
christine
supplicating
cries
the
vicomte
de
chagny
shouted
and
banged
against
the
walls
like
a
madman
i
could
not
restrain
him
but
we
heard
nothing
except
the
monster
laughter
and
the
monster
himself
can
have
heard
nothing
else
and
then
there
was
the
sound
of
a
body
falling
on
the
floor
and
being
dragged
along
and
a
door
slammed
and
then
nothing
nothing
more
around
us
save
the
scorching
silence
of
the
south
in
the
heart
of
a
tropical
forest

narrative
continued
i
have
said
that
the
room
in
which
le
vicomte
de
chagny
and
i
were
imprisoned
was
a
regular
hexagon
lined
entirely
with
mirrors
plenty
of
these
rooms
have
been
seen
since
mainly
at
exhibitions
they
are
called
palaces
of
illusion
or
some
such
name
but
the
invention
belongs
entirely
to
erik
who
built
the
first
room
of
this
kind
under
my
eyes
at
the
time
of
the
rosy
hours
of
mazenderan
a
decorative
object
such
as
a
column
for
instance
was
placed
in
one
of
the
corners
and
immediately
produced
a
hall
of
a
thousand
columns
for
thanks
to
the
mirrors
the
real
room
was
multiplied
by
six
hexagonal
rooms
each
of
which
in
its
turn
was
multiplied
indefinitely
but
the
little
sultana
soon
tired
of
this
infantile
illusion
whereupon
erik
altered
his
invention
into
a
for
the
architectural
motive
placed
in
one
corner
he
substituted
an
iron
tree
this
tree
with
its
painted
leaves
was
absolutely
true
to
life
and
was
made
of
iron
so
as
to
resist
all
the
attacks
of
the
patient
who
was
locked
into
the
we
shall
see
how
the
scene
thus
obtained
was
twice
altered
instantaneously
into
two
successive
other
scenes
by
means
of
the
automatic
rotation
of
the
drums
or
rollers
in
the
corners
these
were
divided
into
three
sections
fitting
into
the
angles
of
the
mirrors
and
each
supporting
a
decorative
scheme
that
came
into
sight
as
the
roller
revolved
upon
its
axis
the
walls
of
this
strange
room
gave
the
patient
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
because
apart
from
the
solid
decorative
object
they
were
simply
furnished
with
mirrors
thick
enough
to
withstand
any
onslaught
of
the
victim
who
was
flung
into
the
chamber
and
barefoot
there
was
no
furniture
the
ceiling
was
capable
of
being
lit
up
an
ingenious
system
of
electric
heating
which
has
since
been
imitated
allowed
the
temperature
of
the
walls
and
room
to
be
increased
at
will
i
am
giving
all
these
details
of
a
perfectly
natural
invention
producing
with
a
few
painted
branches
the
supernatural
illusion
of
an
equatorial
forest
blazing
under
the
tropical
sun
so
that
no
one
may
doubt
the
present
balance
of
my
brain
or
feel
entitled
to
say
that
i
am
mad
or
lying
or
that
i
take
him
for
a
fool
i
now
return
to
the
facts
where
i
left
them
when
the
ceiling
lit
up
and
the
forest
became
visible
around
us
the
viscount
stupefaction
was
immense
that
impenetrable
forest
with
its
innumerable
trunks
and
branches
threw
him
into
a
terrible
state
of
consternation
he
passed
his
hands
over
his
forehead
as
though
to
drive
away
a
dream
his
eyes
blinked
and
for
a
moment
he
forgot
to
listen
i
have
already
said
that
the
sight
of
the
forest
did
not
surprise
me
at
all
and
therefore
i
listened
for
the
two
of
us
to
what
was
happening
next
door
lastly
my
attention
was
especially
attracted
not
so
much
to
the
scene
as
to
the
mirrors
that
produced
it
these
mirrors
were
broken
in
parts
yes
they
were
marked
and
scratched
they
had
been
starred
in
spite
of
their
solidity
and
this
proved
to
me
that
the
in
which
we
now
were
had
already
served
a
purpose
yes
some
wretch
whose
feet
were
not
bare
like
those
of
the
victims
of
the
rosy
hours
of
mazenderan
had
certainly
fallen
into
this
mortal
illusion
and
mad
with
rage
had
kicked
against
those
mirrors
which
nevertheless
continued
to
reflect
his
agony
and
the
branch
of
the
tree
on
which
he
had
put
an
end
to
his
own
sufferings
was
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
before
dying
he
had
seen
for
his
last
consolation
a
thousand
men
writhing
in
his
company
yes
joseph
buquet
had
undoubtedly
been
through
all
this
were
we
to
die
as
he
had
done
i
did
not
think
so
for
i
knew
that
we
had
a
few
hours
before
us
and
that
i
could
employ
them
to
better
purpose
than
joseph
buquet
was
able
to
do
after
all
i
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
most
of
erik
tricks
and
now
or
never
was
the
time
to
turn
my
knowledge
to
account
to
begin
with
i
gave
up
every
idea
of
returning
to
the
passage
that
had
brought
us
to
that
accursed
chamber
i
did
not
trouble
about
the
possibility
of
working
the
inside
stone
that
closed
the
passage
and
this
for
the
simple
reason
that
to
do
so
was
out
of
the
question
we
had
dropped
from
too
great
a
height
into
the
there
was
no
furniture
to
help
us
reach
that
passage
not
even
the
branch
of
the
iron
tree
not
even
each
other
shoulders
were
of
any
avail
there
was
only
one
possible
outlet
that
opening
into
the
room
in
which
erik
and
christine
daae
were
but
though
this
outlet
looked
like
an
ordinary
door
on
christine
side
it
was
absolutely
invisible
to
us
we
must
therefore
try
to
open
it
without
even
knowing
where
it
was
when
i
was
quite
sure
that
there
was
no
hope
for
us
from
christine
daae
side
when
i
had
heard
the
monster
dragging
the
poor
girl
from
the
room
lest
she
should
interfere
with
our
tortures
i
resolved
to
set
to
work
without
delay
but
i
had
first
to
calm
de
chagny
who
was
already
walking
about
like
a
madman
uttering
incoherent
cries
the
snatches
of
conversation
which
he
had
caught
between
christine
and
the
monster
had
contributed
not
a
little
to
drive
him
beside
himself
add
to
that
the
shock
of
the
magic
forest
and
the
scorching
heat
which
was
beginning
to
make
the
prespiration
sic
stream
down
his
temples
and
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
understanding
his
state
of
mind
he
shouted
name
brandished
his
pistol
knocked
his
forehead
against
the
glass
in
his
endeavors
to
run
down
the
glades
of
the
illusive
forest
in
short
the
torture
was
beginning
to
work
its
spell
upon
a
brain
unprepared
for
it
i
did
my
best
to
induce
the
poor
viscount
to
listen
to
reason
i
made
him
touch
the
mirrors
and
the
iron
tree
and
the
branches
and
explained
to
him
by
optical
laws
all
the
luminous
imagery
by
which
we
were
surrounded
and
of
which
we
need
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
the
victims
like
ordinary
ignorant
people
we
are
in
a
room
a
little
room
that
is
what
you
must
keep
saying
to
yourself
and
we
shall
leave
the
room
as
soon
as
we
have
found
the
door
and
i
promised
him
that
if
he
let
me
act
without
disturbing
me
by
shouting
and
walking
up
and
down
i
would
discover
the
trick
of
the
door
in
less
than
an
hour
time
then
he
lay
flat
on
the
floor
as
one
does
in
a
wood
and
declared
that
he
would
wait
until
i
found
the
door
of
the
forest
as
there
was
nothing
better
to
do
and
he
added
that
from
where
he
was
the
view
was
splendid
the
torture
was
working
in
spite
of
all
that
i
had
said
myself
forgetting
the
forest
i
tackled
a
glass
panel
and
began
to
finger
it
in
every
direction
hunting
for
the
weak
point
on
which
to
press
in
order
to
turn
the
door
in
accordance
with
erik
system
of
pivots
this
weak
point
might
be
a
mere
speck
on
the
glass
no
larger
than
a
pea
under
which
the
spring
lay
hidden
i
hunted
and
hunted
i
felt
as
high
as
my
hands
could
reach
erik
was
about
the
same
height
as
myself
and
i
thought
that
he
would
not
have
placed
the
spring
higher
than
suited
his
stature
while
groping
over
the
successive
panels
with
the
greatest
care
i
endeavored
not
to
lose
a
minute
for
i
was
feeling
more
and
more
overcome
with
the
heat
and
we
were
literally
roasting
in
that
blazing
forest
i
had
been
working
like
this
for
half
an
hour
and
had
finished
three
panels
when
as
would
have
it
i
turned
round
on
hearing
a
muttered
exclamation
from
the
viscount
i
am
stifling
he
said
all
those
mirrors
are
sending
out
an
infernal
heat
do
you
think
you
will
find
that
spring
soon
if
you
are
much
longer
about
it
we
shall
be
roasted
alive
i
was
not
sorry
to
hear
him
talk
like
this
he
had
not
said
a
word
of
the
forest
and
i
hoped
that
my
companion
reason
would
hold
out
some
time
longer
against
the
torture
but
he
added
what
consoles
me
is
that
the
monster
has
given
christine
until
eleven
evening
if
we
ca
get
out
of
here
and
go
to
her
assistance
at
least
we
shall
be
dead
before
her
then
erik
mass
can
serve
for
all
of
us
and
he
gulped
down
a
breath
of
hot
air
that
nearly
made
him
faint
as
i
had
not
the
same
desperate
reasons
as
le
vicomte
for
accepting
death
i
returned
after
giving
him
a
word
of
encouragement
to
my
panel
but
i
had
made
the
mistake
of
taking
a
few
steps
while
speaking
and
in
the
tangle
of
the
illusive
forest
i
was
no
longer
able
to
find
my
panel
for
certain
i
had
to
begin
all
over
again
at
random
feeling
fumbling
groping
now
the
fever
laid
hold
of
me
in
my
turn
for
i
found
nothing
absolutely
nothing
in
the
next
room
all
was
silence
we
were
quite
lost
in
the
forest
without
an
outlet
a
compass
a
guide
or
anything
oh
i
knew
what
awaited
us
if
nobody
came
to
our
aid
or
if
i
did
not
find
the
spring
but
look
as
i
might
i
found
nothing
but
branches
beautiful
branches
that
stood
straight
up
before
me
or
spread
gracefully
over
my
head
but
they
gave
no
shade
and
this
was
natural
enough
as
we
were
in
an
equatorial
forest
with
the
sun
right
above
our
heads
an
african
forest
de
chagny
and
i
had
repeatedly
taken
off
our
coats
and
put
them
on
again
finding
at
one
time
that
they
made
us
feel
still
hotter
and
at
another
that
they
protected
us
against
the
heat
i
was
still
making
a
moral
resistance
but
de
chagny
seemed
to
me
quite
gone
he
pretended
that
he
had
been
walking
in
that
forest
for
three
days
and
nights
without
stopping
looking
for
christine
daae
from
time
to
time
he
thought
he
saw
her
behind
the
trunk
of
a
tree
or
gliding
between
the
branches
and
he
called
to
her
with
words
of
supplication
that
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
and
then
at
last
oh
how
thirsty
i
am
he
cried
in
delirious
accents
i
too
was
thirsty
my
throat
was
on
fire
and
yet
squatting
on
the
floor
i
went
on
hunting
hunting
hunting
for
the
spring
of
the
invisible
door
especially
as
it
was
dangerous
to
remain
in
the
forest
as
evening
drew
nigh
already
the
shades
of
night
were
beginning
to
surround
us
it
had
happened
very
quickly
night
falls
quickly
in
tropical
countries
suddenly
with
hardly
any
twilight
now
night
in
the
forests
of
the
equator
is
always
dangerous
particularly
when
like
ourselves
one
has
not
the
materials
for
a
fire
to
keep
off
the
beasts
of
prey
i
did
indeed
try
for
a
moment
to
break
off
the
branches
which
i
would
have
lit
with
my
dark
lantern
but
i
knocked
myself
also
against
the
mirrors
and
remembered
in
time
that
we
had
only
images
of
branches
to
do
with
the
heat
did
not
go
with
the
daylight
on
the
contrary
it
was
now
still
hotter
under
the
blue
rays
of
the
moon
i
urged
the
viscount
to
hold
our
weapons
ready
to
fire
and
not
to
stray
from
camp
while
i
went
on
looking
for
my
spring
suddenly
we
heard
a
lion
roaring
a
few
yards
away
oh
whispered
the
viscount
he
is
quite
close
do
you
see
him
there
through
the
trees
in
that
thicket
if
he
roars
again
i
will
fire
and
the
roaring
began
again
louder
than
before
and
the
viscount
fired
but
i
do
not
think
that
he
hit
the
lion
only
he
smashed
a
mirror
as
i
perceived
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
we
must
have
covered
a
good
distance
during
the
night
for
we
suddenly
found
ourselves
on
the
edge
of
the
desert
an
immense
desert
of
sand
stones
and
rocks
it
was
really
not
worth
while
leaving
the
forest
to
come
upon
the
desert
tired
out
i
flung
myself
down
beside
the
viscount
for
i
had
had
enough
of
looking
for
springs
which
i
could
not
find
i
was
quite
surprised
and
i
said
so
to
the
viscount
that
we
had
encountered
no
other
dangerous
animals
during
the
night
usually
after
the
lion
came
the
leopard
and
sometimes
the
buzz
of
the
tsetse
fly
these
were
easily
obtained
effects
and
i
explained
to
de
chagny
that
erik
imitated
the
roar
of
a
lion
on
a
long
tabour
or
timbrel
with
an
ass
skin
at
one
end
over
this
skin
he
tied
a
string
of
catgut
which
was
fastened
at
the
middle
to
another
similar
string
passing
through
the
whole
length
of
the
tabour
erik
had
only
to
rub
this
string
with
a
glove
smeared
with
resin
and
according
to
the
manner
in
which
he
rubbed
it
he
imitated
to
perfection
the
voice
of
the
lion
or
the
leopard
or
even
the
buzzing
of
the
tsetse
fly
the
idea
that
erik
was
probably
in
the
room
beside
us
working
his
trick
made
me
suddenly
resolve
to
enter
into
a
parley
with
him
for
we
must
obviously
give
up
all
thought
of
taking
him
by
surprise
and
by
this
time
he
must
be
quite
aware
who
were
the
occupants
of
his
i
called
him
erik
erik
i
shouted
as
loudly
as
i
could
across
the
desert
but
there
was
no
answer
to
my
voice
all
around
us
lay
the
silence
and
the
bare
immensity
of
that
stony
desert
what
was
to
become
of
us
in
the
midst
of
that
awful
solitude
we
were
beginning
literally
to
die
of
heat
hunger
and
thirst
of
thirst
especially
at
last
i
saw
de
chagny
raise
himself
on
his
elbow
and
point
to
a
spot
on
the
horizon
he
had
discovered
an
oasis
yes
far
in
the
distance
was
an
oasis
an
oasis
with
limpid
water
which
reflected
the
iron
trees
tush
it
was
the
scene
of
the
mirage
i
recognized
it
at
once
the
worst
of
the
three
no
one
had
been
able
to
fight
against
it
no
one
i
did
my
utmost
to
keep
my
head
and
not
to
hope
for
water
because
i
knew
that
if
a
man
hoped
for
water
the
water
that
reflected
the
iron
tree
and
if
after
hoping
for
water
he
struck
against
the
mirror
then
there
was
only
one
thing
for
him
to
do
to
hang
himself
on
the
iron
tree
so
i
cried
to
de
chagny
it
the
mirage
it
the
mirage
do
believe
in
the
water
it
another
trick
of
the
mirrors
then
he
flatly
told
me
to
shut
up
with
my
tricks
of
the
mirrors
my
springs
my
revolving
doors
and
my
palaces
of
illusions
he
angrily
declared
that
i
must
be
either
blind
or
mad
to
imagine
that
all
that
water
flowing
over
there
among
those
splendid
numberless
trees
was
not
real
water
and
the
desert
was
real
and
so
was
the
forest
and
it
was
no
use
trying
to
take
him
in
he
was
an
old
experienced
traveler
he
had
been
all
over
the
place
and
he
dragged
himself
along
saying
water
water
and
his
mouth
was
open
as
though
he
were
drinking
and
my
mouth
was
open
too
as
though
i
were
drinking
for
we
not
only
saw
the
water
but
we
heard
it
we
heard
it
flow
we
heard
it
ripple
do
you
understand
that
word
ripple
it
is
a
sound
which
you
hear
with
your
tongue
you
put
your
tongue
out
of
your
mouth
to
listen
to
it
better
lastly
and
this
was
the
most
pitiless
torture
of
all
we
heard
the
rain
and
it
was
not
raining
this
was
an
infernal
invention
oh
i
knew
well
enough
how
erik
obtained
it
he
filled
with
little
stones
a
very
long
and
narrow
box
broken
up
inside
with
wooden
and
metal
projections
the
stones
in
falling
struck
against
these
projections
and
rebounded
from
one
to
another
and
the
result
was
a
series
of
pattering
sounds
that
exactly
imitated
a
rainstorm
ah
you
should
have
seen
us
putting
out
our
tongues
and
dragging
ourselves
toward
the
rippling
our
eyes
and
ears
were
full
of
water
but
our
tongues
were
hard
and
dry
as
horn
when
we
reached
the
mirror
de
chagny
licked
it
and
i
also
licked
the
glass
it
was
burning
hot
then
we
rolled
on
the
floor
with
a
hoarse
cry
of
despair
de
chagny
put
the
one
pistol
that
was
still
loaded
to
his
temple
and
i
stared
at
the
punjab
lasso
at
the
foot
of
the
iron
tree
i
knew
why
the
iron
tree
had
returned
in
this
third
change
of
scene
the
iron
tree
was
waiting
for
me
but
as
i
stared
at
the
punjab
lasso
i
saw
a
thing
that
made
me
start
so
violently
that
de
chagny
delayed
his
attempt
at
suicide
i
took
his
arm
and
then
i
caught
the
pistol
from
him
and
then
i
dragged
myself
on
my
knees
toward
what
i
had
seen
i
had
discovered
near
the
punjab
lasso
in
a
groove
in
the
floor
a
nail
of
which
i
knew
the
use
at
last
i
had
discovered
the
spring
i
felt
the
nail
i
lifted
a
radiant
face
to
de
chagny
the
nail
yielded
to
my
pressure
and
then
and
then
we
saw
not
a
door
opened
in
the
wall
but
a
released
in
the
floor
cool
air
came
up
to
us
from
the
black
hole
below
we
stooped
over
that
square
of
darkness
as
though
over
a
limpid
well
with
our
chins
in
the
cool
shade
we
drank
it
in
and
we
bent
lower
and
lower
over
the
what
could
there
be
in
that
cellar
which
opened
before
us
water
water
to
drink
i
thrust
my
arm
into
the
darkness
and
came
upon
a
stone
and
another
stone
a
staircase
a
dark
staircase
leading
into
the
cellar
the
viscount
wanted
to
fling
himself
down
the
hole
but
i
fearing
a
new
trick
of
the
monster
stopped
him
turned
on
my
dark
lantern
and
went
down
first
the
staircase
was
a
winding
one
and
led
down
into
pitchy
darkness
but
oh
how
deliciously
cool
were
the
darkness
and
the
stairs
the
lake
could
not
be
far
away
we
soon
reached
the
bottom
our
eyes
were
beginning
to
accustom
themselves
to
the
dark
to
distinguish
shapes
around
us
circular
shapes
on
which
i
turned
the
light
of
my
lantern
barrels
we
were
in
erik
cellar
it
was
here
that
he
must
keep
his
wine
and
perhaps
his
i
knew
that
erik
was
a
great
lover
of
good
wine
ah
there
was
plenty
to
drink
here
de
chagny
patted
the
round
shapes
and
kept
on
saying
barrels
barrels
what
a
lot
of
barrels
indeed
there
was
quite
a
number
of
them
symmetrically
arranged
in
two
rows
one
on
either
side
of
us
they
were
small
barrels
and
i
thought
that
erik
must
have
selected
them
of
that
size
to
facilitate
their
carriage
to
the
house
on
the
lake
we
examined
them
successively
to
see
if
one
of
them
had
not
a
funnel
showing
that
it
had
been
tapped
at
some
time
or
another
but
all
the
barrels
were
hermetically
closed
then
after
half
lifting
one
to
make
sure
it
was
full
we
went
on
our
knees
and
with
the
blade
of
a
small
knife
which
i
carried
i
prepared
to
stave
in
the
at
that
moment
i
seemed
to
hear
coming
from
very
far
a
sort
of
monotonous
chant
which
i
knew
well
from
often
hearing
it
in
the
streets
of
paris
barrels
barrels
any
barrels
to
sell
my
hand
desisted
from
its
work
de
chagny
had
also
heard
he
said
that
funny
it
sounds
as
if
the
barrel
were
singing
the
song
was
renewed
farther
away
barrels
barrels
any
barrels
to
sell
oh
i
swear
said
the
viscount
that
the
tune
dies
away
in
the
barrel
we
stood
up
and
went
to
look
behind
the
barrel
it
inside
said
de
chagny
it
inside
but
we
heard
nothing
there
and
were
driven
to
accuse
the
bad
condition
of
our
senses
and
we
returned
to
the
de
chagny
put
his
two
hands
together
underneath
it
and
with
a
last
effort
i
burst
the
bung
what
this
cried
the
viscount
this
is
water
the
viscount
put
his
two
full
hands
close
to
my
lantern
i
stooped
to
look
and
at
once
threw
away
the
lantern
with
such
violence
that
it
broke
and
went
out
leaving
us
in
utter
darkness
what
i
had
seen
in
de
chagny
hands
was
it
is
very
natural
that
at
the
time
when
the
persian
was
writing
he
should
take
so
many
precautions
against
any
spirit
of
incredulity
on
the
part
of
those
who
were
likely
to
read
his
narrative
nowadays
when
we
have
all
seen
this
sort
of
room
his
precautions
would
be
superfluous
chapter
xxv
the
scorpion
or
the
grasshopper
which
the
persian
narrative
concluded
the
discovery
flung
us
into
a
state
of
alarm
that
made
us
forget
all
our
past
and
present
sufferings
we
now
knew
all
that
the
monster
meant
to
convey
when
he
said
to
christine
daae
yes
or
no
if
your
answer
is
no
everybody
will
be
dead
and
buried
yes
buried
under
the
ruins
of
the
paris
grand
opera
the
monster
had
given
her
until
eleven
in
the
evening
he
had
chosen
his
time
well
there
would
be
many
people
many
members
of
the
human
race
up
there
in
the
resplendent
theater
what
finer
retinue
could
be
expected
for
his
funeral
he
would
go
down
to
the
tomb
escorted
by
the
whitest
shoulders
in
the
world
decked
with
the
richest
jewels
eleven
evening
we
were
all
to
be
blown
up
in
the
middle
of
the
performance
if
christine
daae
said
no
eleven
evening
and
what
else
could
christine
say
but
no
would
she
not
prefer
to
espouse
death
itself
rather
than
that
living
corpse
she
did
not
know
that
on
her
acceptance
or
refusal
depended
the
awful
fate
of
many
members
of
the
human
race
eleven
evening
and
we
dragged
ourselves
through
the
darkness
feeling
our
way
to
the
stone
steps
for
the
light
in
the
overhead
that
led
to
the
room
of
mirrors
was
now
extinguished
and
we
repeated
to
ourselves
eleven
evening
at
last
i
found
the
staircase
but
suddenly
i
drew
myself
up
on
the
first
step
for
a
terrible
thought
had
come
to
my
mind
what
is
the
time
ah
what
was
the
time
for
after
all
eleven
evening
might
be
now
might
be
this
very
moment
who
could
tell
us
the
time
we
seemed
to
have
been
imprisoned
in
that
hell
for
days
and
days
for
years
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
perhaps
we
should
be
blown
up
then
and
there
ah
a
sound
a
crack
did
you
hear
that
there
in
the
corner
good
heavens
like
a
sound
of
machinery
again
oh
for
a
light
perhaps
it
the
machinery
that
is
to
blow
everything
up
i
tell
you
a
cracking
sound
are
you
deaf
de
chagny
and
i
began
to
yell
like
madmen
fear
spurred
us
on
we
rushed
up
the
treads
of
the
staircase
stumbling
as
we
went
anything
to
escape
the
dark
to
return
to
the
mortal
light
of
the
room
of
mirrors
we
found
the
still
open
but
it
was
now
as
dark
in
the
room
of
mirrors
as
in
the
cellar
which
we
had
left
we
dragged
ourselves
along
the
floor
of
the
the
floor
that
separated
us
from
the
what
was
the
time
we
shouted
we
called
de
chagny
to
christine
i
to
erik
i
reminded
him
that
i
had
saved
his
life
but
no
answer
save
that
of
our
despair
of
our
madness
what
was
the
time
we
argued
we
tried
to
calculate
the
time
which
we
had
spent
there
but
we
were
incapable
of
reasoning
if
only
we
could
see
the
face
of
a
watch
mine
had
stopped
but
de
chagny
was
still
going
he
told
me
that
he
had
wound
it
up
before
dressing
for
the
opera
we
had
not
a
match
upon
us
and
yet
we
must
know
de
chagny
broke
the
glass
of
his
watch
and
felt
the
two
hands
he
questioned
the
hands
of
the
watch
with
his
going
by
the
position
of
the
ring
of
the
watch
judging
by
the
space
between
the
hands
he
thought
it
might
be
just
eleven
but
perhaps
it
was
not
the
eleven
of
which
we
stood
in
dread
perhaps
we
had
still
twelve
hours
before
us
suddenly
i
exclaimed
hush
i
seemed
to
hear
footsteps
in
the
next
room
some
one
tapped
against
the
wall
christine
daae
voice
said
raoul
raoul
we
were
now
all
talking
at
once
on
either
side
of
the
wall
christine
sobbed
she
was
not
sure
that
she
would
find
de
chagny
alive
the
monster
had
been
terrible
it
seemed
had
done
nothing
but
rave
waiting
for
her
to
give
him
the
yes
which
she
refused
and
yet
she
had
promised
him
that
yes
if
he
would
take
her
to
the
but
he
had
obstinately
declined
and
had
uttered
hideous
threats
against
all
the
members
of
the
human
race
at
last
after
hours
and
hours
of
that
hell
he
had
that
moment
gone
out
leaving
her
alone
to
reflect
for
the
last
time
hours
and
hours
what
is
the
time
now
what
is
the
time
christine
it
is
eleven
eleven
all
but
five
minutes
but
which
eleven
the
eleven
that
is
to
decide
life
or
death
he
told
me
so
just
before
he
went
he
is
terrible
he
is
quite
mad
he
tore
off
his
mask
and
his
yellow
eyes
shot
flames
he
did
nothing
but
laugh
he
said
give
you
five
minutes
to
spare
your
blushes
here
he
said
taking
a
key
from
the
little
bag
of
life
and
death
is
the
little
bronze
key
that
opens
the
two
ebony
caskets
on
the
mantelpiece
in
the
room
in
one
of
the
caskets
you
will
find
a
scorpion
in
the
other
a
grasshopper
both
very
cleverly
imitated
in
japanese
bronze
they
will
say
yes
or
no
for
you
if
you
turn
the
scorpion
round
that
will
mean
to
me
when
i
return
that
you
have
said
yes
the
grasshopper
will
mean
no
and
he
laughed
like
a
drunken
demon
i
did
nothing
but
beg
and
entreat
him
to
give
me
the
key
of
the
promising
to
be
his
wife
if
he
granted
me
that
request
but
he
told
me
that
there
was
no
future
need
for
that
key
and
that
he
was
going
to
throw
it
into
the
lake
and
he
again
laughed
like
a
drunken
demon
and
left
me
oh
his
last
words
were
grasshopper
be
careful
of
the
grasshopper
a
grasshopper
does
not
only
turn
it
hops
it
hops
and
it
hops
jolly
high
the
five
minutes
had
nearly
elapsed
and
the
scorpion
and
the
grasshopper
were
scratching
at
my
brain
nevertheless
i
had
sufficient
lucidity
left
to
understand
that
if
the
grasshopper
were
turned
it
would
hop
and
with
it
many
members
of
the
human
race
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
the
grasshopper
controlled
an
electric
current
intended
to
blow
up
the
de
chagny
who
seemed
to
have
recovered
all
his
moral
force
from
hearing
christine
voice
explained
to
her
in
a
few
hurried
words
the
situation
in
which
we
and
all
the
opera
were
he
told
her
to
turn
the
scorpion
at
once
there
was
a
pause
christine
i
cried
where
are
you
by
the
scorpion
do
touch
it
the
idea
had
come
to
me
for
i
knew
my
erik
that
the
monster
had
perhaps
deceived
the
girl
once
more
perhaps
it
was
the
scorpion
that
would
blow
everything
up
after
all
why
was
he
there
the
five
minutes
were
long
past
and
he
was
not
back
perhaps
he
had
taken
shelter
and
was
waiting
for
the
explosion
why
had
he
not
returned
he
could
not
really
expect
christine
ever
to
consent
to
become
his
voluntary
prey
why
had
he
not
returned
do
touch
the
scorpion
i
said
here
he
comes
cried
christine
i
hear
him
here
he
is
we
heard
his
steps
approaching
the
room
he
came
up
to
christine
but
did
not
speak
then
i
raised
my
voice
erik
it
is
i
do
you
know
me
with
extraordinary
calmness
he
at
once
replied
so
you
are
not
dead
in
there
well
then
see
that
you
keep
quiet
i
tried
to
speak
but
he
said
coldly
not
a
word
daroga
or
i
shall
blow
everything
up
and
he
added
the
honor
rests
with
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
has
not
touched
the
scorpion
how
deliberately
he
spoke
mademoiselle
has
not
touched
the
grasshopper
with
that
composure
but
it
is
not
too
late
to
do
the
right
thing
there
i
open
the
caskets
without
a
key
for
i
am
a
lover
and
i
open
and
shut
what
i
please
and
as
i
please
i
open
the
little
ebony
caskets
mademoiselle
look
at
the
little
dears
inside
are
they
pretty
if
you
turn
the
grasshopper
mademoiselle
we
shall
all
be
blown
up
there
is
enough
under
our
feet
to
blow
up
a
whole
quarter
of
paris
if
you
turn
the
scorpion
mademoiselle
all
that
powder
will
be
soaked
and
drowned
mademoiselle
to
celebrate
our
wedding
you
shall
make
a
very
handsome
present
to
a
few
hundred
parisians
who
are
at
this
moment
applauding
a
poor
masterpiece
of
meyerbeer
you
shall
make
them
a
present
of
their
lives
for
with
your
own
fair
hands
you
shall
turn
the
scorpion
and
merrily
merrily
we
will
be
married
a
pause
and
then
if
in
two
minutes
mademoiselle
you
have
not
turned
the
scorpion
i
shall
turn
the
grasshopper
and
the
grasshopper
i
tell
you
hops
jolly
high
the
terrible
silence
began
anew
the
vicomte
de
chagny
realizing
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
pray
went
down
on
his
knees
and
prayed
as
for
me
my
blood
beat
so
fiercely
that
i
had
to
take
my
heart
in
both
hands
lest
it
should
burst
at
last
we
heard
voice
the
two
minutes
are
past
mademoiselle
hop
grasshopper
erik
cried
christine
do
you
swear
to
me
monster
do
you
swear
to
me
that
the
scorpion
is
the
one
to
turn
yes
to
hop
at
our
wedding
ah
you
see
you
said
to
hop
at
our
wedding
ingenuous
child
the
scorpion
opens
the
ball
but
that
will
do
you
wo
have
the
scorpion
then
i
turn
the
grasshopper
erik
enough
i
was
crying
out
in
concert
with
christine
de
chagny
was
still
on
his
knees
praying
erik
i
have
turned
the
scorpion
oh
the
second
through
which
we
passed
waiting
waiting
to
find
ourselves
in
fragments
amid
the
roar
and
the
ruins
feeling
something
crack
beneath
our
feet
hearing
an
appalling
hiss
through
the
open
a
hiss
like
the
first
sound
of
a
rocket
it
came
softly
at
first
then
louder
then
very
loud
but
it
was
not
the
hiss
of
fire
it
was
more
like
the
hiss
of
water
and
now
it
became
a
gurgling
sound
guggle
guggle
we
rushed
to
the
all
our
thirst
which
vanished
when
the
terror
came
now
returned
with
the
lapping
of
the
water
the
water
rose
in
the
cellar
above
the
barrels
the
barrels
barrels
any
barrels
to
sell
and
we
went
down
to
it
with
parched
throats
it
rose
to
our
chins
to
our
mouths
and
we
drank
we
stood
on
the
floor
of
the
cellar
and
drank
and
we
went
up
the
stairs
again
in
the
dark
step
by
step
went
up
with
the
water
the
water
came
out
of
the
cellar
with
us
and
spread
over
the
floor
of
the
room
if
this
went
on
the
whole
house
on
the
lake
would
be
swamped
the
floor
of
the
had
itself
become
a
regular
little
lake
in
which
our
feet
splashed
surely
there
was
water
enough

turn
off
the
tap

erik
that
is
water
enough
for
the

off
the
tap
turn
off
the
scorpion
but
erik
did
not
reply
we
heard
nothing
but
the
water
rising
it
was
to
our
waists
christine
cried
de
chagny
christine
the
water
is
up
to
our
knees
but
christine
did
not
reply
we
heard
nothing
but
the
water
rising
no
one
no
one
in
the
next
room
no
one
to
turn
the
tap
no
one
to
turn
the
scorpion
we
were
all
alone
in
the
dark
with
the
dark
water
that
seized
us
and
clasped
us
and
froze
us
erik
erik
christine
christine
by
this
time
we
had
lost
our
foothold
and
were
spinning
round
in
the
water
carried
away
by
an
irresistible
whirl
for
the
water
turned
with
us
and
dashed
us
against
the
dark
mirror
which
thrust
us
back
again
and
our
throats
raised
above
the
whirlpool
roared
aloud
were
we
to
die
here
drowned
in
the
i
had
never
seen
that
erik
at
the
time
of
the
rosy
hours
of
mazenderan
had
never
shown
me
that
through
the
little
invisible
window
erik
erik
i
cried
i
saved
your
life
remember
you
were
sentenced
to
death
but
for
me
you
would
be
dead
now
erik
we
whirled
around
in
the
water
like
so
much
wreckage
but
suddenly
my
straying
hands
seized
the
trunk
of
the
iron
tree
i
called
de
chagny
and
we
both
hung
to
the
branch
of
the
iron
tree
and
the
water
rose
still
higher
oh
oh
can
you
remember
how
much
space
is
there
between
the
branch
of
the
tree
and
the
ceiling
do
try
to
remember
after
all
the
water
may
stop
it
must
find
its
level
there
i
think
it
is
stopping
no
no
oh
horrible
swim
swim
for
your
life
our
arms
became
entangled
in
the
effort
of
swimming
we
choked
we
fought
in
the
dark
water
already
we
could
hardly
breathe
the
dark
air
above
the
dark
water
the
air
which
escaped
which
we
could
hear
escaping
through
some
or
other
oh
let
us
turn
and
turn
and
turn
until
we
find
the
air
hole
and
then
glue
our
mouths
to
it
but
i
lost
my
strength
i
tried
to
lay
hold
of
the
walls
oh
how
those
glass
walls
slipped
from
under
my
groping
fingers
we
whirled
round
again
we
began
to
sink
one
last
effort
a
last
cry
erik
christine
guggle
guggle
guggle
in
our
ears
guggle
guggle
at
the
bottom
of
the
dark
water
our
ears
went
guggle
guggle
and
before
losing
consciousness
entirely
i
seemed
to
hear
between
two
guggles
barrels
barrels
any
barrels
to
sell
chapter
xxvi
the
end
of
the
ghost
love
story
the
previous
chapter
marks
the
conclusion
of
the
written
narrative
which
the
persian
left
behind
him
notwithstanding
the
horrors
of
a
situation
which
seemed
definitely
to
abandon
them
to
their
deaths
de
chagny
and
his
companion
were
saved
by
the
sublime
devotion
of
christine
daae
and
i
had
the
rest
of
the
story
from
the
lips
of
the
daroga
himself
when
i
went
to
see
him
he
was
still
living
in
his
little
flat
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
opposite
the
tuileries
he
was
very
ill
and
it
required
all
my
ardor
as
an
historian
pledged
to
the
truth
to
persuade
him
to
live
the
incredible
tragedy
over
again
for
my
benefit
his
faithful
old
servant
darius
showed
me
in
to
him
the
daroga
received
me
at
a
window
overlooking
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
he
still
had
his
magnificent
eyes
but
his
poor
face
looked
very
worn
he
had
shaved
the
whole
of
his
head
which
was
usually
covered
with
an
astrakhan
cap
he
was
dressed
in
a
long
plain
coat
and
amused
himself
by
unconsciously
twisting
his
thumbs
inside
the
sleeves
but
his
mind
was
quite
clear
and
he
told
me
his
story
with
perfect
lucidity
it
seems
that
when
he
opened
his
eyes
the
daroga
found
himself
lying
on
a
bed
de
chagny
was
on
a
sofa
beside
the
wardrobe
an
angel
and
a
devil
were
watching
over
them
after
the
deceptions
and
illusions
of
the
the
precision
of
the
details
of
that
quiet
little
room
seemed
to
have
been
invented
for
the
express
purpose
of
puzzling
the
mind
of
the
mortal
rash
enough
to
stray
into
that
abode
of
living
nightmare
the
wooden
bedstead
the
waxed
mahogany
chairs
the
chest
of
drawers
those
brasses
the
little
square
antimacassars
carefully
placed
on
the
backs
of
the
chairs
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
and
the
ebony
caskets
at
either
end
lastly
the
whatnot
filled
with
shells
with
red
with
boats
and
an
enormous
the
whole
discreetly
lighted
by
a
shaded
lamp
standing
on
a
small
round
table
this
collection
of
ugly
peaceable
reasonable
furniture
at
the
bottom
of
the
opera
cellars
bewildered
the
imagination
more
than
all
the
late
fantastic
happenings
and
the
figure
of
the
masked
man
seemed
all
the
more
formidable
in
this
neat
and
trim
little
frame
it
bent
down
over
the
persian
and
said
in
his
ear
are
you
better
daroga
you
are
looking
at
my
furniture
it
is
all
that
i
have
left
of
my
poor
unhappy
mother
christine
daae
did
not
say
a
word
she
moved
about
noiselessly
like
a
sister
of
charity
who
had
taken
a
vow
of
silence
she
brought
a
cup
of
cordial
or
of
hot
tea
he
did
not
remember
which
the
man
in
the
mask
took
it
from
her
hands
and
gave
it
to
the
persian
de
chagny
was
still
sleeping
erik
poured
a
drop
of
rum
into
the
daroga
cup
and
pointing
to
the
viscount
said
he
came
to
himself
long
before
we
knew
if
you
were
still
alive
daroga
he
is
quite
well
he
is
asleep
we
must
not
wake
him
erik
left
the
room
for
a
moment
and
the
persian
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
looked
around
him
and
saw
christine
daae
sitting
by
the
fireside
he
spoke
to
her
called
her
but
he
was
still
very
weak
and
fell
back
on
his
pillow
christine
came
to
him
laid
her
hand
on
his
forehead
and
went
away
again
and
the
persian
remembered
that
as
she
went
she
did
not
give
a
glance
at
de
chagny
who
it
is
true
was
sleeping
peacefully
and
she
sat
down
again
in
her
chair
by
the
silent
as
a
sister
of
charity
who
had
taken
a
vow
of
silence
erik
returned
with
some
little
bottles
which
he
placed
on
the
mantelpiece
and
again
in
a
whisper
so
as
not
to
wake
de
chagny
he
said
to
the
persian
after
sitting
down
and
feeling
his
pulse
you
are
now
saved
both
of
you
and
soon
i
shall
take
you
up
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
to
please
my
wife
thereupon
he
rose
without
any
further
explanation
and
disappeared
once
more
the
persian
now
looked
at
christine
quiet
profile
under
the
lamp
she
was
reading
a
tiny
book
with
gilt
edges
like
a
religious
book
there
are
editions
of
the
imitation
that
look
like
that
the
persian
still
had
in
his
ears
the
natural
tone
in
which
the
other
had
said
to
please
my
wife
very
gently
he
called
her
again
but
christine
was
wrapped
up
in
her
book
and
did
not
hear
him
erik
returned
mixed
the
daroga
a
draft
and
advised
him
not
to
speak
to
his
wife
again
nor
to
any
one
because
it
might
be
very
dangerous
to
everybody
health
eventually
the
persian
fell
asleep
like
de
chagny
and
did
not
wake
until
he
was
in
his
own
room
nursed
by
his
faithful
darius
who
told
him
that
on
the
night
before
he
was
found
propped
against
the
door
of
his
flat
where
he
had
been
brought
by
a
stranger
who
rang
the
bell
before
going
away
as
soon
as
the
daroga
recovered
his
strength
and
his
wits
he
sent
to
count
philippe
house
to
inquire
after
the
viscount
health
the
answer
was
that
the
young
man
had
not
been
seen
and
that
count
philippe
was
dead
his
body
was
found
on
the
bank
of
the
opera
lake
on
the
side
the
persian
remembered
the
requiem
mass
which
he
had
heard
from
behind
the
wall
of
the
and
had
no
doubt
concerning
the
crime
and
the
criminal
knowing
erik
as
he
did
he
easily
reconstructed
the
tragedy
thinking
that
his
brother
had
run
away
with
christine
daae
philippe
had
dashed
in
pursuit
of
him
along
the
brussels
road
where
he
knew
that
everything
was
prepared
for
the
elopement
failing
to
find
the
pair
he
hurried
back
to
the
opera
remembered
raoul
strange
confidence
about
his
fantastic
rival
and
learned
that
the
viscount
had
made
every
effort
to
enter
the
cellars
of
the
theater
and
that
he
had
disappeared
leaving
his
hat
in
the
prima
donna
beside
an
empty
and
the
count
who
no
longer
entertained
any
doubt
of
his
brother
madness
in
his
turn
darted
into
that
infernal
underground
maze
this
was
enough
in
the
persian
eyes
to
explain
the
discovery
of
the
comte
de
corpse
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
where
the
siren
erik
siren
kept
watch
the
persian
did
not
hesitate
he
determined
to
inform
the
police
now
the
case
was
in
the
hands
of
an
called
faure
an
incredulous
commonplace
superficial
sort
of
person
i
write
as
i
think
with
a
mind
utterly
unprepared
to
receive
a
confidence
of
this
kind
faure
took
down
the
daroga
depositions
and
proceeded
to
treat
him
as
a
madman
despairing
of
ever
obtaining
a
hearing
the
persian
sat
down
to
write
as
the
police
did
not
want
his
evidence
perhaps
the
press
would
be
glad
of
it
and
he
had
just
written
the
last
line
of
the
narrative
i
have
quoted
in
the
preceding
chapters
when
darius
announced
the
visit
of
a
stranger
who
refused
his
name
who
would
not
show
his
face
and
declared
simply
that
he
did
not
intend
to
leave
the
place
until
he
had
spoken
to
the
daroga
the
persian
at
once
felt
who
his
singular
visitor
was
and
ordered
him
to
be
shown
in
the
daroga
was
right
it
was
the
ghost
it
was
erik
he
looked
extremely
weak
and
leaned
against
the
wall
as
though
he
were
afraid
of
falling
taking
off
his
hat
he
revealed
a
forehead
white
as
wax
the
rest
of
the
horrible
face
was
hidden
by
the
mask
the
persian
rose
to
his
feet
as
erik
entered
murderer
of
count
philippe
what
have
you
done
with
his
brother
and
christine
daae
erik
staggered
under
this
direct
attack
kept
silent
for
a
moment
dragged
himself
to
a
chair
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
then
speaking
in
short
phrases
and
gasping
for
breath
between
the
words
daroga
do
talk
to
me
about
count
philippe
he
was
dead
by
the
time
i
left
my
house
he
was
dead
when
the
siren
sang
it
was
an
accident
a
sad
a
very
sad
accident
he
fell
very
awkwardly
but
simply
and
naturally
into
the
lake
you
lie
shouted
the
persian
erik
bowed
his
head
and
said
i
have
not
come
here
to
talk
about
count
philippe
but
to
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
die
where
are
raoul
de
chagny
and
christine
daae
i
am
going
to
die
raoul
de
chagny
and
christine
daae
of
love
daroga
i
am
dying
of
love
that
is
how
it
is
loved
her
so
and
i
love
her
still
daroga
and
i
am
dying
of
love
for
her
i
i
tell
you
if
you
knew
how
beautiful
she
was
when
she
let
me
kiss
her
alive
it
was
the
first
time
daroga
the
first
time
i
ever
kissed
a
woman
yes
alive
i
kissed
her
alive
and
she
looked
as
beautiful
as
if
she
had
been
dead
the
persian
shook
erik
by
the
arm
will
you
tell
me
if
she
is
alive
or
dead
why
do
you
shake
me
like
that
asked
erik
making
an
effort
to
speak
more
connectedly
i
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
die
yes
i
kissed
her
alive
and
now
she
is
dead
i
tell
you
i
kissed
her
just
like
that
on
her
forehead
and
she
did
not
draw
back
her
forehead
from
my
lips
oh
she
is
a
good
girl
as
to
her
being
dead
i
do
think
so
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
me
no
no
she
is
not
dead
and
no
one
shall
touch
a
hair
of
her
head
she
is
a
good
honest
girl
and
she
saved
your
life
daroga
at
a
moment
when
i
would
not
have
given
twopence
for
your
persian
skin
as
a
matter
of
fact
nobody
bothered
about
you
why
were
you
there
with
that
little
chap
you
would
have
died
as
well
as
he
my
word
how
she
entreated
me
for
her
little
chap
but
i
told
her
that
as
she
had
turned
the
scorpion
she
had
through
that
very
fact
and
of
her
own
free
will
become
engaged
to
me
and
that
she
did
not
need
to
have
two
men
engaged
to
her
which
was
true
enough
as
for
you
you
did
not
exist
you
had
ceased
to
exist
i
tell
you
and
you
were
going
to
die
with
the
other
only
mark
me
daroga
when
you
were
yelling
like
the
devil
because
of
the
water
christine
came
to
me
with
her
beautiful
blue
eyes
wide
open
and
swore
to
me
as
she
hoped
to
be
saved
that
she
consented
to
be
my
living
wife
until
then
in
the
depths
of
her
eyes
daroga
i
had
always
seen
my
dead
wife
it
was
the
first
time
i
saw
my
living
wife
there
she
was
sincere
as
she
hoped
to
be
saved
she
would
not
kill
herself
it
was
a
bargain
half
a
minute
later
all
the
water
was
back
in
the
lake
and
i
had
a
hard
job
with
you
daroga
for
upon
my
honor
i
thought
you
were
done
for
however
there
you
were
it
was
understood
that
i
was
to
take
you
both
up
to
the
surface
of
the
earth
when
at
last
i
cleared
the
room
of
you
i
came
back
alone
what
have
you
done
with
the
vicomte
de
chagny
asked
the
persian
interrupting
him
ah
you
see
daroga
i
could
carry
him
up
like
that
at
once
he
was
a
hostage
but
i
could
not
keep
him
in
the
house
on
the
lake
either
because
of
christine
so
i
locked
him
up
comfortably
i
chained
him
up
nicely
a
whiff
of
the
mazenderan
scent
had
left
him
as
limp
as
a
rag
in
the
communists
dungeon
which
is
in
the
most
deserted
and
remote
part
of
the
opera
below
the
fifth
cellar
where
no
one
ever
comes
and
where
no
one
ever
hears
you
then
i
came
back
to
christine
she
was
waiting
for
me
erik
here
rose
solemnly
then
he
continued
but
as
he
spoke
he
was
overcome
by
all
his
former
emotion
and
began
to
tremble
like
a
leaf
yes
she
was
waiting
for
me
waiting
for
me
erect
and
alive
a
real
living
bride
as
she
hoped
to
be
saved
and
when
i
came
forward
more
timid
than
a
little
child
she
did
not
run
away
no
no
she
stayed
she
waited
for
me
i
even
believe
daroga
that
she
put
out
her
forehead
a
little
oh
not
much
just
a
little
like
a
living
bride
and
and
i
kissed
her
i
i
i
and
she
did
not
die
oh
how
good
it
is
daroga
to
kiss
somebody
on
the
forehead
you
tell
but
i
i
my
mother
daroga
my
poor
unhappy
mother
would
never
let
me
kiss
her
she
used
to
run
away
and
throw
me
my
mask
nor
any
other
woman
ever
ever
ah
you
can
understand
my
happiness
was
so
great
i
cried
and
i
fell
at
her
feet
crying
and
i
kissed
her
feet
her
little
feet
crying
you
crying
too
daroga
and
she
cried
also
the
angel
cried
erik
sobbed
aloud
and
the
persian
himself
could
not
retain
his
tears
in
the
presence
of
that
masked
man
who
with
his
shoulders
shaking
and
his
hands
clutched
at
his
chest
was
moaning
with
pain
and
love
by
turns
yes
daroga
i
felt
her
tears
flow
on
my
forehead
on
mine
mine
they
were
soft
they
were
sweet
they
trickled
under
my
mask
they
mingled
with
my
tears
in
my
eyes
yes
they
flowed
between
my
lips
listen
daroga
listen
to
what
i
did
i
tore
off
my
mask
so
as
not
to
lose
one
of
her
tears
and
she
did
not
run
away
and
she
did
not
die
she
remained
alive
weeping
over
me
with
me
we
cried
together
i
have
tasted
all
the
happiness
the
world
can
offer
and
erik
fell
into
a
chair
choking
for
breath
ah
i
am
not
going
to
die
yet
presently
i
shall
but
let
me
cry
listen
daroga
listen
to
this
while
i
was
at
her
feet
i
heard
her
say
unhappy
erik
and
she
took
my
hand
i
had
become
no
more
you
know
than
a
poor
dog
ready
to
die
for
her
i
mean
it
daroga
i
held
in
my
hand
a
ring
a
plain
gold
ring
which
i
had
given
her
which
she
had
lost
and
which
i
had
found
again
a
you
know
i
slipped
it
into
her
little
hand
and
said
take
it
take
it
for
you
and
him
it
shall
be
my
a
present
from
your
poor
unhappy
erik
i
know
you
love
the
boy
do
cry
any
more
she
asked
me
in
a
very
soft
voice
what
i
meant
then
i
made
her
understand
that
where
she
was
concerned
i
was
only
a
poor
dog
ready
to
die
for
her
but
that
she
could
marry
the
young
man
when
she
pleased
because
she
had
cried
with
me
and
mingled
her
tears
with
mine
erik
emotion
was
so
great
that
he
had
to
tell
the
persian
not
to
look
at
him
for
he
was
choking
and
must
take
off
his
mask
the
daroga
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
his
heart
was
full
of
pity
but
he
took
care
to
keep
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
trees
in
the
tuileries
gardens
lest
he
should
see
the
monster
face
i
went
and
released
the
young
man
erik
continued
and
told
him
to
come
with
me
to
christine
they
kissed
before
me
in
the
room
christine
had
my
ring
i
made
christine
swear
to
come
back
one
night
when
i
was
dead
crossing
the
lake
from
the
side
and
bury
me
in
the
greatest
secrecy
with
the
gold
ring
which
she
was
to
wear
until
that
moment
i
told
her
where
she
would
find
my
body
and
what
to
do
with
it
then
christine
kissed
me
for
the
first
time
herself
here
on
the
forehead
do
look
daroga
here
on
the
forehead
on
my
forehead
mine
do
look
daroga
and
they
went
off
together
christine
had
stopped
crying
i
alone
cried
daroga
daroga
if
christine
keeps
her
promise
she
will
come
back
soon
the
persian
asked
him
no
questions
he
was
quite
reassured
as
to
the
fate
of
raoul
chagny
and
christine
daae
no
one
could
have
doubted
the
word
of
the
weeping
erik
that
night
the
monster
resumed
his
mask
and
collected
his
strength
to
leave
the
daroga
he
told
him
that
when
he
felt
his
end
to
be
very
near
at
hand
he
would
send
him
in
gratitude
for
the
kindness
which
the
persian
had
once
shown
him
that
which
he
held
dearest
in
the
world
all
christine
daae
papers
which
she
had
written
for
raoul
benefit
and
left
with
erik
together
with
a
few
objects
belonging
to
her
such
as
a
pair
of
gloves
a
and
two
in
reply
to
the
persian
questions
erik
told
him
that
the
two
young
people
at
soon
as
they
found
themselves
free
had
resolved
to
go
and
look
for
a
priest
in
some
lonely
spot
where
they
could
hide
their
happiness
and
that
with
this
object
in
view
they
had
started
from
the
northern
railway
station
of
the
world
lastly
erik
relied
on
the
persian
as
soon
as
he
received
the
promised
relics
and
papers
to
inform
the
young
couple
of
his
death
and
to
advertise
it
in
the
epoque
that
was
all
the
persian
saw
erik
to
the
door
of
his
flat
and
darius
helped
him
down
to
the
street
a
cab
was
waiting
for
him
erik
stepped
in
and
the
persian
who
had
gone
back
to
the
window
heard
him
say
to
the
driver
go
to
the
opera
and
the
cab
drove
off
into
the
night
the
persian
had
seen
the
poor
unfortunate
erik
for
the
last
time
three
weeks
later
the
epoque
published
this
advertisement
erik
is
dead
epilogue
i
have
now
told
the
singular
but
veracious
story
of
the
opera
ghost
as
i
declared
on
the
first
page
of
this
work
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
deny
that
erik
really
lived
there
are
so
many
proofs
of
his
existence
within
the
reach
of
everybody
that
we
can
follow
actions
logically
through
the
whole
tragedy
of
the
chagnys
there
is
no
need
to
repeat
here
how
greatly
the
case
excited
the
capital
the
kidnapping
of
the
artist
the
death
of
the
comte
de
chagny
under
such
exceptional
conditions
the
disappearance
of
his
brother
the
drugging
of
the
at
the
opera
and
of
his
two
assistants
what
tragedies
what
passions
what
crimes
had
surrounded
the
idyll
of
raoul
and
the
sweet
and
charming
christine
what
had
become
of
that
wonderful
mysterious
artist
of
whom
the
world
was
never
never
to
hear
again
she
was
represented
as
the
victim
of
a
rivalry
between
the
two
brothers
and
nobody
suspected
what
had
really
happened
nobody
understood
that
as
raoul
and
christine
had
both
disappeared
both
had
withdrawn
far
from
the
world
to
enjoy
a
happiness
which
they
would
not
have
cared
to
make
public
after
the
inexplicable
death
of
count
philippe
they
took
the
train
one
day
from
the
northern
railway
station
of
the
world
possibly
i
too
shall
take
the
train
at
that
station
one
day
and
go
and
seek
around
thy
lakes
o
norway
o
silent
scandinavia
for
the
perhaps
still
living
traces
of
raoul
and
christine
and
also
of
mamma
valerius
who
disappeared
at
the
same
time
possibly
some
day
i
shall
hear
the
lonely
echoes
of
the
north
repeat
the
singing
of
her
who
knew
the
angel
of
music
long
after
the
case
was
pigeonholed
by
the
unintelligent
care
of
le
juge
faure
the
newspapers
made
efforts
at
intervals
to
fathom
the
mystery
one
evening
paper
alone
which
knew
all
the
gossip
of
the
theaters
said
we
recognize
the
touch
of
the
opera
ghost
and
even
that
was
written
by
way
of
irony
the
persian
alone
knew
the
whole
truth
and
held
the
main
proofs
which
came
to
him
with
the
pious
relics
promised
by
the
ghost
it
fell
to
my
lot
to
complete
those
proofs
with
the
aid
of
the
daroga
himself
day
by
day
i
kept
him
informed
of
the
progress
of
my
inquiries
and
he
directed
them
he
had
not
been
to
the
opera
for
years
and
years
but
he
had
preserved
the
most
accurate
recollection
of
the
building
and
there
was
no
better
guide
than
he
possible
to
help
me
discover
its
most
secret
recesses
he
also
told
me
where
to
gather
further
information
whom
to
ask
and
he
sent
me
to
call
on
poligny
at
a
moment
when
the
poor
man
was
nearly
drawing
his
last
breath
i
had
no
idea
that
he
was
so
very
ill
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
effect
which
my
questions
about
the
ghost
produced
upon
him
he
looked
at
me
as
if
i
were
the
devil
and
answered
only
in
a
few
incoherent
sentences
which
showed
however
and
that
was
the
main
thing
the
extent
of
the
perturbation
which
in
his
time
had
brought
into
that
already
very
restless
life
for
poligny
was
what
people
call
a
man
of
pleasure
when
i
came
and
told
the
persian
of
the
poor
result
of
my
visit
to
poligny
the
daroga
gave
a
faint
smile
and
said
poligny
never
knew
how
far
that
extraordinary
blackguard
of
an
erik
humbugged
him
the
persian
by
the
way
spoke
of
erik
sometimes
as
a
demigod
and
sometimes
as
the
lowest
of
the
low
poligny
was
superstitious
and
erik
knew
it
erik
knew
most
things
about
the
public
and
private
affairs
of
the
opera
when
poligny
heard
a
mysterious
voice
tell
him
in
box
five
of
the
manner
in
which
he
used
to
spend
his
time
and
abuse
his
partner
confidence
he
did
not
wait
to
hear
any
more
thinking
at
first
that
it
was
a
voice
from
heaven
he
believed
himself
damned
and
then
when
the
voice
began
to
ask
for
money
he
saw
that
he
was
being
victimized
by
a
shrewd
blackmailer
to
whom
debienne
himself
had
fallen
a
prey
both
of
them
already
tired
of
management
for
various
reasons
went
away
without
trying
to
investigate
further
into
the
personality
of
that
curious
who
had
forced
such
a
singular
upon
them
they
bequeathed
the
whole
mystery
to
their
successors
and
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
when
they
were
rid
of
a
business
that
had
puzzled
them
without
amusing
them
in
the
least
i
then
spoke
of
the
two
successors
and
expressed
my
surprise
that
in
his
memoirs
of
a
manager
moncharmin
should
describe
the
opera
ghost
behavior
at
such
length
in
the
first
part
of
the
book
and
hardly
mention
it
at
all
in
the
second
in
reply
to
this
the
persian
who
knew
the
memoirs
as
thoroughly
as
if
he
had
written
them
himself
observed
that
i
should
find
the
explanation
of
the
whole
business
if
i
would
just
recollect
the
few
lines
which
moncharmin
devotes
to
the
ghost
in
the
second
part
aforesaid
i
quote
these
lines
which
are
particularly
interesting
because
they
describe
the
very
simple
manner
in
which
the
famous
incident
of
the
francs
was
closed
as
for
some
of
whose
curious
tricks
i
have
related
in
the
first
part
of
my
memoirs
i
will
only
say
that
he
redeemed
by
one
spontaneous
fine
action
all
the
worry
which
he
had
caused
my
dear
friend
and
partner
and
i
am
bound
to
say
myself
he
felt
no
doubt
that
there
are
limits
to
a
joke
especially
when
it
is
so
expensive
and
when
the
commissary
of
police
has
been
informed
for
at
the
moment
when
we
had
made
an
appointment
in
our
office
with
mifroid
to
tell
him
the
whole
story
a
few
days
after
the
disappearance
of
christine
daae
we
found
on
richard
table
a
large
envelope
inscribed
in
red
ink
with
compliments
it
contained
the
large
sum
of
money
which
he
had
succeeded
in
playfully
extracting
for
the
time
being
from
the
treasury
richard
was
at
once
of
the
opinion
that
we
must
be
content
with
that
and
drop
the
business
i
agreed
with
richard
all
well
that
ends
well
what
do
you
say
o
of
course
moncharmin
especially
after
the
money
had
been
restored
continued
to
believe
that
he
had
for
a
short
while
been
the
butt
of
richard
sense
of
humor
whereas
richard
on
his
side
was
convinced
that
moncharmin
had
amused
himself
by
inventing
the
whole
of
the
affair
of
the
opera
ghost
in
order
to
revenge
himself
for
a
few
jokes
i
asked
the
persian
to
tell
me
by
what
trick
the
ghost
had
taken
francs
from
richard
pocket
in
spite
of
the
he
replied
that
he
had
not
gone
into
this
little
detail
but
that
if
i
myself
cared
to
make
an
investigation
on
the
spot
i
should
certainly
find
the
solution
to
the
riddle
in
the
office
by
remembering
that
erik
had
not
been
nicknamed
the
lover
for
nothing
i
promised
the
persian
to
do
so
as
soon
as
i
had
time
and
i
may
as
well
tell
the
reader
at
once
that
the
results
of
my
investigation
were
perfectly
satisfactory
and
i
hardly
believed
that
i
should
ever
discover
so
many
undeniable
proofs
of
the
authenticity
of
the
feats
ascribed
to
the
ghost
the
persian
manuscript
christine
daae
papers
the
statements
made
to
me
by
the
people
who
used
to
work
under
mm
richard
and
moncharmin
by
little
meg
herself
the
worthy
madame
giry
i
am
sorry
to
say
is
no
more
and
by
sorelli
who
is
now
living
in
retirement
at
louveciennes
all
the
documents
relating
to
the
existence
of
the
ghost
which
i
propose
to
deposit
in
the
archives
of
the
opera
have
been
checked
and
confirmed
by
a
number
of
important
discoveries
of
which
i
am
justly
proud
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
the
house
on
the
lake
erik
having
blocked
up
all
the
secret
entrances
on
the
other
hand
i
have
discovered
the
secret
passage
of
the
communists
the
planking
of
which
is
falling
to
pieces
in
parts
and
also
the
through
which
raoul
and
the
persian
penetrated
into
the
cellars
of
the
in
the
communists
dungeon
i
noticed
numbers
of
initials
traced
on
the
walls
by
the
unfortunate
people
confined
in
it
and
among
these
were
an
r
and
a
raoul
de
chagny
the
letters
are
there
to
this
day
if
the
reader
will
visit
the
opera
one
morning
and
ask
leave
to
stroll
where
he
pleases
without
being
accompanied
by
a
stupid
guide
let
him
go
to
box
five
and
knock
with
his
fist
or
stick
on
the
enormous
column
that
separates
this
from
the
he
will
find
that
the
column
sounds
hollow
after
that
do
not
be
astonished
by
the
suggestion
that
it
was
occupied
by
the
voice
of
the
ghost
there
is
room
inside
the
column
for
two
men
if
you
are
surprised
that
when
the
various
incidents
occurred
no
one
turned
round
to
look
at
the
column
you
must
remember
that
it
presented
the
appearance
of
solid
marble
and
that
the
voice
contained
in
it
seemed
rather
to
come
from
the
opposite
side
for
as
we
have
seen
the
ghost
was
an
expert
ventriloquist
the
column
was
elaborately
carved
and
decorated
with
the
chisel
and
i
do
not
despair
of
one
day
discovering
the
ornament
that
could
be
raised
or
lowered
at
will
so
as
to
admit
of
the
mysterious
correspondence
with
mme
giry
and
of
his
generosity
however
all
these
discoveries
are
nothing
to
my
mind
compared
with
that
which
i
was
able
to
make
in
the
presence
of
the
in
the
managers
office
within
a
couple
of
inches
from
the
and
which
consisted
of
a
the
width
of
a
board
in
the
flooring
and
the
length
of
a
man
and
no
longer
a
that
falls
back
like
the
lid
of
a
box
a
through
which
i
can
see
a
hand
come
and
dexterously
fumble
at
the
pocket
of
a
coat
that
is
the
way
the
francs
went
and
that
also
is
the
way
by
which
through
some
trick
or
other
they
were
returned
speaking
about
this
to
the
persian
i
said
so
we
may
take
it
as
the
francs
were
returned
that
erik
was
simply
amusing
himself
with
that
of
his
do
you
believe
it
he
replied
erik
wanted
money
thinking
himself
without
the
pale
of
humanity
he
was
restrained
by
no
scruples
and
he
employed
his
extraordinary
gifts
of
dexterity
and
imagination
which
he
had
received
by
way
of
compensation
for
his
extraordinary
uglinesss
to
prey
upon
his
his
reason
for
restoring
the
francs
of
his
own
accord
was
that
he
no
longer
wanted
it
he
had
relinquished
his
marriage
with
christine
daae
he
had
relinquished
everything
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
according
to
the
persian
account
erik
was
born
in
a
small
town
not
far
from
rouen
he
was
the
son
of
a
he
ran
away
at
an
early
age
from
his
father
house
where
his
ugliness
was
a
subject
of
horror
and
terror
to
his
parents
for
a
time
he
frequented
the
fairs
where
a
showman
exhibited
him
as
the
living
corpse
he
seems
to
have
crossed
the
whole
of
europe
from
fair
to
fair
and
to
have
completed
his
strange
education
as
an
artist
and
magician
at
the
very
of
art
and
magic
among
the
gipsies
a
period
of
life
remained
quite
obscure
he
was
seen
at
the
fair
of
where
he
displayed
himself
in
all
his
hideous
glory
he
already
sang
as
nobody
on
this
earth
had
ever
sung
before
he
practised
ventriloquism
and
gave
displays
of
legerdemain
so
extraordinary
that
the
caravans
returning
to
asia
talked
about
it
during
the
whole
length
of
their
journey
in
this
way
his
reputation
penetrated
the
walls
of
the
palace
at
mazenderan
where
the
little
sultana
the
favorite
of
the
was
boring
herself
to
death
a
dealer
in
furs
returning
to
samarkand
from
told
of
the
marvels
which
he
had
seen
performed
in
erik
tent
the
trader
was
summoned
to
the
palace
and
the
daroga
of
mazenderan
was
told
to
question
him
next
the
daroga
was
instructed
to
go
and
find
erik
he
brought
him
to
persia
where
for
some
months
erik
will
was
law
he
was
guilty
of
not
a
few
horrors
for
he
seemed
not
to
know
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
he
took
part
calmly
in
a
number
of
political
assassinations
and
he
turned
his
diabolical
inventive
powers
against
the
emir
of
afghanistan
who
was
at
war
with
the
persian
empire
the
shah
took
a
liking
to
him
this
was
the
time
of
the
rosy
hours
of
mazenderan
of
which
the
daroga
narrative
has
given
us
a
glimpse
erik
had
very
original
ideas
on
the
subject
of
architecture
and
thought
out
a
palace
much
as
a
conjuror
contrives
a
the
shah
ordered
him
to
construct
an
edifice
of
this
kind
erik
did
so
and
the
building
appears
to
have
been
so
ingenious
that
his
majesty
was
able
to
move
about
in
it
unseen
and
to
disappear
without
a
possibility
of
the
trick
being
discovered
when
the
found
himself
the
possessor
of
this
gem
he
ordered
erik
yellow
eyes
to
be
put
out
but
he
reflected
that
even
when
blind
erik
would
still
be
able
to
build
so
remarkable
a
house
for
another
sovereign
and
also
that
as
long
as
erik
was
alive
some
one
would
know
the
secret
of
the
wonderful
palace
erik
death
was
decided
upon
together
with
that
of
all
the
laborers
who
had
worked
under
his
orders
the
execution
of
this
abominable
decree
devolved
upon
the
daroga
of
mazenderan
erik
had
shown
him
some
slight
services
and
procured
him
many
a
hearty
laugh
he
saved
erik
by
providing
him
with
the
means
of
escape
but
nearly
paid
with
his
head
for
his
generous
indulgence
fortunately
for
the
daroga
a
corpse
by
the
birds
of
prey
was
found
on
the
shore
of
the
caspian
sea
and
was
taken
for
body
because
the
daroga
friends
had
dressed
the
remains
in
clothing
that
belonged
to
erik
the
daroga
was
let
off
with
the
loss
of
the
imperial
favor
the
confiscation
of
his
property
and
an
order
of
perpetual
banishment
as
a
member
of
the
royal
house
however
he
continued
to
receive
a
monthly
pension
of
a
few
hundred
francs
from
the
persian
treasury
and
on
this
he
came
to
live
in
paris
as
for
erik
he
went
to
asia
minor
and
thence
to
constantinople
where
he
entered
the
sultan
employment
in
explanation
of
the
services
which
he
was
able
to
render
a
monarch
haunted
by
perpetual
terrors
i
need
only
say
that
it
was
erik
who
constructed
all
the
famous
and
secret
chambers
and
mysterious
which
were
found
at
after
the
last
turkish
revolution
he
also
invented
those
automata
dressed
like
the
sultan
and
resembling
the
sultan
in
all
respects
which
made
people
believe
that
the
commander
of
the
faithful
was
awake
at
one
place
when
in
reality
he
was
asleep
elsewhere
of
course
he
had
to
leave
the
sultan
service
for
the
same
reasons
that
made
him
fly
from
persia
he
knew
too
much
then
tired
of
his
adventurous
formidable
and
monstrous
life
he
longed
to
be
some
one
like
everybody
else
and
he
became
a
contractor
like
any
ordinary
contractor
building
ordinary
houses
with
ordinary
bricks
he
tendered
for
part
of
the
foundations
in
the
opera
his
estimate
was
accepted
when
he
found
himself
in
the
cellars
of
the
enormous
playhouse
his
artistic
fantastic
wizard
nature
resumed
the
upper
hand
besides
was
he
not
as
ugly
as
ever
he
dreamed
of
creating
for
his
own
use
a
dwelling
unknown
to
the
rest
of
the
earth
where
he
could
hide
from
men
eyes
for
all
time
the
reader
knows
and
guesses
the
rest
it
is
all
in
keeping
with
this
incredible
and
yet
veracious
story
poor
unhappy
erik
shall
we
pity
him
shall
we
curse
him
he
asked
only
to
be
some
one
like
everybody
else
but
he
was
too
ugly
and
he
had
to
hide
his
genius
or
use
it
to
play
tricks
with
when
with
an
ordinary
face
he
would
have
been
one
of
the
most
distinguished
of
mankind
he
had
a
heart
that
could
have
held
the
empire
of
the
world
and
in
the
end
he
had
to
content
himself
with
a
cellar
ah
yes
we
must
needs
pity
the
opera
ghost
i
have
prayed
over
his
mortal
remains
that
god
might
show
him
mercy
notwithstanding
his
crimes
yes
i
am
sure
quite
sure
that
i
prayed
beside
his
body
the
other
day
when
they
took
it
from
the
spot
where
they
were
burying
the
phonographic
records
it
was
his
skeleton
i
did
not
recognize
it
by
the
ugliness
of
the
head
for
all
men
are
ugly
when
they
have
been
dead
as
long
as
that
but
by
the
plain
gold
ring
which
he
wore
and
which
christine
daae
had
certainly
slipped
on
his
finger
when
she
came
to
bury
him
in
accordance
with
her
promise
the
skeleton
was
lying
near
the
little
well
in
the
place
where
the
angel
of
music
first
held
christine
daae
fainting
in
his
trembling
arms
on
the
night
when
he
carried
her
down
to
the
cellars
of
the
and
now
what
do
they
mean
to
do
with
that
skeleton
surely
they
will
not
bury
it
in
the
common
grave
i
say
that
the
place
of
the
skeleton
of
the
opera
ghost
is
in
the
archives
of
the
national
academy
of
music
it
is
no
ordinary
skeleton
even
so
i
am
convinced
that
it
would
be
easy
to
reach
it
by
draining
the
lake
as
i
have
repeatedly
requested
the
ministry
of
fine
arts
to
do
i
was
speaking
about
it
to
the
for
fine
arts
only
hours
before
the
publication
of
this
book
who
knows
but
that
the
score
of
don
juan
triumphant
might
yet
be
discovered
in
the
house
on
the
lake
see
the
interview
of
the
special
correspondent
of
the
matin
with
bey
on
the
day
after
the
entry
of
the
salonika
troops
into
constantinople
the
end
the
paris
opera
house
the
scene
of
gaston
leroux
novel
the
phantom
of
the
opera
that
leroux
has
used
for
the
scene
of
his
story
the
paris
opera
house
as
it
really
is
and
has
not
created
a
building
out
of
his
imagination
is
shown
by
this
interesting
description
of
it
taken
from
an
article
which
appeared
in
scribner
magazine
in
a
short
time
after
the
building
was
completed
the
new
opera
house
commenced
under
the
empire
and
finished
under
the
republic
is
the
most
complete
building
of
the
kind
in
the
world
and
in
many
respects
the
most
beautiful
no
european
capital
possesses
an
opera
house
so
comprehensive
in
plan
and
execution
and
none
can
boast
an
edifice
equally
vast
and
splendid
the
site
of
the
opera
house
was
chosen
in
it
was
determined
to
lay
the
foundation
exceptionally
deep
and
strong
it
was
well
known
that
water
would
be
met
with
but
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
at
what
depth
or
in
what
quantity
it
would
be
found
exceptional
depth
also
was
necessary
as
the
stage
arrangements
were
to
be
such
as
to
admit
a
scene
fifty
feet
high
to
be
lowered
on
its
frame
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
lay
a
foundation
in
a
soil
soaked
with
water
which
should
be
sufficiently
solid
to
sustain
a
weight
of
pounds
and
at
the
same
time
to
be
perfectly
dry
as
the
cellars
were
intended
for
the
storage
of
scenery
and
properties
while
the
work
was
in
progress
the
excavation
was
kept
free
from
water
by
means
of
eight
pumps
worked
by
steam
power
and
in
operation
without
interruption
day
and
night
from
march
second
to
october
thirteenth
the
floor
of
the
cellar
was
covered
with
a
layer
of
concrete
then
with
two
coats
of
cement
another
layer
of
concrete
and
a
coat
of
bitumen
the
wall
includes
an
outer
wall
built
as
a
a
brick
wall
a
coat
of
cement
and
a
wall
proper
a
little
over
a
yard
thick
after
all
this
was
done
the
whole
was
filled
with
water
in
order
that
the
fluid
by
penetrating
into
the
most
minute
interstices
might
deposit
a
sediment
which
would
close
them
more
surely
and
perfectly
than
it
would
be
possible
to
do
by
hand
twelve
years
elapsed
before
the
completion
of
the
building
and
during
that
time
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
precautions
taken
secured
absolute
impermeability
and
solidity
the
events
of
interrupted
work
just
as
it
was
about
to
be
prosecuted
most
vigorously
and
the
new
opera
house
was
put
to
new
and
unexpected
uses
during
the
siege
it
was
converted
into
a
vast
military
storehouse
and
filled
with
a
heterogeneous
mass
of
goods
after
the
siege
the
building
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
commune
and
the
roof
was
turned
into
a
balloon
station
the
damage
done
however
was
slight
the
fine
stone
employed
in
the
construction
was
brought
from
quarries
in
sweden
scotland
italy
algeria
finland
spain
belgium
and
france
while
work
on
the
exterior
was
in
progress
the
building
was
covered
in
by
a
wooden
shell
rendered
transparent
by
thousands
of
small
panes
of
glass
in
a
swarm
of
men
supplied
with
hammers
and
axes
stripped
the
house
of
its
habit
and
showed
in
all
its
splendor
the
great
structure
no
picture
can
do
justice
to
the
rich
colors
of
the
edifice
or
to
the
harmonious
tone
resulting
from
the
skilful
use
of
many
diverse
materials
the
effect
of
the
frontage
is
completed
by
the
cupola
of
the
auditorium
topped
with
a
cap
of
bronze
sparingly
adorned
with
gilding

having
climbed
ten

and
left
behind
him
a

before
entering
the

traverse
a
large
circular
vestibule
located
exactly
beneath
it
the
ceiling
of
this
portion
of
the
building
is
upheld
by
sixteen
fluted
columns
of

with
white

forming
a

here

are
summoned
the
third

which
is
quite
distinct

is
reserved
for
the
executive
the
section
of
the
building
set
aside
for
the
use
of
the
emperor
napoleon
was
to
have
included
an
antechamber
for

a

besides
a
salon
for
fifteen

thus
arrangements
had
to
be
made
to
accommodate
in
this
part
of
the
building
about
one
hundred
persons
fifty
horses
and
carriages
the
fall
of
the
empire
suggested
some
changes
but
ample
provision
still
exists
for
emergencies
its
novel
conception
perfect
fitness
and
rare
splendor
of
material
make
the
grand
stairway
unquestionably
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
of
the
building
it
presents
to
the
spectator
who
has
just
passed
through
the

pavilion
a
gorgeous
picture
from
this

he
beholds
the

more
than
fifty

had
to
be
extracted
from

to
find
thirty
perfect
monoliths
the
foyer
de
la
danse
has
particular
interest
for
the
habitues
of
the
opera
it
is
a
place
of
reunion
to
which
subscribers
to
three
performances
a
week
are
admitted
between
the

immense
cover
the

the

include
twenty
oval
medallions
in

while
the

receive
their
admirers
in
this
foyer
they
can
practise
their
steps
bars
have
to
this
end
been
secured
at
convenient
points
and
the
floor
has
been
given
the
same
slope
as
that
of
the
stage
so
that
the
labor
expended
may
be
thoroughly
profitable
to
the
performance
the
singers
foyer
on
the
same
floor
is
a
much
less
lively
resort
than
the
foyer
de
la
danse
as
vocalists
rarely
leave
their
before
they
are
summoned
to
the
stage
thirty
panels
with
portraits
of
the
artists
of
repute
in
the
annals
of
the
opera
adorn
this
foyer
some
estimate
may
be
arrived
at
by
sitting
before
the
concierge
an
hour
or
so
before
the
representation
commences
first
appear
the
stage

who
are
always
seventy
and
sometimes
when
for
example
with
its
ship
scene
is
the
opera
one
hundred

ten
strong
then
come
stage
upholsterers
whose
sole
duty
is
to

generally
who
seek
to
add
to
their
meagre
earnings
there
are
about
a
hundred
choristers
and
about
eighty
musicians
next
we
behold
equeries

horses
are
hoisted
on
the

of
an
elevator
electricians
