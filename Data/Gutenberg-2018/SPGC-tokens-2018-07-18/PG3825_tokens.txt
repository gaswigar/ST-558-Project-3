preface
to
pygmalion
a
professor
of
phonetics
as
will
be
seen
later
on
pygmalion
needs
not
a
preface
but
a
sequel
which
i
have
supplied
in
its
due
place
the
english
have
no
respect
for
their
language
and
will
not
teach
their
children
to
speak
it
they
spell
it
so
abominably
that
no
man
can
teach
himself
what
it
sounds
like
it
is
impossible
for
an
englishman
to
open
his
mouth
without
making
some
other
englishman
hate
or
despise
him
german
and
spanish
are
accessible
to
foreigners
english
is
not
accessible
even
to
englishmen
the
reformer
england
needs
today
is
an
energetic
phonetic
enthusiast
that
is
why
i
have
made
such
a
one
the
hero
of
a
popular
play
there
have
been
heroes
of
that
kind
crying
in
the
wilderness
for
many
years
past
when
i
became
interested
in
the
subject
towards
the
end
of
the
melville
bell
was
dead
but
alexander
ellis
was
still
a
living
patriarch
with
an
impressive
head
always
covered
by
a
velvet
skull
cap
for
which
he
would
apologize
to
public
meetings
in
a
very
courtly
manner
he
and
tito
pagliardini
another
phonetic
veteran
were
men
whom
it
was
impossible
to
dislike
henry
sweet
then
a
young
man
lacked
their
sweetness
of
character
he
was
about
as
conciliatory
to
conventional
mortals
as
ibsen
or
samuel
butler
his
great
ability
as
a
phonetician
he
was
i
think
the
best
of
them
all
at
his
job
would
have
entitled
him
to
high
official
recognition
and
perhaps
enabled
him
to
popularize
his
subject
but
for
his
satanic
contempt
for
all
academic
dignitaries
and
persons
in
general
who
thought
more
of
greek
than
of
phonetics
once
in
the
days
when
the
imperial
institute
rose
in
south
kensington
and
joseph
chamberlain
was
booming
the
empire
i
induced
the
editor
of
a
leading
monthly
review
to
commission
an
article
from
sweet
on
the
imperial
importance
of
his
subject
when
it
arrived
it
contained
nothing
but
a
savagely
derisive
attack
on
a
professor
of
language
and
literature
whose
chair
sweet
regarded
as
proper
to
a
phonetic
expert
only
the
article
being
libelous
had
to
be
returned
as
impossible
and
i
had
to
renounce
my
dream
of
dragging
its
author
into
the
limelight
when
i
met
him
afterwards
for
the
first
time
for
many
years
i
found
to
my
astonishment
that
he
who
had
been
a
quite
tolerably
presentable
young
man
had
actually
managed
by
sheer
scorn
to
alter
his
personal
appearance
until
he
had
become
a
sort
of
walking
repudiation
of
oxford
and
all
its
traditions
it
must
have
been
largely
in
his
own
despite
that
he
was
squeezed
into
something
called
a
readership
of
phonetics
there
the
future
of
phonetics
rests
probably
with
his
pupils
who
all
swore
by
him
but
nothing
could
bring
the
man
himself
into
any
sort
of
compliance
with
the
university
to
which
he
nevertheless
clung
by
divine
right
in
an
intensely
oxonian
way
i
daresay
his
papers
if
he
has
left
any
include
some
satires
that
may
be
published
without
too
destructive
results
fifty
years
hence
he
was
i
believe
not
in
the
least
an
man
very
much
the
opposite
i
should
say
but
he
would
not
suffer
fools
gladly
those
who
knew
him
will
recognize
in
my
third
act
the
allusion
to
the
patent
shorthand
in
which
he
used
to
write
postcards
and
which
may
be
acquired
from
a
four
and
manual
published
by
the
clarendon
press
the
postcards
which
higgins
describes
are
such
as
i
have
received
from
sweet
i
would
decipher
a
sound
which
a
cockney
would
represent
by
zerr
and
a
frenchman
by
seu
and
then
write
demanding
with
some
heat
what
on
earth
it
meant
sweet
with
boundless
contempt
for
my
stupidity
would
reply
that
it
not
only
meant
but
obviously
was
the
word
result
as
no
other
word
containing
that
sound
and
capable
of
making
sense
with
the
context
existed
in
any
language
spoken
on
earth
that
less
expert
mortals
should
require
fuller
indications
was
beyond
sweet
patience
therefore
though
the
whole
point
of
his
current
shorthand
is
that
it
can
express
every
sound
in
the
language
perfectly
vowels
as
well
as
consonants
and
that
your
hand
has
to
make
no
stroke
except
the
easy
and
current
ones
with
which
you
write
m
n
and
u
l
p
and
q
scribbling
them
at
whatever
angle
comes
easiest
to
you
his
unfortunate
determination
to
make
this
remarkable
and
quite
legible
script
serve
also
as
a
shorthand
reduced
it
in
his
own
practice
to
the
most
inscrutable
of
cryptograms
his
true
objective
was
the
provision
of
a
full
accurate
legible
script
for
our
noble
but
language
but
he
was
led
past
that
by
his
contempt
for
the
popular
pitman
system
of
shorthand
which
he
called
the
pitfall
system
the
triumph
of
pitman
was
a
triumph
of
business
organization
there
was
a
weekly
paper
to
persuade
you
to
learn
pitman
there
were
cheap
textbooks
and
exercise
books
and
transcripts
of
speeches
for
you
to
copy
and
schools
where
experienced
teachers
coached
you
up
to
the
necessary
proficiency
sweet
could
not
organize
his
market
in
that
fashion
he
might
as
well
have
been
the
sybil
who
tore
up
the
leaves
of
prophecy
that
nobody
would
attend
to
the
four
and
manual
mostly
in
his
lithographed
handwriting
that
was
never
vulgarly
advertized
may
perhaps
some
day
be
taken
up
by
a
syndicate
and
pushed
upon
the
public
as
the
times
pushed
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
but
until
then
it
will
certainly
not
prevail
against
pitman
i
have
bought
three
copies
of
it
during
my
lifetime
and
i
am
informed
by
the
publishers
that
its
cloistered
existence
is
still
a
steady
and
healthy
one
i
actually
learned
the
system
two
several
times
and
yet
the
shorthand
in
which
i
am
writing
these
lines
is
pitman
and
the
reason
is
that
my
secretary
can
not
transcribe
sweet
having
been
perforce
taught
in
the
schools
of
pitman
therefore
sweet
railed
at
pitman
as
vainly
as
thersites
railed
at
ajax
his
raillery
however
it
may
have
eased
his
soul
gave
no
popular
vogue
to
current
shorthand
pygmalion
higgins
is
not
a
portrait
of
sweet
to
whom
the
adventure
of
eliza
doolittle
would
have
been
impossible
still
as
will
be
seen
there
are
touches
of
sweet
in
the
play
with
higgins
physique
and
temperament
sweet
might
have
set
the
thames
on
fire
as
it
was
he
impressed
himself
professionally
on
europe
to
an
extent
that
made
his
comparative
personal
obscurity
and
the
failure
of
oxford
to
do
justice
to
his
eminence
a
puzzle
to
foreign
specialists
in
his
subject
i
do
not
blame
oxford
because
i
think
oxford
is
quite
right
in
demanding
a
certain
social
amenity
from
its
nurslings
heaven
knows
it
is
not
exorbitant
in
its
requirements
for
although
i
well
know
how
hard
it
is
for
a
man
of
genius
with
a
seriously
underrated
subject
to
maintain
serene
and
kindly
relations
with
the
men
who
underrate
it
and
who
keep
all
the
best
places
for
less
important
subjects
which
they
profess
without
originality
and
sometimes
without
much
capacity
for
them
still
if
he
overwhelms
them
with
wrath
and
disdain
he
can
not
expect
them
to
heap
honors
on
him
of
the
later
generations
of
phoneticians
i
know
little
among
them
towers
the
poet
laureate
to
whom
perhaps
higgins
may
owe
his
miltonic
sympathies
though
here
again
i
must
disclaim
all
portraiture
but
if
the
play
makes
the
public
aware
that
there
are
such
people
as
phoneticians
and
that
they
are
among
the
most
important
people
in
england
at
present
it
will
serve
its
turn
i
wish
to
boast
that
pygmalion
has
been
an
extremely
successful
play
all
over
europe
and
north
america
as
well
as
at
home
it
is
so
intensely
and
deliberately
didactic
and
its
subject
is
esteemed
so
dry
that
i
delight
in
throwing
it
at
the
heads
of
the
wiseacres
who
repeat
the
parrot
cry
that
art
should
never
be
didactic
it
goes
to
prove
my
contention
that
art
should
never
be
anything
else
finally
and
for
the
encouragement
of
people
troubled
with
accents
that
cut
them
off
from
all
high
employment
i
may
add
that
the
change
wrought
by
professor
higgins
in
the
flower
girl
is
neither
impossible
nor
uncommon
the
modern
concierge
daughter
who
fulfils
her
ambition
by
playing
the
queen
of
spain
in
ruy
blas
at
the
theatre
francais
is
only
one
of
many
thousands
of
men
and
women
who
have
sloughed
off
their
native
dialects
and
acquired
a
new
tongue
but
the
thing
has
to
be
done
scientifically
or
the
last
state
of
the
aspirant
may
be
worse
than
the
first
an
honest
and
natural
slum
dialect
is
more
tolerable
than
the
attempt
of
a
phonetically
untaught
person
to
imitate
the
vulgar
dialect
of
the
golf
club
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
our
academy
of
dramatic
art
there
is
still
too
much
sham
golfing
english
on
our
stage
and
too
little
of
the
noble
english
of
forbes
robertson
act
i
covent
garden
at
torrents
of
heavy
summer
rain
cab
whistles
blowing
frantically
in
all
directions
pedestrians
running
for
shelter
into
the
market
and
under
the
portico
of
paul
church
where
there
are
already
several
people
among
them
a
lady
and
her
daughter
in
evening
dress
they
are
all
peering
out
gloomily
at
the
rain
except
one
man
with
his
back
turned
to
the
rest
who
seems
wholly
preoccupied
with
a
notebook
in
which
he
is
writing
busily
the
church
clock
strikes
the
first
quarter
the
daughter
in
the
space
between
the
central
pillars
close
to
the
one

chilled
to
the
bone

he
have
done
poor

the
daughter
other
people

why
could
he
freddy
rushes
in
out
of
the
rain
from
the
southampton
street
side
and
comes
between
them
closing
a
dripping
umbrella
he
is
a
young
man
of
twenty
in
evening
dress
very
wet
around
the
ankles
the
daughter

helpless
freddy
go

and
come
back
until
you

freddy
i
shall
simply
get
soaked
for
nothing
the
daughter
and
what
about
us
are
we
to
stay
here
all
night
in
this
draught
with
next
to
nothing
on
you
selfish
pig
freddy
oh
very
well
i
go
i
go
he
opens
his
umbrella
and
dashes
off
strandwards
but
comes
into
collision
with
a
flower
girl
who
is
hurrying
in
for
shelter
knocking
her
basket
out
of
her
hands
a
blinding
flash
of
lightning
followed
instantly
by
a
rattling
peal
of
thunder
orchestrates
the
incident
the
flower
girl
nah
then
freddy
look
wh
y
gowin
deah
freddy
sorry
he
rushes
off
the
flower
girl
picking
up
her
scattered
flowers
and
replacing
them
in
the
basket
there
menners
f
yer
banches
o
voylets
trod
into
the
mad
she
sits
down
on
the
plinth
of
the
column
sorting
her
flowers
on
the
lady
right
she
is
not
at
all
an
attractive
person
she
is
perhaps
eighteen
perhaps
twenty
hardly
older
she
wears
a
little
sailor
hat
of
black
straw
that
has
long
been
exposed
to
the
dust
and
soot
of
london
and
has
seldom
if
ever
been
brushed
her
hair
needs
washing
rather
badly
its
mousy
color
can
hardly
be
natural
she
wears
a
shoddy
black
coat
that
reaches
nearly
to
her
knees
and
is
shaped
to
her
waist
she
has
a
brown
skirt
with
a
coarse
apron
her
boots
are
much
the
worse
for
wear
she
is
no
doubt
as
clean
as
she
can
afford
to
be
but
compared
to
the
ladies
she
is
very
dirty
her
features
are
no
worse
than
theirs
but
their
condition
leaves
something
to
be
desired
and
she
needs
the
services
of
a
dentist
the
mother
how

mamma
you
might

that
she
retreats
in
disgust
behind

pillar
an
elderly
gentleman
of
the
amiable
military
type
rushes
into
shelter
and
closes
a
dripping
umbrella
he
is
in
the
same
plight
as
freddy
very
wet
about
the
ankles
he
is
in
evening

goes
to
the
plinth
beside
the
flower
girl

up
his
foot
on
it
and
stoops
to
turn
down
his
trouser
ends
the
mother
oh
dear
she
retires
sadly
and
joins
her
daughter
the
flower
girl
taking
advantage
of
the
military
gentleman
proximity
to
establish
friendly
relations
with
him

pickering
is
seated
at
the
table
putting
down
some
cards
and
a
which
he
has
been
using
higgins
is
standing
up
near
him
closing
two
or
three
file
drawers
which
are
hanging
out
he
appears
in
the
morning
light
as
a
robust
vital
appetizing
sort
of
man
of
forty
or
thereabouts
dressed
in
a
black
with
a
white
linen
collar
and
black
silk
tie
he
is
of
the
energetic
scientific
type
heartily
even
violently
interested
in
everything
that
can
be
studied
as
a
scientific
subject
and
careless
about
himself
and
other
people
including
their
feelings
he
is
in
fact
but
for
his
years
and
size
rather
like
a
very
impetuous
baby
taking
notice
eagerly
and
loudly
and
requiring
almost
as
much
watching
to
keep
him
out
of
unintended
mischief
his
manner
varies
from
genial
bullying
when
he
is
in
a
good
humor
to
stormy
petulance
when
anything
goes
wrong
but
he
is
so
entirely
frank
and
void
of
malice
that
he
remains
likeable
even
in
his
least
reasonable
moments
higgins
as
he
shuts
the
last
drawer
well
i
think
that
the
whole
show
pickering
it
really
amazing
i
have
taken
half
of
it
in
you
know
higgins
would
you
like
to
go
over
any
of
it
again
pickering
rising
and
coming
to
the
fireplace
where
he
plants
himself
with
his
back
to
the
fire
no
thank
you
not
now
i
quite
done
up
for
this
morning
higgins
following
him
and
standing
beside
him
on
his
left
tired
of
listening
to
sounds
pickering
yes
it
a
fearful
strain
i
rather
fancied
myself
because
i
can
pronounce
distinct
vowel
sounds
but
your
hundred
and
thirty
beat
me
i
ca
hear
a
bit
of
difference
between
most
of
them
higgins
chuckling
and
going
over
to
the
piano
to
eat
sweets
oh
that
comes
with
practice
you
hear
no
difference
at
first
but
you
keep
on
listening
and
presently
you
find
they
all
as
different
as
a
from
b
pearce
looks
in
she
is
higgins
housekeeper
what
the
matter
pearce
hesitating
evidently
perplexed
a
young
woman
wants
to
see
you
sir
higgins
a
young
woman
what
does
she
want
pearce
well
sir
she
says
you
be
glad
to
see
her
when
you
know
what
she
come
about
she
quite
a
common
girl
sir
very
common
indeed
i
should
have
sent
her
away
only
i
thought
perhaps
you
wanted
her
to
talk
into
your
machines
i
hope
i
not
done
wrong
but
really
you
see
such
queer
people
sometimes
you
excuse
me
i
sure
sir
higgins
oh
that
all
right
pearce
has
she
an
interesting
accent
pearce
oh
something
dreadful
sir
really
i
do
know
how
you
can
take
an
interest
in
it
higgins
to
pickering
let
have
her
up
show
her
up
pearce
he
rushes
across
to
his
working
table
and
picks
out
a
cylinder
to
use
on
the
phonograph
pearce
only
half
resigned
to
it
very
well
sir
it
for
you
to
say
she
goes
downstairs
higgins
this
is
rather
a
bit
of
luck
i
show
you
how
i
make
records
we
set
her
talking
and
i
take
it
down
first
in
visible
speech
then
in
broad
romic
and
then
we
get
her
on
the
phonograph
so
that
you
can
turn
her
on
as
often
as
you
like
with
the
written
transcript
before
you
pearce
returning
this
is
the
young
woman
sir
the
flower
girl
enters
in
state
she
has
a
hat
with
three
ostrich
feathers
orange
and
red
she
has
a
nearly
clean
apron
and
the
shoddy
coat
has
been
tidied
a
little
the
pathos
of
this
deplorable
figure
with
its
innocent
vanity
and
consequential
air
touches
pickering
who
has
already
straightened
himself
in
the
presence
of
pearce
but
as
to
higgins
the
only
distinction
he
makes
between
men
and
women
is
that
when
he
is
neither
bullying
nor
exclaiming
to
the
heavens
against
some
featherweight
cross
he
coaxes
women
as
a
child
coaxes
its
nurse
when
it
wants
to
get
anything
out
of
her
higgins
brusquely
recognizing
her
with
unconcealed
disappointment
and
at
once
making
an
intolerable
grievance
of
it
why
this
is
the
girl
i
jotted
down
last
night
she
no
use
i
got
all
the
records
i

as
fully
equivalent

sixty

seventy
guineas

eliza
you

to
live
here

shuts
the
door
and
eliza
plaints
are
no
longer
audible
pickering
comes
from
the
hearth
to
the
chair
and
sits
astride
it
with
his
arms
on
the
back
pickering
excuse
the
straight
question
higgins
are
you
a
man
of
good
character
where
women
are
concerned
higgins
moodily
have
you
ever
met
a
man
of
good
character
where
women
are
concerned
pickering
yes
very
frequently
higgins
dogmatically
lifting
himself
on
his
hands
to
the
level
of
the
piano
and
sitting
on
it
with
a
bounce
well
i
have
i
find
that
the
moment
i
let
a
woman
make
friends
with
me
she
becomes
jealous
exacting
suspicious
and
a
damned
nuisance
i
find
that
the
moment
i
let
myself
make
friends
with
a
woman
i
become
selfish
and
tyrannical
women
upset
everything
when
you
let
them
into
your
life
you
find
that
the
woman
is
driving
at
one
thing
and
you
driving
at
another
pickering
at
what
for
example
higgins
coming
off
the
piano
restlessly
oh
lord
knows
i
suppose
the
woman
wants
to
live
her
own
life
and
the
man
wants
to
live
his
and
each
tries
to
drag
the
other
on
to
the
wrong
track
one
wants
to
go
north
and
the
other
south
and
the
result
is
that
both
have
to
go
east
though
they
both
hate
the
east
wind
he
sits
down
on
the
bench
at
the
keyboard
so
here
i
am
a
confirmed
old
bachelor
and
likely
to
remain
so
pickering
rising
and
standing
over
him
gravely
come
higgins
you
know
what
i
mean
if
i
to
be
in
this
business
i
shall
feel
responsible
for
that
girl
i
hope
it
understood
that
no
advantage
is
to
be
taken
of
her
position
higgins
what
that
thing
sacred
i
assure
you
rising
to
explain
you
see
she
be
a
pupil
and
teaching
would
be
impossible
unless
pupils
were
sacred
i
taught
scores
of
american
millionairesses
how
to
speak
english
the
best
looking
women
in
the
world
i
seasoned
they
might
as
well
be
blocks
of
wood
i
might
as
well
be
a
block
of
wood

oven
for
a
while
higgins
putting
it
down
hastily
on
the
piano
oh

very
particular

this
to
me
pearce
unmoved
no

at
all
particular
when

anything
or
when
you

a
little
impatient
now

before
me
i
used
to
it
but
you
really
must
not
swear
before
the
girl
higgins
indignantly
i
swear
most
emphatically
i
never
swear
i
detest
the
habit
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
pearce
stolidly
that
what
i
mean
sir
you
swear
a
great
deal
too
much
i
do
mind
your
damning
and
blasting
and
what
the
devil
and
where
the
devil
and
who
the
devil
higgins
really
pearce
this
language
from
your
lips
pearce
not
to
be
put
off
but
there
is
a
certain
word
i
must
ask
you
not
to
use
the
girl
has
just
used
it
herself
because
the
bath
was
too
hot
it
begins
with
the
same
letter
as
bath
she
knows
no
better
she
learnt
it
at
her
mother
knee
but
she
must
not
hear
it
from
your
lips
higgins
loftily
i
can
not
charge
myself
with
having
ever
uttered
it
pearce
she
looks
at
him
steadfastly
he
adds
hiding
an
uneasy
conscience
with
a
judicial
air
except
perhaps
in
a
moment
of
extreme
and
justifiable
excitement
pearce
only
this
morning
sir
you
applied
it
to
your
boots
to
the
butter
and
to
the
brown
bread
higgins
oh
that
mere
alliteration
pearce
natural
to
a
poet
pearce
well
sir
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
i
beg
you
not
to
let
the
girl
hear
you
repeat
it
higgins
oh
very
well
very
well
is
that
all
pearce
no
sir
we
shall
have
to
be
very
particular
with
this
girl
as
to
personal
cleanliness
higgins
certainly
quite
right
most
important
pearce
i
mean
not
to
be
slovenly
about
her
dress
or
untidy
in
leaving
things
about
higgins
going
to
her
solemnly
just
so
i
intended
to
call
your
attention
to
that
he
passes
on
to
pickering
who
is
enjoying
the
conversation
immensely
it
is
these
little
things
that
matter
pickering
take
care
of
the
pence
and
the
pounds
will
take
care
of
themselves
is
as
true
of
personal
habits
as
of
money
he
comes
to
anchor
on
the
hearthrug
with
the
air
of
a
man
in
an
unassailable
position
pearce
yes
sir
then
might
i
ask
you
not
to
come
down
to
breakfast
in
your
or
at
any
rate
not
to
use
it
as
a
napkin
to
the
extent
you
do
sir
and
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
not
to
eat
everything
off
the
same
plate
and
to
remember
not
to
put
the
porridge
saucepan
out
of
your
hand
on
the
clean
tablecloth
it
would
be
a
better
example
to
the
girl
you
know
you
nearly
choked
yourself
with
a
fishbone
in
the
jam
only
last
week
higgins
routed
from
the
hearthrug
and
drifting
back
to
the
piano
i
may
do
these
things
sometimes
in
absence
of
mind
but
surely
i
do
do
them
habitually
angrily
by
the
way
my
smells
most
damnably
of
benzine
pearce
no
doubt
it
does
higgins
but
if
you
will
wipe
your
fingers
higgins
yelling
oh

well
very
well

wipe
them
in
my
hair
in
future
pearce
i
hope
you
not
offended
higgins
higgins
shocked
at
finding
himself
thought
capable
of
an
unamiable
sentiment
not
at
all
not
at
all
you
quite
right
pearce
i
shall
be
particularly
careful
before

use
some
of
those
japanese
dresses

man

able
to
feel
really
and
tremendous
like
other
chaps
and
yet
she
firmly
persuaded
that
i
an
arbitrary
overbearing
bossing
kind
of
person
i
ca
account
for
it
pearce
returns
pearce
if
you

his
profession
including
a
hat
with
a
back
brim
covering
his
neck
and
shoulders
he
has
well
marked
and
rather
interesting
features
and
seems
equally
free
from
fear
and
conscience
he
has
a
remarkably
expressive
voice
the
result
of
a
habit
of
giving
vent
to
his
feelings
without
reserve
his
present
pose
is
that
of
wounded
honor
and
stern
resolution

doolittle
doolittle
to
pickering
i
thank
you
governor
to
higgins
who
takes
refuge
on
the
piano
bench
a
little
overwhelmed
by
the
proximity
of
his
visitor
for
doolittle
has
a
professional
flavor
of
dust
about
him
well
the
truth
is
i
taken
a
sort
of
fancy
to
you
governor
and
if
you
want
the
girl
i
not
so
set
on
having
her
back
home
again
but
what
i
might
be
open
to
an
arrangement
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
young
woman
she
a
fine
handsome
girl
as
a
daughter
she
not
worth
her
keep
and
so
i
tell
you
straight
all
i
ask
is
my
rights
as
a
father
and
you
the
last
man
alive
to
expect
me
to
let
her
go
for
nothing
for
i
can
see
you
one
of
the
straight
sort
governor
well
what
a
five
pound
note
to
you
and
what
eliza
to
me
he
returns
to
his
chair
and
sits
down
judicially
pickering
i
think
you
ought
to
know
doolittle
that
intentions
are
entirely
honorable
doolittle
course
they
are
governor
if
i
thought
they
was
i
ask
fifty
higgins
revolted
do
you
mean
to
say
you
callous
rascal
that
you
would
sell
your
daughter
for
pounds
doolittle
not
in
a
general
way
i
would
but
to
oblige
a
gentleman
like
you
i
do
a
good
deal
i
do
assure
you
pickering
have
you
no
morals
man
doolittle
unabashed
ca
afford
them
governor
neither
could
you
if
you
was
as
poor
as
me
not
that
i
mean
any
harm
you
know
but
if
liza
is
going
to
have
a
bit
out
of
this
why
not
me
too
higgins
troubled
i
do
know
what
to
do
pickering
there
can
be
no
question
that
as
a
matter
of
morals
it
a
positive
crime
to
give
this
chap
a
farthing
and
yet
i
feel
a
sort
of
rough
justice
in
his
claim
doolittle
that
it
governor
that
all
i
say
a
father
heart
as
it
were
pickering
well
i
know
the
feeling
but
really
it
seems
hardly
right
doolittle
do
say
that
governor
do
look
at
it
that
way
what
am
i
governors
both
i
ask
you
what
am
i
i
one
of
the
undeserving
poor
that
what
i
am
think
of
what
that
means
to
a
man
it
means
that
he
up
agen
middle
class
morality
all
the
time
if
anything
going
and
i
put
in
for
a
bit
of
it
it
always
the
same
story
you
undeserving
so
you
ca
have
it
but
my
needs
is
as
great
as
the
most
deserving
widow
that
ever
got
money
out
of
six
different
charities
in
one
week
for
the
death
of
the
same
husband
i
do
need
less
than
a
deserving
man
i
need
more
i
do
eat
less
hearty
than
him
and
i
drink
a
lot
more
i
want
a
bit
of
amusement
cause
i
a
thinking
man
i
want
cheerfulness
and
a
song
and
a
band
when
i
feel
low
well
they
charge
me
just
the
same
for
everything
as
they
charge
the
deserving
what
is
middle
class
morality
just
an
excuse
for
never
giving
me
anything
therefore
i
ask
you
as
two
gentlemen
not
to
play
that
game
on
me
i
playing
straight
with
you
i
ai
pretending
to
be
deserving
i
undeserving
and
i
mean
to
go
on
being
undeserving
i
like
it
and
that
the
truth
will
you
take
advantage
of
a
man
nature
to
do
him
out
of
the
price
of
his
own
daughter
what
he
brought
up
and
fed
and
clothed
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
until
she
growed
big
enough
to
be
interesting
to
you
two
gentlemen
is
five
pounds
unreasonable
i
put
it
to
you
and
i
leave
it
to
you
higgins
rising
and
going
over
to
pickering
pickering
if
we
were
to
take
this
man
in
hand
for
three
months
he
could
choose
between
a
seat
in
the
cabinet
and
a
popular
pulpit
in
wales
pickering
what
do
you
say
to
that
doolittle
doolittle
not
me

the
preachers
and
all
the
prime
ministers
for
i
a
thinking
man
and
game
for
politics
or
religion
or
social
reform
same
as
all
the
other
amusements
and
i
tell
you
it
a
dog
life
anyway
you
look
at
it
undeserving
poverty
is
my
line
taking
one
station
in
society
with
another
it
it
well
it
the
only
one
that
has
any
ginger
in
it
to
my
taste
higgins
i
suppose
we
must
give

a
fiver
pickering

bad
use
of
it
i
afraid
doolittle
not
me
governor
so

wo
do
you
be
afraid

be
a
penny
of
it
left
by
monday
i
have
to
go
to
work

as
if

had
it
it
wo
pauperize
me
you
bet
just
one
good
spree
for
myself
and
the
missus
giving
pleasure
to
ourselves
and
employment
to
others
and
satisfaction
to
you
to
think
it
not
been
throwed
away
you
could
spend
it
better
higgins
taking
out
his
pocket
book
and
coming
between
doolittle
and
the
piano
this
is
irresistible
let
give
him
ten
he
offers
two
notes
to
the
dustman
doolittle
no
governor
she
would
have
the
heart
to
spend
ten
and
perhaps
i
should
neither
ten
pounds
is
a
lot
of
money
it
makes
a
man
feel
prudent
like
and
then
goodbye
to
happiness
you
give
me
what
i
ask
you
governor

a
penny
more
and
not
a
penny
less

pretension
the
windows

too
handsome

of
useless
things

defied
fashion
in
her
youth
in
one
of
the
beautiful
rossettian
costumes
which
when
caricatured
by
people
who
did
not
understand

to
the
absurdities
of
popular
estheticism
in

in
the
corner

thoughtfully

phonetic
job
higgins

higgins
not
your
part
of
it

up
a
girl
higgins
does
that

that
some
girl
has
picked
you
up
higgins
not
at
all
i
do
mean
a
love
affair
higgins
what
a
pity
higgins
why
higgins
well
you
never
fall
in
love
with
anyone
under
when
will
you
discover
that
there
are
some
rather
young
women
about
higgins
oh
i
ca
be
bothered
with
young
women
my
idea
of
a
loveable
woman
is
something
as
like
you
as
possible
i
shall
never
get
into
the
way
of
seriously
liking
young
women
some
habits
lie
too
deep
to
be
changed
rising
abruptly
and
walking
about
jingling
his
money
and
his
keys
in
his
trouser
pockets
besides
they
all
idiots
higgins
do
you
know
what
you
would
do
if
you
really
loved
me
henry
higgins
oh
bother
what
marry
i
suppose
higgins
no
stop
fidgeting
and
take
your
hands
out
of
your
pockets
with
a
gesture
of
despair
he
obeys
and
sits
down
again
that
a
good
boy
now
tell
me
about
the
girl
higgins
she
coming
to
see
you
higgins
i
do
remember
asking
her
higgins
you
did
i
asked
her
if
you
known
her
you
would
have
asked
her
higgins
indeed
why
higgins
well
it
like
this
she
a
common
flower
girl
i
picked
her
off
the
kerbstone
higgins
and
invited
her
to
my
higgins
rising
and
coming
to
her
to
coax
her
oh
that
be
all
right
i
taught
her
to
speak
properly
and
she
has
strict
orders
as
to
her
behavior
she
to
keep
to
two
subjects
the
weather
and
everybody
health
fine
day
and
how
do
you
do
you
know
and
not
to
let
herself
go
on
things
in
general
that
will
be
safe
higgins
safe
to
talk
about
our
health
about
our
insides
perhaps
about
our
outsides
how
could
you
be
so
silly
henry
higgins
impatiently
well
she
must
talk
about
something
he
controls
himself
and
sits
down
again
oh
she
be
all
right
do
you
fuss
pickering
is
in
it
with
me
i
a
sort
of
bet
on
that
i
pass
her
off
as
a
duchess
in
six
months
i
started
on
her
some
months
ago
and
she
getting
on
like
a
house
on
fire
i
shall
win
my
bet
she
has
a
quick
ear
and
she
been
easier
to
teach
than
my
pupils
because
she
had
to
learn
a
complete
new
language
she
talks
english
almost
as
you
talk
french
higgins
that
satisfactory
at
all
events
higgins
well
it
is
and
it
is
higgins
what
does
that
mean
higgins
you
see
i
got
her
pronunciation
all
right
but
you
have
to
consider
not
only
how
a
girl
pronounces
but
what
she
pronounces
and
that
where
they
are
interrupted
by
the
announcing
guests
the
and
miss
eynsford
hill
she
withdraws
higgins
oh
lord
he
rises
snatches
his
hat
from
the
table
and
makes
for
the
door
but
before
he
reaches
it
his
mother
introduces
him
and
miss
eynsford
hill
are
the
mother
and
daughter
who
sheltered
from
the
rain
in
covent
garden
the
mother
is
well
bred
quiet
and
has
the
habitual
anxiety
of
straitened
means
the
daughter
has
acquired
a
gay
air
of
being
very
much
at
home
in
society
the
bravado
of
genteel
poverty
eynsford
hill
to
higgins
how
do
you
do
they
shake
hands
miss
eynsford
hill
how

elizabethan

a
little
bewildered

in

on
the
opposite

frozen
dessert
the

shakes
freddy

and
almost
slings

ottoman
with

to
the
other
side
of

about
until
eliza

the
royal
soirees
but
really
you
rather
trying
on
more
commonplace
occasions
higgins
am
i
very
sorry
beaming
suddenly
i
suppose
i
am
you
know
uproariously
ha
ha
miss
eynsford
hill
who
considers
higgins
quite
eligible
matrimonially
i
sympathize
i
have
any
small
talk
if
people
would
only
be
frank
and
say
what
they
really
think
higgins
relapsing
into
gloom
lord
forbid
eynsford
hill
taking
up
her
daughter
cue
but
why
higgins
what
they
think
they
ought
to
think
is
bad
enough
lord
knows
but
what
they
really
think
would
break
up
the
whole
show
do
you
suppose
it
would
be
really
agreeable
if
i
were
to
come
out
now
with
what
i
really
think
miss
eynsford
hill
gaily
is
it
so
very
cynical
higgins
cynical
who
the
dickens
said
it
was
cynical
i
mean
it
would
be
decent
eynsford
hill
seriously
oh
i
sure
you
do
mean
that
higgins
higgins
you
see
we
all
savages
more
or
less
we
supposed
to
be
civilized
and
cultured
to
know
all
about
poetry
and
philosophy
and
art
and
science
and
so
on
but
how
many
of
us
know
even
the
meanings
of
these
names
to
miss
hill
what
do
you
know
of
poetry
to
hill
what
do
you
know
of
science
indicating
freddy

or
science
or
anything
else
what

devil
do
you
imagine
i
know
of
philosophy
higgins
warningly
or
of
manners

miss
doolittle
she
withdraws

rising
hastily
and
running
to
higgins
here
she
is
mother
he
stands
on
tiptoe
and
makes
signs
over
his
mother
head
to
eliza
to
indicate
to
her
which
lady
is
her
hostess
eliza
who
is
exquisitely
dressed
produces
an
impression
of
such
remarkable
distinction
and
beauty
as
she
enters
that
they
all
rise
quite
flustered
guided
by
higgins
signals
she
comes
to
higgins
with
studied
grace
liza
speaking
with
pedantic
correctness
of
pronunciation
and
great
beauty
of
tone
how
do
you
do
higgins
she
gasps
slightly
in
making
sure
of
the
h
in
higgins
but
is
quite
successful

she
sits
down
on
the
ottoman
gracefully
in
the
place
just
left
vacant
by
higgins
eynsford
hill
introducing
my
daughter
clara
liza
how

you

clara
impulsively

she
sits
down
on
the
ottoman
beside
eliza
devouring
her
with
her
eyes
freddy
coming
to
their

the
pleasure

how

freddy
bows
and
sits
down
in
the
elizabethan
chair
infatuated
higgins
suddenly
by
george

back
to
me

stare
at
him
covent
garden
lamentably
what

the
edge
of
the
table
do

on

higgins
sulkily
sorry
he
goes
to
the
divan
stumbling
into
the
fender
and
over
the
on
his
way
extricating
himself
with
muttered
imprecations
and
finishing
his
disastrous
journey
by
throwing
himself
so
impatiently
on
the
divan
that
he
almost
breaks
it
higgins
looks
at
him
but
controls
herself
and
says
nothing
a
long
and
painful
pause
ensues
higgins
at
last
conversationally
will
it
rain
do
you
think
liza
the
shallow
depression
in
the
west
of
these
islands
is
likely
to
move
slowly
in
an
easterly
direction
there
are
no
indications
of
any
great
change
in
the
barometrical
situation
freddy
ha
ha
how
awfully
funny
liza
what
is
wrong
with
that
young
man
i
bet
i
got
it
right
freddy
killing
eynsford
hill
i
sure
i
hope
it
wo
turn
cold
there
so
much
influenza
about
it
runs
right
through
our
whole
family
regularly
every
spring
liza
darkly
my
aunt
died
of
influenza
so
they
said
eynsford
hill
clicks
her
tongue
sympathetically
liza
in
the
same
tragic
tone
but
it
my
belief
they
done
the
old
woman
in
higgins
puzzled
done
her
in
liza
lord
love
you
why
should
she
die
of
influenza
she
come
through
diphtheria
right
enough
the
year
before
i
saw
her
with
my
own
eyes
fairly
blue
with
it
she
was
they
all
thought
she
was
dead
but
my
father
he
kept
ladling
gin
down
her
throat
til
she
came
to
so
sudden
that
she
bit
the
bowl
off
the
spoon
eynsford
hill
startled
dear
me
liza
piling
up
the
indictment
what
call
would
a
woman
with
that
strength
in
her
have
to
die
of
influenza
what
become
of
her
new
straw
hat
that
should
have
come
to
me
somebody
pinched
it
and
what
i
say
is
them
as
pinched
it
done
her
in
eynsford
hill
what
does
doing
her
in
mean
higgins
hastily
oh
that
the
new
small
talk
to
do
a
person
in
means
to
kill
them
eynsford
hill
to
eliza
horrified
you
surely
do
believe
that
your
aunt
was
killed
liza
do
i
not
them
she
lived
with
would
have
killed
her
for
a
let
alone
a
hat
eynsford
hill
but
it
ca
have
been
right
for
your
father
to
pour
spirits
down
her
throat
like
that
it
might
have
killed
her
liza
not
her
gin
was
mother
milk
to
her
besides
he
poured
so
much
down
his
own
throat
that
he
knew
the
good
of
it
eynsford
hill
do
you
mean
that
he
drank
liza
drank
my
word
something
chronic
eynsford
hill
how
dreadful
for
you
liza
not
a
bit
it
never
did
him
no
harm
what
i
could
see
but
then
he
did
not
keep
it
up
regular
cheerfully
on
the
burst
as
you
might
say
from
time
to
time
and
always
more
agreeable
when
he
had
a
drop
in
when
he
was
out
of
work
my
mother
used
to
give
him
fourpence
and
tell
him
to
go
out
and
not
come
back
until
he
drunk
himself
cheerful
and
there
lots
of
women
has
to
make
their
husbands
drunk
to
make
them
fit
to
live
with
now
quite
at
her
ease
you
see
like
this
if
a
man
has
a
bit
of
a
conscience
it
always
takes
him
when
he
sober
and
then
it
makes
him
a
drop
of
booze
just
takes
that
off
and
makes
him
happy
to
freddy
who
is
in
convulsions
of
suppressed
laughter
here
what
are
you
sniggering
at
freddy
the
new
small
talk
you
do
it
so
awfully
well
liza
if
i
was
doing
it
proper
what
was
you
laughing
at
to
higgins
have
i
said
anything
i
ought
higgins
interposing
not
at
all
miss
doolittle
liza
well
that
a
mercy
anyhow
expansively
what
i
always
say
is
higgins
rising
and
looking
at
his
watch
ahem
liza
looking
round
at
him
taking
the
hint
and
rising
well
i
must
go
they
all
rise
freddy
goes
to
the
door
so
pleased
to
have
met
you
she
shakes
hands
with
higgins
higgins
liza
colonel
pickering
pickering
miss
doolittle
they
shake
hands
liza
nodding
to
the
others
all
freddy
opening
the
door
for
her
are
you
walking
across
the
park
miss
doolittle
if
so
liza
walk
not
bloody
likely
sensation
i
am
going
in
a
taxi
she
goes
out
pickering
gasps
and
sits
down
freddy
goes
out
on
the
balcony
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
eliza
eynsford
hill
suffering
from
shock
well
i
really
ca
get
used
to
the
new
ways
clara
throwing
herself
discontentedly
into
the
elizabethan
chair
oh
it
all
right
mamma
quite
right
people
will
think
we
never
go
anywhere
or
see
anybody
if
you
are
so
eynsford
hill
i
daresay
i
am
very
but
i
do
hope
you
wo
begin
using
that
expression
clara
i
have
got
accustomed
to
hear
you
talking
about
men
as
rotters
and
calling
everything
filthy
and
beastly
though
i
do
think
it
horrible
and
unladylike
but
this
last
is
really
too
much
do
you
think
so
colonel
pickering
pickering
do
ask
me
i
been
away
in
india
for
several
years
and
manners
have
changed
so
much
that
i
sometimes
do
know
whether
i
at
a
respectable
or
in
a
ship
forecastle
clara
it
all
a
matter
of
habit
there
no
right
or
wrong
in
it
nobody
means
anything
by
it
and
it
so
quaint
and
gives
such
a
smart
emphasis
to
things
that
are
not
in
themselves
very
witty
i
find
the
new
small
talk
delightful
and
quite
innocent
eynsford
hill
rising
well
after
that
i
think
it
time
for
us
to
go
pickering
and
higgins
rise
clara
rising
oh
yes
we
have
three
at
homes
to
go
to
still
higgins
colonel
pickering
professor
higgins
higgins
coming
grimly
at
her
from
the
divan
and
accompanying
her
to
the
door
be
sure
you
try
on
that
small
talk
at
the
three
do
be
nervous
about
it
pitch
it
in
strong
clara
all
smiles
i
will
such
nonsense
all
this
early
victorian
prudery
higgins
tempting
her
such
damned
nonsense
clara
such
bloody
nonsense
eynsford
hill
convulsively
clara
clara
ha
ha
she
goes
out
radiant
conscious
of
being
thoroughly
up
to
date
and
is
heard
descending
the
stairs
in
a
stream
of
silvery
laughter
freddy
to
the
heavens
at
large
well
i
ask
you
he
gives
it
up
and
comes
to
higgins
higgins
shaking
hands
would
you
like
to
meet
miss
doolittle
again
freddy
eagerly
yes
i
should
most
awfully
higgins
well
you
know
my
days
freddy
yes
thanks
awfully
he
goes
out
eynsford
hill
higgins
higgins
eynsford
hill
to
pickering
it
no
use
i
shall
never
be
able
to
bring
myself
to
use
that
word
pickering
do
it
not
compulsory
you
know
you
get
on
quite
well
without
it
eynsford
hill
only
clara
is
so
down
on
me
if
i
am
not
positively
reeking
with
the
latest
slang
pickering
they
shake
hands
eynsford
hill
to
higgins
you
must
mind
clara
pickering
catching
from
her
lowered
tone
that
this
is
not
meant
for
him
to
hear
discreetly
joins
higgins
at
the
window
we
so
poor
and
she
gets
so
few
parties
poor
child
she
does
quite
know
higgins
seeing
that
her
eyes
are
moist
takes
her
hand
sympathetically
and
goes
with
her
to
the
door
but
the
boy
is
nice
do
you
think
so
higgins
oh
quite
nice
i
shall
always
be
delighted
to
see
him
eynsford
hill
thank
you
dear
she
goes
out
higgins
eagerly
well
is
eliza
presentable
he
swoops
on
his
mother
and
drags
her
to
the
ottoman
where
she
sits
down
in
eliza
place
with
her
son
on
her
left
pickering
returns
to
his
chair
on
her
right
higgins
you
silly
boy
of
course
she
not
presentable
she
a
triumph
of
your
art
and
of
her
dressmaker
but
if
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
she
does
give
herself
away
in
every
sentence
she
utters
you
must
be
perfectly
cracked
about
her
pickering
but
do
you
think
something
might
be
done
i
mean
something
to
eliminate
the
sanguinary
element
from
her
conversation
higgins
not
as
long
as
she
is
in
henry
hands
higgins
aggrieved
do
you
mean
that
my
language
is
improper
higgins
no
dearest
it
would
be
quite
proper
say
on
a
canal
barge
but
it
would
not
be
proper
for
her
at
a
garden
party
higgins
deeply
injured
well
i
must
say
pickering
interrupting
him
come
higgins
you
must
learn
to
know
yourself
i
have
heard
such
language
as
yours
since
we
used
to
review
the
volunteers
in
hyde
park
twenty
years
ago
higgins
sulkily
oh
well
if
you
say
so
i
suppose
i
do
always
talk
like
a
bishop
higgins
quieting
henry
with
a
touch
colonel
pickering
will
you
tell
me
what
is
the
exact
state
of
things
in
wimpole
street
pickering
cheerfully
as
if
this
completely
changed
the
subject
well
i
have
come
to
live
there
with
henry
we
work
together
at
my
indian
dialects
and
we
think
it
more
convenient
higgins
quite
so
i
know
all
about
that
it
an
excellent
arrangement
but
where
does
this
girl
live
higgins
with
us
of
course
where
would
she
live
higgins
but
on
what
terms
is
she
a
servant
if
not
what
is
she
pickering
slowly
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
higgins
higgins
well
dash
me
if
i
do
i
had
to
work
at
the
girl
every
day
for
months
to
get
her
to
her
present
pitch
besides
she
useful
she
knows
where
my
things
are
and
remembers
my
appointments
and
so
forth
higgins
how
does
your
housekeeper
get
on
with
her
higgins
pearce
oh
she
jolly
glad
to
get
so
much
taken
off
her
hands
for
before
eliza
came
she
had
to
have
to
find
things
and
remind
me
of
my
appointments
but
she
got
some
silly
bee
in
her
bonnet
about
eliza
she
keeps
saying
you
do
think
sir
does
she
pick
pickering
yes
that
the
formula
you
do
think
sir
that
the
end
of
every
conversation
about
eliza
higgins
as
if
i
ever
stop
thinking
about
the
girl
and
her
confounded
vowels
and
consonants
i
worn
out
thinking
about
her
and
watching
her
lips
and
her
teeth
and
her
tongue
not
to
mention
her
soul
which
is
the
quaintest
of
the
lot
higgins
you
certainly
are
a
pretty
pair
of
babies
playing
with
your
live
doll
higgins
playing
the
hardest
job
i
ever
tackled
make
no
mistake
about
that
mother
but
you
have
no
idea
how
frightfully
interesting
it
is
to
take
a
human
being
and
change
her
into
a
quite
different
human
being
by
creating
a
new
speech
for
her
it
filling
up
the
deepest
gulf
that
separates
class
from
class
and
soul
from
soul
pickering
drawing
his
chair
closer
to
higgins
and
bending
over
to
her
eagerly
yes
it
enormously
interesting
i
assure
you
higgins
we
take
eliza
very
seriously
every
week
every
day
almost
there
is
some
new
change
closer
again
we
keep
records
of
every
stage
dozens
of
gramophone
disks
and
photographs
higgins
assailing
her
at
the
other
ear
yes
by
george
it
the
most
absorbing
experiment
i
ever
tackled
she
regularly
fills
our
lives
up
does
she
pick
pickering
we
always
talking
eliza
higgins
teaching
eliza
pickering
dressing
eliza
higgins
what
higgins
inventing
new
elizas
higgins
and
pickering
speaking
together
higgins
you
know
she
has
the
most
extraordinary
quickness
of
ear
pickering
i
assure
you
my
dear
higgins
that
girl
higgins
just
like
a
parrot
i
tried
her
with
every
pickering
is
a
genius
she
can
play
the
piano
quite
beautifully
higgins
possible
sort
of
sound
that
a
human
being
can
make
pickering
we
have
taken
her
to
classical
concerts
and
to
music
higgins
continental
dialects
african
dialects
hottentot
pickering
halls
and
it
all
the
same
to
her
she
plays
everything
higgins
clicks
things
it
took
me
years
to
get
hold
of
and
pickering
she
hears
right
off
when
she
comes
home
whether
higgins
she
picks
them
up
like
a
shot
right
away
as
if
she
had
pickering
beethoven
and
brahms
or
lehar
and
lionel
morickton
higgins
been
at
it
all
her
life
pickering
though
six
months
ago
she
never
as
much
as
touched
a
piano
higgins
putting
her
fingers
in
her
ears
as
they
are
by
this
time
shouting
one
another
down
with
an
intolerable
noise
sh
sh
sh
sh
they
stop
pickering
i
beg
your
pardon
he
draws
his
chair
back
apologetically
higgins
sorry
when
pickering
starts
shouting
nobody
can
get
a
word
in
edgeways
higgins
be
quiet
henry
colonel
pickering
do
you
realize
that
when
eliza
walked
into
wimpole
street
something
walked
in
with
her
pickering
her
father
did
but
henry
soon
got
rid
of
him
higgins
it
would
have
been
more
to
the
point
if
her
mother
had
but
as
her
mother
did
something
else
did
pickering
but
what
higgins
unconsciously
dating
herself
by
the
word
a
problem
pickering
oh
i
see
the
problem
of
how
to
pass
her
off
as
a
lady
higgins
i
solve
that
problem
i
half
solved
it
already
higgins
no
you
two
infinitely
stupid
male
creatures
the
problem
of
what
is
to
be
done
with
her
afterwards
higgins
i
do
see
anything
in
that
she
can
go
her
own
way
with
all
the
advantages
i
have
given
her
higgins
the
advantages
of
that
poor
woman
who
was
here
just
now
the
manners
and
habits
that
disqualify
a
fine
lady
from
earning
her
own
living
without
giving
her
a
fine
lady
income
is
that
what
you
mean
pickering
indulgently
being
rather
bored
oh
that
will
be
all
right
higgins
he
rises
to
go
higgins
rising
also
we
find
her
some
light
employment
pickering
she
happy
enough
do
you
worry
about
her
he
shakes
hands
as
if
he
were
consoling
a
frightened
child
and
makes
for
the
door
higgins
anyhow
there
no
good
bothering
now
the
thing
done
mother
he
kisses
her
and
follows
pickering
pickering
turning
for
a
final
consolation
there
are
plenty
of
openings
we
do
what
right
higgins
to
pickering
as
they
go
out
together
let
take
her
to
the
shakespear
exhibition
at
earls
court
pickering
yes
let
her
remarks
will
be
delicious
higgins
she
mimic
all
the
people
for
us
when
we
get
home
pickering
ripping
both
are
heard
laughing
as
they
go
downstairs
higgins
rises
with
an
impatient
bounce
and
returns
to
her
work
at
the
she
sweeps
a
litter
of
disarranged
papers
out
of
her
way
snatches
a
sheet
of
paper
from
her
stationery
case
and
tries
resolutely
to
write
at
the
third
line
she
gives
it
up
flings
down
her
pen
grips
the
table
angrily
and
exclaims
oh
men
men
men
act
iv
the
wimpole
street
laboratory
midnight
nobody
in
the
room
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
strikes
twelve
the
fire
is
not
alight
it
is
a
summer
night
presently
higgins
and
pickering
are
heard
on
the
stairs
higgins
calling
down
to
pickering
i
say
pick

higgins
lord
no
eliza
opens
the
door
and
is
seen
on
the
lighted
landing
in
opera
cloak
brilliant
evening
dress
and
diamonds
with
fan
flowers
and
all
accessories
she
comes
to
the
hearth
and
switches
on
the
electric
lights
there
she
is
tired
her
pallor
contrasts
strongly
with
her
dark
eyes
and
hair
and
her
expression
is
almost
tragic
she
takes
off
her
cloak
puts
her
fan
and
flowers
on
the
piano
and
sits
down
on
the
bench
brooding
and
silent
higgins
in
evening
dress
with
overcoat
and
hat
comes
in
carrying
a
smoking
jacket
which
he
has
picked
up
downstairs
he
takes
off
the
hat
and
overcoat
throws
them
carelessly
on
the
newspaper
stand
disposes
of
his
coat
in
the
same
way
puts
on
the
smoking
jacket
and
throws
himself
wearily
into
the
at
the
hearth
pickering
similarly
attired
comes
in
he
also
takes
off
his
hat
and
overcoat
and
is
about
to
throw
them
on
higgins
when
he
hesitates
pickering
i
say
pearce
will
row
if
we
leave
these
things
lying
about
in
the
higgins
oh
chuck
them
over
the
bannisters
into
the
hall
she
find
them
there
in
the
morning
and
put
them
away
all
right
she
think
we
were
drunk
pickering
we
are
slightly

there
any
letters
higgins
i
did
look
pickering
takes
the
overcoats
and
hats
and
goes
down
stairs
higgins
begins
half
singing
half
yawning
an
air
from
la
fanciulla
del
golden
west
suddenly
he
stops
and
exclaims
i
wonder
where
the
devil
my
slippers
are
eliza
looks
at
him
darkly
then
leaves
the
room
higgins
yawns
again
and
resumes
his
song
pickering
returns
with
the
contents
of
the
in
his
hand
pickering
only
circulars
and
this
coroneted
for
you
he
throws
the
circulars
into
the
fender
and
posts
himself
on
the
hearthrug
with
his
back
to
the
grate
higgins
glancing
at
the
he
throws
the
letter
after
the
circulars
eliza
returns
with
a
pair
of
large
slippers
she
places
them
on
the
carpet
before
higgins
and
sits
as
before
without
a
word
higgins
yawning
again
oh
lord
what
an
evening
what
a
crew
what
a
silly
tomfoollery
he
raises
his
shoe
to
unlace
it
and
catches
sight
of
the
slippers
he
stops
unlacing
and
looks
at
them
as
if
they
had
appeared
there
of
their
own
accord
oh
they
there
are
they
pickering
stretching
himself
well
i
feel
a
bit
tired
it
been
a
long
day
the
garden
party
a
dinner
party
and
the
opera
rather
too
much
of
a
good
thing
but
you
won
your
bet
higgins
eliza
did
the
trick
and
something
to
spare
eh
higgins
fervently
thank
god
it
over
eliza
flinches
violently
but
they
take
no
notice
of
her
and
she
recovers
herself
and
sits
stonily
as
before
pickering
were
you
nervous
at
the
garden
party
i
was
eliza
seem
a
bit
nervous
higgins
oh
she
was
nervous
i
knew
she
be
all
right
no
the
strain
of
putting
the
job
through
all
these
months
that
has
told
on
me
it
was
interesting
enough
at
first
while
we
were
at
the
phonetics
but
after
that
i
got
deadly
sick
of
it
if
i
had
backed
myself
to
do
it
i
should
have
chucked
the
whole
thing
up
two
months
ago
it
was
a
silly
notion
the
whole
thing
has
been
a
bore
pickering
oh
come
the
garden
party
was
frightfully
exciting
my
heart
began
beating
like
anything
higgins
yes
for
the
first
three
minutes
but
when
i
saw
we
were
going
to
win
hands
down
i
felt
like
a
bear
in
a
cage
hanging
about
doing
nothing
the
dinner
was
worse
sitting
gorging
there
for
over
an
hour
with
nobody
but
a
damned
fool
of
a
fashionable
woman
to
talk
to
i
tell
you
pickering
never
again
for
me
no
more
artificial
duchesses
the
whole
thing
has
been
simple
purgatory
pickering
you
never
been
broken
in
properly
to
the
social
routine
strolling
over
to
the
piano
i
rather
enjoy
dipping
into
it
occasionally
myself
it
makes
me
feel
young
again
anyhow
it
was
a
great
success
an
immense
success
i
was
quite
frightened
once
or
twice
because
eliza
was
doing
it
so
well
you
see
lots
of
the
real
people
ca
do
it
at
all
they
such
fools
that
they
think
style
comes
by
nature
to
people
in
their
position
and
so
they
never
learn
always
something
professional
about
doing
a
thing
superlatively
well
higgins
yes
that
what
drives
me
mad
the
silly
people
do
know
their
own
silly
business
rising
however
it
over
and
done
with
and
now
i
can
go
to
bed
at
last
without
dreading
tomorrow
eliza
beauty
becomes
murderous
pickering
i
think
i
shall
turn
in
too
still
it
been
a
great
occasion
a
triumph
for
you
he
goes
higgins
following
him
over
his
shoulder
at
the
door
put
out
the
lights
eliza
and
tell
pearce
not
to
make
coffee
for
me
in
the
morning
i
take
tea
he
goes
out
eliza
tries
to
control
herself
and
feel
indifferent
as
she
rises
and
walks
across
to
the
hearth
to
switch
off
the
lights
by
the
time
she
gets
there
she
is
on
the
point
of
screaming
she
sits
down
in
chair
and
holds
on
hard
to
the
arms
finally
she
gives
way
and
flings
herself
furiously
on
the
floor
raging
higgins
in
despairing
wrath
outside
what
the
devil
have
i
done
with
my
slippers
he
appears
at
the
door
liza
snatching
up
the
slippers
and
hurling
them
at
him
one
after
the
other
with
all
her
force
there
are
your
slippers
and
there
take
your
slippers
and
may
you
never
have
a
day
luck
with
them
higgins
astounded
what
on
earth
he
comes
to
her
what
the
matter
get
up
he
pulls
her
up
anything
wrong
liza
breathless
nothing
wrong
with
you
i
won
your
bet
for
you
have
i
that
enough
for
you
do
matter
i
suppose
higgins
you
won
my
bet
you
presumptuous
insect
won
it
what
did
you
throw
those
slippers
at
me
for
liza
because
i
wanted
to
smash
your
face
i
like
to
kill
you
you
selfish
brute
why
did
you
leave
me
where
you
picked
me
out
of
in
the
gutter
you
thank
god
it
all
over
and
that
now
you
can
throw
me
back
again
there
do
you
she
crisps
her
fingers
frantically
higgins
looking
at
her
in
cool
wonder
the
creature
is
nervous
after
all
liza
gives
a
suffocated
scream
of
fury
and
instinctively
darts
her
nails
at
his
face
higgins
catching
her
wrists
ah
would
you
claws
in
you
cat
how
dare
you
show
your
temper
to
me
sit
down
and
be
quiet
he
throws
her
roughly
into
the
liza
crushed
by
superior
strength
and
weight
what
to
become
of
me
what
to
become
of
me
higgins
how
the
devil
do
i
know
what
to
become
of
you
what
does
it
matter
what
becomes
of
you
liza
you
do
care
i
know
you
do
care
you
would
care
if
i
was
dead
i
nothing
to
you
not
so
much
as
them
slippers
higgins
thundering
those
slippers
liza
with
bitter
submission
those
slippers
i
did
think
it
made
any
difference
now
a
pause
eliza
hopeless
and
crushed
higgins
a
little
uneasy
higgins
in
his
loftiest
manner
why
have
you
begun
going
on
like
this
may
i
ask
whether
you
complain
of
your
treatment
here
liza
no
higgins
has
anybody
behaved
badly
to
you
colonel
pickering
pearce
any
of
the
servants
liza
no
higgins
i
presume
you
do
pretend
that
i
have
treated
you
badly
liza
no
higgins
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
he
moderates
his
tone
perhaps
tired
after
the
strain
of
the
day
will
you
have
a
glass
of
champagne
he
moves
towards
the
door
liza
no
recollecting
her
manners
thank
you
higgins
again
this
has
been
coming
on
you
for
some
days
i
suppose
it
was
natural
for
you
to
be
anxious
about
the
garden
party
but
that
all
over
now
he
pats
her
kindly
on
the
shoulder
she
writhes
there
nothing
more
to
worry
about
liza
no
nothing
more
for
you
to
worry
about
she
suddenly
rises
and
gets
away
from
him
by
going
to
the
piano
bench
where
she
sits
and
hides
her
face
oh
god
i
wish
i
was
dead
higgins
staring
after
her
in
sincere
surprise
why
in
heaven
name
why
reasonably
going
to
her
listen
to
me
eliza
all
this
irritation
is
purely
subjective
liza
i
do
understand
i
too
ignorant
higgins
it
only
imagination
low
spirits
and
nothing
else
hurting
you
nothing
wrong
you
go
to
bed
like
a
good
girl
and
sleep
it
off
have
a
little
cry
and
say
your
prayers
that
will
make
you
comfortable
liza
i
heard
your
prayers
thank
god
it
all
over
higgins
impatiently
well
do
you
thank
god
it
all
over
now
you
are
free
and
can
do
what
you
like
liza
pulling
herself
together
in
desperation
what
am
i
fit
for
what
have
you
left
me
fit
for
where
am
i
to
go
what
am
i
to
do
what
to
become
of
me
higgins
enlightened
but
not
at
all
impressed
oh
that
worrying
you
is
it
he
thrusts
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
walks
about
in
his
usual
manner
rattling
the
contents
of
his
pockets
as
if
condescending
to
a
trivial
subject
out
of
pure
kindness
i
bother
about
it
if
i
were
you
i
should
imagine
you
wo
have
much
difficulty
in
settling
yourself
somewhere
or
other
though
i
quite
realized
that
you
were
going
away
she
looks
quickly
at
him
he
does
not
look
at
her
but
examines
the
dessert
stand
on
the
piano
and
decides
that
he
will
eat
an
apple
you
might
marry
you
know
he
bites
a
large
piece
out
of
the
apple
and
munches
it
noisily
you
see
eliza
all
men
are
not
confirmed
old
bachelors
like
me
and
the
colonel
most
men
are
the
marrying
sort
poor
devils
and
you
not
it
quite
a
pleasure
to
look
at
you
sometimes
not
now
of
course
because
you
crying
and
looking
as
ugly
as
the
very
devil
but
when
you
all
right
and
quite
yourself
you
what
i
should
call
attractive
that
is
to
the
people
in
the
marrying
line
you
understand
you
go
to
bed
and
have
a
good
nice
rest
and
then
get
up
and
look
at
yourself
in
the
glass
and
you
wo
feel
so
cheap
eliza
again
looks
at
him
speechless
and
does
not
stir
the
look
is
quite
lost
on
him
he
eats
his
apple
with
a
dreamy
expression
of
happiness
as
it
is
quite
a
good
one
higgins
a
genial
afterthought
occurring
to
him
i
daresay
my
mother
could
find
some
chap
or
other
who
would
do
very
well
liza
we
were
above
that
at
the
corner
of
tottenham
court
road
higgins
waking
up
what
do
you
mean
liza
i
sold
flowers
i
did
sell
myself
now
you
made
a
lady
of
me
i
not
fit
to
sell
anything
else
i
wish
you
left
me
where
you
found
me
higgins
slinging
the
core
of
the
apple
decisively
into
the
grate
tosh
eliza
do
you
insult
human
relations
by
dragging
all
this
cant
about
buying
and
selling
into
it
you
need
marry
the
fellow
if
you
do
like
him
liza
what
else
am
i
to
do
higgins

of
things

old
idea
of
a
shop

you
up
in
one

lots
of
money
chuckling

have
to
pay
for
all
those
togs
you
have
been
wearing
today
and
that
with
the
hire
of
the
jewellery
will
make
a
big
hole
in
two
hundred
pounds
why
six
months
ago
you
would
have
thought
it
the
millennium
to
have
a
flower
shop
of
your
own
come

all
right
i
must
clear
off
to

forget
what
it
was
liza
your
slippers
higgins
oh
yes
of
course
you
shied
them
at
me
he
picks
them
up
and
is
going
out
when
she
rises
and
speaks
to
him
liza
before
you

higgins
dropping
the
slippers
in
his
surprise
at
her
calling
him
sir
eh
liza
do
my
clothes
belong
to
me
or
to
colonel
pickering
higgins
coming
back
into
the
room
as
if
her
question
were
the
very
climax
of
unreason
what
the
devil
use
would
they
be
to
pickering
liza
he
might
want
them
for
the
next
girl
you
pick
up
to
experiment
on
higgins
shocked
and
hurt
is
that
the
way
you
feel
towards
us
liza
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
more
about
that
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
anything
belongs
to
me
my
own
clothes
were
burnt
higgins
but
what
does
it
matter
why
need
you
start
bothering
about
that
in
the
middle
of
the
night
liza
i
want
to
know
what
i
may
take
away
with
me
i
do
want
to
be
accused
of
stealing
higgins
now
deeply
wounded
stealing
you
should
have
said
that
eliza
that
shows
a
want
of
feeling
liza
i
sorry
i
only
a
common
ignorant
girl
and
in
my
station
i
have
to
be
careful

any
feelings
between
the
like
of
you
and
the
like
of
me

tell
me
what

higgins
very
sulky
you
may
take
the
whole
damned
houseful
if
you
like
except
the
jewels
they
hired
will
that
satisfy
you
he
turns
on
his
heel
and
is
about
to
go
in
extreme
dudgeon
liza
drinking
in
his
emotion
like
nectar
and
nagging
him
to
provoke
a
further
supply
stop
please
she
takes
off
her
jewels
will
you
take
these
to
your
room
and
keep
them
safe
i
do
want
to
run
the
risk
of
their
being
missing
higgins
furious
hand
them
over
she
puts
them
into
his
hands
if
these
belonged
to
me
instead
of
to
the
jeweler
i
ram
them
down
your
ungrateful
throat
he
perfunctorily
thrusts
them
into
his
pockets
unconsciously
decorating
himself
with
the
protruding
ends
of
the
chains
liza
taking
a
ring
off
this
ring
is
the
jeweler
it
the
one
you
bought
me
in
brighton
i
do
want
it
now
higgins
dashes
the
ring
violently
into
the
fireplace
and
turns
on
her
so
threateningly
that
she
crouches
over
the
piano
with
her
hands
over
her
face
and
exclaims
do
you
hit
me
higgins
hit
you
you
infamous
creature
how
dare
you
accuse
me
of
such
a
thing
it
is
you
who
have
hit
me
you
have
wounded
me
to
the
heart
liza
thrilling
with
hidden
joy
i
glad
i
got
a
little
of
my
own
back
anyhow
higgins
with
dignity
in
his
finest
professional
style
you
have
caused
me
to
lose
my
temper
a
thing
that
has
hardly
ever
happened
to
me
before
i
prefer
to
say
nothing
more
tonight
i
am
going
to

a
note
for
pearce

formally
damn
pearce
and

and
damn
my
own
folly
in
having
lavished
my
knowledge
and
the
treasure
of
my
regard
and
intimacy
on
a
heartless
guttersnipe
he
goes
out
with
impressive
decorum
and
spoils
it
by
slamming
the
door
savagely
eliza
smiles
for
the
first
time
expresses
her
feelings
by
a
wild
pantomime
in
which
an
imitation
of
higgins
exit
is
confused
with
her
own
triumph
and
finally
goes
down
on
her
knees
on
the
hearthrug
to
look
for
the
ring
act
v
higgins
she
is
at
her
as
before

i
thought
i
better
tell
you
higgins
if
you
had
told
me
that
henry
was

would
have
been
more
surprising

police
i
suppose
he
lost
something
the
yes

you
to
go

remember
making
some
silly
joke
of
the
kind
doolittle
ah
you
may
well
call
it
a
silly
joke
it
put
the
lid
on
me
right
enough
just
give
him
the
chance
he
wanted
to
show
that
americans
is
not
like
us
that
they
recognize
and
respect
merit
in
every
class
of
life
however
humble
them
words
is
in
his
blooming
will
in
which
henry
higgins
thanks
to
your
silly
joking
he
leaves
me
a
share
in
his
cheese
trust
worth
three
thousand
a
year
on
condition
that

reform
world
league
as
often
as
they
ask
me
up
to
six
times
a
year
higgins
the
devil
he
does
whew
brightening
suddenly
what
a
lark
pickering
a
safe
thing
for
you
doolittle
they
wo
ask
you
twice
doolittle
it
ai
the
lecturing
i
mind
i
lecture
them
blue
in
the
face
i
will
and
not
turn
a
hair
it
making
a
gentleman
of
me
that
i
object
to
who
asked
him
to
make
a
gentleman
of
me
i
was
happy
i
was
free
i
touched
pretty
nigh
everybody
for
money
when
i
wanted
it
same
as
i
touched
you
henry
higgins
now
i
am
worrited
tied
neck
and
heels
and
everybody
touches
me
for
money
it
a
fine
thing
for
you
says
my
solicitor
is
it
says
i
you
mean
it
a
good
thing
for
you
i
says
when
i
was
a
poor
man
and
had
a
solicitor
once
when
they
found
a
pram
in
the
dust
cart
he
got
me
off
and
got
shut
of
me
and
got
me
shut
of
him
as
quick
as
he
could
same
with
the
doctors
used
to
shove
me
out
of
the
hospital
before
i
could
hardly
stand
on
my
legs
and
nothing
to
pay
now
they
finds
out
that
i
not
a
healthy
man
and
live
unless
they
looks
after
me
twice
a
day
in
the
house
i
not
let
do
a
hand
turn
for
myself
somebody
else
must
do
it
and
touch
me
for
it
a
year
ago
i
had
a
relative
in
the
world
except
two
or
three
that
would
speak
to
me
now
i
fifty
and
not
a
decent
wages
among
the
lot
of
them
i
have
to
live
for
others
and
not
for
myself
that
middle
class
morality
you
talk
of
losing
eliza
you
be
anxious
i
bet
she
on
my
doorstep
by
this
she
that
could
support
herself
easy
by
selling
flowers
if
i
was
respectable
and
the
next
one
to
touch
me
will
be
you
henry
higgins
i
have
to
learn
to
speak
middle
class
language
from
you
instead
of
speaking
proper
english
that
where
you
come
in
and
i
daresay
that
what
you
done
it
for
higgins
but
my
dear
doolittle
you
need
not
suffer
all
this
if
you
are
really
in
earnest
nobody
can
force
you
to
accept
this
bequest
you
can
repudiate
it
is
that
so
colonel
pickering
pickering
i
believe
so
doolittle
softening
his
manner
in
deference
to
her
sex
that
the
tragedy
of
it
it
easy
to
say
chuck
it
but
i
have
the
nerve
which
one
of
us
has
we
all
intimidated
intimidated
that
what
we
are
what
is
there
for
me
if
i
chuck
it
but
the
workhouse
in
my
old
age
i
have
to
dye
my
hair
already
to
keep
my
job
as
a
dustman
if
i
was
one
of
the
deserving
poor
and
had
put
by
a
bit
i
could
chuck
it
but
then
why
should
i
acause
the
deserving
poor
might
as
well
be
millionaires
for
all
the
happiness
they
ever
has
they
do
know
what
happiness
is
but
i
as
one
of
the
undeserving
poor
have
nothing
between
me
and
the
pauper
uniform
but
this
here
blasted
three
thousand
a
year
that
shoves
me
into
the
middle
class
excuse
the
expression
you
use
it
yourself
if
you
had
my
provocation
they
got
you
every
way
you
turn
it
a
choice
between
the
skilly
of
the
workhouse
and
the
char
bydis
of
the
middle
class
and
i
have
the
nerve
for
the
workhouse
intimidated
that
what
i
am
broke
bought
up
happier
men
than
me
will
call
for
my
dust
and
touch
me
for
their
tip
and
i
look
on
helpless
and
envy
them
and
that
what
your
son
has
brought
me
to
he
is
overcome
by
emotion
higgins
well
i
very
glad
you
not
going
to
do
anything
foolish
doolittle
for
this
solves
the
problem
of
eliza
future
you
can
provide
for
her
now
doolittle
with
melancholy
resignation
yes
i
expected
to
provide
for
everyone
now
out
of
three
thousand
a
year
higgins
jumping
up
nonsense
he
ca
provide
for
her
he
provide
for
her
she
does
belong
to
him
i
paid
him
five
pounds
for
her
doolittle
either
you
an
honest
man
or
a
rogue
doolittle
tolerantly
a
little
of
both
henry
like
the
rest
of
us
a
little
of
both
higgins
well
you
took
that
money
for
the
girl
and
you
have
no
right
to
take
her
as
well
higgins
henry
do
be
absurd
if
you
really
want
to
know
where
eliza
is
she
is
upstairs
higgins
amazed
upstairs
then
i
shall
jolly
soon
fetch
her
downstairs
he
makes
resolutely
for
the
door
higgins
rising
and
following
him
be
quiet
henry
sit
down
higgins
i
higgins
sit
down
dear
and
listen
to
me
higgins
oh
very
well
very
well
very
well
he
throws
himself
ungraciously
on
the
ottoman
with
his
face
towards
the
windows
but
i
think
you
might
have
told
me
this
half
an
hour
ago
higgins
eliza
came
to
me
this
morning
she
passed
the
night
partly
walking
about
in
a
rage
partly
trying
to
throw
herself
into
the
river
and
being
afraid
to
and
partly
in
the
carlton
hotel
she
told
me
of
the
brutal
way
you
two
treated
her
higgins
bounding
up
again
what
pickering
rising
also
my
dear
higgins
she
been
telling
you
stories
we
did
treat
her
brutally
we
hardly
said
a
word
to
her
and
we
parted
on
particularly
good
terms
turning
on
higgins
higgins
did
you
bully
her
after
i
went
to
bed
higgins
just
the
other
way
about
she
threw
my
slippers
in
my
face
she
behaved
in
the
most
outrageous
way
i
never
gave
her
the
slightest
provocation
the
slippers
came
bang
into
my
face
the
moment
i
entered
the
room
before
i
had
uttered
a
word
and
used
perfectly
awful
language
pickering
astonished
but
why
what
did
we
do
to
her
higgins
i
think
i
know
pretty
well
what
you
did
the
girl
is
naturally
rather
affectionate
i
think
is
she
doolittle
doolittle
very
takes
after
me
higgins
just
so
she
had
become
attached
to
you
both
she
worked
very
hard
for
you
henry
i
do
think
you
quite
realize
what
anything
in
the
nature
of
brain
work
means
to
a
girl
like
that
well
it
seems
that
when
the
great
day
of
trial
came
and
she
did
this
wonderful
thing
for
you
without
making
a
single
mistake
you
two
sat
there
and
never
said
a
word
to
her
but
talked
together
of
how
glad
you
were
that
it
was
all
over
and
how
you
had
been
bored
with
the
whole
thing
and
then
you
were
surprised
because
she
threw
your
slippers
at
you
should
have
thrown
the
at
you
higgins
we
said
nothing
except
that
we
were
tired
and
wanted
to
go
to
bed
did
we
pick
pickering
shrugging
his
shoulders
that
was
all
higgins
ironically
quite
sure
pickering
absolutely
really
that
was
all
higgins
you
did
thank
her
or
pet
her
or
admire
her
or
tell
her
how
splendid
she
been
higgins
impatiently
but
she
knew
all
about
that
we
did
make
speeches
to
her
if
that
what
you
mean
pickering
conscience
stricken
perhaps
we
were
a
little
inconsiderate
is
she
very
angry
higgins
returning
to
her
place
at
the
well
afraid
she
wo
go
back
to
wimpole
street
especially
now
that
doolittle
is
able
to
keep
up
the
position
you
have
thrust
on
her
but
she
says
she
is
quite
willing
to
meet
you
on
friendly
terms
and
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
higgins
furious
is
she
by
george
ho
higgins
if
you
promise
to
behave
yourself
henry
i
ask
her
to
come
down
if
not
go
home
for
you
have
taken
up
quite
enough
of
my
time
higgins
oh
all
right
very
well
pick
you
behave
yourself
let
us
put
on
our
best
sunday
manners
for
this
creature
that
we
picked
out
of
the
mud
he
flings
himself
sulkily
into
the
elizabethan
chair
doolittle
remonstrating
now
now
henry
higgins
have
some
consideration
for
my
feelings
as
a
middle
class
man
higgins
remember
your
promise
henry
she
presses
the
on
the
doolittle
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
step
out
on
the
balcony
for
a
moment
i
do
want
eliza
to
have
the
shock
of
your
news
until
she
has
made
it
up
with
these
two
gentlemen
would
you
mind
doolittle
as
you
wish
lady
anything
to
help
henry
to
keep
her
off
my
hands
he
disappears
through
the
window
the
answers
the
bell
pickering
sits
down
in
place
higgins
ask
miss
doolittle
to
come
down
please
the
yes
mam
she
goes
out
higgins
now
henry
be
good
higgins
i
am
behaving
myself
perfectly
pickering
he
is
doing
his
best
higgins
a
pause
higgins
throws
back
his
head
stretches
out
his
legs
and
begins
to
whistle
higgins
henry
dearest
you
do
look
at
all
nice
in
that
attitude
higgins
pulling
himself
together
i
was
not
trying
to
look
nice
mother
higgins
it
does
matter
dear
i
only
wanted
to
make
you
speak
higgins
why
higgins
because
you
ca
speak
and
whistle
at
the
same
time
higgins
groans
another
very
trying
pause
higgins
springing
up
out
of
patience
where
the
devil
is
that
girl
are
we
to
wait
here
all
day
eliza
enters
sunny
and
giving
a
staggeringly
convincing
exhibition
of
ease
of
manner
she
carries
a
little
and
is
very
much
at
home
pickering
is
too
much
taken
aback
to
rise
liza
how
do
you
do
professor
higgins
are
you
quite
well
higgins
choking
am
i
he
can
say
no
more
liza
but
of
course
you
are
you
are
never
ill
so
glad
to
see
you
again
colonel
pickering
he
rises
hastily
and
they
shake
hands
quite
chilly
this
morning
is
it
she
sits
down
on
his
left
he
sits
beside
her
higgins
do
you
dare
try
this
game
on
me
i
taught
it
to
you
and
it
does
take
me
in
get
up
and
come
home
and
do
be
a
fool
eliza
takes
a
piece
of
needlework
from
her
basket
and
begins
to
stitch
at
it
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
this
outburst
higgins
very
nicely
put
indeed
henry
no
woman
could
resist
such
an
invitation
higgins
you
let
her
alone
mother
let
her
speak
for
herself
you
will
jolly
soon
see
whether
she
has
an
idea
that
i
have
put
into
her
head
or
a
word
that
i
have
put
into
her
mouth
i
tell
you
i
have
created
this
thing
out
of
the
squashed
cabbage
leaves
of
covent
garden
and
now
she
pretends
to
play
the
fine
lady
with
me
higgins
placidly
yes
dear
but
you
sit
down
wo
you
higgins
sits
down
again
savagely
liza
to
pickering
taking
no
apparent
notice
of
higgins
and
working
away
deftly
will
you
drop
me
altogether
now
that
the
experiment
is
over
colonel
pickering
pickering
oh
do
you
must
think
of
it
as
an
experiment
it
shocks
me
somehow
liza
oh
i
only
a
squashed
cabbage
leaf
pickering
impulsively
no
liza
continuing
quietly
but
i
owe
so
much
to
you
that
i
should
be
very
unhappy
if
you
forgot
me
pickering
it
very
kind
of
you
to
say
so
miss
doolittle
liza
it
not
because
you
paid
for
my
dresses
i
know
you
are
generous
to
everybody
with
money
but
it
was
from
you
that
i
learnt
really
nice
manners
and
that
is
what
makes
one
a
lady
is
it
you
see
it
was
so
very
difficult
for
me
with
the
example
of
professor
higgins
always
before
me
i
was
brought
up
to
be
just
like
him
unable
to
control
myself
and
using
bad
language
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
i
should
never
have
known
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
did
behave
like
that
if
you
had
been
there
higgins
well
pickering
oh
that
only
his
way
you
know
he
does
mean
it
liza
oh
i
did
mean
it
either
when
i
was
a
flower
girl
it
was
only
my
way
but
you
see
i
did
it
and
that
what
makes
the
difference
after
all
pickering
no
doubt
still
he
taught
you
to
speak
and
i
could
have
done
that
you
know
liza
trivially
of
course
that
is
his
profession
higgins
damnation
liza
continuing
it
was
just
like
learning
to
dance
in
the
fashionable
way
there
was
nothing
more
than
that
in
it
but
do
you
know
what
began
my
real
education
pickering
what
liza
stopping
her
work
for
a
moment
your
calling
me
miss
doolittle
that
day
when
i
first
came
to
wimpole
street
that
was
the
beginning
of
for
me
she
resumes
her
stitching
and
there
were
a
hundred
little
things
you
never
noticed
because
they
came
naturally
to
you
things
about
standing
up
and
taking
off
your
hat
and
opening
doors
pickering
oh
that
was
nothing
liza
yes
things
that
showed
you
thought
and
felt
about
me
as
if
i
were
something
better
than
a
scullerymaid
though
of
course
i
know
you
would
have
been
just
the
same
to
a
if
she
had
been
let
in
the
you
never
took
off
your
boots
in
the
dining
room
when
i
was
there
pickering
you
must
mind
that
higgins
takes
off
his
boots
all
over
the
place
liza
i
know
i
am
not
blaming
him
it
is
his
way
is
it
but
it
made
such
a
difference
to
me
that
you
did
do
it
you
see
really
and
truly
apart
from
the
things
anyone
can
pick
up
the
dressing
and
the
proper
way
of
speaking
and
so
on
the
difference
between
a
lady
and
a
flower
girl
is
not
how
she
behaves
but
how
she
treated
i
shall
always
be
a
flower
girl
to
professor
higgins
because
he
always
treats
me
as
a
flower
girl
and
always
will
but
i
know
i
can
be
a
lady
to
you
because
you
always
treat
me
as
a
lady
and
always
will
higgins
please
do
grind
your
teeth
henry

is

of

old

forgets
its

weeks
without
me
at
her
elbow
doolittle
appears
at
the
centre
window
with
a
look
of
dignified
reproach
at
higgins
he
comes
slowly
and
silently
to
his
daughter
who

now
poor

ill
feeling
i
be
back
in
a
moment
she
goes
out

sitting
down
beside

i
feel
uncommon
nervous
about
the
ceremony
colonel
i
wish
you
come
and
see
me
through
it
pickering
but
you
been
through
it
before
man
you
were
married
to
eliza
mother
doolittle
who
told
you
that
colonel
pickering
well
nobody
told
me
but
i
concluded
naturally
doolittle
no
that
ai
the
natural
way
colonel
it
only
the
middle
class
way
my
way
was
always
the
undeserving
way
but
do
say
nothing
to
eliza
she
do
know
i
always
had
a
delicacy
about
telling
her
pickering
quite
right
we
leave
it
so
if
you
do
mind
doolittle
and
you
come
to
the
church
colonel
and
put
me
through
straight
pickering
with
pleasure
as
far
as
a
bachelor
can
higgins
may
i
come
doolittle
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
miss
your
wedding
doolittle
i
should
indeed
be
honored
by
your
condescension
and
my
poor
old
woman
would
take
it
as
a
tremenjous
compliment
she
been
very
low
thinking
of
the
happy
days
that
are
no
more
higgins
rising
i
order
the
carriage
and
get
ready
the
men
rise
except
higgins
i
sha
be
more
than
fifteen
minutes
as
she
goes
to
the
door
eliza
comes
in
hatted
and
buttoning
her
gloves
going
to
the
church
to
see
your
father
married
eliza
you
had
better
come
in
the
brougham
with
me
colonel
pickering
can
go
on
with
the
bridegroom
higgins
goes
out
eliza
comes
to
the
middle
of
the
room
between
the
centre
window
and
the
ottoman
pickering
joins
her
doolittle
bridegroom
what
a
word
it
makes
a
man
realize
his
position
somehow
he
takes
up
his
hat
and
goes
towards
the
door
pickering
before
i
go
eliza
do
forgive
him
and
come
back
to
us
liza
i
do
think
papa
would
allow
me
would
you
dad
doolittle
sad
but
magnanimous
they
played
you
off
very
cunning
eliza
them
two
sportsmen
if
it
had
been
only
one
of
them
you
could
have
nailed
him
but
you
see
there
was
two
and
one
of
them
chaperoned
the
other
as
you
might
say
to
pickering
it
was
artful
of
you
colonel
but
i
bear
no
malice
i
should
have
done
the
same
myself
i
been
the
victim
of
one
woman
after
another
all
my
life
and
i
grudge
you
two
getting
the
better
of
eliza
i
sha
interfere
time
for
us
to
go
colonel
so
long
henry
see
you
in
george
eliza
he
goes
out
pickering
coaxing
do
stay
with
us
eliza
he
follows
doolittle
eliza
goes
out
on
the
balcony
to
avoid
being
alone
with
higgins
he
rises
and
joins
her
there
she
immediately
comes
back
into
the
room
and
makes
for
the
door
but
he
goes
along
the
balcony
quickly
and
gets
his
back
to
the
door
before
she
reaches
it
higgins
well
eliza
you
had
a
bit
of
your
own
back
as
you
call
it
have
you
had
enough
and
are
you
going
to
be
reasonable
or
do
you
want
any
more
liza
you
want
me
back
only
to
pick
up
your
slippers
and
put
up
with
your
tempers
and
fetch
and
carry
for
you
higgins
i
have
said
i
wanted
you
back
at
all
liza
oh
indeed
then
what
are
we
talking
about
higgins
about
you
not
about
me
if
you
come
back
i
shall
treat
you
just
as
i
have
always
treated
you
i
ca
change
my
nature
and
i
do
intend
to
change
my
manners
my
manners
are
exactly
the
same
as
colonel
pickering
liza
that
not
true
he
treats
a
flower
girl
as
if
she
was
a
duchess
higgins
and
i
treat
a
duchess
as
if
she
was
a
flower
girl
liza
i
see
she
turns
away
composedly
and
sits
on
the
ottoman
facing
the
window
the
same
to
everybody
higgins
just
so
liza
like
father
higgins
grinning
a
little
taken
down
without
accepting
the
comparison
at
all
points
eliza
it
quite
true
that
your
father
is
not
a
snob
and
that
he
will
be
quite
at
home
in
any
station
of
life
to
which
his
eccentric
destiny
may
call
him
seriously
the
great
secret
eliza
is
not
having
bad
manners
or
good
manners
or
any
other
particular
sort
of
manners
but
having
the
same
manner
for
all
human
souls
in
short
behaving
as
if
you
were
in
heaven
where
there
are
no
carriages
and
one
soul
is
as
good
as
another
liza
amen
you
are
a
born
preacher
higgins
irritated
the
question
is
not
whether
i
treat
you
rudely
but
whether
you
ever
heard
me
treat
anyone
else
better
liza
with
sudden
sincerity
i
do
care
how
you
treat
me
i
mind
your
swearing
at
me
i
do
mind
a
black
eye
i
had
one
before
this
but
standing
up
and
facing
him
i
wo
be
passed
over
higgins
then
get
out
of
my
way
for

for
you

about
me
as

a
motor
bus

you
try
to
get
round
me

have
to
do
without
me
higgins
arrogant
i
can
do
without
anybody

spark
of
divine
fire

sudden
humility
i
shall
miss

down
near
her
on
the
ottoman
i
have
learnt
something
from
your
idiotic
notions

and
gratefully

i
have
grown
accustomed
to
your
voice
and
appearance
i
like
them

your
gramophone
and
in
your
book
of
photographs
when

turn
the
machine
on
it
got
no
feelings

feelings
and
you
can
take
away
the
voice
and
the
face
they
are
not
you
liza
oh
you
are
a
devil
you
can
twist
the
heart
in
a
girl
as
easy
as
some
could
twist
her
arms
to
hurt
her
pearce
warned
me
time
and
again
she
has
wanted
to
leave
you
and
you
always
got
round
her
at
the
last
minute

bit
for
her
and
you
do
care
a
bit
for
me
higgins
i
care
for

a
part
of
it
that

built
into
my
house

i
am
expressing
my
righteous
contempt
for
commercialism
i
do
and
wo
trade
in
affection

because
you
could
buy
a
claim
on
me
by
fetching
my
slippers
and
finding
my
spectacles
you
were
a
fool
i
think
a
woman
fetching
a
man
slippers
is
a
disgusting
sight
did
i
ever
fetch
your
slippers
i
think
a
good
deal
more
of
you
for
throwing
them
in
my
face
no
use
slaving
for
me
and
then
saying
you
want
to
be
cared
for
who
cares
for
a
slave
if
you
come
back
come
back
for
the
sake
of
good
fellowship
for
you
get
nothing
else
you
had
a
thousand
times
as
much
out
of
me
as
i
have
out
of
you
and
if
you
dare
to
set
up
your
little
dog
tricks
of
fetching
and
carrying
slippers

my
creation
of
a
duchess
eliza
i
slam

liza
what

higgins
heartily
why

trouble
it
would
make

higgins
would
the
world
ever
have
been
made
if
its
maker
had
been
afraid
of
making
trouble
making
life
means
making
trouble
only
one
way
of
escaping
trouble
and
that
killing

if
you
asked
me
and

what
he
is
liza
losing
her
temper
and
rising
i
talk
as
i
like
you
not
my
teacher
now
higgins
reflectively
i
do
suppose
pickering
would
though
he
as
confirmed
an
old
bachelor
as
i
am
liza
that
not
what
i
want
and
do
you
think
it
i
always
had
chaps
enough
wanting

that
way
freddy
hill
writes
to
me
twice
and
three
times
a
day
sheets
and
sheets
higgins
disagreeably
surprised
damn
his
impudence
he
recoils
and
finds
himself
sitting
on
his
heels
liza
he
has
a
right
to
if
he
likes
poor
lad
and
he
does
love
me
higgins
getting
off
the
ottoman
you
have
no
right
to
encourage
him
liza
every
girl
has
a
right
to
be
loved
higgins
what
by
fools
like
that
liza
freddy
not
a
fool
and
if
he
weak
and
poor
and
wants

be
he
make
me
happier

my
betters
that
bully
me
and
do
want
me
higgins
can
he
make
anything
of
you
that
the
point
liza
perhaps
i
could
make
something
of
him
but
i
never
thought
of
us
making
anything
of
one
another
and
you
never
think
of
anything
else
i
only
want
to
be
natural
higgins
in
short
you
want
me
to
be
as
infatuated
about
you
as
freddy
is
that
it
liza
no
i
do
that
not
the
sort
of
feeling
i
want
from

and
do
you
be
too
sure
of
yourself
or
of
me
i
could
have
been
a
bad
girl
if
i
liked
i
seen
more
of
some
things
than
you
for
all
your
learning
girls
like
me
can
drag
gentlemen
down
to
make
love
to
them
easy
enough
and
they
wish
each
other
dead
the
next
minute
higgins
of
course
they
do
then
what
in
thunder

we
quarrelling
about
liza
much
troubled
i
want
a
little
kindness
i
know
i
a
common
ignorant
girl
and
you
a
gentleman
but
i
not
dirt
under
your
feet
what
i
done
correcting
herself
what
i
did
was
not
for
the
dresses
and
the
taxis
i
did
it
because
we
were
pleasant
together
and
i
come
came
to
care
for
you
not
to
want
you
to
make
love
to
me
and
not
forgetting
the
difference
between
us
but
more
friendly
like
higgins
well
of
course
that
just
how
i
feel
and
how
pickering
feels
eliza

proper
answer
to
give
me
she
sinks
on
the
chair
at
the
in
tears
higgins
it
all
you
get
until
you
stop
being
a
common
idiot
if
you
going
to
be
a
lady
you
have
to
give
up
feeling
neglected
if
the
men
you
know
do
spend
half
their
time
snivelling
over
you
and
the
other
half
giving
you
black
eyes
if
you
ca
stand
the
coldness
of
my
sort
of
life
and
the
strain
of
it
go
back
to
the
gutter
work
til
you
are
more
a
brute
than
a
human
being
and
then
cuddle
and
squabble
and
drink
til
you
fall
asleep
oh
it
a
fine
life
the
life
of
the
gutter
it
real
it
warm
it
violent
you
can
feel
it
through
the
thickest
skin
you
can
taste
it
and
smell
it
without
any
training
or
any
work
not
like

you

well
be

and
a
thick
pair
of
lips
to
kiss

a
thick
pair
of

or
somebody
who

on
freddy
liza
you
think
i
like
you
to
say
that
but
i
have
forgot
what

higgins
independence
that
middle

in
a
fury

some
day
he
lets

stamping
with
rage
at
having
forgotten
himself
and
recoils
so
hastily
that
he
stumbles
back
into
his
seat
on
the
ottoman
aha
now
i
know
how
to
deal
with
you
what
a
fool
i
was
not
to
think
of
it
before
you
ca
take
away
the
knowledge
you
gave
me
you
said
i
had
a
finer
ear
than
you
and
i
can
be
civil

which
is
more
than
you
can
aha
that
done

now
i
do
care
that
snapping
her
fingers
for
your
bullying
and
your
big

advertize

in
the
papers
that
your

only
a
flower
girl
that
you
taught
and
that
teach
anybody
to
be
a
duchess
just
the
same
in
six
months
for
a
thousand
guineas
oh
when
i
think
of
myself
crawling
under
your
feet
and
being
trampled
on
and
called
names
when
all
the
time
i
had
only
to
lift
up
my
finger
to
be
as
good
as
you
i
could
just
kick
myself
higgins
wondering
at
her
you
damned
impudent
slut
you
but
better
than
snivelling
better
than
fetching
slippers
and
finding
spectacles
is
it
rising
by
george
eliza
i
said
i
make
a
woman
of
you
and
i
have
i
like
you
like
this
liza

higgins
of
course
i
do
you
little
fool
five
minutes
ago
you
were
like
a
millstone
round
my
neck
now
you
a
tower
of
strength
a
consort
battleship
you
and
i
and
pickering
will
be
three
old
bachelors
together
instead
of
only
two
men
and
a
silly
girl
higgins
returns
dressed
for
the
wedding
eliza
instantly
becomes
cool
and
elegant
higgins
the
carriage
is
waiting
eliza
are
you
ready
liza
quite
is
the
professor
coming
higgins
certainly
not
he
ca
behave
himself
in
church
he
makes
remarks
out
loud
all
the
time
on
the
clergyman
pronunciation
liza
then
i
shall
not
see
you
again
professor
good
bye
she
goes
to
the
door
higgins
coming
to
higgins
dear
higgins
mother
he
is
about
to
kiss
her
when
he
recollects
something
oh
by
the
way
eliza
order
a
ham
and
a
stilton
cheese
will
you
and
buy
me
a
pair
of
reindeer
gloves
number
eights
and
a
tie
to
match
that
new
suit
of
mine
at
eale
binman
you
can
choose
the
color
his
cheerful
careless
vigorous
voice
shows
that
he
is
incorrigible
liza
disdainfully
buy
them
yourself
she
sweeps
out
higgins
i
afraid
you
spoiled
that
girl
henry
but
never
mind
dear
i
buy
you
the
tie
and
gloves
higgins
sunnily
oh
do
bother
she
buy
em
all
right
enough
they
kiss
higgins
runs
out
higgins
left
alone
rattles
his
cash
in
his
pocket
chuckles
and
disports
himself
in
a
highly
manner
the
rest
of
the
story
need
not
be
shown
in
action
and
indeed
would
hardly
need
telling
if
our
imaginations
were
not
so
enfeebled
by
their
lazy
dependence
on
the
and
of
the
ragshop
in
which
romance
keeps
its
stock
of
happy
endings
to
misfit
all
stories
now
the
history
of
eliza
doolittle
though
called
a
romance
because
of
the
transfiguration
it
records
seems
exceedingly
improbable
is
common
enough
such
transfigurations
have
been
achieved
by
hundreds
of
resolutely
ambitious
young
women
since
nell
gwynne
set
them
the
example
by
playing
queens
and
fascinating
kings
in
the
theatre
in
which
she
began
by
selling
oranges
nevertheless
people
in
all
directions
have
assumed
for
no
other
reason
than
that
she
became
the
heroine
of
a
romance
that
she
must
have
married
the
hero
of
it
this
is
unbearable
not
only
because
her
little
drama
if
acted
on
such
a
thoughtless
assumption
must
be
spoiled
but
because
the
true
sequel
is
patent
to
anyone
with
a
sense
of
human
nature
in
general
and
of
feminine
instinct
in
particular
eliza
in
telling
higgins
she
would
not
marry
him
if
he
asked
her
was
not
coquetting
she
was
announcing
a
decision
when
a
bachelor
interests
and
dominates
and
teaches
and
becomes
important
to
a
spinster
as
higgins
with
eliza
she
always
if
she
has
character
enough
to
be
capable
of
it
considers
very
seriously
indeed
whether
she
will
play
for
becoming
that
bachelor
wife
especially
if
he
is
so
little
interested
in
marriage
that
a
determined
and
devoted
woman
might
capture
him
if
she
set
herself
resolutely
to
do
it
her
decision
will
depend
a
good
deal
on
whether
she
is
really
free
to
choose
and
that
again
will
depend
on
her
age
and
income
if
she
is
at
the
end
of
her
youth
and
has
no
security
for
her
livelihood
she
will
marry
him
because
she
must
marry
anybody
who
will
provide
for
her
but
at
age
a
girl
does
not
feel
that
pressure
she
feels
free
to
pick
and
choose
she
is
therefore
guided
by
her
instinct
in
the
matter
eliza
instinct
tells
her
not
to
marry
higgins
it
does
not
tell
her
to
give
him
up
it
is
not
in
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
his
remaining
one
of
the
strongest
personal
interests
in
her
life
it
would
be
very
sorely
strained
if
there
was
another
woman
likely
to
supplant
her
with
him
but
as
she
feels
sure
of
him
on
that
last
point
she
has
no
doubt
at
all
as
to
her
course
and
would
not
have
any
even
if
the
difference
of
twenty
years
in
age
which
seems
so
great
to
youth
did
not
exist
between
them
as
our
own
instincts
are
not
appealed
to
by
her
conclusion
let
us
see
whether
we
can
not
discover
some
reason
in
it
when
higgins
excused
his
indifference
to
young
women
on
the
ground
that
they
had
an
irresistible
rival
in
his
mother
he
gave
the
clue
to
his
inveterate
the
case
is
uncommon
only
to
the
extent
that
remarkable
mothers
are
uncommon
if
an
imaginative
boy
has
a
sufficiently
rich
mother
who
has
intelligence
personal
grace
dignity
of
character
without
harshness
and
a
cultivated
sense
of
the
best
art
of
her
time
to
enable
her
to
make
her
house
beautiful
she
sets
a
standard
for
him
against
which
very
few
women
can
struggle
besides
effecting
for
him
a
disengagement
of
his
affections
his
sense
of
beauty
and
his
idealism
from
his
specifically
sexual
impulses
this
makes
him
a
standing
puzzle
to
the
huge
number
of
uncultivated
people
who
have
been
brought
up
in
tasteless
homes
by
commonplace
or
disagreeable
parents
and
to
whom
consequently
literature
painting
sculpture
music
and
affectionate
personal
relations
come
as
modes
of
sex
if
they
come
at
all
the
word
passion
means
nothing
else
to
them
and
that
higgins
could
have
a
passion
for
phonetics
and
idealize
his
mother
instead
of
eliza
would
seem
to
them
absurd
and
unnatural
nevertheless
when
we
look
round
and
see
that
hardly
anyone
is
too
ugly
or
disagreeable
to
find
a
wife
or
a
husband
if
he
or
she
wants
one
whilst
many
old
maids
and
bachelors
are
above
the
average
in
quality
and
culture
we
can
not
help
suspecting
that
the
disentanglement
of
sex
from
the
associations
with
which
it
is
so
commonly
confused
a
disentanglement
which
persons
of
genius
achieve
by
sheer
intellectual
analysis
is
sometimes
produced
or
aided
by
parental
fascination
now
though
eliza
was
incapable
of
thus
explaining
to
herself
formidable
powers
of
resistance
to
the
charm
that
prostrated
freddy
at
the
first
glance
she
was
instinctively
aware
that
she
could
never
obtain
a
complete
grip
of
him
or
come
between
him
and
his
mother
the
first
necessity
of
the
married
woman
to
put
it
shortly
she
knew
that
for
some
mysterious
reason
he
had
not
the
makings
of
a
married
man
in
him
according
to
her
conception
of
a
husband
as
one
to
whom
she
would
be
his
nearest
and
fondest
and
warmest
interest
even
had
there
been
no
she
would
still
have
refused
to
accept
an
interest
in
herself
that
was
secondary
to
philosophic
interests
had
higgins
died
there
would
still
have
been
milton
and
the
universal
alphabet
landor
remark
that
to
those
who
have
the
greatest
power
of
loving
love
is
a
secondary
affair
would
not
have
recommended
landor
to
eliza
put
that
along
with
her
resentment
of
higgins
domineering
superiority
and
her
mistrust
of
his
coaxing
cleverness
in
getting
round
her
and
evading
her
wrath
when
he
had
gone
too
far
with
his
impetuous
bullying
and
you
will
see
that
eliza
instinct
had
good
grounds
for
warning
her
not
to
marry
her
pygmalion
and
now
whom
did
eliza
marry
for
if
higgins
was
a
predestinate
old
bachelor
she
was
most
certainly
not
a
predestinate
old
maid
well
that
can
be
told
very
shortly
to
those
who
have
not
guessed
it
from
the
indications
she
has
herself
given
them
almost
immediately
after
eliza
is
stung
into
proclaiming
her
considered
determination
not
to
marry
higgins
she
mentions
the
fact
that
young
frederick
eynsford
hill
is
pouring
out
his
love
for
her
daily
through
the
post
now
freddy
is
young
practically
twenty
years
younger
than
higgins
he
is
a
gentleman
or
as
eliza
would
qualify
him
a
toff
and
speaks
like
one
he
is
nicely
dressed
is
treated
by
the
colonel
as
an
equal
loves
her
unaffectedly
and
is
not
her
master
nor
ever
likely
to
dominate
her
in
spite
of
his
advantage
of
social
standing
eliza
has
no
use
for
the
foolish
romantic
tradition
that
all
women
love
to
be
mastered
if
not
actually
bullied
and
beaten
when
you
go
to
women
says
nietzsche
take
your
whip
with
you
sensible
despots
have
never
confined
that
precaution
to
women
they
have
taken
their
whips
with
them
when
they
have
dealt
with
men
and
been
slavishly
idealized
by
the
men
over
whom
they
have
flourished
the
whip
much
more
than
by
women
no
doubt
there
are
slavish
women
as
well
as
slavish
men
and
women
like
men
admire
those
that
are
stronger
than
themselves
but
to
admire
a
strong
person
and
to
live
under
that
strong
thumb
are
two
different
things
the
weak
may
not
be
admired
and
but
they
are
by
no
means
disliked
or
shunned
and
they
never
seem
to
have
the
least
difficulty
in
marrying
people
who
are
too
good
for
them
they
may
fail
in
emergencies
but
life
is
not
one
long
emergency
it
is
mostly
a
string
of
situations
for
which
no
exceptional
strength
is
needed
and
with
which
even
rather
weak
people
can
cope
if
they
have
a
stronger
partner
to
help
them
out
accordingly
it
is
a
truth
everywhere
in
evidence
that
strong
people
masculine
or
feminine
not
only
do
not
marry
stronger
people
but
do
not
show
any
preference
for
them
in
selecting
their
friends
when
a
lion
meets
another
with
a
louder
roar
the
first
lion
thinks
the
last
a
bore
the
man
or
woman
who
feels
strong
enough
for
two
seeks
for
every
other
quality
in
a
partner
than
strength
the
converse
is
also
true
weak
people
want
to
marry
strong
people
who
do
not
frighten
them
too
much
and
this
often
leads
them
to
make
the
mistake
we
describe
metaphorically
as
biting
off
more
than
they
can
chew
they
want
too
much
for
too
little
and
when
the
bargain
is
unreasonable
beyond
all
bearing
the
union
becomes
impossible
it
ends
in
the
weaker
party
being
either
discarded
or
borne
as
a
cross
which
is
worse
people
who
are
not
only
weak
but
silly
or
obtuse
as
well
are
often
in
these
difficulties
this
being
the
state
of
human
affairs
what
is
eliza
fairly
sure
to
do
when
she
is
placed
between
freddy
and
higgins
will
she
look
forward
to
a
lifetime
of
fetching
higgins
slippers
or
to
a
lifetime
of
freddy
fetching
hers
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
answer
unless
freddy
is
biologically
repulsive
to
her
and
higgins
biologically
attractive
to
a
degree
that
overwhelms
all
her
other
instincts
she
will
if
she
marries
either
of
them
marry
freddy
and
that
is
just
what
eliza
did
complications
ensued
but
they
were
economic
not
romantic
freddy
had
no
money
and
no
occupation
his
mother
jointure
a
last
relic
of
the
opulence
of
largelady
park
had
enabled
her
to
struggle
along
in
earlscourt
with
an
air
of
gentility
but
not
to
procure
any
serious
secondary
education
for
her
children
much
less
give
the
boy
a
profession
a
clerkship
at
thirty
shillings
a
week
was
beneath
dignity
and
extremely
distasteful
to
him
besides
his
prospects
consisted
of
a
hope
that
if
he
kept
up
appearances
somebody
would
do
something
for
him
the
something
appeared
vaguely
to
his
imagination
as
a
private
secretaryship
or
a
sinecure
of
some
sort
to
his
mother
it
perhaps
appeared
as
a
marriage
to
some
lady
of
means
who
could
not
resist
her
boy
niceness
fancy
her
feelings
when
he
married
a
flower
girl
who
had
become
declassee
under
extraordinary
circumstances
which
were
now
notorious
it
is
true
that
eliza
situation
did
not
seem
wholly
ineligible
her
father
though
formerly
a
dustman
and
now
fantastically
disclassed
had
become
extremely
popular
in
the
smartest
society
by
a
social
talent
which
triumphed
over
every
prejudice
and
every
disadvantage
rejected
by
the
middle
class
which
he
loathed
he
had
shot
up
at
once
into
the
highest
circles
by
his
wit
his
dustmanship
which
he
carried
like
a
banner
and
his
nietzschean
transcendence
of
good
and
evil
at
intimate
ducal
dinners
he
sat
on
the
right
hand
of
the
duchess
and
in
country
houses
he
smoked
in
the
pantry
and
was
made
much
of
by
the
butler
when
he
was
not
feeding
in
the
and
being
consulted
by
cabinet
ministers
but
he
found
it
almost
as
hard
to
do
all
this
on
four
thousand
a
year
as
eynsford
hill
to
live
in
earlscourt
on
an
income
so
pitiably
smaller
that
i
have
not
the
heart
to
disclose
its
exact
figure
he
absolutely
refused
to
add
the
last
straw
to
his
burden
by
contributing
to
eliza
support
thus
freddy
and
eliza
now
and
eynsford
hill
would
have
spent
a
penniless
honeymoon
but
for
a
wedding
present
of
pounds
from
the
colonel
to
eliza
it
lasted
a
long
time
because
freddy
did
not
know
how
to
spend
money
never
having
had
any
to
spend
and
eliza
socially
trained
by
a
pair
of
old
bachelors
wore
her
clothes
as
long
as
they
held
together
and
looked
pretty
without
the
least
regard
to
their
being
many
months
out
of
fashion
still
pounds
will
not
last
two
young
people
for
ever
and
they
both
knew
and
eliza
felt
as
well
that
they
must
shift
for
themselves
in
the
end
she
could
quarter
herself
on
wimpole
street
because
it
had
come
to
be
her
home
but
she
was
quite
aware
that
she
ought
not
to
quarter
freddy
there
and
that
it
would
not
be
good
for
his
character
if
she
did
not
that
the
wimpole
street
bachelors
objected
when
she
consulted
them
higgins
declined
to
be
bothered
about
her
housing
problem
when
that
solution
was
so
simple
eliza
desire
to
have
freddy
in
the
house
with
her
seemed
of
no
more
importance
than
if
she
had
wanted
an
extra
piece
of
bedroom
furniture
pleas
as
to
freddy
character
and
the
moral
obligation
on
him
to
earn
his
own
living
were
lost
on
higgins
he
denied
that
freddy
had
any
character
and
declared
that
if
he
tried
to
do
any
useful
work
some
competent
person
would
have
the
trouble
of
undoing
it
a
procedure
involving
a
net
loss
to
the
community
and
great
unhappiness
to
freddy
himself
who
was
obviously
intended
by
nature
for
such
light
work
as
amusing
eliza
which
higgins
declared
was
a
much
more
useful
and
honorable
occupation
than
working
in
the
city
when
eliza
referred
again
to
her
project
of
teaching
phonetics
higgins
abated
not
a
jot
of
his
violent
opposition
to
it
he
said
she
was
not
within
ten
years
of
being
qualified
to
meddle
with
his
pet
subject
and
as
it
was
evident
that
the
colonel
agreed
with
him
she
felt
she
could
not
go
against
them
in
this
grave
matter
and
that
she
had
no
right
without
higgins
consent
to
exploit
the
knowledge
he
had
given
her
for
his
knowledge
seemed
to
her
as
much
his
private
property
as
his
watch
eliza
was
no
communist
besides
she
was
superstitiously
devoted
to
them
both
more
entirely
and
frankly
after
her
marriage
than
before
it
it
was
the
colonel
who
finally
solved
the
problem
which
had
cost
him
much
perplexed
cogitation
he
one
day
asked
eliza
rather
shyly
whether
she
had
quite
given
up
her
notion
of
keeping
a
flower
shop
she
replied
that
she
had
thought
of
it
but
had
put
it
out
of
her
head
because
the
colonel
had
said
that
day
at
higgins
that
it
would
never
do
the
colonel
confessed
that
when
he
said
that
he
had
not
quite
recovered
from
the
dazzling
impression
of
the
day
before
they
broke
the
matter
to
higgins
that
evening
the
sole
comment
vouchsafed
by
him
very
nearly
led
to
a
serious
quarrel
with
eliza
it
was
to
the
effect
that
she
would
have
in
freddy
an
ideal
errand
boy
freddy
himself
was
next
sounded
on
the
subject
he
said
he
had
been
thinking
of
a
shop
himself
though
it
had
presented
itself
to
his
pennilessness
as
a
small
place
in
which
eliza
should
sell
tobacco
at
one
counter
whilst
he
sold
newspapers
at
the
opposite
one
but
he
agreed
that
it
would
be
extraordinarily
jolly
to
go
early
every
morning
with
eliza
to
covent
garden
and
buy
flowers
on
the
scene
of
their
first
meeting
a
sentiment
which
earned
him
many
kisses
from
his
wife
he
added
that
he
had
always
been
afraid
to
propose
anything
of
the
sort
because
clara
would
make
an
awful
row
about
a
step
that
must
damage
her
matrimonial
chances
and
his
mother
could
not
be
expected
to
like
it
after
clinging
for
so
many
years
to
that
step
of
the
social
ladder
on
which
retail
trade
is
impossible
this
difficulty
was
removed
by
an
event
highly
unexpected
by
mother
clara
in
the
course
of
her
incursions
into
those
artistic
circles
which
were
the
highest
within
her
reach
discovered
that
her
conversational
qualifications
were
expected
to
include
a
grounding
in
the
novels
of
wells
she
borrowed
them
in
various
directions
so
energetically
that
she
swallowed
them
all
within
two
months
the
result
was
a
conversion
of
a
kind
quite
common
today
a
modern
acts
of
the
apostles
would
fill
fifty
whole
bibles
if
anyone
were
capable
of
writing
it
poor
clara
who
appeared
to
higgins
and
his
mother
as
a
disagreeable
and
ridiculous
person
and
to
her
own
mother
as
in
some
inexplicable
way
a
social
failure
had
never
seen
herself
in
either
light
for
though
to
some
extent
ridiculed
and
mimicked
in
west
kensington
like
everybody
else
there
she
was
accepted
as
a
rational
and
normal
or
shall
we
say
inevitable
sort
of
human
being
at
worst
they
called
her
the
pusher
but
to
them
no
more
than
to
herself
had
it
ever
occurred
that
she
was
pushing
the
air
and
pushing
it
in
a
wrong
direction
still
she
was
not
happy
she
was
growing
desperate
her
one
asset
the
fact
that
her
mother
was
what
the
epsom
greengrocer
called
a
carriage
lady
had
no
exchange
value
apparently
it
had
prevented
her
from
getting
educated
because
the
only
education
she
could
have
afforded
was
education
with
the
earlscourt
green
grocer
daughter
it
had
led
her
to
seek
the
society
of
her
mother
class
and
that
class
simply
would
not
have
her
because
she
was
much
poorer
than
the
greengrocer
and
far
from
being
able
to
afford
a
maid
could
not
afford
even
a
housemaid
and
had
to
scrape
along
at
home
with
an
illiberally
treated
general
servant
under
such
circumstances
nothing
could
give
her
an
air
of
being
a
genuine
product
of
largelady
park
and
yet
its
tradition
made
her
regard
a
marriage
with
anyone
within
her
reach
as
an
unbearable
humiliation
commercial
people
and
professional
people
in
a
small
way
were
odious
to
her
she
ran
after
painters
and
novelists
but
she
did
not
charm
them
and
her
bold
attempts
to
pick
up
and
practise
artistic
and
literary
talk
irritated
them
she
was
in
short
an
utter
failure
an
ignorant
incompetent
pretentious
unwelcome
penniless
useless
little
snob
and
though
she
did
not
admit
these
disqualifications
for
nobody
ever
faces
unpleasant
truths
of
this
kind
until
the
possibility
of
a
way
out
dawns
on
them
she
felt
their
effects
too
keenly
to
be
satisfied
with
her
position
clara
had
a
startling
eyeopener
when
on
being
suddenly
wakened
to
enthusiasm
by
a
girl
of
her
own
age
who
dazzled
her
and
produced
in
her
a
gushing
desire
to
take
her
for
a
model
and
gain
her
friendship
she
discovered
that
this
exquisite
apparition
had
graduated
from
the
gutter
in
a
few
months
time
it
shook
her
so
violently
that
when
wells
lifted
her
on
the
point
of
his
puissant
pen
and
placed
her
at
the
angle
of
view
from
which
the
life
she
was
leading
and
the
society
to
which
she
clung
appeared
in
its
true
relation
to
real
human
needs
and
worthy
social
structure
he
effected
a
conversion
and
a
conviction
of
sin
comparable
to
the
most
sensational
feats
of
general
booth
or
gypsy
smith
clara
snobbery
went
bang
life
suddenly
began
to
move
with
her
without
knowing
how
or
why
she
began
to
make
friends
and
enemies
some
of
the
acquaintances
to
whom
she
had
been
a
tedious
or
indifferent
or
ridiculous
affliction
dropped
her
others
became
cordial
to
her
amazement
she
found
that
some
quite
nice
people
were
saturated
with
wells
and
that
this
accessibility
to
ideas
was
the
secret
of
their
niceness
people
she
had
thought
deeply
religious
and
had
tried
to
conciliate
on
that
tack
with
disastrous
results
suddenly
took
an
interest
in
her
and
revealed
a
hostility
to
conventional
religion
which
she
had
never
conceived
possible
except
among
the
most
desperate
characters
they
made
her
read
galsworthy
and
galsworthy
exposed
the
vanity
of
largelady
park
and
finished
her
it
exasperated
her
to
think
that
the
dungeon
in
which
she
had
languished
for
so
many
unhappy
years
had
been
unlocked
all
the
time
and
that
the
impulses
she
had
so
carefully
struggled
with
and
stifled
for
the
sake
of
keeping
well
with
society
were
precisely
those
by
which
alone
she
could
have
come
into
any
sort
of
sincere
human
contact
in
the
radiance
of
these
discoveries
and
the
tumult
of
their
reaction
she
made
a
fool
of
herself
as
freely
and
conspicuously
as
when
she
so
rashly
adopted
eliza
expletive
in
higgins
for
the
wellsian
had
to
find
her
bearings
almost
as
ridiculously
as
a
baby
but
nobody
hates
a
baby
for
its
ineptitudes
or
thinks
the
worse
of
it
for
trying
to
eat
the
matches
and
clara
lost
no
friends
by
her
follies
they
laughed
at
her
to
her
face
this
time
and
she
had
to
defend
herself
and
fight
it
out
as
best
she
could
when
freddy
paid
a
visit
to
earlscourt
which
he
never
did
when
he
could
possibly
help
it
to
make
the
desolating
announcement
that
he
and
his
eliza
were
thinking
of
blackening
the
largelady
scutcheon
by
opening
a
shop
he
found
the
little
household
already
convulsed
by
a
prior
announcement
from
clara
that
she
also
was
going
to
work
in
an
old
furniture
shop
in
dover
street
which
had
been
started
by
a
fellow
wellsian
this
appointment
clara
owed
after
all
to
her
old
social
accomplishment
of
push
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
cost
what
it
might
she
would
see
wells
in
the
flesh
and
she
had
achieved
her
end
at
a
garden
party
she
had
better
luck
than
so
rash
an
enterprise
deserved
wells
came
up
to
her
expectations
age
had
not
withered
him
nor
could
custom
stale
his
infinite
variety
in
half
an
hour
his
pleasant
neatness
and
compactness
his
small
hands
and
feet
his
teeming
ready
brain
his
unaffected
accessibility
and
a
certain
fine
apprehensiveness
which
stamped
him
as
susceptible
from
his
topmost
hair
to
his
tipmost
toe
proved
irresistible
clara
talked
of
nothing
else
for
weeks
and
weeks
afterwards
and
as
she
happened
to
talk
to
the
lady
of
the
furniture
shop
and
that
lady
also
desired
above
all
things
to
know
wells
and
sell
pretty
things
to
him
she
offered
clara
a
job
on
the
chance
of
achieving
that
end
through
her
and
so
it
came
about
that
eliza
luck
held
and
the
expected
opposition
to
the
flower
shop
melted
away
the
shop
is
in
the
arcade
of
a
railway
station
not
very
far
from
the
victoria
and
albert
museum
and
if
you
live
in
that
neighborhood
you
may
go
there
any
day
and
buy
a
buttonhole
from
eliza
now
here
is
a
last
opportunity
for
romance
would
you
not
like
to
be
assured
that
the
shop
was
an
immense
success
thanks
to
eliza
charms
and
her
early
business
experience
in
covent
garden
alas
the
truth
is
the
truth
the
shop
did
not
pay
for
a
long
time
simply
because
eliza
and
her
freddy
did
not
know
how
to
keep
it
true
eliza
had
not
to
begin
at
the
very
beginning
she
knew
the
names
and
prices
of
the
cheaper
flowers
and
her
elation
was
unbounded
when
she
found
that
freddy
like
all
youths
educated
at
cheap
pretentious
and
thoroughly
inefficient
schools
knew
a
little
latin
it
was
very
little
but
enough
to
make
him
appear
to
her
a
porson
or
bentley
and
to
put
him
at
his
ease
with
botanical
nomenclature
unfortunately
he
knew
nothing
else
and
eliza
though
she
could
count
money
up
to
eighteen
shillings
or
so
and
had
acquired
a
certain
familiarity
with
the
language
of
milton
from
her
struggles
to
qualify
herself
for
winning
higgins
bet
could
not
write
out
a
bill
without
utterly
disgracing
the
establishment
freddy
power
of
stating
in
latin
that
balbus
built
a
wall
and
that
gaul
was
divided
into
three
parts
did
not
carry
with
it
the
slightest
knowledge
of
accounts
or
business
colonel
pickering
had
to
explain
to
him
what
a
cheque
book
and
a
bank
account
meant
and
the
pair
were
by
no
means
easily
teachable
freddy
backed
up
eliza
in
her
obstinate
refusal
to
believe
that
they
could
save
money
by
engaging
a
bookkeeper
with
some
knowledge
of
the
business
how
they
argued
could
you
possibly
save
money
by
going
to
extra
expense
when
you
already
could
not
make
both
ends
meet
but
the
colonel
after
making
the
ends
meet
over
and
over
again
at
last
gently
insisted
and
eliza
humbled
to
the
dust
by
having
to
beg
from
him
so
often
and
stung
by
the
uproarious
derision
of
higgins
to
whom
the
notion
of
freddy
succeeding
at
anything
was
a
joke
that
never
palled
grasped
the
fact
that
business
like
phonetics
has
to
be
learned
on
the
piteous
spectacle
of
the
pair
spending
their
evenings
in
shorthand
schools
and
polytechnic
classes
learning
bookkeeping
and
typewriting
with
incipient
junior
clerks
male
and
female
from
the
elementary
schools
let
me
not
dwell
there
were
even
classes
at
the
london
school
of
economics
and
a
humble
personal
appeal
to
the
director
of
that
institution
to
recommend
a
course
bearing
on
the
flower
business
he
being
a
humorist
explained
to
them
the
method
of
the
celebrated
dickensian
essay
on
chinese
metaphysics
by
the
gentleman
who
read
an
article
on
china
and
an
article
on
metaphysics
and
combined
the
information
he
suggested
that
they
should
combine
the
london
school
with
kew
gardens
eliza
to
whom
the
procedure
of
the
dickensian
gentleman
seemed
perfectly
correct
as
in
fact
it
was
and
not
in
the
least
funny
which
was
only
her
ignorance
took
his
advice
with
entire
gravity
but
the
effort
that
cost
her
the
deepest
humiliation
was
a
request
to
higgins
whose
pet
artistic
fancy
next
to
milton
verse
was
calligraphy
and
who
himself
wrote
a
most
beautiful
italian
hand
that
he
would
teach
her
to
write
he
declared
that
she
was
congenitally
incapable
of
forming
a
single
letter
worthy
of
the
least
of
words
but
she
persisted
and
again
he
suddenly
threw
himself
into
the
task
of
teaching
her
with
a
combination
of
stormy
intensity
concentrated
patience
and
occasional
bursts
of
interesting
disquisition
on
the
beauty
and
nobility
the
august
mission
and
destiny
of
human
handwriting
eliza
ended
by
acquiring
an
extremely
uncommercial
script
which
was
a
positive
extension
of
her
personal
beauty
and
spending
three
times
as
much
on
stationery
as
anyone
else
because
certain
qualities
and
shapes
of
paper
became
indispensable
to
her
she
could
not
even
address
an
envelope
in
the
usual
way
because
it
made
the
margins
all
wrong
their
commercial
school
days
were
a
period
of
disgrace
and
despair
for
the
young
couple
they
seemed
to
be
learning
nothing
about
flower
shops
at
last
they
gave
it
up
as
hopeless
and
shook
the
dust
of
the
shorthand
schools
and
the
polytechnics
and
the
london
school
of
economics
from
their
feet
for
ever
besides
the
business
was
in
some
mysterious
way
beginning
to
take
care
of
itself
they
had
somehow
forgotten
their
objections
to
employing
other
people
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
their
own
way
was
the
best
and
that
they
had
really
a
remarkable
talent
for
business
the
colonel
who
had
been
compelled
for
some
years
to
keep
a
sufficient
sum
on
current
account
at
his
bankers
to
make
up
their
deficits
found
that
the
provision
was
unnecessary
the
young
people
were
prospering
it
is
true
that
there
was
not
quite
fair
play
between
them
and
their
competitors
in
trade
their
in
the
country
cost
them
nothing
and
saved
them
the
price
of
their
sunday
dinners
for
the
motor
car
was
the
colonel
and
he
and
higgins
paid
the
hotel
bills
hill
florist
and
greengrocer
they
soon
discovered
that
there
was
money
in
asparagus
and
asparagus
led
to
other
vegetables
had
an
air
which
stamped
the
business
as
classy
and
in
private
life
he
was
still
frederick
eynsford
hill
esquire
not
that
there
was
any
swank
about
him
nobody
but
eliza
knew
that
he
had
been
christened
frederick
challoner
eliza
herself
swanked
like
anything
that
is
all
that
is
how
it
has
turned
out
it
is
astonishing
how
much
eliza
still
manages
to
meddle
in
the
housekeeping
at
wimpole
street
in
spite
of
the
shop
and
her
own
family
and
it
is
notable
that
though
she
never
nags
her
husband
and
frankly
loves
the
colonel
as
if
she
were
his
favorite
daughter
she
has
never
got
out
of
the
habit
of
nagging
higgins
that
was
established
on
the
fatal
night
when
she
won
his
bet
for
him
she
snaps
his
head
off
on
the
faintest
provocation
or
on
none
he
no
longer
dares
to
tease
her
by
assuming
an
abysmal
inferiority
of
freddy
mind
to
his
own
he
storms
and
bullies
and
derides
but
she
stands
up
to
him
so
ruthlessly
that
the
colonel
has
to
ask
her
from
time
to
time
to
be
kinder
to
higgins
and
it
is
the
only
request
of
his
that
brings
a
mulish
expression
into
her
face
nothing
but
some
emergency
or
calamity
great
enough
to
break
down
all
likes
and
dislikes
and
throw
them
both
back
on
their
common
humanity
and
may
they
be
spared
any
such
trial
will
ever
alter
this
she
knows
that
higgins
does
not
need
her
just
as
her
father
did
not
need
her
the
very
scrupulousness
with
which
he
told
her
that
day
that
he
had
become
used
to
having
her
there
and
dependent
on
her
for
all
sorts
of
little
services
and
that
he
should
miss
her
if
she
went
away
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
freddy
or
the
colonel
to
say
anything
of
the
sort
deepens
her
inner
certainty
that
she
is
no
more
to
him
than
them
slippers
yet
she
has
a
sense
too
that
his
indifference
is
deeper
than
the
infatuation
of
commoner
souls
she
is
immensely
interested
in
him
she
has
even
secret
mischievous
moments
in
which
she
wishes
she
could
get
him
alone
on
a
desert
island
away
from
all
ties
and
with
nobody
else
in
the
world
to
consider
and
just
drag
him
off
his
pedestal
and
see
him
making
love
like
any
common
man
we
all
have
private
imaginations
of
that
sort
but
when
it
comes
to
business
to
the
life
that
she
really
leads
as
distinguished
from
the
life
of
dreams
and
fancies
she
likes
freddy
and
she
likes
the
colonel
and
she
does
not
like
higgins
and
doolittle
galatea
never
does
quite
like
pygmalion
his
relation
to
her
is
too
godlike
to
be
altogether
agreeable
