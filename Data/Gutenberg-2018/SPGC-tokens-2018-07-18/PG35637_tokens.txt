starrett
note
of
the
schoolmasters
in
the
secret
glory
has
views
on
the
subject
of
football
similar
to
those
entertained
by
a
schoolmaster
whose
biography
appeared
many
years
ago
that
is
the
only
link
between
the
villain
of
invention
and
the
good
man
of
real
preface
years
ago
i
met
my
old
master
sir
frank
benson
he
was
benson
then
and
he
asked
me
in
his
friendly
way
what
i
had
been
doing
i
am
just
finishing
a
book
i
replied
a
book
that
everybody
will
hate
as
usual
said
the
don
quixote
of
our
english
stage
if
i
knew
any
nobler
title
to
bestow
upon
him
i
would
bestow
it
as
usual
running
your
head
against
a
stone
wall
i
do
know
about
as
usual
there
may
be
something
to
be
said
for
the
personal
criticism
or
there
may
not
but
it
has
struck
me
that
sir
frank
remark
is
a
very
good
description
of
the
secret
glory
the
book
i
had
in
mind
as
i
talked
to
him
it
is
emphatically
the
history
of
an
unfortunate
fellow
who
ran
his
head
against
stone
walls
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
he
could
think
nothing
and
do
nothing
after
the
common
fashion
of
the
world
even
when
he
went
wrong
he
did
so
in
a
highly
unusual
and
eccentric
manner
it
will
be
for
the
reader
to
determine
whether
he
were
a
saint
who
had
lost
his
way
in
the
centuries
or
merely
an
undeveloped
lunatic
i
hold
no
passionate
view
on
either
side
in
every
age
there
are
people
great
and
small
for
whom
the
times
are
out
of
joint
for
whom
everything
is
somehow
wrong
and
askew
consider
hamlet
an
amiable
man
and
an
intelligent
man
but
what
a
mess
he
made
of
it
fortunately
my
hero
or
idiot
which
you
will
was
not
called
upon
to
intermeddle
with
affairs
of
state
and
so
only
brought
himself
to
grief
if
it
were
grief
for
the
least
chink
of
the
door
should
be
kept
open
i
am
inclined
to
hold
for
the
other
point
of
view
i
have
just
been
rereading
kipling
the
miracle
of
purun
bhagat
the
tale
of
the
brahmin
prime
minister
of
the
native
state
in
india
who
saw
all
the
world
and
the
glory
of
it
in
the
west
as
well
as
in
the
east
and
suddenly
abjured
all
to
become
a
hermit
in
the
wood
was
he
mad
or
was
he
supremely
wise
it
is
just
a
matter
of
origin
and
genesis
of
the
secret
glory
were
odd
enough
once
on
a
time
i
read
the
life
of
a
famous
schoolmaster
one
of
the
most
notable
schoolmasters
of
these
later
days
i
believe
he
was
an
excellent
man
in
every
way
but
somehow
that
life
got
on
my
nerves
i
thought
that
the
school
songs
for
which
amongst
other
things
this
master
was
famous
were
drivel
i
thought
his
views
about
football
regarded
not
as
a
good
game
but
as
the
discipline
and
guide
of
life
were
rot
and
poisonous
rot
at
that
in
a
word
the
life
of
this
excellent
man
got
my
back
good
the
year
after
schoolmasters
and
football
had
ceased
to
engage
my
attention
i
was
deeply
interested
in
a
curious
and
minute
investigation
of
the
wonderful
legend
of
the
holy
grail
or
rather
in
one
aspect
of
that
extraordinary
complex
my
researches
led
me
to
the
connection
of
the
grail
legend
with
the
vanished
celtic
church
which
held
the
field
in
britain
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
i
undertook
an
extraordinary
and
fascinating
journey
into
a
misty
and
uncertain
region
of
christian
history
i
must
not
say
more
here
lest
as
nurse
says
to
the
troublesome
and
persistent
child
i
begin
all
over
again
but
indeed
it
was
a
voyage
on
perilous
seas
a
journey
to
faery
lands
forlorn
and
i
would
declare
by
the
way
my
conviction
that
if
there
had
been
no
celtic
church
keats
could
never
have
written
those
lines
of
tremendous
evocation
and
very
good
the
year
after
it
came
upon
me
to
write
a
book
and
i
hit
upon
an
original
plan
or
so
i
thought
i
took
my
dislike
of
the
good
schoolmaster
life
i
took
my
knowledge
of
celtic
mysteries
and
combined
my
this
plan
it
was
all
thought
of
years
before
i
was
born
do
you
remember
the
critic
of
the
eatanswill
gazette
he
had
to
review
for
that
admirable
journal
a
work
on
chinese
metaphysics
pott
tells
the
story
of
the
he
read
up
for
the
subject
at
my
desire
in
the
encyclop√¶dia
britannica
he
read
for
metaphysics
under
the
letter
m
and
for
china
under
the
letter
c
and
combined
his
information
the
secret
glory
i
a
heavy
cloud
passed
swiftly
away
before
the
wind
that
came
with
the
night
and
far
in
a
clear
sky
the
evening
star
shone
with
pure
brightness
a
gleaming
world
set
high
above
the
dark
earth
and
the
black
shadows
in
the
lane
in
the
ending
of
october
a
great
storm
had
blown
from
the
west
and
it
was
through
the
bare
boughs
of
a
twisted
oak
that
ambrose
meyrick
saw
the
silver
light
of
the
star
as
the
last
faint
flash
died
in
the
sky
he
leaned
against
a
gate
and
gazed
upward
and
then
his
eyes
fell
on
the
dull
and
weary
undulations
of
the
land
the
vast
circle
of
dun
ploughland
and
grey
meadow
bounded
by
a
dim
horizon
dreary
as
a
prison
wall
he
remembered
with
a
start
how
late
it
must
be
he
should
have
been
back
an
hour
before
and
he
was
still
in
the
open
country
a
mile
away
at
least
from
the
outskirts
of
lupton
he
turned
from
the
star
and
began
to
walk
as
quickly
as
he
could
along
the
lane
through
the
puddles
and
the
sticky
clay
soaked
with
three
weeks
heavy
rain
he
saw
at
last
the
faint
lamps
of
the
nearest
streets
where
the
shoemakers
lived
and
he
tramped
hurriedly
through
this
wretched
quarter
past
its
penny
shops
its
raw
its
rawer
chapel
with
twelve
on
which
are
written
the
names
of
the
twelve
leading
congregationalists
of
lupton
past
the
squalling
children
whose
mothers
were
raiding
and
harrying
them
to
bed
then
came
the
free
library
an
admirable
instance
as
the
declared
of
the
adaptation
of
gothic
to
modern
requirements
from
a
sort
of
tower
of
this
building
a
great
arm
shot
out
and
hung
a
round
over
the
street
and
meyrick
experienced
another
shock
when
he
saw
that
it
was
even
later
than
he
had
feared
he
had
to
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
town
and
it
was
past
seven
already
he
began
to
run
wondering
what
his
fate
would
be
at
his
uncle
hands
and
he
went
by
our
grand
old
parish
church
completely
restored
in
the
early
past
the
remains
of
the
converted
most
successfully
according
to
local
opinion
into
a
drinking
fountain
for
dogs
and
cattle
dodging
his
way
among
the
late
shoppers
and
the
early
loafers
who
lounged
to
and
fro
along
the
high
street
he
shuddered
as
he
rang
the
bell
at
the
old
grange
he
tried
to
put
a
bold
face
on
it
when
the
servant
opened
the
door
and
he
would
have
gone
straight
down
the
hall
into
the
schoolroom
but
the
girl
stopped
him
master
said
you
to
go
to
the
study
at
once
master
meyrick
as
soon
as
ever
you
come
in
she
was
looking
strangely
at
him
and
the
boy
grew
sick
with
dread
he
was
a
funk
through
and
through
and
was
frightened
out
of
his
wits
about
twelve
times
a
day
every
day
of
his
life
his
uncle
had
said
a
few
years
before
lupton
will
make
a
man
of
you
and
lupton
was
doing
its
best
the
face
of
the
miserable
wretch
whitened
and
grew
wet
there
was
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
and
he
felt
very
cold
nelly
foran
the
maid
still
looked
at
him
with
strange
eager
eyes
then
whispered
suddenly
you
must
go
directly
master
meyrick
master
heard
the
bell
i
know
but
i
make
it
up
to
you
ambrose
understood
nothing
except
the
approach
of
doom
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
knocked
at
the
study
door
and
entered
on
his
command
it
was
an
extremely
comfortable
room
the
red
curtains
were
drawn
close
shutting
out
the
dreary
night
and
there
was
a
great
fire
of
coal
that
bubbled
unctuously
and
shot
out
great
jets
of
flame
in
the
schoolroom
they
used
coke
the
carpet
was
soft
to
the
feet
and
the
chairs
promised
softness
to
the
body
and
the
walls
were
well
furnished
with
books
there
were
thackeray
dickens
lord
lytton
uniform
in
red
morocco
gilt
extra
the
cambridge
bible
for
students
in
many
volumes
of
coplestone
commentaries
dictionaries
first
editions
of
tennyson
school
and
college
prizes
in
calf
and
of
course
a
great
brigade
of
latin
and
greek
classics
three
of
the
wonderful
and
terrible
pictures
of
piranesi
hung
in
the
room
these
horbury
admired
more
for
the
than
for
the
treatment
in
which
he
found
as
he
said
a
certain
lack
of
the
almost
indeed
a
touch
of
morbidity
the
gas
was
turned
low
for
the
high
usher
was
writing
at
his
desk
and
a
shaded
lamp
cast
a
bright
circle
of
light
on
a
mass
of
papers
he
turned
round
as
ambrose
meyrick
came
in
he
had
a
high
bald
forehead
and
his
face
was
edged
with
reddish
whiskers
there
was
a
dangerous
glint
in
his
eyes
and
his
opening
sentence
was
unpromising
now
ambrose
you
must
understand
quite
definitely
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
not
going
to
be
tolerated
any
longer
perhaps
it
would
not
have
fared
quite
so
badly
with
the
unhappy
lad
if
only
his
uncle
had
not
lunched
with
the
head
there
was
a
concatenation
accordingly
every
link
in
which
had
helped
to
make
ambrose
position
hopeless
in
the
first
place
there
was
boiled
mutton
for
luncheon
and
this
was
a
dish
hateful
to
horbury
palate
secondly
the
wine
was
sherry
of
this
horbury
was
very
fond
but
unfortunately
the
head
sherry
though
making
a
specious
appeal
to
the
taste
was
in
reality
far
from
good
and
teemed
with
those
fiery
and
irritating
spirits
which
make
the
liver
to
burn
and
rage
then
chesson
had
practically
found
fault
with
his
chief
assistant
work
he
had
not
of
course
told
him
in
so
many
words
that
he
was
unable
to
teach
he
had
merely
remarked
i
do
know
whether
you
noticed
it
horbury
but
it
struck
me
the
other
day
that
there
was
a
certain
lack
of
grip
about
those
fellows
of
yours
in
the
fifth
some
of
them
struck
me
as
if
you
know
what
i
mean
there
was
a
sort
of
for
example
about
their
construing
in
that
chorus
have
you
remarked
anything
of
the
kind
yourself
and
then
again
the
head
had
gone
on
and
by
the
way
horbury
i
do
quite
know
what
to
make
of
your
nephew
meyrick
he
was
your
wife
nephew
was
he
yes
well
i
hardly
know
whether
i
can
explain
what
i
feel
about
the
boy
but
i
help
saying
that
there
is
something
wrong
about
him
his
work
strikes
me
as
good
enough
in
fact
quite
above
the
form
average
but
to
use
the
musical
term
he
seems
to
be
in
the
wrong
key
of
course
it
may
be
my
fancy
but
the
lad
reminds
me
of
those
very
objectionable
persons
who
are
said
to
have
a
joke
up
their
sleeve
i
doubt
whether
he
is
taking
the
lupton
stamp
and
when
he
gets
up
in
the
school
i
shall
be
afraid
of
his
influence
on
the
other
boys
here
again
the
master
detected
a
note
of
blame
and
by
the
time
he
reached
the
old
grange
he
was
in
an
evil
humour
he
hardly
knew
which
he
found
the
more
offensive
chesson
dish
or
his
discourse
he
was
a
dainty
man
in
his
feeding
and
the
thought
of
the
great
fat
gigot
pouring
out
a
thin
red
stream
from
the
gaping
wound
dealt
to
it
by
the
head
mingled
with
his
resentment
of
the
indirect
scolding
which
he
considered
that
he
had
received
and
on
the
fire
just
kindled
every
drop
of
that
corrosive
sherry
was
oil
he
drank
his
tea
in
black
silence
his
rage
growing
fiercer
for
want
of
vent
and
it
is
doubtful
whether
in
his
inmost
heart
he
was
altogether
displeased
when
report
was
made
at
six
that
meyrick
had
not
come
in
he
saw
a
prospect
more
than
a
prospect
of
satisfactory
relief
some
philosophers
have
affirmed
that
lunatic
doctors
or
mental
specialists
grow
in
time
to
a
certain
resemblance
to
their
patients
or
in
more
direct
language
become
half
mad
themselves
there
seems
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
the
position
indeed
it
is
probably
a
more
noxious
madness
to
swear
a
man
into
perpetual
imprisonment
in
the
company
of
maniacs
and
imbeciles
because
he
sings
in
his
bath
and
will
wear
a
purple
at
dinner
than
to
fancy
oneself
emperor
of
china
however
this
may
be
it
is
very
certain
that
in
many
cases
the
schoolmaster
is
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
bloated
schoolboy
the
beasts
are
radically
the
same
but
morbid
conditions
have
increased
the
venom
of
the
former
sting
indeed
it
is
not
uncommon
for
to
the
great
public
school
system
to
praise
their
favourite
masters
in
terms
which
admit
nay
glory
in
this
identity
read
the
memorial
tributes
to
departed
heads
in
a
and
most
respectable
church
paper
to
the
last
he
was
a
big
boy
at
heart
writes
canon
diver
of
his
friend
that
illiterate
old
sycophant
who
brought
up
the
numbers
of
the
school
to
such
a
pitch
by
means
of
his
conciliator
policy
to
jews
turks
heretics
and
infidels
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
him
a
bishop
i
always
thought
he
seemed
more
at
home
in
the
playing
fields
than
in
the
room
he
had
all
the
english
boy
healthy
horror
of
anything
approaching
pose
or
eccentricity
he
could
be
a
severe
disciplinarian
when
severity
seemed
necessary
but
everybody
in
the
school
knew
that
a
a
difficult
catch
or
a
goal
well
won
or
well
averted
would
atone
for
all
but
the
most
serious
offences
there
are
many
other
points
of
resemblance
between
the
average
master
and
the
average
boy
each
for
example
is
intensely
cruel
and
experiences
a
quite
abnormal
joy
in
the
infliction
of
pain
the
baser
boy
tortures
those
animals
which
are
not
tales
have
been
told
they
are
hushed
up
by
all
true
friends
of
the
system
of
wonderful
and
exquisite
orgies
in
lonely
hollows
of
the
moors
in
obscure
and
hidden
thickets
tales
of
a
boy
or
two
a
lizard
or
a
toad
and
the
slow
simmering
heat
of
a
bonfire
but
these
are
the
exceptional
pleasures
of
the
for
the
average
lad
there
is
plenty
of
fun
to
be
got
out
of
his
feebler
fellows
of
whom
there
are
generally
a
few
even
in
the
healthiest
community
after
all
the
weakest
must
go
to
the
wall
and
if
the
bones
of
the
weakest
are
ground
in
the
process
that
is
their
fault
when
some
miserable
little
wretch
after
a
year
or
two
of
prolonged
and
exquisite
torture
of
body
and
mind
seeks
the
last
escape
of
suicide
one
knows
how
the
old
boys
will
come
forward
how
gallantly
they
will
declare
that
the
days
at
the
dear
old
school
were
the
happiest
in
their
lives
how
the
doctor
was
their
father
and
the
sixth
their
how
the
delights
of
the
mahomedans
fabled
paradise
are
but
grey
and
weary
sport
compared
with
the
joys
of
the
happy
fag
whose
heart
as
the
inspired
bard
of
harrow
tells
us
will
thrill
in
future
years
at
the
thought
of
the
hill
they
write
from
all
quarters
these
brave
old
boys
from
the
deanery
result
of
many
years
of
indefatigable
attack
on
the
fundamental
doctrines
of
the
christian
faith
from
the
comfortable
villa
the
reward
of
commercial
activity
and
acuteness
on
the
stock
exchange
from
the
courts
and
from
the
camps
from
all
the
high
seats
of
the
successful
and
common
to
them
all
is
the
convincing
argument
of
praise
and
we
all
agree
and
say
there
is
nothing
like
our
great
public
schools
and
perhaps
the
only
dissentient
voices
are
those
of
the
father
and
mother
who
bury
the
body
of
a
little
child
about
whose
neck
is
the
black
sign
of
the
rope
but
let
them
be
comforted
the
boy
was
no
good
at
games
though
his
torments
were
not
bad
sport
while
he
lasted
horbury
was
an
old
luptonian
he
was
in
the
words
of
canon
diver
but
a
big
boy
at
heart
and
so
he
gave
orders
that
meyrick
was
to
be
sent
in
the
study
directly
he
came
in
and
he
looked
at
the
clock
on
the
desk
before
him
with
satisfaction
and
yet
with
impatience
a
hungry
man
may
long
for
his
delayed
dinner
almost
with
a
sense
of
fury
and
yet
at
the
back
of
his
mind
he
can
not
help
being
consoled
by
the
thought
of
how
wonderfully
he
will
enjoy
the
soup
when
it
appears
at
last
when
seven
struck
horbury
moistened
his
lips
slightly
he
got
up
and
felt
cautiously
behind
one
of
the
bookshelves
the
object
was
there
and
he
sat
down
again
he
listened
there
were
footfalls
on
the
drive
ah
there
was
the
expected
ring
there
was
a
brief
interval
and
then
a
knock
the
fire
was
glowing
with
red
flashes
and
the
wretched
toad
was
secured
now
ambrose
you
must
understand
quite
definitely
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
going
to
be
tolerated
any
longer
this
is
the
third
time
during
this
term
that
you
have
been
late
for
lockup
you
know
the
rules
six
at
latest
it
is
now
twenty
minutes
past
seven
what
excuse
have
you
to
make
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
have
you
been
in
the
fields
no
sir
why
not
you
must
have
seen
the
resolution
of
the
sixth
on
the
of
the
high
school
you
know
what
it
promised
any
boy
who
shirked
rocker
good
sound
thrashing
with
tuds
before
the
first
thirty
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
a
very
bad
time
of
it
on
monday
after
graham
has
sent
up
your
name
to
the
room
there
was
a
pause
horbury
looked
quietly
and
lengthily
at
the
boy
who
stood
white
and
sick
before
him
he
was
a
rather
sallow
ugly
lad
of
fifteen
there
was
something
of
intelligence
in
his
expression
and
it
was
this
glance
that
chesson
the
headmaster
had
resented
his
heart
beat
against
his
breast
his
breath
came
in
gasps
and
the
sweat
of
terror
poured
down
his
body
the
master
gazed
at
him
and
at
last
spoke
again
but
what
have
you
been
doing
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
if
you
please
sir
i
walked
over
to
selden
abbey
to
selden
abbey
why
it
at
least
six
miles
away
what
on
earth
did
you
want
to
go
to
selden
abbey
for
are
you
fond
of
old
stones
if
you
please
sir
i
wanted
to
see
the
norman
arches
there
is
a
picture
of
them
in
oh
i
see
you
are
a
budding
antiquarian
are
you
ambrose
with
an
interest
in
norman
arches
eh
i
suppose
we
are
to
look
forward
to
the
time
when
your
researches
will
have
made
lupton
famous
perhaps
you
would
like
to
lecture
to
the
school
on
paul
cathedral
pray
what
are
your
views
as
to
the
age
of
stonehenge
the
wit
was
heavy
enough
but
the
speaker
position
gave
a
bitter
sting
to
his
lash
horbury
saw
that
every
cut
had
told
and
without
prejudice
to
more
immediate
and
acuter
pleasures
he
resolved
that
such
biting
satire
must
have
a
larger
audience
indeed
it
was
a
long
time
before
ambrose
meyrick
heard
the
last
of
those
wretched
norman
arches
the
method
was
absurdly
easy
openings
presented
themselves
every
day
for
example
if
the
boy
made
a
mistake
in
construing
the
retort
was
obvious
thank
you
meyrick
for
your
most
original
ideas
on
the
force
of
the
aorist
perhaps
if
you
studied
your
greek
grammar
a
little
more
and
your
favourite
of
a
little
less
it
would
be
the
better
write
out
means
indefinite
five
hundred
times
or
again
perhaps
the
classic
orders
were
referred
to
horbury
would
begin
to
instruct
the
form
as
to
the
difference
between
ionic
and
doric
the
form
listened
with
poor
imitation
of
interest
suddenly
the
master
would
break
off
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
forgetting
that
we
have
a
great
architectural
authority
amongst
us
be
so
kind
as
to
instruct
us
meyrick
what
does
parker
say
or
perhaps
you
have
excogitated
some
theories
of
your
own
i
know
you
have
an
original
mind
from
the
extraordinary
quantities
of
your
last
copy
of
verse
by
the
way
i
must
ask
you
to
write
out
in
is
short
five
hundred
times
i
am
sorry
to
interfere
with
your
more
important
architectural
studies
but
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
help
for
it
and
so
on
while
the
form
howled
with
amusement
but
horbury
kept
these
gems
for
future
and
public
use
for
the
moment
he
had
more
exciting
work
on
hand
he
burst
out
suddenly
the
fact
is
ambrose
meyrick
you
a
miserable
little
humbug
you
have
the
honesty
to
say
fair
and
square
that
you
funked
rocker
and
went
loafing
about
the
country
looking
for
any
mischief
you
could
lay
your
hands
on
instead
of
that
you
make
up
this
story
of
selden
abbey
and
norman
arches
as
if
any
boy
in
his
senses
ever
knew
or
cared
twopence
about
such
things
i
hope
you
have
been
spending
the
afternoon
in
some
low
there
do
speak
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
lies
but
whatever
you
have
been
doing
you
have
broken
the
rules
and
you
must
be
taught
that
the
rules
have
to
be
kept
stand
still
horbury
went
to
the
bookshelf
and
drew
out
the
object
he
stood
at
a
little
distance
behind
meyrick
and
opened
proceedings
with
a
savage
cut
at
his
right
arm
well
above
the
elbow
then
it
was
the
turn
of
the
left
arm
and
the
master
felt
the
cane
bite
so
pleasantly
into
the
flesh
that
he
distributed
some
dozen
cuts
between
the
two
arms
then
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
lad
thighs
and
finished
up
in
the
orthodox
manner
meyrick
bending
over
a
chair
the
boy
whole
body
was
one
mass
of
burning
stinging
torture
and
though
he
had
not
uttered
a
sound
during
the
process
the
tears
were
streaming
down
his
cheeks
it
was
not
the
bodily
anguish
though
that
was
extreme
enough
so
much
as
a
recollection
he
was
quite
a
little
boy
and
his
father
dead
long
since
was
showing
him
the
western
doorway
of
a
grey
church
on
a
high
hill
and
carefully
instructing
him
in
the
difference
between
billetty
and
chevronny
it
no
good
snivelling
you
know
ambrose
i
daresay
you
think
me
severe
but
though
you
wo
believe
me
now
the
day
will
come
when
you
will
thank
me
from
your
heart
for
what
i
have
just
done
let
this
day
be
a
in
your
life
now
go
to
your
work
ii
it
was
strange
but
meyrick
never
came
in
the
after
days
and
thanked
his
uncle
for
that
sharp
dose
of
physical
and
mental
pain
even
when
he
was
a
man
he
dreamed
of
horbury
and
woke
up
in
a
cold
sweat
and
then
would
fall
asleep
again
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
gladness
as
he
realised
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
power
of
that
infernal
old
swine
that
filthy
canting
cruel
brute
as
he
roughly
called
his
old
master
the
fact
was
as
some
old
luptonians
remarked
the
two
had
never
understood
one
another
with
the
majority
of
the
boys
the
high
usher
passed
for
a
popular
master
enough
he
had
been
a
distinguished
athlete
in
his
time
and
up
to
his
last
days
at
the
school
was
a
football
enthusiast
indeed
he
organised
a
variety
of
the
lupton
game
which
met
with
immense
popularity
till
the
head
was
reluctantly
compelled
to
stop
it
some
said
because
he
always
liked
to
drop
bitter
into
horbury
cup
when
possible
others
and
with
more
probability
on
their
side
maintained
that
it
was
in
consequence
of
a
report
received
from
the
school
doctor
to
the
effect
that
this
new
species
of
football
was
rapidly
setting
up
an
old
species
of
heart
disease
in
the
weaker
players
however
that
might
be
there
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
horbury
intense
and
devotion
to
the
school
his
father
had
been
a
luptonian
before
him
he
himself
had
gone
from
the
school
to
the
university
and
within
a
year
or
two
of
taking
his
degree
he
had
returned
to
lupton
to
serve
it
as
a
master
it
was
the
general
opinion
in
public
school
circles
that
the
high
usher
had
counted
for
as
much
as
chesson
the
headmaster
if
not
for
more
in
the
immense
advance
in
prestige
and
popularity
that
the
school
had
made
and
everybody
thought
that
when
chesson
received
the
episcopal
order
horbury
succession
was
a
certainty
unfortunately
however
there
were
wheels
within
wheels
and
a
total
stranger
was
appointed
a
man
who
knew
nothing
of
the
famous
lupton
traditions
who
it
was
whispered
had
been
heard
to
say
that
this
athletic
business
was
getting
a
bit
overdone
friends
were
furious
and
horbury
himself
it
was
supposed
was
bitterly
disappointed
he
retreated
to
one
of
the
few
decent
canonries
which
have
survived
the
wave
of
agricultural
depression
but
those
who
knew
him
best
doubted
whether
his
ecclesiastical
duties
were
an
adequate
consolation
for
the
loss
of
that
coveted
headmastership
of
lupton
to
quote
the
memoir
which
appeared
in
the
soon
after
his
death
over
some
initials
his
friends
were
shocked
when
they
saw
him
at
the
residence
he
seemed
no
longer
the
same
man
he
had
aged
more
in
six
months
as
some
of
them
expressed
themselves
than
in
the
dozen
years
before
the
old
joyous
horbury
full
of
mirth
an
apt
master
of
and
was
somehow
to
use
the
happy
phrase
of
a
former
colleague
the
dean
of
dorchester
old
boys
who
remembered
the
sparkle
of
his
wit
the
zest
which
he
threw
into
everything
making
the
most
ordinary
better
fun
than
the
games
at
other
schools
as
one
of
them
observed
missed
something
indefinable
from
the
man
whom
they
had
loved
so
long
and
so
well
one
of
them
who
had
perhaps
penetrated
as
closely
as
any
into
the
of
horbury
friendship
a
privilege
which
he
will
ever
esteem
as
one
of
the
greatest
blessings
of
his
life
tried
to
rouse
him
with
an
extravagant
rumour
which
was
then
going
the
round
of
the
popular
press
to
the
effect
that
considerable
modifications
were
about
to
be
introduced
into
the
compulsory
system
of
games
at
one
of
the
greatest
of
our
great
public
schools
horbury
flushed
the
old
light
came
into
his
eyes
his
friend
was
reminded
of
the
ancient
who
hears
once
more
the
inspiring
notes
of
the
trumpet
ca
believe
it
he
said
and
there
was
a
tremor
in
his
voice
would
dare
not
even
y
the
headmaster
of
x
would
do
such
a
scoundrelly
thing
as
that
i
believe
it
but
the
flush
soon
faded
and
his
apathy
returned
all
he
said
should
wonder
if
it
were
so
our
day
is
past
i
suppose
and
for
all
i
know
they
may
be
construing
the
breviary
and
playing
dominoes
at
in
a
few
years
time
i
am
afraid
that
those
last
years
at
wareham
were
far
from
happy
he
felt
i
think
out
of
tune
with
his
surroundings
and
the
readers
of
the
i
doubt
whether
he
was
ever
quite
at
home
in
his
stall
he
confessed
to
one
of
his
old
associates
that
he
doubted
the
wisdom
of
the
whole
cathedral
system
he
said
in
his
old
characteristic
manner
peter
say
if
he
could
enter
this
building
and
see
that
gorgeous
window
in
which
he
is
represented
with
mitre
cope
and
keys
and
i
do
not
think
that
he
was
ever
quite
reconciled
to
the
daily
recitation
of
the
liturgy
accompanied
as
it
is
in
such
establishments
by
elaborate
music
and
all
the
pomp
of
the
surpliced
choir
and
water
rome
and
water
he
has
been
heard
to
mutter
under
his
breath
as
the
procession
swept
up
the
nave
and
before
he
died
i
think
that
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
many
in
high
places
were
coming
round
to
his
views
but
to
the
very
last
he
never
forgot
lupton
a
year
or
two
before
he
died
he
wrote
the
great
school
song
follow
follow
he
was
pleased
i
know
when
it
appeared
in
the
and
a
famous
old
boy
informs
me
that
he
will
never
forget
horbury
delight
when
he
was
told
that
the
song
was
already
a
great
favourite
in
to
many
of
your
readers
the
words
will
be
familiar
but
i
can
not
resist
quoting
the
first
verse
i
am
getting
old
and
grey
and
the
hills
seem
far
away
and
i
can
not
hear
the
horn
that
once
proclaimed
the
morn
when
we
sallied
forth
upon
the
chase
together
for
the
years
are
gone
alack
when
we
hastened
on
the
track
and
the
huntsman
whip
went
crack
as
a
signal
to
our
pack
riding
in
the
sunshine
and
fair
weather
and
yet
across
the
ground
i
seem
to
hear
a
sound
a
sound
that
comes
up
floating
from
the
hollow
and
its
note
is
very
clear
as
it
echoes
in
my
ear
and
the
words
are
follow
follow
follow
lupton
follow
away
the
darkness
lies
behind
us
and
before
us
is
the
day
follow
follow
the
sun
the
whole
world
to
be
won
so
lupton
follow
follow
follow
follow
away
an
old
pupil
sang
this
verse
to
him
on
his
and
i
think
perhaps
that
some
at
least
of
the
readers
of
the
will
allow
that
george
horbury
died
in
the
truest
sense
the
rites
of
the
church
the
church
of
a
great
aspiration
such
was
the
impression
that
horbury
had
evidently
made
upon
some
of
his
oldest
friends
but
meyrick
was
to
the
last
an
infidel
he
read
the
verses
in
the
he
would
never
subscribe
to
the
and
jeered
savagely
at
the
whole
sentiment
of
the
memoir
and
at
the
poetry
too
is
it
incredible
he
would
say
let
allow
that
the
main
purpose
of
the
great
public
schools
is
to
breed
brave
average
boobies
by
means
of
rocker
sticker
and
mucker
and
the
rest
of
it
still
they
do
acknowledge
that
they
have
a
sort
of
the
teaching
of
two
great
literatures
two
literatures
that
have
moulded
the
whole
of
western
thought
for
more
than
two
thousand
years
and
they
pay
an
animal
like
this
to
teach
these
literatures
a
swine
that
has
not
enough
literature
of
any
kind
in
him
to
save
the
soul
of
a
louse
look
at
those
verses
why
a
decent
fourth
form
boy
would
be
ashamed
to
put
his
name
to
them
he
was
foolish
to
talk
in
this
fashion
people
merely
said
that
it
was
evident
he
was
one
of
the
failures
of
the
great
public
school
system
and
the
song
was
much
admired
in
the
right
circles
a
very
appeared
in
the
shortly
after
the
publication
of
the
memoir
and
the
initials
at
the
foot
of
the
version
were
recognised
as
those
of
a
literary
dean
and
on
that
autumn
evening
far
away
in
the
meyrick
the
boy
left
horbury
study
in
a
white
fury
of
grief
and
pain
and
rage
he
would
have
murdered
his
master
without
the
faintest
compunction
nay
with
huge
delight
psychologically
his
frame
of
mind
was
quite
interesting
though
he
was
only
a
schoolboy
who
had
just
had
a
sound
thrashing
for
breaking
rules
for
the
fact
of
course
was
that
horbury
the
irritating
influence
of
the
head
conversation
and
sherry
apart
was
by
no
means
a
bad
fellow
he
was
for
the
moment
savagely
cruel
but
then
most
men
are
apt
to
be
savagely
cruel
when
they
suffer
from
an
inflamed
liver
and
offensive
superiors
more
especially
when
there
is
an
inferior
warranted
defenceless
in
their
power
but
in
the
main
horbury
was
a
very
decent
specimen
of
his
class
english
schoolmaster
and
meyrick
would
never
allow
that
in
all
his
reasoning
about
schools
and
schoolmasters
there
was
a
fatal
flaw
he
blamed
both
for
not
being
what
they
never
pretended
to
be
to
use
a
figure
that
would
have
appealed
to
him
it
was
if
one
quarrelled
with
a
plain
because
it
was
not
in
the
least
like
lincoln
cathedral
a
chimney
may
not
be
a
decorative
object
but
then
it
does
not
profess
to
be
a
spire
or
a
pinnacle
far
in
the
spiritual
city
but
meyrick
was
always
scolding
because
they
were
not
cathedrals
he
has
been
heard
to
rave
for
hours
against
useful
unpretentious
because
they
bore
no
resemblance
to
celestial
spires
somehow
or
other
possibly
by
inheritance
possibly
by
the
influence
of
his
father
companionship
he
had
unconsciously
acquired
a
theory
of
life
which
bore
no
relation
whatever
to
the
facts
of
it
the
theory
was
manifest
in
his
later
years
but
it
must
have
been
stubbornly
if
vaguely
present
in
him
all
through
his
boyhood
take
for
instance
his
comment
on
poor
canon
horbury
verses
he
judged
those
as
we
have
seen
by
the
rules
of
the
fine
art
of
literature
and
found
them
rubbish
yet
any
old
luptonian
would
have
told
him
that
to
hear
the
whole
six
hundred
boys
join
in
the
chorus
lupton
follow
away
was
one
of
the
great
experiences
of
life
from
which
it
appears
that
the
song
whatever
its
demerits
from
a
literary
point
of
view
fully
satisfied
the
purpose
for
which
is
was
written
in
other
words
it
was
an
excellent
chimney
but
meyrick
still
persisted
in
his
easy
and
futile
task
of
proving
that
it
was
not
a
bit
like
a
spire
then
again
one
finds
a
fallacy
of
still
huger
extent
in
that
major
premiss
of
his
that
the
great
public
schools
purpose
to
themselves
as
a
secondary
and
minor
object
the
imparting
of
the
spirit
and
beauty
of
the
greek
and
latin
literatures
now
it
is
very
possible
that
at
some
distant
period
in
the
past
this
was
an
object
or
even
perhaps
object
of
the
institutions
in
question
the
humanists
it
may
be
conjectured
thought
of
school
and
university
as
places
where
latin
and
greek
were
to
be
learned
and
to
be
learned
with
the
object
of
enjoying
the
great
thought
and
the
great
style
of
an
antique
world
one
sees
the
spirit
of
this
in
rabelais
for
example
the
classics
are
a
wonderful
adventure
to
learn
to
understand
them
is
to
be
a
spiritual
columbus
a
discoverer
of
new
seas
and
unknown
continents
a
drinker
of
wine
in
a
land
to
the
student
of
those
days
a
mysterious
drowned
atlantis
again
rose
splendid
from
the
waves
of
the
great
deep
it
was
these
things
that
meyrick
unconsciously
doubtless
expected
to
find
in
his
school
life
it
was
for
the
absence
of
these
things
that
he
continued
to
scold
the
system
in
his
later
years
wherein
like
jim
in
he
missed
the
point
by
a
thousand
miles
the
latin
and
greek
of
modern
instruction
are
of
course
most
curious
and
interesting
survivals
no
longer
taught
with
any
view
of
enabling
students
to
enjoy
and
understand
either
the
thought
or
beauty
of
the
originals
taught
rather
in
such
a
manner
as
to
nauseate
the
learner
for
the
rest
of
his
days
with
the
very
notion
of
these
lessons
still
the
study
of
the
classics
survives
a
curious
and
elaborate
ritual
from
which
all
sense
and
spirit
have
departed
one
has
only
to
recollect
the
form
master
lessons
in
the
or
the
and
then
to
view
modern
celebrating
the
mystic
death
and
resurrection
of
hiram
abiff
the
analogy
is
complete
for
neither
the
master
nor
the
masons
have
the
remotest
notion
of
what
they
are
doing
both
persevere
in
strange
and
mysterious
actions
from
inveterate
conservatism
meyrick
was
a
lover
of
antiquity
and
a
special
lover
of
survivals
but
he
could
never
see
that
the
round
of
greek
syntax
and
latin
prose
of
elegiacs
and
verbs
in
greek
mi
with
the
mystery
of
the
oratio
obliqua
and
the
optative
was
one
of
the
most
strange
and
picturesque
survivals
of
modern
life
it
is
to
be
noted
by
the
way
that
the
very
meaning
of
the
word
scholar
has
been
radically
changed
thus
a
authority
points
out
that
melancholy
burton
had
no
scholarship
in
the
real
sense
of
the
word
he
merely
used
his
vast
knowledge
of
ancient
and
modern
literature
to
make
one
of
the
most
entertaining
and
curious
books
that
the
world
possesses
true
scholarship
in
the
modern
sense
is
to
be
sought
for
not
in
the
jacobean
translators
of
the
bible
but
in
the
victorian
revisers
the
former
made
the
greatest
of
english
books
out
of
their
hebrew
and
greek
originals
but
the
latter
understood
the
force
of
the
aorist
it
is
curious
to
reflect
that
scholar
once
meant
a
man
of
literary
taste
and
knowledge
meyrick
never
mastered
these
distinctions
or
if
he
did
so
in
later
years
he
never
confessed
to
his
enlightment
but
went
on
railing
at
the
which
he
still
maintained
pretend
to
be
a
cathedral
he
has
been
heard
to
wonder
why
a
certain
dean
who
had
pointed
out
the
vast
improvements
that
had
been
effected
by
the
revisers
did
not
employ
a
few
young
art
students
from
kensington
to
correct
the
infamous
drawing
of
the
glass
in
his
cathedral
he
was
incorrigible
he
was
always
incorrigible
and
thus
in
his
boyhood
on
the
dark
november
evening
he
meditated
the
murder
of
his
good
master
and
uncle
for
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
his
father
he
remembered
had
always
spoken
of
gothic
architecture
as
the
most
wonderful
and
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
a
thing
to
be
studied
and
loved
and
reverenced
his
father
had
never
so
much
as
mentioned
rocker
much
less
had
he
preached
it
as
the
one
way
by
which
an
english
boy
must
be
saved
hence
ambrose
maintained
inwardly
that
his
visit
to
selden
abbey
was
deserving
of
reward
rather
than
punishment
and
he
resented
bitterly
the
savage
injustice
as
he
thought
it
of
his
caning
iii
yet
horbury
had
been
right
in
one
matter
if
not
in
all
that
evening
was
a
in
meyrick
life
he
had
felt
the
utmost
rage
of
the
enemy
as
it
were
and
he
determined
that
he
would
be
a
funk
no
longer
he
would
not
degenerate
into
the
state
of
little
phipps
who
had
been
bullied
and
rockered
and
beaten
into
such
a
deplorable
condition
that
he
fainted
dead
away
while
the
headmaster
was
operating
on
him
for
systematic
and
deliberate
lying
phipps
not
only
fainted
but
being
fundamentally
sensible
as
johnson
expressed
it
showed
a
strong
disinclination
to
return
to
consciousness
and
the
precious
balms
of
the
dear
old
head
chesson
was
rather
frightened
and
the
school
doctor
who
had
his
living
to
get
said
somewhat
dryly
that
he
thought
the
lad
had
better
go
home
for
a
week
or
two
so
phipps
went
home
in
a
state
which
made
his
mother
cry
bitterly
and
his
father
wonder
whether
the
public
school
system
was
not
but
the
old
family
doctor
went
about
raging
and
swearing
at
the
scoundrels
who
had
reduced
a
child
of
twelve
to
a
nervous
wreck
with
neurasthenia
cerebralis
well
on
its
way
but
walford
had
got
his
education
in
some
trumpery
little
academy
and
did
not
understand
or
value
the
of
the
great
public
schools
now
ambrose
meyrick
had
marked
the
career
of
wretched
phipps
with
concern
and
pity
the
miserable
little
creature
had
been
brought
by
careful
handling
from
masters
and
boys
to
such
a
pitch
of
neurotic
perfection
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
tap
him
smartly
on
the
back
or
on
the
arm
and
he
would
instantly
burst
into
tears
whenever
anyone
asked
him
the
simplest
question
he
suspected
a
cruel
trap
of
some
sort
and
lied
and
equivocated
and
shuffled
with
a
pitiable
lack
of
skill
though
he
was
pitched
by
the
heels
into
mucker
about
three
times
a
week
that
he
might
acquire
the
useful
art
of
natation
he
still
seemed
to
grow
dirtier
and
dirtier
his
school
books
were
torn
to
bits
his
exercises
made
into
darts
he
had
impositions
for
losing
books
and
canings
for
not
doing
his
work
and
he
lied
and
cried
all
the
more
meyrick
had
never
got
to
this
depth
he
was
a
sturdy
boy
and
phipps
had
always
been
a
weakly
little
animal
but
as
he
walked
from
the
study
to
the
schoolroom
after
his
thrashing
he
felt
that
he
had
been
in
some
danger
of
descending
on
that
sad
way
he
finally
resolved
that
he
would
never
tread
it
and
so
he
walked
past
the
doors
into
the
room
where
the
other
boys
were
at
work
on
prep
with
an
air
of
unconcern
which
was
not
in
the
least
assumed
horbury
was
a
man
of
considerable
private
means
and
did
not
care
to
be
bothered
with
the
troubles
and
responsibilities
of
a
big
house
but
there
was
room
and
to
spare
in
the
old
grange
so
he
took
three
boys
besides
his
nephew
these
three
were
waiting
with
a
grin
of
anticipation
since
the
nature
of
meyrick
interview
with
old
horbury
was
not
dubious
but
ambrose
strolled
in
with
a
hallo
you
fellows
and
sat
down
in
his
place
as
if
nothing
had
happened
this
was
intolerable
i
say
meyrick
began
pelly
a
beefy
boy
with
a
red
face
you
been
blubbing
feel
like
writing
home
about
it
oh
i
forgot
this
is
your
home
is
it
how
many
cuts
i
did
hear
you
howl
the
boy
took
no
notice
he
was
getting
out
his
books
as
if
no
one
had
spoken
ca
you
answer
went
on
the
beefy
one
how
many
cuts
you
young
sneak
go
to
hell
the
whole
three
stared
aghast
for
a
moment
they
thought
meyrick
must
have
gone
mad
only
one
bates
the
observant
began
to
chuckle
quietly
to
himself
for
he
did
not
like
pelly
he
who
was
always
beefy
became
beefier
his
eyes
bulged
out
with
fury
i
give
it
you
he
said
and
made
for
ambrose
who
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
latin
dictionary
ambrose
did
not
wait
for
the
assault
he
rose
also
and
met
pelly
with
a
furious
blow
well
planted
on
the
nose
pelly
took
a
back
somersault
and
fell
with
a
crash
to
the
floor
where
he
lay
for
a
moment
half
stunned
he
rose
staggering
and
looked
about
him
with
a
pathetic
bewildered
air
for
indeed
a
great
part
of
his
little
world
had
crumbled
about
his
ears
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
wondering
what
it
meant
whether
it
was
true
indeed
that
meyrick
was
no
longer
of
any
use
for
a
little
quiet
fun
a
horrible
and
incredible
transmutation
had
apparently
been
effected
in
the
funk
of
old
pelly
gazed
wildly
about
him
as
he
tried
to
staunch
the
blood
that
poured
over
his
mouth
foul
blow
ventured
rawson
a
lean
lad
who
liked
to
twist
the
arms
of
very
little
boys
till
they
shrieked
for
mercy
the
full
inwardness
of
the
incident
had
not
penetrated
to
his
brain
he
saw
without
believing
in
the
manner
of
the
materialist
who
denies
the
marvellous
even
when
it
is
before
his
eyes
foul
blow
young
meyrick
the
quiet
student
had
gone
back
to
his
place
and
was
again
handling
his
dictionary
it
was
a
hard
compact
volume
rebound
in
strong
boards
and
the
edge
of
these
boards
caught
the
unfortunate
rawson
full
across
the
eyes
with
extraordinary
force
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
blubbered
quietly
and
dismally
rocking
to
and
fro
in
his
seat
hardly
hearing
the
fluent
stream
of
curses
with
which
the
quiet
student
inquired
whether
the
blow
he
had
just
had
was
good
enough
for
him
meyrick
picked
up
his
dictionary
with
a
volley
of
remarks
which
would
have
done
credit
to
an
at
the
last
dress
rehearsal
before
production
hark
at
him
said
pelly
feebly
almost
reverently
hark
at
him
but
poor
rawson
rocking
to
and
fro
his
head
between
his
hands
went
on
blubbering
softly
and
spoke
no
word
meyrick
had
never
been
an
unobservant
lad
he
had
simply
made
a
discovery
that
evening
that
in
rome
certain
roman
customs
must
be
adopted
the
wise
bates
went
on
doing
his
copy
of
latin
verse
chuckling
gently
to
himself
bates
was
a
cynic
he
despised
all
the
customs
and
manners
of
the
place
most
heartily
and
took
the
most
curious
care
to
observe
them
he
might
have
been
the
inventor
and
patentee
of
rocker
if
one
judged
him
by
the
fervour
with
which
he
played
it
he
entered
his
name
for
every
possible
event
at
the
sports
and
jumped
the
jumps
and
threw
the
hammer
and
ran
the
races
as
if
his
life
depended
on
it
once
horbury
had
accidentally
bates
saying
something
about
the
honour
of
the
house
which
went
to
his
heart
as
for
cricket
bates
played
as
if
his
sole
ambition
was
to
become
a
professional
and
he
chuckled
as
he
did
his
latin
verses
which
he
wrote
to
the
awe
of
other
boys
as
if
he
were
writing
a
letter
that
is
without
making
a
rough
copy
for
bates
had
got
the
hang
of
the
whole
system
from
rocker
to
latin
verse
and
his
copies
were
much
admired
he
grinned
that
evening
partly
at
the
transmutation
of
meyrick
and
partly
at
the
line
he
was
jotting
down
loquor
coelo
resonans
vox
funditur
in
after
life
he
jotted
down
a
couple
of
novels
which
sold
as
the
journalists
said
like
hot
cakes
meyrick
went
to
see
him
soon
after
the
first
novel
had
gone
into
its
thirtieth
thousand
and
bates
was
reading
appreciations
and
fingering
a
cheque
and
chuckling
mira

said

and
the
public
want

the
rest
of
prep
went
off
quite
quietly
pelly
was
slowly
recovering
from
the
shock
that
he
had
received
and
began
to
meditate
revenge
meyrick
had
got
him
unawares
he
reflected
it
was
merely
an
accident
and
he
resolved
to
challenge
meyrick
to
fight
and
give
him
back
the
worst
licking
he
had
ever
had
in
his
life
he
was
beefy
but
a
bold
fellow
rawson
who
was
really
a
cruel
coward
and
a
sneak
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
wanted
no
more
and
from
time
to
time
cast
meek
and
propitiatory
glances
in
meyrick
direction
at
nine
they
all
went
into
their
for
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
at
a
quarter
to
ten
horbury
appeared
in
cap
and
gown
and
read
a
chapter
from
paul
epistle
to
the
romans
with
one
or
two
singularly
maundering
and
unhappy
prayers
he
stopped
the
boys
as
they
were
going
up
to
their
rooms
what
this
pelly
he
said
your
nose
is
all
swollen
it
been
bleeding
too
i
see
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
and
you
rawson
how
do
you
account
for
your
eyes
being
black
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
please
sir
there
was
a
very
stiff
bully
down
at
rocker
this
afternoon
and
rawson
and
i
got
tokered
badly
were
you
in
the
bully
bates
no
sir
i
been
outside
since
the
beginning
of
the
term
but
all
the
fellows
were
playing
up
tremendously
and
i
saw
rawson
and
pelly
had
been
touched
when
we
were
changing
ah
i
see
i
very
glad
to
find
the
house
plays
up
so
well
as
for
you
bates
i
hear
you
the
best
outside
for
your
age
that
we
ever
had
good
night
the
three
said
thank
you
sir
as
if
their
dearest
wish
had
been
gratified
and
the
master
could
have
sworn
that
bates
flushed
with
pleasure
at
his
word
of
praise
but
the
fact
was
that
bates
had
suggested
the
flush
by
a
cunning
arrangement
of
his
features
the
boys
vanished
and
horbury
returned
to
his
desk
he
was
editing
a
selection
called
english
literature
for
lower
forms
he
began
to
read
from
the
slips
that
he
had
prepared
all
day
long
the
noise
of
battle
among
the
mountains
by
the
winter
sea
until
king
arthur
table
man
by
man
had
fallen
in
lyonnesse
he
stopped
and
set
a
figure
by
the
last
word
and
then
on
a
blank
slip
with
a
corresponding
letter
he
repeated
the
figure
and
wrote
the
note
lyonnesse
the
sicilly
isles
then
he
took
a
third
slip
and
wrote
the
question
give
the
ancient
name
of
the
sicilly
isles
these
serious
labours
employed
him
till
twelve
he
put
the
materials
of
his
book
away
as
the
clock
struck
and
solemnly
mixed
himself
his
nightly
glass
of
whisky
and
soda
in
the
daytime
he
never
touched
spirits
and
bit
the
one
cigar
which
he
smoked
in
the
hours
the
stings
of
the
head
sherry
and
of
his
conversation
no
longer
burned
within
him
time
and
work
and
the
bite
of
the
cane
in
meyrick
flesh
had
soothed
his
soul
and
he
set
himself
to
dream
leaning
back
in
his
watching
the
cheerful
fire
he
was
thinking
of
what
he
would
do
when
he
succeeded
to
the
headmastership
already
there
were
rumours
that
chesson
had
refused
the
bishopric
of
dubric
in
order
that
he
might
be
free
to
accept
dorchester
which
in
the
nature
of
things
must
soon
be
vacant
horbury
had
no
doubt
that
the
headmastership
would
be
his
he
had
influential
friends
who
assured
him
that
the
trustees
would
not
hesitate
for
an
instant
then
he
would
show
the
world
what
an
english
public
school
could
be
made
in
five
years
he
calculated
he
would
double
the
numbers
he
saw
the
coming
importance
of
the
modern
side
and
especially
of
science
personally
he
detested
stinks
but
he
knew
what
an
effect
he
would
produce
with
a
great
laboratory
fitted
with
the
very
best
appliances
and
directed
by
a
highly
qualified
master
then
again
an
elaborate
gymnasium
must
be
built
there
must
be
an
engineer
shop
too
and
a
carpenter
as
well
and
people
were
beginning
to
complain
that
a
public
school
education
was
of
no
use
in
the
city
there
must
be
a
business
master
an
expert
from
the
stock
exchange
who
would
see
that
this
reproach
was
removed
then
he
considered
that
a
large
number
of
the
boys
belonged
to
the
class
why
should
a
country
gentleman
be
at
the
mercy
of
his
agent
forced
for
lack
of
technical
knowledge
to
accept
statements
which
he
could
not
check
it
was
clear
that
the
management
of
land
and
great
estates
must
have
its
part
in
the
scheme
and
again
the
of
the
crammers
must
be
bought
on
his
own
terms
so
that
the
boys
who
wished
to
get
into
the
army
or
the
civil
service
would
be
practically
compelled
to
come
to
lupton
already
he
saw
paragraphs
in
the
and
in
all
the
papers
paragraphs
which
mentioned
the
fact
that
per
cent
of
the
successful
candidates
for
the
indian
civil
service
had
received
their
education
at
the
foundation
of
stout
old
martin
rolle
meanwhile
in
all
this
flood
of
novelty
the
old
traditions
should
be
maintained
with
more
vigour
than
ever
the
classics
should
be
taught
as
they
never
had
been
taught
every
one
of
the
masters
on
this
side
should
be
in
the
highest
honours
and
if
possible
he
would
get
famous
men
for
the
work
they
should
not
merely
be
good
but
also
notorious
scholars
gee
the
famous
explorer
in
crete
who
had
made
an
enormous
mark
in
regions
widely
removed
from
the
scholastic
world
by
his
wonderful
book
or
the
secret
of
the
must
come
to
lupton
at
any
price
and
maynard
who
had
discovered
some
most
important
greek
manuscripts
in
egypt
he
must
have
a
form
too
then
there
was
rendell
who
had
done
so
well
with
his
and
davies
author
of
olive
of
a
daring
but
most
brilliant
book
which
promised
to
upset
the
whole
established
theory
of
mythology
he
would
have
such
a
staff
as
no
school
had
ever
dreamed
of
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
about
paying
them
thought
horbury
our
numbers
will
go
up
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
the
fees
shall
be
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
such
terms
will
do
us
more
good
than
anything
he
went
into
minute
detail
he
must
take
expert
advice
as
to
the
advisability
of
the
school
farming
on
its
own
account
and
so
supplying
the
boys
with
meat
milk
bread
butter
and
vegetables
at
first
cost
he
believed
it
could
be
done
he
would
get
a
scotch
farmer
from
the
lowlands
and
make
him
superintendent
at
a
handsome
salary
and
with
a
share
in
the
profits
there
would
be
the
splendid
advertisement
of
the
whole
dietary
of
the
school
supplied
from
the
school
farms
under
the
supervision
of
david
anderson
formerly
of
haddanneuk
the
largest
tenancy
in
the
duke
of
ayr
estates
the
food
would
be
better
and
cheaper
too
but
there
would
be
no
luxury
the
spartan
card
was
always
worth
playing
one
must
strike
the
note
of
plain
living
in
a
luxurious
age
there
must
be
no
losing
of
the
old
public
school
severity
on
the
other
hand
the
boy
hands
should
be
free
to
go
into
their
own
pockets
there
should
be
no
restraint
here
if
a
boy
chose
to
bring
in
aux
or
de
mouton
√†
la
ste
to
help
out
his
tea
that
was
his
why
should
not
the
school
grant
a
concession
to
some
big
london
firm
who
would
pay
handsomely
for
the
privilege
of
supplying
the
hungry
lads
with
every
kind
of
expensive
dainty
the
sum
could
be
justly
made
a
large
one
as
any
competing
shop
could
be
promptly
put
out
of
bounds
with
reason
or
without
it
on
one
side
at
the
other
counter
enormous
prices
could
be
charged
to
the
wealthy
boys
of
whom
the
school
would
be
composed
yet
on
the
other
hand
the
distinguished
visitor
judge
bishop
peer
or
what
not
would
lunch
at
the
headmaster
house
and
eat
the
boys
dinner
and
go
away
saying
it
was
quite
the
plainest
and
very
many
times
the
best
meal
he
had
ever
tasted
there
would
be
saddle
of
mutton
roasted
and
not
baked
floury
potatoes
and
cauliflower
apple
pudding
with
real
english
cheese
with
an
excellent
glass
of
the
school
beer
an
honest
and
delicious
beverage
made
of
malt
and
hops
in
the
school
brewery
horbury
knew
enough
of
modern
eating
and
drinking
to
understand
that
such
a
meal
would
be
a
choice
rarity
to
nine
rich
people
out
of
ten
and
yet
it
was
spartan
utterly
devoid
of
luxury
and
ostentation
again
he
passed
from
detail
and
minuti√¶
into
great
napoleonic
regions
a
thousand
boys
at
a
year
that
would
be
an
income
for
the
school
of
five
hundred
thousand
pounds
the
profits
would
be
gigantic
immense
after
paying
large
even
extravagant
prices
to
the
staff
after
all
building
expenses
had
been
deducted
he
hardly
dared
to
think
how
vast
a
sum
would
accrue
year
by
year
to
the
trustees
the
vision
began
to
assume
such
magnificence
that
it
became
oppressive
it
put
on
the
splendours
and
delights
of
the
hashish
dream
which
are
too
great
and
too
piercing
for
mortal
hearts
to
bear
and
yet
it
was
no
mirage
there
was
not
a
step
that
could
not
be
demonstrated
shown
to
be
based
on
hard
business
considerations
he
tried
to
keep
back
his
growing
excitement
to
argue
with
himself
that
he
was
dealing
in
visions
but
the
facts
were
too
obstinate
he
saw
that
it
would
be
his
part
to
work
the
same
miracle
in
the
scholastic
world
as
the
great
american
storekeepers
had
operated
in
the
world
of
retail
trade
the
principle
was
precisely
the
same
instead
of
a
hundred
small
shops
making
comparatively
modest
and
humdrum
profits
you
had
the
vast
emporium
doing
business
on
the
gigantic
scale
with
vastly
diminished
expenses
and
vastly
increased
rewards
here
again
was
a
hint
he
had
thought
of
america
and
he
knew
that
here
was
an
inexhaustible
gold
mine
that
no
other
scholastic
prospector
had
even
dreamed
of
the
rich
american
was
notoriously
hungry
for
everything
that
was
english
from
to
pedigrees
he
had
never
thought
of
sending
his
son
to
an
english
public
school
because
he
considered
the
system
hopelessly
behind
the
times
but
the
new
translated
lupton
would
be
to
other
public
schools
as
a
new
york
hotel
of
the
latest
fashion
is
to
a
village
and
yet
the
young
millionaire
would
grow
up
in
the
company
of
the
sons
of
the
english
gentlemen
imbibing
the
unique
culture
of
english
life
while
at
the
same
time
he
enjoyed
all
the
advantages
of
modern
ideas
modern
science
and
modern
business
training
land
was
still
comparatively
cheap
at
lupton
the
school
must
buy
it
quietly
indirectly
by
degrees
and
then
pile
after
pile
of
vast
buildings
rose
before
his
eyes
he
saw
the
sons
of
the
rich
drawn
from
all
the
ends
of
the
world
to
the
great
school
there
to
learn
the
secret
of
the
chesson
was
mistaken
in
that
idea
of
his
which
he
thought
daring
and
original
of
establishing
a
distinct
jewish
house
where
the
food
should
be
kosher
the
rich
jew
who
desired
to
send
his
son
to
an
english
public
school
was
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
anxious
to
do
so
precisely
because
he
wanted
to
sink
his
son
connection
with
jewry
in
oblivion
he
had
heard
chesson
talk
of
our
christian
duty
to
the
seed
of
israel
in
this
connection
the
man
was
clearly
a
fool
no
the
more
jews
the
better
but
no
jewish
house
and
no
puseyism
either
broad
earnest
religious
teaching
with
a
leaning
to
moderate
anglicanism
should
be
the
faith
of
lupton
as
to
this
chesson
was
certainly
sound
enough
he
had
always
made
a
firm
stand
against
ecclesiasticism
in
any
form
horbury
knew
the
average
english
parent
of
the
wealthier
classes
thoroughly
he
knew
that
though
he
generally
called
himself
a
churchman
he
was
quite
content
to
have
his
sons
prepared
for
confirmation
by
a
confessed
agnostic
certainly
this
liberty
must
not
be
narrowed
when
lupton
became
cosmopolitan
we
will
retain
all
the
dignified
associations
which
belong
to
the
established
church
he
said
to
himself
and
at
the
same
time
we
shall
be
utterly
free
from
the
taint
of
dogmatic
teaching
he
had
a
sudden
brilliant
idea
everybody
in
church
circles
was
saying
that
the
english
bishops
were
terribly
overworked
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
most
strenuous
men
with
the
best
intentions
to
supervise
effectually
the
huge
dioceses
that
had
descended
from
the
sparsely
populated
england
of
the
middle
ages
everywhere
there
was
a
demand
for
suffragans
and
more
suffragans
in
the
last
week
there
were
three
letters
on
the
subject
one
from
a
clergyman
in
their
own
diocese
the
bishop
had
been
attacked
by
some
rabid
ritualistic
person
who
had
pointed
out
that
nine
out
of
every
ten
parishes
had
not
so
much
as
seen
the
colour
of
his
hood
ever
since
his
appointment
ten
years
before
the
archdeacon
of
melby
had
replied
in
a
capital
letter
scathing
and
yet
humorous
horbury
turned
to
the
paper
on
the
table
beside
his
chair
and
looked
up
the
letter
in
the
first
place
wrote
the
archdeacon
your
correspondent
does
not
seem
to
have
realised
that
the
of
the
diocese
of
melby
is
not
identical
with
that
of
sacerdotalism
the
sturdy
folk
of
the
midlands
have
not
yet
i
am
thankful
to
say
forgotten
the
lessons
of
our
great
reformation
they
have
no
wish
to
see
a
revival
of
the
purely
mechanical
religion
of
the
middle
ages
of
the
system
of
a
sacrificing
priesthood
and
of
sacraments
efficacious
opere
hence
they
do
not
regard
the
episcopate
quite
in
the
same
light
as
your
correspondent
who
it
seems
to
me
looks
upon
a
bishop
as
a
sort
of
christianised
endowed
with
certain
mysterious
thaumaturgic
powers
which
have
descended
to
him
by
an
imaginary
spiritual
succession
this
was
not
the
view
of
hooker
nor
i
venture
to
say
has
it
ever
been
the
view
of
the
really
representative
divines
of
the
established
church
of
england
still
the
archdeacon
went
on
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
present
diocese
of
melby
is
unwieldy
and
it
may
be
fairly
said
unworkable
then
there
followed
the
humorous
anecdote
of
sir
boyle
roche
and
the
bird
and
finally
the
archdeacon
emitted
the
prayer
that
god
in
his
own
good
time
would
put
it
into
the
hearts
of
our
rulers
in
church
and
state
to
give
their
good
bishop
an
episcopal
curate
horbury
got
up
from
his
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
the
study
his
excitement
was
so
great
that
he
could
keep
quiet
no
longer
his
cigar
had
gone
out
long
ago
and
he
had
barely
sipped
the
whisky
and
soda
his
eyes
glittered
with
excitement
circumstances
seemed
positively
to
be
playing
into
his
hands
the
dice
of
the
world
were
being
loaded
in
his
favour
he
was
like
bel
ami
at
his
wedding
he
almost
began
to
believe
in
providence
for
he
was
sure
it
could
be
managed
here
was
a
general
feeling
that
no
one
man
could
do
the
work
of
the
diocese
there
must
be
a
suffragan
and
lupton
must
give
the
new
bishop
his
title
no
other
town
was
possible
dunham
had
certainly
been
a
see
in
the
eighth
century
but
it
was
now
little
more
than
a
village
and
a
village
served
by
a
miserable
little
branch
line
whereas
lupton
was
on
the
great
main
track
of
the
midland
system
with
easy
connections
to
every
part
of
the
country
the
archdeacon
who
was
also
a
peer
would
undoubtedly
become
the
first
bishop
of
lupton
and
he
should
be
the
titular
chaplain
of
the
great
school
chaplain
the
right
reverend
lord
selwyn
lord
bishop
of
lupton
horbury
gasped
it
was
too
magnificent
too
splendid
he
knew
lord
selwyn
quite
well
and
had
no
doubt
as
to
his
acceptance
he
was
a
poor
man
and
there
would
be
no
difficulty
whatever
in
establishing
a
the
archdeacon
was
just
the
man
for
the
place
he
was
no
pedantic
theologian
but
a
broad
man
of
the
world
horbury
remembered
almost
with
ecstasy
that
he
had
lectured
all
over
the
united
states
with
immense
success
the
american
press
had
been
enthusiastic
and
the
first
congregational
church
of
chicago
had
implored
selwyn
to
accept
its
call
preach
what
he
liked
and
pocket
an
honorarium
of
thousand
dollars
a
year
and
on
the
other
hand
what
could
the
most
orthodox
desire
safer
than
a
chaplain
who
was
not
only
a
bishop
but
a
peer
of
the
realm
wonderful
here
were
the
three
birds
liberalism
orthodoxy
and
reverence
for
the
house
of
lords
caught
safe
and
secure
in
this
one
net
the
games
they
should
be
maintained
in
all
their
glory
rather
on
an
infinitely
more
splendid
scale
cricket
and
sticker
the
lupton
hockey
rackets
and
fives
should
be
all
encouraged
and
more
lupton
should
be
the
only
school
to
possess
a
tennis
court
the
noble
de
the
game
of
kings
the
most
aristocratic
of
all
sports
should
have
a
worthy
home
at
lupton
they
would
train
champions
they
would
have
both
french
and
english
markers
skilled
in
the
latest
developments
of
the
de
service
better
than
half
a
yard
i
think
said
horbury
to
himself
they
will
have
to
do
their
best
to
beat
that
but
he
placed
most
reliance
on
rocker
this
was
the
lupton
football
a
variant
as
distinctive
in
its
way
as
the
eton
wall
game
people
have
thought
that
the
name
is
a
sort
of
portmanteau
word
a
combination
of
rugger
and
soccer
but
in
reality
the
title
was
derived
from
the
field
where
the
game
used
to
be
played
in
old
days
by
the
townsfolk
as
in
many
other
places
football
at
lupton
had
been
originally
an
excuse
for
a
between
two
parishes
in
the
town
michael
and
every
year
on
shrove
tuesday
the
townsfolk
young
and
old
had
proceeded
to
the
town
field
and
had
fought
out
their
differences
with
considerable
violence
the
field
was
broken
land
a
deep
sluggish
stream
crossed
one
angle
of
it
and
in
the
middle
there
were
quarries
and
jagged
limestone
rocks
hence
football
was
called
in
the
town
playing
rocks
for
indeed
it
was
considered
an
excellent
point
of
play
to
hurl
a
man
over
the
edge
of
the
quarry
on
to
the
rocks
beneath
and
so
late
as
a
certain
jonas
simpson
of
had
had
his
spine
broken
in
this
way
however
as
a
boy
from
was
drowned
in
the
wand
the
same
day
the
game
was
always
reckoned
a
draw
it
was
from
the
peculiarities
of
this
old
english
sport
that
the
school
had
constructed
its
game
the
town
field
had
of
course
long
been
stolen
from
the
townsfolk
and
built
over
but
the
boys
had
curiously
enough
perpetuated
the
tradition
of
its
peculiarities
in
a
kind
of
football
ritual
for
besides
the
two
goals
one
part
of
the
field
was
marked
by
a
line
of
low
white
posts
these
indicated
the
course
of
a
wand
brook
and
in
the
line
of
these
posts
it
was
lawful
to
catch
an
opponent
by
the
throat
and
choke
him
till
he
turned
black
in
the
face
the
best
substitute
for
drowning
that
the
revisers
of
the
game
could
imagine
again
about
the
centre
of
the
field
two
taller
posts
indicated
the
position
of
the
quarries
and
between
these
you
might
be
hit
or
kicked
full
in
the
stomach
without
the
smallest
ground
of
complaint
the
stroke
being
a
milder
version
of
the
old
fall
on
the
rocks
there
were
many
other
like
amenities
in
rocker
and
horbury
maintained
it
was
by
far
the
manliest
variant
of
the
game
for
this
pleasing
sport
he
now
designed
a
fame
rocker
should
be
played
wherever
the
english
flag
floated
east
and
west
north
and
south
from
hong
kong
to
british
columbia
in
canada
and
new
zealand
there
should
be
the
of
this
great
rite
and
the
traveller
seeing
the
mystic
enclosure
the
two
goals
the
line
of
little
posts
marking
brooks
and
the
two
poles
indicating
quarries
should
know
english
soil
as
surely
as
by
the
union
jack
the
technical
terms
of
rocker
should
become
a
part
of
the
great
inheritance
the
whole
world
should
hear
of
and
tokering
of
outsides
and
rammers
it
would
require
working
but
it
was
to
be
done
articles
in
the
magazines
and
in
the
press
perhaps
a
story
of
school
life
a
new
must
be
written
the
midlands
and
the
north
must
be
shown
that
there
was
money
in
it
and
the
rest
would
be
easy
one
thing
troubled
horbury
his
mind
was
full
of
the
new
and
splendid
buildings
that
were
to
be
erected
but
he
was
aware
that
antiquity
still
counted
for
something
and
unfortunately
lupton
could
show
very
little
that
was
really
antique
forty
years
before
stanley
the
first
reforming
headmaster
had
pulled
down
the
old
high
school
there
were
prints
of
it
it
was
a
building
with
a
wavering
and
an
overhanging
upper
story
there
were
dim
leaded
windows
and
a
grey
arched
porch
an
ugly
old
barn
stanley
called
it
scott
was
called
in
and
built
the
present
high
school
a
splendid
hall
in
red
brick
french
with
venetian
detail
it
was
much
admired
but
horbury
was
sorry
that
the
old
school
had
been
destroyed
he
saw
for
the
first
time
that
it
might
have
been
made
a
valuable
attraction
then
again
dowsing
who
succeeded
stanley
had
knocked
the
cloisters
all
to
bits
there
was
only
one
side
of
the
quadrangle
left
and
this
had
been
boarded
up
and
used
as
a
shed
horbury
did
not
know
what
to
say
of
the
destruction
of
the
cross
that
used
to
stand
in
the
centre
of
the
quad
no
doubt
dowsing
was
right
in
thinking
it
superstitious
still
it
might
have
been
left
as
a
curiosity
and
shown
to
visitors
just
as
the
instruments
of
bygone
cruelty
the
rack
and
the
iron
maid
are
preserved
and
exhibited
to
wondering
sightseers
there
was
no
real
danger
of
any
superstitious
adoration
of
the
cross
it
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
harmless
as
the
axe
and
block
at
the
tower
of
london
dowsing
had
ruined
what
might
have
been
an
important
asset
in
the
exploitation
of
the
school
still
perhaps
the
loss
was
not
altogether
irreparable
high
school
was
gone
and
could
not
be
recovered
but
the
cloisters
might
be
restored
and
the
cross
too
horbury
knew
that
the
monument
in
front
of
charing
cross
railway
station
was
considered
by
many
to
be
a
genuine
antique
why
not
get
a
good
man
to
build
them
a
cross
not
like
the
old
one
of
course
that
fair
roode
with
our
deare
ladie
saint
marie
and
saint
john
and
below
the
stories
of
the
blissful
saints
and
angels
that
would
never
do
but
a
vague
gothic
erection
with
plenty
of
kings
and
queens
imaginary
benefactors
of
the
school
and
a
small
cross
at
the
top
that
could
give
no
offence
to
anybody
and
might
pass
with
nine
people
out
of
ten
as
a
genuine
remnant
of
the
middle
ages
it
could
be
made
of
soft
stone
and
allowed
to
weather
for
a
few
years
then
a
coat
of
invisible
fluid
would
preserve
carvings
and
imagery
that
would
already
appear
venerable
in
decay
there
was
no
need
to
make
any
precise
statements
parents
and
the
public
might
be
allowed
to
draw
their
own
conclusions
horbury
was
neglecting
nothing
he
was
building
up
a
great
scheme
in
his
mind
and
to
him
it
seemed
that
every
detail
was
worth
attending
to
while
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
whole
effect
he
believed
in
finish
there
must
be
no
rough
edges
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
school
legend
must
be
invented
the
real
history
was
not
quite
what
he
wanted
though
it
might
work
in
with
a
more
decorative
account
of
lupton
origins
one
might
use
the
of
martin
foundation
the
bequest
of
land
to
build
and
maintain
a
school
where
a
hundred
boys
should
be
taught
grammar
and
ten
poor
scholars
and
six
priests
should
pray
for
the
founder
soul
this
was
well
enough
but
one
might
hint
that
martin
rolle
really
refounded
and
a
school
of
saxon
origin
probably
established
by
king
alfred
himself
in
luppa
tun
then
again
who
could
show
that
shakespeare
had
not
visited
lupton
his
famous
schoolboy
creeping
like
snail
unwillingly
to
school
might
very
possibly
have
been
observed
by
the
poet
as
he
strolled
by
the
banks
of
the
wand
many
famous
men
might
have
received
their
education
at
lupton
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
make
a
plausible
list
of
such
it
must
be
done
carefully
and
cautiously
with
such
phrases
as
it
has
always
been
a
tradition
at
lupton
that
sir
walter
raleigh
received
part
of
his
education
at
the
school
or
again
an
earlier
generation
of
luptonians
remembered
the
initials
on
a
cut
deeply
in
the
mantel
of
old
high
school
now
unfortunately
demolished
antiquarians
would
laugh
possibly
but
who
cared
about
antiquarians
for
the
average
man
charing
was
derived
from
and
he
loved
to
have
it
so
and
horbury
intended
to
appeal
to
the
average
man
though
he
was
a
schoolmaster
he
was
no
recluse
and
he
had
marked
the
ways
of
the
world
from
his
quiet
study
in
lupton
hence
he
understood
the
immense
value
of
a
grain
of
quackery
in
all
schemes
which
are
meant
to
appeal
to
mortals
it
was
a
deadly
mistake
to
suppose
that
anything
which
was
all
quackery
would
be
a
success
a
permanent
success
at
all
events
it
was
a
deadlier
mistake
still
to
suppose
that
anything
quite
devoid
of
quackery
could
pay
handsomely
the
average
english
palate
would
shudder
at
the
flavour
of
but
it
would
be
charmed
by
the
insertion
of
that
point
which
turned
mere
goodness
into
triumph
and
laurelled
perfection
and
there
was
no
need
to
mention
the
word
garlic
before
the
guests
lupton
was
not
going
to
be
all
garlic
it
was
to
be
infinitely
the
best
scholastic
dish
that
had
ever
been
served
the
ingredients
should
be
unsurpassed
and
unsurpassable
but
king
alfred
foundation
of
a
school
at
tun
and
that
on
a
cut
deeply
on
the
mantel
of
the
vanished
high
school
these
and
legends
like
unto
them
these
would
be
the
last
touch
petit
point
it
was
a
great
scheme
wonderful
and
glorious
and
the
most
amazing
thing
about
it
was
that
it
was
certain
to
be
realised
there
was
not
a
flaw
from
start
to
finish
the
trustees
were
certain
to
appoint
him
he
had
that
from
a
sure
quarter
and
it
was
but
a
question
of
a
year
or
two
perhaps
only
of
a
month
or
two
before
all
this
great
and
golden
vision
should
be
converted
into
hard
and
tangible
fact
he
drank
off
his
glass
of
whisky
and
soda
it
had
become
flat
and
brackish
but
to
him
it
was
nectar
since
it
was
flavoured
with
ecstasy
he
frowned
suddenly
as
he
went
upstairs
to
his
room
an
unpleasant
recollection
had
intruded
for
a
moment
on
his
amazing
fantasy
but
he
dismissed
the
thought
as
soon
as
it
arose
that
was
all
over
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
trouble
from
that
direction
and
so
his
mind
filled
with
images
he
fell
asleep
and
saw
lupton
as
the
centre
of
the
whole
world
like
jerusalem
in
the
ancient
maps
a
student
of
the
deep
things
of
mysticism
has
detected
a
curious
element
of
comedy
in
the
management
of
human
concerns
and
there
certainly
seems
a
touch
of
humour
in
the
fact
that
on
this
very
night
while
horbury
was
building
the
splendid
lupton
of
the
future
the
palace
of
his
thought
and
his
life
was
shattered
for
ever
into
bitter
dust
and
nothingness
but
so
it
was
the
dread
arrest
had
been
solemnly
recognised
and
that
wretched
canonry
at
wareham
was
irrevocably
pronounced
for
doom
fantastic
were
the
elements
of
forces
that
had
gone
to
the
ordering
of
this
great
sentence
raw
corn
spirit
in
the
guise
of
sherry
the
impertinence
or
what
seemed
such
of
an
elderly
clergyman
a
boiled
leg
of
mutton
a
troublesome
and
disobedient
boy
and
another
person
ii
i
he
was
standing
in
a
wild
bare
country
something
about
it
seemed
vaguely
familiar
the
land
rose
and
fell
in
dull
and
weary
undulations
in
a
vast
circle
of
dun
ploughland
and
grey
meadow
bounded
by
a
dim
horizon
without
promise
or
hope
dreary
as
a
prison
wall
the
infinite
melancholy
of
an
autumn
evening
brooded
heavily
over
all
the
world
and
the
sky
was
hidden
by
livid
clouds
it
all
brought
back
to
him
some
memory
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
gazed
on
that
sad
plain
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
deep
and
heavy
silence
over
all
a
silence
unbroken
by
so
much
as
the
fluttering
of
a
leaf
the
trees
seemed
of
a
strange
shape
and
strange
were
the
stunted
thorns
dotted
about
the
broken
field
in
which
he
stood
a
little
path
at
his
feet
bordered
by
the
thorn
bushes
wandered
away
to
the
left
into
the
dim
twilight
it
had
about
it
some
indefinable
air
of
mystery
as
if
it
must
lead
one
down
into
a
mystic
region
where
all
earthly
things
are
forgotten
and
lost
for
ever
he
sat
down
beneath
the
bare
twisted
boughs
of
a
great
tree
and
watched
the
dreary
land
grow
darker
and
yet
darker
he
wondered
where
he
was
and
how
he
had
come
to
that
place
remembering
faintly
tales
of
like
adventure
a
man
passed
by
a
familiar
wall
one
day
and
opening
a
door
before
unnoticed
found
himself
in
a
new
world
of
unsurmised
and
marvellous
experiences
another
man
shot
an
arrow
farther
than
any
of
his
friends
and
became
the
husband
of
the
fairy
yet
this
was
not
fairyland
these
were
rather
the
sad
fields
and
unhappy
graves
of
the
underworld
than
the
abode
of
endless
pleasures
and
undying
delights
and
yet
in
all
that
he
saw
there
was
the
promise
of
great
wonder
only
one
thing
was
clear
to
him
he
knew
that
he
was
ambrose
that
he
had
been
driven
from
great
and
unspeakable
joys
into
miserable
exile
and
banishment
he
had
come
from
a
far
far
place
by
a
hidden
way
and
darkness
had
closed
about
him
and
bitter
drink
and
deadly
meat
were
given
him
and
all
gladness
was
hidden
from
him
this
was
all
he
could
remember
and
now
he
was
astray
he
knew
not
how
or
why
in
this
wild
sad
land
and
the
night
descended
dark
upon
him
suddenly
there
was
as
it
were
a
cry
far
away
in
the
shadowy
silence
and
the
thorn
bushes
began
to
rustle
before
a
shrilling
wind
that
rose
as
the
night
came
down
at
this
summons
the
heavy
clouds
broke
up
and
dispersed
fleeting
across
the
sky
and
the
pure
heaven
appeared
with
the
last
rose
flush
of
the
sunset
dying
from
it
and
there
shone
the
silver
light
of
the
evening
star
ambrose
heart
was
drawn
up
to
this
light
as
he
gazed
he
saw
that
the
star
grew
greater
and
greater
it
advanced
towards
him
through
the
air
its
beams
pierced
to
his
soul
as
if
they
were
the
sound
of
a
silver
trumpet
an
ocean
of
white
splendour
flowed
over
him
he
dwelt
within
the
star
it
was
but
for
a
moment
he
was
still
sitting
beneath
the
tree
of
the
twisted
branches
but
the
sky
was
now
clear
and
filled
with
a
great
peace
the
wind
had
fallen
and
a
more
happy
light
shone
on
the
great
plain
ambrose
was
thirsty
and
then
he
saw
that
beside
the
tree
there
was
a
well
half
hidden
by
the
arching
roots
that
rose
above
it
the
water
was
still
and
shining
as
though
it
were
a
mirror
of
black
marble
and
marking
the
brim
was
a
great
stone
on
which
were
cut
the
letters
fons
vitae
immortalis
he
rose
and
bending
over
the
well
put
down
his
lips
to
drink
and
his
soul
and
body
were
filled
as
with
a
flood
of
joy
now
he
knew
that
all
his
days
of
exile
he
had
borne
with
pain
and
grief
a
heavy
weary
body
there
had
been
dolours
in
every
limb
and
achings
in
every
bone
his
feet
had
dragged
upon
the
ground
slowly
wearily
as
the
feet
of
those
who
go
in
chains
but
dim
broken
spectres
miserable
shapes
and
crooked
images
of
the
world
had
his
eyes
seen
for
they
were
eyes
bleared
with
sickness
darkened
by
the
approach
of
death
now
indeed
he
clearly
beheld
the
shining
vision
of
things
immortal
he
drank
great
draughts
of
the
dark
glittering
water
drinking
it
seemed
the
light
of
the
reflected
stars
and
he
was
filled
with
life
every
sinew
every
muscle
every
particle
of
the
deadly
flesh
shuddered
and
quickened
in
the
communion
of
that
the
nerves
and
veins
rejoiced
together
all
his
being
leapt
with
gladness
and
as
one
finger
touched
another
as
he
still
bent
over
the
well
a
spasm
of
exquisite
pleasure
quivered
and
thrilled
through
his
body
his
heart
throbbed
with
bliss
that
was
unendurable
sense
and
intellect
and
soul
and
spirit
were
as
it
were
sublimed
into
one
white
flame
of
delight
and
all
the
while
it
was
known
to
him
that
these
were
but
the
least
of
the
least
of
the
pleasures
of
the
kingdom
but
the
overrunnings
and
base
tricklings
of
the
great
supernal
cup
he
saw
without
amazement
that
though
the
sun
had
set
the
sky
now
began
to
flush
and
redden
as
if
with
the
northern
light
it
was
no
longer
the
evening
no
longer
the
time
of
the
procession
of
the
dusky
night
the
darkness
doubtless
had
passed
away
in
mortal
hours
while
for
an
infinite
moment
he
tasted
immortal
drink
and
perhaps
one
drop
of
that
water
was
endless
life
but
now
it
was
the
preparation
for
the
day
he
heard
the
words
venit
dies
tua
in
qua
reflorent
they
were
uttered
within
his
heart
and
he
saw
that
all
was
being
made
ready
for
a
great
festival
over
everything
there
was
a
hush
of
expectation
and
as
he
gazed
he
knew
that
he
was
no
longer
in
that
weary
land
of
dun
ploughland
and
grey
meadow
of
the
wild
bare
trees
and
strange
stunted
thorn
bushes
he
was
on
a
hillside
lying
on
the
verge
of
a
great
wood
beneath
in
the
valley
a
brook
sang
faintly
under
the
leaves
of
the
silvery
willows
and
beyond
far
in
the
east
a
vast
wall
of
rounded
mountain
rose
serene
towards
the
sky
all
about
him
was
the
green
world
of
the
leaves
odours
of
the
summer
night
deep
in
the
mystic
heart
of
the
wood
odours
of
many
flowers
and
the
cool
breath
rising
from
the
singing
stream
mingled
in
his
nostrils
the
world
whitened
to
the
dawn
and
then
as
the
light
grew
clear
the
rose
clouds
blossomed
in
the
sky
and
answering
the
earth
seemed
to
glitter
with
sparks
and
glints
of
flame
all
the
east
became
as
a
garden
of
roses
red
flowers
of
living
light
shone
over
the
mountain
and
as
the
beams
of
the
sun
lit
up
the
circle
of
the
earth
a
bird
song
began
from
a
tree
within
the
wood
then
were
heard
the
modulations
of
a
final
and
exultant
ecstasy
the
chant
of
liberation
a
magistral
there
was
the
melody
of
rejoicing
trills
of
unwearied
glad
reiterations
of
choirs
ever
aspiring
prophesying
the
coming
of
the
great
feast
singing
the
eternal
antiphon
as
the
song
aspired
into
the
heights
so
there
aspired
suddenly
before
him
the
walls
and
pinnacles
of
a
great
church
set
upon
a
high
hill
it
was
far
off
and
yet
as
though
it
were
close
at
hand
he
saw
all
the
delicate
and
wonderful
imagery
cut
in
its
stones
the
great
door
in
the
west
was
a
miracle
every
flower
and
leaf
every
reed
and
fern
were
clustered
in
the
work
of
the
capitals
and
in
the
round
arch
above
moulding
within
moulding
showed
all
the
beasts
that
god
has
made
he
saw
the
a
maze
of
fretted
tracery
the
high
lancets
of
the
fair
hall
the
marvellous
buttresses
set
like
angels
about
this
holy
house
whose
pinnacles
were
as
a
place
of
many
springing
trees
and
high
above
the
vast
vault
of
the
roof
rose
up
the
spire
golden
in
the
light
the
bells
were
ringing
for
the
feast
he
heard
from
within
the
walls
the
roll
and
swell
and
triumph
of
the
organ
pius
o
bonus
o
placidus
sonus
hymnus
he
knew
not
how
he
had
taken
his
place
in
this
great
procession
how
surrounded
by
ministrants
in
white
he
too
bore
his
part
in
endless
litanies
he
knew
not
through
what
strange
land
they
passed
in
their
fervent
admirable
order
following
their
banners
and
their
symbols
that
glanced
on
high
before
them
but
that
land
stood
ever
it
seemed
in
a
clear
still
air
crowned
with
golden
sunlight
and
so
there
were
those
who
bore
great
torches
of
wax
strangely
and
beautifully
adorned
with
golden
and
vermilion
ornaments
the
delicate
flame
of
these
tapers
burned
steadily
in
the
still
sunlight
and
the
glittering
silver
censers
as
they
rose
and
fell
tossed
a
pale
cloud
into
the
air
they
delayed
now
and
again
by
wayside
shrines
giving
thanks
for
unutterable
compassions
and
advancing
anew
the
blessed
company
surged
onward
moving
to
its
unknown
goal
in
the
far
blue
mountains
that
rose
beyond
the
plain
there
were
faces
and
shapes
of
awful
beauty
about
him
he
saw
those
in
whose
eyes
were
the
undying
lamps
of
heaven
about
whose
heads
the
golden
hair
was
as
an
aureole
and
there
were
they
that
above
the
girded
vesture
of
white
wore
dyed
garments
and
as
they
advanced
around
their
feet
there
was
the
likeness
of
dim
flames
the
great
white
array
had
vanished
and
he
was
alone
he
was
tracking
a
secret
path
that
wound
in
and
out
through
the
thickets
of
a
great
forest
by
solitary
pools
of
still
water
by
great
oaks
worlds
of
green
leaves
by
fountains
and
streams
of
water
by
the
bubbling
mossy
sources
of
the
brooks
he
followed
this
hidden
way
now
climbing
and
now
descending
but
still
mounting
upward
still
passing
as
he
knew
farther
and
farther
from
all
the
habitations
of
men
through
the
green
boughs
now
he
saw
the
shining
he
saw
the
land
of
the
old
saints
all
the
divisions
of
the
land
that
men
had
given
to
them
for
god
he
saw
their
churches
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
hear
very
faintly
the
noise
of
the
ringing
of
their
holy
bells
then
at
last
when
he
had
crossed
the
old
road
and
had
gone
by
the
land
and
the
fisherman
well
he
found
between
the
forest
and
the
mountain
a
very
ancient
and
little
chapel
and
now
he
heard
the
bell
of
the
saint
ringing
clearly
and
so
sweetly
that
it
was
as
it
were
the
singing
of
the
angels
within
it
was
very
dark
and
there
was
silence
he
knelt
and
saw
scarcely
that
the
chapel
was
divided
into
two
parts
by
a
screen
that
rose
up
to
the
round
roof
there
was
a
glinting
of
shapes
as
if
golden
figures
were
painted
on
this
screen
and
through
the
joinings
of
its
beams
there
streamed
out
thin
needles
of
white
splendour
as
if
within
there
was
a
light
greater
than
that
of
the
sun
at
noonday
and
the
flesh
began
to
tremble
for
all
the
place
was
filled
with
the
odours
of
paradise
and
he
heard
the
ringing
of
the
holy
bell
and
the
voices
of
the
choir
that
the
fairy
birds
of
rhiannon
crying
and
proclaiming
and
praise
to
the
conqueror
of
death
to
the
fountain
of
life
nine
times
they
sang
this
anthem
and
then
the
whole
place
was
filled
with
blinding
light
for
a
door
in
the
screen
had
been
opened
and
there
came
forth
an
old
man
all
in
shining
white
on
whose
head
was
a
gold
crown
before
him
went
one
who
rang
the
bell
on
each
side
there
were
young
men
with
torches
and
in
his
hands
he
bore
the
of
wrapped
about
in
veils
of
gold
and
of
all
colours
so
that
it
might
not
be
discerned
and
so
he
passed
before
the
screen
and
the
light
of
heaven
burst
forth
from
that
which
he
held
then
he
entered
in
again
by
a
door
that
was
on
the
other
side
and
the
holy
things
were
hidden
and
ambrose
heard
from
within
an
awful
voice
and
the
words
and
great
sorrow
are
on
him
for
he
hath
looked
unworthily
into
the
tremendous
mysteries
and
on
the
secret
glory
which
is
hidden
from
the
holy
ii
poetry
is
the
only
possible
way
of
saying
anything
that
is
worth
saying
at
all
this
was
an
axiom
that
in
later
years
ambrose
friends
were
forced
to
hear
at
frequent
intervals
he
would
go
on
to
say
that
he
used
the
term
poetry
in
its
most
liberal
sense
including
in
it
all
mystic
or
symbolic
prose
all
painting
and
statuary
that
was
worthy
to
be
called
art
all
great
architecture
and
all
true
music
he
meant
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
mysteries
can
only
be
conveyed
by
symbols
unfortunately
however
he
did
not
always
make
it
quite
clear
that
this
was
the
proposition
that
he
intended
to
utter
and
thus
offence
was
sometimes
given
as
for
example
to
the
scientific
gentleman
who
had
been
brought
to
meyrick
rooms
and
went
away
early
wondering
audibly
and
sarcastically
whether
your
clever
friend
wanted
to
metrify
biology
and
set
euclid
to
bach
organ
fugues
however
the
great
axiom
as
he
called
it
was
the
justification
that
he
put
forward
in
defence
of
the
notes
on
which
the
previous
section
is
based
of
course
he
would
say
the
symbolism
is
inadequate
but
that
is
the
defect
of
speech
of
any
kind
when
you
have
once
ventured
beyond
the
multiplication
table
and
the
jargon
of
the
stock
exchange
inadequacy
of
expression
is
merely
a
minor
part
of
the
great
tragedy
of
humanity
only
an
ass
thinks
that
he
has
succeeded
in
uttering
the
perfect
content
of
his
thought
without
either
excess
or
defect
then
again
he
might
go
on
the
symbolism
would
very
likely
be
misleading
to
a
great
many
people
but
what
is
one
to
do
i
believe
many
good
people
find
turner
mad
and
dickens
tiresome
and
if
the
great
sometimes
fail
what
hope
is
there
for
the
little
we
can
not
all
be
well
popular
novelists
of
the
day
of
course
the
notes
in
question
were
made
many
years
after
the
event
they
commemorate
they
were
the
man
translation
of
all
the
wonderful
and
inexpressible
emotions
of
the
boy
and
as
meyrick
puts
it
many
words
or
symbols
are
used
in
them
which
were
unknown
to
the
lad
of
fifteen
nevertheless
he
said
they
are
the
best
words
that
i
can
find
as
has
been
said
the
old
grange
was
a
large
roomy
house
a
space
could
easily
have
been
found
for
half
a
dozen
more
boys
if
the
high
usher
had
cared
to
be
bothered
with
them
as
it
was
it
was
a
favour
to
be
at
horbury
and
there
was
usually
some
personal
reason
for
admission
pelly
for
example
was
the
son
of
an
old
friend
bates
was
a
distant
cousin
and
rawson
father
was
the
master
of
a
small
grammar
school
in
the
north
with
which
certain
ancestral
horburys
were
somehow
connected
the
old
grange
was
a
fine
large
caroline
house
it
had
a
grave
front
of
red
brick
mellowed
with
age
tier
upon
tier
of
tall
narrow
windows
flush
with
the
walls
and
a
roof
above
the
front
door
was
a
rich
and
curious
wooden
deeply
carven
and
within
there
was
plenty
of
excellent
panelling
and
some
good
mantelpieces
added
it
would
seem
somewhere
about
the
adam
period
horbury
had
seen
its
solid
and
comfortable
merits
and
had
bought
the
freehold
years
before
at
a
great
bargain
the
school
was
increasing
rapidly
even
in
those
days
and
he
knew
that
before
long
more
houses
would
be
required
if
he
left
lupton
he
would
be
able
to
let
the
old
grange
easily
he
might
almost
put
it
up
for
auction
and
the
rent
would
represent
a
return
of
fifty
per
cent
on
his
investment
many
of
the
rooms
were
large
of
a
size
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
boys
needs
and
at
a
very
trifling
expense
partitions
might
be
made
and
the
nine
or
ten
available
rooms
be
subdivided
into
studies
for
twenty
or
even
boys
nature
had
gifted
the
high
usher
with
a
careful
provident
mind
in
all
things
both
great
and
small
and
it
is
but
fair
to
add
that
on
his
leaving
lupton
for
wareham
he
found
his
anticipations
more
than
justified
to
this
day
charles
horbury
his
nephew
a
high
government
official
draws
a
comfortable
income
from
his
uncle
most
prudent
investment
and
the
house
easily
holds
its
boys
rainy
who
took
the
place
from
horbury
was
an
ingenious
fellow
and
hit
upon
a
capital
plan
for
avoiding
the
expense
of
making
new
windows
for
some
of
the
subdivided
studies
after
thoughtful
consideration
he
caused
the
wooden
partitions
which
were
put
up
to
stop
short
of
the
ceiling
by
four
inches
and
by
this
device
the
study
with
a
window
lighted
the
study
that
had
none
and
as
rainy
explained
to
some
of
the
parents
a
diffused
light
was
really
better
for
the
eyes
than
a
direct
one
in
the
old
days
when
ambrose
meyrick
was
being
made
a
man
of
the
four
boys
rattled
as
it
were
in
the
big
house
they
were
scattered
about
in
odd
corners
remote
from
each
other
and
it
seemed
from
everybody
else
meyrick
room
was
the
most
isolated
of
any
but
it
was
also
the
most
comfortable
in
winter
since
it
was
over
the
kitchen
to
the
extreme
left
of
the
house
this
part
which
was
hidden
from
the
road
by
the
boughs
of
a
great
cedar
was
an
a
georgian
addition
in
grey
brick
and
rose
only
to
two
stories
and
in
the
one
furnished
room
out
of
the
three
or
four
over
the
kitchen
and
offices
slept
ambrose
he
wished
his
days
could
be
as
quiet
and
retired
as
his
nights
he
loved
the
shadows
that
were
about
his
bed
even
on
the
brightest
mornings
in
summer
for
the
cedar
boughs
were
dense
and
ivy
had
been
allowed
to
creep
about
the
panes
of
the
window
so
the
light
entered
dim
and
green
filtered
through
the
dark
boughs
and
the
ivy
tendrils
here
then
after
the
hour
of
ten
each
night
he
dwelt
secure
now
and
again
horbury
would
pay
nocturnal
surprise
visits
to
see
that
all
lights
were
out
but
happily
the
stairs
at
the
end
of
the
passage
being
old
and
badly
fitted
gave
out
a
succession
of
cracks
like
pistol
shots
if
the
softest
foot
was
set
on
them
it
was
simple
therefore
on
hearing
the
first
of
these
reports
to
extinguish
the
candle
in
the
small
secret
lantern
held
warily
so
that
no
gleam
of
light
should
appear
from
under
the
door
and
to
conceal
the
lantern
under
the
one
wetted
one
finger
and
pinched
at
the
flame
so
there
was
no
smell
of
the
expiring
snuff
and
the
lantern
slide
was
carefully
drawn
to
guard
against
the
possibility
of
suspicious
on
the
linen
it
was
perfect
and
old
horbury
visits
which
were
rare
enough
had
no
terrors
for
ambrose
so
that
night
while
the
venom
of
the
cane
still
rankled
in
his
body
though
it
had
ceased
to
disturb
his
mind
instead
of
going
to
bed
at
once
according
to
the
regulations
he
sat
for
a
while
on
his
box
seeking
a
clue
in
a
maze
of
odd
fancies
and
conceits
he
took
off
his
clothes
and
wrapped
his
aching
body
in
the
rug
from
the
bed
and
presently
blowing
out
the
official
paraffin
lamp
he
lit
his
candle
ready
at
the
first
warning
creak
on
the
stairs
to
douse
the
glim
and
leap
between
the
sheets
odd
enough
were
his
first
cogitations
he
was
thinking
how
very
sorry
he
was
to
have
hit
pelly
that
savage
blow
and
to
have
endangered
eyesight
by
the
hard
boards
of
the
dictionary
this
was
eccentric
for
he
had
endured
from
those
two
young
apaches
every
extremity
of
unpleasantness
for
upwards
of
a
couple
of
years
pelly
was
not
by
any
means
an
evil
lad
he
was
stupid
and
beefy
within
and
without
and
the
great
public
school
system
was
transmuting
him
in
the
proper
course
and
by
the
proper
steps
into
one
of
those
brave
average
boobies
whom
meyrick
used
to
rail
against
afterwards
pelly
in
all
probability
his
fortunes
have
not
been
traced
went
into
the
army
and
led
the
milder
and
more
serious
subalterns
the
devil
own
life
in
india
he
lay
doggo
with
great
success
against
some
hill
tribe
armed
with
muskets
and
rather
barbarous
knives
he
seems
to
have
been
present
at
that
conference
of
the
powers
described
so
brightly
by
kipling
promoted
to
a
captaincy
he
fought
with
conspicuous
bravery
in
south
africa
winning
the
victoria
cross
for
his
rescue
of
a
wounded
private
at
the
instant
risk
of
his
own
life
and
he
finally
led
his
troop
into
a
snare
set
by
an
old
farmer
a
rabbit
of
average
intelligence
would
have
smelt
and
evaded
it
for
rawson
one
is
sorry
but
one
can
not
in
conscience
say
much
that
is
good
though
he
has
been
praised
for
his
tact
he
became
domestic
chaplain
to
the
bishop
of
dorchester
whose
daughter
emily
he
married
but
in
those
old
days
there
was
very
little
to
choose
between
them
from
meyrick
point
of
view
each
had
displayed
a
quite
devilish
ingenuity
in
the
art
of
annoyance
in
the
whole
cycle
of
jeers
and
sneers
and
scores
as
known
to
the
schoolboy
and
they
were
just
proceeding
to
more
active
measures
meyrick
had
borne
it
all
meekly
he
had
returned
kindly
and
sometimes
quaint
answers
to
the
unceasing
stream
of
remarks
that
were
meant
to
wound
his
feelings
to
make
him
look
a
fool
before
any
boys
that
happened
to
be
about
he
had
only
countered
with
a
mild
what
do
you
do
that
for
pelly
when
the
brave
one
smacked
his
head
because
i
hate
sneaks
and
funks
pelly
had
replied
and
meyrick
said
no
more
rawson
took
a
smaller
size
in
victims
when
it
was
a
question
of
physical
torments
but
he
had
invented
a
most
offensive
tale
about
meyrick
and
had
told
it
all
over
the
school
where
it
was
universally
believed
in
a
word
the
two
had
done
their
utmost
to
reduce
him
to
a
state
of
utter
misery
and
now
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
punched
the
nose
of
one
and
bombarded
the
other
with
a
dictionary
the
fact
was
that
his
forebearance
had
not
been
all
cowardice
it
is
indeed
doubtful
whether
he
was
in
the
real
sense
a
coward
at
all
he
went
in
fear
it
is
true
all
his
days
but
what
he
feared
was
not
the
insult
but
the
intention
the
malignancy
of
which
the
insult
or
the
blow
was
the
outward
sign
the
fear
of
a
mad
bull
is
quite
distinct
from
the
horror
with
which
most
people
look
upon
a
viper
it
was
the
latter
feeling
which
made
meyrick
life
a
burden
to
him
and
again
there
was
a
more
curious
shade
of
feeling
and
that
was
the
intense
hatred
that
he
felt
to
the
mere
thought
of
scoring
off
an
antagonist
of
beating
down
the
enemy
he
was
a
much
sharper
lad
than
either
rawson
or
pelly
he
could
have
retorted
again
and
again
with
crushing
effect
but
he
held
his
tongue
for
all
such
victories
were
detestable
to
him
and
this
odd
sentiment
governed
all
his
actions
and
feelings
he
disliked
going
up
in
form
he
disliked
winning
a
game
not
through
any
acquired
virtue
but
by
inherent
nature
poe
would
have
understood
meyrick
feelings
but
then
the
author
of
imp
of
the
penetrated
so
deeply
into
the
inmost
secrets
of
humanity
that
criticism
has
agreed
in
denouncing
him
as
a
wholly
inhuman
writer
with
meyrick
this
mode
of
feeling
had
grown
stronger
by
provocation
the
more
he
was
injured
the
more
he
shrank
from
the
thought
of
returning
the
injury
in
a
great
measure
the
sentiment
remained
with
him
in
later
life
he
would
sally
forth
from
his
den
in
quest
of
fresh
air
on
top
of
an
omnibus
and
stroll
peacefully
back
again
rather
than
struggle
for
victory
with
the
furious
crowd
it
was
not
so
much
that
he
disliked
the
physical
contest
he
was
afraid
of
getting
a
seat
quite
naturally
he
said
that
people
who
pushed
in
the
metaphorical
sense
always
reminded
him
of
the
hungry
little
pigs
fighting
for
the
largest
share
of
the
wash
but
he
seemed
to
think
that
whereas
this
course
of
action
was
natural
in
the
little
pigs
it
was
profoundly
unnatural
in
the
little
men
but
in
his
early
boyhood
he
had
carried
this
secret
doctrine
of
his
to
its
utmost
limits
he
had
assumed
as
it
were
the
r√¥le
of
the
coward
and
the
funk
he
had
without
any
conscious
religious
motive
certainly
but
in
obedience
to
an
inward
command
endeavoured
to
play
the
part
of
a
primitive
christian
of
a
religious
in
a
great
public
school
nesciri
et
pro
nihilo
the
maxim
was
certainly
in
his
heart
though
he
had
never
heard
it
but
perhaps
if
he
had
searched
the
whole
world
over
he
could
not
have
found
a
more
impossible
field
for
its
exercise
than
this
seminary
where
the
broad
liberal
principles
of
christianity
were
taught
in
a
way
that
satisfied
the
press
the
public
and
the
parents
and
he
sat
in
his
room
and
grieved
over
the
fashion
in
which
he
had
broken
this
discipline
still
something
had
to
be
done
he
was
compelled
to
stay
in
this
place
and
he
did
not
wish
to
be
reduced
to
the
imbecility
of
wretched
little
phipps
who
had
become
at
last
more
like
a
whimpering
kitten
with
the
mange
than
a
human
being
one
had
not
the
right
to
allow
oneself
to
be
made
an
idiot
so
the
principle
had
to
be
infringed
but
externally
only
never
internally
of
that
he
was
firmly
resolved
and
he
felt
secure
in
his
recollection
that
there
had
been
no
anger
in
his
heart
he
resented
the
presence
of
pelly
and
rawson
certainly
but
in
the
manner
with
which
some
people
resent
the
presence
of
a
cat
a
mouse
or
a
as
disagreeable
objects
which
ca
help
being
disagreeable
objects
but
his
bashing
of
pelly
and
his
smashing
of
rawson
his
remarks
gathered
from
careful
observation
by
the
banks
of
the
lupton
and
birmingham
canal
all
this
had
been
but
the
means
to
an
end
the
securing
of
peace
and
quiet
for
the
future
he
would
not
be
murdered
by
this
infernal
public
school
system
either
after
the
fashion
of
phipps
which
was
melancholy
or
after
the
fashion
of
the
rest
which
was
more
melancholy
still
since
it
is
easier
to
recover
from
nervous
breakdown
than
from
suffusion
of
cant
through
the
entire
system
mental
and
spiritual
utterly
from
his
heart
he
abjured
and
renounced
all
the
horrible
shibboleths
of
the
school
its
sham
enthusiasm
its
ethos
its
tone
its
loyal
masters
and
boys
working
together
for
the
good
of
the
whole
school
all
its
ridiculous
fetish
conventions
and
absurd
observances
the
joint
contrivances
of
young
fools
and
old
knaves
but
his
resistance
should
be
secret
and
not
open
for
a
while
there
should
be
no
more
bashing
than
was
absolutely
necessary
and
one
thing
he
resolved
upon
he
would
make
all
he
could
out
of
the
place
he
would
work
like
a
tiger
and
get
all
the
latin
and
greek
and
french
obtainable
in
spite
of
the
teaching
and
its
imbecile
pedantry
the
school
work
must
be
done
so
that
trouble
might
be
avoided
but
here
at
night
in
his
room
he
would
really
learn
the
languages
they
pottered
over
in
form
wasting
half
their
time
in
writing
sham
ciceronian
prose
which
would
have
made
cicero
sick
and
verse
evil
enough
to
cause
virgil
to
vomit
then
there
was
french
taught
chiefly
out
of
pompous
fooleries
with
lists
of
irregular
verbs
to
learn
and
babylonish
nonsense
about
the
past
participle
and
many
other
rotten
formulas
and
rules
giving
to
the
whole
tongue
the
air
of
a
tiresome
puzzle
which
had
been
dug
up
out
of
a
prehistoric
grave
this
was
not
the
french
that
he
wanted
still
he
could
write
out
irregular
verbs
by
day
and
learn
the
language
at
night
he
wondered
whether
unhappy
french
boys
had
to
learn
english
out
of
the
blair
and
young
for
he
had
some
sort
of
smattering
of
english
literature
which
a
public
school
boy
has
no
business
to
possess
so
he
went
on
with
this
mental
tirade
of
his
one
is
not
at
fifteen
it
is
true
enough
perhaps
that
the
french
of
the
average
english
schoolboy
is
something
fit
to
move
only
pity
and
terror
it
may
be
true
also
that
nobody
except
deans
and
schoolmasters
seems
to
bring
away
even
the
formulas
and
sacred
teachings
such
as
the
optative
mystery
and
the
doctrine
of
dum
of
the
two
great
literatures
there
is
doubtless
a
good
deal
to
be
said
on
the
subject
of
the
public
schoolman
knowledge
of
the
history
and
literature
of
his
own
country
an
infinite
deal
of
comic
stuff
might
be
got
out
of
his
views
and
acquirements
in
the
great
science
of
theology
still
let
us
say
meyrick
turned
from
his
review
of
the
wisdom
of
his
elders
and
instructors
to
more
intimate
concerns
there
were
a
few
cuts
of
that
vigorous
cane
which
still
stung
and
hurt
most
abominably
for
skill
or
fortune
had
guided
horbury
hand
so
that
he
had
been
enabled
here
and
there
to
get
home
twice
in
the
same
place
and
there
was
one
particular
weal
on
the
left
arm
where
the
flesh
purple
and
discoloured
had
swelled
up
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
bursting
it
was
no
longer
with
rage
but
with
a
kind
of
rapture
that
he
felt
the
pain
and
smarting
he
looked
upon
the
ugly
marks
of
the
high
usher
evil
humours
as
though
they
had
been
a
robe
of
splendour
for
he
knew
nothing
of
that
bad
sherry
nothing
of
the
head
conversation
he
knew
that
when
pelly
had
come
in
quite
as
late
it
had
only
been
a
question
of
a
hundred
lines
and
so
he
persisted
in
regarding
himself
as
a
martyr
in
the
cause
of
those
famous
norman
arches
which
was
the
cause
of
that
dear
dead
enthusiast
his
father
who
loved
gothic
architecture
and
all
other
beautiful
unpractical
things
with
an
undying
passion
as
soon
as
ambrose
could
walk
he
had
begun
his
pilgrimages
to
hidden
mystic
shrines
his
father
had
led
him
over
the
wild
lands
to
places
known
perhaps
only
to
himself
and
there
by
the
ruined
stones
by
the
smooth
hillock
had
told
the
tale
of
the
old
vanished
time
the
time
of
the
old
saints
iii
it
was
for
this
blessed
and
wonderful
learning
he
said
to
himself
that
he
had
been
beaten
that
his
body
had
been
scored
with
red
and
purple
stripes
he
remembered
his
father
exclamation
cythrawl
sais
he
understood
that
the
phrase
damned
not
englishmen
englishmen
but
the
power
of
the
creed
that
builds
manchester
that
does
business
that
invents
popular
dissent
representative
government
adulteration
suburbs
and
the
public
school
system
it
was
according
to
his
father
the
creed
of
the
prince
of
this
world
the
creed
that
made
for
comfort
success
a
good
balance
at
the
bank
the
praise
of
men
the
sensible
and
tangible
victory
and
achievement
and
he
bade
his
little
boy
who
heard
everything
and
understood
next
to
nothing
fly
from
it
hate
it
and
fight
against
it
as
he
would
fight
against
the
devil
and
he
would
add
it
the
only
devil
you
are
ever
likely
to
come
across
and
the
little
ambrose
had
understood
not
much
of
all
this
and
if
he
had
been
asked
even
at
fifteen
what
it
all
meant
he
would
probably
have
said
that
it
was
a
great
issue
between
norman
mouldings
and
horbury
an
armageddon
of
selden
abbey
rocker
indeed
it
is
doubtful
whether
old
nicholas
meyrick
would
have
been
very
much
clearer
for
he
forgot
everything
that
might
be
said
on
the
other
side
he
forgot
that
save
in
the
united
states
of
america
makes
generally
for
equal
laws
that
civil
riot
labour
movements
of
course
excepted
is
more
a
celtic
than
a
saxon
vice
that
the
penalty
of
burning
alive
is
unknown
amongst
unless
the
provocation
be
extreme
that
englishmen
have
substituted
indentured
labour
for
the
horrors
of
slavery
that
english
justice
smites
the
guilty
rich
equally
with
the
guilty
poor
that
men
are
no
longer
poisoned
with
swift
and
secret
drugs
though
somewhat
unwholesome
food
may
still
be
sold
very
occasionally
indeed
the
old
meyrick
once
told
his
rector
that
he
considered
a
brothel
a
house
of
sanctity
compared
with
a
modern
factory
and
he
was
beginning
to
relate
some
interesting
tales
concerning
the
three
gracious
courtesans
of
the
isle
of
britain
when
the
rector
fled
in
horror
he
came
from
sydenham
and
all
this
was
a
nice
preparation
for
lupton
a
wonderful
joy
an
ecstasy
of
bliss
swelled
in
ambrose
heart
as
he
assured
himself
that
he
was
a
witness
though
a
mean
one
for
the
old
faith
for
the
faith
of
secret
and
beautiful
and
hidden
mysteries
as
opposed
to
the
faith
of
rocker
and
sticker
and
mucker
and
the
thought
of
the
school
as
an
inspiring
motive
in
life
the
text
on
which
the
head
had
preached
the
sunday
before
he
bared
his
arms
and
kissed
the
purple
swollen
flesh
and
prayed
that
it
might
ever
be
so
that
in
body
and
mind
and
spirit
he
might
ever
be
beaten
and
reviled
and
made
ridiculous
for
the
sacred
things
that
he
might
ever
be
on
the
side
of
the
despised
and
the
unsuccessful
that
his
life
might
ever
be
in
the
shadow
in
the
shadow
of
the
mysteries
he
thought
of
the
place
in
which
he
was
of
the
hideous
school
the
hideous
town
the
weary
waves
of
the
dun
midland
scenery
bounded
by
the
dim
hopeless
horizon
and
his
soul
revisited
the
faery
hills
and
woods
and
valleys
of
the
west
he
remembered
how
long
ago
his
father
had
roused
him
early
from
sleep
in
the
hush
and
wonder
of
a
summer
morning
the
whole
world
was
still
and
windless
all
the
magic
odours
of
the
night
rose
from
the
earth
and
as
they
crossed
the
lawn
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
enchanted
song
of
a
bird
rising
from
a
thorn
tree
by
the
gate
a
high
white
vapour
veiled
the
sky
and
they
only
knew
that
the
sun
had
risen
by
the
brightening
of
this
veil
by
the
silvering
of
the
woods
and
the
meadows
and
the
water
in
the
rejoicing
brook
they
crossed
the
road
and
crossed
the
brook
in
the
field
beneath
by
the
old
tremulous
with
age
and
began
to
climb
the
steep
hillside
that
one
could
see
from
the
windows
and
the
ridge
of
the
hill
once
surmounted
the
little
boy
found
himself
in
an
unknown
land
he
looked
into
deep
silent
valleys
watered
by
trickling
streams
he
saw
still
woods
in
that
dreamlike
morning
air
he
saw
winding
paths
that
climbed
into
yet
remoter
regions
his
father
led
him
onward
till
they
came
to
a
lonely
height
they
had
walked
scarcely
two
miles
but
to
ambrose
it
seemed
a
journey
into
another
world
and
showed
him
certain
irregular
markings
in
the
turf
and
nicholas
meyrick
murmured
the
cell
of
iltyd
is
by
the
seashore
the
ninth
wave
washes
its
altar
there
is
a
fair
shrine
in
the
land
of
morgan
the
cell
of
dewi
is
in
the
city
of
the
legions
nine
altars
owe
obedience
to
it
sovereign
is
the
choir
that
sings
about
it
the
cell
of
cybi
is
the
treasure
of
gwent
nine
hills
are
its
perpetual
guardians
nine
songs
befit
the
memory
of
the
saint
see
he
said
there
are
the
nine
hills
he
pointed
them
out
to
the
boy
telling
him
the
tale
of
the
saint
and
his
holy
bell
which
they
said
had
sailed
across
the
sea
from
syon
and
had
entered
the
severn
and
had
entered
the
usk
and
had
entered
the
soar
and
had
entered
the
canthwr
and
so
one
day
the
saint
as
he
walked
beside
the
little
brook
that
almost
encompassed
the
hill
in
its
winding
course
saw
the
bell
that
was
made
of
metal
that
no
man
might
comprehend
floating
under
the
alders
and
crying
sant
sant
i
sail
from
syon
to
cybi
sant
and
so
sweet
was
the
sound
of
that
bell
ambrose
father
went
on
that
they
said
it
was
as
the
joy
of
angels
and
that
it
must
have
come
not
from
the
earthly
but
from
the
heavenly
and
glorious
syon
and
there
they
stood
in
the
white
morning
on
the
uneven
ground
that
marked
the
place
where
once
the
saint
rang
to
the
sacrifice
where
the
quickening
words
were
uttered
after
the
order
of
the
old
mass
of
the
britons
and
then
came
the
yellow
hag
of
pestilence
that
destroyed
the
bodies
of
the
cymri
then
the
red
hag
of
rome
that
caused
their
souls
to
stray
last
is
come
the
black
hag
of
geneva
that
sends
body
and
soul
quick
to
hell
no
honour
have
the
saints
any
more
then
they
turned
home
again
and
all
the
way
ambrose
thought
he
heard
the
bell
as
it
sailed
the
great
deeps
from
syon
crying
aloud
sant
sant
sant
and
the
sound
seemed
to
echo
from
the
glassy
water
of
the
little
brook
as
it
swirled
and
rippled
over
the
shining
stones
circling
round
those
lonely
hills
so
they
made
strange
pilgrimages
over
the
beloved
land
going
farther
and
farther
afield
as
the
boy
grew
older
they
visited
deep
wells
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
where
a
few
broken
stones
perhaps
were
the
last
remains
of
the
hermitage
ffynnon
ilar
bysgootwr
the
well
of
saint
ilar
the
fisherman
nicholas
meyrick
would
explain
and
then
would
follow
the
story
of
ilar
how
no
man
knew
whence
he
came
or
who
his
parents
were
he
was
found
a
little
child
on
a
stone
in
a
river
in
armorica
by
king
alan
and
rescued
by
him
and
ever
after
they
discovered
on
the
stone
in
the
river
where
the
child
had
lain
every
day
a
great
and
shining
fish
lying
and
on
this
fish
ilar
was
nourished
and
so
he
came
with
a
great
company
of
the
saints
to
britain
and
wandered
over
all
the
land
so
at
last
ilar
sant
came
to
this
wood
which
people
now
call
hilary
wood
because
they
have
forgotten
all
about
ilar
and
he
was
weary
with
his
wandering
and
the
day
was
very
hot
so
he
stayed
by
this
well
and
began
to
drink
and
there
on
that
great
stone
he
saw
the
shining
fish
and
so
he
rested
and
built
an
altar
and
a
church
of
willow
boughs
and
offered
the
sacrifice
not
only
for
the
quick
and
the
dead
but
for
all
the
wild
beasts
of
the
woods
and
the
streams
and
when
this
blessed
ilar
rang
his
holy
bell
and
began
to
offer
there
came
not
only
the
prince
and
his
servants
but
all
the
creatures
of
the
wood
there
under
the
hazel
boughs
you
might
see
the
hare
which
flies
so
swiftly
from
men
come
gently
and
fall
down
weeping
greatly
on
account
of
the
passion
of
the
son
of
mary
and
beside
the
hare
the
weasel
and
the
would
lament
grievously
in
the
manner
of
penitent
sinners
and
wolves
and
lambs
together
adored
the
hierurgy
and
men
have
beheld
tears
streaming
from
the
eyes
of
venomous
serpents
when
ilar
agios
uttered
with
a
loud
voice
since
the
serpent
is
not
ignorant
that
by
its
wickedness
sorrow
came
to
the
whole
world
and
when
in
the
time
of
the
holy
ministry
it
is
necessary
that
frequent
alleluyas
should
be
chanted
and
vociferated
the
saint
wondered
what
should
be
done
for
as
yet
none
in
that
place
was
skilled
in
the
art
of
song
then
was
a
great
miracle
since
from
all
the
boughs
of
the
wood
from
every
bush
and
from
every
green
tree
there
resounded
alleluyas
in
enchanting
and
prolonged
harmony
never
did
the
bishop
of
rome
listen
to
so
sweet
a
singing
in
his
church
as
was
heard
in
this
wood
for
the
nightingale
and
thrush
and
blackbird
and
blackcap
and
all
their
companions
are
gathered
together
and
sing
praises
to
the
lord
chanting
distinct
notes
and
yet
concluding
in
a
melody
of
most
ravishing
sweetness
such
was
the
mass
of
the
fisherman
nor
was
this
all
for
one
day
as
the
saint
prayed
beside
the
well
he
became
aware
that
a
bee
circled
round
and
round
his
head
uttering
loud
buzzing
sounds
but
not
endeavouring
to
sting
him
to
be
short
the
bee
went
before
ilar
and
led
him
to
a
hollow
tree
not
far
off
and
straightway
a
swarm
of
bees
issued
forth
leaving
a
vast
store
of
wax
behind
them
this
was
their
oblation
to
the
most
high
for
from
their
wax
ilar
sant
made
goodly
candles
to
burn
at
the
offering
and
from
that
time
the
bee
is
holy
because
his
wax
makes
light
to
shine
upon
the
gifts
this
was
part
of
the
story
that
ambrose
father
read
to
him
and
they
went
again
to
see
the
holy
well
he
looked
at
the
few
broken
and
uneven
stones
that
were
left
to
distinguish
it
from
common
wells
and
there
in
the
deep
green
wood
in
the
summer
afternoon
under
the
woven
boughs
he
seemed
to
hear
the
strange
sound
of
the
saint
bell
to
see
the
woodland
creatures
hurrying
through
the
undergrowth
that
they
might
be
present
at
the
offering
the
weasel
beat
his
little
breast
for
his
sins
the
big
tears
fell
down
the
gentle
face
of
the
hare
the
adders
wept
in
the
dust
and
all
the
chorus
of
the
birds
sang
alleluya
alleluya
alleluya
once
they
drove
a
long
way
from
the
wern
going
towards
the
west
till
they
came
to
the
great
mountain
as
the
people
called
it
after
they
had
turned
from
the
high
road
they
went
down
a
narrow
lane
and
this
led
them
with
many
windings
to
a
lower
ridge
of
the
mountain
where
the
horse
and
trap
were
put
up
at
a
solitary
tavern
then
they
began
to
toil
upward
on
foot
crossing
many
glistening
and
rejoicing
streams
that
rushed
out
cold
from
the
limestone
rock
mounting
up
and
up
through
the
wet
land
where
the
rare
orchis
grew
amongst
the
rushes
through
hazel
brakes
through
fields
that
grew
wilder
as
they
still
went
higher
and
the
great
wind
came
down
from
the
high
dome
above
them
they
turned
and
all
the
shining
land
was
unrolled
before
them
the
white
houses
were
bright
in
the
sunlight
and
there
far
away
was
the
yellow
sea
and
the
two
islands
and
the
coasts
beyond
nicholas
meyrick
pointed
out
a
tuft
of
trees
on
a
hill
a
long
way
off
and
told
his
son
that
the
wern
was
hidden
beyond
it
and
then
they
began
to
climb
once
more
till
they
came
at
last
to
the
line
where
the
fields
and
hedges
ended
and
above
there
was
only
the
wild
mountain
land
and
on
this
verge
stood
an
old
farmhouse
with
strong
walls
set
into
the
rock
sheltered
a
little
from
the
winds
by
a
line
of
twisted
beeches
the
walls
of
the
house
were
gleaming
white
and
by
the
porch
there
was
a
shrub
covered
with
bright
yellow
flowers
meyrick
beat
upon
the
oak
door
painted
black
and
studded
with
heavy
nails
an
old
man
dressed
like
a
farmer
opened
it
and
ambrose
noticed
that
his
father
spoke
to
him
with
something
of
reverence
in
his
voice
as
if
he
were
some
very
great
person
they
sat
down
in
a
long
room
but
dimly
lighted
by
the
thick
greenish
glass
in
the
quarried
window
and
presently
the
old
farmer
set
a
great
jug
of
beer
before
them
they
both
drank
heartily
enough
and
meyrick
said
are
you
about
the
last
to
brew
your
own
beer
mr
cradock
iss
i
be
the
last
of
all
they
do
all
like
the
muck
the
brewer
sends
better
than
the
whole
world
likes
muck
better
than
good
drink
now
you
be
right
sir
old
days
and
old
ways
of
our
fathers
they
be
gone
for
ever
there
was
a
blasted
preacher
down
at
the
chapel
a
week
or
two
ago
saying
so
they
do
tell
me
that
they
would
all
be
damned
to
hell
unless
they
took
to
directly
iss
indeed
now
and
i
heard
that
he
should
say
that
a
man
could
do
a
better
day
work
on
that
stuff
than
on
good
beer
wass
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
liarr
as
that
the
old
man
was
furious
at
the
thought
of
these
infamies
and
follies
his
esses
hissed
through
his
teeth
and
his
r
rolled
out
with
fierce
emphasis
meyrick
nodded
his
approval
of
this
indignation
we
have
what
we
deserve
he
said
false
preachers
bad
drink
the
talk
of
fools
all
the
day
long
even
on
the
mountain
what
is
it
like
do
you
think
in
london
there
fell
a
silence
in
the
long
dark
room
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
the
beech
trees
and
ambrose
saw
how
the
boughs
were
tossed
to
and
fro
and
he
thought
of
what
it
must
be
like
in
winter
nights
here
high
upon
the
great
mountain
when
the
storms
swept
up
from
the
sea
or
descended
from
the
wilds
of
the
north
when
the
shafts
of
rain
were
like
the
onset
of
an
army
and
the
winds
screamed
about
the
walls
may
we
see
it
said
meyrick
suddenly
i
did
think
you
had
come
for
that
there
be
very
few
now
that
remember
he
went
out
and
returned
carrying
a
bunch
of
keys
then
he
opened
a
door
in
the
room
and
warned
the
young
master
to
take
care
of
the
steps
ambrose
indeed
could
scarcely
see
the
way
his
father
led
him
down
a
short
flight
of
uneven
stone
steps
and
they
were
in
a
room
which
seemed
at
first
quite
dark
for
the
only
light
came
from
a
narrow
window
high
up
in
the
wall
and
across
the
glass
there
were
heavy
iron
bars
cradock
lit
two
tall
candles
of
yellow
wax
that
stood
in
brass
candlesticks
on
a
table
and
as
the
flame
grew
clear
ambrose
saw
that
he
was
opening
a
sort
of
aumbry
constructed
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
the
door
was
a
great
slab
of
solid
oak
three
or
four
inches
thick
as
one
could
see
when
it
was
opened
and
from
the
dark
place
within
the
farmer
took
an
iron
box
and
set
it
carefully
upon
the
floor
meyrick
helping
him
they
were
strong
men
but
they
staggered
under
the
weight
of
the
chest
the
iron
seemed
as
thick
as
the
door
of
the
cupboard
from
which
it
was
taken
and
the
heavy
antique
lock
yielded
with
a
grating
scream
to
the
key
inside
it
there
was
another
box
of
some
reddish
metal
which
again
held
a
case
of
wood
black
with
age
and
from
this
with
reverent
hands
the
farmer
drew
out
a
veiled
and
splendid
cup
and
set
it
on
the
table
between
the
two
candles
it
was
a
vessel
of
the
most
wonderful
workmanship
standing
on
a
short
stem
all
the
hues
of
the
world
were
mingled
on
it
all
the
jewels
of
the
regions
seemed
to
shine
from
it
and
the
stem
and
foot
were
encrusted
with
work
in
enamel
of
strange
and
magical
colours
that
shone
and
dimmed
with
alternating
radiance
that
glowed
with
red
fires
and
pale
glories
with
the
blue
of
the
far
sky
the
green
of
the
faery
seas
and
the
argent
gleam
of
the
evening
star
but
before
ambrose
had
gazed
more
than
a
moment
he
heard
the
old
man
say
in
pure
welsh
not
in
broken
english
in
a
resonant
and
chanting
voice
let
us
fall
down
and
adore
the
marvellous
and
venerable
work
of
the
lord
god
almighty
to
which
his
father
responded
agyos
agyos
agyos
mighty
and
glorious
is
the
lord
god
almighty
in
all
his
works
and
wonderful
operations
curiluson
curiluson
curiluson
they
knelt
down
cradock
in
the
midst
before
the
cup
and
ambrose
and
his
father
on
either
hand
the
holy
vessel
gleamed
before
the
eyes
and
he
saw
clearly
its
wonder
and
its
beauty
all
its
surface
was
a
marvel
of
the
most
delicate
intertwining
lines
in
gold
and
silver
in
copper
and
in
bronze
in
all
manner
of
metals
and
alloys
and
these
interlacing
patterns
in
their
brightness
in
the
strangeness
of
their
imagery
and
ornament
seemed
to
enthral
his
eyes
and
capture
them
as
it
were
in
a
maze
of
enchantment
and
not
only
the
eyes
for
the
very
spirit
was
rapt
and
garnered
into
that
far
bright
world
whence
the
holy
magic
of
the
cup
proceeded
among
the
precious
stones
which
were
set
into
the
wonder
was
a
great
crystal
shining
with
the
pure
light
of
the
moon
about
the
rim
of
it
there
was
the
appearance
of
faint
and
feathery
clouds
but
in
the
centre
it
was
a
white
splendour
and
as
ambrose
gazed
he
thought
that
from
the
heart
of
this
jewel
there
streamed
continually
a
shower
of
glittering
stars
dazzling
his
eyes
with
their
incessant
motion
and
brightness
his
body
thrilled
with
a
sudden
ineffable
rapture
his
breath
came
and
went
in
quick
pantings
bliss
possessed
him
utterly
as
the
three
crowned
forms
passed
in
their
golden
order
then
the
interwoven
sorcery
of
the
vessel
became
a
ringing
wood
of
golden
and
bronze
and
silver
trees
from
every
side
resounded
the
clear
summons
of
the
holy
bells
and
the
exultant
song
of
the
faery
birds
he
no
longer
heard
the
voices
of
cradock
and
his
father
as
they
replied
to
one
another
in
the
forms
of
some
antique
liturgy
then
he
stood
by
a
wild
seashore
it
was
a
dark
night
and
there
was
a
shrilling
wind
that
sang
about
the
peaks
of
the
sharp
rock
answering
to
the
deep
voices
of
the
heaving
sea
a
white
moon
of
fourteen
days
old
appeared
for
a
moment
in
the
rift
between
two
vast
black
clouds
and
the
shaft
of
light
showed
all
the
savage
desolation
of
the
shore
cliffs
that
rose
up
into
mountains
into
crenellated
heights
that
were
incredible
whose
bases
were
scourged
by
the
torrents
of
hissing
foam
that
were
driven
against
them
from
the
sea
then
on
the
highest
of
those
awful
heights
ambrose
became
aware
of
walls
and
spires
of
towers
and
battlements
that
must
have
touched
the
stars
and
in
the
midst
of
this
great
castle
there
surged
up
the
aspiring
vault
of
a
vast
church
and
all
its
windows
were
ablaze
with
a
light
so
white
and
glorious
that
it
was
as
if
every
pane
were
a
diamond
and
he
heard
the
voices
of
a
praising
host
or
the
clamour
of
golden
trumpets
and
the
unceasing
choir
of
the
angels
and
he
knew
that
this
place
was
the
sovereign
perpetual
choir
into
whose
secret
the
deadly
flesh
may
scarcely
enter
but
in
the
vision
he
lay
breathless
on
the
floor
before
the
gleaming
wall
of
the
sanctuary
while
the
shadows
of
the
hierurgy
were
enacted
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
for
a
moment
of
time
he
saw
in
unendurable
light
the
mystery
of
mysteries
pass
veiled
before
him
and
the
image
of
the
slain
and
risen
for
a
brief
while
this
dream
was
broken
he
heard
his
father
singing
softly
gogoniant
y
t√¢d
ac
y
mab
ac
yr
yspryd
gl√¢n
and
the
old
man
answered
agya
trias
eleeson
ymas
then
again
his
spirit
was
lost
in
the
bright
depths
of
the
crystal
and
he
saw
the
ships
of
the
saints
without
oar
or
sail
afloat
on
the
faery
sea
seeking
the
glassy
isle
all
the
whole
company
of
the
blessed
saints
of
the
isle
of
britain
sailed
on
the
adventure
dawn
and
sunset
night
and
morning
their
illuminated
faces
never
wavered
and
ambrose
thought
that
at
last
they
saw
bright
shores
in
the
dying
light
of
a
red
sun
and
there
came
to
their
nostrils
the
scent
of
the
deep
in
avalon
and
odours
of
paradise
when
he
finally
returned
to
the
presence
of
earthly
things
he
was
standing
by
his
father
while
cradock
reverently
wrapped
the
cup
in
the
gleaming
veils
which
covered
it
saying
as
he
did
so
in
welsh
remain
in
peace
o
holy
and
divine
cup
of
the
lord
henceforth
i
know
not
whether
i
shall
return
to
thee
or
not
but
may
the
lord
vouchsafe
me
to
see
thee
in
the
church
of
the
firstborn
which
is
in
heaven
on
the
altar
of
the
sacrifice
which
is
from
age
unto
ages
ambrose
went
up
the
steps
and
out
into
the
sunshine
on
the
mountain
side
with
the
bewilderment
of
strange
dreams
as
a
coloured
mist
about
him
he
saw
the
old
white
walls
the
yellow
blossoms
by
the
porch
above
the
wild
high
mountain
wall
and
below
all
the
dear
land
of
gwent
happy
in
the
summer
air
all
its
woods
and
fields
its
rolling
hills
and
its
salt
verge
rich
in
a
golden
peace
beside
him
the
cold
water
swelled
from
the
earth
and
trickled
from
the
grey
rock
and
high
in
the
air
an
exultant
lark
was
singing
the
mountain
breeze
was
full
of
life
and
gladness
and
the
rustling
and
tossing
of
the
woods
the
glint
and
glimmer
of
the
leaves
beneath
made
one
think
that
the
trees
with
every
creature
were
merry
on
that
day
and
in
that
dark
cell
beneath
many
locks
beneath
wood
and
iron
concealed
in
golden
glittering
veils
lay
hidden
that
glorious
and
awful
cup
glass
of
wonderful
vision
portal
and
entrance
of
the
spiritual
place
his
father
explained
to
him
something
of
that
which
he
had
seen
he
told
him
that
the
vessel
was
the
holy
cup
of
teilo
sant
which
he
was
said
to
have
received
from
the
lord
in
the
state
of
paradise
and
that
when
teilo
said
mass
using
that
chalice
the
choir
of
angels
was
present
visibly
that
it
was
a
cup
of
wonders
and
mysteries
the
bestower
of
visions
and
heavenly
graces
but
whatever
you
do
he
said
do
not
speak
to
anyone
of
what
you
have
seen
because
if
you
do
the
mystery
will
be
laughed
at
and
blasphemed
do
you
know
that
your
uncle
and
aunt
at
lupton
would
say
that
we
were
all
mad
together
that
is
because
they
are
fools
and
in
these
days
most
people
are
fools
and
malignant
fools
too
as
you
will
find
out
for
yourself
before
you
are
much
older
so
always
remember
that
you
must
hide
the
secrets
that
you
have
seen
and
if
you
do
not
do
so
you
will
be
sorry
meyrick
told
his
son
why
old
cradock
was
to
be
treated
with
respect
indeed
with
reverence
he
is
just
what
he
looks
he
said
an
old
farmer
with
a
small
freehold
up
here
on
the
mountain
side
and
as
you
heard
his
english
is
no
better
than
that
of
any
other
farmer
in
this
country
and
compared
with
cradock
the
duke
of
norfolk
is
a
man
of
yesterday
he
is
of
the
tribe
of
teilo
the
saint
he
is
the
last
in
direct
descent
of
the
hereditary
keepers
of
the
holy
cup
and
his
race
has
guarded
that
blessed
relic
for
thirteen
hundred
years
remember
again
that
on
this
mountain
you
have
seen
great
marvels
which
you
must
keep
in
silence
poor
ambrose
he
suffered
afterwards
for
his
forgetfulness
of
his
father
injunction
soon
after
he
went
to
lupton
one
of
the
boys
was
astonishing
his
friends
with
a
brilliant
account
of
the
crown
jewels
which
he
had
viewed
during
the
christmas
holidays
everybody
was
deeply
impressed
and
young
meyrick
anxious
to
be
agreeable
in
his
turn
began
to
tell
about
the
wonderful
cup
that
he
had
once
seen
in
an
old
farmhouse
perhaps
his
manner
was
not
convincing
for
the
boys
shrieked
with
laughter
over
his
description
a
monitor
who
was
passing
asked
to
hear
the
joke
and
having
been
told
the
tale
clouted
ambrose
over
the
head
for
an
infernal
young
liar
this
was
a
good
lesson
and
it
served
ambrose
in
good
stead
when
one
of
the
masters
having
somehow
or
other
heard
the
story
congratulated
him
in
the
most
approved
scholastic
manner
before
the
whole
form
on
his
wonderful
imaginative
gifts
i
see
the
budding
novelist
in
you
meyrick
said
this
sly
master
besant
and
rice
will
be
nowhere
when
you
once
begin
i
suppose
you
are
studying
character
just
at
present
let
us
down
gently
wo
you
to
the
delighted
form
we
must
be
careful
must
we
how
we
behave
chiel
amang
us
takin
notes
etc
etc
but
meyrick
held
his
tongue
he
did
not
tell
his
form
master
that
he
was
a
beast
a
fool
and
a
coward
since
he
had
found
out
that
the
truth
like
many
precious
things
must
often
be
concealed
from
the
profane
a
late
vengeance
overtook
that
foolish
master
long
years
after
he
was
dining
at
a
popular
london
restaurant
and
all
through
dinner
he
had
delighted
the
ladies
of
his
party
by
the
artful
mixture
of
brutal
insolence
and
vulgar
chaff
with
which
he
had
treated
one
of
the
waiters
a
little
italian
the
master
was
in
the
highest
spirits
at
the
success
of
his
persiflage
his
voice
rose
louder
and
louder
and
his
offensiveness
became
almost
supernaturally
acute
and
then
he
received
a
heavy
earthen
casserole
six
quails
a
few
small
onions
and
a
quantity
of
savoury
but
boiling
juices
full
in
the
face
the
waiter
was
a
neapolitan
the
hours
of
the
night
passed
on
as
ambrose
sat
in
his
bedroom
at
the
old
grange
recalling
many
wonderful
memories
dreaming
his
dreams
of
the
mysteries
of
the
land
of
gwent
and
the
land
of
vision
just
as
his
uncle
but
a
few
yards
away
in
another
room
of
the
house
was
at
the
same
time
rapt
into
the
world
of
imagination
seeing
the
new
lupton
descending
like
a
bride
from
the
heaven
of
headmasters
but
ambrose
thought
of
the
great
mountain
of
the
secret
valleys
of
the
sanctuaries
and
hallows
of
the
saints
of
the
rich
carven
work
of
lonely
churches
hidden
amongst
the
hills
and
woods
there
came
into
his
mind
the
fragment
of
an
old
poem
which
he
loved
in
the
darkness
of
old
age
let
not
my
memory
fail
let
me
not
forget
to
celebrate
the
beloved
land
of
gwent
if
they
imprison
me
in
a
deep
place
in
a
house
of
pestilence
still
shall
i
be
free
when
i
remember
the
sunshine
upon
mynydd
maen
there
have
i
listened
to
the
singing
of
the
lark
my
soul
has
ascended
with
the
song
of
the
little
bird
the
great
white
clouds
were
the
ships
of
my
spirit
sailing
to
the
haven
of
the
almighty
equally
to
be
held
in
honour
is
the
site
of
the
great
mountain
adorned
with
the
gushing
of
many
waters
sweet
is
the
shade
of
its
hazel
thickets
there
a
treasure
is
preserved
which
i
will
not
celebrate
it
is
glorious
and
deeply
concealed
if
teilo
should
return
if
happiness
were
restored
to
the
cymri
dewi
and
dyfrig
should
serve
his
mass
then
a
great
marvel
would
be
made
visible
o
blessed
and
miraculous
work
then
should
my
bliss
be
as
the
bliss
of
angels
i
had
rather
behold
this
offering
than
kiss
the
twin
lips
of
dark
gwenllian
dear
my
land
of
gwent
quam
dilecta
thy
rivers
are
like
precious
golden
streams
of
paradise
thy
hills
are
as
the
mount
syon
better
a
grave
on
twyn
barlwm
than
a
throne
in
the
palace
of
the
saxons
at
and
then
by
the
face
of
contrast
he
thought
of
the
first
verse
of
the
great
school
song
rocker
one
of
the
earliest
of
the
many
poems
which
his
uncle
had
consecrated
to
the
praise
of
the
dear
old
school
once
on
a
time
in
the
books
that
bore
me
i
read
that
in
olden
days
before
me
lupton
town
had
a
wonderful
game
it
was
a
game
with
a
noble
story
lupton
town
was
then
in
its
glory
kings
and
bishops
had
brought
it
fame
it
was
a
game
that
you
all
must
know
and
they
called
it
long
ago
look
out
for
or
you
sure
to
drown
look
out
for
or
else
you
down
that
was
the
way
to
play
once
on
a
day
that
was
the
way
once
on
a
day
that
was
the
way
that
they
used
to
play
in
lupton
town
thinking
of
the
two
songs
he
put
out
his
light
and
wearied
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
iv
the
british
schoolboy
considered
in
a
genial
light
by
those
who
have
made
him
their
special
study
has
not
been
found
to
be
either
observant
or
imaginative
or
rather
it
would
be
well
to
say
that
his
powers
of
observation
having
been
highly
specialised
within
a
certain
limited
tract
of
thought
and
experience
bounded
mainly
by
cricket
and
football
are
but
faint
without
these
bounds
while
it
is
one
of
the
chiefest
works
of
the
system
to
kill
destroy
smash
and
bring
to
nothing
any
powers
of
imagination
he
may
have
originally
possessed
for
if
this
were
not
done
thoroughly
neither
a
conservative
nor
a
liberal
administration
would
be
possible
the
house
of
commons
itself
would
cease
to
exist
the
episcopus
var
anglicanus
would
go
the
way
of
the
great
bustard
a
muddling
through
somehow
which
must
have
been
brightest
jewel
in
the
british
crown
wrung
from
king
john
by
the
barons
would
become
a
lost
art
and
since
all
these
consequences
would
be
clearly
intolerable
the
great
public
schools
have
perfected
a
very
thorough
system
of
destroying
the
imaginative
toxin
and
few
cases
of
failure
have
been
so
far
reported
still
there
are
facts
which
not
even
the
densest
dullards
the
most
complete
boobies
can
help
seeing
and
a
good
many
of
the
boys
found
themselves
wondering
what
was
the
matter
with
meyrick
when
they
saw
him
at
chapel
on
the
sunday
morning
the
news
of
his
astounding
violences
both
of
act
and
word
on
the
night
before
had
not
yet
circulated
generally
bates
was
attending
to
that
department
but
had
time
to
do
much
so
far
and
the
replies
of
pelly
and
rawson
to
enquiries
after
black
eyes
and
a
nose
were
surly
and
misleading
afterwards
when
the
tale
was
told
when
bates
having
enlarged
the
incidents
to
size
showed
pelly
lying
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
rawson
screaming
as
with
the
torments
of
the
lost
and
meyrick
rolling
out
oaths
all
original
and
all
terrible
for
the
space
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
indeed
the
school
was
satisfied
it
was
no
wonder
if
meyrick
did
look
a
bit
queer
after
the
achievement
of
such
an
adventure
the
funk
of
aforetime
had
found
courage
the
air
of
rapture
was
easily
understood
it
is
probable
that
if
in
the
nature
of
things
it
had
been
possible
for
an
english
schoolboy
to
meet
francis
of
assisi
the
boy
would
have
concluded
that
the
saint
must
have
just
made
not
out
in
cricket
but
ambrose
walked
in
a
strange
light
he
had
been
admitted
into
worlds
undreamed
of
and
from
the
first
brightness
of
the
sun
when
he
awoke
in
the
morning
in
his
room
at
the
grange
it
was
the
material
world
about
him
the
walls
of
stone
and
brick
the
solid
earth
the
sky
itself
and
the
people
who
talked
and
moved
and
seemed
alive
these
were
things
of
vision
unsubstantial
shapes
odd
and
broken
illusions
of
the
mind
at
seven
old
toby
the
at
the
old
grange
banged
at
his
door
and
let
his
clean
boots
fall
with
a
crash
on
the
boards
after
the
usual
fashion
he
awoke
sat
up
in
bed
staring
about
him
but
what
was
this
the
four
walls
covered
with
a
foolish
speckled
paper
pale
blue
and
pale
brown
the
white
ceiling
the
bare
boards
with
the
strip
of
carpet
by
the
bedside
he
knew
nothing
of
all
this
he
was
not
horrified
because
he
knew
that
it
was
all
some
plastic
fantasy
that
happened
to
be
presented
for
the
moment
to
his
brain
even
the
big
black
wooden
chest
that
held
his
books
despised
by
horbury
among
them
failed
to
appeal
to
him
with
any
sense
of
reality
and
the
washstand
and
chest
of
drawers
the
white
with
the
blue
band
were
all
frankly
phantasmal
it
reminded
him
of
a
trick
he
had
sometimes
played
one
chose
one
position
carefully
shut
an
eye
and
behold
a
mean
shed
could
be
made
to
obscure
the
view
of
a
mountain
so
these
walls
and
appurtenances
made
an
illusory
sort
of
intrusion
into
the
true
vision
on
which
he
gazed
that
yellow
washstand
rising
out
of
the
shining
wells
of
the
undying
the
speckled
walls
in
the
place
of
the
great
mysteries
a
chest
of
drawers
in
the
magic
garden
of
roses
it
had
the
air
of
a
queer
joke
and
he
laughed
aloud
to
himself
as
he
realized
that
he
alone
knew
that
everybody
else
would
say
that
is
a
white
jug
with
a
blue
band
while
he
and
he
only
saw
the
marvel
and
glory
of
the
holy
cup
with
its
glowing
metals
its
interlacing
myriad
lines
its
wonderful
images
and
its
hues
of
the
mountain
and
the
stars
of
the
green
wood
and
the
faery
sea
where
in
a
sure
haven
anchor
the
ships
that
are
bound
for
avalon
for
he
had
a
certain
faith
that
he
had
found
the
earthly
presentation
and
sacrament
of
the
eternal
heavenly
mystery
he
smiled
again
with
the
quaint
smile
of
an
angel
in
an
old
italian
picture
as
he
realized
more
fully
the
strangeness
of
the
whole
position
and
the
odd
humours
which
would
relieve
to
play
a
wonderful
game
of
the
speckled
walls
for
instance
were
not
really
there
but
he
was
to
behave
just
as
if
they
were
solid
realities
he
would
presently
rise
and
go
through
an
odd
pantomine
of
washing
and
dressing
putting
on
brilliant
boots
and
going
down
to
various
ceremonies
called
breakfast
chapel
and
dinner
in
the
company
of
appearances
to
whom
he
would
accord
all
the
honours
due
to
veritable
beings
and
this
delicious
phantasmagoria
would
go
on
and
on
day
after
day
he
alone
having
the
secret
and
what
a
delight
it
would
be
to
play
up
at
rocker
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
earth
the
dear
old
school
and
rocker
itself
had
all
been
made
to
minister
to
the
acuteness
of
his
pleasure
they
were
the
darkness
that
made
the
light
visible
the
matter
through
which
form
was
manifested
for
the
moment
he
enclosed
in
the
most
secret
place
of
his
soul
the
true
world
into
which
he
had
been
guided
and
as
he
dressed
he
hummed
the
favourite
school
song
never
mind
if
the
umpire
calls
at
your
poor
second
over
if
none
of
your
hits
ever
turns
out
a
if
you
fumble
your
fives
and
rot
over
sticker
if
every
hound
is
a
little
bit
quicker
if
you

tackle
rocker
at
all
not
at
all
and
kick
at
the
moon
when
you
try
for
the
ball

ambrose
could
not
understand
how
columbus
could
have
blundered
so
grossly
somehow
or
other
he
should
have
contrived
to
rid
himself
of
his
crew
he
should
have
returned
alone
with
a
dismal
tale
of
failure
and
passed
the
rest
of
his
days
as
that
sad
and
sorry
charlatan
who
had
misled
the
world
with
his
mad
whimsies
of
a
continent
beyond
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
if
he
had
been
given
wisdom
to
do
this
how
great
how
wonderful
would
his
joys
have
been
they
would
have
pointed
at
him
as
he
paced
the
streets
in
his
shabby
cloak
the
boys
would
have
sung
songs
about
him
and
his
madness
the
great
people
would
have
laughed
contemptuously
as
he
went
by
and
he
would
have
seen
in
his
heart
all
that
vast
far
world
of
the
west
the
rich
islands
barred
by
roaring
surf
a
whole
hemisphere
of
strange
regions
and
strange
people
he
would
have
known
that
he
alone
possessed
the
secret
of
it
but
after
all
ambrose
knew
that
his
was
a
greater
joy
even
than
this
for
the
world
that
he
had
discovered
was
not
far
across
the
seas
but
within
him
pelly
stared
straight
before
him
in
savage
silence
all
through
breakfast
he
was
convinced
that
mere
hazard
had
guided
that
crushing
blow
and
he
was
meditating
schemes
of
complete
and
exemplary
vengeance
he
noticed
nothing
strange
about
meyrick
nor
would
he
have
cared
if
he
had
seen
the
images
of
the
fairies
in
his
eyes
rawson
on
the
other
hand
was
full
of
genial
civility
and
good
fellowship
it
was
old
chap
and
old
fellow
every
other
word
but
he
was
far
from
unintelligent
and
as
he
slyly
watched
meyrick
he
saw
that
there
was
something
altogether
unaccustomed
and
incomprehensible
unknown
lights
burned
and
shone
in
the
eyes
reflections
of
one
knew
not
what
the
expression
was
altered
in
some
queer
way
that
he
could
not
understand
meyrick
had
always
been
a
rather
ugly
fellow
his
black
hair
and
something
that
was
not
usual
in
the
set
of
his
features
gave
him
an
exotic
almost
an
oriental
appearance
hence
a
story
of
to
the
effect
that
meyrick
mother
was
a
nigger
woman
in
poor
circumstances
and
of
indifferent
morality
had
struck
the
school
as
plausible
enough
but
now
the
grimness
of
the
rugged
features
seemed
abolished
the
face
shone
as
it
were
with
the
light
of
a
flame
but
a
flame
of
what
fire
rawson
who
would
not
have
put
his
observations
into
such
terms
drew
his
own
conclusions
readily
enough
and
imparted
them
to
pelly
after
chapel
look
here
old
chap
he
said
did
you
notice
young
meyrick
at
breakfast
pelly
simply
blasted
meyrick
and
announced
his
intention
of
giving
him
the
worst
thrashing
he
had
ever
had
at
an
early
date
do
you
try
it
on
said
rawson
i
had
my
eye
on
him
all
the
time
he
did
see
i
was
spotting
him
he
cracked
he
dangerous
i
should
wonder
if
he
were
in
a
strait
waistcoat
in
the
county
lunatic
asylum
in
a
week
time
my
governor
had
a
lot
to
do
with
lunatics
and
he
always
says
he
can
tell
by
the
eyes
i
swear
meyrick
is
raging
mad
oh
rot
said
pelly
what
do
you
know
about
it
well
look
out
old
chap
and
do
say
i
did
give
you
the
tip
of
course
you
know
a
maniac
is
stronger
than
three
ordinary
men
the
only
thing
is
to
get
them
down
and
crack
their
ribs
but
you
want
at
least
half
a
dozen
men
before
you
can
do
it
oh
shut
up
so
rawson
said
no
more
remaining
quite
sure
that
he
had
diagnosed
ambrose
symptoms
correctly
he
waited
for
the
catastrophe
with
a
dreadful
joy
wondering
whether
meyrick
would
begin
by
cutting
old
horbury
throat
with
his
own
razor
or
whether
he
would
rather
steal
into
pelly
room
at
night
and
tear
him
limb
from
limb
a
feat
which
as
a
madman
he
could
of
course
accomplish
with
perfect
ease
as
a
matter
of
fact
neither
of
these
events
happened
pelly
a
boy
of
the
bulldog
breed
smacked
ambrose
face
a
day
or
two
later
before
a
huge
crowd
of
boys
and
received
in
return
such
a
terrific
blow
under
the
left
ear
that
a
formal
fight
in
the
tom
brown
manner
was
out
of
the
question
pelly
reached
the
ground
and
stayed
there
in
an
unconscious
state
for
some
while
and
the
other
boys
determined
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
leave
meyrick
to
himself
he
might
be
cracked
but
he
was
undoubtedly
a
hard
hitter
as
for
pelly
like
the
sensible
fellow
that
he
was
he
simply
concluded
that
meyrick
was
too
good
for
him
he
did
not
quite
understand
it
he
dimly
suspected
the
intrusion
of
some
strange
forces
but
with
such
things
he
had
nothing
to
do
it
was
a
fair
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
bates
had
glanced
up
as
ambrose
came
into
the
on
the
sunday
morning
he
saw
the
shining
face
the
rapturous
eyes
and
had
silently
wondered
recognising
the
presence
of
elements
which
transcended
all
his
calculations
meanwhile
the
lupton
sunday
went
on
after
its
customary
fashion
at
eleven
the
chapel
was
full
of
boys
there
were
nearly
six
hundred
of
them
there
the
big
ones
in
with
high
pointed
collars
which
made
them
look
like
youthful
gladstones
the
younger
boys
wore
broad
collars
and
had
short
square
jackets
made
somewhat
in
the
basque
fashion
young
and
old
had
their
hair
cut
close
to
the
scalp
and
this
gave
them
all
a
brisk
but
bullety
appearance
the
masters
in
cassock
gown
and
hood
occupied
the
choir
stalls
horbury
the
high
usher
clothed
in
a
flowing
surplice
was
taking
morning
prayer
and
the
head
occupied
a
kind
of
throne
by
the
altar
the
chapel
was
not
an
inspiring
building
it
was
the
fourteenth
century
certainly
but
the
fourteenth
century
translated
by
and
it
is
to
be
feared
sadly
betrayed
by
the
translators
the
tracery
of
the
windows
was
poor
and
shallow
the
mouldings
of
the
piers
and
arches
faulty
to
a
degree
the
chancel
was
absurdly
out
of
proportion
and
the
benches
and
stalls
had
a
sticky
look
there
was
a
window
in
memory
of
the
old
luptonians
who
fell
in
the
crimea
one
wondered
what
the
woman
of
samaria
by
the
well
had
to
do
either
with
lupton
or
the
crimea
and
the
colouring
was
like
that
used
in
very
common
cheap
sweets
the
service
went
with
a
rush
the
prayers
versicles
and
responses
and
psalms
were
said
the
officiant
and
the
congregation
rather
pressing
than
pausing
often
indeed
coming
so
swiftly
to
cues
that
two
or
three
words
at
the
end
of
one
verse
or
two
or
three
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
would
be
lost
in
a
confused
noise
of
contending
voices
but
and
and
were
rattled
off
to
frisky
anglicans
with
great
spirit
sometimes
the
organ
tooted
sometimes
it
bleated
gently
like
a
flock
of
sheep
now
one
might
have
sworn
that
the
music
of
penny
whistles
stole
on
the
ear
and
again
as
the
organist
coupled
up
the
full
organ
using
suddenly
all
the
battery
of
his
stops
a
gas
explosion
and
a
salvation
army
band
seemed
to
strive
against
one
another
a
nobleman
who
had
been
to
chapel
at
lupton
was
heard
to
say
with
reference
to
this
experience
i
am
no
ritualist
heaven
knows
but
i
confess
i
like
a
hearty
service
but
it
was
above
all
the
sermon
that
has
made
the
chapel
a
place
of
many
memories
the
old
boys
say
and
one
supposes
that
they
are
in
earnest
that
the
tall
dignified
figure
of
the
doctor
standing
high
above
them
all
his
scarlet
hood
making
a
brilliant
splash
of
colour
against
the
dingy
bilious
paint
of
the
pale
green
walls
has
been
an
inspiration
to
them
in
all
quarters
of
the
globe
in
all
manner
of
difficulties
and
temptations
one
man
writes
that
in
the
midst
of
a
complicated
and
dangerous
deal
on
the
stock
exchange
he
remembered
a
sermon
of
chesson
called
in
the
printed
volume
fighting
the
good
fight
you
have
a
phrase
amongst
you
which
i
often
hear
said
the
head
that
phrase
is
the
game
and
i
wish
to
say
that
though
you
know
it
not
though
it
may
be
the
words
are
often
spoken
half
in
jest
still
they
are
but
your
modern
boyish
rendering
of
the
old
stirring
message
which
i
have
just
read
to
you
fight
the
good
fight
the
game
remember
the
words
in
the
storm
and
struggle
the
anxiety
and
stress
that
may
be
nay
must
be
before
you
etc
after
the
crisis
was
over
wrote
the
stock
exchange
man
i
was
thankful
that
i
remembered
those
words
that
voice
sounding
like
a
trumpet
on
the
bidding
us
all
remember
that
success
was
the
prize
of
effort
and
endurance
so
writes
a
journalist
i
remembered
what
the
doctor
said
to
us
once
about
the
race
says
a
young
soldier
recounting
a
narrow
escape
from
a
fierce
enemy
so
i
stuck
to
my
orders
ambrose
on
that
sunday
morning
sat
in
his
place
relishing
acutely
all
the
savours
of
the
scene
consumed
with
inward
mirth
at
the
thought
that
this
also
professed
to
be
a
rite
of
religion
there
was
an
aimless
and
flighty
merriment
about
the
chant
to
the
that
made
it
difficult
for
him
to
control
his
laughter
and
when
he
joined
in
the
hymn
pleasant
are
thy
courts
above
there
was
an
odd
choke
in
his
voice
that
made
the
boy
next
to
him
shuffle
uneasily
but
the
sermon
it
will
be
found
on
page
of
the
it
dealt
with
the
parable
of
the
talents
and
showed
the
boys
in
what
the
sin
of
the
man
who
concealed
his
talent
really
consisted
i
daresay
said
the
head
that
many
of
the
older
amongst
you
have
wondered
what
this
man
sin
really
was
you
may
have
read
your
greek
testaments
carefully
and
then
have
tried
to
form
in
your
minds
some
analogy
to
the
circumstances
of
the
parable
and
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
you
were
to
tell
me
that
you
had
failed
what
manner
of
man
was
this
i
can
imagine
your
saying
one
to
another
i
shall
not
be
astonished
if
you
confess
that
for
you
at
least
the
question
seems
unanswerable
yes
unanswerable
to
you
for
you
are
english
boys
the
sons
of
english
gentlemen
to
whom
the
atmosphere
of
casuistry
of
concealment
of
subtlety
is
unknown
by
whom
such
an
atmosphere
would
be
rejected
with
scorn
you
come
from
homes
where
there
is
no
shadow
no
dark
corner
which
must
not
be
pried
into
your
relations
and
your
friends
are
not
of
those
who
hide
their
gifts
from
the
light
of
day
some
of
you
perhaps
have
had
the
privilege
of
listening
to
the
talk
of
one
or
other
of
the
great
statesmen
who
guide
the
doctrines
of
this
vast
empire
you
will
have
observed
i
am
sure
that
in
the
world
of
politics
there
is
no
vain
simulation
of
modesty
no
feigned
reluctance
to
speak
of
worthy
achievement
all
of
you
are
members
of
this
great
community
of
which
each
one
of
us
is
so
proud
which
we
think
of
as
the
great
inspiration
and
motive
force
of
our
lives
here
you
will
say
there
are
no
hidden
talents
for
the
note
of
the
english
public
school
thank
god
for
it
is
openness
frankness
healthy
emulation
each
endeavouring
to
do
his
best
for
the
good
of
all
in
our
studies
and
in
our
games
each
desires
to
excel
to
carry
off
the
prize
we
strive
for
a
corruptible
crown
thinking
that
this
after
all
is
the
surest
discipline
for
the
crown
that
is
incorruptible
if
a
man
say
that
he
loveth
god
whom
he
hath
not
seen
and
love
not
his
brother
whom
he
hath
seen
let
your
light
before
men
be
sure
that
we
shall
never
win
heaven
by
despising
earth
yet
that
man
hid
his
talent
in
a
napkin
what
does
the
story
mean
what
message
has
it
for
us
i
will
tell
you
some
years
ago
during
our
summer
holidays
i
was
on
a
walking
tour
in
a
mountainous
district
in
the
north
of
england
the
sky
was
of
a
most
brilliant
blue
the
sun
poured
as
it
were
a
gospel
of
gladness
on
the
earth
towards
the
close
of
the
day
i
was
entering
a
peaceful
and
beautiful
valley
amongst
the
hills
when
three
sullen
notes
of
a
bell
came
down
the
breeze
towards
me
there
was
a
pause
again
the
three
strokes
and
for
a
third
time
this
dismal
summons
struck
my
ears
i
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
wondering
whence
it
came
and
what
it
signified
and
soon
i
saw
before
me
a
great
pile
of
buildings
surrounded
by
a
gloomy
and
lofty
wall
it
was
a
roman
catholic
monastery
the
bell
was
ringing
the
angelus
as
it
is
called
i
obtained
admittance
to
this
place
and
spoke
to
some
of
the
unhappy
monks
i
should
astonish
you
if
i
mentioned
the
names
of
some
of
the
deluded
men
who
had
immured
themselves
in
this
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
among
them
were
a
soldier
who
had
won
distinction
on
the
an
artist
a
statesman
and
a
physician
of
no
mean
repute
now
do
you
understand
ah
a
day
will
come
you
know
i
think
what
that
day
is
called
when
these
poor
men
will
have
to
answer
the
question
is
the
talent
that
was
given
to
you
was
your
sword
in
the
hour
of
your
country
danger
was
your
picture
your
consecration
of
your
art
to
the
service
of
morality
and
humanity
when
the
doors
of
the
great
exhibition
were
thrown
open
was
your
silver
eloquence
your
voice
of
persuasion
when
the
strife
of
party
was
at
its
fiercest
was
your
skill
in
healing
when
one
of
royal
blood
lay
fainting
on
the
bed
of
dire
almost
mortal
sickness
and
the
answer
laid
it
up
in
a
napkin
and
now
etc
then
the
whole
six
hundred
boys
sang
o
paradise
o
paradise
with
a
fervour
and
sincerity
that
were
irresistible
the
organ
thundered
till
the
bad
glass
shivered
and
rattled
and
the
service
was
over
v
almost
the
last
words
that
ambrose
had
heard
after
his
wonderful
awaking
were
odd
enough
though
at
the
time
he
took
little
note
of
them
since
they
were
uttered
amidst
passionate
embraces
amidst
soft
kisses
on
his
poor
beaten
flesh
indeed
if
these
words
recurred
to
him
afterwards
they
never
made
much
impression
on
his
mind
though
to
most
people
they
would
seem
of
more
serious
import
than
much
else
that
was
uttered
that
night
the
sentences
ran
something
like
this
the
cruel
wicked
brute
he
shall
be
sorry
all
his
days
and
every
blow
shall
be
a
grief
to
him
my
dear
i
promise
you
he
shall
pay
for
ten
times
over
his
heart
shall
ache
for
it
till
it
stops
beating
there
can
not
be
much
doubt
that
this
promise
was
kept
to
the
letter
no
one
knew
how
wicked
rumours
concerning
horbury
got
abroad
in
lupton
but
from
that
very
day
the
execution
of
the
sentence
began
in
the
evening
the
high
usher
paying
a
visit
to
a
friend
in
town
took
a
short
cut
through
certain
dark
streets
and
was
suddenly
horrified
to
hear
his
name
shrieked
out
coupled
with
a
most
disgusting
accusation
his
heart
sank
down
in
his
breast
his
face
he
knew
was
bloodless
and
then
he
rushed
forward
to
the
malpassage
whence
the
voice
seemed
to
proceed
there
was
nothing
there
it
was
a
horrid
little
alley
leading
from
one
slum
to
another
between
low
walls
and
waste
dismal
and
lampless
horbury
ran
at
top
speed
to
the
end
of
it
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
a
few
women
were
gossiping
at
their
doors
a
couple
of
men
slouched
past
on
their
way
to
the
at
the
corner
that
was
all
he
asked
one
of
the
women
if
she
had
seen
anybody
running
and
she
said
no
civilly
enough
and
yet
he
fancied
that
she
had
leered
at
him
he
turned
and
went
back
home
he
was
not
in
the
mood
for
paying
visits
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
compose
his
mind
by
assuring
himself
that
the
incident
though
unpleasant
was
not
of
the
slightest
significance
but
from
that
day
the
nets
were
about
his
feet
and
his
fate
was
sealed
personally
he
was
subjected
to
no
further
annoyance
and
soon
forgot
that
unpleasant
experience
in
the
but
it
seems
certain
that
from
that
sunday
onwards
a
cloud
of
calumny
overshadowed
the
high
usher
in
all
his
ways
no
one
said
anything
definite
but
everyone
appeared
to
be
conscious
of
something
unpleasant
when
horbury
name
was
mentioned
people
looked
oddly
at
one
another
and
the
subject
was
changed
one
of
the
young
masters
speaking
to
a
colleague
did
indeed
allude
casually
to
horbury
as
xanthias
phoceus
the
other
master
a
man
raised
his
eyebrows
and
shook
his
head
without
speaking
it
is
understood
that
these
muttered
slanders
were
various
in
their
nature
but
as
has
been
said
everything
was
indefinite
intangible
as
contagion
and
as
deadly
to
the
master
worldly
health
that
horrible
accusation
which
had
been
screamed
out
of
the
alley
was
credited
by
some
others
agreed
with
the
young
master
while
a
few
had
a
terrible
story
of
an
idiot
girl
in
a
remote
derbyshire
village
and
the
persistence
of
all
these
fables
was
strange
it
was
four
years
before
henry
vibart
chesson
ascended
the
throne
of
guthmund
at
dorchester
and
all
through
those
four
years
the
fountain
of
evil
innuendo
rose
without
ceasing
it
is
doubtful
how
far
belief
in
the
truth
of
these
scandals
was
firm
and
settled
or
how
far
they
were
in
the
main
uttered
and
circulated
by
people
who
disliked
horbury
but
did
not
in
their
hearts
believe
him
guilty
of
worse
sins
than
pompousness
and
arrogance
the
latter
is
the
more
probable
opinion
of
course
the
deliberations
of
the
trustees
were
absolutely
secret
and
the
report
that
the
chairman
the
marquis
of
dunham
said
something
about
c√¶sar
wife
is
a
report
and
nothing
more
it
is
evident
that
the
london
press
was
absolutely
in
the
dark
as
to
the
existence
of
this
strange
conspiracy
of
vengeance
since
two
of
the
chief
dailies
took
the
appointment
of
the
high
usher
to
the
headmastership
as
a
foregone
conclusion
prophesying
indeed
a
rule
of
phenomenal
success
and
then
millward
a
winchester
man
understood
to
be
rather
unsound
on
some
scholastic
matters
not
the
right
man
just
a
bit
of
a
jesuit
received
the
appointment
and
people
did
begin
to
say
that
there
must
be
a
screw
loose
somewhere
and
horbury
was
overwhelmed
and
began
to
die
the
odd
thing
was
that
save
on
that
sunday
night
he
never
saw
the
enemy
he
never
suspected
that
there
was
an
enemy
and
as
for
the
incident
of
the
alley
after
a
little
consideration
he
treated
it
with
contempt
it
was
only
some
drunken
beast
in
the
town
who
knew
him
by
sight
and
wished
to
be
offensive
in
the
usual
fashion
of
drunken
beasts
and
there
was
nothing
else
lupton
society
was
much
too
careful
to
allow
its
suspicions
to
be
known
a
libel
action
meant
anyhow
a
hideous
scandal
and
might
have
no
pleasant
results
for
the
libellers
besides
no
one
wanted
to
offend
horbury
who
was
suspected
of
possessing
a
revengeful
temper
and
it
had
not
dawned
on
the
lupton
mind
that
the
rumours
they
themselves
were
circulating
would
eventually
ruin
the
high
usher
chances
of
the
headmastership
each
gossip
heard
as
it
were
only
his
own
mutter
at
the
moment
he
did
not
realize
that
when
a
great
many
people
are
muttering
all
at
once
an
ugly
noise
of
considerable
volume
is
being
produced
it
is
true
that
a
few
of
the
masters
were
somewhat
cold
in
their
manner
they
lacked
the
social
gift
of
dissimulation
and
could
not
help
showing
their
want
of
cordiality
but
horbury
who
noticed
this
put
it
down
to
envy
and
disaffection
and
resolved
that
the
large
powers
given
him
by
the
trustees
should
not
be
in
vain
so
far
as
the
masters
in
question
were
concerned
indeed
wood
who
was
afterwards
headmaster
of
marcester
and
died
in
egypt
a
few
years
ago
had
a
curious
story
which
in
part
relates
to
the
masters
in
question
and
perhaps
throws
some
light
on
the
extraordinary
tale
of
horbury
ruin
wood
was
an
old
luptonian
he
was
a
mighty
athlete
in
his
time
and
his
records
for
the
long
jump
and
throwing
the
cricket
ball
have
not
been
beaten
at
lupton
to
this
day
he
had
been
one
of
the
first
boarders
taken
at
the
old
grange
the
early
relations
between
horbury
and
himself
had
been
continued
in
later
life
and
wood
was
staying
with
his
former
master
at
the
time
when
the
trustee
decision
was
announced
it
is
supposed
indeed
that
horbury
had
offered
him
a
kind
of
unofficial
but
still
important
position
in
the
new
model
in
fact
wood
confessed
over
his
port
that
the
idea
was
that
he
should
be
a
kind
of
intelligence
department
to
the
head
he
did
not
seem
very
clear
as
to
the
exact
scope
of
his
proposed
duties
we
may
certainly
infer
however
that
they
would
have
been
of
a
very
confidential
nature
for
wood
had
jotted
down
his
recollections
of
that
fatal
morning
somewhat
as
follows
i
never
saw
horbury
in
better
spirits
indeed
i
remember
thinking
that
he
was
younger
than
ever
younger
than
he
was
in
the
old
days
when
he
was
a
junior
master
and
i
was
in
the
third
of
course
he
was
always
energetic
one
could
not
disassociate
the
two
notions
of
horbury
and
energy
and
i
used
to
make
him
laugh
by
threatening
to
include
the
two
terms
in
the
new
edition
of
my
little
book
and
english
it
did
not
matter
whether
he
were
taking
the
fifth
or
editing
classics
for
his
boys
or
playing
rocker
one
could
not
help
rejoicing
in
the
vivid
and
ebullient
energy
of
the
man
and
perhaps
this
is
one
reason
why
shirkers
and
loafers
dreaded
him
as
they
certainly
did
but
during
those
last
few
days
at
lupton
his
vitality
had
struck
me
as
quite
superhuman
as
all
the
world
knows
his
succession
to
the
headmastership
was
regarded
by
everyone
as
assured
and
he
was
naturally
and
properly
full
of
the
great
task
which
he
believed
was
before
him
this
is
not
the
place
to
argue
the
merits
or
demerits
of
the
scheme
which
had
been
maturing
for
many
years
in
his
brain
a
few
persons
who
i
can
not
but
think
have
received
very
imperfect
information
on
the
subject
have
denounced
horbury
views
of
the
modern
public
school
as
revolutionary
revolutionary
they
certainly
were
as
an
express
engine
is
revolutionary
compared
to
an
but
those
who
think
of
the
late
canon
horbury
as
indifferent
to
the
good
side
of
public
school
traditions
knew
little
of
the
real
man
however
were
his
plans
good
or
bad
they
were
certainly
of
vast
scope
and
on
the
first
night
of
my
visit
he
made
me
sit
up
with
him
till
two
while
he
expounded
his
ideas
some
of
which
as
he
was
good
enough
to
say
he
trusted
to
me
to
carry
out
he
showed
me
the
piles
of
he
had
accumulated
hundreds
of
pages
relating
to
the
multiple
departments
of
the
great
organisation
which
he
was
to
direct
or
rather
to
create
sheets
of
serried
figures
sheaves
of
estimates
which
he
had
caused
to
be
made
out
in
readiness
for
immediate
action
nothing
was
neglected
i
remember
seeing
a
note
on
the
desirability
of
compiling
a
hymn
book
for
use
in
the
chapel
and
another
on
the
question
of
forming
a
botanical
garden
so
that
the
school
botany
might
be
learned
from
green
life
as
he
beautifully
expressed
it
not
from
dry
letterpress
and
indifferent
woodcuts
then
i
think
on
a
corner
of
the
leaf
was
a
jotting
a
mere
hasty
scrawl
waiting
development
and
consideration
we
teach
hindustani
write
to
tucker
the
moulvie
ahmed
khan
i
despair
of
giving
the
reader
any
conception
of
the
range
and
minuteness
of
these
wonderful
memoranda
i
remember
saying
to
horbury
that
he
seemed
to
be
able
to
use
the
microscope
and
the
telescope
at
the
same
time
he
laughed
joyously
and
told
me
to
wait
till
he
was
really
at
work
will
have
your
share
i
promise
you
he
added
his
high
spirits
were
extraordinary
and
infectious
he
was
an
excellent
and
now
and
again
amidst
his
talk
of
the
new
lupton
which
he
was
about
to
translate
from
the
idea
into
substance
he
told
some
wonderful
stories
which
i
have
not
the
heart
to
set
down
here
ne
i
have
often
thought
of
those
lines
when
i
remember
horbury
intense
happiness
the
nervous
energy
which
made
the
delay
of
a
day
or
two
seem
almost
intolerable
his
brain
and
his
fingers
tingled
as
it
were
to
set
about
the
great
work
before
him
he
reminded
me
of
a
mighty
host
awaiting
but
the
glance
of
their
general
to
rush
forward
with
irresistible
force
there
was
not
a
trace
of
misgiving
indeed
i
should
have
been
utterly
astonished
if
i
had
seen
anything
of
the
kind
he
told
me
indeed
that
for
some
time
past
he
had
suspected
the
existence
of
a
sort
of
cabal
or
clique
against
him
and
and
and
and
i
think
are
in
it
he
said
naming
several
of
the
masters
are
jealous
i
suppose
and
want
to
make
things
as
difficult
as
they
can
they
are
all
cowards
though
and
i
do
believe
one
of
them
except
perhaps
would
fail
in
obedience
or
rather
in
subservience
when
it
comes
to
the
point
but
i
am
going
to
make
short
work
of
the
lot
and
he
told
me
his
intention
of
ridding
the
school
of
these
disaffected
elements
trustees
will
back
me
up
i
know
he
added
we
must
try
to
avoid
all
unnecessary
friction
and
he
explained
to
me
a
plan
he
had
thought
of
for
eliminating
the
masters
in
question
wo
do
to
have
officers
on
our
ship
was
the
way
in
which
he
put
it
and
i
cordially
agreed
with
him
possibly
he
may
have
underrated
the
force
of
the
opposition
which
he
treated
so
lightly
possibly
he
altogether
misjudged
the
situation
he
certainly
regarded
the
appointment
as
already
made
and
this
of
course
was
or
appeared
to
be
the
conviction
of
all
who
knew
anything
of
lupton
and
horbury
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
on
which
the
news
came
horbury
made
a
hearty
breakfast
opening
letters
jotting
down
notes
talking
of
his
plans
as
the
meal
proceeded
i
left
him
for
a
while
i
was
myself
a
good
deal
excited
and
i
strolled
up
and
down
the
beautiful
garden
at
the
old
grange
wondering
whether
i
should
be
able
to
satisfy
such
a
chief
who
the
soul
of
energy
himself
would
naturally
expect
a
like
quality
in
his
subordinates
i
rejoined
him
in
the
course
of
an
hour
in
the
study
where
he
was
as
busy
as
ever
up
as
he
expressed
it
in
a
vast
pile
of
papers
and
correspondence
he
nodded
genially
and
pointed
to
a
chair
and
a
few
minutes
later
a
servant
came
in
with
a
letter
she
had
just
found
it
in
the
hall
she
explained
i
had
taken
a
book
and
was
reading
i
noticed
nothing
till
what
i
can
only
call
a
groan
of
intense
anguish
made
me
look
up
in
amazement
indeed
in
horror
and
i
was
shocked
to
see
my
old
friend
his
face
a
ghastly
white
his
eyes
staring
into
vacancy
and
his
expression
one
of
the
most
terrible
most
terrible
that
i
have
ever
witnessed
i
can
not
describe
that
look
there
was
an
agony
of
grief
and
despair
a
glance
of
the
wildest
amazement
terror
as
of
an
impending
awful
death
and
with
these
the
fiercest
and
most
burning
anger
that
i
have
ever
seen
on
any
human
face
he
held
a
letter
clenched
in
his
hand
i
was
afraid
to
speak
or
move
it
was
fully
five
minutes
before
he
regained
his
and
he
did
this
with
an
effort
which
was
in
itself
dreadful
to
contemplate
so
severe
was
the
struggle
he
explained
to
me
in
a
voice
which
faltered
and
trembled
with
the
shock
that
he
had
received
that
he
had
had
very
bad
news
that
a
large
sum
of
money
which
was
absolutely
necessary
to
the
carrying
out
of
his
projects
had
been
embezzled
by
some
unscrupulous
person
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
should
do
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
become
an
old
man
he
did
not
seem
upset
or
even
astonished
when
later
in
the
day
a
telegram
announced
that
he
had
failed
in
the
aim
of
his
life
that
a
stranger
was
to
bear
rule
in
his
beloved
lupton
he
murmured
something
to
the
effect
that
it
was
no
matter
now
he
never
held
up
his
head
again
this
note
is
an
extract
from
horbury
a
it
was
written
by
wood
for
the
use
of
a
few
friends
and
privately
printed
in
a
small
edition
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
copies
the
author
felt
as
he
explains
in
his
brief
that
by
restricting
the
sale
to
those
who
either
knew
horbury
or
were
especially
interested
in
his
work
he
was
enabled
to
dwell
somewhat
intimately
on
matters
which
could
hardly
have
been
treated
in
a
book
meant
for
the
general
public
the
extract
that
has
been
made
from
this
book
is
interesting
on
two
points
it
shows
that
horbury
was
quite
unaware
of
what
had
been
going
on
for
four
years
before
chesson
resignation
and
that
he
had
entirely
misinterpreted
the
few
and
faint
omens
which
had
been
offered
him
he
was
preparing
to
break
a
sulky
sentinel
or
two
when
all
the
ground
of
his
fortalice
was
a
very
network
of
loaded
mines
the
other
point
is
still
more
curious
it
will
be
seen
from
wood
story
that
the
terrific
effect
that
he
describes
was
produced
by
a
letter
received
some
hours
before
the
news
of
the
trustees
decision
arrived
by
telegram
later
in
the
day
is
the
phrase
in
the
memoir
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
final
deliberation
of
the
lupton
trustees
held
at
marshall
hotel
in
albemarle
street
began
at
and
was
not
over
till
it
is
not
likely
that
the
result
could
have
reached
the
old
grange
before
whereas
the
letter
found
in
the
hall
must
have
been
read
by
horbury
before
ten
the
invariable
breakfast
hour
at
the
old
grange
was
eight
wood
says
i
rejoined
him
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
the
letter
was
brought
in
a
few
minutes
later
afterwards
when
the
fatal
telegram
arrived
the
memoir
notes
that
the
unfortunate
man
was
not
even
astonished
it
seems
to
follow
almost
necessarily
from
these
facts
that
horbury
learnt
the
story
of
his
ruin
from
the
letter
for
it
has
been
ascertained
that
the
high
usher
account
of
the
contents
of
the
letter
was
false
from
beginning
to
end
horbury
most
excellent
and
sagacious
investments
were
all
in
the
impeccable
hands
of
witham
witham
venables
davenport
and
witham
of
raymond
buildings
gray
inn
who
do
not
include
embezzlement
in
their
theory
and
practice
of
the
law
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
nephew
charles
horbury
came
into
a
very
handsome
fortune
on
the
death
of
his
uncle
eighty
thousand
pounds
in
personality
with
the
old
grange
and
some
valuable
ground
rents
in
the
new
part
of
lupton
it
is
as
certain
as
anything
can
be
that
george
horbury
never
lost
a
penny
by
embezzlement
or
indeed
in
any
other
way
one
may
surmise
then
the
real
contents
of
that
terrible
letter
in
general
that
is
for
it
is
impossible
to
conjecture
whether
the
writer
told
the
whole
story
one
does
not
know
for
example
whether
name
was
mentioned
or
not
whether
there
was
anything
which
carried
the
reader
mind
to
that
dark
evening
in
november
when
he
beat
the
boy
with
such
savage
cruelty
but
from
description
of
the
wretched
man
appearance
one
understands
how
utterly
unexpected
was
the
crushing
blow
that
had
fallen
upon
him
it
was
a
lightning
flash
from
the
sky
at
its
bluest
and
before
that
sudden
and
awful
blast
his
whole
life
fell
into
deadly
and
evil
ruin
he
never
held
up
his
head
again
he
never
lived
again
one
may
say
unless
a
ceaseless
wheel
of
anguish
and
anger
and
bitter
and
unavailing
and
furious
regret
can
be
called
life
it
was
not
a
man
but
a
shell
full
of
gall
and
fire
that
went
to
wareham
but
probably
he
was
not
the
first
of
the
klippoth
to
be
made
a
canon
as
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
exactly
what
or
how
much
that
letter
told
him
one
is
not
in
a
position
to
say
whether
he
recognised
the
singularity
one
might
almost
say
the
eccentricity
with
which
his
punishment
was
deus
certainly
but
a
principle
may
be
pushed
too
far
and
a
critic
might
point
out
that
putting
avenging
deities
in
their
machines
on
one
side
it
was
rather
going
to
the
other
extreme
to
bring
about
the
great
catastrophe
by
means
of
bad
sherry
a
trying
headmaster
boiled
mutton
a
troublesome
schoolboy
and
a
yet
these
were
the
agents
employed
and
it
seems
that
we
are
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
we
do
not
altogether
understand
the
management
of
the
universe
the
conclusion
is
a
dangerous
one
since
we
may
be
led
by
it
unless
great
care
is
exercised
into
the
worst
errors
of
the
dark
ages
there
is
the
question
of
course
of
the
truthfulness
or
falsity
of
the
various
slanders
which
had
such
a
tremendous
effect
the
worst
of
them
were
lies
there
can
be
little
doubt
of
that
and
for
the
rest
it
may
be
hinted
that
the
allusion
of
the
young
master
to
xanthias
phoceus
was
not
very
far
wide
of
the
mark
horbury
had
been
dead
some
years
and
it
is
to
be
feared
that
there
had
been
passages
between
the
high
usher
and
nelly
foran
which
public
opinion
would
have
condemned
it
would
be
difficult
to
tell
the
whole
story
but
the
girl
fury
of
revenge
makes
one
apt
to
believe
that
she
was
exacting
payment
not
only
for
ambrose
wrongs
but
for
some
grievous
injury
done
to
herself
but
before
all
these
things
could
be
brought
to
their
ending
ambrose
meyrick
had
to
live
in
wonders
and
delights
to
be
initiated
in
many
mysteries
to
discover
the
meaning
of
that
voice
which
seemed
to
speak
within
him
denouncing
him
because
he
had
pried
unworthily
into
the
secret
which
is
hidden
from
the
holy
angels
iii
i
one
of
ambrose
meyrick
favourite
books
was
a
railway
timetable
he
spent
many
hours
in
studying
these
intricate
pages
of
figures
noting
times
of
arrival
and
departure
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
following
the
turnings
and
intersections
of
certain
lines
on
the
map
in
this
way
he
had
at
last
arrived
at
the
best
and
quickest
route
to
his
native
country
which
he
had
not
seen
for
five
years
his
father
had
died
when
he
was
ten
years
old
this
result
once
obtained
the
to
birmingham
got
him
in
at
the
for
the
west
was
a
capital
train
and
he
would
see
the
great
dome
of
mynydd
mawr
before
one
his
fancy
led
him
often
to
a
bridge
which
crossed
the
railway
about
a
mile
out
of
lupton
east
and
west
the
metals
stretched
in
a
straight
line
defying
it
seemed
the
wisdom
of
euclid
he
turned
from
the
east
and
gazed
westward
and
when
a
red
train
went
by
in
the
right
direction
he
would
lean
over
the
bridge
and
watch
till
the
last
flying
carriage
had
vanished
into
the
distance
he
imagined
himself
in
that
train
and
thought
of
the
joy
of
it
if
the
time
ever
came
for
it
seemed
long
the
joy
in
every
revolution
of
the
wheels
in
every
whistle
of
the
engine
in
the
rush
and
in
the
rhythm
of
this
swift
flight
from
that
horrible
school
and
that
horrible
place
year
after
year
went
by
and
he
had
not
revisited
the
old
land
of
his
father
he
was
left
alone
in
the
great
empty
house
in
charge
of
the
servants
during
the
holidays
except
one
summer
when
horbury
despatched
him
to
a
cousin
of
his
who
lived
at
yarmouth
the
second
year
after
his
father
death
there
was
a
summer
of
dreadful
heat
day
after
day
the
sky
was
a
glare
of
fire
and
in
these
abhorred
midlands
far
from
the
breath
of
the
sea
and
the
mountain
breeze
the
ground
baked
and
cracked
and
stank
to
heaven
a
dun
smoke
rose
from
the
earth
with
the
faint
sickening
stench
of
a
and
the
hedgerows
swooned
in
the
heat
and
in
the
dust
ambrose
body
and
soul
were
athirst
with
the
desire
of
the
hills
and
the
woods
his
heart
cried
out
within
him
for
the
waterpools
in
the
shadow
of
the
forest
and
in
his
ears
continually
he
heard
the
cold
water
pouring
and
trickling
and
dripping
from
the
grey
rocks
on
the
great
mountain
side
and
he
saw
that
awful
land
which
god
has
no
doubt
made
for
manufacturers
to
prepare
them
for
their
eternal
habitation
its
weary
waves
burning
under
the
glaring
sky
the
factory
chimneys
of
lupton
vomiting
their
foul
smoke
the
mean
red
streets
each
little
hellway
with
its
own
stink
the
dull
road
choking
in
its
dust
for
streams
there
was
the
wand
running
like
black
oil
between
black
banks
steaming
here
as
boiling
poisons
were
belched
into
it
from
the
factory
wall
there
glittering
with
iridescent
scum
vomited
from
some
other
scoundrel
castle
and
for
the
waterpools
of
the
woods
he
was
free
to
gaze
at
the
dark
green
liquor
in
the
tanks
of
the
sulphuric
acid
factory
but
a
little
way
out
of
town
lupton
was
a
very
rising
place
his
body
was
faint
with
the
burning
heat
and
the
foulness
of
all
about
him
and
his
soul
was
sick
with
loneliness
and
friendlessness
and
unutterable
longing
he
had
already
mastered
his
bradshaw
and
had
found
out
the
bridge
over
the
railway
and
day
after
day
he
leaned
over
the
parapet
and
watched
the
burning
metals
vanishing
into
the
west
into
the
hot
thick
haze
that
hung
over
all
the
land
and
the
trains
sped
away
towards
the
haven
of
his
desire
and
he
wondered
if
he
should
ever
see
again
the
dearly
loved
country
or
hear
the
song
of
the
nightingale
in
the
still
white
morning
in
the
circle
of
the
green
hills
the
thought
of
his
father
of
the
old
days
of
happiness
of
the
grey
home
in
the
still
valley
swelled
in
his
heart
and
he
wept
bitterly
so
utterly
forsaken
and
wretched
seemed
his
life
it
happened
towards
the
end
of
that
dreadful
august
that
one
night
he
had
tossed
all
through
the
hours
listening
to
the
chiming
bells
only
falling
into
a
fevered
doze
a
little
while
before
they
called
him
he
woke
from
ugly
and
oppressive
dreams
to
utter
wretchedness
he
crawled
downstairs
like
an
old
man
and
left
his
breakfast
untouched
for
he
could
eat
nothing
the
flame
of
the
sun
seemed
to
burn
in
his
brain
the
hot
smoke
of
the
air
choked
him
all
his
limbs
ached
from
head
to
foot
he
was
a
body
of
suffering
he
struggled
out
and
tottered
along
the
road
to
the
bridge
and
gazed
with
dim
hopeless
eyes
along
the
path
of
desire
into
the
heavy
burning
mist
in
the
far
distance
and
then
his
heart
beat
quick
and
he
cried
aloud
in
his
amazed
delight
for
in
the
shimmering
glamour
of
the
haze
he
saw
as
in
a
mirror
the
vast
green
wall
of
the
great
mountain
rise
before
him
not
far
but
as
if
close
at
hand
nay
he
stood
upon
its
slope
his
feet
were
in
the
bracken
the
hazel
thicket
was
rustling
beneath
him
in
the
brave
wind
and
the
shining
water
poured
cold
from
the
stony
rock
he
heard
the
silver
note
of
the
lark
shrilling
high
and
glad
in
the
sunlight
he
saw
the
yellow
blossoms
tossed
by
the
breeze
about
the
porch
of
the
white
house
he
seemed
to
turn
in
this
vision
and
before
him
the
dear
land
appeared
in
its
great
peace
and
beauty
meadows
and
cornfield
hill
and
valley
and
deep
wood
between
the
mountains
and
the
far
sea
he
drew
a
long
breath
of
that
quickening
and
glorious
air
and
knew
that
life
had
returned
to
him
and
then
he
was
gazing
once
more
down
the
glittering
railway
into
the
mist
but
strength
and
hope
had
replaced
that
deadly
sickness
of
a
moment
before
and
light
and
joy
came
back
to
his
eyes
the
vision
had
doubtless
been
given
to
him
in
his
sore
and
pressing
need
it
returned
no
more
not
again
did
he
see
the
fair
height
of
mynydd
mawr
rise
out
of
the
mist
but
from
that
day
the
station
on
the
bridge
was
daily
consecrated
it
was
his
place
of
refreshment
and
hope
in
many
seasons
of
evil
and
weariness
from
this
place
he
could
look
forward
to
the
hour
of
release
and
return
that
must
come
at
last
here
he
could
remind
himself
that
the
bonds
of
the
flesh
had
been
broken
in
a
wonderful
manner
that
he
had
been
set
free
from
the
jaws
of
hell
and
death
fortunately
few
people
came
that
way
it
was
but
a
serving
a
few
farms
in
the
neighbourhood
and
on
the
sunday
afternoon
in
november
the
head
sermon
over
and
dinner
eaten
he
betook
himself
to
his
tower
free
to
be
alone
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
least
he
stood
there
leaning
on
the
wall
his
face
turned
as
ever
to
the
west
and
as
it
were
a
great
flood
of
rapture
overwhelmed
him
he
sank
down
deeper
still
deeper
into
the
hidden
and
marvellous
places
of
delight
in
his
country
there
were
stories
of
the
magic
people
who
rose
all
gleaming
from
the
pools
in
lonely
woods
who
gave
more
than
mortal
bliss
to
those
who
loved
them
who
could
tell
the
secrets
of
that
land
where
flame
was
the
most
material
substance
whose
inhabitants
dwelt
in
palpitating
and
quivering
colours
or
in
the
notes
of
a
wonderful
melody
and
in
the
dark
of
the
night
all
legends
had
been
fulfilled
it
was
a
strange
thing
but
ambrose
meyrick
though
he
was
a
public
schoolboy
of
fifteen
had
lived
all
his
days
in
a
rapt
innocence
it
is
possible
that
in
school
as
elsewhere
enlightenment
pleasant
or
unpleasant
only
comes
to
those
who
seek
for
it
or
one
may
say
certainly
that
there
are
those
who
dwell
under
the
protection
of
enchantments
who
may
go
down
into
the
black
depths
and
yet
appear
resurgent
and
shining
without
any
stain
or
defilement
of
the
pitch
on
their
white
robes
for
these
have
ears
so
intent
on
certain
immortal
songs
that
they
can
not
hear
discordant
voices
their
eyes
are
veiled
with
a
light
that
shuts
out
the
vision
of
evil
there
are
flames
about
these
feet
that
extinguish
the
gross
fires
of
the
pit
it
is
probable
that
all
through
those
early
years
ambrose
father
had
been
charming
his
son
heart
drawing
him
forth
from
the
of
this
life
into
which
he
had
fallen
as
one
draws
forth
a
beast
that
has
fallen
into
some
deep
and
dreadful
place
various
are
the
methods
recommended
there
is
the
way
of
what
is
called
moral
teaching
the
way
of
physiology
and
the
way
of
a
masterly
silence
but
meyrick
was
the
strange
way
of
incantation
he
had
in
a
certain
manner
drawn
the
boy
aside
from
that
evil
traffic
of
the
valley
from
the
stench
of
the
turmoil
from
the
blows
and
the
black
lechery
from
the
ugly
fight
in
the
poisonous
smoke
from
all
the
amazing
and
hideous
folly
that
practical
men
call
life
and
had
set
him
in
that
endless
procession
that
for
ever
and
for
ever
sings
its
litanies
in
the
mountains
going
from
height
to
height
on
its
great
quest
ambrose
soul
had
been
caught
in
the
sweet
thickets
of
the
woods
it
had
been
bathed
in
the
pure
water
of
blessed
fountains
it
had
knelt
before
the
altars
of
the
old
saints
till
all
the
earth
was
become
a
sanctuary
all
life
was
a
rite
and
ceremony
the
end
of
which
was
the
attainment
of
the
mystic
sanctity
the
achieving
of
the
graal
for
this
for
what
else
were
all
things
made
it
was
this
that
the
little
bird
sang
of
in
the
bush
piping
a
few
feeble
plaintive
notes
of
dusky
evenings
as
if
his
tiny
heart
were
sad
that
it
could
utter
nothing
better
than
such
sorry
praises
this
also
celebrated
the
awe
of
the
white
morning
on
the
hills
the
breath
of
the
woods
at
dawn
this
was
figured
in
the
red
ceremony
of
sunset
when
flames
shone
over
the
dome
of
the
great
mountain
and
roses
blossomed
in
the
far
plains
of
the
sky
this
was
the
secret
of
the
dark
places
in
the
heart
of
the
woods
this
the
mystery
of
the
sunlight
on
the
height
and
every
little
flower
every
delicate
fern
and
every
reed
and
rush
was
entrusted
with
the
hidden
declaration
of
this
sacrament
for
this
end
final
and
perfect
rites
had
been
given
to
men
to
execute
and
these
were
all
the
arts
all
the
splendour
of
the
great
cathedral
all
rich
carven
work
and
all
glowing
colours
all
magical
utterance
of
word
and
tones
all
these
things
were
the
witnesses
that
consented
in
the
one
offering
in
the
high
service
of
the
graal
to
this
service
also
together
with
songs
and
burning
torches
and
dyed
garments
and
the
smoke
of
the
bruised
incense
were
brought
the
incense
of
the
bruised
heart
the
magic
torches
of
virtue
hidden
from
the
world
the
red
dalmatics
of
those
whose
souls
had
been
martyred
the
songs
of
triumph
and
exultation
chanted
by
them
that
the
profane
had
crushed
into
the
dust
holy
wells
and
were
fountains
of
tears
so
must
the
mass
be
duly
celebrated
in
when
cadwaladr
returned
when
teilo
agyos
lifted
up
again
the
shining
cup
perhaps
it
was
not
strange
that
a
boy
who
had
listened
to
such
spells
as
these
should
heed
nothing
of
the
foolish
evils
about
him
the
nastiness
of
silly
children
who
for
want
of
wits
were
crushing
the
lilies
into
the
dunghill
he
listened
to
nothing
of
their
ugly
folly
he
heard
it
not
understood
it
not
thought
as
little
of
it
as
of
their
everlasting
chatter
about
brooks
and
quarries
and
and
beaks
from
the
off
and
when
an
unseemly
phrase
did
chance
to
fall
on
his
ear
it
was
of
no
more
import
or
meaning
than
any
or
all
of
the
stupid
jargon
that
went
on
day
after
day
mixing
itself
with
the
other
jargon
about
the
optative
and
the
past
participle
the
oratio
obliqua
and
the
verbs
in
greek
mi
to
him
this
was
all
one
nothingness
and
he
would
not
have
dreamed
of
connecting
anything
of
it
with
the
facts
of
life
as
he
understood
life
hence
it
was
that
for
him
all
that
was
beautiful
and
wonderful
was
a
part
of
sanctity
all
the
glory
of
life
was
for
the
service
of
the
sanctuary
and
when
one
saw
a
lovely
flower
it
was
to
be
strewn
before
the
altar
just
as
the
bee
was
holy
because
by
its
wax
the
gifts
are
illuminated
where
joy
and
delight
and
beauty
were
there
he
knew
by
sure
signs
were
the
parts
of
the
mystery
the
glorious
apparels
of
the
heavenly
vestments
if
anyone
had
told
him
that
the
song
of
the
nightingale
was
an
unclean
thing
he
would
have
stared
in
amazement
as
though
one
had
blasphemed
the
sanctus
to
him
the
red
roses
were
as
holy
as
the
garments
of
the
martyrs
the
white
lilies
were
pure
and
shining
virtues
the
imagery
of
the
of
was
obvious
and
perfect
and
unassailable
for
in
this
world
there
was
nothing
common
nor
unclean
and
even
to
him
the
great
gift
had
been
freely
given
so
he
stood
wrapt
in
his
meditations
and
in
his
ecstasy
by
the
bridge
over
the
midland
line
from
lupton
to
birmingham
behind
him
were
the
abominations
of
lupton
the
chimneys
vomiting
black
smoke
faintly
in
honour
of
the
sabbath
the
red
lines
of
the
workmen
streets
advancing
into
the
ugly
fields
the
fuming
pottery
kilns
the
hideous
height
of
the
boot
factory
and
before
him
stretched
the
unspeakable
scenery
of
the
eastern
midlands
which
seems
made
for
the
habitation
of
english
nonconformists
dull
monotonous
squalid
the
very
hedgerows
cropped
and
trimmed
the
trees
looking
like
rows
of
roundheads
the
farmhouses
as
uninteresting
as
suburban
villas
on
a
field
near
at
hand
a
scientific
farmer
had
recently
applied
an
agreeable
mixture
consisting
of
superphosphate
of
lime
nitrate
of
soda
and
bone
meal
the
stink
was
that
of
a
chemical
works
or
a
texel
cheese
another
field
was
just
being
converted
into
an
orchard
there
were
rows
of
grim
young
apple
trees
planted
at
strictly
mathematical
intervals
from
one
another
and
grisly
little
graves
had
been
dug
between
the
apple
trees
for
the
reception
of
gooseberry
bushes
between
these
rows
the
farmer
hoped
to
grow
potatoes
so
the
ground
had
been
thoroughly
trenched
it
looked
sodden
and
unpleasant
to
the
right
ambrose
could
see
how
the
operations
on
a
wandering
brook
were
progressing
it
had
moved
in
and
out
in
the
most
wasteful
and
absurd
manner
and
on
each
bank
there
had
grown
a
twisted
brake
of
trees
and
bushes
and
rank
water
plants
there
were
wonderful
red
roses
there
in
summer
time
now
all
this
was
being
rectified
in
the
first
place
the
stream
had
been
cut
into
a
straight
channel
with
raw
bare
banks
and
then
the
rose
bushes
the
alders
the
willows
and
the
rest
were
being
grubbed
up
by
the
roots
and
so
much
valuable
land
was
being
redeemed
the
old
barn
which
used
to
be
visible
on
the
left
of
the
line
had
been
pulled
down
for
more
than
a
year
it
had
dated
perhaps
from
the
seventeenth
century
its
had
dipped
and
waved
in
a
pleasant
fashion
and
the
red
tiles
had
the
glow
of
the
sun
in
their
colours
and
the
walls
were
not
lacking
in
ruinous
brace
it
was
a
dilapidated
old
shed
and
a
structure
with
a
corrugated
iron
roof
now
stood
in
its
place
beyond
all
was
the
grey
prison
wall
of
the
horizon
but
ambrose
no
longer
gazed
at
it
with
the
dim
hopeless
eyes
of
old
he
had
a
breviary
among
his
books
and
he
thought
of
the
words
mea
erepta
est
sicut
passer
de
laqueo
and
he
knew
that
in
a
good
season
his
body
would
escape
also
the
exile
would
end
at
last
he
remembered
an
old
tale
which
his
father
was
fond
of
telling
him
the
story
of
eos
amherawdur
the
emperor
nightingale
very
long
ago
the
story
began
the
greatest
and
the
finest
court
in
all
the
realms
of
faery
was
the
court
of
the
emperor
eos
who
was
above
all
the
kings
of
the
tylwydd
t√™g
as
the
emperor
of
rome
is
head
over
all
the
kings
of
the
earth
so
that
even
gwyn
ap
nudd
whom
they
now
call
lord
over
all
the
fair
folk
of
the
isle
of
britain
was
but
the
man
of
eos
and
no
splendour
such
as
his
was
ever
seen
in
all
the
regions
of
enchantment
and
faery
eos
had
his
court
in
a
vast
forest
called
wentwood
in
the
deepest
depths
of
the
between
caerwent
and
caermaen
which
is
also
called
the
city
of
the
legions
though
some
men
say
that
we
should
rather
name
it
the
city
of
the
waterfloods
here
then
was
the
palace
of
eos
built
of
the
finest
stones
after
the
roman
manner
and
within
it
were
the
most
glorious
chambers
that
eye
has
ever
seen
and
there
was
no
end
to
the
number
of
them
for
they
could
not
be
counted
for
the
stones
of
the
palace
being
immortal
they
were
at
the
pleasure
of
the
emperor
if
he
had
willed
all
the
hosts
of
the
world
could
stand
in
his
greatest
hall
and
if
he
had
willed
not
so
much
as
an
ant
could
enter
into
it
since
it
could
not
be
discerned
but
on
common
days
they
spread
the
emperor
banquet
in
nine
great
halls
each
nine
times
larger
than
any
that
are
in
the
lands
of
the
men
of
normandi
and
sir
caw
was
the
seneschal
who
marshalled
the
feast
and
if
you
would
count
those
under
his
command
go
count
the
drops
of
water
that
are
in
the
uske
river
but
if
you
would
learn
the
splendour
of
this
castle
it
is
an
easy
matter
for
eos
hung
the
walls
of
it
with
dawn
and
sunset
he
lit
it
with
the
sun
and
moon
there
was
a
well
in
it
called
ocean
and
nine
churches
of
twisted
boughs
were
set
apart
in
which
eos
might
hear
mass
and
when
his
clerks
sang
before
him
all
the
jewels
rose
shining
out
of
the
earth
and
all
the
stars
bent
shining
down
from
heaven
so
enchanting
was
the
melody
then
was
great
bliss
in
all
the
regions
of
the
fair
folk
but
eos
was
grieved
because
mortal
ears
could
not
hear
nor
comprehend
the
enchantment
of
their
song
what
then
did
he
do
nothing
less
than
this
he
divested
himself
of
all
his
glories
and
of
his
kingdom
and
transformed
himself
into
the
shape
of
a
little
brown
bird
and
went
flying
about
the
woods
desirous
of
teaching
men
the
sweetness
of
the
faery
melody
and
all
the
other
birds
said
this
is
a
contemptible
stranger
the
eagle
found
him
not
even
worthy
to
be
a
prey
the
raven
and
the
magpie
called
him
simpleton
the
pheasant
asked
where
he
had
got
that
ugly
livery
the
lark
wondered
why
he
hid
himself
in
the
darkness
of
the
wood
the
peacock
would
not
suffer
his
name
to
be
uttered
in
short
never
was
anyone
so
despised
as
was
eos
by
all
the
chorus
of
the
birds
but
wise
men
heard
that
song
from
the
faery
regions
and
listened
all
night
beneath
the
bough
and
these
were
the
first
who
were
bards
in
the
isle
of
britain
ambrose
had
heard
the
song
from
the
faery
regions
he
had
heard
it
in
swift
whispers
at
his
ear
in
sighs
upon
his
breast
in
the
breath
of
kisses
on
his
lips
never
was
he
numbered
amongst
the
despisers
of
eos
ii
horbury
had
suffered
from
one
or
two
slight
twinges
of
conscience
for
a
few
days
after
he
had
operated
on
his
nephew
they
were
but
very
slight
pangs
for
after
all
it
was
a
case
of
flagrant
and
repeated
disobedience
to
rules
complicated
by
lying
the
high
usher
was
quite
sincere
in
scouting
the
notion
of
a
boy
taking
any
interest
in
norman
architecture
and
as
he
said
to
himself
truly
enough
if
every
boy
at
lupton
could
come
and
go
when
and
how
he
pleased
and
choose
which
rules
he
would
keep
and
which
disobey
why
the
school
would
soon
be
in
a
pretty
state
still
there
was
a
very
faint
and
indistinct
murmur
in
his
mind
which
suggested
that
meyrick
had
received
in
addition
to
his
own
proper
thrashing
the
thrashings
due
to
the
head
his
cook
and
his
wine
merchant
and
horbury
was
rather
sorry
for
he
desired
to
be
just
according
to
his
definition
of
justice
unless
indeed
justice
should
be
excessively
inconvenient
but
these
faint
scruples
were
soon
removed
turned
indeed
to
satisfaction
by
the
evident
improvement
which
declared
itself
in
ambrose
meyrick
whole
tone
and
demeanour
he
no
longer
did
his
best
to
avoid
rocker
he
played
and
played
well
and
with
relish
the
boy
was
evidently
all
right
at
heart
he
had
only
wanted
a
sharp
lesson
and
it
was
clear
that
once
a
loafer
he
was
now
on
his
way
to
be
a
credit
to
the
school
and
by
some
of
those
secret
channels
which
are
known
to
masters
and
to
masters
alone
rather
more
than
a
glimmering
of
the
truth
as
to
rawson
black
eyes
and
pelly
disfigured
nose
was
vouchsafed
to
horbury
vision
and
he
was
by
no
means
displeased
with
his
nephew
the
two
boys
had
evidently
asked
for
punishment
and
had
got
it
it
served
them
right
of
course
if
the
swearing
had
been
brought
to
his
notice
by
official
instead
of
by
subterranean
and
mystic
ways
he
would
have
had
to
cane
meyrick
a
second
time
since
by
the
public
school
convention
an
oath
is
a
very
serious
offence
as
bad
as
smoking
or
worse
but
being
far
from
a
fool
under
the
circumstances
he
made
nothing
of
it
then
the
lad
school
work
was
so
very
satisfactory
it
had
always
been
good
but
it
had
become
wonderfully
good
that
last
greek
prose
had
shown
real
grip
of
the
language
the
high
usher
was
pleased
his
sharp
lesson
had
brought
forth
excellent
results
and
he
foresaw
the
day
when
he
would
be
proud
of
having
taught
a
remarkably
fine
scholar
with
the
boys
ambrose
was
becoming
a
general
favourite
he
learned
not
only
to
play
rocker
he
showed
pelly
how
he
thought
that
blow
under
the
ear
should
be
dealt
with
they
all
said
he
was
a
good
fellow
but
they
could
not
make
out
why
without
apparent
reason
he
would
sometimes
burst
out
into
loud
laughter
but
he
said
it
was
something
wrong
with
his
inside
the
doctors
could
make
it
out
and
this
seemed
rather
interesting
in
after
life
he
often
looked
back
upon
this
period
when
to
all
appearance
lupton
was
making
a
man
of
him
and
wondered
at
its
strangeness
to
boys
and
masters
alike
he
was
an
absolutely
normal
schoolboy
busy
with
the
same
interests
as
the
rest
of
them
there
was
certainly
something
rather
queer
in
his
appearance
but
as
they
said
generously
enough
a
fellow
could
help
his
looks
and
that
curious
glint
in
the
eyes
apart
he
seemed
as
good
a
luptonian
as
any
in
the
whole
six
hundred
everybody
thought
that
he
had
absolutely
fallen
into
line
that
he
was
absorbing
the
of
the
place
in
the
most
admirable
fashion
subduing
his
own
individuality
his
opinions
his
habits
to
the
general
tone
of
the
community
around
him
putting
off
as
it
were
the
profane
dust
of
his
own
spirit
and
putting
on
the
mental
frock
of
the
brotherhood
this
of
course
is
one
of
the
aims
rather
great
aim
of
the
system
this
fashioning
of
very
diverse
characters
into
one
common
form
so
that
each
great
public
school
has
its
type
which
is
easily
recognisable
in
the
man
years
after
his
school
days
are
over
thus
in
far
lands
in
india
and
egypt
in
canada
and
new
zealand
one
recognises
the
brisk
alertness
of
the
etonian
the
exquisite
politeness
of
harrow
the
profound
seriousness
of
rugby
while
the
note
of
lupton
may
perhaps
be
called
finality
the
old
luptonian
no
more
thinks
of
arguing
a
question
than
does
the
holy
father
and
his
conversation
is
a
series
of
irreformable
dogmas
and
the
captious
person
who
questions
any
one
article
is
made
to
feel
himself
a
cad
and
an
outsider
thus
it
has
been
related
that
two
men
who
had
met
for
the
first
time
at
a
certain
country
were
getting
on
together
capitally
in
the
evening
over
their
whisky
and
soda
and
cigars
each
held
identical
views
of
equal
violence
on
some
important
topic
home
rule
or
the
transvaal
or
free
trade
and
as
the
more
masterful
of
the
two
asserted
that
hanging
was
too
good
for
blank
naming
a
statesman
the
other
would
reply
i
quite
agree
with
you
hanging
is
too
good
for
blank
he
ought
to
be
burned
alive
said
the
one
that
about
it
he
ought
to
be
burned
at
the
stake
answered
the
other
look
at
the
way
he
treated
dash
he
a
coward
and
a
damned
scoundrel
perfectly
right
he
a
damned
cursed
scoundrel
this
was
splendid
and
each
thought
the
other
a
charming
companion
unfortunately
however
the
conversation
by
some
caprice
veered
from
the
iniquities
of
blank
and
glanced
aside
to
cookery
possibly
by
the
track
of
irish
stew
used
metaphorically
to
express
the
disastrous
and
iniquitous
policy
of
the
great
statesman
with
regard
to
ireland
but
as
it
happened
there
was
not
the
same
coincidence
on
the
question
of
cookery
as
there
had
been
on
the
question
of
blank
the
masterful
man
said
no
cookery
like
english
no
other
race
in
the
world
can
cook
as
we
do
look
at
french
cookery
a
lot
of
filthy
greasy
messes
now
instead
of
assenting
briskly
and
firmly
as
before
the
other
man
said
been
much
in
france
lived
there
never
set
foot
in
the
beastly
country
do
like
their
ways
and
care
to
dine
off
snails
and
frogs
swimming
in
oil
the
other
man
began
then
to
talk
of
the
simple
but
excellent
meals
he
had
relished
in
france
the
savoury
the
good
eating
when
flavoured
by
a
gherkin
or
two
velvety
au
a
roast
partridge
a
salad
a
bit
of
roquefort
and
a
bunch
of
grapes
but
he
had
barely
mentioned
the
soup
when
the
masterful
one
wheeled
round
his
chair
and
offered
a
fine
view
of
his
strong
figure
as
seen
from
the
back
he
did
not
say
anything
he
simply
took
up
the
paper
and
went
on
smoking
the
other
men
stared
in
amazement
the
amateur
of
french
cookery
looked
annoyed
but
the
host
a
old
fellow
with
a
white
moustache
turned
to
the
enemy
of
frogs
and
snails
and
grease
and
said
quite
simply
i
say
mulock
i
never
knew
you
been
at
lupton
mulock
gazed
the
other
men
held
their
breath
for
a
moment
as
the
full
force
of
the
situation
dawned
on
them
and
then
a
wild
scream
of
laughter
shrilled
from
their
throats
yells
and
roars
of
mirth
resounded
in
the
room
their
delight
was
insatiable
it
died
for
a
moment
for
lack
of
breath
and
then
burst
out
anew
in
still
louder
more
uproarious
clamour
till
old
sir
henry
rawnsley
who
was
fat
and
short
could
do
nothing
but
choke
and
gasp
and
crow
out
a
sound
something
between
a
wheeze
and
a
chuckle
mulock
left
the
room
immediately
and
the
house
the
next
morning
he
made
some
excuse
to
his
host
but
he
told
enquiring
friends
that
personally
he
disliked
bounders
the
story
true
or
false
illustrates
the
common
view
of
the
lupton
stamp
we
try
to
teach
the
boys
to
know
their
own
minds
said
the
headmaster
and
the
endeavour
seems
to
have
succeeded
in
most
cases
and
as
horbury
noted
in
an
article
he
once
wrote
on
the
public
school
system
every
boy
was
expected
to
submit
himself
to
the
process
to
form
and
reform
himself
in
accordance
with
the
tone
of
the
school
i
sometimes
compare
our
work
with
that
of
the
metal
founder
he
says
in
the
article
in
question
just
as
the
metal
comes
to
the
foundry
indigestaque
a
rough
and
formless
mass
without
the
slightest
suggestion
of
the
shape
which
it
must
finally
assume
so
a
boy
comes
to
a
great
public
school
with
little
or
nothing
about
him
to
suggest
the
young
man
who
in
eight
or
nine
years
time
will
say
to
the
dear
old
school
setting
his
teeth
tight
restraining
himself
from
giving
up
to
the
anguish
of
this
last
farewell
nay
i
think
that
ours
is
the
harder
task
for
the
metal
that
is
sent
to
the
foundry
has
i
presume
been
freed
of
its
impurities
we
have
to
deal
rather
with
the
ore
a
mass
which
is
not
only
shapeless
but
contains
much
that
is
not
metal
at
all
which
must
be
burnt
out
and
cast
aside
as
useless
rubbish
so
the
boy
comes
from
his
home
which
may
or
may
not
have
possessed
valuable
formative
influences
which
we
often
find
has
tended
to
create
a
spirit
of
individualism
and
assertiveness
which
in
numerous
cases
has
left
the
boy
under
the
delusion
that
he
has
come
into
the
world
to
live
his
own
life
and
think
his
own
thoughts
this
is
the
ore
that
we
cast
into
our
furnace
we
burn
out
the
dross
and
rubbish
we
liquefy
the
stubborn
and
resisting
metal
till
it
can
be
run
into
the
mould
the
mould
being
the
whole
tone
and
feeling
of
a
great
community
we
discourage
all
excessive
individuality
we
make
it
quite
plain
to
the
boy
that
he
has
come
to
lupton
not
to
live
his
life
not
to
think
his
thoughts
but
to
live
life
to
think
thoughts
very
often
as
i
think
i
need
scarcely
say
the
process
is
a
somewhat
unpleasant
one
but
sooner
or
later
the
stubbornest
metal
yields
to
the
cleansing
renewing
restoring
fires
of
discipline
and
public
opinion
and
the
shapeless
mass
takes
on
the
shape
of
the
great
school
only
the
other
day
an
old
pupil
came
to
see
me
and
confessed
that
for
the
whole
of
his
first
year
at
lupton
he
had
been
profoundly
wretched
was
a
dreamy
young
fool
he
said
head
was
stuffed
with
all
sorts
of
queer
fancies
and
i
expect
that
if
i
had
come
to
lupton
i
should
have
turned
out
an
absolute
loafer
but
i
hated
it
badly
that
first
year
i
loathed
rocker
i
did
really
and
i
thought
the
fellows
were
a
lot
of
savages
and
then
i
seemed
to
go
into
a
kind
of
cloud
you
see
sir
i
was
losing
my
old
self
and
had
got
the
new
self
in
its
place
and
i
could
make
out
what
was
happening
and
then
quite
suddenly
it
all
came
out
light
and
clear
i
saw
the
purpose
behind
it
all
how
we
were
all
working
together
masters
and
boys
for
the
dear
old
school
how
we
were
all
members
one
of
another
as
the
doctor
said
in
chapel
and
that
i
had
a
part
in
this
great
work
too
though
i
was
only
a
kid
in
the
third
it
was
like
a
flash
of
light
one
minute
i
was
only
a
poor
little
chap
that
nobody
cared
for
and
who
did
matter
to
anybody
and
the
next
i
saw
that
in
a
way
i
was
as
important
as
the
doctor
himself
i
was
a
part
of
the
failure
or
success
of
it
all
do
you
know
what
i
did
sir
i
had
a
book
i
thought
a
lot
of
and
of
edgar
allan
poe
it
was
my
poor
sister
book
she
had
died
a
year
before
when
she
was
only
seventeen
and
she
had
written
my
name
in
it
when
she
was
dying
she
knew
i
was
fond
of
reading
it
it
was
just
the
sort
of
thing
i
used
to
like
morbid
fancies
and
queer
poems
and
i
was
always
reading
it
when
the
fellows
would
let
me
alone
but
when
i
saw
what
life
really
was
when
the
meaning
of
it
all
came
to
me
as
i
said
just
now
i
took
that
book
and
tore
it
to
bits
and
it
was
like
tearing
myself
up
but
i
knew
that
writing
all
that
stuff
had
done
that
american
fellow
much
good
and
i
did
see
what
good
i
should
get
by
reading
it
i
could
make
out
to
myself
that
it
would
fit
in
with
the
doctor
plans
of
the
spirit
of
the
school
or
that
i
should
play
up
at
rocker
any
better
for
knowing
all
about
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
or
whatever
it
called
i
knew
my
poor
sister
would
understand
so
i
tore
it
up
and
i
gone
straight
ahead
ever
since
thanks
to
lupton
a
refiner
remembered
the
dreamy
child
of
fifteen
years
before
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
stood
before
keen
alert
practical
living
every
moment
of
his
life
a
force
a
power
in
the
world
certain
of
successful
achievement
such
were
the
influences
to
which
ambrose
meyrick
was
being
subjected
and
with
infinite
success
as
it
seemed
to
everybody
who
watched
him
he
was
regarded
as
a
conspicuous
instance
of
the
efficacy
of
the
system
he
had
held
out
so
long
refusing
to
absorb
the
tone
presenting
an
obstinate
surface
to
the
millstones
which
would
for
his
own
good
have
ground
him
to
powder
not
concealing
very
much
his
dislike
of
the
place
and
of
the
people
in
it
and
suddenly
he
had
submitted
with
a
good
grace
it
was
wonderful
the
masters
are
believed
to
have
discussed
the
affair
amongst
themselves
and
horbury
who
confessed
or
boasted
that
he
had
used
sharp
persuasion
got
a
good
deal
of
in
consequence
iii
a
few
years
ago
a
little
book
called
attracted
some
attention
in
circles
it
was
anonymous
and
bore
the
modest
motto
bis
but
those
behind
the
scenes
recognised
it
as
the
work
of
charles
palmer
who
was
for
many
years
a
master
at
lupton
his
acknowledged
books
include
a
useful
little
work
on
the
accents
and
an
excellent
summary
of
roman
history
from
the
fall
of
the
republic
to
romulus
augustulus
the
contains
the
following
amusing
passage
there
is
not
much
difficulty
in
identifying
the
mentioned
in
it
with
ambrose
meyrick
the
cleverest
dominie
sometimes
discovers
the
passage
begins
that
he
has
been
living
in
a
fool
paradise
that
he
has
been
tricked
by
a
quiet
and
persistent
subtlety
that
really
strikes
one
as
almost
devilish
when
one
finds
it
exhibited
in
the
person
of
an
english
schoolboy
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
i
think
has
been
written
about
boys
by
people
who
in
reality
know
very
little
about
them
they
have
been
credited
with
complexities
of
character
with
feelings
and
aspirations
and
delicacies
of
sentiment
which
are
quite
foreign
to
their
nature
i
can
quite
believe
in
the
dead
cat
trick
of
stalky
and
his
friends
but
i
confess
that
the
incident
of
the
british
flag
leaves
me
cold
and
sceptical
such
refinement
of
perception
is
not
the
way
of
the
boy
certainly
not
of
the
boy
as
i
have
known
him
he
is
radically
a
simple
soul
whose
feelings
are
on
the
surface
and
his
deepest
laid
schemes
and
manoeuvres
hardly
call
for
the
talents
of
a
sherlock
holmes
if
they
are
to
be
detected
and
brought
to
naught
of
course
a
good
deal
of
rubbish
has
been
talked
about
the
wonderful
success
of
our
english
plan
of
leaving
the
boys
to
themselves
without
the
everlasting
supervision
which
is
practised
in
french
schools
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
english
schoolboy
is
under
constant
supervision
where
in
a
french
school
one
wretched
usher
has
to
look
after
a
whole
horde
of
boys
in
an
english
school
each
boy
is
perpetually
under
the
observation
of
hundreds
of
his
fellows
in
reality
each
boy
is
an
unpaid
a
watchdog
whose
vigilance
never
relaxes
he
is
not
aware
of
this
one
need
scarcely
say
that
such
a
notion
is
far
from
his
wildest
thoughts
he
thinks
and
very
rightly
doubtless
that
he
is
engaged
in
maintaining
the
honour
of
the
school
in
keeping
up
the
observance
of
the
school
tradition
in
dealing
sharply
with
slackers
and
loafers
who
would
bring
discredit
on
the
place
he
loves
so
well
he
is
no
doubt
absolutely
right
in
all
this
none
the
less
he
is
doing
the
master
work
unwittingly
and
admirably
when
one
thinks
of
this
and
of
the
compulsory
system
of
games
which
ensures
that
every
boy
shall
be
in
a
certain
place
at
a
certain
time
one
sees
i
think
that
the
phrase
about
our
lack
of
supervision
a
phrase
and
nothing
more
there
is
no
system
of
supervision
known
to
human
wit
that
approaches
in
thoroughness
and
minuteness
the
supervision
under
which
every
single
boy
is
kept
all
through
his
life
at
an
english
public
school
hence
one
is
really
rather
surprised
when
in
spite
of
all
these
unpaid
assistants
who
are
the
whole
school
one
is
thoroughly
and
completely
taken
in
i
can
only
remember
one
such
case
and
i
am
still
astonished
at
the
really
infernal
ability
with
which
the
boy
in
question
lived
a
double
life
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
masters
and
six
hundred
other
boys
as
i
shall
call
him
was
not
in
my
house
and
i
can
scarcely
say
how
i
came
to
watch
his
career
with
so
much
interest
but
there
was
certainly
something
about
him
which
did
interest
me
a
good
deal
it
may
have
been
his
appearance
he
was
an
boy
dark
almost
swarthy
dreamy
and
absent
in
manner
and
for
the
first
years
of
his
school
life
a
quite
typical
loafer
such
boys
of
course
are
not
common
in
a
big
school
but
there
are
a
few
such
everywhere
one
never
knows
whether
this
kind
will
write
a
successful
book
or
paint
a
great
picture
or
go
to
the
devil
from
my
observation
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
the
last
career
is
the
most
usual
i
need
scarcely
say
that
such
boys
meet
with
but
little
encouragement
it
is
not
the
type
which
the
public
school
exists
to
foster
and
the
boy
who
abandons
himself
to
morbid
introspection
is
soon
made
to
feel
pretty
emphatically
that
he
is
matter
in
the
wrong
place
of
course
one
may
be
crushing
genius
if
this
ever
happened
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
still
in
all
communities
the
minority
must
suffer
for
the
good
of
the
majority
and
frankly
i
have
always
been
willing
to
run
the
risk
as
i
have
hinted
the
particular
sort
of
boy
i
have
in
my
mind
turns
out
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
to
be
not
a
genius
but
that
much
more
common
type
a
blackguard
well
as
i
say
i
was
curious
about
i
was
sorry
for
him
too
both
his
parents
were
dead
and
he
was
rather
in
the
position
of
the
poor
fellows
who
have
no
home
life
to
look
forward
to
when
the
holidays
are
getting
near
and
his
obstinacy
astonished
me
in
most
cases
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
will
bring
the
slackest
loafer
to
a
sense
of
the
error
of
his
ways
before
his
first
term
is
ended
but
seemed
to
hold
out
against
us
all
with
a
sort
of
dreamy
resistance
that
was
most
exasperating
i
do
not
think
he
can
have
had
a
very
pleasant
time
his
general
demeanour
suggested
that
of
a
sage
who
has
been
cast
on
an
island
inhabited
by
a
peculiarly
repulsive
and
degraded
tribe
of
savages
and
i
need
scarcely
say
that
the
other
boys
did
their
best
to
make
him
realise
the
extreme
absurdity
of
such
behaviour
he
was
clever
enough
at
his
work
but
it
was
difficult
to
make
him
play
games
and
impossible
to
make
him
play
up
he
seemed
to
be
looking
through
us
at
something
else
and
neither
the
boys
nor
the
masters
liked
being
treated
as
unimportant
illusions
and
then
quite
suddenly
altered
completely
i
believe
his
housemaster
worn
out
of
all
patience
gave
him
a
severe
thrashing
at
any
rate
the
change
was
instant
and
marvellous
i
remember
that
a
few
days
before
transformation
we
had
been
discussing
the
question
of
the
cane
at
the
weekly
masters
meeting
i
had
confessed
myself
a
very
believer
in
the
efficacy
of
the
treatment
i
forget
the
arguments
that
i
used
but
i
know
that
i
was
strongly
inclined
to
favour
the
party
as
the
head
jocosely
named
it
but
a
few
months
later
when
housemaster
pointed
out
playing
up
at
football
like
a
young
demon
and
then
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
reminded
me
of
the
position
i
had
taken
up
at
the
masters
meeting
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
own
that
i
had
been
in
the
wrong
the
cane
had
certainly
in
this
case
proved
itself
a
magic
wand
the
sometime
loafer
had
been
transformed
by
it
into
one
of
the
healthiest
and
most
energetic
fellows
in
the
whole
school
it
was
a
pleasure
to
watch
him
at
the
games
and
i
remember
that
his
fast
bowling
was
at
once
terrific
in
speed
and
peculiarly
deadly
in
its
accuracy
he
kept
up
this
deception
for
deception
it
was
for
three
or
four
years
he
was
just
going
up
to
oxford
and
the
whole
school
was
looking
forward
to
a
career
which
we
knew
would
be
quite
exceptional
in
its
brilliance
his
scholarship
papers
astonished
the
balliol
authorities
i
remember
one
of
the
fellows
writing
to
our
head
about
them
in
terms
of
the
greatest
enthusiasm
and
we
all
knew
that
bowling
would
get
him
into
the
university
eleven
in
his
first
term
cricketers
have
not
yet
forgotten
a
certain
performance
of
his
at
the
oval
when
as
a
poetic
journalist
observed
wickets
fell
before
him
as
ripe
corn
falls
before
the
sickle
disappeared
in
the
middle
of
term
the
whole
school
was
in
a
ferment
masters
and
boys
looked
at
one
another
with
wild
faces
search
parties
were
sent
out
to
scour
the
country
the
police
were
communicated
with
on
every
side
one
heard
the
strangest
surmises
as
to
what
had
happened
the
affair
got
into
the
papers
most
people
thought
it
was
a
case
of
breakdown
and
loss
of
memory
from
overwork
and
mental
strain
nothing
could
be
heard
of
till
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
his
housemaster
came
into
our
room
looking
as
i
thought
puzzled
and
frightened
do
understand
he
said
had
this
by
the
second
post
in
handwriting
i
ca
make
head
or
tail
of
it
it
some
sort
of
french
i
suppose
he
held
out
a
paper
closely
written
in
exquisite
curious
script
which
always
reminded
me
vaguely
of
some
oriental
character
the
masters
shook
their
heads
as
the
manuscript
went
from
hand
to
hand
and
one
of
them
suggested
sending
for
the
french
master
but
as
it
happened
i
was
something
of
a
student
of
old
french
myself
and
i
found
i
could
make
out
the
drift
of
the
document
that
had
sent
his
master
it
was
written
in
the
manner
and
in
the
language
of
rabelais
it
was
quite
diabolically
clever
and
beyond
all
question
the
filthiest
thing
i
have
ever
read
the
writer
had
really
exceeded
his
master
in
obscenity
impossible
as
that
might
seem
the
purport
of
it
all
was
a
kind
of
nightmare
vision
of
the
school
the
masters
and
the
boys
everybody
and
everything
were
distorted
in
the
most
horrible
manner
seen
we
might
say
through
an
abominable
glass
and
yet
every
feature
was
easily
recognisable
it
reminded
me
of
swift
disgusting
description
of
the
yahoos
over
which
one
may
shudder
and
grow
sick
but
which
one
can
not
affect
to
misunderstand
there
was
a
fantastic
episode
which
i
remember
especially
one
of
us
an
ambitious
man
who
for
some
reason
or
other
had
become
unpopular
with
a
few
of
his
colleagues
was
described
as
endeavouring
to
climb
the
school
on
the
top
of
which
a
certain
object
was
said
to
be
placed
the
object
was
defended
so
the
writer
affirmed
by
dark
birds
of
night
who
resisted
the
approach
in
all
possible
and
impossible
manners
even
to
indicate
the
way
in
which
this
extraordinary
theme
was
treated
would
be
utterly
out
of
the
question
but
i
shall
never
forget
the
description
of
the
master
face
turned
up
towards
the
object
of
his
quest
as
he
painfully
climbed
the
wall
i
have
never
read
even
in
the
most
filthy
pages
of
rabelais
or
in
the
savagest
passages
of
swift
anything
which
approached
the
revolting
cruelty
of
those
few
lines
they
were
compounded
of
and
the
cloaca
maxima
i
read
out
and
translated
a
few
of
the
least
abominable
sentences
i
can
hardly
say
whether
the
feeling
of
disgust
or
that
of
bewilderment
predominated
amongst
us
one
of
my
colleagues
stopped
me
and
said
they
had
heard
enough
we
stared
at
one
another
in
silence
the
astounding
ability
ferocity
and
obscenity
of
the
whole
thing
left
us
quite
dumbfounded
and
i
remember
saying
that
if
a
volcano
were
suddenly
to
belch
forth
volumes
of
flame
and
filth
in
the
middle
of
the
playing
fields
i
should
scarcely
be
more
astonished
and
all
this
was
the
work
of
whose
brilliant
abilities
in
games
and
in
the
schools
were
to
have
been
worth
many
thousands
a
year
to
as
one
of
us
put
it
this
was
the
boy
that
for
the
last
four
years
we
had
considered
as
a
great
example
of
the
formative
influences
of
the
school
this
was
the
who
we
thought
would
have
died
for
the
honour
of
the
school
who
spoke
as
if
he
could
never
do
enough
to
repay
what
had
done
for
him
as
i
say
we
looked
at
one
another
with
faces
of
blank
amazement
and
horror
at
last
somebody
said
that
must
have
gone
mad
and
we
tried
to
believe
that
it
was
so
for
madness
awful
calamity
as
it
is
would
be
more
endurable
than
sanity
under
such
circumstances
as
these
i
need
scarcely
say
that
this
charitable
hypothesis
turned
out
to
be
quite
unfounded
was
perfectly
sane
he
was
simply
revenging
himself
for
the
suppression
of
his
true
feelings
for
the
four
last
years
of
his
school
life
the
on
which
we
prided
ourselves
had
been
an
utter
sham
the
whole
of
his
life
had
been
an
elaborately
organised
hypocrisy
maintained
with
unfailing
and
unflinching
skill
term
after
term
and
year
after
year
one
can
not
help
wondering
when
one
considers
the
inner
life
of
this
unhappy
fellow
every
morning
i
suppose
he
woke
up
with
curses
in
his
soul
he
smiled
at
us
all
and
joined
in
the
games
with
black
rage
devouring
him
so
far
as
one
can
say
he
was
quite
sincere
in
his
concealed
opinions
at
all
events
the
hatred
loathing
and
contempt
of
the
whole
system
of
the
place
displayed
in
that
extraordinary
and
terrible
document
struck
me
as
quite
genuine
and
while
i
was
reading
it
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
his
eager
enthusiastic
face
as
he
joined
with
a
will
in
the
school
songs
he
seemed
to
inspire
all
the
boys
about
him
with
something
of
his
own
energy
and
devotion
the
apparition
was
a
shocking
one
i
felt
that
for
a
moment
i
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
region
that
was
very
like
hell
itself
i
remember
that
the
french
master
contributed
a
characteristic
touch
of
his
own
of
course
the
headmaster
had
to
be
told
of
the
matter
and
it
was
arranged
that
and
myself
should
collaborate
in
the
unpleasant
task
of
making
a
translation
read
the
horrible
stuff
through
with
an
expression
on
his
face
that
to
my
astonishment
bordered
on
admiration
and
when
he
laid
down
the
paper
he
said
bien
ma√Ætre
fran√ßois
est
encore
en
vie
√©videmment
le
vrai
renouveau
de
la
renaissance
de
la

en

mauvaise

si
vous
voulez

v√©ritable
je
vous
assure
mais
notre

un
rabelais
qui
a

une

affreusement
i
really
think
that
to
the
frenchman
the
terrible
moral
aspect
of
the
case
was
either
entirely
negligible
or
absolutely
he
simply
looked
on
detestable
and
filthy
performance
as
a
little
masterpiece
in
a
particular
literary
heaven
knows
one
does
not
want
to
be
a
pharisee
but
as
i
saw
grinning
appreciatively
over
this
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
the
collapse
of
france
before
germany
offered
no
insoluble
problem
to
the
historian
there
is
little
more
to
be
said
as
to
this
extraordinary
and
most
unpleasant
affair
it
was
all
hushed
up
as
much
as
possible
no
further
attempts
to
discover
whereabouts
were
made
it
was
some
months
before
we
heard
by
indirect
means
that
the
wretched
fellow
had
abandoned
the
balliol
scholarship
and
the
most
brilliant
prospects
in
life
to
attach
himself
to
a
company
of
greasy
barnstormers
or
artists
as
i
suppose
they
would
be
called
nowadays
i
believe
that
his
subsequent
career
has
been
of
a
piece
with
these
beginnings
but
of
that
i
desire
to
say
nothing
the
passage
has
been
quoted
merely
in
evidence
of
the
great
success
with
which
ambrose
meyrick
adapted
himself
to
his
environment
at
lupton
palmer
the
writer
who
was
a
very
though
intensely
stupid
person
has
told
the
bare
facts
as
he
saw
them
accurately
enough
it
need
not
be
said
that
his
inferences
and
deductions
from
the
facts
are
invariably
ridiculous
he
was
a
man
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
thought
that
rabelais
monk
gay
life
in
paris
and
la
all
came
to
much
the
same
thing
iv
in
an
old
notebook
kept
by
ambrose
meyrick
in
those
days
there
are
some
curious
entries
which
throw
light
on
the
extraordinary
experiences
that
befell
him
during
the
period
which
poor
palmer
has
done
his
best
to
illustrate
the
following
is
interesting
i
told
her
she
must
not
come
again
for
a
long
time
she
was
astonished
and
asked
me
why
was
i
not
fond
of
her
i
said
it
was
because
i
was
so
fond
of
her
that
i
was
afraid
that
if
i
saw
her
often
i
could
not
live
i
should
pass
away
in
delight
because
our
bodies
are
not
meant
to
live
for
long
in
the
middle
of
white
fire
i
was
lying
on
my
bed
and
she
stood
beside
it
i
looked
up
at
her
the
room
was
very
dark
and
still
i
could
only
just
see
her
faintly
though
she
was
so
close
to
me
that
i
could
hear
her
breathing
quite
well
i
thought
of
the
white
flowers
that
grew
in
the
dark
corners
of
the
old
garden
at
the
wern
by
the
great
ilex
tree
i
used
to
go
out
on
summer
nights
when
the
air
was
still
and
all
the
sky
cloudy
one
could
hear
the
brook
just
a
little
down
beyond
the
watery
meadow
and
all
the
woods
and
hills
were
dim
one
could
not
see
the
mountain
at
all
but
i
liked
to
stand
by
the
wall
and
look
into
the
darkest
place
and
in
a
little
time
those
flowers
would
seem
to
grow
out
of
the
shadow
i
could
just
see
the
white
glimmer
of
them
she
looked
like
the
flowers
to
me
as
i
lay
on
the
bed
in
my
dark
room
sometimes
i
dream
of
wonderful
things
it
is
just
at
the
moment
when
one
wakes
up
one
can
not
say
where
one
has
been
or
what
was
so
wonderful
but
you
know
that
you
have
lost
everything
in
waking
for
just
that
moment
you
knew
everything
and
understood
the
stars
and
the
hills
and
night
and
day
and
the
woods
and
the
old
songs
they
were
all
within
you
and
you
were
all
light
but
the
light
was
music
and
the
music
was
violet
wine
in
a
great
cup
of
gold
and
the
wine
in
the
golden
cup
was
the
scent
of
a
june
night
i
understood
all
this
as
she
stood
beside
my
bed
in
the
dark
and
stretched
out
her
hand
and
touched
me
on
the
breast
i
knew
a
pool
in
an
old
old
grey
wood
a
few
miles
from
the
wern
i
called
it
the
grey
wood
because
the
trees
were
ancient
oaks
that
they
say
must
have
grown
there
for
a
thousand
years
and
they
have
grown
bare
and
terrible
most
of
them
are
all
hollow
inside
and
some
have
only
a
few
boughs
left
and
every
year
they
say
one
leaf
less
grows
on
every
bough
in
the
books
they
are
called
the
foresters
oaks
if
you
stay
under
them
you
feel
as
if
the
old
times
must
have
come
again
among
these
trees
there
was
a
great
yew
far
older
than
the
oaks
and
beneath
it
a
dark
and
shadowy
pool
i
had
been
for
a
long
walk
nearly
to
the
sea
and
as
i
came
back
i
passed
this
place
and
looking
into
the
pool
there
was
the
glint
of
the
stars
in
the
water
she
knelt
by
my
bed
in
the
dark
and
i
could
just
see
the
glinting
of
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
me
the
stars
in
the
shadowy
waterpool
i
had
never
dreamed
that
there
could
be
anything
so
wonderful
in
the
whole
world
my
father
had
told
me
of
many
beautiful
and
holy
and
glorious
things
of
all
the
heavenly
mysteries
by
which
those
who
know
live
for
ever
all
the
things
which
the
doctor
and
my
uncle
and
the
other
silly
clergymen
in
the
chapel
because
they
do
really
know
anything
at
all
about
them
only
their
names
so
they
are
like
dogs
and
pigs
and
asses
who
have
somehow
found
their
way
into
a
beautiful
room
full
of
precious
and
delicate
treasures
these
things
my
father
told
me
of
long
ago
of
the
great
mystery
of
the
offering
footnote
a
highly
rabelaisian
phrase
is
omitted
and
i
have
learned
the
wonders
of
the
old
venerable
saints
that
once
were
marvels
in
our
land
as
the
welch
poem
says
and
of
all
the
great
works
that
shone
around
their
feet
as
they
went
upon
the
mountains
and
sought
the
deserts
of
ocean
i
have
seen
their
marks
and
writings
cut
on
the
edges
of
the
rocks
i
know
where
sagramnus
lies
buried
in
wlad
morgan
and
i
shall
not
forget
how
i
saw
the
blessed
cup
of
teilo
agyos
drawn
out
from
golden
veils
on
mynydd
mawr
when
the
stars
poured
out
of
the
jewel
and
i
saw
the
sea
of
the
saints
and
the
spiritual
things
in
my
father
read
out
to
me
all
the
histories
of
teilo
dewi
and
iltyd
of
their
marvellous
chalices
and
altars
of
paradise
from
which
they
made
the
books
of
the
graal
afterwards
and
all
these
things
are
beautiful
to
me
but
as
the
anointed
bard
said
the
bodily
lips
i
receive
the
drink
of
mortal
vineyards
with
spiritual
understanding
wine
from
the
garths
of
the
undying
may
mihangel
intercede
for
me
that
these
may
be
mingled
in
one
cup
let
the
door
between
body
and
soul
be
thrown
open
for
in
that
day
earth
will
have
become
paradise
and
the
secret
sayings
of
the
bards
shall
be
verified
i
always
knew
what
this
meant
though
my
father
told
me
that
many
people
thought
it
obscure
or
rather
nonsense
but
it
is
just
the
same
really
as
another
poem
by
the
same
bard
where
he
says
sin
was
found
out
and
when
the
old
women
on
the
bridge
pointed
at
me
i
was
ashamed
i
was
deeply
grieved
when
the
boys
shouted
rebukes
as
i
went
from
how
is
it
that
i
was
not
ashamed
before
the
finger
of
the
almighty
i
did
not
suffer
agony
at
the
rebuke
of
the
most
high
the
fist
of
rhys
fawr
is
more
dreadful
to
me
than
the
hand
of
god
he
means
i
think
that
our
great
loss
is
that
we
separate
what
is
one
and
make
it
two
and
then
having
done
so
we
make
the
less
real
into
the
more
real
as
if
we
thought
the
glass
made
to
hold
wine
more
important
than
the
wine
it
holds
and
this
is
what
i
had
felt
for
it
was
only
twice
that
i
had
known
wonders
in
my
body
when
i
saw
the
cup
of
teilo
sant
and
when
the
mountains
appeared
in
vision
and
so
as
the
bard
says
the
door
is
shut
the
life
of
bodily
things
is
just
as
the
wineglass
is
hard
we
can
touch
it
and
feel
it
and
see
it
always
before
us
the
wine
is
drunk
and
forgotten
it
can
not
be
held
i
believe
the
air
about
us
is
just
as
substantial
as
a
mountain
or
a
cathedral
but
unless
we
remind
ourselves
we
think
of
the
air
as
nothing
it
is
not
but
now
i
was
in
paradise
for
body
and
soul
were
molten
in
one
fire
and
went
up
in
one
flame
the
mortal
and
the
immortal
vines
were
made
one
through
the
joy
of
the
body
i
possessed
the
joy
of
the
spirit
and
it
was
so
strange
to
think
that
all
this
was
through
a
woman
through
a
woman
i
had
seen
dozens
of
times
and
had
thought
nothing
of
except
that
she
was
and
that
the
colour
of
her
hair
like
copper
was
very
beautiful
i
can
not
understand
it
i
can
not
feel
that
she
is
really
nelly
foran
who
opens
the
door
and
waits
at
table
for
she
is
a
miracle
how
i
should
have
wondered
once
if
i
had
seen
a
stone
by
the
roadside
become
a
jewel
of
fire
and
glory
but
if
that
were
to
happen
it
would
not
be
so
strange
as
what
happened
to
me
i
can
not
see
now
the
black
dress
and
the
servant
cap
and
apron
i
see
the
wonderful
beautiful
body
shining
through
the
darkness
of
my
room
the
glimmering
of
the
white
flower
in
the
dark
the
stars
in
the
forest
pool
gift
of
the
everlasting
o
wonderful
and
hidden
mystery
many
secrets
have
been
vouchsafed
to
me
i
have
been
long
acquainted
with
the
wisdom
of
the
trees
ash
and
oak
and
elm
have
communicated
to
me
from
my
boyhood
the
birch
and
the
hazel
and
all
the
trees
of
the
green
wood
have
not
been
dumb
there
is
a
caldron
rimmed
with
pearls
of
whose
gifts
i
am
not
ignorant
i
will
speak
little
of
it
its
treasures
are
known
to
bards
many
went
on
the
search
of
seven
alone
returned
with
arthur
but
my
spirit
was
present
seven
are
the
apple
trees
in
a
beautiful
orchard
i
have
eaten
of
their
fruit
which
is
not
bestowed
on
saxons
i
am
not
ignorant
of
a
head
which
is
glorious
and
venerable
it
made
perpetual
entertainment
for
the
warriors
their
joys
would
have
been
immortal
if
they
had
not
opened
the
door
of
the
south
they
could
have
feasted
for
ever
listening
to
the
song
of
the
fairy
birds
of
rhiannon
let
not
anyone
instruct
me
concerning
the
glassy
isle
in
the
garments
of
the
saints
who
returned
from
it
were
rich
odours
of
paradise
all
this
i
knew
and
yet
my
knowledge
was
ignorance
for
one
day
as
i
walked
by
in
the
principal
forest
of
gwent
i
saw
golden
myfanwy
as
she
bathed
in
the
brook
tar√≥gi
her
hair
flowed
about
her
arthur
crown
had
dissolved
into
a
shining
mist
i
gazed
into
her
blue
eyes
as
it
were
into
twin
heavens
all
the
parts
of
her
body
were
adornments
and
miracles
o
gift
of
the
everlasting
o
wonderful
and
hidden
mystery
when
i
embraced
myfanwy
a
moment
became
immortality
footnote
translated
from
the
welsh
verses
quoted
in
the
notebook
and
yet
i
daresay
this
myfanwy
was
what
people
call
common
girl
and
perhaps
she
did
rough
hard
work
and
nobody
thought
anything
of
her
till
the
bard
found
her
bathing
in
the
brook
of
tar√≥gi
the
birds
in
the
wood
said
when
they
saw
the
nightingale
is
a
contemptible
stranger
since
i
wrote
last
in
this
book
the
summer
has
come
this
morning
i
woke
up
very
early
and
even
in
this
horrible
place
the
air
was
pure
and
bright
as
the
sun
rose
up
and
the
long
beams
shone
on
the
cedar
outside
the
window
she
came
to
me
by
the
way
they
think
is
locked
and
fastened
and
just
as
the
world
is
white
and
gold
at
the
dawn
so
was
she
a
blackbird
began
to
sing
beneath
the
window
i
think
it
came
from
far
for
it
sang
to
me
of
morning
on
the
mountain
and
the
woods
all
still
and
a
little
bright
brook
rushing
down
the
hillside
between
dark
green
alders
and
air
that
must
be
blown
from
heaven
there
is
a
bird

in

voice
is
golden
like
the
ringing
of

bells
sweet

with
melodies

footnote
the
following
translation
of
these
verses
appeared
in
from
the
old
by
taliesin
bristol
in
soar
sweet
valley
where
the
sound
of
holy
anthems
once
was
heard
from
many
a
saint
the
hills
prolong
only
the
music
of
the
bird
in
soar
sweet
valley
where
the
brook
with
many
a
ripple
flows
along
delicious
prospects
meet
the
eye
the
ear
is
charmed
with
song
in
soar
sweet
valley
once
a
maid
despising
worldly
prospects
gay
resigned
her
note
in
earthly
choirs
which
now
in
heaven
must
sound
alway
in
soar
sweet
valley
david
preached
his
gospel
accents
so
beguiled
the
savage
britons
that
they
turned
their
fiercest
cries
to
music

cybi

with
awe
in

the
song
of
sounds
and

when

taliesin
was
the
pseudonym
of
an
amiable
clergyman
the
reverend
owen
thomas
for
many
years
curate
of
llantrisant
he
died
in
at
the
great
age
of
his
original
poetry
in
welsh
was
reputed
as
far
superior
to
his
translations
and
he
made
a
very
valuable
and
curious
collection
of
cymric
antiquities
which
remains
in
manuscript
in
the
keeping
of
his
descendants
when
i
think
of
what
i
know
of
the
wonders
of
darkness
and
the
wonders
of
dawn
i
can
not
help
believing
that
i
have
found
something
which
all
the
world
has
lost
i
have
heard
some
of
the
fellows
talking
about
women
their
words
and
their
stories
are
filthy
and
nonsense
too
one
would
think
that
if
monkeys
and
pigs
could
talk
about
their
and
sows
it
would
be
just
like
that
i
might
have
thought
that
being
only
boys
they
knew
nothing
about
it
and
were
only
making
up
nasty
silly
tales
out
of
their
nasty
silly
minds
but
i
have
heard
the
poor
women
in
the
town
screaming
and
scolding
at
their
men
and
the
men
swearing
back
and
when
they
think
they
are
making
love
it
is
the
most
horrible
of
all
and
it
is
not
only
the
boys
and
the
poor
people
there
are
the
masters
and
their
wives
everybody
knows
that
the
challises
and
the
redburns
like
cats
as
they
say
and
that
the
head
daughter
was
up
for
auction
and
bought
by
the
rich
manufacturer
from
birmingham
a
horrible
fat
beast
more
than
twice
her
age
with
eyes
like
pig
they
called
it
a
splendid
match
so
i
began
to
wonder
whether
perhaps
there
are
very
few
people
in
the
world
who
know
whether
the
real
secret
is
lost
like
the
great
city
that
was
drowned
in
the
sea
and
only
seen
by
one
or
two
perhaps
it
is
more
like
those
shining
isles
that
the
saints
sought
for
where
the
deep
apple
orchards
are
and
all
the
delights
of
paradise
but
you
had
to
give
up
everything
and
get
into
a
boat
without
oar
or
sails
if
you
wanted
to
find
avalon
or
the
glassy
isle
and
sometimes
the
saints
could
stand
on
the
rocks
and
see
those
islands
far
away
in
the
midst
of
the
sea
and
smell
the
sweet
odours
and
hear
the
bells
ringing
for
the
feast
when
other
people
could
see
and
hear
nothing
at
all
i
often
think
now
how
strange
it
would
be
if
it
were
found
out
that
nearly
everybody
is
like
those
who
stood
on
the
rocks
and
could
only
see
the
waves
tossing
and
stretching
far
away
and
the
blue
sky
and
the
mist
in
the
distance
i
mean
if
it
turned
out
that
we
have
all
been
in
the
wrong
about
everything
that
we
live
in
a
world
of
the
most
wonderful
treasures
which
we
see
all
about
us
but
we
do
understand
and
kick
the
jewels
into
the
dirt
and
use
the
chalices
for
and
make
the
holy
vestments
into
while
we
worship
a
great
beast
a
monster
with
the
head
of
a
monkey
the
body
of
a
pig
and
the
hind
legs
of
a
goat
with
swarming
lice
crawling
all
over
it
suppose
that
the
people
that
they
speak
of
now
as
and
should
turn
out
to
be
in
the
right
and
very
wise
while
we
are
all
wrong
and
great
fools
it
would
be
something
like
the
man
who
lived
in
the
bright
palace
the
palace
had
a
hundred
and
one
doors
a
hundred
of
them
opened
into
gardens
of
delight
beautiful
bowers
wonderful
countries
fairy
seas
caves
of
gold
and
hills
of
diamonds
into
all
the
most
splendid
places
but
one
door
led
into
a
cesspool
and
that
was
the
only
door
that
the
man
ever
opened
it
may
be
that
his
sons
and
his
grandsons
have
been
opening
that
one
door
ever
since
till
they
have
forgotten
that
there
are
any
others
so
if
anyone
dares
to
speak
of
the
ways
to
the
garden
of
delight
or
the
hills
of
gold
he
is
called
a
madman
or
a
very
wicked
person
the
other
day
a
very
strange
thing
happened
i
had
gone
for
a
short
walk
out
of
the
town
before
dinner
on
the
dunham
road
and
came
as
far
as
the
four
ways
where
the
roads
cross
it
is
rather
pretty
for
lupton
just
there
there
is
a
plot
of
grass
with
a
big
old
elm
tree
in
the
middle
of
it
and
round
the
tree
is
a
rough
sort
of
seat
where
tramps
and
such
people
are
often
resting
as
i
came
along
i
heard
some
sort
of
music
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
tree
it
was
like
fairies
dancing
and
then
there
were
strange
solemn
notes
like
the
singing
and
a
choir
answered
in
a
deep
rolling
swell
of
sound
and
the
fairies
danced
again
and
i
thought
somehow
of
a
grey
church
high
on
the
cliff
above
a
singing
sea
and
the
fair
people
outside
dancing
on
the
close
turf
while
the
service
was
going
on
all
the
while
as
i
came
nearer
i
heard
the
sea
waves
and
the
wind
and
the
cry
of
the
seagulls
and
again
the
high
wonderful
chanting
as
if
the
fairies
and
the
rocks
and
the
waves
and
the
wild
birds
were
all
subject
to
that
which
was
being
done
within
the
church
i
wondered
what
it
could
be
and
then
i
saw
there
was
an
old
ragged
man
sitting
on
the
seat
under
the
tree
playing
the
fiddle
all
to
himself
and
rocking
from
side
to
side
he
stopped
directly
he
saw
me
and
said
now
would
your
young
honour
do
yourself
the
pleasure
of
giving
the
poor
old
fiddler
a
penny
or
maybe
two
for
lupton
is
the
very
hell
of
a
town
altogether
and
when
i
play
to
dirty
rogues
the
reel
of
the
warriors
they
ask
for
something
about
two
obadiahs
the
devil
black
curse
be
on
them
and
it
but
dry
work
playing
to
the
leaf
and
the
green
sod
the
blessing
of
the
holy
saints
be
on
your
honour
now
this
day
and
for
ever
is
but
a
scarcity
of
beer
that
i
have
tasted
for
a
long
day
i
assure
your
honour
i
had
given
him
a
shilling
because
i
thought
his
music
so
wonderful
he
looked
at
me
steadily
as
he
finished
talking
and
his
face
changed
i
thought
he
was
frightened
he
stared
so
oddly
i
asked
him
if
he
was
i
be
forgiven
he
said
speaking
quite
gravely
without
that
wheedling
way
he
had
when
he
first
spoke
i
be
forgiven
for
talking
so
to
one
like
yourself
for
this
day
i
have
begged
money
from
one
that
is
to
gain
red
martyrdom
and
indeed
that
is
yourself
he
took
off
his
old
battered
hat
and
crossed
himself
and
i
stared
at
him
i
was
so
amazed
at
what
he
said
he
picked
up
his
fiddle
and
saying
you
remember
me
in
the
time
of
your
glory
he
walked
quickly
off
going
away
from
lupton
and
i
lost
sight
of
him
at
the
turn
of
the
road
i
suppose
he
was
half
crazy
but
he
played
wonderfully
iv
i
the
materials
for
the
history
of
an
odd
episode
in
ambrose
life
are
to
be
found
in
a
sort
of
collection
he
made
under
the
title
concerning
gaiety
the
episode
in
question
dates
from
about
the
middle
of
his
eighteenth
year
i
do
not
know
he
says
how
it
all
happened
i
had
been
leading
two
eager
lives
on
the
outside
i
was
playing
games
and
going
up
in
the
school
with
a
rush
and
in
the
inside
i
was
being
gathered
more
and
more
into
the
sanctuaries
of
immortal
things
all
life
was
transfigured
for
me
into
a
radiant
glory
into
a
quickening
and
catholic
sacrament
and
the
fooleries
of
the
school
apart
i
had
more
and
more
the
sense
that
i
was
a
participant
in
a
splendid
and
significant
ritual
i
think
i
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
impatient
with
the
outward
signs
i
i
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
a
pity
that
one
had
to
drink
wine
out
of
a
cup
a
pity
that
kernels
seemed
to
imply
shells
i
wanted
in
my
heart
to
know
nothing
but
the
wine
itself
flowing
gloriously
from
vague
invisible
fountains
to
know
the
things
really
are
in
their
naked
beauty
without
their
various
and
elaborate
draperies
i
doubt
whether
ruskin
understood
the
motive
of
the
monk
who
walked
amidst
the
mountains
with
his
eyes
cast
down
lest
he
might
see
the
depths
and
heights
about
him
ruskin
calls
this
a
narrow
asceticism
perhaps
it
was
rather
the
result
of
a
very
subtle
aestheticism
the
monk
inner
vision
might
be
fixed
with
such
rapture
on
certain
invisible
heights
and
depths
that
he
feared
lest
the
sight
of
their
visible
counterparts
might
disturb
his
ecstasy
it
is
probable
i
think
that
there
is
a
point
where
the
ascetic
principle
and
the
aesthetic
become
one
and
the
same
the
indian
fakir
who
distorts
his
limbs
and
lies
on
spikes
is
at
the
one
extreme
the
men
of
the
italian
renaissance
were
at
the
other
in
each
case
the
true
line
is
distorted
and
awry
for
neither
system
attains
either
sanctity
or
beauty
in
the
highest
the
fakir
dwells
in
and
the
renaissance
artist
dwelt
in
in
neither
case
is
there
the
inexpressible
radiance
of
the
invisible
world
shining
through
the
surfaces
a
cup
of
cellini
work
is
no
doubt
very
lovely
but
it
is
not
beautiful
in
the
same
way
as
the
old
celtic
cups
are
beautiful
i
think
i
was
in
some
danger
of
going
wrong
at
the
time
i
am
talking
about
i
was
altogether
too
impatient
of
surfaces
heaven
forbid
the
notion
that
i
was
ever
in
danger
of
being
in
any
sense
of
the
word
a
protestant
but
perhaps
i
was
rather
inclined
to
the
fundamental
heresy
on
which
protestantism
builds
its
objection
to
what
is
called
ritual
i
suppose
this
heresy
is
really
manichee
it
is
a
charge
of
corruption
and
evil
made
against
the
visible
universe
which
is
affirmed
to
be
not
good
but
bad
or
at
all
events
too
bad
to
be
used
as
the
vehicle
of
spiritual
truth
it
is
extraordinary
by
the
way
that
the
thinking
protestant
does
not
perceive
that
this
principle
damns
all
creeds
and
all
bibles
and
all
teaching
quite
as
effectually
as
it
damns
candles
and
chasubles
unless
indeed
the
protestant
thinks
that
the
logical
understanding
is
a
competent
vehicle
of
eternal
truth
and
that
god
can
be
properly
and
adequately
defined
and
explained
in
human
speech
if
he
thinks
he
is
an
ass
incense
vestments
candles
all
ceremonies
processions
rites
all
these
things
are
miserably
inadequate
but
they
do
not
abound
in
the
horrible
pitfalls
misapprehensions
errors
which
are
inseparable
from
speech
of
men
used
as
an
expression
of
the
church
in
a
savage
dance
there
may
be
a
vast
deal
more
of
the
truth
than
in
many
of
the
hymns
in
our
after
all
as
martinez
said
we
must
even
be
content
with
what
we
have
whether
it
be
censers
or
syllogisms
or
both
the
way
of
the
censer
is
certainly
the
safer
as
i
have
said
i
suppose
because
the
ruin
of
the
external
universe
is
not
nearly
so
deep
nor
so
virulent
as
the
ruin
of
men
a
flower
a
piece
of
gold
no
doubt
approach
their
archetypes
what
they
were
meant
to
be
much
more
nearly
than
man
does
hence
their
appeal
is
purer
than
the
speech
or
the
reasoning
of
men
but
in
those
days
at
lupton
my
head
was
full
of
certain
sentences
which
i
had
lit
upon
somewhere
or
other
i
believe
they
must
have
been
translations
from
some
eastern
book
i
knew
about
a
dozen
of
these
maxims
all
i
can
remember
now
are
you
desire
to
be
inebriated
abstain
from
you
desire
beauty
look
not
on
beautiful
you
desire
to
see
let
your
eyes
be
you
desire
love
refrain
from
the
i
expect
the
paradox
of
these
sayings
pleased
me
one
must
allow
that
if
one
has
the
inborn
appetite
of
the
somewhat
subtle
of
the
truth
not
too
crudely
and
barely
expressed
there
is
no
such
atmosphere
as
that
of
a
public
school
for
sharpening
this
appetite
to
an
edge
of
ravening
indiscriminate
hunger
think
of
our
friend
the
colonel
who
is
by
way
of
being
a
imagine
him
fixed
in
a
where
the
meals
are
a
repeating
cycle
of
irish
stew
boiled
rabbit
cold
mutton
and
salt
cod
without
oyster
or
any
other
sause
then
let
him
out
and
place
him
in
the
caf√©
anglais
with
what
a
fierce
relish
would
he
set
tooth
into
curious
and
dishes
it
must
be
remembered
that
i
listened
every
sunday
in
every
term
to
one
of
the
doctor
sermons
and
it
is
really
not
strange
that
i
gave
an
eager
ear
to
the
voice
of
as
i
think
the
book
was
called
at
any
rate
i
kept
nelly
foran
at
a
distance
for
nine
or
ten
months
and
when
i
saw
a
splendid
sunset
i
averted
my
eyes
i
longed
for
a
love
purely
spiritual
for
a
sunset
of
vision
i
caught
glimpses
too
i
think
of
a
much
more
profound
than
this
i
suppose
you
have
the
in
its
simplest
most
rationalised
form
in
the
case
of
bill
the
i
forget
in
what
great
work
of
i
found
the
instance
perhaps
bill
was
really
in
the
original
and
his
occupation
stated
as
that
of
at
all
events
bill
is
fond
of
but
he
had
perceived
that
two
pots
of
this
beverage
consumed
before
a
professional
journey
tended
to
make
him
rather
sleepy
rather
less
alert
than
he
might
be
in
the
execution
of
his
very
responsible
duties
hence
bill
considering
this
wisely
contents
himself
with
pot
before
mounting
on
his
cab
he
has
deprived
himself
of
a
sensible
good
in
order
that
an
equally
sensible
but
greater
good
may
be
secured
in
order
that
he
and
the
passengers
may
run
no
risks
on
the
journey
next
to
this
simple
asceticism
comes
i
suppose
the
ordinary
discipline
of
the
church
the
abandonment
of
sensible
goods
to
secure
spiritual
ends
the
turning
away
from
the
type
to
the
prototype
from
the
sight
of
the
eyes
to
the
vision
of
the
soul
for
in
the
true
asceticism
whatever
its
degree
there
is
always
action
to
a
certain
end
to
a
perceived
good
does
the
fakir
act
from
this
motive
i
do
know
but
if
he
does
not
his
discipline
is
not
asceticism
at
all
but
folly
and
impious
folly
too
if
he
mortifies
himself
merely
for
the
sake
of
mortifying
himself
then
he
defiles
and
blasphemes
the
temple
this
in
parenthesis
but
as
i
say
i
had
a
very
dim
and
distant
glimpse
of
another
region
of
the
mystics
will
understand
me
when
i
say
that
there
are
moments
when
the
dark
night
of
the
soul
is
seen
to
be
brighter
than
her
brightest
day
there
are
moments
when
it
is
necessary
to
drive
away
even
the
angels
that
there
may
be
place
for
the
highest
one
may
ascend
into
regions
so
remote
from
the
common
concerns
of
life
that
it
becomes
difficult
to
procure
the
help
of
analogy
even
in
the
terms
and
processes
of
the
arts
but
suppose
a
painter
i
need
not
say
that
i
mean
an
artist
who
is
visited
by
an
idea
so
wonderful
so
in
its
beauty
that
he
recognises
his
impotence
he
knows
that
no
pigments
and
no
technique
can
do
anything
but
grossly
parody
his
vision
well
he
will
show
his
greatness
by
attempting
to
paint
that
vision
he
will
write
on
a
bare
canvass
anima
sed
non
pinxit
and
i
am
sure
that
there
are
many
romances
which
have
never
been
written
it
was
a
highly
paradoxical
even
a
dangerous
philosophy
that
affirmed
god
to
be
rather
than
but
there
are
moods
in
which
one
appreciates
the
thought
i
think
i
caught
as
i
say
a
distant
vision
of
that
night
which
excels
the
day
in
its
splendour
it
began
with
the
eyes
turned
away
from
the
sunset
with
lips
that
refused
kisses
then
there
came
a
command
to
the
heart
to
cease
from
longing
for
the
dear
land
of
gwent
to
cease
from
that
aching
desire
that
had
never
died
for
so
many
years
for
the
sight
of
the
old
land
and
those
hills
and
woods
of
most
sweet
and
anguished
memory
i
remember
once
when
i
was
a
great
lout
of
sixteen
i
went
to
see
the
lupton
fair
i
always
liked
the
great
booths
and
caravans
and
all
a
blaze
of
barbaric
green
and
red
and
gold
flaming
and
glowing
in
the
middle
of
the
trampled
sodden
field
against
a
background
of
lupton
and
wet
grey
autumn
sky
there
were
country
folk
then
who
wore
and
looked
like
men
in
them
too
one
saw
scores
of
these
brave
fellows
at
the
fair
dull
good
jutes
with
flaxen
hair
that
was
almost
white
and
with
broad
pink
faces
i
liked
to
see
them
in
the
white
robe
and
the
curious
embroidery
they
were
a
note
of
wholesomeness
an
embassage
from
the
old
english
village
life
to
our
filthy
centre
it
was
odd
to
see
how
they
stared
about
them
they
wondered
i
think
at
the
beastliness
of
the
place
and
yet
poor
fellows
they
felt
bound
to
admire
the
evidence
of
so
much
money
yes
they
were
of
old
england
they
savoured
of
the
long
bending
broad
village
street
the
gable
ends
the
grave
fronts
of
old
mellow
bricks
the
thatched
roofs
here
and
there
the
bulging
window
of
the
shop
the
old
church
in
decorous
somewhat
dull
perpendicular
among
the
elms
and
above
all
the
old
tavern
that
excellent
abode
of
honest
mirth
and
honest
beer
relic
of
the
time
when
there
were
men
and
men
who
lupton
is
very
far
removed
from
hardy
land
and
yet
as
i
think
of
these
in
their
all
the
essence
of
hardy
is
distilled
for
me
i
see
the
village
street
all
white
in
snow
a
light
gleaming
very
rarely
from
an
upper
window
and
presently
amid
ringing
bells
one
hears
the
begin
adam
fall
o
thou
and
i
love
to
look
at
the
whirl
of
the
at
the
people
sitting
with
grave
enjoyment
on
those
absurd
horses
as
they
circle
round
and
round
till
one
eyes
were
dazed
drums
beat
and
thundered
strange
horns
blew
raucous
calls
from
all
quarters
and
the
mechanical
music
to
which
those
horses
revolved
belched
and
blazed
and
rattled
out
its
everlasting
monotony
checked
now
and
again
by
the
shriek
of
the
steam
whistle
groaning
into
silence
for
a
while
then
the
tune
clanged
out
once
more
and
the
horses
whirled
round
and
round
but
on
this
fair
day
of
which
i
am
speaking
i
left
the
booths
and
the
golden
gleaming
for
the
next
field
where
horses
were
excited
to
brief
madness
and
short
energy
i
had
scarcely
taken
up
my
stand
when
a
man
close
by
me
raised
his
voice
to
a
genial
shout
as
he
saw
a
friend
a
little
way
off
and
he
spoke
with
the
beloved
accent
of
gwent
with
those
tones
that
come
to
me
more
ravishing
more
enchanting
than
all
the
music
in
the
world
i
had
not
heard
them
for
years
of
weary
exile
just
a
phrase
or
two
of
common
greeting
in
those
chanting
accents
the
fair
passed
away
was
whirled
into
nothingness
its
shouting
voices
the
charging
of
horses
drum
and
trumpet
clanging
metallic
music
it
rushed
down
into
the
abyss
there
was
the
silence
that
follows
a
great
peal
of
thunder
it
was
early
morning
and
i
was
standing
in
a
valley
beside
the
blossoming
thorn
bush
looking
far
away
to
the
wooded
hills
that
kept
the
east
above
the
course
of
the
shining
river
i
was
i
say
a
great
lout
of
sixteen
but
the
tears
flooded
my
eyes
my
heart
swelled
with
its
longing
now
it
seemed
i
was
to
quell
such
thoughts
as
these
to
desire
no
more
the
fervent
sunlight
on
the
mountain
or
the
sweet
scent
of
the
dusk
about
the
runnings
of
the
brook
i
had
been
very
fond
of
for
walks
walks
of
the
imagination
i
was
afraid
i
suppose
that
unless
by
constant
meditation
i
renewed
the
shape
of
the
old
land
in
my
mind
its
image
might
become
a
blurred
and
fading
picture
i
should
forget
little
by
little
the
ways
of
those
deep
winding
lanes
that
took
courses
that
were
almost
subterranean
over
hill
and
vale
by
woodside
and
waterside
narrow
cavernous
cool
in
the
greatest
heats
of
summer
and
the
wandering
paths
that
crossed
the
fields
that
led
one
down
into
places
hidden
and
remote
into
still
depths
where
no
one
save
myself
ever
seemed
to
enter
that
sometimes
ended
with
a
certain
solemnity
at
a
broken
stile
in
a
hedgerow
grown
into
a
thicket
within
a
plum
tree
returning
to
the
savage
life
of
the
wood
a
forest
perhaps
of
blue
lupins
and
a
great
wild
rose
about
the
ruined
walls
of
a
house
all
these
ways
i
must
keep
in
mind
as
if
they
were
mysteries
and
great
secrets
as
indeed
they
were
so
i
strolled
in
memory
through
the
pageant
of
gwent
i
should
forget
the
region
of
the
flowers
lest
i
should
become
unmindful
of
the
wells
and
the
floods
but
the
time
came
as
i
say
when
it
was
represented
to
me
that
all
this
was
an
indulgence
which
for
a
season
at
least
must
be
pretermitted
with
an
effort
i
voided
my
soul
of
memory
and
desire
and
weeping
when
the
idols
of
doomed
and
great
mynydd
maen
and
the
silver
esses
of
the
usk
appeared
before
me
i
cast
them
out
i
would
not
meditate
white
caerleon
shining
across
the
river
i
endured
i
think
the
severest
pains
de
quincey
that
admirable
artist
that
searcher
into
secrets
and
master
of
mysteries
has
described
my
pains
for
me
under
the
figure
of
the
opium
eater
breaking
the
bonds
of
his
vice
how
often
when
the
abominations
of
lupton
its
sham
energies
its
sham
morals
its
sham
enthusiasms
all
its
battalia
of
cant
surged
and
beat
upon
me
have
i
been
sorely
tempted
to
yield
to
suffer
no
more
the
press
of
folly
but
to
steal
away
by
a
secret
path
i
knew
to
dwell
in
a
secure
valley
where
the
foolish
could
never
trouble
me
sometimes
i
as
i
drank
deep
then
of
the
magic
and
went
astray
in
the
green
dells
and
avenues
of
the
wildwood
still
i
struggled
to
refrain
my
heart
from
these
things
to
keep
my
spirit
under
the
severe
discipline
of
abstention
and
with
a
constant
effort
i
succeeded
more
and
more
but
there
was
a
yet
deeper
depth
in
this
process
of
i
have
said
that
sometimes
one
must
expel
the
angels
that
god
may
have
room
and
now
the
strict
ordinance
was
given
that
i
should
sever
myself
from
that
great
dream
of
celtic
sanctity
that
for
me
had
always
been
dream
the
innermost
shrine
in
which
i
could
take
refuge
the
house
of
sovran
medicaments
where
all
the
wounds
of
soul
and
body
were
healed
one
does
not
wish
to
be
harsh
we
must
admit
i
suppose
that
moderate
sensible
anglicanism
must
have
in
it
since
the
absolute
sham
can
not
very
well
continue
to
exist
let
us
say
then
that
it
is
highly
favourable
to
a
respectable
and
moral
life
that
it
encourages
a
temperate
and
spirit
of
devotion
it
was
certainly
a
very
excellent
and
according
to
her
lights
devout
woman
who
in
her
version
of
the
altered
me
to
me
and
it
was
a
good
cleric
who
hated
the
vulgate
reading
meus
my
father
had
always
instructed
me
that
we
must
conform
outwardly
and
bear
with
beloved
while
we
celebrated
in
our
hearts
the
ancient
mass
of
the
britons
and
waited
for
cadwaladr
to
return
i
reverenced
his
teaching
i
still
reverence
it
and
agree
that
we
must
conform
but
in
my
heart
i
have
always
doubted
whether
moderate
anglicanism
be
christianity
in
any
sense
whether
it
even
deserves
to
be
called
a
religion
at
all
i
do
not
doubt
of
course
that
many
truly
religious
people
have
professed
it
i
speak
of
the
system
and
of
the
atmosphere
which
emanates
from
it
and
when
the
public
school
is
added
to
this
well
the
resultant
teaching
comes
pretty
much
to
the
dogma
that
heaven
and
the
head
are
strict
allies
one
must
not
degenerate
into
ecclesiastical
controversy
i
merely
want
to
say
that
i
never
dreamed
of
looking
for
religion
in
our
chapel
services
no
doubt
the
was
the
te
but
the
noblest
of
hymns
is
degraded
obscured
defiled
made
ridiculous
if
you
marry
it
to
a
tune
that
would
disgrace
a
penny
gaff
personally
i
think
that
the
airs
on
the
are
much
more
reverend
compositions
than
anglican
chants
and
i
am
sure
that
many
popular
hymn
tunes
are
vastly
inferior
in
solemnity
to
dunno
where
no
the
religion
that
led
me
and
drew
me
and
compelled
me
was
that
wonderful
and
doubtful
mythos
of
the
celtic
church
it
was
the
study
nay
more
than
the
study
the
enthusiasm
of
my
father
life
and
as
i
was
literally
baptized
with
water
from
a
holy
well
so
spiritually
the
great
legend
of
the
saints
and
their
amazing
lives
had
tinged
all
my
dearest
aspirations
had
become
to
me
the
glowing
vestment
of
the
great
mystery
one
may
sometimes
be
deeply
interested
in
the
matter
of
a
tale
while
one
is
wearied
or
sickened
by
the
manner
of
it
one
may
have
to
embrace
the
bright
divinity
on
the
horrid
lips
of
the
serpent
of
or
on
the
other
hand
the
manner
the
style
may
be
admirable
and
the
matter
a
mere
nothing
but
a
ground
for
the
embroidery
but
for
me
the
celtic
mythos
was
the
perfect
thing
the
king
daughter
gloria
ejus
fili√¶
regis
ab
intus
in
fimbriis
aureis
circumamicta
i
have
learned
much
more
of
this
great
mystery
since
those
days
i
have
seen
that
is
how
entirely
how
absolutely
my
boyhood
faith
was
justified
but
even
then
with
but
little
knowledge
i
was
rapt
at
the
thought
of
this
marvellous
of
this
christianity
which
was
not
a
moral
code
with
some
sort
of
metaphorical
heaven
held
out
as
a
reward
for
its
due
observance
but
a
great
mystical
adventure
into
the
unknown
sanctity
imagine
a
bishop
of
the
established
church
getting
into
a
boat
without
oar
or
sails
imagine
him
if
you
can
doing
anything
remotely
analagous
to
such
an
action
conceive
the
late
archbishop
tait
going
apart
into
the
chapel
at
lambeth
for
three
days
and
three
nights
then
you
may
well
conceive
the
people
in
the
opposite
bank
being
dazzled
with
the
blinding
supernatural
light
poured
forth
from
the
chapel
windows
of
course
the
end
of
the
celtic
church
was
ruin
and
confusion
but
don
quixote
failed
and
fell
while
sancho
panza
lived
a
fat
prosperous
peasant
he
inherited
i
think
a
considerable
sum
from
the
knight
and
was
no
doubt
a
good
deal
looked
up
to
in
the
village
yes
the
celtic
church
was
the
company
of
the
great
errantry
of
the
great
mystery
and
though
all
the
history
of
it
seems
but
a
dim
and
shadowy
splendour
its
burning
lamp
yet
glows
for
a
few
and
from
my
earliest
childhood
i
was
indoctrinated
in
the
great
rite
of
when
i
was
still
very
young
i
had
been
humoured
with
the
sight
of
a
wonderful
relic
of
the
saints
never
shall
i
forget
that
experience
of
the
holy
magic
of
sanctity
every
little
wood
every
rock
and
fountain
and
every
running
stream
of
gwent
were
hallowed
for
me
by
some
mystical
and
entrancing
legend
and
the
thought
of
this
high
spiritual
city
and
its
blessed
congregation
could
in
a
moment
exercise
and
drive
forth
from
me
all
the
ugly
and
foolish
and
gibbering
spectres
that
made
up
the
life
of
that
ugly
and
foolish
place
where
i
was
imprisoned
now
with
a
sorrowful
farewell
i
bade
for
a
brief
time
as
i
hoped
it
would
be
to
this
golden
legend
my
heart
was
emptied
of
its
treasures
and
its
curious
shows
and
the
lights
on
the
altars
were
put
out
and
the
images
were
strictly
veiled
hushed
was
the
chanting
in
the
sovereign
and
perpetual
choir
hidden
were
the
high
hallows
of
the
saints
no
more
did
i
follow
them
to
their
cells
in
the
wild
hills
no
more
did
i
look
from
the
rocks
in
the
west
and
see
them
set
forth
for
avalon
alas
a
great
silence
seemed
to
fall
upon
me
the
silence
of
the
depths
beneath
the
earth
and
with
the
silence
there
was
darkness
only
in
a
hidden
place
there
was
reserved
the
one
taper
the
light
of
conformity
of
a
perfect
submission
that
from
the
very
excess
of
sorrow
and
deprivation
drew
its
secret
but
quintessential
joy
i
am
reminded
now
that
i
look
back
upon
this
great
purgation
of
the
soul
of
the
story
that
i
once
read
of
the
arabic
alchemist
he
came
to
the
caliph
haroun
with
a
strange
and
extravagant
proposal
haroun
sat
in
all
his
splendour
his
viziers
his
chamberlains
his
great
officers
about
him
in
his
golden
court
which
displayed
all
the
wonders
and
superfluities
of
the
east
he
gave
judgment
the
wicked
were
punished
the
virtuous
were
rewarded
god
name
was
exalted
the
prophet
was
venerated
there
came
before
the
commander
of
the
faithful
a
poor
old
man
in
the
poor
and
ragged
robes
of
a
wandering
poet
he
was
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
his
years
and
his
entrance
was
like
the
entrance
of
misery
so
wretched
was
his
appearance
that
one
of
the
chamberlains
who
was
well
acquainted
with
the
poets
could
not
help
quoting
the
verses
the
main
and
a
drop
of
rain
the
difference
seen
is
nothing
great
the
sun
so
bright
and
the
taper
light
are
alike
and
one
save
in
pomp
and
state
in
the
grain
of
sand
and
in
all
the
land
what
may
ye
arraign
as
disparate
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
king
board
spread
will
hunger
lust
alike
abate
with
the
smallest
blade
or
with
host
arrayed
the
ruler
may
quench
his
gall
and
hate
a
stone
in
a
box
and
a
quarry
of
rocks
may
be
shown
to
be
of
an
equal
freight
with
a
sentence
bold
or
with
gold
untold
the
lover
may
hold
or
capture
his
mate
the
king
and
the
bard
may
alike
be
debarred
from
the
fold
of
the
lord
compassionate
the
commander
of
the
faithful
praised
god
the
merciful
the
compassionate
the
king
of
the
day
of
judgment
and
caused
the
chamberlain
to
be
handsomely
rewarded
he
then
enquired
of
the
old
man
for
what
reason
he
came
before
him
and
the
beggar
as
indeed
he
seemed
informed
the
caliph
that
he
had
for
many
years
prosecuted
his
studies
in
magic
alchemy
astrology
and
geomancy
and
all

in

in

where
magicians
were
to
be
found
in
proof
of
his
proficiency
he
produced
a
little
box
which
he
carried
about
him
for
the
purpose
of
his
geomantic
operations
and
asked
anyone
who
was
willing
to
stand
forth
that
he
might
hear
his
whole
life
past
present
and
future
the
caliph
ordered
one
of
his
officers
to
submit
himself
to
this
ordeal
and
the
beggar
having
made
the
points
in
the
sand
and
having
erected
the
figure
according
to
the
rules
of
the
geomantic
art
immediately
informed
the
officer
of
all
the
most
hidden
transactions
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
including
several
matters
which
this
officer
thought
had
been
secrets
locked
in
his
own
breast
he
also
foretold
his
death
in
a
year
time
from
a
certain
herb
and
so
it
fell
out
for
he
was
strangled
with
a
hempen
cord
by
order
of
the
caliph
in
the
meantime
the
commander
of
the
faithful
and
all
about
him
were
astonished
and
the
beggar
magician
was
ordered
to
proceed
with
his
story
he
spoke
at
great
length
and
everyone
remarked
the
elegance
and
propriety
of
his
diction
which
was
wanting
in
no
refinement
of
classical
eloquence
but
the
sum
of
his
speech
was
this
that
he
had
discovered
the
greatest
wonder
of
the
whole
world
the
name
of
which
he
declared
was
asrar
and
by
this
talisman
he
said
that
the
caliph
might
make
himself
more
renowned
than
all
the
kings
that
had
ever
reigned
on
the
earth
not
excepting
king
solomon
the
son
of
david
this
was
the
method
of
the
operation
which
the
beggar
proposed
the
commander
of
the
faithful
was
to
gather
together
all
the
wealth
of
his
entire
kingdom
omitting
nothing
that
could
possibly
be
discovered
and
while
this
was
being
done
the
magician
said
that
he
would
construct
a
furnace
of
peculiar
shape
in
which
all
these
splendours
and
magnificences
and
treasures
of
the
world
must
be
consumed
in
a
certain
fire
of
art
prepared
with
wisdom
and
at
last
he
continued
after
the
operation
had
endured
many
days
the
fire
being
all
the
while
most
curiously
governed
there
would
remain
but
one
drop
no
larger
than
a
pearl
but
glorious
as
the
sun
to
the
moon
and
all
the
starry
heavens
and
the
wonders
of
the
compassionate
and
with
this
drop
the
caliph
haroun
might
heal
all
the
sorrows
of
the
universe
both
the
commander
of
the
faithful
and
all
his
viziers
and
officers
were
stupefied
by
this
proposal
and
most
of
the
assemblage
considered
the
beggar
to
be
a
madman
the
caliph
however
asked
him
to
return
the
next
day
in
order
that
his
plans
might
receive
more
mature
consideration
the
beggar
prostrated
himself
and
went
forth
from
the
hall
of
audience
but
he
returned
no
more
nor
could
it
be
discovered
that
he
had
been
seen
again
by
anyone
one
drop
no
larger
than
a
pearl
and
there
is
nothing
there
is
all
i
have
often
thought
of
those
sentences
in
looking
back
on
that
time
when
as
chesson
said
i
was
one
of
those
and
yet
sturdy
and
reliable
young
fellows
to
whose
hands
the
honour
and
safety
of
england
might
one
day
be
committed
i
cast
all
the
treasures
i
possessed
into
the
alembic
again
and
again
they
were
rectified
by
the
heat
of
the
fire
curiously
governed
i
saw
the
of
the
crow
black
as
pitch
the
flight
of
the
dove
with
silver
wings
and
at
last
sol
rose
red
and
glorious
and
i
fell
down
and
gave
thanks
to
heaven
for
this
most
wonderful
gift
the
blessed
of
the
fire
i
had
dispossessed
myself
of
all
and
i
found
that
i
possessed
all
i
had
thrown
away
all
the
money
in
my
purse
and
i
was
richer
than
i
had
ever
been
i
had
died
and
i
had
found
a
new
life
in
the
land
of
the
living
it
is
curious
that
i
should
now
have
to
explain
the
pertinency
of
all
that
i
have
written
to
the
title
of
this
note
concerning
gaiety
it
should
not
be
necessary
the
chain
of
thought
is
almost
painfully
obvious
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
necessary
well
i
once
read
an
interesting
article
in
the
daily
paper
it
was
written
apropos
of
some
shakespearean
celebrations
or
other
and
its
purport
was
that
modern
england
was
ever
so
much
happier
than
medi√¶val
or
elizabethian
england
it
is
possible
that
an
acute
logician
might
find
something
to
say
on
this
thesis
but
my
interest
lay
in
the
following
passages
which
i
quote
england
with
its
maypoles
and
its
whitsun
ales
and
its
jousts
and
junketings
is
dead
for
us
from
the
religious
point
of
view
the
england
that
has
survived
is
after
all
a
greater
england
still
it
is
puritan
england
the
spirit
has
gone
surely
it
is
useless
to
revive
the
form
wherefore
should
the
may
queen
be
holy
wise
and
fair
if
not
to
symbolise
the
virgin
mary
and
as
for
too
what
point
in
jollity
without
a
fast
to
follow
the
article
is
not
but
i
think
the
writer
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
truth
that
there
is
a
deep
relation
between
mirth
and
sanctity
that
no
real
mirth
is
possible
without
the
apprehension
of
the
mysteries
as
its
antecedent
the
fast
and
the
feast
are
complementary
terms
he
is
right
there
is
no
point
in
jollity
unless
there
is
a
fast
or
something
of
the
nature
of
a
fast
to
follow
though
of
course
there
is
nothing
to
hinder
the
most
advanced
thinker
from
drinking
as
much
and
raw
russian
spirit
as
he
likes
but
the
result
of
this
course
is
not
real
mirth
or
jollity
it
is
perhaps
more
essentially
dismal
than
a
amongst
the
protestant
dissenters
and
on
the
other
hand
true
gaiety
is
only
possible
to
those
who
have
fasted
and
now
perhaps
it
will
be
seen
that
i
have
been
describing
the
preparations
for
a
festival
the
cloud
passed
away
from
me
the
restrictions
and
inhibitions
were
suddenly
removed
and
i
woke
up
one
morning
in
dancing
bubbling
spirits
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
racing
with
new
life
my
nerves
tingling
and
thrilling
with
energy
i
laughed
as
i
awoke
i
was
conscious
that
i
was
to
engage
in
a
strange
and
fantastic
adventure
though
i
had
not
the
remotest
notion
of
what
it
was
to
be
ii
ambrose
meyrick
adventure
was
certainly
of
the
fantastic
order
his
fame
had
long
been
established
on
a
sure
footing
with
his
uncle
and
with
everybody
else
and
horbury
had
congratulated
him
with
genuine
enthusiasm
on
his
work
in
the
examinations
the
summer
term
was
drawing
to
a
close
horbury
was
ambrose
trustee
and
he
made
no
difficulty
about
signing
a
really
handsome
cheque
for
his
nephew
holiday
expenses
and
outfit
there
he
said
you
ought
to
be
able
to
do
pretty
well
on
that
where
do
you
think
of
going
ambrose
said
that
he
had
thought
of
north
devon
of
tramping
over
exmoor
visiting
the
doone
country
and
perhaps
of
working
down
to
dartmoor
you
could
do
better
you
ought
to
try
your
hand
at
fishing
wonderful
sport
in
some
of
those
streams
it
might
come
off
at
first
but
with
your
eye
and
sense
of
distance
you
soon
make
a
fine
angler
if
you
have
a
turn
at
the
trout
get
hold
of
some
local
man
and
make
him
give
you
a
wrinkle
or
two
it
no
good
getting
your
flies
from
town
now
when
i
was
fishing
in
hampshire
horbury
went
on
but
the
devil
of
gaiety
had
already
dictated
a
wonderful
scheme
to
ambrose
and
that
night
he
informed
nelly
foran
that
she
must
alter
her
plans
she
was
to
come
with
him
to
france
instead
of
spending
a
fortnight
at
blackpool
he
carried
out
this
mad
device
with
an
ingenuity
that
poor
palmer
would
certainly
have
called
diabolical
in
the
first
place
there
was
to
be
a
week
in
london
for
nelly
must
have
some
clothes
and
this
week
began
as
an
experience
of
high
delight
it
was
not
devoid
of
terror
for
masters
might
be
abroad
and
ambrose
did
not
wish
to
leave
lupton
for
some
time
however
they
neither
saw
nor
were
seen
arriving
at
pancras
the
luggage
was
left
in
the
station
and
ambrose
who
had
studied
the
map
of
london
stood
for
a
while
on
the
pavement
outside
scott
great
masterpiece
of
architecture
and
considered
the
situation
with
grave
yet
humorous
deliberation
nelly
proved
herself
admirably
worthy
of
the
adventure
its
monstrous
audacity
appealed
to
her
and
she
was
in
a
state
of
perpetual
subdued
laughter
for
some
days
after
their
arrival
meyrick
looked
about
him
and
found
that
the
euston
road
being
squalid
and
noisy
offered
few
attractions
and
with
sudden
resolution
he
took
the
girl
by
the
arm
and
steered
into
the
heart
of
bloomsbury
in
this
charmingly
central
and
yet
retired
quarter
they
found
rooms
in
a
quiet
byway
which
oddly
enough
looked
on
a
green
field
and
under
the
pleasant
style
of
and
lupton
they
partook
of
tea
while
the
luggage
was
fetched
by
somebody
probably
a
husband
who
came
with
a
shock
of
red
untidy
hair
from
the
dark
bowels
of
the
basement
they
screamed
with
mirth
over
the
meal
horbury
had
faults
but
he
kept
a
good
table
for
himself
his
boys
and
his
servants
and
the
exotic
quaint
flavour
of
the
bread
and
butter
seemed
to
these
two
young
idiots
exquisitely
funny
and
the
queer
faint
close
smell
too
of
the
whole
house
it
rushed
out
at
one
when
the
hall
door
was
opened
it
was
heavy
and
worth
its
weight
in
gold
i
never
know
ambrose
used
to
say
afterwards
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
when
i
have
been
away
for
some
time
from
town
and
come
back
and
smell
that
wonderful
old
london
aroma
i
do
believe
it
so
strong
or
so
rare
as
it
used
to
be
i
have
been
disappointed
once
or
twice
in
houses
in
quite
shabby
streets
it
was
of
course
but
well
if
it
were
a
vintage
wine
i
should
say
it
was
a
second
growth
of
a
very
poor
year
margaux
no
doubt
but
a
margaux
of
one
of
those
very
indifferent
years
in
the
early
or
it
may
be
like
the
smell
of
one
does
notice
it
after
a
month
or
two
but
i
think
it
is
still
he
would
go
on
i
value
what
i
can
smell
of
it
it
brings
back
to
me
that
afternoon
that
hot
choking
afternoon
of
ever
so
many
years
ago
it
was
really
tremendously
hot
degrees
i
think
i
saw
in
the
paper
the
next
day
and
when
we
got
out
at
pancras
the
wind
came
at
one
like
a
furnace
blast
there
was
no
sun
visible
the
sky
was
bleary
a
sort
of
sickly
smoky
yellow
and
the
burning
wind
came
in
gusts
and
the
dust
hissed
and
rattled
on
the
pavement
do
you
know
what
a
low
smells
like
in
london
on
a
hot
afternoon
do
you
know
what
london
bitter
tastes
like
on
such
a
day
the
publican
being
evidently
careful
of
his
clients
health
and
aware
of
the
folly
of
drinking
cold
beverages
during
a
period
of
extreme
heat
i
do
nelly
poor
dear
had
warm
lemonade
and
i
had
warm
beer
warm
chemicals
i
mean
but
the
odour
why
does
some
scientific
man
stop
wasting
his
time
over
a
lot
of
useless
rubbish
and
discover
a
way
of
bottling
the
odour
of
the
past
ah
but
if
he
did
so
in
a
phial
of
rare
crystal
with
a
stopper
as
secure
as
the
seal
of
solimaun
ben
daoud
would
i
preserve
one
most
precious
scent
inscribing
on
the
seal
within
a
perfect
pentagram
the
mystic
legend
little
russell
row
the
cat
had
come
in
with
the
he
was
a
black
cat
not
very
large
with
a
decent
roundness
of
feature
and
yet
with
a
suggestion
of
sinewy
skinniness
about
him
the
skinniness
of
the
wastrel
not
of
the
poor
starveling
his
bright
green
eyes
had
as
ambrose
observed
the
wisdom
of
egypt
on
his
tomb
should
be
inscribed
the
justified
in
sekht
he
walked
solemnly
in
front
of
the
landlady
his
body
describing
strange
curves
his
tail
waving
in
the
air
and
his
ears
put
back
with
an
expression
of
intense
cunning
he
seemed
delighted
at
the
let
and
when
nelly
stroked
his
back
he
gave
a
loud
shriek
of
joy
and
made
known
his
willingness
to
take
a
little
refreshment
they
laughed
so
heartily
over
their
tea
that
when
the
landlady
came
in
to
clear
the
things
away
they
were
still
bubbling
over
with
aimless
merriment
i
likes
to
see
young
people
she
said
pleasantly
and
readily
provided
a
latchkey
in
case
they
cared
to
come
in
rather
late
she
told
them
a
good
deal
of
her
life
she
had
kept
lodgings
in
judd
street
near
king
cross
a
nasty
noisy
street
she
called
it
and
she
seemed
to
think
the
inhabitants
a
low
lot
she
had
to
do
with
all
sorts
some
good
some
bad
and
the
business
was
what
it
had
been
in
her
mother
day
they
sat
a
little
while
on
the
sofa
hand
in
hand
still
consumed
with
the
jest
of
their
being
there
at
all
and
imagining
grotesque
entrances
of
horbury
or
chesson
then
they
went
out
to
wander
about
the
streets
to
see
london
easily
merrily
without
bothering
the
monument
or
the
british
museum
or
madame
tussaud
finally
to
get
something
to
eat
they
did
know
when
or
where
or
how
and
they
did
in
the
least
care
there
was
one
sight
they
were
not
successful
in
avoiding
they
had
not
journeyed
far
before
the
great
portal
of
the
british
museum
confronted
them
grandiose
and
gloomy
so
by
the
sober
way
of
great
russell
street
they
made
their
way
into
tottenham
court
road
and
finally
into
oxford
street
the
shops
were
bright
and
splendid
the
pavement
was
crowded
with
a
hurrying
multitude
as
it
seemed
to
the
country
folk
though
it
was
the
dullest
season
of
the
year
it
was
a
great
impression
decidedly
london
was
a
wonderful
place
already
ambrose
felt
a
curious
sense
of
being
at
home
in
it
it
was
not
beautiful
but
it
was
on
the
immense
scale
it
did
something
more
than
vomit
stinks
into
the
air
poison
into
the
water
and
rows
of
houses
on
the
land
they
wandered
on
and
then
they
had
the
fancy
that
they
would
like
to
explore
the
regions
to
the
south
it
was
so
impossible
as
ambrose
said
to
know
where
they
would
find
themselves
eventually
he
carefully
lost
himself
within
a
few
minutes
of
oxford
street
a
few
turnings
to
right
and
then
to
left
the
navigation
of
strange
alleys
soon
left
them
in
the
most
satisfactory
condition
of
bewilderment
the
distinctions
of
the
mariner
compass
its
pedantry
of
east
and
west
north
and
south
were
annihilated
and
had
ceased
to
be
it
was
an
adventure
in
a
trackless
desert
in
the
australian
bush
but
on
safer
ground
and
in
an
infinitely
more
entertaining
scene
at
first
they
had
passed
through
dark
streets
georgian
and
augustan
ways
gloomy
enough
and
half
deserted
there
were
grave
houses
with
many
stories
of
windows
now
reduced
to
printing
offices
to
pickle
warehouses
to
odd
crafts
such
as
those
of
the
metal
assayer
the
crucible
maker
the
engraver
of
seals
the
fabricator
of
boule
but
how
wonderful
it
was
to
see
the
actual
place
where
those
things
were
done
ambrose
had
read
of
such
arts
but
had
always
thought
of
them
as
existing
in
a
vague
void
if
some
of
them
even
existed
at
all
in
those
days
but
there
in
the
windows
were
actual
crucibles
curvilinear
pots
of
ware
the
veritable
instruments
of
the
magnum
opus
inventions
of
arabia
he
was
no
longer
astonished
when
a
little
farther
he
saw
a
harpsichord
which
had
only
been
a
name
to
him
a
beautiful
looking
thing
richly
inlaid
with
its
date
inscribed
on
a
card
above
it
it
was
now
utterly
wonderland
he
could
very
likely
buy
armour
round
the
corner
and
he
had
scarcely
formed
the
thought
when
a
very
fine
suit
richly
damascened
rose
up
before
him
handsomely
displayed
between
two
black
jacks
these
were
the
comparatively
silent
streets
but
they
turned
a
corner
and
what
a
change
all
the
roadway
not
the
pavement
only
seemed
full
of
a
strolling
chatting
laughing
mob
of
people
the
women
were
bareheaded
and
one
heard
nothing
but
the
roll
of
the
french
r
torrents
of
sonorous
sound
trolled
out
with
the
music
of
happy
song
the
papers
in
the
shops
were
all
french
ensigns
on
every
side
proclaimed
vins
fins
beaune
sup√©rieur
the
tobacconists
kept
their
tobacco
in
square
blue
yellow
and
brown
packets
charcuterie
made
a
brave
and
appetising
show
and
here
was
a
caf√©
restaurant
au
ch√¢teau
de
chinon
the
name
was
enough
they
could
not
dine
elsewhere
and
ambrose
felt
that
he
was
honouring
the
memory
of
the
great
rabelais
it
was
probably
not
a
very
good
dinner
it
was
infinitely
better
than
the
soho
dinner
of
these
days
for
the
quarter
had
hardly
begun
to
yield
to
the
attack
of
art
intellect
and
the
suburbs
which
between
them
have
since
destroyed
the
character
and
unction
of
many
a
good
ambrose
only
remembered
two
dishes
the
de
porc
and
the
salad
the
former
he
thought
both
amusing
and
delicious
and
the
latter
was
strangely
and
artfully
compounded
of
many
herbs
of
little
vinegar
of
abundant
proven√ßal
oil
with
the
or
crust
rubbed
with
garlic
reposing
at
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
after
madame
had
tormented
the
ingredients
the
salad
was
a
dish
from
fairyland
there
be
no
such
salads
now
in
all
the
land
of
soho
let
me
celebrate
above
all
the
little
red
wine
says
ambrose
in
a
brief
dithyrambic
note
not
in
any
mortal
vineyard
did
its
father
grape
ripen
it
was
not
nourished
by
the
warmth
of
the
visible
sun
nor
were
the
rains
that
made
it
swell
common
waters
from
the
skies
above
us
not
even
in
the
chinonnais
sacred
earth
though
that
be
was
the
press
made
that
caused
its
juices
to
be
poured
into
the
nor
was
the
humming
of
its
fermentation
heard
in
any
of
the
good
cellars
of
the
lower
touraine
but
in
that
region
which
keats
celebrates
when
he
sings
the
tavern
was
this
juice
engendered
the
vineyard
lay
low
down
in
the
south
among
the
starry
plains
where
is
the
turonensis
that
unimaginable
country
which
rabelais
beheld
in
his
vision
where
mighty
gargantua
drinks
from
inexhaustible
vats
eternally
where
pantagruel
is
athirst
for
evermore
though
he
be
satisfied
continually
there
in
the
land
of
the
crowned
immortal
tosspots
was
that
wine
of
ours
vintaged
red
with
the
rays
of
the
made
magical
by
the
influence
of
venus
fertilised
by
the
happy
aspect
of
mercury
o
rare
superabundant
and
most
excellent
juice
fruit
of
all
fortunate
stars
by
thee
were
we
translated
exalted
into
the
fellowship
of
that
tavern
of
which
the
old
poet
writes
est
propositum
in
taberna
mori
there
were
few
english
people
in
the
ch√¢teau
de
chinon
indeed
it
is
doubtful
whether
there
was
more
than
one
the
m√©nage
lupton
excepted
this
one
compatriot
happened
to
be
a
rather
remarkable
man
it
was
carrol
he
was
not
in
the
vanguard
of
anything
he
knew
no
journalists
and
belonged
to
no
clubs
he
was
not
even
acquainted
in
the
most
distant
manner
with
a
single
person
who
could
be
called
really
influential
or
successful
he
was
an
obscure
literary
worker
who
published
an
odd
volume
every
five
or
six
years
now
and
then
he
got
notices
when
there
was
no
press
of
important
stuff
in
the
offices
and
sometimes
a
kindly
reviewer
predicted
that
he
would
come
out
all
right
in
time
though
he
had
still
much
to
learn
about
a
year
before
he
died
an
intelligent
reading
public
was
told
that
one
or
two
things
of
his
were
rather
good
then
on
his
death
it
was
definitely
discovered
that
the
five
volumes
of
verse
occupied
absolutely
unique
ground
that
a
supreme
poet
had
been
taken
from
us
a
poet
who
had
raised
the
english
language
into
a
fourth
dimension
of
melody
and
magic
the
intelligent
reading
public
read
him
no
more
than
they
ever
did
but
they
buy
him
in
edition
after
edition
from
large
quarto
to
post
octavo
they
buy
him
put
up
into
little
decorated
boxes
they
buy
him
on
japanese
vellum
they
buy
him
illustrated
by
six
different
artists
they
discuss
no
end
of
articles
about
him
they
write
their
names
in
the
carrol
birthday
book
they
set
up
the
carrol
calendar
in
their
boudoirs
they
have
quotations
from
him
in
westminster
abbey
and
paul
cathedral
they
sing
him
in
the
famous
carrol
cycle
of
song
and
last
and
best
of
all
a
brilliant
american
playwright
is
talking
even
now
of
dramatising
him
the
carrol
club
of
course
is
ancient
history
its
membership
is
confined
to
the
ranks
of
intellect
and
art
it
invites
to
its
dinners
foreign
princes
bankers
and
other
persons
of
distinction
all
of
whom
of
course
are
intensely
interested
in
the
master
book
and
the
record
and
praise
of
the
club
are
in
all
the
papers
it
is
a
pity
that
carrol
is
dead
he
would
not
have
sworn
he
would
have
grinned
even
then
though
he
was
not
glorious
he
was
observant
and
he
left
a
brief
note
a
sort
of
sketch
of
his
impressions
that
night
at
the
ch√¢teau
de
chinon
i
was
sitting
in
my
old
corner
he
says
wondering
why
the
devil
i
wrote
so
badly
on
the
whole
and
what
the
devil
i
was
going
to
do
with
the
subject
that
i
had
tackled
the
dinner
was
not
so
bad
at
the
old
ch√¢teau
in
those
days
though
now
they
say
the
is
the
best
dish
in
the
establishment
i
liked
the
old
place
it
was
dingy
and
low
down
and
rather
disreputable
i
fancy
and
the
company
was
miscellaneous
french
with
a
dash
of
italian
nearly
all
of
us
knew
each
other
and
there
were
regulars
who
sat
in
the
same
seat
night
after
night
i
liked
it
all
i
liked
the
coarse
tablecloths
and
the
knives
and
the
lead
spoons
and
the
damp
adhesive
salt
and
the
coarse
strong
black
pepper
that
one
helped
with
a
fork
handle
then
there
was
madame
sitting
on
high
and
i
never
saw
an
uglier
woman
nor
a
more
i
was
getting
through
my
roast
fowl
and
salad
that
evening
when
two
wonderful
people
came
in
obviously
from
fairyland
i
saw
they
had
never
been
in
such
a
place
in
all
their
lives
before
i
do
believe
either
of
them
had
set
foot
in
london
until
that
day
and
their
wonder
and
delight
and
enjoyment
of
it
all
were
so
enormous
that
i
had
another
helping
of
food
and
an
extra
of
wine
i
enjoyed
them
too
in
their
way
but
i
could
see
that
fowl
and
wine
were
not
a
bit
the
same
as
mine
once
knew
the
restaurant
they
were
really
dining
at
grand
caf√©
de
paradis
some
such
name
as
that
he
was
an
extraordinary
looking
chap
quite
young
i
should
fancy
black
hair
dark
skin
and
such
burning
eyes
i
do
know
why
but
i
felt
he
was
a
bit
out
of
his
setting
and
i
kept
thinking
how
i
should
like
to
see
him
in
a
monk
robe
madame
was
different
she
was
a
lovely
girl
with
amazing
copper
hair
dressed
rather
badly
of
the
people
i
should
imagine
but
what
a
gaiety
she
had
i
could
hear
what
they
were
saying
but
one
had
to
smile
with
sheer
joy
at
the
sight
of
her
face
it
positively
danced
with
mirth
and
a
good
musician
could
have
set
it
to
music
i
am
sure
there
was
something
a
little
queer
too
pronounced
perhaps
about
the
lower
part
of
her
face
perhaps
it
would
have
been
an
odd
tune
but
i
know
i
should
have
liked
to
hear
it
ambrose
lit
a
black
caporal
cigarette
he
had
bought
a
packet
on
his
way
he
saw
an
enticing
bottle
of
rotund
form
paying
its
visits
to
some
neighbouring
tables
and
the
happy
fools
made
the
acquaintance
of
benedictine
oh
yes
it
is
all
very
well
ambrose
has
been
heard
to
say
on
being
offered
this
agreeable
and
aromatic
liqueur
it
nice
enough
i
daresay
but
you
should
have
tasted
the
stuff
i
got
it
at
a
little
cafe
in
soho
some
years
ago
the
ch√¢teau
de
chinon
no
it
no
good
going
there
now
it
quite
different
all
the
walls
are
and
gold
the
head
waiter
is
called
ma√Ætre
and
i
am
told
it
quite
the
thing
both
in
southern
and
northern
suburbs
to
make
up
dinner
parties
at
the
ch√¢teau
everything
most
correct
evening
dress
fans
opera
cloaks
champagne
and
stalls
afterwards
one
gets
a
glimpse
of
bohemian
life
that
way
and
everybody
says
been
such
a
queer
evening
but
quite
amusing
too
but
you
ca
get
the
real
benedictine
there
now
where
can
you
get
it
ah
i
wish
i
knew
never
come
across
it
the
bottle
looks
just
the
same
but
it
quite
a
different
flavour
the
phylloxera
may
be
responsible
of
course
but
i
do
think
it
is
perhaps
the
bottle
that
went
round
the
table
that
night
was
like
the
powder
in
and
its
properties
were
the
result
of
some
strange
accident
at
all
events
they
were
quite
magical
the
two
adventurers
went
forth
into
the
maze
of
streets
and
lost
themselves
again
heaven
knows
where
they
went
by
what
ways
they
wandered
as
with
eyes
arm
locked
in
arm
they
gazed
on
an
enchanted
scene
which
they
knew
must
be
london
and
nothing
else
what
else
could
it
be
indeed
now
and
again
ambrose
thought
he
recognized
certain
features
and
monuments
and
public
places
of
which
he
had
read
but
still
that
wine
of
the
ch√¢teau
was
by
all
mundane
reckonings
of
the
smallest
and
one
little
glass
of
benedictine
with
coffee
could
not
disturb
the
weakest
head
yet
was
it
london
after
all
what
they
saw
was
doubtless
the
common
world
of
the
streets
and
squares
the
gay
ways
and
the
dull
the
broad
ringing
lighted
roads
and
the
dark
echoing
passages
yet
they
saw
it
all
as
one
sees
a
mystery
play
through
a
veil
but
the
veil
before
their
eyes
was
a
transmuting
vision
and
its
substance
was
shot
as
if
it
were
samite
with
wonderful
and
admirable
golden
ornaments
in
the
eastern
tales
people
find
themselves
thus
suddenly
transported
into
an
unknown
magical
territory
with
cities
that
are
altogether
things
of
marvel
and
enchantment
whose
walls
are
pure
gold
lighted
by
the
shining
of
incomparable
jewels
and
ambrose
declared
later
that
never
till
that
evening
had
he
realized
the
extraordinary
and
absolute
truth
to
nature
of
the
those
who
were
present
on
a
certain
occasion
will
not
soon
forget
his
rejoinder
to
a
gentleman
in
the
company
who
said
that
for
truth
to
nature
he
went
to
george
eliot
i
was
speaking
of
men
and
women
sir
was
the
answer
not
of
lice
the
gentleman
in
question
who
was
quite
an
influential
man
some
whisper
that
he
was
an
editor
was
naturally
very
much
annoyed
still
ambrose
maintained
his
position
he
would
even
affirm
that
for
crude
realism
the
eastern
tales
were
absolutely
unique
of
course
he
said
i
take
realism
to
mean
absolute
and
essential
truthfulness
of
description
as
opposed
to
merely
conventional
treatment
zola
is
a
realist
not
as
the
imbeciles
suppose
because
he
described
well
rather
minutely
many
unpleasant
sights
and
sounds
and
smells
and
emotions
but
because
he
was
a
poet
a
seer
because
in
spite
of
his
his
cheap
materialisms
he
saw
the
true
heart
the
reality
of
things
take
do
you
think
it
is
because
it
describes
minutely
and
probably
faithfully
the
event
of
a
cow
calving
not
in
the
least
the
local
vet
who
was
called
in
could
probably
do
all
that
as
well
or
better
it
is
because
it
goes
behind
all
the
brutalities
all
the
piggeries
and
inhumanities
of
those
frightful
people
and
shows
us
the
strange
mad
transcendent
passion
that
lay
behind
all
those
things
the
wild
desire
for
the
land
a
longing
that
burned
that
devoured
that
inflamed
that
drove
men
to
hell
and
death
as
would
a
passion
for
a
goddess
who
might
never
be
attained
remember
how
beauce
is
personified
how
the
earth
swells
and
quickens
before
one
how
every
clod
and
morsel
of
the
soil
cries
for
its
service
and
its
sacrifice
and
its
victims
i
call
realism
the
is
also
profoundly
realistic
though
both
the
and
the
method
of
treatment
the
technique
are
very
different
from
the
and
the
technique
of
zola
of
course
there
may
be
people
who
think
that
if
you
describe
a
pigsty
well
you
are
a
and
if
you
describe
an
altar
well
you
are
i
do
not
know
that
the
mental
processes
of
cr√©tins
form
a
very
interesting
subject
for
discussion
one
may
surmise
if
one
will
that
the
sudden
violence
of
the
change
was
a
sufficient
cause
of
exaltation
that
detestable
lupton
left
behind
no
town
but
a
collection
of
stink
and
poison
factories
and
slave
quarters
that
more
detestable
school
more
ridiculous
than
the
academy
of
lagado
that
most
detestable
routine
games
lessons
and
the
sermons
the
transition
was
tremendous
to
the
freedom
of
fabled
london
of
the
unknown
streets
and
unending
multitudes
ambrose
said
he
hesitated
to
talk
of
that
walk
lest
he
should
be
thought
an
aimless
liar
they
strolled
for
hours
seeing
the
most
wonderful
things
the
most
wonderful
people
but
he
declared
that
the
case
was
similar
to
that
of
the
benedictine
he
could
never
discover
again
the
regions
that
he
had
perambulated
somewhere
he
said
close
to
the
ch√¢teau
de
chinon
there
must
be
a
passage
which
had
since
been
blocked
up
by
it
was
the
entrance
to
fairyland
when
at
last
they
found
little
russell
row
the
black
cat
was
awaiting
them
with
an
expression
which
was
pleased
and
pious
too
he
had
devoured
the
greater
portion
of
that
of
dubious
butter
ambrose
smoked
black
cigarettes
in
bed
till
the
packet
was
finished
iii
it
was
an
amazing
week
they
spent
in
london
for
a
couple
of
days
nelly
was
busied
in
getting
things
and
odds
and
ends
and
to
her
credit
she
dressed
the
part
most
admirably
she
abjured
all
the
imperial
purples
the
mediterranean
blues
the
shrieking
lilacs
that
her
class
usually
affects
and
appeared
at
last
a
model
of
neat
gaiety
in
the
meantime
while
these
shopping
expeditions
were
in
progress
while
nelly
consulted
with
those
tall
and
awful
elegances
which
preside
over
the
last
mysteries
of
the
draper
and
milliner
ambrose
sat
at
home
in
little
russell
row
and
worked
out
the
outlines
of
some
fantasies
that
had
risen
in
his
mind
it
was
in
fact
during
these
days
that
he
made
the
notes
which
were
afterwards
expanded
into
the
curious
of
a
book
which
is
now
rare
and
sought
after
by
collectors
it
is
supposed
that
it
was
this
work
that
was
in
poor
palmer
mind
when
the
earnest
man
referred
with
a
sort
of
gloomy
reticence
to
meyrick
later
career
he
had
in
all
probability
not
read
a
line
of
it
but
the
title
was
certainly
not
a
very
pleasing
one
judged
by
ordinary
scholastic
standards
and
it
must
be
said
that
the
critical
reception
of
the
book
was
not
exactly
encouraging
one
paper
wondered
candidly
why
such
a
book
was
ever
written
or
printed
another
denounced
the
author
in
good
set
terms
as
an
enemy
of
the
great
temperance
movement
while
a
third
a
monthly
reviewer
declared
that
the
work
made
his
blood
boil
yet
even
the
severest
moralists
should
have
seen
by
the
epigraph
that
the
apes
and
owls
and
antiques
hid
mysteries
of
some
sort
since
a
writer
whose
purposes
were
really
evil
and
intemperate
would
never
have
chosen
such
a
motto
as
praised
the
behaviour
of
the
inebriated
and
drank
water
from
the
but
the
reviewers
thought
that
this
was
unintelligible
nonsense
and
merely
a
small
part
of
the
writer
general
purpose
to
annoy
the
rough
sketch
is
contained
in
the
first
of
the
which
are
still
unpublished
and
perhaps
are
likely
to
remain
so
meyrick
jotted
down
his
hints
and
ideas
in
the
dingy
first
floor
front
of
the
bloomsbury
sitting
at
the
rosewood
davenport
which
to
the
landlady
seemed
the
last
word
in
beautiful
furniture
the
m√©nage
rose
late
what
a
relief
it
was
to
be
free
of
the
horrible
bells
that
poisoned
one
rest
at
lupton
to
lie
in
peace
as
long
as
one
liked
smoking
a
matutinal
cigarette
or
two
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
cup
of
tea
nelly
was
acquiring
the
art
of
the
by
degrees
she
did
not
like
the
taste
at
all
at
first
but
the
wild
and
daring
deviltry
of
the
practice
sustained
her
and
she
persevered
and
while
they
thus
wasted
the
best
hours
of
the
day
ambrose
would
make
to
pass
before
the
bottom
of
the
bed
a
long
procession
of
the
masters
each
uttering
his
characteristic
word
of
horror
and
astonishment
as
he
went
by
each
whirled
away
by
some
invisible
power
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
thus
would
enter
chesson
fully
attired
in
cassock
cap
and
gown
meyrick
it
is
impossible
are
you
not
aware
that
such
conduct
as
this
is
entirely
inconsistent
with
the
tone
of
a
great
public
school
have
the
games
but
he
was
gone
his
legs
were
seen
vanishing
in
a
whirlwind
which
bore
him
up
the
chimney
then
horbury
rose
out
of
the
carpet
plain
living
and
clear
thinking
are
the
notes
of
the
system
a
spartan
discipline
meyrick
do
you
call
this
a
spartan
discipline
smoking
tobacco
and
reposing
with
he
shot
like
an
arrow
after
the
head
we
discourage
luxury
by
every
means
in
our
power
boy
this
is
luxury
boy
boy
you
are
like
the
later
romans
boy
heliogabalus
was
accustomed
the
chimney
consumed
palmer
also
and
he
gave
place
to
another
roughly
speaking
a
boy
should
be
always
either
in
school
or
playing
games
he
should
never
be
suffered
to
be
at
a
loose
end
is
this
your
idea
of
playing
games
i
tell
you
meyrick
the
game
amused
nelly
more
from
its
accompanying
business
and
facial
expression
than
from
any
particular
comprehension
of
the
dialogue
ambrose
saw
that
she
could
not
grasp
all
the
comedy
of
his
situations
so
he
invented
an
idyll
between
the
doctor
and
a
notorious
and
flamboyant
barmaid
at
the
bell
the
fame
of
this
lady
ran
great
but
not
gracious
through
all
lupton
this
proved
a
huge
success
beginning
as
a
mere
episode
it
gathered
to
itself
a
complicated
network
of
incidents
and
adventures
of
wild
attempts
and
strange
escapes
of
stratagems
and
ambushes
of
disguises
and
alarms
indeed
as
ambrose
instructed
nelly
with
great
solemnity
the
tale
at
first
an
idyll
the
simple
pastoral
story
of
the
loves
of
the
shepherd
chesson
and
the
nymph
bella
was
rapidly
becoming
epical
in
its
character
he
talked
of
dividing
it
into
twelve
books
he
enlarged
very
elaborately
the
defeat
of
the
suitors
in
this
the
dear
old
head
disguised
as
a
bookmaker
drugged
the
whisky
of
the
young
bloods
who
were
accustomed
to
throng
about
the
inner
bar
of
the
bell
there
was
quite
a
long
passage
describing
the
compounding
of
the
patent
draught
from
various
herbs
the
enormous
cook
at
the
head
house
enacting
a
kind
of
canidia
part
and
helping
in
the
concoction
of
the
dose
belper
the
doctor
would
observe
this
is
gratifying
i
had
no
idea
that
your
knowledge
of
simples
was
so
extensive
do
i
understand
you
to
affirm
that
those
few
leaves
which
you
hold
in
your
hand
will
produce
marked
symptoms
bless
your
dear
doctor
chesson
and
if
you
forgive
me
for
talking
so
to
such
a
learned
gentleman
and
so
good
i
sure
but
you
find
there
nothing
in
the
world
like
it
often
and
often
have
i
my
pore
old
mother
that
dead
and
gone
these
forty
year
come
candlemas
belper
belper
i
am
surprised
at
you
are
you
not
aware
that
the
judicial
committee
of
the
privy
council
has
pronounced
the
observance
of
the
festival
you
so
lightly
name
to
be
of
a
highly
superstitious
nature
your
deceased
mother
you
were
saying
will
have
entered
into
her
reward
forty
years
ago
on
february
the
second
of
next
year
is
not
this
the
case
these
forty
years
came
febbymas
i
mean
and
a
good
woman
she
was
and
never
have
i
seen
a
larger
wart
on
the
nose
and
her
legs
bad
as
bad
for
years
and
years
these
details
though
no
doubt
of
high
personal
interest
seem
hardly
germane
to
our
present
undertaking
however
belper
proceed
in
your
remarks
and
thank
you
kindly
sir
and
not
forgetting
you
are
a
clergyman
but
there
we
ca
all
of
us
be
everything
and
my
pore
mother
as
i
was
saying
sir
she
said
again
and
again
that
if
she
been
like
some
folks
she
a
made
a
fortune
in
golden
money
from
this
very
yarb
you
sir
dear
me
belper
you
interest
me
deeply
i
have
often
thought
how
wrong
it
is
of
us
to
neglect
as
undoubtedly
we
neglect
the
bounteous
gifts
of
the
kindly
earth
your
lamented
mother
used
this
specific
with
remarkable
success
lord
a
mercy
doctor
elephants
could
a
stood
against
it
nor
yet
whales
being
as
how
it
stronger
than
the
strongest
gunpowder
that
was
ever
brewed
or
blasted
and
miles
better
than
the
nasty
rubbidge
you
get
in
them
doctors
shops
and
a
pretty
penny
they
make
you
pay
for
it
and
no
better
than
calomel
if
you
ask
me
sir
but
be
it
the
strongest
of
the
strong
i
take
my
gospel
oath
it
weak
to
what
my
pore
mother
made
and
that
anybody
in
much
moddle
parish
would
tell
you
for
man
woman
or
child
who
took
one
of
mixtures
and
got
over
it
remember
it
he
would
until
his
dying
day
and
my
pore
old
mother
she
was
that
funny
never
was
a
cheerfuller
woman
i
do
believe
and
when
tom
copus
the
lame
fiddler
he
got
married
pore
mother
though
she
could
hardly
walk
her
legs
was
that
bad
come
she
would
and
if
she
did
slip
a
little
of
the
mixture
into
the
beer
when
everybody
was
looking
another
way
pore
dear
soul
as
she
said
herself
afterwards
becomes
marriage
and
so
to
be
sure
it
does
and
merry
they
all
were
that
day
that
did
touch
the
beer
preferring
spirits
which
pore
mother
could
get
at
being
locked
up
a
nasty
mean
trick
i
call
it
and
always
will
enough
belper
enough
you
have
amply
satisfied
me
as
to
the
potency
of
the
late
marjoram
pharmacopoeia
we
will
if
you
have
no
objection
belper
make
the
mixture
to
use
the
words
of
shakespeare
and
thick
and
bless
your
kind
sir
and
a
good
kind
master
you
always
been
to
me
if
you
got
enough
to
lay
out
all
the
lupton
town
call
me
a
dutchwoman
and
that
i
never
was
nor
pore
belper
neither
certainly
not
belper
the
dutch
belong
to
a
different
branch
of
the
great
teutonic
stock
or
if
identity
had
ever
existed
the
two
races
have
long
been
differentiated
i
think
belper
that
the
most
eminent
physicians
have
recognised
the
beneficial
effects
of
a
gentle
laxative
during
the
treacherous
though
delightful
season
of
spring
law
bless
you
sir
you
right
as
you
always
are
or
why
doctor
as
my
pore
mother
used
to
say
when
she
made
up
the
mixture
out
is
the
right
way
about
and
laugh
she
would
as
she
pounded
the
stuff
up
till
i
really
thought
she
would
busted
and
shaking
like
the
best
blancmanges
all
the
while
belper
you
have
removed
a
weight
from
my
mind
you
think
then
that
i
shall
be
freed
from
all
unfair
competition
while
i
pay
my
addresses
to
my
young
friend
miss
floyer
as
free
you
will
be
doctor
chesson
sir
as
the
little
birds
in
the
air
for
not
one
of
them
young
fellers
will
stand
on
his
feet
for
days
and
groans
and
will
be
the
best
word
that
mortal
man
will
speak
and
bless
you
they
will
with
their
dying
breath
so
sir
you
the
sweet
young
lady
bless
her
dear
all
to
yourself
and
if
twins
do
blame
me
belper
your
construction
if
i
may
say
so
is
somewhat
proleptic
in
its
character
still
i
am
sure
that
your
meaning
is
good
ha
i
hear
the
bell
for
afternoon
school
the
doctor
voice
happened
to
be
shrill
and
piercing
with
something
of
the
tone
of
the
and
while
the
fat
cook
spoke
in
a
suety
husky
contralto
ambrose
reproduced
these
peculiarities
with
the
gift
of
the
born
mimic
adding
appropriate
antic
and
gesture
to
grace
the
show
and
nelly
appreciation
of
its
humours
was
intense
day
by
day
new
incidents
and
scenes
were
added
the
head
in
the
pursuit
of
his
guilty
passion
hid
in
the
of
the
bell
and
rustling
sounds
being
heard
evaded
detection
for
a
while
by
imitating
the
barks
of
a
terrier
in
chase
of
a
rat
nelly
liked
to
hear
the
wuff
wuff
wuff
which
was
introduced
at
this
point
she
liked
also
the
final
catastrophe
when
the
odd
man
of
the
bell
burst
into
the
bar
and
said
dang
my
eyes
if
it
ai
the
doctor
i
seed
his
cap
and
gown
as
he
run
round
and
round
the
coals
on
all
fours
to
which
the
landlady
rejoined
do
tell
your
silly
lies
here
how
he
growl
him
being
a
clergyman
and
all
the
loafers
joined
in
the
chorus
that
right
tom
why
you
talk
such
silly
lies
as
that
him
being
a
clergyman
they
laughed
so
loud
and
so
merrily
over
their
morning
tea
and
these
lunacies
that
the
landlady
doubted
gravely
as
to
their
marriage
lines
she
cared
nothing
they
had
paid
what
she
asked
money
down
in
advance
and
as
she
said
young
gentlemen
have
their
fun
with
the
young
ladies
so
what
the
good
of
talking
breakfast
came
at
length
they
gave
the
landlady
a
warning
bell
some
in
advance
so
the
odd
food
was
at
all
events
not
cold
afterwards
nelly
sallied
off
on
her
shopping
expeditions
which
as
might
have
been
expected
she
enjoyed
hugely
and
ambrose
stayed
alone
with
his
pen
and
ink
and
a
fat
notebook
which
had
captured
his
eye
in
a
stationer
window
under
these
odd
circumstances
then
he
laid
the
foundations
of
his
rare
and
precious
of
which
is
now
termed
by
those
fortunate
enough
to
possess
copies
as
a
unique
and
golden
treatise
though
he
added
a
good
deal
in
later
years
and
remodelled
and
rearranged
freely
there
is
a
certain
charm
of
vigour
and
freshness
about
the
first
sketch
which
is
quite
delightful
in
its
way
take
for
example
the
description
of
the
whole
world
overwhelmed
with
sobriety
a
deadly
absence
of
inebriation
annulling
and
destroying
all
the
works
and
thoughts
of
men
the
country
itself
at
point
to
perish
of
the
want
of
good
liquor
and
good
drinkers
he
shows
how
there
is
grave
cause
to
dread
that
by
reason
of
this
sad
neglect
of
the
dionysiac
mysteries
humanity
is
fast
falling
backward
from
the
great
heights
to
which
it
had
ascended
and
is
in
imminent
danger
of
returning
to
the
dumb
and
blind
and
helpless
condition
of
the
brutes
how
else
he
says
can
one
account
for
the
stricken
state
in
which
all
the
animal
world
grows
and
is
eternally
impotent
to
them
strange
vast
and
enormous
powers
and
faculties
have
been
given
consider
for
example
the
curious
equipments
of
two
odd
extremes
in
this
sphere
the
ant
and
the
elephant
the
ant
if
one
may
say
so
is
very
near
to
us
we
have
our
great
centres
of
industry
our
black
country
and
our
slaves
who
if
not
born
black
become
black
in
our
service
and
the
ants
too
have
their
black
enslaved
races
who
do
their
dirty
work
for
them
and
are
perhaps
congratulated
on
their
privileges
as
sharing
in
the
blessings
of
civilisation
though
this
may
be
a
refinement
the
ant
slaves
i
believe
will
rally
eagerly
to
the
defence
of
the
nest
and
the
eggs
and
they
say
that
the
labouring
classes
are
liberal
to
the
core
nay
we
grow
mushrooms
by
art
and
so
they
in
some
lands
i
think
they
make
enormous
nests
which
are
the
nuisance
and
terror
of
the
country
we
have
manchester
and
lupton
and
leeds
and
many
such
places
one
would
think
them
altogether
civilised
the
elephant
again
has
many
gifts
which
we
lack
note
the
curious
instinct
or
intuition
rather
of
danger
the
elephant
knows
for
example
when
a
bridge
is
unsafe
and
refuses
to
pass
where
a
man
would
go
on
to
destruction
one
might
examine
in
the
same
way
all
the
creatures
and
find
in
them
singular
capacities
yet
they
have
no
art
they
see
but
they
see
not
they
hear
and
they
hear
not
the
odour
in
their
nostrils
has
no
sweetness
at
all
they
have
made
no
report
of
all
the
wonders
that
they
knew
their
houses
are
sometimes
as
ingenious
as
a
chemical
works
but
never
is
there
any
beauty
for
beauty
sake
it
is
clear
that
their
state
is
thus
desolate
because
of
the
heavy
pall
of
sobriety
that
hangs
over
them
all
and
it
scarcely
seems
to
have
occurred
to
our
advocates
that
when
they
urge
on
us
the
example
and
abstinence
of
the
beasts
they
have
advanced
the
deadliest
of
all
arguments
against
their
nostrum
the
laughing
jackass
is
a
teetotaller
doubtless
but
no
sane
man
should
desire
to
be
a
laughing
jackass
but
the
history
of
the
men
who
have
attained
who
have
done
the
glorious
things
of
the
earth
and
have
become
for
ever
exalted
is
the
history
of
the
men
who
have
quested
the
cup
dionysius
said
the
greeks
the
world
and
the
bacchic
mystery
was
naturally
the
heart
and
core
of
greek
civilisation
note
the
similitudes
of
vine
and
vineyard
in
old
testament
note
the
quest
of
the
san
graal
note
rabelais
and
dive
place
yourself
in
imagination
in
a
gothic
cathedral
of
the
thirteenth
century
and
assist
at
high
mass
then
go
to
the
nearest
little
bethel
and
look
and
listen
consider
the
difference
in
the
two
buildings
in
those
who
worship
in
one
and
listen
and
criticise
in
the
other
you
have
the
difference
between
the
inebriated
and
the
sober
displayed
in
their
works
as
little
bethel
is
to
tintern
so
is
sobriety
to
inebriation
modern
civilisation
has
advanced
in
many
ways
yes
bethel
has
a
stucco
front
this
material
was
quite
unknown
to
the
builders
of
tintern
abbey
advanced
what
is
advancement
freedom
from
excesses
from
extravagances
from
wild
enthusiasms
small
protestant
tradesmen
are
free
from
all
these
things
certainly
but
is
the
joy
of
adulteration
to
be
the
last
goal
the
final
initiation
of
the
race
of
men
to
sand
the
sugar
the
flagons
of
the
song
of
songs
did
not
contain
but
the
worst
of
it
is
we
shall
not
merely
descend
to
the
beasts
we
shall
fall
very
far
below
the
beasts
a
black
fellow
is
good
and
a
white
fellow
is
good
but
the
white
fellow
who
fantee
does
not
become
a
negro
he
becomes
something
infinitely
worse
a
horrible
mass
of
the
most
putrid
corruption
if
we
can
clear
our
minds
of
the
horrible
cant
of
our
if
we
can
look
at
a
modern
centre
with
eyes
purged
of
illusions
we
shall
have
some
notion
of
the
awful
horror
to
which
we
are
descending
in
our
effort
to
become
as
the
ants
and
bees
creatures
who
know
nothing
of
calix
inebrians
i
doubt
if
we
can
really
make
this
effort
blacks
stinks
desolations
poisons
hell
nightmare
generally
have
i
suspect
worked
themselves
into
the
very
form
and
mould
of
our
thoughts
we
are
sober
and
perhaps
the
tavern
door
is
shut
for
ever
against
us
now
and
then
perhaps
at
rarer
and
still
rarer
intervals
a
few
of
us
will
hear
very
faintly
the
far
echoes
of
the
holy
madness
within
the
closed
door
when
up
the
thyrse
is
raised
and
when
the
sound
of
sacred
orgies
flies
around
which
is
the
epulantium
in
√¶terno
but
this
we
shall
not
be
able
to
discern
very
likely
we
shall
take
the
noise
of
this
high
choir
for
the
horrid
mirth
of
hell
how
strange
it
is
that
those
who
are
pledged
officially
and
ceremonially
as
it
were
to
a
rite
of
initiation
which
figures
certainly
a
feast
should
in
all
their
thoughts
and
words
and
actions
be
continually
blaspheming
and
denying
all
the
uses
and
ends
of
feastings
and
festivals
this
is
not
the
refusal
of
the
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
perfectly
the
most
beautiful
and
desirable
it
is
the
renouncing
of
species
and
genus
the
pronouncing
of
good
to
be
evil
the
universal
being
denied
the
particular
is
degraded
and
defiled
what
is
called
drink
curse
is
the
natural
and
inevitable
result
and
sequence
of
the
reformation
if
the
clear
wells
and
fountains
of
the
magic
wood
are
buried
out
of
sight
then
men
who
must
have
drink
will
betake
them
to
the
slime
ponds
and
poison
pools
in
the
graal
books
there
is
a
curse
an
evil
enchantment
on
the
land
of
logres
because
the
mystery
of
the
holy
vessel
is
disregarded
the
knight
sees
the
dripping
spear
and
the
shining
cup
pass
before
him
and
says
no
word
he
asks
no
question
as
to
the
end
and
meaning
of
this
ceremony
so
the
land
is
blasted
and
barren
and
songless
and
those
who
dwell
in
it
are
in
misery
every
day
of
our
lives
we
see
the
graal
carried
before
us
in
a
wonderful
order
and
every
day
we
leave
the
question
unasked
the
mystery
despised
and
neglected
yet
if
we
could
ask
that
question
bowing
down
before
these
heavenly
and
glorious
splendours
and
hallows
then
every
man
should
have
the
meat
and
drink
that
his
soul
desired
the
hall
would
be
filled
with
odours
of
paradise
with
the
light
of
immortality
in
the
books
the
graal
was
at
last
taken
away
because
of
unworthiness
so
it
will
be
i
suppose
even
now
the
adventure
is
a
desperate
one
few
there
be
that
find
it
ventilation
and
sanitation
are
well
enough
in
their
way
but
it
would
not
be
very
satisfactory
to
pass
the
day
in
a
ventilated
and
sanitated
hell
with
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
if
one
is
perishing
of
hunger
and
thirst
sanitation
seems
unimportant
enough
how
wonderful
how
glorious
it
would
be
if
the
kingdom
of
the
great
drinkers
could
be
restored
if
we
could
only
sweep
away
all
the
might
of
the
sober
ones
the
factory
builders
the
poison
makers
the
politicians
the
manufacturers
of
bad
books
and
bad
pictures
together
with
little
bethel
and
the
morality
of
mildmay
the
curate
a
series
of
negative
propositions
then
imagine
the
great
light
of
the
great
inebriation
shining
on
every
face
and
not
any
work
of
man
hands
from
a
cathedral
to
a
penknife
without
the
mark
of
the
tavern
upon
it
all
the
world
a
great
festival
every
well
a
fountain
of
strong
drink
every
river
running
with
the
new
wine
the
sangraal
brought
back
from
sarras
restored
to
the
awful
shrine
of
the
oracle
of
the
once
more
freely
given
the
ruined
vineyard
flourishing
once
more
girt
about
by
shining
everlasting
walls
then
we
should
hear
the
old
songs
again
and
they
would
dance
the
old
dances
the
happy
ransomed
people
commensals
and
compotators
of
the
everlasting
tavern
the
whole
treatise
of
which
this
extract
is
a
fragment
in
a
rudimentary
and
imperfect
stage
is
of
course
an
impassioned
appeal
for
the
restoration
of
the
quickening
exuberant
imagination
not
merely
in
art
but
in
all
the
inmost
places
of
life
there
is
more
than
this
too
here
and
there
one
can
hear
as
it
were
the
whisper
and
the
hint
of
deeper
mysteries
visions
of
a
great
experiment
and
a
great
achievement
to
which
some
men
may
be
called
in
his
own
words
within
the
tavern
there
is
an
inner
tavern
but
the
door
of
it
is
visible
to
few
indeed
in
ambrose
mind
in
the
after
years
the
stout
notebook
was
dear
perhaps
as
a
substitute
for
that
aroma
of
the
past
in
a
phial
which
he
has
declared
so
desirable
an
invention
it
stood
not
so
much
for
what
was
written
in
it
as
for
the
place
and
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
written
it
recalled
little
russell
row
and
nelly
and
the
evenings
at
the
ch√¢teau
de
chinon
where
night
by
night
they
served
still
stranger
more
delicious
meats
and
the
red
wine
revealed
more
clearly
its
high
celestial
origin
one
evening
was
diversified
by
an
odd
encounter
a
man
sitting
at
an
adjoining
table
was
evidently
in
want
of
matches
and
ambrose
handed
his
box
with
the
sympathetic
smile
which
one
smoker
gives
to
another
in
such
cases
the
man
he
had
a
black
moustache
and
a
small
pointed
beard
thanked
him
in
fluent
english
with
a
french
accent
and
they
began
to
talk
of
casual
things
veering
by
degrees
in
the
direction
of
the
arts
the
frenchman
smiled
at
enthusiasm
what
a
life
you
have
before
you
he
said
do
you
know
that
the
populace
always
hates
the
artist
and
kills
him
if
it
can
you
are
an
artist
and
mystic
too
what
a
fate
yes
but
it
is
that
applause
that
that
comes
after
the
artist
is
dead
he
went
on
replying
to
some
objection
of
ambrose
it
is
that
which
is
the
worst
cruelty
of
all
it
is
fine
for
burns
is
it
not
that
his
stupid
compatriots
have
not
ceased
to
utter
follies
about
him
for
the
last
eighty
years
scotchmen
but
they
should
be
ashamed
to
speak
his
name
and
keats
and
how
many
others
in
my
country
and
in
yours
and
in
all
countries
the
imbeciles
are
not
content
to
calumniate
to
persecute
to
make
wretched
the
artist
in
his
lifetime
they
follow
him
with
their
praise
to
the
grave
the
grave
that
they
have
digged
praise
of
the
populace
praise
of
a
race
of
pigs
for
you
see
while
they
are
insulting
the
dead
with
their
compliments
they
are
at
the
same
time
insulting
the
living
with
their
abuse
he
dropped
into
silence
from
his
expression
he
seemed
to
be
cursing
the
populace
with
oaths
too
frightful
to
be
uttered
he
rose
suddenly
and
turned
to
ambrose
artist
and
mystic
yes
you
will
probably
be
crucified
good
evening
and
a
fine
martyrdom
to
you
he
was
gone
with
a
charming
smile
and
a
delightful
bow
to
madame
ambrose
looked
after
him
with
a
puzzled
face
his
last
words
had
called
up
some
memory
that
he
could
not
capture
and
then
suddenly
he
recollected
the
old
ragged
irish
fiddler
the
player
of
strange
fantasies
under
the
tree
in
the
outskirts
of
lupton
he
thought
of
his
phrase
about
red
martyrdom
it
was
an
odd
coincidence
iv
the
phrases
kept
recurring
to
his
mind
after
they
had
gone
out
and
as
they
wandered
through
the
lighted
streets
with
all
their
strange
and
variegated
show
with
glittering
windows
and
glittering
lamps
with
the
ebb
and
flow
of
faces
the
voices
and
the
laughter
the
surging
crowds
about
the
theatre
doors
the
flashing
hansoms
and
the
omnibuses
lumbering
heavily
along
to
strange
regions
such
as
turnham
green
and
castlenau
cricklewood
and
stoke
newington
why
they
were
as
unknown
as
cities
in
cathay
it
was
a
dim
hot
night
all
the
great
city
smoked
as
with
a
mist
and
a
tawny
moon
rose
through
films
of
cloud
far
in
the
vista
of
the
east
ambrose
thought
with
a
sudden
recollection
that
the
moon
that
world
of
splendour
was
shining
in
a
farther
land
on
the
coast
of
the
wild
rocks
on
the
heaving
sea
on
the
faery
in
avalon
where
though
the
apples
are
always
golden
yet
the
blossoms
of
enchantment
never
fade
but
hang
for
ever
against
the
sky
they
were
passing
a
street
and
these
dreams
were
broken
by
the
sudden
clanging
rattling
music
of
a
for
a
moment
they
saw
the
shadowy
figures
of
the
children
as
they
flitted
to
and
fro
dancing
odd
measures
in
the
rhythm
of
the
tune
then
they
came
into
a
long
narrow
way
with
a
church
spire
in
the
distance
and
near
the
church
they
passed
the
roman
evidently
from
the
subjects
and
the
treatment
of
the
works
of
art
on
view
but
it
was
strange
in
the
middle
of
the
window
was
a
crude
glaring
statue
of
some
saint
he
was
in
bright
red
robes
sprinkled
with
golden
stars
the
blood
rained
down
from
a
wound
in
his
forehead
and
with
one
hand
he
drew
the
scarlet
vestment
aside
and
pointed
to
the
dreadful
gash
above
his
heart
and
from
this
again
the
bloody
drops
fell
thick
the
colours
stared
and
shrieked
and
yet
through
the
bad
cheap
art
there
seemed
to
shine
a
rapture
that
was
very
near
to
beauty
the
thing
expressed
was
so
great
that
it
had
to
a
certain
extent
overcome
the
villainy
of
the
expression
they
wandered
vaguely
after
their
custom
ambrose
was
silent
he
was
thinking
of
avalon
and
red
martyrdom
and
the
frenchman
parting
salutation
of
the
vision
in
one
of
the
old
books
the
man
clothed
in
a
robe
redder
and
more
shining
than
burning
fire
and
his
feet
and
his
hands
and
his
face
were
of
a
like
flame
and
five
angels
in
fiery
vesture
stood
about
him
and
at
the
feet
of
the
man
the
ground
was
covered
with
a
ruddy
dew
they
passed
under
an
old
church
tower
that
rose
white
in
the
moonlight
above
them
the
air
had
cleared
the
mist
had
floated
away
and
now
the
sky
glowed
violet
and
the
white
stones
of
the
classic
spirit
shone
on
high
from
it
there
came
suddenly
a
tumult
of
glad
sound
exultant
bells
in
order
pealing
out
as
if
to
honour
some
great
victory
so
that
the
mirth
of
the
street
below
became
but
a
trivial
restless
noise
he
thought
of
some
passage
that
he
had
read
but
could
not
distinctly
remember
a
ship
was
coming
back
to
its
haven
after
a
weary
and
tempestuous
voyage
over
many
dreadful
seas
and
those
on
board
saw
the
tumult
in
the
city
as
their
sails
were
sighted
heard
afar
the
shouts
of
gladness
from
the
rejoicing
people
heard
the
bells
from
all
the
spires
and
towers
break
suddenly
into
triumphant
chorus
sounding
high
above
the
washing
of
the
waves
ambrose
roused
himself
from
his
dreams
they
had
been
walking
in
a
circle
and
had
returned
almost
to
the
street
of
the
ch√¢teau
though
their
knowledge
of
the
district
being
of
an
unscientific
character
they
were
under
the
impression
that
they
were
a
mile
or
so
away
from
that
particular
point
as
it
happened
they
had
not
entered
this
street
before
and
they
were
charmed
at
the
sudden
appearance
of
stained
glass
lighted
up
from
within
the
colour
was
rich
and
good
there
were
flourished
scrolls
and
grotesques
in
the
renaissance
manner
many
emblazoned
shields
in
ruby
and
gold
and
azure
and
the
showed
the
court
of
the
beer
king
a
jovial
and
venerable
figure
attended
by
a
host
of
dwarfs
and
kobolds
all
holding
on
high
enormous
mugs
of
beer
they
went
in
boldly
and
were
glad
it
was
the
famous
three
kings
in
its
golden
and
unreformed
days
but
this
they
knew
not
the
room
was
of
moderate
size
very
low
with
great
dark
beams
in
the
white
ceiling
white
were
the
walls
on
the
plaster
texts
with
vermilion
initials
praised
the
drinker
art
and
more
kobolds
in
black
and
red
loomed
oddly
in
unsuspected
corners
the
lighting
presumably
was
gas
but
all
that
was
visible
were
great
antique
lanterns
depending
from
iron
hooks
and
through
their
dull
green
glass
only
a
dim
radiance
fell
upon
the
heavy
oak
tables
and
the
drinkers
from
the
middle
beam
an
enormous
bouquet
of
fresh
hops
hung
on
high
there
was
a
subdued
murmur
of
talk
and
now
and
then
the
clatter
of
the
lid
of
a
mug
as
fresh
beer
was
ordered
in
one
corner
there
was
a
kind
of
bar
behind
it
a
couple
of
grim
women
the
kobolds
apparently
performed
their
office
and
above
on
a
sort
of
rack
hung
mugs
and
tankards
of
all
sizes
and
of
all
fantasies
there
were
plain
mugs
of
creamy
earthenware
mugs
gaudily
and
oddly
painted
with
garlanded
goats
with
hunting
scenes
with
towering
castles
with
flaming
posies
of
flowers
then
some
friend
of
the
drunken
some
sage
who
had
pried
curiously
into
the
secrets
of
thirst
had
made
a
series
of
wonders
in
glass
so
shining
and
crystalline
that
to
behold
them
was
as
if
one
looked
into
a
well
for
every
glitter
of
the
facets
gave
promise
of
satisfaction
there
were
the
mugs
capacious
and
very
deep
crowned
for
the
most
part
not
with
mere
plain
lids
of
common
use
and
make
but
with
tall
spires
in
pewter
richly
ornamented
evident
survivals
from
the
middle
ages
ambrose
eyes
glistened
the
place
was
altogether
as
he
would
have
designed
it
nelly
too
was
glad
to
sit
down
for
they
had
walked
longer
than
usual
she
was
refreshed
by
a
glass
of
some
cool
drink
with
a
borage
flower
and
a
cherry
floating
in
it
and
ambrose
ordered
a
mug
of
beer
it
is
not
known
how
many
of
these
he
emptied
it
was
as
has
been
noted
a
sultry
night
and
the
streets
were
dusty
and
that
glass
of
benedictine
after
dinner
rather
evokes
than
dismisses
the
demon
of
thirst
still
munich
beer
is
no
hot
and
rebellious
drink
so
the
causes
of
what
followed
must
probably
be
sought
for
in
other
springs
ambrose
took
a
deep
draught
gazed
upward
to
the
ceiling
and
ordered
another
mug
of
beer
for
himself
and
some
more
of
the
cool
and
delicate
and
flowery
beverage
for
nelly
when
the
drink
was
set
upon
the
board
he
thus
began
without
title
or
preface
you
must
know
nelly
dear
he
said
that
the
marriage
of
panurge
which
fell
out
in
due
time
according
to
the
oracle
and
advice
of
the
holy
bottle
was
by
no
means
a
fortunate
one
for
against
all
the
counsel
of
pantagruel
and
of
friar
john
and
indeed
of
all
his
friends
panurge
married
in
a
fit
of
spleen
and
obstinacy
the
crooked
and
squinting
daughter
of
the
little
old
man
who
sold
green
sauce
in
the
rue
quincangrogne
at
tours
you
will
see
the
very
place
in
a
few
days
and
then
you
will
understand
everything
you
do
not
understand
that
my
child
that
is
impiety
since
it
accuses
the
zeitgest
who
is
certainly
the
only
god
that
ever
existed
as
you
will
see
more
fully
demonstrated
in
huxley
and
spencer
and
all
the
leading
articles
in
all
the
leading
newspapers
erat
to
be
still
more
precise
you
must
know
that
when
i
am
dead
and
a
very
great
man
indeed
many
thousands
of
people
will
come
from
all
the
quarters
of
the
globe
not
forgetting
the
united
states
to
lupton
they
will
come
and
stare
very
hard
at
the
old
grange
which
will
have
an
inscription
about
me
on
the
wall
they
will
spend
hours
in
high
school
they
will
walk
all
round
playing
fields
they
will
cut
little
bits
off
and
then
they
will
view
the
sulphuric
acid
works
the
chemical
manure
factory
and
the
free
library
and
whatever
other
and
cesspools
lupton
town
may
contain
they
will
finally
enjoy
the
view
of
the
midland
railway
goods
station
then
they
will
say
we
understand
him
one
sees
how
he
got
all
his
inspiration
in
that
lovely
old
school
and
the
wonderful
english
so
you
see
that
when
i
show
you
the
rue
quincangrogne
you
will
perfectly
understand
this
history
let
us
drink
the
world
shall
never
be
drowned
again
so
have
no
fear
well
the
fact
remains
that
panurge
having
married
this
hideous
wench
aforesaid
was
excessively
unhappy
it
was
in
vain
that
he
argued
with
his
wife
in
all
known
languages
and
in
some
that
are
unknown
for
as
she
said
she
only
knew
two
languages
the
one
of
touraine
and
the
other
of
the
stick
and
this
second
she
taught
panurge
modum
that
is
by
beating
him
and
this
so
thoroughly
that
poor
pilgarlic
was
sore
from
head
to
foot
he
was
a
worthy
little
fellow
but
the
greatest
coward
that
ever
breathed
believe
me
illustrious
drinkers
and
most
precious
nelly
never
was
man
so
wretched
as
this
panurge
since
paradise
fell
from
adam
this
is
the
true
doctrine
i
heard
it
when
i
was
at
eleusis
you
enquire
what
was
the
matter
why
in
the
first
place
this
vile
wretch
whom
they
all
called
so
much
did
they
hate
her
la
vie
mortale
or
deadly
life
this
vile
wretch
i
say
what
do
you
think
that
she
did
when
the
last
note
of
the
fiddles
had
sounded
and
the
wedding
guests
had
gone
off
to
the
lampreys
to
kill
a
certain
worm
the
which
worm
is
most
certainly
immortal
since
it
is
not
dead
yet
well
then
what
did
madame
panurge
nothing
but
this
she
robbed
her
excellent
and
devoted
husband
of
all
that
he
had
doubtless
you
remember
how
in
the
old
days
panurge
had
played
ducks
and
drakes
with
the
money
that
pantagruel
had
given
him
so
that
he
borrowed
on
his
corn
while
it
was
still
in
the
ear
and
before
it
was
sown
if
we
enquire
a
little
more
closely
in
truth
the
good
little
man
never
had
a
penny
to
bless
himself
withal
for
the
which
cause
pantagruel
loved
him
all
the
more
dearly
so
that
when
the
dive
bouteille
gave
its
oracle
and
panurge
chose
his
spouse
pantagruel
showed
how
preciously
he
esteemed
a
hearty
spender
by
giving
him
such
a
treasure
that
the
goldsmiths
who
live
under
the
bell
of
gatien
still
talk
of
it
before
they
dine
because
by
doing
so
their
mouths
water
and
these
salivary
secretions
are
of
high
benefit
to
the
digestion
read
on
this
galen
if
you
would
know
how
great
and
glorious
this
treasure
was
you
must
go
to
the
library
of
the
archev√™ch√©
at
tours
where
they
will
show
you
a
vast
volume
bound
in
pigskin
the
name
of
which
i
have
forgotten
but
this
book
is
nothing
else
than
the
list
of
all
the
wonders
and
glories
of
pantagruel
wedding
present
to
panurge
it
contains
surprising
things
i
can
tell
you
for
in
good
coin
of
the
realm
alone
never
was
gift
that
might
compare
with
it
and
besides
the
common
money
there
were
ancient
pieces
the
very
names
of
which
are
now
incomprehensible
and
incomprehensible
they
will
remain
till
the
coming
of
the
coqcigrues
there
was
for
instance
a
great
gold
sol
a
world
in
itself
as
some
said
truly
and
i
know
not
how
many
myriad
myriad
of
√©toiles
all
of
the
finest
silver
that
was
ever
minted
and
which
the
learned
think
must
have
been
first
coined
at
angers
though
others
will
have
it
that
they
were
the
same
as
our
angels
and
as
for
roses
de
paradis
and
couronnes
immortelles
i
believe
he
had
as
many
of
them
as
ever
he
would
beauties
and
joys
he
was
to
keep
for
small
change
is
sometimes
great
gain
and
as
i
say
no
sooner
had
panurge
married
that
accursed
daughter
of
the
rue
quincangrogne
than
she
robbed
him
of
everything
down
to
the
last
brass
farthing
the
fact
is
that
the
woman
was
a
witch
she
was
also
something
else
which
i
leave
out
for
the
present
but
if
you
will
believe
me
she
cast
such
a
spell
upon
panurge
that
he
thought
himself
an
absolute
beggar
thus
he
would
look
at
his
sol
and
say
is
the
use
of
that
it
is
only
a
great
bright
lump
i
can
see
it
every
day
then
when
they
said
how
about
those
he
would
reply
are
they
have
you
seen
them
never
see
them
show
them
to
me
and
so
with
all
else
and
all
the
while
that
villain
of
a
woman
beat
thumped
and
belaboured
him
so
that
the
tears
were
always
in
his
eyes
and
they
say
you
could
hear
him
howling
all
over
the
world
everybody
said
that
he
had
made
a
pretty
mess
of
it
and
would
come
to
a
bad
end
luckily
for
him
this
witch
of
a
wife
of
his
would
sometimes
doze
off
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
he
had
a
little
peace
and
he
would
wonder
what
had
become
of
all
the
gay
girls
and
gracious
ladies
that
he
had
known
in
old
times
for
he
had
played
the
devil
with
the
women
in
his
day
and
could
have
taught
ovid
lessons
in
now
of
course
it
was
as
much
as
his
life
was
worth
to
mention
the
very
name
of
one
of
these
ladies
and
as
for
any
little
sly
visits
stolen
endearments
hidden
embraces
or
any
small
matters
of
that
kind
it
was
i
shall
see
you
next
nor
was
this
all
but
worse
remains
behind
and
it
is
my
belief
that
it
is
the
thought
of
what
i
am
going
to
tell
you
that
makes
the
wind
wail
and
cry
of
winter
nights
and
the
clouds
weep
and
the
sky
look
black
for
in
truth
it
is
the
greatest
sorrow
that
ever
was
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
i
must
out
with
it
quick
or
i
shall
never
have
done
in
plain
english
and
as
true
as
i
sit
here
drinking
good
ale
not
one
drop
or
minim
or
drachm
or
pennyweight
of
drink
had
panurge
tasted
since
the
day
of
his
wedding
he
had
implored
mercy
he
had
told
her
how
he
had
served
gargantua
and
pantagruel
and
had
got
into
the
habit
of
drinking
in
his
sleep
and
his
wife
had
merely
advised
him
to
go
to
the
devil
she
was
not
going
to
let
him
so
much
as
look
at
the
nasty
stuff
touch
not
taste
not
smell
not
is
my
motto
said
she
she
gave
him
a
blue
ribbon
which
she
said
would
make
up
for
it
do
you
want
with
drink
said
she
and
do
business
instead
it
much
better
for
you
sad
then
and
sorry
enough
was
the
estate
of
poor
panurge
at
last
so
wretched
did
he
become
that
he
took
advantage
of
one
of
his
dozes
and
stole
away
to
the
good
pantagruel
and
told
him
the
whole
story
and
a
very
bad
one
it
was
so
that
the
tears
rolled
down
pantagruel
cheeks
from
sheer
grief
and
each
teardrop
contained
exactly
one
hundred
and
eighteen
gallons
of
aqueous
fluid
according
to
the
calculations
of
the
best
geometers
the
great
man
saw
that
the
case
was
a
desperate
one
and
heaven
knew
he
said
whether
it
could
be
mended
or
not
but
certain
it
was
that
a
business
such
as
this
could
not
be
settled
in
a
hurry
since
it
was
not
like
a
game
at
to
be
got
over
between
two
gallons
of
wine
he
therefore
counselled
panurge
to
have
patience
and
bear
with
his
wife
for
a
few
thousand
years
and
in
the
meantime
they
would
see
what
could
be
done
but
lest
his
patience
should
wear
out
he
gave
him
an
odd
drug
or
medicine
prepared
by
the
great
artist
of
the
mountains
of
cathay
and
this
he
was
to
drop
into
his
wife
glass
for
though
he
might
have
no
drink
she
was
drunk
three
times
a
day
and
she
would
sleep
all
the
longer
and
leave
him
awhile
in
peace
this
panurge
very
faithfully
performed
and
got
a
little
rest
now
and
again
and
they
say
that
while
that
devil
of
a
woman
snored
and
snorted
he
was
able
by
odd
chances
once
or
twice
to
get
hold
of
a
drop
of
the
right
stuff
good
old
stingo
from
the
big
barrel
which
he
lapped
up
as
eagerly
as
a
kitten
laps
cream
others
there
be
who
declare
that
once
or
twice
he
got
about
his
sad
old
tricks
while
his
ugly
wife
was
sleeping
in
the
sun
the
women
on
the
maille
make
no
secret
of
their
opinion
that
his
old
mistress
madame
sophia
was
seen
stealing
in
and
out
of
the
house
as
slyly
as
you
please
and
god
knows
what
goes
on
when
the
door
is
shut
but
the
tourainians
were
always
sad
gossips
and
one
must
not
believe
all
that
one
hears
i
leave
out
the
flat
who
are
bold
enough
to
declare
that
he
kept
one
mistress
at
jerusalem
another
at
eleusis
another
in
egypt
and
about
as
many
as
are
contained
in
the
seraglio
of
the
grand
turk
scattered
up
and
down
in
the
towns
and
villages
of
asia
but
i
do
believe
there
was
some
kissing
in
dark
corners
and
a
curtain
hung
across
one
room
in
the
house
could
tell
odd
tales
nevertheless
la
vie
mortale
a
pest
on
her
was
more
often
awake
than
asleep
and
when
she
was
awake
panurge
case
was
worse
than
ever
for
you
see
the
woman
was
no
piece
of
a
fool
and
she
saw
sure
enough
that
something
was
going
on
the
stingo
in
the
barrel
was
lower
than
of
rights
and
more
than
once
she
had
caught
her
husband
looking
almost
happy
at
which
she
beat
the
house
about
his
ears
then
another
time
madame
sophia
dropped
her
ring
and
again
this
sweet
lady
came
one
morning
so
strongly
perfumed
that
she
scented
the
whole
place
and
when
la
vie
woke
up
it
smelt
like
a
church
there
was
fine
work
then
i
promise
you
the
people
heard
the
bangs
and
curses
and
shrieks
and
groans
as
far
as
amboise
on
the
one
side
and
luynes
on
the
other
and
that
year
the
loire
rose
ten
feet
higher
than
the
banks
on
account
of
panurge
tears
as
a
punishment
she
made
him
go
and
be
industrial
and
he
built
ten
thousand
factories
with
twenty
thousand
chimneys
and
all
the
leaves
and
trees
and
green
grass
and
flowers
in
the
world
were
blackened
and
died
and
all
the
waters
were
poisoned
so
that
there
were
no
perch
in
the
loire
and
salmon
fetched
forty
sols
the
pound
at
chinon
market
as
for
the
men
and
women
they
became
yellow
apes
and
listened
to
a
codger
named
calvin
who
told
them
they
would
all
be
damned
eternally
except
himself
and
his
friends
and
they
found
his
doctrine
very
comforting
and
probable
too
since
they
had
the
sense
to
know
that
they
were
more
than
half
damned
already
i
do
know
whether
panurge
fate
was
worse
on
this
occasion
or
on
another
when
his
wife
found
a
book
in
his
writing
full
from
end
to
end
of
poetry
some
of
it
about
the
wonderful
treasure
that
pantagruel
had
given
him
which
he
was
supposed
to
have
forgotten
some
of
it
verses
to
those
old
of
his
with
a
whole
epic
in
praise
of
his
sophia
then
indeed
there
was
the
very
deuce
to
pay
it
was
bread
and
water
stripes
and
torment
all
day
long
and
la
vie
swore
a
great
oath
that
if
he
ever
did
it
again
he
should
be
sent
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
manchester
whereupon
he
fell
into
a
swoon
from
horrid
fright
and
lay
like
a
log
so
that
everybody
thought
he
was
dead
all
this
while
the
great
pantagruel
was
not
idle
perceiving
how
desperate
the
matter
was
he
summoned
the
thousand
and
first
great
oecumenical
council
of
all
the
sages
of
the
wide
world
and
when
the
fathers
had
come
and
had
heard
high
mass
at
gatien
the
session
was
opened
in
a
pavilion
in
the
meadows
by
the
loire
just
under
the
lanterne
of
roche
corbon
whence
this
council
is
always
styled
the
great
and
holy
council
of
the
lantern
if
you
want
to
know
where
the
place
is
you
can
do
so
very
easily
for
there
is
a
choice
tavern
on
the
spot
where
the
pavilion
stood
and
there
you
may
have
and
and
amber
wine
of
vouvray
better
than
in
any
tavern
in
touraine
as
for
the
history
of
the
acts
of
this
great
council
it
is
still
and
so
far
only
two
thousand
volumes
in
elephant
folio
have
been
printed
signo
lucern√¶
cum
permissu
however
as
it
is
necessary
to
be
brief
it
may
be
said
that
the
holy
fathers
of
the
lantern
after
having
heard
the
whole
case
as
it
was
exposed
to
them
by
the
great
clerks
of
pantagruel
having
digested
all
the
arguments
looked
into
the
precedents
applied
themselves
to
the
doctrine
explored
the
hidden
wisdom
consulted
the
canons
searched
the
scriptures
divided
the
dogma
distinguished
the
distinctions
and
answered
the
questions
resolved
with
one
voice
that
there
was
no
help
in
the
world
for
panurge
save
only
this
he
must
forthwith
achieve
the
most
high
noble
and
glorious
quest
of
the
sangraal
for
no
other
way
was
there
under
heaven
by
which
he
might
rid
himself
of
that
pestilent
wife
of
his
la
vie
mortale
and
on
some
other
occasion
said
ambrose
you
may
hear
of
the
last
voyage
of
panurge
to
the
glassy
isle
of
the
holy
graal
of
the
incredible
adventures
that
he
achieved
of
the
dread
perils
through
which
he
passed
of
the
great
wonders
and
marvels
and
compassions
of
the
way
of
the
manner
in
which
he
received
the
title
plentyn
y
tonau
which
signifies
of
the
waterfloods
and
how
at
last
he
gloriously
attained
the
vision
of
the
sangraal
and
was
most
happily
translated
out
of
the
power
of
la
vie
mortale
and
where
is
he
now
said
nelly
who
had
found
the
tale
interesting
but
obscure
it
is
not
precisely
known
opinions
vary
but
there
are
two
odd
things
one
is
that
he
is
exactly
like
that
man
in
the
red
dress
whose
statue
we
saw
in
the
shop
window
and
the
other
is
that
from
that
day
to
this
he
has
never
been
sober
for
a
single
minute
meus
inebrians
quam
pr√¶clarus
est
v
ambrose
took
a
great
draught
from
the
mug
and
emptied
it
and
forthwith
rapped
the
lid
for
a
fresh
supply
nelly
was
somewhat
nervous
she
was
afraid
he
might
begin
to
sing
for
there
were
extravagances
in
the
history
of
panurge
which
seemed
to
her
to
be
of
alcoholic
source
however
he
did
not
sing
he
lapsed
into
silence
gazing
at
the
dark
beams
the
hanging
hops
the
bright
array
of
the
tankards
and
the
groups
of
drinkers
dotted
about
the
room
at
a
neighbouring
table
two
germans
were
making
a
hearty
meal
chumping
the
meat
and
smacking
their
lips
in
a
kind
of
heavy
ecstasy
he
had
but
little
german
but
he
caught
scraps
of
the
conversation
one
man
said
heavenly
swine
cutlets
and
the
other
answered
glorious
eating
nelly
said
ambrose
i
have
a
great
inspiration
she
trembled
visibly
yes
i
have
talked
so
much
that
i
am
hungry
we
will
have
some
supper
they
looked
over
the
list
of
strange
eatables
and
with
the
help
decided
on
leberwurst
and
as
light
and
harmless
with
this
they
ate
crescent
loaves
sprinkled
with
caraway
seeds
there
was
more
munich
and
more
flowery
drink
with
black
coffee
a
and
a
maraschino
to
end
all
for
nelly
the
kobolds
began
to
perform
a
grotesque
and
mystic
dance
in
the
shadows
the
glass
tankards
on
the
rack
glittered
strangely
the
white
walls
with
the
red
and
black
texts
retreated
into
vast
distances
and
the
bouquet
of
hops
seemed
suspended
from
a
remote
star
as
for
ambrose
he
was
certainly
not
according
to
the
baron
definition
he
was
hardly
but
he
was
sensible
let
us
say
of
a
certain
quickening
of
the
fancy
of
a
more
vivid
and
poignant
enjoyment
of
the
whole
situation
of
the
unutterable
gaiety
of
this
mad
escape
from
the
conventions
of
lupton
it
was
a
thursday
night
said
ambrose
in
the
after
years
and
we
were
thinking
of
starting
for
touraine
either
the
next
morning
or
on
saturday
at
latest
it
will
always
be
bright
in
my
mind
that
picture
the
low
room
with
the
oak
beams
the
glittering
tankards
the
hops
hanging
from
the
ceiling
and
nelly
sitting
before
me
sipping
the
scented
drink
from
a
green
glass
it
was
the
last
night
of
gaiety
and
even
then
gaiety
was
mixed
with
odd
patterns
the
frenchman
talk
about
martyrdom
and
the
statue
of
the
saint
pointing
to
the
marks
of
his
passion
standing
in
that
dyed
vesture
with
his
rapt
exultant
face
and
then
the
song
of
final
triumph
and
deliverance
that
rang
out
on
the
chiming
bells
from
the
white
spire
i
think
the
contrast
of
this
solemn
undertone
made
my
heart
all
the
lighter
i
was
in
that
odd
state
in
which
one
delights
to
know
that
one
is
not
being
understood
so
i
told
poor
nelly
story
of
panurge
marriage
to
la
vie
mortale
i
am
sure
she
thought
i
was
drunk
we
went
home
in
a
hansom
and
agreed
that
we
would
have
just
one
cigarette
and
then
go
to
bed
it
was
settled
that
we
would
catch
the
night
boat
to
dieppe
on
the
next
day
and
we
both
laughed
with
joy
at
the
thought
of
the
adventure
and
then
i
do
know
how
it
was
nelly
began
to
tell
me
all
about
herself
she
had
never
said
a
word
before
i
had
never
asked
her
i
never
ask
anybody
about
their
past
lives
what
does
it
matter
you
know
a
certain
class
of
plot
novelists
are
rather
fond
of
using
it
in
which
the
hero
happiness
is
blasted
because
he
finds
out
that
the
life
of
his
wife
or
his
sweetheart
has
not
always
been
spotless
as
the
snow
why
should
it
be
spotless
as
the
snow
what
is
the
hero
that
he
should
be
dowered
with
the
love
of
virgins
of
paradise
i
call
it
cant
all
that
and
i
hate
it
i
hope
angel
clare
was
eventually
entrapped
by
a
young
person
from
piccadilly
circus
she
would
probably
be
much
too
good
for
him
so
you
see
i
was
hardly
likely
to
have
put
any
very
searching
questions
to
nelly
we
had
other
things
to
talk
about
but
this
night
i
suppose
she
was
a
bit
excited
it
had
been
a
wild
and
wonderful
week
the
transition
from
that
in
the
midlands
to
the
abbey
of
theleme
was
enough
to
turn
any
head
we
had
laughed
till
we
had
grown
dizzy
the
worst
of
that
miserable
school
discipline
is
is
that
it
makes
one
take
an
insane
and
quite
disproportionate
enjoyment
in
little
things
in
the
merest
trifles
which
ought
really
to
be
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
i
assure
you
that
every
minute
that
i
spent
in
bed
after
seven
was
to
me
a
grain
of
paradise
a
moment
of
delight
of
course
it
ridiculous
let
a
man
get
up
early
or
get
up
late
as
he
likes
or
as
he
finds
best
and
say
no
more
about
it
but
at
that
wretched
lupton
early
rising
was
part
of
the
infernal
blether
and
blatter
of
the
place
that
made
life
there
like
a
long
dinner
in
which
every
dish
has
the
same
sauce
it
may
be
a
good
sauce
enough
but
one
is
sick
of
the
taste
of
it
according
to
our
bonzes
there
getting
up
early
on
a
winter
day
was
a
high
virtue
which
acquired
merit
i
believe
i
should
have
liked
a
hard
chair
to
sit
in
of
my
own
free
will
if
one
of
our
old
fools
palmer
had
not
always
been
gabbling
about
the
horrid
luxury
of
some
boys
who
had
in
their
studies
unless
you
were
doing
something
or
other
to
make
yourself
very
uncomfortable
he
used
to
say
you
were
like
the
romans
i
am
sure
he
believed
that
those
lunatics
who
bathe
in
the
serpentine
on
christmas
day
would
go
straight
to
heaven
and
there
you
are
i
would
awake
at
seven
from
persistent
habit
and
laugh
as
i
realised
that
i
was
in
little
russell
row
and
not
at
the
old
grange
then
i
would
doze
off
again
and
wake
up
at
intervals
eight
nine
ten
and
chuckle
to
myself
with
enjoyment
it
was
just
the
same
with
smoking
i
do
suppose
i
should
have
touched
a
cigarette
for
years
if
smoking
had
not
been
one
of
the
mortal
sins
in
our
bedlam
decalogue
i
do
know
whether
smoking
is
bad
for
boys
or
not
i
should
think
not
as
i
believe
the
dutch
who
are
sturdy
fellows
begin
to
puff
fat
cigars
at
the
age
of
six
or
thereabouts
but
i
do
know
that
those
pompous
old
boobies
and
blockheads
and
have
discovered
exactly
the
best
way
to
make
a
boy
think
that
a
packet
of
rosebuds
represents
the
quintessence
of
frantic
delight
well
you
see
how
it
was
how
little
russell
row
the
dingy
the
stuffy
the
dark
retreat
of
old
bloomsbury
became
the
abode
of
miraculous
joys
a
bright
portion
of
fairyland
ah
it
was
a
strong
new
wine
that
we
tasted
and
it
went
to
our
heads
and
not
much
wonder
it
all
rose
to
its
height
on
that
thursday
night
when
we
went
to
the
kings
and
sat
beneath
the
hop
bush
drinking
and
flowery
drink
as
i
talked
extravagances
concerning
panurge
it
was
time
for
the
curtain
to
be
rung
down
on
our
comedy
the
one
cigarette
had
become
three
or
four
when
nelly
began
to
tell
me
her
history
the
wine
and
the
rejoicing
had
got
into
her
head
also
she
described
the
first
things
that
she
remembered
a
little
hut
among
wild
hills
and
stony
fields
in
the
west
of
ireland
and
the
great
sea
roaring
on
the
shore
but
a
mile
away
and
the
wind
and
the
rain
always
driving
from
across
the
waves
she
spoke
of
the
place
as
if
she
loved
it
though
her
father
and
mother
were
as
poor
as
they
could
be
and
little
was
there
to
eat
even
in
the
old
cabin
she
remembered
mass
in
the
little
chapel
an
old
old
place
hidden
way
in
the
most
desolate
part
of
the
country
small
and
dark
and
bare
enough
except
for
the
candles
on
the
altar
and
a
bright
statue
or
two
kieran
cell
they
called
it
and
it
was
supposed
that
the
mass
had
never
ceased
to
be
said
there
even
in
the
blackest
days
of
persecution
quite
well
she
remembered
the
old
priest
and
his
vestments
and
the
gestures
that
he
used
and
how
they
all
bowed
down
when
the
bell
rang
she
could
imitate
his
quavering
voice
saying
the
latin
her
own
father
she
said
was
a
learned
man
in
his
way
though
it
was
not
the
english
way
he
could
not
read
common
print
or
write
he
knew
nothing
about
printed
books
but
he
could
say
a
lot
of
the
old
irish
songs
and
stories
by
heart
and
he
had
sticks
on
which
he
wrote
poems
on
all
sorts
of
things
cutting
notches
on
the
wood
in
oghams
as
the
priest
called
them
and
he
could
tell
many
wonderful
tales
of
the
saints
and
the
people
it
was
a
happy
life
altogether
they
were
as
poor
as
poor
could
be
and
praised
god
and
wanted
for
nothing
then
her
mother
went
into
a
decline
and
died
and
her
father
never
lifted
up
his
head
again
and
she
was
left
an
orphan
when
she
was
nine
years
old
the
priest
had
written
to
an
aunt
who
lived
in
england
and
so
she
found
herself
one
black
day
standing
on
the
platform
of
the
station
in
a
horrible
little
manufacturing
village
in
lancashire
everything
was
black
the
sky
and
the
earth
and
the
houses
and
the
people
and
the
sound
of
their
rough
harsh
voices
made
her
sick
and
the
aunt
had
married
an
independent
and
turned
protestant
so
she
was
black
too
nelly
thought
she
was
wretched
for
a
long
time
she
said
the
aunt
was
kind
enough
to
her
but
the
place
and
the
people
were
so
awful
deakin
the
husband
said
he
could
encourage
popery
in
his
house
so
she
had
to
go
to
the
on
sunday
and
listen
to
the
nonsense
they
called
all
long
sermons
with
horrible
shrieking
hymns
by
degrees
she
forgot
her
old
prayers
and
she
was
taken
to
the
dissenters
sunday
school
where
they
learned
texts
and
heard
about
king
solomon
temple
and
jonadab
the
son
of
rechab
and
jezebel
and
the
judges
they
seemed
to
think
a
good
deal
of
her
at
the
school
she
had
several
prizes
for
bible
knowledge
she
was
sixteen
when
she
first
went
out
to
service
she
was
glad
to
get
away
nothing
could
be
worse
than
farnworth
and
it
might
be
better
and
then
there
were
tales
to
tell
i
never
have
had
a
clearer
light
thrown
on
the
curious
and
disgusting
manners
of
the
lower
in
england
the
class
that
prides
itself
especially
on
its
respectability
above
all
on
what
it
calls
by
which
it
means
the
observance
of
one
particular
commandment
you
know
the
class
i
mean
the
brigade
of
the
shining
hat
on
sunday
of
the
neat
little
villa
with
a
plot
in
front
of
the
consecrated
of
the
big
bible
well
in
evidence
it
is
more
often
chapel
than
church
this
tribe
but
it
draws
from
both
sources
it
is
above
all
things
shiny
not
only
the
sunday
hat
but
the
furniture
the
linoleum
the
hair
and
the
very
flesh
which
pertain
to
these
people
have
an
unwholesome
polish
on
them
and
they
prefer
their
plants
and
shrubs
to
be
as
glossy
as
possible
this
to
these
tents
poor
nelly
went
as
a
slave
she
dwelt
from
henceforth
on
the
genteel
outskirts
of
more
or
less
prosperous
manufacturing
towns
and
she
soon
profoundly
regretted
the
frank
grime
and
hideousness
of
farnworth
a
hedgehog
is
a
rough
and
prickly
fellow
better
his
prickles
than
the
reptile
poisonous
slime
the
tales
that
yet
await
the
novelist
who
has
courage
what
is
his
name
by
the
way
who
has
the
insight
to
see
behind
those
venetian
blinds
and
white
curtains
who
has
the
word
that
can
give
him
entrance
through
the
polished
door
by
the
encaustic
porch
what
plots
what
pictures
what
characters
are
ready
for
his
cunning
hand
what
splendid
matter
lies
unknown
useless
and
indeed
offensive
which
in
the
artist
crucible
would
be
transmuted
into
golden
and
exquisite
perfection
do
you
know
that
i
can
never
penetrate
into
the
regions
where
these
people
dwell
without
a
thrill
of
wonder
and
a
great
desire
that
i
might
be
called
to
execute
the
masterpieces
i
have
hinted
at
do
you
remember
how
zola
viewing
these
worlds
from
the
train
when
he
visited
london
groaned
because
he
had
no
english
because
he
had
no
key
to
open
the
before
his
eyes
he
of
course
who
was
a
great
diviner
saw
the
infinite
variety
of
romance
that
was
concealed
beneath
those
myriads
of
snug
commonplace
roofs
i
wish
he
could
have
observed
in
english
and
recorded
in
french
he
was
a
brave
man
his
defence
of
dreyfus
shows
that
but
supposing
the
capacity
i
do
not
think
he
was
brave
enough
to
tell
the
london
suburbs
the
truth
about
themselves
in
their
own
tongue
yes
i
walk
down
these
long
ways
on
sunday
afternoons
when
they
are
at
their
best
sometimes
if
you
choose
the
right
hour
you
may
look
into
one
room
an
apartment
half
sunken
in
the
earth
after
another
and
see
in
each
one
the
table
laid
for
tea
showing
the
charming
order
and
uniformity
that
prevail
tea
in
the
would
be
i
suppose
a
desecration
i
wonder
what
would
happen
if
some
chance
guest
were
to
refuse
tea
and
to
ask
for
a
glass
of
beer
or
even
a
brandy
and
soda
i
suppose
the
central
lake
that
lies
many
hundreds
of
feet
beneath
london
would
rise
up
and
the
sinful
town
would
be
overwhelmed
yes
consider
these
houses
well
how
demure
how
how
shining
as
i
have
said
and
then
think
of
what
they
conceal
generally
speaking
you
know
in
the
english
suburban
sense
has
been
a
tolerably
equal
matter
i
should
imagine
that
those
romans
that
poor
old
palmer
was
always
bothering
about
were
much
better
or
worse
than
the
earlier
babylonians
and
london
as
a
whole
is
very
much
the
same
thing
in
this
respect
as
pekin
as
a
whole
modern
berlin
and
venice
might
compete
on
equal
terms
save
that
venice
i
am
sure
was
very
picturesque
and
berlin
i
have
no
doubt
is
very
piggy
the
fact
is
of
course
to
use
a
simple
analogy
man
by
his
nature
is
always
hungry
and
that
being
the
case
he
will
sometimes
eat
too
much
dinner
and
sometimes
he
will
get
his
dinner
in
odd
ways
and
sometimes
he
will
help
himself
to
more
or
less
unlawful
snacks
before
breakfast
and
after
supper
there
it
is
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
but
suppose
a
society
in
which
the
fact
of
hunger
was
officially
denied
in
which
the
faintest
hint
at
an
empty
stomach
was
considered
the
rankest
most
abominable
indecency
the
most
detestable
offence
against
the
most
sacred
religious
feelings
suppose
the
child
severely
reprimanded
at
the
mere
mention
of
bread
and
butter
whipped
and
shut
up
in
a
dark
room
for
the
offence
of
reading
a
recipe
for
making
plum
pudding
suppose
i
say
a
whole
society
organised
on
the
strict
official
understanding
that
no
decent
person
ever
is
or
has
been
or
can
be
conscious
of
the
physical
want
of
food
that
breakfast
lunch
tea
dinner
and
supper
are
orgies
only
used
by
the
most
wicked
and
degraded
wretches
destined
to
an
awful
and
eternal
doom
in
such
a
world
i
think
you
would
discover
some
very
striking
irregularities
in
diet
facts
are
known
to
be
stubborn
things
but
if
their
very
existence
is
denied
they
become
ferocious
and
terrible
things
coventry
patmore
was
angry
and
with
reason
when
he
heard
that
even
at
the
vatican
the
statues
had
received
the
order
of
the
nelly
went
among
these
manichees
she
had
been
to
the
world
beyond
the
venetians
the
white
muslin
curtains
and
the
plant
and
she
told
me
her
report
they
talk
about
the
morality
of
the
theatre
these
swine
in
the
theatre
if
there
is
anything
of
the
kind
it
is
a
case
of
a
wastrel
and
a
wanton
who
meet
and
part
on
perfectly
equal
terms
without
deceit
or
false
pretences
it
is
not
a
case
of
master
creeping
into
a
young
girl
room
at
dead
of
night
with
a
bible
under
his
arm
the
said
bible
being
used
with
grotesque
skill
to
show
that
wishes
must
be
at
once
complied
with
under
pain
of
severe
punishment
not
only
in
this
world
but
in
the
world
to
come
every
sunday
you
must
remember
the
girl
has
seen
perhaps
crouching
devoutly
in
his
pew
perhaps
in
the
part
of
sidesman
or
even
more
probably
supplementing
the
gifts
of
the
pastor
at
some
nightmarish
offers
prayer
with
wonderful
fervour
he
speaks
to
the
lord
as
man
to
man
in
the
emotional
passages
his
voice
gets
husky
and
everybody
says
how
good
he
is
he
is
a
deacon
a
guardian
of
the
poor
gracious
title
a
builder
and
an
earnest
supporter
of
the
british
and
foreign
bible
society
in
a
word
he
is
of
the
great
the
backbone
of
england
and
of
the
protestant
religion
he
subscribes
to
the
excellent
society
which
prosecutes
booksellers
for
selling
the
decameron
of
boccaccio
he
has
from
ten
to
fifteen
children
all
of
whom
were
found
by
mamma
in
the
garden
king
was
a
horrible
man
said
nelly
describing
her
first
place
had
a
great
greasy
pale
face
with
red
whiskers
and
a
shiny
bald
head
he
was
fat
too
and
when
he
smiled
it
made
one
feel
sick
soon
after
i
got
the
place
he
came
into
the
kitchen
missus
was
away
for
three
days
and
the
children
were
all
in
bed
he
sat
down
by
the
hearth
and
asked
whether
i
was
saved
and
did
i
love
the
lord
as
i
ought
to
and
if
i
ever
had
any
bad
thoughts
about
young
men
then
he
opened
the
bible
and
read
me
nasty
things
from
the
old
testament
and
asked
if
i
understood
what
it
meant
i
said
i
did
know
and
he
said
we
must
approach
the
lord
in
prayer
so
that
we
might
have
grace
to
search
the
scriptures
together
i
had
to
kneel
down
close
to
him
and
he
put
his
arm
round
my
waist
and
began
to
pray
as
he
called
it
and
when
we
got
up
he
took
me
on
his
knee
and
said
he
felt
to
me
as
if
i
were
his
own
daughter
there
that
is
enough
of
king
you
can
imagine
what
the
poor
child
had
to
go
through
time
after
time
on
nights
she
used
to
put
the
chest
of
drawers
against
her
bedroom
door
there
would
be
gentle
cautious
pushes
and
then
a
soft
voice
murmuring
child
why
is
your
heart
so
bad
and
stubborn
i
think
we
can
conceive
the
general
character
of
from
these
examples
of
course
requires
a
treatise
to
herself
her
more
frequent
failings
are
secret
drinking
and
low
amours
with
oily
commercial
travellers
yes
it
is
a
hideous
world
enough
is
it
and
is
it
a
pleasant
thought
that
you
and
i
practically
live
under
the
government
of
these
people
is
the
in
the
street
the
practical
man
of
the
world
descendant
of
the
sturdy
puritans
whose
judgment
is
final
on
all
questions
from
poetics
to
liturgiology
we
hardly
think
that
this
picture
will
commend
itself
to
the
in
the
street
a
course
of
action
that
is
calculated
to
alienate
practical
men
pleasant
is
it
locuta
est
causa
finita
i
suppose
that
by
nature
these
people
would
not
be
so
very
much
more
depraved
than
the
ordinary
african
black
fellow
their
essential
hideousness
comes
i
take
it
from
their
essential
and
most
abominable
hypocrisy
you
know
how
they
are
always
prating
about
bible
teaching
the
morality
of
the
gospel
and
all
that
nauseous
stuff
and
what
would
be
the
verdict
in
this
suburban
world
on
a
man
who
took
no
thought
for
the
morrow
who
regulated
his
life
by
the
example
of
the
lilies
who
scoffed
at
the
idea
of
saving
money
you
know
perfectly
well
that
his
relations
would
have
him
declared
a
lunatic
is
the
villainy
if
you
are
continually
professing
an
idolatrous
and
unctuous
devotion
to
a
body
of
teaching
which
you
are
also
persistently
and
perpetually
disregarding
and
disobeying
in
its
plainest
most
simple
most
elementary
injunctions
well
you
will
soon
interest
anglers
in
search
of
bait
yes
such
is
the
world
behind
the
plant
into
which
nelly
entered
i
believe
she
repelled
the
advances
of
with
success
her
final
undoing
came
from
a
different
quarter
and
i
am
afraid
that
drugs
not
biblical
cajoleries
were
the
instruments
used
she
cried
bitterly
when
she
spoke
of
this
event
but
she
said
too
will
kill
him
for
it
it
was
an
ugly
story
and
a
sad
one
alas
the
saddest
tale
i
ever
listened
to
think
of
it
to
come
from
that
old
cabin
on
the
wild
bare
hills
from
the
sound
of
the
great
sea
from
the
pure
breath
of
the
waves
and
the
wet
salt
wind
to
the
stenches
and
the
poisons
of
our
centres
she
came
from
parents
who
had
nothing
and
possessed
all
things
to
our
civilisation
which
has
everything
and
lies
on
the
that
it
has
made
at
the
very
gates
of
heaven
destitute
of
all
true
treasures
full
of
sores
and
vermin
and
corruption
she
was
nurtured
on
the
wonderful
old
legends
of
the
saints
and
the
fairies
she
had
listened
to
the
songs
that
her
father
made
and
cut
in
oghams
and
we
gave
her
the
penny
novelette
and
the
works
of
madame
chose
she
had
knelt
before
the
altar
adoring
the
most
holy
sacrifice
of
the
mass
now
she
knelt
beside
while
he
approached
the
lord
in
prayer
licking
his
fat
white
lips
i
can
imagine
no
more
terrible
transition
i
do
not
know
how
or
why
it
happened
but
as
i
listened
to
tale
my
eyes
were
opened
to
my
own
work
and
my
own
deeds
and
i
saw
for
the
first
time
my
wickedness
i
should
despair
of
explaining
to
anyone
how
utterly
innocent
i
had
been
in
intention
all
the
while
how
far
i
was
from
any
deliberate
design
of
guilt
in
a
sense
i
was
learned
and
yet
in
a
sense
i
was
most
ignorant
i
had
been
committing
what
is
doubtless
a
grievous
sin
under
the
impression
that
i
was
enjoying
the
greatest
of
all
mysteries
and
graces
and
blessings
the
great
natural
sacrament
of
human
life
did
i
not
know
i
was
doing
wrong
i
knew
that
if
any
of
the
masters
found
me
with
nelly
i
should
get
into
sad
trouble
certainly
i
knew
that
but
if
any
of
the
masters
had
caught
me
smoking
a
cigarette
or
saying
or
going
into
a
to
get
a
glass
of
beer
or
using
a
crib
or
reading
rabelais
i
should
have
got
into
sad
trouble
also
i
knew
that
i
was
sinning
against
the
of
the
great
public
school
you
may
imagine
how
deeply
i
felt
the
guilt
of
such
an
offence
as
that
and
of
course
i
had
heard
the
boys
telling
their
foolish
indecencies
but
somehow
their
nasty
talk
and
their
filthy
jokes
were
not
in
any
way
connected
in
my
mind
with
my
love
of
nelly
no
more
indeed
than
midnight
darkness
suggests
daylight
or
torment
symbolises
pleasure
indeed
there
was
a
hint
a
dim
intuition
deep
down
in
my
consciousness
that
all
was
not
well
but
i
knew
of
no
reason
for
this
i
held
it
a
morbid
dream
the
fantasy
of
an
imagination
perhaps
i
would
not
listen
to
a
faint
voice
that
seemed
without
sense
or
argument
and
now
that
voice
was
ringing
in
my
ears
with
the
clear
resonant
and
piercing
summons
of
a
trumpet
i
saw
myself
arraigned
far
down
beside
the
pestilent
horde
of
whom
i
have
just
spoken
and
indeed
my
sin
was
worse
than
theirs
for
i
had
been
bred
in
light
and
they
in
darkness
all
heedless
without
knowledge
without
preparation
without
receiving
the
mystic
word
i
had
stumbled
into
the
shrine
uninitiated
i
had
passed
beyond
the
veil
and
gazed
upon
the
hidden
mystery
on
the
secret
glory
that
is
concealed
from
the
holy
angels
woe
and
great
sorrow
were
upon
me
as
if
a
priest
devoutly
offering
the
sacrifice
were
suddenly
to
become
aware
that
he
was
uttering
all
inadvertently
hideous
and
profane
blasphemies
summoning
satan
in
place
of
the
holy
spirit
i
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
and
cried
out
in
my
anguish
do
you
know
that
i
think
nelly
was
in
a
sense
relieved
when
i
tried
to
tell
her
of
my
mistake
as
i
called
it
even
though
i
said
as
gently
as
i
could
that
it
was
all
over
she
was
relieved
because
for
the
first
time
she
felt
quite
sure
that
i
was
altogether
in
my
senses
i
can
understand
it
my
whole
attitude
must
have
struck
her
as
bordering
on
insanity
for
of
course
from
first
to
last
i
had
never
for
a
moment
taken
up
the
position
of
the
unrepentant
but
cheerful
sinner
who
knows
that
he
is
being
a
sad
dog
but
means
to
continue
in
his
naughty
way
she
with
her
evil
experience
had
thought
the
words
i
had
sometimes
uttered
not
remote
from
madness
she
wondered
she
told
me
whether
one
night
i
might
not
suddenly
take
her
throat
in
my
hands
and
strangle
her
in
a
sudden
frenzy
she
hardly
knew
whether
she
dreaded
such
a
death
or
longed
for
it
spoke
so
strangely
she
said
all
the
while
i
knew
we
were
doing
wrong
and
i
wondered
of
course
even
after
i
had
explained
the
matter
as
well
as
i
could
she
was
left
to
a
large
extent
bewildered
as
to
what
my
state
of
mind
could
have
been
still
she
saw
that
i
was
not
mad
and
she
was
relieved
as
i
have
said
i
do
not
know
how
she
was
first
drawn
to
me
how
it
was
that
she
stole
that
night
to
the
room
where
i
lay
bruised
and
aching
pity
and
desire
and
revenge
i
suppose
all
had
their
share
she
was
so
sorry
she
said
for
me
she
could
see
how
lonely
i
was
how
i
hated
the
place
and
everybody
about
it
and
she
knew
that
i
was
not
english
i
think
my
wild
welsh
face
attracted
her
too
alas
that
was
a
sad
night
after
all
our
laughter
we
had
sat
on
and
on
till
the
dawn
began
to
come
in
through
the
drawn
blinds
i
told
her
that
we
must
go
to
bed
or
we
should
never
get
up
the
next
day
we
went
into
the
bedroom
and
there
sad
and
grey
the
dawn
appeared
there
was
a
heavy
sky
covered
with
clouds
and
a
straight
soft
rain
was
pattering
on
the
leaves
of
a
great
plane
tree
opposite
heavy
drops
fell
into
the
pools
in
the
road
it
was
still
as
on
the
mountain
filled
with
infinite
sadness
and
a
sudden
step
clattering
on
the
pavement
of
the
square
beyond
made
the
stillness
seem
all
the
more
profound
i
stood
by
the
window
and
gazed
out
at
the
weeping
dripping
tree
the
rain
and
the
motionless
leaden
clouds
there
was
no
breath
of
wind
and
it
was
as
if
i
heard
the
saddest
of
all
music
tones
of
anguish
and
despair
and
notes
that
cried
and
wept
the
theme
was
given
out
itself
wet
as
it
were
with
tears
it
was
repeated
with
a
sharper
cry
a
more
piteous
supplication
it
was
with
a
bitter
utterance
and
tears
fell
faster
as
the
raindrops
fell
plashing
from
the
weeping
tree
inexorable
in
its
sad
reiterations
in
its
remorseless
development
that
music
wailed
and
grew
in
its
lamentation
in
my
own
heart
heavy
it
was
and
without
hope
heavy
as
those
still
leaden
clouds
that
hung
motionless
in
heaven
no
relief
came
to
this
sorrowing
melody
rather
a
sharper
note
of
anguish
and
then
for
a
moment
as
if
to
embitter
bitterness
sounded
a
fantastic
laughing
air
a
measure
of
jocund
pipes
and
rushing
violins
echoing
with
the
mirth
of
dancing
feet
but
it
was
beaten
into
dust
by
the
sentence
of
despair
by
doom
that
was
for
ever
by
a
sentence
pitiless
relentless
and
as
a
sudden
breath
shook
the
wet
boughs
of
the
plane
tree
and
a
torrent
fell
upon
the
road
so
the
last
notes
of
that
inner
music
were
to
me
as
a
burst
of
hopeless
weeping
i
turned
away
from
the
window
and
looked
at
the
dingy
little
room
where
we
had
laughed
so
well
it
was
a
sad
room
enough
with
its
pale
blue
paper
its
rickety
old
furniture
and
its
feeble
pictures
the
only
note
of
gaiety
was
on
the
where
poor
little
nelly
had
arranged
some
toys
and
trinkets
and
fantasies
that
she
had
bought
for
herself
in
the
last
few
days
there
was
a
brush
and
a
flagon
of
some
scent
that
i
liked
and
a
little
brooch
of
olivines
that
had
caught
her
fancy
and
a
in
a
pretty
gilt
box
the
sight
of
these
foolish
things
cut
me
to
the
heart
but
nelly
she
was
standing
by
the
bedside
half
undressed
and
she
looked
at
me
with
the
most
piteous
longing
i
think
that
she
had
really
grown
fond
of
me
i
suppose
that
i
shall
never
forget
the
sad
enchantment
of
her
face
the
flowing
of
her
beautiful
coppery
hair
about
it
and
the
tears
were
wet
on
her
cheeks
she
half
stretched
out
her
bare
arms
to
me
and
then
let
them
fall
i
had
never
known
all
her
strange
allurement
before
i
had
refined
and
symbolised
and
made
her
into
a
sign
of
joy
and
now
before
me
she
shone
disarrayed
not
a
symbol
but
a
woman
in
the
new
intelligence
that
had
come
to
me
and
i
longed
for
her
i
had
just
enough
strength
and
no
more
epilogue
it
is
unfortunate
or
fortunate
that
is
a
matter
to
be
settled
by
the
taste
of
the
reader
that
with
this
episode
of
the
visit
to
london
all
detailed
material
for
the
life
of
ambrose
meyrick
comes
to
an
end
odd
scraps
of
information
stray
notes
and
jottings
are
all
that
is
available
and
the
rest
of
meyrick
life
must
be
left
in
dim
and
somewhat
legendary
outline
personally
i
think
that
this
failure
of
documents
is
to
be
lamented
the
four
preceding
chapters
have
in
the
main
dealt
with
the
years
of
boyhood
and
therefore
with
a
multitude
of
follies
one
is
inclined
to
wonder
as
poor
nelly
wondered
whether
the
lad
was
quite
right
in
his
head
it
is
possible
that
if
we
had
fuller
information
as
to
his
later
years
we
might
be
able
to
dismiss
him
as
decidedly
eccentric
but
on
the
whole
but
after
all
i
can
not
be
confident
that
he
would
get
off
so
easily
certainly
he
did
not
repeat
the
adventure
of
little
russell
row
nor
so
far
as
i
am
aware
did
he
address
anyone
besides
his
old
schoolmaster
in
a
rabelaisian
epistle
there
are
certain
acts
of
lunacy
which
are
like
certain
acts
of
heroism
they
are
hardly
to
be
achieved
twice
by
the
same
men
but
meyrick
continued
to
do
odd
things
he
became
a
strolling
player
instead
of
becoming
a
scholar
of
balliol
if
he
had
proceeded
to
the
university
he
would
have
encountered
the
formative
and
salutary
influence
of
jowett
he
wandered
up
and
down
the
country
for
two
or
three
years
with
the
actors
and
writes
the
following
apostrophe
to
the
memory
of
his
old
company
i
take
off
my
hat
when
i
hear
the
old
music
for
i
think
of
the
old
friends
and
the
old
days
of
the
theatre
in
the
meadows
by
the
sacred
river
and
the
swelling
song
of
the
nightingales
on
sweet
spring
nights
there
is
no
doubt
that
we
may
safely
hold
with
plato
his
opinion
and
safely
may
we
believe
that
all
brave
earthly
shows
are
but
broken
copies
and
dim
lineaments
of
immortal
things
therefore
i
hope
and
trust
that
i
shall
again
be
gathered
unto
the
true
hathaway
company
sursum
which
is
the
purged
and
exalted
image
of
the
lower
which
plays
for
ever
a
great
mystery
in
the
theatre
of
the
meadows
of
asphodel
which
wanders
by
the
happy
shining
streams
and
drinks
from
an
eternal
cup
in
a
high
and
blissful
and
everlasting
tavern
cara
sodalitas
ave
thus
does
he
translate
into
wild
speech
hair
and
grease
paints
dirty
and
dirtier
lodgings
and
when
his
strolling
days
were
over
he
settled
down
in
london
paying
occasional
visits
to
his
old
home
in
the
west
he
wrote
three
or
four
books
which
are
curious
and
interesting
in
their
way
though
they
will
never
be
popular
and
finally
he
went
on
a
strange
errand
to
the
east
and
from
the
east
there
was
for
him
no
returning
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
speaks
of
a
celtic
cup
which
had
been
preserved
in
one
family
for
many
hundred
years
on
the
death
of
the
last
keeper
this
cup
was
placed
in
meyrick
charge
he
received
it
with
the
condition
that
it
was
to
be
taken
to
a
certain
concealed
shrine
in
asia
and
there
deposited
in
hands
that
would
know
how
to
hide
its
glories
for
ever
from
the
evil
world
he
went
on
this
journey
into
unknown
regions
travelling
by
ragged
roads
and
mountain
passes
by
the
sandy
wilderness
and
the
mighty
river
and
he
forded
his
way
by
the
quaking
and
dubious
track
that
winds
in
and
out
among
the
dangers
and
desolations
of
the
the
great
salt
slough
he
came
at
last
to
the
place
appointed
and
gave
the
word
and
the
treasure
to
those
who
know
how
to
wear
a
mask
and
to
keep
well
the
things
which
are
committed
to
them
and
then
set
out
on
his
journey
back
he
had
reached
a
point
not
very
far
from
the
gates
of
west
and
halted
for
a
day
or
two
amongst
christians
being
tired
out
with
a
weary
pilgrimage
but
the
turks
or
the
kurds
it
does
not
matter
which
descended
on
the
place
and
worked
their
customary
works
and
so
ambrose
was
taken
by
them
one
of
the
native
christians
who
had
hidden
himself
from
the
miscreants
told
afterwards
how
he
saw
the
stranger
ambrosian
brought
out
and
how
they
held
before
him
the
image
of
the
crucified
that
he
might
spit
upon
it
and
trample
it
under
his
feet
but
he
kissed
the
icon
with
great
joy
and
penitence
and
devotion
so
they
bore
him
to
a
tree
outside
the
village
and
crucified
him
there
and
after
he
had
hung
on
the
tree
some
hours
the
infidels
enraged
as
it
is
said
by
the
shining
rapture
of
his
face
killed
him
with
their
spears
it
was
in
this
manner
that
ambrose
meyrick
gained
red
martyrdom
and
achieved
the
most
glorious
quest
and
adventure
of
the
sangraal
