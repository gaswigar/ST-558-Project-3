the
fortune
of
the
rougons
by
emile
zola
edited
with
introduction
by
ernest
alfred
vizetelly
introduction
the
fortune
of
the
rougons
is
the
initial
volume
of
the
series
though
it
was
by
no
means
zola
s
first
essay
in
fiction
it
was
undoubtedly
his
first
great
bid
for
genuine
literary
fame
and
the
foundation
of
what
must
necessarily
be
regarded
as
his
the
idea
of
writing
the
natural
and
social
history
of
a
family
under
the
second
empire
extending
to
a
score
of
volumes
was
doubtless
suggested
to
zola
by
balzac
s
immortal
comedie
he
was
years
of
age
when
this
idea
first
occurred
to
him
he
was
when
he
at
last
sent
the
manuscript
of
his
concluding
volume
dr
pascal
to
the
press
he
had
spent
years
in
working
out
his
scheme
persevering
with
it
doggedly
and
stubbornly
whatever
rebuffs
he
might
encounter
whatever
jeers
and
whatever
insults
might
be
directed
against
him
by
the
ignorant
the
prejudiced
and
the
hypocritical
truth
was
on
the
march
and
nothing
could
stay
it
even
as
at
the
present
hour
its
march
if
slow
none
the
less
continues
athwart
another
and
a
different
crisis
of
the
illustrious
novelist
s
career
it
was
in
the
early
summer
of
that
zola
first
began
the
actual
writing
of
the
fortune
of
the
it
was
only
in
the
following
year
however
that
the
serial
publication
of
the
work
commenced
in
the
columns
of
le
siecle
the
republican
journal
of
most
influence
in
paris
in
those
days
of
the
second
empire
the
war
interrupted
this
issue
of
the
story
and
publication
in
book
form
did
not
take
place
until
the
latter
half
of
a
time
when
both
the
war
and
the
commune
had
left
paris
exhausted
supine
with
little
or
no
interest
in
anything
no
more
unfavourable
moment
for
the
issue
of
an
ambitious
work
of
fiction
could
have
been
found
some
two
or
three
years
went
by
as
i
well
remember
before
anything
like
a
revival
of
literature
and
of
public
interest
in
literature
took
place
thus
zola
launched
his
gigantic
scheme
under
auspices
which
would
have
made
many
another
man
recoil
the
fortune
of
the
rougons
and
two
or
three
subsequent
volumes
of
his
series
attracted
but
a
moderate
degree
of
attention
and
it
was
only
on
the
morrow
of
the
publication
of
l
assommoir
that
he
awoke
like
byron
to
find
himself
famous
as
previously
mentioned
the
series
forms
twenty
volumes
the
last
of
these
dr
pascal
appeared
in
since
then
zola
has
written
lourdes
rome
and
critics
have
repeated
that
these
last
works
constitute
a
new
departure
on
zola
s
part
and
so
far
as
they
formed
a
new
series
this
is
true
but
the
suggestion
that
he
has
in
any
way
repented
of
the
novels
is
ridiculous
as
he
has
often
told
me
of
recent
years
it
is
as
far
as
possible
his
plan
to
subordinate
his
style
and
methods
to
his
subject
to
have
written
a
book
like
rome
so
largely
devoted
to
the
ambitions
of
the
papal
see
in
the
same
way
as
he
had
written
books
dealing
with
the
drunkenness
or
other
vices
of
paris
would
have
been
the
climax
of
absurdity
yet
the
publication
of
rome
was
the
signal
for
a
general
outcry
on
the
part
of
english
and
american
reviewers
that
zolaism
as
typified
by
the
series
was
altogether
a
thing
of
the
past
to
my
thinking
this
is
a
profound
error
zola
has
always
remained
faithful
to
himself
the
only
difference
that
i
perceive
between
his
latest
work
paris
and
certain
volumes
is
that
with
time
experience
and
assiduity
his
genius
has
expanded
and
ripened
and
that
the
hesitation
the
groping
for
truth
so
to
say
which
may
be
found
in
some
of
his
earlier
writings
has
disappeared
at
the
time
when
the
fortune
of
the
rougons
was
first
published
none
but
the
author
himself
can
have
imagined
that
the
of
one
of
the
great
literary
monuments
of
the
century
had
just
been
laid
from
the
story
point
of
view
the
book
is
one
of
zola
s
very
best
although
its
construction
particularly
as
regards
the
long
interlude
of
the
idyll
of
miette
and
silvere
is
far
from
being
perfect
such
a
work
when
first
issued
might
well
bring
its
author
a
measure
of
popularity
but
it
could
hardly
confer
fame
nowadays
however
looking
backward
and
bearing
in
mind
that
one
here
has
the
genius
of
zola
s
lifework
the
fortune
of
the
rougons
becomes
a
book
of
exceptional
interest
and
importance
this
has
been
so
well
understood
by
french
readers
that
during
the
last
six
or
seven
years
the
annual
sales
of
the
work
have
increased
threefold
where
over
a
course
of
twenty
years
copies
were
sold
and
are
sold
how
many
living
english
novelists
can
say
the
same
of
their
early
essays
in
fiction
issued
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
i
may
here
mention
that
at
the
last
date
to
which
i
have
authentic
figures
that
is
midsummer
prior
of
course
to
what
is
called
l
affaire
dreyfus
there
had
been
sold
of
the
entire
series
which
had
begun
in
copies
these
were
of
the
ordinary
charpentier
editions
of
the
french
originals
by
adding
thereto
several
de
and
the
popular
illustrated
editions
of
certain
volumes
the
total
amounts
roundly
to
rome
lourdes
paris
and
all
zola
s
other
works
apart
from
the
series
together
with
the
translations
into
a
dozen
different
languages
english
german
italian
spanish
dutch
danish
portuguese
bohemian
hungarian
and
others
are
not
included
in
the
above
figures
otherwise
the
latter
might
well
be
doubled
nor
is
account
taken
of
the
many
serial
issues
which
have
brought
zola
s
views
to
the
knowledge
of
the
masses
of
all
europe
it
is
of
course
the
celebrity
attaching
to
certain
of
zola
s
literary
efforts
that
has
stimulated
the
demand
for
his
other
writings
among
those
which
are
well
worthy
of
being
read
for
their
own
sakes
i
would
assign
a
prominent
place
to
the
present
volume
much
of
the
story
element
in
it
is
admirable
and
further
it
shows
zola
as
a
genuine
satirist
and
humorist
the
rougons
yellow
and
its
habitues
and
many
of
the
scenes
between
pierre
rougon
and
his
wife
felicite
are
worthy
of
the
pen
of
douglas
jerrold
the
whole
account
indeed
of
the
town
of
plassans
its
customs
and
its
notabilities
is
satire
of
the
most
effective
kind
because
it
is
satire
true
to
life
and
never
degenerates
into
mere
caricature
it
is
a
rather
curious
coincidence
that
at
the
time
when
zola
was
thus
portraying
the
life
of
provence
his
great
contemporary
bosom
friend
and
rival
for
literary
fame
the
late
alphonse
daudet
should
have
been
producing
under
the
title
of
the
provencal
don
quixote
that
unrivalled
presentment
of
the
foibles
of
the
french
southerner
with
everyone
nowadays
knows
as
tartarin
of
it
is
possible
that
zola
while
writing
his
book
may
have
read
the
instalments
of
le
don
quichotte
provencal
published
in
the
paris
figaro
and
it
may
be
that
this
perusal
imparted
that
fillip
to
his
pen
to
which
we
owe
the
many
amusing
particulars
that
he
gives
us
of
the
town
of
plassans
plassans
i
may
mention
is
really
the
provencal
aix
which
zola
s
father
provided
with
water
by
means
of
a
canal
still
bearing
his
name
zola
himself
though
born
in
paris
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
childhood
there
tarascon
as
is
well
known
never
forgave
alphonse
daudet
for
his
tartarin
and
in
a
like
way
zola
who
doubtless
counts
more
enemies
than
any
other
literary
man
of
the
period
has
none
bitterer
than
the
worthy
citizens
of
aix
they
can
not
forget
or
forgive
the
rascally
the
name
has
to
me
always
suggested
that
splendid
and
amusing
type
of
the
cynical
rogue
robert
macaire
but
of
course
both
rougon
and
macquart
are
genuine
french
names
and
not
inventions
indeed
several
years
ago
i
came
by
chance
upon
them
both
in
an
old
french
deed
which
i
was
examining
at
the
bibliotheque
nationale
in
paris
i
there
found
mention
of
a
rougon
family
and
a
macquart
family
dwelling
virtually
side
by
side
in
the
same
village
this
however
was
in
champagne
not
in
provence
both
families
farmed
vineyards
for
a
once
famous
abbey
in
the
vicinity
of
epernay
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
to
me
personally
this
trivial
discovery
meant
a
great
deal
it
somehow
aroused
my
interest
in
zola
and
his
works
of
the
latter
i
had
then
only
glanced
through
two
or
three
volumes
with
zola
himself
i
was
absolutely
unacquainted
however
i
took
the
liberty
to
inform
him
of
my
little
discovery
and
afterwards
i
read
all
the
books
that
he
had
published
now
as
it
is
fairly
well
known
i
have
given
the
greater
part
of
my
time
for
several
years
past
to
the
task
of
familiarising
english
readers
with
his
writings
an
old
deed
a
chance
glance
followed
by
the
great
friendship
of
my
life
and
years
of
patient
labour
if
i
mention
this
matter
it
is
solely
with
the
object
of
endorsing
the
truth
of
the
saying
that
the
most
insignificant
incidents
frequently
influence
and
even
shape
our
careers
but
i
must
come
back
to
the
fortune
of
the
it
has
as
i
have
said
its
satirical
and
humorous
side
but
it
also
contains
a
strong
element
of
pathos
the
idyll
of
miette
and
silvere
is
a
very
touching
one
and
quite
in
accord
with
the
conditions
of
life
prevailing
in
provence
at
the
period
zola
selects
for
his
narrative
miette
is
a
frank
child
of
nature
silvere
her
lover
in
certain
respects
foreshadows
a
quarter
of
a
century
in
advance
the
abbe
pierre
fromont
of
lourdes
rome
and
the
environment
differs
of
course
but
germs
of
the
same
nature
may
readily
be
detected
in
both
characters
as
for
the
other
personages
of
zola
s
book
on
the
one
hand
aunt
dide
pierre
rougon
his
wife
felicite
and
their
sons
eugene
aristide
and
pascal
and
on
the
other
macquart
his
daughter
gervaise
of
l
assommoir
and
his
son
jean
of
la
terre
and
la
debacle
together
with
the
members
of
the
mouret
branch
of
the
ravenous
neurotic
duplex
family
these
are
analysed
or
sketched
in
a
way
which
renders
their
subsequent
careers
as
related
in
other
volumes
of
the
series
thoroughly
consistent
with
their
origin
and
their
i
venture
to
asset
that
although
it
is
possible
to
read
individual
volumes
of
the
series
while
neglecting
others
nobody
can
really
understand
any
one
of
these
books
unless
he
makes
himself
acquainted
with
the
alpha
and
the
omega
of
the
edifice
that
is
the
fortune
of
the
rougons
and
dr
with
regard
to
the
present
english
translation
it
is
based
on
one
made
for
my
father
several
years
ago
but
to
convey
zola
s
meaning
more
accurately
i
have
found
it
necessary
to
alter
on
an
average
at
least
one
sentence
out
of
every
three
thus
though
i
only
claim
to
edit
the
volume
it
is
to
all
intents
and
purposes
quite
a
new
english
version
of
zola
s
work
merton
surrey
august
author
s
preface
i
wish
to
explain
how
a
family
a
small
group
of
human
beings
conducts
itself
in
a
given
social
system
after
blossoming
forth
and
giving
birth
to
ten
or
twenty
members
who
though
they
may
appear
at
the
first
glance
profoundly
dissimilar
one
from
the
other
are
as
analysis
demonstrates
most
closely
linked
together
from
the
point
of
view
of
affinity
heredity
like
gravity
has
its
laws
by
resolving
the
duplex
question
of
temperament
and
environment
i
shall
endeavour
to
discover
and
follow
the
thread
of
connection
which
leads
mathematically
from
one
man
to
another
and
when
i
have
possession
of
every
thread
and
hold
a
complete
social
group
in
my
hands
i
shall
show
this
group
at
work
participating
in
an
historical
period
i
shall
depict
it
in
action
with
all
its
varied
energies
and
i
shall
analyse
both
the
will
power
of
each
member
and
the
general
tendency
of
the
whole
the
great
characteristic
of
the
the
group
or
family
which
i
propose
to
study
is
their
ravenous
appetite
the
great
outburst
of
our
age
which
rushes
upon
enjoyment
physiologically
the
represent
the
slow
succession
of
accidents
pertaining
to
the
nerves
or
the
blood
which
befall
a
race
after
the
first
organic
lesion
and
according
to
environment
determine
in
each
individual
member
of
the
race
those
feelings
desires
and
passions
briefly
all
the
natural
and
instinctive
manifestations
peculiar
to
humanity
whose
outcome
assumes
the
conventional
name
of
virtue
or
vice
historically
the
proceed
from
the
masses
radiate
throughout
the
whole
of
contemporary
society
and
ascend
to
all
sorts
of
positions
by
the
force
of
that
impulsion
of
essentially
modern
origin
which
sets
the
lower
classes
marching
through
the
social
system
and
thus
the
dramas
of
their
individual
lives
recount
the
story
of
the
second
empire
from
the
ambuscade
of
the
coup
d
etat
to
the
treachery
of
sedan
for
three
years
i
had
been
collecting
the
necessary
documents
for
this
long
work
and
the
present
volume
was
even
written
when
the
fall
of
the
bonapartes
which
i
needed
artistically
and
with
as
if
by
fate
i
ever
found
at
the
end
of
the
drama
without
daring
to
hope
that
it
would
prove
so
near
at
hand
suddenly
occurred
and
furnished
me
with
the
terrible
but
necessary
denouement
for
my
work
my
scheme
is
at
this
date
completed
the
circle
in
which
my
characters
will
revolve
is
perfected
and
my
work
becomes
a
picture
of
a
departed
reign
of
a
strange
period
of
human
madness
and
shame
this
work
which
will
comprise
several
episodes
is
therefore
in
my
mind
the
natural
and
social
history
of
a
family
under
the
second
empire
and
the
first
episode
here
called
the
fortune
of
the
rougons
should
scientifically
be
entitled
the
emile

paris
july
the
fortune
of
the
rougons
chapter
i
on
quitting
plassans
by
the
rome
gate
on
the
southern
side
of
the
town
you
will
find
on
the
right
side
of
the
road
to
nice
and
a
little
way
past
the
first
suburban
houses
a
plot
of
land
locally
known
as
the
aire
this
aire
is
of
oblong
shape
and
on
a
level
with
the
footpath
of
the
adjacent
road
from
which
it
is
separated
by
a
strip
of
trodden
grass
a
narrow
blind
alley
fringed
with
a
row
of
hovels
borders
it
on
the
right
while
on
the
left
and
at
the
further
end
it
is
closed
in
by
bits
of
wall
overgrown
with
moss
above
which
can
be
seen
the
top
branches
of
the
of
the
an
extensive
property
with
an
entrance
lower
down
the
road
enclosed
upon
three
sides
the
aire
leads
nowhere
and
is
only
crossed
by
people
out
for
a
stroll
in
former
times
it
was
a
cemetery
under
the
patronage
of
a
greatly
honoured
provencal
saint
and
in
the
old
people
of
plassans
could
still
remember
having
seen
the
wall
of
the
cemetery
standing
although
the
place
itself
had
been
closed
for
years
the
soil
had
been
so
glutted
with
corpses
that
it
had
been
found
necessary
to
open
a
new
at
the
other
end
of
town
then
the
old
abandoned
cemetery
had
been
gradually
purified
by
the
dark
vegetation
which
had
sprouted
over
it
every
spring
the
rich
soil
in
which
the
gravediggers
could
no
longer
delve
without
turning
up
some
human
remains
was
possessed
of
wondrous
fertility
the
tall
weeds
overtopped
the
walls
after
the
may
rains
and
the
june
sunshine
so
as
to
be
visible
from
the
high
road
while
inside
the
place
presented
the
appearance
of
a
deep
dark
green
sea
studded
with
large
blossoms
of
singular
brilliancy
beneath
one
s
feet
amidst
the
stalks
one
could
feel
that
the
damp
soil
reeked
and
bubbled
with
sap
among
the
curiosities
of
the
place
at
that
time
were
some
large
with
twisted
and
knotty
boughs
but
none
of
the
housewives
of
plassans
cared
to
pluck
the
large
fruit
which
grew
upon
them
indeed
the
townspeople
spoke
of
this
fruit
with
grimaces
of
disgust
no
such
delicacy
however
restrained
the
suburban
urchins
who
assembled
in
bands
at
twilight
and
climbed
the
walls
to
steal
the
pears
even
before
they
were
ripe
the
trees
and
the
weeds
with
their
vigorous
growth
had
rapidly
assimilated
all
the
decomposing
matter
in
the
old
cemetery
of
the
malaria
rising
from
the
human
remains
interred
there
had
been
greedily
absorbed
by
the
flowers
and
the
fruit
so
that
eventually
the
only
odour
one
could
detect
in
passing
by
was
the
strong
perfume
of
wild
gillyflowers
this
had
merely
been
a
question
of
a
few
summers
at
last
the
townspeople
determined
to
utilise
this
common
property
which
had
long
served
no
purpose
the
walls
bordering
the
roadway
and
the
blind
alley
were
pulled
down
the
weeds
and
the
uprooted
the
sepulchral
remains
were
removed
the
ground
was
dug
deep
and
such
bones
as
the
earth
was
willing
to
surrender
were
heaped
up
in
a
corner
for
nearly
a
month
the
youngsters
who
lamented
the
loss
of
the
played
at
bowls
with
the
skulls
and
one
night
some
practical
jokers
even
suspended
femurs
and
tibias
to
all
the
of
the
town
this
scandal
which
is
still
remembered
at
plassans
did
not
cease
until
the
authorities
decided
to
have
the
bones
shot
into
a
hole
which
had
been
dug
for
the
purpose
in
the
new
cemetery
all
work
however
is
usually
carried
out
with
discreet
dilatoriness
in
country
towns
and
so
during
an
entire
week
the
inhabitants
saw
a
solitary
cart
removing
these
human
remains
as
if
they
had
been
mere
rubbish
the
vehicle
had
to
cross
plassans
from
end
to
end
and
owing
to
the
bad
condition
of
the
roads
fragments
of
bones
and
handfuls
of
rich
mould
were
scattered
at
every
jolt
there
was
not
the
briefest
religious
ceremony
nothing
but
slow
and
brutish
cartage
never
before
had
a
town
felt
so
disgusted
for
several
years
the
old
cemetery
remained
an
object
of
terror
although
it
adjoined
the
main
thoroughfare
and
was
open
to
all
comers
it
was
left
quite
deserted
a
prey
to
fresh
vegetable
growth
the
local
authorities
who
had
doubtless
counted
on
selling
it
and
seeing
houses
built
upon
it
were
evidently
unable
to
find
a
purchaser
the
recollection
of
the
heaps
of
bones
and
the
cart
persistently
jolting
through
the
streets
may
have
made
people
recoil
from
the
spot
or
perhaps
the
indifference
that
was
shown
was
due
to
the
indolence
the
repugnance
to
pulling
down
and
setting
up
again
which
is
characteristic
of
country
people
at
all
events
the
authorities
still
retained
possession
of
the
ground
and
at
last
forgot
their
desire
to
dispose
of
it
they
did
not
even
erect
a
fence
round
it
but
left
it
open
to
all
comers
then
as
time
rolled
on
people
gradually
grew
accustomed
to
this
barren
spot
they
would
sit
on
the
grass
at
the
edges
walk
about
or
gather
in
groups
when
the
grass
had
been
worn
away
and
the
trodden
soil
had
become
grey
and
hard
the
old
cemetery
resembled
a
public
square
as
if
the
more
effectually
to
efface
the
memory
of
all
objectionable
associations
the
inhabitants
slowly
changed
the
very
appellation
of
the
place
retaining
but
the
name
of
the
saint
which
was
likewise
applied
to
the
blind
alley
dipping
down
at
one
corner
of
the
field
thus
there
was
the
aire
and
the
impasse
all
this
dates
however
from
some
considerable
time
back
for
more
than
thirty
years
now
the
aire
has
presented
a
different
appearance
one
day
the
townspeople
far
too
inert
and
indifferent
to
derive
any
advantage
from
it
let
it
for
a
trifling
consideration
to
some
suburban
wheelwrights
who
turned
it
into
a
at
the
present
day
it
is
still
littered
with
huge
pieces
of
timber
thirty
or
forty
feet
long
lying
here
and
there
in
piles
and
looking
like
lofty
overturned
columns
these
piles
of
timber
disposed
at
intervals
from
one
end
of
the
yard
to
the
other
are
a
continual
source
of
delight
to
the
local
urchins
in
some
places
the
ground
is
covered
with
fallen
wood
forming
a
kind
of
uneven
flooring
over
which
it
is
impossible
to
walk
unless
one
balance
one
s
self
with
marvellous
dexterity
troops
of
children
amuse
themselves
with
this
exercise
all
day
long
you
will
see
them
jumping
over
the
big
beams
walking
in
indian
file
along
the
narrow
ends
or
else
crawling
astride
them
various
games
which
generally
terminate
in
blows
and
bellowings
sometimes
too
a
dozen
of
them
will
sit
closely
packed
one
against
the
other
on
the
thin
end
of
a
pole
raised
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
and
will
there
for
hours
together
the
aire
thus
serves
as
a
recreation
ground
where
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
all
the
little
suburban
ragamuffins
have
been
in
the
habit
of
wearing
out
the
seats
of
their
breeches
the
strangeness
of
the
place
is
increased
by
the
circumstance
that
wandering
gipsies
by
a
sort
of
traditional
custom
always
select
the
vacant
portions
of
it
for
their
encampments
whenever
any
caravan
arrives
at
plassans
it
takes
up
its
quarters
on
the
aire
the
place
is
consequently
never
empty
there
is
always
some
strange
band
there
some
troop
of
wild
men
and
withered
women
among
whom
groups
of
children
roll
about
on
the
grass
these
people
live
in
the
open
air
regardless
of
everybody
setting
their
pots
boiling
eating
nameless
things
freely
displaying
their
tattered
garments
and
sleeping
fighting
kissing
and
reeking
with
mingled
filth
and
misery
the
field
formerly
so
still
and
deserted
save
for
the
buzzing
of
hornets
around
the
rich
blossoms
in
the
heavy
sunshine
has
thus
become
a
very
rowdy
spot
resounding
with
the
noisy
quarrels
of
the
gipsies
and
the
shrill
cries
of
the
urchins
of
the
suburb
in
one
corner
there
is
a
primitive
for
cutting
the
timber
the
noise
from
which
serves
as
a
dull
continuous
bass
accompaniment
to
the
sharp
voices
the
wood
is
placed
on
two
high
tressels
and
a
couple
of
sawyers
one
of
whom
stands
aloft
on
the
timber
itself
while
the
other
underneath
is
half
blinded
by
the
falling
sawdust
work
a
large
saw
to
and
fro
for
hours
together
with
rigid
regularity
as
if
they
were
puppets
the
wood
they
saw
is
stacked
plank
by
plank
along
the
wall
at
the
end
in
carefully
arranged
piles
six
or
eight
feet
high
which
often
remain
there
several
seasons
and
constitute
one
of
the
charms
of
the
aire
between
these
stacks
are
mysterious
retired
little
alleys
leading
to
a
broader
path
between
the
timber
and
the
wall
a
deserted
strip
of
verdure
whence
only
small
patches
of
sky
can
be
seen
the
vigorous
vegetation
and
the
quivering
deathlike
stillness
of
the
old
cemetery
still
reign
in
this
path
in
all
the
country
round
plassans
there
is
no
spot
more
instinct
with
languor
solitude
and
love
it
is
a
most
delightful
place
for
when
the
cemetery
was
being
cleared
the
bones
must
have
been
heaped
up
in
this
corner
for
even
it
frequently
happens
that
one
s
foot
comes
across
some
fragment
of
a
skull
lying
concealed
in
the
damp
turf
nobody
however
now
thinks
of
the
bodies
that
once
slept
under
that
turf
in
the
daytime
only
the
children
go
behind
the
piles
of
wood
when
playing
at
hide
and
seek
the
green
path
remains
virginal
unknown
to
others
who
see
nought
but
the
crowded
with
timber
and
grey
with
dust
in
the
morning
and
afternoon
when
the
sun
is
warm
the
whole
place
swarms
with
life
above
all
the
turmoil
above
the
ragamuffins
playing
among
the
timber
and
the
gipsies
kindling
fires
under
their
cauldrons
the
sharp
silhouette
of
the
sawyer
mounted
on
his
beam
stands
out
against
the
sky
moving
to
and
fro
with
the
precision
of
clockwork
as
if
to
regulate
the
busy
activity
that
has
sprung
up
in
this
spot
once
set
apart
for
eternal
slumber
only
the
old
people
who
sit
on
the
planks
basking
in
the
setting
sun
speak
occasionally
among
themselves
of
the
bones
which
they
once
saw
carted
through
the
streets
of
plassans
by
the
legendary
tumbrel
when
night
falls
the
aire
loses
its
animation
and
looks
like
some
great
black
hole
at
the
far
end
one
may
just
espy
the
dying
embers
of
the
gipsies
fires
and
at
times
shadows
slink
noiselessly
into
the
dense
darkness
the
place
becomes
quite
sinister
particularly
in
winter
time
one
sunday
evening
at
about
seven
o
clock
a
young
man
stepped
lightly
from
the
impasse
and
closely
skirting
the
walls
took
his
way
among
the
timber
in
the
it
was
in
the
early
part
of
december
the
weather
was
dry
and
cold
the
full
moon
shone
with
that
sharp
brilliancy
peculiar
to
winter
moons
the
did
not
have
the
forbidding
appearance
which
it
wears
on
rainy
nights
illumined
by
stretches
of
white
light
and
wrapped
in
deep
and
chilly
silence
it
spread
around
with
a
soft
melancholy
aspect
for
a
few
seconds
the
young
man
paused
on
the
edge
of
the
yard
and
gazed
mistrustfully
in
front
of
him
he
carried
a
long
gun
the
of
which
was
hidden
under
his
jacket
while
the
barrel
pointed
towards
the
ground
glittered
in
the
moonlight
pressing
the
weapon
to
his
side
he
attentively
examined
the
square
shadows
cast
by
the
piles
of
timber
the
ground
looked
like
a
with
black
and
white
squares
clearly
defined
by
alternate
patches
of
light
and
shade
the
sawyers
tressels
in
the
centre
of
the
plot
threw
long
narrow
fantastic
shadows
suggesting
some
huge
geometrical
figure
upon
a
strip
of
bare
grey
ground
the
rest
of
the
yard
the
flooring
of
beams
formed
a
great
couch
on
which
the
light
reposed
streaked
here
and
there
with
the
slender
black
shadows
which
edged
the
different
pieces
of
timber
in
the
frigid
silence
under
the
wintry
moon
the
motionless
recumbent
poles
stiffened
as
it
were
with
sleep
and
cold
recalled
the
corpses
of
the
old
cemetery
the
young
man
cast
but
a
rapid
glance
round
the
empty
space
there
was
not
a
creature
not
a
sound
no
danger
of
being
seen
or
heard
the
black
patches
at
the
further
end
caused
him
more
anxiety
but
after
a
brief
examination
he
plucked
up
courage
and
hurriedly
crossed
the
as
soon
as
he
felt
himself
under
cover
he
slackened
his
pace
he
was
now
in
the
green
pathway
skirting
the
wall
behind
the
piles
of
planks
here
his
very
footsteps
became
inaudible
the
frozen
grass
scarcely
crackled
under
his
tread
he
must
have
loved
the
spot
have
feared
no
danger
sought
nothing
but
what
was
pleasant
there
he
no
longer
concealed
his
gun
the
path
stretched
away
like
a
dark
trench
except
that
the
moonrays
gliding
ever
and
anon
between
the
piles
of
timber
then
streaked
the
grass
with
patches
of
light
all
slept
both
darkness
and
light
with
the
same
deep
soft
sad
slumber
no
words
can
describe
the
calm
peacefulness
of
the
place
the
young
man
went
right
down
the
path
and
stopped
at
the
end
where
the
walls
of
the
form
an
angle
here
he
listened
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
any
sound
might
be
coming
from
the
adjoining
estate
at
last
hearing
nothing
he
stooped
down
thrust
a
plank
aside
and
hid
his
gun
in
a
an
old
tombstone
which
had
been
overlooked
in
the
clearing
of
the
lay
in
the
corner
resting
on
its
side
and
forming
a
high
and
slightly
sloping
seat
the
rain
had
worn
its
edges
and
moss
was
slowly
eating
into
it
nevertheless
the
following
fragment
of
an
inscription
cut
on
the
side
which
was
sinking
into
the
ground
might
still
have
been
distinguished
in
the
moonlight
lieth
marie
died
the
finger
of
time
had
effaced
the
rest
when
the
young
man
had
concealed
his
gun
he
again
listened
attentively
and
still
hearing
nothing
resolved
to
climb
upon
the
stone
the
wall
being
low
he
was
able
to
rest
his
elbows
on
the
coping
he
could
however
perceive
nothing
except
a
flood
of
light
beyond
the
row
of
skirting
the
wall
the
flat
ground
of
the
spread
out
under
the
moon
like
an
immense
sheet
of
unbleached
linen
a
hundred
yards
away
the
farmhouse
and
its
outbuildings
formed
a
still
whiter
patch
the
young
man
was
still
gazing
anxiously
in
that
direction
when
suddenly
one
of
the
town
clocks
slowly
and
solemnly
struck
seven
he
counted
the
strokes
and
then
jumped
down
apparently
surprised
and
relieved
he
seated
himself
on
the
tombstone
like
one
who
is
prepared
to
wait
some
considerable
time
and
for
about
half
an
hour
he
remained
motionless
and
deep
in
thought
apparently
quite
unconscious
of
the
cold
while
his
eyes
gazed
fixedly
at
a
mass
of
shadow
he
had
placed
himself
in
a
dark
corner
but
the
beams
of
the
rising
moon
had
gradually
reached
him
and
at
last
his
head
was
in
the
full
light
he
was
a
strong
lad
with
a
fine
mouth
and
soft
delicate
skin
that
bespoke
youthfulness
he
looked
about
seventeen
years
of
age
and
was
handsome
in
a
characteristic
way
his
thin
long
face
looked
like
the
work
of
some
master
sculptor
his
high
forehead
overhanging
brows
aquiline
nose
broad
flat
chin
and
protruding
cheek
bones
gave
singularly
bold
relief
to
his
countenance
such
a
face
would
with
advancing
age
become
too
bony
as
fleshless
as
that
of
a
knight
errant
but
at
this
stage
of
youth
with
chin
and
cheek
lightly
covered
with
soft
down
its
latent
harshness
was
attenuated
by
the
charming
softness
of
certain
contours
which
had
remained
vague
and
childlike
his
soft
black
eyes
still
full
of
youth
also
lent
delicacy
to
his
otherwise
vigorous
countenance
the
young
fellow
would
probably
not
have
fascinated
all
women
as
he
was
not
what
one
calls
a
handsome
man
but
his
features
as
a
whole
expressed
such
ardent
and
sympathetic
life
such
enthusiasm
and
energy
that
they
doubtless
engaged
the
thoughts
of
the
girls
of
his
own
part
those
sunburnt
girls
of
the
south
as
he
passed
their
doors
on
sultry
july
evenings
he
remained
seated
upon
the
tombstone
wrapped
in
thought
and
apparently
quite
unconscious
of
the
moonlight
which
now
fell
upon
his
chest
and
legs
he
was
of
middle
stature
rather
with
arms
and
a
labourer
s
hands
already
hardened
by
toil
his
feet
shod
with
heavy
laced
boots
looked
large
and
his
general
appearance
more
particularly
the
heaviness
of
his
limbs
bespoke
lowly
origin
there
was
however
something
in
him
in
the
upright
bearing
of
his
neck
and
the
thoughtful
gleams
of
his
eyes
which
seemed
to
indicate
an
inner
revolt
against
the
brutifying
manual
labour
which
was
beginning
to
bend
him
to
the
ground
he
was
no
doubt
an
intelligent
nature
buried
beneath
the
oppressive
burden
of
race
and
class
one
of
those
delicate
refined
minds
embedded
in
a
rough
envelope
from
which
they
in
vain
struggle
to
free
themselves
thus
in
spite
of
his
vigour
he
seemed
timid
and
restless
feeling
a
kind
of
unconscious
shame
at
his
imperfection
an
honest
lad
he
doubtless
was
whose
very
ignorance
had
generated
enthusiasm
whose
manly
heart
was
impelled
by
childish
intellect
and
who
could
show
alike
the
submissiveness
of
a
woman
and
the
courage
of
a
hero
on
the
evening
in
question
he
was
dressed
in
a
coat
and
trousers
of
greenish
corduroy
a
soft
felt
hat
placed
lightly
on
the
back
of
his
head
cast
a
streak
of
shadow
over
his
brow
as
the
neighbouring
clock
struck
the
half
hour
he
suddenly
started
from
his
reverie
perceiving
that
the
white
moonlight
was
shining
full
upon
him
he
gazed
anxiously
ahead
then
he
abruptly
dived
back
into
the
shade
but
was
unable
to
recover
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
he
now
realised
that
his
hands
and
feet
were
becoming
very
cold
and
impatience
seized
hold
of
him
so
he
jumped
upon
the
stone
again
and
once
more
glanced
over
the
which
was
still
empty
and
silent
finally
at
a
loss
how
to
employ
his
time
he
jumped
down
fetched
his
gun
from
the
pile
of
planks
where
he
had
concealed
it
and
amused
himself
by
working
the
trigger
the
weapon
was
a
long
heavy
carbine
which
had
doubtless
belonged
to
some
smuggler
the
thickness
of
the
butt
and
the
breech
of
the
barrel
showed
it
to
be
an
old
flintlock
which
had
been
altered
into
a
percussion
gun
by
some
local
gunsmith
such
firearms
are
to
be
found
in
farmhouses
hanging
against
the
wall
over
the
the
young
man
caressed
his
weapon
with
affection
twenty
times
or
more
he
pulled
the
trigger
thrust
his
little
finger
into
the
barrel
and
examined
the
butt
attentively
by
degrees
he
grew
full
of
youth
enthusiasm
combined
with
childish
frolicsomeness
and
ended
by
levelling
his
weapon
and
aiming
at
space
like
a
recruit
going
through
his
drill
it
was
now
very
nearly
eight
o
clock
and
he
had
been
holding
his
gun
levelled
for
over
a
minute
when
all
at
once
a
low
panting
call
light
as
a
breath
came
from
the
direction
of
the
are
you
there
silvere
the
voice
asked
silvere
dropped
his
gun
and
bounded
on
to
the
tombstone
yes
yes
he
replied
also
in
a
hushed
voice
wait
i
ll
help
before
he
could
stretch
out
his
arms
however
a
girl
s
head
appeared
above
the
wall
with
singular
agility
the
damsel
had
availed
herself
of
the
trunk
of
a
and
climbed
aloft
like
a
kitten
the
ease
and
certainty
with
which
she
moved
showed
that
she
was
familiar
with
this
strange
spot
in
another
moment
she
was
seated
on
the
coping
of
the
wall
then
silvere
taking
her
in
his
arms
carried
her
though
not
without
a
struggle
to
the
seat
let
go
she
laughingly
cried
let
go
i
can
get
down
alone
very
and
when
she
was
seated
on
the
stone
slab
she
added
have
you
been
waiting
for
me
long
i
ve
been
running
and
am
quite
out
of
silvere
made
no
reply
he
seemed
in
no
laughing
humour
but
gazed
sorrowfully
into
the
girl
s
face
i
wanted
to
see
you
miette
he
said
as
he
seated
himself
beside
her
i
should
have
waited
all
night
for
you
i
am
going
away
at
daybreak
miette
had
just
caught
sight
of
the
gun
lying
on
the
grass
and
with
a
thoughtful
air
she
murmured
ah
so
it
s
decided
then
there
s
your
gun
yes
replied
silvere
after
a
brief
pause
his
voice
still
faltering
it
s
my
gun
i
thought
it
best
to
remove
it
from
the
house
morning
aunt
dide
might
have
seen
me
take
it
and
have
felt
uneasy
about
it
i
am
going
to
hide
it
and
shall
fetch
it
just
before
then
as
miette
could
not
remove
her
eyes
from
the
weapon
which
he
had
so
foolishly
left
on
the
grass
he
jumped
up
and
again
hid
it
among
the
woodstacks
we
learnt
this
morning
he
said
as
he
resumed
his
seat
that
the
insurgents
of
la
palud
and
saint
were
on
the
march
and
spent
last
night
at
alboise
we
have
decided
to
join
them
some
of
the
workmen
of
plassans
have
already
left
the
town
this
afternoon
those
who
still
remain
will
join
their
brothers
he
spoke
the
word
brothers
with
youthful
emphasis
a
contest
is
becoming
inevitable
he
added
but
at
any
rate
we
have
right
on
our
side
and
we
shall
miette
listened
to
silvere
her
eyes
meantime
gazing
in
front
of
her
without
observing
anything
tis
well
she
said
when
he
had
finished
speaking
and
after
a
fresh
pause
she
continued
you
warned
me
yet
i
still
hoped
however
it
is
neither
of
them
knew
what
else
to
say
the
green
path
in
the
deserted
corner
of
the
relapsed
into
melancholy
stillness
only
the
moon
chased
the
shadows
of
the
piles
of
timber
over
the
grass
the
two
young
people
on
the
tombstone
remained
silent
and
motionless
in
the
pale
light
silvere
had
passed
his
arm
round
miette
s
waist
and
she
was
leaning
against
his
shoulder
they
exchanged
no
kisses
naught
but
an
embrace
in
which
love
showed
the
innocent
tenderness
of
fraternal
affection
miette
was
enveloped
in
a
long
brown
hooded
cloak
reaching
to
her
feet
and
leaving
only
her
head
and
hands
visible
the
women
of
the
lower
classes
in
provence
the
peasantry
and
workpeople
still
wear
these
ample
cloaks
which
are
called
pelisses
it
is
a
fashion
which
must
have
lasted
for
ages
miette
had
thrown
back
her
hood
on
arriving
living
in
the
open
air
and
born
of
a
hotblooded
race
she
never
wore
a
cap
her
bare
head
showed
in
bold
relief
against
the
wall
which
the
moonlight
whitened
she
was
still
a
child
no
doubt
but
a
child
ripening
into
womanhood
she
had
reached
that
adorable
uncertain
hour
when
the
frolicsome
girl
changes
to
a
young
woman
at
that
stage
of
life
a
delicacy
a
hesitancy
of
contour
that
is
exquisitely
charming
distinguishes
young
girls
the
outlines
of
womanhood
appear
amidst
girlhood
s
innocent
slimness
and
woman
shoots
forth
at
first
all
embarrassment
still
retaining
much
of
the
child
and
ever
and
unconsciously
betraying
her
sex
this
period
is
very
unpropitious
for
some
girls
who
suddenly
shoot
up
become
ugly
sallow
and
frail
like
plants
before
their
due
season
for
those
however
who
like
miette
are
healthy
and
live
in
the
open
air
it
is
a
time
of
delightful
gracefulness
which
once
passed
can
never
be
recalled
miette
was
thirteen
years
of
age
and
although
strong
and
sturdy
did
not
look
any
older
so
bright
and
childish
was
the
smile
which
lit
up
her
countenance
however
she
was
nearly
as
tall
as
silvere
plump
and
full
of
life
like
her
lover
she
had
no
common
beauty
she
would
not
have
been
considered
ugly
but
she
might
have
appeared
peculiar
to
many
young
exquisites
her
rich
black
hair
rose
roughly
erect
above
her
forehead
streamed
back
like
a
rushing
wave
and
flowed
over
her
head
and
neck
like
an
inky
sea
tossing
and
bubbling
capriciously
it
was
very
thick
and
inconvenient
to
arrange
however
she
twisted
it
as
tightly
as
possible
into
coils
as
thick
as
a
child
s
fist
which
she
wound
together
at
the
back
of
her
head
she
had
little
time
to
devote
to
her
toilette
but
this
huge
chignon
hastily
contrived
without
the
aid
of
any
mirror
was
often
instinct
with
vigorous
grace
on
seeing
her
thus
naturally
helmeted
with
a
mass
of
frizzy
hair
which
hung
about
her
neck
and
temples
like
a
mane
one
could
readily
understand
why
she
always
went
bareheaded
heedless
alike
of
rain
and
frost
under
her
dark
locks
appeared
her
low
forehead
curved
and
golden
like
a
crescent
moon
her
large
prominent
eyes
her
short
nose
with
dilated
nostrils
and
her
thick
ruddy
lips
when
regarded
apart
from
one
another
would
have
looked
ugly
viewed
however
all
together
amidst
the
delightful
roundness
and
vivacious
mobility
of
her
countenance
they
formed
an
ensemble
of
strange
surprising
beauty
when
miette
laughed
throwing
back
her
head
and
gently
resting
it
on
her
right
shoulder
she
resembled
an
bacchante
her
throat
distending
with
sonorous
gaiety
her
cheeks
round
like
those
of
a
child
her
teeth
large
and
white
her
twists
of
woolly
hair
tossed
by
every
outburst
of
merriment
and
waving
like
a
crown
of
vine
leaves
to
realise
that
she
was
only
a
child
of
thirteen
one
had
to
notice
the
innocence
underlying
her
full
womanly
laughter
and
especially
the
delicacy
of
her
chin
and
soft
transparency
of
her
temples
in
certain
lights
miette
s
face
showed
yellow
like
amber
a
little
soft
black
down
already
shaded
her
upper
lip
toil
too
was
beginning
to
disfigure
her
small
hands
which
if
left
idle
would
have
become
charmingly
plump
and
delicate
miette
and
silvere
long
remained
silent
they
were
reading
their
own
anxious
thoughts
and
as
they
pondered
upon
the
unknown
terrors
of
the
morrow
they
tightened
their
mutual
embrace
their
hearts
communed
with
each
other
they
understood
how
useless
and
cruel
would
be
any
verbal
plaint
the
girl
however
could
at
last
no
longer
contain
herself
and
choking
with
emotion
she
gave
expression
in
one
phrase
to
their
mutual
misgivings
you
will
come
back
again
won
t
you
she
whispered
as
she
hung
on
silvere
s
neck
silvere
made
no
reply
but
and
fearing
lest
he
should
give
way
to
tears
like
herself
he
kissed
her
in
brotherly
fashion
on
the
cheek
at
a
loss
for
any
other
consolation
then
disengaging
themselves
they
again
lapsed
into
silence
after
a
moment
miette
shuddered
now
that
she
no
longer
leant
against
silvere
s
shoulder
she
was
becoming
icy
cold
yet
she
would
not
have
shuddered
thus
had
she
been
in
this
deserted
path
the
previous
evening
seated
on
this
tombstone
where
for
several
seasons
they
had
tasted
so
much
happiness
i
m
very
cold
she
said
as
she
pulled
her
hood
over
her
head
shall
we
walk
about
a
little
the
young
man
asked
her
it
s
not
yet
nine
o
clock
we
can
take
a
stroll
along
the
miette
reflected
that
for
a
long
time
she
would
probably
not
have
the
pleasure
of
another
meeting
another
of
those
evening
chats
the
joy
of
which
served
to
sustain
her
all
day
long
yes
let
us
walk
a
little
she
eagerly
replied
let
us
go
as
far
as
the
mill
i
could
pass
the
whole
night
like
this
if
you
wanted
they
rose
from
the
tombstone
and
were
soon
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
a
pile
of
planks
here
miette
opened
her
cloak
which
had
a
quilted
lining
of
red
twill
and
threw
half
of
it
over
silvere
s
shoulders
thus
enveloping
him
as
he
stood
there
close
beside
her
the
same
garment
cloaked
them
both
and
they
passed
their
arms
round
each
other
s
waist
and
became
as
it
were
but
one
being
when
they
were
thus
shrouded
in
the
pelisse
they
walked
slowly
towards
the
high
road
fearlessly
crossing
the
vacant
parts
of
the
which
looked
white
in
the
moonlight
miette
had
thrown
the
cloak
over
silvere
and
he
had
submitted
to
it
quite
naturally
as
though
indeed
the
garment
rendered
them
a
similar
service
every
evening
the
road
to
nice
on
either
side
of
which
the
suburban
houses
are
built
was
in
the
year
lined
with
ancient
grand
and
gigantic
ruins
still
full
of
vigour
which
the
fastidious
town
council
has
replaced
some
years
since
by
some
little
when
silvere
and
miette
found
themselves
under
the
elms
the
huge
boughs
of
which
cast
shadows
on
the
moonlit
footpath
they
met
now
and
again
black
forms
which
silently
skirted
the
house
fronts
these
too
were
amorous
couples
closely
wrapped
in
one
and
the
same
cloak
and
strolling
in
the
darkness
this
style
of
promenading
has
been
instituted
by
the
young
lovers
of
southern
towns
those
boys
and
girls
among
the
people
who
mean
to
marry
sooner
or
later
but
who
do
not
dislike
a
kiss
or
two
in
advance
know
no
spot
where
they
can
kiss
at
their
ease
without
exposing
themselves
to
recognition
and
gossip
accordingly
while
strolling
about
the
suburbs
the
plots
of
waste
land
the
footpaths
of
the
high
road
in
fact
all
these
places
where
there
are
few
and
numerous
shady
nooks
they
conceal
their
identity
by
wrapping
themselves
in
these
long
cloaks
which
are
capacious
enough
to
cover
a
whole
family
the
parents
tolerate
these
proceedings
however
stiff
may
be
provincial
propriety
no
apprehensions
seemingly
are
entertained
and
on
the
other
hand
nothing
could
be
more
charming
than
these
lovers
rambles
which
appeal
so
keenly
to
the
southerner
s
fanciful
imagination
there
is
a
veritable
masquerade
fertile
in
innocent
enjoyments
within
the
reach
of
the
most
humble
the
girl
clasps
her
sweetheart
to
her
bosom
enveloping
him
in
her
own
warm
cloak
and
no
doubt
it
is
delightful
to
be
able
to
kiss
one
s
sweetheart
within
those
shrouding
folds
without
danger
of
being
recognised
one
couple
is
exactly
like
another
and
to
the
belated
pedestrian
who
sees
the
vague
groups
gliding
hither
and
thither
tis
merely
love
passing
love
guessed
and
scarce
espied
the
lovers
know
they
are
safely
concealed
within
their
cloaks
they
converse
in
undertones
and
make
themselves
quite
at
home
most
frequently
they
do
not
converse
at
all
but
walk
along
at
random
and
in
silence
content
in
their
embrace
the
climate
alone
is
to
blame
for
having
in
the
first
instance
prompted
these
young
lovers
to
retire
to
secluded
spots
in
the
suburbs
on
fine
summer
nights
one
can
not
walk
round
plassans
without
coming
across
a
hooded
couple
in
every
patch
of
shadow
falling
from
the
house
walls
certain
places
the
aire
for
instance
are
full
of
these
dark
dominoes
brushing
past
one
another
gliding
softly
in
the
warm
nocturnal
air
one
might
imagine
they
were
guests
invited
to
some
mysterious
ball
given
by
the
stars
to
lowly
lovers
when
the
weather
is
very
warm
and
the
girls
do
not
wear
cloaks
they
simply
turn
up
their
and
in
the
winter
the
more
passionate
lovers
make
light
of
the
frosts
thus
miette
and
silvere
as
they
descended
the
nice
road
thought
little
of
the
chill
december
night
they
passed
through
the
slumbering
suburb
without
exchanging
a
word
but
enjoying
the
mute
delight
of
their
warm
embrace
their
hearts
were
heavy
the
joy
which
they
felt
in
being
side
by
side
was
tinged
with
the
painful
emotion
which
comes
from
the
thought
of
approaching
severance
and
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
could
never
exhaust
the
mingled
sweetness
and
bitterness
of
the
silence
which
slowly
lulled
their
steps
but
the
houses
soon
grew
fewer
and
they
reached
the
end
of
the
faubourg
there
stands
the
entrance
to
the
an
iron
gate
fixed
to
two
strong
pillars
a
low
row
of
being
visible
through
the
bars
silvere
and
miette
instinctively
cast
a
glance
inside
as
they
passed
on
beyond
the
the
road
descends
with
a
gentle
slope
to
a
valley
which
serves
as
the
bed
of
a
little
rivulet
the
viorne
a
brook
in
summer
but
a
torrent
in
winter
the
rows
of
elms
still
extended
the
whole
way
at
that
time
making
the
high
road
a
magnificent
avenue
which
cast
a
broad
band
of
gigantic
trees
across
the
hill
which
was
planted
with
corn
and
stunted
vines
on
that
december
night
under
the
clear
cold
moonlight
the
fields
stretching
away
on
either
hand
resembled
vast
beds
of
greyish
wadding
which
deadened
every
sound
in
the
atmosphere
the
dull
murmur
of
the
viorne
in
the
distance
alone
sent
a
quivering
thrill
through
the
profound
silence
of
the
when
the
young
people
had
begun
to
descend
the
avenue
miette
s
thoughts
reverted
to
the
which
they
had
just
left
behind
them
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
away
this
evening
she
said
my
uncle
wouldn
t
let
me
go
he
had
shut
himself
up
in
a
cellar
where
he
was
hiding
his
money
i
think
for
he
seemed
greatly
frightened
this
morning
at
the
events
that
are
taking
silvere
clasped
her
yet
more
lovingly
be
brave
said
he
the
time
will
come
when
we
shall
be
able
to
see
each
other
freely
the
whole
day
long
you
must
not
oh
replied
the
girl
shaking
her
head
you
are
very
hopeful
for
my
part
i
sometimes
feel
very
sad
it
isn
t
the
hard
work
which
grieves
me
on
the
contrary
i
am
often
very
glad
of
my
uncle
s
severity
and
the
tasks
he
sets
me
he
was
quite
right
to
make
me
a
peasant
girl
i
should
perhaps
have
turned
out
badly
for
do
you
know
silvere
there
are
moments
when
i
fancy
myself
under
a
curse
i
feel
then
that
i
should
like
to
be
dead
i
think
of
you
know
as
she
spoke
these
last
words
her
voice
broke
into
a
sob
silvere
interrupted
her
somewhat
harshly
be
quiet
he
said
you
promised
not
to
think
about
it
it
s
no
crime
of
yours
we
love
each
other
very
much
don
t
we
he
added
in
a
gentler
tone
when
we
re
married
you
ll
have
no
more
unpleasant
i
know
murmured
miette
you
are
so
kind
you
sustain
me
but
what
am
i
to
do
i
sometimes
have
fears
and
feelings
of
revolt
i
think
at
times
that
i
have
been
wronged
and
then
i
should
like
to
do
something
wicked
you
see
i
pour
forth
my
heart
to
you
whenever
my
father
s
name
is
thrown
in
my
face
i
feel
my
whole
body
burning
when
the
urchins
cry
at
me
as
i
pass
eh
la
chantegreil
i
lose
all
control
of
myself
and
feel
that
i
should
like
to
lay
hold
of
them
and
whip
after
a
savage
pause
she
resumed
as
for
you
you
re
a
man
you
re
going
to
fight
you
re
very
silvere
had
let
her
speak
on
after
a
few
steps
he
observed
sorrowfully
you
are
wrong
miette
yours
is
bad
anger
you
shouldn
t
rebel
against
justice
as
for
me
i
m
going
to
fight
in
defence
of
our
common
rights
not
to
gratify
any
personal
all
the
same
the
young
girl
continued
i
should
like
to
be
a
man
and
handle
a
gun
i
feel
that
it
would
do
me
then
as
silvere
remained
silent
she
perceived
that
she
had
displeased
him
her
feverishness
subsided
and
she
whispered
in
a
supplicating
tone
you
are
not
angry
with
me
are
you
it
s
your
departure
which
grieves
me
and
awakens
such
ideas
i
know
very
well
you
are
right
that
i
ought
to
be
then
she
began
to
cry
and
silvere
moved
by
her
tears
grasped
her
hands
and
kissed
them
see
now
how
you
pass
from
anger
to
tears
like
a
child
he
said
lovingly
you
must
be
reasonable
i
m
not
scolding
you
i
only
want
to
see
you
happier
and
that
depends
largely
upon
the
remembrance
of
the
drama
which
miette
had
so
sadly
evoked
cast
a
temporary
gloom
over
the
lovers
they
continued
their
walk
with
bowed
heads
and
troubled
thoughts
do
you
think
i
m
much
happier
than
you
silvere
at
last
inquired
resuming
the
conversation
in
spite
of
himself
if
my
grandmother
had
not
taken
care
of
me
and
educated
me
what
would
have
become
of
me
with
the
exception
of
my
uncle
antoine
who
is
an
artisan
like
myself
and
who
taught
me
to
love
the
republic
all
my
other
relations
seem
to
fear
that
i
might
besmirch
them
by
coming
near
he
was
now
speaking
with
animation
and
suddenly
stopped
detaining
miette
in
the
middle
of
the
road
god
is
my
witness
he
continued
that
i
do
not
envy
or
hate
anybody
but
if
we
triumph
i
shall
have
to
tell
the
truth
to
those
fine
gentlemen
uncle
antoine
knows
all
about
this
matter
you
ll
see
when
we
return
we
shall
all
live
free
and
then
miette
gently
led
him
on
and
they
resumed
their
walk
you
dearly
love
your
republic
the
girl
asked
essaying
a
joke
do
you
love
me
as
much
her
smile
was
not
altogether
free
from
a
tinge
of
bitterness
she
was
thinking
perhaps
how
easily
silvere
abandoned
her
to
go
and
scour
the
but
the
lad
gravely
replied
you
are
my
wife
to
whom
i
have
given
my
whole
heart
i
love
the
republic
because
i
love
you
when
we
are
married
we
shall
want
plenty
of
happiness
and
it
is
to
procure
a
share
of
that
happiness
that
i
m
going
way
morning
you
surely
don
t
want
to
persuade
me
to
remain
at
home
oh
no
cried
the
girl
eagerly
a
man
should
be
brave
courage
is
beautiful
you
must
forgive
my
jealousy
i
should
like
to
be
as
as
you
are
you
would
love
me
all
the
more
wouldn
t
you
after
a
moment
s
silence
she
added
with
charming
vivacity
and
ingenuousness
ah
how
willingly
i
shall
kiss
you
when
you
come
back
this
outburst
of
a
loving
and
courageous
heart
deeply
affected
silvere
he
clasped
miette
in
his
arms
and
printed
several
kisses
on
her
cheek
as
she
laughingly
struggled
to
escape
him
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
of
emotion
all
around
the
lovers
the
country
still
slumbered
amid
the
deep
stillness
of
the
cold
they
were
now
down
the
hill
on
the
top
of
a
rather
lofty
hillock
to
the
left
stood
the
ruins
of
a
windmill
blanched
by
the
moon
the
tower
which
had
fallen
in
on
one
side
alone
remained
this
was
the
limit
which
the
young
people
had
assigned
to
their
walk
they
had
come
straight
from
the
faubourg
without
casting
a
single
glance
at
the
fields
between
which
they
passed
when
silvere
had
kissed
miette
s
cheek
he
raised
his
head
and
observed
the
mill
what
a
long
walk
we
ve
had
he
exclaimed
see
here
is
the
mill
it
must
be
nearly
nine
we
must
go
but
miette
pouted
let
us
walk
a
little
further
she
implored
only
a
few
steps
just
as
far
as
the
little
no
farther
silvere
smiled
as
he
again
took
her
round
the
waist
then
they
continued
to
descend
the
hill
no
longer
fearing
inquisitive
glances
for
they
had
not
met
a
living
soul
since
passing
the
last
houses
they
nevertheless
remained
enveloped
in
the
long
pelisse
which
seemed
as
it
were
a
natural
nest
for
their
love
it
had
shrouded
them
on
so
many
happy
evenings
had
they
simply
walked
side
by
side
they
would
have
felt
small
and
isolated
in
that
vast
stretch
of
country
whereas
blended
together
as
they
were
they
became
bolder
and
seemed
less
puny
between
the
folds
of
the
pelisse
they
gazed
upon
the
fields
stretching
on
both
sides
of
the
road
without
experiencing
that
crushing
feeling
with
which
callous
vistas
oppress
the
human
affections
it
seemed
to
them
as
though
they
had
brought
their
house
with
them
they
felt
a
pleasure
in
viewing
the
as
from
a
window
delighting
in
the
calm
solitude
the
sheets
of
slumbering
light
the
glimpses
of
nature
vaguely
distinguishable
beneath
the
shroud
of
night
and
winter
the
whole
of
that
valley
indeed
which
while
charming
them
could
not
thrust
itself
between
their
hearts
all
continuity
of
conversation
had
ceased
they
spoke
no
more
of
others
nor
even
of
themselves
they
were
absorbed
by
the
present
pressing
each
other
s
hands
uttering
exclamations
at
the
sight
of
some
particular
spot
exchanging
words
at
rare
intervals
and
then
understanding
each
other
but
little
for
drowsiness
came
from
the
warmth
of
their
embrace
silvere
forgot
his
republican
enthusiasm
miette
no
longer
reflected
that
her
lover
would
be
leaving
her
in
an
hour
for
a
long
time
perhaps
for
ever
the
transports
of
their
affection
lulled
them
into
a
feeling
of
security
as
on
other
days
when
no
prospect
of
parting
had
marred
the
tranquility
of
their
meetings
they
still
walked
on
and
soon
reached
the
little
crossroad
mentioned
by
miette
a
bit
of
a
lane
which
led
through
the
fields
to
a
village
on
the
banks
of
the
viorne
but
they
passed
on
pretending
not
to
notice
this
path
where
they
had
agreed
to
stop
and
it
was
only
some
minutes
afterwards
that
silvere
whispered
it
must
be
very
late
you
will
get
no
i
assure
you
i
m
not
at
all
tired
the
girl
replied
i
could
walk
several
leagues
like
this
then
in
a
coaxing
tone
she
added
let
us
go
down
as
far
as
the
meadows
of
there
we
will
really
stop
and
turn
silvere
whom
the
girl
s
rhythmic
gait
lulled
to
made
no
objection
and
their
rapture
began
afresh
they
now
went
on
more
slowly
fearing
the
moment
when
they
would
have
to
retrace
their
steps
so
long
as
they
walked
onward
they
felt
as
though
they
were
advancing
to
the
eternity
of
their
mutual
embrace
the
return
would
mean
separation
and
bitter
the
declivity
of
the
road
was
gradually
becoming
more
gentle
in
the
valley
below
there
are
meadows
extending
as
far
as
the
viorne
which
runs
at
the
other
end
beneath
a
range
of
low
hills
these
meadows
separated
from
the
by
thickset
hedges
are
the
meadows
of
bah
exclaimed
silvere
this
time
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
first
patches
of
grass
we
may
as
well
go
as
far
as
the
at
this
miette
burst
out
laughing
clasped
the
young
man
round
the
neck
and
kissed
him
noisily
at
the
spot
where
the
hedges
begin
there
were
in
those
days
two
elms
forming
the
end
of
the
long
avenue
two
colossal
trees
larger
than
any
of
the
others
the
treeless
fields
stretch
out
from
the
high
road
like
a
broad
band
of
green
wool
as
far
as
the
willows
and
birches
by
the
river
the
distance
from
the
last
elms
to
the
bridge
is
scarcely
three
hundred
yards
the
lovers
took
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
to
cover
that
space
at
last
however
slow
their
gait
they
reached
the
bridge
and
there
they
stopped
the
road
to
nice
ran
up
in
front
of
them
along
the
opposite
slope
of
the
valley
but
they
could
only
see
a
small
portion
of
it
as
it
takes
a
sudden
turn
about
half
a
mile
from
the
bridge
and
is
lost
to
view
among
the
wooded
hills
on
looking
round
they
caught
sight
of
the
other
end
of
the
road
that
which
they
had
just
traversed
and
which
leads
in
a
direct
line
from
plassans
to
the
viorne
in
the
beautiful
winter
moonlight
it
looked
like
a
long
silver
ribbon
with
dark
edgings
traced
by
the
rows
of
elms
on
the
right
and
left
the
ploughed
showed
like
vast
grey
vague
seas
intersected
by
this
ribbon
this
roadway
white
with
frost
and
brilliant
as
with
metallic
lustre
up
above
on
a
level
with
the
horizon
lights
shone
from
a
few
windows
in
the
faubourg
resembling
glowing
sparks
by
degrees
miette
and
silvere
had
walked
fully
a
league
they
gazed
at
the
intervening
road
full
of
silent
admiration
for
the
vast
amphitheatre
which
rose
to
the
verge
of
the
heavens
and
over
which
flowed
bluish
streams
of
light
as
over
the
superposed
rocks
of
a
gigantic
waterfall
the
strange
and
colossal
picture
spread
out
amid
deathlike
stillness
and
silence
nothing
could
have
been
of
more
sovereign
grandeur
then
the
young
people
having
leant
against
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
gazed
beneath
them
the
viorne
swollen
by
the
rains
flowed
on
with
a
dull
continuous
sound
up
and
down
stream
despite
the
darkness
which
filled
the
hollows
they
perceived
the
black
lines
of
the
trees
growing
on
the
banks
here
and
there
glided
the
moonbeams
casting
a
trail
of
molten
metal
as
it
were
over
the
water
which
glittered
and
danced
like
rays
of
light
on
the
scales
of
some
live
animal
the
gleams
darted
with
a
mysterious
charm
along
the
gray
torrent
betwixt
the
vague
foliage
you
might
have
thought
this
an
enchanted
valley
some
wondrous
retreat
where
a
community
of
shadows
and
gleams
lived
a
fantastic
life
this
part
of
the
river
was
familiar
to
the
lovers
they
had
often
come
here
in
search
of
coolness
on
warm
july
nights
they
had
spent
hours
hidden
among
the
clusters
of
willows
on
the
right
bank
at
the
spot
where
the
meadows
of
spread
their
verdant
carpet
to
the
waterside
they
remembered
every
bend
of
the
bank
the
stones
on
which
they
had
stepped
in
order
to
cross
the
viorne
at
that
season
as
narrow
as
a
brooklet
and
certain
little
grassy
hollows
where
they
had
indulged
in
their
dreams
of
love
miette
therefore
now
gazed
from
the
bridge
at
the
right
bank
of
the
torrent
with
longing
eyes
if
it
were
warmer
she
sighed
we
might
go
down
and
rest
awhile
before
going
back
up
the
then
after
a
pause
during
which
she
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
banks
she
resumed
look
down
there
silvere
at
that
black
mass
yonder
in
front
of
the
lock
do
you
remember
that
s
the
brushwood
where
we
sat
last
corpus
christi
yes
so
it
is
replied
silvere
softly
this
was
the
spot
where
they
had
first
ventured
to
kiss
each
other
on
the
cheek
the
remembrance
just
roused
by
the
girl
s
words
brought
both
of
them
a
delightful
feeling
an
emotion
in
which
the
joys
of
the
past
mingled
with
the
hopes
of
the
morrow
before
their
eyes
with
the
rapidity
of
lightening
there
passed
all
the
delightful
evenings
they
had
spent
together
especially
that
evening
of
corpus
christi
day
with
the
warm
sky
the
cool
willows
of
the
viorne
and
their
own
loving
talk
and
at
the
same
time
whilst
the
past
came
back
to
their
hearts
full
of
a
delightful
savour
they
fancied
they
could
plunge
into
the
unknown
future
see
their
dreams
realised
and
march
through
life
arm
in
arm
even
as
they
had
just
been
doing
on
the
highway
warmly
wrapped
in
the
same
cloak
then
rapture
came
to
them
again
and
they
smiled
in
each
other
s
eyes
alone
amidst
all
the
silent
radiance
suddenly
however
silvere
raised
his
head
and
throwing
off
the
cloak
listened
attentively
miette
in
her
surprise
imitated
him
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
he
had
started
so
abruptly
from
her
side
confused
sounds
had
for
a
moment
been
coming
from
behind
the
hills
in
the
midst
of
which
the
nice
road
wends
its
way
they
suggested
the
distant
jolting
of
a
procession
of
carts
but
not
distinctly
so
loud
was
the
roaring
of
the
viorne
gradually
however
they
became
more
pronounced
and
rose
at
last
like
the
tramping
of
an
army
on
the
march
then
amidst
the
continuous
growing
rumble
one
detected
the
shouts
of
a
crowd
strange
rhythmical
blasts
as
of
a
hurricane
one
could
even
have
fancied
they
were
the
thunderclaps
of
a
rapidly
approaching
storm
which
was
already
disturbing
the
slumbering
atmosphere
silvere
listened
attentively
unable
to
tell
however
what
were
those
shouts
for
the
hills
prevented
them
from
reaching
him
distinctly
suddenly
a
dark
mass
appeared
at
the
turn
of
the
road
and
then
the
marseillaise
burst
forth
formidable
sung
as
with
avenging
fury
ah
here
they
are
cried
silvere
with
a
burst
of
joyous
enthusiasm
forthwith
he
began
to
run
up
the
hill
dragging
miette
with
him
on
the
left
of
the
road
was
an
embankment
planted
with
evergreen
oaks
up
which
he
clambered
with
the
young
girl
to
avoid
being
carried
away
by
the
surging
howling
multitude
when
he
had
reached
the
top
of
the
bank
and
the
shadow
of
the
brushwood
miette
rather
pale
gazed
sorrowfully
at
those
men
whose
distant
song
had
sufficed
to
draw
silvere
from
her
embrace
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
band
had
thrust
itself
between
them
they
had
been
so
happy
a
few
minutes
before
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
alone
and
lost
amidst
the
overwhelming
silence
and
discreet
glimmer
of
the
moon
and
now
silvere
whose
head
was
turned
away
from
her
who
no
longer
seemed
even
conscious
of
her
presence
had
eyes
only
for
those
strangers
whom
he
called
his
brothers
the
band
descended
the
slope
with
a
superb
irresistible
stride
there
could
have
been
nothing
grander
than
the
irruption
of
those
few
thousand
men
into
that
cold
still
deathly
scene
the
highway
became
a
torrent
rolling
with
living
waves
which
seemed
inexhaustible
at
the
bend
in
the
road
fresh
masses
ever
appeared
whose
songs
ever
helped
to
swell
the
roar
of
this
human
tempest
when
the
last
battalions
came
in
sight
the
uproar
was
deafening
the
marseillaise
filled
the
atmosphere
as
if
blown
through
enormous
trumpets
by
giant
mouths
which
cast
it
vibrating
with
a
brazen
clang
into
every
corner
of
the
valley
the
slumbering
awoke
with
a
start
quivering
like
a
beaten
drum
resonant
to
its
very
entrails
and
repeating
with
each
and
every
echo
the
passionate
notes
of
the
national
song
and
then
the
singing
was
no
longer
confined
to
the
men
from
the
very
horizon
from
the
distant
rocks
the
ploughed
land
the
meadows
the
copses
the
smallest
bits
of
brushwood
human
voices
seemed
to
come
the
great
amphitheatre
extending
from
the
river
to
plassans
the
gigantic
cascade
over
which
the
bluish
moonlight
flowed
was
as
if
filled
with
innumerable
invisible
people
cheering
the
insurgents
and
in
the
depths
of
the
viorne
along
the
waters
streaked
with
mysterious
metallic
reflections
there
was
not
a
dark
nook
but
seemed
to
conceal
human
beings
who
took
up
each
refrain
with
yet
greater
passion
with
air
and
earth
alike
quivering
the
whole
cried
for
vengeance
and
liberty
so
long
as
the
little
army
was
descending
the
slope
the
roar
of
the
populace
thus
rolled
on
in
sonorous
waves
broken
by
abrupt
outbursts
which
shook
the
very
stones
in
the
roadway
silvere
pale
with
emotion
still
listened
and
looked
on
the
insurgents
who
led
the
van
of
that
swarming
roaring
stream
so
vague
and
monstrous
in
the
darkness
were
rapidly
approaching
the
bridge
i
thought
murmured
miette
that
you
would
not
pass
through
plassans
they
must
have
altered
the
plan
of
operations
silvere
replied
we
were
in
fact
to
have
marched
to
the
chief
town
by
the
toulon
road
passing
to
the
left
of
plassans
and
orcheres
they
must
have
left
alboise
this
afternoon
and
passed
les
tulettes
this
the
head
of
the
column
had
already
arrived
in
front
of
the
young
people
the
little
army
was
more
orderly
than
one
would
have
expected
from
a
band
of
undisciplined
men
the
contingents
from
the
various
towns
and
villages
formed
separate
battalions
each
separated
by
a
distance
of
a
few
paces
these
battalions
were
apparently
under
the
orders
of
certain
chiefs
for
the
nonce
the
pace
at
which
they
were
descending
the
hillside
made
them
a
compact
mass
of
invincible
strength
there
were
probably
about
three
thousand
men
all
united
and
carried
away
by
the
same
storm
of
indignation
the
strange
details
of
the
scene
were
not
discernible
amidst
the
shadows
cast
over
the
highway
by
the
lofty
slopes
at
five
or
six
feet
from
the
brushwood
however
where
miette
and
silvere
were
sheltered
the
embankment
gave
place
to
a
little
pathway
which
ran
alongside
the
viorne
and
the
moonlight
flowing
through
this
gap
cast
a
broad
band
of
radiance
across
the
road
when
the
first
insurgents
reached
this
patch
of
light
they
were
suddenly
illumined
by
a
sharp
white
glow
which
revealed
with
singular
distinctness
every
outline
of
visage
or
costume
and
as
the
various
contingents
swept
on
the
young
people
thus
saw
them
emerge
fiercely
and
without
cessation
from
the
surrounding
darkness
as
the
first
men
passed
through
the
light
miette
instinctively
clung
to
silvere
although
she
knew
she
was
safe
even
from
observation
she
passed
her
arm
round
the
young
fellow
s
neck
resting
her
head
against
his
shoulder
and
with
the
hood
of
her
pelisse
encircling
her
pale
face
she
gazed
fixedly
at
that
square
patch
of
light
as
it
was
rapidly
traversed
by
those
strange
faces
transfigured
by
enthusiasm
with
dark
open
mouths
full
of
the
furious
cry
of
the
silvere
whom
she
felt
quivering
at
her
side
then
bent
towards
her
and
named
the
various
contingents
as
they
passed
the
column
marched
along
eight
abreast
in
the
van
were
a
number
of
big
fellows
who
seemed
to
possess
the
herculean
strength
and
naïve
confidence
of
giants
they
would
doubtless
prove
blind
intrepid
defenders
of
the
republic
on
their
shoulders
they
carried
large
axes
whose
edges
freshly
sharpened
glittered
in
the
moonlight
those
are
the
woodcutters
of
the
forests
of
the
seille
said
silvere
they
have
been
formed
into
a
corps
of
sappers
at
a
signal
from
their
leaders
they
would
march
as
far
as
paris
battering
down
the
gates
of
the
towns
with
their
axes
just
as
they
cut
down
the
old
on
the
the
young
man
spoke
with
pride
of
the
heavy
fists
of
his
brethren
and
on
seeing
a
band
of
labourers
and
men
tanned
by
the
sun
coming
along
behind
the
woodcutters
he
continued
that
is
the
contingent
from
la
palud
that
was
the
first
place
to
rise
the
men
in
blouses
are
labourers
who
cut
up
the
the
others
in
velveteen
jackets
must
be
sportsmen
poachers
and
living
in
the
passes
of
the
seille
the
poachers
knew
your
father
miette
they
have
good
firearms
which
they
handle
skilfully
ah
if
all
were
armed
in
the
same
manner
we
are
short
of
muskets
see
the
labourers
have
only
got
cudgels
miette
still
speechless
looked
on
and
listened
as
silvere
spoke
to
her
of
her
father
the
blood
surged
to
her
cheeks
her
face
burnt
as
she
scrutinised
the
sportsmen
with
a
strange
air
of
mingled
indignation
and
sympathy
from
this
moment
she
grew
animated
yielding
to
the
feverish
quiver
which
the
insurgents
songs
awakened
the
column
which
had
just
begun
the
marseillaise
afresh
was
still
marching
down
as
though
lashed
on
by
the
sharp
blasts
of
the
the
men
of
la
palud
were
followed
by
another
troop
of
workmen
among
whom
a
goodly
number
of
middle
class
folks
in
were
to
be
seen
those
are
the
men
of
silvere
resumed
that
rose
almost
at
the
same
time
as
la
palud
the
masters
joined
the
workmen
there
are
some
rich
men
there
miette
men
whose
wealth
would
enable
them
to
live
peacefully
at
home
but
who
prefer
to
risk
their
lives
in
defence
of
liberty
one
can
but
admire
them
weapons
are
very
scarce
however
they
ve
scarcely
got
a
few
but
do
you
see
those
men
yonder
miette
with
red
bands
round
their
left
elbows
they
are
the
the
contingents
descended
the
hill
more
rapidly
than
silvere
could
speak
while
he
was
naming
the
men
from
two
battalions
had
already
crossed
the
ray
of
light
which
blanched
the
roadway
did
you
see
the
insurgents
from
alboise
and
les
tulettes
pass
by
just
now
he
asked
i
recognised
burgat
the
blacksmith
they
must
have
joined
the
band
how
they
do
run
miette
was
now
leaning
forward
in
order
to
see
more
of
the
little
bands
described
to
her
by
the
young
man
the
quiver
she
felt
rose
from
her
bosom
to
her
throat
then
a
battalion
larger
and
better
disciplined
than
the
others
appeared
the
insurgents
composing
it
were
nearly
all
dressed
in
blue
blouses
with
red
sashes
round
their
waists
one
would
have
thought
they
were
arrayed
in
uniform
a
man
on
horseback
with
a
sabre
at
his
side
was
in
the
midst
of
them
and
most
of
these
improvised
soldiers
carried
guns
probably
carbines
and
old
muskets
of
the
national
guard
i
don
t
know
those
said
silvere
the
man
on
horseback
must
be
the
chief
i
ve
heard
spoken
of
he
brought
with
him
the
contingents
from
faverolles
and
the
neighbouring
villages
the
whole
column
ought
to
be
equipped
in
the
same
he
had
no
time
to
take
breath
ah
see
here
are
the
country
people
he
suddenly
cried
small
groups
of
ten
or
twenty
men
at
the
most
were
now
advancing
behind
the
men
of
faverolles
they
all
wore
the
short
jacket
of
the
southern
peasantry
and
as
they
sang
they
brandished
pitchforks
and
scythes
some
of
them
even
only
carried
large
navvies
shovels
every
hamlet
however
had
sent
its
men
silvere
who
recognised
the
parties
by
their
leaders
enumerated
them
in
feverish
tones
the
contingent
from
chavanoz

there
are
only
eight
men

they

heard
about
him
he
s
a
staunch
he
was
becoming
intoxicated
with
the
spectacle
now
that
each
battalion
consisted
of
only
a
few
insurgents
he
had
to
name
them
yet
more
hastily
and
his
precipitancy
gave
him
the
appearance
of
one
in
a
frenzy
ah
miette
he
continued
what
a
fine
march
past
rozan
vernoux
corbiere
and
there
are
more
still
you

see
these

those

still
more

the

passing

murdaran
his
voice
was
husky
with
emotion
as
he
finished
naming
these
men
who
seemed
to
be
borne
away
by
a
whirlwind
as
fast
as
he
enumerated
them
erect
with
glowing
countenance
he
pointed
out
the
several
contingents
with
a
nervous
gesture
miette
followed
his
movements
the
road
below
attracted
her
like
the
depths
of
a
precipice
to
avoid
slipping
down
the
incline
she
clung
to
the
young
man
s
neck
a
strange
intoxication
emanated
from
those
men
who
themselves
were
inebriated
with
clamour
courage
and
confidence
those
beings
seen
athwart
a
moonbeam
those
youths
and
those
men
in
their
prime
those
old
people
brandishing
strange
weapons
and
dressed
in
the
most
diverse
costumes
from
working
smock
to
middle
class
overcoat
those
endless
rows
of
heads
which
the
hour
and
the
circumstances
endowed
with
an
expression
of
fanatical
energy
and
enthusiasm
gradually
appeared
to
the
girl
like
a
whirling
impetuous
torrent
at
certain
moments
she
fancied
they
were
not
of
themselves
moving
that
they
were
really
being
carried
away
by
the
force
of
the
marseillaise
by
that
hoarse
sonorous
chant
she
could
not
distinguish
any
conversation
she
heard
but
a
continuous
volume
of
sound
alternating
from
bass
to
shrill
notes
as
piercing
as
nails
driven
into
one
s
flesh
this
roar
of
revolt
this
call
to
combat
to
death
with
its
outbursts
of
indignation
its
burning
thirst
for
liberty
its
remarkable
blending
of
bloodthirsty
and
sublime
impulses
unceasingly
smote
her
heart
penetrating
more
deeply
at
each
fierce
outburst
and
filling
her
with
the
voluptuous
pangs
of
a
virgin
martyr
who
stands
erect
and
smiles
under
the
lash
and
the
crowd
flowed
on
ever
amidst
the
same
sonorous
wave
of
sound
the
march
past
which
did
not
really
last
more
than
a
few
minutes
seemed
to
the
young
people
to
be
interminable
truly
miette
was
but
a
child
she
had
turned
pale
at
the
approach
of
the
band
she
had
wept
for
the
loss
of
love
but
she
was
a
brave
child
whose
ardent
nature
was
easily
fired
by
enthusiasm
thus
ardent
emotions
had
gradually
got
possession
of
her
and
she
became
as
courageous
as
a
youth
she
would
willingly
have
seized
a
weapon
and
followed
the
insurgents
as
the
muskets
and
scythes
filed
past
her
white
teeth
glistened
longer
and
sharper
between
her
red
lips
like
the
fangs
of
a
young
wolf
eager
to
bite
and
tear
and
as
she
listened
to
silvere
enumerating
the
contingents
from
the
with
haste
the
pace
of
the
column
seemed
to
her
to
accelerate
still
more
she
soon
fancied
it
all
a
cloud
of
human
dust
swept
along
by
a
tempest
everything
began
to
whirl
before
her
then
she
closed
her
eyes
big
hot
tears
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
silvere
s
eyelashes
were
also
moist
i
don
t
see
the
men
who
left
plassans
this
afternoon
he
murmured
he
tried
to
distinguish
the
end
of
the
column
which
was
still
hidden
by
the
darkness
suddenly
he
cried
with
joyous
exultation
ah
here
they
are
they
ve
got
the
banner
the
banner
has
been
entrusted
to
them
then
he
wanted
to
leap
from
the
slope
in
order
to
join
his
companions
at
this
moment
however
the
insurgents
halted
words
of
command
ran
along
the
column
the
marseillaise
died
out
in
a
final
rumble
and
one
could
only
hear
the
confused
murmuring
of
the
still
surging
crowd
silvere
as
he
listened
caught
the
orders
which
were
passed
on
from
one
contingent
to
another
they
called
the
men
of
plassans
to
the
van
then
as
each
battalion
ranged
itself
alongside
the
road
to
make
way
for
the
banner
the
young
man
reascended
the
embankment
dragging
miette
with
him
come
he
said
we
can
get
across
the
river
before
they
when
they
were
on
the
top
among
the
ploughed
land
they
ran
along
to
a
mill
whose
lock
bars
the
river
then
they
crossed
the
viorne
on
a
plank
placed
there
by
the
millers
and
cut
across
the
meadows
of
running
without
exchanging
a
word
the
column
threw
a
dark
line
over
the
highway
which
they
followed
alongside
the
hedges
there
were
some
gaps
in
the
hawthorns
and
at
last
silvere
and
miette
sprang
on
to
the
road
through
one
of
them
in
spite
of
the
circuitous
way
they
had
come
they
arrived
at
the
same
time
as
the
men
of
plassans
silvere
shook
hands
with
some
of
them
they
must
have
thought
he
had
heard
of
the
new
route
they
had
chosen
and
had
come
to
meet
them
miette
whose
face
was
by
her
hood
was
scrutinised
rather
inquisitively
why
it
s
chantegreil
at
last
said
one
of
the
men
from
the
faubourg
of
plassans
the
niece
of
rebufat
the
of
the
a
is
a
farmer
in
provence
who
shares
the
expenses
and
profits
of
his
farm
with
the
owner
of
the
land
where
have
you
sprung
from
gadabout
cried
another
voice
silvere
intoxicated
with
enthusiasm
had
not
thought
of
the
distress
which
his
sweetheart
would
feel
at
the
jeers
of
the
workmen
miette
all
confusion
looked
at
him
as
if
to
implore
his
aid
but
before
he
could
even
open
his
lips
another
voice
rose
from
the
crowd
brutally
exclaiming
her
father
s
at
the
galleys
we
don
t
want
the
daughter
of
a
thief
and
murderer
amongst
at
this
miette
turned
dreadfully
pale
you
lie
she
muttered
if
my
father
did
kill
anybody
he
never
thieved
and
as
silvere
pale
and
trembling
more
than
she
began
to
clench
his
fists
stop
she
continued
this
is
my
then
turning
to
the
men
she
repeated
with
a
shout
you
lie
you
lie
he
never
stole
a
copper
from
anybody
you
know
it
well
enough
why
do
you
insult
him
when
he
can
t
be
here
she
drew
herself
up
superb
with
indignation
with
her
ardent
nature
she
seemed
to
accept
the
charge
of
murder
composedly
enough
but
that
of
theft
exasperated
her
they
knew
it
and
that
was
why
folks
from
stupid
malice
often
cast
the
accusation
in
her
face
the
man
who
had
just
called
her
father
a
thief
was
merely
repeating
what
he
had
heard
said
for
many
years
the
girl
s
defiant
attitude
only
incited
the
workmen
to
jeer
the
more
silvere
still
had
his
fists
clenched
and
matters
might
have
become
serious
if
a
poacher
from
the
seille
who
had
been
sitting
on
a
heap
of
stones
at
the
roadside
awaiting
the
order
to
march
had
not
come
to
the
girl
s
assistance
the
little
one
s
right
he
said
chantegreil
was
one
of
us
i
knew
him
nobody
knows
the
real
facts
of
his
little
matter
i
always
believed
in
the
truth
of
his
deposition
before
the
judge
the
gendarme
whom
he
brought
down
with
a
bullet
while
he
was
out
shooting
was
no
doubt
taking
aim
at
him
at
the
time
a
man
must
defend
himself
at
all
events
chantegreil
was
a
decent
fellow
he
committed
no
as
often
happens
in
such
cases
the
testimony
of
this
poacher
sufficed
to
bring
other
defenders
to
miette
s
aid
several
workmen
also
professed
to
have
known
chantegreil
yes
yes
it
s
true
they
all
said
he
wasn
t
a
thief
there
are
some
scoundrels
at
plassans
who
ought
to
be
sent
to
prison
in
his
place
chantegreil
was
our
brother
come
now
be
calm
little
miette
had
never
before
heard
anyone
speak
well
of
her
father
he
was
generally
referred
to
as
a
beggar
a
villain
and
now
she
found
good
fellows
who
had
forgiving
words
for
him
and
declared
him
to
be
an
honest
man
she
burst
into
tears
again
full
of
the
emotion
awakened
in
her
by
the
marseillaise
and
she
bethought
herself
how
she
might
thank
these
men
for
their
kindness
to
her
in
misfortune
for
a
moment
she
conceived
the
idea
of
shaking
them
all
by
the
hand
like
a
man
but
her
heart
suggested
something
better
by
her
side
stood
the
insurgent
who
carried
the
banner
she
touched
the
staff
and
to
express
her
gratitude
said
in
an
entreating
tone
give
it
to
me
i
will
carry
the
workmen
understood
the
ingenuous
sublimity
of
this
form
of
gratitude
yes
they
all
cried
chantegreil
shall
carry
the
however
a
woodcutter
remarked
that
she
would
soon
get
tired
and
would
not
be
able
to
go
far
oh
i
m
quite
strong
she
retorted
proudly
tucking
up
her
sleeves
and
showing
a
pair
of
arms
as
big
as
those
of
a
grown
woman
then
as
they
handed
her
the
flag
she
resumed
wait
just
a
forthwith
she
pulled
off
her
cloak
and
put
it
on
again
after
turning
the
red
lining
outside
in
the
clear
moonlight
she
appeared
to
be
arrayed
in
a
purple
mantle
reaching
to
her
feet
the
hood
resting
on
the
edge
of
her
chignon
formed
a
kind
of
phrygian
cap
she
took
the
flag
pressed
the
staff
to
her
bosom
and
held
herself
upright
amid
the
folds
of
that
banner
which
waved
behind
her
enthusiastic
child
that
she
was
her
countenance
with
its
curly
hair
large
eyes
moist
with
tears
and
lips
parted
in
a
smile
seemed
to
rise
with
energetic
pride
as
she
turned
it
towards
the
sky
at
that
moment
she
was
the
virgin
liberty
the
insurgents
burst
into
applause
the
vivid
imagination
of
those
southerners
was
fired
with
enthusiasm
at
the
sudden
apparition
of
this
girl
so
nervously
clasping
their
banner
to
her
bosom
shouts
rose
from
the
nearest
group
bravo
chantegreil
chantegreil
for
ever
she
shall
remain
with
us
she
ll
bring
us
luck
they
would
have
cheered
her
for
a
long
time
yet
had
not
the
order
to
resume
the
march
arrived
whilst
the
column
moved
on
miette
pressed
silvere
s
hand
and
whispered
in
his
ear
you
hear
i
shall
remain
with
you
are
you
glad
silvere
without
replying
returned
the
pressure
he
consented
in
fact
he
was
deeply
affected
unable
to
resist
the
enthusiasm
which
fired
his
companions
miette
seemed
to
him
so
lovely
so
grand
so
saintly
during
the
whole
climb
up
the
hill
he
still
saw
her
before
him
radiant
amidst
a
purple
glory
she
was
now
blended
with
his
other
adored
mistress
the
republic
he
would
have
liked
to
be
in
action
already
with
his
gun
on
his
shoulder
but
the
insurgents
moved
slowly
they
had
orders
to
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
thus
the
column
advanced
between
the
rows
of
elms
like
some
gigantic
serpent
whose
every
ring
had
a
strange
quivering
the
frosty
december
night
had
again
sunk
into
silence
and
the
viorne
alone
seemed
to
roar
more
loudly
on
reaching
the
first
houses
of
the
faubourg
silvere
ran
on
in
front
to
fetch
his
gun
from
the
aire
which
he
found
slumbering
in
the
moonlight
when
he
again
joined
the
insurgents
they
had
reached
the
porte
de
rome
miette
bent
towards
him
and
with
her
childish
smile
observed
i

as
if
i
were
at
the
procession
on
corpus

carrying
the
banner
of

chapter
ii
plassans
is
a
with
about
ten
thousand
inhabitants
built
on
a
plateau
overlooking
the
viorne
and
resting
on
the
north
side
against
the
garrigues
hills
one
of
the
last
spurs
of
the
alps
the
town
is
situated
as
it
were
in
the
depths
of
a
in
it
communicated
with
the
adjoining
country
by
two
roads
only
the
nice
road
which
runs
down
to
the
east
and
the
lyons
road
which
rises
to
the
west
the
one
continuing
the
other
on
almost
parallel
lines
since
that
time
a
railway
has
been
built
which
passes
to
the
south
of
the
town
below
the
hill
which
descends
steeply
from
the
old
ramparts
to
the
river
at
the
present
day
on
coming
out
of
the
station
on
the
right
bank
of
the
little
torrent
one
can
see
by
raising
one
s
head
the
first
houses
of
plassans
with
their
gardens
disposed
in
terrace
fashion
it
is
however
only
after
an
uphill
walk
lasting
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
that
one
reaches
these
houses
about
twenty
years
ago
owing
no
doubt
to
deficient
means
of
communication
there
was
no
town
that
had
more
completely
retained
the
pious
and
aristocratic
character
of
the
old
provencal
cities
plassans
then
had
and
has
even
now
a
whole
district
of
large
mansions
built
in
the
reigns
of
louis
xiv
and
louis
a
dozen
churches
jesuit
and
capuchin
houses
and
a
considerable
number
of
convents
class
distinctions
were
long
perpetuated
by
the
town
s
division
into
various
districts
there
were
three
of
them
each
forming
as
it
were
a
separate
and
complete
locality
with
its
own
churches
promenades
customs
and
landscapes
the
district
of
the
nobility
called
after
the
name
of
one
of
its
parish
churches
is
a
sort
of
miniature
versailles
with
straight
streets
overgrown
with
grass
and
large
square
houses
which
conceal
extensive
gardens
it
extends
to
the
south
along
the
edge
of
the
plateau
some
of
the
mansions
built
on
the
declivity
itself
have
a
double
row
of
terraces
whence
one
can
see
the
whole
valley
of
the
viorne
a
most
charming
vista
much
vaunted
in
that
part
of
the
country
then
on
the
the
old
quarter
formed
of
the
original
town
rears
its
narrow
tortuous
lanes
bordered
with
tottering
hovels
the
the
civil
court
the
market
and
the
gendarmerie
barracks
are
situated
here
this
the
most
populous
part
of
the
plassans
is
inhabited
by
and
all
the
wretched
toiling
common
folk
the
new
town
forms
a
sort
of
parallelogram
to
the
the
those
who
have
slowly
amassed
a
fortune
and
those
engaged
in
the
liberal
professions
here
occupy
houses
set
out
in
straight
lines
and
coloured
a
light
yellow
this
district
which
is
embellished
by
the
an
ugly
plaster
building
decorated
with
numbered
scarcely
five
or
six
streets
in
it
is
of
quite
recent
formation
and
it
is
only
since
the
construction
of
the
railway
that
it
has
been
growing
in
extent
one
circumstance
which
even
at
the
present
time
tends
to
divide
plassans
into
three
distinct
independent
parts
is
that
the
limits
of
the
districts
are
clearly
defined
by
the
principal
thoroughfares
the
cours
sauvaire
and
the
rue
de
rome
which
is
as
it
were
a
narrow
extension
of
the
former
run
from
west
to
east
from
the
grand
to
the
porte
de
rome
thus
cutting
the
town
into
two
portions
and
dividing
the
quarter
of
the
nobility
from
the
others
the
latter
are
themselves
parted
by
the
rue
de
la
banne
this
street
the
finest
in
the
locality
starts
from
the
extremity
of
the
cours
sauvaire
and
ascends
northwards
leaving
the
black
masses
of
the
old
quarter
on
its
left
and
the
houses
of
the
new
town
on
its
right
it
is
here
about
along
the
street
that
stands
the
in
the
rear
of
a
small
square
planted
with
sickly
trees
the
people
of
plassans
are
very
proud
of
this
edifice
as
if
to
keep
more
isolated
and
shut
up
within
itself
the
town
is
belted
with
old
ramparts
which
only
serve
to
increase
its
gloom
and
render
it
more
confined
these
ridiculous
fortifications
preyed
upon
by
ivy
and
crowned
with
wild
gillyflowers
are
about
as
high
and
as
thick
as
the
walls
of
a
convent
and
could
be
demolished
by
gunshot
they
have
several
openings
the
principal
of
which
the
porte
de
rome
and
the
grand
afford
access
to
the
nice
road
and
the
lyons
road
at
the
other
end
of
town
until
these
openings
were
furnished
with
huge
wooden
gates
arched
at
the
top
and
strengthened
with
bars
of
iron
these
gates
were
at
eleven
o
clock
in
summer
and
ten
o
clock
in
winter
the
town
having
thus
shot
its
bolts
like
a
timid
girl
went
quietly
to
sleep
a
keeper
who
lived
in
a
little
cell
in
one
of
the
inner
corners
of
each
gateway
was
authorised
to
admit
belated
persons
but
it
was
necessary
to
stand
parleying
a
long
time
the
keeper
would
not
let
people
in
until
by
the
light
of
his
lantern
he
had
carefully
scrutinised
their
faces
through
a
if
their
looks
displeased
him
they
had
to
sleep
outside
this
custom
of
locking
the
gates
every
evening
was
highly
characteristic
of
the
spirit
of
the
town
which
was
a
commingling
of
cowardice
egotism
routine
exclusiveness
and
devout
longing
for
a
cloistered
life
plassans
when
it
had
shut
itself
up
would
say
to
itself
i
am
at
home
with
the
satisfaction
of
some
pious
bourgeois
who
assured
of
the
safety
of
his
and
certain
that
no
noise
will
disturb
him
duly
says
his
prayers
and
retires
gladly
to
bed
no
other
town
i
believe
has
so
long
persisted
in
thus
incarcerating
itself
like
a
nun
the
population
of
plassans
is
divided
into
three
groups
corresponding
with
the
same
number
of
districts
putting
aside
the
functionaries
the
the
receiver
of
taxes
the
mortgage
commissioner
and
the
postmaster
who
are
all
strangers
to
the
locality
where
they
are
objects
of
envy
rather
than
of
esteem
and
who
live
after
their
own
fashion
the
real
inhabitants
those
who
were
born
there
and
have
every
intention
of
ending
their
days
there
feel
too
much
respect
for
traditional
usages
and
established
boundaries
not
to
pen
themselves
of
their
own
accord
in
one
or
other
of
the
town
s
social
divisions
the
nobility
virtually
cloister
themselves
since
the
fall
of
charles
they
scarcely
ever
go
out
and
when
they
do
they
are
eager
to
return
to
their
large
dismal
mansions
and
walk
along
furtively
as
though
they
were
in
a
hostile
country
they
do
not
visit
anyone
nor
do
they
even
receive
each
other
their
are
frequented
by
a
few
priests
only
they
spend
the
summer
in
the
chateaux
which
they
possess
in
the
environs
in
the
winter
they
sit
round
their
firesides
they
are
as
it
were
dead
people
weary
of
life
and
thus
the
gloomy
silence
of
a
cemetery
hangs
over
their
quarter
of
the
town
the
doors
and
windows
are
carefully
barricaded
one
would
think
their
mansions
were
so
many
convents
shut
off
from
all
the
tumult
of
the
world
at
rare
intervals
an
abbe
whose
measured
tread
adds
to
the
gloomy
silence
of
these
sealed
houses
passes
by
and
glides
like
a
shadow
through
some
doorway
the
people
the
retired
tradesmen
the
lawyers
and
notaries
all
those
of
the
little
ambitious
world
that
inhabits
the
new
town
endeavour
to
infuse
some
liveliness
into
plassans
they
go
to
the
parties
given
by
the
and
dream
of
giving
similar
entertainments
they
eagerly
seek
popularity
call
a
workman
my
good
fellow
chat
with
the
peasants
about
the
harvest
read
the
papers
and
walk
out
with
their
wives
on
sundays
theirs
are
the
enlightened
minds
of
the
district
they
are
the
only
persons
who
venture
to
speak
disparagingly
of
the
ramparts
in
fact
they
have
several
times
demanded
of
the
authorities
the
demolition
of
those
old
walls
relics
of
a
former
age
at
the
same
time
the
most
sceptical
among
them
experience
a
shock
of
delight
whenever
a
marquis
or
a
count
deigns
to
honour
them
with
a
stiff
salutation
indeed
the
dream
of
every
citizen
of
the
new
town
is
to
be
admitted
to
a
of
the
quarter
they
know
very
well
that
their
ambition
is
not
attainable
and
it
is
this
which
makes
them
proclaim
all
the
louder
that
they
are
freethinkers
but
they
are
freethinkers
in
words
only
firm
friends
of
the
authorities
they
are
ready
to
rush
into
the
arms
of
the
first
deliverer
at
the
slightest
indication
of
popular
discontent
the
group
which
toils
and
vegetates
in
the
old
quarter
is
not
so
clearly
defined
as
the
others
the
labouring
classes
are
here
in
a
majority
but
retail
dealers
and
even
a
few
wholesale
traders
are
to
be
found
among
them
as
a
matter
of
fact
plassans
is
far
from
being
a
commercial
centre
there
is
only
just
sufficient
trade
to
dispose
of
the
products
of
the
country
oil
wine
and
almonds
as
for
industrial
labour
it
is
represented
almost
entirely
by
three
or
four
tanyards
a
felt
hat
manufactory
and
some
works
which
last
are
relegated
to
a
corner
of
the
faubourg
this
little
commercial
and
industrial
world
though
it
may
on
high
days
and
holidays
visit
the
people
of
the
new
district
generally
takes
up
its
quarters
among
the
operatives
of
the
old
town
merchants
retail
traders
and
artisans
have
common
interests
which
unite
them
together
on
sundays
only
the
masters
make
themselves
spruce
and
foregather
apart
on
the
other
hand
the
labouring
classes
which
constitute
scarcely
a
fifth
of
the
population
mingle
with
the
idlers
of
the
district
it
is
only
once
a
week
and
during
the
fine
weather
that
the
three
districts
of
plassans
come
together
face
to
face
the
whole
town
repairs
to
the
cours
sauvaire
on
sunday
after
vespers
even
the
nobility
venture
thither
three
distinct
currents
flow
along
this
sort
of
boulevard
planted
with
rows
of
the
citizens
of
the
new
quarter
merely
pass
along
before
quitting
the
town
by
the
grand
and
taking
the
avenue
du
mail
on
the
right
where
they
walk
up
and
down
till
nightfall
meantime
the
nobility
and
the
lower
classes
share
the
cours
sauvaire
between
them
for
more
than
a
century
past
the
nobility
have
selected
the
walk
on
the
south
side
which
is
bordered
with
large
mansions
and
is
the
first
to
escape
the
heat
of
the
sun
the
lower
classes
have
to
rest
content
with
the
walk
on
the
north
where
the
cafes
inns
and
tobacconists
shops
are
located
the
people
and
the
nobility
promenade
the
whole
afternoon
walking
up
and
down
the
cours
without
anyone
of
either
party
thinking
of
changing
sides
they
are
only
separated
by
a
distance
of
some
seven
or
eight
yards
yet
it
is
as
if
they
were
a
thousand
leagues
away
from
each
other
for
they
scrupulously
follow
those
two
parallel
lines
as
though
they
must
not
come
in
contact
here
below
even
during
the
revolutionary
periods
each
party
kept
to
its
own
side
this
regulation
walk
on
sunday
and
the
locking
of
the
town
gates
in
the
evening
are
analogous
instances
which
suffice
to
indicate
the
character
of
the
ten
thousand
people
inhabiting
the
town
here
amidst
these
surroundings
until
the
year
there
vegetated
an
obscure
family
that
enjoyed
little
esteem
but
whose
head
pierre
rougon
subsequently
played
an
important
part
in
life
owing
to
certain
circumstances
pierre
rougon
was
the
son
of
a
peasant
his
mother
s
family
the
fouques
owned
towards
the
end
of
the
last
century
a
large
plot
of
ground
in
the
faubourg
behind
the
old
cemetery
of
this
ground
was
subsequently
joined
to
the
the
fouques
were
the
richest
in
that
part
of
the
country
they
supplied
an
entire
district
of
plassans
with
vegetables
however
their
name
died
out
a
few
years
before
the
revolution
only
one
girl
adelaide
remained
born
in
she
had
become
an
orphan
at
the
age
of
eighteen
this
girl
whose
father
had
died
insane
was
a
long
lank
pale
creature
with
a
scared
look
and
strange
ways
which
one
might
have
taken
for
shyness
so
long
as
she
was
a
little
girl
as
she
grew
up
however
she
became
still
stranger
she
did
certain
things
which
were
inexplicable
even
to
the
cleverest
folk
of
the
faubourg
and
from
that
time
it
was
rumoured
that
she
was
cracked
like
her
father
she
had
scarcely
been
an
orphan
six
months
in
possession
of
a
fortune
which
rendered
her
an
eagerly
sought
heiress
when
it
transpired
that
she
had
married
a
young
gardener
named
rougon
a
peasant
from
the
this
rougon
after
the
death
of
the
last
of
the
male
fouques
who
had
engaged
him
for
a
term
had
remained
in
the
service
of
the
deceased
s
daughter
from
the
situation
of
salaried
servant
he
ascended
rapidly
to
the
enviable
position
of
husband
this
marriage
was
a
first
shock
to
public
opinion
no
one
could
comprehend
why
adelaide
preferred
this
poor
fellow
coarse
heavy
vulgar
scarce
able
to
speak
french
to
those
other
young
men
sons
of
farmers
who
had
been
seen
hovering
round
her
for
some
time
and
as
provincial
people
do
not
allow
anything
to
remain
unexplained
they
made
sure
there
was
some
mystery
at
the
bottom
of
this
affair
alleging
even
that
the
marriage
of
the
two
young
people
had
become
an
absolute
necessity
but
events
proved
the
falsity
of
the
accusation
more
than
a
year
went
by
before
adelaide
had
a
son
the
faubourg
was
annoyed
it
could
not
admit
that
it
was
wrong
and
determined
to
penetrate
the
supposed
mystery
accordingly
all
the
gossips
kept
a
watch
upon
the
rougons
they
soon
found
ample
matter
for
rougon
died
almost
suddenly
fifteen
months
after
his
marriage
from
a
sunstroke
received
one
afternoon
while
he
was
weeding
a
bed
of
carrots
scarcely
a
year
then
elapsed
before
the
young
widow
caused
scandal
it
became
known
as
an
indisputable
fact
that
she
had
a
lover
she
did
not
appear
to
make
any
secret
of
it
several
persons
asserted
that
they
had
heard
her
use
endearing
terms
in
public
to
poor
rougon
s
successor
scarcely
a
year
of
widowhood
and
a
lover
already
such
a
disregard
of
propriety
seemed
monstrous
out
of
all
reason
and
the
scandal
was
heightened
by
adelaide
s
strange
choice
at
that
time
there
dwelt
at
the
end
of
the
impasse
in
a
hovel
the
back
of
which
abutted
on
the
fouques
land
a
man
of
bad
repute
who
was
generally
referred
to
as
that
scoundrel
this
man
would
vanish
for
weeks
and
then
turn
up
some
fine
evening
sauntering
about
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
whistling
as
though
he
had
just
come
from
a
short
walk
and
the
women
sitting
at
their
doorsteps
as
he
passed
there
s
that
scoundrel
macquart
he
has
hidden
his
bales
and
his
gun
in
some
hollow
of
the
the
truth
was
macquart
had
no
means
and
yet
ate
and
drank
like
a
happy
drone
during
his
short
sojourns
in
the
town
he
drank
copiously
and
with
fierce
obstinacy
seating
himself
alone
at
a
table
in
some
tavern
he
would
linger
there
evening
after
evening
with
his
eyes
stupidly
fixed
on
his
glass
neither
seeing
nor
hearing
anything
around
him
when
the
landlord
closed
his
establishment
he
would
retire
with
a
firm
step
with
his
head
raised
as
if
he
were
kept
yet
more
erect
by
inebriation
macquart
walks
so
straight
he
s
surely
dead
drunk
people
used
to
say
as
they
saw
him
going
home
usually
when
he
had
had
no
drink
he
walked
with
a
slight
stoop
and
shunned
the
gaze
of
curious
people
with
a
kind
of
savage
shyness
since
the
death
of
his
father
a
journeyman
tanner
who
had
left
him
as
sole
heritage
the
hovel
in
the
impasse
he
had
never
been
known
to
have
either
relatives
or
friends
the
proximity
of
the
frontiers
and
the
neighbouring
forests
of
the
seille
had
turned
this
singular
lazy
fellow
into
a
combination
of
smuggler
and
poacher
one
of
those
characters
of
whom
observe
i
shouldn
t
care
to
meet
that
man
at
midnight
in
a
dark
tall
with
a
formidable
beard
and
lean
face
macquart
was
the
terror
of
the
good
women
of
the
faubourg
of
plassans
they
actually
accused
him
of
devouring
little
children
raw
though
he
was
hardly
thirty
years
old
he
looked
fifty
amidst
his
bushy
beard
and
the
locks
of
hair
which
hung
over
his
face
in
poodle
fashion
one
could
only
distinguish
the
gleam
of
his
brown
eyes
the
furtive
sorrowful
glance
of
a
man
of
vagrant
instincts
rendered
vicious
by
wine
and
a
pariah
life
although
no
crimes
had
actually
been
brought
home
to
him
no
theft
or
murder
was
ever
perpetrated
in
the
district
without
suspicion
at
once
falling
upon
him
and
it
was
this
ogre
this
brigand
this
scoundrel
macquart
whom
adelaide
had
chosen
in
twenty
months
she
had
two
children
by
him
first
a
boy
and
then
a
girl
there
was
no
question
of
marriage
between
them
never
had
the
faubourg
beheld
such
audacious
impropriety
the
stupefaction
was
so
great
the
idea
of
macquart
having
found
a
young
and
wealthy
mistress
so
completely
upset
the
gossips
that
they
even
spoke
gently
of
adelaide
poor
thing
she
s
gone
quite
mad
they
would
say
if
she
had
any
relatives
she
would
have
been
placed
in
confinement
long
and
as
they
never
knew
anything
of
the
history
of
those
strange
amours
they
accused
that
rogue
macquart
of
having
taken
advantage
of
adelaide
s
weak
mind
to
rob
her
of
her
money
the
legitimate
son
little
pierre
rougon
grew
up
with
his
mother
s
other
offspring
the
latter
antoine
and
ursule
the
young
wolves
as
they
were
called
in
the
district
were
kept
at
home
by
adelaide
who
treated
them
as
affectionately
as
her
first
child
she
did
not
appear
to
entertain
a
very
clear
idea
of
the
position
in
life
reserved
for
these
two
poor
creatures
to
her
they
were
the
same
in
every
respect
as
her
she
would
sometimes
go
out
holding
pierre
with
one
hand
and
antoine
with
the
other
never
noticing
how
differently
the
two
little
fellows
were
already
regarded
it
was
a
strange
home
for
nearly
twenty
years
everyone
lived
there
after
his
or
her
fancy
the
children
like
the
mother
everything
went
on
free
from
control
in
growing
to
womanhood
adelaide
had
retained
the
strangeness
which
had
been
taken
for
shyness
when
she
was
fifteen
it
was
not
that
she
was
insane
as
the
people
of
the
faubourg
asserted
but
there
was
a
lack
of
equilibrium
between
her
nerves
and
her
blood
a
disorder
of
the
brain
and
heart
which
made
her
lead
a
life
out
of
the
ordinary
different
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
world
she
was
certainly
very
natural
very
consistent
with
herself
but
in
the
eyes
of
the
neighbours
her
consistency
became
pure
insanity
she
seemed
desirous
of
making
herself
conspicuous
it
was
thought
she
was
wickedly
determined
to
turn
things
at
home
from
bad
to
worse
whereas
with
great
naivete
she
simply
acted
according
to
the
impulses
of
her
nature
ever
since
giving
birth
to
her
first
child
she
had
been
subject
to
nervous
fits
which
brought
on
terrible
convulsions
these
fits
recurred
periodically
every
two
or
three
months
the
doctors
whom
she
consulted
declared
they
could
do
nothing
for
her
that
age
would
weaken
the
severity
of
the
attacks
they
simply
prescribed
a
dietary
regimen
of
underdone
meat
and
quinine
wine
however
these
repeated
shocks
led
to
cerebral
disorder
she
lived
on
from
day
to
day
like
a
child
like
a
fawning
animal
yielding
to
its
instincts
when
macquart
was
on
his
rounds
she
passed
her
time
in
lazy
pensive
idleness
all
she
did
for
her
children
was
to
kiss
and
play
with
them
then
as
soon
as
her
lover
returned
she
would
disappear
behind
macquart
s
hovel
there
was
a
little
yard
separated
from
the
fouques
property
by
a
wall
one
morning
the
neighbours
were
much
astonished
to
find
in
this
wall
a
door
which
had
not
been
there
the
previous
evening
before
an
hour
had
elapsed
the
entire
faubourg
had
flocked
to
the
neighbouring
windows
the
lovers
must
have
worked
the
whole
night
to
pierce
the
opening
and
place
the
door
there
they
could
now
go
freely
from
one
house
to
the
other
the
scandal
was
revived
everyone
felt
less
pity
for
adelaide
who
was
certainly
the
disgrace
of
the
suburb
she
was
reproached
more
wrathfully
for
that
door
that
tacit
brutal
admission
of
her
union
than
even
for
her
two
illegitimate
children
people
should
at
least
study
appearances
the
most
tolerant
women
would
say
but
adelaide
did
not
understand
what
was
meant
by
studying
appearances
she
was
very
happy
very
proud
of
her
door
she
had
assisted
macquart
to
knock
the
stones
from
the
wall
and
had
even
mixed
the
mortar
so
that
the
work
might
proceed
the
quicker
and
she
came
with
childish
delight
to
inspect
the
work
by
daylight
on
the
morrow
an
act
which
was
deemed
a
climax
of
shamelessness
by
three
gossips
who
observed
her
contemplating
the
masonry
from
that
date
whenever
macquart
reappeared
it
was
thought
as
no
one
then
ever
saw
the
young
woman
that
she
was
living
with
him
in
the
hovel
of
the
impasse
the
smuggler
would
come
very
irregularly
almost
always
unexpectedly
to
plassans
nobody
ever
knew
what
life
the
lovers
led
during
the
two
or
three
days
he
spent
there
at
distant
intervals
they
used
to
shut
themselves
up
the
little
dwelling
seemed
uninhabited
then
as
the
gossips
had
declared
that
macquart
had
simply
seduced
adelaide
in
order
to
spend
her
money
they
were
astonished
after
a
time
to
see
him
still
lead
his
wonted
life
ever
up
hill
and
down
dale
and
as
badly
equipped
as
previously
perhaps
the
young
woman
loved
him
all
the
more
for
seeing
him
at
rare
intervals
perhaps
he
had
disregarded
her
entreaties
feeling
an
irresistible
desire
for
a
life
of
adventure
the
gossips
invented
a
thousand
fables
without
succeeding
in
giving
any
reasonable
explanation
of
a
connection
which
had
originated
and
continued
in
so
strange
a
manner
the
hovel
in
the
impasse
remained
closed
and
preserved
its
secrets
it
was
merely
guessed
that
macquart
had
probably
acquired
the
habit
of
beating
adelaide
although
the
sound
of
a
quarrel
never
issued
from
the
house
however
on
several
occasions
she
was
seen
with
her
face
black
and
blue
and
her
hair
torn
away
at
the
same
time
she
did
not
display
the
least
dejection
or
grief
nor
did
she
seek
in
any
way
to
hide
her
bruises
she
smiled
and
seemed
happy
no
doubt
she
allowed
herself
to
be
beaten
without
breathing
a
word
this
existence
lasted
for
more
than
fifteen
years
at
times
when
adelaide
returned
home
she
would
find
her
house
upside
down
but
would
not
take
the
least
notice
of
it
she
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
practical
meaning
of
life
of
the
proper
value
of
things
and
the
necessity
for
order
she
let
her
children
grow
up
like
those
which
sprout
along
the
highways
at
the
pleasure
of
the
rain
and
sun
they
bore
their
natural
fruits
like
wild
stock
which
has
never
known
grafting
or
pruning
never
was
nature
allowed
such
complete
sway
never
did
such
mischievous
creatures
grow
up
more
freely
under
the
sole
influence
of
instinct
they
rolled
among
the
vegetables
passed
their
days
in
the
open
air
playing
and
fighting
like
urchins
they
stole
provisions
from
the
house
and
pillaged
the
few
in
the
enclosure
they
were
the
plundering
squalling
familiar
demons
of
this
strange
abode
of
lucid
insanity
when
their
mother
was
absent
for
days
together
they
would
make
such
an
uproar
and
hit
upon
such
diabolical
devices
for
annoying
people
that
the
neighbours
had
to
threaten
them
with
a
whipping
moreover
adelaide
did
not
inspire
them
with
much
fear
if
they
were
less
obnoxious
to
other
people
when
she
was
at
home
it
was
because
they
made
her
their
victim
shirking
school
five
or
six
times
a
week
and
doing
everything
they
could
to
receive
some
punishment
which
would
allow
them
to
squall
to
their
hearts
content
but
she
never
beat
them
nor
even
lost
her
temper
she
lived
on
very
well
placidly
indolently
in
a
state
of
mental
abstraction
amidst
all
the
uproar
at
last
indeed
this
uproar
became
indispensable
to
her
to
fill
the
void
in
her
brain
she
smiled
complacently
when
she
heard
anyone
say
her
children
will
beat
her
some
day
and
it
will
serve
her
to
all
remarks
her
utter
indifference
seemed
to
reply
what
does
it
matter
she
troubled
even
less
about
her
property
than
about
her
children
the
fouques
enclosure
during
the
many
years
that
this
singular
existence
lasted
would
have
become
a
piece
of
waste
ground
if
the
young
woman
had
not
luckily
entrusted
the
cultivation
of
her
vegetables
to
a
clever
this
man
who
was
to
share
the
profits
with
her
robbed
her
impudently
though
she
never
noticed
it
this
circumstance
had
its
advantages
however
for
in
order
to
steal
the
more
the
gardener
drew
as
much
as
possible
from
the
land
which
in
the
result
almost
doubled
in
value
pierre
the
legitimate
son
either
from
secret
instinct
or
from
his
knowledge
of
the
different
manner
in
which
he
and
the
others
were
regarded
by
the
neighbours
domineered
over
his
brother
and
sister
from
an
early
age
in
their
quarrels
although
he
was
much
weaker
than
antoine
he
always
got
the
better
of
the
contest
beating
the
other
with
all
the
authority
of
a
master
with
regard
to
ursule
a
poor
puny
wan
little
creature
she
was
handled
with
equal
roughness
by
both
the
boys
indeed
until
they
were
fifteen
or
sixteen
the
three
children
fraternally
beat
each
other
without
understanding
their
vague
mutual
hatred
without
realising
how
foreign
they
were
to
one
another
it
was
only
in
youth
that
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
definite
personalities
at
sixteen
antoine
was
a
tall
fellow
a
blend
of
macquart
s
and
adelaide
s
failings
macquart
however
predominated
in
him
with
his
love
of
vagrancy
his
tendency
to
drunkenness
and
his
brutish
savagery
at
the
same
time
under
the
influence
of
adelaide
s
nervous
nature
the
vices
which
in
the
father
assumed
a
kind
of
sanguinary
frankness
were
in
the
son
tinged
with
an
artfulness
full
of
hypocrisy
and
cowardice
antoine
resembled
his
mother
by
his
total
want
of
dignified
will
by
his
effeminate
voluptuous
egotism
which
disposed
him
to
accept
any
bed
of
infamy
provided
he
could
lounge
upon
it
at
his
ease
and
sleep
warmly
in
it
people
said
of
him
ah
the
brigand
he
hasn
t
even
the
courage
of
his
villainy
like
macquart
if
ever
he
commits
a
murder
it
will
be
with
pin
physically
antoine
inherited
adelaide
s
thick
lips
only
his
other
features
resembled
those
of
the
smuggler
but
they
were
softer
and
more
prone
to
change
of
expression
in
ursule
on
the
other
hand
physical
and
moral
resemblance
to
the
mother
predominated
there
was
a
mixture
of
certain
characteristics
in
her
also
but
born
the
last
at
a
time
when
adelaide
s
love
was
warmer
than
macquart
s
the
poor
little
thing
seemed
to
have
received
with
her
sex
a
deeper
impress
of
her
mother
s
temperament
moreover
hers
was
not
a
fusion
of
the
two
natures
but
rather
a
juxtaposition
a
remarkably
close
soldering
ursule
was
whimsical
and
displayed
at
times
the
shyness
the
melancholy
and
the
transports
of
a
pariah
then
she
would
often
break
out
into
nervous
fits
of
laughter
and
muse
lazily
like
a
woman
unsound
both
in
head
and
heart
her
eyes
which
at
times
had
a
scared
expression
like
those
of
adelaide
were
as
limpid
as
crystal
similar
to
those
of
kittens
doomed
to
die
of
consumption
in
presence
of
those
two
illegitimate
children
pierre
seemed
a
stranger
to
one
who
had
not
penetrated
to
the
roots
of
his
being
he
would
have
appeared
profoundly
dissimilar
never
did
child
s
nature
show
a
more
equal
balance
of
the
characteristics
of
its
parents
he
was
the
exact
mean
between
the
peasant
rougon
and
the
nervous
adelaide
paternal
grossness
was
attenuated
by
the
maternal
influence
one
found
in
him
the
first
phase
of
that
evolution
of
temperaments
which
ultimately
brings
about
the
amelioration
or
deterioration
of
a
race
although
he
was
still
a
peasant
his
skin
was
less
coarse
his
face
less
heavy
his
intellect
more
capacious
and
more
supple
in
him
the
defects
of
his
father
and
his
mother
had
advantageously
reacted
upon
each
other
if
adelaide
s
nature
rendered
exquisitely
sensitive
by
her
rebellious
nerves
had
combated
and
lessened
rougon
s
ponderosity
the
latter
had
successfully
prevented
the
young
woman
s
tendency
to
cerebral
disorder
from
being
implanted
in
the
child
pierre
knew
neither
the
passions
nor
the
sickly
ravings
of
macquart
s
young
whelps
very
badly
brought
up
unruly
and
noisy
like
all
children
who
are
not
restrained
during
their
infancy
he
nevertheless
possessed
at
bottom
such
sense
and
intelligence
as
would
always
preserve
him
from
perpetrating
any
unproductive
folly
his
vices
his
laziness
his
appetite
for
indulgence
lacked
the
instinctiveness
which
characterised
antoine
s
he
meant
to
cultivate
and
gratify
them
honourably
and
openly
in
his
plump
person
of
medium
height
in
his
long
pale
face
in
which
the
features
derived
from
his
father
had
acquired
some
of
the
maternal
refinement
one
could
already
detect
signs
of
sly
and
crafty
ambition
and
insatiable
desire
with
the
hardness
of
heart
and
envious
hatred
of
a
peasant
s
son
whom
his
mother
s
means
and
nervous
temperament
had
turned
into
a
member
of
the
middle
classes
when
at
the
age
of
seventeen
pierre
observed
and
was
able
to
understand
adelaide
s
disorders
and
the
singular
position
of
antoine
and
ursule
he
seemed
neither
sorry
nor
indignant
but
simply
worried
as
to
the
course
which
would
best
serve
his
own
interests
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
three
children
who
had
pursued
his
studies
with
any
industry
when
a
peasant
begins
to
feel
the
need
of
instruction
he
most
frequently
becomes
a
fierce
calculator
at
school
pierre
s
playmates
roused
his
first
suspicions
by
the
manner
in
which
they
treated
and
hooted
his
brother
later
on
he
came
to
understand
the
significance
of
many
looks
and
words
and
at
last
he
clearly
saw
that
the
house
was
being
pillaged
from
that
time
forward
he
regarded
antoine
and
ursule
as
shameless
parasites
mouths
that
were
devouring
his
own
substance
like
the
people
of
the
faubourg
he
thought
that
his
mother
was
a
fit
subject
for
a
lunatic
asylum
and
feared
she
would
end
by
squandering
all
her
money
if
he
did
not
take
steps
to
prevent
it
what
gave
him
the
finishing
stroke
was
the
dishonesty
of
the
gardener
who
cultivated
the
land
at
this
in
one
day
the
unruly
child
was
transformed
into
a
thrifty
selfish
lad
hurriedly
matured
as
regards
his
instincts
by
the
strange
improvident
life
which
he
could
no
longer
bear
to
see
around
him
without
a
feeling
of
anguish
those
vegetables
from
the
sale
of
which
the
derived
the
largest
profits
really
belonged
to
him
the
wine
which
his
mother
s
offspring
drank
the
bread
they
ate
also
belonged
to
him
the
whole
house
the
entire
fortune
was
his
by
right
according
to
his
boorish
logic
he
alone
the
legitimate
son
was
the
heir
and
as
his
riches
were
in
danger
as
everybody
was
greedily
gnawing
at
his
future
fortune
he
sought
a
means
of
turning
them
all
out
mother
brother
sister
servants
and
of
succeeding
immediately
to
his
inheritance
the
conflict
was
a
cruel
one
the
lad
knew
that
he
must
first
strike
his
mother
step
by
step
with
patient
tenacity
he
executed
a
plan
whose
every
detail
he
had
long
previously
thought
out
his
tactics
were
to
appear
before
adelaide
like
a
living
reproach
not
that
he
flew
into
a
passion
or
upbraided
her
for
her
misconduct
but
he
had
acquired
a
certain
manner
of
looking
at
her
without
saying
a
word
which
terrified
her
whenever
she
returned
from
a
short
sojourn
in
macquart
s
hovel
she
could
not
turn
her
eyes
on
her
son
without
a
shudder
she
felt
his
cold
glances
as
sharp
as
steel
blades
pierce
her
deeply
and
pitilessly
the
severe
taciturn
demeanour
of
the
child
of
the
man
whom
she
had
so
soon
forgotten
strangely
troubled
her
poor
disordered
brain
she
would
fancy
at
times
that
rougon
had
risen
from
the
dead
to
punish
her
for
her
dissoluteness
every
week
she
fell
into
one
of
those
nervous
fits
which
were
shattering
her
constitution
she
was
left
to
struggle
until
she
recovered
consciousness
after
which
she
would
creep
about
more
feebly
than
ever
she
would
also
often
sob
the
whole
night
long
holding
her
head
in
her
hands
and
accepting
the
wounds
that
pierre
dealt
her
with
resignation
as
if
they
had
been
the
strokes
of
an
avenging
deity
at
other
times
she
repudiated
him
she
would
not
acknowledge
her
own
flesh
and
blood
in
that
lad
whose
calmness
chilled
her
own
feverishness
so
painfully
she
would
a
thousand
times
rather
have
been
beaten
than
glared
at
like
that
those
implacable
looks
which
followed
her
everywhere
threw
her
at
last
into
such
unbearable
torments
that
on
several
occasions
she
determined
to
see
her
lover
no
more
as
soon
however
as
macquart
returned
she
forgot
her
vows
and
hastened
to
him
the
conflict
with
her
son
began
afresh
silent
and
terrible
when
she
came
back
home
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
she
fell
completely
under
his
sway
she
stood
before
him
like
a
child
doubtful
of
her
behaviour
and
fearing
that
she
deserves
a
whipping
pierre
had
skilfully
bound
her
hand
and
foot
and
made
a
very
submissive
servant
of
her
without
opening
his
lips
without
once
entering
into
difficult
and
compromising
explanations
when
the
young
man
felt
that
his
mother
was
in
his
power
that
he
could
treat
her
like
a
slave
he
began
in
his
own
interest
to
turn
her
cerebral
weakness
and
the
foolish
terror
with
which
his
glances
inspired
her
to
his
own
advantage
his
first
care
as
soon
as
he
was
master
at
home
was
to
dismiss
the
and
replace
him
by
one
of
his
own
creatures
then
he
took
upon
himself
the
supreme
direction
of
the
household
selling
buying
and
holding
the
on
the
other
hand
he
made
no
attempt
to
regulate
adelaide
s
actions
or
to
correct
antoine
and
ursule
for
their
laziness
that
mattered
little
to
him
for
he
counted
upon
getting
rid
of
these
people
as
soon
as
an
opportunity
presented
itself
he
contented
himself
with
portioning
out
their
bread
and
water
then
having
already
got
all
the
property
in
his
own
hands
he
awaited
an
event
which
would
permit
him
to
dispose
of
it
as
he
pleased
circumstances
proved
singularly
favourable
he
escaped
the
conscription
on
the
ground
of
being
a
widow
s
eldest
son
but
two
years
later
antoine
was
called
out
his
bad
luck
did
not
affect
him
much
he
counted
on
his
mother
purchasing
a
substitute
for
him
adelaide
in
fact
wished
to
save
him
from
serving
pierre
however
who
held
the
money
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
her
his
brother
s
compulsory
departure
would
be
a
lucky
event
for
him
and
greatly
assist
the
accomplishment
of
his
plans
when
his
mother
mentioned
the
matter
to
him
he
gave
her
such
a
look
that
she
did
not
venture
to
pursue
it
his
glance
plainly
signified
do
you
wish
then
to
ruin
me
for
the
sake
of
your
illegitimate
offspring
forthwith
she
selfishly
abandoned
antoine
for
before
everything
else
she
sought
her
own
peace
and
quietness
pierre
who
did
not
like
violent
measures
and
who
rejoiced
at
being
able
to
eject
his
brother
without
a
disturbance
then
played
the
part
of
a
man
in
despair
the
year
had
been
a
bad
one
money
was
scarce
and
to
raise
any
he
would
be
compelled
to
sell
a
portion
of
the
land
which
would
be
the
beginning
of
their
ruin
then
he
pledged
his
word
of
honour
to
antoine
that
he
would
buy
him
out
the
following
year
though
he
meant
to
do
nothing
of
the
kind
antoine
then
went
off
duped
and
half
satisfied
pierre
got
rid
of
ursule
in
a
still
more
unexpected
manner
a
journeyman
hatter
of
the
faubourg
named
mouret
conceived
a
real
affection
for
the
girl
whom
he
thought
as
white
and
delicate
as
any
young
lady
from
the
quarter
he
married
her
on
his
part
it
was
a
love
match
free
from
all
sordid
motives
as
for
ursule
she
accepted
the
marriage
in
order
to
escape
a
home
where
her
eldest
brother
rendered
life
intolerable
her
mother
absorbed
in
her
own
courses
and
using
her
remaining
energy
to
defend
her
own
particular
interests
regarded
the
matter
with
absolute
indifference
she
was
even
glad
of
ursule
s
departure
from
the
house
hoping
that
pierre
now
that
he
had
no
further
cause
for
dissatisfaction
would
let
her
live
in
peace
after
her
own
fashion
no
sooner
had
the
young
people
been
married
than
mouret
perceived
that
he
would
have
to
quit
plassans
if
he
did
not
wish
to
hear
endless
disparaging
remarks
about
his
wife
and
his
taking
ursule
with
him
he
accordingly
repaired
to
marseilles
where
he
worked
at
his
trade
it
should
be
mentioned
that
he
had
not
asked
for
one
sou
of
dowry
when
pierre
somewhat
surprised
by
this
disinterestedness
commenced
to
stammer
out
some
explanations
mouret
closed
his
mouth
by
saying
that
he
preferred
to
earn
his
wife
s
bread
nevertheless
the
worthy
son
of
the
peasant
remained
uneasy
mouret
s
indifference
seemed
to
him
to
conceal
some
trap
adelaide
now
remained
to
be
disposed
of
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
induced
pierre
to
live
with
her
any
longer
she
was
compromising
him
it
was
with
her
that
he
would
have
liked
to
make
a
start
but
he
found
himself
between
two
very
embarrassing
alternatives
to
keep
her
and
thus
in
a
measure
share
her
disgrace
and
bind
a
fetter
to
his
feet
which
would
arrest
him
in
his
ambitious
flight
or
to
turn
her
out
with
the
certainty
of
being
pointed
at
as
a
bad
son
which
would
have
robbed
him
of
the
reputation
for
good
nature
which
he
desired
knowing
that
he
would
be
in
want
of
everybody
he
desired
to
secure
an
untarnished
name
throughout
plassans
there
was
but
one
method
to
adopt
namely
to
induce
adelaide
to
leave
of
her
own
accord
pierre
neglected
nothing
to
accomplish
this
end
he
considered
his
mother
s
misconduct
a
sufficient
excuse
for
his
own
he
punished
her
as
one
would
chastise
a
child
the
tables
were
turned
the
poor
woman
cowered
under
the
stick
which
figuratively
was
constantly
held
over
her
she
was
scarcely
years
old
and
already
had
the
stammerings
of
terror
and
vague
pitiful
looks
of
an
old
woman
in
her
dotage
her
son
continued
to
stab
her
with
his
piercing
glances
hoping
that
she
would
run
away
when
her
courage
was
exhausted
the
unfortunate
woman
suffered
terribly
from
shame
restrained
desire
and
enforced
cowardice
receiving
the
blows
dealt
her
with
passive
resignation
and
nevertheless
returning
to
macquart
with
the
determination
to
die
on
the
spot
rather
than
submit
there
were
nights
when
she
would
have
got
out
of
bed
and
thrown
herself
into
the
viorne
if
with
her
weak
nervous
nature
she
had
not
felt
the
greatest
fear
of
death
on
several
occasions
she
thought
of
running
away
and
joining
her
lover
on
the
frontier
it
was
only
because
she
did
not
know
whither
to
go
that
she
remained
in
the
house
submitting
to
her
son
s
contemptuous
silence
and
secret
brutality
pierre
divined
that
she
would
have
left
long
ago
if
she
had
only
had
a
refuge
he
was
waiting
an
opportunity
to
take
a
little
apartment
for
her
somewhere
when
a
fortuitous
occurrence
which
he
had
not
ventured
to
anticipate
abruptly
brought
about
the
realisation
of
his
desires
information
reached
the
faubourg
that
macquart
had
just
been
killed
on
the
frontier
by
a
shot
from
a
officer
at
the
moment
when
he
was
endeavouring
to
smuggle
a
load
of
geneva
watches
into
france
the
story
was
true
the
smuggler
s
body
was
not
even
brought
home
but
was
interred
in
the
cemetery
of
a
little
mountain
village
adelaide
s
grief
plunged
her
into
stupor
her
son
who
watched
her
curiously
did
not
see
her
shed
a
tear
macquart
had
made
her
sole
legatee
she
inherited
his
hovel
in
the
impasse
and
his
carbine
which
a
braving
the
balls
of
the
officers
loyally
brought
back
to
her
on
the
following
day
she
retired
to
the
little
house
hung
the
carbine
above
the
mantelpiece
and
lived
there
estranged
from
all
the
world
solitary
and
silent
pierre
was
at
last
sole
master
of
the
house
the
fouques
land
belonged
to
him
in
fact
if
not
in
law
he
never
thought
of
establishing
himself
on
it
it
was
too
narrow
a
field
for
his
ambition
to
till
the
ground
and
cultivate
vegetables
seemed
to
him
boorish
unworthy
of
his
faculties
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
divest
himself
of
everything
recalling
the
peasant
with
his
nature
refined
by
his
mother
s
nervous
temperament
he
felt
an
irresistible
longing
for
the
enjoyments
of
the
middle
classes
in
all
his
calculations
therefore
he
had
regarded
the
sale
of
the
fouques
property
as
the
final
consummation
this
sale
by
placing
a
round
sum
of
money
in
his
hands
would
enable
him
to
marry
the
daughter
of
some
merchant
who
would
take
him
into
partnership
at
this
period
the
wars
of
the
first
empire
were
greatly
thinning
the
ranks
of
eligible
young
men
parents
were
not
so
fastidious
as
previously
in
the
choice
of
a
pierre
persuaded
himself
that
money
would
smooth
all
difficulties
and
that
the
gossip
of
the
faubourg
would
be
overlooked
he
intended
to
pose
as
a
victim
as
an
honest
man
suffering
from
a
family
disgrace
which
he
deplored
without
being
soiled
by
it
or
excusing
it
for
several
months
already
he
had
cast
his
eyes
on
a
certain
felicite
puech
the
daughter
of
an
the
firm
of
puech
lacamp
whose
warehouses
were
in
one
of
the
darkest
lanes
of
the
old
quarter
was
far
from
prosperous
it
enjoyed
but
doubtful
credit
in
the
market
and
people
talked
vaguely
of
bankruptcy
it
was
precisely
in
consequence
of
these
evil
reports
that
pierre
turned
his
batteries
in
this
direction
no
trader
would
have
given
him
his
daughter
he
meant
to
appear
on
the
scene
at
the
very
moment
when
old
puech
should
no
longer
know
which
way
to
turn
he
would
then
purchase
felicite
of
him
and
the
credit
of
the
house
by
his
own
energy
and
intelligence
it
was
a
clever
expedient
for
ascending
the
first
rung
of
the
social
ladder
for
raising
himself
above
his
station
above
all
things
he
wished
to
escape
from
that
frightful
faubourg
where
everybody
reviled
his
family
and
to
obliterate
all
these
foul
legends
by
effacing
even
the
very
name
of
the
fouques
enclosure
for
that
reason
the
filthy
streets
of
the
old
quarter
seemed
to
him
perfect
paradise
there
only
he
would
be
able
to
change
his
skin
the
moment
which
he
had
been
awaiting
soon
arrived
the
firm
of
puech
and
lacamp
seemed
to
be
at
the
last
gasp
the
young
man
then
negotiated
the
match
with
prudent
skill
he
was
received
if
not
as
a
deliverer
at
least
as
a
necessary
and
acceptable
expedient
the
marriage
agreed
upon
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
sale
of
the
ground
the
owner
of
the
desiring
to
enlarge
his
estate
had
made
him
repeated
offers
a
low
thin
alone
separated
the
two
estates
pierre
speculated
on
the
eagerness
of
his
wealthy
neighbour
who
to
gratify
his
caprice
offered
as
much
as
fifty
thousand
francs
for
the
land
it
was
double
its
value
pierre
whoever
with
the
craftiness
of
a
peasant
pulled
a
long
face
and
said
that
he
did
not
care
to
sell
that
his
mother
would
never
consent
to
get
rid
of
the
property
where
the
fouques
had
lived
from
father
to
son
for
nearly
two
centuries
but
all
the
time
that
he
was
seemingly
holding
back
he
was
really
making
preparations
for
the
sale
certain
doubts
had
arisen
in
his
mind
according
to
his
own
brutal
logic
the
property
belonged
to
him
he
had
the
right
to
dispose
of
it
as
he
chose
beneath
this
assurance
however
he
had
vague
presentiments
of
legal
complications
so
he
indirectly
consulted
a
lawyer
of
the
faubourg
he
learnt
some
fine
things
from
him
according
to
the
lawyer
his
hands
were
completely
tied
his
mother
alone
could
alienate
the
property
and
he
doubted
whether
she
would
but
what
he
did
not
know
what
came
as
a
heavy
blow
to
him
was
that
ursule
and
antoine
those
young
wolves
had
claims
on
the
estate
what
they
would
despoil
him
rob
him
the
legitimate
child
the
lawyer
s
explanations
were
clear
and
precise
however
adelaide
it
is
true
had
married
rougon
under
the
common
property
system
but
as
the
whole
fortune
consisted
of
land
the
young
woman
according
to
law
again
came
into
possession
of
everything
at
her
husband
s
death
moreover
macquart
and
adelaide
had
duly
acknowledged
their
children
when
declaring
their
birth
for
registration
and
thus
these
children
were
entitled
to
inherit
from
their
mother
for
sole
consolation
pierre
learnt
that
the
law
reduced
the
share
of
illegitimate
children
in
favour
of
the
others
this
however
did
not
console
him
at
all
he
wanted
to
have
everything
he
would
not
have
shared
ten
sous
with
ursule
and
antoine
this
vista
of
the
intricacies
of
the
code
opened
up
a
new
horizon
which
he
scanned
with
a
singularly
thoughtful
air
he
soon
recognised
that
a
shrewd
man
must
always
keep
the
law
on
his
side
and
this
is
what
he
devised
without
consulting
anyone
even
the
lawyer
whose
suspicions
he
was
afraid
of
arousing
he
knew
how
to
turn
his
mother
round
his
finger
one
fine
morning
he
took
her
to
a
notary
and
made
her
sign
a
deed
of
sale
provided
she
were
left
the
hovel
in
the
impasse
adelaide
would
have
sold
all
plassans
besides
pierre
assured
her
an
annual
income
of
six
hundred
francs
and
made
the
most
solemn
promises
to
watch
over
his
brother
and
sister
this
oath
satisfied
the
good
woman
she
recited
before
the
notary
the
lesson
which
it
had
pleased
her
son
to
teach
her
on
the
following
day
the
young
man
made
her
place
her
name
at
the
foot
of
a
document
in
which
she
acknowledged
having
received
fifty
thousand
francs
as
the
price
of
the
property
this
was
his
stroke
of
genius
the
act
of
a
rogue
he
contented
himself
with
telling
his
mother
who
was
a
little
surprised
at
signing
such
a
receipt
when
she
had
not
seen
a
centime
of
the
fifty
thousand
francs
that
it
was
a
pure
formality
of
no
consequence
whatever
as
he
slipped
the
paper
into
his
pocket
he
thought
to
himself
now
let
the
young
wolves
ask
me
to
render
an
account
i
will
tell
them
the
old
woman
has
squandered
everything
they
will
never
dare
to
go
to
law
with
me
about
a
week
afterwards
the
no
longer
existed
a
plough
had
turned
up
the
vegetable
beds
the
fouques
enclosure
in
accordance
with
young
rougon
s
wish
was
about
to
become
a
thing
of
the
past
a
few
months
later
the
owner
of
the
even
had
the
old
s
house
which
was
falling
to
pieces
pulled
down
when
pierre
had
secured
the
fifty
thousand
francs
he
married
felicite
puech
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
felicite
was
a
short
dark
woman
such
as
one
often
meets
in
provence
she
looked
like
one
of
those
brown
lean
noisy
grasshoppers
which
in
their
sudden
leaps
often
strike
their
heads
against
the
thin
with
pointed
shoulders
and
a
face
like
that
of
a
her
features
singularly
sunken
and
attenuated
it
was
not
easy
to
tell
her
age
she
looked
as
near
fifteen
as
thirty
although
she
was
in
reality
only
nineteen
four
years
younger
than
her
husband
there
was
much
feline
slyness
in
the
depths
of
her
little
black
eyes
which
suggested
gimlet
holes
her
low
bumpy
forehead
her
slightly
depressed
nose
with
delicate
quivering
nostrils
her
thin
red
lips
and
prominent
chin
parted
from
her
cheeks
by
strange
hollows
all
suggested
the
countenance
of
an
artful
dwarf
a
living
mask
of
intrigue
an
active
envious
ambition
with
all
her
ugliness
however
felicite
possessed
a
sort
of
gracefulness
which
rendered
her
seductive
people
said
of
her
that
she
could
be
pretty
or
ugly
as
she
pleased
it
would
depend
on
the
fashion
in
which
she
tied
her
magnificent
hair
but
it
depended
still
more
on
the
triumphant
smile
which
illumined
her
golden
complexion
when
she
thought
she
had
got
the
better
of
somebody
born
under
an
evil
star
and
believing
herself
by
fortune
she
was
generally
content
to
appear
an
ugly
creature
she
did
not
however
intend
to
abandon
the
struggle
for
she
had
vowed
that
she
would
some
day
make
the
whole
town
burst
with
envy
by
an
insolent
display
of
happiness
and
luxury
had
she
been
able
to
act
her
part
on
a
more
spacious
stage
where
full
play
would
have
been
allowed
her
ready
wit
she
would
have
quickly
brought
her
dream
to
pass
her
intelligence
was
far
superior
to
that
of
the
girls
of
her
own
station
and
education
evil
tongues
asserted
that
her
mother
who
had
died
a
few
years
after
she
was
born
had
during
the
early
period
of
her
married
life
been
familiar
with
the
marquis
de
carnavant
a
young
nobleman
of
the
quarter
in
fact
felicite
had
the
hands
and
feet
of
a
marchioness
and
in
this
respect
did
not
appear
to
belong
to
that
class
of
workers
from
which
she
was
descended
her
marriage
with
pierre
rougon
that
that
man
of
the
faubourg
whose
family
was
in
such
bad
odour
kept
the
old
quarter
in
a
state
of
astonishment
for
more
than
a
month
she
let
people
gossip
however
receiving
the
stiff
congratulations
of
her
friends
with
strange
smiles
her
calculations
had
been
made
she
had
chosen
rougon
for
a
husband
as
one
would
choose
an
accomplice
her
father
in
accepting
the
young
man
had
merely
had
eyes
for
the
fifty
thousand
francs
which
were
to
save
him
from
bankruptcy
felicite
however
was
more
she
looked
into
the
future
and
felt
that
she
would
be
in
want
of
a
robust
man
even
if
he
were
somewhat
rustic
behind
whom
she
might
conceal
herself
and
whose
limbs
she
would
move
at
will
she
entertained
a
deliberate
hatred
for
the
insignificant
little
exquisites
of
provincial
towns
the
lean
herd
of
notaries
clerks
and
prospective
barristers
who
stand
shivering
with
cold
while
waiting
for
clients
having
no
dowry
and
despairing
of
ever
marrying
a
rich
merchant
s
son
she
by
far
preferred
a
peasant
whom
she
could
use
as
a
passive
tool
to
some
lank
graduate
who
would
overwhelm
her
with
his
academical
superiority
and
drag
her
about
all
her
life
in
search
of
hollow
vanities
she
was
of
opinion
that
the
woman
ought
to
make
the
man
she
believed
herself
capable
of
carving
a
minister
out
of
a
that
which
had
attracted
her
in
rougon
was
his
broad
chest
his
heavy
frame
which
was
not
altogether
wanting
in
elegance
a
man
thus
built
would
bear
with
ease
and
sprightliness
the
mass
of
intrigues
which
she
dreamt
of
placing
on
his
shoulders
however
while
she
appreciated
her
husband
s
strength
and
vigour
she
also
perceived
that
he
was
far
from
being
a
fool
under
his
coarse
flesh
she
had
divined
the
cunning
suppleness
of
his
mind
still
she
was
a
long
way
from
really
knowing
her
rougon
she
thought
him
far
stupider
than
he
was
a
few
days
after
her
marriage
as
she
was
by
chance
fumbling
in
the
drawer
of
a
secretaire
she
came
across
the
receipt
for
fifty
thousand
francs
which
adelaide
had
signed
at
sight
of
it
she
understood
things
and
felt
rather
frightened
her
own
natural
average
honesty
rendered
her
hostile
to
such
expedients
her
terror
however
was
not
unmixed
with
admiration
rougon
became
in
her
eyes
a
very
smart
fellow
the
young
couple
bravely
sought
to
conquer
fortune
the
firm
of
puech
lacamp
was
not
after
all
so
embarrassed
as
pierre
had
thought
its
liabilities
were
small
it
was
merely
in
want
of
in
the
provinces
traders
adopt
prudent
courses
to
save
them
from
serious
disasters
puech
lacamp
were
prudent
to
an
excessive
degree
they
never
risked
a
thousand
crowns
without
the
greatest
fear
and
thus
their
house
a
veritable
hole
was
an
unimportant
one
the
fifty
thousand
francs
that
pierre
brought
into
it
sufficed
to
pay
the
debts
and
extend
the
business
the
beginnings
were
good
during
three
successive
years
the
olive
harvest
was
an
abundant
one
felicite
by
a
bold
stroke
which
absolutely
frightened
both
pierre
and
old
puech
made
them
purchase
a
considerable
quantity
of
oil
which
they
stored
in
their
warehouse
during
the
following
years
as
the
young
woman
had
foreseen
the
crops
failed
and
a
considerable
rise
in
prices
having
set
in
they
realised
large
profits
by
selling
out
their
stock
a
short
time
after
this
haul
puech
lacamp
retired
from
the
firm
content
with
the
few
sous
they
had
just
secured
and
ambitious
of
living
on
their
incomes
the
young
couple
now
had
sole
control
of
the
business
and
thought
that
they
had
at
last
laid
the
foundation
of
their
fortune
you
have
vanquished
my
felicite
would
sometimes
say
to
her
husband
one
of
the
rare
weaknesses
of
her
energetic
nature
was
to
believe
herself
stricken
by
misfortune
hitherto
so
she
asserted
nothing
had
been
successful
with
either
herself
or
her
father
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
goaded
by
her
southern
superstition
she
prepared
to
struggle
with
fate
as
one
struggles
with
somebody
who
is
endeavouring
to
strangle
one
circumstances
soon
justified
her
apprehensions
in
a
singular
manner
returned
inexorably
every
year
some
fresh
disaster
shook
rougon
s
business
a
bankruptcy
resulted
in
the
loss
of
a
few
thousand
francs
his
estimates
of
crops
proved
incorrect
through
the
most
incredible
circumstances
the
safest
speculations
collapsed
miserably
it
was
a
truceless
merciless
combat
you
see
i
was
born
under
an
unlucky
star
felicite
would
bitterly
exclaim
and
yet
she
still
struggled
furiously
not
understanding
how
it
was
that
she
who
had
shown
such
keen
scent
in
a
first
speculation
could
now
only
give
her
husband
the
most
deplorable
advice
pierre
dejected
and
less
tenacious
than
herself
would
have
gone
into
liquidation
a
score
of
times
had
it
not
been
for
his
wife
s
firm
obstinacy
she
longed
to
be
rich
she
perceived
that
her
ambition
could
only
be
attained
by
fortune
as
soon
as
they
possessed
a
few
hundred
thousand
francs
they
would
be
masters
of
the
town
she
would
get
her
husband
appointed
to
an
important
post
and
she
would
govern
it
was
not
the
attainment
of
honours
which
troubled
her
she
felt
herself
marvellously
well
armed
for
such
a
combat
but
she
could
do
nothing
to
get
together
the
first
few
bags
of
money
which
were
needed
though
the
ruling
of
men
caused
her
no
apprehensions
she
felt
a
sort
of
impotent
rage
at
the
thought
of
those
inert
white
cold
pieces
over
which
her
intriguing
spirit
had
no
power
and
which
obstinately
resisted
her
the
battle
lasted
for
more
than
thirty
years
the
death
of
puech
proved
another
heavy
blow
felicite
who
had
counted
upon
an
inheritance
of
about
forty
thousand
francs
found
that
the
selfish
old
man
in
order
to
indulge
himself
in
his
old
age
had
sunk
all
his
money
in
a
life
annuity
the
discovery
made
her
quite
she
was
gradually
becoming
soured
she
was
growing
more
lean
and
harsh
to
see
her
from
morning
till
night
whirling
round
the
jars
of
oil
one
would
have
thought
she
believed
that
she
could
stimulate
the
sales
by
continually
flitting
about
like
a
restless
fly
her
husband
on
the
contrary
became
heavier
misfortune
fattened
him
making
him
duller
and
more
indolent
these
thirty
years
of
combat
did
not
however
bring
him
to
ruin
at
each
annual
they
managed
to
make
both
ends
meet
fairly
well
if
they
suffered
any
loss
during
one
season
they
recouped
themselves
the
next
however
it
was
precisely
this
living
from
hand
to
mouth
which
exasperated
felicite
she
would
by
far
have
preferred
a
big
failure
they
would
then
perhaps
have
been
able
to
commence
life
over
again
instead
of
obstinately
persisting
in
their
petty
business
working
themselves
to
death
to
gain
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
during
one
third
of
a
century
they
did
not
save
fifty
thousand
francs
it
should
be
mentioned
that
from
the
very
first
years
of
their
married
life
they
had
a
numerous
family
which
in
the
long
run
became
a
heavy
burden
to
them
in
the
course
of
five
years
from
to
felicite
gave
birth
to
three
boys
then
during
the
four
ensuing
years
she
presented
her
husband
with
two
girls
these
had
but
an
indifferent
welcome
daughters
are
a
terrible
embarrassment
when
one
has
no
dowry
to
give
them
however
the
young
woman
did
not
regard
this
troop
of
children
as
the
cause
of
their
ruin
on
the
contrary
she
based
on
her
sons
heads
the
building
of
the
fortune
which
was
crumbling
in
her
own
hands
they
were
hardly
ten
years
old
before
she
discounted
their
future
careers
in
her
dreams
doubting
whether
she
would
ever
succeed
herself
she
centred
in
them
all
her
hopes
of
overcoming
the
animosity
of
fate
they
would
provide
satisfaction
for
her
disappointed
vanity
they
would
give
her
that
wealthy
honourable
position
which
she
had
hitherto
sought
in
vain
from
that
time
forward
without
abandoning
the
business
struggle
she
conceived
a
second
plan
for
obtaining
the
gratification
of
her
domineering
instincts
it
seemed
to
her
impossible
that
amongst
her
three
sons
there
should
not
be
a
man
of
superior
intellect
who
would
enrich
them
all
she
felt
it
she
said
accordingly
she
nursed
the
children
with
a
fervour
in
which
maternal
severity
was
blended
with
an
usurer
s
solicitude
she
amused
herself
by
fattening
them
as
though
they
constituted
a
capital
which
later
on
would
return
a
large
interest
enough
pierre
would
sometimes
exclaim
all
children
are
ungrateful
you
are
spoiling
them
you
are
ruining
when
felicite
spoke
of
sending
them
to
college
he
got
angry
latin
was
a
useless
luxury
it
would
be
quite
sufficient
if
they
went
through
the
classes
of
a
little
neighbouring
school
the
young
woman
however
persisted
in
her
design
she
possessed
certain
elevated
instincts
which
made
her
take
a
great
pride
in
surrounding
herself
with
accomplished
children
moreover
she
felt
that
her
sons
must
never
remain
as
illiterate
as
her
husband
if
she
wished
to
see
them
become
prominent
men
she
fancied
them
all
three
in
paris
in
high
positions
which
she
did
not
clearly
define
when
rougon
consented
and
the
three
youngsters
had
entered
the
eighth
class
felicite
felt
the
most
lively
satisfaction
she
had
ever
experienced
she
listened
with
delight
as
they
talked
of
their
professors
and
their
studies
when
she
heard
her
eldest
son
make
one
of
his
brothers
decline
a
it
sounded
like
delicious
music
to
her
it
is
only
fair
to
add
that
her
delight
was
not
tarnished
by
any
sordid
calculations
even
rougon
felt
the
satisfaction
which
an
illiterate
man
experiences
on
perceiving
his
sons
grow
more
learned
than
himself
then
the
fellowship
which
grew
up
between
their
sons
and
those
of
the
local
completed
the
parents
gratification
the
youngsters
were
soon
on
familiar
terms
with
the
sons
of
the
mayor
and
the
and
even
with
two
or
three
young
noblemen
whom
the
quarter
had
deigned
to
send
to
the
plassans
college
felicite
was
at
a
loss
how
to
repay
such
an
honour
the
education
of
the
three
lads
weighed
seriously
on
the
budget
of
the
rougon
household
until
the
boys
had
taken
their
degrees
their
parents
who
kept
them
at
college
at
enormous
sacrifices
lived
in
hopes
of
their
success
when
they
had
obtained
their
diplomas
felicite
wished
to
continue
her
work
and
even
persuaded
her
husband
to
send
the
three
to
paris
two
of
them
devoted
themselves
to
the
study
of
law
and
the
third
passed
through
the
school
of
medicine
then
when
they
were
men
and
had
exhausted
the
resources
of
the
rougon
family
and
were
obliged
to
return
and
establish
themselves
in
the
provinces
their
parents
disenchantment
began
they
idled
about
and
grew
fat
and
felicite
again
felt
all
the
bitterness
of
her
her
sons
were
failing
her
they
had
ruined
her
and
did
not
return
any
interest
on
the
capital
which
they
represented
this
last
blow
of
fate
was
the
heaviest
as
it
fell
on
her
ambition
and
her
maternal
vanity
alike
rougon
repeated
to
her
from
morning
till
night
i
told
you
so
which
only
exasperated
her
the
more
one
day
as
she
was
bitterly
reproaching
her
eldest
son
with
the
large
amount
of
money
expended
on
his
education
he
said
to
her
with
equal
bitterness
i
will
repay
you
later
on
if
i
can
but
as
you
had
no
means
you
should
have
brought
us
up
to
a
trade
we
are
out
of
our
element
we
are
suffering
more
than
felicite
understood
the
wisdom
of
these
words
from
that
time
she
ceased
to
accuse
her
children
and
turned
her
anger
against
fate
which
never
wearied
of
striking
her
she
started
her
old
complaints
afresh
and
bemoaned
more
and
more
the
want
of
means
which
made
her
strand
as
it
were
in
port
whenever
rougon
said
to
her
your
sons
are
lazy
fellows
they
will
eat
up
all
we
have
she
sourly
replied
would
to
god
i
had
more
money
to
give
them
if
they
do
vegetate
poor
fellows
it
s
because
they
haven
t
got
a
sou
to
bless
themselves
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
on
the
eve
of
the
revolution
of
february
the
three
young
rougons
held
very
precarious
positions
at
plassans
they
presented
most
curious
and
profoundly
dissimilar
characteristics
though
they
came
of
the
same
stock
they
were
in
reality
superior
to
their
parents
the
race
of
the
rougons
was
destined
to
become
refined
through
its
female
side
adelaide
had
made
pierre
a
man
of
moderate
enterprise
disposed
to
low
ambitions
felicite
had
inspired
her
sons
with
a
higher
intelligence
with
a
capacity
for
greater
vices
and
greater
virtues
at
the
period
now
referred
to
the
eldest
eugene
was
nearly
forty
years
old
he
was
a
man
of
middle
height
slightly
bald
and
already
disposed
to
obesity
he
had
his
father
s
face
a
long
face
with
broad
features
beneath
his
skin
one
could
divine
the
fat
to
which
were
due
the
flabby
roundness
of
his
features
and
his
yellowish
waxy
complexion
though
his
massive
square
head
still
recalled
the
peasant
his
physiognomy
was
transfigured
lit
up
from
within
as
it
were
when
his
drooping
eyelids
were
raised
and
his
eyes
awoke
to
life
in
the
son
s
case
the
father
s
ponderousness
had
turned
to
gravity
this
big
fellow
eugene
usually
preserved
a
heavy
somnolent
demeanour
at
the
same
time
certain
of
his
heavy
languid
movements
suggested
those
of
a
giant
stretching
his
limbs
pending
the
time
for
action
by
one
of
those
alleged
freaks
of
nature
of
which
however
science
is
now
commencing
to
discover
the
laws
if
physical
resemblance
to
pierre
was
perfect
in
eugene
felicite
on
her
side
seemed
to
have
furnished
him
with
his
brains
he
offered
an
instance
of
certain
moral
and
intellectual
qualities
of
maternal
origin
being
embedded
in
the
coarse
flesh
he
had
derived
from
his
father
he
cherished
lofty
ambitions
possessed
domineering
instincts
and
showed
singular
contempt
for
trifling
expedients
and
petty
fortunes
he
was
a
proof
that
plassans
was
perhaps
not
mistaken
in
suspecting
that
felicite
had
some
blue
blood
in
her
veins
the
passion
for
indulgence
which
became
formidably
developed
in
the
rougons
and
was
in
fact
the
family
characteristic
attained
in
his
case
its
highest
pitch
he
longed
for
but
in
the
form
of
mental
enjoyment
such
as
would
gratify
his
burning
desire
for
domination
a
man
such
as
this
was
never
intended
to
succeed
in
a
provincial
town
he
vegetated
there
for
fifteen
years
his
eyes
turned
towards
paris
watching
his
opportunities
on
his
return
home
he
had
entered
his
name
on
the
rolls
in
order
to
be
independent
of
his
parents
after
that
he
pleaded
from
time
to
time
earning
a
bare
livelihood
without
appearing
to
rise
above
average
mediocrity
at
plassans
his
voice
was
considered
thick
his
movements
heavy
he
generally
wandered
from
the
question
at
issue
rambled
as
the
wiseacres
expressed
it
on
one
occasion
particularly
when
he
was
pleading
in
a
case
for
damages
he
so
forgot
himself
as
to
stray
into
a
political
disquisition
to
such
a
point
that
the
presiding
judge
interfered
whereupon
he
immediately
sat
down
with
a
strange
smile
his
client
was
condemned
to
pay
a
considerable
sum
of
money
a
circumstance
which
did
not
however
seem
to
cause
eugene
the
least
regret
for
his
irrelevant
digression
he
appeared
to
regard
his
speeches
as
mere
exercises
which
would
be
of
use
to
him
later
on
it
was
this
that
puzzled
and
disheartened
felicite
she
would
have
liked
to
see
her
son
dictating
the
law
to
the
civil
court
of
plassans
at
last
she
came
to
entertain
a
very
unfavourable
opinion
of
her
to
her
mind
this
lazy
fellow
would
never
be
the
one
to
shed
any
lustre
on
the
family
pierre
on
the
contrary
felt
absolute
confidence
in
him
not
that
he
had
more
intuition
than
his
wife
but
because
external
appearances
sufficed
him
and
he
flattered
himself
by
believing
in
the
genius
of
a
son
who
was
his
living
image
a
month
prior
to
the
revolution
of
february
eugene
became
restless
some
special
inspiration
made
him
anticipate
the
crisis
from
that
time
forward
he
seemed
to
feel
out
of
his
element
at
plassans
he
would
wander
about
the
streets
like
a
distressed
soul
at
last
he
formed
a
sudden
resolution
and
left
for
paris
with
scarcely
five
hundred
francs
in
his
pocket
aristide
the
youngest
son
was
so
to
speak
diametrically
opposed
to
eugene
he
had
his
mother
s
face
and
a
covetousness
and
slyness
of
character
prone
to
trivial
intrigues
in
which
his
father
s
instincts
predominated
nature
has
need
of
symmetry
short
with
a
pitiful
countenance
suggesting
the
knob
of
a
stick
carved
into
a
punch
s
head
aristide
ferretted
and
fumbled
everywhere
without
any
scruples
eager
only
to
gratify
himself
he
loved
money
as
his
eldest
brother
loved
power
while
eugene
dreamed
of
bending
a
people
to
his
will
and
intoxicated
himself
with
visions
of
future
omnipotence
the
other
fancied
himself
ten
times
a
millionaire
installed
in
a
princely
mansion
eating
and
drinking
to
his
heart
s
content
and
enjoying
life
to
the
fullest
possible
extent
above
all
things
he
longed
to
make
a
rapid
fortune
when
he
was
building
his
castles
in
the
air
they
would
rise
in
his
mind
as
if
by
magic
he
would
become
possessed
of
tons
of
gold
in
one
night
these
visions
agreed
with
his
indolence
as
he
never
troubled
himself
about
the
means
considering
those
the
best
which
were
the
most
expeditious
in
his
case
the
race
of
the
rougons
of
those
coarse
greedy
peasants
with
brutish
appetites
had
matured
too
rapidly
every
desire
for
material
indulgence
was
found
in
him
augmented
threefold
by
hasty
education
and
rendered
the
more
insatiable
and
dangerous
by
the
deliberate
way
in
which
the
young
man
had
come
to
regard
their
realisation
as
his
set
purpose
in
spite
of
her
keen
feminine
intuition
felicite
preferred
this
son
she
did
not
perceive
the
greater
affinity
between
herself
and
eugene
she
excused
the
follies
and
indolence
of
her
youngest
son
under
the
pretext
that
he
would
some
day
be
the
superior
genius
of
the
family
and
that
such
a
man
was
entitled
to
live
a
disorderly
life
until
his
intellectual
strength
should
be
revealed
aristide
subjected
her
indulgence
to
a
rude
test
in
paris
he
led
a
low
idle
life
he
was
one
of
those
students
who
enter
their
names
at
the
taverns
of
the
quartier
latin
he
did
not
remain
there
however
more
than
two
years
his
father
growing
apprehensive
and
seeing
that
he
had
not
yet
passed
a
single
examination
kept
him
at
plassans
and
spoke
of
finding
a
wife
for
him
hoping
that
domestic
responsibility
would
make
him
more
steady
aristide
let
himself
be
married
he
had
no
very
clear
idea
of
his
own
ambitions
at
this
time
provincial
life
did
not
displease
him
he
was
battening
in
his
little
town
eating
sleeping
and
sauntering
about
felicite
pleaded
his
cause
so
earnestly
that
pierre
consented
to
board
and
lodge
the
couple
on
condition
that
the
young
man
should
turn
his
attention
to
the
business
from
that
time
however
aristide
led
a
life
of
ease
and
idleness
he
spent
his
days
and
the
best
part
of
his
nights
at
the
club
again
and
again
slipping
out
of
his
father
s
office
like
a
schoolboy
to
go
and
gamble
away
the
few
louis
that
his
mother
gave
him
clandestinely
it
is
necessary
to
have
lived
in
the
depths
of
the
french
provinces
to
form
an
idea
of
the
four
brutifying
years
which
the
young
fellow
spent
in
this
fashion
in
every
little
town
there
is
a
group
of
individuals
who
thus
live
on
their
parents
pretending
at
times
to
work
but
in
reality
cultivating
idleness
with
a
sort
of
religious
zeal
aristide
was
typical
of
these
incorrigible
drones
for
four
years
he
did
little
but
play
ecarte
while
he
passed
his
time
at
the
club
his
wife
a
nerveless
woman
helped
to
ruin
the
rougon
business
by
her
inordinate
passion
for
showy
gowns
and
her
formidable
appetite
a
rather
remarkable
peculiarity
in
so
frail
a
creature
angele
however
adored
ribbons
and
roast
beef
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
retired
captain
who
was
called
commander
sicardot
a
old
gentleman
who
had
given
her
a
dowry
of
ten
thousand
francs
all
his
savings
pierre
in
selecting
angele
for
his
son
had
considered
that
he
had
made
an
unexpected
bargain
so
lightly
did
he
esteem
aristide
however
that
dowry
of
ten
thousand
francs
which
determined
his
choice
ultimately
became
a
millstone
round
his
neck
his
son
who
was
already
a
cunning
rogue
deposited
the
ten
thousand
francs
with
his
father
with
whom
he
entered
into
partnership
declining
with
the
most
sincere
professions
of
devotion
to
keep
a
single
copper
we
have
no
need
of
anything
he
said
you
will
keep
my
wife
and
myself
and
we
will
reckon
up
later
pierre
was
short
of
money
at
the
time
and
accepted
not
however
without
some
uneasiness
at
aristide
s
disinterestedness
the
latter
calculated
that
it
would
be
years
before
his
father
would
have
ten
thousand
francs
in
ready
money
to
repay
him
so
that
he
and
his
wife
would
live
at
the
paternal
expense
so
long
as
the
partnership
could
not
be
dissolved
it
was
an
admirable
investment
for
his
few
when
the
understood
what
a
foolish
bargain
he
had
made
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
rid
himself
of
aristide
angele
s
dowry
was
involved
in
speculations
which
were
turning
out
unfavourably
he
was
exasperated
stung
to
the
heart
at
having
to
provide
for
his
s
voracious
appetite
and
keep
his
son
in
idleness
had
he
been
able
to
buy
them
out
of
the
business
he
would
twenty
times
have
shut
his
doors
on
those
bloodsuckers
as
he
emphatically
expressed
it
felicite
secretly
defended
them
the
young
man
who
had
divined
her
dreams
of
ambition
would
every
evening
describe
to
her
the
elaborate
plans
by
which
he
would
shortly
make
a
fortune
by
a
rare
chance
she
had
remained
on
excellent
terms
with
her
it
must
be
confessed
that
angele
had
no
will
of
her
own
she
could
be
moved
and
disposed
of
like
a
piece
of
furniture
meantime
pierre
became
enraged
whenever
his
wife
spoke
to
him
of
the
success
their
youngest
son
would
ultimately
achieve
he
declared
that
he
would
really
bring
them
to
ruin
during
the
four
years
that
the
young
couple
lived
with
him
he
stormed
in
this
manner
wasting
his
impotent
rage
in
quarrels
without
in
the
least
disturbing
the
equanimity
of
aristide
and
angele
they
were
located
there
and
there
they
intended
to
remain
like
blocks
of
wood
at
last
pierre
met
with
a
stroke
of
luck
which
enabled
him
to
return
the
ten
thousand
francs
to
his
son
when
however
he
wanted
to
reckon
up
accounts
with
him
aristide
interposed
so
much
chicanery
that
he
had
to
let
the
couple
go
without
deducting
a
copper
for
their
board
and
lodging
they
installed
themselves
but
a
short
distance
off
in
a
part
of
the
old
quarter
called
the
place
the
ten
thousand
francs
were
soon
consumed
they
had
everything
to
get
for
their
new
home
moreover
aristide
made
no
change
in
his
mode
of
living
as
long
as
any
money
was
left
in
the
house
when
he
had
reached
the
last
note
he
felt
rather
nervous
he
was
seen
prowling
about
the
town
in
a
suspicious
manner
he
no
longer
took
his
customary
cup
of
coffee
at
the
club
he
watched
feverishly
whilst
play
was
going
on
without
touching
a
card
poverty
made
him
more
spiteful
than
he
would
otherwise
have
been
he
bore
the
blow
for
a
long
time
obstinately
refusing
to
do
anything
in
the
way
of
work
in
he
had
a
son
little
maxime
whom
his
grandmother
felicite
fortunately
sent
to
college
paying
his
fees
clandestinely
that
made
one
mouth
less
at
home
but
poor
angele
was
dying
of
hunger
and
her
husband
was
at
last
compelled
to
seek
a
situation
he
secured
one
at
the
he
remained
there
nearly
ten
years
and
only
attained
a
salary
of
eighteen
hundred
francs
per
annum
from
that
time
forward
it
was
with
ever
increasing
malevolence
and
rancour
that
he
hungered
for
the
enjoyments
of
which
he
was
deprived
his
lowly
position
exasperated
him
the
paltry
hundred
and
fifty
francs
which
he
received
every
month
seemed
to
him
an
irony
of
fate
never
did
man
burn
with
such
desire
for
felicite
to
whom
he
imparted
his
sufferings
was
by
no
means
grieved
to
see
him
so
eager
she
thought
his
misery
would
stimulate
his
energies
at
last
crouching
in
ambush
as
it
were
with
his
ears
wide
open
he
began
to
look
about
him
like
a
thief
seeking
his
opportunity
at
the
beginning
of
when
his
brother
left
for
paris
he
had
a
momentary
idea
of
following
him
but
eugene
was
a
bachelor
and
he
aristide
could
not
take
his
wife
so
far
without
money
so
he
waited
scenting
a
catastrophe
and
ready
to
fall
on
the
first
prey
that
might
come
within
his
reach
the
other
son
pascal
born
between
eugene
and
aristide
did
not
appear
to
belong
to
the
family
he
was
one
of
those
frequent
cases
which
give
the
lie
to
the
laws
of
heredity
during
the
evolution
of
a
race
nature
often
produces
some
one
being
whose
every
element
she
derives
from
her
own
creative
powers
nothing
in
the
moral
or
physical
constitution
of
pascal
recalled
the
rougons
tall
with
a
grave
and
gentle
face
he
had
an
uprightness
of
mind
a
love
of
study
a
retiring
modesty
which
contrasted
strangely
with
the
feverish
ambitions
and
unscrupulous
intrigues
of
his
relatives
after
acquitting
himself
admirably
of
his
medical
studies
in
paris
he
had
retired
by
preference
to
plassans
notwithstanding
the
offers
he
received
from
his
professors
he
loved
a
quiet
provincial
life
he
maintained
that
for
a
studious
man
such
a
life
was
preferable
to
the
excitement
of
paris
even
at
plassans
he
did
not
exert
himself
to
extend
his
practice
very
steady
and
despising
fortune
he
contented
himself
with
the
few
patients
sent
him
by
chance
all
his
pleasures
were
centred
in
a
bright
little
house
in
the
new
town
where
he
shut
himself
up
lovingly
devoting
his
whole
time
to
the
study
of
natural
history
he
was
particularly
fond
of
physiology
it
was
known
in
the
town
that
he
frequently
purchased
dead
bodies
from
the
hospital
a
circumstance
which
rendered
him
an
object
of
horror
to
delicate
ladies
and
certain
timid
gentlemen
fortunately
they
did
not
actually
look
upon
him
as
a
sorcerer
but
his
practice
diminished
and
he
was
regarded
as
an
eccentric
character
to
whom
people
of
good
society
ought
not
to
entrust
even
a
for
fear
of
being
compromised
the
mayor
s
wife
was
one
day
heard
to
say
i
would
sooner
die
than
be
attended
by
that
gentleman
he
smells
of
from
that
time
pascal
was
condemned
he
seemed
to
rejoice
at
the
mute
terror
which
he
inspired
the
fewer
patients
he
had
the
more
time
he
could
devote
to
his
favourite
sciences
as
his
fees
were
very
moderate
the
poorer
people
remained
faithful
to
him
he
earned
just
enough
to
live
and
lived
contentedly
a
thousand
leagues
away
from
the
rest
of
the
country
absorbed
in
the
pure
delight
of
his
researches
and
discoveries
from
time
to
time
he
sent
a
memoir
to
the
academie
des
sciences
at
paris
plassans
did
not
know
that
this
eccentric
character
this
gentleman
who
smelt
of
death
was
and
in
the
world
of
science
when
people
saw
him
starting
on
sundays
for
an
excursion
among
the
garrigues
hills
with
a
botanist
s
bag
hung
round
his
neck
and
a
geologist
s
hammer
in
his
hand
they
would
shrug
their
shoulders
and
institute
a
comparison
between
him
and
some
other
doctor
of
the
town
who
was
noted
for
his
smart
cravat
his
affability
to
the
ladies
and
the
delicious
odour
of
violets
which
his
garments
always
diffused
pascal
s
parents
did
not
understand
him
any
better
than
other
people
when
felicite
saw
him
adopting
such
a
strange
unpretentious
mode
of
life
she
was
stupefied
and
reproached
him
for
disappointing
her
hopes
she
who
tolerated
aristide
s
idleness
because
she
thought
it
would
prove
fertile
could
not
view
without
regret
the
slow
progress
of
pascal
his
partiality
for
obscurity
and
contempt
for
riches
his
determined
resolve
to
lead
a
life
of
retirement
he
was
certainly
not
the
child
who
would
ever
gratify
her
vanities
but
where
do
you
spring
from
she
would
sometimes
say
to
him
you
are
not
one
of
us
look
at
your
brothers
how
they
keep
their
eyes
open
striving
to
profit
by
the
education
we
have
given
them
whilst
you
waste
your
time
on
follies
and
trifles
you
make
a
very
poor
return
to
us
who
have
ruined
ourselves
for
your
education
no
you
are
certainly
not
one
of
pascal
who
preferred
to
laugh
whenever
he
was
called
upon
to
feel
annoyed
replied
cheerfully
but
not
without
a
sting
of
irony
oh
you
need
not
be
frightened
i
shall
never
drive
you
to
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
when
any
of
you
are
ill
i
will
attend
you
for
moreover
though
he
never
displayed
any
repugnance
to
his
relatives
he
very
rarely
saw
them
following
in
this
wise
his
natural
instincts
before
aristide
obtained
a
situation
at
the
pascal
had
frequently
come
to
his
assistance
for
his
part
he
had
remained
a
bachelor
he
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
the
grave
events
that
were
preparing
for
two
or
three
years
he
had
been
studying
the
great
problem
of
heredity
comparing
the
human
and
animal
races
together
and
becoming
absorbed
in
the
strange
results
which
he
obtained
certain
observations
which
he
had
made
with
respect
to
himself
and
his
relatives
had
been
so
to
say
the
of
his
studies
the
common
people
with
their
natural
intuition
so
well
understood
that
he
was
quite
different
from
the
other
rougons
that
they
invariably
called
him
monsieur
pascal
without
ever
adding
his
family
name
three
years
prior
to
the
revolution
of
pierre
and
felicite
retired
from
business
old
age
was
coming
on
apace
they
were
both
past
fifty
and
were
weary
enough
of
the
struggle
in
face
of
their
ill
fortune
they
were
afraid
of
being
ultimately
ruined
if
they
obstinately
persisted
in
the
fight
their
sons
by
disappointing
their
expectations
had
dealt
them
the
final
blow
now
that
they
despaired
of
ever
being
enriched
by
them
they
were
anxious
to
make
some
little
provision
for
old
age
they
retired
with
forty
thousand
francs
at
the
utmost
this
sum
provided
an
annual
income
of
two
thousand
francs
just
sufficient
to
live
in
a
small
way
in
the
provinces
fortunately
they
were
by
themselves
having
succeeded
in
marrying
their
daughters
marthe
and
sidonie
the
former
of
whom
resided
at
marseilles
and
the
latter
in
paris
after
they
had
settled
their
affairs
they
would
much
have
liked
to
take
up
their
abode
in
the
new
town
the
quarter
of
the
retired
traders
but
they
dared
not
do
so
their
income
was
too
small
they
were
afraid
that
they
would
cut
but
a
poor
figure
there
so
as
a
sort
of
compromise
they
took
apartments
in
the
rue
de
la
banne
the
street
which
separates
the
old
quarter
from
the
new
one
as
their
abode
was
one
of
the
row
of
houses
bordering
the
old
quarter
they
still
lived
among
the
common
people
nevertheless
they
could
see
the
town
of
the
richer
classes
from
their
windows
so
that
they
were
just
on
the
threshold
of
the
promised
land
their
apartments
situated
on
the
second
floor
consisted
of
three
large
rooms
and
bedroom
the
first
floor
was
occupied
by
the
owner
of
the
house
a
stick
and
umbrella
manufacturer
who
had
a
shop
on
the
ground
floor
the
house
which
was
narrow
and
by
no
means
deep
had
only
two
storeys
felicite
moved
into
it
with
a
bitter
pang
in
the
provinces
to
live
in
another
person
s
house
is
an
avowal
of
poverty
every
family
of
position
at
plassans
has
a
house
of
its
own
landed
property
being
very
cheap
there
pierre
kept
the
well
tied
he
would
not
hear
of
any
embellishments
the
old
furniture
faded
worn
damaged
though
it
was
had
to
suffice
without
even
being
repaired
felicite
however
who
keenly
felt
the
necessity
for
this
parsimony
exerted
herself
to
give
fresh
polish
to
all
the
wreckage
she
herself
knocked
nails
into
some
of
the
furniture
which
was
more
dilapidated
than
the
rest
and
darned
the
frayed
velvet
of
the
the
which
like
the
kitchen
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
was
nearly
bare
a
table
and
a
dozen
chairs
were
lost
in
the
gloom
of
this
large
apartment
whose
window
faced
the
grey
wall
of
a
neighbouring
building
as
no
strangers
ever
went
into
the
bedroom
felicite
had
stowed
all
her
useless
furniture
there
thus
besides
a
bedstead
wardrobe
secretaire
and
it
contained
two
cradles
one
perched
atop
of
the
other
a
sideboard
whose
doors
were
missing
and
an
empty
bookcase
venerable
ruins
which
the
old
woman
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
part
with
all
her
cares
however
were
bestowed
upon
the
and
she
almost
succeeded
in
making
it
comfortable
and
decent
the
furniture
was
covered
with
yellowish
velvet
with
satin
flowers
in
the
middle
stood
a
round
table
with
a
marble
top
while
a
couple
of
pier
tables
surmounted
by
mirrors
leant
against
the
walls
at
either
end
of
the
room
there
was
even
a
carpet
which
just
covered
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
a
chandelier
in
a
white
muslin
cover
which
the
flies
had
spotted
with
black
specks
on
the
walls
hung
six
lithographs
representing
the
great
battles
of
napoleon
i
moreover
the
furniture
dated
from
the
first
years
of
the
empire
the
only
embellishment
that
felicite
could
obtain
was
to
have
the
walls
hung
with
paper
covered
with
large
flowers
thus
the
drawing
room
had
a
strange
yellow
glow
which
filled
it
with
an
artificial
dazzling
light
the
furniture
the
paper
and
the
window
curtains
were
yellow
the
carpet
and
even
the
marble
showed
touches
of
yellow
however
when
the
curtains
were
drawn
the
colours
harmonised
fairly
well
and
the
looked
almost
decent
but
felicite
had
dreamed
of
quite
a
different
kind
of
luxury
she
regarded
with
mute
despair
this
misery
she
usually
occupied
the
the
best
apartment
in
the
house
and
the
sweetest
and
bitterest
of
her
pastimes
was
to
sit
at
one
of
the
windows
which
overlooked
the
rue
de
la
banne
and
gave
her
a
side
view
of
the
square
in
front
of
the
that
was
the
paradise
of
her
dreams
that
little
neat
tidy
square
with
its
bright
houses
seemed
to
her
a
garden
of
eden
she
would
have
given
ten
years
of
her
life
to
possess
one
of
those
habitations
the
house
at
the
corner
in
which
the
receiver
of
taxes
resided
particularly
tempted
her
she
contemplated
it
with
eager
longing
sometimes
when
the
windows
of
this
abode
were
open
she
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
rich
furniture
and
tasteful
elegance
which
made
her
burn
with
envy
at
this
period
the
rougons
passed
through
a
curious
crisis
of
vanity
and
unsatiated
appetite
the
few
proper
feelings
which
they
had
once
entertained
had
become
embittered
they
posed
as
victims
of
evil
fortune
not
with
resignation
however
for
they
seemed
still
more
keenly
determined
that
they
would
not
die
before
they
had
satisfied
their
ambitions
in
reality
they
did
not
abandon
any
of
their
hopes
notwithstanding
their
advanced
age
felicite
professed
to
feel
a
presentiment
that
she
would
die
rich
however
each
day
of
poverty
weighed
them
down
the
more
when
they
recapitulated
their
vain
attempts
when
they
recalled
their
thirty
years
struggle
and
the
defection
of
their
children
when
they
saw
their
airy
castles
end
in
this
yellow
whose
shabbiness
they
could
only
conceal
by
drawing
the
curtains
they
were
overcome
with
bitter
rage
then
as
a
consolation
they
would
think
of
plans
for
making
a
colossal
fortune
seeking
all
sorts
of
devices
felicite
would
fancy
herself
the
winner
of
the
grand
prize
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
some
lottery
while
pierre
pictured
himself
carrying
out
some
wonderful
speculation
they
lived
with
one
sole
thought
that
of
making
a
fortune
immediately
in
a
few
hours
of
becoming
rich
and
enjoying
themselves
if
only
for
a
year
their
whole
beings
tended
to
this
stubbornly
without
a
pause
and
they
still
cherished
some
faint
hopes
with
regard
to
their
sons
with
that
peculiar
egotism
of
parents
who
can
not
bear
to
think
that
they
have
sent
their
children
to
college
without
deriving
some
personal
advantage
from
it
felicite
did
not
appear
to
have
aged
she
was
still
the
same
dark
little
woman
ever
on
the
move
buzzing
about
like
a
grasshopper
any
person
walking
behind
her
on
the
pavement
would
have
thought
her
a
girl
of
fifteen
from
the
lightness
of
her
step
and
the
angularity
of
her
shoulders
and
waist
even
her
face
had
scarcely
undergone
any
change
it
was
simply
rather
more
sunken
rather
more
suggestive
of
the
snout
of
a
as
for
pierre
rougon
he
had
grown
corpulent
and
had
become
a
highly
respectable
looking
citizen
who
only
lacked
a
decent
income
to
make
him
a
very
dignified
individual
his
pale
flabby
face
his
heaviness
his
languid
manner
seemed
redolent
of
wealth
he
had
one
day
heard
a
peasant
who
did
not
know
him
say
ah
he
s
some
rich
fellow
that
fat
old
gentleman
there
he
s
no
cause
to
worry
about
his
dinner
this
was
a
remark
which
stung
him
to
the
heart
for
he
considered
it
cruel
mockery
to
be
only
a
poor
devil
while
possessing
the
bulk
and
contented
gravity
of
a
millionaire
when
he
shaved
on
sundays
in
front
of
a
small
hanging
from
the
fastening
of
a
window
he
would
often
think
that
in
a
dress
coat
and
white
tie
he
would
cut
a
far
better
figure
at
the
s
than
such
or
such
a
functionary
of
plassans
this
peasant
s
son
who
had
grown
sallow
from
business
worries
and
corpulent
from
a
sedentary
life
whose
hateful
passions
were
hidden
beneath
naturally
placid
features
really
had
that
air
of
solemn
imbecility
which
gives
a
man
a
position
in
an
official
salon
people
imagined
that
his
wife
held
a
rod
over
him
but
they
were
mistaken
he
was
as
as
a
brute
any
determined
expression
of
extraneous
will
would
drive
him
into
a
violent
rage
felicite
was
far
too
supple
to
thwart
him
openly
with
her
light
fluttering
nature
she
did
not
attack
obstacles
in
front
when
she
wished
to
obtain
something
from
her
husband
or
drive
him
the
way
she
thought
best
she
would
buzz
round
him
in
her
grasshopper
fashion
stinging
him
on
all
sides
and
returning
to
the
charge
a
hundred
times
until
he
yielded
almost
unconsciously
he
felt
moreover
that
she
was
shrewder
than
he
and
tolerated
her
advice
fairly
patiently
felicite
more
useful
than
the
coach
fly
would
sometimes
do
all
the
work
while
she
was
thus
buzzing
round
pierre
s
ears
strange
to
say
the
husband
and
wife
never
accused
each
other
of
their
the
only
bone
of
contention
between
them
was
the

lavished
on
their
children

by

luck

disposed
to
lay

in

iii
in
that
closed
sequestered
town
of
plassans
where
class
distinction
was
so
clearly
marked
in
the
commotion
caused
by
political
events
was
very
slight
even
at
the
present
day
the
popular
voice
sounds
very
faintly
there
the
middle
classes
bring
their
prudence
to
bear
in

mute
despair

while

fights
but
though
on
the
surface
the
town
may
appear
calm
and
indifferent
in
the
depths
hidden
work
goes
on
which
it
is
curious
to
study
if
shots
are
rare
in
the
streets
intrigues
consume
the
of
both
the
new
town
and
the
quarter
until
the
year
the
masses
were
reckoned
of
no
account
even
at
the
present
time
they
are
similarly
ignored
everything
is
settled
between
the
clergy
the
nobility
and
the
bourgeoisie
the
priests
who
are
very
numerous
give
the
cue
to
the
local
politics
they
lay
subterranean
mines
as
it
were
and
deal
blows
in
the
dark
following
a
prudent
tactical
system
which
hardly
allows
of
a
step
in
advance
or
retreat
even
in
the
course
of
ten
years
the
secret
intrigues
of
men
who
desire
above
all
things
to
avoid
noise
requires
special
shrewdness
a
special
aptitude
for
dealing
with
small
matters
and
a
patient
endurance
such
as
one
only
finds
in
persons
callous
to
all
passions
it
is
thus
that
provincial
dilatoriness
which
is
so
freely
ridiculed
in
paris
is
full
of
treachery

worthy
men

when
their
interests
are
at

kill
at
home
with
a
snap
of
the
fingers
as
we
the
parisians
kill
with
cannon
in
the
public
thoroughfares
the
political
history
of
plassans
like
that
of
all
little
towns
in
provence
is
singularly
characteristic
until
the
inhabitants
remained
observant
catholics
and
fervent
royalists
even
the
lower
classes
only
swore
by
god
and
their
legitimate
sovereigns
then
there
came
a
sudden
change
faith
departed
the
working
and
middle
classes
deserted
the
cause
of
legitimacy
and
gradually
espoused
the
great
democratic
movement
of
our
time
when
the
revolution
of
broke
out
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
were
left
alone
to
labour
for
the
triumph
of
henri
for
a
long
time
they
had
regarded
the
accession
of
the
orleanists
as
a
ridiculous
experiment
which
sooner
or
later
would
bring
back
the
bourbons
although
their
hopes
were
singularly
shaken
they
nevertheless
continued
the
struggle
scandalised
by
the
defection
of
their
former
allies
whom
they
strove
to
win
back
to
their
cause
the
quarter
assisted
by
all
the
parish
priests
set
to
work
among
the
middle
classes
and
especially
among
the
people
the
enthusiasm
was
very
great
on
the
morrow
of
the
events
of
february
these
apprentice
republicans
were
in
haste
to
display
their
revolutionary
fervour
as
regards
the
gentry
of
the
new
town
however
the
conflagration
bright
though
it
was
lasted
no
longer
than
a
fire
of
straw
the
small
houseowners
and
retired
tradespeople
who
had
had
their
good
days
or
had
made
snug
little
fortunes
under
the
monarchy
were
soon
seized
with
panic
the
republic
with
its
constant
shocks
and
convulsions
made
them
tremble
for
their
money
and
their
life
of
selfishness
consequently
when
the
clerical
reaction
of
declared
itself
nearly
all
the
middle
classes
passed
over
to
the
conservative
party
they
were
received
with
open
arms
the
new
town
had
never
before
had
such
close
relations
with
the
quarter
some
of
the
nobility
even
went
so
far
as
to
shake
hands
with
lawyers
and
retired
this
unexpected
familiarity
kindled
the
enthusiasm
of
the
new
quarter
which
henceforward
waged
bitter
warfare
against
the
republican
government
to
bring
about
such
a
coalition
the
clergy
had
to
display
marvellous
skill
and
endurance
the
nobility
of
plassans
for
the
most
part
lay
prostrate
as
if
half
dead
they
retained
their
faith
but
lethargy
had
fallen
on
them
and
they
preferred
to
remain
inactive
allowing
the
heavens
to
work
their
will
they
would
gladly
have
contented
themselves
with
silent
protest
feeling
perhaps
a
vague
presentiment
that
their
divinities
were
dead
and
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
them
to
do
but
rejoin
them
even
at
this
period
of
confusion
when
the
catastrophe
of
was
calculated
to
give
them
a
momentary
hope
of
the
return
of
the
bourbons
they
showed
themselves
spiritless
and
indifferent
speaking
of
rushing
into
the
melee
yet
never
quitting
their
hearths
without
a
pang
of
regret
the
clergy
battled
indefatigably
against
this
feeling
of
impotence
and
resignation
they
infused
a
kind
of
passion
into
their
work
a
priest
when
he
despairs
struggles
all
the
more
fiercely
the
fundamental
policy
of
the
church
is
to
march
straight
forward
even
though
she
may
have
to
postpone
the
accomplishment
of
her
projects
for
several
centuries
she
never
wastes
a
single
hour
but
is
always
pushing
forward
with
increasing
energy
so
it
was
the
clergy
who
led
the
reaction
of
plassans
the
nobility
only
lent
them
their
name
nothing
more
the
priests
hid
themselves
behind
the
nobles
restrained
them
directed
them
and
even
succeeded
in
endowing
them
with
a
semblance
of
life
when
they
had
induced
them
to
overcome
their
repugnance
so
far
as
to
make
common
cause
with
the
middle
classes
they
believed
themselves
certain
of
victory
the
ground
was
marvellously
well
prepared
this
ancient
royalist
town
with
its
population
of
peaceful
householders
and
timorous
tradespeople
was
destined
to
range
itself
sooner
or
later
on
the
side
of
law
and
order
the
clergy
by
their
tactics
hastened
the
conversion
after
gaining
the
landlords
of
the
new
town
to
their
side
they
even
succeeded
in
convincing
the
little
of
the
old
quarter
from
that
time
the
reactionary
movement
obtained
complete
possession
of
the
town
all
opinions
were
represented
in
this
reaction
such
a
mixture
of
embittered
liberals
legitimists
orleanists
bonapartists
and
clericals
had
never
before
been
seen
it
mattered
little
however
at
that
time
the
sole
object
was
to
kill
the
republic
and
the
republic
was
at
the
point
of
death
only
a
fraction
of
the
people
a
thousand
workmen
at
most
out
of
the
ten
thousand
souls
in
the
town
still
saluted
the
tree
of
liberty
planted
in
the
middle
of
the
square
in
front
of
the
the
shrewdest
politicians
of
plassans
those
who
led
the
reactionary
movement
did
not
scent
the
approach
of
the
empire
until
very
much
later
prince
louis
napoleon
s
popularity
seemed
to
them
a
mere
passing
fancy
of
the
multitude
his
person
inspired
them
with
but
little
admiration
they
reckoned
him
a
nonentity
a
dreamer
incapable
of
laying
his
hands
on
france
and
especially
of
maintaining
his
authority
to
them
he
was
only
a
tool
whom
they
would
make
use
of
who
would
clear
the
way
for
them
and
whom
they
would
turn
out
as
soon
as
the
hour
arrived
for
the
rightful
pretender
to
show
himself
however
months
went
by
and
they
became
uneasy
it
was
only
then
that
they
vaguely
perceived
they
were
being
duped
they
had
no
time
however
to
take
any
steps
the
coup
d
etat
burst
over
their
heads
and
they
were
compelled
to
applaud
that
great
abomination
the
republic
had
been
assassinated
that
at
least
was
some
sort
of
triumph
so
the
clergy
and
the
nobility
accepted
accomplished
facts
with
resignation
postponing
until
later
the
realisation
of
their
hopes
and
making
amends
for
their
miscalculations
by
uniting
with
the
bonapartists
for
the
purpose
of
crushing
the
last
republicans
the
count
de
chambord
henri
it
was
these
events
that
laid
the
foundation
of
the
rougons
fortune
after
being
mixed
up
with
the
various
phases
of
the
crisis
they
rose
to
eminence
on
the
ruins
of
liberty
these
bandits
had
been
lying
in
wait
to
rob
the
republic
as
soon
as
it
had
been
strangled
they
helped
to
plunder
it
after
the
events
of
february
felicite
who
had
the
keenest
scent
of
all
the
members
of
the
family
perceived
that
they
were
at
last
on
the
right
track
so
she
began
to
flutter
round
her
husband
goading
him
on
to
bestir
himself
the
first
rumours
of
the
revolution
that
had
overturned
king
louis
philippe
had
terrified
pierre
when
his
wife
however
made
him
understand
that
they
had
little
to
lose
and
much
to
gain
from
a
convulsion
he
soon
came
round
to
her
way
of
thinking
i
don
t
know
what
you
can
do
felicite
repeatedly
said
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
s
plenty
to
be
done
did
not
monsieur
de
carnavant
say
to
us
one
day
that
he
would
be
rich
if
ever
henri
should
return
and
that
this
sovereign
would
magnificently
recompense
those
who
had
worked
for
his
restoration
perhaps
our
fortune
lies
in
that
direction
we
may
yet
be
the
marquis
de
carnavant
the
nobleman
who
according
to
the
scandalous
talk
of
the
town
had
been
on
very
familiar
terms
with
felicite
s
mother
used
occasionally
to
visit
the
rougons
evil
tongues
asserted
that
madame
rougon
resembled
him
he
was
a
little
lean
active
man
years
old
at
that
time
and
felicite
certainly
appeared
to
be
taking
his
features
and
manner
as
she
grew
older
it
was
said
that
the
wreck
of
his
fortune
which
had
already
been
greatly
diminished
by
his
father
at
the
time
of
the
emigration
had
been
squandered
on
women
indeed
he
cheerfully
acknowledged
his
poverty
brought
up
by
one
of
his
relatives
the
count
de
valqueyras
he
lived
the
life
of
a
parasite
eating
at
the
count
s
table
and
occupying
a
small
apartment
just
under
his
roof
little
one
he
would
often
say
to
felicite
as
he
patted
her
on
the
cheek
if
ever
henri
gives
me
a
fortune
i
will
make
you
my
heiress
he
still
called
felicite
little
one
even
when
she
was
fifty
years
old
it
was
of
these
friendly
pats
of
these
repeated
promises
of
an
inheritance
that
madame
rougon
was
thinking
when
she
endeavoured
to
drive
her
husband
into
politics
monsieur
de
carnavant
had
often
bitterly
lamented
his
inability
to
render
her
any
assistance
no
doubt
he
would
treat
her
like
a
father
if
ever
he
should
acquire
some
influence
pierre
to
whom
his
wife
half
explained
the
situation
in
veiled
terms
declared
his
readiness
to
move
in
any
direction
indicated
the
marquis
s
peculiar
position
qualified
him
to
act
as
an
energetic
agent
of
the
reactionary
movement
at
plassans
from
the
first
days
of
the
republic
this
bustling
little
man
who
had
everything
to
gain
from
the
return
of
his
legitimate
sovereigns
worked
assiduously
for
their
cause
while
the
wealthy
nobility
of
the
quarter
were
slumbering
in
mute
despair
fearing
perhaps
that
they
might
compromise
themselves
and
again
be
condemned
to
exile
he
multiplied
himself
as
it
were
spread
the
propaganda
and
rallied
faithful
ones
together
he
was
a
weapon
whose
hilt
was
held
by
an
invisible
hand
from
that
time
forward
he
paid
daily
visits
to
the
rougons
he
required
a
centre
of
operations
his
relative
monsieur
de
valqueyras
had
forbidden
him
to
bring
any
of
his
associates
into
his
house
so
he
had
chosen
felicite
s
yellow
moreover
he
very
soon
found
pierre
a
valuable
assistant
he
could
not
go
himself
and
preach
the
cause
of
legitimacy
to
the
petty
traders
and
workmen
of
the
old
quarter
they
would
have
hooted
him
pierre
on
the
other
hand
who
had
lived
among
these
people
spoke
their
language
and
knew
their
wants
was
able
to
catechise
them
in
a
friendly
way
he
thus
became
an
indispensable
man
in
less
than
a
fortnight
the
rougons
were
more
determined
royalists
than
the
king
himself
the
marquis
perceiving
pierre
s
zeal
shrewdly
sheltered
himself
behind
him
what
was
the
use
of
making
himself
conspicuous
when
a
man
with
such
broad
shoulders
was
willing
to
bear
on
them
the
burden
of
all
the
follies
of
a
party
he
allowed
pierre
to
reign
puff
himself
out
with
importance
and
speak
with
authority
content
to
restrain
or
urge
him
on
according
to
the
necessities
of
the
cause
thus
the
old
soon
became
a
personage
of
mark
in
the
evening
when
they
were
alone
felicite
used
to
say
to
him
go
on
don
t
be
frightened
we
re
on
the
right
track
if
this
continues
we
shall
be
rich
we
shall
have
a
like
the
s
and
be
able
to
entertain
a
little
party
of
conservatives
had
already
been
formed
at
the
rougons
house
and
meetings
were
held
every
evening
in
the
yellow
to
declaim
against
the
republic
among
those
who
came
were
three
or
four
retired
merchants
who
trembled
for
their
money
and
clamoured
with
all
their
might
for
a
wise
and
strong
government
an
old
a
member
of
the
municipal
council
monsieur
isidore
granoux
was
the
head
of
this
group
his
mouth
was
cloven
a
little
way
from
the
nose
his
round
eyes
his
air
of
mingled
satisfaction
and
astonishment
made
him
resemble
a
fat
goose
whose
digestion
is
attended
by
wholesome
terror
of
the
cook
he
spoke
little
having
no
command
of
words
and
he
only
pricked
up
his
ears
when
anyone
accused
the
republicans
of
wishing
to
pillage
the
houses
of
the
rich
whereupon
he
would
colour
up
to
such
a
degree
as
to
make
one
fear
an
approaching
apoplectic
fit
and
mutter
low
imprecations
in
which
the
words
idlers
scoundrels
thieves
and
assassins
frequently
recurred
all
those
who
frequented
the
yellow
were
not
however
as
heavy
as
this
fat
goose
a
rich
landowner
monsieur
roudier
with
a
plump
insinuating
face
used
to
discourse
there
for
hours
altogether
with
all
the
passion
of
an
orleanist
whose
calculations
had
been
upset
by
the
fall
of
louis
philippe
he
had
formerly
been
a
hosier
at
paris
and
a
purveyor
to
the
court
but
had
now
retired
to
plassans
he
had
made
his
son
a
magistrate
relying
on
the
orleanist
party
to
promote
him
to
the
highest
dignities
the
revolution
having
ruined
all
his
hopes
he
had
rushed
wildly
into
the
reaction
his
fortune
his
former
commercial
relations
with
the
tuileries
which
he
transformed
into
friendly
intercourse
that
prestige
which
is
enjoyed
by
every
man
in
the
provinces
who
has
made
his
money
in
paris
and
deigns
to
come
and
spend
it
in
a
far
away
department
gave
him
great
influence
in
the
district
some
persons
listened
to
him
as
though
he
were
an
oracle
however
the
strongest
intellect
of
the
yellow
was
certainly
commander
sicardot
aristide
s
of
herculean
frame
with
a
face
scarred
and
planted
with
tufts
of
grey
hair
he
was
one
of
the
most
glorious
old
dolts
of
the
grande
armee
during
the
february
revolution
he
had
been
exasperated
with
the
street
warfare
and
never
wearied
of
referring
to
it
proclaiming
with
indignation
that
this
kind
of
fighting
was
shameful
whereupon
he
recalled
with
pride
the
grand
reign
of
napoleon
another
person
seen
at
the
rougons
house
was
an
individual
with
clammy
hands
and
equivocal
look
one
monsieur
vuillet
a
bookseller
who
supplied
all
the
devout
ladies
of
the
town
with
holy
images
and
rosaries
vuillet
dealt
in
both
classical
and
religious
works
he
was
a
strict
catholic
a
circumstance
which
insured
him
the
custom
of
the
numerous
convents
and
parish
churches
further
by
a
stroke
of
genius
he
had
added
to
his
business
the
publication
of
a
little
journal
the
gazette
de
plassans
which
was
devoted
exclusively
to
the
interests
of
the
clergy
this
paper
involved
an
annual
loss
of
a
thousand
francs
but
it
made
him
the
champion
of
the
church
and
enabled
him
to
dispose
of
his
sacred
unsaleable
stock
though
he
was
virtually
illiterate
and
could
not
even
spell
correctly
he
himself
wrote
the
articles
of
the
gazette
with
a
humility
and
rancour
that
compensated
for
his
lack
of
talent
the
marquis
in
entering
on
the
campaign
had
perceived
immediately
the
advantage
that
might
be
derived
from
the
of
this
insipid
sacristan
with
the
coarse
mercenary
pen
after
the
february
revolution
the
articles
in
the
gazette
contained
fewer
mistakes
the
marquis
revised
them
one
can
now
imagine
what
a
singular
spectacle
the
rougons
yellow
presented
every
evening
all
opinions
met
there
to
bark
at
the
republic
their
hatred
of
that
institution
made
them
agree
together
the
marquis
who
never
missed
a
meeting
appeased
by
his
presence
the
little
squabbles
which
occasionally
arose
between
the
commander
and
the
other
adherents
these
plebeians
were
inwardly
flattered
by
the
handshakes
which
he
distributed
on
his
arrival
and
departure
roudier
however
like
a
of
the
rue
asserted
that
the
marquis
had
not
a
copper
to
bless
himself
with
and
was
disposed
to
make
light
of
him
de
carnavant
on
his
side
preserved
the
amiable
smile
of
a
nobleman
lowering
himself
to
the
level
of
these
middle
class
people
without
making
any
of
those
contemptuous
grimaces
which
any
other
resident
of
the
quarter
would
have
thought
fit
under
such
circumstances
the
parasite
life
he
had
led
had
rendered
him
supple
he
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
group
commanding
in
the
name
of
unknown
personages
whom
he
never
revealed
they
want
this
they
don
t
want
that
he
would
say
the
concealed
divinities
who
thus
watched
over
the
destinies
of
plassans
from
behind
some
cloud
without
appearing
to
interfere
directly
in
public
matters
must
have
been
certain
priests
the
great
political
agents
of
the
country
when
the
marquis
pronounced
that
mysterious
word
they
which
inspired
the
assembly
with
such
marvellous
respect
vuillet
confessed
with
a
gesture
of
pious
devotion
that
he
knew
them
very
well
the
happiest
person
in
all
this
was
felicite
at
last
she
had
people
coming
to
her
it
was
true
she
felt
a
little
ashamed
of
her
old
yellow
velvet
furniture
she
consoled
herself
however
thinking
of
the
rich
things
she
would
purchase
when
the
good
cause
should
have
triumphed
the
rougons
had
in
the
end
regarded
their
royalism
as
very
serious
felicite
went
as
far
as
to
say
when
roudier
was
not
present
that
if
they
had
not
made
a
fortune
in
the
oil
business
the
fault
lay
in
the
monarchy
of
july
this
was
her
mode
of
giving
a
political
tinge
to
their
poverty
she
had
a
friendly
word
for
everybody
even
for
granoux
inventing
each
evening
some
new
polite
method
of
waking
him
up
when
it
was
time
for
departure
the
that
little
band
of
conservatives
belonging
to
all
parties
and
daily
increasing
in
numbers
soon
wielded
powerful
influence
owing
to
the
diversified
characters
of
its
members
and
especially
to
the
secret
impulse
which
each
one
received
from
the
clergy
it
became
the
centre
of
the
reactionary
movement
and
spread
its
influence
throughout
plassans
the
policy
of
the
marquis
who
sank
his
own
personality
transformed
rougon
into
the
leader
of
the
party
the
meetings
were
held
at
his
house
and
this
circumstance
sufficed
in
the
eyes
of
most
people
to
make
him
the
head
of
the
group
and
draw
public
attention
to
him
the
whole
work
was
attributed
to
him
he
was
believed
to
be
the
chief
artisan
of
the
movement
which
was
gradually
bringing
over
to
the
conservative
party
those
who
had
lately
been
enthusiastic
republicans
there
are
some
situations
which
benefit
only
persons
of
bad
repute
these
lay
the
foundations
of
their
fortune
where
men
of
better
position
and
more
influence
would
never
dare
to
risk
theirs
roudier
granoux
and
the
others
all
men
of
means
and
respectability
certainly
seemed
a
thousand
times
preferable
to
pierre
as
the
acting
leaders
of
the
conservative
party
but
none
of
them
would
have
consented
to
turn
his
into
a
political
centre
their
convictions
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
induce
them
to
compromise
themselves
openly
in
fact
they
were
only
so
many
provincial
babblers
who
liked
to
inveigh
against
the
republic
at
a
neighbour
s
house
as
long
as
the
neighbour
was
willing
to
bear
the
responsibility
of
their
chatter
the
game
was
too
risky
there
was
no
one
among
the
middle
classes
of
plassans
who
cared
to
play
it
except
the
rougons
whose
ungratified
longings
urged
them
on
to
extreme
measures
in
the
month
of
april
eugene
suddenly
left
paris
and
came
to
stay
with
his
father
for
a
fortnight
nobody
ever
knew
the
purpose
of
this
journey
it
is
probable
that
eugene
wanted
to
sound
his
native
town
to
ascertain
whether
he
might
successfully
stand
as
a
candidate
for
the
legislature
which
was
about
to
replace
the
constituent
assembly
he
was
too
shrewd
to
risk
a
failure
no
doubt
public
opinion
appeared
to
him
little
in
his
favour
for
he
abstained
from
any
attempt
it
was
not
known
at
plassans
what
had
become
of
him
in
paris
what
he
was
doing
there
on
his
return
to
his
native
place
folks
found
him
less
heavy
and
somnolent
than
formerly
they
surrounded
him
and
endeavoured
to
make
him
speak
out
concerning
the
political
situation
but
he
feigned
ignorance
and
compelled
them
to
talk
a
little
perspicacity
would
have
detected
that
beneath
his
apparent
unconcern
there
was
great
anxiety
with
regard
to
the
political
opinions
of
the
town
however
he
seemed
to
be
sounding
the
ground
more
on
behalf
of
a
party
than
on
his
own
account
although
he
had
renounced
all
hope
for
himself
he
remained
at
plassans
until
the
end
of
the
month
assiduously
attending
the
meetings
in
the
yellow
as
soon
as
the
bell
rang
announcing
the
first
visitor
he
would
take
up
his
position
in
one
of
the
window
recesses
as
far
as
possible
from
the
lamp
and
he
remained
there
the
whole
evening
resting
his
chin
on
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
and
listening
religiously
the
greatest
absurdities
did
not
disturb
his
equanimity
he
nodded
approval
even
to
the
wild
grunts
of
granoux
when
anyone
asked
him
his
own
opinion
he
politely
repeated
that
of
the
majority
nothing
seemed
to
tire
his
patience
neither
the
hollow
dreams
of
the
marquis
who
spoke
of
the
bourbons
as
if
were
a
recent
date
nor
the
effusions
of
citizen
roudier
who
grew
quite
pathetic
when
he
recounted
how
many
pairs
of
socks
he
had
supplied
to
the
citizen
king
louis
philippe
on
the
contrary
he
seemed
quite
at
his
ease
in
this
tower
of
babel
sometimes
when
these
grotesque
personages
were
storming
against
the
republic
his
eyes
would
smile
while
his
lips
retained
their
expression
of
gravity
his
meditative
manner
of
listening
and
his
invariable
complacency
had
earned
him
the
sympathy
of
everyone
he
was
considered
a
nonentity
but
a
very
decent
fellow
whenever
an
old
oil
or
almond
dealer
failed
to
get
a
hearing
amidst
the
clamour
for
some
plan
by
which
he
could
save
france
if
he
were
only
a
master
he
took
himself
off
to
eugene
and
shouted
his
marvellous
suggestions
in
his
ear
and
eugene
gently
nodded
his
head
as
though
delighted
with
the
grand
projects
he
was
listening
to
vuillet
alone
regarded
him
with
a
suspicious
eye
this
bookseller
and
spoke
less
than
the
others
but
was
more
observant
he
had
noticed
that
eugene
occasionally
conversed
at
times
in
a
corner
with
commander
sicardot
so
he
determined
to
watch
them
but
never
succeeded
in
overhearing
a
word
eugene
silenced
the
commander
by
a
wink
whenever
vuillet
approached
them
from
that
time
sicardot
never
spoke
of
the
napoleons
without
a
mysterious
smile
two
days
before
his
return
to
paris
eugene
met
his
brother
aristide
on
the
cours
sauvaire
and
the
latter
accompanied
him
for
a
short
distance
with
the
importunity
of
a
man
in
search
of
advice
as
a
matter
of
fact
aristide
was
in
great
perplexity
ever
since
the
proclamation
of
the
republic
he
had
manifested
the
most
lively
enthusiasm
for
the
new
government
his
intelligence
sharpened
by
two
years
stay
at
paris
enabled
him
to
see
farther
than
the
thick
heads
of
plassans
he
divined
the
powerlessness
of
the
legitimists
and
orleanists
without
clearly
distinguishing
however
what
third
thief
would
come
and
juggle
the
republic
away
at
all
hazard
he
had
ranged
himself
on
the
side
of
the
victors
and
he
had
severed
his
connection
with
his
father
whom
he
publicly
denounced
as
an
old
fool
an
old
dolt
whom
the
nobility
had
bamboozled
yet
my
mother
is
an
intelligent
woman
he
would
add
i
should
never
have
thought
her
capable
of
inducing
her
husband
to
join
a
party
whose
hopes
are
simply
chimerical
they
are
taking
the
right
course
to
end
their
lives
in
poverty
but
then
women
know
nothing
about
for
his
part
he
wanted
to
sell
himself
as
dearly
as
possible
his
great
anxiety
as
to
the
direction
in
which
the
wind
was
blowing
so
that
he
might
invariably
range
himself
on
the
side
of
that
party
which
in
the
hour
of
triumph
would
be
able
to
reward
him
munificently
unfortunately
he
was
groping
in
the
dark
shut
up
in
his
far
away
province
without
a
guide
without
any
precise
information
he
felt
quite
lost
while
waiting
for
events
to
trace
out
a
sure
and
certain
path
he
preserved
the
enthusiastic
republican
attitude
which
he
had
assumed
from
the
very
first
day
thanks
to
this
demeanour
he
remained
at
the
and
his
salary
was
even
raised
burning
however
with
the
desire
to
play
a
prominent
part
he
persuaded
a
bookseller
one
of
vuillet
s
rivals
to
establish
a
democratic
journal
to
which
he
became
one
of
the
most
energetic
contributors
under
his
impulse
the
independant
waged
merciless
warfare
against
the
reactionaries
but
the
current
gradually
carried
him
further
than
he
wished
to
go
he
ended
by
writing
inflammatory
articles
which
made
him
shudder
when
he
them
it
was
remarked
at
plassans
that
he
directed
a
series
of
attacks
against
all
whom
his
father
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
of
an
evening
in
his
famous
yellow
the
fact
is
that
the
wealth
of
roudier
and
granoux
exasperated
aristide
to
such
a
degree
as
to
make
him
forget
all
prudence
urged
on
by
his
jealous
insatiate
bitterness
he
had
already
made
the
middle
classes
his
irreconcilable
enemy
when
eugene
s
arrival
and
demeanour
at
plassans
caused
him
great
consternation
he
confessed
to
himself
that
his
brother
was
a
skilful
man
according
to
him
that
big
drowsy
fellow
always
slept
with
one
eye
open
like
a
cat
lying
in
wait
before
a
and
now
here
was
eugene
spending
entire
evenings
in
the
yellow
and
devoting
himself
to
those
same
grotesque
personages
whom
he
aristide
had
so
mercilessly
ridiculed
when
he
discovered
from
the
gossip
of
the
town
that
his
brother
shook
hands
with
granoux
and
the
marquis
he
asked
himself
with
considerable
anxiety
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
could
he
himself
have
been
deceived
had
the
legitimists
or
the
orleanists
really
any
chance
of
success
the
thought
terrified
him
he
lost
his
equilibrium
and
as
frequently
happens
he
fell
upon
the
conservatives
with
increased
rancour
as
if
to
avenge
his
own
blindness
on
the
evening
prior
to
the
day
when
he
stopped
eugene
on
the
cours
sauvaire
he
had
published
in
the
independant
a
terrible
article
on
the
intrigues
of
the
clergy
in
response
to
a
short
paragraph
from
vuillet
who
had
accused
the
republicans
of
desiring
to
demolish
the
churches
vuillet
was
aristide
s
bugbear
never
a
week
passed
but
these
two
journalists
exchanged
the
greatest
insults
in
the
provinces
where
a
periphrastic
style
is
still
cultivated
polemics
are
clothed
in
phrases
aristide
called
his
adversary
brother
judas
or
slave
of
vuillet
gallantly
retorted
by
terming
the
republican
a
monster
glutted
with
blood
whose
ignoble
purveyor
was
the
in
order
to
sound
his
brother
aristide
who
did
not
dare
to
appear
openly
uneasy
contented
himself
with
asking
did
you
read
my
article
yesterday
what
do
you
think
of
it
eugene
lightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
re
a
simpleton
brother
was
his
sole
reply
then
you
think
vuillet
right
cried
the
journalist
turning
pale
you
believe
in
vuillet
s
triumph
i
vuillet
he
was
certainly
about
to
add
vuillet
is
as
big
a
fool
as
you
but
observing
his
brother
s
distorted
face
anxiously
extended
towards
him
he
experienced
sudden
mistrust
vuillet
has
his
good
points
he
calmly
replied
on
parting
from
his
brother
aristide
felt
more
perplexed
than
before
eugene
must
certainly
have
been
making
game
of
him
for
vuillet
was
really
the
most
abominable
person
imaginable
however
he
determined
to
be
prudent
and
not
tie
himself
down
any
more
for
he
wished
to
have
his
hands
free
should
he
ever
be
called
upon
to
help
any
party
in
strangling
the
republic
eugene
on
the
morning
of
his
departure
an
hour
before
getting
into
the
diligence
took
his
father
into
the
bedroom
and
had
a
long
conversation
with
him
felicite
who
remained
in
the
vainly
tried
to
catch
what
they
were
saying
they
spoke
in
whispers
as
if
they
feared
lest
a
single
word
should
be
heard
outside
when
at
last
they
quitted
the
bedroom
they
seemed
in
high
spirits
after
kissing
his
father
and
mother
eugene
who
usually
spoke
in
a
drawling
tone
exclaimed
with
vivacity
you
have
understood
me
father
there
lies
our
fortune
we
must
work
with
all
our
energy
in
that
direction
trust
in
i
ll
follow
your
instructions
faithfully
rougon
replied
only
don
t
forget
what
i
asked
you
as
the
price
of
my
if
we
succeed
your
demands
shall
be
satisfied
i
give
you
my
word
moreover
i
will
write
to
you
and
guide
you
according
to
the
direction
which
events
may
take
mind
no
panic
or
excitement
you
must
obey
me
what
have
you
been
plotting
there
felicite
asked
inquisitively
my
dear
mother
eugene
replied
with
a
smile
you
have
had
too
little
faith
in
me
thitherto
to
induce
me
to
confide
in
you
my
hopes
particularly
as
at
present
they
are
only
based
on
probabilities
to
be
able
to
understand
me
you
would
require
faith
however
father
will
inform
you
when
the
right
time
then
as
felicite
assumed
the
demeanour
of
a
woman
who
feels
somewhat
piqued
he
added
in
her
ear
as
he
kissed
her
once
more
i
take
after
you
although
you
disowned
me
too
much
intelligence
would
be
dangerous
at
the
present
moment
when
the
crisis
comes
it
is
you
who
will
have
to
manage
the
he
then
quitted
the
room
but
suddenly
the
door
exclaimed
in
an
imperious
tone
above
all
things
do
not
trust
aristide
he
is
a
who
would
spoil
everything
i
have
studied
him
sufficiently
to
feel
certain
that
he
will
always
fall
on
his
feet
don
t
have
any
pity
if
we
make
a
fortune
he
ll
know
well
enough
how
to
rob
us
of
his
when
eugene
had
gone
felicite
endeavoured
to
ferret
out
the
secret
that
was
being
hidden
from
her
she
knew
her
husband
too
well
to
interrogate
him
openly
he
would
have
angrily
replied
that
it
was
no
business
of
hers
in
spite
however
of
the
clever
tactics
she
pursued
she
learnt
absolutely
nothing
eugene
had
chosen
a
good
confidant
for
those
troubled
times
when
the
greatest
discretion
was
necessary
pierre
flattered
by
his
son
s
confidence
exaggerated
that
passive
ponderosity
which
made
him
so
impenetrable
when
felicite
saw
she
would
not
learn
anything
from
him
she
ceased
to
flutter
round
him
on
one
point
only
did
she
remain
inquisitive
but
in
this
respect
her
curiosity
was
intense
the
two
men
had
mentioned
a
price
stipulated
by
pierre
himself
what
could
that
price
be
this
after
all
was
the
sole
point
of
interest
for
felicite
who
did
not
care
a
rap
for
political
matters
she
knew
that
her
husband
must
have
sold
himself
dearly
but
she
was
burning
to
know
the
nature
of
the
bargain
one
evening
when
they
had
gone
to
bed
finding
pierre
in
a
good
humour
she
brought
the
conversation
round
to
the
discomforts
of
their
poverty
it
s
quite
time
to
put
an
end
to
this
she
said
we
have
been
ruining
ourselves
in
oil
and
fuel
since
those
gentlemen
have
been
coming
here
and
who
will
pay
the
reckoning
nobody
her
husband
fell
into
the
trap
and
smiled
with
complacent
superiority
patience
said
he
and
with
an
air
of
shrewdness
he
looked
into
his
wife
s
eyes
and
added
would
you
be
glad
to
be
the
wife
of
a
receiver
of
taxes
felicite
s
face
flushed
with
a
joyous
glow
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
clapped
her
old
withered
little
hands
like
a
child
really
she
stammered
at
plassans
pierre
without
replying
gave
a
long
affirmative
nod
he
enjoyed
his
consort
s
astonishment
and
emotion
but
she
at
last
resumed
half
sitting
you
would
have
to
deposit
an
enormous
sum
as
security
i
have
heard
that
our
neighbour
monsieur
peirotte
had
to
deposit
eighty
thousand
francs
with
the
eh
said
the
retired
that
s
nothing
to
do
with
me
eugene
will
see
to
that
he
will
get
the
money
advanced
by
a
banker
in
paris
you
see
i
selected
an
appointment
bringing
in
a
good
income
eugene
at
first
made
a
wry
face
saying
one
must
be
rich
to
occupy
such
posts
to
which
influential
men
were
usually
nominated
i
persisted
however
and
he
yielded
to
be
a
receiver
of
taxes
one
need
not
know
either
greek
or
latin
i
shall
have
a
representative
like
monsieur
peirotte
and
he
will
do
all
the
felicite
listened
to
him
with
rapture
i
guessed
however
he
continued
what
it
was
that
worried
our
dear
son
we
re
not
much
liked
here
people
know
that
we
have
no
means
and
will
make
themselves
obnoxious
but
all
sorts
of
things
occur
in
a
time
of
crisis
eugene
wished
to
get
me
an
appointment
in
another
town
however
i
objected
i
want
to
remain
at
yes
yes
we
must
remain
here
the
old
woman
quickly
replied
we
have
suffered
here
and
here
we
must
triumph
ah
i
ll
crush
them
all
those
fine
ladies
on
the
mail
who
scornfully
eye
my
woollen
dresses
i
didn
t
think
of
the
appointment
of
receiver
of
taxes
at
all
i
thought
you
wanted
to
become
mayor
nonsense
that
appointment
is
honorary
eugene
also
mentioned
the
mayoralty
to
me
i
replied
i
ll
accept
if
you
give
me
an
income
of
fifteen
thousand
this
conversation
in
which
high
figures
flew
about
like
rockets
quite
excited
felicite
she
felt
delightfully
buoyant
but
at
last
she
put
on
a
devout
air
and
gravely
said
come
let
us
reckon
it
out
how
much
will
you
earn
well
said
pierre
the
fixed
salary
i
believe
is
three
thousand
three
thousand
felicite
counted
then
there
is
so
much
per

yes
about
fifteen
thousand

that

on

own
account
it

perhaps
i
shall
be

to

a
venture

i
feel
luck
on
my
well
let
us
say
twenty
thousand
twenty
thousand
francs

year
repeated
felicite
overwhelmed
by
the
amount
we
shall
have
to
repay
the
advances
pierre
observed
that
doesn
t
matter
felicite
replied
we
shall
be
richer
than
many
of
those
gentlemen
are
the
marquis
and
the
others
going
to
share
the
cake
with
you
no
no
it
will
be
all
for
us
he
replied
then
as
she
continued
to
importune
him
with
her
questions
pierre
frowned
thinking
that
she
wanted
to
wrest
his
secret
from
him
we
ve
talked
enough
he
said
abruptly
it
s
late
let
us
go
to
sleep
it
will
bring
us
bad
luck
to
count
our
chickens
beforehand
i
haven
t
got
the
place
yet
above
all
things
be
when
the
lamp
was
extinguished
felicite
could
not
sleep
with
her
eyes
closed
she
built
the
most
marvellous
castles
in
the
air
those
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
danced
a
diabolical
dance
before
her
in
the
darkness
she
occupied
splendid
apartments
in
the
new
town
enjoyed
the
same
luxuries
as
monsieur
peirotte
gave
parties
and
bespattered
the
whole
place
with
her
wealth
that
however
which
tickled
her
vanity
most
was
the
high
position
that
her
husband
would
then
occupy
he
would
pay
their
state
dividends
to
granoux
roudier
and
all
those
people
who
now
came
to
her
house
as
they
might
come
to
a
cafe
to
swagger
and
learn
the
latest
news
she
had
noticed
the
manner
in
which
these
people
entered
her
and
it
had
made
her
take
a
dislike
to
them
even
the
marquis
with
his
ironical
politeness
was
beginning
to
displease
her
to
triumph
alone
therefore
to
keep
the
cake
for
themselves
as
she
expressed
it
was
a
revenge
which
she
fondly
cherished
later
on
when
all
those
persons
presented
themselves
hats
off
before
monsieur
rougon
the
receiver
of
taxes
she
would
crush
them
in
her
turn
she
was
busy
with
these
thoughts
all
night
and
on
the
morrow
as
she
opened
the
shutters
she
instinctively
cast
her
first
glance
across
the
street
towards
monsieur
peirotte
s
house
and
smiled
as
she
contemplated
the
broad
damask
curtains
hanging
in
the
windows
felicite
s
hopes
in
becoming
modified
had
grown
yet
more
intense
like
all
women
she
did
not
object
to
a
tinge
of
mystery
the
secret
object
that
her
husband
was
pursuing
excited
her
far
more
than
the
legitimist
intrigues
of
monsieur
de
carnavant
had
ever
done
she
abandoned
without
much
regret
the
calculations
she
had
based
on
the
marquis
s
success
now
that
her
husband
declared
he
would
be
able
to
make
large
profits
by
other
means
she
displayed
moreover
remarkable
prudence
and
discretion
in
reality
she
was
still
tortured
by
anxious
curiosity
she
studied
pierre
s
slightest
actions
endeavouring
to
discover
their
meaning
what
if
by
chance
he
were
following
the
wrong
track
what
if
eugene
were
dragging
them
in
his
train
into
some
pit
whence
they
would
emerge
yet
more
hungry
and
impoverished
however
faith
was
dawning
on
her
eugene
had
commanded
with
such
an
air
of
authority
that
she
ultimately
came
to
believe
in
him
in
this
case
again
some
unknown
power
was
at
work
pierre
would
speak
mysteriously
of
the
high
personages
whom
their
eldest
son
visited
in
paris
for
her
part
she
did
not
know
what
he
could
have
to
do
with
them
but
on
the
other
hand
she
was
unable
to
close
her
eyes
to
aristide
s
acts
at
plassans
the
visitors
to
her
did
not
scruple
to
denounce
the
democratic
journalist
with
extreme
severity
granoux
muttered
that
he
was
a
brigand
and
roudier
would
three
or
four
times
a
week
repeat
to
felicite
your
son
is
writing
some
fine
articles
only
yesterday
he
attacked
our
friend
vuillet
with
revolting
the
whole
room
joined
in
the
chorus
and
commander
sicardot
spoke
of
boxing
his
s
ears
while
pierre
flatly
disowned
him
the
poor
mother
hung
her
head
restraining
her
tears
for
an
instant
she
felt
an
inclination
to
burst
forth
to
tell
roudier
that
her
dear
child
in
spite
of
his
faults
was
worth
more
than
he
and
all
the
others
put
together
but
she
was
tied
down
and
did
not
wish
to
compromise
the
position
they
had
so
laboriously
attained
seeing
the
whole
town
so
bitter
against
aristide
she
despaired
of
his
future
thinking
he
was
hopelessly
ruining
himself
on
two
occasions
she
spoke
to
him
in
secret
imploring
him
to
return
to
them
and
not
to
irritate
the
yellow
any
further
aristide
replied
that
she
did
not
understand
such
matters
that
she
was
the
one
who
had
committed
a
great
blunder
in
placing
her
husband
at
the
service
of
the
marquis
so
she
had
to
abandon
her
son
to
his
own
courses
resolving
however
that
if
eugene
succeeded
she
would
compel
him
to
share
the
spoils
with
the
poor
fellow
who
was
her
favourite
child
after
the
departure
of
his
eldest
son
pierre
rougon
pursued
his
reactionary
intrigues
nothing
seemed
to
have
changed
in
the
opinions
of
the
famous
yellow
every
evening
the
same
men
came
to
join
in
the
same
propaganda
in
favour
of
the
establishment
of
a
monarchy
while
the
master
of
the
house
approved
and
aided
them
with
as
much
zeal
as
in
the
past
eugene
had
left
plassans
on
may
a
few
days
later
the
yellow
was
in
raptures
the
gossips
were
discussing
the
letter
of
the
president
of
the
republic
to
general
oudinot
in
which
the
siege
of
rome
had
been
decided
upon
this
letter
was
regarded
as
a
brilliant
victory
due
to
the
firm
demeanour
of
the
reactionary
party
since
the
chambers
had
been
discussing
the
roman
question
but
it
had
been
reserved
for
a
bonaparte
to
stifle
a
rising
republic
by
an
act
of
intervention
which
france
if
free
would
never
have
countenanced
the
marquis
declared
however
that
one
could
not
better
promote
the
cause
of
legitimacy
and
vuillet
wrote
a
superb
article
on
the
matter
the
enthusiasm
became
unbounded
when
a
month
later
commander
sicardot
entered
the
rougons
house
one
evening
and
announced
to
the
company
that
the
french
army
was
fighting
under
the
walls
of
rome
then
while
everybody
was
raising
exclamations
at
this
news
he
went
up
to
pierre
and
shook
hands
with
him
in
a
significant
manner
and
when
he
had
taken
a
seat
he
began
to
sound
the
praises
of
the
president
of
the
republic
who
said
he
was
the
only
person
able
to
save
france
from
anarchy
let
him
save
it
then
as
quickly
as
possible
interrupted
the
marquis
and
let
him
then
understand
his
duty
by
restoring
it
to
its
legitimate
pierre
seemed
to
approve
this
fine
retort
and
having
thus
given
proof
of
his
ardent
royalism
he
ventured
to
remark
that
prince
louis
bonaparte
had
his
entire
sympathy
in
the
matter
he
thereupon
exchanged
a
few
short
sentences
with
the
commander
commending
the
excellent
intentions
of
the
president
which
sentences
one
might
have
thought
prepared
and
learnt
beforehand
bonapartism
now
for
the
first
time
made
its
entry
into
the
yellow
it
is
true
that
since
the
election
of
december
the
prince
had
been
treated
there
with
a
certain
amount
of
consideration
he
was
preferred
a
thousand
times
to
cavaignac
and
the
whole
reactionary
party
had
voted
for
him
but
they
regarded
him
rather
as
an
accomplice
than
a
friend
and
as
such
they
distrusted
him
and
even
began
to
accuse
him
of
a
desire
to
keep
for
himself
the
chestnuts
which
he
had
pulled
out
of
the
fire
on
that
particular
evening
however
owing
to
the
fighting
at
rome
they
listened
with
favour
to
the
praises
of
pierre
and
the
commander
the
group
led
by
granoux
and
roudier
already
demanded
that
the
president
should
order
all
republican
rascals
to
be
shot
while
the
marquis
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
gazed
meditatively
at
a
faded
rose
on
the
carpet
when
he
at
last
lifted
his
head
pierre
who
had
furtively
watched
his
countenance
as
if
to
see
the
effect
of
his
words
suddenly
ceased
speaking
however
monsieur
de
carnavant
merely
smiled
and
glanced
at
felicite
with
a
knowing
look
this
rapid
was
not
observed
by
the
other
people
vuillet
alone
remarked
in
a
sharp
tone
i
would
rather
see
your
bonaparte
at
london
than
at
paris
our
affairs
would
get
along
better
at
this
the
old
turned
slightly
pale
fearing
that
he
had
gone
too
far
i
m
not
anxious
to
retain
my
bonaparte
he
said
with
some
firmness
you
know
where
i
would
send
him
to
if
i
were
the
master
i
simply
assert
that
the
expedition
to
rome
was
a
good
felicite
had
followed
this
scene
with
inquisitive
astonishment
however
she
did
not
speak
of
it
to
her
husband
which
proved
that
she
adopted
it
as
the
basis
of
secret
study
the
marquis
s
smile
the
significance
of
which
escaped
her
set
her
thinking
from
that
day
forward
rougon
at
distant
intervals
whenever
the
occasion
offered
slipped
in
a
good
word
for
the
president
of
the
republic
on
such
evenings
commander
sicardot
acted
the
part
of
a
willing
accomplice
at
the
same
time
clerical
opinions
still
reigned
supreme
in
the
yellow
it
was
more
particularly
in
the
following
year
that
this
group
of
reactionaries
gained
decisive
influence
in
the
town
thanks
to
the
retrograde
movement
which
was
going
on
at
paris
all
those
laws
which
the
country
called
the
roman
expedition
at
home
definitively
secured
the
triumph
of
the
rougon
faction
the
last
enthusiastic
bourgeois
saw
the
republic
tottering
and
hastened
to
rally
round
the
conservatives
thus
the
rougons
hour
had
arrived
the
new
town
almost
gave
them
an
ovation
on
the
day
when
the
tree
of
liberty
planted
on
the
square
before
the
was
sawed
down
this
tree
a
young
poplar
brought
from
the
banks
of
the
viorne
had
gradually
withered
much
to
the
despair
of
the
republican
who
would
come
every
sunday
to
observe
the
progress
of
the
decay
without
being
able
to
comprehend
the
cause
of
it
a
hatter
s
apprentice
at
last
asserted
that
he
had
seen
a
woman
leave
rougon
s
house
and
pour
a
pail
of
poisoned
water
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
it
thenceforward
became
a
matter
of
history
that
felicite
herself
got
up
every
night
to
sprinkle
the
poplar
with
vitriol
when
the
tree
was
dead
the
municipal
council
declared
that
the
dignity
of
the
republic
required
its
removal
for
this
as
they
feared
the
displeasure
of
the
working
classes
they
selected
an
advanced
hour
of
the
night
however
the
conservative
householders
of
the
new
town
got
wind
of
the
little
ceremony
and
all
came
down
to
the
square
before
the
in
order
to
see
how
the
tree
of
liberty
would
fall
the
frequenters
of
the
yellow
stationed
themselves
at
the
windows
there
when
the
poplar
cracked
and
fell
with
a
thud
in
the
darkness
as
tragically
rigid
as
some
mortally
stricken
hero
felicite
felt
bound
to
wave
a
white
handkerchief
this
induced
the
crowd
to
applaud
and
many
responded
to
the
salute
by
waving
their
handkerchiefs
likewise
a
group
of
people
even
came
under
the
window
shouting
we
ll
bury
it
we
ll
bury
they
meant
the
republic
no
doubt
such
was
felicite
s
emotion
that
she
almost
had
a
nervous
attack
it
was
a
fine
evening
for
the
yellow
however
the
marquis
still
looked
at
felicite
with
the
same
mysterious
smile
this
little
old
man
was
far
too
shrewd
to
be
ignorant
of
whither
france
was
tending
he
was
among
the
first
to
scent
the
coming
of
the
empire
when
the
legislative
assembly
later
on
exhausted
its
energies
in
useless
squabbling
when
the
orleanists
and
the
legitimists
tacitly
accepted
the
idea
of
the
coup
d
etat
he
said
to
himself
that
the
game
was
definitely
lost
in
fact
he
was
the
only
one
who
saw
things
clearly
vuillet
certainly
felt
that
the
cause
of
henry
which
his
paper
defended
was
becoming
detestable
but
it
mattered
little
to
him
he
was
content
to
be
the
obedient
creature
of
the
clergy
his
entire
policy
was
framed
so
as
to
enable
him
to
dispose
of
as
many
rosaries
and
sacred
images
as
possible
as
for
roudier
and
granoux
they
lived
in
a
state
of
blind
scare
it
was
not
certain
whether
they
really
had
any
opinions
all
that
they
desired
was
to
eat
and
sleep
in
peace
their
political
aspirations
went
no
further
the
marquis
though
he
had
bidden
farewell
to
his
hopes
continued
to
come
to
the
rougons
as
regularly
as
ever
he
enjoyed
himself
there
the
clash
of
rival
ambitions
among
the
middle
classes
and
the
display
of
their
follies
had
become
an
extremely
amusing
spectacle
to
him
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
again
shutting
himself
in
the
little
room
which
he
owed
to
the
beneficence
of
the
count
de
valqueyras
with
a
kind
of
malicious
delight
he
kept
to
himself
the
conviction
that
the
bourbons
hour
had
not
yet
arrived
he
feigned
blindness
working
as
hitherto
for
the
triumph
of
legitimacy
and
still
remaining
at
the
orders
of
the
clergy
and
nobility
though
from
the
very
first
day
he
had
penetrated
pierre
s
new
course
of
action
and
believed
that
felicite
was
his
accomplice
one
evening
being
the
first
to
arrive
he
found
the
old
lady
alone
in
the
well
little
one
he
asked
with
his
smiling
familiarity
are
your
affairs
going
on
all
right
why
the
deuce
do
you
make
such
mysteries
with
me
i
m
not
hiding
anything
from
you
felicite
replied
somewhat
perplexed
come
do
you
think
you
can
deceive
an
old
fox
like
me
eh
my
dear
child
treat
me
as
a
friend
i
m
quite
ready
to
help
you
secretly
come
now
be
frank
a
bright
idea
struck
felicite
she
had
nothing
to
tell
but
perhaps
she
might
find
out
something
if
she
kept
quiet
why
do
you
smile
monsieur
de
carnavant
resumed
that
s
the
beginning
of
a
confession
you
know
i
suspected
that
you
must
be
behind
your
husband
pierre
is
too
stupid
to
invent
the
pretty
treason
you
are
hatching
i
sincerely
hope
the
bonapartists
will
give
you
what
i
should
have
asked
for
you
from
the
this
single
sentence
confirmed
the
suspicions
which
the
old
woman
had
entertained
for
some
time
past
prince
louis
has
every
chance
hasn
t
he
she
eagerly
inquired
will
you
betray
me
if
i
tell
you
that
i
believe
so
the
marquis
laughingly
replied
i
ve
donned
my
mourning
over
it
little
one
i
m
simply
a
poor
old
man
worn
out
and
only
fit
to
be
laid
on
the
shelf
it
was
for
you
however
that
i
was
working
since
you
have
been
able
to
find
the
right
track
without
me
i
shall
feel
some
consolation
in
seeing
you
triumph
amidst
my
own
defeat
above
all
things
don
t
make
any
more
mysteries
come
to
me
if
you
are
ever
in
and
he
added
with
the
sceptical
smile
of
a
nobleman
who
has
lost
caste
pshaw
i
also
can
go
in
for
a
little
treachery
at
this
moment
the
clan
of
retired
oil
and
almond
dealers
arrived
ah
the
dear
reactionaries
monsieur
de
carnavant
continued
in
an
undertone
you
see
little
one
the
great
art
of
politics
consists
in
having
a
pair
of
good
eyes
when
other
people
are
blind
you
hold
all
the
best
cards
in
the
on
the
following
day
felicite
incited
by
this
conversation
desired
to
make
sure
on
the
matter
they
were
then
in
the
first
days
of
the
year
for
more
than
eighteen
months
rougon
had
been
in
the
habit
of
receiving
a
letter
from
his
son
eugene
regularly
every
fortnight
he
would
shut
himself
in
the
bedroom
to
read
these
letters
which
he
then
hid
at
the
bottom
of
an
old
secretaire
the
key
of
which
he
carefully
kept
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
whenever
his
wife
questioned
him
about
their
son
he
would
simply
answer
eugene
writes
that
he
is
going
on
all
felicite
had
long
since
thought
of
laying
hands
on
her
son
s
letters
so
early
on
the
morning
after
her
chat
with
the
marquis
while
pierre
was
still
asleep
she
got
up
on
tiptoes
took
the
key
of
the
secretaire
from
her
husband
s
waistcoat
and
substituted
in
its
place
that
of
the
chest
of
drawers
which
was
of
the
same
size
then
as
soon
as
her
husband
had
gone
out
she
shut
herself
in
the
room
in
her
turn
emptied
the
drawer
and
read
all
the
letters
with
feverish
curiosity
monsieur
de
carnavant
had
not
been
mistaken
and
her
own
suspicions
were
confirmed
there
were
about
forty
letters
which
enabled
her
to
follow
the
course
of
that
great
bonapartist
movement
which
was
to
terminate
in
the
second
empire
the
letters
constituted
a
sort
of
concise
journal
narrating
events
as
they
occurred
and
drawing
hopes
and
suggestions
from
each
of
them
eugene
was
full
of
faith
he
described
prince
louis
bonaparte
to
his
father
as
the
predestined
necessary
man
who
alone
could
unravel
the
situation
he
had
believed
in
him
prior
even
to
his
return
to
france
at
a
time
when
bonapartism
was
treated
as
a
ridiculous
chimera
felicite
understood
that
her
son
had
been
a
very
active
secret
agent
since
although
he
did
not
clearly
explain
his
position
in
paris
it
was
evident
that
he
was
working
for
the
empire
under
the
orders
of
personages
whose
names
he
mentioned
with
a
sort
of
familiarity
each
of
his
letters
gave
information
as
to
the
progress
of
the
cause
to
which
an
early
denouement
was
foreshadowed
and
usually
concluded
by
pointing
out
the
line
of
action
that
pierre
should
pursue
at
plassans
felicite
could
now
comprehend
certain
words
and
acts
of
her
husband
whose
significance
had
previously
escaped
her
pierre
was
obeying
his
son
and
blindly
following
his
recommendations
when
the
old
woman
had
finished
reading
she
was
convinced
eugene
s
entire
thoughts
were
clearly
revealed
to
her
he
reckoned
upon
making
his
political
fortune
in
the
squabble
and
repaying
his
parents
the
debt
he
owed
them
for
his
education
by
throwing
them
a
scrap
of
the
prey
as
soon
as
the
quarry
was
secured
however
small
the
assistance
his
father
might
render
to
him
and
to
the
cause
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
get
him
appointed
receiver
of
taxes
nothing
would
be
refused
to
one
who
like
eugene
had
steeped
his
hands
in
the
most
secret
machinations
his
letters
were
simply
a
kind
attention
on
his
part
a
device
to
prevent
the
rougons
from
committing
any
act
of
imprudence
for
which
felicite
felt
deeply
grateful
she
read
certain
passages
of
the
letters
twice
over
notably
those
in
which
eugene
spoke
in
vague
terms
of
a
final
this
catastrophe
the
nature
or
bearings
of
which
she
could
not
well
conceive
became
a
sort
of
end
of
the
world
for
her
god
would
range
the
chosen
ones
on
his
right
hand
and
the
damned
on
his
left
and
she
placed
herself
among
the
former
when
she
succeeded
in
replacing
the
key
in
her
husband
s
waistcoat
pocket
on
the
following
night
she
made
up
her
mind
to
employ
the
same
expedient
for
reading
every
fresh
letter
that
arrived
she
resolved
likewise
to
profess
complete
ignorance
this
plan
was
an
excellent
one
henceforward
she
gave
her
husband
the
more
assistance
as
she
appeared
to
render
it
unconsciously
when
pierre
thought
he
was
working
alone
it
was
she
who
brought
the
conversation
round
to
the
desired
topic
recruiting
partisans
for
the
decisive
moment
she
felt
hurt
at
eugene
s
distrust
of
her
she
wanted
to
be
able
to
say
to
him
after
the
triumph
i
knew
all
and
so
far
from
spoiling
anything
i
have
secured
the
never
did
an
accomplice
make
less
noise
or
work
harder
the
marquis
whom
she
had
taken
into
her
confidence
was
astounded
at
it
the
fate
of
her
dear
aristide
however
continued
to
make
her
uneasy
now
that
she
shared
the
faith
of
her
eldest
son
the
rabid
articles
of
the
independant
alarmed
her
all
the
more
she
longed
to
convert
the
unfortunate
republican
to
napoleonist
ideas
but
she
did
not
know
how
to
accomplish
this
in
a
discreet
manner
she
recalled
the
emphasis
with
which
eugene
had
told
them
to
be
on
their
guard
against
aristide
at
last
she
submitted
the
matter
to
monsieur
de
carnavant
who
was
entirely
of
the
same
opinion
little
one
he
said
to
her
in
politics
one
must
know
how
to
look
after
one
s
self
if
you
were
to
convert
your
son
and
the
independant
were
to
start
writing
in
defence
of
bonapartism
it
would
deal
the
party
a
rude
blow
the
independant
has
already
been
condemned
its
title
alone
suffices
to
enrage
the
middle
classes
of
plassans
let
dear
aristide
flounder
about
this
only
moulds
young
people
he
does
not
appear
to
me
to
be
cut
out
for
carrying
on
the
role
of
a
martyr
for
any
length
of
however
in
her
eagerness
to
point
out
the
right
way
to
her
family
now
that
she
believed
herself
in
possession
of
the
truth
felicite
even
sought
to
convert
her
son
pascal
the
doctor
with
the
egotism
of
a
scientist
immersed
in
his
researches
gave
little
heed
to
politics
empires
might
fall
while
he
was
making
an
experiment
yet
he
would
not
have
deigned
to
turn
his
head
he
at
last
yielded
however
to
certain
importunities
of
his
mother
who
accused
him
more
than
ever
of
living
like
an
unsociable
churl
if
you
were
to
go
into
society
she
said
to
him
you
would
get
some
patients
come
at
least
and
spend
some
evenings
in
our
you
will
make
the
acquaintance
of
messieurs
roudier
granoux
and
sicardot
all
gentlemen
in
good
circumstances
who
will
pay
you
four
or
five
francs
a
visit
the
poor
people
will
never
enrich
the
idea
of
succeeding
in
life
of
seeing
all
her
family
attain
to
fortune
had
become
a
form
of
monomania
with
felicite
pascal
in
order
to
be
agreeable
to
her
came
and
spent
a
few
evenings
in
the
yellow
he
was
much
less
bored
there
than
he
had
apprehended
at
first
he
was
rather
stupefied
at
the
degree
of
imbecility
to
which
sane
men
can
sink
the
old
oil
and
almond
dealers
the
marquis
and
the
commander
even
appeared
to
him
so
many
curious
animals
which
he
had
not
hitherto
had
an
opportunity
of
studying
he
looked
with
a
naturalist
s
interest
at
their
grimacing
faces
in
which
he
discerned
traces
of
their
occupations
and
appetites
he
listened
also
to
their
inane
chatter
just
as
he
might
have
tried
to
catch
the
meaning
of
a
cat
s
mew
or
a
dog
s
bark
at
this
period
he
was
occupied
with
comparative
natural
history
applying
to
the
human
race
the
observations
which
he
had
made
upon
animals
with
regard
to
the
working
of
heredity
while
he
was
in
the
yellow
therefore
he
amused
himself
with
the
belief
that
he
had
fallen
in
with
a
menagerie
he
established
comparisons
between
the
grotesque
creatures
he
found
there
and
certain
animals
of
his
acquaintance
the
marquis
with
his
leanness
and
small
head
reminded
him
exactly
of
a
long
green
grasshopper
vuillet
impressed
him
as
a
pale
slimy
toad
he
was
more
considerate
for
roudier
a
fat
sheep
and
for
the
commander
an
old
toothless
mastiff
but
the
prodigious
granoux
was
a
perpetual
cause
of
astonishment
to
him
he
spent
a
whole
evening
measuring
this
imbecile
s
facial
angle
when
he
heard
him
mutter
indistinct
imprecations
against
those
the
republicans
he
always
expected
to
hear
him
moan
like
a
calf
and
he
could
never
see
him
rise
from
his
chair
without
imagining
that
he
was
about
to
leave
the
room
on
all
fours
talk
to
them
his
mother
used
to
say
in
an
undertone
try
and
make
a
practice
out
of
these
i
am
not
a
veterinary
surgeon
he
at
last
replied
exasperated
one
evening
felicite
took
him
into
a
corner
and
tired
to
catechise
him
she
was
glad
to
see
him
come
to
her
house
rather
assiduously
she
thought
him
reconciled
to
society
not
suspecting
for
a
moment
the
singular
amusement
that
he
derived
from
ridiculing
these
rich
people
she
cherished
the
secret
project
of
making
him
the
fashionable
doctor
of
plassans
it
would
be
sufficient
if
men
like
granoux
and
roudier
consented
to
give
him
a
start
she
wished
above
all
to
impart
to
him
the
political
views
of
the
family
considering
that
a
doctor
had
everything
to
gain
by
constituting
himself
a
warm
partisan
of
the
regime
which
was
to
succeed
the
republic
my
dear
boy
she
said
to
him
as
you
have
now
become
reasonable
you
must
give
some
thought
to
the
future
you
are
accused
of
being
a
republican
because
you
are
foolish
enough
to
attend
all
the
beggars
of
the
town
without
making
any
charge
be
frank
what
are
your
real
opinions
pascal
looked
at
his
mother
with
naïve
astonishment
then
with
a
smile
replied
my
real
opinions
i
don
t
quite
know
i
am
accused
of
being
a
republican
did
you
say
very
well
i
don
t
feel
at
all
offended
i
am
undoubtedly
a
republican
if
you
understand
by
that
word
a
man
who
wishes
the
welfare
of
but
you
will
never
attain
to
any
position
felicite
quickly
interrupted
you
will
be
crushed
look
at
your
brothers
they
are
trying
to
make
their
pascal
then
comprehended
that
he
was
not
called
upon
to
defend
his
philosophic
egotism
his
mother
simply
accused
him
of
not
speculating
on
the
political
situation
he
began
to
laugh
somewhat
sadly
and
then
turned
the
conversation
into
another
channel
felicite
could
never
induce
him
to
consider
the
chances
of
the
various
parties
nor
to
enlist
in
that
one
of
them
which
seemed
likely
to
carry
the
day
however
he
still
occasionally
came
to
spend
an
evening
in
the
yellow
granoux
interested
him
like
an
antediluvian
animal
in
the
meantime
events
were
moving
the
year
was
a
year
of
anxiety
and
apprehension
for
the
politicians
of
plassans
and
the
cause
which
the
rougons
served
derived
advantage
from
this
circumstance
the
most
contradictory
news
arrived
from
paris
sometimes
the
republicans
were
in
the
ascendant
sometimes
the
conservative
party
was
crushing
the
republic
the
echoes
of
the
squabbles
which
were
rending
the
legislative
assembly
reached
the
depths
of
the
provinces
now
in
an
exaggerated
now
in
an
attenuated
form
varying
so
greatly
as
to
obscure
the
vision
of
the
most
the
only
general
feeling
was
that
a
denouement
was
approaching
the
prevailing
ignorance
as
to
the
nature
of
this
denouement
kept
timid
middle
class
people
in
a
terrible
state
of
anxiety
everybody
wished
to
see
the
end
they
were
sick
of
uncertainty
and
would
have
flung
themselves
into
the
arms
of
the
grand
turk
if
he
would
have
deigned
to
save
france
from
anarchy
the
marquis
s
smile
became
more
acute
of
an
evening
in
the
yellow
when
granoux
s
growl
was
rendered
indistinct
by
fright
he
would
draw
near
to
felicite
and
whisper
in
her
ear
come
little
one
the
fruit
is
ripe
but
you
must
make
yourself
felicite
who
continued
to
read
eugene
s
letters
and
knew
that
a
decisive
crisis
might
any
day
occur
had
already
often
felt
the
necessity
of
making
herself
useful
and
reflected
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
rougons
should
employ
themselves
at
last
she
consulted
the
marquis
it
all
depends
upon
circumstances
the
little
old
man
replied
if
the
department
remains
quiet
if
no
insurrection
occurs
to
terrify
plassans
it
will
be
difficult
for
you
to
make
yourselves
conspicuous
and
render
any
services
to
the
new
government
i
advise
you
in
that
case
to
remain
at
home
and
peacefully
await
the
bounties
of
your
son
eugene
but
if
the
people
rise
and
our
brave
bourgeois
think
themselves
in
danger
there
will
be
a
fine
part
to
play
your
husband
is
somewhat
heavy
oh
said
felicite
i
ll
undertake
to
make
him
supple
do
you
think
the
department
will
revolt
to
my
mind
it
s
a
certainty
plassans
perhaps
will
not
make
a
stir
the
reaction
has
secured
too
firm
a
hold
here
for
that
but
the
neighbouring
towns
especially
the
small
ones
and
the
villages
have
long
been
worked
by
certain
secret
societies
and
belong
to
the
advanced
republican
party
if
a
coup
d
etat
should
burst
forth
the
tocsin
will
be
heard
throughout
the
entire
country
from
the
forests
of
the
seille
to
the
plateau
of
felicite
reflected
you
think
then
she
resumed
that
an
insurrection
is
necessary
to
ensure
our
fortune
that
s
my
opinion
replied
monsieur
de
carnavant
and
he
added
with
a
slightly
ironical
smile
a
new
dynasty
is
never
founded
excepting
upon
an
affray
blood
is
good
manure
it
will
be
a
fine
thing
for
the
rougons
to
date
from
a
massacre
like
certain
illustrious
these
words
accompanied
by
a
sneer
sent
a
cold
chill
through
felicite
s
bones
but
she
was
a
woman
and
the
sight
of
monsieur
peirotte
s
beautiful
curtains
which
she
religiously
viewed
every
morning
sustained
her
courage
whenever
she
felt
herself
giving
way
she
planted
herself
at
the
window
and
contemplated
the
s
house
for
her
it
was
the
tuileries
she
had
determined
upon
the
most
extreme
measures
in
order
to
secure
an
entree
into
the
new
town
that
promised
land
on
the
threshold
of
which
she
had
stood
with
burning
longing
for
so
many
years
the
conversation
which
she
had
held
with
the
marquis
had
at
last
clearly
revealed
the
situation
to
her
a
few
days
afterwards
she
succeeded
in
reading
one
of
eugene
s
letters
in
which
he
who
was
working
for
the
coup
d
etat
seemed
also
to
rely
upon
an
insurrection
as
the
means
of
endowing
his
father
with
some
importance
eugene
knew
his
department
well
all
his
suggestions
had
been
framed
with
the
object
of
placing
as
much
influence
as
possible
in
the
hands
of
the
yellow
reactionaries
so
that
the
rougons
might
be
able
to
hold
the
town
at
the
critical
moment
in
accordance
with
his
desires
the
yellow
was
master
of
plassans
in
november
roudier
represented
the
rich
citizens
there
and
his
attitude
would
certainly
decide
that
of
the
entire
new
town
granoux
was
still
more
valuable
he
had
the
municipal
council
behind
him
he
was
its
most
powerful
member
a
fact
which
will
give
some
idea
of
its
other
members
finally
through
commander
sicardot
whom
the
marquis
had
succeeded
in
getting
appointed
as
chief
of
the
national
guard
the
yellow
had
the
armed
forces
at
their
disposal
the
rougons
those
poor
disreputable
devils
had
thus
succeeded
in
rallying
round
themselves
the
instruments
of
their
own
fortune
everyone
from
cowardice
or
stupidity
would
have
to
obey
them
and
work
in
the
dark
for
their
aggrandisement
they
simply
had
to
fear
those
other
influences
which
might
be
working
with
the
same
object
as
themselves
and
might
partially
rob
them
of
the
merit
of
victory
that
was
their
great
fear
for
they
wanted
to
reserve
to
themselves
the
role
of
deliverers
they
knew
beforehand
that
they
would
be
aided
rather
than
hindered
by
the
clergy
and
the
nobility
but
if
the
the
mayor
and
the
other
functionaries
were
to
take
a
step
in
advance
and
at
once
stifle
the
insurrection
they
would
find
themselves
thrown
into
the
shade
and
even
arrested
in
their
exploits
they
would
have
neither
time
nor
means
to
make
themselves
useful
what
they
longed
for
was
complete
abstention
general
panic
among
the
functionaries
if
only
all
regular
administration
should
disappear
and
they
could
dispose
of
the
destinies
of
plassans
for
a
single
day
their
fortune
would
be
firmly
established
happily
for
them
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
government
service
whose
convictions
were
so
firm
or
whose
circumstances
were
so
needy
as
to
make
him
disposed
to
risk
the
game
the
was
a
man
of
liberal
spirit
whom
the
executive
had
forgetfully
left
at
plassans
owing
no
doubt
to
the
good
repute
of
the
town
of
timid
character
and
incapable
of
exceeding
his
authority
he
would
no
doubt
be
greatly
embarrassed
in
the
presence
of
an
insurrection
the
rougons
who
knew
that
he
was
in
favour
of
the
democratic
cause
and
who
consequently
never
dreaded
his
zeal
were
simply
curious
to
know
what
attitude
he
would
assume
as
for
the
municipality
this
did
not
cause
them
much
apprehension
the
mayor
monsieur
garconnet
was
a
legitimist
whose
nomination
had
been
procured
by
the
influence
of
the
quarter
in
he
detested
the
republicans
and
treated
them
with
undisguised
disdain
but
he
was
too
closely
united
by
bonds
of
friendship
with
certain
members
of
the
church
to
lend
any
active
hand
in
a
bonapartist
coup
d
etat
the
other
functionaries
were
in
exactly
the
same
position
the
justices
of
the
peace
the
the
as
well
as
monsieur
peirotte
the
chief
receiver
of
taxes
were
all
indebted
for
their
posts
to
the
clerical
reaction
and
could
not
accept
the
empire
with
any
great
enthusiasm
the
rougons
though
they
did
not
quite
see
how
they
might
get
rid
of
these
people
and
clear
the
way
for
themselves
nevertheless
indulged
in
sanguine
hopes
on
finding
there
was
little
likelihood
of
anybody
disputing
their
role
as
deliverers
the
denouement
was
drawing
near
in
the
last
few
days
of
november
as
the
rumour
of
a
coup
d
etat
was
circulating
the
was
accused
of
seeking
the
position
of
emperor
eh
we
ll
call
him
whatever
he
likes
granoux
exclaimed
provided
he
has
those
republican
rascals
shot
this
exclamation
from
granoux
who
was
believed
to
be
asleep
caused
great
commotion
the
marquis
pretended
not
to
have
heard
it
but
all
the
bourgeois
nodded
approval
roudier
who
being
rich
did
not
fear
to
applaud
the
sentiment
aloud
went
so
far
as
to
declare
while
glancing
askance
at
monsieur
de
carnavant
that
the
position
was
no
longer
tenable
and
that
france
must
be
chastised
as
soon
as
possible
never
mind
by
what
hand
the
marquis
still
maintained
a
silence
which
was
interpreted
as
acquiescence
and
thereupon
the
conservative
clan
abandoning
the
cause
of
legitimacy
ventured
to
offer
up
prayers
in
favour
of
the
empire
my
friends
said
commander
sicardot
rising
from
his
seat
only
a
napoleon
can
now
protect
threatened
life
and
property
have
no
fear
i
ve
taken
the
necessary
precautions
to
preserve
order
at
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
commander
in
concert
with
rougon
had
concealed
in
a
kind
of
near
the
ramparts
both
a
supply
of
cartridges
and
a
considerable
number
of
muskets
he
had
also
taken
steps
to
secure
the
of
the
national
guard
on
which
he
believed
he
could
rely
his
words
produced
a
very
favourable
impression
on
separating
for
the
evening
the
peaceful
citizens
of
the
yellow
spoke
of
massacring
the
reds
if
they
should
dare
to
stir
on
december
pierre
rougon
received
a
letter
from
eugene
which
he
went
to
read
in
his
bedroom
in
accordance
with
his
prudent
habit
felicite
observed
however
that
he
was
very
agitated
when
he
came
out
again
she
fluttered
round
the
secretaire
all
day
when
night
came
she
could
restrain
her
impatience
no
longer
her
husband
had
scarcely
fallen
asleep
when
she
quietly
got
up
took
the
key
of
the
secretaire
from
the
waistcoat
pocket
and
gained
possession
of
the
letter
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
eugene
in
ten
lines
warned
his
father
that
the
crisis
was
at
hand
and
advised
him
to
acquaint
his
mother
with
the
situation
of
affairs
the
hour
for
informing
her
had
arrived
he
might
stand
in
need
of
her
advice
felicite
awaited
on
the
morrow
a
disclosure
which
did
not
come
she
did
not
dare
to
confess
her
curiosity
but
continued
to
feign
ignorance
though
enraged
at
the
foolish
distrust
of
her
husband
who
doubtless
considered
her
a
gossip
and
weak
like
other
women
pierre
with
that
marital
pride
which
inspires
a
man
with
the
belief
in
his
own
superiority
at
home
had
ended
by
attributing
all
their
past
to
his
wife
from
the
time
that
he
fancied
he
had
been
conducting
matters
alone
everything
seemed
to
him
to
have
gone
as
he
desired
he
had
decided
therefore
to
dispense
altogether
with
his
consort
s
counsels
and
to
confide
nothing
to
her
in
spite
of
his
son
s
recommendations
felicite
was
piqued
to
such
a
degree
that
she
would
have
upset
the
whole
affair
had
she
not
desired
the
triumph
as
ardently
as
pierre
so
she
continued
to
work
energetically
for
victory
while
endeavouring
to
take
her
revenge
ah
if
he
could
only
have
some
great
fright
thought
she
if
he
would
only
commit
some
act
of
imprudence
then
i
should
see
him
come
to
me
and
humbly
ask
for
advice
it
would
be
my
turn
to
lay
down
the
she
felt
somewhat
uneasy
at
the
imperious
attitude
pierre
would
certainly
assume
if
he
were
to
triumph
without
her
aid
on
marrying
this
peasant
s
son
in
preference
to
some
notary
s
clerk
she
had
intended
to
make
use
of
him
as
a
strongly
made
puppet
whose
strings
she
would
pull
in
her
own
way
and
now
at
the
decisive
moment
the
puppet
in
his
blind
stupidity
wanted
to
work
alone
all
the
cunning
all
the
feverish
activity
within
the
old
woman
protested
against
this
she
knew
pierre
was
quite
capable
of
some
brutal
resolve
such
as
that
which
he
had
taken
when
he
compelled
his
mother
to
sign
the
receipt
for
fifty
thousand
francs
the
tool
was
indeed
a
useful
and
unscrupulous
one
but
she
felt
the
necessity
for
guiding
it
especially
under
present
circumstances
when
considerable
suppleness
was
requisite
the
official
news
of
the
coup
d
etat
did
not
reach
plassans
until
the
afternoon
of
december
a
thursday
already
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
there
was
a
full
meeting
in
the
yellow
although
the
crisis
had
been
eagerly
desired
vague
uneasiness
appeared
on
the
faces
of
the
majority
they
discussed
events
amid
endless
chatter
pierre
who
like
the
others
was
slightly
pale
thought
it
right
as
an
extreme
measure
of
prudence
to
excuse
prince
louis
s
decisive
act
to
the
legitimists
and
orleanists
who
were
present
there
is
talk
of
an
appeal
to
the
people
he
said
the
nation
will
then
be
free
to
choose
whatever
government
it
likes
the
president
is
a
man
to
retire
before
our
legitimate
the
marquis
who
had
retained
his
aristocratic
coolness
was
the
only
one
who
greeted
these
words
with
a
smile
the
others
in
the
enthusiasm
of
the
moment
concerned
themselves
very
little
about
what
might
follow
all
their
opinions
foundered
roudier
forgetting
the
esteem
which
as
a
former
shopkeeper
he
had
entertained
for
the
orleanists
stopped
pierre
rather
abruptly
and
everybody
exclaimed
don
t
argue
the
matter
let
us
think
of
preserving
these
good
people
were
terribly
afraid
of
the
republicans
there
had
however
been
very
little
commotion
in
the
town
on
the
announcement
of
the
events
in
paris
people
had
collected
in
front
of
the
notices
posted
on
the
door
of
the
it
was
also
rumoured
that
a
few
hundred
workmen
had
left
their
work
and
were
endeavouring
to
organise
resistance
that
was
all
no
serious
disturbance
seemed
likely
to
occur
the
course
which
the
neighbouring
towns
and
rural
districts
might
take
seemed
more
likely
to
occasion
anxiety
however
it
was
not
yet
known
how
they
had
received
the
news
of
the
coup
d
etat
granoux
arrived
at
about
nine
o
clock
quite
out
of
breath
he
had
just
left
a
sitting
of
the
municipal
council
which
had
been
hastily
summoned
together
choking
with
emotion
he
announced
that
the
mayor
monsieur
garconnet
had
declared
while
making
due
reserves
that
he
was
determined
to
preserve
order
by
the
most
stringent
measures
however
the
intelligence
which
caused
the
noisiest
chattering
in
the
yellow
was
that
of
the
resignation
of
the
this
functionary
had
absolutely
refused
to
communicate
the
despatches
of
the
minister
of
the
interior
to
the
inhabitants
of
plassans
he
had
just
left
the
town
so
granoux
asserted
and
it
was
thanks
to
the
mayor
that
the
messages
had
been
posted
this
was
perhaps
the
only
in
france
who
ever
had
the
courage
of
his
democratic
opinions
although
monsieur
garconnet
s
firm
demeanour
caused
the
rougons
some
secret
anxiety
they
rubbed
their
hands
at
the
flight
of
the
which
left
the
post
vacant
for
them
it
was
decided
on
this
memorable
evening
that
the
yellow
party
should
accept
the
coup
d
etat
and
openly
declare
that
it
was
in
favour
of
accomplished
facts
vuillet
was
commissioned
to
write
an
article
to
that
effect
and
publish
it
on
the
morrow
in
the
neither
he
nor
the
marquis
raised
any
objection
they
had
no
doubt
received
instructions
from
the
mysterious
individuals
to
whom
they
sometimes
made
pious
allusions
the
clergy
and
the
nobility
were
already
resigned
to
the
course
of
lending
a
strong
hand
to
the
victors
in
order
to
crush
their
common
enemy
the
republic
while
the
yellow
was
deliberating
on
the
evening
in
question
aristide
was
perspiring
with
anxiety
never
had
gambler
staking
his
last
louis
on
a
card
felt
such
anguish
during
the
day
the
resignation
of
his
chief
the
had
given
him
much
matter
for
reflection
he
had
heard
him
repeat
several
times
that
the
coup
d
etat
must
prove
a
failure
this
functionary
endowed
with
a
limited
amount
of
honesty
believed
in
the
final
triumph
of
the
democracy
though
he
had
not
the
courage
to
work
for
that
triumph
by
offering
resistance
aristide
was
in
the
habit
of
listening
at
the
doors
of
the
in
order
to
get
precise
information
for
he
felt
that
he
was
groping
in
the
dark
and
clung
to
the
intelligence
which
he
gleaned
from
the
officials
the
s
opinion
struck
him
forcibly
but
he
remained
perplexed
he
thought
to
himself
why
does
the
fellow
go
away
if
he
is
so
certain
that
the
will
meet
with
a
check
however
as
he
was
compelled
to
espouse
one
side
or
the
other
he
resolved
to
continue
his
opposition
he
wrote
a
very
hostile
article
on
the
coup
d
etat
and
took
it
to
the
independant
the
same
evening
for
the
following
morning
s
issue
he
had
corrected
the
proofs
of
this
article
and
was
returning
home
somewhat
calmed
when
as
he
passed
along
the
rue
de
la
banne
he
instinctively
raised
his
head
and
glanced
at
the
rougons
windows
their
windows
were
brightly
lighted
up
what
can
they
be
plotting
up
there
the
journalist
asked
himself
with
anxious
curiosity
a
fierce
desire
to
know
the
opinion
of
the
yellow
with
regard
to
recent
events
then
assailed
him
he
credited
this
group
of
reactionaries
with
little
intelligence
but
his
doubts
recurred
he
was
in
that
frame
of
mind
when
one
might
seek
advice
from
a
child
he
could
not
think
of
entering
his
father
s
home
at
that
moment
after
the
campaign
he
had
waged
against
granoux
and
the
others
nevertheless
he
went
upstairs
reflecting
what
a
singular
figure
he
would
cut
if
he
were
surprised
on
the
way
by
anyone
on
reaching
the
rougons
door
he
could
only
catch
a
confused
echo
of
voices
what
a
child
i
am
said
he
fear
makes
me
and
he
was
going
to
descend
again
when
he
heard
the
approach
of
his
mother
who
was
about
to
show
somebody
out
he
had
barely
time
to
hide
in
a
dark
corner
formed
by
a
little
staircase
leading
to
the
garrets
of
the
house
the
rougons
door
opened
and
the
marquis
appeared
followed
by
felicite
monsieur
de
carnavant
usually
left
before
the
gentlemen
of
the
new
town
did
in
order
no
doubt
to
avoid
having
to
shake
hands
with
them
in
the
street
eh
little
one
he
said
on
the
landing
in
a
low
voice
these
men
are
greater
cowards
than
i
should
have
thought
with
such
men
france
will
always
be
at
the
mercy
of
whoever
dares
to
lay
his
hands
upon
her
and
he
added
with
some
bitterness
as
though
speaking
to
himself
the
monarchy
is
decidedly
becoming
too
honest
for
modern
times
its
day
is
eugene
announced
the
crisis
to
his
father
replied
felicite
prince
louis
s
triumph
seems
to
him
oh
you
can
proceed
without
fear
the
marquis
replied
as
he
descended
the
first
steps
in
two
or
three
days
the
country
will
be
well
bound
and
gagged
till
little
felicite
closed
the
door
again
aristide
had
received
quite
a
shock
in
his
dark
corner
however
without
waiting
for
the
marquis
to
reach
the
street
he
bounded
down
the
staircase
four
steps
at
a
time
rushed
outside
like
a
madman
and
turned
his
steps
towards
the
of
the
a
flood
of
thoughts
surged
through
his
mind
he
was
enraged
and
accused
his
family
of
having
duped
him
what
eugene
kept
his
parents
informed
of
the
situation
and
yet
his
mother
had
never
given
him
any
of
his
eldest
brother
s
letters
to
read
in
order
that
he
might
follow
the
advice
given
therein
and
it
was
only
now
he
learnt
by
chance
that
his
eldest
brother
regarded
the
success
of
the
coup
d
etat
as
certain
this
circumstance
moreover
confirmed
certain
presentiments
which
that
idiot
of
a
had
prevented
him
from
obeying
he
was
especially
exasperated
against
his
father
whom
he
had
thought
stupid
enough
to
be
a
legitimist
but
who
revealed
himself
as
a
bonapartist
at
the
right
moment
what
a
lot
of
folly
they
have
allowed
me
to
perpetrate
he
muttered
as
he
ran
along
i
m
a
fine
fellow
now
ah
what
a
lesson
granoux
is
more
capable
than
he
entered
the
office
of
the
independant
like
a
hurricane
and
asked
for
his
article
in
a
choking
voice
the
article
had
already
been
imposed
he
had
the
forme
unlocked
and
would
not
rest
until
he
had
himself
destroyed
the
setting
mixing
the
type
in
a
furious
manner
like
a
set
of
dominoes
the
bookseller
who
managed
the
paper
looked
at
him
in
amazement
he
was
in
reality
rather
glad
of
the
incident
as
the
article
had
seemed
to
him
somewhat
dangerous
but
he
was
absolutely
obliged
to
have
some
copy
if
the
independant
was
to
appear
are
you
going
to
give
me
something
else
he
asked
certainly
replied
aristide
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
began
a
warm
panegyric
on
the
coup
d
etat
at
the
very
first
line
he
swore
that
prince
louis
had
just
saved
the
republic
but
he
had
hardly
written
a
page
before
he
stopped
and
seemed
at
a
loss
how
to
continue
a
troubled
look
came
over
his
face
i
must
go
home
he
said
at
last
i
will
send
you
this
immediately
your
paper
can
appear
a
little
later
if
he
walked
slowly
on
his
way
home
lost
in
meditation
he
was
again
giving
way
to
indecision
why
should
he
veer
round
so
quickly
eugene
was
an
intelligent
fellow
but
his
mother
had
perhaps
exaggerated
the
significance
of
some
sentence
in
his
letter
in
any
case
it
would
be
better
to
wait
and
hold
his
tongue
an
hour
later
angele
called
at
the
bookseller
s
feigning
deep
emotion
my
husband
has
just
severely
injured
himself
she
said
he
jammed
his
four
fingers
in
a
door
as
he
was
coming
in
in
spite
of
his
sufferings
he
has
dictated
this
little
note
which
he
begs
you
to
publish
on
the
following
day
the
independant
made
up
almost
entirely
of
miscellaneous
items
of
news
appeared
with
these
few
lines
at
the
head
of
the
first
column
a
deplorable
accident
which
has
occurred
to
our
eminent
contributor
monsieur
aristide
rougon
will
deprive
us
of
his
articles
for
some
time
he
will
suffer
at
having
to
remain
silent
in
the
present
grave
circumstances
none
of
our
readers
will
doubt
however
the
good
wishes
which
he
offers
up
with
patriotic
feelings
for
the
welfare
of
this
burlesque
note
had

the
last

might
be
interpreted
in

of
all
parties
by
this
expedient
aristide
devised
a
glorious
return
for
himself
on
the
morrow
of
battle
in
the
shape
of
a
laudatory
article
on
the
victors
on
the
following
day
he
showed
himself
to
the
whole
town
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
his
mother
frightened
by
the
notice
in
the
paper
hastily
called
upon
him
but
he
refused
to
show
her
his
hand
and
spoke
with
a
bitterness
which
enlightened
the
old
woman
it
won
t
be
anything
she
said
in
a
reassuring
and
somewhat
sarcastic
tone
as
she
was
leaving
you
only
want
a
little
it
was
no
doubt
owing
to
this
pretended
accident
and
the
s
departure
that
the
independant
was
not
interfered
with
like
most
of
the
democratic
papers
of
the
departments
the
day
of
the
month
proved
comparatively
quiet
at
plassans
in
the
evening
there
was
a
public
demonstration
which
the
mere
appearance
of
the
gendarmes
sufficed
to
disperse
a
band
of
came
to
request
monsieur
garconnet
to
communicate
the
despatches
he
had
received
from
paris
which
the
latter
haughtily
refused
to
do
as
it
retired
the
band
shouted
long
live
the
republic
long
live
the
constitution
after
this
order
was
restored
the
yellow
after
commenting
at
some
length
on
this
innocent
parade
concluded
that
affairs
were
going
on
excellently
the
and
were
however
more
disquieting
intelligence
was
received
of
successive
risings
in
small
neighbouring
towns
the
whole
southern
part
of
the
department
had
taken
up
arms
la
palud
and
had
been
the
first
to
rise
drawing
after
them
the
villages
of
chavanos
nazeres
poujols
valqueyras
and
vernoux
the
yellow
party
was
now
becoming
seriously
alarmed
it
felt
particularly
uneasy
at
seeing
plassans
isolated
in
the
very
midst
of
the
revolt
bands
of
insurgents
would
certainly
scour
the
country
and
cut
off
all
communications
granoux
announced
with
a
terrified
look
that
the
mayor
was
without
any
news
some
people
even
asserted
that
blood
had
been
shed
at
marseilles
and
that
a
formidable
revolution
had
broken
out
in
paris
commander
sicardot
enraged
at
the
cowardice
of
the
bourgeois
vowed
he
would
die
at
the
head
of
his
men
on
sunday
the
the
terror
reached
a
climax
already
at
six
o
clock
the
yellow
where
a
sort
of
reactionary
committee
sat
was
crowded
with
pale
trembling
men
who
conversed
in
undertones
as
though
they
were
in
a
chamber
of
death
it
had
been
ascertained
during
the
day
that
a
column
of
insurgents
about
three
thousand
strong
had
assembled
at
alboise
a
big
village
not
more
than
three
leagues
away
it
was
true
that
this
column
had
been
ordered
to
make
for
the
chief
town
of
the
department
leaving
plassans
on
its
left
but
the
plan
of
campaign
might
at
any
time
be
altered
moreover
it
sufficed
for
these
cowardly
cits
to
know
that
there
were
insurgents
a
few
miles
off
to
make
them
feel
the
horny
hands
of
the
toilers
already
tightened
round
their
throats
they
had
had
a
foretaste
of
the
revolt
in
the
morning
the
few
republicans
at
plassans
seeing
that
they
would
be
unable
to
make
any
determined
move
in
the
town
had
resolved
to
join
their
brethren
of
la
palud
and
the
first
group
had
left
at
about
eleven
o
clock
by
the
porte
de
rome
shouting
the
marseillaise
and
smashing
a
few
windows
granoux
had
had
one
broken
he
mentioned
the
circumstance
with
stammerings
of
terror
meantime
the
most
acute
anxiety
agitated
the
yellow
the
commander
had
sent
his
servant
to
obtain
some
information
as
to
the
exact
movements
of
the
insurgents
and
the
others
awaited
this
man
s
return
making
the
most
astonishing
surmises
they
had
a
full
meeting
roudier
and
granoux
sinking
back
in
their
exchanged
the
most
pitiable
glances
whilst
behind
them
moaned
a
group
of
retired
tradesmen
vuillet
without
appearing
over
scared
reflected
upon
what
precautions
he
should
take
to
protect
his
shop
and
person
he
was
in
doubt
whether
he
should
hide
himself
in
his
garret
or
cellar
and
inclined
towards
the
latter
for
their
part
pierre
and
the
commander
walked
up
and
down
exchanging
a
word
ever
and
anon
the
old
clung
to
this
friend
sicardot
as
if
to
borrow
a
little
courage
from
him
he
who
had
been
awaiting
the
crisis
for
such
a
long
time
now
endeavoured
to
keep
his
countenance
in
spite
of
the
emotion
which
was
stifling
him
as
for
the
marquis
more
spruce
and
smiling
than
usual
he
conversed
in
a
corner
with
felicite
who
seemed
very
gay
at
last
a
ring
came
the
gentlemen
started
as
if
they
had
heard
a
dead
silence
reigned
in
the
when
felicite
went
to
open
the
door
towards
which
their
pale
anxious
faces
were
turned
then
the
commander
s
servant
appeared
on
the
threshold
quite
out
of
breath
and
said
abruptly
to
his
master
sir
the
insurgents
will
be
here
in
an
this
was
a
thunderbolt
they
all
started
up
vociferating
and
raising
their
arms
towards
the
ceiling
for
several
minutes
it
was
impossible
to
hear
one
s
self
speak
the
company
surrounded
the
messenger
overwhelming
him
with
questions
damnation
the
commander
at
length
shouted
don
t
make
such
a
row
be
calm
or
i
won
t
answer
for
everyone
sank
back
in
his
chair
again
heaving
sighs
they
then
obtained
a
few
particulars
the
messenger
had
met
the
column
at
les
tulettes
and
had
hastened
to
return
there
are
at
least
three
thousand
of
them
said
he
they
are
marching
in
battalions
like
soldiers
i
thought
i
caught
sight
of
some
prisoners
in
their
prisoners
cried
the
terrified
bourgeois
no
doubt
the
marquis
interrupted
in
his
shrill
voice
i
ve
heard
that
the
insurgents
arrest
all
persons
who
are
known
to
have
conservative
this
information
gave
a
finishing
touch
to
the
consternation
of
the
yellow
a
few
bourgeois
got
up
and
stealthily
made
for
the
door
reflecting
that
they
had
not
too
much
time
before
them
to
gain
a
place
of
safety
the
announcement
of
the
arrests
made
by
the
republicans
appeared
to
strike
felicite
she
took
the
marquis
aside
and
asked
him
what
do
these
men
do
with
the
people
they
arrest
why
they
carry
them
off
in
their
train
monsieur
de
carnavant
replied
they
no
doubt
consider
them
excellent
ah
the
old
woman
rejoined
in
a
strange
tone
then
she
again
thoughtfully
watched
the
curious
scene
of
panic
around
her
the
bourgeois
gradually
disappeared
soon
there
only
remained
vuillet
and
roudier
whom
the
approaching
danger
inspired
with
some
courage
as
for
granoux
he
likewise
remained
in
his
corner
his
legs
refusing
to
perform
their
office
well
i
like
this
better
sicardot
remarked
as
he
observed
the
flight
of
the
other
adherents
those
cowards
were
exasperating
me
at
last
for
more
than
two
years
they
ve
been
speaking
of
shooting
all
the
republicans
in
the
province
and
they
wouldn
t
even
fire
a
halfpenny
cracker
under
their
then
he
took
up
his
hat
and
turned
towards
the
door
let
s
see
he
continued
time
presses
come
felicite
it
seemed
had
been
waiting
for
this
moment
she
placed
herself
between
the
door
and
her
husband
who
for
that
matter
was
not
particularly
eager
to
follow
the
formidable
sicardot
i
won
t
have
you
go
out
she
cried
feigning
sudden
despair
i
won
t
let
you
leave
my
side
those
scoundrels
will
kill
the
commander
stopped
in
amazement
hang
it
all
he
growled
if
the
women
are
going
to
whine
now
come
along
rougon
no
no
continued
the
old
woman
affecting
increase
of
terror
he
sha
n
t
follow
you
i
will
hang
on
to
his
clothes
and
prevent
the
marquis
very
much
surprised
at
the
scene
looked
inquiringly
at
felicite
was
this
really
the
woman
who
had
just
now
been
conversing
so
merrily
what
comedy
was
she
playing
pierre
meantime
seeing
that
his
wife
wanted
to
detain
him
deigned
a
determination
to
force
his
way
out
i
tell
you
you
shall
not
go
the
old
woman
reiterated
as
she
clung
to
one
of
his
arms
and
turning
towards
the
commander
she
said
to
him
how
can
you
think
of
offering
any
resistance
they
are
three
thousand
strong
and
you
won
t
be
able
to
collect
a
hundred
men
of
any
spirit
you
are
rushing
into
the
cannon
s
mouth
to
no
eh
that
is
our
duty
said
sicardot
impatiently
felicite
burst
into
sobs
if
they
don
t
kill
him
they
ll
make
him
a
prisoner
she
continued
looked
fixedly
at
her
husband
good
heavens
what
will
become
of
me
left
alone
in
an
abandoned
town
but
exclaimed
the
commander
we
shall
be
arrested
just
the
same
if
we
allow
the
insurgents
to
enter
the
town
unmolested
i
believe
that
before
an
hour
has
elapsed
the
mayor
and
all
the
functionaries
will
be
prisoners
to
say
nothing
of
your
husband
and
the
frequenters
of
this
the
marquis
thought
he
saw
a
vague
smile
play
about
felicite
s
lips
as
she
answered
with
a
look
of
dismay
do
you
really
think
so
of
course
replied
sicardot
the
republicans
are
not
so
stupid
as
to
leave
enemies
behind
them
plassans
will
be
emptied
of
its
functionaries
and
good
at
these
words
which
she
had
so
cleverly
provoked
felicite
released
her
husband
s
arms
pierre
no
longer
looked
as
if
he
wanted
to
go
out
thanks
to
his
wife
whose
skilful
tactics
escaped
him
however
and
whose
secret
complicity
he
never
for
a
moment
suspected
he
had
just
lighted
on
a
whole
plan
of
campaign
we
must
deliberate
before
taking
any
decision
he
said
to
the
commander
my
wife
is
perhaps
not
wrong
in
accusing
us
of
forgetting
the
true
interests
of
our
no
indeed
madame
is
not
wrong
cried
granoux
who
had
been
listening
to
felicite
s
terrified
cries
with
the
rapture
of
a
coward
thereupon
the
commander
energetically
clapped
his
hat
on
his
head
and
said
in
a
clear
voice
right
or
wrong
it
matters
little
to
me
i
am
commander
of
the
national
guard
i
ought
to
have
been
at
the
mayor
s
before
now
confess
that
you
are
afraid
that
you
leaven
me
to
act
alone
well
he
was
just
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
when
rougon
forcibly
detained
him
listen
sicardot
he
said
he
drew
him
into
a
corner
on
seeing
vuillet
prick
up
his
big
ears
and
there
he
explained
to
him
in
an
undertone
that
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
leave
a
few
energetic
men
behind
the
insurgents
so
as
to
restore
order
in
the
town
and
as
the
fierce
commander
obstinately
refused
to
desert
his
post
pierre
offered
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
such
a
reserve
corps
give
me
the
key
of
the
in
which
the
arms
and
ammunition
are
kept
he
said
to
him
and
order
some
fifty
of
our
men
not
to
stir
until
i
call
for
sicardot
ended
by
consenting
to
these
prudent
measures
he
entrusted
pierre
with
the
key
of
the
convinced
as
he
was
of
the
inexpediency
of
present
resistance
but
still
desirous
of
sacrificing
himself
during
this
conversation
the
marquis
had
whispered
a
few
words
in
felicite
s
ear
with
a
knowing
look
he
complimented
her
no
doubt
on
her
theatrical
display
the
old
woman
could
not
repress
a
faint
smile
but
as
sicardot
shook
hands
with
rougon
and
prepared
to
go
she
again
asked
him
with
an
air
of
fright
are
you
really
determined
to
leave
us
it
is
not
for
one
of
napoleon
s
old
soldiers
to
let
himself
be
intimidated
by
the
mob
he
replied
he
was
already
on
the
landing
when
granoux
hurried
after
him
crying
if
you
go
to
the
mayor
s
tell
him
what
s
going
on
i
ll
just
run
home
to
my
wife
to
reassure
then
felicite
bent
towards
the
marquis
s
ear
and
whispered
with
discreet
gaiety
upon
my
word
it
is
best
that
devil
of
a
commander
should
go
and
get
himself
arrested
he
s
far
too
however
rougon
brought
granoux
back
to
the
roudier
who
had
quietly
followed
the
scene
from
his
corner
making
signs
in
support
of
the
proposed
measures
of
prudence
got
up
and
joined
them
when
the
marquis
and
vuillet
had
likewise
risen
pierre
began
now
that
we
are
alone
among
peaceable
men
i
propose
that
we
should
conceal
ourselves
so
as
to
avoid
certain
arrest
and
be
at
liberty
as
soon
as
ours
again
becomes
the
stronger
granoux
was
ready
to
embrace
him
roudier
and
vuillet
breathed
more
easily
i
shall
want
you
shortly
gentlemen
the
continued
with
an
important
air
it
is
to
us
that
the
honour
of
restoring
order
in
plassans
is
you
may
rely
upon
us
cried
vuillet
with
an
enthusiasm
which
disturbed
felicite
time
was
pressing
these
singular
defenders
of
plassans
who
hid
themselves
the
better
to
protect
the
town
hastened
away
to
bury
themselves
in
some
hole
or
other
pierre
on
being
left
alone
with
his
wife
advised
her
not
to
make
the
mistake
of
barricading
herself
indoors
but
to
reply
if
anybody
came
to
question
her
that
he
pierre
had
simply
gone
on
a
short
journey
and
as
she
acted
the
simpleton
feigning
terror
and
asking
what
all
this
was
coming
to
he
replied
abruptly
it
s
nothing
to
do
with
you
let
me
manage
our
affairs
alone
they
ll
get
on
all
the
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
rapidly
threading
his
way
along
the
rue
de
la
banne
on
reaching
the
cours
sauvaire
he
saw
a
band
of
armed
workmen
coming
out
of
the
old
quarter
and
singing
the
the
devil
he
thought
it
was
quite
time
indeed
here
s
the
town
itself
in
revolt
now
he
quickened
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
porte
de
rome
cold
perspiration
came
over
him
while
he
waited
there
for
the
dilatory
keeper
to
open
the
gate
almost
as
soon
as
he
set
foot
on
the
high
road
he
perceived
in
the
moonlight
at
the
other
end
of
the
faubourg
the
column
of
insurgents
whose
gun
barrels
gleamed
like
white
flames
so
it
was
at
a
run
that
he
dived
into
the
impasse
and
reached
his
mother
s
house
which
he
had
not
visited
for
many
a
long
year
chapter
iv
antoine
macquart
had
returned
to
plassans
after
the
fall
of
the
first
napoleon
he
had
had
the
incredible
good
fortune
to
escape
all
the
final
murderous
campaigns
of
the
empire
he
had
moved
from
barracks
to
barracks
dragging
on
his
brutifying
military
life
this
mode
of
existence
brought
his
natural
vices
to
full
development
his
idleness
became
deliberate
his
intemperance
which
brought
him
countless
punishments
became
to
his
mind
a
veritable
religious
duty
but
that
which
above
all
made
him
the
worst
of
scapegraces
was
the
supercilious
disdain
which
he
entertained
for
the
poor
devils
who
had
to
earn
their
bread
i
ve
got
money
waiting
for
me
at
home
he
often
said
to
his
comrades
when
i
ve
served
my
time
i
shall
be
able
to
live
like
a
this
belief
together
with
his
stupid
ignorance
prevented
him
from
rising
even
to
the
grade
of
corporal
since
his
departure
he
had
never
spent
a
day
s
furlough
at
plassans
his
brother
having
invented
a
thousand
pretexts
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
he
was
therefore
completely
ignorant
of
the
adroit
manner
in
which
pierre
had
got
possession
of
their
mother
s
fortune
adelaide
with
her
profound
indifference
did
not
even
write
to
him
three
times
to
tell
him
how
she
was
going
on
the
silence
which
generally
greeted
his
numerous
requests
for
money
did
not
awaken
the
least
suspicion
in
him
pierre
s
stinginess
sufficed
to
explain
the
difficulty
he
experienced
in
securing
from
time
to
time
a
paltry
piece
this
however
only
increased
his
animosity
towards
his
brother
who
left
him
to
languish
in
military
service
in
spite
of
his
formal
promise
to
purchase
his
discharge
he
vowed
to
himself
that
on
his
return
home
he
would
no
longer
submit
like
a
child
but
would
flatly
demand
his
share
of
the
fortune
to
enable
him
to
live
as
he
pleased
in
the
diligence
which
conveyed
him
home
he
dreamed
of
a
delightful
life
of
idleness
the
shattering
of
his
castles
in
the
air
was
terrible
when
he
reached
the
faubourg
and
could
no
longer
even
recognise
the
fouques
plot
of
ground
he
was
stupefied
he
was
compelled
to
ask
for
his
mother
s
new
address
there
a
terrible
scene
occurred
adelaide
calmly
informed
him
of
the
sale
of
the
property
he
flew
into
a
rage
and
even
raised
his
hand
against
her
the
poor
woman
kept
repeating
your
brother
has
taken
everything
it
is
understood
that
he
will
take
care
of
at
last
he
left
her
and
ran
off
to
see
pierre
whom
he
had
previously
informed
of
his
return
and
who
was
prepared
to
receive
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
put
an
end
to
the
matter
at
the
first
word
of
abuse
listen
the
said
to
him
affecting
distant
coldness
don
t
rouse
my
anger
or
i
ll
turn
you
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don
t
know
you
we
don
t
bear
the
same
name
it
s
quite
misfortune
enough
for
me
that
my
mother
misconducted
herself
without
having
her
offspring
coming
here
and
insulting
me
i
was
well
disposed
towards
you
but
since
you
are
insolent
i
shall
do
nothing
for
you
absolutely
antoine
was
almost
choking
with
rage
and
what
about
my
money
he
cried
will
you
give
it
up
you
thief
or
shall
i
have
to
drag
you
before
the
judges
pierre
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
ve
got
no
money
of
yours
he
replied
more
calmly
than
ever
my
mother
disposed
of
her
fortune
as
she
thought
proper
i
am
certainly
not
going
to
poke
my
nose
into
her
business
i
willingly
renounced
all
hope
of
inheritance
i
am
quite
safe
from
your
foul
and
as
his
brother
exasperated
by
this
composure
and
not
knowing
what
to
think
muttered
something
pierre
thrust
adelaide
s
receipt
under
his
nose
the
reading
of
this
scrap
of
paper
completed
antoine
s
dismay
very
well
he
said
in
a
calmer
voice
i
know
now
what
i
have
to
the
truth
was
however
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
his
inability
to
hit
upon
any
immediate
expedient
for
obtaining
his
share
of
the
money
and
satisfying
his
desire
of
revenge
increased
his
fury
he
went
back
to
his
mother
and
subjected
her
to
a
disgraceful
the
wretched
woman
could
do
nothing
but
again
refer
him
to
pierre
do
you
think
you
are
going
to
make
me
run
to
and
fro
like
a
shuttle
he
cried
insolently
i
ll
soon
find
out
which
of
you
two
has
the
hoard
you
ve
already
squandered
it
perhaps
and
making
an
allusion
to
her
former
misconduct
he
asked
her
if
there
were
still
not
some
low
fellow
to
whom
she
gave
her
last
sous
he
did
not
even
spare
his
father
that
drunkard
macquart
as
he
called
him
who
must
have
lived
on
her
till
the
day
of
his
death
and
who
left
his
children
in
poverty
the
poor
woman
listened
with
a
stupefied
air
big
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
she
defended
herself
with
the
terror
of
a
child
replying
to
her
son
s
questions
as
though
he
were
a
judge
she
swore
that
she
was
living
respectably
and
reiterated
with
emphasis
that
she
had
never
had
a
sou
of
the
money
that
pierre
had
taken
everything
antoine
almost
came
to
believe
it
at
last
ah
the
scoundrel
he
muttered
that
s
why
he
wouldn
t
purchase
my
he
had
to
sleep
at
his
mother
s
house
on
a
straw
mattress
flung
in
a
corner
he
had
returned
with
his
pockets
perfectly
empty
and
was
exasperated
at
finding
himself
destitute
of
resources
abandoned
like
a
dog
in
the
streets
without
hearth
or
home
while
his
brother
as
he
thought
was
in
a
good
way
of
business
and
living
on
the
fat
of
the
land
as
he
had
no
money
to
buy
clothes
with
he
went
out
on
the
following
day
in
his
regimental
cap
and
trousers
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
find
at
the
bottom
of
a
cupboard
an
old
yellowish
velveteen
jacket
threadbare
and
patched
which
had
belonged
to
macquart
in
this
strange
attire
he
walked
about
the
town
relating
his
story
to
everyone
and
demanding
justice
the
people
whom
he
went
to
consult
received
him
with
a
contempt
which
made
him
shed
tears
of
rage
provincial
folks
are
inexorable
towards
fallen
families
in
the
general
opinion
it
was
only
natural
that
the
should
seek
to
devour
each
other
the
spectators
instead
of
separating
them
were
more
inclined
to
urge
them
on
pierre
however
was
at
that
time
already
beginning
to
purify
himself
of
his
early
stains
people
laughed
at
his
roguery
some
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
had
done
quite
right
if
he
really
had
taken
possession
of
the
money
and
that
it
would
be
a
good
lesson
to
the
dissolute
folks
of
the
town
antoine
returned
home
discouraged
a
lawyer
had
advised
him
in
a
scornful
manner
to
wash
his
dirty
linen
at
home
though
not
until
he
had
skilfully
ascertained
whether
antoine
possessed
the
requisite
means
to
carry
on
a
lawsuit
according
to
this
man
the
case
was
very
involved
the
pleadings
would
be
very
lengthy
and
success
was
doubtful
moreover
it
would
require
money
and
plenty
of
it
antoine
treated
his
mother
yet
more
harshly
that
evening
not
knowing
on
whom
else
to
wreak
his
vengeance
he
repeated
his
accusation
of
the
previous
day
he
kept
the
wretched
woman
up
till
midnight
trembling
with
shame
and
fright
adelaide
having
informed
him
that
pierre
made
her
an
allowance
he
now
felt
certain
that
his
brother
had
pocketed
the
fifty
thousand
francs
but
in
his
irritation
he
still
affected
to
doubt
it
and
did
not
cease
to
question
the
poor
woman
again
and
again
reproaching
her
with
misconduct
antoine
soon
found
out
that
alone
and
without
resources
he
could
not
successfully
carry
on
a
contest
with
his
brother
he
then
endeavoured
to
gain
adelaide
to
his
cause
an
accusation
lodged
by
her
might
have
serious
consequences
but
at
antoine
s
first
suggestion
of
it
the
poor
lazy
lethargic
creature
firmly
refused
to
bring
trouble
on
her
eldest
son
i
am
an
unhappy
woman
she
stammered
it
is
quite
right
of
you
to
get
angry
but
i
should
feel
too
much
remorse
if
i
caused
one
of
my
sons
to
be
sent
to
prison
no
i
d
rather
let
you
beat
he
saw
that
he
would
get
nothing
but
tears
out
of
her
and
contented
himself
with
saying
that
she
was
justly
punished
and
that
he
had
no
pity
for
her
in
the
evening
upset
by
the
continual
quarrels
which
her
son
had
sought
with
her
adelaide
had
one
of
those
nervous
attacks
which
kept
her
as
rigid
as
if
she
had
been
dead
the
young
man
threw
her
on
her
bed
and
then
began
to
rummage
the
house
to
see
if
the
wretched
woman
had
any
savings
hidden
away
he
found
about
forty
francs
he
took
possession
of
them
and
while
his
mother
still
lay
there
rigid
and
scarce
able
to
breathe
he
quietly
took
the
diligence
to
marseilles
he
had
just
bethought
himself
that
mouret
the
journeyman
hatter
who
had
married
his
sister
ursule
must
be
indignant
at
pierre
s
roguery
and
would
no
doubt
be
willing
to
defend
his
wife
s
interests
but
he
did
not
find
in
him
the
man
he
expected
mouret
plainly
told
him
that
he
had
become
accustomed
to
look
upon
ursule
as
an
orphan
and
would
have
no
contentions
with
her
family
at
any
price
their
affairs
were
prospering
antoine
was
received
so
coldly
that
he
hastened
to
take
the
diligence
home
again
but
before
leaving
he
was
anxious
to
revenge
himself
for
the
secret
contempt
which
he
read
in
the
workman
s
eyes
and
observing
that
his
sister
appeared
rather
pale
and
dejected
he
said
to
her
husband
in
a
slyly
cruel
way
as
he
took
his
departure
have
a
care
my
sister
was
always
sickly
and
i
find
her
much
changed
for
the
worse
you
may
lose
her
the
tears
which
rushed
to
mouret
s
eyes
convinced
him
that
he
had
touched
a
sore
wound
but
then
those
made
too
great
a
display
of
their
happiness
when
he
was
back
again
in
plassans
antoine
became
the
more
menacing
from
the
conviction
that
his
hands
were
tied
during
a
whole
month
he
was
seen
all
over
the
place
he
paraded
the
streets
recounting
his
story
to
all
who
would
listen
to
him
whenever
he
succeeded
in
extorting
a
franc
from
his
mother
he
would
drink
it
away
at
some
tavern
where
he
would
revile
his
brother
declaring
that
the
rascal
should
shortly
hear
from
him
in
places
like
these
the
fraternity
which
reigns
among
drunkards
procured
him
a
sympathetic
audience
all
the
scum
of
the
town
espoused
his
cause
and
poured
forth
bitter
imprecations
against
that
rascal
rougon
who
left
a
brave
soldier
to
starve
the
discussion
generally
terminating
with
an
indiscriminate
condemnation
of
the
rich
antoine
the
better
to
revenge
himself
continued
to
march
about
in
his
regimental
cap
and
trousers
and
his
old
yellow
velvet
jacket
although
his
mother
had
offered
to
purchase
some
more
becoming
clothes
for
him
but
no
he
preferred
to
make
a
display
of
his
rags
and
paraded
them
on
sundays
in
the
most
frequented
parts
of
the
cours
sauvaire
one
of
his
most
exquisite
pleasures
was
to
pass
pierre
s
shop
ten
times
a
day
he
would
enlarge
the
holes
in
his
jacket
with
his
fingers
slacken
his
step
and
sometimes
stand
talking
in
front
of
the
door
so
as
to
remain
longer
in
the
street
on
these
occasions
too
he
would
bring
one
of
his
drunken
friends
and
gossip
to
him
telling
him
about
the
theft
of
the
fifty
thousand
francs
accompanying
his
narrative
with
loud
insults
and
menaces
which
could
be
heard
by
everyone
in
the
street
and
taking
particular
care
that
his
abuse
should
reach
the
furthest
end
of
the
shop
he
ll
finish
by
coming
to
beg
in
front
of
our
house
felicite
used
to
say
in
despair
the
vain
little
woman
suffered
terribly
from
this
scandal
she
even
at
this
time
felt
some
regret
at
ever
having
married
rougon
his
family
connections
were
so
objectionable
she
would
have
given
all
she
had
in
the
world
to
prevent
antoine
from
parading
his
rags
but
pierre
who
was
maddened
by
his
brother
s
conduct
would
not
allow
his
name
to
be
mentioned
when
his
wife
tried
to
convince
him
that
it
would
perhaps
be
better
to
free
himself
from
all
annoyance
by
giving
antoine
a
little
money
no
nothing
not
a
sou
he
cried
with
rage
let
him
starve
he
confessed
however
at
last
that
antoine
s
demeanour
was
becoming
intolerable
one
day
felicite
desiring
to
put
an
end
to
it
called
to
that
man
as
she
styled
him
with
a
disdainful
curl
on
her
lip
that
man
was
in
the
act
of
calling
her
a
foul
name
in
the
middle
of
the
street
where
he
stood
with
one
of
his
friends
even
more
ragged
than
himself
they
were
both
drunk
come
they
want
us
in
there
said
antoine
to
his
companion
in
a
jeering
tone
but
felicite
drew
back
muttering
it
s
you
alone
we
wish
to
speak
bah
the
young
man
replied
my
friend
s
a
decent
fellow
you
needn
t
mind
him
hearing
he
ll
be
my
the
witness
sank
heavily
on
a
chair
he
did
not
take
off
his
hat
but
began
to
stare
around
him
with
the
maudlin
stupid
grin
of
drunkards
and
coarse
people
who
know
that
they
are
insolent
felicite
was
so
ashamed
that
she
stood
in
front
of
the
shop
door
in
order
that
people
outside
might
not
see
what
strange
company
she
was
receiving
fortunately
her
husband
came
to
the
rescue
a
violent
quarrel
ensued
between
him
and
his
brother
the
latter
after
stammering
insults
reiterated
his
old
grievances
twenty
times
over
at
last
he
even
began
to
cry
and
his
companion
was
near
following
his
example
pierre
had
defended
himself
in
a
very
dignified
manner
look
here
he
said
at
last
you
re
unfortunate
and
i
pity
you
although
you
have
cruelly
insulted
me
i
can
t
forget
that
we
are
children
of
the
same
mother
if
i
give
you
anything
however
you
must
understand
i
give
it
you
out
of
kindness
and
not
from
fear
would
you
like
a
hundred
francs
to
help
you
out
of
your
difficulties
this
abrupt
offer
of
a
hundred
francs
dazzled
antoine
s
companion
he
looked
at
the
other
with
an
air
of
delight
which
clearly
signified
as
the
gentleman
offers
a
hundred
francs
it
is
time
to
leave
off
abusing
but
antoine
was
determined
to
speculate
on
his
brother
s
favourable
disposition
he
asked
him
whether
he
took
him
for
a
fool
it
was
his
share
ten
thousand
francs
that
he
wanted
you
re
wrong
you
re
wrong
stuttered
his
friend
at
last
as
pierre
losing
all
patience
was
threatening
to
turn
them
both
out
antoine
lowered
his
demands
and
contented
himself
with
claiming
one
thousand
francs
they
quarrelled
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
over
this
amount
finally
felicite
interfered
a
crowd
was
gathering
round
the
shop
listen
she
said
excitedly
my
husband
will
give
you
two
hundred
francs
i
ll
undertake
to
buy
you
a
suit
of
clothes
and
hire
a
room
for
a
year
for
rougon
got
angry
at
this
but
antoine
s
comrade
cried
with
transports
of
delight
all
right
it
s
settled
then
my
friend
antoine
did
in
fact
declare
in
a
surly
way
that
he
would
accept
he
felt
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
any
more
it
was
arranged
that
the
money
and
clothes
should
be
sent
to
him
on
the
following
day
and
that
a
few
days
later
as
soon
as
felicite
should
have
found
a
room
for
him
he
would
take
up
his
quarters
there
as
they
were
leaving
the
young
man
s
sottish
companion
became
as
respectful
as
he
had
previously
been
insolent
he
bowed
to
the
company
more
than
a
dozen
times
in
an
awkward
and
humble
manner
muttering
many
indistinct
thanks
as
if
the
rougons
gifts
had
been
intended
for
himself
a
week
later
antoine
occupied
a
large
room
in
the
old
quarter
in
which
felicite
exceeding
her
promises
had
placed
a
bed
a
table
and
some
chairs
on
the
young
man
formally
undertaking
not
to
molest
them
in
future
adelaide
felt
no
regret
at
her
son
leaving
her
the
short
stay
he
had
made
with
her
had
condemned
her
to
bread
and
water
for
more
than
three
months
however
antoine
had
soon
eaten
and
drunk
the
two
hundred
francs
he
received
from
pierre
he
never
for
a
moment
thought
of
investing
them
in
some
little
business
which
would
have
helped
him
to
live
when
he
was
again
penniless
having
no
trade
and
being
moreover
unwilling
to
work
he
again
sought
to
slip
a
hand
into
the
rougons
purse
circumstances
were
not
the
same
as
before
however
and
he
failed
to
intimidate
them
pierre
even
took
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
turn
him
out
and
forbade
him
ever
to
set
foot
in
his
house
again
it
was
of
no
avail
for
antoine
to
repeat
his
former
accusations
the
townspeople
who
were
acquainted
with
his
brother
s
munificence
from
the
publicity
which
felicite
had
given
to
it
declared
him
to
be
in
the
wrong
and
called
him
a
lazy
idle
fellow
meantime
his
hunger
was
pressing
he
threatened
to
turn
smuggler
like
his
father
and
perpetrate
some
crime
which
would
dishonour
his
family
at
this
the
rougons
shrugged
their
shoulders
they
knew
he
was
too
much
of
a
coward
to
risk
his
neck
at
last
blindly
enraged
against
his
relatives
in
particular
and
society
in
general
antoine
made
up
his
mind
to
seek
some
work
in
a
tavern
of
the
faubourg
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
who
worked
at
home
he
offered
to
help
him
in
a
short
time
he
learnt
to
plait
baskets
and
hampers
a
coarse
and
kind
of
labour
which
finds
a
ready
market
he
was
very
soon
able
to
work
on
his
own
account
this
trade
pleased
him
as
it
was
not
over
laborious
he
could
still
indulge
his
idleness
and
that
was
what
he
chiefly
cared
for
he
would
only
take
to
his
work
when
he
could
no
longer
do
otherwise
then
he
would
hurriedly
plait
a
dozen
baskets
and
go
and
sell
them
in
the
market
as
long
as
the
money
lasted
he
lounged
about
visiting
all
the
taverns
and
digesting
his
drink
in
the
sunshine
then
when
he
had
fasted
a
whole
day
he
would
once
more
take
up
his
osier
with
a
low
growl
and
revile
the
wealthy
who
lived
in
idleness
the
trade
of
a
when
followed
in
such
a
manner
is
a
thankless
one
antoine
s
work
would
not
have
sufficed
to
pay
for
his
drinking
bouts
if
he
had
not
contrived
a
means
of
procuring
his
osier
at
low
cost
he
never
bought
any
at
plassans
but
used
to
say
that
he
went
each
month
to
purchase
a
stock
at
a
neighbouring
town
where
he
pretended
it
was
sold
cheaper
the
truth
however
was
that
he
supplied
himself
from
the
of
the
viorne
on
dark
nights
a
rural
policeman
even
caught
him
once
in
the
very
act
and
antoine
underwent
a
few
days
imprisonment
in
consequence
it
was
from
that
time
forward
that
he
posed
in
the
town
as
a
fierce
republican
he
declared
that
he
had
been
quietly
smoking
his
pipe
by
the
riverside
when
the
rural
policeman
arrested
him
and
he
added
they
would
like
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
because
they
know
what
my
opinions
are
but
i
m
not
afraid
of
them
those
rich
at
last
at
the
end
of
ten
years
of
idleness
antoine
considered
that
he
had
been
working
too
hard
his
constant
dream
was
to
devise
some
expedient
by
which
he
might
live
at
his
ease
without
having
to
do
anything
his
idleness
would
never
have
rested
content
with
bread
and
water
he
was
not
like
certain
lazy
persons
who
are
willing
to
put
up
with
hunger
provided
they
can
keep
their
hands
in
their
pockets
he
liked
good
feeding
and
nothing
to
do
he
talked
at
one
time
of
taking
a
situation
as
servant
in
some
nobleman
s
house
in
the
quarter
but
one
of
his
friends
a
groom
frightened
him
by
describing
the
exacting
ways
of
his
masters
finally
macquart
sick
of
his
baskets
and
seeing
the
time
approach
when
he
would
be
compelled
to
purchase
the
requisite
osier
was
on
the
point
of
selling
himself
as
an
army
substitute
and
resuming
his
military
life
which
he
preferred
a
thousand
times
to
that
of
an
artisan
when
he
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
woman
an
acquaintance
which
modified
his
plans
josephine
gavaudan
who
was
known
throughout
the
town
by
the
familiar
diminutive
of
fine
was
a
tall
strapping
wench
of
about
thirty
with
a
square
face
of
masculine
proportions
and
a
few
terribly
long
hairs
about
her
chin
and
lips
she
was
cited
as
a
doughty
woman
one
who
could
make
the
weight
of
her
fist
felt
her
broad
shoulders
and
huge
arms
consequently
inspired
the
town
urchins
with
marvellous
respect
and
they
did
not
even
dare
to
smile
at
her
moustache
notwithstanding
all
this
fine
had
a
faint
voice
weak
and
clear
like
that
of
a
child
those
who
were
acquainted
with
her
asserted
that
she
was
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
in
spite
of
her
formidable
appearance
as
she
was
very
she
might
have
put
some
money
aside
if
she
had
not
had
a
partiality
for
liqueurs
she
adored
aniseed
and
very
often
had
to
be
carried
home
on
sunday
evenings
on
week
days
she
would
toil
with
the
stubbornness
of
an
animal
she
had
three
or
four
different
occupations
she
sold
fruit
or
boiled
chestnuts
in
the
market
according
to
the
season
went
out
charring
for
a
few
people
washed
up
plates
and
dishes
at
houses
when
parties
were
given
and
employed
her
spare
time
in
mending
old
chairs
she
was
more
particularly
known
in
the
town
as
a
in
the
south
large
numbers
of
chairs
are
used
antoine
macquart
formed
an
acquaintance
with
fine
at
the
market
when
he
went
to
sell
his
baskets
in
the
winter
he
would
stand
beside
the
stove
on
which
she
cooled
her
chestnuts
and
warm
himself
he
was
astonished
at
her
courage
he
who
was
frightened
of
the
least
work
by
degrees
he
discerned
beneath
the
apparent
roughness
of
this
strapping
creature
signs
of
timidity
and
kindliness
he
frequently
saw
her
give
handfuls
of
chestnuts
to
the
ragged
urchins
who
stood
in
ecstasy
round
her
smoking
pot
at
other
times
when
the
market
inspector
hustled
her
she
very
nearly
began
to
cry
apparently
forgetting
all
about
her
heavy
fists
antoine
at
last
decided
that
she
was
exactly
the
woman
he
wanted
she
would
work
for
both
and
he
would
lay
down
the
law
at
home
she
would
be
his
beast
of
burden
an
obedient
indefatigable
animal
as
for
her
partiality
for
liqueurs
he
regarded
this
as
quite
natural
after
well
weighing
the
advantages
of
such
an
union
he
declared
himself
to
fine
who
was
delighted
with
his
proposal
no
man
had
ever
yet
ventured
to
propose
to
her
though
she
was
told
that
antoine
was
the
most
worthless
of
vagabonds
she
lacked
the
courage
to
refuse
matrimony
the
very
evening
of
the
nuptials
the
young
man
took
up
his
abode
in
his
wife
s
lodgings
in
the
rue
civadiere
near
the
market
these
lodgings
consisting
of
three
rooms
were
much
more
comfortably
furnished
than
his
own
and
he
gave
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
as
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
two
excellent
mattresses
which
covered
the
bedstead
everything
went
on
very
well
for
the
first
few
days
fine
attended
to
her
various
occupations
as
in
the
past
antoine
seized
with
a
sort
of
marital
which
astonished
even
himself
plaited
in
one
week
more
baskets
than
he
had
ever
before
done
in
a
month
on
the
first
sunday
however
war
broke
out
the
couple
had
a
goodly
sum
of
money
in
the
house
and
they
spent
it
freely
during
the
night
when
they
were
both
drunk
they
beat
each
other
outrageously
without
being
able
to
remember
on
the
morrow
how
it
was
that
the
quarrel
had
commenced
they
had
remained
on
most
affectionate
terms
until
about
ten
o
clock
when
antoine
had
begun
to
beat
fine
brutally
whereupon
the
latter
growing
exasperated
and
forgetting
her
meekness
had
given
him
back
as
much
as
she
received
she
went
to
work
again
bravely
on
the
following
day
as
though
nothing
had
happened
but
her
husband
with
sullen
rancour
rose
late
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
day
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
sunshine
from
that
time
forward
the
macquarts
adopted
the
kind
of
life
which
they
were
destined
to
lead
in
the
future
it
became
as
it
were
tacitly
understood
between
them
that
the
wife
should
toil
and
moil
to
keep
her
husband
fine
who
had
an
instinctive
liking
for
work
did
not
object
to
this
she
was
as
patient
as
a
saint
provided
she
had
had
no
drink
thought
it
quite
natural
that
her
husband
should
remain
idle
and
even
strove
to
spare
him
the
most
trifling
labour
her
little
weakness
aniseed
did
not
make
her
vicious
but
just
on
the
evenings
when
she
had
forgotten
herself
in
the
company
of
a
bottle
of
her
favourite
liqueur
if
antoine
tried
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
her
she
would
set
upon
him
with
might
and
main
reproaching
him
with
his
idleness
and
ingratitude
the
neighbours
grew
accustomed
to
the
disturbances
which
periodically
broke
out
in
the
couple
s
room
the
two
battered
each
other
conscientiously
the
wife
slapped
like
a
mother
chastising
a
naughty
child
but
the
husband
treacherous
and
spiteful
as
he
was
measured
his
blows
and
on
several
occasions
very
nearly
crippled
the
unfortunate
woman
you
ll
be
in
a
fine
plight
when
you
ve
broken
one
of
my
arms
or
legs
she
would
say
to
him
who
ll
keep
you
then
you
lazy
fellow
excepting
for
these
turbulent
scenes
antoine
began
to
find
his
new
mode
of
existence
quite
endurable
he
was
well
clothed
and
ate
and
drank
his
fill
he
had
laid
aside
the
basket
work
altogether
sometimes
when
he
was
feeling
he
would
resolve
to
plait
a
dozen
baskets
for
the
next
market
day
but
very
often
he
did
not
even
finish
the
first
one
he
kept
under
a
couch
a
bundle
of
osier
which
he
did
not
use
up
in
twenty
years
the
macquarts
had
three
children
two
girls
and
a
boy
lisa
born
the
first
in
one
year
after
the
marriage
remained
but
little
at
home
she
was
a
fine
big
healthy
child
greatly
resembling
her
mother
she
did
not
however
inherit
the
latter
s
animal
devotion
and
endurance
macquart
had
implanted
in
her
a
most
decided
longing
for
ease
and
comfort
while
she
was
a
child
she
would
consent
to
work
for
a
whole
day
in
return
for
a
cake
when
she
was
scarcely
seven
years
old
the
wife
of
the
postmaster
who
was
a
neighbour
of
the
macquarts
took
a
liking
to
her
she
made
a
little
maid
of
her
and
when
she
lost
her
husband
in
and
went
to
live
in
paris
she
took
lisa
with
her
the
parents
had
almost
given
her
their
daughter
the
s
wife
in
ventre
de
fat
and
the
the
second
girl
gervaise
born
the
following
year
was
a
cripple
from
birth
her
right
thigh
was
smaller
than
the
left
and
showed
signs
of
curvature
a
curious
hereditary
result
of
the
brutality
which
her
mother
had
to
endure
during
her
fierce
drunken
brawls
with
macquart
gervaise
remained
puny
and
fine
observing
her
pallor
and
weakness
put
her
on
a
course
of
aniseed
under
the
pretext
that
she
required
something
to
strengthen
her
but
the
poor
child
became
still
more
emaciated
she
was
a
tall
lank
girl
whose
frocks
invariably
too
large
hung
round
her
as
if
they
had
nothing
under
them
above
a
deformed
and
puny
body
she
had
a
sweet
little
head
a
tiny
round
face
pale
and
exquisitely
delicate
her
infirmity
almost
became
graceful
her
body
swayed
gently
at
every
step
with
a
sort
of
rhythmical
swing
the
chief
female
character
in
the
macquarts
son
jean
was
born
three
years
later
he
was
a
robust
child
in
no
respect
recalling
gervaise
like
the
eldest
girl
he
took
after
his
mother
without
having
any
physical
resemblance
to
her
he
was
the
first
to
import
into
the
stock
a
fat
face
with
regular
features
which
showed
all
the
coldness
of
a
grave
yet
not
nature
this
boy
grew
up
with
the
determination
of
some
day
making
an
independent
position
for
himself
he
attended
school
diligently
and
tortured
his
dull
brain
to
force
a
little
arithmetic
and
spelling
into
it
after
that
he
became
an
apprentice
repeating
much
the
same
efforts
with
a
perseverance
that
was
the
more
meritorious
as
it
took
him
a
whole
day
to
learn
what
others
acquired
in
an
hour
figures
prominently
in
and
as
long
as
these
poor
little
things
remained
a
burden
to
the
house
antoine
grumbled
they
were
useless
mouths
that
lessened
his
own
share
he
vowed
like
his
brother
that
he
would
have
no
more
children
those
greedy
creatures
who
bring
their
parents
to
penury
it
was
something
to
hear
him
bemoan
his
lot
when
they
sat
five
at
table
and
the
mother
gave
the
best
morsels
to
jean
lisa
and
gervaise
that
s
right
he
would
growl
stuff
them
make
them
burst
whenever
fine
bought
a
garment
or
a
pair
of
boots
for
them
he
would
sulk
for
days
together
ah
if
he
had
only
known
he
would
never
had
had
that
pack
of
brats
who
compelled
him
to
limit
his
smoking
to
four
sous
worth
of
tobacco
a
day
and
too
frequently
obliged
him
to
eat
stewed
potatoes
for
dinner
a
dish
which
he
heartily
detested
later
on
however
as
soon
as
jean
and
gervaise
earned
their
first
francs
he
found
some
good
in
children
after
all
lisa
was
no
longer
there
he
lived
upon
the
earnings
of
the
two
others
without
compunction
as
he
had
already
lived
upon
their
mother
it
was
a
speculation
on
his
part
as
soon
as
little
gervaise
was
eight
years
old
she
went
to
a
neighbouring
dealer
s
to
crack
almonds
she
there
earned
ten
sous
a
day
which
her
father
pocketed
right
royally
without
even
a
question
from
fine
as
to
what
became
of
the
money
the
young
girl
was
next
apprenticed
to
a
laundress
and
as
soon
as
she
received
two
francs
a
day
for
her
work
the
two
francs
strayed
in
a
similar
manner
into
macquart
s
hands
jean
who
had
learnt
the
trade
of
a
carpenter
was
likewise
despoiled
on
whenever
macquart
succeeded
in
catching
him
before
he
had
handed
the
money
to
his
mother
if
the
money
escaped
macquart
which
sometimes
happened
he
became
frightfully
surly
he
would
glare
at
his
wife
and
children
for
a
whole
week
picking
a
quarrel
for
nothing
although
he
was
as
yet
ashamed
to
confess
the
real
cause
of
his
irritations
on
the
next
however
he
would
station
himself
on
the
watch
and
as
soon
as
he
had
succeeded
in
pilfering
the
youngster
s
earnings
he
disappeared
for
days
together
gervaise
beaten
and
brought
up
in
the
streets
among
all
the
lads
of
the
neighbourhood
became
a
mother
when
she
was
fourteen
years
of
age
the
father
of
her
child
was
not
eighteen
years
old
he
was
a
journeyman
tanner
named
lantier
at
first
macquart
was
furious
but
he
calmed
down
somewhat
when
he
learnt
that
lantier
s
mother
a
worthy
woman
was
willing
to
take
charge
of
the
child
he
kept
gervaise
however
she
was
then
already
earning
sous
a
day
and
he
therefore
avoided
all
question
of
marriage
four
years
later
she
had
a
second
child
which
was
likewise
taken
in
by
lantier
s
mother
this
time
macquart
shut
his
eyes
altogether
and
when
fine
timidly
suggested
that
it
was
time
to
come
to
some
understanding
with
the
tanner
in
order
to
end
a
state
of
things
which
made
people
chatter
he
flatly
declared
that
his
daughter
should
not
leave
him
and
that
he
would
give
her
to
her
lover
later
on
when
he
was
worthy
of
her
and
had
enough
money
to
furnish
a
this
was
a
fine
time
for
antoine
macquart
he
dressed
like
a
gentleman
in
and
trousers
of
the
finest
cloth
cleanly
shaved
and
almost
fat
he
was
no
longer
the
emaciated
ragged
vagabond
who
had
been
wont
to
frequent
the
taverns
he
dropped
into
cafes
read
the
papers
and
strolled
on
the
cours
sauvaire
he
played
the
gentleman
as
long
as
he
had
any
money
in
his
pocket
at
times
of
impecuniosity
he
remained
at
home
exasperated
at
being
kept
in
his
hovel
and
prevented
from
taking
his
customary
cup
of
coffee
on
such
occasions
he
would
reproach
the
whole
human
race
with
his
poverty
making
himself
ill
with
rage
and
envy
until
fine
out
of
pity
would
often
give
him
the
last
silver
coin
in
the
house
so
that
he
might
spend
his
evening
at
the
cafe
this
dear
fellow
was
fiercely
selfish
gervaise
who
brought
home
as
much
as
sixty
francs
a
month
wore
only
thin
cotton
frocks
while
he
had
black
satin
waistcoats
made
for
him
by
one
of
the
best
tailors
in
plassans
jean
the
big
lad
who
earned
three
or
four
francs
a
day
was
perhaps
robbed
even
more
impudently
the
cafe
where
his
father
passed
entire
days
was
just
opposite
his
master
s
workshop
and
while
he
had
plane
or
saw
in
hand
he
could
see
monsieur
macquart
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
sweetening
his
coffee
or
playing
piquet
with
some
petty
annuitant
it
was
his
money
that
the
lazy
old
fellow
was
gambling
away
he
jean
never
stepped
inside
a
cafe
he
never
had
so
much
as
five
sous
to
pay
for
a
drink
antoine
treated
him
like
a
little
girl
never
leaving
him
a
centime
and
always
demanding
an
exact
account
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
employed
his
time
if
the
unfortunate
lad
led
away
by
some
of
his
mates
wasted
a
day
somewhere
in
the
country
on
the
banks
of
the
viorne
or
on
the
slopes
of
garrigues
his
father
would
storm
and
raise
his
hand
and
long
bear
him
a
grudge
on
account
of
the
four
francs
less
that
he
received
at
the
end
of
the
fortnight
he
thus
held
his
son
in
a
state
of
dependence
sometimes
even
looking
upon
the
sweethearts
whom
the
young
carpenter
courted
as
his
own
several
of
gervaise
s
friends
used
to
come
to
the
macquarts
house
from
sixteen
to
eighteen
years
of
age
bold
and
boisterous
girls
who
on
certain
evenings
filled
the
room
with
youth
and
gaiety
poor
jean
deprived
of
all
pleasure
ever
kept
at
home
by
the
lack
of
money
looked
at
these
girls
with
longing
eyes
but
the
childish
life
which
he
was
compelled
to
lead
had
implanted
invincible
shyness
in
him
in
playing
with
his
sister
s
friends
he
was
hardly
bold
enough
to
touch
them
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
macquart
used
to
shrug
his
shoulders
with
pity
what
a
simpleton
he
would
mutter
with
an
air
of
ironical
superiority
and
it
was
he
who
would
kiss
the
girls
when
his
wife
s
back
was
turned
he
carried
his
attentions
even
further
with
a
little
laundress
whom
jean
pursued
rather
more
earnestly
than
the
others
one
fine
evening
he
stole
her
almost
from
his
arms
the
old
rogue
prided
himself
on
his
gallantry
there
are
some
men
who
live
upon
their
mistresses
antoine
macquart
lived
on
his
wife
and
children
with
as
much
shamelessness
and
impudence
he
did
not
feel
the
least
compunction
in
pillaging
the
home
and
going
out
to
enjoy
himself
when
the
house
was
bare
he
still
assumed
a
supercilious
air
returning
from
the
cafe
only
to
rail
against
the
poverty
and
wretchedness
that
awaited
him
at
home
he
found
the
dinner
detestable
he
called
gervaise
a
blockhead
and
declared
that
jean
would
never
be
a
man
immersed
in
his
own
selfish
indulgence
he
rubbed
his
hands
whenever
he
had
eaten
the
best
piece
in
the
dish
and
then
he
smoked
his
pipe
puffing
slowly
while
the
two
poor
children
overcome
with
fatigue
went
to
sleep
with
their
heads
resting
on
the
table
thus
macquart
passed
his
days
in
lazy
enjoyment
it
seemed
to
him
quite
natural
that
he
should
be
kept
in
idleness
like
a
girl
to
sprawl
about
on
the
benches
of
some
tavern
or
stroll
in
the
cool
of
the
day
along
the
cours
or
the
mail
at
last
he
went
so
far
as
to
relate
his
amorous
escapades
in
the
presence
of
his
son
who
listened
with
glistening
eyes
the
children
never
protested
accustomed
as
they
were
to
see
their
mother
humble
herself
before
her
husband
fine
that
strapping
woman
who
drubbed
him
soundly
when
they
were
both
intoxicated
always
trembled
before
him
when
she
was
sober
and
allowed
him
to
rule
despotically
at
home
he
robbed
her
in
the
night
of
the
coppers
which
she
had
earned
during
the
day
at
the
market
but
she
never
dared
to
protest
except
by
veiled
rebukes
sometimes
when
he
had
squandered
the
week
s
money
in
advance
he
accused
her
poor
thing
who
worked
herself
to
death
of
being
stupid
and
not
knowing
how
to
manage
fine
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
replied
in
her
soft
clear
voice
which
contrasted
so
strangely
with
her
big
figure
that
she
was
no
longer
twenty
years
old
and
that
money
was
becoming
hard
to
earn
in
order
to
console
herself
she
would
buy
a
pint
of
aniseed
and
drink
little
glassfuls
of
it
with
her
daughter
of
an
evening
after
antoine
had
gone
back
to
the
cafe
that
was
their
dissipation
jean
went
to
bed
while
the
two
women
remained
at
the
table
listening
attentively
in
order
to
remove
the
bottle
and
glasses
at
the
first
sound
when
macquart
was
late
they
often
became
intoxicated
by
the
many
nips
they
thus
thoughtlessly
imbibed
stupefied
and
gazing
at
each
other
with
vague
smiles
this
mother
and
daughter
would
end
by
stuttering
red
patches
appeared
on
gervaise
s
cheeks
her
delicate
face
assumed
a
look
of
maudlin
beatitude
nothing
could
be
more
than
to
see
this
wretched
pale
child
aglow
with
drink
and
wearing
the
idiotic
smile
of
a
confirmed
sot
about
her
moist
lips
fine
huddled
up
on
her
chair
became
heavy
and
drowsy
they
sometimes
forgot
to
keep
watch
or
even
lacked
the
strength
to
remove
the
bottle
and
glasses
when
antoine
s
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
on
these
occasions
blows
were
freely
exchanged
among
the
macquarts
jean
had
to
get
up
to
separate
his
father
and
mother
and
make
his
sister
go
to
bed
as
otherwise
she
would
have
slept
on
the
floor
every
political
party
numbers
its
grotesques
and
its
villains
antoine
macquart
devoured
by
envy
and
hatred
and
meditating
revenge
against
society
in
general
welcomed
the
republic
as
a
happy
era
when
he
would
be
allowed
to
fill
his
pockets
from
his
neighbour
s
and
even
strangle
the
neighbour
if
the
latter
manifested
any
displeasure
his
cafe
life
and
all
the
newspaper
articles
he
had
read
without
understanding
them
had
made
him
a
terrible
ranter
who
enunciated
the
strangest
of
political
theories
it
is
necessary
to
have
heard
one
of
those
malcontents
who
ill
digest
what
they
read
haranguing
the
company
in
some
provincial
taproom
in
order
to
conceive
the
degree
of
hateful
folly
at
which
macquart
had
arrived
as
he
talked
a
good
deal
had
seen
active
service
and
was
naturally
regarded
as
a
man
of
energy
and
spirit
he
was
much
sought
after
and
listened
to
by
simpletons
although
he
was
not
the
chief
of
any
party
he
had
succeeded
in
collecting
round
him
a
small
group
of
who
took
his
jealous
ravings
for
expressions
of
honest
and
conscientious
indignation
directly
after
the
revolution
of
february
he
persuaded
himself
that
plassans
was
his
own
and
as
he
strolled
along
the
streets
the
jeering
manner
in
which
he
regarded
the
little
retail
traders
who
stood
terrified
at
their
shop
doors
clearly
signified
our
day
has
come
my
little
lambs
we
are
going
to
lead
you
a
fine
dance
he
had
grown
insolent
beyond
belief
he
acted
the
part
of
a
victorious
despot
to
such
a
degree
that
he
ceased
to
pay
for
his
drinks
at
the
cafe
and
the
landlord
a
simpleton
who
trembled
whenever
antoine
rolled
his
eyes
dared
not
present
his
bill
the
number
of
cups
of
coffee
he
consumed
during
this
period
was
incalculable
sometimes
he
invited
his
friends
and
shouted
for
hours
together
that
the
people
were
dying
of
hunger
and
that
the
rich
ought
to
share
their
wealth
with
them
he
himself
would
never
have
given
a
sou
to
a
beggar
that
which
chiefly
converted
him
into
a
fierce
republican
was
the
hope
of
at
last
being
able
to
revenge
himself
on
the
rougons
who
had
openly
ranged
themselves
on
the
side
of
the
reactionary
party
ah
what
a
triumph
if
he
could
only
hold
pierre
and
felicite
at
his
mercy
although
the
latter
had
not
succeeded
over
well
in
business
they
had
at
last
become
gentlefolks
while
he
macquart
had
still
remained
a
that
exasperated
him
perhaps
he
was
still
more
mortified
because
one
of
their
sons
was
a
barrister
another
a
doctor
and
the
third
a
clerk
while
his
son
jean
merely
worked
at
a
carpenter
s
shop
and
his
daughter
gervaise
at
a
washerwoman
s
when
he
compared
the
macquarts
with
the
rougons
he
was
still
more
ashamed
to
see
his
wife
selling
chestnuts
in
the
market
and
mending
the
greasy
old
chairs
of
the
neighbourhood
in
the
evening
pierre
after
all
was
but
his
brother
and
had
no
more
right
than
himself
to
live
fatly
on
his
income
moreover
this
brother
was
actually
playing
the
gentleman
with
money
stolen
from
him
whenever
macquart
touched
upon
this
subject
he
became
fiercely
enraged
he
clamoured
for
hours
together
incessantly
repeating
his
old
accusations
and
never
wearying
of
exclaiming
if
my
brother
was
where
he
ought
to
be
i
should
be
the
moneyed
man
at
the
present
time
and
when
anyone
asked
him
where
his
brother
ought
to
be
he
would
reply
at
the
galleys
in
a
formidable
voice
his
hatred
further
increased
when
the
rougons
had
gathered
the
conservatives
round
them
and
thus
acquired
a
certain
influence
in
plassans
the
famous
yellow
became
in
his
chatter
at
the
cafe
a
cave
of
bandits
an
assembly
of
villains
who
every
evening
swore
on
their
daggers
that
they
would
murder
the
people
in
order
to
incite
the
starvelings
against
pierre
macquart
went
so
far
as
to
circulate
a
report
that
the
retired
was
not
so
poor
as
he
pretended
but
that
he
concealed
his
treasures
through
avarice
and
fear
of
robbery
his
tactics
thus
tended
to
rouse
the
poor
people
by
a
repetition
of
absurdly
ridiculous
tales
which
he
often
came
to
believe
in
himself
his
personal
animosity
and
his
desire
for
revenge
were
ill
concealed
beneath
his
professions
of
patriotism
but
he
was
heard
so
frequently
and
he
had
such
a
loud
voice
that
no
one
would
have
dared
to
doubt
the
genuineness
of
his
convictions
at
bottom
all
the
members
of
this
family
had
the
same
brutish
passions
felicite
who
clearly
understood
that
macquart
s
wild
theories
were
simply
the
fruit
of
restrained
rage
and
embittered
envy
would
much
have
liked
to
purchase
his
silence
unfortunately
she
was
short
of
money
and
did
not
dare
to
interest
him
in
the
dangerous
game
which
her
husband
was
playing
antoine
now
injured
them
very
much
among
the
people
of
the
new
town
it
sufficed
that
he
was
a
relation
of
theirs
granoux
and
roudier
often
scornfully
reproached
them
for
having
such
a
man
in
their
family
felicite
consequently
asked
herself
with
anguish
how
they
could
manage
to
cleanse
themselves
of
such
a
stain
it
seemed
to
her
monstrous
and
indecent
that
monsieur
rougon
should
have
a
brother
whose
wife
sold
chestnuts
and
who
himself
lived
in
crapulous
idleness
she
at
last
even
trembled
for
the
success
of
their
secret
intrigues
so
long
as
antoine
seemingly
took
pleasure
in
compromising
them
when
the
diatribes
which
he
levelled
at
the
yellow
were
reported
to
her
she
shuddered
at
the
thought
that
he
was
capable
of
becoming
desperate
and
ruining
all
their
hopes
by
force
of
scandal
antoine
knew
what
consternation
his
demeanour
must
cause
the
rougons
and
it
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
exhausting
their
patience
that
he
from
day
to
day
affected
fiercer
opinions
at
the
cafe
he
frequented
he
used
to
speak
of
my
brother
pierre
in
a
voice
which
made
everybody
turn
round
and
if
he
happened
to
meet
some
reactionary
from
the
yellow
in
the
street
he
would
mutter
some
low
abuse
which
the
worthy
citizen
amazed
at
such
audacity
would
repeat
to
the
rougons
in
the
evening
as
though
to
make
them
responsible
for
his
disagreeable
encounter
one
day
granoux
arrived
in
a
state
of
fury
really
he
exclaimed
when
scarcely
across
the
threshold
it
s
intolerable
one
can
t
move
a
step
without
being
then
addressing
pierre
he
added
when
one
has
a
brother
like
yours
sir
one
should
rid
society
of
him
i
was
just
quietly
walking
past
the
when
that
rascal
passed
me
muttering
something
in
which
i
could
clearly
distinguish
the
words
old
felicite
turned
pale
and
felt
it
necessary
to
apologise
to
granoux
but
he
refused
to
accept
any
excuses
and
threatened
to
leave
altogether
the
marquis
however
exerted
himself
to
arrange
matters
it
is
very
strange
he
said
that
the
wretched
fellow
should
have
called
you
an
old
rogue
are
you
sure
that
he
intended
the
insult
for
you
granoux
was
perplexed
he
admitted
at
last
however
that
antoine
might
have
muttered
so
you
are
again
going
to
that
old
rogue
s
at
this
monsieur
de
carnavant
stroked
his
chin
to
conceal
the
smile
which
rose
to
his
lips
in
spite
of
himself
then
rougon
with
superb
composure
replied
i
thought
as
much
the
old
rogue
was
no
doubt
intended
for
me
i
ve
very
glad
that
this
misunderstanding
is
now
cleared
up
gentlemen
pray
avoid
the
man
in
question
whom
i
formally
felicite
however
did
not
take
matters
so
coolly
every
fresh
scandal
caused
by
macquart
made
her
more
and
more
uneasy
she
would
sometimes
pass
the
whole
night
wondering
what
those
gentlemen
must
think
of
the
matter
a
few
months
before
the
coup
d
etat
the
rougons
received
an
anonymous
letter
three
pages
of
foul
insults
in
which
they
were
warned
that
if
their
party
should
ever
triumph
the
scandalous
story
of
adelaide
s
amours
would
be
published
in
some
newspaper
together
with
an
account
of
the
robbery
perpetrated
by
pierre
when
he
had
compelled
his
mother
driven
out
of
her
senses
by
debauchery
to
sign
a
receipt
for
fifty
thousand
francs
this
letter
was
a
heavy
blow
for
rougon
himself
felicite
could
not
refrain
from
reproaching
her
husband
with
his
disreputable
family
for
the
husband
and
wife
never
for
a
moment
doubted
that
this
letter
was
antoine
s
work
we
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
the
blackguard
at
any
price
said
pierre
in
a
gloomy
tone
he
s
becoming
too
troublesome
by
in
the
meantime
macquart
resorting
to
his
former
tactics
looked
round
among
his
own
relatives
for
accomplices
who
would
join
him
against
the
rougons
he
had
counted
upon
aristide
at
first
on
reading
his
terrible
articles
in
the
but
the
young
man
in
spite
of
all
his
jealous
rage
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
make
common
cause
with
such
a
fellow
as
his
uncle
he
never
even
minced
matters
with
him
but
invariably
kept
him
at
a
distance
a
circumstance
which
induced
antoine
to
regard
him
suspiciously
in
the
taverns
where
macquart
reigned
supreme
people
went
so
far
as
to
say
the
journalist
was
paid
to
provoke
disturbances
baffled
on
this
side
macquart
had
no
alternative
but
to
sound
his
sister
ursule
s
children
ursule
had
died
in
thus
fulfilling
her
brother
s
evil
prophecy
the
nervous
affection
which
she
had
inherited
from
her
mother
had
turned
into
slow
consumption
which
gradually
killed
her
she
left
three
children
a
daughter
eighteen
years
of
age
named
helene
who
married
a
clerk
and
two
boys
the
elder
francois
a
young
man
of
and
the
younger
a
sickly
little
fellow
scarcely
six
years
old
named
silvere
the
death
of
his
wife
whom
he
adored
proved
a
thunderbolt
to
mouret
he
dragged
on
his
existence
for
another
year
neglecting
his
business
and
losing
all
the
money
he
had
saved
then
one
morning
he
was
found
hanging
in
a
cupboard
where
ursule
s
dresses
were
still
suspended
his
elder
son
who
had
received
a
good
commercial
training
took
a
situation
in
the
house
of
his
uncle
rougon
where
he
replaced
aristide
who
had
just
left
rougon
in
spite
of
his
profound
hatred
for
the
macquarts
gladly
welcomed
this
nephew
whom
he
knew
to
be
industrious
and
sober
he
was
in
want
of
a
youth
whom
he
could
trust
and
who
would
help
him
to
retrieve
his
affairs
moreover
during
the
time
of
mouret
s
prosperity
he
had
learnt
to
esteem
the
young
couple
who
knew
how
to
make
money
and
thus
he
had
soon
become
reconciled
with
his
sister
perhaps
he
thought
he
was
making
francois
some
compensation
by
taking
him
into
his
business
having
robbed
the
mother
he
would
shield
himself
from
remorse
by
giving
employment
to
the
son
even
rogues
make
honest
calculations
sometimes
it
was
however
a
good
thing
for
him
if
the
house
of
rougon
did
not
make
a
fortune
at
this
time
it
was
certainly
through
no
fault
of
that
quiet
punctilious
youth
francois
who
seemed
born
to
pass
his
life
behind
a
grocer
s
counter
between
a
jar
of
oil
and
a
bundle
of
dried
although
he
physically
resembled
his
mother
he
inherited
from
his
father
a
just
if
narrow
mind
with
an
instinctive
liking
for
a
methodical
life
and
the
safe
speculations
of
a
small
business
three
months
after
his
arrival
pierre
pursuing
his
system
of
compensation
married
him
to
his
young
daughter
marthe
whom
he
did
not
know
how
to
dispose
of
the
two
young
people
fell
in
love
with
each
other
quite
suddenly
in
a
few
days
a
peculiar
circumstance
had
doubtless
determined
and
enhanced
their
mutual
affection
there
was
a
remarkably
close
resemblance
between
them
suggesting
that
of
brother
and
sister
francois
inherited
through
ursule
the
face
of
his
grandmother
adelaide
marthe
s
case
was
still
more
curious
she
was
an
equally
exact
portrait
of
adelaide
although
pierre
rougon
had
none
of
his
mother
s
features
distinctly
marked
the
physical
resemblance
had
as
it
were
passed
over
pierre
to
reappear
in
his
daughter
the
similarity
between
husband
and
wife
went
however
no
further
than
their
faces
if
the
worthy
son
of
a
steady
hatter
was
distinguishable
in
francois
marthe
showed
the
nervousness
and
mental
weakness
of
her
grandmother
perhaps
it
was
this
combination
of
physical
resemblance
and
moral
dissimilarity
which
threw
the
young
people
into
each
other
s
arms
from
to
they
had
three
children
francois
remained
in
his
uncle
s
employ
until
the
latter
retired
pierre
had
desired
to
sell
him
the
business
but
the
young
man
knew
what
small
chance
there
was
of
making
a
fortune
in
trade
at
plassans
so
he
declined
the
offer
and
repaired
to
marseilles
where
he
established
himself
with
his
little
savings
both
francois
and
marthe
figure
largely
in
conquest
of
macquart
soon
had
to
abandon
all
hope
of
dragging
this
big
industrious
fellow
into
his
campaign
against
the
rougons
whereupon
with
all
the
spite
of
a
lazybones
he
regarded
him
as
a
cunning
miser
he
fancied
however
that
he
had
discovered
the
accomplice
he
was
seeking
in
mouret
s
second
son
a
lad
of
fifteen
years
of
age
young
silvere
had
never
even
been
to
school
at
the
time
when
mouret
was
found
hanging
among
his
wife
s
skirts
his
elder
brother
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
him
took
him
also
to
his
uncle
s
the
latter
made
a
wry
face
on
beholding
the
child
he
had
no
intention
of
carrying
his
compensation
so
far
as
to
feed
a
useless
mouth
thus
silvere
to
whom
felicite
also
took
a
dislike
was
growing
up
in
tears
like
an
unfortunate
little
outcast
when
his
grandmother
adelaide
during
one
of
the
rare
visits
she
paid
the
rougons
took
pity
on
him
and
expressed
a
wish
to
have
him
with
her
pierre
was
delighted
he
let
the
child
go
without
even
suggesting
an
increase
of
the
paltry
allowance
that
he
made
adelaide
and
which
henceforward
would
have
to
suffice
for
two
adelaide
was
then
nearly
years
of
age
grown
old
while
leading
a
cloistered
existence
she
was
no
longer
the
lanky
ardent
girl
who
formerly
ran
to
embrace
the
smuggler
macquart
she
had
stiffened
and
hardened
in
her
hovel
in
the
impasse
that
dismal
silent
hole
where
she
lived
entirely
alone
on
potatoes
and
dry
vegetables
and
which
she
did
not
leave
once
in
the
course
of
a
month
on
seeing
her
pass
you
might
have
thought
her
to
be
one
of
those
delicately
white
old
nuns
with
automatic
gait
whom
the
cloister
has
kept
apart
from
all
the
concerns
of
this
world
her
pale
face
always
scrupulously
girt
with
a
white
cap
looked
like
that
of
a
dying
woman
a
vague
calm
countenance
it
was
wearing
an
air
of
supreme
indifference
prolonged
taciturnity
had
made
her
dumb
the
darkness
of
her
dwelling
and
the
continual
sight
of
the
same
objects
had
dulled
her
glance
and
given
her
eyes
the
limpidity
of
spring
water
absolute
renunciation
slow
physical
and
moral
death
had
little
by
little
converted
this
crazy
into
a
grave
matron
when
as
often
happened
a
blank
stare
came
into
her
eyes
and
she
gazed
before
her
without
seeing
anything
one
could
detect
utter
internal
void
through
those
deep
bright
cavities
nothing
now
remained
of
her
former
voluptuous
ardour
but
weariness
of
the
flesh
and
a
senile
tremor
of
the
hands
she
had
once
loved
like
a
but
was
now
wasted
already
sufficiently
worn
out
for
the
grave
there
had
been
strange
workings
of
her
nerves
during
her
long
years
of
chastity
a
dissolute
life
would
perhaps
have
wrecked
her
less
than
the
slow
hidden
ravages
of
unsatisfied
fever
which
had
modified
her
organism
sometimes
even
now
this
moribund
pale
old
woman
who
seemed
to
have
no
blood
left
in
her
was
seized
with
nervous
fits
like
electric
shocks
which
galvanised
her
and
for
an
hour
brought
her
atrocious
intensity
of
life
she
would
lie
on
her
bed
rigid
with
her
eyes
open
then
hiccoughs
would
come
upon
her
and
she
would
writhe
and
struggle
acquiring
the
frightful
strength
of
those
hysterical
madwomen
whom
one
has
to
tie
down
in
order
to
prevent
them
from
breaking
their
heads
against
a
wall
this
return
to
former
vigour
these
sudden
attacks
gave
her
a
terrible
shock
when
she
came
to
again
she
would
stagger
about
with
such
a
scared
stupefied
look
that
the
gossips
of
the
faubourg
used
to
say
she
s
been
drinking
the
crazy
old
thing
little
silvere
s
childish
smile
was
for
her
the
last
pale
ray
which
brought
some
warmth
to
her
frozen
limbs
weary
of
solitude
and
frightened
at
the
thought
of
dying
alone
in
one
of
her
fits
she
had
asked
to
have
the
child
with
the
little
fellow
running
about
near
her
she
felt
secure
against
death
without
relinquishing
her
habits
of
taciturnity
or
seeking
to
render
her
automatic
movements
more
supple
she
conceived
inexpressible
affection
for
him
stiff
and
speechless
she
would
watch
him
playing
for
hours
together
listening
with
delight
to
the
intolerable
noise
with
which
he
filled
the
old
hovel
that
tomb
had
resounded
with
uproar
ever
since
silvere
had
been
running
about
it
bestriding
broomsticks
knocking
up
against
the
doors
and
shouting
and
crying
he
brought
adelaide
back
to
the
world
as
it
were
she
looked
after
him
with
the
most
adorable
awkwardness
she
who
in
her
youth
had
neglected
the
duties
of
a
mother
now
felt
the
divine
pleasures
of
maternity
in
washing
his
face
dressing
him
and
watching
over
his
sickly
life
it
was
a
reawakening
of
love
a
last
soothing
passion
which
heaven
had
granted
to
this
woman
who
had
been
so
ravaged
by
the
want
of
some
one
to
love
the
touching
agony
of
a
heart
that
had
lived
amidst
the
most
acute
desires
and
which
was
now
dying
full
of
love
for
a
child
she
was
already
too
far
gone
to
pour
forth
the
babble
of
good
plump
grandmothers
she
adored
the
child
in
secret
with
the
bashfulness
of
a
young
girl
without
knowing
how
to
fondle
him
sometimes
she
took
him
on
her
knees
and
gazed
at
him
for
a
long
time
with
her
pale
eyes
when
the
little
one
frightened
by
her
mute
white
visage
began
to
cry
she
seemed
perplexed
by
what
she
had
done
and
quickly
put
him
down
upon
the
floor
without
even
kissing
him
perhaps
she
recognised
in
him
a
faint
resemblance
to
macquart
the
poacher
silvere
grew
up
ever
with
adelaide
with
childish
cajolery
he
used
to
call
her
aunt
dide
a
name
which
ultimately
clung
to
the
old
woman
the
word
aunt
employed
in
this
way
is
simply
a
term
of
endearment
in
provence
the
child
entertained
singular
affection
not
unmixed
with
respectful
terror
for
his
grandmother
during
her
nervous
fits
when
he
was
quite
a
little
boy
he
ran
away
from
her
crying
terrified
by
her
disfigured
countenance
and
he
came
back
very
timidly
after
the
attack
ready
to
run
away
again
as
though
the
old
woman
were
disposed
to
beat
him
later
on
however
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
he
would
stop
there
bravely
and
watch
in
order
that
she
might
not
hurt
herself
by
falling
off
the
bed
he
stood
for
hours
holding
her
tightly
in
his
arms
to
subdue
the
rude
shocks
which
distorted
her
during
intervals
of
calmness
he
would
gaze
with
pity
on
her
convulsed
features
and
withered
frame
over
which
her
skirts
lay
like
a
shroud
these
hidden
dramas
which
recurred
every
month
this
old
woman
as
rigid
as
a
corpse
this
child
bent
over
her
silently
watching
for
the
return
of
consciousness
made
up
amidst
the
darkness
of
the
hovel
a
strange
picture
of
mournful
horror
and
tenderness
when
aunt
dide
came
round
she
would
get
up
with
difficulty
and
set
about
her
work
in
the
hovel
without
even
questioning
silvere
she
remembered
nothing
and
the
child
from
a
sort
of
instinctive
prudence
avoided
the
least
allusion
to
what
had
taken
place
these
recurring
fits
more
than
anything
else
strengthened
silvere
s
deep
attachment
for
his
grandmother
in
the
same
manner
as
she
adored
him
without
any
garrulous
effusiveness
he
felt
a
secret
almost
bashful
affection
for
her
while
he
was
really
very
grateful
to
her
for
having
taken
him
in
and
brought
him
up
he
could
not
help
regarding
her
as
an
extraordinary
creature
a
prey
to
some
strange
malady
whom
he
ought
to
pity
and
respect
no
doubt
there
was
not
sufficient
life
left
in
adelaide
she
was
too
white
and
too
stiff
for
silvere
to
throw
himself
on
her
neck
thus
they
lived
together
amidst
melancholy
silence
in
the
depths
of
which
they
felt
the
tremor
of
boundless
love
the
sad
solemn
atmosphere
which
he
had
breathed
from
childhood
gave
silvere
a
strong
heart
in
which
gathered
every
form
of
enthusiasm
he
early
became
a
serious
thoughtful
little
man
seeking
instruction
with
a
kind
of
stubbornness
he
only
learnt
a
little
spelling
and
arithmetic
at
the
school
of
the
christian
brothers
which
he
was
compelled
to
leave
when
he
was
but
twelve
years
old
on
account
of
his
apprenticeship
he
never
acquired
the
first
rudiments
of
knowledge
however
he
read
all
the
odd
volumes
which
fell
into
his
hands
and
thus
provided
himself
with
strange
equipment
he
had
some
notions
of
a
multitude
of
subjects
notions
which
he
could
never
classify
distinctly
in
his
head
when
he
was
quite
young
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
playing
in
the
workshop
of
a
master
wheelwright
a
worthy
man
named
vian
who
lived
at
the
entrance
of
the
in
front
of
the
aire
where
he
stored
his
timber
silvere
used
to
jump
up
on
the
wheels
of
the
tilted
carts
undergoing
repair
and
amuse
himself
by
dragging
about
the
heavy
tools
which
his
tiny
hands
could
scarcely
lift
one
of
his
greatest
pleasures
too
was
to
assist
the
workmen
by
holding
some
piece
of
wood
for
them
or
bringing
them
the
which
they
required
when
he
had
grown
older
he
naturally
became
apprenticed
to
vian
the
latter
had
taken
a
liking
to
the
little
fellow
who
was
always
kicking
about
his
heels
and
asked
adelaide
to
let
him
come
refusing
to
take
anything
for
his
board
and
lodging
silvere
eagerly
accepted
already
foreseeing
the
time
when
he
would
be
able
to
make
his
poor
aunt
dide
some
return
for
all
she
had
spent
upon
him
in
a
short
time
he
became
an
excellent
workman
he
cherished
however
much
higher
ambitions
having
once
seen
at
a
coachbuilder
s
at
plassans
a
fine
new
carriage
shining
with
varnish
he
vowed
that
he
would
one
day
build
carriages
himself
he
remembered
this
carriage
as
a
rare
and
unique
work
of
art
an
ideal
towards
which
his
aspirations
should
tend
the
tilted
carts
at
which
he
worked
in
vian
s
shop
those
carts
which
he
had
lovingly
cherished
now
seemed
unworthy
of
his
affections
he
began
to
attend
the
local
where
he
formed
a
connection
with
a
youngster
who
had
left
college
and
who
lent
him
an
old
treatise
on
geometry
he
plunged
into
this
study
without
a
guide
racking
his
brains
for
weeks
together
in
order
to
grasp
the
simplest
problem
in
the
world
in
this
matter
he
gradually
became
one
of
those
learned
workmen
who
can
hardly
sign
their
name
and
yet
talk
about
algebra
as
though
it
were
an
intimate
friend
nothing
unsettles
the
mind
so
much
as
this
desultory
kind
of
education
which
reposes
on
no
firm
basis
most
frequently
such
scraps
of
knowledge
convey
an
absolutely
false
idea
of
the
highest
truths
and
render
persons
of
limited
intellect
insufferably
stupid
in
silvere
s
case
however
his
scraps
of
stolen
knowledge
only
augmented
his
liberal
aspirations
he
was
conscious
of
horizons
which
at
present
remained
closed
to
him
he
formed
for
himself
divine
conceptions
of
things
beyond
his
reach
and
lived
on
regarding
in
a
deep
innocent
religious
way
the
noble
thoughts
and
grand
conceptions
towards
which
he
was
raising
himself
but
which
he
could
not
as
yet
comprehend
he
was
one
of
the
one
whose
simplicity
was
divine
and
who
had
remained
on
the
threshold
of
the
temple
kneeling
before
the
tapers
which
from
a
distance
he
took
for
stars
the
hovel
in
the
impasse
consisted
in
the
first
place
of
a
large
room
into
which
the
street
door
opened
the
only
pieces
of
furniture
in
this
room
which
had
a
stone
floor
and
served
both
as
a
kitchen
and
a
were
some
chairs
a
table
on
trestles
and
an
old
coffer
which
adelaide
had
converted
into
a
sofa
by
spreading
a
piece
of
woollen
stuff
over
the
lid
in
the
left
hand
corner
of
the
large
fireplace
stood
a
plaster
image
of
the
holy
virgin
surrounded
by
artificial
flowers
she
is
the
traditional
good
mother
of
all
old
provencal
women
however
irreligious
they
may
be
a
passage
led
from
the
room
into
a
yard
situated
at
the
rear
of
the
house
in
this
yard
there
was
a
well
aunt
dide
s
bedroom
was
on
the
left
side
of
the
passage
it
was
a
little
apartment
containing
an
iron
bedstead
and
one
chair
silvere
slept
in
a
still
smaller
room
on
the
right
hand
side
just
large
enough
for
a
trestle
bedstead
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
plan
a
set
of
shelves
reaching
up
to
the
ceiling
to
keep
by
him
all
those
dear
odd
volumes
which
he
saved
his
sous
to
purchase
from
a
neighbouring
general
dealer
when
he
read
at
he
would
hang
his
lamp
on
a
nail
at
the
head
of
the
bed
if
his
grandmother
had
an
attack
he
merely
had
to
leap
out
at
the
first
gasp
to
be
at
her
side
in
a
moment
the
young
man
led
the
life
of
a
child
he
passed
his
existence
in
this
lonely
spot
like
his
father
he
felt
a
dislike
for
taverns
and
sunday
strolling
his
mates
wounded
his
delicate
susceptibilities
by
their
coarse
jokes
he
preferred
to
read
to
rack
his
rain
over
some
simple
geometrical
problem
since
aunt
dide
had
entrusted
him
with
the
little
household
commissions
she
did
not
go
out
at
all
but
ceased
all
intercourse
even
with
her
family
the
young
man
sometimes
thought
of
her
forlornness
he
reflected
that
the
poor
old
woman
lived
but
a
few
steps
from
the
children
who
strove
to
forget
her
as
though
she
were
dead
and
this
made
him
love
her
all
the
more
for
himself
and
for
the
others
when
he
at
times
entertained
a
vague
idea
that
aunt
dide
might
be
expiating
some
former
transgressions
he
would
say
to
himself
i
was
born
to
pardon
a
nature
such
as
silvere
s
ardent
yet
naturally
cherished
the
most
exalted
republican
ideas
at
night
in
his
little
hovel
silvere
would
again
and
again
read
a
work
of
rousseau
s
which
he
had
picked
up
at
the
neighbouring
dealer
s
among
a
number
of
old
locks
the
reading
of
this
book
kept
him
awake
till
daylight
amidst
his
dream
of
universal
happiness
so
dear
to
the
poor
the
words
liberty
equality
fraternity
rang
in
his
ears
like
those
sonorous
sacred
calls
of
the
bells
at
the
sound
of
which
the
faithful
fall
upon
their
knees
when
therefore
he
learnt
that
the
republic
had
just
been
proclaimed
in
france
he
fancied
that
the
whole
world
would
enjoy
a
life
of
celestial
beatitude
his
knowledge
though
imperfect
made
him
see
farther
than
other
workmen
his
aspirations
did
not
stop
at
daily
bread
but
his
extreme
ingenuousness
his
complete
ignorance
of
mankind
kept
him
in
the
dreamland
of
theory
a
garden
of
eden
where
universal
justice
reigned
his
paradise
was
for
a
long
time
a
delightful
spot
in
which
he
forgot
himself
when
he
came
to
perceive
that
things
did
not
go
on
quite
satisfactorily
in
the
best
of
republics
he
was
sorely
grieved
and
indulged
in
another
dream
that
of
compelling
men
to
be
happy
even
by
force
every
act
which
seemed
to
him
prejudicial
to
the
interest
of
the
people
roused
him
to
revengeful
indignation
though
he
was
as
gentle
as
a
child
he
cherished
the
fiercest
political
animosity
he
would
not
have
killed
a
fly
and
yet
he
was
for
ever
talking
of
a
call
to
arms
liberty
was
his
passion
an
unreasoning
absolute
passion
to
which
he
gave
all
the
feverish
ardour
of
his
blood
blinded
by
enthusiasm
he
was
both
too
ignorant
and
too
learned
to
be
tolerant
and
would
not
allow
for
men
s
weaknesses
he
required
an
ideal
government
of
perfect
justice
and
perfect
liberty
it
was
at
this
period
that
antoine
macquart
thought
of
setting
him
against
the
rougons
he
fancied
that
this
young
enthusiast
would
work
terrible
havoc
if
he
were
only
exasperated
to
the
proper
pitch
this
calculation
was
not
altogether
devoid
of
shrewdness
such
being
antoine
s
scheme
he
tried
to
induce
silvere
to
visit
him
by
professing
inordinate
admiration
for
the
young
man
s
ideas
but
he
very
nearly
compromised
the
whole
matter
at
the
outset
he
had
a
way
of
regarding
the
triumph
of
the
republic
as
a
question
of
personal
interest
as
an
era
of
happy
idleness
and
endless
junketing
which
chilled
his
nephew
s
purely
moral
aspirations
however
he
perceived
that
he
was
on
the
wrong
track
and
plunged
into
strange
bathos
a
string
of
empty
but
words
which
silvere
accepted
as
a
satisfactory
proof
of
his
civism
before
long
the
uncle
and
the
nephew
saw
each
other
two
or
three
times
a
week
during
their
long
discussions
in
which
the
fate
of
the
country
was
flatly
settled
antoine
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
young
man
that
the
rougons
was
the
chief
obstacle
to
the
welfare
of
france
but
he
again
made
a
false
move
by
calling
his
mother
old
jade
in
silvere
s
presence
he
even
repeated
to
him
the
early
scandals
about
the
poor
woman
the
young
man
blushed
for
shame
but
listened
without
interruption
he
had
not
asked
his
uncle
for
this
information
he
felt
by
such
confidences
which
wounded
his
feeling
of
respectful
affection
for
aunt
dide
from
that
time
forward
he
lavished
yet
more
attention
upon
his
grandmother
greeting
her
always
with
pleasant
smiles
and
looks
of
forgiveness
however
macquart
felt
that
he
had
acted
foolishly
and
strove
to
take
advantage
of
silvere
s
affection
for
adelaide
by
charging
the
rougons
with
her
forlornness
and
poverty
according
to
him
he
had
always
been
the
best
of
sons
whereas
his
brother
had
behaved
disgracefully
pierre
had
robbed
his
mother
and
now
when
she
was
penniless
he
was
ashamed
of
her
he
never
ceased
descanting
on
this
subject
silvere
thereupon
became
indignant
with
his
uncle
pierre
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
uncle
antoine
the
scene
was
much
the
same
every
time
the
young
man
called
he
used
to
come
in
the
evening
while
the
macquarts
were
at
dinner
the
father
would
be
swallowing
some
potato
stew
with
a
growl
picking
out
the
pieces
of
bacon
and
watching
the
dish
when
it
passed
into
the
hands
of
jean
and
gervaise
you
see
silvere
he
would
say
with
a
sullen
rage
which
was
beneath
his
air
of
cynical
indifference
more
potatoes
always
potatoes
we
never
eat
anything
else
now
meat
is
only
for
rich
people
it
s
getting
quite
impossible
to
make
both
ends
meet
with
children
who
have
the
devil
s
appetite
and
their
own
gervaise
and
jean
bent
over
their
plates
no
longer
even
daring
to
cut
some
bread
silvere
who
in
his
dream
lived
in
heaven
did
not
grasp
the
situation
in
a
calm
voice
he
pronounced
these
words
but
you
should
work
ah
yes
sneered
macquart
stung
to
the
quick
you
want
me
to
work
eh
to
let
those
beggars
the
rich
folk
continue
to
prey
upon
me
i
should
earn
probably
twenty
sous
a
day
and
ruin
my
constitution
it
s
worth
while
isn
t
it
everyone
earns
what
he
can
the
young
man
replied
twenty
sous
are
twenty
sous
and
it
all
helps
in
a
home
besides
you
re
an
old
soldier
why
don
t
you
seek
some
employment
fine
would
then
interpose
with
a
thoughtlessness
of
which
she
soon
repented
that
s
what
i
m
always
telling
him
said
she
the
market
inspector
wants
an
assistant
i
mentioned
my
husband
to
him
and
he
seems
well
disposed
towards
but
macquart
interrupted
her
with
a
fulminating
glance
eh
hold
your
tongue
he
growled
with
suppressed
anger
women
never
know
what
they
re
talking
about
nobody
would
have
me
my
opinions
are
too
every
time
he
was
offered
employment
he
displayed
similar
irritation
he
did
not
cease
however
to
ask
for
situations
though
he
always
refused
such
as
were
found
for
him
assigning
the
most
extraordinary
reasons
when
pressed
upon
the
point
he
became
terrible
if
jean
were
to
take
up
a
newspaper
after
dinner
he
would
at
once
exclaim
you
d
better
go
to
bed
you
ll
be
getting
up
late
and
that
ll
be
another
day
lost
to
think
of
that
young
rascal
coming
home
with
eight
francs
short
last
week
however
i
ve
requested
his
master
not
give
him
his
money
in
future
i
ll
call
for
it
jean
would
go
to
bed
to
avoid
his
father
s
recriminations
he
had
but
little
sympathy
with
silvere
politics
bored
him
and
he
thought
his
cousin
when
only
the
women
remained
if
they
unfortunately
started
some
whispered
converse
after
clearing
the
table
macquart
would
cry
now
you
idlers
is
there
nothing
that
requires
mending
we
re
all
in
rags
look
here
gervaise
i
was
at
your
mistress
s
and
i
learnt
some
fine
things
you
re
a
a
gervaise
now
a
grown
girl
of
more
than
twenty
coloured
up
at
thus
being
scolded
in
the
presence
of
silvere
who
himself
felt
uncomfortable
one
evening
having
come
rather
late
when
his
uncle
was
not
at
home
he
had
found
the
mother
and
daughter
intoxicated
before
an
empty
bottle
from
that
time
he
could
never
see
his
cousin
without
recalling
the
disgraceful
spectacle
she
had
presented
with
the
maudlin
grin
and
large
red
patches
on
her
poor
pale
puny
face
he
was
not
less
shocked
by
the
nasty
stories
that
circulated
with
regard
to
her
he
sometimes
looked
at
her
stealthily
with
the
timid
surprise
of
a
schoolboy
in
the
presence
of
a
disreputable
character
when
the
two
women
had
taken
up
their
needles
and
were
ruining
their
eyesight
in
order
to
mend
his
old
shirts
macquart
taking
the
best
seat
would
throw
himself
back
with
an
air
of
delicious
comfort
and
sip
and
smoke
like
a
man
who
relishes
his
laziness
this
was
the
time
when
the
old
rogue
generally
railed
against
the
wealthy
for
living
on
the
sweat
of
the
poor
man
s
brow
he
was
superbly
indignant
with
the
gentlemen
of
the
new
town
who
lived
so
idly
and
compelled
the
poor
to
keep
them
in
luxury
the
fragments
of
communistic
notions
which
he
culled
from
the
newspapers
in
the
morning
became
grotesque
and
monstrous
on
falling
from
his
lips
he
would
talk
of
a
time
near
at
hand
when
no
one
would
be
obliged
to
work
he
always
however
kept
his
fiercest
animosity
for
the
rougons
he
never
could
digest
the
potatoes
he
had
eaten
i
saw
that
vile
creature
felicite
buying
a
chicken
in
the
market
this
morning
he
would
say
those
robbers
of
inheritances
must
eat
chicken
forsooth
aunt
dide
interposed
silvere
says
that
uncle
pierre
was
very
kind
to
you
when
you
left
the
army
didn
t
he
spend
a
large
sum
of
money
in
lodging
and
clothing
you
a
large
sum
of
money
roared
macquart
in
exasperation
your
grandmother
is
mad
it
was
those
thieves
who
spread
those
reports
themselves
so
as
to
close
my
mouth
i
never
had
fine
again
foolishly
interfered
reminding
him
that
he
had
received
two
hundred
francs
besides
a
suit
of
clothes
and
a
year
s
rent
antoine
thereupon
shouted
to
her
to
hold
her
tongue
and
continued
with
increasing
fury
two
hundred
francs
a
fine
thing
i
want
my
due
ten
thousand
francs
ah
yes
talk
of
the
hole
they
shoved
me
into
like
a
dog
and
the
old
which
pierre
gave
me
because
he
was
ashamed
to
wear
it
any
longer
himself
it
was
so
dirty
and
ragged
he
was
not
speaking
the
truth
but
seeing
the
rage
that
he
was
in
nobody
ventured
to
protest
any
further
then
turning
towards
silvere
it
s
very
stupid
of
you
to
defend
them
he
added
they
robbed
your
mother
who
good
woman
would
be
alive
now
if
she
had
had
the
means
of
taking
care
of
oh
you
re
not
just
uncle
the
young
man
said
my
mother
did
not
die
for
want
of
attention
and
i
m
certain
my
father
would
never
have
accepted
a
sou
from
his
wife
s
family
pooh
don
t
talk
to
me
your
father
would
have
taken
the
money
just
like
anybody
else
we
were
disgracefully
plundered
and
it
s
high
time
we
had
our
then
macquart
for
the
hundredth
time
began
to
recount
the
story
of
the
fifty
thousand
francs
his
nephew
who
knew
it
by
heart
and
all
the
variations
with
which
he
embellished
it
listened
to
him
rather
impatiently
if
you
were
a
man
antoine
would
say
in
conclusion
you
would
come
some
day
with
me
and
we
would
kick
up
a
nice
row
at
the
rougons
we
would
not
leave
without
having
some
money
given
silvere
however
grew
serious
and
frankly
replied
if
those
wretches
robbed
us
so
much
the
worse
for
them
i
don
t
want
their
money
you
see
uncle
it
s
not
for
us
to
fall
on
our
relatives
if
they
ve
done
wrong
well
one
of
these
days
they
ll
be
severely
punished
for
ah
what
a
big
simpleton
you
are
the
uncle
cried
when
we
have
the
upper
hand
you
ll
see
whether
i
sha
n
t
settle
my
own
little
affairs
myself
god
cares
a
lot
about
us
indeed
what
a
foul
family
ours
is
even
if
i
were
starving
to
death
not
one
of
those
scoundrels
would
throw
me
a
dry
whenever
macquart
touched
upon
this
subject
he
proved
inexhaustible
he
bared
all
his
bleeding
wounds
of
envy
and
covetousness
he
grew
mad
with
rage
when
he
came
to
think
that
he
was
the
only
unlucky
one
in
the
family
and
was
forced
to
eat
potatoes
while
the
others
had
meat
to
their
heart
s
content
he
would
pass
all
his
relations
in
review
even
his
and
find
some
grievance
and
reason
for
threatening
every
one
of
them
yes
yes
he
repeated
bitterly
they
d
leave
me
to
die
like
a
gervaise
without
raising
her
head
or
ceasing
to
ply
her
needle
would
sometimes
say
timidly
still
father
cousin
pascal
was
very
kind
to
us
last
year
when
you
were
he
attended
you
without
charging
a
sou
continued
fine
coming
to
her
daughter
s
aid
and
he
often
slipped
a
piece
into
my
hand
to
make
you
some
he
he
d
have
killed
me
if
i
hadn
t
had
a
strong
constitution
macquart
retorted
hold
your
tongues
you
fools
you
d
let
yourselves
be
twisted
about
like
children
they
d
all
like
to
see
me
dead
when
i
m
ill
again
i
beg
you
not
to
go
and
fetch
my
nephew
for
i
didn
t
feel
at
all
comfortable
in
his
hands
he
s
only
a
doctor
and
hasn
t
got
a
decent
patient
in
all
his
when
once
macquart
was
fully
launched
he
could
not
stop
it
s
like
that
little
viper
aristide
he
would
say
a
false
brother
a
traitor
are
you
taken
in
by
his
articles
in
the
independant
silvere
you
would
be
a
fine
fool
if
you
were
they
re
not
even
written
in

french
i
ve
always
maintained
that
this
contraband
republican
is
in
league
with
his
worthy
father
to
humbug
us
you
ll
see
how
he
ll
turn
his
coat
and
his
brother
the
illustrious
eugene
that
big
blockhead
of
whom
the
rougons
make
such
a
fuss
why
they
ve
got
the
impudence
to
assert
that
he
occupies
a
good
position
in
paris
i
know
something
about
his
position
he
s
employed
at
the
rue
de

whose
upright
spirit
at

hurt
by
his
uncle

lying
accusations
ah
i

so
i
tell
you
he

one
of

days
with
your
benevolence
you
re
not

enough
i
don

want
to
say
anything
against
your
brother
francois
but
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
shouldn
t
like
the
scurvy
manner
in
which
he
treats
you
he
earns
a
heap
of
money
at
marseilles
and
yet
he
never
sends
you
a
paltry
pierce
for
pocket
money
if
ever
you
become
poor
i
shouldn

advise
you
to
look
to
him

and
slightly
injured
tone
of

only
say
what
s
true
that

all
i

ones
suffer
while
the
bad
ones
make
their
all
this
dirty
linen
which
macquart
washed
with
such
complacency
before
his

disgusted

would
have
liked
to
soar
back
into
his
dream
as
soon
as
he
began
to

unmistakable
signs
of
impatience

strong
expedients

exasperate
him

down
i
for

sheet
abruptly
interrupted
his
uncle
enough
he
cried
i
don
t
want
to
know
any
more
about
it
there
will
have
to
be
an
end
to
all
i
ll
hold
my
tongue
since
it
annoys
you
the
old
rascal
replied
feigning
a
manner
still
there
are
some
things
that
you
ought
not
to
be
ignorant
of
unless
you
want
to
play
the
part
of
a
macquart
while
exerting
himself
to
set
silvere
against
the
rougons
experienced
the
keenest
pleasure
on
drawing
tears
of
anguish
from
the
young
man
s
eyes
he
detested
him
perhaps
more
than
he
did
the
others
and
this
because
he
was
an
excellent
workman
and
never
drank
he
brought
all
his
instincts
of
refined
cruelty
into
play
in
order
to
invent
atrocious
falsehoods
which
should
sting
the
poor
lad
to
the
heart
then
he
revelled
in
his
pallor
his
trembling
hands
and
his
looks
with
the
delight
of
some
evil
spirit
who
measures
his
stabs
and
finds
that
he
has
struck
his
victim
in
the
right
place
when
he
thought
that
he
had
wounded
and
exasperated
silvere
sufficiently
he
would
at
last
touch
upon
politics
i
ve
been
assured
he
would
say
lowering
his
voice
that
the
rougons
are
preparing
some
treachery
silvere
asked
becoming
attentive
yes
one
of
these
nights
they
are
going
to
seize
all
the
good
citizens
of
the
town
and
throw
them
into
the
young
man
was
at
first
disposed
to
doubt
it
but
his
uncle
gave
precise
details
he
spoke
of
lists
that
had
been
drawn
up
he
mentioned
the
persons
whose
names
were
on
these
lists
he
indicated
in
what
manner
at
what
hour
and
under
what
circumstances
the
plot
would
be
carried
into
effect
silvere
gradually
allowed
himself
to
be
taken
in
by
this
old
woman
s
tale
and
was
soon
raving
against
the
enemies
of
the
republic
it
s
they
that
we
shall
have
to
reduce
to
impotence
if
they
persist
in
betraying
the
country
he
cried
and
what
do
they
intend
to
do
with
the
citizens
whom
they
arrest
what
do
they
intend
to
do
with
them
why
they
will
shoot
them
in
the
lowest
dungeons
of
the
prison
of
course
replied
macquart
with
a
hoarse
laugh
and
as
the
young
man
stupefied
with
horror
looked
at
him
without
knowing
what
to
say
this
will
not
be
the
first
lot
to
be
assassinated
there
he
continued
you
need
only
go
and
prowl
about
the
palais
de
justice
of
an
evening
to
hear
the
shots
and
oh
the
wretches
silvere
murmured
thereupon
uncle
and
nephew
launched
out
into
high
politics
fine
and
gervaise
on
finding
them
hotly
debating
things
quietly
went
to
bed
without
attracting
their
attention
then
the
two
men
remained
together
till
midnight
commenting
on
the
news
from
paris
and
discussing
the
approaching
and
inevitable
struggle
macquart
bitterly
denounced
the
men
of
his
own
party
silvere
dreamed
his
dream
of
ideal
liberty
aloud
and
for
himself
only
strange
conversations
these
were
during
which
the
uncle
poured
out
many
a
little
nip
for
himself
and
from
which
the
nephew
emerged
quite
intoxicated
with
enthusiasm
antoine
however
never
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
the
young
republican
any
perfidious
suggestion
or
play
of
warfare
against
the
rougons
in
vain
he
tried
to
goad
him
on
he
seldom
heard
him
suggest
aught
but
an
appeal
to
eternal
justice
which
sooner
or
later
would
punish
the
the
ingenuous
youth
did
indeed
speak
warmly
of
taking
up
arms
and
massacring
the
enemies
of
the
republic
but
as
soon
as
these
enemies
strayed
out
of
his
dream
or
became
personified
in
his
uncle
pierre
or
any
other
person
of
his
acquaintance
he
relied
upon
heaven
to
spare
him
the
horror
of
shedding
blood
it
is
very
probable
that
he
would
have
ceased
visiting
macquart
whose
jealous
fury
made
him
so
uncomfortable
if
he
had
not
tasted
the
pleasure
of
being
able
to
speak
freely
of
his
dear
republic
there
in
the
end
however
his
uncle
exercised
decisive
influence
over
his
destiny
he
irritated
his
nerves
by
his
everlasting
diatribes
and
succeeded
in
making
him
eager
for
an
armed
struggle
the
conquest
of
universal
happiness
by
violence
when
silvere
reached
his
sixteenth
year
macquart
had
him
admitted
into
the
secret
society
of
the
montagnards
a
powerful
association
whose
influence
extended
throughout
southern
france
from
that
moment
the
young
republican
gazed
with
longing
eyes
at
the
smuggler
s
carbine
which
adelaide
had
hung
over
her
once
night
while
his
grandmother
was
asleep
he
cleaned
and
put
it
in
proper
condition
then
he
replaced
it
on
its
nail
and
waited
indulging
in
brilliant
reveries
fancying
gigantic
epics
homeric
struggles
and
knightly
tournaments
whence
the
defenders
of
liberty
would
emerge
victorious
and
acclaimed
by
the
whole
world
macquart
meantime
was
not
discouraged
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
be
able
to
strangle
the
rougons
alone
if
he
could
ever
get
them
into
a
corner
his
envious
rage
and
slothful
greed
were
increased
by
certain
successive
accidents
which
compelled
him
to
resume
work
in
the
early
part
of
fine
died
almost
suddenly
from
inflammation
of
the
lungs
which
she
had
caught
by
going
one
evening
to
wash
the
family
linen
in
the
viorne
and
carrying
it
home
wet
on
her
back
she
returned
soaked
with
water
and
perspiration
bowed
down
by
her
load
which
was
terribly
heavy
and
she
never
recovered
her
death
filled
macquart
with
consternation
his
most
reliable
source
of
income
was
gone
when
a
few
days
later
he
sold
the
caldron
in
which
his
wife
had
boiled
her
chestnuts
and
the
wooden
horse
which
she
used
in
reseating
old
chairs
he
foully
accused
the
divinity
of
having
robbed
him
of
that
strong
strapping
woman
of
whom
he
had
often
felt
ashamed
but
whose
real
worth
he
now
appreciated
he
now
also
fell
upon
the
children
s
earnings
with
greater
avidity
than
ever
but
a
month
later
gervaise
tired
of
his
continual
exactions
ran
away
with
her
two
children
and
lantier
whose
mother
was
dead
the
lovers
took
refuge
in
paris
antoine
overwhelmed
vented
his
rage
against
his
daughter
by
expressing
the
hope
that
she
might
die
in
hospital
like
most
of
her
kind
this
abuse
did
not
however
improve
the
situation
which
was
decidedly
becoming
bad
jean
soon
followed
his
sister
s
example
he
waited
for
to
come
round
and
then
contrived
to
receive
the
money
himself
as
he
was
leaving
he
told
one
of
his
friends
who
repeated
it
to
antoine
that
he
would
no
longer
keep
his
lazy
father
and
that
if
the
latter
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
have
him
brought
back
by
the
gendarmes
he
would
touch
neither
saw
nor
plane
on
the
morrow
when
antoine
having
vainly
sought
him
found
himself
alone
and
penniless
in
the
house
where
for
twenty
years
he
had
been
comfortably
kept
he
flew
into
the
most
frantic
rage
kicked
the
furniture
about
and
yelled
the
vilest
imprecations
then
he
sank
down
exhausted
and
began
to
drag
himself
about
and
moan
like
a
convalescent
the
fear
of
having
to
earn
his
bread
made
him
positively
ill
when
silvere
came
to
see
him
he
complained
with
tears
of
his
children
s
ingratitude
had
he
not
always
been
a
good
father
to
them
jean
and
gervaise
were
monsters
who
had
made
him
an
evil
return
for
all
he
had
done
for
them
now
they
abandoned
him
because
he
was
old
and
they
could
not
get
anything
more
out
of
him
but
uncle
said
silvere
you
are
not
yet
too
old
to
work
macquart
coughing
and
stooping
shook
his
head
mournfully
as
if
to
say
that
he
could
not
bear
the
least
fatigue
for
any
length
of
time
just
as
his
nephew
was
about
to
withdraw
he
borrowed
ten
francs
of
him
then
for
a
month
he
lived
by
taking
his
children
s
old
clothes
one
by
one
to
a
dealer
s
and
in
the
same
way
little
by
little
he
sold
all
the
small
articles
in
the
house
soon
nothing
remained
but
a
table
a
chair
his
bed
and
the
clothes
on
his
back
he
ended
by
exchanging
the
bedstead
for
a
plain
strap
one
when
he
had
exhausted
all
his
resources
he
cried
with
rage
and
with
the
fierce
pallor
of
a
man
who
is
resigned
to
suicide
he
went
to
look
for
the
bundle
of
osier
that
he
had
forgotten
in
some
corner
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
past
as
he
took
it
up
he
seemed
to
be
lifting
a
mountain
however
he
again
began
to
plait
baskets
and
hampers
while
denouncing
the
human
race
for
their
neglect
it
was
particularly
at
this
time
that
he
talked
of
dividing
and
sharing
the
riches
of
the
wealthy
he
showed
himself
terrible
his
speeches
kept
up
a
constant
conflagration
in
the
tavern
where
his
furious
looks
secured
him
unlimited
credit
moreover
he
only
worked
when
he
had
been
unable
to
get
a
piece
out
of
silvere
or
a
comrade
he
was
no
longer
monsieur
macquart
the
workman
who
wore
his
sunday
clothes
every
day
and
played
the
gentleman
he
again
became
the
big
slovenly
devil
who
had
once
speculated
on
his
rags
felicite
did
not
dare
to
go
to
market
now
that
he
was
so
often
coming
there
to
sell
his
baskets
he
once
had
a
violent
quarrel
with
her
there
his
hatred
against
the
rougons
grew
with
his
wretchedness
he
swore
with
horrible
threats
that
he
would
wreak
justice
himself
since
the
rich
were
leagued
together
to
compel
him
to
toil
in
this
state
of
mind
he
welcomed
the
coup
d
etat
with
the
ardent
obstreperous
delight
of
a
hound
scenting
the
quarry
as
the
few
honest
liberals
in
the
town
had
failed
to
arrive
at
an
understanding
amongst
themselves
and
therefore
kept
apart
he
became
naturally
one
of
the
most
prominent
agents
of
the
insurrection
the
working
classes
notwithstanding
the
unfavourable
opinion
which
they
at
last
entertained
of
this
lazy
fellow
would
when
the
time
arrived
have
to
accept
him
as
a
rallying
flag
on
the
first
few
days
however
the
town
remained
quiet
and
macquart
thought
that
his
plans
were
frustrated
it
was
not
until
the
news
arrived
of
the
rising
of
the
rural
districts
that
he
recovered
hope
for
his
own
part
he
would
not
have
left
plassans
for
all
the
world
accordingly
he
invented
some
pretext
for
not
following
those
workmen
who
on
the
sunday
morning
set
off
to
join
the
insurrectionary
band
of
la
palud
and
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
he
was
sitting
in
some
disreputable
tavern
of
the
old
quarter
with
a
few
friends
when
a
comrade
came
to
inform
him
that
the
insurgents
were
only
a
few
miles
from
plassans
this
news
had
just
been
brought
by
an
express
who
had
succeeded
in
making
his
way
into
the
town
and
had
been
charged
to
get
the
gates
opened
for
the
column
there
was
an
outburst
of
triumph
macquart
especially
appeared
to
be
delirious
with
enthusiasm
the
unforeseen
arrival
of
the
insurgents
seemed
to
him
a
delicate
attention
of
providence
for
his
own
particular
benefit
his
hands
trembled
at
the
idea
that
he
would
soon
hold
the
rougons
by
the
throat
he
hastily
quitted
the
tavern
with
his
friends
all
the
republicans
who
had
not
yet
left
the
town
were
soon
assembled
on
the
cours
sauvaire
it
was
this
band
that
rougon
had
perceived
as
he
was
hastening
to
conceal
himself
in
his
mother
s
house
when
the
band
had
reached
the
top
of
the
rue
de
la
banne
macquart
who
had
stationed
himself
at
the
rear
detained
four
of
his
companions
big
fellows
who
were
not
with
brains
and
whom
he
swayed
by
his
tavern
bluster
he
easily
persuaded
them
that
the
enemies
of
the
republic
must
be
arrested
immediately
if
they
wished
to
prevent
the
greatest
calamities
the
truth
was
that
he
feared
pierre
might
escape
him
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
which
the
entry
of
the
insurgents
would
produce
however
the
four
big
fellows
followed
him
with
exemplary
docility
and
knocked
violently
at
the
door
of
the
rougons
abode
in
this
critical
situation
felicite
displayed
admirable
courage
she
went
down
and
opened
the
street
door
herself
we
want
to
go
upstairs
into
your
rooms
macquart
said
to
her
brutally
very
well
gentlemen
walk
up
she
replied
with
ironical
politeness
pretending
that
she
did
not
recognise
her
once
upstairs
macquart
ordered
her
to
fetch
her
husband
my
husband
is
not
here
she
said
with
perfect
calmness
he
is
travelling
on
business
he
took
the
diligence
for
marseilles
at
six
o
clock
this
antoine
at
this
declaration
which
felicite
uttered
in
a
clear
voice
made
a
gesture
of
rage
he
rushed
through
the
and
then
into
the
bedroom
turned
the
bed
up
looked
behind
the
curtains
and
under
the
furniture
the
four
big
fellows
assisted
him
they
searched
the
place
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
felicite
meantime
quietly
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
and
began
to
fasten
the
strings
of
her
petticoats
like
a
person
who
has
been
surprised
in
her
sleep
and
has
not
had
time
to
dress
properly
it
s
true
then
he
s
run
away
the
coward
macquart
muttered
on
returning
to
the
nevertheless
he
continued
to
look
about
him
with
a
suspicious
air
he
felt
a
presentiment
that
pierre
could
not
have
given
up
the
game
at
the
decisive
moment
at
last
he
approached
felicite
who
was
yawning
show
us
the
place
where
your
husband
is
hidden
he
said
to
her
and
i
promise
no
harm
shall
be
done
to
i
have
told
you
the
truth
she
replied
impatiently
i
can
t
deliver
my
husband
to
you
as
he
s
not
here
you
have
searched
everywhere
haven
t
you
then
leave
me
alone
macquart
exasperated
by
her
composure
was
just
going
to
strike
her
when
a
rumbling
noise
arose
from
the
street
it
was
the
column
of
insurgents
entering
the
rue
de
la
banne
he
then
had
to
leave
the
yellow
after
shaking
his
fist
at
his
calling
her
an
old
jade
and
threatening
that
he
would
soon
return
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
he
took
one
of
the
men
who
accompanied
him
a
navvy
named
cassoute
the
most
of
the
four
and
ordered
him
to
sit
on
the
first
step
and
remain
there
you
must
come
and
inform
me
he
said
to
him
if
you
see
the
scoundrel
from
upstairs
the
man
sat
down
heavily
when
macquart
reached
the
pavement
he
raised
his
eyes
and
observed
felicite
leaning
out
of
the
window
of
the
room
watching
the
march
past
of
the
insurgents
as
if
it
was
nothing
but
a
regiment
passing
through
the
town
to
the
strains
of
its
band
this
last
sign
of
perfect
composure
irritated
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
was
almost
tempted
to
go
up
again
and
throw
the
old
woman
into
the
street
however
he
followed
the
column
muttering
in
a
hoarse
voice
yes
yes
look
at
us
passing
we
ll
see
whether
you
will
station
yourself
at
your
balcony
it
was
nearly
eleven
o
clock
at
night
when
the
insurgents
entered
the
town
by
the
porte
de
rome
the
workmen
remaining
in
plassans
had
opened
the
gate
for
them
in
spite
of
the
wailings
of
the
keeper
from
whom
they
could
only
wrest
the
keys
by
force
this
man
very
jealous
of
his
office
stood
dumbfoundered
in
the
presence
of
the
surging
crowd
to
think
of
it
he
who
never
allowed
more
than
one
person
to
pass
in
at
a
time
and
then
only
after
a
prolonged
examination
of
his
face
and
he
murmured
that
he
was
dishonoured
the
men
of
plassans
were
still
marching
at
the
head
of
the
column
by
way
of
guiding
the
others
miette
who
was
in
the
front
rank
with
silvere
on
her
left
held
up
her
banner
more
proudly
than
ever
now
that
she
could
divine
behind
the
closed
blinds
the
scared
looks
of
bourgeois
startled
out
of
their
sleep
the
insurgents
passed
along
the
rue
de
rome
and
the
rue
de
la
banne
slowly
and
warily
at
every
crossway
although
they
well
knew
the
quiet
disposition
of
the
inhabitants
they
feared
they
might
be
received
with
bullets
the
town
seemed
lifeless
however
there
was
scarcely
a
stifled
exclamation
to
be
heard
at
the
windows
only
five
or
six
shutters
opened
some
old
householder
then
appeared
in
his
candle
in
hand
and
leant
out
to
obtain
a
better
view
but
as
soon
as
he
distinguished
the
tall
red
girl
who
appeared
to
be
drawing
that
crowd
of
black
demons
behind
her
he
hastily
closed
his
window
again
terrified
by
such
a
diabolical
apparition
the
silence
of
the
slumbering
town
reassured
the
insurgents
who
ventured
to
make
their
way
through
the
lanes
of
the
old
quarter
and
thus
reached
the
and
the
place
de
l
which
was
connected
by
a
short
but
broad
street
these
open
spaces
planted
with
slender
trees
were
brilliantly
illumined
by
the
moon
against
the
clear
sky
the
recently
restored
appeared
like
a
large
patch
of
crude
whiteness
the
fine
black
lines
of
the
arabesques
of
the
balcony
showing
in
bold
relief
several
persons
could
be
plainly
distinguished
standing
on
this
balcony
the
mayor
commander
sicardot
three
or
four
municipal
councillors
and
other
functionaries
the
doors
below
were
closed
the
three
thousand
republicans
who
covered
both
open
spaces
halted
with
upraised
heads
ready
to
force
the
doors
with
a
single
push
the
arrival
of
the
insurrectionary
column
at
such
an
hour
took
the
authorities
by
surprise
before
repairing
to
the
mayor
s
commander
sicardot
had
taken
time
to
don
his
uniform
he
then
had
to
run
and
rouse
the
mayor
when
the
keeper
of
the
porte
de
rome
who
had
been
left
free
by
the
insurgents
came
to
announce
that
the
villains
were
already
in
the
town
the
commander
had
so
far
only
managed
to
assemble
a
score
of
the
national
guards
the
gendarmes
though
their
barracks
were
close
by
could
not
even
be
warned
it
was
necessary
to
shut
the
doors
in
all
haste
in
order
to
deliberate
five
minutes
later
a
low
continuous
rumbling
announced
the
approach
of
the
column
monsieur
garconnet
out
of
hatred
to
the
republic
would
have
greatly
liked
to
offer
resistance
but
he
was
of
a
prudent
nature
and
comprehended
the
futility
of
a
struggle
on
finding
only
a
few
pale
men
who
were
scarcely
awake
around
him
so
the
deliberations
did
not
last
long
sicardot
alone
was
obstinate
he
wanted
to
fight
asserting
that
twenty
men
would
suffice
to
bring
these
three
thousand
villains
to
reason
at
this
monsieur
garconnet
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
declared
that
the
only
step
to
take
was
to
make
an
honourable
capitulation
as
the
uproar
of
the
mob
increased
he
went
out
on
the
balcony
followed
by
all
the
persons
present
silence
was
gradually
obtained
below
among
the
black
quivering
mass
of
insurgents
the
guns
and
scythes
glittered
in
the
moonlight
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
cried
the
mayor
in
a
loud
voice
thereupon
a
man
in
a
greatcoat
a
landowner
of
la
palud
stepped
forward
open
the
doors
he
said
without
replying
to
monsieur
garconnet
s
question
avoid
a
fratricidal
i
call
upon
you
to
withdraw
the
mayor
continued
i
protest
in
the
name
of
the
these
words
provoked
deafening
shouts
from
the
crowd
when
the
tumult
had
somewhat
abated
vehement
calls
ascended
to
the
balcony
voices
shouted
it
is
in
the
name
of
the
law
that
we
have
come
here
your
duty
as
a
functionary
is
to
secure
respect
for
the
fundamental
law
of
the
land
the
constitution
which
has
just
been
outrageously
long
live
the
constitution
long
live
the
republic
then
as
monsieur
garconnet
endeavoured
to
make
himself
heard
and
continued
to
invoke
his
official
dignity
the
of
la
palud
who
was
standing
under
the
balcony
interrupted
him
with
great
vehemence
you
are
now
nothing
but
the
functionary
of
a
fallen
functionary
we
have
come
to
dismiss
you
from
your
hitherto
commander
sicardot
had
been
ragefully
biting
his
moustache
and
muttering
insulting
words
the
sight
of
the
cudgels
and
scythes
exasperated
him
and
he
made
desperate
efforts
to
restrain
himself
from
treating
these
soldiers
who
had
not
even
a
gun
apiece
as
they
deserved
but
when
he
heard
a
gentleman
in
a
mere
greatcoat
speak
of
deposing
a
mayor
girded
with
his
scarf
he
could
no
longer
contain
himself
and
shouted
you
pack
of
rascals
if
i
only
had
four
men
and
a
corporal
i
d
come
down
and
pull
your
ears
for
you
and
make
you
behave
yourselves
less
than
this
was
needed
to
raise
a
serious
disturbance
a
long
shout
rose
from
the
mob
as
it
made
a
rush
for
the
doors
monsieur
garconnet
in
consternation
hastily
quitted
the
balcony
entreating
sicardot
to
be
reasonable
unless
he
wished
to
have
them
massacred
but
in
two
minutes
the
doors
gave
way
the
people
invaded
the
building
and
disarmed
the
national
guards
the
mayor
and
the
other
functionaries
present
were
arrested
sicardot
who
declined
to
surrender
his
sword
had
to
be
protected
from
the
fury
of
some
insurgents
by
the
chief
of
the
contingent
from
les
tulettes
a
man
of
great
when
the
was
in
the
hands
of
the
republicans
they
led
their
prisoners
to
a
small
cafe
in
the
and
there
kept
them
closely
watched
the
insurrectionary
army
would
have
avoided
marching
through
plassans
if
its
leaders
had
not
decided
that
a
little
food
and
a
few
hours
rest
were
absolutely
necessary
for
the
men
instead
of
pushing
forward
direct
to
the
chief
town
of
the
department
the
column
owing
to
the
inexcusable
weakness
and
the
inexperience
of
the
improvised
general
who
commanded
it
was
now
diverging
to
the
left
making
a
detour
which
was
destined
ultimately
to
lead
it
to
destruction
it
was
bound
for
the
heights
of
still
about
ten
leagues
distant
and
it
was
in
view
of
this
long
march
that
it
had
been
decided
to
pass
through
plassans
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour
it
was
now
eleven
when
monsieur
garconnet
learnt
that
the
band
was
in
quest
of
provisions
he
offered
his
services
to
procure
them
this
functionary
formed
under
very
difficult
circumstances
a
proper
estimate
of
the
situation
those
three
thousand
starving
men
would
have
to
be
satisfied
it
would
never
do
for
plassans
on
waking
up
to
find
them
still
squatting
on
the
pavements
if
they
withdrew
before
daybreak
they
would
simply
have
passed
through
the
slumbering
town
like
an
evil
dream
like
one
of
those
nightmares
which
depart
with
the
arrival
of
dawn
and
so
although
he
remained
a
prisoner
monsieur
garconnet
followed
by
two
guards
went
about
knocking
at
the
bakers
doors
and
had
all
the
provisions
that
he
could
find
distributed
among
the
insurgents
towards
one
o
clock
the
three
thousand
men
began
to
eat
squatting
on
the
ground
with
their
weapons
between
their
legs
the
and
the
neighbourhood
of
the
were
turned
into
vast
refectories
in
spite
of
the
bitter
cold
humorous
sallies
were
exchanged
among
the
swarming
multitude
the
smallest
groups
of
which
showed
forth
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
the
poor
famished
fellows
eagerly
devoured
their
portions
while
breathing
on
their
fingers
to
warm
them
and
from
the
depths
of
adjoining
streets
where
vague
black
forms
sat
on
the
white
thresholds
of
the
houses
there
came
sudden
bursts
of
laughter
at
the
windows
emboldened
inquisitive
women
with
silk
handkerchiefs
tied
round
their
heads
watched
the
repast
of
those
terrible
insurgents
those
who
went
in
turn
to
the
market
pump
to
drink
a
little
water
in
the
hollows
of
their
hands
while
the
was
being
invaded
the
gendarmes
barracks
situated
a
few
steps
away
in
the
rue
canquoin
which
leads
to
the
market
had
also
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
mob
the
gendarmes
were
surprised
in
their
beds
and
disarmed
in
a
few
minutes
the
impetus
of
the
crowd
had
carried
miette
and
silvere
along
in
this
direction
the
girl
who
still
clasped
her
flagstaff
to
her
breast
was
pushed
against
the
wall
of
the
barracks
while
the
young
man
carried
away
by
the
human
wave
penetrated
into
the
interior
and
helped
his
comrades
to
wrest
from
the
gendarmes
the
carbines
which
they
had
hastily
caught
up
silvere
waxing
ferocious
intoxicated
by
the
onslaught
attacked
a
big
devil
of
a
gendarme
named
rengade
with
whom
for
a
few
moments
he
struggled
at
last
by
a
sudden
jerk
he
succeeded
in
wresting
his
carbine
from
him
but
the
barrel
struck
rengade
a
violent
blow
in
the
face
which
put
his
right
eye
out
blood
flowed
and
some
of
it
splashing
silvere
s
hands
quickly
brought
him
to
his
senses
he
looked
at
his
hands
dropped
the
carbine
and
ran
out
in
a
state
of
frenzy
shaking
his
fingers
you
are
wounded
cried
miette
no
no
he
replied
in
a
stifled
voice
i
ve
just
killed
a
is
he
really
dead
asked
miette
i
don
t
know
replied
silvere
his
face
was
all
covered
with
blood
come
then
he
hurried
the
girl
away
on
reaching
the
market
he
made
her
sit
down
on
a
stone
bench
and
told
her
to
wait
there
for
him
he
was
still
looking
at
his
hands
muttering
something
at
the
same
time
miette
at
last
understood
from
his
disquieted
words
that
he
wished
to
go
and
kiss
his
grandmother
before
leaving
well
go
she
said
don
t
trouble
yourself
about
me
wash
your
but
he
went
quickly
away
keeping
his
fingers
apart
without
thinking
of
washing
them
at
the
pump
which
he
passed
since
he
had
felt
rengade
s
warm
blood
on
his
skin
he
had
been
possessed
by
one
idea
that
of
running
to
aunt
dide
s
and
dipping
his
hands
in
the
at
the
back
of
the
little
yard
there
only
he
thought
would
he
be
able
to
wash
off
the
stain
of
that
blood
moreover
all
his
calm
gentle
childhood
seemed
to
return
to
him
he
felt
an
irresistible
longing
to
take
refuge
in
his
grandmother
s
skirts
if
only
for
a
minute
he
arrived
quite
out
of
breath
aunt
dide
had
not
gone
to
bed
a
circumstance
which
at
any
other
time
would
have
greatly
surprised
silvere
but
on
entering
he
did
not
even
see
his
uncle
rougon
who
was
seated
in
a
corner
on
the
old
chest
he
did
not
wait
for
the
poor
old
woman
s
questions
grandmother
he
said
quickly
you
must
forgive
me
i
m
going
to
leave
with
the
others
you
see
i
ve
got
blood
on
me
i
believe
i
ve
killed
a
you
ve
killed
a
gendarme
aunt
dide
repeated
in
a
strange
voice
her
eyes
gleamed
brightly
as
she
fixed
them
on
the
red
stains
and
suddenly
she
turned
towards
the
you
ve
taken
the
gun
she
said
where
s
the
gun
silvere
who
had
left
the
weapon
with
miette
swore
to
her
that
it
was
quite
safe
and
for
the
very
first
time
adelaide
made
an
allusion
to
the
smuggler
macquart
in
her
grandson
s
presence
you
ll
bring
the
gun
back
you
promise
me
she
said
with
singular
energy
it
s
all
i
have
left
of
him
you
ve
killed
a
gendarme
ah
it
was
the
gendarmes
who
killed
him
she
continued
gazing
fixedly
at
silvere
with
an
air
of
cruel
satisfaction
and
apparently
without
thought
of
detaining
him
she
never
asked
him
for
any
explanation
nor
wept
like
those
good
grandmothers
who
always
imagine
at
sight
of
the
least
scratch
that
their
grandchildren
are
dying
all
her
nature
was
concentrated
in
one
unique
thought
to
which
she
at
last
gave
expression
with
ardent
curiosity
did
you
kill
the
gendarme
with
the
gun
either
silvere
did
not
quite
catch
what
she
said
or
else
he
misunderstood
her
yes
he
replied
i
m
going
to
wash
my
it
was
only
on
returning
from
the
well
that
he
perceived
his
uncle
pierre
had
turned
pale
on
hearing
the
young
man
s
words
felicite
was
indeed
right
his
family
took
a
pleasure
in
compromising
him
one
of
his
nephews
had
now
killed
a
gendarme
he
would
never
get
the
post
of
receiver
of
taxes
if
he
did
not
prevent
this
foolish
madman
from
rejoining
the
insurgents
so
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
door
determined
to
prevent
silvere
from
going
out
listen
he
said
to
the
young
fellow
who
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
him
there
i
am
the
head
of
the
family
and
i
forbid
you
to
leave
this
house
you
re
risking
both
your
honour
and
ours
i
will
try
to
get
you
across
the
but
silvere
shrugged
his
shoulders
let
me
pass
he
calmly
replied
i
m
not
a
i
shall
not
reveal
your
never
and
as
rougon
continued
to
speak
of
the
family
dignity
and
the
authority
with
which
his
seniority
invested
him
do
i
belong
to
your
family
the
young
man
continued
you
have
always
disowned
me
fear
has
driven
you
here
because
you
feel
that
the
day
of
judgment
has
arrived
come
make
way
i
don
t
hide
myself
i
have
a
duty
to
rougon
did
not
stir
but
aunt
dide
who
had
listened
with
a
sort
of
delight
to
silvere
s
vehement
language
laid
her
withered
hand
on
her
son
s
arm
get
out
of
the
way
pierre
she
said
the
lad
must
the
young
man
gave
his
uncle
a
slight
shove
and
dashed
outside
then
rougon
having
carefully
shut
the
door
again
said
to
his
mother
in
an
angry
threatening
tone
if
any
mischief
happens
to
him
it
will
be
your
fault
you
re
an
old
you
don
t
know
what
you
ve
just
adelaide
however
did
not
appear
to
hear
him
she
went
and
threw
some
on
the
fire
which
was
going
out
and
murmured
with
a
vague
smile
i
m
used
to
it
he
would
remain
away
for
months
together
and
then
come
back
to
me
in
much
better
she
was
no
doubt
speaking
of
macquart
in
the
meantime
silvere
hastily
regained
the
as
he
approached
the
spot
where
he
had
left
miette
he
heard
a
loud
uproar
of
voices
and
saw
a
crowd
which
made
him
quicken
his
steps
a
cruel
scene
had
just
occurred
some
inquisitive
people
were
walking
among
the
insurgents
while
the
latter
quietly
partook
of
their
meal
amongst
these
onlookers
was
justin
rebufat
the
son
of
the
farmer
of
the
a
youth
of
twenty
years
old
a
sickly
creature
who
harboured
implacable
hatred
against
his
cousin
miette
at
home
he
grudged
her
the
bread
she
ate
and
treated
her
like
a
beggar
picked
up
from
the
gutter
out
of
charity
it
is
probable
that
the
young
girl
had
rejected
his
advances
lank
and
pale
with
limbs
and
face
all
awry
he
revenged
himself
upon
her
for
his
own
ugliness
and
the
contempt
which
the
handsome
vigorous
girl
must
have
evinced
for
him
he
ardently
longed
to
induce
his
father
to
send
her
about
her
business
and
for
this
reason
he
was
always
spying
upon
her
for
some
time
past
he
had
become
aware
of
the
meetings
with
silvere
and
had
only
awaited
a
decisive
opportunity
to
reveal
everything
to
his
father
rebufat
on
the
evening
in
question
having
seen
her
leave
home
at
about
eight
o
clock
justin
s
hatred
had
overpowered
him
and
he
had
been
unable
to
keep
silent
any
longer
rebufat
on
hearing
his
story
fell
into
a
terrible
rage
and
declared
that
he
would
kick
the
gadabout
out
of
his
house
should
she
have
the
audacity
to
return
justin
then
went
to
bed
relishing
beforehand
the
fine
scene
which
would
take
place
on
the
morrow
then
however
a
burning
desire
came
upon
him
for
some
immediate
foretaste
of
his
revenge
so
he
dressed
himself
again
and
went
out
perhaps
he
might
meet
miette
in
that
case
he
was
resolved
to
treat
her
insolently
this
is
how
he
came
to
witness
the
arrival
of
the
insurgents
whom
he
followed
to
the
with
a
vague
presentiment
that
he
would
find
the
lovers
there
and
indeed
he
at
last
caught
sight
of
his
cousin
on
the
seat
where
she
was
waiting
for
silvere
seeing
her
wrapped
in
her
long
pelisse
with
the
red
flag
at
her
side
resting
against
a
market
pillar
he
began
to
sneer
and
deride
her
in
foul
language
the
girl
thunderstruck
at
seeing
him
was
unable
to
speak
she
wept
beneath
his
abuse
and
whist
she
was
overcome
by
sobbing
bowing
her
head
and
hiding
her
face
justin
called
her
a
convict
s
daughter
and
shouted
that
old
rebufat
would
give
her
a
good
thrashing
should
she
ever
dare
to
return
to
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
thus
kept
her
smarting
and
trembling
some
people
had
gathered
round
and
grinned
stupidly
at
the
painful
scene
at
last
a
few
insurgents
interfered
and
threatened
the
young
man
with
exemplary
chastisement
if
he
did
not
leave
miette
alone
but
justin
although
he
retreated
declared
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
them
it
was
just
at
this
moment
that
silvere
came
up
young
rebufat
on
catching
sight
of
him
made
a
sudden
bound
as
if
to
take
flight
for
he
was
afraid
of
him
knowing
that
he
was
much
stronger
than
himself
he
could
not
however
resist
the
temptation
to
cast
a
parting
insult
on
the
girl
in
her
lover
s
presence
ah
i
knew
very
well
he
cried
that
the
wheelwright
could
not
be
far
off
you
left
us
to
run
after
that
fellow
eh
you
wretched
girl
when
s
the
baptism
to
be
then
he
retreated
a
few
steps
further
on
seeing
silvere
clench
his
fists
and
mind
he
continued
with
a
vile
sneer
don
t
come
to
our
house
again
my
father
will
kick
you
out
if
you
do
do
you
hear
but
he
ran
away
howling
with
bruised
visage
for
silvere
had
bounded
upon
him
and
dealt
him
a
blow
full
in
the
face
the
young
man
did
not
pursue
him
when
he
returned
to
miette
he
found
her
standing
up
feverishly
wiping
her
tears
away
with
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
as
he
gazed
at
her
tenderly
in
order
to
console
her
she
made
a
sudden
energetic
gesture
no
she
said
i
m
not
going
to
cry
any
more
you
ll
see
i
m
very
glad
of
it
i
don
t
feel
any
regret
now
for
having
left
home
i
am
she
took
up
the
flag
and
led
silvere
back
into
the
midst
of
the
insurgents
it
was
now
nearly
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
cold
was
becoming
so
intense
that
the
republicans
had
risen
to
their
feet
and
were
marching
to
and
fro
in
order
to
warm
themselves
while
they
finished
their
bread
at
last
their
leaders
gave
orders
for
departure
the
column
formed
again
the
prisoners
were
placed
in
the
middle
of
it
besides
monsieur
garconnet
and
commander
sicardot
the
insurgents
had
arrested
monsieur
peirotte
the
receiver
of
taxes
and
several
other
functionaries
all
of
whom
they
led
away
at
this
moment
aristide
was
observed
walking
about
among
the
groups
in
presence
of
this
formidable
rising
the
dear
fellow
had
thought
it
imprudent
not
to
remain
on
friendly
terms
with
the
republicans
but
as
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
desire
to
compromise
himself
too
much
he
had
come
to
bid
them
farewell
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
complaining
bitterly
of
the
accursed
injury
which
prevented
him
from
carrying
a
weapon
as
he
walked
through
the
crowd
he
came
across
his
brother
pascal
provided
with
a
case
of
surgical
instruments
and
a
little
portable
medicine
chest
the
doctor
informed
him
in
his
quiet
way
that
he
intended
to
follow
the
insurgents
at
this
aristide
inwardly
pronounced
him
a
great
fool
at
last
he
himself
slunk
away
fearing
lest
the
others
should
entrust
the
care
of
the
town
to
him
a
post
which
he
deemed
exceptionally
perilous
the
insurgents
could
not
think
of
keeping
plassans
in
their
power
the
town
was
animated
by
so
reactionary
a
spirit
that
it
seemed
impossible
even
to
establish
a
democratic
municipal
commission
there
as
had
already
been
done
in
other
places
so
they
would
simply
have
gone
off
without
taking
any
further
steps
if
macquart
prompted
and
emboldened
by
his
own
private
animosities
had
not
offered
to
hold
plassans
in
awe
on
condition
that
they
left
him
twenty
determined
men
these
men
were
given
him
and
at
their
head
he
marched
off
triumphantly
to
take
possession
of
the
meantime
the
column
of
insurgents
was
wending
its
way
along
the
cours
sauvaire
and
making
its
exit
by
the
grand
leaving
the
streets
which
it
had
traversed
like
a
tempest
silent
and
deserted
in
its
rear
the
high
road
whitened
by
the
moonshine
stretched
far
into
the
distance
miette
had
refused
the
support
of
silvere
s
arm
she
marched
on
bravely
steady
and
upright
holding
the
red
flag
aloft
with
both
hands
without
complaining
of
the
cold
which
was
turning
her
fingers
blue
chapter
v
the
high
roads
stretched
far
way
white
with
moonlight
the
insurrectionary
army
was
continuing
its
heroic
march
through
the
cold
clear
country
it
was
like
a
mighty
wave
of
enthusiasm
the
thrill
of
patriotism
which
transported
miette
and
silvere
big
children
that
they
were
eager
for
love
and
liberty
sped
with
generous
fervour
athwart
the
sordid
intrigues
of
the
macquarts
and
the
rougons
at
intervals
the
of
the
people
rose
and
drowned
the
prattle
of
the
yellow
and
the
hateful
discourses
of
uncle
antoine
and
vulgar
ignoble
farce
was
turned
into
a
great
historical
drama
on
quitting
plassans
the
insurgents
had
taken
the
road
to
orcheres
they
expected
to
reach
that
town
at
about
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
road
skirts
the
course
of
the
viorne
following
at
some
height
the
windings
of
the
hillocks
below
which
the
torrent
flows
on
the
left
the
plain
spreads
out
like
an
immense
green
carpet
dotted
here
and
there
with
grey
villages
on
the
right
the
chain
of
the
garrigues
rears
its
desolate
peaks
its
plateaux
of
stones
its
huge
rusty
boulders
that
look
as
though
they
had
been
reddened
by
the
sun
the
high
road
embanked
along
the
riverside
passes
on
amidst
enormous
rocks
between
which
glimpses
of
the
valley
are
caught
at
every
step
nothing
could
be
wilder
or
more
strikingly
grand
than
this
road
out
of
the
hillside
at
night
time
especially
it
inspires
one
with
a
feeling
of
deep
awe
the
insurgents
advanced
under
the
pale
light
along
what
seemed
the
chief
street
of
some
ruined
town
bordered
on
either
side
with
fragments
of
temples
the
moon
turned
each
rock
into
a
broken
column
crumbling
capital
or
stretch
of
wall
pierced
with
mysterious
arches
on
high
slumbered
the
mass
of
the
garrigues
suffused
with
a
milky
tinge
and
resembling
some
immense
cyclopean
city
whose
towers
obelisks
houses
and
high
terraces
hid
one
half
of
the
heavens
and
in
the
depths
below
on
the
side
of
the
plain
was
a
spreading
ocean
of
diffused
light
vague
and
limitless
over
which
floated
masses
of
luminous
haze
the
insurrectionary
force
might
well
have
thought
they
were
following
some
gigantic
causeway
making
their
rounds
along
some
military
road
built
on
the
shore
of
a
phosphorescent
sea
and
circling
some
unknown
babel
on
the
night
in
question
the
viorne
roared
hoarsely
at
the
foot
of
the
rocks
bordering
the
route
amidst
the
continuous
rumbling
of
the
torrent
the
insurgents
could
distinguish
the
sharp
wailing
notes
of
the
tocsin
the
villages
scattered
about
the
plain
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
were
rising
sounding
and
lighting
signal
fires
till
daybreak
the
marching
column
which
the
persistent
tolling
of
a
mournful
knell
seemed
to
pursue
in
the
darkness
thus
beheld
the
insurrection
spreading
along
the
valley
like
a
train
of
powder
the
fires
showed
in
the
darkness
like
stains
of
blood
echoes
of
distant
songs
were
wafted
to
them
the
whole
vague
distance
blurred
by
the
whitish
vapours
of
the
moon
stirred
confusedly
and
suddenly
broke
into
a
spasm
of
anger
for
leagues
and
leagues
the
scene
remained
the
same
these
men
marching
on
under
the
blind
impetus
of
the
fever
with
which
the
events
in
paris
had
inspired
republican
hearts
became
elated
at
seeing
that
long
stretch
of
country
quivering
with
revolt
intoxicated
with
enthusiastic
belief
in
the
general
insurrection
of
which
they
dreamed
they
fancied
that
france
was
following
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
viorne
in
that
vast
ocean
of
diffused
light
they
imagined
there
were
endless
files
of
men
rushing
like
themselves
to
the
defence
of
the
republic
all
simplicity
and
delusion
as
multitudes
so
often
are
they
imagined
in
their
uncultured
minds
that
victory
was
easy
and
certain
they
would
have
seized
and
shot
as
a
traitor
any
one
who
had
then
asserted
that
they
were
the
only
ones
who
had
the
courage
of
their
duty
and
that
the
rest
of
the
country
overwhelmed
with
fright
was
pusillanimously
allowing
itself
to
be
garrotted
they
derived
fresh
courage
too
from
the
welcome
accorded
to
them
by
the
few
localities
that
lay
along
their
route
on
the
slopes
of
the
garrigues
the
inhabitants
rose
immediately
the
little
army
drew
near
women
ran
to
meet
them
wishing
them
a
speedy
victory
while
men
half
clad
seized
the
first
weapons
they
could
find
and
rushed
to
join
their
ranks
there
was
a
fresh
ovation
at
every
village
shouts
of
welcome
and
farewell
many
times
reiterated
towards
daybreak
the
moon
disappeared
behind
the
garrigues
and
the
insurgents
continued
their
rapid
march
amidst
the
dense
darkness
of
a
winter
night
they
were
now
unable
to
distinguish
the
valley
or
the
hills
they
heard
only
the
hoarse
plaints
of
the
bells
sounding
through
the
deep
obscurity
like
invisible
drums
hidden
they
knew
not
where
but
ever
goading
them
on
with
despairing
calls
miette
and
silvere
went
on
all
eagerness
like
the
others
towards
daybreak
the
girl
suffered
greatly
from
fatigue
she
could
only
walk
with
short
hurried
steps
and
was
unable
to
keep
up
with
the
long
strides
of
the
men
who
surrounded
her
nevertheless
she
courageously
strove
to
suppress
all
complaints
it
would
have
cost
her
too
much
to
confess
that
she
was
not
as
strong
as
a
boy
during
the
first
few
leagues
of
the
march
silvere
gave
her
his
arm
then
seeing
that
the
standard
was
gradually
slipping
from
her
benumbed
hands
he
tried
to
take
it
in
order
to
relieve
her
but
she
grew
angry
and
would
only
allow
him
to
hold
it
with
one
hand
while
she
continued
to
carry
it
on
her
shoulder
she
thus
maintained
her
heroic
demeanour
with
childish
stubbornness
smiling
at
the
young
man
each
time
he
gave
her
a
glance
of
loving
anxiety
at
last
when
the
moon
hid
itself
she
gave
way
in
the
sheltering
darkness
silvere
felt
her
leaning
more
heavily
on
his
arm
he
now
had
to
carry
the
flag
and
hold
her
round
the
waist
to
prevent
her
from
stumbling
nevertheless
she
still
made
no
complaint
are
you
very
tired
poor
miette
silvere
asked
her
yea
a
little
tired
she
replied
in
a
weary
tone
would
you
like
to
rest
a
bit
she
made
no
reply
but
he
realised
that
she
was
staggering
he
thereupon
handed
the
flag
to
one
of
the
other
insurgents
and
quitted
the
ranks
almost
carrying
the
girl
in
his
arms
she
struggled
a
little
she
felt
so
distressed
at
appearing
such
a
child
but
he
calmed
her
telling
her
that
he
knew
of
a
which
shortened
the
distance
by
one
half
they
would
be
able
to
take
a
good
hour
s
rest
and
reach
orcheres
at
the
same
time
as
the
others
it
was
then
six
o
clock
there
must
have
been
a
slight
mist
rising
from
the
viorne
for
the
darkness
seemed
to
be
growing
denser
the
young
people
groped
their
way
along
the
slope
of
the
garrigues
till
they
came
to
a
rock
on
which
they
sat
down
around
them
lay
an
abyss
of
darkness
they
were
stranded
as
it
were
on
some
reef
above
a
dense
void
and
athwart
that
void
when
the
dull
tramp
of
the
little
army
had
died
away
they
only
heard
two
bells
the
one
clear
toned
and
ringing
doubtless
at
their
feet
in
some
village
across
the
road
and
the
other
and
faint
responding
as
it
were
with
distant
sobs
to
the
feverish
plaints
of
the
first
one
might
have
thought
that
these
bells
were
recounting
to
each
other
through
the
empty
waste
the
sinister
story
of
a
perishing
world
miette
and
silvere
warmed
by
their
quick
march
did
not
at
first
feel
the
cold
they
remained
silent
listening
in
great
dejection
to
the
sounds
of
the
tocsin
which
made
the
darkness
quiver
they
could
not
even
see
one
another
miette
felt
frightened
and
seeking
for
silvere
s
hand
clasped
it
in
her
own
after
the
feverish
enthusiasm
which
for
several
hours
had
carried
them
along
with
the
others
this
sudden
halt
and
the
solitude
in
which
they
found
themselves
side
by
side
left
them
exhausted
and
bewildered
as
though
they
had
suddenly
awakened
from
a
strange
dream
they
felt
as
if
a
wave
had
cast
them
beside
the
highway
then
ebbed
back
and
left
them
stranded
irresistible
reaction
plunged
them
into
listless
stupor
they
forgot
their
enthusiasm
they
thought
no
more
of
the
men
whom
they
had
to
rejoin
they
surrendered
themselves
to
the
melancholy
sweetness
of
finding
themselves
alone
hand
in
hand
in
the
midst
of
the
wild
darkness
you
are
not
angry
with
me
the
girl
at
length
inquired
i
could
easily
walk
the
whole
night
with
you
but
they
were
running
too
quickly
i
could
hardly
why
should
i
be
angry
with
you
the
young
man
said
i
don
t
know
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
love
me
any
longer
i
wish
i
could
have
taken
long
strides
like
you
and
have
walked
along
without
stopping
you
will
think
i
am
a
silvere
smiled
and
miette
though
the
darkness
prevented
her
from
seeing
him
guessed
that
he
was
doing
so
then
she
continued
with
determination
you
must
not
always
treat
me
like
a
sister
i
want
to
be
your
wife
some
forthwith
she
clasped
silvere
to
her
bosom
and
still
with
her
arms
about
him
murmured
we
shall
grow
so
cold
come
close
to
me
that
we
may
be
then
they
lapsed
into
silence
until
that
troublous
hour
they
had
loved
one
another
with
the
affection
of
brother
and
sister
in
their
ignorance
they
still
mistook
their
feelings
for
tender
friendship
although
beneath
their
guileless
love
their
ardent
blood
surged
more
wildly
day
by
day
given
age
and
experience
a
violent
passion
of
southern
intensity
would
at
last
spring
from
this
idyll
every
girl
who
hangs
on
a
youth
s
neck
is
already
a
woman
a
woman
unconsciously
whom
a
caress
may
awaken
to
conscious
womanhood
when
lovers
kiss
on
the
cheeks
it
is
because
they
are
searching
feeling
for
one
another
s
lips
lovers
are
made
by
a
kiss
it
was
on
that
dark
and
cold
december
night
amid
the
bitter
wailing
of
the
tocsin
that
miette
and
silvere
exchanged
one
of
those
kisses
that
bring
all
the
heart
s
blood
to
the
lips
they
remained
silent
close
to
one
another
a
gentle
glow
soon
penetrated
them
languor
overcame
them
and
steeped
them
in
feverish
drowsiness
they
were
quite
warm
at
last
and
lights
seemed
to
flit
before
their
closed
eyelids
while
a
buzzing
mounted
to
their
brains
this
state
of
painful
ecstasy
which
lasted
some
minutes
seemed
endless
to
them
then
in
a
kind
of
dream
their
lips
met
the
kiss
they
exchanged
was
long
and
greedy
it
seemed
to
them
as
if
they
had
never
kissed
before
yet
their
embrace
was
fraught
with
suffering
and
they
released
one
another
and
the
chilliness
of
the
night
having
cooled
their
fever
they
remained
in
great
confusion
at
some
distance
one
from
the
other
meantime
the
bells
were
keeping
up
their
sinister
converse
in
the
dark
abyss
which
surrounded
the
young
people
miette
trembling
and
frightened
did
not
dare
to
draw
near
to
silvere
again
she
did
not
even
know
if
he
were
still
there
for
she
could
no
longer
hear
him
move
the
stinging
sweetness
of
their
kiss
still
clung
to
their
lips
to
which
passionate
phrases
surged
and
they
longed
to
kiss
once
more
but
shame
restrained
them
from
the
expression
of
any
such
desire
they
felt
that
they
would
rather
never
taste
that
bliss
again
than
speak
of
it
aloud
if
their
blood
had
not
been
lashed
by
their
rapid
march
if
the
darkness
had
not
offered
complicity
they
would
for
a
long
time
yet
have
continued
kissing
each
other
on
the
cheeks
like
old
playfellows
feelings
of
modesty
were
coming
to
miette
she
remembered
justin
s
coarseness
a
few
hours
previously
she
had
listened
without
a
blush
to
that
fellow
who
called
her
a
shameless
girl
she
had
wept
without
understanding
his
meaning
she
had
wept
simply
because
she
guessed
that
what
he
spoke
of
must
be
base
now
that
she
was
becoming
a
woman
she
wondered
in
a
last
innocent
transport
whether
that
kiss
whose
burning
smart
she
could
still
feel
would
not
perhaps
suffice
to
cover
her
with
the
shame
to
which
her
cousin
had
referred
thereupon
she
was
seized
with
remorse
and
burst
into
sobs
what
is
the
matter
why
are
you
crying
asked
silvere
in
an
anxious
voice
oh
leave
me
she
faltered
i
do
not
then
in
spite
of
herself
as
it
were
she
continued
amidst
her
tears
ah
what
an
unfortunate
creature
i
am
when
i
was
ten
years
old
people
used
to
throw
stones
at
me
i
am
treated
as
the
vilest
of
creatures
justin
did
right
to
despise
me
before
everybody
we
have
been
doing
wrong
the
young
man
quite
dismayed
clasped
her
in
his
arms
again
trying
to
console
her
i
love
you
he
whispered
i
am
your
brother
why
say
that
we
have
been
doing
wrong
we
kissed
each
other
because
we
were
cold
you
know
very
well
that
we
used
to
kiss
each
other
every
evening
before
oh
not
as
we
did
just
now
she
whispered
it
must
be
wrong
for
a
strange
feeling
came
over
me
the
men
will
laugh
at
me
now
as
i
pass
and
they
will
be
right
in
doing
so
i
shall
not
be
able
to
defend
the
young
fellow
remained
silent
unable
to
find
a
word
to
calm
the
agitation
of
this
big
child
trembling
at
her
first
kiss
of
love
he
clasped
her
gently
imagining
that
he
might
calm
her
by
his
embrace
she
struggled
however
and
continued
if
you
like
we
will
go
away
we
will
leave
the
province
i
can
never
return
to
plassans
my
uncle
would
beat
me
all
the
townspeople
would
point
their
fingers
at
me
and
then
as
if
seized
with
sudden
irritation
she
added
but
no
i
am
cursed
i
forbid
you
to
leave
aunt
dide
to
follow
me
you
must
leave
me
on
the
miette
miette
silvere
implored
don
t
talk
like
yes
i
want
to
please
you
be
reasonable
they
have
turned
me
out
like
a
vagabond
if
i
went
back
with
you
you
would
always
be
fighting
for
my
sake
and
i
don
t
want
at
this
the
young
man
again
pressed
a
kiss
upon
her
lips
murmuring
you
shall
be
my
wife
and
nobody
will
then
dare
to
hurt
oh
please
i
entreat
you
she
said
with
a
stifled
cry
don
t
kiss
me
so
you
hurt
then
after
a
short
silence
you
know
quite
well
that
i
can
not
be
your
wife
now
we
are
too
young
you
would
have
to
wait
for
me
and
meanwhile
i
should
die
of
shame
you
are
wrong
in
protesting
you
will
be
forced
to
leave
me
in
some
at
this
silvere
his
fortitude
exhausted
began
to
cry
a
man
s
sobs
are
fraught
with
distressing
hoarseness
miette
quite
frightened
as
she
felt
the
poor
fellow
shaking
in
her
arms
kissed
him
on
the
face
forgetting
she
was
burning
her
lips
but
it
was
all
her
fault
she
was
a
little
simpleton
to
have
let
a
kiss
upset
her
so
completely
she
now
clasped
her
lover
to
her
bosom
as
if
to
beg
forgiveness
for
having
pained
him
these
weeping
children
so
anxiously
clasping
one
another
made
the
dark
night
yet
more
woeful
than
before
in
the
distance
the
bells
continued
to
complain
unceasingly
in
panting
accents
it
is
better
to
die
repeated
silvere
amidst
his
sobs
it
is
better
to
don
t
cry
forgive
me
stammered
miette
i
will
be
brave
i
will
do
all
you
when
the
young
man
had
dried
his
tears
you
are
right
he
said
we
can
not
return
to
plassans
but
the
time
for
cowardice
has
not
yet
come
if
we
come
out
of
the
struggle
triumphant
i
will
go
for
aunt
dide
and
we
will
take
her
ever
so
far
away
with
us
if
we
are
beaten
he
stopped
if
we
are
beaten
repeated
miette
softly
then
be
it
as
god
wills
continued
silvere
in
a
softer
voice
i
most
likely
shall
not
be
there
you
will
comfort
the
poor
woman
that
would
be
ah
as
you
said
just
now
the
young
girl
murmured
it
would
be
better
to
at
this
longing
for
death
they
tightened
their
embrace
miette
relied
upon
dying
with
silvere
he
had
only
spoken
of
himself
but
she
felt
that
he
would
gladly
take
her
with
him
into
the
earth
they
would
there
be
able
to
love
each
other
more
freely
than
under
the
sun
aunt
dide
would
die
likewise
and
join
them
it
was
so
to
say
a
rapid
presentiment
a
desire
for
some
strange
voluptuousness
to
which
heaven
by
the
mournful
accents
of
the
tocsin
was
promising
early
gratification
to
die
to
die
the
bells
repeated
these
words
with
increasing
passion
and
the
lovers
yielded
to
the
calls
of
the
darkness
they
fancied
they
experienced
a
foretaste
of
the
last
sleep
in
the
drowsiness
into
which
they
again
sank
whilst
their
lips
met
once
more
miette
no
longer
turned
away
it
was
she
now
who
pressed
her
lips
to
silvere
s
who
sought
with
mute
ardour
for
the
delight
whose
stinging
smart
she
had
not
at
first
been
able
to
endure
the
thought
of
approaching
death
had
excited
her
she
no
longer
felt
herself
blushing
but
hung
upon
her
love
while
he
in
faltering
voice
repeated
i
love
you
i
love
you
but
at
this
miette
shook
her
head
as
if
to
say
it
was
not
true
with
her
free
and
ardent
nature
she
had
a
secret
instinct
of
the
meaning
and
purposes
of
life
and
though
she
was
right
willing
to
die
she
would
fain
have
known
life
first
at
last
growing
calmer
she
gently
rested
her
head
on
the
young
man
s
shoulder
without
uttering
a
word
silvere
kissed
her
again
she
tasted
those
kisses
slowly
seeking
their
meaning
their
hidden
sweetness
as
she
felt
them
course
through
her
veins
she
interrogated
them
asking
if
they
were
all
love
all
passion
but
languor
at
last
overcame
her
and
she
fell
into
gentle
slumber
silvere
had
enveloped
her
in
her
pelisse
drawing
the
skirt
around
himself
at
the
same
time
they
no
longer
felt
cold
the
young
man
rejoiced
to
find
from
the
regularity
of
her
breathing
that
the
girl
was
now
asleep
this
repose
would
enable
them
to
proceed
on
their
way
with
spirit
he
resolved
to
let
her
slumber
for
an
hour
the
sky
was
still
black
and
the
approach
of
day
was
but
faintly
indicated
by
a
whitish
line
in
the
east
behind
the
lovers
there
must
have
been
a
pine
wood
whose
musical
awakening
it
was
that
the
young
man
heard
amidst
the
morning
breezes
and
meantime
the
wailing
of
the
bells
grew
more
sonorous
in
the
quivering
atmosphere
lulling
miette
s
slumber
even
as
it
had
accompanied
her
passionate
fever
until
that
troublous
night
these
young
people
had
lived
through
one
of
those
innocent
idylls
that
blossom
among
the
toiling
masses
those
outcasts
and
folks
of
simple
mind
amidst
whom
one
may
yet
occasionally
find
amours
as
primitive
as
those
of
the
ancient
greek
romances
miette
had
been
scarcely
nine
years
old
at
the
time
when
her
father
was
sent
to
the
galleys
for
shooting
a
gendarme
the
trial
of
chantegreil
had
remained
a
memorable
case
in
the
province
the
poacher
boldly
confessed
that
he
had
killed
the
gendarme
but
he
swore
that
the
latter
had
been
taking
aim
at
him
i
only
anticipated
him
he
said
i
defended
myself
it
was
a
duel
not
a
he
never
desisted
from
this
line
of
argument
the
presiding
judge
of
the
assizes
could
not
make
him
understand
that
although
a
gendarme
has
the
right
to
fire
upon
a
poacher
a
poacher
has
no
right
to
fire
upon
a
gendarme
chantegreil
escaped
the
guillotine
owing
to
his
obviously
sincere
belief
in
his
own
innocence
and
his
previous
good
character
the
man
wept
like
a
child
when
his
daughter
was
brought
to
him
prior
to
his
departure
for
toulon
the
little
thing
who
had
lost
her
mother
in
her
infancy
dwelt
at
this
time
with
her
grandfather
at
chavanoz
a
village
in
the
passes
of
the
seille
when
the
poacher
was
no
longer
there
the
old
man
and
the
girl
lived
upon
alms
the
inhabitants
of
chavanoz
all
sportsmen
and
poachers
came
to
the
assistance
of
the
poor
creatures
whom
the
convict
had
left
behind
him
after
a
while
however
the
old
man
died
of
grief
and
miette
left
alone
by
herself
would
have
had
to
beg
on
the
high
roads
if
the
neighbours
had
not
remembered
that
she
had
an
aunt
at
plassans
a
charitable
soul
was
kind
enough
to
take
her
to
this
aunt
who
did
not
however
receive
her
very
kindly
eulalie
chantegreil
the
spouse
of
rebufat
was
a
big
dark
stubborn
creature
who
ruled
the
home
she
led
her
husband
by
the
noise
said
the
people
of
the
faubourg
of
plassans
the
truth
was
rebufat
avaricious
and
eager
for
work
and
gain
felt
a
sort
of
respect
for
this
big
creature
who
combined
uncommon
vigour
with
strict
sobriety
and
economy
thanks
to
her
the
household
thrived
the
grumbled
one
evening
when
on
returning
home
from
work
he
found
miette
installed
there
but
his
wife
closed
his
mouth
by
saying
in
her
gruff
voice
bah
the
little
thing
s
strongly
built
she
ll
do
for
a
servant
we
ll
keep
her
and
save
this
calculation
pleased
rebufat
he
went
so
far
as
to
feel
the
little
thing
s
arms
and
declared
with
satisfaction
that
she
was
sturdy
for
her
age
miette
was
then
nine
years
old
from
the
very
next
day
he
made
use
of
her
the
work
of
the
in
the
south
of
france
is
much
lighter
than
in
the
north
one
seldom
sees
them
employed
in
digging
the
ground
carrying
loads
or
doing
other
kinds
of
men
s
work
they
bind
sheaves
gather
olives
and
mulberry
leaves
perhaps
their
most
laborious
work
is
that
of
weeding
miette
worked
away
willingly
life
was
her
delight
her
health
so
long
as
her
aunt
lived
she
was
always
smiling
the
good
woman
in
spite
of
her
roughness
at
last
loved
her
as
her
own
child
she
forbade
her
doing
the
hard
work
which
her
husband
sometimes
tried
to
force
upon
her
saying
to
the
latter
ah
you
re
a
clever
fellow
you
don
t
understand
you
fool
that
if
you
tire
her
too
much
she
won
t
be
able
to
do
anything
this
argument
was
decisive
rebufat
bowed
his
head
and
carried
the
load
which
he
had
desired
to
set
on
the
young
girl
s
shoulders
the
latter
would
have
lived
in
perfect
happiness
under
the
secret
protection
of
her
aunt
eulalie
but
for
the
teasing
of
her
cousin
who
was
then
a
lad
of
sixteen
and
employed
his
idle
hours
in
hating
and
persecuting
her
justin
s
happiest
moments
were
those
when
by
means
of
some
gross
falsehood
he
succeeded
in
getting
her
scolded
whenever
he
could
tread
on
her
feet
or
push
her
roughly
pretending
not
to
have
seen
her
he
laughed
and
felt
the
delight
of
those
crafty
folks
who
rejoice
at
other
people
s
misfortunes
miette
however
would
stare
at
him
with
her
large
black
childish
eyes
gleaming
with
anger
and
silent
scorn
which
checked
the
cowardly
youngster
s
sneers
in
reality
he
was
terribly
afraid
of
his
cousin
the
young
girl
was
just
attaining
her
eleventh
year
when
her
aunt
eulalie
suddenly
died
from
that
day
everything
changed
in
the
house
rebufat
gradually
come
to
treat
her
like
a
he
overwhelmed
her
with
all
sorts
of
rough
work
and
made
use
of
her
as
a
beast
of
burden
she
never
even
complained
however
thinking
that
she
had
a
debt
of
gratitude
to
repay
him
in
the
evening
when
she
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
she
mourned
for
her
aunt
that
terrible
woman
whose
latent
kindliness
she
now
realised
however
it
was
not
the
hard
work
that
distressed
her
for
she
delighted
in
her
strength
and
took
a
pride
in
her
big
arms
and
broad
shoulders
what
distressed
her
was
her
uncle
s
distrustful
surveillance
his
continual
reproaches
and
the
irritated
manner
he
assumed
towards
her
she
had
now
become
a
stranger
in
the
house
yet
even
a
stranger
would
not
have
been
so
badly
treated
as
she
was
rebufat
took
the
most
unscrupulous
advantage
of
this
poor
little
relative
whom
he
pretended
to
keep
out
of
charity
she
repaid
his
harsh
hospitality
ten
times
over
with
her
work
and
yet
never
a
day
passed
but
he
grudged
her
the
bread
she
ate
justin
especially
excelled
in
wounding
her
since
his
mother
had
been
dead
seeing
her
without
a
protector
he
had
brought
all
his
evil
instincts
into
play
in
trying
to
make
the
house
intolerable
to
her
the
most
ingenious
torture
which
he
invented
was
to
speak
to
miette
of
her
father
the
poor
girl
living
away
from
the
world
under
the
protection
of
her
aunt
who
had
forbidden
any
one
ever
to
mention
the
words
galleys
or
convict
before
her
hardly
understood
their
meaning
it
was
justin
who
explained
it
to
her
by
relating
in
his
own
manner
the
story
of
the
murder
of
the
gendarme
and
chantegreil
s
conviction
there
was
no
end
to
the
horrible
particulars
he
supplied
the
convicts
had
a
cannonball
fastened
to
one
ankle
by
a
chain
they
worked
fifteen
hours
a
day
and
all
died
under
their
punishment
their
prison
too
was
a
frightful
place
the
horrors
of
which
he
described
minutely
miette
listened
to
him
stupefied
her
eyes
full
of
tears
sometimes
she
was
roused
to
sudden
violence
and
justin
quickly
retired
before
her
clenched
fists
however
he
took
a
savage
delight
in
thus
instructing
her
as
to
the
nature
of
prison
life
when
his
father
flew
into
a
passion
with
the
child
for
any
little
negligence
he
chimed
in
glad
to
be
able
to
insult
her
without
danger
and
if
she
attempted
to
defend
herself
he
would
exclaim
bah
bad
blood
always
shows
itself
you
ll
end
at
the
galleys
like
your
at
this
miette
sobbed
stung
to
the
heart
powerless
and
overwhelmed
with
shame
she
was
already
growing
to
womanhood
at
this
period
of
precocious
nature
she
endured
her
martyrdom
with
extraordinary
fortitude
she
rarely
gave
way
excepting
when
her
natural
pride
succumbed
to
her
cousin
s
outrages
soon
even
she
was
able
to
bear
without
a
tear
the
incessant
insults
of
this
cowardly
fellow
who
ever
watched
her
while
he
spoke
for
fear
lest
she
should
fly
at
his
face
then
too
she
learnt
to
silence
him
by
staring
at
him
fixedly
she
had
several
times
felt
inclined
to
run
away
from
the
but
she
did
not
do
so
as
her
courage
could
not
brook
the
idea
of
confessing
that
she
was
vanquished
by
the
persecution
she
endured
she
certainly
earned
her
bread
she
did
not
steal
the
rebufats
hospitality
and
this
conviction
satisfied
her
pride
so
she
remained
there
to
continue
the
struggle
stiffening
herself
and
living
on
with
the
one
thought
of
resistance
her
plan
was
to
do
her
work
in
silence
and
revenge
herself
for
all
harsh
treatment
by
mute
contempt
she
knew
that
her
uncle
derived
too
much
advantage
from
her
to
listen
readily
to
the
insinuations
of
justin
who
longed
to
get
her
turned
out
of
doors
and
in
a
defiant
spirit
she
resolved
that
she
would
not
go
away
of
her
own
accord
her
continuous
voluntary
silence
was
full
of
strange
fancies
passing
her
days
in
the
enclosure
isolated
from
all
the
world
she
formed
ideas
for
herself
which
would
have
strangely
shocked
the
good
people
of
the
faubourg
her
father
s
fate
particularly
occupied
her
thoughts
all
justin
s
abuse
recurred
to
her
and
she
ended
by
accepting
the
charge
of
murder
saying
to
herself
however
that
her
father
had
done
well
to
kill
the
gendarme
who
had
tried
to
kill
him
she
had
learnt
the
real
story
from
a
labourer
who
had
worked
for
a
time
at
the
from
that
moment
on
the
few
occasions
when
she
went
out
she
no
longer
even
turned
if
the
ragamuffins
of
the
faubourg
followed
her
crying
hey
la
chantegreil
she
simply
hastened
her
steps
homeward
with
lips
compressed
and
black
fierce
eyes
then
after
shutting
the
gate
she
perhaps
cast
one
long
glance
at
the
gang
of
urchins
she
would
have
become
vicious
have
lapsed
into
fierce
pariah
savagery
if
her
childishness
had
not
sometimes
gained
the
mastery
her
extreme
youth
brought
her
little
girlish
weaknesses
which
relieved
her
she
would
then
cry
with
shame
for
herself
and
her
father
she
would
hide
herself
in
a
stable
so
that
she
might
sob
to
her
heart
s
content
for
she
knew
that
if
the
others
saw
her
crying
they
would
torment
her
all
the
more
and
when
she
had
wept
sufficiently
she
would
bathe
her
eyes
in
the
kitchen
and
then
again
subside
into
uncomplaining
silence
it
was
not
interest
alone
however
which
prompted
her
to
hide
herself
she
carried
her
pride
in
her
precocious
strength
so
far
that
she
was
unwilling
to
appear
a
child
in
time
she
would
have
become
very
unhappy
fortunately
she
was
saved
by
discovering
the
latent
tenderness
of
her
loving
nature
the
well
in
the
yard
of
the
house
occupied
by
aunt
dide
and
silvere
was
a
the
wall
of
the
cut
it
in
halves
formerly
before
the
fouques
property
was
united
to
the
neighbouring
estate
the
had
used
this
well
daily
since
the
transfer
of
the
fouques
ground
however
as
it
was
at
some
distance
from
the
outhouses
the
inmates
of
the
jas
who
had
large
cisterns
at
their
disposal
did
not
draw
a
pail
of
water
from
it
in
a
month
on
the
other
side
one
could
hear
the
grating
of
the
pulley
every
morning
when
silvere
drew
the
water
for
aunt
dide
one
day
the
pulley
broke
the
young
wheelwright
made
a
good
strong
one
of
oak
and
put
it
up
in
the
evening
after
his
day
s
work
to
do
this
he
had
to
climb
upon
the
wall
when
he
had
finished
the
job
he
remained
resting
astride
the
coping
and
surveyed
with
curiosity
the
large
expanse
of
the
at
last
a
who
was
weeding
the
ground
a
few
feet
from
him
attracted
his
attention
it
was
in
july
and
the
air
was
broiling
although
the
sun
had
already
sank
to
the
horizon
the
had
taken
off
her
jacket
in
a
white
bodice
with
a
coloured
neckerchief
tied
over
her
shoulders
and
the
sleeves
of
her
chemise
turned
up
as
far
as
her
elbows
she
was
squatting
amid
the
folds
of
her
blue
cotton
skirt
which
was
secured
to
a
pair
of
braces
crossed
behind
her
back
she
crawled
about
on
her
knees
as
she
pulled
up
the
tares
and
threw
them
into
a
basket
the
young
man
could
only
see
her
bare
arms
stretching
out
right
and
left
to
seize
some
overlooked
weed
he
followed
this
rapid
play
of
her
arms
complacently
deriving
a
singular
pleasure
from
seeing
them
so
firm
and
quick
the
young
person
had
slightly
raised
herself
on
noticing
that
he
was
no
longer
at
work
but
had
again
lowered
her
head
before
he
could
distinguish
her
features
this
shyness
kept
him
in
suspense
like
an
inquisitive
lad
he
wondered
who
this
weeder
could
be
and
while
he
lingered
there
whistling
and
beating
time
with
a
chisel
the
latter
suddenly
slipped
out
of
his
hand
it
fell
into
the
striking
the
curb
of
the
well
and
then
bounding
a
few
feet
from
the
wall
silvere
looked
at
it
leaning
forward
and
hesitating
to
get
over
but
the
must
have
been
watching
the
young
man
askance
for
she
jumped
up
without
saying
anything
picked
up
the
chisel
and
handed
it
to
silvere
who
then
perceived
that
she
was
a
mere
child
he
was
surprised
and
rather
intimidated
the
young
girl
raised
herself
towards
him
in
the
red
glare
of
the
sunset
the
wall
at
this
spot
was
low
but
nevertheless
too
high
for
her
to
reach
him
so
he
bent
low
over
the
coping
while
she
still
raised
herself
on
tiptoes
they
did
not
speak
but
looked
at
each
other
with
an
air
of
smiling
confusion
the
young
man
would
indeed
have
liked
to
keep
the
girl
in
that
position
she
turned
to
him
a
charming
head
with
handsome
black
eyes
and
red
lips
which
quite
astonished
and
stirred
him
he
had
never
before
seen
a
girl
so
near
he
had
not
known
that
lips
and
eyes
could
be
so
pleasant
to
look
at
everything
about
the
girl
seemed
to
possess
a
strange
fascination
for
him
her
coloured
neckerchief
her
white
bodice
her
blue
cotton
skirt
hanging
from
braces
which
stretched
with
the
motion
of
her
shoulders
then
his
glance
glided
along
the
arm
which
was
handing
him
the
tool
as
far
as
the
elbow
this
arm
was
of
a
golden
brown
as
though
clothed
with
but
higher
up
in
the
shadow
of
the
sleeve
silvere
perceived
a
bare
roundness
at
this
he
felt
confused
however
he
leant
further
over
and
at
last
managed
to
grasp
the
chisel
the
little
was
becoming
embarrassed
still
they
remained
there
smiling
at
each
other
the
child
beneath
with
upturned
face
and
the
lad
half
reclining
on
the
coping
of
the
wall
they
could
not
part
from
each
other
so
far
they
had
not
exchanged
a
word
and
silvere
even
forgot
to
say
thank
what
s
your
name
he
asked
marie
replied
the
but
everybody
calls
me
again
she
raised
herself
slightly
and
in
a
clear
voice
inquired
in
her
turn
and
yours
my
name
is
silvere
the
young
workman
replied
a
pause
ensued
during
which
they
seemed
to
be
listening
complacently
to
the
music
of
their
names
i
m
fifteen
years
old
resumed
silvere
and
you
i
said
miette
oh
i
shall
be
eleven
on
all
saints
the
young
workman
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
ah
really
he
said
laughing
and
to
think
i
took
you
for
a
woman
you
ve
such
big
she
also
began
to
laugh
as
she
lowered
her
eyes
to
her
arms
then
they
ceased
speaking
they
remained
for
another
moment
gazing
and
smiling
at
each
other
and
finally
as
silvere
seemingly
had
no
more
questions
to
ask
her
miette
quietly
withdrew
and
went
on
plucking
her
weeds
without
raising
her
head
the
lad
for
his
part
remained
on
the
wall
for
a
while
the
sun
was
setting
a
stream
of
oblique
rays
poured
over
the
yellow
soil
of
the
which
seemed
to
be
all
ablaze
one
would
have
said
that
a
fire
was
running
along
the
ground
and
in
the
midst
of
the
flaming
expanse
silvere
saw
the
little
stooping
whose
bare
arms
had
resumed
their
rapid
motion
the
blue
cotton
skirt
was
now
becoming
white
and
rays
of
light
streamed
over
the
child
s
arms
at
last
silvere
felt
somewhat
ashamed
of
remaining
there
and
accordingly
got
off
the
wall
in
the
evening
preoccupied
with
his
adventure
he
endeavoured
to
question
aunt
dide
perhaps
she
would
know
who
this
miette
was
who
had
such
black
eyes
and
such
red
lips
but
since
she
had
lived
in
the
house
in
the
alley
the
old
woman
had
never
once
given
a
look
behind
the
wall
of
the
little
yard
it
was
to
her
like
an
impassable
rampart
which
shut
off
her
past
she
did
not
know
she
did
not
want
to
know
what
there
might
now
be
on
the
other
side
of
that
wall
in
that
old
enclosure
of
the
fouques
where
she
had
buried
her
love
her
heart
and
her
flesh
as
soon
as
silvere
began
to
question
her
she
looked
at
him
with
childish
terror
was
he
then
going
to
stir
up
the
ashes
of
those
days
now
dead
and
gone
and
make
her
weep
like
her
son
antoine
had
done
i
don
t
know
she
said
in
a
hasty
voice
i
no
longer
go
out
i
never
see
silvere
waited
the
morrow
with
considerable
impatience
and
as
soon
as
he
got
to
his
master
s
workshop
he
drew
his
into
conversation
he
did
not
say
anything
about
his
interview
with
miette
but
spoke
vaguely
of
a
girl
whom
he
had
seen
from
a
distance
in
the
oh
that
s
la
chantegreil
cried
one
of
the
workmen
there
was
no
necessity
for
silvere
to
question
them
further
for
they
told
him
the
story
of
the
poacher
chantegreil
and
his
daughter
miette
with
that
unreasoning
spite
which
is
felt
for
social
outcasts
the
girl
in
particular
they
treated
in
a
foul
manner
and
the
insulting
gibe
of
daughter
of
a
constantly
rose
to
their
lips
like
an
incontestable
reason
for
condemning
the
poor
dear
innocent
creature
to
eternal
disgrace
however
wheelwright
vian
an
honest
worthy
fellow
at
last
silenced
his
men
hold
your
tongues
you
foul
mouths
he
said
as
he
let
fall
the
shaft
of
a
cart
that
he
had
been
examining
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
for
being
so
hard
upon
the
child
i
ve
seen
her
the
little
thing
looks
a
very
good
girl
besides
i
m
told
she
doesn
t
mind
work
and
already
does
as
much
as
any
woman
of
thirty
there
are
some
lazy
fellows
here
who
aren
t
a
match
for
her
i
hope
later
on
that
she
ll
get
a
good
husband
who
ll
stop
this
evil
silvere
who
had
been
chilled
by
the
workmen
s
gross
jests
and
insults
felt
tears
rise
to
his
eyes
at
the
last
words
spoken
by
vian
however
he
did
not
open
his
lips
he
took
up
his
hammer
which
he
had
laid
down
near
him
and
began
with
all
his
might
to
strike
the
nave
of
a
wheel
which
he
was
binding
with
iron
in
the
evening
as
soon
as
he
had
returned
home
from
the
workshop
he
ran
to
the
wall
and
climbed
upon
it
he
found
miette
engaged
upon
the
same
labour
as
the
day
before
he
called
her
she
came
to
him
with
her
smile
of
embarrassment
and
the
charming
shyness
of
a
child
who
from
infancy
had
grown
up
in
tears
you
re
la
chantegreil
aren
t
you
he
asked
her
abruptly
she
recoiled
she
ceased
smiling
and
her
eyes
turned
sternly
black
gleaming
with
defiance
so
this
lad
was
going
to
insult
her
like
the
others
she
was
turning
her
back
upon
him
without
giving
an
answer
when
silvere
perplexed
by
her
sudden
change
of
countenance
hastened
to
add
stay
i
beg
you
i
don
t
want
to
pain
you
i
ve
got
so
many
things
to
tell
you
she
turned
round
still
distrustful
silvere
whose
heart
was
full
and
who
had
resolved
to
relieve
it
remained
for
a
moment
speechless
not
knowing
how
to
continue
for
he
feared
lest
he
should
commit
a
fresh
blunder
at
last
he
put
his
whole
heart
in
one
phrase
would
you
like
me
to
be
your
friend
he
said
in
a
voice
full
of
emotion
and
as
miette
in
surprise
raised
her
eyes
which
were
again
moist
and
smiling
he
continued
with
animation
i
know
that
people
try
to
vex
you
it
s
time
to
put
a
stop
to
it
i
will
be
your
protector
now
shall
i
the
child
beamed
with
delight
this
proffered
friendship
roused
her
from
all
her
evil
dreams
of
taciturn
hatred
still
she
shook
her
head
and
answered
no
i
don
t
want
you
to
fight
on
my
account
you
d
have
too
much
to
do
besides
which
there
are
persons
from
whom
you
can
not
protect
silvere
wished
to
declare
that
he
would
defend
her
against
the
whole
world
but
she
closed
his
mouth
with
a
coaxing
gesture
as
she
added
i
am
satisfied
to
have
you
as
a
they
then
conversed
together
for
a
few
minutes
lowering
their
voices
as
much
as
possible
miette
spoke
to
silvere
of
her
uncle
and
her
cousin
for
all
the
world
she
would
not
have
liked
them
to
catch
him
astride
the
coping
of
the
wall
justin
would
be
implacable
with
such
a
weapon
against
her
she
spoke
of
her
misgivings
with
the
fright
of
a
schoolgirl
on
meeting
a
friend
with
whom
her
mother
has
forbidden
her
to
associate
silvere
merely
understood
however
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
see
miette
at
his
pleasure
this
made
him
very
sad
still
he
promised
that
he
would
not
climb
upon
the
wall
any
more
they
were
both
endeavouring
to
find
some
expedient
for
seeing
each
other
again
when
miette
suddenly
begged
him
to
go
away
she
had
just
caught
sight
of
justin
who
was
crossing
the
grounds
in
the
direction
of
the
wall
silvere
quickly
descended
when
he
was
in
the
little
yard
again
he
remained
by
the
wall
to
listen
irritated
by
his
flight
after
a
few
minutes
he
ventured
to
climb
again
and
cast
a
glance
into
the
but
he
saw
justin
speaking
with
miette
and
quickly
withdrew
his
head
on
the
following
day
he
could
see
nothing
of
his
friend
not
even
in
the
distance
she
must
have
finished
her
work
in
that
part
of
the
jas
a
week
passed
in
this
fashion
and
the
young
people
had
no
opportunity
of
exchanging
a
single
word
silvere
was
in
despair
he
thought
of
boldly
going
to
the
rebufats
to
ask
for
miette
the
was
a
large
one
but
not
very
deep
on
either
side
of
the
wall
the
curb
formed
a
large
semicircle
the
water
was
only
ten
or
twelve
feet
down
at
the
utmost
this
slumbering
water
reflected
the
two
apertures
of
the
well
two
between
which
the
shadow
of
the
wall
cast
a
black
streak
on
leaning
over
one
might
have
fancied
in
the
vague
light
that
the
were
two
mirrors
of
singular
clearness
and
brilliance
under
the
morning
sunshine
when
the
dripping
of
the
ropes
did
not
disturb
the
surface
of
the
water
these
mirrors
these
reflections
of
the
heavens
showed
like
white
patches
on
the
green
water
and
in
them
the
leaves
of
the
ivy
which
had
spread
along
the
wall
over
the
well
were
repeated
with
marvellous
exactness
one
morning
at
an
early
hour
silvere
as
he
came
to
draw
water
for
aunt
dide
bent
over
the
well
mechanically
just
as
he
was
taking
hold
of
the
rope
he
started
and
then
stood
motionless
still
leaning
over
he
had
fancied
that
he
could
distinguish
in
the
well
the
face
of
a
young
girl
who
was
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
however
he
had
shaken
the
rope
and
the
disturbed
water
was
now
but
a
dim
mirror
that
no
longer
reflected
anything
clearly
silvere
who
did
not
venture
to
stir
and
whose
heart
beat
rapidly
then
waited
for
the
water
to
settle
as
its
ripples
gradually
widened
and
died
away
he
perceived
the
image
reappearing
it
oscillated
for
a
long
time
with
a
swing
which
lent
a
vague
grace
to
its
features
but
at
last
it
remained
stationary
it
was
the
smiling
countenance
of
miette
with
her
head
and
shoulders
her
coloured
neckerchief
her
white
bodice
and
her
blue
braces
silvere
next
perceived
his
own
image
in
the
other
mirror
then
knowing
that
they
could
see
each
other
they
nodded
their
heads
for
the
first
moment
they
did
not
even
think
of
speaking
at
last
they
exchanged
greetings
good
morning
good
morning
they
were
surprised
by
the
strange
sound
of
their
voices
which
became
singularly
soft
and
sweet
in
that
damp
hole
the
sound
seemed
indeed
to
come
from
a
distance
like
the
soft
music
of
voices
heard
of
an
evening
in
the
country
they
understood
that
it
would
suffice
to
speak
in
a
whisper
in
order
to
hear
each
other
the
well
echoed
the
faintest
breath
leaning
over
its
brink
they
conversed
while
gazing
at
one
another
s
reflection
miette
related
how
sad
she
had
been
the
last
week
she
was
now
working
at
the
other
end
of
the
jas
and
could
only
get
out
early
in
the
morning
then
she
made
a
pout
of
annoyance
which
silvere
distinguished
perfectly
and
to
which
he
replied
by
nodding
his
head
with
an
air
of
vexation
they
were
exchanging
all
those
gestures
and
facial
expressions
that
speech
entails
they
cared
but
little
for
the
wall
which
separated
them
now
that
they
could
see
each
other
in
those
hidden
depths
i
knew
continued
miette
with
a
knowing
look
that
you
came
here
to
draw
water
every
morning
at
the
same
hour
i
can
hear
the
grating
of
the
pulley
from
the
house
so
i
made
an
excuse
i
pretended
that
the
water
in
this
well
boiled
the
vegetables
better
i
thought
that
i
might
come
here
every
morning
to
draw
water
at
the
same
time
as
you
so
as
to
say
good
morning
to
you
without
anyone
suspecting
she
smiled
innocently
as
though
well
pleased
with
her
device
and
ended
by
saying
but
i
did
not
imagine
we
should
see
each
other
in
the
it
was
in
fact
this
pleasure
which
so
delighted
them
they
only
spoke
to
see
their
lips
move
so
greatly
did
this
new
frolic
amuse
their
childish
natures
and
they
resolved
to
use
all
means
in
their
power
to
meet
here
every
morning
when
miette
had
said
that
she
must
go
away
she
told
silvere
that
he
could
draw
his
pail
of
water
but
he
did
not
dare
to
shake
the
rope
miette
was
still
leaning
over
he
could
see
her
smiling
face
and
it
was
too
painful
to
him
to
dispel
that
smile
as
he
slightly
stirred
his
pail
the
water
murmured
and
the
smile
faded
then
he
stopped
seized
with
a
strange
fear
he
fancied
that
he
had
vexed
her
and
made
her
cry
but
the
child
called
to
him
go
on
go
on
with
a
laugh
which
the
echo
prolonged
and
rendered
more
sonorous
she
herself
then
nosily
sent
down
a
pail
there
was
a
perfect
tempest
everything
disappeared
under
the
black
water
and
silvere
made
up
his
mind
to
fill
two
pitchers
while
listening
to
the
retreating
steps
of
miette
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
from
that
day
the
young
people
never
missed
their
assignations
the
slumbering
water
the
white
mirrors
in
which
they
gazed
at
one
another
imparted
to
their
interviews
a
charm
which
long
sufficed
their
playful
childish
imaginations
they
had
no
desire
to
see
each
other
face
to
face
it
seemed
much
more
amusing
to
them
to
use
the
well
as
a
mirror
and
confide
their
morning
greetings
to
its
echo
they
soon
came
to
look
upon
the
well
as
an
old
friend
they
loved
to
bend
over
the
motionless
water
that
resembled
molten
silver
a
greenish
glimmer
hovered
below
in
a
mysterious
half
light
and
seemed
to
change
the
damp
hole
into
some
in
the
depths
of
a
wood
they
saw
each
other
in
a
sort
of
greenish
nest
bedecked
with
moss
in
the
midst
of
fresh
water
and
foliage
and
all
the
strangeness
of
the
deep
spring
the
hollow
tower
over
which
they
bent
trembling
with
fascination
added
unconfessed
and
delightful
fear
to
their
merry
laughter
the
wild
idea
occurred
to
them
of
going
down
and
seating
themselves
on
a
row
of
large
stones
which
formed
a
kind
of
circular
bench
at
a
few
inches
above
the
water
they
would
dip
their
feet
in
the
latter
converse
there
for
hours
and
no
one
would
think
of
coming
to
look
for
them
in
such
a
spot
but
when
they
asked
each
other
what
there
might
be
down
there
their
vague
fears
returned
they
thought
it
quite
sufficient
to
let
their
reflected
images
descend
into
the
depths
amidst
those
green
glimmers
which
tinged
the
stones
with
strange
reflections
and
amidst
those
mysterious
noises
which
rose
from
the
dark
corners
those
sounds
issuing
from
the
invisible
made
them
particularly
uneasy
they
often
fancied
that
voices
were
replying
to
their
own
and
then
they
would
remain
silent
detecting
a
thousand
faint
plaints
which
they
could
not
understand
these
came
from
the
secret
travail
of
the
moisture
the
sighs
of
the
atmosphere
the
drops
that
glided
over
the
stones
and
fell
below
with
the
sonorousness
of
sobs
they
would
nod
affectionately
to
each
other
in
order
to
reassure
themselves
thus
the
attraction
which
kept
them
leaning
over
the
brink
had
a
tinge
of
secret
terror
like
all
poignant
charms
but
the
well
still
remained
their
old
friend
it
was
such
an
excellent
pretext
for
meeting
justin
who
watched
miette
s
every
movement
never
suspected
the
cause
of
her
eagerness
to
go
and
draw
some
water
every
morning
at
times
he
saw
her
from
the
distance
leaning
over
and
loitering
ah
the
lazy
thing
he
muttered
how
fond
she
is
of
dawdling
about
how
could
he
suspect
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
there
was
a
wooer
contemplating
the
girl
s
smile
in
the
water
and
saying
to
her
if
that
donkey
justin
should
illtreat
you
just
tell
me
of
it
and
he
shall
hear
from
me
this
amusement
lasted
for
more
than
a
month
it
was
july
then
the
mornings
were
sultry
the
sun
shone
brightly
and
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
come
to
that
damp
spot
it
was
delightful
to
feel
the
cold
breath
of
the
well
on
one
s
face
and
make
love
amidst
this
spring
water
while
the
skies
were
kindling
their
fires
miette
would
arrive
out
of
breath
after
crossing
the
stubble
fields
as
she
ran
along
her
hair
fell
down
over
her
forehead
and
temples
and
it
was
with
flushed
face
and
dishevelled
locks
that
she
would
lean
over
shaking
with
laughter
almost
before
she
had
had
time
to
set
her
pitcher
down
silvere
who
was
almost
always
the
first
at
the
well
felt
as
he
suddenly
saw
her
smiling
face
in
the
water
as
keen
a
joy
as
he
would
have
experienced
had
she
suddenly
thrown
herself
into
his
arms
at
the
bend
of
a
pathway
around
them
the
radiant
morning
hummed
with
mirth
a
wave
of
warm
light
sonorous
with
the
buzzing
of
insects
beat
against
the
old
wall
the
posts
and
the
curbstone
they
however
no
longer
saw
the
shower
of
morning
sunshine
nor
heard
the
thousand
sounds
rising
from
the
ground
they
were
in
the
depths
of
their
green
under
the
earth
in
that
mysterious
and
awesome
cavity
and
quivered
with
pleasure
as
they
lingered
there
enjoying
its
fresh
coolness
and
dim
light
on
some
mornings
miette
who
by
nature
could
not
long
maintain
a
contemplative
attitude
began
to
tease
she
would
shake
the
rope
and
make
drops
of
water
fall
in
order
to
ripple
the
mirrors
and
deface
the
reflections
silvere
would
then
entreat
her
to
remain
still
he
whose
fervour
was
deeper
than
hers
knew
no
keener
pleasure
than
that
of
gazing
at
his
love
s
image
reflected
so
distinctly
in
every
feature
but
she
would
not
listen
to
him
she
would
joke
and
feign
a
rough
old
bogey
s
voice
to
which
the
echo
imparted
a
raucous
melodiousness
no
no
she
would
say
in
chiding
fashion
i
don
t
love
you
i
m
making
faces
at
you
see
how
ugly
i
and
she
laughed
at
seeing
the
fantastic
forms
which
their
spreading
faces
assumed
as
they
danced
upon
the
disturbed
water
one
morning
she
got
angry
in
real
earnest
she
did
not
find
silvere
at
the
and
waited
for
him
for
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
vainly
making
the
pulley
grate
she
was
just
about
to
depart
in
a
rage
when
he
arrived
as
soon
as
she
perceived
him
she
let
a
perfect
tempest
loose
in
the
well
shook
her
pail
in
an
irritated
manner
and
made
the
blackish
water
whirl
and
splash
against
the
stones
in
vain
did
silvere
try
to
explain
that
aunt
dide
had
detained
him
to
all
his
excuses
she
replied
you
ve
vexed
me
i
don
t
want
to
see
the
poor
lad
in
despair
vainly
questioned
that
sombre
cavity
now
so
full
of
lamentable
sounds
where
on
other
days
such
a
bright
vision
usually
awaited
him
amid
the
silence
of
the
stagnant
water
he
had
to
go
away
without
seeing
miette
on
the
morrow
arriving
before
the
time
he
gazed
sadly
into
the
well
hearing
nothing
and
thinking
that
the
obstinate
girl
would
not
come
when
she
who
was
already
on
the
other
side
slyly
watching
his
arrival
bent
over
suddenly
with
a
burst
of
laughter
all
was
at
once
forgotten
in
this
wise
the
well
was
the
scene
of
many
a
little
drama
and
comedy
that
happy
cavity
with
its
gleaming
mirrors
and
musical
echoes
quickly
ripened
their
love
they
endowed
it
with
such
strange
life
so
filled
it
with
their
youthful
love
that
long
after
they
had
ceased
to
come
and
lean
over
the
brink
silvere
as
he
drew
water
every
morning
would
fancy
he
could
see
miette
s
smiling
face
in
the
dim
light
that
still
quivered
with
the
joy
they
had
set
there
that
month
of
playful
love
rescued
miette
from
her
mute
despair
she
felt
a
revival
of
her
affections
her
happy
childish
carelessness
which
had
been
held
in
check
by
the
hateful
loneliness
in
which
she
lived
the
certainty
that
she
was
loved
by
somebody
and
that
she
was
no
longer
alone
in
the
world
enabled
her
to
endure
the
persecutions
of
justin
and
the
faubourg
urchins
a
song
of
joy
whose
glad
notes
drowned
their
hootings
now
sounded
in
her
heart
she
thought
of
her
father
with
tender
compassion
and
did
not
now
so
frequently
yield
to
dreams
of
bitter
vengeance
her
dawning
love
cooled
her
feverish
broodings
like
the
fresh
breezes
of
the
dawn
at
the
same
time
she
acquired
the
instinctive
cunning
of
a
young
girl
in
love
she
felt
that
she
must
maintain
her
usual
silent
and
rebellious
demeanour
if
she
were
to
escape
justin
s
suspicions
but
in
spite
of
her
efforts
her
eyes
retained
a
sweet
unruffled
expression
when
the
lad
bullied
her
she
was
no
longer
able
to
put
on
her
old
black
look
of
indignant
anger
one
morning
he
heard
her
humming
to
herself
at
you
seem
very
gay
chantegreil
he
said
to
her
suspiciously
glancing
keenly
at
her
from
his
lowering
eyes
i
bet
you
ve
been
up
to
some
of
your
tricks
again
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
but
she
trembled
inwardly
and
she
did
all
she
could
to
regain
her
old
appearance
of
rebellious
martyrdom
however
though
justin
suspected
some
secret
happiness
it
was
long
before
he
was
able
to
discover
how
his
victim
had
escaped
him
silvere
on
his
side
enjoyed
profound
happiness
his
daily
meetings
with
miette
made
his
idle
hours
pass
pleasantly
away
during
his
long
silent
companionship
with
aunt
dide
he
recalled
one
by
one
his
remembrances
of
the
morning
revelling
in
their
most
trifling
details
from
that
time
forward
the
fulness
of
his
heart
cloistered
him
yet
more
in
the
lonely
existence
which
he
had
adopted
with
his
grandmother
he
was
naturally
fond
of
hidden
spots
of
solitary
retirement
where
he
could
give
himself
up
to
his
thoughts
at
this
period
already
he
had
eagerly
begun
to
read
all
the
old
odd
volumes
which
he
could
pick
up
at
brokers
shops
in
the
faubourg
and
which
were
destined
to
lead
him
to
a
strange
and
generous
social
religion
and
morality
his
reading
and
lacking
all
solid
foundation
gave
him
glimpses
of
the
world
s
vanities
and
pleasures
especially
with
regard
to
women
which
would
have
seriously
troubled
his
mind
if
his
heart
had
not
been
contented
when
miette
came
he
received
her
at
first
as
a
companion
then
as
the
joy
and
ambition
of
his
life
in
the
evening
when
he
had
retired
to
the
little
nook
where
he
slept
and
hung
his
lamp
at
the
head
of
his
he
would
find
miette
on
every
page
of
the
dusty
old
volume
which
he
had
taken
at
random
from
a
shelf
above
his
head
and
was
reading
devoutly
he
never
came
across
a
young
girl
a
good
and
beautiful
creature
in
his
reading
without
immediately
identifying
her
with
his
sweetheart
and
he
would
set
himself
in
the
narrative
as
well
if
he
were
reading
a
love
story
it
was
he
who
married
miette
at
the
end
or
died
with
her
if
on
the
contrary
he
were
perusing
some
political
pamphlet
some
grave
dissertation
on
social
economy
works
which
he
preferred
to
romances
for
he
had
that
singular
partiality
for
difficult
subjects
which
characterises
persons
of
imperfect
scholarship
he
still
found
some
means
of
associating
her
with
the
tedious
themes
which
frequently
he
could
not
even
understand
for
instance
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
he
was
learning
how
to
be
good
and
kind
to
her
when
they
were
married
he
thus
associated
her
with
all
his
visionary
dreamings
protected
by
the
purity
of
his
affection
against
the
obscenity
of
certain
tales
which
fell
into
his
hands
he
found
particular
pleasure
in
shutting
himself
up
with
her
in
those
humanitarian
utopias
which
some
great
minds
of
our
own
time
infatuated
by
visions
of
universal
happiness
have
imagined
miette
in
his
mind
became
quite
essential
to
the
abolition
of
pauperism
and
the
definitive
triumph
of
the
principles
of
the
revolution
there
were
nights
of
feverish
reading
when
his
mind
could
not
tear
itself
from
his
book
which
he
would
lay
down
and
take
up
at
least
a
score
of
times
nights
of
voluptuous
weariness
which
he
enjoyed
till
daybreak
like
some
secret
orgie
cramped
up
in
that
tiny
room
his
eyes
troubled
by
the
flickering
yellow
light
while
he
yielded
to
the
fever
of
insomnia
and
schemed
out
new
social
schemes
of
the
most
absurdly
ingenuous
nature
in
which
woman
always
personified
by
miette
was
worshipped
by
the
nations
on
their
knees
he
was
predisposed
to
utopian
ideas
by
certain
hereditary
influences
his
grandmother
s
nervous
disorders
became
in
him
so
much
chronic
enthusiasm
striving
after
everything
that
was
grandiose
and
impossible
his
lonely
childhood
his
imperfect
education
had
developed
his
natural
tendencies
in
a
singular
manner
however
he
had
not
yet
reached
the
age
when
the
fixed
idea
plants
itself
in
a
man
s
mind
in
the
morning
after
he
had
dipped
his
head
in
a
bucket
of
water
he
remembered
his
thoughts
and
visions
of
the
night
but
vaguely
nothing
remained
of
his
dreams
save
a
childlike
innocence
full
of
trustful
confidence
and
yearning
tenderness
he
felt
like
a
child
again
he
ran
to
the
well
solely
desirous
of
meeting
his
sweetheart
s
smile
and
tasting
the
delights
of
the
radiant
morning
and
during
the
day
when
thoughts
of
the
future
sometimes
made
him
silent
and
dreamy
he
would
often
prompted
by
some
sudden
impulse
spring
up
and
kiss
aunt
dide
on
both
cheeks
whereat
the
old
woman
would
gaze
at
him
anxiously
perturbed
at
seeing
his
eyes
so
bright
and
gleaming
with
a
joy
which
she
thought
she
could
divine
at
last
as
time
went
on
miette
and
silvere
began
to
tire
of
only
seeing
each
other
s
reflection
the
novelty
of
their
play
was
gone
and
now
they
began
to
dream
of
keener
pleasures
than
the
well
could
afford
them
in
this
longing
for
reality
which
came
upon
them
there
was
the
wish
to
see
each
other
face
to
face
to
run
through
the
open
fields
and
return
out
of
breath
with
their
arms
around
each
other
s
waist
clinging
closely
together
in
order
that
they
might
the
better
feel
each
other
s
love
one
morning
silvere
spoke
of
climbing
over
the
wall
and
walking
in
the
jas
with
miette
but
the
child
implored
him
not
to
perpetrate
such
folly
which
would
place
her
at
justin
s
mercy
he
then
promised
to
seek
some
other
means
the
wall
in
which
the
well
was
set
made
a
sudden
bend
a
few
paces
further
on
thereby
forming
a
sort
of
recess
where
the
lovers
would
be
free
from
observation
if
they
were
to
take
shelter
there
the
question
was
how
to
reach
this
recess
silvere
could
no
longer
entertain
the
idea
of
climbing
over
as
miette
had
appeared
so
afraid
he
secretly
thought
of
another
plan
the
little
door
which
macquart
and
adelaide
had
set
up
one
night
long
years
previously
had
remained
forgotten
in
this
remote
corner
the
owner
of
the
had
not
even
thought
of
blocking
it
up
blackened
by
damp
and
green
with
moss
its
lock
and
hinges
eaten
away
with
rust
it
looked
like
a
part
of
the
old
wall
doubtless
the
key
was
lost
the
grass
growing
beside
the
lower
boards
against
which
slight
mounds
had
formed
amply
proved
that
no
one
had
passed
that
way
for
many
a
long
year
however
it
was
the
lost
key
that
silvere
hoped
to
find
he
knew
with
what
devotion
his
aunt
dide
allowed
the
relics
of
the
past
to
lie
rotting
wherever
they
might
be
he
searched
the
house
for
a
week
without
any
result
and
went
stealthily
night
by
night
to
see
if
he
had
at
last
put
his
hand
on
the
right
key
during
the
daytime
in
this
way
he
tried
more
than
thirty
keys
which
had
doubtless
come
from
the
old
property
of
the
fouques
and
which
he
found
all
over
the
place
against
the
walls
on
the
floors
and
at
the
bottom
of
drawers
he
was
becoming
disheartened
when
all
at
once
he
found
the
precious
key
it
was
simply
tied
by
a
string
to
the
street
door
which
always
remained
in
the
lock
it
had
hung
there
for
nearly
forty
years
aunt
dide
must
every
day
have
touched
it
with
her
hand
without
ever
making
up
her
mind
to
throw
it
away
although
it
could
now
only
carry
her
back
sorrowfully
into
the
past
when
silvere
had
convinced
himself
that
it
really
opened
the
little
door
he
awaited
the
ensuing
day
dreaming
of
the
joyful
surprise
which
he
was
preparing
for
miette
he
had
not
told
her
for
what
he
had
been
searching
on
the
morrow
as
soon
as
he
heard
the
girl
set
her
pitcher
down
he
gently
opened
the
door
sweeping
away
with
a
push
the
tall
weeds
which
covered
the
threshold
stretching
out
his
head
he
saw
miette
leaning
over
the
brink
of
the
well
looking
into
the
water
absorbed
in
expectation
thereupon
in
a
couple
of
strides
he
reached
the
recess
formed
by
the
wall
and
thence
called
miette
miette
in
a
soft
voice
which
made
her
tremble
she
raised
her
head
thinking
he
was
on
the
coping
of
the
wall
but
when
she
saw
him
in
the
jas
at
a
few
steps
from
her
she
gave
a
faint
cry
of
surprise
and
ran
up
to
him
they
took
each
other
s
hand
and
looked
at
one
another
delighted
to
be
so
near
thinking
themselves
far
handsomer
like
this
in
the
warm
sunshine
it
was
the
middle
of
august
the
feast
of
the
assumption
in
the
distance
the
bells
were
pealing
in
the
limpid
atmosphere
that
so
often
accompanies
great
days
of
festival
an
atmosphere
full
of
bright
gaiety
good
morning
silvere
good
morning
miette
the
voices
in
which
they
exchanged
their
morning
greetings
sounded
strange
to
them
they
knew
only
the
muffled
accents
transmitted
by
the
echo
of
the
well
and
now
their
voices
seemed
to
them
as
clear
as
the
notes
of
a
lark
and
ah
how
delightful
it
was
in
that
warm
corner
in
that
holiday
atmosphere
they
still
held
each
other
s
hands
silvere
leaning
against
the
wall
miette
with
her
figure
slightly
thrown
backwards
they
were
about
to
tell
each
other
all
the
soft
things
which
they
had
not
dared
to
confide
to
the
reverberations
of
the
well
when
silvere
hearing
a
slight
noise
started
and
turning
pale
dropped
miette
s
hands
he
had
just
seen
aunt
dide
standing
before
him
erect
and
motionless
on
the
threshold
of
the
doorway
the
grandmother
had
come
to
the
well
by
chance
and
on
perceiving
in
the
old
black
wall
the
white
gap
formed
by
the
doorway
which
silvere
had
left
wide
open
she
had
experienced
a
violent
shock
that
open
gap
seemed
to
her
like
a
gulf
of
light
violently
illumining
her
past
she
once
more
saw
herself
running
to
the
door
amidst
the
morning
brightness
and
crossing
the
threshold
full
of
the
transports
of
her
nervous
love
and
macquart
was
there
awaiting
her
she
hung
upon
his
neck
and
pressed
against
his
bosom
whilst
the
rising
sun
following
her
through
the
doorway
which
she
had
left
open
in
her
hurry
enveloped
them
with
radiance
it
was
a
sudden
vision
which
roused
her
cruelly
from
the
slumber
of
old
age
like
some
supreme
chastisement
and
awakened
a
multitude
of
bitter
memories
within
her
had
the
well
had
the
entire
wall
disappeared
beneath
the
earth
she
would
not
have
been
more
stupefied
she
had
never
thought
that
this
door
would
open
again
in
her
mind
it
had
been
walled
up
ever
since
the
hour
of
macquart
s
death
and
amidst
her
amazement
she
felt
angry
indignant
with
the
sacrilegious
hand
that
had
penetrated
this
violation
and
left
that
white
open
space
agape
like
a
yawning
tomb
she
stepped
forward
yielding
to
a
kind
of
fascination
and
halted
erect
within
the
framework
of
the
door
then
she
gazed
out
before
her
with
a
feeling
of
dolorous
surprise
she
had
certainly
been
told
that
the
old
enclosure
of
the
fouques
was
now
joined
to
the
but
she
would
never
have
thought
the
associations
of
her
youth
could
have
vanished
so
completely
it
seemed
as
though
some
tempest
had
carried
off
everything
that
her
memory
cherished
the
old
dwelling
the
large
the
beds
of
green
vegetables
all
had
disappeared
not
a
stone
not
a
tree
of
former
times
remained
and
instead
of
the
scene
amidst
which
she
had
grown
up
and
which
in
her
mind
s
eye
she
had
seen
but
yesterday
there
lay
a
strip
of
barren
soil
a
broad
patch
of
stubbles
bare
like
a
desert
henceforward
when
on
closing
her
eyes
she
might
try
to
recall
the
objects
of
the
past
that
stubble
would
always
appear
to
her
like
a
shroud
of
yellowish
drugget
spread
over
the
soil
in
which
her
youth
lay
buried
in
the
presence
of
that
unfamiliar
commonplace
scene
her
heart
died
as
it
were
a
second
time
now
all
was
completely
finally
ended
she
was
robbed
even
of
her
dreams
of
the
past
then
she
began
to
regret
that
she
had
yielded
to
the
attraction
of
that
white
opening
of
that
doorway
gaping
upon
the
days
which
were
now
for
ever
lost
she
was
about
to
retire
and
close
the
accursed
door
without
even
seeking
to
discover
who
had
opened
it
when
she
suddenly
perceived
miette
and
silvere
and
the
sight
of
the
two
young
lovers
who
with
hanging
heads
nervously
awaited
her
glance
kept
her
on
the
threshold
quivering
with
yet
keener
pain
she
now
understood
all
to
the
very
end
she
was
destined
to
picture
herself
there
clasped
in
macquart
s
arms
in
the
bright
sunshine
yet
a
second
time
had
the
door
served
as
an
accomplice
where
love
had
once
passed
there
was
it
passing
again
twas
the
eternal
and
endless
renewal
with
present
joys
and
future
tears
aunt
dide
could
only
see
the
tears
and
a
sudden
presentiment
showed
her
the
two
children
bleeding
with
stricken
hearts
overwhelmed
by
the
recollection
of
her
life
s
sorrow
which
this
spot
had
just
awakened
within
her
she
grieved
for
her
dear
silvere
she
alone
was
guilty
if
she
had
not
formerly
had
that
door
made
silvere
would
not
now
be
at
a
girl
s
feet
in
that
lonely
nook
intoxicating
himself
with
a
bliss
which
prompts
and
angers
the
jealousy
of
death
after
a
brief
pause
she
went
up
to
the
young
man
and
without
a
word
took
him
by
the
hand
she
might
perhaps
have
left
them
there
chattering
under
the
wall
had
she
not
felt
that
she
herself
was
to
some
extent
an
accomplice
in
this
fatal
love
as
she
came
back
with
silvere
she
turned
on
hearing
the
light
footfall
of
miette
who
having
quickly
taken
up
her
pitcher
was
hastening
across
the
stubble
she
was
running
wildly
glad
at
having
escaped
so
easily
and
aunt
dide
smiled
involuntarily
as
she
watched
her
bound
over
the
ground
like
a
runaway
goat
she
is
very
young
she
murmured
she
has
plenty
of
she
meant
no
doubt
that
miette
had
plenty
of
time
before
her
to
suffer
and
weep
then
turning
her
eyes
upon
silvere
who
with
a
glance
of
ecstasy
had
followed
the
child
as
she
ran
off
in
the
bright
sunshine
she
simply
added
take
care
my
boy
this
sort
of
thing
sometimes
kills
these
were
the
only
words
she
spoke
with
reference
to
the
incident
which
had
awakened
all
the
sorrows
that
lay
slumbering
in
the
depths
of
her
being
silence
had
become
a
real
religion
with
her
when
silvere
came
in
she
the
door
and
threw
the
key
down
the
well
in
this
wise
she
felt
certain
that
the
door
would
no
longer
make
her
an
accomplice
she
examined
it
for
a
moment
glad
at
seeing
it
reassume
its
usual
gloomy
aspect
the
tomb
was
closed
once
more
the
white
gap
was
for
ever
boarded
up
with
that
mossy
timber
over
which
the
snails
had
shed
silvery
tears
in
the
evening
aunt
dide
had
another
of
those
nervous
attacks
which
came
upon
her
at
intervals
at
these
times
she
would
often
talk
aloud
and
ramble
incoherently
as
though
she
was
suffering
from
nightmare
that
evening
while
silvere
held
her
down
on
her
bed
he
heard
her
stammer
in
a
panting
voice
such
words
as
officer
fire
and
and
she
struggled
and
begged
for
mercy
and
dreamed
aloud
of
vengeance
at
last
as
always
happened
when
the
attack
was
drawing
to
a
close
she
fell
into
a
strange
fright
her
teeth
chattering
while
her
limbs
quivered
with
abject
terror
finally
after
raising
herself
into
a
sitting
posture
she
cast
a
haggard
look
of
astonishment
at
one
and
another
corner
of
the
room
and
then
fell
back
upon
the
pillow
heaving
deep
sighs
she
was
doubtless
a
prey
to
some
hallucination
however
she
drew
silvere
to
her
bosom
and
seemed
to
some
degree
to
recognise
him
though
ever
and
anon
she
confused
him
with
someone
else
there
they
are
she
stammered
do
you
see
they
are
going
to
take
you
they
will
kill
you
again
i
don
t
want
them
to
send
them
away
tell
them
i
won
t
tell
them
they
are
hurting
me
staring
at
me
like
that
then
she
turned
to
the
wall
to
avoid
seeing
the
people
of
whom
she
was
talking
and
after
an
interval
of
silence
she
continued
you
are
near
me
my
child
aren
t
you
you
must
not
leave
me
i
thought
i
was
going
to
die
just
now
we
did
wrong
to
make
an
opening
in
the
wall
i
have
suffered
ever
since
i
was
certain
that
door
would
bring
us
further
misfortune
oh
the
innocent
darlings
what
sorrow
they
will
kill
them
as
well
they
will
be
shot
down
like
then
she
relapsed
into
catalepsy
she
was
no
longer
even
aware
of
silvere
s
presence
suddenly
however
she
sat
up
and
gazed
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
with
a
fearful
expression
of
terror
why
didn
t
you
send
them
away
she
cried
hiding
her
white
head
against
the
young
man
s
breast
they
are
still
there
the
one
with
the
gun
is
making
signs
that
he
is
going
to
shortly
afterwards
she
fell
into
the
heavy
slumber
that
usually
terminated
these
attacks
on
the
next
day
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
everything
she
never
again
spoke
to
silvere
of
the
morning
on
which
she
had
found
him
with
a
sweetheart
behind
the
wall
the
young
people
did
not
see
each
other
for
a
couple
of
days
when
miette
ventured
to
return
to
the
well
they
resolved
not
to
recommence
the
pranks
which
had
upset
aunt
dide
however
the
meeting
which
had
been
so
strangely
interrupted
had
filled
them
with
a
keen
desire
to
meet
again
in
some
happy
solitude
weary
of
the
delights
afforded
by
the
well
and
unwilling
to
vex
aunt
dide
by
seeing
miette
again
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
silvere
begged
the
girl
to
meet
him
somewhere
else
she
required
but
little
pressing
she
received
the
proposal
with
the
willing
smile
of
a
frolicsome
lass
who
has
no
thought
of
evil
what
made
her
smile
was
the
idea
of
outwitting
that
spy
of
a
justin
when
the
lovers
had
come
to
agreement
they
discussed
at
length
the
choice
of
a
favourable
spot
silvere
proposed
the
most
impossible
he
planned
regular
journeys
and
even
suggested
meeting
the
young
girl
at
midnight
in
the
barns
of
the
miette
who
was
much
more
practical
shrugged
her
shoulders
declaring
she
would
try
to
think
of
some
spot
on
the
morrow
she
tarried
but
a
minute
at
the
well
just
time
enough
to
smile
at
silvere
and
tell
him
to
be
at
the
far
end
of
the
aire
at
about
ten
o
clock
in
the
evening
one
may
be
sure
that
the
young
man
was
punctual
all
day
long
miette
s
choice
had
puzzled
him
and
his
curiosity
increased
when
he
found
himself
in
the
narrow
lane
formed
by
the
piles
of
planks
at
the
end
of
the
plot
of
ground
she
will
come
this
way
he
said
to
himself
looking
along
the
road
to
nice
but
he
suddenly
heard
a
loud
shaking
of
boughs
behind
the
wall
and
saw
a
laughing
head
with
tumbled
hair
appear
above
the
coping
whilst
a
joyous
voice
called
out
it
s
me
and
it
was
in
fact
miette
who
had
climbed
like
an
urchin
up
one
of
the
which
even
nowadays
still
border
the
boundary
of
the
in
a
couple
of
leaps
she
reached
the
tombstone
half
buried
in
the
corner
at
the
end
of
the
lane
silvere
watched
her
descend
with
delight
and
surprise
without
even
thinking
of
helping
her
as
soon
as
she
had
alighted
however
he
took
both
her
hands
in
his
and
said
how
nimble
you
are
you
climb
better
than
i
it
was
thus
that
they
met
for
the
first
time
in
that
hidden
corner
where
they
were
destined
to
pass
such
happy
hours
from
that
evening
forward
they
saw
each
other
there
nearly
every
night
they
now
only
used
the
well
to
warn
each
other
of
unforeseen
obstacles
to
their
meetings
of
a
change
of
time
and
of
all
the
trifling
little
news
that
seemed
important
in
their
eyes
and
allowed
of
no
delay
it
sufficed
for
the
one
who
had
a
communication
to
make
to
set
the
pulley
in
motion
for
its
creaking
noise
could
be
heard
a
long
way
off
but
although
on
certain
days
they
summoned
one
another
two
or
three
times
in
succession
to
speak
of
trifles
of
immense
importance
it
was
only
in
the
evening
in
that
lonely
little
passage
that
they
tasted
real
happiness
miette
was
exceptionally
punctual
she
fortunately
slept
over
the
kitchen
in
a
room
where
the
winter
provisions
had
been
kept
before
her
arrival
and
which
was
reached
by
a
little
private
staircase
she
was
thus
able
to
go
out
at
all
hours
without
being
seen
by
rebufat
or
justin
moreover
if
the
latter
should
ever
see
her
returning
she
intended
to
tell
him
some
tale
or
other
staring
at
him
the
while
with
that
stern
look
which
always
reduced
him
to
silence
ah
how
happy
those
warm
evenings
were
the
lovers
had
now
reached
the
first
days
of
september
a
month
of
bright
sunshine
in
provence
it
was
hardly
possible
for
them
to
join
each
other
before
nine
o
clock
miette
arrived
from
over
the
wall
in
surmounting
which
she
soon
acquired
such
dexterity
that
she
was
almost
always
on
the
old
tombstone
before
silvere
had
time
to
stretch
out
his
arms
she
would
laugh
at
her
own
strength
and
agility
as
for
a
moment
with
her
hair
in
disorder
she
remained
almost
breathless
tapping
her
skirt
to
make
it
fall
her
sweetheart
laughingly
called
her
an
impudent
urchin
in
reality
he
much
admired
her
pluck
he
watched
her
jump
over
the
wall
with
the
complacency
of
an
older
brother
supervising
the
exercises
of
a
younger
one
indeed
there
was
yet
much
that
was
childlike
in
their
growing
love
on
several
occasions
they
spoke
of
going
on
some
bird
expedition
on
the
banks
of
the
viorne
you
ll
see
how
i
can
climb
said
miette
proudly
when
i
lived
at
chavanoz
i
used
to
go
right
up
to
the
top
of
old
andre
s
have
you
ever
taken
a
magpie
s
nest
it
s
very
difficult
then
a
discussion
arose
as
to
how
one
ought
to
climb
a
poplar
miette
stated
her
opinions
with
all
a
boy
s
confidence
however
silvere
clasping
her
round
the
knees
had
by
this
time
lifted
her
to
the
ground
and
then
they
would
walk
on
side
by
side
their
arms
encircling
each
other
s
waist
though
they
were
but
children
fond
of
frolicsome
play
and
chatter
and
knew
not
even
how
to
speak
of
love
yet
they
already
partook
of
love
s
delight
it
sufficed
them
to
press
each
other
s
hands
ignorant
whither
their
feelings
and
their
hearts
were
drifting
they
did
not
seek
to
hide
the
blissful
thrills
which
the
slightest
touch
awoke
smiling
often
wondering
at
the
delight
they
experienced
they
yielded
unconsciously
to
the
sweetness
of
new
feelings
even
while
talking
like
a
couple
of
schoolboys
of
the
magpies
nests
which
are
so
difficult
to
reach
and
as
they
talked
they
went
down
the
silent
path
between
the
piles
of
planks
and
the
wall
of
the
they
never
went
beyond
the
end
of
that
narrow
blind
alley
but
invariably
retraced
their
steps
they
were
quite
at
home
there
miette
happy
in
the
knowledge
of
their
safe
concealment
would
often
pause
and
congratulate
herself
on
her
discovery
wasn
t
i
lucky
she
would
gleefully
exclaim
we
might
walk
a
long
way
without
finding
such
a
good
the
thick
grass
muffled
the
noise
of
their
footsteps
they
were
steeped
in
gloom
shut
in
between
two
black
walls
and
only
a
strip
of
dark
sky
spangled
with
stars
was
visible
above
their
heads
and
as
they
stepped
along
pacing
this
path
which
resembled
a
dark
stream
flowing
beneath
the
black
sky
they
were
often
thrilled
with
undefinable
emotion
and
lowered
their
voices
although
there
was
nobody
to
hear
them
surrendering
themselves
as
it
were
to
the
silent
waves
of
night
over
which
they
seemed
to
drift
they
recounted
to
one
another
with
lovers
rapture
the
thousand
trifles
of
the
day
at
other
times
on
bright
nights
when
the
moonlight
clearly
outlined
the
wall
and
the
miette
and
silvere
would
romp
about
with
all
the
carelessness
of
children
the
path
stretched
out
alight
with
white
rays
and
retaining
no
suggestion
of
secrecy
and
the
young
people
laughed
and
chased
each
other
like
boys
at
play
at
times
venturing
even
to
climb
upon
the
piles
of
timber
silvere
was
occasionally
obliged
to
frighten
miette
by
telling
her
that
justin
might
be
watching
her
from
over
the
wall
then
quite
out
of
breath
they
would
stroll
side
by
side
and
plan
how
they
might
some
day
go
for
a
scamper
in
the
meadows
to
see
which
of
the
two
would
catch
the
other
their
growing
love
thus
accommodated
itself
to
dark
and
clear
nights
their
hearts
were
ever
on
the
alert
and
a
little
shade
sufficed
to
sweeten
the
pleasure
of
their
embrace
and
soften
their
laughter
this
retreat
so
gay
in
the
moonshine
so
strangely
thrilling
in
the
gloom
seemed
an
inexhaustible
source
of
both
gaiety
and
silent
emotion
they
would
remain
there
until
midnight
while
the
town
dropped
off
to
sleep
and
the
lights
in
the
windows
of
the
faubourg
went
out
one
by
one
they
were
never
disturbed
in
their
solitude
at
that
late
hour
children
were
no
longer
playing
at
behind
the
piles
of
planks
occasionally
when
the
young
couple
heard
sounds
in
the
distance
the
singing
of
some
workmen
as
they
passed
along
the
road
or
conversation
coming
from
the
neighbouring
sidewalks
they
would
cast
stealthy
glances
over
the
aire
the
stretched
out
empty
of
all
save
here
and
there
some
falling
shadows
on
warm
evenings
they
sometimes
caught
glimpses
of
loving
couples
there
and
of
old
men
sitting
on
the
big
beams
by
the
roadside
when
the
evenings
grew
colder
all
that
they
ever
saw
on
the
melancholy
deserted
spot
was
some
gipsy
fire
before
which
perhaps
a
few
black
shadows
passed
to
and
fro
through
the
still
night
air
words
and
sundry
faint
sounds
were
wafted
to
them
the
of
a
townsman
shutting
his
door
the
closing
of
a
the
deep
striking
of
a
clock
all
the
parting
sounds
of
a
provincial
town
retiring
to
rest
and
when
plassans
was
slumbering
they
might
still
hear
the
quarrelling
of
the
gipsies
and
the
crackling
of
their
fires
amidst
which
suddenly
rose
the
guttural
voices
of
girls
singing
in
a
strange
tongue
full
of
rugged
accents
but
the
lovers
did
not
concern
themselves
much
with
what
went
on
in
the
aire
they
hastened
back
into
their
own
little
privacy
and
again
walked
along
their
favourite
retired
path
little
did
they
care
for
others
or
for
the
town
itself
the
few
planks
which
separated
them
from
the
wicked
world
seemed
to
them
after
a
while
an
insurmountable
rampart
they
were
so
secluded
so
free
in
this
nook
situated
though
it
was
in
the
very
midst
of
the
faubourg
at
only
fifty
paces
from
the
rome
gate
that
they
sometimes
fancied
themselves
far
away
in
some
hollow
of
the
viorne
with
the
open
country
around
them
of
all
the
sounds
which
reached
them
only
one
made
them
feel
uneasy
that
of
the
clocks
striking
slowly
in
the
darkness
at
times
when
the
hour
sounded
they
pretended
not
to
hear
at
other
moments
they
stopped
short
as
if
to
protest
however
they
could
not
go
on
for
ever
taking
just
another
ten
minutes
and
so
the
time
came
when
they
were
at
last
obliged
to
say
then
miette
reluctantly
climbed
upon
the
wall
again
but
all
was
not
ended
yet
they
would
linger
over
their
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
when
the
girl
had
climbed
upon
the
wall
she
remained
there
with
her
elbows
on
the
coping
and
her
feet
supported
by
the
branches
of
the
which
served
her
as
a
ladder
silvere
perched
on
the
tombstone
was
able
to
take
her
hands
again
and
renew
their
whispered
conversation
they
repeated
till
a
dozen
times
and
still
and
ever
found
something
more
to
say
at
last
silvere
began
to
scold
come
you
must
get
down
it
is
past
but
miette
with
a
girl
s
waywardness
wished
him
to
descend
first
she
wanted
to
see
him
go
away
and
as
he
persisted
in
remaining
she
ended
by
saying
abruptly
by
way
of
punishment
perhaps
look
i
am
going
to
jump
then
she
sprang
from
the
to
the
great
consternation
of
silvere
he
heard
the
dull
thud
of
her
fall
and
the
burst
of
laughter
with
which
she
ran
off
without
choosing
to
reply
to
his
last
adieu
for
some
minutes
he
would
remain
watching
her
vague
figure
as
it
disappeared
in
the
darkness
then
slowly
descending
he
regained
the
impasse
during
two
years
they
came
to
the
path
every
day
at
the
time
of
their
first
meetings
they
enjoyed
some
beautiful
warm
nights
they
might
almost
have
fancied
themselves
in
the
month
of
may
the
month
of
seething
sap
when
a
pleasant
odour
of
earth
and
fresh
leaves
pervades
the
warm
air
this
this
second
spring
was
like
a
gift
from
heaven
which
allowed
them
to
run
freely
about
the
path
and
tighten
their
bonds
of
affection
at
last
came
rain
and
snow
and
frost
but
the
disagreeableness
of
winter
did
not
keep
them
away
miette
put
on
her
long
brown
pelisse
and
they
both
made
light
of
the
bad
weather
when
the
nights
were
dry
and
clear
and
puffs
of
wind
raised
the
hoar
frost
beneath
their
footsteps
and
fell
on
their
faces
like
taps
from
a
switch
they
refrained
from
sitting
down
they
walked
quickly
to
and
fro
wrapped
in
the
pelisse
their
cheeks
blue
with
cold
and
their
eyes
watering
and
they
laughed
heartily
quite
quivering
with
mirth
at
the
rapidity
of
their
march
through
the
freezing
atmosphere
one
snowy
evening
they
amused
themselves
with
making
an
enormous
snowball
which
they
rolled
into
a
corner
it
remained
there
fully
a
month
which
caused
them
fresh
astonishment
each
time
they
met
in
the
path
nor
did
the
rain
frighten
them
they
came
to
see
each
other
through
the
heaviest
downpours
though
they
got
wet
to
the
skin
in
doing
so
silvere
would
hasten
to
the
spot
saying
to
himself
that
miette
would
never
be
mad
enough
to
come
and
when
miette
arrived
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
scold
her
in
reality
he
had
been
expecting
her
at
last
he
sought
some
shelter
against
the
inclement
weather
knowing
quite
well
that
they
would
certainly
come
out
however
much
they
might
promise
one
another
not
to
do
so
when
it
rained
to
find
a
shelter
he
only
had
to
disturb
one
of
the
pulling
out
several
pieces
of
wood
and
arranging
them
so
that
they
would
move
easily
in
such
wise
that
he
could
displace
and
replace
them
at
pleasure
from
that
time
forward
the
lovers
possessed
a
sort
of
low
and
narrow
a
square
hole
which
was
only
big
enough
to
hold
them
closely
squeezed
together
on
a
beam
which
they
had
left
at
the
bottom
of
the
little
cell
whenever
it
rained
the
first
to
arrive
would
take
shelter
here
and
on
finding
themselves
together
again
they
would
listen
with
delight
to
the
rain
beating
on
the
piles
of
planks
before
and
around
them
through
the
inky
blackness
of
the
night
came
a
rush
of
water
which
they
could
not
see
but
which
resounded
continuously
like
the
roar
of
a
mob
they
were
nevertheless
quite
alone
as
though
they
had
been
at
the
end
of
the
world
or
beneath
the
sea
they
never
felt
so
happy
so
isolated
as
when
they
found
themselves
in
that
in
the
midst
of
some
such
deluge
which
threatened
to
carry
them
away
at
every
moment
their
bent
knees
almost
reached
the
opening
and
though
they
thrust
themselves
back
as
far
as
possible
the
spray
of
the
rain
bathed
their
cheeks
and
hands
the
big
drops
falling
from
the
planks
splashed
at
regular
intervals
at
their
feet
the
brown
pelisse
kept
them
warm
and
the
nook
was
so
small
that
miette
was
compelled
to
sit
almost
on
silvere
s
knees
and
they
would
chatter
and
then
lapse
into
silence
overcome
with
languor
lulled
by
the
warmth
of
their
embrace
and
the
monotonous
beating
of
the
shower
for
hours
and
hours
they
remained
there
with
that
same
enjoyment
of
the
rain
which
prompts
little
children
to
stroll
along
solemnly
in
stormy
weather
with
open
umbrellas
in
their
hands
after
a
while
they
came
to
prefer
the
rainy
evenings
though
their
parting
became
more
painful
on
those
occasions
miette
was
obliged
to
climb
the
wall
in
the
driving
rain
and
cross
the
puddles
of
the
in
perfect
darkness
as
soon
as
she
had
left
his
arms
she
was
lost
to
silvere
amidst
the
gloom
and
the
noise
of
the
falling
water
in
vain
he
listened
he
was
deafened
blinded
however
the
anxiety
caused
by
this
brusque
separation
proved
an
additional
charm
and
until
the
morrow
each
would
be
uneasy
lest
anything
should
have
befallen
the
other
in
such
weather
when
one
would
not
even
have
turned
a
dog
out
of
doors
perchance
one
of
them
had
slipped
or
lost
the
way
such
were
the
mutual
fears
which
possessed
them
and
rendered
their
next
interview
yet
more
loving
at
last
the
fine
days
returned
april
brought
mild
nights
and
the
grass
in
the
green
alley
sprouted
up
wildly
amidst
the
stream
of
life
flowing
from
heaven
and
rising
from
the
earth
amidst
all
the
intoxication
of
the
budding
the
lovers
sometimes
regretted
their
winter
solitude
the
rainy
evenings
and
the
freezing
nights
during
which
they
had
been
so
isolated
so
far
from
all
human
sounds
at
present
the
days
did
not
draw
to
a
close
soon
enough
and
they
grew
impatient
with
the
lagging
twilights
when
the
night
had
fallen
sufficiently
for
miette
to
climb
upon
the
wall
without
danger
of
being
seen
and
they
could
at
last
glide
along
their
dear
path
they
no
longer
found
there
the
solitude
congenial
to
their
shy
childish
love
people
began
to
flock
to
the
aire
the
urchins
of
the
faubourg
remained
there
romping
about
the
beams
and
shouting
till
eleven
o
clock
at
night
it
even
happened
occasionally
that
one
of
them
would
go
and
hide
behind
the
piles
of
timber
and
assail
miette
and
silvere
with
boyish
jeers
the
fear
of
being
surprised
amidst
that
general
awakening
of
life
as
the
season
gradually
grew
warmer
tinged
their
meetings
with
anxiety
then
too
they
began
to
stifle
in
the
narrow
lane
never
had
it
throbbed
with
so
ardent
a
quiver
never
had
that
soil
in
which
the
last
bones
left
of
the
former
cemetery
lay
mouldering
sent
forth
such
oppressive
and
disturbing
odours
they
were
still
too
young
to
relish
the
voluptuous
charm
of
that
secluded
nook
which
the
springtide
filled
with
fever
the
grass
grew
to
their
knees
they
moved
to
and
fro
with
difficulty
and
certain
plants
when
they
crushed
their
young
shoots
sent
forth
a
pungent
odour
which
made
them
dizzy
then
seized
with
strange
drowsiness
and
staggering
with
giddiness
their
feet
as
though
entangled
in
the
grass
they
would
lean
against
the
wall
with
eyes
unable
to
move
a
step
all
the
soft
languor
from
the
skies
seemed
to
penetrate
them
with
the
petulance
of
beginners
impatient
and
irritated
at
this
sudden
faintness
they
began
to
think
their
retreat
too
confined
and
decided
to
ramble
through
the
open
fields
every
evening
came
fresh
frolics
miette
arrived
with
her
pelisse
they
wrapped
themselves
in
it
and
then
gliding
past
the
walls
reached
the
and
the
open
country
the
broad
fields
where
the
wind
rolled
with
full
strength
like
the
waves
at
high
tide
and
here
they
no
longer
felt
stifled
they
recovered
all
their
youthfulness
free
from
the
giddy
intoxication
born
of
the
tall
rank
weeds
of
the
aire
during
two
summers
they
rambled
through
the
district
every
rock
ledge
every
bed
of
turf
soon
knew
them
there
was
not
a
cluster
of
trees
a
hedge
or
a
bush
which
did
not
become
their
friend
they
realized
their
dreams
they
chased
each
other
wildly
over
the
meadows
of
and
miette
ran
so
well
that
silvere
had
to
put
his
best
foot
forward
to
catch
her
sometimes
too
they
went
in
search
of
magpies
nests
headstrong
miette
wishing
to
show
how
she
had
climbed
trees
at
chavanoz
would
tie
up
her
skirts
with
a
piece
of
string
and
ascend
the
highest
poplars
while
silvere
stood
trembling
beneath
with
his
arms
outstretched
to
catch
her
should
she
slip
these
frolics
so
turned
them
from
thoughts
of
love
that
one
evening
they
almost
fought
like
a
couple
of
lads
coming
out
of
school
but
there
were
nooks
in
the
country
side
which
were
not
healthful
for
them
so
long
as
they
rambled
on
they
were
continually
shouting
with
laughter
pushing
and
teasing
one
another
they
covered
miles
and
miles
of
ground
sometimes
they
went
as
far
as
the
chain
of
the
garrigues
following
the
narrowest
paths
and
cutting
across
the
fields
the
region
belonged
to
them
they
lived
there
as
in
a
conquered
territory
enjoying
all
that
the
earth
and
the
sky
could
give
them
miette
with
a
woman
s
lack
of
scruple
did
not
hesitate
to
pluck
a
bunch
of
grapes
or
a
cluster
of
green
almonds
from
the
vines
and
whose
boughs
brushed
her
as
she
passed
and
at
this
silvere
with
his
absolute
ideas
of
honesty
felt
vexed
although
he
did
not
venture
to
find
fault
with
the
girl
whose
occasional
sulking
distressed
him
oh
the
bad
girl
thought
he
childishly
exaggerating
the
matter
she
would
make
a
thief
of
but
miette
would
thereupon
force
his
share
of
the
stolen
fruit
into
his
mouth
the
artifices
he
employed
such
as
holding
her
round
the
waist
avoiding
the
fruit
trees
and
making
her
run
after
him
when
they
were
near
the
vines
so
as
to
keep
her
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
quickly
exhausted
his
imagination
at
last
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
her
sit
down
and
then
they
again
began
to
experience
their
former
stifling
sensations
the
gloomy
valley
of
the
viorne
particularly
disturbed
them
when
weariness
brought
them
to
the
banks
of
the
torrent
all
their
childish
gaiety
seemed
to
disappear
a
grey
shadow
floated
under
the
willows
like
the
scented
crape
of
a
woman
s
dress
the
children
felt
this
crape
descend
warm
and
balmy
from
the
voluptuous
shoulders
of
the
night
kiss
their
temples
and
envelop
them
with
irresistible
languor
in
the
distance
the
crickets
chirped
in
the
meadows
of
and
at
their
feet
the
ripples
of
the
viorne
sounded
like
lovers
whispers
like
the
soft
cooing
of
humid
lips
the
stars
cast
a
rain
of
sparkles
from
the
slumbering
heavens
and
amidst
the
throbbing
of
the
sky
the
waters
and
the
darkness
the
children
reposing
on
the
grass
sought
each
other
s
hands
and
pressed
them
silvere
who
vaguely
understood
the
danger
of
these
ecstasies
would
sometimes
jump
up
and
propose
to
cross
over
to
one
of
the
islets
left
by
the
low
water
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
both
ventured
forth
with
bare
feet
miette
made
light
of
the
pebbles
refusing
silvere
s
help
and
it
once
happened
that
she
sat
down
in
the
very
middle
of
the
stream
however
there
were
only
a
few
inches
of
water
and
she
escaped
with
nothing
worse
than
a
wet
petticoat
then
having
reached
the
island
they
threw
themselves
on
the
long
neck
of
sand
their
eyes
on
a
level
with
the
surface
of
the
river
whose
silvery
scales
they
saw
quivering
far
away
in
the
clear
night
then
miette
would
declare
that
they
were
in
a
boat
that
the
island
was
certainly
floating
she
could
feel
it
carrying
her
along
the
dizziness
caused
by
the
rippling
of
the
water
amused
them
for
a
moment
and
they
lingered
there
singing
in
an
undertone
like
boatmen
as
they
strike
the
water
with
their
oars
at
other
times
when
the
island
had
a
low
bank
they
sat
there
as
on
a
bed
of
verdure
and
let
their
bare
feet
dangle
in
the
stream
and
then
for
hours
they
chatted
together
swinging
their
legs
and
splashing
the
water
delighted
to
set
a
tempest
raging
in
the
peaceful
pool
whose
freshness
cooled
their
fever
these
footbaths
suggested
a
dangerous
idea
to
miette
nothing
would
satisfy
her
but
a
complete
bath
a
little
above
the
bridge
over
the
viorne
there
was
a
very
convenient
spot
she
said
barely
three
or
four
feet
deep
and
quite
safe
the
weather
was
so
warm
it
would
be
so
nice
to
have
the
water
up
to
their
necks
besides
which
she
had
been
dying
to
learn
to
swim
for
such
a
long
time
and
silvere
would
be
able
to
teach
her
silvere
raised
objections
it
was
not
prudent
at
night
time
they
might
be
seen
perhaps
too
they
might
catch
cold
however
nothing
could
turn
miette
from
her
purpose
one
evening
she
came
with
a
bathing
costume
which
she
had
made
out
of
an
old
dress
and
silvere
was
then
obliged
to
go
back
to
aunt
dide
s
for
his
bathing
drawers
their
proceedings
were
characterised
by
great
simplicity
miette
disrobed
herself
beneath
the
shade
of
a
stout
willow
and
when
both
were
ready
enveloped
in
the
blackness
which
fell
from
the
foliage
around
them
they
gaily
entered
the
cool
water
oblivious
of
all
previous
scruples
and
knowing
in
their
innocence
no
sense
of
shame
they
remained
in
the
river
quite
an
hour
splashing
and
throwing
water
into
each
other
s
faces
miette
now
getting
cross
now
breaking
out
into
laughter
while
silvere
gave
her
her
first
lesson
dipping
her
head
under
every
now
and
again
so
as
to
accustom
her
to
the
water
as
long
as
he
held
her
up
she
threw
her
arms
and
legs
about
violently
thinking
she
was
swimming
but
directly
he
let
her
go
she
cried
and
struggled
striking
the
water
with
her
outstretched
hands
clutching
at
anything
she
could
get
hold
of
the
young
man
s
waist
or
one
of
his
wrists
she
leant
against
him
for
an
instant
resting
out
of
breath
and
dripping
with
water
and
then
she
cried
once
more
but
you
do
it
on
purpose
you
don
t
hold
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
the
girl
was
able
to
swim
with
her
limbs
moving
freely
rocked
by
the
stream
playing
with
it
she
yielded
form
and
spirit
alike
to
its
soft
motion
to
the
silence
of
the
heavens
and
the
dreaminess
of
the
melancholy
banks
as
she
and
silvere
swam
noiselessly
along
she
seemed
to
see
the
foliage
of
both
banks
thicken
and
hang
over
them
draping
them
round
as
with
a
huge
curtain
when
the
moon
shone
its
rays
glided
between
the
trunks
of
the
trees
and
phantoms
seemed
to
flit
along
the
in
white
robes
miette
felt
no
nervousness
however
only
an
indefinable
emotion
as
she
followed
the
play
of
the
shadows
as
she
went
onward
with
slower
motion
the
calm
water
which
the
moon
converted
into
a
bright
mirror
rippled
at
her
approach
like
a
cloth
eddies
widened
and
lost
themselves
amid
the
shadows
of
the
banks
under
the
hanging
willow
branches
whence
issued
weird
plashing
sounds
at
every
stroke
she
perceived
recesses
full
of
sound
dark
cavities
which
she
hastened
to
pass
by
clusters
and
rows
of
trees
whose
sombre
masses
were
continually
changing
form
stretching
forward
and
apparently
following
her
from
the
summit
of
the
bank
and
when
she
threw
herself
on
her
back
the
depths
of
the
heavens
affected
her
still
more
from
the
fields
from
the
distant
horizon
which
she
could
no
longer
see
a
solemn
lingering
strain
composed
of
all
the
sighs
of
the
night
was
wafted
to
her
she
was
not
of
a
dreamy
nature
it
was
physically
through
the
medium
of
each
of
her
senses
that
she
derived
enjoyment
from
the
sky
the
river
and
the
play
of
light
and
shadow
the
river
in
particular
bore
her
along
with
endless
caresses
when
she
swam
against
the
current
she
was
delighted
to
feel
the
stream
flow
rapidly
against
her
bosom
and
limbs
she
dipped
herself
in
it
yet
more
deeply
with
the
water
reaching
to
her
lips
so
that
it
might
pass
over
her
shoulders
and
envelop
her
from
chin
to
feet
with
flying
kisses
then
she
would
float
languid
and
quiescent
on
the
surface
whilst
the
ripples
glided
softly
between
her
costume
and
her
skin
and
she
would
also
roll
over
in
the
still
pools
like
a
cat
on
a
carpet
and
swim
from
the
luminous
patches
where
the
moonbeams
were
bathing
to
the
dark
water
shaded
by
the
foliage
shivering
the
while
as
though
she
had
quitted
a
sunny
plain
and
then
felt
the
cold
from
the
boughs
falling
on
her
neck
she
now
remained
quite
silent
in
the
water
and
would
not
allow
silvere
to
touch
her
gliding
softly
by
his
side
she
swam
on
with
the
light
rustling
of
a
bird
flying
across
the
copse
or
else
she
would
circle
round
him
a
prey
to
vague
disquietude
which
she
did
not
comprehend
he
himself
darted
quickly
away
if
he
happened
to
brush
against
her
the
river
was
now
but
a
source
of
enervating
intoxication
voluptuous
languor
which
disturbed
them
strangely
when
they
emerged
from
their
bath
they
felt
dizzy
weary
and
drowsy
fortunately
the
girl
declared
one
evening
that
she
would
bathe
no
more
as
the
cold
water
made
the
blood
run
to
her
head
and
it
was
in
all
truth
and
innocence
that
she
said
this
then
their
long
conversations
began
anew
the
dangers
to
which
the
innocence
of
their
love
had
lately
been
exposed
had
left
no
other
trace
in
silvere
s
mind
than
great
admiration
for
miette
s
physical
strength
she
had
learned
to
swim
in
a
fortnight
and
often
when
they
raced
together
he
had
seen
her
stem
the
current
with
a
stroke
as
rapid
as
his
own
he
who
delighted
in
strength
and
bodily
exercises
felt
a
thrill
of
pleasure
at
seeing
her
so
strong
so
active
and
adroit
he
entertained
at
heart
a
singular
admiration
for
her
stout
arms
one
evening
after
one
of
the
first
baths
that
had
left
them
so
playful
they
caught
each
other
round
the
waist
on
a
strip
of
sand
and
wrestled
for
several
minutes
without
silvere
being
able
to
throw
miette
at
last
indeed
it
was
the
young
man
who
lost
his
balance
while
the
girl
remained
standing
her
sweetheart
treated
her
like
a
boy
and
it
was
those
long
rambles
of
theirs
those
wild
races
across
the
meadows
those
birds
nests
filched
from
the
tree
crests
those
struggles
and
violent
games
of
one
and
another
kind
that
so
long
shielded
them
and
their
love
from
all
impurity
then
too
apart
from
his
youthful
admiration
for
his
sweetheart
s
dashing
pluck
silvere
felt
for
her
all
the
compassionate
tenderness
of
a
heart
that
ever
softened
towards
the
unfortunate
he
who
could
never
see
any
forsaken
creature
a
poor
man
or
a
child
walking
barefooted
along
the
dusty
roads
without
a
throb
of
pity
loved
miette
because
nobody
else
loved
her
because
she
virtually
led
an
outcast
s
hard
life
when
he
saw
her
smile
he
was
deeply
moved
by
the
joy
he
brought
her
moreover
the
child
was
a
wildling
like
himself
and
they
were
of
the
same
mind
in
hating
all
the
gossips
of
the
faubourg
the
dreams
in
which
silvere
indulged
in
the
daytime
while
he
plied
his
heavy
hammer
round
the
cartwheels
in
his
master
s
shop
were
full
of
generous
enthusiasm
he
fancied
himself
miette
s
redeemer
all
his
reading
rushed
to
his
head
he
meant
to
marry
his
sweetheart
some
day
in
order
to
raise
her
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
it
was
like
a
holy
mission
that
he
imposed
upon
himself
that
of
redeeming
and
saving
the
convict
s
daughter
and
his
head
was
so
full
of
certain
theories
and
arguments
that
he
did
not
tell
himself
these
things
in
simple
fashion
but
became
lost
in
perfect
social
mysticism
imagining
rehabilitation
in
the
form
of
an
apotheosis
in
which
he
pictured
miette
seated
on
a
throne
at
the
end
of
the
cours
sauvaire
while
the
whole
town
prostrated
itself
before
her
entreating
her
pardon
and
singing
her
praises
happily
he
forgot
all
these
fine
things
as
soon
as
miette
jumped
over
the
wall
and
said
to
him
on
the
high
road
let
us
have
a
race
i
m
sure
you
won
t
catch
however
if
the
young
man
dreamt
like
this
of
the
glorification
of
his
sweetheart
he
also
showed
such
passion
for
justice
that
he
often
made
her
weep
on
speaking
to
her
about
her
father
in
spite
of
the
softening
effect
which
silvere
s
friendship
had
had
upon
her
she
still
at
times
gave
way
to
angry
outbreaks
of
temper
when
all
the
stubbornness
and
rebellion
latent
in
her
nature
stiffened
her
with
scowling
eyes
and
lips
she
would
then
contend
that
her
father
had
done
quite
right
to
kill
the
gendarme
that
the
earth
belongs
to
everybody
and
that
one
has
the
right
to
fire
a
gun
when
and
where
one
likes
thereupon
silvere
in
a
grave
voice
explained
the
law
to
her
as
he
understood
it
with
strange
commentaries
which
would
have
startled
the
whole
magistracy
of
plassans
these
discussions
took
place
most
often
in
some
remote
corner
of
the
meadows
the
grassy
carpet
of
a
dusky
green
hue
stretched
further
than
they
could
see
undotted
even
by
a
single
tree
and
the
sky
seemed
colossal
spangling
the
bare
horizon
with
the
stars
it
seemed
to
the
young
couple
as
if
they
were
being
rocked
on
a
sea
of
verdure
miette
argued
the
point
obstinately
she
asked
silvere
if
her
father
should
have
let
the
gendarme
kill
him
and
silvere
after
a
momentary
silence
replied
that
in
such
a
case
it
was
better
to
be
the
victim
than
the
murderer
and
that
it
was
a
great
misfortune
for
anyone
to
kill
a
fellow
man
even
in
legitimate
defence
the
law
was
something
holy
to
him
and
the
judges
had
done
right
in
sending
chantegreil
to
the
galleys
at
this
the
girl
grew
angry
and
almost
struck
her
sweetheart
crying
out
that
he
was
as
heartless
as
the
rest
and
as
he
still
firmly
defended
his
ideas
of
justice
she
finished
by
bursting
into
sobs
and
stammering
that
he
was
doubtless
ashamed
of
her
since
he
was
always
reminding
her
of
her
father
s
crime
these
discussions
ended
in
tears
in
mutual
emotion
but
although
the
child
cried
and
acknowledged
that
she
was
perhaps
wrong
she
still
retained
deep
within
her
a
wild
resentful
temper
she
once
related
with
hearty
laughter
that
she
had
seen
a
gendarme
fall
off
his
horse
and
break
his
leg
apart
from
this
miette
only
lived
for
silvere
when
he
asked
her
about
her
uncle
and
cousin
she
replied
that
she
did
not
know
and
if
he
pressed
her
fearing
that
they
were
making
her
too
unhappy
at
the
she
simply
answered
that
she
worked
hard
and
that
nothing
had
changed
she
believed
however
that
justin
had
at
last
found
out
what
made
her
sing
in
the
morning
and
filled
her
eyes
with
delight
but
she
added
what
does
it
matter
if
ever
he
comes
to
disturb
us
we
ll
receive
him
in
such
a
way
that
he
won
t
be
in
a
hurry
to
meddle
with
our
affairs
any
now
and
again
the
open
country
their
long
rambles
in
the
fresh
air
wearied
them
somewhat
they
then
invariably
returned
to
the
aire
to
the
narrow
lane
whence
they
had
been
driven
by
the
noisy
summer
evenings
the
pungent
scent
of
the
trodden
grass
all
the
warm
oppressive
emanations
on
certain
nights
however
the
path
proved
cooler
and
the
winds
freshened
it
so
that
they
could
remain
there
without
feeling
faint
they
then
enjoyed
a
feeling
of
delightful
repose
seated
on
the
tombstone
deaf
to
the
noise
of
the
children
and
gipsies
they
felt
at
home
again
silvere
had
on
various
occasions
picked
up
fragments
of
bones
even
pieces
of
skulls
and
they
were
fond
of
speaking
of
the
ancient
it
seemed
to
them
in
their
lively
fancies
that
their
love
had
shot
up
like
some
vigorous
plant
in
this
nook
of
soil
which
dead
men
s
bones
had
fertilised
it
had
grown
indeed
like
those
wild
weeds
it
had
blossomed
as
blossom
the
poppies
which
sway
like
bare
bleeding
hearts
at
the
slightest
breeze
and
they
ended
by
fancying
that
the
warm
breaths
passing
over
them
the
whisperings
heard
in
the
gloom
the
long
quivering
which
thrilled
the
path
came
from
the
dead
folk
sighing
their
departed
passions
in
their
faces
telling
them
the
stories
of
their
bridals
as
they
turned
restlessly
in
their
graves
full
of
a
fierce
longing
to
live
and
love
again
those
fragments
of
bone
they
felt
convinced
of
it
were
full
of
affection
for
them
the
shattered
skulls
grew
warm
again
by
contact
with
their
own
youthful
fire
the
smallest
particles
surrounded
them
with
passionate
whispering
anxious
solicitude
throbbing
jealousy
and
when
they
departed
the
old
seemed
to
groan
those
weeds
in
which
their
entangled
feet
often
stumbled
on
sultry
nights
were
fingers
tapered
by
tomb
life
that
sprang
up
from
the
earth
to
detain
them
and
cast
them
into
each
other
s
arms
that
pungent
and
penetrating
odour
exhaled
by
the
broken
stems
was
the
fertilising
perfume
the
mighty
quintessence
of
life
which
is
slowly
elaborated
in
the
grave
and
intoxicates
the
lovers
who
wander
in
the
solitude
of
the
paths
the
dead
the
old
departed
dead
longed
for
the
bridal
of
miette
and
silvere
they
were
never
afraid
the
sympathy
which
seemed
to
hover
around
them
thrilled
them
and
made
them
love
the
invisible
beings
whose
soft
touch
they
often
imagined
they
could
feel
like
a
gentle
flapping
of
wings
sometimes
they
were
saddened
by
sweet
melancholy
and
could
not
understand
what
the
dead
desired
of
them
they
went
on
basking
in
their
innocent
love
amidst
this
flood
of
sap
this
abandoned
cemetery
whose
rich
soil
teemed
with
life
and
imperiously
demanded
their
union
they
still
remained
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
the
buzzing
voices
which
they
heard
ringing
in
their
ears
the
sudden
glow
which
sent
the
blood
flying
to
their
faces
they
often
questioned
each
other
about
the
remains
which
they
discovered
miette
after
a
woman
s
fashion
was
partial
to
lugubrious
subjects
at
each
new
discovery
she
launched
into
endless
suppositions
if
the
bone
were
small
she
spoke
of
some
beautiful
girl
a
prey
to
consumption
or
carried
off
by
fever
on
the
eve
of
her
marriage
if
the
bone
were
large
she
pictured
some
big
old
man
a
soldier
or
a
judge
some
one
who
had
inspired
others
with
terror
for
a
long
time
the
tombstone
particularly
engaged
their
attention
one
fine
moonlight
night
miette
distinguished
some
letters
on
one
side
of
it
and
thereupon
she
made
silvere
scrape
the
moss
away
with
his
knife
then
they
read
the
mutilated
inscription
here
lieth
marie
died
and
miette
finding
her
own
name
on
the
stone
was
quite
silvere
called
her
a
big
baby
but
she
could
not
restrain
her
tears
she
had
received
a
stab
in
the
heart
she
said
she
would
soon
die
and
that
stone
was
meant
for
her
the
young
man
himself
felt
alarmed
however
he
succeeded
in
shaming
the
child
out
of
these
thoughts
what
she
so
courageous
to
dream
about
such
trifles
they
ended
by
laughing
then
they
avoided
speaking
of
it
again
but
in
melancholy
moments
when
the
cloudy
sky
saddened
the
pathway
miette
could
not
help
thinking
of
that
dead
one
that
unknown
marie
whose
tomb
had
so
long
facilitated
their
meetings
the
poor
girl
s
bones
were
perhaps
still
lying
there
and
at
this
thought
miette
one
evening
had
a
strange
whim
and
asked
silvere
to
turn
the
stone
over
to
see
what
might
be
under
it
he
refused
as
though
it
were
sacrilege
and
his
refusal
strengthened
miette
s
fancies
with
regard
to
the
dear
phantom
which
bore
her
name
she
positively
insisted
that
the
girl
had
died
young
as
she
was
and
in
the
very
midst
of
her
love
she
even
began
to
pity
the
stone
that
stone
which
she
climbed
so
nimbly
and
on
which
they
had
sat
so
often
a
stone
which
death
had
chilled
and
which
their
love
had
warmed
again
you
ll
see
this
tombstone
will
bring
us
misfortune
she
added
if
you
were
to
die
i
should
come
and
lie
here
and
then
i
should
like
to
have
this
stone
set
over
my
at
this
silvere
choking
with
emotion
scolded
her
for
thinking
of
such
mournful
things
and
so
for
nearly
two
years
their
love
grew
alike
in
the
narrow
pathway
and
the
open
country
their
idyll
passed
through
the
chilling
rains
of
december
and
the
burning
solicitations
of
july
free
from
all
touch
of
impurity
ever
retaining
the
sweet
charm
of
some
old
greek
all
the
naive
hesitancy
of
youth
which
desires
but
knows
not
in
vain
did
the
dead
whisper
in
their
ears
they
carried
nothing
away
from
the
old
cemetery
but
emotional
melancholy
and
a
vague
presentiment
of
a
short
life
a
voice
seemed
to
whisper
to
them
that
they
would
depart
amidst
their
virginal
love
long
ere
the
bridal
day
would
give
them
wholly
to
each
other
it
was
there
on
the
tombstone
and
among
the
bones
that
lay
hidden
beneath
the
rank
grass
that
they
had
first
come
to
indulge
in
that
longing
for
death
that
eager
desire
to
sleep
together
in
the
earth
that
now
set
them
stammering
and
sighing
beside
the
orcheres
road
on
that
december
night
while
the
two
bells
repeated
their
mournful
warnings
to
one
another
miette
was
sleeping
calmly
with
her
head
resting
on
silvere
s
chest
while
he
mused
upon
their
past
meeting
their
lovely
years
of
unbroken
happiness
at
daybreak
the
girl
awoke
the
valley
now
spread
out
clearly
under
the
bright
sky
the
sun
was
still
behind
the
hills
but
a
stream
of
crystal
light
limpid
and
cold
as
flowed
from
the
pale
horizon
in
the
distance
the
viorne
like
a
white
satin
ribbon
disappeared
among
an
expanse
of
red
and
yellow
land
it
was
a
boundless
vista
with
grey
seas
of
and
vineyards
that
looked
like
huge
pieces
of
striped
cloth
the
whole
country
was
magnified
by
the
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
and
the
peaceful
cold
however
sharp
gusts
of
wind
chilled
the
young
people
s
faces
and
thereupon
they
sprang
to
their
feet
cheered
by
the
sight
of
the
clear
morning
their
melancholy
forebodings
had
vanished
with
the
darkness
and
they
gazed
with
delight
at
the
immense
expanse
of
the
plain
and
listened
to
the
tolling
of
the
two
bells
that
now
seemed
to
be
joyfully
ringing
in
a
holiday
ah
i
ve
had
a
good
sleep
miette
cried
i
dreamt
you
were
kissing
me
tell
me
now
did
you
kiss
me
it
s
very
possible
silvere
replied
laughing
i
was
not
very
warm
it
is
bitterly
i
only
feel
cold
in
the
feet
miette
rejoined
well
let
us
have
a
run
said
silvere
we
have
still
two
good
leagues
to
go
you
will
get
thereupon
they
descended
the
hill
and
ran
until
they
reached
the
high
road
when
they
were
below
they
raised
their
heads
as
if
to
say
farewell
to
that
rock
on
which
they
had
wept
while
their
kisses
burned
their
lips
but
they
did
not
again
speak
of
that
ardent
embrace
which
had
thrilled
them
so
strongly
with
vague
unknown
desire
under
the
pretext
of
walking
more
quickly
they
did
not
even
take
each
other
s
arm
they
experienced
some
slight
confusion
when
they
looked
at
one
another
though
why
they
could
not
tell
meantime
the
dawn
was
rising
around
them
the
young
man
who
had
sometimes
been
sent
to
orcheres
by
his
master
knew
all
the
shortest
cuts
thus
they
walked
on
for
more
than
two
leagues
along
dingle
paths
by
the
side
of
interminable
ledges
and
walls
now
and
again
miette
accused
silvere
of
having
taken
her
the
wrong
way
for
at
times
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
stretch
they
lost
all
sight
of
the
surrounding
country
seeing
above
the
walls
and
hedges
nothing
but
long
rows
of
whose
slender
branches
showed
sharply
against
the
pale
sky
all
at
once
however
they
came
out
just
in
front
of
orcheres
loud
cries
of
joy
the
shouting
of
a
crowd
sounded
clearly
in
the
limpid
air
the
insurrectionary
forces
were
only
now
entering
the
town
miette
and
silvere
went
in
with
the
stragglers
never
had
they
seen
such
enthusiasm
to
judge
from
the
streets
one
would
have
thought
it
was
a
procession
day
when
the
windows
are
decked
with
the
finest
drapery
to
honour
the
passage
of
the
canopy
the
townsfolk
welcomed
the
insurgents
as
though
they
were
deliverers
the
men
embraced
them
while
the
women
brought
them
food
old
men
were
to
be
seen
weeping
at
the
doors
and
the
joyousness
was
of
an
essentially
southern
character
pouring
forth
in
clamorous
fashion
in
singing
dancing
and
gesticulation
as
miette
passed
along
she
was
carried
away
by
a
which
spread
whirling
all
round
the
grand
place
silvere
followed
her
his
thoughts
of
death
and
his
discouragement
were
now
far
away
he
wanted
to
fight
to
sell
his
life
dearly
at
least
the
idea
of
a
struggle
intoxicated
him
afresh
he
dreamed
of
victory
to
be
followed
by
a
happy
life
with
miette
amidst
the
peacefulness
of
the
universal
republic
the
is
the
popular
dance
of
provence
the
fraternal
reception
accorded
them
by
the
inhabitants
of
orcheres
proved
to
be
the
insurgents
last
delight
they
spent
the
day
amidst
radiant
confidence
and
boundless
hope
the
prisoners
commander
sicardot
messieurs
garconnet
peirotte
and
the
others
who
had
been
shut
up
in
one
of
the
rooms
at
the
mayor
s
the
windows
of
which
overlooked
the
grand
place
watched
the
and
wild
outbursts
of
enthusiasm
with
surprise
and
dismay
the
villains
muttered
the
commander
leaning
upon
a
as
though
bending
over
the
of
a
box
at
a
theatre
to
think
that
there
isn
t
a
battery
or
two
to
make
a
clean
sweep
of
all
that
rabble
then
he
perceived
miette
and
addressing
himself
to
monsieur
garconnet
he
added
do
you
see
sir
that
big
girl
in
red
over
yonder
how
disgraceful
they
ve
even
brought
their
mistresses
with
them
if
this
continues
much
longer
we
shall
see
some
fine
monsieur
garconnet
shook
his
head
saying
something
about
unbridled
passions
and
the
most
evil
days
of
monsieur
peirotte
as
white
as
a
sheet
remained
silent
he
only
opened
his
lips
once
to
say
to
sicardot
who
was
still
bitterly
railing
not
so
loud
sir
not
so
loud
you
will
get
us
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
insurgents
treated
the
gentlemen
with
the
greatest
kindness
they
even
provided
them
with
an
excellent
dinner
in
the
evening
such
attentions
however
were
terrifying
to
such
a
quaker
as
the
receiver
of
taxes
the
insurgents
he
thought
would
not
treat
them
so
well
unless
they
wished
to
make
them
fat
and
tender
for
the
day
when
they
might
wish
to
devour
them
at
dusk
that
day
silvere
came
face
to
face
with
his
cousin
doctor
pascal
the
latter
had
followed
the
band
on
foot
chatting
with
the
workmen
who
held
him
in
the
greatest
respect
at
first
he
had
striven
to
dissuade
them
from
the
struggle
and
then
as
if
convinced
by
their
arguments
he
had
said
to
them
with
his
kindly
smile
well
perhaps
you
are
right
my
friends
fight
if
you
like
i
shall
be
here
to
patch
up
your
arms
and
then
in
the
morning
he
began
to
gather
pebbles
and
plants
along
the
high
road
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
brought
his
geologist
s
hammer
and
botanical
wallet
with
him
his
pockets
were
now
so
full
of
stones
that
they
were
almost
bursting
while
bundles
of
long
herbs
peered
forth
from
the
surgeon
s
case
which
he
carried
under
his
arm
hallo
you
here
my
lad
he
cried
as
he
perceived
silvere
i
thought
i
was
the
only
member
of
the
family
he
spoke
these
last
words
with
a
touch
of
irony
as
if
deriding
the
intrigues
of
his
father
and
his
uncle
antoine
silvere
was
very
glad
to
meet
his
cousin
the
doctor
was
the
only
one
of
the
rougons
who
ever
shook
hands
with
him
in
the
street
and
showed
him
any
sincere
friendship
seeing
him
therefore
still
covered
with
dust
from
the
march
the
young
man
thought
him
gained
over
to
the
republican
cause
and
was
much
delighted
thereat
he
talked
to
the
doctor
with
youthful
magniloquence
of
the
people
s
rights
their
holy
cause
and
their
certain
triumph
pascal
smiled
as
he
listened
and
watched
the
youth
s
gestures
and
the
ardent
play
of
his
features
with
curiosity
as
though
he
were
studying
a
patient
or
analysing
an
enthusiasm
to
ascertain
what
might
be
at
the
bottom
of
it
how
you
run
on
how
you
run
on
he
finally
exclaimed
ah
you
are
your
grandmother
s
true
and
in
a
whisper
he
added
like
some
chemist
taking
notes
hysteria
or
enthusiasm
shameful
madness
or
sublime
madness
it
s
always
those
terrible
nerves
then
again
speaking
aloud
as
if
summing
up
the
matter
he
said
the
family
is
complete
now
it
will
count
a
hero
among
its
silvere
did
not
hear
him
he
was
still
talking
of
his
dear
republic
miette
had
dropped
a
few
paces
off
she
was
still
wrapped
in
her
large
red
pelisse
she
and
silvere
had
traversed
the
town
the
sight
of
this
tall
red
girl
at
last
puzzled
pascal
and
again
interrupting
his
cousin
he
asked
him
who
is
this
child
with
you
she
is
my
wife
silvere
gravely
answered
the
doctor
opened
his
eyes
wide
for
he
did
not
understand
he
was
very
shy
with
women
however
he
raised
his
hat
to
miette
as
he
went
away
the
night
proved
an
anxious
one
forebodings
of
misfortune
swept
over
the
insurgents
the
enthusiasm
and
confidence
of
the
previous
evening
seemed
to
die
away
in
the
darkness
in
the
morning
there
were
gloomy
faces
sad
looks
were
exchanged
followed
by
discouraging
silence
terrifying
rumours
were
now
circulating
bad
news
which
the
leaders
had
managed
to
conceal
the
previous
evening
had
spread
abroad
though
nobody
in
particular
was
known
to
have
spoken
it
was
the
work
of
that
invisible
voice
which
with
a
word
throws
a
mob
into
a
panic
according
to
some
reports
paris
was
subdued
and
the
provinces
had
offered
their
hands
and
feet
eager
to
be
bound
and
it
was
added
that
a
large
party
of
troops
which
had
left
marseilles
under
the
command
of
colonel
masson
and
monsieur
de
bleriot
the
prefect
of
the
department
was
advancing
by
forced
marches
to
disperse
the
insurrectionary
bands
this
news
came
like
a
thunderbolt
at
once
awakening
rage
and
despair
these
men
who
on
the
previous
evening
had
been
all
aglow
with
patriotic
fever
now
shivered
with
cold
chilled
to
their
hearts
by
the
shameful
submissiveness
of
prostrate
france
they
alone
then
had
had
the
courage
to
do
their
duty
and
now
they
were
to
be
left
to
perish
amidst
the
general
panic
the
silence
of
the
country
they
had
become
mere
rebels
who
would
be
hunted
down
like
wild
beasts
they
who
had
dreamed
of
a
great
war
of
a
whole
nation
in
revolt
and
of
the
glorious
conquest
of
the
people
s
rights
miserably
baffled
and
betrayed
this
handful
of
men
could
but
weep
for
their
dead
faith
and
their
vanished
dreams
of
justice
there
were
some
who
while
taunting
france
with
her
cowardice
flung
away
their
arms
and
sat
down
by
the
roadside
declaring
that
they
would
there
await
the
bullets
of
the
troops
and
show
how
republicans
could
die
although
these
men
had
nothing
now
but
death
or
exile
before
them
there
were
very
few
desertions
from
their
ranks
a
splendid
feeling
of
solidarity
kept
them
together
their
indignation
turned
chiefly
against
their
leaders
who
had
really
proved
incapable
irreparable
mistakes
had
been
committed
and
now
the
insurgents
without
order
or
discipline
barely
protected
by
a
few
sentries
and
under
the
command
of
irresolute
men
found
themselves
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
soldiers
that
might
arrive
they
spent
two
more
days
at
orcheres
tuesday
and
wednesday
thus
losing
time
and
aggravating
the
situation
the
general
the
man
with
the
sabre
whom
silvere
had
pointed
out
to
miette
on
the
plassans
road
vacillated
and
hesitated
under
the
terrible
responsibility
that
weighed
upon
him
on
thursday
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
position
of
orcheres
was
a
decidedly
dangerous
one
so
towards
one
o
clock
he
gave
orders
to
march
and
led
his
little
army
to
the
heights
of
that
was
indeed
an
impregnable
position
for
any
one
who
knew
how
to
defend
it
the
houses
of
rise
in
tiers
along
a
behind
the
town
all
approach
is
shut
off
by
enormous
rocks
so
that
this
kind
of
citadel
can
only
be
reached
by
the
nores
plain
which
spreads
out
at
the
foot
of
the
plateau
an
esplanade
converted
into
a
public
walk
planted
with
magnificent
elms
overlooks
the
plain
it
was
on
this
esplanade
that
the
insurgents
encamped
the
hostages
were
imprisoned
in
the
hotel
de
la
standing
along
the
promenade
the
night
passed
away
heavy
and
black
the
insurgents
spoke
of
treachery
as
soon
as
it
was
morning
however
the
man
with
the
sabre
who
had
neglected
to
take
the
simplest
precautions
reviewed
the
troops
the
contingents
were
drawn
up
in
line
with
their
backs
turned
to
the
plain
they
presented
a
wonderful
medley
of
costume
some
wearing
brown
jackets
others
dark
greatcoats
and
others
again
blue
blouses
girded
with
red
sashes
moreover
their
arms
were
an
equally
odd
collection
there
were
newly
sharpened
scythes
large
navvies
spades
and
with
burnished
barrels
glittering
in
the
sunshine
and
at
the
very
moment
when
the
improvised
general
was
riding
past
the
little
army
a
sentry
who
had
been
forgotten
in
an
ran
up
gesticulating
and
shouting
the
soldiers
the
soldiers
there
was
indescribable
emotion
at
first
they
thought
it
a
false
alarm
forgetting
all
discipline
they
rushed
forward
to
the
end
of
the
esplanade
in
order
to
see
the
soldiers
the
ranks
were
broken
and
as
the
dark
line
of
troops
appeared
marching
in
perfect
order
with
a
long
glitter
of
bayonets
on
the
other
side
of
the
greyish
curtain
of
olive
trees
there
came
a
hasty
and
disorderly
retreat
which
sent
a
quiver
of
panic
to
the
other
end
of
the
plateau
nevertheless
the
contingents
of
la
palud
and
had
again
formed
in
line
in
the
middle
of
the
promenade
and
stood
there
erect
and
fierce
a
who
was
a
head
taller
than
any
of
his
companions
shouted
as
he
waved
his
red
neckerchief
to
arms
chavanoz
graille
poujols
to
arms
les
tulettes
to
arms
plassans
crowds
streamed
across
the
esplanade
the
man
with
the
sabre
surrounded
by
the
folks
from
faverolles
marched
off
with
several
of
the
country
contingents
vernoux
corbiere
marsanne
and
pruinas
to
outflank
the
enemy
and
then
attack
him
other
contingents
from
valqueyras
nazere
les
and
murdaran
dashed
to
the
left
scattering
themselves
in
skirmishing
parties
over
the
nores
plain
and
meantime
the
men
of
the
towns
and
villages
that
the
had
called
to
his
aid
mustered
together
under
the
elms
there
forming
a
dark
irregular
mass
grouped
without
regard
to
any
of
the
rules
of
strategy
simply
placed
there
like
a
rock
as
it
were
to
bar
the
way
or
die
the
men
of
plassans
stood
in
the
middle
of
this
heroic
battalion
amid
the
grey
hues
of
the
blouses
and
jackets
and
the
bluish
glitter
of
the
weapons
the
pelisse
worn
by
miette
who
was
holding
the
banner
with
both
hands
looked
like
a
large
red
splotch
a
fresh
and
bleeding
wound
all
at
once
perfect
silence
fell
monsieur
peirotte
s
pale
face
appeared
at
a
window
of
the
hotel
de
la
and
he
began
to
speak
gesticulating
with
his
hands
go
in
close
the
shutters
the
insurgents
furiously
shouted
you
ll
get
yourself
thereupon
the
shutters
were
quickly
closed
and
nothing
was
heard
save
the
regular
rhythmical
tramp
of
the
soldiers
who
were
drawing
near
a
minute
that
seemed
an
age
went
by
the
troops
had
disappeared
hidden
by
an
undulation
of
the
ground
but
over
yonder
on
the
side
of
the
nores
plain
the
insurgents
soon
perceived
the
bayonets
shooting
up
one
after
another
like
a
field
of
corn
under
the
rising
sun
at
that
moment
silvere
who
was
glowing
with
feverish
agitation
fancied
he
could
see
the
gendarme
whose
blood
had
stained
his
hands
he
knew
from
the
accounts
of
his
companions
that
rengade
was
not
dead
that
he
had
only
lost
an
eye
and
he
clearly
distinguished
the
unlucky
man
with
his
empty
socket
bleeding
horribly
the
keen
recollection
of
this
gendarme
to
whom
he
had
not
given
a
thought
since
his
departure
from
plassans
proved
unbearable
he
was
afraid
that
fear
might
get
the
better
of
him
and
he
tightened
his
hold
on
his
carbine
while
a
mist
gathered
before
his
eyes
he
felt
a
longing
to
discharge
his
gun
and
fire
at
the
phantom
of
that
man
so
as
to
drive
it
away
meantime
the
bayonets
were
still
and
ever
slowly
ascending
when
the
heads
of
the
soldiers
appeared
on
a
level
with
the
esplanade
silvere
instinctively
turned
to
miette
she
stood
there
with
flushed
face
looking
taller
than
ever
amidst
the
folds
of
the
red
banner
she
was
indeed
standing
on
tiptoes
in
order
to
see
the
troops
and
nervous
expectation
made
her
nostrils
quiver
and
her
red
lips
part
so
as
to
show
her
white
eager
gleaming
teeth
silvere
smiled
at
her
but
he
had
scarcely
turned
his
head
when
a
fusillade
burst
out
the
soldiers
who
could
only
be
seen
from
their
shoulders
upwards
had
just
fired
their
first
volley
it
seemed
to
silvere
as
though
a
great
gust
of
wind
was
passing
over
his
head
while
a
shower
of
leaves
lopped
off
by
the
bullets
fell
from
the
elms
a
sharp
sound
like
the
snapping
of
a
dead
branch
made
him
look
to
his
right
then
prone
on
the
ground
he
saw
the
big
he
who
was
a
head
taller
than
the
others
there
was
a
little
black
hole
in
the
middle
of
his
forehead
and
thereupon
silvere
fired
straight
before
him
without
taking
aim
reloaded
and
fired
again
like
a
madman
or
an
unthinking
wild
beast
in
haste
only
to
kill
he
could
not
even
distinguish
the
soldiers
now
smoke
resembling
strips
of
grey
muslin
was
floating
under
the
elms
the
leaves
still
rained
upon
the
insurgents
for
the
troops
were
firing
too
high
every
now
and
then
athwart
the
fierce
crackling
of
the
fusillade
the
young
man
heard
a
sigh
or
a
low
rattle
and
a
rush
was
made
among
the
band
as
if
to
make
room
for
some
poor
wretch
clutching
hold
of
his
neighbours
as
he
fell
the
firing
lasted
ten
minutes
then
between
two
volleys
some
one
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
terror
every
man
for
himself
qui
peut
this
roused
shouts
and
murmurs
of
rage
as
if
to
say
the
cowards
oh
the
cowards
sinister
rumours
were
spreading
the
general
had
fled
cavalry
were
sabring
the
skirmishers
in
the
nores
plain
however
the
irregular
firing
did
not
cease
every
now
and
again
sudden
bursts
of
flame
sped
through
the
clouds
of
smoke
a
gruff
voice
the
voice
of
terror
shouted
yet
louder
every
man
for
himself
qui
peut
some
men
took
to
flight
throwing
down
their
weapons
and
leaping
over
the
dead
the
others
closed
their
ranks
at
last
there
were
only
some
ten
insurgents
left
two
more
took
to
flight
and
of
the
remaining
eight
three
were
killed
at
one
discharge
the
two
children
had
remained
there
mechanically
without
understanding
anything
as
the
battalion
diminished
in
numbers
miette
raised
the
banner
still
higher
in
the
air
she
held
it
in
front
of
her
with
clenched
fists
as
if
it
were
a
huge
taper
it
was
completely
riddled
by
bullets
when
silvere
had
no
more
cartridges
left
in
his
pocket
he
ceased
firing
and
gazed
at
the
carbine
with
an
air
of
stupor
it
was
then
that
a
shadow
passed
over
his
face
as
though
the
flapping
wings
of
some
colossal
bird
had
brushed
against
his
forehead
and
raising
his
eyes
he
saw
the
banner
fall
from
miette
s
grasp
the
child
her
hands
clasped
to
her
breast
her
head
thrown
back
with
an
expression
of
excruciating
suffering
was
staggering
to
the
ground
she
did
not
utter
a
single
cry
but
sank
at
last
upon
the
red
banner
get
up
come
quickly
silvere
said
in
despair
as
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
but
she
lay
upon
the
ground
without
uttering
a
word
her
eyes
wide
open
then
he
understood
and
fell
on
his
knees
beside
her
you
are
wounded
eh
tell
me
where
are
you
wounded
she
still
spoke
no
word
she
was
stifling
and
gazing
at
him
out
of
her
large
eyes
while
short
quivers
shook
her
frame
then
he
pulled
away
her
hands
it
s
there
isn
t
it
it
s
and
he
tore
open
her
bodice
and
laid
her
bosom
bare
he
searched
but
saw
nothing
his
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
at
last
under
the
left
breast
he
perceived
a
small
pink
hole
a
single
drop
of
blood
stained
the
wound
it
s
nothing
he
whispered
i
ll
go
and
find
pascal
he
ll
put
you
all
right
again
if
you
could
only
get
up
can
t
you
move
the
soldiers
were
not
firing
now
they
had
dashed
to
the
left
in
pursuit
of
the
contingents
led
away
by
the
man
with
the
sabre
and
in
the
centre
of
the
esplanade
there
only
remained
silvere
kneeling
beside
miette
s
body
with
the
stubbornness
of
despair
he
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
he
wanted
to
set
her
on
her
feet
but
such
a
quiver
of
pain
came
upon
the
girl
that
he
laid
her
down
again
and
said
to
her
entreatingly
speak
to
me
pray
why
don
t
you
say
something
to
me
she
could
not
she
slowly
gently
shook
her
hand
as
if
to
say
that
it
was
not
her
fault
her
lips
were
already
contracting
beneath
the
touch
of
death
with
her
unbound
hair
streaming
around
her
and
her
head
resting
amid
the
folds
of
the
banner
all
her
life
now
centred
in
her
eyes
those
black
eyes
glittering
in
her
white
face
silvere
sobbed
the
glance
of
those
big
sorrowful
eyes
filled
him
with
distress
he
read
in
them
bitter
immense
regret
for
life
miette
was
telling
him
that
she
was
going
away
all
alone
and
before
their
bridal
day
that
she
was
leaving
him
ere
she
had
become
his
wife
she
was
telling
him
too
that
it
was
he
who
had
willed
that
it
should
be
so
that
he
should
have
loved
her
as
other
lovers
love
their
sweethearts
in
the
hour
of
her
agony
amidst
that
stern
conflict
between
death
and
her
vigorous
nature
she
bewailed
her
fate
in
going
like
that
to
the
grave
silvere
as
he
bent
over
her
understood
how
bitter
was
the
pang
he
recalled
their
caresses
how
she
had
hung
round
his
neck
and
had
yearned
for
his
love
but
he
had
not
understood
and
now
she
was
departing
from
him
for
evermore
bitterly
grieved
at
the
thought
that
throughout
her
eternal
rest
she
would
remember
him
solely
as
a
companion
and
playfellow
he
kissed
her
on
the
bosom
while
his
hot
tears
fell
upon
her
lips
those
passionate
kisses
brought
a
last
gleam
of
joy
to
miette
s
eyes
they
loved
one
another
and
their
idyll
ended
in
death
but
silvere
could
not
believe
she
was
dying
no
you
will
see
it
will
prove
only
a
trifle
he
declared
don
t
speak
if
it
hurts
you
wait
i
will
raise
your
head
and
then
warm
you
your
hands
are
quite
but
the
fusillade
had
begun
afresh
this
time
on
the
left
in
the
olive
plantations
a
dull
sound
of
galloping
cavalry
rose
from
the
plain
at
times
there
were
loud
cries
as
of
men
being
slaughtered
and
thick
clouds
of
smoke
were
wafted
along
and
hung
about
the
elms
on
the
esplanade
silvere
for
his
part
no
longer
heard
or
saw
anything
pascal
who
came
running
down
in
the
direction
of
the
plain
saw
him
stretched
upon
the
ground
and
hastened
towards
him
thinking
he
was
wounded
as
soon
as
the
young
man
saw
him
he
clutched
hold
of
him
and
pointed
to
miette
look
he
said
she
s
wounded
there
under
the
breast
ah
how
good
of
you
to
come
you
will
save
at
that
moment
however
a
slight
convulsion
shook
the
dying
girl
a
shadow
passed
over
her
face
and
as
her
contracted
lips
suddenly
parted
a
faint
sigh
escaped
from
them
her
eyes
still
wide
open
gazed
fixedly
at
the
young
man
then
pascal
who
had
stooped
down
rose
again
saying
in
a
low
voice
she
is
dead
silvere
reeled
at
the
sound
of
the
word
he
had
been
kneeling
forward
but
now
he
sank
back
as
though
thrown
down
by
miette
s
last
faint
sigh
dead
dead
he
repeated
it
is
not
true
she
is
looking
at
me
see
how
she
is
looking
at
me
then
he
caught
the
doctor
by
the
coat
entreating
him
to
remain
there
assuring
him
that
he
was
mistaken
that
she
was
not
dead
and
that
he
could
save
her
if
he
only
would
pascal
resisted
gently
saying
in
his
kindly
voice
i
can
do
nothing
for
her
others
are
waiting
for
me
let
go
my
poor
child
she
is
quite
at
last
silvere
released
his
hold
and
again
fell
back
dead
dead
still
that
word
which
rang
like
a
knell
in
his
dazed
brain
when
he
was
alone
he
crept
up
close
to
the
corpse
miette
still
seemed
to
be
looking
at
him
he
threw
himself
upon
her
laid
his
head
upon
her
bosom
and
watered
it
with
his
tears
he
was
beside
himself
with
grief
he
pressed
his
lips
wildly
to
her
and
breathed
out
all
his
passion
all
his
soul
in
one
long
kiss
as
though
in
the
hope
that
it
might
bring
her
to
life
again
but
the
girl
was
turning
cold
in
spite
of
his
caresses
he
felt
her
lifeless
and
nerveless
beneath
his
touch
then
he
was
seized
with
terror
and
with
haggard
face
and
listless
hanging
arms
he
remained
crouching
in
a
state
of
stupor
and
repeating
she
is
dead
yet
she
is
looking
at
me
she
does
not
close
her
eyes
she
sees
me
this
fancy
was
very
sweet
to
him
he
remained
there
perfectly
still
exchanging
a
long
look
with
miette
in
whose
glance
deepened
by
death
he
still
seemed
to
read
the
girl
s
lament
for
her
sad
fate
in
the
meantime
the
cavalry
were
still
sabring
the
fugitives
over
the
nores
plain
the
cries
of
the
wounded
and
the
galloping
of
the
horses
became
more
distant
softening
like
music
wafted
from
afar
through
the
clear
air
silvere
was
no
longer
conscious
of
the
fighting
he
did
not
even
see
his
cousin
who
mounted
the
slope
again
and
crossed
the
promenade
pascal
as
he
passed
along
picked
up
macquart
s
carbine
which
silvere
had
thrown
down
he
knew
it
as
he
had
seen
it
hanging
over
aunt
dide
s
and
he
thought
he
might
as
well
save
it
from
the
hands
of
the
victors
he
had
scarcely
entered
the
hotel
de
la
whither
a
large
number
of
the
wounded
had
been
taken
when
a
band
of
insurgents
chased
by
the
soldiers
like
a
herd
of
cattle
once
more
rushed
into
the
esplanade
the
man
with
the
sabre
had
fled
it
was
the
last
contingents
from
the
country
who
were
being
exterminated
there
was
a
terrible
massacre
in
vain
did
colonel
masson
and
the
prefect
monsieur
de
bleriot
overcome
by
pity
order
a
retreat
the
infuriated
soldiers
continued
firing
upon
the
mass
and
pinning
isolated
fugitives
to
the
walls
with
their
bayonets
when
they
had
no
more
enemies
before
them
they
riddled
the
facade
of
the
with
bullets
the
shutters
flew
into
splinters
one
window
which
had
been
left
was
torn
out
and
there
was
a
loud
rattle
of
broken
glass
pitiful
voices
were
crying
out
from
within
the
prisoners
the
prisoners
but
the
troops
did
not
hear
they
continued
firing
all
at
once
commander
sicardot
growing
exasperated
appeared
at
the
door
waved
his
arms
and
endeavoured
to
speak
monsieur
peirotte
the
receiver
of
taxes
with
his
slim
figure
and
scared
face
stood
by
his
side
however
another
volley
was
fired
and
monsieur
peirotte
fell
face
foremost
with
a
heavy
thud
to
the
ground
silvere
and
miette
were
still
looking
at
each
other
silvere
had
remained
by
the
corpse
through
all
the
fusillade
and
the
howls
of
agony
without
even
turning
his
head
he
was
only
conscious
of
the
presence
of
some
men
around
him
and
from
a
feeling
of
modesty
he
drew
the
red
banner
over
miette
s
breast
then
their
eyes
still
continued
to
gaze
at
one
another
the
conflict
however
was
at
an
end
the
death
of
the
receiver
of
taxes
had
satiated
the
soldiers
some
of
these
ran
about
scouring
every
corner
of
the
esplanade
to
prevent
the
escape
of
a
single
insurgent
a
gendarme
who
perceived
silvere
under
the
trees
ran
up
to
him
and
seeing
that
it
was
a
lad
he
had
to
deal
with
called
what
are
you
doing
there
youngster
silvere
whose
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
those
of
miette
made
no
reply
ah
the
bandit
his
hands
are
black
with
powder
the
gendarme
exclaimed
as
he
stooped
down
come
get
up
you
scoundrel
you
know
what
you
ve
got
to
then
as
silvere
only
smiled
vaguely
and
did
not
move
the
other
looked
more
attentively
and
saw
that
the
corpse
swathed
in
the
banner
was
that
of
a
girl
a
fine
girl
what
a
pity
he
muttered
your
mistress
eh
you
rascal
then
he
made
a
violent
grab
at
silvere
and
setting
him
on
his
feet
led
him
away
like
a
dog
that
is
dragged
by
one
leg
silvere
submitted
in
silence
as
quietly
as
a
child
he
just
turned
round
to
give
another
glance
at
miette
he
felt
distressed
at
thus
leaving
her
alone
under
the
trees
for
the
last
time
he
looked
at
her
from
afar
she
was
still
lying
there
in
all
her
purity
wrapped
in
the
red
banner
her
head
slightly
raised
and
her
big
eyes
turned
upward
towards
heaven
chapter
vi
it
was
about
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
when
rougon
at
last
ventured
to
leave
his
mother
s
house
the
old
woman
had
gone
to
sleep
on
a
chair
he
crept
stealthily
to
the
end
of
the
impasse
there
was
not
a
sound
not
a
shadow
he
pushed
on
as
far
as
the
porte
de
rome
the
gates
stood
wide
open
in
the
darkness
that
enveloped
the
slumbering
town
plassans
was
sleeping
as
sound
as
a
top
quite
unconscious
apparently
of
the
risk
it
was
running
in
allowing
the
gates
to
remain
unsecured
it
seemed
like
a
city
of
the
dead
rougon
taking
courage
made
his
way
into
the
rue
de
nice
he
scanned
from
a
distance
the
corners
of
each
successive
lane
and
trembled
at
every
door
fearing
lest
he
should
see
a
band
of
insurgents
rush
out
upon
him
however
he
reached
the
cours
sauvaire
without
any
mishap
the
insurgents
seemed
to
have
vanished
in
the
darkness
like
a
nightmare
pierre
then
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
deserted
pavement
heaving
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
triumph
so
those
rascals
had
really
abandoned
plassans
to
him
the
town
belonged
to
him
now
it
slept
like
the
foolish
thing
it
was
there
it
lay
dark
and
tranquil
silent
and
confident
and
he
had
only
to
stretch
out
his
hand
to
take
possession
of
it
that
brief
halt
the
supercilious
glance
which
he
cast
over
the
drowsy
place
thrilled
him
with
unspeakable
delight
he
remained
there
alone
in
the
darkness
and
crossed
his
arms
in
the
attitude
of
a
great
general
on
the
eve
of
a
victory
he
could
hear
nothing
in
the
distance
but
the
murmur
of
the
fountains
of
the
cours
sauvaire
whose
jets
of
water
fell
into
the
basins
with
a
musical
plashing
then
he
began
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
what
if
the
empire
should
unhappily
have
been
established
without
his
aid
what
if
sicardot
garconnet
and
peirotte
instead
of
being
arrested
and
led
away
by
the
insurrectionary
band
had
shut
the
rebels
up
in
prison
a
cold
perspiration
broke
out
over
him
and
he
went
on
his
way
again
hoping
that
felicite
would
give
him
some
accurate
information
he
now
pushed
on
more
rapidly
and
was
skirting
the
houses
of
the
rue
de
la
banne
when
a
strange
spectacle
which
caught
his
eyes
as
he
raised
his
head
riveted
him
to
the
ground
one
of
the
windows
of
the
yellow
was
brilliantly
illuminated
and
in
the
glare
he
saw
a
dark
form
which
he
recognized
as
that
of
his
wife
bending
forward
and
shaking
its
arms
in
a
violent
manner
he
asked
himself
what
this
could
mean
but
unable
to
think
of
any
explanation
was
beginning
to
feel
seriously
alarmed
when
some
hard
object
bounded
over
the
pavement
at
his
feet
felicite
had
thrown
him
the
key
of
the
where
he
had
concealed
a
supply
of
muskets
this
key
clearly
signified
that
he
must
take
up
arms
so
he
turned
away
again
unable
to
comprehend
why
his
wife
had
prevented
him
from
going
upstairs
and
imagining
the
most
horrible
things
he
now
went
straight
to
roudier
whom
he
found
dressed
and
ready
to
march
but
completely
ignorant
of
the
events
of
the
night
roudier
lived
at
the
far
end
of
the
new
town
as
in
a
desert
whither
no
tidings
of
the
insurgents
movements
had
penetrated
pierre
however
proposed
to
him
that
they
should
go
to
granoux
whose
house
stood
on
one
of
the
corners
of
the
place
des
recollets
and
under
whose
windows
the
insurgent
contingents
must
have
passed
the
municipal
councillor
s
servant
remained
for
a
long
time
parleying
before
consenting
to
admit
them
and
they
heard
poor
granoux
calling
from
the
first
floor
in
a
trembling
voice
don
t
open
the
door
catherine
the
streets
are
full
of
he
was
in
his
bedroom
in
the
dark
when
he
recognised
his
two
faithful
friends
he
felt
relieved
but
he
would
not
let
the
maid
bring
a
lamp
fearing
lest
the
light
might
attract
a
bullet
he
seemed
to
think
that
the
town
was
still
full
of
insurgents
lying
back
on
an
near
the
window
in
his
pants
and
with
a
silk
handkerchief
round
his
head
he
moaned
ah
my
friends
if
you
only
knew
i
tried
to
go
to
bed
but
they
were
making
such
a
disturbance
at
last
i
lay
down
in
my
here
i
ve
seen
it
all
everything
such
men
a
band
of
escaped
convicts
then
they
passed
by
again
dragging
brave
commander
sicardot
worthy
monsieur
garconnet
the
postmaster
and
others
away
with
them
and
howling
the
while
like
cannibals
rougon
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
he
made
granoux
repeat
to
him
how
he
had
seen
the
mayor
and
the
others
surrounded
by
the
i
saw
it
all
the
poor
man
wailed
i
was
standing
behind
the
blind
they
had
just
seized
monsieur
peirotte
and
i
heard
him
saying
as
he
passed
under
my
window
gentlemen
don
t
hurt
me
they
were
certainly
maltreating
him
it
s
abominable
however
roudier
calmed
granoux
by
assuring
him
that
the
town
was
free
and
the
worthy
gentleman
began
to
feel
quite
a
glow
of
martial
ardour
when
pierre
informed
him
that
he
had
come
to
recruit
his
services
for
the
purpose
of
saving
plassans
these
three
saviours
then
took
council
together
they
each
resolved
to
go
and
rouse
their
friends
and
appoint
a
meeting
at
the
the
secret
arsenal
of
the
reactionary
party
meantime
rougon
constantly
bethought
himself
of
felicite
s
wild
gestures
which
seemed
to
betoken
danger
somewhere
granoux
assuredly
the
most
foolish
of
the
three
was
the
first
to
suggest
that
there
must
be
some
republicans
left
in
the
town
this
proved
a
flash
of
light
and
rougon
with
a
feeling
of
conviction
reflected
there
must
be
something
of
macquart
s
doing
under
all
an
hour
or
so
later
the
friends
met
again
in
the
which
was
situated
in
a
very
lonely
spot
they
had
glided
stealthily
from
door
to
door
knocking
and
ringing
as
quietly
as
possible
and
picking
up
all
the
men
they
could
however
they
had
only
succeeded
in
collecting
some
forty
who
arrived
one
after
the
other
creeping
along
in
the
dark
with
the
pale
and
drowsy
countenances
of
men
who
had
been
violently
startled
from
their
sleep
the
let
to
a
cooper
was
littered
with
old
hoops
and
broken
casks
of
which
there
were
piles
in
every
corner
the
guns
were
stored
in
the
middle
in
three
long
boxes
a
taper
stuck
on
a
piece
of
wood
illumined
the
strange
scene
with
a
flickering
glimmer
when
rougon
had
removed
the
covers
of
the
three
boxes
the
spectacle
became
weirdly
grotesque
above
the
whose
barrels
shown
with
a
bluish
phosphorescent
glitter
were
outstretched
necks
and
heads
that
bent
with
a
sort
of
secret
fear
while
the
yellow
light
of
the
taper
cast
shadows
of
huge
noses
and
locks
of
stiffened
hair
upon
the
walls
however
the
reactionary
forces
counted
their
numbers
and
the
smallness
of
the
total
filled
them
with
hesitation
they
were
only
all
told
and
this
adventure
would
mean
certain
death
for
them
a
father
of
a
family
spoke
of
his
children
others
without
troubling
themselves
about
excuses
turned
towards
the
door
then
however
two
fresh
conspirators
arrived
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
town
hall
and
knew
for
certain
that
there
were
not
more
than
about
twenty
republicans
still
at
the
mayor
s
the
band
thereupon
deliberated
afresh
against
twenty
these
seemed
practicable
conditions
so
the
arms
were
distributed
amid
a
little
trembling
it
was
rougon
who
took
them
from
the
boxes
and
each
man
present
as
he
received
his
gun
the
barrel
of
which
on
that
december
night
was
icy
cold
felt
a
sudden
chill
freeze
him
to
his
bones
the
shadows
on
the
walls
assumed
the
clumsy
postures
of
bewildered
conscripts
stretching
out
their
fingers
pierre
closed
the
boxes
regretfully
he
left
there
a
hundred
and
nine
guns
which
he
would
willingly
have
distributed
however
he
now
had
to
divide
the
cartridges
of
these
there
were
two
large
barrels
full
in
the
furthest
corner
of
the
sufficient
to
defend
plassans
against
an
army
and
as
this
corner
was
dark
one
of
the
gentlemen
brought
the
taper
near
whereupon
another
conspirator
a
burly
with
immense
fists
grew
angry
declaring
that
it
was
most
imprudent
to
bring
a
light
so
close
they
strongly
approved
his
words
so
the
cartridges
were
distributed
in
the
dark
they
completely
filled
their
pockets
with
them
then
after
they
had
loaded
their
guns
with
endless
precautions
they
lingered
there
for
another
moment
looking
at
each
other
with
suspicious
eyes
or
exchanging
glances
in
which
cowardly
ferocity
was
mingled
with
an
expression
of
stupidity
in
the
streets
they
kept
close
to
the
houses
marching
silently
and
in
single
file
like
savages
on
the
rougon
had
insisted
upon
having
the
honour
of
marching
at
their
head
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
needs
run
some
risk
if
he
wanted
to
see
his
schemes
successful
drops
of
perspiration
poured
down
his
forehead
in
spite
of
the
cold
nevertheless
he
preserved
a
very
martial
bearing
roudier
and
granoux
were
immediately
behind
him
upon
two
occasions
the
column
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
they
fancied
they
had
heard
some
distant
sound
of
fighting
but
it
was
only
the
jingle
of
the
little
brass
hanging
from
chains
which
are
used
as
signs
by
the
barbers
of
southern
france
these
dishes
were
gently
shaking
to
and
fro
in
the
breeze
after
each
halt
the
saviours
of
plassans
continued
their
stealthy
march
in
the
dark
retaining
the
while
the
mien
of
terrified
heroes
in
this
manner
they
reached
the
square
in
front
of
the
town
hall
there
they
formed
a
group
round
rougon
and
took
counsel
together
once
more
in
the
facade
of
the
building
in
front
of
them
only
one
window
was
lighted
it
was
now
nearly
seven
o
clock
and
the
dawn
was
approaching
after
a
good
ten
minutes
discussion
it
was
decided
to
advance
as
far
as
the
door
so
as
to
ascertain
what
might
be
the
meaning
of
this
disquieting
darkness
and
silence
the
door
proved
to
be
half
open
one
of
the
conspirators
thereupon
popped
his
head
in
but
quickly
withdrew
it
announcing
that
there
was
a
man
under
the
porch
sitting
against
the
wall
fast
asleep
with
a
gun
between
his
legs
rougon
seeing
a
chance
of
commencing
with
a
deed
of
valour
thereupon
entered
first
and
seizing
the
man
held
him
down
while
roudier
gagged
him
this
first
triumph
gained
in
silence
singularly
emboldened
the
little
troop
who
had
dreamed
of
a
murderous
fusillade
and
rougon
had
to
make
imperious
signs
to
restrain
his
soldiers
from
indulging
in
delight
they
continued
their
advance
on
then
on
the
left
in
the
police
which
was
situated
there
they
perceived
some
fifteen
men
lying
on
and
snoring
amid
the
dim
glimmer
of
a
lantern
hanging
from
the
wall
rougon
who
was
decidedly
becoming
a
great
general
left
half
of
his
men
in
front
of
the
with
orders
not
to
rouse
the
sleepers
but
to
watch
them
and
make
them
prisoners
if
they
stirred
he
was
personally
uneasy
about
the
lighted
window
which
they
had
seen
from
the
square
he
still
scented
macquart
s
hand
in
the
business
and
as
he
felt
that
he
would
first
have
to
make
prisoners
of
those
who
were
watching
upstairs
he
was
not
sorry
to
be
able
to
adopt
surprise
tactics
before
the
noise
of
a
conflict
should
impel
them
to
barricade
themselves
in
the
rooms
so
he
went
up
quietly
followed
by
the
twenty
heroes
whom
he
still
had
at
his
disposal
roudier
commanded
the
detachment
remaining
in
the
courtyard
as
rougon
had
surmised
it
was
macquart
who
was
comfortably
installed
upstairs
in
the
mayor
s
office
he
sat
in
the
mayor
s
with
his
elbows
on
the
mayor
s
with
the
characteristic
confidence
of
a
man
of
coarse
intellect
who
is
absorbed
by
a
fixed
idea
and
bent
upon
his
own
triumph
he
had
imagined
after
the
departure
of
the
insurgents
that
plassans
was
now
at
his
complete
disposal
and
that
he
would
be
able
to
act
there
like
a
conqueror
in
his
opinion
that
body
of
three
thousand
men
who
had
just
passed
through
the
town
was
an
invincible
army
whose
mere
proximity
would
suffice
to
keep
the
bourgeois
humble
and
docile
in
his
hands
the
insurgents
had
imprisoned
the
gendarmes
in
their
barracks
the
national
guard
was
already
dismembered
the
nobility
must
be
quaking
with
terror
and
the
retired
citizens
of
the
new
town
had
certainly
never
handled
a
gun
in
their
lives
moreover
there
were
no
arms
any
more
than
there
were
soldiers
thus
macquart
did
not
even
take
the
precaution
to
have
the
gates
shut
his
men
carried
their
confidence
still
further
by
falling
asleep
while
he
calmly
awaited
the
dawn
which
he
fancied
would
attract
and
rally
all
the
republicans
of
the
district
round
him
he
was
already
meditating
important
revolutionary
measures
the
nomination
of
a
commune
of
which
he
would
be
the
chief
the
imprisonment
of
all
bad
patriots
and
particularly
of
all
such
persons
as
had
incurred
his
displeasure
the
thought
of
the
baffled
rougons
and
their
yellow
of
all
that
clique
entreating
him
for
mercy
thrilled
him
with
exquisite
pleasure
in
order
to
while
away
the
time
he
resolved
to
issue
a
proclamation
to
the
inhabitants
of
plassans
four
of
his
party
set
to
work
to
draw
up
this
proclamation
and
when
it
was
finished
macquart
assuming
a
dignified
manner
in
the
mayor
s
had
it
read
to
him
before
sending
it
to
the
printing
office
of
the
independant
on
whose
patriotism
he
reckoned
one
of
the
writers
was
commencing
in
an
emphatic
voice
inhabitants
of
plassans
the
hour
of
independence
has
struck
the
reign
of
justice
has
begun
when
a
noise
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
office
which
was
slowly
pushed
open
is
it
you
cassoute
macquart
asked
interrupting
the
perusal
nobody
answered
but
the
door
opened
wider
come
in
do
he
continued
impatiently
is
my
brigand
of
a
brother
at
home
then
all
at
once
both
leaves
of
the
door
were
violently
thrown
back
and
slammed
against
the
walls
and
a
crowd
of
armed
men
in
the
midst
of
whom
marched
rougon
with
his
face
very
red
and
his
eyes
starting
out
of
their
sockets
swarmed
into
the
office
brandishing
their
guns
like
cudgels
ah
the
blackguards
they
re
armed
shouted
macquart
he
was
about
to
seize
a
pair
of
pistols
which
were
lying
on
the
when
five
men
caught
hold
of
him
by
the
throat
and
held
him
in
check
the
four
authors
of
the
proclamation
struggled
for
an
instant
there
was
a
good
deal
of
scuffling
and
stamping
and
a
noise
of
persons
falling
the
combatants
were
greatly
hampered
by
their
guns
which
they
would
not
lay
aside
although
they
could
not
use
them
in
the
struggle
rougon
s
weapon
which
an
insurgent
had
tried
to
wrest
from
him
went
off
of
itself
with
a
frightful
report
and
filled
the
room
with
smoke
the
bullet
shattered
a
magnificent
mirror
that
reached
from
the
mantelpiece
to
the
ceiling
and
was
reputed
to
be
one
of
the
finest
mirrors
in
the
town
this
shot
fired
no
one
knew
why
deafened
everybody
and
put
an
end
to
the
battle
then
while
the
gentlemen
were
panting
and
puffing
three
other
reports
were
heard
in
the
courtyard
granoux
immediately
rushed
to
one
of
the
windows
and
as
he
and
the
others
anxiously
leaned
out
their
faces
lengthened
perceptibly
for
they
were
in
nowise
eager
for
a
struggle
with
the
men
in
the
whom
they
had
forgotten
amidst
their
triumph
however
roudier
cried
out
from
below
that
all
was
right
and
granoux
then
shut
the
window
again
beaming
with
joy
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
rougon
s
shot
had
aroused
the
sleepers
who
had
promptly
surrendered
seeing
that
resistance
was
impossible
then
however
three
of
roudier
s
men
in
their
blind
haste
to
get
the
business
over
had
discharged
their
firearms
in
the
air
as
a
sort
of
answer
to
the
report
from
above
without
knowing
quite
why
they
did
so
it
frequently
happens
that
guns
go
off
of
their
own
accord
when
they
are
in
the
hands
of
cowards
and
now
in
the
room
upstairs
rougon
ordered
macquart
s
hands
to
be
bound
with
the
bands
of
the
large
green
curtains
which
hung
at
the
windows
at
this
macquart
wild
with
rage
broke
into
scornful
jeers
all
right
go
on
he
muttered
this
evening
or
when
the
others
return
we
ll
settle
accounts
this
allusion
to
the
insurrectionary
forces
sent
a
shudder
to
the
victors
very
marrow
rougon
for
his
part
almost
choked
his
brother
who
was
exasperated
at
having
been
surprised
like
a
child
by
these
terrified
bourgeois
who
old
soldier
that
he
was
he
disdainfully
looked
upon
as
civilians
defied
him
with
a
glance
of
the
bitterest
hatred
ah
i
can
tell
some
pretty
stories
about
you
very
pretty
ones
the
rascal
exclaimed
without
removing
his
eyes
from
the
retired
oil
merchant
just
send
me
before
the
assize
court
so
that
i
may
tell
the
judge
a
few
tales
that
will
make
them
at
this
rougon
turned
pale
he
was
terribly
afraid
lest
macquart
should
blab
then
and
there
and
ruin
him
in
the
esteem
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
just
been
assisting
him
to
save
plassans
these
gentlemen
astounded
by
the
dramatic
encounter
between
the
two
brothers
and
foreseeing
some
stormy
passages
had
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
room
rougon
however
formed
a
heroic
resolution
he
advanced
towards
the
group
and
in
a
very
proud
tone
exclaimed
we
will
keep
this
man
here
when
he
has
reflected
on
his
position
he
will
be
able
to
give
us
some
useful
then
in
a
still
more
dignified
voice
he
went
on
i
will
discharge
my
duty
gentlemen
i
have
sworn
to
save
the
town
from
anarchy
and
i
will
save
it
even
should
i
have
to
be
the
executioner
of
my
nearest
one
might
have
thought
him
some
old
roman
sacrificing
his
family
on
the
altar
of
his
country
granoux
who
felt
deeply
moved
came
to
press
his
hand
with
a
tearful
countenance
which
seemed
to
say
i
understand
you
you
are
sublime
and
then
he
did
him
the
kindness
to
take
everybody
away
under
the
pretext
of
conducting
the
four
other
prisoners
into
the
courtyard
when
pierre
was
alone
with
his
brother
he
felt
all
his
return
to
him
you
hardly
expected
me
did
you
he
resumed
i
understand
things
now
you
have
been
laying
plots
against
me
you
wretched
fellow
see
what
your
vices
and
disorderly
life
have
brought
you
to
macquart
shrugged
his
shoulders
shut
up
he
replied
go
to
the
devil
you
re
an
old
rogue
he
laughs
best
who
laughs
thereupon
rougon
who
had
formed
no
definite
plan
with
regard
to
him
thrust
him
into
a
whither
monsieur
garconnet
retired
to
rest
sometimes
this
room
lighted
from
above
had
no
other
means
of
exit
than
the
doorway
by
which
one
entered
it
was
furnished
with
a
few
a
sofa
and
a
marble
pierre
the
door
after
partially
unbinding
his
brother
s
hands
macquart
was
then
heard
to
throw
himself
on
the
sofa
and
start
singing
the
ca
ira
in
a
loud
voice
as
though
he
were
trying
to
sing
himself
to
sleep
rougon
who
at
last
found
himself
alone
now
in
his
turn
sat
down
in
the
mayor
s
he
heaved
a
sigh
as
he
wiped
his
brow
how
hard
indeed
it
was
to
win
fortune
and
honours
however
he
was
nearing
the
end
at
last
he
felt
the
soft
seat
of
the
yield
beneath
him
while
with
a
mechanical
movement
he
caressed
the
mahogany
with
his
hands
finding
it
apparently
quite
silky
and
delicate
like
the
skin
of
a
beautiful
woman
then
he
spread
himself
out
and
assumed
the
dignified
attitude
which
macquart
had
previously
affected
while
listening
to
the
proclamation
the
silence
of
the
room
seemed
fraught
with
religious
solemnity
which
inspired
rougon
with
exquisite
delight
everything
even
the
dust
and
the
old
documents
lying
in
the
corners
seemed
to
exhale
an
odour
of
incense
which
rose
to
his
dilated
nostrils
this
room
with
its
faded
hangings
redolent
of
petty
transactions
all
the
trivial
concerns
of
a
municipality
became
a
temple
of
which
he
was
the
god
nevertheless
amidst
his
rapture
he
started
nervously
at
every
shout
from
macquart
the
words
aristocrat
and
the
threats
of
hanging
that
form
the
refrain
of
the
famous
revolutionary
song
the
ca
ira
reached
him
in
angry
bursts
interrupting
his
triumphant
dream
in
the
most
disagreeable
manner
always
that
man
and
his
dream
in
which
he
saw
plassans
at
his
feet
ended
with
a
sudden
vision
of
the
assize
court
of
the
judges
the
jury
and
the
public
listening
to
macquart
s
disgraceful
revelations
the
story
of
the
fifty
thousand
francs
and
many
other
unpleasant
matters
or
else
while
enjoying
the
softness
of
monsieur
garconnet
s
he
suddenly
pictured
himself
suspended
from
a
in
the
rue
de
la
banne
who
would
rid
him
of
that
wretched
fellow
at
last
antoine
fell
asleep
and
then
pierre
enjoyed
ten
good
minutes
pure
ecstasy
roudier
and
granoux
came
to
rouse
him
from
this
state
of
beatitude
they
had
just
returned
from
the
prison
whither
they
had
taken
the
insurgents
daylight
was
coming
on
apace
the
town
would
soon
be
awake
and
it
was
necessary
to
take
some
decisive
step
roudier
declared
that
before
anything
else
it
would
be
advisable
to
issue
a
proclamation
to
the
inhabitants
pierre
was
at
that
moment
reading
the
one
which
the
insurgents
had
left
upon
the
table
why
cried
he
this
will
suit
us
admirably
there
are
only
a
few
words
to
be
and
in
fact
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sufficed
for
the
necessary
changes
after
which
granoux
read
out
in
an
earnest
voice
inhabitants
of
plassans
the
hour
of
resistance
has
struck
the
reign
of
order
has
returned
it
was
decided
that
the
proclamation
should
be
printed
at
the
office
of
the
gazette
and
posted
at
all
the
street
corners
now
listen
said
rougon
we
ll
go
to
my
house
and
in
the
meantime
monsieur
granoux
will
assemble
here
the
members
of
the
municipal
council
who
had
not
been
arrested
and
acquaint
them
with
the
terrible
events
of
the
then
he
added
majestically
i
am
quite
prepared
to
accept
the
responsibility
of
my
actions
if
what
i
have
already
done
appears
a
satisfactory
pledge
of
my
desire
for
order
i
am
willing
to
place
myself
at
the
head
of
a
municipal
commission
until
such
time
as
the
regular
authorities
can
be
reinstated
but
in
order
that
nobody
may
accuse
me
of
ambitious
designs
i
shall
not
the
town
hall
unless
called
upon
to
do
so
by
my
at
this
granoux
and
roudier
protested
that
plassans
would
not
be
ungrateful
their
friend
had
indeed
saved
the
town
and
they
recalled
all
that
he
had
done
for
the
cause
of
order
the
yellow
always
open
to
the
friends
of
authority
his
services
as
spokesman
in
the
three
quarters
of
the
town
the
store
of
arms
which
had
been
his
idea
and
especially
that
memorable
night
that
night
of
prudence
and
heroism
in
which
he
had
rendered
himself
forever
illustrious
granoux
added
that
he
felt
sure
of
the
admiration
and
gratitude
of
the
municipal
councillors
don
t
stir
from
your
house
he
concluded
i
will
come
and
fetch
you
to
lead
you
back
in
then
roudier
said
that
he
quite
understood
the
tact
and
modesty
of
their
friend
and
approved
it
nobody
would
think
of
accusing
him
of
ambition
but
all
would
appreciate
the
delicacy
which
prompted
him
to
take
no
office
save
with
the
consent
of
his
that
was
very
dignified
very
noble
altogether
grand
under
this
shower
of
eulogies
rougon
humbly
bowed
his
head
no
no
you
go
too
far
he
murmured
with
voluptuous
thrillings
of
exquisite
pleasure
each
sentence
that
fell
from
the
retired
hosier
and
the
old
who
stood
on
his
right
and
left
respectively
fell
sweetly
on
his
ears
and
leaning
back
in
the
mayor
s
steeped
in
the
odour
of
officiality
which
pervaded
the
room
he
bowed
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
like
a
royal
pretender
whom
a
d
is
about
to
convert
into
an
emperor
when
they
were
tired
of
belauding
each
other
they
all
three
went
downstairs
granoux
started
off
to
call
the
municipal
council
together
while
roudier
told
rougon
to
go
on
in
front
saying
that
he
would
join
him
at
his
house
after
giving
the
necessary
orders
for
guarding
the
town
hall
the
dawn
was
now
fast
rising
and
pierre
proceeded
to
the
rue
de
la
banne
tapping
his
heels
in
a
martial
manner
on
the
still
deserted
pavement
he
carried
his
hat
in
his
hand
in
spite
of
the
bitter
cold
for
puffs
of
pride
sent
all
his
blood
to
his
head
on
reaching
his
house
he
found
cassoute
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
the
navvy
had
not
stirred
for
he
had
seen
nobody
enter
he
sat
there
on
the
first
step
resting
his
big
head
in
his
hands
and
gazing
fixedly
in
front
of
him
with
the
vacant
stare
and
mute
stubbornness
of
a
faithful
dog
you
were
waiting
for
me
weren
t
you
pierre
said
to
him
taking
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
well
go
and
tell
monsieur
macquart
that
i
ve
come
home
go
and
ask
for
him
at
the
town
cassoute
rose
and
took
himself
off
with
an
awkward
bow
he
was
going
to
get
himself
arrested
like
a
lamb
to
the
great
delight
of
pierre
who
laughed
as
he
went
upstairs
asking
himself
with
a
feeling
of
vague
surprise
i
have
certainly
plenty
of
courage
shall
i
turn
out
as
good
a
diplomatist
felicite
had
not
gone
to
bed
last
night
he
found
her
dressed
in
her
sunday
clothes
wearing
a
cap
with
ribbons
like
a
lady
expecting
visitors
she
had
sat
at
the
window
in
vain
she
had
heard
nothing
and
was
dying
with
curiosity
well
she
asked
rushing
to
meet
her
husband
the
latter
quite
out
of
breath
entered
the
yellow
whither
she
followed
him
carefully
closing
the
door
behind
her
he
sank
into
an
and
in
a
gasping
voice
faltered
it
s
done
we
shall
get
the
at
this
she
fell
on
his
neck
and
kissed
him
really
really
she
cried
but
i
haven
t
heard
anything
oh
my
darling
husband
do
tell
me
tell
me
all
she
felt
fifteen
years
old
again
and
began
to
coax
him
and
whirl
round
him
like
a
grasshopper
fascinated
by
the
light
and
heat
and
pierre
in
the
effusion
of
his
triumph
poured
out
his
heart
to
her
he
did
not
omit
a
single
detail
he
even
explained
his
future
projects
forgetting
that
according
to
his
theories
wives
were
good
for
nothing
and
that
his
must
be
kept
in
complete
ignorance
of
what
went
on
if
he
wished
to
remain
master
felicite
leant
over
him
and
drank
in
his
words
she
made
him
repeat
certain
parts
of
his
story
declaring
she
had
not
heard
in
fact
her
delight
bewildered
her
so
much
that
at
times
she
seemed
quite
deaf
when
pierre
related
the
events
at
the
town
hall
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
changed
her
chair
three
times
and
moved
the
furniture
about
quite
unable
to
sit
still
after
forty
years
of
continuous
struggle
fortune
had
at
last
yielded
to
them
eventually
she
became
so
mad
over
it
that
she
forgot
all
prudence
it
s
to
me
you
owe
all
this
she
exclaimed
in
an
outburst
of
triumph
if
i
hadn
t
looked
after
you
you
would
have
been
nicely
taken
in
by
the
insurgents
you
booby
it
was
garconnet
sicardot
and
the
others
that
had
got
to
be
thrown
to
those
wild
then
showing
her
teeth
loosened
by
age
she
added
with
a
girlish
smile
well
the
republic
for
ever
it
has
made
our
path
but
pierre
had
turned
cross
that
s
just
like
you
he
muttered
you
always
fancy
that
you
ve
foreseen
everything
it
was
i
who
had
the
idea
of
hiding
myself
as
though
women
understood
anything
about
politics
bah
my
poor
girl
if
you
were
to
steer
the
bark
we
should
very
soon
be
felicite
bit
her
lip
she
had
gone
too
far
and
forgotten
her
part
of
good
silent
fairy
then
she
was
seized
with
one
of
those
fits
of
covert
exasperation
which
she
generally
experienced
when
her
husband
tried
to
crush
her
with
his
superiority
and
she
again
promised
herself
when
the
right
time
should
arrive
some
exquisite
revenge
which
would
deliver
this
man
into
her
power
bound
hand
and
foot
ah
i
was
forgetting
resumed
rougon
monsieur
peirotte
is
amongst
them
granoux
saw
him
struggling
in
the
hands
of
the
felicite
gave
a
start
she
was
just
at
that
moment
standing
at
the
window
gazing
with
longing
eyes
at
the
house
where
the
receiver
of
taxes
lived
she
had
felt
a
desire
to
do
so
for
in
her
mind
the
idea
of
triumph
was
always
associated
with
envy
of
that
fine
house
so
monsieur
peirotte
is
arrested
she
exclaimed
in
a
strange
tone
as
she
turned
round
for
an
instant
she
smiled
complacently
then
a
crimson
blush
rushed
to
her
face
a
murderous
wish
had
just
ascended
from
the
depths
of
her
being
ah
if
the
insurgents
would
only
kill
him
pierre
no
doubt
read
her
thoughts
in
her
eyes
well
if
some
ball
were
to
hit
him
he
muttered
our
business
would
be
settled
there
would
be
no
necessity
to
supercede
him
eh
and
it
would
be
no
fault
of
but
felicite
shuddered
she
felt
that
she
had
just
condemned
a
man
to
death
if
monsieur
peirotte
should
now
be
killed
she
would
always
see
his
ghost
at
night
time
he
would
come
and
haunt
her
so
she
only
ventured
to
cast
furtive
glances
full
of
fearful
delight
at
the
unhappy
man
s
windows
henceforward
all
her
enjoyment
would
be
fraught
with
a
touch
of
guilty
terror
moreover
pierre
having
now
poured
out
his
soul
began
to
perceive
the
other
side
of
the
situation
he
mentioned
macquart
how
could
they
get
rid
of
that
blackguard
but
felicite
again
fired
with
enthusiasm
exclaimed
oh
one
can
t
do
everything
at
once
we
ll
gag
him
somehow
we
ll
soon
find
some
means
or
she
was
now
walking
to
and
fro
putting
the
in
order
and
dusting
their
backs
suddenly
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
gave
the
faded
furniture
a
long
glance
good
heavens
she
said
how
ugly
it
is
here
and
we
shall
have
everybody
coming
to
call
upon
us
bah
replied
pierre
with
supreme
indifference
we
ll
alter
all
he
who
the
night
before
had
entertained
almost
religious
veneration
for
the
and
the
sofa
would
now
have
willingly
stamped
on
them
felicite
who
felt
the
same
contempt
even
went
so
far
as
to
upset
an
which
was
short
of
a
castor
and
did
not
yield
to
her
quickly
enough
it
was
at
this
moment
that
roudier
entered
it
at
once
occurred
to
the
old
woman
that
he
had
become
much
more
polite
his
monsieur
and
madame
rolled
forth
in
delightfully
musical
fashion
but
the
other
habitues
were
now
arriving
one
after
the
other
and
the
was
fast
getting
full
nobody
yet
knew
the
full
particulars
of
the
events
of
the
night
and
all
had
come
in
haste
with
wondering
eyes
and
smiling
lips
urged
on
by
the
rumours
which
were
beginning
to
circulate
through
the
town
these
gentlemen
who
on
the
previous
evening
had
left
the
with
such
precipitation
at
the
news
of
the
insurgents
approach
came
back
inquisitive
and
importunate
like
a
swarm
of
buzzing
flies
which
a
puff
of
wind
would
have
dispersed
some
of
them
had
not
even
taken
time
to
put
on
their
braces
they
were
very
impatient
but
it
was
evident
that
rougon
was
waiting
for
some
one
else
before
speaking
out
he
constantly
turned
an
anxious
look
towards
the
door
for
an
hour
there
was
only
significant
vague
congratulation
admiring
whispering
suppressed
joy
of
uncertain
origin
which
only
awaited
a
word
of
enlightenment
to
turn
to
enthusiasm
at
last
granoux
appeared
he
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
with
his
right
hand
pressed
to
his
breast
between
the
buttons
of
his
his
broad
pale
face
was
beaming
in
vain
he
strove
to
conceal
his
emotion
beneath
an
expression
of
dignity
all
the
others
became
silent
on
perceiving
him
they
felt
that
something
extraordinary
was
about
to
take
place
granoux
walked
straight
up
to
rougon
through
two
lines
of
visitors
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
my
friend
he
said
i
bring
you
the
homage
of
the
municipal
council
they
call
you
to
their
head
until
our
mayor
shall
be
restored
to
us
you
have
saved
plassans
in
the
terrible
crisis
through
which
we
are
passing
we
want
men
who
like
yourself
unite
intelligence
with
courage
come
at
this
point
granoux
who
was
reciting
a
little
speech
which
he
had
taken
great
trouble
to
prepare
on
his
way
from
the
town
hall
to
the
rue
de
la
banne
felt
his
memory
fail
him
but
rougon
overwhelmed
with
emotion
broke
in
shaking
his
hand
and
repeating
thank
you
my
dear
granoux
i
thank
you
very
he
could
find
nothing
else
to
say
however
a
loud
burst
of
voices
followed
every
one
rushed
upon
him
tried
to
shake
hands
poured
forth
praises
and
compliments
and
eagerly
questioned
him
but
he
already
putting
on
official
dignity
begged
for
a
few
minutes
delay
in
order
that
he
might
confer
with
messieurs
granoux
and
roudier
business
before
everything
the
town
was
in
such
a
critical
situation
then
the
three
accomplices
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
where
in
an
undertone
they
divided
power
amongst
themselves
the
rest
of
the
visitors
who
remained
a
few
paces
away
trying
meanwhile
to
look
extremely
wise
and
furtively
glancing
at
them
with
mingled
admiration
and
curiosity
it
was
decided
that
rougon
should
take
the
title
of
president
of
the
municipal
commission
granoux
was
to
be
secretary
whilst
as
for
roudier
he
became
of
the
reorganised
national
guard
they
also
swore
to
support
each
other
against
all
opposition
however
felicite
who
had
drawn
near
abruptly
inquired
and
vuillet
at
this
they
looked
at
each
other
nobody
had
seen
vuillet
rougon
seemed
somewhat
uneasy
perhaps
they
ve
taken
him
away
with
the
others
he
said
to
ease
his
mind
but
felicite
shook
her
head
vuillet
was
not
the
man
to
let
himself
be
arrested
since
nobody
had
seen
or
heard
him
it
was
certain
he
had
been
doing
something
wrong
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
vuillet
entered
bowing
humbly
with
blinking
glance
and
stiff
sacristan
s
smile
then
he
held
out
his
moist
hand
to
rougon
and
the
two
others
vuillet
had
settled
his
little
affairs
alone
he
had
cut
his
own
slice
out
of
the
cake
as
felicite
would
have
said
while
peeping
through
the
ventilator
of
his
cellar
he
had
seen
the
insurgents
arrest
the
postmaster
whose
offices
were
near
his
bookshop
at
daybreak
therefore
at
the
moment
when
rougon
was
comfortably
seated
in
the
mayor
s
he
had
quietly
installed
himself
in
the
postmaster
s
office
he
knew
the
clerks
so
he
received
them
on
their
arrival
told
them
that
he
would
replace
their
chief
until
his
return
and
that
meantime
they
need
be
in
nowise
uneasy
then
he
ransacked
the
morning
mail
with
curiosity
he
examined
the
letters
and
seemed
to
be
seeking
a
particular
one
his
new
berth
doubtless
suited
his
secret
plans
for
his
satisfaction
became
so
great
that
he
actually
gave
one
of
the
clerks
a
copy
of
the
oeuvres
badines
de
vuillet
it
should
be
mentioned
did
business
in
objectionable
literature
which
he
kept
concealed
in
a
large
drawer
under
the
stock
of
heads
and
religious
images
it
is
probable
that
he
felt
some
slight
qualms
at
the
manner
in
which
he
had
taken
possession
of
the
post
office
and
recognised
the
desirability
of
getting
his
usurpation
confirmed
as
far
as
possible
at
all
events
he
had
thought
it
well
to
call
upon
rougon
who
was
fast
becoming
an
important
personage
why
where
have
you
been
felicite
asked
him
in
a
distrustful
manner
thereupon
he
related
his
story
with
sundry
embellishments
according
to
his
own
account
he
had
saved
the
from
pillage
all
right
then
that
s
settled
stay
on
there
said
pierre
after
a
moment
s
reflection
make
yourself
this
last
sentence
revealed
the
one
great
fear
that
possessed
the
rougons
they
were
afraid
that
some
one
might
prove
too
useful
and
do
more
than
themselves
to
save
the
town
still
pierre
saw
no
serious
danger
in
leaving
vuillet
as
provisional
postmaster
it
was
even
a
convenient
means
of
getting
rid
of
him
felicite
however
made
a
sharp
gesture
of
annoyance
the
consultation
having
ended
the
three
accomplices
mingled
with
the
various
groups
that
filled
the
they
were
at
last
obliged
to
satisfy
the
general
curiosity
by
giving
detailed
accounts
of
recent
events
rougon
proved
magnificent
he
exaggerated
embellished
and
dramatised
the
story
which
he
had
related
to
his
wife
the
distribution
of
the
guns
and
cartridges
made
everybody
hold
their
breath
but
it
was
the
march
through
the
deserted
streets
and
the
seizure
of
the
that
most
amazed
these
worthy
bourgeois
at
each
fresh
detail
there
was
an
interruption
and
you
were
only
it
s
marvellous
ah
indeed
it
must
have
been
frightfully
dark
no
i
confess
i
never
should
have
dared
it
then
you
seized
him
like
that
by
the
throat
and
the
insurgents
what
did
they
say
these
remarks
and
questions
only
incited
rougon
s
imagination
the
more
he
replied
to
everybody
he
mimicked
the
action
this
stout
man
in
his
admiration
of
his
own
achievements
became
as
nimble
as
a
schoolboy
he
began
afresh
repeated
himself
amidst
the
exclamations
of
surprise
and
individual
discussions
which
suddenly
arose
about
some
trifling
detail
and
thus
he
continued
blowing
his
trumpet
making
himself
more
and
more
important
as
if
some
irresistible
force
impelled
him
to
turn
his
narrative
into
a
genuine
epic
moreover
granoux
and
roudier
stood
by
his
side
prompting
him
reminding
him
of
such
trifling
matters
as
he
omitted
they
also
were
burning
to
put
in
a
word
and
occasionally
they
could
not
restrain
themselves
so
that
all
three
went
on
talking
together
when
in
order
to
keep
the
episode
of
the
broken
mirror
for
the
denouement
like
some
crowning
glory
rougon
began
to
describe
what
had
taken
place
downstairs
in
the
courtyard
after
the
arrest
of
the
guard
roudier
accused
him
of
spoiling
the
narrative
by
changing
the
sequence
of
events
for
a
moment
they
wrangled
about
it
somewhat
sharply
then
roudier
seeing
a
good
opportunity
for
himself
suddenly
exclaimed
very
well
let
it
be
so
but
you
weren
t
there
so
let
me
tell
he
thereupon
explained
at
great
length
how
the
insurgents
had
awoke
and
how
the
muskets
of
the
town
s
deliverers
had
been
levelled
at
them
to
reduce
them
to
impotence
he
added
however
that
no
blood
fortunately
had
been
shed
this
last
sentence
disappointed
his
audience
who
had
counted
upon
one
corpse
at
least
but
i
thought
you
fired
interrupted
felicite
recognising
that
the
story
was
wretchedly
deficient
in
dramatic
interest
yes
yes
three
shots
resumed
the
old
hosier
the
dubruel
monsieur
lievin
and
monsieur
massicot
discharged
their
guns
with
really
culpable
and
as
there
were
some
murmurs
at
this
remark
culpable
i
repeat
the
word
he
continued
there
are
quite
enough
cruel
necessities
in
warfare
without
any
useless
shedding
of
blood
besides
these
gentlemen
swore
to
me
that
it
was
not
their
fault
they
can
t
understand
how
it
was
their
guns
went
off
nevertheless
a
spent
ball
after
ricocheting
grazed
the
cheek
of
one
of
the
insurgents
and
left
a
mark
on
this
graze
this
unexpected
wound
satisfied
the
audience
which
cheek
right
or
left
had
been
grazed
and
how
was
it
that
a
bullet
a
spent
one
even
could
strike
a
cheek
without
piercing
it
these
points
supplied
material
for
some
long
discussions
meantime
continued
rougon
at
the
top
of
his
voice
without
giving
time
for
the
excitement
to
abate
meantime
we
had
plenty
to
do
upstairs
the
struggle
was
quite
then
he
described
at
length
the
arrival
of
his
brother
and
the
four
other
insurgents
without
naming
macquart
whom
he
simply
called
the
the
words
the
mayor
s
office
the
mayor
s
the
mayor
s
writing
table
recurred
to
him
every
instant
and
in
the
opinion
of
his
audience
imparted
marvellous
grandeur
to
the
terrible
scene
it
was
not
at
the
porter
s
lodge
that
the
fight
was
now
being
waged
but
in
the
private
sanctum
of
the
chief
magistrate
of
the
town
roudier
was
quite
cast
in
to
the
background
then
rougon
at
last
came
to
the
episode
which
he
had
been
keeping
in
reserve
from
the
commencement
and
which
would
certainly
exalt
him
to
the
dignity
of
a
hero
thereupon
said
he
an
insurgent
rushes
upon
me
i
push
the
mayor
s
away
and
seize
the
man
by
the
throat
i
hold
him
tightly
you
may
be
sure
of
it
but
my
gun
was
in
my
way
i
didn
t
want
to
let
it
drop
a
man
always
sticks
to
his
gun
i
held
it
like
this
under
the
left
arm
all
of
a
sudden
it
went
off
the
whole
audience
hung
on
rougon
s
lips
but
granoux
who
was
opening
his
mouth
wide
with
a
violent
itching
to
say
something
shouted
no
no
that
isn
t
right
you
were
not
in
a
position
to
see
things
my
friend
you
were
fighting
like
a
lion
but
i
saw
everything
while
i
was
helping
to
bind
one
of
the
prisoners
the
man
tried
to
murder
you
it
was
he
who
fired
the
gun
i
saw
him
distinctly
slip
his
black
fingers
under
your
really
said
rougon
turning
quite
pale
he
did
not
know
he
had
been
in
such
danger
and
the
old
almond
merchant
s
account
of
the
incident
chilled
him
with
fright
granoux
as
a
rule
did
not
lie
but
on
a
day
of
battle
it
is
surely
allowable
to
view
things
dramatically
i
tell
you
the
man
tried
to
murder
you
he
repeated
with
conviction
ah
said
rougon
in
a
faint
voice
that
s
how
it
is
i
heard
the
bullet
whiz
past
my
ear
at
this
violent
emotion
came
upon
the
audience
everybody
gazed
at
the
hero
with
respectful
awe
he
had
heard
a
bullet
whiz
past
his
ear
certainly
none
of
the
other
bourgeois
who
were
there
could
say
as
much
felicite
felt
bound
to
rush
into
her
husband
s
arms
so
as
to
work
up
the
emotion
to
boiling
point
but
rougon
immediately
freed
himself
and
concluded
his
narrative
with
this
heroic
sentence
which
has
become
famous
at
plassans
the
shot
goes
off
i
hear
the
bullet
whiz
past
my
ear
and
whish
it
smashes
the
mayor
s
this
caused
complete
consternation
such
a
magnificent
mirror
too
it
was
scarcely
credible
the
damage
done
to
that
almost
rougon
s
heroism
in
the
estimation
of
the
company
the
glass
became
an
object
of
absorbing
interest
and
they
talked
about
it
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
many
exclamations
and
expressions
of
regret
as
though
it
had
been
some
dear
friend
that
had
been
stricken
to
the
heart
this
was
the
culminating
point
that
rougon
had
aimed
at
the
denouement
of
his
wonderful
odyssey
a
loud
hubbub
of
voices
filled
the
yellow
the
visitors
were
repeating
what
they
had
just
heard
and
every
now
and
then
one
of
them
would
leave
a
group
to
ask
the
three
heroes
the
exact
truth
with
regard
to
some
contested
incident
the
heroes
set
the
matter
right
with
scrupulous
minuteness
for
they
felt
that
they
were
speaking
for
history
at
last
rougon
and
his
two
lieutenants
announced
that
they
were
expected
at
the
respectful
silence
was
then
restored
and
the
company
smiled
at
each
other
discreetly
granoux
was
swelling
with
importance
he
was
the
only
one
who
had
seen
the
insurgent
pull
the
trigger
and
smash
the
mirror
this
sufficed
to
exalt
him
and
almost
made
him
burst
his
skin
on
leaving
the
he
took
roudier
s
arm
with
the
air
of
a
great
general
who
is
broken
down
with
fatigue
i
ve
been
up
for
hours
he
murmured
and
heaven
alone
knows
when
i
shall
get
to
bed
rougon
as
he
withdrew
took
vuillet
aside
and
told
him
that
the
party
of
order
relied
more
than
ever
on
him
and
the
he
would
have
to
publish
an
effective
article
to
reassure
the
inhabitants
and
treat
the
band
of
villains
who
had
passed
through
plassans
as
it
deserved
be
easy
replied
vuillet
in
the
ordinary
course
the
gazette
ought
not
to
appear
till
morning
but
i
ll
issue
it
this
very
when
the
leaders
had
left
the
rest
of
the
visitors
remained
in
the
yellow
for
another
moment
chattering
like
so
many
old
women
whom
the
escape
of
a
canary
has
gathered
together
on
the
pavement
these
retired
tradesmen
oil
dealers
and
wholesale
hatters
felt
as
if
they
were
in
a
sort
of
fairyland
never
had
they
experienced
such
thrilling
excitement
before
they
could
not
get
over
their
surprise
at
discovering
such
heroes
as
rougon
granoux
and
roudier
in
their
midst
at
last
half
stifled
by
the
stuffy
atmosphere
and
tired
of
ever
telling
each
other
the
same
things
they
decided
to
go
off
and
spread
the
momentous
news
abroad
they
glided
away
one
by
one
each
anxious
to
have
the
glory
of
being
the
first
to
know
and
relate
everything
and
felicite
as
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
on
being
left
alone
saw
them
dispersing
in
the
rue
de
la
banne
waving
their
arms
in
an
excited
manner
eager
as
they
were
to
diffuse
emotion
to
the
four
corners
of
the
town
it
was
ten
o
clock
and
plassans
now
wide
awake
was
running
about
the
streets
wildly
excited
by
the
reports
which
were
circulating
those
who
had
seen
or
heard
the
insurrectionary
forces
related
the
most
foolish
stories
contradicting
each
other
and
indulging
in
the
wildest
suppositions
the
majority
however
knew
nothing
at
all
about
the
matter
they
lived
at
the
further
end
of
the
town
and
listened
with
gaping
mouths
like
children
to
a
nursery
tale
to
the
stories
of
how
several
thousand
bandits
had
invaded
the
streets
during
the
night
and
vanished
before
daybreak
like
an
army
of
phantoms
a
few
of
the
most
sceptical
said
nonsense
yet
some
of
the
details
were
very
precise
and
plassans
at
last
felt
convinced
that
some
frightful
danger
had
passed
over
it
while
it
slept
the
darkness
which
had
shrouded
this
danger
the
various
contradictory
reports
that
spread
all
invested
the
matter
with
mystery
and
vague
horror
which
made
the
bravest
shudder
whose
hand
had
diverted
the
thunderbolt
from
them
there
seemed
to
be
something
quite
miraculous
about
it
there
were
rumours
of
unknown
deliverers
of
a
handful
of
brave
men
who
had
cut
off
the
hydra
s
head
but
no
one
seemed
acquainted
with
the
exact
particulars
and
the
whole
story
appeared
scarcely
credible
until
the
company
from
the
yellow
spread
through
the
streets
scattering
tidings
ever
repeating
the
same
narrative
at
each
door
they
came
to
it
was
like
a
train
of
powder
in
a
few
minutes
the
story
had
spread
from
one
end
of
the
town
to
the
other
rougon
s
name
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
with
exclamations
of
surprise
in
the
new
town
and
of
praise
in
the
old
quarter
the
idea
of
being
without
a
a
mayor
a
postmaster
a
receiver
of
taxes
or
authorities
of
any
kind
at
first
threw
the
inhabitants
into
consternation
they
were
stupefied
at
having
been
able
to
sleep
through
the
night
and
get
up
as
usual
in
the
absence
of
any
settled
government
their
first
stupor
over
they
threw
themselves
recklessly
into
the
arms
of
their
liberators
the
few
republicans
shrugged
their
shoulders
but
the
petty
shopkeepers
the
small
householders
the
conservatives
of
all
shades
invoked
blessings
on
those
modest
heroes
whose
achievements
had
been
shrouded
by
the
night
when
it
was
known
that
rougon
had
arrested
his
own
brother
the
popular
admiration
knew
no
bounds
people
talked
of
brutus
and
thus
the
indiscretion
which
had
made
pierre
rather
anxious
really
redounded
to
his
glory
at
this
moment
when
terror
still
hovered
over
them
the
townsfolk
were
virtually
unanimous
in
their
gratitude
rougon
was
accepted
as
their
saviour
without
the
slightest
show
of
opposition
just
think
of
it
the
poltroons
exclaimed
there
were
only
of
them
that
number
of
amazed
the
whole
town
and
this
was
the
origin
of
the
plassans
legend
of
how
bourgeois
had
made
three
thousand
insurgents
bite
the
dust
there
were
only
a
few
envious
spirits
of
the
new
town
lawyers
without
work
and
retired
military
men
ashamed
of
having
slept
ingloriously
through
that
memorable
night
who
raised
any
doubts
the
insurgents
these
sceptics
hinted
had
no
doubt
left
the
town
of
their
own
accord
there
were
no
indications
of
a
combat
no
corpses
no
so
the
deliverers
had
certainly
had
a
very
easy
task
but
the
mirror
the
mirror
repeated
the
enthusiasts
you
can
t
deny
that
the
mayor
s
mirror
has
been
smashed
go
and
see
it
for
and
in
fact
until
quite
a
stream
of
town
flowed
under
one
pretext
or
another
into
the
mayor
s
private
office
the
door
of
which
rougon
left
wide
open
the
visitors
planted
themselves
in
front
of
the
mirror
which
the
bullet
had
pierced
and
starred
and
they
all
gave
vent
to
the
same
exclamation
by
jove
that
ball
must
have
had
terrible
force
then
they
departed
quite
convinced
felicite
at
her
window
listened
with
delight
to
all
the
rumours
and
laudatory
and
grateful
remarks
which
arose
from
the
town
at
that
moment
all
plassans
was
talking
of
her
husband
she
felt
that
the
two
districts
below
her
were
quivering
wafting
her
the
hope
of
approaching
triumph
ah
how
she
would
crush
that
town
which
she
had
been
so
long
in
getting
beneath
her
feet
all
her
grievances
crowded
back
to
her
memory
and
her
past
disappointments
redoubled
her
appetite
for
immediate
enjoyment
at
last
she
left
the
window
and
walked
slowly
round
the
it
was
there
that
a
little
while
previously
everybody
had
held
out
their
hands
to
her
husband
and
herself
he
and
she
had
conquered
the
citizens
were
at
their
feet
the
yellow
seemed
to
her
a
holy
place
the
dilapidated
furniture
the
frayed
velvet
the
chandelier
soiled
with
all
those
poor
wrecks
now
seemed
to
her
like
the
glorious
debris
of
a
the
plain
of
austerlitz
would
not
have
stirred
her
to
deeper
emotion
when
she
returned
to
the
window
she
perceived
aristide
wandering
about
the
place
of
the
with
his
nose
in
the
air
she
beckoned
to
him
to
come
up
which
he
immediately
did
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
only
been
waiting
for
this
invitation
come
in
his
mother
said
to
him
on
the
landing
seeing
that
he
hesitated
your
father
is
not
aristide
evinced
all
the
shyness
of
a
prodigal
son
returning
home
he
had
not
been
inside
the
yellow
for
nearly
four
years
he
still
carried
his
arm
in
a
sling
does
your
hand
still
pain
you
his
mother
asked
him
ironically
he
blushed
as
he
answered
with
some
embarrassment
oh
it
s
getting
better
it
s
nearly
well
again
then
he
lingered
there
loitering
about
and
not
knowing
what
to
say
felicite
came
to
the
rescue
i
suppose
you
ve
heard
them
talking
about
your
father
s
noble
conduct
she
resumed
he
replied
that
the
whole
town
was
talking
of
it
and
then
as
he
regained
his
he
paid
his
mother
back
for
her
raillery
in
her
own
coin
looking
her
full
in
the
face
he
added
i
came
to
see
if
father
was
come
don
t
play
the
fool
cried
felicite
petulantly
if
i
were
you
i
would
act
boldly
and
decisively
confess
now
that
you
made
a
false
move
in
joining
those
republicans
you
would
be
very
glad
i
m
sure
to
be
well
rid
of
them
and
to
return
to
us
who
are
the
stronger
party
well
the
house
is
open
to
you
but
aristide
protested
the
republic
was
a
grand
idea
moreover
the
insurgents
might
still
carry
the
day
don
t
talk
nonsense
to
me
retorted
the
old
woman
with
some
irritation
you
re
afraid
that
your
father
won
t
have
a
very
warm
welcome
for
you
but
i
ll
see
to
that
listen
to
me
go
back
to
your
newspaper
and
between
now
and
prepare
a
number
strongly
favouring
the
coup
d
etat
evening
when
this
number
has
appeared
come
back
here
and
you
will
be
received
with
open
then
seeing
that
the
young
man
remained
silent
do
you
hear
she
added
in
a
lower
and
more
eager
tone
it
is
necessary
for
our
sake
and
for
your
own
too
that
it
should
be
done
don
t
let
us
have
any
more
nonsense
and
folly
you
ve
already
compromised
yourself
enough
in
that
the
young
man
made
a
gesture
the
gesture
of
a
caesar
crossing
the
rubicon
and
by
doing
so
escaped
entering
into
any
verbal
engagement
as
he
was
about
to
withdraw
his
mother
looking
for
the
knot
in
his
sling
remarked
first
of
all
you
must
let
me
take
off
this
rag
it
s
getting
a
little
ridiculous
you
know
aristide
let
her
remove
it
when
the
silk
handkerchief
was
untied
he
folded
it
neatly
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
and
as
he
kissed
his
mother
he
exclaimed
till
then
in
the
meanwhile
rougon
was
taking
official
possession
of
the
mayor
s
offices
there
were
only
eight
municipal
councillors
left
the
others
were
in
the
hands
of
the
insurgents
as
well
as
the
mayor
and
his
two
assessors
the
eight
remaining
gentlemen
who
were
all
on
a
par
with
granoux
perspired
with
fright
when
the
latter
explained
to
them
the
critical
situation
of
the
town
it
requires
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
kind
of
men
who
compose
the
municipal
councils
of
some
of
the
smaller
towns
in
order
to
form
an
idea
of
the
terror
with
which
these
timid
folk
threw
themselves
into
rougon
s
arms
at
plassans
the
mayor
had
the
most
incredible
blockheads
under
him
men
without
any
ideas
of
their
own
and
accustomed
to
passive
obedience
consequently
as
monsieur
garconnet
was
no
longer
there
the
municipal
machine
was
bound
to
get
out
of
order
and
fall
completely
under
the
control
of
the
man
who
might
know
how
to
set
it
working
moreover
as
the
had
left
the
district
rougon
naturally
became
sole
and
absolute
master
of
the
town
and
thus
strange
to
relate
the
chief
administrative
authority
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
man
of
indifferent
repute
to
whom
on
the
previous
evening
not
one
of
his
would
have
lent
a
hundred
francs
pierre
s
first
act
was
to
declare
the
provisional
commission
en
then
he
gave
his
attention
to
the
organisation
of
the
national
guard
and
succeeded
in
raising
three
hundred
men
the
hundred
and
nine
muskets
left
in
the
were
also
distributed
to
volunteers
thereby
bringing
up
the
number
of
men
armed
by
the
reactionary
party
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
the
remaining
one
hundred
and
fifty
guards
consisted
of
citizens
and
some
of
sicardot
s
soldiers
when
commander
roudier
reviewed
the
little
army
in
front
of
the
he
was
annoyed
to
see
the
smiling
in
their
sleeves
the
fact
is
that
several
of
his
men
had
no
uniforms
and
some
of
them
looked
very
droll
with
their
black
hats
and
muskets
but
at
any
rate
they
meant
well
a
guard
was
left
at
the
and
the
rest
of
the
forces
were
sent
in
detachments
to
the
various
town
gates
roudier
reserved
to
himself
the
command
of
the
guard
stationed
at
the
grand
which
seemed
to
be
more
liable
to
attack
than
the
others
rougon
who
now
felt
very
conscious
of
his
power
repaired
to
the
rue
canquoin
to
beg
the
gendarmes
to
remain
in
their
barracks
and
interfere
with
nothing
he
certainly
had
the
doors
of
the
gendarmerie
opened
the
keys
having
been
carried
off
by
the
insurgents
but
he
wanted
to
triumph
alone
and
had
no
intention
of
letting
the
gendarmes
rob
him
of
any
part
of
his
glory
if
he
should
really
have
need
of
them
he
could
always
send
for
them
so
he
explained
to
them
that
their
presence
might
tend
to
irritate
the
and
thus
aggravate
the
situation
the
sergeant
in
command
thereupon
complimented
him
on
his
prudence
when
rougon
was
informed
that
there
was
a
wounded
man
in
the
barracks
he
asked
to
see
him
by
way
of
rendering
himself
popular
he
found
rengade
in
bed
with
his
eye
bandaged
and
his
big
moustaches
just
peeping
out
from
under
the
linen
with
some
words
about
duty
rougon
endeavoured
to
comfort
the
unfortunate
fellow
who
having
lost
an
eye
was
swearing
with
exasperation
at
the
thought
that
his
injury
would
compel
him
to
quit
the
service
at
last
rougon
promised
to
send
the
doctor
to
him
i
m
much
obliged
to
you
sir
rengade
replied
but
you
know
what
would
do
me
more
good
than
any
quantity
of
doctor
s
stuff
would
be
to
wring
the
neck
of
the
villain
who
put
my
eye
out
oh
i
shall
know
him
again
he
s
a
little
thin
palish
fellow
quite
thereupon
pierre
bethought
himself
of
the
blood
he
had
seen
on
silvere
s
hand
he
stepped
back
a
little
as
though
he
was
afraid
that
rengade
would
fly
at
his
throat
and
cry
it
was
your
nephew
who
blinded
me
and
you
will
have
to
pay
for
and
whilst
he
was
mentally
cursing
his
disreputable
family
he
solemnly
declared
that
if
the
guilty
person
were
found
he
should
be
punished
with
all
the
rigour
of
the
law
no
no
it
isn
t
worth
all
that
trouble
the
man
replied
i
ll
just
wring
his
neck
for
him
when
i
catch
rougon
hastened
back
to
the
the
afternoon
was
employed
in
taking
various
measures
the
proclamation
posted
up
about
one
o
clock
produced
an
excellent
impression
it
ended
by
an
appeal
to
the
good
sense
of
the
citizens
and
gave
a
firm
assurance
that
order
would
not
again
be
disturbed
until
dusk
in
fact
the
streets
presented
a
picture
of
general
relief
and
perfect
confidence
on
the
pavements
the
groups
who
were
reading
the
proclamation
exclaimed
it
s
all
finished
now
we
shall
soon
see
the
troops
who
have
been
sent
in
pursuit
of
the
this
belief
that
some
soldiers
were
approaching
was
so
general
that
the
idles
of
the
cours
sauvaire
repaired
to
the
nice
road
in
order
to
meet
and
hear
the
regimental
band
but
they
returned
at
nightfall
disappointed
having
seen
nothing
and
then
a
feeling
of
vague
alarm
began
to
disturb
the
townspeople
at
the
the
provisional
commission
had
talked
so
much
without
coming
to
any
decision
that
the
members
whose
stomachs
were
quite
empty
began
to
feel
alarmed
again
rougon
dismissed
them
to
dine
saying
that
they
would
meet
afresh
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
he
was
just
about
to
leave
the
room
himself
when
macquart
awoke
and
began
to
pommel
the
door
of
his
prison
he
declared
he
was
hungry
then
asked
what
time
it
was
and
when
his
brother
had
told
him
it
was
five
o
clock
he
feigned
great
astonishment
and
muttered
with
diabolical
malice
that
the
insurgents
had
promised
to
return
much
earlier
and
that
they
were
very
slow
in
coming
to
deliver
him
rougon
having
ordered
some
food
to
be
taken
to
him
went
downstairs
quite
worried
by
the
earnestness
with
which
the
rascal
spoke
of
the
return
of
the
insurgents
when
he
reached
the
street
his
disquietude
increased
the
town
seemed
to
him
quite
altered
it
was
assuming
a
strange
aspect
shadows
were
gliding
along
the
footpaths
which
were
growing
deserted
and
silent
while
gloomy
fear
seemed
like
fine
rain
to
be
slowly
persistently
falling
with
the
dusk
over
the
houses
the
babbling
confidence
of
the
daytime
was
fatally
terminating
in
groundless
panic
in
growing
alarm
as
the
night
drew
nearer
the
inhabitants
were
so
weary
and
so
satiated
with
their
triumph
that
they
had
no
strength
left
but
to
dream
of
some
terrible
retaliation
on
the
part
of
the
insurgents
rougon
shuddered
as
he
passed
through
this
current
of
terror
he
hastened
his
steps
feeling
as
if
he
would
choke
as
he
passed
a
cafe
on
the
place
des
recollets
where
the
lamps
had
just
been
lit
and
where
the
petty
cits
of
the
new
town
were
assembled
he
heard
a
few
words
of
terrifying
conversation
well
monsieur
picou
said
one
man
in
a
thick
voice
you
ve
heard
the
news
the
regiment
that
was
expected
has
not
but
nobody
expected
any
regiment
monsieur
touche
a
shrill
voice
replied
i
beg
your
pardon
you
haven
t
read
the
proclamation
then
oh
yes
it
s
true
the
placards
declare
that
order
will
be
maintained
by
force
if
you
see
then
there
s
force
mentioned
that
means
armed
forces
of
what
do
people
say
then
well
you
know
folks
are
beginning
to
feel
rather
frightened
they
say
that
this
delay
on
the
part
of
the
soldiers
isn
t
natural
and
that
the
insurgents
may
well
have
slaughtered
a
cry
of
horror
resounded
through
the
cafe
rougon
was
inclined
to
go
in
and
tell
those
bourgeois
that
the
proclamation
had
never
announced
the
arrival
of
a
regiment
that
they
had
no
right
to
strain
its
meaning
to
such
a
degree
nor
to
spread
such
foolish
theories
abroad
but
he
himself
amidst
the
disquietude
which
was
coming
over
him
was
not
quite
sure
he
had
not
counted
upon
a
despatch
of
troops
and
he
did
in
fact
consider
it
strange
that
not
a
single
soldier
had
made
his
appearance
so
he
reached
home
in
a
very
uneasy
state
of
mind
felicite
still
petulant
and
full
of
courage
became
quite
angry
at
seeing
him
upset
by
such
silly
trifles
over
the
dessert
she
comforted
him
well
you
great
simpleton
she
said
so
much
the
better
if
the
prefect
does
forget
us
we
shall
save
the
town
by
ourselves
for
my
part
i
should
like
to
see
the
insurgents
return
so
that
we
might
receive
them
with
bullets
and
cover
ourselves
with
glory
listen
to
me
go
and
have
the
gates
closed
and
don
t
go
to
bed
bustle
about
all
night
it
will
all
be
taken
into
account
later
pierre
returned
to
the
in
rather
more
cheerful
spirits
he
required
some
courage
to
remain
firm
amidst
the
woeful
maunderings
of
his
colleagues
the
members
of
the
provisional
commission
seemed
to
reek
with
panic
just
as
they
might
with
damp
in
the
rainy
season
they
all
professed
to
have
counted
upon
the
despatch
of
a
regiment
and
began
to
exclaim
that
brave
citizens
ought
not
to
be
abandoned
in
such
a
manner
to
the
fury
of
the
rabble
pierre
to
preserve
peace
almost
promised
they
should
have
a
regiment
on
the
morrow
then
he
announced
in
a
solemn
manner
that
he
was
going
to
have
the
gates
closed
this
came
as
a
relief
detachments
of
the
national
guards
had
to
repair
immediately
to
each
gate
and
it
when
they
had
returned
several
members
confessed
that
they
really
felt
more
comfortable
and
when
pierre
remarked
that
the
critical
situation
of
the
town
imposed
upon
them
the
duty
of
remaining
at
their
posts
some
of
them
made
arrangements
with
the
view
of
spending
the
night
in
an
granoux
put
on
a
black
silk
skull
cap
which
he
had
brought
with
him
by
way
of
precaution
towards
eleven
o
clock
half
of
the
gentlemen
were
sleeping
round
monsieur
garconnet
s
writing
table
those
who
still
managed
to
keep
their
eyes
open
fancied
as
they
listened
to
the
measured
tramp
of
the
national
guards
in
the
courtyard
that
they
were
heroes
and
were
receiving
decorations
a
large
lamp
placed
on
the
illumined
this
strange
vigil
all
at
once
however
rougon
who
had
seemed
to
be
slumbering
jumped
up
and
sent
for
vuillet
he
had
just
remembered
that
he
had
not
received
the
the
bookseller
made
his
appearance
in
a
very
bad
humour
well
rougon
asked
him
as
he
took
him
aside
what
about
the
article
you
promised
me
i
haven
t
seen
the
is
that
what
you
disturbed
me
for
vuillet
angrily
retorted
the
gazette
has
not
been
issued
i
ve
no
desire
to
get
myself
murdered
should
the
insurgents
come
rougon
tried
to
smile
as
he
declared
that
thank
heaven
nobody
would
be
murdered
at
all
it
was
precisely
because
false
and
disquieting
rumours
were
running
about
that
the
article
in
question
would
have
rendered
great
service
to
the
good
cause
possibly
vuillet
resumed
but
the
best
of
causes
at
the
present
time
is
to
keep
one
s
head
on
one
s
and
he
added
with
maliciousness
and
i
was
under
the
impression
you
had
killed
all
the
insurgents
you
ve
left
too
many
of
them
for
me
to
run
any
rougon
when
he
was
alone
again
felt
amazed
at
this
mutiny
on
the
part
of
a
man
who
was
usually
so
meek
and
mild
vuillet
s
conduct
seemed
to
him
suspicious
but
he
had
no
time
to
seek
an
explanation
he
had
scarcely
stretched
himself
out
afresh
in
his
when
roudier
entered
with
a
big
sabre
which
he
had
attached
to
his
belt
clattering
noisily
against
his
legs
the
sleepers
awoke
in
a
fright
granoux
thought
it
was
a
call
to
arms
eh
what
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
as
he
hastily
put
his
black
silk
cap
into
his
pocket
gentlemen
said
roudier
breathlessly
without
thinking
of
taking
any
oratorical
precautions
i
believe
that
a
band
of
insurgents
is
approaching
the
these
words
were
received
with
the
silence
of
terror
rougon
alone
had
the
strength
to
ask
have
you
seen
them
no
the
retired
hosier
replied
but
we
hear
strange
noises
out
in
the
country
one
of
my
men
assured
me
that
he
had
seen
fires
along
the
slope
of
the
then
as
all
the
gentlemen
stared
at
each
other
white
and
speechless
i
ll
return
to
my
post
he
continued
i
fear
an
attack
you
had
better
take
rougon
would
have
followed
him
to
obtain
further
particulars
but
he
was
already
too
far
away
after
this
the
commission
was
by
no
means
inclined
to
go
to
sleep
again
strange
noises
fires
an
attack
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
too
it
was
very
easy
to
talk
of
taking
precautions
but
what
were
they
to
do
granoux
was
very
near
advising
the
course
which
had
proved
so
successful
the
previous
evening
that
is
of
hiding
themselves
waiting
till
the
insurgents
has
passed
through
plassans
and
then
triumphing
in
the
deserted
streets
pierre
however
fortunately
remembering
his
wife
s
advice
said
that
roudier
might
have
made
a
mistake
and
that
the
best
thing
would
be
to
go
and
see
for
themselves
some
of
the
members
made
a
wry
face
at
this
suggestion
but
when
it
had
been
agreed
that
an
armed
escort
should
accompany
the
commission
they
all
descended
very
courageously
they
only
left
a
few
men
downstairs
they
surrounded
themselves
with
about
thirty
of
the
national
guards
and
then
they
ventured
into
the
slumbering
town
where
the
moon
creeping
over
the
house
roofs
slowly
cast
lengthened
shadows
they
went
along
the
ramparts
from
one
gate
to
the
other
seeing
nothing
and
hearing
nothing
the
national
guards
at
the
various
posts
certainly
told
them
that
peculiar
sounds
occasionally
reached
them
from
the
country
through
the
closed
gates
when
they
strained
their
ears
however
they
detected
nothing
but
a
distant
murmur
which
granoux
said
was
merely
the
noise
of
the
viorne
nevertheless
they
remained
doubtful
and
they
were
about
to
return
to
the
in
a
state
of
alarm
though
they
made
a
show
of
shrugging
their
shoulders
and
of
treating
roudier
as
a
poltroon
and
a
dreamer
when
rougon
anxious
to
reassure
them
thought
of
enabling
them
to
view
the
plain
over
a
distance
of
several
leagues
thereupon
he
led
the
little
company
to
the
quarter
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
valqueyras
mansion
at
the
very
outset
of
the
disturbances
count
de
valqueyras
had
left
for
his
chateau
at
corbiere
there
was
no
one
but
the
marquis
de
carnavant
at
the
plassans
house
he
since
the
previous
evening
had
prudently
kept
aloof
not
that
he
was
afraid
but
because
he
did
not
care
to
be
seen
plotting
with
the
rougons
at
the
critical
moment
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
burning
with
curiosity
he
had
been
compelled
to
shut
himself
up
in
order
to
resist
the
temptation
of
hastening
to
the
yellow
when
the
footman
came
to
tell
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
that
there
were
some
gentlemen
below
asking
for
him
he
could
not
hold
back
any
longer
he
got
up
and
went
downstairs
in
all
haste
my
dear
marquis
said
rougon
as
he
introduced
to
him
the
members
of
the
municipal
commission
we
want
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
will
you
allow
us
to
go
into
the
garden
of
the
mansion
by
all
means
replied
the
astonished
marquis
i
will
conduct
you
there
on
the
way
thither
he
ascertained
what
their
object
was
at
the
end
of
the
garden
rose
a
terrace
which
overlooked
the
plain
a
large
portion
of
the
ramparts
had
there
tumbled
in
leaving
a
boundless
prospect
to
the
view
it
had
occurred
to
rougon
that
this
would
serve
as
an
excellent
post
of
observation
while
conversing
together
the
members
of
the
commission
leaned
over
the
parapet
the
strange
spectacle
that
spread
out
before
them
soon
made
them
silent
in
the
distance
in
the
valley
of
the
viorne
across
the
vast
hollow
which
stretched
westward
between
the
chain
of
the
garrigues
and
the
mountains
of
the
seille
the
rays
of
the
moon
were
streaming
like
a
river
of
pale
light
the
clumps
of
trees
the
gloomy
rocks
looked
here
and
there
like
islets
and
tongues
of
land
emerging
from
a
luminous
sea
and
according
to
the
bends
of
the
viorne
one
could
now
and
again
distinguish
detached
portions
of
the
river
glittering
like
armour
amidst
the
fine
silvery
dust
falling
from
the
firmament
it
all
looked
like
an
ocean
a
world
magnified
by
the
darkness
the
cold
and
their
own
secret
fears
at
first
the
gentlemen
could
neither
hear
nor
see
anything
the
quiver
of
light
and
of
distant
sound
blinded
their
eyes
and
confused
their
ears
granoux
though
he
was
not
naturally
poetic
was
struck
by
the
calm
serenity
of
that
winter
night
and
murmured
what
a
beautiful
night
gentlemen
roudier
was
certainly
dreaming
exclaimed
rougon
rather
disdainfully
but
the
marquis
whose
ears
were
quick
had
begun
to
listen
ah
he
observed
in
his
clear
voice
i
hear
the
at
this
they
all
leant
over
the
parapet
holding
their
breath
and
light
and
pure
as
crystal
the
distant
tolling
of
a
bell
rose
from
the
plain
the
gentlemen
could
not
deny
it
it
was
indeed
the
tocsin
rougon
pretended
that
he
recognised
the
bell
of
beage
a
village
fully
a
league
from
plassans
this
he
said
in
order
to
reassure
his
colleagues
but
the
marquis
interrupted
him
listen
listen
this
time
it
is
the
bell
of
and
he
indicated
another
point
of
the
horizon
to
them
there
was
in
fact
a
second
bell
wailing
through
the
clear
night
and
very
soon
there
were
ten
bells
twenty
bells
whose
despairing
tollings
were
detected
by
their
ears
which
had
by
this
time
grown
accustomed
to
the
quivering
of
the
darkness
ominous
calls
rose
from
all
sides
like
the
faint
rattles
of
dying
men
soon
the
whole
plain
seemed
to
be
wailing
the
gentlemen
no
longer
jeered
at
roudier
particularly
as
the
marquis
who
took
a
malicious
delight
in
terrifying
them
was
kind
enough
to
explain
the
cause
of
all
this
it
is
the
neighbouring
villages
he
said
to
rougon
banding
together
to
attack
plassans
at
at
this
granoux
opened
his
eyes
wide
didn
t
you
see
something
just
this
moment
over
there
he
asked
all
of
a
sudden
nobody
had
looked
the
gentlemen
had
been
keeping
their
eyes
closed
in
order
to
hear
the
better
ah
look
he
resumed
after
a
short
pause
there
beyond
the
viorne
near
that
black
yes
i
see
replied
rougon
in
despair
it
s
a
fire
they
re
a
moment
later
another
fire
appeared
almost
immediately
in
front
of
the
first
one
then
a
third
and
a
fourth
in
this
wise
red
splotches
appeared
at
nearly
equal
distances
throughout
the
whole
length
of
the
valley
resembling
the
lamps
of
some
gigantic
avenue
the
moonlight
which
dimmed
their
radiance
made
them
look
like
pools
of
blood
this
melancholy
illumination
gave
a
finishing
touch
to
the
consternation
of
the
municipal
commission
of
course
the
marquis
muttered
with
his
bitterest
sneer
those
brigands
are
signalling
to
each
and
he
counted
the
fires
complacently
to
get
some
idea
he
said
as
to
how
many
men
the
brave
national
guard
of
plassans
would
have
to
deal
with
rougon
endeavoured
to
raise
doubts
by
saying
the
villages
were
taking
up
arms
in
order
to
join
the
army
of
the
insurgents
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
the
town
but
the
gentlemen
by
their
silent
consternation
made
it
clear
that
they
had
formed
their
own
opinion
and
were
not
to
be
consoled
i
can
hear
the
marseillaise
now
remarked
granoux
in
a
hushed
voice
it
was
indeed
true
a
detachment
must
have
been
following
the
course
of
the
viorne
passing
at
that
moment
just
under
the
town
the
cry
to
arms
citizens
form
your
battalions
reached
the
in
sudden
bursts
with
vibrating
distinctness
ah
what
an
awful
night
it
was
the
gentlemen
spent
it
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
terrace
numbed
by
the
terrible
cold
and
yet
quite
unable
to
tear
themselves
away
from
the
sight
of
that
plain
which
resounded
with
the
tocsin
and
the
marseillaise
and
was
all
ablaze
with
they
feasted
their
eyes
upon
that
sea
of
light
flecked
with
flames
and
they
strained
their
ears
in
order
to
listen
to
the
confused
clamour
till
at
last
their
senses
began
to
deceive
them
and
they
saw
and
heard
the
most
frightful
things
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
induced
them
to
leave
the
spot
if
they
had
turned
their
backs
they
would
have
fancied
that
a
whole
army
was
at
their
heels
after
the
manner
of
a
certain
class
of
cowards
they
wished
to
witness
the
approach
of
the
danger
in
order
that
they
might
take
flight
at
the
right
moment
towards
morning
when
the
moon
had
set
and
they
could
see
nothing
in
front
of
them
but
a
dark
void
they
fell
into
a
terrible
fright
they
fancied
they
were
surrounded
by
invisible
enemies
who
were
crawling
along
in
the
darkness
ready
to
fly
at
their
throats
at
the
slightest
noise
they
imagined
there
were
enemies
deliberating
beneath
the
terrace
prior
to
scaling
it
yet
there
was
nothing
nothing
but
darkness
upon
which
they
fixed
their
eyes
distractedly
the
marquis
as
if
to
console
them
said
in
his
ironical
way
don
t
be
uneasy
they
will
certainly
wait
till
meanwhile
rougon
cursed
and
swore
he
felt
himself
again
giving
way
to
fear
as
for
granoux
his
hair
turned
completely
white
at
last
the
dawn
appeared
with
weary
slowness
this
again
was
a
terribly
anxious
moment
the
gentlemen
at
the
first
ray
of
light
expected
to
see
an
army
drawn
up
in
line
before
the
town
it
so
happened
that
day
that
the
dawn
was
lazy
and
lingered
awhile
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
with
outstretched
necks
and
fixed
gaze
the
party
on
the
terrace
peered
anxiously
into
the
misty
expanse
in
the
uncertain
light
they
fancied
they
caught
glimpses
of
colossal
profiles
the
plain
seemed
to
be
transformed
into
a
lake
of
blood
the
rocks
looked
like
corpses
floating
on
its
surface
and
the
clusters
of
trees
took
the
forms
of
battalions
drawn
up
and
threatening
attack
when
the
growing
light
had
at
last
dispersed
these
phantoms
the
morning
broke
so
pale
so
mournful
so
melancholy
that
even
the
marquis
s
spirits
sank
not
a
single
insurgent
was
to
be
seen
and
the
high
roads
were
free
but
the
grey
valley
wore
a
gruesomely
sad
and
deserted
aspect
the
fires
had
now
gone
out
but
the
bells
still
rang
on
towards
eight
o
clock
rougon
observed
a
small
party
of
men
who
were
moving
off
along
the
viorne
by
this
time
the
gentlemen
were
half
dead
with
cold
and
fatigue
seeing
no
immediate
danger
they
determined
to
take
a
few
hours
rest
a
national
guard
was
left
on
the
terrace
as
a
sentinel
with
orders
to
run
and
inform
roudier
if
he
should
perceive
any
band
approaching
in
the
distance
then
granoux
and
rougon
quite
worn
out
by
the
emotions
of
the
night
repaired
to
their
homes
which
were
close
together
and
supported
each
other
on
the
way
felicite
put
her
husband
to
bed
with
every
care
she
called
him
poor
dear
and
repeatedly
told
him
that
he
ought
not
to
give
way
to
evil
fancies
and
that
all
would
end
well
but
he
shook
his
head
he
felt
grave
apprehensions
she
let
him
sleep
till
eleven
o
clock
then
after
he
had
had
something
to
eat
she
gently
turned
him
out
of
doors
making
him
understand
that
he
must
go
through
with
the
matter
to
the
end
at
the
rougon
found
only
four
members
of
the
commission
in
attendance
the
others
had
sent
excuses
they
were
really
panic
had
been
sweeping
through
the
town
with
growing
violence
all
through
the
morning
the
gentlemen
had
not
been
able
to
keep
quiet
respecting
the
memorable
night
they
had
spent
on
the
terrace
of
the
valqueyras
mansion
their
servants
had
hastened
to
spread
the
news
embellishing
it
with
various
dramatic
details
by
this
time
it
had
already
become
a
matter
of
history
that
from
the
heights
of
plassans
troops
of
cannibals
had
been
seen
dancing
and
devouring
their
prisoners
yes
bands
of
witches
had
circled
hand
in
hand
round
their
caldrons
in
which
they
were
boiling
children
while
on
and
on
marched
endless
files
of
bandits
whose
weapons
glittered
in
the
moonlight
people
spoke
too
of
bells
that
of
their
own
accord
sent
the
tocsin
ringing
through
the
desolate
air
and
it
was
even
asserted
that
the
insurgents
had
fired
the
neighbouring
forests
so
that
the
whole
country
side
was
in
flames
it
was
tuesday
the
at
plassans
and
roudier
had
thought
it
necessary
to
have
the
gates
opened
in
order
to
admit
the
few
peasants
who
had
brought
vegetables
butter
and
eggs
as
soon
as
it
had
assembled
the
municipal
commission
now
composed
of
five
members
only
including
its
president
declared
that
this
was
unpardonable
imprudence
although
the
sentinel
stationed
at
the
valqueyras
mansion
had
seen
nothing
the
town
ought
to
have
been
kept
closed
then
rougon
decided
that
the
public
crier
accompanied
by
a
drummer
should
go
through
the
streets
proclaim
a
state
of
siege
and
announce
to
the
inhabitants
that
whoever
might
go
out
would
not
be
allowed
to
return
the
gates
were
officially
closed
in
broad
daylight
this
measure
adopted
in
order
to
reassure
the
inhabitants
raised
the
scare
to
its
highest
pitch
and
there
could
scarcely
have
been
a
more
curious
sight
than
that
of
this
little
city
thus
padlocking
and
bolting
itself
up
beneath
the
bright
sunshine
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
when
plassans
had
buckled
and
tightened
its
belt
of
dilapidated
ramparts
when
it
had
bolted
itself
in
like
a
besieged
fortress
at
the
approach
of
an
assault
the
most
terrible
anguish
passed
over
the
mournful
houses
at
every
moment
in
the
centre
of
the
town
people
fancied
they
could
hear
a
discharge
of
musketry
in
the
faubourgs
they
no
longer
received
any
news
they
were
so
to
say
at
the
bottom
of
a
cellar
in
a
walled
hole
where
they
were
anxiously
awaiting
either
deliverance
or
the
finishing
stroke
for
the
last
two
days
the
insurgents
who
were
scouring
the
country
had
cut
off
all
communication
plassans
found
itself
isolated
from
the
rest
of
france
it
felt
that
it
was
surrounded
by
a
region
in
open
rebellion
where
the
tocsin
was
ever
ringing
and
the
marseillaise
was
ever
roaring
like
a
river
that
has
overflowed
its
banks
abandoned
to
its
fate
and
shuddering
with
alarm
the
town
lay
there
like
some
prey
which
would
prove
the
reward
of
the
victorious
party
the
strollers
on
the
cours
sauvaire
were
ever
swaying
between
fear
and
hope
according
as
they
fancied
that
they
could
see
the
blouses
of
insurgents
or
the
uniforms
of
soldiers
at
the
grand
never
had
pent
within
walls
endured
more
agonising
torture
towards
two
o
clock
it
was
rumoured
that
the
coup
d
etat
had
failed
that
the
was
imprisoned
at
vincennes
and
that
paris
was
in
the
hands
of
the
most
advanced
demagogues
it
was
reported
also
that
marseilles
toulon
draguignan
the
entire
south
belonged
to
the
victorious
insurrectionary
army
the
insurgents
would
arrive
in
the
evening
and
put
plassans
to
the
sword
thereupon
a
deputation
repaired
to
the
to
expostulate
with
the
municipal
commission
for
closing
the
gates
whereby
they
would
only
irritate
the
insurgents
rougon
who
was
losing
his
head
defended
his
order
with
all
his
remaining
strength
this
locking
of
the
gates
seemed
to
him
one
of
the
most
ingenious
acts
of
his
administration
he
advanced
the
most
convincing
arguments
in
its
justification
but
the
others
embarrassed
him
by
their
questions
asking
him
where
were
the
soldiers
the
regiment
that
he
had
promised
then
he
began
to
lie
and
told
them
flatly
that
he
had
promised
nothing
at
all
the
of
this
legendary
regiment
which
the
inhabitants
longed
for
with
such
eagerness
that
they
had
actually
dreamt
of
its
arrival
was
the
chief
cause
of
the
panic
people
even
named
the
exact
spot
on
the
high
road
where
the
soldiers
had
been
butchered
at
four
o
clock
rougon
followed
by
granoux
again
repaired
to
the
valqueyras
mansion
small
bands
on
their
way
to
join
the
insurgents
at
orcheres
still
passed
along
in
the
distance
through
the
valley
of
the
viorne
throughout
the
day
urchins
climbed
the
ramparts
and
bourgeois
came
to
peep
through
the
loopholes
these
volunteer
sentinels
kept
up
the
terror
by
counting
the
various
bands
which
were
taken
for
so
many
strong
battalions
the
timorous
population
fancied
it
could
see
from
the
battlements
the
preparations
for
some
universal
massacre
at
dusk
as
on
the
previous
evening
the
panic
became
yet
more
chilling
on
returning
to
the
municipal
offices
rougon
and
his
inseparable
companion
granoux
recognised
that
the
situation
was
growing
intolerable
during
their
absence
another
member
of
the
commission
had
disappeared
they
were
only
four
now
and
they
felt
they
were
making
themselves
ridiculous
by
staying
there
for
hours
looking
at
each
other
s
pale
countenances
and
never
saying
a
word
moreover
they
were
terribly
afraid
of
having
to
spend
a
second
night
on
the
terrace
of
the
valqueyras
mansion
rougon
gravely
declared
that
as
the
situation
of
affairs
was
unchanged
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
continue
to
remain
there
if
anything
serious
should
occur
information
would
be
sent
to
them
and
by
a
decision
duly
taken
in
council
he
deputed
to
roudier
the
carrying
on
of
the
administration
poor
roudier
who
remembered
that
he
had
served
as
a
national
guard
in
paris
under
was
meantime
conscientiously
keeping
watch
at
the
grand
rougon
went
home
looking
very
downcast
and
creeping
along
under
the
shadows
of
the
houses
he
felt
that
plassans
was
becoming
hostile
to
him
he
heard
his
name
bandied
about
amongst
the
groups
with
expressions
of
anger
and
contempt
he
walked
upstairs
reeling
and
perspiring
felicite
received
him
with
speechless
consternation
she
also
was
beginning
to
despair
their
dreams
were
being
completely
shattered
they
stood
silent
face
to
face
in
the
yellow
the
day
was
drawing
to
a
close
a
murky
winter
day
which
imparted
a
muddy
tint
to
the
with
its
large
flower
pattern
never
had
the
room
looked
more
faded
more
mean
more
shabby
and
at
this
hour
they
were
alone
they
no
longer
had
a
crowd
of
courtiers
congratulating
them
as
on
the
previous
evening
a
single
day
had
sufficed
to
topple
them
over
at
the
very
moment
when
they
were
singing
victory
if
the
situation
did
not
change
on
the
morrow
their
game
would
be
lost
felicite
who
when
gazing
on
the
previous
evening
at
the
ruins
of
the
yellow
had
thought
of
the
plains
of
austerlitz
now
recalled
the
accursed
field
of
waterloo
as
she
observed
how
mournful
and
deserted
the
place
was
then
as
her
husband
said
nothing
she
mechanically
went
to
the
window
that
window
where
she
had
inhaled
with
delight
the
incense
of
the
entire
town
she
perceived
numerous
groups
below
on
the
square
but
she
closed
the
blinds
upon
seeing
some
heads
turn
towards
their
house
for
she
feared
that
she
might
be
hooted
she
felt
quite
sure
that
those
people
were
speaking
about
them
indeed
voices
rose
through
the
twilight
a
lawyer
was
clamouring
in
the
tone
of
a
triumphant
pleader
that
s
just
what
i
said
the
insurgents
left
of
their
own
accord
and
they
won
t
ask
the
permission
of
the
to
come
back
the
indeed
a
fine
farce
why
i
believe
there
were
at
least
two
no
indeed
said
a
burly
trader
an
and
a
great
politician
there
were
probably
not
even
ten
there
was
no
fighting
or
else
we
should
have
seen
some
blood
in
the
morning
i
went
to
the
myself
to
look
the
courtyard
was
as
clean
as
my
then
a
workman
who
stepped
timidly
up
to
the
group
added
there
was
no
need
of
any
violence
to
seize
the
building
the
door
wasn
t
even
this
remark
was
received
with
laughter
and
the
workman
thus
encouraged
continued
as
for
those
rougons
everybody
knows
that
they
are
a
bad
this
insult
pierced
felicite
to
the
heart
the
ingratitude
of
the
people
was
heartrending
to
her
for
she
herself
was
at
last
beginning
to
believe
in
the
mission
of
the
rougons
she
called
for
her
husband
she
wanted
him
to
learn
how
fickle
was
the
multitude
it
s
all
a
piece
with
their
mirror
continued
the
lawyer
what
a
fuss
they
made
about
that
broken
glass
you
know
that
rougon
is
quite
capable
of
having
fired
his
gun
at
it
just
to
make
believe
there
had
been
a
pierre
restrained
a
cry
of
pain
what
they
did
not
even
believe
in
his
mirror
now
they
would
soon
assert
that
he
had
not
heard
a
bullet
whiz
past
his
ear
the
legend
of
the
rougons
would
be
blotted
out
nothing
would
remain
of
their
glory
but
his
torture
was
not
at
an
end
yet
the
groups
manifested
their
hostility
as
heartily
as
they
had
displayed
their
approval
on
the
previous
evening
a
retired
hatter
an
old
man
seventy
years
of
age
whose
factory
had
formerly
been
in
the
faubourg
ferreted
out
the
rougons
past
history
he
spoke
vaguely
with
the
hesitation
of
a
wandering
memory
about
the
fouques
property
and
adelaide
and
her
amours
with
a
smuggler
he
said
just
enough
to
give
a
fresh
start
to
the
gossip
the
tattlers
drew
closer
together
and
such
words
as
rogues
thieves
and
shameless
intriguers
ascended
to
the
shutter
behind
which
pierre
and
felicite
were
perspiring
with
fear
and
indignation
the
people
on
the
square
even
went
so
far
as
to
pity
macquart
this
was
the
final
blow
on
the
previous
day
rougon
had
been
a
brutus
a
stoic
soul
sacrificing
his
own
affections
to
his
country
now
he
was
nothing
but
an
ambitious
villain
who
felled
his
brother
to
the
ground
and
made
use
of
him
as
a
to
fortune
you
hear
you
hear
them
pierre
murmured
in
a
stifled
voice
ah
the
scoundrels
they
are
killing
us
we
shall
never
retrieve
felicite
enraged
was
beating
a
tattoo
on
the
shutter
with
her
impatient
fingers
let
them
talk
she
answered
if
we
get
the
upper
hand
again
they
shall
see
what
stuff
i
m
made
of
i
know
where
the
blow
comes
from
the
new
town
hates
she
guessed
rightly
the
sudden
unpopularity
of
the
rougons
was
the
work
of
a
group
of
lawyers
who
were
very
much
annoyed
at
the
importance
acquired
by
an
old
illiterate
whose
house
had
been
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
the
quarter
had
shown
no
sign
of
life
for
the
last
two
days
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
quarter
and
the
new
town
alone
remained
in
presence
and
the
latter
had
taken
advantage
of
the
panic
to
injure
the
yellow
in
the
minds
of
the
tradespeople
and
roudier
and
granoux
were
said
to
be
excellent
men
honourable
citizens
who
had
been
led
away
by
the
rougons
intrigues
their
eyes
ought
to
be
opened
to
it
ought
not
monsieur
isidore
granoux
to
be
seated
in
the
mayor
s
in
the
place
of
that
big
portly
beggar
who
had
not
a
copper
to
bless
himself
with
thus
launched
the
envious
folks
began
to
reproach
rougon
for
all
the
acts
of
his
administration
which
only
dated
from
the
previous
evening
he
had
no
right
to
retain
the
services
of
the
former
municipal
council
he
had
been
guilty
of
grave
folly
in
ordering
the
gates
to
be
closed
it
was
through
his
stupidity
that
five
members
of
the
commission
had
contracted
inflammation
of
the
lungs
on
the
terrace
of
the
valqueyras
mansion
there
was
no
end
to
his
faults
the
republicans
likewise
raised
their
heads
they
talked
of
the
possibility
of
a
sudden
attack
upon
the
by
the
workmen
of
the
faubourg
the
reaction
was
at
its
last
gasp
pierre
at
this
overthrow
of
all
his
hopes
began
to
wonder
what
support
he
might
still
rely
on
if
occasion
should
require
any
wasn
t
aristide
to
come
here
this
evening
he
asked
to
make
it
up
with
us
yes
answered
felicite
he
promised
me
a
good
article
the
independant
has
not
appeared
yet
but
her
husband
interrupted
her
crying
see
isn
t
that
he
who
is
just
coming
out
of
the
the
old
woman
glanced
in
that
direction
he
s
got
his
arm
in
a
sling
again
she
cried
aristide
s
hand
was
indeed
wrapped
in
the
silk
handkerchief
once
more
the
empire
was
breaking
up
but
the
republic
was
not
yet
triumphant
and
he
had
judged
it
prudent
to
resume
the
part
of
a
disabled
man
he
crossed
the
square
stealthily
without
raising
his
head
then
doubtless
hearing
some
dangerous
and
compromising
remarks
among
the
groups
of
bystanders
he
made
all
haste
to
turn
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
banne
bah
he
won
t
come
here
said
felicite
bitterly
it
s
all
up
with
us
even
our
children
forsake
us
she
shut
the
window
violently
in
order
that
she
might
not
see
or
hear
anything
more
when
she
had
lit
the
lamp
she
and
her
husband
sat
down
to
dinner
disheartened
and
without
appetite
leaving
most
of
their
food
on
their
plates
they
only
had
a
few
hours
left
them
to
take
a
decisive
step
it
was
absolutely
indispensable
that
before
daybreak
plassans
should
be
at
their
feet
beseeching
forgiveness
or
else
they
must
entirely
renounce
the
fortune
which
they
had
dreamed
of
the
total
absence
of
any
reliable
news
was
the
sole
cause
of
their
anxious
indecision
felicite
with
her
clear
intellect
had
quickly
perceived
this
if
they
had
been
able
to
learn
the
result
of
the
coup
d
etat
they
would
either
have
faced
it
out
and
have
still
pursued
their
role
of
deliverers
or
else
have
done
what
they
could
to
efface
all
recollection
of
their
unlucky
campaign
but
they
had
no
precise
information
they
were
losing
their
heads
the
thought
that
they
were
thus
risking
their
fortune
on
a
throw
in
complete
ignorance
of
what
was
happening
brought
a
cold
perspiration
to
their
brows
and
why
the
devil
doesn
t
eugene
write
to
me
rougon
suddenly
cried
in
an
outburst
of
despair
forgetting
that
he
was
betraying
the
secret
of
his
correspondence
to
his
wife
but
felicite
pretended
not
to
have
heard
her
husband
s
exclamation
had
profoundly
affected
her
why
indeed
did
not
eugene
write
to
his
father
after
keeping
him
so
accurately
informed
of
the
progress
of
the
bonapartist
cause
he
ought
at
least
to
have
announced
the
triumph
or
defeat
of
prince
louis
mere
prudence
would
have
counselled
the
despatch
of
such
information
if
he
remained
silent
it
must
be
that
the
victorious
republic
had
sent
him
to
join
the
pretender
in
the
dungeons
of
vincennes
at
this
thought
felicite
felt
chilled
to
the
marrow
her
son
s
silence
destroyed
her
last
hopes
at
that
moment
somebody
brought
up
the
gazette
which
had
only
just
appeared
ah
said
pierre
with
surprise
vuillet
has
issued
his
paper
thereupon
he
tore
off
the
wrapper
read
the
leading
article
and
finished
it
looking
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
swaying
on
his
chair
here
read
he
resumed
handing
the
paper
to
felicite
it
was
a
magnificent
article
attacking
the
insurgents
with
unheard
of
violence
never
had
so
much
stinging
bitterness
so
many
falsehoods
such
bigoted
abuse
flowed
from
pen
before
vuillet
commenced
by
narrating
the
entry
of
the
insurgents
into
plassans
the
description
was
a
perfect
masterpiece
he
spoke
of
those
bandits
those
countenances
that
scum
of
the
galleys
invading
the
town
intoxicated
with
brandy
lust
and
then
he
exhibited
them
parading
their
cynicism
in
the
streets
terrifying
the
inhabitants
with
their
savage
cries
and
seeking
only
violence
and
further
on
the
scene
at
the
and
the
arrest
of
the
authorities
became
a
most
horrible
drama
then
they
seized
the
most
respectable
people
by
the
throat
and
the
mayor
the
brave
commander
of
the
national
guard
the
postmaster
that
kindly
functionary
were
even
like
the
divinity
crowned
with
thorns
by
those
wretches
who
spat
in
their
the
passage
devoted
to
miette
and
her
red
pelisse
was
quite
a
flight
of
imagination
vuillet
had
seen
ten
twenty
girls
steeped
in
blood
and
who
he
wrote
did
not
behold
among
those
monsters
some
infamous
creatures
clothed
in
red
who
must
have
bathed
themselves
in
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
murdered
by
the
brigands
along
the
high
roads
they
were
brandishing
banners
and
openly
receiving
the
vile
caresses
of
the
entire
and
vuillet
added
with
biblical
magniloquence
the
republic
ever
marches
on
amidst
debauchery
and
that
however
was
only
the
first
part
of
the
article
the
narrative
being
ended
the
editor
asked
if
the
country
would
any
longer
tolerate
the
shamelessness
of
those
wild
beasts
who
respected
neither
property
nor
he
made
an
appeal
to
all
valorous
citizens
declaring
that
to
tolerate
such
things
any
longer
would
be
to
encourage
them
and
that
the
insurgents
would
then
come
and
snatch
the
daughter
from
her
mother
s
arms
the
wife
from
her
husband
s
and
at
last
after
a
pious
sentence
in
which
he
declared
that
heaven
willed
the
extermination
of
the
wicked
he
concluded
with
this
trumpet
blast
it
is
asserted
that
these
wretches
are
once
more
at
our
gates
well
then
let
each
one
of
us
take
a
gun
and
shoot
them
down
like
dogs
i
for
my
part
shall
be
seen
in
the
front
rank
happy
to
rid
the
earth
of
such
this
article
in
which
periphrastic
abuse
was
strung
together
with
all
the
heaviness
of
touch
which
characterises
french
provincial
journalism
quite
terrified
rougon
who
muttered
as
felicite
replaced
the
gazette
on
the
table
ah
the
wretch
he
is
giving
us
the
last
blow
people
will
believe
that
i
inspired
this
but
his
wife
remarked
pensively
did
you
not
this
morning
tell
me
that
he
absolutely
refused
to
write
against
the
republicans
the
news
that
circulated
had
terrified
him
and
he
was
as
pale
as
death
you
yes
yes
i
can
t
understand
it
at
all
when
i
insisted
he
went
so
far
as
to
reproach
me
for
not
having
killed
all
the
insurgents
it
was
yesterday
that
he
ought
to
have
written
that
article
he
ll
get
us
all
butchered
felicite
was
lost
in
amazement
what
could
have
prompted
vuillet
s
change
of
front
the
idea
of
that
wretched
carrying
a
musket
and
firing
on
the
ramparts
of
plassans
seemed
to
her
one
of
the
most
ridiculous
things
imaginable
there
was
certainly
some
determining
cause
underlying
all
this
which
escaped
her
only
one
thing
seemed
certain
vuillet
was
too
impudent
in
his
abuse
and
too
ready
with
his
valour
for
the
insurrectionary
band
to
be
really
so
near
the
town
as
some
people
asserted
he
s
a
spiteful
fellow
i
always
said
so
rougon
resumed
after
reading
the
article
again
he
has
only
been
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
do
us
this
injury
what
a
fool
i
was
to
leave
him
in
charge
of
the
this
last
sentence
proved
a
flash
of
light
felicite
started
up
quickly
as
though
at
some
sudden
thought
then
she
put
on
a
cap
and
threw
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
where
are
you
going
pray
her
husband
asked
her
with
surprise
it
s
past
nine
o
you
go
to
bed
she
replied
rather
brusquely
you
re
not
well
go
and
rest
yourself
sleep
on
till
i
come
back
i
ll
wake
you
if
necessary
and
then
we
can
talk
the
matter
she
went
out
with
her
usual
nimble
gait
ran
to
the
and
abruptly
entered
the
room
where
vuillet
was
still
at
work
on
seeing
her
he
made
a
hasty
gesture
of
vexation
never
in
his
life
had
vuillet
felt
so
happy
since
he
had
been
able
to
slip
his
little
fingers
into
the
he
had
enjoyed
the
most
exquisite
pleasure
the
pleasure
of
an
inquisitive
priest
about
to
relish
the
confessions
of
his
penitents
all
the
sly
blabbing
all
the
vague
chatter
of
sacristies
resounded
in
his
ears
he
poked
his
long
pale
nose
into
the
letters
gazed
amorously
at
the
superscriptions
with
his
suspicious
eyes
sounded
the
envelopes
just
like
little
abbes
sound
the
souls
of
maidens
he
experienced
endless
enjoyment
was
titillated
by
the
most
enticing
temptation
the
thousand
secrets
of
plassans
lay
there
he
held
in
his
hand
the
honour
of
women
the
fortunes
of
men
and
had
only
to
break
a
seal
to
know
as
much
as
the
grand
vicar
at
the
cathedral
who
was
the
confidant
of
all
the
better
people
of
the
town
vuillet
was
one
of
those
terribly
bitter
frigid
gossips
who
worm
out
everything
but
never
repeat
what
they
hear
except
by
way
of
dealing
somebody
a
mortal
blow
he
had
consequently
often
longed
to
dip
his
arms
into
the
public
since
the
previous
evening
the
private
room
at
the
had
become
a
big
confessional
full
of
darkness
and
mystery
in
which
he
tasted
exquisite
rapture
while
sniffing
at
the
letters
which
exhaled
veiled
longings
and
quivering
avowals
moreover
he
carried
on
his
work
with
consummate
impudence
the
crisis
through
which
the
country
was
passing
secured
him
perfect
impunity
if
some
letters
should
be
delayed
or
others
should
miscarry
altogether
it
would
be
the
fault
of
those
villainous
republicans
who
were
scouring
the
country
and
interrupting
all
communication
the
closing
of
the
town
gates
had
for
a
moment
vexed
him
but
he
had
come
to
an
understanding
with
roudier
whereby
the
couriers
were
allowed
to
enter
and
bring
the
mails
direct
to
him
without
passing
by
the
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
only
opened
a
few
letters
the
important
ones
those
in
which
his
keen
scent
divined
some
information
which
it
would
be
useful
for
him
to
know
before
anybody
else
then
he
contented
himself
by
locking
up
in
a
drawer
for
delivery
subsequently
such
letters
as
might
give
information
and
rob
him
of
the
merit
of
his
valour
at
a
time
when
the
whole
town
was
trembling
with
fear
this
pious
personage
in
selecting
the
management
of
the
as
his
own
share
of
the
spoils
had
given
proof
of
singular
insight
into
the
situation
when
madame
rougon
entered
he
was
taking
his
choice
of
a
heap
of
letters
and
papers
under
the
pretext
no
doubt
of
classifying
them
he
rose
with
his
humble
smile
and
offered
her
a
seat
his
reddened
eyelids
blinking
rather
uneasily
but
felicite
did
not
sit
down
she
roughly
exclaimed
i
want
the
at
this
vuillet
s
eyes
opened
widely
with
an
expression
of
perfect
innocence
what
letter
madame
he
asked
the
letter
you
received
this
morning
for
my
husband
come
monsieur
vuillet
i
m
in
a
and
as
he
stammered
that
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
not
seen
anything
that
it
was
very
strange
felicite
continued
in
a
covertly
threatening
voice
a
letter
from
paris
from
my
son
eugene
you
know
what
i
mean
don
t
you
i
ll
look
for
it
thereupon
she
stepped
forward
as
if
intending
to
examine
the
various
packets
which
littered
the
writing
table
but
he
at
once
bestirred
himself
and
said
he
would
go
and
see
the
service
was
necessarily
in
great
confusion
perhaps
indeed
there
might
be
a
letter
in
that
case
they
would
find
it
but
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
swore
he
had
not
seen
any
while
he
was
speaking
he
moved
about
the
office
turning
over
all
the
papers
then
he
opened
the
drawers
and
the
portfolios
felicite
waited
quite
calm
and
collected
yes
indeed
you
re
right
here
s
a
letter
for
you
he
cried
at
last
as
he
took
a
few
papers
from
a
portfolio
ah
those
confounded
clerks
they
take
advantage
of
the
situation
to
do
nothing
in
the
proper
felicite
took
the
letter
and
examined
the
seal
attentively
apparently
quite
regardless
of
the
fact
that
such
scrutiny
might
wound
vuillet
s
susceptibilities
she
clearly
perceived
that
the
envelope
must
have
been
opened
the
bookseller
in
his
unskilful
way
had
used
some
sealing
wax
of
a
darker
colour
to
secure
it
again
she
took
care
to
open
the
envelope
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preserve
the
seal
intact
so
that
it
might
serve
as
proof
of
this
then
she
read
the
note
eugene
briefly
announced
the
complete
success
of
the
coup
d
etat
paris
was
subdued
the
provinces
generally
speaking
remained
quiet
and
he
counselled
his
parents
to
maintain
a
very
firm
attitude
in
face
of
the
partial
insurrection
which
was
disturbing
the
south
in
conclusion
he
told
them
that
the
foundation
of
their
fortune
was
laid
if
they
did
not
weaken
madame
rougon
put
the
letter
in
her
pocket
and
sat
down
slowly
looking
into
vuillet
s
face
the
latter
had
resumed
his
sorting
in
a
feverish
manner
as
though
he
were
very
busy
listen
to
me
monsieur
vuillet
she
said
to
him
and
when
he
raised
his
head
let
us
play
our
cards
openly
you
do
wrong
to
betray
us
some
misfortune
may
befall
you
if
instead
of
unsealing
our
letters
at
this
he
protested
and
feigned
great
indignation
but
she
calmly
continued
i
know
i
know
your
school
you
never
confess
come
don
t
let
us
waste
any
more
words
what
interest
have
you
in
favouring
the
coup
d
etat
and
as
he
continued
to
assert
his
perfect
honesty
she
at
last
lost
patience
you
take
me
for
a
fool
she
cried
i
ve
read
your
article
you
would
do
much
better
to
act
in
concert
with
thereupon
without
avowing
anything
he
flatly
submitted
that
he
wished
to
have
the
custom
of
the
college
formerly
it
was
he
who
had
supplied
that
establishment
with
school
books
but
it
had
become
known
that
he
sold
objectionable
literature
clandestinely
to
the
pupils
for
which
reason
indeed
he
had
almost
been
prosecuted
at
the
correctional
police
court
since
then
he
had
jealously
longed
to
be
received
back
into
the
good
graces
of
the
directors
felicite
was
surprised
at
the
modesty
of
his
ambition
and
told
him
so
to
open
letters
and
risk
the
galleys
just
for
the
sake
of
selling
a
few
dictionaries
and
grammars
eh
he
exclaimed
in
a
shrill
voice
it
s
an
assured
sale
of
four
or
five
thousand
francs
a
year
i
don
t
aspire
to
impossibilities
like
some
she
did
not
take
any
notice
of
his
last
taunting
words
no
more
was
said
about
his
opening
the
letters
a
treaty
of
alliance
was
concluded
by
which
vuillet
engaged
that
he
would
not
circulate
any
news
or
take
any
step
in
advance
on
condition
that
the
rougons
should
secure
him
the
custom
of
the
college
as
she
was
leaving
felicite
advised
him
not
to
compromise
himself
any
further
it
would
be
sufficient
for
him
to
detain
the
letters
and
distribute
them
only
on
the
second
day
what
a
knave
she
muttered
when
she
reached
the
street
forgetting
that
she
herself
had
just
laid
an
interdict
upon
the
mail
she
went
home
slowly
wrapped
in
thought
she
even
went
out
of
her
way
passing
along
the
cours
sauvaire
as
if
to
gain
time
and
ease
for
reflection
before
going
in
under
the
trees
of
the
promenade
she
met
monsieur
de
carnavant
who
was
taking
advantage
of
the
darkness
to
ferret
about
the
town
without
compromising
himself
the
clergy
of
plassans
to
whom
all
energetic
action
was
distasteful
had
since
the
announcement
of
the
coup
d
etat
preserved
absolute
neutrality
in
the
priests
opinion
the
empire
was
virtually
established
and
they
awaited
an
opportunity
to
resume
in
some
new
direction
their
secular
intrigues
the
marquis
who
had
now
become
a
useless
agent
remained
only
inquisitive
on
one
point
he
wished
to
know
how
the
turmoil
would
finish
and
in
what
manner
the
rougons
would
play
their
role
to
the
end
oh
it
s
you
little
one
he
exclaimed
as
soon
as
he
recognized
felicite
i
wanted
to
see
you
your
affairs
are
getting
muddled
oh
no
everything
is
going
on
all
right
she
replied
in
an
way
so
much
the
better
you
ll
tell
me
all
about
it
won
t
you
ah
i
must
confess
that
i
gave
your
husband
and
his
colleagues
a
terrible
fright
the
other
night
you
should
have
seen
how
comical
they
looked
on
the
terrace
while
i
was
pointing
out
a
band
of
insurgents
in
every
cluster
of
trees
in
the
valley
you
forgive
me
i
m
much
obliged
to
you
said
felicite
quickly
you
should
have
made
them
die
of
fright
my
husband
is
a
big
come
and
see
me
some
morning
when
i
am
then
she
turned
away
as
though
this
meeting
with
the
marquis
had
determined
her
from
head
to
foot
the
whole
of
her
little
person
betokened
implacable
resolution
at
last
she
was
going
to
revenge
herself
on
pierre
for
his
petty
mysteries
have
him
under
her
heel
and
secure
once
for
all
her
omnipotence
at
home
there
would
be
a
fine
scene
quite
a
comedy
indeed
the
points
of
which
she
was
already
enjoying
in
anticipation
while
she
worked
out
her
plan
with
all
the
spitefulness
of
an
injured
woman
she
found
pierre
in
bed
sleeping
heavily
she
brought
the
candle
near
him
for
an
instant
and
gazed
with
an
air
of
compassion
at
his
big
face
across
which
slight
twitches
occasionally
passed
then
she
sat
down
at
the
head
of
the
bed
took
off
her
cap
let
her
hair
fall
loose
assumed
the
appearance
of
one
in
despair
and
began
to
sob
quite
loudly
hallo
what
s
the
matter
what
are
you
crying
for
asked
pierre
suddenly
awaking
she
did
not
reply
but
cried
more
bitterly
come
come
do
answer
continued
her
husband
frightened
by
this
mute
despair
where
have
you
been
have
you
seen
the
insurgents
she
shook
her
head
then
in
a
faint
voice
she
said
i
ve
just
come
from
the
valqueyras
mansion
i
wanted
to
ask
monsieur
de
carnavant
s
advice
ah
my
dear
all
is
pierre
sat
up
in
bed
very
pale
his
bull
neck
which
his
unbuttoned
exposed
to
view
all
his
soft
flabby
flesh
seemed
to
swell
with
terror
at
last
he
sank
back
pale
and
tearful
looking
like
some
grotesque
chinese
figure
in
the
middle
of
the
untidy
bed
the
marquis
continued
felicite
thinks
that
prince
louis
has
succumbed
we
are
ruined
we
shall
never
get
a
thereupon
as
often
happens
with
cowards
pierre
flew
into
a
passion
it
was
the
marquis
s
fault
it
was
his
wife
s
fault
the
fault
of
all
his
family
had
he
ever
thought
of
politics
at
all
until
monsieur
de
carnavant
and
felicite
had
driven
him
to
that
tomfoolery
i
wash
my
hands
of
it
altogether
he
cried
it
s
you
two
who
are
responsible
for
the
blunder
wasn
t
it
better
to
go
on
living
on
our
little
savings
in
peace
and
quietness
but
then
you
were
always
determined
to
have
your
own
way
you
see
what
it
has
brought
us
he
was
losing
his
head
completely
and
forgot
that
he
had
shown
himself
as
eager
as
his
wife
however
his
only
desire
now
was
to
vent
his
anger
by
laying
the
blame
of
his
ruin
upon
others
and
moreover
he
continued
could
we
ever
have
succeeded
with
children
like
ours
eugene
abandons
us
just
at
the
critical
moment
aristide
has
dragged
us
through
the
mire
and
even
that
big
simpleton
pascal
is
compromising
us
by
his
philanthropic
practising
among
the
insurgents
and
to
think
that
we
brought
ourselves
to
poverty
simply
to
give
them
a
university
education
then
as
he
drew
breath
felicite
said
to
him
softly
you
are
forgetting
ah
yes
i
was
forgetting
him
he
resumed
more
violently
than
ever
there
s
another
whom
i
can
t
think
of
without
losing
all
patience
but
that
s
not
all
you
know
little
silvere
well
i
saw
him
at
my
mother
s
the
other
evening
with
his
hands
covered
with
blood
he
has
put
some
gendarme
s
eye
out
i
did
not
tell
you
of
it
as
i
didn
t
want
to
frighten
you
but
you
ll
see
one
of
my
nephews
in
the
assize
court
ah
what
a
family
as
for
macquart
he
has
annoyed
us
to
such
an
extent
that
i
felt
inclined
to
break
his
head
for
him
the
other
day
when
i
had
a
gun
in
my
hand
yes
i
had
a
mind
to
do
felicite
let
the
storm
pass
over
she
had
received
her
husband
s
reproaches
with
angelic
sweetness
bowing
her
head
like
a
culprit
whereby
she
was
able
to
smile
in
her
sleeve
her
demeanour
provoked
and
maddened
pierre
when
speech
failed
the
poor
man
she
heaved
deep
sighs
feigning
repentance
and
then
she
repeated
in
a
disconsolate
voice
whatever
shall
we
do
whatever
shall
we
do
we
are
over
head
and
ears
in
it
s
your
fault
pierre
cried
with
all
his
remaining
strength
the
rougons
in
fact
owed
money
on
every
side
the
hope
of
approaching
success
had
made
them
forget
all
prudence
since
the
beginning
of
they
had
gone
so
far
as
to
entertain
the
frequenters
of
the
yellow
every
evening
with
syrup
and
punch
and
cakes
providing
in
fact
complete
collations
at
which
they
one
and
all
drank
to
the
death
of
the
republic
besides
this
pierre
had
placed
a
quarter
of
his
capital
at
the
disposal
of
the
reactionary
party
as
a
contribution
towards
the
purchase
of
guns
and
cartridges
the
s
bill
amounts
to
at
least
a
thousand
francs
felicite
resumed
in
her
sweetest
tone
and
we
probably
owe
twice
as
much
to
the
then
there
s
the
butcher
the
baker
the
greengrocer
pierre
was
in
agony
and
felicite
struck
him
a
final
blow
by
adding
i
say
nothing
of
the
ten
thousand
francs
you
gave
for
the
i
i
he
faltered
but
i
was
deceived
i
was
robbed
it
was
that
idiot
sicardot
who
let
me
in
for
that
by
swearing
that
the
napoleonists
would
be
triumphant
i
thought
i
was
only
making
an
advance
but
the
old
dolt
will
have
to
repay
me
my
ah
you
won
t
get
anything
back
said
his
wife
shrugging
her
shoulders
we
shall
suffer
the
fate
of
war
when
we
have
paid
off
everything
we
sha
n
t
even
have
enough
to
buy
dry
bread
with
ah
it
s
been
a
fine
campaign
we
can
now
go
and
live
in
some
hovel
in
the
old
this
last
phrase
had
a
most
lugubrious
sound
it
seemed
like
the
knell
of
their
existence
pierre
pictured
the
hovel
in
the
old
quarter
which
had
just
been
mentioned
by
felicite
twas
there
then
that
he
would
die
on
a
pallet
after
striving
all
his
life
for
the
enjoyment
of
ease
and
luxury
in
vain
had
he
robbed
his
mother
steeped
his
hands
in
the
foulest
intrigues
and
lied
and
lied
for
many
a
long
year
the
empire
would
not
pay
his
debts
that
empire
which
alone
could
save
him
he
jumped
out
of
bed
in
his
crying
no
i
ll
take
my
gun
i
would
rather
let
the
insurgents
kill
well
felicite
rejoined
with
great
composure
you
can
have
that
done
or
the
day
after
the
republicans
are
not
far
off
and
that
way
will
do
as
well
as
another
to
make
an
end
of
pierre
shuddered
it
seemed
as
if
some
one
had
suddenly
poured
a
large
pail
of
cold
water
over
his
shoulders
he
slowly
got
into
bed
again
and
when
he
was
warmly
wrapped
up
in
the
sheets
he
began
to
cry
this
fat
fellow
easily
burst
into
tears
gently
flowing
inexhaustible
tears
which
streamed
from
his
eyes
without
an
effort
a
terrible
reaction
was
now
going
on
within
him
after
his
wrath
he
became
as
weak
as
a
child
felicite
who
had
been
waiting
for
this
crisis
was
delighted
to
see
him
so
spiritless
so
resourceless
and
so
humbled
before
her
she
still
preserved
silence
and
an
appearance
of
distressed
humility
after
a
long
pause
her
seeming
resignation
her
mute
dejection
irritated
pierre
s
nerves
but
do
say
something
he
implored
let
us
think
matters
over
together
is
there
really
no
hope
left
us
none
you
know
very
well
she
replied
you
explained
the
situation
yourself
just
now
we
have
no
help
to
expect
from
anyone
even
our
children
have
betrayed
let
us
flee
then
shall
we
leave
plassans
immediately
flee
why
my
dear
we
should
be
the
talk
of
the
whole
town
don
t
you
remember
too
that
you
have
had
the
gates
closed
a
violent
struggle
was
going
on
in
pierre
s
mind
which
he
exerted
to
the
utmost
in
seeking
for
some
solution
at
last
as
though
he
felt
vanquished
he
murmured
in
supplicating
tones
i
beseech
you
do
try
to
think
of
something
you
haven
t
said
anything
felicite
raised
her
head
feigning
surprise
and
with
a
gesture
of
complete
powerlessness
she
said
i
am
a
fool
in
these
matters
i
don
t
understand
anything
about
politics
you
ve
told
me
so
a
hundred
and
then
as
her
embarrassed
husband
held
his
tongue
and
lowered
his
eyes
she
continued
slowly
but
not
reproachfully
you
have
not
kept
me
informed
of
your
affairs
have
you
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
them
i
can
t
even
give
you
any
advice
it
was
quite
right
of
you
though
women
chatter
sometimes
and
it
is
a
thousand
times
better
for
the
men
to
steer
the
ship
she
said
this
with
such
refined
irony
that
her
husband
did
not
detect
that
she
was
deriding
him
he
simply
felt
profound
remorse
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
burst
out
into
a
confession
he
spoke
of
eugene
s
letters
explained
his
plans
his
conduct
with
all
the
loquacity
of
a
man
who
is
relieving
his
conscience
and
imploring
a
saviour
at
every
moment
he
broke
off
to
ask
what
would
you
have
done
in
my
place
or
else
he
cried
isn
t
that
so
i
was
right
i
could
not
act
but
felicite
did
not
even
deign
to
make
a
sign
she
listened
with
all
the
frigid
reserve
of
a
judge
in
reality
she
was
tasting
the
most
exquisite
pleasure
she
had
got
that
fast
at
last
she
played
with
him
like
a
cat
playing
with
a
ball
of
paper
and
he
virtually
held
out
his
hands
to
be
manacled
by
her
but
wait
he
said
hastily
jumping
out
of
bed
i
ll
give
you
eugene
s
correspondence
to
read
you
can
judge
the
situation
better
she
vainly
tried
to
hold
him
back
by
his
he
spread
out
the
letters
on
the
table
by
the
and
then
got
into
bed
again
and
read
whole
pages
of
them
and
compelled
her
to
go
through
them
herself
she
suppressed
a
smile
and
began
to
feel
some
pity
for
the
poor
man
well
he
said
anxiously
when
he
had
finished
now
you
know
everything
do
you
see
any
means
of
saving
us
from
ruin
she
still
gave
no
answer
she
appeared
to
be
pondering
deeply
you
are
an
intelligent
woman
he
continued
in
order
to
flatter
her
i
did
wrong
in
keeping
any
secret
from
you
i
see
it
let
us
say
nothing
more
about
that
she
replied
in
my
opinion
if
you
had
enough
courage
and
as
he
looked
at
her
eagerly
she
broke
off
and
said
with
a
smile
but
you
promise
not
to
distrust
me
any
more
you
will
tell
me
everything
eh
you
will
do
nothing
without
consulting
me
he
swore
and
accepted
the
most
rigid
conditions
felicite
then
got
into
bed
and
in
a
whisper
as
if
she
feared
somebody
might
hear
them
she
explained
at
length
her
plan
of
campaign
in
her
opinion
the
town
must
be
allowed
to
fall
into
still
greater
panic
while
pierre
was
to
maintain
an
heroic
demeanour
in
the
midst
of
the
terrified
inhabitants
a
secret
presentiment
she
said
warned
her
that
the
insurgents
were
still
at
a
distance
moreover
the
party
of
order
would
sooner
or
later
carry
the
day
and
the
rougons
would
be
rewarded
after
the
role
of
deliverer
that
of
martyr
was
not
to
be
despised
and
she
argued
so
well
and
spoke
with
so
much
conviction
that
her
husband
surprised
at
first
by
the
simplicity
of
her
plan
which
consisted
in
facing
it
out
at
last
detected
in
it
a
marvellous
tactical
scheme
and
promised
to
conform
to
it
with
the
greatest
possible
courage
and
don
t
forget
that
it
is
i
who
am
saving
you
the
old
woman
murmured
in
a
coaxing
tone
will
you
be
nice
to
me
they
kissed
each
other
and
said
but
neither
of
them
slept
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
gone
by
pierre
who
had
been
gazing
at
the
round
reflection
of
the
on
the
ceiling
turned
and
in
a
faint
whisper
told
his
wife
of
an
idea
that
had
just
occurred
to
him
oh
no
no
felicite
murmured
with
a
shudder
that
would
be
too
well
he
resumed
but
you
want
to
spread
consternation
among
the
inhabitants
they
would
take
me
seriously
if
what
i
told
you
should
then
perfecting
his
scheme
he
cried
we
might
employ
macquart
that
would
be
a
means
of
getting
rid
of
felicite
seemed
to
be
struck
with
the
idea
she
reflected
seemed
to
hesitate
and
then
in
a
distressful
tone
faltered
perhaps
you
are
right
we
must
see
after
all
we
should
be
very
stupid
if
we
were
for
it
s
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
us
let
me
do
it
i
ll
see
macquart
and
ascertain
if
we
can
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
you
would
only
wrangle
and
spoil
all
sleep
well
my
poor
dear
our
troubles
will
soon
be
ended
you
ll
they
again
kissed
each
other
and
fell
asleep
the
patch
of
light
on
the
ceiling
now
seemed
to
be
assuming
the
shape
of
a
terrified
eye
that
stared
wildly
and
fixedly
upon
the
pale
slumbering
couple
who
reeked
with
crime
beneath
their
very
sheets
and
dreamt
they
could
see
a
rain
of
blood
falling
in
big
drops
which
turned
into
golden
coins
as
they
plashed
upon
the
floor
on
the
morrow
before
daylight
felicite
repaired
to
the
armed
with
instructions
from
pierre
to
seek
an
interview
with
macquart
she
took
her
husband
s
national
guard
uniform
with
her
wrapped
in
a
cloth
there
were
only
a
few
men
fast
asleep
in
the
the
doorkeeper
who
was
entrusted
with
the
duty
of
supplying
macquart
with
food
went
upstairs
with
her
to
open
the
door
of
the
which
had
been
turned
into
a
cell
then
quietly
he
came
down
again
macquart
had
now
been
kept
in
the
room
for
two
days
and
two
nights
he
had
had
time
to
indulge
in
lengthy
reflections
after
his
sleep
his
first
hours
had
been
given
up
to
outbursts
of
impotent
rage
goaded
by
the
idea
that
his
brother
was
lording
it
in
the
adjoining
room
he
had
felt
a
great
longing
to
break
the
door
open
at
all
events
he
would
strangle
rougon
with
his
own
hands
as
soon
as
the
insurgents
should
return
and
release
him
but
in
the
evening
at
twilight
he
calmed
down
and
gave
over
striding
furiously
round
the
little
room
he
inhaled
a
sweet
odour
there
a
feeling
of
comfort
relaxed
his
nerves
monsieur
garconnet
who
was
very
rich
refined
and
vain
had
caused
this
little
room
to
be
arranged
in
a
very
elegant
fashion
the
sofa
was
soft
and
warm
scents
pomades
and
soaps
adorned
the
marble
washstand
and
the
pale
light
fell
from
the
ceiling
with
a
soft
glow
like
the
gleams
of
a
lamp
suspended
in
an
alcove
macquart
amidst
this
perfumed
soporific
atmosphere
fell
asleep
thinking
that
those
scoundrels
the
rich
were
very
fortunate
all
the
he
had
covered
himself
with
a
blanket
which
had
been
given
to
him
and
with
his
head
and
back
and
arms
reposing
on
the
cushions
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
couch
until
morning
when
he
opened
his
eyes
a
ray
of
sunshine
was
gliding
through
the
opening
above
still
he
did
not
leave
the
sofa
he
felt
warm
and
lay
thinking
as
he
gazed
around
him
he
bethought
himself
that
he
would
never
again
have
such
a
place
to
wash
in
the
washstand
particularly
interested
him
it
was
by
no
means
hard
he
thought
to
keep
oneself
spruce
when
one
had
so
many
little
pots
and
phials
at
one
s
disposal
this
made
him
think
bitterly
of
his
own
life
of
privation
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
he
had
been
on
the
wrong
track
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
associating
with
beggars
he
ought
to
have
played
the
scamp
he
should
have
acted
in
concert
with
the
rougons
then
however
he
rejected
this
idea
the
rougons
were
villains
who
had
robbed
him
but
the
warmth
and
softness
of
the
sofa
continued
to
work
upon
his
feelings
and
fill
him
with
vague
regrets
after
all
the
insurgents
were
abandoning
him
and
allowing
themselves
to
be
beaten
like
idiots
eventually
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
republic
was
mere
dupery
those
rougons
were
lucky
and
he
recalled
his
own
bootless
wickedness
and
underhand
intrigues
not
one
member
of
the
family
had
ever
been
on
his
side
neither
aristide
nor
silvere
s
brother
nor
silvere
himself
who
was
a
fool
to
grow
so
enthusiastic
about
the
republic
and
would
never
do
any
good
for
himself
then
macquart
reflected
that
his
wife
was
dead
that
his
children
had
left
him
and
that
he
would
die
alone
like
a
dog
in
some
wretched
corner
without
a
copper
to
bless
himself
with
decidedly
he
ought
to
have
sold
himself
to
the
reactionary
party
pondering
in
this
fashion
he
eyed
the
washstand
feeling
a
strong
inclination
to
go
and
wash
his
hands
with
a
certain
powder
soap
which
he
saw
in
a
glass
jar
like
all
lazy
fellows
who
live
upon
their
wives
or
children
he
had
foppish
tastes
although
he
wore
patched
trousers
he
liked
to
inundate
himself
with
aromatic
oil
he
spent
hours
with
his
barber
who
talked
politics
and
brushed
his
hair
for
him
between
their
discussions
so
at
last
the
temptation
became
too
strong
and
macquart
installed
himself
before
the
washstand
he
washed
his
hands
and
face
dressed
his
hair
perfumed
himself
in
fact
went
through
a
complete
toilet
he
made
use
in
turn
of
all
the
bottles
all
the
various
soaps
and
powders
but
his
greatest
pleasure
was
to
dry
his
hands
with
the
mayor
s
towels
which
were
so
soft
and
thick
he
buried
his
wet
face
in
them
and
inhaled
with
delight
all
the
odour
of
wealth
then
having
pomaded
himself
and
smelling
sweetly
from
head
to
foot
he
once
more
stretched
himself
on
the
sofa
feeling
quite
youthful
again
and
disposed
to
the
most
conciliatory
thoughts
he
felt
yet
greater
contempt
for
the
republic
since
he
had
dipped
his
nose
into
monsieur
garconnet
s
phials
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
perhaps
still
time
for
him
to
make
peace
with
his
brother
he
wondered
what
he
might
well
ask
in
return
for
playing
the
traitor
his
rancour
against
the
rougons
still
gnawed
at
his
heart
but
he
was
in
one
of
those
moods
when
lying
on
one
s
back
in
silence
one
is
apt
to
admit
stern
facts
and
scold
oneself
for
neglecting
to
feather
a
comfortable
nest
in
which
one
may
wallow
in
slothful
ease
even
at
the
cost
of
relinquishing
one
s
most
cherished
animosities
towards
evening
antoine
determined
to
send
for
his
brother
on
the
following
day
but
when
in
the
morning
he
saw
felicite
enter
the
room
he
understood
that
his
aid
was
wanted
so
he
remained
on
his
guard
the
negotiations
were
long
and
full
of
pitfalls
being
conducted
on
either
side
with
infinite
skill
at
first
they
both
indulged
in
vague
complaints
then
felicite
who
was
surprised
to
find
macquart
almost
polite
after
the
violent
manner
in
which
he
had
behaved
at
her
house
on
the
sunday
evening
assumed
a
tone
of
gentle
reproach
she
deplored
the
hatred
which
severed
their
families
but
in
truth
he
had
so
calumniated
his
brother
and
manifested
such
bitter
animosity
towards
him
that
he
had
made
poor
rougon
quite
lose
his
head
but
dash
it
my
brother
has
never
behaved
like
a
brother
to
me
macquart
replied
with
restrained
violence
has
he
ever
given
me
any
assistance
he
would
have
let
me
die
in
my
hovel
when
he
behaved
differently
towards
me
you
remember
at
the
time
he
gave
me
two
hundred
francs
i
am
sure
no
one
can
reproach
me
with
having
said
a
single
unpleasant
word
about
him
i
said
everywhere
that
he
was
a
very
this
clearly
signified
if
you
had
continued
to
supply
me
with
money
i
should
have
been
very
pleasant
towards
you
and
would
have
helped
you
instead
of
fighting
against
you
it
s
your
own
fault
you
ought
to
have
bought
felicite
understood
this
so
well
that
she
replied
i
know
you
have
accused
us
of
being
hard
upon
you
because
you
imagine
we
are
in
comfortable
circumstances
but
you
are
mistaken
my
dear
brother
we
are
poor
people
we
have
never
been
able
to
act
towards
you
as
our
hearts
would
have
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
continued
if
it
were
absolutely
necessary
in
some
serious
contingency
we
might
perhaps
be
able
to
make
a
sacrifice
but
truly
we
are
very
poor
very
poor
macquart
pricked
up
his
ears
i
have
them
he
thought
then
without
appearing
to
understand
his
s
indirect
offer
he
detailed
the
wretchedness
of
his
life
in
a
doleful
manner
and
spoke
of
his
wife
s
death
and
his
children
s
flight
felicite
on
her
side
referred
to
the
crisis
through
which
the
country
was
passing
and
declared
that
the
republic
had
completely
ruined
them
then
from
word
to
word
she
began
to
bemoan
the
exigencies
of
a
situation
which
compelled
one
brother
to
imprison
another
how
their
hearts
would
bleed
if
justice
refused
to
release
its
prey
and
finally
she
let
slip
the
word
galleys
bah
i
defy
you
said
macquart
calmly
but
she
hastily
exclaimed
oh
i
would
rather
redeem
the
honour
of
the
family
with
my
own
blood
i
tell
you
all
this
to
show
you
that
we
shall
not
abandon
you
i
have
come
to
give
you
the
means
of
effecting
your
escape
my
dear
they
gazed
at
each
other
for
a
moment
sounding
each
other
with
a
look
before
engaging
in
the
contest
unconditionally
he
asked
at
length
without
any
condition
she
replied
then
she
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
sofa
and
continued
in
a
determined
voice
and
even
before
crossing
the
frontier
if
you
want
to
earn
a
note
i
can
put
you
in
the
way
of
doing
there
was
another
pause
if
it
s
all
above
board
i
shall
have
no
objection
antoine
muttered
apparently
reflecting
you
know
i
don
t
want
to
mix
myself
up
with
your
underhand
but
there
are
no
underhand
dealings
about
it
felicite
resumed
smiling
at
the
old
rascal
s
scruples
nothing
can
be
more
simple
you
will
presently
leave
this
room
and
go
and
conceal
yourself
in
your
mother
s
house
and
this
evening
you
can
assemble
your
friends
and
come
and
seize
the
macquart
did
not
conceal
his
extreme
surprise
he
did
not
understand
it
at
all
i
thought
he
said
that
you
were
oh
i
haven
t
got
time
now
to
tell
you
all
about
it
the
old
woman
replied
somewhat
impatiently
do
you
accept
or
not
well
no
i
don
t
accept
i
want
to
think
it
over
it
would
be
very
stupid
of
me
to
risk
a
possible
fortune
for
a
thousand
felicite
rose
just
as
you
like
my
dear
fellow
she
said
coldly
you
don
t
seem
to
realise
the
position
you
are
in
you
came
to
my
house
and
treated
me
as
though
i
were
a
mere
outcast
and
then
when
i
am
kind
enough
to
hold
out
a
hand
to
you
in
the
hole
into
which
you
have
stupidly
let
yourself
fall
you
stand
on
ceremony
and
refuse
to
be
rescued
well
then
stay
here
wait
till
the
authorities
come
back
as
for
me
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
with
these
words
she
reached
the
door
but
give
me
some
explanations
he
implored
i
can
t
strike
a
bargain
with
you
in
perfect
ignorance
of
everything
for
two
days
past
i
have
been
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
what
s
going
on
how
do
i
know
that
you
are
not
cheating
me
bah
you
re
a
simpleton
replied
felicite
who
had
retraced
her
steps
at
antoine
s
doleful
appeal
you
are
very
foolish
not
to
trust
yourself
implicitly
to
us
a
thousand
francs
that
s
a
fine
sum
a
sum
that
one
would
only
risk
in
a
winning
cause
i
advise
you
to
he
still
hesitated
but
when
we
want
to
seize
the
place
shall
we
be
allowed
to
enter
quietly
ah
i
don
t
know
she
said
with
a
smile
there
will
perhaps
be
a
shot
or
two
he
looked
at
her
fixedly
well
but
i
say
little
woman
he
resumed
in
a
hoarse
voice
you
don
t
intend
do
you
to
have
a
bullet
lodged
in
my
head
felicite
blushed
she
was
in
fact
just
thinking
that
they
would
be
rendered
a
great
service
if
during
the
attack
on
the
a
bullet
should
rid
them
of
antoine
it
would
be
a
gain
of
a
thousand
francs
besides
all
the
rest
so
she
muttered
with
irritation
what
an
idea
really
it
s
abominable
to
think
such
things
then
suddenly
calming
down
she
added
do
you
accept
you
understand
now
don
t
you
macquart
had
understood
perfectly
it
was
an
ambush
that
they
were
proposing
to
him
he
did
not
perceive
the
reasons
or
the
consequences
of
it
and
this
was
what
induced
him
to
haggle
after
speaking
of
the
republic
as
though
it
were
a
mistress
whom
to
his
great
grief
he
could
no
longer
love
he
recapitulated
the
risks
which
he
would
have
to
run
and
finished
by
asking
for
two
thousand
francs
but
felicite
abided
by
her
original
offer
they
debated
the
matter
until
she
promised
to
procure
him
on
his
return
to
france
some
post
in
which
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
and
which
would
pay
him
well
the
bargain
was
then
concluded
she
made
him
don
the
uniform
she
had
brought
with
her
he
was
to
betake
himself
quietly
to
aunt
dide
s
and
afterwards
towards
midnight
assemble
all
the
republicans
he
could
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
telling
them
that
the
municipal
offices
were
unguarded
and
that
they
had
only
to
push
open
the
door
to
take
possession
of
them
antoine
then
asked
for
earnest
money
and
received
two
hundred
francs
felicite
undertook
to
pay
the
remaining
eight
hundred
on
the
following
day
the
rougons
were
risking
the
last
sum
they
had
at
their
disposal
when
felicite
had
gone
downstairs
she
remained
on
the
square
for
a
moment
to
watch
macquart
go
out
he
passed
the
quietly
blowing
his
nose
he
had
previously
broken
the
skylight
in
the
to
make
it
appear
that
he
had
escaped
that
way
it
s
all
arranged
felicite
said
to
her
husband
when
she
returned
home
it
will
be
at
midnight
it
doesn
t
matter
to
me
at
all
now
i
should
like
to
see
them
all
shot
how
they
slandered
us
yesterday
in
the
street
it
was
rather
silly
of
you
to
hesitate
replied
pierre
who
was
shaving
every
one
would
do
the
same
in
our
that
morning
it
was
a
wednesday
he
was
particularly
careful
about
his
toilet
his
wife
combed
his
hair
and
tied
his
cravat
turning
him
about
like
a
child
going
to
a
distribution
of
prizes
and
when
he
was
ready
she
examined
him
declared
that
he
looked
very
nice
and
that
he
would
make
a
very
good
figure
in
the
midst
of
the
serious
events
that
were
preparing
his
big
pale
face
wore
an
expression
of
grave
dignity
and
heroic
determination
she
accompanied
him
to
the
first
landing
giving
him
her
last
advice
he
was
not
to
depart
in
any
way
from
his
courageous
demeanour
however
great
the
panic
might
be
he
was
to
have
the
gates
closed
more
hermetically
than
ever
and
leave
the
town
in
agonies
of
terror
within
its
ramparts
it
would
be
all
the
better
if
he
were
to
appear
the
only
one
willing
to
die
for
the
cause
of
order
what
a
day
it
was
the
rougons
still
speak
of
it
as
of
a
glorious
and
decisive
battle
pierre
went
straight
to
the
heedless
of
the
looks
or
words
that
greeted
him
on
his
way
he
installed
himself
there
in
magisterial
fashion
like
a
man
who
did
not
intend
to
quit
the
place
whatever
might
happen
and
he
simply
sent
a
note
to
roudier
to
advise
him
that
he
was
resuming
authority
keep
watch
at
the
gates
he
added
knowing
that
these
lines
might
become
public
i
myself
will
watch
over
the
town
and
ensure
the
security
of
life
and
property
it
is
at
the
moment
when
evil
passions
reappear
and
threaten
to
prevail
that
good
citizens
should
endeavour
to
stifle
them
even
at
the
peril
of
their
the
style
and
the
very
errors
in
spelling
made
this
note
the
brevity
of
which
suggested
the
laconic
style
of
the
ancients
appear
all
the
more
heroic
not
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
provisional
commission
put
in
an
appearance
the
last
two
who
had
hitherto
remained
faithful
and
granoux
himself
even
prudently
stopped
at
home
thus
rougon
was
the
only
member
of
the
commission
who
remained
at
his
post
in
his
presidential
all
the
others
having
vanished
as
the
panic
increased
he
did
not
even
deign
to
issue
an
order
summoning
them
to
attend
he
was
there
and
that
sufficed
a
sublime
spectacle
which
a
local
journal
depicted
later
on
in
a
sentence
courage
giving
the
hand
to
during
the
whole
morning
pierre
was
seen
animating
the
with
his
goings
and
comings
he
was
absolutely
alone
in
the
large
empty
building
whose
lofty
halls
reechoed
with
the
noise
of
his
heels
all
the
doors
were
left
open
he
made
an
ostentatious
show
of
his
presidency
over
a
council
in
the
midst
of
this
desert
and
appeared
so
deeply
impressed
with
the
responsibility
of
his
mission
that
the
doorkeeper
meeting
him
two
or
three
times
in
the
passages
bowed
to
him
with
an
air
of
mingled
surprise
and
respect
he
was
seen
too
at
every
window
and
in
spite
of
the
bitter
cold
he
appeared
several
times
on
the
balcony
with
bundles
of
papers
in
his
hand
like
a
busy
man
attending
to
important
despatches
then
towards
noon
he
passed
through
the
town
and
visited
the
speaking
of
a
possible
attack
and
letting
it
be
understood
that
the
insurgents
were
not
far
off
but
he
relied
he
said
on
the
courage
of
the
brave
national
guards
if
necessary
they
must
be
ready
to
die
to
the
last
man
for
the
defence
of
the
good
cause
when
he
returned
from
this
round
slowly
and
solemnly
after
the
manner
of
a
hero
who
has
set
the
affairs
of
his
country
in
order
and
now
only
awaits
death
he
observed
signs
of
perfect
stupor
along
his
path
the
people
promenading
in
the
cours
the
incorrigible
little
householders
whom
no
catastrophe
would
have
prevented
from
coming
at
certain
hours
to
bask
in
the
sun
looked
at
him
in
amazement
as
if
they
did
not
recognize
him
and
could
not
believe
that
one
of
their
own
set
a
former
should
have
the
boldness
to
face
a
whole
army
in
the
town
the
anxiety
was
at
its
height
the
insurrectionists
were
expected
every
moment
the
rumour
of
macquart
s
escape
was
commented
upon
in
a
most
alarming
manner
it
was
asserted
that
he
had
been
rescued
by
his
friends
the
reds
and
that
he
was
only
waiting
for
nighttime
in
order
to
fall
upon
the
inhabitants
and
set
fire
to
the
four
corners
of
the
town
plassans
closed
in
and
gnawing
at
its
own
vitals
within
its
walls
no
longer
knew
what
to
imagine
in
order
to
frighten
itself
the
republicans
in
the
face
of
rougon
s
bold
demeanour
felt
for
a
moment
distrustful
as
for
the
new
town
the
lawyers
and
retired
tradespeople
who
had
denounced
the
yellow
on
the
previous
evening
they
were
so
surprised
that
they
dared
not
again
openly
attack
such
a
valiant
man
they
contented
themselves
with
saying
it
was
madness
to
brave
victorious
insurgents
like
that
and
such
useless
heroism
would
bring
the
greatest
misfortunes
upon
then
at
about
three
o
clock
they
organised
a
deputation
pierre
though
he
was
burning
with
desire
to
make
a
display
of
his
devotion
before
his
had
not
ventured
to
reckon
upon
such
a
fine
opportunity
he
spoke
sublimely
it
was
in
the
mayor
s
private
room
that
the
president
of
the
provisional
commission
received
the
deputation
from
the
new
town
the
gentlemen
of
the
deputation
after
paying
homage
to
his
patriotism
besought
him
to
forego
all
resistance
but
he
in
a
loud
voice
talked
of
duty
of
his
country
of
order
of
liberty
and
various
other
things
moreover
he
did
not
wish
to
compel
any
one
to
imitate
him
he
was
simply
discharging
a
duty
which
his
conscience
and
his
heart
dictated
to
him
you
see
gentlemen
i
am
alone
he
said
in
conclusion
i
will
take
all
the
responsibility
so
that
nobody
but
myself
may
be
compromised
and
if
a
victim
is
required
i
willingly
offer
myself
i
wish
to
sacrifice
my
own
life
for
the
safety
of
the
a
notary
the
wiseacre
of
the
party
remarked
that
he
was
running
to
certain
death
i
know
it
he
resumed
solemnly
i
am
prepared
the
gentlemen
looked
at
each
other
those
words
i
am
prepared
filled
them
with
admiration
decidedly
this
man
was
a
brave
fellow
the
notary
implored
him
to
call
in
the
aid
of
the
gendarmes
but
he
replied
that
the
blood
of
those
brave
soldiers
was
precious
and
he
would
not
have
it
shed
except
in
the
last
extremity
the
deputation
slowly
withdrew
feeling
deeply
moved
an
hour
afterwards
plassans
was
speaking
of
rougon
as
of
a
hero
the
most
cowardly
called
him
an
old
towards
evening
rougon
was
much
surprised
to
see
granoux
hasten
to
him
the
old
threw
himself
in
his
arms
calling
him
great
man
and
declaring
that
he
would
die
with
him
the
words
i
am
prepared
which
had
just
been
reported
to
him
by
his
who
had
heard
it
at
the
greengrocer
s
had
made
him
quite
enthusiastic
there
was
charming
naivete
in
the
nature
of
this
grotesque
timorous
old
man
pierre
kept
him
with
him
thinking
that
he
would
not
be
of
much
consequence
he
was
even
touched
by
the
poor
fellow
s
devotion
and
resolved
to
have
him
publicly
complimented
by
the
prefect
in
order
to
rouse
the
envy
of
the
other
citizens
who
had
so
cowardly
abandoned
him
and
so
both
of
them
awaited
the
night
in
the
deserted
building
at
the
same
time
aristide
was
striding
about
at
home
in
an
uneasy
manner
vuillet
s
article
had
astonished
him
his
father
s
demeanour
stupefied
him
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
him
at
the
window
in
a
white
cravat
and
black
so
calm
at
the
approach
of
danger
that
all
his
ideas
were
upset
yet
the
insurgents
were
coming
back
triumphant
that
was
the
belief
of
the
whole
town
but
aristide
felt
some
doubts
on
the
point
he
had
suspicions
of
some
lugubrious
farce
as
he
did
not
dare
to
present
himself
at
his
parents
house
he
sent
his
wife
thither
and
when
angele
returned
she
said
to
him
in
her
drawling
voice
your
mother
expects
you
she
is
not
angry
at
all
she
seems
rather
to
be
making
fun
of
you
she
told
me
several
times
that
you
could
just
put
your
sling
back
in
your
aristide
felt
terribly
vexed
however
he
ran
to
the
rue
de
la
banne
prepared
to
make
the
most
humble
submission
his
mother
was
content
to
receive
him
with
scornful
laughter
ah
my
poor
fellow
said
she
you
re
certainly
not
very
but
what
can
one
do
in
a
hole
like
plassans
he
angrily
retorted
on
my
word
of
honour
i
am
becoming
a
fool
here
no
news
and
everybody
shivering
that
s
what
it
is
to
be
shut
up
in
these
villainous
ramparts
ah
if
i
had
only
been
able
to
follow
eugene
to
paris
then
seeing
that
his
mother
was
still
smiling
he
added
bitterly
you
haven
t
been
very
kind
to
me
mother
i
know
many
things
i
do
my
brother
kept
you
informed
of
what
was
going
on
and
you
have
never
given
me
the
faintest
hint
that
might
have
been
useful
to
you
know
that
do
you
exclaimed
felicite
becoming
serious
and
distrustful
well
you
re
not
so
foolish
as
i
thought
then
do
you
open
letters
like
some
one
of
my
acquaintance
no
but
i
listen
at
doors
aristide
replied
with
great
assurance
this
frankness
did
not
displease
the
old
woman
she
began
to
smile
again
and
asked
more
softly
well
then
you
blockhead
how
is
it
you
didn
t
rally
to
us
sooner
ah
that
s
where
it
is
the
young
man
said
with
some
embarrassment
i
didn
t
have
much
confidence
in
you
you
received
such
idiots
my
granoux
and
the
others
and
then
i
didn
t
want
to
go
too
far
he
hesitated
and
then
resumed
with
some
uneasiness
you
are
at
least
quite
sure
of
the
success
of
the
coup
d
etat
aren
t
you
i
cried
felicite
wounded
by
her
son
s
doubts
no
i
m
not
sure
of
and
yet
you
sent
word
to
say
that
i
was
to
take
off
my
sling
yes
because
all
the
gentlemen
are
laughing
at
aristide
remained
stock
still
apparently
contemplating
one
of
the
flowers
of
the
and
his
mother
felt
sudden
impatience
as
she
saw
him
hesitating
thus
ah
well
she
said
i
ve
come
back
again
to
my
former
opinion
you
re
not
very
shrewd
and
you
think
you
ought
to
have
had
eugene
s
letters
to
read
why
my
poor
fellow
you
would
have
spoilt
everything
with
your
perpetual
vacillation
you
never
can
make
up
your
mind
you
are
hesitating
i
hesitate
he
interrupted
giving
his
mother
a
cold
keen
glance
ah
well
you
don
t
know
me
i
would
set
the
whole
town
on
fire
if
it
were
necessary
and
i
wanted
to
warm
my
feet
but
understand
me
i
ve
no
desire
to
take
the
wrong
road
i
m
tired
of
eating
hard
bread
and
i
hope
to
play
fortune
a
trick
but
i
only
play
for
he
spoke
these
words
so
sharply
with
such
a
keen
longing
for
success
that
his
mother
recognised
the
cry
of
her
own
blood
your
father
is
very
brave
she
whispered
yes
i
ve
seen
him
he
resumed
with
a
sneer
he
s
got
a
fine
look
on
him
he
reminded
me
of
leonidas
at
thermopylae
is
it
you
mother
who
have
made
him
cut
this
figure
and
he
added
cheerfully
with
a
gesture
of
determination
well
so
much
the
worse
i
m
a
bonapartist
father
is
not
the
man
to
risk
the
chance
of
being
killed
unless
it
pays
him
you
re
quite
right
his
mother
replied
i
mustn
t
say
anything
but
you
ll
he
did
not
press
her
but
swore
that
she
would
soon
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
him
and
then
he
took
his
departure
while
felicite
feeling
her
old
preference
reviving
said
to
herself
at
the
window
as
she
watched
him
going
off
that
he
had
the
devil
s
own
wit
that
she
would
never
have
had
sufficient
courage
to
let
him
leave
without
setting
him
in
the
right
path
and
now
for
the
third
time
a
night
full
of
anguish
fell
upon
plassans
the
unhappy
town
was
almost
at
its
the
citizens
hastened
home
and
barricaded
their
doors
with
a
great
clattering
of
iron
bolts
and
bars
the
general
feeling
seemed
to
be
that
by
the
morrow
plassans
would
no
longer
exist
that
it
would
either
be
swallowed
up
by
the
earth
or
would
evaporate
in
the
atmosphere
when
rougon
went
home
to
dine
he
found
the
streets
completely
deserted
this
desolation
made
him
sad
and
melancholy
as
a
result
of
this
when
he
had
finished
his
meal
he
felt
some
slight
misgivings
and
asked
his
wife
if
it
were
necessary
to
follow
up
the
insurrection
that
macquart
was
preparing
nobody
will
run
us
down
now
said
he
you
should
have
seen
those
gentlemen
of
the
new
town
how
they
bowed
to
me
it
seems
to
me
quite
unnecessary
now
to
kill
anybody
eh
what
do
you
think
we
shall
feather
our
nest
without
ah
what
a
nerveless
fellow
you
are
felicite
cried
angrily
it
was
your
own
idea
to
do
it
and
now
you
back
out
i
tell
you
that
you
ll
never
do
anything
without
me
go
then
go
your
own
way
do
you
think
the
republicans
would
spare
you
if
they
got
hold
of
you
rougon
went
back
to
the
and
prepared
for
the
ambush
granoux
was
very
useful
to
him
he
despatched
him
with
orders
to
the
different
posts
guarding
the
ramparts
the
national
guards
were
to
repair
to
the
in
small
detachments
as
secretly
as
possible
roudier
that
bourgeois
who
was
quite
out
of
his
element
in
the
provinces
and
who
would
have
spoilt
the
whole
affair
with
his
humanitarian
preaching
was
not
even
informed
of
it
towards
eleven
o
clock
the
of
the
was
full
of
national
guards
then
rougon
frightened
them
he
told
them
that
the
republicans
still
remaining
in
plassans
were
about
to
attempt
a
desperate
de
and
plumed
himself
on
having
been
warned
in
time
by
his
secret
police
when
he
had
pictured
the
bloody
massacre
which
would
overtake
the
town
should
these
wretches
get
the
upper
hand
he
ordered
his
men
to
cease
speaking
and
extinguish
all
lights
he
took
a
gun
himself
ever
since
the
morning
he
had
been
living
as
in
a
dream
he
no
longer
knew
himself
he
felt
felicite
behind
him
the
crisis
of
the
previous
night
had
thrown
him
into
her
hands
and
he
would
have
allowed
himself
to
be
hanged
thinking
it
does
not
matter
my
wife
will
come
and
cut
me
to
augment
the
tumult
and
prolong
the
terror
of
the
slumbering
town
he
begged
granoux
to
repair
to
the
cathedral
and
have
the
tocsin
rung
at
the
first
shots
he
might
hear
the
marquis
s
name
would
open
the
beadle
s
door
and
then
in
darkness
and
dismal
silence
the
national
guards
waited
in
the
yard
in
a
terrible
state
of
anxiety
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
porch
eager
to
fire
as
though
they
were
lying
in
wait
for
a
pack
of
wolves
in
the
meantime
macquart
had
spent
the
day
at
aunt
dide
s
house
stretching
himself
on
the
old
coffer
and
lamenting
the
loss
of
monsieur
garconnet
s
sofa
he
had
several
times
felt
a
mad
inclination
to
break
into
his
two
hundred
francs
at
some
neighbouring
cafe
this
money
was
burning
a
hole
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
however
he
whiled
away
his
time
by
spending
it
in
imagination
his
mother
moved
about
in
her
stiff
automatic
way
as
if
she
were
not
even
aware
of
his
presence
during
the
last
few
days
her
children
had
been
coming
to
her
rather
frequently
in
a
state
of
pallor
and
desperation
but
she
departed
neither
from
her
taciturnity
nor
her
stiff
lifeless
expression
she
knew
nothing
of
the
fears
which
were
throwing
the
town
she
was
a
thousand
leagues
away
from
plassans
soaring
into
the
one
constant
fixed
idea
which
imparted
such
a
blank
stare
to
her
eyes
now
and
again
however
at
this
particular
moment
some
feeling
of
uneasiness
some
human
anxiety
occasionally
made
her
blink
antoine
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
of
having
something
nice
to
eat
sent
her
to
get
a
roast
chicken
from
an
in
the
faubourg
when
it
was
set
on
the
table
hey
he
said
to
her
you
don
t
often
eat
fowl
do
you
it
s
only
for
those
who
work
and
know
how
to
manage
their
affairs
as
for
you
you
always
squandered
everything
i
bet
you
re
giving
all
your
savings
to
that
little
hypocrite
silvere
he
s
got
a
mistress
the
sly
fellow
if
you
ve
a
hoard
of
money
hidden
in
some
corner
he
ll
ease
you
of
it
nicely
some
macquart
was
in
a
jesting
mood
glowing
with
wild
exultation
the
money
he
had
in
his
pocket
the
treachery
he
was
preparing
the
conviction
that
he
had
sold
himself
at
a
good
price
all
filled
him
with
the
characteristic
of
vicious
people
who
naturally
became
merry
and
scornful
amidst
their
evil
practices
of
all
his
talk
however
aunt
dide
only
heard
silvere
s
name
have
you
seen
him
she
asked
opening
her
lips
at
last
who
silvere
antoine
replied
he
was
walking
about
among
the
insurgents
with
a
tall
red
girl
on
his
arm
it
will
serve
him
right
if
he
gets
into
the
grandmother
looked
at
him
fixedly
then
in
a
solemn
voice
inquired
why
eh
why
he
shouldn
t
be
so
stupid
resumed
macquart
feeling
somewhat
embarrassed
people
don
t
risk
their
necks
for
the
sake
of
ideas
i
ve
settled
my
own
little
business
i
m
no
but
aunt
dide
was
no
longer
listening
to
him
she
was
murmuring
he
had
his
hands
covered
with
blood
they
ll
kill
him
like
the
other
one
his
uncles
will
send
the
gendarmes
after
what
are
you
muttering
there
asked
her
son
as
he
finished
picking
the
bones
of
the
chicken
you
know
i
like
people
to
accuse
me
to
my
face
if
i
have
sometimes
talked
to
the
little
fellow
about
the
republic
it
was
only
to
bring
him
round
to
a
more
reasonable
way
of
thinking
he
was
dotty
i
love
liberty
myself
but
it
mustn
t
degenerate
into
license
and
as
for
rougon
i
esteem
him
he
s
a
man
of
courage
and
he
had
the
gun
hadn
t
he
interrupted
aunt
dide
whose
wandering
mind
seemed
to
be
following
silvere
far
away
along
the
high
road
the
gun
ah
yes
macquart
s
carbine
continued
antoine
after
casting
a
glance
at
the
where
the
was
usually
hung
i
fancy
i
saw
it
in
his
hands
a
fine
instrument
to
scour
the
country
with
when
one
has
a
girl
on
one
s
arm
what
a
fool
then
he
thought
he
might
as
well
indulge
in
a
few
coarse
jokes
aunt
dide
had
begun
to
bustle
about
the
room
again
she
did
not
say
a
word
towards
the
evening
antoine
went
out
after
putting
on
a
blouse
and
pulling
over
his
eyes
a
big
cap
which
his
mother
had
bought
for
him
he
returned
into
the
town
in
the
same
manner
as
he
had
quitted
it
by
relating
some
nonsensical
story
to
the
national
guards
who
were
on
duty
at
the
rome
gate
then
he
made
his
way
to
the
old
quarter
where
he
crept
from
house
to
house
in
a
mysterious
manner
all
the
republicans
of
advanced
views
all
the
members
of
the
brotherhood
who
had
not
followed
the
insurrectionary
army
met
in
an
obscure
inn
where
macquart
had
made
an
appointment
with
them
when
about
fifty
men
were
assembled
he
made
a
speech
in
which
he
spoke
of
personal
vengeance
that
must
be
wreaked
of
a
victory
that
must
be
gained
and
of
a
disgraceful
yoke
that
must
be
thrown
off
and
he
ended
by
undertaking
to
deliver
the
over
to
them
in
ten
minutes
he
had
just
left
it
it
was
quite
unguarded
he
said
and
the
red
flag
would
wave
over
it
that
very
night
if
they
so
desired
the
workmen
deliberated
at
that
moment
the
reaction
seemed
to
be
in
its
death
throes
the
insurgents
were
virtually
at
the
gates
of
the
town
it
would
therefore
be
more
honourable
to
make
an
effort
to
regain
power
without
awaiting
their
return
so
as
to
be
able
to
receive
them
as
brothers
with
the
gates
wide
open
and
the
streets
and
squares
adorned
with
flags
moreover
none
of
those
present
distrusted
macquart
his
hatred
of
the
rougons
the
personal
vengeance
of
which
he
spoke
could
be
taken
as
guaranteeing
his
loyalty
it
was
arranged
that
each
of
them
who
was
a
sportsman
and
had
a
gun
at
home
should
fetch
it
and
that
the
band
should
assemble
at
midnight
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
a
question
of
detail
very
nearly
put
an
end
to
their
plans
they
had
no
bullets
however
they
decided
to
load
their
weapons
with
small
shot
and
even
that
seemed
unnecessary
as
they
were
told
that
they
would
meet
with
no
resistance
once
more
plassans
beheld
a
band
of
armed
men
filing
along
close
to
the
houses
in
the
quiet
moonlight
when
the
band
was
assembled
in
front
of
the
macquart
while
keeping
a
sharp
boldly
advanced
to
the
building
he
knocked
and
when
the
who
had
learnt
his
lesson
asked
what
was
wanted
he
uttered
such
terrible
threats
that
the
man
feigning
fright
made
haste
to
open
the
door
both
leaves
of
it
swung
back
slowly
and
the
porch
then
lay
open
and
empty
before
them
while
macquart
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
come
on
my
friends
that
was
the
signal
he
himself
quickly
jumped
aside
and
as
the
republicans
rushed
in
there
came
from
the
darkness
of
the
yard
a
stream
of
fire
and
a
hail
of
bullets
which
swept
through
the
gaping
porch
with
a
roar
as
of
thunder
the
doorway
vomited
death
the
national
guards
exasperated
by
their
long
wait
eager
to
shake
off
the
discomfort
weighing
upon
them
in
that
dismal
had
fired
a
volley
with
feverish
haste
the
flash
of
the
firing
was
so
bright
that
through
the
yellow
gleams
macquart
distinctly
saw
rougon
taking
aim
he
fancied
that
his
brother
s
gun
was
deliberately
levelled
at
himself
and
he
recalled
felicite
s
blush
and
made
his
escape
muttering
no
tricks
the
rascal
would
kill
me
he
owes
me
eight
hundred
in
the
meantime
a
loud
howl
had
arisen
amid
the
darkness
the
surprised
republicans
shouted
treachery
and
fired
in
their
turn
a
national
guard
fell
under
the
porch
but
the
republicans
on
their
side
had
three
dead
they
took
to
flight
stumbling
over
the
corpses
stricken
with
panic
and
shouting
through
the
quiet
lanes
our
brothers
are
being
murdered
in
despairing
voices
which
found
no
echo
thereupon
the
defenders
of
order
having
had
time
to
reload
their
weapons
rushed
into
the
empty
square
firing
at
every
street
corner
wherever
the
darkness
of
a
door
the
shadow
of
a
or
the
jutting
of
a
stone
made
them
fancy
they
saw
an
insurgent
in
this
wise
they
remained
there
ten
minutes
firing
into
space
the
affray
had
burst
over
the
slumbering
town
like
a
thunderclap
the
inhabitants
in
the
neighbouring
streets
roused
from
sleep
by
this
terrible
fusillade
sat
up
in
bed
their
teeth
chattering
with
fright
nothing
in
the
world
would
have
induced
them
to
poke
their
noses
out
of
the
window
and
slowly
athwart
the
air
in
which
the
shots
had
suddenly
resounded
one
of
the
cathedral
bells
began
to
ring
the
tocsin
with
so
irregular
so
strange
a
rhythm
that
one
might
have
thought
the
noise
to
be
the
hammering
of
an
anvil
or
the
echoes
of
a
colossal
kettle
struck
by
a
child
in
a
fit
of
passion
this
howling
bell
whose
sound
the
citizens
did
not
recognise
terrified
them
yet
more
than
the
reports
of
the
had
done
and
there
were
some
who
thought
they
heard
an
endless
train
of
artillery
rumbling
over
the
they
lay
down
again
and
buried
themselves
beneath
their
blankets
as
if
they
would
have
incurred
some
danger
by
still
sitting
up
in
bed
in
their
rooms
with
their
sheets
drawn
up
to
their
chins
they
held
their
breath
and
made
themselves
as
small
as
possible
while
their
wives
by
their
side
almost
fainted
with
terror
as
they
buried
their
heads
among
the
pillows
the
national
guards
who
had
remained
at
the
ramparts
had
also
heard
the
shots
and
thinking
that
the
insurgents
had
entered
by
means
of
some
subterranean
passage
they
ran
up
in
groups
of
five
or
six
disturbing
the
silence
of
the
streets
with
the
tumult
of
their
excited
rush
roudier
was
one
of
the
first
to
arrive
however
rougon
sent
them
all
back
to
their
posts
after
reprimanding
them
severely
for
abandoning
the
gates
of
the
town
thrown
into
consternation
by
this
reproach
for
in
their
panic
they
had
in
fact
left
the
gates
absolutely
defenceless
they
again
set
off
at
a
gallop
hurrying
through
the
streets
with
still
more
frightful
uproar
plassans
might
well
have
thought
that
an
infuriated
army
was
crossing
it
in
all
directions
the
fusillade
the
tocsin
the
marches
and
countermarches
of
the
national
guards
the
weapons
which
were
being
dragged
along
like
clubs
the
terrified
cries
in
the
darkness
all
produced
a
deafening
tumult
such
as
might
break
forth
in
a
town
taken
by
assault
and
given
over
to
plunder
it
was
the
final
blow
of
the
unfortunate
inhabitants
who
really
believed
that
the
insurgents
had
arrived
they
had
indeed
said
that
it
would
be
their
last
night
that
plassans
would
be
swallowed
up
in
the
earth
or
would
evaporate
into
smoke
before
daybreak
and
now
lying
in
their
beds
they
awaited
the
catastrophe
in
the
most
abject
terror
fancying
at
times
that
their
houses
were
already
tottering
meantime
granoux
still
rang
the
tocsin
when
in
other
respects
silence
had
again
fallen
upon
the
town
the
mournfulness
of
that
ringing
became
intolerable
rougon
who
was
in
a
high
fever
felt
exasperated
by
its
distant
wailing
he
hastened
to
the
cathedral
and
found
the
door
open
the
beadle
was
on
the
threshold
ah
that
s
quite
enough
he
shouted
to
the
man
anybody
would
think
there
was
some
one
crying
it
s
quite
but
it
isn
t
me
sir
replied
the
beadle
in
a
distressed
manner
it
s
monsieur
granoux
he
s
gone
up
into
the
steeple
i
must
tell
you
that
i
removed
the
clapper
of
the
bell
by
his
reverence
s
order
precisely
to
prevent
the
tocsin
from
being
sounded
but
monsieur
granoux
wouldn
t
listen
to
reason
he
climbed
up
and
i
ve
no
idea
what
he
can
be
making
that
noise
thereupon
rougon
hastily
ascended
the
staircase
which
led
to
the
bells
shouting
that
will
do
that
will
do
for
goodness
sake
leave
off
when
he
had
reached
the
top
he
caught
sight
of
granoux
by
the
light
of
the
moon
which
glided
through
an
embrasure
the
ex
almond
dealer
was
standing
there
hatless
and
dealing
furious
blows
with
a
heavy
hammer
he
did
so
with
a
right
good
will
he
first
threw
himself
back
then
took
a
spring
and
finally
fell
upon
the
sonorous
bronze
as
if
he
wanted
to
crack
it
one
might
have
thought
he
was
a
blacksmith
striking
hot
iron
but
a
blacksmith
short
and
bald
working
in
a
wild
and
awkward
way
surprise
kept
rougon
motionless
for
a
moment
at
the
sight
of
this
frantic
bourgeois
thus
belabouring
the
bell
in
the
moonlight
then
he
understood
the
clang
which
this
strange
ringer
had
disseminated
over
the
town
he
shouted
to
him
to
stop
but
granoux
did
not
hear
rougon
was
obliged
to
take
hold
of
his
and
then
the
other
recognising
him
exclaimed
in
a
triumphant
voice
ah
you
ve
heard
it
at
first
i
tried
to
knock
the
bell
with
my
fists
but
that
hurt
me
fortunately
i
found
this
hammer
just
a
few
more
blows
eh
however
rougon
dragged
him
away
granoux
was
radiant
he
wiped
his
forehead
and
made
his
companion
promise
to
let
everybody
know
in
the
morning
that
he
had
produced
all
that
noise
with
a
mere
hammer
what
an
achievement
and
what
a
position
of
importance
that
furious
ringing
would
confer
upon
him
towards
morning
rougon
bethought
himself
of
reassuring
felicite
in
accordance
with
his
orders
the
national
guards
had
shut
themselves
up
in
the
he
had
forbidden
them
to
remove
the
corpses
under
the
pretext
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
the
populace
of
the
old
quarter
a
lesson
and
as
while
hastening
to
the
rue
de
la
banne
he
passed
over
the
square
on
which
the
moon
was
no
longer
shining
he
inadvertently
stepped
on
the
clenched
hand
of
a
corpse
that
lay
beside
the
footpath
at
this
he
almost
fell
that
soft
hand
which
yielded
beneath
his
heel
brought
him
an
indefinable
sensation
of
disgust
and
horror
and
thereupon
he
hastened
at
full
speed
along
the
deserted
streets
fancying
that
a
bloody
fist
was
pursuing
him
there
are
four
of
them
on
the
ground
he
said
as
he
entered
his
house
he
and
his
wife
looked
at
one
another
as
though
they
were
astonished
at
their
crime
the
lamplight
imparted
the
hue
of
yellow
wax
to
their
pale
faces
have
you
left
them
there
asked
felicite
they
must
be
found
of
course
i
didn
t
pick
them
up
they
are
lying
on
their
backs
i
stepped
on
something
soft
then
he
looked
at
his
boot
its
heel
was
covered
with
blood
while
he
was
putting
on
a
pair
of
shoes
felicite
resumed
well
so
much
the
better
it
s
over
now
people
won
t
be
inclined
to
repeat
that
you
only
fire
at
the
fusillade
which
the
rougons
had
planned
in
order
that
they
might
be
finally
recognised
as
the
saviours
of
plassans
brought
the
whole
terrified
and
grateful
town
to
their
feet
the
day
broke
mournfully
with
the
grey
melancholy
of
a
the
inhabitants
hearing
nothing
further
ventured
forth
weary
of
trembling
beneath
their
sheets
at
first
some
ten
or
fifteen
appeared
later
on
when
a
rumour
spread
that
the
insurgents
had
taken
flight
leaving
their
dead
in
every
gutter
plassans
rose
in
a
body
and
descended
upon
the
throughout
the
morning
people
strolled
inquisitively
round
the
four
corpses
they
were
horribly
mutilated
particularly
one
which
had
three
bullets
in
the
head
but
the
most
horrible
to
look
upon
was
the
body
of
a
national
guard
who
had
fallen
under
the
porch
he
had
received
a
charge
of
the
small
shot
used
by
the
republicans
in
lieu
of
bullets
full
in
the
face
and
blood
oozed
from
his
torn
and
riddled
countenance
the
crowd
feasted
their
eyes
upon
this
horror
with
the
avidity
for
revolting
spectacles
which
is
so
characteristic
of
cowards
the
national
guard
was
freely
recognised
he
was
the
dubruel
the
man
whom
roudier
had
accused
on
the
monday
morning
of
having
fired
with
culpable
eagerness
of
the
three
other
corpses
two
were
journeymen
hatters
the
third
was
not
identified
for
a
long
while
gaping
groups
remained
shuddering
in
front
of
the
red
pools
which
stained
the
pavement
often
looking
behind
them
with
an
air
of
mistrust
as
though
that
summary
justice
which
had
restored
order
during
the
night
by
force
of
arms
were
even
now
watching
and
listening
to
them
ready
to
shoot
them
down
in
their
turn
unless
they
kissed
with
enthusiasm
the
hand
that
had
just
rescued
them
from
the
demagogy
the
panic
of
the
night
further
augmented
the
terrible
effect
produced
in
the
morning
by
the
sight
of
the
four
corpses
the
true
history
of
the
fusillade
was
never
known
the
firing
of
the
combatants
granoux
s
hammering
the
rush
of
the
national
guards
through
the
streets
had
filled
people
s
ears
with
such
terrifying
sounds
that
most
of
them
dreamed
of
a
gigantic
battle
waged
against
countless
enemies
when
the
victors
magnifying
the
number
of
their
adversaries
with
instinctive
braggardism
spoke
of
about
five
hundred
men
everybody
protested
against
such
a
low
estimate
some
citizens
asserted
that
they
had
looked
out
of
their
windows
and
seen
an
immense
stream
of
fugitives
passing
by
for
more
than
an
hour
moreover
everybody
had
heard
the
bandits
running
about
five
hundred
men
would
never
have
been
able
to
rouse
a
whole
town
it
must
have
been
an
army
and
a
fine
big
army
too
which
the
brave
militia
of
plassans
had
driven
back
into
the
this
phrase
of
their
having
been
driven
back
into
the
ground
first
used
by
rougon
struck
people
as
being
singularly
appropriate
for
the
guards
who
were
charged
with
the
defence
of
the
ramparts
swore
by
all
that
was
holy
that
not
a
single
man
had
entered
or
quitted
the
town
a
circumstance
which
tinged
what
had
happened
with
mystery
even
suggesting
the
idea
of
horned
demons
who
had
vanished
amidst
flames
and
thus
fairly
upsetting
the
minds
of
the
multitude
it
is
true
the
guards
avoided
all
mention
of
their
mad
gallops
and
so
the
more
rational
citizens
were
inclined
to
believe
that
a
band
of
insurgents
had
really
entered
the
town
either
by
a
breach
in
the
wall
or
some
other
channel
later
on
rumours
of
treachery
were
spread
abroad
and
people
talked
of
an
ambush
the
cruel
truth
could
no
longer
be
concealed
by
the
men
whom
macquart
had
led
to
slaughter
but
so
much
terror
still
prevailed
and
the
sight
of
blood
had
thrown
so
many
cowards
into
the
arms
of
the
reactionary
party
that
these
rumours
were
attributed
to
the
rage
of
the
vanquished
republicans
it
was
asserted
on
the
other
hand
that
macquart
had
been
made
prisoner
by
rougon
who
kept
him
in
a
damp
cell
where
he
was
letting
him
slowly
die
of
starvation
this
horrible
tale
made
people
bow
to
the
very
ground
whenever
they
encountered
rougon
thus
it
was
that
this
grotesque
personage
this
pale
flabby
citizen
became
in
one
night
a
terrible
captain
whom
nobody
dared
to
ridicule
any
more
he
had
steeped
his
foot
in
blood
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
quarter
stood
dumb
with
fright
before
the
corpses
but
towards
ten
o
clock
when
the
respectable
people
of
the
new
town
arrived
the
whole
square
hummed
with
subdued
chatter
people
spoke
of
the
other
attack
of
the
seizure
of
the
mayor
s
office
in
which
a
mirror
only
had
been
wounded
but
this
time
they
no
longer
rougon
they
spoke
of
him
with
respectful
dismay
he
was
indeed
a
hero
a
deliverer
the
corpses
with
open
eyes
stared
at
those
gentlemen
the
lawyers
and
householders
who
shuddered
as
they
murmured
that
civil
war
had
many
cruel
necessities
the
notary
the
chief
of
the
deputation
sent
to
the
on
the
previous
evening
went
from
group
to
group
recalling
the
proud
words
i
am
prepared
then
used
by
the
energetic
man
to
whom
the
town
owed
its
safety
there
was
a
general
feeling
of
humiliation
those
who
had
railed
most
cruelly
against
the
those
especially
who
had
referred
to
the
rougons
as
intriguers
and
cowards
who
merely
fired
shots
in
the
air
were
the
first
to
speak
of
granting
a
crown
of
laurels
to
the
noble
citizen
of
whom
plassans
would
be
for
ever
for
the
pools
of
blood
were
drying
on
the
pavement
and
the
corpses
proclaimed
to
what
a
degree
of
audacity
the
party
of
disorder
pillage
and
murder
had
gone
and
what
an
iron
hand
had
been
required
to
put
down
the
insurrection
moreover
the
whole
crowd
was
eager
to
congratulate
granoux
and
shake
hands
with
him
the
story
of
the
hammer
had
become
known
by
an
innocent
falsehood
however
of
which
he
himself
soon
became
unconscious
he
asserted
that
having
been
the
first
to
see
the
insurgents
he
had
set
about
striking
the
bell
in
order
to
sound
the
alarm
so
that
but
for
him
the
national
guards
would
have
been
massacred
this
doubled
his
importance
his
achievement
was
declared
prodigious
people
spoke
of
him
now
as
monsieur
isidore
don
t
you
know
the
gentleman
who
sounded
the
tocsin
with
a
hammer
although
the
sentence
was
somewhat
lengthy
granoux
would
willingly
have
accepted
it
as
a
title
of
nobility
and
from
that
day
forward
he
never
heard
the
word
hammer
pronounced
without
imagining
it
to
be
some
delicate
flattery
while
the
corpses
were
being
removed
aristide
came
to
look
at
them
he
examined
them
on
all
sides
sniffing
and
looking
inquisitively
at
their
faces
his
eyes
were
bright
and
he
had
a
sharp
expression
of
countenance
in
order
to
see
some
wound
the
better
he
even
lifted
up
the
blouse
of
one
corpse
with
the
very
hand
which
on
the
previous
day
had
been
suspended
in
a
sling
this
examination
seemed
to
convince
him
and
remove
all
doubt
from
his
mind
he
bit
his
lips
remained
there
for
a
moment
in
silence
and
then
went
off
for
the
purpose
of
hastening
the
issue
of
the
independant
for
which
he
had
written
a
most
important
article
and
as
he
hurried
along
beside
the
houses
he
recalled
his
mother
s
words
you
will
see
well
he
had
seen
now
it
was
very
clever
it
even
frightened
him
somewhat
in
the
meantime
rougon
s
triumph
was
beginning
to
embarrass
him
alone
in
monsieur
garconnet
s
office
hearing
the
buzzing
of
the
crowd
he
became
conscious
of
a
strange
feeling
which
prevented
him
from
showing
himself
on
the
balcony
that
blood
in
which
he
had
stepped
seemed
to
have
numbed
his
legs
he
wondered
what
he
should
do
until
the
evening
his
poor
empty
brain
upset
by
the
events
of
the
night
sought
desperately
for
some
occupation
some
order
to
give
or
some
measure
to
be
taken
which
might
afford
him
some
distraction
but
he
could
think
about
nothing
clearly
whither
was
felicite
leading
him
was
it
really
all
finished
now
or
would
he
still
have
to
kill
somebody
else
then
fear
again
assailed
him
terrible
doubts
arose
in
his
mind
and
he
already
saw
the
ramparts
broken
down
on
all
sides
by
an
avenging
army
of
the
republicans
when
a
loud
shout
the
insurgents
the
insurgents
burst
forth
under
the
very
windows
of
his
room
at
this
he
jumped
up
and
raising
a
curtain
saw
the
crowd
rushing
about
the
square
in
a
state
of
terror
what
a
thunderbolt
in
less
than
a
second
he
pictured
himself
ruined
plundered
and
murdered
he
cursed
his
wife
he
cursed
the
whole
town
then
as
he
looked
behind
him
in
a
suspicious
manner
seeking
some
means
of
escape
he
heard
the
mob
break
out
into
applause
uttering
shouts
of
joy
making
the
very
glass
rattle
with
their
wild
delight
then
he
returned
to
the
window
the
women
were
waving
their
handkerchiefs
and
the
men
were
embracing
each
other
there
were
some
among
them
who
joined
hands
and
began
to
dance
rougon
stood
there
stupefied
unable
to
comprehend
it
all
and
feeling
his
head
swimming
the
big
deserted
silent
building
in
which
he
was
alone
quite
frightened
him
when
he
afterwards
confessed
his
feelings
to
felicite
he
was
unable
to
say
how
long
his
torture
had
lasted
he
only
remembered
that
a
noise
of
footsteps
through
the
vast
halls
had
roused
him
from
his
stupor
he
expected
to
be
attacked
by
men
in
blouses
armed
with
scythes
and
clubs
whereas
it
was
the
municipal
commission
which
entered
quite
orderly
and
in
evening
dress
each
member
with
a
beaming
countenance
not
one
of
them
was
absent
a
piece
of
good
news
had
simultaneously
cured
all
these
gentlemen
granoux
rushed
into
the
arms
of
his
dear
president
the
soldiers
he
stammered
the
soldiers
a
regiment
had
in
fact
just
arrived
under
the
command
of
colonel
masson
and
monsieur
de
bleriot
prefect
of
the
department
the
gunbarrels
which
had
been
observed
from
the
ramparts
far
away
in
the
plain
had
at
first
suggested
the
approach
of
the
insurgents
rougon
was
so
deeply
moved
on
learning
the
truth
that
two
big
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
he
was
weeping
the
great
citizen
the
municipal
commission
watched
those
big
tears
with
most
respectful
admiration
but
granoux
again
threw
himself
on
his
friend
s
neck
crying
ah
how
glad
i
am
you
know
i
m
a
straightforward
man
well
we
were
all
of
us
afraid
it
is
not
so
gentlemen
you
alone
were
great
brave
sublime
what
energy
you
must
have
had
i
was
just
now
saying
to
my
wife
rougon
is
a
great
man
he
deserves
to
be
then
the
gentlemen
proposed
to
go
and
meet
the
prefect
for
a
moment
rougon
felt
both
stunned
and
suffocated
he
was
unable
to
believe
in
this
sudden
triumph
and
stammered
like
a
child
however
he
drew
breath
and
went
downstairs
with
the
quiet
dignity
suited
to
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
but
the
enthusiasm
which
greeted
the
commission
and
its
president
outside
the
almost
upset
his
magisterial
gravity
afresh
his
name
sped
through
the
crowd
accompanied
this
time
by
the
warmest
eulogies
he
heard
everyone
repeat
granoux
s
avowal
and
treat
him
as
a
hero
who
had
stood
firm
and
resolute
amidst
universal
panic
and
as
far
as
the
where
the
commission
met
the
prefect
he
drank
his
fill
of
popularity
and
glory
monsieur
de
bleriot
and
colonel
masson
had
entered
the
town
alone
leaving
their
troops
encamped
on
the
lyons
road
they
had
lost
considerable
time
through
a
misunderstanding
as
to
the
direction
taken
by
the
insurgents
now
however
they
knew
the
latter
were
at
orcheres
and
it
would
only
be
necessary
to
stop
an
hour
at
plassans
just
sufficient
time
to
reassure
the
population
and
publish
the
cruel
ordinances
which
decreed
the
sequestration
of
the
insurgents
property
and
death
to
every
individual
who
might
be
taken
with
arms
in
his
hands
colonel
masson
smiled
when
in
accordance
with
the
orders
of
the
commander
of
the
national
guards
the
bolts
of
the
rome
gate
were
drawn
back
with
a
great
rattling
of
rusty
old
iron
the
detachment
on
duty
there
accompanied
the
prefect
and
the
colonel
as
a
guard
of
honour
as
they
traversed
the
cours
sauvaire
roudier
related
rougon
s
epic
achievements
to
the
gentlemen
the
three
days
of
panic
that
had
terminated
with
the
brilliant
victory
of
the
previous
night
when
the
two
processions
came
face
to
face
therefore
monsieur
de
bleriot
quickly
advanced
towards
the
president
of
the
commission
shook
hands
with
him
congratulated
him
and
begged
him
to
continue
to
watch
over
the
town
until
the
return
of
the
authorities
rougon
bowed
while
the
prefect
having
reached
the
door
of
the
where
he
wished
to
take
a
brief
rest
proclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
that
he
would
not
forget
to
mention
his
brave
and
noble
conduct
in
his
report
in
the
meantime
in
spite
of
the
bitter
cold
everybody
had
come
to
their
windows
felicite
leaning
forward
at
the
risk
of
falling
out
was
quite
pale
with
joy
aristide
had
just
arrived
with
a
number
of
the
independant
in
which
he
had
openly
declared
himself
in
favour
of
the
coup
d
etat
which
he
welcomed
as
the
aurora
of
liberty
in
order
and
of
order
in
he
had
also
made
a
delicate
allusion
to
the
yellow
acknowledging
his
errors
declaring
that
youth
is
presumptuous
and
that
great
citizens
say
nothing
reflect
in
silence
and
let
insults
pass
by
in
order
to
rise
heroically
when
the
day
of
struggle
he
was
particularly
pleased
with
this
sentence
his
mother
thought
his
article
extremely
well
written
she
kissed
her
dear
child
and
placed
him
on
her
right
hand
the
marquis
de
carnavant
weary
of
incarcerating
himself
and
full
of
eager
curiosity
had
likewise
come
to
see
her
and
stood
on
her
left
leaning
on
the
window
rail
when
monsieur
de
bleriot
offered
his
hand
to
rougon
on
the
square
below
felicite
began
to
weep
oh
see
see
she
said
to
aristide
he
has
shaken
hands
with
him
look
he
is
doing
it
again
and
casting
a
glance
at
the
windows
where
groups
of
people
were
congregated
she
added
how
wild
they
must
be
look
at
monsieur
peirotte
s
wife
she
s
biting
her
handkerchief
and
over
there
the
notary
s
daughter
and
madame
massicot
and
the
brunet
family
what
faces
eh
how
angry
they
look
ah
indeed
it
s
our
turn
she
followed
the
scene
which
was
being
acted
outside
the
with
thrills
of
delight
which
shook
her
ardent
figure
from
head
to
foot
she
interpreted
the
slightest
gesture
invented
words
which
she
was
unable
to
catch
and
declared
that
pierre
bowed
very
well
indeed
she
was
a
little
vexed
when
the
prefect
deigned
to
speak
to
poor
granoux
who
was
hovering
about
him
fishing
for
a
word
of
praise
no
doubt
monsieur
de
bleriot
already
knew
the
story
of
the
hammer
for
the
retired
turned
as
red
as
a
young
girl
and
seemed
to
be
saying
that
he
had
only
done
his
duty
however
that
which
angered
felicite
still
more
was
her
husband
s
excessive
amiability
in
presenting
vuillet
to
the
authorities
vuillet
it
is
true
pushed
himself
forward
amongst
them
and
rougon
was
compelled
to
mention
him
what
a
schemer
muttered
felicite
he
creeps
in
everywhere
how
confused
my
poor
dear
husband
must
be
see
there
s
the
colonel
speaking
to
him
what
can
he
be
saying
to
him
ah
little
one
the
marquis
replied
with
a
touch
of
irony
he
is
complimenting
him
for
having
closed
the
gates
so
my
father
has
saved
the
town
aristide
retorted
curtly
have
you
seen
the
corpses
sir
monsieur
de
carnavant
did
not
answer
he
withdrew
from
the
window
and
sat
down
in
an
shaking
his
head
with
an
air
of
some
disgust
at
that
moment
the
prefect
having
taken
his
departure
rougon
came
upstairs
and
threw
himself
upon
his
wife
s
neck
ah
my
dear
he
stammered
he
was
unable
to
say
more
felicite
made
him
kiss
aristide
after
telling
him
of
the
superb
article
which
the
young
man
had
inserted
in
the
pierre
would
have
kissed
the
marquis
as
well
he
was
deeply
affected
however
his
wife
took
him
aside
and
gave
him
eugene
s
letter
which
she
had
sealed
up
in
an
envelope
again
she
pretended
that
it
had
just
been
delivered
pierre
read
it
and
then
triumphantly
held
it
out
to
her
you
are
a
sorceress
he
said
to
her
laughing
you
guessed
everything
what
folly
i
should
have
committed
without
you
we
ll
manage
our
little
affairs
together
now
kiss
me
you
re
a
good
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
while
she
discreetly
exchanged
a
knowing
smile
with
the
marquis
chapter
vii
it
was
not
until
sunday
the
day
after
the
massacre
at
that
the
troops
passed
through
plassans
again
the
prefect
and
the
colonel
whom
monsieur
garconnet
had
invited
to
dinner
once
more
entered
the
town
alone
the
soldiers
went
round
the
ramparts
and
encamped
in
the
faubourg
on
the
nice
road
night
was
falling
the
sky
overcast
since
the
morning
had
a
strange
yellow
tint
and
illumined
the
town
with
a
murky
light
similar
to
the
glimmer
of
stormy
weather
the
reception
of
the
troops
by
the
inhabitants
was
timid
the
bloodstained
soldiers
who
passed
by
weary
and
silent
in
the
yellow
twilight
horrified
the
cleanly
citizens
promenading
on
the
cours
they
stepped
out
of
the
way
whispering
terrible
stories
of
fusillades
and
revengeful
reprisals
which
still
live
in
the
recollection
of
the
region
the
coup
d
etat
terror
was
beginning
to
make
itself
felt
an
overwhelming
terror
which
kept
the
south
in
a
state
of
tremor
for
many
a
long
month
plassans
in
its
fear
and
hatred
of
the
insurgents
had
welcomed
the
troops
on
their
first
arrival
with
enthusiasm
but
now
at
the
appearance
of
that
gloomy
taciturn
regiment
whose
men
were
ready
to
fire
at
a
word
from
their
officers
the
retired
merchants
and
even
the
notaries
of
the
new
town
anxiously
examined
their
consciences
asking
if
they
had
not
committed
some
political
peccadilloes
which
might
be
thought
deserving
of
a
bullet
the
municipal
authorities
had
returned
on
the
previous
evening
in
a
couple
of
carts
hired
at
their
unexpected
entry
was
devoid
of
all
triumphal
display
rougon
surrendered
the
mayor
s
without
much
regret
the
game
was
over
and
with
feverish
longing
he
now
awaited
the
recompense
for
his
devotion
on
the
sunday
he
had
not
hoped
for
it
until
the
following
day
he
received
a
letter
from
eugene
since
the
previous
thursday
felicite
had
taken
care
to
send
her
son
the
numbers
of
the
gazette
and
independant
which
in
special
second
editions
had
narrated
the
battle
of
the
night
and
the
arrival
of
the
prefect
at
plassans
eugene
now
replied
by
return
of
post
that
the
nomination
of
a
receivership
would
soon
be
signed
but
added
that
he
wished
to
give
them
some
good
news
immediately
he
had
obtained
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honour
for
his
father
felicite
wept
with
joy
her
husband
decorated
her
proud
dream
had
never
gone
as
far
as
that
rougon
pale
with
delight
declared
they
must
give
a
grand
dinner
that
very
evening
he
no
longer
thought
of
expense
he
would
have
thrown
his
last
fifty
francs
out
of
the
windows
in
order
to
celebrate
that
glorious
day
listen
he
said
to
his
wife
you
must
invite
sicardot
he
has
annoyed
me
with
that
rosette
of
his
for
a
long
time
then
granoux
and
roudier
i
shouldn
t
be
at
all
sorry
to
make
them
feel
that
it
isn
t
their
purses
that
will
ever
win
them
the
cross
vuillet
is
a
skinflint
but
the
triumph
ought
to
be
complete
invite
him
as
well
as
the
small
fry
i
was
forgetting
you
must
go
and
call
on
the
marquis
in
person
we
will
seat
him
on
your
right
he
ll
look
very
well
at
our
table
you
know
that
monsieur
garconnet
is
entertaining
the
colonel
and
the
prefect
that
is
to
make
me
understand
that
i
am
nobody
now
but
i
can
afford
to
laugh
at
his
mayoralty
it
doesn
t
bring
him
in
a
sou
he
has
invited
me
but
i
shall
tell
him
that
i
also
have
some
people
coming
the
others
will
laugh
on
the
wrong
side
of
their
mouths
and
let
everything
be
of
the
best
have
everything
sent
from
the
hotel
de
provence
we
must
outdo
the
mayor
s
felicite
set
to
work
pierre
still
felt
some
vague
uneasiness
amidst
his
rapture
the
coup
d
etat
was
going
to
pay
his
debts
his
son
aristide
had
repented
of
his
faults
and
he
was
at
last
freeing
himself
from
macquart
but
he
feared
some
folly
on
pascal
s
part
and
was
especially
anxious
about
the
lot
reserved
for
silvere
not
that
he
felt
the
least
pity
for
the
lad
he
was
simply
afraid
the
matter
of
the
gendarme
might
come
before
the
assize
court
ah
if
only
some
discriminating
bullet
had
managed
to
rid
him
of
that
young
scoundrel
as
his
wife
had
pointed
out
to
him
in
the
morning
all
obstacles
had
fallen
away
before
him
the
family
which
had
dishonoured
him
had
at
the
last
moment
worked
for
his
elevation
his
sons
eugene
and
aristide
those
the
cost
of
whose
college
life
he
had
so
bitterly
regretted
were
at
last
paying
interest
on
the
capital
expended
for
their
education
and
yet
the
thought
of
that
wretched
silvere
must
come
to
mar
his
hour
of
triumph
while
felicite
was
running
about
to
prepare
the
dinner
for
the
evening
pierre
heard
of
the
arrival
of
the
troops
and
determined
to
go
and
make
inquiries
sicardot
whom
he
had
questioned
on
his
return
knew
nothing
pascal
must
have
remained
to
look
after
the
wounded
as
for
silvere
he
had
not
even
been
seen
by
the
commander
who
scarcely
knew
him
rougon
therefore
repaired
to
the
faubourg
intending
to
make
inquiries
there
and
at
the
same
time
pay
macquart
the
eight
hundred
francs
which
he
had
just
succeeded
in
raising
with
great
difficulty
however
when
he
found
himself
in
the
crowded
encampment
and
from
a
distance
saw
the
prisoners
sitting
in
long
files
on
the
beams
in
the
aire
guarded
by
soldiers
gun
in
hand
he
felt
afraid
of
being
compromised
and
so
slunk
off
to
his
mother
s
house
with
the
intention
of
sending
the
old
woman
out
to
pick
up
some
information
when
he
entered
the
hovel
it
was
almost
night
at
first
the
only
person
he
saw
there
was
macquart
smoking
and
drinking
brandy
is
that
you
i
m
glad
of
it
muttered
antoine
i
m
growing
deuced
cold
here
have
you
got
the
money
but
pierre
did
not
reply
he
had
just
perceived
his
son
pascal
leaning
over
the
bed
and
thereupon
he
questioned
him
eagerly
the
doctor
surprised
by
his
uneasiness
which
he
attributed
to
paternal
affection
told
him
that
the
soldiers
had
taken
him
and
would
have
shot
him
had
it
not
been
for
the
intervention
of
some
honest
fellow
whom
he
did
not
know
saved
by
his
profession
of
surgeon
he
had
returned
to
plassans
with
the
troops
this
greatly
relieved
rougon
so
there
was
yet
another
who
would
not
compromise
him
he
was
evincing
his
delight
by
repeated
when
pascal
concluded
in
a
sorrowful
voice
oh
don
t
make
merry
i
have
just
found
my
poor
grandmother
in
a
very
dangerous
state
i
brought
her
back
this
carbine
which
she
values
very
much
i
found
her
lying
here
and
she
has
not
moved
pierre
s
eyes
were
becoming
accustomed
to
the
dimness
in
the
fast
fading
light
he
saw
aunt
dide
stretched
rigid
and
seemingly
lifeless
upon
her
bed
her
wretched
frame
attacked
by
neurosis
from
the
hour
of
birth
was
at
length
laid
prostrate
by
a
supreme
shock
her
nerves
had
so
to
say
consumed
her
blood
moreover
some
cruel
grief
seemed
to
have
suddenly
accelerated
her
slow
her
pale
face
drawn
and
pinched
by
a
life
of
gloom
and
was
now
stained
with
red
blotches
with
convulsed
features
eyes
that
glared
terribly
and
hands
twisted
and
clenched
she
lay
at
full
length
in
her
skirts
which
failed
to
hide
the
sharp
outlines
of
her
scrawny
limbs
extended
there
with
lips
closely
pressed
she
imparted
to
the
dim
room
all
the
horror
of
a
mute
rougon
made
a
gesture
of
vexation
this
spectacle
was
very
distasteful
to
him
he
had
company
coming
to
dinner
in
the
evening
and
it
would
be
extremely
inconvenient
for
him
to
have
to
appear
mournful
his
mother
was
always
doing
something
to
bother
him
she
might
just
as
well
have
chosen
another
day
however
he
put
on
an
appearance
of
perfect
ease
as
he
said
bah
it
s
nothing
i
ve
seen
her
like
that
a
hundred
times
you
must
let
her
lie
still
it
s
the
only
thing
that
does
her
any
pascal
shook
his
head
no
this
fit
isn
t
like
the
others
he
whispered
i
have
often
studied
her
and
have
never
observed
such
symptoms
before
just
look
at
her
eyes
there
is
a
peculiar
fluidity
a
pale
brightness
about
them
which
causes
me
considerable
uneasiness
and
her
face
how
frightfully
every
muscle
of
it
is
distorted
then
bending
over
to
observe
her
features
more
closely
he
continued
in
a
whisper
as
though
speaking
to
himself
i
have
never
seen
such
a
face
excepting
among
people
who
have
been
murdered
or
have
died
from
fright
she
must
have
experienced
some
terrible
but
how
did
the
attack
begin
rougon
impatiently
inquired
at
a
loss
for
an
excuse
to
leave
the
room
pascal
did
not
know
macquart
as
he
poured
himself
out
another
glass
of
brandy
explained
that
he
had
felt
an
inclination
to
drink
a
little
cognac
and
had
sent
her
to
fetch
a
bottle
she
had
not
been
long
absent
and
at
the
very
moment
when
she
returned
she
had
fallen
rigid
on
the
floor
without
uttering
a
word
macquart
himself
had
carried
her
to
the
bed
what
surprises
me
he
said
by
way
of
conclusion
is
that
she
did
not
break
the
the
young
doctor
reflected
after
a
short
pause
he
resumed
i
heard
two
shots
fired
as
i
came
here
perhaps
those
ruffians
have
been
shooting
some
more
prisoners
if
she
passed
through
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
at
that
moment
the
sight
of
blood
may
have
thrown
her
into
this
fit
she
must
have
had
some
dreadful
fortunately
he
had
with
him
the
little
which
he
had
been
carrying
about
ever
since
the
departure
of
the
insurgents
he
tried
to
pour
a
few
drops
of
reddish
liquid
between
aunt
dide
s
teeth
while
macquart
again
asked
his
brother
have
you
got
the
money
yes
i
ve
brought
it
we
ll
settle
now
rougon
replied
glad
of
this
diversion
thereupon
macquart
seeing
that
he
was
about
to
be
paid
began
to
moan
he
had
only
learnt
the
consequence
of
his
treachery
when
it
was
too
late
otherwise
he
would
have
demanded
twice
or
thrice
as
much
and
he
complained
bitterly
really
now
a
thousand
francs
was
not
enough
his
children
had
forsaken
him
he
was
all
alone
in
the
world
and
obliged
to
quit
france
he
almost
wept
as
he
spoke
of
his
coming
exile
come
now
will
you
take
the
eight
hundred
francs
said
rougon
who
was
in
haste
to
be
off
no
certainly
not
double
the
sum
your
wife
cheated
me
if
she
had
told
me
distinctly
what
it
was
she
expected
of
me
i
would
never
have
compromised
myself
for
such
a
rougon
laid
the
eight
hundred
francs
upon
the
table
i
swear
i
haven
t
got
any
more
he
resumed
i
will
think
of
you
later
but
do
for
mercy
s
sake
get
away
this
macquart
cursing
and
muttering
protests
thereupon
carried
the
table
to
the
window
and
began
to
count
the
gold
in
the
fading
twilight
the
coins
tickled
the
tips
of
his
fingers
very
pleasantly
as
he
let
them
fall
and
jingled
musically
in
the
darkness
at
last
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
say
you
promised
to
get
me
a
berth
remember
i
want
to
return
to
france
the
post
of
rural
guard
in
some
pleasant
neighbourhood
which
i
could
mention
would
just
suit
very
well
i
ll
see
about
it
rougon
replied
have
you
got
the
eight
hundred
francs
macquart
resumed
his
counting
the
last
coins
were
just
clinking
when
a
burst
of
laughter
made
them
turn
their
heads
aunt
dide
was
standing
up
in
front
of
the
bed
with
her
bodice
unfastened
her
white
hair
hanging
loose
and
her
face
stained
with
red
blotches
pascal
had
in
vain
endeavoured
to
hold
her
down
trembling
all
over
and
with
her
arms
outstretched
she
shook
her
head
deliriously
the
the
she
again
and
again
repeated
i
heard
the
gold
and
it
is
they
they
who
sold
him
ah
the
murderers
they
are
a
pack
of
then
she
pushed
her
hair
aback
and
passed
her
hand
over
her
brow
as
though
seeking
to
collect
her
thoughts
and
she
continued
ah
i
have
long
seen
him
with
a
in
his
forehead
there
were
always
people
lying
in
wait
for
him
with
guns
they
used
to
sign
to
me
that
they
were
going
to
fire
it
s
terrible
i
feel
some
one
breaking
my
bones
and
battering
out
my
brains
oh
mercy
mercy
i
beseech
you
he
shall
not
see
her
any
more
never
never
i
will
shut
him
up
i
will
prevent
him
from
walking
out
with
her
mercy
mercy
don
t
fire
it
is
not
my
fault
if
you
knew
she
had
almost
fallen
on
her
knees
and
was
weeping
and
entreating
while
she
stretched
her
poor
trembling
hands
towards
some
horrible
vision
which
she
saw
in
the
darkness
then
she
suddenly
rose
upright
and
her
eyes
opened
still
more
widely
as
a
terrible
cry
came
from
her
convulsed
throat
as
though
some
awful
sight
visible
to
her
alone
had
filled
her
with
mad
terror
oh
the
gendarme
she
said
choking
and
falling
backwards
on
the
bed
where
she
rolled
about
breaking
into
long
bursts
of
furious
insane
laughter
pascal
was
studying
the
attack
attentively
the
two
brothers
who
felt
very
frightened
and
only
detected
snatches
of
what
their
mother
said
had
taken
refuge
in
a
corner
of
the
room
when
rougon
heard
the
word
gendarme
he
thought
he
understood
her
ever
since
the
murder
of
her
lover
the
elder
macquart
on
the
frontier
aunt
dide
had
cherished
a
bitter
hatred
against
all
gendarmes
and
officers
whom
she
mingled
together
in
one
common
longing
for
vengeance
why
it
s
the
story
of
the
poacher
that
she
s
telling
us
he
whispered
but
pascal
made
a
sign
to
him
to
keep
quiet
the
stricken
woman
had
raised
herself
with
difficulty
and
was
looking
round
her
with
a
stupefied
air
she
remained
silent
for
a
moment
endeavouring
to
recognise
the
various
objects
in
the
room
as
though
she
were
in
some
strange
place
then
with
a
sudden
expression
of
anxiety
she
asked
where
is
the
gun
the
doctor
put
the
carbine
into
her
hands
at
this
she
raised
a
light
cry
of
joy
and
gazed
at
the
weapon
saying
in
a
soft
girlish
whisper
that
is
it
oh
i
recognise
it
it
is
all
stained
with
blood
the
stains
are
quite
fresh
his
red
hands
have
left
marks
of
blood
on
the
butt
ah
poor
poor
aunt
dide
then
she
became
dizzy
once
more
and
lapsed
into
silent
thought
the
gendarme
was
dead
she
murmured
at
last
but
i
have
seen
him
again
he
has
come
back
they
never
die
those
blackguards
again
did
gloomy
passion
come
over
her
and
shaking
the
carbine
she
advanced
towards
her
two
sons
who
speechless
with
fright
retreated
to
the
very
wall
her
loosened
skirts
trailed
along
the
ground
as
she
drew
up
her
twisted
frame
which
age
had
reduced
to
mere
bones
it
s
you
who
fired
she
cried
i
heard
the
gold
wretched
woman
that
i
am
i
brought
nothing
but
wolves
into
the
world
a
whole
family
a
whole
litter
of
wolves
there
was
only
one
poor
lad
and
him
they
have
devoured
each
had
a
bite
at
him
and
their
lips
are
covered
with
blood
ah
the
accursed
villains
they
have
robbed
they
have
murdered
and
they
live
like
gentlemen
villains
accursed
villains
she
sang
laughed
cried
and
repeated
accursed
villains
in
strangely
sonorous
tones
which
suggested
a
crackling
of
a
fusillade
pascal
with
tears
in
his
eyes
took
her
in
his
arms
and
laid
her
on
the
bed
again
she
submitted
like
a
child
but
persisted
in
her
wailing
cries
accelerating
their
rhythm
and
beating
time
on
the
sheet
with
her
withered
hands
that
s
just
what
i
was
afraid
of
the
doctor
said
she
is
mad
the
blow
has
been
too
heavy
for
a
poor
creature
already
subject
as
she
is
to
acute
neurosis
she
will
die
in
a
lunatic
asylum
like
her
but
what
could
she
have
seen
asked
rougon
at
last
venturing
to
quit
the
corner
where
he
had
hidden
himself
i
have
a
terrible
suspicion
pascal
replied
i
was
going
to
speak
to
you
about
silvere
when
you
came
in
he
is
a
prisoner
you
must
endeavour
to
obtain
his
release
from
the
prefect
if
there
is
still
the
old
turned
pale
as
he
looked
at
his
son
then
rapidly
he
responded
listen
to
me
you
stay
here
and
watch
her
i
m
too
busy
this
evening
we
will
see
about
conveying
her
to
the
lunatic
asylum
at
les
tulettes
as
for
you
macquart
you
must
leave
this
very
night
swear
to
me
that
you
will
i
m
going
to
find
monsieur
de
he
stammered
as
he
spoke
and
felt
more
eager
than
ever
to
get
out
into
the
fresh
air
of
the
streets
pascal
fixed
a
penetrating
look
on
the
madwoman
and
then
on
his
father
and
uncle
his
professional
instinct
was
getting
the
better
of
him
and
he
studied
the
mother
and
the
sons
with
all
the
keenness
of
a
naturalist
observing
the
metamorphosis
of
some
insect
he
pondered
over
the
growth
of
that
family
to
which
he
belonged
over
the
different
branches
growing
from
one
parent
stock
whose
sap
carried
identical
germs
to
the
farthest
twigs
which
bent
in
divers
ways
according
to
the
sunshine
or
shade
in
which
they
lived
and
for
a
moment
as
by
the
glow
of
a
lightning
flash
he
thought
he
could
espy
the
future
of
the
family
a
pack
of
unbridled
insatiate
appetites
amidst
a
blaze
of
gold
and
blood
aunt
dide
however
had
ceased
her
wailing
chant
at
the
mention
of
silvere
s
name
for
a
moment
she
listened
anxiously
then
she
broke
out
into
terrible
shrieks
night
had
now
completely
fallen
and
the
black
room
seemed
void
and
horrible
the
shrieks
of
the
madwoman
who
was
no
longer
visible
rang
out
from
the
darkness
as
from
a
grave
rougon
losing
his
head
took
to
flight
pursued
by
those
taunting
cries
whose
bitterness
seemed
to
increase
amidst
the
gloom
as
he
was
emerging
from
the
impasse
with
hesitating
steps
wondering
whether
it
would
not
be
dangerous
to
solicit
silvere
s
pardon
from
the
prefect
he
saw
aristide
prowling
about
the
the
latter
recognising
his
father
ran
up
to
him
with
an
expression
of
anxiety
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
pierre
turned
pale
and
cast
a
look
of
alarm
towards
the
end
of
the
yard
where
the
darkness
was
only
relieved
by
the
ruddy
glow
of
a
little
gipsy
fire
then
they
both
disappeared
down
the
rue
de
rome
quickening
their
steps
as
though
they
had
committed
a
murder
and
turning
up
their
in
order
that
they
might
not
be
recognised
that
saves
me
an
errand
rougon
whispered
let
us
go
to
dinner
they
are
waiting
for
when
they
arrived
the
yellow
was
resplendent
felicite
was
all
over
the
place
everybody
was
there
sicardot
granoux
roudier
vuillet
the
the
the
whole
set
the
marquis
however
had
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
rheumatism
and
besides
he
was
about
to
leave
plassans
on
a
short
trip
those
bloodstained
bourgeois
offended
his
feelings
of
delicacy
and
moreover
his
relative
the
count
de
valqueyras
had
begged
him
to
withdraw
from
public
notice
for
a
little
time
monsieur
de
carnavant
s
refusal
vexed
the
rougons
but
felicite
consoled
herself
by
resolving
to
make
a
more
profuse
display
she
hired
a
pair
of
candelabra
and
ordered
several
additional
dishes
as
a
kind
of
substitute
for
the
marquis
the
table
was
laid
in
the
yellow
in
order
to
impart
more
solemnity
to
the
occasion
the
hotel
de
provence
had
supplied
the
silver
the
china
and
the
glass
the
cloth
had
been
laid
ever
since
five
o
clock
in
order
that
the
guests
on
arriving
might
feast
their
eyes
upon
it
at
either
end
of
the
table
on
the
white
cloth
were
bouquets
of
artificial
roses
in
porcelain
vases
gilded
and
painted
with
flowers
when
the
habitual
guests
of
the
yellow
were
assembled
there
they
could
not
conceal
their
admiration
of
the
spectacle
several
gentlemen
smiled
with
an
air
of
embarrassment
while
they
exchanged
furtive
glances
which
clearly
signified
these
rougons
are
mad
they
are
throwing
their
money
out
of
the
the
truth
was
that
felicite
on
going
round
to
invite
her
guests
had
been
unable
to
hold
her
tongue
so
everybody
knew
that
pierre
had
been
decorated
and
that
he
was
about
to
be
nominated
to
some
post
at
which
of
course
they
pulled
wry
faces
roudier
indeed
observed
that
the
little
black
woman
was
puffing
herself
out
too
now
that
had
come
this
band
of
bourgeois
who
had
rushed
upon
the
expiring
republic
each
one
keeping
an
eye
on
the
other
and
glorying
in
giving
a
deeper
bite
than
his
neighbour
did
not
think
it
fair
that
their
hosts
should
have
all
the
laurels
of
the
battle
even
those
who
had
merely
howled
by
instinct
asking
no
recompense
of
the
rising
empire
were
greatly
annoyed
to
see
that
thanks
to
them
the
poorest
and
least
reputable
of
them
all
should
be
decorated
with
the
red
ribbon
the
whole
yellow
ought
to
have
been
decorated
not
that
i
value
the
decoration
roudier
said
to
granoux
whom
he
had
dragged
into
the
embrasure
of
a
window
i
refused
it
in
the
time
of
when
i
was
purveyor
to
the
court
ah
was
a
good
king
france
will
never
find
his
equal
roudier
was
becoming
an
orleanist
once
more
and
he
added
with
the
crafty
hypocrisy
of
an
old
hosier
from
the
rue
but
you
my
dear
granoux
don
t
you
think
the
ribbon
would
look
well
in
your
after
all
you
did
as
much
to
save
the
town
as
rougon
did
yesterday
when
i
was
calling
upon
some
very
distinguished
persons
they
could
scarcely
believe
it
possible
that
you
had
made
so
much
noise
with
a
mere
granoux
stammered
his
thanks
and
blushing
like
a
maiden
at
her
first
confession
of
love
whispered
in
roudier
s
ear
don
t
say
anything
about
it
but
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
rougon
will
ask
the
ribbon
for
me
he
s
a
good
fellow
at
heart
you
the
old
hosier
thereupon
became
grave
and
assumed
a
very
affable
manner
when
vuillet
came
and
spoke
to
him
of
the
reward
that
their
friend
had
just
received
he
replied
in
a
loud
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
by
felicite
who
was
sitting
a
little
way
off
that
men
like
rougon
were
an
ornament
to
the
legion
of
the
bookseller
joined
in
the
chorus
he
had
that
morning
received
a
formal
assurance
that
the
custom
of
the
college
would
be
restored
to
him
as
for
sicardot
he
at
first
felt
somewhat
annoyed
to
find
himself
no
longer
the
only
one
of
the
set
who
was
decorated
according
to
him
none
but
soldiers
had
a
right
to
the
ribbon
pierre
s
valour
surprised
him
however
being
in
reality
a
fellow
he
at
last
grew
warmer
and
ended
by
saying
that
the
napoleons
always
knew
how
to
distinguish
men
of
spirit
and
energy
rougon
and
aristide
consequently
had
an
enthusiastic
reception
on
their
arrival
all
hands
were
held
out
to
them
some
of
the
guests
went
so
far
as
to
embrace
them
angele
sat
on
the
sofa
by
the
side
of
her
feeling
very
happy
and
gazing
at
the
table
with
the
astonishment
of
a
gourmand
who
has
never
seen
so
many
dishes
at
once
when
aristide
approached
sicardot
complimented
his
upon
his
superb
article
in
the
he
restored
his
friendship
to
him
the
young
man
in
answer
to
the
fatherly
questions
which
sicardot
addressed
to
him
replied
that
he
was
anxious
to
take
his
little
family
with
him
to
paris
where
his
brother
eugene
would
push
him
forward
but
he
was
in
want
of
five
hundred
francs
sicardot
thereupon
promised
him
the
money
already
foreseeing
the
day
when
his
daughter
would
be
received
at
the
tuileries
by
napoleon
iii
in
the
meantime
felicite
had
made
a
sign
to
her
husband
pierre
surrounded
by
everybody
and
anxiously
questioned
about
his
pallor
could
only
escape
for
a
minute
he
was
just
able
to
whisper
in
his
wife
s
ear
that
he
had
found
pascal
and
that
macquart
would
leave
that
night
then
lowering
his
voice
still
more
he
told
her
of
his
mother
s
insanity
and
placed
his
finger
on
his
lips
as
if
to
say
not
a
word
that
would
spoil
the
whole
felicite
bit
her
lips
they
exchanged
a
look
in
which
they
read
their
common
thoughts
so
now
the
old
woman
would
not
trouble
them
any
more
the
poacher
s
hovel
would
be
razed
to
the
ground
as
the
walls
of
the
fouques
enclosure
had
been
demolished
and
they
would
for
ever
enjoy
the
respect
and
esteem
of
plassans
but
the
guests
were
looking
at
the
table
felicite
showed
the
gentlemen
their
seats
it
was
perfect
bliss
as
each
one
took
his
spoon
sicardot
made
a
gesture
to
solicit
a
moment
s
delay
then
he
rose
and
gravely
said
gentlemen
on
behalf
of
the
company
present
i
wish
to
express
to
our
host
how
pleased
we
are
at
the
rewards
which
his
courage
and
patriotism
have
procured
for
him
i
now
see
that
he
must
have
acted
upon
a
inspiration
in
remaining
here
while
those
beggars
were
dragging
myself
and
others
along
the
high
roads
therefore
i
heartily
applaud
the
decision
of
the
government
let
me
finish
you
can
then
congratulate
our
friend
know
then
that
our
friend
besides
being
made
a
chevalier
of
the
legion
of
honour
is
also
to
be
appointed
to
a
receiver
of
there
was
a
cry
of
surprise
they
had
expected
a
small
post
some
of
them
tried
to
force
a
smile
but
aided
by
the
sight
of
the
table
the
compliments
again
poured
forth
profusely
sicardot
once
more
begged
for
silence
wait
one
moment
he
resumed
i
have
not
finished
just
one
word
it
is
probable
that
our
friend
will
remain
among
us
owing
to
the
death
of
monsieur
whilst
the
guests
burst
out
into
exclamations
felicite
felt
a
keen
pain
in
her
heart
sicardot
had
already
told
her
that
the
receiver
had
been
shot
but
at
the
mention
of
that
sudden
and
shocking
death
just
as
they
were
starting
on
that
triumphal
dinner
it
seemed
as
if
a
chilling
gust
swept
past
her
face
she
remembered
her
wish
it
was
she
who
had
killed
that
man
however
amidst
the
tinkling
music
of
the
silver
the
company
began
to
do
honour
to
the
banquet
in
the
provinces
people
eat
very
much
and
very
noisily
by
the
time
the
was
served
the
gentlemen
were
all
talking
together
they
showered
kicks
upon
the
vanquished
flattered
one
another
and
made
disparaging
remarks
about
the
absence
of
the
marquis
it
was
impossible
they
said
to
maintain
intercourse
with
the
nobility
roudier
even
gave
out
that
the
marquis
had
begged
to
be
excused
because
his
fear
of
the
insurgents
had
given
him
jaundice
at
the
second
course
they
all
scrambled
like
hounds
at
the
quarry
the
and
were
the
men
who
saved
france
they
clinked
glasses
to
the
glory
of
the
rougons
granoux
who
was
very
red
began
to
stammer
while
vuillet
very
pale
was
quite
drunk
nevertheless
sicardot
continued
filling
his
glass
for
her
part
angele
who
had
already
eaten
too
much
prepared
herself
some
sugar
and
water
the
gentlemen
were
so
delighted
at
being
freed
from
panic
and
finding
themselves
together
again
in
that
yellow
round
a
good
table
in
the
bright
light
radiating
from
the
candelabra
and
the
chandelier
which
they
now
saw
for
the
first
time
without
its
cover
that
they
gave
way
to
most
exuberant
folly
and
indulged
in
the
coarsest
enjoyment
their
voices
rose
in
the
warm
atmosphere
more
huskily
and
eulogistically
at
each
successive
dish
till
they
could
scarcely
invent
fresh
compliments
however
one
of
them
an
old
retired
hit
upon
this
fine
phrase
that
the
dinner
was
a
perfect
feast
worthy
of
pierre
was
radiant
and
his
big
pale
face
perspired
with
triumph
felicite
already
accustoming
herself
to
her
new
station
in
life
said
that
they
would
probably
rent
poor
monsieur
peirotte
s
flat
until
they
could
purchase
a
house
of
their
own
in
the
new
town
she
was
already
planning
how
she
would
place
her
future
furniture
in
the
receiver
s
rooms
she
was
entering
into
possession
of
her
tuileries
at
one
moment
however
as
the
uproar
of
voices
became
deafening
she
seemed
to
recollect
something
and
quitting
her
seat
she
whispered
in
aristide
s
ear
and
silvere
the
young
man
started
with
surprise
at
the
question
he
is
dead
he
replied
likewise
in
a
whisper
i
was
there
when
the
gendarme
blew
his
brains
out
with
a
felicite
in
her
turn
shuddered
she
opened
her
mouth
to
ask
her
son
why
he
had
not
prevented
this
murder
by
claiming
the
lad
but
abruptly
hesitating
she
remained
there
speechless
then
aristide
who
had
read
her
question
on
her
quivering
lips
whispered
you
understand
i
said
nothing
so
much
the
worse
for
him
i
did
quite
right
it
s
a
good
this
brutal
frankness
displeased
felicite
so
aristide
had
his
skeleton
like
his
father
and
mother
he
would
certainly
not
have
confessed
so
openly
that
he
had
been
strolling
about
the
faubourg
and
had
allowed
his
cousin
to
be
shot
had
not
the
wine
from
the
hotel
de
provence
and
the
dreams
he
was
building
upon
his
approaching
arrival
in
paris
made
him
depart
from
his
habitual
cunning
the
words
once
spoken
he
swung
himself
to
and
fro
on
his
chair
pierre
who
had
watched
the
conversation
between
his
wife
and
son
from
a
distance
understood
what
had
passed
and
glanced
at
them
like
an
accomplice
imploring
silence
it
was
the
last
blast
of
terror
as
it
were
which
blew
over
the
rougons
amidst
the
splendour
and
enthusiastic
merriment
of
the
dinner
true
felicite
on
returning
to
her
seat
espied
a
taper
burning
behind
a
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
some
one
sat
watching
monsieur
peirotte
s
corpse
which
had
been
brought
back
from
that
morning
she
sat
down
feeling
as
if
that
taper
were
heating
her
back
but
the
gaiety
was
now
increasing
and
exclamations
of
rapture
rang
through
the
yellow
when
the
dessert
appeared
at
that
same
hour
the
faubourg
was
still
shuddering
at
the
tragedy
which
had
just
stained
the
aire
with
blood
the
return
of
the
troops
after
the
carnage
on
the
nores
plain
had
been
marked
by
the
most
cruel
reprisals
men
were
beaten
to
death
behind
bits
of
wall
with
the
of
muskets
others
had
their
brains
blown
out
in
ravines
by
the
pistols
of
gendarmes
in
order
that
terror
might
impose
silence
the
soldiers
strewed
their
road
with
corpses
one
might
have
followed
them
by
the
red
trail
which
they
left
behind
it
was
a
long
butchery
at
every
a
few
insurgents
were
massacred
two
were
killed
at
three
at
ocheres
one
at
beage
when
the
troops
were
encamped
at
plassans
on
the
nice
road
it
was
decided
that
one
more
prisoner
the
most
guilty
should
be
shot
the
victors
judged
it
wise
to
leave
this
fresh
corpse
behind
them
in
order
to
inspire
the
town
with
respect
for
the
empire
but
the
soldiers
were
now
weary
of
killing
none
offered
himself
for
the
fatal
task
the
prisoners
thrown
on
the
beams
in
the
as
though
on
a
camp
bed
and
bound
together
in
pairs
by
the
hands
listened
and
waited
in
a
state
of
weary
resigned
stupor
though
zola
has
changed
his
place
in
his
account
of
the
insurrection
that
account
is
strictly
accurate
in
all
its
chief
particulars
what
he
says
of
the
savagery
both
of
the
soldiers
and
of
their
officers
is
confirmed
by
all
impartial
historical
editor
at
that
moment
the
gendarme
rengade
roughly
opened
a
way
for
himself
through
the
crowd
of
inquisitive
idlers
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
the
troops
had
returned
with
several
hundred
insurgents
he
had
risen
from
bed
shivering
with
fever
and
risking
his
life
in
the
cold
dark
december
air
scarcely
was
he
out
of
doors
when
his
wound
reopened
the
bandage
which
covered
his
eyeless
socket
became
stained
with
blood
and
a
red
streamlet
trickled
over
his
cheek
and
moustache
he
looked
frightful
in
his
dumb
fury
with
his
pale
face
and
bandage
as
he
ran
along
closely
scrutinising
each
of
the
prisoners
he
followed
the
beams
bending
down
and
going
to
and
fro
making
the
bravest
shudder
by
his
abrupt
appearance
and
all
of
a
sudden
ah
the
bandit
i
ve
got
him
he
cried
he
had
just
laid
his
hand
on
silvere
s
shoulder
silvere
crouching
down
on
a
beam
with
lifeless
and
expressionless
face
was
looking
straight
before
him
into
the
pale
twilight
with
a
calm
stupefied
air
ever
since
his
departure
from
he
had
retained
that
vacant
stare
along
the
high
road
for
many
a
league
whenever
the
soldiers
urged
on
the
march
of
their
captives
with
the
of
their
rifles
he
had
shown
himself
as
gentle
as
a
child
covered
with
dust
thirsty
and
weary
he
trudged
onward
without
saying
a
word
like
one
of
those
docile
animals
that
herdsmen
drive
along
he
was
thinking
of
miette
he
ever
saw
her
lying
on
the
banner
under
the
trees
with
her
eyes
turned
upwards
for
three
days
he
had
seen
none
but
her
and
at
this
very
moment
amidst
the
growing
darkness
he
still
saw
her
rengade
turned
towards
the
officer
who
had
failed
to
find
among
the
soldiers
the
requisite
men
for
an
execution
this
villain
put
my
eye
out
he
said
pointing
to
silvere
hand
him
over
to
me
it
s
as
good
as
done
for
the
officer
did
not
reply
in
words
but
withdrew
with
an
air
of
indifference
making
a
vague
gesture
the
gendarme
understood
that
the
man
was
surrendered
to
him
come
get
up
he
resumed
as
he
shook
him
silvere
like
all
the
other
prisoners
had
a
companion
attached
to
him
he
was
fastened
by
the
arm
to
a
peasant
of
poujols
named
mourgue
a
man
about
fifty
who
had
been
brutified
by
the
scorching
sun
and
the
hard
labour
of
tilling
the
ground
already
his
hands
hardened
his
face
coarse
and
heavy
he
blinked
his
eyes
in
a
stupid
manner
with
the
stubborn
distrustful
expression
of
an
animal
subject
to
the
lash
he
had
set
out
armed
with
a
pitchfork
because
his
fellow
villagers
had
done
so
but
he
could
not
have
explained
what
had
thus
set
him
adrift
on
the
high
roads
since
he
had
been
made
a
prisoner
he
understood
it
still
less
he
had
some
vague
idea
that
he
was
being
conveyed
home
his
amazement
at
finding
himself
bound
the
sight
of
all
the
people
staring
at
him
stupefied
him
still
more
as
he
only
spoke
and
understood
the
dialect
of
the
region
he
could
not
imagine
what
the
gendarme
wanted
he
raised
his
coarse
heavy
face
towards
him
with
an
effort
then
fancying
he
was
being
asked
the
name
of
his
village
he
said
in
his
hoarse
voice
i
come
from
a
burst
of
laughter
ran
through
the
crowd
and
some
voices
cried
release
the
bah
rengade
replied
the
more
of
this
vermin
that
s
crushed
the
better
as
they
re
together
they
can
both
there
was
a
murmur
but
the
gendarme
turned
his
terrible
face
upon
the
onlookers
and
they
slunk
off
one
cleanly
little
citizen
went
away
declaring
that
if
he
remained
any
longer
it
would
spoil
his
appetite
for
dinner
however
some
boys
who
recognised
silvere
began
to
speak
of
the
red
thereupon
the
little
citizen
retraced
his
steps
in
order
to
see
the
lover
of
the
female
that
depraved
creature
who
had
been
mentioned
in
the
silvere
for
his
part
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
rengade
had
to
seize
him
by
the
collar
thereupon
he
got
up
forcing
mourgue
to
rise
also
come
said
the
gendarme
it
won
t
take
silvere
then
recognised
the
man
he
smiled
he
must
have
understood
but
he
turned
his
head
away
the
sight
of
the
man
of
his
moustaches
which
congealed
blood
stiffened
as
with
sinister
rime
caused
him
profound
grief
he
would
have
liked
to
die
in
perfect
peace
so
he
avoided
the
gaze
of
rengade
s
one
eye
which
glared
from
beneath
the
white
bandage
and
of
his
own
accord
he
proceeded
to
the
end
of
the
aire
to
the
narrow
lane
hidden
by
the
timber
stacks
mourgue
followed
him
thither
the
aire
stretched
out
with
an
aspect
of
desolation
under
the
sallow
sky
a
murky
light
fell
here
and
there
from
the
clouds
never
had
a
sadder
and
more
lingering
twilight
cast
its
melancholy
over
this
bare
expanse
this
with
its
slumbering
timber
so
stiff
and
rigid
in
the
cold
the
prisoners
the
soldiers
and
the
mob
along
the
high
road
disappeared
amid
the
darkness
of
the
trees
the
expanse
the
beams
the
piles
of
planks
alone
grew
pale
under
the
fading
light
assuming
a
muddy
tint
that
vaguely
suggested
the
bed
of
a
torrent
the
sawyers
trestles
rearing
their
meagre
framework
in
a
corner
seemed
to
form
gallows
or
the
uprights
of
a
guillotine
and
there
was
no
living
soul
there
excepting
three
gipsies
who
showed
their
frightened
faces
at
the
door
of
their
van
an
old
man
and
woman
and
a
big
girl
with
woolly
hair
whose
eyes
gleamed
like
those
of
a
wolf
before
reaching
the
secluded
path
silvere
looked
round
him
he
bethought
himself
of
a
far
away
sunday
when
he
had
crossed
the
in
the
bright
moonlight
how
calm
and
soft
it
had
been
how
slowly
had
the
pale
rays
passed
over
the
beams
supreme
silence
had
fallen
from
the
frozen
sky
and
amidst
this
silence
the
gipsy
girl
had
sung
in
a
low
key
and
an
unknown
tongue
then
silvere
remembered
that
the
seemingly
sunday
was
only
a
week
old
but
a
week
ago
he
had
come
to
bid
miette
farewell
how
long
past
it
seemed
he
felt
as
though
he
had
not
set
foot
in
the
for
years
but
when
he
reached
the
narrow
path
his
heart
failed
him
he
recognised
the
odour
of
the
grass
the
shadows
of
the
planks
the
holes
in
the
wall
a
woeful
voice
rose
from
all
those
things
the
path
stretched
out
sad
and
lonely
it
seemed
longer
to
him
than
usual
and
he
felt
a
cold
wind
blowing
down
it
the
spot
had
aged
cruelly
he
saw
that
the
wall
was
that
the
verdant
carpet
was
dried
up
by
frost
that
the
piles
of
timber
had
been
rotted
by
rain
it
was
perfect
devastation
the
yellow
twilight
fell
like
fine
dust
upon
the
ruins
of
all
that
had
been
most
dear
to
him
he
was
obliged
to
close
his
eyes
that
he
might
again
behold
the
lane
green
and
live
his
happy
hours
afresh
it
was
warm
weather
and
he
was
racing
with
miette
in
the
balmy
air
then
the
cruel
december
rains
fell
unceasingly
yet
they
still
came
there
sheltering
themselves
beneath
the
planks
and
listening
with
rapture
to
the
heavy
plashing
of
the
shower
his
whole
life
all
his
happiness
passed
before
him
like
a
flash
of
lightning
miette
was
climbing
over
the
wall
running
to
him
shaking
with
sonorous
laughter
she
was
there
he
could
see
her
gleaming
white
through
the
darkness
with
her
living
helm
of
hair
she
was
talking
about
the
magpies
nests
which
are
so
difficult
to
steal
and
she
dragged
him
along
with
her
then
he
heard
the
gentle
murmur
of
the
viorne
in
the
distance
the
chirping
of
the
belated
grasshoppers
and
the
blowing
of
the
breeze
among
the
poplars
in
the
meadows
of
ah
how
they
used
to
run
how
well
he
remembered
it
she
had
learnt
to
swim
in
a
fortnight
she
was
a
plucky
girl
she
had
only
had
one
great
fault
she
was
inclined
to
pilfering
but
he
would
have
cured
her
of
that
then
the
thought
of
their
first
embraces
brought
him
back
to
the
narrow
path
they
had
always
ended
by
returning
to
that
nook
he
fancied
he
could
hear
the
gipsy
girl
s
song
dying
away
the
creaking
of
the
last
shutters
the
solemn
striking
of
the
clocks
then
the
hour
of
separation
came
and
miette
climbed
the
wall
again
and
threw
him
a
kiss
and
he
saw
her
no
more
emotion
choked
him
at
the
thought
he
would
never
see
her
again
never
when
you
re
ready
jeered
the
man
come
choose
your
silvere
took
a
few
more
steps
he
was
approaching
the
end
of
the
path
and
could
see
nothing
but
a
strip
of
sky
in
which
the
light
was
fading
away
here
had
he
spent
his
life
for
two
years
past
the
slow
approach
of
death
added
an
ineffable
charm
to
this
pathway
which
had
so
long
served
as
a
lovers
walk
he
loitered
bidding
a
long
and
lingering
farewell
to
all
he
loved
the
grass
the
timber
the
stone
of
the
old
wall
all
those
things
into
which
miette
had
breathed
life
and
again
his
thoughts
wandered
they
were
waiting
till
they
should
be
old
enough
to
marry
aunt
dide
would
remain
with
them
ah
if
they
had
fled
far
away
very
far
away
to
some
unknown
village
where
the
scamps
of
the
faubourg
would
no
longer
have
been
able
to
come
and
cast
chantegreil
s
crime
in
his
daughter
s
face
what
peaceful
bliss
they
would
have
opened
a
wheelwright
s
workshop
beside
some
high
road
no
doubt
he
cared
little
for
his
ambitions
now
he
no
longer
thought
of
coachmaking
of
carriages
with
broad
varnished
panels
as
shiny
as
mirrors
in
the
stupor
of
his
despair
he
could
not
remember
why
his
dream
of
bliss
would
never
come
to
pass
why
did
he
not
go
away
with
miette
and
aunt
dide
then
as
he
racked
his
memory
he
heard
the
sharp
crackling
of
a
fusillade
he
saw
a
standard
fall
before
him
its
staff
broken
and
its
folds
drooping
like
the
wings
of
a
bird
brought
down
by
a
shot
it
was
the
republic
falling
asleep
with
miette
under
the
red
flag
ah
what
wretchedness
they
were
both
dead
both
had
bleeding
wounds
in
their
breasts
and
it
was
they
the
corpses
of
his
two
loves
that
now
barred
his
path
of
life
he
had
nothing
left
him
and
might
well
die
himself
these
were
the
thoughts
that
had
made
him
so
gentle
so
listless
so
childlike
all
the
way
from
the
soldiers
might
have
struck
him
he
would
not
have
felt
it
his
spirit
no
longer
inhabited
his
body
it
was
far
away
prostrate
beside
the
loved
ones
who
were
dead
under
the
trees
amidst
the
pungent
smoke
of
the
gunpowder
but
the
man
was
growing
impatient
giving
a
push
to
mourgue
who
was
lagging
behind
he
growled
get
along
do
i
don
t
want
to
be
here
all
silvere
stumbled
he
looked
at
his
feet
a
fragment
of
a
skull
lay
whitening
in
the
grass
he
thought
he
heard
a
murmur
of
voices
filling
the
pathway
the
dead
were
calling
him
those
long
departed
ones
whose
warm
breath
had
so
strangely
perturbed
him
and
his
sweetheart
during
the
sultry
july
evenings
he
recognised
their
low
whispers
they
were
rejoicing
they
were
telling
him
to
come
and
promising
to
restore
miette
to
him
beneath
the
earth
in
some
retreat
which
would
prove
still
more
sequestered
than
this
old
the
cemetery
whose
oppressive
odours
and
dark
vegetation
had
breathed
eager
desire
into
the
children
s
hearts
while
alluringly
spreading
out
its
couches
of
rank
grass
without
succeeding
however
in
throwing
them
into
one
another
s
arms
now
longed
to
imbibe
silvere
s
warm
blood
for
two
summers
past
it
had
been
expecting
the
young
lovers
is
it
here
asked
the
man
silvere
looked
in
front
of
him
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
path
his
eyes
fell
on
the
tombstone
and
he
started
miette
was
right
that
stone
was
for
her
here
lieth
marie
died
she
was
dead
that
slab
had
fallen
over
her
his
strength
failing
him
he
leant
against
the
frozen
stone
how
warm
it
had
been
when
they
sat
in
that
nook
chatting
for
many
a
long
evening
she
had
always
come
that
way
and
the
pressure
of
her
foot
as
she
alighted
from
the
wall
had
worn
away
the
stone
s
surface
in
one
corner
the
mark
seemed
instinct
with
something
of
her
lissom
figure
and
to
silvere
it
appeared
as
if
some
fatalism
attached
to
all
these
objects
as
if
the
stone
were
there
precisely
in
order
that
he
might
come
to
die
beside
it
there
where
he
had
loved
the
man
cocked
his
pistols
death
death
the
thought
fascinated
silvere
it
was
to
this
spot
then
that
they
had
led
him
by
the
long
white
road
which
descends
from
to
plassans
if
he
had
known
it
he
would
have
hastened
on
yet
more
quickly
in
order
to
die
on
that
stone
at
the
end
of
the
narrow
path
in
the
atmosphere
where
he
could
still
detect
the
scent
of
miette
s
breath
never
had
he
hoped
for
such
consolation
in
his
grief
heaven
was
merciful
he
waited
a
vague
smile
playing
on
is
face
mourgue
meantime
had
caught
sight
of
the
pistols
hitherto
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
dragged
along
stupidly
but
fear
now
overcame
him
and
he
repeated
in
a
tone
of
despair
i
come
from
poujols
i
come
from
poujols
then
he
threw
himself
on
the
ground
rolling
at
the
gendarme
s
feet
breaking
out
into
prayers
for
mercy
and
imagining
that
he
was
being
mistaken
for
some
one
else
what
does
it
matter
to
me
that
you
come
from
poujols
rengade
muttered
and
as
the
wretched
man
shivering
and
crying
with
terror
and
quite
unable
to
understand
why
he
was
going
to
die
held
out
his
trembling
hands
his
deformed
hard
labourer
s
hands
exclaiming
in
his
patois
that
he
had
done
nothing
and
ought
to
be
pardoned
the
man
grew
quite
exasperated
at
being
unable
to
put
the
pistol
to
his
temple
owing
to
his
constant
movements
will
you
hold
your
tongue
he
shouted
thereupon
mourgue
mad
with
fright
and
unwilling
to
die
began
to
howl
like
a
beast
like
a
pig
that
is
being
slaughtered
hold
your
tongue
you
scoundrel
the
gendarme
repeated
and
he
blew
his
brains
out
the
peasant
fell
with
a
thud
his
body
rolled
to
the
foot
of
a
where
it
remained
doubled
up
the
violence
of
the
shock
had
severed
the
rope
which
fastened
him
to
his
companion
silvere
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
tombstone
it
was
to
make
his
vengeance
the
more
terrible
that
rengade
had
killed
mourgue
first
he
played
with
his
second
pistol
raising
it
slowly
in
order
to
relish
silvere
s
agony
but
the
latter
looked
at
him
quietly
then
again
the
sight
of
this
man
with
the
one
fierce
scorching
eye
made
him
feel
uneasy
he
averted
his
glance
fearing
that
he
might
die
cowardly
if
he
continued
to
look
at
that
feverishly
quivering
gendarme
with
bandage
and
bleeding
moustache
however
as
he
raised
his
eyes
to
avoid
him
he
perceived
justin
s
head
just
above
the
wall
at
the
very
spot
where
miette
had
been
wont
to
leap
over
justin
had
been
at
the
porte
de
rome
among
the
crowd
when
the
gendarme
had
led
the
prisoners
away
he
had
set
off
as
fast
as
he
could
by
way
of
the
in
his
eagerness
to
witness
the
execution
the
thought
that
he
alone
of
all
the
faubourg
scamps
would
view
the
tragedy
at
his
ease
as
from
a
balcony
made
him
run
so
quickly
that
he
twice
fell
down
and
in
spite
of
his
wild
chase
he
arrived
too
late
to
witness
the
first
shot
he
climbed
the
mulberry
tree
in
despair
but
he
smiled
when
he
saw
that
silvere
still
remained
the
soldiers
had
informed
him
of
his
cousin
s
death
and
now
the
murder
of
the
wheelwright
brought
his
happiness
to
a
climax
he
awaited
the
shot
with
that
delight
which
the
sufferings
of
others
always
afforded
him
a
delight
increased
tenfold
by
the
horror
of
the
scene
and
a
feeling
of
exquisite
fear
silvere
on
recognising
that
vile
scamp
s
head
all
by
itself
above
the
wall
that
pale
grinning
face
with
hair
standing
on
end
experienced
a
feeling
of
fierce
rage
a
sudden
desire
to
live
it
was
the
last
revolt
of
his
blood
a
momentary
mutiny
he
again
sank
down
on
his
knees
gazing
straight
before
him
a
last
vision
passed
before
his
eyes
in
the
melancholy
twilight
at
the
end
of
the
path
at
the
entrance
of
the
impasse
he
fancied
he
could
see
aunt
dide
standing
erect
white
and
rigid
like
the
statue
of
a
saint
while
she
witnessed
his
agony
from
a
distance
at
that
moment
he
felt
the
cold
pistol
on
his
temple
there
was
a
smile
on
justin
s
pale
face
closing
his
eyes
silvere
heard
the
dead
wildly
summoning
him
in
the
darkness
he
now
saw
nothing
save
miette
wrapped
in
the
banner
under
the
trees
with
her
eyes
turned
towards
heaven
then
the
man
fired
and
all
was
over
the
lad
s
skull
burst
open
like
a
ripe
pomegranate
his
face
fell
upon
the
stone
with
his
lips
pressed
to
the
spot
which
miette
s
feet
had
worn
that
warm
spot
which
still
retained
a
trace
of
his
dead
love
and
in
the
evening
at
dessert
at
the
rougons
abode
bursts
of
laughter
arose
with
the
fumes
from
the
table
which
was
still
warm
with
the
remains
of
the
dinner
at
last
the
rougons
were
nibbling
at
the
pleasures
of
the
wealthy
their
appetites
sharpened
by
thirty
years
of
restrained
desire
now
fell
to
with
wolfish
teeth
these
fierce
insatiate
wild
beasts
scarcely
entering
upon
indulgence
exulted
at
the
birth
of
the
empire
the
dawn
of
the
rush
for
the
spoils
the
coup
d
etat
which
retrieved
the
fortune
of
the
bonapartes
also
laid
the
foundation
for
that
of
the
rougons
pierre
stood
up
held
out
his
glass
and
exclaimed
i
drink
to
prince
louis
to
the
emperor
the
gentlemen
who
had
drowned
their
jealousies
in
champagne
rose
in
a
body
and
clinked
glasses
with
deafening
shouts
it
was
a
fine
spectacle
the
bourgeois
of
plassans
roudier
granoux
vuillet
and
all
the
others
wept
and
embraced
each
other
over
the
corpse
of
the
republic
which
as
yet
was
scarcely
cold
but
a
splendid
idea
occurred
to
sicardot
he
took
from
felicite
s
hair
a
pink
satin
bow
which
she
had
placed
over
her
right
ear
in
honour
of
the
occasion
cut
off
a
strip
of
the
satin
with
his
dessert
knife
and
then
solemnly
fastened
it
to
rougon
s
the
latter
feigned
modesty
and
pretended
to
resist
but
his
face
beamed
with
joy
as
he
murmured
no
i
beg
you
it
is
too
soon
we
must
wait
until
the
decree
is
zounds
sicardot
exclaimed
will
you
please
keep
that
it
s
an
old
soldier
of
napoleon
who
decorates
you
the
whole
company
burst
into
applause
felicite
almost
swooned
with
delight
silent
granoux
jumped
up
on
a
chair
in
his
enthusiasm
waving
his
napkin
and
making
a
speech
which
was
lost
amid
the
uproar
the
yellow
was
wild
with
triumph
but
the
strip
of
pink
satin
fastened
to
pierre
s
was
not
the
only
red
spot
in
that
triumph
of
the
rougons
a
shoe
with
a
heel
still
lay
forgotten
under
the
bedstead
in
the
adjoining
room
the
taper
burning
at
monsieur
peirotte
s
bedside
over
the
way
gleamed
too
with
the
lurid
redness
of
a
gaping
wound
amidst
the
dark
night
and
yonder
far
away
in
the
depths
of
the
aire
a
pool
of
blood
was
congealing
upon
a
tombstone
