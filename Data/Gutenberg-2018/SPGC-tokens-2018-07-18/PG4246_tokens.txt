dedicate
this
book
as
a

tribute

beulah
chapter
i
a
january
sun
had
passed
the
zenith
and
the
slanting
rays
flamed
over
the
window
panes
of
a
large
brick
building
bearing
on
its
front
in
golden
letters
the
inscription
orphan
asylum
the
structure
was
commodious
and
surrounded
by
wide
galleries
while
the
situation
offered
a
silent
tribute
to
the
discretion
and
good
sense
of
the
board
of
managers
who
selected
the
suburbs
instead
of
the
more
densely
populated
portion
of
the
city
the
whitewashed
palings
inclosed
as
a
front
yard
or
lawn
rather
more
than
an
acre
of
ground
sown
in
grass
and
studded
with
trees
among
which
the
shelled
walks
meandered
gracefully
a
long
avenue
of
elms
and
poplars
extended
from
the
gate
to
the
principal
entrance
and
imparted
to
the
asylum
an
imposing
and
venerable
aspect
there
was
very
little
shrubbery
but
here
and
there
orange
boughs
bent
beneath
their
load
of
golden
fruitage
while
the
glossy
foliage
stirred
by
the
wind
trembled
and
glistened
in
the
sunshine
beyond
the
inclosure
stretched
the
common
dotted
with
occasional
clumps
of
pine
and
leafless
oaks
through
which
glimpses
of
the
city
might
be
had
building
and
grounds
wore
a
quiet
peaceful
inviting
look
singularly
appropriate
for
the
purpose
designated
by
the
inscription
orphan
asylum
a
haven
for
the
desolate
and
miserable
the
front
door
was
closed
but
upon
the
broad
granite
steps
where
the
sunlight
lay
warm
and
tempting
sat
a
trio
of
the
inmates
in
the
foreground
was
a
slight
fairy
form
a
wee
winsome
thing
with
coral
lips
and
large
soft
blue
eyes
set
in
a
frame
of
short
clustering
golden
curls
she
looked
about
six
years
old
and
was
clad
like
her
companions
in
flannel
dress
and
check
apron
lillian
was
the
pet
of
the
asylum
and
now
her
rosy
cheek
rested
upon
her
tiny
white
palm
as
though
she
wearied
of
the
which
lay
at
her
feet
the
figure
beside
her
was
one
whose
marvelous
beauty
riveted
the
gaze
of
all
who
chanced
to
see
her
the
child
could
have
been
but
a
few
months
older
than
lillian
yet
the
brilliant
black
eyes
the
peculiar
curve
of
the
dimpled
mouth
and
long
dark
ringlets
gave
to
the
oval
face
a
maturer
and
more
piquant
loveliness
the
cast
of
claudia
countenance
bespoke
her
foreign
parentage
and
told
of
the
warm
fierce
italian
blood
that
glowed
in
her
cheeks
there
was
fascinating
grace
in
every
movement
even
in
the
easy
indolence
of
her
position
as
she
bent
on
one
knee
to
curl
lillian
locks
over
her
finger
on
the
upper
step
in
the
rear
of
these
two
sat
a
girl
whose
age
could
not
have
been
very
accurately
guessed
from
her
countenance
and
whose
features
contrasted
strangely
with
those
of
her
companions
at
a
first
casual
glance
one
thought
her
rather
homely
nay
decidedly
ugly
yet
to
the
curious
physiognomist
this
face
presented
greater
attractions
than
either
of
the
others
reader
i
here
paint
you
the
portrait
of
that
quiet
little
figure
whose
history
is
contained
in
the
following
pages
a
pair
of
large
gray
eyes
set
beneath
an
overhanging
forehead
a
boldly
projecting
forehead
broad
and
smooth
a
rather
large
but
finely
cut
mouth
an
irreproachable
nose
of
the
order
furthest
removed
from
aquiline
and
heavy
black
eyebrows
which
instead
of
arching
stretched
straight
across
and
nearly
met
there
was
not
a
vestige
of
color
in
her
cheeks
face
neck
and
hands
wore
a
sickly
pallor
and
a
mass
of
rippling
jetty
hair
drawn
smoothly
over
the
temples
rendered
this
whiteness
more
apparent
unlike
the
younger
children
beulah
was
busily
sewing
upon
what
seemed
the
counterpart
of
their
aprons
and
the
sad
expression
of
the
countenance
the
lips
firmly
compressed
as
if
to
prevent
the
utterance
of
complaint
showed
that
she
had
become
acquainted
with
cares
and
sorrows
of
which
they
were
yet
happily
ignorant
her
eyes
were
bent
down
on
her
work
and
the
long
black
lashes
nearly
touched
her
cold
cheeks
sister
beulah
ought
claudy
to
say
that
cried
lillian
turning
round
and
laying
her
hand
upon
the
piece
of
sewing
say
what
lilly
i
was
not
listening
to
you
she
said
she
hoped
that
largest
robin
redbreast
would
get
drunk
and
tumble
down
he
would
be
sure
to
bump
some
of
his
pretty
bright
feathers
out
if
he
rolled
over
the
shells
two
or
three
times
answered
lilly
pointing
to
a
china
tree
near
where
a
flock
of
robins
were
eagerly
chirping
over
the
feast
of
berries
why
claudy
how
can
you
wish
the
poor
little
fellow
such
bad
luck
the
dark
thoughtful
eyes
full
of
deep
meaning
rested
on
claudia
radiant
face
oh
you
need
not
think
i
am
a
bear
or
a
hawk
ready
to
swallow
the
darling
little
beauty
alive
i
would
not
have
him
lose
a
feather
for
the
world
but
i
should
like
the
fun
of
seeing
him
stagger
and
wheel
over
and
over
and
tumble
off
the
limb
so
that
i
might
run
and
catch
him
in
my
apron
do
you
think
i
would
give
him
to
our
matron
to
make
a
pie
no
you
might
take
off
my
fingers
first
and
the
little
elf
snapped
them
emphatically
in
beulah
face
make
a
pie
of
robies
indeed
i
would
starve
before
i
would
eat
a
piece
of
it
chimed
in
lilly
with
childish
horror
at
the
thought
claudia
laughed
with
mingled
mischief
and
chagrin
you
say
you
would
not
eat
a
bit
of
to
save
your
life
well
you
did
it
last
week
anyhow
oh
claudy
i
did
oh
but
you
did
do
you
remember
susan
picked
up
a
bird
last
week
that
fell
out
of
this
very
tree
and
gave
it
to
our
matron
well
did
we
have
for
dinner
yes
but
one
poor
little
fellow
would
not
make
a
pie
they
had
some
birds
already
that
came
from
the
market
and
i
heard
williams
tell
susan
to
put
it
in
with
the
others
so
you
see
you
did
eat
and
i
did
for
i
knew
what
was
in
it
i
saw
its
head
wrung
off
well
i
hope
i
did
not
get
any
of
roby
i
wo
eat
any
more
pie
till
they
have
all
gone
was
lilly
consolatory
reflection
chancing
to
glance
toward
the
gate
she
exclaimed
there
is
a
carriage
what
is
let
me
see
wednesday
yes
this
is
the
evening
for
the
ladies
to
meet
here
lil
is
my
face
right
clean
because
that
miss
dorothy
always
takes
particular
pains
to
look
at
it
she
rubbed
her
over
it
the
other
day
i
do
hate
her
do
you
cried
claudia
springing
up
and
buttoning
the
band
of
her
apron
sleeve
which
had
become
unfastened
why
claudy
i
am
astonished
to
hear
you
talk
so
miss
dorothy
helps
to
buy
food
and
clothes
for
us
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
speak
of
her
as
you
do
as
she
delivered
this
reprimand
beulah
snatched
up
a
small
volume
and
hid
it
in
her
i
do
believe
she
gives
us
much
i
do
hate
her
and
i
ca
help
it
she
is
so
ugly
and
cross
and
i
should
not
like
her
to
look
at
my
mug
of
milk
you
do
love
her
either
any
more
than
i
do
only
you
wo
say
anything
about
her
but
kiss
me
and
i
promise
i
will
be
good
and
not
make
faces
at
her
in
my
apron
beulah
stooped
down
and
warmly
kissed
the
suppliant
then
took
her
little
sister
hand
and
led
her
into
the
house
just
as
the
carriage
reached
the
door
the
children
presented
a
pleasant
spectacle
as
they
entered
the
long
dining
room
and
ranged
themselves
for
inspection
heirs
of
orphanage
varying
in
years
from
one
crawling
infant
to
grown
girls
all
neatly
clad
and
with
smiling
contented
faces
if
we
except
one
grave
countenance
which
might
have
been
remarked
by
the
close
observer
the
weekly
visiting
committee
consisted
of
four
of
the
lady
managers
but
the
number
was
swelled
to
six
a
glance
at
the
inspectors
sufficed
to
inform
beulah
that
something
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
had
convened
them
on
the
present
occasion
and
she
was
passing
on
to
her
accustomed
place
when
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
familiar
face
partially
concealed
by
a
straw
bonnet
it
was
her
teacher
a
sudden
glad
light
flashed
over
the
countenance
and
the
pale
lips
disclosed
a
set
of
faultlessly
beautiful
teeth
as
she
smiled
and
hastened
to
her
friend
how
do
you
do
mason
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
thank
you
beulah
i
have
been
promising
myself
this
pleasure
a
great
while
i
saw
eugene
this
morning
and
told
him
i
was
coming
out
he
sent
you
a
book
and
a
message
here
is
the
book
you
are
to
mark
the
passages
you
like
particularly
and
study
them
well
until
he
comes
when
did
you
see
him
last
mason
put
the
volume
in
her
hand
as
she
spoke
it
has
been
more
than
a
week
since
he
was
here
and
i
was
afraid
he
was
sick
he
is
very
kind
and
good
to
remember
the
book
he
promised
me
and
i
thank
you
very
much
mason
for
bringing
it
the
face
was
radiant
with
newborn
joy
but
it
all
died
out
when
miss
dorothea
white
little
claudia
particular
aversion
fixed
her
pale
blue
eyes
upon
her
and
asked
in
a
sharp
discontented
tone
what
ails
that
girl
williams
she
does
not
work
enough
or
she
would
have
some
blood
in
her
cheeks
has
she
been
sick
no
madam
she
has
not
been
sick
exactly
but
somehow
she
never
looks
strong
and
hearty
like
the
others
she
works
well
enough
there
is
not
a
better
or
more
industrious
girl
in
the
asylum
but
i
rather
think
she
studies
too
much
she
will
sit
up
and
read
of
nights
when
the
others
are
all
sound
asleep
and
very
often
when
kate
and
i
put
out
the
hall
lamp
we
find
her
with
her
book
alone
in
the
cold
i
ca
get
my
consent
to
forbid
her
reading
especially
as
it
never
interferes
with
her
regular
work
and
she
is
so
fond
of
it
as
the
matron
uttered
these
words
she
glanced
at
the
child
and
sighed
involuntarily
you
are
too
indulgent
williams
we
can
not
afford
to
feed
and
clothe
girls
of
her
age
to
wear
themselves
out
reading
trash
all
night
we
are
very
much
in
arrears
at
best
and
i
think
some
plan
should
be
adopted
to
make
these
large
girls
who
have
been
on
hand
so
long
more
useful
what
do
you
say
ladies
miss
dorothea
looked
around
for
some
encouragement
and
support
in
her
move
well
for
my
part
miss
white
i
think
that
child
is
not
strong
enough
to
do
much
hard
work
she
always
has
looked
delicate
and
pale
said
taylor
an
woman
who
had
taken
one
of
the
youngest
orphans
on
her
knee
my
dear
friend
that
is
the
very
reason
she
does
not
exercise
sufficiently
to
make
her
robust
just
look
at
her
face
and
hands
as
bloodless
as
a
turnip
beulah
do
ask
her
to
give
you
some
of
her
beautiful
color
she
looks
exactly
like
a
cake
of
tallow
with
two
glass
beads
in
the
middle
hush
and
beulah
hand
was
pressed
firmly
over
claudia
crimson
lips
lest
the
whisper
of
the
indignant
little
brunette
should
reach
ears
for
which
it
was
not
intended
as
no
one
essayed
to
answer
miss
white
the
matron
ventured
to
suggest
a
darling
scheme
of
her
own
i
have
always
hoped
the
managers
would
conclude
to
educate
her
for
a
teacher
she
is
so
studious
i
know
she
would
learn
very
rapidly
my
dear
madam
you
do
not
in
the
least
understand
what
you
are
talking
about
it
would
require
at
least
five
years
careful
training
to
fit
her
to
teach
and
our
finances
do
not
admit
of
any
such
expenditure
as
the
best
thing
for
her
i
should
move
to
bind
her
out
to
a
or
milliner
but
she
could
not
stand
the
confinement
she
would
go
off
with
consumption
in
less
than
a
year
there
is
the
trouble
with
these
delicate
children
how
is
the
babe
that
was
brought
here
last
week
asked
taylor
oh
he
is
doing
beautifully
bring
him
round
the
table
susan
and
the
rosy
smiling
infant
was
handed
about
for
closer
inspection
a
few
general
inquiries
followed
and
then
beulah
was
not
surprised
to
hear
the
order
given
for
the
children
to
retire
as
the
managers
had
some
especial
business
with
their
matron
the
orphan
band
defiled
into
the
hall
and
dispersed
to
their
various
occupations
but
beulah
approached
the
matron
and
whispered
something
to
which
the
reply
was
no
if
you
have
finished
that
other
apron
you
shall
sew
no
more
you
can
pump
a
fresh
bucket
of
water
and
then
run
out
into
the
yard
for
some
air
she
performed
the
duty
assigned
to
her
and
then
hastened
to
the
dormitory
whither
lillian
and
claudia
had
preceded
her
the
latter
was
standing
on
a
chair
mimicking
miss
dorothea
and
haranguing
her
sole
auditor
in
a
nasal
twang
which
she
contrived
to
force
from
her
beautiful
curling
lips
at
sight
of
beulah
she
sprang
toward
her
exclaiming
you
shall
be
a
teacher
if
you
want
to
sha
you
beulah
i
am
afraid
not
claudy
but
do
say
any
more
about
her
she
is
not
as
kind
as
our
dear
matron
or
some
of
the
managers
but
she
thinks
she
is
right
remember
she
made
these
pretty
blue
curtains
round
your
and
lilly
bed
i
do
care
if
she
did
all
the
ladies
were
making
them
and
she
did
no
more
than
the
rest
never
mind
i
shall
be
a
young
lady
some
of
these
days
our
matron
says
i
will
be
beautiful
enough
to
marry
the
president
and
then
i
will
see
whether
miss
dorothy
comes
meddling
and
bothering
you
any
more
the
brilliant
eyes
dilated
with
pleasure
at
the
thought
of
the
protection
which
the
future
would
afford
her
protegee
beulah
smiled
and
asked
almost
gayly
claudy
how
much
will
you
pay
me
a
month
to
dress
you
and
keep
your
hair
in
order
when
you
get
into
the
white
house
at
washington
oh
you
dear
darling
you
shall
have
everything
you
want
and
do
nothing
but
read
the
impulsive
child
threw
her
arms
around
beulah
neck
and
kissed
her
repeatedly
while
the
latter
bent
down
over
her
basket
lilly
here
are
some
chinquapins
for
you
and
olaudy
i
am
going
out
into
the
yard
and
you
may
both
go
and
play
in
the
debating
room
of
the
visiting
committee
miss
white
again
had
the
floor
she
was
no
less
important
a
personage
than
vice
president
of
the
board
of
managers
and
felt
authorized
to
investigate
closely
and
redress
all
grievances
who
did
you
say
sent
that
book
here
mrs
mason
eugene
rutland
who
was
once
a
member
of
williams
orphan
charge
in
this
asylum
graham
adopted
him
and
he
is
now
known
as
eugene
graham
he
is
very
much
attached
to
beulah
though
i
believe
they
are
not
at
all
related
he
left
the
asylum
before
i
entered
the
board
what
sort
of
boy
is
he
i
have
seen
him
several
times
and
do
not
particularly
fancy
him
oh
madam
he
is
a
noble
boy
it
was
a
great
trial
to
me
to
part
with
him
three
years
ago
he
is
much
older
than
beulah
and
loves
her
as
well
as
if
she
were
his
sister
said
the
matron
more
hastily
than
was
her
custom
when
answering
any
of
the
managers
i
suppose
he
has
put
this
notion
of
being
a
teacher
into
her
head
well
she
must
get
it
out
that
is
all
i
know
of
an
excellent
situation
where
a
lady
is
willing
to
pay
six
dollars
a
month
for
a
girl
of
her
age
to
attend
to
an
infant
and
i
think
we
must
secure
it
for
her
oh
miss
white
she
is
not
able
to
carry
a
heavy
child
always
in
her
arms
expostulated
williams
yes
she
is
i
will
venture
to
say
she
looks
all
the
better
for
it
at
the
month
end
the
last
sentence
fraught
with
interest
to
herself
fell
upon
beulah
ear
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
and
an
unerring
intuition
told
her
you
are
the
one
she
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
to
shut
out
miss
dorothea
sharp
tones
and
hurried
away
with
a
dim
foreboding
of
coming
evil
which
pressed
heavily
upon
her
young
heart
chapter
ii
the
following
day
in
obedience
to
the
proclamation
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
was
celebrated
as
a
season
of
special
thanksgiving
and
the
inmates
of
the
asylum
were
taken
to
church
to
morning
service
after
an
early
dinner
the
matron
gave
them
permission
to
amuse
themselves
the
remainder
of
the
day
as
their
various
inclinations
prompted
there
was
an
immediate
dispersion
of
the
assemblage
and
only
beulah
lingered
beside
the
matron
chair
williams
may
i
take
lilly
with
me
and
go
out
into
the
woods
at
the
back
of
the
asylum
i
want
you
at
home
this
evening
but
i
dislike
very
much
to
refuse
you
oh
never
mind
if
you
wish
me
to
do
anything
answered
the
girl
cheerfully
tears
rolled
over
the
matron
face
and
hastily
averting
her
head
she
wiped
them
away
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
can
i
do
anything
to
help
you
what
is
the
matter
never
mind
beulah
do
you
get
your
bonnet
and
go
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
not
too
far
remember
and
if
i
must
have
you
why
i
will
send
for
you
i
would
rather
not
go
if
it
will
be
any
trouble
no
dear
it
no
trouble
i
want
you
to
go
answered
the
matron
turning
hastily
away
beulah
felt
very
strongly
inclined
to
follow
and
inquire
what
was
in
store
for
her
but
the
weight
on
her
heart
pressed
more
heavily
and
murmuring
to
herself
it
will
come
time
enough
time
enough
she
passed
on
may
i
come
with
you
and
lilly
entreated
little
claudia
running
down
the
walk
at
full
speed
and
putting
her
curly
head
through
the
palings
to
make
the
request
yes
come
on
you
and
lily
can
pick
up
some
nice
smooth
burrs
to
make
baskets
of
but
where
is
your
bonnet
i
forgot
it
she
ran
up
almost
out
of
breath
and
seized
beulah
hand
you
forgot
it
indeed
you
little
witch
you
will
burn
as
black
as
a
gypsy
i
do
care
if
i
do
i
hate
bonnets
take
care
claudy
the
president
wo
have
you
all
freckled
and
tanned
wo
he
queried
the
child
with
a
saucy
sparkle
in
her
black
eyes
that
he
wo
here
tie
on
my
hood
and
the
next
time
you
come
running
after
me
bareheaded
i
will
make
you
go
back
do
you
hear
yes
i
hear
i
wonder
why
miss
dorothy
do
bleach
off
her
freckles
she
looks
like
a
hush
about
her
and
run
on
ahead
do
pray
let
me
get
my
breath
first
which
way
are
we
going
to
the
piney
woods
yonder
cried
lilly
clapping
her
hands
in
childish
glee
wo
we
have
fun
rolling
and
sliding
on
the
straw
the
two
little
ones
walked
on
in
advance
the
path
along
which
their
feet
pattered
so
carelessly
led
to
a
hollow
or
ravine
and
the
ground
on
the
opposite
side
rose
into
small
hillocks
thickly
wooded
with
pines
beulah
sat
down
upon
a
mound
of
moss
and
leaves
while
claudia
and
lillian
throwing
off
their
hoods
commenced
the
glorious
game
of
sliding
the
pine
straw
presented
an
almost
glassy
surface
and
starting
from
the
top
of
a
hillock
they
slid
down
often
stumbling
and
rolling
together
to
the
bottom
many
a
peal
of
laughter
rang
out
and
echoed
far
back
in
the
forest
and
two
blackbirds
could
not
have
kept
up
a
more
continuous
chatter
apart
from
all
this
sat
beulah
she
had
remembered
the
matron
words
and
stopped
just
at
the
verge
of
the
woods
whence
she
could
see
the
white
palings
of
the
asylum
above
her
the
winter
breeze
moaned
and
roared
in
the
pine
tops
it
was
the
sad
but
dearly
loved
forest
music
that
she
so
often
stole
out
to
listen
to
every
breath
which
sighed
through
the
emerald
boughs
seemed
to
sweep
a
sympathetic
chord
in
her
soul
and
she
raised
her
arms
toward
the
trees
as
though
she
longed
to
clasp
the
mighty
musical
box
of
nature
to
her
heart
the
blue
of
a
cloudless
sky
looked
in
upon
her
like
a
watchful
guardian
the
sunlight
fell
slantingly
now
mellowing
the
brown
leaves
and
knotted
trunks
and
now
seeming
to
shun
the
darker
spots
and
recesses
where
shadows
lurked
for
a
time
the
girl
forgot
all
but
the
quiet
and
majestic
beauty
of
the
scene
she
loved
nature
as
only
those
can
whose
sources
of
pleasure
have
been
sadly
curtailed
and
her
heart
went
out
so
to
speak
after
birds
and
trees
and
flowers
sunshine
and
stars
and
the
voices
of
sweeping
winds
an
open
volume
lay
on
her
lap
it
was
poems
the
book
eugene
had
sent
her
and
leaves
were
turned
down
at
excelsior
and
the
psalm
of
life
the
changing
countenance
indexed
very
accurately
the
emotions
which
were
excited
by
this
communion
with
nature
there
was
an
uplifted
look
a
brave
glad
hopeful
light
in
the
gray
eyes
generally
so
troubled
in
their
expression
a
sacred
song
rose
on
the
evening
air
a
solemn
but
beautiful
hymn
she
sang
the
words
of
the
great
poet
the
psalm
of
life
tell
me
not
in
mournful
numbers
life
is
but
an
empty
dream
for
the
soul
is
dead
that
slumbers
and
things
are
not
what
they
seem
it
was
wonderful
what
power
and
sweetness
there
was
in
her
voice
burst
after
burst
of
rich
melody
fell
from
her
trembling
lips
her
soul
echoed
the
sentiments
of
the
immortal
bard
and
she
repeated
again
and
again
the
fifth
verse
in
the
world
broad
field
of
battle
in
the
bivouac
of
life
be
not
like
dumb
driven
cattle
be
a
hero
in
the
strife
intuitively
she
seemed
to
feel
that
an
hour
of
great
trial
was
at
hand
and
this
was
a
girding
for
the
combat
with
the
shield
of
a
warm
hopeful
heart
and
the
sword
of
a
strong
unfaltering
will
she
awaited
the
shock
but
as
she
concluded
her
song
the
head
bowed
itself
upon
her
arms
the
shadow
of
the
unknown
lowering
future
had
fallen
upon
her
face
and
only
the
great
shepherd
knew
what
passed
the
pale
lips
of
the
young
orphan
she
was
startled
by
the
sharp
bark
of
a
dog
and
looking
up
saw
a
gentleman
leaning
against
a
neighboring
tree
and
regarding
her
very
earnestly
he
came
forward
as
she
perceived
him
and
said
with
a
pleasant
smile
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
dog
like
his
master
he
would
not
disturb
you
till
you
finished
your
song
down
carlo
be
quiet
sir
my
little
friend
tell
me
who
taught
you
to
sing
she
had
hastily
risen
and
a
slight
glow
tinged
her
cheek
at
his
question
though
naturally
reserved
and
timid
there
was
a
possession
about
her
unusual
in
children
of
her
age
and
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
i
have
never
had
a
teacher
sir
but
i
listen
to
the
choir
on
sabbath
and
sing
our
hymns
at
church
do
you
know
who
wrote
those
words
you
sang
just
now
i
was
not
aware
they
had
been
set
to
music
i
found
them
in
this
book
yesterday
and
liked
them
so
much
that
i
tried
to
sing
them
by
one
of
our
hymn
tunes
she
held
up
the
volume
as
she
spoke
he
glanced
at
the
title
and
then
looked
curiously
at
her
beulah
chanced
just
then
to
turn
toward
the
asylum
and
saw
one
of
the
oldest
girls
running
across
the
common
the
shadow
on
her
face
deepened
and
she
looked
around
for
claudia
and
lillian
they
had
tired
of
sliding
and
were
busily
engaged
picking
up
pine
burrs
at
some
little
distance
in
the
rear
come
claudy
lilly
our
matron
has
sent
for
us
come
make
haste
do
you
belong
to
the
asylum
asked
the
gentleman
shaking
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
yes
sir
answered
she
and
as
the
children
came
up
she
bowed
and
turned
homeward
wait
a
moment
those
are
not
your
sisters
certainly
his
eyes
rested
with
unfeigned
admiration
on
their
beautiful
faces
this
one
is
sir
that
is
not
as
she
spoke
she
laid
her
hand
on
lillian
head
claudia
looked
shyly
at
the
stranger
and
then
seizing
beulah
dress
exclaimed
oh
beulah
do
let
us
go
just
yet
i
left
such
a
nice
splendid
pile
of
burrs
yes
we
must
go
yonder

katy
for
us
sir
my
little
friend
some
of
these
days
i
shall
come
to
the
asylum
to
see
you
all
and
have
you
sing
that
song
again
she
made
no
reply
but
catching
her
sister
hand
walked
rapidly
homeward
katy
delivered
williams
message
and
assured
beulah
she
must
make
haste
for
miss
dorothy
was
displeased
that
the
children
were
absent
what
is
she
there
again
the
hateful
beulah
hand
was
over
claudia
mouth
and
prevented
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
that
short
walk
was
painful
and
conflicting
hopes
and
fears
chased
each
other
in
the
sister
heart
as
she
tightened
her
hold
on
lilly
hand
oh
what
a
beautiful
carriage
cried
claudia
as
they
approached
the
door
and
descried
an
elegant
carriage
glittering
with
silver
mountings
and
drawn
by
a
pair
of
spirited
black
horses
yes
that
it
is
and
there
is
a
lady
and
gentleman
here
who
must
be
very
rich
judging
from
their
looks
they
brought
miss
white
what
do
they
want
katy
asked
claudia
i
do
know
for
certain
though
i
have
my
own
thoughts
answered
the
girl
with
a
knowing
laugh
that
grated
on
beulah
ears
here
beulah
bring
them
to
the
dormitory
said
williams
meeting
them
at
the
door
and
hurrying
them
upstairs
she
hastily
washed
claudia
face
and
recurled
her
hair
while
the
same
offices
were
performed
for
lillian
by
her
sister
do
rub
my
hand
so
hard
you
hurt
cried
out
claudia
sharply
as
in
perfect
silence
and
with
an
anxious
countenance
the
kind
matron
dressed
her
i
only
want
to
get
it
white
and
clean
beauty
was
the
conciliatory
reply
well
i
tell
you
that
wo
come
off
because
it
turpentine
retorted
the
little
elf
come
beulah
bring
lilly
along
miss
white
is
out
of
patience
what
does
all
this
mean
said
beulah
taking
her
sister
hand
do
ask
me
poor
child
as
she
spoke
the
good
woman
ushered
the
trio
into
the
reception
room
none
of
the
other
children
were
present
beulah
noted
this
circumstance
and
drawing
a
long
breath
looked
around
miss
white
was
eagerly
talking
to
a
richly
dressed
and
very
pretty
woman
while
a
gentleman
stood
beside
them
impatiently
twirling
his
seal
and
all
looked
up
and
miss
white
exclaimed
here
they
are
now
my
dear
grayson
i
rather
think
you
can
be
suited
come
here
little
ones
she
drew
claudia
to
her
side
while
lilly
clung
closer
to
her
sister
oh
what
beauties
only
look
at
them
alfred
grayson
glanced
eagerly
from
one
to
the
other
very
pretty
children
indeed
my
dear
extremely
pretty
particularly
the
one
answered
her
husband
with
far
less
ecstasy
i
do
know
i
believe
i
admire
the
one
most
she
is
a
perfect
fairy
come
here
my
love
and
let
me
talk
to
you
continued
she
addressing
lilly
the
child
clasped
her
fingers
more
firmly
and
did
not
advance
an
inch
do
not
hold
her
beulah
come
to
the
lady
lillian
said
miss
white
as
beulah
gently
disengaged
her
hand
she
felt
as
if
the
anchor
of
hope
had
been
torn
from
her
hold
but
stooping
down
she
whispered
go
to
the
lady
lilly
darling
i
will
not
leave
you
thus
encouraged
the
little
figure
moved
slowly
forward
and
paused
in
front
of
the
stranger
grayson
took
her
small
white
hands
tenderly
and
pressing
a
warm
kiss
on
her
lips
said
in
a
kind
winning
tone
what
is
your
name
my
dear
lillian
but
sister
calls
me
lilly
who
is
little
claudia
here
oh
no
sister
beulah
and
the
soft
blue
eyes
turned
lovingly
toward
that
gentle
sister
good
heavens
alfred
how
totally
unlike
this
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
children
i
have
ever
seen
and
that
girl
yonder
is
ugly
said
the
lady
in
an
undertone
to
her
husband
who
was
talking
to
claudia
it
was
said
in
a
low
voice
but
beulah
heard
every
syllable
and
a
glow
of
shame
for
an
instant
bathed
her
brow
claudia
heard
it
too
and
springing
from
grayson
knee
she
exclaimed
angrily
she
is
ugly
any
such
thing
she
is
the
smartest
girl
in
the
asylum
and
i
love
her
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
no
beulah
is
not
pretty
but
she
is
good
and
that
is
far
better
said
the
matron
laying
her
trembling
hand
on
beulah
shoulder
a
bitter
smile
curled
the
girl
lips
but
she
did
not
move
her
eyes
from
lillian
face
fanny
if
you
select
that
little
one
you
will
have
some
temper
to
curb
suggested
grayson
somewhat
amused
by
claudia
burst
of
indignation
oh
my
dear
husband
i
must
have
them
both
only
fancy
how
lovely
they
will
be
dressed
exactly
alike
my
little
lilly
and
you
claudia
will
you
come
and
be
my
daughters
i
shall
love
you
very
much
and
that
gentleman
will
be
your
papa
he
is
very
kind
you
shall
have
big
wax
dolls
as
high
as
your
heads
and
and
and
beautiful
blue
and
pink
silk
dresses
and
every
evening
i
shall
take
you
out
to
ride
in
my
carriage
each
of
you
shall
have
a
white
hat
with
long
curling
feathers
will
you
come
and
live
with
me
and
let
me
be
your
mamma
beulah
face
assumed
an
ashen
hue
as
she
listened
to
these
coaxing
words
she
had
not
thought
of
separation
the
evil
had
never
presented
itself
in
this
form
and
staggering
forward
she
clutched
the
matron
dress
saying
hoarsely
oh
do
separate
us
do
let
them
take
lilly
from
me
i
will
do
anything
on
earth
i
will
work
my
hands
off
oh
do
anything
but
please
oh
please
do
give
lilly
up
my
own
darling
lilly
claudia
here
interrupted
i
should
like
to
go
well
enough
if
you
will
take
beulah
too
lil
are
you
going
no
no
lillian
broke
away
from
the
stranger
clasping
arm
and
rushed
toward
her
sister
but
miss
white
sat
between
them
and
catching
the
child
she
firmly
though
very
gently
held
her
back
lilly
was
very
much
afraid
of
her
and
bursting
into
tears
she
cried
imploringly
oh
sister
take
me
take
me
beulah
sprang
to
her
side
and
said
almost
fiercely
give
her
to
me
she
is
mine
and
you
have
no
right
to
part
us
she
extended
her
arms
toward
the
little
form
struggling
to
reach
her
the
managers
have
decided
that
it
is
for
the
child
good
that
grayson
should
adopt
her
we
dislike
very
much
to
separate
sisters
but
it
can
not
be
avoided
whole
families
ca
be
adopted
by
one
person
and
you
must
not
interfere
she
will
soon
be
perfectly
satisfied
away
from
you
and
instead
of
encouraging
her
to
be
rebellious
you
ought
to
coax
her
to
behave
and
go
peaceably
replied
miss
white
still
keeping
beulah
at
arm
length
you
let
go
lilly
you
hateful
ugly
old
thing
you
she
sha
go
if
she
do
want
to
she
does
belong
to
beulah
cried
claudia
striding
up
and
laying
her
hand
on
lilly
arm
you
spoiled
insolent
little
wretch
muttered
miss
white
crimsoning
to
the
roots
of
her
fiery
hair
i
am
afraid
they
will
not
consent
to
go
fanny
suppose
you
take
claudia
the
other
seems
too
reluctant
said
grayson
looking
at
his
watch
but
i
do
so
want
that
little
angel
can
not
the
matron
influence
her
she
turned
to
her
as
she
spoke
thus
appealed
to
williams
took
the
child
in
her
arms
and
caressed
her
tenderly
my
dear
little
lilly
you
must
not
cry
and
struggle
so
why
will
you
not
go
with
this
kind
lady
she
will
love
you
very
much
oh
i
do
want
to
sobbed
she
pressing
her
wet
cheeks
against
the
matron
shoulder
but
lilly
love
you
shall
have
everything
you
want
kiss
me
like
a
sweet
girl
and
say
you
will
go
to
my
beautiful
home
i
will
give
you
a
cage
full
of
the
prettiest
canary
birds
you
ever
looked
at
do
you
love
to
ride
my
carriage
is
waiting
at
the
door
you
and
claudia
will
have
such
a
nice
time
grayson
knelt
beside
her
and
kissed
her
tenderly
still
she
clung
closer
to
the
matron
beulah
had
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
stood
trembling
like
a
weed
bowed
before
the
rushing
gale
she
knew
that
neither
expostulation
nor
entreaty
would
avail
now
and
she
resolved
to
bear
with
fortitude
what
she
could
not
avert
lifting
her
head
she
said
slowly
if
i
must
give
up
my
sister
let
me
do
so
as
quietly
as
possible
give
her
to
me
then
perhaps
she
will
go
more
willingly
do
not
force
her
away
oh
do
not
force
her
as
she
uttered
these
words
her
lips
were
white
and
cold
and
the
agonized
expression
of
her
face
made
grayson
shiver
lilly
my
darling
my
own
precious
darling
she
bent
over
her
sister
and
the
little
arms
clasped
her
neck
tightly
as
she
lifted
and
bore
her
back
to
the
dormitory
you
may
get
their
clothes
ready
williams
rest
assured
my
dear
grayson
they
will
go
now
without
any
further
difficulty
of
course
we
dislike
to
separate
sisters
but
it
ca
be
helped
sometimes
if
you
like
i
will
show
you
over
the
asylum
while
the
children
are
prepared
miss
white
led
the
way
to
the
schoolroom
i
am
very
dubious
about
that
little
one
fanny
how
will
you
ever
manage
two
such
dispositions
one
all
tears
and
the
other
all
fire
and
tow
said
grayson
a
truce
to
your
fears
alfred
we
shall
get
on
charmingly
after
the
first
few
days
how
proud
i
shall
be
with
such
jewels
beulah
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
drew
her
idol
close
to
her
heart
she
kissed
the
beautiful
face
and
smoothed
the
golden
curls
she
had
so
long
and
so
lovingly
arranged
and
as
the
child
returned
her
kisses
she
felt
as
if
rude
hands
were
tearing
her
loose
but
she
knew
she
must
give
her
up
there
was
no
effort
within
her
power
which
could
avail
to
keep
her
treasure
and
that
brave
spirit
nerved
itself
not
a
tear
dimmed
her
eye
not
a
sob
broke
from
her
colorless
lips
lilly
my
own
little
sister
you
must
not
cry
any
more
let
me
wash
your
face
you
will
make
your
head
ache
if
you
cry
so
oh
beulah
i
do
want
to
go
away
from
you
my
darling
i
know
you
do
but
you
will
have
a
great
many
things
to
make
you
happy
and
i
shall
come
to
see
you
as
often
as
i
can
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
go
either
but
i
can
not
help
it
and
i
want
you
to
go
quietly
and
be
so
good
that
the
lady
will
love
you
but
when
i
go
to
bed
you
will
not
be
there
to
hear
me
say
my
prayers
oh
sister
why
ca
you
go
they
do
not
want
me
my
dear
lilly
but
you
can
kneel
down
and
say
your
prayers
and
god
will
hear
you
just
as
well
as
if
you
were
here
with
me
and
i
will
ask
him
to
love
you
all
the
more
and
take
care
of
you
here
a
little
arm
stole
round
poor
beulah
neck
and
claudia
whispered
with
a
sob
will
you
ask
him
to
love
me
too
yes
claudy
i
will
we
will
try
to
be
good
oh
beulah
i
love
you
so
much
so
very
much
the
affectionate
child
pressed
her
lips
repeatedly
to
beulah
bloodless
cheek
claudy
if
you
love
me
you
must
be
kind
to
my
little
lilly
when
you
see
that
she
is
sad
and
crying
for
me
you
must
coax
her
to
be
as
contented
as
possible
and
always
speak
gently
to
her
will
you
do
this
for
beulah
yes
that
i
will
i
promise
you
i
will
and
what
is
more
i
will
fight
for
her
i
boxed
that
spiteful
charley
ears
the
other
day
for
vexing
her
and
i
will
scratch
anybody
eyes
out
that
dares
to
scold
her
this
very
morning
i
pinched
maggie
black
and
blue
for
bothering
her
and
i
tell
you
i
shall
not
let
anybody
impose
on
her
the
tears
dried
in
her
brilliant
eyes
and
she
clinched
her
little
fist
with
an
exalted
opinion
of
her
protective
powers
claudy
i
do
not
ask
you
to
fight
for
her
i
want
you
to
love
her
oh
love
her
always
be
kind
to
her
murmured
beulah
i
do
love
her
better
than
anything
in
the
world
do
i
lilly
dear
she
softly
kissed
one
of
the
child
hands
at
this
moment
the
matron
entered
with
a
large
bundle
neatly
wrapped
her
eyes
were
red
and
there
were
traces
of
tears
on
her
cheek
looking
tenderly
down
upon
the
trio
she
said
very
gently
come
my
pets
they
will
not
wait
any
longer
for
you
i
hope
you
will
try
to
be
good
and
love
each
other
and
beulah
shall
come
to
see
you
she
took
claudia
hand
and
led
her
down
the
steps
beulah
lifted
her
sister
and
carried
her
in
her
arms
as
she
had
done
from
her
birth
and
at
every
step
kissed
her
lips
and
brow
and
grayson
were
standing
at
the
front
door
they
both
looked
pleased
as
lilly
had
ceased
crying
and
the
carriage
door
was
opened
to
admit
them
ah
my
dears
now
for
a
nice
ride
claudia
jump
in
said
grayson
extending
his
hand
to
assist
her
she
paused
kissed
her
kind
matron
and
then
approached
beulah
she
could
not
bear
to
leave
her
and
as
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
sobbed
out
dear
good
beulah
i
will
take
care
of
lilly
please
love
me
and
ask
god
for
me
too
she
was
lifted
into
the
carriage
with
tears
streaming
over
her
face
beulah
drew
near
to
grayson
and
said
in
a
low
but
imploring
tone
oh
madam
love
my
sister
and
always
speak
affectionately
to
her
then
she
will
be
good
and
obedient
i
may
come
to
see
her
often
may
i
not
certainly
replied
the
lady
in
a
tone
which
chilled
poor
heart
she
swallowed
a
groan
of
agony
and
straining
the
loved
one
to
her
bosom
pressed
her
lips
to
lilly
god
bless
my
little
sister
my
darling
my
all
she
put
the
child
in
grayson
extended
arms
and
only
saw
that
her
sister
looked
back
appealingly
to
her
miss
white
came
up
and
said
something
which
she
did
not
hear
and
turning
hastily
away
she
went
up
to
the
dormitory
and
seated
herself
on
lilly
vacant
bed
the
child
knew
not
how
the
hours
passed
she
sat
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
until
the
light
of
a
candle
flashed
into
the
darkened
chamber
and
the
kind
voice
of
the
matron
fell
on
her
ear
beulah
will
you
try
to
eat
some
supper
do
dear
no
thank
you
i
do
want
anything
poor
child
i
would
have
saved
you
all
this
had
it
been
in
my
power
but
when
once
decided
by
the
managers
you
know
i
could
not
interfere
they
disliked
to
separate
you
and
lily
but
thought
that
under
the
circumstances
it
was
the
best
arrangement
they
could
make
beulah
i
want
to
tell
you
something
if
you
will
listen
to
me
she
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
took
one
of
the
girl
hands
between
both
hers
the
managers
think
it
is
best
that
you
should
go
out
and
take
a
situation
i
am
sorry
i
am
forced
to
give
you
up
very
sorry
for
you
have
always
been
a
good
girl
and
i
love
you
dearly
but
these
things
can
not
be
avoided
and
i
hope
all
will
turn
out
for
the
best
there
is
a
place
engaged
for
you
and
miss
white
wishes
you
to
go
i
trust
you
will
not
have
a
hard
time
you
are
to
take
care
of
an
infant
and
they
will
give
you
six
dollars
a
month
besides
your
board
and
clothes
try
to
do
your
duty
child
and
perhaps
something
may
happen
which
will
enable
you
to
turn
teacher
well
i
will
do
the
best
i
can
i
do
not
mind
work
but
then
her
head
went
down
on
her
arms
once
more
yes
dear
i
know
it
is
very
hard
for
you
to
part
with
her
but
remember
it
is
for
her
good
grayson
is
very
wealthy
and
of
course
lilly
and
claudy
will
have
and
what
is
money
to
my
again
she
paused
abruptly
ah
child
you
do
not
begin
to
know
money
is
everything
in
this
world
to
some
people
and
more
than
the
next
to
other
poor
souls
well
well
i
hope
it
will
prove
for
the
best
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
it
is
early
yet
but
maybe
you
had
better
go
to
bed
as
you
are
obliged
to
leave
in
the
morning
i
could
not
sleep
god
will
help
you
dear
child
if
you
try
to
do
your
duty
all
of
us
have
sorrows
and
if
yours
have
begun
early
they
may
not
last
long
poor
little
thing
i
shall
always
remember
you
in
my
prayers
she
kissed
her
gently
and
left
her
hoping
that
solitude
would
soothe
her
spirits
miss
white
words
rang
in
the
girl
ears
like
a
knell
she
will
soon
be
perfectly
satisfied
away
from
you
would
she
could
that
idolized
sister
learn
to
do
without
her
and
love
her
new
friends
as
fondly
as
the
untiring
one
who
had
cradled
her
in
her
arms
for
six
long
years
a
foreboding
dread
hissed
continually
do
you
suppose
the
wealthy
and
fashionable
grayson
who
lives
in
that
elegant
house
on
street
will
suffer
her
adopted
daughter
to
associate
intimately
with
a
hired
nurse
again
the
light
streamed
into
the
room
she
buried
her
face
deeper
in
her
apron
beulah
said
a
troubled
anxious
voice
oh
eugene
she
sprang
up
with
a
dry
sob
and
threw
herself
into
his
arms
i
know
it
all
dear
beulah
but
come
down
to
williams
room
there
is
a
bright
fire
there
and
your
hands
are
as
cold
as
ice
you
will
make
yourself
sick
sitting
here
without
even
a
shawl
around
you
he
led
her
downstairs
to
the
room
occupied
by
the
matron
who
kindly
took
her
work
to
the
dining
room
and
left
them
to
talk
unrestrainedly
sit
down
in
this
and
warm
your
hands
he
seated
himself
near
her
and
as
the
firelight
glowed
on
the
faces
of
both
they
contrasted
strangely
one
was
classical
and
full
of
youthful
beauty
the
other
wan
haggard
and
he
looked
about
sixteen
and
promised
to
become
a
strikingly
handsome
man
while
the
proportions
of
his
polished
brow
indicated
more
than
ordinary
intellectual
endowments
he
watched
his
companion
earnestly
sadly
and
leaning
forward
took
one
of
her
hands
beulah
i
see
from
your
face
that
you
have
not
shed
a
single
tear
i
wish
you
would
not
keep
your
sorrow
so
pent
up
in
your
heart
it
grieves
me
to
see
you
look
as
you
do
now
oh
i
ca
help
it
if
it
were
not
for
you
i
believe
i
should
die
i
am
so
very
miserable
eugene
if
you
could
have
seen
our
lilly
cling
to
me
even
to
the
last
moment
it
seems
to
me
my
heart
will
break
she
sank
her
weary
head
on
his
shoulder
yes
darling
i
know
you
are
suffering
very
much
but
remember
that
things
work
together
for
good
to
them
that
love
god
perhaps
he
sees
it
is
best
that
you
should
give
her
up
for
a
while
and
if
so
will
you
not
try
to
bear
it
cheerfully
instead
of
making
yourself
sick
with
useless
grief
he
gently
smoothed
the
hair
from
her
brow
as
he
spoke
she
did
not
reply
he
did
not
expect
that
she
would
and
continued
in
the
same
kind
tone
i
am
much
more
troubled
about
your
taking
this
situation
if
i
had
known
it
earlier
i
would
have
endeavored
to
prevent
it
but
i
suppose
it
can
not
be
helped
now
for
a
while
at
least
as
soon
as
possible
i
am
determined
you
shall
go
to
school
and
remember
dear
beulah
i
am
just
as
much
grieved
at
your
sorrows
as
you
are
in
a
few
years
i
shall
have
a
home
of
my
own
and
you
shall
be
the
first
to
come
to
it
never
mind
these
dark
stormy
days
do
you
remember
what
our
minister
said
in
his
sermon
last
sunday
darkest
hour
is
just
before
daybreak
already
i
begin
to
see
the
lining
of
clouds
that
a
few
years
or
even
months
ago
seemed
heavy
and
cheerless
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
ills
and
trials
of
this
world
but
i
think
a
brave
hopeful
spirit
will
do
much
toward
remedying
the
evil
for
my
part
i
look
forward
to
the
time
when
you
and
i
shall
have
a
home
of
our
own
and
then
lilly
and
claudy
can
be
with
us
i
was
talking
to
mason
about
it
yesterday
she
loves
you
very
much
i
dare
say
all
will
be
right
so
cheer
up
beulah
and
do
look
on
the
bright
side
eugene
you
are
the
only
bright
side
i
have
to
look
on
sometimes
i
think
you
will
get
tired
of
me
and
if
you
ever
do
i
shall
want
to
die
oh
how
could
i
bear
to
know
you
did
not
love
me
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
earnestly
at
his
noble
face
eugene
laughingly
repeated
her
words
get
tired
of
you
indeed
not
i
little
sister
oh
i
forgot
to
thank
you
for
your
book
i
like
it
better
than
anything
i
ever
read
some
parts
are
so
beautiful
so
very
grand
i
keep
it
in
my
basket
and
read
every
moment
i
can
spare
i
knew
you
would
like
it
particularly
beulah
i
have
written
on
my
banner
and
i
intend
like
that
noble
youth
to
press
forward
over
every
obstacle
mounting
at
every
step
until
i
too
stand
on
the
highest
pinnacle
and
plant
my
banner
where
its
glorious
motto
shall
float
over
the
world
that
poem
stirs
my
very
soul
like
martial
music
and
i
feel
as
if
i
should
like
to
see
longfellow
to
tell
him
how
i
thank
him
for
having
written
it
i
want
you
to
mark
the
passages
you
like
best
and
now
i
think
of
it
here
is
a
pencil
i
cut
for
you
he
drew
it
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
into
her
hand
while
his
face
glowed
with
enthusiasm
thank
you
thank
you
grateful
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
tears
which
acute
suffering
could
not
wring
from
her
he
saw
the
gathering
drops
and
said
gayly
if
that
is
the
way
you
intend
to
thank
me
i
shall
bring
you
no
more
pencils
but
you
look
very
pale
and
ought
to
be
asleep
for
i
have
no
doubt
will
be
a
trying
day
for
you
do
exert
yourself
to
be
brave
and
bear
it
all
for
a
little
while
i
know
it
will
not
be
very
long
and
i
shall
come
and
see

rose
as
he
spoke

obliged
to
go
so
soon
ca
you
stay
with
me
a
little
longer
pleaded
beulah
the
boy
eyes
filled
as
he
looked
at
the
beseeching
haggard
face
and
he
answered
hastily
not

must
go
to
sleep

need
it
sadly

will
be
cold

home
let
me
get
you

shawl

i
left
my
overcoat
in
the
hall
here
it
is
she
followed
him
out
to
the
door
as
he
drew
it
on
and
put
on
his
cap
the
moonlight
shone
over
the
threshold
and
he
thought
she
looked
ghostly
as
it
fell
upon
her
face
he
took
her
hand
pressed
it
gently
and
said
dear
beulah
eugene

me
again

to
complain

fast
and
keep
warm
she
pressed
his
hand
affectionately
watched
his
receding
form
as
long
as
she
could
trace
its
outline
and
then
went
slowly
back
to
the
dormitory
falling
on
her
knees
by
the
side
of
lilly
empty
couch
she
besought
god
in
trembling
accents
to
bless
her
darling
little
sister
and
claudy
and
to
give
her
strength
to
perform
all
her
duties
contentedly
and
cheerfully
chapter
iii
beulah
stood
waiting
on
the
steps
of
the
large
mansion
to
which
she
had
been
directed
by
miss
dorothea
white
her
heart
throbbed
painfully
and
her
hand
trembled
as
she
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
a
negro
waiter
who
merely
glanced
at
her
and
asked
carelessly
well
little
miss
what
do
you
want
is
martin
at
home
yes
miss
come
walk
in
there
is
but
a
poor
fire
in
the
front
parlor
suppose
you
sit
down
in
the
back
room
martin
will
be
down
in
a
minute
the
first
object
which
arrested
beulah
attention
was
a
center
table
covered
with
books
perhaps
thought
she
they
will
permit
me
to
read
some
of
them
while
she
sat
looking
over
the
titles
the
rustle
of
silk
caused
her
to
glance
around
and
she
saw
martin
quite
near
her
said
the
lady
with
a
searching
look
which
made
the
little
figure
tremble
madam
you
are
the
girl
miss
white
promised
to
send
from
the
asylum
are
you
not
yes
madam
do
you
think
you
can
take
good
care
of
my
baby

and
healthy
have
you
been
sick

well

may
want
you

sew
some
occasionally
when

well
madam
our
matron
says

name
miss
white
told
me
but
i
have
forgotten
it
beulah
benton
well
beulah
i
think
you
will
suit
me
very
well
if
you
are
only
careful
and
attend
to
my
directions
i
am
just
going
out
shopping
but
you
can
come
upstairs
and
take
charge
of
johnny
where
are
your
clothes
our
matron
will
send
them
beulah
followed
martin
up
the
steps
somewhat
reassured
by
her
kind
reception
the
room
was
in
utter
confusion
the
covered
with
powder
hairpins
bows
of
different
colored
ribbon
and
various
bits
of
jewelry
the
hearth
unswept
the
workstand
groaning
beneath
the
superincumbent
mass
of
sewing
finished
and
unfinished
garments
working
materials
and
to
crown
the
whole
the
winter
hat
a
girl
apparently
about
thirteen
years
of
age
was
seated
by
the
fire
busily
embroidering
a
another
some
six
years
younger
was
dressing
a
doll
while
an
infant
five
or
six
months
old
crawled
about
the
carpet
eagerly
picking
up
pins
needles
and
every
other
objectionable
article
his
little
purple
fingers
could
grasp
take
him
beulah
said
the
mother
she
stooped
to
comply
and
was
surprised
that
the
little
fellow
testified
no
fear
of
her
she
raised
him
in
her
arms
and
kissed
his
rosy
cheeks
as
he
looked
wonderingly
at
her
ma
is
that
johnny
new
nurse
what
is
her
name
said
the
youngest
girl
laying
down
her
doll
and
carefully
surveying
the
stranger
yes
annie
and
her
name
is
beulah
replied
the
mother
adjusting
her
bonnet
beulah
it
about
as
pretty
as
her
face
yes
just
about
continued
annie
in
an
audible
whisper
to
her
sister
the
latter
gave
beulah
a
condescending
stare
curled
her
lips
disdainfully
and
with
a
polite
mind
your
own
business
annie
returned
to
her
embroidery
keep
the
baby
by
the
fire
and
if
he
frets
you
must
feed
him
laura
show
her
where
to
find
his
cup
of
arrowroot
and
you
and
annie
stay
here
till
i
come
home
no
indeed
ma
i
ca
for
i
must
go
down
and
practice
my
music
lesson
answered
the
eldest
daughter
decisively
well
then
annie
stay
in
my
room
i
am
going
to
make
some
ma
she
pointing
to
beulah
can
take
care
of
johnny
i
thought
that
was
what
you
hired
her
for
you
will
make
no
till
i
come
home
miss
annie
do
you
hear
that
now
mind
what
i
said
to
you
martin
rustled
out
of
the
room
leaving
annie
to
scowl
ominously
at
the
new
nurse
and
vent
her
spleen
by
boxing
her
doll
because
the
inanimate
little
lady
would
not
keep
her
eyes
open
beulah
loved
children
and
johnny
forcibly
reminded
her
of
earlier
days
when
she
had
carried
lilly
about
in
her
arms
for
some
time
after
the
departure
of
martin
and
laura
the
little
fellow
seemed
perfectly
satisfied
but
finally
grew
fretful
and
beulah
surmised
he
might
be
hungry
will
you
please
give
me
the
baby
arrowroot
i
do
know
anything
about
it
ask
harrison
who
is
harrison
why
the
cook
glancing
around
the
room
she
found
the
arrowroot
the
boy
was
fed
and
soon
fell
asleep
beulah
sat
in
a
low
by
the
hearth
holding
the
infant
and
watching
the
little
figure
opposite
annie
was
trying
to
fit
a
new
silk
waist
to
her
doll
but
it
was
too
broad
one
way
and
too
narrow
another
she
twisted
and
jerked
it
divers
ways
but
all
in
vain
and
at
last
disgusted
by
the
experiment
she
tore
it
off
and
aimed
it
at
the
fire
with
an
impatient
cry
the
plagued
bothering
ugly
thing
my
lucia
never
shall
wear
such
a
fit
beulah
caught
the
discarded
waist
and
said
quietly
you
can
very
easily
make
it
fit
by
taking
up
this
seam
and
cutting
it
out
in
the
neck
i
do
believe
it
then
hand
me
the
doll
and
the
scissors
and
i
will
show
you
her
name
is
miss
green
named
her
say
call
her
by
her
proper
name
answered
the
spoiled
child
handing
over
the
unfortunate
waxen
representative
of
a
not
less
unfortunate
heroine
well
then
miss
said
beulah
smiling
a
few
alterations
reduced
the
dress
to
proper
dimensions
and
annie
arrayed
her
favorite
in
it
with
no
slight
degree
of
satisfaction
the
obliging
manner
of
the
new
nurse
won
her
heart
and
she
began
to
chat
pleasantly
enough
about
two
martin
returned
inquired
after
johnny
and
again
absented
herself
to
see
about
dinner
beulah
was
very
weary
of
the
close
disordered
room
and
as
the
babe
amused
himself
with
his
ivory
rattle
she
swept
the
floor
dusted
the
furniture
and
arranged
the
chairs
the
loud
ringing
of
a
bell
startled
her
and
she
conjectured
dinner
was
ready
some
time
elapsed
before
any
of
the
family
returned
and
then
laura
entered
looking
very
sullen
she
took
charge
of
the
babe
and
rather
ungraciously
desired
the
nurse
to
get
her
dinner
i
do
not
wish
any
answered
beulah
at
this
stage
of
the
conversation
the
door
opened
and
a
boy
seemingly
about
eugene
age
entered
the
room
he
looked
curiously
at
beulah
inclined
his
head
slightly
and
joined
his
sister
at
the
fire
how
do
you
like
her
laura
he
asked
in
a
distinct
undertone
oh
i
suppose
she
will
do
well
enough
but
she
is
horribly
ugly
replied
laura
in
a
similar
key
i
do
know
sis
it
is
what
patton
the
lecturer
on
physiognomy
would
call
a
face
yes
strikingly
ugly
dick
her
forehead
juts
over
like
the
eaves
of
the
kitchen
and
her
eyebrows
hush
she
will
hear
you
come
down
and
play
that
new
waltz
for
me
like
a
good
sister
the
two
left
the
room
beulah
had
heard
every
word
she
could
not
avoid
it
and
as
she
recalled
remark
concerning
her
appearance
on
the
previous
day
her
countenance
reflected
her
intense
mortification
she
pressed
her
face
against
the
and
stared
vacantly
out
the
elevated
position
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
town
and
on
the
eastern
horizon
the
blue
waters
of
the
harbor
glittered
with
silvery
sheen
at
any
other
time
and
with
different
emotions
love
of
the
beautiful
would
have
been
particularly
gratified
by
this
extended
prospect
but
now
the
whole
possessed
no
charms
for
her
darkened
spirit
for
the
moment
earth
was
to
her
gaze
she
only
saw
horribly
ugly
inscribed
on
sky
and
water
her
soul
seemed
to
leap
forward
and
view
nearer
the
myriad
motes
that
floated
in
the
haze
of
the
future
she
leaned
over
the
vast
whirring
lottery
wheel
of
life
and
saw
a
blank
come
up
with
her
name
stamped
upon
it
but
the
grim
smile
faded
from
her
lips
and
brave
endurance
looked
out
from
the
large
sad
eyes
as
she
murmured
be
not
like
dumb
driven
cattle
be
a
hero
in
the
strife
if
i
am
ugly
god
made
me
so
and
i
know
doeth
all
things
well
i
will
not
let
it
bother
me
i
will
try
not
to
think
of
it
but
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
thank
god
that
he
made
my
lilly
beautiful
she
will
never
have
to
suffer
as
i
do
now
my
own
darling
lilly
large
drops
glistened
in
her
eyes
she
rarely
wept
but
though
the
tears
did
not
fall
they
gathered
often
in
the
gray
depths
the
evening
passed
very
quietly
martin
was
absent
in
a
distant
state
whither
as
traveling
agent
for
a
mercantile
house
he
was
often
called
after
tea
when
little
johnny
had
been
put
to
sleep
in
his
crib
martin
directed
annie
to
show
the
nurse
her
own
room
taking
a
candle
the
child
complied
and
her
mother
ordered
one
of
the
servants
to
carry
up
the
trunk
containing
beulah
clothes
up
up
two
weary
winding
flights
of
steps
the
little
annie
toiled
and
pausing
at
the
landing
of
the
second
pointed
to
a
low
attic
chamber
lighted
by
dormer
windows
on
the
east
and
west
the
floor
was
uncovered
the
furniture
consisted
of
a
narrow
a
washstand
a
cracked
suspended
from
a
nail
a
small
deal
table
and
a
couple
of
chairs
there
were
also
some
hooks
driven
into
the
wall
to
hang
clothes
upon
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
sleep
here
because
the
boarders
occupy
the
rooms
on
the
floor
below
this
and
besides
you
know
robbers
never
get
up
to
the
garret
said
annie
glancing
around
the
apartment
and
shivering
with
an
undefined
dread
rather
than
with
cold
though
her
nose
and
fingers
were
purple
and
this
garret
chamber
possessed
neither
stove
nor
chimney
i
am
not
afraid
but
this
is
only
one
garret
room
are
the
others
occupied
yes
by
carpets
in
summer
and
rats
in
winter
laughed
annie
i
suppose
i
may
have
a
candle
said
beulah
as
the
porter
deposited
her
trunk
and
withdrew
yes
this
one
is
for
you
ma
is
always
uneasy
about
fire
so
set
anything
in
a
blaze
to
keep
yourself
warm
here
hold
the
light
at
the
top
of
the
steps
till
i
get
down
to
the
next
floor
then
there
is
a
beulah
bolted
the
door
and
surveyed
her
new
apartment
certainly
it
was
sufficiently
cheerless
but
its
isolated
position
presented
to
her
a
redeeming
feature
thought
she
i
can
sit
up
here
and
read
just
as
late
as
i
please
oh
i
shall
have
so
much
time
to
myself
these
long
long
nights
unpacking
her
trunk
she
hung
her
dresses
on
the
hooks
placed
the
books
mason
and
eugene
had
given
her
on
the
table
and
setting
the
candle
beside
them
smiled
in
anticipation
of
the
many
treats
in
store
for
her
she
read
several
chapters
in
her
bible
and
then
as
her
head
ached
and
her
eyes
grew
heavy
she
sank
upon
her
knees
ah
what
an
earnest
touching
petition
ascended
to
the
throne
of
the
father
prayers
first
for
lilly
and
claudia
and
lastly
for
herself
help
me
o
lord
not
to
be
troubled
and
angry
when
i
hear
that
i
am
so
ugly
and
make
me
remember
that
i
am
your
child
such
was
her
final
request
and
she
soon
slept
soundly
regardless
of
the
fact
that
she
was
now
thrown
upon
the
wide
though
not
altogether
cold
or
unloving
world
chapter
iv
day
after
day
passed
monotonously
and
except
a
visit
from
eugene
there
was
no
link
added
to
the
chain
which
bound
beulah
to
the
past
that
brief
visit
encouraged
and
cheered
the
lonely
heart
yearning
for
affectionate
sympathy
yet
striving
to
hush
the
hungry
cry
and
grow
contented
with
its
lot
during
the
second
week
of
her
stay
little
johnny
was
taken
sick
and
he
had
become
so
fond
of
his
new
attendant
that
no
one
else
was
permitted
to
hold
him
often
she
paced
the
chamber
floor
for
hours
lulling
the
fretful
babe
with
softly
sung
tunes
of
other
days
and
the
close
observer
who
could
have
peered
at
such
times
into
the
downcast
eyes
might
have
easily
traced
in
the
misty
depths
memories
that
nestled
in
her
sanctuary
the
infant
soon
recovered
and
one
warm
sunny
afternoon
when
martin
directed
beulah
to
draw
him
in
his
wicker
carriage
up
and
down
the
pavement
before
the
door
she
could
no
longer
repress
the
request
which
had
trembled
on
her
lips
more
than
once
and
asked
permission
to
take
her
little
charge
to
grayson
a
rather
reluctant
assent
was
given
and
soon
the
carriage
was
drawn
in
the
direction
of
grayson
elegant
city
residence
a
marvelous
change
came
over
the
wan
face
of
the
nurse
as
she
paused
at
the
marble
steps
guarded
on
either
side
by
sculptured
lions
to
see
lilly
the
blood
sprang
to
her
cheeks
and
an
eager
look
of
delight
crept
into
the
eyes
the
door
was
partially
opened
by
an
footman
whose
hasty
glance
led
him
to
suppose
her
one
of
the
numerous
supplicants
for
charity
who
generally
left
that
princely
mansion
as
as
they
came
he
was
about
to
close
the
door
but
undaunted
by
this
reception
she
hastily
asked
to
see
grayson
and
lillian
benton
grayson
is
engaged
and
there
is
no
such
person
here
as
lillian
benton
miss
lilly
grayson
is
my
young
mistress
name
but
i
can
tell
you
her
mamma
do
suffer
her
to
see
the
like
of
you
so
be
off
lilly
is
my
sister
and
i
must
see
her
tell
grayson
beulah
benton
wishes
to
see
her
sister
and
ask
her
also
if
claudia
may
not
see
me
she
dropped
the
tongue
of
the
carriage
and
the
thin
hands
clutched
each
other
in
an
agony
of
dread
lest
her
petition
should
be
refused
the
succeeding
five
minutes
seemed
an
eternity
to
her
and
as
the
door
opened
again
she
leaned
forward
and
held
her
breath
like
one
whose
fate
was
in
the
balance
costly
silk
and
dazzling
diamonds
met
her
gaze
the
settled
lines
of
grayson
pretty
mouth
indicated
that
she
had
a
disagreeable
duty
to
perform
yet
had
resolved
to
do
it
at
once
and
set
the
matter
forever
at
rest
you
are
martin
nurse
i
believe
and
the
girl
i
saw
at
the
asylum
said
she
frigidly
yes
madam
i
am
lilly
sister
you
said
i
might
come
and
see
her
oh
if
you
only
knew
how
miserable
i
have
been
since
we
were
parted
you
would
not
look
so
coldly
at
me
do
please
let
me
see
her
oh
do
deny
me
these
words
were
uttered
in
a
tone
of
imploring
agony
i
am
very
sorry
you
happen
to
be
her
sister
and
i
assure
you
child
it
pains
me
to
refuse
you
but
when
you
remember
the
circumstances
you
ought
not
to
expect
to
associate
with
her
as
you
used
to
do
she
will
be
educated
to
move
in
a
circle
very
far
above
you
and
you
ought
to
be
more
than
willing
to
give
her
up
when
you
know
how
lucky
she
has
been
in
securing
a
home
of
wealth
besides
she
is
getting
over
the
separation
very
nicely
indeed
and
if
she
were
to
see
you
even
once
it
would
make
matters
almost
as
bad
as
ever
i
dare
say
you
are
a
good
girl
and
will
not
trouble
me
any
further
my
husband
and
i
are
unwilling
that
you
should
see
lilly
again
and
though
i
am
very
sorry
i
am
forced
to
disappoint
you
i
feel
that
i
am
doing
right
the
petitioner
fell
on
her
knees
and
extending
her
arms
said
huskily
oh
madam
are
we
to
be
parted
forever
i
pray
you
in
the
name
of
god
let
me
see
her
let
me
see
her
grayson
was
not
a
cruel
woman
far
from
it
but
she
was
strangely
weak
and
worldly
the
idea
of
a
hired
nurse
associating
familiarly
with
her
adopted
daughter
was
repulsive
to
her
aristocratic
pride
and
therefore
she
hushed
the
tones
of
true
womanly
sympathy
and
answered
resolutely
it
pains
me
to
refuse
you
but
i
have
given
good
reasons
and
can
not
think
of
changing
my
determination
i
hope
you
will
not
annoy
me
by
any
future
efforts
to
enter
my
house
there
is
a
present
for
you
she
tossed
a
gold
piece
toward
the
kneeling
figure
and
closing
the
door
locked
it
on
the
inside
the
money
rolled
ringingly
down
the
steps
and
the
grating
sound
of
the
key
as
it
was
hurriedly
turned
seemed
typical
of
the
unyielding
lock
which
now
forever
barred
the
child
hopes
the
look
of
utter
despair
gave
place
to
an
expression
of
indescribable
bitterness
springing
from
her
suppliant
posture
she
muttered
with
terrible
emphasis
a
curse
on
that
woman
and
her
husband
may
god
answer
their
prayers
as
she
has
answered
mine
picking
up
the
coin
which
lay
glittering
on
the
sidewalk
she
threw
it
forcibly
against
the
door
and
as
it
rebounded
into
the
street
took
the
carriage
tongue
and
slowly
retraced
her
steps
it
was
not
surprising
that
gazed
curiously
at
the
stony
face
with
its
large
eyes
brimful
of
burning
hate
as
the
injured
orphan
walked
mechanically
on
unconscious
that
her
lips
were
crushed
till
purple
drops
oozed
over
them
the
setting
sun
flashed
his
ruddy
beams
caressingly
over
her
brow
and
whispering
winds
lifted
tenderly
the
clustering
folds
of
jetty
hair
but
nature
hearted
darling
had
stood
over
the
noxious
tarn
whence
the
poisonous
breath
of
a
corrupt
humanity
rolled
upward
and
the
once
sinless
child
inhaled
the
vapor
until
her
soul
was
a
great
boiling
marah
ah
truly
there
are
swift
hours
in
life
strong
rushing
hours
that
do
the
work
of
tempests
in
their
might
peaceful
valleys
green
and
flowery
sleeping
in
loveliness
have
been
unheaved
and
piled
in
somber
jagged
masses
against
the
sky
by
the
fingering
of
an
earthquake
and
gentle
loving
trusting
hearts
over
whose
altars
brooded
the
messengers
of
god
peace
have
been
as
suddenly
transformed
by
a
manifestation
of
selfishness
and
injustice
into
gloomy
haunts
of
misanthropy
had
grayson
been
arraigned
for
cruelty
or
before
a
tribunal
of
her
equals
fashionable
friends
the
charge
would
have
been
scornfully
repelled
and
unanimous
would
have
been
her
acquittal
oh
no
she
was
only
prudent
and
wise
who
could
expect
her
to
suffer
her
pampered
inert
darling
to
meet
and
acknowledge
as
an
equal
the
far
less
daintily
fed
and
elegantly
clad
sister
whom
god
called
to
labor
for
her
frugal
meals
ah
this
this
ignoring
of
labor
to
which
in
accordance
with
the
divine
decree
all
should
be
subjected
this
and
miserable
affectation
of
refinement
which
characterizes
the
age
is
the
unyielding
lock
on
the
wheels
of
social
reform
and
advancement
beulah
took
her
charge
home
and
when
dusk
came
on
rocked
him
to
sleep
and
snugly
folded
the
covering
of
his
crib
over
the
little
throbbing
heart
whose
hours
of
trial
were
yet
veiled
by
the
impenetrable
curtain
of
futurity
martin
and
her
elder
children
had
gone
to
a
concert
and
of
course
the
nurse
was
to
remain
with
johnny
until
his
mother
return
standing
beside
the
crib
and
gazing
down
at
the
rosy
cheeks
and
curling
locks
nestled
against
the
pillow
beulah
thoughts
winged
along
the
past
to
the
hour
when
lilly
had
been
placed
in
her
arms
by
emaciated
hands
stiffening
in
death
for
six
years
she
had
held
and
hushed
and
caressed
her
dying
father
last
charge
and
now
strange
ruthless
fingers
had
torn
the
clinging
from
the
idol
there
were
no
sobs
nor
groans
to
voice
the
anguish
of
the
desolate
orphan
the
glittering
eyes
were
tearless
but
the
brow
was
darkly
furrowed
the
ashy
lips
writhed
and
the
folded
hands
were
purple
from
compression
turning
from
the
crib
she
threw
up
the
sash
and
seated
herself
on
the
below
lay
the
city
with
its
countless
lamps
gleaming
in
every
direction
and
stretching
away
on
the
principal
streets
like
long
processions
in
the
distance
the
dark
waters
of
the
river
over
which
steamboat
lights
flashed
now
and
then
like
ignesfatui
and
above
her
arched
the
dome
of
sky
with
its
fiery
fretwork
never
before
had
she
looked
up
at
the
starry
groups
without
an
emotion
of
exulting
joy
of
awful
adoration
to
her
worshiping
gaze
they
had
seemed
glimpses
of
the
spirit
home
nay
loving
eyes
shining
down
upon
her
thorny
pathway
but
now
the
twinkling
rays
fell
unheeded
impotent
to
pierce
the
sable
clouds
of
grief
she
sat
looking
out
into
the
night
with
strained
eyes
that
seemed
fastened
upon
a
corpse
an
hour
passed
thus
and
as
the
clang
of
the
town
clock
died
away
the
shrill
voice
of
the
watchman
rang
through
the
air
nine
and
all
well
beulah
lifted
her
head
and
listened
all
well
the
mockery
maddened
her
and
she
muttered
audibly
that
is
the
sort
of
sympathy
i
shall
have
through
life
i
am
to
hear
that
is
well
when
my
heart
is
dying
nay
dead
within
me
oh
if
i
could
only
die
what
a
calm
calm
time
i
should
have
in
my
coffin
nobody
to
taunt
me
with
my
poverty
and
ugliness
oh
what
did
god
make
me
for
the
few
years
of
my
life
have
been
full
of
misery
i
can
not
remember
one
single
day
of
pure
happiness
for
there
was
always
something
to
spoil
what
little
joy
i
ever
knew
when
i
was
born
why
did
not
i
die
at
once
and
why
did
not
god
take
me
instead
of
my
dear
dear
father
he
should
have
been
left
with
lilly
for
people
love
the
beautiful
but
nobody
will
ever
care
for
me
i
am
of
no
use
to
anything
and
so
ugly
that
i
hate
myself
o
lord
i
do
want
to
live
another
day
i
am
sick
of
my
life
take
me
take
me
but
a
feeble
ray
of
comfort
stole
into
her
shivering
heart
as
she
bowed
her
head
upon
her
hands
eugene
graham
loved
her
and
the
bleeding
tendrils
of
affection
henceforth
clasped
him
as
their
only
support
she
was
aroused
from
her
painful
reverie
by
a
movement
in
the
crib
and
hastening
to
her
charge
was
startled
by
the
appearance
of
the
babe
the
soft
blue
eyes
were
rolled
up
and
set
the
face
of
a
purplish
hue
and
the
delicate
limbs
convulsed
during
her
residence
at
the
asylum
she
had
more
than
once
assisted
the
matron
in
nursing
children
similarly
affected
and
now
calling
instantly
for
a
tub
of
water
she
soon
immersed
the
rigid
limbs
in
a
warm
bath
while
one
of
the
waiters
was
dispatched
for
the
family
physician
when
hartwell
entered
he
found
her
standing
with
the
infant
clasped
in
her
arms
and
as
his
eyes
rested
curiously
upon
her
face
she
forgot
that
he
was
a
stranger
and
springing
to
meet
him
exclaimed
oh
sir
will
he
die
with
his
fingers
on
the
bounding
pulse
he
answered
he
is
very
where
is
his
mother
who
are
you
his
mother
is
at
a
concert
and
i
am
his
nurse
the
spasms
had
ceased
but
the
twitching
limbs
told
that
they
might
return
any
moment
and
the
physician
immediately
administered
a
potion
how
long
will
martin
be
absent
it
is
uncertain
when
shall
i
give
the
medicine
again
i
shall
remain
until
she
comes
home
beulah
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
floor
with
johnny
in
her
arms
hartwell
stood
on
the
hearth
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
and
watching
the
slight
form
as
it
stole
softly
to
and
fro
gradually
the
child
became
quiet
but
his
nurse
kept
up
her
walk
hartwell
said
abruptly
sit
down
girl
you
will
walk
yourself
into
a
shadow
she
lifted
her
head
shook
it
in
reply
and
resumed
her
measured
tread
what
is
your
name
beulah
benton
beulah
repeated
the
doctor
while
a
smile
flitted
over
his
mustached
lip
she
observed
it
and
exclaimed
with
bitter
emphasis
you
need
not
tell
me
it
is
unsuitable
i
know
it
i
feel
it
beulah
beulah
oh
my
father
i
have
neither
sunshine
nor
flowers
nor
hear
the
singing
of
birds
nor
the
voice
of
the
turtle
you
ought
to
have
called
me
marah
you
have
read
the
progress
then
said
he
with
a
searching
glance
either
she
did
not
hear
him
or
was
too
entirely
engrossed
by
painful
reflection
to
frame
an
answer
the
despairing
expression
settled
upon
her
face
and
the
broken
threads
of
memory
wove
on
again
beulah
how
came
you
here
in
the
capacity
of
nurse
i
was
driven
here
by
necessity
where
are
your
parents
and
friends
i
have
none
i
am
alone
in
the
world
how
long
have
you
been
so
dependent
she
raised
her
hand
deprecatingly
nay
commandingly
as
though
she
had
said
no
more
you
have
not
the
right
to
question
nor
i
the
will
to
answer
he
marked
the
look
of
unconquerable
grief
and
understanding
her
gesture
made
no
more
inquiries
soon
after
martin
returned
and
having
briefly
stated
what
had
occurred
and
given
directions
for
the
child
treatment
he
withdrew
his
low
gently
spoken
to
the
nurse
was
only
acknowledged
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
as
he
passed
her
little
johnny
was
restless
and
constantly
threatened
with
a
return
of
the
convulsions
his
mother
held
him
on
her
knee
and
telling
beulah
she
had
been
a
good
sensible
girl
to
bathe
him
so
promptly
gave
her
permission
to
retire
i
am
not
at
all
sleepy
and
would
rather
stay
here
and
nurse
him
he
does
not
moan
so
much
when
i
walk
with
him
give
him
back
to
me
but
you
will
be
tired
out
i
shall
not
mind
it
stooping
down
she
lifted
the
restless
boy
and
wrapping
his
cloak
about
him
commenced
the
same
noiseless
tread
thus
the
night
waned
occasionally
martin
rose
and
felt
her
babe
pulse
and
assisted
in
giving
the
hourly
potions
then
reseated
herself
and
allowed
the
hireling
to
walk
on
once
she
offered
to
relieve
her
but
the
arms
refused
to
yield
their
burden
a
little
after
four
the
mother
slept
soundly
in
her
chair
gradually
the
stars
grew
dim
and
the
long
undulating
chain
of
clouds
that
girded
the
eastern
horizon
kindled
into
a
pale
orange
that
transformed
them
into
mountains
of
topaz
pausing
by
the
window
and
gazing
vacantly
out
beulah
eyes
were
suddenly
riveted
on
the
gorgeous
pageant
which
untiring
nature
daily
renews
and
she
stood
watching
the
masses
of
vapor
painted
by
coming
sunlight
and
floating
slowly
before
the
wind
until
the
king
of
day
flashed
up
and
dazzled
her
martin
was
awakened
by
the
entrance
of
a
servant
and
starting
up
exclaimed
bless
me
i
have
been
asleep
beulah
how
is
johnny
you
must
be
tired
to
death
he
is
sleeping
now
very
quietly
i
think
he
is
better
his
fever
is
not
so
high
i
will
take
care
of
him
and
you
had
better
take
another
nap
before
breakfast
martin
obeyed
the
nurse
injunction
and
it
was
two
hours
later
when
she
took
her
child
and
directed
beulah
to
get
her
breakfast
but
the
weary
girl
felt
no
desire
for
the
meal
and
retiring
to
her
attic
room
bathed
her
eyes
and
replaited
her
hair
kneeling
beside
her
bed
she
tried
to
pray
but
the
words
died
on
her
lips
and
too
miserable
to
frame
a
petition
she
returned
to
the
chamber
where
in
sad
vigils
she
had
spent
the
night
hartwell
bowed
as
she
entered
but
the
head
was
bent
down
and
without
glancing
at
him
she
took
the
fretful
suffering
child
and
walked
to
the
window
while
she
stood
there
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
loved
face
of
her
best
friend
eugene
graham
was
crossing
the
street
for
an
instant
the
burning
blood
surged
over
her
wan
sickly
cheeks
and
the
pale
lips
parted
in
a
smile
of
delight
as
she
leaned
forward
to
see
whether
he
was
coming
in
the
door
bell
rang
and
she
sprang
from
the
window
unconscious
of
the
piercing
eyes
fastened
upon
her
hastily
laying
little
johnny
on
his
mother
lap
she
merely
said
i
will
be
back
soon
and
darting
down
the
steps
met
eugene
at
the
entrance
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
hiding
her
face
on
his
shoulder
what
is
the
matter
beulah
do
tell
me
said
he
anxiously
briefly
she
related
her
fruitless
attempt
to
see
lilly
and
pointed
out
the
nature
of
the
barrier
which
must
forever
separate
them
eugene
listened
with
flashing
eyes
and
several
times
the
word
brutal
escaped
his
lips
he
endeavored
to
comfort
her
by
holding
out
hopes
of
brighter
days
but
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
shadows
and
his
cheering
words
failed
to
call
up
a
smile
they
stood
in
the
hall
near
the
front
door
and
here
hartwell
found
them
when
he
left
the
sickroom
eugene
looked
up
as
he
approached
them
and
stepped
forward
with
a
smile
of
recognition
to
shake
the
extended
hand
beulah
countenance
became
instantly
repellent
and
she
was
turning
away
when
the
doctor
addressed
her
you
must
feel
very
much
fatigued
from
being
up
all
night
i
know
from
your
looks
that
you
did
not
close
your
eyes
i
am
no
worse
looking
than
usual
thank
you
she
replied
icily
drawing
back
as
she
spoke
behind
eugene
the
doctor
left
them
and
as
his
buggy
rolled
from
the
door
beulah
seemed
to
breathe
freely
again
poor
child
her
sensitive
nature
had
so
often
been
deeply
wounded
by
the
thoughtless
remarks
of
strangers
that
she
began
to
shrink
from
all
observation
as
the
surest
mode
of
escaping
pain
eugene
noticed
her
manner
and
biting
his
lips
with
vexation
said
reprovingly
beulah
you
were
very
rude
to
hartwell
politeness
costs
nothing
and
you
might
at
least
have
answered
his
question
with
ordinary
civility
her
eyelids
drooped
and
a
tremor
passed
over
her
mouth
as
she
answered
meekly
i
did
not
intend
to
be
rude
but
i
dread
to
have
people
look
at
or
speak
to
me
why
pray
because
i
am
so
ugly
and
they
are
sure
to
show
me
that
they
see
it
he
drew
his
arm
protectingly
around
her
and
said
gently
poor
child
it
is
cruel
to
make
you
suffer
so
but
rest
assured
hartwell
will
never
wound
your
feelings
i
have
heard
that
he
was
a
very
stern
and
eccentric
man
though
a
remarkably
learned
one
yet
i
confess
there
is
something
in
his
manner
which
fascinates
me
and
if
you
will
only
be
like
yourself
he
will
always
speak
kindly
to
you
but
i
am
staying
too
long
do
look
so
forlorn
and
ghostly
positively
i
hate
to
come
to
see
you
for
somehow
your
wretched
face
haunts
me
here
is
a
book
i
have
just
finished
perhaps
it
will
serve
to
divert
your
mind
he
put
a
copy
of
irving
sketch
book
in
her
hand
and
drew
on
his
gloves
oh
eugene
ca
you
stay
a
little
longer
just
a
little
longer
it
seems
such
a
great
while
since
you
were
here
she
looked
up
wistfully
into
the
handsome
boyish
face
drawing
out
an
elegant
new
watch
he
held
it
before
her
eyes
and
answered
hurriedly
see
there
it
is
ten
and
i
am
behind
my
appointment
at
the
lecture
room
try
to
be
cheerful
ca
be
cured
must
be
endured
you
know
so
do
not
despond
dear
beulah
shaking
her
hand
cordially
he
ran
down
the
steps
the
orphan
pressed
her
hands
tightly
over
her
brow
as
if
to
stay
some
sudden
painful
thought
and
slowly
remounted
the
stairs
chapter
little
johnny
illness
proved
long
and
serious
and
for
many
days
and
nights
he
seemed
on
the
verge
of
the
tomb
his
wailings
were
never
hushed
except
in
beulah
arms
and
as
might
be
supposed
constant
watching
soon
converted
her
into
a
mere
shadow
of
her
former
self
hartwell
often
advised
rest
and
fresh
air
for
her
but
the
silent
shake
of
her
head
proved
how
reckless
she
was
of
her
own
welfare
thus
several
weeks
elapsed
and
gradually
the
sick
child
grew
stronger
one
afternoon
beulah
sat
holding
him
on
her
knee
he
had
fallen
asleep
with
one
tiny
hand
clasping
hers
and
while
he
slept
she
read
absorbed
in
the
volume
eugene
had
given
her
her
thoughts
wandered
on
with
the
author
amid
the
moldering
monuments
of
westminster
abbey
and
finally
the
sketch
was
concluded
by
that
solemn
paragraph
thus
man
passes
away
his
name
perishes
from
record
and
recollection
his
history
is
as
a
tale
that
is
told
and
his
very
monument
becomes
a
ruin
again
she
read
this
sad
comment
on
the
vanity
of
earth
and
its
ephemeral
hosts
and
her
mind
was
filled
with
weird
images
that
looked
out
from
her
earnest
eyes
hartwell
entered
unperceived
and
stood
for
some
moments
at
the
back
of
her
chair
glancing
over
her
shoulder
at
the
last
page
at
length
she
closed
the
book
and
passing
her
hand
wearily
over
her
eyes
said
audibly
ah
if
we
could
only
have
sat
down
together
in
that
gloomy
garret
and
had
a
long
talk
it
would
have
helped
us
both
poor
chatterton
i
know
just
how
you
felt
when
you
locked
your
door
and
lay
down
on
your
and
swallowed
your
last
draught
there
is
not
a
word
about
chatterton
in
that
sketch
said
the
doctor
she
started
looked
up
and
answered
slowly
no
not
a
word
not
a
word
he
was
buried
among
paupers
you
know
what
made
you
think
of
him
i
thought
that
instead
of
resting
in
the
abbey
under
sculptured
marble
his
bones
were
scattered
nobody
knows
where
i
often
think
of
him
why
because
he
was
so
miserable
and
because
sometimes
i
feel
exactly
as
he
did
as
she
uttered
these
words
she
compressed
her
lips
in
a
manner
which
plainly
said
there
i
have
no
more
to
say
so
do
not
question
me
he
had
learned
to
read
her
countenance
and
as
he
felt
the
pulse
pointed
to
the
crib
saying
you
must
lay
him
down
now
he
seems
fast
asleep
no
i
may
as
well
hold
him
girl
will
you
follow
my
directions
said
he
sharply
beulah
looked
up
at
him
for
a
moment
then
rose
and
placed
the
boy
in
his
crib
while
a
sort
of
grim
smile
distorted
her
features
the
doctor
mixed
some
medicine
and
setting
the
glass
on
the
table
put
both
hands
in
his
pockets
and
walked
up
to
the
nurse
her
head
was
averted
beulah
will
you
be
good
enough
to
look
at
me
she
fixed
her
eyes
proudly
on
his
and
her
beautiful
teeth
gleamed
through
the
parted
lips
do
you
know
that
eugene
is
going
away
very
soon
to
be
absent
at
least
five
years
an
incredulous
smile
flitted
over
her
face
but
the
ashen
hue
of
death
settled
there
i
am
in
earnest
he
leaves
for
europe
next
week
to
be
gone
a
long
time
she
extended
her
hands
pleadingly
and
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
are
you
sure
quite
sure
his
passage
is
already
engaged
in
a
packet
that
will
sail
early
next
week
what
will
become
of
you
in
his
absence
the
strained
eyes
met
his
vacantly
the
icy
hands
dropped
and
she
fell
forward
against
him
guy
hartwell
placed
the
slight
attenuated
form
on
the
sofa
and
stood
with
folded
arms
looking
down
at
the
colorless
face
his
high
white
brow
clouded
and
a
fierce
light
kindled
in
his
piercing
dark
eyes
as
through
closed
teeth
came
the
rather
indistinct
words
it
is
madness
to
indulge
the
thought
i
was
a
fool
to
dream
of
it
she
would
prove
heartless
like
all
of
her
sex
and
repay
me
with
black
ingratitude
let
her
fight
the
battle
of
life
unaided
he
sprinkled
a
handful
of
water
on
the
upturned
face
and
in
a
few
minutes
saw
the
eyelids
tremble
and
knew
from
the
look
of
suffering
that
with
returning
consciousness
came
the
keen
pangs
of
grief
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
after
a
little
while
asked
shall
i
ever
see
him
again
he
will
come
here
to
tell
you
about
his
trip
but
what
will
become
of
you
in
his
absence
answer
me
that
god
only
knows
hartwell
wrote
the
directions
for
johnny
medicine
and
placing
the
slip
of
paper
on
the
glass
took
his
hat
and
left
the
room
beulah
sat
with
her
head
pressed
against
the
foot
of
the
taking
no
note
of
the
lapse
of
time
twilight
gray
had
in
her
sober
livery
all
things
clad
the
room
had
grown
dark
save
where
a
mellow
ray
stole
through
the
western
window
beulah
rose
mechanically
lighted
the
lamp
and
shaded
it
so
as
to
shield
the
eyes
of
the
sleeping
boy
the
door
was
open
and
glancing
up
she
saw
eugene
on
the
threshold
her
arms
were
thrown
around
him
with
a
low
cry
of
mingled
joy
and
grief
oh
eugene
please
do
leave
me
whom
have
i
in
the
world
but
you
beulah
dear
i
must
go
only
think
of
the
privilege
of
being
at
a
german
university
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
piece
of
good
luck
do
cry
so
i
shall
come
back
some
of
these
days
such
an
erudite
such
an
elegant
young
man
you
will
hardly
know
me
only
five
years
i
am
almost
seventeen
now
time
passes
very
quickly
and
you
will
scarcely
miss
me
before
i
shall
be
at
home
again
he
lifted
up
her
face
and
laughed
gayly
as
he
spoke
when
are
you
to
go
the
vessel
sails
wednesday
three
days
from
now
i
shall
be
very
busy
until
then
beulah
what
glorious
letters
i
shall
write
you
from
the
old
world
i
am
to
see
all
europe
before
i
return
that
is
my
father
says
i
shall
he
is
coming
on
in
two
or
three
years
with
cornelia
and
we
are
all
to
travel
together
wo
it
be
glorious
yes
for
you
but
eugene
my
heart
seems
to
die
when
i
think
of
those
coming
five
years
how
shall
i
live
without
you
oh
what
shall
i
do
there
beulah
do
not
look
so
wretched
you
will
have
a
thousand
things
to
divert
your
mind
my
father
says
he
will
see
that
you
are
sent
to
the
public
school
you
know
the
tuition
is
free
and
he
thinks
he
can
find
some
good
kind
family
where
you
will
be
taken
care
of
till
your
education
is
finished
your
studies
will
occupy
you
closely
and
you
will
have
quite
enough
to
think
of
without
troubling
yourself
about
my
absence
of
course
you
will
write
to
me
constantly
and
each
letter
will
be
like
having
a
nice
quiet
chat
together
oh
dear
ca
you
get
up
a
smile
and
look
less
forlorn
you
never
would
look
on
the
bright
side
because
i
never
had
any
to
look
on
except
you
and
lilly
and
when
you
are
gone
everything
will
be
dark
dark
she
groaned
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
not
unless
you
determine
to
make
it
so
if
i
did
not
know
that
my
father
would
attend
to
your
education
i
should
not
be
so
delighted
to
go
certainly
beulah
in
improving
yourself
you
will
have
very
little
leisure
to
sit
down
and
repine
that
your
lot
is
not
among
the
brightest
do
try
to
hope
that
things
may
change
for
the
better
if
they
do
not
why
i
shall
not
spend
eternity
in
europe
and
when
i
come
home
of
course
i
shall
take
care
of
you
myself
she
stood
with
one
hand
resting
on
his
arm
and
while
he
talked
on
carelessly
of
her
future
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
countenance
thinking
of
the
desolate
hours
in
store
for
her
when
the
mighty
atlantic
billows
surged
between
her
and
the
noble
classic
face
she
loved
so
devotedly
a
shadowy
panorama
of
coming
years
glided
before
her
and
trailing
clouds
seemed
gathered
about
the
path
her
little
feet
must
tread
a
vague
foreboding
discovered
to
her
the
cheerlessness
and
she
shivered
in
anticipating
the
dreariness
that
awaited
her
but
there
was
time
enough
for
the
raging
of
the
storm
why
rush
so
eagerly
to
meet
it
she
closed
her
eyes
to
shut
out
the
grim
vision
and
listened
resolutely
to
the
plans
suggested
for
her
approval
when
eugene
rose
to
say
it
was
touching
to
note
the
efforts
she
made
to
appear
hopeful
the
sob
swallowed
lest
it
should
displease
him
the
trembling
lips
forced
into
a
smile
and
the
heavy
eyelids
lifted
bravely
to
meet
his
glance
when
the
door
closed
after
his
retreating
form
the
hands
were
clasped
convulsively
and
the
white
tearless
face
mutely
revealed
the
desolation
which
that
loving
heart
locked
in
its
darkened
chambers
chapter
vi
several
tedious
weeks
had
rolled
away
since
eugene
graham
left
his
sunny
southern
home
to
seek
learning
in
the
venerable
universities
of
the
old
world
may
the
carnival
month
of
the
year
had
clothed
the
earth
with
verdure
and
enameled
it
with
flowers
of
every
hue
scattering
her
treasures
before
the
rushing
car
of
summer
during
the
winter
scarlet
fever
had
hovered
threateningly
over
the
city
but
as
the
spring
advanced
hopes
were
entertained
that
all
danger
had
passed
consequently
when
it
was
announced
that
the
disease
had
made
its
appearance
in
a
very
malignant
form
in
the
house
adjoining
martin
she
determined
to
send
her
children
immediately
out
of
town
a
relative
living
at
some
distance
up
the
river
happened
to
be
visiting
her
at
the
time
and
as
she
intended
returning
home
the
following
day
kindly
offered
to
take
charge
of
the
children
until
all
traces
of
the
disease
had
vanished
to
this
plan
beulah
made
no
resistance
though
the
memory
of
her
little
sister
haunted
her
hourly
what
could
she
do
make
one
last
attempt
to
see
her
and
if
again
refused
then
it
mattered
not
whither
she
went
when
the
preparations
for
their
journey
had
been
completed
and
johnny
slept
soundly
in
his
crib
beulah
put
on
her
old
straw
bonnet
and
set
out
for
grayson
residence
the
sun
was
low
in
the
sky
and
the
evening
breeze
rippling
the
waters
of
the
bay
stirred
the
luxuriant
foliage
of
the
ancient
china
trees
that
bordered
the
pavements
the
orphan
heart
was
heavy
with
undefined
dread
such
a
dread
as
had
oppressed
her
the
day
of
her
separation
from
her
sister
coming
events
cast
their
shadows
before
and
she
was
conscious
that
the
sunset
glow
could
not
dispel
the
spectral
gloom
which
enveloped
her
she
walked
on
with
her
head
bowed
like
one
stooping
from
an
impending
blow
and
when
at
last
the
crouching
lions
confronted
her
she
felt
as
if
her
heart
had
suddenly
frozen
there
stood
the
doctor
buggy
she
sprang
up
the
steps
and
stretched
out
her
hand
for
the
bolt
of
the
door
long
streamers
of
crape
floated
through
her
fingers
she
stood
still
a
moment
then
threw
open
the
door
and
rushed
in
the
hall
floor
was
covered
to
muffle
the
tread
not
a
sound
reached
her
save
the
stirring
of
the
china
trees
outside
her
hand
was
on
the
balustrade
to
ascend
the
steps
but
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
piece
of
crape
fastened
to
the
parlor
door
and
pushing
it
ajar
she
looked
in
the
furniture
was
draped
even
the
mirrors
and
pictures
and
on
a
small
oblong
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
lay
a
shrouded
form
an
perfume
of
crushed
flowers
filled
the
air
and
beulah
stood
on
the
threshold
with
her
hands
extended
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
table
there
were
two
children
lilly
might
yet
live
and
an
unvoiced
prayer
went
up
to
god
that
the
dead
might
be
claudia
then
like
scathing
lightning
came
the
recollection
of
her
curse
may
god
answer
their
prayers
as
they
answered
mine
with
rigid
limbs
she
tottered
to
the
table
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
velvet
pall
with
closed
eyes
she
drew
it
down
then
held
her
breath
and
looked
there
lay
her
idol
in
the
marble
arms
of
death
ah
how
matchlessly
beautiful
wrapped
in
her
last
sleep
the
bright
golden
curls
glittered
around
the
snowy
brow
and
floated
like
wandering
sunlight
over
the
arms
and
shoulders
the
tiny
waxen
fingers
clasped
each
other
as
in
life
and
the
delicately
chiseled
lips
were
just
parted
as
though
the
sleeper
whispered
beulah
gaze
dwelt
upon
this
mocking
loveliness
then
the
arms
were
thrown
wildly
up
and
with
a
long
wailing
cry
her
head
sank
heavily
on
the
velvet
cushion
beside
the
cold
face
of
her
dead
darling
how
long
it
rested
there
she
never
knew
earth
seemed
to
pass
away
darkness
closed
over
her
and
for
a
time
she
had
no
pain
no
sorrow
she
and
lilly
were
together
all
was
black
and
she
had
no
feeling
then
she
was
lifted
and
the
motion
aroused
her
torpid
faculties
she
moaned
and
opened
her
eyes
hartwell
was
placing
her
on
a
sofa
and
grayson
stood
by
the
table
with
a
handkerchief
over
her
eyes
with
returning
consciousness
came
a
raving
despair
beulah
sprang
from
the
strong
arm
that
strove
to
detain
her
and
laying
one
clinched
hand
on
the
folded
fingers
of
the
dead
raised
the
other
fiercely
toward
grayson
and
exclaimed
almost
frantically
you
have
murdered
her
i
knew
it
would
be
so
when
you
took
my
darling
from
my
arms
and
refused
my
prayer
aye
my
prayer
i
knelt
and
prayed
you
in
the
name
of
god
to
let
me
see
her
once
more
to
let
me
hold
her
to
my
heart
and
kiss
her
lips
and
forehead
and
little
slender
hands
you
scorned
a
poor
girl
prayer
you
taunted
me
with
my
poverty
and
locked
me
from
my
darling
my
lilly
my
all
oh
woman
you
drove
me
wild
and
i
cursed
you
and
your
husband
ha
has
your
wealth
and
splendor
saved
her
god
have
mercy
upon
me
i
feel
as
if
i
could
curse
you
eternally
could
you
not
have
sent
for
me
before
she
died
oh
if
i
could
only
have
taken
her
in
my
arms
and
seen
her
soft
angel
eyes
looking
up
to
me
and
felt
her
little
arms
around
my
neck
and
heard
her
say
for
the
last
time
would
it
have
taken
a
dime
from
your
purse
or
made
you
less
fashionable
to
have
sent
for
me
before
she
died
measure
as
ye
mete
shall
be
meted
to
you
again
may
you
live
to
have
your
heart
trampled
and
crushed
even
as
you
have
trampled
mine
her
arm
sank
to
her
side
and
once
more
the
blazing
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
young
sleeper
while
grayson
cowering
like
a
frightened
child
left
the
room
beulah
fell
on
her
knees
and
crossing
her
arms
on
the
table
bowed
her
head
now
and
then
broken
wailing
tones
passed
the
white
lips
hartwell
stood
in
a
recess
of
the
window
with
folded
arms
and
tightly
compressed
mouth
watching
the
young
mourner
once
he
moved
toward
her
then
drew
back
and
a
derisive
smile
distorted
his
features
as
though
he
scorned
himself
for
the
momentary
weakness
he
turned
suddenly
away
and
reached
the
door
but
paused
to
look
back
the
old
straw
bonnet
with
its
faded
pink
ribbon
had
fallen
off
and
heavy
folds
of
black
hair
veiled
the
bowed
face
he
noted
the
slight
quivering
form
and
the
thin
hands
and
a
look
of
remorseful
agony
swept
over
his
countenance
a
deadly
pallor
settled
on
cheek
and
brow
as
with
an
expression
of
iron
resolve
he
retraced
his
steps
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
orphan
shoulder
said
gently
beulah
this
is
no
place
for
you
come
with
me
child
she
shrank
from
his
touch
and
put
up
one
hand
waving
him
off
your
sister
died
with
the
scarlet
fever
and
claudia
is
now
very
ill
with
it
if
you
stay
here
you
will
certainly
take
it
yourself
i
hope
i
shall
take
it
he
laid
his
fingers
on
the
pale
high
brow
and
softly
drawing
back
the
thick
hair
said
earnestly
beulah
come
home
with
me
be
my
child
my
daughter
again
her
hand
was
raised
to
put
him
aside
no
you
too
would
hate
me
for
my
ugliness
let
me
hide
it
in
the
grave
with
lilly
they
can
not
separate
us
there
he
lifted
her
head
and
looking
down
into
the
haggard
face
answered
kindly
i
promise
you
i
will
not
think
you
ugly
i
will
make
you
happy
come
to
me
child
she
shook
her
head
with
a
moan
passing
his
arm
around
her
he
raised
her
from
the
carpet
and
leaned
her
head
against
him
poor
little
sufferer
they
have
made
you
drink
prematurely
earth
bitter
draughts
they
have
disenchanted
your
childhood
of
its
future
beulah
you
are
ill
now
do
not
struggle
so
you
must
come
with
me
my
child
he
took
her
in
his
strong
arms
and
bore
her
out
of
the
house
of
death
his
buggy
stood
at
the
door
and
seating
himself
in
it
he
directed
the
boy
who
accompanied
him
to
drive
home
beulah
offered
no
resistance
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
and
sat
quite
still
scarcely
conscious
of
what
passed
she
knew
that
a
firm
arm
held
her
securely
and
save
her
wretchedness
knew
nothing
else
soon
she
was
lifted
out
of
the
buggy
carried
up
a
flight
of
steps
and
then
a
flood
of
light
flashed
through
the
fingers
upon
her
closed
eyelids
hartwell
placed
his
change
on
a
sofa
and
rank
the
bell
the
summons
was
promptly
answered
by
a
negro
woman
of
middle
age
she
stood
at
the
door
awaiting
the
order
but
his
eyes
were
bent
on
the
floor
and
his
brows
knitted
master
did
you
ring
yes
tell
my
sister
to
come
to
me
he
took
a
turn
across
the
floor
and
paused
by
the
open
window
as
the
night
air
rustled
the
brown
locks
on
his
temples
he
sighed
deeply
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
slender
woman
of
perhaps
years
entered
the
room
she
was
pale
and
handsome
with
a
profusion
of
short
chestnut
curls
about
her
face
with
her
hand
resting
on
the
door
she
said
in
a
calm
clear
tone
well
guy
he
started
and
turning
from
the
window
approached
her
may
i
want
a
room
arranged
for
this
child
as
soon
as
possible
will
you
see
that
a
hot
footbath
is
provided
when
it
is
ready
send
harriet
for
her
his
sister
lips
curled
as
she
looked
searchingly
at
the
figure
on
the
sofa
and
said
coldly
what
freak
now
guy
for
a
moment
their
eyes
met
steadily
and
he
smiled
grimly
i
intend
to
adopt
that
poor
little
orphan
that
is
all
where
did
you
pick
her
up
at
the
hospital
said
she
sneeringly
no
she
has
been
hired
as
a
nurse
at
a
boarding
house
he
folded
his
arms
and
again
they
looked
at
each
other
i
thought
you
had
had
quite
enough
of
protegees
she
nervously
clasped
and
unclasped
her
jet
bracelet
take
care
may
ohilton
mark
me
lift
the
pall
from
the
past
once
more
and
you
and
pauline
must
find
another
home
another
protector
now
will
you
see
that
a
room
is
prepared
as
i
directed
he
was
very
pale
and
his
eyes
burned
fiercely
yet
his
tone
was
calm
and
subdued
chilton
bit
her
lips
and
withdrew
hartwell
walked
up
and
down
the
room
for
a
while
now
and
then
looking
sadly
at
the
young
stranger
she
sat
just
as
he
had
placed
her
with
her
hands
over
her
face
kindly
he
bent
down
and
whispered
will
you
trust
me
beulah
she
made
no
answer
but
he
saw
her
brow
wrinkle
and
knew
that
she
shuddered
the
servant
came
in
to
say
that
the
room
had
been
arranged
as
he
had
directed
however
surprised
she
might
have
been
at
this
sudden
advent
of
the
simply
clad
orphan
in
her
study
there
was
not
the
faintest
indication
of
it
in
her
impenetrable
countenance
not
even
the
raising
of
an
eyebrow
harriet
see
that
her
feet
are
well
bathed
and
when
she
is
in
bed
come
for
some
medicine
then
drawing
the
hands
from
her
eyes
he
said
to
beulah
go
with
her
my
child
i
am
glad
i
have
you
safe
under
my
own
roof
where
no
more
cruel
injustice
can
assail
you
he
pressed
her
hand
kindly
and
rising
mechanically
beulah
accompanied
harriet
who
considerately
supported
the
drooping
form
the
room
to
which
she
was
conducted
was
richly
furnished
and
lighted
by
an
elegant
colored
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
chilton
stood
near
an
armchair
looking
moody
and
abstracted
harriet
carefully
undressed
the
poor
mourner
and
wrapping
a
shawl
about
her
placed
her
in
the
chair
and
bathed
her
feet
chilton
watched
her
with
impatience
when
the
little
dripping
feet
were
dried
harriet
lifted
her
as
if
she
had
been
an
infant
and
placed
her
in
bed
then
brought
the
medicine
from
the
study
and
administered
a
spoonful
of
the
mixture
placing
her
finger
on
the
girl
wrist
she
counted
the
rapid
pulse
and
turning
unconcernedly
toward
chilton
said
miss
may
master
says
you
need
not
trouble
about
the
medicine
i
am
to
sleep
in
the
room
and
take
care
of
this
little
girl
very
well
see
that
she
is
properly
attended
to
as
my
brother
directed
my
head
aches
miserably
or
i
should
remain
myself
she
glanced
at
the
bed
and
left
the
room
harriet
leaned
over
the
pillow
and
examined
the
orphan
countenance
the
eyes
were
closed
but
scalding
tears
rolled
swiftly
over
the
cheeks
and
the
hands
were
clasped
over
the
brow
as
if
to
still
its
throbbings
face
softened
and
she
said
kindly
poor
thing
what
ails
you
what
makes
you
cry
so
beulah
pressed
her
head
closer
to
the
pillow
and
murmured
i
am
so
miserable
i
want
to
die
and
god
will
not
take
me
do
say
that
till
you
see
whether
you
got
the
scarlet
fever
if
you
have
you
are
likely
to
be
taken
pretty
soon
i
can
tell
you
and
if
you
have
why
it
all
for
the
best
it
is
a
bad
plan
to
fly
in
the
almighty
face
that
way
and
tell
him
what
he
shall
do
and
what
he
sha
this
philosophic
response
fell
unheeded
on
poor
beulah
ears
and
harriet
was
about
to
inquire
more
minutely
into
the
cause
of
her
grief
but
she
perceived
her
master
standing
beside
her
and
immediately
moved
away
from
the
bed
drawing
out
his
watch
he
counted
the
pulse
several
times
the
result
seemed
to
trouble
him
and
he
stood
for
some
minutes
watching
the
motionless
form
harriet
bring
me
a
glass
of
laying
his
cool
hand
on
the
hot
forehead
of
the
suffering
girl
he
said
tenderly
my
child
try
not
to
cry
any
more
it
is
very
bitter
i
know
but
remember
that
though
lilly
has
been
taken
from
you
from
this
day
you
have
a
friend
a
home
a
guardian
harriet
proffered
the
glass
of
water
he
took
it
raised
the
head
and
put
the
sparkling
draught
to
beulah
parched
lips
without
unclosing
her
eyes
she
drank
the
last
crystal
drop
and
laying
the
head
back
on
the
pillow
he
drew
an
armchair
before
the
window
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
and
seated
himself
chapter
vii
through
quiet
woody
dells
roamed
beulah
spirit
and
hand
in
hand
she
and
lilly
trod
flowery
paths
and
rested
beside
clear
laughing
brooks
life
with
its
grim
realities
seemed
but
a
flying
mist
the
orphan
hovered
on
the
confines
of
eternity
ocean
and
its
silent
waves
almost
laved
the
feet
of
the
weary
child
the
room
was
darkened
and
the
summer
wind
stole
through
the
blinds
stealthily
as
if
awed
by
the
solitude
of
the
hartwell
sat
by
the
low
french
bedstead
holding
one
emaciated
hand
in
his
counting
the
pulse
which
bounded
so
fiercely
in
the
blue
veins
a
fold
of
white
linen
containing
crushed
ice
lay
on
her
forehead
and
the
hollow
cheeks
and
thin
lips
were
flushed
to
vermilion
hue
it
was
not
scarlet
but
brain
fever
and
this
was
the
fifth
day
that
the
sleeper
had
lain
in
a
heavy
stupor
hartwell
put
back
the
hand
he
held
and
stooping
over
looked
long
and
anxiously
at
the
flushed
face
the
breathing
was
deep
and
labored
and
turning
away
he
slowly
and
noiselessly
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
to
have
looked
at
him
then
in
his
purple
silk
robe
de
chambre
one
would
have
scarcely
believed
that
thirty
years
had
passed
over
his
head
he
was
tall
and
his
head
massive
and
well
formed
his
face
a
curious
study
the
brow
was
expansive
and
almost
transparent
in
its
purity
the
dark
hazel
eyes
were
singularly
brilliant
while
the
contour
of
lips
and
chin
was
partially
concealed
by
a
heavy
mustache
and
board
the
first
glance
at
his
face
impressed
strangers
by
its
extreme
pallor
but
in
a
second
look
they
were
fascinated
by
the
misty
splendor
of
the
eyes
in
truth
those
were
strange
eyes
of
guy
hartwell
at
times
searching
and
glittering
like
polished
steel
occasionally
lighting
up
with
a
dazzling
radiance
and
then
as
suddenly
growing
gentle
hazy
yet
luminous
resembling
the
clouded
aspect
of
a
star
seen
through
a
thin
veil
of
mist
his
brown
curling
hair
was
thrown
back
from
the
face
and
exposed
the
outline
of
the
ample
forehead
perhaps
utilitarians
would
have
carped
at
the
feminine
delicacy
of
the
hands
and
certainly
the
fingers
were
slender
and
marvelously
white
on
one
hand
he
wore
an
antique
ring
composed
of
a
cameo
set
round
with
diamonds
a
proud
gifted
and
miserable
man
was
guy
hartwell
and
his
characteristic
expression
of
stern
sadness
might
easily
have
been
mistaken
by
casual
observers
for
bitter
misanthropy
i
have
said
he
was
about
thirty
and
though
the
handsome
face
was
repellently
cold
and
grave
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
that
smooth
fair
brow
had
been
for
so
many
years
uplifted
for
the
handwriting
of
time
he
looked
just
what
he
was
a
baffling
fascinating
mystery
you
felt
that
his
countenance
was
a
volume
of
hieroglyphics
which
could
you
decipher
would
unfold
the
history
of
a
checkered
and
painful
career
yet
the
calm
frigid
smile
which
sat
on
his
lip
and
looked
out
defiantly
from
his
eyes
seemed
to
dare
you
to
an
investigation
mere
physical
beauty
can
not
impart
the
indescribable
charm
which
his
countenance
possessed
regularity
of
features
is
a
valuable
auxiliary
but
we
look
on
sculptured
marble
perfect
in
its
chiseled
proportions
and
feel
that
after
all
the
potent
spell
is
in
the
raying
out
of
the
soul
that
imprisoned
radiance
which
in
some
instances
makes
man
indeed
but
little
lower
than
the
angels
he
paused
in
his
echoless
tread
and
sat
down
once
more
beside
his
protegee
she
had
not
changed
her
position
and
the
long
lashes
lay
heavily
on
the
crimson
cheeks
the
parched
lips
were
parted
and
as
he
watched
her
she
murmured
aloud
it
is
so
sweet
lilly
we
will
stay
here
always
a
shadowy
smile
crossed
her
face
and
then
a
great
agony
seemed
to
possess
her
for
she
moaned
long
and
bitterly
he
tried
to
arouse
her
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
night
she
entered
his
house
she
opened
her
eyes
and
gazed
vacantly
at
him
are
you
in
pain
beulah
why
do
you
moan
so
eugene
i
knew
it
would
be
so
when
you
left
me
do
you
know
me
beulah
he
put
his
face
close
to
hers
they
killed
her
eugene
i
told
you
they
would
they
are
going
to
bury
her
soon
but
the
grave
ca
hide
her
i
am
going
down
with
her
into
the
darkness
she
would
be
frightened
you
know
making
a
great
effort
she
sat
upright
hartwell
put
a
glass
containing
medicine
to
her
lips
she
shrank
back
and
shuddered
then
raised
her
hand
for
the
glass
and
looking
fixedly
at
him
said
did
grayson
say
i
must
take
it
is
it
poison
that
kills
quickly
there
do
frown
eugene
i
will
drink
it
all
for
you
she
swallowed
the
draught
with
a
shiver
he
laid
her
back
on
her
pillow
and
renewed
the
on
her
forehead
she
did
not
move
her
burning
eyes
from
his
face
and
the
refreshing
coolness
recalled
the
sad
smile
are
we
on
the
alps
eugene
i
feel
dizzy
do
let
me
fall
there
is
a
great
chasm
yonder
oh
i
know
now
i
am
not
afraid
lilly
is
down
there
come
on
her
arms
drooped
to
her
side
and
she
slept
again
evening
shadows
crept
on
soon
the
room
was
dark
harriet
entered
with
a
shaded
lamp
but
her
master
motioned
her
out
and
throwing
open
the
blinds
suffered
the
pure
moonlight
to
enter
freely
the
window
looked
out
on
the
flower
garden
and
the
mingled
fragrance
of
roses
jasmines
honeysuckles
and
enveloped
him
as
in
a
cloud
of
incense
a
balmy
moonlight
june
night
in
our
beautiful
sunny
south
who
shall
adequately
paint
its
witchery
hartwell
leaned
his
head
against
the
window
and
glanced
down
at
the
parterre
he
had
so
fondly
fostered
the
golden
moonlight
mellowed
every
object
and
not
the
gorgeous
pictures
of
persian
poets
surpassed
the
quiet
scene
that
greeted
the
master
the
shelled
serpentine
walks
were
bordered
with
low
closely
clipped
cassina
hedges
clusters
of
white
and
rose
oleander
scarlet
geraniums
roses
of
countless
variety
beds
of
verbena
of
every
hue
and
patches
of
brilliant
annuals
all
looked
up
smilingly
at
him
just
beneath
the
window
the
clasping
tendrils
of
a
clematis
were
wound
about
the
pedestal
of
a
marble
flora
and
a
cluster
of
the
delicate
purple
blossoms
peeped
through
the
fingers
of
the
goddess
further
off
a
fountain
flashed
in
the
moonlight
murmuring
musically
in
and
out
of
its
reservoir
while
the
diamond
spray
bathed
the
sculptured
limbs
of
a
venus
the
sea
breeze
sang
its
lullaby
through
the
boughs
of
a
luxuriant
orange
tree
near
and
silence
seemed
guardian
spirit
of
the
beautiful
spot
when
a
whirred
through
the
air
and
perching
on
the
snowy
brow
of
the
aphrodite
began
his
plaintive
in
childhood
guy
hartwell
had
been
taught
by
his
nurse
to
regard
the
melancholy
chant
as
ominous
of
evil
but
as
years
threw
their
shadows
over
his
heart
darkening
the
hopes
of
his
boyhood
the
sad
notes
of
the
lonely
bird
became
gradually
soothing
and
now
in
the
prime
of
life
he
loved
to
listen
to
the
shy
visitor
and
ceased
to
remember
that
it
boded
with
an
ardent
love
for
the
beautiful
in
all
its
protean
phases
he
enjoyed
communion
with
nature
as
only
an
imaginative
aesthetical
temperament
can
this
keen
appreciation
of
beauty
had
been
fostered
by
travel
and
study
over
the
vast
studio
of
nature
he
had
eagerly
roamed
midnight
had
seen
him
gazing
enraptured
on
the
loveliness
of
italian
scenery
and
found
him
watching
the
march
of
constellations
from
the
lonely
heights
of
the
hartz
while
the
thunder
tones
of
awful
niagara
had
often
hushed
the
tumults
of
his
passionate
heart
and
bowed
his
proud
head
in
humble
adoration
he
had
searched
the
storehouses
of
art
and
collected
treasures
that
kindled
divine
aspirations
in
his
soul
and
wooed
him
for
a
time
from
the
cemetery
of
memory
with
a
nature
so
intensely
aesthetical
and
taste
so
thoroughly
cultivated
he
had
in
a
great
measure
assimilated
his
home
to
the
artistic
beau
ideal
now
as
he
stood
inhaling
the
perfumed
air
he
forgot
the
little
sufferer
a
few
yards
off
forgot
that
azrail
stood
on
the
threshold
beckoning
her
to
brave
the
dark
floods
and
as
his
whole
nature
became
permeated
so
to
speak
by
the
intoxicating
beauty
that
surrounded
him
he
extended
his
arms
and
exclaimed
triumphantly
truly
thou
art
my
mother
dear
old
earth
i
feel
that
i
am
indeed
nearly
allied
to
thy
divine
beauty
starry
nights
and
whispering
winds
and
fragrant
flowers
yea
and
even
the
breath
of
the
tempest
all
all
are
parts
of
my
being
guy
there
is
a
messenger
waiting
at
the
door
to
see
you
some
patient
requires
prompt
attendance
chilton
stood
near
the
window
and
the
moonlight
flashed
over
her
handsome
face
her
brother
frowned
and
motioned
her
away
but
smiling
quietly
she
put
her
beautifully
molded
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
said
i
am
sorry
i
disturbed
your
meditations
but
if
you
will
practice
who
sent
for
me
i
really
do
know
will
you
be
good
enough
to
inquire
certainly
she
glided
gracefully
from
the
room
the
flew
from
his
marble
perch
and
as
the
mournful
tones
died
away
the
master
sighed
and
returned
to
the
bedside
of
his
charge
he
renewed
the
ice
on
her
brow
and
soon
after
his
sister
vincent
is
very
sick
and
you
are
wanted
immediately
very
well
he
crossed
the
room
and
rang
the
bell
guy
are
you
sure
that
girl
has
not
scarlet
fever
may
i
have
answered
that
question
at
least
twice
a
day
for
nearly
a
week
but
you
should
sympathize
with
a
mother
anxiety
i
dread
to
expose
pauline
to
danger
then
let
her
remain
where
she
is
but
i
prefer
having
her
come
home
if
i
could
feel
assured
that
girl
has
only
brain
fever
then
once
for
all
there
is
no
scarlet
fever
in
the
house
he
took
a
vial
from
his
pocket
and
poured
a
portion
of
its
contents
into
the
glass
which
he
placed
on
a
stand
by
beulah
bed
then
turning
to
harriet
who
had
obeyed
his
summons
he
directed
her
to
administer
the
medicine
hourly
guy
you
may
give
your
directions
to
me
for
i
shall
stay
with
the
child
as
she
spoke
she
seated
herself
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
harriet
hand
me
the
candle
in
the
hall
she
did
so
and
as
her
master
took
it
from
her
hand
he
said
abruptly
tell
hal
to
bring
my
buggy
round
and
then
you
may
go
to
bed
i
will
ring
if
you
are
wanted
he
waited
until
she
was
out
of
hearing
and
walking
up
to
his
sister
held
the
candle
so
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
her
face
may
can
i
trust
you
brother
you
are
cruelly
unjust
she
covered
her
face
with
her
lace
handkerchief
am
i
indeed
yes
you
wrong
me
hourly
with
miserable
suspicions
guy
remember
that
i
have
your
blood
in
my
veins
and
it
will
not
always
tamely
bear
insult
even
from
you
she
removed
the
handkerchief
and
shook
back
her
glossy
curls
while
her
face
grew
still
paler
than
was
its
wont
insult
may
can
the
unvarnished
truth
be
such
they
eyed
each
other
steadily
and
it
was
apparent
that
each
iron
will
was
mated
guy
you
shall
repent
this
perhaps
so
you
have
made
me
repent
many
things
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
mean
to
say
that
since
you
have
at
last
offered
to
assist
in
nursing
that
unconscious
child
i
wish
you
to
give
the
medicine
hourly
the
last
potion
was
at
eight
he
placed
the
candle
so
as
to
shade
the
light
from
the
sick
girl
and
left
the
room
chilton
sat
for
some
time
as
he
had
left
her
with
her
head
leaning
on
her
hand
her
thoughts
evidently
perplexed
and
bitter
at
length
she
rose
and
stood
close
to
beulah
looking
earnestly
at
her
emaciated
face
she
put
her
fingers
on
the
burning
temples
and
wrist
and
counted
accurately
the
pulsations
of
the
lava
tide
then
bent
her
queenly
head
and
listened
to
the
heavily
drawn
breathing
a
haughty
smile
lit
her
fine
features
as
she
said
complacently
a
mere
tempest
in
a
teacup
pshaw
this
girl
will
not
mar
my
projects
long
by
noon
tomorrow
she
will
be
in
eternity
i
thought
the
first
time
i
saw
her
ghostly
face
she
would
trouble
me
but
a
short
season
what
paradoxes
men
are
what
on
earth
possessed
guy
with
his
fastidious
taste
to
bring
to
his
home
such
an
ugly
wasted
sallow
little
wretch
i
verily
believe
as
a
family
we
are
beset
by
evil
angels
drawing
out
her
watch
she
saw
that
the
hand
had
passed
nine
raising
the
glass
to
her
lips
she
drank
the
quantity
prescribed
for
the
sufferer
and
was
replacing
it
on
the
stand
when
beulah
large
eloquent
eyes
startled
her
well
child
what
do
you
want
said
she
trembling
despite
her
assumed
indifference
beulah
looked
at
her
vacantly
then
threw
her
arms
restlessly
over
the
pillow
and
slept
again
chilton
drew
up
a
chair
seated
herself
and
sank
into
a
reverie
of
some
length
ultimately
she
was
aroused
by
perceiving
her
brother
beside
her
and
said
hastily
how
is
vincent
not
dangerously
ill
i
hope
tomorrow
will
decide
that
it
is
now
ten
minutes
past
ten
how
many
potions
have
you
given
two
answered
she
firmly
thank
you
may
i
will
relieve
you
now
but
you
are
worn
out
and
i
am
not
let
me
sit
up
i
will
wake
you
if
any
change
occurs
thank
you
i
prefer
watching
tonight
take
that
candle
and
leave
it
on
the
table
in
the
hall
i
need
nothing
but
moonlight
leave
the
door
open
as
the
flickering
light
vanished
he
threw
himself
into
the
chair
beside
the
bed
chapter
viii
it
was
in
the
gray
light
of
dawning
day
that
beulah
awoke
to
consciousness
for
some
moments
after
unclosing
her
eyes
they
wandered
inquiringly
about
the
room
and
finally
rested
on
the
tall
form
of
the
watcher
as
he
stood
at
the
open
window
gradually
memory
gathered
up
its
scattered
links
and
all
the
incidents
of
that
hour
of
anguish
rushed
vividly
before
her
the
little
table
with
its
marble
sleeper
then
a
dim
recollection
of
having
been
carried
to
a
friendly
shelter
was
it
only
yesterday
evening
and
had
she
slept
the
utter
prostration
which
prevented
her
raising
her
head
and
the
emaciated
appearance
of
her
hands
told
her
no
too
feeble
even
to
think
she
moaned
audibly
hartwell
turned
and
looked
at
her
the
room
was
still
in
shadow
though
the
eastern
sky
was
flushed
and
he
stepped
to
the
bedside
the
fever
had
died
out
the
cheeks
were
very
pale
and
the
unnaturally
large
sunken
eyes
lusterless
she
looked
at
him
steadily
yet
with
perfect
indifference
he
leaned
over
and
said
eagerly
beulah
do
you
know
me
yes
i
know
you
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
i
am
very
weak
and
my
head
seems
confused
how
long
have
i
been
here
no
matter
child
if
you
are
better
he
took
out
his
watch
and
after
counting
her
pulse
prepared
some
medicine
and
gave
her
a
potion
her
features
twitched
and
she
asked
tremblingly
as
if
afraid
of
her
own
question
have
they
buried
her
yes
a
week
ago
she
closed
her
eyes
with
a
groan
and
her
face
became
convulsed
then
she
lay
quite
still
with
a
wrinkled
brow
hartwell
sat
down
by
her
and
taking
one
of
her
wasted
little
hands
in
his
said
gently
beulah
you
have
been
very
ill
i
scarcely
thought
you
would
recover
and
now
though
much
better
you
must
not
agitate
yourself
for
you
are
far
too
weak
to
bear
it
why
did
you
let
me
die
oh
it
would
have
been
a
mercy
she
put
her
hand
over
her
eyes
and
a
low
cry
wailed
through
the
room
because
i
wanted
you
to
get
well
and
live
here
and
be
my
little
friend
my
child
now
beulah
i
have
saved
you
and
you
belong
to
me
when
you
are
stronger
we
will
talk
about
all
you
want
to
know
but
you
must
keep
quiet
and
not
think
of
what
distresses
you
will
you
try
the
strong
stern
man
shuddered
as
she
looked
up
at
him
with
an
expression
of
hopeless
desolation
and
said
slowly
i
have
nothing
but
misery
to
think
of
have
you
forgotten
eugene
so
soon
for
an
instant
the
eyes
lighted
up
then
the
long
lashes
swept
her
cheeks
and
she
murmured
eugene
he
has
left
me
too
something
will
happen
to
him
also
i
never
loved
anything
but
trouble
came
upon
it
hartwell
smiled
grimly
as
though
unconsciously
she
had
turned
to
view
some
page
in
the
history
of
his
own
life
beulah
you
must
not
despond
eugene
will
come
back
an
elegant
young
man
before
you
are
fairly
out
of
short
dresses
there
do
not
talk
any
more
and
do
cry
try
to
sleep
and
remember
child
you
are
homeless
and
friendless
no
longer
he
pressed
her
hand
kindly
and
turned
toward
the
door
it
opened
and
chilton
entered
guy
how
is
your
patient
said
she
blandly
may
my
little
patient
is
much
better
she
has
been
talking
to
me
and
i
am
going
to
send
her
some
breakfast
he
put
both
hands
on
his
sister
shoulders
and
looked
down
into
her
beautiful
eyes
she
did
not
flinch
but
he
saw
a
grayish
hue
settle
around
her
lips
ah
i
thought
last
night
there
was
little
hope
of
her
recovery
you
are
a
wonderful
doctor
guy
almost
equal
to
raising
the
dead
her
voice
was
even
and
like
his
own
marvelously
sweet
more
wonderful
still
may
i
can
read
the
living
his
mustached
lip
curled
as
a
scornful
smile
passed
over
his
face
read
the
living
then
you
can
understand
and
appreciate
my
pleasure
at
this
good
news
doubly
good
because
it
secures
pauline
return
dear
child
i
long
to
have
her
at
home
again
an
expression
of
anxious
maternal
solicitude
crossed
her
features
her
brother
kept
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
as
his
eye
fell
on
her
glossy
auburn
curls
he
said
half
musingly
time
touches
you
daintily
may
there
is
not
one
silver
footprint
on
your
hair
he
has
dealt
quite
as
leniently
with
you
but
how
could
i
feel
the
inroads
of
time
shielded
as
i
have
been
by
your
kindness
cares
and
sorrows
bleach
the
locks
oftener
than
accumulated
years
and
you
guy
have
most
kindly
guarded
your
poor
widowed
sister
have
i
indeed
may
ah
what
would
become
of
my
pauline
and
me
but
for
your
generosity
your
enough
then
once
for
all
be
kind
to
yonder
sick
child
if
not
for
her
sake
for
your
own
you
and
pauline
can
aid
me
in
making
her
happy
if
you
will
and
if
not
remember
may
you
know
my
nature
do
not
disturb
beulah
now
come
down
and
let
her
be
quiet
he
led
her
down
the
steps
and
then
throwing
open
a
glass
door
stepped
out
upon
a
terrace
covered
with
bermuda
grass
and
sparkling
like
a
tiara
in
the
early
sunlight
chilton
watched
him
descend
the
two
white
marble
steps
leading
down
to
the
flower
beds
and
leaning
against
the
wall
she
muttered
it
can
not
be
possible
that
that
miserable
beggar
is
to
come
between
pauline
and
his
property
is
he
mad
to
dream
of
making
that
little
outcast
his
heiress
yet
he
meant
it
i
saw
it
in
his
eye
the
lurking
devil
that
has
slumbered
since
that
evening
and
that
i
hoped
would
never
gleam
out
at
me
again
oh
we
are
a
precious
family
set
the
will
of
one
against
another
and
all
pandemonium
ca
crush
either
ten
to
one
pauline
will
lose
her
wits
too
and
be
as
hard
to
manage
as
guy
moody
and
perplexed
she
walked
on
to
the
dining
room
beulah
had
fallen
into
a
heavy
slumber
of
exhaustion
and
it
was
late
in
the
day
when
she
again
unclosed
her
eyes
harriet
sat
sewing
near
her
but
soon
perceived
that
she
was
awake
and
immediately
put
aside
her
work
aha
so
you
have
come
to
your
senses
again
have
you
how
are
you
child
i
am
weak
which
is
strange
seeing
that
you
have
eat
a
teaspoonful
in
more
than
a
week
now
look
here
little
one
i
am
ordered
to
nurse
and
take
charge
of
you
till
you
are
strong
enough
to
look
out
for
yourself
so
you
must
not
object
to
anything
i
tell
you
to
do
without
further
parley
she
washed
and
wiped
beulah
face
and
hands
shook
up
the
pillows
and
placed
her
comfortably
on
them
to
the
orphan
accustomed
all
her
life
to
wait
upon
others
there
was
something
singularly
novel
in
being
thus
carefully
handled
and
nestling
her
head
close
to
the
pillows
she
shut
her
eyes
lest
the
tears
that
were
gathering
should
become
visible
harriet
quitted
the
room
for
a
short
time
and
returned
with
a
salver
containing
some
refreshments
i
ca
eat
anything
thank
you
but
take
it
away
beulah
put
her
hands
over
her
face
but
harriet
resolutely
seated
herself
on
the
side
of
the
bed
lifted
her
up
and
put
a
cup
of
tea
to
the
quivering
lips
it
is
no
use
talking
master
said
you
had
to
eat
and
you
might
just
as
well
do
it
at
once
poor
thing
you
are
hiding
your
eyes
to
cry
well
drink
this
tea
and
eat
a
little
you
must
for
folks
ca
live
forever
without
eating
there
was
no
alternative
and
beulah
swallowed
what
was
given
her
harriet
praised
her
obedient
spirit
and
busied
herself
about
the
room
for
some
time
finally
stooping
over
the
bed
she
said
abruptly
honey
are
you
crying
there
was
no
reply
and
kneeling
down
she
said
cautiously
if
you
knew
as
much
about
this
family
as
i
do
you
would
cry
sure
enough
for
something
my
master
says
he
has
adopted
you
and
since
he
has
said
it
everything
will
work
for
good
to
you
but
child
there
will
come
times
when
you
need
a
friend
besides
master
and
be
sure
you
come
to
me
when
you
do
i
wo
say
any
more
now
but
remember
what
i
tell
you
when
you
get
into
trouble
miss
pauline
has
come
and
if
she
happens
to
take
a
fancy
to
you
which
i
think
she
wo
she
will
stand
by
you
till
the
stars
fall
and
if
she
do
she
will
hate
you
worse
than
satan
himself
for
harriet
did
not
complete
the
sentence
for
she
detected
her
master
step
in
the
passage
and
resumed
her
work
how
is
she
she
did
not
eat
much
sir
and
seems
so
downhearted
that
will
do
i
will
ring
when
you
are
needed
hartwell
seated
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
lifting
the
child
head
to
his
bosom
drew
away
the
hands
that
shaded
her
face
beulah
are
you
following
my
directions
oh
sir
you
are
very
kind
but
i
am
too
wretched
too
miserable
even
to
thank
you
i
do
not
wish
you
to
thank
me
all
i
desire
is
that
you
will
keep
quiet
for
a
few
days
till
you
grow
strong
and
not
lie
here
sobbing
yourself
into
another
fever
i
know
you
have
had
a
bitter
lot
in
life
so
far
and
memories
are
all
painful
with
you
but
it
is
better
not
to
dwell
upon
the
past
ah
child
it
is
well
to
live
only
in
the
present
looking
into
the
future
i
promise
you
i
will
guard
you
and
care
for
you
as
tenderly
as
a
father
and
now
beulah
i
think
you
owe
it
to
me
to
try
to
be
cheerful
he
passed
his
fingers
softly
over
her
forehead
and
put
back
the
tangled
masses
of
jetty
hair
which
long
neglect
had
piled
about
her
face
the
touch
of
his
cool
hand
the
low
musical
tones
of
his
voice
were
very
soothing
to
the
weary
sufferer
and
with
a
great
effort
she
looked
up
into
the
deep
dark
eyes
saying
brokenly
oh
sir
how
good
you
are
i
am
very
grateful
to
you
indeed
i
there
my
child
do
not
try
to
talk
only
trust
me
and
be
cheerful
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
have
you
here
and
know
that
you
will
always
remain
in
my
house
how
long
he
sat
there
she
never
knew
for
soon
she
slept
and
when
hours
after
she
waked
the
lamp
was
burning
dimly
and
only
harriet
was
in
the
room
a
week
passed
and
the
girl
saw
no
one
except
the
nurse
and
physician
one
sunny
afternoon
she
looped
back
the
white
curtains
and
sat
down
before
the
open
window
harriet
had
dressed
her
in
a
blue
calico
wrapper
which
made
her
wan
face
still
more
ghastly
and
the
folds
of
black
hair
which
the
gentle
fingers
of
the
kind
nurse
had
disentangled
lay
thick
about
her
forehead
like
an
ebon
wreath
on
the
brow
of
a
statue
her
elbows
rested
on
the
arms
of
the
and
the
weary
head
leaned
upon
the
hands
before
her
lay
the
flower
garden
brilliant
and
fragrant
further
on
a
row
of
lombardy
poplars
bounded
the
yard
and
beyond
the
street
stretched
the
west
common
in
the
distance
rose
a
venerable
brick
building
set
as
it
were
in
an
emerald
lawn
and
beulah
looked
only
once
and
knew
it
vas
the
asylum
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
it
since
her
exodus
and
the
fountain
could
no
longer
be
restrained
great
hot
tears
fell
over
the
bent
face
and
the
frail
form
trembled
violently
for
nearly
fourteen
years
that
brave
spirit
had
battled
and
borne
and
tried
to
hope
for
better
things
with
more
than
ordinary
fortitude
she
had
resigned
herself
to
the
sorrows
that
came
thick
and
fast
upon
her
and
trusting
in
the
eternal
love
and
goodness
of
god
had
looked
to
him
for
relief
and
reward
but
the
reward
came
not
in
the
expected
way
hope
died
faith
fainted
and
bitterness
and
despair
reigned
in
that
once
loving
and
gentle
soul
her
father
had
not
been
spared
in
answer
to
her
frantic
prayers
lilly
had
been
taken
without
even
the
sad
comfort
of
a
farewell
and
now
with
the
present
full
of
anguish
and
the
future
shrouded
in
dark
forebodings
she
sobbed
aloud
all
alone
all
alone
oh
father
oh
lilly
lilly
do
pray
chile
do
take
on
so
you
will
fret
yourself
sick
again
said
harriet
compassionately
patting
the
drooped
head
do
talk
to
me
do
speak
to
me
cried
beulah
passionately
yes
but
i
was
told
not
to
let
you
grieve
yourself
to
death
and
you
are
doing
your
best
why
do
you
put
your
trust
in
the
lord
i
did
and
he
has
forgotten
me
no
chile
he
forgets
not
even
the
little
i
expect
you
wanted
to
lay
down
the
law
for
him
and
are
not
willing
to
wait
until
he
sees
fit
to
bless
you
is
it
so
he
never
can
give
me
back
my
dead
but
he
can
raise
up
other
friends
for
you
and
he
has
it
is
a
blessed
thing
to
have
my
master
for
a
friend
and
a
protector
think
of
living
always
in
a
place
like
this
with
plenty
of
money
and
nothing
to
wish
for
chile
you
do
know
how
lucky
she
paused
startled
by
ringing
peals
of
laughter
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
adjoining
passage
sounds
of
mirth
fell
torturingly
upon
beulah
bleeding
spirit
and
she
pressed
her
fingers
tightly
over
her
ears
just
opposite
to
her
sat
the
old
trunk
which
a
fortnight
before
she
had
packed
for
her
journey
up
the
river
the
leathern
face
seemed
to
sympathize
with
her
woe
and
kneeling
down
on
the
floor
she
wound
her
arms
caressingly
over
it
bless
the
girl
she
hugs
that
ugly
thing
as
if
it
were
kin
to
her
said
harriet
who
sat
sewing
at
one
of
the
windows
beulah
raised
the
lid
and
there
lay
her
clothes
the
books
eugene
had
given
her
two
or
three
faded
garments
of
lilly
and
an
old
bible
the
tears
froze
in
her
eyes
as
she
took
out
the
last
and
opened
it
at
the
ribbon
mark
these
words
greeted
her
whom
the
lord
loveth
he
chasteneth
again
and
again
she
read
them
and
the
crushed
tendrils
of
trust
feebly
twined
once
more
about
the
promise
as
she
sat
there
wondering
why
suffering
and
sorrow
always
fell
on
those
whom
the
bible
calls
blessed
and
trying
to
explain
the
paradox
the
door
was
thrown
rudely
open
and
a
girl
about
her
own
age
sprang
into
the
room
quickly
followed
by
chilton
let
me
alone
mother
i
tell
you
i
mean
to
see
her
and
then
you
are
welcome
to
me
as
long
as
you
please
ah
is
that
her
the
speaker
paused
in
the
center
of
the
apartment
and
gazed
curiously
at
the
figure
seated
before
the
old
trunk
involuntarily
beulah
raised
her
eyes
and
met
the
searching
look
fixed
upon
her
the
intruder
was
richly
dressed
and
her
very
posture
bespoke
the
lawless
independence
of
a
willful
petted
child
the
figure
was
faultlessly
symmetrical
and
her
face
radiantly
beautiful
the
features
were
clearly
cut
and
regular
the
eyes
of
deep
dark
violet
hue
shaded
by
curling
brown
lashes
her
chestnut
hair
was
thrown
back
with
a
silver
comb
and
fell
in
thick
curls
below
the
waist
her
complexion
was
of
alabaster
clearness
and
cheeks
and
lips
wore
the
coral
bloom
of
health
as
they
confronted
each
other
one
looked
a
hebe
the
other
a
ghostly
visitant
from
spirit
realms
beulah
shrank
from
the
eager
scrutiny
and
put
up
her
hands
to
shield
her
face
the
other
advanced
a
few
steps
and
stood
beside
her
the
expression
of
curiosity
faded
and
something
like
compassion
swept
over
the
stranger
features
as
she
noted
the
thin
drooping
form
of
the
invalid
her
lips
parted
and
she
put
out
her
hand
as
if
to
address
beulah
when
chilton
exclaimed
impatiently
pauline
come
down
this
instant
your
uncle
positively
forbade
your
entering
this
room
until
he
gave
you
permission
there
is
his
buggy
this
minute
come
out
i
say
she
laid
her
hand
in
no
gentle
manner
on
her
daughter
arm
oh
sink
the
buggy
what
do
i
care
if
he
does
catch
me
here
i
shall
stay
till
i
make
up
my
mind
whether
that
little
thing
is
a
ghost
or
not
so
mother
let
me
alone
she
shook
off
the
clasping
hand
that
sought
to
drag
her
away
and
again
fixed
her
attention
on
beulah
willful
girl
you
will
ruin
everything
yet
pauline
follow
me
instantly
i
command
you
she
was
white
with
rage
but
the
daughter
gave
no
intimation
of
having
heard
the
words
and
throwing
her
arm
about
the
girl
waist
chilton
dragged
her
to
the
door
there
was
a
brief
struggle
at
the
threshold
and
then
both
stood
quiet
before
the
master
of
the
house
what
is
all
this
confusion
about
i
ordered
this
portion
of
the
house
kept
silent
did
i
not
yes
guy
and
i
hope
you
will
forgive
pauline
thoughtlessness
she
blundered
in
here
and
i
have
just
been
scolding
her
for
disobeying
your
injunctions
uncle
guy
it
was
not
thoughtlessness
at
all
i
came
on
purpose
for
a
week
i
have
been
nearly
dying
with
curiosity
to
see
that
little
skeleton
you
have
shut
up
here
and
i
ran
up
to
get
a
glimpse
of
her
i
do
see
the
harm
of
it
i
have
hurt
her
pauline
looked
fearlessly
up
in
her
uncle
face
and
planted
herself
firmly
in
the
door
as
if
resolved
not
to
be
ejected
does
this
house
belong
to
you
or
to
me
pauline
to
you
now
to
me
some
of
these
days
when
you
give
it
to
me
for
a
bridal
present
his
brow
cleared
he
looked
kindly
down
into
the
frank
truthful
countenance
and
said
with
a
do
not
repeat
your
voyage
of
discovery
or
perhaps
your
bridal
anticipations
may
prove
an
egregious
failure
do
you
understand
me
i
have
not
finished
the
first
mother
played
pirate
and
carried
me
off
before
i
was
half
satisfied
uncle
guy
take
me
under
your
flag
do
i
will
not
worry
the
little
thing
i
promise
you
i
will
not
ca
i
stay
here
a
while
he
smiled
and
put
his
hand
on
her
head
saying
i
am
inclined
to
try
you
may
you
can
leave
her
here
i
will
send
her
to
you
after
a
little
as
he
spoke
he
drew
her
up
to
the
orphan
beulah
looked
at
them
an
instant
then
averted
her
head
beulah
this
is
my
niece
pauline
chilton
and
pauline
this
is
my
adopted
child
beulah
benton
you
are
about
the
same
age
and
can
make
each
other
happy
if
you
will
beulah
shake
hands
with
my
niece
she
put
up
her
pale
slender
fingers
and
they
were
promptly
clasped
in
pauline
plump
palm
do
stop
crying
and
look
at
me
i
want
to
see
you
said
the
latter
i
am
not
crying
then
what
are
you
hiding
your
face
for
because
it
is
so
ugly
answered
the
orphan
sadly
pauline
stooped
down
took
the
head
in
her
hands
and
turned
the
features
to
view
she
gave
them
a
searching
examination
and
then
looking
up
at
her
uncle
said
bluntly
she
is
not
pretty
that
is
a
fact
but
somehow
i
rather
like
her
if
she
did
not
look
so
doleful
and
had
some
blood
in
her
lips
she
would
pass
well
enough
do
you
think
so
hartwell
did
not
reply
but
raising
beulah
from
the
floor
placed
her
in
the
chair
she
had
vacated
some
time
before
she
did
indeed
look
doleful
as
pauline
expressed
it
and
the
beaming
lovely
face
of
the
latter
rendered
her
wan
aspect
more
apparent
what
have
you
been
doing
all
day
said
the
doctor
kindly
she
pointed
to
the
asylum
and
answered
in
a
low
subdued
tone
thinking
about
my
past
life
all
my
misfortunes
you
promised
you
would
do
so
no
more
ah
sir
how
can
i
help
it
why
think
of
something
pleasant
of
course
interrupted
pauline
you
never
had
any
sorrows
you
know
nothing
of
suffering
replied
beulah
allowing
her
eyes
to
dwell
on
the
fine
open
countenance
before
her
a
mirthful
sunny
face
where
waves
of
grief
had
never
rippled
how
came
you
so
wise
i
have
troubles
sometimes
just
like
everbody
else
beulah
shook
her
head
dubiously
pauline
will
you
try
to
cheer
this
sad
little
stranger
will
you
be
always
kind
in
your
manner
and
remember
that
her
life
has
not
been
as
happy
as
yours
ca
you
love
her
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
answered
evasively
i
dare
say
we
will
get
on
well
enough
if
she
will
only
quit
looking
so
dismal
and
graveyardish
i
do
know
about
loving
her
we
shall
see
you
can
go
down
to
your
mother
now
said
he
gravely
that
means
you
are
tired
of
me
uncle
guy
cried
she
saucily
shaking
her
curls
over
her
face
yes
heartily
tired
of
you
take
yourself
off
shadow
i
shall
come
to
see
you
again
she
reached
the
door
but
looked
back
uncle
have
you
seen
charon
since
you
came
home
no
well
he
will
die
if
you
do
do
something
for
him
it
is
a
shame
to
forget
him
as
you
do
said
she
indignantly
attend
to
your
own
affairs
and
do
not
interfere
with
mine
it
is
high
time
somebody
interfered
poor
charon
if
hal
take
better
care
of
him
i
will
make
his
mother
box
his
ears
see
if
i
do
she
bounded
down
the
steps
leaving
her
uncle
to
smooth
his
brow
at
leisure
turning
to
beulah
he
took
her
hand
and
said
very
kindly
this
large
room
does
not
suit
you
come
and
i
will
show
you
your
own
little
room
one
i
have
had
arranged
for
you
she
silently
complied
and
leading
her
through
several
passages
he
opened
the
door
of
the
apartment
assigned
her
the
walls
were
covered
with
blue
and
silver
paper
the
window
curtains
of
white
faced
with
blue
matched
it
well
and
every
article
of
furniture
bespoke
lavish
and
tasteful
expenditure
there
was
a
small
near
a
handsome
case
of
books
and
a
little
with
a
drawn
up
to
it
he
seated
beulah
and
stood
watching
her
as
her
eyes
wandered
curiously
and
admiringly
around
the
room
they
rested
on
a
painting
suspended
over
the
desk
and
wrapt
in
contemplating
the
design
she
forgot
for
a
moment
all
her
sorrows
it
represented
an
angelic
figure
winging
its
way
over
a
valley
beclouded
and
dismal
and
pointing
with
a
radiant
countenance
to
the
gilded
summit
of
a
distant
steep
below
bands
of
pilgrims
weary
and
worn
toiled
on
some
fainting
by
the
wayside
some
seated
in
sullen
despair
some
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
some
pressing
forward
with
strained
gaze
and
pale
haggard
faces
do
you
like
it
said
hartwell
perhaps
she
did
not
hear
him
certainly
she
did
not
heed
the
question
and
taking
a
seat
near
one
of
the
windows
he
regarded
her
earnestly
her
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
picture
and
raising
her
hands
toward
it
she
said
in
broken
indistinct
tones
i
am
dying
down
in
the
dark
valley
oh
come
help
me
to
toil
on
to
the
her
head
sank
upon
her
bosom
and
bitter
waves
lashed
her
heart
once
more
gradually
evening
shadows
crept
on
and
at
length
a
soft
hand
lifted
her
face
and
a
musical
voice
said
beulah
i
want
you
to
come
down
to
my
study
and
make
my
tea
do
you
feel
strong
enough
yes
sir
she
rose
at
once
and
followed
him
resolved
to
seem
cheerful
the
study
was
an
oblong
room
and
on
one
side
rose
almost
to
the
ceiling
the
opposite
wall
between
the
windows
was
covered
with
paintings
and
several
statues
stood
in
the
recesses
near
the
chimney
over
the
low
marble
mantelpiece
hung
a
portrait
shrouded
with
black
crape
and
underneath
was
an
exquisitely
chased
silver
case
containing
a
small
swiss
clock
a
beautiful
vase
of
antique
shape
stood
on
the
hearth
filled
with
choice
and
fragrant
flowers
and
near
the
window
sat
an
elegant
rosewood
melodeon
a
circular
table
occupied
the
middle
of
the
room
and
here
the
evening
meal
was
already
arranged
beulah
glanced
timidly
around
as
her
conductor
seated
her
beside
the
urn
and
seeing
only
cups
for
two
persons
asked
hesitatingly
shall
i
make
your
tea
now
yes
and
remember
beulah
i
shall
expect
you
to
make
it
every
evening
at
this
hour
breakfast
and
dinner
i
take
with
my
sister
and
pauline
in
the
dining
room
but
my
evenings
are
always
spent
here
there
make
another
cup
for
yourself
a
long
silence
ensued
hartwell
seemed
lost
in
reverie
for
he
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
tablecloth
and
his
head
resting
on
his
hand
his
features
resumed
their
habitual
expression
of
stern
rigidity
and
as
beulah
looked
at
him
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
was
the
same
kind
friend
who
had
been
so
gentle
and
fatherly
in
his
manner
intuitively
she
felt
then
that
she
had
to
deal
with
a
chaotic
passionate
and
moody
nature
and
as
she
marked
the
knitting
of
his
brows
and
the
iron
compression
of
his
lips
her
heart
was
haunted
by
grave
forebodings
while
she
sat
pondering
his
haughty
impenetrable
appearance
a
servant
entered
sir
there
is
a
messenger
at
the
door
his
master
started
slightly
pushed
away
his
cup
and
said
is
the
buggy
ready
yes
sir
waiting
at
the
door
very
well
i
am
coming
the
windows
opened
down
to
the
floor
and
led
into
a
piazza
he
stepped
up
to
one
and
stood
a
moment
as
if
loath
to
quit
his
sanctum
then
turning
round
addressed
beulah
ah
child
i
had
almost
forgotten
you
it
is
time
you
were
asleep
do
you
know
the
way
back
to
your
room
i
can
find
it
said
she
rising
from
the
table
let
me
see
you
at
breakfast
if
you
feel
strong
enough
to
join
us
he
opened
the
door
for
her
and
hurrying
out
beulah
found
her
own
room
without
difficulty
walking
up
to
harriet
whom
she
saw
waiting
for
her
she
said
in
a
grave
determined
manner
you
have
been
very
kind
to
me
since
i
came
here
and
i
feel
grateful
to
you
but
i
have
not
been
accustomed
to
have
someone
always
waiting
on
me
and
in
future
i
shall
not
want
you
i
can
dress
myself
without
any
assistance
so
you
need
not
come
to
me
night
and
morning
i
am
obeying
master
orders
he
said
i
was
to
to
you
answered
harriet
wondering
at
the
independent
spirit
evinced
by
the
newcomer
i
do
not
want
any
tending
so
you
may
leave
me
if
you
please
have
you
been
here
long
enough
to
find
out
that
you
might
as
well
fight
the
waves
of
the
sea
as
my
master
will
take
care
child
how
you
begin
to
countermand
his
orders
for
i
tell
you
now
there
are
some
in
this
house
who
will
soon
make
it
a
handle
to
turn
you
out
into
the
world
again
mind
what
i
say
do
you
mean
that
i
am
not
wanted
here
i
mean
keep
your
eyes
open
harriet
vanished
in
the
dark
passage
and
beulah
locked
the
door
feeling
that
now
she
was
indeed
alone
and
could
freely
indulge
the
grief
that
had
so
long
sought
to
veil
itself
from
curious
eyes
yet
there
was
no
disposition
to
cry
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
mused
on
the
strange
freak
of
fortune
which
had
so
suddenly
elevated
the
humble
nurse
into
the
possessor
of
that
elegantly
furnished
apartment
there
was
no
elation
in
the
quiet
wonder
with
which
she
surveyed
the
change
in
her
position
she
did
not
belong
there
she
had
no
claim
on
the
master
of
the
house
and
she
felt
that
she
was
trespassing
on
the
rights
of
the
beautiful
pauline
rapidly
plans
for
the
future
were
written
in
firm
resolve
she
would
thankfully
remain
under
the
roof
that
had
so
kindly
sheltered
her
until
she
could
qualify
herself
to
teach
she
would
ask
hartwell
to
give
her
an
education
which
once
obtained
would
enable
her
to
repay
its
price
to
her
proud
nature
there
was
something
galling
in
the
thought
of
dependence
and
throwing
herself
on
her
knees
for
the
first
time
in
several
weeks
she
earnestly
besought
the
god
of
orphans
to
guide
and
assist
her
chapter
ix
do
you
wish
her
to
commence
school
at
once
not
until
her
wardrobe
has
been
replenished
i
expect
her
clothes
to
be
selected
and
made
just
as
pauline
are
will
you
attend
to
this
business
or
shall
i
give
directions
to
harriet
certainly
guy
i
can
easily
arrange
it
you
intend
to
dress
her
just
as
i
do
pauline
as
nearly
as
possible
next
week
i
wish
her
to
begin
school
with
pauline
and
hansell
will
give
her
music
lessons
be
so
good
as
to
see
about
her
clothes
immediately
hartwell
drew
on
his
gloves
and
left
the
room
his
sister
followed
him
to
the
door
where
his
buggy
awaited
him
guy
did
you
determine
about
that
little
affair
for
pauline
she
has
so
set
her
heart
on
it
oh
do
as
you
please
may
only
i
am
stop
uncle
guy
wait
a
minute
may
i
have
a
birthday
party
may
i
almost
out
of
breath
pauline
ran
up
the
steps
her
long
hair
floating
over
her
face
which
exercise
had
flushed
to
crimson
you
young
tornado
look
how
you
have
crushed
that
cluster
of
heliotrope
rushing
over
the
as
if
there
were
no
walks
he
pointed
with
the
end
of
his
whip
to
a
drooping
spray
of
purple
blossoms
yes
but
there
are
plenty
more
i
say
may
i
may
i
she
eagerly
caught
hold
of
his
coat
how
long
before
your
birthday
just
a
week
from
do
please
let
me
have
a
frolic
poor
child
you
look
as
if
you
needed
some
relaxation
said
he
looking
down
into
her
radiant
face
with
an
expression
of
mock
compassion
upon
my
word
uncle
guy
it
is
awfully
dull
here
if
it
were
not
for
charon
and
mazeppa
i
should
be
moped
to
death
do
pray
look
at
me
as
if
you
were
counting
the
hairs
in
my
eyelashes
come
say
yes
do
uncle
guy
take
your
hands
off
of
my
coat
and
have
as
many
parties
as
you
like
provided
you
keep
to
your
own
side
of
the
house
do
come
near
my
study
with
your
babel
and
do
allow
your
company
to
demolish
my
flowers
mind
not
a
soul
is
to
enter
the
greenhouse
the
parlors
are
at
your
service
but
i
will
not
have
a
regiment
of
wildcats
tearing
up
and
down
my
greenhouse
and
flower
garden
mind
that
he
stepped
into
his
buggy
bravo
i
have
won
my
wager
and
got
the
party
too
hugh
cluis
bet
me
a
that
you
would
not
give
me
a
party
when
i
send
his
invitation
i
will
write
on
the
envelope
is
also
expected
hey
shadow
where
did
you
creep
from
she
fixed
her
merry
eyes
on
beulah
who
just
then
appeared
on
the
terrace
hartwell
leaned
from
the
buggy
and
looked
earnestly
at
the
quiet
little
figure
do
you
want
anything
beulah
no
sir
i
thought
you
had
gone
may
i
open
the
gate
for
you
certainly
if
you
wish
to
do
something
for
me
his
pale
features
relaxed
and
his
whole
face
lighted
up
like
a
cloud
beulah
walked
down
the
avenue
lined
on
either
side
with
venerable
poplars
and
cedars
and
opened
the
large
gate
leading
into
the
city
he
checked
his
horse
and
said
thank
you
my
child
now
how
are
you
going
to
spend
the
day
remember
you
commence
with
school
duties
next
week
so
make
the
best
of
your
holiday
i
have
enough
to
occupy
me
sir
for
an
hour
or
so
he
smiled
kindly
and
drove
on
while
she
walked
slowly
back
to
the
house
wondering
why
smiles
were
such
rare
things
in
this
world
when
they
cost
so
little
and
yet
are
so
very
valuable
to
mourning
hearts
pauline
sat
on
the
steps
with
an
open
book
in
her
hand
she
looked
up
as
beulah
approached
and
exclaimed
gayly
are
you
glad
i
am
to
have
my
birthday
frolic
yes
i
am
glad
on
your
account
answered
beulah
gravely
can
you
dance
all
the
fancy
dances
i
do
like
any
so
well
as
the
mazourka
i
do
not
dance
at
all
do
dance
why
i
have
danced
ever
since
i
was
big
enough
to
crawl
what
have
you
been
doing
all
your
life
that
you
do
know
how
to
dance
my
feet
have
had
other
work
to
do
replied
her
companion
and
as
the
recollections
of
her
early
childhood
flitted
before
her
the
brow
darkened
i
suppose
that
is
one
reason
you
look
so
forlorn
all
the
time
i
will
ask
uncle
guy
to
send
you
to
the
dancing
school
for
pauline
it
is
and
you
do
know
one
word
of
that
quackenbos
i
would
be
ashamed
to
start
from
home
as
ignorant
of
my
lessons
as
you
are
chilton
head
was
projected
from
the
parlor
window
and
the
rebuke
was
delivered
in
no
very
gentle
tone
oh
i
do
mind
it
at
all
i
have
got
used
to
it
answered
the
daughter
tossing
up
the
book
as
she
spoke
get
ready
for
school
this
minute
pauline
scampered
into
the
house
for
her
bonnet
and
sachel
and
fixing
her
eyes
upon
beulah
chilton
asked
sternly
what
are
you
doing
out
there
what
did
you
follow
my
brother
to
the
gate
for
answer
me
i
merely
opened
the
gate
for
him
replied
the
girl
looking
steadily
up
at
the
searching
eyes
there
was
a
servant
with
him
to
do
that
in
future
do
make
yourself
so
conspicuous
you
must
keep
away
from
the
flower
beds
too
the
doctor
wishes
no
one
prowling
about
them
he
gave
particular
directions
that
no
one
should
go
there
in
his
absence
they
eyed
each
other
an
instant
then
drawing
up
her
slender
form
to
its
utmost
height
beulah
replied
proudly
be
assured
madam
i
shall
not
trespass
on
forbidden
ground
very
well
the
lace
curtains
swept
back
to
their
place
the
fair
face
was
withdrawn
she
hates
me
thought
beulah
walking
on
to
her
own
room
she
hates
me
and
certainly
i
do
not
love
her
i
shall
like
pauline
very
much
but
her
mother
and
i
never
will
get
on
smoothly
what
freezing
eyes
she
has
and
what
a
disagreeable
look
there
is
about
her
mouth
whenever
she
sees
me
she
wishes
me
to
remember
all
the
time
that
i
am
poor
and
that
she
is
the
mistress
of
this
elegant
house
ah
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
it
the
old
smile
of
bitterness
crossed
her
face
the
days
passed
swiftly
beulah
spent
most
of
her
time
in
her
own
room
for
hartwell
was
sometimes
absent
all
day
and
she
longed
to
escape
his
sister
icy
espionage
when
he
was
at
home
and
not
engaged
in
his
study
his
manner
was
always
kind
and
considerate
but
she
fancied
he
was
colder
and
graver
and
often
his
stern
abstraction
kept
her
silent
when
they
were
together
monday
was
the
birthday
and
on
monday
morning
she
expected
to
start
to
school
madam
cymon
was
the
fashionable
institution
of
the
city
and
thither
with
pauline
she
was
destined
beulah
rose
early
dressed
herself
carefully
and
after
reading
a
chapter
in
her
bible
and
asking
god
special
guidance
through
the
day
descended
to
the
breakfast
room
hartwell
sat
reading
a
newspaper
he
did
not
look
up
and
she
quietly
seated
herself
unobserved
presently
chilton
entered
and
walked
up
to
her
brother
guy
are
there
no
tidings
of
that
vessel
yet
i
hear
the
grahams
are
terribly
anxious
about
it
cornelia
said
her
father
was
unable
to
sleep
no
news
yet
but
may
be
sure
you
do
not
let
was
it
the
star
is
he
lost
beulah
stood
crouching
at
his
side
with
her
hands
extended
pleadingly
and
her
white
face
convulsed
my
child
do
not
look
so
wretched
the
vessel
that
eugene
sailed
in
was
disabled
in
a
storm
and
has
not
yet
reached
the
place
of
destination
but
there
are
numerous
ways
of
accounting
for
the
detention
and
you
must
hope
and
believe
that
all
is
well
until
you
know
the
contrary
he
drew
her
to
his
side
and
stroked
her
head
compassionately
i
knew
it
would
be
so
said
she
in
a
strangely
subdued
passionless
tone
what
do
you
mean
child
death
and
trouble
come
on
everything
i
love
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
eugene
may
be
writing
you
an
account
of
his
voyage
i
believe
that
we
shall
soon
hear
of
his
safe
arrival
you
need
not
dive
down
into
my
eyes
in
that
way
i
do
believe
it
for
the
vessel
was
seen
after
the
storm
and
though
far
out
of
the
right
track
there
is
good
reason
to
suppose
she
has
put
into
some
port
to
be
repaired
beulah
clasped
her
hands
over
her
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
some
horrid
phantom
and
while
her
heart
seemed
dying
on
the
rack
she
resolved
not
to
despair
till
the
certainty
came
time
enough
when
there
is
no
hope
i
will
not
go
out
to
meet
sorrow
with
a
sudden
inexplicable
revulsion
of
feeling
she
sank
on
her
knees
and
there
beside
her
protector
vehemently
prayed
almighty
god
to
guard
and
guide
the
loved
one
if
her
eyes
had
rested
on
the
face
of
deity
and
she
had
felt
his
presence
her
petition
could
not
have
been
more
importunately
preferred
for
a
few
moments
hartwell
regarded
her
curiously
then
his
brow
darkened
his
lips
curled
sneeringly
and
a
mocking
smile
passed
over
his
face
chilton
smiled
too
but
there
was
a
peculiar
gleam
in
her
eyes
and
an
uplifting
of
her
brows
which
denoted
anything
but
pleasurable
emotions
she
moved
away
and
sat
down
at
the
head
of
the
table
hartwell
put
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
kneeling
girl
and
asked
rather
abruptly
beulah
do
you
believe
that
the
god
you
pray
to
hears
you
i
do
he
has
promised
to
answer
prayer
then
get
up
and
be
satisfied
and
eat
your
breakfast
you
have
asked
him
to
save
and
protect
eugene
and
according
to
the
bible
he
will
certainly
do
it
so
no
more
tears
if
you
believe
in
your
god
what
are
you
looking
so
wretched
about
there
was
something
in
all
this
that
startled
beulah
and
she
looked
up
at
him
his
chilly
smile
pained
her
and
she
rose
quickly
while
again
and
again
his
words
rang
in
her
ear
yet
what
was
there
so
strange
about
this
application
of
faith
true
the
bible
declared
that
whatsoever
ye
ask
believing
that
ye
shall
receive
yet
she
had
often
prayed
for
blessings
and
often
been
denied
was
it
because
she
had
not
had
the
requisite
faith
which
should
have
satisfied
her
yet
god
knew
that
she
had
trusted
him
with
innate
quickness
of
perception
she
detected
the
tissued
veil
of
irony
which
the
doctor
had
wrapped
about
his
attempted
consolation
and
she
looked
at
him
so
intently
so
piercingly
that
he
hastily
turned
away
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
just
then
pauline
bounded
into
the
room
exclaiming
fourteen
only
three
more
years
at
school
and
then
i
shall
step
out
a
brilliant
young
lady
the
there
be
quiet
sit
down
i
would
almost
as
soon
select
a
small
whirlwind
for
a
companion
ca
you
learn
to
enter
a
room
without
blustering
like
a
march
wind
or
a
texan
norther
asked
her
uncle
have
you
all
seen
a
ghost
you
look
as
solemn
as
what
ails
you
beulah
come
along
to
breakfast
how
nice
you
look
in
your
new
clothes
her
eyes
ran
over
the
face
and
form
of
the
orphan
pauline
hush
and
eat
your
breakfast
you
annoy
your
uncle
said
her
mother
severely
oh
do
for
gracious
sake
let
me
talk
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
should
suffocate
everything
about
this
house
is
so
demure
and
silent
and
solemn
and
quakerish
and
hatefully
prim
if
ever
i
have
a
house
of
my
own
i
mean
to
paste
in
great
letters
over
the
doors
and
windows
and
talking
freely
allowed
this
is
my
birthday
and
i
think
i
might
stay
at
home
mother
do
forget
to
have
the
ends
of
my
sash
fringed
and
the
tops
of
my
gloves
trimmed
draining
her
small
china
cup
she
sprang
up
from
the
table
but
paused
beside
beulah
by
the
by
what
are
you
going
to
wear
beulah
i
shall
not
go
into
the
parlors
at
all
answered
the
latter
why
not
said
hartwell
looking
suddenly
up
he
met
the
sad
suffering
expression
of
the
gray
eyes
and
bit
his
lip
with
vexation
she
saw
that
he
understood
her
feelings
and
made
no
reply
i
shall
not
like
it
if
you
do
come
to
my
party
said
pauline
slowly
and
as
she
spoke
she
took
one
of
the
orphan
hands
you
are
very
kind
pauline
but
i
do
not
wish
to
see
strangers
but
you
never
will
know
anybody
if
you
make
such
a
nun
of
yourself
uncle
guy
tell
her
she
must
come
down
into
the
parlors
not
unless
she
wishes
to
do
so
but
pauline
i
am
very
glad
that
you
have
shown
her
you
desire
her
presence
he
put
his
hand
on
her
curly
head
and
looked
with
more
than
usual
affection
at
the
bright
honest
face
beulah
you
must
get
ready
for
school
come
down
as
soon
as
you
can
pauline
will
be
waiting
for
you
chilton
spoke
in
the
calm
sweet
tone
peculiar
to
her
and
her
brother
but
to
beulah
there
was
something
repulsive
in
that
even
voice
and
she
hurried
from
the
sound
of
it
kneeling
beside
her
bed
she
again
implored
the
father
to
restore
eugene
to
her
and
crushing
her
grief
and
apprehension
down
into
her
heart
she
resolved
to
veil
it
from
strangers
as
she
walked
on
by
pauline
side
only
the
excessive
paleness
of
her
face
and
drooping
of
her
eyelashes
betokened
her
suffering
entering
school
is
always
a
disagreeable
ordeal
and
to
a
sensitive
nature
such
as
beulah
it
was
torturing
madam
cymon
was
a
kind
little
body
and
received
her
with
a
warmth
and
cordiality
which
made
amends
in
some
degree
for
the
battery
of
eyes
she
was
forced
to
encounter
ah
yes
the
doctor
called
to
see
me
about
you
wants
you
to
take
the
latin
course
for
the
present
my
dear
you
will
sit
with
miss
sanders
clara
take
this
young
lady
with
you
the
girl
addressed
looked
at
least
sixteen
years
of
age
and
rising
promptly
she
come
forward
and
led
beulah
to
a
seat
at
her
desk
which
was
constructed
for
two
persons
the
touch
of
her
fingers
sent
a
thrill
through
beulah
frame
and
she
looked
at
her
very
earnestly
clara
sanders
was
not
a
beauty
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
but
there
was
an
expression
of
angelic
sweetness
and
purity
in
her
countenance
which
fascinated
the
orphan
she
remarked
the
scrutiny
of
the
young
stranger
and
smiling
said
as
she
leaned
over
and
arranged
the
desk
i
am
glad
to
have
you
with
me
and
dare
say
we
shall
get
on
very
nicely
together
you
look
i
have
been
ill
recently
and
have
not
yet
regained
my
strength
can
you
tell
me
where
i
can
find
some
water
i
feel
rather
faint
her
companion
brought
her
a
glass
of
water
she
drank
it
eagerly
and
as
clara
resumed
her
seat
said
in
a
low
voice
oh
thank
you
you
are
very
kind
not
at
all
if
you
feel
worse
you
must
let
me
know
she
turned
to
her
books
and
soon
forgot
the
presence
of
the
newcomer
the
latter
watched
her
and
noticed
now
that
she
was
dressed
in
deep
mourning
was
she
too
an
orphan
and
had
this
circumstance
rendered
her
so
kindly
sympathetic
the
sweet
gentle
face
with
its
soft
brown
eyes
chained
her
attention
and
in
the
shaping
of
the
mouth
there
was
something
very
like
lilly
soon
clara
left
her
for
recitation
and
then
she
turned
to
the
new
books
which
madam
had
sent
to
her
desk
thus
passed
the
morning
and
she
started
when
the
recess
bell
rang
its
summons
through
the
long
room
bustle
chatter
and
confusion
ensued
pauline
called
to
her
to
come
into
lunchroom
and
touched
her
little
basket
as
she
spoke
but
beulah
shook
her
head
and
kept
her
seat
clara
also
remained
pauline
is
calling
you
said
she
gently
yes
i
hear
but
i
do
not
want
anything
and
beulah
rested
her
head
on
her
hands
do
you
feel
better
than
you
did
this
morning
oh
i
am
well
enough
in
body
a
little
weak
that
is
all
you
look
quite
tired
suppose
you
lean
your
head
against
me
and
take
a
short
nap
you
are
very
good
indeed
but
i
am
not
at
all
sleepy
clara
was
engaged
in
drawing
and
looking
on
beulah
became
interested
in
the
progress
of
the
sketch
suddenly
a
hand
was
placed
over
the
paper
and
a
tall
handsome
girl
with
black
eyes
and
sallow
complexion
exclaimed
sharply
for
heaven
sake
clara
sanders
do
you
expect
to
swim
into
the
next
world
on
a
piece
of
come
over
to
my
seat
and
work
out
that
eighth
problem
for
me
i
have
puzzled
over
it
all
the
morning
and
ca
get
it
right
i
can
show
you
here
quite
as
well
taking
out
her
euclid
she
found
and
explained
the
obstinate
problem
thank
you
i
can
not
endure
mathematics
but
father
is
bent
upon
my
being
as
he
calls
it
i
think
it
is
all
thorough
nonsense
now
with
you
it
is
very
different
you
expect
to
be
a
teacher
and
of
course
will
have
to
acquire
all
these
branches
but
for
my
part
i
see
no
use
in
it
i
shall
be
rejoiced
when
this
dull
is
over
do
say
that
cornelia
i
think
our
school
days
are
the
happiest
and
feel
sad
when
i
remember
that
mine
are
numbered
here
the
bell
announced
recess
over
and
cornelia
moved
away
to
her
seat
a
trembling
hand
sought
clara
arm
is
that
cornelia
graham
yes
is
she
not
very
handsome
beulah
made
no
answer
she
only
remembered
that
this
girl
was
eugene
adopted
sister
and
looking
after
the
tall
queenly
form
she
longed
to
follow
her
and
ask
all
the
particulars
of
the
storm
thus
ended
the
first
dreaded
day
at
school
and
on
reaching
home
beulah
threw
herself
on
her
bed
with
a
low
wailing
cry
the
pent
sorrow
must
have
vent
and
she
sobbed
until
weariness
sank
her
into
a
heavy
sleep
far
out
in
a
billowy
sea
strewed
with
wrecks
and
hideous
with
the
ghastly
upturned
faces
of
floating
corpses
she
and
eugene
were
drifting
now
clinging
to
each
other
now
tossed
asunder
by
howling
waves
then
came
a
glimmering
sail
on
the
wide
waste
of
waters
a
little
boat
neared
them
and
lilly
leaned
over
the
side
and
held
out
tiny
dimpled
hands
to
lift
them
in
they
were
climbing
out
of
their
watery
graves
and
lilly
long
fair
curls
already
touched
their
cheeks
when
a
strong
arm
snatched
lilly
back
and
struck
them
down
into
the
roaring
gulf
and
above
the
white
faces
of
the
drifting
dead
stood
grayson
sailing
away
with
lilly
struggling
in
her
arms
eugene
was
sinking
and
beulah
could
not
reach
him
he
held
up
his
arms
imploringly
toward
her
and
called
upon
her
to
save
him
and
then
his
head
with
its
wealth
of
silken
brown
locks
disappeared
she
ceased
to
struggle
she
welcomed
drowning
now
that
he
had
gone
to
rest
among
coral
temples
she
sank
down
down
the
rigid
corpses
were
no
longer
visible
she
was
in
an
emerald
palace
and
myriads
of
rosy
shells
paved
the
floors
at
last
she
found
eugene
reposing
on
a
coral
bank
and
playing
with
pearls
she
hastened
to
join
him
and
was
just
taking
his
hand
when
a
horrible
phantom
seizing
him
in
its
arms
bore
him
away
and
looking
in
its
face
she
saw
that
it
was
chilton
with
a
wild
scream
of
terror
beulah
awoke
she
was
lying
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
both
hands
were
thrown
up
grasping
the
post
convulsively
the
room
was
dark
save
where
the
moonlight
crept
through
the
curtains
and
fell
slantingly
on
the
picture
of
hope
and
the
pilgrims
and
by
that
dim
light
she
saw
a
tall
form
standing
near
her
were
you
dreaming
beulah
that
you
shrieked
so
wildly
the
doctor
lifted
her
up
and
leaned
her
head
against
his
shoulder
oh
hartwell
i
have
had
a
horrible
horrible
dream
she
shuddered
and
clung
to
him
tightly
as
if
dreading
it
might
still
prove
a
reality
poor
child
come
with
me
and
i
will
try
to
exorcise
this
evil
spirit
which
haunts
even
your
slumbers
keeping
her
hand
in
his
he
led
her
down
to
his
study
and
seated
her
on
a
couch
drawn
near
the
window
the
confused
sound
of
many
voices
and
the
tread
of
dancing
feet
keeping
time
to
a
band
of
music
came
indistinctly
from
the
parlors
hartwell
closed
the
door
to
shut
out
the
unwelcome
sounds
and
seating
himself
before
the
melodeon
poured
a
flood
of
soothing
plaintive
melody
upon
the
air
beulah
sat
entranced
while
he
played
on
and
on
as
if
unconscious
of
her
presence
her
whole
being
was
inexpressibly
thrilled
and
forgetting
her
frightful
vision
her
enraptured
soul
hovered
on
the
very
confines
of
fabled
elysium
sliding
from
the
couch
upon
her
knees
she
remained
with
her
clasped
hands
pressed
over
her
heart
only
conscious
of
her
trembling
delight
once
or
twice
before
she
had
felt
thus
in
watching
a
gorgeous
sunset
in
the
old
pine
grove
and
now
as
the
musician
seemed
to
play
upon
her
calling
thence
unearthly
tones
the
tears
rolled
swiftly
over
her
face
images
of
divine
beauty
filled
her
soul
and
nobler
aspirations
than
she
had
ever
known
took
possession
of
her
soon
the
tears
ceased
the
face
became
calm
singularly
calm
then
lighted
with
an
expression
which
nothing
earthly
could
have
kindled
it
was
the
look
of
one
whose
spirit
escaping
from
gross
bondage
soared
into
realms
divine
and
proclaimed
itself
hartwell
was
watching
her
countenance
and
as
the
expression
of
indescribable
joy
and
triumph
flashed
over
it
he
involuntarily
paused
she
waited
till
the
last
deep
echoing
tone
died
away
and
then
approaching
him
as
he
still
sat
before
the
instrument
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
knee
and
said
slowly
oh
thank
you
i
can
bear
anything
now
can
you
explain
to
me
how
the
music
strengthened
you
try
will
you
she
mused
for
some
moments
and
answered
thoughtfully
first
it
made
me
forget
the
pain
of
my
dream
then
it
caused
me
to
think
of
the
wonderful
power
which
created
music
and
then
from
remembering
the
infinite
love
and
wisdom
of
the
creator
who
has
given
man
the
power
to
call
out
this
music
i
thought
how
very
noble
man
was
and
what
he
was
capable
of
doing
and
at
last
i
was
glad
because
god
has
given
me
some
of
these
powers
and
though
i
am
ugly
and
have
been
afflicted
in
losing
my
dear
loved
ones
yet
i
was
made
for
god
glory
in
some
way
and
am
yet
to
be
shown
the
work
he
has
laid
out
for
me
to
do
oh
sir
i
ca
explain
it
all
to
you
but
i
do
know
that
god
will
prove
to
me
that
doeth
all
things
well
she
looked
gravely
up
into
the
face
beside
her
and
sought
to
read
its
baffling
characters
he
had
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
melodeon
and
his
fingers
were
thrust
through
his
hair
his
brow
was
smooth
and
his
mouth
at
rest
but
the
dark
eyes
with
their
melancholy
splendor
looked
down
at
her
moodily
they
met
her
gaze
steadily
and
then
she
saw
into
the
misty
depths
and
a
shudder
crept
over
her
as
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
said
shiveringly
oh
sir
can
it
be
he
put
his
hand
on
her
head
and
asked
quietly
can
what
be
child
have
you
no
god
his
face
grew
whiter
than
was
his
wont
a
scowl
of
bitterness
settled
on
it
and
the
eyes
burned
with
an
almost
unearthly
brilliance
as
he
rose
and
walked
away
for
some
time
he
stood
before
the
window
with
his
arms
folded
and
laying
her
head
on
the
stool
of
the
melodeon
beulah
knelt
just
as
he
left
her
it
has
been
said
who
can
refute
a
sneer
rather
ask
who
can
compute
its
ruinous
effects
to
that
kneeling
figure
came
the
thought
if
he
surrounded
by
wealth
and
friends
and
blessings
can
not
believe
in
god
what
cause
have
i
poor
wretched
and
lonely
to
have
faith
in
him
the
bare
suggestion
of
the
doubt
stamped
it
on
her
memory
yet
she
shrank
with
horror
from
the
idea
and
an
eager
voiceless
prayer
ascended
from
her
heart
that
she
might
be
shielded
from
such
temptations
in
future
hartwell
touched
her
and
said
in
his
usual
low
musical
tones
it
is
time
you
were
asleep
do
not
indulge
in
any
more
horrible
dreams
if
you
please
beulah
whenever
you
feel
that
you
would
like
to
have
some
music
do
not
hesitate
to
ask
me
for
it
he
held
open
the
door
for
her
to
pass
out
she
longed
to
ask
him
what
he
lived
for
if
eternity
had
no
joys
for
him
but
looking
in
his
pale
face
she
saw
from
the
lips
and
eyes
that
he
would
not
suffer
any
questioning
and
awed
by
the
expression
of
his
countenance
she
said
and
hurried
away
the
merry
hum
of
childish
voices
again
fell
on
her
ear
and
as
she
ascended
the
steps
a
bevy
of
girls
emerged
from
a
room
near
and
walked
on
just
below
her
pauline
party
was
at
its
height
beulah
looked
down
on
the
fairy
gossamer
robes
and
gayly
tripping
girls
and
then
hastened
to
her
own
room
while
the
thought
presented
itself
why
are
things
divided
so
unequally
in
this
world
why
do
some
have
all
of
joy
and
some
only
sorrow
brimming
cup
to
drain
but
the
sweet
voice
of
faith
answered
what
i
do
thou
knowest
not
now
but
thou
shalt
know
hereafter
and
trusting
the
promise
she
was
content
to
wait
chapter
x
cornelia
graham
i
want
to
know
why
you
did
not
come
to
my
party
you
might
at
least
have
honored
me
with
an
excuse
such
was
pauline
salutation
the
following
day
when
the
girls
gathered
in
groups
about
the
schoolroom
why
pauline
i
did
send
an
excuse
but
it
was
addressed
to
your
mother
and
probably
she
forgot
to
mention
it
you
must
acquit
me
of
any
such
rudeness
well
but
why
did
you
come
we
had
a
glorious
time
i
have
half
a
mind
not
to
tell
you
what
i
heard
said
of
you
but
i
believe
you
may
have
it
fred
vincent
was
as
grum
as
a
preacher
all
the
evening
and
when
i
asked
him
what
on
earth
made
him
so
surly
and
owlish
he
said
was
too
provoking
you
would
not
come
for
no
one
else
could
dance
the
schottisch
to
his
liking
now
there
was
a
sweet
specimen
of
manners
for
you
you
had
better
teach
your
beau
politeness
cornelia
was
leaning
listlessly
against
clara
desk
and
beulah
fancied
she
looked
very
sad
and
abstracted
she
colored
at
the
jest
and
answered
contemptuously
he
is
no
beau
of
mine
let
me
tell
you
and
as
for
manners
i
commend
him
to
your
merciful
tuition
but
what
was
your
excuse
persisted
pauline
i
should
think
you
might
conjecture
that
i
felt
no
inclination
to
go
to
parties
and
dance
when
you
know
that
we
are
all
so
anxious
about
my
brother
oh
i
did
not
think
of
that
cried
the
heedless
girl
and
quite
as
heedlessly
she
continued
i
want
to
see
that
brother
of
yours
uncle
guy
says
he
is
the
handsomest
boy
in
the
city
and
promises
to
make
something
extraordinary
is
he
so
very
handsome
yes
the
proud
lip
trembled
i
heard
anne
vernon
say
she
liked
him
better
than
all
her
other
beaux
and
that
is
great
praise
coming
from
her
queenship
said
emily
wood
who
stood
near
cornelia
eyes
dilated
angrily
as
she
answered
with
curling
lips
eugene
one
of
her
beaux
it
is
no
such
thing
you
need
not
look
so
insulted
i
suppose
if
the
matter
is
such
a
delicate
one
with
you
anne
will
withdraw
her
claim
sneered
emily
happy
in
the
opportunity
afforded
of
wounding
the
haughty
spirit
whom
all
feared
and
few
sympathized
with
cornelia
was
about
to
retort
but
madam
voice
prevented
as
leaning
from
the
platform
opposite
she
held
out
a
note
and
said
miss
graham
a
servant
has
just
brought
this
for
you
the
girl
face
flushed
and
paled
alternately
as
she
received
the
note
and
broke
the
seal
with
trembling
fingers
glancing
over
the
contents
her
countenance
became
irradiated
and
she
exclaimed
joyfully
good
news
the
star
has
arrived
at
amsterdam
eugene
is
safe
in
germany
beulah
head
went
down
on
her
desk
and
just
audible
were
the
words
my
father
in
heaven
i
thank
thee
only
clara
and
cornelia
heard
the
broken
accents
and
they
looked
curiously
at
the
bowed
figure
quivering
with
joy
ah
i
understand
this
is
the
asylum
beulah
i
have
often
heard
him
speak
of
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
circumstance
you
knew
him
very
well
i
suppose
said
cornelia
addressing
herself
to
the
orphan
and
crumpling
the
note
between
her
fingers
while
her
eyes
ran
with
haughty
scrutiny
over
the
dress
and
features
before
her
yes
i
knew
him
very
well
beulah
felt
the
blood
come
into
her
cheeks
and
she
ill
brooked
the
cold
searching
look
bent
upon
her
you
are
the
same
girl
that
he
asked
my
father
to
send
to
the
public
school
how
came
you
here
a
pair
of
dark
gray
eyes
met
cornelia
gaze
and
seemed
to
answer
defiantly
what
is
it
to
you
has
hartwell
adopted
you
pauline
said
so
but
she
is
so
heedless
that
i
scarcely
believed
her
particularly
when
it
seemed
so
very
improbable
hush
cornelia
why
you
need
pauline
tuition
about
as
much
as
fred
vincent
i
am
disposed
to
think
do
be
so
inquisitive
it
pains
her
remonstrated
clara
laying
her
arm
around
shoulder
as
she
spoke
nonsense
she
is
not
so
fastidious
i
will
warrant
at
least
she
might
answer
civil
questions
i
always
do
said
beulah
cornelia
smiled
derisively
and
turned
off
with
the
parting
taunt
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
what
eugene
can
see
in
such
a
homely
unpolished
specimen
he
pities
her
i
suppose
clara
felt
a
long
shiver
creep
over
the
slight
form
and
saw
the
ashen
hue
that
settled
on
her
face
as
if
some
painful
wound
had
been
inflicted
stooping
down
she
whispered
do
let
it
trouble
you
cornelia
is
hasty
but
she
is
generous
too
and
will
repent
her
rudeness
she
did
not
intend
to
pain
you
it
is
only
her
abrupt
way
of
expressing
herself
beulah
raised
her
head
and
putting
back
the
locks
of
hair
that
had
fallen
over
her
brow
replied
coldly
it
is
nothing
new
i
am
accustomed
to
such
treatment
only
professing
to
love
eugene
i
did
not
expect
her
to
insult
one
whom
he
had
commissioned
her
to
assist
or
at
least
sympathize
with
remember
beulah
she
is
an
only
child
and
her
father
idol
and
perhaps
the
very
blessings
that
surround
her
should
teach
her
to
feel
for
the
unfortunate
and
unprotected
interrupted
the
orphan
you
will
find
that
prosperity
rarely
has
such
an
effect
upon
the
heart
of
its
favorite
answered
clara
musingly
an
unnecessary
piece
of
information
i
discovered
that
pleasant
truth
some
time
since
said
beulah
bitterly
i
do
know
beulah
you
are
an
instance
to
the
contrary
do
not
call
yourself
unfortunate
so
long
as
hartwell
is
your
friend
ah
you
little
dream
how
blessed
you
are
her
voice
took
the
deep
tone
of
intense
feeling
and
a
faint
glow
tinged
her
cheek
yes
he
is
very
kind
very
good
replied
the
other
more
gently
kind
good
is
that
all
you
can
say
of
him
the
soft
brown
eyes
kindled
with
unwonted
enthusiasm
what
more
can
i
say
of
him
than
that
he
is
good
returned
the
orphan
eagerly
while
the
conversation
in
the
study
the
preceding
day
rushed
to
her
recollection
clara
looked
at
her
earnestly
for
a
moment
and
then
averting
her
head
answered
evasively
pardon
me
i
have
no
right
to
dictate
the
terms
in
which
you
should
mention
your
benefactor
beulah
intuitions
were
remarkably
quick
and
she
asked
slowly
do
you
know
him
well
yes
oh
yes
very
well
indeed
why
do
you
ask
and
you
like
him
very
much
very
much
she
saw
the
gentle
face
now
and
saw
that
some
sorrow
had
called
tears
to
the
eyes
and
sent
the
blood
coldly
back
to
her
heart
no
one
can
like
him
as
i
do
you
do
know
how
very
kind
he
has
been
to
me
me
the
miserable
lonely
orphan
murmured
beulah
as
his
smile
and
tones
recurred
to
her
yes
i
can
imagine
because
i
know
his
noble
heart
and
therefore
child
i
say
you
can
not
realize
how
privileged
you
are
the
discussion
was
cut
short
by
a
call
to
recitation
and
too
calmly
happy
in
the
knowledge
of
eugene
safety
to
ponder
her
manner
beulah
sank
into
a
reverie
in
which
eugene
and
heidelberg
and
long
letters
mingled
pleasingly
later
in
the
day
as
she
and
pauline
were
descending
the
steps
the
door
of
the
primary
department
of
the
school
opened
and
a
little
girl
clad
in
deep
black
started
up
the
same
flight
of
steps
seeing
the
two
above
she
leaned
against
the
wall
waiting
for
them
to
pass
beulah
stood
still
and
the
sachel
she
carried
fell
unheeded
from
her
hand
while
a
thrilling
cry
broke
from
the
little
girl
lips
and
springing
up
the
steps
she
threw
herself
into
beulah
arms
dear
beulah
i
have
found
you
at
last
she
covered
the
thin
face
with
passionate
kisses
then
heavy
sobs
escaped
her
and
the
two
wept
bitterly
together
beulah
i
did
love
her
very
much
i
did
not
forget
what
i
promised
you
she
used
to
put
her
arms
around
my
neck
every
night
and
go
to
sleep
close
to
me
and
whenever
she
thought
about
you
and
cried
she
always
put
her
head
in
my
lap
indeed
i
did
love
her
i
believe
you
claudy
poor
beulah
groaned
in
her
anguish
they
did
not
tell
me
she
was
dead
they
said
she
was
sick
in
another
room
oh
beulah
why
did
you
come
to
see
us
why
you
come
when
she
was
first
taken
sick
she
called
for
you
all
the
time
and
the
evening
they
moved
me
into
the
next
room
she
was
asking
for
you
want
my
sister
beulah
i
want
my
beulah
was
the
last
thing
i
heard
her
say
and
when
i
cried
for
you
too
mamma
said
we
were
both
crazy
with
fever
oh
she
paused
and
sobbed
convulsively
beulah
raised
her
head
and
while
the
tears
dried
in
her
flashing
eyes
said
fiercely
claudy
i
did
go
to
see
you
on
my
knees
at
grayson
front
door
i
prayed
her
to
let
me
see
you
she
refused
and
ordered
me
to
come
there
no
more
she
would
not
suffer
my
sister
to
know
that
i
was
waiting
there
on
my
knees
to
see
her
dear
angel
face
that
was
long
before
you
were
taken
sick
she
did
not
even
send
me
word
that
lilly
was
ill
i
knew
nothing
of
it
till
my
darling
was
cold
in
her
little
shroud
oh
claudy
claudy
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
tried
to
stifle
the
wail
that
crossed
her
lips
claudia
endeavored
to
soothe
her
by
winding
her
arms
about
her
and
kissing
her
repeatedly
pauline
had
looked
wonderingly
on
during
this
painful
reunion
and
now
drawing
nearer
she
said
with
more
gentleness
than
was
her
custom
do
grieve
so
beulah
wipe
your
eyes
and
come
home
those
girls
yonder
are
staring
at
you
what
business
is
it
of
yours
began
claudia
but
sensitive
nature
shrank
from
observation
and
rising
hastily
she
took
claudia
to
her
bosom
kissed
her
and
turned
away
oh
beulah
sha
i
see
you
again
cried
the
latter
with
streaming
eyes
claudia
your
mamma
would
not
be
willing
i
do
care
what
she
thinks
please
come
to
see
me
please
do
beulah
you
do
love
me
now
because
lilly
is
dead
oh
i
could
not
keep
her
god
took
her
yes
i
do
love
you
claudy
more
than
ever
but
you
must
come
to
see
me
i
can
not
go
to
that
house
again
i
ca
see
your
mamma
grayson
come
and
see
me
darling
she
drew
her
bonnet
over
her
face
and
hurried
out
where
do
you
live
i
will
come
and
see
you
cried
claudia
running
after
the
retreating
form
she
lives
at
hartwell
that
large
brick
house
out
on
the
edge
of
town
everybody
knows
the
place
pauline
turned
back
to
give
this
piece
of
information
and
then
hastened
on
to
join
beulah
she
longed
to
inquire
into
all
the
particulars
of
the
orphan
early
life
but
the
pale
fixed
face
gave
no
encouragement
to
question
and
they
walked
on
in
perfect
silence
until
they
reached
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
then
pauline
asked
energetically
is
that
little
one
any
kin
to
you
no
i
have
no
kin
in
this
world
answered
beulah
drearily
pauline
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
made
no
further
attempt
to
elicit
confidence
on
entering
the
house
they
encountered
the
doctor
who
was
crossing
the
hall
he
stopped
and
said
i
have
glad
tidings
for
you
beulah
the
star
arrived
safely
at
amsterdam
and
by
this
time
eugene
is
at
heidelberg
beulah
stood
very
near
him
and
answered
tremblingly
yes
sir
i
heard
it
at
school
he
perceived
that
something
was
amiss
and
untying
her
bonnet
looked
searchingly
at
the
face
she
shut
her
eyes
and
leaned
her
head
against
him
what
is
the
matter
my
child
i
thought
you
would
be
very
happy
in
hearing
of
eugene
safety
she
was
unable
to
reply
just
then
and
pauline
who
stood
swinging
her
sachel
to
and
fro
volunteered
an
explanation
uncle
guy
she
is
curious
that
is
all
as
we
were
leaving
school
she
met
a
little
girl
on
the
steps
and
they
flew
at
each
other
and
cried
and
kissed
and
you
never
saw
anything
like
it
i
thought
the
child
must
be
a
very
dear
relation
but
she
says
she
has
no
kin
i
do
see
the
use
of
crying
her
eyes
out
particularly
when
the
little
one
is
nothing
to
her
her
uncle
countenance
resumed
its
habitual
severity
and
taking
beulah
hand
he
led
her
into
that
quietest
of
all
quiet
places
his
study
seating
himself
and
drawing
her
to
his
side
he
said
was
it
meeting
claudia
that
distressed
you
so
much
that
child
is
very
warmly
attached
to
you
she
raved
about
you
constantly
during
her
illness
so
did
lilly
i
did
not
understand
the
relationship
then
or
i
should
have
interfered
and
carried
you
to
her
i
called
to
see
and
grayson
last
week
to
remove
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
your
intercourse
with
claudia
but
they
were
not
at
home
i
will
arrange
matters
so
that
you
may
be
with
claudia
as
often
as
possible
you
have
been
wronged
child
i
know
but
try
to
bury
it
it
is
all
past
now
he
softly
smoothed
back
her
hair
as
he
spoke
no
sir
it
never
will
be
past
it
will
always
be
burning
here
in
my
heart
i
thought
you
professed
to
believe
in
the
bible
she
looked
up
instantly
and
answered
i
do
sir
i
do
then
your
belief
is
perfectly
worthless
for
the
bible
charges
you
to
and
love
your
enemies
and
here
you
are
trying
to
fan
your
hate
into
an
everlasting
flame
she
saw
the
scornful
curl
of
his
lips
and
sinking
down
beside
him
she
laid
her
head
on
his
knee
and
said
hastily
i
know
it
is
wrong
sinful
to
feel
toward
grayson
as
i
do
yes
sir
the
bible
tells
me
it
is
very
sinful
but
i
have
been
so
miserable
i
could
not
help
hating
her
but
i
will
try
to
do
so
no
more
i
will
ask
god
to
help
me
forgive
her
his
face
flushed
even
to
his
temples
and
then
the
blood
receded
leaving
it
like
sculptured
marble
unable
or
unwilling
to
answer
he
put
his
hands
on
her
head
softly
reverently
as
though
he
touched
something
ethereal
he
little
dreamed
that
even
then
that
suffering
heart
was
uplifted
to
the
throne
of
grace
praying
the
father
that
she
might
so
live
and
govern
herself
that
he
might
come
to
believe
the
bible
which
her
clear
insight
too
surely
told
her
he
despised
oh
protean
temptation
even
as
she
knelt
with
her
hands
resting
on
her
brow
ubiquitous
evil
suggested
the
thought
is
he
not
kinder
and
better
than
anyone
you
ever
knew
has
not
grayson
a
pew
in
the
most
fashionable
church
did
not
eugene
tell
you
he
saw
her
there
regularly
every
sunday
professing
christianity
she
injured
you
rejecting
it
he
has
guarded
and
most
generously
aided
you
their
fruits
ye
shall
judge
very
dimly
all
this
passed
through
her
mind
she
was
perplexed
and
troubled
at
the
confused
ideas
veiling
her
trust
beulah
i
have
an
engagement
and
must
leave
you
stay
here
if
you
like
or
do
as
you
please
with
yourself
i
shall
not
be
home
to
tea
so
she
looked
pained
but
remained
silent
he
smiled
and
drawing
out
his
watch
said
gayly
i
verily
believe
you
miss
me
when
i
leave
you
go
put
on
your
other
bonnet
and
come
down
to
the
front
door
i
have
nearly
an
hour
yet
i
see
and
will
give
you
a
short
ride
hurry
child
i
like
to
wait
she
was
soon
seated
beside
him
in
the
buggy
and
mazeppa
swift
feet
had
borne
them
some
distance
from
home
ere
either
spoke
the
road
ran
near
the
bay
and
while
elegant
residences
lined
one
side
the
other
was
bounded
by
a
wide
expanse
of
water
rippling
sparkling
glowing
in
the
evening
sunlight
small
sail
boats
with
their
gleaming
canvas
dotted
the
blue
bosom
of
the
bay
and
the
balmy
breeze
fresh
from
the
gulf
fluttered
the
bright
pennons
that
floated
from
their
masts
beulah
was
watching
the
snowy
wall
of
foam
piled
on
either
side
of
the
prow
of
a
schooner
and
thinking
how
very
beautiful
it
was
when
the
buggy
stopped
suddenly
and
hartwell
addressed
a
gentleman
on
horseback
percy
you
may
expect
me
i
am
coming
as
i
promised
i
was
about
to
remind
you
of
your
engagement
but
guy
whom
have
you
there
my
protegee
i
told
you
of
beulah
this
is
mr
lockhart
the
rider
reined
his
horse
near
her
side
and
leaning
forward
as
he
raised
his
hat
their
eyes
met
both
started
visibly
and
extending
his
hand
lockhart
said
eagerly
ah
my
little
forest
friend
i
am
truly
glad
to
find
you
again
she
shook
hands
very
quietly
but
an
expression
of
pleasure
stole
over
her
face
her
guardian
observed
it
and
asked
pray
percy
what
do
you
know
of
her
that
she
sings
very
charmingly
answered
his
friend
smiling
at
beulah
he
saw
me
once
when
i
was
at
the
asylum
said
she
and
was
singing
part
of
the
regime
there
no
guy
she
was
wandering
about
the
piney
woods
near
the
asylum
with
two
beautiful
elves
when
i
chanced
to
meet
her
she
was
singing
at
the
time
beulah
i
am
glad
to
find
you
out
again
and
in
future
when
i
pay
the
doctor
long
visits
i
shall
expect
you
to
appear
for
my
entertainment
look
to
it
guy
that
she
is
present
but
i
am
fatigued
with
my
unusual
exercise
and
must
return
home
beulah
shake
hands
i
am
going
immediately
to
my
room
guy
so
come
as
soon
as
you
can
he
rode
slowly
on
while
hartwell
shook
the
reins
and
mazeppa
sprang
down
the
road
again
beulah
had
remarked
a
great
alteration
in
lockhart
appearance
he
was
much
paler
and
bore
traces
of
recent
and
severe
illness
his
genial
manner
and
friendly
words
had
interested
her
and
looking
up
at
her
guardian
she
said
timidly
is
he
ill
sir
he
has
been
and
is
yet
quite
feeble
do
you
like
him
i
know
nothing
of
him
except
that
he
spoke
to
me
one
evening
some
months
ago
does
he
live
here
sir
no
he
has
a
plantation
on
the
river
but
is
here
on
a
visit
occasionally
much
of
his
life
has
been
spent
in
europe
and
thither
he
goes
again
very
soon
the
sun
had
set
the
bay
seemed
a
vast
sheet
of
fire
as
the
crimson
clouds
cast
their
shifting
shadows
on
its
bosom
and
forgetting
everything
else
beulah
leaned
out
of
the
buggy
and
said
almost
unconsciously
how
beautiful
how
very
beautiful
her
lips
were
parted
her
eyes
clear
and
sparkling
with
delight
hartwell
sighed
and
turning
from
the
bay
road
approached
his
home
beulah
longed
to
speak
to
him
of
what
was
pressing
on
her
heart
but
glancing
at
his
countenance
to
see
whether
it
was
an
auspicious
time
she
was
deterred
by
the
somber
sternness
which
overshadowed
it
and
before
she
could
summon
courage
to
speak
they
stopped
at
the
front
gate
jump
out
and
go
home
i
have
not
time
to
drive
in
she
got
out
of
the
buggy
and
looking
up
at
him
as
he
rose
to
adjust
some
part
of
the
harness
said
bravely
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
my
ride
i
have
not
had
such
a
pleasure
for
years
i
thank
you
very
much
all
very
unnecessary
child
i
am
glad
you
enjoyed
it
he
seated
himself
and
gathered
up
the
reins
without
looking
at
her
but
she
put
her
hand
on
the
top
of
the
wheel
and
said
in
an
apologetic
tone
excuse
me
sir
but
may
i
wait
in
your
study
till
you
come
home
i
want
to
ask
you
something
her
face
flushed
and
her
voice
trembled
with
embarrassment
it
may
be
late
before
i
come
home
ca
you
tell
me
now
what
you
want
i
can
wait
thank
you
sir
will
do
as
well
i
suppose
i
will
not
detain
you
she
opened
the
gate
and
entered
the
yard
hartwell
looked
after
her
an
instant
and
called
out
as
he
drove
on
do
as
you
like
beulah
about
waiting
for
me
of
course
the
study
is
free
to
you
at
all
times
the
walk
or
rather
carriage
road
leading
up
to
the
house
was
bordered
by
stately
poplars
and
cedars
whose
branches
interlaced
overhead
and
formed
a
perfect
arch
beulah
looked
up
at
the
green
depths
among
the
cedars
and
walked
on
with
a
feeling
of
contentment
nay
almost
of
happiness
which
was
a
stranger
to
her
heart
in
front
of
the
house
and
in
the
center
of
a
grassy
circle
was
a
marble
basin
from
which
a
fountain
ascended
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
reservoir
and
taking
off
her
bonnet
gave
unrestrained
license
to
her
wandering
thoughts
wherever
her
eyes
turned
verdure
flowers
statuary
met
her
gaze
the
air
was
laden
with
the
spicy
fragrance
of
jasmines
and
the
low
musical
babble
of
the
fountain
had
something
very
soothing
in
its
sound
with
her
keen
appreciation
of
beauty
there
was
nothing
needed
to
enhance
her
enjoyment
and
she
ceased
to
remember
her
sorrows
before
long
however
she
was
startled
by
the
sight
of
several
elegantly
dressed
ladies
emerging
from
the
house
at
the
same
instant
a
handsome
carriage
which
she
had
not
previously
observed
drove
from
a
turn
in
the
walk
and
drew
up
to
the
door
to
receive
them
chilton
stood
on
the
steps
exchanging
smiles
and
polite
nothings
and
as
one
of
the
party
requested
permission
to
break
a
sprig
of
geranium
growing
near
she
gracefully
offered
to
collect
a
bouquet
adding
as
she
severed
some
elegant
clusters
of
heliotrope
and
jasmine
guy
takes
inordinate
pride
in
his
parterre
arranges
and
overlooks
all
the
flowers
himself
i
often
tell
him
i
am
jealous
of
my
beautiful
rivals
they
monopolize
his
leisure
so
completely
nonsense
we
know
to
our
cost
that
you
of
all
others
need
fear
rivalry
from
no
quarter
there
do
break
any
more
what
superb
taste
the
doctor
has
this
lovely
spot
comes
nearer
my
ideal
of
european
elegance
than
any
place
i
know
at
the
south
i
suppose
the
fascination
of
his
home
makes
him
such
a
recluse
why
does
he
visit
more
he
neglects
us
shamefully
he
is
such
a
favorite
in
society
too
only
i
believe
everybody
is
rather
afraid
of
him
i
shall
make
a
most
desperate
effort
to
charm
him
so
soon
as
an
opportunity
offers
do
tell
him
i
said
so
though
forearmed
all
this
was
very
volubly
uttered
by
a
dashing
showy
young
lady
dressed
in
the
extreme
of
fashion
and
bearing
unmistakable
marks
of
belonging
to
beau
monde
she
extended
a
hand
eased
in
white
kid
for
the
flowers
and
looked
steadily
at
the
lady
of
the
house
as
she
spoke
i
shall
not
betray
your
designs
miss
julia
guy
is
a
great
lover
of
the
beautiful
and
i
am
not
aware
that
anywhere
in
the
book
of
fate
is
written
the
decree
that
he
shall
not
marry
again
take
care
you
are
tearing
your
lace
point
on
that
rose
bush
let
me
disengage
it
she
stooped
to
rescue
the
cobweb
wrapping
and
looking
about
her
miss
julia
exclaimed
is
that
you
pauline
come
and
kiss
me
why
you
look
as
unsociable
as
your
uncle
sitting
there
all
alone
she
extended
her
hand
toward
beulah
who
as
may
be
supposed
made
no
attempt
to
approach
her
chilton
smiled
and
clasping
the
bracelet
on
her
arm
discovered
to
her
visitor
the
mistake
pauline
is
not
at
home
that
is
a
little
beggarly
orphan
guy
took
it
into
his
head
to
feed
and
clothe
till
some
opportunity
offered
of
placing
her
in
a
respectable
home
i
have
teased
him
unmercifully
about
this
display
of
taste
asked
him
what
rank
he
assigned
her
in
his
catalogue
of
beautiful
treasures
she
laughed
as
if
much
amused
oh
that
reminds
me
that
i
heard
some
of
the
schoolgirls
say
that
the
doctor
had
adopted
an
orphan
i
thought
i
would
ask
you
about
it
mother
here
declared
that
she
knew
it
could
not
be
so
but
i
told
her
he
was
so
very
odd
there
was
no
accounting
for
his
notions
so
he
has
not
adopted
her
pshaw
of
course
not
she
was
a
wretched
little
object
of
charity
and
guy
brought
her
here
to
keep
her
from
starving
he
picked
her
up
at
the
hospital
i
believe
i
knew
it
must
be
a
mistake
come
julia
remember
you
are
going
out
and
it
is
quite
late
do
come
very
soon
my
dear
mrs
chilton
vincent
miss
julia
and
their
companions
entered
the
carriage
and
were
soon
out
of
sight
beulah
still
sat
at
the
fountain
she
would
gladly
have
retreated
on
the
appearance
of
the
strangers
but
could
not
effect
an
escape
without
attracting
the
attention
she
so
earnestly
desired
to
be
spared
and
therefore
kept
her
seat
every
word
of
the
conversation
which
had
been
carried
on
in
anything
but
a
subdued
tone
reached
her
and
though
the
head
was
unbowed
as
if
she
had
heard
nothing
her
face
was
dyed
with
shame
her
heart
throbbed
violently
and
as
the
words
beggarly
orphan
wretched
object
of
charity
fell
on
her
ears
it
seemed
as
if
a
fierce
had
received
her
as
the
carriage
disappeared
chilton
approached
her
and
stung
to
desperation
by
the
merciless
taunts
she
instantly
rose
and
confronted
her
never
had
she
seen
the
widow
look
so
beautiful
and
for
a
moment
they
eyed
each
other
what
are
you
doing
here
after
having
been
told
to
keep
out
of
sight
answer
me
she
spoke
with
the
inflexible
sternness
of
a
mistress
to
an
offending
servant
madam
i
am
not
the
miserable
beggar
you
represented
me
a
moment
since
nor
will
i
answer
questions
addressed
in
any
such
tone
of
authority
and
contempt
indeed
well
then
my
angelic
martyr
how
do
you
propose
to
help
yourself
answered
chilton
laughing
with
undisguised
scorn
hartwell
brought
me
to
his
house
of
his
own
accord
you
know
that
i
was
scarcely
conscious
when
i
came
into
it
he
has
been
very
kind
to
me
has
offered
to
adopt
me
this
you
know
perfectly
well
but
i
am
not
in
danger
of
starvation
away
from
this
house
you
know
that
instead
of
having
been
picked
up
at
the
hospital
i
was
earning
my
living
humble
though
it
was
as
a
servant
he
offered
to
adopt
me
because
he
saw
that
i
was
very
unhappy
not
because
i
needed
food
or
clothes
as
you
asserted
just
now
and
as
you
knew
was
untrue
madam
i
have
known
ever
since
my
recovery
that
you
hated
me
and
i
scorn
to
accept
bounty
nay
even
a
shelter
where
i
am
so
unwelcome
i
have
never
dreamed
of
occupying
the
place
you
covet
for
pauline
i
intended
to
accept
hartwell
kindness
so
far
as
receiving
an
education
which
would
enable
me
to
support
myself
less
laboriously
but
madam
i
will
relieve
you
of
my
hated
presence
i
can
live
without
any
assistance
from
your
family
the
despised
and
ridiculed
orphan
will
not
remain
to
annoy
you
oh
you
might
have
effected
your
purpose
with
less
cruelty
you
could
have
told
me
kindly
that
you
did
not
want
me
here
and
i
would
not
have
wondered
at
it
but
to
crush
me
publicly
as
you
have
done
wounded
pride
stifled
the
trembling
accents
chilton
bit
her
lip
she
had
not
expected
this
expression
of
proud
independence
and
seeing
that
she
had
gone
too
far
pondered
the
best
method
of
rectifying
the
mischief
with
as
little
compromise
of
personal
dignity
as
possible
ultimately
to
eject
her
she
had
intended
from
the
first
but
perfectly
conscious
that
her
brother
would
accept
no
explanation
or
palliation
of
the
girl
departure
at
this
juncture
and
that
she
and
pauline
would
soon
follow
her
from
the
house
she
felt
that
her
own
interest
demanded
the
presence
for
a
season
nearly
blinded
by
tears
of
indignation
and
mortification
beulah
turned
from
her
but
the
delicate
white
hand
arrested
her
and
pressed
heavily
on
her
shoulder
she
drew
herself
up
and
tried
to
shake
off
the
hold
but
firm
as
iron
was
the
grasp
of
the
snowy
fingers
and
calm
and
cold
as
an
arctic
night
was
the
tone
which
said
pshaw
girl
are
you
mad
you
have
sense
enough
to
know
that
you
are
one
too
many
in
this
house
but
if
you
only
desire
to
be
educated
as
you
profess
why
i
am
perfectly
willing
that
you
should
remain
here
the
idea
of
your
growing
up
as
my
heiress
and
adopted
child
was
too
preposterous
to
be
entertained
and
you
can
see
the
absurdity
yourself
but
so
long
as
you
understand
matters
properly
and
merely
desire
to
receive
educational
advantages
of
course
you
can
and
will
remain
i
do
not
wish
this
to
go
any
further
and
as
a
sensible
girl
you
will
not
mention
it
as
a
friend
however
i
would
suggest
that
you
should
avoid
putting
yourself
in
the
way
of
observation
as
she
concluded
she
quietly
brushed
off
a
small
spider
which
was
creeping
over
beulah
sleeve
do
trouble
yourself
madam
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
poisonous
things
i
have
become
accustomed
to
them
smiling
bitterly
she
stooped
to
pick
up
her
new
bonnet
which
had
fallen
on
the
grass
at
her
feet
and
fixing
her
eyes
defiantly
on
the
handsome
face
before
her
said
resolutely
no
contemptible
as
you
think
me
beggarly
and
wretched
as
you
please
to
term
me
i
have
too
much
to
stay
a
day
longer
where
i
have
been
so
grossly
so
needlessly
insulted
you
need
not
seek
to
detain
me
take
your
hand
off
my
arm
i
am
going
now
the
sooner
the
better
i
understand
madam
your
brother
will
not
countenance
your
cruelty
and
you
are
ashamed
for
him
to
know
what
in
his
absence
you
were
not
ashamed
to
do
i
scorn
to
retaliate
he
shall
not
learn
from
me
why
i
left
so
suddenly
tell
him
what
you
choose
chilton
was
very
pale
and
her
lips
were
compressed
till
they
grew
purple
clinching
her
hand
she
said
under
her
breath
you
artful
little
wretch
am
i
to
be
thwarted
by
such
a
mere
child
you
shall
not
quit
the
house
go
to
your
room
and
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
in
future
i
shall
not
concern
myself
about
you
if
you
take
root
at
the
front
door
go
in
and
let
matters
stand
i
promise
you
i
will
not
interfere
again
no
matter
what
you
do
do
you
hear
me
no
you
have
neither
the
power
to
detain
nor
to
expel
me
i
shall
leave
here
immediately
and
you
need
not
attempt
to
coerce
me
for
if
you
do
i
will
acquaint
hartwell
with
the
whole
affair
as
soon
as
he
comes
or
when
i
see
him
i
am
going
for
my
clothes
not
those
you
so
reluctantly
had
made
but
the
old
garments
i
wore
when
i
worked
for
my
bread
she
shook
off
the
detaining
hand
and
went
up
to
her
room
harriet
had
already
lighted
her
lamp
and
as
she
entered
the
door
the
rays
fell
brightly
on
the
picture
she
had
learned
to
love
so
well
now
she
looked
at
it
through
scalding
tears
and
to
her
excited
fancy
the
smile
seemed
to
have
faded
from
the
lips
of
hope
and
the
valley
looked
more
dreary
and
the
pilgrims
more
desolate
and
miserable
she
turned
from
it
and
taking
off
the
clothes
she
wore
dressed
herself
in
the
humble
apparel
of
former
days
the
old
trunk
was
scarcely
worth
keeping
save
as
a
relic
and
folding
up
the
clothes
and
books
into
as
small
a
bundle
as
possible
she
took
it
in
her
arms
and
descended
the
steps
she
wished
very
much
to
tell
harriet
and
thank
her
for
her
unvarying
kindness
and
now
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
she
remembered
the
words
whispered
during
her
illness
and
the
offer
of
assistance
when
she
got
into
trouble
as
harriet
phrased
it
but
dreading
to
meet
chilton
again
she
hurried
down
the
hall
and
left
the
house
the
friendly
stars
looked
kindly
down
upon
the
orphan
as
she
crossed
the
common
and
proceeded
toward
the
asylum
and
raising
her
eyes
to
the
jeweled
dome
the
solemn
beauty
of
the
night
hushed
the
wild
tumult
in
her
heart
and
she
seemed
to
hear
the
words
pronounced
from
the
skyey
depths
lo
i
am
with
you
always
even
unto
the
end
gradually
the
results
of
the
step
she
had
taken
obtruded
themselves
before
her
and
with
a
keen
pang
of
pain
and
grief
came
the
thought
what
will
hartwell
think
of
me
all
his
kindness
during
the
time
she
had
passed
beneath
his
roof
his
genial
tones
his
soft
caressing
touch
on
her
head
his
rare
but
gentle
smile
his
constant
care
for
her
comfort
and
happiness
all
rushed
like
lightning
over
her
mind
and
made
the
hot
tears
gush
over
her
face
chilton
would
of
course
offer
him
some
plausible
solution
of
her
sudden
departure
he
would
think
her
ungrateful
and
grow
indifferent
to
her
welfare
or
fate
yet
hope
whispered
he
will
suspect
the
truth
he
must
know
his
nature
he
will
not
blame
me
but
all
this
was
in
the
cloudy
realm
of
conjecture
and
the
stern
realities
of
her
position
weighed
heavily
on
her
heart
through
hartwell
who
called
to
explain
her
sudden
disappearance
martin
had
sent
her
the
eighteen
dollars
due
for
three
months
service
and
this
little
sum
was
all
that
she
possessed
as
she
walked
on
pondering
the
many
difficulties
which
attended
the
darling
project
of
educating
herself
thoroughly
the
lights
of
the
asylum
greeted
her
and
it
was
with
a
painful
sense
of
desolation
that
she
mounted
the
steps
and
stood
upon
the
threshold
where
she
and
lilly
had
so
often
sat
in
years
gone
by
williams
met
her
at
the
door
wondering
what
unusual
occurrence
induced
a
visitor
at
this
unseasonable
hour
the
hall
lamp
shone
on
her
kind
but
anxious
face
and
as
beulah
looked
at
her
remembered
care
and
love
caused
a
feeling
of
suffocation
and
with
an
exclamation
of
joy
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
astonished
at
a
greeting
so
unexpected
the
matron
glanced
hurriedly
at
the
face
pressed
against
her
bosom
and
recognizing
her
quondam
charge
folded
her
tenderly
to
her
heart
beulah
dear
child
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
as
she
kissed
her
white
cheeks
beulah
felt
the
tears
dropping
down
upon
them
come
into
my
room
dear
and
take
off
your
bonnet
she
led
her
to
the
quiet
little
room
and
took
the
bundle
and
the
antiquated
bonnet
which
pauline
declared
noah
had
worn
all
through
the
forty
days
shower
williams
can
i
stay
here
with
you
until
i
can
get
a
place
somewhere
the
managers
will
not
object
will
they
no
dear
i
suppose
not
but
beulah
i
thought
you
had
been
adopted
just
after
lilly
died
by
hartwell
here
i
have
been
ever
since
i
heard
it
from
some
of
the
managers
thinking
how
lucky
it
was
for
you
and
feeling
so
thankful
to
god
for
remembering
his
orphans
child
what
has
happened
tell
me
freely
beulah
with
her
head
on
the
matron
shoulder
she
imparted
enough
of
what
had
transpired
to
explain
her
leaving
her
adopted
home
williams
shook
her
head
and
said
sadly
you
have
been
too
hasty
child
it
was
hartwell
house
he
had
taken
you
to
it
and
without
consulting
and
telling
him
you
should
not
have
left
it
if
you
felt
that
you
could
not
live
there
in
peace
with
his
sister
it
was
your
duty
to
have
told
him
so
and
then
decided
as
to
what
course
you
would
take
do
be
hurt
child
if
i
tell
you
you
are
too
proud
poverty
and
pride
make
a
bitter
lot
in
this
world
and
take
care
you
do
let
your
high
spirit
ruin
your
prospects
i
do
mean
to
say
dear
that
you
ought
to
bear
insult
and
oppression
but
i
do
think
you
owed
it
to
the
doctor
kindness
to
have
waited
until
his
return
before
you
quitted
his
house
oh
you
do
not
know
him
if
he
knew
all
that
chilton
said
and
did
he
would
turn
her
and
pauline
out
of
the
house
immediately
they
are
poor
and
but
for
him
could
not
live
without
toil
i
have
no
right
to
cause
their
ruin
she
is
his
sister
and
has
a
claim
on
him
i
have
none
she
expects
pauline
to
inherit
his
fortune
and
could
not
bear
to
think
of
his
adopting
me
i
do
wonder
at
that
so
much
but
she
need
not
have
been
so
cruel
so
insulting
i
want
his
money
or
his
house
or
his
elegant
furniture
i
only
want
an
education
and
his
advice
and
his
kind
care
for
a
few
years
i
like
pauline
very
much
indeed
she
never
treated
me
at
all
unkindly
and
i
could
not
bear
to
bring
misfortune
on
her
she
is
so
happy
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
he
will
not
hear
the
truth
of
course
and
even
if
he
did
he
will
not
suppose
you
were
actuated
by
any
such
christian
motives
to
shield
his
sister
meanness
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
first
well
it
is
all
over
now
and
i
see
i
must
help
myself
i
want
to
go
to
the
public
school
where
the
tuition
is
free
but
how
can
i
support
myself
in
the
meantime
eighteen
dollars
would
not
board
me
long
and
besides
i
shall
have
to
buy
clothes
she
looked
up
much
perplexed
in
the
matron
anxious
face
the
latter
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
said
why
the
public
school
closes
in
a
few
weeks
the
next
session
will
not
begin
before
autumn
and
what
could
you
do
until
then
no
i
will
just
inform
hartwell
of
the
truth
of
the
whole
matter
i
think
it
is
due
him
and
indeed
you
must
not
i
promised
chilton
that
i
would
not
implicate
her
and
your
doing
it
would
amount
to
the
same
thing
i
would
not
be
the
means
of
driving
pauline
out
of
her
uncle
house
for
all
the
gold
in
california
silly
child
what
on
earth
possessed
you
to
promise
any
such
thing
i
wanted
her
to
see
that
i
was
honest
in
what
i
said
she
knew
that
i
could
by
divulging
the
whole
affair
turn
her
out
of
the
house
for
hartwell
disposition
is
a
secret
to
no
one
who
has
lived
in
his
home
and
i
wished
to
show
her
that
i
told
the
truth
in
saying
i
only
wanted
to
be
educated
for
a
teacher
suppose
the
doctor
comes
here
and
asks
you
about
the
matter
i
shall
tell
him
that
i
prefer
not
being
dependent
on
anyone
but
he
will
not
come
he
does
not
know
where
i
am
yet
the
dread
that
he
would
filled
her
mind
with
new
anxieties
well
well
it
is
no
use
to
fret
over
what
ca
be
undone
i
wish
i
could
help
you
but
i
do
see
any
chance
just
now
could
not
i
get
some
plain
sewing
perhaps
the
managers
would
give
me
work
ah
beulah
it
would
soon
kill
you
to
have
to
sew
for
your
living
no
no
i
can
bear
more
than
you
think
answered
the
girl
with
a
dreary
smile
yes
your
spirit
can
endure
more
than
your
body
your
father
died
with
consumption
child
but
do
fret
about
it
any
more
come
get
some
supper
and
then
go
to
sleep
you
will
stay
in
my
room
with
me
dear
till
something
can
be
done
to
assist
you
williams
you
must
promise
me
that
you
never
will
speak
of
what
i
have
told
you
regarding
that
conversation
with
mrs
chilton
i
promise
you
dear
i
never
will
mention
it
since
you
prefer
keeping
the
matter
secret
what
will
hartwell
think
of
me
was
the
recurring
thought
that
would
not
be
banished
and
unable
to
sleep
beulah
tossed
restlessly
on
her
pillow
all
night
dreading
lest
he
should
despise
her
for
her
seeming
ingratitude
chapter
xi
for
perhaps
two
hours
after
beulah
departure
chilton
wandered
up
and
down
the
parlors
revolving
numerous
schemes
explanatory
of
her
unexpected
exodus
completely
nonplused
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
sincerely
rued
the
expression
of
dislike
and
contempt
which
had
driven
the
orphan
from
her
adopted
home
and
unable
to
decide
on
the
most
plausible
solution
to
be
offered
her
brother
she
paced
restlessly
to
and
fro
engrossed
by
no
particularly
felicitous
reflections
she
failed
to
notice
mazeppa
quick
tramp
and
remained
in
ignorance
of
the
doctor
return
until
he
entered
the
room
and
stood
beside
her
his
manner
was
hurried
his
thoughts
evidently
preoccupied
as
he
said
may
i
am
going
into
the
country
to
be
absent
all
of
tomorrow
and
possibly
longer
there
is
some
surgical
work
to
be
performed
for
a
careless
hunter
and
i
must
start
immediately
i
want
you
to
see
that
a
room
is
prepared
for
percy
lockhart
he
is
very
feeble
and
i
have
invited
him
to
come
and
stay
with
me
while
he
is
in
the
city
he
rode
out
this
evening
and
is
worse
from
the
fatigue
i
shall
expect
you
to
see
that
everything
is
provided
for
him
that
an
invalid
could
desire
can
i
depend
upon
you
certainly
i
will
exert
myself
to
render
his
stay
here
pleasant
make
yourself
easy
on
that
score
it
was
very
evident
that
the
cloud
was
rapidly
lifting
from
her
heart
and
prospects
but
she
veiled
the
sparkle
in
her
eye
and
unsuspicious
of
anything
amiss
her
brother
left
the
room
walking
up
to
one
of
the
mirrors
which
extended
from
floor
to
ceiling
she
surveyed
herself
carefully
and
a
triumphant
smile
parted
her
lips
percy
lockhart
is
vulnerable
as
well
as
other
people
and
i
have
yet
to
see
the
man
whose
heart
will
proudly
withstand
the
allurements
of
flattery
provided
the
homage
is
delicately
and
gracefully
offered
thank
heaven
years
have
touched
me
lightly
and
there
was
more
truth
than
she
relished
in
what
julia
vincent
said
about
my
beauty
this
soliloquy
was
cut
short
by
the
appearance
of
her
brother
who
carried
a
case
of
surgical
instruments
in
his
hand
may
tell
beulah
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
see
her
i
would
go
up
and
wake
her
but
have
not
time
she
wished
to
ask
me
something
tell
her
if
it
is
anything
of
importance
to
do
just
as
she
likes
i
will
see
about
it
when
i
come
home
be
sure
you
tell
her
night
take
care
of
percy
he
turned
away
but
she
exclaimed
she
is
not
here
guy
she
asked
me
this
evening
if
she
might
spend
the
night
at
the
asylum
she
thought
you
would
not
object
and
certainly
i
had
no
authority
to
prevent
her
indeed
the
parlor
was
full
of
company
and
i
told
her
she
might
go
if
she
wished
i
suppose
she
will
be
back
early
in
the
morning
his
face
darkened
instantly
and
she
felt
that
he
was
searching
her
with
his
piercing
eyes
all
this
sounds
extremely
improbable
to
me
if
she
is
not
at
home
again
at
breakfast
take
the
carriage
and
go
after
her
mind
may
i
will
sift
the
whole
matter
when
i
come
back
he
hurried
off
and
she
breathed
freely
once
more
hartwell
sprang
into
his
buggy
to
which
a
fresh
horse
had
been
attached
and
dismissing
hal
whose
weight
would
only
have
retarded
his
progress
he
drove
rapidly
off
the
gate
had
been
left
open
for
him
and
he
was
passing
through
when
arrested
by
harriet
voice
stop
master
stop
a
minute
what
do
you
want
i
ca
stop
cried
he
impatiently
are
you
going
after
that
poor
motherless
child
no
but
what
the
devil
is
to
pay
here
i
shall
get
at
the
truth
now
where
is
beulah
talk
fast
she
is
at
the
asylum
sir
i
followed
and
watched
the
poor
little
thing
master
if
you
do
listen
to
me
if
you
please
sir
you
never
will
get
at
the
truth
for
that
child
wo
tell
it
i
heard
her
promise
miss
may
she
would
not
you
would
be
ready
to
fight
if
you
knew
all
i
know
why
did
beulah
leave
here
this
evening
because
miss
may
abused
and
insulted
her
told
her
before
some
ladies
that
she
was
a
beggar
that
you
picked
up
at
the
hospital
and
that
you
thought
it
was
charity
to
feed
and
clothe
her
till
she
was
big
enough
to
work
the
ladies
were
in
the
front
yard
and
the
child
happened
to
be
sitting
by
the
fountain
she
had
just
come
from
riding
i
was
sewing
at
one
of
the
windows
upstairs
sir
and
heard
every
word
when
the
folks
were
gone
miss
may
walks
up
to
her
and
asks
her
what
she
is
doing
where
anybody
could
see
her
oh
master
if
you
could
have
seen
that
child
looks
she
fairly
seemed
to
rise
off
her
feet
and
her
face
was
as
white
as
a
corpse
she
said
she
had
wanted
an
education
that
she
knew
you
had
been
very
kind
hut
she
never
dreamed
of
taking
miss
pauline
place
in
your
house
she
said
she
would
not
stay
where
she
was
unwelcome
that
she
was
not
starving
when
you
took
her
home
that
she
knew
you
were
kind
and
good
but
that
she
scorned
them
were
the
very
words
master
she
scorned
to
stay
a
day
longer
where
she
had
been
so
insulted
oh
she
was
in
a
towering
rage
she
trembled
all
over
and
miss
may
began
to
be
scared
for
she
knew
you
would
not
suffer
such
doings
and
she
tried
to
pacify
her
and
make
up
the
quarrel
by
telling
her
she
might
stay
and
have
an
education
if
that
was
all
she
wanted
but
the
girl
would
not
hear
to
anything
she
said
and
told
her
she
need
not
be
frightened
that
she
would
go
to
you
with
the
fuss
she
would
not
tell
you
why
she
left
your
house
she
went
to
her
room
and
she
got
every
rag
of
her
old
clothes
and
left
the
house
with
the
tears
raining
out
of
her
eyes
oh
master
it
a
crying
shame
if
you
had
only
been
here
to
hear
that
child
talk
to
miss
may
good
lord
how
her
big
eyes
did
blaze
when
she
told
her
she
could
earn
a
living
by
the
pale
moonlight
she
could
see
that
her
master
face
was
rigid
as
steel
but
his
voice
was
even
calmer
than
usual
when
he
asked
are
you
sure
she
is
now
at
the
asylum
yes
sir
sure
very
well
she
is
safe
then
for
the
present
does
anyone
know
that
you
heard
the
conversation
not
a
soul
sir
except
yourself
keep
the
matter
perfectly
quiet
till
i
come
home
i
shall
be
away
a
day
or
perhaps
longer
meantime
see
that
beulah
does
not
get
out
of
your
sight
do
you
understand
me
yes
sir
i
do
the
buggy
rolled
swiftly
on
and
harriet
returned
to
the
house
by
a
circuitous
route
surmising
that
miss
may
eyes
might
detect
her
movements
the
same
night
clara
sanders
sat
on
the
doorstep
of
her
tumble
cottage
home
the
moonlight
crept
through
the
clustering
honeysuckle
and
silvered
the
piazza
floor
with
grotesque
fretwork
while
it
bathed
lovingly
the
sad
face
of
the
girlish
watcher
her
chin
rested
in
her
palms
and
the
soft
eyes
were
bent
anxiously
on
the
countenance
of
her
infirm
and
aged
companion
grandpa
do
look
so
troubled
i
am
very
sorry
too
about
the
diploma
but
if
i
am
not
to
have
it
why
there
is
no
use
in
worrying
about
it
madam
cymon
is
willing
to
employ
me
as
i
am
and
certainly
i
should
feel
grateful
for
her
preference
when
there
are
several
applicants
for
the
place
she
told
me
this
evening
that
she
thought
i
would
find
no
difficulty
in
performing
what
would
be
required
of
me
this
was
uttered
in
a
cheerful
tone
which
might
have
succeeded
very
well
had
the
sorrowful
face
been
veiled
ah
clara
you
do
dream
of
the
burden
you
are
taking
upon
yourself
the
position
of
assistant
teacher
in
an
establishment
like
madam
cymon
is
one
that
you
are
by
nature
totally
unfitted
for
child
it
will
gall
your
spirit
it
will
be
unendurable
the
old
man
sighed
heavily
still
i
have
been
educated
with
an
eye
to
teaching
and
though
i
am
now
to
occupy
a
very
subordinate
place
the
trials
will
not
be
augmented
on
the
whole
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
best
as
it
is
do
not
try
to
discourage
me
it
is
all
i
can
do
and
i
am
determined
i
will
not
despond
about
what
ca
be
helped
my
dear
child
i
did
not
mean
to
depress
you
but
you
are
so
young
to
bow
your
neck
to
such
a
yoke
how
old
are
you
he
turned
round
to
look
at
her
only
sixteen
and
a
few
months
life
is
before
me
yet
an
untrodden
plain
who
knows
but
this
narrow
path
of
duty
may
lead
to
a
calm
sweet
for
us
both
i
was
thinking
just
now
of
that
passage
from
your
favorite
wallenstein
my
soul
secure
in
the
night
only
friedland
stars
can
beam
the
darkness
has
come
down
upon
us
grandpa
let
us
wait
patiently
for
the
uprising
of
stars
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
night
there
was
silence
for
some
moments
then
the
old
man
rose
and
putting
back
the
white
locks
which
had
fallen
over
his
face
asked
in
a
subdued
tone
when
will
you
commence
your
work
sir
god
bless
you
clara
and
give
you
strength
as
he
sees
you
have
need
he
kissed
her
fondly
and
withdrew
to
his
own
room
she
sat
for
some
time
looking
vacantly
at
the
mosaic
of
light
and
shade
on
the
floor
before
her
and
striving
to
divest
her
mind
of
the
haunting
thought
that
she
was
the
victim
of
some
unyielding
necessity
whose
decree
had
gone
forth
and
might
not
be
annulled
in
early
childhood
her
home
had
been
one
of
splendid
affluence
but
reverses
came
thick
and
fast
as
misfortunes
ever
do
and
ere
she
could
realize
the
swift
transition
penury
claimed
her
family
among
its
crowding
legions
discouraged
and
embittered
her
father
made
the
the
sepulcher
of
care
and
in
a
few
months
found
a
deeper
and
far
more
quiet
grave
his
mercantile
embarrassments
had
dragged
his
to
ruin
and
too
aged
to
toil
up
the
steep
again
the
latter
resigned
himself
to
spending
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
obscurity
and
perhaps
want
to
clara
gifted
mother
he
looked
for
aid
and
comfort
in
the
clouded
evening
of
life
and
with
unceasing
energy
she
toiled
to
shield
her
father
and
her
child
from
actual
labor
thoroughly
acquainted
with
music
and
drawing
her
days
were
spent
in
giving
lessons
in
those
branches
which
had
been
acquired
with
reference
to
personal
enjoyment
alone
and
the
silent
hours
of
the
night
often
passed
in
stitching
the
garments
of
those
who
had
flocked
to
her
costly
entertainments
in
days
gone
by
when
clara
was
about
thirteen
years
of
age
a
distant
relative
chancing
to
see
her
kindly
proposed
to
contribute
the
sum
requisite
for
affording
her
every
educational
advantage
the
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
by
the
devoted
mother
and
clara
was
placed
at
madam
cymon
where
more
than
ordinary
attention
could
be
bestowed
on
the
languages
the
noble
woman
whose
heart
had
bled
incessantly
over
the
misery
ruin
and
degradation
of
her
husband
sank
slowly
under
the
intolerable
burden
of
sorrows
and
a
few
weeks
previous
to
the
evening
of
which
i
write
folded
her
weary
hands
and
went
home
to
rest
in
the
springtime
of
girlhood
clara
felt
herself
transformed
into
a
woman
standing
beside
her
mother
tomb
supporting
her
grandmother
tottering
form
she
shuddered
in
anticipating
the
dreary
future
that
beckoned
her
on
and
now
as
if
there
were
not
troubles
enough
already
to
disquiet
her
the
annual
amount
advanced
toward
her
school
expenses
was
suddenly
withdrawn
the
cousin
residing
in
a
distant
state
wrote
that
pecuniary
troubles
had
assailed
him
and
prevented
all
further
assistance
in
one
more
year
she
would
have
finished
the
prescribed
course
and
graduated
honorably
and
more
than
all
she
would
have
obtained
a
diploma
which
might
have
been
an
open
sesame
to
any
post
she
aspired
to
thus
frustrated
in
her
plans
she
gladly
accepted
the
position
of
assistant
teacher
in
the
primary
department
which
having
become
vacant
by
the
dismissal
of
the
incumbent
madam
kindly
tendered
her
the
salary
was
limited
of
course
but
nothing
else
presented
itself
and
quitting
the
desk
where
she
had
so
often
pored
over
her
she
prepared
to
grapple
with
the
trials
which
thickly
beset
the
path
of
a
young
woman
thrown
upon
her
own
resources
for
maintenance
clara
was
naturally
amiable
unselfish
and
trusting
she
was
no
intellectual
prodigy
yet
her
mind
was
clear
and
forcible
her
judgment
matured
and
above
all
her
pure
heart
warm
and
loving
notwithstanding
the
stern
realities
that
marked
her
path
there
was
a
vein
of
romance
in
her
nature
which
unfortunately
attained
more
than
healthful
development
and
while
it
often
bore
her
into
the
utopian
realms
of
fancy
it
was
still
impotent
to
modify
in
any
degree
the
social
difficulties
with
which
she
was
forced
to
contend
ah
there
is
a
touching
beauty
in
the
radiant
of
a
girl
just
crossing
the
limits
of
youth
and
commencing
her
journey
through
the
checkered
sphere
of
womanhood
it
is
all
and
morning
glory
to
her
ardent
buoyant
spirit
as
she
presses
forward
exulting
in
blissful
anticipations
but
the
withering
heat
of
the
conflict
of
life
creeps
on
the
dewdrops
exhale
the
garlands
of
hope
shattered
and
dead
strew
the
path
and
too
often
ere
noontide
the
clear
brow
and
sweet
smile
are
exchanged
for
the
weary
look
of
one
longing
for
the
evening
rest
the
twilight
the
night
oh
may
the
good
god
give
his
sleep
early
unto
these
many
there
was
a
dawning
light
in
clara
eyes
which
showed
that
though
as
yet
a
mere
girl
in
years
she
had
waked
to
the
consciousness
of
emotions
which
belong
to
womanhood
she
was
pretty
and
of
course
she
knew
it
for
i
am
skeptical
of
those
characters
who
grow
up
to
mature
beauty
all
unsuspicious
of
the
fatal
dower
and
are
some
day
startled
by
a
discovery
of
their
possessions
she
knew
too
that
female
loveliness
was
an
spell
and
depressing
as
were
the
circumstances
of
her
life
and
situation
she
felt
that
a
brighter
lot
might
be
hers
without
any
very
remarkable
or
seemingly
inconsistent
course
of
events
chapter
xii
harriet
bring
me
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
hartwell
had
returned
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
and
and
weary
threw
himself
down
on
the
sofa
in
his
study
there
was
a
pale
severity
in
his
face
which
told
that
his
reflections
during
his
brief
absence
had
been
far
from
pleasant
and
as
he
swept
back
the
hair
from
his
forehead
and
laid
his
head
on
the
cushion
the
whole
countenance
bespoke
the
bitterness
of
a
proud
but
miserable
man
he
remained
for
some
time
with
closed
eyes
and
when
the
coffee
was
served
drank
it
without
comment
harriet
busied
herself
about
the
room
doing
various
unnecessary
things
and
wondering
why
her
master
did
not
inquire
concerning
home
affairs
finally
having
exhausted
every
pretext
for
lingering
she
coughed
very
spasmodically
once
or
twice
and
putting
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
said
deferentially
do
you
want
anything
else
sir
the
bathroom
is
all
ready
has
my
sister
been
to
the
asylum
no
sir
go
and
arrange
beulah
room
she
retired
and
springing
up
he
paced
the
floor
striving
to
master
the
emotion
which
so
unwontedly
agitated
him
his
lips
writhed
and
the
thin
nostrils
expanded
but
he
paused
before
the
melodeon
sat
down
and
played
several
pieces
and
gradually
the
swollen
veins
on
his
brow
lost
their
corded
appearance
and
the
mouth
resumed
its
habitual
compression
then
with
an
exterior
as
calm
as
the
repose
of
death
he
took
his
hat
and
went
toward
the
parlor
lockhart
was
reclining
on
one
of
the
sofas
pauline
sat
on
an
ottoman
near
him
looking
over
a
book
of
prints
and
chilton
tastefully
attired
occupied
the
witching
strains
of
music
greeted
her
brother
as
he
stopped
at
the
door
and
looked
in
in
the
mirror
opposite
she
saw
his
image
reflected
and
for
an
instant
her
heart
beat
rapidly
but
the
delicate
fingers
flew
over
the
keys
as
skillfully
as
before
and
only
the
firm
setting
of
the
teeth
betokened
the
coming
struggle
he
entered
and
walking
up
to
the
invalid
said
cordially
how
are
you
percy
better
i
hope
while
one
hand
clasped
his
friend
the
other
was
laid
with
brotherly
freedom
on
the
sick
man
head
of
course
i
am
there
was
no
malady
in
eden
was
there
verily
guy
in
your
delightful
home
i
am
growing
well
again
ah
so
much
for
not
possessing
ithuriel
spear
i
am
glad
to
find
you
free
from
fever
uncle
do
you
see
me
said
pauline
reaching
up
her
hand
it
is
always
hard
to
find
you
pauline
you
are
such
a
demure
silent
little
body
said
he
shaking
her
hand
kindly
welcome
guy
i
expected
you
yesterday
what
detained
you
so
long
chilton
approached
with
outstretched
hand
and
at
the
same
time
offered
her
lips
for
a
kiss
he
availed
himself
of
neither
but
fixing
his
eyes
intently
on
hers
said
as
sweetly
as
if
he
had
been
soothing
a
fretful
child
necessity
of
course
but
now
that
i
have
come
i
shall
make
amends
i
promise
you
for
the
delay
percy
has
she
taken
good
care
of
you
she
is
an
admirable
nurse
i
can
never
requite
the
debt
she
has
imposed
is
not
my
convalescence
sufficient
proof
of
her
superior
skill
lockhart
raised
himself
and
leaning
on
his
elbow
suffered
his
eyes
to
rest
admiringly
on
the
graceful
form
and
faultless
features
beside
him
are
you
really
so
much
better
said
hartwell
gnawing
his
lip
indeed
i
am
why
are
you
so
incredulous
have
you
so
little
confidence
in
your
own
prescriptions
confidence
i
had
little
enough
when
given
immeasurably
less
now
but
we
will
talk
of
all
this
after
a
little
i
have
some
matters
to
arrange
and
will
be
with
you
at
tea
may
i
wish
to
see
you
well
guy
what
is
it
without
moving
an
inch
she
looked
up
at
him
come
to
my
study
answered
her
brother
quietly
and
leave
your
patient
to
amuse
himself
really
guy
you
exercise
the
rites
of
hospitality
so
rarely
that
you
forget
the
ordinary
requirements
apropos
your
little
protegee
has
not
returned
it
seems
she
did
not
fancy
living
here
and
prefers
staying
at
the
asylum
i
would
not
trouble
myself
about
her
if
i
were
you
some
people
can
not
appreciate
kindness
you
know
she
uttered
this
piece
of
counsel
with
perfect
sangfroid
and
met
her
brother
eye
as
innocently
as
pauline
would
have
done
i
am
thoroughly
acquainted
with
her
objections
to
this
place
and
determined
to
remove
them
so
completely
that
she
can
not
refused
to
return
a
gray
pallor
crept
over
his
sister
face
but
she
replied
with
her
usual
equanimity
you
have
seen
her
then
i
thought
you
had
hurried
back
to
your
sick
friend
here
without
pausing
by
the
way
no
i
have
not
seen
her
and
you
are
aware
her
voluntary
promise
would
seal
her
lips
even
if
i
had
he
smiled
contemptuously
as
he
saw
her
puzzled
look
and
continued
percy
will
excuse
you
for
a
few
moments
come
with
me
pauline
entertain
this
gentleman
in
our
absence
she
took
his
offered
arm
and
they
proceeded
to
the
study
in
silence
sit
down
hartwell
pushed
a
chair
toward
her
and
stood
looking
her
fully
in
the
face
she
did
not
shrink
and
asked
unconcernedly
well
guy
to
what
does
all
this
preamble
lead
may
is
the
doctrine
of
future
punishments
laid
down
as
orthodox
in
that
elegantly
gilded
you
take
with
you
in
your
weekly
pilgrimages
to
church
come
come
guy
if
you
have
no
respect
for
religion
yourself
do
scoff
at
its
observances
in
my
presence
it
is
very
unkind
and
i
will
not
allow
it
she
rose
with
an
air
of
offended
dignity
scoff
you
wrong
me
why
verily
your
religion
is
too
formidable
to
suffer
the
thought
i
tell
you
sister
mine
your
creed
is
a
terrible
one
in
my
eyes
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
of
withering
scorn
she
grew
restless
under
his
impaling
gaze
and
he
continued
mockingly
from
such
creeds
such
practice
good
lord
deliver
us
she
turned
to
go
but
his
hand
fell
heavily
on
her
shoulder
i
am
acquainted
with
all
that
passed
between
beulah
and
yourself
the
evening
she
left
my
house
i
was
cognizant
of
the
whole
truth
before
i
left
the
city
artful
wretch
she
is
as
false
as
contemptible
muttered
the
sister
through
set
teeth
take
care
do
not
too
hastily
apply
your
own
individual
standard
of
action
to
others
she
does
not
dream
that
i
am
acquainted
with
the
truth
though
doubtless
she
wonders
that
knowing
you
so
well
i
should
not
suspect
it
ah
guided
by
your
favorite
mephistopheles
you
wrapped
the
mantle
of
invisibility
about
you
and
heard
it
all
eh
no
mephistopheles
is
not
ubiquitous
and
i
left
him
at
home
here
it
seems
when
i
took
that
child
to
ride
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
believe
you
are
my
sister
very
difficult
it
is
the
most
humiliating
thought
that
could
possibly
be
suggested
to
me
may
i
very
nearly
decided
to
send
you
and
pauline
out
into
the
world
without
a
dime
without
a
cent
just
as
i
found
you
and
i
may
do
so
yet
you
dare
not
you
dare
not
you
swore
a
solemn
oath
to
the
dying
that
you
would
always
provide
for
us
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
breaking
your
vow
cried
chilton
leaning
heavily
against
the
table
to
support
herself
you
give
me
credit
for
too
much
nicety
i
tell
you
i
would
break
my
oath
nay
for
your
duplicity
cancels
it
but
for
that
orphan
you
hate
so
cordially
she
would
never
return
if
you
and
pauline
suffered
for
the
past
for
her
sake
and
hers
only
i
will
still
assist
support
you
for
have
her
here
i
will
if
it
cost
me
life
and
fortune
i
would
send
you
off
to
the
plantation
but
there
are
no
educational
advantages
there
for
pauline
and
therefore
if
beulah
returns
i
have
resolved
to
buy
and
give
you
a
separate
home
wherever
you
may
prefer
stay
here
you
can
not
and
shall
not
and
what
construction
will
the
world
place
on
your
taking
a
young
girl
into
your
house
at
the
time
that
i
leave
it
guy
with
what
marvelous
foresight
you
are
endowed
said
she
laughing
sardonically
i
shall
take
measures
to
prevent
any
improper
construction
watson
the
widow
of
one
of
my
oldest
and
best
friends
has
been
left
in
destitute
circumstances
and
i
shall
immediately
offer
her
a
home
here
to
take
charge
of
my
household
and
look
after
beulah
when
i
am
absent
she
is
an
estimable
woman
past
fifty
years
of
age
and
her
character
is
so
irreproachable
that
her
presence
here
will
obviate
the
objection
you
have
urged
you
will
decide
where
you
wish
to
fix
your
future
residence
and
let
me
know
i
shall
not
give
you
longer
time
for
a
decision
meantime
when
beulah
returns
you
will
not
allude
to
the
matter
at
your
peril
may
i
have
borne
much
from
you
but
by
all
that
i
prize
i
swear
i
will
make
you
suffer
severely
if
you
dare
to
interfere
again
do
not
imagine
that
i
am
ignorant
of
your
schemes
i
tell
you
now
i
would
gladly
see
percy
lockhart
lowered
into
the
grave
rather
than
know
that
you
had
succeeded
in
blinding
him
oh
his
noble
nature
would
loathe
you
could
he
see
you
as
you
are
there
go
or
i
shall
forget
that
i
am
talking
to
a
woman
much
less
a
woman
claiming
to
be
my
sister
go
go
he
put
up
his
hands
as
if
unwilling
to
look
at
her
and
leaving
the
room
descended
to
the
front
door
a
large
family
carriage
drawn
by
two
horses
stood
in
readiness
and
seating
himself
within
it
he
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
to
the
asylum
williams
met
him
at
the
entrance
and
despite
her
assumed
composure
felt
nervous
and
uncomfortable
for
his
scrutinizing
look
disconcerted
her
madam
you
are
the
matron
of
this
institution
i
presume
i
want
to
see
beulah
benton
sir
she
saw
your
carriage
and
desired
me
to
say
to
you
that
though
she
was
very
grateful
for
your
kindness
she
did
not
wish
to
burden
you
and
preferred
remaining
here
until
she
could
find
some
position
which
would
enable
her
to
support
herself
she
begs
you
will
not
insist
upon
seeing
her
she
does
not
wish
to
see
you
where
is
she
i
shall
not
leave
the
house
until
i
do
see
her
she
saw
from
his
countenance
that
it
was
useless
to
contend
there
was
an
unbending
look
of
resolve
which
said
plainly
tell
me
where
to
find
her
or
i
shall
search
for
her
at
once
secretly
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
reconciliation
the
matron
no
longer
hesitated
and
pointing
to
the
staircase
said
she
is
in
the
first
room
he
mounted
the
steps
opened
the
door
and
entered
beulah
was
standing
by
the
window
she
had
recognized
his
step
and
knew
that
he
was
in
the
room
but
felt
as
if
she
would
not
meet
his
eye
for
the
universe
yet
there
was
in
her
heart
an
intense
longing
to
see
him
again
during
the
two
past
days
she
had
missed
his
kind
manner
and
grave
watchfulness
and
now
if
she
had
dared
to
yield
to
the
impulse
that
prompted
she
would
have
sprung
to
meet
him
and
caught
his
hand
to
her
lips
he
approached
and
stood
looking
at
the
drooped
face
then
his
soft
cool
touch
was
on
her
head
and
he
said
in
his
peculiar
low
musical
tones
proud
little
spirit
come
home
and
be
happy
she
shook
her
head
saying
resolutely
i
can
not
i
have
no
home
i
could
not
be
happy
in
your
house

can
be
in
future

know
the
whole
truth
of
this
matter

i
discovered

is
no
concern
of
yours

have
not
broken
your
promise
now

make
your
return
to
my
house

condition
of
my
sister

am
not
trifling
if
you
persist
in
leaving
me
i
tell
you
solemnly
i
will
send
her
and
pauline
out
into
the
world
to
work
for
their
daily
bread
as

you
will
come

will
give
them
a
comfortable
home
of
their
own
wherever
they
may
prefer
to
live
and

that
they
are
always
well
cared
for
but
they
shall
not
remain
in
my
house
whether
you
come
or
not
i
am
in
earnest

at
me
you

i
never
say
what
i
do
not
mean
i
want
you
to
come
back
i
ask
you
to
come
with
me
now
i
am
lonely
my
home
is
dark
and
desolate
come
my
child
come
he
held
her
hands
in
his
and
drew
her
gently
toward
him
she
looked
eagerly
into
his
face
and
as
she
noted
the
stern
sadness
that
marred
its
noble
beauty
the
words
of
his
sister
flashed
upon
her
memory
he
had
been
married
was
it
the
loss
of
his
wife
that
had
so
darkened
his
elegant
home
that
gave
such
austerity
to
the
comparatively
youthful
face
she
gazed
into
the
deep
eyes
till
she
grew
dizzy
and
answered
indistinctly
i
have
no
claim
on
you
will
not
be
the
means
of
parting
you
and
your
sister
you
have
pauline
make
her
your
child
henceforth
my
sister
and
myself
are
parted
whether
you
will
it
or
not
whether
you
come
back
or
otherwise
once
for
all
if
you
would
serve
her
come
for
on
this
condition
only
will
i
provide
for
her
pauline
does
not
suit
me
you
do
i
can
make
you
a
friend
in
some
sort
a
companion
beulah
you
want
to
come
to
me
i
see
it
in
your
eyes
but
i
see
too
that
you
want
conditions
what
are
they
will
you
always
treat
pauline
just
as
kindly
as
if
you
had
never
taken
me
to
your
house
except
having
a
separate
home
she
shall
never
know
any
difference
i
promise
you
this
what
else
will
you
let
me
go
to
the
public
school
instead
of
madam
st
cymon
why
pray
because
the
tuition
is
free
and
you
are
too
proud
to
accept
any
aid
from
me
no
sir
i
want
your
counsel
and
guidance
and
i
want
to
be
with
you
to
show
you
that
i
do
thank
you
for
all
your
goodness
but
i
want
to
cost
you
as
little
as
possible
you
do
not
expect
to
depend
on
me
always
then
said
he
smiling
despite
himself
no
sir
only
till
i
am
able
to
teach
if
you
are
willing
to
do
this
i
shall
be
glad
to
go
back
very
glad
but
not
unless
you
are
she
looked
as
firm
as
her
guardian
better
stipulate
also
that
you
are
to
wear
nothing
more
expensive
than
bit
calico
he
seemed
much
amused
indeed
sir
i
am
not
jesting
at
all
if
you
will
take
care
of
me
while
i
am
educating
myself
i
shall
be
very
grateful
to
you
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
adopted
very
well
then
i
will
try
to
take
care
of
you
i
have
signed
your
treaty
are
you
ready
to
come
home
yes
sir
glad
to
come
her
fingers
closed
confidingly
over
his
and
they
joined
williams
in
the
hall
below
a
brief
explanation
from
beulah
sufficed
for
the
rejoicing
matron
and
soon
she
was
borne
rapidly
from
the
asylum
hartwell
was
silent
until
they
reached
home
and
beulah
was
going
to
her
own
room
when
he
asked
suddenly
what
was
it
that
you
wished
to
ask
me
about
the
evening
of
the
ride
that
i
might
go
to
the
public
school
what
put
that
into
your
head
as
an
independent
orphan
i
am
insulted
at
madam
st
cymon
by
whom
his
eyes
flashed
no
matter
now
sir
by
whom
i
ask
you
not
by
pauline
she
would
scorn
to
be
guilty
of
anything
so
ungenerous
you
do
not
mean
to
answer
my
question
then
no
sir
do
not
ask
me
to
do
so
for
i
can
not
very
well
get
ready
for
tea
lockhart
is
here
one
word
more
you
need
fear
no
further
interference
from
anyone
he
walked
on
and
glad
to
be
released
beulah
hastened
to
her
own
room
with
a
strange
feeling
of
joy
on
entering
it
again
harriet
welcomed
her
warmly
and
without
alluding
to
her
absence
assisted
in
braiding
the
heavy
masses
of
hair
which
required
arranging
half
an
hour
after
hartwell
knocked
at
the
door
and
conducted
her
downstairs
chilton
rose
and
extended
her
hand
with
an
amicable
expression
of
countenance
for
which
beulah
was
not
prepared
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
accept
the
hand
but
her
salutation
was
gravely
polite
mrs
chilton
lockhart
made
room
for
her
on
the
sofa
and
quietly
ensconced
in
one
corner
she
sat
for
some
time
so
engaged
in
listening
to
the
general
conversation
that
the
bitter
recollection
of
trials
was
entirely
banished
hartwell
and
his
friend
were
talking
of
europe
and
the
latter
after
recounting
much
of
interest
in
connection
with
his
former
visits
said
earnestly
go
with
me
this
time
guy
one
tour
can
not
have
satiated
you
it
will
be
double
nay
triple
enjoyment
to
have
you
along
it
is
and
always
has
been
a
mystery
to
me
why
you
should
persist
in
practicing
you
do
not
need
the
pecuniary
aid
your
income
would
enable
you
to
live
just
as
you
pleased
life
is
short
at
best
why
not
glean
all
of
pleasure
that
travel
affords
to
a
nature
like
yours
your
sister
was
just
telling
me
that
in
a
few
days
she
goes
north
to
place
pauline
at
some
celebrated
school
and
without
her
you
will
be
desolate
come
let
to
europe
together
what
do
you
say
hartwell
received
this
intimation
of
his
sister
plans
without
the
slightest
token
of
surprise
and
smiled
sarcastically
as
he
replied
percy
i
shall
answer
you
in
the
words
of
a
favorite
author
of
the
day
he
says
is
for
want
of
that
the
superstition
of
traveling
whose
idols
are
italy
england
egypt
retains
its
fascination
for
all
educated
americans
he
who
travels
to
be
amused
or
to
get
somewhat
which
he
does
not
carry
travels
away
from
himself
and
grows
old
even
in
youth
among
old
things
in
thebes
in
palmyra
his
will
and
mind
have
become
old
and
dilapidated
as
they
he
carries
ruins
to
ruins
traveling
is
a
fool
paradise
at
home
i
dream
that
at
naples
at
rome
i
can
be
intoxicated
with
beauty
and
lose
my
sadness
i
pack
my
trunk
embark
and
finally
wake
up
in
naples
and
there
beside
me
is
the
stern
fact
the
sad
self
unrelenting
identical
that
i
fled
from
i
affect
to
be
intoxicated
with
sights
and
suggestions
but
i
am
not
my
giant
goes
with
me
wherever
i
go
percy
i
endeavored
to
drown
my
giant
in
the
mediterranean
to
bury
it
forever
beneath
the
green
waters
of
lago
maggiore
to
hurl
it
from
solemn
icy
alpine
heights
to
dodge
it
in
museums
of
art
but
as
emerson
says
it
clung
to
me
with
unerring
allegiance
and
i
came
home
and
now
daily
and
yearly
i
repeat
the
hopeless
experiment
in
my
round
of
professional
duties
yes
may
and
pauline
are
going
away
but
i
shall
have
beulah
to
look
after
and
i
fancy
time
will
not
drag
its
wheels
through
coming
years
how
soon
do
you
think
of
leaving
america
i
have
some
commissions
for
you
when
you
start
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
go
north
within
a
fortnight
and
after
a
short
visit
to
newport
or
saratoga
sail
for
havre
what
do
you
want
from
the
great
storehouse
of
art
sculpture
and
paintings
cameos
and
prints
i
will
furnish
you
with
a
catalogue
do
you
go
through
germany
or
only
flaunt
under
the
sunny
skies
of
the
levant
i
have
as
yet
no
settled
plans
but
probably
before
i
return
shall
explore
egypt
syria
and
arabia
do
you
want
anything
from
the
dying
world
from
dendera
carnac
or
that
city
of
rock
lonely
silent
awful
petra
not
i
the
flavor
of
sodom
is
too
prevalent
but
there
are
a
few
localities
that
i
shall
ask
you
to
sketch
for
me
subsequently
lockhart
requested
beulah
to
sing
her
forest
song
for
him
again
the
blood
surged
quickly
into
her
face
and
not
without
confusion
she
begged
him
to
excuse
her
he
insisted
and
tried
to
draw
her
from
her
seat
but
sinking
further
back
into
the
corner
she
assured
him
she
could
not
she
never
sang
except
when
alone
hartwell
smiled
and
looking
at
her
curiously
said
i
never
heard
her
even
attempt
to
sing
beulah
why
will
you
not
try
to
oblige
him
oh
sir
my
songs
are
all
connected
with
sorrows
i
could
not
sing
them
now
indeed
i
could
not
and
as
the
memory
of
lilly
hushed
by
her
lullaby
rose
vividly
before
her
she
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
wept
quietly
when
you
come
home
from
your
oriental
jaunt
she
will
be
able
to
comply
with
your
request
meantime
percy
come
into
the
study
i
want
a
cigar
and
game
of
chess
beulah
quitted
the
parlor
at
the
same
time
and
was
mounting
the
steps
when
she
heard
lockhart
ask
guy
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
child
going
to
try
to
show
her
that
the
world
is
not
altogether
made
up
of
brutes
she
heard
no
more
but
long
after
she
laid
her
head
upon
the
pillow
pondered
on
the
kind
fate
which
gave
her
so
considerate
so
generous
a
guardian
and
in
the
depths
of
her
gratitude
she
vowed
to
show
him
that
she
reverenced
and
honored
him
chapter
xiii
three
years
passed
swiftly
unmarked
by
any
incidents
of
interest
and
one
dreary
night
in
december
beulah
sat
in
hartwell
study
wondering
what
detained
him
so
much
later
than
usual
the
lamp
stood
on
the
and
the
urn
awaited
the
master
return
the
room
with
its
books
statues
paintings
and
melodeon
was
unaltered
but
time
had
materially
changed
the
appearance
of
the
orphan
she
had
grown
tall
and
the
mazarine
blue
merino
dress
fitted
the
slender
form
with
scrupulous
exactness
the
luxuriant
black
hair
was
combed
straight
back
from
the
face
and
wound
into
a
circular
knot
which
covered
the
entire
back
of
the
head
and
gave
a
classical
outline
to
the
whole
the
eyelashes
were
longer
and
darker
the
complexion
had
lost
its
sickly
hue
and
though
there
was
no
bloom
on
the
cheeks
they
were
clear
and
white
i
have
spoken
before
of
the
singular
conformation
of
the
massive
brow
and
now
the
style
in
which
she
wore
her
hair
fully
exposed
the
outline
the
large
gray
eyes
had
lost
their
look
of
bitterness
but
more
than
ever
they
were
grave
earnest
restless
and
searching
indexing
a
stormy
soul
the
whole
countenance
betokened
that
rare
combination
of
mental
endowments
that
habitual
train
of
deep
concentrated
thought
mingled
with
somewhat
dark
passion
which
characterizes
the
eagerly
inquiring
mind
that
struggles
to
lift
itself
far
above
common
utilitarian
themes
the
placid
element
was
as
wanting
in
her
physiognomy
as
in
her
character
and
even
the
lines
of
the
mouth
gave
evidence
of
strength
and
restlessness
rather
than
peace
before
her
lay
a
book
on
geometry
and
engrossed
by
study
she
was
unobservant
of
hartwell
entrance
walking
up
to
the
grate
he
warmed
his
fingers
and
then
with
his
hands
behind
him
stood
still
on
the
rug
regarding
his
protegee
attentively
he
looked
precisely
as
he
had
done
more
than
three
years
before
when
he
waited
at
martin
watching
little
johnny
and
his
nurse
the
colorless
face
seemed
as
if
chiseled
out
of
ivory
and
stern
gravity
blended
with
bitterness
was
enthroned
on
the
lofty
unfurrowed
brow
he
looked
at
the
girl
intently
as
he
would
have
watched
a
patient
to
whom
he
had
administered
a
dubious
medicine
and
felt
some
curiosity
concerning
the
result
beulah
put
up
your
book
and
make
the
tea
will
you
she
started
up
and
seating
herself
before
the
urn
said
joyfully
i
did
not
know
you
had
come
home
you
look
cold
sir
yes
it
is
deucedly
cold
and
to
mend
the
matter
mazeppa
must
needs
slip
on
the
ice
in
the
gutter
and
lame
himself
knew
too
i
should
want
him
again
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
and
received
his
tea
from
her
hand
for
it
was
one
of
his
whims
to
dismiss
watson
and
the
servants
at
this
meal
and
have
only
beulah
present
who
is
so
ill
as
to
require
a
second
visit
she
very
rarely
asked
anything
relative
to
his
professional
engagements
but
saw
that
he
was
more
than
usually
interested
why
that
quiet
little
quaker
friend
of
yours
clara
sanders
will
probably
lose
her
grandfather
this
time
he
had
a
second
paralytic
stroke
and
i
doubt
whether
he
survives
till
morning
are
any
of
clara
friends
with
her
asked
beulah
quickly
some
two
or
three
of
the
neighbors
what
now
he
continued
as
she
rose
from
the
table
i
am
going
to
get
ready
and
go
with
you
when
you
return
nonsense
the
weather
is
too
disagreeable
and
besides
you
can
do
no
good
the
old
man
is
unconscious
do
think
of
it
but
i
must
think
of
it
and
what
is
more
you
must
carry
me
if
you
please
i
shall
not
mind
the
cold
and
i
know
clara
would
rather
have
me
with
her
even
though
i
could
render
no
assistance
will
you
carry
me
i
shall
thank
you
very
much
she
stood
on
the
threshold
and
if
i
will
not
carry
you
he
answered
questioningly
then
sir
though
sorry
to
disobey
you
i
shall
be
forced
to
walk
there
so
i
supposed
you
may
get
ready
thank
you
she
hurried
off
to
wrap
up
for
the
ride
and
acquaint
watson
with
the
cause
of
her
temporary
absence
on
the
study
she
found
the
doctor
lying
on
the
sofa
with
one
hand
over
his
eyes
without
removing
it
he
tossed
a
letter
to
her
saying
there
is
a
letter
from
heidelberg
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
you
will
have
time
to
read
it
the
buggy
is
not
ready
he
moved
his
fingers
slightly
so
as
to
see
her
distinctly
while
she
tore
off
the
envelope
and
perused
it
at
first
she
looked
pleased
then
the
black
eyebrows
met
over
the
nose
and
as
she
refolded
it
there
was
a
very
decided
curl
in
the
compressed
upper
lip
she
put
it
into
her
pocket
without
comment
eugene
is
well
i
suppose
said
the
doctor
still
shading
his
eyes
yes
sir
quite
well
does
he
seem
to
be
improving
his
advantages
i
should
judge
not
from
the
tone
of
this
letter
what
does
it
indicate
that
he
thinks
of
settling
down
into
mercantile
life
on
his
return
as
if
he
needed
to
go
to
germany
to
learn
to
keep
books
she
spoke
hastily
and
with
much
chagrin
and
why
not
germany
is
par
excellence
the
land
of
and
why
not
of
bookkeeping
german
proficiency
is
not
the
question
sir
hartwell
smiled
and
passing
his
fingers
through
his
hair
replied
you
intend
to
annihilate
that
plebeian
project
of
his
then
his
own
will
must
govern
him
sir
over
that
i
have
no
power
still
you
will
use
your
influence
in
favor
of
a
learned
profession
yes
sir
if
i
have
any
take
care
your
ambitious
pride
does
not
ruin
you
both
there
is
the
buggy
be
so
good
as
to
give
me
my
fur
gauntlets
out
of
the
drawer
of
my
desk
that
will
do
come
the
ride
was
rather
silent
beulah
spoke
several
times
but
was
answered
in
a
manner
which
informed
her
that
her
guardian
was
in
a
gloomy
mood
and
did
not
choose
to
talk
he
was
to
her
as
inexplicable
as
ever
she
felt
that
the
barrier
which
divided
them
instead
of
melting
away
with
long
and
intimate
acquaintance
had
strengthened
and
grown
impenetrable
kind
but
taciturn
she
knew
little
of
his
opinions
on
any
of
the
great
questions
which
began
to
agitate
her
own
mind
for
rather
more
than
three
years
they
had
spent
their
evenings
together
she
in
studying
he
in
reading
or
writing
of
his
past
life
she
knew
absolutely
nothing
for
no
unguarded
allusion
to
it
ever
escaped
his
lips
as
long
as
she
had
lived
in
his
house
he
had
never
mentioned
his
wife
name
and
but
for
his
sister
words
she
would
have
been
utterly
ignorant
of
his
marriage
whether
the
omission
was
studied
or
merely
the
result
of
abstraction
she
could
only
surmise
once
when
sitting
around
the
fire
a
piece
of
crape
fell
upon
the
hearth
from
the
shrouded
portrait
he
stooped
down
picked
it
up
and
without
glancing
at
the
picture
threw
the
fragment
into
the
grate
she
longed
to
see
the
covered
face
but
dared
not
unfasten
the
sable
folds
which
had
grown
rusty
with
age
sometimes
she
fancied
her
presence
annoyed
him
but
if
she
absented
herself
at
all
during
the
evening
he
invariably
inquired
the
cause
he
had
most
scrupulously
avoided
all
reference
to
matters
of
faith
she
had
endeavored
several
times
to
direct
the
conversation
to
religious
topics
but
he
adroitly
eluded
her
efforts
and
abstained
from
any
such
discussion
and
though
on
sabbath
she
generally
accompanied
watson
to
church
he
never
alluded
to
it
occasionally
when
more
than
ordinarily
fatigued
by
the
labors
of
the
day
he
had
permitted
her
to
read
aloud
to
him
from
some
of
his
favorite
volumes
and
these
brief
glimpses
had
given
her
an
intense
longing
to
pursue
the
same
paths
of
investigation
she
revered
and
admired
him
nay
she
loved
him
but
it
was
more
earnest
gratitude
than
genuine
affection
love
casteth
out
fear
and
most
certainly
she
feared
him
she
had
entered
her
seventeenth
year
and
feeling
that
she
was
no
longer
a
child
her
pride
sometimes
rebelled
at
the
calm
commanding
manner
he
maintained
toward
her
they
found
clara
kneeling
beside
her
insensible
grandfather
while
two
or
three
ladies
sat
near
the
hearth
talking
in
undertones
beulah
put
her
arms
tenderly
around
her
friend
ere
she
was
aware
of
her
presence
and
the
cry
of
blended
woe
and
gladness
with
which
clara
threw
herself
on
beulah
bosom
told
her
how
timed
that
presence
was
three
years
of
teaching
and
care
had
worn
the
slight
young
form
and
given
a
troubled
strained
weary
look
to
the
fair
face
thin
pale
and
tearful
she
clung
to
beulah
and
asked
in
broken
accents
what
would
become
of
her
when
the
aged
sleeper
was
no
more
our
good
god
remains
to
you
clara
i
was
a
shorn
lamb
and
he
tempered
the
winds
for
me
i
was
very
miserable
but
he
did
not
forsake
me
clara
looked
at
the
tall
form
of
the
physician
and
while
her
eyes
rested
upon
him
with
a
species
of
fascination
she
murmured
yes
you
have
been
blessed
indeed
you
have
him
he
guards
and
cares
for
your
happiness
but
i
oh
i
am
alone
you
told
me
he
had
promised
to
be
your
friend
best
assured
he
will
prove
himself
such
answered
beulah
watching
clara
countenance
as
she
spoke
yes
i
know
but
she
paused
and
averted
her
head
for
just
then
he
drew
near
and
said
gravely
beulah
take
miss
clara
to
her
own
room
and
persuade
her
to
rest
i
shall
remain
probably
all
night
at
least
until
some
change
takes
place
do
send
me
away
pleaded
clara
mournfully
go
beulah
it
is
for
her
own
good
she
saw
that
he
was
unrelenting
and
complied
without
opposition
in
the
seclusion
of
her
room
she
indulged
in
a
passionate
burst
of
grief
and
thinking
it
was
best
thus
vented
beulah
paced
up
and
down
the
floor
listening
now
to
the
convulsive
sobs
and
now
to
the
rain
which
pelted
the
she
was
two
years
younger
than
her
companion
yet
felt
that
she
was
immeasurably
stronger
often
during
their
acquaintance
a
painful
suspicion
had
crossed
her
mind
as
often
she
had
banished
it
but
now
it
haunted
her
with
a
pertinacity
which
she
could
not
subdue
while
her
feet
trod
the
chamber
floor
memory
trod
the
chambers
of
the
past
and
gathered
up
every
link
which
could
strengthen
the
chain
of
evidence
gradually
dim
conjecture
became
sad
conviction
and
she
was
conscious
of
a
degree
of
pain
and
sorrow
for
which
she
could
not
readily
account
if
clara
loved
hartwell
why
should
it
grieve
her
her
step
grew
nervously
rapid
and
the
eyes
settled
upon
the
carpet
with
a
fixedness
of
which
she
was
unconscious
suppose
he
was
double
her
age
if
clara
loved
him
notwithstanding
what
business
was
it
of
hers
besides
no
one
would
dream
of
the
actual
disparity
in
years
for
he
was
a
very
handsome
man
and
certainly
did
not
look
more
than
ten
years
older
true
clara
was
not
very
intellectual
and
he
was
particularly
fond
of
literary
pursuits
but
had
not
she
heard
him
say
that
it
was
a
singular
fact
in
anthropology
that
men
selected
their
opposites
for
wives
she
did
not
believe
her
guardian
ever
thought
of
clara
save
when
in
her
presence
but
how
did
she
know
anything
about
his
thoughts
and
fancies
his
likes
and
dislikes
he
had
never
even
spoken
of
his
marriage
was
it
probable
that
the
subject
of
a
second
love
would
have
escaped
him
all
this
passed
rapidly
in
her
mind
and
when
clara
called
her
to
sit
down
on
the
couch
beside
her
she
started
as
from
a
painful
dream
while
her
friend
talked
sadly
of
the
future
beulah
analyzed
her
features
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
a
very
easy
matter
to
love
her
the
face
was
so
sweet
and
gentle
the
manner
so
graceful
the
tone
so
musical
and
winning
absorbed
in
thought
neither
noted
the
lapse
of
time
midnight
passed
two
came
and
then
at
three
a
knock
startled
the
watchers
clara
sprang
to
the
door
hartwell
pointed
to
the
sickroom
and
said
gently
he
has
ceased
to
suffer
he
is
at
rest
she
looked
at
him
vacantly
an
instant
and
whispered
under
her
breath
he
is
not
dead
he
did
not
reply
and
with
a
frightened
expression
she
glided
into
the
chamber
of
death
calling
piteously
on
the
sleeper
to
come
back
and
shield
her
beulah
would
have
followed
but
the
doctor
detained
her
not
yet
child
not
yet
as
if
unconscious
of
the
act
he
passed
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
and
drew
her
close
to
him
she
looked
up
in
astonishment
but
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
kneeling
figure
in
the
room
opposite
and
she
saw
that
just
then
he
was
thinking
of
anything
else
than
her
presence
are
you
going
home
now
sir
yes
but
you
must
stay
with
that
poor
girl
yonder
ca
you
prevail
on
her
to
come
and
spend
a
few
days
with
you
i
rather
think
not
answered
beulah
resolved
not
to
try
you
look
pale
my
child
watching
is
not
good
for
you
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
have
seen
death
strange
that
people
will
not
see
it
as
it
is
passing
strange
what
do
you
mean
said
she
striving
to
interpret
the
smile
that
wreathed
his
lips
you
will
not
believe
if
i
tell
you
is
but
the
germ
of
death
and
death
the
development
of
a
higher
life
higher
in
the
sense
of
heavenly
immortality
you
may
call
it
heavenly
if
you
choose
stay
here
till
the
funeral
is
over
and
i
will
send
for
you
are
you
worn
out
child
he
had
withdrawn
his
arm
and
now
looked
anxiously
at
her
colorless
face
no
sir
then
why
are
you
so
very
pale
did
you
ever
see
me
sir
when
i
was
anything
else
i
have
seen
you
look
less
ghostly
he
left
the
house
without
even
shaking
hands
the
day
which
succeeded
was
very
gloomy
and
after
the
funeral
rites
had
been
performed
and
the
second
day
looked
in
heart
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
returning
home
clara
shrank
from
the
thought
of
being
left
alone
the
little
cottage
was
so
desolate
she
would
give
it
up
now
of
course
and
find
a
cheap
boarding
house
but
the
furniture
must
be
rubbed
and
sent
down
to
an
auction
room
and
she
dreaded
the
separation
from
all
the
objects
which
linked
her
with
the
past
clara
i
have
been
commissioned
to
invite
you
to
spend
several
days
with
me
until
you
can
select
a
boarding
house
hartwell
will
be
glad
to
have
you
come
did
he
say
so
asked
the
mourner
shading
her
face
with
her
hand
he
told
me
i
must
bring
you
home
with
me
answered
beulah
oh
how
good
how
noble
he
is
beulah
you
are
lucky
lucky
indeed
she
dropped
her
head
on
her
arms
clara
i
believe
there
is
less
difference
in
our
positions
than
you
seem
to
imagine
we
are
both
orphans
and
in
about
a
year
i
too
shall
be
a
teacher
hartwell
is
my
guardian
and
protector
but
he
will
be
a
kind
friend
to
you
also
beulah
you
are
mad
to
dream
of
leaving
him
and
turning
teacher
i
am
older
than
you
and
have
traveled
over
the
very
track
that
you
are
so
eager
to
set
out
upon
oh
take
my
advice
stay
where
you
are
would
you
leave
summer
sunshine
for
the
icebergs
of
arctic
night
silly
girl
appreciate
your
good
fortune
can
it
be
possible
clara
that
you
are
fainting
so
soon
where
are
all
your
firm
resolves
if
it
is
your
duty
what
matter
the
difficulties
she
looked
down
pityingly
on
her
companion
as
in
olden
time
one
of
the
athletae
might
have
done
upon
a
drooping
comrade
necessity
knows
no
conditions
beulah
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
labor
in
that
horrible
treadmill
round
day
after
day
you
are
more
fortunate
can
have
a
home
of
elegance
luxury
and
and
dependence
would
you
be
willing
to
change
places
with
me
and
indolently
wait
for
others
to
maintain
you
interrupted
beulah
looking
keenly
at
the
wan
yet
lovely
face
before
her
ah
gladly
if
i
had
been
selected
as
you
were
once
i
too
felt
hopeful
and
joyous
but
now
life
is
dreary
almost
a
burden
be
warned
beulah
do
suffer
your
haughty
spirit
to
make
you
reject
the
offered
home
that
may
be
yours
there
was
a
strong
approach
to
contempt
in
the
expression
with
which
beulah
regarded
her
as
the
last
words
were
uttered
and
she
answered
coldly
you
are
less
a
woman
than
i
thought
you
if
you
would
be
willing
to
live
on
the
bounty
of
others
when
a
little
activity
would
enable
you
to
support
yourself
ah
beulah
it
is
not
only
the
bread
you
eat
or
the
clothes
that
you
wear
it
is
sympathy
and
kindness
love
and
watchfulness
it
is
this
that
a
woman
wants
oh
was
her
heart
made
think
you
to
be
filled
with
grammars
and
geographies
and
can
the
feeling
that
you
are
independent
and
doing
your
duty
satisfy
the
longing
for
other
idols
oh
duty
is
an
icy
shadow
it
will
freeze
you
it
can
not
fill
the
heart
sanctuary
woman
was
intended
as
a
pet
plant
to
be
guarded
and
cherished
isolated
and
uncared
for
she
droops
languishes
and
dies
ah
the
had
exhaled
and
the
morning
glory
had
vanished
the
noontide
heat
of
the
conflict
was
creeping
on
and
she
was
sinking
down
impotent
to
continue
the
struggle
clara
sanders
i
do
believe
one
word
of
all
this
languishing
nonsense
as
to
my
being
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
sickly
geranium
i
know
better
if
you
have
concluded
that
you
belong
to
that
dependent
family
of
plants
i
pity
you
sincerely
and
beg
that
you
will
not
put
me
in
any
such
category
duty
may
be
a
cold
shadow
to
you
but
it
is
a
vast
volcanic
agency
constantly
impelling
me
to
action
what
was
my
will
given
to
me
for
if
to
remain
passive
and
suffer
others
to
minister
to
its
needs
do
talk
to
me
about
woman
clinging
dependent
nature
you
are
opening
your
lips
to
repeat
that
senseless
simile
of
oaks
and
vines
i
do
want
to
hear
it
there
are
no
creeping
tendencies
about
me
you
can
wind
and
lean
and
hang
on
somebody
else
if
you
like
but
i
feel
more
like
one
of
those
old
pine
trees
yonder
i
can
stand
up
very
slim
if
you
will
but
straight
and
high
stand
by
myself
battle
with
wind
and
rain
and
tempest
roar
be
swayed
and
bent
perhaps
in
the
storm
but
stand
unaided
nevertheless
i
feel
humbled
when
i
hear
a
woman
bemoaning
the
weakness
of
her
sex
instead
of
showing
that
she
has
a
soul
and
mind
of
her
own
inferior
to
none
all
that
sounds
very
heroic
in
the
pages
of
a
novel
but
the
reality
is
quite
another
matter
a
tame
joyless
hopeless
time
you
will
have
if
you
scorn
good
fortune
as
you
threaten
and
go
into
the
world
to
support
yourself
answered
clara
impatiently
i
would
rather
struggle
with
her
for
a
crust
than
hang
on
her
garments
asking
a
palace
i
do
know
what
has
come
over
you
you
are
strangely
changed
cried
beulah
pressing
her
hands
on
her
friend
shoulders
the
same
change
will
come
over
you
when
you
endure
what
i
have
with
all
your
boasted
strength
you
are
but
a
woman
have
a
heart
and
one
day
will
be
unable
to
hush
its
hungry
cries
then
i
will
crush
it
so
help
me
heaven
answered
beulah
no
sorrow
will
do
that
time
enough
no
suicidal
effort
will
be
necessary
for
the
first
time
beulah
marked
an
expression
of
bitterness
in
the
usually
gentle
quiet
countenance
she
was
pained
more
than
she
chose
to
evince
and
seeing
hartwell
carriage
at
the
door
prepared
to
return
home
tell
him
that
i
am
very
grateful
for
his
kind
offer
that
his
friendly
remembrance
is
dear
to
a
bereaved
orphan
ah
beulah
i
have
known
him
from
my
childhood
and
he
has
always
been
a
friend
as
well
as
a
physician
during
my
mother
long
illness
he
watched
her
carefully
and
constantly
and
when
we
tendered
him
the
usual
recompense
for
his
services
he
refused
all
remuneration
declaring
he
had
only
been
a
friend
he
knew
we
were
poor
and
could
ill
afford
any
expense
oh
do
you
wonder
that
i
are
you
going
immediately
come
often
when
i
get
to
a
boarding
house
do
beulah
i
am
so
desolate
so
desolate
she
bowed
her
head
on
shoulder
and
wept
unrestrainedly
yes
i
will
come
as
often
as
i
can
and
clara
do
try
to
cheer
up
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
sink
down
in
this
way
she
kissed
the
tearful
face
and
hurried
away
it
was
saturday
and
retiring
to
her
own
room
she
answered
eugene
brief
letter
long
before
she
had
seen
with
painful
anxiety
that
he
wrote
more
and
more
rarely
and
while
his
communications
clearly
conveyed
the
impression
that
he
fancied
they
were
essential
to
her
happiness
the
protective
tenderness
of
early
years
gave
place
to
a
certain
commanding
yet
condescending
tone
intuitively
perceiving
yet
unable
to
analyze
this
gradual
revolution
of
feeling
beulah
was
sometimes
tempted
to
cut
short
the
correspondence
but
her
long
and
ardent
attachment
drowned
the
whispers
of
wounded
pride
and
hallowed
memories
of
his
boyish
love
ever
prevented
an
expression
of
the
pain
and
wonder
with
which
she
beheld
the
alteration
in
his
character
unwilling
to
accuse
him
of
the
weakness
which
prompted
much
of
his
arrogance
and
egotism
her
heart
framed
various
excuses
for
his
seeming
coldness
at
first
she
had
written
often
and
without
reference
to
ordinary
epistolary
debts
but
now
she
regularly
waited
and
that
for
some
time
for
the
arrival
of
his
letters
not
from
a
diminution
of
affection
so
much
as
from
true
womanly
delicacy
lest
she
should
obtrude
herself
too
frequently
upon
his
notice
more
than
once
she
had
been
troubled
by
a
dawning
consciousness
of
her
own
superiority
but
accustomed
for
years
to
look
up
to
him
as
a
sort
of
infallible
guide
she
would
not
admit
the
suggestion
and
tried
to
keep
alive
the
admiring
respect
with
which
she
had
been
wont
to
defer
to
his
judgment
he
seemed
to
consider
his
dogmatic
dictation
both
acceptable
and
necessary
and
it
was
this
assumed
mastery
unaccompanied
with
manifestations
of
former
tenderness
which
irritated
and
aroused
her
pride
with
the
brush
of
youthful
imagination
she
had
painted
him
as
the
future
statesman
gifted
popular
and
revered
and
while
visions
of
his
fame
and
glory
flitted
before
her
the
promise
of
sharing
all
with
her
was
by
no
means
the
least
fascinating
feature
in
her
fancy
picture
of
late
however
he
had
ceased
to
speak
of
the
choice
of
a
profession
and
mentioned
vaguely
graham
wish
that
he
should
acquaint
himself
thoroughly
with
french
german
and
spanish
in
order
to
facilitate
the
correspondence
of
the
firm
with
foreign
houses
she
felt
that
once
embarked
on
the
sea
of
mercantile
life
he
would
have
little
leisure
or
inclination
to
pursue
the
paths
which
she
hoped
to
travel
by
his
side
and
on
this
occasion
her
letter
was
longer
and
more
earnest
than
usual
urging
his
adherence
to
the
original
choice
of
the
law
and
using
every
forcible
argument
she
could
adduce
finally
the
reply
was
sealed
and
directed
and
she
went
down
to
the
study
to
place
it
in
the
marble
receiver
which
stood
on
her
guardian
desk
hal
who
accompanied
the
doctor
in
his
round
of
visits
always
took
their
letters
to
the
post
office
and
punctually
deposited
all
directed
to
them
in
the
vase
to
her
surprise
she
found
no
fire
in
the
grate
the
blinds
were
drawn
closely
and
in
placing
her
letter
on
the
desk
she
noticed
several
addressed
to
the
doctor
and
evidently
unopened
they
must
have
arrived
the
day
before
and
while
she
wondered
at
the
aspect
of
the
room
harriet
entered
miss
beulah
do
you
know
how
long
master
expects
to
be
gone
i
thought
maybe
you
could
tell
when
you
came
home
for
watson
does
not
seem
to
know
any
more
than
i
do
gone
what
do
you
mean
do
you
know
he
has
gone
up
the
river
to
the
plantation
why
i
packed
his
valise
at
daylight
yesterday
and
he
left
in
the
early
morning
boat
he
has
not
been
to
the
plantation
since
just
before
you
came
here
hal
says
he
heard
him
tell
asbury
to
take
charge
of
his
patients
that
his
overseer
had
to
be
looked
after
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
the
plantation
and
i
would
have
asked
him
when
he
was
coming
back
but
he
was
in
one
of
his
unsatisfactory
ways
looked
just
like
his
mouth
had
been
dipped
in
hot
so
i
held
my
tongue
beulah
bit
her
lips
with
annoyance
but
sat
down
before
the
melodeon
and
said
as
unconcernedly
as
possible
i
did
not
know
he
had
left
the
city
and
of
course
have
no
idea
when
he
will
be
back
harriet
please
make
me
a
fire
here
or
call
hal
to
do
it
there
is
a
good
fire
in
the
dining
room
better
go
in
there
and
sit
with
watson
she
is
busy
seeding
raisins
for
mincemeat
and
no
i
would
rather
stay
here
then
i
will
kindle
you
a
fire
right
away
harriet
moved
about
the
room
with
cheerful
alacrity
she
had
always
seemed
to
consider
herself
beulah
special
guardian
and
friend
and
gave
continual
proof
of
the
strength
of
her
affection
evidently
she
desired
to
talk
about
her
master
but
beulah
face
gave
her
no
encouragement
to
proceed
she
made
several
efforts
to
renew
the
conversation
but
they
were
not
seconded
and
she
withdrew
muttering
to
herself
she
is
learning
all
his
ways
he
does
hate
to
talk
any
more
than
he
can
help
and
she
is
patterning
after
him
just
as
fast
as
she
can
they
do
seem
to
know
what
the
lord
gave
them
tongues
for
beulah
practiced
perseveringly
for
some
time
and
then
drawing
a
chair
near
the
fire
sat
down
and
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
she
missed
her
guardian
wanted
to
see
him
felt
surprised
at
his
sudden
departure
and
mortified
that
he
had
not
thought
her
of
sufficient
consequence
to
bid
adieu
to
and
be
apprised
of
his
intended
trip
he
treated
her
precisely
as
he
did
when
she
first
entered
the
house
seemed
to
consider
her
a
mere
child
whereas
she
knew
she
was
no
longer
such
he
never
alluded
to
her
plan
of
teaching
and
when
she
chanced
to
mention
it
he
offered
no
comment
looked
indifferent
or
abstracted
though
invariably
kind
and
sometimes
humorous
there
was
an
impenetrable
reserve
respecting
himself
his
past
and
future
which
was
never
laid
aside
when
not
engaged
with
his
flowers
or
music
he
was
deep
in
some
favorite
volume
and
outside
of
these
sources
of
enjoyment
seemed
to
derive
no
real
pleasure
occasionally
he
had
visitors
but
these
were
generally
strangers
often
persons
residing
at
a
distance
and
beulah
knew
nothing
of
them
several
times
he
had
attended
concerts
and
lectures
but
she
had
never
accompanied
him
and
frequently
when
sitting
by
his
side
felt
as
if
a
glacier
lay
between
them
after
departure
for
new
york
where
she
and
pauline
were
boarding
no
ladies
ever
came
to
the
house
except
a
few
of
middle
age
who
called
now
and
then
to
see
watson
and
utterly
isolated
from
society
beulah
was
conscious
of
entire
ignorance
of
all
that
passed
in
polite
circles
twice
claudia
had
called
but
unable
to
forget
the
past
sufficiently
to
enter
grayson
house
their
intercourse
had
ended
with
claudia
visits
watson
was
a
hearted
and
most
excellent
woman
who
made
an
admirable
housekeeper
but
possessed
few
of
the
qualifications
requisite
to
render
her
an
agreeable
companion
with
an
ambitious
nature
and
an
eager
thirst
for
knowledge
beulah
had
improved
her
advantages
as
only
those
do
who
have
felt
the
need
of
them
while
she
acquired
with
unusual
ease
and
rapidity
the
branches
of
learning
taught
at
school
she
had
availed
herself
of
the
extensive
and
select
library
to
which
she
had
free
access
and
history
biography
travels
essays
and
novels
had
been
perused
with
singular
avidity
hartwell
without
restricting
her
reading
suggested
the
propriety
of
incorporating
more
of
the
poetic
element
in
her
course
the
hint
was
timely
and
induced
an
acquaintance
with
the
great
bards
of
england
and
germany
although
her
taste
led
her
to
select
works
of
another
character
her
secluded
life
favored
habits
of
study
and
at
an
age
when
girls
are
generally
just
beginning
to
traverse
the
fields
of
literature
she
had
progressed
so
far
as
to
explore
some
of
the
footpaths
which
entice
contemplative
minds
from
the
beaten
track
with
earlier
cultivation
and
superiority
of
years
eugene
had
essayed
to
direct
her
reading
but
now
in
point
of
advancement
she
felt
that
she
was
in
the
van
hartwell
had
told
her
whenever
she
was
puzzled
to
come
to
him
for
explanation
and
his
clear
analysis
taught
her
how
immeasurably
superior
he
was
even
to
those
instructors
whose
profession
it
was
to
elucidate
mysteries
accustomed
to
seek
companionship
in
books
she
did
not
upon
the
present
occasion
long
reflect
on
her
guardian
sudden
departure
but
took
from
the
shelves
a
volume
of
poe
which
contained
her
mark
the
parting
rays
of
the
winter
sun
grew
fainter
the
dull
somber
light
of
vanishing
day
made
the
room
dim
and
it
was
only
by
means
of
the
red
glare
from
the
glowing
grate
that
she
deciphered
the
print
finally
the
lamp
was
brought
in
and
shed
a
mellow
radiance
over
the
dusky
apartment
the
volume
was
finished
and
dropped
upon
her
lap
the
spell
of
this
incomparable
sorcerer
was
upon
her
imagination
the
sluggish
lurid
tarn
of
usher
the
pale
gigantic
water
lilies
nodding
their
ghastly
everlasting
heads
over
the
dreary
zaire
the
shrouding
shadow
of
helusion
the
ashen
skies
and
sere
crisped
leaves
in
the
woodland
of
weir
hard
by
the
dim
lake
of
auber
all
lay
with
grim
distinctness
before
her
and
from
the
red
bars
of
the
grate
the
wild
lustrous
appalling
eyes
of
ligeia
looked
out
at
her
while
the
unearthly
tones
of
morella
whispered
from
every
corner
of
the
room
she
rose
and
replaced
the
book
on
the
shelf
striving
to
shake
off
the
dismal
hold
which
all
this
phantasmagoria
had
taken
on
her
fancy
her
eyes
chanced
to
fall
upon
a
bust
of
athene
which
surmounted
her
guardian
desk
and
immediately
the
mournful
refrain
of
the
raven
solemn
and
like
floated
through
the
air
enhancing
the
spectral
element
which
enveloped
her
she
retreated
to
the
parlor
and
running
her
fingers
over
the
keys
of
the
piano
endeavored
by
playing
some
of
her
favorite
airs
to
divest
her
mind
of
the
dreary
unearthly
images
which
haunted
it
the
attempt
was
futile
and
there
in
the
dark
cold
parlor
she
leaned
her
head
against
the
piano
and
gave
herself
up
to
the
guidance
of
one
who
like
the
ancient
mariner
holds
his
listener
fascinated
and
breathless
once
her
guardian
had
warned
her
not
to
study
poe
too
closely
but
the
book
was
often
in
his
own
hand
and
yielding
to
the
matchless
ease
and
rapidity
of
his
diction
she
found
herself
wandering
in
a
wilderness
of
baffling
suggestions
under
the
drapery
of
william
wilson
of
morella
and
ligeia
she
caught
tantalizing
glimpses
of
recondite
psychological
truths
and
processes
which
dimly
hovered
over
her
own
consciousness
but
ever
eluded
the
grasp
of
analysis
while
his
unique
imagery
filled
her
mind
with
wondering
delight
she
shrank
appalled
from
the
mutilated
fragments
which
he
presented
to
her
as
truths
on
the
point
of
his
glittering
scalpel
of
logic
with
the
eagerness
of
a
child
clutching
at
its
own
shadow
in
a
glassy
lake
and
thereby
destroying
it
she
had
read
that
anomalous
prose
poem
eureka
the
quaint
humor
of
that
bottled
letter
first
arrested
her
attention
and
once
launched
on
the
sea
of
cosmogonies
she
was
amazed
at
the
seemingly
infallible
reasoning
which
at
the
conclusion
coolly
informed
her
that
she
was
her
own
god
mystified
shocked
and
yet
admiring
she
had
gone
to
hartwell
for
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
false
she
felt
the
whole
icy
tissue
to
be
yet
could
not
detect
the
adroitly
disguised
sophisms
instead
of
assisting
her
as
usual
he
took
the
book
from
her
smiled
and
put
it
away
saying
indifferently
you
must
not
play
with
such
sharp
tools
just
yet
go
and
practice
your
music
lesson
she
was
too
deeply
interested
to
be
put
off
so
quietly
and
constantly
pondered
this
singular
production
which
confirmed
in
some
degree
a
fancy
of
her
own
concerning
the
of
the
soul
only
on
the
hypothesis
of
an
anterior
life
could
she
explain
some
of
the
mental
phenomena
which
puzzled
her
heedless
of
her
guardian
warning
she
had
striven
to
comprehend
the
philosophy
of
this
methodical
madman
and
now
felt
bewildered
and
restless
this
study
of
poe
was
the
portal
through
which
she
entered
the
vast
pantheon
of
speculation
chapter
xiv
a
week
later
at
the
close
of
a
dull
winter
day
beulah
sat
as
usual
in
the
study
the
large
parlors
and
dining
room
had
a
desolate
look
at
all
times
and
of
the
whole
house
only
the
study
seemed
genial
busily
occupied
during
the
day
it
was
not
until
evening
that
she
realized
her
guardian
absence
no
tidings
of
him
had
been
received
and
she
began
to
wonder
at
his
prolonged
stay
she
felt
very
lonely
without
him
and
though
generally
taciturn
she
missed
him
from
the
hearth
missed
the
tall
form
and
the
sad
stern
face
another
saturday
had
come
and
all
day
she
had
been
with
clara
in
her
new
home
trying
to
cheer
the
mourner
and
dash
away
the
gloom
that
seemed
settling
down
upon
her
spirits
at
dusk
she
returned
home
spent
an
hour
at
the
piano
and
now
walked
up
and
down
the
study
wrapt
in
thought
the
room
had
a
cozy
comfortable
aspect
the
fire
burned
brightly
the
lamplight
silvered
the
paintings
and
statues
and
on
the
rug
before
the
grate
lay
a
huge
black
dog
of
the
bernard
order
his
shaggy
head
thrust
between
his
paws
the
large
intelligent
eyes
followed
beulah
as
she
paced
to
and
fro
and
seemed
mutely
to
question
her
restlessness
his
earnest
scrutiny
attracted
her
notice
and
she
held
out
her
hand
saying
musingly
poor
charon
you
too
miss
your
master
charon
king
of
shadows
when
will
he
come
the
great
black
eyes
gazed
intently
into
hers
and
seemed
to
echo
when
will
he
come
he
lifted
his
grim
head
snuffed
the
air
listened
and
sullenly
dropped
his
face
on
his
paws
again
beulah
threw
herself
on
the
rug
and
laid
her
head
on
his
thick
neck
he
gave
a
quick
short
bark
of
satisfaction
and
very
soon
both
girl
and
dog
were
fast
asleep
a
quarter
of
an
hour
glided
by
and
then
beulah
was
suddenly
roused
by
a
violent
motion
of
her
pillow
charon
sprang
up
and
leaped
frantically
across
the
room
the
comb
which
confined
her
hair
had
fallen
out
and
gathering
up
the
jetty
folds
which
swept
over
her
shoulders
she
looked
around
hartwell
was
closing
the
door
down
charon
you
ebon
scamp
down
you
keeper
of
styx
he
forced
down
the
paws
from
his
shoulders
and
patted
the
shaggy
head
while
his
eyes
rested
affectionately
on
the
delightful
countenance
of
his
sable
favorite
as
he
threw
down
his
gloves
his
eyes
fell
on
beulah
who
had
hastily
risen
from
the
rug
and
he
held
out
his
hand
saying
ah
charon
waked
you
rudely
how
are
you
very
well
thank
you
sir
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
home
so
glad
she
took
his
cold
hand
between
both
hers
rubbed
it
vigorously
and
looked
up
joyfully
in
his
face
she
thought
he
was
paler
and
more
haggard
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
his
hair
clustered
in
disorder
about
his
forehead
his
whole
aspect
was
weary
and
wretched
he
suffered
her
to
keep
his
hand
in
her
warm
tight
clasp
and
asked
kindly
are
you
well
beulah
your
face
is
flushed
and
you
feel
feverish
perfectly
well
but
you
are
as
cold
as
an
esquimaux
hunter
come
to
the
fire
she
drew
his
armchair
with
its
and
board
close
to
the
hearth
and
put
his
warm
velvet
slippers
before
him
she
forgot
her
wounded
pride
forgot
that
he
had
left
without
even
bidding
her
good
by
and
only
remembered
that
he
had
come
home
again
that
he
was
sitting
there
in
the
study
and
she
would
be
lonely
no
more
silently
leaning
back
in
the
chair
he
closed
his
eyes
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
felt
as
if
she
would
like
very
much
to
smooth
off
the
curling
hair
that
lay
thick
and
damp
on
his
white
gleaming
brow
but
dared
not
she
stood
watching
him
for
a
moment
and
said
considerately
will
you
have
your
tea
now
charon
and
i
had
our
supper
long
ago
no
child
i
only
want
to
rest
beulah
fancied
he
spoke
impatiently
had
she
been
too
officious
in
welcoming
him
to
his
own
home
she
bit
her
lip
with
proud
vexation
and
taking
her
geometry
left
him
as
she
reached
the
door
the
doctor
called
to
her
beulah
you
need
not
go
away
this
is
a
better
fire
than
the
one
in
your
own
room
but
she
was
wounded
and
did
not
choose
to
stay
i
can
study
better
in
my
own
room
sir
why
child
this
is
saturday
night
no
lessons
until
monday
she
was
not
particularly
mollified
by
the
reiteration
of
the
word
child
and
answered
coldly
there
are
hard
lessons
for
every
day
we
live
well
be
good
enough
to
hand
me
the
letters
that
have
arrived
during
my
absence
she
emptied
the
letter
receiver
and
placed
several
communications
in
his
hand
he
pointed
to
a
chair
near
the
fire
and
said
quietly
sit
down
my
child
sit
down
too
proud
to
discover
how
much
she
was
piqued
by
his
coldness
she
took
the
seat
and
commenced
studying
but
lines
and
angles
swam
confusedly
before
her
and
shutting
the
book
she
sat
looking
into
the
fire
while
her
eyes
roamed
into
the
deep
glowing
crevices
of
the
coals
a
letter
was
hurled
into
the
fiery
mass
and
in
an
instant
blazed
and
shriveled
to
ashes
she
looked
up
in
surprise
and
started
at
the
expression
of
her
guardian
face
its
like
beauty
had
vanished
the
pale
lips
writhed
displaying
the
faultless
teeth
the
thin
nostrils
were
expanded
and
the
eyes
burned
with
fierce
anger
the
avalanche
was
upheaved
by
hidden
volcanic
fires
and
he
exclaimed
with
scornful
emphasis
idiot
blind
lunatic
in
his
dotage
there
was
something
so
marvelous
in
this
excited
angry
manifestation
that
beulah
who
had
never
before
seen
him
other
than
phlegmatic
looked
at
him
with
curious
wonder
his
clenched
hand
rested
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
he
continued
sarcastically
oh
a
precious
pair
of
idiots
they
will
have
a
glorious
life
such
harmony
such
congeniality
such
incomparable
sweetness
on
her
part
such
equable
spirits
on
his
not
the
surpassing
repose
of
a
windless
tropic
night
can
approach
to
the
divine
serenity
of
their
future
ha
by
the
furies
he
will
have
an
enviable
companion
a
matchless
griselda
laughing
scornfully
he
started
up
and
strode
across
the
floor
as
beulah
caught
the
withering
expression
which
sat
on
every
feature
she
shuddered
involuntarily
could
she
bear
to
incur
his
contempt
he
approached
her
and
she
felt
as
though
her
very
soul
shrank
from
him
his
glowing
eyes
seemed
to
burn
her
face
as
he
paused
and
said
ironically
ca
you
participate
in
my
joy
i
have
a
new
congratulate
me
on
my
sister
marriage
such
desperate
good
news
can
come
but
rarely
in
a
lifetime
whom
has
she
married
sir
asked
beulah
shrinking
from
the
iron
grasp
on
her
shoulder
percy
lockhart
of
course
he
will
rue
his
madness
i
warned
him
now
let
him
seek
apples
in
the
orchards
of
sodom
let
him
lay
his
parched
lips
to
the
treacherous
waves
of
the
dead
sea
oh
i
pity
the
fool
i
tried
to
save
him
but
he
would
seal
his
own
doom
let
him
pay
the
usurious
of
experience
perhaps
your
sister
love
for
him
will
oh
you
young
ignorant
lamb
you
poor
little
unfledged
birdling
i
suppose
you
fancy
she
is
really
attached
to
him
do
you
indeed
about
as
much
as
that
pillar
of
salt
in
the
plain
of
sodom
was
attached
to
the
memory
of
lot
about
as
much
as
this
peerless
niobe
of
mine
is
attached
to
me
he
struck
the
marble
statue
as
he
spoke
then
how
could
she
marry
him
asked
beulah
naively
ha
ha
i
will
present
you
to
the
smithsonian
institution
as
the
last
embodiment
of
effete
theories
who
exhumed
you
patron
saint
of
archaism
from
the
of
centuries
he
looked
down
at
her
with
an
expression
of
intolerable
bitterness
and
scorn
her
habitually
pale
face
flushed
to
crimson
as
she
answered
with
sparkling
eyes
not
the
hand
of
diogenes
encumbered
with
his
tub
he
smiled
grimly
know
the
world
as
i
do
child
and
tubs
and
palaces
will
be
alike
to
you
feel
the
pulse
of
humanity
and
you
will
heaven
preserve
me
from
looking
on
life
through
your
spectacles
cried
she
impetuously
stung
by
the
contemptuous
smile
which
curled
his
lips
amen
taking
his
hands
from
her
shoulder
he
threw
himself
back
into
his
chair
there
was
silence
for
some
minutes
and
beulah
said
i
thought
lockhart
was
in
syria
oh
no
he
wants
a
companion
in
his
jaunt
to
the
holy
land
how
devoutly
may
will
kneel
on
olivet
and
moriah
what
pious
tears
will
stain
her
lovely
cheek
as
she
stands
in
the
hall
of
pilate
and
calls
to
mind
all
the
thirty
years
history
oh
percy
is
cruel
to
subject
her
tender
soul
to
such
torturing
associations
beulah
go
and
play
something
no
matter
what
anything
to
hush
my
cursing
mood
go
child
he
turned
away
his
face
to
hide
its
bitterness
and
seating
herself
at
the
melodeon
beulah
played
a
german
air
of
which
he
was
very
fond
at
the
conclusion
he
merely
said
sing
a
plaintive
prelude
followed
the
command
and
she
sang
no
description
could
do
justice
to
the
magnificent
voice
as
it
swelled
deep
and
full
in
its
tones
now
thrillingly
low
in
its
wailing
melody
and
now
ringing
clear
and
sweet
as
silver
bells
there
were
soft
rippling
notes
that
seemed
to
echo
from
the
deeps
of
her
soul
and
voice
its
immensity
it
was
wonderful
what
compass
there
was
what
rare
sweetness
and
purity
too
it
was
a
natural
gift
like
that
conferred
on
birds
art
could
not
produce
it
but
practice
and
scientific
culture
had
improved
and
perfected
it
for
three
years
the
best
teachers
had
instructed
her
and
she
felt
that
now
she
was
mistress
of
a
spell
which
once
invoked
might
easily
exorcise
the
evil
spirit
which
had
taken
possession
of
her
guardian
she
sang
several
of
his
favorite
songs
then
closed
the
melodeon
and
went
back
to
the
fire
hartwell
face
lay
against
the
purple
velvet
lining
of
the
chair
and
the
dark
surface
gave
out
the
contour
with
bold
distinctness
his
eyes
were
closed
and
as
beulah
watched
him
she
thought
how
inflexible
he
looks
how
like
a
marble
image
the
mouth
seems
as
if
the
sculptor
chisel
had
just
carved
it
so
stern
so
stony
ah
he
is
not
scornful
now
he
looks
only
sad
uncomplaining
but
very
miserable
what
has
steeled
his
heart
and
made
him
so
unrelenting
so
haughty
what
can
have
isolated
him
so
completely
nature
lavished
on
him
every
gift
which
could
render
him
the
charm
of
social
circles
yet
he
lives
in
the
seclusion
of
his
own
heart
independent
of
sympathy
contemptuous
of
the
world
he
was
sent
to
improve
and
bless
these
reflections
were
interrupted
by
his
opening
his
eyes
and
saying
in
his
ordinary
calm
tone
thank
you
beulah
did
you
finish
that
opera
i
spoke
of
some
time
since
yes
sir
you
found
it
difficult
not
so
difficult
as
your
description
led
me
to
imagine
were
you
lonely
while
i
was
away
yes
sir
why
did
not
clara
come
and
stay
with
you
she
was
engaged
in
changing
her
home
has
removed
to
boarding
house
when
did
you
see
her
last
how
does
she
bear
the
blow
i
was
with
her
she
is
desponding
and
seems
to
grow
more
so
daily
she
wondered
very
much
whether
he
suspected
the
preference
which
she
felt
sure
clara
entertained
for
him
and
as
the
subject
recurred
to
her
she
looked
troubled
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
accustomed
to
reading
her
expressive
face
nothing
that
can
be
remedied
sir
how
do
you
know
that
suppose
you
let
me
be
the
judge
you
could
not
judge
of
it
sir
and
besides
it
is
no
concern
of
mine
a
frigid
smile
fled
over
his
face
and
for
some
time
he
appeared
lost
in
thought
his
companion
was
thinking
too
wondering
how
clara
could
cope
with
such
a
nature
as
his
wondering
why
people
always
selected
persons
totally
unsuited
to
them
and
fancying
that
if
clara
only
knew
her
guardian
character
as
well
as
she
did
the
gentle
girl
would
shrink
in
dread
from
his
unbending
will
his
habitual
moody
taciturnity
he
was
generous
and
unselfish
but
also
as
unyielding
as
the
rock
of
gibraltar
there
was
nothing
pleasurable
in
this
train
of
thought
and
taking
up
a
book
she
soon
ceased
to
think
of
the
motionless
figure
opposite
no
sooner
were
her
eyes
once
fastened
on
her
book
than
his
rested
searchingly
on
her
face
at
first
she
read
without
much
manifestation
of
interest
regularly
and
slowly
passing
her
hand
over
the
black
head
which
charon
had
laid
on
her
lap
after
a
while
the
lips
parted
eagerly
the
leaves
were
turned
quickly
and
the
touches
on
head
ceased
her
long
black
lashes
could
not
veil
the
expression
of
enthusiastic
pleasure
another
page
fluttered
over
a
flush
stole
across
her
brow
and
as
she
closed
the
volume
her
whole
face
was
irradiated
what
are
you
reading
asked
hartwell
when
she
seemed
to
sink
into
a
reverie
analects
from
richter
de
quincey
yes
sir
once
that
marvelous
upon
the
universe
fascinated
me
as
completely
as
it
now
does
you
memories
of
earlier
days
clustered
about
him
parting
the
somber
clouds
with
their
rosy
fingers
his
features
began
to
soften
sir
can
you
read
it
now
without
feeling
your
soul
kindle
yes
child
it
has
lost
its
interest
for
me
i
read
it
as
indifferently
as
i
do
one
of
my
medical
books
so
will
you
one
day
never
it
shall
be
a
to
my
soul
telling
of
the
pathway
arched
with
galaxies
and
paved
with
suns
through
which
that
soul
shall
pass
in
triumph
to
its
final
rest
and
who
shall
remain
in
that
dungeon
of
pure
pure
darkness
which
imprisons
creation
that
dead
sea
of
nothing
in
whose
unfathomable
zone
of
blackness
the
jewel
of
the
glittering
universe
is
set
and
buried
forever
child
is
not
that
too
a
he
passed
his
fingers
through
his
hair
sweeping
it
all
back
from
his
ample
forehead
beulah
opened
the
book
and
read
aloud
immediately
my
eyes
were
opened
and
i
saw
as
it
were
an
interminable
sea
of
light
all
spaces
between
all
heavens
were
filled
with
happiest
light
for
the
deserts
and
wastes
of
the
creation
were
now
filled
with
the
sea
of
light
and
in
this
sea
the
suns
floated
like
blossoms
and
the
planets
like
black
grains
of
seed
then
my
heart
comprehended
that
immortality
dwelled
in
the
spaces
between
the
worlds
and
death
only
among
the
worlds
and
the
murky
planets
i
perceived
were
but
cradles
for
the
infant
spirits
of
the
universe
of
light
in
the
zaarahs
of
the
creation
i
saw
i
heard
i
felt
the
glittering
the
echoing
the
breathing
of
life
and
creative
power
she
closed
the
volume
and
while
her
lips
trembled
with
deep
feeling
added
earnestly
oh
sir
it
makes
me
long
like
jean
paul
some
narrow
cell
or
quiet
oratory
in
this
metropolitan
cathedral
of
the
universe
it
is
an
infinite
conception
and
painting
of
infinity
which
my
soul
endeavors
to
grasp
but
wearies
in
thinking
of
hartwell
smiled
and
pointing
to
a
row
of
books
said
with
some
eagerness
i
will
test
your
love
of
jean
paul
give
me
that
large
volume
in
crimson
binding
on
the
second
shelf
no
further
on
that
is
it
he
turned
over
the
leaves
for
a
few
minutes
and
with
a
finger
still
on
the
page
put
it
into
her
hand
saying
begin
here
at
went
through
the
worlds
and
read
down
to
i
awoke
she
sat
down
and
read
he
put
his
hand
carelessly
over
his
eyes
and
watched
her
curiously
through
his
fingers
it
was
evident
that
she
soon
became
intensely
interested
he
could
see
the
fierce
throbbing
of
a
vein
in
her
throat
and
the
tight
clutching
of
her
fingers
her
eyebrows
met
in
the
wrinkling
forehead
and
the
lips
were
compressed
severely
gradually
the
flush
faded
from
her
cheek
an
expression
of
pain
and
horror
swept
over
her
stormy
face
and
rising
hastily
she
exclaimed
false
false
everlasting
storm
which
no
one
guides
tells
me
in
thunder
tones
that
there
is
a
home
of
rest
in
the
presence
of
the
infinite
father
oh
chance
does
not
roam
like
a
destroying
angel
through
that
of
stars
the
love
of
our
god
is
over
all
his
works
as
a
mantle
though
you
should
the
wings
of
the
morning
and
dwell
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
sea
lo
he
is
there
the
sorrowing
children
of
the
universe
are
not
orphans
neither
did
richter
believe
it
well
might
he
declare
that
with
this
sketch
he
would
himself
and
vanquish
the
specter
of
atheism
oh
sir
the
dear
god
stretches
his
arm
about
each
and
all
of
us
the
lays
himself
with
a
galled
back
into
the
earth
to
sleep
till
a
fairer
morning
it
is
not
true
that
awakens
in
a
stormy
chaos
in
an
everlasting
midnight
it
is
not
true
he
goes
home
to
his
loved
dead
and
spends
a
blissful
eternity
in
the
kingdom
of
jehovah
where
death
is
no
more
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
she
laid
the
volume
on
his
knee
and
tears
which
would
not
be
restrained
rolled
swiftly
over
her
cheeks
he
looked
at
her
mournfully
and
took
her
hand
in
his
my
child
do
you
believe
all
this
as
heartily
as
you
did
when
a
little
girl
is
your
faith
in
your
religion
unshaken
he
felt
her
fingers
close
over
his
spasmodically
as
she
hastily
replied
of
course
of
course
what
could
shake
a
faith
which
years
should
strengthen
but
the
shiver
which
crept
through
her
frame
denied
her
assertion
and
with
a
keen
pang
he
saw
the
footprints
of
the
destroyer
she
must
not
know
however
that
he
doubted
her
words
and
with
an
effort
he
said
i
am
glad
beulah
and
if
you
would
continue
to
believe
do
read
my
books
promiscuously
there
are
many
on
those
shelves
yonder
which
i
would
advise
you
never
to
open
be
warned
in
time
my
child
she
snatched
her
hand
from
his
and
answered
proudly
sir
think
you
i
could
be
satisfied
with
a
creed
which
i
could
not
bear
to
have
investigated
if
i
abstained
from
reading
your
books
dreading
lest
my
faith
be
shaken
then
i
could
no
longer
confide
in
that
faith
christianity
has
triumphed
over
the
subtleties
of
infidelity
for
eighteen
hundred
years
what
have
i
to
fear
beulah
do
you
want
to
be
just
what
i
am
without
belief
in
any
creed
hopeless
of
eternity
as
of
life
do
you
want
to
be
like
me
if
not
keep
your
hands
off
of
my
books
good
night
it
is
time
for
you
to
be
asleep
he
motioned
her
away
and
too
much
pained
to
reply
she
silently
withdrew
chapter
xv
the
day
had
been
clear
though
cold
and
late
in
the
afternoon
beulah
wrapped
a
shawl
about
her
and
ran
out
into
the
front
yard
for
a
walk
the
rippling
tones
of
the
fountain
were
hushed
the
shrubs
were
bare
and
outside
the
greenhouse
not
a
flower
was
to
be
seen
even
the
hardy
chrysanthemums
were
brown
and
shriveled
here
vegetation
slumbered
in
the
grave
of
winter
the
hedges
were
green
and
occasional
clumps
of
cassina
bent
their
branches
beneath
the
weight
of
coral
fruitage
tall
poplars
lifted
their
leafless
arms
helplessly
toward
the
sky
and
threw
grotesque
shadows
on
the
ground
beneath
while
the
wintry
wind
chanted
a
mournful
dirge
through
the
somber
foliage
of
the
aged
solemn
cedars
noisy
flocks
of
robins
fluttered
among
the
trees
eating
the
ripe
red
yaupon
berries
and
now
and
then
parties
of
pigeons
circled
round
and
round
the
house
charon
lay
on
the
doorstep
blinking
at
the
setting
sun
with
his
sage
face
dropped
on
his
paws
afar
off
was
heard
the
hum
of
the
city
but
here
all
was
quiet
and
peaceful
beulah
looked
over
the
beds
lately
so
brilliant
and
fragrant
in
their
wealth
of
floral
beauty
at
the
bare
gray
poplars
whose
musical
rustling
had
so
often
hushed
her
to
sleep
in
cloudless
summer
nights
and
an
expression
of
serious
thoughtfulness
settled
on
her
face
many
months
before
she
had
watched
the
opening
spring
in
this
same
garden
had
seen
young
leaves
and
delicate
blossoms
bud
out
from
naked
stems
had
noted
their
rich
luxuriance
as
the
summer
heat
came
on
their
mature
beauty
and
when
the
first
breath
of
autumn
sighed
through
the
land
she
saw
them
flush
and
decline
and
gradually
die
and
rustle
down
to
their
graves
now
where
green
boughs
and
perfumed
petals
had
gayly
looked
up
in
the
sunlight
all
was
desolate
the
piercing
northern
wind
seemed
to
whisper
as
it
passed
life
is
but
the
germ
of
death
and
death
the
development
of
a
higher
life
was
the
cycle
eternal
then
were
the
beautiful
ephemeras
she
had
loved
so
dearly
gone
down
into
the
night
of
death
but
for
a
season
to
be
born
again
in
some
distant
springtime
mature
and
return
as
before
to
the
were
the
threescore
and
ten
years
of
human
life
analogous
life
too
had
its
springtime
its
summer
of
maturity
its
autumnal
decline
and
its
wintry
night
of
death
were
the
cold
sleepers
in
the
neighboring
cemetery
waiting
like
those
dead
flowers
for
the
tireless
processes
of
nature
whereby
their
dust
was
to
be
reanimated
remolded
lighted
with
a
soul
and
set
forward
for
another
journey
of
threescore
and
ten
years
of
life
and
labor
men
lived
and
died
their
ashes
enriched
mother
earth
new
creations
sprang
like
from
the
sepulcher
of
the
old
another
generation
trod
path
in
the
dim
footprints
of
their
predecessors
and
that
too
vanished
in
the
appointed
process
mingling
dust
with
dust
that
protean
matter
might
hold
the
even
tenor
of
its
way
in
accordance
with
the
oracular
decrees
of
isis
was
it
true
that
since
the
original
genesis
nothing
had
been
gained
and
nothing
lost
was
earth
indeed
a
monstrous
kronos
if
so
was
not
she
as
old
as
creation
to
how
many
other
souls
had
her
body
given
shelter
how
was
her
identity
to
be
maintained
true
she
had
read
that
identity
was
housed
in
consciousness
not
bones
and
muscles
but
could
there
be
consciousness
without
bones
and
muscles
she
drew
her
shawl
closely
around
her
and
looked
up
at
the
cloudless
sea
of
azure
the
sun
had
sunk
below
the
horizon
the
birds
had
all
gone
to
rest
charon
had
sought
the
study
rug
even
the
distant
hum
of
the
city
was
no
longer
heard
the
silver
sparks
of
stars
were
rising
on
the
altar
of
the
east
and
falling
down
in
the
red
sea
of
the
west
beulah
was
chilled
there
were
cold
thoughts
in
her
mind
icy
specters
in
her
heart
and
she
quickened
her
pace
up
and
down
the
avenue
dusky
beneath
the
ancient
gloomy
cedars
one
idea
haunted
her
aside
from
revelation
what
proof
had
she
that
unlike
those
moldering
flowers
her
spirit
should
never
die
no
trace
was
to
be
found
of
the
myriads
of
souls
who
had
preceded
her
where
were
the
countless
hosts
were
life
and
death
balanced
was
her
own
soul
chiliads
old
forgetting
its
former
existences
save
as
dim
undefinable
reminiscences
flashed
fitfully
upon
it
if
so
was
it
a
progression
how
did
she
know
that
her
soul
had
not
entered
her
body
fresh
from
the
release
of
the
hangman
instead
of
coming
down
on
angel
wings
from
its
starry
home
as
she
had
loved
to
think
a
passage
which
she
had
read
many
weeks
before
flashed
upon
her
mind
upon
the
dead
mother
in
peace
and
utter
gloom
are
reposing
the
dead
children
after
a
time
uprises
the
everlasting
sun
and
the
mother
starts
up
at
the
summons
of
the
heavenly
dawn
with
a
resurrection
of
her
ancient
bloom
and
her
children
yes
but
they
must
wait
a
while
this
resurrection
was
springtime
beckoning
dormant
beauty
from
the
icy
arms
of
winter
how
long
must
the
children
wait
for
the
uprising
of
the
morning
star
of
eternity
from
childhood
these
unvoiced
queries
had
perplexed
her
mind
and
strengthening
with
her
growth
now
cried
out
peremptorily
for
answers
with
shuddering
dread
she
strove
to
stifle
the
spirit
which
once
thoroughly
awakened
threatened
to
explore
every
nook
and
cranny
of
mystery
she
longed
to
talk
freely
with
her
guardian
regarding
many
of
the
suggestions
which
puzzled
her
but
shrank
instinctively
from
broaching
such
topics
now
in
her
need
the
sublime
words
of
job
came
to
her
oh
that
my
words
were
now
written
oh
that
they
were
printed
in
a
book
for
i
know
that
my
redeemer
liveth
and
that
he
shall
stand
at
the
latter
day
upon
the
earth
and
though
worms
destroy
this
body
yet
in
my
flesh
shall
i
see
god
handel
messiah
had
invested
this
passage
with
resistless
grandeur
and
leaving
the
cold
dreary
garden
she
sat
down
before
the
melodeon
and
sang
a
portion
of
the
oratorio
the
sublime
strains
seemed
to
bear
her
worshiping
soul
up
to
the
of
deity
and
exultingly
she
repeated
the
concluding
words
for
now
is
christ
risen
from
the
dead
the
of
them
that
sleep
the
triumph
of
faith
shone
in
her
kindled
eyes
though
glittering
drops
fell
on
the
ivory
keys
and
the
whole
countenance
bespoke
a
heart
resting
in
the
love
of
the
father
while
her
fingers
still
rolled
waves
of
melody
through
the
room
hartwell
entered
with
a
parcel
in
one
hand
and
a
magnificent
cluster
of
greenhouse
flowers
in
the
other
he
laid
the
latter
before
beulah
and
said
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
to
hear
sontag
the
concert
commences
at
eight
and
you
have
no
time
to
spare
here
are
some
flowers
for
your
hair
arrange
it
as
you
have
it
now
and
here
also
a
pair
of
white
gloves
when
you
are
ready
come
down
and
make
my
tea
thank
you
sir
for
remembering
me
so
kindly
and
supplying
all
my
wants
so
beulah
there
are
tears
on
your
lashes
what
is
the
matter
interrupted
the
doctor
pointing
to
the
drops
which
had
fallen
on
the
rosewood
frame
of
the
melodeon
is
it
not
enough
to
bring
tears
to
my
eyes
when
i
think
of
all
your
kindness
she
hurried
away
without
suffering
him
to
urge
the
matter
the
prospect
of
hearing
sontag
gave
her
exquisite
pleasure
and
she
dressed
with
trembling
eagerness
while
harriet
leaned
on
the
bureau
and
wondered
what
would
happen
next
except
to
attend
church
and
visit
clara
and
williams
beulah
had
never
gone
out
before
and
the
very
seclusion
in
which
she
lived
rendered
this
occasion
one
of
interest
and
importance
as
she
took
her
cloak
and
ran
downstairs
the
young
heart
throbbed
violently
would
her
fastidious
guardian
be
satisfied
with
her
appearance
she
felt
the
blood
gush
over
her
face
as
she
entered
the
room
but
he
did
not
look
at
her
continued
to
read
the
newspaper
he
held
and
said
from
behind
the
extended
sheet
i
will
join
you
directly
she
poured
out
the
tea
with
an
unsteady
hand
hartwell
took
his
silently
and
as
both
rose
from
the
table
handed
her
a
paper
saying
the
carriage
is
not
quite
ready
yet
there
is
a
programme
as
she
glanced
over
it
he
scanned
her
closely
and
an
expression
of
satisfaction
settled
on
his
features
she
wore
a
dark
blue
silk
one
he
had
given
her
some
weeks
before
which
exquisitely
fitted
her
slender
graceful
figure
and
was
relieved
by
a
lace
collar
fastened
with
a
handsome
cameo
pin
also
his
gift
the
glossy
black
hair
was
brushed
straight
back
from
the
face
in
accordance
with
the
prevailing
style
and
wound
into
a
knot
at
the
back
of
the
head
on
either
side
of
this
knot
she
wore
a
superb
white
camellia
which
contrasted
well
with
the
raven
hair
her
face
was
pale
but
the
expression
was
one
of
eager
expectation
as
the
carriage
rattled
up
to
the
door
he
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
said
you
look
very
well
my
child
those
white
japonicas
become
you
she
breathed
freely
once
more
at
the
door
of
the
concert
hall
he
gave
her
his
arm
and
while
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
detained
them
a
moment
at
the
entrance
she
clung
to
him
with
a
feeling
of
dependence
utterly
new
to
her
the
din
of
voices
the
dazzling
glare
of
the
bewildered
her
and
she
walked
on
mechanically
till
the
doctor
entered
his
seat
and
placed
her
beside
him
the
brilliant
chandeliers
shone
down
on
elegant
dresses
glittering
diamonds
and
beautiful
women
and
looking
forward
beulah
was
reminded
of
the
glowing
descriptions
in
the
arabian
nights
she
observed
that
many
curious
eyes
were
bent
upon
her
and
ere
she
had
been
seated
five
minutes
more
than
one
lorgnette
was
leveled
at
her
everybody
knew
hartwell
and
she
saw
him
constantly
returning
the
bows
of
recognition
which
assailed
him
from
the
ladies
in
their
vicinity
presently
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
and
she
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
the
ineffectual
attempts
made
to
arrest
his
attention
the
hall
was
crowded
and
as
the
seats
filled
to
their
utmost
capacity
she
was
pressed
against
her
guardian
he
looked
down
at
her
and
whispered
very
democratic
eh
beulah
she
smiled
and
was
about
to
reply
when
her
attention
was
attracted
by
a
party
which
just
then
took
their
places
immediately
in
front
of
her
it
consisted
of
an
elderly
gentleman
and
two
ladies
one
of
whom
beulah
instantly
recognized
as
cornelia
graham
she
was
now
a
rather
than
beautiful
woman
and
the
incipient
pride
so
apparent
in
girlhood
had
matured
into
almost
repulsive
hauteur
she
was
very
richly
dressed
and
her
brilliant
black
eyes
wandered
indifferently
over
the
room
as
though
such
assemblages
had
lost
their
novelty
and
interest
for
her
chancing
to
look
back
she
perceived
hartwell
bowed
and
said
with
a
smile
pray
do
not
think
me
obstinate
i
had
no
wish
to
come
but
father
insisted
i
am
glad
you
feel
well
enough
to
be
here
was
his
careless
reply
cornelia
eyes
fell
upon
the
quiet
figure
at
his
side
and
as
beulah
me
her
steady
gaze
she
felt
something
of
her
old
dislike
warming
in
her
eyes
they
had
never
met
since
the
morning
of
cornelia
contemptuous
treatment
at
madam
cymon
and
now
to
beulah
utter
astonishment
she
deliberately
turned
round
put
out
her
hand
over
the
back
of
the
seat
and
said
energetically
how
are
you
beulah
you
have
altered
so
materially
that
i
scarcely
knew
you
beulah
nature
was
generous
she
was
glad
to
forget
old
injuries
and
as
their
hands
met
in
a
friendly
clasp
she
answered
you
have
changed
but
little
and
that
for
the
worse
as
people
have
a
pleasant
way
of
telling
me
beulah
i
want
to
know
honestly
if
my
rudeness
caused
you
to
leave
madam
school
that
was
not
my
only
reason
replied
beulah
very
candidly
at
this
moment
a
burst
of
applause
greeted
the
appearance
of
the
cantatrice
and
all
conversation
was
suspended
beulah
listened
to
the
warbling
of
the
queen
of
song
with
a
thrill
of
delight
passionately
fond
of
music
she
appreciated
the
brilliant
execution
and
entrancing
melody
as
probably
very
few
in
that
crowded
house
could
have
done
with
some
of
the
pieces
selected
she
was
familiar
and
others
she
had
long
desired
to
hear
she
was
unconscious
of
the
steady
look
with
which
her
guardian
watched
her
as
with
parted
lips
she
leaned
eagerly
forward
to
catch
every
note
when
sontag
left
the
stage
and
the
hum
of
conversation
was
heard
once
more
beulah
looked
up
with
a
long
sigh
of
delight
and
murmured
oh
sir
is
she
a
glorious
woman
miss
graham
is
speaking
to
you
said
he
coolly
she
raised
her
head
and
saw
the
young
lady
eyes
riveted
on
her
countenance
beulah
when
did
you
hear
from
eugene
about
three
weeks
since
i
believe
we
leave
for
europe
day
after
shall
perhaps
go
directly
to
heidelberg
have
you
any
commissions
any
messages
under
the
mask
of
seeming
indifference
she
watched
beulah
intently
as
shrinking
from
the
cold
searching
eyes
the
latter
replied
thank
you
i
have
neither
to
trouble
you
with
again
the
appeared
on
the
stage
and
again
beulah
forgot
everything
but
the
witching
strains
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
songs
she
felt
her
guardian
start
violently
and
the
hand
which
rested
on
his
knee
was
clinched
spasmodically
she
looked
at
him
the
wonted
pale
face
was
flushed
to
the
edge
of
his
hair
the
blue
veins
stood
out
hard
and
corded
on
his
brow
and
the
eyes
like
burning
stars
were
fixed
on
some
object
not
very
remote
while
he
gnawed
his
lip
as
if
unconscious
of
what
he
did
following
the
direction
of
his
gaze
she
saw
that
it
was
fastened
on
a
gentleman
who
sat
at
some
little
distance
from
them
the
position
he
occupied
rendered
his
countenance
visible
and
a
glance
sufficed
to
show
her
that
the
features
were
handsome
the
expression
sinister
malignant
and
cunning
his
entire
appearance
was
foreign
and
conveyed
the
idea
of
reckless
dissipation
evidently
he
came
there
not
for
the
music
but
to
scan
the
crowd
and
his
fierce
eyes
roamed
over
the
audience
with
a
daring
impudence
which
disgusted
her
suddenly
they
rested
on
her
own
face
wandered
to
hartwell
and
lingering
there
a
full
moment
with
a
look
of
defiant
hatred
returned
to
her
causing
her
to
shudder
at
the
intensity
and
freedom
of
his
gaze
she
drew
herself
up
proudly
and
with
an
air
of
haughty
contempt
fixed
her
attention
on
the
stage
but
the
spell
of
enchantment
was
broken
she
could
hear
the
deep
irregular
breathing
of
her
guardian
and
knew
from
the
way
in
which
he
stared
down
on
the
floor
that
he
could
with
difficulty
remain
quietly
in
his
place
she
was
glad
when
the
concert
ended
and
the
mass
of
heads
began
to
move
toward
the
door
with
a
species
of
curiosity
that
she
could
not
repress
she
glanced
at
the
stranger
their
eyes
met
as
before
and
his
smile
of
triumphant
scorn
made
her
cling
closer
to
her
guardian
arm
and
take
care
not
to
look
in
that
direction
again
she
felt
inexpressibly
relieved
when
hurried
on
by
the
crowd
in
the
rear
they
emerged
from
the
heated
room
into
a
long
dim
passage
leading
to
the
street
they
were
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
chattering
groups
and
while
the
light
was
too
faint
to
distinguish
faces
these
words
fell
on
her
ear
with
painful
distinctness
i
suppose
that
was
hartwell
protegee
he
had
with
him
he
is
a
great
curiosity
think
of
a
man
of
his
age
and
appearance
settling
down
as
if
he
were
sixty
years
old
and
adopting
a
beggarly
orphan
she
is
not
at
all
pretty
what
can
have
possessed
him
no
not
pretty
exactly
but
there
is
something
odd
in
her
appearance
her
brow
is
magnificent
and
i
should
judge
she
was
intellectual
she
is
as
colorless
as
a
ghost
no
accounting
for
hartwell
ten
to
one
he
will
marry
her
i
have
heard
it
surmised
that
he
was
educating
her
for
a
wife
here
the
party
who
were
in
advance
vanished
and
as
he
approached
the
carriage
hartwell
said
coolly
another
specimen
of
democracy
beulah
felt
as
if
a
lava
tide
surged
madly
in
her
veins
and
as
the
carriage
rolled
homeward
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
wounded
pride
indignation
and
contempt
struggled
violently
in
her
heart
for
some
moments
there
was
silence
then
her
guardian
drew
her
hands
from
her
face
held
them
firmly
in
his
and
leaning
forward
said
gravely
beulah
malice
and
envy
love
lofty
marks
learn
as
i
have
done
to
look
down
with
scorn
from
the
summit
of
indifference
upon
the
feeble
darts
aimed
from
the
pits
beneath
you
my
child
do
suffer
the
senseless
gossip
of
the
shallow
crowd
to
wound
you
she
endeavored
to
withdraw
her
hands
but
his
unyielding
grasp
prevented
her
beulah
you
must
conquer
your
morbid
sensitiveness
if
you
would
have
your
life
other
than
a
dreary
burden
oh
sir
you
are
not
invulnerable
to
these
wounds
how
then
can
i
an
orphan
girl
receive
them
with
indifference
she
spoke
passionately
and
drooped
her
burning
face
till
it
touched
his
arm
ah
you
observed
my
agitation
but
for
a
vow
made
to
my
dying
mother
that
villian
blood
had
long
since
removed
all
grounds
of
emotion
six
years
ago
he
fled
from
me
and
his
unexpected
reappearance
excited
me
more
than
i
had
fancied
it
was
possible
for
anything
to
do
his
voice
was
as
low
calm
and
musical
as
though
he
were
reading
aloud
to
her
some
poetic
tale
of
injuries
and
in
the
same
even
quiet
tone
he
added
it
is
well
all
have
a
nemesis
not
on
earth
sir
wait
till
you
have
lived
as
long
as
i
and
you
will
think
with
me
beulah
be
careful
how
you
write
to
eugene
of
cornelia
graham
better
not
mention
her
name
at
all
if
she
lives
to
come
home
again
you
will
understand
me
is
not
her
health
good
asked
beulah
in
surprise
far
from
it
she
has
a
disease
of
the
heart
which
may
end
her
existence
any
moment
i
doubt
whether
she
ever
returns
to
america
mind
i
do
not
wish
you
to
speak
of
this
to
anyone
if
you
are
up
in
time
in
the
morning
i
wish
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
cut
some
of
the
choicest
flowers
in
the
greenhouse
and
arrange
a
handsome
bouquet
before
breakfast
i
want
to
take
it
to
one
of
my
patients
an
old
friend
of
my
mother
they
were
at
home
and
only
pausing
at
the
door
of
room
to
tell
the
good
woman
the
music
was
charming
beulah
hastened
to
her
own
apartment
throwing
herself
into
a
chair
she
recalled
the
incidents
of
the
evening
and
her
cheeks
burned
painfully
as
her
position
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
was
forced
upon
her
recollection
tears
of
mortification
rolled
over
her
hot
face
and
her
heart
throbbed
almost
to
suffocation
she
sank
upon
her
knees
and
tried
to
pray
but
sobs
choked
her
utterrance
and
leaning
her
head
against
the
bed
she
wept
bitterly
ah
is
there
not
pain
and
sorrow
and
evil
enough
in
this
fallen
world
of
ours
that
meddling
gossips
must
needs
poison
the
few
pure
springs
of
enjoyment
and
peace
not
the
hatred
of
the
theban
brothers
could
more
thoroughly
accomplish
this
fiendish
design
than
the
whisper
of
detraction
the
sneer
of
malice
or
the
fatal
innuendo
of
envious
tattlers
human
life
is
shielded
by
the
bulwark
of
legal
provisions
and
most
earthly
possessions
are
similarly
protected
but
there
are
assassins
whom
the
judicial
arm
can
not
reach
who
infest
society
in
countless
hordes
and
while
their
work
of
ruin
and
misery
goes
ever
on
there
is
for
the
unhappy
victims
no
redress
thy
holy
precepts
o
christ
alone
can
antidote
this
universal
evil
beulah
calmed
the
storm
that
raged
in
her
heart
and
as
she
took
the
flowers
from
her
hair
said
resolutely
before
long
i
shall
occupy
a
position
where
there
will
be
nothing
to
envy
and
then
possibly
i
may
escape
the
gossiping
rack
eugene
may
think
me
a
fool
if
he
likes
but
support
myself
i
will
if
it
costs
me
my
life
what
difference
should
it
make
to
him
so
long
as
i
prefer
it
one
more
year
of
study
and
i
shall
be
qualified
for
any
situation
then
i
can
breathe
freely
may
god
shield
me
from
all
harm
chapter
xvi
that
year
of
study
rolled
swiftly
away
another
winter
came
and
passed
another
spring
hung
its
verdant
drapery
over
earth
and
now
ardent
summer
reigned
once
more
it
was
near
the
noon
of
a
starry
july
night
that
beulah
sat
in
her
own
room
beside
her
a
manuscript
lay
before
her
yet
damp
with
ink
and
as
she
traced
the
concluding
words
and
threw
down
her
pen
a
triumphant
smile
flashed
over
her
face
the
session
of
the
public
school
would
close
with
an
examination
of
its
pupils
she
would
graduate
and
deliver
the
valedictory
to
the
graduating
class
she
had
just
finished
copying
her
address
and
placing
it
carefully
in
the
desk
rose
and
leaned
against
the
window
that
the
cool
night
air
might
fan
her
fevered
brow
the
hot
blood
beat
heavily
in
her
temples
and
fled
with
arrowy
swiftness
through
her
veins
continued
mental
excitement
like
another
shylock
peremptorily
exacted
its
debt
and
as
she
looked
out
on
the
solemn
beauty
of
the
night
instead
of
soothing
it
seemed
to
mock
her
restlessness
hartwell
had
been
absent
since
noon
but
now
she
detected
the
whir
of
wheels
in
the
direction
of
the
carriage
house
and
knew
that
he
was
in
the
study
she
heard
him
throw
open
the
shutters
and
speak
to
charon
and
gathering
up
her
hair
which
hung
loosely
about
her
shoulders
she
confined
it
with
a
comb
and
glided
noiselessly
down
the
steps
the
lamplight
gleamed
through
the
open
door
and
pausing
on
the
threshold
she
asked
may
i
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
or
are
you
too
much
fatigued
to
talk
beulah
i
positively
forbade
your
sitting
up
this
late
it
is
midnight
child
go
to
bed
he
held
some
papers
and
spoke
without
even
glancing
toward
her
yes
i
know
but
i
want
to
ask
you
something
before
i
sleep
well
what
is
it
still
he
did
not
look
up
from
his
papers
will
you
attend
the
exercises
is
it
a
matter
of
any
consequence
whether
i
do
or
not
to
me
sir
it
certainly
is
child
i
shall
not
have
leisure
be
honest
and
say
that
you
have
not
sufficient
interest
cried
she
passionately
he
smiled
and
answered
placidly
beulah
you
should
have
been
asleep
long
ago
her
lips
quivered
and
she
lingered
loath
to
leave
him
in
so
unfriendly
a
mood
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
looked
at
her
steadily
and
said
have
you
sent
in
your
name
as
an
applicant
for
a
situation
i
have
his
tone
was
stern
and
she
immediately
retreated
unable
to
sleep
she
passed
the
remaining
hours
of
the
short
night
in
pacing
the
floor
or
watching
the
clockwork
of
stars
point
to
the
coming
dawn
though
not
quite
eighteen
her
face
was
prematurely
grave
and
thoughtful
and
its
restless
unsatisfied
expression
plainly
discovered
a
perturbed
state
of
mind
and
heart
the
time
had
come
when
she
must
go
out
into
the
world
and
depend
only
upon
herself
and
though
she
was
anxious
to
commence
the
work
she
had
assigned
herself
she
shrank
from
the
thought
of
quitting
her
guardian
home
and
thus
losing
the
only
companionship
she
really
prized
he
had
not
sought
to
dissuade
her
had
appeared
perfectly
indifferent
to
her
plans
and
this
unconcern
had
wounded
her
deeply
would
decide
her
election
as
teacher
and
as
the
committee
would
be
present
at
her
examination
which
was
to
be
more
than
usually
minute
in
view
of
her
application
she
looked
forward
impatiently
to
this
occasion
morning
dawned
and
she
hailed
it
gladly
breakfast
came
and
she
took
hers
alone
the
doctor
had
already
gone
out
for
the
day
this
was
not
an
unusual
occurrence
yet
this
morning
she
noted
it
particularly
at
ten
the
academy
was
crowded
with
visitors
and
the
commissioners
and
teachers
were
formidably
arrayed
on
the
platform
raised
for
this
purpose
the
examination
began
greek
and
latin
classes
were
carefully
questioned
and
called
on
to
parse
and
scan
to
a
tiresome
extent
then
came
mathematical
demonstrations
every
conceivable
variety
of
lines
and
angles
adorned
the
blackboards
and
next
in
succession
were
classes
in
rhetoric
and
natural
history
there
was
a
tediousness
in
the
examinations
incident
to
such
occasions
and
as
repeated
inquiries
were
propounded
beulah
rejoiced
at
the
prospect
of
release
finally
the
commissioners
declared
themselves
quite
satisfied
with
the
proficiency
attained
and
the
graduating
class
read
the
compositions
for
the
day
at
length
at
a
signal
from
the
superintendent
of
the
department
beulah
ascended
the
platform
and
surrounded
by
men
signalized
by
scholarship
and
venerable
from
age
she
began
her
address
she
wore
a
white
mull
muslin
and
her
glossy
black
hair
was
arranged
with
the
severe
simplicity
which
characterized
her
style
of
dress
her
face
was
as
colorless
as
the
paper
she
held
and
her
voice
faltered
with
the
first
few
sentences
the
theme
was
female
heroism
and
as
she
sought
among
the
dusky
annals
of
the
past
for
instances
in
confirmation
of
her
predicate
that
female
intellect
was
capable
of
the
most
exalted
attainments
and
that
the
elements
of
her
character
would
enable
woman
to
cope
successfully
with
difficulties
of
every
class
her
voice
grew
clear
firm
and
deep
quitting
the
fertile
fields
of
history
she
painted
the
trials
which
hedge
woman
path
and
with
unerring
skill
defined
her
peculiar
sphere
her
true
position
the
reasoning
was
singularly
forcible
the
imagery
glowing
and
gorgeous
and
occasional
passages
of
exquisite
pathos
drew
tears
from
her
fascinated
audience
while
more
than
once
a
beautiful
burst
of
enthusiasm
was
received
with
flattering
applause
instead
of
flushing
her
face
grew
paler
and
the
large
eyes
were
full
of
lambent
light
which
seemed
to
flash
out
from
her
soul
in
conclusion
she
bade
adieu
to
the
honored
halls
where
her
feet
had
sought
the
paths
of
knowledge
paid
a
just
and
grateful
tribute
to
the
institution
of
public
schools
and
to
the
commissioners
through
whose
agency
she
had
been
enabled
to
enjoy
so
many
privileges
and
turning
to
her
touchingly
reminded
them
of
the
happy
past
and
warned
of
the
shrouded
future
crumpling
the
paper
in
one
hand
she
extended
the
other
toward
her
companions
and
in
thrilling
accents
conjured
them
in
any
and
every
emergency
to
prove
themselves
true
women
of
america
ornaments
of
the
social
circle
angel
guardians
of
the
sacred
hearthstone
ministering
spirits
where
suffering
and
want
demanded
succor
women
qualified
to
assist
in
a
council
of
statesmen
if
dire
necessity
ever
required
it
while
in
whatever
positions
they
might
be
placed
their
examples
should
remain
imperishable
monuments
of
true
female
heroism
as
the
last
words
passed
her
lips
she
glanced
swiftly
over
the
sea
of
heads
and
perceived
her
guardian
leaning
with
folded
arms
against
a
pillar
while
his
luminous
eyes
were
fastened
on
her
face
a
flash
of
joy
irradiated
her
countenance
and
bending
her
head
amid
the
applause
of
the
assembly
she
retired
to
her
seat
she
felt
that
her
triumph
was
complete
the
whispered
yet
audible
inquiries
regarding
her
name
the
admiring
curious
glances
directed
toward
her
were
not
necessary
to
assure
her
of
success
and
when
immediately
after
the
diplomas
were
distributed
she
rose
and
received
hers
with
the
calm
look
of
one
who
has
toiled
long
for
some
need
and
puts
forth
her
hand
for
what
she
is
conscious
of
having
deserved
the
crowd
slowly
dispersed
and
beckoned
forward
once
more
beulah
confronted
the
august
committee
whose
prerogative
it
was
to
elect
teachers
a
certificate
was
handed
her
and
the
chairman
informed
her
of
her
election
to
a
vacant
post
in
the
intermediate
department
the
salary
was
six
hundred
dollars
to
be
paid
monthly
and
her
duties
would
commence
with
the
opening
of
the
next
session
after
two
months
vacation
in
addition
he
congratulated
her
warmly
on
the
success
of
her
valedictory
effort
and
suggested
the
propriety
of
cultivating
talents
which
might
achieve
for
her
an
enviable
distinction
she
bowed
in
silence
and
turned
away
to
collect
her
books
her
guardian
approached
and
said
in
a
low
voice
put
on
your
bonnet
and
come
down
to
the
side
gate
it
is
too
warm
for
you
to
walk
home
without
waiting
for
her
answer
he
descended
the
steps
and
she
was
soon
seated
beside
him
in
the
buggy
the
short
ride
was
silent
and
on
reaching
home
beulah
would
have
gone
immediately
to
her
room
but
the
doctor
called
her
into
the
study
and
as
he
rang
the
bell
said
gently
you
look
very
much
exhausted
rest
here
while
i
order
a
glass
of
wine
it
was
speedily
brought
and
having
iced
it
he
held
it
to
her
white
lips
she
drank
the
contents
and
her
head
sank
on
the
sofa
cushions
the
fever
of
excitement
was
over
a
feeling
of
lassitude
stole
over
her
and
she
soon
lost
all
consciousness
in
a
heavy
sleep
the
sun
was
just
setting
as
she
awakened
from
her
slumber
and
sitting
up
she
soon
recalled
the
events
of
the
day
the
evening
breeze
laden
with
perfume
stole
in
refreshingly
through
the
blinds
and
as
the
sunset
pageant
faded
and
darkness
crept
on
she
remained
on
the
sofa
pondering
her
future
course
the
lamp
and
her
guardian
made
their
appearance
at
the
same
moment
and
throwing
himself
down
in
one
corner
of
the
sofa
the
latter
asked
how
are
you
since
your
nap
a
trifle
less
ghastly
i
see
much
better
thank
you
sir
my
head
is
quite
clear
again
clear
enough
to
make
out
a
foreign
letter
he
took
one
from
his
pocket
and
put
it
in
her
hand
an
anxious
look
flitted
across
her
face
and
she
glanced
rapidly
over
the
contents
then
crumpled
the
sheet
nervously
in
her
fingers
what
is
the
matter
now
he
is
coming
home
they
will
all
be
here
in
november
she
spoke
as
if
bitterly
chagrined
and
disappointed
most
people
would
consider
that
joyful
news
said
the
doctor
quietly
what
after
spending
more
than
five
years
one
of
them
in
traveling
to
come
back
without
having
acquired
a
profession
and
settle
down
into
a
mere
walking
ledger
to
have
princely
advantages
at
his
command
and
yet
throw
them
madly
to
the
winds
and
be
content
to
plod
along
the
road
of
mercantile
life
without
one
spark
of
ambition
when
his
mental
endowments
would
justify
his
aspiring
to
the
most
exalted
political
stations
in
the
land
her
voice
trembled
from
intensity
of
feeling
take
care
how
you
disparage
mercantile
pursuits
some
of
the
most
masterly
minds
of
the
age
were
nurtured
in
the
midst
of
ledgers
and
i
honor
and
reverence
all
such
far
more
than
their
colleagues
whose
wisdom
was
culled
in
classic
academic
halls
for
the
former
struggling
amid
adverse
circumstances
made
good
their
claim
to
an
exalted
place
in
the
temple
of
fame
but
necessity
forced
them
to
purely
mercantile
pursuits
eugene
case
is
by
no
means
analogous
situated
as
he
is
he
could
be
just
what
he
chose
i
honor
all
men
who
do
their
duty
nobly
and
truly
in
the
positions
fate
has
assigned
them
but
sir
you
know
there
are
some
more
richly
endowed
than
others
some
whom
nature
seems
to
have
destined
for
arduous
diplomatic
posts
whose
privilege
it
is
to
guide
the
helm
of
state
and
achieve
distinction
as
men
of
genius
to
such
the
call
will
be
imperative
america
needs
such
men
heaven
only
knows
where
they
are
to
rise
from
when
the
call
is
made
i
do
not
mean
to
disparage
mercantile
pursuits
they
afford
constant
opportunities
for
the
exercise
and
display
of
keenness
and
clearness
of
intellect
but
do
not
require
the
peculiar
gifts
so
essential
in
statesmen
indolence
is
unpardonable
in
any
avocation
and
i
would
be
commended
to
the
industrious
energetic
merchant
in
preference
to
superficial
called
men
but
eugene
had
rare
educational
advantages
and
i
expected
him
to
improve
them
and
be
something
more
than
ordinary
he
expected
it
five
years
ago
what
infatuation
possesses
him
latterly
i
can
not
imagine
hartwell
smiled
and
said
very
quietly
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
you
might
have
overestimated
eugene
abilities
sir
you
entertained
a
flattering
opinion
of
them
when
he
left
here
she
could
animadvert
upon
his
fickleness
but
did
not
choose
that
others
should
enjoy
the
same
privilege
i
by
no
means
considered
him
an
embryo
webster
or
calhoun
never
looked
on
him
as
an
intellectual
prodigy
he
had
a
good
mind
a
handsome
face
and
frank
gentlemanly
manners
which
in
the
aggregate
impressed
me
favorably
beulah
bit
her
lips
and
stooped
to
pat
charon
head
there
was
silence
for
some
moments
and
then
the
doctor
asked
does
he
mention
cornelia
health
only
once
incidentally
i
judge
from
the
sentence
that
she
is
rather
feeble
there
is
a
good
deal
of
unimportant
chat
about
a
lady
they
have
met
in
florence
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
louisiana
planter
very
beautiful
and
fascinating
is
a
niece
of
graham
and
will
spend
part
of
next
winter
with
the
grahams
what
is
her
name
antoinette
dupres
beulah
was
still
caressing
charon
and
did
not
observe
the
purplish
glow
which
bathed
the
doctor
face
at
the
mention
of
the
name
she
only
saw
that
he
rose
abruptly
and
walked
to
the
window
where
he
stood
until
tea
was
brought
in
as
they
concluded
the
meal
and
left
the
table
he
held
out
his
hand
beulah
i
congratulate
you
on
your
signal
success
your
valedictory
made
me
proud
of
my
protegee
she
had
put
her
hand
in
his
and
looked
up
in
his
face
but
the
cloudy
splendor
of
the
eyes
was
more
than
she
could
bear
and
drooping
her
head
a
little
she
answered
thank
you
you
have
vacation
for
two
months
yes
sir
and
then
my
duties
commence
here
is
the
certificate
of
my
election
she
offered
it
for
inspection
but
without
noticing
it
he
continued
beulah
i
think
you
owe
me
something
for
taking
care
of
you
as
you
phrased
it
long
ago
at
the
asylum
do
you
admit
the
debt
most
gratefully
sir
i
admit
that
i
can
never
liquidate
it
i
can
repay
you
only
with
the
most
earnest
gratitude
large
tears
hung
upon
her
lashes
and
with
an
uncontrollable
impulse
she
raised
his
hand
to
her
lips
i
am
about
to
test
the
sincerity
of
your
gratitude
i
doubt
it
she
trembled
and
looked
at
mm
uneasily
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
said
slowly
relinquish
the
idea
of
teaching
let
me
present
you
to
society
as
my
adopted
child
thus
you
can
requite
the
debt
i
can
not
i
can
not
cried
beulah
firmly
though
tears
gushed
over
her
cheeks
can
not
can
not
repeated
the
doctor
pressing
heavily
upon
her
shoulders
will
not
then
said
she
proudly
they
looked
at
each
other
steadily
a
withering
smile
of
scorn
and
bitterness
distorted
his
features
and
he
pushed
her
from
him
saying
in
the
deep
concentrated
tone
of
intense
disappointment
i
might
have
known
it
i
might
have
expected
it
for
fate
has
always
decreed
me
just
such
returns
leaning
against
the
sculptured
niobe
which
stood
near
beulah
exclaimed
in
a
voice
of
great
anguish
oh
hartwell
do
not
make
me
repent
the
day
i
entered
this
house
god
knows
i
am
grateful
very
grateful
for
your
unparalleled
kindness
oh
that
it
were
in
my
power
to
prove
to
you
my
gratitude
do
not
upbraid
me
you
knew
that
i
came
here
only
to
be
educated
even
then
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
always
imposing
on
your
generosity
and
every
day
that
passed
strengthened
this
impatience
of
dependence
through
your
kindness
it
is
now
in
my
power
to
maintain
myself
and
after
the
opening
of
next
session
i
can
not
remain
any
longer
the
recipient
of
your
bounty
oh
sir
do
not
charge
me
with
ingratitude
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
more
than
i
can
bear
mark
me
beulah
your
pride
will
wreck
you
wreck
your
happiness
your
peace
of
mind
already
its
iron
hand
is
crushing
your
young
heart
beware
lest
in
yielding
to
its
decrees
you
become
the
hopeless
being
a
similar
course
has
rendered
me
beware
but
why
should
i
warn
you
have
not
my
prophecies
ever
proved
cassandran
leave
me
no
i
will
not
leave
you
in
anger
she
drew
near
him
and
took
his
hand
in
both
hers
the
fingers
were
cold
and
white
as
marble
rigid
and
inflexible
as
steel
my
guardian
would
you
have
me
take
a
step
through
fear
of
your
displeasure
which
would
render
my
life
a
burden
will
you
urge
me
to
remain
when
i
tell
you
that
i
can
not
be
happy
here
i
think
not
urge
you
to
remain
by
the
furies
no
i
urge
you
to
go
yes
go
i
no
longer
want
you
here
your
presence
would
irritate
me
beyond
measure
but
listen
to
me
i
am
going
to
new
york
on
business
had
intended
taking
you
with
me
but
since
you
are
so
stubbornly
proud
i
can
consent
to
leave
you
i
shall
start
evening
rather
earlier
than
i
expected
and
shall
not
return
before
september
perhaps
even
later
what
your
plans
are
i
shall
not
inquire
but
it
is
my
request
that
you
remain
in
this
house
under
care
until
your
school
duties
commence
then
you
will
i
suppose
remove
elsewhere
i
also
request
particularly
that
you
will
not
hesitate
to
use
the
contents
of
a
purse
which
i
shall
leave
on
my
desk
for
you
remember
that
in
coming
years
when
trials
assail
you
if
you
need
a
friend
i
will
still
assist
you
you
will
leave
me
now
if
you
please
as
i
have
some
letters
to
write
he
motioned
her
away
and
unable
to
frame
any
reply
she
left
the
room
though
utterly
miserable
now
that
her
guardian
seemed
so
completely
estranged
her
proud
nature
rebelled
at
his
stern
dismissal
and
a
feeling
of
reckless
defiance
speedily
dried
the
tears
on
her
cheek
that
he
should
look
down
upon
her
with
scornful
indifference
stung
her
almost
to
desperation
and
she
resolved
instead
of
weeping
to
meet
and
part
with
him
as
coldly
as
his
contemptuous
treatment
justified
weary
in
mind
and
body
she
fell
asleep
and
soon
forgot
all
her
plans
and
sorrows
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
when
harriet
waked
her
and
starting
up
she
asked
what
time
is
it
how
came
i
to
sleep
so
late
it
is
eight
master
ate
breakfast
an
hour
ago
look
here
child
what
is
to
pay
master
is
going
off
to
the
north
to
be
gone
till
october
he
sat
up
all
night
writing
and
giving
orders
about
things
on
the
place
the
greenhouse
and
the
flower
seeds
to
be
saved
in
the
front
yard
he
has
not
been
in
such
a
way
since
seven
years
ago
what
is
in
the
wind
now
what
ails
him
harriet
sat
with
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
wrinkled
face
resting
in
the
palms
of
her
hands
she
looked
puzzled
and
discontented
he
told
me
last
night
that
he
expected
to
leave
home
this
evening
that
he
was
going
to
new
york
on
business
beulah
affected
indifference
but
the
searching
eyes
of
the
old
woman
were
fixed
on
her
and
as
she
turned
away
harriet
exclaimed
going
this
evening
why
child
he
has
gone
told
us
all
from
watson
down
to
charon
said
his
trunk
must
be
sent
down
to
the
wharf
at
three
that
he
would
not
have
time
to
come
home
again
there
good
gracious
you
are
as
white
as
a
sheet
i
will
fetch
you
some
wine
she
hurried
out
and
beulah
sank
into
a
chair
stunned
by
the
intelligence
when
harriet
proffered
a
glass
of
cordial
she
declined
it
and
said
composedly
i
will
come
after
a
while
and
take
my
breakfast
there
is
no
accounting
for
your
master
movements
i
would
as
soon
engage
to
keep
up
with
a
comet
there
let
go
my
dress
i
am
going
into
the
study
for
a
while
she
went
slowly
down
the
steps
and
locking
the
door
of
the
study
to
prevent
intrusion
looked
around
the
room
there
was
an
air
of
confusion
as
though
books
and
chairs
had
been
hastily
moved
about
on
the
floor
lay
numerous
shreds
of
crape
and
glancing
up
she
saw
with
surprise
that
the
portrait
had
been
closely
wrapped
in
a
sheet
and
suspended
with
the
face
to
the
wall
instantly
an
uncontrollable
desire
seized
her
to
look
at
that
face
she
had
always
supposed
it
to
be
his
wife
likeness
and
longed
to
gaze
upon
the
features
of
one
whose
name
her
husband
had
never
mentioned
the
mantel
was
low
and
standing
on
a
chair
she
endeavored
to
catch
the
cord
which
supported
the
frame
but
it
hung
too
high
she
stood
on
the
marble
mantel
and
stretched
her
hands
eagerly
up
but
though
her
fingers
touched
the
cord
she
could
not
disengage
it
from
the
hook
and
with
a
sensation
of
keen
disappointment
she
was
forced
to
abandon
the
attempt
a
note
on
the
desk
attracted
her
attention
it
was
directed
to
her
and
contained
only
a
few
words
accompanying
this
is
a
purse
containing
a
hundred
dollars
in
any
emergency
which
the
future
may
present
do
not
hesitate
to
call
on
your
guardian
she
laid
her
head
down
on
his
desk
and
sobbed
bitterly
for
the
first
time
she
realized
that
he
had
indeed
gone
gone
without
one
word
of
adieu
one
look
of
kindness
or
reconciliation
her
tortured
heart
whispered
write
him
a
note
ask
him
to
come
home
tell
him
you
will
not
leave
his
house
but
pride
answered
he
is
a
tyrant
do
be
grieved
at
his
indifference
he
is
nothing
to
you
go
to
work
boldly
and
repay
the
money
you
have
cost
him
once
more
as
in
former
years
a
feeling
of
desolation
crept
over
her
she
had
rejected
her
guardian
request
and
isolated
herself
from
sympathy
for
who
would
assist
and
sympathize
with
her
mental
difficulties
as
he
had
done
the
tears
froze
in
her
eyes
and
she
sat
for
some
time
looking
at
the
crumpled
note
gradually
an
expression
of
proud
defiance
settled
on
her
features
she
took
the
purse
walked
up
to
her
room
and
put
on
her
bonnet
and
mantle
descending
to
the
breakfast
room
she
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
and
telling
watson
she
would
be
absent
an
hour
or
two
left
the
house
and
proceeded
to
madam
cymon
she
asked
to
see
miss
sanders
and
after
waiting
a
few
minutes
in
the
parlor
clara
made
her
appearance
she
looked
wan
and
weary
but
greeted
her
friend
with
a
gentle
smile
i
heard
of
your
triumph
yesterday
beulah
and
most
sincerely
congratulate
you
i
am
in
no
mood
for
congratulations
just
now
clara
did
not
you
tell
me
a
few
days
since
that
the
music
teacher
of
this
establishment
was
ill
and
that
madam
cymon
was
anxious
to
procure
another
yes
i
have
no
idea
she
will
ever
be
well
again
if
strong
enough
she
is
going
back
to
her
family
in
philadelphia
next
week
why
do
you
ask
i
want
to
get
the
situation
and
wish
you
would
say
to
madam
that
i
have
called
to
see
her
about
it
i
will
wait
here
till
you
speak
to
her
beulah
are
you
mad
hartwell
never
will
consent
to
your
teaching
music
cried
clara
with
astonishment
written
on
every
feature
hartwell
is
not
my
master
clara
sanders
will
you
speak
to
madam
or
shall
i
have
to
do
it
certainly
i
will
speak
to
her
but
oh
beulah
are
you
wild
enough
to
leave
your
present
home
for
such
a
life
i
have
been
elected
a
teacher
in
the
public
schools
but
shall
have
nothing
to
do
until
the
first
of
october
in
the
meantime
i
intend
to
give
music
lessons
if
madam
will
employ
me
for
two
months
she
may
be
able
to
procure
a
professor
by
the
opening
of
the
next
term
and
further
if
i
can
make
this
arrangement
i
am
coming
immediately
to
board
with
hoyt
now
speak
to
madam
for
me
will
you
one
moment
more
does
the
doctor
know
of
all
this
he
knows
that
i
intend
to
teach
in
the
public
school
he
goes
to
new
york
this
afternoon
clara
looked
at
her
mournfully
and
said
with
sad
emphasis
oh
beulah
you
may
live
to
rue
your
rashness
to
madam
cymon
the
proposal
was
singularly
opportune
and
hastening
to
meet
the
applicant
she
expressed
much
pleasure
at
seeing
miss
benton
again
she
was
very
anxious
to
procure
a
teacher
for
the
young
ladies
boarding
with
her
and
for
her
own
daughters
and
the
limited
engagement
would
suit
very
well
she
desired
however
to
hear
miss
benton
perform
beulah
took
off
her
gloves
and
played
several
very
difficult
pieces
with
the
ease
which
only
constant
practice
and
skillful
training
can
confer
madam
declared
herself
more
than
satisfied
with
her
proficiency
and
requested
her
to
commence
her
instructions
on
the
following
day
she
had
given
the
former
teacher
six
hundred
dollars
a
year
and
would
allow
miss
benton
eighty
dollars
for
the
two
months
beulah
was
agreeably
surprised
at
the
ample
remuneration
and
having
arranged
the
hours
of
her
attendance
at
the
school
she
took
leave
of
the
principal
clara
called
to
her
as
she
reached
the
street
and
assuming
a
gayety
which
just
then
was
very
foreign
to
her
real
feelings
beulah
answered
it
is
all
arranged
i
shall
take
tea
with
you
in
my
new
home
provided
hoyt
can
give
me
a
room
she
kissed
her
hand
and
hurried
away
hoyt
found
no
difficulty
in
providing
a
room
and
to
beulah
great
joy
managed
to
have
a
vacant
one
adjoining
clara
she
was
a
gentle
warmhearted
woman
and
as
beulah
examined
the
apartment
and
inquired
the
terms
she
hesitated
and
said
my
terms
are
thirty
dollars
a
month
but
you
are
poor
i
judge
and
being
miss
clara
friend
i
will
only
charge
you
i
do
not
wish
you
to
make
any
deduction
in
my
favor
i
will
take
the
room
at
thirty
dollars
answered
beulah
rather
haughtily
very
well
when
will
you
want
it
immediately
be
kind
enough
to
have
it
in
readiness
for
me
i
shall
come
this
afternoon
could
you
give
me
some
window
curtains
i
should
like
it
better
if
you
could
do
so
without
much
inconvenience
oh
certainly
they
were
taken
down
yesterday
to
be
washed
everything
shall
be
in
order
for
you
it
was
too
warm
to
walk
home
again
and
beulah
called
a
carriage
the
driver
had
not
proceeded
far
when
a
press
of
vehicles
forced
him
to
pause
a
few
minutes
they
happened
to
stand
near
the
post
office
and
as
beulah
glanced
at
the
eager
crowd
collected
in
front
she
started
violently
on
perceiving
her
guardian
he
stood
on
the
corner
talking
to
a
gentleman
of
venerable
aspect
and
she
saw
that
he
looked
harassed
she
was
powerfully
impelled
to
beckon
him
to
her
and
at
least
obtain
a
friendly
adieu
but
again
pride
prevailed
he
had
deliberately
left
her
without
saying
and
she
would
not
force
herself
on
his
notice
even
as
she
dropped
her
veil
to
avoid
observation
the
carriage
rolled
on
and
she
was
soon
at
hartwell
door
unwilling
to
reflect
on
the
steps
she
had
taken
she
busied
herself
in
packing
her
clothes
and
books
on
every
side
were
tokens
of
her
guardian
constant
interest
and
remembrance
pictures
vases
and
all
the
elegant
appendages
of
a
at
length
the
last
book
was
stowed
avay
and
nothing
else
remained
to
engage
her
the
beautiful
little
nuremberg
clock
on
the
mantel
struck
two
and
looking
up
she
saw
the
solemn
face
of
harriet
who
was
standing
in
the
door
her
steady
wondering
gaze
disconcerted
beulah
despite
her
assumed
indifference
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
commotion
hal
says
you
ordered
the
carriage
to
be
ready
at
five
to
take
you
away
from
here
oh
child
what
are
things
coming
to
what
will
master
say
what
he
say
what
are
you
quitting
this
house
for
where
you
have
been
treated
as
well
as
if
it
belonged
to
you
what
ails
you
nothing
i
have
always
intended
to
leave
here
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
support
myself
i
can
do
so
now
very
easily
and
am
going
to
board
your
master
knows
i
intend
to
teach
but
he
has
no
idea
that
you
are
going
to
leave
here
before
he
comes
home
for
he
gave
us
all
express
orders
to
see
that
you
had
just
what
you
wanted
oh
he
will
be
in
a
tearing
rage
when
he
hears
of
it
do
anger
him
child
do
pray
for
mercy
sake
do
anger
him
he
never
forgets
anything
when
he
once
sets
his
head
he
is
worse
than
david
or
the
philistines
if
he
is
willing
to
support
you
it
is
his
own
lookout
he
is
able
and
his
money
is
his
own
his
kin
wo
get
it
he
and
his
brother
do
speak
and
as
for
miss
may
they
never
did
get
along
in
peace
even
before
he
was
married
so
if
he
chooses
to
give
some
of
his
fortune
to
you
it
is
business
but
his
own
and
you
are
mighty
simple
i
can
tell
you
if
you
do
stay
here
and
take
it
that
will
do
harriet
i
do
not
wish
any
more
advice
i
do
want
your
master
fortune
even
if
i
had
the
offer
of
it
i
am
determined
to
make
my
own
living
so
just
say
no
more
about
it
take
care
child
remember
goeth
before
a
fall
what
do
you
mean
cried
beulah
angrily
i
mean
that
the
day
is
coming
when
you
will
be
glad
enough
to
come
back
and
let
my
master
take
care
of
you
that
what
i
mean
and
see
if
it
does
come
to
pass
but
he
will
not
do
it
then
i
tell
you
now
he
wo
there
is
no
forgiving
spirit
about
him
he
is
as
fierce
and
bears
malice
as
long
as
a
comanche
injun
it
is
no
business
of
mine
though
i
have
said
my
say
and
i
will
be
bound
you
will
go
your
own
gait
you
are
just
about
as
as
he
is
himself
anybody
would
almost
believe
you
belonged
to
the
hartwell
family
every
soul
of
them
is
alike
in
the
matter
of
temper
only
miss
pauline
has
something
of
her
pa
disposition
i
suppose
now
her
ma
is
married
again
she
will
want
to
come
back
to
her
uncle
should
not
wonder
if
he
her
since
you
have
got
the
bit
between
your
teeth
i
hope
he
will
answered
beulah
she
ill
brooked
harriet
plain
speech
but
remembrances
of
past
affection
checked
the
severe
rebuke
which
more
than
once
rose
to
her
lips
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
and
harriet
walked
off
with
anything
but
a
placid
expression
of
countenance
while
beulah
sought
watson
to
explain
her
sudden
departure
and
acquaint
her
with
her
plans
for
the
summer
the
housekeeper
endeavored
most
earnestly
to
dissuade
her
from
taking
the
contemplated
step
assuring
her
that
the
doctor
would
be
grieved
and
displeased
but
her
arguments
produced
no
effect
and
with
tears
of
regret
she
bade
her
farewell
the
sun
was
setting
when
beulah
took
possession
of
her
room
at
hoyt
house
the
furniture
was
very
plain
and
the
want
of
several
articles
vividly
recalled
the
luxurious
home
she
had
abandoned
she
unpacked
and
arranged
her
clothes
and
piled
her
books
on
a
small
table
which
was
the
only
substitute
for
her
beautiful
desk
and
elegant
rosewood
bookcase
she
had
gathered
a
superb
bouquet
of
flowers
as
she
crossed
the
front
yard
and
in
lieu
of
her
sevres
vases
placed
them
in
a
tumbler
which
stood
on
the
tall
narrow
mantelpiece
her
room
was
in
the
third
story
with
two
windows
one
opening
to
the
south
and
one
to
the
west
it
grew
dark
by
the
time
she
had
arranged
the
furniture
and
too
weary
to
think
of
going
down
to
tea
she
unbound
her
hair
and
took
a
seat
beside
the
window
the
prospect
was
extended
below
her
were
countless
lamps
marking
the
principal
streets
and
in
the
distance
the
dark
cloud
of
masts
told
that
river
and
bay
might
be
distinctly
seen
by
daylight
the
quiet
stars
looked
dim
through
the
dusty
atmosphere
and
the
noise
of
numerous
vehicles
rattling
by
produced
a
confused
impression
such
as
she
had
never
before
received
at
this
usually
calm
twilight
season
the
events
of
the
day
passed
in
a
swift
review
and
a
mighty
barrier
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
as
by
some
foul
spell
between
her
guardian
and
herself
what
an
immeasurable
gulf
now
yawned
to
separate
them
could
it
be
possible
that
the
friendly
relations
of
years
were
thus
suddenly
and
irrevocably
annulled
would
he
relinquish
all
interest
in
one
whom
he
had
so
long
watched
over
and
directed
did
he
intend
that
they
should
be
completely
estranged
henceforth
for
the
first
time
since
death
she
felt
herself
thrown
upon
the
world
alone
and
unaided
she
was
essaying
to
carve
her
own
fortune
from
the
huge
quarries
where
thousands
were
diligently
laboring
an
undefinable
feeling
of
desolation
crept
into
her
heart
but
she
struggled
desperately
against
it
and
asked
in
proud
defiance
of
her
own
nature
am
i
not
sufficient
unto
myself
leaning
only
on
myself
what
more
should
i
want
nothing
his
sympathy
is
utterly
unnecessary
a
knock
at
the
door
startled
her
and
in
answer
to
her
come
in
clara
sanders
entered
she
walked
slowly
and
seating
herself
beside
beulah
said
in
a
gentle
but
weary
tone
how
do
you
like
your
room
i
am
so
glad
it
opens
into
mine
quite
as
well
as
i
expected
the
view
from
this
window
must
be
very
fine
there
is
the
i
suppose
are
you
not
going
down
i
am
too
much
fatigued
to
move
no
i
never
want
supper
and
generally
spend
the
evenings
in
my
room
it
is
drearily
monotonous
here
nothing
to
vary
the
routine
for
me
except
my
afternoon
walk
and
recently
the
warm
weather
has
debarred
me
even
from
that
you
are
a
great
walker
i
believe
and
i
look
forward
to
many
pleasant
rambles
with
you
when
i
feel
stronger
and
autumn
comes
beulah
how
long
does
hartwell
expect
to
remain
at
the
north
he
told
me
some
time
ago
that
he
was
a
delegate
to
the
medical
convention
i
believe
it
is
rather
uncertain
but
probably
he
will
not
return
before
october
indeed
that
is
a
long
time
for
a
physician
to
absent
himself
just
then
an
paused
on
the
pavement
beneath
the
window
and
began
a
beautiful
air
from
sonnambula
it
was
a
favorite
song
of
beulah
and
as
the
melancholy
tones
swelled
on
the
night
air
they
recalled
many
happy
hours
spent
in
the
quiet
study
beside
the
melodeon
she
leaned
out
of
the
window
till
the
last
echo
died
away
and
as
the
musician
shouldered
his
instrument
and
trudged
off
she
said
abruptly
is
there
not
a
piano
in
the
house
yes
just
such
a
one
as
you
might
expect
to
find
in
a
boarding
house
where
unruly
children
are
thrumming
upon
it
from
morning
till
night
it
was
once
a
fine
instrument
but
now
is
only
capable
of
excruciating
discords
you
will
miss
your
grand
piano
i
must
have
something
in
my
own
room
to
practice
on
perhaps
i
can
hire
a
melodeon
or
piano
for
a
moderate
sum
i
will
try
the
grahams
are
coming
home
soon
i
hear
one
of
the
principal
upholsterers
boards
here
and
he
mentioned
this
morning
at
breakfast
that
he
had
received
a
letter
from
graham
directing
him
to
attend
to
the
unpacking
of
an
entirely
new
set
of
furniture
everything
will
be
on
a
grand
scale
i
suppose
eugene
returns
with
them
yes
they
will
all
arrive
in
november
it
must
be
a
delightful
anticipation
for
you
why
so
pray
why
because
you
and
euguene
are
such
old
friends
oh
yes
as
far
as
eugene
is
concerned
of
course
it
is
a
very
pleasant
anticipation
he
is
identified
with
the
grahams
not
necessarily
answered
beulah
coldly
a
sad
smile
flitted
over
clara
sweet
face
as
she
rose
and
kissed
her
friend
brow
saying
gently
dear
i
have
a
headache
and
must
try
to
sleep
it
off
since
you
have
determined
to
battle
with
difficulties
i
am
very
glad
to
have
you
here
with
me
i
earnestly
hope
that
success
may
crown
your
efforts
and
the
sunshine
of
happiness
dispel
for
you
the
shadows
that
have
fallen
thick
about
my
pathway
you
have
been
rash
beulah
and
but
i
trust
that
all
will
prove
for
the
best
she
glided
away
and
locking
the
door
beulah
returned
to
her
seat
and
laid
her
head
wearily
down
on
the
what
a
hermes
is
thought
like
a
vanishing
dream
fled
the
consciousness
of
surrounding
objects
and
she
was
with
eugene
now
in
the
earlier
years
of
his
absence
she
was
in
heidelberg
listening
to
the
evening
chimes
and
rambling
with
him
through
the
heart
of
the
odenwald
then
they
explored
the
hartz
climbed
the
brocken
and
there
among
the
clouds
discussed
the
adventures
of
faust
and
his
kinsman
manfred
anon
the
arrival
of
the
grahams
disturbed
the
quiet
of
eugene
life
and
far
away
from
the
picturesque
haunts
of
heidelberg
students
he
wandered
with
them
over
italy
switzerland
and
france
engrossed
by
these
companions
he
no
longer
found
time
to
commune
with
her
and
when
occasionally
he
penned
a
short
letter
it
was
hurried
constrained
and
unsatisfactory
one
topic
had
become
stereotyped
he
never
failed
to
discourage
the
idea
of
teaching
urged
most
earnestly
the
folly
of
such
a
step
and
dwelt
upon
the
numerous
advantages
of
social
position
arising
from
a
residence
under
her
guardian
roof
we
have
seen
that
from
the
hour
of
lilly
departure
from
the
asylum
beulah
affections
hopes
pride
all
centered
in
eugene
there
had
long
existed
a
tacit
compact
which
led
her
to
consider
her
future
indissolubly
linked
with
his
and
his
parting
words
seemed
to
seal
this
compact
as
holy
and
binding
when
he
declared
i
mean
of
course
to
take
care
of
you
myself
when
i
come
home
for
you
know
you
belong
to
me
his
letters
for
many
months
retained
the
tone
of
dictatorship
but
the
tenderness
seemed
all
to
have
melted
away
he
wrote
as
if
with
a
heart
preoccupied
by
weightier
matters
and
now
beulah
could
no
longer
conceal
from
herself
the
painful
fact
that
the
man
was
far
different
from
the
boy
after
five
years
absence
he
was
coming
back
a
man
engrossed
by
other
thoughts
and
feelings
than
those
which
had
prompted
him
in
days
gone
by
with
the
tenacious
hope
of
youth
she
still
trusted
that
she
might
have
misjudged
him
he
could
never
be
other
than
noble
and
generous
she
would
silence
her
forebodings
and
wait
till
his
return
she
wished
beyond
all
expression
to
see
him
once
more
and
the
prospect
of
a
speedy
reunion
often
made
her
heart
throb
painfully
that
he
would
reproach
her
for
her
obstinate
resolution
of
teaching
she
was
prepared
to
expect
but
strong
in
the
consciousness
of
duty
she
committed
herself
to
the
care
of
a
merciful
god
and
soon
slept
as
soundly
as
though
under
hartwell
roof
chapter
xvii
sometimes
after
sitting
for
five
consecutive
hours
at
the
piano
guiding
the
clumsy
fingers
of
tyros
and
listening
to
a
tiresome
round
of
scales
and
exercises
beulah
felt
exhausted
mentally
and
physically
and
feared
that
she
had
miserably
overrated
her
powers
of
endurance
the
long
warm
days
of
august
dragged
heavily
by
and
each
night
she
felt
grateful
that
the
summer
was
one
day
nearer
its
grave
one
afternoon
she
proposed
to
clara
to
extend
their
walk
to
the
home
of
her
guardian
and
as
she
readily
assented
they
left
the
noise
and
crowd
of
the
city
and
soon
found
themselves
on
the
common
this
is
my
birthday
said
beulah
as
they
passed
a
clump
of
pines
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
white
gate
beyond
ah
how
old
are
you
eighteen
but
i
feel
much
older
she
opened
the
gate
and
as
they
leisurely
ascended
the
avenue
of
aged
cedars
beulah
felt
once
more
as
if
she
were
going
home
a
fierce
bark
greeted
her
and
the
next
moment
charon
rushed
to
meet
her
placing
his
huge
paws
on
her
shoulders
and
whining
and
barking
joyfully
he
bounded
before
her
to
the
steps
and
lay
down
contentedly
on
the
piazza
harriet
turbaned
head
appeared
at
the
entrance
and
a
smile
of
welcome
lighted
up
her
ebon
face
as
she
shook
beulah
hand
watson
was
absent
and
after
a
few
questions
beulah
entered
the
study
saying
i
want
some
books
harriet
and
miss
sanders
wishes
to
see
the
paintings
ah
every
chair
and
greeted
her
like
dear
friends
and
she
bent
down
over
some
volumes
to
hide
the
tears
that
sprang
into
her
eyes
the
only
really
happy
portion
of
her
life
had
been
passed
here
every
article
in
the
room
was
dear
from
association
and
though
only
a
month
had
elapsed
since
her
departure
those
bygone
years
seemed
far
far
off
among
the
mist
of
very
distant
recollections
thick
and
fast
fell
the
hot
drops
until
her
eyes
were
blinded
and
she
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
print
they
were
riveted
on
the
memory
of
kind
smiles
haunted
her
and
kinder
tones
seemed
borne
to
her
from
every
corner
of
the
apartment
clara
was
eagerly
examining
the
paintings
and
neither
of
the
girls
observed
harriet
entrance
until
she
asked
do
you
know
that
the
yellow
fever
has
broke
out
here
oh
you
are
mistaken
it
ca
be
possible
cried
clara
turning
pale
i
tell
you
it
is
a
fact
there
are
six
cases
now
at
the
hospital
hal
was
there
this
morning
i
have
lived
here
a
good
many
years
and
from
the
signs
i
think
we
are
going
to
have
dreadfully
sickly
times
you
young
ladies
had
better
keep
out
of
the
sun
first
thing
you
know
you
will
have
it
who
told
you
there
was
yellow
fever
at
the
hospital
asbury
said
so
and
what
is
more
hal
has
had
it
himself
and
nursed
people
who
had
it
and
he
says
it
is
the
worst
sort
of
yellow
fever
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
said
beulah
looking
up
for
the
first
time
i
am
dreadfully
afraid
of
it
answered
clara
with
a
nervous
shudder
then
you
had
better
leave
town
as
quick
as
possible
for
folks
who
are
easily
scared
always
catch
it
soonest
nonsense
cried
beulah
noting
the
deepening
pallor
of
face
oh
i
will
warrant
if
everybody
else
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
city
takes
it
you
wo
miss
beulah
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
are
afraid
of
muttered
harriet
scanning
the
countenance
and
adding
in
a
louder
tone
have
you
heard
anything
from
master
no
beulah
bit
her
lips
to
conceal
her
emotion
hal
hears
from
him
he
was
in
new
york
when
he
wrote
the
last
letter
she
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
thus
torturing
her
visitor
and
determined
not
to
gratify
her
by
any
manifestation
of
interest
or
curiosity
beulah
took
up
a
couple
of
volumes
and
turned
to
the
door
saying
come
clara
you
must
each
have
a
bouquet
harriet
where
are
the
flower
scissors
hartwell
never
objected
to
my
carefully
cutting
even
his
choicest
flowers
there
clara
listen
to
the
cool
rippling
of
the
fountain
how
i
have
longed
to
hear
its
silvery
murmur
once
more
they
went
out
into
the
front
yard
clara
wandered
about
the
flower
beds
gathering
blossoms
which
were
scattered
in
lavish
profusion
on
all
sides
and
leaning
over
the
marble
basin
beulah
bathed
her
brow
in
the
crystal
waters
there
were
bewitching
beauty
and
serenity
in
the
scene
before
her
and
as
charon
nestled
his
great
head
against
her
hand
she
found
it
very
difficult
to
realize
the
fact
that
she
had
left
this
lovely
retreat
for
the
small
room
at
hoyt
boarding
house
it
was
not
her
habit
however
to
indulge
in
repinings
and
though
her
ardent
appreciation
of
beauty
rendered
the
place
incalculably
dear
to
her
she
resolutely
gathered
a
cluster
of
flowers
bade
adieu
to
harriet
and
descended
the
avenue
charon
walked
soberly
beside
her
now
and
then
looking
up
as
if
to
inquire
the
meaning
of
her
long
absence
and
wonder
at
her
sudden
departure
at
the
gate
she
patted
him
affectionately
on
the
head
and
passed
out
he
made
no
attempt
to
follow
her
but
barked
violently
and
then
lay
down
at
the
gate
whining
mournfully
poor
charon
i
wish
i
might
have
him
said
she
sadly
i
dare
say
the
doctor
would
give
him
to
you
answered
clara
very
simply
i
would
just
as
soon
think
of
asking
him
for
his
own
head
replied
beulah
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
beulah
how
you
can
feel
so
coldly
toward
dr
hartwell
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
you
mean
by
that
said
beulah
involuntarily
crushing
the
flowers
she
held
why
you
speak
of
him
just
as
you
would
of
anybody
else
well
you
seem
to
be
afraid
of
him
to
a
certain
extent
i
am
and
so
is
everybody
else
who
knows
him
intimately
this
fear
is
unjust
to
him
how
so
pray
because
he
is
too
noble
to
do
aught
to
inspire
it
certainly
he
is
feared
nevertheless
by
all
who
know
him
well
it
seems
to
me
that
situated
as
you
have
been
you
would
almost
worship
him
i
am
not
addicted
to
worshiping
anything
but
god
answered
beulah
shortly
you
are
an
odd
compound
beulah
sometimes
i
think
you
must
be
utterly
heartless
thank
you
do
be
hurt
but
you
are
so
cold
so
freezing
you
chill
me
do
i
hartwell
your
delphic
oracle
it
seems
says
i
am
as
fierce
as
a
tropical
tornado
i
do
not
understand
how
you
can
bear
to
give
up
such
an
enchanting
home
and
go
to
hard
work
as
if
you
were
driven
to
it
from
necessity
do
not
go
over
all
that
beaten
track
again
if
you
please
it
is
not
my
home
i
can
be
just
as
happy
nay
happier
in
my
little
room
i
doubt
it
said
clara
pertinaciously
stopping
suddenly
and
fixing
her
eyes
steadily
on
her
companion
beulah
hastily
asked
clara
sanders
why
should
you
care
if
my
guardian
and
i
are
separated
a
burning
blush
dyed
cheek
and
brow
as
clara
drooped
her
head
and
answered
because
he
is
my
friend
also
and
i
know
that
your
departure
will
grieve
him
you
overestimate
my
worth
and
his
interest
he
is
a
man
who
lives
in
a
world
of
his
own
and
needs
no
society
save
such
as
is
afforded
in
his
tasteful
and
elegant
home
he
loves
books
flowers
music
paintings
and
his
dog
he
is
a
stern
man
and
shares
his
griefs
and
joys
with
no
one
all
this
i
have
told
you
before
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
at
last
by
an
exclamation
from
beulah
oh
how
beautiful
how
silent
how
solemn
look
down
the
long
dim
aisles
it
is
an
oratory
where
my
soul
comes
to
worship
presently
the
breeze
will
rush
up
from
the
gulf
and
sweep
the
green
organ
and
a
melancholy
chant
will
swell
through
these
dusky
arches
oh
what
are
gothic
cathedrals
and
gilded
shrines
in
comparison
with
these
grand
forest
temples
where
the
dome
is
the
bending
vault
of
god
blue
and
the
columns
are
these
everlasting
pines
she
pointed
to
a
thick
clump
of
pines
sloping
down
to
a
ravine
the
setting
sun
threw
long
quivering
rays
through
the
clustering
boughs
and
the
broken
beams
piercing
the
gloom
beyond
showed
the
long
aisles
as
in
a
cathedral
light
as
clara
looked
down
the
dim
glade
and
then
watched
beulah
parted
lips
and
sparkling
eyes
as
she
stood
bending
forward
with
rapturous
delight
written
on
every
feature
she
thought
that
she
had
indeed
misjudged
her
in
using
the
epithets
freezing
and
heartless
you
are
enthusiastic
said
she
gently
how
can
i
help
it
i
love
the
grand
and
beautiful
too
well
to
offer
a
tribute
of
silent
admiration
oh
my
homage
is
that
of
a
whole
heart
they
reached
home
in
the
gloaming
and
each
retired
to
her
own
room
for
a
mere
trifle
beulah
had
procured
the
use
of
a
melodeon
and
now
after
placing
the
drooping
flowers
in
water
she
sat
down
before
the
instrument
and
poured
out
the
joy
of
her
soul
in
song
sad
memories
no
longer
floated
like
corpses
on
the
sea
of
the
past
grim
forebodings
crouched
among
the
mists
of
the
future
and
she
sang
song
after
song
exulting
in
the
gladness
of
her
heart
an
analysis
of
these
occasional
hours
of
delight
was
as
impossible
as
their
creation
sometimes
she
was
conscious
of
their
approach
while
gazing
up
at
the
starry
islets
in
the
boundless
lake
of
azure
sky
or
when
a
gorgeous
sunset
pageant
was
passing
away
sometimes
from
hearing
a
solemn
chant
in
church
or
a
witching
strain
from
a
favorite
opera
sometimes
from
viewing
dim
old
pictures
sometimes
from
reading
a
sublime
passage
in
some
old
english
or
german
author
it
was
a
serene
elevation
of
feeling
an
unbounded
peace
a
chastened
joyousness
which
she
was
rarely
able
to
analyze
but
which
isolated
her
for
a
time
from
all
surrounding
circumstances
how
long
she
sang
on
the
present
occasion
she
knew
not
and
only
paused
on
hearing
a
heavy
sob
behind
her
turning
round
she
saw
clara
sitting
near
with
her
face
in
her
hands
kneeling
beside
her
beulah
wound
her
arms
around
her
and
asked
earnestly
what
troubles
you
my
friend
may
i
not
know
clara
dropped
her
head
on
beulah
shoulder
and
answered
hesitatingly
the
tones
of
your
voice
always
sadden
me
they
are
like
organ
notes
solemn
and
awful
yes
awful
and
yet
very
sweet
sweeter
than
any
music
i
ever
heard
your
singing
fascinates
me
yet
strange
as
it
may
seem
it
very
often
makes
me
weep
there
is
an
unearthliness
a
spirituality
that
affects
me
singularly
i
am
glad
that
is
all
i
was
afraid
you
were
distressed
about
something
here
take
my
rocking
chair
i
am
going
to
read
and
if
you
like
you
may
have
the
benefit
of
my
book
beulah
do
put
away
your
books
for
one
night
and
let
us
have
a
quiet
time
do
study
now
come
sit
here
and
talk
to
me
flatterer
do
you
pretend
that
you
prefer
my
chattering
to
the
wonderful
words
of
a
man
who
like
an
angel
you
must
listen
to
the
tale
of
that
mariner
with
glittering
eye
spare
me
that
horrible
ghostly
story
of
vessels
freighted
with
staring
corpses
ugh
it
curdled
the
blood
in
my
veins
once
and
i
shut
the
book
in
disgust
do
begin
it
now
for
heaven
sake
why
clara
it
is
the
most
thrilling
poem
in
the
english
language
each
reperusal
fascinates
me
more
and
more
it
requires
a
dozen
readings
to
initiate
you
fully
into
its
weird
supernatural
realms
yes
and
it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
i
do
choose
to
hear
it
there
is
quite
enough
of
the
grim
and
hideous
in
reality
without
hunting
it
up
in
pages
of
fiction
when
i
read
i
desire
to
relax
my
mind
not
put
it
on
the
rack
as
your
favorite
books
invariably
do
absolutely
beulah
after
listening
to
some
of
your
pet
authors
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
standing
on
my
head
you
need
not
look
so
coolly
incredulous
it
is
a
positive
fact
as
for
that
mariner
you
are
so
fond
of
i
am
disposed
to
take
the
author
own
opinion
of
it
as
expressed
in
those
lines
addressed
to
himself
i
suppose
then
you
fancy
as
little
as
the
other
seeing
that
it
is
a
tale
of
witchcraft
how
would
you
relish
that
grand
anthem
to
nature
god
written
in
the
vale
of
chamouni
i
never
read
it
answered
clara
very
quietly
what
never
read
leaves
why
i
will
wager
my
head
that
you
have
parsed
from
them
a
thousand
times
never
read
that
magnificent
hymn
before
sunrise
in
the
midst
of
glaciers
and
crowned
peaks
listen
then
and
if
you
do
feel
like
falling
upon
your
knees
you
have
not
a
spark
of
poetry
in
your
soul
she
drew
the
lamp
close
to
her
and
read
aloud
her
finely
modulated
voice
was
peculiarly
adapted
to
the
task
and
her
expressive
countenance
faithfully
depicted
the
contending
emotions
which
filled
her
mind
as
she
read
clara
listened
with
pleased
interest
and
when
the
short
poem
was
concluded
said
thank
you
it
is
beautiful
i
have
often
seen
extracts
from
it
still
there
is
a
description
of
mont
blanc
in
which
i
believe
i
like
quite
as
well
what
that
witch
fragment
yes
i
do
understand
here
and
there
are
passages
in
cipher
i
read
and
catch
a
glimpse
of
hidden
meaning
i
read
again
and
it
vanishes
in
mist
it
seems
to
me
a
poem
of
symbols
dimly
adumbrating
truths
which
my
clouded
intellect
clutches
at
in
vain
i
have
a
sort
of
shadowy
belief
that
as
in
its
ancient
mythological
significance
symbolizes
nature
there
is
a
dusky
vein
of
mystery
shrouding
her
which
favors
my
idea
of
her
as
representing
the
universe
manfred
with
daring
hand
tore
away
that
of
isis
which
no
mortal
had
ever
pierced
before
and
maddened
by
the
mockery
of
the
stony
features
paid
the
penalty
of
his
sacrilegious
rashness
and
fled
from
the
temple
striving
to
shake
off
the
curse
my
guardian
has
a
curious
print
of
taken
from
some
european
byronic
gallery
i
have
studied
it
until
almost
it
seemed
to
move
and
speak
to
me
she
is
clad
in
the
ghostly
drapery
of
the
tomb
just
as
invoked
by
nemesis
with
trailing
tresses
closed
eyes
and
folded
hands
the
features
are
dim
spectral
yet
marvelously
beautiful
almost
one
might
think
the
eyelids
quivered
there
is
such
an
air
of
waking
dreaminess
that
this
is
a
false
and
inadequate
conception
of
byron
i
feel
assured
and
trust
that
i
shall
yet
find
the
key
to
this
enigma
it
interests
me
greatly
and
by
some
inexplicable
process
whenever
i
sit
pondering
the
mystery
of
astarte
that
wonderful
creation
in
presents
itself
astarte
becomes
in
a
trice
that
nature
kneeling
before
the
red
hills
of
the
west
at
her
evening
prayers
i
see
her
prostrate
on
the
great
steps
of
her
altar
praying
for
a
fair
night
for
mariners
at
sea
for
lambs
in
moors
and
unfledged
birds
in
woods
her
robe
of
blue
air
spreads
to
the
outskirts
of
the
heath
a
veil
white
as
an
avalanche
sweeps
from
her
head
to
her
feet
and
arabesques
of
lightning
flame
on
its
borders
i
see
her
zone
purple
like
the
horizon
through
its
blush
shines
the
star
of
evening
her
forehead
has
the
expanse
of
a
cloud
and
is
paler
than
the
early
moon
risen
long
before
dark
gathers
she
reclines
on
the
ridge
of
moor
her
mighty
hands
are
joined
beneath
it
so
kneeling
face
to
face
speaks
with
god
oh
i
would
give
twenty
years
of
my
life
to
have
painted
that
titan
portrait
i
would
rather
have
been
the
author
of
this
than
have
wielded
the
scepter
of
zenobia
in
the
palmiest
days
of
palmyra
she
spoke
rapidly
and
with
white
lips
that
quivered
clara
looked
at
her
wonderingly
and
said
hesitatingly
i
do
understand
the
half
of
what
you
have
been
saying
it
sounds
to
me
very
much
as
if
you
had
stumbled
into
a
lumber
room
of
queer
ideas
snatched
up
a
handful
all
on
different
subjects
and
woven
them
into
a
speech
as
incongruous
as
joseph
variegated
coat
there
was
no
reply
beulah
hands
were
clasped
on
the
table
before
her
and
she
leaned
forward
with
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
the
floor
clara
waited
a
moment
and
then
continued
i
never
noticed
any
of
the
mysteries
of
that
seem
to
trouble
you
so
much
i
enjoy
the
fine
passages
and
never
think
of
the
hidden
meanings
as
you
call
them
whereas
it
seems
you
are
always
plunging
about
in
the
dark
hunting
you
know
not
what
i
am
content
to
glide
on
the
surface
and
and
live
in
the
midst
of
foam
and
bubbles
cried
beulah
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
better
that
than
grope
among
subterranean
caverns
black
and
icy
as
you
are
forever
doing
you
are
even
getting
a
weird
unearthly
look
sometimes
when
i
come
in
and
find
you
book
in
hand
with
that
expression
in
your
eyes
i
really
dislike
to
speak
to
you
there
is
no
more
color
in
your
face
and
hands
than
in
that
wall
yonder
you
will
dig
your
grave
among
books
if
you
do
take
care
there
is
such
a
thing
as
studying
too
much
your
mind
is
perpetually
at
work
all
day
you
are
thinking
thinking
thinking
and
at
night
since
the
warm
weather
has
made
me
open
the
door
between
our
rooms
i
hear
you
talking
earnestly
and
rapidly
in
your
sleep
last
week
i
came
in
on
tiptoe
and
stood
a
few
minutes
beside
your
bed
the
moon
shone
in
through
the
window
and
though
you
were
fast
asleep
i
saw
that
you
tossed
your
hands
restlessly
while
i
stood
there
you
spoke
aloud
in
an
incoherent
manner
of
the
fugue
and
of
sudden
death
and
now
and
then
you
frowned
and
sighed
heavily
as
if
you
were
in
pain
music
is
a
relaxation
to
most
people
but
it
seems
to
put
your
thoughts
on
the
rack
you
will
wear
yourself
out
prematurely
if
you
do
quit
this
constant
studying
she
rose
to
go
and
glancing
up
at
her
beulah
answered
musingly
we
are
very
unlike
the
things
that
i
love
you
shrink
from
as
dull
and
tiresome
i
live
in
a
different
world
books
are
to
me
what
family
and
friends
and
society
are
to
other
people
it
may
be
that
the
isolation
of
my
life
necessitates
this
doubtless
you
often
find
me
abstracted
are
you
going
so
soon
i
had
hoped
we
should
spend
a
profitable
evening
but
it
has
slipped
away
and
i
have
done
nothing
she
rose
and
gave
the
customary
kiss
and
as
clara
retired
to
her
own
room
beulah
turned
up
the
wick
of
her
lamp
and
resumed
her
book
the
gorgeous
mazes
of
coleridge
no
longer
imprisoned
her
fancy
it
wandered
mid
the
silence
and
desolation
and
sand
rivulets
of
the
thebaid
desert
through
the
date
groves
of
the
lonely
laura
through
the
museums
of
alexandria
over
the
cool
crystal
depths
of
hypatia
her
thirsty
spirit
hung
eagerly
in
philammon
intellectual
nature
she
found
a
startling
resemblance
to
her
own
like
him
she
had
entered
a
forbidden
temple
and
learned
to
question
and
the
same
insatiable
craving
to
know
the
mysteries
of
learning
was
impelling
her
with
irresistible
force
out
into
the
world
of
philosophic
inquiry
hours
fled
on
unnoted
with
nervous
haste
the
leaves
were
turned
the
town
clock
struck
three
as
she
finished
the
book
and
laid
it
on
the
table
she
bowed
her
head
upon
her
hands
she
was
bewildered
was
kingsley
his
own
or
did
he
heartily
believe
in
the
christianity
of
which
he
had
given
so
hideous
a
portraiture
her
brain
whirled
yet
there
was
a
great
dissatisfaction
she
could
not
contentedly
go
back
to
the
laura
with
philammon
hypatia
was
not
sufficiently
explicit
she
was
dissatisfied
there
was
more
than
this
alexandrian
ecstasy
to
which
hypatia
was
driven
but
where
and
how
should
she
find
it
who
would
guide
her
was
not
her
guardian
in
many
respects
as
skeptical
as
raphael
himself
dare
she
enter
alone
and
unaided
this
cretan
maze
of
investigation
where
all
the
wonderful
lore
of
the
gifted
hypatia
had
availed
nothing
what
was
her
intellect
given
her
for
if
not
to
be
thus
employed
her
head
ached
with
the
intensity
of
thought
and
as
she
laid
it
on
her
pillow
and
closed
her
eyes
day
looked
out
over
the
eastern
sky
the
ensuing
week
was
one
of
anxious
apprehension
to
all
within
the
city
harriet
words
seemed
prophetic
there
was
every
intimation
of
a
sickly
season
yellow
fever
had
made
its
appearance
in
several
sections
of
the
town
in
its
most
malignant
type
the
board
of
health
devised
various
schemes
for
arresting
the
advancing
evil
the
streets
were
powdered
with
lime
and
huge
fires
of
tar
kept
constantly
burning
yet
daily
hourly
the
fatality
increased
and
as
colossal
ruin
strode
on
the
terrified
citizens
fled
in
all
directions
in
ten
days
the
epidemic
began
to
make
fearful
havoc
all
classes
and
ages
were
assailed
indiscriminately
whole
families
were
stricken
down
in
a
day
and
not
one
member
spared
to
aid
the
others
the
exodus
was
only
limited
by
impossibility
all
who
could
abandoned
their
homes
and
sought
safety
in
flight
these
were
the
fortunate
minority
and
as
if
resolved
to
wreak
its
fury
on
the
remainder
the
contagion
spread
into
every
quarter
of
the
city
not
even
physicians
were
spared
and
those
who
escaped
trembled
in
anticipation
of
the
fell
stroke
many
doubted
that
it
was
yellow
fever
and
conjectured
that
the
veritable
plague
had
crossed
the
ocean
of
all
hoyt
boarders
but
half
a
dozen
determined
to
hazard
remaining
in
the
infected
region
these
were
beulah
clara
and
four
gentlemen
gladly
would
clara
have
fled
to
a
place
of
safety
had
it
been
in
her
power
but
there
was
no
one
to
accompany
or
watch
over
her
and
as
she
was
forced
to
witness
the
horrors
of
the
season
a
sort
of
despair
seemed
to
nerve
her
trembling
frame
watson
had
been
among
the
first
to
leave
the
city
madam
cymon
had
disbanded
her
school
and
as
only
her
three
daughters
continued
to
take
music
lessons
beulah
had
ample
leisure
to
contemplate
the
distressing
scenes
which
surrounded
her
at
noon
one
september
day
she
stood
at
the
open
window
of
her
room
the
air
was
intensely
hot
the
drooping
leaves
of
the
china
trees
were
motionless
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirring
and
the
sable
plumes
of
the
hearses
were
still
as
their
burdens
the
brazen
glittering
sky
seemed
a
huge
glowing
furnace
breathing
out
only
scorching
heat
beulah
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
wiping
away
the
heavy
drops
that
stood
on
her
brow
looked
down
the
almost
deserted
street
many
of
the
stores
were
closed
whilom
busy
haunts
were
silent
and
very
few
persons
were
visible
save
the
drivers
of
two
hearses
and
of
a
cart
filled
with
coffins
the
church
bells
tolled
unceasingly
and
the
desolation
the
horror
were
indescribable
as
the
sable
wings
of
the
destroyer
hung
over
the
doomed
city
out
of
her
ten
four
slept
in
the
cemetery
the
night
before
she
had
watched
beside
another
and
at
dawn
saw
the
limbs
stiffen
and
the
eyes
grow
sightless
among
her
former
schoolmates
the
contagion
had
been
particularly
fatal
and
fearless
of
danger
she
had
nursed
two
of
them
as
she
stood
fanning
herself
clara
entered
hurriedly
and
sinking
into
a
chair
exclaimed
in
accents
of
terror
it
has
come
as
i
knew
it
would
two
of
hoyt
children
have
been
taken
and
i
believe
one
of
the
waiters
also
merciful
god
what
will
become
of
me
her
teeth
chattered
and
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
do
be
alarmed
clara
your
excessive
terror
is
your
greatest
danger
if
you
would
escape
you
must
keep
as
quiet
as
possible
she
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
and
made
her
drink
it
then
asked
can
hoyt
get
medical
aid
no
she
has
sent
for
every
doctor
in
town
and
not
one
has
come
then
i
will
go
down
and
assist
her
beulah
turned
toward
the
door
but
clara
caught
her
dress
and
said
hoarsely
are
you
mad
thus
continually
to
put
your
life
in
jeopardy
are
you
shod
with
immortality
that
you
thrust
yourself
into
the
very
path
of
destruction
i
am
not
afraid
of
the
fever
and
therefore
think
i
shall
not
take
it
as
long
as
i
am
able
to
be
up
i
shall
do
all
that
i
can
to
relieve
the
sick
remember
clara
nurses
are
not
to
be
had
now
for
any
sum
she
glided
down
the
steps
and
found
the
terrified
mother
wringing
her
hands
helplessly
over
the
stricken
ones
the
children
were
crying
on
the
bed
and
with
the
energy
which
the
danger
demanded
beulah
speedily
ordered
the
mustard
baths
and
administered
the
remedies
she
had
seen
prescribed
on
previous
occasions
the
fever
rose
rapidly
and
undaunted
by
thoughts
of
personal
danger
she
took
her
place
beside
the
bed
it
was
past
midnight
when
asbury
came
exhausted
and
haggard
from
unremitting
toil
and
vigils
he
looked
several
years
older
than
when
she
had
last
seen
him
he
started
on
perceiving
her
perilous
post
and
said
anxiously
oh
you
are
rash
very
rash
what
would
hartwell
say
what
will
he
think
when
he
comes
comes
surely
you
have
not
urged
him
to
come
back
now
said
she
grasping
his
arm
convulsively
certainly
i
telegraphed
to
him
to
come
home
by
express
you
need
not
look
so
troubled
he
has
had
this
egyptian
plague
will
run
no
risk
and
even
if
he
should
will
return
as
soon
as
possible
are
you
sure
that
he
has
had
the
fever
yes
sure
i
nursed
him
myself
the
summer
after
he
came
from
europe
and
thought
he
would
die
that
was
the
last
sickly
season
we
have
had
for
years
but
this
caps
the
climax
of
all
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
in
america
thank
god
my
wife
and
children
are
far
away
and
free
from
apprehension
on
their
account
i
can
do
my
duty
all
this
was
said
in
an
undertone
and
after
advising
everything
that
could
possibly
be
done
he
left
the
room
beckoning
beulah
after
him
she
followed
and
he
said
earnestly
child
i
tremble
for
you
why
did
you
leave
hartwell
house
and
incur
all
this
peril
beulah
though
it
is
nobly
unselfish
in
you
to
devote
yourself
to
the
sick
as
you
are
doing
it
may
cost
you
your
life
nay
most
probably
it
will
i
have
thought
of
it
all
sir
and
determined
to
do
my
duty
then
god
preserve
you
those
children
have
been
taken
violently
watch
them
closely
good
nursing
is
worth
all
the
apothecary
shops
you
need
not
send
for
me
any
more
i
am
out
constantly
whenever
i
can
i
will
come
meantime
depend
only
on
the
nursing
should
you
be
taken
yourself
let
me
know
at
once
do
not
fail
a
word
more
keep
yourself
well
stimulated
he
hurried
away
and
she
returned
to
the
sickroom
to
speculate
on
the
probability
of
soon
meeting
her
guardian
who
can
tell
how
dreary
were
the
days
and
nights
that
followed
hoyt
took
the
fever
and
mother
and
children
moaned
together
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
the
eldest
child
a
girl
of
eight
years
died
with
beulah
hand
grasped
in
hers
happily
the
mother
was
unconscious
and
the
little
corpse
was
borne
into
an
adjoining
room
beulah
shrank
from
the
task
which
she
felt
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
called
on
to
perform
she
could
nurse
the
living
but
dreaded
the
thought
of
shrouding
the
dead
still
there
was
no
one
else
to
do
it
and
she
bravely
conquered
her
repugnance
and
clad
the
young
sleeper
for
the
tomb
the
gentlemen
boarders
who
had
luckily
escaped
arranged
the
mournful
particulars
of
the
burial
and
after
severing
a
sunny
lock
of
hair
for
the
mother
should
she
live
beulah
saw
the
cold
form
borne
out
to
its
last
another
gloomy
day
passed
slowly
and
she
was
rewarded
by
the
convalescence
of
the
remaining
sick
child
hoyt
still
hung
upon
the
confines
of
eternity
and
beulah
who
had
not
closed
her
eyes
for
many
nights
was
leaning
over
the
bed
counting
the
rushing
pulse
when
a
rapid
step
caused
her
to
look
up
and
falling
forward
in
her
arms
clara
cried
save
me
save
me
the
chill
is
on
me
now
it
was
too
true
and
as
beulah
assisted
her
to
her
room
and
carefully
bathed
her
feet
her
heart
was
heavy
with
dire
dread
lest
clara
horror
of
the
disease
should
augment
its
ravages
asbury
was
summoned
with
all
haste
but
as
usual
seemed
an
age
in
coming
and
when
at
last
he
came
could
only
prescribe
what
had
already
been
done
it
was
pitiable
to
watch
the
agonized
expression
of
sweet
face
as
she
looked
from
the
countenance
of
the
physician
to
that
of
her
friend
striving
to
discover
their
opinion
of
her
case
doctor
you
must
send
hal
to
me
he
can
nurse
hoyt
and
little
willie
while
i
watch
clara
i
ca
possibly
take
care
of
all
three
though
willie
is
a
great
deal
better
can
you
send
him
at
once
he
is
a
good
nurse
yes
he
has
been
nursing
poor
tom
hamil
but
he
died
about
an
hour
ago
and
hal
is
released
i
look
for
hartwell
hourly
you
do
keep
up
amazingly
bless
you
beulah
wringing
her
hand
he
descended
the
stairs
the
room
beulah
sat
down
beside
clara
and
taking
one
burning
hand
in
her
cool
palms
pressed
it
softly
saying
in
an
encouraging
tone
i
feel
so
much
relieved
about
willie
he
is
a
great
deal
better
and
i
think
hoyt
fever
is
abating
you
were
not
taken
so
severely
as
willie
and
if
you
will
go
to
sleep
quietly
i
believe
you
will
only
have
a
light
attack
did
those
downstairs
have
black
vomit
asked
clara
shudderingly
lizzie
had
it
the
others
did
not
try
not
to
think
about
it
go
to
sleep
what
was
that
the
doctor
said
about
hartwell
i
could
not
hear
very
well
you
talked
so
low
ah
tell
me
beulah
only
that
he
is
coming
home
soon
that
was
all
do
talk
any
more
clara
closed
her
eyes
but
tears
stole
from
beneath
the
lashes
and
coursed
rapidly
down
her
glowing
cheeks
the
lips
moved
in
prayer
and
her
fingers
closed
tightly
over
those
of
her
companion
beulah
felt
that
her
continued
vigils
and
exertions
were
exhausting
her
her
limbs
trembled
when
she
walked
and
there
was
a
dull
pain
in
her
head
which
she
could
not
banish
her
appetite
had
long
since
forsaken
her
and
it
was
only
by
the
exertion
of
a
determined
will
that
she
forced
herself
to
eat
she
was
warmly
attached
to
clara
and
the
dread
of
losing
this
friend
caused
her
to
suffer
keenly
occasionally
she
stole
away
to
see
the
other
sufferers
fearing
that
when
hoyt
discovered
lizzie
death
the
painful
intelligence
would
seal
her
own
fate
it
was
late
at
night
she
had
just
returned
from
one
of
these
hasty
visits
and
finding
that
hal
was
as
attentive
as
anyone
could
be
she
threw
herself
weary
and
anxious
into
an
armchair
beside
clara
bed
the
crimson
face
was
turned
toward
her
the
parched
lips
parted
the
panting
breath
labored
and
irregular
the
victim
was
delirious
the
hazel
eyes
inflamed
and
vacant
rested
on
beulah
countenance
and
she
murmured
he
will
never
know
oh
no
how
should
he
the
grave
will
soon
shut
me
in
and
i
shall
see
him
no
more
no
more
she
shuddered
and
turned
away
beulah
leaned
her
head
against
the
bed
and
as
a
tear
slid
down
upon
her
hand
she
thought
and
said
with
bitter
sorrow
i
would
rather
see
her
the
victim
of
death
than
have
her
drag
out
an
aimless
cheerless
existence
rendered
joyless
by
this
hopeless
attachment
she
wondered
whether
hartwell
suspected
this
love
he
was
remarkably
and
men
as
well
as
women
were
very
vain
and
wont
to
give
even
undue
weight
to
every
circumstance
which
flattered
their
she
had
long
seen
this
partiality
would
not
the
object
of
it
be
quite
as
penetrating
clara
was
very
pretty
nay
at
times
she
was
beautiful
if
conscious
of
her
attachment
could
he
ever
suffer
himself
to
be
influenced
by
it
no
impossible
there
were
utter
antagonisms
of
taste
and
temperament
which
rendered
it
very
certain
that
she
would
not
suit
him
for
a
companion
yet
she
was
very
lovable
beulah
walked
softly
across
the
room
and
leaned
out
of
the
window
an
awful
stillness
brooded
over
the
city
the
moving
moon
went
up
the
sky
and
nowhere
did
abide
softly
she
was
going
up
and
a
star
or
two
beside
the
soft
beams
struggled
to
pierce
the
murky
air
dense
with
smoke
from
the
burning
pitch
there
was
no
tread
on
the
pavement
all
was
solemn
as
death
who
held
such
mad
revel
in
the
crowded
graveyards
through
the
shroud
of
smoke
she
could
see
the
rippling
waters
of
the
bay
as
the
faint
southern
breeze
swept
its
surface
it
was
a
desolation
realizing
all
the
horrors
of
the
masque
of
the
red
death
and
as
she
thought
of
the
mourning
hearts
in
that
silent
city
of
clara
danger
and
her
own
beulah
repeated
sadly
those
solemn
lines
clouds
that
rake
the
mountain
summit
or
waves
that
own
no
curbing
hand
how
fast
has
brother
followed
brother
from
sunshine
to
the
sunless
land
clasping
her
hands
she
added
earnestly
i
thank
thee
my
father
that
the
atlantic
rolls
between
eugene
and
this
of
destruction
a
touch
on
her
shoulder
caused
her
to
look
around
and
her
eyes
rested
on
her
guardian
she
started
but
did
not
speak
and
held
out
her
hand
he
looked
at
her
long
and
searchingly
his
lip
trembled
and
instead
of
taking
her
offered
hand
he
passed
his
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
to
his
bosom
she
looked
up
with
surprise
and
bending
his
haughty
head
he
kissed
her
pale
brow
for
the
first
time
she
felt
then
that
she
would
like
to
throw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
tell
him
how
very
glad
she
was
to
see
him
again
how
unhappy
his
sudden
departure
had
made
her
but
a
feeling
she
could
not
pause
to
analyze
prevented
her
from
following
the
dictates
of
her
heart
and
holding
her
off
so
as
to
scan
her
countenance
hartwell
said
how
worn
and
haggard
you
look
oh
child
your
rash
obstinacy
has
tortured
me
beyond
expression
i
have
but
done
my
duty
it
has
been
a
horrible
time
i
am
glad
you
have
come
you
will
not
let
clara
die
sit
down
child
you
are
trembling
from
exhaustion
he
drew
up
a
chair
for
her
and
taking
her
wrist
in
his
hand
said
as
he
examined
the
slow
pulse
was
clara
taken
violently
how
is
she
she
is
delirious
and
so
much
alarmed
at
her
danger
that
i
feel
very
uneasy
about
her
come
and
see
her
perhaps
she
will
know
you
she
led
the
way
to
the
bedside
but
there
was
no
recognition
in
the
wild
restless
eyes
and
as
she
tossed
from
side
to
side
her
incoherent
muttering
made
beulah
dread
lest
she
should
discover
to
its
object
the
adoring
love
which
filled
her
pure
heart
she
told
her
guardian
what
had
been
prescribed
he
offered
no
suggestion
as
to
the
treatment
but
gave
a
potion
which
she
informed
him
was
due
as
clara
swallowed
the
draught
she
looked
at
him
and
said
eagerly
has
he
come
did
he
say
he
would
see
me
and
save
me
did
hartwell
send
me
this
she
raves
said
beulah
hastily
a
shadow
fell
upon
his
face
and
stooping
over
the
pillow
he
answered
very
gently
yes
he
has
come
to
save
you
he
is
here
she
smiled
and
seemed
satisfied
for
a
moment
then
moaned
and
muttered
on
indistinctly
he
knows
it
all
oh
poor
poor
clara
thought
beulah
shading
her
face
to
prevent
his
reading
what
passed
in
her
mind
how
long
have
you
been
sitting
up
beulah
she
told
him
it
is
no
wonder
you
look
as
if
years
had
suddenly
passed
over
your
head
you
have
a
room
here
i
believe
go
to
it
and
go
to
sleep
i
will
not
leave
clara
it
was
astonishing
how
his
presence
removed
the
dread
weight
of
responsibility
from
her
heart
not
until
this
moment
had
she
felt
as
if
she
could
possibly
sleep
i
will
sleep
now
so
as
to
be
refreshed
for
and
night
here
is
a
couch
i
will
sleep
here
and
if
clara
grows
worse
you
must
wake
me
she
crossed
the
room
threw
herself
on
the
couch
and
laid
her
aching
head
on
her
arm
hartwell
placed
a
pillow
under
the
head
once
more
his
fingers
sought
her
wrist
once
more
his
lips
touched
her
forehead
and
as
he
returned
to
watch
beside
clara
and
listen
to
her
ravings
beulah
sank
into
a
heavy
dreamless
sleep
of
exhaustion
chapter
xviii
she
was
awakened
by
the
cool
pattering
of
raindrops
which
beat
through
the
shutters
and
fell
upon
her
face
she
sprang
up
with
a
thrill
of
delight
and
looked
out
a
leaden
sky
lowered
over
the
city
and
as
the
torrents
came
down
in
whitening
sheets
the
thunder
rolled
continuously
overhead
and
trailing
wreaths
of
smoke
from
the
dying
fires
drooped
like
banners
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
not
the
shower
which
gathered
and
fell
around
seagirt
carmel
was
more
gratefully
received
thank
god
it
rains
cried
beulah
and
turning
toward
clara
she
saw
with
pain
that
the
sufferer
was
all
unconscious
of
the
tardy
blessing
she
kissed
the
hot
dry
brow
but
no
token
of
recognition
greeted
her
anxious
gaze
the
fever
was
at
its
height
the
delicate
features
were
strangely
sharpened
and
distorted
save
the
sound
of
her
labored
breathing
the
room
was
silent
and
sinking
on
her
knees
beulah
prayed
earnestly
that
the
gentle
sufferer
might
be
spared
as
she
rose
her
guardian
entered
and
she
started
at
the
haggard
wasted
harassed
look
of
the
noble
face
which
she
had
not
observed
before
he
bent
down
and
coaxed
clara
to
take
a
spoonful
of
medicine
and
beulah
asked
earnestly
have
you
been
ill
sir
no
he
did
not
even
glance
at
her
the
affectionate
cordiality
of
the
hour
of
meeting
had
utterly
vanished
he
looked
as
cold
stern
and
impenetrable
as
some
sphinx
of
the
desert
have
you
seen
the
others
this
morning
said
she
making
a
strong
effort
to
conceal
the
chagrin
this
revulsion
of
feeling
occasioned
yes
hoyt
will
get
well
does
she
know
of
her
child
death
yes
you
are
not
going
surely
she
continued
as
he
took
his
hat
and
glanced
at
his
watch
i
am
needed
elsewhere
only
nursing
can
now
avail
here
you
know
very
well
what
is
requisite
either
asbury
or
i
will
be
here
again
to
sit
up
with
this
gentle
girl
you
need
neither
of
you
come
to
sit
up
with
her
i
will
do
that
myself
i
shall
not
sleep
another
moment
until
i
know
that
she
is
better
very
well
he
left
the
room
immediately
how
he
cases
his
volcanic
nature
in
ice
thought
beulah
sinking
into
the
armchair
last
night
he
seemed
so
kind
so
cordial
so
much
my
friend
and
guardian
there
is
a
mighty
barrier
as
though
he
stood
on
some
towering
crag
and
talked
to
me
across
an
infinite
gulf
well
well
even
an
arctic
night
passes
away
and
i
can
afford
to
wait
till
his
humor
changes
for
many
hours
the
rain
fell
unceasingly
but
toward
sunset
the
pall
of
clouds
was
scourged
on
by
a
brisk
western
breeze
and
the
clear
canopy
of
heaven
no
longer
fiery
as
for
days
past
but
cool
and
blue
bent
serenely
over
the
wet
earth
the
slanting
rays
of
the
swiftly
sinking
sun
flashed
through
dripping
boughs
creating
myriads
of
diamond
sprays
and
over
the
sparkling
waters
of
the
bay
sprang
a
brilliant
bow
arching
superbly
along
the
eastern
horizon
where
a
bank
of
clouds
still
lay
verily
it
seemed
a
new
covenant
that
the
destroying
demon
should
no
longer
desolate
the
beautiful
city
and
to
many
an
anxious
foreboding
heart
that
glorious
rainbow
gave
back
hope
and
faith
a
cool
quiet
twilight
followed
beulah
knew
that
hearses
still
bore
the
dead
to
their
silent
chambers
she
could
hear
the
rumbling
the
melancholy
solemn
sound
of
the
wheels
but
firm
trust
reigned
in
her
heart
and
with
clara
hand
in
hers
she
felt
an
intuitive
assurance
that
the
loved
one
would
not
yet
be
summoned
from
her
earthly
field
of
action
the
sick
in
the
other
part
of
the
house
were
much
better
and
though
one
of
the
gentlemen
boarders
had
been
taken
since
morning
she
lighted
the
lamp
and
stole
about
the
room
with
a
calmer
happier
spirit
than
she
had
known
for
many
days
she
fancied
that
her
charge
breathed
more
easily
and
the
wild
stare
of
the
inflamed
eyes
was
concealed
under
the
long
lashes
which
lay
on
the
cheeks
the
sufferer
slept
and
the
watcher
augured
favorably
about
nine
she
heard
steps
on
the
stairs
and
soon
after
drs
asbury
and
hartwell
entered
together
there
was
little
to
be
told
and
less
to
be
advised
and
while
the
latter
attentively
examined
the
pulse
and
looked
down
at
the
altered
countenance
stamped
with
the
signet
of
the
dread
disease
the
former
took
beulah
hand
in
both
his
and
said
kindly
how
do
you
do
my
little
heroine
by
nebros
you
are
worth
your
weight
in
medical
treatises
how
are
you
little
one
quite
well
thank
you
sir
and
i
dare
say
i
am
much
more
able
to
sit
up
with
the
sick
than
you
who
have
had
no
respite
whatever
do
stand
up
when
you
must
be
so
weary
take
this
holding
his
hand
firmly
she
drew
him
down
to
it
there
had
always
been
a
fatherly
tenderness
in
his
manner
toward
her
when
visiting
at
her
guardian
and
she
regarded
him
with
reverence
and
affection
though
often
blunt
he
never
chilled
nor
repelled
her
as
his
partner
so
often
did
and
now
she
stood
beside
him
still
holding
one
of
his
hands
he
smoothed
back
the
gray
hair
from
his
furrowed
brow
and
with
a
twinkle
in
his
blue
eye
said
how
much
will
you
take
for
your
services
i
want
to
engage
you
to
teach
my
madcap
daughters
a
little
quiet
bravery
and
uncomplaining
endurance
i
have
none
of
the
shylock
in
my
composition
only
give
me
a
few
kind
words
and
i
shall
be
satisfied
now
once
for
all
asbury
if
you
treat
me
to
any
more
barefaced
flattery
of
this
sort
i
nurse
no
more
of
your
patients
hartwell
here
directed
his
partner
attention
to
clara
and
thoroughly
provoked
at
the
pertinacity
with
which
he
avoided
noticing
her
she
seized
the
brief
opportunity
to
visit
hoyt
and
little
willie
the
mother
welcomed
her
with
a
silent
grasp
of
the
hand
and
a
gush
of
tears
but
this
was
no
time
for
acknowledgments
and
beulah
strove
by
a
few
encouraging
remarks
to
cheer
the
bereaved
parent
and
interest
willie
who
like
all
other
children
under
such
circumstances
had
grown
fretful
she
shook
up
their
pillows
iced
a
fresh
pitcher
of
water
for
them
and
promising
to
run
down
and
see
them
often
now
that
hal
was
forced
to
give
his
attention
to
the
last
victim
she
noiselessly
stole
back
to
clara
room
hartwell
was
walking
up
and
down
the
floor
and
his
companion
sat
just
as
she
had
left
him
he
rose
as
she
entered
and
putting
on
his
hat
said
kindly
are
you
able
to
sit
up
with
miss
sanders
if
not
say
so
candidly
i
am
able
and
determined
to
do
so
very
well
after
it
will
not
be
needed
what
do
you
mean
cried
beulah
clutching
his
arm
do
look
so
savage
child
she
will
either
be
convalescent
or
beyond
all
aid
i
hope
and
believe
the
former
watch
her
closely
till
i
see
you
again
dear
child
he
stepped
to
the
door
and
with
a
slight
inclination
of
his
head
hartwell
followed
him
it
was
a
vigil
beulah
never
forgot
the
night
seemed
interminable
as
if
the
car
of
time
were
driven
backward
and
she
longed
inexpressibly
for
the
dawning
of
day
four
came
at
last
silence
brooded
over
the
town
the
western
breeze
had
sung
itself
to
rest
and
there
was
a
solemn
hush
as
though
all
nature
stood
still
to
witness
the
struggle
between
dusky
azrael
and
a
human
soul
clara
slept
the
distant
stars
looked
down
encouragingly
from
their
homes
of
blue
and
once
more
the
lonely
orphan
bent
her
knee
in
supplication
before
the
throne
of
jehovah
but
a
cloud
seemed
hovering
between
her
heart
and
the
of
deity
in
vain
she
prayed
and
tried
to
believe
that
life
would
be
spared
in
answer
to
her
petitions
faith
died
in
her
soul
and
she
sat
with
her
eyes
riveted
upon
the
face
of
her
friend
the
flush
of
consuming
fever
paled
the
pulse
was
slow
and
feeble
and
by
the
gray
light
of
day
beulah
saw
that
the
face
was
strangely
changed
for
several
hours
longer
she
maintained
her
watch
still
the
doctor
did
not
come
and
while
she
sat
with
clara
fingers
clasped
in
her
the
brown
eyes
opened
and
looked
dreamily
at
her
she
leaned
over
and
kissing
the
wan
cheek
asked
eagerly
how
do
you
feel
darling
perfectly
weak
and
helpless
how
long
have
i
been
sick
only
a
few
days
you
are
a
great
deal
better
now
she
tenderly
smoothed
the
silky
hair
that
clustered
in
disorder
round
the
face
clara
seemed
perplexed
she
thought
for
a
moment
and
said
feebly
have
i
been
very
ill
well
yes
you
have
been
right
sick
had
some
fever
but
it
has
left
you
clara
mused
again
memory
came
back
slowly
and
at
length
she
asked
did
they
all
die
did
who
die
all
those
downstairs
she
shuddered
violently
oh
no
hoyt
and
willie
are
almost
well
try
to
go
to
sleep
again
clara
several
minutes
glided
by
the
eyes
closed
and
clasping
fingers
tightly
she
asked
again
have
i
had
any
physician
yes
i
thought
it
would
do
no
harm
to
have
asbury
see
you
answered
beulah
carelessly
she
saw
an
expression
of
disappointment
pass
sadly
over
the
girl
countenance
and
thinking
it
might
be
as
well
to
satisfy
her
at
once
she
continued
as
if
speaking
on
indifferent
topics
hartwell
came
home
since
you
were
taken
sick
and
called
to
see
you
two
or
three
times
a
faint
glow
tinged
the
sallow
cheek
and
while
a
tremor
crept
over
her
lips
she
said
almost
inaudibly
when
will
he
come
again
before
long
i
dare
say
indeed
there
is
his
step
now
asbury
is
with
him
she
had
not
time
to
say
more
for
they
came
in
immediately
and
with
a
species
of
pity
she
noted
the
smile
of
pleasure
which
curved
clara
mouth
as
her
guardian
bent
down
and
spoke
to
her
while
he
took
her
thin
hand
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
her
face
asbury
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
said
bluntly
hurrah
for
you
all
right
again
as
i
thought
you
would
be
does
your
head
ache
at
all
this
morning
feel
like
eating
half
a
dozen
partridges
she
is
not
deaf
said
hartwell
rather
shortly
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
she
has
been
to
all
my
questions
lately
i
must
see
about
carter
below
beulah
child
you
look
the
worse
for
your
apprenticeship
to
our
profession
so
do
you
sir
said
she
smiling
as
her
eyes
wandered
over
his
grim
visage
you
may
well
say
that
child
i
snatched
about
two
hours
sleep
this
morning
and
when
i
woke
i
felt
very
much
like
unlucky
sailor
moved
and
could
not
feel
my
limbs
i
was
so
light
almost
i
thought
that
i
had
died
in
sleep
and
was
a
blessed
ghost
he
hurried
away
to
another
part
of
the
house
and
beulah
went
into
her
own
apartment
to
arrange
her
hair
which
she
felt
must
need
attention
sadly
looking
into
the
glass
she
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
the
face
which
looked
back
at
her
it
was
so
thin
and
ghastly
even
the
lips
were
colorless
and
the
large
eyes
sunken
she
unbound
her
hair
and
had
only
shaken
it
fully
out
when
a
knock
at
her
door
called
her
from
the
glass
she
tossed
her
hair
all
back
and
it
hung
like
an
inky
veil
almost
to
the
floor
as
she
opened
the
door
and
confronted
her
guardian
here
is
some
medicine
which
must
be
mixed
in
a
tumbler
of
water
i
want
a
tablespoonful
given
every
hour
unless
clara
is
asleep
keep
everything
quiet
is
that
all
said
beulah
coolly
that
is
all
he
walked
off
and
she
brushed
and
twisted
up
her
hair
wondering
how
long
he
meant
to
keep
up
that
freezing
manner
it
accorded
very
well
with
his
treatment
before
his
departure
for
the
north
and
she
sighed
as
she
recalled
the
brief
hour
of
cordiality
which
followed
his
return
she
began
to
perceive
that
this
was
the
way
they
were
to
meet
in
future
she
had
displeased
him
and
he
intended
that
she
should
feel
it
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
but
she
drove
them
scornfully
back
and
exclaimed
indignantly
he
wants
to
rule
me
with
a
rod
of
iron
because
i
am
indebted
to
him
for
an
education
and
support
for
several
years
as
i
hope
for
a
peaceful
rest
hereafter
i
will
repay
him
every
cent
he
has
expended
for
music
drawing
and
clothing
i
will
economize
until
every
picayune
is
returned
the
purse
had
not
been
touched
and
hastily
counting
the
contents
to
see
that
all
the
bills
were
there
she
relocked
the
drawer
and
returned
to
the
sickroom
with
anything
but
a
calm
face
clara
seemed
to
be
asleep
and
picking
up
a
book
beulah
began
to
read
a
sickroom
is
always
monotonous
and
dreary
and
long
confinement
had
rendered
beulah
restless
and
uncomfortable
her
limbs
ached
so
did
her
head
and
continued
loss
of
sleep
made
her
nervous
to
an
unusual
degree
she
longed
to
open
her
melodeon
and
play
this
would
have
quieted
her
but
of
course
was
not
to
be
thought
of
with
four
invalids
in
the
house
and
death
on
almost
every
square
in
the
city
she
was
no
longer
unhappy
about
clara
for
there
was
little
doubt
that
with
care
she
would
soon
be
well
and
thus
drearily
the
hours
wore
on
finally
clara
evinced
a
disposition
to
talk
her
nurse
discouraged
it
with
exceedingly
brief
replies
intimating
that
she
would
improve
her
condition
by
going
to
sleep
toward
evening
clara
seemed
much
refreshed
by
a
long
nap
and
took
some
food
which
had
been
prepared
for
her
the
sickness
is
abating
is
it
not
beulah
yes
very
perceptibly
but
more
from
lack
of
fresh
victims
than
anything
else
i
hope
we
shall
have
a
white
frost
soon
it
has
been
very
horrible
i
shudder
when
i
think
of
it
said
clara
then
do
think
of
it
answered
her
companion
oh
how
can
i
help
it
i
did
not
expect
to
live
through
it
i
was
sure
i
should
die
when
that
chill
came
on
you
have
saved
me
dear
beulah
tears
glistened
in
her
soft
eyes
no
god
saved
you
through
your
instrumentality
replied
clara
raising
her
hand
to
her
lips
do
talk
any
more
the
doctor
expressly
enjoined
quiet
for
you
i
am
glad
to
owe
my
recovery
to
him
also
how
noble
and
good
he
superior
to
everybody
else
murmured
the
sick
girl
beulah
lips
became
singularly
compact
but
she
offered
no
comment
she
walked
up
and
down
the
room
although
so
worn
out
that
she
could
scarcely
keep
herself
erect
when
the
doctor
came
she
escaped
unobserved
to
her
room
hastily
put
on
her
bonnet
and
ran
down
the
steps
for
a
short
walk
it
was
perfect
elysium
to
get
out
once
more
under
the
pure
sky
and
breathe
the
air
as
it
swept
over
the
bay
cool
sweet
and
invigorating
the
streets
were
still
quiet
but
hearses
and
carts
filled
with
coffins
no
longer
greeted
her
on
every
side
and
she
walked
for
several
squares
the
sun
went
down
and
too
weary
to
extend
her
ramble
she
slowly
retraced
her
steps
the
buggy
no
longer
stood
at
the
door
and
after
seeing
hoyt
and
trying
to
chat
pleasantly
she
crept
back
to
clara
where
have
you
been
asked
the
latter
to
get
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
see
the
sun
set
hartwell
asked
for
you
i
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
you
how
do
you
feel
said
beulah
laying
her
hand
softly
on
clara
forehead
better
but
very
weak
you
have
no
idea
how
feeble
i
am
beulah
i
want
to
know
whether
you
were
told
to
keep
quiet
so
do
ask
any
questions
for
i
will
not
answer
one
you
are
not
to
sit
up
the
doctor
said
i
would
not
require
it
let
the
doctor
go
back
to
the
north
and
theorize
in
his
medical
conventions
i
shall
sleep
here
by
your
bed
on
this
couch
if
you
feel
worse
call
me
now
and
do
open
your
lips
again
she
drew
the
couch
close
to
the
bed
and
shading
the
lamp
threw
her
weary
frame
down
to
rest
ere
long
she
slept
the
pestilential
storm
had
spent
its
fury
daily
the
number
of
deaths
diminished
gradually
the
pall
of
silence
and
desolation
which
had
hung
over
the
city
vanished
the
streets
resumed
their
usual
busy
aspect
and
the
hum
of
life
went
forward
once
more
at
length
fugitive
families
ventured
home
again
and
though
bands
of
crape
grim
badges
of
bereavement
met
the
eye
on
all
sides
all
rejoiced
that
death
had
removed
his
court
that
his
hideous
carnival
was
over
clara
regained
her
strength
very
slowly
and
when
well
enough
to
quit
her
room
walked
with
the
slow
uncertain
step
of
feebleness
on
the
last
day
of
october
she
entered
apartment
and
languidly
approached
the
table
where
the
latter
was
engaged
in
drawing
always
at
work
beulah
you
give
yourself
no
rest
day
and
night
you
are
constantly
busy
apparently
this
remark
fell
on
deaf
ears
for
without
replying
beulah
lifted
her
drawing
looked
at
it
intently
turned
it
round
once
or
twice
and
then
resumed
her
crayon
what
a
hideous
countenance
who
is
it
continued
clara
mors
she
is
horrible
where
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
during
the
height
of
the
epidemic
i
fell
asleep
for
a
few
seconds
and
dreamed
that
mors
was
sweeping
down
with
extended
arms
to
snatch
you
by
the
clock
i
had
not
slept
quite
two
minutes
yet
the
countenance
of
mors
was
indelibly
stamped
on
my
memory
and
now
i
am
transferring
it
to
paper
you
are
mistaken
it
is
terrible
but
not
hideous
beulah
laid
aside
her
pencil
and
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
table
sat
with
her
face
in
her
hands
gazing
upon
the
drawing
it
represented
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
winged
female
the
countenance
was
inflexible
grim
and
cadaverous
the
large
lurid
eyes
had
an
owlish
stare
and
the
outspread
pinions
black
as
night
made
the
wan
face
yet
more
livid
by
contrast
the
extended
hands
were
like
those
of
a
skeleton
what
strange
fancies
you
have
it
makes
the
blood
curdle
in
my
veins
to
look
at
that
awful
countenance
said
clara
shudderingly
i
can
not
draw
it
as
i
saw
it
in
my
dream
can
not
do
justice
to
my
ideal
mors
answered
beulah
in
a
discontented
tone
as
she
took
up
the
crayon
and
retouched
the
poppies
which
clustered
in
the
sable
locks
for
heaven
sake
do
not
attempt
to
render
it
any
more
horrible
put
it
away
and
finish
this
lovely
greek
face
oh
how
i
envy
you
your
talent
for
music
and
drawing
nature
gifted
you
rarely
no
she
merely
gave
me
an
intense
love
of
beauty
which
constantly
impels
me
to
embody
in
melody
or
coloring
the
glorious
images
which
the
contemplation
of
beauty
creates
in
my
soul
alas
i
am
not
a
genius
if
i
were
i
might
hope
to
achieve
an
immortal
renown
gladly
would
i
pay
its
painful
and
dangerous
price
she
placed
the
drawing
of
mors
in
her
portfolio
and
began
to
touch
lightly
an
unfinished
head
of
sappho
ah
clara
how
connoisseurs
would
carp
at
this
portrait
of
the
muse
my
guardian
for
one
would
sneer
superbly
why
pray
it
is
perfectly
beautiful
because
forsooth
it
is
no
swarthy
greek
i
have
a
penchant
for
high
broad
expansive
foreheads
which
are
antagonistic
to
all
the
ancient
models
of
beauty
low
foreheads
characterize
the
antique
but
who
can
fancy
immortal
sappho
that
gloriole
of
ebon
hair
on
calmed
brows
other
than
i
have
drawn
her
she
held
up
the
paper
and
smiled
triumphantly
in
truth
it
was
a
face
of
rare
loveliness
of
oval
outline
with
delicate
yet
noble
features
whose
expression
seemed
the
reflex
of
the
divine
afflatus
the
uplifted
eyes
beamed
with
the
radiance
of
inspiration
the
full
ripe
lips
were
just
parted
the
curling
hair
clustered
with
simplicity
round
the
classic
head
and
the
exquisitely
formed
hands
clasped
a
lyre
beulah
do
you
think
the
eyes
are
most
too
wild
suggested
clara
timidly
what
for
a
poetess
remember
poesy
hath
madness
in
it
answered
beulah
still
looking
earnestly
at
her
drawing
madness
what
do
you
mean
just
what
i
say
i
believe
poetry
to
be
the
highest
and
purest
phase
of
insanity
those
finely
strung
curiously
nervous
natures
that
you
always
find
coupled
with
poetic
endowments
are
characterized
by
a
remarkable
activity
of
the
mental
organs
and
this
continued
excitement
and
premature
development
of
the
brain
results
in
a
disease
which
under
this
aspect
the
world
offers
premiums
for
though
i
enjoy
a
fine
poem
as
much
as
anybody
i
believe
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
it
is
the
spasmodic
vent
of
a
highly
nervous
system
overstrained
diseased
yes
diseased
if
it
does
not
result
in
the
frantic
madness
of
lamb
or
the
final
imbecility
of
southey
it
is
manifested
in
various
other
forms
such
as
the
morbid
melancholy
of
cowper
the
bitter
misanthropy
of
pope
the
abnormal
moodiness
and
misery
of
byron
the
unsound
and
dangerous
theories
of
shelley
and
the
strange
fragmentary
nature
of
coleridge
oh
beulah
what
a
humiliating
theory
the
poet
placed
on
an
ignominious
level
with
the
nervous
hypochondriac
you
are
the
very
last
person
i
should
suppose
guilty
of
entertaining
such
a
degraded
estimate
of
human
powers
interposed
clara
energetically
i
know
it
is
customary
to
rave
about
muses
and
parnassus
and
helicon
and
to
throw
the
charitable
mantle
of
idiosyncrasies
over
all
those
dark
spots
on
poetic
disks
all
conceivable
and
inconceivable
eccentricities
are
pardoned
as
the
usual
concomitants
of
genius
but
looking
into
the
home
lives
of
many
of
the
most
distinguished
poets
i
have
been
painfully
impressed
with
the
truth
of
my
very
unpoetic
theory
common
sense
has
arraigned
before
her
august
tribunal
some
of
the
socalled
of
past
ages
and
the
critical
verdict
is
that
much
of
the
famous
frenzy
was
frenzy
of
a
sadder
nature
do
you
think
that
sappho
frenzy
was
established
by
the
leucadian
leap
you
confound
the
poetess
with
a
sappho
who
lived
later
and
threw
herself
into
the
sea
from
the
promontory
of
leucate
doubtless
she
too
had
idiosyncrasies
but
her
spotless
life
and
i
believe
natural
death
afford
no
indication
of
an
unsound
intellect
it
is
rather
immaterial
however
to
beulah
paused
abruptly
as
a
servant
entered
and
approached
the
table
saying
miss
clara
hartwell
is
in
the
parlor
and
wishes
to
see
you
to
see
me
repeated
clara
in
surprise
while
a
rosy
tinge
stole
into
her
wan
face
to
see
me
no
it
must
be
you
beulah
he
said
miss
sanders
persisted
the
servant
and
clara
left
the
room
beulah
looked
after
her
with
an
expression
of
some
surprise
then
continued
penciling
the
chords
of
sappho
lyre
a
few
minutes
elapsed
and
clara
returned
with
flushed
cheeks
and
a
smile
of
trembling
joyousness
beulah
do
pin
my
mantle
on
straight
i
am
in
such
a
hurry
only
think
how
kind
hartwell
is
he
has
come
to
take
me
out
to
ride
says
i
look
too
pale
and
he
thinks
a
ride
will
benefit
me
that
will
do
thank
you
she
turned
away
but
beulah
rose
and
called
out
come
back
here
and
get
my
velvet
mantle
it
is
quite
cool
and
it
will
be
a
marvelous
piece
of
management
to
ride
out
for
your
health
and
come
home
with
a
cold
what
no
gloves
either
upon
my
word
your
thoughts
must
be
traveling
over
the
bridge
shinevad
sure
enough
i
had
forgotten
my
gloves
i
will
get
them
as
i
go
down
with
the
mantle
on
her
arm
she
hurried
away
beulah
laid
aside
her
drawing
materials
and
prepared
for
her
customary
evening
walk
her
countenance
was
clouded
her
lip
unsteady
her
guardian
studied
coldness
and
avoidance
pained
her
but
it
was
not
this
which
saddened
her
now
she
felt
that
clara
was
staking
the
happiness
of
her
life
on
the
dim
hope
that
her
attachment
would
be
returned
she
pitied
the
delusion
and
dreaded
the
awakening
to
a
true
insight
into
his
nature
to
a
consciousness
of
the
utter
uncongeniality
which
she
fancied
barred
all
thought
of
such
a
union
as
she
walked
on
these
reflections
gave
place
to
others
entirely
removed
from
clara
and
her
guardian
and
on
reaching
the
grove
of
pines
opposite
the
asylum
where
she
had
so
often
wandered
in
days
gone
by
she
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
arched
aisles
as
she
was
wont
to
term
them
it
was
a
genuine
october
afternoon
cool
and
sunny
the
delicious
haze
of
indian
summer
wrapped
every
distant
object
in
its
soft
purple
veil
the
dim
vistas
of
the
forest
ended
in
misty
depths
the
very
air
in
its
dreamy
languor
resembled
the
atmosphere
which
surrounded
the
melancholy
of
the
far
east
through
the
openings
pale
golden
poplars
shook
down
their
dying
leaves
and
here
and
there
along
the
ravine
crimson
maples
gleamed
against
the
background
of
dark
green
pines
in
every
direction
leaves
painted
with
autumnal
hectic
strewed
the
bier
of
the
declining
year
beulah
sat
down
on
a
tuft
of
moss
and
gathered
clusters
of
and
purple
and
white
asters
she
loved
these
wild
much
more
than
gaudy
exotics
or
rare
hothouse
plants
they
linked
her
with
the
days
of
her
childhood
and
now
each
graceful
spray
of
seemed
a
wand
of
memory
calling
up
bygone
joys
griefs
and
fancies
ah
what
a
hallowing
glory
invests
our
past
beckoning
us
back
to
the
haunts
of
the
olden
time
the
paths
our
childish
feet
trod
seem
all
guarded
and
thornless
the
songs
we
sang
then
sweep
the
harp
of
memory
making
magical
melody
the
words
carelessly
spoken
now
breathe
a
solemn
mysterious
import
and
faces
that
early
went
down
to
the
tomb
smile
on
us
still
with
unchanged
tenderness
aye
the
past
the
long
past
is
all
fairyland
where
our
little
feet
were
bruised
we
now
see
only
springing
flowers
where
childish
lips
drank
from
some
marab
verdure
and
garlands
woo
us
back
over
the
rustling
leaves
a
tiny
form
glided
to
beulah
side
a
pure
infantine
face
with
golden
curls
looked
up
at
her
and
a
lisping
voice
of
unearthly
sweetness
whispered
in
the
autumn
air
here
she
had
often
brought
lilly
and
filled
her
baby
fingers
with
asters
and
goldenrod
and
gathered
bright
scarlet
leaves
to
please
her
childish
fancy
bitter
waves
had
broken
over
her
head
since
then
shadows
had
gathered
about
her
heart
oh
how
far
off
were
the
early
years
how
changed
she
was
how
different
life
and
the
world
seemed
to
her
now
the
flowery
meadows
were
behind
her
with
the
vestibule
of
girlhood
and
now
she
was
a
woman
with
no
ties
to
link
her
with
any
human
being
alone
and
dependent
only
on
herself
verily
she
might
have
exclaimed
in
the
mournful
words
of
lamb
all
all
are
gone
the
old
familiar
faces
she
sat
looking
at
the
wild
flowers
in
her
hand
a
sad
dreamy
light
filled
the
clear
gray
eyes
and
now
and
then
her
brow
was
plowed
by
some
troubled
thought
the
countenance
told
of
a
mind
perplexed
and
questioning
the
cloud
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
had
crept
up
from
the
horizon
of
faith
and
now
darkened
her
sky
but
she
would
not
see
the
gathering
gloom
shut
her
eyes
resolutely
to
the
coming
storm
as
the
cool
october
wind
stirred
the
leaves
at
her
feet
and
the
scarlet
and
gold
faded
in
the
west
she
rose
and
walked
slowly
homeward
she
was
too
deeply
pondering
her
speculative
doubts
to
notice
hartwell
buggy
whirling
along
the
street
did
not
see
his
head
extended
and
his
cold
searching
glance
and
of
course
he
believed
the
blindness
intentional
and
credited
it
to
pique
or
anger
on
reaching
home
she
endeavored
by
singing
a
favorite
hymn
to
divert
the
current
of
her
thoughts
but
the
shadows
were
growing
tenacious
and
would
not
be
banished
so
easily
if
a
man
die
shall
he
live
again
seemed
echoing
on
the
autumn
wind
she
took
up
her
bible
and
read
several
chapters
which
she
fancied
would
uncloud
her
mind
but
in
vain
restlessly
she
began
to
pace
the
floor
the
lamplight
gleamed
on
a
pale
troubled
face
after
a
time
the
door
opened
and
clara
came
in
she
took
a
seat
without
speaking
for
she
had
learned
to
read
beulah
countenance
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
she
was
abstracted
and
in
no
mood
for
conversation
when
the
tea
bell
rang
beulah
stopped
suddenly
in
the
middle
of
the
room
what
is
the
matter
asked
clara
i
feel
as
if
i
needed
a
cup
of
coffee
that
is
all
will
you
join
me
no
and
if
you
take
it
you
will
not
be
able
to
close
your
eyes
did
you
have
a
pleasant
ride
said
beulah
laying
her
hand
on
her
companion
shoulder
and
looking
gravely
down
into
the
sweet
face
which
wore
an
expression
she
had
never
seen
there
before
oh
i
shall
never
forget
it
never
murmured
clara
i
am
glad
you
enjoyed
it
very
glad
i
wish
the
color
would
come
back
to
your
cheeks
riding
is
better
for
you
now
than
walking
she
stooped
down
and
pressed
her
lips
to
the
wan
cheek
as
she
spoke
did
you
walk
this
evening
after
i
left
you
yes
what
makes
you
look
so
grave
a
great
many
causes
you
among
the
number
what
have
i
done
you
are
not
so
strong
as
i
should
like
to
see
you
you
have
a
sort
of
spiritual
look
that
i
do
at
all
fancy
i
dare
say
i
shall
soon
be
well
again
this
was
said
with
an
effort
and
a
sigh
quickly
followed
beulah
rang
the
bell
for
a
cup
of
coffee
and
taking
down
a
book
drew
her
chair
near
the
lamp
what
studying
already
cried
clara
impatiently
and
why
not
life
is
short
at
best
and
rarely
allows
time
to
master
all
departments
of
knowledge
why
should
i
not
seize
every
spare
moment
oh
beulah
though
you
are
so
much
younger
you
awe
me
i
told
your
guardian
that
you
were
studying
yourself
into
a
mere
shadow
he
smiled
and
said
you
were
too
willful
to
be
advised
you
talk
to
me
about
not
looking
well
you
never
have
had
any
color
and
lately
you
have
grown
very
thin
and
i
asked
the
doctor
if
he
did
not
think
you
were
looking
ill
and
he
said
that
you
had
changed
very
much
since
the
summer
beulah
for
my
sake
please
do
pore
over
your
books
so
incessantly
she
took
beulah
hand
gently
in
both
hers
want
of
color
is
as
constitutional
with
me
as
the
shape
of
my
nose
i
have
always
been
pale
and
study
has
no
connection
with
it
make
yourself
perfectly
easy
on
my
account
you
are
very
willful
as
your
guardian
says
cried
clara
impatiently
yes
that
is
like
my
sallow
complexion
constitutional
answered
beulah
laughing
and
opening
a
volume
of
carlyle
as
she
spoke
oh
beulah
i
do
know
what
will
become
of
you
tears
sprang
into
clara
eyes
do
not
be
at
all
uneasy
my
dear
clara
i
can
take
care
of
myself
chapter
xix
it
was
the
middle
of
november
and
the
absentees
who
had
spent
their
summer
at
the
north
were
all
at
home
again
among
these
were
asbury
and
her
two
daughters
and
only
a
few
days
after
their
return
they
called
to
see
beulah
she
found
them
polished
cultivated
and
agreeable
and
when
at
parting
the
mother
kindly
pressed
her
hand
and
cordially
invited
her
to
visit
them
often
and
sociably
she
felt
irresistibly
drawn
toward
her
and
promised
to
do
so
ere
long
there
came
a
friendly
note
requesting
her
to
spend
the
evening
with
them
and
thus
before
she
had
known
them
many
weeks
beulah
found
herself
established
on
the
familiar
footing
of
an
old
friend
universally
esteemed
and
respected
asbury
society
was
sought
by
the
most
refined
circle
of
the
city
and
his
house
was
a
favorite
resort
for
the
intellectual
men
and
women
of
the
community
occupying
an
enviable
position
in
his
profession
he
still
found
leisure
to
devote
much
of
his
attention
to
strictly
literary
topics
and
the
honest
frankness
and
cordiality
of
his
manners
blended
with
the
instructive
tone
of
his
conversation
rendered
him
a
general
favorite
asbury
merited
the
elevated
position
which
she
so
ably
filled
as
the
wife
of
such
a
man
while
due
attention
was
given
to
the
education
and
rearing
of
her
daughters
she
admirably
discharged
the
claims
of
society
and
by
a
consistent
adherence
to
the
principles
of
the
religion
she
professed
checked
by
every
means
within
her
power
the
frivolous
excesses
and
dangerous
extremes
which
prevailed
throughout
the
fashionable
circles
in
which
she
moved
zealously
yet
unostentatiously
she
exerted
herself
in
behalf
of
the
various
charitable
institutions
organized
to
ameliorate
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
in
their
midst
and
while
as
a
christian
she
conformed
to
the
outward
observances
of
her
church
she
faithfully
inculcated
and
practiced
at
home
the
pure
precepts
of
a
religion
whose
effects
should
be
the
proper
regulation
of
the
heart
and
charity
toward
the
world
her
parlors
were
not
the
favorite
rendezvous
where
gossips
met
to
retail
slander
refined
dignified
gentle
and
hospitable
she
was
a
woman
too
rarely
alas
met
with
in
fashionable
circles
her
husband
reputation
secured
them
the
acquaintance
of
all
distinguished
strangers
and
made
their
house
a
great
center
of
attraction
beulah
fully
enjoyed
and
appreciated
the
friendship
thus
tendered
her
and
soon
looked
upon
asbury
and
his
noble
wife
as
counselors
to
whom
in
any
emergency
she
could
unhesitatingly
apply
they
based
their
position
in
society
on
their
own
worth
not
the
extrinsic
appendages
of
wealth
and
fashion
and
readily
acknowledged
the
claims
of
all
who
however
humble
their
abode
or
avocation
proved
themselves
worthy
of
respect
and
esteem
in
their
intercourse
with
the
young
teacher
there
was
an
utter
absence
of
that
contemptible
supercilious
condescension
which
always
characterizes
an
ignorant
and
parvenu
aristocracy
they
treated
her
as
an
equal
in
intrinsic
worth
and
prized
her
as
a
friend
helen
asbury
was
older
than
beulah
and
georgia
somewhat
younger
they
were
gay
girls
lacking
their
intellectual
traits
but
sufficiently
and
cultivated
to
constitute
them
agreeable
companions
of
their
father
extensive
library
they
expressed
themselves
rather
afraid
and
frequently
bantered
beulah
about
the
grave
books
she
often
selected
from
it
beulah
found
her
school
duties
far
less
irksome
than
she
had
expected
for
she
loved
children
and
soon
became
interested
in
the
individual
members
of
her
classes
from
eight
until
three
she
was
closely
occupied
then
the
labors
of
the
day
were
over
and
she
spent
her
evenings
much
as
she
had
been
wont
ere
the
opening
of
the
session
thus
november
glided
quickly
away
and
the
first
of
december
greeted
her
ere
she
dreamed
of
its
approach
the
grahams
had
not
returned
though
daily
expected
and
notwithstanding
two
months
had
elapsed
without
eugene
writing
she
looked
forward
with
intense
pleasure
to
his
expected
arrival
there
was
one
source
of
constant
pain
for
her
in
hartwell
continued
and
complete
estrangement
except
a
cold
formal
bow
in
passing
there
was
no
intercourse
whatever
and
she
sorrowed
bitterly
over
this
seeming
indifference
in
one
to
whom
she
owed
so
much
and
was
so
warmly
attached
remotely
connected
with
this
cause
of
disquiet
was
the
painful
change
in
clara
like
a
lily
suddenly
transplanted
to
some
arid
spot
she
had
seemed
to
droop
since
the
week
of
her
ride
gentle
but
hopeless
and
depressed
she
went
day
after
day
to
her
duties
at
madam
cymon
school
and
returned
at
night
wearied
silent
and
wan
her
step
grew
more
feeble
her
face
thinner
and
paler
often
beulah
gave
up
her
music
and
books
and
devoted
the
evenings
to
entertaining
and
interesting
her
but
there
was
a
constraint
and
reserve
about
her
which
could
not
be
removed
one
evening
on
returning
from
a
walk
with
helen
asbury
beulah
ran
into
her
friend
room
with
a
cluster
of
flowers
clara
sat
by
the
fire
with
a
piece
of
needlework
in
her
hand
she
looked
listless
and
sad
beulah
threw
the
bright
golden
and
crimson
chrysanthemums
in
her
lap
and
stooping
down
kissed
her
warmly
saying
how
is
your
troublesome
head
here
is
a
flowery
cure
for
you
my
head
does
not
ache
quite
so
badly
where
did
you
find
these
beautiful
chrysanthemums
answered
clara
languidly
i
stopped
to
get
a
piece
of
music
from
georgia
and
helen
cut
them
for
me
oh
what
blessed
things
flowers
are
they
have
been
well
styled
undertones
of
encouragement
to
the
children
of
earth
she
was
standing
on
the
hearth
warming
her
fingers
clara
looked
up
at
the
dark
clear
eye
and
delicate
fixed
lips
before
her
and
sighed
involuntarily
beulah
knelt
on
the
carpet
and
throwing
one
arm
around
her
companion
said
earnestly
my
dear
clara
what
saddens
you
ca
you
tell
me
a
hasty
knock
at
the
door
gave
no
time
for
an
answer
a
servant
looked
in
is
miss
beulah
benton
here
there
is
a
gentleman
in
the
parlor
to
see
her
here
is
the
card
beulah
still
knelt
on
the
floor
and
held
out
her
hand
indifferently
the
card
was
given
and
she
sprang
up
with
a
cry
of
joy
oh
it
is
eugene
at
the
door
of
the
parlor
she
paused
and
pressed
her
hand
tightly
to
her
bounding
heart
a
tall
form
stood
before
the
grate
and
a
glance
discovered
to
her
a
dark
mustache
and
heavy
beard
still
it
must
be
eugene
and
extending
her
arms
unconsciously
she
exclaimed
eugene
eugene
have
you
come
at
last
he
started
looked
up
and
hastened
toward
her
her
arms
suddenly
dropped
to
her
side
and
only
their
hands
met
in
a
firm
tight
clasp
for
a
moment
they
gazed
at
each
other
in
silence
each
noting
the
changes
which
time
had
wrought
then
he
said
slowly
i
should
not
have
known
you
beulah
you
have
altered
surprisingly
his
eyes
wandered
wonderingly
over
her
features
she
was
pale
and
breathless
her
lips
trembled
violently
and
there
was
a
strange
gleam
in
her
large
eager
eyes
she
did
not
reply
but
stood
looking
up
intently
into
his
handsome
face
then
she
shivered
the
long
black
lashes
drooped
her
white
fingers
relaxed
their
clasp
of
his
and
she
sat
down
on
the
sofa
near
ah
her
womanly
intuitions
infallible
as
ithuriel
spear
told
her
that
he
was
no
longer
the
eugene
she
had
loved
so
devotedly
an
iron
hand
seemed
to
clutch
her
heart
and
again
a
shudder
crept
over
her
as
he
seated
himself
beside
her
saying
i
am
very
much
pained
to
find
you
here
i
am
just
from
hartwell
where
i
expected
to
see
you
he
paused
for
something
about
her
face
rather
disconcerted
him
and
he
took
her
hand
again
in
his
how
could
you
expect
to
find
me
there
after
reading
my
last
letter
i
still
hoped
that
your
good
sense
would
prevent
your
taking
such
an
extraordinary
step
she
smiled
icily
and
answered
is
it
so
extraordinary
then
that
i
should
desire
to
maintain
my
it
would
not
have
been
compromised
by
remaining
where
you
were
i
should
scorn
myself
were
i
willing
to
live
idly
on
the
bounty
of
one
upon
whom
i
have
no
claim
you
are
morbidly
fastidious
beulah
her
eyes
flashed
and
snatching
her
hand
from
his
she
asked
with
curling
lips
eugene
if
i
prefer
to
teach
for
a
support
why
should
you
object
simply
because
you
are
unnecessarily
lowering
yourself
in
the
estimation
of
the
community
you
will
find
that
the
circle
which
a
residence
under
hartwell
roof
gave
you
the
entree
of
will
look
down
with
contempt
upon
a
subordinate
teacher
in
a
public
school
then
thank
heaven
i
am
forever
shut
out
from
that
circle
is
my
merit
to
be
gauged
by
the
cost
of
my
clothes
or
the
number
of
fashionable
parties
i
attend
think
you
assuredly
beulah
the
things
you
value
so
lightly
are
the
standards
of
worth
and
gentility
in
the
community
you
live
in
as
you
will
unfortunately
find
she
looked
at
him
steadily
with
grief
and
scorn
and
wonder
in
her
deep
searching
eyes
as
she
exclaimed
oh
eugene
what
has
changed
you
so
since
the
bygone
years
when
in
the
asylum
we
talked
of
the
future
of
laboring
conquering
and
earning
homes
for
ourselves
oh
has
the
foul
atmosphere
of
foreign
lands
extinguished
all
your
selfrespect
do
you
come
back
sordid
and
sycophantic
and
the
slave
of
opinions
you
would
once
have
utterly
detested
have
you
narrowed
your
soul
and
bowed
down
before
the
miserable
standard
which
every
genuine
manly
spirit
must
loathe
oh
has
it
come
to
this
has
it
come
to
this
her
voice
was
broken
and
bitter
scalding
tears
of
shame
and
grief
gushed
over
her
cheeks
this
fierce
recrimination
and
unmerited
tirade
is
not
exactly
the
welcome
i
was
prepared
to
expect
returned
eugene
haughtily
and
rising
he
took
his
hat
from
the
table
she
rose
also
but
made
no
effort
to
detain
him
and
leaned
her
head
against
the
mantelpiece
he
watched
her
a
moment
then
approached
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
beulah
as
a
man
i
see
the
world
and
its
relations
in
a
far
different
light
from
that
in
which
i
viewed
it
while
a
boy
it
is
utterly
superfluous
to
tell
me
so
replied
beulah
bitterly
i
grapple
with
realities
now
and
am
forced
to
admit
the
expediency
of
prudent
policy
you
refuse
to
see
things
in
their
actual
existence
and
prefer
toying
with
romantic
dreams
beulah
i
have
awakened
from
these
since
we
parted
she
put
up
her
hand
deprecatingly
and
answered
then
let
me
dream
on
let
me
dream
on
beulah
i
have
been
sadly
mistaken
in
my
estimate
of
your
character
i
could
not
have
believed
there
was
so
much
fierce
obstinacy
so
much
stubborn
pride
in
your
nature
she
instantly
lifted
her
head
and
their
eyes
met
other
days
came
back
to
both
early
confidence
mutual
love
and
dependence
for
a
moment
his
nobler
impulses
prevailed
and
with
an
unsteady
lip
he
passed
his
arm
quickly
around
her
but
she
drew
coldly
back
and
said
it
seems
we
are
mutually
disappointed
in
each
other
i
regret
that
the
discharge
of
my
duty
should
so
far
conflict
with
your
opinions
and
standard
of
propriety
as
to
alienate
us
so
completely
as
it
seems
likely
to
do
all
my
life
i
have
looked
to
you
for
guidance
and
counsel
but
you
have
shaken
my
trust
and
henceforth
i
must
depend
upon
my
own
heart
to
support
me
in
my
work
oh
eugene
friend
of
my
childhood
beware
lest
you
sink
yourself
in
your
own
estimation
oh
for
days
and
months
and
years
i
have
pictured
the
hour
of
your
return
little
dreaming
that
it
would
prove
one
of
the
saddest
of
my
life
i
have
always
looked
up
to
you
oh
eugene
eugene
you
are
not
what
you
were
do
not
oh
do
not
make
me
pity
you
that
would
kill
me
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
shuddered
convulsively
i
am
not
so
changed
as
you
think
me
returned
eugene
proudly
then
in
earlier
years
i
was
miserably
deceived
in
your
character
for
the
sake
of
wealth
and
what
the
world
calls
you
have
sold
yourself
in
lieu
of
his
gold
and
influence
graham
has
your
will
your
conscience
ah
eugene
how
can
you
bear
to
be
a
mere
tool
in
his
hands
beulah
your
language
your
insinuations
are
unpardonable
by
heaven
no
one
but
yourself
might
utter
them
and
not
even
you
can
do
so
with
impunity
if
you
choose
to
suffer
your
foolish
pride
and
childish
whims
to
debar
you
from
the
enviable
position
in
society
which
hartwell
would
gladly
confer
on
you
why
you
have
only
yourself
to
censure
but
my
situation
in
graham
family
has
long
been
established
he
has
ever
regarded
me
as
his
son
treated
me
as
such
and
as
such
i
feel
bound
to
be
guided
by
him
in
my
choice
of
a
profession
beulah
i
have
loved
you
well
but
such
another
exhibition
of
scorn
and
bitterness
will
indeed
alienate
us
since
you
have
set
aside
my
views
and
counsel
in
the
matter
of
teaching
i
shall
not
again
refer
to
it
i
promise
you
i
have
no
longer
the
wish
to
control
your
actions
even
had
i
the
power
but
remember
since
the
hour
you
stood
beside
your
father
grave
leaning
on
me
i
have
been
constantly
your
friend
my
expostulations
were
for
what
i
considered
your
good
beulah
i
am
still
to
you
the
eugene
of
other
days
it
will
be
your
own
fault
if
the
sanctity
of
our
friendship
is
not
maintained
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
eugene
she
hastily
held
out
her
hand
he
clasped
it
in
his
and
as
if
dismissing
the
topics
which
had
proved
so
stormy
drew
her
to
a
seat
and
said
composedly
come
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
with
yourself
these
long
five
years
which
have
changed
you
so
i
have
heard
already
of
your
heroism
in
nursing
the
sick
during
the
late
awful
season
of
pestilence
and
death
for
an
hour
they
talked
on
indifferent
themes
each
feeling
that
the
other
was
veiling
the
true
impulses
of
the
heart
and
finally
eugene
rose
to
go
how
is
cornelia
health
now
asked
beulah
as
they
stood
up
before
the
fire
about
the
same
she
never
complains
but
does
not
look
like
herself
apropos
she
intrusted
a
note
to
me
for
you
which
i
had
quite
forgotten
here
it
is
miss
dupres
is
with
her
for
the
winter
at
least
a
part
of
it
cornelia
will
come
and
see
you
in
a
day
or
two
she
requested
me
to
say
and
i
do
hope
beulah
that
you
will
visit
her
often
she
has
taken
a
great
fancy
to
you
how
long
since
answered
beulah
with
an
incredulous
smile
since
she
met
you
at
a
concert
i
believe
by
the
way
we
are
very
musical
at
our
house
and
promise
ourselves
some
delightful
evenings
this
winter
you
must
hear
antoinette
dupres
sing
she
is
equal
to
the
best
of
italy
do
you
practice
much
yes
well
i
must
go
when
shall
i
see
you
again
whenever
you
feel
disposed
to
come
and
i
hope
that
will
be
often
eugene
you
were
a
poor
correspondent
see
that
you
prove
a
better
visitor
yes
i
will
i
have
a
thousand
things
to
say
but
scarcely
know
where
to
commence
you
are
always
at
home
in
the
evenings
i
suppose
yes
except
occasionally
when
i
am
with
the
asburys
do
you
see
much
of
them
yes
a
good
deal
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
they
move
in
the
very
first
circle
now
beulah
do
be
offended
if
i
ask
what
is
the
matter
with
hartwell
how
did
you
displease
him
just
as
i
displeased
you
by
deciding
to
teach
eugene
it
pains
me
very
much
that
he
should
treat
me
as
he
does
but
it
is
utterly
out
of
my
power
to
rectify
the
evil
he
told
me
that
he
knew
nothing
of
your
movements
or
plans
i
wish
for
your
sake
you
could
be
reconciled
we
will
be
some
day
i
must
wait
patiently
said
she
with
a
sigh
beulah
i
do
like
that
troubled
look
about
your
mouth
what
is
the
matter
can
i
in
any
way
remove
it
it
is
connected
with
me
even
remotely
my
dear
beulah
do
not
shrink
from
me
nothing
is
the
matter
that
you
can
rectify
said
she
gravely
something
is
the
matter
then
which
i
may
not
know
yes
and
you
will
not
trust
me
it
is
not
a
question
of
trust
eugene
you
think
i
can
not
help
you
you
can
not
help
me
i
am
sure
well
i
will
see
you
again
morrow
till
then
they
shook
hands
and
she
went
back
to
her
own
room
cornelia
note
contained
an
invitation
to
spend
the
next
evening
with
them
she
would
call
as
soon
as
possible
she
put
it
aside
and
throwing
her
arms
on
the
mantelpiece
bowed
her
head
upon
them
this
then
was
the
hour
which
for
five
years
she
had
anticipated
as
an
occasion
of
unmixed
delight
she
was
not
weeping
no
the
eyes
were
dry
and
the
lips
firmly
fixed
she
was
thinking
of
the
handsome
face
which
a
little
while
before
was
beside
her
thinking
with
keen
agony
of
footprints
there
which
she
had
never
dreamed
of
seeing
they
were
very
slight
yet
unmistakable
the
fell
signet
of
dissipation
above
all
she
read
it
in
the
eyes
which
once
looked
so
fearlessly
into
hers
she
knew
he
did
not
imagine
for
an
instant
that
she
suspected
it
and
of
all
the
bitter
cups
which
eighteen
years
had
proffered
this
was
by
far
the
blackest
it
was
like
a
hideous
dream
and
she
groaned
and
passed
her
hand
over
her
brow
as
if
to
sweep
it
all
away
poor
beulah
the
idol
of
her
girlhood
fell
from
its
pedestal
and
lay
in
crumbling
ruins
at
her
feet
in
this
hour
of
reunion
she
saw
clearly
into
her
own
heart
she
did
not
love
him
save
as
a
friend
as
a
brother
she
was
forced
to
perceive
her
own
superiority
could
she
love
a
man
whom
she
did
not
revere
verily
she
felt
now
that
she
did
not
love
eugene
there
was
a
feeling
of
contempt
for
his
weakness
yet
she
could
not
bear
to
see
him
other
than
she
had
hoped
how
utterly
he
had
disappointed
her
could
it
be
possible
that
he
had
fallen
so
low
as
to
dissipate
habitually
this
she
would
not
believe
he
was
still
too
noble
for
such
a
disgraceful
course
she
felt
a
soft
touch
on
her
shoulder
and
raised
her
sad
tearless
face
clara
with
her
ethereal
spiritual
countenance
stood
on
the
hearth
do
i
disturb
you
said
she
timidly
no
i
am
glad
you
came
i
was
listening
to
cold
bitter
bitter
thoughts
sit
down
clara
you
look
fatigued
oh
beulah
i
am
weary
in
body
and
spirit
i
have
no
energy
my
very
existence
is
a
burden
to
me
clara
it
is
weak
to
talk
so
rouse
yourself
and
fulfill
the
destiny
for
which
you
were
created
i
have
no
destiny
but
that
of
loneliness
and
misery
our
situations
are
similar
yet
i
never
repine
as
you
do
you
have
not
the
same
cause
you
are
need
no
society
to
conduce
to
your
happiness
your
heart
is
bound
up
in
your
books
where
yours
had
better
have
been
answered
beulah
she
walked
across
the
floor
several
times
then
said
impressively
as
she
threw
her
arm
round
clara
waist
crush
it
crush
it
if
you
crush
your
heart
in
the
effort
a
moan
escaped
clara
lips
and
she
hid
her
face
against
her
friend
shoulder
i
have
known
it
since
the
night
of
your
grandfather
death
if
you
want
to
be
happy
and
useful
crush
it
out
of
your
heart
i
have
tried
and
can
not
oh
but
you
can
i
tell
you
there
is
nothing
a
woman
can
not
do
provided
she
puts
on
the
armor
of
duty
and
unsheathes
the
sword
of
a
strong
unbending
will
of
course
you
can
do
it
if
you
will
wait
till
you
feel
as
i
do
beulah
and
it
will
not
seem
so
light
a
task
that
will
never
happen
if
i
live
till
the
next
geological
period
i
never
shall
love
anybody
as
insanely
as
you
love
why
clara
you
see
that
you
are
wrecking
your
happiness
what
strange
infatuation
has
seized
you
i
know
now
that
it
is
perfectly
hopeless
said
clara
calmly
you
might
have
known
it
from
the
first
no
it
is
but
recently
that
the
barrier
has
risen
what
barrier
asked
beulah
curiously
for
heaven
sake
beulah
do
not
mock
me
you
know
too
well
what
separates
us
yes
utter
uncongeniality
clara
raised
her
head
looked
into
the
honest
face
before
her
and
answered
if
that
were
all
i
could
yet
hope
to
merit
his
love
but
you
know
that
is
not
so
you
must
know
that
he
has
no
love
to
bestow
beulah
face
seemed
instantly
steeled
a
grayish
hue
crept
over
it
and
drawing
her
slender
form
to
its
full
height
she
replied
with
haughty
coldness
what
do
you
mean
i
can
only
conjecture
beulah
you
know
he
loves
you
cried
clara
with
a
strangely
quiet
smile
clara
sanders
never
say
that
again
as
long
as
you
live
for
there
is
not
the
shadow
of
truth
in
it
ah
i
would
not
believe
it
till
it
was
forced
upon
me
the
heart
bars
itself
a
long
time
to
painful
truths
i
have
looked
at
you
and
wondered
whether
you
could
be
ignorant
of
what
i
saw
so
clearly
i
believe
you
are
honest
in
what
you
say
i
know
that
you
are
but
it
is
nevertheless
true
i
saw
it
the
evening
i
went
to
ride
he
loves
you
whether
you
see
it
or
not
and
moreover
the
world
has
begun
to
join
your
names
i
have
heard
more
than
once
that
he
educated
you
with
the
intention
of
marrying
you
and
recently
it
has
been
rumored
that
the
marriage
would
take
place
very
soon
do
not
be
hurt
with
me
beulah
i
think
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
all
this
it
is
utterly
false
from
beginning
to
end
he
never
had
such
a
thought
never
never
cried
beulah
striking
her
clenched
hand
heavily
on
the
table
why
then
was
he
so
anxious
to
prevent
your
teaching
because
he
is
generous
and
kind
and
fancied
it
was
a
life
of
hardship
which
i
could
escape
by
accepting
his
offer
to
adopt
me
your
supposition
is
perfectly
ridiculous
he
is
double
my
age
a
stern
taciturn
man
what
could
possibly
attract
him
to
one
whom
he
looks
upon
as
a
mere
child
and
moreover
he
is
a
worshiper
of
beauty
now
it
is
an
indisputable
fact
that
i
am
anything
but
a
beauty
oh
the
idea
is
absurd
beyond
all
degree
never
mention
it
to
me
again
i
tell
you
solemnly
clara
your
jealous
fancy
has
run
away
with
your
common
sense
a
sad
incredulous
smile
flitted
over
clara
face
but
she
made
no
reply
clara
rouse
yourself
from
this
weak
dream
oh
where
is
your
pride
your
womanly
pride
your
is
your
life
to
be
aimless
and
dreary
because
of
an
unrequited
attachment
shake
it
off
rise
above
it
destroy
it
oh
it
makes
the
blood
tingle
in
my
veins
to
think
of
your
wasting
your
energies
and
hopes
in
love
for
one
who
is
so
utterly
indifferent
to
you
much
as
i
love
you
clara
had
i
the
power
to
make
you
his
wife
i
would
rather
see
you
borne
to
your
grave
you
know
nothing
of
his
fitful
moody
nature
his
tyrannical
will
you
could
not
be
happy
with
him
you
would
see
how
utterly
unsuited
you
are
are
you
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
his
early
life
and
marriage
asked
clara
in
a
low
passionless
tone
no
he
never
alluded
to
his
marriage
in
any
way
long
as
i
lived
in
his
house
there
was
no
mention
of
his
wife
name
and
i
should
never
have
known
of
his
marriage
but
from
his
sister
it
was
a
most
unhappy
marriage
said
clara
musingly
so
i
conjectured
from
his
studious
avoidance
of
all
allusion
to
it
his
wife
was
very
very
beautiful
i
saw
her
once
when
i
was
a
child
continued
clara
of
course
she
must
have
been
for
he
could
not
love
one
who
was
not
she
lived
but
a
few
months
yet
even
in
that
short
time
they
had
become
utterly
estranged
and
she
died
of
a
broken
heart
there
is
some
mystery
connected
with
it
they
were
separated
separated
cried
beulah
in
amazement
yes
separated
she
died
in
new
orleans
i
believe
and
yet
you
profess
to
love
him
a
man
who
broke
his
wife
heart
said
beulah
with
a
touch
of
scorn
no
you
do
his
noble
nature
injustice
he
is
incapable
of
such
a
course
even
a
censorious
world
acquitted
him
of
unkindness
and
heaped
contumely
on
the
unhappy
victim
eh
rejoined
beulah
her
conduct
was
not
irreproachable
it
has
been
whispered
aye
whispered
by
slanderous
tongues
not
openly
avowed
to
admit
of
denial
and
refutation
i
wonder
the
curse
of
gomorrah
does
not
descend
on
this
gossiping
libelous
community
no
one
seems
to
know
anything
definite
about
the
affair
though
i
have
often
heard
it
commented
upon
and
wondered
over
clara
let
it
be
buried
henceforth
neither
you
nor
i
have
any
right
to
discuss
and
censure
what
neither
of
us
know
anything
about
hartwell
has
been
my
best
and
truest
friend
i
love
and
honor
him
his
faults
are
his
own
and
only
his
maker
has
the
right
to
balance
his
actions
once
for
all
let
the
subject
drop
beulah
compressed
her
lips
with
an
expression
which
her
companion
very
well
understood
soon
after
the
latter
withdrew
and
leaning
her
arms
on
the
table
near
her
beulah
sank
into
a
reverie
which
was
far
from
pleasant
dismissing
the
unsatisfactory
theme
of
her
idiosyncrasies
her
thoughts
immediately
reverted
to
eugene
and
the
revolution
which
five
years
had
effected
in
his
character
in
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
she
was
engaged
with
her
drawing
when
a
succession
of
quick
raps
at
her
door
forced
an
impatient
come
in
from
her
lips
the
door
opened
and
she
rose
involuntarily
as
the
queenly
form
of
cornelia
graham
stood
before
her
with
a
slow
stately
tread
she
approached
and
extending
her
hand
said
unconcernedly
i
have
waived
ceremony
you
see
and
come
up
to
your
room
how
are
you
said
beulah
as
they
shook
hands
and
seated
themselves
just
as
usual
how
did
you
contrive
to
escape
the
plague
by
resolving
not
to
have
it
i
believe
you
have
a
wan
sickly
look
i
think
so
have
you
i
am
sure
i
hoped
that
you
would
come
home
strong
and
well
beulah
noted
with
a
feeling
of
compassion
the
thin
hollow
cheeks
and
sunken
yet
burning
eyes
before
her
cornelia
bit
her
lip
and
asked
haughtily
who
told
you
that
i
was
not
well
your
countenance
would
tell
me
if
i
had
never
heard
it
from
others
replied
beulah
with
an
instantaneous
recollection
of
her
guardian
warning
did
you
receive
my
note
yesterday
yes
i
am
obliged
by
your
invitation
but
can
not
accept
it
so
i
supposed
and
therefore
came
to
make
sure
of
you
you
are
too
proud
to
come
until
all
the
family
call
upon
you
eh
no
only
people
who
consider
themselves
inferior
are
on
the
watch
for
slights
and
scrupulously
exact
the
minutest
requirements
of
etiquette
on
the
plane
of
equality
these
barriers
melt
away
as
beulah
spoke
she
looked
steadily
into
the
searching
black
eyes
which
seemed
striving
to
read
her
soul
an
expression
of
pleasure
lighted
the
sallow
face
and
the
haughty
lines
about
the
beautiful
mouth
melted
into
a
then
you
have
not
forgiven
my
rudeness
during
early
schooldays
i
had
nothing
to
forgive
i
had
forgotten
the
affair
until
you
spoke
then
why
will
you
not
come
for
reasons
which
would
not
be
removed
by
a
recapitulation
and
you
positively
will
not
come
not
this
evening
another
time
i
certainly
will
come
with
pleasure
say
then
i
shall
be
engaged
where
excuse
my
pertinacity
at
asbury
i
have
promised
to
practice
some
duets
with
helen
do
you
play
well
beulah
are
you
a
good
musician
yes
cornelia
mused
a
moment
and
then
said
slowly
as
if
watching
the
effect
of
her
question
you
have
seen
eugene
of
course
yes
he
has
changed
very
much
in
his
appearance
has
he
not
more
than
i
was
prepared
to
expect
he
is
to
be
a
merchant
like
my
father
so
he
wrote
me
you
endeavored
to
dissuade
him
from
complying
with
my
wishes
did
you
not
yes
most
earnestly
answered
beulah
gravely
beulah
benton
i
like
you
you
are
honest
indeed
at
last
i
find
one
who
is
with
a
sudden
impulse
she
laid
her
white
jeweled
hand
on
beulah
is
honesty
or
rather
candor
so
very
rare
cornelia
come
out
from
your
of
retreat
into
the
world
and
you
can
easily
answer
your
own
question
you
seem
to
have
looked
on
human
nature
through
misanthropic
lenses
yes
i
bought
a
pair
of
spectacles
for
which
i
paid
a
most
exorbitant
price
but
they
were
labeled
she
smiled
frigidly
you
do
not
seem
to
have
enjoyed
your
tour
particularly
yes
i
did
but
one
is
glad
to
rest
sometimes
i
may
yet
prove
a
second
bayard
taylor
notwithstanding
i
should
like
you
for
a
companion
you
would
not
sicken
me
with
stereotyped
nonsense
her
delicate
fingers
folded
themselves
about
beulah
who
could
not
bring
herself
to
withdraw
her
hand
and
sure
enough
you
would
not
be
adopted
do
you
mean
to
adhere
to
your
determination
and
maintain
yourself
by
teaching
i
do
and
i
admire
you
for
it
beulah
you
must
get
over
your
dislike
to
me
i
do
not
dislike
you
cornelia
thank
you
for
your
negative
preference
returned
cornelia
rather
amused
at
her
companion
straightforward
manner
then
with
a
sudden
contraction
of
her
brow
she
added
i
am
not
so
bearish
as
they
give
me
credit
for
i
never
heard
you
called
so
ah
that
is
because
you
do
not
enter
the
enchanted
circle
of
clique
during
morning
calls
i
am
flattered
cajoled
and
fawned
upon
their
carriages
are
not
out
of
hearing
before
my
friends
and
admirers
like
hungry
harpies
pounce
upon
my
character
manners
and
appearance
with
most
laudable
zest
and
activity
wait
till
you
have
been
initiated
into
my
coterie
of
fashionable
friends
why
the
battle
of
marengo
was
a
farce
in
comparison
with
the
havoc
they
can
effect
in
the
space
of
a
morning
among
the
characters
of
their
select
visiting
list
what
a
precious
age
of
backbiting
we
city
belles
live
in
she
spoke
with
an
air
of
intolerable
scorn
as
a
prominent
member
of
this
circle
why
do
you
not
attempt
to
rectify
this
spreading
evil
you
might
effect
lasting
good
i
am
no
hercules
to
turn
the
peneus
of
reform
through
the
augean
realms
of
society
answered
cornelia
with
an
impatient
gesture
and
rising
she
drew
on
her
glove
beulah
looked
up
at
her
and
pitied
the
joyless
cynical
nature
which
gave
an
almost
repulsively
austere
expression
to
the
regular
faultless
features
beulah
will
you
come
on
saturday
morning
and
spend
an
hour
or
so
with
me
no
i
have
a
music
lesson
to
give
but
if
you
will
be
at
home
in
the
afternoon
i
will
come
with
pleasure
i
shall
expect
you
then
you
were
drawing
when
i
came
in
are
you
fond
of
it
as
she
spoke
she
took
up
a
piece
which
was
nearly
completed
yes
but
you
will
find
my
sketches
very
crude
who
taught
you
to
draw
i
have
had
several
teachers
all
rather
indifferent
however
where
did
you
see
a
cecilia
there
is
too
much
breadth
of
brow
here
continued
cornelia
with
a
curious
glance
at
the
young
teacher
yes
i
deviated
from
the
original
intentionally
i
copied
it
from
a
collection
of
heads
which
georgia
asbury
brought
from
the
north
i
have
a
number
of
choice
paintings
which
i
selected
in
europe
any
that
you
may
fancy
are
at
your
service
for
models
thank
you
i
shall
be
glad
to
avail
myself
of
the
privilege
you
will
come
saturday
yes
if
nothing
occurs
to
prevent
i
will
come
in
the
afternoon
beulah
pressed
her
offered
hand
and
saw
her
descend
the
steps
with
a
feeling
of
pity
which
she
could
not
exactly
analyze
passing
by
the
window
she
glanced
down
and
paused
to
look
upon
an
elegant
carriage
standing
before
the
door
the
day
was
cold
but
the
top
was
thrown
back
and
on
one
of
the
cushions
sat
or
rather
reclined
a
richly
dressed
and
very
beautiful
girl
as
beulah
leaned
out
to
examine
the
lovely
stranger
more
closely
cornelia
appeared
the
driver
opened
the
low
door
and
as
cornelia
stepped
in
the
young
lady
who
was
miss
dupres
of
course
ejaculated
rather
peevishly
you
stayed
an
age
drive
down
the
bay
road
wilson
was
cornelia
reply
and
as
she
folded
her
rich
cloak
about
her
the
carriage
was
whirled
away
beulah
went
back
to
the
fire
warmed
her
fingers
and
resumed
her
drawing
thinking
that
she
would
not
willingly
change
places
with
the
petted
child
of
wealth
and
luxury
chapter
xx
it
was
a
dreary
saturday
afternoon
but
beulah
wrapped
a
warm
shawl
about
her
and
set
out
to
pay
the
promised
visit
the
air
was
damp
and
raw
and
leaden
marbled
clouds
hung
in
the
sky
house
was
situated
in
the
fashionable
part
of
the
city
near
grayson
residence
and
as
beulah
passed
the
crouching
lions
she
quickened
her
steps
to
escape
the
painful
reminiscences
which
they
recalled
in
answer
to
her
ring
the
servant
ushered
her
into
the
parlors
furnished
with
almost
oriental
magnificence
and
was
retiring
when
she
gave
her
name
you
are
miss
benton
then
i
have
orders
to
show
you
up
at
once
to
miss
cornelia
room
she
has
seen
no
visitors
today
this
way
miss
if
you
please
he
led
the
way
up
an
easy
spiral
flight
of
steps
to
the
door
of
a
room
which
he
threw
open
cornelia
was
sitting
in
a
large
cushioned
chair
by
the
fire
with
a
beside
her
covered
with
letters
there
was
a
bright
fire
in
the
grate
and
the
ruddy
haze
together
with
the
reflection
from
the
crimson
damask
curtains
gave
a
dim
luxurious
aspect
to
the
chamber
which
in
every
respect
betokened
the
fastidious
taste
of
a
petted
invalid
clad
in
a
dark
silk
with
her
cheek
pressed
against
the
blue
velvet
lining
of
the
chair
cornelia
face
wore
a
sickly
sallow
hue
which
was
rendered
more
palpable
by
her
black
glittering
eyes
and
jetty
hair
she
eagerly
held
out
her
hand
and
a
smile
of
sincere
pleasure
parted
the
lips
which
a
paroxysm
of
pain
seemed
to
have
just
compressed
it
is
such
a
gloomy
day
i
feared
you
would
not
come
take
off
your
bonnet
and
shawl
it
is
not
so
gloomy
out
as
you
imagine
said
beulah
what
not
with
dull
clouds
and
a
stiff
raw
northeaster
i
looked
out
of
the
window
a
while
since
and
the
bay
looked
just
as
i
have
seen
the
north
sea
gray
and
cold
why
do
you
take
off
your
bonnet
because
i
can
only
sit
with
you
a
short
time
answered
beulah
resisting
the
attempt
made
to
take
her
shawl
why
ca
you
spend
the
evening
said
cornelia
frowning
i
promised
not
to
remain
more
than
an
hour
promised
whom
clara
sanders
she
is
sick
unable
to
leave
her
room
and
is
lonely
when
i
am
away
my
case
is
analogous
so
i
will
put
myself
on
the
charity
list
for
once
i
have
not
been
downstairs
for
two
days
but
you
have
everything
to
interest
you
even
here
returned
beulah
glancing
around
at
the
numerous
paintings
and
engravings
which
were
suspended
on
all
sides
while
ivory
marble
and
bronze
statuettes
were
scattered
in
profusion
about
the
room
cornelia
followed
her
glance
and
asked
with
a
joyless
smile
do
you
suppose
those
bits
of
stone
and
canvas
satisfy
me
certainly
thing
of
beauty
should
be
a
joy
forever
with
all
these
and
your
library
surely
you
are
never
lonely
pshaw
they
tire
me
immensely
sometimes
the
cramped
positions
and
unwinking
eyes
of
that
family
there
over
the
chimneypiece
make
me
perfectly
nervous
you
must
be
morbidly
sensitive
at
such
times
why
do
you
never
feel
restless
and
dissatisfied
without
any
adequate
reason
no
never
and
yet
you
have
few
sources
of
pleasure
said
cornelia
in
a
musing
tone
as
her
eyes
wandered
over
her
visitor
plain
attire
no
my
sources
of
enjoyment
are
as
varied
and
extended
as
the
universe
i
should
like
you
to
map
them
shut
up
all
day
with
a
parcel
of
rude
stupid
children
and
released
only
to
be
caged
again
in
a
small
room
in
a
boarding
house
really
i
should
fancy
they
were
limited
indeed
no
i
enjoy
my
brisk
walk
to
school
in
the
morning
the
children
are
neither
so
dull
nor
so
bearish
as
you
seem
to
imagine
i
am
attached
to
many
of
them
and
do
not
feel
the
day
to
be
very
long
at
three
i
hurry
home
get
my
dinner
practice
and
draw
or
sew
till
the
shadows
begin
to
dim
my
eyes
then
i
walk
until
the
lamps
are
lighted
find
numberless
things
to
interest
me
even
in
a
walk
and
go
back
to
my
room
refreshed
and
eager
to
get
to
my
books
once
seated
with
them
what
portion
of
the
earth
is
there
that
i
may
not
visit
from
the
crystal
arctic
temples
of
odin
and
thor
to
the
groves
of
abyssinia
in
this
age
of
travel
and
cheap
books
i
can
sit
in
my
room
in
the
third
story
and
by
my
lamplight
see
all
and
immeasurably
more
than
you
who
have
been
traveling
for
eighteen
months
wherever
i
go
i
find
sources
of
enjoyment
even
the
pictures
in
bookstores
give
me
pleasure
and
contribute
food
for
thought
and
when
as
now
i
am
surrounded
by
all
that
wealth
can
collect
i
admire
and
enjoy
the
beauty
and
elegance
as
much
as
if
i
owned
it
all
so
you
see
that
my
enjoyments
are
as
varied
as
the
universe
itself
eureka
murmured
cornelia
eying
her
companion
curiously
eureka
you
shall
have
the
tallest
case
in
the
british
museum
or
barnum
just
as
your
national
antipathies
may
incline
you
what
impresses
you
as
so
singular
in
my
mode
of
life
asked
beulah
rather
dryly
your
philosophic
contentment
which
i
believe
you
are
too
candid
to
counterfeit
your
easy
solution
of
that
great
human
riddle
given
the
world
to
find
happiness
the
athenian
and
alexandrian
schools
dwindle
into
nothingness
commend
me
to
your
o
queen
of
philosophy
she
withdrew
her
searching
eyes
and
fixed
them
moodily
on
the
fire
twirling
the
tassel
of
her
robe
as
she
mused
you
are
most
egregiously
mistaken
cornelia
if
you
have
been
led
to
suppose
from
what
i
said
a
moment
since
that
i
am
never
troubled
about
anything
i
merely
referred
to
enjoyments
derived
from
various
sources
open
alike
to
rich
and
poor
there
are
marahs
hidden
in
every
path
no
matter
whether
the
draught
is
taken
in
jeweled
goblets
or
unpolished
gourds
sometimes
then
you
are
most
dismally
like
the
balance
of
unphilosophic
men
and
women
eh
occasionally
my
mind
is
very
much
perplexed
and
disturbed
not
exactly
as
you
express
it
but
dimmed
clouded
what
clouds
it
will
you
tell
me
said
cornelia
eagerly
the
struggle
to
see
that
which
i
suppose
it
never
was
intended
i
should
see
i
do
understand
you
said
cornelia
knitting
her
brows
nor
would
you
even
were
i
to
particularize
perhaps
i
am
not
so
very
obtuse
as
you
fancy
at
any
rate
i
shall
not
enter
into
detail
answered
beulah
smiling
quietly
at
the
effect
of
her
words
do
you
ever
weary
of
your
books
cornelia
leaned
forward
and
bent
a
long
searching
look
on
her
guest
countenance
as
she
spoke
not
of
my
books
but
sometimes
nay
frequently
of
the
thoughts
they
excite
a
distinction
without
a
difference
said
the
invalid
coldly
a
true
distinction
nevertheless
maintained
beulah
be
good
enough
to
explain
it
then
for
instance
i
read
carlyle
for
hours
without
the
slightest
sensation
of
weariness
midnight
forces
me
to
lay
the
book
reluctantly
aside
and
then
the
myriad
conjectures
and
inquiries
which
i
am
conscious
of
as
arising
from
those
same
pages
weary
me
beyond
all
degrees
of
endurance
and
these
conjectures
cloud
your
mind
said
cornelia
with
a
smile
breaking
over
her
face
i
did
not
say
so
i
merely
gave
it
as
an
illustration
of
what
you
professed
not
to
understand
i
see
your
citadel
of
reserve
and
mistrust
can
not
be
carried
by
storm
answered
cornelia
petulantly
before
beulah
could
reply
a
servant
entered
and
addressed
cornelia
your
mother
wants
to
show
your
paris
hat
and
veil
and
handsomest
set
to
vincent
and
miss
julia
says
ca
she
run
up
and
see
you
a
minute
a
sneering
smile
accompanied
the
contemptuous
answer
which
was
delivered
in
no
particularly
gentle
manner
this
is
the
second
time
those
friends
of
ours
have
called
to
inspect
my
winter
outfit
take
down
my
entire
wardrobe
to
them
dresses
bonnets
mantles
laces
handkerchiefs
ribbons
shawls
nay
gloves
and
slippers
for
there
is
a
style
of
catch
on
one
and
of
bows
and
buckles
on
the
other
do
you
hear
me
mary
do
leave
a
rag
of
my
french
finery
behind
let
the
examination
be
sufficiently
complete
this
time
do
forget
the
indian
shawl
and
the
opera
cloak
and
hood
nor
that
ornamental
comb
named
after
the
last
popular
danseuse
and
tell
miss
julia
she
will
please
excuse
me
another
time
i
will
try
to
see
her
say
i
am
engaged
some
moments
elapsed
during
which
mary
opened
and
shut
a
number
of
drawers
and
boxes
and
finally
disappeared
staggering
beneath
a
load
of
silks
velvets
and
laces
as
the
door
closed
behind
her
cornelia
smoothed
her
brow
and
said
apologetically
doubtless
it
seems
a
mere
trifle
of
accommodation
to
display
all
that
mass
of
finery
to
their
eagerly
curious
eyes
but
i
assure
you
that
though
i
have
not
been
at
home
quite
a
week
those
things
have
vacated
their
places
at
least
twenty
times
for
inspection
and
this
ridiculous
mania
for
the
style
disgusts
me
beyond
measure
i
tell
you
the
majority
of
the
women
in
this
town
think
of
nothing
else
i
have
not
yet
looked
over
my
wardrobe
myself
mother
selected
it
in
paris
and
i
did
not
trouble
myself
to
examine
it
when
it
was
unpacked
beulah
smiled
but
offered
no
comment
cornelia
suddenly
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
said
hastily
give
me
that
vial
on
the
bureau
quick
quick
beulah
sprang
up
and
handed
her
the
vial
which
she
put
to
her
lips
she
was
ghastly
pale
her
features
writhed
and
heavy
drops
glistened
on
her
brow
corrugated
by
severe
pain
can
i
do
anything
for
you
cornelia
shall
i
call
your
mother
no
you
may
fan
me
if
you
will
she
moaned
and
closed
her
eyes
beulah
seized
a
fan
and
did
as
requested
now
and
then
wiping
away
the
moisture
which
gathered
around
the
lips
and
forehead
gradually
the
paroxysm
passed
off
and
opening
her
eyes
she
said
wearily
that
will
do
thank
you
now
pour
out
a
glass
of
water
from
the
pitcher
yonder
beulah
handed
her
the
draught
saying
with
surprise
sitting
wrapped
up
by
a
fire
and
drinking
yes
i
use
the
year
round
please
touch
the
bellrope
will
you
as
beulah
resumed
her
seat
cornelia
added
with
a
forced
laugh
you
look
as
if
you
pitied
me
i
do
most
sincerely
do
you
suffer
in
this
way
often
yes
no
well
when
i
am
prudent
i
do
then
turning
to
the
servant
who
stood
at
the
door
she
continued
john
go
to
hartwell
office
not
his
house
mind
you
and
leave
word
that
he
must
come
here
before
night
do
you
understand
shut
the
send
up
some
coal
she
drew
her
chair
closer
to
the
fire
and
extending
her
slippered
feet
on
the
marble
hearth
said
i
have
suffered
more
during
the
last
three
days
than
in
six
months
before
last
night
i
did
not
close
my
eyes
and
hartwell
must
prepare
me
some
medicine
what
is
the
matter
with
clara
sanders
she
looks
like
an
alabaster
image
she
has
never
recovered
entirely
from
that
attack
of
yellow
fever
and
a
day
or
two
ago
she
took
cold
and
has
had
constant
fever
since
i
suppose
she
will
see
the
doctor
while
i
am
here
i
feel
anxious
about
her
she
looks
ethereal
as
if
refined
for
a
translation
to
heaven
continued
cornelia
musingly
then
suddenly
lifting
her
head
she
listened
an
instant
and
exclaimed
angrily
it
is
very
strange
that
i
am
not
to
have
an
hour
peace
and
enjoyment
with
you
without
the
door
opened
and
a
graceful
form
and
lovely
face
approached
the
fireplace
miss
benton
suffer
me
to
introduce
my
cousin
miss
dupres
said
cornelia
very
coldly
the
young
lady
just
inclined
her
head
and
proceeded
to
scan
beulah
countenance
and
dress
with
a
degree
of
cool
impertinence
which
was
absolutely
amusing
evidently
however
cornelia
saw
nothing
amusing
in
this
stare
for
she
pushed
a
light
chair
impatiently
toward
her
saying
sit
down
antoinette
she
threw
herself
into
the
seat
with
a
sort
of
languid
grace
and
said
in
the
most
musical
of
voices
why
would
not
you
see
julia
vincent
she
was
so
much
disappointed
simply
and
solely
because
i
did
not
choose
to
see
her
be
good
enough
to
move
your
chair
to
one
side
if
you
please
snapped
cornelia
that
was
very
unkind
in
you
considering
she
is
so
fond
of
you
we
are
all
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
next
week
you
and
your
brother
and
i
a
mere
she
says
she
had
been
admiringly
inspecting
her
small
hands
loaded
with
diamonds
and
now
turning
round
she
again
freely
scrutinized
beulah
who
had
been
silently
contemplating
her
beautiful
oval
profile
and
silky
auburn
curls
certainly
antoinette
dupres
was
beautiful
but
it
was
such
a
beauty
as
one
sees
in
wax
dolls
blank
soulless
expressionless
if
i
may
except
the
predominating
expression
of
beulah
quiet
dignity
failed
to
repel
the
continued
stare
fixed
upon
her
and
gathering
up
the
folds
of
her
shawl
she
rose
do
go
said
cornelia
earnestly
i
must
clara
is
alone
and
i
promised
to
return
soon
when
will
you
come
again
cornelia
took
her
hand
and
pressed
it
warmly
i
really
do
not
know
i
hope
you
will
be
better
soon
eugene
will
be
disappointed
he
expects
you
to
spend
the
evening
with
us
what
shall
i
tell
him
nothing
i
will
come
and
see
you
the
very
first
day
i
can
get
out
of
this
of
mine
meantime
if
i
send
for
you
will
you
come
and
sit
with
me
that
depends
upon
circumstances
if
you
are
sick
and
lonely
i
certainly
will
beulah
the
haughty
heiress
drew
the
orphan
face
down
to
hers
and
kissed
her
cordially
not
a
little
surprised
by
this
unexpected
demonstration
of
affection
in
one
so
cold
and
stately
beulah
bowed
distantly
to
the
cousin
who
returned
the
salutation
still
more
distantly
and
hastening
down
the
steps
was
glad
to
find
herself
once
more
under
the
dome
of
sky
gray
and
rainy
though
it
was
the
wind
sighed
and
sobbed
through
the
streets
and
a
few
cold
drops
fell
as
she
approached
hoyt
quickening
her
steps
she
ran
in
by
a
side
entrance
and
was
soon
at
clara
room
the
door
stood
open
and
with
bonnet
and
shawl
in
her
hand
she
entered
little
prepared
to
meet
her
guardian
for
she
had
absented
herself
with
the
hope
of
avoiding
him
he
was
sitting
by
a
table
preparing
some
medicine
and
looked
up
involuntarily
as
she
came
in
his
eyes
lightened
instantly
but
he
merely
said
beulah
the
tone
was
less
icy
than
on
previous
occasions
and
crossing
the
room
at
once
she
stood
beside
him
and
held
out
her
hand
how
are
you
sir
he
did
not
take
the
hand
but
looked
at
her
keenly
and
said
you
are
an
admirable
nurse
to
go
off
and
leave
your
sick
friend
beulah
threw
down
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
retreating
to
the
hearth
began
to
warm
her
fingers
as
she
replied
with
indifference
i
have
just
left
another
of
your
patients
cornelia
graham
has
been
worse
than
usual
for
a
day
or
two
clara
i
will
put
away
my
outdoor
wrappings
and
be
with
you
presently
she
retired
to
her
own
room
and
leaning
against
the
window
where
the
rain
was
now
pattering
drearily
she
murmured
faintly
will
he
always
treat
me
so
have
i
lost
my
friend
forever
once
he
was
so
different
so
kind
even
in
his
sternness
a
tear
hung
upon
her
lash
and
fell
on
her
hand
she
brushed
it
hastily
away
and
stood
thinking
over
this
alienation
so
painful
and
unnatural
when
she
heard
her
guardian
close
clara
door
and
walk
across
the
hall
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
she
waited
a
while
until
she
thought
he
had
reached
his
buggy
and
slowly
proceeded
to
clara
room
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
floor
and
her
hand
was
already
on
the
bolt
of
the
door
when
a
deep
voice
startled
her
beulah
she
looked
up
at
him
proudly
resentment
had
usurped
the
place
of
grief
but
she
could
not
bear
the
earnest
eyes
that
looked
into
hers
with
such
misty
splendor
and
provoked
at
her
own
emotion
she
asked
coldly
what
do
you
want
sir
he
did
not
answer
at
once
but
stood
observing
her
closely
she
felt
the
hot
blood
rush
into
her
usually
cold
pale
face
and
despite
her
efforts
to
seem
perfectly
indifferent
her
eyelids
and
lips
would
tremble
his
hand
rested
lightly
on
her
shoulder
and
he
spoke
very
gently
child
have
you
been
ill
you
look
wretched
what
ails
you
beulah
nothing
sir
that
will
not
answer
tell
me
child
tell
me
i
tell
you
i
am
as
well
as
usual
cried
she
impatiently
yet
her
voice
faltered
she
was
struggling
desperately
with
her
own
heart
the
return
of
his
old
manner
the
winning
tones
of
his
voice
affected
her
more
than
she
was
willing
he
should
see
beulah
you
used
to
be
truthful
and
candid
i
am
so
still
she
returned
stoutly
though
tears
began
to
gather
in
her
eyes
no
child
already
the
world
has
changed
you
a
shadow
fell
over
his
face
and
the
sad
eyes
were
like
clouded
stars
you
know
better
sir
i
am
just
what
i
always
was
it
is
you
who
are
so
changed
once
you
were
my
friend
my
guardian
once
you
were
kind
and
guided
me
but
now
you
are
stern
and
bitter
and
tyrannical
she
spoke
passionately
and
tears
which
she
bravely
tried
to
force
back
rolled
swiftly
down
her
cheeks
his
light
touch
on
her
shoulder
tightened
until
it
seemed
a
hand
of
steel
and
with
an
expression
which
she
never
forgot
even
in
after
years
he
answered
tyrannical
not
to
you
child
yes
sir
tyrannical
cruelly
tyrannical
because
i
dared
to
think
and
act
for
myself
you
have
cast
off
utterly
you
try
to
see
how
cold
and
distant
you
can
be
and
show
me
that
you
do
care
whether
i
live
or
die
so
long
as
i
choose
to
be
independent
of
you
i
did
not
believe
that
you
could
ever
be
so
ungenerous
she
looked
up
at
him
with
swimming
eyes
he
smiled
down
into
her
tearful
face
and
asked
why
did
you
defy
me
child
i
did
not
sir
until
you
treated
me
worse
than
the
servants
worse
than
you
did
charon
even
how
how
indeed
you
left
me
in
your
own
house
without
one
word
of
when
you
expected
to
be
absent
an
indefinite
time
did
you
suppose
that
i
would
remain
there
an
hour
after
such
treatment
he
smiled
again
and
said
in
the
low
musical
tone
which
she
had
always
found
so
difficult
to
resist
come
back
my
child
come
back
to
me
never
sir
never
answered
she
resolutely
a
stony
hue
settled
on
his
face
the
lips
seemed
instantly
frozen
and
removing
his
hand
from
her
shoulder
he
said
as
if
talking
to
a
perfect
stranger
see
that
clara
sanders
needs
nothing
she
is
far
from
being
well
he
left
her
but
her
heart
conquered
for
an
instant
and
she
sprang
down
two
steps
and
caught
his
hand
pressing
her
face
against
his
arm
she
exclaimed
brokenly
oh
sir
do
not
cast
me
off
entirely
my
friend
my
guardian
indeed
i
have
not
deserved
this
he
laid
his
hand
on
her
bowed
head
and
said
calmly
fierce
proud
spirit
ah
it
will
take
long
years
of
trial
and
suffering
to
tame
you
go
beulah
you
have
cast
yourself
off
it
was
no
wish
no
work
of
mine
he
lifted
her
head
from
his
arm
gently
unclasped
her
fingers
and
walked
away
beulah
dried
the
tears
on
her
cheek
and
composing
herself
by
a
great
effort
returned
to
clara
the
latter
still
sat
in
an
and
leaned
back
with
closed
eyes
beulah
made
no
effort
to
attract
her
attention
and
sat
down
noiselessly
to
reflect
upon
her
guardian
words
and
the
separation
which
she
now
clearly
saw
he
intended
should
be
final
there
in
the
gathering
gloom
of
twilight
sat
clara
sanders
nerving
her
heart
for
the
dreary
future
solemnly
and
silently
burying
the
cherished
hopes
that
had
irised
her
path
and
now
looking
steadily
forward
to
coming
years
she
said
to
her
drooping
spirit
be
strong
and
bear
this
sorrow
i
will
conquer
my
own
heart
how
is
it
that
when
the
human
soul
is
called
to
pass
through
a
fierce
ordeal
and
numbing
despair
seizes
the
faculties
and
energies
in
her
sepulchral
grasp
how
is
it
that
superhuman
strength
is
often
suddenly
infused
into
the
sinking
spirit
there
is
a
mysterious
yet
resistless
power
given
which
winds
up
and
sets
again
in
motion
that
marvelous
bit
of
mechanism
the
human
will
that
curiously
intricate
combination
of
wheels
that
mainspring
of
action
which
has
baffled
the
ingenuity
of
philosophers
and
remains
yet
undiscovered
behind
the
cloudy
shrine
of
the
unknown
now
there
are
times
when
this
human
clock
runs
down
when
it
seems
that
volition
is
dead
when
the
past
is
all
gilded
the
future
all
shrouded
and
the
soul
grows
passive
hoping
nothing
fearing
nothing
yet
when
the
slowly
swinging
pendulum
seems
about
to
rest
even
then
an
unseen
hand
touches
the
secret
spring
and
as
the
curiously
folded
coil
quivers
on
again
the
resuscitated
will
is
lifted
triumphantly
back
to
its
throne
this
newborn
power
is
from
god
but
ye
wise
ones
of
earth
tell
us
how
and
by
whom
is
the
key
applied
are
ministering
angels
our
robed
idols
our
loved
dead
ordained
to
keep
watch
over
the
machinery
of
the
will
and
attend
to
the
winding
up
or
is
this
infusion
of
strength
whereby
to
continue
its
operations
a
sudden
tightening
of
those
invisible
cords
which
bind
the
to
the
spirits
he
has
created
truly
there
is
no
oedipus
for
this
vexing
riddle
many
luckless
theories
have
been
devoured
by
the
sphinx
when
will
metaphysicians
solve
it
one
tells
us
vaguely
enough
who
knows
the
mysteries
of
will
with
its
vigor
man
doth
not
yield
him
to
the
angels
nor
unto
death
utterly
save
only
through
the
weakness
of
his
feeble
will
this
pretty
bubble
of
a
latent
strength
has
vanished
the
power
is
from
god
but
who
shall
unfold
the
process
clara
felt
that
this
precious
help
was
given
in
her
hour
of
need
and
looking
up
undauntedly
to
the
clouds
that
darkened
her
sky
said
to
her
hopeless
heart
i
will
live
to
do
my
duty
and
god
work
on
eirth
i
will
go
bravely
forward
in
my
path
of
labor
strewing
flowers
and
sunshine
if
god
needs
a
lonely
chastened
spirit
to
do
his
behests
oh
shall
i
murmur
and
die
because
i
am
chosen
what
are
the
rushing
howling
waves
of
life
in
comparison
with
the
calm
shoreless
ocean
of
all
eternity
the
lamp
was
brought
in
and
the
fire
renewed
and
the
two
friends
sat
by
the
hearth
silent
quiet
clara
face
had
a
sweet
serene
look
beulah
was
composed
so
far
as
rigidity
of
features
betokened
yet
the
firm
curve
of
her
full
upper
lip
might
have
indexed
somewhat
of
the
confusion
which
reigned
in
her
mind
once
a
great
burning
light
flashed
out
from
her
eyes
then
the
lashes
drooped
a
little
and
veiled
the
storm
after
a
time
clara
lifted
her
eyes
and
said
gently
will
you
read
to
me
beulah
gladly
gladly
what
shall
it
be
she
sprang
up
eagerly
anything
hopeful
and
strengthening
anything
but
your
of
philosophy
and
metaphysics
anything
but
those
beulah
and
why
not
those
asked
the
girl
quickly
because
they
always
confuse
and
darken
me
you
do
not
understand
them
perhaps
i
understand
them
sufficiently
to
know
that
they
are
not
what
i
need
what
do
you
need
clara
the
calm
content
and
courage
to
do
my
duty
through
life
i
want
to
be
patient
and
useful
the
gray
eyes
rested
searchingly
on
the
sweet
face
and
then
with
a
contracted
brow
beulah
stepped
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
night
was
gusty
dark
and
rainy
heavy
drops
pattered
briskly
down
the
panes
she
turned
away
and
standing
on
the
hearth
with
her
hands
behind
her
slowly
repeated
the
beautiful
lines
beginning
day
is
done
and
the
darkness
falls
from
the
wings
of
night
as
a
feather
is
wafted
downward
from
an
eagle
in
his
flight
her
voice
was
low
and
musical
and
as
she
concluded
the
short
poem
which
seemed
so
singularly
suited
to
clara
wishes
the
latter
said
earnestly
yes
yes
beulah
songs
have
power
to
quiet
the
restless
pulse
of
care
and
come
like
the
benediction
that
follows
after
prayer
let
us
obey
the
poet
injunction
and
realize
the
closing
lines
the
night
shall
be
filled
with
music
and
the
cares
that
infest
the
day
shall
fold
their
tents
like
the
arabs
and
as
silently
steal
away
still
beulah
stood
on
the
hearth
with
a
dreamy
abstraction
looking
out
from
her
eyes
and
when
she
spoke
there
was
a
touch
of
impatience
in
her
tone
why
try
to
escape
it
all
clara
if
those
old
masters
those
sublime
who
tell
us
in
of
endless
toil
and
endeavor
speak
to
you
through
my
loved
books
why
should
you
for
rest
an
unfledged
birdling
can
not
mount
to
the
dizzy
eyries
of
the
eagle
answered
clara
meekly
one
grows
strong
only
by
struggling
with
difficulties
strong
swimmers
are
such
from
fierce
buffetings
with
hungry
waves
come
out
of
your
warm
nest
of
inertia
strengthen
your
wings
by
battling
with
storm
and
wind
her
brow
bent
as
she
spoke
beulah
what
sustains
you
would
starve
me
something
has
come
over
you
clara
yes
a
great
trust
in
god
wisdom
and
mercy
has
stolen
into
my
heart
i
no
longer
look
despondingly
into
my
future
why
because
you
fancy
that
future
will
be
very
short
and
painless
ah
clara
is
this
trust
when
the
end
comes
and
there
is
no
more
work
to
do
you
are
mistaken
i
do
not
see
death
beckoning
me
home
oh
i
have
not
earned
a
home
yet
i
look
forward
to
years
of
labor
profit
and
peace
i
found
some
lines
in
the
morning
paper
nay
curl
your
lips
with
a
sneer
at
what
you
call
poetry
listen
to
the
words
that
came
like
a
message
from
the
to
my
murmuring
heart
her
voice
was
low
and
unsteady
as
she
read
hands
upon
the
breast
and
labor
done
two
pale
feet
crossed
in
rest
the
race
is
won
two
eyes
with
shut
all
tears
cease
two
lips
where
grief
is
mute
and
wrath
at
peace
so
pray
we
oftentimes
mourning
our
lot
god
in
his
kindness
answereth
not
such
beulah
i
felt
had
been
my
unvoiced
prayer
but
now
hands
to
work
addressed
aye
for
his
praise
two
feet
that
never
rest
walking
his
ways
two
eyes
that
look
above
still
through
all
tears
two
lips
that
breathe
but
love
never
more
fears
so
we
cry
afterward
low
at
our
knees
pardon
those
erring
cries
father
hear
these
oh
beulah
such
is
now
my
prayer
as
beulah
stood
near
the
lamp
strange
shadows
fell
on
her
brow
shadows
from
the
long
curling
lashes
after
a
brief
silence
she
asked
earnestly
are
your
prayers
answered
clara
does
god
hear
you
yes
oh
yes
wherefore
because
christ
died
is
your
faith
in
christ
so
firm
does
it
never
waver
never
even
in
my
most
desponding
moments
beulah
looked
at
her
keenly
and
asked
with
something
like
a
shiver
did
it
never
occur
to
you
to
doubt
the
plan
of
redemption
as
taught
by
divines
as
laid
down
in
the
new
testament
no
never
i
want
to
die
before
such
a
doubt
occurs
to
me
oh
what
would
my
life
be
without
that
plan
what
would
a
fallen
world
be
without
a
jesus
but
why
curse
a
race
in
order
to
necessitate
a
saviour
clara
looked
in
astonishment
at
the
pale
fixed
features
before
her
a
frightened
expression
came
over
her
own
countenance
a
look
of
shuddering
horror
and
putting
up
her
wasted
hands
as
if
to
ward
off
some
grim
phantom
she
cried
oh
beulah
what
is
this
you
are
not
an
infidel
her
companion
was
silent
a
moment
then
said
emphatically
hartwell
does
not
believe
the
religion
you
hold
so
dear
clara
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
answered
brokenly
beulah
i
have
envied
you
because
i
fancied
that
your
superior
intellect
won
you
the
love
which
i
was
weak
enough
to
expect
and
need
but
if
it
has
brought
you
both
to
doubt
the
bible
i
thank
god
that
the
fatal
gift
was
withheld
from
me
have
your
books
and
studies
brought
you
to
this
beulah
beulah
throw
them
into
the
fire
and
come
back
to
trust
in
christ
she
held
out
her
hands
imploringly
but
with
a
singularly
cold
smile
her
friend
replied
you
must
go
to
sleep
your
fever
is
rising
do
talk
any
more
night
i
will
not
hear
you
an
hour
after
clara
slept
soundly
and
beulah
sat
in
her
own
room
bending
over
a
book
midnight
study
had
long
since
become
an
habitual
thing
nay
two
and
three
frequently
found
her
beside
the
waning
lamp
was
it
any
marvel
that
as
hartwell
expressed
it
she
looked
wretched
from
her
earliest
childhood
she
had
been
possessed
by
an
active
spirit
of
inquiry
which
constantly
impelled
her
to
investigate
and
as
far
as
possible
to
explain
the
mysteries
which
surrounded
her
on
every
side
with
her
growth
grew
this
haunting
spirit
which
asked
continually
what
am
i
whence
did
i
come
and
whither
am
i
bound
what
is
life
what
is
death
am
i
my
own
mistress
or
am
i
but
a
tool
in
the
hands
of
my
maker
what
constitutes
the
difference
between
my
mind
and
my
body
is
there
any
difference
if
spirit
must
needs
have
body
to
incase
it
and
body
must
have
a
spirit
to
animate
it
may
they
not
be
identical
with
these
primeval
foundation
questions
began
her
speculative
career
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
soul
she
struggled
bravely
and
earnestly
to
answer
those
dread
questions
which
like
swords
of
flaming
fire
tokens
of
imprisonment
encompass
man
on
earth
of
course
mystery
triumphed
panting
for
the
truth
she
pored
over
her
bible
supposing
that
here
at
least
all
clouds
would
melt
away
but
here
too
some
inexplicable
passages
confronted
her
physically
morally
and
mentally
she
found
the
world
warring
to
reconcile
these
antagonisms
with
the
conditions
and
requirements
of
holy
writ
she
now
most
faithfully
set
to
work
ah
proudly
aspiring
soul
how
many
earnest
thinkers
had
essayed
the
same
mighty
task
and
died
under
the
intolerable
burden
unluckily
for
her
there
was
no
one
to
direct
or
assist
her
she
scrupulously
endeavored
to
conceal
her
doubts
and
questions
from
her
guardian
poor
child
she
fancied
she
concealed
them
so
effectually
from
his
knowledge
while
he
silently
noted
the
march
of
skepticism
in
her
nature
there
were
dim
puzzling
passages
of
scripture
which
she
studied
on
her
knees
now
trying
to
comprehend
them
and
now
beseeching
the
source
of
all
knowledge
to
enlighten
her
but
as
has
happened
to
numberless
others
there
was
seemingly
no
assistance
given
the
clouds
grew
denser
and
darker
and
like
the
cry
of
strong
swimmers
in
their
agony
her
prayers
had
gone
up
to
the
throne
of
grace
sometimes
she
was
tempted
to
go
to
the
minister
of
the
church
where
she
sat
sunday
after
sunday
and
beg
him
to
explain
the
mysteries
to
her
but
the
pompous
austerity
of
his
manners
repelled
her
whenever
she
thought
of
broaching
the
subject
and
gradually
she
saw
that
she
must
work
out
her
own
problems
thus
from
week
to
week
and
month
to
month
she
toiled
on
with
a
slowly
dying
faith
constantly
clambering
over
obstacles
which
seemed
to
stand
between
her
trust
and
revelation
it
was
no
longer
study
for
the
sake
of
erudition
these
riddles
involved
all
that
she
prized
in
time
and
eternity
and
she
grasped
books
of
every
description
with
the
eagerness
of
a
famishing
nature
what
dire
chance
threw
into
her
hands
such
works
as
emerson
carlyle
and
goethe
like
the
waves
of
the
clear
sunny
sea
they
only
increased
her
thirst
to
madness
her
burning
lips
were
ever
at
these
fountains
and
in
her
reckless
eagerness
she
plunged
into
the
gulf
of
german
speculation
here
she
believed
that
she
had
indeed
found
the
true
processes
and
with
renewed
zest
continued
the
work
of
questioning
at
this
stage
of
the
conflict
the
pestilential
scourge
was
laid
upon
the
city
and
she
paused
from
her
metaphysical
toil
to
close
glazed
eyes
and
shroud
soulless
clay
in
the
awful
hush
of
those
hours
of
watching
she
looked
calmly
for
some
solution
and
longed
for
the
unquestioning
faith
of
early
years
but
these
influences
passed
without
aiding
her
in
the
least
and
with
rekindled
ardor
she
went
back
to
her
false
prophets
in
addition
ethnology
beckoned
her
on
to
conclusions
apparently
antagonistic
to
the
revealed
system
and
the
stony
face
of
geology
seemed
radiant
with
characters
of
light
which
she
might
decipher
and
find
some
security
in
from
asbury
extensive
collection
she
snatched
treatise
after
treatise
the
sages
of
geology
talked
of
the
eras
and
of
man
ending
the
slowly
forged
chain
of
which
the
radiata
form
the
lowest
link
and
then
she
was
told
that
in
those
ages
paleontologists
find
no
trace
whatever
of
that
golden
time
when
the
vast
animal
creation
lived
in
harmony
and
bloodshed
was
unknown
ergo
man
fall
in
eden
had
no
agency
in
bringing
death
into
the
world
ergo
that
chapter
in
genesis
need
puzzle
her
no
more
finally
she
learned
that
she
was
the
crowning
intelligence
in
the
vast
progression
that
she
would
ultimately
become
part
of
deity
the
long
ascending
line
from
dead
matter
to
man
had
been
a
progress
godward
and
the
next
advance
would
unite
creation
and
creator
in
one
person
with
all
her
aspirations
she
had
never
dreamed
of
such
a
future
as
was
here
promised
her
she
was
closely
following
that
most
anomalous
of
all
guides
herr
teufelsdrockh
urged
on
by
the
same
unrest
she
was
stumbling
along
dim
devious
paths
while
from
every
side
whispers
came
to
her
nature
is
one
she
is
your
mother
and
divine
she
is
god
the
garment
of
god
through
the
everlasting
no
and
the
everlasting
yea
she
groped
her
way
darkly
tremblingly
waiting
for
the
of
truth
to
dawn
but
at
last
when
she
fancied
she
saw
the
first
rays
silvering
the
night
and
looked
up
hopefully
it
proved
one
of
many
which
had
flashed
across
her
path
and
she
saw
that
it
was
goethe
uplifted
as
the
prophet
of
the
genuine
religion
the
book
fell
from
her
nerveless
fingers
she
closed
her
eyes
and
groaned
it
was
all
confusion
worse
confounded
she
could
not
for
her
life
have
told
what
she
believed
much
less
what
she
did
not
believe
the
landmarks
of
earlier
years
were
swept
away
the
beacon
light
of
calvary
had
sunk
below
her
horizon
a
howling
chaos
seemed
about
to
ingulf
her
at
that
moment
she
would
gladly
have
sought
assistance
from
her
guardian
but
how
could
she
approach
him
after
their
last
interview
the
friendly
face
and
cordial
kindness
of
asbury
flashed
upon
her
memory
and
she
resolved
to
confide
her
doubts
and
difficulties
to
him
hoping
to
obtain
from
his
clear
and
matured
judgment
some
clew
which
might
enable
her
to
emerge
from
the
labyrinth
that
involved
her
she
knelt
and
tried
to
pray
to
what
did
she
on
bended
knees
send
up
passionate
supplications
to
nature
to
heroes
these
were
the
new
deities
she
could
not
pray
all
grew
dark
she
pressed
her
hands
to
her
throbbing
brain
striving
to
clear
away
the
mists
sartor
had
effectually
blindfolded
her
and
she
threw
herself
down
to
sleep
with
a
shivering
dread
as
of
a
young
child
separated
from
its
mother
and
wailing
in
some
starless
desert
chapter
xxi
it
was
christmas
eve
cold
cloudy
and
damp
the
store
windows
were
gay
with
every
conceivable
and
inconceivable
device
for
attracting
attention
parents
nurses
and
porters
hurried
along
with
mysterious
looking
bundles
and
important
countenances
crowds
of
curious
merry
children
thronged
the
sidewalks
here
a
thinly
clad
meager
boy
looked
with
longing
eyes
and
empty
pockets
at
pyramids
of
fruit
and
sweetmeats
and
there
a
richly
dressed
group
chattered
like
blackbirds
and
occasionally
fired
a
pack
of
crackers
to
the
infinite
dismay
of
horses
and
drivers
little
chaps
just
out
of
frocks
rushed
about
with
their
round
rosy
faces
hid
under
grotesque
masks
and
shouts
of
laughter
and
the
squeak
of
penny
trumpets
and
mutter
of
miniature
drums
swelled
to
a
continuous
din
which
would
have
been
quite
respectable
even
on
the
plain
of
shinar
the
annual
jubilee
had
come
and
young
and
old
seemed
determined
to
celebrate
it
with
due
zeal
from
her
window
beulah
looked
down
on
the
merry
groups
and
involuntarily
contrasted
the
bustling
crowded
streets
with
the
silence
and
desolation
which
had
reigned
over
the
same
thoroughfares
only
a
few
months
before
one
brief
year
ago
childish
voices
prattled
of
santa
claus
and
gift
stockings
and
little
feet
pattered
along
these
same
pavements
with
tiny
hands
full
of
toys
fond
parents
too
had
gone
eagerly
in
and
out
of
these
gay
shops
hunting
presents
for
their
darlings
where
were
they
children
and
parents
ah
a
cold
silent
band
of
sleepers
in
yonder
necropolis
where
solemn
cedars
were
chanting
an
everlasting
dirge
death
harvest
time
was
in
all
seasons
when
would
her
own
throbbing
pulses
be
stilled
and
her
questioning
tones
hushed
might
not
the
summons
be
on
that
very
wintry
blast
which
rushed
over
her
hot
brow
and
if
it
should
be
so
beulah
pressed
her
face
closer
to
the
window
and
thought
it
was
too
inconceivable
that
she
also
should
die
she
knew
it
was
the
common
birthright
the
one
unchanging
heritage
of
all
humanity
yet
long
vistas
of
life
opened
before
her
and
though
like
a
pall
the
shadow
of
the
tomb
hung
over
the
end
it
was
very
distant
very
dim
what
makes
you
look
so
solemn
asked
clara
who
had
been
busily
engaged
in
dressing
a
doll
for
one
of
hoyt
children
because
i
feel
solemn
i
suppose
clara
came
up
and
passing
her
arm
round
beulah
shoulder
gazed
down
into
the
noisy
street
she
still
wore
mourning
and
the
alabaster
fairness
of
her
complexion
contrasted
vividly
with
the
black
bombazine
dress
though
thin
and
pale
there
was
an
indescribable
expression
of
peace
on
the
sweet
face
a
calm
clear
light
of
contentment
in
the
mild
brown
eyes
the
holy
serenity
of
the
countenance
was
rendered
more
apparent
by
the
restless
stormy
visage
of
her
companion
every
passing
cloud
of
perplexed
thought
cast
its
shadow
over
beulah
face
and
on
this
occasion
she
looked
more
than
usually
grave
ah
how
merry
i
used
to
be
on
christmas
eve
indeed
i
can
remember
having
been
half
wild
with
excitement
yet
now
it
all
seems
like
a
flitting
dream
clara
spoke
musingly
yet
without
sadness
time
has
laid
his
touch
upon
you
answered
beulah
how
is
it
beulah
that
you
never
speak
of
your
childhood
because
it
was
all
dark
and
barren
as
a
rainy
sea
but
you
never
talk
about
your
parents
i
love
my
father
memory
ah
it
is
enshrined
in
my
holiest
sanctuary
he
was
a
noble
loving
man
and
my
affection
for
him
bordered
on
idolatry
and
your
mother
i
knew
little
of
her
she
died
before
i
was
old
enough
to
remember
much
about
her
her
face
was
full
of
bitter
recollections
her
eyes
seemed
wandering
through
some
storehouse
of
sorrows
clara
feared
her
friend
much
as
she
loved
her
and
since
the
partial
discovery
of
her
skepticism
she
had
rather
shunned
her
society
now
she
watched
the
heavy
brow
and
deep
piercing
eyes
uneasily
and
gently
withdrawing
her
arm
she
glided
out
of
the
room
the
tide
of
life
still
swelled
through
the
streets
and
forcibly
casting
the
load
of
painful
reminiscences
from
her
beulah
kept
her
eyes
on
the
merry
faces
and
listened
to
the
gay
careless
prattle
of
the
excited
children
the
stately
rustle
of
brocaded
silk
caused
her
to
look
up
and
cornelia
graham
greeted
her
with
i
have
come
to
take
you
home
with
me
for
the
holidays
i
ca
go
why
not
you
cling
to
this
dark
garret
of
yours
as
if
it
possessed
all
the
charms
of
vaucluse
diogenes
loved
his
tub
you
know
said
beulah
quietly
an
analogous
case
truly
but
jesting
aside
you
must
come
beulah
eugene
expects
you
so
do
my
parents
and
above
all
i
want
you
come
cornelia
laid
her
hand
on
the
girl
shoulders
as
she
spoke
you
have
been
ill
again
said
beulah
examining
the
sallow
face
not
ill
but
i
shall
be
soon
i
know
one
of
my
old
attacks
is
coming
on
i
feel
it
and
beulah
to
be
honest
which
i
can
with
you
without
casting
pearls
before
swine
that
very
circumstance
makes
me
want
you
i
dined
out
and
have
just
left
the
fashionable
crowd
to
come
and
ask
you
to
spend
the
holidays
with
me
the
house
will
be
gay
antoinette
intends
to
have
a
set
of
tableaux
but
it
is
probable
i
shall
be
confined
to
my
room
will
you
give
your
time
to
a
cross
invalid
for
such
i
certainly
am
i
would
be
stretched
upon
lawrence
gridiron
before
i
could
be
brought
to
say
as
much
to
anybody
else
i
am
not
accustomed
to
ask
favors
beulah
it
has
been
my
habit
to
grant
them
nevertheless
i
want
you
and
am
not
too
proud
to
come
after
you
will
you
come
yes
if
i
may
remain
with
you
altogether
thank
you
come
get
ready
quick
give
me
a
fan
sinking
into
a
chair
she
wiped
away
the
cold
drops
which
had
collected
about
her
brow
cornelia
i
have
only
one
day
leisure
school
begins
again
day
after
well
well
one
day
then
be
quick
in
a
few
moments
beulah
was
ready
and
after
informing
clara
and
hoyt
of
her
intended
absence
the
two
entered
elegant
carriage
the
gas
was
now
lighted
and
the
spirited
horses
dashed
along
through
streets
brilliantly
illuminated
and
thronged
with
happy
people
what
a
babel
about
equal
to
constantinople
and
its
orchestra
muttered
cornelia
as
the
driver
paused
to
allow
one
of
the
military
companies
to
pass
the
martial
music
together
with
the
hubbub
which
otherwise
prevailed
alarmed
the
horses
and
they
plunged
violently
the
driver
endeavored
to
back
out
into
an
alley
but
in
the
attempt
the
carriage
was
whirled
round
the
coachman
jerked
over
the
dashboard
into
the
gutter
and
the
frightened
animals
dashed
at
furious
speed
down
the
main
street
luckily
the
top
was
thrown
back
making
the
carriage
open
and
springing
forward
to
the
post
so
unceremoniously
vacated
by
the
driver
beulah
snatched
the
reins
which
were
just
within
her
reach
curb
the
rushing
horses
she
did
not
hope
to
do
but
by
cautious
energy
succeeded
in
turning
them
sufficiently
aside
to
avoid
coming
in
collision
with
several
other
carriages
the
street
was
full
of
vehicles
and
though
as
may
well
be
imagined
there
was
every
effort
made
to
give
the
track
the
carriage
rushed
against
the
bright
yellow
wheels
of
a
light
buggy
in
which
two
young
men
were
trying
to
manage
a
fast
trotter
there
was
a
terrible
smash
of
wheels
the
young
gentlemen
were
suddenly
landed
in
the
mud
and
their
emancipated
steed
galloped
on
with
the
wreck
of
the
buggy
at
his
heels
men
women
and
children
gathered
on
the
corners
to
witness
the
denouement
drays
carts
and
wagons
were
seized
with
a
simultaneous
stampede
which
soon
cleared
the
middle
of
the
street
and
uninjured
by
the
collision
our
carriage
flew
on
cornelia
sat
on
the
back
seat
ghastly
pale
and
motionless
expecting
every
minute
to
be
hurled
out
while
beulah
stood
up
in
front
reins
in
hand
trying
to
guide
the
maddened
horses
her
bonnet
fell
off
the
motion
loosened
her
comb
and
down
came
her
long
heavy
hair
in
black
blinding
folds
she
shook
it
all
back
from
her
face
and
soon
saw
that
this
reckless
game
of
dodging
vehicles
could
not
last
much
longer
straight
ahead
at
the
end
of
the
street
was
the
wharf
crowded
with
cotton
bales
barrels
and
a
variety
of
freight
just
beyond
was
the
river
a
number
of
gentlemen
stood
on
a
neighboring
corner
and
with
one
impulse
they
rushed
forward
with
extended
arms
on
sprang
the
horses
almost
upon
them
eager
hands
grasped
at
the
bits
stand
of
you
you
might
as
well
catch
at
the
winds
shouted
beulah
and
with
one
last
effort
she
threw
her
whole
weight
on
the
reins
and
turned
the
horses
into
a
cross
street
the
wheels
struck
the
curbstone
the
carriage
tilted
rocked
fell
back
again
and
on
they
went
for
three
squares
more
when
the
horses
stopped
short
before
the
livery
stable
where
they
were
kept
embossed
with
foam
and
panting
like
stags
at
bay
they
were
seized
by
a
dozen
hands
by
all
the
gods
of
greece
you
have
had
a
flying
trip
of
it
cried
asbury
with
one
foot
on
the
carriage
step
and
both
hands
extended
while
his
gray
hair
hung
in
confusion
about
his
face
he
had
followed
them
for
at
least
half
a
dozen
blocks
and
was
pale
with
anxiety
see
about
cornelia
said
beulah
seating
herself
for
the
first
time
and
twisting
up
the
veil
of
hair
which
swept
round
her
form
cornelia
has
fainted
halloo
there
some
water
quick
said
the
doctor
stepping
into
the
carriage
and
attempting
to
lift
the
motionless
figure
but
cornelia
opened
her
eyes
and
answered
unsteadily
no
carry
me
home
asbury
take
me
home
the
brilliant
eyes
closed
a
sort
of
spasm
distorted
her
features
and
she
sank
back
once
more
rigid
and
seemingly
lifeless
asbury
took
the
reins
firmly
in
his
hands
seated
himself
and
speaking
gently
to
the
trembling
horses
started
homeward
they
plunged
violently
at
first
but
he
used
the
whip
unsparingly
and
in
a
few
moments
they
trotted
briskly
along
graham
and
her
niece
had
not
yet
reached
home
but
graham
met
the
carriage
at
the
door
with
considerable
agitation
and
alarm
in
his
usually
phlegmatic
countenance
as
cornelia
colorless
face
met
his
view
he
threw
up
his
hands
staggered
back
and
exclaimed
my
god
is
she
dead
i
knew
it
would
end
this
way
some
day
nonsense
graham
she
is
frightened
out
of
her
wits
that
is
all
these
yankee
horses
of
yours
have
been
playing
the
very
deuce
clear
the
way
there
all
of
you
lifting
cornelia
in
his
strong
arms
asbury
carried
her
up
to
her
own
room
and
placed
her
on
a
sofa
having
known
her
from
childhood
and
treated
her
so
often
in
similar
attacks
he
immediately
administered
some
medicine
and
ere
long
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
rigid
aspect
leave
her
face
she
sat
up
and
without
a
word
began
to
take
off
her
kid
gloves
which
fitted
tightly
suddenly
looking
up
at
her
father
who
was
anxiously
regarding
her
she
said
abruptly
there
are
no
more
like
her
she
kept
me
from
making
a
simpleton
of
myself
whom
do
you
mean
my
dear
whom
whom
why
beulah
benton
of
course
where
is
she
come
out
of
that
corner
you
quaint
solemn
statue
she
held
out
her
hand
and
a
warm
glad
smile
broke
over
her
pallid
face
as
beulah
approached
her
you
certainly
created
a
very
decided
sensation
beulah
made
quite
a
passable
medea
with
her
inky
hair
trailing
over
the
back
of
the
seat
and
her
little
hands
grasping
the
reins
with
desperate
energy
by
phoebus
you
turned
that
corner
at
the
bank
like
an
electric
bolt
shake
hands
beulah
after
this
you
will
do
in
any
emergency
the
doctor
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
of
paternal
pride
and
affection
i
feel
very
grateful
to
you
began
graham
but
beulah
cut
short
his
acknowledgments
by
saying
hastily
sir
i
did
nothing
at
all
asbury
is
resolved
to
make
a
heroine
of
me
that
is
all
you
owe
me
nothing
at
this
moment
the
coachman
limped
into
the
room
with
garments
dabbled
with
mud
and
inquired
anxiously
whether
the
young
ladies
were
hurt
no
you
son
of
pluto
not
hurt
at
all
thanks
to
your
careful
driving
answered
the
doctor
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
eying
the
discomfited
coachman
humorously
were
you
hurt
by
your
fall
asked
beulah
considerable
bumped
and
thumped
but
not
much
hurt
thank
you
miss
i
was
awfully
scared
when
i
rose
out
of
that
choking
gutter
and
saw
you
standing
up
and
the
horses
flying
like
ole
satan
himself
was
after
them
i
am
marvelous
glad
nothing
was
hurt
and
now
master
sir
i
want
you
to
go
to
the
mayor
and
have
this
firecracker
business
stopped
a
parcel
of
rascally
boys
set
a
match
to
a
whole
pack
and
flung
right
under
andrew
jackson
feet
of
course
i
could
manage
him
after
that
i
to
gracious
a
sin
and
a
shame
the
way
the
boys
in
this
town
do
carry
on
christmas
times
and
indeed
every
other
time
wilson
hobbled
out
grumbling
audibly
beulah
you
must
come
and
spend
christmas
at
my
house
the
girls
and
my
wife
were
talking
about
it
and
concluded
to
send
the
carriage
for
you
early
in
the
morning
the
doctor
drew
on
his
gloves
as
he
spoke
they
may
spare
themselves
the
trouble
sir
she
spends
it
with
me
answered
cornelia
with
you
after
such
a
frolic
as
you
two
indulged
in
this
evening
you
ought
not
to
be
trusted
together
if
i
had
not
been
so
anxious
about
you
i
could
have
laughed
heartily
at
the
doleful
countenances
of
those
two
young
gents
as
they
picked
themselves
up
out
of
the
mud
such
rueful
plight
as
their
gloves
were
in
i
will
send
hartwell
to
see
you
cornelia
a
merry
christmas
to
you
all
in
spite
of
your
mazeppa
episode
his
countenance
vanished
there
comes
antoinette
ejaculating
up
the
steps
father
tell
her
i
do
not
want
to
see
her
or
anybody
else
do
let
her
come
in
here
cried
cornelia
with
a
nervous
start
as
voices
were
heard
in
the
passage
graham
who
felt
a
certain
awe
of
his
willful
child
notwithstanding
his
equable
temper
immediately
withdrew
his
wife
hastened
into
the
room
and
with
trembling
lips
touched
her
daughter
cheek
and
brow
exclaiming
oh
my
child
what
a
narrow
escape
it
is
horrible
to
think
of
horrible
not
at
all
mother
seeing
that
nothing
was
hurt
in
the
least
i
was
sick
any
way
as
i
told
you
do
you
see
beulah
sitting
there
graham
welcomed
her
guest
cordially
you
have
a
great
deal
of
presence
of
mind
i
believe
miss
beulah
you
are
fortunate
i
thanked
my
stars
that
antoinette
was
not
in
the
carriage
for
most
certainly
she
would
have
made
matters
worse
by
screaming
like
an
idiot
and
jumping
out
beulah
taught
me
common
sense
answered
cornelia
unclasping
a
bracelet
and
tossing
a
handful
of
jewelry
across
the
room
to
her
dressing
table
you
underrate
yourself
my
dear
said
her
mother
a
little
proudly
not
at
all
humility
genuine
or
feigned
is
not
one
of
our
family
traits
mother
will
you
send
up
tea
for
us
we
want
a
quiet
time
at
least
i
do
and
beulah
will
stay
with
me
but
my
love
it
is
selfish
to
exclude
the
balance
of
the
family
why
not
come
down
to
the
sitting
room
where
we
can
all
be
together
pleaded
the
mother
because
i
prefer
staying
just
where
i
am
beulah
put
down
that
window
will
you
mary
must
think
that
i
have
been
converted
into
a
polar
bear
and
mother
have
some
coal
brought
up
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
metempsychosis
of
the
orient
i
certainly
was
a
palm
tree
or
a
rhinoceros
in
the
last
stage
of
my
existence
she
shivered
and
wrapped
a
heavy
shawl
up
to
her
very
chin
may
i
come
in
asked
eugene
at
the
door
no
go
and
sing
duets
with
netta
and
amuse
yourself
downstairs
said
she
shortly
while
a
frown
darkened
her
face
nevertheless
he
came
in
shook
hands
with
beulah
and
leaning
over
the
back
of
cornelia
chair
asked
tenderly
how
is
my
sister
i
heard
on
the
street
that
you
were
injured
oh
i
suppose
the
whole
city
will
be
bemoaning
my
tragic
fate
i
am
not
at
all
hurt
eugene
you
have
had
one
of
those
attacks
though
i
see
from
your
face
has
it
passed
off
entirely
no
and
i
want
to
be
quiet
beulah
is
going
to
read
me
to
sleep
after
a
while
you
may
go
down
now
beulah
you
will
be
with
us
i
suppose
yes
i
am
sorry
i
am
obliged
to
dine
out
i
shall
be
at
home
however
most
of
the
day
i
called
the
other
evening
but
you
were
not
at
home
yes
i
was
sorry
i
did
not
see
you
said
beulah
looking
steadily
at
his
flushed
face
and
sparkling
eyes
dine
out
eugene
for
what
i
should
like
to
know
cried
cornelia
raising
herself
in
her
chair
and
fixing
her
eyes
impatiently
upon
him
henderson
and
milbank
are
both
here
you
know
and
i
could
not
refuse
to
join
them
in
a
christmas
dinner
then
why
did
you
not
invite
them
to
dine
at
your
own
house
her
voice
was
angry
her
glance
searching
the
party
was
made
up
before
i
knew
anything
about
it
they
will
all
be
here
in
the
evening
i
doubt
it
said
she
sneeringly
the
flush
deepened
on
his
cheek
and
he
bit
his
lip
then
turning
suddenly
to
beulah
he
said
as
he
suffered
his
eyes
to
wander
over
her
plain
merino
dress
you
have
not
yet
heard
netta
sing
i
believe
no
where
is
she
cornelia
i
have
no
idea
i
hope
my
sister
will
be
well
enough
to
take
part
in
the
tableaux
evening
taking
her
beautifully
molded
hand
he
looked
at
her
anxiously
her
piercing
black
eyes
were
riveted
on
his
countenance
as
she
answered
i
do
know
eugene
i
have
long
since
abandoned
the
hope
of
ever
being
well
again
perhaps
i
may
be
able
to
get
down
to
the
parlors
there
is
antoinette
in
the
passage
she
motioned
him
away
he
kissed
her
tenderly
shook
hands
a
second
time
with
beulah
and
left
the
room
cornelia
bowed
her
head
on
her
palms
and
though
her
features
were
concealed
beulah
thought
she
moaned
as
if
in
pain
cornelia
are
you
ill
again
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
feeble
woman
lifted
her
haggard
face
and
answered
what
can
you
do
that
remains
to
be
seen
something
must
be
done
beulah
i
may
die
at
any
hour
and
you
must
save
him
what
do
you
mean
beulah
heart
throbbed
painfully
as
she
asked
this
simple
question
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
oh
beulah
beulah
it
bows
my
proud
spirit
into
the
dust
again
she
averted
her
head
there
was
a
short
silence
beulah
leaned
her
face
on
her
hand
and
then
cornelia
continued
did
you
detect
it
when
he
first
came
home
yes
oh
it
is
like
a
hideous
nightmare
i
can
not
realize
that
eugene
so
noble
so
pure
so
refined
could
ever
have
gone
to
the
excesses
he
has
been
guilty
of
he
left
home
all
that
he
should
be
but
five
years
abroad
have
strangely
changed
him
my
parents
will
not
see
it
my
mother
says
young
men
are
wild
at
first
and
my
father
shuts
his
eyes
to
his
altered
habits
eugene
constantly
drinks
too
much
i
have
never
seen
him
intoxicated
i
do
know
that
he
has
been
since
he
joined
us
in
italy
but
i
dread
continually
lest
his
miserable
associates
lead
him
further
astray
i
had
hoped
that
in
leaving
his
companions
at
the
university
he
had
left
temptation
too
but
the
associates
he
has
found
here
are
even
worse
i
hope
i
shall
be
quiet
in
my
grave
before
i
see
him
drunk
it
would
kill
me
i
verily
believe
to
know
that
he
had
so
utterly
degraded
himself
she
shaded
her
face
with
her
hands
and
beulah
replied
hastily
he
surely
can
not
fall
so
low
eugene
will
never
reel
home
an
unconscious
drunkard
oh
no
it
is
impossible
impossible
the
stars
in
heaven
will
fall
first
do
you
believe
what
you
say
i
hope
it
and
hope
engenders
faith
answered
beulah
a
bitter
smile
curled
cornelia
lips
and
sinking
back
in
her
chair
she
continued
where
excessive
drinking
is
not
considered
a
disgrace
young
men
indulge
without
a
thought
of
the
consequences
instead
of
excluding
them
from
genteel
circles
their
dissipation
is
smoothed
over
or
unnoticed
and
it
has
become
so
prevalent
in
this
city
that
of
all
the
gentlemen
whom
i
meet
in
fashionable
society
there
are
very
few
who
abstain
from
the
i
have
seen
them
at
parties
staggering
through
a
quadrille
or
talking
the
most
disgusting
nonsense
to
girls
who
have
long
since
ceased
to
regard
dissipation
as
a
stigma
upon
the
names
and
characters
of
their
friends
i
tell
you
the
dissipation
of
the
young
men
here
is
sickening
to
think
of
since
i
came
home
i
have
been
constantly
reminded
of
it
and
oh
eugene
is
following
in
their
disgraceful
steps
beulah
if
the
wives
and
mothers
and
sisters
did
their
duty
all
this
might
be
remedied
if
they
carefully
and
constantly
strove
to
shield
their
sons
and
brothers
from
temptation
they
might
preserve
them
from
the
fatal
habit
which
once
confirmed
it
is
almost
impossible
to
eradicate
but
alas
they
smile
as
sweetly
upon
the
reckless
intoxicated
beaux
as
if
they
were
what
men
should
be
i
fancied
that
i
could
readily
redeem
eugene
from
his
dangerous
lapses
but
my
efforts
are
rendered
useless
by
the
temptations
which
assail
him
from
every
quarter
he
shuns
me
hourly
the
barriers
between
us
strengthen
beulah
i
look
to
you
he
loves
you
and
your
influence
might
prevail
if
properly
directed
you
must
save
him
you
must
i
have
not
the
influence
you
ascribe
to
me
answered
beulah
do
not
say
so
do
not
say
so
are
you
not
to
be
his
wife
one
day
she
stood
up
and
heavy
drops
glistened
on
her
pale
forehead
his
wife
cornelia
graham
are
you
mad
cried
beulah
lifting
her
head
proudly
and
eying
her
companion
with
unfeigned
astonishment
while
her
eyes
burned
ominously
he
told
me
that
he
expected
to
marry
you
that
it
had
always
been
a
settled
thing
beulah
you
have
not
broken
the
engagement
surely
you
have
not
she
grasped
beulah
arm
convulsively
no
positive
engagement
ever
existed
while
we
were
children
we
often
spoke
of
our
future
as
one
but
of
late
neither
of
us
has
alluded
to
the
subject
we
are
only
friends
linked
by
memories
of
early
years
nay
since
his
return
we
have
almost
become
strangers
then
i
have
been
miserably
deceived
not
two
months
since
he
told
me
that
he
looked
upon
you
as
his
future
wife
what
has
alienated
you
beulah
benton
do
you
not
love
him
love
him
no
you
loved
him
once
hush
do
deny
it
i
know
that
you
did
you
loved
him
during
his
absence
and
you
must
love
him
still
beulah
you
do
love
him
i
have
a
true
sisterly
affection
for
him
but
as
for
the
love
which
you
allude
to
i
tell
you
cornelia
i
have
not
one
particle
then
he
is
lost
sinking
back
in
her
chair
cornelia
groaned
aloud
why
eugene
should
have
made
such
an
impression
on
your
mind
i
can
not
conjecture
he
has
grown
perfectly
indifferent
to
me
and
even
if
he
had
not
we
could
never
be
more
than
friends
boyish
fancies
have
all
passed
away
he
is
a
man
now
still
my
friend
i
believe
but
no
longer
what
he
once
was
to
me
cornelia
i
too
see
his
growing
tendency
to
dissipation
with
a
degree
of
painful
apprehension
which
i
do
not
hesitate
to
avow
though
cordial
enough
when
we
meet
i
know
and
feel
that
he
carefully
avoids
me
consequently
i
have
no
opportunity
to
exert
what
little
influence
i
may
possess
i
looked
at
his
flushed
face
just
now
and
my
thoughts
flew
back
to
the
golden
days
of
his
boyhood
when
he
was
all
that
a
noble
pure
generous
nature
could
make
him
i
would
ten
thousand
times
rather
know
that
he
was
sleeping
by
my
little
sister
side
in
the
graveyard
than
see
him
disgrace
himself
her
voice
faltered
and
she
drooped
her
head
to
conceal
the
anguish
which
convulsed
her
features
beulah
if
he
loves
you
still
you
will
not
reject
him
cried
cornelia
eagerly
he
does
not
love
me
why
will
you
evade
me
suppose
that
he
does
then
i
tell
you
solemnly
not
all
christendom
could
induce
me
to
marry
him
but
to
save
him
beulah
to
save
him
replied
cornelia
clasping
her
hands
entreatingly
if
a
man
innate
will
not
save
him
from
habitual
disgusting
intoxication
all
the
female
influence
in
the
universe
would
not
avail
man
will
like
woman
is
stronger
than
his
affection
and
once
subjugated
by
vice
all
external
influences
will
be
futile
if
eugene
once
sinks
so
low
neither
you
nor
i
nor
his
wife
had
he
one
could
reclaim
him
he
has
deceived
me
fool
that
i
was
not
to
probe
the
mask
cornelia
started
up
and
paced
the
floor
with
uncontrollable
agitation
take
care
how
you
accuse
him
rashly
i
am
not
prepared
to
believe
that
he
could
act
dishonorably
toward
anyone
i
will
not
believe
it
oh
you
too
will
get
your
eyes
open
in
due
time
ha
it
is
all
as
clear
as
daylight
and
i
with
my
boasted
penetration
it
maddens
me
her
eyes
glittered
like
polished
steel
explain
yourself
eugene
is
above
suspicion
cried
beulah
with
pale
fluttering
lips
explain
myself
then
understand
that
my
honorable
brother
professed
to
love
you
and
pretended
that
he
expected
to
marry
you
simply
and
solely
to
blind
me
in
order
to
conceal
the
truth
i
taxed
him
with
a
preference
for
antoinette
dupres
which
i
fancied
his
manner
evinced
he
denied
it
most
earnestly
protesting
that
he
felt
bound
to
you
now
do
you
understand
her
lips
were
white
and
writhed
with
scorn
still
you
may
misjudge
him
returned
beulah
haughtily
no
no
my
mother
has
seen
it
all
along
but
fool
that
i
was
i
believed
his
words
now
beulah
if
he
marries
antoinette
you
will
be
amply
revenged
or
my
name
is
not
cornelia
graham
she
laughed
bitterly
and
dropping
some
medicine
from
a
vial
swallowed
the
potion
and
resumed
her
walk
up
and
down
the
floor
revenged
what
is
it
to
me
that
he
should
marry
your
cousin
if
he
loves
her
it
is
no
business
of
mine
and
certainly
you
have
no
right
to
object
you
are
miserably
deceived
if
you
imagine
that
his
marriage
would
cause
me
an
instant
regret
think
you
i
could
love
a
man
whom
i
knew
to
be
my
inferior
indeed
you
know
little
of
my
nature
she
spoke
with
curling
lips
and
a
proud
smile
you
place
an
exalted
estimate
upon
yourself
returned
cornelia
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
then
the
heiress
bowed
her
head
and
said
in
low
broken
tones
oh
beulah
beulah
child
of
poverty
would
i
could
change
places
with
you
you
are
weak
cornelia
answered
beulah
gravely
in
some
respects
perhaps
i
am
but
you
are
bold
to
tell
me
so
genuine
friendship
ignores
all
hesitancy
in
speaking
the
truth
you
sought
me
i
am
very
candid
perhaps
blunt
if
my
honesty
does
not
suit
you
it
is
an
easy
matter
to
discontinue
our
intercourse
the
whole
matter
rests
with
you
you
wish
me
to
understand
that
you
do
not
need
my
society
my
patronage
patronage
implies
dependence
which
in
this
instance
does
not
exist
an
earnest
woman
can
not
be
patronized
in
the
sense
in
which
you
employ
the
term
she
could
not
forbear
smiling
the
thought
of
being
under
patronage
was
to
her
supremely
ridiculous
you
do
not
want
my
friendship
then
i
doubt
whether
you
have
any
to
bestow
you
seem
to
have
no
love
for
anything
replied
beulah
coldly
oh
you
wrong
me
cried
cornelia
passionately
if
i
do
it
is
your
own
fault
i
only
judge
you
from
what
you
have
shown
of
your
nature
remember
i
have
been
an
invalid
all
my
life
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
it
in
your
presence
but
cornelia
your
whole
being
seems
embittered
yes
and
you
will
be
just
like
me
when
you
have
lived
as
long
as
i
have
wait
till
you
have
seen
something
of
the
world
sit
down
cornelia
you
tremble
from
head
to
foot
she
drew
a
chair
close
to
the
hearth
and
the
sufferer
sank
into
it
as
if
completely
exhausted
for
some
time
neither
spoke
beulah
stood
with
her
hands
on
the
back
of
the
chair
wishing
herself
back
in
her
quiet
little
room
after
a
while
cornelia
said
slowly
if
you
only
knew
antoinette
as
well
as
i
do
you
could
ill
brook
the
thought
of
her
ever
being
eugene
wife
he
is
the
best
judge
of
what
will
promote
his
happiness
no
he
is
blinded
infatuated
her
pretty
face
veils
her
miserable
contemptible
defects
of
character
she
is
utterly
unworthy
of
him
if
she
loves
him
sincerely
she
will
do
talk
of
what
you
do
not
understand
she
is
too
selfish
to
love
anything
or
anybody
but
herself
mark
me
whether
i
live
to
see
it
or
not
if
he
marries
her
he
will
despise
her
in
less
than
six
months
and
curse
himself
for
his
blind
folly
oh
what
a
precious
farce
it
will
prove
she
laughed
sneeringly
cornelia
you
are
not
able
to
bear
this
excitement
for
the
present
let
eugene
and
his
future
rest
and
try
to
compose
yourself
you
are
so
nervous
you
can
scarcely
sit
still
the
colorless
face
with
its
gleaming
eyes
was
suddenly
lifted
and
throwing
her
arms
round
beulah
neck
cornelia
rested
her
proud
head
on
the
orphan
shoulder
be
my
friend
while
i
live
oh
give
me
some
of
your
calm
contentment
some
of
your
strength
i
am
your
friend
cornelia
i
will
always
be
such
but
every
soul
must
be
sufficient
for
itself
do
not
look
to
me
lean
upon
your
own
nature
it
will
suffice
for
all
its
needs
with
the
young
teacher
pity
was
almost
synonymous
with
contempt
and
as
she
looked
at
the
joyless
face
of
her
companion
she
could
not
avoid
thinking
her
miserably
weak
chapter

christmas
day
was
sunny
and
beautiful
the
bending
sky
was
as
deeply
blue
as
that
which
hung
over
bethlehem
eighteen
hundred
years
before
god
coloring
had
not
faded
happy
children
prattled
as
joyously
as
did
the
little
jew
boys
who
clustered
curiously
about
the
manger
to
gaze
upon
the
holy
babe
the
sleeping
jesus
human
nature
had
not
altered
one
whit
beneath
the
iron
wheel
of
time
is
there
a
man
so
sunk
in
infamy
or
steeped
in
misanthropy
that
he
has
not
at
some
period
of
his
life
exclaimed
in
view
of
fadeless
beauty
world
is
very
lovely
o
my
god
i
thank
thee
that
i
live
alas
for
the
besotted
soul
who
can
not
bend
the
knee
of
humble
adoration
before
nature
altar
where
sacrifices
are
offered
to
the
jehovah
pavilioned
in
invisibility
there
is
an
ardent
love
of
nature
as
far
removed
from
gross
materialism
or
subtle
pantheism
on
the
one
hand
as
from
stupid
inappreciation
on
the
other
there
is
such
a
thing
as
looking
through
nature
up
to
nature
god
notwithstanding
the
frightened
denials
of
those
who
shocked
at
the
growing
materialism
of
the
age
would
fain
persuade
this
generation
to
walk
blindfold
through
the
superb
temple
a
loving
god
has
placed
us
in
while
every
sane
and
earnest
mind
must
turn
disgusted
and
humiliated
from
the
senseless
rant
which
resolves
all
divinity
into
materialistic
elements
it
may
safely
be
proclaimed
that
genuine
aesthetics
is
a
mighty
channel
through
which
the
love
and
adoration
of
almighty
god
enters
the
human
soul
it
were
an
insult
to
the
creator
to
reject
the
influence
which
even
the
physical
world
exerts
on
contemplative
natures
from
bald
hoary
mountains
and
somber
solemn
forests
from
thundering
waves
and
wayside
violets
from
gorgeous
sunset
clouds
from
quiet
stars
and
whispering
winds
come
unmistakable
voices
hymning
of
the
eternal
god
the
god
of
moses
of
isaac
and
of
jacob
extremes
meet
in
every
age
and
in
every
department
because
one
false
philosophy
would
deify
the
universe
startled
opponents
tell
us
to
close
our
ears
to
these
musical
utterances
and
shut
our
eyes
to
glorious
nature
god
handiwork
oh
why
has
humanity
so
fierce
a
hatred
of
medium
paths
ragged
boys
and
barefooted
girls
tripped
gayly
along
the
streets
merry
and
uncomplaining
and
surrounded
by
velvet
silver
and
marble
by
every
superfluity
of
luxury
cornelia
graham
with
a
bitter
heart
and
hopeless
soul
shivered
in
her
before
a
glowing
fire
the
christmas
sunlight
crept
in
through
the
heavy
crimson
curtains
and
made
gorgeous
on
the
walls
but
its
cheering
radiance
mocked
the
sickly
pallor
of
the
invalid
and
as
beulah
retreated
to
the
window
and
peeped
into
the
street
she
felt
an
intense
longing
to
get
out
under
the
blue
sky
once
more
and
graham
and
antoinette
sat
round
the
hearth
discussing
the
tableaux
for
the
evening
while
with
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
cornelia
listlessly
fingered
a
diamond
necklace
which
her
father
had
just
given
her
the
blazing
jewels
slipped
through
her
pale
fingers
all
unnoticed
and
she
looked
up
abstractedly
when
graham
touched
her
and
repeated
his
question
for
the
third
time
my
child
wo
you
come
down
to
the
sitting
room
no
sir
i
am
better
here
but
you
will
be
so
lonely
not
with
beulah
but
of
course
miss
benton
will
desire
to
see
the
tableaux
you
would
not
keep
her
from
them
remonstrated
her
father
thank
you
graham
i
prefer
remaining
with
cornelia
answered
beulah
who
had
no
wish
to
mingle
in
the
crowd
which
she
understood
from
the
conversation
would
assemble
that
evening
in
the
parlors
the
trio
round
the
hearth
looked
at
each
other
and
evidently
thought
she
manifested
very
heathenish
taste
cornelia
smiled
and
leaned
back
with
an
expression
of
pleasure
which
very
rarely
lighted
her
face
you
are
shockingly
selfish
and
exacting
said
antoinette
curling
her
long
ringlets
over
her
pretty
fingers
and
looking
very
bewitching
her
cousin
eyed
her
in
silence
and
not
particularly
relishing
her
daughter
keen
look
graham
rose
kissed
her
forehead
and
said
gently
my
love
the
vincents
and
thorntons
and
hendersons
all
sent
to
inquire
after
you
this
morning
netta
and
i
must
go
down
now
and
prepare
for
our
tableaux
i
leave
you
in
good
hands
miss
benton
is
considered
an
admirable
nurse
i
believe
mother
where
is
eugene
i
really
do
not
know
do
you
mr
graham
he
has
gone
to
the
hotel
to
see
some
of
his
old
heidelberg
friends
answered
netta
examining
beulah
plain
merino
dress
very
minutely
as
she
spoke
when
he
comes
home
be
good
enough
to
tell
him
that
i
wish
to
see
him
very
well
my
dear
graham
left
the
room
followed
by
her
husband
and
niece
for
some
time
cornelia
sat
just
as
they
left
her
the
diamond
necklace
slipped
down
and
lay
a
glittering
heap
on
the
carpet
and
the
delicate
waxen
hands
drooped
listlessly
over
the
arms
of
the
chair
her
profile
was
toward
beulah
who
stood
looking
at
the
regular
beautiful
features
and
wondering
how
with
so
many
elements
of
happiness
in
her
home
she
could
seem
so
discontented
she
was
thinking
too
that
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
truth
in
that
persecuted
and
ignored
dictum
a
man
only
sees
that
which
he
brings
with
him
the
power
of
seeing
when
cornelia
raised
herself
and
turning
her
head
to
look
for
her
companion
said
slowly
where
are
you
do
you
believe
in
the
emersonian
of
compensation
rigid
and
inevitable
as
fate
i
say
beulah
do
you
believe
it
yes
i
believe
it
hand
me
the
volume
there
on
the
table
his
exposition
of
absolute
balance
of
give
and
take
the
doctrine
that
everything
has
its
price
is
the
grandest
triumph
of
his
genius
for
an
hour
this
sentence
has
been
ringing
in
my
ears
the
nature
of
the
soul
is
the
compensation
for
the
inequalities
of
condition
we
are
samples
of
the
truth
of
this
ah
beulah
i
have
paid
a
heavy
heavy
price
you
are
destitute
of
one
it
is
true
but
exempt
from
the
other
yet
mark
you
this
law
of
pertains
solely
to
earth
and
its
denizens
the
very
existence
and
operation
of
the
law
precludes
the
necessity
and
i
may
say
the
possibility
of
that
future
state
designed
as
theologians
argue
for
rewards
and
punishments
she
watched
her
visitor
very
closely
of
course
it
nullifies
the
belief
in
future
adjustments
for
he
says
emphatically
is
not
postponed
a
perfect
equity
adjusts
its
balance
in
all
parts
of
life
will
you
have
pay
for
it
and
take
it
nothing
venture
nothing
have
there
is
no
obscurity
whatever
in
that
remarkable
essay
on
compensation
beulah
took
up
one
of
the
volumes
and
turned
the
pages
carelessly
but
all
this
would
shock
a
christian
and
deservedly
for
emerson
works
collectively
and
individually
are
aimed
at
the
doctrines
of
christianity
there
is
a
grim
terrible
fatalism
scowling
on
his
pages
which
might
well
frighten
the
reader
who
clasped
the
bible
to
his
heart
yet
you
accept
his
are
you
prepared
to
receive
his
deistic
system
cornelia
leaned
forward
and
spoke
eagerly
beulah
smiled
why
strive
to
cloak
the
truth
i
should
not
term
his
fragmentary
system
he
knows
not
yet
what
he
believes
there
are
singular
antagonisms
existing
among
even
his
pet
theories
i
have
not
found
any
replied
cornelia
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
then
you
have
not
studied
his
works
as
closely
as
i
have
done
in
one
place
he
tells
you
he
feels
eternity
of
man
the
identity
of
his
thought
that
plato
truth
and
pindar
fire
belong
as
much
to
him
as
to
the
ancient
greeks
and
on
the
opposite
page
if
i
remember
aright
he
says
extravagant
spirits
come
by
us
at
intervals
who
disclose
to
us
new
facts
in
nature
i
see
that
men
of
god
have
from
time
to
time
walked
among
men
and
made
their
commission
felt
in
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
commonest
hearer
hence
evidently
the
tripod
the
priest
the
priestess
inspired
by
the
divine
afflatus
thus
at
one
moment
he
finds
no
in
the
worships
of
moses
of
zoroaster
of
menu
or
socrates
they
are
as
much
his
as
theirs
and
at
another
clearly
asserts
that
spirits
do
come
into
the
world
to
discover
to
us
new
truths
at
some
points
we
are
told
that
the
cycles
of
time
reproduce
all
things
at
others
this
theory
is
denied
again
in
he
says
trust
thyself
insist
on
yourself
obey
thy
heart
and
thou
shalt
reproduce
the
foreworld
again
all
this
was
very
comforting
to
me
cornelia
was
the
great
secret
of
success
and
happiness
but
i
chanced
to
read
the
soon
after
and
lo
these
words
am
constrained
every
moment
to
acknowledge
a
higher
origin
for
events
than
the
will
i
call
mine
this
was
directly
antagonistic
to
the
entire
spirit
of
but
i
read
on
and
soon
found
the
last
sentence
utterly
nullified
by
one
which
declared
positively
the
highest
dwells
with
man
the
sources
of
nature
are
in
his
own
mind
sometimes
we
are
informed
that
our
souls
are
and
an
incarnation
of
the
divine
and
universal
and
before
we
fairly
digest
this
tremendous
statement
he
coolly
asserts
that
there
is
above
all
an
soul
whose
inevitable
decrees
upset
our
plans
and
private
will
cognizant
of
these
palpable
contradictions
emerson
boldly
avows
and
defends
them
by
declaring
that
foolish
consistency
is
the
hobgoblin
of
little
minds
with
consistency
a
great
soul
has
simply
nothing
to
do
speak
what
you
think
now
in
hard
words
and
speak
what
thinks
in
hard
words
again
though
it
contradict
everything
you
said
why
should
you
keep
your
head
over
your
shoulder
why
drag
about
this
corpse
of
your
memory
lest
you
contradict
somewhat
you
have
stated
in
this
or
that
public
place
suppose
you
should
contradict
yourself
his
writings
are
to
me
like
heaps
of
broken
glass
beautiful
in
the
individual
crystal
sparkling
and
often
dazzling
but
gather
them
up
and
try
to
fit
them
into
a
whole
and
the
jagged
edges
refuse
to
unite
certainly
cornelia
you
are
not
an
emersonian
her
deep
quiet
eyes
looked
full
into
those
of
the
invalid
yes
i
am
i
believe
in
that
fatalism
which
he
shrouds
under
the
gauze
of
an
replied
cornelia
impressively
then
you
are
a
fair
sample
of
the
fallacy
of
his
system
if
the
disjointed
bits
of
logic
deserve
the
name
how
so
he
continually
exhorts
to
a
happy
contented
and
uncomplaining
frame
of
mind
tells
you
sternly
that
is
the
want
of
it
is
infirmity
of
will
you
are
disposed
to
be
severe
muttered
cornelia
with
an
angry
flash
what
because
i
expect
his
professed
disciple
to
obey
his
injunctions
do
you
then
conform
so
irreproachably
to
your
own
creed
pray
what
is
it
i
have
no
creed
i
am
honestly
and
anxiously
hunting
one
for
a
long
time
i
thought
that
i
had
found
a
sound
one
in
emerson
but
a
careful
study
of
his
writings
taught
me
that
of
all
pyrrhonists
he
is
the
prince
can
a
creedless
soul
aid
me
in
my
search
verily
no
he
exclaims
fill
the
hour
that
is
happiness
to
fill
the
hour
and
leave
no
crevice
for
repentance
or
an
approval
we
live
amid
surfaces
and
the
true
art
of
life
is
to
skate
well
on
them
now
this
sort
of
oyster
existence
does
not
suit
me
cornelia
graham
nor
will
it
suit
you
you
do
him
injustice
he
has
a
creed
true
it
is
pantheistic
which
he
steadfastly
adheres
to
under
all
circumstances
oh
has
he
indeed
then
he
flatly
contradicts
you
when
he
says
lest
i
should
mislead
any
when
i
have
my
own
head
and
obey
my
whims
let
me
remind
the
reader
that
i
am
only
an
experimenter
do
not
set
the
least
value
on
what
i
do
or
the
least
discredit
on
what
i
do
not
as
if
i
pretended
to
settle
anything
as
true
or
false
i
unsettle
all
things
no
facts
are
to
me
sacred
none
are
profane
i
simply
experiment
an
endless
seeker
with
no
past
at
my
back
to
my
fancy
that
savors
strongly
of
nihilism
as
regards
creeds
there
is
no
such
passage
in
emerson
cried
cornelia
stamping
one
foot
unconsciously
on
her
blazing
necklace
yes
the
passage
is
word
for
word
as
i
quoted
it
and
you
will
find
it
in
i
have
read
several
times
and
do
not
remember
it
at
all
events
it
does
not
sound
like
emerson
for
that
matter
his
own
individual
circle
of
ideas
is
so
much
like
augustine
circle
of
which
the
center
is
everywhere
and
the
circumference
nowhere
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
what
may
or
may
not
be
found
within
it
you
will
ultimately
think
with
me
that
though
an
earnest
and
profound
thinker
your
master
is
no
memnon
waking
only
before
the
sunlight
of
truth
his
utterances
are
dim
and
contradictory
she
replaced
the
book
on
the
table
and
taking
up
a
small
basket
resumed
her
sewing
but
beulah
did
you
not
accept
his
of
compensation
i
believe
its
operations
are
correct
as
regards
mere
social
position
wealth
penury
even
the
endowments
of
genius
but
further
than
this
i
do
not
accept
it
i
want
to
believe
that
my
soul
is
immortal
emerson
of
the
attributes
of
the
soul
does
not
satisfy
me
i
desire
something
more
than
an
immutability
or
continued
existence
hereafter
in
the
form
of
an
abstract
idea
of
truth
justice
love
or
humility
cornelia
looked
at
her
steadily
and
after
a
pause
said
with
indescribable
bitterness
and
despair
if
our
past
and
present
shadows
the
future
i
hope
that
my
last
sleep
may
be
unbroken
and
eternal
beulah
raised
her
head
and
glanced
searchingly
at
her
companion
then
silently
went
on
with
her
work
i
understand
your
honest
face
you
think
i
have
no
cause
to
talk
so
you
see
me
surrounded
by
wealth
petted
indulged
in
every
whim
and
you
fancy
that
i
am
a
very
enviable
woman
but
there
you
entirely
mistake
me
interrupted
beulah
with
a
cold
smile
you
think
that
i
ought
to
be
very
happy
and
contented
and
useful
in
the
sphere
in
which
i
move
and
regard
me
i
know
as
a
weak
hypochondriac
beulah
physicians
told
me
long
ago
that
i
lived
upon
the
very
brink
of
the
grave
that
i
might
die
at
any
moment
without
warning
my
grandmother
and
one
of
my
uncles
died
suddenly
with
this
disease
of
the
heart
and
the
shadow
of
death
seems
continually
around
me
it
will
not
be
dispelled
it
haunts
me
forever
not
thyself
of
said
the
preacher
but
i
can
not
even
boast
of
or
this
hour
the
world
knows
nothing
of
this
it
has
been
carefully
concealed
by
my
parents
but
i
know
it
and
beulah
i
feel
as
did
that
miserable
doomed
prisoner
of
poe
and
pendulum
who
saw
the
pendulum
slowly
but
surely
sweeping
down
upon
him
my
life
has
been
a
great
unfulfilled
promise
with
what
are
generally
considered
elements
of
happiness
in
my
home
i
have
always
been
solitary
and
unsatisfied
conscious
of
my
feeble
tenure
on
life
i
early
set
out
to
anchor
myself
in
a
calm
faith
which
would
secure
me
a
happy
lot
in
eternity
my
nature
was
strongly
religious
and
i
longed
to
find
hope
and
consolation
in
some
of
our
churches
my
parents
always
had
a
pew
in
the
fashionable
church
in
this
city
you
need
not
smile
i
speak
advisedly
when
i
say
church
for
assuredly
fashion
has
crept
into
religion
also
nowadays
from
my
childhood
i
was
regularly
dressed
and
taken
to
church
but
i
soon
began
to
question
the
sincerity
of
the
pastor
and
the
consistency
of
the
members
sunday
after
sunday
i
saw
them
in
their
pews
and
week
after
week
listened
to
their
gossiping
slanderous
prominent
members
busied
themselves
about
charitable
associations
and
headed
subscription
lists
and
all
the
while
set
examples
of
frivolity
heartlessness
and
what
is
softly
termed
excesses
which
shocked
my
ideas
of
christian
propriety
and
disgusted
me
with
the
mockery
their
lives
presented
i
watched
the
minister
in
his
social
relations
and
instead
of
reverencing
him
as
a
meek
and
holy
man
of
god
i
could
not
forbear
looking
with
utter
contempt
upon
his
pompous
sufficient
demeanor
toward
the
mass
of
his
flock
while
to
the
most
opulent
and
influential
members
he
bowed
down
with
a
servile
fawning
sycophancy
absolutely
disgusting
i
attended
various
churches
listening
to
sermons
and
watching
the
conduct
of
the
prominent
professing
christians
of
each
many
gave
most
liberally
to
religious
causes
and
institutions
and
made
amends
by
heavily
draining
the
purses
of
widows
and
orphans
some
affected
an
ascetical
simplicity
of
dress
and
yet
hugged
their
purses
where
their
bibles
should
have
been
it
was
all
mammon
worship
some
grossly
palpable
some
adroitly
cloaked
under
solemn
faces
and
severe
observance
of
the
outward
ceremonials
the
clergy
as
a
class
i
found
strangely
unlike
what
i
had
expected
instead
of
earnest
zeal
for
the
promotion
of
christianity
i
saw
that
the
majority
were
bent
only
on
the
aggrandizement
of
their
particular
denomination
verily
i
thought
in
my
heart
all
this
bickering
the
result
of
their
religion
how
these
churches
do
hate
each
other
according
to
each
salvation
could
only
be
found
in
their
special
tenets
within
the
pale
of
their
peculiar
organization
and
yet
all
professed
to
draw
their
doctrines
from
the
same
book
and
beulah
the
end
of
my
search
was
that
i
scorned
all
creeds
and
churches
and
began
to
find
a
faith
outside
of
a
revelation
which
gave
rise
to
so
much
bigotry
so
much
pharisaism
and
delusion
those
who
call
themselves
ministers
of
the
christian
religion
should
look
well
to
their
commissions
and
beware
how
they
go
out
into
the
world
unless
the
seal
of
jesus
be
indeed
upon
their
brows
they
offer
themselves
as
the
pharos
of
the
people
but
ah
they
sometimes
wreck
immortal
souls
by
their
unpardonable
inconsistencies
for
the
last
two
years
i
have
been
groping
my
way
after
some
system
upon
which
i
could
rest
the
little
time
i
have
to
live
oh
i
am
heartsick
and
despairing
what
already
take
courage
cornelia
there
is
truth
somewhere
answered
beulah
with
kindling
eyes
where
where
ah
that
echo
mocks
you
turn
which
way
you
will
i
sit
like
at
the
of
the
abyss
but
unlike
him
i
am
no
democritus
to
jest
over
my
position
i
am
too
miserable
to
laugh
and
my
grim
emersonian
fatalism
gives
me
precious
little
comfort
though
it
is
about
the
only
thing
that
i
do
firmly
believe
in
she
stooped
to
pick
up
her
necklace
shook
it
in
the
glow
of
the
fire
until
a
shower
of
rainbow
hues
flashed
out
and
holding
it
up
asked
contemptuously
what
do
you
suppose
this
piece
of
extravagance
cost
i
have
no
idea
why
fifteen
hundred
dollars
that
is
all
oh
what
is
the
blaze
of
diamonds
to
a
soul
like
mine
shrouded
in
despairing
darkness
and
hovering
upon
the
very
confines
of
eternity
if
there
be
any
she
threw
the
costly
gift
on
the
table
and
wearily
closed
her
eyes
you
have
become
discouraged
too
soon
cornelia
your
very
anxiety
to
discover
truth
evinces
its
existence
for
nature
always
supplies
the
wants
she
creates
you
will
tell
me
that
this
truth
is
to
be
found
down
in
the
depths
of
my
own
soul
for
no
more
than
logic
has
it
ever
been
discovered
and
labeled
but
how
do
i
know
that
all
truth
is
not
merely
subjective
ages
ago
skepticism
intrenched
itself
in
an
impregnable
fortress
is
no
criterion
of
truth
how
do
i
know
that
my
and
are
absolutely
so
my
reason
is
no
infallible
plummet
to
sound
the
sea
of
phenomena
and
touch
noumena
i
tell
you
beulah
it
is
all
a
hasty
rap
at
the
door
cut
short
this
discussion
and
as
eugene
entered
the
cloud
on
cornelia
brow
instantly
lifted
his
gay
christmas
greeting
and
sunny
handsome
face
diverted
her
mind
and
as
her
hand
rested
on
his
arm
her
countenance
evinced
a
degree
of
intense
love
such
as
beulah
had
supposed
her
incapable
of
feeling
it
is
very
selfish
sister
mine
to
keep
beulah
so
constantly
beside
you
when
we
all
want
to
see
something
of
her
was
i
ever
anything
else
but
selfish
but
i
thought
you
prided
yourself
on
requiring
no
society
so
i
do
as
regards
society
in
general
but
beulah
is
an
exception
you
intend
to
come
down
do
you
not
not
if
i
can
avoid
it
eugene
take
beulah
into
the
parlor
and
ask
antoinette
to
sing
afterward
make
beulah
sing
also
and
be
sure
to
leave
all
the
doors
open
so
that
i
can
hear
mind
you
must
not
detain
her
long
beulah
would
have
demurred
but
at
this
moment
she
saw
hartwell
buggy
approaching
the
house
her
heart
seemed
to
spring
to
her
lips
and
feeling
that
after
their
last
unsatisfactory
interview
she
was
in
no
mood
to
meet
him
she
quickly
descended
the
steps
so
blinded
by
haste
that
she
failed
to
perceive
the
hand
eugene
extended
to
assist
her
the
uttered
a
sharp
peal
as
they
reached
the
hall
and
she
had
just
time
to
escape
into
the
parlor
when
the
doctor
was
ushered
in
what
is
the
matter
asked
eugene
observing
the
nervous
flutter
of
her
lips
ask
miss
dupres
to
sing
will
you
he
looked
at
her
curiously
an
instant
then
turned
away
and
persuaded
the
little
beauty
to
sing
she
took
her
seat
and
ran
her
jeweled
fingers
over
the
pearl
keys
with
an
air
which
very
clearly
denoted
her
opinion
of
her
musical
proficiency
well
sir
what
will
you
have
that
favorite
morceau
from
you
have
never
heard
it
i
suppose
said
she
glancing
over
her
shoulder
at
the
young
teacher
yes
i
have
heard
it
answered
beulah
who
could
with
difficulty
repress
a
smile
antoinette
half
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
she
thought
the
statement
questionable
and
began
the
song
beulah
listened
attentively
she
was
conscious
of
feeling
more
than
ordinary
interest
in
this
performance
and
almost
held
her
breath
as
the
clear
silvery
voice
caroled
through
the
most
intricate
passages
antoinette
had
been
thoroughly
trained
and
certainly
her
voice
was
remarkably
sweet
and
flexible
but
as
she
concluded
the
piece
and
fixed
her
eyes
complacently
on
beulah
the
latter
lifted
her
head
in
proud
consciousness
of
superiority
sing
me
something
else
said
she
antoinette
bit
her
lips
and
answered
ungraciously
no
i
shall
have
to
sing
and
ca
wear
myself
out
now
beulah
i
shall
hear
you
i
have
sought
an
opportunity
ever
since
i
returned
eugene
spoke
rather
carelessly
do
you
really
wish
to
hear
me
eugene
of
course
i
do
said
he
with
some
surprise
and
so
do
i
added
graham
leaning
against
the
piano
and
exchanging
glances
with
antoinette
beulah
looked
up
and
asked
quietly
eugene
shall
i
sing
you
a
ballad
one
of
those
simple
old
tunes
we
used
to
love
so
well
in
days
gone
by
no
no
something
operatic
cried
antoinette
without
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
reply
well
then
miss
dupres
select
something
ca
you
favor
us
with
returned
the
beauty
with
something
very
like
a
sneer
beulah
eyes
gave
a
momentary
flash
but
by
a
powerful
effort
she
curbed
her
anger
and
commenced
the
song
it
was
amusing
to
mark
the
expression
of
utter
astonishment
which
gradually
overspread
antoinette
face
as
the
magnificent
voice
of
her
despised
rival
swelled
in
waves
of
entrancing
melody
through
the
lofty
rooms
eugene
looked
quite
as
much
amazed
beulah
felt
her
triumph
and
heartily
enjoyed
it
there
was
a
sparkle
in
her
eye
and
a
proud
smile
on
her
lip
which
she
did
not
attempt
to
conceal
as
she
rose
from
the
piano
eugene
caught
her
hand
and
said
eagerly
i
never
dreamed
of
your
possessing
such
a
voice
it
is
superb
perfectly
magnificent
why
did
not
you
tell
me
of
it
before
you
heard
it
long
ago
in
the
olden
time
said
she
withdrawing
her
hand
and
looking
steadily
at
him
ah
but
it
has
improved
incredibly
you
were
all
untutored
then
it
is
the
culture
then
not
the
voice
itself
eh
eugene
it
is
both
who
taught
you
i
had
several
teachers
but
owe
what
excellence
i
may
possess
to
my
guardian
he
aided
me
more
than
all
the
instruction
books
that
ever
were
compiled
you
must
come
and
practice
with
the
musical
people
who
meet
here
very
frequently
said
graham
thank
you
madam
i
have
other
engagements
which
will
prevent
my
doing
so
nonsense
beulah
we
have
claims
on
you
i
certainly
have
answered
eugene
have
you
i
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
there
was
a
patronizing
manner
in
all
this
which
she
felt
no
disposition
to
submit
to
most
assuredly
i
have
beulah
and
mean
to
maintain
them
she
perfectly
understand
the
haughty
expression
of
his
countenance
and
moving
toward
the
door
replied
coldly
another
time
eugene
we
will
discuss
them
where
are
you
going
inquired
graham
rather
stiffly
to
cornelia
the
doctor
came
down
a
few
minutes
since
she
did
not
pause
to
hear
what
followed
but
ran
up
the
steps
longing
to
get
out
of
a
house
where
she
plainly
perceived
her
presence
was
by
no
means
desired
cornelia
sat
with
her
head
drooped
on
her
thin
hand
and
without
looking
up
said
more
gently
than
was
her
custom
why
did
you
hurry
back
so
soon
because
the
parlor
was
not
particularly
attractive
there
came
the
first
laugh
which
beulah
had
ever
heard
from
cornelia
lips
as
the
latter
replied
what
friends
you
and
old
growling
diogenes
would
have
been
pray
how
did
my
cousin
receive
your
performance
very
much
as
if
she
wished
me
amid
the
ruins
of
persepolis
where
i
certainly
shall
be
before
i
inflict
anything
more
upon
her
cornelia
do
not
ask
or
expect
me
to
come
here
again
for
i
will
not
of
course
it
is
quite
as
palpable
to
you
as
to
me
that
i
am
no
favorite
with
your
parents
and
something
still
less
with
your
cousin
consequently
you
need
not
expect
to
see
me
here
again
do
not
say
so
beulah
you
must
you
shall
come
and
i
will
see
that
no
one
dares
interfere
with
my
wishes
as
for
antoinette
she
is
simply
a
vain
idiot
you
might
just
as
well
be
told
the
truth
for
doubtless
you
will
see
it
for
yourself
she
is
my
niece
an
only
child
and
possessed
of
considerable
wealth
i
suppose
it
is
rather
natural
that
my
parents
should
fondle
the
idea
of
her
being
eugene
wife
they
do
not
see
how
utterly
unsuited
they
are
eugene
will
of
course
inherit
the
fortune
which
i
once
imagined
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
squandering
my
father
and
mother
dread
lest
eugene
should
return
to
his
fancy
as
you
are
pleased
to
term
it
and
look
on
you
with
jealous
eyes
oh
mammon
is
the
god
of
this
generation
but
beulah
you
must
not
allow
all
this
miserable
maneuvering
to
keep
you
from
me
if
you
do
i
will
very
soon
succeed
in
making
this
home
of
mine
very
unpleasant
for
antoinette
dupres
when
i
am
dead
she
can
wheedle
my
family
as
successfully
as
they
choose
to
permit
but
while
i
do
live
she
shall
forbear
poor
contemptible
human
nature
verily
i
rejoice
sometimes
when
i
remember
that
i
shall
not
be
burdened
with
any
of
it
long
an
angry
spot
burned
on
each
pallid
cheek
and
the
beautiful
mouth
curled
scornfully
do
not
excite
yourself
so
unnecessarily
cornelia
what
you
may
or
may
not
think
of
your
relatives
is
no
concern
of
mine
you
have
a
carriage
always
at
your
command
and
when
you
desire
to
see
a
real
friend
you
can
visit
me
let
this
suffice
for
this
subject
suppose
we
have
a
game
of
chess
or
backgammon
what
do
you
say
she
wheeled
a
light
table
toward
the
hearth
but
the
invalid
motioned
it
away
and
answered
moodily
i
am
in
no
humor
for
games
sit
down
and
tell
me
about
your
leaving
hartwell
protection
i
have
nothing
to
tell
he
is
a
singular
being
receiving
no
answer
she
added
impatiently
do
you
think
so
i
do
in
the
sense
of
great
superiority
the
world
is
not
so
flattering
in
its
estimate
no
for
slander
loves
a
lofty
mark
beulah
benton
do
you
mean
that
for
me
not
unless
you
feel
that
it
applies
to
you
particularly
if
he
is
so
faultless
and
unequaled
pray
why
did
not
you
remain
in
his
house
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
accounting
to
anyone
for
my
motives
or
my
actions
she
lifted
her
slender
form
haughtily
in
which
case
the
public
has
a
habit
of
supplying
both
then
accept
its
fabrications
you
need
not
be
so
fierce
i
like
hartwell
quite
as
well
as
you
do
i
dare
say
but
probably
i
know
more
of
his
history
it
is
all
immaterial
to
me
drop
the
subject
if
you
please
and
let
me
read
to
you
i
believe
i
came
here
for
quiet
companionship
not
recrimination
and
beulah
the
world
says
you
are
to
marry
your
guardian
i
do
not
ask
from
impertinent
curiosity
but
sincere
friendship
is
it
true
about
as
true
as
your
notion
of
my
marriage
with
eugene
no
scarcely
so
plausible
our
families
were
connected
you
know
no
i
neither
know
nor
wish
to
know
he
never
alluded
to
his
wife
or
his
history
and
i
have
just
now
no
desire
to
hear
anything
about
the
matter
he
is
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
i
want
to
honor
and
reverence
him
always
and
of
course
the
world
version
of
his
domestic
affairs
does
him
injustice
so
be
good
enough
to
say
no
more
about
him
very
well
on
hearing
your
voice
from
the
parlor
he
left
a
small
parcel
which
he
requested
me
to
give
you
he
laid
it
on
the
table
i
believe
yes
there
it
is
now
read
to
me
if
you
please
cornelia
crossed
the
room
threw
herself
on
a
couch
and
settled
her
pillow
comfortably
beulah
took
the
parcel
which
was
carefully
sealed
and
wondered
what
it
contained
it
was
heavy
and
felt
hard
they
had
parted
in
anger
what
could
it
possibly
be
black
eyes
were
on
her
countenance
she
put
the
package
in
her
pocket
seated
herself
by
the
couch
and
commenced
egmont
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
indescribable
relief
that
the
orphan
awoke
at
dawn
the
following
morning
and
dressed
by
the
gray
twilight
she
had
fallen
asleep
the
night
before
amid
the
hum
of
voices
of
laughter
and
of
dancing
feet
sounds
of
gayety
from
the
merry
party
below
had
found
their
way
to
the
chamber
of
the
heiress
and
when
beulah
left
her
at
midnight
she
was
still
wakeful
and
restless
the
young
teacher
could
not
wait
for
the
late
breakfast
of
the
luxurious
grahams
and
just
as
the
first
level
ray
of
sunshine
flashed
up
from
the
east
she
tied
on
her
bonnet
and
noiselessly
entered
cornelia
room
the
heavy
curtains
kept
it
close
and
dark
and
on
the
hearth
a
taper
burned
with
pale
sickly
light
cornelia
slept
soundly
but
her
breathing
was
heavy
and
irregular
and
the
face
wore
a
scowl
as
if
some
severe
pain
had
distorted
it
the
arms
were
thrown
up
over
the
head
and
large
drops
glistened
on
the
wan
brow
beulah
stood
beside
the
bed
a
few
minutes
the
apartment
was
furnished
with
almost
oriental
splendor
but
how
all
this
satin
and
rosewood
and
silver
and
marble
mocked
the
restless
suffering
sleeper
beulah
felt
tears
of
compassion
weighing
down
her
lashes
as
she
watched
the
haggard
countenance
of
this
petted
child
of
fortune
but
unwilling
to
rouse
her
she
silently
stole
down
the
steps
the
hall
was
dark
the
smell
of
gas
almost
stifling
of
course
the
servants
followed
the
example
of
their
owners
and
as
no
one
appeared
she
unlocked
the
street
door
and
walked
homeward
with
a
sensation
of
pleasurable
relief
which
impressed
itself
very
legibly
on
her
face
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
early
risen
run
looked
over
the
earth
in
dazzling
radiance
and
the
cold
pure
wintry
air
made
the
blood
tingle
in
beulah
veins
a
great
unspeakable
joy
filled
her
soul
the
uplifted
eyes
beamed
with
gladness
her
brave
hopeful
spirit
looked
into
the
future
with
unquestioning
trust
and
as
the
image
of
her
unhappy
friend
flitted
across
her
mind
she
exclaimed
this
world
is
lull
of
beauty
like
other
worlds
above
and
if
we
did
our
duty
it
might
be
full
of
loe
she
ran
up
to
her
room
threw
open
the
blinds
looped
back
the
curtains
and
drew
that
mysterious
package
from
her
pocket
she
was
very
curious
to
see
the
contents
and
broke
the
seal
with
trembling
fingers
the
outer
wrappings
fell
off
and
disclosed
an
oblong
case
it
opened
with
a
spring
and
revealed
to
her
a
beautiful
watch
and
chain
bearing
her
name
in
delicate
tracery
a
folded
slip
of
paper
lay
on
the
crimson
velvet
lining
of
the
box
and
recognizing
the
characters
she
hastily
read
this
brief
sentence
wear
it
constantly
beulah
to
remind
you
that
in
adversity
you
still
have
a
guardian
tears
gushed
unrestrained
as
she
looked
at
the
beautiful
gift
not
for
an
instant
did
she
dream
of
accepting
it
and
she
shrank
shudderingly
from
widening
the
breach
which
already
existed
by
a
refusal
locking
up
the
slip
of
paper
in
her
workbox
she
returned
the
watch
to
its
case
and
carefully
retied
the
parcel
long
before
she
had
wrapped
the
purse
in
paper
and
prevailed
on
clara
to
give
it
to
the
doctor
he
had
received
it
without
comment
but
she
could
not
return
the
watch
in
the
same
way
for
clara
was
now
able
to
attend
regularly
to
her
school
duties
and
it
was
very
uncertain
when
she
would
see
him
yet
she
felt
comforted
for
this
gift
assured
her
that
however
coldly
he
chose
to
treat
her
when
they
met
he
had
not
thrown
her
off
entirely
with
all
her
independence
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
his
utter
alienation
and
the
consciousness
of
his
remaining
interest
thrilled
her
heart
with
gladness
chapter
xxiii
one
saturday
morning
some
days
subsequent
to
her
visit
to
the
grahams
beulah
set
off
for
the
business
part
of
the
city
she
was
closely
veiled
and
carried
under
her
shawl
a
thick
roll
of
neatly
written
paper
a
publishing
house
was
the
place
of
her
destination
and
as
she
was
ushered
into
a
small
back
room
to
await
the
leisure
of
the
gentleman
she
wished
to
see
she
could
not
forbear
smiling
at
the
novelty
of
her
position
and
the
audacity
of
the
attempt
she
was
about
to
make
there
she
sat
in
the
editor
sanctum
trying
to
quiet
the
tumultuous
beating
of
her
heart
presently
a
tall
spare
man
with
thin
cadaverous
visage
entered
bowed
took
a
chair
and
eyed
her
with
a
sort
of
expression
his
grizzled
hair
was
cut
short
and
stood
up
like
bristles
and
his
keen
blue
eyes
were
by
no
means
promising
in
their
cold
glitter
beulah
threw
off
her
veil
and
said
with
rather
an
unsteady
voice
you
are
the
editor
of
the
magazine
published
here
i
believe
he
bowed
again
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
crossed
his
hands
at
the
back
of
his
head
i
came
to
offer
you
an
article
for
the
magazine
she
threw
down
the
roll
of
paper
on
a
chair
ah
hem
will
you
favor
me
with
your
name
beulah
benton
sir
one
altogether
unknown
to
fame
he
contracted
his
eyes
coughed
and
said
constrainedly
are
you
a
subscriber
i
am
what
is
the
character
of
your
manuscript
he
took
it
up
as
he
spoke
and
glanced
over
the
pages
you
can
determine
that
from
a
perusal
if
the
sketch
suits
you
i
should
like
to
become
a
regular
contributor
a
gleam
of
sunshine
strayed
over
the
countenance
and
the
editor
answered
very
benignly
if
the
article
meets
with
our
approbation
we
shall
be
very
happy
to
afford
you
a
medium
of
publication
in
our
journal
can
we
depend
on
your
punctuality
i
think
so
what
are
your
terms
terms
madam
i
supposed
that
your
contribution
was
gratuitous
said
he
very
loftily
then
you
are
most
egregiously
mistaken
what
do
you
imagine
induces
me
to
write
why
desire
for
fame
i
suppose
fame
is
rather
unsatisfactory
fare
i
am
poor
sir
and
write
to
aid
me
in
maintaining
myself
are
you
dependent
solely
on
your
own
exertions
madam
yes
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
aid
you
but
nowadays
there
are
plenty
of
authors
who
write
merely
as
a
pastime
and
we
have
as
many
contributions
as
we
can
well
look
over
i
am
to
understand
then
that
the
magazine
is
supported
altogether
by
gratuitous
contributions
said
beulah
unable
to
repress
a
smile
why
you
see
authorship
has
become
a
sort
of
luxury
was
the
hesitating
reply
i
think
the
last
number
of
your
magazine
contained
among
other
articles
in
the
drawer
an
earnest
appeal
to
southern
authors
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
southern
periodicals
true
madam
southern
intellect
seems
steeped
in
a
lethargy
from
which
we
are
most
faithfully
endeavoring
to
arouse
it
the
article
to
which
i
allude
also
animadverted
severely
upon
the
practice
of
southern
authors
patronizing
northern
publishing
establishments
most
certainly
it
treated
the
subject
stringently
he
moved
uneasily
i
believe
the
subscription
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
northern
periodicals
a
very
cold
bow
was
the
only
answer
i
happen
to
know
that
northern
magazines
are
not
composed
of
gratuitous
contributions
and
it
is
no
mystery
why
southern
authors
are
driven
to
northern
publishers
southern
periodicals
are
mediums
only
for
those
of
elegant
leisure
who
can
afford
to
write
without
remuneration
with
the
same
subscription
price
you
can
not
pay
for
your
articles
it
is
no
marvel
that
under
such
circumstances
we
have
no
southern
literature
unluckily
i
belong
to
the
numerous
class
who
have
to
look
away
from
home
for
remuneration
sir
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
my
manuscript
rising
she
held
out
her
hand
for
it
but
the
keen
eyes
had
fallen
upon
a
paragraph
which
seemed
to
interest
the
editor
and
knitting
his
brows
he
said
reluctantly
we
have
not
been
in
the
habit
of
paying
for
our
articles
but
i
will
look
over
this
and
perhaps
you
can
make
it
worth
our
while
to
pay
you
the
fact
is
madam
we
have
more
trash
sent
us
than
we
can
find
room
for
but
if
you
can
contribute
anything
of
weight
why
it
will
make
a
difference
of
course
i
did
not
recognize
you
at
first
but
i
now
remember
that
i
heard
your
valedictory
to
the
graduating
class
of
the
public
schools
if
we
should
conclude
to
pay
you
for
regular
contributions
we
wish
nothing
said
about
it
very
well
if
you
like
the
manuscript
and
decide
to
pay
me
you
can
address
me
a
note
through
the
post
office
should
i
write
for
the
magazine
i
particularly
desire
not
to
be
known
she
lowered
her
veil
and
most
politely
he
bowed
her
out
she
was
accustomed
to
spend
a
portion
of
each
saturday
in
practicing
duets
with
georgia
asbury
and
thither
she
now
directed
her
steps
unluckily
the
parlor
was
full
of
visitors
and
without
seeing
any
of
the
family
she
walked
back
into
the
music
room
here
she
felt
perfectly
at
home
and
closing
the
door
forgot
everything
but
her
music
taking
no
heed
of
the
lapse
of
time
she
played
piece
after
piece
until
startled
by
the
clear
tones
of
the
doctor
voice
she
looked
up
and
saw
him
standing
in
the
door
which
opened
into
the
library
taking
off
his
greatcoat
why
beulah
that
room
is
as
cold
as
a
texas
norther
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
there
without
a
fire
come
in
here
child
and
warm
your
frozen
digits
where
are
those
two
specimens
of
mine
i
believe
they
are
still
entertaining
company
sir
the
parlor
was
full
when
i
came
and
they
know
nothing
of
my
being
here
she
sat
down
by
the
bright
fire
and
held
her
stiff
fingers
toward
the
glowing
coals
yes
confound
their
dear
rattlepates
that
is
about
the
of
their
cogitations
he
drew
up
his
chair
put
his
feet
on
the
fender
of
the
grate
and
lighting
his
cigar
added
is
my
spouse
also
in
the
parlor
i
suppose
so
sir
time
was
beulah
when
saturday
was
the
great
day
of
preparation
for
all
housekeepers
bless
my
soul
my
mother
would
just
about
as
soon
have
thought
of
anticipating
the
discovery
of
the
open
polar
sea
by
a
trip
thither
as
going
out
to
visit
on
saturday
why
from
my
boyhood
saturday
has
been
synonymous
with
scouring
window
washing
pastry
baking
stocking
darning
and
numerous
other
venerable
customs
which
this
age
is
rapidly
dispensing
with
my
wife
had
a
lingering
reverence
for
the
duties
of
the
day
and
tried
to
excuse
herself
but
i
suppose
those
pretty
wax
dolls
of
mine
have
coaxed
her
into
as
they
call
it
beulah
my
wife
is
an
exception
but
the
mass
of
married
women
nowadays
instead
of
being
thorough
housewives
as
nature
intended
they
should
are
delicate
fine
ladies
they
have
no
duties
tempora
o
mores
he
paused
to
relight
his
cigar
and
just
then
georgia
came
in
dressed
very
richly
he
tossed
the
taper
into
the
grate
and
exclaimed
as
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
you
pretty
imp
what
is
to
pay
now
here
beulah
has
been
sitting
nobody
knows
how
long
in
that
frigid
zone
you
call
your
music
room
what
are
you
rigged
out
in
all
that
finery
for
we
are
going
to
dine
out
father
beulah
will
excuse
me
i
know
indeed
dine
where
delmont
came
round
this
morning
to
invite
us
to
dine
with
some
of
her
young
friends
from
new
orleans
well
i
sha
go
that
is
all
oh
you
are
not
expected
sir
laughed
georgia
brushing
the
gray
locks
from
his
ample
forehead
not
expected
eh
does
your
lady
mother
contemplate
leaving
me
to
discuss
my
dinner
in
doleful
solitude
no
mother
has
gone
with
rallston
to
see
about
some
poor
starving
family
in
the
suburbs
she
will
be
back
soon
i
dare
say
delmont
has
sent
her
carriage
and
helen
is
waiting
for
me
so
i
must
go
beulah
i
am
very
sorry
we
have
been
cut
out
of
our
practicing
do
go
home
stay
with
mother
and
when
i
come
back
we
will
have
a
glorious
time
ca
you
now
there
a
darling
oh
you
wheedling
hypocritical
madcap
take
yourself
off
of
course
beulah
will
try
to
endure
the
stupid
talk
of
a
poor
old
man
whose
daughters
are
too
fashionable
to
look
after
him
and
whose
wife
is
so
extremely
charitable
that
she
forgets
it
at
home
clear
out
you
trial
of
paternal
patience
he
kissed
her
rosy
lips
and
she
hurried
away
protesting
that
she
would
much
prefer
remaining
at
home
beulah
i
gave
hartwell
that
parcel
you
intrusted
to
me
he
looked
just
as
if
i
had
plunged
him
into
a
but
said
nothing
thank
you
sir
oh
do
thank
me
for
playing
i
do
relish
any
such
work
it
is
very
evident
that
you
two
have
quarreled
i
would
about
as
soon
consult
that
poker
as
ask
hartwell
what
is
to
pay
now
child
what
is
the
matter
nothing
new
sir
he
has
never
forgiven
me
for
turning
teacher
forgiven
bless
me
he
is
as
spiteful
as
a
pequod
begging
your
pardon
asbury
he
is
no
such
thing
cried
beulah
impetuously
just
what
i
might
have
expected
i
am
to
understand
then
that
you
can
abuse
my
partner
sufficiently
without
any
vituperative
assistance
from
me
he
brushed
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
and
looked
at
her
quizzically
sir
it
pains
me
to
hear
him
spoken
of
so
lightly
lightly
upon
my
word
i
thought
indianic
malice
was
rather
a
heavy
charge
however
i
can
succeed
better
if
you
will
allow
do
jest
sir
please
say
no
more
about
him
his
face
became
instantly
grave
and
he
answered
earnestly
beulah
as
a
sincere
friend
i
would
advise
you
not
to
alienate
hartwell
there
are
very
few
such
men
i
do
not
know
his
equal
he
is
interested
in
your
welfare
and
happiness
and
is
the
best
friend
you
ever
had
or
ever
will
have
i
know
it
and
prize
his
friendship
above
all
others
then
why
did
you
return
that
watch
if
he
wished
you
to
wear
it
why
should
you
refuse
mark
me
he
said
nothing
about
it
to
me
but
i
saw
the
watch
with
your
name
engraved
on
the
case
at
the
jewelry
store
where
i
bought
one
just
like
it
for
georgia
i
surmised
it
was
that
same
watch
when
you
intrusted
the
package
to
me
i
was
already
greatly
indebted
to
him
and
did
not
wish
to
increase
the
obligation
my
child
under
the
circumstances
you
were
too
fastidious
he
was
very
much
annoyed
though
as
i
told
you
before
he
made
no
allusion
to
the
subject
yes
i
knew
he
would
be
and
i
am
very
sorry
but
could
not
think
of
accepting
it
oh
you
are
well
matched
upon
my
word
what
do
you
mean
that
you
are
both
as
proud
as
lucifer
and
as
savage
as
heathens
child
i
do
see
what
is
to
become
of
you
every
soul
is
the
star
of
its
own
destiny
answered
beulah
well
very
sorry
destinies
the
majority
make
i
can
tell
you
have
you
seen
lockhart
and
pauline
no
i
was
not
aware
that
they
were
in
the
city
lockhart
health
is
miserable
they
are
all
at
hartwell
for
a
few
weeks
i
believe
pauline
has
grown
up
a
perfect
di
vernon
beauty
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
her
she
is
a
generous
girl
yes
i
rather
think
she
is
hartwell
said
the
other
day
that
pauline
was
anxious
to
see
you
and
since
i
think
of
it
i
believe
he
asked
me
to
tell
you
of
her
arrival
now
i
will
wager
my
head
that
you
intend
to
wait
until
she
calls
formally
which
it
is
your
place
to
do
then
sir
expect
immediate
decapitation
for
i
shall
go
out
to
see
her
this
very
afternoon
replied
beulah
that
is
right
my
dear
child
asbury
if
you
will
not
think
me
troublesome
i
should
like
to
tell
you
of
some
things
that
perplex
me
very
much
said
she
hesitatingly
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
whatever
you
have
to
say
and
if
i
can
possibly
help
you
rest
assured
i
will
what
perplexes
you
a
great
many
things
sir
of
late
i
have
read
several
works
that
have
unsettled
my
former
faith
and
indeed
confused
and
darkened
my
mind
most
miserably
and
i
thought
you
might
aid
me
in
my
search
after
truth
he
threw
his
cigar
into
the
fire
and
while
an
expression
of
sorrow
clouded
his
face
said
very
gravely
beulah
i
am
afraid
i
am
one
of
the
last
persons
to
whom
you
should
apply
for
assistance
do
the
perplexities
to
which
you
allude
involve
religious
questions
yes
sir
almost
entirely
i
am
too
unsettled
myself
to
presume
to
direct
others
beulah
looked
up
in
unfeigned
astonishment
you
certainly
are
not
what
is
termed
skeptical
most
sincerely
do
i
wish
that
i
was
not
there
was
a
short
silence
broken
by
beulah
saying
slowly
and
sorrowfully
you
can
not
aid
me
then
i
am
afraid
not
when
a
young
man
i
was
thoroughly
skeptical
in
my
religious
views
if
i
may
be
said
to
have
had
any
at
the
time
of
my
marriage
i
was
an
infidel
and
such
the
world
still
calls
me
if
i
am
not
now
it
is
because
my
wife
unpretending
consistent
piety
has
taught
me
to
revere
the
precepts
of
a
revelation
which
i
long
ago
rejected
her
pure
religion
makes
me
respect
christianity
which
once
i
sneered
at
i
am
forced
to
acknowledge
the
happy
results
of
her
faith
and
i
may
yet
be
brought
to
yield
up
old
prejudices
and
confess
its
divine
origin
i
am
no
atheist
thank
god
never
have
been
but
i
tell
you
candidly
my
doubts
concerning
the
bible
make
me
an
unsafe
guide
for
a
mind
like
yours
for
some
time
i
have
marked
the
course
of
your
reading
by
the
books
i
missed
from
my
shelves
and
have
feared
just
what
has
happened
on
one
point
my
experience
may
be
of
value
to
you
what
is
comprised
under
the
head
of
philosophical
research
will
never
aid
or
satisfy
you
i
am
an
old
man
beulah
and
have
studied
philosophic
works
for
many
years
but
take
my
word
for
it
the
mass
of
them
are
sheer
humbug
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
philosophers
have
been
investigating
the
countless
mysteries
which
present
themselves
to
every
earnest
mind
but
the
arcana
are
as
inscrutable
now
as
ever
i
do
not
wish
to
discourage
you
beulah
nor
do
i
desire
to
underrate
human
capabilities
but
in
all
candor
this
kind
of
study
does
not
pay
it
has
not
repaid
me
it
has
not
satisfied
hartwell
who
went
deeper
into
metaphysics
than
anyone
i
know
and
who
now
has
less
belief
of
any
sort
than
anyone
i
ever
wish
to
know
i
would
not
advise
you
to
prosecute
this
branch
of
study
i
am
content
to
acknowledge
that
of
many
things
i
know
nothing
and
never
can
be
any
wiser
but
guy
hartwell
is
too
proud
to
admit
his
incapacity
to
grapple
with
some
of
these
mysteries
beulah
my
wife
is
one
of
the
happiest
spirits
i
ever
knew
she
is
a
consistent
christian
when
we
were
married
i
watched
her
very
closely
i
tell
you
child
i
hoped
very
much
that
i
should
find
some
glaring
incongruity
in
her
conduct
which
would
have
sanctioned
my
skepticism
i
was
continually
on
the
lookout
for
defects
of
character
that
might
cast
contempt
on
the
religion
she
professed
i
did
not
expect
her
to
prove
so
unselfish
humble
and
genuinely
pious
as
i
found
her
i
do
most
sincerely
revere
such
religion
as
hers
ah
if
it
were
not
so
rare
i
should
never
have
been
so
skeptical
she
has
taught
me
that
the
precepts
of
the
bible
do
regulate
the
heart
and
purify
the
life
and
to
you
child
i
will
say
candidly
she
has
persuaded
me
to
be
a
christian
whatever
of
he
said
no
more
for
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
asbury
entered
she
welcomed
beulah
with
a
cordial
sincerity
singularly
soothing
to
the
orphan
heart
and
keeping
her
hand
in
a
tight
clasp
asked
several
questions
which
her
husband
cut
short
by
drawing
her
to
his
side
where
have
you
been
straying
to
madam
where
you
must
stray
to
sir
just
as
soon
as
you
start
out
this
evening
on
your
round
of
visits
she
softly
smoothed
back
his
hair
and
kissed
his
forehead
she
was
a
woman
with
a
tranquil
countenance
that
betokened
a
serene
cloudless
soul
and
as
she
stood
beside
her
husband
his
eyes
rested
on
her
face
with
an
expression
bordering
on
adoration
beulah
could
not
avoid
wondering
why
such
women
were
so
very
rare
and
the
thought
presented
itself
with
painful
force
if
cornelia
graham
and
i
had
had
such
mothers
we
might
both
have
been
happier
and
better
probably
something
of
what
crossed
her
mind
crept
into
her
countenance
for
the
doctor
asked
laughingly
in
the
name
of
venus
what
are
you
screwing
up
your
lips
and
looking
so
ugly
about
i
suppose
one
reason
is
that
i
must
go
home
she
rose
with
a
suppressed
sigh
i
am
disposed
to
think
it
much
more
probable
that
you
were
envying
me
my
wife
come
confess
i
was
wishing
that
i
had
such
a
mother
with
some
sudden
impulse
she
threw
her
arms
round
neck
and
hid
her
face
on
her
shoulder
then
let
me
be
your
mother
my
dear
child
said
she
pressing
the
girl
affectionately
to
her
heart
and
kissing
her
pale
cheek
are
you
troubled
about
anything
my
dear
continued
asbury
surprised
at
this
manifestation
of
feeling
in
one
usually
so
cold
and
reserved
an
orphan
heart
mourns
its
dead
idols
answered
beulah
raising
her
hand
and
withdrawing
from
the
kind
arm
that
encircled
her
asbury
interpreted
a
quick
glance
from
her
husband
and
did
not
press
the
matter
further
but
at
parting
she
accompanied
beulah
to
the
front
door
and
earnestly
assured
her
that
if
she
could
in
any
way
advise
or
assist
her
she
would
consider
it
both
a
privilege
and
a
pleasure
to
do
so
returning
to
the
library
she
laid
her
soft
hand
on
her
husband
arm
and
said
anxiously
george
what
is
the
matter
with
her
she
is
distressed
or
rather
perplexed
about
her
religious
doubts
i
inferred
from
what
she
said
just
before
you
came
in
she
has
drifted
out
into
a
troubled
sea
of
philosophy
i
am
inclined
to
think
and
not
satisfied
with
what
she
has
found
is
now
irresolute
as
to
the
proper
course
poor
child
she
is
terribly
in
earnest
about
the
matter
he
sighed
heavily
his
wife
watched
him
eagerly
what
did
you
tell
her
not
to
come
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
perfect
exemplification
of
blind
leading
the
blind
and
when
she
learned
my
own
state
of
uncertainty
she
seemed
to
think
so
herself
an
expression
of
acute
pain
passed
over
her
features
but
banishing
it
as
speedily
as
possible
she
answered
very
gently
take
care
my
husband
lest
by
recapitulating
your
doubts
you
strengthen
hers
alice
i
told
her
the
whole
truth
she
is
not
a
nature
to
be
put
off
with
halfway
statements
hartwell
is
an
avowed
infidel
and
she
knows
it
yet
i
do
not
believe
his
views
have
weighed
with
her
against
received
systems
of
faith
my
dear
alice
this
spirit
of
skepticism
is
scattered
far
and
wide
over
the
land
i
meet
with
it
often
where
i
least
expect
it
it
broods
like
a
hideous
nightmare
over
this
age
and
beulah
must
pass
through
the
same
ordeal
which
is
testing
the
intellectual
portion
of
every
community
but
there
is
that
eternal
let
us
have
dinner
alice
i
must
go
out
early
this
afternoon
he
took
down
a
pair
of
scales
and
began
to
weigh
some
medicine
his
wife
wisely
forbore
to
renew
the
discussion
and
ringing
the
bell
for
dinner
interested
him
with
an
account
of
her
visit
to
a
poor
family
who
required
his
immediate
attention
with
a
heart
unwontedly
heavy
beulah
prepared
to
call
upon
pauline
later
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
it
was
not
companionship
she
needed
for
this
was
supplied
by
books
and
the
sensation
of
loneliness
was
one
with
which
she
had
not
yet
been
made
acquainted
but
she
wanted
a
strong
healthy
cultivated
intellect
to
dash
away
the
mists
that
were
wreathing
about
her
own
mind
already
the
lofty
imposing
structure
of
began
to
rock
to
its
very
foundations
she
was
nearly
ready
for
her
walk
when
hoyt
came
in
miss
beulah
there
is
a
lady
in
the
parlor
waiting
to
see
you
is
it
miss
graham
no
she
is
a
stranger
and
gave
no
name
beulah
descended
to
the
parlor
in
rather
an
ungracious
mood
as
she
entered
a
lady
sprang
to
meet
her
with
both
hands
extended
she
was
superbly
beautiful
with
a
complexion
of
dazzling
whiteness
and
clear
radiant
violet
eyes
over
which
arched
delicately
penciled
brows
the
grecian
mouth
and
chin
were
faultlessly
chiseled
the
whole
face
was
one
of
rare
loveliness
you
do
know
me
for
shame
beulah
to
forget
old
friends
oh
pauline
is
it
you
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
do
say
that
for
politeness
sake
here
i
have
been
for
ten
days
and
you
have
not
stirred
a
foot
to
see
me
i
did
know
you
were
in
town
till
this
morning
and
just
as
you
came
i
was
putting
on
my
bonnet
to
go
and
see
you
are
you
telling
the
truth
yes
positively
i
am
well
i
am
glad
you
felt
disposed
to
see
me
after
my
uncle
you
and
charon
are
all
i
cared
anything
about
meeting
here
bless
your
dear
solemn
gray
eyes
how
often
i
have
wanted
to
see
you
the
impulsive
girl
threw
her
arms
round
beulah
neck
and
kissed
her
repeatedly
be
quiet
and
let
me
look
at
you
oh
pauline
how
beautiful
you
have
grown
cried
beulah
who
could
not
forbear
expressing
the
admiration
she
felt
yes
the
artists
in
florence
raved
considerably
about
ray
beauty
i
ca
tell
you
the
number
of
times
i
sat
for
my
portrait
it
is
very
pleasant
to
be
pretty
i
enjoy
it
amazingly
said
she
with
all
the
candor
which
had
characterized
her
in
childhood
and
with
a
vigorous
squeeze
of
beulah
hand
she
continued
i
was
astonished
when
i
came
and
found
that
you
had
left
uncle
guy
and
were
teaching
little
ragged
dirty
children
their
a
b
c
what
possessed
you
to
do
such
a
silly
thing
duty
my
dear
pauline
oh
for
heaven
sake
do
begin
about
duty
ernest
she
paused
a
rich
glow
swept
over
her
face
and
shaking
back
her
curls
she
added
you
must
quit
all
this
i
say
you
must
i
see
you
are
quite
as
reckless
and
as
ever
answered
beulah
smiling
at
her
authoritative
tone
no
i
positively
am
not
the
fool
uncle
guy
used
to
think
me
i
have
more
sense
than
people
give
me
credit
for
though
i
dare
say
i
shall
find
you
very
skeptical
on
the
subject
beulah
i
know
very
well
why
you
took
it
into
your
wise
head
to
be
a
teacher
you
were
unwilling
to
usurp
what
you
considered
my
place
in
uncle
guy
home
and
heart
you
need
not
straighten
yourself
in
that
ungraceful
way
i
know
perfectly
well
it
is
the
truth
but
i
am
no
poor
suffering
needy
innocent
that
you
should
look
after
i
am
well
provided
for
and
do
intend
to
take
one
cent
of
uncle
guy
money
so
you
might
just
as
well
have
the
benefit
of
it
i
know
too
that
you
and
ma
did
not
exactly
adore
each
other
i
understand
all
about
that
old
skirmishing
but
things
have
changed
very
much
beulah
so
you
must
quit
this
horrid
nonsense
about
working
and
being
independent
how
you
do
rattle
on
about
things
you
do
comprehend
laughed
beulah
come
do
set
me
down
for
a
simpleton
i
tell
you
i
am
in
earnest
you
must
come
back
to
uncle
guy
pauline
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
talk
of
this
matter
i
decided
long
ago
as
to
what
i
ought
to
do
and
certainly
shall
not
change
my
opinion
now
tell
me
what
you
saw
in
europe
why
has
not
eugene
told
you
all
you
wish
to
know
apropos
i
saw
him
at
a
party
last
night
playing
the
devoted
to
that
little
beauty
netta
dupres
we
were
all
in
paris
at
the
same
time
i
fancy
her
she
is
too
insufferably
vain
and
affected
it
is
my
opinion
that
she
is
flirting
with
eugene
which
must
be
quite
agreeable
to
you
oh
i
tell
you
beulah
i
could
easily
put
her
mind
heart
and
soul
in
my
thimble
i
did
not
ask
your
estimate
of
miss
dupres
i
want
to
know
something
of
your
european
tour
i
see
eugene
very
rarely
oh
of
course
we
went
to
see
all
the
sights
and
very
stupid
it
was
lockhart
scolded
continually
about
my
want
of
taste
and
appreciation
because
i
did
not
utter
all
the
interjections
of
delight
and
astonishment
over
old
tumbledown
ruins
and
genuine
of
art
as
he
called
them
upon
my
word
i
have
been
tired
almost
to
death
when
he
and
ma
descanted
by
the
hour
on
the
and
transcendent
and
entrancing
beauties
and
glories
of
old
pictures
that
were
actually
so
black
with
age
that
they
looked
like
daubs
of
tar
and
i
could
not
tell
whether
the
figures
were
men
or
women
archangels
or
cow
drivers
some
things
i
did
enjoy
such
as
the
alps
and
the
mediterranean
and
peter
and
westminster
abbey
and
some
of
the
german
cathedrals
but
as
to
keeping
my
finger
on
the
and
committing
all
the
ecstasy
to
memory
to
spout
out
just
at
the
exact
moment
when
i
saw
nothing
to
deserve
it
why
that
is
all
fudge
i
tell
you
there
is
nothing
in
all
europe
equal
to
our
niagara
i
was
heartily
glad
to
come
home
though
i
enjoyed
some
things
amazingly
how
is
lockhart
health
very
poor
i
am
sorry
to
say
he
looks
so
thin
and
pale
i
often
tell
him
he
would
make
quite
as
good
a
pictured
saint
as
any
we
saw
abroad
how
long
will
you
remain
here
till
uncle
guy
thinks
lockhart
is
well
enough
to
go
to
his
plantation
i
suppose
what
makes
you
so
restless
pauline
why
do
you
sit
still
asked
beulah
observing
that
her
visitor
twisted
about
as
if
uncomfortable
because
i
want
to
tell
you
something
and
really
do
not
know
how
to
begin
said
she
laughing
and
blushing
i
can
not
imagine
what
should
disconcert
you
pauline
thank
you
truly
that
is
a
flattering
tribute
to
my
sensibility
beulah
ca
you
guess
what
i
have
to
tell
you
certainly
not
but
why
should
you
hesitate
to
disclose
it
simply
because
your
tremendous
gray
eyes
have
such
an
owlish
way
of
looking
people
out
of
countenance
now
do
look
quite
through
me
and
i
will
pluck
up
my
courage
and
confess
beulah
i
am
going
to
be
married
soon
she
hid
her
crimsoned
cheeks
behind
her
hands
married
impossible
cried
beulah
but
i
tell
you
i
am
here
is
my
engagement
ring
now
the
most
astonishing
part
of
the
whole
affair
is
that
my
intended
sovereign
is
a
minister
a
preacher
as
solemn
as
job
you
a
minister
wife
pauline
oh
child
you
are
jesting
said
beulah
with
an
incredulous
smile
no
absurd
as
it
may
seem
it
is
nevertheless
true
i
am
to
be
married
in
march
ma
says
i
am
a
fool
lockhart
encourages
and
supports
me
and
uncle
guy
laughs
heartily
every
time
the
affair
is
alluded
to
at
first
before
we
went
to
europe
there
was
violent
opposition
from
my
mother
but
she
found
i
was
in
earnest
and
now
it
is
all
settled
for
march
uncle
guy
knows
ernest
mortimor
and
esteems
him
very
highly
but
thinks
that
i
am
the
last
woman
in
the
united
states
who
ought
to
be
a
minister
wife
i
believe
he
told
ernest
as
much
but
of
course
he
did
not
believe
him
where
does
mortimor
reside
in
georgia
has
charge
of
a
church
there
he
had
a
sister
at
the
same
school
i
attended
in
new
york
and
during
a
visit
to
her
he
says
he
met
his
in
me
he
is
about
five
years
my
senior
but
he
is
here
now
and
you
will
have
an
opportunity
of
forming
your
own
opinion
of
him
how
long
have
you
known
him
about
two
years
i
am
rather
afraid
of
him
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
he
is
so
grave
and
has
such
rigid
notions
that
i
wonder
very
much
what
ever
induced
his
holiness
to
fancy
such
a
heedless
piece
of
womanhood
as
he
is
obliged
to
know
i
am
for
i
never
put
on
any
humility
or
sanctity
what
do
you
think
beulah
uncle
guy
coolly
told
me
this
morning
in
ernest
presence
that
he
was
only
charmed
by
my
pretty
face
and
that
if
i
did
not
learn
some
common
sense
he
would
very
soon
repent
his
choice
oh
the
doleful
warnings
i
have
been
favored
with
but
you
shall
all
see
that
i
am
worthy
of
mortimer
love
her
beautiful
face
was
radiant
with
hope
yet
in
the
violet
eyes
there
lurked
unshed
tears
i
am
very
glad
that
you
are
so
happy
pauline
and
if
you
will
i
am
very
sure
you
can
make
yourself
all
that
mortimor
could
desire
i
am
resolved
i
will
yesterday
he
talked
to
me
very
seriously
about
the
duties
which
he
said
would
devolve
on
me
i
tried
to
laugh
him
out
of
his
sober
mood
but
he
would
talk
about
relations
and
what
would
be
expected
of
a
pastor
wife
until
i
was
ready
to
cry
with
vexation
ernest
is
not
dependent
on
his
salary
his
father
is
considered
wealthy
i
believe
which
fact
reconciles
ma
in
some
degree
he
will
preach
in
church
and
you
must
go
to
hear
him
i
have
never
yet
heard
him
preach
and
am
rather
anxious
to
know
what
sort
of
sermons
i
am
to
listen
to
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
she
looked
at
her
watch
and
rose
i
shall
certainly
go
to
hear
him
answered
beulah
of
course
you
will
and
after
service
you
must
go
home
and
spend
the
day
with
me
ma
begs
that
you
will
not
refuse
to
dine
with
her
and
as
you
are
engaged
all
the
week
uncle
guy
expects
you
also
that
is
he
told
me
to
insist
on
your
coming
but
thought
you
would
probably
decline
will
you
come
do
say
yes
i
do
know
yet
i
will
see
you
at
church
thus
they
parted
chapter
xxiv
on
sabbath
morning
beulah
sat
beside
the
window
with
her
folded
hands
resting
on
her
lap
the
day
was
cloudless
and
serene
the
sky
of
that
intense
melting
blue
which
characterizes
our
clime
from
every
quarter
of
the
city
brazen
muezzins
called
worshipers
to
the
temple
and
bands
of
neatly
clad
happy
children
thronged
the
streets
on
their
way
to
sabbath
school
save
these
and
the
pealing
bells
a
hush
pervaded
all
things
as
though
nature
were
indeed
at
her
prayers
blessed
be
the
hallowed
influences
which
every
sunny
sabbath
morn
exerts
blessed
be
the
holy
tones
which
at
least
once
a
week
call
every
erring
child
back
to
its
infinite
father
for
some
time
beulah
had
absented
herself
from
church
for
she
found
that
instead
of
profiting
by
sermons
she
came
home
to
criticise
and
question
but
early
associations
are
strangely
tenacious
and
as
she
watched
the
children
trooping
to
the
house
of
god
there
rushed
to
her
mind
memories
of
other
years
when
the
orphan
bands
from
the
asylum
regularly
took
their
places
in
the
sabbath
school
the
hymns
she
sang
then
rang
again
in
her
ears
passages
of
scripture
repeated
then
seemed
learned
but
yesterday
how
often
had
the
venerable
superintendent
knelt
and
invoked
special
guidance
for
the
afflicted
band
from
the
god
of
orphans
now
she
felt
doubly
orphaned
in
her
intellectual
pride
she
frequently
asserted
that
she
was
the
star
of
her
own
destiny
but
this
morning
childish
memories
prattled
of
the
star
of
bethlehem
before
which
she
once
bent
the
knee
of
adoration
had
it
set
forever
amid
clouds
of
superstition
sin
and
infidelity
glittering
spires
pointed
to
the
bending
heavens
and
answered
it
burns
on
forever
and
brighter
unto
the
perfect
day
with
a
dull
weight
on
her
heart
she
took
down
her
bible
and
opened
it
indifferently
at
her
mark
it
proved
the
chapter
of
job
and
she
read
on
and
on
until
the
bells
warned
her
it
was
the
hour
of
morning
service
she
walked
to
church
not
humbled
and
prepared
to
receive
the
holy
teachings
of
revelation
but
with
a
defiant
feeling
in
her
heart
which
she
did
not
attempt
or
care
to
analyze
she
was
not
accustomed
to
attend
hew
church
but
the
sexton
conducted
her
to
a
pew
and
as
she
seated
herself
the
solemn
notes
of
the
organ
swelled
through
the
vaulted
aisles
the
choir
sang
a
magnificent
anthem
from
haydn
creation
and
then
only
the
deep
thundering
peal
of
the
organ
fell
on
the
dim
cool
air
beulah
could
bear
no
more
as
she
lowered
her
veil
bitter
tears
gushed
over
her
troubled
face
just
then
she
longed
to
fall
on
her
knees
before
the
altar
and
renew
the
vows
of
her
childhood
but
this
impulse
very
soon
died
away
and
while
the
pews
on
every
side
rapidly
filled
she
watched
impatiently
for
the
appearance
of
the
minister
immediately
in
front
of
her
sat
and
graham
and
antoinette
dupres
beulah
was
pondering
the
absence
of
cornelia
and
eugene
when
a
full
manly
voice
fell
on
her
ear
and
looking
up
she
saw
mortimor
standing
in
the
pulpit
he
looked
older
than
pauline
description
had
prepared
her
to
expect
and
the
first
impression
was
one
of
disappointment
but
the
longer
she
watched
the
grave
quiet
face
the
more
attractive
it
became
certainly
he
was
a
handsome
man
and
judging
from
the
contour
of
head
and
features
an
intellectual
one
there
was
an
absolute
repose
in
the
countenance
which
might
have
passed
with
casual
observers
for
inertia
indifference
but
to
the
practiced
physiognomist
it
expressed
the
perfect
peace
of
a
mind
and
heart
completely
harmonious
the
voice
was
remarkably
clear
and
well
modulated
his
text
was
selected
from
the
first
and
last
chapters
of
ecclesiastes
and
consisted
of
these
verses
for
in
much
wisdom
is
much
grief
and
he
that
increaseth
knowledge
increaseth
sorrow
and
further
by
these
my
son
be
admonished
of
making
many
books
there
is
no
end
and
much
study
is
a
weariness
of
the
flesh
let
us
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
whole
matter
fear
god
and
keep
his
commandments
for
this
is
the
whole
duty
of
man
to
the
discourse
which
followed
beulah
listened
with
the
deepest
interest
she
followed
the
speaker
over
the
desert
of
ancient
oriental
systems
which
he
rapidly
analyzed
and
held
up
as
empty
shells
lifting
the
veil
of
soufism
he
glanced
at
the
mystical
creed
of
algazzali
and
in
an
epitomized
account
of
the
grecian
schools
of
philosophy
depicted
the
wild
vagaries
into
which
many
had
wandered
and
the
unsatisfactory
results
to
which
all
had
attained
not
content
with
these
instances
of
the
insufficiency
and
mocking
nature
of
human
wisdom
and
learning
he
adverted
to
the
destructive
tendency
of
the
helvetian
and
systems
and
after
a
brief
discussion
of
their
ruinous
tenets
dilated
with
some
erudition
upon
the
conflicting
and
dangerous
theories
propounded
by
germany
then
came
the
contemplation
of
christianity
from
it
rise
among
the
fishermen
of
galilee
to
its
present
summit
of
power
for
eighteen
hundred
years
it
had
been
assaulted
by
infidelity
yet
each
century
saw
it
advancing
a
conquering
colossus
throughout
the
sermon
the
idea
was
maintained
that
human
reason
was
utterly
inadequate
to
discover
to
man
his
destiny
that
human
learning
was
a
great
cheat
and
that
only
from
the
pages
of
holy
writ
could
genuine
wisdom
be
acquired
men
were
to
be
as
little
children
in
order
to
be
taught
the
truths
of
immortality
certainly
the
reasoning
was
clear
and
forcible
the
philosophic
allusions
seemed
very
apropos
and
the
language
was
elegant
and
impassioned
the
closing
hymn
was
sung
the
organ
hushed
its
worshiping
tones
the
benediction
was
pronounced
the
congregation
dispersed
as
beulah
descended
the
steps
she
found
pauline
and
lockhart
waiting
at
the
carriage
for
her
the
latter
greeted
her
with
quite
a
show
of
cordiality
but
the
orphan
shrank
back
from
the
offered
kiss
and
merely
touched
the
extended
hand
she
had
not
forgotten
the
taunts
and
unkindness
of
other
days
and
though
not
vindictive
she
could
not
feign
oblivion
of
the
past
nor
assume
a
friendly
manner
foreign
to
her
she
took
her
seat
in
the
carriage
and
found
it
rather
difficult
to
withdraw
her
fascinated
eyes
from
lovely
face
she
knew
what
was
expected
of
her
however
and
said
as
they
drove
rapidly
homeward
mortimor
seems
to
be
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
erudition
did
you
like
his
sermon
do
you
like
him
asked
pauline
eagerly
i
like
him
very
much
indeed
but
do
not
like
his
sermon
at
all
answered
beulah
bluntly
i
am
sure
everybody
seemed
to
be
delighted
with
it
said
lockhart
doubtless
the
majority
of
his
congregation
were
and
i
was
very
much
interested
though
i
do
not
accept
his
views
his
delivery
is
remarkably
impressive
and
his
voice
is
better
adapted
to
the
pulpit
than
any
i
have
ever
listened
to
she
strove
to
say
everything
favorable
which
in
candor
she
could
still
you
did
not
like
his
sermon
said
pauline
gravely
i
can
not
accept
his
conclusions
i
liked
the
discourse
particularly
pauline
i
wish
percy
could
have
heard
it
said
lockhart
the
daughter
took
no
notice
whatever
of
this
considerate
speech
and
sat
quite
still
looking
more
serious
than
beulah
had
ever
seen
her
conversation
flagged
despite
the
young
teacher
efforts
and
she
was
heartily
glad
when
the
carriage
entered
the
avenue
her
heart
swelled
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
noble
old
cedars
whose
venerable
heads
seemed
to
bow
in
welcome
while
the
drooping
branches
held
out
their
arms
as
if
to
embrace
her
each
tree
was
familiar
even
the
bright
coral
yaupon
clusters
were
like
dear
friends
greeting
her
after
a
long
absence
she
had
never
realized
until
now
how
much
she
loved
this
home
of
her
early
childhood
and
large
drops
dimmed
her
eyes
as
she
passed
along
the
walks
where
she
had
so
often
wandered
the
carriage
approached
the
house
and
she
saw
her
quondam
guardian
standing
before
the
door
he
was
and
the
sunshine
fell
like
a
halo
upon
his
brown
clustering
hair
threading
it
with
gold
he
held
in
one
hand
a
small
basket
of
grain
from
which
he
fed
a
flock
of
hungry
pigeons
on
every
side
they
gathered
about
him
blue
and
white
brown
and
mottled
some
fluttering
down
from
the
roof
of
the
house
two
or
three
quite
tame
perched
on
his
arm
eating
from
the
basket
and
one
of
uncommon
beauty
sat
on
his
shoulder
cooing
softly
by
his
side
stood
charon
looking
gravely
on
as
if
he
wise
soul
thought
this
familiarity
signally
impudent
it
was
a
singularly
quiet
peaceful
scene
which
indelibly
daguerreotyped
itself
on
beulah
memory
as
the
carriage
whirled
round
the
circle
and
drew
up
at
the
door
the
startled
flock
wheeled
off
and
brushing
the
grain
from
his
hands
hartwell
advanced
to
assist
his
sister
pauline
sprang
out
first
exclaiming
you
abominable
heathen
why
did
you
come
to
church
even
asbury
was
out
guy
you
missed
an
admirable
sermon
chimed
in
lockhart
he
was
disengaging
the
fringe
of
pauline
shawl
which
caught
the
button
of
his
coat
and
looking
up
as
his
sister
spoke
his
eyes
met
beulah
anxious
gaze
she
had
wondered
very
much
how
he
would
receive
her
his
countenance
expressed
neither
surprise
nor
pleasure
he
merely
held
out
his
hand
to
assist
her
saying
in
his
usual
grave
manner
i
am
glad
to
see
you
beulah
she
looked
up
in
his
face
for
some
trace
of
the
old
kindness
but
the
rare
fascinating
smile
and
protective
tenderness
had
utterly
vanished
he
returned
her
look
with
a
calmly
indifferent
glance
which
pained
her
more
than
any
amount
of
sternness
could
have
done
she
snatched
her
hand
from
his
and
missing
the
carriage
step
would
have
fallen
but
he
caught
and
placed
her
safely
on
the
ground
saying
coolly
take
care
you
are
awkward
she
followed
pauline
up
the
steps
wishing
herself
at
home
in
her
little
room
but
her
companion
gay
chat
diverted
her
mind
and
she
only
remembered
how
very
beautiful
was
the
face
she
looked
on
they
stood
together
before
a
mirror
smoothing
their
hair
and
beulah
could
not
avoid
contrasting
the
images
reflected
one
was
prematurely
grave
and
thoughtful
in
its
expression
the
other
radiant
with
happy
hopes
pauline
surmised
what
was
passing
in
her
friend
mind
and
said
merrily
for
shame
beulah
to
envy
me
my
poor
estate
of
good
looks
why
i
am
all
nose
and
eyes
curls
red
lips
and
cheeks
but
you
have
an
additional
amount
of
brains
to
balance
my
gifts
once
i
heard
uncle
guy
say
that
you
had
more
intellect
than
all
the
other
women
and
children
in
the
town
come
lockhart
wants
to
see
you
very
much
she
ran
down
the
steps
as
heedlessly
as
in
her
childhood
and
beulah
followed
her
more
leisurely
in
the
study
they
found
the
remainder
of
the
party
lockhart
was
wrapt
in
a
heavy
and
reclined
on
the
sofa
he
welcomed
beulah
very
warmly
keeping
her
hand
in
his
and
making
her
sit
down
near
him
he
was
emaciated
and
a
hacking
cough
prevented
his
taking
any
active
part
in
the
conversation
one
glance
at
his
sad
face
sufficed
to
show
her
that
his
days
on
earth
were
numbered
and
the
expression
with
which
he
regarded
his
wife
told
all
the
painful
tale
of
an
unhappy
marriage
she
was
discussing
the
sermon
and
declaring
herself
highly
gratified
at
the
impression
which
mortimor
had
evidently
made
on
his
large
and
fashionable
congregation
hartwell
stood
on
the
hearth
listening
in
silence
to
his
sister
remarks
the
atlantic
might
have
rolled
between
them
for
any
interest
he
evinced
in
the
subject
pauline
was
restless
and
excited
finally
she
crossed
the
room
stood
close
to
her
uncle
and
carelessly
fingering
his
watch
chain
said
earnestly
uncle
guy
what
did
ernest
mean
this
morning
by
a
a
land
where
learned
men
are
captivated
by
blue
eyes
and
rosy
lips
answered
the
doctor
looking
down
into
her
sparkling
face
as
they
stood
together
beulah
remarked
how
very
much
pauline
resembled
him
true
he
was
pale
and
she
was
a
very
hebe
but
the
dazzling
transparency
of
the
complexion
was
the
same
the
silky
hair
the
same
and
the
classical
chiseling
of
mouth
and
nose
identical
her
eyes
were
deeply
darkly
matchlessly
blue
and
his
were
hazel
her
features
were
quivering
with
youthful
joyousness
and
enthusiasm
his
might
have
been
carved
in
ivory
they
seemed
so
inflexible
still
they
were
alike
pauline
did
not
exactly
relish
the
tone
of
his
reply
and
said
hastily
uncle
guy
i
wish
you
would
not
treat
me
as
if
i
were
an
idiot
or
what
is
not
much
better
a
child
how
am
i
ever
to
learn
any
sense
indeed
i
have
no
idea
said
he
passing
his
soft
hand
over
her
glossy
curls
you
are
very
provoking
do
you
want
ernest
to
think
me
a
fool
have
you
waked
to
a
consciousness
of
that
danger
yes
and
i
want
you
to
teach
me
something
come
tell
me
what
that
thing
is
i
asked
you
about
tell
you
what
why
what
a
a
is
said
she
earnestly
beulah
could
not
avoid
smiling
and
wondered
how
he
managed
to
look
so
very
serious
as
he
replied
i
know
very
little
about
the
tactics
of
but
believe
a
phalange
is
a
community
or
association
of
about
eighteen
hundred
persons
who
were
supposed
or
intended
to
practice
the
fourieristic
doctrines
in
fine
a
phalange
is
a
sort
of
french
utopia
and
where
is
that
sir
asked
pauline
innocently
without
taking
her
eyes
from
his
face
utopia
is
situated
in
and
its
chief
city
is
on
the
banks
of
the
river
waterless
oh
uncle
guy
how
can
you
quiz
me
so
unmercifully
when
i
ask
you
to
explain
things
to
me
why
pauline
i
am
answering
your
questions
correctly
sir
thomas
more
professed
to
describe
utopia
which
means
and
mentions
a
river
waterless
do
look
so
desperately
lofty
i
will
show
you
the
book
if
you
are
so
incorrigibly
stupid
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
as
he
spoke
and
kept
her
close
beside
him
lockhart
is
he
telling
the
truth
cried
she
incredulously
certainly
he
is
answered
her
stepfather
smiling
oh
i
do
believe
either
of
you
you
two
think
that
i
am
simple
enough
to
believe
any
absurdity
you
choose
to
tell
me
beulah
what
is
utopia
just
what
your
uncle
told
you
more
used
greek
words
which
signified
nothing
in
order
to
veil
the
satire
oh
a
satire
now
what
is
the
reason
you
could
not
say
it
was
a
satire
you
wiseacre
because
i
gave
you
credit
for
some
penetration
and
at
least
common
sense
both
of
which
i
have
proved
myself
devoid
of
i
suppose
thank
you
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
kissed
him
once
or
twice
and
laughingly
added
come
now
uncle
guy
tell
me
what
these
as
you
call
them
have
to
do
with
ernest
text
i
really
can
not
inform
you
there
is
the
dinner
bell
unclasping
her
arms
he
led
the
way
to
the
dining
room
later
in
the
afternoon
lockhart
retired
to
his
own
room
his
wife
fell
asleep
on
the
sofa
and
beulah
and
pauline
sat
at
the
parlor
window
discussing
the
various
occurrences
of
their
long
separation
pauline
talked
of
her
future
how
bright
it
was
how
very
much
she
and
ernest
loved
each
other
and
how
busy
she
would
be
when
she
had
a
home
of
her
own
she
supposed
she
would
be
obliged
to
give
up
dancing
she
had
an
indistinct
idea
that
preachers
wives
were
not
in
the
habit
of
indulging
in
any
such
amusements
and
as
for
the
theater
and
opera
she
rather
doubted
whether
either
were
to
be
found
in
the
inland
town
where
she
was
to
reside
uncle
guy
wished
to
furnish
the
parsonage
and
among
other
things
had
ordered
an
elegant
piano
for
her
she
intended
to
practice
a
great
deal
because
ernest
was
so
fond
of
music
uncle
guy
had
a
hateful
habit
of
lecturing
her
about
domestic
affairs
but
she
imagined
the
cook
would
understand
her
own
business
and
if
mortimor
supposed
she
was
going
to
play
housemaid
why
she
would
very
soon
undeceive
him
beulah
was
much
amused
at
the
childlike
simplicity
with
which
she
discussed
her
future
and
began
to
think
the
whole
affair
rather
ludicrous
when
pauline
started
and
exclaimed
as
the
blood
dyed
her
cheeks
there
is
ernest
coming
up
the
walk
he
came
in
and
greeted
her
with
gentle
gravity
he
was
a
dignified
man
with
polished
manners
and
perfect
there
was
no
trace
of
austerity
in
his
countenance
and
nothing
in
his
conversation
betokening
a
desire
to
impress
strangers
with
his
ministerial
dignity
he
was
highly
cultivated
in
all
his
tastes
agreeable
and
in
fine
a
christian
gentleman
pauline
seemed
to
consider
his
remarks
oracular
and
beulah
could
not
forbear
contrasting
her
quietness
in
his
presence
with
the
wild
frolicsome
recklessness
which
characterized
her
manner
on
other
occasions
she
wondered
what
singular
freak
induced
this
staid
learned
clergyman
to
select
a
companion
so
absolutely
antagonistic
in
every
element
of
character
but
a
glance
at
pauline
perfectly
beautiful
face
explained
the
mystery
how
could
anyone
help
loving
her
she
was
so
radiant
and
so
winning
in
her
unaffected
artlessness
beulah
conjectured
that
they
might
perhaps
entertain
each
other
without
her
assistance
and
soon
left
them
for
the
greenhouse
which
was
connected
with
the
parlors
by
a
glass
door
followed
by
charon
who
had
remained
beside
her
all
day
she
walked
slowly
between
the
rows
of
plants
many
of
which
were
laden
with
flowers
brilliant
clusters
of
scarlet
geranium
pale
fragrant
heliotropes
and
camellias
of
every
hue
surrounded
her
two
or
three
canary
birds
in
richly
ornate
cages
chirped
and
twittered
continually
and
for
a
moment
she
forgot
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
since
the
days
when
she
sought
this
favorite
greenhouse
to
study
her
near
her
stood
an
antique
china
vase
containing
a
rare
creeper
now
full
of
beautiful
lilac
flowers
many
months
before
her
guardian
had
given
her
this
root
and
she
had
planted
it
in
this
same
vase
now
the
long
graceful
wreaths
were
looped
carefully
back
and
tied
to
a
slender
stake
she
bent
over
the
fragrant
blossoms
with
a
heart
brimful
of
memories
and
tears
dropped
thick
and
fast
on
the
delicate
petals
charon
gave
a
short
bark
of
satisfaction
and
raising
her
head
she
saw
hartwell
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
greenhouse
he
was
clipping
the
withered
flowers
from
a
luxuriant
white
japonica
the
same
that
once
furnished
ornaments
for
her
hair
evidently
he
was
rather
surprised
to
see
her
there
but
continued
clipping
the
faded
blossoms
and
whistled
to
his
dog
charon
acknowledged
the
invitation
by
another
bark
but
nestled
his
great
head
against
beulah
and
stood
quite
still
while
she
passed
her
hand
caressingly
over
him
she
fancied
a
smile
crossed
her
guardian
lips
but
when
he
turned
toward
her
there
was
no
trace
of
it
and
he
merely
said
where
is
pauline
in
the
parlor
with
mr
mortimer
here
are
the
scissors
cut
as
many
flowers
as
you
like
he
held
out
the
scissors
but
she
shook
her
head
and
answered
hastily
thank
you
i
do
not
want
any
he
looked
at
her
searchingly
and
observing
unshed
tears
in
her
eyes
said
in
a
kinder
tone
than
he
had
yet
employed
beulah
what
do
you
want
something
that
i
almost
despair
of
obtaining
child
you
are
wasting
your
strength
and
energies
in
a
fruitless
undertaking
already
you
have
grown
thin
and
your
accustomed
contented
cheerful
spirit
is
deserting
you
your
appointed
task
is
a
hopeless
one
utterly
hopeless
i
will
not
believe
it
said
she
firmly
very
well
some
day
you
will
be
convinced
that
you
are
not
infallible
he
smiled
grimly
and
busied
himself
with
his
flowers
sir
you
could
help
me
if
you
would
she
clasped
her
hands
over
his
arm
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
his
countenance
with
all
the
confidence
and
dependence
of
other
days
did
i
ever
refuse
you
anything
you
asked
said
he
looking
down
at
the
little
hands
on
his
arm
and
at
the
pale
anxious
face
with
its
deep
troubled
eyes
no
and
it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
i
ask
assistance
from
you
now
i
suppose
you
are
reduced
to
the
last
necessity
what
has
become
of
your
pride
beulah
it
is
all
here
in
my
heart
sir
thundering
to
me
to
walk
out
and
leave
you
since
you
are
so
unlike
yourself
he
looked
stern
and
indescribably
sad
she
glanced
up
an
instant
at
his
fascinating
eyes
and
then
laying
her
head
down
on
his
arm
as
she
used
to
do
in
childhood
said
resolutely
oh
sir
you
must
aid
me
whom
have
i
to
advise
me
but
you
my
advice
has
about
as
much
weight
with
you
as
charon
would
could
he
utter
it
i
am
an
admirable
counselor
only
so
long
as
my
opinions
harmonize
with
the
dictates
of
your
own
will
how
am
i
to
aid
you
i
went
at
twelve
last
night
to
see
a
dying
man
and
passing
along
the
street
saw
a
light
burning
from
your
window
two
hours
later
as
i
returned
it
glimmered
there
still
why
were
you
up
beulah
what
is
the
matter
with
you
has
your
last
treatise
on
the
of
ideas
run
away
with
those
of
its
author
and
landed
you
both
in
a
region
of
vagaries
remember
i
warned
you
something
worse
sir
perhaps
german
metaphysics
have
stranded
you
on
the
bleak
bald
cliffs
of
pyrrhonism
sir
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
great
deal
of
unmerited
odium
laid
upon
the
innocent
shoulders
of
german
metaphysics
people
declaim
against
the
science
of
metaphysics
as
if
it
were
the
disease
itself
whereas
it
is
the
remedy
metaphysics
do
not
originate
the
trouble
their
very
existence
proves
the
priority
of
the
disease
which
they
attempt
to
relieve
decidedly
a
homeopathic
remedy
interrupted
her
guardian
smiling
but
sir
the
questions
which
disturb
my
mind
are
older
than
my
acquaintance
with
philosophic
works
they
have
troubled
me
from
my
childhood
nevertheless
i
warned
you
not
to
explore
my
library
said
he
with
a
touch
of
sorrow
in
his
voice
how
then
can
you
habitually
read
books
which
you
are
unwilling
to
put
into
my
hands
to
me
all
creeds
and
systems
are
alike
null
with
you
beulah
it
was
once
very
different
once
yes
once
she
shuddered
at
the
wild
waste
into
which
she
had
strayed
what
are
the
questions
that
have
so
long
disturbed
you
questions
sir
which
all
my
life
have
been
printed
on
evening
clouds
on
rosy
sea
shells
on
pale
sweet
delicate
blossoms
and
which
i
have
unavailingly
sought
to
answer
for
myself
there
are
mysteries
in
physics
morals
and
metaphysics
that
have
wooed
me
on
to
an
investigation
but
the
further
i
wander
deeper
grows
the
darkness
alone
and
unaided
i
have
been
forced
to
brave
these
doubts
i
have
studied
and
read
and
thought
cloudy
symbolisms
mock
me
on
every
side
and
the
more
earnestly
i
strive
to
overtake
truth
the
tighter
grow
my
eyes
now
sir
you
are
much
older
you
have
scaled
the
dizzy
heights
of
science
and
carefully
explored
the
mines
of
philosophy
and
if
human
learning
will
avail
then
you
can
help
me
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
have
lived
and
studied
so
long
without
arriving
at
some
conclusion
relative
to
these
vexing
questions
of
this
and
every
other
age
i
want
to
know
whether
i
have
ever
lived
before
whether
there
is
not
an
anterior
life
of
my
soul
of
which
i
get
occasional
glimpses
and
the
memory
of
which
haunts
and
disquiets
me
this
doubt
has
not
been
engendered
by
casual
allusions
to
plato
theory
before
i
knew
there
was
such
a
doctrine
in
existence
i
have
sat
by
your
study
fire
pondering
some
strange
coincidences
for
which
i
could
not
account
it
seemed
an
indistinct
outgoing
into
the
far
past
a
dim
recollection
of
scenes
and
ideas
older
than
the
aggregate
of
my
birthdays
now
a
flickering
light
then
all
darkness
no
clew
all
shrouded
in
the
mystery
of
voiceless
ages
i
tried
to
explain
these
psychological
phenomena
by
the
theory
of
association
of
ideas
but
they
eluded
an
analysis
there
was
no
chain
along
which
memory
can
pass
they
were
like
ignes
fatui
flashing
up
from
dank
caverns
and
dying
out
while
i
looked
upon
them
as
i
grew
older
i
found
strange
confirmation
in
those
curious
passages
of
coleridge
and
wordsworth
footnote
coleridge
sonnet
on
the
birth
of
a
son
ode
intimations
of
immortality
and
continually
i
propound
to
my
soul
these
questions
you
are
immortal
and
will
exist
through
endless
ages
have
you
not
existed
from
the
beginning
of
time
immortality
knows
neither
commencement
nor
ending
if
so
whither
shall
i
go
when
this
material
framework
is
dissolved
to
make
other
frameworks
to
a
final
rest
or
shall
the
i
the
me
the
soul
lose
its
former
identity
am
i
a
minute
constituent
of
the
spirit
a
breath
of
the
infinite
essence
one
day
to
be
divested
of
my
individuality
or
is
god
an
awful
gigantic
immutable
isolated
personality
if
so
what
medium
of
communication
is
afforded
can
the
spiritual
commune
with
matter
can
the
material
take
cognizance
of
the
purely
spiritual
and
divine
oh
sir
i
know
that
you
do
not
accept
the
holy
men
of
galilee
as
his
deputed
oracles
tell
me
where
you
find
surer
prophets
only
show
me
the
truth
the
eternal
truth
and
i
would
give
my
life
for
it
sir
how
can
you
smile
at
such
questions
as
these
questions
involving
the
soul
destiny
one
might
fancy
you
a
second
parrhasius
she
drew
back
a
step
or
two
and
regarded
him
anxiously
nay
pleadingly
as
though
he
held
the
key
to
the
temple
of
truth
and
would
not
suffer
her
to
pass
the
portal
a
sarcastic
smile
lighted
his
face
as
he
answered
there
is
more
truth
in
your
metaphor
than
you
imagined
a
la
parrhasius
i
do
see
you
a
tortured
prometheus
chained
by
links
of
your
own
forging
to
the
caucasus
of
atheism
but
listen
to
no
no
not
that
not
atheism
god
save
me
from
that
deepest
blackest
gulf
she
shuddered
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
beulah
you
alone
must
settle
these
questions
with
your
own
soul
my
solutions
would
not
satisfy
you
for
thousands
of
years
they
have
been
propounded
and
yet
no
answer
comes
down
on
the
wings
of
centuries
each
must
solve
to
suit
his
or
her
peculiar
conformation
of

my
child
if
i
could
aid
you
i
would
gladly
do
so
but
i
am
no
swedenborg
to
whom
the
arcana
of
the
universe
have
been
revealed
still
after
a
fashion
you
have
solved
these
problems
may
i
not
know
what
your
faith
is
said
she
earnestly
child
i
have
no
faith
i
know
that
i
exist
that
a
beautiful
universe
surrounds
me
and
i
am
conscious
of
a
multitude
of
conflicting
emotions
but
like
launcelot
smith
i
doubt
whether
i
am
pick
and
choose
myself
out
of
myself
further
than
this
i
would
assure
you
of
nothing
i
stand
on
the
everlasting
basis
of
all
skepticism
is
no
criterion
of
truth
all
must
be
but
subjectively
relatively
true
sir
this
may
be
so
as
regards
psychological
abstractions
but
can
you
be
contented
with
this
utter
negation
of
the
grand
problems
of
ontology
a
profound
philosophic
writer
of
the
age
intimates
that
the
various
psychological
systems
which
have
so
long
vexed
the
world
are
but
veiled
ontologic
speculations
what
matters
the
machinery
of
ideas
but
as
enabling
philosophy
to
cope
successfully
with
ontology
philosophy
is
a
huge
wheel
which
has
been
revolving
for
ages
early
metaphysicians
hung
their
finely
spun
webs
on
its
spokes
and
metaphysicians
of
the
nineteenth
century
gaze
upon
and
renew
the
same
pretty
theories
as
the
wheel
revolves
the
history
of
philosophy
shows
but
a
reproduction
of
old
systems
and
methods
of
inquiry
beulah
no
mine
of
ontologic
truth
has
been
discovered
conscious
of
this
our
seers
tell
us
there
is
nothing
now
but
ontology
is
old
as
human
nature
yet
the
stone
of
sisyphus
continues
to
roll
back
upon
the
laboring
few
who
strive
to
impel
it
upward
oh
child
do
you
not
see
how
matters
stand
why
how
can
the
finite
soul
cope
with
infinite
being
this
is
one
form
the
other
if
we
can
take
cognizance
of
the
eternal
and
existing
being
underlying
all
phenomena
why
then
we
are
part
and
parcel
of
that
infinity
pantheism
or
utter
skepticism
there
is
no
retreat
i
do
want
to
believe
that
sir
i
will
not
believe
it
what
was
my
reason
given
to
me
for
was
this
spirit
of
inquiry
after
truth
only
awakened
in
my
soul
to
mock
me
with
a
sense
of
my
nothingness
why
did
my
maker
imbue
me
with
an
insatiable
thirst
for
knowledge
knowledge
of
the
deep
things
of
philosophy
the
hidden
wonders
of
the
universe
the
awful
mysteries
of
the
shadowy
spirit
realm
oh
there
are
analogies
pervading
all
departments
there
is
physical
hunger
to
goad
to
exertions
which
will
satisfy
its
demands
and
most
tonics
are
bitter
so
bitter
struggles
develop
and
strengthen
the
soul
even
as
hard
study
invigorates
the
mind
and
numerous
sorrows
chasten
the
heart
there
is
truth
for
the
earnest
seeker
somewhere
somewhere
if
i
live
a
thousand
years
i
will
toil
after
it
till
i
find
it
if
as
you
believe
death
is
annihilation
then
will
i
make
the
most
of
my
soul
while
i
have
it
oh
sir
what
is
life
for
merely
to
eat
and
drink
to
sleep
and
be
clothed
is
it
to
be
only
a
constant
effort
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
if
i
thought
so
i
would
rather
go
back
to
nothingness
this
day
this
hour
no
no
my
name
bids
me
press
on
there
is
a
land
of
beulah
somewhere
for
my
troubled
spirit
oh
i
will
go
back
to
my
humble
home
and
study
on
unguided
unassisted
even
as
i
have
begun
i
can
not
rest
on
your
rock
of
negation
she
could
not
control
her
trembling
voice
and
tears
of
bitter
disappointment
fell
over
her
pale
fixed
features
a
melancholy
smile
parted
hartwell
lips
and
smoothing
the
bands
of
rippling
hair
which
lay
on
her
white
brow
he
answered
in
his
own
thrilling
musical
accents
child
you
are
wasting
your
energies
in
vain
endeavors
to
build
up
walls
of
foam
that
sir
i
am
no
longer
a
child
i
am
a
woman
and
yes
my
little
beulah
and
your
woman
heart
will
not
be
satisfied
long
with
these
dim
abstractions
which
now
you
chase
so
eagerly
mark
me
there
surely
comes
a
time
when
you
will
loathe
the
bare
name
of
metaphysics
you
are
making
a
very
hotbed
of
your
intellect
while
you
heart
is
daily
becoming
a
dreary
desert
take
care
lest
the
starvation
be
so
complete
that
eventually
you
will
be
unable
to
reclaim
it
dialectics
answer
very
well
in
collegiate
halls
but
will
not
content
you
remember
she
is
a
miserable
libel
on
woman
nature
and
intellect
i
scorn
the
attempted
parallel
answered
beulah
indignantly
very
well
mark
me
though
your
intellectual
pride
will
yet
wreck
your
happiness
he
walked
out
of
the
greenhouse
whistling
to
charon
who
bounded
after
him
beulah
saw
from
the
slanting
sunlight
that
the
afternoon
was
far
advanced
and
feeling
in
no
mood
to
listen
to
nonsense
she
found
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
repaired
to
the
parlor
to
say
to
the
happy
pair
who
seemed
unconscious
of
her
long
absence
as
she
left
the
house
the
window
of
the
study
was
thrown
open
and
hartwell
called
out
carelessly
wait
and
let
me
order
the
carriage
no
thank
you
i
am
going
into
town
directly
and
can
take
you
home
in
the
buggy
i
will
not
trouble
you
i
prefer
walking
he
bowed
coldly
and
she
hurried
away
glad
to
reach
the
gate
and
feel
that
she
was
once
more
free
from
his
searching
glance
and
beyond
the
sound
of
his
reserved
chilling
tones
as
she
walked
on
groups
of
happy
parents
and
children
were
seen
in
every
direction
taking
their
quiet
sabbath
ramble
through
the
suburbs
and
as
joyous
voices
and
innocent
laughter
fell
upon
the
still
air
she
remembered
with
keen
sorrow
that
she
had
no
ties
no
kindred
no
companions
lilly
cherub
face
looked
out
at
her
from
the
somber
frame
of
the
past
and
eugene
early
friendship
seemed
now
a
taunting
specter
in
her
warm
loving
heart
were
unfathomable
depths
of
intense
tenderness
was
it
the
wise
providence
of
god
which
sealed
these
wells
of
affection
or
was
it
a
grim
merciless
fate
which
snatched
her
idols
from
her
one
by
one
and
left
her
heart
desolate
such
an
inquiry
darted
through
her
mind
but
she
put
it
resolutely
aside
and
consoled
herself
much
after
this
fashion
why
should
i
question
the
circumstances
of
my
life
if
the
god
of
moses
guards
his
creation
all
things
are
well
if
not
life
is
a
lottery
and
though
i
have
drawn
blanks
thus
far
the
future
may
contain
a
prize
and
for
me
that
prize
may
be
the
truth
my
soul
pants
after
i
have
no
right
to
complain
the
very
loneliness
of
my
position
fits
me
peculiarly
for
the
work
i
have
to
do
i
will
labor
and
be
content
the
cloud
passed
swiftly
from
her
countenance
and
she
looked
up
to
the
quiet
sky
with
a
brave
hopeful
heart
chapter
xxv
among
the
number
of
gentlemen
whom
beulah
occasionally
met
at
asbury
house
were
two
whose
frequent
visits
and
general
demeanor
induced
the
impression
that
they
were
more
than
ordinarily
interested
in
the
sisters
frederick
vincent
evinced
a
marked
preference
for
georgia
while
horace
maxwell
was
conspicuously
attentive
to
helen
the
former
was
wealthy
handsome
indolent
and
the
latter
rather
superior
as
to
business
habits
which
a
limited
purse
peremptorily
demanded
doubtless
both
would
have
passed
as
men
of
medium
capacity
but
certainly
as
nothing
more
in
fine
they
were
fair
samples
perfect
types
of
the
numerous
class
of
fashionable
young
men
who
throng
all
large
cities
looking
vain
impudent
heartless
frivolous
and
dissipated
adepts
at
the
gaming
table
and
pistol
gallery
ciphers
in
an
intelligent
refined
assembly
they
smoked
the
choicest
cigars
drank
the
most
costly
wines
drove
the
fastest
horses
and
were
indispensable
at
champagne
and
oyster
suppers
they
danced
and
swore
visited
and
drank
with
reckless
indifference
to
every
purer
and
nobler
aim
notwithstanding
manners
of
incorrigible
effrontery
which
characterized
their
clique
the
ladies
always
received
them
with
marked
expressions
of
pleasure
and
the
entree
of
the
first
circle
was
certainly
theirs
asbury
knew
comparatively
little
of
the
young
men
who
visited
so
constantly
at
his
house
but
of
the
two
under
discussion
he
chanced
to
know
that
they
were
by
no
means
models
of
sobriety
having
met
them
late
one
night
as
they
supported
each
other
tottering
forms
homeward
after
a
card
and
wine
party
which
ended
rather
disastrously
for
both
he
openly
avowed
his
discontent
at
the
intimacy
their
frequent
visits
induced
and
wondered
how
his
daughters
could
patiently
indulge
in
the
heartless
which
alone
could
entertain
them
but
he
was
a
fond
almost
doting
father
and
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
they
were
mere
dancing
acquaintances
whose
society
must
be
endured
asbury
was
not
so
blind
and
discovered
with
keen
sorrow
and
dismay
that
georgia
was
far
more
partial
to
vincent
than
she
had
dreamed
possible
the
mother
heart
ached
with
dread
lest
her
child
affections
were
really
enlisted
and
without
her
knowledge
she
passed
many
hours
of
bitter
reflection
as
to
the
best
course
she
should
pursue
to
arrest
vincent
intimacy
at
the
house
only
a
woman
knows
woman
heart
and
she
felt
that
destiny
would
be
decided
by
the
measures
she
now
employed
ridicule
invective
and
even
remonstrance
she
knew
would
only
augment
her
interest
in
one
whom
she
considered
unjustly
dealt
with
she
was
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
obstinacy
which
formed
the
stamen
of
georgia
character
and
very
cautiously
the
maternal
guidance
must
be
given
she
began
by
gravely
regretting
the
familiar
footing
vincent
had
acquired
in
her
family
and
urged
upon
georgia
and
helen
the
propriety
of
discouraging
attentions
that
justified
the
world
in
joining
their
names
this
had
very
little
effect
she
was
conscious
that
because
of
his
wealth
vincent
was
courted
and
flattered
by
the
most
select
and
fashionable
of
her
circle
of
acquaintances
and
knew
alas
that
he
was
not
more
astray
than
the
majority
of
the
class
of
young
men
to
which
he
belonged
with
a
keen
pang
she
saw
that
her
child
shrank
from
her
evaded
her
kind
questions
and
seemed
to
plunge
into
the
festivities
of
the
season
with
unwonted
zest
from
their
birth
she
had
trained
her
daughters
to
confide
unreservedly
in
her
and
now
to
perceive
the
youngest
avoiding
her
caresses
or
hurrying
away
from
her
anxious
glance
was
bitter
indeed
how
her
darling
could
tolerate
the
reckless
frivolous
being
in
whose
society
she
seemed
so
well
satisfied
was
a
painful
mystery
but
the
startling
reality
looked
her
in
the
face
and
she
resolved
at
every
hazard
to
save
her
from
the
misery
which
was
in
store
for
fred
vincent
wife
beulah
quick
eye
readily
discerned
the
state
of
affairs
relative
to
georgia
and
vincent
and
she
could
with
difficulty
restrain
an
expression
of
the
disgust
a
knowledge
of
his
character
inspired
he
was
a
brother
of
the
miss
vincent
she
had
once
seen
at
hartwell
and
probably
this
circumstance
increased
her
dislike
vincent
barely
recognized
her
when
they
chanced
to
meet
and
of
all
his
antipathies
hatred
of
beulah
predominated
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
she
despised
his
weaknesses
and
detested
his
immoralities
and
while
he
shrank
from
the
steadfast
gray
eyes
calm
but
contemptuous
he
hated
her
heartily
cornelia
graham
seemed
for
a
time
to
have
rallied
all
her
strength
and
attended
parties
and
kept
her
place
at
the
opera
with
a
regularity
which
argued
a
complete
recovery
antoinette
dupres
was
admired
and
nattered
the
season
was
unusually
gay
what
if
death
had
so
lately
held
his
awful
assize
in
the
city
bereaved
families
wrapped
their
sable
garments
about
lonely
hearts
and
wept
over
the
countless
mounds
in
the
cemetery
but
the
and
song
and
dance
went
their
accustomed
rounds
in
fashionable
quarters
and
drink
dress
and
be
merry
appeared
the
thought
into
this
gayety
eugene
graham
eagerly
plunged
night
after
night
was
spent
in
one
continued
whirl
day
by
day
he
wandered
further
astray
and
ere
long
his
visits
to
beulah
ceased
entirely
antoinette
thoroughly
understood
the
game
she
had
to
play
and
easily
and
rapidly
he
fell
into
the
snare
to
win
her
seemed
his
only
wish
and
not
even
cornelia
keenly
searching
eyes
could
check
his
admiration
and
devotion
january
had
gone
february
drew
near
its
close
beulah
had
not
seen
eugene
for
many
days
and
felt
more
than
usually
anxious
concerning
him
for
little
intercourse
now
existed
between
cornelia
and
herself
one
evening
however
as
she
stood
before
a
glass
and
arranged
her
hair
with
more
than
ordinary
care
she
felt
that
she
would
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
judging
whether
reports
were
true
if
he
indeed
rushed
along
the
highway
to
ruin
one
glance
would
discover
to
her
the
fact
asbury
wished
to
give
pauline
chilton
a
party
and
his
own
and
asbury
kind
persuasions
induced
the
orphan
to
consent
to
attend
the
evening
had
arrived
she
put
on
her
simple
swiss
muslin
dress
without
a
wish
for
anything
more
costly
and
entered
the
carriage
her
friends
had
sent
to
convey
her
to
the
house
the
guests
rapidly
assembled
soon
the
rooms
were
thronged
with
merry
people
whose
moving
to
and
fro
prevented
regular
conversation
the
brilliant
chandeliers
flashed
down
on
rich
silks
and
satins
gossamer
fabrics
and
diamonds
which
blazed
dazzlingly
pauline
was
superbly
beautiful
excitement
lighted
her
eyes
and
flushed
her
cheeks
until
all
paused
to
gaze
at
her
transcendent
loveliness
it
was
generally
known
that
ere
many
days
her
marriage
would
take
place
and
people
looked
at
her
in
her
marvelous
queenly
beauty
and
wondered
what
infatuation
induced
her
to
give
her
hand
to
a
minister
when
she
of
all
others
present
seemed
made
to
move
in
the
gay
scene
where
she
reigned
supreme
from
a
quiet
seat
near
the
window
beulah
watched
her
airy
graceful
form
glide
through
the
quadrille
and
feared
that
in
future
years
she
would
sigh
for
the
gayeties
which
in
her
destined
lot
would
be
withheld
from
her
she
tried
to
fancy
the
dazzling
beauty
metamorphosed
into
the
staid
clergyman
wife
divested
of
satin
and
diamonds
and
visiting
the
squalid
and
suffering
portion
of
her
husband
flock
but
the
contrast
was
too
glaring
and
she
turned
her
head
to
watch
for
eugene
appearance
before
long
she
saw
him
cross
the
room
with
antoinette
on
his
arm
the
quadrille
had
ended
and
as
at
the
request
of
one
of
the
guests
the
band
played
a
brilliant
mazourka
numerous
couples
took
their
places
on
the
floor
beulah
had
never
seen
the
mazourka
danced
in
public
she
knew
that
neither
helen
nor
georgia
ever
danced
the
fancy
dances
and
was
not
a
little
surprised
when
the
gentlemen
encircled
the
waists
of
their
partners
and
whirled
away
her
eyes
followed
eugene
tall
form
as
the
circuit
of
the
parlors
was
rapidly
made
and
he
approached
the
corner
where
she
sat
he
held
his
lovely
partner
close
to
his
heart
and
her
head
drooped
very
contentedly
on
his
shoulder
he
was
talking
to
her
as
they
danced
and
his
lips
nearly
touched
her
glowing
cheek
on
they
came
so
close
to
beulah
that
gauzy
dress
floated
against
her
and
as
the
music
quickened
faster
flew
the
dancers
beulah
looked
on
with
a
sensation
of
disgust
which
might
have
been
easily
read
in
her
countenance
verily
she
blushed
for
her
degraded
sex
and
sick
of
the
scene
left
the
window
and
retreated
to
the
library
where
the
more
sedate
portion
of
the
guests
were
discussing
various
topics
here
were
and
grayson
claudia
was
north
at
school
beulah
found
a
seat
near
asbury
and
endeavored
to
banish
the
painful
recollections
which
grayson
face
recalled
they
had
not
met
since
the
memorable
day
when
the
orphan
first
found
a
guardian
and
she
felt
that
there
was
still
an
unconquerable
aversion
in
her
heart
which
caused
it
to
throb
heavily
she
thought
the
time
tediously
long
and
when
at
last
the
signal
for
supper
was
given
felt
relieved
as
usual
there
was
rushing
and
squeezing
into
the
supper
room
and
waiting
until
the
hall
was
comparatively
deserted
she
ran
up
to
the
dressing
room
for
her
shawl
tired
of
the
crowd
and
anxious
to
get
home
again
she
remembered
that
she
had
dropped
her
fan
behind
one
of
the
sofas
in
the
parlor
and
as
all
were
at
supper
fancied
she
could
obtain
it
unobserved
and
entered
the
room
for
that
purpose
a
gentleman
stood
by
the
fire
but
without
noticing
him
she
pushed
the
sofa
aside
secured
her
fan
and
was
turning
away
when
a
voice
startled
her
beulah
where
are
you
going
home
sir
what
so
soon
tired
yes
heartily
tired
said
she
wrapping
her
shawl
about
her
have
you
spoken
to
eugene
no
her
guardian
looked
at
her
very
intently
as
if
striving
to
read
her
soul
and
said
slowly
child
he
and
antoinette
are
sitting
in
the
front
parlor
i
happened
to
overhear
a
remark
as
i
passed
them
he
is
an
accepted
lover
they
are
engaged
a
quick
shiver
ran
over
beulah
frame
and
a
dark
frown
furrowed
her
pale
brow
as
she
answered
i
feared
as
much
why
should
you
fear
child
she
is
a
beautiful
heiress
and
he
loves
her
returned
hartwell
without
taking
his
eyes
from
her
face
no
he
thinks
he
loves
her
but
it
is
not
so
he
is
fascinated
by
her
beauty
but
i
fear
the
day
will
come
when
discovering
her
true
character
he
will
mourn
his
infatuation
i
know
his
nature
and
i
know
too
that
she
can
not
make
him
happy
she
turned
away
but
he
walked
on
with
her
to
the
carriage
handed
her
in
and
said
as
coldly
as
usual
meantime
the
rattle
of
plates
jingle
of
forks
and
spoons
in
the
supper
room
would
have
rendered
all
conversation
impossible
had
not
the
elevation
of
voices
kept
pace
with
the
noise
and
confusion
at
one
end
of
the
table
cornelia
graham
stood
talking
to
a
distinguished
foreigner
who
was
spending
a
few
days
in
the
city
he
was
a
handsome
man
with
fine
colloquial
powers
and
seemed
much
interested
in
a
discussion
which
he
and
cornelia
carried
on
relative
to
the
society
of
american
cities
as
compared
with
european
a
temporary
lull
in
the
hum
of
voices
allowed
cornelia
to
hear
a
remark
made
by
a
gentleman
quite
near
her
miss
laura
who
did
you
say
that
young
lady
was
that
asbury
introduced
me
to
the
one
with
such
magnificent
hair
and
teeth
his
companion
was
no
other
than
laura
martin
whose
mother
having
built
an
elegant
house
and
given
several
large
parties
was
now
a
fashionable
par
excellence
laura
elevated
her
nose
very
perceptibly
and
answered
oh
a
mere
nobody
beulah
benton
i
ca
imagine
how
she
contrived
to
be
invited
here
she
is
a
teacher
in
the
public
school
i
believe
but
that
is
not
the
worst
she
used
to
hire
herself
out
as
a
servant
indeed
it
is
a
fact
she
was
my
little
brother
nurse
some
years
ago
i
think
ma
hired
her
for
six
dollars
a
month
she
laughed
affectedly
and
allowed
her
escort
to
fill
her
plate
with
creams
cornelia
grew
white
with
anger
and
the
stranger
asked
with
a
smile
if
he
should
consider
this
a
sample
of
the
society
she
boasted
of
turning
abruptly
to
laura
she
replied
with
undisguised
contempt
the
fates
forbid
falconer
that
you
should
judge
american
society
from
some
of
the
specimens
you
may
see
here
misfortune
placed
miss
benton
at
an
early
age
in
an
orphan
asylum
and
while
quite
young
she
left
it
to
earn
a
support
martin
this
young
lady
mother
hired
her
as
a
nurse
but
she
soon
left
this
position
qualified
herself
to
teach
and
now
with
a
fine
intellect
thoroughly
cultivated
is
the
pride
of
all
who
can
appreciate
true
nobility
of
soul
and
of
course
an
object
of
envy
and
detraction
to
her
inferiors
especially
to
some
of
our
fashionable
parvenus
whose
prompts
them
to
make
money
alone
the
standard
of
worth
and
who
are
in
the
habit
of
determining
the
gentility
of
different
persons
by
what
they
have
not
what
they
are
her
scornful
glance
rested
witheringly
on
laura
face
and
mortified
and
enraged
the
latter
took
her
companion
arm
and
moved
away
i
have
some
desire
to
become
acquainted
with
one
who
could
deserve
such
eulogy
from
you
answered
the
foreigner
somewhat
amused
at
the
course
the
conversation
had
taken
and
quite
satisfied
that
americans
were
accustomed
to
correct
false
impressions
in
rather
an
abrupt
manner
i
will
present
you
to
her
with
great
pleasure
she
is
not
here
we
must
search
for
her
she
took
his
arm
and
they
looked
for
beulah
from
room
to
room
finally
hartwell
informed
cornelia
that
she
had
gone
home
and
tired
and
out
of
humor
the
latter
excused
herself
and
prepared
to
follow
her
friend
example
her
father
was
deep
in
a
game
of
whist
her
mother
unwilling
to
return
home
so
soon
and
eugene
and
antoinette
where
were
they
hartwell
saw
her
perplexed
expression
and
asked
whom
are
you
looking
for
eugene
he
is
with
your
cousin
on
the
west
gallery
i
will
conduct
you
to
them
if
you
wish
it
he
offered
his
arm
and
noticed
the
scowl
that
instantly
darkened
her
face
unconsciously
her
fingers
grasped
his
arm
tightly
and
she
walked
on
with
a
lowering
brow
as
they
approached
the
end
of
the
gallery
cornelia
saw
that
the
two
she
sought
stood
earnestly
conversing
eugene
arm
passed
round
antoinette
waist
hartwell
watched
his
companion
closely
the
light
from
the
window
gleamed
over
her
face
and
showed
it
gray
and
rigid
her
white
lips
curled
as
she
muttered
let
us
take
another
turn
before
i
speak
to
them
surely
you
are
not
surprised
oh
no
i
am
not
blind
it
was
an
unlucky
chance
that
threw
your
cousin
in
his
path
said
the
doctor
composedly
oh
it
is
merely
another
link
in
the
chain
of
fatality
which
binds
my
family
to
misfortune
she
has
all
the
family
traits
of
the
labords
and
you
know
what
they
are
cried
cornelia
he
compressed
his
lips
and
a
lightning
glance
shot
out
from
his
eyes
but
he
stilled
the
rising
tempest
and
replied
coldly
why
then
did
you
not
warn
him
warn
him
so
i
did
but
i
might
as
well
grasp
at
the
stars
yonder
as
hope
to
influence
him
in
this
infatuation
once
more
they
approached
the
happy
pair
and
leaning
forward
cornelia
said
hoarsely
eugene
my
father
is
engaged
come
home
with
me
he
looked
up
and
answered
carelessly
oh
you
are
leaving
too
early
ca
you
entertain
yourself
a
little
longer
no
sir
her
freezing
tone
startled
him
and
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
the
haggard
face
with
its
expression
of
angry
scorn
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
antoinette
who
only
smiled
and
looked
triumphantly
defiant
are
you
ill
cornelia
of
course
i
will
take
you
home
if
you
really
desire
it
doctor
i
must
consign
miss
dupres
to
your
care
till
i
return
eugene
by
no
means
relished
the
expression
of
his
countenance
she
bade
harwell
adieu
passed
her
arm
through
her
brother
and
they
proceeded
to
their
carriage
the
ride
was
short
and
silent
on
reaching
home
eugene
conducted
cornelia
into
the
house
and
was
about
to
return
when
she
said
imperiously
a
word
with
you
before
you
go
she
entered
the
sitting
room
threw
her
wrappings
on
a
chair
and
began
to
divest
herself
of
bracelets
and
necklace
eugene
lighted
a
cigar
and
stood
waiting
to
hear
what
she
might
choose
to
communicate
fastening
her
brilliant
black
eyes
on
his
face
she
said
sneeringly
eugene
graham
did
you
learn
dissimulation
in
the
halls
of
heidelberg
what
do
you
mean
cornelia
where
did
you
learn
to
deceive
one
who
believed
you
pure
and
truthful
as
an
archangel
answer
me
that
her
whole
face
was
a
glare
of
burning
scorn
insulting
insinuations
are
unworthy
of
you
and
beneath
my
notice
he
proudly
replied
well
then
take
the
more
insulting
truth
what
crawling
serpent
of
temptation
induced
you
to
tell
me
you
expected
to
marry
beulah
no
evasion
i
will
not
be
put
off
why
did
you
deceive
me
with
a
falsehood
i
was
too
stupidly
trusting
to
discover
until
recently
when
i
told
you
so
i
expected
to
marry
beulah
not
so
much
because
i
loved
her
but
because
i
supposed
that
she
rather
considered
me
bound
to
her
by
early
ties
i
discovered
however
that
her
happiness
was
not
dependent
on
me
and
therefore
abandoned
the
idea
and
my
peerless
cousin
is
to
be
your
bride
eh
yes
she
has
promised
me
her
hand
at
an
early
day
no
doubt
you
do
deserve
anything
better
beulah
scorns
you
i
see
it
in
her
eyes
marry
you
you
oh
eugene
she
is
far
too
superior
to
you
you
are
blind
now
but
the
day
will
surely
come
when
your
charmer
will
with
her
own
hand
tear
the
veil
from
your
eyes
and
you
will
curse
your
folly
it
is
of
no
use
to
tell
you
that
she
is
false
heartless
utterly
unprincipled
you
will
not
believe
it
of
course
till
you
find
out
her
miserable
defects
yourself
i
might
thunder
warnings
in
your
ears
from
now
till
doomsday
and
you
would
not
heed
me
but
whether
i
live
to
see
it
or
not
you
will
bitterly
rue
your
infatuation
you
will
blush
for
the
name
which
as
your
wife
antoinette
will
disgrace
now
leave
me
she
pointed
to
the
door
and
too
much
incensed
to
reply
he
quitted
the
room
with
a
suppressed
oath
slamming
the
door
behind
him
cornelia
went
up
to
her
own
apartment
and
without
ringing
for
her
maid
took
off
the
elegant
dress
she
wore
and
threw
her
dressing
gown
round
her
the
diamond
hairpins
glowed
like
coals
of
fire
in
her
black
braids
mocking
the
gray
bloodless
face
and
look
of
wretchedness
she
took
out
the
jewels
laid
them
on
her
lap
and
suffered
the
locks
of
hair
to
fall
upon
her
shoulders
then
great
hot
tears
rolled
over
her
face
heavy
sobs
convulsed
her
frame
and
bowing
down
her
head
the
haughty
heiress
wept
passionately
eugene
was
the
only
being
she
really
loved
for
years
her
hopes
and
pride
had
centered
in
him
now
down
the
long
vista
of
coming
time
she
looked
and
saw
him
staggering
on
to
ruin
and
disgrace
she
knew
her
own
life
would
at
best
be
short
and
felt
that
now
it
had
lost
its
only
interest
and
she
was
ready
to
sink
to
her
last
rest
rather
than
witness
his
future
career
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
wept
since
the
days
of
early
childhood
but
she
calmed
the
fearful
struggle
in
her
heart
and
toward
dawn
fell
asleep
with
a
repulsive
sneer
on
her
lips
the
ensuing
day
she
was
forced
to
listen
to
the
complacent
comments
of
her
parents
who
were
well
pleased
with
the
alliance
antoinette
was
to
return
home
immediately
the
marriage
would
take
place
in
june
and
they
were
all
to
spend
the
summer
at
the
north
after
which
it
was
suggested
that
the
young
couple
should
reside
with
graham
cornelia
was
standing
apart
when
her
mother
made
this
proposition
and
turning
sharply
toward
the
members
of
her
family
the
daughter
exclaimed
never
you
all
know
that
this
match
is
utterly
odious
to
me
let
eugene
have
a
house
of
his
own
i
have
no
mind
to
have
antoinette
longer
in
my
home
nay
father
it
will
not
be
for
a
great
while
when
i
am
gone
they
can
come
i
rather
think
i
shall
not
long
be
in
their
way
while
i
do
live
let
me
be
quiet
will
you
her
burning
yet
sunken
eyes
ran
over
the
group
eugene
sprang
up
and
left
the
room
antoinette
put
her
embroidered
handkerchief
to
dry
eyes
graham
looked
distressed
and
her
husband
wiped
his
spectacles
but
the
mist
was
in
his
eyes
and
presently
large
drops
fell
over
his
cheeks
as
he
looked
at
the
face
and
form
of
his
only
child
cornelia
saw
his
emotion
the
great
floodgate
of
her
heart
seemed
suddenly
lifted
she
passed
her
white
fingers
over
his
gray
hair
and
murmured
brokenly
my
father
my
father
i
have
been
a
care
and
a
sorrow
to
you
all
my
life
i
am
very
wayward
and
exacting
but
bear
with
your
poor
child
my
days
are
numbered
father
when
my
proud
head
lies
low
in
the
silent
grave
then
give
others
my
place
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
hollow
cheek
saying
tenderly
my
darling
you
break
my
heart
have
you
ever
been
denied
a
wish
what
is
there
that
i
can
do
to
make
you
happy
give
eugene
a
house
of
his
own
and
let
me
be
at
peace
in
my
home
will
you
do
this
for
me
yes
thank
you
my
father
disengaging
his
clasping
arm
she
left
them
a
few
days
after
the
party
at
her
house
asbury
returned
home
from
a
visit
to
the
asylum
of
which
she
had
recently
been
elected
a
manager
in
passing
the
parlor
door
she
heard
suppressed
voices
looked
in
and
perceiving
vincent
seated
near
georgia
retired
without
speaking
to
her
own
room
securing
the
door
she
sank
on
her
knees
and
besought
an
god
to
direct
and
aid
her
in
her
course
of
duty
the
time
had
arrived
when
she
must
hazard
everything
to
save
her
child
from
an
marriage
and
though
the
mother
heart
bled
she
was
firm
in
her
resolve
when
vincent
took
leave
and
georgia
had
returned
to
her
room
asbury
sought
her
she
found
her
moody
and
disposed
to
evade
her
questions
passing
her
arm
round
her
she
said
very
gently
my
dear
child
let
there
be
perfect
confidence
between
us
am
i
not
more
interested
in
your
happiness
than
anyone
else
my
child
what
has
estranged
you
of
late
georgia
made
no
reply
what
but
my
love
for
you
and
anxiety
for
your
happiness
could
induce
me
to
object
to
your
receiving
vincent
attentions
you
are
prejudiced
against
him
and
always
were
i
judge
the
young
man
only
from
his
conduct
you
know
you
are
obliged
to
know
that
he
is
recklessly
dissipated
selfish
and
immoral
he
is
no
worse
than
other
young
men
i
know
very
few
who
are
not
quite
as
wild
as
he
is
beside
he
has
promised
to
sign
the
temperance
pledge
if
i
will
marry
him
my
child
you
pain
me
beyond
expression
does
the
depravity
which
prevails
here
sanction
vincent
dissipation
oh
georgia
has
association
deprived
you
of
horror
of
vice
can
you
be
satisfied
because
others
are
quite
as
degraded
he
does
not
mean
what
he
promises
it
is
merely
to
deceive
you
his
intemperate
habits
are
too
confirmed
to
be
remedied
now
he
began
early
at
college
and
has
constantly
grown
worse
you
are
prejudiced
persisted
georgia
unable
to
restrain
her
tears
if
i
am
it
is
because
of
his
profligacy
can
you
possibly
be
attached
to
such
a
man
georgia
sobbed
and
cried
heartily
her
good
sense
told
her
that
her
mother
was
right
but
it
was
difficult
to
relinquish
the
hope
of
reforming
him
as
gently
as
possible
asbury
dwelt
upon
his
utter
worthlessness
and
the
misery
and
wretchedness
which
would
surely
ensue
from
such
a
union
with
streaming
eyes
she
implored
her
to
banish
the
thought
assuring
her
she
would
sooner
see
her
in
her
grave
than
the
wife
of
a
drunkard
and
now
the
care
of
years
was
to
be
rewarded
her
firm
but
gentle
reasoning
prevailed
georgia
had
always
reverenced
her
mother
she
knew
she
was
invariably
guided
by
principle
and
now
as
she
listened
to
her
earnest
entreaties
all
her
obstinacy
melted
away
throwing
herself
into
her
mother
arms
she
begged
her
to
forgive
the
pain
and
anxiety
she
had
caused
her
asbury
pressed
her
to
her
heart
and
silently
thanked

for
the

remonstrances

knew
nothing
when
vincent
called
the
following
day
georgia
very
decidedly
rejected
him
understanding
from
her
manner
that
she
meant
what
she
said
he
became
violently
enraged
swore
with
a
solemn
oath
that
he
would
make
her
repent
her
trifling
took
his
hat
and
left
the
house
this
sufficed
to
remove
any
lingering
tenderness
from
georgia
heart
and

chapter
xxvi
pauline
wedding
day
dawned
clear
and
bright
meet
for
the
happy
event
it
was
to
chronicle
the
ceremony
was
to
be
performed
in
church
at
an
early
hour
to
enable
the
newly
married
pair
to
leave
on
the
morning
boat
and
the
building
was
crowded
with
the
numerous
friends
assembled
to
witness
the
rites
the
minister
stood
within
the
altar
and
after
some
slight
delay
mortimor
led
pauline
down
the
aisle
hartwell
and
lockhart
stood
near
the
altar
lockhart
indisposition
prevented
his
attendance
satin
blond
and
diamonds
were
discarded
pauline
was
dressed
in
a
gray
traveling
habit
and
wore
a
plain
drab
traveling
bonnet
it
was
a
holy
a
touching
bridal
the
morning
sunshine
stealing
through
the
lofty
arched
windows
fell
on
her
pure
brow
with
dazzling
radiance
and
lent
many
a
golden
wave
to
the
silky
clustering
curls
pauline
was
marvelously
beautiful
the
violet
eyes
were
dewy
with
emotion
and
her
ripe
coral
lips
wreathed
with
a
smile
of
trembling
joyousness
perchance
a
cursory
observer
might
have
fancied
mortimor
countenance
too
grave
and
thoughtful
for
such
an
occasion
but
though
the
mouth
was
at
rest
and
the
dark
earnest
eyes
sparkled
not
there
was
a
light
of
grateful
chastened
gladness
shed
over
the
quiet
features
only
a
few
words
were
uttered
by
the
clergyman
and
pauline
the
wild
wayward
careless
spirited
girl
stood
there
a
wife
she
grew
deadly
pale
and
looked
up
with
a
feeling
of
awe
to
him
who
was
now
for
all
time
the
master
of
her
destiny
the
vows
yet
upon
her
lips
bound
her
irrevocably
to
his
side
and
imposed
on
her
as
a
solemn
duty
the
necessity
of
bearing
all
trials
for
herself
of
smoothing
away
home
cares
from
his
path
and
when
her
own
heart
was
troubled
of
putting
by
the
sorrow
and
bitterness
and
ever
welcoming
his
coming
with
a
word
of
kindness
or
a
smile
of
joy
a
wife
she
must
be
brave
enough
to
wrestle
with
difficulties
for
herself
instead
of
wearying
him
with
all
the
tedious
details
of
domestic
trials
and
yet
turn
to
him
for
counsel
and
sympathy
in
matters
of
serious
import
no
longer
a
mere
girl
consulting
only
her
own
wishes
and
tastes
she
had
given
another
the
right
to
guide
and
control
her
and
now
realizing
for
the
first
time
the
importance
of
the
step
she
had
taken
she
trembled
in
anticipation
of
the
trouble
her
wayward
obstinate
will
would
cause
her
but
with
her
wonted
buoyant
spirit
she
turned
from
all
unpleasant
reflections
and
received
the
congratulations
of
her
friends
with
subdued
gayety
beulah
stood
at
some
distance
watching
the
april
face
checkered
with
smiles
and
tears
and
looking
with
prophetic
dread
into
the
future
she
saw
how
little
genuine
happiness
could
result
from
a
union
of
natures
so
entirely
uncongenial
to
her
the
nuptial
rites
were
more
awfully
solemn
than
those
of
death
for
how
infinitely
preferable
was
a
quiet
in
the
shadow
of
mourning
cedars
to
the
lifelong
agony
of
an
unhappy
union
she
looked
up
at
her
quondam
guardian
as
he
stood
grave
and
silent
regarding
his
niece
with
sadly
anxious
eyes
and
as
she
noted
the
stern
inflexibility
of
his
sculptured
mouth
she
thought
that
he
stood
there
a
marble
monument
recording
the
misery
of
an
marriage
but
it
was
schooltime
and
she
approached
to
say
as
the
bridal
pair
took
their
seats
in
the
carriage
pauline
seemed
much
troubled
at
bidding
her
adieu
she
wept
silently
a
minute
then
throwing
her
arms
around
neck
whispered
pleadingly
wo
you
go
back
to
uncle
guy
wo
you
let
him
adopt
you
do
please
see
how
grim
and
pale
he
looks
wo
you
no
he
has
ceased
to
care
about
my
welfare
he
is
not
distressed
about
me
i
assure
you
write
to
me
often
yes
i
will
and
in
vacation
ernest
says
you
are
to
come
up
and
spend
at
least
a
month
with
us
do
you
hear
the
carriage
was
whirled
away
and
beulah
walked
on
to
her
schoolroom
with
a
dim
foreboding
that
when
she
again
met
the
beautiful
girl
sunshine
might
be
banished
from
her
face
days
weeks
and
months
passed
by
how
systematic
industry
speeds
the
wheels
of
time
beulah
had
little
leisure
and
this
was
employed
with
the
most
rigid
economy
school
duties
occupied
her
until
late
in
the
day
then
she
gave
every
afternoon
a
couple
of
music
lessons
and
it
was
not
until
night
that
she
felt
herself
free
the
editor
of
the
magazine
found
that
her
articles
were
worth
remuneration
and
consequently
a
monthly
contribution
had
to
be
copied
and
sent
in
at
stated
intervals
thus
engaged
spring
glided
into
summer
and
once
more
a
june
sun
beamed
on
the
city
one
saturday
she
accompanied
clara
to
a
jewelry
store
to
make
some
trifling
purchase
and
saw
eugene
graham
leaning
over
the
counter
looking
at
some
sets
of
pearl
and
diamonds
he
did
not
perceive
her
immediately
and
she
had
an
opportunity
of
scanning
his
countenance
unobserved
her
lip
trembled
as
she
noticed
the
flushed
face
and
inflamed
eyes
and
saw
that
the
hand
which
held
a
bracelet
was
very
unsteady
he
looked
up
started
and
greeted
her
with
evident
embarrassment
she
waited
until
clara
had
completed
her
purchase
and
then
said
quietly
eugene
are
you
going
away
without
coming
to
see
me
why
no
i
had
intended
calling
yesterday
but
was
prevented
and
i
am
obliged
to
leave
this
afternoon
by
the
way
help
me
to
select
between
these
two
pearl
sets
i
suppose
you
can
imagine
their
destination
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
alluded
to
his
marriage
and
she
answered
with
an
arch
smile
oh
yes
i
dare
say
i
might
guess
very
accurately
it
would
not
require
yankee
ingenuity
she
examined
the
jewels
and
after
giving
an
opinion
as
to
their
superiority
turned
to
go
saying
i
want
to
see
you
a
few
moments
before
you
leave
the
city
i
am
going
home
immediately
and
any
time
during
the
day
when
you
can
call
will
answer
he
looked
curious
glanced
at
his
watch
pondered
an
instant
and
promised
to
call
in
an
hour
she
bowed
and
returned
home
with
an
almost
intolerable
weight
on
her
heart
she
sat
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
collecting
her
thoughts
and
when
summoned
to
meet
eugene
went
down
with
a
firm
heart
but
trembling
frame
it
was
more
than
probable
that
she
would
be
misconstrued
and
wounded
but
she
determined
to
hazard
all
knowing
how
pure
were
the
motives
that
actuated
her
he
seemed
restless
and
ill
at
ease
yet
curious
withal
and
after
some
trifling
commonplace
remarks
beulah
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
beside
him
and
said
eugene
why
have
you
shunned
me
so
pertinaciously
since
your
return
from
europe
i
have
not
shunned
you
beulah
you
are
mistaken
i
have
been
engaged
and
therefore
could
visit
but
little
do
not
imagine
that
any
such
excuses
blind
me
to
the
truth
said
she
with
an
impatient
gesture
what
do
you
mean
he
answered
unable
to
bear
the
earnest
troubled
look
of
the
searching
eyes
oh
eugene
be
honest
be
honest
say
at
once
you
shunned
me
lest
i
should
mark
your
altered
habits
in
your
altered
face
but
i
know
it
all
notwithstanding
it
is
no
secret
that
eugene
graham
has
more
than
once
lent
his
presence
to
midnight
carousals
over
the
once
you
were
an
example
of
temperance
and
rectitude
but
vice
is
fashionable
and
patronized
in
this
city
and
your
associates
soon
dragged
you
down
from
your
proud
height
to
their
degraded
level
the
circle
in
which
you
move
were
not
shocked
at
your
fall
ladies
accustomed
to
hear
of
drunken
revels
ceased
to
attach
disgrace
to
them
and
you
were
welcomed
and
smiled
upon
as
though
you
were
all
a
man
should
be
oh
eugene
i
understand
why
you
have
carefully
shunned
one
who
has
an
unconquerable
horror
of
that
degradation
into
which
you
have
fallen
i
am
your
friend
your
best
and
most
disinterested
friend
what
do
your
fashionable
acquaintances
care
that
your
moral
character
is
impugned
and
your
fair
name
tarnished
your
dissipation
keeps
their
brothers
and
lovers
in
countenance
your
once
noble
unsullied
nature
would
shame
their
depravity
do
you
remember
one
bright
moonlight
night
about
six
years
ago
when
we
sat
in
williams
room
at
the
asylum
and
talked
of
our
future
then
with
a
soul
full
of
pure
aspirations
you
said
i
have
written
excelsior
on
my
banner
and
i
intend
like
that
noble
youth
to
press
forward
over
every
obstacle
mounting
at
every
step
until
i
too
stand
on
the
highest
pinnacle
and
plant
my
banner
where
its
glorious
motto
shall
float
over
the
world
ah
my
brother
that
banner
trails
in
the
dust
alpine
heights
tower
far
behind
you
dim
in
the
distance
and
now
with
another
motto
still
you
are
rushing
down
to
an
awful
gulf
oh
eugene
do
you
intend
to
go
on
to
utter
ruin
do
you
intend
to
wreck
happiness
health
and
character
in
the
sea
of
reckless
dissipation
do
you
intend
to
spend
your
days
in
disgusting
intoxication
i
would
you
had
a
mother
whose
prayers
might
save
you
or
a
father
whose
gray
hairs
you
dared
not
dishonor
or
a
sister
to
win
you
back
from
ruin
oh
that
you
and
i
had
never
never
left
the
sheltering
walls
of
the
asylum
she
wept
bitterly
and
more
moved
than
he
chose
to
appear
eugene
shaded
his
face
with
his
fingers
beulah
placed
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
continued
falteringly
eugene
i
am
not
afraid
to
tell
you
the
unvarnished
truth
you
may
get
angry
and
think
it
is
no
business
of
mine
to
counsel
you
who
are
older
and
master
of
your
own
fate
but
when
we
were
children
i
talked
to
you
freely
and
why
should
i
not
now
true
friendship
strengthens
with
years
and
shall
i
hesitate
to
speak
to
you
of
what
gives
me
so
much
pain
in
a
very
few
days
you
are
to
be
married
eugene
if
the
is
dearer
to
you
than
your
beautiful
bride
what
prospect
of
happiness
has
either
of
you
i
had
hoped
her
influence
would
deter
you
from
it
at
least
during
her
visit
here
but
if
not
then
how
can
her
presence
avail
in
future
oh
for
heaven
sake
for
antoinette
for
your
own
quit
the
ranks
of
ruin
you
are
in
and
come
back
to
temperance
and
honor
you
are
bowing
down
cornelia
proud
head
in
humiliation
and
sorrow
oh
eugene
have
mercy
on
yourself
he
tried
to
look
haughty
and
insulted
but
it
would
not
answer
her
pale
face
full
of
earnest
tearful
entreaty
touched
his
heart
not
altogether
indurated
by
profligate
associations
he
knew
she
had
not
given
an
exaggerated
account
he
had
imagined
that
she
would
not
hear
of
his
revels
but
certainly
she
told
only
the
truth
yet
he
resolved
not
to
admit
the
charge
and
shaking
off
her
hand
answered
proudly
if
i
am
the
degraded
character
you
flatteringly
pronounce
me
it
should
certainly
render
my
society
anything
but
agreeable
to
your
fastidious
taste
i
shall
not
soon
forget
your
unmerited
insults
he
rose
as
he
spoke
you
are
angry
now
eugene
because
i
have
held
up
your
own
portrait
for
your
inspection
you
are
piqued
because
i
tell
you
the
truth
but
when
all
this
has
subsided
and
you
think
the
matter
calmly
over
you
will
be
forced
to
acknowledge
that
only
the
purest
friendship
could
prompt
me
to
remonstrate
with
you
on
your
ruinous
career
of
course
if
you
choose
you
can
soon
wreck
yourself
you
are
your
own
master
but
the
infatuation
will
recoil
upon
you
your
disgrace
and
ruin
will
not
affect
me
save
that
as
your
friend
i
should
mourn
your
fall
ah
eugene
i
have
risked
your
displeasure
i
have
proved
my
friendship
he
took
his
hat
and
turned
toward
the
door
but
she
placed
herself
before
it
and
holding
out
both
hands
exclaimed
sorrowfully
do
not
let
us
part
in
anger
i
am
an
orphan
without
relatives
or
protectors
and
from
early
years
you
have
been
a
kind
brother
at
least
let
us
part
as
friends
i
know
that
in
future
we
shall
be
completely
alienated
but
your
friend
beulah
will
always
rejoice
to
hear
of
your
welfare
and
happiness
and
if
her
warning
words
kindly
meant
have
no
effect
and
she
hears
with
keen
regret
of
your
final
ruin
she
at
least
will
feel
that
she
honestly
and
anxiously
did
all
in
her
power
to
save
you
shake
hands
eugene
and
bear
with
you
to
the
altar
my
sincere
wishes
for
your
happiness
she
held
out
her
hands
entreatingly
but
he
took
no
notice
of
the
movement
and
hurrying
by
left
the
house
for
a
moment
beulah
bowed
her
head
and
sobbed
then
she
brushed
the
tears
from
her
cheek
and
the
black
brows
met
in
a
heavy
frown
true
she
had
not
expected
much
else
yet
she
felt
bitterly
grieved
and
it
was
many
months
are
she
ceased
to
remember
the
pain
of
this
interview
notwithstanding
the
contempt
she
could
not
avoid
feeling
for
his
weakness
the
grahams
all
accompanied
eugene
and
after
the
marriage
went
north
for
the
summer
a
handsome
house
was
erected
near
residence
and
in
the
fall
the
young
people
were
to
take
possession
of
it
lockhart
rallied
sufficiently
to
be
removed
to
his
home
up
the
country
and
save
asbury
family
beulah
saw
no
one
but
clara
and
her
pupils
with
july
came
the
close
of
the
session
and
the
young
teacher
was
free
again
one
afternoon
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
walked
to
a
distant
section
of
the
town
to
inquire
after
kate
ellison
one
of
her
assistant
teachers
who
she
happened
to
hear
was
quite
she
found
her
even
worse
than
she
had
expected
and
on
offering
her
services
to
watch
over
the
sick
girl
was
anxiously
requested
to
remain
with
her
during
the
night
she
dispatched
a
message
to
hoyt
cheerfully
laid
aside
her
bonnet
and
took
a
seat
near
the
sufferer
while
the
infirm
mother
retired
to
rest
the
family
were
very
poor
and
almost
entirely
dependent
on
kate
salary
for
a
support
the
house
was
small
arid
comfortless
the
scanty
furniture
of
the
plainest
kind
about
dusk
beulah
left
her
charge
in
a
sound
sleep
and
cautiously
opening
the
blinds
seated
herself
on
the
window
sill
the
solitary
candle
on
the
table
gave
but
a
dim
light
and
she
sat
for
a
long
time
looking
out
into
the
street
and
up
at
the
quiet
clear
sky
a
buggy
drew
up
beneath
the
window
she
supposed
it
was
the
family
physician
ellison
had
not
mentioned
his
coming
but
of
course
it
must
be
a
physician
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
she
straightened
one
or
two
chairs
picked
up
some
articles
of
clothing
scattered
about
the
floor
and
opened
the
door
she
knew
not
what
doctor
ellison
employed
and
as
her
guardian
entered
she
drew
back
with
a
start
of
surprise
she
had
not
seen
him
since
the
morning
of
pauline
marriage
five
months
before
and
then
he
had
not
noticed
her
now
he
stopped
suddenly
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
said
as
if
much
chagrined
what
are
you
doing
here
beulah
nursing
kate
sir
do
talk
so
loud
she
is
asleep
answered
beulah
rather
frigidly
she
did
not
look
at
him
but
knew
his
eyes
were
on
her
face
and
presently
he
said
you
are
always
where
you
ought
not
to
be
that
girl
has
typhus
fever
and
ten
to
one
you
will
take
it
in
the
name
of
common
sense
why
do
you
let
people
take
care
of
their
own
sick
and
stay
at
home
instead
of
hunting
up
cases
like
a
professed
nurse
i
suppose
the
first
confirmed
case
of
smallpox
you
hear
of
you
will
hasten
to
offer
your
services
you
do
intend
to
spend
the
night
here
it
is
to
be
hoped
her
mother
has
been
sitting
up
so
constantly
that
she
is
completely
exhausted
and
somebody
must
assist
in
nursing
kate
i
did
not
know
that
she
had
any
contagious
disease
but
if
she
has
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
run
the
risk
as
anybody
else
it
is
but
common
humanity
to
aid
the
family
oh
if
you
choose
to
risk
your
life
it
is
your
own
affair
do
not
imagine
for
an
instant
that
i
expected
my
advice
to
weigh
an
iota
with
you
he
walked
off
to
kate
felt
her
pulse
and
without
waking
her
proceeded
to
replenish
the
glass
of
medicine
on
the
table
beulah
was
in
no
mood
to
obtrude
herself
on
his
attention
she
went
to
the
window
and
stood
with
her
back
to
him
she
could
not
tamely
bear
his
taunting
manner
yet
felt
that
it
was
out
of
her
power
to
retort
for
she
still
reverenced
him
she
was
surprised
when
he
came
up
to
her
and
said
abruptly
i
read
an
article
in
magazine
called
the
life
by
a
deep
crimson
dyed
her
pale
face
an
instant
and
her
lips
curled
ominously
as
she
replied
in
a
indifferent
tone
well
sir
it
is
not
well
at
all
it
is
very
ill
it
is
most
miserable
well
what
do
i
care
for
the
article
in
magazine
these
words
were
jerked
out
as
it
were
with
something
like
a
sneer
you
care
more
than
you
will
ever
be
brought
to
confess
have
you
read
this
precious
life
oh
yes
have
you
any
idea
who
the
author
is
yes
sir
i
know
the
author
but
if
it
had
been
intended
or
desired
that
the
public
should
know
also
the
article
would
never
have
appeared
over
a
fictitious
signature
this
inner
life
which
she
had
written
for
the
last
number
of
the
magazine
was
an
allegory
in
which
she
boldly
attempted
to
disprove
the
truth
of
the
fact
tennyson
has
so
inimitably
embodied
in
the
palace
of
art
namely
that
love
of
beauty
and
intellectual
culture
can
not
satisfy
the
aspirations
of
the
soul
her
guardian
fully
comprehended
the
dawning
and
as
yet
unacknowledged
dread
which
prompted
this
article
and
hastily
laying
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
he
said
ah
proud
girl
you
are
struggling
desperately
with
your
heart
you
too
have
reared
a
on
dreary
almost
inaccessible
crags
and
because
already
you
begin
to
weary
of
your
isolation
you
would
fain
hurl
invectives
at
tennyson
who
explores
your
mansion
royal
rich
and
wide
and
discovers
the
grim
specters
that
dwell
with
you
you
were
very
miserable
when
you
wrote
that
sketch
you
are
not
equal
to
what
you
have
undertaken
child
this
year
of
trial
and
loneliness
has
left
its
impress
on
your
face
are
you
not
yet
willing
to
give
up
the
struggle
the
moon
had
risen
and
as
its
light
shone
on
her
countenance
he
saw
a
fierce
blaze
in
her
eyes
he
had
never
noticed
there
before
she
shook
off
his
light
touch
and
answered
no
i
will
never
give
up
he
smiled
and
left
her
she
remained
with
her
sick
friend
until
sunrise
the
next
morning
and
ere
she
left
the
house
was
rewarded
by
the
assurance
that
she
was
better
in
a
few
days
kate
was
decidedly
convalescent
beulah
did
not
take
typhus
fever
chapter
xxvii
the
day
was
sullen
stormy
and
dark
gray
leaden
clouds
were
scourged
through
the
sky
by
a
howling
southeastern
gale
and
the
lashed
waters
of
the
bay
broke
along
the
shore
with
a
solemn
continued
boom
the
rain
fell
drearily
and
sheet
lightning
pale
and
constant
gave
a
ghastly
hue
to
the
scudding
clouds
it
was
one
of
those
lengthened
storms
which
during
the
month
of
august
are
so
prevalent
along
the
gulf
coast
clara
sanders
sat
near
a
window
bending
over
a
piece
of
needlework
while
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
beulah
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
their
countenances
contrasted
vividly
clara
sweet
placid
face
with
drooped
eyelids
and
serenity
the
soft
auburn
hair
curled
about
her
cheeks
and
the
delicate
lips
in
peaceful
rest
and
beulah
how
shall
i
adequately
paint
the
gloom
and
restlessness
written
in
her
stormy
countenance
to
tell
you
that
her
brow
was
bent
and
lowering
that
her
lips
were
now
unsteady
and
now
tightly
compressed
and
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
troubled
shadows
would
convey
but
a
faint
impression
of
the
anxious
discontent
which
seemed
to
have
taken
entire
possession
of
her
clara
glanced
at
her
sighed
and
went
on
with
her
work
she
knew
perfectly
well
she
was
in
no
humor
for
conversation
the
rain
increased
until
it
fell
in
torrents
and
the
hoarse
thunder
muttered
a
dismal
accompaniment
it
grew
too
dark
to
see
the
stitches
clara
put
by
her
work
and
folding
her
hands
on
her
lap
sat
looking
out
into
the
storm
listening
to
the
roar
of
the
rushing
wind
as
it
bowed
the
treetops
and
uplifted
the
capped
billows
of
the
bay
beulah
paused
beside
the
window
and
said
abruptly
it
is
typical
of
the
individual
social
moral
and
intellectual
life
look
which
way
you
will
you
find
antagonistic
elements
fiercely
warring
there
is
a
broken
cog
somewhere
in
the
machinery
of
this
plunging
globe
of
ours
everything
organic
and
inorganic
bears
testimony
to
a
miserable
derangement
there
is
not
a
department
of
earth
where
harmony
reigns
true
the
stars
are
serene
and
move
in
their
everlasting
orbits
with
fixed
precision
but
they
are
not
of
earth
here
there
is
nothing
definite
nothing
certain
the
seasons
are
regular
but
they
are
determined
by
other
worlds
verily
the
contest
is
still
fiercely
waged
between
ormuzd
and
ahriman
and
the
last
has
the
best
of
it
so
far
the
three
thousand
years
of
ahriman
seem
dawning
she
resumed
her
walk
and
looking
after
her
anxiously
clara
answered
but
remember
the
promises
that
ormuzd
shall
finally
conquer
and
reign
supreme
in
this
happy
kingdom
i
love
to
trace
the
resemblance
to
the
millennium
which
was
shown
john
on
lonely
patmos
it
is
small
comfort
to
anticipate
a
time
of
blessedness
for
future
generations
what
benefit
is
steam
or
telegraph
to
the
moldering
mummies
of
the
catacombs
i
want
to
know
what
good
the
millennium
will
do
you
and
me
when
our
dust
is
mingled
with
mother
earth
in
some
silent
necropolis
oh
beulah
what
ails
you
you
look
so
gloomy
and
wretched
it
seems
to
me
you
have
changed
sadly
of
late
i
knew
that
a
life
of
labor
such
as
you
voluntarily
assumed
would
chasten
your
spirit
but
i
did
not
expect
this
utter
revolution
of
your
natura
so
soon
oh
have
done
with
skepticism
faith
in
creeds
is
not
to
be
put
on
and
laid
aside
at
will
like
a
garment
granted
that
these
same
doctrines
of
zoroaster
are
faint
adumbrations
of
the
hebrew
creed
the
gordian
knot
is
by
no
means
loosed
that
prologue
in
horrified
you
yesterday
yet
upon
my
word
i
do
see
why
for
very
evidently
it
is
taken
from
job
and
faust
is
but
an
ideal
job
tempted
in
more
subtle
manner
than
by
the
loss
of
flocks
houses
and
children
you
believe
that
satan
was
allowed
to
do
his
utmost
to
ruin
job
and
mephistopheles
certainly
set
out
on
the
same
fiendish
mission
mephistopheles
is
not
the
defiant
demon
of
milton
but
a
powerful
prince
in
the
service
of
god
you
need
not
shudder
i
am
giving
no
partial
account
i
merely
repeat
the
opinion
of
many
on
this
subject
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
evil
exists
that
is
the
grim
fact
as
to
its
origin
i
would
about
as
soon
set
off
to
search
for
the
city
asgard
still
i
would
not
give
my
faith
for
all
your
learning
and
philosophy
see
what
it
has
brought
you
to
answered
clara
sorrowfully
your
faith
what
does
it
teach
you
of
this
evil
principle
retorted
beulah
impatiently
at
least
more
than
all
speculation
has
taught
you
you
admit
that
of
its
origin
you
know
nothing
the
bible
tells
me
that
time
was
when
earth
was
sinless
and
man
holy
and
that
death
and
sin
entered
the
world
by
man
transgression
which
i
do
believe
interrupted
beulah
so
you
might
sit
there
and
stop
your
ears
and
close
your
eyes
and
assert
that
this
was
a
sunny
serene
day
your
reception
or
rejection
of
the
biblical
record
by
no
means
affects
its
authenticity
my
faith
teaches
that
the
evil
you
so
bitterly
deprecate
is
not
eternal
shall
finally
be
crushed
and
the
harmony
you
crave
pervade
all
realms
why
an
and
god
suffers
evil
to
exist
is
not
for
his
finite
creatures
to
determine
it
is
one
of
many
mysteries
which
it
is
as
utterly
useless
to
bother
over
as
to
weave
ropes
of
sand
she
gathered
up
her
sewing
materials
put
them
in
her
basket
and
retired
to
her
own
room
beulah
felt
relieved
when
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
taking
up
theodore
parker
discourses
began
to
read
poor
famishing
soul
what
chaff
she
eagerly
devoured
in
her
anxious
haste
she
paused
not
to
perceive
that
the
attempted
refutations
of
christianity
contained
objections
more
gross
and
incomprehensible
than
the
doctrine
assailed
long
before
she
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
ethical
and
theological
truth
must
be
firmly
established
on
psychological
foundations
hence
she
plunged
into
metaphysics
studying
treatise
after
treatise
and
system
after
system
to
her
grievous
disappointment
however
the
psychology
of
each
seemed
different
nay
opposed
she
set
out
believing
her
consciousness
the
infallible
criterion
of
truth
this
she
fancied
philosophy
taught
at
least
professed
to
teach
but
instead
of
unanimity
among
metaphysicians
she
found
fierce
denunciation
of
predecessors
ingenious
refutations
of
principles
which
they
had
evolved
from
rigid
analysis
of
the
facts
of
consciousness
and
an
intolerant
dogmatism
which
astonished
and
confused
her
one
extolled
locke
as
an
oracle
of
wisdom
another
ridiculed
the
shallowness
of
his
investigations
and
the
absurdity
of
his
doctrines
while
a
third
showed
conclusively
that
locke
assailant
knew
nothing
at
all
of
what
he
wrote
and
maintained
that
he
alone
could
set
matters
right
she
studied
locke
for
herself
either
he
was
right
and
all
the
others
were
wrong
or
else
there
was
no
truth
in
any
another
philosopher
professed
to
ground
some
points
of
his
faith
on
certain
principles
of
descartes
the
very
next
work
she
read
proclaimed
that
descartes
never
held
any
such
principles
that
the
writer
had
altogether
mistaken
his
views
whereupon
up
started
another
who
informed
her
that
nobody
knew
what
descartes
really
did
believe
on
the
subject
under
discussion
that
it
was
a
mooted
question
among
his
disciples
this
was
rather
discouraging
but
nothing
daunted
she
bought
borrowed
and
read
on
brown
descent
upon
reid
greatly
interested
her
true
there
were
very
many
things
she
could
not
assent
to
yet
the
arguments
seemed
plausible
enough
when
lo
a
metaphysical
giant
rescues
reid
tells
her
that
brown
was
an
ignoramus
utterly
misunderstood
the
theory
he
set
himself
to
criticise
and
was
a
wretched
bungler
after
which
he
proceeds
to
show
that
although
brown
had
not
acumen
enough
to
perceive
it
reid
had
himself
fallen
into
grave
errors
and
culpable
obscurity
who
was
right
or
who
was
wrong
she
could
not
for
her
life
decide
it
would
have
been
farcical
indeed
had
she
not
been
so
anxiously
in
earnest
beginning
to
distrust
herself
and
with
a
dawning
dread
lest
after
all
psychology
would
prove
an
incompetent
guide
she
put
by
the
philosophies
themselves
and
betook
herself
to
histories
of
philosophy
fancying
that
here
all
bitter
invective
would
be
laid
aside
and
stern
impartiality
prevail
here
the
evil
she
fled
from
increased
fourfold
one
historian
of
philosophy
who
was
a
great
favorite
of
her
guardian
having
lost
all
confidence
in
the
subjects
he
treated
set
himself
to
work
to
show
the
fallacy
of
all
systems
from
anaximander
to
cousin
she
found
the
historians
of
philosophy
as
much
at
variance
as
the
philosophers
themselves
and
looked
with
dismay
into
the
dim
land
of
vagaries
into
which
metaphysics
had
drawn
the
brightest
minds
of
the
past
then
her
guardian
favorite
quotation
recurred
to
her
with
painful
significance
there
is
no
criterion
of
truth
all
is
merely
subjective
truth
it
was
the
old
skeptical
palladium
ancient
as
metaphysics
she
began
to
despair
of
the
truth
in
this
direction
but
it
certainly
existed
somewhere
she
commenced
the
study
of
cousin
with
trembling
eagerness
if
at
all
she
would
surely
find
in
a
harmonious
eclecticism
the
absolute
truth
she
has
chased
through
so
many
metaphysical
doublings
eclecticism
would
cull
for
her
the
results
of
all
search
and
reasoning
for
a
time
she
believed
she
had
indeed
found
a
his
true
satisfied
her
his
beautiful
fascinated
her
but
when
she
came
to
examine
his
theodieea
and
trace
its
results
she
shrank
back
appalled
she
was
not
yet
prepared
to
embrace
his
subtle
pantheism
thus
far
had
her
sincere
inquiries
and
efforts
brought
her
it
was
no
wonder
her
hopeful
nature
grew
bitter
and
cynical
no
wonder
her
brow
was
bent
with
puzzled
thought
and
her
pale
face
haggard
and
joyless
sick
of
systems
she
began
to
search
her
own
soul
did
the
very
thing
of
all
others
best
calculated
to
harass
her
mind
and
fill
it
with
inexplicable
mysteries
she
constituted
her
own
reason
the
sole
judge
and
then
dubious
of
the
verdict
arraigned
reason
itself
before
itself
now
began
the
desperate
struggle
alone
and
unaided
she
wrestled
with
some
of
the
grimmest
doubts
that
can
assail
a
human
soul
the
very
prevalence
of
her
own
doubts
augmented
the
difficulty
on
every
side
she
saw
the
footprints
of
skepticism
in
history
essays
novels
poems
and
reviews
still
her
indomitable
will
maintained
the
conflict
her
hopes
aims
energies
all
centered
in
this
momentous
struggle
she
studied
over
these
problems
until
her
eyes
grew
dim
and
the
veins
on
her
brow
swelled
like
cords
often
gray
dawn
looked
in
upon
her
still
sitting
before
her
desk
with
a
sickly
waning
lamplight
gleaming
over
her
pallid
face
and
as
she
looked
out
on
the
flying
clouds
and
listened
to
the
mournful
wail
of
the
rushing
gale
she
seemed
to
stand
upon
the
verge
of
a
yawning
chaos
what
did
she
believe
she
knew
not
old
faiths
had
crumbled
away
she
stood
in
a
dreary
waste
strewn
with
the
wreck
of
creeds
and
systems
a
silent
desolation
and
with
richter
christ
she
exclaimed
oh
how
is
each
so
solitary
in
this
wide
grave
of
the
all
i
am
alone
with
myself
oh
father
oh
father
where
is
thy
infinite
bosom
that
i
might
rest
on
it
a
belief
in
something
she
must
have
it
was
an
absolute
necessity
of
the
soul
there
was
no
scoffing
tendency
in
her
skepticism
she
could
not
jest
over
the
solemn
issues
involved
and
stood
wondering
which
way
she
should
next
journey
after
this
pearl
of
great
price
it
was
well
for
her
that
garlands
of
rhetoric
and
glittering
logic
lay
over
the
pitfalls
before
her
for
there
were
unsounded
abysses
darker
than
any
she
had
yet
endeavored
to
fathom
clara
came
back
and
softly
laid
her
hand
on
her
friend
arm
please
put
up
your
book
and
sing
something
for
me
wo
you
beulah
looked
at
the
serene
countenance
so
full
of
resignation
and
answered
gloomily
what
are
you
too
tired
of
listening
to
this
nature
has
treated
us
to
for
the
last
two
days
it
seems
to
me
the
very
universe
animate
and
inanimate
is
indulging
in
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
the
one
would
almost
think
the
was
being
played
up
and
down
the
aisles
of
creation
she
pressed
her
hands
to
her
hot
brow
as
if
to
wipe
away
the
cobwebs
that
dimmed
her
vision
and
raising
the
lid
of
the
piano
ran
her
fingers
over
the
keys
sing
me
something
hopeful
and
said
clara
i
have
no
songs
of
that
description
yes
you
have
aloft
and
the
of
life
no
no
impossible
i
could
not
sing
either
now
replied
beulah
averting
her
face
why
not
now
they
are
the
excelsior
strains
of
struggling
pilgrims
they
were
written
for
the
dark
hours
of
life
they
are
a
mockery
to
me
ask
me
for
anything
else
said
she
compressing
her
lips
clara
leaned
her
arm
on
the
piano
and
looking
sadly
at
her
companion
said
as
if
with
a
painful
effort
beulah
in
a
little
while
we
shall
be
separated
and
only
the
father
knows
whether
we
shall
meet
on
earth
again
my
application
for
that
situation
as
governess
up
the
country
brought
me
an
answer
i
am
to
go
very
soon
beulah
made
no
reply
and
clara
continued
sorrowfully
it
is
very
painful
to
leave
my
few
remaining
friends
and
go
among
perfect
strangers
but
it
is
best
that
i
should
she
leaned
her
head
on
her
hand
and
wept
why
is
it
best
because
here
i
am
constantly
reminded
of
other
days
and
other
hopes
now
lying
dead
on
my
heart
but
we
will
not
speak
of
this
of
all
my
ties
here
my
love
for
you
is
now
the
strongest
oh
beulah
our
friendship
has
been
sacred
and
i
dread
the
loneliness
which
will
be
my
portion
when
hundreds
of
miles
lie
between
us
the
links
that
bind
orphan
hearts
like
ours
are
more
lasting
than
all
others
i
shall
be
left
entirely
alone
if
you
accept
this
situation
you
have
long
been
my
only
companion
do
leave
me
clara
murmured
beulah
while
her
lips
writhed
and
quivered
you
will
have
the
asburys
still
and
they
are
sincere
friends
yes
friends
but
not
companions
what
congeniality
is
there
between
those
girls
and
myself
none
my
isolation
will
be
complete
when
you
leave
me
beulah
will
you
let
me
say
what
is
in
my
heart
say
it
freely
my
darling
well
then
beulah
give
it
up
give
it
up
it
will
only
bow
down
your
heart
with
untold
cares
and
sorrows
give
up
what
this
combat
with
loneliness
and
poverty
i
am
not
lonely
answered
beulah
with
a
wintry
smile
oh
beulah
yes
you
are
wretchedly
lonely
i
have
been
but
a
poor
companion
for
you
intellectually
you
are
far
beyond
me
and
there
has
been
little
congeniality
in
our
tastes
and
pursuits
i
have
always
known
this
and
i
know
too
that
you
never
will
be
a
happy
woman
until
you
have
a
companion
equal
in
intellect
who
understands
and
sympathizes
with
you
ah
beulah
with
all
your
stubborn
pride
and
will
and
mental
endowments
you
have
a
woman
heart
and
crush
its
impulses
as
you
may
it
will
yet
assert
its
sway
as
i
told
you
long
ago
grammars
and
geographies
and
duty
could
not
fill
the
void
in
my
heart
and
believe
me
neither
will
metaphysics
and
philosophy
and
literature
satisfy
you
suppose
you
do
attain
celebrity
as
a
writer
can
the
plaudits
of
strangers
bring
back
to
your
solitary
hearth
the
loved
dead
or
cheer
you
in
your
hours
of
gloom
i
too
am
an
orphan
i
speak
of
what
i
can
appreciate
you
are
mistaken
beulah
in
thinking
you
can
dispense
with
sympathy
you
are
not
sufficient
for
yourself
as
you
have
so
proudly
maintained
god
has
created
us
for
companionship
it
is
a
necessity
of
human
nature
then
why
are
you
and
i
orphaned
for
all
time
asked
beulah
coldly
the
sablest
clouds
of
sorrow
have
silver
linings
perhaps
that
you
and
i
might
turn
more
continually
to
the
god
of
orphans
beulah
god
has
not
flooded
earth
with
eternal
sunlight
he
knew
that
shadows
were
needed
to
chasten
the
spirits
of
his
children
and
teach
them
to
look
to
him
for
the
renewal
of
all
blessings
but
shadows
are
fleeting
and
every
season
of
gloom
has
its
morning
star
oh
i
thank
god
that
his
own
hand
arranged
the
chiaroscuro
of
earth
she
spoke
earnestly
the
expression
of
her
eyes
told
that
her
thoughts
had
traveled
into
the
dim
weird
land
of
futurity
beulah
offered
no
comment
but
the
gloom
deepened
on
her
brow
and
her
white
fingers
crept
restlessly
over
the
piano
keys
after
a
moment
silence
clara
continued
i
would
not
regret
our
separation
so
much
if
i
left
you
in
the
possession
of
christian
faith
armed
with
a
perfect
trust
in
the
religion
of
jesus
christ
oh
beulah
it
makes
my
heart
ache
when
i
think
of
you
struggling
so
fiercely
in
the
grasp
of
infidelity
many
times
have
i
seen
the
light
shining
beneath
your
door
long
after
midnight
and
wept
over
the
conflict
in
which
i
knew
you
were
engaged
and
only
god
knows
how
often
i
have
mingled
your
name
in
my
prayers
entreating
him
to
direct
you
in
your
search
to
guide
you
safely
through
the
paths
of
skepticism
and
place
your
weary
feet
upon
the
of
ages
oh
beulah
do
not
make
my
prayers
vain
by
your
continued
questioning
come
back
to
christ
and
the
bible
tears
glided
down
her
cheeks
as
she
passed
her
arm
round
her
friend
and
dropped
her
head
on
her
shoulder
beulah
eyelids
trembled
an
instant
but
there
was
no
moisture
in
the
gray
depths
as
she
answered
thank
you
clara
for
your
interest
i
am
glad
you
have
this
faith
you
would
fain
lead
me
to
not
for
worlds
would
i
unsettle
it
even
if
i
could
you
are
comforted
in
your
religion
and
it
is
a
priceless
blessing
to
you
but
i
am
sincere
even
in
my
skepticism
i
am
honest
and
god
if
he
sees
my
heart
sees
that
i
am
i
may
be
an
infidel
as
you
call
me
but
if
so
i
am
an
honest
one
and
if
the
bible
is
all
true
as
you
believe
god
will
judge
my
heart
but
i
shall
not
always
be
skeptical
i
shall
find
the
truth
yet
i
know
it
is
a
tedious
journey
i
have
set
out
on
and
it
may
be
my
life
will
be
spent
in
the
search
but
what
of
that
if
at
last
i
attain
the
goal
what
if
i
only
live
to
reach
it
what
will
my
life
be
to
me
without
it
and
can
you
contentedly
contemplate
your
future
passed
as
this
last
year
has
been
cried
clara
perhaps
is
scarcely
the
right
term
i
shall
not
murmur
no
matter
how
dreary
the
circumstances
of
my
life
may
be
provided
i
succeed
at
last
replied
beulah
resolutely
oh
beulah
you
make
my
heart
ache
then
try
not
to
think
of
or
care
for
me
there
is
another
heart
dear
beulah
a
heart
sad
but
noble
that
you
are
causing
bitter
anguish
are
you
utterly
indifferent
to
this
also
all
of
the
last
exists
merely
in
your
imagination
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
if
you
please
she
immediately
began
a
brilliant
overture
and
clara
retreated
to
the
window
with
night
the
roar
of
the
tempest
increased
the
rain
fell
with
a
dull
uninterrupted
patter
the
gale
swept
furiously
on
and
the
heaving
foaming
waters
of
the
bay
gleamed
luridly
beneath
the
clara
stood
looking
out
and
before
long
beulah
joined
her
then
the
former
said
suddenly
do
you
remember
that
about
six
years
ago
a
storm
like
this
tossed
the
star
far
from
its
destined
track
and
for
many
days
it
was
unheard
of
do
you
remember
too
that
it
held
one
you
loved
and
that
in
an
agony
of
dread
lest
he
should
find
a
grave
among
coral
beds
you
bowed
your
knee
in
prayer
to
almighty
god
imploring
him
to
calm
the
tempest
hush
the
gale
and
save
him
who
was
so
dear
to
you
ah
beulah
you
distrusted
human
pilots
then
as
beulah
made
no
reply
she
fancied
she
was
pondering
her
words
but
memory
had
flown
back
to
the
hour
when
she
knelt
in
prayer
for
eugene
and
she
thought
she
could
far
better
have
borne
his
death
then
in
the
glorious
springtime
of
his
youth
than
know
that
he
had
fallen
from
his
noble
height
then
she
could
have
mourned
his
loss
and
cherished
his
memory
ever
after
now
she
could
only
pity
and
despise
his
folly
what
was
that
early
shipwreck
she
so
much
dreaded
in
comparison
with
the
sea
of
vice
whose
every
wave
tossed
him
helplessly
on
to
ruin
he
had
left
her
an
earnest
believer
in
religion
he
came
back
scoffing
at
everything
sacred
this
much
she
had
learned
from
cornelia
was
there
an
intimate
connection
between
the
revolutions
in
his
nature
misled
by
her
silence
clara
said
eagerly
you
were
happy
in
that
early
faith
oh
beulah
you
will
never
find
another
so
holy
so
comforting
beulah
frowned
and
looked
up
impatiently
clara
i
am
not
to
be
persuaded
into
anything
leave
me
to
myself
you
are
kind
but
mistaken
if
i
have
said
too
much
forgive
me
i
was
actuated
by
sincere
affection
and
pity
for
your
state
of
mind
i
am
not
an
object
of
pity
by
any
means
replied
beulah
very
coldly
clara
was
unfortunate
in
her
expressions
she
seemed
to
think
so
and
turned
away
but
conscious
of
having
spoken
hastily
beulah
caught
her
hand
and
exclaimed
frankly
do
not
be
hurt
with
me
i
did
not
intend
to
wound
you
forgive
me
clara
do
go
when
are
you
to
leave
for
your
new
home
day
after
arlington
seems
anxious
that
i
should
come
immediately
he
has
three
children
a
son
and
two
daughters
i
hope
they
are
amiable
i
dread
lest
they
prove
unruly
and
spoiled
if
so
woe
to
their
governess
does
arlington
reside
in
the
village
to
which
you
directed
your
letter
no
he
resides
on
his
plantation
several
miles
from
the
village
the
prospect
of
being
in
the
country
is
the
only
redeeming
feature
in
the
arrangement
i
hope
my
health
will
be
permanently
restored
by
the
change
but
of
the
success
of
my
plan
only
time
can
decide
and
when
shall
we
meet
again
said
beulah
slowly
perhaps
henceforth
our
paths
diverge
widely
we
may
meet
no
more
on
earth
but
dear
beulah
there
is
a
shore
where
billows
never
beat
nor
tempests
roar
where
assuredly
we
shall
spend
an
eternity
together
if
we
keep
the
faith
here
oh
if
i
thought
our
parting
now
was
for
all
time
i
should
mourn
bitterly
very
bitterly
but
i
will
not
believe
it
the
arms
of
our
god
support
you
i
shall
always
pray
that
he
will
guide
and
save
you
she
leaned
forward
kissed
beulah
forehead
and
left
the
room
chapter
xxviii
one
afternoon
in
october
the
indisposition
of
one
of
her
music
pupils
released
beulah
earlier
than
usual
and
she
determined
to
seize
this
opportunity
and
visit
the
asylum
of
the
walk
across
the
common
she
never
wearied
the
grass
had
grown
brown
and
save
the
deep
changeless
green
of
the
ancient
pines
only
the
hectic
coloring
of
the
dying
year
met
her
eye
the
day
was
cool
and
windy
and
the
common
presented
a
scene
of
boisterous
confusion
which
she
paused
to
contemplate
a
number
of
boys
had
collected
to
play
their
favorite
games
balls
flew
in
every
direction
and
merry
shouts
rang
cheerily
through
the
air
she
looked
on
a
few
moments
at
their
careless
happy
sports
and
resumed
her
walk
feeling
that
their
joyousness
was
certainly
contagious
she
was
so
much
from
having
watched
their
beaming
faces
and
listened
to
their
ringing
laughter
as
she
drew
near
the
asylum
gate
memory
began
to
pass
its
fingers
over
her
heart
but
here
too
sounds
of
gladness
met
her
the
orphans
were
assembled
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
building
chatting
as
cheerfully
as
though
they
were
all
members
of
one
family
the
little
ones
trundled
hoops
and
chased
each
other
up
and
down
the
graveled
walks
some
of
the
boys
tossed
their
balls
and
a
few
of
the
larger
girls
were
tying
up
chrysanthemums
to
slender
stakes
they
were
dressed
alike
all
looked
contented
neat
and
happy
and
their
rosy
faces
presented
a
noble
tribute
to
the
efficacy
and
untold
blessings
of
the
institution
to
many
of
them
beulah
was
well
known
she
threw
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
and
assisted
the
girls
in
their
work
among
the
flowers
while
the
little
ones
gathered
around
her
lisping
their
childish
welcome
and
coaxing
her
to
join
in
their
innocent
games
the
stately
china
trees
where
in
years
gone
by
lilly
and
claudy
had
watched
the
chirping
robins
were
again
clad
in
their
rich
golden
livery
and
as
beulah
looked
up
at
the
red
brick
walls
that
had
sheltered
her
head
in
the
early
days
of
orphanage
it
seemed
but
yesterday
that
she
trod
these
walks
and
listened
to
the
wintry
wind
sighing
through
these
same
loved
trees
the
children
told
her
that
their
matron
had
been
sick
and
was
not
yet
quite
well
and
needing
no
pilot
beulah
went
through
the
house
in
search
of
her
she
found
her
at
last
in
the
storeroom
giving
out
materials
for
the
evening
meal
and
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
the
last
few
months
she
was
pale
and
thin
and
her
sharpened
features
wore
a
depressed
weary
expression
but
turning
round
she
perceived
beulah
and
a
glad
smile
broke
instantly
over
her
countenance
as
she
clasped
the
girl
hand
in
both
hers
dear
child
i
have
looked
for
you
a
long
time
i
did
not
think
you
would
wait
so
many
weeks
come
in
and
sit
down
i
did
not
know
you
had
been
sick
until
i
came
and
heard
the
children
speak
of
it
you
should
have
sent
met
word
i
see
you
have
not
entirely
recovered
no
i
am
quite
feeble
yet
but
in
time
i
hope
i
shall
be
well
again
ah
beulah
i
have
wanted
to
see
you
so
much
so
much
child
it
seems
to
me
i
shall
never
get
used
to
being
separated
from
you
beulah
sat
on
the
sofa
near
her
and
the
matron
withered
hands
were
passed
caressingly
over
the
glossy
bands
of
hair
which
lay
on
the
orphan
white
temples
i
love
to
come
here
occasionally
it
does
me
good
but
not
too
often
that
would
be
painful
you
know
beulah
spoke
in
a
subdned
voice
while
memory
painted
the
evening
when
eugene
had
sought
her
in
this
apartment
and
wiped
away
her
tears
for
lilly
absence
her
features
twitched
as
she
thought
of
the
bitter
changes
that
rolling
years
work
and
she
sighed
unconsciously
the
matron
hands
were
still
smoothing
her
hair
and
presently
she
said
with
an
anxious
scrutinizing
look
have
you
been
sick
since
you
were
here
last
no
what
makes
you
imagine
such
a
thing
dear
child
i
do
not
imagine
i
know
you
look
worn
and
why
beulah
hold
up
your
hand
there
see
how
transparent
it
is
almost
like
wax
something
ails
you
child
that
i
know
well
enough
no
i
assure
you
i
am
not
ill
sometimes
of
late
i
have
been
troubled
with
the
old
headaches
you
used
to
cure
when
i
was
a
child
but
on
the
whole
i
am
well
beulah
they
tell
me
eugene
is
married
said
the
woman
with
another
look
at
the
quiet
face
beside
her
yes
he
was
married
nearly
five
months
ago
a
tremor
passed
over
her
lips
as
she
spoke
did
you
see
his
wife
yes
she
is
a
very
pretty
woman
i
may
say
a
beautiful
woman
but
she
does
not
suit
him
at
least
i
am
afraid
she
will
not
ah
i
knew
as
much
i
thought
as
much
cried
williams
why
asked
beulah
wonderingly
oh
money
cloaks
all
faults
child
i
knew
he
did
not
marry
her
for
love
beulah
started
a
little
and
said
hastily
you
do
him
injustice
great
injustice
eugene
was
charmed
by
her
beauty
not
her
fortune
oh
heiresses
are
always
beautiful
and
charming
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
beulah
do
you
know
that
i
watched
for
eugene
for
days
and
weeks
and
months
after
his
return
from
europe
i
wanted
to
see
so
much
i
loved
you
both
as
though
you
were
my
own
children
i
was
so
proud
of
that
boy
i
had
raised
him
from
a
crawling
infant
and
never
dreamed
that
he
would
forget
me
but
he
did
not
come
i
have
not
seen
him
since
he
left
six
years
ago
for
germany
oh
the
boy
has
pained
me
pained
me
i
loved
him
so
much
beulah
brow
clouded
heavily
as
she
said
it
is
better
so
better
that
you
should
not
see
him
he
is
not
what
he
was
when
he
quitted
us
is
it
true
then
that
he
drinks
that
he
is
wild
and
dissipated
i
heard
it
once
but
would
not
believe
it
oh
it
ca
be
that
eugene
drinks
yes
he
drinks
not
to
stupid
intoxication
but
too
freely
for
his
health
and
character
he
does
not
look
like
himself
now
williams
bowed
down
her
head
and
wept
bitterly
while
beulah
continued
sorrowfully
his
adoption
was
his
ruin
had
he
remained
dependent
on
his
individual
exertions
he
would
have
grown
up
an
honor
to
himself
and
his
friends
but
graham
is
considered
very
wealthy
and
eugene
weakly
desisted
from
the
honest
labor
which
was
his
duty
his
fashionable
associates
have
ruined
him
in
europe
he
learned
to
drink
and
here
his
companions
dragged
him
constantly
into
scenes
of
dissipation
but
i
do
not
despair
of
him
yet
it
may
be
long
before
he
awakens
from
this
infatuation
but
i
trust
he
will
yet
reform
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
him
as
a
confirmed
drunkard
oh
no
no
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
still
hope
that
his
nobler
nature
will
conquer
god
help
the
boy
i
have
prayed
for
him
for
years
and
i
shall
pray
for
him
still
though
he
has
forgotten
me
she
sobbed
and
covered
her
face
with
her
apron
a
joyless
smile
flitted
over
beulah
fixed
grave
features
as
she
said
encouragingly
he
will
come
to
see
you
when
he
returns
from
the
north
he
has
not
forgotten
you
that
is
impossible
like
me
he
owes
you
too
much
i
shall
leave
here
very
soon
said
williams
wiping
her
eyes
leave
the
asylum
for
what
i
am
getting
old
child
and
my
health
is
none
of
the
best
the
duties
are
very
heavy
here
and
i
am
not
willing
to
occupy
the
position
unless
i
could
discharge
all
the
duties
faithfully
i
have
sent
in
my
resignation
to
the
managers
and
as
soon
as
they
succeed
in
getting
another
matron
i
shall
leave
the
asylum
i
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
go
i
have
been
here
so
long
that
i
am
very
much
attached
to
the
place
and
the
children
but
i
am
not
able
to
do
what
i
have
done
and
i
know
it
is
right
that
i
should
give
up
the
position
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
have
means
enough
to
live
plainly
the
remainder
of
my
life
i
intend
to
rent
or
buy
a
small
house
and
settle
down
and
be
quiet
i
feel
now
as
if
i
should
like
to
spend
my
days
in
peace
do
you
intend
to
live
alone
yes
child
except
a
servant
i
suppose
i
shall
be
quite
alone
but
you
will
come
to
see
me
often
and
perhaps
eugene
will
remember
me
some
day
when
he
is
in
trouble
no
i
shall
not
come
to
see
you
at
all
i
mean
to
come
and
live
with
you
that
is
if
i
may
cried
beulah
springing
up
and
laying
her
hand
on
the
matron
god
bless
you
dear
child
how
glad
i
shall
be
she
wound
her
arms
round
the
slender
form
and
laughed
through
her
tears
beulah
gently
put
back
the
gray
locks
that
had
fallen
from
the
border
of
her
cap
and
said
hopefully
i
am
sick
of
boarding
sick
of
town
let
us
get
a
nice
little
house
where
i
can
walk
in
and
out
to
my
school
have
you
selected
any
particular
place
no
i
have
looked
at
two
or
three
but
none
suited
me
exactly
now
you
can
help
me
i
am
so
thankful
you
are
going
to
be
with
me
will
you
come
as
soon
as
i
can
be
released
here
yes
just
as
soon
as
you
are
ready
for
me
and
i
think
i
know
a
house
for
rent
which
will
just
suit
us
now
i
want
it
understood
that
i
am
to
pay
the
rent
oh
no
child
i
wo
hear
to
it
for
i
am
very
well
then
i
will
stay
where
i
am
oh
beulah
you
are
not
in
earnest
yes
i
am
so
say
no
more
about
it
i
will
come
on
no
other
condition
i
will
see
the
owner
of
the
house
ascertain
what
i
can
obtain
it
for
and
send
you
word
then
you
can
look
at
it
and
decide
i
am
quite
willing
to
trust
it
to
you
child
only
i
ca
bear
the
thought
of
your
paying
the
rent
for
it
but
we
can
arrange
that
afterward
no
you
must
be
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
house
i
will
go
by
this
evening
and
find
out
about
it
so
as
to
let
you
know
at
once
have
you
any
idea
when
the
will
procure
another
matron
they
have
advertised
and
several
persons
applied
i
believe
but
they
were
not
exactly
pleased
with
the
applicants
i
suppose
however
that
in
a
few
days
they
will
find
a
substitute
for
me
well
be
sure
you
get
a
good
servant
and
now
i
must
go
she
put
on
her
bonnet
and
shawl
with
unwonted
haste
and
ran
down
the
steps
in
her
frequent
walks
she
had
noticed
two
cottages
in
course
of
erection
not
very
far
from
the
pine
grove
in
front
of
the
asylum
and
now
crossing
the
common
she
directed
her
steps
toward
them
the
lots
were
small
and
belonged
to
asbury
who
said
he
would
build
a
couple
of
cottages
for
poor
families
to
rent
at
cheap
rates
as
beulah
approached
the
houses
she
saw
the
doctor
buggy
standing
near
the
door
and
thinking
it
a
good
omen
quickened
her
steps
each
building
contained
only
three
rooms
and
a
hall
with
a
gallery
or
rather
portico
in
front
they
were
genuine
cottages
ornes
built
after
downing
plans
and
presented
a
tasteful
inviting
appearance
the
windows
were
arched
and
the
woodwork
elaborately
carved
beulah
pushed
open
the
freshly
painted
gate
ran
up
the
steps
and
into
the
hall
the
carpenters
were
still
at
work
in
the
kitchen
and
as
she
conjectured
here
she
found
her
friend
giving
some
final
directions
she
looked
round
the
snug
little
kitchen
and
walking
up
to
asbury
who
stood
with
his
back
to
the
door
she
shook
his
hand
with
a
cheerful
salutation
halloo
beulah
where
did
you
drop
from
glad
to
see
you
glad
to
see
you
how
came
you
prying
into
my
new
houses
answer
me
that
did
you
see
my
spouse
as
you
came
through
the
hall
no
i
will
go
back
and
hunt
for
her
you
need
not
there
she
comes
down
the
steps
of
the
house
she
would
insist
on
seeing
about
some
shelves
for
this
precious
kitchen
thinks
i
am
bound
to
put
pantries
and
closets
and
shelves
all
over
the
house
for
my
future
tenants
i
suppose
before
the
first
poor
family
takes
possession
i
shall
be
expected
to
fill
the
closet
with
table
linen
and
cutlery
and
the
larder
with
sugar
flour
and
wax
candles
look
here
asbury
how
many
more
shelves
is
this
kitchen
to
have
it
is
well
she
has
a
conscience
sir
since
nature
denied
you
one
answered
beulah
whom
asbury
received
very
affectionately
conscience
bless
my
soul
she
has
none
as
regards
my
unlucky
purse
positively
she
wanted
to
know
just
now
if
i
would
not
have
that
little
patch
of
ground
between
the
house
and
the
paling
laid
off
into
beds
and
if
i
would
not
plant
a
few
rose
bushes
and
vines
for
the
first
rascally
set
of
children
to
tear
up
by
the
roots
just
as
soon
as
their
parents
moved
in
there
conscience
for
you
with
a
vengeance
and
what
did
you
say
sir
what
did
i
say
why
just
what
every
other
meek
husband
says
to
appeals
which
cost
much
you
know
of
course
i
had
no
opinion
of
my
own
madame
here
is
infallible
so
i
am
put
down
for
maybe
a
hundred
dollars
more
you
need
not
have
asked
the
result
you
true
daughter
of
eve
every
one
of
you
understand
wheedling
those
two
mischievous
imps
of
mine
are
almost
as
great
adepts
as
their
mother
hey
beulah
no
whispering
there
you
look
as
wise
as
an
owl
what
am
i
to
do
next
paper
the
walls
and
fresco
the
ceilings
out
with
it
i
want
to
ask
sir
how
much
rent
your
conscience
will
allow
you
to
demand
for
this
of
a
house
well
i
had
an
idea
of
asking
two
hundred
dollars
for
it
cheap
enough
at
that
you
may
have
it
for
two
hundred
said
he
with
a
nod
toward
beulah
very
well
i
will
take
it
at
that
provided
williams
likes
it
as
well
as
i
do
in
a
day
or
two
i
will
determine
in
the
name
of
common
sense
beulah
what
freak
is
this
said
the
doctor
looking
at
her
with
astonishment
i
am
going
to
live
with
the
matron
of
the
asylum
whom
you
know
very
well
i
think
this
house
will
suit
us
exactly
and
the
rent
suits
my
purse
far
better
than
a
larger
building
would
i
am
tired
of
boarding
i
want
a
little
home
of
my
own
where
when
the
labors
of
school
are
over
i
can
feel
at
ease
the
walk
twice
a
day
will
benefit
me
i
feel
assured
you
need
not
look
so
dismal
and
perplexed
i
will
make
a
capital
tenant
your
sha
be
your
windows
sha
be
broken
nor
your
gate
swung
off
its
hinges
as
for
those
flowers
you
are
so
anxious
to
plant
and
that
patch
of
ground
you
are
so
much
interested
in
it
shall
blossom
like
the
plain
of
sharon
he
looked
at
her
wistfully
took
off
his
spectacles
wiped
them
with
the
end
of
his
coat
and
said
dubiously
what
does
hartwell
think
of
this
project
i
have
not
consulted
him
the
plain
english
of
which
is
that
whether
he
approves
or
condemns
you
are
determined
to
carry
out
this
new
plan
take
care
beulah
remember
the
old
adage
about
off
your
nose
to
spite
your
face
rather
malapropos
asbury
said
she
indifferently
i
am
an
old
man
beulah
and
know
something
of
life
and
the
world
nay
george
why
dissuade
her
from
this
plan
if
she
prefers
this
quiet
little
home
to
the
cenfinement
and
bustle
of
a
boarding
house
if
she
thinks
she
would
be
happier
here
with
williams
than
in
the
heart
of
the
city
why
should
not
she
come
suffer
her
to
judge
for
herself
i
am
disposed
to
applaud
her
choice
interrupted
asbury
alice
do
you
suppose
she
will
be
satisfied
to
bury
herself
out
here
with
an
infirm
old
woman
for
a
companion
here
she
must
have
an
early
breakfast
trudge
through
rain
and
cold
into
town
teach
stupid
little
brats
till
evening
then
listen
to
others
equally
stupid
thrum
over
music
lessons
and
at
last
tired
out
drag
herself
back
here
about
dark
when
it
is
too
late
to
see
whether
her
garden
is
a
cotton
patch
or
a
peach
orchard
will
you
please
to
tell
me
what
enjoyment
there
is
for
one
of
her
temperament
in
such
a
treadmill
existence
your
picture
is
all
shadow
george
and
even
if
it
were
not
she
is
the
best
judge
of
what
will
promote
her
happiness
do
not
discourage
her
ah
humble
as
the
place
is
i
know
how
her
heart
aches
for
a
spot
she
can
call
these
three
rooms
will
be
a
haven
of
rest
for
her
when
the
day
is
done
my
dear
beulah
i
trust
you
may
be
very
happy
here
or
wherever
you
decide
to
live
you
deserve
to
be
thank
you
madam
for
your
friendly
sympathy
i
am
glad
you
approve
my
design
well
well
if
you
soon
weary
of
this
freak
you
can
easily
give
up
the
house
that
is
all
now
beulah
if
you
determine
to
take
it
rest
assured
i
will
gladly
make
any
additions
or
alterations
you
may
suggest
i
dare
say
i
shall
like
you
for
a
tenant
but
see
here
asbury
i
have
patients
to
look
after
please
to
remember
that
i
am
a
professional
character
consequently
can
call
no
moment
my
own
what
another
row
of
shelves
round
that
side
this
building
houses
for
rent
is
a
ruinous
speculation
come
it
is
too
late
now
to
go
over
the
rooms
again
will
do
as
well
beulah
are
you
going
to
play
cook
too
no
indeed
williams
will
find
us
a
servant
i
will
decide
about
the
house
as
soon
as
possible
the
following
day
she
dispatched
a
note
to
the
matron
with
information
concerning
the
house
and
at
the
close
of
the
week
all
arrangements
were
completed
so
that
they
might
take
possession
as
soon
as
a
new
matron
was
secured
thus
the
last
of
october
glided
swiftly
away
and
one
cold
clear
day
in
november
beulah
was
notified
that
williams
was
comfortably
settled
in
the
new
home
she
went
to
school
as
usual
and
when
the
recitations
were
ended
started
out
with
a
glad
heart
and
springing
step
in
half
an
hour
she
reached
the
little
white
gate
and
found
williams
waiting
there
to
welcome
her
everything
was
new
and
neat
the
tastefully
selected
carpets
were
not
tapestry
but
cheap
ingrain
the
snowy
curtains
were
of
plain
dimity
with
borders
and
the
tea
table
held
instead
of
costly
sevres
simple
white
china
with
a
band
of
gilt
a
bright
fire
crackled
and
glowed
in
the
chimney
and
as
beulah
stood
on
the
hearth
and
glanced
round
the
comfortable
little
room
which
was
to
be
both
parlor
and
dining
room
she
felt
her
heart
thrill
with
delight
and
exclaimed
this
is
home
at
last
i
feel
that
i
have
a
home
of
my
own
not
the
rothschilds
in
their
palaces
are
so
happy
as
i
for
years
she
had
been
a
wanderer
with
no
hearthstone
and
now
for
the
first
time
since
her
father
death
she
was
at
home
not
the
home
of
adoption
nor
the
cheerless
room
of
a
boarding
house
but
the
humble
home
which
labor
and
rigid
economy
had
earned
for
her
her
heart
bounded
with
joy
an
unwonted
glow
suffused
her
cheeks
and
her
parted
lips
trembled
the
evening
passed
quickly
and
when
she
retired
to
her
own
room
she
was
surprised
to
find
a
handsome
rosewood
bookcase
and
desk
occupying
one
corner
she
opened
the
glass
doors
and
saw
her
books
carefully
arranged
on
the
shelves
could
her
guardian
have
sent
it
no
since
her
refusal
of
the
watch
she
felt
sure
he
would
not
have
offered
it
a
small
note
lay
on
the
shelf
and
recognizing
the
delicate
handwriting
she
read
the
lines
containing
these
words
beulah
accept
the
accompanying
case
and
desk
as
a
slight
testimony
of
the
affection
of
your
sincere
friend
alice
asbury
tears
sprang
into
her
eyes
as
she
opened
the
desk
and
discovered
an
elegant
pen
and
pencil
and
every
convenience
connected
with
writing
turning
away
she
saw
beside
the
fire
a
large
deep
cushioned
with
purple
morocco
and
knew
it
was
exactly
like
one
she
had
often
seen
in
asbury
library
on
the
back
was
pinned
a
narrow
slip
of
paper
and
she
read
in
the
doctor
scrawling
quaint
writing
child
do
be
too
proud
to
use
it
she
was
not
throwing
herself
into
the
luxurious
chair
she
broke
the
seal
of
a
letter
received
that
day
from
pauline
mortimor
once
before
soon
after
her
marriage
a
few
lines
of
gay
greeting
had
come
and
then
many
months
had
elapsed
as
she
unfolded
the
sheet
she
saw
with
sorrow
that
in
several
places
it
was
blotted
with
tears
and
the
contents
written
in
a
paroxysm
of
passion
disclosed
a
state
of
wretchedness
which
beulah
little
suspected
impulsive
fitful
nature
was
clearly
indexed
in
the
letter
and
after
a
brief
apology
for
her
long
silence
she
wrote
as
follows
oh
beulah
i
am
so
miserable
so
very
very
wretched
beulah
ernest
does
not
love
me
you
will
scarcely
believe
me
oh
i
hardly
know
how
to
believe
it
myself
uncle
guy
was
right
i
do
not
suit
ernest
but
i
loved
him
so
very
very
dearly
and
thought
him
so
devoted
to
me
fool
that
i
was
my
eyes
are
opened
at
last
beulah
it
nearly
drives
me
wild
to
think
that
i
am
bound
to
him
for
life
an
unloved
wife
not
a
year
has
passed
since
our
marriage
yet
already
he
has
tired
of
my
face
oh
beulah
if
i
could
only
come
to
you
and
put
my
arms
round
your
neck
and
lay
my
poor
weary
head
down
on
your
shoulder
then
i
could
tell
you
all
here
several
sentences
were
illegible
from
tears
and
she
could
only
read
what
followed
since
yesterday
morning
ernest
has
not
spoken
to
me
while
i
write
he
is
sitting
in
the
next
room
reading
as
cold
indifferent
and
calm
as
if
i
were
not
perfectly
wretched
he
is
tyrannical
and
because
i
do
not
humor
all
his
whims
and
have
some
will
of
my
own
he
treats
me
with
insulting
indifference
he
is
angry
now
because
i
resented
some
of
his
father
impertinent
speeches
about
my
dress
this
is
not
the
first
nor
the
second
time
that
we
have
quarreled
he
has
an
sister
who
is
forever
meddling
about
my
affairs
and
sneering
at
my
domestic
arrangements
and
because
i
finally
told
her
i
believed
i
was
mistress
of
my
own
house
ernest
has
never
forgiven
me
ellen
the
sister
i
loved
and
went
to
school
with
has
married
and
moved
to
a
distant
part
of
the
state
the
other
members
of
his
family
are
bigoted
proud
and
parsimonious
and
they
have
chiefly
made
the
breach
between
us
oh
beulah
if
i
could
only
undo
the
past
and
be
pauline
chilton
once
more
oh
if
i
could
be
free
and
happy
again
but
there
is
no
prospect
of
that
i
am
his
wife
as
he
told
me
yesterday
and
suppose
i
must
drag
out
a
miserable
existence
yet
i
will
not
be
trampled
on
by
his
family
his
sister
spends
much
of
her
time
with
us
reads
to
ernest
talks
to
him
about
things
that
she
glories
in
telling
me
i
do
understand
the
first
word
of
beulah
i
was
anxious
to
study
and
make
myself
a
companion
for
him
but
try
as
i
may
lucy
contrives
always
to
fret
and
thwart
me
two
days
ago
she
nearly
drove
me
beside
myself
with
her
sneers
and
allusions
to
my
great
mental
inferiority
to
ernest
as
if
i
were
not
often
enough
painfully
reminded
of
the
fact
without
any
of
her
assistance
i
know
i
should
not
have
said
it
but
i
was
too
angry
to
think
of
propriety
and
told
her
that
her
presence
in
my
home
was
very
disagreeable
oh
if
you
could
have
seen
her
insulting
smile
as
she
answered
that
her
brother
needed
her
and
she
felt
it
a
duty
to
remain
with
him
beulah
i
love
my
husband
i
would
do
anything
on
earth
to
make
him
happy
if
we
were
left
to
ourselves
but
as
to
submitting
to
lucy
arrogance
and
sneers
i
will
not
ernest
requires
me
to
apologize
to
his
father
and
sister
and
i
told
him
i
would
not
i
would
die
first
he
does
not
love
me
or
he
would
shield
me
from
such
trials
he
thinks
his
sister
is
perfection
and
i
tell
you
i
do
absolutely
detest
her
now
beulah
there
is
no
one
else
to
whom
i
would
mention
my
unhappiness
mother
does
not
suspect
it
and
never
shall
even
when
she
visits
me
uncle
guy
predicted
it
and
i
would
not
have
him
know
it
for
the
universe
but
i
can
trust
you
i
feel
that
you
will
sympathize
with
me
and
i
want
you
to
counsel
me
oh
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
to
rid
myself
of
this
tormenting
and
and
i
may
say
all
ernest
kin
sometimes
when
i
think
of
the
future
i
absolutely
shudder
for
if
matters
go
on
this
way
much
longer
i
shall
learn
to
hate
my
husband
too
he
knew
my
disposition
before
he
married
me
and
has
no
right
to
treat
me
as
he
does
if
it
were
only
ernest
i
could
bring
myself
to
him
for
i
love
him
very
devotedly
but
as
to
being
dictated
to
by
all
his
relatives
i
never
will
beulah
burn
this
blurred
letter
do
let
anybody
know
how
drearily
i
am
situated
i
am
too
proud
to
have
my
misery
published
to
know
that
people
pitied
me
would
kill
me
i
never
can
be
happy
again
but
perhaps
you
can
help
me
to
be
less
miserable
do
write
to
me
oh
how
i
wish
you
could
come
to
me
i
charge
you
beulah
do
let
uncle
guy
know
that
i
am
not
happy
oh
if
ever
you
marry
be
sure
your
husband
has
no
sisters
and
no
officious
kin
i
am
crying
so
that
i
can
barely
see
the
lines
dear
beulah
pauline
beulah
leaned
forward
and
dropped
the
letter
into
the
glowing
mass
of
coals
it
shriveled
blazed
and
vanished
and
with
a
heavy
sigh
she
sat
pondering
the
painful
contents
what
advice
could
she
possibly
give
that
would
remedy
the
trouble
she
was
aware
that
the
young
wife
must
indeed
have
been
very
wretched
before
she
could
consent
to
disclose
her
domestic
feuds
to
another
under
happier
auspices
she
felt
that
pauline
would
have
made
a
devoted
gentle
wife
but
feared
it
was
now
too
late
to
mold
her
character
in
conformity
with
her
husband
wishes
so
much
for
a
union
of
uncongenial
natures
thought
beulah
as
she
prepared
to
answer
the
unlucky
letter
as
guardedly
as
possible
she
alluded
to
mortimor
and
his
family
and
urged
pauline
to
talk
to
her
husband
gently
but
firmly
and
assure
him
that
the
continued
interference
of
his
family
was
unendurable
if
her
remonstrances
proved
futile
to
do
what
she
considered
due
to
herself
as
mistress
of
her
own
establishment
and
try
not
to
notice
the
annoyances
of
others
beulah
felt
and
acknowledged
her
inability
to
advise
the
young
wife
in
the
difficult
position
in
which
she
was
placed
and
closed
by
assuring
her
that
only
her
own
good
sense
guided
by
sincere
love
for
her
husband
could
rightly
direct
her
course
she
was
warmly
attached
to
pauline
and
it
was
with
a
troubled
heart
that
she
addressed
her
reply
chapter
xxix
the
grahams
were
all
at
home
again
and
eugene
and
his
bride
had
been
for
several
weeks
fairly
settled
in
their
elegant
new
house
beulah
had
seen
none
of
the
family
since
their
return
for
her
time
was
nearly
all
occupied
and
as
soon
as
released
from
school
she
gladly
hurried
out
to
her
little
home
one
evening
as
she
left
the
academy
graham
spirited
horses
dashed
up
to
the
gate
and
the
coachman
handed
her
a
note
it
was
from
graham
miss
benton
cornelia
is
quite
indisposed
and
begs
that
you
will
call
and
see
her
this
afternoon
as
it
threatens
rain
i
send
the
carriage
s
graham
beulah
crumpled
the
note
between
her
fingers
and
hesitated
the
coachman
perceived
her
irresolution
and
hastened
to
say
you
need
be
afraid
of
the
horses
miss
miss
nett
rides
so
much
they
are
tamed
down
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
the
horses
has
cornelia
been
sick
since
her
return
from
the
north
why
miss
she
came
home
worse
than
ever
she
has
not
been
downstairs
since
she
is
sick
all
the
time
now
beulah
hesitated
no
longer
graham
met
her
at
the
door
and
greeted
her
more
cordially
than
she
had
done
on
any
previous
occasion
she
looked
anxious
and
weary
and
said
as
she
led
the
way
to
her
daughter
apartment
we
are
quite
uneasy
about
cornelia
you
will
find
her
sadly
altered
she
ushered
beulah
into
the
room
then
immediately
withdrew
cornelia
was
propped
up
by
cushions
and
pillows
in
her
her
head
was
thrown
back
and
her
gaze
appeared
to
be
riveted
on
a
painting
which
hung
opposite
beulah
stood
beside
her
a
moment
unnoticed
and
saw
with
painful
surprise
the
ravages
which
disease
had
made
in
the
once
beautiful
face
and
queenly
form
the
black
shining
hair
was
cut
short
and
clustered
in
thick
wavy
locks
about
the
wan
brow
now
corrugated
as
by
some
spasm
of
pain
the
cheeks
were
hollow
and
ghastly
pale
the
eyes
sunken
but
unnaturally
large
and
brilliant
and
the
colorless
lips
compressed
as
though
to
bear
habitual
suffering
her
wasted
hands
grasping
the
arms
of
the
chair
might
have
served
as
a
model
for
a
statue
of
death
so
thin
pale
almost
transparent
beulah
softly
touched
one
of
them
and
said
cornelia
you
wished
to
see
me
the
invalid
looked
at
her
intently
and
smiled
i
thought
you
would
come
ah
beulah
do
you
recognize
this
wreck
as
your
former
friend
i
was
not
prepared
to
find
you
so
changed
for
until
this
afternoon
i
was
not
aware
your
trip
had
been
so
fruitless
do
you
suffer
much
suffer
yes
almost
all
the
time
but
it
is
not
the
bodily
torture
that
troubles
me
so
much
i
could
bear
that
in
silence
it
is
my
mind
beulah
my
mind
she
pointed
to
a
chair
beulah
drew
it
near
her
and
cornelia
continued
i
thought
i
should
die
suddenly
but
it
is
to
be
otherwise
the
torture
is
slow
lingering
i
shall
never
leave
this
house
again
except
to
go
to
my
final
home
beulah
i
have
wanted
to
see
you
very
much
i
thought
you
would
hear
of
my
illness
and
come
how
calm
and
pale
you
are
give
me
your
hand
ah
cool
and
pleasant
mine
parched
with
fever
and
you
have
a
little
home
of
your
own
i
hear
how
have
things
gone
with
you
since
we
parted
are
you
happy
my
little
home
is
pleasant
and
my
wants
are
few
replied
beulah
have
you
seen
eugene
recently
not
since
his
marriage
a
bitter
laugh
escaped
cornelia
lips
as
she
writhed
an
instant
and
then
said
i
knew
how
it
would
be
i
shall
not
live
to
see
the
end
but
you
will
ha
beulah
already
he
has
discovered
his
mistake
i
did
not
expect
it
so
soon
i
fancied
antoinette
had
more
policy
she
has
dropped
the
mask
he
sees
himself
wedded
to
a
woman
completely
devoid
of
truth
he
knows
her
now
as
she
is
as
i
tried
to
show
him
she
was
before
it
was
too
late
and
beulah
as
i
expected
he
has
grown
reckless
desperate
ah
if
you
could
have
witnessed
a
scene
at
the
nicholas
in
new
york
not
long
since
you
would
have
wept
over
him
he
found
his
bride
heartless
saw
that
she
preferred
the
society
of
other
gentlemen
to
his
that
she
lived
only
for
the
adulation
of
the
crowd
and
one
evening
on
coming
home
to
the
hotel
found
she
had
gone
to
the
opera
with
a
party
she
knew
he
detested
beulah
it
sickens
me
when
i
think
of
his
fierce
railings
and
anguish
and
scorn
he
drank
in
mad
defiance
and
when
she
returned
greeted
her
with
imprecations
that
would
have
bowed
any
other
woman
in
utter
humiliation
into
the
dust
she
laughed
derisively
told
him
he
might
amuse
himself
as
he
chose
she
would
not
heed
his
wishes
as
regarded
her
own
movements
luckily
my
parents
knew
nothing
of
it
they
little
suspected
nor
do
they
now
know
why
i
was
taken
so
alarmingly
ill
before
dawn
i
am
glad
i
am
to
go
so
soon
i
could
not
endure
to
witness
his
misery
and
disgrace
she
closed
her
eyes
and
groaned
what
induced
her
to
marry
him
asked
beulah
only
her
own
false
heart
knows
but
i
have
always
believed
she
was
chiefly
influenced
by
a
desire
to
escape
from
the
strict
discipline
to
which
her
father
subjected
her
at
home
her
mother
was
anything
but
a
model
of
propriety
and
her
mother
sister
who
was
hartwell
wife
was
not
more
exemplary
my
uncle
endeavored
to
curb
antoinette
dangerous
fondness
for
display
and
dissipation
and
she
fancied
that
as
eugene
wife
she
could
freely
plunge
into
gayeties
which
were
sparingly
allowed
her
at
home
i
know
she
does
not
love
eugene
she
never
did
and
assuredly
his
future
is
dark
enough
i
believe
if
she
could
reform
him
she
would
not
his
excesses
sanction
or
at
least
in
some
degree
palliate
hers
oh
beulah
i
see
no
hope
for
him
have
you
talked
to
him
kindly
cornelia
have
you
faithfully
exerted
your
influence
to
check
him
in
his
route
to
ruin
talked
to
him
aye
entreated
remonstrated
upbraided
used
every
argument
at
my
command
but
i
might
as
well
talk
to
the
winds
and
hope
to
hush
their
fury
i
shall
not
stay
to
see
his
end
i
shall
soon
be
silent
and
beyond
all
suffering
death
is
welcome
very
welcome
her
breathing
was
quick
and
difficult
and
two
crimson
spots
burned
on
her
sallow
cheeks
her
whole
face
told
of
years
of
bitterness
and
a
grim
defiance
of
death
which
sent
a
shudder
through
beulah
as
she
listened
to
the
panting
breath
cornelia
saturated
her
handkerchief
with
some
delicate
perfume
from
a
crystal
vase
and
passing
it
over
her
face
continued
they
tell
me
it
is
time
i
should
be
confirmed
talk
vaguely
of
seeing
preachers
and
taking
the
sacrament
and
preparing
myself
as
if
i
could
be
frightened
into
religion
and
the
church
my
mother
seems
just
to
have
waked
up
to
a
knowledge
of
my
spiritual
condition
as
she
calls
it
ah
beulah
it
is
all
dark
before
me
black
black
as
midnight
i
am
going
down
to
an
eternal
night
down
to
annihilation
yes
beulah
soon
i
shall
descend
into
what
schiller
moor
calls
the
yonder
before
long
i
shall
have
done
with
mystery
shall
be
sunk
into
unbroken
rest
a
ghastly
smile
parted
her
lips
as
she
spoke
cornelia
do
you
fear
death
no
not
exactly
i
am
glad
i
am
so
soon
to
be
rid
of
my
vexed
joyless
life
but
you
know
it
is
all
a
dark
mystery
and
sometimes
when
i
recollect
how
i
felt
in
my
childhood
i
shrink
from
the
final
dissolution
i
have
no
hopes
of
a
blissful
future
such
as
cheer
some
people
in
their
last
hour
of
what
comes
after
death
i
know
and
believe
nothing
occasionally
i
shiver
at
the
thought
of
annihilation
but
if
after
all
revelation
is
true
i
have
something
worse
than
annihilation
to
fear
you
know
the
history
of
my
skepticism
it
is
the
history
of
hundreds
in
this
age
the
inconsistencies
of
professing
christians
disgusted
me
perhaps
i
was
wrong
to
reject
the
doctrines
because
of
their
abuse
but
it
is
too
late
now
for
me
to
consider
that
i
narrowly
watched
the
conduct
of
some
of
the
members
of
the
various
churches
and
as
i
live
beulah
i
have
never
seen
but
one
who
practiced
the
precepts
of
christ
i
concluded
she
would
have
been
just
what
she
was
without
religious
aids
one
of
my
mother
intimate
friends
was
an
ostentatious
pharisaical
christian
gave
alms
headed
charity
lists
was
remarkably
punctual
in
her
attendance
at
church
and
apparently
very
devout
yet
i
accidentally
found
out
that
she
treated
a
poor
seamstress
whom
she
hired
for
a
paltry
sum
in
a
manner
that
shocked
my
ideas
of
consistency
of
common
humanity
the
girl
was
miserably
poor
and
had
aged
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
dependent
on
her
exertions
but
her
christian
employer
paid
her
the
lowest
possible
price
and
trampled
on
her
feelings
as
though
she
had
been
a
brute
oh
the
hollowness
of
the
religion
i
saw
practiced
i
sneered
at
everything
connected
with
churches
and
heard
no
more
sermons
which
seemed
only
to
make
hypocrites
and
pharisees
of
the
congregation
i
have
never
known
but
one
exception
asbury
is
a
consistent
christian
i
have
watched
her
under
various
circumstances
i
have
tempted
her
in
divers
ways
to
test
her
and
skeptic
as
i
am
i
admire
and
revere
that
noble
woman
if
all
christians
set
an
example
as
pure
and
bright
as
hers
there
were
less
infidelity
and
atheism
in
the
land
if
i
had
known
even
half
a
dozen
such
i
might
have
had
a
faith
to
cheer
me
in
the
hour
of
my
struggle
she
used
to
talk
gently
to
me
in
days
past
but
i
would
not
heed
her
she
often
comes
to
see
me
now
and
though
i
do
not
believe
the
words
of
comfort
that
fall
from
her
lips
still
they
soothe
me
and
i
love
to
have
her
sit
near
me
that
i
may
look
at
her
sweet
holy
face
so
full
of
winning
purity
beulah
a
year
ago
we
talked
of
these
things
i
was
then
as
now
hopeless
of
creeds
of
truth
but
you
were
sure
you
would
find
the
truth
i
looked
at
you
eagerly
when
you
came
in
knowing
i
could
read
the
result
in
your
countenance
ah
there
is
no
peace
written
there
where
is
your
truth
show
it
to
me
she
twined
her
thin
hot
fingers
round
beulah
cold
hand
and
spoke
in
a
weary
tone
the
orphan
features
twitched
an
instant
and
her
old
troubled
look
came
back
as
she
said
i
wish
i
could
help
you
cornelia
it
must
be
terrible
indeed
to
stand
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
and
have
no
belief
in
anything
i
would
give
more
than
i
possess
to
be
able
to
assist
you
but
i
can
not
i
have
no
truth
to
offer
you
i
have
yet
discovered
nothing
for
myself
i
am
not
so
sanguine
as
i
was
a
year
ago
but
i
still
hope
that
i
shall
succeed
you
will
not
you
will
not
it
is
all
mocking
mystery
and
no
more
than
the
aggregated
generations
of
the
past
can
you
find
any
solution
cornelia
shook
her
head
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
philosophy
promises
one
replied
beulah
resolutely
philosophy
take
care
that
hidden
rock
stranded
me
listen
to
me
philosophy
or
what
is
nowadays
its
synonym
metaphysical
systems
are
worse
than
useless
they
will
make
you
doubt
your
own
individual
existence
if
that
be
possible
i
am
older
than
you
i
am
a
sample
of
the
efficacy
of
such
systems
oh
the
philosophers
of
this
century
and
the
last
are
crowned
heads
of
humbuggery
adepts
in
the
famous
art
of
nonsense
round
with
pomp
and
darkness
till
it
seems
profound
they
mock
earnest
enquiring
minds
with
their
refined
infinitesimal
homeopathic
of
deity
metaphysical
wolves
in
socratic
cloaks
oh
they
have
much
to
answer
for
of
philosophy
ha
ha
they
have
made
a
frog
pond
of
it
in
which
to
launch
their
flimsy
painted
toy
barks
have
done
with
them
beulah
or
you
will
be
miserably
duped
have
you
lost
faith
in
emerson
and
theodore
parker
asked
beulah
yes
lost
faith
in
everything
and
everybody
except
asbury
emerson
atheistic
fatalism
is
enough
to
unhinge
human
reason
he
is
a
great
and
i
believe
an
honest
thinker
and
of
his
genius
i
have
the
profoundest
admiration
an
intellectual
titan
he
wages
a
desperate
war
with
received
creeds
and
rising
on
the
ruins
of
systems
struggles
to
scale
the
battlements
of
truth
as
for
parker
a
careful
perusal
of
his
works
was
enough
to
disgust
me
but
no
more
of
this
beulah
so
long
as
you
have
found
nothing
to
rest
upon
i
had
hoped
much
from
your
earnest
search
but
since
it
has
been
futile
let
the
subject
drop
give
me
that
glass
of
medicine
hartwell
was
here
just
before
you
came
he
is
morose
and
haggard
what
ails
him
i
really
do
know
i
have
not
seen
him
for
several
months
not
since
august
i
believe
so
i
supposed
as
i
questioned
him
about
you
and
he
seemed
ignorant
of
your
movements
beulah
does
not
life
look
dreary
and
tedious
when
you
anticipate
years
of
labor
and
care
teaching
is
not
child
sport
are
you
not
already
weary
in
spirit
no
i
am
not
weary
neither
does
life
seem
joyless
i
know
that
i
shall
have
to
labor
for
a
support
but
necessity
always
supplies
strength
i
have
many
very
many
sources
of
happiness
and
look
forward
hopefully
to
a
life
of
usefulness
do
you
intend
to
teach
all
your
days
are
you
going
to
wear
out
your
life
over
primers
and
slates
perhaps
so
i
know
not
how
else
i
shall
more
easily
earn
a
subsistence
i
trust
you
will
marry
and
be
exempted
from
that
dull
tedious
routine
said
cornelia
watching
her
countenance
beulah
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
that
is
a
mode
of
exemption
so
extremely
remote
that
i
never
consider
it
i
do
not
find
teaching
so
disagreeable
as
you
imagine
and
dare
say
at
fifty
if
i
live
that
long
i
shall
still
be
in
a
schoolroom
remember
the
trite
line
dreamed
and
thought
that
life
was
beauty
i
woke
and
found
that
life
was
duty
labor
mental
and
physical
is
the
heritage
of
humanity
and
happiness
is
inseparably
bound
up
with
the
discharge
of
duty
it
is
a
divine
decree
that
all
should
work
and
a
compliance
with
that
decree
insures
a
proper
development
of
the
moral
intellectual
and
physical
nature
you
are
brave
beulah
and
have
more
of
hope
in
your
nature
than
i
for
years
i
have
been
a
petted
child
but
life
has
given
me
little
enjoyment
often
have
i
asked
why
was
i
created
for
what
am
i
destined
i
have
been
like
a
gilded
bubble
tossed
about
by
every
breath
oh
beulah
often
in
the
desolation
of
my
heart
i
have
recalled
that
grim
passage
of
pollok
and
that
that
verily
i
was
that
which
god
had
made
superfluously
and
needed
not
to
build
creation
with
but
back
again
to
nothing
threw
and
left
it
in
the
void
with
everlasting
sense
that
once
it
was
my
life
has
not
been
useful
it
has
been
but
joyless
and
clouded
with
the
shadow
of
death
from
my
childhood
her
voice
was
broken
and
tears
trickled
over
her
emaciated
face
she
put
up
her
thin
hand
and
brushed
them
away
as
if
ashamed
of
her
emotion
sometimes
i
think
if
i
could
only
live
and
be
strong
i
would
make
myself
useful
in
the
world
would
try
to
be
less
selfish
and
exacting
but
all
regrets
are
vain
and
the
indulged
child
of
luxury
must
take
her
place
in
the
pale
realms
of
death
along
with
the
and
laboring
beulah
i
was
in
pain
last
night
and
could
not
sleep
and
for
hours
i
seemed
to
hear
the
words
of
that
horrible
vision
he
saw
how
world
after
world
shook
off
its
glimmering
souls
upon
the
sea
of
death
as
a
scatters
swimming
lights
on
the
waves
oh
my
mind
is
clouded
and
my
heart
hopeless
it
is
dismal
to
stand
alone
as
i
do
and
confront
the
final
issue
without
belief
in
anything
sometimes
when
the
paroxysms
are
severe
and
prolonged
i
grow
impatient
of
the
tedious
delay
and
would
spring
to
meet
death
the
deliverer
beulah
was
deeply
moved
and
answered
with
a
faltering
voice
and
trembling
lip
i
wish
i
could
comfort
and
cheer
you
but
i
can
not
i
can
not
if
the
hand
of
disease
placed
me
on
the
brink
beside
you
i
should
be
as
hopeless
as
you
oh
cornelia
it
makes
my
heart
ache
to
look
at
you
now
and
i
would
give
my
life
to
be
able
to
stand
where
you
do
with
a
calm
trust
in
the
god
of
israel
but
then
be
warned
by
my
example
in
many
respects
we
resemble
each
other
our
pursuits
have
been
similar
beulah
do
not
follow
me
to
the
end
take
my
word
for
it
all
is
dark
and
grim
she
sank
back
too
much
exhausted
to
continue
the
conversation
and
beulah
rose
to
go
ca
you
stay
with
me
said
the
feeble
girl
no
my
companionship
is
no
benefit
to
you
now
if
i
could
help
you
i
would
not
leave
you
at
all
she
pressed
her
lips
to
the
forehead
furrowed
by
suffering
and
hastened
away
it
was
dusk
when
she
reached
home
and
passing
the
dining
room
where
the
tea
table
awaited
her
arrival
she
sought
her
own
apartment
a
cheerful
fire
blazed
in
welcome
but
just
now
all
things
were
somber
to
her
vision
and
she
threw
herself
into
a
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
like
a
haunting
specter
cornelia
haggard
countenance
pursued
her
and
a
dull
foreboding
pointed
to
a
coming
season
when
she
too
would
quit
earth
in
hopeless
uncertainty
she
thought
of
her
guardian
and
his
skeptical
misanthropy
he
had
explored
every
of
speculation
and
after
years
of
study
and
investigation
had
given
up
in
despair
and
settled
down
into
a
refined
pantheism
could
she
hope
to
succeed
better
was
her
intellect
so
vastly
superior
to
those
who
for
thousands
of
years
had
puzzled
by
midnight
lamps
over
these
identical
questions
of
origin
and
destiny
what
was
the
speculation
of
all
ages
from
thales
to
comte
to
the
dying
girl
she
had
just
left
poor
beulah
for
the
first
time
her
courage
forsook
her
and
bitter
tears
gushed
over
her
white
cheeks
there
was
no
stony
bitterness
in
her
face
but
an
unlifting
shadow
that
mutely
revealed
the
unnumbered
hours
of
strife
and
desolation
which
were
slowly
bowing
that
brave
heart
to
the
dust
she
shuddered
as
now
in
communion
she
felt
that
atheism
grim
and
murderous
stood
at
the
entrance
of
her
soul
and
threw
its
benumbing
shadow
into
the
inmost
recesses
unbelief
hung
its
murky
vapors
about
her
heart
curtaining
it
from
the
sunshine
of
god
smile
it
was
not
difficult
to
trace
her
gradual
progress
if
so
she
might
term
her
unsatisfactory
journey
rejecting
literal
revelation
she
was
perplexed
to
draw
the
exact
line
of
demarcation
between
myths
and
realities
then
followed
doubts
as
to
the
necessity
and
finally
as
to
the
probability
and
possibility
of
an
external
verbal
revelation
a
revealed
code
or
system
was
antagonistic
to
the
doctrines
of
rationalism
her
own
consciousness
must
furnish
the
necessary
data
but
how
far
was
individualism
allowable
and
here
the
hydra
of
speculation
reared
its
horrid
head
if
consciousness
alone
furnished
truth
it
was
but
true
for
her
true
according
to
the
formation
of
her
mind
but
not
absolutely
true
admit
the
supremacy
of
the
individual
reason
and
she
could
not
deny
that
the
individual
mind
is
the
generating
principle
of
all
human
knowledge
that
the
soul
of
man
is
like
the
silkworm
which
weaves
its
universe
out
of
its
own
being
that
the
whole
mass
of
knowledge
to
which
we
can
ever
attain
lies
potentially
within
us
from
the
beginning
that
all
truth
is
nothing
more
than
a
she
became
entangled
in
the
finely
spun
webs
of
ontology
and
knew
not
what
she
believed
her
guardian
words
rang
in
her
ears
like
a
knell
you
must
accept
either
utter
skepticism
or
absolute
consistent
pantheism
a
volume
which
she
had
been
reading
the
night
before
lay
on
the
table
and
she
opened
it
at
the
following
passage
every
being
is
sufficient
to
itself
that
is
every
being
is
in
and
by
itself
infinite
has
its
god
its
highest
conceivable
being
in
itself
the
object
of
any
subject
is
nothing
else
than
the
subject
own
nature
taken
objectively
such
as
are
a
man
thoughts
and
dispositions
such
is
his
god
consciousness
of
god
is
consciousness
by
his
god
you
know
the
man
and
by
the
man
his
god
the
two
are
identical
religion
is
merely
the
consciousness
which
a
man
has
of
his
own
not
limited
but
infinite
nature
it
is
an
early
form
of
god
is
the
objective
nature
of
the
understanding
thus
much
feuerbach
offered
her
she
put
down
the
book
and
leaned
her
head
wearily
on
her
hands
a
light
touch
on
her
arm
caused
her
to
glance
up
and
williams
anxious
face
looked
down
at
her
what
is
the
matter
with
you
beulah
are
you
sick
no
i
am
as
well
as
usual
she
hastily
averted
her
head
but
something
troubles
you
child
yes
a
great
many
things
trouble
me
but
i
am
used
to
troubles
you
know
and
can
cope
with
them
unaided
wo
you
tell
me
what
they
are
beulah
you
can
not
help
me
or
i
would
one
cause
of
sorrow
however
is
the
approaching
death
of
a
friend
whom
i
shall
miss
and
mourn
cornelia
graham
can
not
live
much
longer
i
saw
her
this
evening
and
found
that
she
has
become
sadly
altered
she
is
young
to
die
said
the
matron
with
a
sigh
yes
only
perhaps
her
death
will
be
the
means
of
reclaiming
my
poor
boy
beulah
shook
her
head
and
williams
added
she
has
lived
only
for
this
world
and
its
pleasures
is
she
afraid
of
the
world
to
come
can
she
die
peacefully
she
will
die
calmly
but
not
hopefully
she
does
not
believe
in
christianity
she
felt
that
the
matron
was
searching
her
countenance
and
was
not
surprised
when
she
said
falteringly
neither
do
you
believe
in
it
oh
beulah
i
have
known
it
since
you
came
to
reside
under
the
same
roof
with
me
and
i
have
wept
and
prayed
over
you
almost
as
much
as
over
eugene
when
sabbath
after
sabbath
passed
and
you
absented
yourself
from
church
i
knew
something
was
wrong
beulah
who
has
taught
you
infidelity
oh
it
would
have
been
better
that
you
too
had
followed
lilly
in
the
early
days
when
you
were
pure
in
heart
much
as
i
love
you
i
would
rather
weep
over
your
grave
than
know
you
had
lived
to
forget
god
beulah
made
no
reply
and
passing
her
hands
tenderly
over
the
girl
head
she
continued
when
you
came
to
me
a
little
child
i
taught
you
your
morning
and
evening
prayers
oh
beulah
beulah
now
you
lay
down
to
sleep
without
a
thought
of
prayer
my
child
what
is
to
become
of
you
i
do
know
but
do
not
be
distressed
about
me
i
am
trying
to
do
my
duty
just
as
conscientiously
as
though
i
went
to
church
do
deceive
yourself
dear
child
if
you
cease
to
pray
and
read
your
bible
how
are
you
to
know
what
your
duty
is
how
are
you
to
keep
yourself
and
unspotted
from
the
world
beulah
a
man
without
religion
is
to
be
pitied
but
oh
a
godless
woman
is
a
horror
above
all
things
it
is
no
marvel
you
look
so
anxious
and
you
have
forsaken
the
of
pleasantness
and
the
paths
of
peace
i
am
responsible
to
no
one
for
my
opinions
yes
you
are
responsible
to
god
for
he
has
given
truth
to
the
world
and
when
you
shut
your
eyes
and
willingly
walk
in
darkness
he
will
judge
you
accordingly
if
you
had
lived
in
an
indian
jungle
out
of
hearing
of
gospel
truth
then
god
would
not
have
expected
anything
but
idolatry
from
you
but
you
live
in
a
christian
land
in
the
land
of
bibles
and
whom
much
is
given
much
will
be
expected
the
people
of
this
generation
are
running
after
new
doctrines
and
overtake
much
error
beulah
since
i
have
seen
you
sitting
up
nearly
all
night
pouring
over
books
that
rail
at
jesus
and
his
doctrines
i
have
repented
the
hour
i
first
suggested
your
educating
yourself
to
teach
if
this
is
what
all
your
learning
has
brought
you
to
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
been
put
out
to
learn
millinery
or
oh
my
child
you
have
been
my
greatest
pride
but
now
you
are
a
grief
to
me
she
took
beulah
hand
in
hers
and
pressed
her
lips
to
it
while
the
tears
fell
thick
and
fast
the
orphan
was
not
unmoved
her
lashes
were
heavy
with
unshed
drops
but
she
said
nothing
beulah
i
am
years
old
i
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
and
i
tell
you
i
have
never
yet
known
a
happy
man
or
woman
who
did
not
reverence
god
and
religion
i
can
see
that
you
are
not
happy
child
you
never
will
be
so
long
as
you
wander
away
from
god
i
pray
for
you
but
you
must
also
pray
for
yourself
may
god
help
you
my
dear
child
she
left
her
knowing
her
nature
too
well
to
hope
to
convince
her
of
her
error
beulah
remained
for
some
time
in
the
same
position
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
fire
and
her
forehead
plowed
by
torturing
thought
the
striking
of
the
clock
roused
her
from
her
reverie
and
drawing
a
chair
near
her
desk
she
took
up
her
pen
to
complete
an
article
due
the
next
day
at
the
magazine
office
ah
how
little
the
readers
dreamed
of
the
heavy
heart
that
put
aside
its
troubles
to
labor
for
their
amusement
she
did
not
succeed
as
well
as
usual
her
manuscript
was
blurred
and
forced
to
copy
the
greater
part
of
it
the
clock
struck
three
before
she
laid
her
weary
head
on
her
pillow
chapter
xxx
graham
sat
by
his
daughter
bed
with
his
elbow
resting
on
her
pillow
and
his
head
drooped
on
his
hand
it
was
noon
and
sunshine
sparkled
out
of
doors
but
here
the
heavy
curtains
swept
across
the
windows
and
cast
a
lurid
light
over
the
sickroom
his
heart
ached
as
he
looked
upon
the
wreck
of
his
once
brilliant
and
beautiful
child
and
he
shaded
his
face
to
conceal
the
tears
which
stole
down
his
furrowed
cheeks
the
restless
sufferer
threw
up
her
arms
over
the
pillow
and
turning
toward
him
said
in
a
voice
sharpened
by
disease
has
mother
gone
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
we
are
alone
my
child
speak
to
me
freely
there
are
a
few
things
i
wish
to
have
arranged
and
my
time
is
short
you
have
never
refused
me
any
gratification
i
desired
and
i
know
you
will
grant
my
last
request
father
if
i
were
a
bride
day
what
would
be
my
portion
of
the
estate
how
much
would
you
give
me
i
would
give
every
cent
i
possess
to
purchase
you
a
life
of
happiness
you
do
not
understand
me
i
have
always
been
considered
an
heiress
and
i
want
to
know
how
much
i
would
be
entitled
to
if
i
should
live
of
course
eugene
has
an
equal
share
how
much
is
it
about
eighty
thousand
dollars
apiece
i
suppose
leaving
as
much
for
your
mother
why
do
you
ask
my
daughter
eighty
thousand
dollars
how
much
good
might
be
done
with
it
if
judiciously
distributed
and
invested
father
i
shall
not
live
to
squander
it
in
frivolous
amusements
or
superfluous
luxuries
are
you
willing
that
i
should
dispose
of
a
portion
of
it
before
my
death
yes
cornelia
if
it
will
afford
you
any
gratification
my
poor
afflicted
child
how
can
i
deny
you
anything
you
choose
to
ask
she
put
up
one
arm
around
his
neck
and
drawing
his
head
close
to
her
said
earnestly
i
only
wish
to
use
a
part
of
it
father
i
want
to
leave
beulah
about
five
thousand
dollars
that
sum
will
enable
her
to
live
more
comfortably
and
labor
less
and
i
should
like
to
feel
before
i
die
that
i
had
been
the
means
of
assisting
her
will
you
invest
that
amount
in
stocks
for
her
or
pay
the
money
into
her
own
hands
will
you
see
that
it
is
arranged
so
that
she
will
certainly
receive
it
no
matter
what
happens
yes
i
promise
you
that
she
shall
have
five
thousand
dollars
to
dispose
of
as
she
thinks
proper
she
is
proud
and
will
not
receive
it
willingly
but
you
must
arrange
it
so
that
she
will
be
benefited
by
it
father
can
you
do
this
for
me
yes
without
difficulty
i
think
let
it
be
kept
secret
will
you
rest
assured
it
shall
have
no
unnecessary
publicity
see
that
it
is
conveyed
to
her
so
securely
that
no
quibbles
of
law
can
wrest
it
from
her
at
any
future
day
for
none
of
us
knows
what
may
happen
i
promise
you
she
shall
have
it
if
i
live
twelve
hours
longer
then
i
want
five
thousand
more
given
to
the
orphan
asylum
give
it
in
your
own
name
you
only
have
the
right
to
give
do
have
my
name
mentioned
in
the
matter
will
you
promise
me
this
also
yes
it
shall
all
be
done
is
there
anything
else
thank
you
that
is
all
as
regards
money
matters
raise
my
pillow
a
little
there
that
will
do
father
ca
you
do
something
to
save
eugene
you
must
see
now
how
reckless
he
is
growing
recently
i
have
expostulated
with
him
and
he
seemed
disposed
to
reform
his
habits
acknowledged
that
his
associations
had
been
injurious
and
regretted
the
excesses
into
which
he
had
been
led
he
has
been
rather
wild
since
he
came
from
college
but
i
think
now
he
is
married
he
will
sober
down
that
is
one
reason
why
i
encouraged
his
marrying
so
early
intemperance
is
his
only
fault
and
i
trust
his
good
sense
will
soon
lead
him
to
correct
it
a
smothered
sigh
concluded
the
sentence
father
antoinette
is
not
the
woman
to
reform
him
do
trust
to
her
influence
if
you
do
eugene
will
be
ruined
watch
over
him
closely
yourself
try
to
win
him
away
from
the
haunts
of
dissipation
i
tell
you
now
his
wife
will
never
do
it
she
has
duped
you
and
my
mother
as
to
her
character
but
you
will
find
that
she
is
as
utterly
heartless
as
her
own
mother
was
i
always
opposed
the
match
because
i
probed
her
mask
of
dissimulation
and
knew
eugene
could
not
be
happy
with
her
but
the
mistake
is
irretrievable
and
it
only
remains
for
you
to
watch
him
the
more
carefully
lift
me
father
i
ca
breathe
easily
there
is
the
doctor
on
the
steps
i
am
too
tired
to
talk
any
more
one
week
later
as
beulah
was
spending
her
sabbath
evening
in
her
own
apartment
she
was
summoned
to
see
her
friend
for
the
last
time
it
was
twilight
when
she
reached
graham
house
and
glided
noiselessly
up
the
thickly
carpeted
stairway
the
bells
were
all
muffled
and
a
solemn
stillness
reigned
over
the
mansion
she
left
her
bonnet
and
shawl
in
the
hall
and
softly
entered
the
chamber
unannounced
unable
to
breathe
in
a
horizontal
position
cornelia
was
bolstered
up
in
her
easychair
her
mother
sat
near
her
with
her
face
hid
on
her
husband
bosom
hartwell
leaned
against
the
mantel
and
eugene
stood
on
the
hearth
opposite
him
with
his
head
bowed
down
on
his
hands
cornelia
drew
her
breath
in
quick
gasps
and
cold
drops
glistened
on
her
pallid
face
her
sunken
eyes
wandered
over
the
group
and
when
beulah
drew
near
she
extended
her
hands
eagerly
while
a
shadowy
smile
passed
swiftly
over
her
sharpened
features
beulah
come
close
to
me
close
she
grasped
her
hands
tightly
and
beulah
knelt
at
the
side
of
her
chair
beulah
in
a
little
while
i
shall
be
at
rest
you
will
rejoice
to
see
me
free
from
pain
wo
you
i
have
suffered
for
so
many
months
and
years
but
death
is
about
to
release
me
forever
beulah
is
it
forever
is
it
forever
am
i
going
down
into
an
eternal
sleep
on
a
marble
couch
where
grass
and
flowers
will
wave
over
me
and
the
sun
shine
down
on
me
yes
it
must
be
so
who
has
ever
waked
from
this
last
dreamless
slumber
abel
was
the
first
to
fall
asleep
and
since
then
who
has
wakened
no
one
earth
is
full
of
pale
sleepers
and
i
am
soon
to
join
the
silent
band
there
was
a
flickering
light
in
her
eyes
like
the
flame
of
a
candle
low
in
its
socket
and
her
panting
breath
was
painful
to
listen
to
cornelia
they
say
jesus
of
nazareth
slept
and
woke
again
if
so
you
will
ha
but
you
do
believe
that
beulah
they
say
they
say
yes
but
i
never
believed
them
before
and
i
do
want
to
believe
them
now
i
will
not
believe
it
it
is
too
late
to
tell
me
that
now
beulah
i
shall
know
very
soon
the
veil
of
mystery
is
being
lifted
oh
beulah
i
am
glad
i
am
going
glad
i
shall
soon
have
no
more
sorrow
and
pain
but
it
is
all
dark
dark
you
know
what
i
mean
do
live
as
i
have
believing
nothing
no
matter
what
your
creed
may
be
hold
fast
have
firm
faith
in
it
it
is
because
i
believe
in
nothing
that
i
am
so
clouded
now
oh
it
is
such
a
dark
dark
lonely
way
if
i
had
a
friend
to
go
with
me
i
should
not
shrink
back
but
oh
beulah
i
am
so
solitary
it
seems
to
me
i
am
going
out
into
a
great
starless
midnight
she
shivered
and
her
cold
fingers
clutched
beulah
convulsively
calm
yourself
cornelia
if
christianity
is
true
god
will
see
that
you
were
honest
in
your
skepticism
and
judge
you
leniently
if
not
then
death
is
annihilation
and
you
have
nothing
to
dread
you
will
sink
into
quiet
oblivion
of
all
your
griefs
annihilation
then
i
shall
see
you
all
no
more
oh
why
was
i
ever
created
to
love
others
and
then
be
torn
away
forever
and
go
back
to
senseless
dust
i
never
have
been
happy
i
have
always
had
aspirations
after
purer
higher
enjoyments
than
earth
could
afford
me
and
must
they
be
lost
in
dead
clay
oh
beulah
can
you
give
me
no
comfort
but
this
is
this
the
sum
of
all
your
study
as
well
as
mine
ah
it
is
vain
useless
man
can
find
out
nothing
we
are
all
blind
groping
our
way
through
mysterious
paths
and
now
i
am
going
into
the
last
the
great
mystery
she
shook
her
head
with
a
bitter
smile
and
closed
her
eyes
as
if
to
shut
out
some
hideous
specter
hartwell
gave
her
a
spoonful
of
some
powerful
medicine
and
stood
watching
her
face
distorted
by
the
difficulty
of
breathing
a
long
silence
ensued
broken
only
by
the
sobs
of
the
parents
cornelia
leaned
back
with
closed
eyes
and
now
and
then
her
lips
moved
but
nothing
intelligible
escaped
them
it
was
surprising
how
she
seemed
to
rally
sometimes
and
breathe
with
perfect
ease
then
the
paroxysms
would
come
on
more
violent
than
ever
beulah
knelt
on
the
floor
with
her
forehead
resting
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
and
her
hands
still
grasped
in
the
firm
hold
of
the
dying
girl
time
seemed
to
stand
still
to
watch
the
issue
for
moments
were
long
as
hours
to
the
few
friends
of
the
sufferer
beulah
felt
as
if
her
heart
were
leaden
and
a
band
of
burning
iron
seemed
drawn
about
her
brow
was
this
painful
parting
to
be
indeed
eternal
was
there
no
future
home
for
the
dead
of
this
world
should
the
bands
of
love
and
friendship
thus
rudely
severed
be
renewed
no
more
was
there
no
land
where
the
broken
links
might
be
gathered
up
again
what
did
philosophy
say
of
these
grim
hours
of
struggle
and
separation
nothing
absolutely
nothing
was
she
to
see
her
sister
no
more
was
a
moldering
mass
of
dust
all
that
remained
of
the
darling
dead
the
beautiful
angel
lilly
whom
she
had
so
idolized
oh
was
life
then
a
great
mockery
and
the
soul
with
its
noble
aims
and
impulses
but
a
delicate
machine
of
matter
her
brain
was
in
a
wild
maddening
whirl
she
could
not
weep
her
eyes
were
dry
and
burning
cornelia
moved
an
instant
and
murmured
audibly
here
we
have
no
continuing
city
but
seek
one
to
come
ah
what
is
its
name
that
city
necropolis
again
she
remained
for
some
time
speechless
hartwell
softly
wiped
away
the
glistening
drops
on
her
brow
and
opening
her
eyes
she
looked
up
at
him
intently
it
was
an
imploring
gaze
which
mutely
said
ca
you
help
me
he
leaned
over
and
answered
it
sadly
enough
courage
cornelia
it
will
very
soon
be
over
now
the
worst
is
past
my
friend
yes
i
know
there
is
a
chill
creeping
over
me
where
is
eugene
he
came
and
stood
near
her
his
face
full
of
anguish
which
could
not
vent
itself
in
tears
her
features
became
convulsed
as
she
looked
at
him
a
wailing
cry
broke
from
her
lips
and
extending
her
arms
toward
him
she
said
sobbingly
shall
i
see
you
no
more
no
more
oh
eugene
my
brother
my
pride
my
dearest
hope
whom
i
have
loved
better
than
my
own
life
are
we
now
parted
forever
forever
he
laid
her
head
on
his
bosom
and
endeavored
to
soothe
her
but
clinging
to
him
she
said
huskily
eugene
with
my
last
breath
i
implore
you
forsake
your
intemperate
companions
shun
them
and
their
haunts
let
me
die
feeling
that
at
least
my
dying
prayer
will
save
you
oh
when
i
am
gone
when
i
am
silent
in
the
graveyard
remember
how
the
thought
of
your
intemperance
tortured
me
remember
how
i
remonstrated
and
entreated
you
not
to
ruin
yourself
remember
that
i
loved
you
above
everything
on
earth
and
that
in
my
last
hour
i
prayed
you
to
save
yourself
oh
eugene
for
my
sake
for
my
sake
quit
the
and
leave
drunkenness
for
others
more
degraded
promise
me
where
are
you
oh
it
is
all
cold
and
dark
i
ca
see
you
eugene
promise
promise
eugene
her
eyes
were
riveted
on
his
and
her
lips
moved
for
some
seconds
then
the
clasping
arms
gradually
relaxed
the
gasps
ceased
eugene
felt
a
long
shudder
creep
over
the
limbs
a
deep
heavy
sigh
passed
her
lips
and
cornelia
graham
soul
was
with
its
god
ah
after
years
of
hope
and
fear
struggling
and
questioning
what
an
exit
eugene
lifted
the
attenuated
form
and
placed
it
on
the
bed
then
threw
himself
into
her
vacant
chair
and
sobbed
like
a
child
graham
took
his
wife
from
the
room
and
after
some
minutes
hartwell
touched
the
kneeling
figure
with
the
face
still
pressed
against
the
chair
eugene
now
occupied
come
beulah
she
will
want
you
no
more
she
lifted
a
countenance
so
full
of
woe
that
as
he
looked
at
her
the
moisture
gathered
in
his
eyes
and
he
put
his
hand
tenderly
on
her
head
saying
come
with
me
beulah
and
this
is
death
oh
my
god
save
me
from
such
a
death
she
clasped
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
shivered
then
rising
from
her
kneeling
posture
threw
herself
on
a
couch
and
buried
her
face
in
its
cushions
that
long
night
of
was
never
forgotten
the
day
of
the
funeral
was
cold
dark
and
dismal
a
january
wind
howled
through
the
streets
and
occasional
drizzling
showers
enhanced
the
gloom
the
parlors
and
sitting
room
were
draped
and
on
the
marble
slab
of
one
of
the
tables
stood
the
coffin
covered
with
a
velvet
pall
once
before
beulah
had
entered
a
room
similarly
shrouded
and
it
seemed
but
yesterday
that
she
stood
beside
rigid
form
she
went
in
alone
and
waited
some
moments
near
the
coffin
striving
to
calm
the
wild
tumult
of
conflicting
sorrows
in
her
oppressed
heart
then
lifted
the
covering
and
looked
on
the
sleeper
wan
waxen
and
silent
no
longer
the
fitful
sleep
of
disease
nor
the
refreshing
slumber
of
health
but
the
still
iciness
of
ruthless
death
the
black
locks
were
curled
around
the
forehead
and
the
beautiful
hands
folded
peacefully
over
the
heart
that
should
throb
no
more
with
the
anguish
of
earth
death
had
smoothed
the
brow
and
put
the
trembling
mouth
at
rest
and
every
feature
was
in
repose
in
life
she
had
never
looked
so
placidly
beautiful
what
availed
all
her
inquiries
and
longings
and
defiant
cries
she
died
no
nearer
the
truth
than
when
she
began
she
died
without
hope
and
without
knowledge
only
death
could
unseal
the
mystery
thought
beulah
as
she
looked
at
the
marble
face
and
recalled
the
bitterness
of
its
lifelong
expression
persons
began
to
assemble
gradually
the
rooms
filled
beulah
bent
down
and
kissed
the
cold
lips
for
the
last
time
and
lowering
her
veil
retired
to
a
dim
corner
she
was
very
miserable
but
her
eyes
were
tearless
and
she
sat
she
knew
not
how
long
unconscious
of
what
passed
around
her
she
heard
the
stifled
sobs
of
the
bereaved
parents
as
in
a
painful
dream
and
when
the
solemn
silence
was
broken
she
started
and
saw
a
venerable
man
a
stranger
standing
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
and
these
words
fell
upon
her
ears
like
a
message
from
another
world
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
saith
the
lord
and
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
cornelia
had
not
believed
was
she
utterly
lost
beulah
asked
herself
this
question
and
shrank
from
the
answer
she
did
not
believe
would
she
die
as
cornelia
died
without
comfort
was
there
but
one
salvation
when
the
coffin
was
borne
out
and
the
procession
formed
she
went
on
mechanically
and
found
herself
seated
in
a
carriage
with
asbury
and
her
two
daughters
she
sank
back
in
one
corner
and
the
long
line
of
carriages
extending
for
many
squares
slowly
wound
through
the
streets
the
wind
wailed
and
sobbed
as
if
in
sympathy
and
the
rain
drizzled
against
the
window
glass
when
the
procession
reached
the
cemetery
it
was
too
wet
to
think
of
leaving
the
carriages
but
beulah
could
see
the
coffin
borne
from
the
hearse
and
heard
the
subdued
voice
of
the
minister
and
when
the
shrouded
form
of
the
only
child
was
lowered
into
its
final
she
groaned
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
should
they
meet
no
more
hitherto
asbury
had
forborne
to
address
her
but
now
she
passed
her
arm
round
the
shuddering
form
and
said
gently
my
dear
beulah
do
not
look
so
hopelessly
wretched
in
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death
but
god
has
given
a
promise
to
cheer
us
all
in
sad
scenes
like
this
john
was
told
to
write
henceforth
blessed
are
the
dead
who
die
in
the
lord
for
they
rest
from
their
labors
and
do
you
think
she
is
lost
forever
because
she
did
not
believe
do
you
can
you
cried
beulah
vehemently
beulah
she
had
the
bible
which
promises
eternal
life
if
she
entirely
rejected
it
she
did
so
voluntarily
and
deliberately
but
only
god
knows
the
heart
only
her
maker
can
judge
her
i
trust
that
even
in
the
last
hour
the
mists
rolled
from
her
mind
beulah
knew
better
but
said
nothing
it
was
enough
to
have
witnessed
that
darkened
soul
last
hour
on
earth
as
the
carriage
stopped
at
her
door
asbury
said
my
dear
beulah
stay
with
me
i
think
i
can
help
you
to
find
what
you
are
seeking
so
earnestly
beulah
shrank
back
and
answered
no
no
no
one
can
help
me
i
must
help
myself
some
other
time
i
will
come
the
rain
fell
heavily
as
she
reached
her
own
home
and
she
went
to
her
room
with
a
heaviness
of
heart
almost
unendurable
she
sat
down
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
and
threw
her
arms
up
over
a
chair
as
she
was
wont
to
do
in
childhood
and
as
she
remembered
that
the
winter
rain
now
beat
pitilessly
on
the
grave
of
one
who
had
never
known
privation
nor
aught
of
grief
that
wealth
could
shield
her
from
she
moaned
bitterly
what
lamp
had
philosophy
hung
in
the
sable
chambers
of
the
tomb
the
soul
was
impotent
to
explain
its
origin
how
then
could
it
possibly
read
the
riddle
of
final
destiny
psychologists
had
wrangled
for
ages
over
the
question
of
were
infants
born
with
or
without
them
did
ideas
arise
or
develop
them
selves
independently
of
experience
the
affirmation
or
denial
of
this
proposition
alone
distinguished
the
numerous
schools
which
had
so
long
wrestled
with
psychology
and
if
this
were
insolvable
how
could
human
intellect
question
further
could
it
bridge
the
gulf
of
death
and
explore
the
shores
of
eternity
chapter
xxxi
time
like
a
star
unhasting
yet
unresting
moved
on
the
keen
blasts
of
winter
were
gathered
back
in
their
northern
storehouses
and
the
mild
airs
of
spring
floated
dreamily
beneath
genial
skies
the
day
had
been
cloudless
and
balmy
but
now
the
long
level
rays
of
sunshine
darting
from
the
horizon
told
it
was
done
and
beulah
sat
on
the
steps
of
her
cottage
home
and
watched
the
death
the
regal
splendors
of
southern
springtime
were
on
every
side
the
bright
fresh
green
of
the
grassy
common
with
its
long
velvety
slopes
where
the
sunshine
fell
slantingly
the
wild
luxuriance
of
the
cherokee
rose
hedges
with
their
graceful
streamers
gleaming
with
the
snow
powder
of
blossoms
the
waving
of
newborn
foliage
the
whir
and
chirping
of
birds
as
they
sought
their
leafy
shelters
brilliant
patches
of
verbena
like
flakes
of
rainbow
in
the
neighboring
gardens
and
the
faint
sweet
odor
of
violet
jasmine
roses
and
honeysuckle
burdening
the
air
beulah
sat
with
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
an
open
book
lay
before
her
a
volume
of
euskin
but
the
eyes
had
wandered
away
from
his
gorgeous
descriptions
to
another
and
still
more
entrancing
volume
the
glorious
page
of
nature
and
as
the
swift
southern
twilight
gathered
she
sat
looking
out
mute
and
motionless
the
distant
pinetops
sang
their
solemn
soothing
lullaby
and
a
new
moon
sat
royally
in
the
soft
violet
sky
around
the
columns
of
the
little
portico
a
luxuriant
wistaria
clambered
and
long
purple
blossoms
with
their
spicy
fragrance
drooped
almost
on
beulah
head
as
she
leaned
it
against
the
pillar
the
face
wore
a
weary
suffering
look
the
large
restless
eyes
were
sadder
than
ever
and
there
were
tokens
of
languor
in
every
feature
a
few
months
had
strangely
changed
the
countenance
once
so
hopeful
and
courageous
in
its
uplifted
expression
the
wasted
form
bore
evidence
of
physical
suffering
and
the
slender
fingers
were
like
those
of
a
marble
statue
yet
she
had
never
missed
an
hour
in
the
schoolroom
nor
omitted
one
iota
of
the
usual
routine
of
mental
labor
rigorously
the
tax
was
levied
no
matter
how
the
weary
limbs
ached
or
how
painfully
the
head
throbbed
and
now
nature
rebelled
at
the
unremitted
exaction
and
clamored
for
a
reprieve
williams
had
been
confined
to
her
room
for
many
days
by
an
attack
of
rheumatism
and
the
time
devoted
to
her
was
generally
reclaimed
from
sleep
it
was
no
mystery
that
she
looked
ill
and
spent
now
as
she
sat
watching
the
silver
crescent
glittering
in
the
vest
her
thoughts
wandered
to
clara
sanders
and
the
last
letter
received
from
her
telling
of
a
glorious
of
hope
which
had
risen
in
her
cloudy
sky
arlington
brother
had
taught
her
that
the
dream
of
her
girlhood
was
but
a
fleeting
fancy
that
she
could
love
again
more
truly
than
before
and
in
the
summer
holidays
she
was
to
give
him
her
hand
and
receive
his
name
beulah
rejoiced
in
her
friend
happiness
but
a
dim
foreboding
arose
lest
as
in
pauline
case
thorns
should
spring
up
in
paths
where
now
only
blossoms
were
visible
since
that
letter
so
full
of
complaint
and
sorrow
no
tidings
had
come
from
pauline
many
months
had
elapsed
and
beulah
wondered
more
and
more
at
the
prolonged
silence
she
had
written
several
times
but
received
no
answer
and
imagination
painted
a
wretched
young
wife
in
that
distant
parsonage
early
in
spring
she
learned
from
asbury
that
lockhart
had
died
at
his
plantation
of
consumption
and
she
conjectured
that
lockhart
must
be
with
her
daughter
beulah
half
rose
then
leaned
back
against
the
column
sighed
involuntarily
and
listened
to
that
still
small
voice
of
the
level
twilight
behind
purple
hills
williams
was
asleep
but
the
tea
table
waited
for
her
and
in
her
own
room
on
her
desk
lay
an
unfinished
manuscript
which
was
due
the
editor
the
next
morning
she
was
rigidly
punctual
in
handing
in
her
contributions
cost
her
what
it
might
yet
now
she
shrank
from
the
task
of
copying
and
punctuating
and
sat
a
while
longer
with
the
gentle
southern
breeze
rippling
over
her
hot
brow
she
no
longer
wrote
incognito
by
accident
she
was
discovered
as
the
authoress
of
several
articles
commented
upon
by
other
journals
and
more
than
once
her
humble
home
had
been
visited
by
some
of
the
leading
literati
of
the
place
her
successful
career
thus
far
inflamed
the
ambition
which
formed
so
powerful
an
element
in
her
mental
organization
and
a
longing
desire
for
fame
took
possession
of
her
soul
early
and
late
she
toiled
one
article
was
scarcely
in
the
hands
of
the
compositor
ere
she
was
engaged
upon
another
she
lived
as
it
were
in
a
perpetual
brain
fever
and
her
physical
frame
suffered
proportionably
the
little
gate
opened
and
closed
with
a
creaking
sound
and
hearing
a
step
near
her
beulah
looked
up
and
saw
her
guardian
before
her
the
light
from
the
dining
room
fell
on
his
face
and
a
glance
showed
her
that
although
it
was
pale
and
inflexible
as
ever
something
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
had
induced
this
visit
he
had
never
entered
that
gate
before
and
she
sprang
up
and
held
out
both
hands
with
an
eager
cry
oh
sir
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
once
more
he
took
her
hands
in
his
and
looked
at
her
gravely
then
made
her
sit
down
again
on
the
step
and
said
i
suppose
you
would
have
died
before
you
could
get
your
consent
to
send
for
me
it
is
well
that
you
have
somebody
to
look
after
you
how
long
have
you
had
this
fever
fever
why
sir
i
have
no
fever
she
replied
with
some
surprise
oh
child
are
you
trying
to
destroy
yourself
by
your
obstinacy
if
so
like
most
other
things
you
undertake
i
suppose
you
will
succeed
he
held
her
hands
and
kept
his
finger
on
the
quick
bounding
pulse
beulah
had
not
seen
him
since
the
night
of
cornelia
death
some
months
before
and
conjectured
that
asbury
had
told
him
she
was
not
looking
well
she
could
not
bear
the
steady
searching
gaze
of
his
luminous
eyes
and
moving
restlessly
said
sir
what
induces
you
to
suppose
that
i
am
sick
i
have
complained
of
indisposition
to
no
one
of
course
you
have
not
for
people
are
to
believe
that
you
are
a
automaton
she
fancied
his
tone
was
slightly
sneering
but
his
countenance
wore
the
expression
of
anxious
protecting
interest
which
she
had
so
prized
in
days
past
and
as
her
hands
trembled
in
his
clasp
and
his
firm
hold
tightened
she
felt
that
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
conceal
the
truth
longer
i
did
know
i
was
feverish
but
for
some
time
i
have
daily
grown
weaker
i
tremble
when
i
stand
or
walk
and
am
not
able
to
sleep
that
is
all
he
smiled
down
at
her
earnest
face
and
asked
is
that
all
child
is
that
all
yes
sir
all
and
here
you
have
been
with
a
continued
wasting
nervous
fever
for
you
know
not
how
many
days
yet
keep
on
your
round
of
labors
without
cessation
he
dropped
her
hands
and
folded
his
arms
across
his
broad
chest
keeping
his
eyes
upon
her
i
am
not
at
all
ill
but
believe
i
need
some
medicine
to
strengthen
me
yes
child
you
do
indeed
need
a
medicine
but
it
is
one
you
will
never
take
try
me
sir
answered
she
smiling
try
you
i
might
as
well
try
to
win
an
eagle
from
its
lonely
rocky
home
beulah
you
need
rest
rest
for
mind
body
and
heart
but
you
will
not
take
it
oh
no
of
course
you
wo
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
brow
and
swept
back
the
glossy
chestnut
hair
as
if
it
oppressed
him
i
would
willingly
take
it
sir
if
i
could
but
the
summer
vacation
is
still
distant
and
besides
my
engagements
oblige
me
to
exert
myself
it
is
a
necessity
with
me
rather
say
sheer
obstinacy
said
he
sternly
you
are
severe
sir
replied
beulah
lifting
her
head
haughtily
no
i
only
call
things
by
their
proper
names
very
well
if
you
prefer
it
then
obstinacy
compels
me
just
now
to
deny
myself
the
rest
you
prescribe
yes
rightly
spoken
and
it
will
soon
compel
you
to
a
long
rest
in
the
quiet
place
where
cornelia
waits
for
you
you
are
a
mere
shadow
now
and
a
few
more
months
will
complete
your
design
i
have
blamed
myself
more
than
once
that
i
did
not
suffer
you
to
die
with
lilly
as
you
certainly
would
have
done
had
i
not
tended
you
so
closely
your
death
then
would
have
saved
me
much
care
and
sorrow
and
you
many
struggles
there
was
a
shadow
on
his
face
and
his
voice
had
the
deep
musical
tone
which
always
made
her
heart
thrill
her
eyelids
drooped
as
she
said
sadly
you
are
unjust
we
meet
rarely
enough
heaven
knows
why
do
you
invariably
make
these
occasions
seasons
of
upbraiding
of
taunts
and
sneers
sir
i
owe
you
my
life
and
more
than
my
life
and
never
can
i
forget
or
cancel
my
obligations
but
are
you
no
longer
my
friend
his
whole
face
lighted
up
the
firm
mouth
trembled
no
beulah
i
am
no
longer
your
friend
she
looked
up
at
him
and
a
quiver
crept
across
her
lips
she
had
never
seen
that
eager
expression
in
his
stern
face
before
his
dark
fascinating
eyes
were
full
of
pleading
tenderness
and
as
she
drooped
her
head
on
her
lap
she
knew
that
clara
was
right
that
she
was
dearer
to
her
guardian
than
anyone
else
a
groan
escaped
her
and
there
was
a
short
pause
hartwell
put
his
hands
gently
on
her
bowed
head
and
lifted
the
face
child
does
it
surprise
you
she
said
nothing
and
leaning
her
head
against
him
as
she
had
often
done
years
before
he
passed
his
hand
caressingly
over
the
folds
of
hair
and
added
you
call
me
your
guardian
make
me
such
i
can
no
longer
be
only
your
friend
i
must
either
be
more
or
henceforth
a
stranger
my
life
has
been
full
of
sorrow
and
bitterness
but
you
can
bring
sunlight
to
my
home
and
heart
you
were
too
proud
to
be
adopted
once
i
asked
you
to
be
my
child
ah
i
did
not
know
my
own
heart
then
our
separation
during
the
season
first
taught
me
how
inexpressibly
dear
you
were
to
me
how
entirely
you
filled
my
heart
now
i
ask
you
to
be
my
wife
to
give
yourself
to
me
oh
beulah
come
back
to
my
cheerless
home
best
your
lonely
heart
my
proud
darling
impossible
do
not
ask
it
i
can
not
i
can
not
cried
beulah
shuddering
violently
why
not
my
little
beulah
he
clasped
his
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
close
to
him
while
his
head
was
bent
so
low
that
his
brown
hair
touched
her
cheek
oh
sir
i
would
rather
die
i
should
be
miserable
as
your
wife
you
do
not
love
me
sir
you
are
lonely
and
miss
my
presence
in
your
house
but
that
is
not
love
and
marriage
would
be
a
mockery
you
would
despise
a
wife
who
was
such
only
from
gratitude
do
not
ask
this
of
me
we
would
both
be
wretched
you
pity
my
loneliness
and
poverty
and
i
reverence
you
nay
more
i
love
you
sir
as
my
best
friend
i
love
you
as
my
protector
you
are
all
i
have
on
earth
to
look
to
for
sympathy
and
guidance
you
are
all
i
have
but
i
can
not
marry
you
oh
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
she
shrank
away
from
the
touch
of
his
lips
on
her
brow
and
an
expression
of
hopeless
suffering
settled
upon
her
face
he
withdrew
his
arm
and
rose
beulah
i
have
seen
sunlit
bubbles
gliding
swiftly
on
the
bosom
of
a
clear
brook
and
casting
golden
shadows
down
upon
the
pebbly
bed
such
a
shadow
you
are
now
chasing
ah
child
the
shadow
of
a
gilded
bubble
panting
and
eager
you
clutch
at
it
the
bubble
dances
on
the
shadow
with
it
and
beulah
you
will
never
never
grasp
it
ambition
such
as
yours
which
aims
at
literary
fame
is
the
deadliest
foe
to
happiness
man
may
content
himself
with
the
applause
of
the
world
and
the
homage
paid
to
his
intellect
but
woman
heart
has
holier
idols
you
cue
young
and
impulsive
and
aspiring
and
fame
beckons
you
on
like
the
siren
of
antiquity
but
the
months
and
years
will
surely
come
when
with
wasted
energies
and
embittered
heart
you
are
left
to
mourn
your
infatuation
i
would
save
you
from
this
but
you
will
drain
the
very
dregs
rather
than
forsake
your
tempting
fiend
for
such
is
ambition
to
the
female
heart
yes
you
will
spend
the
springtime
of
your
life
chasing
a
painted
specter
and
go
down
to
a
premature
grave
disappointed
and
miserable
poor
child
it
needs
no
prophetic
vision
to
predict
your
career
already
the
consuming
fever
has
begun
its
march
in
lands
i
shall
have
no
tidings
of
you
but
none
will
be
needed
perhaps
when
i
travel
home
to
die
your
feverish
dream
will
have
ended
or
perchance
sinking
to
eternal
rest
in
some
palm
grove
of
the
far
east
we
shall
meet
no
more
since
the
day
i
took
you
in
my
arms
from
lilly
coffin
you
have
been
my
only
hope
my
all
you
little
knew
how
precious
you
were
to
me
nor
what
keen
suffering
our
estrangement
cost
me
oh
child
i
have
loved
you
as
only
a
strong
suffering
passionate
heart
could
love
its
last
idol
but
i
too
chased
a
shadow
experience
should
have
taught
me
wisdom
now
i
am
a
gloomy
joyless
man
weary
of
my
home
and
henceforth
a
wanderer
asbury
if
he
lives
will
be
truly
your
friend
and
to
him
t
shall
commit
the
legacy
which
hitherto
you
have
refused
to
accept
graham
paid
it
into
my
hands
after
his
last
unsatisfactory
interview
with
you
the
day
may
come
when
you
will
need
it
i
shall
send
you
some
medicine
which
for
your
own
sake
you
had
better
take
immediately
but
you
will
never
grow
stronger
until
you
give
yourself
rest
relaxation
physically
and
mentally
remember
when
your
health
is
broken
and
all
your
hopes
withered
remember
i
warned
you
and
would
have
saved
you
and
you
would
not
he
stooped
and
took
his
hat
from
the
floor
beulah
sat
looking
at
him
stunned
bewildered
her
tearless
eyes
strained
and
frightened
in
their
expression
the
transient
illumination
in
his
face
had
faded
like
sunset
tints
leaving
dull
leaden
clouds
behind
his
compressed
lips
were
firm
again
and
the
misty
eyes
became
coldly
glittering
as
one
sees
stars
brighten
in
a
frosty
air
he
put
on
his
hat
and
they
looked
at
each
other
fixedly
you
are
not
in
earnest
you
are
not
going
to
quit
your
home
cried
beulah
in
a
broken
unsteady
tone
yes
going
into
the
far
east
to
the
ruined
altars
of
baalbec
to
meroe
to
tartary
india
china
and
only
fate
knows
where
else
perhaps
find
a
cool
nebo
in
some
himalayan
range
going
yes
did
you
suppose
i
meant
only
to
operate
on
your
sympathies
i
know
you
too
well
what
is
it
to
you
whether
i
live
or
die
whether
my
weary
feet
rest
in
an
indian
jungle
or
on
a
sunny
slope
of
the
city
cemetery
yes
i
am
going
very
soon
and
this
is
our
last
meeting
i
shall
not
again
disturb
you
in
your
ambitious
pursuits
ah
child
oh
do
go
do
leave
me
i
beg
i
implore
you
not
to
leave
me
oh
i
am
so
desolate
do
forsake
me
i
could
not
bear
to
know
you
were
gone
oh
do
leave
me
she
sprang
up
and
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
clung
to
him
trembling
like
a
frightened
child
but
there
was
no
relaxation
of
his
pale
fixed
features
as
he
coldly
answered
once
resolved
i
never
waver
so
surely
as
i
live
i
shall
go
it
might
have
been
otherwise
but
you
decided
it
yourself
an
hour
ago
you
held
my
destiny
in
your
hands
now
it
is
fixed
i
should
have
gone
six
years
since
had
i
not
indulged
a
lingering
hope
of
happiness
in
your
love
child
do
shiver
and
cling
to
me
so
oceans
will
soon
roll
between
us
and
for
a
time
you
will
have
no
leisure
to
regret
my
absence
henceforth
we
are
strangers
no
that
shall
never
be
you
do
not
mean
it
you
know
it
is
impossible
you
know
that
i
prize
your
friendship
above
every
earthly
thing
you
know
that
i
look
up
to
you
as
to
no
one
else
that
i
shall
be
miserable
oh
how
miserable
if
you
leave
me
oh
sir
i
have
mourned
over
your
coldness
and
indifference
do
cast
me
off
do
go
to
distant
lands
and
leave
me
to
struggle
without
aid
or
counsel
in
this
selfish
unfriendly
world
my
heart
dies
within
me
at
the
thought
of
your
being
where
i
shall
not
be
able
to
see
you
oh
my
guardian
do
forsake
me
she
pressed
her
face
against
his
shoulder
and
clasped
her
arms
firmly
round
his
neck
i
am
not
your
guardian
beulah
you
refused
to
make
me
such
you
are
a
proud
ambitious
woman
solicitous
only
to
secure
eminence
as
an
authoress
i
asked
your
heart
you
have
now
none
to
give
but
perhaps
some
day
you
will
love
me
as
devotedly
nay
as
madly
as
i
have
long
loved
you
for
love
like
mine
would
wake
affection
even
in
a
marble
image
but
then
rolling
oceans
and
trackless
deserts
will
divide
us
and
now
make
yourself
a
name
bind
your
aching
brow
with
the
chaplet
of
fame
and
see
if
ambition
can
fill
your
heart
dear
child
gently
he
drew
her
arms
from
his
neck
and
took
her
face
in
his
soft
palms
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
sadly
and
earnestly
as
if
striving
to
fix
her
features
in
the
frame
of
memory
then
bent
his
head
and
pressed
a
long
kiss
on
her
lips
she
put
out
her
hands
but
he
had
gone
and
sinking
down
on
the
step
she
hid
her
face
in
her
arms
a
pall
seemed
suddenly
thrown
over
the
future
and
the
orphaned
heart
shrank
back
from
the
lonely
path
where
only
specters
were
visible
never
before
had
she
realized
how
dear
he
was
to
her
how
large
a
share
of
her
love
he
possessed
and
now
the
prospect
of
a
long
perhaps
final
separation
filled
her
with
a
shivering
horrible
dread
we
have
seen
that
was
a
powerful
element
in
her
character
and
she
had
learned
from
painful
necessity
to
depend
as
little
as
possible
upon
the
sympathies
of
others
but
in
this
hour
of
anguish
a
sense
of
joyless
isolation
conquered
her
proud
soul
bowed
down
beneath
the
weight
of
intolerable
grief
and
acknowledged
itself
not
wholly
independent
of
the
love
and
presence
of
her
guardian
beulah
went
back
to
her
desk
and
with
tearless
eyes
began
the
allotted
task
of
writing
the
article
was
due
and
must
be
finished
was
there
not
a
long
dark
future
in
which
to
mourn
the
sketch
was
designed
to
prove
that
woman
happiness
was
not
necessarily
dependent
on
marriage
that
a
single
life
might
be
more
useful
more
tranquil
more
unselfish
beulah
had
painted
her
heroine
in
glowing
tints
and
triumphantly
proved
her
theory
correct
while
to
female
influence
she
awarded
a
sphere
exclusive
of
rostrums
and
all
political
arenas
wide
as
the
universe
and
high
as
heaven
weary
work
it
all
seemed
to
her
now
but
she
wrote
on
and
on
and
finally
the
last
page
was
copied
and
the
last
punctuation
mark
affixed
she
wrapped
up
the
manuscript
directed
it
to
the
editor
and
then
the
pen
fell
from
her
nerveless
fingers
and
her
head
went
down
with
a
wailing
cry
on
her
desk
there
the
morning
sun
flashed
upon
a
white
face
and
full
of
keen
anguish
how
her
readers
would
have
marveled
at
the
sight
ah
verily
the
heart
knoweth
its
own
bitterness
chapter
xxxii
one
afternoon
in
the
following
week
williams
sat
wrapped
up
in
the
hall
watching
beulah
movements
in
the
yard
at
the
rear
of
the
house
the
whitewashed
paling
was
covered
with
luxuriant
raspberry
vines
and
in
one
corner
of
the
garden
was
a
bed
of
strawberry
plants
over
this
bed
beulah
was
bending
with
a
basket
nearly
filled
with
the
ripe
scarlet
berries
stooping
close
to
the
plants
she
saw
only
the
fruit
she
was
engaged
in
picking
and
when
the
basket
was
quite
full
she
was
suddenly
startled
by
a
merry
laugh
and
a
pair
of
hands
clasped
over
her
eyes
who
blindfolds
me
said
she
guess
you
solemn
witch
why
georgia
of
course
the
hands
were
removed
and
georgia
asbury
merry
face
greeted
her
i
am
glad
to
see
you
georgia
where
is
helen
oh
gone
to
ride
with
one
of
her
adorers
but
i
have
brought
somebody
to
see
you
who
is
worth
the
whole
asbury
family
no
less
a
personage
than
my
famous
cousin
reginald
lindsay
whom
you
have
heard
us
speak
of
so
often
oh
how
tempting
those
luscious
berries
are
reginald
and
i
intend
to
stay
to
tea
and
father
will
perhaps
come
out
in
the
carriage
for
us
come
yonder
is
my
cousin
on
the
gallery
looking
at
you
and
pretending
to
talk
to
williams
he
has
read
your
magazine
sketches
and
is
very
anxious
to
see
you
how
nice
you
look
only
a
little
too
statuish
ca
you
get
up
a
smile
that
is
better
here
let
me
twine
this
cluster
of
wistaria
in
your
hair
i
stole
it
as
i
ran
up
the
steps
beulah
was
clad
in
a
pure
white
mull
muslin
and
wore
a
short
black
silk
apron
confined
at
the
waist
by
a
heavy
cord
and
tassel
georgia
fastened
the
purple
blossoms
in
her
silky
hair
and
they
entered
the
house
lindsay
met
them
and
as
his
cousin
introduced
him
beulah
looked
at
him
and
met
the
earnest
gaze
of
a
pair
of
deep
blue
eyes
which
seemed
to
index
a
nature
singularly
tranquil
she
greeted
him
quietly
and
would
have
led
the
way
to
the
front
of
the
house
but
georgia
threw
herself
down
on
the
steps
and
exclaimed
eagerly
do
let
us
stay
here
the
air
is
so
deliciously
sweet
and
cool
cousin
there
is
a
chair
beulah
you
and
i
will
stem
these
berries
at
once
so
that
they
may
be
ready
for
tea
she
took
the
basket
and
soon
their
fingers
were
stained
with
the
rosy
juice
of
the
fragrant
fruit
all
restraint
vanished
the
conversation
was
gay
and
spiced
now
and
then
with
repartees
which
elicited
georgia
birdish
laugh
and
banished
for
a
time
the
weary
joyless
expression
of
beulah
countenance
the
berries
were
finally
arranged
to
suit
georgia
taste
and
the
party
returned
to
the
little
parlor
here
beulah
was
soon
engaged
by
lindsay
in
the
discussion
of
some
of
the
leading
literary
questions
of
the
day
she
forgot
the
great
sorrow
that
brooded
over
her
heart
a
faint
pearly
glow
crept
into
her
cheeks
and
the
mouth
lost
its
expression
of
resolute
endurance
she
found
lindsay
highly
cultivated
in
his
tastes
polished
in
his
manners
and
possessed
of
rare
intellectual
attainments
while
the
utter
absence
of
egotism
and
pedantry
impressed
her
with
involuntary
admiration
extensive
travel
and
long
study
had
familiarized
him
with
almost
every
branch
of
science
and
department
of
literature
and
the
ease
and
grace
with
which
he
imparted
some
information
she
desired
respecting
the
european
schools
of
art
contrasted
favorably
with
the
confused
account
eugene
had
rendered
of
the
same
subject
she
remarked
a
singular
composure
of
countenance
voice
and
even
position
which
seemed
idiosyncratic
and
was
directly
opposed
to
the
stern
rigidity
and
cynicism
of
her
guardian
she
shrank
from
the
calm
steadfast
gaze
of
his
eyes
which
looked
into
hers
with
a
deep
yet
gentle
scrutiny
and
resolved
ere
the
close
of
the
evening
to
sound
him
concerning
some
of
the
philosophic
phases
of
the
age
had
he
escaped
the
upas
taint
of
skepticism
an
opportunity
soon
occurred
to
favor
her
wishes
for
chancing
to
allude
to
his
visit
to
rydal
mount
while
in
the
lake
region
of
england
the
transition
to
a
discussion
of
the
metaphysical
tone
of
the
excursion
was
quite
easy
you
seemed
disposed
like
howitt
to
accord
it
the
title
of
of
quakerism
said
lindsay
in
answer
to
a
remark
of
hers
concerning
its
tendency
it
is
a
fertile
theme
of
disputation
sir
and
since
critics
are
so
divided
in
their
verdicts
i
may
well
be
pardoned
an
opinion
which
so
many
passages
seem
to
sanction
if
quakerism
is
belief
in
inspiration
which
you
will
scarcely
deny
then
throughout
the
wordsworth
seems
its
apostle
no
he
stands
as
a
high
priest
in
the
temple
of
nature
and
calls
mankind
from
scientific
lore
to
offer
their
orisons
there
at
his
altar
and
receive
passively
the
teachings
of
the
material
universe
tells
us
meddling
intellect
misshapes
the
beauteous
forms
of
things
and
promises
in
nature
an
unerring
guide
and
teacher
of
truth
in
his
lines
on
revisiting
the
wye
he
declares
himself
well
pleased
to
recognize
in
nature
and
the
language
of
the
sense
the
anchor
of
my
purest
thoughts
the
nurse
the
guide
the
guardian
of
my
heart
and
soul
of
all
my
moral
being
quakerism
rejects
all
extraneous
aids
to
a
knowledge
of
god
a
silent
band
of
friends
sit
waiting
for
the
direct
inspiration
which
alone
can
impart
true
light
wordsworth
made
the
senses
the
appreciation
of
the
beauty
and
sublimity
of
the
universe
an
avenue
of
light
while
quakerism
according
to
the
doctrines
of
fox
and
his
early
followers
is
merely
a
form
of
mysticism
nearly
allied
to
the
of
plotinus
the
quaker
silences
his
reason
his
every
faculty
and
in
utter
passivity
waits
for
the
infusion
of
divine
light
into
his
mind
the
mystic
of
alexandria
as
far
as
possible
divests
his
intellect
of
all
personality
and
becomes
absorbed
in
the
infinite
intelligence
from
which
it
emanated
beulah
knitted
her
brows
and
answered
musingly
and
here
then
extremes
meet
to
know
god
we
must
be
god
mysticism
and
pantheism
link
hands
over
the
gulf
which
seemed
to
divide
them
miss
benton
is
this
view
of
the
subject
a
novel
one
said
he
looking
at
her
very
intently
no
a
singular
passage
in
the
literaria
suggested
it
to
me
long
ago
but
unwelcome
hints
are
rarely
accepted
you
know
why
unwelcome
in
this
case
she
looked
at
him
but
made
no
reply
and
none
was
needed
he
understood
why
and
said
quietly
yet
impressively
it
sets
the
seal
of
necessity
upon
revelation
not
the
mystical
intuitions
of
the
dreamers
who
would
fain
teach
of
continued
direct
inspiration
from
god
even
at
the
present
time
but
the
revelation
which
began
in
genesis
and
ended
with
john
on
patmos
the
very
absurdities
of
philosophy
are
the
most
potent
arguments
in
substantiating
the
claims
of
christianity
kant
theory
that
we
can
know
nothing
beyond
ourselves
gave
the
deathblow
to
philosophy
mysticism
contends
that
reason
only
darkens
the
mind
and
consequently
discarding
all
reasoning
processes
relies
upon
immediate
revelation
but
the
extravagances
of
swedenborg
and
even
of
george
fox
prove
the
fallacy
of
the
assumption
of
continued
inspiration
and
the
only
alternative
is
to
rest
upon
the
christian
revelation
which
has
successfully
defied
all
assaults
there
was
an
instantaneous
flash
of
joy
over
beulah
troubled
face
and
she
said
hastily
you
have
escaped
the
contagion
then
such
exemption
is
rare
nowadays
for
skepticism
broods
with
sable
wings
over
the
age
it
has
always
brooded
where
man
essayed
to
lift
the
veil
of
isis
to
elucidate
the
arcana
of
the
universe
to
solve
the
unsolvable
skepticism
is
the
disease
of
minds
which
christian
faith
alone
can
render
healthy
the
thrust
showed
she
was
not
invulnerable
but
before
she
could
reply
georgia
exclaimed
in
the
name
of
common
sense
reginald
what
are
you
discoursing
about
so
tiresomely
i
suppose
i
am
shamefully
stupid
but
i
understand
a
word
you
two
have
been
saying
when
father
and
beulah
get
on
such
dry
tedious
subjects
i
always
set
up
an
opposition
at
the
piano
which
in
this
instance
i
am
forced
to
do
from
sheer
necessity
she
raised
the
lid
of
the
piano
and
rattled
off
a
brilliant
overture
then
made
beulah
join
her
in
several
instrumental
duets
as
the
latter
rose
lindsay
said
somewhat
abruptly
i
believe
you
sing
my
cousins
have
been
extolling
your
voice
and
i
have
some
curiosity
to
hear
you
will
you
gratify
me
certainly
if
you
desire
it
she
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
at
the
perfect
nonchalance
of
his
manner
and
passing
her
fingers
over
the
keys
sang
a
beautiful
air
from
lucia
her
guest
listened
attentively
and
when
the
song
was
ended
approached
the
piano
and
said
with
some
interest
i
should
prefer
a
simple
ballad
if
you
will
favor
me
with
one
something
after
the
order
of
dale
beulah
he
hears
nothing
else
in
his
country
home
said
georgia
teasingly
he
smiled
but
did
not
contradict
her
and
beulah
sang
that
exquisite
ballad
why
do
summer
roses
fade
it
was
one
of
her
guardian
favorite
airs
and
now
his
image
was
associated
with
the
strain
ere
the
first
verse
was
finished
a
deep
rich
manly
voice
which
had
sometimes
echoed
through
the
study
seemed
again
to
join
hers
and
despite
her
efforts
her
own
tones
trembled
soon
after
beulah
took
her
place
at
the
tea
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
conversation
turned
on
the
delights
of
country
life
reginald
how
do
you
manage
to
amuse
yourself
in
that
little
town
of
yours
asked
georgia
drawing
the
bowl
of
strawberries
near
and
helping
him
bountifully
i
might
answer
that
i
had
passed
the
age
when
amusement
was
necessary
but
i
will
not
beg
your
question
so
completely
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
reside
in
town
my
office
is
there
and
during
the
day
when
not
absent
at
court
i
am
generally
in
my
office
but
evening
always
finds
me
at
home
once
there
i
have
endless
sources
of
amusement
my
mother
flowers
and
birds
my
farm
affairs
my
music
and
my
library
to
say
nothing
of
hunting
and
fishing
remember
georgia
that
as
a
class
lawyers
are
not
addicted
to
what
you
call
amusements
but
after
living
in
europe
and
traveling
so
much
i
should
think
that
plantation
would
be
horribly
dull
do
you
never
suffer
from
ennui
cut
off
as
you
are
from
all
society
ennui
is
a
disease
of
which
i
am
yet
happily
ignorant
but
for
my
mother
i
should
feel
the
need
of
society
in
a
great
measure
her
presence
supplies
it
i
shall
tell
you
no
more
cousin
mine
since
you
and
helen
are
to
spend
a
portion
of
your
summer
with
us
and
can
judge
for
yourselves
of
the
attractions
of
my
country
home
are
you
residing
near
mr
arlington
said
beulah
quite
near
his
plantation
adjoins
mine
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
no
but
i
have
a
friend
living
this
year
in
his
family
miss
sanders
is
governess
for
his
children
you
probably
know
her
yes
i
see
her
occasionally
report
says
she
is
soon
to
become
the
bride
of
richard
arlington
a
slight
smile
curved
his
lips
as
he
watched
beulah
countenance
she
offered
no
comment
and
he
perceived
that
the
on
dit
was
not
new
to
her
beulah
i
suppose
you
have
heard
of
hartwell
intended
journey
to
the
east
what
an
oddity
he
is
told
me
he
contemplated
renting
a
bungalow
somewhere
in
heathendom
and
turning
either
brahmin
or
parsee
he
had
not
quite
decided
which
he
has
sold
his
beautiful
place
to
the
farleys
the
greenhouse
plants
he
gave
to
mother
and
all
the
statuary
and
paintings
are
to
be
sent
to
us
until
his
return
which
can
not
be
predicted
with
any
certainty
father
frets
a
good
deal
over
this
freak
as
he
calls
it
and
says
the
doctor
had
much
better
stay
at
home
and
physic
the
sick
i
thought
it
was
a
sudden
whim
but
he
says
he
has
contemplated
the
trip
a
long
time
he
is
going
immediately
i
believe
it
must
be
a
trial
to
you
said
the
thoughtless
girl
yes
i
can
not
realize
it
yet
replied
beulah
struggling
with
herself
for
composure
and
hastily
setting
down
her
teacup
which
trembled
violently
the
shadows
swept
over
her
once
more
lindsay
noticed
her
agitation
and
with
delicate
consideration
forbore
to
look
at
her
georgia
continued
heedlessly
i
wanted
that
melodeon
that
sits
in
his
study
but
though
the
remainder
of
the
furniture
is
to
be
auctioned
off
he
says
he
will
not
sell
the
melodeon
and
requested
my
father
to
have
it
carefully
locked
up
somewhere
at
home
i
asked
if
i
might
not
use
it
and
what
do
you
suppose
he
said
that
i
might
have
his
grand
piano
if
i
would
accept
it
but
that
nobody
was
to
touch
his
melodeon
i
told
him
he
ought
to
send
the
piano
out
to
you
in
his
absence
but
he
looked
cross
and
said
you
would
not
use
it
if
he
did
poor
beulah
her
lips
quivered
and
her
fingers
clasped
each
other
tightly
but
she
said
nothing
just
then
she
heard
quick
step
in
the
hall
and
to
her
infinite
relief
he
entered
accompanied
by
helen
she
saw
that
though
his
manner
was
kind
and
bantering
as
usual
there
was
an
anxious
look
on
his
benevolent
face
and
his
heavy
brows
occasionally
knitted
when
he
went
into
the
adjoining
room
to
see
williams
she
understood
his
glance
and
followed
him
he
paused
in
the
hall
and
said
eagerly
has
hartwell
been
here
lately
yes
he
was
here
last
week
did
he
tell
you
of
his
whim
about
traveling
east
yes
he
told
me
beulah
take
care
what
you
are
about
you
are
working
mischief
not
easily
rectified
child
keep
guy
at
home
he
is
master
of
his
own
movements
and
you
know
his
stubborn
will
i
would
keep
him
here
if
i
could
but
i
have
no
influence
all
fiddlesticks
i
know
better
i
am
neither
a
bat
nor
a
mole
beulah
i
warn
you
i
beg
you
child
mind
how
you
act
once
entirely
estranged
all
the
steam
of
christendom
could
not
force
him
back
do
let
him
go
if
you
do
the
game
is
up
i
tell
you
now
you
will
repent
your
own
work
if
you
do
not
take
care
i
told
him
he
was
a
fool
to
leave
such
a
position
as
his
and
go
to
dodging
robbers
in
eastern
deserts
whereupon
he
looked
as
bland
and
impenetrable
as
if
i
had
compared
him
to
solomon
there
go
back
to
your
company
end
mind
what
i
say
do
let
guy
go
he
left
her
and
though
she
exerted
herself
to
entertain
her
guests
lindsay
saw
that
her
mind
was
troubled
and
her
heart
oppressed
he
endeavored
to
divert
her
thoughts
by
introducing
various
topics
and
she
talked
and
smiled
and
even
played
and
sang
yet
the
unlifting
cloud
lay
on
her
brow
the
evening
seemed
strangely
long
and
she
accompanied
her
visitors
to
the
door
with
a
sensation
of
relief
at
parting
lindsay
took
her
hand
and
said
in
a
low
voice
may
i
come
whenever
i
am
in
your
city
certainly
i
shall
be
pleased
to
see
you
when
you
have
leisure
she
replied
hurriedly
i
shall
avail
myself
of
your
permission
i
assure
you
she
had
often
heard
asbury
speak
with
fond
pride
of
this
nephew
and
as
eugene
had
also
frequently
mentioned
him
in
his
early
letters
from
heidelberg
she
felt
that
he
was
scarcely
a
stranger
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
term
to
her
his
parting
words
seemed
merely
polite
commonplace
forms
and
with
no
thought
of
a
future
acquaintance
she
dismissed
him
from
her
mind
which
was
too
painfully
preoccupied
to
dwell
upon
the
circumstances
of
his
visit
a
few
days
passed
and
one
saturday
morning
she
sat
in
the
dining
room
finishing
a
large
drawing
upon
which
she
had
for
months
expended
all
her
leisure
moments
it
was
designed
from
a
description
in
queen
mab
and
she
took
up
her
crayon
to
give
the
final
touch
when
heavy
steps
in
the
hall
arrested
her
attention
and
glancing
toward
the
door
she
saw
hal
hartwell
driver
with
a
wooden
box
on
his
shoulder
and
charon
by
his
side
the
latter
barked
with
delight
and
sprang
to
meet
the
girl
who
had
hastily
risen
how
do
you
do
miss
beulah
it
is
many
a
day
since
i
have
seen
you
and
you
look
worse
of
wear
too
have
been
sick
have
you
said
hal
sliding
the
box
down
on
the
floor
not
exactly
sick
but
not
so
well
as
usual
she
answered
passing
her
trembling
hands
over
the
dog
head
well
i
do
see
for
my
part
what
is
to
become
of
us
all
now
master
gone
gone
echoed
beulah
why
to
be
sure
he
started
to
the
plantation
yesterday
to
set
things
all
in
order
there
and
then
he
is
going
straight
on
to
new
york
the
house
looks
desolate
enough
and
i
feel
like
i
was
about
to
dig
my
own
grave
just
before
he
left
he
called
me
into
the
study
and
told
me
that
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
i
was
to
bring
charon
over
to
you
and
ask
you
to
keep
him
and
take
care
of
him
he
tried
to
unlock
the
collar
on
his
neck
but
somehow
the
key
would
not
turn
master
looked
dreadful
sad
when
he
patted
poor
char
head
and
let
the
brute
put
his
paws
on
his
shoulders
for
the
last
time
just
as
the
boat
pushed
off
he
called
to
me
to
be
sure
to
bring
him
to
you
so
here
he
is
and
miss
beulah
the
poor
fellow
seems
to
know
something
is
wrong
he
whined
all
night
and
ran
over
the
empty
house
this
morning
growling
and
snuffing
you
are
to
keep
him
till
master
comes
home
the
lord
only
knows
when
that
will
be
i
tried
to
find
out
but
he
looked
for
the
world
like
one
of
them
stone
faces
in
the
study
and
gave
me
no
satisfaction
miss
beulah
asbury
was
at
the
house
just
as
i
started
and
he
sent
over
this
box
to
you
told
me
to
tell
you
that
he
had
all
the
pictures
moved
to
his
house
but
had
not
room
to
hang
all
so
he
sent
one
over
for
you
to
take
care
of
shall
i
take
it
out
of
the
case
never
mind
hal
i
can
do
that
did
your
master
leave
no
other
message
for
me
was
there
no
note
she
leaned
heavily
on
a
chair
to
support
herself
none
that
i
know
of
except
that
you
must
be
kind
to
charon
i
have
no
time
to
spare
asbury
needs
me
so
miss
beulah
i
will
stop
some
day
when
i
am
passing
and
see
how
the
dog
comes
on
i
know
he
will
be
satisfied
with
you
the
faithful
servant
touched
his
hat
and
withdrew
the
storm
of
grief
could
no
longer
be
repressed
and
sinking
down
on
the
floor
beulah
clasped
her
arms
round
charon
neck
and
hid
her
face
in
his
soft
curling
hair
while
her
whole
frame
shook
with
convulsive
sobs
she
had
not
believed
her
guardian
would
leave
without
coming
again
and
had
confidently
expected
him
and
now
he
had
gone
perhaps
forever
at
best
for
many
years
she
might
never
see
him
again
and
this
thought
was
more
than
she
could
endure
the
proud
restraint
she
was
wont
to
impose
upon
her
feelings
all
vanished
and
in
her
despairing
sorrow
she
wept
and
moaned
as
she
had
never
done
before
even
when
lilly
was
taken
from
her
charon
crouched
close
to
her
with
a
mute
grief
clearly
written
in
his
sober
sagacious
countenance
and
each
clung
to
the
other
as
to
a
last
stay
and
solace
he
was
a
powerful
animal
with
huge
limbs
and
a
think
shaggy
covering
sable
as
midnight
without
a
speck
of
white
about
him
around
his
neck
was
a
silver
chain
supporting
a
broad
piece
of
plate
on
which
was
engraved
in
german
letters
the
single
word
hartwell
how
long
she
sat
there
beulah
knew
not
but
a
growl
roused
her
and
she
saw
williams
looking
sorrowfully
at
her
my
child
what
makes
you
moan
and
weep
so
bitterly
oh
because
i
am
so
miserable
because
i
have
lost
my
best
friend
my
only
friend
my
guardian
he
has
gone
gone
and
i
did
not
see
him
with
a
stifled
cry
her
face
went
down
again
the
matron
had
never
seen
her
so
unnerved
before
and
wondered
at
the
vehemence
of
her
grief
but
knew
her
nature
too
well
to
attempt
consolation
beulah
lifted
the
box
and
retired
to
her
own
room
followed
by
charon
securing
the
door
she
put
the
case
on
the
table
and
looked
at
it
wistfully
were
her
conjectures
her
hopes
correct
she
raised
the
lid
and
unwrapped
the
frame
and
there
was
the
noble
head
of
her
guardian
she
hung
the
portrait
on
a
hook
just
above
her
desk
and
then
stood
with
streaming
eyes
looking
up
at
it
it
had
been
painted
a
few
weeks
after
his
marriage
and
represented
him
in
the
full
morning
of
manhood
ere
his
heart
was
embittered
and
his
clear
brow
overshadowed
the
artist
had
suffered
a
ray
of
sunshine
to
fall
on
the
brown
hair
that
rippled
round
his
white
temples
with
careless
grace
there
was
no
mustache
to
shade
the
sculptured
lips
and
they
seemed
about
to
part
in
one
of
those
rare
fascinating
smiles
which
beulah
had
often
watched
for
in
vain
the
matchless
eyes
looked
down
at
her
with
brooding
tenderness
in
their
hazel
depths
and
now
seemed
to
question
her
uncontrollable
grief
yet
she
had
pained
him
had
in
part
caused
his
exile
from
the
home
of
his
youth
and
added
another
sorrow
to
those
which
now
veiled
that
peerless
face
in
gloom
he
had
placed
his
happiness
in
her
hands
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
she
looked
at
the
portrait
and
shuddered
and
moaned
she
loved
him
above
all
others
loved
him
as
a
child
adores
its
father
but
how
could
she
who
had
so
reverenced
him
consent
to
become
his
wife
besides
she
could
not
believe
he
loved
her
he
liked
her
pitied
her
isolation
and
orphanage
felt
the
need
of
her
society
and
wanted
her
always
in
his
home
but
she
could
not
realize
that
he
who
so
worshiped
beauty
could
possibly
love
her
it
was
all
like
a
hideous
dream
which
morning
would
dispel
but
there
was
the
reality
and
there
was
charon
looking
steadily
up
at
the
portrait
he
was
at
no
loss
to
recognize
oh
if
i
could
have
seen
him
once
more
if
he
had
parted
with
me
in
kindness
it
would
not
be
so
intolerable
but
to
remember
his
stern
sad
face
as
last
i
saw
it
oh
how
can
i
bear
it
i
to
have
it
haunting
me
through
life
like
a
horrible
specter
no
friendly
words
to
cherish
no
final
message
all
gloom
and
anger
oh
how
shall
i
bear
it
and
she
fell
on
charon
neck
and
wept
bitterly
chapter
xxxiii
in
the
early
days
of
summer
and
graham
left
the
city
for
one
of
the
fashionable
on
the
gulf
accompanied
by
antoinette
eugene
remained
on
some
pretext
of
business
but
promised
to
follow
in
a
short
time
the
week
subsequent
to
their
departure
saw
a
party
of
gentlemen
assembled
to
dine
at
his
house
the
long
afternoon
wore
away
still
they
sat
round
the
table
the
cloth
had
been
removed
and
only
wine
and
cigars
remained
bottle
after
bottle
was
emptied
and
finally
decanters
were
in
requisition
the
servants
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
looked
on
with
amused
expectancy
the
conversation
grew
loud
and
boisterous
now
and
then
flavored
with
oaths
twilight
came
on
the
shutters
were
closed
the
magnificent
chandelier
lighted
eugene
seized
a
crystal
ice
bowl
and
was
about
to
extract
a
lump
of
ice
when
it
fell
from
his
fingers
and
shivered
to
atoms
a
roar
of
laughter
succeeded
the
exploit
and
uncorking
a
fresh
bottle
of
champagne
he
demanded
a
song
already
a
few
of
the
guests
were
leaning
on
the
table
stupefied
but
several
began
the
strain
it
was
a
genuine
bacchanalian
ode
and
the
deafening
shout
rose
to
the
frescoed
ceiling
as
the
revelers
leaned
forward
and
touched
their
glasses
touched
did
i
say
it
were
better
written
clashed
there
was
a
ringing
chorus
as
crystal
met
crystal
glittering
fragments
flew
in
every
direction
down
ran
the
foaming
wine
thick
with
splintered
glass
on
the
rosewood
table
but
the
strain
was
kept
up
fresh
glasses
were
supplied
fresh
bottles
drained
the
waiters
looked
on
wondered
where
all
this
would
end
and
pointed
to
the
ruin
of
the
costly
service
the
brilliant
gaslight
shone
on
a
scene
of
recklessness
pitiable
indeed
all
were
young
men
and
except
eugene
all
unmarried
but
they
seemed
familiar
with
such
occasions
one
or
two
thoroughly
intoxicated
lay
with
their
heads
on
the
table
unconscious
of
what
passed
others
struggled
to
sit
upright
yet
the
shout
was
still
raised
from
time
to
time
fill
up
and
let
us
have
that
glorious
song
from
lucrezia
borgia
hey
proctor
cried
eugene
that
is
poor
fun
without
vincent
he
sings
it
equal
to
vestvali
fill
up
there
munroe
and
shake
up
cowdon
come
begin
and
he
raised
his
glass
with
a
disgusting
oath
and
was
about
to
commence
when
munroe
said
stammeringly
where
is
fred
anyhow
he
is
a
devilish
fine
fellow
for
a
frolic
i
why
gone
to
the
coast
with
graham
pretty
wife
he
is
all
devotion
they
waltz
and
ride
and
in
fine
he
is
her
admirer
par
excellence
stop
your
stupid
stammering
and
begin
eugene
half
rose
at
this
insulting
mention
of
his
wife
name
but
the
song
was
now
ringing
around
him
and
sinking
back
he
too
raised
his
unsteady
voice
again
and
again
the
words
were
madly
shouted
and
then
dashing
his
empty
glass
against
the
marble
mantel
proctor
swore
he
would
not
drink
another
drop
what
a
picture
of
degradation
disordered
hair
soiled
clothes
flushed
burning
cheeks
glaring
eyes
and
nerveless
hands
eugene
attempted
to
rise
but
fell
back
in
his
chair
tearing
off
his
cravat
which
seemed
to
suffocate
him
proctor
who
was
too
thoroughly
inured
to
such
excesses
to
feel
it
as
sensibly
as
the
remainder
of
the
party
laughed
brutally
and
kicking
over
a
chair
which
stood
in
his
way
grasped
his
host
by
the
arm
and
exclaimed
come
out
of
this
confounded
room
it
is
as
hot
as
a
furnace
and
let
us
have
a
ride
to
cool
us
come
munroe
and
cowdon
must
look
after
the
others
by
jove
graham
old
father
bacchus
himself
could
not
find
fault
with
your
cellar
come
each
took
a
cigar
from
the
stand
and
descended
to
the
front
door
where
a
light
buggy
was
waiting
the
conclusion
of
the
revel
it
was
a
cloudless
july
night
and
the
full
moon
poured
a
flood
of
silver
light
over
the
silent
earth
proctor
assisted
eugene
into
the
buggy
and
gathering
up
the
reins
seized
the
whip
gave
a
flourish
and
shout
and
off
sprang
the
spirited
horse
which
the
groom
could
with
difficulty
hold
until
the
riders
were
seated
now
graham
i
will
bet
a
couple
of
baskets
of
heidseick
that
my
royal
telegraph
will
make
the
first
mile
post
in
what
say
you
done
is
the
lowest
phew
telegraph
my
jewel
show
what
manner
of
flesh
you
are
made
of
now
then
out
with
your
watch
he
shook
the
reins
and
the
horse
rushed
forward
like
an
arrow
before
the
mile
post
was
reached
it
became
evident
that
telegraph
had
taken
the
game
entirely
out
of
his
master
hands
in
vain
the
reins
were
tightened
proctor
leaned
so
far
back
that
his
hat
fell
off
still
the
frantic
horse
sped
on
the
mile
post
flashed
by
but
eugene
could
barely
sit
erect
much
less
note
the
time
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings
the
whir
of
wheels
behind
gave
a
new
impetus
to
telegraph
flying
feet
they
were
near
a
point
in
the
road
where
an
alley
led
off
at
right
angles
and
thinking
doubtless
that
it
was
time
to
retrace
his
steps
the
horse
dashed
down
the
alley
heedless
of
proctor
efforts
to
restrain
him
and
turning
into
a
neighboring
street
rushed
back
toward
the
city
bareheaded
and
with
heavy
drops
of
perspiration
streaming
from
his
face
proctor
cursed
and
jerked
and
drew
the
useless
reins
on
went
telegraph
making
good
his
title
now
swerving
to
this
side
of
the
road
and
now
to
that
but
as
he
approached
a
mass
of
bricks
which
were
piled
on
one
side
of
the
street
near
the
foundations
of
a
new
building
the
moonlight
flashed
upon
a
piece
of
tin
in
the
sand
on
the
opposite
side
and
frightened
by
the
glitter
he
plunged
toward
the
bricks
the
wheels
struck
the
buggy
tilted
then
came
down
again
with
a
terrible
jolt
and
eugene
was
thrown
out
on
the
pile
proctor
was
jerked
over
the
dashboard
dragged
some
distance
and
finally
left
in
the
sand
while
telegraph
ran
on
to
the
stable
it
was
eleven
but
beulah
was
writing
in
her
own
room
and
through
the
open
window
heard
the
thundering
tramp
the
rattle
among
the
bricks
proctor
furious
curses
and
surmised
that
some
accident
had
happened
she
sprang
to
the
window
saw
the
buggy
just
as
it
was
wheeled
on
and
hoped
nothing
was
hurt
but
charon
who
slept
on
the
portico
leaped
over
the
paling
ran
around
the
bricks
and
barked
alarmingly
she
unlocked
the
door
saw
that
no
one
was
passing
and
opening
the
little
gate
looked
out
charon
stood
watching
a
prostrate
form
and
she
fearlessly
crossed
the
street
and
bent
over
the
body
one
arm
was
crushed
beneath
him
the
other
thrown
up
over
the
face
she
recognized
the
watch
chain
which
was
of
a
curious
pattern
and
for
an
instant
all
objects
swam
before
her
she
felt
faint
her
heart
seemed
to
grow
icy
and
numb
but
with
a
great
effort
she
moved
the
arm
and
looked
on
the
face
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
trembling
like
a
weed
in
a
wintry
blast
she
knelt
beside
him
he
was
insensible
but
not
dead
though
it
was
evident
there
must
have
been
some
severe
contusion
about
the
head
she
saw
that
no
time
should
be
lost
and
running
into
one
of
the
neighboring
houses
knocked
violently
the
noise
of
the
horse
and
buggy
had
already
aroused
the
inmates
and
very
soon
the
motionless
form
was
borne
into
beulah
little
cottage
and
placed
on
a
couch
while
a
messenger
was
dispatched
for
asbury
eugene
remained
just
as
they
placed
him
and
kneeling
beside
him
beulah
held
his
cold
hands
in
hers
and
watched
in
almost
breathless
anxiety
for
some
return
of
animation
she
knew
that
he
was
intoxicated
that
this
and
this
only
caused
the
accident
and
tears
of
shame
and
commiseration
trickled
down
her
cheeks
since
their
parting
interview
previous
to
his
marriage
they
had
met
but
once
and
then
in
silence
beside
cornelia
in
her
dying
hour
it
was
little
more
than
a
year
since
she
had
risked
his
displeasure
and
remonstrated
with
him
on
his
ruinous
course
and
that
comparatively
short
period
had
wrought
painful
changes
in
his
once
noble
handsome
face
she
had
hoped
that
cornelia
dying
prayer
would
save
him
but
now
alas
it
was
too
apparent
that
the
appeal
had
been
futile
she
knew
not
that
his
wife
was
absent
and
determined
to
send
for
her
as
soon
as
possible
the
long
hour
of
waiting
seemed
an
eternity
but
at
last
asbury
came
and
carefully
examined
the
bruised
limbs
beulah
grasped
his
arm
oh
will
he
die
i
do
know
child
this
arm
is
badly
fractured
and
i
am
afraid
there
is
a
severe
injury
on
the
back
of
the
head
it
wo
do
to
move
him
home
so
send
hal
in
from
my
buggy
to
help
put
him
in
bed
have
me
some
bandages
at
once
beulah
as
they
carried
him
into
williams
room
and
prepared
to
set
the
fractured
arm
he
groaned
and
for
a
moment
struggled
then
relapsed
into
a
heavy
stupor
asbury
carefully
straightened
and
bandaged
the
limb
and
washed
the
blood
from
his
temples
where
a
gash
had
been
inflicted
in
the
fall
will
you
go
to
his
wife
at
once
sir
and
inform
her
of
his
condition
said
beulah
who
stood
by
the
pillow
pale
and
anxious
do
you
know
his
wife
is
not
here
she
has
gone
for
the
summer
wife
did
i
say
she
does
not
deserve
the
sacred
name
if
he
had
had
a
wife
he
would
never
have
come
to
this
ruin
and
disgrace
it
is
nothing
more
than
i
expected
when
he
married
her
i
could
easily
put
her
soul
on
the
end
of
a
lancet
and
as
for
heart
she
has
none
at
all
she
is
a
pretty
flirt
fonder
of
admiration
than
of
her
husband
i
will
write
by
the
earliest
mail
informing
graham
of
the
accident
and
its
possible
consequences
and
perhaps
respect
for
the
opinion
of
the
world
may
bring
her
home
to
him
beulah
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
believe
that
that
drunken
stupid
victim
there
is
eugene
graham
who
promised
to
become
an
honor
to
his
friends
and
his
name
satan
must
have
established
the
first
distillery
the
institution
smacks
of
the
infernal
child
keep
ice
upon
that
head
will
you
and
see
that
as
soon
as
possible
he
takes
a
spoonful
of
the
medicine
i
mixed
just
now
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
many
days
before
he
leaves
this
house
if
he
lives
the
only
consolation
is
that
it
may
be
a
lesson
and
warning
to
him
i
will
be
back
in
an
hour
or
so
as
for
proctor
whom
i
met
limping
home
it
would
have
been
a
blessing
to
the
other
young
men
of
the
city
and
to
society
generally
if
he
had
never
crawled
out
of
the
sand
where
he
was
thrown
a
little
while
after
the
silence
was
broken
by
a
heavy
sob
and
glancing
up
beulah
perceived
the
matron
standing
near
the
bed
gazing
at
the
sleeper
oh
that
he
should
come
to
this
i
would
ten
thousand
times
rather
he
had
died
in
his
unstained
boyhood
if
he
lives
this
accident
may
be
his
salvation
god
grant
it
may
god
grant
it
may
falling
on
her
knees
the
aged
woman
put
up
a
prayer
of
passionate
entreaty
that
almighty
god
would
spare
his
life
and
save
him
from
a
drunkard
fate
if
i
too
could
pray
for
him
it
might
ease
my
aching
heart
thought
beulah
as
she
listened
to
the
imploring
words
of
the
matron
and
why
not
ah
the
murky
vapors
of
unbelief
shrouded
the
father
from
her
wandering
soul
dawn
looked
in
upon
two
sorrowing
watchers
beside
that
stupid
slumberer
and
showed
that
the
physician
fears
were
realized
a
raging
fever
had
set
in
and
this
night
was
but
the
commencement
of
long
and
weary
vigils
about
noon
beulah
was
crossing
the
hall
with
a
bowl
of
ice
in
her
hand
when
someone
at
the
door
pronounced
her
name
and
proctor
approached
her
accompanied
by
cowdon
she
had
once
met
the
former
at
graham
and
having
heard
cornelia
regret
the
miserable
influence
he
exerted
over
her
brother
was
prepared
to
receive
him
coldly
we
have
come
to
see
graham
madam
said
he
shrinking
from
her
sad
searching
eyes
yet
assuming
an
air
of
haughty
indifference
you
can
not
see
him
sir
but
i
tell
you
i
must
i
shall
remove
him
to
his
own
house
where
he
can
be
properly
attended
to
where
is
he
the
physician
particularly
urged
the
necessity
of
keeping
everything
quiet
he
shall
not
be
disturbed
but
as
he
is
unconscious
perhaps
it
will
afford
you
some
gratification
to
behold
the
ruin
you
have
wrought
gentlemen
here
is
your
victim
she
opened
the
door
and
suffered
them
to
stand
on
the
threshold
and
look
at
the
prostrate
form
with
the
head
enveloped
in
icy
cloths
and
the
face
bloated
and
purplish
from
bruises
and
fever
neither
proctor
nor
his
companion
could
endure
the
smile
of
withering
contempt
which
curled
her
lips
as
she
pointed
to
the
victim
of
their
temptations
and
influence
and
with
a
imprecation
proctor
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
house
apparently
this
brief
visit
quite
satisfied
them
for
it
was
not
repeated
days
and
nights
of
unremitted
watching
ensued
eugene
was
wildly
delirious
now
singing
snatches
of
drinking
songs
and
waving
his
hand
as
if
to
his
guests
and
now
bitterly
upbraiding
his
wife
for
her
heartlessness
and
folly
the
confinement
of
his
fractured
arm
frenzied
him
often
he
struggled
violently
to
free
himself
fancying
that
he
was
incarcerated
in
some
horrid
dungeon
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
after
the
accident
a
carriage
stopped
at
the
cottage
gate
and
springing
out
graham
hurried
into
the
house
as
he
entered
the
sickroom
and
caught
sight
of
the
tossing
sufferer
a
groan
escaped
him
and
he
covered
his
eyes
an
instant
as
if
to
shut
out
the
vision
eugene
imagined
he
saw
one
of
the
heidelberg
professors
and
laughing
immoderately
began
a
rapid
conversation
in
german
graham
could
not
conceal
his
emotion
and
fearing
its
effect
on
the
excitable
patient
beulah
beckoned
him
aside
and
warned
him
of
the
possible
consequences
he
grasped
her
hand
and
asked
the
particulars
of
the
occurrence
which
had
been
mentioned
to
him
vaguely
she
told
him
the
account
given
by
eugene
servants
of
the
night
revel
and
then
the
denouement
in
front
of
her
door
in
conclusion
she
said
earnestly
where
is
his
wife
why
is
she
not
here
she
seemed
to
think
she
could
render
no
assistance
and
fearing
that
all
would
be
over
before
we
could
get
here
preferred
my
coming
at
once
and
writing
to
her
of
his
condition
ah
she
is
miserably
fitted
for
such
scenes
as
you
must
have
witnessed
and
the
haired
man
sighed
heavily
what
can
she
bear
to
commit
her
husband
to
other
hands
at
such
a
crisis
as
this
how
can
she
live
away
from
his
side
when
every
hour
may
be
his
last
oh
is
she
indeed
so
utterly
utterly
heartless
selfish
callous
poor
eugene
better
find
release
from
such
a
union
in
death
than
go
through
life
bound
to
a
wife
so
unblushingly
indifferent
her
face
was
one
flash
of
scorn
and
indignation
and
extending
her
hand
toward
the
restless
invalid
she
continued
in
a
lower
tone
she
has
deserted
her
sacred
post
but
a
truer
better
friend
one
who
has
always
loved
him
as
a
brother
will
supply
her
place
all
that
a
sister
care
can
do
assuredly
he
shall
have
you
are
very
kind
miss
beulah
my
family
are
under
lasting
obligations
to
you
for
your
generous
attentions
to
that
poor
boy
of
ours
and
i
no
you
understand
little
of
the
nature
of
our
friendship
we
were
orphan
children
warmly
attached
to
each
other
before
you
took
him
to
a
home
of
wealth
and
lavish
indulgence
were
he
my
own
brother
i
could
not
feel
more
deeply
interested
in
his
welfare
and
while
he
requires
care
and
nursing
i
consider
it
my
privilege
to
watch
over
and
guard
him
there
is
asbury
in
the
hall
he
can
tell
you
better
than
i
of
his
probable
recovery
ah
reader
is
friendship
but
a
name
a
charm
that
lulls
to
bleep
a
shade
that
follows
wealth
or
fame
and
leaves
the
wretch
to
weep
graham
remained
at
the
cottage
and
having
written
to
antoinette
of
the
imminent
danger
in
which
he
found
her
husband
urged
her
to
lose
no
time
in
joining
him
unluckily
he
was
ignorant
of
all
the
information
which
is
so
essential
in
the
occupation
of
nursing
he
was
anxious
to
do
everything
in
his
power
but
like
the
majority
of
persons
on
such
occasions
failed
wretchedly
in
his
attempts
almost
as
restless
and
nervous
as
the
sick
man
he
only
increased
the
difficulties
he
would
fain
have
remedied
and
beulah
finally
prevailed
upon
him
to
abandon
his
efforts
and
leave
the
room
where
his
constant
movements
annoyed
and
irritated
the
sufferer
eugene
recognized
no
one
but
his
eyes
followed
beulah
continually
and
when
his
delirium
was
at
its
height
only
her
voice
and
clasp
of
his
hand
could
in
any
degree
soothe
him
in
his
ravings
she
noticed
two
constantly
conflicting
emotions
a
stern
bitterness
of
feeling
toward
his
wife
and
an
almost
adoring
fondness
for
his
infant
child
of
the
latter
he
talked
incessantly
and
vowed
that
she
at
least
should
love
him
as
the
weary
days
crept
by
beulah
started
at
every
sound
fancying
that
the
wife
had
certainly
come
but
hour
after
hour
found
only
williams
and
the
orphan
guarding
the
deserted
husband
gradually
the
fever
abated
and
a
stupor
succeeded
graham
stole
about
the
house
like
a
haunting
spirit
miserable
and
useless
and
in
the
solemn
stillness
of
midnight
only
beulah
sat
by
the
pillow
where
a
head
now
rested
motionless
as
that
of
a
corpse
williams
was
asleep
on
a
couch
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
and
in
the
dim
spectral
light
of
the
shaded
lamp
the
watcher
and
her
charge
looked
unearthly
faint
from
constant
vigils
beulah
threw
her
arm
on
the
bed
and
leaned
her
head
upon
it
keeping
her
eyes
on
the
colorless
face
before
her
who
that
has
watched
over
friends
hovering
upon
the
borders
of
the
spiritland
needs
to
be
told
how
dreary
was
the
heart
of
the
solitary
nurse
and
to
those
who
have
not
thus
suffered
and
endured
no
description
would
adequately
portray
the
desolation
and
gloom
the
stars
were
waning
when
eugene
moved
threw
up
his
hand
over
the
pillow
and
after
a
moment
opened
his
eyes
beulah
leaned
forward
and
he
looked
at
her
fixedly
as
if
puzzled
then
said
feebly
beulah
is
it
you
a
cry
of
joy
rolled
to
her
lips
but
she
hushed
it
and
answered
tremblingly
yes
eugene
it
is
beulah
his
eyes
wandered
about
the
room
and
then
rested
again
on
her
countenance
with
a
confused
perplexed
expression
am
i
at
home
what
is
the
matter
yes
eugene
at
home
among
your
best
friends
do
talk
any
more
try
to
sleep
again
with
a
great
joy
in
her
heart
she
extinguished
the
light
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
after
a
few
moments
he
said
slowly
beulah
did
i
dream
i
saw
you
beulah
she
felt
his
hand
put
out
as
if
to
feel
for
her
no
i
am
sitting
by
you
but
will
not
talk
to
you
now
you
must
keep
quiet
there
was
a
short
silence
but
where
am
i
not
at
home
i
know
she
did
not
reply
and
he
repeated
the
question
more
earnestly
you
are
in
my
house
eugene
let
that
satisfy
you
his
fingers
closed
over
hers
tightly
and
soon
he
slept
the
sun
was
high
in
the
sky
when
he
again
unclosed
his
eyes
and
found
asbury
feeling
his
pulse
his
mind
was
still
bewildered
and
he
looked
around
him
wonderingly
how
do
you
feel
graham
said
the
doctor
feel
as
if
i
had
been
standing
on
my
head
what
is
the
matter
with
me
doctor
have
i
been
sick
well
yes
you
have
not
been
exactly
well
and
feel
stupid
after
a
long
nap
take
a
spoonful
of
this
nectar
i
have
prepared
for
you
no
wry
faces
man
it
will
clear
your
head
eugene
attempted
to
raise
himself
but
fell
back
exhausted
while
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
his
arm
firmly
incased
in
wood
and
bandages
what
have
you
been
doing
to
my
arm
why
i
ca
move
it
i
oh
do
trouble
yourself
graham
you
injured
it
and
i
bound
it
up
that
is
all
when
gentlemen
amuse
themselves
with
such
gymnastic
feats
as
you
performed
they
must
expect
a
little
temporary
inconvenience
from
crushed
bones
and
overstrained
muscles
beulah
mind
my
directions
about
silence
and
quiet
the
doctor
walked
out
to
escape
further
questioning
eugene
looked
at
his
useless
stiffened
arm
and
then
at
beulah
saying
anxiously
what
is
the
matter
with
me
you
were
thrown
out
of
a
buggy
and
fractured
your
arm
in
the
fall
she
thought
it
best
to
tell
the
truth
at
once
memory
flew
back
to
her
deserted
throne
and
dimly
the
events
of
that
evening
revel
passed
through
his
mind
a
flush
of
shame
rose
to
his
temples
and
turning
his
head
toward
the
wall
he
hid
his
face
in
the
pillow
then
beulah
heard
a
deep
shuddering
sigh
and
a
groan
of
remorseful
agony
after
a
long
silence
he
said
in
a
tone
of
humiliation
that
drew
tears
to
her
eyes
how
long
have
i
been
here
she
told
him
the
number
of
days
and
he
immediately
asked
have
i
been
in
any
danger
yes
very
great
danger
out
that
has
all
passed
now
and
if
you
will
only
be
composed
and
careful
you
will
soon
be
strong
again
i
heard
my
father
talking
to
you
who
else
is
here
he
looked
at
her
with
eager
interest
no
one
else
except
our
kind
matron
graham
came
as
soon
as
the
letter
reached
him
and
has
not
left
the
house
since
a
look
of
indescribable
sorrow
and
shame
swept
over
his
countenance
as
he
continued
bitterly
and
did
antoinette
know
all
at
once
stop
beulah
tell
me
the
miserable
truth
did
she
know
all
and
still
remain
away
she
knew
all
that
had
been
communicated
to
graham
when
he
came
and
he
has
written
to
her
every
day
he
is
now
writing
to
inform
her
that
you
are
better
she
shrank
from
giving
the
pain
she
was
conscious
her
words
inflicted
i
deserve
it
all
yes
ingratitude
indifference
and
desertion
if
i
had
died
she
would
have
heard
it
unmoved
oh
cornelia
cornelia
it
is
a
fearful
retribution
more
bitter
than
death
averting
his
face
his
whole
frame
trembled
with
emotion
eugene
you
must
compose
yourself
remember
you
jeopardize
your
life
by
this
sort
of
excitement
why
did
you
let
me
die
what
have
i
to
live
for
a
name
disgraced
and
a
wife
unloving
and
heartless
what
has
the
future
but
wretchedness
and
shame
not
unless
you
will
it
so
you
should
want
to
live
to
retrieve
your
character
to
take
an
honorable
position
which
hitherto
you
have
recklessly
forfeited
to
make
the
world
respect
you
your
wife
revere
you
and
your
child
feel
that
she
may
be
proud
of
her
father
ah
eugene
all
this
the
future
calls
you
to
do
he
looked
up
at
her
as
she
stood
beside
him
pale
thin
and
weary
and
his
feeble
voice
faltered
as
he
asked
beulah
my
best
friend
my
sister
do
you
quite
despise
me
she
laid
her
hands
softly
on
his
and
stooping
down
pressed
her
lips
to
his
forehead
eugene
once
i
feared
that
you
had
fallen
even
below
my
pity
but
now
i
believe
you
will
redeem
yourself
i
hope
that
thoroughly
reformed
you
will
command
the
respect
of
all
who
know
you
and
realize
the
proud
aspirations
i
once
indulged
for
you
that
you
can
do
this
i
feel
assured
that
you
will
i
do
most
sincerely
trust
i
have
not
yet
lost
faith
in
you
eugene
i
hope
still
she
left
him
to
ponder
in
solitude
the
humiliating
result
of
his
course
of
dissipation
chapter
xxxiv
the
hours
of
gradual
convalescence
were
very
trying
to
beulah
now
that
the
sense
of
danger
no
longer
nerved
her
to
almost
superhuman
endurance
and
exertion
graham
waited
until
his
adopted
son
was
able
to
sit
up
and
then
returned
to
the
where
his
wife
remained
thus
the
entire
charge
of
the
invalid
devolved
on
the
tireless
friends
who
had
watched
over
him
in
the
hour
of
peril
beulah
had
endeavored
to
banish
the
sorrow
that
pressed
so
heavily
on
her
heart
and
to
dispel
the
gloom
and
despondency
which
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
the
deserted
husband
she
read
talked
sang
to
him
and
constantly
strove
to
cheer
him
by
painting
a
future
in
which
the
past
was
to
be
effectually
canceled
though
exhausted
by
incessant
care
and
loss
of
sleep
she
never
complained
of
weariness
and
always
forced
a
smile
of
welcome
to
her
lips
when
the
invalid
had
his
chair
wheeled
to
her
side
or
tottered
out
into
the
dining
room
to
join
her
one
morning
in
august
she
sat
on
the
little
gallery
at
the
rear
of
the
house
with
a
table
before
her
engaged
in
drawing
some
of
the
clusters
of
blue
white
and
pink
convolvulus
which
festooned
the
pillars
and
balustrade
eugene
sat
near
her
with
his
thin
face
leaning
on
his
hand
his
thoughts
evidently
far
removed
from
flowers
his
arm
was
still
in
a
sling
and
he
looked
emaciated
and
dejected
williams
had
been
talking
to
him
cheerfully
about
some
money
matters
he
had
promised
to
arrange
for
her
so
soon
as
he
was
well
enough
to
go
to
his
office
but
gathering
up
her
working
materials
the
old
lady
went
into
the
kitchen
and
the
two
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
one
of
his
drawn
sighs
arrested
beulah
attention
and
she
said
kindly
what
is
the
matter
brother
mine
are
you
tired
of
watching
my
clumsy
fingers
shall
i
finish
that
essay
of
macaulay
you
were
so
much
interested
in
yesterday
or
will
you
have
another
of
poems
she
laid
down
her
pencil
quite
ready
to
divert
his
mind
by
reading
no
do
not
quit
your
drawing
i
should
not
enjoy
even
macaulay
day
he
threw
his
head
back
and
sighed
again
why
eugene
do
you
feel
as
well
as
usual
this
morning
remember
your
family
will
arrive
you
should
be
the
happiest
man
living
oh
beulah
do
mock
me
i
can
not
bear
it
my
life
seems
a
hopeless
blank
you
ought
not
to
talk
so
despondingly
you
have
everything
to
live
for
house
your
energies
be
indeed
a
man
conquer
this
weak
repining
spirit
do
you
remember
the
motto
on
the
tombstone
at
gilgen
not
mournfully
on
the
past
it
comes
not
back
enjoy
the
present
it
is
thine
go
forth
to
meet
the
shadowy
future
with
a
manly
heart
and
without
fear
you
know
little
of
what
oppresses
me
it
is
the
knowledge
of
my
of
antoinette
indifference
which
makes
the
future
so
joyless
so
desolate
beulah
this
has
caused
my
ruin
when
i
stood
by
cornelia
coffin
and
recalled
her
last
frantic
appeal
when
i
looked
down
at
her
cold
face
and
remembered
her
devoted
love
for
her
unworthy
brother
i
vowed
never
to
touch
wine
again
to
absent
myself
from
the
associates
who
had
led
me
to
dissipation
beulah
i
was
honest
and
intended
to
reform
from
that
hour
but
avowed
coldness
or
to
call
it
by
its
proper
name
heartless
selfishness
and
fondness
for
admiration
first
disgusted
and
then
maddened
me
i
would
have
gladly
spent
my
evenings
quietly
in
our
elegant
home
but
she
contrived
to
have
it
crowded
with
visitors
as
soulless
and
frivolous
as
herself
i
remonstrated
she
was
sneering
defiant
and
unyielding
and
assured
me
she
would
herself
as
she
thought
proper
i
followed
her
example
and
went
back
to
the
reckless
companions
who
continually
beset
my
path
i
was
miserably
deceived
in
antoinette
character
she
was
very
beautiful
and
i
was
blind
to
her
mental
nay
i
may
as
well
say
it
at
once
her
moral
defects
i
believed
she
was
warmly
attached
to
me
and
i
loved
her
most
devotedly
but
no
sooner
were
we
married
than
i
discovered
my
blind
rashness
cornelia
warned
me
but
what
man
fascinated
by
a
beautiful
girl
ever
listened
to
counsels
that
opposed
his
heart
antoinette
is
too
intensely
selfish
to
love
anything
or
anybody
but
herself
she
does
not
even
love
her
child
strange
as
it
may
seem
she
is
too
entirely
engrossed
by
her
weak
fondness
for
display
and
admiration
even
to
caress
her
babe
except
at
breakfast
and
dinner
we
rarely
meet
and
then
unless
company
is
present
which
is
generally
the
case
our
intercourse
is
studiedly
cold
do
you
wonder
that
i
am
hopeless
in
view
of
a
life
passed
with
such
a
companion
oh
that
i
could
blot
out
the
last
two
years
of
my
existence
he
groaned
and
shaded
his
face
with
his
hands
but
eugene
probably
your
reformation
and
altered
course
will
win
you
your
wife
love
and
reverence
suggested
beulah
anxious
to
offer
some
incentive
to
exertion
i
know
her
nature
too
well
to
hope
that
a
woman
who
prefers
to
dance
and
ride
with
gentlemen
rather
than
remain
in
her
luxurious
home
with
her
babe
and
her
duties
can
not
be
won
from
her
life
no
no
i
despair
of
happiness
from
her
society
and
affection
and
if
at
all
must
derive
it
from
other
sources
my
child
is
the
one
living
blossom
amidst
all
my
withered
hopes
she
is
the
only
treasure
i
have
except
your
friendship
she
shall
never
blush
for
her
father
degradation
henceforth
though
an
unhappy
man
i
shall
prove
myself
a
temperate
one
i
can
not
trust
my
child
education
to
antoinette
she
is
unworthy
the
sacred
charge
i
must
fit
myself
to
form
her
character
oh
beulah
if
i
could
make
her
such
a
woman
as
you
are
then
i
could
indeed
bear
my
lot
patiently
i
named
her
cornelia
but
henceforth
she
shall
be
called
beulah
also
in
token
of
her
father
gratitude
to
his
truest
friend
no
eugene
call
her
not
after
me
lest
some
of
my
sorrows
come
upon
her
young
head
oh
no
name
her
not
beulah
let
her
be
called
cornelia
i
would
not
have
her
soul
shrouded
as
mine
has
been
beulah
spoke
vehemently
and
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
she
added
eugene
you
will
leave
me
and
go
back
to
your
own
house
to
your
family
but
before
you
go
i
ask
you
if
not
for
your
sake
for
that
of
your
child
to
promise
me
solemnly
that
you
will
never
again
touch
intoxicating
drinks
of
any
kind
oh
will
you
promise
will
you
reform
entirely
there
was
a
brief
pause
and
he
answered
slowly
i
promise
beulah
nay
my
friend
i
swear
i
will
abstain
in
future
ah
i
will
never
disgrace
my
angel
child
never
so
help
me
heaven
the
sound
of
approaching
steps
interrupted
the
conversation
and
expecting
to
see
antoinette
and
her
infant
accompanied
by
and
graham
beulah
looked
up
quickly
and
perceived
lindsay
does
my
advent
startle
you
that
you
look
so
pale
and
breathless
said
he
smiling
as
he
took
her
hand
i
am
certainly
very
much
surprised
to
see
you
here
sir
and
i
am
heartily
glad
you
have
come
reginald
cried
eugene
returning
his
friend
tight
clasp
i
intended
coming
to
nurse
you
graham
as
soon
as
i
heard
of
the
accident
but
my
mother
illness
prevented
my
leaving
home
i
need
not
ask
about
your
arm
i
see
it
still
requires
cautious
handling
but
how
are
you
otherwise
regaining
your
strength
i
hope
yes
gradually
i
am
better
than
i
deserve
to
be
reginald
that
remains
to
be
proved
in
future
graham
come
get
well
as
rapidly
as
possible
i
have
a
plan
to
submit
to
you
the
earliest
day
you
are
strong
enough
to
discuss
business
topics
miss
beulah
let
me
sharpen
your
pencil
he
took
it
from
her
trimmed
it
carefully
and
handed
it
back
then
drew
her
portfolio
near
him
and
glanced
over
the
numerous
unfinished
sketches
i
have
several
books
filled
with
european
sketches
which
i
think
might
afford
you
some
pleasure
they
were
taken
by
different
persons
and
some
of
the
views
on
the
rhine
and
particularly
some
along
the
southern
shore
of
spain
are
unsurpassed
by
any
i
have
seen
you
may
receive
them
some
day
after
i
return
thank
you
i
shall
copy
them
with
great
pleasure
i
see
you
are
not
as
much
of
a
pyrrhonist
in
art
as
in
philosophy
said
lindsay
watching
her
countenance
as
she
bent
over
her
drawing
who
told
you
sir
that
i
was
one
in
any
department
she
looked
up
suddenly
with
flashing
eyes
there
is
no
need
to
be
told
i
can
readily
perceive
it
your
penetration
is
at
fault
then
of
all
others
the
charge
of
pyrrhonism
is
the
last
i
merit
he
smiled
and
said
quietly
what
then
is
your
aesthetic
creed
if
i
may
inquire
it
is
nearly
allied
to
cousin
i
thought
you
had
abjured
eclecticism
yet
cousin
is
its
apostle
once
admit
his
theory
of
the
beautiful
and
you
can
not
reject
his
psychology
and
ethics
nay
his
theodicea
i
do
not
desire
to
separate
his
system
as
such
i
receive
it
beulah
compressed
her
lips
firmly
and
looked
at
her
interrogator
half
defiantly
you
deliberately
shut
your
eyes
then
to
the
goal
his
philosophy
sets
before
you
no
i
am
nearing
the
goal
looking
steadily
toward
it
she
spoke
hastily
and
with
an
involuntary
wrinkling
of
her
brow
and
that
goal
is
pantheism
draped
gorgeously
but
pantheism
still
answered
lindsay
with
solemn
emphasis
no
his
whole
psychology
is
opposed
to
pantheism
cried
beulah
pushing
aside
her
drawing
materials
and
meeting
his
eyes
fixedly
you
probably
attach
undue
weight
to
his
assertion
that
although
god
passes
into
the
universe
or
therein
manifests
all
the
elements
of
his
being
he
is
not
in
the
act
now
granting
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
god
is
not
entirely
absorbed
in
the
universe
cousin
pet
doctrine
of
the
apperception
of
absolute
truths
clearly
renders
man
a
modification
of
god
difference
in
degree
you
know
implies
sameness
of
kind
from
this
there
is
no
escape
he
says
god
of
consciousness
is
not
a
solitary
sovereign
banished
beyond
creation
upon
the
throne
of
a
silent
eternity
and
an
absolute
existence
which
resembles
existence
in
no
respect
whatever
he
is
a
god
at
once
true
and
real
substance
and
cause
one
and
many
eternity
and
time
essence
and
life
end
and
middle
at
the
summit
of
existence
and
at
its
base
infinite
and
finite
together
in
a
word
a
trinity
being
at
the
same
time
god
nature
and
humanity
his
separation
of
reason
and
reasoning
and
the
results
of
his
boasted
apperception
are
very
nearly
allied
to
those
of
intuition
yet
i
suppose
you
would
shrink
from
the
identity
of
the
latter
you
have
not
stated
the
question
fairly
sir
he
reiterates
that
the
absolute
belongs
to
none
of
us
we
perceive
truth
but
do
not
create
it
retorted
beulah
you
will
perhaps
remember
his
saying
explicitly
that
we
can
comprehend
the
absolute
yes
i
recollect
and
moreover
he
declares
that
are
conducted
to
god
by
a
ray
of
his
own
being
can
limited
faculties
comprehend
the
infinite
and
eternal
creator
we
do
not
attain
a
knowledge
of
him
through
finite
channels
cousin
contends
that
it
is
by
means
of
relation
to
the
absolute
that
we
know
god
then
to
know
the
absolute
or
god
you
must
be
the
absolute
or
in
other
words
god
only
can
find
god
this
is
the
simple
doctrine
when
you
unwind
the
veil
he
has
cleverly
hung
over
it
true
he
denounces
pantheism
but
here
is
pantheism
of
the
eclectic
patent
differing
from
that
of
other
systems
only
in
subtlety
of
expression
wherein
cousin
certainly
excels
one
of
the
most
profound
philosophical
writers
of
the
age
footnote
moreil
speculative
philosophy
of
europe
and
one
whose
opinion
on
this
point
certainly
merits
careful
consideration
has
remarked
in
an
analysis
of
cousin
system
regard
to
his
notion
of
deity
we
have
already
shown
how
closely
this
verges
upon
the
principle
of
pantheism
even
if
we
admit
that
it
is
not
a
doctrine
like
that
of
spinoza
which
identifies
god
with
the
abstract
idea
of
substance
or
even
like
that
of
hegel
which
regards
deity
as
synonymous
with
the
absolute
law
and
process
of
the
universe
if
we
admit
in
fact
that
the
deity
of
cousin
possesses
a
conscious
personality
yet
still
it
is
one
which
contains
in
itself
the
infinite
personality
and
consciousness
of
every
subordinate
mind
god
is
the
ocean
we
are
but
the
waves
the
ocean
may
be
one
individuality
and
each
wave
another
but
still
they
are
essentially
one
and
the
same
we
see
not
how
cousin
theism
can
possibly
be
consistent
with
any
idea
of
moral
evil
neither
do
we
see
how
starting
from
such
a
dogma
he
can
ever
vindicate
and
uphold
his
own
theory
of
human
liberty
on
such
theistic
principles
all
sin
must
be
simply
defect
and
all
defect
must
be
absolutely
fatuitous
eclecticism
was
a
beautiful
but
frail
levee
opposed
to
the
swollen
tide
of
skepticism
and
as
in
every
other
crevasse
when
swept
away
it
only
caused
the
stream
to
rush
on
more
madly
he
watched
her
closely
as
he
spoke
and
observed
the
quiver
of
her
long
curling
lashes
he
saw
too
that
she
was
resolved
not
to
surrender
and
waited
for
an
explicit
defense
but
here
eugene
interrupted
all
this
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
reminds
me
of
heidelberg
days
when
a
few
of
us
roamed
about
the
odenwald
chopping
off
flowers
with
our
canes
and
discussing
philosophy
rare
jargon
we
made
of
it
talking
of
cosmothetie
idealism
or
hypothetical
dualism
of
noetic
and
dianoetic
principles
of
hylozoism
and
hypostasis
and
demonstrating
the
most
undemonstrable
propositions
by
appeals
to
the
law
of
contradiction
or
of
excluded
middle
i
fancied
then
that
i
was
growing
very
learned
wondered
whether
beulah
here
would
be
able
to
keep
up
with
me
and
really
thought
i
understood
what
i
discoursed
about
so
logically
you
can
at
least
console
yourself
graham
by
determining
that
know
what
what
and
that
as
high
as
metaphysic
wit
can
fly
i
imagine
there
are
very
few
of
us
who
would
agree
with
some
of
our
philosophers
that
pursuit
of
truth
is
far
more
important
than
the
attainment
thereof
that
philosophizing
is
more
valuable
than
philosophy
to
be
conversant
with
the
abstractions
which
in
the
hands
of
some
metaphysical
giants
have
rendered
both
mind
and
matter
like
abstractions
is
a
course
of
proceeding
i
should
scarcely
indorse
and
the
best
antidote
i
remember
just
now
to
any
such
proclivities
is
a
persual
of
the
three
first
lectures
of
sidney
smith
on
philosophy
in
recapitulating
the
tenets
of
the
schools
he
says
speculations
of
many
of
the
ancients
on
the
human
understanding
are
so
confused
and
so
purely
hypothetical
that
their
greatest
admirers
are
not
agreed
upon
their
meaning
and
whenever
we
can
procure
a
plain
statement
of
their
doctrines
all
other
modes
of
refuting
them
appear
to
be
wholly
superfluous
miss
beulah
i
especially
commend
you
to
these
humorous
lectures
he
bowed
to
her
with
easy
grace
i
have
them
sir
have
read
them
with
great
pleasure
said
beulah
smiling
at
his
droll
manner
of
mingled
reserve
and
freedom
what
an
exalted
estimate
that
same
incorrigible
sidney
must
have
placed
upon
the
public
taste
of
this
republican
land
of
ours
in
one
of
his
lectures
on
beauty
of
form
i
remember
he
says
chin
ending
in
a
very
sharp
angle
would
be
a
perfect
deformity
a
man
whose
chin
terminated
in
a
point
would
be
under
the
immediate
necessity
of
retiring
to
america
he
would
be
such
a
perfect
horror
decidedly
flattering
to
our
national
type
of
beauty
as
eugene
spoke
his
lips
wore
a
smile
more
akin
to
those
of
his
boyhood
than
any
beulah
had
seen
since
his
return
from
europe
yes
that
was
to
show
the
influence
of
custom
be
it
remembered
and
in
the
same
connection
he
remarks
honestly
enough
that
he
knows
what
a
grecian
face
is
but
thinks
it
very
probable
that
if
the
elegant
arts
had
been
transmitted
to
us
from
the
chinese
instead
of
the
greeks
that
singular
piece
of
deformity
a
chinese
nose
would
have
been
held
in
high
estimation
it
was
merely
association
which
i
do
believe
a
word
of
cried
beulah
appropriating
the
last
as
a
lunge
at
her
favorite
absolutism
rising
she
placed
her
drawings
in
the
portfolio
for
the
sun
had
crept
round
the
corner
of
the
gallery
and
was
shining
in
her
face
lindsay
smiled
without
replying
and
gave
his
arm
to
assist
eugene
into
the
house
they
were
comfortably
seated
in
the
dining
room
and
beulah
knew
that
the
discussion
was
about
to
be
renewed
when
a
carriage
dashed
up
to
the
door
eugene
turned
pale
and
a
sudden
rigidity
seized
his
features
beulah
gave
her
guest
a
quick
meaning
glance
and
retreated
to
the
gallery
whither
he
instantly
followed
her
leaving
eugene
to
receive
his
wife
without
witnesses
leaning
against
one
of
the
pillars
beulah
unfastened
a
wreath
of
blue
convolvulus
which
williams
had
twined
in
her
hair
an
hour
before
the
delicate
petals
were
withered
and
with
a
suppressed
sigh
she
threw
them
away
lindsay
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
her
saying
briefly
i
was
commissioned
to
give
you
this
and
knowing
the
contents
hope
a
favorable
answer
it
was
from
clara
urging
her
to
come
up
the
following
week
and
officiate
as
bridesmaid
at
her
wedding
she
could
return
home
with
helen
and
george
asbury
beulah
read
the
letter
smiled
sadly
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
will
you
go
no
sir
why
not
you
need
a
change
of
air
and
the
trip
would
benefit
you
you
do
not
probably
know
how
much
you
have
altered
in
appearance
since
i
saw
you
my
uncle
is
coming
out
to
persuade
you
to
go
i
succeed
without
his
aid
i
could
not
leave
home
now
eugene
illness
has
prevented
my
accomplishing
some
necessary
work
and
as
i
consign
him
to
other
hands
i
must
make
amends
for
my
long
indolence
thank
you
for
taking
charge
of
my
letter
but
i
can
not
think
of
going
he
perceived
that
no
amount
of
persuasion
would
avail
and
for
an
instant
a
look
of
annoyance
crossed
his
face
but
his
brow
cleared
as
he
said
with
a
smile
for
a
year
i
have
watched
for
your
articles
and
the
magazine
is
a
constant
companion
of
my
desk
sometimes
i
am
tempted
to
criticise
your
sketches
perhaps
i
may
do
so
yet
and
that
in
no
boswell
spirit
either
doubtless
sir
you
would
find
them
very
vulnerable
to
criticism
which
nowadays
has
become
a
synonym
for
at
least
this
carping
proclivity
characterizes
the
class
who
seem
desirous
only
of
earning
reputation
as
literary
jeffreys
i
am
aware
sir
that
i
am
very
vulnerable
suppose
then
that
at
the
next
month
literary
assize
as
you
seem
disposed
to
consider
it
you
find
in
some
of
the
magazines
a
severe
animadversion
upon
the
spirit
of
your
writings
dare
i
do
this
and
still
hope
for
your
friendship
he
watched
her
closely
certainly
sir
i
am
not
writing
merely
to
see
myself
in
print
nor
wholly
for
remuneration
in
dollars
and
cents
i
am
earnestly
searching
for
truth
and
if
in
my
articles
you
discover
error
and
can
correct
it
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
do
so
provided
you
adopt
the
catholic
spirit
which
should
distinguish
such
undertakings
now
if
you
merely
intend
to
hold
me
up
for
ridicule
as
thoroughly
as
possible
i
prefer
that
you
let
me
and
my
articles
rest
but
a
calm
dispassionate
criticism
i
should
not
shrink
from
i
write
only
what
i
believe
and
if
i
am
in
error
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
it
corrected
miss
benton
may
i
venture
to
correct
it
without
having
recourse
to
the
vehicle
of
public
criticism
will
you
permit
me
to
discuss
with
you
here
in
your
quiet
home
those
vital
questions
whose
solution
seems
to
engage
your
every
thought
she
drew
back
and
answered
with
a
dreary
sort
of
smile
i
am
afraid
you
would
derive
little
pleasure
and
i
less
profit
from
such
disputation
i
have
learned
from
bitter
experience
that
merely
logical
forms
of
argumentation
do
not
satisfy
the
hungry
soul
the
rigid
processes
of
idealism
annihilated
the
external
world
and
hume
proved
that
mind
was
a
like
chimera
yet
who
was
ever
seriously
converted
by
their
incontrovertible
reasoning
i
have
lost
faith
in
ratiocination
still
you
cling
to
opinions
founded
on
its
errors
why
not
be
consistent
and
in
rejecting
its
most
potent
ally
reject
the
conclusions
of
rationalism
also
because
i
must
believe
something
faith
in
some
creed
is
an
absolute
necessity
of
human
nature
you
distinguish
faith
then
from
intellectual
belief
no
i
compound
them
my
faith
is
based
on
mental
conviction
replied
beulah
perceiving
whither
he
was
leading
her
and
resolved
not
to
follow
and
this
conviction
results
from
those
same
processes
of
ratiocination
which
you
condemn
as
unworthy
of
credence
because
subject
to
gross
sometimes
ludicrous
perversions
i
am
unable
to
detect
any
such
perversion
or
inaccuracy
in
the
cautious
course
of
reasoning
which
has
assisted
me
to
my
present
belief
pardon
me
but
does
this
fact
convince
you
of
the
infallibility
of
the
course
have
you
constituted
your
individual
reason
the
sole
judge
yes
there
is
no
other
left
me
and
your
conclusions
are
true
for
you
only
since
the
individual
organism
of
your
mind
makes
them
so
to
an
intellect
of
a
higher
or
lower
grade
these
conclusions
would
be
untenable
since
the
depressed
or
exalted
reason
judged
them
accordingly
you
may
cling
to
some
doctrine
as
absolutely
and
necessarily
true
yet
to
my
mind
it
may
seem
a
shallow
delusion
like
the
vagaries
of
rappers
no
reasoning
is
often
fallacious
but
reason
is
divine
reasoning
often
clouds
the
truth
but
reason
by
spontaneous
apperception
grasps
truth
persisted
beulah
unhesitatingly
then
truth
has
as
many
phases
and
as
antagonistic
as
there
are
individuals
in
the
universe
all
men
are
prophets
all
are
alike
inspired
all
alike
worthy
of
trust
and
credence
spontaneous
reason
has
grasped
a
number
of
oddly
conflicting
doctrines
let
me
tell
you
and
the
reconciliation
of
these
would
be
an
undertaking
to
which
the
dozen
labors
of
hercules
seem
a
farce
the
superstitions
of
various
ages
and
nations
are
not
valid
arguments
against
the
existence
of
universal
and
necessary
principles
why
then
have
these
principles
produced
no
unanimity
of
faith
the
history
of
the
human
race
is
the
history
of
the
rise
of
one
philosophy
and
religion
from
the
ashes
of
its
predecessor
there
is
one
universal
belief
in
the
necessity
of
religion
and
this
belief
built
altars
in
the
dawn
of
time
but
your
spontaneous
reason
is
perpetually
changing
the
idols
on
these
altars
the
god
of
one
reason
will
not
satisfy
that
of
his
neighbor
before
beulah
could
reply
she
heard
eugene
calling
her
in
the
hall
and
was
hastening
to
meet
him
but
lindsay
caught
her
hand
and
said
you
have
not
yet
given
me
permission
to
intrude
on
your
seclusion
she
withdrew
her
hand
instantly
when
you
have
nothing
else
to
occupy
you
and
wish
to
while
away
an
hour
in
literary
discussion
you
will
generally
find
me
at
home
during
vacation
she
walked
on
and
joined
eugene
in
the
hall
antoinette
stood
in
the
door
and
they
merely
exchanged
bows
while
graham
grasped
her
hand
and
earnestly
thanked
her
for
the
many
kindnesses
she
had
rendered
to
his
family
beulah
looked
at
the
composed
beautiful
face
of
the
young
wife
and
then
at
the
thin
form
of
the
husband
and
said
hastily
you
owe
me
no
thanks
sir
the
claims
of
true
friendship
are
imperative
in
removing
to
his
own
house
i
trust
improvement
may
not
be
retarded
antoinette
tripped
down
the
steps
and
gathering
the
flounces
of
her
costly
dress
seated
herself
in
the
carriage
graham
bit
his
lip
colored
and
after
a
cordial
joined
her
eugene
smiled
bitterly
and
turning
to
beulah
took
both
her
hands
in
his
saying
feelingly
beulah
i
leave
your
house
a
wiser
if
not
less
miserable
man
i
am
going
to
atone
for
the
past
to
prove
to
you
that
your
faith
in
me
is
not
altogether
unmerited
if
i
am
saved
from
ruin
and
disgrace
i
owe
it
to
you
and
to
you
i
shall
look
for
sympathy
and
encouragement
to
you
my
best
friend
i
shall
often
come
for
sisterly
aid
when
clouds
gather
black
and
stormy
over
my
miserable
home
god
bless
you
beulah
i
have
promised
reformation
and
will
keep
my
promise
sacred
if
it
cost
me
my
life
he
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
linking
his
arm
in
lindsay
left
the
house
and
entered
the
carriage
while
the
latter
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
slowly
away
you
look
weary
child
you
must
give
yourself
some
rest
now
said
williams
wiping
her
eyes
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
rest
ah
yes
if
i
could
find
it
returned
the
girl
taking
the
comb
from
the
back
of
her
head
and
shaking
down
the
folds
of
hair
till
it
hung
round
her
like
a
long
mourning
veil
suppose
you
try
to
sleep
some
suggested
the
matron
i
have
some
work
to
do
first
said
she
drawing
a
long
breath
and
wiping
the
dust
from
her
desk
williams
withdrew
and
clasping
her
hands
over
her
forehead
beulah
stood
looking
up
with
dim
eyes
at
the
cloudless
face
that
smiled
down
on
her
until
she
almost
fancied
the
lips
parted
to
address
her
chapter
xxxv
lindsay
visits
grew
more
frequent
at
first
beulah
wondered
what
brought
him
so
often
from
his
distant
home
to
the
city
and
supposed
it
must
be
some
legal
business
which
engaged
him
but
gradually
a
different
solution
dawned
upon
her
mind
she
rejected
it
as
the
prompting
of
vanity
but
again
and
again
the
supposition
recurred
the
imperturbable
gravity
and
repose
of
his
manner
often
disconcerted
her
it
was
in
vain
that
she
resorted
to
sarcasm
and
irony
he
was
incorrigibly
unruffled
in
vain
she
was
cold
repellent
haughty
his
quiet
smile
remained
unaltered
his
superior
and
thoroughly
cultivated
intellect
and
the
unaffected
simplicity
of
his
manner
characterized
by
singular
candor
rendered
him
an
unusually
agreeable
companion
but
beulah
rebelled
against
the
unobtrusive
yet
constant
care
with
which
she
fancied
he
watched
her
the
seclusion
of
her
life
and
the
reserve
of
her
nature
conspired
to
impart
a
degree
of
abruptness
to
her
own
manners
and
to
one
who
understood
her
character
less
than
reginald
lindsay
there
was
an
unhesitating
sincerity
of
expression
which
might
have
been
termed
rudeness
the
frequency
of
his
visits
attracted
the
attention
of
strangers
already
the
busy
tongue
of
meddling
gossip
had
connected
their
names
asbury
too
bantered
her
unmercifully
upon
his
nephew
constant
pilgrimages
to
the
city
and
the
result
was
that
lindsay
receptions
grew
colder
and
less
flattering
continually
from
the
first
she
had
not
encouraged
his
visits
and
now
she
positively
discouraged
them
by
every
intimation
which
the
rules
of
etiquette
justified
her
in
offering
yet
she
respected
esteemed
and
in
many
things
admired
him
and
readily
confessed
to
her
own
heart
that
his
society
often
gave
her
pleasure
one
winter
evening
she
sat
alone
by
the
fire
with
a
newspaper
in
her
hand
reading
a
notice
of
the
last
number
of
the
magazine
in
which
one
of
her
sketches
was
roughly
handled
of
course
she
was
no
better
pleased
with
the
unflattering
criticism
than
the
majority
of
writers
in
such
cases
she
frowned
bit
her
lip
and
wondered
who
could
have
written
it
the
review
was
communicated
and
the
paper
had
been
sent
to
her
by
some
unknown
hand
once
more
she
read
the
article
and
her
brow
cleared
while
a
smile
broke
over
her
face
she
had
recognized
a
particular
dictum
and
was
no
longer
puzzled
leaning
her
head
on
her
palm
she
sat
looking
into
the
fire
ruminating
on
the
objections
urged
against
her
piece
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
been
unfavorably
criticised
and
this
was
sufficient
food
for
thought
lindsay
came
in
and
stood
near
her
unobserved
they
had
not
met
for
several
weeks
and
she
was
not
aware
that
he
was
in
the
city
charon
who
lay
on
the
rug
at
her
feet
growled
and
she
looked
round
said
her
visitor
extending
his
hand
she
did
not
accept
it
but
merely
inclined
her
head
saying
ah
how
do
you
do
sir
he
laid
a
package
on
the
table
drew
a
chair
near
the
hearth
without
looking
at
her
and
calling
to
charon
patted
his
huge
head
kindly
what
have
you
there
miss
beulah
merely
a
newspaper
it
seems
to
interest
you
intensely
may
i
see
it
i
am
certainly
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
for
the
chivalrous
spirit
in
which
you
indited
your
criticism
i
was
just
pondering
it
when
you
entered
she
smiled
as
she
spoke
and
shook
the
paper
at
him
i
thought
i
had
feigned
a
style
you
would
not
recognize
he
answered
quite
unconcernedly
you
succeeded
admirably
with
the
exception
of
one
pet
phrase
which
betrayed
you
next
time
recollect
that
you
are
very
partial
to
some
particular
expressions
with
which
i
happen
to
be
acquainted
and
avoid
their
introduction
i
rather
think
i
shall
not
repeat
the
experiment
especially
as
my
arguments
seem
to
have
failed
signally
in
their
design
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
understand
my
review
perfectly
he
looked
a
little
curious
she
fancied
disappointed
and
she
replied
laughingly
oh
i
think
i
do
it
is
not
so
very
abstruse
he
leaned
forward
took
the
paper
from
her
before
she
was
aware
of
his
intention
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
she
looked
surprised
and
he
offered
his
hand
once
more
are
we
still
friends
will
you
shake
hands
with
your
reviewer
she
unhesitatingly
put
her
hand
in
his
and
answered
friendship
is
not
a
gossamer
thread
to
be
severed
by
a
stroke
of
the
pen
she
endeavored
to
withdraw
her
fingers
but
he
held
them
firmly
while
his
blue
eyes
rested
upon
her
with
an
expression
she
by
no
means
liked
her
black
brows
met
in
a
heavy
frown
and
her
lips
parted
angrily
he
saw
it
and
instantly
released
her
hand
miss
beulah
my
uncle
commissioned
me
to
say
to
you
that
he
received
a
letter
from
hartwell
it
was
written
during
his
voyage
down
the
red
sea
and
contained
a
long
farewell
as
inland
travel
would
afford
no
facilities
for
writing
he
noted
the
tight
clasp
in
which
her
fingers
locked
each
other
and
the
livid
paleness
of
her
lips
and
brow
as
the
long
lashes
drooped
and
she
sat
silently
listening
charon
laid
his
head
on
her
knee
and
looked
up
at
her
there
was
a
brief
silence
and
lindsay
added
slowly
my
uncle
fears
he
will
never
return
do
you
cherish
the
hope
yes
he
will
come
back
if
his
life
is
spared
it
may
be
many
years
but
he
will
come
he
will
come
their
eyes
met
there
was
a
long
searching
look
from
lindsay
she
did
not
shrink
from
the
scrutiny
an
expression
of
keen
sorrow
swept
over
his
face
but
he
conquered
his
emotion
took
the
parcel
he
had
brought
and
unwrapping
a
book
said
in
his
usual
quiet
tone
when
i
saw
you
last
you
were
regretting
your
inability
to
procure
sir
william
hamilton
of
the
conditioned
and
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
bringing
you
my
own
copy
read
it
at
your
leisure
i
shall
not
need
it
again
soon
i
do
not
offer
it
as
a
system
which
will
satisfy
your
mind
by
solving
all
your
problems
but
i
do
most
earnestly
commend
his
of
the
conditioned
as
the
surest
antidote
to
the
abstractions
in
which
your
speculation
has
involved
you
the
most
erudite
scholar
of
the
age
and
one
of
the
finest
metaphysical
minds
the
world
has
ever
known
he
expressly
sums
up
his
vast
philosophic
researches
with
the
humble
confession
are
two
sorts
of
ignorances
we
philosophize
to
escape
ignorance
and
the
consummation
of
our
philosophy
is
ignorance
we
start
from
the
one
we
repose
in
the
other
they
are
the
goals
from
which
and
to
which
we
tend
and
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
is
but
a
course
between
two
ignorances
as
human
life
is
itself
only
a
traveling
from
grave
to
grave
the
highest
reach
of
human
science
is
the
scientific
recognition
of
human
ignorance
like
you
miss
beulah
i
set
out
to
discover
some
system
where
no
mysteries
existed
where
i
should
only
believe
what
i
could
clearly
comprehend
said
i
proudly
will
believe
nothing
that
i
can
not
understand
i
wandered
on
until
like
you
i
stood
in
a
wide
waste
strewn
with
the
wreck
of
beliefs
my
pride
asserted
that
my
reason
was
the
only
and
sufficient
guide
and
whither
did
it
lead
me
into
vagaries
more
inexplicable
than
aught
i
fled
from
in
revelation
it
was
easier
to
believe
that
the
beginning
god
created
the
heaven
and
the
earth
than
that
the
glorious
universe
looked
to
chance
as
its
sole
architect
or
that
it
was
a
huge
lumbering
machine
of
matter
grinding
out
laws
i
saw
that
i
was
the
victim
of
a
miserable
delusion
in
supposing
my
finite
faculties
could
successfully
grapple
with
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
i
found
that
to
receive
the
attempted
solutions
of
philosophy
required
more
faith
than
revelation
and
my
proud
soul
humbled
itself
and
rested
in
the
bible
my
philosophic
experience
had
taught
me
that
if
mankind
were
to
have
any
knowledge
of
their
origin
their
destiny
their
god
it
must
be
revealed
by
that
god
for
man
could
never
discover
aught
for
himself
there
are
mysteries
in
the
bible
which
i
can
not
explain
but
it
bears
incontrovertible
marks
of
divine
origin
and
as
such
i
receive
it
i
can
sooner
believe
the
mosaic
revelation
than
the
doctrine
which
tells
you
that
you
are
part
of
god
and
capable
of
penetrating
to
absolute
truth
to
quote
the
expressive
language
of
an
acute
critic
whose
latitudinarianism
and
disbelief
in
the
verbal
inspiration
of
scripture
give
peculiar
weight
to
his
opinion
on
this
subject
the
advocates
of
this
natural
spontaneous
inspiration
will
come
forth
from
their
recesses
of
thought
and
deliver
prophecies
as
clear
as
those
of
the
hebrew
seer
when
they
shall
mold
the
elements
of
nature
to
their
will
when
they
shall
speak
with
the
sublime
authority
of
jesus
of
nazareth
and
with
the
same
infinite
ease
rising
beyond
all
the
influence
of
time
place
and
circumstances
explain
the
past
and
unfold
the
future
when
they
die
for
the
truth
they
utter
and
rise
again
as
witnesses
to
its
divinity
then
we
may
begin
to
place
them
on
the
elevation
which
they
so
thoughtlessly
claim
but
until
they
either
prove
these
facts
to
be
delusions
or
give
their
parallel
in
themselves
the
world
may
well
laugh
at
their
ambition
and
trample
their
spurious
inspiration
beneath
its
feet
there
is
an
infinite
eternal
and
loving
god
i
am
a
finite
creature
unable
to
comprehend
him
and
knowing
him
only
through
his
own
revelation
this
very
revelation
is
insufficient
for
our
aspiring
souls
i
grant
but
it
declares
emphatically
that
here
see
through
a
glass
darkly
better
this
than
the
starless
night
in
which
you
grope
without
a
promise
of
the
dawn
of
eternity
where
all
mystery
shall
be
explained
are
you
not
weary
of
fruitless
mocking
speculation
he
looked
at
her
anxiously
she
raised
her
colorless
face
and
said
drearily
as
she
passed
her
hand
over
her
forehead
weary
ah
yes
weary
as
the
lonely
mariner
on
some
pathless
ocean
without
chart
or
compass
in
my
sky
even
the
star
of
hope
is
shrouded
weary
yes
in
body
and
mind
then
humble
your
proud
intellect
confess
your
ignorance
and
inability
and
rest
in
god
and
christianity
she
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
turning
away
he
walked
up
and
down
the
floor
for
some
moments
neither
spoke
finally
he
approached
her
and
continued
there
is
strange
significance
in
the
mosaic
record
of
the
fall
longing
for
the
fruits
of
knowledge
whereby
the
mysteries
of
god
would
be
revealed
cost
man
eden
the
first
pair
ate
knowledge
mocked
them
and
only
the
curse
remained
that
primeval
curse
of
desiring
to
know
all
things
descended
to
all
posterity
and
at
this
instant
you
exemplify
its
existence
ah
you
must
humble
your
intellect
if
you
would
have
it
exalted
must
be
willing
to
be
guided
along
unknown
paths
by
other
light
than
that
of
reason
if
you
would
be
happy
well
might
sir
william
hamilton
exclaim
is
this
powerful
tendency
of
the
most
vigorous
minds
to
transcend
the
sphere
of
our
faculties
which
makes
a
learned
ignorance
the
most
difficult
acquirement
perhaps
indeed
the
consummation
of
knowledge
he
sighed
as
he
uttered
these
words
she
said
nothing
and
putting
his
hand
gently
upon
hers
as
they
lay
folded
on
the
table
beside
her
he
added
sadly
i
had
hoped
that
i
could
aid
you
but
i
see
my
efforts
are
useless
you
will
not
be
guided
nor
influenced
by
others
are
determined
to
wander
on
in
night
solitary
and
restless
god
help
you
beulah
a
shudder
ran
over
her
but
she
made
no
reply
he
took
her
cold
hands
in
his
and
now
we
part
since
the
evening
i
first
saw
you
with
your
basket
of
strawberries
i
have
cherished
the
hope
that
i
might
one
day
be
more
than
a
friend
you
have
constantly
shown
me
that
i
was
nothing
more
to
you
i
have
seen
it
all
along
but
still
i
hoped
and
notwithstanding
your
coldness
i
shall
continue
to
hope
my
love
is
too
entirely
yours
to
be
readily
effaced
i
can
wait
patiently
beulah
you
do
not
love
me
now
perhaps
never
can
but
i
shall
at
least
cling
to
the
hope
i
shall
not
come
again
shall
not
weary
you
with
professions
and
attentions
i
know
your
nature
and
even
had
i
the
power
would
not
persuade
you
to
give
me
your
hand
now
but
time
may
change
your
feelings
on
this
frail
tenure
i
rest
my
hopes
meantime
should
circumstances
occur
which
demand
the
aid
or
counsel
of
devoted
friendship
may
i
ask
you
to
feel
no
hesitancy
in
claiming
any
assistance
i
can
render
and
beulah
at
any
instant
a
line
a
word
can
recall
me
the
separation
will
be
very
painful
to
me
but
i
can
not
longer
obtrude
myself
on
your
presence
if
as
i
earnestly
hope
the
hour
however
distant
should
come
when
you
desire
to
see
me
oh
beulah
how
gladly
will
i
hasten
to
you
we
can
never
be
more
than
friends
never
cried
beulah
you
think
so
now
and
perhaps
i
am
doomed
to
disappointment
but
without
your
sanction
i
shall
hope
it
he
pressed
his
lips
to
her
hand
and
walked
away
beulah
heard
the
closing
of
the
little
gate
and
then
for
the
first
time
his
meaning
flashed
upon
her
mind
he
believed
she
loved
her
guardian
fancied
that
long
absence
would
obliterate
his
image
from
her
heart
and
that
finally
grown
indifferent
to
one
who
might
never
return
she
would
give
her
love
to
him
whose
constancy
merited
it
genuine
delicacy
of
feeling
prevented
his
expressing
all
this
but
she
was
conscious
now
that
only
this
induced
his
unexpected
course
toward
herself
a
burning
flush
suffused
her
face
as
she
exclaimed
oh
how
unworthy
i
am
of
such
love
as
his
how
utterly
undeserving
soon
after
opening
the
book
he
had
brought
at
the
place
designated
she
drew
the
lamp
near
her
and
began
its
perusal
hour
after
hour
glided
away
and
not
until
the
last
page
was
concluded
did
she
lay
it
aside
the
work
contained
very
little
that
was
new
the
same
trains
of
thought
had
passed
through
her
mind
more
than
once
before
but
here
they
were
far
more
clearly
and
forcibly
expressed
she
drew
her
chair
to
the
window
threw
up
the
sash
and
looked
out
it
was
wintry
midnight
and
the
sky
blazed
with
its
undying
fires
this
starry
page
was
the
first
her
childish
intellect
had
puzzled
over
she
had
from
early
years
gazed
up
into
the
glittering
temple
of
night
and
asked
whence
came
yon
silent
worlds
floating
in
solemn
grandeur
along
the
blue
waveless
ocean
of
space
since
the
universe
sprang
from
that
dim
chaos
which
may
have
been
but
the
of
dead
worlds
those
unfading
lights
have
burned
on
bright
as
when
they
sang
together
at
the
creation
and
i
have
stretched
out
my
arms
helplessly
to
them
and
prayed
to
hear
just
once
their
unceasing
chant
of
praise
to
the
lord
of
glory
will
they
shine
on
forever
or
are
they
indeed
god
set
to
illumine
the
depths
of
space
and
blaze
a
path
along
which
the
soul
may
travel
to
its
god
will
they
one
day
flicker
and
go
out
to
every
thoughtful
mind
these
questions
propound
themselves
and
beulah
especially
had
essayed
to
answer
them
science
had
named
the
starry
hosts
and
computed
their
movements
with
wonderful
skill
but
what
could
it
teach
her
of
their
origin
and
destiny
absolutely
nothing
and
how
stood
her
investigations
in
the
more
occult
departments
of
psychology
and
ontology
an
honest
seeker
of
truth
what
had
these
years
of
inquiry
and
speculation
accomplished
let
her
answer
as
with
face
bowed
on
her
palms
her
eyes
roved
over
the
midnight
sky
once
i
had
some
principles
some
truths
clearly
defined
but
now
i
know
nothing
distinctly
believe
nothing
the
more
i
read
and
study
the
more
obscure
seem
the
questions
i
am
toiling
to
answer
is
this
increasing
intricacy
the
reward
of
an
earnestly
inquiring
mind
is
this
to
be
the
end
of
all
my
glorious
aspirations
have
i
come
to
this
far
and
no
farther
i
have
stumbled
on
these
boundaries
many
times
and
now
must
i
rest
here
oh
is
this
my
recompense
can
this
be
all
all
smothered
sobs
convulsed
her
frame
she
had
long
before
rejected
a
revealed
code
as
unnecessary
the
next
step
was
to
decipher
nature
symbols
and
thus
grasp
hidden
laws
but
here
the
old
trouble
arose
how
far
was
individualism
allowable
and
safe
to
reconcile
the
theories
of
rationalism
she
felt
was
indeed
a
herculean
task
and
she
groped
on
into
deeper
night
now
and
then
her
horizon
was
bestarred
and
in
her
delight
she
shouted
eureka
but
when
the
telescope
of
her
infallible
reason
was
brought
to
bear
upon
the
coldly
glittering
points
they
flickered
and
went
out
more
than
once
a
flaming
comet
of
german
manufacture
trailed
in
glory
athwart
her
dazzled
vision
but
close
observation
resolved
the
gilded
nebula
and
the
nucleus
mocked
her
doubt
engendered
doubt
the
death
of
one
difficulty
was
the
instant
birth
of
another
wave
after
wave
of
skepticism
surged
over
her
soul
until
the
image
of
a
great
personal
god
was
swept
from
its
altar
but
atheism
never
yet
usurped
the
sovereignty
of
the
human
mind
in
all
ages
moldering
vestiges
of
protean
deism
confront
the
giant
specter
and
every
nation
under
heaven
has
reared
its
fane
to
the
unknown
god
beulah
had
striven
to
enthrone
in
her
desecrated
soul
the
huge
dim
shapeless
phantom
of
pantheism
and
had
turned
eagerly
to
the
system
of
spinoza
the
heroic
grandeur
of
the
man
life
and
character
had
strangely
fascinated
her
but
now
that
idol
of
a
substance
whose
two
infinite
attributes
were
extension
and
thought
mocked
her
and
she
hurled
it
from
its
pedestal
and
looked
back
wistfully
to
the
pure
faith
of
her
childhood
a
godless
world
a
godless
woman
she
took
up
the
lamp
and
retired
to
her
own
room
on
all
sides
books
greeted
her
here
was
the
varied
lore
of
dead
centuries
here
she
had
held
communion
with
the
great
souls
entombed
in
these
dusty
pages
here
wrestling
alone
with
those
grim
puzzles
she
had
read
out
the
vexed
and
vexing
questions
in
this
debating
club
of
the
moldering
dead
and
endeavored
to
make
them
solve
them
these
volumes
with
close
marginalias
echoed
her
inquiries
but
answered
them
not
to
her
satisfaction
was
her
life
to
be
thus
passed
in
feverish
toil
and
ended
as
by
a
leap
out
into
a
black
shoreless
abyss
like
a
spent
child
she
threw
her
arms
on
the
mantelpiece
and
wept
uncontrollably
murmuring
oh
better
die
now
than
live
as
i
have
lived
in
perpetual
stragglings
what
is
life
worth
without
peace
of
mind
without
hope
and
what
hope
have
i
diamonded
webs
of
sophistry
can
no
longer
entangle
like
noah
dove
my
soul
has
fluttered
among
them
striving
in
vain
for
a
sure
hold
to
perch
upon
but
unlike
it
i
have
no
ark
to
flee
to
weary
and
almost
hopeless
i
would
fain
believe
that
this
world
is
indeed
as
a
deluge
and
in
it
there
is
no
ark
of
refuge
but
the
bible
it
is
true
i
did
not
see
this
ark
constructed
i
know
nothing
of
the
machinery
employed
and
no
more
than
noah
dove
can
i
explore
and
fully
understand
its
secret
chambers
yet
all
untutored
the
exhausted
bird
sought
safety
in
the
incomprehensible
and
was
saved
as
to
the
mysteries
of
revelation
and
inspiration
why
i
meet
mysteries

which
way
i
will
man
earth
time
eternity
god
are
all
inscrutable
mysteries
my
own
soul
is
a
mystery
unto
itself
and
so
long
as
i
am
impotent
to
fathom
its
depths
how
shall
i
hope
to
unfold
the
secrets
of
the
universe
she
had
rejected
christian
theism
because
she
could
not
understand
how
god
had
created
the
universe
out
of
nothing
true
with
god
all
things
are
possible
but
she
could
not
understand
this
creation
out
of
nothing
and
therefore
would
not
believe
it
yet
oh
inconsistency
of
human
reasoning
she
had
believed
that
the
universe
created
laws
that
matter
gradually
created

this
was
the
inevitable
result
of
pantheism
for
according
to
geology
there
was
a
primeval
period
when
neither
vegetable
nor
animal
life
existed
when
the
earth
was
a
huge
mass
of
inorganic
matter
of
two
incomprehensibilities
which
was
the
most
plausible
this
question
recurred
to
her
mind
with
irresistible
force
and
as
her
eyes
wandered
over
the
volumes
she
had
so
long
consulted
she
exclaimed
oh
philosophy
thou
hast
mocked
my
hungry
soul
thy
gilded
fruits
have
crumbled
to
ashes
in
my
grasp
in
lieu
of
the
holy
faith
of
my
girlhood
thou
hast
given
me
but
dim
doubtful
conjecture
cold
metaphysical
abstractions
intangible
shadows
that
flit
along
my
path
and
lure
me
on
to
deeper
morasses
oh
what
is
the
shadow
of
death
in
comparison
with
the
starless
night
which
has
fallen

me

in

her
proud

humbled
and
falling
on
her
knees
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
a
sobbing
prayer
went
up
to
the
throne
of
the
living
god

four
years
had
passed
since
eugene
graham
returned
to
his
home
after
his
severe
illness
and
now
as
he
sits
alone
in
his
library
with
a
bundle
of
legal
documents
before
him
it
is
not
difficult
to
perceive
that
his
promise
has
been
held
sacred
through
the
suggestion
of
lindsay
and
the
persuasions
of
beulah
he
had
closely
applied
himself
to
the
study
of
law
immediately
after
his
recovery
hopeless
of
happiness
in
his
home
ambition
became
the
ruling
passion
and
scourged
him
on
to
unceasing
exertion
the
aspirations
of
his
boyhood
revived
the
memory
of
his
humiliating
course
goaded
him
to
cover
the
past
with
the
garlands
of
fame
and
consciousness
of
unusual
talents
assured
him
of
final
success
graham
no
longer
opposed
the
design
as
formerly
but
facilitated
its
execution
to
the
utmost
of
his
ability
under
these
circumstances
it
was
not
surprising
that
earnest
application
soon
procured
his
admission
to
the
bar
his
efforts
were
redoubled
and
ere
long
his
eloquence
obtained
for
him
a
connection
with
one
of
the
most
prominent
members
of
the
profession
the
world
wondered
at
this
complete
revolution
many
doubted
its
continuance
but
step
by
step
he
climbed
the
ladder
to
eminence
and
merited
the
applause
which
the
public
lavished
upon
him
success
only
inflamed
his
ambition
and
it
became
evident
he
aimed
at
political
renown
nature
had
fitted
him
for
the
political
arena
had
endowed
him
with
oratorical
powers
of
no
ordinary
stamp
and
though
long
dormant
they
were
not
impaired
by
his
inertia
it
was
fortunate
for
him
that
an
exciting
presidential
canvass
afforded
numerous
opportunities
for
the
development
of
these
and
at
its
close
he
found
himself
possessed
of
an
enviable
reputation
to
a
certain
extent
his
wife
was
elated
with
his
success
she
was
proud
of
his
acknowledged
talent
but
her
selfish
nature
was
utterly
incapable
of
the
tenderness
and
sincere
affection
he
demanded
their
alienation
was
complete
no
bickerings
disturbed
the
serene
atmosphere
of
their
home
because
mutual
indifference
precluded
the
necessity
graham
gave
parties
and
attended
them
rode
danced
spent
her
summers
at
fashionable
and
her
winters
in
a
round
of
folly
and
dissipation
while
her
husband
pursued
his
profession
careless
of
her
movements
and
rarely
in
her
company
in
the
conduct
the
circle
in
which
she
moved
saw
nothing
reprehensible
she
dressed
superbly
gave
elegant
entertainments
and
was
par
excellence
the
leader
of
true
she
was
quite
as
much
of
a
belle
as
any
young
lady
in
the
city
and
received
the
attentions
and
flattery
of
gentlemen
as
unreservedly
nay
delightedly
as
though
she
had
no
neglected
husband
and
child
at
home
who
had
claims
upon
her
put
this
sort
of
conjugal
indifference
was
in
vogue
and
as
she
frowned
down
or
smiled
up
some
family
laboriously
toiling
to
reach
her
circle
her
clique
blindly
followed
her
example
and
humored
her
whims
as
regarded
her
deportment
toward
her
husband
one
alteration
was
perceptible
she
respected
almost
feared
him
shrank
from
his
presence
and
generally
contrived
to
fill
the
house
with
company
when
she
was
for
short
intervals
at
home
he
ceased
to
upbraid
or
even
remonstrate
his
days
were
spent
in
the
courtroom
or
his
office
and
his
evenings
in
his
library
she
dressed
as
extravagantly
as
she
chose
he
made
no
comments
paid
her
accounts
and
grew
more
taciturn
and
abstracted
day
by
day
oh
woman
woman
when
will
you
sever
the
fetters
which
fashion
wealth
and
worldliness
have
bound
about
you
and
prove
yourselves
worthy
the
noble
mission
for
which
you
were
created
how
much
longer
will
heartless
soulless
wives
mothers
daughters
and
sisters
waltz
round
the
consuming
flame
of
fashion
and
by
neglecting
their
duties
and
deserting
their
sphere
drive
their
husbands
sons
and
brothers
out
into
the
world
reckless
and
depraved
with
callous
hearts
irrevocably
laid
on
the
altars
of
mammon
god
help
the
women
of
america
grant
them
the
true
womanly
instincts
which
in
the
dawn
of
our
republic
made
home
the
eden
the
acme
of
all
human
hopes
and
joys
teach
them
that
gilded
saloons
with
their
accompanying
allurements
of
french
latitude
in
dress
and
dancing
and
the
manners
and
style
of
conversation
which
in
less
degenerate
times
would
have
branded
with
disgrace
and
infamy
all
who
indulged
it
teach
them
that
all
these
tend
to
the
depths
of
social
evil
and
oh
lead
them
back
to
the
hearthstone
that
holy
post
which
too
many
alas
have
deserted
eugene
graham
love
and
tenderness
were
all
bestowed
on
his
daughter
a
beautiful
child
not
yet
five
years
old
the
sole
companion
of
the
hours
spent
at
home
she
became
his
idol
it
was
one
sunny
afternoon
that
he
finished
copying
some
papers
necessary
in
a
case
to
be
defended
the
following
day
the
sunshine
stealing
through
the
shutters
fell
on
his
lofty
brow
pale
from
continued
study
his
whole
countenance
bespoke
a
nature
saddened
vexed
but
resolute
and
leaning
forward
he
touched
the
as
he
did
so
there
came
quick
footsteps
pattering
along
the
hall
the
door
was
pushed
open
and
a
little
fairy
form
with
a
head
of
rich
auburn
ringlets
peeped
in
cautiously
while
a
sweet
childish
voice
asked
eagerly
may
i
come
now
father
have
you
done
writing
i
wo
make
a
noise
indeed
i
wo
the
gloom
fled
from
his
face
and
he
held
out
his
arms
to
her
saying
i
have
done
writing
you
may
come
now
my
darling
she
sprang
into
his
lap
and
threw
her
little
snowy
arms
about
his
neck
kissing
him
rapturously
and
passing
her
fragile
fingers
through
his
hair
she
resembled
him
closely
having
the
same
classical
contour
and
large
soft
dark
eyes
he
returned
her
caresses
with
an
expression
of
almost
adoring
fondness
stroking
her
curls
with
a
light
gentle
touch
the
evening
was
warm
and
large
drops
stood
on
his
forehead
she
noticed
it
and
standing
on
his
knee
took
the
corner
of
her
tiny
embroidered
apron
and
wiped
away
the
moisture
kissing
the
forehead
as
she
did
so
a
servant
looked
in
at
the
door
did
you
ring
sir
yes
tell
philip
i
want
my
buggy
oh

going
to
ride

looked
at
him
earnestly

wo

with
me
my
darling
he
bent
down
to
kiss
her
coral
lips
and
just
then
graham
swept
into
the
room
she
was
attired
in
an
elegant
riding
habit
of
dark
purple
while
a
velvet
hat
of
the
same
color
with
a
long
drooping
plume
shaded
her
face
her
hands
were
incased
in
delicate
kid
gauntlets
which
fitted
with
perfect
exactness
she
was
a
beautiful
woman
and
the
costume
heightened
her
loveliness
she
started
slightly
on
perceiving
her
husband
and
said
hastily
i
thought
you
were
at
your
office
cornelia
what
on
earth
have
you
done
with
my
riding
whip

mischievous
little
wretch

it
once
before

i
am
waiting
for
it

this
instant

do
know
where

is
returned
the
child
making
no
effort
to
leave
her
father
arms
eugene
glanced
up
at
his
wife
his
eyes
wandered
over
her
becoming
and
beautiful
dress
then
went
back
to
the
sunny
face
of
his
child
an
angry
flush
dyed
antoinette
cheeks
as
she
observed
her
daughter
indifference
where
is
my
whip
i
say
flora
saw
you
with
it
yesterday

i
told

hands

cornelia
sobbing

the
angry
mother
shaking
her
hand
threateningly

it
asked
eugene
rising
with
the
child
in
his
arms
i
know
she
had
it
did
you
see
her
with
it
i
asked
you
no
but
flora
did
and
that
is
all
the
same
besides
i
here
is
the
whip
i
found
it
last
week
in
the
hall
behind
a
chair
and
put
it
in
the
cane
stand
the
last
time
you
went
to
ride
you
put
it
and
your
gloves
on
a
chair
in
the
hall
and
went
into
the
parlor
to
see
some
company
flora
picked
up
the
gloves
and
carried
them
upstairs
but
did
see
the
whip
john
the
servant
handed
her
a
small
whip
with
handle
inlaid
with
gold
it
is
no
such
thing
cried
graham
gathering
up
the
folds
of
her
habit
and
coloring
with
vexation
john
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
retired
and
his
mistress
sailed
out
to
the
front
door
where
her
horse
and
her
escort
awaited
her
run
and
get
your
hat
and
cape
cornelia
i
see
the
buggy
coming
round
the
corner
eugene
wiped
away
the
teardrops
glittering
on
her
rosy
cheeks
and
she
sprang
off
to
obey
him
while
in
the
interim
he
sent
for
flora
and
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
would
allow
no
repetition
of
the
deception
he
had
accidentally
discovered
the
maid
retired
highly
incensed
of
course
and
resolved
to
wreak
vengeance
on
both
john
and
cornelia
and
eugene
took
his
seat
in
the
buggy
in
no
particularly
amiable
mood
they
found
beulah
in
her
little
flower
gaiden
pruning
some
luxuriant
geraniums
she
threw
down
her
knife
and
hastened
to
meet
them
and
all
three
sat
down
on
the
steps
four
years
had
brought
sorrow
to
that
cottage
home
had
hushed
the
kind
accents
of
the
matron
stilled
the
true
heart
that
throbbed
so
tenderly
for
her
orphan
charge
and
had
seen
her
laid
to
rest
in
a
warm
grassy
slope
of
the
cemetery
she
died
peaceably
three
months
before
the
day
of
which
i
write
died
exhorting
eugene
and
beulah
so
to
pass
the
season
of
probation
that
they
might
be
reunited
beyond
the
grave
in
life
she
had
humbly
exemplified
the
teachings
of
our
saviour
and
her
death
was
a
triumphant
attestation
of
the
joy
and
hope
which
only
the
christian
religion
can
afford
in
the
final
hour
to
beulah
this
blow
was
peculiarly
severe
and
never
had
the
sense
of
her
orphanage
been
more
painfully
acute
than
when
she
returned
from
the
funeral
to
her
lonely
home
but
to
sorrow
her
nature
was
inured
she
had
learned
to
bear
grief
and
only
her
mourning
dress
and
subdued
manner
told
how
deeply
she
felt
this
trial
now
she
took
cornelia
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
fondly
while
the
child
returned
her
caresses
with
a
warmth
which
proved
how
sincerely
she
loved
her
may
i
have
some
flowers
auntie
cried
she
patting
beulah
pale
cheek
with
her
plump
dimpled
hands
yes
just
as
many
as
you
can
carry
home
go
gather
some
she
sprang
off
and
the
two
sat
watching
the
flutter
of
her
white
dress
among
the
she
piled
her
little
apron
as
full
as
possible
and
came
back
panting
and
delighted
beulah
looked
down
at
the
beautiful
beaming
face
and
twining
one
of
the
silky
curls
over
her
finger
said
musingly
eugene
she
always
reminds
me
of
lilly
do
you
see
the
resemblance
not
in
her
features
in
size
and
gay
heedlessness
of
manner
she
is
like
lilly
as
i
saw
her
last
yes
lilly
eyes
were
blue
and
your
child
are
dark
like
your
own
but
she
never
comes
up
and
puts
her
arms
round
my
neck
without
recalling
bygone
years
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
fancy
my
lost
darling
was
once
more
mine
ah
how
carefully
memory
gathers
up
the
golden
links
of
childhood
and
weaves
the
chain
that
binds
our
hearts
to
the
olden
time
sometimes
i
think
i
am
only
dreaming
and
shall
wake
to
a
happy
reality
if
i
could
have
lilly
back
oh
what
a
sunshine
it
would
shed
over
my
heart
and
life
but
this
may
not
be
and
i
can
only
love
cornelia
instead
her
long
black
lashes
were
weighed
down
with
unshed
tears
and
there
was
a
touching
sadness
in
her
low
voice
cornelia
stood
by
her
side
busily
engaged
in
dressing
beulah
hair
with
some
of
the
roses
and
scarlet
geranium
she
had
gathered
she
noticed
the
unusual
melancholy
written
in
the
quiet
face
and
said
impatiently
with
all
my
flowers
you
wo
look
gay
it
must
be
this
black
dress
do
wear
such
ugly
dark
things
i
wish
you
would
i
want
to
see
you
look
beautiful
like
mother
cornelia
go
and
break
that
cluster
of
yellow
berries
yonder
said
her
father
and
when
she
had
left
them
he
turned
to
his
companion
and
asked
beulah
have
you
reflected
on
what
i
said
the
last
time
i
saw
you
yes
eugene
with
what
result
my
former
decision
is
only
confirmed
the
more
i
ponder
the
subject
you
have
seen
nothing
of
reginald
then
he
was
here
on
some
legal
business
last
week
no
he
has
been
in
the
city
several
times
during
the
last
four
years
but
never
comes
here
and
except
that
one
letter
which
i
did
not
answer
i
have
heard
nothing
from
him
i
doubt
whether
we
ever
meet
again
you
are
a
strange
woman
such
devotion
as
his
would
have
won
any
other
being
he
is
as
much
attached
to
you
now
as
the
day
he
first
offered
you
his
hand
upon
my
word
your
obstinacy
provokes
me
he
is
the
noblest
man
i
ever
knew
everything
that
i
should
suppose
a
woman
of
your
nature
would
admire
and
yet
year
after
year
you
remain
apparently
as
indifferent
as
ever
and
it
were
a
miserable
return
for
such
unmerited
love
to
marry
him
merely
from
gratitude
i
do
admire
him
but
can
not
marry
him
i
told
him
so
four
years
ago
but
why
did
you
not
at
least
answer
his
letter
because
his
acceptance
was
made
the
condition
of
an
answer
a
negative
one
was
not
expected
and
i
had
no
other
to
give
pardon
me
beulah
but
why
do
you
not
love
him
a
strange
question
truly
my
heart
is
not
the
tool
of
my
will
beulah
do
you
intend
to
spend
your
life
solitary
and
joyless
cut
off
as
you
are
here
from
society
and
dependent
on
books
and
music
for
sympathy
why
will
you
not
marry
reginald
and
make
his
home
happy
eugene
i
have
told
you
before
that
i
could
not
accept
him
and
told
you
why
let
the
subject
drop
it
is
an
unpleasant
one
to
me
i
am
happier
here
than
i
could
possibly
be
anywhere
else
think
you
i
would
marry
merely
for
an
elegant
home
and
an
intellectual
companion
never
i
will
live
and
die
here
in
this
little
cottage
rather
than
quit
it
with
such
motives
you
are
mistaken
in
supposing
that
lindsay
is
still
attached
to
me
it
has
been
nearly
two
years
since
he
wrote
that
letter
and
from
georgia
i
hear
that
the
world
believes
he
is
soon
to
marry
a
lady
residing
somewhere
near
him
i
think
it
more
than
probable
the
report
is
true
and
hope
most
sincerely
it
may
be
so
now
eugene
do
mention
the
subject
again
will
you
it
is
generally
believed
that
he
will
be
elected
to
congress
next
month
will
decide
it
the
chances
are
all
in
his
favor
persisted
eugene
yes
so
i
judged
from
the
papers
said
she
coolly
and
then
added
and
one
day
i
hope
to
see
you
or
rather
hear
of
you
in
washington
by
his
side
i
believe
i
shall
be
gratified
and
oh
eugene
what
a
proud
moment
it
will
be
to
me
how
i
shall
rejoice
in
your
merited
eminence
her
face
kindled
as
she
spoke
but
the
shadows
deepened
in
his
countenance
as
he
answered
moodily
perhaps
i
may
but
fame
and
position
can
not
lighten
a
loaded
heart
or
kindle
the
sacred
flame
of
love
in
a
dreary
home
when
a
man
blindly
wrecks
his
happiness
on
the
threshold
of
life
by
a
fatal
marriage
no
after
exertion
can
atone
or
rectify
the
one
mistake
hush
she
will
hear
you
said
beulah
pointing
to
the
little
girl
who
was
slowly
approaching
them
a
bitter
smile
parted
his
lips
she
is
my
all
yet
precious
as
she
is
to
my
sad
heart
i
would
gladly
lay
her
in
her
grave
sooner
than
see
her
live
to
marry
an
uncongenial
spirit
or
know
that
her
radiant
face
was
clouded
with
sorrow
like
mine
god
grant
that
her
father
wretched
lot
may
warn
her
of
the
quicksands
which
nearly
ingulfed
him
he
took
the
child
in
his
arms
as
if
to
shield
her
from
some
impending
danger
and
said
hurriedly
are
you
ready
to
go
home
is
it
so
very
late
it
is
time
we
were
going
back
i
think
beulah
tied
on
the
hat
and
cape
which
had
been
thrown
aside
and
saw
them
ride
away
there
in
the
golden
twilight
she
mused
on
the
changes
time
bore
on
its
swift
chariot
the
gorgeous
dreamings
of
her
girlhood
had
faded
like
the
summer
clouds
above
her
to
the
somber
hue
of
reality
from
the
hour
when
her
father
a
poor
artist
toiling
over
canvas
to
feed
his
children
had
in
dying
accents
committed
the
two
to
care
she
only
remembered
sorrow
up
to
the
time
that
hartwell
took
her
to
his
home
her
life
there
was
the
one
bright
oasis
in
her
desert
past
then
she
left
it
a
woman
and
began
the
long
struggle
with
poverty
and
trials
over
again
in
addition
skepticism
threw
its
icy
shadow
over
her
she
had
toiled
in
the
cavernous
mines
of
metaphysics
hopelessly
and
finally
returning
to
the
holy
religion
of
jesus
christ
her
weary
spirit
found
rest
ah
that
rest
which
only
the
exhausted
wanderer
through
the
burning
wastes
of
speculation
can
truly
comprehend
and
appreciate
she
had
been
ambitious
and
labored
to
obtain
distinction
as
a
writer
and
this
under
various
fictitious
signatures
was
hers
she
still
studied
and
wrote
but
with
another
aim
now
than
mere
desire
of
literary
fame
wrote
to
warn
others
of
the
snares
in
which
she
had
so
long
been
entangled
and
to
point
young
seekers
after
truth
to
the
only
sure
fountain
she
was
very
lonely
but
not
unhappy
georgia
and
helen
were
both
happily
married
and
she
saw
them
very
rarely
but
their
parents
were
still
her
counselors
and
friends
at
death
they
had
urged
her
to
remove
to
their
house
but
she
preferred
remaining
at
the
little
cottage
at
least
until
the
expiration
of
the
year
she
still
kept
her
place
in
the
schoolroom
not
now
as
assistant
but
as
principal
in
that
department
and
the
increased
salary
rendered
rigid
economy
and
music
lessons
no
longer
necessary
her
intense
love
of
beauty
whether
found
in
nature
or
art
was
a
constant
source
of
pleasure
books
music
painting
flowers
all
contributed
largely
to
her
happiness
the
grim
puzzles
of
philosophy
no
longer
perplexed
her
mind
sometimes
they
thrust
themselves
before
her
threatening
as
the
sphinx
of
old
but
she
knew
that
here
they
were
insolvable
that
at
least
her
reason
was
no
oedipus
and
a
genuine
philosophy
induced
her
to
put
them
aside
and
anchoring
her
hopes
of
god
and
eternity
in
the
religion
of
christ
she
drew
from
the
beautiful
world
in
which
she
lived
much
pure
enjoyment
once
she
had
worshiped
the
universe
now
she
looked
beyond
the
wonderful
temple
whose
architecture
from
its
lowest
foundations
of
rock
to
its
starry
dome
of
sky
proclaimed
the
god
of
revelation
and
loving
its
beauty
and
grandeur
felt
that
it
was
but
a
home
for
a
season
where
the
soul
could
be
fitted
for
yet
more
perfect
her
face
reflected
the
change
which
a
calm
reliance
on
god
had
wrought
in
her
feelings
the
restless
anxious
expression
had
given
place
to
quiet
the
eyes
had
lost
their
strained
troubled
look
the
brow
was
unruffled
the
face
serene
serene
reader
but
not
happy
and
sparkling
as
it
might
have
been
all
the
shadows
were
not
yet
banished
from
her
heart
there
was
one
spectral
form
which
thrust
itself
continually
before
her
and
kept
her
cheek
pale
and
rendered
her
lip
at
times
unsteady
she
had
struggled
bravely
against
this
one
remaining
sorrow
but
as
time
rolled
on
its
power
and
influence
only
increased
even
now
in
this
quiet
hour
when
a
holy
hush
had
fallen
on
all
nature
and
twilight
wrapped
its
soft
purple
veil
around
her
this
haunting
memory
came
to
stir
the
depths
of
her
heart
charon
walked
slowly
up
the
steps
and
lying
down
at
her
feet
nestled
his
head
against
her
then
fancy
painted
a
dreary
picture
which
seemed
all
dark
and
red
a
tract
of
sand
and
someone
pacing
there
alone
who
paced
forever
in
a
glimmering
land
lit
with
a
low
large
moon
it
was
the
thought
of
a
lonely
man
wandering
without
aim
or
goal
in
deserts
away
from
home
and
friends
joyless
hopeless
one
who
was
dearer
to
her
than
all
on
earth
beside
who
had
left
her
in
anger
and
upon
whose
loved
face
she
might
look
no
more
for
three
years
no
tidings
had
come
of
his
wanderings
none
knew
his
fate
and
perhaps
even
then
his
proud
head
lay
low
beneath
the
palms
of
the
orient
or
was
pillowed
on
the
coral
crags
of
distant
seas
this
thought
was
one
she
was
unable
to
endure
her
features
quivered
her
hands
grasped
each
other
in
a
paroxysm
of
dread
apprehension
and
while
a
deep
groan
burst
from
her
lips
she
bowed
her
face
on
the
head
of
his
last
charge
his
parting
gift
the
consciousness
of
his
unbelief
tortured
her
even
in
eternity
they
might
meet
no
more
and
this
fear
cost
her
hours
of
agony
such
as
no
other
trial
had
ever
inflicted
from
the
moment
of
her
return
to
the
bible
and
to
prayer
this
struggle
began
and
for
three
years
she
had
knelt
morning
and
evening
and
entreated
almighty
god
to
shield
and
guide
the
wanderer
to
scatter
the
mists
of
unbelief
which
shrouded
his
mind
constantly
her
prayers
went
up
mingled
with
tears
and
sobs
and
as
weary
months
wore
on
the
petitions
grew
more
impassioned
her
anxiety
increased
daily
and
finally
it
became
the
one
intense
absorbing
wish
of
her
heart
to
see
her
guardian
again
his
gloom
his
bitterness
were
all
forgotten
she
only
remembered
his
unceasing
care
and
kindness
his
noble
generosity
his
brilliant
smile
which
was
bestowed
only
on
her
pressing
her
face
against
charon
head
she
murmured
pleadingly
oh
father
protect
him
from
suffering
and
death
guide
him
safely
home
give
me
my
guardian
back
oh
father
give
me
my
wandering
friend
once
more
chapter
xxxvii
fold
that
coat
for
me
my
dear
there
give
it
to
me
i
believe
there
is
room
in
this
trunk
for
it
asbury
took
one
of
her
husband
coats
from
beulah
hand
and
carefully
packed
it
away
how
long
will
you
be
absent
do
you
suppose
probably
not
longer
than
a
month
the
doctor
thinks
a
few
days
at
saratoga
will
invigorate
him
if
you
had
consented
to
go
we
had
intended
spending
a
week
at
niagara
i
am
sorry
you
will
not
go
beulah
you
would
enjoy
the
trip
and
moreover
the
change
would
benefit
you
why
do
you
so
pertinaciously
reject
that
legacy
of
cornelia
the
money
has
been
in
my
husband
hands
for
some
years
untouched
and
graham
said
not
long
since
that
you
might
just
as
well
accept
it
for
he
would
never
receive
a
cent
of
it
in
return
the
original
sum
has
been
considerably
augmented
by
judicious
investments
and
would
place
you
above
the
necessity
of
labor
if
you
would
accept
it
your
refusal
wounds
graham
he
told
me
so
last
week
it
was
cornelia
particular
request
that
you
should
have
that
amount
and
he
is
anxious
to
see
you
in
possession
of
it
i
told
him
of
your
suggestion
that
he
should
add
this
legacy
to
the
sum
already
given
to
the
asylum
but
he
vowed
solemnly
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
if
you
chose
to
give
it
to
the
asylum
you
could
do
so
of
course
the
money
was
yours
he
never
would
touch
a
cent
of
it
beulah
if
you
will
not
think
me
officious
i
will
say
candidly
that
i
think
you
ought
to
accept
it
that
is
use
it
for
the
legacy
has
been
left
whether
you
employ
it
or
not
beulah
looked
grave
and
troubled
but
made
no
reply
asbury
finished
packing
the
trunk
locked
it
and
turning
toward
the
door
said
i
am
going
upstairs
to
see
about
the
furniture
in
that
room
which
georgia
calls
the
gallery
come
with
me
my
dear
she
led
the
way
and
beulah
followed
until
they
reached
a
large
apartment
in
the
third
story
the
door
of
which
asbury
unlocked
as
they
entered
beulah
started
on
seeing
the
statuary
and
paintings
with
which
she
was
so
familiar
in
former
years
and
in
one
corner
of
the
room
stood
the
melodeon
carefully
covered
a
quantity
of
tissue
paper
lay
on
the
floor
and
asbury
began
to
cover
the
paintings
by
pinning
the
sheets
together
beulah
took
off
her
gloves
and
assisted
there
was
silence
for
some
time
but
on
lifting
a
piece
of
drapery
asbury
exposed
the
face
of
a
portrait
which
beulah
recognized
from
the
peculiarity
of
the
frame
as
the
one
that
had
hung
over
the
mantel
in
her
guardian
study
paper
and
pins
fell
from
her
fingers
and
drawing
a
deep
breath
she
gazed
upon
the
face
she
had
so
long
desired
to
see
she
traced
a
slight
resemblance
to
antoinette
in
the
faultless
features
the
countenance
was
surpassingly
beautiful
it
was
a
young
girlish
face
sparkling
with
joyousness
bewitching
in
its
wonderful
loveliness
the
eloquent
eyes
were
strangely
almost
wildly
brilliant
the
full
crimson
lips
possessed
that
rare
outline
one
sees
in
old
pictures
and
the
cheek
tinted
like
a
rested
on
one
delicate
dimpled
hand
beulah
looked
and
grew
dizzy
this
was
his
wife
this
the
portrait
he
had
kept
shrouded
so
long
and
so
carefully
how
he
must
have
worshiped
that
radiant
young
bride
asbury
noticed
her
emotion
and
asked
with
some
surprise
did
you
never
see
this
before
no
it
was
always
covered
and
hung
too
high
for
me
to
lift
the
crape
beulah
eyes
were
riveted
on
the
canvas
asbury
watched
her
a
moment
and
said
it
is
an
undetermined
question
in
my
mind
whether
beauty
such
as
this
is
not
a
curse
in
this
instance
assuredly
it
proved
so
for
it
wrecked
the
happiness
of
both
husband
and
wife
my
dear
child
do
you
know
your
guardian
history
i
know
nothing
of
him
save
that
he
is
my
best
friend
when
i
first
saw
guy
hartwell
he
was
one
of
the
noblest
men
i
ever
met
commanding
universal
admiration
and
esteem
it
was
before
his
marriage
he
was
remarkably
handsome
as
you
can
readily
imagine
he
must
have
been
and
his
manners
possessed
a
singular
fascination
for
all
who
came
within
the
circle
of
his
acquaintance
even
now
after
the
lapse
of
ten
years
i
remember
his
musical
ringing
laugh
a
laugh
i
have
never
heard
since
his
family
were
aristocratic
and
wealthy
and
guy
was
his
mother
idol
she
was
a
haughty
imperious
woman
and
her
as
she
fondly
termed
him
was
her
pride
his
only
sister
chilton
or
rather
lockhart
was
his
senior
and
he
had
a
younger
brother
harry
who
was
extremely
wild
ran
away
from
home
and
spent
most
of
his
time
at
sea
guy
was
naturally
of
a
happy
genial
temperament
fond
of
study
fond
of
art
flowers
poetry
everything
that
was
noble
and
beautiful
that
could
minister
to
highly
cultivated
tastes
chilton
was
unfortunate
in
his
speculations
lost
his
fortune
and
died
soon
after
pauline
birth
leaving
his
wife
and
child
dependent
on
her
mother
and
brother
may
and
the
old
lady
often
disagreed
and
only
guy
could
harmonize
their
discords
during
a
visit
to
new
orleans
he
accidentally
met
the
original
of
this
portrait
her
family
were
almost
destitute
but
he
aided
them
very
liberally
she
was
very
beautiful
and
in
an
unlucky
hour
he
determined
to
marry
her
she
was
a
mere
child
and
he
placed
her
for
a
while
at
a
school
where
she
enjoyed
every
educational
advantage
he
was
completely
fascinated
seemed
to
think
only
of
creola
and
hastened
the
marriage
his
mother
and
sister
bitterly
opposed
the
match
ridiculed
his
humble
and
portionless
bride
but
he
persisted
and
brought
her
here
a
beautiful
heedless
girl
guy
built
that
house
and
his
mother
and
sister
occupied
one
near
him
which
was
burnt
before
you
knew
anything
about
them
of
course
his
wife
went
constantly
into
society
and
before
six
months
elapsed
poor
guy
discovered
that
he
had
made
a
fatal
mistake
she
did
not
love
him
had
married
him
merely
for
the
sake
of
an
elegant
home
and
money
to
lavish
as
her
childish
whims
dictated
ah
beulah
it
makes
my
heart
ache
to
think
of
the
change
this
discovery
wrought
in
guy
nature
he
was
a
proud
man
naturally
but
now
he
became
repulsive
cold
and
austere
the
revolution
in
his
deportment
and
appearance
was
almost
incredible
his
wife
was
recklessly
imprudent
and
launched
into
the
wildest
excesses
which
society
sanctioned
when
he
endeavored
to
restrain
her
she
rebelled
and
without
his
knowledge
carried
on
a
flirtation
with
one
whom
she
had
known
previous
to
her
marriage
i
believe
she
was
innocent
in
her
folly
and
merely
thoughtlessly
fed
her
vanity
with
the
adulation
excited
by
her
beauty
poor
child
she
might
have
learned
discretion
but
unfortunately
chilton
had
always
detested
her
and
now
watching
her
movements
she
discovered
creola
clandestine
meetings
with
the
gentleman
whom
her
husband
had
forbidden
her
to
recognize
as
an
acquaintance
instead
of
exerting
herself
to
rectify
the
difficulties
in
her
brother
home
she
apparently
exulted
in
the
possession
of
facts
which
allowed
her
to
taunt
him
with
his
imprudence
and
indifference
he
denied
the
truth
of
her
assertions
she
dared
him
to
watch
her
conduct
and
obtained
a
note
which
enabled
him
to
return
home
one
day
at
an
unusually
early
hour
and
meet
the
man
he
had
denounced
in
his
own
parlor
guy
ordered
him
out
of
the
house
and
without
addressing
his
wife
rode
back
to
see
his
patients
but
that
night
he
learned
from
her
that
before
he
ever
met
her
an
engagement
existed
between
herself
and
the
man
he
so
detested
he
was
poor
and
her
mother
had
persuaded
her
to
marry
guy
for
his
fortune
she
seemed
to
grow
frantic
cursed
the
hour
of
her
marriage
professed
sincere
attachment
to
the
other
and
i
firmly
believe
became
insane
from
that
moment
then
and
there
they
parted
creola
returned
to
her
mother
but
died
suddenly
a
few
weeks
after
leaving
her
husband
they
had
been
married
but
a
year
i
have
always
thought
her
mind
diseased
and
it
was
rumored
that
her
mother
died
insane
doubtless
guy
terrible
rage
drove
her
to
desperation
though
he
certainly
had
cause
to
upbraid
i
have
often
feared
that
he
would
meet
the
object
of
his
hatred
and
once
and
only
once
afterward
that
man
came
to
the
city
why
i
never
knew
but
my
husband
told
me
that
he
saw
him
at
a
concert
here
some
years
ago
poor
guy
how
he
suffered
yet
how
silently
he
bore
it
how
completely
he
sheathed
his
heart
of
fire
in
icy
vestments
he
never
alluded
to
the
affair
in
the
remotest
manner
never
saw
her
after
that
night
he
was
sitting
in
our
library
waiting
to
see
my
husband
when
he
happened
to
open
the
letter
announcing
her
death
i
was
the
only
person
present
and
noticed
that
a
change
passed
over
his
countenance
i
spoke
to
him
but
he
did
not
reply
i
touched
him
but
he
took
no
notice
whatever
and
sat
for
at
least
an
hour
without
moving
a
muscle
or
uttering
a
word
finally
george
came
and
spoke
to
him
appealingly
he
looked
up
and
smiled
oh
what
a
smile
may
i
never
see
such
another
it
will
haunt
me
while
i
live
without
a
word
he
folded
the
letter
replaced
it
in
the
envelope
and
left
us
soon
after
his
mother
died
and
he
went
immediately
to
europe
he
was
absent
two
years
and
came
back
so
stern
so
cynical
so
unlike
his
former
self
i
scarcely
knew
him
chilton
took
charge
of
his
house
from
the
hour
of
his
separation
from
creola
but
they
were
not
congenial
he
was
vastly
her
superior
save
in
intellect
which
none
of
the
hartwell
family
ever
lacked
my
husband
is
very
much
attached
to
guy
thinks
he
has
not
an
equal
yet
mourns
over
the
blight
which
fell
upon
him
in
the
very
morn
of
his
glorious
manhood
about
a
year
after
his
return
from
europe
he
took
you
to
his
house
as
an
adopted
child
i
wondered
at
it
for
i
knew
how
imbittered
his
whole
soul
had
become
but
the
heart
must
have
an
idol
he
was
desolate
and
miserable
and
took
you
home
to
have
something
to
love
and
interest
him
you
never
knew
him
in
the
prime
of
his
being
for
though
comparatively
young
in
years
he
had
grown
prematurely
old
in
feeling
before
you
saw
him
poor
guy
may
a
merciful
and
loving
god
preserve
him
wherever
he
may
be
and
bring
him
to
a
knowledge
of
that
religion
which
alone
can
comfort
a
nature
like
his
so
noble
so
gifted
yet
so
injured
so
imbittered
she
brushed
away
the
tears
that
stood
on
her
cheeks
and
looked
sorrowfully
at
the
portrait
of
the
unfortunate
young
wife
beulah
sat
with
her
face
partially
averted
and
her
eyes
shaded
with
her
hand
once
or
twice
her
lips
moved
and
a
shiver
ran
over
her
she
looked
up
and
said
abruptly
leave
the
key
of
this
room
with
me
will
you
i
should
like
to
come
here
occasionally
certainly
come
as
often
as
you
choose
and
here
on
this
bunch
is
the
key
of
the
melodeon
take
it
also
the
instrument
needs
dusting
i
dare
say
for
it
has
never
been
opened
since
guy
left
nearly
five
years
ago
there
the
clock
struck
two
and
the
boat
leaves
at
four
there
too
is
my
husband
step
come
my
dear
we
must
go
down
take
these
keys
until
i
return
she
gave
them
to
her
and
they
descended
to
the
dining
room
where
the
doctor
awaited
them
beulah
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
next
year
you
must
not
think
of
living
in
that
cottage
alone
since
death
you
should
abandon
the
thought
of
keeping
house
it
will
not
do
child
for
you
to
live
there
by
yourself
so
said
the
doctor
a
short
time
before
he
bade
her
adieu
i
do
know
yet
what
i
shall
do
i
am
puzzled
about
a
home
you
need
not
be
come
and
live
in
my
house
as
i
begged
you
to
do
long
ago
alice
and
i
will
be
heartily
glad
to
have
you
child
why
should
you
hesitate
i
prefer
a
home
of
my
own
if
circumstances
permitted
it
you
and
asbury
have
been
very
kind
in
tendering
me
a
home
in
your
house
and
i
do
most
sincerely
thank
you
both
for
your
friendly
interest
but
i
oh
beulah
i
should
be
so
very
glad
to
have
you
always
with
me
my
dear
child
come
asbury
passed
her
arm
affectionately
around
the
girl
waist
beulah
looked
at
her
with
trembling
lips
and
said
hastily
will
you
take
me
as
a
boarder
i
would
rather
take
you
as
a
friend
as
a
daughter
not
a
bit
of
it
alice
she
shall
pay
the
highest
possible
board
do
imagine
miss
independence
that
i
expected
for
a
moment
to
offer
you
a
home
gratis
pay
board
that
you
shall
always
in
advance
and
candles
and
fires
and
the
use
of
my
library
and
the
benefit
of
my
explanations
and
conversation
charged
as
cried
the
doctor
shaking
his
fist
at
her
then
sir
i
engage
rooms
will
you
really
come
my
child
asked
asbury
kissing
the
orphan
pale
cheek
tenderly
gladly
as
a
boarder
and
very
grateful
for
such
a
privilege
beulah
on
reflection
i
think
i
can
possibly
take
charon
for
price
though
i
must
confess
to
numerous
qualms
of
conscience
at
the
bare
suggestion
of
receiving
such
an
character
into
my
household
thank
you
said
she
and
saw
them
depart
for
saratoga
whither
georgia
and
helen
had
preceded
them
several
weeks
elapsed
without
her
receiving
any
tidings
and
then
a
letter
came
giving
her
information
of
a
severe
illness
which
had
attacked
the
doctor
immediately
after
his
arrival
in
new
york
he
was
convalescing
rapidly
when
his
wife
wrote
and
in
proof
thereof
subjoined
a
postscript
in
his
scrawling
hand
and
wonted
bantering
style
beulah
laughed
over
it
refolded
the
letter
and
went
into
her
little
garden
to
gather
a
bouquet
for
one
of
her
pupils
who
had
recently
been
quite
sick
she
wore
a
white
muslin
apron
over
her
black
dress
and
soon
filled
it
with
verbena
roses
and
geranium
sprigs
sitting
down
on
the
steps
she
began
to
arrange
them
and
soon
became
absorbed
in
her
occupation
presently
a
shadow
fell
on
the
step
she
glanced
up
and
the
flowers
dropped
from
her
fingers
while
an
exclamation
of
surprise
escaped
her
lindsay
held
out
his
hand
after
four
years
of
absence
of
separation
have
you
no
word
of
welcome
she
gave
him
both
hands
and
said
eagerly
oh
yes
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
again
very
glad
that
i
have
an
opportunity
of
congratulating
you
on
your
signal
success
i
am
heartily
glad
my
friend
is
soon
to
enter
congressional
halls
accept
my
most
sincere
congratulations
on
your
election
a
sudden
flush
rose
to
his
temples
and
clasping
her
hands
tightly
he
exclaimed
passionately
oh
beulah
your
congratulations
mock
me
i
come
to
offer
you
once
more
my
hand
my
heart
my
honors
if
i
have
any
i
have
waited
patiently
no
not
patiently
but
still
i
have
waited
for
some
token
of
remembrance
from
you
and
could
bear
my
suspense
no
longer
will
you
share
the
position
which
has
been
accorded
me
recently
will
you
give
me
this
hand
which
i
desire
more
intensely
than
the
united
honors
of
the
universe
beside
beulah
has
my
devoted
love
won
me
your
affection
will
you
go
with
me
to
washington
i
can
not
i
can
not
can
not
oh
beulah
i
would
make
you
a
happy
wife
if
it
cost
me
my
life
no
i
could
not
be
happy
as
your
wife
it
is
utterly
impossible
lindsay
i
told
you
long
ago
you
could
never
be
more
than
a
friend
and
have
years
wrought
no
change
in
your
heart
years
have
strengthened
my
esteem
my
sincere
friendship
but
more
than
this
all
time
can
not
accomplish
your
heart
is
tenacious
of
its
idol
he
answered
moodily
it
rebels
sir
now
as
formerly
at
the
thought
of
linking
my
destiny
with
that
of
one
whom
i
never
loved
beulah
spoke
rapidly
her
cheeks
burned
and
her
eyes
sparkled
with
displeasure
he
looked
at
her
and
sighed
deeply
then
threw
down
a
letter
saying
ah
beulah
i
understood
long
ago
why
you
could
not
love
me
but
i
hoped
years
of
absence
would
obliterate
the
memory
that
prevented
my
winning
you
i
made
unusual
exertions
to
discover
some
trace
of
your
wandering
guardian
have
written
constantly
to
my
former
banker
in
paris
to
find
some
clew
to
his
whereabouts
through
him
i
learn
that
your
friend
was
last
heard
of
at
canton
and
the
supposition
is
that
he
is
no
longer
living
i
do
not
wish
to
pain
you
beulah
but
i
would
fain
show
you
how
frail
a
hope
you
cling
to
believe
me
dear
beulah
i
am
not
so
selfish
as
to
rejoice
at
his
prolonged
absence
no
no
love
such
as
mine
prizes
the
happiness
of
its
object
above
all
other
things
were
it
in
my
power
i
would
restore
him
to
you
this
moment
i
had
hoped
you
would
learn
to
love
me
but
i
erred
in
judging
your
nature
henceforth
i
will
cast
off
this
hope
and
school
myself
to
regard
you
as
my
friend
only
i
have
at
least
deserved
your
friendship
and
it
is
inalienably
yours
cried
she
very
earnestly
in
future
when
toiling
to
discharge
my
duties
i
may
believe
i
have
one
sincere
friend
who
will
rejoice
at
my
success
of
this
you
may
well
rest
assured
it
seems
a
poor
return
lindsay
for
all
you
have
tendered
me
but
it
is
the
most
i
can
give
the
most
an
honest
heart
will
allow
me
to
offer
truly
you
may
always
claim
my
friendship
and
esteem
if
it
has
any
worth
i
prize
it
far
more
than
your
hand
unaccompanied
by
your
heart
henceforth
we
will
speak
of
the
past
no
more
only
let
me
be
the
friend
an
orphan
may
require
you
are
to
live
in
my
uncle
house
i
believe
i
am
very
glad
you
have
decided
to
do
so
this
is
not
a
proper
home
for
you
now
how
do
you
contrive
to
exorcise
loneliness
i
do
not
always
succeed
very
well
my
flowers
are
a
great
resource
i
do
know
how
i
should
live
without
them
my
books
too
serve
to
occupy
my
attention
she
was
making
a
great
effort
to
seem
cheerful
but
he
saw
that
her
smile
was
forced
and
with
an
assurance
that
he
would
see
her
again
before
he
went
to
washington
he
shook
hands
cordially
and
left
her
she
tied
her
bouquet
and
dispatched
it
to
the
sick
child
with
a
few
lines
of
kind
remembrance
then
took
the
letter
which
lindsay
had
thrown
on
the
steps
and
opened
it
with
trembling
fingers
lindsay

as
i
wrote

accidentally
learned
that

been

been
unable
to

chapter
xxxviii
one
day
there
came
a
letter
postmarked
from
an
inland
town
where
beulah
had
no
correspondent
the
direction
however
was
instantly
recognized
and
she
broke
the
seal
hurriedly
what
has
become
of
you
beulah
and
what
can
have
become
of
my
two
letters
which
were
never
answered
concluding
you
never
received
them
i
hazard
a
third
attempt
to
reach
you
through
the
medium
of
letters
you
will
readily
perceive
that
we
have
removed
to
a
distant
section
of
the
state
ernest
was
called
to
take
charge
of
this
parish
and
we
are
delightfully
located
here
within
a
few
walk
of
the
church
beulah
the
storm
which
darkened
over
me
in
the
first
year
of
my
marriage
has
swept
by
and
it
is
all
sunshine
glorious
sunshine
with
me
you
know
my
home
was
very
unhappy
for
a
time
my
husband
family
caused
misunderstandings
between
us
influenced
him
against
me
and
made
me
very
very
wretched
i
could
not
tolerate
lucy
presence
with
any
degree
of
patience
yet
she
would
remain
in
our
house
how
it
would
have
ended
only
heaven
knows
had
not
my
husband
been
suddenly
taken
very
it
was
on
sabbath
morning
he
was
displeased
with
me
because
of
some
of
my
disputes
with
his
sister
and
scarcely
spoke
to
me
before
he
went
into
the
pulpit
lucy
and
i
sat
together
in
the
pew
hating
each
other
cordially
and
when
ernest
began
the
morning
service
i
noticed
he
looked
pale
and
weary
before
it
was
concluded
he
sank
back
exhausted
and
was
borne
into
the
vestry
room
covered
with
blood
he
had
a
severe
hemorrhage
from
the
throat
his
physician
said
but
ernest
thinks
it
was
from
his
lungs
i
was
sure
he
would
die
and
oh
beulah
what
agony
i
endured
as
i
sat
beside
him
and
watched
his
ghastly
face
but
his
illness
was
blessing
in
disguise
he
forgot
all
our
disgraceful
bickerings
and
was
never
satisfied
unless
i
was
with
him
lucy
grumbled
and
sneered
and
looked
sour
but
i
had
my
husband
heart
again
and
determined
to
keep
it
as
soon
as
he
was
strong
enough
i
told
him
how
wretched
i
had
been
and
how
sincerely
i
desired
to
make
him
happy
if
lucy
would
only
not
interfere
he
saw
that
our
domestic
peace
was
dependent
upon
the
change
and
from
that
hour
his
sister
ceased
meddling
with
my
affairs
what
he
said
to
her
i
never
knew
but
soon
after
his
recovery
she
returned
to
her
parents
and
i
was
left
in
peace
i
began
in
sober
earnest
to
be
all
my
husband
wished
me
read
the
books
he
liked
though
it
was
a
terrible
bore
at
first
read
to
him
took
part
in
all
the
societies
connected
with
his
church
and
in
short
became
quite
a
demure
pastor
wife
occasionally
my
old
fondness
for
fun
would
break
out
to
the
horror
of
some
of
his
antediluvian
flock
but
ernest
was
very
good
and
bore
patiently
with
me
and
now
i
am
as
prim
and
precise
as
any
old
maid
of
sixty
at
home
i
do
as
i
like
that
is
when
ernest
likes
it
too
i
sing
and
play
and
romp
with
the
dogs
and
kittens
but
the
moment
the
door
bell
rings
lo
a
demure
matron
receives
her
guests
health
is
quite
restored
and
i
am
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
you
should
see
me
working
in
my
garden
and
sometimes
churning
before
breakfast
to
give
ernest
a
fresh
glass
of
buttermilk
i
would
not
change
places
with
an
empress
i
am
so
happy
my
husband
loves
me
better
than
everything
else
beside
and
what
more
could
i
desire
do
come
and
see
me
we
would
be
so
delighted
to
have
you
spend
some
time
in
our
home
i
am
such
a
genuine
rustic
you
would
scarcely
recognize
me
just
fancy
me
with
an
apron
on
my
sleeves
rolled
up
churning
as
fast
as
the
dasher
can
fly
and
singing
at
the
top
of
my
voice
mother
was
perfectly
shocked
when
she
first
came
to
live
with
me
and
vowed
i
should
not
make
a
of
myself
drudge
indeed
because
i
chose
to
do
something
with
my
own
hands
for
my
husband
i
told
her
i
would
as
she
called
it
just
as
long
as
ernest
loved
such
things
as
i
could
prepare
for
him
myself
and
i
read
her
those
famous
remarks
of
lady
mary
montagu
in
which
all
domestic
pursuits
even
cooking
are
dignified
as
a
labor
of
love
whereupon
ernest
gave
me
a
kiss
and
mother
declined
any
further
argumentation
on
the
subject
how
some
of
my
fashionable
city
friends
would
elevate
their
fastidious
noses
at
seeing
me
with
my
check
aprons
picking
strawberries
or
arranging
curds
for
tea
come
and
see
me
do
beulah
i
am
the
very
happiest
woman
extant
that
is
i
would
be
if
i
could
only
know
something
of
uncle
guy
it
is
almost
five
years
since
he
left
home
and
for
a
long
long
time
we
have
heard
nothing
from
him
this
is
the
only
sorrow
i
have
sometimes
i
fear
he
must
have
died
in
some
distant
land
yet
will
not
believe
it
i
want
to
see
him
very
much
my
heart
aches
when
i
think
about
him
dear
uncle
guy
next
to
my
husband
i
believe
i
love
him
best
ca
you
tell
me
something
of
him
or
do
you
know
as
little
as
his
relatives
ernest
says
he
will
walk
into
our
house
some
day
without
any
intimation
of
his
coming
oh
i
hope
so
i
endeavor
to
believe
so
do
write
to
me
i
often
think
of
you
in
your
loneliness
and
wish
you
were
as
happy
as
your
friend
pauline
beulah
laid
the
letter
beside
one
received
the
previous
day
from
clara
and
mused
for
some
moments
they
were
both
happily
married
and
she
sincerely
rejoiced
over
their
fortunate
lots
but
clara
had
onced
loved
her
guardian
how
could
she
possibly
forget
him
so
entirely
was
love
a
mere
whim
of
the
hour
fostered
by
fortuitously
favorable
circumstances
but
chilled
and
vanquished
by
absence
or
obstacles
could
the
heart
demolish
the
idol
it
had
once
enshrined
and
set
up
another
image
for
worship
was
time
the
conquering
iconoclast
why
then
did
she
suffer
more
acutely
as
each
year
rolled
on
she
had
little
leisure
however
for
these
reflections
the
asburys
had
returned
and
the
cottage
had
been
rented
by
a
family
who
were
anxious
to
take
possession
immediately
such
articles
of
furniture
as
were
no
longer
needed
had
been
sent
to
an
auction
room
and
she
sat
down
in
the
empty
dining
room
to
see
the
last
load
removed
she
bade
adieu
to
the
cottage
and
commenced
boarding
once
more
her
heart
was
heavy
but
her
eyes
were
undimmed
and
her
grave
composed
face
betokened
little
of
the
sorrow
which
oppressed
her
here
she
had
spent
five
years
in
peaceful
seclusion
here
she
had
toiled
and
earned
reputation
as
a
writer
and
here
many
hours
of
happiness
had
been
passed
among
her
flowers
the
place
was
very
dear
to
her
it
was
the
only
spot
on
the
face
of
the
wide
world
she
had
ever
felt
was
her
home
home
if
it
consists
of
but
a
sanded
floor
and
unplastered
walls
what
a
halo
is
shed
upon
its
humble
hearth
a
palatial
mansion
or
sequestered
cottage
among
wild
forests
were
alike
sanctified
by
the
name
home
the
heart
home
who
shall
compute
its
value
but
beulah
must
relinquish
her
retreat
and
find
refuge
in
the
home
of
others
would
this
content
her
was
she
to
be
always
homeless
true
she
was
to
reside
with
loved
and
tried
friends
yet
she
would
be
a
homeless
orphan
still
without
claims
upon
one
living
being
the
grave
had
closed
over
the
kind
matron
who
had
so
warmly
loved
her
and
she
was
without
ties
in
the
world
these
thoughts
passed
through
her
mind
as
she
saw
the
last
chair
deposited
on
a
furniture
cart
and
borne
away
charon
looked
up
at
her
mournfully
as
if
to
ask
are
we
homeless
where
shall
we
wander
she
stroked
his
head
and
went
into
the
flower
garden
to
gather
a
last
bouquet
from
plants
she
had
so
carefully
tended
an
early
frost
had
nipped
the
buds
but
the
chrysanthemums
were
in
all
their
glory
crimson
white
and
orange
she
broke
some
of
the
beautiful
clusters
and
with
a
long
lingering
look
turned
away
the
black
mourning
veil
was
thrown
back
from
a
pale
calm
face
and
as
she
walked
on
reflecting
upon
the
future
which
stretched
dimly
before
her
she
exclaimed
why
should
i
wish
it
otherwise
the
arms
of
a
merciful
god
will
shield
me
under
all
circumstances
my
life
was
not
given
for
a
mere
holiday
so
i
but
do
my
duty
faithfully
all
will
be
well
ah
truly
i
can
say
me
then
be
up
and
doing
with
a
heart
for
any
fate
still
achieving
still
pursuing
learn
to
labor
and
to
wait
yes
learn
to
labor
and
to
wait
the
heart
cries
out
fiercely
for
its
recompense
is
loath
to
wait
but
i
can
conquer
even
this
i
will
be
patient
and
hopeful
duty
is
its
own
recompense
asbury
spared
no
exertion
to
make
the
orphan
happy
in
her
house
she
treated
her
with
the
gentle
frankness
which
characterized
her
deportment
toward
her
daughters
and
to
identify
her
with
her
own
family
often
requested
her
to
assist
in
her
household
plans
she
thoroughly
understood
and
appreciated
beulah
nature
and
perfect
confidence
existed
between
them
it
was
no
sooner
known
that
beulah
was
an
inmate
of
the
house
than
many
persons
curious
to
see
one
of
whom
rumor
spoke
so
flatteringly
availed
themselves
of
the
circumstance
to
make
her
acquaintance
almost
unconsciously
she
soon
found
herself
the
center
of
a
circle
of
literary
people
whom
she
had
often
heard
of
but
had
never
known
previously
gradually
her
reserve
melted
away
and
her
fine
colloquial
powers
developed
themselves
but
she
wearied
of
the
visitors
wearied
even
of
the
themes
discussed
and
having
passed
her
life
in
seclusion
found
in
solitude
a
degree
of
enjoyment
which
society
could
not
confer
helen
had
married
a
planter
and
resided
at
some
distance
from
the
city
but
georgia
and
her
husband
remained
at
home
thus
imperceptibly
time
wore
on
eugene
often
came
and
spent
an
hour
with
beulah
and
still
more
frequently
cornelia
was
sent
to
while
away
an
evening
with
her
merry
prattle
very
steadily
eugene
advanced
in
his
profession
the
applause
of
the
world
cheered
him
on
and
an
enviable
reputation
was
his
at
last
grasping
ambition
lured
him
step
by
step
and
it
was
evident
that
he
aimed
at
a
seat
beside
reginald
lindsay
rejoiced
at
his
entire
reformation
and
proud
of
his
success
beulah
constantly
encouraged
his
aspirations
antoinette
was
as
gay
and
indifferent
as
ever
and
eugene
divided
his
heart
between
his
child
and
his
ambition
by
a
system
of
rigid
economy
in
the
disposal
of
her
time
beulah
not
only
attended
to
her
school
duties
her
music
and
her
books
but
found
leisure
after
writing
her
magazine
articles
to
spend
some
time
each
day
with
the
family
under
whose
roof
she
resided
asbury
health
was
rather
feeble
and
of
late
his
eyes
had
grown
so
dim
as
to
prevent
his
reading
or
writing
this
misfortune
was
to
a
great
extent
counterbalanced
by
his
wife
devoted
attention
and
often
beulah
shared
the
duties
of
the
library
one
bright
sunday
afternoon
she
walked
out
to
the
cemetery
which
she
visited
frequently
in
one
corner
of
a
small
lot
inclosed
by
a
costly
iron
railing
stood
a
beautiful
marble
monument
erected
by
grayson
over
lilly
grave
it
represented
two
angels
bearing
the
child
up
to
its
god
just
opposite
in
the
next
lot
was
a
splendid
mausoleum
of
the
finest
white
marble
bearing
in
gilt
letters
the
name
cornelia
graham
aged
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
temple
with
slender
fluted
columns
supporting
the
portico
and
on
the
ornate
capitals
was
inscribed
in
corresponding
gilt
characters
silentio
silentio
at
the
entrance
stood
two
winged
forms
crowned
with
wreaths
of
poppies
and
a
pair
of
beautiful
vases
held
withered
flowers
beulah
sat
on
the
marble
steps
before
her
stretched
aisles
of
tombstones
the
sunshine
sparkled
on
their
polished
surfaces
and
was
reflected
as
from
countless
mirrors
myrtle
and
laurel
trees
waved
gently
in
the
icy
north
wind
and
stately
solemn
cedars
kept
guard
in
every
inclosure
all
was
silent
and
still
save
those
funereal
evergreen
boughs
which
stirred
softly
as
if
fearful
of
disturbing
the
pale
sleepers
around
them
human
nature
shrinks
appalled
from
death
and
all
that
accompanies
it
but
in
the
deep
repose
the
sacred
hush
which
reigned
over
the
silent
city
there
was
for
beulah
something
inexpressibly
soothing
in
a
neighboring
lot
she
could
see
a
simple
white
slab
eugene
had
erected
over
the
remains
of
the
friend
of
their
childhood
her
labors
ended
the
matron
slept
near
the
forms
of
lilly
and
cornelia
here
winter
rains
fell
unheeded
and
here
the
balmy
breath
of
summer
brought
bright
blossoms
and
luxuriant
verdure
sang
cheerfully
in
the
sentinel
cedars
and
friends
wandered
slowly
over
the
shelled
walks
recalling
the
past
here
there
was
no
gloom
to
affright
the
timid
soul
all
was
serene
and
inviting
why
should
the
living
shrink
from
a
so
hallowed
and
peaceful
and
why
should
death
be
invested
with
fictitious
horrors
a
procession
entered
one
of
the
gates
and
wound
along
the
carriage
road
to
a
remote
corner
of
the
the
slow
measured
tread
of
the
horses
the
crush
of
wheels
on
the
rocky
track
and
the
smothered
sobs
of
the
mourners
all
came
in
subdued
tones
to
beulah
ears
then
the
train
disappeared
and
she
was
again
in
solitude
looking
up
her
eyes
rested
on
the
words
above
her
silentio
silentio
they
were
appropriate
indeed
upon
the
monument
of
her
who
had
gone
down
into
the
tomb
so
hopelessly
so
shudderingly
years
had
passed
since
the
only
child
had
been
laid
here
yet
the
hour
of
release
was
as
fresh
in
beulah
memory
as
though
she
had
seen
the
convulsed
features
but
yesterday
and
the
words
repeated
that
night
seemed
now
to
issue
from
the
marble
lips
of
the
statues
beside
her
for
here
we
have
no
continuing
city
but
seek
one
to
come
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
the
orphan
sat
pondering
the
awful
mystery
which
darkened
the
last
hour
of
the
young
sleeper
and
looking
back
over
her
own
life
during
the
season
when
she
was
without
god
and
without
hope
she
saw
that
only
unbelief
had
clothed
death
with
terror
once
she
stood
on
this
same
spot
and
with
trembling
horror
saw
the
coffin
lowered
had
death
touched
her
then
she
would
have
shrunk
appalled
from
the
summons
but
now
it
was
otherwise
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
saith
the
lord
he
that
believeth
in
me
though
he
were
dead
yet
shall
he
live
and
whosoever
liveth
and
believeth
in
me
shall
never
die
she
believed
and
while
a
beautiful
world
linked
her
to
life
and
duty
called
to
constant
and
cheerful
labor
death
lost
its
hideous
aspect
with
a
firm
faith
in
the
gospel
of
christ
she
felt
that
earth
with
all
its
loveliness
was
but
a
probationary
and
that
death
was
an
angel
of
god
summoning
the
laborers
to
their
harvest
home
she
had
often
asked
what
is
the
aim
and
end
of
life
one
set
of
philosophers
told
her
it
was
to
be
happy
another
exclaimed
it
was
to
learn
to
endure
with
fortitude
all
ills
but
neither
satisfied
her
one
promised
too
much
the
other
too
little
and
only
in
revelation
was
an
answer
found
yet
how
few
pause
to
ponder
its
significance
with
the
majority
life
is
the
all
the
springtime
the
holiday
and
death
the
hated
close
of
enjoyment
they
forget
that
not
enjoyment
and
not
sorrow
is
our
destined
end
or
way
but
to
act
that
each
find
us
further
than
the
path
of
christianity
is
neither
all
sunshine
nor
all
shadow
checkered
certainly
but
leading
to
a
final
abode
of
unimaginable
bliss
and
with
the
bible
to
guide
her
the
orphan
walked
fearlessly
on
discharging
her
duties
and
looking
unto
god
and
his
christ
to
aid
her
she
sat
on
the
steps
of
the
sepulcher
watching
the
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
gild
the
monumental
shafts
that
pointed
to
heaven
her
grave
face
might
have
told
the
scrutinizing
observer
of
years
of
grief
and
struggle
but
it
also
betokened
an
earnest
soul
calmly
trusting
the
wisdom
and
mercy
of
the
she
sighed
as
she
thought
of
the
gifted
but
unhappy
woman
who
slept
near
her
and
rising
walked
on
to
lilly
tomb
ten
years
had
rolled
their
waves
over
her
since
that
little
form
was
placed
here
she
looked
down
at
the
simple
epitaph
he
taketh
his
young
lambs
home
the
cherub
face
seemed
to
beam
upon
her
once
more
and
the
sweet
birdlike
tones
of
her
childish
voice
still
lingered
in
the
secret
cells
of
memory
she
extended
her
arms
as
if
to
clasp
the
form
borne
up
by
the
angels
and
said
tremulously
lilly
my
sister
my
darling
but
a
little
while
and
we
shall
meet
where
orphanage
is
unknown
doeth
all
things
well
ah
little
sleeper
i
can
wait
patiently
for
our
reunion
as
she
turned
her
steps
homeward
a
shadowy
smile
stole
over
her
features
and
the
lines
about
her
mouth
resumed
their
wonted
composure
beulah
father
has
been
asking
for
you
said
georgia
who
met
her
on
the
staircase
i
will
go
down
to
him
immediately
was
the
cheerful
answer
and
putting
away
her
bonnet
and
shawl
she
went
at
once
to
the
library
the
doctor
was
leaning
very
far
back
in
his
favorite
chair
and
she
saw
at
a
glance
he
had
fallen
asleep
asbury
sat
at
a
table
weighing
out
some
medicine
he
had
directed
sent
to
a
patient
she
looked
up
as
beulah
entered
smiled
and
said
in
an
undertone
my
liege
lord
is
indulging
in
a
nap
come
to
the
fire
dear
you
look
cold
she
left
the
room
with
the
medicine
and
beulah
stood
before
the
bright
wood
fire
and
watched
the
ruddy
light
flashing
grotesquely
over
the
pictures
on
the
wall
the
gas
had
not
yet
been
lighted
she
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
before
the
window
a
red
glow
still
lingered
in
the
west
and
one
by
one
the
stars
came
swiftly
out
she
took
up
a
book
she
had
been
reading
that
morning
but
it
was
too
dim
to
see
the
letters
and
she
contented
herself
with
looking
out
at
the
stars
brightening
as
the
night
deepened
so
should
it
be
with
faith
thought
she
and
yet
as
troubles
come
thick
and
fast
we
are
apt
to
despair
asbury
came
back
and
lighted
the
gas
but
beulah
was
too
much
absorbed
to
notice
it
the
doctor
waked
and
began
to
talk
about
the
severity
of
the
winter
further
north
and
the
suffering
it
produced
among
the
poor
presently
he
said
what
has
become
of
that
child
beulah
do
you
know
alice
yes
there
she
is
by
the
window
you
were
asleep
when
she
came
in
he
looked
round
and
called
to
her
what
are
you
thinking
about
beulah
you
look
as
cold
as
an
iceberg
come
to
the
fire
warm
hands
and
feet
will
aid
your
philosophizing
wonderfully
i
am
not
philosophizing
sir
she
replied
without
rising
i
will
wager
my
elegant
new
edition
of
coleridge
against
your
old
one
that
you
are
now
out
with
your
cogitations
you
incorrigible
dreamer
i
have
won
your
coleridge
i
was
only
thinking
of
that
talmudish
tradition
regarding
sandalphon
the
angel
of
prayer
what
of
him
why
that
he
stands
at
the
gate
of
heaven
listens
to
the
sounds
that
ascend
from
earth
and
gathering
all
the
prayers
and
entreaties
as
they
are
wafted
from
sorrowing
humanity
they
change
to
flowers
in
his
hands
and
the
perfume
is
borne
into
the
celestial
city
to
god
yesterday
i
read
longfellow
lines
on
this
legend
and
suppose
my
looking
up
at
the
stars
recalled
it
to
my
mind
but
georgia
told
me
you
asked
for
me
can
i
do
anything
for
you
sir
are
there
any
prescriptions
you
wish
written
off
she
came
and
stood
by
his
chair
no
thank
you
child
but
i
should
like
to
hear
more
of
that
book
you
were
reading
to
me
last
night
that
is
if
it
will
not
weary
you
my
child
certainly
not
here
it
is
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
ask
me
for
more
of
it
shall
i
begin
now
or
defer
it
till
after
tea
now
if
you
please
asbury
seated
herself
on
an
ottoman
at
her
husband
feet
and
threw
her
arm
up
over
his
knee
and
opening
butler
analogy
beulah
began
to
read
where
she
left
off
the
previous
day
in
the
chapter
on
a
future
life
with
his
hand
resting
on
his
wife
head
asbury
listened
attentively
at
the
conclusion
of
the
chapter
she
turned
to
the
dissertation
on
personal
identity
so
nearly
related
to
it
and
read
it
slowly
and
impressively
it
is
remarkably
clear
and
convincing
said
the
doctor
when
she
ceased
yes
his
argument
that
death
instead
of
being
an
abnormal
event
is
as
much
a
law
of
our
nature
as
birth
because
necessary
to
future
development
and
that
as
at
maturity
we
have
perfections
of
which
we
never
dreamed
in
infancy
so
death
may
put
us
in
possession
of
new
powers
by
releasing
us
from
the
chrysalis
state
is
one
which
has
peculiar
significance
to
my
mind
had
cornelia
graham
studied
it
she
would
never
have
been
tortured
by
the
thought
of
that
annihilation
which
she
fancied
awaited
her
from
childhood
this
question
of
identity
has
puzzled
me
but
it
seems
to
me
this
brief
treatise
of
butler
is
quite
satisfactory
it
should
be
a
in
all
educational
institutions
should
be
scattered
far
and
wide
through
the
land
here
the
solemn
tones
of
the
church
bells
told
that
the
hour
of
evening
service
drew
near
the
doctor
started
and
said
abruptly
bless
me
alice
are
we
to
have
no
tea
yes
the
tea
bell
rang
some
minutes
ago
but
beulah
had
not
quite
finished
her
chapter
and
i
would
not
interrupt
as
they
walked
on
to
the
dining
room
he
said
you
two
are
going
to
church
i
suppose
no
i
shall
remain
with
you
answered
his
wife
gently
you
need
not
my
dear
i
will
go
with
you
if
you
prefer
it
beulah
did
not
look
up
but
she
knew
that
wife
was
unspeakably
happy
and
understood
why
during
tea
she
was
so
quiet
so
unwontedly
silent
chapter
xxxix
i
wish
hartwell
would
come
home
and
attend
to
his
business
muttered
asbury
some
weeks
later
and
as
he
spoke
he
threw
his
feet
impatiently
over
the
fender
of
the
grate
looking
discontented
enough
he
will
come
sir
he
will
come
answered
beulah
who
sat
near
him
how
do
you
know
that
so
well
child
why
do
you
suppose
he
will
come
asked
the
doctor
knitting
his
bushy
gray
eyebrows
perhaps
because
i
wish
it
so
very
much
and
hope
and
faith
are
nearly
allied
you
know
and
perhaps
more
than
this
because
i
have
prayed
so
long
for
his
return
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded
looking
quietly
into
the
glowing
grate
the
old
man
watched
her
a
moment
as
the
firelight
glared
over
her
grave
composed
face
and
tears
came
suddenly
into
his
eyes
when
harry
hartwell
died
about
eighteen
months
since
he
left
his
share
of
the
estate
to
guy
it
is
one
of
the
finest
plantations
in
the
state
and
for
the
last
three
years
the
crops
have
been
remarkably
good
the
cotton
has
been
sold
regularly
and
the
bulk
of
the
money
is
still
in
the
hands
of
the
factor
yesterday
i
happened
to
pass
the
old
house
and
rode
in
to
see
how
things
looked
positively
child
you
would
scarcely
recognize
the
place
you
know
the
farleys
only
occupied
it
a
few
months
since
that
time
it
has
been
rented
just
now
it
is
vacant
and
such
a
tenement
i
have
not
seen
for
many
days
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
here
a
servant
entered
to
inform
the
doctor
that
he
was
wanted
immediately
to
see
one
of
his
patients
he
kicked
off
his
slippers
and
got
up
grumbling
a
plague
on
guy
peregrinating
proclivities
i
am
getting
too
old
to
jump
up
every
three
seconds
to
keep
somebody
baby
from
jerking
itself
into
a
spasm
or
suffocating
with
the
croup
hartwell
ought
to
be
here
to
take
all
this
practice
off
my
hands
he
put
on
his
overcoat
and
went
out
beulah
sat
quite
still
for
some
minutes
after
his
departure
then
glancing
at
the
clock
she
started
up
suddenly
where
are
you
going
my
dear
said
asbury
looking
up
from
a
letter
she
was
writing
to
helen
to
walk
but
leonard
is
coming
here
this
afternoon
to
see
you
he
requested
me
to
tell
you
so
i
do
want
to
see
him
but
my
dear
he
has
already
called
several
times
recently
without
seeing
you
and
if
he
had
any
penetration
he
might
perceive
that
the
avoidance
was
intended
i
am
tired
of
his
frequent
visits
and
endless
harangues
and
he
might
see
it
if
he
chose
she
looked
rather
impatient
asbury
had
sealed
her
letter
and
approaching
the
rug
where
beulah
stood
she
laid
her
soft
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
said
gently
my
dear
child
do
not
think
me
officious
or
prompted
by
mere
idle
curiosity
if
i
ask
do
you
intend
to
reject
him
why
i
have
rejected
him
once
and
still
he
forces
his
society
upon
me
as
to
staying
at
home
to
see
him
i
wo
do
it
asbury
seemed
surprised
and
said
smilingly
upon
my
word
beulah
you
seem
fastidious
indeed
what
possible
objection
could
you
find
to
hugh
leonard
why
my
dear
he
is
the
best
match
in
the
city
i
would
about
as
soon
think
of
marrying
the
doctor
armchair
there
beulah
went
to
her
own
room
and
put
on
her
bonnet
and
cloak
charon
very
rarely
attended
her
in
her
rambles
he
had
grown
old
and
was
easily
fatigued
but
this
afternoon
she
called
to
him
and
they
set
out
it
was
a
mild
sunny
evening
for
winter
and
she
took
the
street
leading
to
her
guardian
old
residence
a
quick
walk
soon
brought
her
into
the
suburbs
and
ere
long
she
stood
before
the
entrance
the
great
central
gate
was
chained
but
the
little
side
gate
was
completely
broken
from
its
hinges
and
lay
on
the
ground
alas
this
was
but
the
beginning
as
she
entered
she
saw
with
dismay
that
the
yard
was
full
of
stray
cattle
cows
sheep
goats
browsed
about
undisturbed
among
the
shrubbery
which
her
guardian
had
tended
so
carefully
she
had
not
been
here
since
he
sold
it
but
even
charon
saw
that
something
was
strangely
amiss
he
bounded
off
and
soon
cleared
the
inclosure
of
the
herd
which
had
become
accustomed
to
grazing
here
beulah
walked
slowly
up
the
avenue
the
aged
cedars
whispered
hoarsely
above
her
as
she
passed
and
the
towering
poplars
whose
ceaseless
silvery
rustle
had
an
indescribable
charm
for
her
in
summers
past
now
tossed
their
bare
boughs
toward
her
in
mute
complaining
of
the
desolation
which
surrounded
them
the
reckless
indifference
of
tenants
has
deservedly
grown
into
a
proverb
and
here
beulah
beheld
an
exemplification
of
its
truth
of
all
the
choice
shrubbery
which
it
had
been
the
labor
of
years
to
collect
and
foster
not
a
particle
remained
hoses
creepers
bulbs
all
were
destroyed
and
only
the
trees
and
hedges
were
spared
the
very
outline
of
the
beds
was
effaced
in
many
places
and
walking
round
the
paved
circle
in
front
of
the
door
she
paused
abruptly
at
the
desolation
which
greeted
her
here
was
the
marble
basin
of
the
fountain
half
filled
with
rubbish
as
though
it
had
been
converted
into
a
receptacle
for
trash
and
over
the
whole
front
of
the
house
the
dark
glossy
leaves
of
the
creeping
ivy
clung
in
thick
masses
she
looked
around
on
all
sides
but
only
ruin
and
neglect
confronted
her
she
remembered
the
last
time
she
came
here
and
recalled
the
beautiful
sunday
morning
when
she
saw
her
guardian
standing
by
the
fountain
feeding
his
pigeons
ah
how
sadly
changed
she
burst
into
tears
and
sat
down
on
the
steps
charon
ran
about
the
yard
for
some
time
then
came
back
looked
up
at
the
somber
house
howled
and
lay
down
at
her
feet
where
was
the
old
master
wandering
among
eastern
pagodas
while
his
home
became
a
retreat
for
owls
he
has
forgotten
us
charon
he
has
forgotten
his
two
best
and
i
who
love
him
so
well
oh
charon
he
has
forgotten
us
cried
she
almost
despairingly
charon
gave
a
melancholy
groan
of
assent
and
nestled
closer
to
her
five
years
had
gone
since
he
left
his
native
land
and
for
once
her
faith
was
faint
and
wavering
but
after
some
moments
she
looked
up
at
the
calm
sky
arching
above
her
and
wiping
away
her
tears
added
resignedly
but
he
will
come
god
will
bring
him
home
when
he
sees
fit
i
can
wait
i
can
wait
charon
great
gleaming
black
eyes
met
hers
wistfully
he
seemed
dubious
of
his
master
return
beulah
rose
and
he
obeyed
the
signal
come
charon
it
is
getting
late
but
we
will
come
back
some
day
and
live
here
it
was
dusk
when
she
entered
the
library
and
found
asbury
discussing
the
political
questions
of
the
day
with
her
husband
she
had
just
finished
reading
aloud
one
of
reginald
congressional
speeches
and
advocated
it
warmly
while
the
doctor
reprobated
some
portion
of
his
course
you
have
had
a
long
walk
said
asbury
looking
up
as
the
orphan
entered
and
look
for
the
universe
as
if
you
had
been
cried
the
doctor
wiping
his
spectacles
i
would
rather
meet
an
army
of
ghosts
than
see
what
i
have
seen
answered
beulah
good
heavens
in
the
name
of
wonder
what
have
you
seen
child
a
rattlesnake
or
a
he
put
his
broad
palms
on
his
knees
and
looked
mockingly
curious
and
startled
i
have
been
out
to
see
the
old
place
sir
found
the
gate
broken
down
the
front
yard
full
of
cows
and
everything
going
to
destruction
except
the
trees
and
hedges
sir
it
makes
me
feel
very
sad
i
ca
bear
to
have
things
go
on
this
way
any
longer
it
must
be
rectified
bless
my
soul
that
is
easier
said
than
done
the
place
is
a
perfect
there
is
no
denying
that
but
it
is
no
business
of
ours
if
farley
or
his
agent
suffers
the
property
to
go
to
ruin
it
is
his
loss
but
i
love
the
place
i
want
to
save
it
wo
you
buy
it
dr
asbury
wo
i
buy
it
why
what
on
earth
do
you
suppose
i
should
do
with
it
i
do
want
to
live
in
it
and
as
for
any
more
investments
in
real
estate
why
just
excuse
me
if
you
please
insurance
and
repairs
eat
up
all
the
profits
and
i
am
plagued
to
death
with
petitions
in
the
bargain
then
i
must
buy
it
myself
said
beulah
resolutely
in
the
name
of
common
sense
tell
me
what
you
will
do
with
it
i
do
know
yet
keep
it
i
suppose
until
he
comes
home
again
how
much
do
you
suppose
the
farleys
ask
for
it
i
really
can
not
conjecture
but
child
you
must
not
think
of
this
i
will
see
the
agent
about
it
and
perhaps
i
may
purchase
it
to
oblige
you
i
will
not
hear
of
your
buying
it
guy
certainly
can
not
contemplate
heathenating
much
longer
there
is
that
eternal
bell
again
somebody
that
believes
i
am
constructed
of
wire
and
i
dare
say
he
leaned
back
and
watched
the
door
very
uneasily
a
servant
looked
in
leonard
to
see
miss
beulah
thank
heaven
it
is
nobody
to
see
me
the
doctor
settled
himself
comfortably
and
laughed
at
the
perturbed
expression
of
countenance
ask
him
to
excuse
me
this
evening
said
she
without
rising
nay
my
dear
he
was
here
this
afternoon
and
you
had
gone
to
walk
it
would
be
rude
not
to
see
him
go
into
the
parlor
do
my
dear
perhaps
he
will
not
detain
you
long
remonstrated
asbury
beulah
said
nothing
she
set
her
lips
firmly
rose
and
went
to
the
parlor
i
will
wager
my
head
he
wo
stay
fifteen
minutes
after
he
gets
a
glimpse
of
her
face
hugh
ought
to
have
sense
enough
to
see
that
she
does
not
fancy
him
said
the
doctor
laughing
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
the
man
she
would
fancy
answered
his
wife
knitting
away
busily
on
a
purse
for
some
sewing
society
oh
alice
do
you
wonder
she
does
not
like
hugh
leonard
he
is
a
as
far
as
position
and
money
and
a
certain
sort
of
talent
and
is
very
clever
and
upright
i
know
but
he
does
not
suit
beulah
if
she
would
not
marry
reginald
of
course
she
marry
hugh
jangle
went
the
door
bell
once
more
and
this
time
the
doctor
was
forced
to
leave
his
chair
and
slippers
the
winter
had
been
very
gay
and
without
doubt
the
belle
of
the
season
was
claudia
grayson
she
had
grown
up
a
brilliant
imperious
beauty
petted
most
injudiciously
by
and
grayson
the
best
elements
of
her
character
instead
of
being
fostered
and
developed
were
smothered
beneath
vanity
and
arrogance
and
soon
selfishness
became
the
dominant
characteristic
to
those
whom
she
considered
her
inferiors
she
was
supercilious
and
overbearing
while
even
in
her
adopted
home
she
tyrannized
over
both
servants
and
parents
flattered
and
sought
after
in
society
she
was
never
happy
unless
the
center
of
a
gay
circle
ere
long
she
discovered
the
heartlessness
of
her
admirers
learned
the
malice
and
envy
of
the
very
people
she
visited
most
intimately
and
once
acquainted
with
their
natures
and
habits
she
found
her
greatest
amusement
in
ridiculing
those
who
did
precisely
the
same
thing
the
moment
she
left
them
beulah
had
never
been
able
to
conquer
her
feelings
sufficiently
to
enter
grayson
house
but
she
had
met
claudia
several
times
the
latter
when
accompanied
by
any
of
her
fashionable
acquaintances
always
shrank
from
recognizing
her
and
finally
thinking
any
allusion
to
former
years
and
the
asylum
a
personal
insult
she
passed
her
without
even
a
bow
the
first
time
this
occurred
beulah
was
deeply
wounded
she
had
loved
claudia
very
warmly
and
her
superciliousness
was
hard
to
bear
but
the
slight
was
repeated
several
times
and
she
learned
to
pity
her
weakness
most
sincerely
ah
thought
she
how
much
better
it
was
that
lilly
should
die
than
live
to
grow
up
a
heartless
flirt
like
claudy
much
better
little
sister
much
better
it
was
the
morning
after
her
walk
to
the
old
home
of
her
guardian
that
asbury
threw
down
the
paper
on
the
breakfast
table
with
an
exclamation
of
horror
what
is
the
matter
george
cried
his
wife
while
beulah
grew
deadly
pale
and
clutched
the
paper
her
mind
like
hinda
still
singling
one
from
all
mankind
matter
why
poor
grayson
has
committed
suicide
shot
himself
last
night
poor
wretch
he
has
been
speculating
too
freely
and
lost
every
cent
and
worse
than
that
used
money
to
do
it
that
was
not
his
he
made
desperate
throws
and
lost
all
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
when
his
operations
were
discovered
he
shot
himself
leaving
his
family
utterly
destitute
i
heard
yesterday
that
they
would
not
have
a
cent
but
never
dreamed
of
his
being
so
weak
as
to
kill
himself
miserable
mistake
what
will
become
of
grayson
and
claudia
asked
beulah
sorrowfully
i
do
know
really
grayson
has
a
brother
living
somewhere
up
the
country
i
suppose
he
will
offer
them
a
home
such
as
he
has
i
pity
her
she
is
a
weak
creature
weak
mind
and
body
and
this
reverse
will
come
very
near
killing
her
for
some
days
nothing
was
discussed
but
the
grayson
tragedy
it
was
well
the
unhappy
man
could
not
listen
to
the
fierce
maledictions
of
disappointed
creditors
and
the
slanders
which
were
now
heaped
upon
his
name
whatever
his
motives
might
have
been
the
world
called
his
offenses
by
the
darkest
names
and
angry
creditors
vowed
every
knife
fork
and
spoon
should
come
under
the
hammer
the
elegant
house
was
sold
the
furniture
with
it
and
grayson
and
claudia
removed
temporarily
to
a
boarding
house
not
one
of
their
fashionable
intimates
approached
them
no
not
one
when
claudia
went
one
day
to
her
mantuamaker
to
have
her
mourning
fitted
she
met
a
couple
of
ladies
who
had
formerly
been
constant
visitors
at
the
house
and
regular
attendants
at
her
parties
unsuspectingly
she
hastened
to
meet
them
but
to
her
astonishment
instead
of
greeting
her
in
their
usual
fawning
manner
they
received
her
with
a
very
cold
bow
just
touched
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
gathering
up
their
robes
swept
majestically
from
the
room
rage
and
mortification
forced
the
tears
into
her
eyes
asbury
had
never
admired
grayson
character
she
visited
her
formally
about
twice
a
year
but
now
in
this
misfortune
she
alone
called
to
see
her
when
claudia
returned
from
the
mantuamaker
she
found
asbury
with
her
mother
and
received
from
her
hand
a
kind
friendly
note
from
the
girl
she
had
so
grossly
insulted
beulah
was
no
flatterer
she
wrote
candidly
and
plainly
said
she
would
have
called
at
once
had
she
supposed
her
company
would
be
acceptable
she
would
gladly
come
and
see
claudia
whenever
she
desired
to
see
her
and
hoped
that
the
memory
of
other
years
would
teach
her
the
sincerity
of
her
friendship
claudia
wept
bitterly
as
she
read
it
and
vainly
regretted
the
superciliousness
which
had
alienated
one
she
knew
to
be
noble
and
trustworthy
she
was
naturally
an
impulsive
creature
and
without
a
hesitation
dashed
off
an
answer
all
blurred
with
tears
begging
beulah
to
overlook
her
foolishness
and
come
to
see
her
accordingly
after
school
beulah
went
to
the
house
where
they
were
boarding
claudia
met
her
rather
awkwardly
but
beulah
kissed
her
as
if
nothing
had
ever
occurred
to
mar
their
intercourse
and
after
some
desultory
conversation
asked
her
what
they
expected
to
do
heaven
only
knows
starve
i
suppose
she
spoke
gloomily
and
folded
her
soft
white
hands
over
each
other
as
if
the
idea
of
work
was
something
altogether
foreign
to
her
mind
but
claudia
i
reckon
you
hardly
expect
to
starve
answered
beulah
who
could
not
forbear
smiling
dear
knows
what
is
to
become
of
us
i
am
sure
i
do
mamma
has
a
brother
living
in
some
place
up
the
country
but
he
does
not
like
me
thinks
some
of
his
own
children
ought
to
have
been
adopted
in
my
place
heaven
knows
i
have
made
nothing
by
the
operation
but
a
great
disappointment
he
need
not
be
uneasy
about
the
amount
i
am
to
get
but
you
see
they
do
want
me
having
an
old
spite
at
me
and
mamma
dislikes
to
ask
them
to
take
me
besides
i
would
almost
as
soon
be
buried
at
once
as
go
to
that
farm
or
plantation
or
whatever
it
is
they
have
written
to
mamma
to
come
and
she
does
not
know
what
to
do
you
are
a
good
musician
are
you
not
no
not
particularly
i
never
could
endure
to
practice
do
you
draw
and
paint
finely
i
have
heard
that
you
did
yes
but
what
good
will
it
do
me
now
i
should
like
to
know
she
twirled
her
little
plump
jeweled
fingers
indolently
it
might
do
you
a
great
deal
of
good
if
you
chose
you
might
support
yourself
by
giving
lessons
said
beulah
decisively
she
drew
up
her
shoulders
frowned
and
pouted
without
making
any
answer
claudy
you
do
not
wish
to
be
dependent
on
a
man
who
dislikes
you
not
if
i
can
help
myself
and
you
certainly
do
not
wish
to
be
the
means
of
preventing
grayson
from
having
a
comfortable
home
with
her
brother
claudia
burst
into
tears
she
did
not
love
her
mother
did
not
even
respect
her
she
was
so
very
weak
and
childish
yet
the
young
orphan
felt
very
desolate
and
knew
not
what
to
do
beulah
took
her
hand
and
said
kindly
if
you
are
willing
to
help
yourself
dear
claudy
i
will
gladly
do
all
i
can
to
assist
you
i
think
i
can
secure
you
a
situation
as
teacher
of
drawing
and
until
you
can
make
something
at
it
i
will
pay
your
board
and
you
shall
stay
with
me
if
you
like
you
can
think
about
it
and
let
me
know
as
soon
as
you
decide
claudia
thanked
her
cordially
and
returning
home
beulah
immediately
imparted
the
plan
to
her
friends
they
thought
it
would
scarcely
succeed
claudia
had
been
so
petted
and
spoiled
beulah
sat
gazing
into
the
fire
for
a
while
then
looking
at
the
doctor
said
abruptly
there
is
that
graham
money
sir
doing
nobody
any
good
that
is
just
what
i
have
been
telling
you
for
the
last
six
years
i
have
invested
it
carefully
until
it
has
almost
doubled
itself
it
would
make
them
very
comfortable
continued
she
thoughtfully
make
them
very
comfortable
repeated
the
doctor
throwing
his
cigar
into
the
grate
and
turning
suddenly
toward
her
yes
claudia
and
mrs
grayson
beulah
benton
are
you
going
insane
i
should
like
to
know
here
you
are
working
hard
every
day
of
your
life
and
do
you
suppose
i
shall
suffer
you
to
give
that
legacy
nearly
nine
thousand
dollars
to
support
two
fashionables
in
idleness
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
piece
of
business
since
the
world
began
i
will
not
consent
to
it
i
tell
you
now
the
money
shall
not
leave
my
hands
for
any
such
purpose
i
do
want
it
myself
i
never
shall
touch
a
dollar
of
it
for
my
own
use
said
she
resolutely
all
very
fine
now
but
wait
till
you
get
superannuated
or
such
a
cripple
with
rheumatism
that
you
ca
hobble
to
that
schoolhouse
which
you
seem
to
love
better
than
your
own
soul
wait
till
then
i
say
and
see
whether
some
of
this
money
will
not
be
very
acceptable
that
time
will
never
come
sir
never
answered
beulah
laughing
beulah
benton
you
are
a
simpleton
said
he
looking
affectionately
at
her
from
beneath
his
shaggy
brows
i
want
that
money
sir
you
shall
not
have
one
cent
of
it
the
idea
of
your
playing
lady
bountiful
to
the
graysons
pshaw
not
a
picayune
shall
you
have
oh
sir
it
would
make
me
so
very
happy
to
aid
them
you
can
not
conceive
how
much
pleasure
it
would
afford
me
look
here
child
all
that
sort
of
angelic
disinterestedness
sounds
very
well
done
up
in
a
novel
but
the
reality
is
quite
another
matter
grayson
treated
you
like
a
brute
and
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
you
will
have
any
extraordinary
degree
of
affection
for
her
human
nature
is
spiteful
and
unforgiving
and
as
for
your
piling
coals
of
fire
on
her
head
to
the
amount
of
nine
thousand
dollars
that
is
being
entirely
too
magnanimous
i
want
to
make
grayson
amends
sir
once
when
i
was
maddened
by
sorrow
and
pain
i
said
something
which
i
always
repented
bitterly
as
beulah
spoke
a
cloud
swept
across
her
face
what
was
it
child
what
did
you
say
i
cursed
her
besought
god
to
punish
her
severely
for
her
unkindness
to
me
i
hardly
knew
what
i
was
saying
but
even
then
it
shocked
me
and
i
prayed
god
to
forgive
my
passion
i
shudder
when
i
remember
it
i
have
forgiven
her
heartlessness
long
ago
and
now
sir
i
want
you
to
give
me
that
money
if
it
is
mine
at
all
it
is
mine
to
employ
as
i
choose
cornelia
did
not
leave
the
legacy
to
the
graysons
were
she
living
she
would
commend
the
use
i
am
about
to
make
of
it
will
you
give
me
five
thousand
dollars
of
it
oh
beulah
you
are
a
queer
compound
a
strange
being
will
you
give
me
five
thousand
dollars
of
that
money
tomorrow
persisted
beulah
looking
steadily
at
him
yes
child
if
you
will
have
it
so
his
voice
trembled
and
he
looked
at
the
orphan
with
moist
eyes
asbury
had
taken
no
part
in
the
conversation
but
her
earnest
face
attested
her
interest
passing
her
arm
around
beulah
waist
she
hastily
kissed
her
brow
and
only
said
god
bless
you
my
dear
noble
beulah
i
do
not
see
that
i
am
at
all
magnanimous
in
giving
away
other
people
money
if
i
had
earned
it
by
hard
labor
and
then
given
it
to
claudy
there
would
have
been
some
more
show
of
generosity
here
come
georgia
and
her
husband
you
do
not
need
me
to
read
this
evening
and
i
have
work
to
do
she
extricated
herself
from
asbury
clasping
arm
and
retired
to
her
own
room
the
following
day
claudia
came
to
say
that
as
she
knew
not
what
else
to
do
she
would
gladly
accept
the
position
mentioned
as
teacher
of
drawing
and
painting
grayson
brother
had
come
to
take
her
home
but
she
was
unwilling
to
be
separated
from
claudia
beulah
no
longer
hesitated
and
the
sum
of
five
thousand
dollars
seemed
to
poor
claudia
a
fortune
indeed
she
could
not
understand
how
the
girl
whom
she
and
her
mother
had
insulted
could
possibly
have
the
means
of
making
them
so
comparatively
comfortable
beulah
briefly
explained
the
circumstances
which
had
enabled
her
to
assist
them
the
bulk
of
the
money
remained
in
asbury
hands
and
claudia
was
to
apply
to
him
whenever
she
needed
it
she
and
her
mamma
found
a
cheaper
boarding
house
and
claudia
duties
began
at
once
grayson
was
overwhelmed
with
shame
when
the
particulars
were
made
known
to
her
and
tears
of
bitter
mortification
could
not
obliterate
the
memory
of
the
hour
when
she
cruelly
denied
the
prayer
of
the
poor
orphan
to
whom
she
now
owed
the
shelter
above
her
head
beulah
did
not
see
her
for
many
weeks
subsequent
she
knew
how
painful
such
a
meeting
would
be
to
the
humbled
woman
and
while
she
constantly
cheered
and
encouraged
claudia
in
her
work
she
studiously
avoided
grayson
presence
thus
the
winter
passed
and
once
more
the
glories
of
a
southern
spring
were
scattered
over
the
land
to
the
asburys
beulah
was
warmly
attached
and
her
residence
with
them
was
as
pleasant
as
any
home
could
possibly
have
been
which
was
not
her
own
they
were
all
that
friends
could
be
to
an
orphan
still
she
regretted
her
little
cottage
and
missed
the
she
had
prized
so
highly
true
she
had
constant
access
to
the
greenhouse
and
was
rarely
without
her
bouquet
of
choice
flowers
but
these
could
not
compensate
her
for
the
loss
of
her
own
little
garden
she
struggled
bravely
with
discontent
tried
to
look
only
on
the
sunshine
in
her
path
and
to
be
always
cheerful
in
this
she
partially
succeeded
no
matter
how
lonely
and
sad
she
felt
she
hid
it
carefully
and
the
evenings
in
the
library
were
never
marred
by
words
of
repining
or
looks
of
sorrow
to
the
close
observer
there
were
traces
of
grief
in
her
countenance
and
sometimes
when
she
sat
sewing
while
asbury
read
aloud
it
was
easy
to
see
that
her
thoughts
had
wandered
far
from
that
little
room
time
had
changed
her
singularly
since
the
old
asylum
days
she
was
now
a
finely
formed
remarkably
graceful
woman
with
a
complexion
of
dazzling
transparency
she
was
always
pale
but
the
blue
veins
might
be
traced
anywhere
on
her
brow
and
temples
and
the
dark
gray
eyes
with
their
long
jetty
curling
lashes
possessed
an
indescribable
charm
even
for
strangers
she
had
been
an
ugly
child
but
certainly
she
was
a
if
not
handsome
woman
to
all
but
the
family
with
whom
she
resided
she
was
rather
reserved
and
while
the
world
admired
and
eulogized
her
talents
as
a
writer
she
felt
that
except
eugene
she
had
no
friends
beyond
the
threshold
of
the
house
she
lived
in
as
weeks
and
months
elapsed
and
no
news
of
her
wandering
guardian
came
her
hope
began
to
pale
for
weary
years
it
had
burned
brightly
but
constant
disappointment
was
pressing
heavily
on
her
heart
and
crushing
out
the
holy
spark
the
heartstrings
will
bear
rude
shocks
and
sudden
rough
handling
but
the
gradual
tightening
the
unremitted
tension
of
long
tediously
rolling
years
will
in
time
accomplish
what
fierce
assaults
can
not
continually
she
prayed
for
his
return
but
despite
her
efforts
her
faith
grew
fainter
as
each
month
crept
by
and
her
smile
became
more
constrained
and
joyless
she
never
spoke
of
her
anxiety
never
alluded
to
him
but
pressed
her
hands
over
her
aching
heart
and
did
her
work
silently
nay
cheerfully
chapter
xl
the
day
was
dull
misty
and
gusty
all
the
morning
there
had
been
a
driving
southeasterly
rain
but
toward
noon
there
was
a
lull
the
afternoon
was
heavy
and
threatening
while
armies
of
dense
clouds
drifted
before
the
wind
asbury
had
not
yet
returned
from
his
round
of
evening
visits
asbury
had
gone
to
the
asylum
to
see
a
sick
child
and
georgia
was
dining
with
her
husband
mother
beulah
came
home
from
school
more
than
usually
fatigued
one
of
the
assistant
teachers
was
indisposed
and
she
had
done
double
work
to
relieve
her
she
sat
before
her
desk
writing
industriously
on
an
article
she
had
promised
to
complete
before
the
end
of
the
week
her
head
ached
the
lines
grew
dim
and
she
laid
aside
her
manuscript
and
leaned
her
face
on
her
palms
the
beautiful
lashes
lay
against
her
brow
for
the
eyes
were
raised
to
the
portrait
above
her
desk
and
she
gazed
up
at
the
faultless
features
with
an
expression
of
sad
hopelessness
years
had
not
filled
the
void
in
her
heart
with
other
treasures
at
this
hour
it
ached
with
its
own
desolation
and
extending
her
arms
imploringly
toward
the
picture
she
exclaimed
sorrowfully
o
my
god
how
long
must
i
wait
oh
how
long
she
opened
the
desk
and
taking
out
a
key
left
her
room
and
slowly
ascended
to
the
third
story
charon
crept
up
the
steps
after
her
she
unlocked
the
apartment
which
asbury
had
given
into
her
charge
some
time
before
and
raising
one
of
the
windows
looped
back
the
heavy
blue
curtains
which
gave
a
somber
hue
to
all
within
from
this
elevated
position
she
could
see
the
stormy
sullen
waters
of
the
bay
breaking
against
the
wharves
and
hear
their
hoarse
muttering
as
they
rocked
themselves
to
rest
after
the
scourging
of
the
tempest
gray
clouds
hung
low
and
scudded
northward
everything
looked
dull
and
gloomy
she
turned
from
the
window
and
glanced
around
the
room
it
was
at
all
times
a
painful
pleasure
to
come
here
and
now
particularly
the
interior
impressed
her
sadly
here
were
the
paintings
and
statues
she
had
long
been
so
familiar
with
and
here
too
the
melodeon
which
at
rare
intervals
she
opened
the
house
was
very
quiet
not
a
sound
came
up
from
below
she
raised
the
lid
of
the
instrument
and
played
a
plaintive
prelude
echoes
seven
or
eight
years
old
suddenly
fell
on
her
ears
she
had
not
heard
one
note
of
this
air
since
she
left
hartwell
roof
it
was
a
favorite
song
of
his
a
german
hymn
he
had
taught
her
and
now
after
seven
years
she
sang
it
it
was
a
melancholy
air
and
as
her
trembling
voice
rolled
through
the
house
she
seemed
to
live
the
old
days
over
again
but
the
words
died
away
on
her
lips
she
had
overestimated
her
strength
she
could
not
sing
it
the
marble
images
around
her
like
ghosts
of
the
past
looked
mutely
down
at
her
grief
she
could
not
weep
her
eyes
were
dry
and
there
was
an
intolerable
weight
on
her
heart
just
before
her
stood
the
niobe
rigid
and
woeful
she
put
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
drooped
her
face
on
the
melodeon
gloom
and
despair
crouched
at
her
side
their
gaunt
hands
tugging
at
the
anchor
of
hope
the
wind
rose
and
howled
round
the
corners
of
the
house
how
fierce
it
might
be
on
trackless
seas
driving
lonely
barks
down
to
ruin
and
strewing
the
main
with
ghastly
upturned
faces
she
shuddered
and
groaned
it
was
a
dark
hour
of
trial
and
she
struggled
desperately
with
the
phantoms
that
clustered
about
her
then
there
came
other
sounds
charon
shrill
frantic
bark
and
whine
of
delight
for
years
she
had
not
heard
that
peculiar
bark
and
started
up
in
wonder
on
the
threshold
stood
a
tall
form
with
a
straw
hat
drawn
down
over
the
features
but
charon
paws
were
on
the
shoulders
and
his
whine
of
delight
ceased
not
he
fell
down
at
his
master
feet
and
caressed
them
beulah
looked
an
instant
and
sprang
into
the
doorway
holding
out
her
arms
with
a
wild
joyful
cry
come
at
last
oh
thank
god
come
at
last
her
face
was
radiant
her
eyes
burned
her
glowing
lips
parted
leaning
against
the
door
with
his
arms
crossed
over
his
broad
chest
hartwell
stood
silently
regarding
her
she
came
close
to
him
and
her
extended
arms
trembled
still
he
did
not
move
did
not
speak
oh
i
knew
you
would
come
and
thank
god
now
you
are
here
come
home
at
last
she
looked
up
at
him
so
eagerly
but
he
said
nothing
she
stood
an
instant
irresolute
then
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
laid
her
head
on
his
bosom
clinging
closely
to
him
he
did
not
return
the
embrace
but
looked
down
at
the
beaming
face
and
sighed
then
he
put
his
hand
softly
on
her
head
and
smoothed
the
rippling
hair
a
brilliant
smile
broke
over
her
features
as
she
felt
the
remembered
touch
of
his
fingers
on
her
forehead
and
she
repeated
in
the
low
tones
of
deep
gladness
i
knew
you
would
come
oh
sir
i
knew
you
would
come
back
to
me
how
did
you
know
it
child
he
said
for
the
first
time
her
heart
leaped
wildly
at
the
sound
of
the
loved
voice
she
had
so
longed
to
hear
and
she
answered
tremblingly
because
for
weary
years
i
have
prayed
for
your
return
oh
only
god
knows
how
fervently
i
prayed
and
he
has
heard
me
she
felt
his
strong
frame
quiver
he
folded
his
arms
about
her
clasped
her
to
his
heart
with
a
force
that
almost
suffocated
her
and
bending
his
head
kissed
her
passionately
suddenly
his
arms
relaxed
their
clasp
holding
her
off
he
looked
at
her
keenly
and
said
beulah
benton
do
you
belong
to
the
tyrant
ambition
or
do
you
belong
to
that
tyrant
guy
hartwell
quick
child
decide
i
have
decided
said
she
her
cheeks
burned
her
lashes
drooped
well
well
if
i
am
to
have
a
tyrant
i
believe
i
prefer
belonging
to
you
he
frowned
she
smiled
and
looked
up
at
him
beulah
i
do
want
a
grateful
wife
do
you
understand
me
yes
sir
just
then
his
eyes
rested
on
the
portrait
of
creola
which
hung
opposite
he
drew
back
a
step
and
she
saw
the
blood
leave
his
lips
as
he
gazed
upon
it
lifting
his
hand
he
said
sternly
ah
what
pale
specters
that
face
calls
up
from
the
grim
gray
ruins
of
memory
doubtless
you
know
my
miserable
history
i
married
her
thinking
i
had
won
her
love
she
soon
undeceived
me
we
separated
i
once
asked
you
to
be
my
wife
and
you
told
me
you
would
rather
die
child
years
have
not
dealt
lightly
with
me
since
then
i
am
no
longer
a
young
man
look
here
he
threw
off
his
hat
and
passing
his
fingers
through
his
curling
hair
she
saw
here
and
there
streaks
of
silver
he
watched
her
as
she
noted
it
she
saw
too
how
haggard
he
looked
now
that
the
light
fell
full
on
his
pale
face
the
splendid
dark
eyes
were
unaltered
and
as
they
looked
down
into
hers
tears
gathered
on
her
lashes
her
lips
trembled
and
throwing
her
arms
again
round
his
neck
she
laid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
beulah
do
you
cling
to
me
because
you
love
me
or
because
you
pity
me
or
because
you
are
grateful
to
me
for
past
love
and
kindness
answer
me
beulah
because
you
are
my
all
how
long
have
i
been
your
all
oh
longer
than
i
knew
myself
was
the
evasive
reply
he
tried
to
look
at
her
but
she
pressed
her
face
close
to
his
shoulder
and
would
not
suffer
it
beulah
sir
oh
do
me
child
i
want
to
know
the
truth
and
you
will
not
satisfy
me
i
have
told
you
the
truth
have
you
learned
that
fame
is
an
icy
shadow
that
gratified
ambition
can
not
make
you
happy
do
you
love
me
yes
better
than
teaching
school
and
writing
learned
articles
rather
better
i
believe
sir
beulah
well
sir
you
have
changed
in
many
things
since
we
parted
nearly
six
years
ago
yes
i
thank
god
i
am
changed
my
infidelity
was
a
source
of
many
sorrows
but
the
clouds
have
passed
from
my
mind
i
have
found
the
truth
in
holy
writ
now
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
him
very
earnestly
child
does
your
faith
make
you
happy
yes
the
universe
could
not
purchase
it
she
answered
solemnly
there
was
a
brief
silence
he
put
both
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
stooping
down
kissed
her
brow
and
you
prayed
for
me
beulah
yes
evening
and
morning
prayed
that
you
might
be
shielded
from
all
dangers
and
brought
safely
home
and
there
was
one
other
thing
which
i
prayed
for
not
less
fervently
than
for
your
return
that
god
would
melt
your
hard
bitter
heart
and
give
you
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
oh
sir
i
thought
sometimes
that
possibly
you
might
die
in
a
land
and
then
i
should
see
you
no
more
in
time
or
eternity
and
oh
the
thought
nearly
drove
me
wild
my
guardian
my
all
let
me
not
have
prayed
in
vain
she
clasped
his
hand
in
hers
and
looked
up
pleadingly
into
the
loved
face
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
saw
tears
glistening
in
the
burning
eyes
he
said
nothing
however
took
her
face
in
his
hands
and
scanned
it
earnestly
as
if
reading
all
that
had
passed
during
his
long
absence
presently
he
asked
so
you
would
not
marry
lindsay
and
go
to
congress
why
not
who
told
you
anything
about
him
no
matter
why
did
not
you
marry
him
because
i
did
not
love
him
he
is
a
generous
man
yes
very
i
do
not
know
his
superior
what
i
mean
what
i
say
said
she
firmly
he
smiled
one
of
his
genial
irresistible
smiles
and
she
smiled
also
despite
herself
give
me
your
hand
beulah
she
did
so
very
quietly
there
is
it
mine
yes
sir
if
you
want
it
and
may
i
claim
it
as
soon
as
i
choose
yes
sir
she
had
never
seen
him
look
as
he
did
then
his
face
kindled
as
if
in
a
broad
flash
of
light
the
eyes
dazzled
her
and
she
turned
her
face
away
as
he
drew
her
once
more
to
his
bosom
and
exclaimed
at
last
then
after
years
of
sorrow
and
pain
and
bitterness
i
shall
be
happy
in
my
own
home
shall
have
a
wife
a
companion
who
loves
me
for
myself
alone
ah
beulah
my
idol
i
will
make
you
happy
the
rain
fell
heavily
and
it
grew
dark
for
the
night
came
rapidly
down
there
was
a
furious
ringing
of
the
library
bell
the
doctor
had
come
home
and
as
usual
wanted
half
a
dozen
things
at
once
have
you
seen
dr
asbury
no
i
came
directly
to
the
house
saw
no
one
as
i
entered
and
hearing
the
melodeon
followed
the
sound
what
a
joyful
surprise
it
will
be
to
him
said
beulah
closing
the
window
and
locking
the
melodeon
she
led
the
way
down
the
steps
followed
by
her
guardian
and
charon
suppose
you
wait
a
while
in
the
music
room
it
adjoins
the
library
and
you
can
see
and
hear
without
being
seen
suggested
she
with
her
hand
on
the
bolt
of
the
door
he
assented
and
stood
near
the
threshold
which
connected
the
rooms
while
beulah
went
into
the
library
the
gas
burned
brightly
and
the
doctor
sat
leaning
far
back
in
his
armchair
with
his
feet
on
an
ottoman
his
wife
stood
near
him
stroking
the
gray
hair
from
his
furrowed
brow

into
it
again
before
bedtime
one
of
my
delectable
patients
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
treat
his
wife
and
children
to
a
rare
show
in
the
shape
of
a
fit
of
and
ten
to
one
i
shall
have
to
play
spectator
all
night
he
yawned
as
he
spoke
you
have
an
arduous
time
indeed
began
beulah
but
he
hastily
put
in
oh
of
all
poor
devils
we
gentry
do
have
the
hardest
times
i
am
sick
of
patients
sick
of
physic
sick
of
the
very
sound
of
my
own
name
if
my
guardian
were
only
here
to
relieve
confound
your
guardian
do
mention
him
in
my
presence
he
is
a
simpleton
he
is
what
the
shepherd
calls
a
you
have
no
guardian
i
can
tell
you
that
before
this
he
has
gone
through
all
the
transmigrations
of
and
the
final
metempsychosis
gave
him
to
the
world
a
celestial
yes
child
a
celestial
i
fancy
him
at
this
instant
with
two
long
plaits
of
hair
trailing
behind
him
as
with
all
the
sublime
complacency
of
celestials
he
stalks
majestically
along
picking
tea
leaves
confound
your
guardian
mention
his
name
to
me
again
at
the
peril
of
having
your
board
raised
george
what
is
the
matter
with
you
asked
his
wife
smiling
as
she
handed
him
the
lemonade
he
had
desired
this
prating
young
woman
is
as
usual
trying
to
discourse
of
alice
this
is
just
right
thank
you
my
dear
he
drained
the
glass
and
handed
it
back
beulah
stood
so
that
the
light
shone
full
on
her
face
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
exclaimed
come
here
child
what
ails
you
why
bless
my
soul
beulah
what
is
the
matter
i
never
saw
the
blood
in
your
face
before
and
your
great
solemn
eyes
seem
to
be
dancing
a
jig
what
ails
you
child
he
grasped
her
hands
eagerly
nothing
ails
me
i
am
well
i
know
better
has
charon
gone
mad
and
bit
you
oho
by
all
the
dead
gods
of
greece
guy
has
come
home
where
is
he
where
is
he
he
sprang
up
nearly
knocking
his
wife
down
and
looked
around
the
room
hartwell
emerged
from
the
music
room
and
advanced
to
meet
him
oh
guy
you
heathen
you
philistine
you
prodigal
he
bounded
over
a
chair
and
locked
his
arms
round
the
tall
form
while
his
gray
head
dropped
on
his
friend
shoulder
beulah
stole
out
quickly
and
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
room
fell
on
her
knees
and
returned
thanks
to
the
god
who
hears
and
answers
prayer
chapter
xli
it
was
a
sparkling
august
morning
one
of
those
rare
days
when
all
nature
seems
jubilant
the
waters
of
the
bay
glittered
like
a
sheet
of
molten
silver
the
soft
southern
breeze
sang
through
the
treetops
and
the
cloudless
sky
wore
that
deep
shade
of
pure
blue
which
is
nowhere
so
beautiful
as
in
our
sunny
south
clad
in
a
dress
of
spotless
white
with
her
luxuriant
hair
braided
and
twined
with
white
flowers
beulah
stood
beside
her
window
looking
out
into
the
street
below
her
hands
were
clasped
tightly
over
her
heart
and
on
one
slender
finger
blazed
a
costly
diamond
the
seal
of
her
betrothal
she
was
very
pale
now
and
then
her
lips
quivered
and
her
lashes
were
wet
with
tears
yet
this
was
her
marriage
day
she
had
just
risen
from
her
knees
and
her
countenance
told
of
a
troubled
heart
she
loved
her
guardian
above
everything
else
knew
that
separated
from
him
life
would
be
a
dreary
blank
to
her
yet
much
as
she
loved
him
she
could
not
divest
herself
of
a
species
of
fear
of
dread
the
thought
of
being
his
wife
filled
her
with
vague
apprehension
he
had
hastened
the
marriage
the
old
place
had
been
thoroughly
repaired
and
refurnished
and
this
morning
she
would
go
home
a
wife
she
clasped
her
hands
over
her
eyes
the
future
looked
fearful
she
knew
the
passionate
exacting
nature
of
the
man
with
whose
destiny
she
was
about
to
link
her
own
and
she
shrank
back
as
the
image
of
creola
rose
before
her
the
door
opened
and
asbury
entered
accompanied
by
hartwell
the
orphan
looked
up
and
leaned
heavily
against
the
window
asbury
broke
the
silence
they
are
waiting
for
you
my
dear
the
minister
came
some
moments
ago
the
clock
has
struck
ten
she
handed
her
a
pair
of
gloves
from
the
table
and
stood
in
the
door
waiting
for
her
beulah
drew
them
on
and
then
with
a
long
breath
glanced
at
hartwell
he
looked
restless
and
she
thought
sterner
than
she
had
seen
him
since
his
return
he
was
very
pale
and
his
lips
were
compressed
firmly
you
look
frightened
beulah
you
tremble
said
he
drawing
her
arm
through
his
and
fixing
his
eyes
searchingly
on
her
face
yes
oh
yes
i
believe
i
am
frightened
she
answered
with
a
constrained
smile
she
saw
his
brow
darken
and
his
cheek
flush
but
he
said
no
more
and
led
her
down
to
the
parlor
where
the
members
of
the
family
were
assembled
claudia
and
eugene
were
also
present
the
minister
met
them
in
the
center
of
the
room
and
there
in
the
solemn
hush
a
few
questions
were
answered
a
plain
band
of
gold
encircled
her
finger
and
the
deep
tones
of
the
clergyman
pronounced
her
guy
wife
eugene
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
tenderly
whispering
god
bless
you
dear
sister
and
friend
i
sincerely
hope
that
your
married
life
will
prove
happier
than
mine
their
congratulations
wearied
her
and
she
was
glad
when
the
carriage
came
to
bear
her
away
bidding
adieu
to
her
friends
she
was
handed
into
the
carriage
and
hartwell
took
the
seat
beside
her
the
ride
was
short
neither
spoke
and
when
the
door
was
opened
and
she
entered
the
house
she
would
gladly
have
retreated
to
the
greenhouse
and
sought
solitude
to
collect
her
thoughts
but
a
hand
caught
hers
and
she
soon
found
herself
seated
on
a
sofa
in
the
study
she
felt
that
a
pair
of
eyes
were
riveted
on
her
face
and
suddenly
the
blood
surged
into
her
white
cheeks
her
hand
lay
clasped
in
his
and
her
head
drooped
lower
to
avoid
his
searching
gaze
oh
beulah
my
wife
why
are
you
afraid
of
me
the
low
musical
tones
caused
her
heart
to
thrill
strangely
she
made
a
great
effort
and
lifted
her
head
she
saw
the
expression
of
sorrow
that
clouded
his
face
saw
his
white
brow
wrinkle
and
as
her
eyes
fell
on
the
silver
threads
scattered
through
his
brown
hair
there
came
an
instant
revolution
of
feeling
fear
vanished
love
reigned
supreme
she
threw
her
arms
up
about
his
neck
and
exclaimed
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
now
may
god
bless
my
guardian
my
husband
reader
marriage
is
not
the
end
of
life
it
is
but
the
beginning
of
a
new
course
of
duties
but
i
can
not
now
follow
beulah
henceforth
her
history
is
bound
up
with
another
to
save
her
husband
from
his
unbelief
is
the
labor
of
future
years
she
had
learned
to
suffer
and
to
bear
patiently
and
though
her
path
looks
sunny
and
her
heart
throbs
with
happy
hopes
this
one
shadow
lurks
over
her
home
and
dims
her
joys
weeks
and
months
glided
swiftly
on
face
lost
its
stern
rigidity
and
his
smile
became
constantly
genial
his
wife
was
his
idol
day
by
day
his
love
for
her
seemed
more
completely
to
revolutionize
his
nature
his
cynicism
melted
insensibly
away
his
lips
forgot
their
iron
compression
now
and
then
his
laugh
rang
through
the
house
beulah
was
conscious
of
the
power
she
wielded
and
trembled
lest
she
failed
to
employ
it
properly
one
sabbath
afternoon
she
sat
in
her
room
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
absorbed
in
earnest
thought
her
little
bible
lay
on
her
lap
and
she
was
pondering
the
text
she
had
heard
that
morning
charon
came
and
nestled
his
huge
head
against
her
presently
she
heard
the
quick
tramp
of
hoofs
and
whir
of
wheels
and
soon
after
her
husband
entered
and
sat
down
beside
her
what
are
you
thinking
of
said
he
passing
his
hand
over
her
head
caressingly
thinking
of
my
life
of
the
bygone
years
of
struggle
they
are
past
and
can
trouble
you
no
more
the
dead
past
bury
its
dead
no
my
past
can
never
die
i
ponder
it
often
and
it
does
me
good
strengthens
me
by
keeping
me
humble
i
was
just
thinking
of
the
dreary
desolate
days
and
nights
i
passed
searching
for
a
true
philosophy
and
going
further
astray
with
every
effort
i
was
so
proud
of
my
intellect
put
so
much
faith
in
my
own
powers
it
was
no
wonder
i
was
so
benighted
where
is
your
old
worship
of
genius
asked
her
husband
watching
her
curiously
i
have
not
lost
it
all
i
hope
i
never
shall
human
genius
has
accomplished
a
vast
deal
for
man
temporal
existence
the
physical
sciences
have
been
wheeled
forward
in
the
march
of
mind
and
earthly
path
gemmed
with
all
that
a
merely
sensual
nature
could
desire
but
looking
aside
from
these
channels
what
has
it
effected
for
philosophy
that
great
burden
which
constantly
recalls
the
fabled
labors
of
sisyphus
and
the
danaides
since
the
rising
of
bethlehem
star
in
the
cloudy
sky
of
polytheism
what
has
human
genius
discovered
of
god
eternity
destiny
metaphysicians
build
gorgeous
cloud
palaces
but
the
soul
can
not
dwell
in
their
cold
misty
atmosphere
antiquarians
wrangle
and
write
egypt
moldering
monuments
are
raked
from
their
desert
graves
and
made
the
theme
of
scientific
debate
but
has
all
this
learned
disputation
contributed
one
iota
to
clear
the
thorny
way
of
strict
morality
put
the
bible
out
of
sight
and
how
much
will
human
intellect
discover
concerning
our
ultimate
destiny
in
the
morning
of
time
sages
handled
these
vital
questions
and
died
not
one
step
nearer
the
truth
than
when
they
began
now
our
philosophers
struggle
earnestly
and
honestly
to
make
plain
the
same
inscrutable
mysteries
yes
blot
out
the
records
of
moses
and
we
would
grope
in
starless
night
for
notwithstanding
the
many
priceless
blessings
it
has
discovered
for
man
the
torch
of
science
will
never
pierce
and
illumine
the
recesses
over
which
almighty
god
has
hung
his
veil
here
we
see
indeed
as
a
glass
darkly
yet
i
believe
the
day
is
already
dawning
when
scientific
data
will
not
only
cease
to
be
antagonistic
to
scriptural
accounts
but
will
deepen
the
impress
of
divinity
on
the
pages
of
holy
writ
when
torch
shall
be
taken
out
of
the
hand
of
the
infidel
and
set
to
burn
in
the
temple
of
the
living
god
when
science
and
religion
shall
link
hands
i
revere
the
lonely
thinkers
to
whom
the
world
is
indebted
for
its
great
inventions
i
honor
the
tireless
laborers
who
toil
in
laboratories
who
sweep
midnight
skies
in
search
of
new
worlds
who
unheave
primeval
rocks
hunting
for
footsteps
of
deity
and
i
believe
that
every
scientific
fact
will
ultimately
prove
but
another
lamp
planted
along
the
path
which
leads
to
a
knowledge
of
jehovah
ah
it
is
indeed
peculiarly
the
duty
of
christians
watch
with
reverence
and
joy
the
unveiling
of
the
august
brow
of
nature
by
the
hand
of
science
and
to
be
ready
to
call
mankind
to
a
worship
ever
new
human
thought
subserves
many
useful
nay
noble
ends
the
creator
gave
it
as
a
powerful
instrument
to
improve
man
temporal
condition
but
oh
sir
i
speak
of
what
i
know
when
i
say
alas
for
that
soul
who
forsakes
the
divine
ark
and
embarks
on
the
gilded
toys
of
man
invention
hoping
to
breast
the
billows
of
life
and
be
anchored
safely
in
the
harbor
of
eternal
rest
the
heathens
no
law
are
a
law
unto
themselves
but
for
such
as
deliberately
reject
the
given
light
only
bitter
darkness
remains
i
know
it
for
i
too
once
groped
wailing
for
help
your
religion
is
full
of
mystery
said
her
husband
gravely
yes
of
divine
mystery
truly
god
comprehended
is
no
god
at
all
christianity
is
clear
as
to
rules
of
life
and
duty
there
is
no
mystery
left
about
the
directions
to
man
yet
there
is
a
divine
mystery
infolding
it
which
tells
of
its
divine
origin
and
promises
a
fuller
revelation
when
man
is
fitted
to
receive
it
if
it
were
not
so
we
would
call
it
man
invention
you
turn
from
revelation
because
it
contains
some
things
you
can
not
comprehend
yet
you
plunge
into
a
deeper
darker
mystery
when
you
embrace
the
theory
of
an
eternal
universe
having
no
intelligent
creator
yet
constantly
creating
intelligent
beings
sir
can
you
understand
how
matter
creates
mind
she
had
laid
her
bible
on
his
knee
her
folded
hands
rested
upon
it
and
her
gray
eyes
clear
and
earnest
looked
up
reverently
into
her
husband
noble
face
his
soft
hand
wandered
over
her
head
and
he
seemed
pondering
her
words
may
god
aid
the
wife
in
her
holy
work
of
love
