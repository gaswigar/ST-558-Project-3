my
dear
reader
i
first
saw
the
light
of
day
in
a
little
town
called
marietta
at
the
mouth
of
the
muskingum
river
in
the
state
of
ohio
on
the
first
day
of
august
i
was
the
youngest
of
six
children
and
was
the
pet
of
the
family
my
father
was
a
ship
carpenter
and
worked
at
in
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
i
had
good
opportunities
to
secure
an
early
education
as
we
had
good
schools
in
the
west
at
that
time
i
had
very
little
liking
for
books
and
much
less
for
school
when
my
parents
thought
me
at
school
i
was
playing
hookey
with
other
boys
running
about
the
river
kicking
playing
shinny
on
your
own
side
and
having
a
fight
nearly
every
day
i
hardly
ever
went
home
that
i
did
not
have
my
face
all
scratched
up
from
having
been
in
a
fight
which
innocent
amusement
i
loved
much
better
than
school
when
i
was
hardly
ten
years
of
age
i
would
carry
stones
in
my
pocket
and
tackle
the
school
teachers
if
they
attempted
to
whip
me
my
father
was
away
from
home
at
his
work
most
of
the
time
and
my
mother
god
bless
her
dear
old
soul
could
not
manage
me
she
has
often
called
in
some
to
help
her
punish
me
i
can
now
see
i
richly
deserved
all
the
punishment
i
ever
received
and
more
too
when
there
was
company
at
our
house
and
my
mother
would
be
busy
preparing
a
meal
i
would
get
my
bow
and
arrows
and
shoot
the
cups
off
from
the
table
and
then
run
away
i
guess
i
was
about
the
worst
boy
of
my
age
west
of
the
allegheny
mountains
that
was
born
of
good
christian
parents
i
have
often
heard
the
good
old
church
members
say
that
boy
will
be
hung
if
he
lives
to
be
twenty
years
old
but
i
have
fooled
them
and
am
still
on
the
turf
although
i
have
had
some
pretty
close
calls
as
you
will
see
by
reading
this
book
leaving
home
in
the
year
while
at
the
river
one
day
i
saw
a
steamer
lying
at
the
by
the
name
of
the
first
steward
said
i
could
ship
as
a
cabin
boy
at
per
month
i
thought
this
a
great
opportunity
so
when
the
boat
backed
out
i
was
on
board
without
saying
anything
to
my
parents
or
any
one
else
my
first
duty
was
to
scour
knives
i
knew
they
would
stand
no
foolishness
so
at
it
i
went
and
worked
like
a
little
trooper
and
by
so
doing
i
gained
the
good
will
of
the
steward
at
night
i
was
told
to
get
a
mattress
and
sleep
on
the
floor
of
the
cabin
this
i
was
very
glad
to
do
as
i
was
tired
about
four
in
the
morning
the
second
steward
came
up
to
me
and
gave
me
a
pretty
hard
kick
in
the
side
that
hurt
me
and
called
out
get
up
here
and
put
your
mattress
away
i
did
get
up
and
put
away
my
bed
and
then
i
went
to
the
steward
who
kicked
me
and
said
look
here
do
kick
me
that
way
again
for
you
hurt
me
he
let
go
and
hit
me
a
slap
in
the
face
that
made
my
ears
ring
so
into
him
i
pitched
i
was
a
big
boy
for
only
ten
years
old
but
i
struck
the
wrong
man
that
time
for
he
hit
me
another
lick
in
the
nose
that
came
very
near
sending
me
to
grass
but
i
rallied
and
came
again
this
time
i
had
a
piece
of
stone
coal
that
i
grabbed
out
of
a
bucket
i
let
it
fly
and
it
caught
him
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
brought
him
to
his
knees
by
this
time
the
passengers
were
getting
up
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
pilot
and
first
steward
soon
put
a
stop
to
the
fight
i
told
my
story
to
the
boss
and
he
took
sides
with
me
he
told
the
officers
of
the
boat
that
i
was
the
best
boy
to
work
that
he
had
so
they
discharged
the
second
steward
at
cincinnati
and
you
can
bet
i
was
glad
i
remained
on
the
for
some
time
and
thought
myself
a
good
steamboat
man
i
knew
it
all
for
i
had
been
there
the
next
boat
i
shipped
on
was
the
at
per
month
you
could
hear
her
scape
whistle
for
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
on
a
clear
day
or
night
i
would
get
up
early
in
the
morning
and
make
some
pieces
there
were
no
nickels
in
those
days
by
blacking
boots
put
ashore
for
fighting
i
quit
the
after
three
months
and
shipped
with
captain
patterson
on
the
bound
for
nashville
the
first
trip
up
the
cumberland
river
the
boat
was
full
of
passengers
and
i
had
a
fight
with
the
pantryman
the
captain
said
i
should
go
ashore
they
brought
me
up
to
the
office
and
the
clerk
was
told
to
pay
me
my
wages
which
amounted
to
the
large
sum
of
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
i
was
told
to
get
my
baggage
but
as
two
blue
cotton
shirts
and
what
i
had
on
my
back
was
all
i
possessed
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
pack
my
trunk
was
a
piece
of
brown
paper
with
a
pin
lock
they
landed
me
at
a
point
where
the
bank
was
about
one
hundred
feet
high
and
so
steep
that
a
goat
could
not
climb
it
they
commenced
to
pull
in
the
plank
when
the
steward
yelled
out
to
the
captain
that
he
could
not
get
along
without
that
boy
and
asked
him
to
let
me
go
as
far
as
nashville
i
was
told
to
come
aboard
which
i
did
and
i
remained
on
that
boat
for
one
year
during
which
time
i
learned
to
play
and
to
steal
card
so
that
i
could
cheat
the
boys
and
i
felt
as
if
i
was
fixed
for
life
i
quit
the
and
shipped
with
captain
mason
on
the
steamer
bill
campbell
afterward
the
first
captain
of
the
was
a
cabin
boy
on
the
same
boat
he
is
now
a
captain
in
the
vicksburg
packet
line
during
the
time
i
was
on
the
the
mexican
war
broke
out
war
with
mexico
lands
intersected
by
a
narrow
frith
abhor
each
other
mountains
interposed
make
enemies
of
nations
who
had
else
like
kindred
drops
been
mingled
into
one
when
the
mexican
war
broke
out
our
boat
was
lying
at
pittsburg
the
government
bought
a
new
boat
called
the
that
had
just
been
built
at
brownsville
a
cousin
of
mine
was
engaged
to
pilot
her
on
the
rio
grande
his
name
was
press
devol
he
was
a
good
pilot
on
the
ohio
from
cincinnati
to
pittsburg
but
had
never
seen
the
rio
grande
except
on
the
map
i
thought
i
would
like
to
go
to
war
and
to
mexico
my
cousin
got
me
the
position
as
barkeeper
so
i
quit
our
boat
and
shipped
on
the
for
the
war
jack
mccourtney
of
wheeling
was
the
owner
of
the
bar
there
was
a
man
aboard
on
our
way
down
who
took
a
great
liking
to
me
he
was
well
posted
on
cards
and
taught
me
to
stock
a
deck
so
i
could
give
a
man
a
big
hand
so
i
was
a
second
time
fixed
for
life
when
we
got
down
to
new
orleans
they
took
the
boat
over
to
algiers
took
her
guards
off
and
part
of
her
cabin
and
we
started
across
the
gulf
and
you
bet
my
hair
stood
up
at
times
when
those
big
swells
would
go
clear
over
her
in
a
storm
but
finally
we
landed
at
bagdad
and
commenced
to
load
her
with
supplies
for
the
army
i
soon
got
tired
of
the
rio
grande
and
after
cheating
all
the
soldiers
that
i
could
at
cards
as
there
was
no
one
else
to
rob
i
took
a
vessel
and
came
back
to
new
orleans
when
i
landed
there
i
was
very
comfortably
fixed
as
i
had
about
and
was
not
quite
seventeen
years
old
here
i
was
in
a
big
city
and
knew
no
one
so
i
went
and
got
a
boarding
house
and
left
all
my
cash
but
what
i
might
need
in
the
care
of
an
old
gentleman
that
looked
something
like
my
father
i
thought
he
must
be
honest
as
he
looked
like
him
and
he
proved
himself
so
i
then
picked
up
courage
and
said
to
myself
i
believe
that
i
will
go
home
but
to
pay
passage
was
all
foolishness
as
i
was
such
a
good
hand
on
a
boat
so
i
shipped
on
the
steamboat
captain
montgomery
and
windy
marshall
as
they
called
him
mate
i
shipped
as
second
steward
at
twenty
dollars
per
month
the
boat
was
full
of
people
and
the
card
tables
were
going
ever
night
as
soon
as
the
supper
tables
were
cleared
we
had
been
out
from
new
orleans
two
days
and
nights
before
i
picked
up
a
game
one
afternoon
in
the
texas
i
beat
my
man
out
of
and
as
there
was
no
squeal
in
those
days
i
was
all
right
although
they
did
not
allow
any
of
the
crew
to
play
with
passengers
we
got
to
louisville
where
the
boat
laid
up
and
paid
off
her
crew
and
i
came
on
to
cincinnati
home
again
be
it
a
weakness
it
deserves
some
praise
we
love
the
of
our
early
days
well
now
i
go
home
to
the
folks
i
said
and
see
if
they
will
forgive
me
i
thought
i
would
take
home
some
presents
so
i
bought
about
worth
of
goods
including
coffee
sugar
teas
and
took
the
old
steamer
of
pittsburg
captain
clinefelter
master
you
ought
to
have
seen
me
when
i
stepped
on
the
wharfboat
at
marietta
my
birthplace
dressed
to
death
with
my
gold
watch
and
chain
and
a
fine
trunk
i
had
bought
in
new
orleans
for
i
got
my
groceries
off
the
wharfboat
and
hired
a
wagon
and
i
took
it
afoot
as
in
those
days
you
could
not
get
a
hack
except
at
a
livery
stable
my
mother
knew
me
at
first
sight
father
was
working
at
the
yard
at
port
homer
on
the
other
side
of
the
muskingum
river
and
did
not
come
home
until
night
i
stopped
at
home
a
year
and
had
a
fight
nearly
every
week
i
then
came
to
cincinnati
again
where
i
met
my
brother
paul
who
was
working
at
calking
steamboats
he
coaxed
me
to
stay
with
him
saying
that
he
would
teach
me
the
trade
i
consented
and
soon
was
able
to
earn
per
day
we
worked
together
a
few
years
and
made
a
good
deal
of
money
but
every
monday
morning
i
went
to
work
broke
i
became
infatuated
with
the
game
of
faro
and
it
kept
me
a
slave
so
i
concluded
either
to
quit
work
or
quit
gambling
i
studied
the
matter
over
a
long
time
at
last
one
day
while
we
were
finishing
a
boat
that
we
had
calked
and
were
working
on
a
float
aft
of
the
wheel
i
gave
my
tools
a
push
with
my
foot
and
they
all
went
into
the
river
my
brother
called
out
and
asked
me
what
i
was
doing
i
looked
up
a
little
sheepish
and
said
it
was
the
last
lick
of
work
i
would
ever
do
he
was
surprised
to
hear
me
talk
that
way
and
asked
me
what
i
intended
to
do
i
told
him
i
intended
to
live
off
of
fools
and
suckers
i
also
said
i
will
make
money
rain
and
i
did
come
near
doing
as
i
said
the
game
of
rondo
after
shoving
my
calking
tools
into
the
river
i
went
to
keeping
a
rondo
game
for
daniel
and
joseph
smith
up
on
fifth
street
at
per
week
hundreds
of
dollars
changed
hands
every
hour
both
day
and
night
at
the
end
of
six
months
i
was
taken
in
as
a
partner
and
at
that
time
the
receipts
of
the
game
were
about
every
day
i
had
money
to
sell
or
throw
away
and
for
a
boy
i
made
it
fly
in
a
short
time
the
police
began
to
raid
us
and
we
would
be
fined
fifty
dollars
each
about
once
a
month
then
they
raised
it
to
and
next
to
this
was
too
much
so
we
had
heavy
oak
and
iron
doors
put
up
but
the
police
would
batter
them
down
and
get
us
just
the
same
one
night
they
surrounded
the
house
broke
down
the
door
and
arrested
my
two
partners
but
i
escaped
by
the
roof
the
next
day
i
went
up
to
the
jail
to
take
the
boys
something
to
eat
when
they
nabbed
and
locked
me
up
also
they
put
me
in
the
same
cell
with
kissane
of
the
steamer
notoriety
who
was
living
in
great
style
at
the
jail
they
fined
us
each
and
let
us
go
and
that
broke
up
rondo
after
retiring
from
the
rondo
business
i
took
passage
with
captain
riddle
on
the
steamer
bound
for
the
wabash
river
to
visit
a
sister
who
lived
near
bloomfield
edgar
county
ills
there
were
no
railroads
in
that
part
of
the
country
in
those
days
my
sister
husband
bought
acres
of
land
near
paris
at
per
acre
and
the
same
land
is
now
worth
per
acre
during
my
trip
up
the
river
i
formed
the
acquaintance
of
sam
burges
who
was
a
great
circus
man
captain
riddle
and
burges
got
to
paying
poker
and
the
captain
bested
him
for
about
i
told
burges
that
i
could
make
him
win
if
he
could
get
me
into
the
game
so
after
supper
they
sat
down
to
play
and
i
was
a
burges
asked
me
to
take
a
hand
which
i
did
and
on
my
deal
i
would
fill
his
hand
so
that
he
soon
had
the
captain
badly
rattled
and
he
lost
about
the
old
captain
was
getting
full
and
i
looked
for
a
fight
sooner
or
later
burges
invited
all
to
take
a
drink
when
the
captain
refused
and
told
burges
that
he
was
a
d
d
gambler
burges
called
him
a
liar
so
at
it
they
went
the
captain
was
getting
the
best
of
it
when
we
parted
them
and
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
keep
burges
from
shooting
i
got
of
the
and
no
one
called
me
a
gambler
either
as
the
boat
was
going
through
the
draw
at
terre
haute
she
took
a
shear
on
the
pilot
and
knocked
down
her
chimneys
the
captain
went
up
on
deck
cursed
the
pilot
went
down
on
the
lower
deck
knocked
down
two
and
raised
cain
generally
burges
expected
he
would
tackle
him
again
but
the
captain
did
not
want
any
of
that
gun
when
we
arrived
at
the
landing
i
got
off
and
went
to
my
sister
i
remained
there
about
one
month
and
had
a
good
time
shooting
wild
turkeys
and
chickens
on
my
return
trip
i
got
into
a
game
of
poker
and
took
in
a
few
hundred
i
stopped
off
at
louisville
a
short
time
and
then
shipped
for
cincinnati
where
i
remained
until
i
was
very
near
broke
now
a
gambler
if
yet
you
love
game
at
so
dear
a
rate
learn
this
that
hath
old
gamesters
dearly
cost
dost
lose
rise
up
dost
win
rise
in
that
state
who
strives
to
sit
out
losing
hands
are
lost
i
left
cincinnati
for
louis
and
when
i
landed
there
i
had
just
left
i
secured
a
boarding
house
and
started
to
take
in
the
town
i
made
inquiries
for
a
faro
bank
and
at
last
found
one
and
i
bolted
in
as
if
i
was
an
old
sport
i
stepped
up
to
the
table
and
asked
the
dealer
for
worth
of
checks
i
then
commenced
to
play
and
won
and
pressing
my
good
luck
in
two
hours
had
in
checks
in
front
of
me
i
told
the
dealer
to
cash
my
checks
and
i
walked
out
the
next
day
i
was
on
my
way
to
paul
as
at
that
time
there
was
a
great
emigration
in
that
direction
i
took
passage
on
a
steamer
that
had
nearly
people
on
board
going
there
to
buy
homes
and
of
course
they
had
plenty
of
money
with
them
after
the
supper
tables
were
cleared
a
game
of
poker
was
commenced
then
another
then
another
until
there
were
five
tables
going
i
sat
at
one
of
the
tables
looking
on
for
a
long
time
until
at
length
one
of
the
gentlemen
said
to
me
do
you
ever
indulge
i
said
hardly
ever
but
i
do
not
care
if
i
play
a
while
the
bar
was
open
and
they
all
appeared
to
enjoy
a
good
drink
but
i
never
cared
for
anything
stronger
than
a
lemonade
the
result
was
that
they
all
got
full
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
have
some
of
their
money
as
to
let
the
barkeeper
have
it
and
i
commenced
to
try
some
of
the
tricks
i
had
learned
i
found
they
worked
finely
and
at
daybreak
the
bar
and
i
had
all
the
money
i
got
about
which
made
me
strong
when
we
arrived
at
paul
i
struck
another
bank
and
to
my
sorrow
i
found
one
conducted
by
cole
martin
and
king
cole
two
old
sports
who
soon
relieved
me
of
my
i
then
was
without
a
cent
and
too
game
to
let
the
gamblers
know
i
was
broke
after
i
had
been
there
about
a
week
one
of
them
stopped
me
on
the
street
and
asked
me
why
i
did
not
come
around
and
see
them
he
said
i
do
ask
you
to
play
but
come
and
dine
with
us
i
accepted
his
invitation
and
went
around
that
evening
and
had
as
fine
a
bird
supper
as
i
ever
sat
down
to
my
first
keno
is
not
enough
to
help
the
feeble
up
but
to
support
him
after
the
next
day
i
visited
another
where
they
had
keno
going
at
fifty
cents
a
card
i
had
seen
it
before
and
took
a
great
fancy
to
the
game
i
inquired
how
much
an
outfit
would
cost
they
said
they
had
two
keno
sets
and
if
i
wanted
one
they
would
sell
it
to
me
for
now
came
the
tug
of
war
how
to
get
the
keno
i
at
last
thought
of
a
plan
and
that
was
to
borrow
the
amount
of
one
of
the
dealers
who
had
won
the
from
me
so
i
made
a
bold
front
and
told
him
what
i
wanted
to
do
and
he
gave
me
in
cash
saying
at
the
same
time
pay
me
when
you
are
able
as
i
like
to
help
a
young
man
who
tries
to
help
himself
i
bought
the
keno
set
and
had
left
which
paid
all
my
debts
and
started
me
in
business
cole
martin
one
of
the
men
who
loaned
me
the
money
said
to
me
now
after
the
faro
bank
closes
at
my
house
if
you
bring
your
keno
over
i
will
help
you
get
up
a
game
all
right
i
said
so
i
took
it
over
and
opened
on
the
billiard
tables
and
he
brought
all
of
his
players
into
the
room
and
said
let
us
start
this
young
man
game
they
commenced
playing
at
per
card
at
twelve
and
at
six
in
the
morning
they
were
playing
at
per
card
i
was
taking
out
per
cent
they
all
got
stuck
that
night
my
receipts
amounted
to
the
result
was
they
put
the
carpenters
at
work
to
fit
up
a
nice
room
for
me
and
in
eight
months
my
part
of
the
game
was
then
i
began
to
think
i
was
a
blooded
boy
and
soon
began
to
take
the
girls
out
riding
and
to
wine
suppers
and
to
play
the
bank
higher
than
a
cat
back
as
the
old
keno
game
was
a
great
producer
about
this
time
the
town
of
winona
was
looking
up
there
were
but
two
or
three
little
frame
houses
but
a
great
many
people
got
off
there
going
back
in
the
country
so
i
went
down
there
and
bought
a
raft
of
great
lumber
hired
carpenters
and
put
them
to
work
building
houses
they
soon
had
five
or
six
done
and
in
about
a
week
after
they
were
finished
you
could
stand
outside
and
throw
a
big
dog
through
the
cracks
but
they
were
full
every
night
at
per
head
bringing
their
own
blankets
and
sleeping
on
the
floor
i
sent
and
got
another
keno
set
and
opened
a
bar
room
and
was
making
money
like
dirt
when
one
day
a
man
walked
in
with
a
bucket
of
water
and
commenced
pouring
it
on
one
of
my
billiard
tables
that
i
got
in
chicago
and
which
cost
me
i
walked
up
to
him
and
asked
him
what
he
was
doing
he
told
me
to
go
to
h
i
let
fly
caught
him
on
the
neck
and
down
he
went
and
he
lay
there
for
some
time
finally
they
took
him
to
where
he
and
his
wife
were
stopping
and
that
night
he
died
then
i
commenced
to
think
about
getting
out
of
that
hot
box
i
got
together
what
money
i
could
and
carried
a
canoe
to
the
river
and
started
for
dubuque
there
were
no
telegraph
lines
at
that
time
i
had
been
there
but
a
few
days
before
the
news
came
to
me
that
the
doctors
had
held
a
post
mortem
examination
and
decided
the
man
had
had
delirium
tremens
and
could
only
have
lived
a
short
time
they
sawed
open
his
skull
and
found
his
brain
a
jelly
in
the
center
so
i
went
back
and
found
his
wife
gave
her
one
of
the
houses
which
i
had
built
and
in
money
i
then
put
a
man
in
charge
of
my
business
and
went
back
to
paul
where
my
keno
games
were
still
going
on
but
the
man
i
left
in
charge
of
my
business
at
winona
sold
all
he
could
and
skipped
out
and
that
was
the
last
seen
of
him
till
i
went
up
the
missouri
river
two
years
after
when
i
found
him
in
kansas
city
at
that
time
there
were
but
three
or
four
houses
and
a
hotel
down
at
the
river
bank
it
was
a
great
point
for
the
santa
fé
traders
i
became
acquainted
with
a
man
named
mcgee
who
owned
the
largest
part
of
kansas
city
he
was
a
great
lover
of
the
game
of
up
so
we
commenced
to
play
at
a
game
and
i
beat
him
out
of
five
lots
as
he
had
no
money
which
i
afterward
sold
at
a
piece
twelve
years
ago
as
i
passed
through
there
i
saw
those
same
lots
bringing
per
foot
i
went
from
there
to
joe
omaha
and
council
bluffs
and
broke
a
great
many
fellows
playing
poker
i
then
settled
down
at
dealing
faro
in
joseph
mo
after
staying
there
one
year
i
went
to
louis
where
i
remained
two
or
three
months
and
then
went
to
new
orleans
i
landed
there
in
the
yellow
fever
was
raging
there
being
deaths
per
day
then
was
the
time
if
there
was
any
fright
in
the
young
gambler
for
it
to
have
shown
itself
but
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
i
had
to
go
i
might
as
well
go
then
as
at
any
other
time
i
was
taken
down
with
the
fever
and
nurses
were
scarce
but
i
got
an
old
colored
woman
and
told
her
to
stick
to
me
and
i
would
give
her
per
day
as
long
as
i
was
sick
and
if
i
handed
in
my
checks
she
might
have
all
i
left
in
days
by
the
grace
of
our
good
maker
i
was
up
eating
chicken
soup
they
watched
me
so
close
i
could
get
nothing
else
during
this
time
i
got
an
answer
from
a
letter
written
to
my
partner
at
paul
telling
him
to
sell
out
as
best
he
could
and
to
send
me
my
part
which
he
did
indians
can
play
poker
the
year
i
was
in
paul
they
paid
off
a
lot
of
indians
a
short
distance
from
the
town
i
was
told
that
the
red
man
was
a
good
poker
player
and
was
always
looking
for
the
best
of
it
they
paid
them
in
silver
so
i
got
some
of
the
hard
money
hired
a
horse
and
buggy
got
some
whisky
and
started
out
to
give
them
a
game
more
for
the
fun
and
novelty
of
the
thing
than
to
win
their
money
for
i
had
the
old
keno
game
running
and
she
was
a
good
producer
when
i
got
among
the
savages
they
were
having
a
war
dance
after
the
dance
they
smoked
the
pipe
of
peace
and
drank
my
whisky
and
i
smoked
their
pipes
after
the
friendly
smoking
was
over
they
started
in
to
playing
poker
they
invited
and
insisted
on
me
changing
in
so
at
last
i
sat
down
and
took
a
hand
one
of
the
old
bucks
soon
began
to
cheat
he
had
an
old
hat
in
front
of
him
and
inside
of
the
hat
he
had
a
so
that
he
could
see
on
his
deal
every
card
he
dealt
out
i
knew
he
was
after
me
so
i
told
him
to
put
the
hat
away
and
play
fair
he
saw
that
i
was
no
sucker
so
he
put
it
away
we
played
for
some
time
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
even
by
playing
on
the
square
with
big
injins
as
i
found
them
very
good
card
players
i
held
out
a
hand
but
had
to
wait
some
time
for
the
wild
man
of
the
forest
at
last
there
was
a
big
blind
and
straddle
and
i
kept
raising
it
before
the
draw
they
all
stayed
and
drew
two
or
three
cards
i
do
not
remember
which
i
took
one
and
when
we
came
to
show
down
i
was
the
lucky
fellow
this
was
too
much
for
the
bucks
so
three
of
them
dropped
out
and
left
an
old
chief
and
myself
as
i
was
over
ahead
of
the
game
i
played
liberally
to
draw
the
old
chieftain
on
and
as
he
had
one
of
his
bucks
walking
around
behind
and
talking
big
injin
all
the
time
he
was
getting
the
best
of
me
i
knew
that
my
hands
were
being
given
away
but
i
did
not
let
them
know
that
i
was
onto
their
racket
i
waited
my
chance
and
clinched
onto
four
fours
and
a
jack
i
kept
going
blind
until
the
chief
got
a
good
hand
and
then
he
came
back
at
me
strong
we
had
it
hot
and
heavy
i
let
the
buck
see
my
hand
until
it
came
to
the
draw
and
then
i
shifted
the
hand
and
came
up
with
the
four
fours
and
the
jack
but
the
warrior
did
not
see
me
get
hand
i
then
made
a
big
bet
the
old
chief
called
his
squaw
and
she
brought
him
a
sack
of
silver
he
then
called
me
we
showed
down
the
money
was
mine
and
then
you
should
have
seen
the
fun
the
buck
that
had
been
giving
my
hand
away
started
to
run
the
old
chief
jumped
up
grabbed
his
tomahawk
and
lit
out
after
him
i
jerked
off
my
coat
dumped
all
the
silver
into
it
jumped
into
my
buggy
and
lost
no
time
in
getting
out
of
that
neck
of
the
woods
as
i
was
going
at
a
gait
i
looked
back
and
saw
the
buck
and
old
chief
going
through
the
woods
i
never
knew
whether
the
old
man
caught
the
buck
or
not
but
i
do
know
he
did
not
catch
me
i
took
desperate
chances
to
win
that
pot
and
i
was
very
lucky
in
not
losing
my
scalp
i
never
inquired
when
the
indians
were
to
be
paid
off
again
for
i
had
no
notion
of
paying
them
a
visit
any
one
who
has
a
desire
to
play
poker
with
big
injins
has
my
consent
but
i
would
advise
them
to
play
a
square
game
and
keep
their
eye
skinned
for
the
big
buck
that
talks
to
the
chief
a
religious
captain
i
was
on
board
the
steamer
going
from
dubuque
to
paul
the
captain
was
a
member
of
the
church
and
did
not
allow
any
gambling
on
his
boat
and
any
one
caught
at
that
innocent
pastime
would
be
put
ashore
while
walking
over
the
boat
i
met
a
gentlemen
who
i
thought
had
money
and
i
hardly
ever
made
a
mistake
in
my
man
i
invited
him
to
join
me
in
a
drink
and
then
steered
him
into
the
barber
shop
i
told
him
i
had
lost
some
money
betting
on
cards
but
i
did
not
mind
very
much
as
my
father
was
wealthy
while
i
was
showing
him
how
i
had
lost
the
money
my
partner
came
and
after
watching
me
throw
the
cards
for
a
little
while
he
wanted
to
bet
me
he
could
pick
the
card
i
threw
them
again
and
told
him
to
put
up
he
turned
and
won
the
money
then
turning
to
the
man
he
showed
him
one
of
the
corners
turned
up
and
wanted
to
bet
me
again
i
told
him
i
would
not
play
with
a
man
that
beat
me
the
man
then
asked
me
if
i
would
bet
with
him
i
said
i
would
providing
the
other
fellow
would
not
tell
him
which
card
to
turn
which
was
agreed
to
the
man
then
got
out
his
big
roll
and
put
up
i
told
him
if
he
won
i
would
only
bet
him
the
one
time
and
if
i
won
i
would
only
be
even
and
that
i
would
not
bet
less
than
he
put
up
the
and
turned
the
wrong
card
after
putting
the
money
out
of
sight
i
began
to
throw
the
cards
again
for
i
saw
a
diamond
stud
and
ring
worth
about
while
the
cards
were
on
the
table
i
turned
around
to
spit
and
my
partner
marked
one
of
the
cards
with
a
pencil
and
let
the
man
see
the
mark
he
then
bet
me
and
won
it
then
he
walked
away
the
man
began
to
get
nervous
and
feel
for
his
money
but
he
had
only
about
dollars
left
and
wanted
to
bet
that
i
told
him
i
had
just
lost
and
would
not
bet
less
than
he
insisted
on
betting
the
but
i
told
him
to
keep
it
for
expenses
and
that
i
would
bet
him
against
his
stud
and
ring
up
they
went
and
i
put
up
over
went
the
marked
card
and
he
lost
again
out
he
went
and
when
i
saw
him
again
the
captain
was
with
him
i
knew
what
was
in
the
wind
and
i
stood
my
ground
the
captain
said
to
me
have
you
been
gambling
on
my
boat
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
that
question
says
i
you
do
well
i
will
tell
you
my
boy
you
give
this
gentleman
back
all
the
money
and
jewelry
you
won
from
him
or
i
will
have
my
men
take
it
from
you
and
then
land
you
on
the
bank
i
laughed
at
him
and
told
him
to
bring
up
his
whole
crew
and
i
would
suffer
the
death
of
john
rodgers
before
i
would
give
up
one
cent
he
ordered
up
the
mate
and
crew
i
backed
up
against
the
side
of
the
boat
and
told
them
to
call
for
cards
as
i
stood
pat
they
said
they
did
not
want
any
for
they
could
see
by
my
looks
i
had
the
best
hand
or
at
least
i
would
play
it
for
all
it
was
worth
the
captain
then
said
you
must
go
ashore
i
said
land
her
both
sides
of
the
river
are
in
america
and
that
big
brick
house
up
there
is
where
i
live
the
old
fellow
could
not
help
laughing
at
my
cheek
and
so
concluded
to
let
me
alone
i
have
often
had
steamboat
captains
tell
me
i
must
give
up
the
money
or
go
ashore
and
i
had
them
to
tell
the
suckers
to
go
and
get
more
money
and
try
it
again
i
have
also
had
them
to
say
they
would
put
the
suckers
ashore
and
that
would
break
them
all
up
a
sucker
thinks
when
he
sees
a
mark
on
a
card
that
he
is
robbing
the
gambler
and
he
is
just
as
much
of
a
robber
and
gambler
as
the
other
man
when
two
persons
bet
one
lose
and
there
is
no
law
in
this
country
to
compel
a
man
to
bet
his
money
or
jewelry
on
anything
so
my
advice
is
do
you
do
it
a
cold
deck
i
was
aboard
the
bound
for
louisville
and
got
into
a
game
of
poker
when
we
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
cumberland
two
of
our
party
got
off
to
take
a
boat
for
nashville
that
left
our
game
for
fear
that
another
would
get
away
i
thought
i
must
get
my
work
in
without
further
delay
so
i
excused
myself
for
a
few
moments
and
went
to
the
bar
i
got
a
deck
just
like
the
one
we
were
using
and
run
up
three
hands
giving
one
three
aces
one
three
kings
and
myself
four
trays
we
played
a
short
time
after
my
return
and
on
my
deal
i
called
their
attention
to
something
and
at
the
same
time
came
up
with
the
cold
deck
the
betting
was
lively
i
let
them
do
the
raising
and
i
did
the
calling
until
it
came
to
the
draw
they
each
took
two
cards
and
i
took
one
saying
if
i
fill
this
flush
i
will
make
you
squeal
i
knew
they
both
had
full
hands
and
they
just
slashed
their
money
on
the
table
until
there
was
over
up
then
i
made
a
raise
of
and
they
both
called
gentlemen
i
said
i
suppose
you
have
me
beat
i
have
only
two
pair
oh
says
one
i
have
a
king
full
and
the
other
one
said
i
have
an
ace
full
well
boys
i
can
down
both
hands
for
i
have
two
pair
of
trays
the
game
came
to
a
close
for
there
was
no
more
money
on
the
other
side
caught
a
sleeper
i
was
playing
poker
once
on
the
steamer
the
party
were
all
full
of
grape
juice
along
about
morning
the
game
was
reduced
to
and
that
man
i
was
playing
with
was
fast
asleep
so
i
picked
up
the
deck
and
took
four
aces
and
four
kings
out
with
an
odd
card
to
each
i
gave
him
the
kings
and
i
took
the
aces
i
gave
him
a
hunch
and
told
him
to
wake
up
and
look
at
his
hand
he
partly
raised
his
hand
but
laid
it
down
again
and
i
knew
he
had
not
seen
it
i
gave
him
a
push
and
shook
him
up
pretty
lively
and
he
opened
his
eyes
i
said
come
look
at
your
hand
or
i
will
quit
he
got
a
glimpse
of
it
and
i
never
saw
such
a
change
in
a
man
countenance
he
made
a
dive
for
his
money
and
said
i
will
bet
you
for
i
want
to
show
you
i
am
not
asleep
i
told
him
i
thought
he
was
bluffing
i
said
in
a
joking
way
i
will
raise
you
so
he
pulled
out
all
his
money
and
laid
it
on
the
table
and
said
i
will
only
call
you
but
i
know
i
have
you
beat
i
showed
down
four
big
live
aces
and
he
was
awake
sure
enough
after
that
he
never
went
into
any
more
of
those
fits
and
we
played
until
they
wanted
the
table
for
breakfast
i
used
to
make
it
a
point
to
cold
deck
a
sucker
on
his
own
deal
as
they
then
had
great
confidence
in
their
hands
my
old
paw
is
large
enough
to
hold
out
a
compressed
bale
of
cotton
or
a
whole
deck
of
cards
and
it
comes
in
very
handy
to
do
the
work
i
could
hold
one
deck
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
and
shuffle
up
another
and
then
come
the
change
on
his
deal
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
cheek
and
gall
and
i
was
always
endowed
with
both
that
is
they
used
to
say
so
down
south
ten
thousand
in
counterfeit
money
we
had
a
great
graft
before
the
war
on
the
upper
mississippi
between
louis
and
charles
we
would
go
up
on
a
boat
and
back
by
rail
one
night
going
up
we
had
done
a
good
business
in
our
line
and
were
just
putting
up
the
shutters
when
a
man
stepped
up
and
said
he
could
turn
the
right
card
my
partner
posey
jeffers
was
doing
the
honors
that
night
and
he
said
i
will
bet
from
to
that
no
man
can
pick
out
the
winning
ticket
the
man
pulled
out
a
roll
nearly
as
large
as
a
pillow
and
put
up
posey
put
up
the
same
amount
and
over
the
card
went
for
but
it
was
not
the
winner
mix
them
up
again
said
the
man
and
he
put
up
the
same
sum
as
before
he
turned
and
posey
put
the
second
in
his
pocket
the
man
then
went
away
as
if
to
lose
was
an
thing
with
him
we
then
closed
up
our
banking
house
well
pleased
with
ourselves
the
next
day
we
were
counting
our
cash
and
we
found
we
had
on
hand
in
nice
new
bills
on
the
state
bank
of
missouri
but
it
was
counterfeit
we
deposited
it
in
the
fire
bank
as
we
had
no
immediate
use
for
it
blowing
up
of
the
princess
i
was
on
board
of
the
steamer
on
a
down
trip
when
she
was
carrying
a
large
number
of
passengers
and
there
were
fourteen
preachers
among
them
on
their
way
to
new
orleans
to
attend
a
conference
the
boat
was
making
the
fastest
time
she
had
ever
made
i
had
a
big
game
of
roulette
in
the
barber
shop
which
ran
all
saturday
night
and
on
sunday
morning
just
after
leaving
baton
rouge
i
opened
up
again
and
had
persons
in
the
shop
all
putting
down
their
money
as
fast
as
they
could
get
up
to
the
table
i
was
doing
a
business
when
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
terrific
noise
followed
by
the
hissing
of
escaping
steam
mingled
with
the
screams
and
groans
of
the
wounded
and
dying
the
boat
had
blown
up
and
was
almost
a
total
wreck
there
was
but
very
little
left
and
that
consisted
mostly
of
the
barber
shop
which
was
at
the
time
full
of
gamblers
and
not
one
of
them
was
hurt
the
steamers
and
came
to
our
aid
one
boat
looked
after
the
dead
and
wounded
and
the
other
took
us
lucky
fellows
out
of
the
barber
shop
one
hundred
souls
were
landed
into
eternity
without
a
moment
warning
and
among
them
were
the
fourteen
preachers
it
was
a
horrible
sight
the
bodies
were
so
mangled
and
scalded
that
one
could
not
have
recognized
his
own
brother
or
sister
captain
william
campbell
now
of
the
vicksburg
packet
line
was
steward
of
the
at
the
time
of
the
explosion
and
there
was
not
a
man
on
the
boat
that
worked
harder
to
save
life
and
relieve
the
wounded
he
richly
deserved
his
promotion
and
is
now
one
of
the
best
captains
on
the
river
a
woman
with
a
gun
i
was
on
a
boat
coming
from
memphis
one
night
when
my
partner
beat
a
man
out
of
playing
poker
after
the
game
broke
up
the
man
went
into
the
ladies
cabin
and
told
his
wife
she
ran
into
his
room
and
got
his
pistol
and
said
i
will
have
that
money
back
or
kill
the
man
i
saw
her
coming
pistol
in
hand
and
stepped
up
to
the
bar
and
told
the
barkeeper
to
hand
me
that
old
gun
he
had
in
the
drawer
which
i
knew
had
no
loads
in
it
she
came
on
frothing
at
the
mouth
with
blood
in
her
eyes
i
saw
she
was
very
much
excited
and
i
said
to
her
madame
you
are
perfectly
right
you
would
do
right
in
shooting
that
fellow
for
he
is
nothing
but
a
gambler
i
do
believe
your
pistol
will
go
off
you
had
better
take
my
pistol
for
i
am
a
government
detective
and
have
to
keep
the
best
of
arms
so
i
handed
her
the
pistol
and
took
hers
just
a
moment
later
out
stepped
the
man
who
had
won
the
money
and
she
bolted
up
to
him
and
said
you
won
my
husband
money
and
i
will
just
give
you
one
minute
to
hand
it
to
me
or
i
will
blow
your
brains
out
in
this
cabin
well
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
passengers
getting
out
of
the
cabin
when
she
pulled
down
on
him
but
he
knew
the
joke
and
stood
pat
and
showed
what
a
game
fellow
he
was
he
told
the
woman
her
husband
lost
the
money
gambling
and
he
could
not
get
a
cent
back
then
she
let
go
but
the
pistol
failed
to
go
off
and
he
got
her
to
go
back
into
the
cabin
and
pacified
her
by
giving
her
after
taking
the
charge
out
of
her
pistol
i
returned
it
to
her
so
reader
you
can
see
what
a
gay
life
there
is
in
gambling
the
frenchman
and
the
horse
hair
i
knew
a
frenchman
who
used
to
travel
the
river
playing
the
wheel
who
made
a
great
deal
of
money
and
sent
it
to
france
one
night
he
opened
a
snap
at
faro
and
i
was
to
loan
him
my
tools
he
shuffled
his
own
cards
as
he
was
too
smart
to
use
any
other
and
i
went
down
on
deck
and
pulled
some
hairs
out
of
a
tail
and
came
back
and
got
one
of
the
coppers
and
fastened
a
hair
to
it
a
copper
is
used
to
make
a
bet
lose
and
take
the
side
when
the
copper
is
off
the
bet
is
open
so
i
got
my
partner
to
buy
a
big
lot
of
white
checks
so
that
i
could
get
my
small
bet
behind
them
my
checks
were
apiece
he
was
playing
white
checks
at
cents
we
took
one
corner
of
the
table
side
by
side
he
placed
his
checks
between
the
dealer
and
me
then
i
would
put
my
little
stack
behind
his
checks
and
when
the
dealer
made
a
turn
he
would
have
to
rise
from
his
seat
to
see
if
my
bet
was
coppered
or
not
if
the
card
lost
that
we
were
on
i
would
let
the
copper
remain
if
it
on
i
gave
the
horse
hair
a
little
jerk
and
pulled
the
copper
off
and
we
both
won
i
used
to
take
it
off
when
he
was
going
to
pay
the
bet
for
fear
he
would
get
his
fingers
tangled
in
the
hair
and
in
this
way
we
won
the
bank
roll
which
made
the
frenchman
very
sick
saved
my
partner
life
we
were
once
coming
down
on
the
steamer
of
louisville
and
my
partner
was
doing
the
playing
that
day
we
had
won
some
big
money
and
were
about
to
quit
when
up
stepped
a
very
tall
man
who
looked
pale
and
sickly
he
watched
the
game
for
some
time
and
then
pulled
out
a
note
and
laid
it
on
the
card
he
wanted
and
of
course
he
lost
he
did
not
say
a
word
but
started
back
to
this
room
i
thought
he
acted
strange
and
i
concluded
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
pretty
soon
out
he
came
with
an
overcoat
on
his
arm
and
he
walked
up
as
near
the
table
as
he
could
get
and
commenced
to
push
one
of
the
crowd
away
so
as
to
get
closer
finally
he
got
at
my
partner
back
with
me
close
at
his
heels
when
he
commenced
to
pull
from
under
his
coat
a
large
colt
pistol
as
he
leveled
it
to
shoot
him
in
the
back
of
the
head
i
knocked
him
stiff
and
the
gun
dropped
on
the
floor
it
was
cocked
but
it
did
not
go
off
they
carried
the
man
back
to
his
room
put
cold
water
on
him
and
finally
brought
him
to
he
sent
for
me
and
went
i
went
back
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
said
friend
you
did
me
a
kindly
act
for
i
had
made
up
mind
to
kill
that
man
i
am
glad
it
happened
so
for
it
was
all
the
money
i
had
and
it
was
raised
by
my
friends
who
knowing
that
i
never
would
reach
home
again
were
sending
me
to
florida
as
all
the
doctors
have
given
me
up
and
i
thought
i
would
kill
him
as
i
do
not
expect
to
get
off
this
boat
alive
i
have
got
consumption
in
its
last
stages
so
i
pulled
out
counted
it
out
to
him
and
he
cried
like
a
child
his
pistol
i
gave
to
the
mate
as
i
thought
he
had
no
need
of
such
a
weapon
leap
for
life
another
time
i
was
coming
up
on
the
steamer
with
captain
fawcett
of
louisville
when
we
landed
at
napoleon
there
were
about
of
the
arkansas
killers
came
on
board
and
i
just
opened
out
and
cleaned
the
party
of
money
watches
and
all
their
valuables
things
went
along
smoothly
for
a
while
until
they
commenced
to
drink
pretty
freely
finally
one
of
them
said
jake
sam
ike
get
bill
and
let
us
kill
that
d
d
gambler
who
got
our
money
all
right
said
the
party
and
they
broke
for
their
rooms
to
get
their
guns
i
stepped
out
of
the
side
door
and
got
under
the
as
it
was
my
favorite
hiding
place
i
could
hear
every
word
down
stairs
and
could
whisper
to
the
pilot
well
they
hunted
the
boat
from
stem
to
stern
even
took
lights
and
went
down
into
the
hold
and
finally
gave
up
the
chase
as
one
man
said
i
had
jumped
overboard
i
slipped
the
pilot
in
gold
as
i
had
both
pockets
filled
with
gold
and
watches
and
told
him
at
the
first
point
that
stood
out
a
good
ways
to
run
her
as
close
as
he
could
and
i
would
jump
he
whispered
get
ready
and
i
slipped
out
and
walked
back
and
stood
on
the
top
of
the
house
until
she
came
as
i
thought
near
enough
to
jump
and
away
i
went
but
it
was
farther
than
i
expected
so
i
went
down
about
thirty
feet
into
the
river
and
struck
into
the
soft
mud
clear
up
to
my
waist
some
parties
who
were
standing
on
the
stern
of
the
boat
saw
me
and
gave
the
alarm
when
the
killers
all
rushed
back
and
commenced
firing
at
me
and
the
bullets
went
splashing
all
around
me
the
pilot
threw
her
into
the
bend
as
quick
as
he
could
and
then
let
on
she
took
a
sheer
on
him
and
nearly
went
to
the
other
side
the
shooting
brought
the
niggers
from
the
fields
to
the
bank
of
the
river
i
hallooed
to
them
to
get
a
long
pole
and
pull
me
out
for
i
was
stuck
in
the
mud
they
did
so
and
i
got
up
on
the
bank
and
waited
for
another
boat
i
was
always
very
stubborn
about
giving
up
money
if
any
one
wanted
to
compel
me
to
do
it
but
i
wish
i
had
of
what
i
have
given
back
to
people
that
did
need
it
i
have
seen
many
a
man
lose
all
he
had
and
then
go
back
into
the
ladies
cabin
and
get
his
wife
diamonds
and
lose
them
thinking
he
might
get
even
but
that
was
always
a
good
cap
for
me
for
i
would
walk
back
into
the
cabin
find
the
lady
and
hand
her
jewels
back
and
i
never
beat
a
man
out
of
his
money
that
i
did
not
find
out
from
the
clerk
if
his
passage
was
paid
if
not
i
would
pay
it
and
give
the
man
some
of
his
money
to
assist
him
to
his
destination
by
so
doing
i
was
looked
upon
as
being
a
pretty
good
robber
that
is
if
you
call
it
robbing
but
i
tell
you
that
a
man
that
will
bet
on
such
a
game
as
monte
is
a
bigger
robber
than
the
man
who
does
the
playing
for
he
thinks
he
is
robbing
you
and
you
know
you
are
robbing
him
the
chicken
men
and
their
silver
at
one
time
before
the
war
silver
was
such
a
drug
in
new
orleans
that
you
could
get
in
silver
for
in
state
bank
notes
but
the
commission
men
would
pay
it
out
to
the
hucksters
dollar
for
dollar
they
would
put
it
in
bags
and
label
it
with
the
name
and
the
amount
at
this
time
i
was
coming
out
on
the
steamer
and
in
looking
around
for
customers
i
found
fifteen
chicken
men
on
board
who
had
sold
their
coops
and
had
their
sacks
of
silver
setting
in
the
office
as
there
was
no
room
for
it
in
the
safe
after
supper
i
got
my
men
in
the
barber
shop
pulled
out
my
three
cards
and
began
to
throw
them
at
the
same
time
telling
the
men
i
had
lost
at
the
game
and
that
i
was
going
to
practice
until
i
could
throw
equal
to
the
man
that
had
beat
me
out
of
my
money
they
all
took
a
great
interest
in
the
game
and
could
turn
the
right
card
every
time
for
fun
about
this
time
the
capper
came
up
and
said
he
was
positive
he
could
guess
the
card
and
kept
insisting
on
betting
me
so
at
last
i
concluded
to
bet
him
and
he
lost
the
then
the
fun
commenced
one
of
the
chicken
men
saw
the
corner
of
the
right
card
turned
up
so
he
jumped
up
and
wanted
to
bet
me
that
he
could
pick
out
the
right
card
i
told
him
i
did
not
want
to
bet
but
if
he
made
it
i
would
bet
him
and
if
i
lost
i
would
quit
at
the
same
time
i
pulled
out
a
large
roll
of
small
bills
with
a
hundred
dollar
bill
on
the
outside
and
laid
it
on
the
table
the
chicken
men
held
a
council
of
war
and
of
course
they
all
saw
the
corner
of
the
right
card
turned
up
they
went
for
their
sacks
of
silver
and
planked
down
four
of
them
with
in
each
i
put
up
and
said
gentlemen
you
must
all
agree
on
one
card
and
select
one
man
to
turn
it
as
i
must
have
the
two
chances
they
picked
out
their
man
he
turned
the
card
with
the
corner
turned
up
but
of
course
it
was
not
the
right
card
the
boat
was
just
landing
to
take
in
sugar
so
i
said
gentlemen
i
will
have
to
bid
you
by
as
this
is
my
sugar
plantation
i
called
two
of
the
porters
and
told
them
to
take
my
sacks
ashore
they
said
all
right
massa
george
you
should
have
seen
the
chicken
men
look
at
me
when
i
landed
with
my
sacks
and
all
the
niggers
came
to
shake
hands
and
say
glad
youse
back
massa
george
for
i
knew
all
the
niggers
on
the
coast
after
the
boat
pulled
out
i
opened
one
of
the
sacks
and
gave
each
black
one
of
the
chicken
dollars
they
guarded
the
money
until
another
boat
came
down
which
they
hailed
and
i
was
soon
on
my
way
back
to
new
orleans
to
catch
some
more
suckers
the
hungry
man
i
was
on
board
the
coming
out
of
new
orleans
one
night
i
had
a
very
lively
game
of
red
and
black
and
did
not
close
up
until
two
in
the
morning
we
were
sitting
around
the
stove
in
the
bar
drinking
smoking
and
telling
stories
when
there
was
a
man
came
in
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
the
boat
left
new
orleans
when
he
came
aboard
he
was
pretty
full
of
and
had
been
asleep
when
he
woke
up
of
course
he
was
dry
and
had
come
into
the
bar
to
get
a
drink
i
said
to
him
you
look
dry
and
you
are
just
in
time
to
join
us
after
thanking
me
he
took
a
drink
and
then
told
me
he
had
missed
his
supper
i
told
him
i
would
send
the
porter
into
the
texas
and
get
him
a
lunch
which
i
did
i
then
thought
if
i
can
get
some
more
of
that
whisky
into
him
i
can
size
him
up
so
after
taking
another
round
i
said
to
him
you
should
have
been
up
when
the
big
betting
was
going
on
he
said
what
was
it
i
said
there
was
a
great
tall
fellow
sat
down
to
the
table
just
after
supper
and
called
all
the
men
in
the
cabin
to
come
and
see
how
he
had
lost
of
his
father
money
he
pulled
out
a
lot
of
cards
and
began
to
throw
them
on
the
table
and
said
to
us
you
see
the
same
fellow
who
got
my
money
do
you
bet
with
him
for
he
has
two
chances
to
his
one
i
ca
explain
just
how
he
did
it
for
i
have
got
any
of
the
cards
the
barkeeper
then
said
i
have
some
of
the
fellow
cards
that
he
left
when
he
got
off
the
boat
i
said
let
me
have
them
and
i
will
try
and
show
the
game
i
took
the
cards
and
bent
them
and
then
said
you
ought
to
have
seen
him
throw
them
through
those
long
fingers
it
would
have
made
you
laugh
i
was
throwing
and
explaining
when
my
partner
came
in
after
looking
on
for
a
little
while
he
asked
me
if
i
would
bet
on
the
game
i
pretended
not
to
hear
him
but
invited
them
both
to
take
a
drink
then
my
partner
offered
to
bet
the
drinks
i
took
him
up
and
he
lost
while
we
were
talking
he
picked
up
the
cards
and
turned
up
one
of
the
corners
of
the
winner
and
then
let
the
other
man
see
what
he
had
done
i
commenced
to
throw
them
again
when
my
partner
wanted
to
know
if
i
would
bet
just
as
they
lay
i
said
i
would
after
the
shuffle
he
said
you
beat
me
out
of
the
drinks
now
i
will
bet
you
i
can
pick
up
the
card
the
first
pick
enough
says
i
and
up
went
the
money
in
the
hungry
man
hands
over
went
the
card
and
my
partner
caught
me
for
i
said
give
him
the
money
as
he
won
it
fairly
the
stakeholder
threw
down
his
bread
and
meat
jumped
up
pulled
out
his
money
and
said
i
will
bet
you
i
can
turn
the
right
card
the
first
time
i
saw
he
had
about
or
so
i
said
i
will
make
but
one
bet
and
then
quit
i
will
bet
you
enough
said
go
you
the
money
was
put
up
and
over
went
the
card
but
as
luck
would
have
it
he
turned
the
wrong
one
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
glad
of
it
he
then
pulled
out
in
gold
and
wanted
to
bet
that
but
i
told
him
to
keep
it
for
i
did
not
want
to
win
it
from
him
but
wanted
to
keep
what
i
had
we
sat
down
and
had
a
drink
and
in
a
short
time
the
man
went
out
on
the
guards
my
partner
and
i
were
talking
and
laughing
about
how
we
won
the
money
when
all
of
a
sudden
in
rushed
the
man
with
his
clothes
all
torn
and
very
much
excited
we
asked
him
what
had
happened
when
he
told
us
that
two
fellows
had
grabbed
and
robbed
him
of
the
in
gold
we
got
the
mate
and
watchman
and
searched
the
boat
until
we
found
one
of
the
robbers
in
a
fireman
bunk
down
on
the
lower
deck
we
got
all
the
money
from
him
and
returned
it
to
the
man
the
other
robber
could
not
be
found
we
turned
the
one
we
had
captured
over
to
the
police
of
baton
rouge
and
that
was
the
last
we
ever
heard
of
him
i
took
the
next
boat
back
to
new
orleans
collared
the
wrong
man
i
had
been
attending
to
business
pretty
faithfully
and
had
accumulated
some
wealth
when
it
struck
me
i
must
take
a
rest
so
when
i
arrived
in
new
orleans
i
laid
off
i
was
playing
the
bank
one
night
and
was
a
big
loser
there
was
a
big
fighter
came
in
and
sat
down
at
the
same
table
and
in
a
short
time
he
began
to
pick
up
checks
i
thought
he
would
take
some
of
mine
next
and
i
was
not
in
the
humor
to
let
any
one
take
my
checks
sure
enough
he
clinched
onto
a
stack
i
had
on
the
nine
i
said
to
him
those
are
my
fifty
he
raised
up
took
me
by
the
collar
and
said
you
a
d
d
liar
i
thought
i
would
get
the
old
head
ready
for
business
once
more
so
i
argued
the
question
with
him
until
i
saw
an
opening
and
then
i
let
him
have
it
just
between
the
eyes
he
dropped
all
in
a
heap
and
it
was
some
time
before
they
could
get
him
to
sit
up
he
was
pretty
badly
hurt
his
nose
was
broken
down
flat
with
his
face
the
blood
was
running
out
of
his
ears
and
i
thought
it
was
about
time
for
me
to
get
out
i
cashed
in
my
checks
and
quit
the
game
over
a
loser
so
you
see
a
man
must
fight
at
times
even
when
he
has
quit
his
regular
business
and
is
laying
off
for
a
rest
my
jew
partner
i
was
on
board
the
steamer
one
evening
coming
up
from
new
orleans
when
a
jew
came
up
to
me
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
said
devol
i
have
heard
of
you
for
years
and
have
sat
at
the
same
table
with
you
in
new
orleans
playing
the
bank
i
caught
her
this
trip
for
over
but
i
have
often
wished
i
could
make
as
much
money
as
you
do
you
bet
i
would
take
better
care
of
it
than
you
come
let
us
go
and
have
a
nice
drink
i
told
him
i
did
not
drink
anything
but
wine
and
i
was
very
glad
he
had
beat
the
bank
for
they
nearly
always
beat
me
but
i
could
hold
my
own
with
any
man
at
poker
he
said
oh
devol
i
know
that
no
one
can
beat
you
at
poker
and
i
would
like
to
put
my
money
in
with
you
and
have
an
interest
something
struck
me
immediately
that
i
might
as
well
have
the
as
not
so
i
said
to
him
i
will
see
bush
my
partner
and
let
you
know
after
supper
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
manufacture
a
sucker
to
play
me
a
big
game
of
poker
i
knew
several
good
boys
on
board
some
were
gamblers
and
some
were
horsemen
i
selected
one
of
the
horsemen
and
took
him
to
my
room
to
teach
him
the
ropes
i
said
to
him
i
will
cold
deck
you
and
give
you
three
kings
a
seven
and
a
eight
and
you
must
put
your
thumb
over
one
of
the
spots
on
the
eight
so
that
the
jew
will
think
you
have
a
king
full
on
sevens
when
he
sees
your
hand
i
will
have
an
ace
full
and
will
bet
you
or
before
the
draw
then
you
raise
me
after
giving
him
full
instructions
so
there
would
be
no
mistake
i
gave
him
a
big
roll
and
let
him
out
with
instructions
not
to
know
me
until
the
time
of
the
game
i
told
bush
the
plan
so
after
supper
we
opened
up
with
our
three
cards
and
took
in
a
few
hundred
dollars
after
we
had
closed
for
the
evening
i
picked
up
my
manufactured
sucker
and
commenced
a
divvy
game
of
poker
i
told
my
jew
partner
to
see
every
hand
that
the
other
fellow
held
and
to
attract
his
attention
so
i
could
cold
deck
him
i
came
up
with
the
ice
and
bet
before
the
draw
the
sucker
came
back
and
raised
me
the
jew
was
behind
him
and
saw
his
king
full
on
sevens
he
then
came
around
and
saw
my
ace
full
on
trays
i
pretended
to
be
a
little
short
and
called
for
bush
to
bring
me
some
money
then
my
partner
commenced
to
get
out
his
money
and
was
in
such
a
hurry
for
fear
he
would
not
be
in
time
that
he
tore
the
buttons
off
his
vest
he
put
up
his
bush
got
from
john
heenan
the
prize
fighter
who
was
on
the
boat
and
i
called
the
bet
the
game
had
attracted
the
attention
of
all
the
passengers
they
were
all
around
us
some
on
the
tables
and
chairs
and
every
one
was
holding
his
breath
waiting
for
the
result
except
my
jew
partner
who
was
so
delighted
with
the
sure
thing
of
having
won
of
the
money
that
he
could
not
keep
still
a
moment
but
kept
dancing
around
rubbing
his
hands
and
smiling
as
if
he
had
sold
a
suit
of
clothes
without
coming
down
a
cent
when
to
everybody
great
surprise
the
sucker
said
gentlemen
i
have
made
a
mistake
in
my
hand
ca
i
take
my
money
down
the
jew
said
oh
we
do
rectify
no
mistakes
in
poker
the
sucker
looked
up
at
him
and
said
what
in
the
h
l
have
you
got
to
do
with
this
game
the
jew
said
i
thought
you
was
bluffin
the
sucker
then
said
hold
on
gentlemen
we
have
not
drawn
yet
i
thought
i
had
a
king
full
on
sevens
he
then
threw
down
the
seven
and
eight
and
called
for
two
cards
the
jew
said
we
care
for
your
mistake
and
then
walked
around
behind
the
sucker
to
see
what
he
would
get
in
the
draw
i
dealt
him
off
two
cards
but
the
jew
did
not
get
to
see
what
he
got
they
had
sent
me
some
money
from
the
office
and
i
bet
him
the
sucker
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
bet
i
put
up
all
the
money
i
had
my
big
single
stone
pin
and
ring
but
that
was
not
enough
then
the
jew
put
up
his
juergunsen
watch
a
large
cluster
pin
and
ring
and
called
the
bet
the
sucker
said
i
have
two
pair
the
jew
was
so
glad
thinking
i
had
won
that
he
could
not
keep
still
but
went
up
and
down
like
a
i
showed
down
my
ace
full
and
then
the
sucker
showed
down
two
pair
of
kings
you
should
have
seen
my
new
partner
he
threw
up
both
his
hands
groaned
and
fell
over
on
the
floor
dead
we
had
to
throw
water
in
his
face
to
bring
him
around
and
when
we
got
him
up
he
started
for
the
guards
saying
i
go
drown
myself
i
do
want
to
live
some
one
ran
and
got
him
a
life
preserver
and
told
him
to
put
it
on
before
he
jumped
overboard
he
finally
quieted
down
and
went
to
his
room
i
took
the
horseman
into
my
room
gave
him
in
money
and
my
partner
diamonds
he
was
the
lion
of
the
boat
and
did
not
have
to
pay
for
drinks
from
there
to
louisville
i
got
off
at
baton
rouge
at
daybreak
and
was
soon
on
my
way
back
to
new
orleans
and
when
i
arrived
there
every
one
i
met
would
ask
me
about
my
bad
luck
my
friends
were
sorry
for
me
i
could
have
borrowed
almost
any
amount
of
money
the
papers
came
out
all
over
the
country
that
devol
had
at
last
found
his
match
i
saw
the
jew
in
louis
some
years
later
he
knew
me
and
said
devol
come
and
let
us
get
a
good
drink
see
that
clothing
store
that
mine
i
never
play
poker
since
that
time
on
the
boat
do
you
remember
sold
out
by
a
partner
one
night
i
was
coming
up
the
river
on
the
steamer
i
had
a
partner
with
me
named
charles
bush
he
was
a
good
hearted
fellow
but
did
not
know
much
about
beating
a
sucker
out
of
his
money
i
had
to
teach
him
how
to
handle
the
blokes
well
bush
and
myself
had
made
some
money
and
were
sitting
around
looking
at
the
gamblers
there
were
of
them
on
board
going
to
the
memphis
races
finally
one
of
the
sports
named
dennis
mccarthy
said
to
me
devol
i
will
play
you
for
a
game
so
i
turned
to
bush
and
asked
him
if
he
wanted
any
interest
in
it
he
said
no
so
he
sat
down
alongside
of
me
where
he
could
see
my
hand
we
commenced
to
play
i
could
see
bush
working
a
toothpick
in
his
mouth
from
the
corner
to
the
middle
and
then
over
to
the
other
side
i
thought
i
noticed
when
the
toothpick
was
in
the
left
side
of
his
mouth
i
always
had
one
trump
when
he
had
it
in
the
middle
of
his
mouth
i
had
two
trumps
when
in
the
right
side
i
had
no
trumps
mccarthy
beat
me
six
straight
games
the
last
game
we
played
we
were
six
and
six
i
saw
bush
take
the
toothpick
out
of
his
mouth
i
looked
at
my
hand
and
saw
no
trumps
mccarthy
stood
his
hand
and
led
he
had
no
trumps
either
but
as
he
had
some
large
cards
in
his
hand
he
made
the
game
which
put
him
out
bush
was
sitting
on
my
right
so
i
let
go
with
my
left
caught
him
between
the
eyes
and
straightened
him
out
on
the
floor
they
got
a
piece
of
beefsteak
and
put
it
on
his
eyes
and
he
went
to
bed
there
was
a
big
fellow
named
anderson
who
said
that
any
man
that
would
hit
another
for
nothing
was
a
scoundrel
and
he
could
whip
him
he
was
not
posted
and
did
not
know
why
i
hit
him
so
he
made
this
bluff
i
said
to
him
take
off
your
coat
and
come
and
see
me
he
took
off
his
coat
and
after
he
got
it
off
he
weakened
and
picked
up
a
big
iron
poker
that
lay
by
the
stove
i
pulled
out
old
betsy
jane
one
of
the
best
tarantula
pistols
in
the
southern
country
and
told
him
to
drop
the
poker
which
he
did
now
said
i
if
you
want
it
on
the
square
i
am
your
man
so
at
it
we
went
and
i
hit
him
and
knocked
him
clear
through
the
office
door
i
then
reached
down
and
caught
him
by
the
collar
raised
him
up
and
struck
him
with
that
good
old
faithful
head
of
mine
and
the
fight
was
all
over
for
i
had
broken
every
bone
in
his
nose
the
clerks
came
rushing
out
of
the
office
the
captain
and
passengers
also
came
and
the
captain
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
i
told
him
and
the
mate
spoke
up
and
said
devol
was
perfectly
right
for
he
had
seen
it
all
i
offered
to
pay
for
the
door
and
chairs
we
broke
but
the
captain
would
not
accept
one
cent
i
went
back
to
the
room
to
see
bush
for
i
was
sorry
i
had
hit
him
although
i
thought
he
was
guilty
i
told
him
to
get
up
and
look
out
for
me
and
i
would
open
faro
bank
for
the
gamblers
which
he
did
they
all
changed
in
except
the
big
fellow
with
the
broken
nose
he
went
to
bed
the
result
was
we
broke
every
one
of
them
and
then
got
off
at
baton
rouge
they
went
to
memphis
where
the
races
commenced
in
a
few
days
bush
was
with
me
for
three
years
after
that
and
many
a
night
i
have
sat
and
dealt
for
a
big
game
and
in
the
morning
would
divide
several
hundred
dollars
with
bush
who
was
in
bed
and
asleep
the
big
catfish
my
old
partner
bush
and
i
had
been
up
all
night
in
new
orleans
playing
faro
and
we
were
several
hundred
dollars
winners
and
thought
we
would
walk
down
to
the
french
market
and
get
a
cup
of
coffee
before
we
went
to
bed
we
saw
a
catfish
that
would
weigh
about
pounds
its
mouth
was
so
large
that
i
could
put
my
head
into
it
we
got
stuck
on
the
big
cat
and
while
we
were
looking
at
it
an
old
man
came
up
to
me
and
said
that
is
the
largest
catfish
i
ever
saw
bush
was
a
little
way
off
from
me
just
at
the
time
and
knowing
i
would
have
some
fun
if
not
a
bet
with
the
old
man
he
kept
out
of
the
way
i
said
to
the
old
gent
you
are
the
worst
judge
of
a
fish
i
ever
saw
that
is
not
a
cat
it
is
a
pike
and
the
largest
one
ever
brought
to
this
market
he
looked
at
me
and
then
at
the
fish
and
then
said
look
here
my
boy
where
in
the
d
were
you
raised
i
told
him
i
was
born
and
raised
in
indiana
well
i
thought
you
were
from
some
state
we
got
to
arguing
about
it
and
i
appeared
to
be
mad
and
offered
to
bet
him
that
the
fish
was
a
pike
says
he
do
you
mean
it
i
pulled
out
a
roll
threw
down
and
told
him
to
cover
it
he
lammed
her
up
and
i
said
who
will
we
leave
it
to
we
looked
around
and
saw
bush
with
a
memorandum
book
in
his
hand
and
a
pen
behind
his
ear
talking
to
a
woman
who
sold
vegetables
and
he
was
acting
as
if
he
was
collector
of
the
market
i
said
may
be
that
man
with
the
book
in
his
hand
might
know
the
old
fellow
called
bush
and
said
to
him
do
you
belong
about
here
oh
yes
i
have
belonged
about
here
for
a
good
many
years
says
bush
well
sir
you
are
just
the
man
we
want
to
decide
our
bet
says
the
old
gent
well
gentlemen
i
am
in
somewhat
of
a
hurry
but
if
you
do
detain
me
too
long
i
will
be
glad
to
serve
you
to
the
best
of
my
ability
said
bush
we
want
you
to
tell
us
what
kind
of
a
fish
this
is
well
gentlemen
that
can
be
done
easily
out
with
it
said
the
old
gent
bush
braced
himself
up
and
said
i
have
been
here
for
twenty
years
and
that
is
the
largest
i
ever
saw
in
this
market
well
well
well
says
the
old
man
i
have
lived
on
the
tombigbee
river
for
years
and
i
never
saw
two
bigger
fools
than
you
two
i
invited
the
old
man
and
the
to
join
me
in
a
cup
of
coffee
bush
accepted
but
the
old
one
from
the
tombigbee
declined
saying
he
did
not
drink
with
men
that
did
not
know
a
catfish
from
a
pike
we
bid
him
good
morning
and
went
home
and
we
were
both
sound
asleep
in
a
short
time
for
we
felt
we
had
did
an
honest
night
and
morning
work
the
sermon
on
the
mount
boat
the
hypocrite
had
left
his
mass
and
stood
in
naked
ugliness
he
was
a
man
who
stole
the
livery
of
the
court
of
heaven
to
serve
the
devil
in
i
was
coming
from
new
orleans
on
board
the
steamer
bound
for
louisville
she
was
literally
packed
with
people
after
supper
on
saturday
evening
we
started
a
game
in
the
barber
shop
which
was
kept
up
until
sunday
morning
over
changed
hands
and
i
was
a
big
winner
after
eating
my
breakfast
i
went
out
on
the
guards
to
take
a
smoke
before
going
to
bed
while
i
was
enjoying
my
cigar
a
fine
looking
old
gentleman
about
sixty
years
of
age
came
up
to
me
and
entered
into
conversation
presently
the
captain
joined
us
the
old
gentleman
said
he
was
a
minister
from
louisville
and
would
like
to
preach
in
the
cabin
the
captain
gave
his
consent
the
minister
placed
his
arm
in
mine
and
before
i
was
aware
of
what
we
were
doing
he
had
me
half
way
down
the
ladies
cabin
and
then
it
was
too
late
to
back
out
or
get
away
he
sat
me
down
near
where
he
was
standing
i
was
impressed
with
his
discourse
for
it
was
full
of
practical
sayings
he
spoke
of
gambling
in
very
plain
terms
and
of
the
game
that
had
been
kept
up
all
night
in
the
barber
shop
he
said
it
was
a
pity
that
such
a
fine
looking
gentleman
as
the
one
who
sat
near
him
should
play
cards
for
money
to
tell
the
truth
his
remarks
on
the
subject
of
my
business
did
make
me
feel
a
little
mean
he
did
not
look
directly
at
me
but
i
thought
he
was
getting
close
to
home
the
collection
amounted
to
considerable
and
i
chipped
in
my
share
liberally
after
the
morning
services
were
over
i
retired
to
my
room
to
take
a
sleep
and
it
was
not
long
until
i
had
forgotten
that
we
had
an
old
preacher
on
board
i
spent
that
sunday
evening
reading
until
near
midnight
most
of
the
passengers
had
retired
there
was
but
one
passenger
in
the
cabin
and
he
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
me
reading
i
approached
him
and
found
it
was
the
minister
i
had
changed
my
dress
so
that
he
did
not
recognize
me
i
sat
down
near
him
and
he
began
talking
about
the
gambling
game
of
the
night
before
and
he
handled
the
gamblers
without
gloves
i
sided
with
him
in
his
views
and
then
trumped
up
a
story
of
how
i
had
been
roped
into
the
game
and
had
lost
but
that
my
father
was
rich
and
gave
me
all
the
money
i
could
spend
and
that
i
did
not
mind
the
loss
very
much
he
became
very
much
interested
and
asked
a
great
many
questions
i
told
him
i
had
picked
up
some
of
the
tickets
that
they
played
the
game
with
and
had
them
in
my
room
and
if
he
would
like
to
see
them
i
would
go
and
get
them
oh
i
would
like
very
much
to
see
the
way
it
was
played
and
i
will
go
to
your
room
if
you
will
show
me
we
went
to
my
room
and
i
showed
him
the
old
monte
racket
i
let
him
play
with
the
cards
until
he
thought
he
knew
all
about
them
and
he
said
to
me
my
dear
sir
i
ca
see
how
you
could
lose
money
on
such
a
simple
thing
i
would
not
fail
to
pick
out
the
right
ticket
every
time
i
said
to
him
i
make
you
a
proposition
i
will
throw
the
tickets
and
put
up
with
you
if
you
gain
the
money
you
are
to
donate
it
to
your
church
and
if
i
get
it
i
will
do
the
same
for
i
want
to
show
you
how
i
lost
playing
them
the
old
fellow
accepted
my
proposition
for
he
wanted
to
give
the
money
to
his
church
and
so
did
i
of
course
i
displayed
a
big
roll
and
told
him
i
would
just
as
soon
make
it
as
he
agreed
and
we
put
up
he
turned
the
ticket
but
he
failed
to
pick
the
right
one
it
was
such
a
simple
thing
that
he
got
excited
and
put
down
more
and
again
he
failed
to
pick
out
the
right
one
we
kept
on
until
the
old
sucker
lost
an
even
then
i
said
to
him
i
am
really
sorry
for
i
had
rather
lost
the
amount
myself
this
money
will
do
me
no
good
and
it
would
hardly
benefit
your
church
we
have
had
lots
of
fun
and
i
want
you
to
gain
the
money
back
i
will
put
up
the
against
your
watch
and
chain
and
when
you
gain
it
back
we
can
have
a
big
laugh
over
it
he
put
up
his
handsome
watch
and
chain
that
had
been
presented
to
him
by
his
congregation
and
as
he
was
playing
in
hard
luck
i
soon
had
the
ticker
he
bade
me
good
night
and
went
to
his
room
i
went
to
see
the
captain
and
when
i
showed
him
the
reverend
gentleman
watch
with
the
inscriptions
on
it
he
could
hardly
believe
his
own
eyes
after
having
a
good
laugh
with
the
captain
i
went
to
the
minister
room
and
found
him
on
his
knees
when
he
saw
me
he
said
i
have
just
been
praying
for
you
i
replied
brother
had
you
do
a
little
of
that
for
yourself
oh
says
he
i
have
prayed
mostly
for
myself
this
night
well
i
said
since
you
have
prayed
for
yourself
and
me
too
here
is
your
watch
chain
and
and
sin
no
more
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
god
bless
you
i
left
the
boat
at
natchez
and
did
not
get
to
see
the
old
gentleman
again
i
caught
a
preacher
once
for
all
his
money
his
gold
spectacles
and
his
sermons
then
i
had
some
of
those
queer
feelings
come
over
me
and
when
they
came
upon
me
i
could
not
resist
their
influence
so
i
gave
him
his
sermons
and
specks
back
at
one
time
there
were
fifteen
preachers
on
the
jackson
road
going
to
a
conference
at
hazelhurst
i
got
in
among
them
and
just
for
fun
i
opened
up
monte
and
i
caught
five
out
of
the
fifteen
for
every
cent
they
had
i
tell
you
my
dear
readers
preachers
are
but
human
and
some
of
them
will
steal
the
livery
of
the
court
of
heaven
to
serve
the
devil
devol
in
fifty
to
the
barkeeper
i
was
in
the
charles
one
morning
having
been
up
all
night
playing
the
bank
when
a
good
looking
old
fellow
walked
in
and
called
for
a
champagne
cocktail
i
turned
to
him
and
said
have
one
with
me
i
drew
out
of
the
havana
lottery
last
evening
and
i
would
like
you
to
join
me
he
accepted
the
invitation
and
while
the
barkeeper
was
mixing
the
drinks
i
slipped
out
some
monte
cards
and
began
playing
them
on
the
counter
i
told
the
old
gentleman
it
was
a
kind
of
lottery
i
saw
a
man
play
and
i
wanted
to
learn
it
he
looked
at
the
game
and
turned
the
card
for
fun
then
for
the
drinks
and
cigars
finally
he
said
i
will
bet
you
dollars
i
can
turn
the
card
i
said
if
i
bet
it
will
not
be
less
than
he
got
out
his
wallet
and
there
was
plenty
of
money
in
sight
i
then
pretended
that
i
wanted
to
back
out
and
i
offered
to
treat
to
a
bottle
of
wine
he
said
no
sir
i
hold
you
to
the
bet
i
then
acted
a
little
huffy
as
he
thought
and
offered
to
bet
him
he
put
up
and
as
i
saw
some
left
i
said
here
is
more
and
i
will
bet
but
once
he
put
up
the
extra
i
said
to
him
you
know
you
must
turn
over
the
baby
card
the
first
time
or
you
lose
all
right
he
said
and
at
the
same
time
he
grabbed
a
card
as
though
he
thought
it
would
get
away
and
turned
it
over
but
it
was
not
the
baby
and
i
was
winner
and
did
not
have
to
divide
with
a
capper
as
i
played
the
old
sucker
i
invited
him
to
take
another
drink
and
then
bid
him
good
morning
as
i
was
going
out
i
rolled
up
a
bill
into
a
little
ball
and
shot
it
at
the
barkeeper
he
caught
it
on
the
fly
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
i
went
to
my
room
and
slept
until
evening
when
i
was
up
and
ready
for
the
bank
again
lost
his
wife
diamonds
i
was
playing
poker
with
a
gentleman
on
board
the
steamer
bound
for
louisville
late
one
night
and
had
won
a
few
hundred
dollars
from
him
when
he
got
up
without
saying
a
word
and
went
to
the
ladies
cabin
in
a
short
time
he
came
back
with
a
small
box
in
his
hand
and
said
to
me
come
let
us
finish
our
game
he
opened
the
box
and
i
saw
it
was
full
of
ladies
diamond
jewelry
i
said
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
those
said
he
i
will
put
them
up
as
money
oh
no
i
have
no
use
for
ladies
jewelry
well
says
he
if
i
lose
i
will
redeem
them
when
we
get
to
louisville
i
told
him
i
was
not
going
above
vicksburg
well
says
he
if
you
win
leave
them
with
the
clerk
and
i
will
pay
him
i
then
loaned
him
on
the
jewelry
and
we
sat
down
to
play
it
was
about
when
we
commenced
and
before
they
wanted
the
tables
for
breakfast
i
had
won
the
back
we
drank
a
champagne
cocktail
and
he
went
to
his
room
the
barber
was
at
work
on
me
so
that
i
was
a
little
late
for
breakfast
and
the
steward
had
to
take
me
into
the
cabin
to
get
me
a
seat
there
was
a
gentleman
a
very
beautiful
lady
and
a
sweet
little
child
at
the
same
table
the
lady
eyes
were
red
as
if
she
had
been
crying
i
looked
at
the
gentleman
and
saw
it
was
the
same
persons
who
had
lost
the
diamonds
somehow
my
breakfast
did
not
suit
me
and
the
more
i
looked
at
that
young
wife
and
mother
the
less
i
felt
like
eating
so
at
last
i
got
up
and
left
the
table
i
went
to
my
room
got
the
little
velvet
box
wrapped
it
up
and
carried
it
back
they
were
just
leaving
the
table
when
i
returned
i
called
the
chambermaid
and
told
her
the
lady
had
left
a
package
and
for
her
to
take
it
to
her
room
after
it
was
gone
i
felt
better
and
i
eat
a
square
meal
the
gentleman
came
and
thanked
me
and
wanted
my
address
but
as
i
never
had
any
one
to
send
me
money
lost
at
gambling
i
told
him
not
to
mind
the
address
for
i
knew
if
i
did
not
give
it
i
would
not
expect
anything
and
therefore
would
not
be
disappointed
the
monte
king
after
getting
well
of
the
fever
in
new
orleans
i
took
a
trip
up
the
river
on
one
of
the
vicksburg
packets
on
this
trip
i
met
a
man
by
the
name
of
rollins
who
was
the
first
man
i
ever
saw
playing
monte
seeing
i
was
pretty
smart
he
proposed
a
partnership
we
commenced
depredations
on
the
packets
he
did
the
playing
and
i
was
the
capper
i
represented
a
planter
son
traveling
for
my
health
the
first
party
that
we
fell
on
to
was
a
nigger
trader
who
had
big
black
coons
on
board
taking
them
to
new
orleans
to
sell
we
found
him
an
easy
victim
and
downed
him
for
and
four
of
his
niggers
we
were
afraid
to
win
any
more
from
him
on
account
of
a
squeal
but
he
acted
very
honorably
and
made
out
a
bill
of
sale
well
here
i
was
a
with
plenty
of
money
my
partner
was
one
of
the
best
that
i
ever
worked
with
except
canada
bill
whom
i
shall
speak
of
later
we
sold
our
slaves
at
one
of
the
yards
for
they
averaged
apiece
and
in
twenty
minutes
after
i
saw
one
of
them
put
on
the
block
and
bring
we
knocked
about
the
city
spending
our
money
freely
riding
to
the
lake
eating
big
suppers
with
the
girls
and
all
were
friends
for
we
would
not
allow
any
person
to
spend
a
cent
and
the
flowing
champagne
was
a
great
luxury
in
those
days
the
next
trip
we
took
was
on
a
red
river
packet
we
went
as
far
as
shreveport
and
back
on
the
same
boat
and
on
the
trip
clear
of
expenses
we
were
winners
as
it
was
no
more
trouble
to
win
then
than
now
well
the
gamblers
began
to
get
a
little
jealous
of
us
and
at
the
same
time
we
lost
heavily
at
their
games
when
we
played
as
we
were
both
good
suckers
at
any
game
except
our
own
one
night
one
of
them
struck
my
partner
and
i
jumped
in
between
and
told
them
i
did
all
the
fighting
for
both
and
at
it
we
went
and
the
result
was
i
did
him
up
for
i
always
kept
myself
in
good
condition
by
using
and
taking
other
exercise
when
i
was
years
old
i
did
not
think
there
was
a
man
in
the
world
that
could
whip
me
in
a
or
on
the
street
after
i
got
away
with
this
gambler
they
made
up
their
minds
that
they
would
get
a
man
who
would
make
me
squeal
we
continued
working
the
boats
and
making
plenty
of
money
and
every
time
we
got
out
in
the
city
both
of
us
would
lose
a
big
sum
of
money
and
then
perhaps
i
would
have
to
fight
for
they
were
looking
for
a
man
to
start
a
fuss
with
me
one
night
we
had
been
down
to
the
lake
and
had
a
big
supper
and
we
drove
up
opposite
the
charles
hotel
and
went
in
there
were
about
gamblers
standing
in
a
saloon
called
the
jewel
i
saw
at
a
glance
they
were
drinking
and
full
i
also
saw
two
of
my
men
that
i
had
whipped
previously
well
i
could
not
show
the
white
feather
so
i
called
for
a
basket
of
wine
and
invited
all
to
join
me
when
one
of
the
party
stepped
out
into
the
middle
of
the
room
took
off
his
coat
and
said
i
can
whip
any
man
in
the
room
i
looked
around
and
saw
it
was
a
job
to
either
kill
or
whip
me
i
saw
at
a
glance
i
had
only
one
friend
in
the
house
that
was
captain
smoker
of
the
vicksburg
packet
company
i
knew
he
could
be
of
no
service
to
me
the
door
was
locked
i
turned
to
the
challenger
and
said
i
know
who
you
mean
this
for
and
i
untied
my
cravat
i
had
a
single
stone
on
my
shirt
that
cost
me
i
took
off
my
coat
and
vest
and
handed
them
all
to
the
barkeeper
the
enemy
was
a
powerfully
built
man
six
feet
and
one
inch
high
and
weighed
pounds
more
than
myself
at
that
time
i
weighed
pounds
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
was
a
pretty
hard
fight
but
i
got
one
good
lick
at
him
with
my
head
and
that
won
the
battle
for
me
it
took
all
the
fight
out
of
him
he
said
that
will
do
the
doors
were
thrown
open
and
in
less
than
a
minute
there
were
people
in
there
we
were
both
arrested
and
taken
to
the
or
calaboose
where
we
gave
bail
captain
smoker
going
on
my
bond
while
they
were
signing
our
bonds
my
opponent
made
some
remark
that
i
did
not
like
and
i
hit
him
a
good
crack
in
the
neck
and
brought
him
down
on
his
knees
but
they
parted
us
and
the
next
day
when
we
appeared
in
court
the
judge
said
he
had
a
notion
to
fine
us
apiece
for
not
sending
for
him
as
he
wanted
to
see
it
himself
but
i
will
let
you
go
this
time
the
man
name
was
john
mortice
of
natchez
miss
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
pretty
well
used
up
but
i
staid
in
my
room
till
i
got
all
right
again
we
made
several
successful
trips
after
that
together
at
last
we
parted
and
he
went
to
california
and
soon
after
died
i
was
then
king
of
the
monte
men
and
did
all
of
the
playing
myself
i
got
a
man
named
charlie
clark
to
do
the
capping
for
me
and
we
made
a
world
of
money
eph
holland
alexander
and
i
were
coming
out
of
the
red
river
one
night
the
boat
was
full
of
people
and
a
great
many
were
playing
poker
it
was
when
a
large
and
powerful
man
rushed
out
of
the
ladies
cabin
with
nothing
on
but
his
and
with
a
large
in
his
hand
he
rushed
to
one
of
the
tables
where
there
were
seven
seated
and
before
they
could
rise
he
plunged
the
knife
up
to
the
hilt
in
two
of
the
men
i
jumped
up
and
ran
out
into
the
hall
determined
to
kill
him
if
he
made
a
break
for
me
but
the
captain
hallooed
at
me
do
shoot
he
is
a
crazy
man
he
had
been
brought
on
board
at
alexandria
by
his
wife
who
was
taking
him
to
an
asylum
he
came
rushing
through
the
cabin
towards
the
hall
and
i
snatched
up
a
big
iron
poker
for
i
made
up
my
mind
i
would
lay
him
out
if
he
came
within
reach
he
picked
out
another
man
and
started
for
him
and
they
had
it
all
around
the
guards
the
poor
fellow
that
he
was
after
was
almost
scared
to
death
i
jumped
inside
of
the
door
and
as
he
came
brandishing
his
knife
i
dealt
him
a
heavy
blow
on
the
side
of
the
head
which
brought
him
down
we
then
got
rope
and
tied
him
and
kept
him
in
that
position
till
the
engineer
made
for
him
the
daguerrotype
boat
good
heaven
that
sots
and
knaves
should
be
so
vain
to
wish
their
vile
remembrance
may
remain
and
stand
recorded
at
their
own
request
to
future
days
a
libel
or
a
jest
before
the
war
eph
holland
my
partner
alexander
and
myself
were
waiting
for
a
boat
at
the
mouth
of
the
red
river
there
was
a
little
boat
lying
at
the
landing
nicely
fitted
up
for
a
daguerrotype
gallery
and
i
proposed
to
the
boys
that
we
have
our
pictures
taken
all
together
and
i
would
pay
for
it
as
i
thought
it
would
make
a
pretty
group
they
agreed
so
we
went
on
board
the
boat
and
let
the
artist
take
us
all
in
a
bunch
holland
was
in
the
middle
and
the
picture
flattered
him
so
he
insisted
on
having
a
dozen
copies
i
saw
that
the
picture
did
not
do
me
justice
so
i
wanted
eph
to
sit
alone
telling
him
it
would
cost
less
he
said
he
would
pay
the
bill
for
he
could
see
it
was
the
contrast
that
showed
him
off
to
so
great
an
advantage
well
to
please
him
we
let
the
artist
draw
a
bead
on
us
eleven
times
more
for
at
that
time
they
could
only
take
one
picture
at
a
shot
holland
paid
the
entire
bill
which
was
so
large
that
i
asked
the
daguerrotype
man
if
he
would
sell
out
oh
no
i
am
making
too
much
money
says
he
then
i
thought
i
will
try
and
get
some
of
it
at
least
the
amount
that
poor
eph
had
paid
for
his
vanity
i
told
the
old
story
of
how
i
had
lost
my
money
and
began
to
throw
the
cards
i
soon
had
them
guessing
alexander
turned
up
the
corner
of
the
winner
and
then
bet
me
that
the
artist
could
turn
it
i
took
him
up
and
lost
the
money
the
artist
got
excited
and
wanted
to
bet
his
money
the
result
was
i
won
all
he
had
and
told
him
i
would
give
him
a
chance
to
get
even
and
would
bet
all
he
had
lost
against
his
boat
and
contents
he
accepted
the
proposition
holland
made
out
a
bill
of
sale
the
artist
signed
it
and
in
a
short
time
he
had
lost
his
home
and
business
then
i
said
to
him
you
have
played
in
bad
luck
so
i
will
pay
you
a
salary
to
manage
the
business
for
me
he
accepted
the
employment
we
bid
him
good
bye
and
took
a
boat
for
new
orleans
two
weeks
later
i
saw
my
picture
boat
at
bayou
sara
i
went
on
board
and
my
employee
was
glad
to
see
me
or
at
least
he
said
he
was
i
asked
him
about
the
business
and
he
told
me
he
was
losing
money
so
i
told
him
i
would
like
to
sell
out
he
wanted
to
know
my
price
i
told
him
he
offered
me
cash
and
his
note
for
the
balance
so
i
thought
as
he
had
been
losing
money
for
two
weeks
i
had
better
sell
i
have
his
note
yet
and
the
first
time
i
see
holland
i
am
going
to
try
and
sell
it
to
him
there
was
no
money
in
the
business
for
me
as
it
was
outside
of
my
line
and
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
a
man
should
stick
to
his
legitimate
business
eph
holland
was
sorry
afterward
that
he
ever
had
his
picture
taken
in
a
group
for
the
next
time
he
went
to
new
orleans
he
was
arrested
on
the
street
and
taken
to
the
chief
office
and
there
he
saw
his
group
picture
in
the
rogues
gallery
he
tried
to
explain
how
it
was
that
his
picture
came
to
be
grouped
with
two
unknown
but
the
chief
could
see
it
then
eph
sent
for
his
friends
who
went
on
his
bond
and
he
was
let
off
until
the
next
morning
as
he
and
his
friends
were
leaving
the
chief
office
he
caught
sight
of
me
and
then
he
dropped
and
said
to
me
george
gave
that
picture
to
the
chief
i
said
what
picture
then
eph
said
boys
come
on
it
all
on
me
the
chief
joined
us
and
when
eph
had
settled
the
bill
he
said
to
me
george
the
next
time
i
have
my
picture
taken
i
will
go
it
alone
i
said
to
him
eph
all
is
vanity
and
vexation
of
spirit
pittsburg
best
man
before
the
war
there
were
a
great
many
coal
boatmen
traveling
on
the
river
i
was
coming
up
at
that
time
with
captain
forsyth
on
the
steamer
some
of
the
coal
boat
crew
traveled
in
the
cabin
and
others
on
deck
i
got
into
a
game
with
one
of
their
bullies
they
said
he
was
the
best
man
in
pittsburg
in
the
play
i
bested
him
out
of
a
few
hundred
dollars
and
he
did
not
like
it
a
bit
he
went
down
on
deck
and
told
his
party
there
was
a
boy
up
stairs
who
had
won
all
his
money
if
he
comes
on
deck
i
will
let
you
know
and
we
will
throw
him
down
and
take
the
money
away
from
him
the
news
came
to
me
and
i
prepared
for
the
boys
by
putting
my
money
and
jewelry
in
the
office
took
my
pistol
and
went
down
on
deck
the
bully
was
there
he
pointed
me
out
to
the
gang
they
commenced
to
gather
around
me
i
backed
up
against
a
hogshead
of
sugar
telling
them
not
to
come
any
nearer
to
me
or
i
would
hurt
some
of
them
they
took
the
hint
but
began
to
abuse
me
the
mate
and
some
of
the
boat
crew
came
back
into
the
and
then
i
commenced
to
open
out
on
them
now
said
i
to
the
bully
perhaps
you
can
whip
me
but
i
can
tell
you
in
a
few
words
you
never
saw
a
boy
more
willing
to
fight
than
myself
and
if
you
will
give
me
a
boy
show
we
will
see
who
is
the
best
of
the
two
he
said
i
can
whip
you
in
a
minute
and
so
saying
he
took
off
his
coat
i
threw
mine
off
in
quick
time
ready
for
a
fight
it
was
a
good
one
he
hit
me
as
hard
as
ever
sullivan
hit
a
man
but
i
kept
dodging
my
head
so
he
would
hit
that
and
he
soon
had
his
right
hand
as
big
as
any
man
head
i
at
last
commenced
to
give
it
to
him
about
the
head
pretty
lively
and
talk
about
a
head
his
looked
like
the
of
a
beef
finally
one
of
the
crew
called
out
enough
for
him
for
he
was
not
able
to
do
so
they
carried
the
big
bully
up
stairs
and
laid
him
in
his
bed
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
the
toughest
man
i
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
for
he
was
a
powerful
man
weighed
two
hundred
pounds
and
could
hit
like
a
jack
the
pittsburgers
did
hate
to
see
their
man
get
whipped
as
he
was
their
leader
the
news
went
to
pittsburg
and
they
could
hardly
believe
that
he
could
get
the
worst
of
a
fight
at
one
time
i
was
crossing
the
levee
at
new
orleans
about
in
the
evening
when
a
big
fellow
jumped
from
behind
a
cotton
bale
and
struck
me
on
the
head
with
an
iron
which
he
held
in
both
hands
the
blow
staggered
me
and
i
fell
on
my
knees
i
caught
hold
of
the
until
i
recovered
myself
when
i
got
hold
of
him
and
took
the
pin
out
of
his
hand
i
downed
him
and
was
just
getting
ready
to
go
to
work
when
the
police
rushed
in
and
pulled
me
off
i
would
have
given
if
they
had
let
me
alone
just
half
a
minute
they
took
us
both
to
the
i
put
up
money
for
both
of
us
to
appear
as
i
wanted
to
get
at
him
again
but
he
called
on
the
police
to
accompany
him
to
his
place
of
business
he
was
a
boss
drayman
and
a
particular
friend
of
a
stevedore
i
had
whipped
a
year
previously
and
he
had
it
in
for
me
did
win
the
bags
there
was
a
man
in
new
orleans
before
the
war
that
supplied
the
steamboat
men
with
silver
to
pay
their
he
could
buy
it
at
a
discount
as
it
was
a
drug
on
the
money
market
at
that
time
i
have
often
seen
him
with
his
two
heavy
leather
bags
on
his
way
from
the
bank
to
the
boats
one
day
my
partner
charlie
bush
and
i
were
in
a
saloon
on
camp
street
when
in
walked
the
silver
man
carrying
his
heavy
leather
bags
i
gave
bush
the
wink
and
began
throwing
the
cards
on
the
counter
the
man
got
stuck
looking
at
the
game
and
when
bush
bet
me
and
won
it
he
got
more
interested
and
bet
me
the
drinks
which
i
lost
then
he
bet
me
the
cigars
and
i
lost
again
i
then
said
to
him
you
ca
guess
the
winner
for
he
said
i
will
bet
you
i
can
i
told
him
i
would
not
bet
less
than
then
bush
said
i
will
bet
you
and
we
put
up
the
money
and
bush
won
it
old
silver
got
excited
when
he
saw
bush
pocket
the
and
i
said
to
him
i
will
bet
you
against
the
silver
in
the
two
bags
he
knew
there
was
not
near
in
the
bags
so
he
jumped
them
up
on
the
counter
and
said
it
a
go
and
then
he
stood
close
and
watched
me
throw
them
until
i
said
ready
then
he
made
a
grab
and
turned
over
the
wrong
card
if
he
had
been
struck
by
lightning
he
could
not
have
acted
more
dazed
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
lost
all
control
of
himself
and
i
felt
a
little
sorry
for
him
but
business
is
business
so
i
picked
up
the
bags
and
started
to
go
when
the
fellow
came
to
his
senses
and
said
hold
on
you
did
not
win
the
bags
i
saw
he
had
me
on
the
bags
and
as
i
knew
he
had
them
made
for
the
business
i
said
to
him
if
you
get
me
something
to
put
the
money
in
you
can
have
the
bags
he
jumped
up
and
ran
out
and
when
he
returned
with
a
he
found
the
barkeeper
and
his
two
bags
but
not
bush
and
me
we
had
bought
some
towels
of
the
barkeeper
dumped
the
silver
into
them
and
lit
out
for
fear
that
the
little
old
silver
man
would
bring
back
a
cop
to
hold
us
in
place
of
something
to
hold
the
silver
the
little
fellow
was
game
and
did
not
say
anything
about
his
loss
the
next
time
i
met
him
he
requested
me
to
say
nothing
about
the
play
and
every
time
we
met
we
would
take
a
drink
and
laugh
over
the
joke
the
last
time
i
met
my
silver
friend
he
was
crippled
up
with
the
rheumatism
so
he
could
hardly
walk
and
he
was
dead
broke
i
gave
him
for
past
favors
and
i
have
not
seen
him
since
and
i
expect
he
is
now
in
his
grave
for
it
has
been
many
years
ago
since
i
won
the
silver
but
not
the
bags
the
black
charlie
clark
and
i
left
new
orleans
one
night
on
the
steamer
of
there
were
ten
or
twelve
rough
looking
fellows
on
board
who
did
their
drinking
out
of
private
bottles
charlie
opened
up
shop
in
the
cabin
and
soon
had
a
great
crowd
around
him
i
saw
that
the
devils
had
been
drinking
too
much
so
i
gave
charlie
the
wink
and
he
soon
closed
up
claiming
to
be
broke
then
we
arranged
that
i
should
do
the
playing
and
he
would
be
on
the
lookout
i
soon
got
about
all
the
money
and
some
watches
out
of
the
roughs
besides
i
beat
seven
or
eight
of
the
other
passengers
they
all
appeared
to
take
it
at
the
time
but
it
was
not
long
before
their
loss
and
the
bad
whisky
began
to
work
on
them
i
saw
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
so
i
made
a
sneak
for
my
room
changed
my
clothes
and
then
slipped
down
the
back
stairs
into
the
kitchen
i
sent
word
for
clark
to
come
down
i
then
blackened
my
face
and
hands
and
made
myself
look
like
a
hand
i
had
hardly
finished
my
disguise
when
a
terrible
rumpus
up
stairs
warned
me
that
the
ball
was
open
the
whisky
was
beginning
to
do
its
work
they
searched
everywhere
kicked
in
the
doors
turned
everything
upside
down
and
raised
h
l
generally
if
they
could
have
caught
me
then
it
would
have
been
good
bye
george
they
came
down
on
deck
walked
past
and
inquired
of
a
roustabout
who
stood
by
me
if
he
had
seen
a
man
on
deck
he
told
them
he
had
not
seen
any
gemman
down
on
deck
afore
they
came
down
they
had
their
guns
out
and
were
swearing
vengeance
the
boat
was
plowing
her
way
along
up
the
river
the
stevedores
were
hurrying
the
darkies
to
get
up
some
freight
as
a
landing
was
soon
to
be
made
the
whistle
blew
and
the
boat
was
headed
for
shore
those
devils
knew
i
would
attempt
to
leave
the
boat
so
as
soon
as
the
plank
was
put
out
they
ran
over
on
the
bank
and
closely
scanned
the
face
of
every
one
who
got
off
there
was
a
lot
of
plows
to
be
discharged
so
i
watched
my
chance
shouldered
a
plow
followed
by
a
long
line
of
coons
and
i
fairly
flew
past
the
mob
i
kept
on
up
the
high
bank
and
threw
my
plow
on
to
the
pile
and
then
i
made
for
the
cotton
fields
i
lay
down
on
my
back
until
the
boat
was
out
of
sight
and
then
i
came
out
washed
myself
white
and
took
a
boat
for
vicksburg
where
i
met
clark
the
next
day
and
we
divided
the
boodle
that
he
had
brought
with
him
he
told
me
that
after
i
had
left
the
boat
they
got
lights
and
went
down
into
the
hold
looking
for
me
as
they
were
sure
i
was
still
on
the
boat
it
was
a
pretty
close
call
but
they
were
looking
for
a
man
and
not
a
black
hard
boiled

was
going
from

of
money

an
italian

eggs
and
boil
them
hard
as
h
after
they
were
all

they
put
them
into
cold

box
i
went
back
to
the
bar
and
waited
until

that

got
out

large
bowl
and
then

best
laugh
at
the
expense
of
old
napoleon
that
i
ever
had
in
my
life
snap
games
i
was
coming
down
from
the
memphis
races
on
the
there
were
about
gamblers
on
the
boat
and
they
were
all
crazy
for
a
game
of
faro
i
told
them
i
had
a
set
of
tools
on
board
that
i
would
loan
them
if
they
wanted
to
open
they
accepted
the
offer
and
took
turns
in
opening
snaps
some
opened
as
high
as
at
a
time
i
was
playing
poker
and
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
their
game
after
supper
i
told
them
that
i
would
open
a
snap
and
they
could
tap
it
when
they
pleased
when
i
sat
down
to
deal
i
had
a
matched
set
of
boxes
you
could
not
tell
one
from
the
other
one
box
was
fixed
for
all
the
cases
to
lose
and
this
i
kept
secreted
they
knocked
me
out
of
on
one
deal
on
the
next
deal
i
shuffled
up
the
same
cards
and
put
them
in
the
box
so
they
could
see
that
everything
was
on
the
square
as
i
did
so
my
partner
tipped
over
a
big
lot
of
silver
on
the
layout
which
he
had
stacked
up
on
purpose
to
draw
their
attention
and
i
came
the
change
on
the
boxes
and
threw
my
handkerchief
over
the
box
i
held
in
my
lap
everything
went
on
all
right
the
first
case
that
showed
on
the
they
all
jumped
on
to
play
it
open
as
they
wanted
to
break
the
snap
as
then
i
would
open
another
but
the
case
lost
and
i
was
a
good
big
winner
over
the
last
deal
when
it
came
to
another
case
they
played
it
to
win
and
it
lost
but
they
did
not
think
anything
was
wrong
so
they
kept
firing
away
till
they
were
all
pretty
well
crippled
in
money
matters
they
played
the
deal
out
and
nearly
all
were
broke
at
the
end
of
the
deal
i
said
boys
i
will
have
to
quit
you
as
it
is
too
much
of
a
seesaw
game
and
then
they
commenced
to
smell
a
rat
and
you
would
have
given
to
have
heard
them
cursing
for
not
watching
me
shuffle
that
deal
the
game
closed
with
nearly
all
the
money
won
some
of
them
i
had
to
loan
money
to
pay
their
expenses
the
juergunsen
watch
i
won
a
juergunsen
watch
one
time
from
a
jew
i
put
against
it
after
i
got
the
watch
the
jew
came
to
me
and
said
look
here
i
want
to
tell
you
something
i
bought
that
watch
for
it
is
not
worth
that
much
so
help
me
gracious
but
i
bought
it
for
a
brother
on
a
farm
and
he
do
know
the
difference
tell
you
what
i
do
i
will
give
you
for
it
for
i
do
want
to
fool
him
as
i
am
going
out
there
now
i
told
him
it
was
good
enough
to
give
to
a
boy
and
i
would
keep
it
for
a
black
boy
i
had
i
tell
you
what
i
do
rather
than
let
a
nigger
boy
get
it
give
you
i
said
no
he
kept
raising
till
he
got
to
as
i
knew
i
could
get
no
more
i
let
him
have
it
after
he
got
the
watch
he
commenced
to
laugh
and
said
he
cheated
me
for
the
watch
cost
him
i
knew
what
they
cost
for
i
had
priced
the
same
watches
and
they
were
worth
at
that
time
it
was
one
of
the
finest
make
split
seconds
and
had
an
alarm
the
cases
were
very
heavy
with
a
diamond
in
the
stem
that
would
weigh
a
karat
the
jew
thought
he
had
beat
me
but
he
seemed
to
forget
that
i
had
beat
him
first
it
made
a
man
of
him
yet
fondly
we
ourselves
deceive
and
empty
hopes
pursue
though
false
to
others
we
believe
she
will
to
us
prove
true
on
my
way
up
the
river
on
board
the
old
steamer
the
boat
that
was
burned
up
during
the
war
i
won
some
money
and
a
check
for
on
the
louisiana
state
bank
of
new
orleans
the
check
was
signed
by
one
of
the
largest
planters
on
the
coast
and
i
knew
it
was
good
if
presented
before
payment
was
stopped
so
i
took
passage
on
the
one
of
the
fastest
boats
on
the
river
bound
for
new
orleans
we
landed
in
the
city
about
monday
morning
i
got
a
cab
to
take
me
down
to
the
french
market
to
get
a
cup
of
coffee
before
going
to
my
room
as
i
was
passing
the
louis
hotel
on
my
way
from
the
market
i
saw
a
man
that
i
recognized
as
hailing
from
cincinnati
i
will
not
give
his
name
he
appeared
to
be
glad
to
see
me
but
i
could
see
he
was
not
at
his
ease
so
after
a
little
while
i
thought
i
would
sound
him
so
i
said
what
was
that
trouble
you
got
into
in
cincinnati
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
and
said
how
did
you
hear
about
it
there
was
no
telegraph
line
from
cincinnati
to
new
orleans
in
those
days
i
told
him
it
was
all
right
and
he
could
trust
me
i
invited
him
to
take
breakfast
with
me
he
accepted
the
invitation
and
told
me
he
would
tell
me
about
himself
when
we
were
in
a
more
private
place
after
breakfast
we
walked
over
to
the
bank
and
i
drew
the
on
the
planter
check
then
we
went
to
my
room
and
he
told
me
his
story
he
was
a
bookkeeper
for
a
large
pork
house
became
infatuated
with
a
gay
married
woman
made
false
entries
and
finally
ran
away
with
the
enticing
married
woman
i
advised
him
to
put
on
a
disguise
for
i
knew
the
police
would
soon
be
looking
for
him
he
invited
me
to
go
with
him
and
see
his
lady
love
for
said
he
she
is
one
of
the
truest
and
best
women
in
the
world
i
went
with
him
and
met
a
very
fine
looking
lady
i
did
not
blame
him
very
much
for
being
infatuated
but
i
wondered
how
much
money
he
did
get
away
with
and
how
am
i
going
to
get
my
share
for
i
always
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
as
an
honest
man
to
win
stolen
money
i
soon
found
out
he
had
about
of
other
people
money
and
i
wanted
it
i
first
taught
him
to
play
poker
so
he
could
be
in
with
me
the
first
time
we
caught
a
sucker
i
got
clark
to
play
the
part
and
he
beat
us
out
of
most
of
which
was
pork
money
the
best
and
truest
woman
in
the
world
ran
off
with
another
fellow
which
little
thing
nearly
broke
my
young
heart
but
in
a
short
time
he
went
to
galveston
texas
got
into
a
large
cotton
house
and
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
said
george
we
live
and
learn
that
little
game
made
a
man
of
me
the
cotton
man
my
partner
and
i
were
waiting
at
the
mouth
of
red
river
for
a
boat
to
take
us
to
new
orleans
there
was
a
man
who
had
twelve
bales
of
cotton
on
the
wharf
and
he
was
also
waiting
for
a
boat
i
told
my
partner
to
get
acquainted
with
him
and
to
keep
away
from
me
the
result
was
that
they
were
good
friends
when
a
boat
arrived
we
all
took
passage
the
cotton
was
loaded
and
we
were
on
our
way
i
opened
up
the
racket
my
partner
won
and
then
the
cotton
man
was
crazy
for
he
did
not
have
any
money
to
bet
my
partner
told
him
he
would
loan
him
some
on
his
cotton
they
went
to
the
clerk
who
made
out
a
bill
of
sale
for
the
twelve
bales
he
got
the
money
and
then
he
was
happy
for
he
was
sure
of
doubling
it
with
me
he
was
happy
but
for
a
short
time
i
had
all
his
money
and
my
partner
had
all
of
his
cotton
so
he
being
a
good
friend
let
him
have
some
money
to
pay
his
expenses
he
did
not
remain
long
so
the
cost
was
not
very
heavy
the
cotton
was
worth
about
cents
per
pound
at
that
time
but
during
the
war
it
was
many
times
that
price
i
was
never
very
much
stuck
on
cotton
as
it
was
too
bulky
to
get
away
with
in
case
you
had
to
leave
a
boat
in
a
hurry
taught
a
lesson
i
was
playing
poker
with
a
man
who
after
i
had
broke
him
went
to
a
gentleman
friend
of
his
and
promised
him
dollars
for
the
loan
of
until
he
got
home
as
he
was
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
his
friend
loaned
him
the
after
he
got
a
new
stake
he
came
to
me
and
wanted
to
renew
the
play
i
had
played
a
square
game
and
believing
him
to
be
a
gentleman
i
sat
down
to
play
the
same
way
but
i
soon
saw
he
thought
himself
a
better
player
than
myself
so
i
lit
into
the
new
stake
and
it
was
not
long
until
i
had
him
broke
again
then
he
went
to
the
captain
and
set
up
a
great
kick
the
captain
said
to
him
if
you
had
won
the
money
would
you
have
given
it
back
he
said
captain
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
i
would
then
says
the
captain
why
did
you
pay
dollars
for
the
loan
of
the
money
oh
says
he
i
only
wanted
to
teach
him
a
lesson
well
says
the
captain
if
you
pay
dollars
every
time
you
want
to
teach
such
men
as
he
is
a
lesson
you
will
soon
get
broke
i
ca
do
anything
for
you
my
fine
fellow
the
passengers
laughed
at
him
and
some
called
him
a
good
teacher
and
that
broke
him
all
up
he
soon
sneaked
off
to
his
room
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
my
teacher
sinking
of
the
belle
zane
i
was
a
passenger
on
the
steamer
during
the
winter
season
and
navigation
was
expected
to
be
closed
soon
as
the
river
was
full
of
floating
ice
we
had
a
large
number
of
passengers
on
board
and
were
getting
along
very
well
until
we
left
the
ohio
we
had
left
cairo
and
were
steaming
down
the
mississippi
when
the
boat
struck
a
snag
and
in
a
very
short
time
had
sunk
down
to
the
cabin
it
was
about
four
in
the
morning
but
i
was
up
as
usual
we
had
the
passengers
out
of
their
rooms
in
quick
time
and
got
them
up
on
the
roof
in
their
night
clothes
as
there
was
no
time
for
them
to
dress
in
a
few
moments
the
cabin
separated
from
the
deck
floated
off
and
then
sank
down
until
we
were
standing
in
the
ice
and
water
nearly
knee
deep
it
was
a
terrible
sight
such
a
one
as
i
hope
and
pray
i
may
never
see
again
men
women
and
children
standing
amid
the
floating
ice
nearly
frozen
to
death
and
expecting
every
moment
to
sink
into
a
watery
grave
some
were
screaming
for
help
others
were
praying
while
others
stood
as
if
they
were
lost
i
caught
up
one
poor
woman
who
was
nearly
frozen
to
death
and
held
her
in
my
arms
above
the
water
others
did
the
same
while
the
crew
and
some
of
the
passengers
tore
the
boards
off
the
and
tried
to
paddle
the
wreck
to
shore
we
floated
down
until
we
struck
a
point
the
men
that
were
doing
the
paddling
jumped
off
onto
the
shore
and
then
held
on
to
the
wreck
until
they
swung
it
around
into
an
eddy
we
got
all
the
passengers
off
but
it
was
about
a
mile
to
the
nearest
house
we
were
all
nearly
freezing
and
there
was
not
one
of
us
that
did
not
have
our
feet
frozen
we
had
no
fire
nor
any
way
to
make
one
some
of
us
who
were
lucky
enough
to
have
coats
took
them
off
and
wrapped
up
the
women
and
children
we
then
took
them
to
a
house
that
was
about
a
mile
distant
and
the
good
people
did
all
in
their
power
to
make
us
comfortable
the
news
reached
cairo
and
they
sent
a
boat
with
blankets
provisions
and
medical
aid
to
our
relief
three
or
four
men
jumped
overboard
and
tried
to
swim
ashore
but
got
chilled
and
were
drowned
some
of
the
women
were
frozen
so
badly
that
they
did
not
survive
i
feel
the
effect
in
my
feet
to
this
day
and
the
accident
happened
over
thirty
years
ago
jew
jew
when
greek
meets
greek
then
comes
the
tug
of
war
when
jew
meets
jew
they
want
each
other
gore
we
were
going
down
the
river
from
baton
rouge
at
one
time
and
i
had
an
old
fellow
with
me
they
called
jew
mose
there
was
a
young
jew
from
vidalia
on
board
and
mose
got
him
into
a
game
of
euchre
we
had
not
played
long
until
the
young
jew
said
i
have
got
a
good
poker
hand
mose
spoke
up
and
said
my
hand
is
worth
ten
dollars
then
the
young
one
put
up
his
money
and
as
mose
had
nothing
he
backed
out
i
saw
vidalia
had
some
nerve
and
money
so
on
my
deal
i
ran
up
two
hands
giving
the
young
one
four
kings
and
the
old
one
four
aces
mose
said
i
have
a
poker
hand
vidalia
said
my
hand
is
worth
dollars
and
he
put
up
i
tipped
my
hand
to
him
and
raised
it
at
the
same
time
giving
mose
the
office
not
to
raise
as
i
thought
it
was
all
the
fellow
would
stand
they
both
called
we
showed
down
and
mose
had
won
the
money
he
made
a
reach
for
it
when
vidalia
made
a
grab
but
mose
was
too
quick
for
him
then
the
young
one
jumped
up
and
said
to
mose
you
are
a
jew
and
i
a
jew
and
you
have
my
money
mose
would
not
give
up
so
at
it
they
went
they
hit
bit
scratched
gouged
and
pulled
hair
until
they
were
rolling
around
in
each
other
gore
everybody
came
running
to
see
what
had
broken
loose
and
it
was
ducks
to
see
those
two
fellows
fight
neither
would
give
up
and
it
is
no
telling
how
long
the
circus
tumbling
would
have
kept
up
if
the
officers
of
the
boat
had
not
separated
them
after
the
fight
the
cabin
looked
as
if
we
had
been
fighting
a
newfoundland
dogs
from
the
amount
of
blood
and
black
hair
that
was
on
the
floor
the
young
one
told
mose
if
he
ever
came
to
vidalia
he
would
lick
him
so
we
supposed
from
that
remark
that
he
did
not
feel
satisfied
with
the
result
poor
old
mose
did
not
live
long
enough
to
visit
vidalia
so
the
young
one
could
make
his
word
good
for
he
went
up
to
chicago
and
soon
after
died
beat
a
good
hand
i
beat
a
man
at
poker
out
of
on
the
steamer
after
he
quit
playing
he
asked
me
where
i
would
get
off
i
told
at
the
mouth
of
red
river
when
i
left
the
boat
i
saw
my
friend
had
concluded
to
stop
at
the
same
place
it
was
not
long
before
an
officer
called
on
me
to
take
a
walk
with
him
and
we
said
we
will
go
up
and
see
the
judge
when
we
arrived
at
his
place
of
business
i
found
that
my
friend
was
there
before
me
the
judge
spoke
to
him
before
he
did
to
me
and
said
how
did
this
man
swindle
you
out
of
your
money
we
were
playing
poker
your
honor
do
you
call
playing
poker
swindling
said
the
judge
well
your
honor
he
must
have
swindled
me
for
every
time
i
had
a
good
hand
he
would
beat
it
said
he
if
that
is
all
the
evidence
you
have
the
case
is
closed
the
defendant
is
dismissed
and
you
will
be
held
for
the
costs
said
his
honor
i
told
the
judge
i
would
pay
the
costs
if
he
would
let
the
fellow
go
he
accepted
the
proposition
and
that
night
i
had
the
honor
of
playing
in
the
same
game
with
the
judge
and
i
played
a
square
game
for
once
in
my
life
for
fear
i
would
have
another
friend
who
would
want
to
see
me
at
his
honor
office
they
paid
the
costs
i
had
beat
a
man
out
of
on
the
railroad
from
new
orleans
to
jackson
i
saw
that
if
i
got
off
he
would
put
me
to
some
trouble
so
i
kept
on
until
i
got
to
canton
miles
above
he
followed
me
there
and
had
me
arrested
the
trial
was
to
come
off
in
an
hour
as
it
was
meal
time
with
the
judge
we
were
all
assembled
in
the
and
the
judge
wanted
him
to
tell
how
i
got
his
money
he
said
i
could
show
you
judge
if
i
had
some
cards
i
pulled
out
some
of
the
same
cards
i
beat
him
with
and
gave
them
to
the
judge
and
he
wanted
to
know
how
they
could
bet
money
on
the
three
cards
i
said
judge
i
will
show
you
so
you
can
understand
i
took
the
cards
and
mixed
them
over
a
few
times
telling
the
judge
to
watch
the
jack
he
did
watch
it
and
he
could
turn
it
over
every
time
as
one
of
the
corners
of
the
jack
was
turned
up
and
he
said
it
was
as
fair
a
game
as
he
ever
saw
i
told
him
i
had
two
chances
to
his
one
so
he
dismissed
the
case
i
came
near
giving
it
to
the
judge
for
a
few
dollars
and
then
give
them
back
but
i
thought
best
not
to
do
so
when
the
fellow
went
out
of
the
the
canton
boys
laughed
at
him
and
called
him
a
fool
after
he
left
the
judge
and
i
went
over
to
a
saloon
and
had
some
cigars
he
said
he
dearly
loved
to
play
poker
but
i
did
not
want
any
of
his
game
as
i
thought
i
might
need
him
again
some
time
and
it
proved
i
was
right
for
it
was
not
long
after
that
i
was
coming
down
on
the
train
from
vicksburg
and
beat
five
or
six
of
the
passengers
out
of
a
few
hundred
dollars
when
we
got
to
canton
we
were
behind
time
and
missed
connection
and
had
to
lay
over
until
night
they
had
me
arrested
for
the
same
trick
and
taken
before
the
same
judge
and
you
ought
to
have
heard
him
after
he
found
out
how
they
had
lost
their
money
for
he
just
gave
them
a
good
turning
over
he
called
them
a
lot
of
babies
and
put
the
costs
of
the
court
on
them
i
got
the
judge
a
box
of
fine
cigars
and
went
down
on
the
same
train
but
i
was
in
the
sleeper
and
they
did
not
see
me
until
i
got
to
new
orleans
i
played
poker
in
the
sleeper
all
the
way
to
the
city
and
did
not
lose
very
much
as
the
game
was
small
and
we
played
on
the
square
i
met
some
of
them
at
the
opera
the
same
night
and
they
had
their
opera
glasses
pointed
at
me
for
some
time
i
guess
they
wondered
how
i
got
there
so
soon
my
first
love
love
gives
esteem
and
then
he
gives
desert
he
either
finds
equality
or
makes
it
like
death
he
knows
no
difference
in
degrees
but
frames
and
levels
all
there
was
a
dance
in
the
cabin
of
the
steamer
one
night
which
was
a
fine
affair
as
there
were
a
great
many
wealthy
people
on
board
i
had
not
done
any
playing
on
the
boat
so
i
put
on
my
good
harness
and
went
back
into
the
ladies
cabin
to
join
in
the
dance
i
was
introduced
to
a
number
of
fine
ladies
among
whom
was
a
beautiful
young
widow
she
joined
me
in
a
waltz
another
dance
and
a
promenade
on
the
guards
i
thought
her
the
most
agreeable
and
sweetest
woman
i
had
ever
met
in
my
life
i
was
in
her
society
most
of
the
time
until
the
dancing
ceased
and
then
i
bade
her
good
night
good
night
parting
is
such
sweet
sorrow
that
i
shall
say
good
night
till
it
be
morrow
i
met
the
fascinating
widow
the
next
day
and
before
i
bade
her
i
had
received
a
pressing
invitation
to
visit
her
at
her
plantation
and
boys
you
can
bet
your
life
it
was
not
long
before
i
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
during
my
visit
i
received
every
attention
the
negroes
could
not
have
done
more
for
their
master
there
was
a
nice
lake
on
the
plantation
the
servants
would
drive
the
lady
and
i
over
to
it
and
we
would
enjoy
ourselves
at
fishing
for
a
few
hours
on
our
return
she
would
play
and
sing
for
me
and
as
i
sat
and
looked
at
her
i
thought
what
would
i
give
if
i
was
a
square
man
and
how
happy
i
could
be
with
such
a
woman
as
my
wife
i
did
not
tell
her
my
business
for
fear
she
would
think
less
of
me
i
could
not
endure
the
deception
so
after
three
days
of
happiness
i
tore
myself
away
feeling
as
if
i
was
unfixed
for
life
in
a
short
time
she
visited
relatives
in
new
orleans
and
sent
me
an
invitation
to
call
but
as
i
was
acquainted
with
her
friends
the
same
old
dread
came
upon
me
so
i
declined
with
the
excuse
that
i
was
compelled
to
leave
the
city
the
same
evening
on
the
steamer
we
met
again
on
board
a
steamer
she
had
been
told
my
business
but
she
treated
me
more
kindly
than
ever
before
she
begged
me
to
quit
gambling
and
settle
down
i
partly
agreed
to
do
as
she
wished
we
spent
a
very
pleasant
time
together
for
i
would
not
attend
to
business
while
she
was
on
the
same
boat
before
she
left
the
steamer
she
took
off
a
large
diamond
ring
and
said
to
me
wear
this
until
we
meet
again
i
tried
to
refuse
it
but
she
insisted
so
i
at
last
accepted
the
token
i
bade
her
at
the
and
went
up
on
deck
she
remained
on
the
levee
waving
her
handkerchief
and
i
returned
the
compliment
until
we
were
out
of
sight
i
talked
to
the
clerk
until
i
felt
that
i
was
myself
again
and
then
i
started
out
to
find
a
sucker
for
i
had
enjoyed
the
pleasure
before
business
it
was
about
three
months
before
i
saw
my
lady
love
again
i
was
glad
to
see
her
and
she
appeared
to
be
pleased
at
meeting
me
before
we
parted
i
put
the
ring
back
on
her
finger
but
she
said
she
did
not
want
it
and
i
believe
she
meant
what
she
said
i
received
another
invitation
to
visit
her
at
her
plantation
which
i
have
neglected
to
this
day
and
that
has
been
over
thirty
years
ago
i
have
often
thought
what
a
different
man
i
might
have
been
if
i
had
accepted
that
last
invitation
there
is
one
thing
that
i
am
sure
of
and
that
is
if
i
had
married
my
first
love
i
would
not
now
be
writing
forty
years
a
gambler
on
the
mississippi
the
boys
from
texas
i
got
on
the
steamer
at
baton
rouge
bound
for
new
orleans
it
was
on
a
new
year
eve
everybody
was
feeling
jolly
and
i
felt
somewhat
that
way
myself
there
were
five
tables
of
poker
going
at
one
time
so
i
opened
up
the
good
old
game
of
monte
for
the
benefit
of
a
lot
of
texas
boys
that
did
play
poker
they
all
got
around
the
table
and
watched
me
throw
in
a
short
time
my
capper
came
up
and
wanted
me
to
show
him
how
to
play
the
game
i
showed
him
and
he
wanted
to
bet
a
dollar
i
told
him
if
that
was
all
the
money
he
had
he
had
better
keep
it
he
got
as
mad
as
a
wet
hen
and
told
me
he
had
just
as
much
money
as
i
had
he
pulled
out
a
big
roll
and
slashed
down
saying
i
will
bet
you
i
can
turn
the
winner
i
said
you
ca
bluff
me
and
i
put
up
he
turned
one
of
the
cards
and
lost
while
i
was
putting
the
money
away
he
picked
up
the
cards
and
turned
up
a
corner
on
the
winner
letting
the
boys
see
what
he
had
done
then
he
said
to
me
mix
them
up
again
which
i
did
and
he
put
down
a
roll
claiming
it
to
be
he
turned
and
won
then
the
boys
began
to
nudge
each
other
and
get
nervous
the
capper
then
said
i
will
let
it
all
lay
and
bet
you
again
he
turned
and
caught
me
for
and
then
you
should
have
seen
the
boys
from
texas
there
never
was
such
a
cutting
of
cloths
one
fellow
pulled
off
his
new
coat
and
cut
the
lining
nearly
all
to
pieces
another
took
off
his
coat
vest
and
shirt
for
his
money
was
sewed
up
in
his
undershirt
others
had
their
money
down
their
boot
legs
tied
to
a
string
so
that
they
could
pull
it
up
when
they
wanted
it
they
all
wanted
it
just
then
and
they
were
in
the
biggest
hurry
of
any
suckers
i
ever
saw
they
all
put
up
their
pile
except
two
or
three
who
had
more
than
the
rest
i
told
them
to
pick
out
one
boy
to
turn
the
card
so
they
selected
jim
who
was
their
leader
jim
made
a
grab
for
a
sure
thing
but
when
he
turned
it
over
all
the
boys
were
they
had
lost
their
money
they
took
it
and
said
it
was
fair
one
said
i
was
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
and
if
he
could
do
it
as
slick
as
i
did
he
could
get
all
the
money
out
in
their
country
i
promised
that
i
would
come
out
and
see
them
and
that
they
would
all
be
in
with
me
i
did
not
say
just
when
i
would
keep
my
promise
and
as
i
do
not
like
too
many
partners
i
have
put
it
off
over
thirty
years
in
hopes
that
some
of
the
boys
would
give
it
up
and
move
out
of
the
country
so
if
a
slick
man
did
get
all
of
their
money
he
would
not
have
to
divide
up
so
often
marked
cards
while
waiting
for
a
boat
at
donelsville
to
take
me
to
new
orleans
i
fell
in
with
a
fellow
who
proposed
a
game
of
cards
to
pass
the
time
until
the
boat
arrived
we
went
into
a
saloon
and
sat
down
to
play
a
game
of
poker
he
brought
out
an
old
deck
of
marked
cards
which
i
recognized
the
minute
i
saw
them
we
began
to
play
i
knew
the
fellow
took
me
for
a
sucker
so
i
let
him
play
me
with
his
cards
until
i
got
a
chance
to
down
him
which
i
did
for
all
he
had
amounting
to
about
about
this
time
some
one
announced
that
a
boat
was
coming
so
i
proposed
to
quit
but
gambler
did
not
want
any
quit
in
his
so
long
as
he
was
loser
and
he
had
a
sucker
i
knew
he
had
but
little
if
any
money
left
so
i
quit
and
started
for
the
landing
the
boat
had
arrived
and
was
just
about
ready
to
leave
when
an
officer
stepped
up
to
me
and
said
i
have
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
the
h
l
you
have
what
have
i
done
you
have
swindled
a
gentleman
out
of
his
money
sir
says
he
all
right
sir
i
will
go
with
you
he
took
me
before
a
magistrate
and
there
was
the
fellow
who
had
played
the
marked
cards
on
me
the
justice
wanted
to
know
how
i
had
swindled
him
he
said
he
put
up
the
cards
on
me
in
a
game
of
poker
and
he
is
a
gambler
you
ought
to
have
heard
that
old
fellow
give
it
to
me
he
said
how
dare
you
sir
come
in
this
place
and
rob
our
respectable
citizens
out
of
their
money
i
will
teach
you
a
lesson
that
you
will
not
soon
forget
he
was
going
on
in
this
strain
when
i
stopped
him
by
saying
hold
on
your
honor
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
go
on
sir
well
says
i
this
man
invited
me
to
play
a
game
of
poker
with
him
and
when
we
sat
down
to
play
he
brought
out
this
old
deck
of
marked
cards
on
me
and
i
happened
to
know
them
as
well
if
not
better
than
he
did
he
took
me
for
a
sucker
and
i
beat
him
at
his
own
game
he
calls
me
a
gambler
but
he
is
much
worse
for
he
attempted
to
rob
me
with
those
marked
cards
show
me
the
marks
on
those
cards
said
the
justice
so
i
walked
up
and
began
reading
the
cards
by
their
backs
to
him
he
watched
me
as
i
read
the
cards
until
i
called
a
ten
spot
and
turned
it
over
then
he
grabbed
it
up
and
examined
the
back
and
said
hold
on
that
will
do
this
is
the
same
deck
those
d
d
rascals
have
been
playing
on
me
for
the
other
night
this
ten
of
hearts
fell
in
the
spit
and
here
is
the
mark
on
it
now
they
have
been
swindling
me
for
the
last
six
months
then
turning
to
me
he
said
you
are
dismissed
but
i
will
fine
this
rascal
and
costs
and
send
him
to
jail
if
he
does
not
pay
it
immediately
i
thanked
the
justice
for
his
just
decision
and
took
the
next
boat
to
new
orleans
my
crooked
partner
my
partner
hugh
foster
and
i
were
on
board
the
bound
for
new
orleans
foster
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
wolf
and
i
did
not
have
much
use
for
him
he
was
acquainted
with
a
man
on
board
that
claimed
to
have
a
man
who
had
five
thousand
dollars
and
he
could
make
him
lose
against
monte
but
he
wanted
half
or
there
would
be
no
play
foster
told
him
to
get
his
man
into
a
and
they
would
win
the
money
and
not
let
devol
know
anything
about
it
so
foster
came
to
me
and
said
george
we
will
not
try
to
do
anything
until
after
we
leave
cairo
will
we
no
i
said
i
want
all
the
sleep
i
can
get
foster
said
he
felt
tired
and
would
go
to
bed
i
knew
that
the
sneak
had
some
scheme
on
hand
so
i
went
to
my
room
but
i
did
not
go
to
bed
i
went
out
the
back
door
and
up
on
the
roof
where
i
could
see
what
was
going
on
down
in
the
cabin
i
had
not
been
on
watch
very
long
until
i
saw
foster
come
out
of
his
room
and
in
a
short
time
go
into
another
with
two
gentlemen
i
slipped
down
off
the
roof
went
out
on
the
guards
and
called
all
the
men
into
the
barber
shop
i
told
them
i
had
a
new
game
that
i
wanted
to
show
them
it
was
a
new
game
to
them
and
they
were
very
much
interested
in
it
as
i
let
them
win
several
small
bets
after
i
got
it
well
worked
up
i
said
now
gentlemen
i
will
not
take
any
more
small
bets
but
will
bet
that
no
one
can
turn
the
jack
the
first
time
just
then
the
barkeeper
came
in
and
i
said
i
will
bet
you
that
you
turn
the
jack
he
counted
out
the
money
and
put
it
up
i
mixed
them
and
he
turned
up
the
winner
he
then
walked
out
and
i
knew
if
there
was
any
big
money
i
would
get
it
i
began
to
mix
them
again
when
up
stepped
a
big
fellow
and
asked
me
what
was
the
least
i
would
bet
i
sized
him
up
and
then
i
said
he
pulled
out
and
put
up
i
counted
out
the
same
amount
and
put
it
up
on
my
side
of
the
table
so
if
there
would
be
any
snatching
i
could
get
there
in
time
i
then
saw
he
had
some
left
so
i
said
i
would
back
out
and
treat
this
made
him
very
anxious
and
he
said
no
i
will
not
let
you
back
out
then
i
said
if
you
will
not
let
me
out
i
will
bet
you
as
i
might
as
well
be
hung
for
an
old
sheep
as
a
lamb
he
put
up
the
and
turned
the
card
but
as
i
had
two
chances
to
his
one
he
made
the
same
mistake
that
thousands
had
made
before
and
turned
up
the
wrong
one
he
walked
off
without
a
word
and
sat
down
on
the
guards
i
kept
an
eye
on
him
but
he
was
game
and
took
his
medicine
just
as
i
had
taken
it
many
a
time
at
the
bank
i
kept
on
playing
until
i
had
taken
in
all
the
and
a
large
white
diamond
stud
that
was
worth
about
then
i
closed
up
shop
and
invited
all
to
join
me
in
a
drink
they
all
accepted
except
my
friend
he
was
too
busy
thinking
how
it
was
that
he
had
turned
up
the
wrong
card
when
he
could
see
so
plainly
that
the
right
card
had
one
corner
bent
while
we
were
drinking
in
came
foster
and
he
looked
as
if
he
had
just
been
pulled
out
of
the
river
for
it
was
a
very
hot
day
and
the
fellow
had
been
in
a
close
for
an
hour
and
had
not
won
a
cent
i
said
you
look
warm
come
and
join
us
in
a
drink
he
took
a
drink
saying
it
was
so
hot
i
could
not
sleep
i
took
the
diamond
stud
out
of
my
pocket
and
showed
it
to
the
barkeeper
foster
saw
it
and
said
george
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
that
stone
what
will
you
give
for
it
said
i
he
looked
at
it
then
offered
me
i
told
him
he
could
have
it
so
he
paid
me
the
money
and
put
the
stud
in
his
shirt
in
a
few
moments
after
he
got
the
stone
a
gentleman
said
to
him
that
is
a
very
fine
stone
i
am
acquainted
with
the
gentleman
who
lost
it
he
is
a
large
jeweler
in
st
louis
you
must
be
mistaken
said
foster
oh
no
i
am
not
for
i
saw
him
lose
it
in
the
barber
shop
about
half
an
hour
ago
foster
came
to
me
and
said
george
you
did
not
make
a
play
did
you
oh
yes
did
you
not
make
one
yourself
that
made
him
look
sick
but
when
a
friend
of
mine
came
up
and
said
devol
you
must
have
won
in
that
play
then
he
looked
sicker
i
said
yes
i
guess
i
got
about
out
of
it
and
i
will
treat
while
we
were
drinking
the
barkeeper
handed
me
the
he
had
won
i
gave
him
for
his
cap
and
then
foster
began
to
give
me
taffy
i
told
him
i
did
not
want
anything
more
to
do
with
him
that
i
had
heard
he
was
a
sneak
etc
he
got
off
at
cairo
and
i
was
glad
to
get
rid
of
him
i
had
a
good
wheel
game
down
to
memphis
where
i
got
off
and
lost
against
faro
i
took
a
boat
for
new
orleans
and
made
more
than
i
lost
in
memphis
before
i
reached
the
city
judge
devol
i
was
on
board
the
of
bound
for
new
orleans
there
was
a
large
number
of
passengers
and
a
heavy
load
of
freight
the
roof
was
literally
covered
with
coops
full
of
chickens
and
turkeys
i
had
old
monte
running
in
full
blast
but
the
chicken
men
could
not
bet
as
they
were
going
to
market
instead
of
coming
away
they
were
so
very
much
interested
in
the
game
that
they
forgot
to
watch
their
coops
after
a
while
one
of
them
went
up
and
found
that
some
one
had
stolen
some
of
the
chickens
the
pilot
told
him
he
saw
the
man
taking
them
so
he
went
down
and
told
the
captain
and
he
sent
for
the
pilot
to
pick
out
the
thief
they
found
him
and
brought
him
into
the
cabin
when
some
one
proposed
to
try
him
by
judge
and
jury
so
they
elected
me
judge
and
i
impaneled
a
jury
we
heard
the
evidence
and
the
attorneys
made
their
arguments
then
i
charged
the
jury
and
they
retired
to
the
as
we
did
not
have
any
regular
jury
room
they
were
out
about
as
long
as
it
would
take
a
barkeeper
to
make
up
twelve
drinks
and
then
they
filed
back
into
the
each
one
putting
his
handkerchief
away
as
if
they
had
all
been
crying
over
the
awful
verdict
they
were
about
to
render
i
asked
the
foreman
if
they
had
agreed
upon
a
verdict
and
he
said
we
have
your
honor
just
at
this
time
there
was
some
commotion
in
the
occasioned
no
doubt
at
the
sight
of
the
twelve
handkerchiefs
i
told
the
sheriff
to
rap
for
order
but
it
was
some
little
time
before
it
could
be
restored
i
then
told
the
jury
to
stand
up
and
hear
their
verdict
the
foreman
read
the
verdict
which
was
we
the
jury
find
the
defendant
guilty
i
then
told
the
defendant
to
stand
up
and
hear
his
sentence
you
are
to
return
the
chickens
to
their
owner
pay
a
fine
of
six
bottles
of
wine
and
the
costs
of
this
suit
and
be
imprisoned
in
the
until
the
fine
and
costs
are
paid
as
there
were
no
other
cases
on
the
docket
i
ordered
the
sheriff
to
adjourn
court
to
the
bar
the
sheriff
went
up
with
the
man
who
had
lost
the
chickens
and
they
picked
out
three
dozen
when
they
came
down
and
reported
to
me
that
they
had
returned
three
dozen
chickens
the
criminal
yelled
out
that
he
had
only
taken
one
dozen
the
poor
fellow
did
not
have
the
money
to
pay
for
the
wine
so
he
had
to
give
a
bill
of
sale
for
his
chickens
after
all
of
my
judicial
duties
were
performed
and
while
the
bar
of
justice
was
full
of
people
and
the
people
were
full
of
what
they
got
at
the
bar
i
opened
up
the
dear
little
racket
and
in
a
short
time
i
owned
every
chicken
and
turkey
on
the
roof
of
that
boat
what
to
do
with
my
live
stock
i
did
not
know
i
had
a
bill
of
sale
from
the
chicken
men
but
what
i
wanted
just
then
was
a
chicken
buyer
i
at
last
had
an
offer
from
the
second
clerk
which
was
much
less
than
the
market
value
but
as
i
never
had
much
use
for
anything
i
could
not
put
in
my
pocket
i
accepted
his
offer
and
sold
out
the
chicken
men
had
no
business
in
new
orleans
as
they
had
sold
in
transit
and
not
one
of
them
had
any
money
so
i
called
them
up
to
the
office
and
gave
each
one
money
enough
to
take
him
back
to
cairo
my
partner
alexander
i
went
on
board
the
steamer
at
memphis
bound
for
new
orleans
it
was
ten
at
night
and
i
did
not
think
of
doing
any
business
until
the
next
day
while
standing
talking
to
the
barkeeper
a
man
walked
in
and
proposed
to
shake
him
for
the
drinks
they
shook
and
the
stranger
lost
he
then
proposed
to
shake
for
five
dollars
and
asked
me
if
i
would
come
in
and
make
it
handed
i
said
i
would
for
a
time
or
two
we
shook
and
he
was
a
little
loser
when
he
wanted
to
make
it
ten
dollars
i
consented
but
the
barkeeper
dropped
out
we
sat
down
and
soon
were
shaking
for
a
game
we
were
drinking
during
the
time
and
it
was
not
very
long
until
i
had
won
the
fellow
was
pretty
full
so
i
thought
i
would
complete
the
filling
and
then
he
would
go
to
bed
as
i
expected
it
was
not
long
before
he
turned
in
and
i
was
at
liberty
to
look
around
i
went
into
the
cabin
and
found
three
games
of
poker
in
full
blast
i
was
looking
at
one
of
the
games
when
i
noticed
a
man
looking
at
me
he
gave
me
a
sign
and
i
walked
out
to
the
guards
he
followed
me
and
said
you
do
not
remember
me
my
name
is
alexander
i
met
you
in
louis
over
a
year
ago
i
heard
that
you
and
clark
had
split
up
and
i
am
now
on
my
way
to
new
orleans
to
meet
you
for
i
want
to
go
to
work
i
told
him
that
i
was
alone
and
that
we
would
begin
our
work
on
the
morrow
we
were
in
the
barber
shop
the
next
day
when
a
man
came
to
me
and
told
me
that
he
was
a
brother
of
mike
carroll
and
he
wanted
to
cap
for
me
as
i
knew
carroll
well
i
told
him
to
go
ahead
we
were
playing
monte
and
i
had
beat
a
man
out
of
six
gold
pieces
when
we
came
to
settle
up
there
was
one
gold
piece
missing
so
i
said
boys
there
is
one
gold
piece
short
alexander
proposed
a
search
and
carroll
said
i
have
not
got
a
cent
and
that
is
why
i
wanted
to
cap
in
order
to
pay
my
passage
we
commenced
the
search
and
when
we
took
off
carroll
hat
the
gold
piece
dropped
out
so
i
paid
his
passage
and
let
him
go
at
the
expiration
of
four
years
alexander
showed
me
receipts
for
money
he
had
sent
to
his
home
in
dover
amounting
to
and
he
was
not
a
stingy
man
either
for
he
was
a
good
liver
and
dresser
and
i
have
known
him
often
to
spend
as
much
as
in
a
night
for
wine
etc
he
has
often
talked
to
me
about
playing
the
bank
and
wanted
me
to
quit
it
and
i
can
now
see
if
i
had
taken
his
advice
i
might
have
been
worth
forty
times
the
quadroon
girl
i
got
on
the
one
afternoon
at
vicksburg
and
as
i
claimed
to
be
a
planter
from
white
river
i
soon
became
acquainted
with
some
planters
that
lived
on
the
coast
there
was
a
game
of
poker
started
and
i
was
invited
to
sit
in
we
played
until
supper
was
ready
i
had
played
on
the
square
and
had
won
a
few
hundred
dollars
after
supper
they
got
up
a
dance
and
that
spoiled
the
game
i
was
sitting
in
the
hall
when
one
of
the
planters
came
to
me
and
said
do
you
dance
no
i
do
care
to
dance
where
i
am
not
acquainted
you
are
like
me
in
that
respect
i
had
rather
play
poker
but
as
those
gentlemen
who
were
playing
in
the
game
have
all
got
their
families
on
board
they
will
not
play
so
what
do
you
say
to
us
having
a
game
i
said
i
did
not
care
to
play
a
while
but
i
would
rather
be
a
little
more
private
and
that
we
might
go
up
into
the
texas
and
play
we
got
the
checks
at
the
bar
and
the
barkeeper
did
not
forget
a
deck
of
my
cards
we
went
up
and
had
just
got
seated
when
up
came
my
partner
and
said
gentlemen
are
you
going
to
sport
a
little
we
are
will
you
join
us
said
the
planter
what
are
you
going
to
play
poker
of
course
he
sat
in
and
then
it
was
a
very
nice
gentlemanly
game
we
played
on
the
square
for
a
while
that
is
if
the
cards
had
been
square
finally
i
could
put
it
off
no
longer
so
i
ran
up
two
hands
giving
the
planter
three
eights
and
then
downed
him
for
over
we
played
a
little
while
longer
and
then
i
ran
up
two
more
hands
and
guarded
them
so
nothing
could
fall
in
that
time
i
gave
my
partner
the
best
hand
and
he
took
in
about
the
planter
was
then
over
loser
so
he
excused
himself
for
a
few
minutes
and
i
knew
that
he
had
gone
after
more
money
he
soon
returned
with
and
that
lasted
him
about
one
hour
he
got
up
and
said
boys
i
must
have
some
more
money
my
partner
and
i
went
down
with
him
as
i
did
not
think
he
could
get
any
more
we
were
at
the
bar
taking
a
drink
when
he
turned
to
me
and
said
i
would
like
to
play
some
more
but
i
ca
get
any
more
money
unless
you
will
loan
me
some
on
my
negro
as
i
have
one
on
board
that
i
paid
for
and
she
is
one
of
the
most
likely
girls
you
ever
saw
i
winked
at
my
partner
to
loan
him
some
money
on
his
wench
he
went
back
and
brought
out
one
of
the
prettiest
quadroon
girls
about
seventeen
years
old
that
i
ever
saw
my
partner
loaned
him
and
got
the
clerk
to
draw
up
a
bill
of
sale
then
we
resumed
the
game
but
that
did
not
last
him
but
about
half
an
hour
for
i
beat
him
out
of
nearly
the
whole
amount
on
one
hand
and
that
broke
up
the
game
he
had
but
dollars
left
we
went
down
and
took
a
drink
and
then
went
to
bed
the
next
day
he
got
the
money
and
redeemed
his
girl
then
he
said
to
me
i
have
got
about
so
let
us
go
up
and
play
handed
we
went
up
and
i
soon
got
that
money
he
said
in
all
my
poker
playing
i
never
played
so
unlucky
in
my
life
he
went
to
my
partner
and
borrowed
more
on
the
girl
and
i
took
that
in
he
then
went
to
captain
keys
and
tried
to
borrow
the
money
to
redeem
his
girl
again
but
the
captain
would
not
loan
it
to
him
he
found
a
man
that
loaned
him
the
money
and
he
redeemed
her
again
he
was
considerable
loser
but
he
got
some
more
wine
in
him
then
he
wanted
more
poker
but
i
told
my
partner
not
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
his
negro
for
it
was
making
too
much
talk
on
the
boat
already
when
he
got
to
his
landing
he
and
his
negro
left
the
boat
and
i
tell
you
she
was
a
dandy
the
captain
spoiled
the
game
i
was
coming
out
of
new
orleans
one
night
on
the
a
cincinnati
boat
and
she
was
full
of
good
looking
suckers
i
went
out
on
the
guards
and
called
them
all
into
the
cabin
and
opened
up
monte
they
all
gathered
around
the
table
and
among
them
was
the
captain
of
the
boat
who
insisted
on
betting
i
said
to
him
you
are
the
captain
of
the
boat
and
i
do
not
want
to
bet
with
you
he
kept
insisting
that
his
money
was
just
as
good
as
anybody
and
he
put
up
i
gave
my
capper
the
office
to
take
him
away
but
he
would
not
have
it
i
then
told
him
i
would
not
bet
less
than
he
called
to
the
clerk
to
bring
him
and
then
he
put
up
i
told
him
not
to
bet
if
the
loss
would
distress
him
when
he
told
me
it
was
his
money
i
told
him
to
turn
the
card
for
i
saw
it
was
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
him
he
turned
and
lost
then
he
got
mad
and
made
me
close
up
i
had
no
intention
of
keeping
his
money
so
i
walked
out
on
the
guards
and
then
up
on
the
roof
where
i
found
him
i
said
here
is
your
money
i
did
not
want
you
to
bet
and
you
have
knocked
me
out
of
many
a
good
dollar
he
was
surprised
to
get
his
money
back
and
he
said
he
bet
in
good
faith
i
talked
to
him
until
he
told
me
i
could
open
up
again
and
then
i
told
him
to
give
me
the
and
so
soon
as
i
got
opened
up
for
him
to
come
up
and
make
a
play
and
i
would
let
him
win
it
back
i
went
down
and
called
all
the
boys
into
the
cabin
again
and
had
just
begun
to
throw
them
when
up
stepped
the
captain
and
said
i
lost
once
but
i
will
try
it
again
so
he
put
up
and
won
the
money
then
he
walked
away
then
a
sucker
pulled
out
his
wallet
and
offered
to
bet
me
i
saw
he
had
plenty
left
so
i
said
i
will
not
bet
less
than
while
he
was
hesitating
my
partner
came
forward
and
said
he
did
not
have
that
much
money
but
he
would
bet
that
he
could
turn
the
winner
i
took
him
up
and
he
lost
then
the
sucker
was
all
excitement
for
he
saw
that
he
did
turn
the
card
with
the
corner
turned
up
so
he
wanted
to
bet
i
would
not
bet
less
than
so
he
at
last
put
up
i
gave
them
one
more
shuffle
and
then
he
was
so
nervous
that
he
turned
the
wrong
card
it
made
him
so
sick
that
he
went
out
on
the
guards
and
threw
up
his
supper
the
balance
of
the
suckers
did
not
want
to
get
sick
so
i
closed
up
but
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
captain
first
play
i
would
have
done
a
much
better
business
on
that
boat
such
is
luck
too
sick
to
fight
i
was
playing
poker
on
the
steamer
with
a
negro
trader
and
had
won
some
money
from
him
when
he
got
up
and
went
down
on
the
boiler
deck
in
a
little
while
he
came
back
followed
by
an
old
black
woman
and
wanted
me
to
loan
him
on
her
she
was
too
old
for
me
so
i
told
him
i
was
not
keeping
a
but
my
partner
told
him
he
would
loan
him
on
her
if
he
would
make
out
a
bill
of
sale
the
bill
was
made
out
and
he
got
the
money
we
began
another
game
and
in
about
half
and
hour
i
had
his
for
we
were
playing
with
my
cards
and
they
never
went
back
on
me
or
told
me
a
lie
he
went
off
borrowed
some
more
money
and
wanted
to
renew
the
game
but
as
he
was
getting
very
drunk
i
declined
to
play
with
him
any
longer
then
he
set
up
a
kick
and
said
he
had
been
cheated
i
told
him
all
suckers
talked
that
way
when
they
lost
their
money
that
made
him
hotter
than
ever
and
he
wanted
to
fight
i
told
him
i
was
sickly
and
could
not
fight
so
he
left
me
to
find
my
partner
to
buy
his
old
woman
back
again
i
never
refused
to
sell
a
nigger
i
had
won
if
any
one
would
give
me
anything
near
the
value
and
i
never
had
any
use
for
old
nigger
women
the
gambler
disguised
i
started
out
one
night
on
the
this
boat
left
new
orleans
about
in
the
evening
after
supper
i
opened
monte
there
were
some
rough
customers
from
greenville
and
i
knew
if
they
lost
their
money
there
would
be
the
devil
to
pay
but
i
took
the
chances
and
caught
some
of
them
for
a
few
hundred
dollars
and
there
were
some
two
or
three
of
the
passengers
who
also
lost
after
the
greenville
killers
had
lost
their
money
they
commenced
to
fill
up
and
i
knew
there
would
be
war
soon
i
closed
up
slipped
around
and
got
on
another
suit
of
clothes
put
on
my
plug
hat
and
gold
glasses
then
i
gave
my
valise
to
the
porter
and
told
him
to
have
it
ready
to
go
off
at
donaldsonville
i
walked
out
in
the
cabin
they
were
all
standing
by
the
bar
holding
a
consultation
how
they
could
get
the
money
back
one
said
the
first
time
the
boat
stops
he
will
get
off
well
if
he
does
he
is
a
good
one
for
i
will
fill
his
hide
full
of
lead
if
he
tries
that
says
another
the
boat
blew
her
whistle
to
land
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
them
break
for
the
lower
deck
gun
in
hand
i
walked
out
through
the
cabin
with
my
plug
hat
white
necktie
and
gold
glasses
you
would
have
bet
i
was
a
preacher
you
ought
to
have
seen
those
fellows
make
room
for
me
to
pass
by
my
partner
remained
on
board
as
they
were
not
on
to
him
i
got
a
boat
soon
after
and
went
to
baton
rouge
where
my
partner
was
waiting
for
me
he
said
they
raised
the
d
after
i
got
off
married
his
money
i
was
on
board
the
steamer
going
up
the
river
and
had
got
my
work
in
and
what
money
i
had
accumulated
was
at
poker
we
landed
at
natchez
and
most
all
that
were
playing
in
the
game
got
off
after
supper
i
was
sitting
on
the
guards
smoking
when
a
man
came
up
and
commenced
conversation
about
gambling
he
said
i
love
to
gamble
but
my
wife
is
bitterly
opposed
to
it
i
did
want
to
play
in
that
game
but
i
dare
not
as
i
have
my
family
on
board
so
if
you
play
i
want
to
sit
in
well
i
guess
that
we
may
make
up
a
game
after
it
gets
later
i
said
about
two
hours
after
supper
he
came
out
and
proposed
a
game
i
asked
the
barkeeper
to
pull
out
a
table
and
put
the
checks
and
a
deck
of
cards
on
it
which
he
did
i
could
see
that
this
man
was
crazy
for
a
game
so
i
told
him
to
sit
down
at
the
table
and
to
ask
every
man
that
came
by
the
bar
to
play
and
he
did
so
presently
my
partner
came
up
to
the
bar
and
he
got
the
invitation
so
he
sat
in
they
counted
the
checks
and
got
all
ready
when
i
dropped
in
then
we
had
a
nice
game
and
as
we
were
all
class
gentlemen
there
could
not
be
anything
wrong
i
wanted
to
play
along
until
the
passengers
got
thinned
out
a
little
as
they
were
too
thick
about
the
table
to
suit
me
and
then
my
friend
wanted
his
wife
to
get
to
bed
before
he
started
in
everything
was
going
on
beautifully
and
i
had
not
given
my
man
a
hand
to
see
if
he
had
any
blood
in
him
but
presently
he
got
a
hand
on
the
square
and
i
knew
i
could
beat
him
before
the
draw
so
i
slashed
it
at
him
pretty
lively
but
no
big
bets
and
he
staid
like
a
man
when
it
came
to
the
draw
he
filled
his
hand
and
i
did
not
it
was
my
partner
age
and
the
man
first
bet
he
bet
and
i
told
him
to
take
the
pot
i
had
got
in
before
the
draw
about
then
i
knew
he
was
a
darling
sucker
and
i
nursed
him
like
a
baby
we
played
a
hand
or
two
then
i
ran
him
up
three
aces
and
took
four
nines
pat
i
did
not
want
my
partner
to
raise
it
too
much
before
the
draw
for
fear
he
would
drop
out
we
had
up
about
it
was
my
deal
and
i
asked
him
how
many
cards
he
wanted
he
took
two
i
said
i
will
only
take
one
my
partner
took
three
as
he
had
nothing
but
had
to
stay
in
to
cross
lift
he
tipped
his
hand
to
the
man
and
the
gentleman
bet
i
just
called
the
bet
so
my
partner
bet
better
and
the
gentleman
tore
his
pockets
getting
at
his
money
and
he
called
the
bet
so
i
said
boys
i
expect
you
have
got
me
beat
but
i
will
have
to
raise
you
back
that
made
my
partner
throw
down
his
hand
then
it
was
between
him
and
myself
he
said
to
me
i
know
i
ought
to
raise
it
but
will
just
call
the
bet
when
i
showed
down
four
nines
it
made
him
lie
quiet
we
were
just
getting
ready
to
give
the
boy
another
hand
when
his
wife
came
out
into
the
hall
and
made
him
quit
and
go
to
bed
i
was
sorry
to
see
such
an
angel
leave
the
game
but
such
is
luck
i
found
out
that
he
was
very
rich
but
had
married
the
money
the
best
looking
sucker
i
was
on
board
the
steamer
from
louisville
to
new
orleans
and
she
was
crowded
with
passengers
i
knew
all
the
officers
and
they
were
glad
to
see
me
as
they
knew
i
would
make
it
lively
while
i
was
with
them
i
opened
a
few
bottles
of
wine
and
finally
i
called
them
all
in
off
the
guards
and
opened
up
monte
i
explained
the
game
to
them
my
partner
stepped
up
and
looked
at
it
for
some
time
and
at
last
he
bet
me
and
lost
it
he
then
took
up
one
of
my
cards
and
bent
up
the
corner
then
showed
it
to
the
best
looking
sucker
that
was
standing
by
then
he
turned
to
me
as
he
threw
it
down
and
said
please
mix
them
up
once
more
so
i
threw
them
over
again
and
then
i
was
ready
for
a
bet
he
pulled
out
his
money
and
put
it
up
in
the
gentleman
hand
that
he
had
picked
out
for
the
solid
one
i
said
how
much
have
you
got
there
he
said
i
put
up
the
money
and
at
the
same
time
i
said
i
will
make
it
if
you
wish
i
have
not
got
the
money
or
i
would
he
turned
the
card
over
and
won
then
he
wanted
to
bet
but
i
told
him
whenever
i
get
beat
i
never
want
to
bet
with
the
same
man
again
then
the
gentleman
spoke
up
and
said
i
will
try
you
once
for
i
said
i
would
not
bet
less
than
so
by
a
little
persuasion
he
laid
it
up
and
lost
he
walked
off
and
i
never
saw
him
again
about
the
table
i
played
a
short
time
longer
and
took
in
a
few
hundred
dollars
and
then
closed
up
for
the
evening
my
cards
the
first
trip
the
steamer
made
i
was
on
board
there
were
five
games
of
poker
running
at
one
time
in
the
cabin
i
was
invited
into
one
and
i
represented
myself
as
a
horseman
i
played
on
the
square
as
i
wanted
to
gain
their
confidence
so
when
the
game
closed
for
the
night
they
all
thought
me
a
square
man
after
all
my
new
friends
had
retired
to
their
little
beds
i
got
out
six
decks
of
my
marked
cards
and
went
to
the
bar
i
told
the
barkeeper
what
i
wanted
but
he
objected
as
he
did
not
own
the
bar
and
was
afraid
it
would
be
found
out
and
then
he
would
be
discharged
i
told
him
that
no
one
but
old
gamblers
could
detect
the
marks
and
not
one
in
fifty
of
them
as
it
was
my
own
private
mark
i
had
been
a
good
customer
at
the
new
bar
so
the
new
barkeeper
finally
consented
to
take
my
cards
and
send
them
to
the
table
where
i
would
be
playing
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
the
games
were
started
and
my
new
friends
wanted
me
to
sit
in
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
when
the
barkeeper
put
the
checks
and
cards
on
the
table
i
saw
my
old
friends
i
mean
the
cards
the
game
was
and
it
was
pretty
hard
to
keep
the
run
of
all
the
hands
but
i
quit
the
game
a
few
hundred
dollars
winner
after
the
game
one
of
the
gentlemen
came
to
me
and
said
i
do
like
a
game
suppose
we
split
up
and
make
two
games
that
was
just
what
i
wanted
provided
i
could
get
in
the
game
that
had
the
most
suckers
so
i
said
to
him
i
do
not
care
to
play
if
you
gentlemen
can
make
up
your
game
without
me
but
as
we
are
all
going
through
to
new
orleans
i
will
play
a
little
to
pass
the
time
you
can
arrange
the
games
to
suit
yourselves
and
can
count
me
in
if
you
are
short
a
man
the
gentlemen
arranged
two
nice
games
with
me
in
one
of
them
i
had
no
partner
so
i
had
to
depend
entirely
on
myself
and
my
old
friends
the
marks
on
the
back
we
played
until
the
engines
were
stopped
at
the
landing
in
new
orleans
and
i
was
ahead
i
might
have
won
a
great
deal
more
with
the
assistance
of
a
good
partner
but
then
you
know
i
would
have
had
to
divide
with
him
so
i
was
very
well
pleased
with
my
last
day
on
the
new
steamer
i
did
not
forget
the
new
barkeeper
but
gave
him
for
using
my
cards
at
one
of
the
tables
in
place
of
his
own
fight
with
a
a
big
fellow
tackled
me
by
the
name
of
barlow
he
was
a
shoreman
and
a
tough
one
but
i
did
him
up
in
seventeen
minutes
he
came
into
a
saloon
where
i
was
in
company
with
bill
leonard
and
bob
johnson
leonard
is
well
known
having
kept
stables
in
new
orleans
and
cincinnati
for
many
years
i
had
given
races
that
day
and
it
appears
that
this
man
barlow
had
lost
some
money
five
or
six
toughs
entered
the
saloon
with
barlow
he
approached
johnson
and
said
to
him
you
throwed
that
race
you
s
of
a
b
and
i
am
going
to
lick
you
for
it
he
cut
loose
and
hit
johnson
and
he
must
have
hit
him
pretty
hard
for
he
knocked
him
clear
into
the
street
as
johnson
was
getting
up
an
officer
ran
up
to
him
when
johnson
cut
loose
and
knocked
him
down
thinking
it
was
barlow
they
arrested
johnson
and
took
him
off
then
barlow
turned
to
me
and
said
you
keep
the
race
track
and
you
are
as
big
a
thief
as
that
other
fellow
you
whipped
a
good
man
when
you
whipped
fitzgerald
but
you
ca
whip
barlow
i
looked
around
to
see
how
many
friends
he
had
with
him
and
i
saw
there
were
six
or
seven
and
only
leonard
on
my
side
who
turned
the
key
in
the
door
jumped
on
the
counter
pulled
his
pistol
and
said
gentlemen
if
these
men
fight
they
shall
have
it
on
the
square
and
the
first
one
that
interferes
i
will
fill
him
full
of
lead
so
at
it
we
went
he
was
a
good
scienced
man
and
had
his
hands
up
very
quick
he
made
a
feint
to
strike
me
with
his
left
and
let
go
with
his
right
i
gave
him
my
head
for
a
mark
which
he
hit
clearly
and
his
fist
looked
like
a
boxing
glove
two
minutes
afterward
i
ran
under
his
guard
caught
him
under
the
arms
and
downed
him
in
the
squabble
i
got
one
solid
crack
at
him
between
the
eyes
with
my
head
which
ended
the
fight
he
just
was
able
to
cry
enough
i
did
not
see
him
for
several
weeks
after
that
the
next
time
i
saw
him
was
on
charles
street
he
was
drunk
and
looking
for
me
with
a
big
knife
up
in
his
sleeve
i
saw
him
coming
then
i
grabbed
my
gun
and
stood
pat
i
said
do
come
one
step
more
towards
me
or
i
will
cook
your
goose
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
meant
business
and
walked
off
about
that
time
there
was
a
man
done
for
every
day
in
the
crescent
city
but
now
new
orleans
is
a
moral
place
and
some
of
the
best
people
in
the
world
live
there
do
dye
your
whiskers
we
were
on
board
the
steamer
one
day
when
i
thought
there
were
no
suckers
aboard
i
had
looked
around
and
had
about
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
would
not
make
our
expenses
when
i
saw
a
large
fellow
who
had
his
whiskers
dyed
black
as
ink
i
got
into
conversation
with
him
and
we
walked
around
over
the
boat
and
finally
up
on
the
roof
bob
whitney
was
at
the
wheel
and
his
partner
bill
horricks
was
with
him
in
the
house
i
knew
the
boys
were
all
right
so
i
invited
my
new
acquaintance
to
go
up
as
we
could
see
better
than
on
the
roof
he
accepted
the
invitation
and
we
were
soon
enjoying
the
scenery
i
threw
some
of
my
cards
on
the
floor
under
the
seat
the
gentleman
noticed
them
in
a
little
while
picked
them
up
and
turning
to
me
he
said
if
we
had
a
full
deck
we
could
have
a
game
i
told
him
i
hardly
ever
played
but
i
saw
a
fellow
playing
a
game
with
three
cards
that
beat
anything
i
ever
saw
but
it
took
a
smart
one
to
play
it
i
began
throwing
them
when
bob
whitney
got
so
interested
that
he
came
near
letting
the
boat
run
away
with
him
he
wanted
to
bet
me
fifty
dollars
and
he
told
bill
horricks
to
hold
the
boat
until
he
could
make
a
bet
i
told
him
i
did
not
understand
the
game
well
enough
to
bet
on
it
about
this
time
the
capper
put
in
an
appearance
and
he
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
game
i
explained
it
and
he
made
the
usual
bets
the
pilot
wanted
to
bet
very
bad
but
i
kept
refusing
finally
my
friend
with
the
black
whiskers
got
worked
up
to
and
lost
it
then
my
partner
put
a
mark
on
the
winner
and
beat
me
out
of
the
sucker
saw
the
mark
on
the
card
and
wanted
to
bet
he
was
sure
of
winning
but
he
did
not
want
to
win
but
so
i
took
his
bet
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
turn
the
card
i
said
i
will
make
it
but
he
only
wanted
the
hundred
dollars
and
he
got
it
after
winning
the
and
seeing
the
mark
still
on
the
card
he
thought
it
was
all
his
way
so
he
put
up
i
saw
it
was
about
all
he
had
so
i
put
up
and
he
turned
the
marked
card
but
it
was
not
the
winner
for
so
much
as
it
had
been
for
he
walked
out
of
the
and
went
down
on
deck
my
partner
followed
him
after
they
were
gone
bob
whitney
said
he
would
have
turned
the
same
card
then
bill
horricks
laughed
and
told
him
he
could
hold
a
steamboat
but
he
could
not
beat
devol
at
his
own
game
i
went
down
to
the
bar
and
there
was
my
friend
talking
to
my
partner
i
invited
them
to
join
me
which
they
did
and
then
the
gentleman
said
he
would
like
to
speak
to
me
a
moment
we
walked
out
on
the
guards
when
he
said
to
me
i
know
i
am
a
fool
but
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
and
i
want
you
to
be
candid
with
me
why
did
you
pick
me
out
from
among
all
the
passengers
for
a
sucker
well
i
said
i
will
be
honest
with
you
do
you
dye
your
whiskers
yes
said
he
well
that
is
the
reason
i
picked
you
out
he
said
i
thank
you
sir
and
walked
off
i
went
into
the
cabin
and
opened
up
again
i
caught
a
few
suckers
and
then
closed
up
monte
i
then
got
out
my
wheel
and
took
in
all
the
after
closing
up
for
the
evening
i
walked
into
the
bar
and
there
i
met
a
fine
looking
gentleman
who
asked
me
to
take
a
drink
at
the
same
time
saying
do
you
think
shaving
off
my
whiskers
has
improved
my
looks
i
told
him
there
was
not
as
much
deception
in
him
as
there
had
been
in
the
card
with
the
pencil
mark
on
it
we
took
another
drink
and
separated
i
with
about
of
his
money
and
he
with
the
experience
called
a
gambler
i
was
coming
from
new
orleans
on
the
of
at
one
time
and
had
won
a
few
hundred
dollars
from
some
of
the
passengers
but
had
quit
playing
and
was
standing
in
the
hall
talking
to
some
gentlemen
that
had
played
in
the
game
when
a
big
fellow
stepped
up
and
said
he
believed
we
were
a
set
of
gamblers
and
had
divided
the
money
he
lost
in
the
game
i
gave
him
the
laugh
and
that
made
him
hot
he
then
pulled
off
his
coat
and
said
he
could
whip
any
man
in
the
crowd
and
he
kept
his
eye
on
me
all
the
time
i
told
him
i
could
lick
him
for
fifty
or
one
hundred
dollars
in
a
fair
fight
down
on
deck
he
said
if
any
one
would
see
he
had
a
fair
show
he
would
fight
me
the
mate
asked
me
if
i
was
going
to
fight
him
i
said
yes
so
he
told
the
big
fellow
he
was
an
officer
on
the
boat
and
that
no
one
would
interfere
if
he
wanted
to
fight
so
he
put
up
his
fifty
dollars
in
the
hand
and
i
covered
it
for
those
days
i
would
rather
fight
than
eat
and
i
could
fight
for
a
man
life
we
went
on
deck
and
they
cleared
a
place
for
us
while
this
was
going
on
i
offered
to
bet
him
fifty
or
a
hundred
dollars
more
that
i
would
make
him
squeal
he
said
he
had
no
more
money
to
put
up
we
stripped
off
and
got
in
the
place
prepared
for
us
he
struck
at
me
with
one
of
those
dutch
winders
i
ducked
my
head
and
he
hit
that
i
knew
it
hurt
him
for
he
did
not
use
that
duke
any
more
i
got
in
under
him
let
fly
with
my
head
and
caught
him
square
in
the
face
it
made
him
grunt
but
the
next
time
i
got
one
in
on
him
i
made
him
look
silly
for
the
blood
came
out
of
his
ears
and
nose
he
said
will
do
the
mate
took
him
up
stairs
and
had
the
barber
wash
and
patch
him
up
i
changed
my
clothes
as
they
were
covered
with
the
blood
i
asked
all
hands
to
take
a
drink
and
my
man
came
up
and
joined
us
i
then
paid
the
bar
bill
and
gave
him
back
the
balance
of
the
fifty
dollars
i
won
from
him
on
the
fight
he
claimed
that
it
was
his
first
whipping
but
he
could
not
stand
the
old
head
it
was
too
hard
for
him
i
have
had
a
great
many
fights
in
my
day
there
was
a
fellow
tackled
me
on
the
levee
in
new
orleans
at
one
time
when
i
was
all
alone
and
he
had
a
lot
of
his
friends
with
him
i
got
him
down
and
was
getting
the
best
of
him
when
some
of
his
friends
began
kicking
me
pretty
lively
i
guess
i
would
have
been
licked
that
time
if
it
had
not
been
for
some
men
on
a
ship
who
saw
too
many
on
one
so
they
came
to
my
assistance
and
then
i
made
the
fellow
squeal
in
a
short
time
they
had
it
in
for
me
for
a
long
time
but
finally
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
and
i
was
glad
of
it
as
i
never
wanted
to
kill
a
man
which
i
expect
i
would
have
done
if
they
had
not
let
me
alone
the
alligators
i
went
up
on
the
my
old
friend
truman
holmes
was
the
captain
of
her
i
was
standing
on
the
hurricane
deck
when
we
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
red
river
to
take
in
some
passengers
i
saw
the
negroes
carrying
some
long
boxes
built
like
i
asked
captain
holmes
what
was
in
the
boxes
he
said
alligators
so
i
went
down
stairs
and
found
the
man
that
owned
them
i
took
him
up
to
the
bar
and
had
a
drink
then
i
asked
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
the
alligators
he
said
he
had
a
and
he
was
going
to
play
the
fairs
all
over
the
entire
northern
country
and
he
wanted
them
to
draw
custom
i
told
him
i
thought
it
an
excellent
idea
and
said
i
have
a
wolf
in
a
cage
that
i
will
get
on
board
at
vicksburg
and
i
will
sell
him
cheap
this
pleased
him
and
we
took
another
drink
i
insisted
on
paying
for
the
drinks
but
he
would
not
consent
so
we
got
to
be
good
friends
after
supper
we
got
to
playing
whisky
poker
as
i
told
him
i
never
gambled
much
only
once
in
a
while
as
planters
would
play
a
quarter
antee
he
insisted
on
changing
it
into
a
little
draw
and
as
i
had
some
very
good
cards
in
the
bar
i
was
not
hard
to
coax
we
commenced
at
a
quarter
antee
and
after
we
had
been
playing
about
an
hour
he
insisted
on
raising
it
to
he
flattered
me
more
than
i
ever
was
flattered
before
in
telling
me
i
was
the
luckiest
man
to
draw
he
ever
saw
the
result
was
before
we
reached
natchez
i
had
won
all
his
money
and
his
alligators
but
he
took
it
so
much
to
heart
about
losing
his
pets
that
i
sold
them
back
to
him
and
took
his
note
it
is
now
older
than
the
daguerrotype
man
and
when
i
hand
in
my
checks
i
will
leave
the
notes
with
my
dear
old
for
collection
control
over
suckers
i
was
playing
euchre
one
night
on
the
old
and
had
a
good
sucker
down
in
the
game
and
the
clerk
was
watching
us
very
close
so
after
i
gave
the
sucker
a
good
hand
and
he
wanted
to
bet
on
poker
i
whispered
and
said
if
we
make
a
bet
we
must
put
the
money
in
a
hat
and
we
must
not
speak
about
betting
louder
than
in
a
whisper
we
had
up
when
i
saw
the
clerk
coming
i
grabbed
the
hat
and
threw
down
my
hand
when
the
clerk
got
there
the
bird
had
flown
he
told
the
captain
it
was
all
foolishness
in
trying
to
keep
those
gamblers
from
winning
a
sucker
money
for
they
could
make
a
sucker
whisper
or
do
anything
they
wanted
him
to
do
so
that
made
two
good
men
out
of
the
captain
and
the
clerk
for
they
never
interfered
with
our
innocent
games
after
that
and
we
made
many
a
dollar
on
that
boat
she
was
a
nice
steamboat
to
travel
on
in
those
days
but
they
got
to
building
them
so
much
finer
that
a
sucker
was
afraid
to
go
on
board
one
of
them
thinking
that
they
would
charge
him
more
money
nipped
in
the
bud
i
went
on
board
the
late
one
night
and
as
i
had
been
up
all
the
night
before
i
got
a
room
and
went
to
bed
i
saw
some
gamblers
playing
in
the
cabin
as
i
went
through
but
i
was
too
tired
to
notice
them
much
i
had
not
been
in
my
bed
long
until
i
heard
a
racket
out
in
the
cabin
i
peeped
out
and
soon
understood
what
was
up
some
one
had
lost
his
money
and
was
doing
the
grand
kicking
act
i
got
up
and
was
into
my
clothes
in
double
quick
time
and
out
among
them
with
old
betsy
jane
in
my
pocket
i
soon
learned
that
a
contractor
on
the
levee
who
had
a
lot
of
men
down
on
deck
had
lost
his
money
playing
poker
with
one
of
the
gamblers
and
he
was
going
to
have
it
back
or
he
would
bring
up
his
men
and
take
it
by
force
i
told
the
gambler
to
stand
his
ground
and
not
give
up
a
red
the
barkeeper
told
me
the
kicker
had
sent
down
for
some
of
his
men
to
come
up
so
i
started
for
the
stairs
and
met
the
contractor
in
the
hall
waiting
for
them
i
asked
him
what
was
the
difficulty
he
said
that
was
his
business
then
i
said
to
him
you
are
one
of
those
d
d
scoundrels
who
try
to
beat
others
out
of
their
money
and
kick
like
h
l
when
they
get
the
worst
of
anything
he
did
not
want
to
say
anything
until
his
gang
was
at
his
back
and
they
were
then
coming
up
i
ran
out
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
with
old
betsy
jane
in
my
hand
and
ordered
them
to
stop
they
did
stop
for
i
had
her
pulled
down
on
them
and
the
other
gamblers
were
standing
by
me
i
said
the
first
man
that
takes
another
step
to
come
up
these
stairs
will
get
hurt
they
did
come
then
i
turned
to
the
kicker
and
told
him
if
he
made
a
move
i
would
cook
his
goose
he
saw
we
meant
business
and
weakened
the
gang
went
back
to
their
bunks
the
kicking
contractor
went
to
his
room
and
we
held
the
fort
i
was
told
that
the
same
man
had
lost
his
money
about
a
year
previous
while
playing
poker
with
john
deming
and
he
brought
his
men
up
threw
deming
down
and
did
not
only
take
the
money
he
lost
but
a
large
amount
besides
i
had
the
same
thing
tried
on
me
once
so
when
i
saw
a
imposed
upon
i
went
to
the
front
besides
if
we
let
such
a
thing
go
too
far
it
would
ruin
our
business
so
i
thought
it
was
best
to
nip
it
in
the
bud
the
big
sucker
we
were
out
from
new
orleans
with
captain
bill
harrison
one
day
on
board
the
steamer
and
was
having
a
good
game
of
roulette
when
we
noticed
that
most
of
the
fish
were
suckers
and
did
not
bite
so
well
at
roulette
so
we
changed
our
tackle
and
used
monte
for
bait
we
were
fishing
along
and
had
caught
some
pretty
good
fish
but
none
of
the
large
ones
we
saw
about
the
hooks
every
time
we
would
get
one
of
them
to
come
up
and
begin
nibbling
around
something
would
scare
him
away
we
put
on
fresh
bait
spit
on
it
and
threw
it
out
with
all
the
care
that
we
were
capable
of
but
somehow
or
another
they
would
not
suck
in
the
hook
i
knew
the
bait
was
good
for
i
had
caught
thousands
of
suckers
with
it
and
i
could
see
that
there
was
plenty
of
that
kind
of
fish
around
us
i
began
looking
and
soon
discovered
the
trouble
it
was
a
great
big
old
sucker
who
wanted
to
be
a
kind
of
teacher
over
the
school
for
every
time
one
of
the
young
suckers
would
get
up
too
close
he
would
pull
his
tail
and
that
would
scare
the
young
one
so
he
would
not
take
hold
in
earnest
i
watched
the
big
sucker
for
some
time
and
i
saw
it
was
no
use
trying
to
catch
anything
until
i
caught
the
old
school
teacher
so
i
put
up
my
tackle
and
began
looking
for
a
bait
that
would
land
the
old
one
i
was
walking
on
the
guards
when
i
saw
the
man
that
had
and
spoiled
my
game
i
went
up
to
him
and
entered
into
conversation
i
did
not
let
him
know
i
was
mad
but
i
was
all
the
same
and
would
have
given
to
give
him
one
between
the
eyes
but
i
soon
thought
of
a
plan
to
make
him
contribute
a
part
of
what
he
had
kept
me
from
winning
so
i
said
to
him
i
was
surprised
to
see
you
capping
my
game
for
i
could
see
you
were
a
sporting
man
i
tried
to
give
you
the
wink
and
have
you
come
up
and
win
out
something
so
the
suckers
would
take
hold
but
i
could
not
get
your
eye
he
said
i
did
not
understand
it
or
i
would
have
been
glad
to
help
you
i
told
him
that
after
dinner
i
would
open
up
again
and
for
him
to
walk
up
and
make
a
good
big
bet
and
i
would
let
him
win
then
for
him
to
walk
away
and
i
would
catch
all
the
suckers
on
the
boat
after
all
had
been
arranged
i
went
to
my
room
and
got
old
betsy
jane
for
my
new
capper
had
one
on
him
so
long
that
it
stuck
down
below
his
i
told
my
partner
to
look
out
for
the
big
gun
and
our
new
capper
i
called
the
passengers
around
a
table
and
began
to
throw
the
hooks
up
came
the
big
fish
and
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
least
bet
i
would
take
i
told
him
he
planked
her
up
when
i
saw
about
left
so
i
told
him
i
would
make
it
he
put
up
the
extra
for
of
course
the
more
he
put
up
the
more
he
would
win
as
he
was
to
suck
in
the
hook
with
the
extra
kink
in
it
i
gave
them
a
little
mixing
and
said
ready
he
darted
in
and
nabbed
the
bait
more
like
a
than
a
sucker
but
he
was
caught
all
the
same
he
did
not
swim
away
as
he
had
been
told
to
do
for
he
was
held
by
a
line
that
cost
him
and
he
could
not
break
it
without
a
great
struggle
i
thought
i
had
let
him
play
about
long
enough
so
i
said
gentlemen
there
are
no
more
suckers
to
be
caught
on
this
boat
and
thus
landed
the
biggest
sucker
i
ever
caught
in
all
my
life
i
put
up
my
fishing
tackle
and
invited
all
hands
to
the
bar
for
i
was
feeling
like
all
fishermen
a
little
dry
my
big
sucker
joined
us
as
he
had
been
out
of
water
just
long
enough
to
want
to
get
back
after
we
had
quenched
our
thirst
he
said
he
would
like
to
see
me
a
minute
i
told
him
he
could
see
me
for
an
hour
as
i
had
no
other
business
to
look
after
we
walked
out
on
the
guards
and
my
partner
was
not
far
away
the
big
fellow
said
to
me
why
did
you
let
me
win
the
money
i
looked
up
at
him
but
kept
my
hand
on
old
betsy
jane
and
said
my
business
is
to
catch
suckers
and
you
are
the
biggest
one
i
ever
caught
in
my
life
if
you
think
i
will
give
you
back
your
money
he
went
back
for
his
gun
but
i
had
old
betsy
out
and
up
to
his
head
before
he
could
say
jack
robinson
i
told
him
to
put
up
his
hands
and
be
d
d
quick
about
it
too
he
put
them
up
and
said
he
did
not
want
any
gun
to
whip
such
a
fellow
as
i
was
i
told
him
that
he
might
be
a
good
man
down
in
texas
where
he
came
from
but
he
was
a
sucker
up
in
this
country
and
i
could
eat
him
up
i
said
we
will
put
our
guns
in
the
bar
and
have
it
out
just
as
you
like
it
we
went
in
the
bar
and
he
handed
over
his
young
cannon
and
then
i
put
up
betsy
jane
i
told
my
partner
to
get
the
captain
and
tell
him
to
land
the
boat
and
he
would
see
some
fun
for
i
knew
he
would
rather
see
a
fight
than
eat
when
he
was
hungry
so
just
as
we
got
our
guns
behind
the
bar
the
captain
walked
in
and
some
one
said
here
comes
the
captain
the
texas
fellow
said
to
h
l
with
him
i
do
care
a
d
n
for
any
captain
that
made
old
bill
hot
and
he
wanted
to
know
what
was
all
this
racket
about
i
told
him
the
big
fellow
wanted
to
lick
me
he
said
i
soon
settle
this
you
will
go
ashore
the
big
fellow
said
there
was
not
men
enough
on
the
boat
to
put
him
ashore
the
captain
then
sent
word
to
the
pilot
to
land
and
also
sent
for
the
mate
and
some
of
the
hands
the
pilot
ran
the
boat
up
on
a
point
and
she
got
aground
i
jumped
off
as
soon
as
she
struck
and
the
mate
assisted
by
two
big
soon
had
texas
off
the
passengers
were
all
out
on
the
guards
for
they
had
heard
the
racket
and
wanted
to
see
the
fun
i
pulled
off
my
coat
and
told
texas
to
clean
himself
and
come
he
was
just
as
sure
of
licking
me
as
i
was
of
catching
him
for
a
sucker
but
he
had
forgotten
nothing
is
sure
that
grows
on
earthly
ground
he
was
onto
me
in
an
instant
and
if
he
had
hit
me
just
where
he
aimed
he
would
have
hurt
me
for
he
was
a
hard
hitter
but
i
gave
him
my
dear
old
head
and
he
hurt
himself
very
bad
but
i
did
not
care
if
he
did
i
then
ran
in
under
him
and
had
him
down
on
his
back
before
he
recovered
from
the
blow
he
struck
against
a
rock
as
he
afterward
called
my
head
after
i
got
him
down
i
gave
him
one
just
between
the
eyes
and
he
saw
stars
although
there
were
none
in
the
sky
just
then
i
gave
him
one
more
punch
and
he
said
that
will
do
i
let
him
up
and
he
was
so
dazed
that
he
staggered
and
fell
into
the
river
they
pulled
him
out
and
i
heard
some
one
remark
that
the
biggest
sucker
ever
caught
in
this
river
while
the
fight
was
going
on
they
were
trying
to
get
the
boat
off
the
point
but
i
guess
they
did
not
try
very
hard
for
as
soon
as
they
fished
out
the
sucker
the
captain
called
for
me
to
come
aboard
i
said
captain
it
is
only
three
miles
to
donaldsonville
and
as
i
want
a
little
exercise
i
will
walk
but
take
good
care
of
my
sucker
the
crazy
man
i
was
going
up
the
illinois
river
once
with
dad
ryan
we
did
not
try
to
do
anything
the
first
night
out
from
louis
the
next
day
i
picked
up
a
man
who
had
been
to
louis
with
wild
game
and
butter
and
had
a
great
deal
of
money
for
a
man
of
his
calibre
i
told
him
i
lived
in
galena
and
had
some
of
the
finest
lead
mines
in
that
part
of
the
country
we
got
pretty
well
acquainted
with
each
other
and
had
some
drinks
together
he
got
to
feeling
lively
for
whenever
he
took
a
drink
he
would
take
a
tumbler
half
full
of
whisky
after
getting
him
warmed
up
pretty
well
i
walked
him
in
the
barber
shop
to
see
a
white
squirrel
during
the
while
the
barber
was
after
it
dad
opened
out
the
three
cards
and
my
friend
and
i
had
become
very
interested
in
the
game
i
looked
on
a
while
then
i
said
to
ryan
i
think
i
can
turn
the
winning
card
for
he
accepted
the
proposition
and
i
laid
up
the
money
and
turned
the
wrong
one
i
then
picked
up
the
jack
as
that
was
the
winner
and
bent
the
corner
showed
it
to
my
friend
whispered
and
told
him
not
to
say
a
word
as
he
would
not
detect
its
being
bent
he
said
all
right
i
told
the
dealer
to
throw
them
over
again
which
he
did
i
then
said
i
know
you
have
two
chances
to
our
one
but
i
will
try
you
for
we
put
up
our
money
into
the
butter
man
hands
and
i
turned
the
card
the
dealer
told
the
butter
man
that
he
lost
fair
and
to
give
the
money
to
me
then
i
wanted
to
try
it
for
the
but
he
would
not
bet
with
me
saying
when
a
man
beats
me
once
i
will
not
bet
with
him
again
so
i
handed
the
money
to
my
friend
and
told
him
to
bet
it
for
me
that
will
do
said
ryan
he
mixed
them
up
again
and
my
friend
turned
the
card
and
won
for
me
ryan
took
it
very
pleasantly
laughing
all
the
time
so
my
friend
thought
he
would
try
it
with
his
own
money
but
ryan
said
you
beat
me
once
and
you
know
what
i
said
well
said
my
friend
i
did
not
bet
for
myself
i
coaxed
ryan
to
let
him
bet
as
he
was
entitled
to
one
bet
at
least
he
consented
and
my
friend
got
out
but
ryan
said
no
i
will
not
bet
less
than
i
said
to
my
friend
if
you
have
not
got
the
money
i
will
loan
it
to
you
and
if
you
only
win
one
small
bet
he
will
not
bet
with
you
again
he
pulled
out
a
big
roll
with
a
string
around
it
and
counted
out
more
and
laid
it
on
the
table
i
told
him
i
would
hold
the
stakes
so
he
handed
me
the
money
ryan
saw
that
big
roll
and
hated
to
have
him
get
away
as
he
might
quit
after
losing
when
he
saw
that
i
was
holding
stakes
he
said
i
guess
i
will
back
out
i
spoke
up
and
told
him
he
could
not
and
my
friend
said
that
it
was
not
fair
to
back
out
then
said
ryan
i
will
raise
you
and
he
laid
it
up
in
my
hand
then
my
friend
wanted
to
back
out
and
take
his
money
down
but
ryan
would
not
stand
that
i
insisted
on
putting
up
the
rest
but
ryan
would
not
allow
it
as
he
said
i
will
bet
but
one
at
a
time
i
told
him
to
lay
up
the
money
he
put
it
up
at
last
trembling
like
a
man
with
the
palsy
but
finally
he
grabbed
the
card
and
lost
just
about
that
time
there
was
a
little
boat
landed
alongside
of
us
as
we
were
lying
at
a
landing
putting
off
freight
i
gave
ryan
the
office
to
get
on
her
he
slipped
over
on
the
boat
and
the
sucker
just
then
came
to
his
senses
when
he
saw
that
ryan
had
gone
out
he
said
to
me
where
did
he
go
i
told
him
he
had
gone
back
in
the
cabin
so
he
started
back
to
look
for
him
and
while
he
was
gone
the
little
boat
backed
out
i
walked
out
in
the
hall
to
see
what
had
become
of
my
friend
and
found
him
searching
all
the
rooms
in
the
ladies
cabin
he
then
rushed
into
a
room
where
his
wife
was
and
then
there
was
h
l
to
pay
the
man
came
near
shooting
him
but
i
ran
back
and
told
the
gentleman
that
the
fellow
was
crazy
and
did
not
know
what
he
was
doing
he
ran
all
around
the
boat
frothing
at
the
mouth
and
never
said
a
word
to
any
one
finally
some
of
the
officers
grabbed
him
got
a
rope
and
tied
him
for
they
all
thought
he
was
crazy
and
i
commenced
to
think
so
myself
as
all
he
would
say
was
where
is
he
where
did
he
go
no
one
had
seen
the
game
but
the
barber
and
i
slipped
him
a
bill
and
told
him
to
keep
mum
they
kept
the
man
tied
for
about
one
hour
until
he
promised
he
would
behave
if
they
let
him
loose
which
they
did
he
sat
perfectly
still
and
did
not
have
a
word
to
say
i
knew
he
was
not
broke
for
i
saw
he
had
about
left
and
that
amount
together
with
his
late
experience
was
capital
enough
for
any
man
did
win
the
key
we
were
playing
monte
on
board
the
steamer
out
of
new
orleans
one
night
and
had
a
very
lively
game
we
had
won
a
few
hundred
dollars
there
was
a
jew
on
board
who
had
no
money
but
he
had
a
fine
watch
during
the
play
he
was
very
anxious
to
bet
it
but
i
told
him
i
did
not
want
to
play
for
his
watch
as
i
knew
i
could
win
it
whenever
i
saw
fit
so
just
as
the
game
was
about
to
close
i
said
to
him
what
is
your
watch
worth
three
hundred
dollars
and
i
can
get
that
for
it
i
told
him
i
would
put
up
against
it
and
bet
him
he
could
not
turn
the
picture
card
he
pulled
out
put
her
up
and
then
turned
over
the
wrong
card
the
passengers
all
laughed
he
never
said
a
word
but
appeared
to
take
it
all
right
after
a
while
he
came
to
me
and
said
i
have
the
key
and
would
like
you
to
keep
the
watch
wound
up
as
i
think
a
great
deal
of
it
and
as
soon
as
we
get
to
natchez
i
can
borrow
the
money
on
the
from
charley
frazier
to
redeem
it
when
he
spoke
in
that
way
i
handed
him
his
ticker
and
he
ran
away
with
it
i
laughed
and
began
thinking
how
to
get
it
back
again
so
i
took
my
partner
alexander
to
one
side
and
told
him
to
get
in
with
the
jew
then
tell
him
he
heard
me
say
i
was
going
to
give
the
watch
back
tell
him
you
have
been
watching
me
play
and
that
you
believed
you
could
play
it
as
well
as
the
man
he
played
against
he
got
in
with
him
and
finally
got
some
cards
to
show
the
jew
how
i
played
the
jew
got
very
much
taken
with
the
game
again
so
he
said
to
my
partner
i
know
that
i
could
beat
you
if
you
will
play
for
something
so
he
won
the
drinks
and
cigars
from
my
partner
and
at
last
he
wanted
to
put
up
his
watch
against
that
he
could
turn
the
card
my
partner
put
up
the
money
and
the
jew
the
watch
but
he
missed
it
that
time
and
you
never
did
hear
such
laughter
as
there
was
on
that
boat
for
the
passengers
all
turned
loose
and
plagued
the
poor
jew
all
the
way
up
to
natchez
asking
him
what
time
it
was
he
did
not
redeem
it
at
natchez
so
i
had
to
buy
a
key
and
that
nearly
broke
my
heart
was
in
with
the
judge
i
was
on
the
train
from
jackson
to
new
orleans
i
opened
in
the
smoking
car
and
won
a
good
deal
of
money
we
were
just
coming
to
a
station
called
amite
about
sixty
miles
above
new
orleans
i
waited
until
the
car
got
in
motion
after
learning
the
station
as
i
did
not
want
to
go
into
new
orleans
for
they
were
kicking
like
the
d
and
i
knew
there
would
be
a
big
crowd
at
the
depot
i
slipped
off
and
told
my
partner
to
bring
my
valise
and
come
up
the
next
day
they
went
into
the
city
kicking
like
steers
and
they
had
the
officers
looking
for
me
but
they
did
not
find
me
two
of
them
took
the
train
and
came
back
to
amite
that
night
and
in
the
morning
when
i
came
to
breakfast
there
they
were
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
them
after
breakfast
they
went
to
the
magistrate
and
swore
out
a
warrant
for
my
arrest
and
the
constable
came
over
to
the
hotel
looking
for
me
but
i
had
skipped
out
i
walked
down
the
railroad
and
kept
hid
until
they
were
satisfied
i
had
gone
they
left
orders
if
i
showed
up
to
have
me
arrested
and
telegraph
them
i
took
the
first
train
and
went
to
the
city
they
came
in
on
the
evening
train
the
next
day
they
found
out
i
was
in
the
city
and
then
i
was
arrested
and
brought
before
the
recorder
court
when
the
judge
asked
me
if
i
had
an
attorney
i
told
him
i
could
plead
my
own
case
i
soon
convinced
him
that
the
gambling
was
done
in
another
parish
and
i
was
discharged
they
then
took
a
train
and
went
back
got
the
warrant
they
had
out
for
me
and
brought
an
officer
with
them
the
officer
stepped
up
to
me
and
said
i
have
a
warrant
for
you
all
right
but
we
ca
leave
here
until
night
let
us
pass
away
the
time
until
the
train
leaves
there
was
a
big
crowd
followed
us
to
get
a
look
at
the
notorious
devol
and
the
officer
kept
pulling
out
the
warrant
and
showing
it
to
the
throng
he
was
getting
pretty
full
of
whisky
when
i
saw
a
thief
in
the
crowd
i
gave
him
the
wink
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
he
had
the
warrant
i
got
one
of
my
friends
to
ask
the
officer
to
show
him
the
warrant
he
dove
down
in
his
pocket
but
could
not
find
it
so
i
told
him
he
must
have
the
paper
or
i
would
not
go
with
him
it
sobered
him
up
and
the
last
time
i
saw
him
he
was
with
the
two
fellows
going
to
the
train
to
get
fresh
papers
i
went
up
myself
to
see
what
they
could
do
with
me
i
took
a
train
and
passed
them
coming
down
they
went
into
the
city
and
found
that
i
had
left
for
amite
that
morning
and
that
they
had
missed
me
when
i
got
there
i
took
the
judge
and
prosecutor
out
and
we
had
several
drinks
then
we
went
to
a
shoe
shop
and
ordered
two
pairs
of
boots
for
them
and
took
the
size
of
their
heads
and
sent
to
new
orleans
for
hats
when
they
came
back
and
the
case
was
called
the
judge
heard
their
story
and
then
mine
and
decided
it
was
nothing
but
a
case
of
gambling
and
that
he
would
have
to
fine
us
each
five
dollars
and
costs
we
paid
our
fines
and
they
all
took
the
train
that
day
but
myself
i
stayed
a
day
or
two
and
had
a
fishing
game
as
it
was
a
great
place
to
catch
the
little
flappers
they
said
when
they
came
back
to
the
city
that
no
law
down
here
would
do
anything
with
that
fellow
and
his
name
ought
to
be
devil
instead
of
devol
they
thought
i
must
be
some
relation
to
claude
duval
the
highwayman
they
were
vermonters
they
said
if
they
had
me
down
east
they
would
fix
me
for
the
balance
of
my
life
but
i
was
not
down
east
and
i
had
often
been
before
i
met
those
suckers
fixed
for
life
the
brilliant
stone
we
were
on
board
the
steamer
bound
for
new
orleans
there
were
several
planters
aboard
that
i
was
acquainted
with
and
we
were
drinking
wine
telling
stories
and
enjoying
ourselves
when
a
large
gentleman
stepped
up
to
the
bar
and
took
a
drink
he
had
a
diamond
stud
in
his
shirt
that
was
so
large
and
brilliant
that
it
attracted
the
attention
of
us
all
so
after
he
went
out
we
began
commenting
on
it
i
finally
said
to
one
of
the
planters
what
would
you
give
for
that
stone
he
said
i
would
give
for
it
but
i
bet
it
could
not
be
bought
for
the
money
what
will
you
give
me
for
it
i
asked
them
they
all
laughed
for
they
understood
by
my
question
that
i
thought
the
man
was
a
sucker
and
i
could
win
it
from
him
one
of
them
said
devol
you
are
a
good
one
but
that
fellow
is
too
smart
to
be
caught
by
any
of
your
tricks
i
said
gentlemen
i
will
bet
two
bottles
of
wine
that
i
will
have
that
stone
inside
of
an
hour
who
will
take
me
they
all
wanted
to
take
the
bet
and
raise
it
to
a
basket
but
i
told
them
the
odds
were
too
much
in
their
favor
and
i
would
bet
but
two
bottles
so
it
was
settled
that
i
was
to
win
the
stone
or
pay
for
the
wine
then
we
all
went
out
in
the
cabin
and
i
called
everybody
to
join
me
in
some
wine
my
partner
went
up
to
the
man
with
the
brilliant
stone
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
the
man
that
was
treating
he
said
he
did
not
then
my
partner
told
him
that
i
was
a
planter
that
i
owned
six
plantations
and
so
many
niggers
that
i
did
not
know
the
number
myself
the
gentleman
was
introduced
to
me
and
the
other
planters
when
he
said
i
am
very
glad
to
form
the
acquaintance
of
you
southerners
i
a
new
yorker
the
compliment
cost
me
the
wine
for
the
entire
party
while
the
barkeeper
was
serving
the
wine
i
told
him
to
bring
me
some
of
those
tickets
that
they
played
the
whisky
game
with
he
brought
the
tickets
and
i
began
to
mix
them
one
of
the
planters
bet
me
the
wine
that
he
could
turn
the
ticket
with
the
baby
i
took
him
up
and
he
stuck
me
then
another
bet
me
the
cigars
and
i
stuck
him
while
we
were
lighting
our
cigars
my
partner
put
a
pencil
mark
on
the
baby
ticket
and
told
the
new
yorker
that
he
wanted
to
have
some
fun
with
me
that
i
was
so
i
would
take
it
as
a
joke
when
i
found
it
out
i
commenced
mixing
them
again
and
wanted
to
know
who
would
be
the
next
man
to
try
his
luck
my
partner
came
to
the
front
and
wanted
to
know
if
i
would
bet
money
on
the
game
i
told
him
so
long
as
i
had
two
chances
to
his
one
i
would
bet
a
plantation
and
a
hundred
niggers
besides
he
put
up
and
said
i
will
try
you
once
for
i
pulled
out
a
roll
so
large
that
it
made
everybody
look
wild
saying
that
just
suits
me
i
mixed
and
my
partner
turned
the
ticket
with
the
pencil
mark
on
it
and
caught
me
for
i
laughed
and
said
you
a
lucky
fellow
i
want
to
bet
with
you
any
more
he
then
slipped
away
as
though
he
was
afraid
i
would
detect
the
mark
and
raise
a
fuss
he
gave
the
to
one
of
the
planters
and
told
him
to
go
and
play
it
the
planter
came
up
and
said
i
try
you
for
i
said
all
right
plank
her
up
he
turned
a
card
but
not
knowing
anything
about
the
mark
he
lost
i
laughed
and
said
try
it
again
you
not
as
lucky
as
the
other
fellow
no
said
he
i
got
enough
then
my
partner
came
up
again
and
wanted
to
bet
but
i
told
him
he
was
the
lucky
fellow
and
i
was
afraid
of
him
the
new
yorker
could
see
the
mark
on
the
card
and
he
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
so
he
pushed
up
to
the
table
and
laid
down
a
roll
and
said
i
will
bet
you
i
told
him
i
would
only
make
one
more
bet
and
then
quit
and
i
would
bet
or
nothing
he
picked
up
the
money
and
turned
away
my
partner
said
so
i
could
hear
him
bet
him
the
man
said
i
have
not
got
the
money
then
my
partner
offered
to
loan
it
to
him
when
i
told
them
i
would
not
bet
if
the
lucky
fellow
was
in
with
it
but
if
the
gentleman
had
anything
worth
the
money
he
could
put
it
up
the
lucky
fellow
told
him
to
put
up
his
diamond
stud
saying
in
a
whisper
it
is
only
for
a
minute
do
you
see
the
mark
on
the
card
the
gentleman
put
up
the
stone
and
the
i
told
him
i
would
only
take
the
stone
for
then
my
partner
told
him
to
put
up
his
watch
he
did
so
and
i
put
up
in
money
i
mixed
and
he
turned
the
marked
card
he
was
very
much
excited
and
when
the
card
turned
over
it
had
the
mark
on
its
back
but
the
baby
had
crawled
off
the
other
side
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
walked
back
to
his
and
that
was
the
last
we
saw
of
him
as
he
was
walking
away
some
one
called
to
him
to
join
us
in
some
wine
but
he
could
not
hear
so
well
as
when
the
capper
told
him
in
a
whisper
to
put
up
as
it
was
only
for
a
minute
we
looked
at
our
watches
i
had
two
and
it
wanted
just
five
minutes
of
the
hour
the
planter
that
made
the
bet
of
two
bottles
spent
over
for
the
wine
that
night
and
before
he
left
the
boat
he
gave
me
for
the
brilliant
stone
lucky
at
poker
one
night
i
went
out
on
the
steamer
she
was
running
from
memphis
to
new
orleans
captain
hicks
was
the
commander
and
a
jolly
fellow
was
he
he
said
to
me
devol
i
never
saw
a
gambler
in
the
world
that
i
was
afraid
to
play
with
i
am
just
as
smart
as
any
of
them
i
said
captain
you
will
get
no
game
out
of
me
as
i
do
not
want
any
of
your
money
after
supper
i
noticed
the
captain
had
a
man
and
they
went
to
his
room
in
the
texas
i
opened
up
and
had
a
fine
play
at
roulette
but
it
fell
off
at
and
i
closed
up
i
was
sitting
in
the
hall
when
the
captain
and
his
man
came
down
the
man
said
captain
i
am
winner
let
have
a
bottle
of
wine
they
invited
me
to
join
them
the
captain
said
george
i
will
turn
this
gentleman
over
to
you
as
i
ca
beat
him
well
i
said
cap
if
you
beat
him
i
ca
for
you
are
a
better
poker
player
than
i
am
then
i
winked
at
the
barkeeper
who
had
a
few
decks
of
my
cards
that
i
had
put
in
when
i
came
on
board
he
knew
what
i
wanted
i
said
to
the
man
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
play
one
game
of
for
a
bottle
of
wine
as
i
thought
that
was
the
best
way
to
get
him
started
he
agreed
i
said
barkeeper
give
us
a
deck
of
cards
and
we
will
see
who
is
the
lucky
man
we
began
cut
for
deal
and
i
beat
him
i
dealt
and
i
knew
every
card
in
his
hand
he
had
no
trumps
and
i
had
the
jack
alone
he
begged
i
gave
him
one
and
made
four
he
dealt
and
i
made
three
on
his
deal
which
put
me
out
he
was
as
hot
as
a
pepper
pod
but
he
called
for
the
wine
after
we
drank
it
he
said
i
wonder
if
you
are
that
lucky
at
poker
if
so
i
will
try
you
a
little
while
i
said
all
right
i
think
myself
i
am
in
luck
we
went
at
it
but
he
said
the
limit
must
be
we
played
until
daylight
began
to
peep
through
the
skylight
of
the
cabin
and
i
had
to
loan
him
money
to
defray
his
expenses
he
told
the
captain
it
was
the
hardest
game
he
ever
struck
he
sent
me
the
money
i
loaned
him
by
express
and
wrote
that
if
he
ever
met
me
on
the
river
again
he
wanted
to
be
in
with
my
play
it
was
not
long
after
that
when
i
met
him
on
the
steamer
and
we
made
some
big
money
together
as
he
got
up
some
fine
games
with
the
planters
he
was
known
all
along
the
river
and
captain
leathers
thought
it
strange
to
see
him
playing
with
me
but
the
gentleman
understood
it
for
i
was
always
lucky
at
poker
the
hidden
hand
while
in
louis
just
before
the
war
i
got
acquainted
with
a
man
from
detroit
by
the
name
of
james
scott
he
was
dealing
faro
bank
and
was
such
a
square
fellow
that
all
the
boys
would
play
against
him
he
had
a
big
game
one
evening
and
had
downed
quite
a
number
of
the
boys
but
he
did
it
on
the
square
he
quit
dealing
to
go
and
get
his
supper
and
while
he
was
out
the
boys
tried
to
think
of
some
scheme
to
stick
him
for
enough
money
to
get
a
square
meal
for
themselves
finally
one
of
them
thought
of
the
same
racket
that
i
played
on
my
jew
partner
and
they
manufactured
a
sucker
when
jim
came
back
they
were
playing
a
game
of
poker
jim
loved
poker
and
as
he
had
not
finished
picking
his
teeth
he
stopped
at
the
table
to
look
on
that
was
just
what
the
boys
expected
and
wanted
so
the
two
hands
were
run
up
jim
was
behind
the
fellow
that
had
the
three
kings
and
a
pair
of
sevens
but
just
after
he
saw
them
some
one
spoke
to
him
on
the
other
side
so
he
went
around
the
table
the
man
with
the
kings
made
a
big
raise
and
the
other
fellow
said
it
was
more
money
than
he
had
jim
saw
his
three
aces
and
a
pair
so
he
said
i
am
with
you
old
boy
for
the
money
was
put
up
and
then
the
sucker
said
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
his
hand
and
wanted
to
take
down
his
money
but
everybody
said
he
could
not
take
down
then
the
fellow
threw
down
two
cards
and
called
for
two
more
the
old
boy
jim
partner
gave
them
to
him
and
the
sucker
made
another
raise
just
large
enough
to
use
up
the
balance
of
jim
thousand
the
old
boy
called
the
bet
just
in
time
to
save
jim
from
putting
up
another
thousand
for
they
did
not
want
to
strike
him
too
heavy
the
first
time
they
showed
down
and
the
sucker
had
caught
another
king
in
the
draw
and
he
won
the
pot
jim
did
not
say
a
word
but
began
to
deal
the
bank
the
next
night
some
of
the
boys
that
had
eaten
a
good
supper
at
jim
expense
invited
him
to
the
theatre
jim
wanted
to
know
the
play
they
told
him
the
hidden
hand
jim
said
no
boys
i
saw
that
play
last
night
and
i
would
not
see
it
again
for
jim
is
now
living
in
detroit
and
is
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
the
city
his
father
left
him
a
fortune
and
he
has
not
laid
down
a
dollar
on
a
gambling
table
since
yet
he
likes
the
boys
and
can
tell
some
of
the
best
stories
of
any
man
in
this
country
he
is
very
fond
of
the
theatres
but
he
says
he
never
goes
when
they
play
the
hidden
hand
caught
again
while
sitting
in
the
hall
of
the
steamer
i
noticed
a
fellow
who
kept
looking
at
me
so
closely
that
i
at
last
said
to
him
do
you
live
on
the
river
sir
he
replied
are
you
speaking
to
me
well
yes
i
asked
you
if
you
lived
on
the
river
he
answered
me
very
gruffly
no
sir
i
let
him
alone
for
i
thought
i
had
seen
him
before
and
it
might
be
i
had
beat
him
out
of
some
money
so
i
got
up
and
walked
down
the
cabin
after
i
left
he
asked
the
barkeeper
who
i
was
and
he
told
him
i
was
a
planter
and
the
son
of
one
of
the
wealthiest
planters
on
the
coast
the
fellow
said
darn
me
if
he
do
look
just
like
a
fellow
that
beat
me
out
of
some
years
ago
i
guess
you
are
mistaken
although
all
planters
gamble
more
or
less
said
the
barkeeper
well
let
take
a
drink
but
i
was
sure
he
was
the
same
man
just
as
they
finished
their
drink
i
walked
up
and
called
for
some
wine
the
fellow
spoke
up
and
said
have
a
drink
with
me
i
said
no
you
join
me
as
i
see
you
have
finished
yours
he
accepted
and
i
ordered
a
bottle
of
wine
we
sat
down
to
drink
the
wine
when
he
said
you
must
excuse
me
for
the
manner
in
which
i
spoke
to
you
a
while
ago
as
i
took
you
for
a
man
that
beat
me
out
of
on
one
of
these
boats
some
years
ago
at
a
game
they
called
monte
well
now
i
said
it
must
have
been
the
same
fellow
that
beat
me
for
that
what
they
called
it
monte
but
i
did
not
care
very
much
as
i
was
spending
the
old
gent
money
at
that
time
he
replied
but
i
did
mind
it
for
i
had
just
sold
my
place
and
was
going
to
put
the
money
into
business
but
on
account
of
that
d
d
rascal
i
have
had
to
work
hard
ever
since
and
i
have
sworn
to
kill
him
the
first
time
i
met
him
i
do
not
blame
you
for
feeling
as
you
do
for
you
could
not
afford
to
lose
the
money
but
i
did
not
care
as
the
old
gent
had
plenty
more
that
i
could
get
whenever
i
asked
for
it
and
as
he
sometimes
lost
pretty
heavy
himself
he
would
say
to
me
if
you
bet
you
will
win
or
lose
but
if
you
lose
take
it
cool
for
if
you
could
not
afford
to
lose
you
had
no
business
to
bet
you
right
i
did
not
have
any
business
to
bet
but
i
thought
i
had
a
sure
thing
of
winning
i
would
have
killed
that
fellow
the
next
morning
but
when
i
began
looking
for
him
i
found
he
had
got
off
the
boat
and
i
have
never
seen
him
since
i
laughed
and
said
if
you
had
won
the
money
you
would
not
have
felt
like
shooting
the
fellow
would
you
oh
no
i
found
out
the
fellow
had
about
but
he
was
just
as
much
a
sucker
as
he
was
when
he
lost
the
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
win
his
money
and
then
tell
him
that
i
was
the
same
man
that
beat
him
before
i
excused
myself
and
told
my
partner
all
about
the
fellow
and
that
i
wanted
to
win
his
money
after
supper
i
opened
up
monte
and
caught
a
good
many
suckers
my
old
producer
was
watching
the
game
and
me
too
we
had
about
finished
up
when
my
partner
said
to
my
old
friend
i
would
like
to
make
a
bet
but
i
am
unlucky
will
you
bet
this
for
me
he
took
the
put
it
up
and
won
then
he
put
up
for
himself
and
lost
my
partner
wanted
to
know
how
he
had
made
such
a
mistake
when
he
swelled
up
like
a
porpoise
and
said
i
believe
that
is
the
same
fellow
that
beat
me
out
of
my
money
before
he
walked
away
and
my
partner
followed
him
they
were
standing
at
the
bar
when
i
came
up
and
i
invited
all
hands
to
join
me
in
a
drink
everybody
accepted
the
invitation
except
my
arkansas
killer
i
made
up
my
mind
that
we
would
have
a
fight
so
i
thought
i
would
not
put
it
off
any
longer
i
turned
to
him
and
said
come
and
take
a
cigar
with
me
for
i
see
you
are
not
drinking
he
replied
i
pick
my
company
then
i
said
you
are
in
better
company
just
now
than
you
ever
were
in
your
life
except
the
time
some
years
ago
when
you
were
in
my
company
and
lost
he
said
you
are
a
d
d
rascal
i
then
called
him
a
liar
and
a
coward
he
attempted
to
draw
when
my
partner
caught
his
arm
and
gave
him
one
in
the
face
which
was
not
a
very
heavy
one
for
he
did
not
appear
to
mind
it
i
had
old
betsy
jane
out
and
had
him
covered
then
i
said
lay
away
your
old
pop
and
we
will
go
down
on
deck
and
have
it
out
you
are
a
much
larger
man
than
i
am
but
i
will
take
a
licking
from
you
if
you
are
man
enough
to
give
it
to
me
we
gave
our
guns
to
the
barkeeper
and
started
down
i
heard
some
bets
to
on
the
big
arkansas
man
so
i
gave
a
friend
of
mine
a
roll
and
told
him
to
take
all
the
odds
when
we
got
down
on
deck
the
mate
made
a
ring
with
some
barrels
and
said
no
man
but
the
fighters
shall
get
inside
the
ring
the
big
fellow
stripped
down
to
his
undershirt
and
looked
like
a
young
samson
then
the
bets
ran
up
to
i
pulled
off
my
coat
and
vest
and
stepped
inside
the
ring
we
shook
hands
and
time
was
called
the
mate
acting
as
referee
he
made
a
lunge
i
dropped
my
head
and
he
hit
it
a
terrible
blow
then
he
got
one
in
below
the
belt
and
i
thought
for
an
instant
i
would
lose
my
supper
and
the
fight
but
i
rallied
and
got
a
good
one
in
on
the
side
of
his
neck
which
doubled
him
up
like
a
jackknife
then
i
ran
in
caught
him
and
let
drive
with
my
head
i
struck
him
between
the
eyes
and
he
fell
over
as
if
he
had
been
shot
i
took
a
seat
on
one
of
the
barrels
folded
my
arms
and
waited
for
time
to
be
called
the
mate
said
that
will
do
this
man
ca
fight
any
more
they
took
him
up
stairs
and
had
the
barber
fix
him
up
i
was
not
much
the
worse
for
having
been
in
a
fight
my
friend
handed
me
all
my
money
and
over
besides
that
he
had
taken
in
on
the
result
i
treated
all
hands
and
sent
some
wine
also
the
i
had
won
back
to
my
arkansas
friend
he
told
the
mate
and
some
of
the
passengers
that
he
had
been
in
a
great
many
fights
but
that
was
the
first
time
he
was
ever
whipped
he
said
he
whipped
himself
when
he
hit
my
head
but
when
i
gave
him
that
butt
he
thought
he
had
been
struck
with
a
bar
of
iron
he
told
them
they
did
not
fight
that
way
out
where
he
lived
and
he
did
not
think
it
was
fair
the
mate
told
him
everything
was
fair
in
a
tumble
fight
i
felt
sorry
for
the
big
fellow
when
i
saw
his
face
for
his
nose
was
broken
all
up
he
forgot
all
about
that
he
was
going
to
shoot
the
man
that
beat
him
out
of
his
for
you
see
i
returned
the
money
that
i
won
from
him
when
i
had
him
caught
again
my
little
partner
a
man
by
the
name
of
dock
chambers
was
working
with
me
at
one
time
and
he
was
like
my
partner
foster
he
would
stoop
to
little
things
i
was
playing
poker
one
night
with
a
man
and
broke
him
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
went
back
into
the
ladies
cabin
and
in
a
short
time
returned
with
some
diamonds
and
a
lady
watch
and
chain
he
wanted
to
put
them
up
but
i
told
him
i
never
played
for
finery
a
man
offered
him
about
what
the
stuff
was
worth
and
he
was
so
crazy
to
play
that
he
was
about
to
let
them
go
when
i
advanced
him
much
more
on
them
than
the
stranger
had
offered
for
i
knew
he
would
lose
them
we
began
our
play
and
in
about
an
hour
i
had
won
all
the
money
that
i
had
advanced
him
on
the
jewelry
i
asked
him
if
he
was
broke
and
he
told
me
that
their
passage
was
paid
and
his
wife
had
some
money
i
bid
him
good
night
and
went
to
bed
the
next
morning
i
put
the
jewelry
in
a
cigar
box
gave
it
to
my
partner
and
told
him
to
find
the
lady
and
return
it
to
her
he
found
her
and
returned
the
box
she
opened
and
found
everything
her
husband
had
lost
then
she
gave
him
and
told
him
to
thank
me
for
her
he
came
back
and
gave
me
the
thanks
but
did
not
say
one
word
about
the
i
was
well
paid
with
the
thanks
until
i
found
out
that
she
had
sent
with
them
and
that
my
partner
had
hogged
onto
it
i
did
not
say
a
word
at
the
time
but
waited
until
i
could
get
a
big
even
we
were
coming
out
of
new
orleans
a
short
time
after
the
chambers
trick
and
had
a
good
monte
business
which
we
closed
up
as
soon
as
we
had
caught
all
the
suckers
i
went
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
kept
a
drug
store
in
vicksburg
and
told
him
i
wanted
to
get
even
with
my
partner
i
gave
him
some
money
and
told
him
i
would
open
my
red
and
black
and
that
the
jack
paid
eight
for
one
i
said
to
him
you
come
up
and
bet
on
the
jack
three
times
and
on
the
fourth
time
you
put
a
bill
inside
of
the
ten
and
put
it
on
the
same
card
and
i
will
make
it
win
he
did
just
as
i
told
him
and
the
jack
lost
the
first
three
times
but
the
fourth
time
it
won
i
paid
the
and
started
to
make
another
turn
when
the
drug
man
said
you
will
have
to
come
again
i
said
there
is
your
and
your
sir
please
look
at
the
he
replied
i
did
look
at
it
and
there
was
a
great
big
live
inside
of
it
it
was
over
the
limit
but
i
had
turned
and
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
to
tell
the
truth
i
did
not
want
to
get
out
for
i
was
just
getting
in
on
my
partner
i
paid
the
over
to
the
and
shut
up
shop
as
i
did
not
want
to
lose
any
more
of
my
little
partner
money
lacked
the
nerve
i
made
a
mistake
one
time
that
came
near
getting
me
licked
and
it
was
only
the
want
of
nerve
that
saved
me
i
feel
the
effect
of
the
shock
to
this
day
and
i
believe
it
will
follow
me
to
my
grave
i
will
tell
how
it
happened
i
was
playing
the
little
game
of
monte
and
had
caught
some
pretty
good
fish
when
i
noticed
a
jew
that
i
had
seen
in
natchez
standing
near
the
table
and
watching
me
and
my
cards
very
closely
i
took
him
for
one
of
the
finny
tribe
and
expected
to
see
him
swim
up
and
take
hold
of
the
hook
but
he
walked
over
to
the
bar
and
commenced
talking
to
the
barkeeper
i
found
out
afterward
that
he
asked
the
barkeeper
who
i
was
and
told
him
he
could
beat
me
at
that
game
i
was
playing
for
says
he
do
you
know
there
is
a
little
spot
on
one
of
the
cards
and
i
do
believe
he
can
see
it
the
barkeeper
was
a
friend
of
mine
and
he
told
the
jew
that
i
could
see
very
well
as
i
was
up
so
much
at
night
i
was
fishing
along
when
back
came
the
sucker
then
i
began
to
think
a
little
better
of
myself
for
i
had
spotted
the
fellow
and
when
i
saw
him
walk
off
i
began
to
think
that
for
once
i
had
made
a
mistake
in
my
man
and
was
losing
some
of
my
conceit
he
got
up
very
close
and
then
he
asked
me
how
much
i
would
bet
him
that
he
could
not
turn
the
card
with
the
old
woman
on
it
i
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
as
i
had
lost
a
little
of
my
confidence
when
i
saw
him
go
away
but
soon
i
remembered
that
the
best
fish
will
sometimes
play
around
the
bait
and
then
swim
off
only
to
come
back
dart
in
and
swallow
it
hook
and
all
so
i
said
to
him
i
will
bet
you
you
ca
pick
up
the
old
woman
the
first
pick
i
had
worth
of
confidence
thirty
years
ago
that
no
man
could
pick
up
the
old
woman
but
i
am
married
now
and
have
quit
gambling
but
i
will
bet
that
no
man
can
pick
up
my
old
the
first
pick
well
the
jew
put
up
and
picked
up
one
of
the
cards
and
as
his
eyesight
was
so
much
better
than
mine
he
got
the
one
with
the
little
spot
on
it
and
while
he
was
looking
for
the
old
woman
on
the
other
side
of
the
card
i
put
the
in
my
pocket
and
rang
down
the
curtain
the
jew
stood
and
held
on
to
the
card
until
i
told
him
if
he
was
done
with
it
i
would
like
to
have
it
he
handed
it
to
me
and
then
walked
over
to
the
barkeeper
and
said
to
him
that
man
devol
can
see
better
than
we
thought
he
could
i
was
standing
out
on
the
guards
smoking
when
up
came
my
food
for
the
brain
he
said
to
me
devol
i
am
a
poor
man
with
a
wife
and
four
little
children
that
money
i
lost
was
all
i
had
in
the
world
and
it
was
given
to
me
by
my
friends
to
start
me
in
a
little
business
if
i
do
get
that
money
i
am
a
ruined
man
and
my
poor
wife
and
little
children
will
starve
to
death
for
i
will
never
see
them
again
oh
devol
take
pity
on
my
poor
wife
and
four
little
children
and
give
me
back
the
money
you
are
a
rich
man
and
can
make
money
so
fast
and
my
poor
wife
and
four
little
children
will
pray
for
you
as
long
as
we
live
and
i
will
tell
my
children
children
what
a
good
man
d
hold
on
i
said
as
i
saw
the
big
tears
running
down
the
man
face
here
your
money
take
it
and
give
it
to
your
family
i
handed
him
a
five
bill
and
turned
away
took
out
my
handkerchief
and
was
just
wiping
something
off
my
cheek
when
i
thought
i
heard
something
like
a
laugh
i
turned
around
and
there
a
little
way
off
stood
my
poor
jew
with
seven
five
dollar
bills
in
his
hand
shaking
them
at
me
and
he
said
i
have
go
no
wife
nor
no
four
little
children
mr
d
he
did
not
finish
for
i
started
for
him
and
he
lit
out
as
if
the
devil
instead
of
devol
was
after
him
when
we
got
to
the
city
i
went
into
the
first
harness
store
i
came
to
and
bought
a
whip
but
i
never
had
the
nerve
to
use
it
the
three
fives
at
one
time
i
was
going
down
the
river
below
baton
rouge
and
there
were
a
lot
of
raftsmen
on
board
they
all
loved
to
gamble
so
one
of
them
opened
a
chuckaluck
game
they
were
putting
down
their
money
with
both
hands
and
the
game
was
over
winner
i
thought
i
would
give
him
a
little
play
so
i
went
to
my
room
and
got
a
set
of
dice
the
same
size
as
he
was
using
and
then
changed
in
a
five
without
winning
a
bet
then
i
asked
him
if
i
could
shake
them
once
for
luck
oh
yes
he
said
for
he
was
playing
on
the
square
i
came
the
change
on
him
then
i
put
inside
of
a
dollar
bill
and
put
it
on
the
five
he
shook
them
up
when
lo
and
behold
up
came
three
fives
he
picked
up
my
money
and
when
he
saw
the
he
looked
worse
than
a
sick
monkey
but
he
paid
up
like
a
man
i
then
came
the
change
back
and
quit
a
man
should
learn
all
the
tricks
in
his
trade
before
he
takes
down
the
shutters
snaked
the
wheel
we
were
going
up
with
captain
bill
harrison
on
board
the
and
just
after
leaving
the
wharf
i
took
a
look
around
to
find
some
suckers
i
had
not
found
anything
that
i
thought
suited
me
and
was
standing
at
the
bar
talking
to
captain
bill
when
he
asked
me
if
the
fellows
in
the
barber
shop
were
with
me
i
said
what
fellows
for
i
could
see
my
partners
brown
and
chappell
sitting
out
on
the
guards
he
said
go
back
and
take
a
peep
at
them
i
did
go
back
and
i
saw
some
fellows
with
two
tables
covered
all
over
with
jewelry
and
silverware
they
had
a
wheel
with
numbers
on
it
and
the
corresponding
numbers
were
on
the
table
under
the
jewelry
etc
they
were
just
getting
started
and
had
some
customers
who
were
paying
their
dollar
and
trying
their
luck
turning
the
wheel
i
looked
on
until
i
thought
i
understood
the
game
and
then
i
went
to
the
pantry
and
came
back
i
saw
a
nice
looking
watch
on
one
of
the
numbers
but
the
space
on
the
wheel
that
had
the
same
number
on
it
was
so
very
narrow
that
the
wheel
would
not
stop
on
it
one
time
in
a
thousand
i
asked
the
boss
if
the
watch
was
good
and
he
told
me
that
any
one
who
won
it
could
have
in
gold
if
he
did
not
want
the
watch
i
fooled
around
a
little
while
then
i
put
down
my
dollar
and
gave
the
wheel
a
pretty
heavy
whirl
she
went
around
about
twice
and
stopped
on
the
number
that
called
for
the
watch
the
fellow
was
all
broke
up
but
he
gave
me
in
gold
and
i
put
up
another
dollar
i
started
the
wheel
again
and
i
hope
i
may
never
see
the
back
of
my
neck
if
she
did
not
stop
on
the
watch
again
the
boss
was
dumbfounded
he
looked
at
the
wheel
paid
me
another
in
gold
and
as
he
paid
over
the
money
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
did
not
like
me
and
as
i
make
it
a
rule
not
to
stay
where
i
am
not
wanted
i
went
out
to
see
the
boys
i
told
them
how
it
was
done
and
they
went
in
and
got
in
gold
as
they
were
coming
out
they
heard
the
fellow
say
who
in
the
h
l
put
this
molasses
on
the
wheel
we
opened
monte
and
caught
the
wheel
man
for
his
entire
stock
and
we
had
more
christmas
presents
than
anybody
in
the
state
molasses
will
catch
more
suckers
than
soft
soap
the
killer
at
one
time
i
was
dealing
red
and
black
on
the
at
the
mouth
of
red
river
and
as
there
were
a
number
of
texas
boys
on
the
boat
i
was
doing
a
good
business
while
i
was
very
busy
watching
the
game
a
big
fellow
who
was
employed
by
the
proprietor
of
the
boat
came
up
and
asked
me
to
loan
him
for
a
few
minutes
as
he
had
made
a
bet
with
a
man
that
he
could
show
up
that
much
money
i
saw
he
had
been
drinking
but
i
was
too
busy
just
then
to
argue
the
case
for
i
knew
if
i
refused
him
he
would
want
a
fuss
as
he
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
great
fighter
and
i
had
been
told
that
he
had
killed
three
men
so
i
handed
him
a
bill
and
went
on
with
my
game
after
getting
about
all
the
money
that
the
texas
boys
would
give
up
i
closed
my
game
and
went
out
to
find
my
i
inquired
after
the
fellow
and
was
told
that
he
was
up
on
the
levee
so
i
waited
for
him
it
was
not
long
until
he
showed
up
and
he
was
pretty
drunk
i
asked
him
to
give
me
back
the
bill
and
he
told
me
he
had
spent
it
i
was
mad
but
i
did
not
want
to
have
a
fuss
just
then
as
the
texas
boys
were
standing
around
and
i
did
not
want
them
to
join
in
so
i
said
if
you
have
spent
it
all
right
you
can
hand
it
to
me
i
was
just
giving
him
taffy
for
i
knew
he
intended
to
rob
me
out
of
the
money
thinking
i
would
not
dare
to
tackle
him
but
he
did
not
know
me
the
texas
boys
had
gone
to
bed
and
there
were
but
few
persons
in
the
room
the
big
killer
was
standing
near
the
bar
when
i
saw
a
chance
and
let
fly
i
caught
him
under
the
chin
and
knocked
him
as
stiff
as
a
poker
then
i
took
his
big
gun
out
of
his
pocket
and
threw
it
out
into
the
river
i
told
a
black
boy
to
go
through
his
pockets
and
see
if
he
had
my
bill
he
did
so
and
finally
found
it
in
his
fob
pocket
after
i
got
my
money
back
i
let
him
up
and
told
him
to
get
off
the
boat
and
i
said
if
you
come
back
while
i
am
here
i
will
beat
your
head
off
he
lit
out
i
gave
a
black
man
a
gun
and
told
him
not
to
let
the
fellow
on
the
boat
the
next
day
i
was
told
he
was
saying
he
was
going
to
kill
me
so
i
got
a
double
barrel
and
sent
him
word
to
come
down
and
see
me
he
did
not
come
but
went
down
to
hog
point
took
a
boat
and
left
that
part
of
the
country
as
it
had
got
too
hot
for
him
around
there
i
saw
him
some
years
later
at
laramie
city
dakota
and
put
the
police
onto
him
they
gave
him
one
hour
to
get
out
and
that
is
the
last
i
have
ever
heard
of
him
caught
a
whale
an
old
friend
of
mine
by
the
name
of
william
hines
who
was
one
of
the
best
steamboat
mates
that
ever
ran
on
the
river
and
i
were
laying
off
at
one
time
in
new
orleans
and
we
took
a
notion
we
would
get
a
yacht
and
have
a
big
sail
we
laid
in
a
supply
of
provisions
and
did
not
forget
a
jug
of
whisky
we
went
out
to
the
lake
hired
a
yacht
and
started
bill
was
pretty
full
so
i
told
him
to
go
below
and
lay
down
for
a
while
and
i
would
look
after
the
boat
the
wind
was
shifting
about
and
i
was
afraid
the
boom
would
knock
him
overboard
i
was
sailing
along
at
a
fine
rate
tacking
about
with
the
wind
and
did
not
notice
that
bill
had
come
up
on
deck
until
i
heard
him
yell
out
to
me
i
looked
around
and
saw
the
big
fat
fellow
floundering
in
the
water
about
feet
away
i
gave
her
all
the
rudder
downed
sail
and
then
threw
out
a
line
bill
swam
up
and
caught
hold
of
the
line
and
then
i
began
pulling
him
in
i
had
landed
many
big
suckers
but
bill
was
no
sucker
he
was
a
whale
i
got
him
up
alongside
but
i
was
not
man
enough
to
pull
him
up
as
the
boat
stood
about
four
feet
out
of
the
water
he
was
so
full
of
whisky
and
water
that
he
could
not
help
himself
he
was
about
played
out
when
he
said
to
me
george
i
a
goner
i
told
him
to
hold
on
just
a
minute
i
got
a
small
line
took
two
around
his
arm
and
then
made
fast
to
the
boat
i
knew
he
could
not
go
down
unless
his
arm
pulled
out
and
there
was
no
danger
of
that
i
took
a
rest
and
then
let
on
as
if
i
was
going
to
raise
sail
when
bill
said
george
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
looked
back
at
him
and
said
i
have
caught
a
whale
and
am
not
able
to
pull
him
in
so
i
going
to
tow
him
ashore
bill
looked
at
me
just
long
enough
to
satisfy
himself
that
i
was
in
earnest
and
said
for
god
sake
george
give
me
one
more
pull
for
i
do
want
you
to
sail
in
with
me
in
tow
so
i
went
to
him
as
i
had
got
rested
and
he
had
got
sober
we
pulled
together
and
i
soon
had
the
big
fellow
on
board
we
sailed
around
for
some
time
but
when
we
had
to
make
a
tack
you
can
bet
your
life
that
bill
was
on
the
lookout
for
the
boom
every
time
we
would
consult
the
jug
bill
would
say
george
do
tell
the
boys
about
how
much
fun
we
have
had
on
this
trip
will
you
the
the
of
the
steamer
had
been
drinking
and
some
of
them
were
a
little
drunk
they
came
up
to
get
more
of
the
fighting
stuff
and
got
into
some
difficulty
with
the
barkeeper
i
was
sitting
near
the
bar
at
the
time
and
as
i
was
always
ready
to
do
my
friends
a
favor
i
went
out
on
the
guards
and
tried
to
stop
the
fuss
and
get
the
men
to
go
down
on
deck
one
big
fellow
who
was
the
fighting
man
of
the
crew
and
a
favorite
with
the
mate
thought
it
was
none
of
my
business
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
he
cut
loose
at
me
i
saw
it
in
time
to
get
up
my
guard
i
did
not
want
to
have
any
difficulty
on
a
boat
with
any
of
the
officers
or
crew
so
i
tried
to
quiet
the
fellow
down
but
he
would
not
have
it
but
came
at
me
again
i
could
not
avoid
it
as
he
was
too
drunk
to
have
any
sense
so
i
let
fly
caught
him
under
the
chin
and
brought
him
down
he
was
a
game
one
for
he
was
up
and
at
me
once
more
i
then
let
into
him
and
gave
him
a
pretty
good
licking
they
took
him
down
on
deck
and
it
was
not
long
until
tom
hawthorn
the
mate
came
up
and
asked
who
it
was
that
had
whipped
one
of
his
men
the
barkeeper
told
him
about
all
the
fuss
but
he
was
mad
and
would
not
excuse
any
man
for
defending
himself
against
one
of
his
men
i
was
in
the
barber
shop
at
the
time
but
the
barkeeper
sent
me
word
to
look
out
for
tom
i
went
and
got
my
old
friend
betsy
jane
and
waited
for
the
fray
i
was
in
the
hall
when
tom
came
up
looking
for
me
he
walked
up
and
said
ca
you
find
any
one
else
to
whip
without
jumping
on
one
of
my
men
i
knew
he
had
been
told
the
circumstance
and
if
he
had
any
sense
he
would
not
blame
me
but
he
was
mad
and
then
he
intended
to
teach
me
a
lesson
i
knew
he
would
not
listen
to
reason
so
i
said
i
gave
that
fellow
just
what
he
deserved
he
began
to
pull
of
his
coat
and
at
the
same
time
said
any
man
that
licks
one
of
my
men
has
got
to
lick
me
i
saw
i
had
to
fight
so
i
off
with
my
coat
and
waited
for
him
he
struck
out
but
i
caught
it
on
my
arm
i
did
not
want
to
use
my
head
unless
it
was
necessary
but
as
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
long
reach
he
had
the
advantage
so
i
watched
my
chance
then
ran
in
caught
him
around
the
waist
and
downed
him
it
was
hard
work
to
keep
the
old
head
from
taking
a
hand
but
i
gave
him
several
good
ones
on
his
face
and
neck
he
tried
to
rise
up
when
i
got
in
an
upper
cut
which
settled
him
i
let
him
up
and
he
went
down
on
deck
he
had
it
in
for
me
until
one
night
in
a
saloon
when
he
hit
a
man
the
fellow
got
the
drop
and
would
have
shot
him
if
i
had
not
taken
a
hand
after
that
we
were
good
friends
and
he
would
say
to
me
george
you
are
the
only
man
that
can
whip
my
the
black
leg
cavalry
for
those
that
fly
may
fight
again
which
he
can
never
do
that
slain
hence
timely
running
no
mean
part
of
conduct
in
the
martial
art
by
which
some
glorious
feats
achieve
as
citizens
by
breaking
thrive
when
the
war
broke
out
some
of
the
gamblers
in
new
orleans
got
up
a
cavalry
company
and
named
it
the
wilson
rangers
i
was
a
member
of
the
company
we
armed
and
equipped
ourselves
and
the
ladies
said
we
were
the
finest
looking
set
of
men
in
the
army
if
fine
uniforms
and
good
horses
had
anything
to
do
with
it
we
were
a
fine
body
when
we
were
ordered
out
to
drill
which
was
every
day
we
would
mount
our
fine
horses
gallop
out
back
of
the
city
and
the
first
orders
we
would
receive
from
our
commanding
officer
would
be
dismount
hitch
horses
march
hunt
shade
begin
playing
there
was
not
a
company
of
cavalry
in
the
southern
army
that
obeyed
orders
more
promptly
than
we
did
for
in
less
than
ten
minutes
from
the
time
the
order
was
given
there
would
not
be
a
man
in
the
sun
they
were
all
in
the
shade
seated
on
the
ground
in
little
groups
of
four
five
and
six
and
in
each
group
could
be
seen
a
little
book
of
tactics
or
at
least
it
looked
something
like
a
book
at
a
distance
we
would
remain
in
the
shade
until
the
cool
of
the
evening
when
the
orders
would
be
given
cease
playing
put
up
books
prepare
to
mount
mount
march
when
we
would
get
back
to
the
city
the
people
would
come
out
cheer
wave
handkerchiefs
and
present
us
with
bouquets
for
we
had
been
out
drilling
in
the
hot
sun
preparing
ourselves
to
protect
their
homes
from
the
northern
invaders
after
we
had
become
proficient
in
drill
we
were
ordered
to
do
patrol
duty
in
the
city
the
citizens
called
us
their
defenders
and
we
did
defend
them
so
long
as
there
was
no
hostile
foe
within
five
hundred
miles
of
them
we
were
as
brave
a
body
of
men
as
there
was
in
the
south
until
the
news
reached
us
that
commodore
farragut
was
bombarding
forts
jackson
and
philip
then
we
began
to
realize
that
the
war
was
getting
pretty
close
to
home
and
we
were
a
little
fearful
that
our
knowledge
of
the
tactics
would
be
but
little
protection
to
us
if
the
forts
should
capitulate
we
threw
aside
the
old
books
we
had
been
studying
for
so
long
a
time
and
took
up
a
new
edition
that
our
commander
told
us
was
much
better
in
times
of
immediate
danger
so
for
about
six
days
we
devoted
ourselves
to
studying
how
to
get
out
of
the
we
had
got
into
without
losing
our
stake
we
were
not
kept
very
long
in
suspense
for
early
one
beautiful
april
morning
we
learned
the
terrible
news
that
farragut
fleet
had
passed
the
forts
and
general
butler
with
a
large
land
force
was
marching
on
the
city
we
heard
the
old
familiar
orders
prepare
to
mount
mount
march
but
we
did
not
swing
into
our
saddles
feeling
as
gay
as
when
we
were
on
our
way
to
the
grounds
we
were
ordered
to
the
front
and
as
we
rode
through
the
streets
the
ladies
presented
us
with
bouquets
and
cheered
after
us
but
then
there
was
but
little
cheer
in
that
fine
body
of
gamblers
we
had
many
times
before
attacked
the
enemy
tiger
without
fear
or
trembling
but
now
we
were
marching
to
meet
a
foe
with
which
we
were
but
slightly
acquainted
as
we
passed
the
old
on
our
way
to
the
front
there
was
a
sigh
passed
the
lips
of
every
man
and
our
horses
turned
in
for
they
poor
dumb
brutes
did
not
know
that
things
had
changed
we
were
about
six
miles
below
the
city
when
the
yankees
saw
us
but
we
did
not
see
them
as
they
were
about
four
miles
distant
they
were
up
in
the
rigging
with
their
glasses
looking
for
just
such
suckers
as
we
were
and
they
turned
loose
a
salute
of
canister
which
came
buzzing
about
our
ears
and
the
next
instant
we
heard
an
order
that
we
had
never
heard
before
retreat
but
we
understood
it
and
lost
no
time
in
obeying
the
command
for
i
believe
we
would
have
executed
the
movement
without
orders
if
they
had
not
been
given
just
after
the
first
salute
we
had
a
great
deal
just
then
to
make
us
feel
nervous
but
we
were
thankful
for
one
thing
and
that
was
we
had
good
fast
horses
i
had
taken
mine
off
the
race
track
and
i
was
glad
of
it
for
in
that
race
i
came
out
several
lengths
ahead
when
we
got
back
to
the
city
we
dismounted
without
orders
and
even
forgot
to
tell
the
darkies
to
give
our
horses
a
good
we
cut
the
buttons
off
our
coats
buried
our
sabres
and
tried
to
make
ourselves
look
as
much
like
peaceful
citizens
as
possible
for
we
had
enough
of
military
glory
and
were
tired
of
war
after
destroying
immense
quantities
of
cotton
sugar
steamboats
ships
and
other
property
to
prevent
its
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
unionists
general
lovell
with
his
confederate
troops
retreated
into
the
interior
of
the
state
and
left
the
city
without
any
other
defense
except
our
company
of
cavalry
but
as
we
had
buried
our
arms
and
cut
the
brass
buttons
off
our
beautiful
brown
corduroy
suits
the
citizens
had
as
much
confidence
in
our
ability
to
defend
as
they
had
when
the
enemy
was
five
hundred
miles
away
the
merchants
expected
that
the
yankees
would
sack
the
city
so
they
threw
open
their
stores
and
told
everybody
to
take
all
they
wanted
bush
was
boarding
with
me
at
the
time
and
as
he
was
one
of
the
biggest
eaters
in
the
world
i
wanted
more
than
i
could
carry
so
i
hired
a
dray
for
which
i
had
to
pay
and
loaded
it
down
to
the
guards
we
put
on
a
hogshead
of
sugar
hams
a
sack
of
coffee
box
of
tea
firkin
of
butter
barrel
of
potatoes
some
hominy
beans
canned
fruits
etc
i
would
have
put
on
more
but
the
dray
would
hold
it
and
as
the
load
started
up
canal
street
i
thought
when
bush
gets
away
with
all
that
stuff
i
make
him
change
his
after
laying
in
my
stock
i
went
down
to
the
river
to
see
the
fleet
come
in
and
there
were
all
of
our
company
but
they
did
not
make
the
slightest
resistance
the
captain
said
it
no
use
trying
to
bluff
them
fellows
for
they
have
got
a
full
hand
butler
in
new
orleans
general
butler
took
possession
of
the
city
the
day
of
may
his
troops
gutted
the
banks
but
did
not
molest
the
merchants
so
those
fellows
that
had
given
their
stuff
away
were
kicking
themselves
for
doing
so
he
closed
up
all
the
and
then
issued
licenses
for
public
gambling
to
any
one
who
would
pay
the
fee
and
take
his
brother
in
as
a
partner
his
profits
must
have
been
enough
to
make
him
independently
rich
without
the
spoons
he
kept
the
city
very
clean
but
old
got
in
and
then
ben
got
a
furlough
and
went
up
to
washington
and
he
took
the
spoons
with
him
he
took
the
marble
statue
of
henry
clay
out
of
the
house
at
baton
rouge
and
shipped
it
to
his
home
in
massachusetts
he
could
not
hide
that
as
easily
as
he
could
the
spoons
as
after
the
war
the
united
states
government
made
him
return
it
and
that
nearly
killed
him
i
had
the
and
was
running
games
out
at
the
lake
i
was
making
a
great
deal
of
money
and
would
work
the
boats
when
i
had
time
some
one
told
butler
that
i
called
him
names
so
he
sent
for
me
and
threatened
to
send
me
to
tortugas
but
i
talked
him
out
of
that
some
of
his
officers
lost
their
money
against
my
games
and
then
kicked
the
result
was
old
ben
sent
for
me
again
this
time
i
did
not
get
off
so
easily
he
took
me
before
the
provost
judge
who
fined
me
and
sent
me
to
jail
for
one
year
and
no
amount
of
money
could
get
me
out
there
were
some
of
the
best
men
in
the
south
in
with
me
and
our
friends
on
the
outside
did
not
forget
us
we
had
good
beds
and
everything
to
eat
that
the
market
afforded
we
played
poker
and
i
was
making
money
all
the
time
i
would
fee
the
jailer
and
at
night
he
would
take
me
out
in
the
city
so
that
my
prison
life
was
not
so
very
bad
butler
made
us
a
visit
one
day
just
at
dinner
time
and
when
he
saw
the
birds
and
wine
you
should
have
heard
him
roar
why
said
he
those
d
d
rascals
are
living
better
than
i
ever
did
the
jailer
told
him
that
our
friends
sent
in
the
luxuries
he
looked
at
our
big
beds
shower
bath
and
other
surroundings
and
said
i
have
a
d
d
notion
to
send
them
to
the
penitentiary
but
the
jailer
told
him
it
was
pulled
down
so
he
had
to
give
up
his
d
d
notion
and
we
were
glad
of
it
i
had
been
in
jail
for
six
months
when
one
day
governor
shipley
visited
us
he
asked
the
jailer
which
is
devol
i
was
introduced
to
him
and
he
asked
me
where
i
was
raised
i
told
him
in
ohio
he
said
the
crime
i
was
in
for
was
not
so
very
serious
and
he
told
the
jailer
to
turn
me
out
and
i
should
come
to
his
office
i
was
let
out
and
i
reported
to
the
governor
he
told
me
not
to
beat
the
officers
i
promised
i
would
not
so
i
was
once
more
a
free
man
when
butler
heard
that
i
was
let
out
on
the
governor
orders
he
was
mad
as
the
d
so
to
get
even
he
confiscated
all
my
horses
which
had
cost
me
over
i
had
promised
the
governor
that
i
would
not
beat
the
officers
but
i
took
my
promise
back
when
ben
took
my
horses
and
it
was
not
long
after
that
i
caught
a
sucker
paymaster
for
and
they
did
not
find
out
who
it
was
that
won
the
greenbacks
i
made
a
pile
of
money
bought
substitutes
for
some
of
my
horses
and
opened
up
the
again
ben
butler
and
i
got
to
be
friendly
and
he
gave
me
two
silver
spoons
to
remember
him
by
and
i
have
them
yet
the
paymaster
i
remember
a
game
of
poker
i
had
once
coming
down
from
cairo
to
new
orleans
during
the
war
there
was
a
paymaster
in
the
game
who
lost
about
and
when
we
got
to
memphis
i
found
out
before
we
landed
that
he
was
going
to
squeal
so
i
went
to
the
mate
and
asked
him
to
put
me
where
they
could
not
find
me
as
i
knew
when
the
soldiers
came
down
to
the
boat
i
would
have
to
divulge
he
put
me
down
in
a
little
locker
that
was
forward
of
the
main
hatch
and
rolled
barrels
on
it
to
hide
the
well
they
came
down
took
lights
and
searched
the
boat
and
hold
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
cabin
and
at
last
gave
up
after
i
had
staid
down
there
for
eight
hours
the
boat
left
for
new
orleans
i
came
up
into
the
cabin
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
passengers
look
at
me
they
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
my
appearance
before
them
but
i
told
them
i
was
up
town
and
did
not
know
anything
of
what
was
going
on
and
i
took
in
many
a
dollar
after
that
general
banks
detective
i
had
a
big
game
of
roulette
one
night
during
the
war
when
the
northern
officers
were
traveling
up
and
down
the
river
the
boat
was
full
of
officers
and
general
banks
was
on
board
up
stepped
a
big
fellow
from
texas
who
was
a
detective
for
general
banks
he
pulled
out
a
confederate
bill
and
laid
it
on
the
red
i
picked
it
up
and
said
i
had
no
confederate
money
to
pay
him
in
in
case
he
won
he
got
very
saucy
and
went
over
to
the
bar
where
i
could
hear
every
word
he
said
and
told
the
barkeeper
that
as
soon
as
i
closed
that
game
he
would
whip
me
so
i
closed
up
and
sent
my
wheel
down
stairs
in
the
locker
and
walked
up
to
the
bar
and
asked
him
to
take
a
drink
so
that
he
would
make
some
remark
he
said
i
pick
my
company
i
let
drive
and
knocked
the
ginger
out
of
him
and
kept
him
spinning
around
until
he
yelled
out
then
came
the
rush
general
banks
and
staff
followed
by
all
the
officers
the
fellow
was
bleeding
like
a
stuck
pig
the
clerk
told
the
general
how
he
talked
and
he
said
he
got
just
what
he
deserved
i
then
sent
down
and
got
my
wheel
opened
and
all
the
officers
played
except
general
banks
i
was
sorry
he
did
not
appreciate
the
game
and
change
in
a
few
greenbacks
the
detective
bluff
i
was
coming
up
once
on
the
steamer
of
louisville
and
had
won
considerable
money
there
was
on
board
a
united
states
detective
he
was
asleep
at
the
time
the
games
were
going
on
and
when
he
came
to
his
breakfast
the
next
morning
there
was
a
great
deal
of
kicking
going
on
about
the
money
and
diamonds
that
the
gamblers
had
won
the
night
before
some
of
the
passengers
at
the
table
knew
the
detective
and
when
they
got
through
breakfast
they
all
got
with
him
and
they
told
him
finally
they
would
give
him
half
they
had
lost
if
he
would
get
it
back
so
he
saw
a
big
opening
and
concluded
to
make
a
big
bluff
to
get
the
money
he
came
to
me
as
i
was
standing
by
the
office
and
said
are
you
the
man
who
won
all
the
money
and
diamonds
last
night
i
told
him
i
was
the
man
he
said
you
must
give
it
back
every
cent
that
made
me
laugh
and
i
think
it
made
him
mad
for
he
pulled
back
his
coat
and
showed
me
his
badge
well
i
thought
he
was
as
good
a
sucker
as
any
of
the
rest
or
he
would
not
make
such
a
break
as
that
and
when
he
spoke
of
my
swindling
them
i
said
to
him
now
sir
i
will
show
you
just
how
i
beat
those
fellows
and
i
pulled
out
three
cards
and
said
if
you
will
walk
over
to
the
table
i
will
show
you
then
if
you
think
there
is
any
swindle
about
it
i
will
refund
every
dollar
he
said
all
right
i
commenced
to
play
them
over
and
had
him
guessing
lively
when
up
stepped
the
capper
and
took
a
look
at
the
cards
and
said
i
will
bet
you
i
can
turn
the
king
he
put
up
the
and
did
not
turn
the
card
so
he
and
the
detective
began
to
whisper
to
each
other
the
capper
telling
him
about
a
spot
that
was
on
the
right
card
then
he
made
a
proposition
to
go
me
more
i
put
up
the
money
to
cover
his
and
he
turned
the
right
card
took
his
money
and
walked
away
from
the
game
then
the
detective
said
i
will
bet
you
myself
i
put
up
he
laid
up
and
turned
the
right
card
one
of
the
bystanders
spoke
up
and
said
he
is
only
baiting
you
along
till
he
gets
a
big
bet
i
replied
you
are
about
right
he
said
i
will
bet
you
once
more
so
i
put
up
the
amount
and
he
turned
the
winning
card
again
so
up
stepped
the
capper
and
said
i
will
bet
you
that
i
can
turn
it
that
is
just
the
kind
of
a
bet
i
like
to
get
i
put
up
and
he
put
up
his
just
as
he
was
going
to
turn
he
got
the
detective
by
the
collar
and
got
his
advice
so
the
detective
told
him
which
one
it
was
are
you
sure
said
the
capper
no
not
sure
when
he
gets
a
big
bet
like
that
but
i
think
so
you
see
he
had
been
told
i
was
only
baiting
for
a
big
bet
well
the
result
was
the
capper
won
the
bet
and
that
made
the
detective
swell
up
like
a
toad
he
would
not
listen
to
any
of
the
outsiders
talk
any
more
but
offered
to
bet
i
said
if
that
is
all
the
money
you
have
you
had
better
keep
it
that
made
him
mad
and
he
pulled
out
his
long
and
said
i
have
got
as
much
money
as
you
perhaps
said
i
you
might
cripple
yourself
if
you
lost
much
money
no
said
he
i
am
no
child
when
i
bet
on
a
fair
game
like
this
i
expect
to
either
win
or
lose
he
counted
out
the
money
and
i
saw
he
had
the
he
won
from
me
and
a
little
more
left
i
told
him
i
would
bet
him
that
he
could
not
turn
the
king
so
he
put
up
just
as
he
was
about
to
turn
the
card
i
looked
at
him
and
said
i
will
let
you
back
out
and
give
you
to
take
down
your
money
and
not
turn
no
no
said
he
not
i
well
i
said
let
her
go
and
over
she
went
but
he
lost
this
time
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
he
looked
like
a
sick
kitten
then
he
got
up
and
went
to
his
room
and
finally
came
out
i
thought
there
would
be
the
d
to
pay
he
called
me
to
one
side
and
said
did
you
think
i
was
betting
in
earnest
oh
no
said
i
you
were
only
betting
in
fun
but
i
was
just
keeping
in
earnest
well
said
he
you
are
not
going
to
keep
my
money
oh
yes
i
do
care
what
you
do
with
those
other
fellows
money
but
i
want
mine
said
he
and
i
must
have
it
well
you
can
not
have
a
cent
of
it
i
backed
against
the
bar
and
told
him
he
must
be
crazy
if
he
thought
i
would
give
him
a
cent
back
as
i
never
gave
a
sucker
back
his
money
he
then
made
a
motion
to
his
hip
but
i
had
old
betsy
jane
in
my
coat
pocket
with
my
hand
on
it
and
my
partner
was
there
to
assist
in
holding
the
fort
he
saw
his
bluff
was
no
good
and
he
began
to
give
me
taffy
saying
he
had
just
got
that
money
as
a
reward
for
catching
a
man
and
that
he
had
worked
six
months
to
get
it
and
that
he
had
a
large
family
i
told
him
to
go
out
among
the
passengers
and
tell
them
that
he
had
lost
his
money
at
a
fair
game
and
then
come
to
my
room
and
knock
at
the
back
door
and
they
will
not
see
you
come
in
well
he
got
among
them
all
over
the
boat
and
told
them
it
was
a
fair
game
and
he
had
not
a
word
to
say
he
came
to
my
room
and
told
me
what
he
had
done
i
counted
out
and
gave
it
to
him
and
told
him
that
if
he
had
not
worked
so
hard
for
it
he
never
would
have
got
a
cent
back
so
he
went
off
contented
and
there
was
no
more
squealing
on
the
boat
the
young
man
from
new
york
during
the
war
i
took
my
gambling
tools
and
started
for
brownsville
texas
and
metamoras
i
took
passage
on
board
a
screw
steamer
which
had
sails
also
there
were
about
passengers
all
told
the
first
two
days
out
of
new
orleans
were
pleasant
but
there
came
on
a
squall
which
tore
the
sails
into
threads
and
came
near
swamping
the
vessel
it
stopped
blowing
in
about
half
an
hour
and
all
was
calm
there
was
a
young
man
on
board
whose
father
was
a
very
rich
man
in
new
york
and
had
sent
his
son
over
to
attend
to
some
business
while
in
new
orleans
he
became
acquainted
with
a
rich
firm
and
through
his
letters
from
his
father
they
intrusted
him
with
to
be
delivered
in
brownsville
it
happened
that
the
young
man
was
on
deck
during
the
storm
and
had
to
lie
flat
down
and
hold
on
to
a
coil
of
chain
after
the
storm
he
came
into
the
cabin
and
said
i
have
had
bad
luck
of
course
we
were
all
anxious
to
know
what
had
happened
to
him
he
said
he
had
had
twelve
notes
in
the
side
pocket
of
his
coat
and
the
wind
had
blown
his
coat
over
his
head
and
the
bundle
went
into
the
gulf
he
said
it
was
money
that
had
been
put
into
his
care
to
be
delivered
at
brownsville
and
that
his
father
would
have
to
stand
the
loss
we
all
felt
sorry
for
the
fellow
but
it
soon
died
out
and
there
was
no
more
said
about
it
till
we
got
to
brownsville
when
we
got
to
bagdad
and
took
the
stage
he
sat
close
to
me
and
commenced
talking
about
losing
the
money
he
said
he
felt
ashamed
to
show
up
at
the
firm
office
that
made
me
think
he
was
crooked
and
i
concluded
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
we
had
not
finished
our
dinners
at
the
hotel
in
brownsville
when
in
marched
a
squad
of
soldiers
and
the
captain
asked
which
man
was
devol
i
raised
up
and
said
that
is
my
name
he
said
the
general
in
command
wanted
me
all
right
i
said
i
went
down
to
headquarters
and
when
i
got
there
the
general
said
where
is
the
money
you
won
from
that
young
man
coming
over
on
the
ship
i
told
him
i
played
no
cards
with
any
young
man
on
the
vessel
have
you
got
proof
of
that
said
the
business
man
to
whom
the
money
belonged
yes
said
i
and
i
sent
to
the
hotel
and
got
the
captain
and
the
purser
who
testified
that
the
young
man
did
not
play
a
card
coming
over
so
i
was
acquitted
and
that
was
the
last
of
it
as
they
were
all
satisfied
that
the
boy
did
nothing
wrong
and
really
had
lost
the
money
but
i
had
him
spotted
for
it
takes
a
rascal
to
catch
a
rascal
the
captain
and
the
purser
were
the
only
two
who
did
gamble
going
over
and
they
were
very
fond
of
poker
so
my
partner
and
self
sat
in
and
we
played
all
the
way
over
we
realized
about
which
paid
our
expenses
and
a
few
hundred
dollars
besides
about
six
of
us
agreed
to
go
over
to
metamoras
that
night
and
spend
the
evening
the
young
man
said
to
me
that
he
would
like
to
go
along
i
said
all
right
so
we
all
started
and
we
had
a
fine
time
drinking
wine
and
pony
brandy
we
went
into
a
and
the
roulette
wheel
was
going
and
a
lively
game
at
that
there
was
one
man
who
was
playing
very
high
and
i
asked
his
name
they
said
it
was
the
mexican
general
cortenas
who
was
in
command
of
metamoras
well
i
took
out
a
bill
and
laid
it
on
the
red
and
it
came
red
i
let
it
lay
and
it
came
red
again
i
took
the
and
put
it
over
on
the
black
and
it
won
again
so
i
picked
up
the
money
and
walked
out
into
the
and
called
up
every
one
in
the
house
at
that
time
a
spaniard
would
run
a
knife
through
you
for
a
dollar
if
he
caught
you
in
the
dark
and
a
man
was
not
safe
to
step
outside
if
they
knew
he
had
money
on
his
person
he
wanted
his
pistol
in
his
hand
well
the
young
man
was
delighted
with
my
playing
and
said
i
wish
you
would
play
again
i
want
to
put
in
with
you
and
take
half
your
game
all
right
said
i
after
a
while
i
wanted
to
get
a
few
more
ponies
into
him
for
i
was
sure
he
had
the
money
so
i
changed
the
drinks
to
wine
and
i
could
see
his
eyes
snap
at
every
glass
at
last
i
said
i
guess
i
will
make
another
play
he
stepped
back
into
another
room
and
came
to
me
and
handed
me
a
bill
that
had
never
been
crumpled
i
handed
it
back
to
him
and
told
him
i
would
put
up
of
my
own
and
for
him
to
put
his
money
back
that
if
i
lost
he
could
get
it
changed
and
give
me
all
right
said
he
and
i
bet
on
the
black
and
won
it
i
bet
the
same
on
the
red
and
it
came
black
again
then
i
bet
on
the
red
and
it
came
red
the
result
was
i
played
along
until
i
was
winner
and
i
quit
i
handed
my
friend
and
told
him
i
was
too
tight
to
play
with
good
judgment
we
had
our
fun
out
and
got
over
to
brownsville
about
daylight
in
the
morning
we
all
slept
that
day
and
went
over
that
night
again
we
did
not
gamble
any
that
night
but
drank
wine
and
smoked
our
havanas
and
had
a
good
time
in
general
that
night
my
friend
said
to
me
i
wish
i
was
as
smart
as
you
at
cards
i
could
make
plenty
of
money
i
said
to
him
i
can
teach
you
well
said
he
if
you
get
into
any
game
i
want
to
be
an
equal
partner
he
did
not
know
anything
about
my
partner
who
came
over
with
me
as
i
had
posted
him
to
keep
away
from
me
my
partner
was
a
very
quiet
fellow
who
lived
in
new
orleans
his
name
was
william
mcgawley
well
i
told
him
perhaps
i
might
get
up
a
game
with
some
one
as
i
was
saving
him
for
myself
and
partner
i
did
not
want
the
money
split
up
into
too
many
parts
i
had
too
much
sense
to
play
in
brownsville
so
i
fixed
up
a
plan
for
him
and
me
to
take
the
stage
and
go
to
bagdad
to
see
if
i
could
not
find
some
one
there
to
play
poker
i
told
mcgawley
to
pay
the
bill
at
the
hotel
and
come
to
bagdad
the
next
day
with
the
baggage
which
he
did
the
next
evening
my
young
new
york
friend
and
i
were
sitting
on
the
porch
at
the
hotel
when
my
young
friend
espied
him
and
said
to
me
you
recollect
the
man
who
played
in
the
game
coming
over
in
the
vessel
yes
said
i
there
were
three
besides
myself
which
one
do
you
mean
i
do
mean
the
captain
or
the
purser
but
the
other
gentleman
yes
said
i
i
recollect
him
well
said
he
i
just
saw
him
down
stairs
i
am
positive
that
it
is
he
i
said
let
us
go
down
and
see
him
so
we
both
went
down
and
shook
hands
with
him
my
new
york
friend
was
very
much
pleased
to
see
him
thinking
i
might
get
a
game
of
poker
out
of
him
so
i
said
it
is
very
dull
here
what
will
we
do
to
pass
away
the
time
i
said
perhaps
we
might
get
up
a
little
game
of
poker
to
help
us
out
mcgawley
consented
to
play
a
little
while
so
we
went
and
got
a
room
in
the
hotel
and
some
checks
mcgawley
asked
what
limit
will
we
play
i
said
there
will
be
no
limit
in
the
game
all
right
said
he
i
did
not
want
to
dwell
too
long
on
that
mcgawley
went
out
on
purpose
to
let
the
gentleman
get
out
his
money
the
new
yorker
asked
me
how
much
i
would
require
i
said
it
is
going
to
be
an
unlimited
game
and
you
had
better
give
me
what
money
you
can
spare
for
if
i
beat
one
good
hand
for
him
i
will
break
him
he
handed
me
six
one
notes
well
we
went
to
work
and
you
bet
it
was
lively
i
started
in
winner
and
you
ought
to
have
seen
my
partner
eyes
snap
i
do
mean
mcgawley
of
course
for
he
was
a
quiet
as
a
lamb
finally
my
luck
changed
and
he
beat
one
hand
for
then
i
did
commence
to
kick
at
my
bad
luck
and
we
soon
made
up
another
purse
after
playing
some
two
hours
more
mcgawley
had
all
our
money
so
i
said
to
him
as
you
have
broke
us
both
will
you
lend
me
for
a
few
days
until
i
get
some
from
new
orleans
he
said
certainly
pulled
out
the
money
and
handed
it
to
me
and
i
gave
my
new
york
partner
half
saying
perhaps
we
will
have
better
luck
next
time
as
i
will
have
all
the
money
i
want
soon
from
new
orleans
then
i
will
tackle
him
again
and
of
course
you
are
in
with
everything
that
i
do
i
had
some
in
silver
that
i
did
not
know
how
to
get
on
board
the
ship
that
laid
outside
of
bagdad
without
paying
duty
on
it
so
i
went
to
a
man
from
new
orleans
whom
i
knew
well
by
the
name
of
eugene
dupratt
i
told
him
i
had
this
silver
and
asked
him
if
he
could
get
it
on
board
the
vessel
as
he
had
lighters
running
all
the
time
it
was
about
equal
to
running
the
blockade
or
smuggling
well
said
he
i
will
take
yourself
partner
trunks
and
silver
and
land
you
safe
on
board
the
ship
for
i
will
give
you
the
money
that
night
we
slipped
the
things
out
of
the
hotel
and
got
them
safely
on
board
the
lighter
and
were
soon
on
board
the
vessel
and
in
two
hours
were
under
sail
for
new
orleans
we
got
home
all
right
and
in
ten
days
after
we
landed
we
were
both
broke
and
ready
for
another
trip
broke
a
snap
game
we
left
new
orleans
on
a
red
river
packet
and
had
been
out
about
an
hour
when
a
man
came
up
to
me
and
said
captain
have
you
any
objection
to
a
man
opening
faro
on
your
boat
i
said
no
you
can
open
any
time
you
please
he
took
me
to
be
captain
heath
and
i
knew
he
did
not
care
he
said
i
will
open
after
supper
it
was
near
that
time
then
and
i
thought
i
must
go
to
work
if
i
wanted
to
beat
this
man
i
found
out
what
room
he
occupied
and
then
told
my
partner
to
stay
and
entertain
him
till
i
returned
i
went
to
his
room
and
found
an
valise
that
held
his
tools
i
tried
the
keys
i
had
and
found
one
to
fit
i
opened
the
valise
took
out
the
cards
and
punched
every
one
of
them
then
i
put
them
back
and
carefully
locked
the
valise
went
back
and
invited
them
to
take
a
drink
then
we
went
to
supper
and
after
it
was
over
the
old
fellow
brought
out
his
kit
and
opened
a
game
he
shuffled
and
put
the
cards
in
the
box
i
asked
him
what
limit
he
was
going
to
deal
he
said
if
any
of
you
put
too
much
on
a
card
i
tell
you
a
good
many
of
the
passengers
changed
in
and
he
had
a
lively
game
i
stood
alongside
of
him
so
i
could
look
down
into
the
deck
and
when
i
saw
white
show
i
would
copper
in
the
big
square
and
my
partner
would
play
the
other
end
and
middle
open
for
when
the
white
showed
it
would
be
an
ace
or
deuce
in
this
way
we
got
the
old
fellow
rattled
he
changed
decks
every
deal
but
had
the
same
bad
luck
we
finally
broke
him
and
then
won
his
tools
we
returned
the
latter
paid
his
passage
to
shreveport
and
gave
him
after
breaking
up
the
faro
man
i
said
gentlemen
i
have
a
game
here
in
which
i
only
need
three
cards
i
opened
out
had
a
fine
play
and
took
in
all
the
money
watches
and
pistols
that
they
had
we
were
then
ready
to
light
out
as
we
had
won
from
the
old
faro
dealer
and
about
besides
the
watches
and
pistols
at
monte
we
bid
the
boys
and
got
off
at
baton
rouge
stolen
money
i
landed
at
natchez
one
evening
just
after
dark
on
the
steamer
some
one
told
me
that
a
lady
had
been
robbed
of
that
day
by
some
smart
thieves
they
had
watched
her
go
into
the
bank
and
draw
the
money
and
then
walk
over
to
her
carriage
a
short
distance
from
the
bank
one
of
the
crooks
took
off
his
hat
put
a
pen
behind
his
ear
ran
over
to
the
carriage
and
said
madam
you
must
excuse
me
for
i
have
made
a
mistake
in
the
money
i
gave
you
you
need
not
get
out
but
sit
still
i
will
go
back
and
rectify
it
she
handed
him
the
money
never
to
see
it
or
him
again
after
we
backed
out
from
natchez
i
opened
out
my
wheel
in
the
barber
shop
the
passengers
came
in
and
played
until
when
i
closed
up
while
i
was
packing
up
my
wheel
a
fellow
came
to
me
and
said
i
got
a
man
with
me
who
has
got
about
and
i
want
him
to
lose
it
he
loves
to
play
poker
do
you
think
you
can
beat
him
oh
yes
i
replied
i
can
come
pretty
near
doing
it
he
said
i
want
half
as
he
is
a
thief
and
no
good
i
had
to
divide
with
him
that
i
got
in
natchez
well
bring
him
to
me
and
i
will
try
it
and
he
did
so
i
was
not
long
in
doing
him
up
for
his
part
of
the
stealings
i
divided
with
the
other
thief
and
then
opened
out
my
rouge
et
noir
game
the
other
fellow
dropped
in
and
i
won
his
part
of
the
money
so
i
had
it
all
i
bid
him
good
night
and
went
to
bed
but
i
could
not
sleep
because
i
knew
the
one
i
beat
last
would
rob
me
if
he
got
a
chance
i
laid
in
my
bed
a
long
time
presently
i
heard
some
one
feel
the
knob
of
the
outside
door
i
was
in
the
upper
berth
and
had
my
pistol
under
my
pillow
my
partner
was
in
the
lower
berth
for
he
had
not
been
well
that
night
and
went
to
bed
early
pretty
soon
bang
went
the
lock
and
a
piece
of
it
fell
on
the
floor
then
everything
was
still
for
some
time
and
at
last
in
he
came
just
as
he
commenced
to
look
about
him
to
see
how
the
land
lay
i
pulled
down
on
him
with
my
gun
as
i
could
see
him
plainly
by
the
light
through
the
transom
he
saw
the
gun
and
did
not
stop
on
the
order
of
his
going
but
he
went
at
once
i
got
up
dressed
myself
and
went
out
to
the
bar
there
was
thief
i
accused
him
of
being
in
my
room
but
he
denied
it
i
knew
he
was
lying
but
i
thought
best
not
to
do
anything
with
him
for
fear
i
might
have
to
give
up
the
stolen
money
and
i
had
not
lost
any
myself
signal
service
before
the
war
they
had
an
old
steamer
fitted
up
as
a
and
at
baton
rouge
to
accommodate
people
that
landed
late
at
night
or
would
be
waiting
for
a
boat
this
old
boat
was
headquarters
for
the
gamblers
that
ran
the
river
many
a
night
we
have
played
cards
in
the
old
cabin
until
morning
or
until
our
boat
would
arrive
when
thoroughbred
gamblers
meet
around
the
table
at
a
game
of
cards
then
comes
the
tug
of
war
we
would
have
some
very
hard
games
at
times
and
we
found
it
pretty
hard
to
hold
our
own
my
partner
proposed
that
we
fix
up
some
plan
to
down
the
gamblers
that
played
with
us
on
the
old
boat
so
we
finally
hit
upon
a
scheme
we
bored
a
hole
under
one
of
the
tables
and
another
under
one
of
the
beds
in
a
opposite
then
we
fixed
a
nail
into
a
spring
and
fastened
the
spring
on
the
under
side
of
the
floor
so
that
the
nail
would
come
up
through
the
floor
under
the
table
next
we
attached
a
fine
wire
to
the
spring
and
ran
it
up
into
the
then
we
bored
a
hole
in
the
bulkhead
of
the
just
over
the
top
berth
so
that
a
person
could
lie
in
the
berth
and
look
out
into
the
cabin
now
we
were
ready
for
the
thoroughbreds
when
we
would
get
one
of
our
smart
friends
we
would
seat
him
at
our
table
in
his
chair
which
was
always
on
the
side
of
our
we
called
it
ours
for
we
had
fitted
it
up
just
to
suit
us
and
for
fear
some
one
would
use
it
when
we
were
out
traveling
for
our
health
we
paid
for
it
all
the
time
we
had
a
good
boy
that
liked
to
lie
down
and
make
money
so
we
would
put
him
in
the
upper
berth
while
the
game
was
in
progress
he
would
look
through
the
and
if
our
friend
had
one
pair
he
would
pull
the
wire
once
if
two
pair
twice
if
threes
three
times
if
fours
four
times
etc
we
would
kick
off
one
boot
and
put
our
foot
over
the
nail
and
then
we
would
be
able
to
tell
what
hand
our
friend
held
one
day
i
was
playing
a
friend
at
our
table
and
he
was
seated
in
his
chair
i
got
the
signals
all
right
for
some
time
and
then
the
seemed
to
be
broken
i
waited
for
the
signals
until
i
could
not
wait
any
longer
for
i
was
a
little
behind
time
so
i
picked
up
a
spittoon
and
let
fly
at
our
room
that
restored
communications
and
i
received
the
signals
all
right
my
friend
wanted
to
know
what
i
threw
the
spittoon
for
i
told
him
the
cards
were
running
so
bad
that
i
got
mad
and
that
an
old
nigger
had
told
me
once
it
was
a
good
sign
to
kick
over
a
spittoon
when
playing
cards
so
i
thought
i
would
not
only
kick
it
over
but
would
break
the
d
d
thing
all
to
pieces
he
replied
i
noticed
that
your
luck
changed
just
after
you
threw
her
and
i
will
try
it
the
next
time
i
play
in
bad
luck
got
up
too
soon
we
were
passengers
with
captain
white
on
board
the
steamer
bound
for
new
orleans
one
night
and
i
had
taken
a
look
over
the
boat
but
there
was
nothing
in
sight
i
was
sitting
in
the
hall
near
the
bar
drinking
wine
and
enjoying
myself
when
a
fine
looking
gentleman
came
out
of
his
room
near
by
and
asked
me
if
supper
was
over
i
told
him
it
was
and
asked
him
to
join
me
in
some
wine
as
he
looked
like
he
wanted
something
he
accepted
the
invitation
and
told
me
he
was
hungry
i
called
the
porter
and
told
him
to
go
to
the
pantry
and
get
the
gentleman
a
lunch
which
he
did
he
thanked
me
for
my
kindness
for
he
thought
i
acted
from
pure
motives
which
i
did
and
then
invited
me
to
join
him
in
some
wine
i
accepted
for
i
thought
his
intentions
were
honorable
while
we
were
talking
and
drinking
i
asked
the
barkeeper
if
he
had
any
of
the
tickets
that
the
gentleman
played
the
new
game
with
before
supper
he
said
he
had
and
gave
me
some
of
them
i
began
throwing
we
bet
the
drinks
cigars
and
drinks
again
i
lost
most
of
the
time
my
capper
lost
a
bet
of
when
the
gentleman
said
good
gracious
man
where
are
your
eyes
you
see
that
the
baby
card
has
a
spot
on
it
my
partner
told
him
he
had
not
noticed
the
spot
so
the
man
pointed
it
out
to
him
then
he
made
me
another
bet
and
won
the
gentleman
then
began
to
think
he
was
smarter
than
the
man
who
had
lost
and
could
not
win
it
back
until
he
told
him
about
the
little
spot
i
saw
he
was
worked
up
so
i
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
win
something
before
i
quit
as
i
had
no
idea
of
betting
money
on
the
game
when
i
sat
down
but
i
would
bet
him
he
could
not
turn
the
card
with
the
baby
on
he
flashed
his
leather
when
i
saw
several
large
bills
but
i
pretended
not
to
notice
them
and
said
perhaps
you
had
better
not
bet
for
if
you
lose
it
might
distress
you
but
if
i
lose
i
will
not
mind
it
much
as
my
father
has
five
plantations
he
did
not
like
for
me
to
think
that
the
loss
of
a
paltry
would
distress
him
so
he
said
i
can
afford
to
bet
you
win
or
lose
that
made
me
mad
so
i
said
i
will
make
it
if
you
like
he
knew
he
would
win
but
he
was
no
hog
and
did
not
want
me
to
ask
my
old
dad
for
money
so
soon
my
partner
wanted
him
to
make
it
and
offered
to
take
half
but
i
said
no
one
at
a
time
gentlemen
then
the
fellow
put
up
saying
to
my
partner
i
thank
you
but
i
am
able
to
take
it
myself
he
turned
the
spotted
fawn
and
found
that
if
he
was
not
a
hog
he
was
a
sucker
i
then
told
him
i
thought
he
was
too
much
excited
and
invited
him
to
join
me
in
a
drink
for
i
was
always
very
liberal
about
treating
a
man
that
had
but
little
if
any
money
he
accepted
the
invitation
for
now
he
knew
i
was
a
gentleman
and
that
my
motives
were
honorable
after
taking
our
drinks
he
bid
me
and
walked
away
and
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
i
would
have
been
better
off
if
i
had
remained
in
bed
until
morning
i
thought
myself
that
he
got
up
too
soon
the
yellow
jeans
at
one
time
on
the
upper
mississippi
while
playing
monte
i
caught
a
jew
from
quincy
who
had
been
down
to
louis
buying
a
stock
of
jewelry
i
won
all
his
money
and
the
most
of
his
best
jewelry
i
would
not
gamble
for
anything
but
good
stuff
in
the
jewelry
line
after
i
beat
the
jew
he
set
up
a
big
kick
and
got
some
of
the
other
losers
to
join
him
they
finally
agreed
that
they
would
make
me
give
up
so
they
all
got
after
me
and
i
knew
there
would
be
some
fun
i
got
my
gun
backed
up
against
the
side
of
the
cabin
and
said
now
gentlemen
i
am
ready
to
pay
out
the
bank
is
open
the
first
one
that
comes
shall
be
the
first
served
so
do
be
backward
but
somehow
or
another
no
one
wanted
to
be
first
and
i
stood
pat
until
the
boat
landed
at
a
town
called
warsaw
then
i
backed
out
of
the
cabin
down
stairs
and
off
the
boat
when
they
saw
me
on
the
shore
they
set
up
a
yell
of
police
police
arrest
the
fellow
with
the
yellow
jeans
suit
the
marshal
came
running
down
and
i
told
him
i
was
the
man
they
wanted
arrested
so
he
waltzed
me
up
to
town
and
nearly
all
the
passengers
followed
us
some
to
get
their
money
back
and
others
to
see
the
fun
the
captain
said
he
would
hold
the
boat
if
they
would
decide
the
case
at
once
so
the
mayor
convened
his
court
and
we
went
into
the
trial
i
had
sent
for
the
best
lawyer
in
the
town
and
he
said
he
would
clear
me
for
the
jew
was
put
on
the
stand
and
he
swore
i
snatched
his
jewelry
from
him
and
a
great
deal
more
of
the
same
sort
some
of
the
passengers
that
had
seen
the
game
swore
they
did
not
see
any
body
do
any
snatching
except
the
jew
my
lawyer
handled
the
case
so
nicely
that
i
was
acquitted
then
you
should
have
heard
the
passengers
laugh
at
the
jew
for
all
his
trouble
they
would
ask
him
if
he
did
not
want
to
trade
some
jewelry
for
a
yellow
jeans
suit
but
he
did
not
have
any
good
jewelry
left
and
he
knew
i
was
not
sucker
enough
to
trade
for
any
other
kind
there
was
another
boat
at
the
landing
and
many
of
the
passengers
went
up
to
hear
the
trial
i
went
on
board
the
other
boat
and
in
a
short
time
was
on
my
way
back
to
louis
during
the
trip
i
ran
up
a
poker
hand
in
a
game
of
euchre
and
lifted
a
man
out
of
which
more
than
paid
the
expenses
of
the
trial
he
knew
my
hand
we
were
on
board
a
red
river
packet
called
the
and
we
had
not
made
any
preparations
to
gamble
after
a
while
a
gentleman
came
up
and
asked
me
if
i
ever
played
poker
my
partners
tom
brown
and
holly
chappell
and
some
of
the
officers
of
the
boat
were
sitting
there
and
heard
the
conversation
they
had
to
put
their
handkerchiefs
in
their
mouths
to
keep
from
laughing
when
they
heard
my
answer
no
i
did
not
well
said
he
i
will
teach
you
if
you
will
sit
down
he
got
a
deck
of
cards
at
the
bar
and
commenced
to
show
me
which
were
the
best
hands
i
at
last
agreed
to
play
ante
we
played
along
and
i
was
amused
to
see
him
stocking
the
cards
or
at
least
trying
to
do
so
he
gave
me
three
queens
and
i
lost
on
them
for
he
beat
them
with
three
aces
presently
he
beat
a
full
hand
and
won
that
made
him
think
his
man
was
a
good
sucker
i
always
laughed
at
my
losing
and
kept
telling
him
that
after
a
while
i
would
commence
to
bet
higher
i
pulled
out
a
big
roll
of
bills
and
laid
it
on
the
table
finally
i
held
out
four
fives
and
then
i
went
a
big
blind
on
his
deal
so
that
if
he
did
not
come
in
i
would
throw
down
my
hand
and
perhaps
there
would
be
no
pair
in
it
about
this
time
he
commenced
to
work
with
the
cards
but
i
paid
very
little
attention
to
his
work
after
playing
a
while
i
got
three
jacks
and
then
we
commenced
to
bet
high
he
raised
me
and
i
raised
him
back
and
at
last
he
thought
we
had
enough
up
then
i
got
away
with
the
hand
he
gave
me
and
pulled
up
the
four
fives
then
the
betting
became
lively
i
made
him
call
me
and
when
he
saw
my
hand
and
i
had
got
the
money
he
grabbed
at
me
and
said
that
is
not
the
hand
you
had
how
the
d
do
you
know
what
i
had
well
says
he
where
are
the
other
five
cards
i
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
he
counted
the
cards
carefully
and
found
the
jacks
for
i
had
palmed
them
on
top
of
the
deck
then
he
pulled
out
his
knife
and
said
you
are
a
gambler
and
i
want
my
money
back
oh
is
that
all
i
did
not
understand
i
will
give
it
back
as
i
do
want
to
keep
your
money
if
you
think
i
did
not
win
it
fairly
i
let
on
as
though
i
was
taking
out
the
money
when
i
pulled
out
old
betsy
jane
he
saw
her
looking
him
in
the
face
and
he
wilted
like
a
calf
i
made
him
apologize
and
you
never
saw
a
man
get
such
a
turning
over
as
they
all
gave
him
they
told
him
he
not
pick
out
such
apt
scholars
for
they
learn
too
quickly
what
hurt
my
feelings
more
than
anything
else
was
that
he
would
not
speak
to
me
all
the
way
up
to
where
i
got
off
as
i
was
leaving
the
boat
i
said
to
him
sir
we
are
never
too
old
to
learn
her
eyes
were
opened
high
miller
and
i
were
playing
monte
one
night
on
the
first
and
had
a
good
game
and
made
some
money
we
were
about
to
close
up
when
a
lady
and
gentleman
passed
by
and
saw
high
throwing
the
little
tempters
they
stopped
and
watched
him
i
saw
they
were
interested
so
i
stepped
up
and
lost
then
they
came
back
and
asked
high
what
kind
of
a
game
he
was
playing
he
told
them
it
was
the
game
the
lady
wanted
to
know
why
he
called
it
because
i
have
two
chances
to
your
one
said
high
they
laughed
and
were
starting
away
when
they
noticed
me
turn
up
a
corner
on
one
of
the
cards
the
lady
nudged
her
husband
i
made
a
bet
of
and
won
it
the
gentleman
dropped
the
lady
arm
got
out
his
money
and
put
up
high
told
him
that
he
would
not
bet
less
than
but
the
gentleman
did
not
want
but
worth
then
his
tempted
him
saying
it
is
good
so
the
man
hearkened
unto
the
voice
of
his
wife
put
up
the
turned
a
card
and
lost
while
high
was
putting
away
the
money
i
grabbed
up
the
right
card
and
turned
up
the
corner
again
then
i
offered
to
bet
him
that
i
could
turn
the
winner
while
this
was
going
on
the
lady
was
giving
her
better
half
a
piece
of
her
mind
she
was
telling
him
that
he
was
a
fool
that
he
could
not
see
anything
and
that
she
could
turn
the
right
card
every
time
she
got
out
her
purse
took
out
in
gold
and
asked
him
how
much
money
he
had
left
he
told
her
she
said
give
it
to
me
and
i
will
show
you
that
a
woman
can
beat
a
man
every
time
i
was
counting
out
my
money
to
put
up
when
the
lady
asked
me
if
i
would
not
let
her
bet
first
i
said
certainly
for
i
knew
a
man
never
lost
anything
by
being
polite
to
the
ladies
and
in
this
particular
case
i
could
see
we
were
going
to
gain
high
told
her
he
never
bet
with
ladies
but
if
she
would
hand
the
money
to
her
husband
he
would
bet
with
him
him
says
she
he
ca
see
as
well
now
as
when
he
picked
me
out
for
a
wife
no
no
he
bet
any
of
my
money
all
right
says
high
so
she
put
up
the
money
high
put
up
the
same
amount
and
she
watched
him
as
though
she
was
afraid
he
was
not
going
to
put
up
the
full
after
mixing
them
up
a
little
high
said
ready
the
woman
took
up
the
card
turned
it
over
saw
it
and
then
threw
it
down
instead
of
giving
it
to
her
husband
that
he
also
could
see
she
then
took
her
husband
arm
and
said
come
away
eyes
are
if
we
stay
here
that
man
will
win
you
next
and
i
do
want
to
lose
you
if
you
are
a
fool
and
ca
see
as
well
now
as
when
we
were
married
we
had
a
good
laugh
took
something
and
then
high
said
george
that
woman
a
game
one
what
do
you
say
to
giving
her
back
the
gold
all
right
says
i
so
he
offered
me
the
and
wanted
me
to
return
it
i
told
him
i
was
not
afraid
of
any
man
but
said
i
that
woman
has
got
her
eyes
open
and
she
may
think
i
am
your
partner
no
george
says
he
you
closed
her
eyes
when
you
were
putting
up
that
and
gave
way
to
accommodate
a
lady
she
knows
you
are
a
gentleman
and
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
gamblers
except
to
do
them
the
favor
of
returning
money
they
had
won
from
suckers
his
fine
words
lured
me
into
the
trap
so
i
took
the
gold
and
found
the
lady
i
told
her
that
the
gambler
was
sorry
he
had
allowed
her
to
bet
and
had
requested
me
to
return
the
money
she
looked
at
me
a
moment
with
her
eyes
wide
open
and
said
i
will
greatly
multiply
thy
sorrow
by
refusing
to
accept
the
money
and
may
it
be
a
sorrow
to
you
gamblers
all
the
days
of
your
lives
the
my
old
partner
bush
and
i
would
play
the
trains
on
the
jackson
road
out
about
forty
miles
above
new
orleans
and
then
get
off
and
wait
for
a
down
train
some
times
we
would
be
compelled
to
get
off
before
we
had
gone
that
far
but
as
a
general
thing
it
would
be
about
that
distance
before
we
would
get
our
work
in
on
the
suckers
we
would
go
up
in
the
morning
to
a
place
called
manshak
and
fish
until
the
train
would
come
down
in
the
evening
one
day
we
were
fishing
and
had
got
some
distance
apart
when
i
saw
a
school
of
large
coming
down
like
lightning
i
jumped
up
and
grabbed
a
pike
pole
that
was
lying
near
slipped
the
noose
over
my
hand
and
let
fly
at
them
i
struck
a
big
fellow
but
he
did
not
stop
he
kept
right
on
and
pulled
me
in
after
him
i
yelled
to
bush
and
he
came
running
to
assist
me
he
reached
me
a
long
pole
and
then
pulled
me
out
the
rope
was
still
on
my
hand
and
the
fish
was
on
the
pike
pole
so
we
pulled
him
out
and
he
weighed
about
sixty
pounds
we
took
him
down
on
the
evening
train
and
had
a
part
of
him
broiled
for
our
supper
bush
said
it
was
the
largest
fish
he
ever
caught
i
told
him
i
caught
it
when
he
said
why
george
i
caught
you
both
red
and
black
i
have
been
in
some
big
games
in
my
day
and
have
always
been
ready
to
win
a
dollar
or
so
whenever
i
saw
a
chance
often
in
the
flush
times
after
the
war
i
have
stood
up
in
the
and
tossed
up
a
silver
dollar
or
a
gold
piece
heads
or
tails
for
from
a
hundred
to
five
hundred
dollars
a
throw
and
have
even
indulged
in
the
innocent
amusement
of
spitting
at
a
mark
the
money
of
course
going
to
the
one
that
came
nearest
the
spot
but
of
all
the
games
that
i
ever
ran
i
think
the
biggest
was
during
the
war
just
after
captain
leathers
had
purchased
the
elegant
steamer
the
soldiers
of
the
union
army
had
burned
his
fine
boat
the
the
story
illustrates
the
old
saying
that
one
good
turn
deserves
another
when
we
left
new
orleans
the
boat
was
full
of
passengers
and
the
trip
was
worth
to
the
boat
reaching
memphis
the
captain
soon
saw
that
his
chances
for
a
big
trip
were
the
best
that
he
had
ever
had
the
boat
was
loaded
to
the
guards
with
cotton
and
the
passenger
list
was
most
of
them
being
cotton
brokers
who
of
course
carried
a
great
deal
of
ready
money
with
them
after
supper
the
boat
laid
up
and
commenced
blowing
off
steam
i
stepped
up
to
the
captain
office
and
said
to
bob
owens
the
clerk
bob
what
up
what
the
boat
laying
here
for
we
are
in
a
fix
have
got
enough
money
in
the
office
to
pay
the
charges
on
the
cotton
it
too
late
to
get
anything
from
the
banks
and
we
shall
have
to
borrow
i
took
in
the
situation
in
a
twinkling
and
said
you
look
any
further
perhaps
i
can
let
you
have
all
you
want
face
brightened
up
as
he
said
i
can
get
along
with
in
ten
minutes
the
money
was
in
his
hands
and
the
boat
under
way
the
supper
was
over
and
tables
cleared
when
i
opened
out
my
game
of
et
and
it
started
in
big
at
once
there
were
players
and
the
smallest
money
on
the
table
was
fifty
dollars
at
the
end
of
every
deal
i
opened
four
bottles
of
wine
which
cost
me
twenty
dollars
as
the
sparkling
vintage
was
then
worth
five
dollars
a
bottle
there
was
one
man
at
the
table
who
got
pretty
full
and
finally
commenced
to
put
down
a
thousand
dollars
at
a
bet
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
him
roll
out
three
snapping
new
bills
and
put
them
down
at
first
i
supposed
he
was
a
paymaster
in
the
army
but
soon
learned
that
he
was
a
cotton
buyer
operating
for
a
rich
new
york
firm
everything
was
moving
on
swimmingly
when
up
came
a
contractor
from
memphis
whose
name
was
harper
he
was
a
knowing
sort
of
chap
perhaps
best
described
as
a
smart
aleck
he
began
to
nip
out
i
stood
it
for
some
time
but
finally
let
go
all
holds
and
started
after
him
and
soon
had
him
broke
though
in
doing
so
i
lost
that
i
had
won
from
the
new
york
party
then
he
began
to
kick
and
said
the
game
was
not
fair
that
he
was
going
to
have
his
money
back
and
threatened
to
bring
up
the
crew
of
men
that
he
had
on
board
who
had
been
working
on
the
levee
i
sent
a
message
to
the
mate
telling
him
what
to
watch
out
for
so
he
armed
all
of
the
boat
crew
roustabouts
and
all
with
clubs
and
stone
coal
and
stationed
them
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
brought
matters
to
a
the
contractor
men
weakened
and
the
players
who
were
the
heaviest
losers
wanted
the
throw
the
contractor
overboard
as
they
said
the
game
was
on
the
square
and
perfectly
fair
there
was
so
much
noise
made
however
that
the
passengers
began
to
come
out
of
their
the
captain
hurried
down
from
the
hurricane
roof
and
ominously
shook
his
head
so
i
cleared
the
game
and
all
was
quiet
once
more
i
settled
my
bar
bill
which
was
and
counting
over
my
money
found
i
was
exactly
winner
and
had
i
not
been
disturbed
or
molested
might
have
won
as
there
was
more
money
on
board
then
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
before
and
all
the
men
were
high
rollers
that
night
the
contractor
and
his
men
got
off
the
players
sobered
up
and
we
resumed
operations
but
the
playing
was
not
so
large
nor
the
players
so
venturesome
still
i
kept
the
game
open
till
we
reached
our
destination
and
came
out
a
few
thousands
more
ahead
he
never
knew
there
are
always
men
who
have
some
scheme
on
hand
some
trick
or
device
that
is
a
sure
winner
it
may
be
a
system
a
combination
marked
cards
or
something
of
the
sort
such
a
man
was
john
brogan
of
alexandria
his
stronghold
was
marked
cards
he
had
played
with
them
for
years
and
had
been
remarkably
successful
having
accumulated
considerable
property
i
was
once
coming
down
the
red
river
when
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
shrewd
fellow
named
neice
he
used
a
small
concave
reflector
about
the
size
of
a
gold
dollar
which
he
placed
in
the
pile
of
chips
before
him
and
which
in
dealing
the
cards
enabled
him
to
see
every
card
and
where
it
went
he
generally
played
with
gamblers
and
so
adroit
was
he
in
his
manipulations
that
they
were
unable
to
catch
him
i
made
up
my
mind
that
we
could
both
make
some
money
so
i
told
him
that
i
had
a
man
for
him
who
was
well
heeled
he
was
willing
to
help
me
and
we
started
for
alexandria
i
got
the
captain
to
land
about
three
miles
above
the
city
and
put
off
my
partner
whom
i
had
thoroughly
posted
when
i
reached
alexandria
i
went
at
once
to
the
ice
house
for
that
was
the
odd
name
given
to
the
hotel
where
i
soon
found
brogan
and
having
had
a
good
shake
of
the
hand
and
a
few
drinks
we
sat
down
for
a
social
chat
about
old
times
beguiling
away
the
time
with
choice
havanas
we
had
been
chatting
away
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
when
a
fellow
walked
into
the
and
asked
if
he
could
get
a
dram
i
come
a
good
distance
he
said
and
am
very
tired
the
fact
is
i
have
been
out
in
the
back
country
looking
up
a
mill
site
and
tramped
a
good
deal
more
than
i
calculated
take
something
with
me
my
friend
spoke
up
brogan
i
mind
and
we
all
three
took
a
drink
together
the
stranger
called
shortly
for
another
round
and
as
he
settled
pulled
out
a
roll
of
bills
as
big
as
a
pillow
that
at
once
caught
brogan
eyes
he
gave
me
a
significant
hunch
after
supper
the
miller
walked
into
the
purchased
a
cigar
and
walked
out
then
brogan
said
to
me
how
is
the
best
way
to
get
some
of
that
money
i
told
him
i
play
monte
for
you
perhaps
he
bite
at
that
john
hunted
around
and
soon
brought
the
miller
into
the
again
i
was
up
to
snuff
and
made
my
talk
and
showed
my
cards
and
john
won
from
me
then
the
miller
said
i
take
a
hand
he
lost
i
kept
on
playing
the
cards
but
the
miller
would
bet
no
more
remarking
to
me
i
think
you
are
a
sharper
john
then
asked
the
miller
if
he
ever
played
poker
oh
sometimes
i
used
to
play
for
a
quarter
ante
let
have
a
little
game
then
to
pass
away
time
the
game
began
and
brogan
trotted
out
his
marked
cards
i
insisted
on
playing
but
the
miller
said
no
that
i
was
too
smart
so
somewhat
crestfallen
i
walked
out
and
took
a
stroll
and
was
gone
perhaps
a
couple
of
hours
when
i
returned
they
were
playing
for
ten
dollars
ante
and
brogan
was
losing
very
fast
i
remained
around
the
card
table
only
for
a
short
time
and
then
went
away
when
i
came
back
the
miller
had
won
every
dollar
brogan
had
as
well
as
his
diamonds
amounting
to
something
like
brogan
came
to
me
and
wanted
to
borrow
i
said
certainly
you
can
have
it
but
john
you
are
drinking
too
much
take
my
advice
and
wait
till
morning
all
right
then
my
luck
will
change
of
course
and
that
miller
will
be
on
hand
late
that
night
a
boat
came
along
and
the
miller
skipped
out
morning
came
and
i
bade
john
brogan
poor
fellow
he
never
knew
why
his
marked
cards
did
work
and
i
never
told
him
both
john
brogan
and
neice
have
been
dead
many
years
and
i
trust
are
happy
in
the
spirit
land
perhaps
playing
marked
cards
and
concave
reflectors
with
peter
and
the
apostles
the
black
man
we
were
playing
monte
in
the
barber
shop
on
board
a
steamer
on
one
occasion
when
a
big
black
fellow
who
had
been
watching
the
game
through
the
window
asked
me
if
i
would
bet
with
a
black
man
i
had
never
gambled
with
the
niggers
for
in
those
days
they
were
nearly
all
slaves
and
had
but
little
money
and
i
was
looking
for
suckers
who
could
afford
to
lose
so
i
inquired
of
this
big
fellow
how
much
he
wanted
to
bet
he
said
i
bet
five
or
ten
dollars
i
replied
if
that
is
all
you
have
you
had
better
keep
it
for
i
do
want
to
win
a
black
man
money
anyway
that
got
his
african
blood
up
and
he
pulled
out
a
pretty
big
roll
saying
i
got
money
massa
if
i
is
a
black
man
i
saw
he
was
well
fixed
and
so
i
asked
him
how
he
made
his
money
he
replied
i
a
planter
sir
and
i
just
done
and
sold
my
cotton
i
took
out
ten
gold
pieces
and
said
i
will
bet
you
all
this
against
what
you
have
in
your
hand
oh
no
honey
says
he
i
got
dat
then
i
bet
you
this
i
said
pulling
out
a
note
he
put
his
money
down
and
turned
the
card
and
it
was
fun
to
see
him
open
that
big
mouth
roll
the
whites
of
his
eyes
up
and
then
throw
up
both
hands
ejaculating
laws
golly
if
dis
old
nigger
has
done
gone
and
lost
his
eyesight
sho
the
persuader
bluff
is
a
good
game
and
sometimes
it
will
turn
a
trick
when
everything
else
fails
i
boarded
morgan
railroad
as
it
was
called
upon
one
occasion
at
algiers
trains
on
that
road
were
generally
full
of
suckers
as
the
road
connected
with
the
galveston
steamers
at
burwick
bay
tom
brown
and
holly
chappell
my
partners
were
both
along
and
as
game
was
plenty
along
the
road
we
carried
our
shotguns
along
and
in
the
event
of
no
bigger
game
were
accustomed
to
get
off
and
shoot
snipe
catching
the
return
train
to
the
city
in
the
evening
sure
enough
there
was
a
party
of
traders
aboard
and
brown
lost
no
time
in
making
their
acquaintance
and
opening
out
one
of
them
commenced
to
cut
his
clothes
the
minute
he
got
a
glimpse
of
the
corner
after
chappell
made
one
cap
to
make
matters
more
binding
i
came
up
and
lost
then
the
ball
opened
and
it
was
not
more
than
half
and
hour
before
we
had
downed
the
party
then
the
devil
was
to
pay
one
of
the
party
said
look
here
i
must
have
my
money
back
or
h
l
will
flop
around
here
mighty
quick
then
they
all
joined
in
and
made
a
big
kick
and
as
i
saw
fun
brewing
i
slipped
into
the
changed
hats
and
coats
with
the
got
his
badge
and
my
shotgun
then
i
rushed
into
the
car
and
drew
the
bead
on
the
party
who
had
collected
around
the
boys
giving
a
and
demanding
in
stentorian
tones
who
has
been
playing
cards
in
this
car
i
have
said
brown
get
off
this
train
mighty
quick
and
i
pulled
the
rope
my
partners
lost
no
time
in
getting
off
pulling
the
rope
again
the
train
started
and
when
the
conductor
came
back
i
explained
that
somebody
would
have
been
hurt
had
i
not
acted
as
i
did
this
was
satisfactory
and
going
back
he
told
the
party
that
gambling
on
the
road
was
against
the
rules
and
that
he
could
have
them
all
arrested
when
the
bay
was
reached
if
he
wished
this
had
the
effect
of
quieting
them
down
especially
as
they
knew
that
the
man
who
had
won
their
money
was
off
the
train
i
was
not
long
in
reaching
the
and
returning
the
borrowed
articles
and
quietly
slipping
off
at
the
first
station
not
forgetting
my
shotgun
hunting
was
good
that
day
and
i
bagged
ten
snipe
and
thirteen
robbins
which
the
boys
helped
me
eat
at
our
old
friend
restaurant
on
gravier
street
opposite
the
charles
hotel
the
boys
all
agreed
that
my
conduct
was
all
that
saved
the
boodle
which
consisted
of
and
two
gold
watches
thus
it
is
that
a
little
management
backed
by
a
shotgun
and
an
official
badge
is
often
times
a
powerful
persuader
i
had
friends
i
was
coming
down
from
baton
rouge
one
night
in
a
boat
the
night
before
i
had
gone
up
and
had
been
pretty
lucky
so
i
resolved
to
try
and
reach
new
orleans
in
time
for
the
next
packet
mcgawley
my
partner
at
the
time
was
along
and
as
we
took
a
survey
of
the
passengers
we
noticed
that
most
of
them
were
raftsmen
who
had
just
been
paid
off
they
were
a
pretty
tough
lot
but
appeared
to
be
well
heeled
so
i
was
not
long
in
making
up
my
mind
to
see
the
color
of
their
money
i
managed
to
scrape
an
acquaintance
with
a
couple
of
them
and
invited
them
to
drink
then
i
proposed
a
game
of
euchre
to
which
both
agreed
we
made
it
handed
and
played
for
the
drinks
then
the
cigars
until
finally
i
resolved
to
feel
one
of
them
so
i
ran
him
up
a
hand
he
sat
on
my
left
and
ordered
me
up
i
gave
him
the
laugh
and
said
euchre
you
i
just
bet
you
you
do
he
quickly
replied
here
i
do
borrowing
of
his
partner
he
said
i
take
that
bet
of
course
i
euchred
him
as
i
said
i
would
but
the
game
broke
up
and
as
i
was
winner
i
paid
the
bar
bill
it
was
not
long
before
i
noticed
some
of
them
talking
suspiciously
together
among
themselves
and
i
deemed
it
the
part
of
prudence
to
slip
into
my
and
get
my
gun
for
then
i
was
not
particularly
disturbed
as
to
what
they
proposed
to
do
they
began
to
patronize
the
bar
pretty
extensively
and
asked
the
barkeeper
who
i
was
he
replied
that
he
did
not
know
they
said
that
one
of
the
negroes
had
said
that
i
was
a
gambler
and
they
were
going
to
lick
me
before
i
got
off
the
boat
the
barkeeper
soon
found
an
opportunity
to
tell
me
what
was
up
and
as
i
did
not
have
much
confidence
in
my
partner
as
a
fighter
i
concluded
i
was
in
for
it
i
knew
however
that
he
was
no
coward
and
if
he
was
attacked
would
fight
the
barkeeper
handed
me
a
billy
and
i
strolled
back
to
the
barber
shop
where
several
of
them
were
gathered
together
returning
through
the
cabin
to
the
bar
i
was
accosted
by
one
of
them
but
paid
no
attention
two
of
them
at
last
approached
me
as
i
stood
with
my
back
to
the
bar
when
one
of
them
remarked
i
do
think
you
won
that
money
fair
i
do
care
a
d
n
whether
i
did
or
not
i
quickly
retorted
so
he
cut
loose
at
me
and
i
caught
his
blow
on
my
arm
let
go
my
left
duke
and
downed
him
at
once
that
was
the
signal
for
the
circus
to
open
they
all
rushed
in
and
i
began
to
lay
them
out
as
fast
as
i
could
with
the
billy
every
whack
brought
blood
and
a
heavy
fall
mcgawley
and
the
barkeeper
took
a
hand
the
former
hurling
a
spittoon
that
cracked
a
fellow
head
open
and
sent
the
blood
spurting
while
the
latter
brought
a
bottle
on
a
skull
that
raised
a
welt
as
big
as
a
cocoanut
then
the
captain
rushed
in
and
the
mate
followed
with
a
gang
of
roustabouts
who
soon
had
quiet
restored
i
was
hit
pretty
hard
with
a
chair
otherwise
my
injuries
were
not
serious
i
did
not
use
my
revolver
as
none
were
drawn
for
i
never
wanted
to
kill
any
man
the
my
dear
old
mother
she
lived
to
be
years
old
god
bless
her
i
can
see
her
now
with
her
silvered
hair
and
tottering
step
she
used
to
pray
for
her
wild
son
george
and
on
one
occasion
i
guess
it
was
the
result
of
her
prayers
i
did
a
good
act
that
i
have
always
been
proud
of
and
i
received
the
prayers
of
all
the
ladies
of
the
church
for
it
i
was
in
the
south
at
the
time
and
on
board
a
packet
that
was
laid
up
at
natchez
for
a
few
hours
some
of
the
ladies
of
a
prominent
church
there
sent
down
a
magnificently
embroidered
wishing
to
raise
on
it
i
took
ten
chances
at
a
chance
and
then
circulated
among
the
passengers
and
easily
raised
a
good
sum
we
shook
the
box
and
one
of
my
throws
won
of
course
i
had
to
set
up
the
wine
but
i
put
up
the
robe
again
and
got
one
of
the
blackest
men
on
the
boat
to
throw
for
me
and
a
second
time
i
won
a
third
time
the
robe
went
up
and
this
time
for
good
but
not
until
was
realized
which
was
sent
to
the
delighted
ladies
i
think
that
money
spent
did
me
more
good
than
any
that
i
ever
squandered
for
i
was
the
recipient
of
the
thanks
as
well
as
the
prayers
of
the
ladies
the
preacher
away
from
home
ever
since
the
days
when
joseph
brothers
gambled
for
his
coat
of
many
colors
when
they
put
him
in
the
pit
the
desire
to
venture
in
games
of
chance
has
been
rampant
in
the
human
breast
and
even
men
of
the
cloth
have
proved
no
exception
to
the
rule
i
recall
an
instance
when
i
was
going
down
the
river
on
the
as
i
got
aboard
the
boat
i
said
to
myself
everything
looks
blue
got
no
partner
and
i
do
think
there
is
a
dollar
in
sight
i
scanned
over
the
faces
of
the
passengers
and
soon
found
one
of
the
old
boys
who
formerly
used
to
play
a
little
but
who
had
now
foresworn
cards
and
become
a
prominent
railroad
magnate
in
new
orleans
bob
and
myself
were
soon
talking
over
old
times
and
sipping
juleps
until
at
last
we
got
a
stack
of
chips
and
a
deck
of
cards
and
began
to
play
for
a
small
limit
presently
a
tall
portly
fine
looking
gentleman
came
up
to
the
table
and
appeared
to
be
so
interested
that
i
invited
him
to
take
a
hand
as
we
were
playing
for
a
small
limit
just
to
pass
away
time
he
readily
consented
and
the
game
went
on
smoothly
enough
when
i
ran
him
out
three
queens
and
helped
myself
to
three
kings
and
gave
bob
the
office
to
remain
in
as
i
wanted
him
to
lift
which
he
did
the
game
was
a
limit
and
at
last
we
got
him
in
for
about
fifty
dollars
before
the
draw
after
the
draw
things
livened
up
he
bet
two
dollars
bob
went
two
better
and
i
chipped
in
two
better
than
both
of
them
we
got
him
in
for
about
when
he
borrowed
and
we
still
kept
on
raising
him
until
we
were
confident
he
could
raise
no
more
money
hands
were
shown
and
the
portly
man
wilted
like
a
leaf
before
a
november
blast
but
never
even
murmured
a
kick
and
i
soon
knew
the
reason
why
for
captain
leathers
came
up
to
me
and
whispered
why
george
do
you
know
who
that
was
you
were
playing
with
i
do
not
he
a
preacher
i
have
heard
him
in
the
pulpit
many
a
time
and
i
know
that
he
stands
very
high
all
along
the
coast
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
his
gambling
here
i
never
mentioned
his
name
and
i
knew
the
captain
would
not
and
as
for
bob
he
never
say
a
word
for
he
was
afraid
i
give
the
snap
away
and
as
for
me
i
had
my
reasons
for
keeping
quiet
since
bob
was
always
generous
with
his
passes
and
john
kilkenny
would
have
the
laugh
on
him
for
all
are
now
strict
church
goers
a
shrewd
trick
some
men
are
born
rascals
some
men
have
rascality
thrust
upon
them
others
achieve
it
this
is
a
story
of
a
chap
that
i
think
must
have
had
a
birthmark
of
knavery
somewhere
concealed
about
his
body
it
was
during
the
war
and
i
was
going
up
on
the
steamer
captain
pratt
i
was
dealing
red
and
black
and
had
a
big
game
as
there
were
a
number
of
cotton
buyers
on
board
one
of
them
was
a
fine
appearing
gentleman
from
new
york
who
was
soon
loser
then
he
began
to
play
reckless
and
was
still
followed
by
his
bad
luck
i
noticed
his
nervousness
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
not
playing
with
his
own
money
finally
looking
up
he
said
how
much
will
you
turn
for
noticing
his
excited
condition
i
said
put
down
as
much
as
you
think
proper
and
if
you
go
too
high
i
tell
you
with
that
he
pulled
out
a
long
and
drawing
forth
a
roll
of
dollar
bills
threw
them
on
the
red
i
picked
up
the
money
and
counted
it
and
found
there
were
bills
that
beyond
my
limit
i
said
but
as
i
know
you
are
a
great
deal
heavier
loser
than
that
i
give
you
a
chance
to
get
even
so
crack
her
down
i
made
a
turn
he
lost
with
a
trembling
hand
and
wild
eye
he
counted
out
the
balance
of
his
money
and
laid
it
before
me
saying
this
is
my
last
bet
if
i
lose
there
is
and
there
is
more
will
you
turn
for
it
lay
her
up
was
all
i
said
down
it
went
just
as
any
would
do
if
he
had
some
one
else
money
he
lost
and
fell
back
in
his
chair
in
a
dead
faint
ice
water
was
brought
and
he
was
revived
after
the
game
he
came
to
me
and
said
not
a
dollar
of
that
money
was
my
own
it
belonged
to
a
wealthy
new
york
firm
one
of
the
members
of
which
i
was
to
meet
in
new
orleans
and
render
an
account
i
told
him
that
he
would
have
to
say
that
the
money
was
invested
in
cotton
that
would
be
shipped
in
a
few
days
that
will
give
you
time
to
skip
i
said
for
the
affair
is
bound
to
come
out
and
then
you
will
be
in
trouble
no
he
said
i
wo
run
away
i
have
thought
of
a
plan
that
will
let
me
out
of
the
scrape
there
is
another
man
on
the
boat
who
is
buying
for
the
same
firm
i
will
go
to
him
and
get
a
bundle
of
money
which
i
will
hand
to
you
privately
and
then
you
come
before
the
passengers
and
hand
it
to
me
you
can
say
want
your
money
so
here
it
is
take
it
i
will
thank
you
kindly
and
there
will
be
plenty
of
witnesses
to
say
that
i
did
not
lose
the
money
gambling
i
did
exactly
as
the
fellow
wanted
much
to
the
astonishment
of
the
passengers
who
said
that
i
must
either
be
the
man
in
the
country
or
the
biggest
fool
that
ever
ran
unhung
to
give
a
man
back
that
much
money
after
fairly
winning
it
when
new
orleans
was
reached
i
was
arrested
but
easily
proved
that
i
had
returned
the
money
or
rather
refused
to
take
it
and
was
discharged
but
the
good
old
greenbacks
were
safe
in
my
inside
pocket
all
the
same
mules
for
luck
in
the
flush
days
of
gambling
on
the
mississippi
i
used
to
take
everything
if
a
man
did
not
have
the
money
i
would
not
refuse
diamonds
or
a
stock
of
goods
on
one
occasion
when
i
was
going
from
memphis
to
cairo
on
the
of
a
little
game
was
started
and
i
won
ten
mules
a
bill
of
sale
was
drawn
up
but
when
i
went
to
land
the
mules
at
cairo
the
former
owner
began
to
kick
so
i
had
them
transferred
to
another
boat
that
was
lying
alongside
of
us
and
bound
for
louis
the
man
hated
to
part
with
his
mules
and
went
down
pawing
and
clamoring
among
them
until
one
of
them
gave
him
a
severe
kick
which
nearly
proved
fatal
at
last
they
doctored
him
up
so
he
could
talk
we
were
then
for
louis
but
i
was
too
smart
to
take
them
there
so
i
disembarked
at
cape
girardeau
and
sold
the
mules
at
a
reduced
price
for
what
did
a
gambler
want
with
a
pack
of
hungry
mules
trailing
around
after
him
anyhow
the
cattle
buyer
we
had
been
playing
monte
one
night
on
the
steamer
out
from
new
orleans
and
had
closed
up
my
partner
was
sitting
out
on
the
guards
and
i
was
in
the
hall
near
the
bar
when
i
saw
a
gentleman
coming
down
the
cabin
toward
me
i
stepped
up
and
ordered
a
drink
and
as
the
man
came
up
i
invited
him
to
join
me
he
accepted
and
we
entered
into
conversation
i
proposed
a
game
of
euchre
to
pass
the
time
he
assented
and
we
sat
down
he
proposed
to
play
for
ten
dollars
a
game
as
it
would
be
more
interesting
i
said
all
right
i
found
him
one
of
the
best
players
i
had
ever
met
he
beat
me
two
straight
games
and
i
saw
i
could
not
beat
him
on
the
square
so
i
began
to
complain
of
my
bad
luck
and
said
the
deck
was
unlucky
to
me
he
proposed
that
we
get
another
so
i
told
the
barkeeper
to
bring
us
a
new
deck
of
cards
which
he
did
and
when
he
put
them
on
the
table
i
saw
they
were
my
old
friends
at
this
time
my
partner
came
up
to
the
table
and
remarked
you
gentlemen
seem
to
be
enjoying
yourselves
i
replied
we
have
played
four
games
and
it
a
he
then
said
if
you
were
playing
poker
i
would
like
to
take
a
hand
the
gentleman
said
that
will
suit
me
if
you
are
satisfied
i
said
all
right
and
i
invited
my
partner
to
sit
in
which
he
did
we
bought
fifty
checks
each
at
a
dollar
apiece
and
commenced
playing
there
were
a
great
many
of
the
passengers
around
the
table
so
we
played
on
the
square
until
everybody
went
to
bed
and
left
us
alone
then
i
ran
him
up
three
large
jacks
and
gave
my
partner
three
queens
and
guarded
both
hands
so
that
nothing
could
drop
in
our
friend
was
on
my
left
and
had
up
a
big
blind
my
partner
just
saw
his
blind
i
exposed
my
hand
and
said
that
is
too
good
a
pot
to
lose
so
i
will
raise
you
gentlemen
our
friend
put
up
and
my
partner
said
i
believe
you
are
both
bluffing
i
see
that
and
raise
you
i
did
not
want
to
drive
our
friend
out
so
i
raised
he
put
up
and
we
came
to
a
draw
they
both
took
two
cards
and
i
stood
pat
with
a
high
it
was
my
partner
first
bet
he
hesitated
and
finally
bet
but
fifty
dollars
i
gave
them
one
of
those
old
laughs
and
said
boys
i
have
you
both
and
i
put
up
our
friend
saw
it
and
raised
back
my
partner
looked
at
his
hand
and
after
a
while
said
i
will
call
i
then
bet
cold
they
both
called
and
we
showed
down
the
three
queens
just
beat
the
three
jacks
and
i
said
i
was
trying
to
win
that
pot
on
a
bluff
our
friend
remarked
it
was
not
safe
to
bluff
when
such
hands
were
out
against
you
i
said
that
is
so
but
i
thought
you
were
both
bluffing
we
had
something
to
drink
and
started
in
again
i
ran
up
two
hands
giving
our
friend
three
aces
and
taking
four
tens
myself
i
did
not
give
my
partner
anything
as
i
wanted
him
to
do
the
tipping
the
betting
began
and
it
was
pretty
lively
when
we
came
to
the
draw
our
friend
took
two
cards
and
i
took
one
remarking
at
the
same
time
if
i
can
fill
this
flush
good
evening
to
you
fellows
the
betting
was
lively
and
finally
came
to
a
call
we
showed
down
and
i
took
in
our
friend
was
no
kicker
but
was
as
game
a
man
as
i
ever
met
he
got
up
laughed
and
said
gentlemen
let
take
a
drink
and
i
will
go
to
bed
he
bade
us
and
went
to
his
room
i
learned
during
our
play
that
he
was
a
large
cattle
buyer
from
texas
we
got
a
nice
slice
of
his
cattle
money
but
i
must
say
that
he
could
hold
his
own
with
anyone
in
a
square
game
of
poker
but
with
two
old
sharks
and
a
deck
of
marked
cards
there
is
no
man
that
can
win
much
money
as
his
bluffs
do
go
even
the
judges
do
it
the
love
of
gambling
is
confined
to
no
class
of
people
preachers
and
lawyers
doctors
and
men
of
business
are
as
susceptible
to
the
smiles
of
the
fickle
goddess
of
fortune
as
well
as
the
roughest
men
george
hardy
and
myself
were
once
going
from
jackson
mississippi
to
vicksburg
and
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
fell
to
talking
over
old
times
and
tricks
with
cards
near
by
sat
a
gentleman
who
appeared
interested
in
our
conversation
and
i
asked
george
who
it
was
as
i
had
often
seen
him
at
vicksburg
why
that
judge
and
he
introduced
me
pretty
soon
george
remarked
devol
you
ought
to
show
the
judge
the
baby
ticket
and
as
i
had
just
played
the
trick
for
a
joke
i
said
yes
judge
i
have
one
of
the
best
games
for
the
drinks
in
the
world
they
play
it
out
west
altogether
now
instead
of
dice
of
course
he
was
anxious
to
see
how
it
was
done
taking
out
some
cards
the
judge
was
greatly
amused
and
at
last
george
offered
to
bet
me
that
he
could
turn
the
card
i
took
him
up
and
he
lost
then
the
judge
not
at
all
discouraged
by
george
ill
luck
said
he
could
turn
it
up
for
but
i
told
him
i
did
not
want
to
bet
with
him
since
he
had
never
seen
the
game
before
at
last
i
consented
to
go
him
once
he
turned
the
card
and
lost
and
then
i
thought
that
george
would
die
with
laughter
this
only
riled
the
judge
who
was
now
bent
on
getting
even
so
he
put
up
his
gold
watch
and
chain
and
lost
them
he
was
satisfied
then
and
the
next
day
sent
around
a
friend
and
redeemed
them
george
remarked
the
judge
stands
very
high
in
this
vicinity
so
never
say
anything
about
this
transaction
and
as
i
never
did
i
do
not
suppose
george
did
george
had
no
idea
that
the
judge
would
bet
both
the
parties
are
still
living
and
will
when
they
see
this
in
cold
type
heartily
enjoy
the
story
no
play
on
this
boat
captain
dan
musselman
who
was
running
the
of
from
memphis
to
cairo
said
to
me
one
day
as
i
got
aboard
his
craft
at
memphis
george
i
do
want
you
to
play
that
monte
on
this
boat
all
right
i
replied
as
smiling
as
a
maid
of
sixteen
as
we
were
near
hickman
i
downed
a
fellow
in
the
barber
shop
for
the
trifling
sum
of
up
stairs
the
fellow
rushed
in
hot
haste
to
the
captain
to
try
and
get
his
money
back
i
remained
talking
with
captain
bill
thorwegon
of
louis
in
came
the
captain
and
said
george
did
you
win
this
man
money
yes
sir
i
did
as
frankly
as
a
school
boy
saying
his
catechism
did
i
not
tell
you
not
to
play
that
game
on
this
boat
yes
sir
but
captain
the
man
dared
me
to
bet
and
i
take
a
dare
from
any
man
well
you
have
to
go
ashore
at
hickman
the
boat
was
then
about
three
miles
below
and
i
had
a
faint
recollection
that
there
was
a
man
living
at
hickman
that
i
had
beat
only
a
short
time
before
so
i
said
to
the
captain
you
ca
land
her
too
quick
to
suit
me
put
her
into
the
bank
as
soon
as
you
can
captain
thorwegon
tried
to
dissuade
me
but
i
was
obstinate
and
insisted
on
being
landed
at
once
dunlap
my
partner
was
ripping
mad
at
my
obstinacy
as
it
was
dark
raining
and
in
the
woods
out
went
the
gang
plank
however
and
we
on
it
armed
with
some
matches
cigars
and
a
bottle
of
whisky
a
big
tree
was
soon
found
a
fire
started
and
after
patronizing
the
whisky
bottle
and
sampling
the
cigars
we
turned
in
for
the
night
towards
morning
i
was
awakened
by
a
noise
and
found
that
dunlap
my
partner
was
on
fire
i
woke
him
up
and
rushed
him
down
into
the
river
only
a
distance
of
about
fifty
feet
and
he
came
out
looking
like
the
worst
tramp
that
ever
was
on
the
road
his
coat
was
burned
off
and
also
one
leg
of
his
pantaloons
so
he
walked
to
hickman
and
purchased
new
clothes
and
boarding
the
first
boat
down
induced
the
captain
to
stop
for
me
and
we
returned
to
memphis
ahead
but
sadder
and
wiser
men
the
green
i
always
had
a
great
love
for
and
it
is
many
a
dollar
i
have
won
and
lost
on
the
turf
in
flush
times
just
after
the
war
i
was
taking
a
lot
of
over
to
mobile
and
had
got
them
all
nicely
quartered
on
the
boat
and
was
taking
a
smoke
on
the
when
a
stranger
approached
me
are
you
the
gentleman
who
brought
those
horses
over
from
new
orleans
yes
sir
there
is
one
that
i
would
like
to
buy
and
that
one
the
pacing
horse
ca
sell
him
need
him
in
the
races
that
i
giving
every
week
at
supper
we
sat
together
and
after
supper
we
chatted
for
a
long
time
my
partner
sat
near
by
and
knew
what
i
was
nursing
him
for
he
let
me
know
that
he
was
from
texas
and
towards
i
asked
him
if
he
played
euchre
he
loved
the
game
very
much
and
played
a
great
deal
suppose
we
amuse
ourselves
if
we
can
find
a
deck
of
cards
i
suggested
and
we
sat
down
playing
handed
until
most
of
the
passengers
had
retired
when
i
took
out
my
watch
at
a
rough
looking
fellow
unshaven
and
haired
with
a
huge
buffalo
bill
hat
on
his
head
came
up
to
the
table
and
said
he
was
from
texas
and
had
never
been
in
this
part
of
the
country
before
what
part
of
texas
are
you
from
asked
my
friend
who
appeared
to
be
taken
with
the
green
country
manners
of
the
texan
wall
i
live
on
a
ranch
odd
miles
from
el
paso
what
brought
you
so
far
away
from
home
me
and
my
pap
came
over
with
cattle
sir
and
they
all
over
in
pens
in
new
orleans
i
reckoned
as
how
we
lose
all
coming
across
the
sea
and
pap
was
skeered
so
he
never
went
to
bed
till
we
got
them
steers
in
the
pens
i
did
want
to
go
with
pap
when
he
started
with
them
thar
steers
but
pap
is
the
oldest
and
i
had
to
mind
him
but
what
did
you
come
to
mobile
for
well
i
tell
you
i
got
talking
to
a
fellar
and
he
told
me
that
if
i
would
go
over
with
him
on
the
ship
that
he
would
buy
all
my
critters
so
i
asked
pap
if
i
might
go
and
he
said
yes
but
i
kinder
sorry
i
went
now
for
i
got
lost
from
that
fellar
and
never
laid
eyes
on
him
after
we
got
over
thar
he
told
me
to
pay
his
fare
and
when
he
got
over
thar
he
would
give
me
back
the
money
but
i
reckon
he
went
after
the
money
and
got
lost
but
i
haint
going
to
say
a
word
to
pap
for
i
got
to
pranking
with
a
fellow
on
the
ship
and
i
be
if
i
did
lose
but
pap
wo
find
it
out
for
i
had
what
i
been
saving
to
buy
me
a
ranch
and
i
sha
tell
pap
anything
about
it
how
did
you
come
to
lose
your
money
stranger
i
asked
wall
look
here
i
never
seen
such
a
thing
he
had
some
tickets
and
he
would
mix
up
sorter
jumble
together
and
then
he
would
bet
you
that
you
could
lift
the
one
that
had
the
little
baby
on
it
so
i
just
watched
it
and
i
just
cut
my
coat
to
get
the
money
for
mam
she
sewed
it
up
before
i
started
well
i
just
laid
down
my
greenbacks
and
i
did
lift
the
boy
and
he
kept
my
greenbacks
then
he
went
off
and
left
his
tickets
lying
on
the
bench
so
i
going
to
take
them
home
with
me
but
i
wo
tell
i
lost
anything
let
me
see
them
i
said
will
you
give
back
oh
certainly
so
he
pulled
them
out
and
my
friend
and
myself
had
never
seen
anything
like
them
before
so
i
said
show
us
how
he
did
the
trick
he
showed
us
the
best
he
could
then
i
caught
up
the
one
with
the
boy
on
it
and
turned
the
corner
and
showed
it
to
my
friend
and
gave
him
a
quiet
hunch
under
the
table
as
i
laid
it
down
and
asked
if
he
would
bet
on
it
he
said
when
i
get
back
home
i
going
to
larn
it
so
i
can
win
all
the
money
i
want
will
you
bet
a
drink
that
i
ca
guess
it
the
first
time
i
said
he
mixed
them
up
and
observed
i
go
you
a
dram
i
bet
and
my
friend
was
pleased
to
see
what
a
fool
i
was
and
i
told
my
friend
to
bet
him
another
dram
that
he
could
pick
it
up
but
i
said
do
touch
the
one
that
has
the
corner
turned
up
and
he
did
as
i
said
that
made
the
laugh
who
broke
out
in
his
peculiar
vernacular
oh
you
old
fools
with
store
clothes
on
ca
tell
it
no
how
then
i
observed
to
my
friend
i
am
going
to
have
some
of
that
money
for
that
fool
will
never
get
back
for
some
one
will
win
it
sure
i
began
jesting
and
playing
the
fellow
till
at
last
i
dared
him
to
bet
me
on
it
and
he
said
i
wo
take
a
dare
and
pulled
out
about
in
greenbacks
all
in
bills
i
laid
my
on
the
table
all
in
small
bills
so
when
he
commenced
to
put
up
his
i
counted
him
out
of
and
that
made
it
two
to
one
but
i
turned
the
card
and
he
told
my
friend
to
just
hand
me
the
money
what
is
the
least
you
will
bet
said
my
friend
to
the
wall
boys
you
have
got
me
at
it
and
i
had
just
as
leave
bet
it
all
but
i
know
you
fellars
with
the
store
clothes
on
haint
got
that
much
and
i
knows
you
darnt
bet
a
dollar
if
you
did
the
old
woman
would
broomstick
yer
my
friend
could
not
stand
this
sort
of
racket
any
longer
for
i
kept
telling
him
to
just
lay
up
his
money
and
take
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
at
this
stage
of
the
game
a
tall
fine
looking
fellow
with
long
black
whiskers
came
up
and
said
i
bet
that
i
can
turn
the
card
the
observed
if
i
can
win
that
bet
i
be
even
on
what
i
lost
going
over
so
he
put
the
money
up
and
said
come
on
go
yer
and
the
man
put
up
his
money
and
turned
the
wrong
card
the
was
delighted
my
friend
trembled
for
he
saw
that
the
new
comer
did
not
take
the
one
with
the
corner
turned
up
of
course
he
began
to
get
his
money
out
and
he
had
lots
of
the
long
green
stuff
for
he
was
a
large
cotton
buyer
from
galveston
he
offered
to
bet
but
the
said
i
wo
bet
less
than
i
offered
to
take
half
but
the
boy
would
only
bet
with
one
person
at
a
time
so
i
told
him
to
lay
it
up
he
did
so
and
turned
the
card
but
missed
the
winner
i
grabbed
up
the
boy
ticket
and
turned
the
corner
so
quickly
that
he
supposed
he
had
made
a
mistake
the
man
at
once
pulled
out
his
money
and
bet
him
again
and
this
time
he
won
my
friend
wanted
to
try
it
again
for
i
made
him
believe
that
he
made
the
mistake
himself
he
said
shuffle
them
up
and
i
will
make
you
one
more
bet
he
counted
out
another
and
says
i
that
will
only
make
you
even
if
you
win
so
he
took
out
more
which
was
all
he
had
except
perhaps
in
small
bills
the
cards
were
shuffled
the
counted
out
his
money
the
man
wanted
to
chip
in
enough
to
make
it
even
but
the
would
have
it
my
friend
made
a
snatch
at
what
he
supposed
was
the
boy
card
and
lost
i
felt
very
sorry
for
him
the
fellow
with
the
black
whiskers
was
holly
chappell
the
was
tom
brown
both
were
my
partners
the
invited
us
all
to
the
bar
my
friend
and
i
retired
to
our
for
the
night
no
money
in
law
a
man
by
the
name
of
levy
of
course
he
was
a
jew
and
myself
were
once
traveling
on
the
jackson
railroad
amusing
ourselves
playing
in
the
smoking
car
when
along
came
a
horseman
from
new
orleans
and
dropped
in
thinking
he
could
pick
up
the
right
card
i
was
doing
the
playing
and
i
asked
the
horseman
if
he
thought
he
could
pick
out
the
card
with
the
baby
on
he
said
that
was
just
what
he
could
do
for
put
her
up
i
said
and
in
a
twinkling
i
covered
his
he
turned
the
card
and
lost
then
he
studied
for
a
moment
and
remarked
i
am
going
to
try
that
once
more
so
he
planked
down
his
watch
which
was
a
fine
howard
movement
worth
about
he
lost
got
mad
and
kicked
by
telegraphing
ahead
to
arrest
a
couple
of
gamblers
on
the
train
who
had
been
robbing
a
man
we
were
then
a
few
miles
below
the
mile
siding
and
i
knew
there
were
no
officers
there
so
we
got
off
at
the
siding
and
on
the
down
train
we
spied
an
officer
who
was
coming
from
winona
after
us
then
we
took
to
the
hills
and
kept
a
sharp
lookout
where
we
could
see
and
not
be
seen
the
officer
asked
where
we
had
gone
and
the
railroad
people
told
them
down
the
road
they
returned
to
winona
and
he
offered
a
reward
of
fifty
dollars
for
the
watch
and
for
the
return
of
the
watch
and
money
bad
news
travels
fast
and
i
soon
heard
of
this
and
i
decided
not
to
go
so
high
up
on
the
road
at
last
however
i
went
to
the
town
though
before
i
reached
the
depot
i
handed
my
money
to
a
gentleman
who
resided
there
who
was
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
sure
enough
as
i
expected
the
constable
served
his
warrant
on
me
immediately
my
friend
at
once
stepped
up
and
said
that
we
would
not
go
to
jail
and
forthwith
furnished
bail
we
gave
the
officer
the
laugh
who
only
got
mad
and
telegraphed
to
new
orleans
that
he
had
the
party
who
had
won
the
watch
and
money
belonging
to
the
horseman
on
the
first
train
up
he
came
when
the
case
was
called
for
trial
i
asked
the
judge
for
a
continuance
on
account
of
the
absence
of
a
material
witness
he
granted
me
one
of
three
days
the
horseman
then
offered
to
compromise
if
we
would
return
the
watch
and
money
failing
in
this
he
fell
to
abusing
the
judge
for
granting
us
a
continuance
this
reached
the
ears
of
the
judge
who
was
anything
but
pleased
and
when
i
had
an
opportunity
i
told
the
judge
that
if
he
wanted
i
would
stand
trial
for
gambling
and
be
fined
although
i
was
aware
that
he
had
no
jurisdiction
in
gambling
cases
but
i
presumed
that
he
and
the
constable
wanted
to
make
a
piece
for
themselves
the
trial
came
off
and
the
judge
fined
us
thirty
dollars
apiece
for
gambling
my
friend
paid
the
fines
and
then
i
turned
to
the
judge
and
demanded
a
warrant
for
the
horseman
for
gambling
in
the
state
he
too
was
fined
thirty
dollars
and
when
he
returned
to
new
orleans
and
told
his
story
the
boys
all
gave
him
the
laugh
and
told
him
he
had
better
have
staid
at
home
for
we
all
told
you
that
you
could
never
get
a
cent
back
from
devol
when
i
reached
new
orleans
i
hunted
the
horseman
up
and
he
redeemed
his
watch
giving
me
this
transaction
made
a
man
of
him
for
afterwards
i
met
him
and
he
wanted
to
help
me
skin
suckers
and
did
make
money
many
business
men
whom
i
have
at
first
won
money
from
came
to
me
afterwards
and
stood
in
with
the
game
so
that
i
was
given
an
opportunity
to
get
into
games
that
i
never
could
have
done
without
their
influence
the
police
signal
they
have
a
signal
service
on
board
the
vessels
running
from
new
orleans
to
other
points
on
the
gulf
by
which
they
can
notify
those
on
shore
what
is
wanted
some
time
before
the
vessel
reaches
the
landing
if
they
run
up
the
police
flag
there
will
be
twenty
or
more
police
at
the
wharf
when
the
vessel
arrives
we
would
play
one
vessel
out
to
some
point
of
landing
and
then
wait
for
another
to
bring
us
back
we
had
played
a
boat
over
to
mobile
at
one
time
and
was
on
our
way
back
when
we
got
a
fellow
down
in
a
game
of
euchre
several
times
during
the
progress
of
the
game
remarks
had
been
made
about
good
poker
hands
so
i
ran
the
gentleman
up
the
old
hand
of
four
queens
and
an
ace
he
picked
it
up
and
said
i
have
a
poker
hand
i
turned
my
head
to
spit
and
in
doing
so
i
purposely
exposed
or
tipped
my
hand
so
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
it
i
then
said
how
much
will
you
bet
he
replied
fifty
dollars
i
then
raised
him
my
partner
said
gentlemen
as
this
is
a
game
of
bluff
i
will
raise
you
i
threw
down
my
hand
remarking
i
started
in
to
bluff
you
out
but
you
fellows
are
too
much
for
me
the
gentleman
then
said
you
ca
bluff
me
i
will
call
the
bet
they
showed
down
but
the
fellow
four
queens
and
an
ace
were
not
enough
for
my
partner
had
four
large
live
kings
and
he
took
down
the
money
the
fellow
got
up
and
raised
a
h
l
of
a
kick
and
finally
when
he
saw
he
could
get
nothing
back
he
went
to
the
captain
and
told
him
we
had
stolen
his
money
the
captain
was
a
stranger
to
me
so
i
could
do
nothing
with
him
he
ordered
the
police
flag
to
be
run
up
and
then
we
knew
we
would
be
arrested
when
we
reached
new
orleans
i
did
not
fear
the
result
if
we
could
get
rid
of
our
money
but
i
did
not
want
the
fellow
to
get
a
chance
at
that
i
commenced
looking
around
and
soon
found
a
friend
i
could
trust
so
i
gave
him
all
the
money
my
partner
and
i
had
and
then
i
did
not
care
how
quick
they
nabbed
me
when
we
started
off
the
boat
we
were
met
by
about
twenty
police
the
kicker
was
there
and
when
he
saw
us
he
pointed
me
out
and
said
there
is
one
of
them
the
officers
laughed
when
they
saw
us
for
they
knew
me
we
got
into
a
cab
and
went
up
to
the
court
which
was
then
in
session
they
searched
us
but
only
found
a
few
dollars
i
employed
a
lawyer
and
in
about
ten
minutes
we
were
free
but
if
we
had
not
got
away
with
the
stuff
we
would
have
had
more
trouble
as
he
was
ready
to
replevy
after
being
released
we
started
out
to
find
our
friend
and
when
we
got
our
money
we
had
more
wine
than
was
good
for
our
heads
i
have
often
seen
the
police
flag
run
up
but
always
managed
someway
to
keep
from
giving
up
the
boodle
if
i
could
find
no
friend
to
trust
it
with
before
we
landed
i
would
find
one
in
the
officers
or
the
cab
boys
and
not
one
of
then
ever
went
back
on
me
a
paymaster
bluff
the
yellow
fever
was
raging
in
the
south
in
and
nearly
every
one
was
trying
to
reach
the
seaboard
as
it
is
considered
that
the
disease
is
not
so
violent
there
on
the
steamer
to
mobile
one
night
a
big
game
was
in
progress
ten
dollars
was
the
ante
no
limit
i
was
loser
and
soon
resolved
that
i
must
stir
myself
and
do
something
there
was
no
time
to
lose
so
hurrying
to
the
bar
upon
some
excuse
i
got
a
deck
such
as
they
were
using
and
ran
up
four
hands
being
careful
that
i
got
the
best
of
it
returning
i
played
fully
half
an
hour
before
i
came
out
with
my
deck
at
last
it
came
my
deal
and
i
gave
them
threes
and
let
them
fill
it
would
have
brought
a
smile
to
a
dead
man
to
have
seen
them
bet
for
they
put
up
all
the
money
they
had
and
one
of
them
went
to
the
office
and
bringing
out
a
valise
said
as
he
laid
it
on
the
table
there
is
in
that
valise
and
i
raise
all
of
you
that
much
what
to
do
i
did
not
know
i
was
in
a
quandary
when
quick
as
thought
a
plan
flashed
upon
me
i
jumped
up
and
rushing
to
the
office
got
all
the
small
bills
they
had
mostly
ones
and
twos
and
securing
a
piece
of
brown
paper
wrapped
these
bills
around
it
which
made
an
enormous
roll
there
was
a
five
bill
on
the
outside
and
putting
a
strip
of
paper
around
it
i
marked
it
then
rushing
up
i
said
boys
i
have
at
last
raised
the
money
and
as
i
was
about
to
put
it
on
the
table
to
call
the
bet
the
owner
of
the
valise
snatched
it
off
saying
that
was
only
for
a
bluff
so
i
deemed
it
best
to
show
down
for
what
money
we
had
up
as
i
knew
all
the
rest
were
up
all
they
had
and
i
have
always
made
it
a
rule
never
to
bet
a
man
more
than
he
had
to
run
him
out
but
always
to
give
every
man
a
chance
for
his
money
turning
to
the
fellow
with
the
valise
i
said
i
will
bet
you
on
a
side
bet
that
my
hand
beats
yours
he
counted
out
the
money
and
put
it
up
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
show
hands
but
in
the
draw
i
took
in
another
nine
which
made
four
and
a
five
spot
that
broke
up
the
game
as
that
was
all
the
money
except
what
the
man
with
the
valise
and
i
had
and
he
got
cold
for
the
money
he
was
playing
with
belonged
to
the
government
he
was
a
paymaster
and
had
i
won
his
money
i
should
undoubtedly
have
got
into
trouble
again
paymasters
in
the
army
were
among
the
best
suckers
we
ever
had
and
i
fear
we
never
shall
have
such
fat
plucking
again
prankin
with
a
new
game
i
had
a
partner
at
one
time
by
the
name
of
tripp
and
he
was
one
of
the
smartest
gamblers
i
ever
worked
with
he
would
play
any
and
all
games
of
chance
and
would
play
them
as
high
as
any
man
in
the
country
and
come
as
near
winning
all
the
time
at
most
of
them
he
was
a
good
clever
fellow
he
and
i
were
on
the
michigan
southern
railroad
at
one
time
tripp
was
to
do
the
playing
with
the
three
cards
and
i
was
to
be
on
the
i
began
my
part
of
the
business
and
in
looking
around
i
saw
an
old
gentleman
that
i
thought
might
be
well
fixed
in
money
matters
and
if
he
was
i
judged
he
would
be
a
good
subject
so
i
sat
down
and
opened
up
conversation
i
told
him
i
was
a
miner
from
colorado
that
i
had
some
of
the
richest
mines
in
the
country
and
that
i
was
on
my
way
to
washington
to
take
out
a
patent
on
a
crushing
machine
that
i
had
invented
he
became
very
much
interested
and
i
learned
that
he
was
from
the
state
of
michigan
and
was
very
well
fixed
in
this
world
goods
i
gave
him
some
big
talk
about
the
mining
business
telling
him
i
often
took
out
a
day
and
much
more
of
the
same
sort
he
did
not
let
me
do
all
the
blowing
but
gave
me
to
understand
that
while
he
was
not
taking
out
of
mother
earth
per
day
he
was
and
had
been
for
many
years
getting
out
of
the
ground
quite
a
number
of
thousands
while
we
were
telling
each
other
how
much
money
we
had
accumulated
for
a
rainy
day
a
came
up
and
took
the
seat
just
in
front
of
us
and
in
a
few
moments
he
turned
around
and
said
be
you
gentlemen
going
to
new
york
the
old
gentleman
said
i
am
but
this
gentleman
is
going
to
washington
city
i
be
going
to
new
york
with
my
steers
for
them
fellars
in
chicago
wo
pay
my
price
and
some
of
them
beat
me
out
of
in
less
than
no
time
said
the
i
then
told
him
to
turn
his
seat
over
and
tell
us
how
they
got
his
money
he
got
up
turned
his
seat
and
said
they
had
some
kind
of
a
game
that
they
bet
on
i
got
to
pranking
with
it
and
i
just
lost
afore
you
could
say
jack
robinson
it
must
have
been
or
some
game
of
cards
said
i
it
was
no
for
i
reckon
as
how
i
can
play
with
any
of
the
boys
well
tell
us
about
the
game
said
the
old
gentleman
the
then
took
out
an
old
dirty
rag
which
i
suppose
he
called
a
handkerchief
unfolded
it
and
produced
three
cards
saying
them
thar
fellows
gave
me
these
ar
cards
and
i
going
to
larn
that
ar
game
so
as
when
i
get
back
to
texas
i
can
beat
all
the
boys
i
told
him
to
show
us
how
they
could
bet
on
three
cards
then
he
bent
them
up
and
began
throwing
them
on
the
seat
beside
him
saying
at
the
same
time
i
not
as
good
at
it
as
those
chicago
chaps
but
i
going
to
practice
and
when
i
get
down
in
texas
i
get
even
on
our
boys
i
asked
him
if
they
got
all
his
money
oh
no
i
just
got
loads
of
money
and
then
when
i
sell
them
thar
steers
in
new
york
i
reckon
i
will
have
some
more
now
you
see
this
card
has
got
an
old
man
on
it
and
you
have
to
guess
this
one
or
you
lose
we
guessed
a
few
times
and
then
i
bent
up
the
corner
of
the
old
man
card
saying
to
the
michigan
gentleman
now
we
will
have
some
fun
then
i
said
to
the
will
you
bet
money
on
the
game
yourself
i
ca
play
it
good
enough
yet
to
bet
but
as
i
have
two
cards
to
your
one
i
would
just
as
soon
bet
on
it
as
on
a
pony
race
and
i
often
put
up
big
money
on
a
pony
i
told
the
michigander
not
to
turn
up
the
card
with
the
corner
turned
up
so
long
as
we
were
guessing
for
fun
so
he
turned
up
one
of
the
other
cards
and
the
said
you
see
you
are
just
as
big
fools
as
i
was
in
chicago
i
then
said
i
will
bet
you
that
i
can
turn
up
the
old
man
the
first
time
i
told
the
old
gentleman
that
we
might
as
well
get
some
of
his
money
as
he
would
lose
it
anyway
before
he
got
back
to
texas
finally
the
took
out
another
dirty
rag
unrolled
it
and
displayed
a
roll
of
money
the
size
of
one
leg
he
counted
out
saying
i
go
you
once
for
i
do
any
man
to
back
me
out
he
mixed
the
cards
up
and
i
turned
up
the
one
with
the
bent
corner
and
won
the
money
the
laughed
and
said
well
i
be
gol
darned
if
you
did
get
me
you
must
have
right
smart
eyes
for
i
swan
i
know
which
one
it
was
myself
the
old
gentleman
asked
if
he
would
bet
with
him
oh
yes
you
are
old
and
ca
see
like
this
feller
said
he
do
be
so
sure
about
me
not
being
able
to
see
well
replied
the
old
man
you
could
keep
the
run
of
them
like
this
fellow
and
then
i
guess
as
how
you
have
got
much
money
said
the
the
old
gent
then
got
out
his
leather
and
it
was
chuck
full
of
big
bills
he
took
out
and
put
it
up
in
my
hands
the
told
him
he
would
not
bet
less
than
and
said
he
the
indians
bet
that
on
a
down
where
i
live
i
told
the
old
gent
it
would
serve
the
fellow
just
right
if
he
would
win
all
his
money
so
he
put
up
the
turned
a
card
and
lost
i
snatched
up
the
old
man
card
and
turned
up
the
corner
again
then
said
how
in
the
name
of
common
sense
did
you
come
to
make
that
mistake
why
i
turned
the
one
with
the
corner
up
says
he
no
you
did
not
for
here
it
is
i
said
picking
up
the
winner
the
old
fellow
thought
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
the
told
him
he
could
see
well
for
he
was
too
old
i
then
told
him
to
mix
them
up
and
i
would
bet
him
he
did
so
and
i
won
then
the
man
from
michigan
got
out
what
he
had
left
amounting
to
and
said
this
is
all
i
have
with
me
but
i
will
bet
it
he
turned
a
card
but
again
he
lost
he
then
settled
back
in
his
seat
as
though
he
was
going
to
stay
right
there
and
i
do
believe
he
would
have
got
out
if
the
car
had
run
off
the
track
the
put
his
cards
back
into
the
dirty
rag
and
remarked
i
be
gol
darned
if
i
haint
larning
to
play
this
game
nigh
like
them
chicago
chaps
and
if
i
had
been
pranking
with
you
feller
with
the
smart
eyes
i
reckon
i
would
have
been
about
even
he
got
up
bid
us
and
started
out
we
sat
there
talking
about
the
tricks
for
a
short
time
when
in
came
my
partner
tripp
all
dressed
up
so
that
no
one
would
suspicion
that
he
was
ever
a
i
introduced
him
to
the
old
gentleman
from
michigan
but
he
was
not
near
so
talkative
as
he
was
when
we
first
got
acquainted
i
did
not
want
to
hurt
his
feelings
so
i
did
not
say
anything
about
the
game
before
my
partner
and
i
believe
the
old
fellow
was
glad
of
it
for
he
looked
just
as
if
he
would
rather
no
one
but
that
d
d
and
myself
should
know
what
a
sucker
he
had
been
when
we
changed
cars
we
bid
him
and
i
said
if
you
see
that
fool
with
the
steers
in
new
york
tell
him
not
to
go
pranking
any
more
new
games
or
he
will
lose
all
his
money
he
looked
at
me
in
such
a
way
that
i
believe
he
did
not
want
to
see
him
although
he
did
not
say
so
caught
a
defaulter
it
is
a
singular
fact
that
most
of
the
men
who
turn
out
embezzlers
defaulters
and
dishonest
clerks
sooner
or
later
lose
their
money
gambling
oftentimes
it
is
their
love
of
cards
that
induces
them
to
commit
the
crimes
they
do
i
very
well
recollect
a
number
of
instances
of
this
kind
and
one
in
particular
i
was
going
up
the
river
on
board
the
when
i
received
a
card
requesting
me
to
call
at
room
no
the
name
was
written
in
a
business
hand
so
i
knew
the
card
was
from
a
gentleman
when
i
knocked
a
voice
said
come
in
upon
entering
i
saw
a
young
man
that
i
knew
very
well
who
was
a
bookkeeper
in
one
of
the
largest
cotton
houses
in
new
orleans
i
at
once
inquired
what
he
was
keeping
himself
locked
up
in
his
room
for
and
he
replied
i
am
afraid
to
show
up
in
the
cabin
but
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
before
you
get
off
as
he
knew
that
i
rarely
went
above
baton
rouge
late
at
night
he
came
out
of
his
so
completely
disguised
that
i
did
not
know
him
we
took
several
drinks
together
until
he
began
to
feel
jolly
then
i
asked
him
what
he
was
up
to
well
he
replied
i
have
been
playing
the
bank
and
poker
for
some
time
and
have
been
several
thousand
dollars
loser
and
i
knew
sooner
or
later
the
books
would
be
overhauled
so
i
collected
some
money
and
skipped
here
i
am
and
what
to
do
i
do
know
nor
where
i
shall
wind
up
oh
there
are
plenty
of
people
in
the
same
box
that
you
are
i
said
do
flatter
yourself
that
you
are
the
only
one
who
has
taken
money
but
perhaps
they
will
now
go
through
the
books
and
discovering
the
deficit
arrest
you
yes
but
i
do
intend
to
be
caught
i
think
i
will
go
to
canada
i
am
now
traveling
under
an
assumed
name
are
you
sure
none
of
the
discharging
clerks
saw
you
when
you
came
aboard
i
was
in
this
disguise
and
came
over
two
boats
until
i
reached
this
one
and
having
a
friend
with
me
he
secured
a
room
for
two
how
much
did
you
get
away
with
hundred
dollars
which
he
had
collected
the
day
before
he
left
he
proposed
going
out
and
shaking
the
dice
for
the
drinks
i
stuck
him
again
and
again
and
at
last
he
proposed
to
shake
for
five
dollars
that
suited
me
and
when
he
proposed
to
shake
for
ten
dollars
i
was
ready
then
i
began
to
work
on
him
for
i
thought
i
might
as
well
have
that
money
as
anybody
as
i
knew
he
would
gamble
and
never
reach
canada
with
it
i
suggested
that
we
go
to
my
as
the
was
too
public
a
place
and
he
acceded
in
half
and
hour
we
were
throwing
for
a
hundred
dollars
a
throw
and
when
i
quit
i
was
ahead
as
i
knew
that
it
would
not
do
to
win
it
all
from
him
so
i
told
him
that
i
was
sleepy
and
tired
we
took
a
drink
at
the
bar
and
he
drank
so
heavily
that
i
was
obliged
to
tell
the
porter
to
see
him
to
his
room
i
knew
that
he
must
have
money
to
go
out
of
the
country
and
it
would
not
do
to
break
him
as
i
would
then
have
to
loan
him
money
we
were
then
miles
from
baton
rouge
and
i
slept
on
a
couple
of
chairs
in
the
cabin
and
was
awakened
by
my
partner
who
wanted
to
know
if
i
wanted
to
sleep
forever
as
i
had
retired
with
him
but
unable
to
sleep
had
risen
when
i
told
my
partner
of
the
roll
i
had
made
he
said
that
i
was
the
luckiest
man
he
ever
saw
but
i
told
him
it
was
no
luck
to
hold
out
the
dice
most
of
the
time
when
we
reached
new
orleans
the
detectives
were
hunting
him
high
and
low
but
they
thought
he
had
gone
out
on
one
of
the
trains
and
i
never
made
them
any
the
wiser
when
i
inquired
if
i
had
seen
him
i
replied
oh
such
fellows
would
get
on
a
boat
where
i
was
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
never
seen
him
but
i
think
he
went
west
as
when
he
was
under
the
influence
of
liquor
he
talked
a
great
deal
of
that
part
of
the
country
he
one
of
us
tripp
and
i
at
one
time
played
an
early
train
from
chicago
down
to
michigan
city
and
there
we
got
off
to
wait
for
another
train
to
take
us
to
detroit
we
were
in
a
saloon
and
wishing
for
something
to
turn
up
that
we
might
pass
the
time
until
the
next
train
arrived
there
was
an
old
fellow
in
the
saloon
who
was
very
talkative
and
we
learned
from
his
talk
that
he
was
well
posted
about
that
part
of
the
country
i
did
not
think
he
had
any
money
so
i
had
no
idea
of
playing
him
but
thought
i
would
talk
about
the
country
crops
and
such
like
we
had
not
talked
long
until
i
found
he
was
waiting
for
the
same
train
that
we
were
expecting
to
take
i
asked
him
if
he
would
play
euchre
to
pass
the
time
and
he
said
he
would
we
then
sat
down
and
began
a
game
for
the
drinks
once
in
a
while
the
old
fellow
would
say
something
about
poker
hands
so
i
finally
ran
him
up
the
old
chestnut
of
four
queens
and
an
ace
giving
tripp
four
kings
and
taking
nothing
myself
i
came
the
old
spit
racket
and
exposed
my
hand
the
old
fellow
says
i
a
good
poker
hand
how
much
will
you
bet
on
your
hand
i
inquired
he
said
i
will
bet
five
dollars
put
her
up
says
i
he
pulled
out
his
money
and
put
up
tripp
then
said
i
believe
my
hand
is
worth
a
call
i
gave
them
the
old
bush
laugh
and
said
boys
i
believe
you
are
both
bluffing
so
i
will
raise
you
both
then
the
old
one
got
out
his
money
again
and
called
tripp
said
you
fellows
have
got
anything
and
i
will
make
you
lay
down
i
will
raise
it
he
was
right
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
for
he
did
make
me
lay
down
the
old
fellow
said
i
still
on
hand
boys
so
out
came
the
money
again
but
this
time
it
took
all
there
was
in
the
roll
he
put
up
and
called
the
bet
tripp
had
hardly
time
to
show
his
hand
when
the
old
fellow
feeling
so
confident
began
to
pull
her
down
tripp
showed
down
the
old
four
kings
saying
hold
on
old
fellow
not
quite
so
fast
he
put
up
his
last
hundred
dollars
to
see
that
hand
and
he
saw
it
about
this
time
our
train
was
coming
so
we
grabbed
our
grips
and
lit
out
i
saw
the
old
gent
talking
to
the
conductor
on
the
platform
and
then
go
into
the
smoker
we
went
into
the
car
but
in
a
short
time
i
went
over
to
take
a
smoke
i
saw
the
old
fellow
just
across
from
where
i
was
sitting
the
conductor
came
in
and
passed
him
without
getting
any
ticket
or
fare
so
when
he
came
back
he
sat
down
with
a
gentleman
just
in
front
of
me
who
was
the
superintendent
of
the
road
he
asked
the
conductor
why
he
passed
the
old
fellow
oh
says
he
he
is
one
of
us
one
of
us
that
old
seedy
cuss
said
the
superintendent
yes
he
has
been
out
west
running
a
freight
on
a
salary
replied
the
conductor
posing
as
nic
longworth
son
on
one
occasion
while
traveling
from
new
orleans
to
baton
rouge
i
espied
a
gentleman
who
was
a
judge
at
the
latter
place
he
was
a
man
of
aristocratic
bearing
and
somewhat
haughty
in
his
manners
i
started
up
my
wheel
after
supper
and
soon
had
a
fine
game
it
was
not
long
before
i
noticed
a
slick
young
man
that
i
knew
was
from
cincinnati
walking
arm
and
arm
with
the
judge
and
apparently
on
terms
of
utmost
intimacy
with
him
this
slick
young
cincinnatian
had
introduced
himself
as
a
son
of
the
late
nicholas
longworth
who
was
well
known
up
and
down
the
river
he
claimed
that
he
was
traveling
for
his
health
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
he
was
playing
a
dead
card
as
i
did
not
think
the
judge
was
of
much
force
though
he
always
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
money
they
soon
were
playing
euchre
and
began
talking
about
poker
and
presently
the
judge
came
to
me
and
said
devol
will
you
loan
me
i
will
pay
you
when
baton
rouge
is
reached
i
am
a
sure
winner
he
continued
and
looking
at
his
hand
i
saw
the
old
familiar
four
queens
and
an
ace
with
which
i
had
downed
so
many
suckers
i
must
say
i
wanted
to
see
him
get
it
in
the
neck
and
i
was
not
disappointed
i
took
chances
and
loaned
him
and
when
i
saw
longworth
son
putting
it
in
his
pocket
that
was
the
last
time
i
ever
beheld
that
money
the
judge
never
recognized
me
again
this
is
what
an
honest
man
gets
when
in
bad
company
the
good
deacon
i
was
playing
on
the
north
missouri
railroad
just
out
of
kansas
city
having
a
man
named
jeffers
as
a
partner
one
evening
a
fine
looking
solid
appearing
gentleman
came
along
and
appeared
to
take
a
great
interest
in
the
game
which
was
just
for
fun
jeffers
came
up
and
insisted
on
betting
but
i
quickly
replied
that
i
did
not
care
to
bet
as
i
was
only
showing
my
friend
the
game
so
as
to
guard
him
against
ever
betting
on
it
in
case
he
ever
saw
it
being
played
jeffers
was
so
persistent
that
i
finally
yielded
at
the
same
time
telling
him
that
the
odds
were
so
much
in
my
favor
that
i
would
not
mind
venturing
why
i
can
pick
up
the
right
card
every
time
he
said
at
last
turning
to
my
friend
i
observed
i
have
a
great
mind
to
let
the
fool
lose
his
money
accordingly
i
remarked
i
go
you
that
you
ca
and
at
once
pulled
out
a
big
roll
which
made
the
solid
man
look
bad
the
play
was
made
and
i
won
which
greatly
amused
my
friend
who
was
anxious
for
my
success
as
the
fellow
had
given
me
the
dare
in
a
blustering
sort
of
way
jeffers
made
no
kick
but
picking
up
the
cards
put
a
spot
on
one
of
them
which
he
showed
my
friend
threw
the
cards
on
the
table
and
said
throw
again
my
friend
gave
me
a
hunch
as
he
did
not
wish
to
see
me
worsted
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
however
when
jeffers
pulled
out
played
it
and
won
then
turning
to
my
friend
he
said
take
play
it
for
me
and
pay
you
for
your
trouble
he
did
so
and
won
i
laughed
and
let
the
old
fellow
know
that
i
did
think
he
had
pluck
enough
to
bet
at
any
game
oh
i
would
bet
if
the
money
i
have
was
my
own
then
jeffers
began
to
work
him
telling
him
that
i
was
rich
and
that
they
might
as
well
have
some
of
my
money
as
not
just
try
it
once
said
the
insinuating
jeffers
put
the
money
in
my
hand
and
when
you
win
i
will
hand
it
back
to
you
jeffers
next
offered
to
bet
again
but
i
said
i
would
bet
with
him
but
i
will
with
my
friend
here
as
his
eyes
are
not
so
keen
as
yours
at
last
the
old
man
pulled
out
and
i
tried
to
make
him
put
up
more
but
he
stuck
to
the
when
i
said
i
will
have
to
raise
you
as
i
had
noticed
that
he
had
in
the
roll
he
wanted
to
take
down
his
money
but
i
could
see
it
so
jeffers
told
him
if
he
did
put
up
the
that
he
would
lose
what
he
had
put
up
so
at
last
he
laid
it
up
turned
the
card
and
lost
then
i
looked
for
fun
at
this
moment
the
porter
of
the
sleeper
came
in
and
told
me
that
my
wife
wanted
to
see
me
for
a
moment
excusing
myself
i
started
back
with
my
friend
at
my
heels
but
the
porter
refused
him
admission
to
the
sleeper
i
was
ready
to
get
off
at
the
first
station
but
waited
until
the
train
was
under
way
when
i
dropped
off
only
to
find
that
some
one
else
had
done
the
same
thing
and
was
rolling
over
in
the
sand
i
went
to
see
who
it
was
and
there
was
my
friend
considerably
bruised
and
banged
up
do
you
live
here
i
asked
oh
no
he
replied
but
i
want
my
money
back
well
if
that
is
what
you
got
off
for
you
are
a
bigger
fool
than
i
took
you
to
be
for
not
one
cent
will
you
ever
get
of
that
money
he
hung
to
me
nearly
all
night
until
i
was
compelled
to
tell
my
story
to
a
man
at
the
station
and
get
him
to
hitch
up
a
horse
for
me
and
leave
it
standing
behind
a
small
hill
and
have
another
horse
ready
in
his
barn
so
that
he
could
follow
me
and
show
me
the
road
a
bran
new
bill
consummated
this
arrangement
i
fooled
around
with
the
sucker
for
some
time
then
running
i
mounted
the
horse
and
galloped
off
the
game
worked
to
perfection
the
old
fellow
bawled
out
that
i
had
stolen
a
horse
and
the
owner
mounted
the
other
horse
and
pushed
hard
after
me
when
i
had
gone
about
four
miles
i
slackened
up
and
let
him
overtake
me
and
we
reached
another
train
going
to
kansas
city
fifteen
minutes
before
starting
time
the
owner
of
the
horses
returned
to
town
and
told
the
story
that
he
had
fired
at
me
and
that
i
was
wounded
and
bleeding
and
he
feared
would
die
jeffers
came
up
to
kansas
city
the
next
day
and
was
astonished
to
see
me
alive
several
days
after
i
came
face
to
face
on
the
street
with
my
old
friend
who
at
once
had
me
arrested
for
stealing
from
him
i
went
to
the
chief
office
and
explained
that
i
had
neither
stolen
a
horse
nor
robbed
any
body
that
i
had
won
the
money
at
cards
the
old
fellow
wanted
the
money
back
and
declared
that
he
was
a
deacon
in
a
church
jeffers
the
capper
came
in
when
he
heard
that
i
was
arrested
and
told
the
chief
that
he
had
given
the
deacon
ten
dollars
to
win
the
bet
for
him
so
the
chief
in
face
of
this
evidence
had
nothing
to
do
but
release
me
the
next
day
a
prominent
member
of
the
church
was
scouring
kansas
city
for
the
good
deacon
thinking
he
had
absconded
with
the
church
funds
i
never
gave
up
a
cent
though
when
they
have
passed
around
the
hat
i
have
always
chipped
in
and
during
the
last
forty
years
have
probably
contributed
to
churches
ten
times
as
much
as
the
deacon
lost
and
never
regretted
it
either
narrow
escapes
there
are
a
great
many
men
who
whenever
they
lose
any
money
begin
to
kick
and
oftentimes
they
will
resort
to
very
desperate
means
to
recover
back
the
money
which
they
have
honestly
lost
coming
out
of
canton
one
night
on
the
jackson
railroad
i
won
some
money
in
the
and
then
retired
to
the
sleeper
and
was
reading
a
paper
when
the
conductor
coming
along
said
are
you
the
gentleman
who
won
some
money
a
short
time
ago
in
the
smoker
i
am
sir
well
you
want
to
be
on
the
lookout
as
the
parties
are
threatening
to
have
it
back
or
there
will
be
blood
just
then
the
three
entered
the
car
and
as
i
raised
up
my
eyes
the
foremost
one
a
pittsburger
said
we
are
looking
for
you
well
you
have
found
me
at
home
what
is
your
business
we
want
our
money
back
and
if
we
do
get
it
you
will
never
get
off
this
train
alive
that
was
enough
for
me
and
in
a
second
i
had
my
big
gun
leveled
at
the
one
nearest
me
and
i
said
if
you
move
an
inch
i
cook
your
goose
for
you
sure
he
fell
back
in
good
order
and
in
the
next
second
the
name
behind
him
made
a
break
at
me
when
i
caught
him
with
my
big
pistol
splitting
his
head
open
and
next
i
made
a
lunge
for
the
third
man
cutting
him
over
the
forehead
so
that
he
fell
through
a
rack
of
glass
and
when
he
raised
up
i
struck
him
with
my
head
the
conductor
and
brakeman
interfered
and
took
the
ruffians
out
there
was
a
quart
of
blood
on
the
floor
and
at
the
first
station
they
sent
out
and
procured
i
paid
the
porter
to
sponge
up
the
blood
and
get
the
glass
reset
a
man
once
pulled
out
his
gun
on
me
at
milan
whom
i
had
beaten
out
of
i
let
on
as
though
i
would
return
it
until
he
turned
his
head
away
when
i
hit
him
a
stinging
blow
on
the
ear
that
doubled
him
up
like
a
i
took
his
pistol
and
was
arrested
for
winning
his
money
and
assaulting
him
but
when
the
judge
heard
the
testimony
he
fined
us
both
and
costs
amounting
to
he
gave
the
fellow
a
lecture
for
drawing
a
pistol
and
i
paid
my
fine
and
was
off
another
time
in
new
orleans
i
was
crossing
the
levee
late
one
night
with
a
valise
full
of
money
when
two
men
came
from
behind
a
cotton
bale
and
started
toward
me
i
pulled
out
my
big
pistol
and
told
them
an
inch
further
and
i
would
shoot
they
weakened
and
after
they
started
i
turned
her
loose
to
enjoy
the
sport
of
seeing
them
run
a
crazy
man
one
afternoon
i
started
from
kansas
city
on
the
missouri
pacific
railroad
and
while
seated
waiting
for
the
train
to
start
i
fell
asleep
we
had
not
gone
more
than
ten
miles
when
a
crazy
man
armed
with
a
colt
navy
entered
the
car
the
passengers
all
fled
leaving
me
alone
up
rushed
the
lunatic
and
cracked
me
over
the
head
a
couple
of
times
with
so
much
force
that
i
speedily
awoke
and
saw
this
man
standing
over
me
saying
if
you
move
i
will
kill
you
i
did
move
only
said
you
have
made
a
mistake
at
which
he
backed
out
of
the
car
thereupon
the
passengers
all
rushed
in
with
revolvers
in
hand
wanting
to
know
where
that
lunatic
was
though
i
have
seen
many
crazy
people
since
i
can
never
forget
the
terrible
glare
of
those
eyes
and
can
compare
them
to
nothing
but
the
fiery
glare
of
a
cat
eyes
in
the
dark
i
returned
to
kansas
city
and
laid
up
for
some
time
as
the
physicians
feared
that
erysipelas
would
set
in
it
was
not
more
than
a
week
after
this
that
the
lunatic
was
seen
on
a
hurling
bricks
down
on
the
he
was
at
last
lassoed
with
a
rope
and
taken
to
the
he
butted
his
brains
out
against
the
iron
bars
of
his
cell
and
killed
himself
eight
hundred
dollars
against
a
pistol
i
was
playing
monte
one
night
on
the
when
a
fellow
stepped
up
to
the
table
and
bet
me
i
knew
it
was
all
the
money
he
had
for
he
tried
to
make
it
by
putting
up
his
watch
but
in
those
days
i
would
not
turn
for
a
watch
unless
it
was
a
juergunsen
or
very
fine
make
when
he
had
lost
his
money
and
spent
a
few
moments
studying
he
whipped
out
a
colt
navy
and
said
see
here
friend
that
is
all
the
money
i
have
got
and
i
am
going
to
die
right
here
but
i
will
have
it
back
i
coolly
said
did
you
think
i
was
going
to
keep
the
money
he
replied
i
knew
very
well
you
would
not
keep
it
if
you
had
i
would
have
filled
you
full
of
lead
i
am
from
texas
sir
and
the
man
straightened
himself
up
pulling
out
a
roll
of
money
i
said
i
want
to
whisper
to
you
he
put
his
head
down
and
i
said
that
i
did
want
to
give
up
the
money
before
all
these
people
that
then
they
would
want
their
money
back
but
you
offer
to
bet
me
again
and
i
will
bet
the
against
your
pistol
that
pleased
him
all
right
he
said
and
the
and
pistol
went
up
in
my
partner
hands
over
went
the
wrong
card
i
grabbed
the
pistol
and
told
my
partner
to
give
me
the
stake
money
pulling
the
gun
on
him
now
i
said
you
have
acted
the
wet
dog
about
this
and
i
will
not
give
you
a
cent
of
your
money
and
if
you
cut
any
more
capers
i
break
your
nose
i
presented
the
pistol
to
the
mate
of
the
boat
who
kept
it
for
a
number
of
years
and
said
that
it
was
the
best
he
had
ever
owned
another
time
on
the
same
boat
i
was
playing
euchre
with
a
californian
when
we
got
to
betting
on
poker
hands
he
lost
and
his
watch
then
told
the
clerk
that
he
was
going
to
his
for
his
pistol
and
going
to
kill
that
gambler
on
sight
the
clerk
soon
gave
me
a
hint
and
i
got
out
old
betsy
jane
and
pretty
soon
he
came
along
holding
his
pistol
under
his
coat
and
just
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
cabin
door
i
pulled
down
on
him
saying
i
have
got
you
my
boy
and
if
you
make
one
move
i
turn
her
loose
he
saw
i
had
the
drop
on
him
threw
up
both
hands
and
taking
his
pistol
away
i
threw
it
into
the
river
it
was
cold
there
are
many
occasions
when
a
shrewd
man
can
get
in
his
work
on
gamblers
it
matters
not
how
smart
they
are
provided
his
conduct
is
not
suspicious
and
his
ambition
so
vaulting
that
when
it
leaps
it
is
not
lost
upon
the
other
side
i
shall
never
forget
the
trip
i
made
down
the
river
from
louisville
in
the
good
old
days
when
we
reached
the
mouth
of
the
cumberland
river
anderson
waddell
who
is
now
one
of
louisville
wealthiest
citizens
and
william
cheatham
came
on
board
bound
for
the
new
orleans
races
charles
burns
and
edward
ryan
better
known
to
the
sporting
fraternity
as
dad
ryan
were
along
with
me
both
waddell
and
cheatham
were
gentlemen
of
good
repute
in
nashville
and
it
was
not
long
before
they
proposed
a
game
of
poker
burns
and
ryan
both
sat
in
the
game
and
at
the
time
they
were
unknown
to
the
gentlemen
the
wine
flowed
freely
and
everybody
felt
very
happy
and
i
resolved
it
was
about
time
for
me
to
go
to
the
bar
and
procure
some
cards
similar
to
those
they
were
playing
with
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
run
up
three
good
hands
and
sitting
down
by
ryan
i
laid
the
cold
deck
in
ryan
lap
it
was
not
long
before
the
cold
deck
came
up
and
then
the
boys
began
to
bet
lively
each
getting
in
a
few
hundred
then
waddell
commenced
to
smell
a
rat
and
turning
to
cheatham
said
hold
on
bill
do
go
in
any
deeper
as
i
think
this
deck
of
cards
does
not
feel
as
warm
as
it
did
a
few
minutes
ago
oh
no
responded
bill
i
hardly
believe
there
is
anything
wrong
at
last
they
came
to
a
call
then
they
knew
that
they
had
got
the
worst
of
it
yet
they
never
uttered
a
word
or
make
a
kick
and
when
we
reached
new
orleans
they
confessed
that
the
boys
had
made
suckers
of
them
poor
bill
is
now
dead
and
waddell
who
is
still
living
would
if
asked
laugh
and
say
that
he
had
long
ago
learned
not
to
hunt
up
poker
games
on
steamboats
how
i
was
beat
sam
houstin
and
harry
monell
were
in
business
with
me
working
the
missouri
pacific
and
we
were
very
successful
making
a
great
deal
of
money
during
the
summer
we
played
the
bank
and
in
the
winter
operated
on
the
river
and
southern
roads
immediately
after
the
big
fire
we
resolved
to
go
to
chicago
but
at
the
last
minute
houstin
was
unable
to
go
but
i
told
him
he
should
be
in
with
the
play
and
share
the
profits
as
if
he
was
along
monell
and
i
started
and
made
a
few
hundred
dollars
and
when
houstin
joined
us
he
received
his
share
of
the
spoils
we
were
all
stopping
at
the
tremont
house
on
lake
street
we
made
a
little
money
and
one
sunday
morning
i
arose
early
and
resolved
to
go
out
on
the
road
about
twenty
miles
while
waiting
for
breakfast
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
gentleman
from
texas
who
had
just
sold
some
cattle
that
he
had
brought
with
him
we
had
a
cocktail
together
and
i
sent
the
porter
to
awaken
my
partners
whom
i
duly
introduced
to
the
stranger
letting
them
know
that
he
had
money
and
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
on
him
until
monday
morning
when
i
returned
at
night
i
found
that
my
partners
had
beat
the
texan
and
he
had
houstin
locked
up
in
jail
i
carried
him
down
a
good
supper
from
a
restaurant
and
then
hunted
up
the
texan
who
told
me
that
he
had
started
in
betting
and
at
first
won
and
then
lost
and
that
his
only
object
in
arresting
houstin
was
to
scare
him
so
as
to
get
his
money
back
the
other
man
he
could
not
find
he
said
he
had
gambled
when
in
texas
but
these
fellows
were
too
smart
for
him
and
that
he
could
not
afford
to
lose
that
money
when
the
case
was
called
for
trial
the
judge
dismissed
it
on
the
ground
that
they
were
all
gamblers
nothing
was
said
about
the
settlement
of
the
game
for
a
couple
of
days
when
one
morning
they
both
arose
paid
their
bills
and
skipped
and
i
never
received
a
cent
of
that
money
i
have
since
learned
that
monell
is
doing
time
at
sing
sing
along
with
paper
collar
joe
while
houstin
is
an
old
man
trying
to
lead
a
square
life
i
understand
down
in
florida
the
late
sherman
thurston
once
said
to
me
george
those
fellows
are
rotten
apples
but
i
did
not
heed
his
advice
and
let
them
alone
settled
our
hash
jew
mose
and
myself
were
once
traveling
on
the
missouri
railroad
having
headquarters
at
cheyenne
and
making
a
good
deal
of
money
when
one
evening
i
picked
up
a
man
on
the
sleeper
and
beat
him
out
of
that
game
settled
our
hash
for
he
proved
to
be
one
of
the
directors
of
the
road
and
as
soon
as
he
reached
omaha
he
had
a
lot
of
handbills
printed
and
hung
up
in
the
cars
not
only
prohibiting
gambling
but
that
conductors
permitting
the
game
on
their
cars
would
be
at
once
discharged
i
was
then
running
a
game
in
greer
brothers
gold
room
saloon
and
occasionally
slipped
out
and
started
a
game
on
some
of
the
trains
there
were
a
dozen
boys
aboard
one
night
when
mose
opened
out
and
took
in
a
couple
of
them
they
began
to
drink
heavily
and
then
resolved
to
make
the
gambler
disgorge
i
expected
fun
so
i
told
mose
to
get
off
and
jump
on
the
engine
at
the
first
station
he
was
none
too
quick
for
the
boys
went
through
the
train
and
never
found
him
but
they
never
said
a
word
to
me
as
they
supposed
i
was
a
sucker
like
themselves
for
at
the
time
i
was
very
roughly
dressed
these
boys
while
very
blustering
when
on
the
trains
were
peaceable
enough
when
they
entered
a
for
the
gamblers
would
stand
no
foolishness
with
them
and
were
always
prepared
to
draw
at
a
second
warning
i
raised
the
limit
i
recollect
playing
in
a
game
of
poker
at
one
time
on
the
steamer
it
was
a
game
and
the
party
were
all
friends
of
each
other
we
were
playing
on
the
square
with
a
straight
deck
of
cards
and
for
a
small
limit
i
could
enjoy
myself
in
such
a
game
for
a
limited
time
then
the
old
desire
to
play
my
tricks
would
come
over
me
and
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
i
did
not
want
to
beat
my
friends
only
on
the
square
but
i
did
want
to
have
some
fun
so
i
excused
myself
for
a
few
moments
and
left
the
table
on
my
return
i
sat
in
again
and
the
game
went
on
as
before
we
had
been
playing
a
short
time
when
one
of
the
boys
picked
up
his
hand
got
a
glimpse
of
it
and
then
threw
it
down
as
quick
as
lightning
saying
what
the
limit
all
the
others
looked
at
their
hands
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
remember
what
limit
we
had
been
playing
one
thought
it
was
but
was
willing
to
raise
it
to
if
the
others
would
agree
i
remarked
that
the
limit
had
been
but
but
i
never
kicked
if
anybody
wanted
to
raise
her
so
they
all
consented
to
raise
it
to
the
one
next
to
the
age
put
up
the
limit
the
next
one
saw
that
and
went
him
twenty
better
the
next
one
did
the
same
i
said
boys
you
are
bluffing
so
i
will
just
call
the
age
then
raised
her
the
limit
and
it
went
around
until
most
of
the
boys
had
put
up
all
their
money
then
it
came
to
a
draw
some
took
one
card
some
stood
pat
and
i
took
three
then
the
betting
was
resumed
at
a
lively
rate
those
that
had
put
up
all
their
money
borrowed
from
friends
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
did
see
four
men
have
so
much
confidence
in
their
hands
i
kept
calling
and
finally
it
was
a
call
all
around
but
no
one
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
show
down
i
threw
down
three
tens
when
they
all
said
i
got
you
beat
i
said
gentlemen
it
a
call
all
around
why
do
you
show
down
they
all
came
down
about
the
same
time
and
you
should
have
been
there
for
all
the
passengers
on
the
boat
were
looking
on
they
saw
each
other
hands
and
i
be
gol
darned
if
every
one
of
them
did
have
fours
and
they
were
all
aces
at
that
all
four
of
them
spoke
up
in
the
same
breath
who
dealt
the
cards
i
replied
i
did
we
sent
for
the
first
and
second
clerks
to
bring
a
quire
of
paper
and
figure
out
who
won
the
money
and
how
much
each
one
was
entitled
to
after
the
problem
was
solved
we
resumed
the
play
but
first
the
boys
made
me
swear
i
did
not
have
any
more
cold
decks
on
my
persons
with
sixteen
aces
in
them
as
i
had
raised
the
limit
to
i
took
the
oath
and
we
again
settled
down
to
a
square
game
got
off
between
stations
a
man
by
the
name
of
charlie
adams
tripp
and
myself
started
out
from
chicago
on
the
michigan
central
railroad
one
day
to
turn
a
few
honest
dollars
we
took
separate
cars
and
began
looking
for
a
game
i
was
in
the
ladies
car
and
thought
i
saw
plenty
of
material
but
the
most
of
it
was
handicapped
with
female
riders
there
was
one
old
gentleman
sitting
alone
so
i
took
a
seat
beside
him
and
began
to
feel
his
pulse
he
had
sold
a
pair
of
horses
for
and
an
interest
in
a
patent
for
i
did
not
want
to
play
him
in
that
car
for
i
wanted
some
of
the
other
a
little
later
on
so
i
invited
him
to
join
me
in
a
smoke
he
declined
and
told
me
that
he
never
smoked
a
cigar
chewed
tobacco
or
drank
a
drop
of
liquor
in
his
life
then
i
knew
he
would
be
a
darling
sucker
so
i
invited
him
to
go
over
in
the
until
i
could
have
a
little
smoke
myself
he
consented
and
we
went
over
we
took
a
seat
just
behind
a
green
looking
countryman
who
was
smoking
a
cob
pipe
and
it
was
not
long
until
he
turned
round
and
asked
us
the
name
of
a
station
we
had
just
passed
we
did
not
know
the
name
so
he
said
i
do
wonder
you
ca
tell
the
names
for
i
never
saw
so
many
towns
strung
a
railroad
why
out
where
i
live
we
do
have
a
town
only
about
once
in
fifty
miles
i
asked
him
where
he
lived
he
replied
when
i
to
hum
i
lives
on
a
ranch
in
colorado
but
i
been
to
chicago
sellin
of
my
steers
and
them
thar
fellows
came
nigh
gettin
the
best
of
me
with
some
of
their
games
but
they
gave
me
some
of
their
tickets
and
when
i
get
home
i
make
the
boys
think
i
did
take
my
critters
to
chicago
for
nothing
i
guess
as
how
they
would
have
got
more
of
my
money
but
i
left
it
up
at
the
tavern
with
the
feller
that
had
his
hair
all
glued
down
to
his
forehead
as
if
he
thought
it
would
fall
off
so
when
they
got
all
i
had
with
me
they
thought
i
was
broke
and
let
me
go
the
old
gent
asked
him
to
show
us
how
they
beat
him
with
the
tickets
he
said
i
not
larnt
it
yet
but
i
will
try
and
show
you
so
he
got
out
his
three
tickets
and
began
to
throw
them
on
the
seat
explaining
that
we
must
guess
the
ticket
with
the
little
boy
on
it
we
guessed
sometimes
right
and
sometimes
wrong
i
bent
up
the
corner
of
the
little
boy
ticket
and
told
the
old
gent
not
to
turn
that
card
until
we
got
a
bet
out
of
the
fool
so
we
would
miss
it
every
time
after
that
finally
i
offered
to
bet
him
that
i
could
turn
up
the
boy
ticket
the
first
turn
he
said
no
i
wo
bet
on
her
yet
for
i
ca
play
her
good
then
i
offered
to
bet
him
five
to
two
so
he
got
out
his
big
roll
saying
this
is
the
money
i
left
up
to
the
tavern
so
i
just
try
you
once
i
put
up
my
and
he
put
up
i
turned
the
ticket
with
the
corner
bent
and
won
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
then
said
to
the
old
gent
who
was
holding
the
stakes
give
him
the
money
for
gol
darned
if
he
did
get
her
fair
then
i
offered
to
bet
him
but
he
said
you
got
an
eye
like
an
indian
and
i
do
want
to
play
with
you
any
more
but
i
will
play
with
your
pap
pointing
to
the
old
gent
the
old
fellow
said
i
am
a
church
member
and
never
bet
but
i
expect
some
one
will
win
all
that
fellow
money
before
he
gets
home
certainly
said
i
and
we
may
as
well
have
it
as
any
one
else
the
old
gent
got
out
his
money
and
wanted
to
bet
but
the
fellow
would
not
bet
less
than
i
then
offered
to
put
up
the
balance
but
the
fellow
would
not
have
it
saying
your
eyes
are
too
good
then
the
old
gent
put
up
the
money
in
my
hands
and
turned
the
card
but
it
was
not
the
winner
for
somehow
in
mixing
them
the
corner
of
the
boy
card
had
got
straightened
out
and
the
corner
of
another
was
turned
up
i
put
a
mark
on
the
boy
card
with
my
pencil
while
the
fellow
was
putting
away
his
money
and
then
told
him
as
he
was
a
little
winner
he
should
let
me
bet
once
more
he
said
all
right
so
i
put
up
turned
the
marked
card
and
won
the
old
church
member
could
not
stand
it
to
see
me
win
all
that
fool
money
so
he
put
up
more
in
order
to
get
even
the
fellow
told
him
he
would
make
it
and
as
that
would
get
him
out
ahead
up
she
went
and
he
turned
the
marked
card
but
as
was
the
case
with
the
crocked
corner
the
little
mark
was
on
another
card
the
old
gent
dropped
back
in
his
seat
with
a
groan
and
just
then
a
gentleman
who
had
been
sitting
across
the
aisle
got
up
and
said
you
fellows
have
been
trying
to
rob
this
boy
out
of
his
money
i
have
been
watching
you
and
will
report
you
to
the
officers
at
the
next
station
the
old
gent
got
up
and
started
back
to
his
car
saying
to
me
in
a
whisper
you
had
better
get
out
of
this
or
you
may
get
into
trouble
i
replied
i
think
so
myself
so
i
got
up
and
started
back
with
him
but
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
that
i
got
lost
from
him
when
the
train
got
up
to
the
next
station
there
were
three
less
passengers
on
board
than
when
that
fellow
said
i
will
report
you
to
the
officers
a
good
night
work
there
had
been
quite
a
number
of
communications
received
by
the
officers
of
the
michigan
southern
complaining
about
the
gamblers
beating
the
passengers
on
that
road
consequently
orders
were
issued
to
the
conductors
not
to
allow
any
gambling
on
their
trains
they
did
try
to
prevent
it
but
the
boys
were
too
smart
for
them
and
got
away
with
many
a
good
dollar
while
the
conductor
was
collecting
fare
or
out
on
the
platform
at
a
station
the
result
was
the
complaints
continued
to
go
to
the
officers
of
the
road
and
some
of
them
went
so
far
as
to
claim
that
the
conductors
were
in
with
the
gamblers
the
poor
conductors
insisted
that
they
could
not
watch
the
rascals
and
their
trains
at
one
and
the
same
time
but
the
superintendent
thought
they
could
and
threatened
to
discharge
any
one
who
was
complained
of
again
he
found
out
one
day
that
he
conductors
were
right
and
he
was
wrong
i
will
tell
you
how
he
was
convinced
tripp
adams
and
myself
got
on
a
train
going
out
of
chicago
on
the
michigan
southern
one
evening
and
took
seats
in
different
parts
of
the
car
in
a
few
moments
after
the
train
started
the
conductor
and
a
fine
looking
old
gentleman
came
into
the
car
where
we
were
seated
and
something
told
me
that
he
was
one
of
the
officers
i
saw
them
talking
together
a
short
distance
from
where
i
was
sitting
alongside
of
a
big
fat
man
the
conductor
was
evidently
pointing
us
out
for
i
could
see
by
his
actions
that
they
had
us
spotted
the
other
boys
knew
what
was
in
the
wind
for
we
had
all
been
there
before
and
understood
our
business
the
conductor
left
the
car
but
the
old
gentleman
took
a
seat
facing
us
so
we
began
to
think
the
jig
was
up
for
that
trip
for
there
was
a
pair
of
eyes
constantly
upon
us
but
as
we
did
not
make
a
move
the
old
fellow
got
a
little
careless
took
out
a
package
of
papers
and
began
to
look
over
them
when
i
saw
he
was
very
much
interested
in
the
papers
and
began
to
use
his
pencil
i
gave
tripp
the
wink
and
he
slipped
over
to
my
seat
we
went
through
the
old
business
about
the
same
as
if
the
old
pair
of
eyes
was
not
in
the
same
car
only
we
talked
low
and
while
the
car
was
in
motion
no
one
could
hear
what
was
going
on
just
before
we
reached
a
station
tripp
beat
the
big
fat
man
out
of
and
he
had
beaten
me
out
of
before
we
got
him
to
put
up
i
gave
him
the
office
to
get
off
at
the
station
so
when
the
cars
stopped
he
was
on
the
platform
there
was
a
jew
sitting
just
behind
us
who
had
been
watching
the
game
and
he
saw
tripp
out
on
the
platform
so
he
laughed
and
said
you
see
that
fellow
he
gets
off
when
he
wins
your
moneys
the
old
superintendent
jumped
up
put
away
his
papers
and
said
what
this
some
one
been
in
car
the
jew
told
him
that
the
fellow
with
the
slouch
hat
had
won
from
the
big
fat
man
and
from
me
i
told
my
fat
friend
it
was
no
one
business
if
we
lost
our
money
so
when
the
old
gent
who
had
been
watching
his
papers
just
long
enough
for
us
to
get
our
work
in
came
up
to
us
and
asked
if
we
had
lost
our
money
my
fat
friend
said
it
none
of
your
business
the
money
did
not
belong
to
you
just
then
the
conductor
came
in
so
the
superintendent
said
to
him
those
d
d
villains
have
played
their
games
right
under
my
very
nose
beat
these
d
d
fools
out
of
over
and
got
off
now
if
any
one
comes
into
my
office
and
tells
me
our
conductors
are
in
with
the
d
d
gamblers
i
will
take
a
club
and
knock
his
d
d
brains
out
you
attend
to
the
train
hereafter
and
let
the
d
d
suckers
take
care
of
themselves
the
conductor
said
all
right
sir
the
old
fellow
was
so
hot
that
he
went
out
into
another
car
to
cool
off
my
fat
friend
bid
me
soon
after
and
asked
me
to
call
on
him
should
i
ever
stop
off
at
his
place
i
promised
to
do
so
and
we
separated
warm
friends
when
i
told
tripp
what
the
old
superintendent
said
he
replied
george
it
the
best
work
we
ever
did
at
another
time
we
were
playing
a
train
or
at
least
we
had
paid
our
passage
for
the
purpose
of
turning
a
few
dollars
but
i
noticed
the
conductor
was
watching
us
very
closely
and
i
knew
that
about
the
time
we
had
our
man
ready
he
would
drop
down
on
us
and
tell
the
sucker
that
we
were
gamblers
and
then
we
would
have
all
our
trouble
for
nothing
so
i
told
my
partners
to
work
up
the
business
and
when
i
saw
everything
was
i
would
go
to
the
conductor
and
entertain
him
until
the
job
was
finished
well
the
boys
had
a
fellow
all
ready
to
blow
himself
when
i
saw
the
knight
of
the
punch
bearing
down
upon
them
i
jumped
up
and
met
him
but
he
was
in
a
hurry
and
did
not
want
to
stop
so
i
caught
him
and
held
on
until
all
was
over
he
kicked
like
a
government
mule
but
it
was
too
late
so
he
said
i
would
not
catch
him
again
i
gave
him
a
cigar
and
told
him
i
would
try
a
new
scheme
next
time
as
a
burnt
child
dreaded
the
fire
he
laughed
and
so
did
i
and
that
ended
it
he
not
that
old
about
forty
years
ago
i
was
a
pioneer
in
the
great
northwest
or
lake
and
central
states
and
was
pretty
largely
interested
in
the
different
branches
of
business
that
paid
a
large
profit
on
the
amount
of
capital
invested
i
was
running
keno
in
paul
playing
poker
with
the
indians
and
running
the
risk
of
losing
my
scalp
in
minnesota
building
frame
shanties
out
of
green
lumber
for
lodgers
at
a
dollar
a
head
at
winona
and
running
a
restaurant
saloon
billiard
and
keno
room
at
dubuque
iowa
i
was
kept
pretty
busy
looking
after
and
attending
to
my
different
branches
of
business
and
i
divided
my
time
between
them
at
one
time
while
i
was
in
dubuque
looking
after
my
restaurant
saloon
billiard
and
keno
rooms
i
met
a
robust
young
man
who
had
come
out
west
seeking
his
fortune
in
the
show
business
he
came
into
my
place
and
introduced
himself
as
he
was
a
total
stranger
in
those
parts
i
took
quite
a
liking
to
the
young
man
and
i
told
him
to
make
my
place
his
home
while
he
remained
in
our
town
he
thanked
me
for
my
kindness
for
in
those
days
i
was
kind
and
said
he
would
be
pleased
if
i
would
assist
him
in
advertising
his
show
they
did
not
have
such
large
handsome
bills
to
draw
the
crowds
to
the
i
mean
in
those
days
as
they
have
now
but
this
young
showman
knew
a
thing
or
two
so
he
adopted
the
plan
that
is
largely
practiced
by
our
minstrel
troupes
at
this
late
day
he
got
some
of
us
chaps
to
show
him
the
town
i
do
mean
like
it
is
done
in
these
days
he
wanted
us
to
walk
around
all
the
nice
streets
so
he
could
see
the
people
and
so
the
girls
could
see
him
we
did
it
and
the
result
was
all
the
girls
in
that
place
were
at
the
show
the
first
night
i
got
all
the
boys
to
go
over
and
give
the
young
fellow
a
lift
and
when
he
left
the
town
he
was
much
better
fixed
financially
than
when
he
landed
all
the
girls
and
some
of
the
boys
were
sorry
to
see
him
leave
he
thanked
me
for
the
favors
more
especially
for
the
one
of
showing
him
the
town
and
he
has
not
forgotten
them
to
this
day
for
we
often
speak
of
the
old
times
out
west
but
he
insists
that
it
is
not
near
forty
years
ago
but
i
know
why
he
do
want
me
to
give
dates
he
need
not
fear
for
i
will
not
tell
who
the
good
looking
boy
was
that
i
met
in
dubuque
about
forty
years
ago
and
no
one
would
ever
guess
for
at
that
time
he
was
not
running
a
grand
opera
house
and
by
joe
bijou
i
do
believe
he
ever
expected
to
canada
bill
canada
bill
was
a
character
one
might
travel
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
and
never
find
his
match
or
run
across
his
equal
imagine
a
sort
of
man
with
mild
blue
eyes
and
a
mouth
nearly
from
ear
to
ear
who
walked
with
a
shuffling
sort
of
a
gait
and
who
when
his
countenance
was
in
repose
resembled
an
idiot
for
hours
he
would
sit
in
his
chair
twisting
his
hair
in
little
ringlets
then
i
used
to
say
bill
is
studying
up
some
new
devilment
his
clothes
were
always
several
sizes
too
large
and
his
face
was
as
smooth
as
a
woman
and
never
had
a
particle
of
hair
on
it
canada
was
a
slick
one
he
had
a
squeaking
boyish
voice
and
awkward
gawky
manners
and
a
way
of
asking
fool
questions
and
putting
on
a
good
natured
sort
of
a
grin
that
led
everybody
to
believe
that
he
was
the
rankest
kind
of
a
sucker
the
greenest
sort
of
a
country
jake
woe
to
the
man
who
picked
him
up
though
canada
was
under
all
his
hypocritical
appearance
a
regular
card
shark
and
could
turn
monte
with
the
best
of
them
he
was
my
partner
for
a
number
of
years
and
many
are
the
suckers
we
roped
in
and
many
the
huge
roll
of
bills
we
corralled
he
was
an
arrant
coward
though
and
would
not
fight
a
woman
if
she
said
boo
his
right
name
was
jones
when
tom
brown
and
holly
chappell
traveled
with
me
the
four
of
us
made
a
quartette
that
could
give
most
any
crowd
any
sort
of
monte
they
wanted
brown
got
for
his
share
of
the
profit
and
chappell
went
north
with
his
portion
and
is
as
poor
as
myself
bill
never
weighed
over
pounds
and
was
always
complaining
of
pains
in
his
head
i
always
found
him
honest
to
a
fault
and
when
the
poor
fellow
died
i
felt
that
i
had
lost
one
of
my
truest
friends
the
natchez
and
the
lee
when
the
great
steamboat
race
came
off
between
the
and
the
the
excitement
all
along
the
mississippi
river
and
at
louis
new
orleans
and
all
the
river
towns
was
at
fever
heat
betting
ran
high
a
great
deal
of
money
changed
hands
and
very
little
else
was
talked
about
for
a
long
time
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
boats
were
pretty
evenly
matched
but
thought
that
the
ought
to
beat
in
a
straight
run
i
knew
the
could
make
two
landings
to
the
one
the
latter
boat
being
somewhat
and
difficult
to
handle
however
i
put
my
money
on
her
and
believe
she
would
have
won
had
not
captain
canon
and
captain
leathers
captain
canon
took
off
every
extra
pound
of
freight
including
anchors
chains
beds
and
bedding
even
taking
the
doors
and
shutters
off
the
hinges
while
the
hold
and
decks
he
saved
to
be
filled
with
dry
pine
knots
besides
he
engaged
the
steamer
to
go
up
above
baton
rouge
loaded
down
with
the
choicest
of
fuel
the
was
a
very
fast
boat
and
when
baton
rouge
was
reached
the
never
stopped
her
engines
only
slackened
her
speed
a
little
while
the
lay
alongside
and
dumped
the
fuel
on
to
the
the
had
to
land
and
take
a
in
tow
and
by
this
management
made
a
difference
of
over
three
hours
this
gave
the
a
start
of
perhaps
five
hours
as
when
she
did
land
it
was
for
a
moment
only
the
kept
everything
on
board
and
caught
all
the
winds
while
they
whistled
through
the
on
the
day
of
the
race
the
excitement
was
so
great
in
new
orleans
that
when
the
advertised
to
take
people
up
about
twenty
miles
to
see
the
fun
it
was
not
long
before
she
was
loaded
to
her
gunwales
with
all
the
young
bloods
of
the
crescent
city
a
jollier
set
of
fellows
never
got
together
and
as
money
was
plenty
they
made
the
wine
fly
with
a
whirl
i
hunted
up
old
bill
and
dad
ryan
and
made
up
my
mind
we
would
tackle
the
gentry
and
given
them
something
to
spend
their
money
for
bill
opened
up
and
the
young
sprigs
of
the
aristocracy
began
to
pile
up
the
bills
which
bill
was
not
slow
to
rake
in
there
was
nothing
mean
about
bill
and
he
did
refuse
to
take
gold
watches
and
sparklers
and
after
the
game
closed
some
of
the
fellows
resembled
picked
ducks
they
wanted
to
redeem
their
watches
and
diamonds
so
bill
agreed
to
meet
them
at
a
certain
well
known
saloon
the
next
day
as
all
he
wanted
was
the
stuff
nearly
all
of
them
wished
to
make
me
a
nice
present
and
none
of
them
ever
met
me
afterwards
without
asking
me
up
to
smile
just
as
bill
was
closing
up
an
old
fellow
who
knew
me
well
came
up
and
said
devol
who
is
that
old
fool
trying
to
play
that
game
my
friend
had
been
up
on
the
hurricane
roof
and
had
not
noticed
the
game
going
on
so
i
remarked
to
him
hold
on
i
have
been
watching
him
and
am
going
to
take
him
in
pretty
soon
i
then
gave
bill
the
wink
to
keep
on
and
turning
to
the
old
fellow
i
observed
do
leave
here
as
i
may
want
you
to
hold
stakes
for
me
all
right
was
the
answer
and
then
i
turned
to
bill
and
said
let
me
see
your
cards
so
i
picked
up
the
one
with
the
old
woman
on
it
and
put
a
pencil
mark
on
it
which
i
showed
the
old
man
who
was
a
large
wholesale
grocery
merchant
whom
i
had
known
for
years
and
he
had
seen
me
play
monte
many
a
time
i
asked
the
old
fellow
that
was
turning
the
cards
if
he
would
bet
on
the
game
yes
he
replied
i
bet
you
ca
find
any
card
you
may
mention
after
i
mix
up
then
i
said
hide
the
old
woman
so
he
mixed
them
up
again
and
i
said
i
know
it
hard
to
find
but
i
bet
you
i
can
pick
her
up
the
first
time
he
laid
up
the
money
on
the
table
and
i
continued
this
gentleman
will
hold
the
stakes
all
right
said
bill
and
he
put
the
money
in
the
hand
and
i
turned
the
card
bill
said
all
right
fairly
won
give
him
the
money
and
i
pocketed
the
stuff
then
i
offered
to
bet
him
but
bill
declined
to
bet
with
me
any
more
so
my
friend
the
spoke
up
i
bet
you
i
can
turn
the
card
bill
replied
i
have
just
lost
and
if
i
bet
any
more
it
will
not
be
less
than
so
i
handed
my
friend
the
money
to
put
up
but
bill
would
stand
it
and
spoke
up
i
wo
do
that
if
you
do
play
your
own
money
i
wo
bet
so
i
told
him
to
just
lay
it
up
and
turn
the
card
and
i
would
hand
it
to
him
he
got
out
his
wallet
and
put
up
and
i
loaned
him
to
make
it
up
so
he
turned
the
card
the
old
fellow
could
not
believe
himself
he
stood
still
for
a
few
minutes
looked
at
bill
then
at
me
and
finally
said
devol
lend
me
a
bill
and
i
will
go
home
and
stay
there
until
i
get
some
sense
he
did
what
he
said
he
would
and
i
never
saw
him
for
a
couple
of
months
when
one
day
as
i
was
passing
his
house
he
hailed
me
and
calling
me
in
he
counted
me
out
in
bills
and
said
here
is
what
i
owe
you
now
i
want
to
know
if
you
have
found
any
more
old
fellows
who
do
know
how
to
play
that
game
of
monte
of
course
i
laughed
at
the
joke
and
we
were
always
good
friends
dicky
roach
and
i
while
playing
one
night
in
louis
at
old
peritts
game
of
faro
and
dick
roach
was
dealing
luck
ran
dead
against
me
and
at
every
play
i
turned
up
loser
when
in
came
a
drunken
man
who
was
quarrelsome
and
insisted
on
annoying
me
i
told
him
that
i
was
in
no
condition
to
have
anybody
clawing
me
around
then
he
got
mad
and
wanted
to
fight
i
said
nothing
and
stood
it
as
long
as
i
could
when
i
got
up
out
of
my
chair
and
hit
him
a
slug
in
the
ear
that
curled
him
up
on
the
floor
like
a
possum
then
i
cashed
my
checks
and
set
out
for
a
walk
i
knocked
around
for
about
half
an
hour
and
got
to
thinking
about
how
much
money
i
had
lost
and
resolved
to
try
my
luck
again
there
was
no
other
bank
open
so
i
went
back
to
peritts
game
and
there
sprawled
out
on
the
floor
lay
the
big
lubber
that
i
had
knocked
over
and
roach
was
kneeling
down
by
him
and
rubbing
him
with
ice
water
and
a
towel
so
i
resolved
to
take
another
walk
when
roach
catching
sight
of
me
said
devol
i
guess
you
owe
me
something
for
taking
care
of
your
patient
and
if
that
the
way
you
hit
i
do
want
you
to
hit
me
been
rubbing
this
fellow
ever
since
you
left
dick
was
fond
of
fun
and
had
a
man
who
went
by
the
name
of
shell
fairchild
who
he
thought
could
throw
down
or
whip
anybody
and
he
was
willing
to
put
up
his
money
on
him
one
night
we
were
all
in
loops
saloon
when
fairchild
and
dick
roach
came
in
thurston
and
roach
got
into
an
argument
about
wrestling
and
thurston
said
i
have
got
a
man
that
can
put
your
man
on
his
back
for
this
dollar
bill
pulling
out
the
money
roach
covered
it
in
a
minute
and
then
thurston
asked
me
if
i
would
wrestle
him
yes
i
said
we
picked
out
a
place
tossed
off
our
coats
and
i
put
him
on
his
back
in
a
minute
that
was
satisfactory
so
i
did
it
again
satisfied
said
roach
as
he
handed
thurston
the
money
sherman
poor
fellow
bucked
the
fifty
dollars
right
against
the
bank
and
then
of
course
roach
got
it
all
back
again
and
sherman
only
regretted
that
he
had
stuck
roach
for
more
knocked
down
canada
bill
and
i
were
on
board
the
steamer
going
up
the
red
river
on
one
occasion
bill
was
doing
the
playing
and
i
was
driving
and
baiting
we
had
caught
a
nice
string
of
fish
and
had
about
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
were
no
more
of
our
kind
left
worth
fishing
for
when
a
nice
looking
young
man
came
swimming
up
we
thought
at
first
he
was
too
small
to
angle
for
but
you
ca
sometimes
always
tell
for
we
found
out
that
this
one
was
larger
than
anything
we
had
caught
that
evening
he
came
right
up
and
before
we
had
time
to
put
on
fresh
bait
wanted
to
bet
that
he
could
turn
the
winner
bill
said
all
right
i
go
you
just
once
and
began
counting
out
the
money
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
sucker
leather
and
gave
bill
the
office
to
raise
him
about
bill
then
said
i
just
raise
you
if
it
breaks
me
the
young
one
then
turned
to
me
and
asked
if
i
would
hold
the
money
i
told
him
that
i
did
not
like
to
hold
stakes
for
one
or
the
other
must
lose
when
two
men
bet
but
if
they
had
a
thorough
understanding
and
would
promise
not
to
quarrel
i
would
hold
the
money
the
sucker
replied
i
guess
i
understand
what
i
about
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
give
the
money
to
the
one
who
wins
it
all
right
says
i
but
i
know
the
loser
is
not
as
well
satisfied
as
the
winner
and
i
want
you
gentlemen
to
have
a
fair
understanding
put
up
your
money
and
i
will
hand
it
over
to
the
one
who
is
the
lucky
man
he
counted
out
what
he
thought
was
but
i
saw
it
was
for
i
was
not
a
bit
excited
although
i
did
not
like
to
hold
stakes
bill
put
up
for
he
heard
me
tell
the
young
man
he
had
put
up
that
amount
after
bill
had
mixed
them
up
and
said
he
was
ready
the
sucker
made
a
dive
and
nabbed
the
card
with
the
mark
on
it
but
it
was
not
the
winner
i
asked
him
if
i
should
give
up
the
money
just
as
if
i
did
not
know
anything
about
the
game
he
replied
i
made
a
mistake
give
him
the
money
i
handed
it
over
to
bill
and
said
to
the
young
man
as
he
was
walking
away
i
am
sorry
for
your
loss
but
some
one
must
lose
when
two
men
bet
he
replied
it
all
right
but
i
thought
i
had
a
sure
thing
after
we
closed
up
and
were
taking
our
i
said
to
bill
what
do
you
think
of
our
last
catch
well
george
when
that
chap
came
right
up
and
offered
to
bet
without
any
coaxing
i
thought
he
was
a
smart
one
and
may
be
he
would
get
the
right
card
i
do
believe
i
would
have
raised
that
if
it
had
not
been
he
wanted
you
to
hold
the
stakes
then
i
knew
he
was
a
sucker
sure
enough
we
had
another
and
then
went
to
bed
the
next
day
we
settled
up
and
when
bill
divided
the
we
had
won
on
the
last
shuffle
he
only
accounted
for
i
said
bill
that
fellow
put
up
i
guess
not
george
he
replied
but
i
could
see
that
he
had
knocked
down
on
me
my
visit
to
old
bill
a
short
time
after
the
occurrence
narrated
in
the
preceding
story
canada
bill
said
to
me
george
do
you
think
we
could
make
big
money
on
the
at
the
mouth
of
the
red
river
out
of
those
texas
boys
that
get
off
there
to
take
the
red
river
boats
i
replied
yes
there
is
plenty
of
money
there
bill
when
do
you
want
to
go
up
i
thought
he
wanted
to
stop
off
for
a
few
days
as
we
had
often
done
before
but
he
said
george
i
am
in
poor
health
and
i
want
to
quit
the
river
and
settle
down
and
i
want
you
to
be
with
me
i
did
not
blame
the
old
fellow
for
many
a
time
we
would
have
some
pretty
hard
knocks
and
duckings
in
our
business
on
the
rivers
and
railroads
but
i
was
well
and
hearty
and
then
i
was
of
a
roving
disposition
and
enjoyed
the
life
i
was
leading
so
i
said
bill
you
go
up
there
and
take
a
rest
just
as
long
as
you
like
but
for
me
i
could
not
think
of
settling
down
on
a
with
nothing
but
to
break
the
monotony
i
stick
to
the
old
thing
as
long
as
they
will
let
me
or
until
i
get
married
i
did
not
think
just
then
there
was
any
possibility
of
my
doing
the
latter
thing
but
men
do
always
know
just
what
they
will
do
for
i
am
married
now
and
have
a
dear
old
too
well
george
i
do
like
to
leave
you
but
i
will
try
her
just
once
anyhow
we
separated
bill
went
to
the
and
i
began
looking
for
another
partner
a
few
months
after
dissolving
partnership
with
my
old
friend
bill
i
met
a
man
from
red
river
who
told
me
that
bill
was
making
big
money
up
there
he
said
why
that
crazy
looking
old
fellow
is
running
a
corner
grocery
livery
stable
and
winning
all
the
money
and
horses
about
the
landing
i
was
not
sorry
he
was
doing
well
in
fact
i
was
glad
of
it
and
i
resolved
that
i
would
stop
off
on
my
next
trip
and
see
him
so
in
a
few
days
i
was
on
my
way
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
red
river
when
the
boat
landed
i
started
off
and
there
stood
the
old
fellow
just
as
natural
as
life
i
would
have
known
him
among
ten
thousand
he
caught
sight
of
me
and
then
he
began
to
stretch
those
long
thin
legs
of
his
and
in
an
instant
he
had
me
by
the
hand
saying
why
george
i
be
gol
darned
if
i
haint
glad
to
see
you
old
boy
come
right
up
and
let
take
something
we
had
a
few
drinks
talked
over
old
times
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
just
as
glad
to
see
the
old
boy
as
he
appeared
to
be
to
see
me
after
we
had
drank
enough
to
make
us
feel
pretty
good
bill
said
george
i
got
some
of
the
best
critters
in
my
barn
that
there
is
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
i
won
most
of
playing
the
baby
ticket
as
we
had
been
together
for
about
an
hour
and
had
got
no
further
than
the
bar
i
proposed
that
we
go
to
his
stables
and
see
the
horses
for
i
was
always
fond
of
good
stock
as
we
went
into
the
stable
we
saw
a
fellow
sitting
on
a
box
just
inside
of
the
open
doors
he
looked
like
a
with
his
large
whip
slouch
hat
pants
in
boots
all
covered
with
mud
and
an
old
pipe
in
his
mouth
i
did
not
take
much
notice
of
him
as
i
supposed
he
belonged
around
there
and
then
i
had
come
to
look
at
bill
fine
horses
while
we
were
looking
at
the
stock
some
one
called
bill
and
he
excused
himself
for
a
few
moments
in
a
short
time
bill
came
back
and
i
began
asking
him
some
questions
about
a
horse
i
had
been
looking
at
but
bill
did
not
appear
to
hear
me
but
said
george
did
you
notice
that
sitting
by
the
door
as
we
came
in
the
stable
yes
i
saw
a
fellow
sitting
there
but
i
supposed
he
belonged
around
here
and
i
did
not
pay
any
attention
to
him
why
george
what
do
you
think
that
fellow
is
out
there
on
the
box
counting
his
money
and
i
be
gol
darned
if
he
has
got
nigh
on
to
for
i
saw
him
counting
over
the
big
bills
until
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
and
i
just
came
back
here
to
get
you
for
i
know
george
that
you
can
get
it
if
any
man
can
i
replied
bill
i
did
think
that
old
tramp
had
any
money
but
if
you
saw
it
all
right
we
will
give
him
a
whirl
how
will
be
play
him
bill
then
said
well
george
you
go
and
get
in
with
him
and
when
you
are
all
ready
just
give
me
the
old
sign
and
i
will
come
up
and
try
the
old
monte
on
him
all
right
said
i
so
i
found
the
fellow
and
began
my
part
of
the
business
i
inquired
where
he
came
from
and
all
that
told
him
i
was
a
planter
waiting
for
a
boat
and
invited
him
to
take
a
drink
while
we
were
drinking
old
bill
came
up
rigged
out
just
as
i
had
seen
him
so
many
times
before
so
if
the
fellow
had
noticed
him
and
i
together
when
we
went
in
the
stable
he
would
not

the
same
person

the
old
crazy
looking
fool

so
i
said

and

a
drink
we
are
just
taking
one
bill

up
and
began
his
talk
about
where
he
had
been
where
he
was
going
and
how
he
had
lost
his
money
he
got
out
his
tickets
and
showed
us
how
the
game
was
played

bet

drinks
and
cigars

lost
then
i
put
a
spot
on
the
baby
and
won

to
get
nervous
and
finally
offered
to
bet
he
could
turn
over
the
baby

thought
his
time
had
come
so
he
said
i
just

driver
got
out
his
big
roll
and
counted

to

if
i

it
all
right
but
i
wo

any
foolishness
old
bill
gave
one
of
those
peculiar
chuckles
saying
all
right
if
you
win
her
you
shall
have
it
he
then
mixed
them
up
as
well
as
i
ever
saw
him
do
it
in
my
life
and
when
he
was
ready
the
driver
made
a
grab
and
we
both
thought
he
was
going
for
the
one
with
the
spot
on
it
but
i
be
darned
if
he
did
grab
up
the
one
with
the
baby
on
it
just
as
he
said
he
would
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
hand
over
that
money
for
i
won
it
bill
said
hold
on
that
one
rub
on
me
try
it
again
bull
just
yanked
out
a
gun
as
long
as
your
arm
and
drew
her
down
on
me
saying
see
here
i
want
that
money
d
d
quick
for
i
won
it
fair
he
then
turned
the
big
gun
on
bill
and
said
tell
him
to
hand
it
over
or
i
be
d
d
if
i
do
blow
h
l
out
of
you
d
d
quick
poor
old
bill
was
shaking
all
over
but
he
managed
to
say
give
her
up
george
he
forgot
himself
when
he
called
my
name
but
the
old
fellow
was
excited
and
did
not
know
that
he
was
giving
us
both
away
i
handed
the
fellow
the
money
and
he
walked
away
saying
i
want
any
more
to
do
with
you
d
d
fellows
for
you
are
in
with
each
other
bill
and
i
stood
looking
after
the
fellow
until
he
got
on
the
boat
then
he
turned
to
me
and
said
george
i
been
thinking
and
i
be
darned
if
i
can
make
out
how
it
was
he
turned
the
baby
and
george
another
thing
i
ca
understand
i
seen
more
than
ten
guns
cocked
up
against
your
head
and
that
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
you
weaken
well
bill
i
tell
you
there
was
blood
in
that
fellow
eyes
and
i
could
see
he
meant
business
besides
bill
he
won
the
money
fair
and
you
know
a
fellow
will
fight
like
thunder
for
his
own
all
right
george
but
i
always
said
no
man
living
could
make
you
give
up
but
i
guess
you
was
right
this
time
for
i
be
darned
if
i
did
think
he
was
going
to
let
her
go
at
me
before
you
could
hand
over
we
took
a
drink
and
then
bill
went
to
his
room
to
take
off
his
while
he
was
thus
engaged
i
walked
down
on
the
boat
and
there
was
the
waiting
for
a
boat
that
was
just
coming
in
to
the
landing
i
waited
for
bill
to
come
down
but
i
guess
he
was
feeling
bad
so
i
went
up
to
the
stable
and
there
he
sat
on
the
same
box
where
he
saw
the
counting
his
money
i
went
up
to
him
and
said
bill
i
won
and
lost
while
we
were
playing
that
fellow
so
i
owe
you
he
said
that
right
george
then
i
said
bill
you
only
put
up
against
his
but
i
called
it
that
right
george
well
bill
do
you
remember
the
fellow
that
put
up
against
the
and
you
thought
i
did
know
it
he
looked
all
around
the
stable
as
if
he
was
looking
for
the
driver
but
he
did
say
a
word
i
counted
out
and
handed
it
to
him
saying
bill
here
is
all
your
money
but
i
wanted
to
come
up
and
see
you
but
you
know
i
like
to
have
some
fun
at
the
expense
of
my
friends
and
it
cost
me
just
about
to
rig
out
the
to
play
you
for
a
sucker
bill
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
and
then
said
george
i
am
a
sucker
for
i
might
have
known
you
was
up
to
some
of
your
old
tricks
before
breakfast
after
settling
up
with
canada
bill
for
the
racket
i
said
to
him
well
old
boy
you
now
see
that
we
are
all
suckers
and
can
be
caught
if
the
bait
is
nicely
handled
you
right
george
he
replied
then
i
said
the
faro
banks
are
my
diet
and
short
cards
have
landed
you
many
a
time
but
i
must
confess
that
i
was
a
little
fearful
that
the
bait
i
had
fixed
up
for
you
would
not
land
a
sucker
but
it
did
all
the
same
did
it
bill
yes
george
was
all
he
would
say
well
now
bill
that
we
have
had
our
fun
let
shake
hands
and
be
good
friends
he
looked
at
me
for
an
instant
gave
one
of
those
old
chuckles
held
out
his
hand
and
said
all
right
george
we
went
over
to
the
bar
and
sealed
the
compact
with
a
he
arranged
his
business
and
we
started
on
the
once
more
and
were
together
for
two
years
after
that
and
made
a
world
of
money
but
we
were
both
suckers
when
our
kind
of
diet
was
spread
out
before
us
at
one
time
after
forming
our
new
partnership
we
made
our
headquarters
at
canton
and
worked
the
trains
up
and
down
the
railroad
we
made
big
money
during
the
week
but
on
saturday
night
we
would
run
down
to
new
orleans
and
get
away
with
the
most
of
it
before
monday
morning
we
were
at
the
canton
depot
one
evening
when
the
train
arrived
from
new
orleans
and
among
the
passengers
that
got
off
was
my
old
friend
jack
hardy
from
brookhaven
miss
he
was
one
of
the
best
men
that
the
sun
ever
shone
upon
and
loved
to
play
poker
better
than
to
eat
when
he
was
hungry
after
supper
we
got
up
a
game
with
some
of
the
canton
boys
to
amuse
my
friend
hardy
we
played
along
until
about
four
when
some
of
the
canton
boys
thought
i
had
bested
them
so
i
quit
and
went
to
bed
bill
was
not
in
the
game
but
had
gone
to
bed
early
as
we
were
to
take
the
up
train
at
about
six
in
the
morning
i
overslept
myself
and
the
train
had
left
when
i
reached
the
depot
i
did
not
see
old
bill
so
i
went
back
to
the
hotel
about
eight
i
went
in
to
breakfast
while
i
was
enjoying
my
morning
meal
old
bill
walked
in
and
sat
down
with
me
saying
george
where
was
you
this
morning
when
the
up
train
came
in
i
replied
i
was
up
late
last
night
playing
poker
with
hardy
and
the
canton
boys
and
overslept
myself
but
what
in
the
d
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
for
i
walked
down
to
the
depot
to
find
you
for
i
knew
you
would
not
go
out
without
me
well
george
i
did
go
up
about
six
miles
but
could
not
find
you
on
the
train
so
i
got
off
and
walked
back
the
h
l
you
did
says
i
yes
george
i
went
up
and
if
you
had
been
with
me
we
would
have
made
over
for
the
train
was
full
of
the
best
suckers
i
ever
saw
i
d
d
sorry
but
i
wanted
to
entertain
my
old
friend
hardy
and
that
what
i
get
for
neglecting
business
bill
then
said
george
we
got
out
of
the
trip
anyway
and
here
is
your
half
i
laughed
and
told
bill
he
had
done
well
to
make
so
much
and
walk
six
miles
before
breakfast
he
did
not
need
to
tell
me
of
his
winnings
for
i
could
hardly
believe
him
when
he
did
but
the
driver
racket
at
the
mouth
of
red
river
had
taught
him
a
good
lesson
and
i
believe
did
him
good
at
least
it
did
me
to
the
amount
of
before
breakfast
foot
race
one
day
after
bill
and
i
had
worked
the
morning
train
on
the
jackson
road
with
that
degree
of
success
which
was
warranted
by
our
prudence
and
perseverance
we
took
an
afternoon
train
into
the
city
and
as
i
was
glancing
through
the
cars
i
spied
both
of
the
superintendents
aboard
so
of
course
i
made
up
my
mind
that
there
would
be
no
playing
on
that
train
to
make
the
matter
doubly
sure
one
of
them
came
to
me
and
said
george
do
not
play
any
on
our
trains
certainly
not
gentlemen
and
you
can
rest
assured
of
that
while
you
are
aboard
i
said
to
myself
we
had
not
traveled
far
when
the
news
came
that
a
freight
train
was
ditched
a
short
distance
up
the
road
our
train
stopped
and
the
superintendents
went
to
the
wreck
of
the
engine
then
i
saw
my
chance
and
got
up
a
foot
race
among
the
passengers
meanwhile
billy
opened
up
on
a
log
as
the
contestants
were
getting
ready
to
run
a
crowd
soon
collected
around
billy
booth
and
he
garnered
in
good
dollars
and
some
fine
gold
watches
up
came
the
engine
and
when
the
superintendents
heard
of
it
they
said
we
might
have
known
that
devol
would
fix
up
some
plan
to
get
these
suckers
money
thus
it
was
that
i
was
always
blamed
for
all
the
devilment
that
was
done
i
really
believe
if
a
horse
had
been
stolen
the
verdict
would
have
been
devol
did
it
forty
miles
an
hour
the
train
was
going
out
of
louisville
the
rate
of
speed
was
forty
miles
an
hour
ten
owen
county
yahoos
had
been
beaten
at
monte
they
pulled
at
long
black
bottles
the
vacuum
made
by
the
loss
of
their
money
they
filled
with
whisky
boys
let
have
our
money
and
watches
back
or
kill
that
gambler
shouted
one
of
them
owen
county
boys
are
rough
and
tough
it
a
word
and
a
blow
and
the
blow
first
when
in
crowd
together
owen
county
boys
are
as
brave
as
a
warrior
and
alone
they
are
as
cowardly
as
a
sick
kitten
canada
bill
was
not
well
so
i
had
been
doing
the
playing
bill
did
the
capping
and
as
he
lost
their
suspicion
did
not
light
on
him
i
suddenly
had
an
idea
i
rushed
back
into
the
hind
sleeper
and
gave
the
porter
a
bill
tell
them
the
door
is
locked
and
i
have
the
key
were
my
words
i
was
none
too
quick
the
train
was
going
at
forty
miles
an
hour
and
was
sixteen
minutes
behind
time
la
grange
was
only
three
miles
off
and
well
i
knew
that
if
i
got
off
there
i
would
have
to
give
up
did
i
want
to
give
up
my
money
never
lowering
my
body
carefully
at
a
clear
spot
in
the
road
i
jumped
took
chances
broke
no
bones
rolled
over
in
the
dirt
and
heard
a
shower
of
bullets
whizzing
past
my
ears
from
the
fast
receding
train
that
was
soon
out
of
sight
fortunately
the
country
was
not
new
to
me
and
skipping
over
a
fence
i
avoided
la
grange
and
soon
reached
the
lexington
junction
some
distance
above
have
you
heard
the
news
said
a
switchman
no
what
is
it
the
owen
county
boys
have
just
killed
some
gamblers
a
short
distance
below
la
grange
glad
of
it
was
all
the
response
he
got
meantime
i
walked
in
towards
lexington
at
the
first
station
i
boarded
a
train
for
lexington
put
up
at
the
hotel
for
a
couple
of
days
and
there
revived
an
acquaintance
with
clem
payne
clerk
of
the
hotel
whom
i
had
known
twenty
years
or
so
ago
at
kansas
city
one
morning
i
was
called
for
the
early
train
for
louisville
and
while
waiting
for
breakfast
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
large
fat
man
who
was
going
on
a
stage
journey
afar
back
in
the
country
we
got
into
conversation
i
was
always
partial
to
conversation
with
strangers
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
showed
him
the
big
three
he
became
intensely
interested
and
in
a
few
moments
i
had
his
twelve
bills
i
did
not
deem
it
advisable
to
wait
for
breakfast
but
paying
my
bill
jumped
into
a
hack
and
drove
to
the
first
station
in
time
to
make
the
train
before
la
grange
was
reached
i
entered
the
and
told
the
to
pile
the
trunks
all
around
me
i
was
thus
completely
hid
as
snug
as
a
bug
in
a
rug
when
la
grange
was
reached
there
were
signs
of
tumult
about
five
of
the
owen
county
gang
were
at
the
depot
and
they
boarded
every
train
and
had
been
doing
it
for
two
days
a
newsboy
gave
me
away
and
told
them
where
i
was
secreted
they
all
then
remained
on
board
and
kept
a
regular
watch
over
me
until
louisville
was
reached
the
train
moves
slowly
through
the
city
i
quietly
slipped
off
not
quick
enough
however
for
one
of
them
espied
me
and
pulling
his
revolver
shot
not
me
but
himself
his
companions
all
ran
he
lay
upon
the
ground
bellowing
like
a
calf
and
said
i
had
shot
him
the
police
arrested
me
shadburne
was
the
chief
of
police
i
related
to
him
the
true
facts
of
the
case
release
that
man
he
said
i
will
be
responsible
for
his
appearance
in
the
morning
morning
came
and
the
owen
county
deputation
were
early
at
the
with
a
lawyer
they
wanted
to
compromise
for
no
sir
not
for
a
cent
they
dropped
to
the
lawyer
wanted
i
gave
them
and
they
went
off
with
their
stuff
bill
would
gamble
one
of
bill
most
striking
peculiarities
was
his
love
for
gambling
he
loved
gambling
for
its
own
sake
just
as
the
moralists
love
virtue
for
its
own
sake
no
man
that
i
ever
came
in
contact
with
ever
struck
me
as
being
so
fond
of
gambling
i
have
seen
him
give
parties
two
points
in
casino
and
and
they
would
play
marked
cards
on
him
on
one
occasion
when
we
had
a
settlement
there
was
in
small
gold
coin
which
i
told
him
to
keep
and
we
would
fix
it
up
at
some
other
time
no
he
would
have
it
that
way
he
wanted
to
play
for
it
this
i
positively
declined
saying
that
when
partners
played
together
it
sometimes
broke
friendship
and
gave
rise
to
hard
feelings
but
he
insisted
until
at
last
i
played
him
we
cut
for
deal
and
he
dealt
hearts
were
trumps
i
stood
and
made
three
to
his
nothing
i
dealt
he
begged
i
gave
him
one
and
made
three
more
thus
i
was
six
to
his
one
he
dealt
and
i
picked
up
the
queen
and
stood
which
was
high
i
went
out
and
refused
to
play
any
more
but
bill
was
bound
to
play
with
somebody
so
he
picked
up
a
man
and
gave
him
two
points
in
and
they
kept
at
it
all
day
until
bill
lost
no
good
at
short
cards
bill
could
play
any
short
card
game
monte
was
his
hold
and
the
gamblers
knew
it
i
never
knew
bill
to
play
at
a
short
card
game
that
he
did
not
quit
loser
and
i
have
known
him
to
play
as
long
as
seventy
hours
at
a
sitting
one
night
we
were
on
a
boat
that
was
putting
off
freight
at
the
that
lay
at
the
mouth
of
red
river
bill
was
in
his
element
he
had
a
big
pile
of
money
up
in
front
of
him
and
a
large
crowd
intent
on
watching
the
game
soon
i
noticed
a
fellow
sitting
at
bill
right
who
was
fishing
for
one
of
the
bills
trying
to
coax
it
over
to
his
side
of
the
house
i
waited
patiently
until
he
got
it
then
went
around
to
him
and
said
is
that
the
way
you
gamble
where
you
live
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
said
still
holding
his
hand
over
the
stolen
bill
i
gave
his
hand
a
push
and
there
lay
the
bill
which
i
grabbed
then
turning
to
bill
i
said
you
would
sit
here
and
let
these
ducks
steal
all
your
money
wo
you
never
drop
to
anything
the
fellow
was
on
his
feet
in
a
minute
shouting
that
is
my
money
i
took
it
out
of
my
pocket
and
was
waiting
for
a
chance
to
bet
it
you
lie
you
were
trying
to
steal
it
three
or
four
of
his
friends
at
that
arose
and
i
knew
that
war
was
in
sight
so
i
slipped
my
big
gun
into
my
overcoat
pocket
and
expected
h
but
just
then
somebody
yelled
monte
and
the
mate
coming
up
the
facts
of
the
case
were
stated
to
him
and
he
said
everybody
must
keep
quiet
bill
of
course
cleaned
the
crowd
out
and
reached
the
with
a
large
roll
of
the
good
green
stuff
but
he
did
not
keep
it
long
for
jack
armstrong
of
louisville
was
lying
there
in
wait
for
him
to
play
casino
at
a
game
monumental
gall
there
are
some
men
who
when
they
are
caught
once
like
burned
children
ever
after
dread
the
fire
others
there
are
who
have
such
overweening
confidence
in
their
own
smartness
that
their
lives
are
nothing
but
a
series
of
losses
canada
bill
and
myself
were
nearing
magnolia
about
a
hundred
miles
above
new
orleans
when
bill
opened
up
his
three
cards
it
was
not
long
before
a
crowd
gathered
about
to
witness
the
sport
one
large
man
in
particular
watched
the
play
as
a
hawk
does
a
chicken
this
i
was
not
slow
to
perceive
so
turning
to
bill
i
said
what
you
bet
i
ca
turn
the
baby
that
no
man
can
turn
it
i
pulled
out
a
roll
that
looked
like
though
it
was
not
for
we
had
been
playing
bank
and
were
nearly
busted
bill
won
and
i
lost
then
he
said
in
his
screechy
voice
by
golly
you
see
i
got
two
cards
to
your
one
and
can
win
every
time
the
big
fellow
was
getting
terribly
worked
up
for
he
knew
that
the
corner
of
the
baby
card
was
turned
up
then
he
commenced
getting
out
his
money
and
i
was
soon
by
his
side
can
you
guess
it
i
innocently
asked
if
you
can
tell
me
so
i
can
get
even
but
he
was
too
selfish
and
proposed
to
win
it
all
he
offered
to
bet
but
bill
would
have
anything
but
a
bet
up
went
the
money
quicker
than
you
could
say
jack
robinson
the
result
is
easily
foreshadowed
the
man
turned
up
the
wrong
card
he
made
a
grab
however
for
the
money
but
i
was
in
a
second
between
him
and
the
stuff
so
that
bill
got
there
first
there
going
to
be
trouble
bill
i
whispered
get
off
he
lost
no
time
in
obeying
the
train
was
just
leaving
the
station
the
fat
man
followed
and
chased
bill
around
the
car
bill
jumped
back
so
did
the
fat
man
then
bill
slid
off
again
but
the
fat
man
was
at
his
heels
this
could
not
last
long
bill
slim
build
helped
him
in
the
emergency
and
again
he
caught
the
train
the
fat
man
was
unable
to
but
the
conductor
backed
the
cars
and
took
him
aboard
where
is
the
tramp
cowboy
that
robbed
me
he
excitedly
demanded
he
jumped
off
as
you
got
on
i
would
mind
the
loss
of
the
money
he
said
but
the
idea
of
being
swindled
out
of
it
by
such
a
cowboy
looking
kind
of
tramp
breaks
me
all
up
where
was
bill
in
the
sleeper
was
a
young
man
who
had
taken
off
a
cowboy
suit
of
clothes
put
on
a
bran
new
suit
of
black
broadcloth
gold
face
this
looking
fellow
soon
came
into
the
car
where
the
big
man
and
myself
were
talking
over
the
loss
and
sat
down
near
us
i
was
busy
pumping
the
sucker
to
see
if
he
had
any
more
money
why
anybody
can
play
that
game
he
said
and
of
course
i
remarked
the
dealer
though
has
every
advantage
as
he
has
two
cards
to
your
one
if
i
had
some
cards
i
would
show
you
how
it
is
done
that
was
enough
for
the
man
and
slipping
back
into
the
sleeper
he
procured
some
cards
and
dropped
them
down
into
one
of
the
seats
near
me
i
saw
them
and
picked
them
up
observing
i
believe
these
are
the
same
cards
the
sucker
looked
at
them
and
declared
that
he
believed
they
were
i
began
playing
the
cards
but
the
fat
fellow
said
you
are
pretty
good
but
you
ca
handle
them
like
the
cowboy
did
it
wants
practice
i
said
i
practiced
on
when
up
stepped
the
individual
saying
i
bet
you
a
dollar
i
can
guess
the
card
oh
i
do
want
to
bet
with
any
boy
preacher
i
said
i
no
boy
preacher
i
studying
to
become
a
priest
you
better
keep
that
dollar
that
my
advice
i
was
only
waiting
for
bill
to
put
a
mark
on
the
card
which
he
soon
did
while
i
went
back
to
get
a
drink
as
i
came
back
they
all
began
to
laugh
at
me
and
the
big
fellow
said
any
fool
could
tell
the
card
the
way
you
throw
them
then
i
pretended
to
get
mad
so
i
offered
to
bet
that
no
man
could
turn
the
right
card
the
priest
spoke
up
i
bet
you
in
gold
that
i
can
do
it
put
it
up
i
said
this
made
the
sucker
crazy
for
he
was
so
anxious
to
get
even
that
he
pulled
out
and
counted
down
but
i
would
not
bet
less
than
there
was
a
little
man
standing
near
who
offered
to
loan
him
the
to
make
up
the
when
bill
turned
and
said
i
bet
you
that
my
friend
the
big
man
wins
talk
about
monumental
gall
i
thought
then
that
calling
the
fat
man
his
friend
who
a
few
moments
before
had
been
chasing
him
around
ready
to
kill
him
was
about
the
grandest
specimen
of
sublime
impudence
that
i
ever
saw
the
big
fellow
turned
the
card
and
lost
as
usual
and
the
little
man
looked
at
me
then
at
the
fat
man
as
much
as
to
say
you
two
rascals
are
partners
he
took
the
priest
aside
who
was
no
other
than
canada
bill
and
assured
him
that
he
was
positive
of
this
fact
i
won
the
money
and
there
was
no
kick
close
calls
i
never
will
forget
the
night
that
canada
bill
and
myself
were
on
the
michigan
southern
road
where
we
had
been
working
for
some
time
and
finally
shaken
down
a
man
for
he
telegraphed
ahead
for
a
warrant
to
arrest
canada
bill
and
i
knew
that
bill
would
have
to
hustle
as
the
cars
would
be
searched
i
hurried
him
into
the
sleeper
and
found
a
top
berth
that
was
empty
while
a
lady
occupied
the
lower
her
dress
was
laying
in
the
top
berth
and
she
was
fast
asleep
in
the
lower
one
bill
jump
into
this
i
cried
holding
up
the
garment
he
refused
at
first
but
as
the
emergency
was
desperate
at
last
consented
and
tying
a
handkerchief
around
his
head
his
face
being
as
smooth
as
a
baby
made
as
fine
a
looking
woman
as
you
would
want
to
see
along
came
the
officers
with
the
conductor
and
lantern
and
searched
all
the
berths
in
the
sleeper
but
as
soon
as
they
spied
the
two
ladies
in
the
two
berths
upper
and
lower
they
apologized
and
hastily
withdrew
when
i
was
asked
where
bill
was
i
informed
everybody
that
he
had
gotten
off
and
i
feared
was
seriously
injured
reaching
detroit
early
in
the
morning
bill
managed
to
escape
from
the
cars
unnoticed
and
i
got
out
at
the
depot
as
if
nothing
had
happened
another
time
on
the
missouri
pacific
from
kansas
city
to
louis
bill
and
i
succeeded
in
beating
a
jew
out
of
a
few
hundred
dollars
he
was
a
gamey
little
son
of
abraham
and
like
all
the
rest
of
his
class
loved
money
as
a
duck
does
water
so
when
he
was
on
the
platform
he
drew
a
pistol
from
his
hip
pocket
and
resolved
in
an
instant
to
die
thinking
no
doubt
it
was
preferable
for
a
jew
to
be
dead
rather
than
penniless
placing
the
muzzle
to
his
mouth
he
pulled
the
trigger
a
flash
loud
report
when
all
the
passengers
rushed
out
to
see
what
had
happened
the
jew
lay
on
the
platform
bleeding
at
the
mouth
we
straightened
him
up
held
over
his
head
to
spit
out
the
blood
when
out
dropped
the
bullet
two
of
his
teeth
were
gone
which
must
have
checked
the
speed
of
the
bullet
as
it
had
found
lodgment
in
the
rear
of
his
mouth
of
course
he
did
die
but
he
had
a
close
call
bill
and
i
made
a
good
deal
of
money
one
night
going
up
on
the
cars
from
jackson
to
vicksburg
the
suckers
began
to
kick
and
i
saw
trouble
ahead
so
i
told
bill
to
hustle
into
the
sleeper
but
he
sat
still
i
went
on
into
the
smoking
car
a
large
man
grappled
bill
and
pulling
a
long
demanded
every
dollar
he
had
won
and
the
watches
the
conductor
hurriedly
called
me
and
grabbing
my
betsy
jane
i
rushed
back
just
in
time
to
knock
one
of
the
men
senseless
with
the
butt
end
of
the
weapon
which
i
drew
on
the
rest
and
held
them
at
bay
this
was
long
enough
to
allow
bill
a
chance
to
reach
the
platform
pull
the
bell
cord
and
jump
off
i
was
not
long
in
following
and
that
too
was
too
close
a
call
to
be
styled
pleasant
a
euchre
hand
one
evening
i
played
a
game
of
euchre
on
the
with
a
sucker
i
gave
him
a
big
hand
and
told
him
i
could
euchre
him
he
offered
to
bet
and
i
bet
him
up
went
the
money
when
down
came
the
clerk
who
i
knew
would
stop
the
game
but
quickly
giving
my
hand
to
my
partner
i
rushed
up
and
grabbed
the
clerk
good
naturedly
holding
him
until
bill
had
all
the
stuff
taken
the
clerk
made
a
holy
howl
and
a
terrible
kick
but
i
gave
him
the
laugh
telling
him
that
if
he
made
me
give
up
the
money
it
would
be
taking
the
bread
and
meat
out
of
my
mouth
this
amused
him
and
no
more
was
said
i
was
playing
in
a
game
of
poker
at
one
time
and
one
of
the
party
was
a
friend
of
mine
i
saw
i
could
win
some
big
money
if
i
could
get
my
friend
out
of
the
game
i
tried
every
way
i
could
to
run
him
out
but
he
was
game
and
would
not
run
so
i
at
last
ran
him
up
a
hand
and
then
broke
him
then
he
retired
in
good
order
after
getting
him
out
i
started
in
and
made
the
balance
of
the
party
sick
in
less
than
no
time
after
the
game
broke
up
i
found
my
friend
and
asked
him
how
much
he
lost
he
told
me
i
handed
him
the
amount
saying
i
tried
to
get
you
out
of
the
game
without
winning
your
money
but
you
would
not
go
so
all
i
could
do
was
to
break
you
but
i
never
try
to
beat
a
friend
so
i
want
you
to
have
all
your
money
back
he
thanked
me
very
kindly
and
said
george
if
you
ever
want
a
favor
that
is
in
my
power
to
grant
do
not
hesitate
to
ask
it
of
me
for
i
will
be
happy
to
grant
it
the
above
is
one
of
the
many
similar
circumstances
that
i
have
experienced
during
my
forty
years
as
a
gambler
i
always
loved
to
play
a
social
game
with
my
friends
for
a
small
limit
and
i
never
took
any
advantage
unless
it
was
for
a
joke
or
to
run
a
friend
out
and
then
i
would
return
all
i
had
won
bill
present
my
old
friend
and
partner
canada
bill
presented
me
with
a
very
fine
shotgun
which
i
would
often
take
with
me
when
we
were
out
on
our
trips
we
were
on
the
railroad
one
morning
and
i
had
the
gun
with
me
we
had
left
our
baggage
in
the
ladies
car
and
were
over
in
the
smoker
when
we
saw
a
sucker
we
went
to
work
on
him
in
the
usual
way
and
it
was
not
long
until
bill
had
of
his
money
i
expected
he
would
kick
from
the
way
he
was
squirming
around
so
i
gave
bill
the
office
to
get
off
and
i
went
back
in
the
ladies
car
where
we
had
left
our
baggage
old
bill
was
sometimes
slow
in
getting
off
after
he
had
won
the
money
and
on
this
occasion
he
was
again
behind
time
i
had
not
been
seated
but
a
moment
when
a
brakeman
came
running
in
and
told
me
my
partner
was
in
trouble
i
jumped
up
grabbed
my
shotgun
and
started
for
the
and
i
did
not
get
there
any
too
soon
for
the
sucker
had
bill
crouching
in
a
seat
and
was
standing
over
him
with
a
big
gun
covering
him
he
had
given
bill
but
two
minutes
to
give
up
the
money
and
bill
had
out
his
roll
counting
her
out
i
rushed
up
struck
the
big
fellow
with
the
new
gun
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
knocked
him
senseless
his
big
gun
dropped
on
the
floor
i
picked
it
up
and
stuck
it
in
my
pocket
bill
lit
out
as
soon
as
he
could
get
out
of
his
seat
and
left
me
to
look
after
the
big
fellow
on
the
floor
with
the
assistance
of
some
of
the
passengers
i
got
him
up
and
found
he
was
pretty
badly
hurt
i
told
him
i
was
sorry
i
had
hit
him
but
i
thought
he
was
going
to
kill
the
old
fellow
he
said
i
was
only
trying
to
scare
him
so
he
would
give
me
back
my
money
as
it
was
all
i
had
i
could
not
have
shot
him
if
i
had
wanted
to
as
the
pistol
was
not
loaded
i
pulled
out
the
old
thing
and
sure
enough
there
was
not
a
load
in
it
i
asked
the
fellow
what
business
he
was
engaged
in
and
he
told
me
he
was
a
as
that
was
my
father
business
i
felt
very
sorry
for
him
and
i
gave
him
and
left
the
train
at
the
next
station
i
learned
from
the
brakeman
that
bill
had
dropped
off
a
few
miles
back
and
i
knew
he
would
show
up
soon
so
i
left
the
baggage
at
the
depot
took
my
gun
and
made
for
the
woods
robbins
were
plentiful
and
in
a
short
time
i
had
eight
nice
birds
for
our
breakfast
i
went
back
to
the
station
where
i
found
old
bill
waiting
for
me
he
was
glad
to
see
me
and
the
birds
so
he
said
george
i
glad
i
bought
that
gun
for
you
for
it
saved
my
life
besides
we
will
have
birds
for
breakfast
i
replied
yes
bill
that
was
the
worst
fellow
you
ever
met
he
would
have
killed
you
sure
with
that
big
gun
good
luck
canada
bill
and
i
went
over
from
canton
to
vicksburg
at
one
time
to
catch
a
boat
for
new
orleans
we
met
all
the
boys
and
had
a
good
time
while
waiting
for
a
boat
the
meader
boys
jesse
and
aud
had
fitted
up
very
fine
faro
rooms
but
a
short
time
before
our
visit
and
they
were
very
glad
to
see
us
jesse
wanted
to
buy
all
the
wine
in
vicksburg
for
me
for
he
knew
i
was
a
good
producer
after
he
had
expended
about
for
wine
he
invited
me
to
go
down
and
see
their
rooms
he
did
not
ask
me
to
play
he
said
just
come
down
george
and
see
our
new
place
i
went
down
and
took
a
survey
of
the
house
and
then
i
was
introduced
to
the
where
aud
was
doing
the
honors
they
knew
well
i
could
not
see
a
bank
in
full
blast
without
changing
in
i
told
aud
to
give
me
worth
of
checks
and
i
would
try
my
luck
in
the
new
house
i
got
the
checks
and
they
gave
me
a
front
seat
so
that
i
could
bet
all
over
the
if
i
so
desired
on
the
first
deal
i
won
out
about
aud
shuffled
up
again
with
a
great
deal
of
care
and
i
started
in
again
i
played
three
deals
and
then
looked
up
at
aud
saying
this
is
too
much
of
a
and
i
guess
i
will
quit
for
i
do
want
to
miss
that
boat
i
cashed
in
my
checks
and
i
had
won
just
some
of
the
boys
laughed
but
jesse
and
aud
looked
as
sober
as
mose
wilson
used
to
look
when
he
was
on
the
police
bench
saying
thirty
fifty
the
meader
boys
were
game
to
the
backbone
and
although
they
could
not
laugh
with
the
other
boys
when
i
made
my
first
play
in
their
new
house
they
did
ask
me
to
have
some
wine
and
gave
me
a
very
pressing
invitation
to
come
and
see
them
again
for
well
they
knew
my
luck
would
change
and
then
they
could
laugh
as
heartily
as
any
of
the
boys
they
were
right
for
if
i
had
the
money
i
have
lost
in
vicksburg
alone
i
could
go
into
the
furniture
business
and
carry
as
large
a
stock
on
a
cash
basis
as
any
house
in
this
country
bill
and
i
caught
the
boat
for
new
orleans
and
i
was
ahead
we
made
good
money
going
down
but
it
was
nearly
all
deposited
in
the
faro
bank
before
we
left
the
city
governor
pinchback
great
oaks
from
little
acorns
grow
and
you
can
never
tell
the
eminent
position
to
which
the
little
ragged
boy
may
climb
if
he
has
good
luck
there
is
governor
pinchback
of
louisiana
he
was
my
boy
i
raised
him
and
trained
him
i
took
him
out
of
a
steamboat
barber
shop
i
instructed
him
in
the
mysteries
of
playing
and
he
was
an
apt
pupil
never
shall
i
forget
the
night
we
left
new
orleans
on
the
steamer
there
was
a
strong
team
of
us
tom
brown
holly
chappell
and
the
boy
pinch
we
sent
pinch
and
staked
him
to
open
a
game
of
with
the
niggers
on
deck
while
we
opened
up
monte
in
the
cabin
the
run
of
luck
that
evening
was
something
grand
to
behold
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
solitary
man
on
the
boat
that
did
not
drop
around
in
the
course
of
the
evening
and
lose
his
bundle
when
about
thirty
miles
from
new
orleans
a
heavy
fog
overtook
us
and
it
was
our
purpose
to
get
off
and
walk
about
six
miles
to
kennersville
where
we
could
take
the
cars
to
the
city
pinchback
got
our
valises
together
and
a
start
was
made
a
drizzling
rain
was
falling
and
the
darkness
was
so
great
that
one
could
not
see
his
hand
before
his
face
each
of
us
grabbed
a
valise
except
pinch
who
carried
along
the
faro
tools
the
walking
was
so
slippery
that
we
were
in
the
mud
about
every
ten
steps
and
poor
pinch
he
groaned
under
the
load
that
he
carried
at
last
he
broke
out
tell
you
what
it
is
master
devol
i
be
dumbed
if
this
aint
rough
on
pinch
ise
going
to
do
better
than
this
toting
along
old
faro
tools
what
that
pinch
what
you
going
to
do
ise
going
to
get
into
that
good
old
legislature
and
i
make
rome
howl
if
i
get
there
of
course
i
thought
at
the
time
that
this
was
all
bravado
and
brag
but
the
boy
was
in
earnest
and
sure
enough
he
got
into
the
legislature
became
and
by
the
death
of
the
governor
he
slipped
into
the
gubernatorial
chair
and
at
last
crawled
into
the
united
states
senate
he
did
me
a
good
turn
when
he
got
up
in
the
world
and
true
and
high
honor
did
not
dim
the
kindly
feeling
he
had
for
me
i
had
been
playing
on
the
jackson
railroad
and
my
luck
had
been
good
but
i
was
satisfied
from
certain
ominous
signs
that
a
big
kick
was
brewing
to
avoid
trouble
i
got
off
the
train
a
few
miles
before
reaching
the
city
and
had
been
in
town
a
day
or
two
when
the
chief
of
police
sent
for
me
of
course
i
responded
when
he
told
me
devol
you
have
beat
one
of
the
police
commissioners
out
of
and
he
says
you
live
in
the
city
i
have
lived
in
the
city
too
many
years
to
be
run
out
by
any
one
man
thinking
it
best
to
have
this
matter
settled
i
went
to
my
old
friend
bush
and
we
took
a
hack
and
drove
to
the
executive
mansion
pinchback
my
old
boy
was
governor
then
and
though
it
was
late
at
night
he
insisted
on
calling
us
in
woke
up
all
the
servants
and
set
out
a
royal
lunch
with
all
sorts
of
liquors
and
we
had
a
high
old
time
go
to
bed
george
he
said
and
do
give
yourself
any
uneasiness
i
settle
that
fellow
in
the
morning
that
was
the
end
of
the
police
commissioner
a
good
stakeholder
sherman
thurston
my
old
friend
is
dead
he
has
passed
in
his
checks
shuffled
his
last
cards
dealt
his
final
and
been
gathered
to
the
gods
he
was
an
honorable
man
and
i
can
recall
the
time
when
no
living
man
could
do
him
up
in
a
fight
tripp
was
once
doing
the
playing
for
me
on
the
missouri
pacific
railroad
and
as
i
saw
sherman
i
said
to
him
see
that
conductor
i
got
a
little
game
going
on
here
and
a
sucker
in
tow
now
the
conductor
is
watching
us
very
closely
and
as
soon
as
he
sees
him
put
up
his
money
he
will
walk
up
and
stop
the
game
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
to
go
and
sit
alongside
of
him
and
entertain
him
until
the
lawful
proceedings
are
over
tripp
opened
up
the
game
and
the
sucker
put
up
his
stuff
and
sure
enough
the
conductor
made
a
rush
to
stop
the
game
but
sherman
grabbed
him
by
the
waist
and
held
him
as
you
would
a
baby
and
kept
on
talking
all
the
time
telling
him
not
to
have
any
fuss
that
he
did
want
to
see
any
trouble
etc
sherman
thurston
was
the
best
stakeholder
in
america
he
was
death
to
pullers
he
had
a
way
of
acting
as
if
he
was
in
a
terrible
passion
and
coming
down
on
their
feet
with
a
stamp
that
made
them
lie
quiet
sherman
was
a
man
of
hard
sense
and
native
resources
that
rendered
him
ready
for
any
emergency
once
when
we
had
won
some
money
from
a
man
he
began
to
raise
a
fuss
and
carry
on
like
one
bereft
of
reason
sherman
humored
him
he
locked
him
up
in
the
car
and
told
everybody
that
he
was
a
lunatic
that
he
was
removing
to
the
asylum
to
keep
away
from
him
as
he
was
dangerous
and
entirely
irresponsible
then
when
the
fellow
got
too
noisy
sherman
went
and
said
see
here
old
fellow
you
had
better
keep
still
for
gambling
is
a
penitentiary
offense
in
this
state
and
you
are
just
as
much
implicated
as
the
man
who
won
your
money
that
settled
it
and
the
man
quieted
down
as
mild
as
a
pet
lamb
she
kissed
me
a
woman
shriek
rang
through
the
cabin
of
the
steamer
one
afternoon
as
she
lay
taking
in
wood
i
was
standing
on
the
guards
watching
the
jolly
happy
negroes
as
they
seized
the
huge
sticks
and
ran
to
the
music
of
their
hymns
and
piled
it
near
the
engine
rushing
back
i
saw
that
a
little
girl
had
fallen
overboard
into
the
water
losing
no
time
i
jumped
overboard
and
got
ashore
with
the
little
one
when
i
carried
her
dripping
and
wet
to
her
parents
who
stood
on
the
plank
the
mother
caught
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
nearly
smothered
her
with
kisses
and
my
turn
came
next
for
she
began
to
hug
and
kiss
me
pouring
forth
her
gratitude
but
i
pushed
her
away
as
i
did
not
want
her
husband
to
see
her
kiss
me
the
little
one
was
taken
into
the
ladies
cabin
and
dry
clothes
put
on
her
and
the
father
came
down
and
wanted
to
recompense
me
but
i
would
not
have
it
for
i
said
i
have
only
done
what
i
would
for
any
child
that
was
drowning
years
afterwards
i
met
the
young
lady
and
her
father
traveling
on
one
of
the
new
orleans
packets
she
had
grown
to
be
a
beautiful
young
lady
but
her
mother
had
been
dead
many
years
the
trick
knife
there
are
a
great
many
devices
some
of
which
are
very
old
some
a
little
more
modern
and
some
new
ones
are
being
manufactured
every
day
to
catch
the
uninitiated
all
of
which
are
more
or
less
successful
for
there
are
just
as
many
suckers
as
there
were
forty
years
ago
i
remember
seeing
a
knife
that
was
so
constructed
that
the
blade
could
not
be
opened
without
pressing
upon
springs
it
had
one
spring
that
if
pressed
would
allow
the
blade
to
open
and
there
was
another
spring
that
would
lock
the
first
one
so
that
it
would
not
work
and
when
the
second
spring
was
used
no
one
could
open
the
blade
with
the
first
spring
alone
like
most
tricks
this
knife
racket
took
two
persons
to
work
it
successfully
the
one
with
the
knife
would
be
dressed
up
like
a
countryman
and
he
would
go
up
to
a
person
who
he
thought
could
be
played
for
a
sucker
and
enter
into
conversation
with
him
finally
he
would
show
the
knife
and
explain
how
to
open
the
blade
when
locked
with
but
one
spring
about
this
time
the
capper
a
well
dressed
man
would
come
up
and
the
country
looking
fellow
that
owned
the
knife
would
say
to
the
sucker
there
comes
a
fellow
say
nothing
to
him
about
the
spring
and
we
will
win
some
money
the
capper
would
take
the
knife
and
try
to
open
it
then
he
would
say
that
is
a
dummy
it
was
not
made
to
open
the
owner
of
the
knife
would
then
say
yes
it
can
be
opened
then
the
nice
man
would
try
it
again
and
finally
he
would
offer
to
bet
that
no
man
could
open
the
knife
in
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
the
sucker
would
take
him
up
and
as
he
did
not
know
anything
about
the
second
spring
of
course
he
lost
his
money
i
did
not
have
any
use
for
such
contrivances
as
old
monte
was
good
enough
for
me
but
i
always
tried
to
keep
posted
on
all
the
tricks
and
schemes
so
as
to
be
able
to
down
the
schemers
at
their
own
games
bill
and
i
went
on
board
the
steamer
bound
for
new
orleans
late
one
night
i
was
tired
and
sleepy
so
i
told
bill
i
would
go
to
bed
he
said
he
would
take
a
smoke
and
then
join
me
i
had
not
been
in
bed
but
a
few
moments
when
a
black
boy
called
me
and
said
that
my
partner
was
in
trouble
in
the
barber
shop
i
was
up
and
into
my
pants
in
a
moment
i
grabbed
old
betsy
jane
and
started
when
i
arrived
at
the
shop
door
i
saw
two
fellows
standing
over
bill
one
had
a
big
the
other
had
a
poker
i
did
not
stop
to
inquire
what
the
trouble
was
about
but
rushed
in
struck
the
fellow
with
the
knife
and
as
the
fellow
with
the
poker
started
to
run
i
let
him
have
one
and
they
both
measured
their
lengths
on
the
floor
i
turned
to
ask
bill
what
the
d
the
fellows
were
after
him
for
when
they
both
jumped
up
and
lit
out
bill
said
well
george
i
tell
you
them
fellows
took
me
for
a
sucker
and
bet
me
that
i
could
open
a
big
knife
they
had
but
george
i
knew
how
to
open
her
just
as
well
as
they
did
and
i
won
their
money
they
wanted
me
to
give
it
up
but
when
i
saw
the
black
boy
start
after
you
i
thought
i
would
hold
on
until
you
came
then
i
knew
they
would
get
left
did
i
george
yes
bill
you
bet
you
wo
have
to
give
up
when
i
around
george
them
fellows
took
me
for
a
sucker
do
i
look
like
a
sucker
no
bill
you
look
like
a
nice
smart
i
replied
bill
laughed
and
said
george
i
better
off
than
i
would
have
been
if
you
had
not
got
here
just
in
time
let
take
something
and
then
go
to
bed
the
fellow
dropped
his
big
knife
which
we
found
on
the
floor
so
that
he
was
out
and
his
knife
by
tackling
not
a
sucker
but
one
of
the
oldest
and
best
in
the
country
on
the
shell
road
during
the
war
after
ben
butler
took
possession
of
new
orleans
the
city
was
always
full
of
union
officers
and
soldiers
money
was
very
plentiful
and
of
course
everything
was
lively
i
was
running
the
and
gambling
games
out
at
the
lake
and
was
making
big
money
i
had
nineteen
good
horses
some
were
trotters
some
pacers
and
some
runners
i
would
drive
out
and
in
over
the
shell
road
which
at
that
time
was
one
of
the
finest
drives
in
this
country
i
did
not
allow
any
one
to
have
a
faster
horse
than
myself
and
generally
drove
a
pacer
as
the
road
was
very
hard
and
would
stove
up
a
trotter
in
a
short
time
i
had
a
very
pretty
bay
mare
that
could
pace
in
every
day
in
the
week
and
she
had
beaten
fourteen
other
horses
at
the
state
fair
in
i
drove
emma
devol
the
bay
mare
most
of
the
time
i
had
a
big
black
horse
called
the
duke
of
orleans
which
was
faster
than
emma
devol
but
i
hardly
ever
drove
him
on
the
shell
road
as
i
kept
him
for
the
i
was
driving
the
duke
out
on
the
road
one
evening
when
i
overtook
a
big
fellow
by
the
name
of
jim
dueane
who
was
a
lieutenant
of
police
at
that
time
he
was
a
good
clever
fellow
when
sober
but
very
quarrelsome
when
drunk
he
was
driving
a
good
horse
and
i
could
see
he
was
under
the
influence
of
liquor
he
asked
me
where
i
got
the
plug
i
was
driving
for
he
did
not
recognize
the
duke
i
told
him
it
was
an
old
fellow
i
had
bought
for
to
drive
on
the
road
as
i
did
not
want
to
stove
up
my
we
were
about
two
miles
from
the
lake
when
he
offered
to
bet
me
a
bottle
of
wine
he
could
beat
me
to
the
lake
i
took
him
up
and
we
started
i
let
him
get
a
little
ahead
so
i
could
see
how
his
horse
moved
we
were
going
along
in
this
way
for
the
first
mile
when
he
looked
back
and
said
come
on
devol
or
you
will
have
to
pay
for
the
wine
i
replied
all
right
i
will
do
it
as
i
do
not
want
to
lose
the
bet
i
gave
duke
the
word
and
he
got
right
down
to
business
and
passed
dueane
so
quick
that
he
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
the
old
plug
after
i
got
about
feet
ahead
of
him
i
looked
back
and
told
him
to
come
on
or
he
would
have
to
pay
for
the
wine
he
tried
very
hard
to
catch
me
but
it
was
no
use
as
duke
was
not
that
kind
of
a
horse
i
was
at
the
lake
out
of
my
wagon
and
had
the
blanket
on
the
duke
of
orleans
when
dueane
drove
up
i
could
see
that
he
was
not
in
good
humor
he
got
and
hitched
his
horse
and
then
we
walked
over
to
the
hotel
to
get
the
bottle
of
wine
i
began
laughing
at
him
and
wanted
to
know
what
he
thought
of
the
duke
as
a
plug
when
he
let
drive
at
me
i
ducked
my
head
and
he
hit
it
a
pretty
hard
lick
i
started
for
him
but
some
of
the
officers
jumped
in
between
us
and
put
a
stop
to
the
fight
and
in
a
little
while
he
apologized
and
we
were
drinking
together
i
could
have
whipped
him
for
i
was
in
my
prime
at
that
time
but
i
was
glad
they
separated
us
as
i
did
not
want
to
have
any
trouble
with
the
police
while
we
were
drinking
and
talking
about
the
race
a
great
big
colonel
of
a
new
york
regiment
who
was
pretty
drunk
spoke
up
and
said
i
can
whip
any
man
that
will
do
anything
to
dueane
i
knew
he
had
reference
to
me
but
the
room
was
full
of
strapped
fellows
and
i
did
not
want
any
of
his
chicken
pie
just
then
so
i
paid
no
attention
to
his
remarks
he
kept
on
with
his
abuse
and
i
was
just
itching
to
get
at
him
but
knew
i
would
not
stand
a
fair
show
unless
some
of
my
friends
should
drop
in
which
i
expected
they
would
do
before
long
as
it
was
a
little
early
for
the
town
boys
in
a
short
time
a
friend
of
mine
by
the
name
of
joe
summers
and
a
crowd
of
new
orleans
boys
came
in
then
i
knew
i
would
have
a
fair
show
so
i
walked
up
to
the
big
colonel
and
said
you
are
a
big
lubber
and
ca
fight
just
a
little
bit
up
went
his
hands
but
before
he
could
lead
off
i
gave
him
one
under
the
chin
and
he
measured
his
length
on
the
floor
my
friends
were
all
around
us
in
an
instant
and
joe
summers
said
that
it
should
be
a
fair
fight
i
was
ready
to
give
him
my
head
when
he
got
up
but
the
big
lubber
said
that
will
do
in
ten
minutes
after
i
knocked
him
down
we
were
drinking
wine
together
and
no
one
would
have
though
we
ever
had
a
difficulty
he
was
so
big
that
he
thought
he
could
bluff
me
but
he
did
not
know
that
i
was
about
the
worst
man
in
that
part
of
the
country
at
that
time
to
bluff
at
any
game
more
especially
at
the
game
of
fight
for
i
would
rather
have
fought
than
not
and
i
did
not
think
there
was
a
man
living
in
those
days
that
could
whip
me
in
a
we
had
several
bottles
of
wine
on
the
strength
of
our
little
misunderstanding
the
result
was
we
were
all
feeling
pretty
good
and
liberal
and
i
do
believe
we
opened
bottles
of
wine
before
there
were
about
teams
hitched
around
the
hotel
and
i
knew
when
their
owners
started
home
they
would
get
to
racing
on
the
shell
road
and
some
of
the
horses
and
buggies
would
get
hurt
so
i
told
a
to
put
my
horse
up
and
i
would
wait
until
morning
a
few
of
the
others
did
the
same
thing
but
the
balance
started
and
some
of
them
were
so
drunk
that
they
could
not
see
the
road
although
it
was
as
white
as
marble
the
next
morning
after
i
had
eaten
my
breakfast
i
had
my
team
brought
out
and
started
for
the
city
the
wine
of
the
night
previous
had
done
its
work
for
i
saw
seven
buggies
or
parts
of
them
strewn
along
the
road
dueane
had
run
into
the
and
came
near
killing
himself
and
his
horse
wine
is
a
great
worker
when
one
gets
too
much
of
it
inside
it
gave
employment
to
the
and
put
me
to
bed
on
that
occasion
and
i
was
glad
of
it
when
i
saw
the
wrecks
it
had
made
of
my
boon
companions
of
the
night
before
a
mile
dash
about
the
time
referred
to
in
the
preceding
story
the
livery
business
was
very
good
in
new
orleans
and
some
of
the
kept
quite
fast
horses
which
they
would
let
out
to
persons
they
knew
would
not
abuse
them
my
old
friend
dick
barnum
was
running
a
stable
in
those
days
and
is
in
the
same
business
but
he
is
getting
old
now
like
myself
and
i
suppose
he
goes
to
church
regularly
every
sunday
instead
of
going
out
to
the
as
he
and
i
did
years
ago
i
was
at
dick
stable
one
day
when
he
was
feeling
pretty
good
and
he
began
bragging
on
a
horse
that
he
had
and
which
he
called
tom
parker
i
let
him
blow
for
some
time
when
i
said
to
him
dick
you
do
weigh
more
than
pounds
and
i
weigh
over
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
hitch
my
black
horse
to
a
skeleton
wagon
and
put
on
a
bag
of
sand
weighing
pounds
you
can
hitch
tom
to
a
sulky
and
we
will
drive
our
own
horses
and
i
will
bet
you
that
i
can
beat
you
one
dash
of
a
mile
around
the
track
he
said
put
her
up
we
put
up
the
money
in
johnnie
hawkins
hands
and
agreed
to
pace
that
afternoon
the
news
of
the
race
spread
rapidly
and
there
was
a
large
crowd
at
the
course
to
see
the
sport
henry
foley
was
in
the
judge
stand
and
we
were
all
ready
the
bets
were
about
even
although
my
horse
was
handicapped
with
four
wheels
to
sulky
and
besides
i
had
pounds
to
his
we
tossed
up
for
the
pole
and
dick
won
we
went
up
the
stretch
and
came
down
for
the
tap
but
dick
wanted
the
best
of
it
and
was
about
ten
lengths
ahead
when
he
went
under
the
wire
i
nodded
to
henry
so
he
let
us
go
dick
went
flying
from
the
start
and
i
eased
my
horse
around
the
first
turn
so
that
when
i
got
straightened
up
on
the
back
stretch
dick
was
yards
ahead
the
betting
was
then
to
in
favor
of
dick
as
they
all
thought
that
i
could
never
close
up
that
big
gap
i
gave
old
duke
one
cut
across
the
back
and
he
went
down
that
stretch
like
a
sure
enough
we
came
around
the
next
turn
and
when
i
got
square
into
the
home
stretch
i
gave
the
horse
a
and
we
went
past
dick
so
fast
that
he
thought
he
was
tied
to
the
fence
i
went
under
the
wire
about
ten
lengths
ahead
of
dick
and
the
fellows
that
had
taken
some
of
the
to
bets
raised
the
yell
and
kept
it
up
until
you
would
have
thought
they
were
a
pack
of
wild
indians
my
friend
johnnie
hawkins
took
all
the
bets
that
he
could
get
in
that
short
time
dick
did
not
blow
about
tom
parker
any
more
after
that
and
when
i
would
ask
him
if
he
wanted
another
race
he
would
say
no
george
i
would
rather
take
a
drink
and
that
was
about
all
i
was
ever
able
to
get
out
of
him
i
hope
to
see
the
old
fellow
alive
and
happy
the
next
time
i
visit
new
orleans
for
he
is
a
good
clever
fellow
and
i
hope
he
will
live
as
long
as
i
do
and
i
expect
to
live
forever
mule
thieves
during
the
time
i
was
running
the
and
my
games
at
the
lake
i
was
taken
down
with
the
yellow
fever
and
was
confined
to
my
bed
for
about
twenty
days
i
was
about
well
and
had
been
sitting
up
for
a
few
days
when
my
and
a
friend
of
mine
by
the
name
of
george
leonard
called
to
see
me
and
as
i
was
feeling
so
much
better
they
wanted
me
to
go
out
to
the
track
and
time
one
of
my
pacing
horses
with
a
running
mate
so
i
muffled
myself
up
in
a
big
overcoat
and
went
out
i
sat
in
the
buggy
and
held
the
watch
but
when
they
came
to
ask
me
what
time
had
been
made
i
was
lying
in
the
bottom
of
the
buggy
they
took
me
back
to
my
room
and
i
was
just
as
sick
as
i
had
been
any
time
during
the
fever
i
had
the
best
physician
in
new
orleans
and
he
said
after
i
was
out
of
danger
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
iron
constitution
he
could
not
have
pulled
me
through
i
felt
the
effects
of
my
last
attack
with
for
two
years
afterward
and
i
am
not
afraid
of
it
a
short
time
after
getting
well
of
the
fever
i
was
at
the
livery
stable
early
one
morning
where
i
kept
some
of
my
horses
the
stable
was
owned
by
my
friends
william
and
george
leonard
and
they
were
large
dealers
in
horses
and
mules
when
i
arrived
the
boys
were
for
they
had
sold
twenty
head
of
good
mules
to
some
fellows
the
evening
before
and
had
allowed
them
to
put
the
mules
on
board
of
a
little
boat
lying
at
the
landing
on
the
promise
that
they
would
pay
the
money
as
soon
as
the
bank
opened
the
next
day
the
boys
had
been
down
to
the
landing
and
had
found
that
the
boat
and
mules
were
gone
they
wanted
me
to
go
with
them
and
catch
the
thieves
so
we
armed
ourselves
with
pistols
and
shotguns
took
a
fast
packet
and
started
about
forty
miles
above
the
city
we
saw
the
little
boat
lying
at
the
levee
but
as
we
passed
it
could
be
seen
that
there
were
no
mules
on
board
we
went
up
about
a
mile
and
then
got
off
and
started
back
when
we
got
near
the
little
boat
we
saw
the
mules
in
a
pasture
we
let
down
the
fence
and
started
to
drive
them
out
when
the
fellows
saw
us
and
came
off
to
stop
us
i
told
the
boys
to
take
the
mules
and
i
would
take
care
of
the
d
d
thieves
they
were
coming
with
their
guns
out
i
pulled
my
shotgun
down
on
them
and
told
them
to
halt
which
they
did
when
the
boys
got
the
mules
on
the
run
up
the
levee
i
followed
them
and
the
thieves
followed
me
they
ran
us
up
into
a
little
town
when
they
got
out
a
replevy
and
took
the
mules
we
had
a
trial
and
won
the
case
so
we
put
our
mules
on
a
boat
and
were
soon
back
in
new
orleans
the
leonard
boys
get
the
money
now
before
they
let
the
stock
go
aboard
a
boat
an
honorable
man
some
men
are
the
soul
of
honor
and
if
they
lose
a
bet
will
walk
right
up
to
the
captain
office
and
settle
while
others
are
fast
enough
to
make
bets
take
chances
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
when
it
comes
to
paying
their
losses
if
there
is
a
hole
to
crawl
out
of
they
are
the
very
men
to
do
it
coming
out
of
new
orleans
one
time
on
the
steamer
i
was
open
for
business
waiting
for
somebody
to
try
his
luck
when
looking
around
i
espied
one
of
the
leading
dry
good
merchants
of
the
crescent
city
whose
place
of
business
was
on
canal
street
he
asked
me
the
kind
of
game
i
was
running
and
i
explained
it
to
him
when
my
capper
came
along
and
looking
on
made
a
bet
for
the
drinks
that
he
could
turn
the
jack
the
capper
won
and
we
had
the
drinks
all
around
when
he
took
the
jack
and
turned
up
a
corner
taking
care
to
let
the
merchant
see
what
he
had
done
then
he
began
bantering
me
to
bet
with
him
i
persisted
that
i
had
the
best
of
it
as
i
had
two
chances
to
his
one
and
was
dead
sure
to
win
two
out
of
three
times
the
merchant
had
often
seen
me
playing
short
cards
and
rouge
et
noir
we
kept
up
a
running
conversation
for
some
time
till
at
last
i
told
him
that
i
had
never
run
a
game
i
would
not
bet
on
except
this
one
then
the
capper
offered
to
wager
that
he
could
turn
the
right
card
put
up
your
money
was
all
i
said
and
i
handed
mine
to
the
merchant
sure
enough
he
turned
the
right
card
and
i
unconcernedly
remarked
well
you
got
her
then
the
merchant
wanted
to
bet
me
that
he
could
turn
the
right
card
when
i
replied
i
will
make
just
one
bet
with
you
for
he
began
going
through
his
pockets
and
only
found
so
i
said
i
back
out
as
i
do
not
know
much
about
the
game
anyhow
but
if
there
is
any
other
game
you
want
to
be
on
why
i
am
your
man
continuing
i
said
any
other
game
but
this
one
i
will
bet
on
i
pride
myself
on
betting
as
big
as
anybody
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
knew
of
your
backing
out
replied
the
merchant
the
capper
then
offered
to
bet
and
began
to
abuse
me
he
put
up
his
money
guessed
the
right
card
and
of
course
won
things
were
now
getting
exciting
and
my
merchant
friend
was
very
warm
under
the
collar
and
wanted
to
bet
me
the
but
i
have
it
and
said
in
a
majestic
manner
no
sir
nothing
less
than
a
cool
thousand
as
i
am
now
a
big
loser
the
capper
offered
to
loan
the
merchant
some
money
to
make
up
the
balance
but
i
would
not
allow
it
at
last
he
put
up
his
watch
and
diamond
pin
and
went
to
turn
the
jack
of
course
he
lost
afterwards
he
came
to
me
and
gave
me
a
check
for
and
i
returned
him
his
jewelry
and
money
we
stopped
for
half
an
hour
at
one
of
the
landings
and
he
slipped
off
and
countermanded
the
payment
of
the
check
by
telegraph
when
i
presented
the
check
at
the
bank
i
was
shown
the
dispatch
and
to
this
day
the
check
has
never
been
paid
though
the
merchant
still
does
business
on
canal
street
he
was
an
honorable
merchant
my
partner
won
dunlap
and
i
got
on
the
steamer
one
evening
at
baton
rouge
and
seeing
no
one
of
board
that
i
thought
was
of
any
particular
service
to
me
i
got
a
bottle
of
wine
and
a
good
cigar
and
was
sitting
in
the
hall
when
a
coal
merchant
whom
i
knew
very
well
in
baton
rouge
came
along
and
seeing
me
said
devol
this
is
rather
a
slim
trip
for
your
business
laughingly
i
replied
yes
but
that
do
hinder
us
from
taking
a
drink
together
does
it
i
have
just
had
one
thank
you
he
insisted
and
i
did
not
hang
back
so
after
smoking
we
sat
down
near
the
bar
when
he
remarked
that
this
was
the
first
boat
he
ever
was
on
where
they
did
have
a
game
of
poker
i
thought
myself
it
was
something
strange
as
in
those
days
everybody
played
cards
at
last
we
got
to
throwing
for
the
drinks
when
he
finally
remarked
that
if
there
were
one
or
two
more
around
we
might
have
a
good
game
of
poker
though
i
said
i
did
care
to
play
as
i
was
sleepy
yet
he
persisted
along
came
dunlap
whom
he
did
not
know
and
i
asked
him
if
he
ever
played
poker
he
replied
a
little
when
he
was
at
home
in
illinois
come
on
then
and
take
a
drink
said
the
coal
man
i
gave
dunlap
the
wink
and
excusing
himself
for
a
moment
he
went
to
his
room
and
procuring
a
pack
of
marked
cards
gave
them
to
the
barkeeper
when
he
came
in
the
coal
man
at
once
began
sit
down
and
we
make
up
a
game
then
dunlap
asked
the
barkeeper
for
some
cards
and
of
course
the
marked
pack
was
handed
out
it
was
then
we
started
in
at
a
limit
and
played
until
the
table
was
needed
for
breakfast
the
coal
man
and
myself
were
both
losers
he
said
he
lost
i
lost
but
as
i
lost
it
to
my
partner
i
was
not
haunted
one
night
anxious
to
reach
new
orleans
i
took
a
boat
out
of
wichita
and
as
it
was
late
the
clerk
said
the
only
berth
he
could
give
me
was
in
a
with
another
man
i
crawled
into
the
top
berth
and
towards
morning
i
was
awakened
by
a
noise
beneath
me
carefully
looking
over
the
berth
i
spied
the
occupant
of
the
lower
berth
with
a
long
colt
navy
revolver
in
his
hand
his
hair
was
disheveled
and
his
eye
was
wild
while
his
actions
indicated
that
he
was
hunting
for
somebody
i
lay
very
quiet
however
thinking
that
he
was
either
a
victim
of
delirium
tremens
or
a
lunatic
at
last
he
arose
and
opened
the
door
and
went
into
the
cabin
the
only
occupants
of
which
were
the
porter
and
the
watchman
they
lost
no
time
in
leaving
when
they
saw
a
man
clad
only
in
a
and
drawers
with
a
drawn
revolver
in
his
hand
i
arose
and
dressed
as
i
had
had
enough
of
such
a
and
on
telling
the
clerk
of
the
facts
he
said
that
strange
for
i
knew
the
man
very
well
he
never
drinks
but
he
has
killed
three
men
that
settled
it
with
me
he
was
haunted
by
the
ghosts
of
his
murdered
victims
mccoole
and
coburn
when
the
mccoole
and
coburn
fight
came
on
i
left
new
orleans
for
the
purpose
of
witnessing
the
sport
on
reaching
cincinnati
john
franklin
invited
me
to
go
over
to
latonia
springs
and
see
coburn
i
did
so
and
spent
a
pleasant
afternoon
with
him
he
invited
me
to
come
over
and
keep
him
company
and
as
i
thought
i
could
turn
an
honest
penny
as
well
as
have
a
little
recreation
i
packed
up
my
faro
tools
and
went
into
the
dark
and
bloody
ground
back
of
covington
when
any
strangers
came
along
i
opened
up
and
caught
all
that
was
in
sight
as
the
time
for
the
fight
drew
near
a
number
of
coburn
friends
came
on
from
new
york
they
were
glad
to
see
him
in
such
good
heart
and
spirits
they
came
with
a
good
deal
of
money
to
back
him
up
and
as
the
boys
had
to
do
something
to
while
away
the
weary
hours
joe
introduced
them
to
my
partner
saying
that
he
was
a
new
orleans
gentleman
who
had
come
on
to
aid
me
in
money
matters
joe
called
him
a
planter
and
the
new
yorkers
were
so
pleased
with
him
that
they
invited
him
into
a
game
of
poker
the
result
was
that
he
did
them
up
for
a
few
hundred
and
one
of
the
party
who
was
an
old
faro
dealer
secured
a
few
of
the
cards
examined
them
in
another
room
and
coming
back
observed
count
me
out
of
this
game
i
do
want
any
more
of
it
that
broke
things
all
up
and
the
next
day
they
began
on
coburn
and
gave
him
a
terrible
cursing
for
steering
them
against
such
a
game
as
that
when
they
came
on
with
good
intentions
to
back
him
in
the
fight
they
never
said
anything
however
to
hoy
as
they
knew
he
was
always
looking
for
the
best
of
every
game
and
was
as
ready
to
fleece
a
friend
as
a
foe
when
we
were
going
down
to
cold
spring
i
opened
up
on
the
cars
and
won
a
little
money
just
then
a
man
stepped
up
and
began
to
get
out
his
money
when
elliott
and
his
gang
rushed
in
picked
up
the
fellow
and
threw
him
up
against
the
top
of
the
car
when
he
came
down
he
did
have
a
cent
i
was
amused
to
see
him
hunt
around
for
his
money
when
we
reached
the
ground
i
opened
out
having
a
negro
to
hold
the
stand
for
me
at
last
as
the
crowd
began
to
rush
for
the
ring
i
told
hoy
that
i
would
go
and
see
the
fun
so
i
handed
hoy
all
my
money
except
a
lot
of
broken
that
i
had
this
i
rolled
in
a
large
wad
and
placed
conspicuously
in
a
side
coat
pocket
i
noticed
as
i
edged
close
up
to
the
ring
that
i
was
closely
eyed
by
the
thieves
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
book
disappeared
then
i
made
a
terrible
squeal
and
when
the
reporters
came
around
i
gave
out
that
i
had
been
robbed
of
the
next
day
the
papers
all
had
an
account
of
the
robbery
of
devol
of
new
orleans
hazen
at
last
found
my
which
was
worth
more
than
the
money
it
contained
and
had
a
good
advertisement
free
salted
down
if
the
old
saying
every
man
has
his
price
be
true
then
every
man
can
be
caught
on
some
scheme
or
trick
there
are
persons
who
have
never
made
a
bet
of
any
kind
in
their
lives
that
would
do
so
if
they
saw
something
that
they
knew
to
be
a
sure
winner
then
there
are
others
who
will
bet
on
many
things
but
they
pride
themselves
on
being
too
smart
to
bet
on
any
man
trick
and
the
more
they
see
others
doing
so
the
more
sanguine
they
are
that
no
one
could
ever
catch
them
with
chaff
i
have
met
many
of
the
latter
class
and
always
tried
to
down
them
they
of
course
would
not
bit
at
the
monte
bait
for
it
was
too
stale
for
them
so
i
would
study
sometimes
for
hours
how
to
take
the
conceit
out
of
them
i
remember
being
on
board
the
steamer
coming
out
of
new
orleans
at
one
time
just
after
the
mardi
gras
festival
the
boat
was
crowded
with
passengers
and
we
were
having
a
very
lively
game
of
monte
when
a
fellow
from
the
red
river
country
named
picket
came
up
to
the
table
and
began
pulling
he
was
one
of
those
smart
alecks
who
knew
all
the
tricks
or
at
least
he
thought
he
did
and
he
imagined
that
it
was
his
especial
duty
to
warn
others
of
their
danger
if
he
could
not
stop
them
with
a
tail
pull
he
would
tell
them
not
to
bet
as
i
was
a
regular
gambler
and
would
win
their
money
sure
when
they
thought
the
sure
thing
was
in
their
favor
and
some
of
them
would
not
heed
his
warning
but
put
down
their
money
and
of
course
lose
it
i
put
up
with
picket
interference
for
some
time
and
then
i
put
up
my
cards
resolving
to
down
the
red
river
man
if
it
lay
in
my
power
i
invited
all
hands
to
join
me
in
a
drink
and
then
excused
myself
saying
i
suffering
with
the
toothache
and
will
go
to
my
room
in
a
short
time
i
returned
and
took
a
seat
in
the
hall
near
the
stove
as
it
was
quite
chilly
picket
and
a
number
of
other
gentlemen
were
seated
around
and
we
soon
got
to
telling
stories
my
tooth
ached
so
badly
that
i
could
not
enjoy
the
stories
and
was
constantly
complaining
of
the
pain
a
great
many
remedies
were
suggested
but
they
could
not
be
had
on
the
boat
finally
the
barkeeper
recommended
hot
salt
held
on
the
side
of
the
face
i
asked
him
if
he
had
any
he
said
no
but
i
could
get
it
in
the
pantry
i
got
up
and
went
for
the
salt
i
returned
in
a
short
time
with
a
package
of
salt
about
the
size
of
a
goose
egg
which
was
twisted
up
in
a
piece
of
paper
i
put
it
on
the
stove
and
when
it
got
hot
i
held
it
to
my
face
until
it
cooled
off
then
i
put
it
back
on
the
stove
while
the
salt
was
getting
hot
a
second
time
i
went
to
my
room
to
get
something
the
barkeeper
said
to
the
crowd
let
have
some
fun
with
devol
so
saying
he
opened
the
package
threw
out
the
salt
and
filled
up
the
paper
with
ashes
i
came
back
picked
up
my
salt
and
held
it
to
my
face
picket
asked
me
if
it
was
doing
my
tooth
any
good
i
told
him
i
thought
it
was
then
they
all
laughed
at
the
idea
of
hot
salt
being
good
for
the
toothache
and
picket
said
devol
do
you
know
that
when
salt
gets
hot
it
will
turn
into
ashes
no
i
do
what
do
you
take
me
for
you
must
have
been
drinking
i
replied
they
all
laughed
again
and
picket
spoke
up
saying
i
do
believe
you
have
any
salt
in
that
paper
i
set
the
package
on
the
stove
again
and
replied
you
must
take
me
for
a
d
d
fool
sure
enough
but
you
look
like
you
had
any
more
sense
than
the
law
allows
i
got
that
salt
out
of
the
and
i
tasted
it
before
i
wrapped
it
up
and
i
know
it
is
salt
and
that
settles
it
but
devol
salt
does
turn
to
ashes
when
it
is
hot
and
i
will
bet
you
the
drinks
for
the
crowd
that
there
is
no
salt
in
that
paper
on
the
stove
then
they
had
another
big
laugh
at
my
expense
and
i
got
mad
i
jumped
up
and
said
i
will
bet
you
that
there
is
nothing
in
that
paper
but
salt
picket
jumped
up
also
saying
i
will
just
go
you
once
anyway
i
put
up
my
with
the
barkeeper
but
picket
did
not
have
but
and
he
wanted
to
bet
that
i
told
him
he
could
back
out
but
i
would
not
bet
less
than
what
i
had
up
then
he
put
up
his
watch
and
chain
for
the
other
one
of
the
men
that
had
been
enjoying
the
fun
said
i
will
bet
you
that
picket
wins
the
money
i
replied
i
will
not
bet
less
than
then
picket
said
he
wants
to
bluff
you
out
but
he
ca
bluff
me
worth
a
cent
so
the
man
put
up
his
and
i
covered
it
everybody
was
excited
and
some
of
my
friends
who
had
seen
the
trick
that
was
being
played
on
me
told
me
not
to
bet
but
i
was
mad
and
would
not
listen
to
them
when
all
was
ready
the
package
was
taken
off
the
stove
and
handed
to
the
barkeeper
he
untwisted
the
paper
and
spread
it
out
on
the
counter
and
in
it
was
as
nice
fine
white
salt
as
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
the
barkeeper
tasted
some
of
it
just
as
i
did
when
i
put
up
the
papers
alike
and
then
handed
me
over
the
money
and
picket
watch
and
chain
red
river
took
a
large
pinch
of
the
bait
and
it
or
the
loss
of
his
money
and
watch
came
near
strangling
him
he
did
not
entirely
recover
from
the
effect
while
he
remained
on
the
boat
for
every
time
he
was
well
enough
to
come
out
of
his
room
some
one
would
say
salt
and
that
would
make
him
sick
again
i
have
caught
a
great
many
suckers
in
my
time
but
picket
was
the
first
one
i
ever
salted
down
the
arkansas
killers
for
many
years
i
almost
lived
on
board
the
packets
i
felt
more
at
home
on
any
of
the
mississippi
steamboats
than
i
did
on
land
in
any
city
or
town
in
the
united
states
i
had
friends
wherever
i
went
and
i
knew
every
officer
and
many
of
the
crew
on
nearly
every
boat
that
ran
the
river
while
on
water
i
did
not
fear
any
man
or
set
of
men
but
there
were
localities
on
land
along
the
mississippi
river
that
no
man
could
hold
his
own
with
the
rough
element
that
lived
around
them
so
i
always
gave
such
places
a
wide
berth
helena
and
napoleon
were
two
towns
where
it
was
not
safe
for
any
man
to
do
the
bluff
act
for
they
would
kill
him
just
to
see
him
kick
i
won
some
money
from
one
of
helena
killers
at
one
time
on
board
a
steamer
and
he
set
up
a
big
kick
but
as
he
was
alone
he
was
like
all
men
of
his
class
a
coward
i
well
knew
that
if
he
caught
me
on
his
ground
i
would
get
the
worst
of
it
so
i
resolved
never
to
give
him
a
chance
but
one
evening
i
was
compelled
to
get
off
at
helena
as
things
had
gotten
a
little
too
warm
for
me
on
board
the
boat
and
i
thought
i
would
run
the
risk
of
the
killers
rather
than
give
up
the
money
i
had
won
at
that
time
i
went
up
to
the
hotel
to
get
my
supper
and
wait
for
another
boat
and
one
of
the
first
men
i
met
was
the
fellow
i
had
beaten
out
of
his
money
i
knew
there
would
be
trouble
so
i
put
betsy
jane
in
a
handy
place
resolving
to
use
her
for
what
she
was
worth
if
the
killers
got
after
me
i
did
not
leave
the
hotel
until
the
boat
arrived
and
just
about
the
time
i
was
starting
out
the
clerk
told
me
that
some
of
the
gamblers
had
beaten
one
of
the
worst
men
in
the
country
on
a
boat
and
he
was
down
at
the
landing
with
a
crowd
of
his
roughs
waiting
to
do
him
up
there
was
a
lot
of
persons
waiting
for
the
same
boat
among
them
some
gamblers
i
told
the
clerk
to
send
for
a
carriage
and
i
would
not
go
down
until
just
as
the
boat
was
about
to
leave
all
the
others
left
the
hotel
and
started
for
the
landing
before
the
boat
came
in
the
killers
jumped
on
the
poor
gamblers
supposing
of
course
that
i
was
among
them
they
beat
them
up
fearfully
and
came
near
killing
one
of
them
during
the
excitement
i
was
driven
to
the
plank
and
jumped
out
and
was
on
board
before
any
one
recognized
me
when
the
killers
learned
that
i
had
given
them
the
slip
they
were
determined
to
board
the
boat
and
get
me
but
the
mate
got
his
crew
on
the
guards
and
would
not
let
any
of
them
on
board
the
boat
backed
out
at
once
and
i
was
again
at
home
among
my
friends
and
you
can
bet
i
was
glad
of
it
for
i
think
that
was
one
of
my
close
calls
cheap
jewelry
before
the
war
there
was
hardly
a
boat
of
any
size
that
plied
up
and
down
the
mississippi
and
its
tributaries
that
did
not
count
among
its
travelers
or
passengers
some
peddler
with
his
pack
for
the
most
part
his
stock
in
trade
consisted
of
cheap
jewelry
gilded
galvanized
watches
plated
chains
various
notions
and
unassortable
sometimes
these
peddlers
carried
along
a
wheel
and
had
the
things
marked
with
numbers
corresponding
to
those
on
the
wheel
the
charge
was
a
dollar
a
spin
and
at
whatever
number
the
wheel
stopped
the
article
corresponding
belonged
to
the
investor
in
the
game
captain
dix
was
then
in
command
of
the
a
packet
running
from
new
orleans
to
louis
one
evening

dix

i
have
got
one
of
those
infernal
wheel
peddling
chaps
aboard
and
he
has
been
annoying
the
life
out
of
me
i
driven
him
out
of
the
cabin
and
he
has
taken
refuge
in
the
barber
shop
i
wish
you
could
take
him
in
strolling
down
towards
the
barber
shop
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
fellow
and
being
satisfied
that
he
did
not
know
me
i
watched
his
game
for
some
time
and
then
ran
against
it
worth
that
a
heap
fairer
game
than
i
lost
at
i
said
to
the
owner
what
game
was
that
he
curiously
asked
the
fellow
called
it
rocky
mountain
euchre
i
go
and
get
you
some
of
the
tickets
and
show
everybody
how
the
fellow
chiseled
me
out
of
my
money
oh
that
monte
said
the
wheel
man
alexander
was
along
with
me
so
i
began
throwing
the
cards
around
awkwardly
when
my
partner
stepped
up
to
the
table
and
began
guessing
for
fun
finally
he
bent
one
of
the
corners
and
showed
it
to
the
wheelman
whispering
to
him
let
have
a
little
fun
out
of
the
old
fellow
aleck
told
me
to
mix
up
and
offered
to
bet
the
drinks
that
he
could
turn
up
the
old
woman
i
got
two
chances
to
your
one
i
replied
but
i
go
yer
he
turned
the
wrong
one
and
i
laughed
as
did
the
wheel
man
aleck
then
began
blackguarding
me
saying
that
i
dare
not
bet
on
it
that
he
did
not
believe
i
had
any
money
till
at
last
i
pulled
out
a
bundle
that
made
the
wheel
man
look
wild
aleck
kept
on
daring
me
so
at
last
i
bet
him
that
he
could
find
it
the
first
time
after
i
had
done
mixing
them
then
he
made
the
bet
putting
the
money
up
in
the
wheelman
hands
and
sure
enough
he
turned
the
old
woman
then
i
offered
to
bet
him
again
for
and
he
turned
it
a
second
time
then
i
pretended
to
drop
on
him
and
refused
to
bet
saying
that
his
eyesight
was
too
fine
but
he
offered
to
bet
me
that
the
wheel
man
could
do
it
i
replied
that
i
bet
any
amount
that
he
could
unless
he
told
him
how
this
settled
the
wheelman
who
said
that
he
could
turn
the
right
card
for
but
i
am
already
a
loser
for
more
than
that
and
i
wo
bet
now
for
less
than
he
began
counting
out
his
roll
but
could
only
make
out
he
was
wearing
a
watch
and
chain
and
aleck
whispered
to
him
to
put
up
that
for
the
remaining
this
he
did
and
i
soon
raked
them
in
as
of
course
he
got
the
wrong
card
the
fellow
looked
a
little
blue
but
aleck
made
him
believe
that
he
had
in
his
hurry
picked
up
the
wrong
card
so
the
fellow
was
bound
to
have
revenge
and
he
put
up
his
jewelry
and
wheel
all
of
which
i
soon
won
when
captain
dix
came
around
he
was
so
overjoyed
that
he
set
up
the
wine
and
had
a
hearty
laugh
over
it
i
gave
the
fellow
and
paid
his
passage
back
to
louis
while
his
jewelry
i
gave
to
a
lame
fellow
that
i
knew
in
new
orleans
and
it
was
a
start
in
life
for
him
the
next
morning
before
the
story
of
the
jewelry
man
had
gotten
out
among
the
passengers
we
took
in
two
or
three
suckers
and
were
intending
to
get
off
at
baton
rouge
but
noticing
several
good
men
getting
aboard
determined
to
try
our
hands
on
them
the
fates
were
propitious
for
we
won
and
a
watch
from
one
of
them
and
the
other
was
plucked
for
and
a
diamond
pin
i
afterwards
learned
that
they
were
both
wealthy
men
who
had
been
up
to
see
the
governor
so
the
trifling
loss
of
their
pocket
money
did
not
affect
them
won
and
lost
we
had
been
playing
monte
at
one
time
in
the
of
the
old
prentis
house
at
vicksburg
and
had
just
closed
up
when
in
came
four
fellows
that
lived
back
in
the
country
we
thought
they
had
some
money
so
we
opened
up
again
to
take
it
in
it
was
not
long
until
we
had
all
of
their
cash
stuff
then
one
of
them
pointed
out
a
fine
horse
that
was
hitched
with
three
others
out
at
the
rack
and
wanted
to
bet
me
the
horse
against
the
others
then
said
they
would
do
the
same
thing
so
i
put
up
against
their
four
horses
and
they
selected
one
of
their
party
to
turn
the
card
he
turned
and
lost
i
sent
a
black
boy
to
put
my
horses
into
the
stable
and
he
started
with
two
of
them
when
two
of
the
fellows
rushed
out
jumped
onto
the
other
two
horses
and
went
up
the
hill
as
if
the
d
was
after
them
i
sent
word
to
them
by
the
other
two
that
if
they
ever
came
back
to
vicksburg
i
would
have
them
arrested
for
stealing
the
horses
i
did
not
wait
to
see
if
they
ever
did
come
back
but
sold
the
two
horses
i
had
left
for
and
took
the
next
boat
for
new
orleans
there
was
a
poor
woman
with
six
children
on
board
the
boat
and
she
did
not
have
any
money
to
pay
her
passage
so
we
passed
the
hat
around
and
every
person
on
the
boat
that
was
told
about
the
poor
woman
chipped
in
something
except
one
stingy
fellow
we
took
the
money
to
captain
leathers
as
we
were
on
his
boat
but
he
refused
to
accept
one
cent
for
her
passage
and
told
us
to
give
the
money
to
the
woman
he
gave
her
a
and
treated
her
as
if
she
was
paying
full
price
for
her
passage
after
the
poor
woman
and
her
children
had
been
taken
care
of
we
opened
up
monte
and
one
of
the
first
fellows
we
caught
was
the
man
who
would
not
chip
in
to
help
the
poor
woman
and
her
little
children
we
downed
him
for
and
he
kicked
like
a
government
mule
he
went
to
the
captain
who
had
been
told
how
mean
he
had
been
so
he
got
no
sympathy
from
him
or
any
one
else
the
passengers
called
him
old
stingy
and
asked
him
if
he
was
not
sorry
he
had
not
given
something
to
the
woman
before
he
lost
his
money
it
always
did
me
a
great
deal
of
good
to
down
a
stingy
man
for
i
knew
he
would
soon
have
more
even
if
he
had
to
starve
himself
to
get
it
detectives
and
watches
tripp
and
i
were
playing
the
trains
on
the
missouri
pacific
railroad
at
one
time
we
had
been
out
on
the
road
and
were
on
our
way
back
to
louis
and
had
got
away
with
all
the
suckers
on
the
train
i
was
enjoying
a
smoke
in
the
sleeper
when
a
nice
looking
gentleman
came
in
i
offered
him
a
cigar
telling
him
i
was
in
the
tobacco
business
at
new
orleans
we
talked
cigars
tobacco
etc
i
learned
he
was
a
united
states
detective
from
arkansas
on
his
way
to
washington
city
while
we
were
talking
and
smoking
in
came
tripp
dressed
up
like
a
he
told
his
story
and
finally
caught
the
fellow
for
the
detective
did
not
do
any
kicking
until
we
got
to
louis
then
he
went
to
the
chief
of
detectives
who
was
at
that
time
a
horrigan
he
told
the
chief
how
we
had
robbed
him
and
wanted
us
arrested
horrigan
was
a
sensible
man
and
knew
that
the
sucker
expected
to
win
our
money
or
he
would
not
have
lost
his
so
he
told
him
that
his
experience
was
worth
what
he
had
lost
and
that
he
had
no
time
to
hunt
up
gamblers
the
detective
went
on
to
washington
city
a
sadder
but
a
wiser
man
i
always
enjoyed
taking
in
detectives
for
they
think
themselves
too
smart
to
be
caught
they
are
but
human
and
like
other
mortals
can
be
landed
for
suckers
if
the
bait
is
good
and
nicely
handled
at
another
time
on
the
same
road
we
met
a
new
conductor
or
at
least
we
supposed
he
was
a
new
one
as
he
did
not
know
us
or
we
him
when
we
started
to
play
our
game
he
broke
back
to
the
sleeper
and
i
found
out
from
the
porter
that
he
went
to
the
superintendent
and
told
him
here
was
a
lot
of
gamblers
in
the
smoker
and
asked
him
what
he
should
do
the
superintendent
was
something
like
horrigan
the
chief
of
detectives
of
louis
for
he
told
the
conductor
to
look
after
his
train
and
let
the
gamblers
look
after
the
suckers
as
he
did
not
care
if
they
lost
all
their
money
for
they
would
not
bet
if
they
did
not
expect
to
win
i
inquired
the
name
of
the
superintendent
for
i
thought
he
must
be
a
brother
of
horrigan
but
his
name
was
different
we
downed
several
fellows
the
conductor
looked
on
but
did
not
say
a
word
i
learned
that
he
was
a
freight
conductor
and
had
never
run
a
passenger
train
before
so
i
excused
him
for
wanting
to
interfere
and
as
i
had
now
a
few
good
watches
i
let
him
have
one
very
cheap
and
he
appreciated
my
kindness
speaking
of
watches
i
had
orders
from
a
great
many
persons
to
win
them
certain
kinds
of
watches
so
when
i
got
one
to
suit
the
order
i
would
take
it
to
my
customer
in
place
of
the
pawn
shops
my
old
friend
simon
mccarthy
of
indianapolis
had
given
me
an
order
to
win
him
a
good
watch
so
one
day
going
into
the
city
i
downed
a
gentleman
for
some
money
and
his
watch
when
i
got
to
indianapolis
i
went
to
see
simon
and
told
him
i
had
a
watch
i
thought
would
suit
him
he
looked
at
it
and
when
he
opened
the
back
case
he
threw
up
both
hands
and
said
why
george
this
is
our
mayor
watch
where
did
you
get
it
i
told
him
i
won
it
coming
in
on
the
train
and
described
the
man
he
told
me
it
was
the
mayor
and
advised
me
to
return
it
to
him
i
learned
where
he
lived
went
to
his
house
rang
the
bell
and
asked
to
see
the
mayor
he
came
out
to
the
door
and
i
handed
him
his
ticker
he
asked
me
to
come
in
and
told
me
to
say
nothing
about
it
and
if
he
could
ever
do
me
a
favor
he
would
do
so
i
did
a
good
thing
for
myself
that
night
for
it
was
but
a
short
time
after
that
until
i
was
arrested
and
taken
before
his
honor
he
let
me
off
with
a
big
fine
and
after
my
prosecutors
were
gone
he
remitted
the
fine
and
we
then
had
a
drink
together
i
wanted
to
return
what
little
money
i
had
won
from
him
but
he
would
not
receive
it
saying
it
was
well
invested
fights
before
the
time
of
railroad
in
the
west
the
steamboats
on
the
ohio
mississippi
missouri
and
other
rivers
carried
a
great
many
passengers
as
it
was
the
most
pleasant
and
rapid
mode
of
travel
in
those
early
days
i
was
on
board
of
some
water
craft
nearly
all
the
time
for
forty
years
of
my
life
and
during
that
period
met
with
a
great
many
rough
characters
i
believe
that
i
can
truthfully
say
i
have
had
more
fights
in
the
cabin
and
bar
of
steamboats
than
any
other
man
in
this
country
i
never
tried
to
pick
a
fuss
with
any
man
but
in
my
business
it
was
very
hard
to
avoid
them
without
showing
the
white
feather
and
in
those
days
there
was
no
such
tint
in
my
plumage
the
officers
did
not
like
a
fuss
on
their
boats
but
most
of
them
had
rather
see
a
fellow
fight
than
to
take
an
insult
and
i
can
not
call
to
mind
just
now
a
single
case
in
all
my
many
fights
where
the
captain
of
a
boat
blamed
me
for
licking
my
man
but
i
do
remember
some
good
old
captains
who
would
rather
see
a
fight
than
eat
when
they
were
hungry
i
always
carried
the
very
best
pistol
that
could
be
bought
for
money
and
had
one
that
i
called
betsy
jane
for
which
i
paid
i
never
wanted
to
turn
her
loose
for
i
did
not
want
ever
to
kill
a
man
i
only
used
her
as
a
bluffer
and
she
has
often
responded
to
my
wants
successfully
i
was
on
board
the
steamer
coming
down
the
missouri
river
at
one
time
and
had
won
a
great
deal
of
money
one
big
fellow
lost
and
i
could
see
he
was
very
mad
about
it
he
would
go
to
the
bar
and
take
a
big
drink
and
then
come
back
to
the
table
finally
he
got
himself
nerved
up
pretty
well
so
he
said
to
the
bystanders
i
have
a
d
d
notion
to
kick
that
table
over
and
break
up
his
game
i
replied
it
will
do
you
no
good
to
kick
the
table
over
as
i
have
caught
all
the
suckers
and
am
now
going
to
quit
and
take
a
drink
i
started
to
the
bar
and
invited
all
hands
to
join
me
the
big
fellow
followed
but
would
not
take
a
drink
i
could
see
he
was
sizing
me
up
and
i
knew
he
wanted
some
of
my
mutton
so
i
said
to
him
we
have
all
had
a
drink
but
you
wo
you
join
me
he
replied
i
can
buy
my
own
drinks
and
you
can
go
to
h
i
did
not
reply
to
him
but
walked
out
into
the
cabin
he
followed
me
out
for
he
knew
he
had
me
afraid
of
him
by
my
not
resenting
the
insult
he
got
up
pretty
close
and
said
if
you
did
get
my
money
i
can
lick
you
i
told
him
he
had
better
find
an
easier
fight
when
he
let
fly
at
me
i
was
on
my
guard
caught
his
lick
on
my
arm
and
then
i
lit
into
him
and
we
had
it
all
around
the
hall
we
came
near
upsetting
the
stove
but
i
had
him
whipped
in
about
two
minutes
and
he
squealed
like
a
pig
under
a
gate
at
another
time
i
was
coming
down
the
missouri
river
from
joseph
to
louis
and
had
beaten
a
fellow
out
of
he
was
a
mill
man
from
louis
and
i
found
out
he
could
hit
a
pretty
hard
lick
i
was
playing
a
game
of
euchre
in
the
hall
after
closing
up
monte
when
this
fellow
slipped
up
and
hit
me
a
lick
on
the
side
of
the
neck
that
came
near
flooring
me
i
rallied
and
was
on
my
guard
in
an
instant
he
came
at
me
again
and
we
had
it
up
and
down
and
around
the
cabin
for
some
little
time
before
i
could
get
a
crack
at
him
with
my
head
when
the
old
head
did
get
a
chance
it
was
not
long
until
he
cried
quit
the
captain
and
every
one
who
saw
the
fellow
hit
me
from
behind
said
they
were
glad
to
see
him
get
licked
and
so
was
i
at
another
time
i
was
in
a
game
of
poker
on
the
steamer
coming
up
from
madison
and
there
was
a
big
blacksmith
in
the
game
who
was
very
quarrelsome
he
wanted
to
fight
every
time
he
would
lose
a
dollar
so
i
ran
him
up
a
hand
and
then
broke
him
he
left
the
game
and
went
into
the
bar
my
old
friend
jake
bloom
had
the
bar
at
the
time
the
big
fellow
told
jake
he
was
going
to
whip
that
fellow
they
called
colonel
when
the
game
was
over
jake
told
him
he
could
get
a
much
easier
fight
if
he
wanted
to
lick
some
one
he
replied
why
i
can
lick
that
fellow
in
a
minute
i
was
sitting
where
i
could
hear
what
he
said
so
as
there
was
very
little
more
money
in
the
party
i
was
playing
i
left
the
game
and
went
into
the
and
said
to
the
blacksmith
come
old
top
and
join
me
in
a
drink
for
i
beat
you
on
that
last
hand
he
replied
i
do
drink
with
such
fellows
as
you
he
had
hardly
got
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
before
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
for
i
gave
him
a
lick
under
the
chin
that
straightened
him
out
as
he
was
getting
up
i
let
the
old
head
go
and
down
he
went
again
he
said
that
will
do
so
i
let
up
on
him
he
went
to
his
room
and
did
not
leave
it
until
the
next
morning
when
he
had
to
be
led
off
the
boat
as
he
could
not
see
he
swore
out
a
warrant
for
my
arrest
but
when
the
policeman
came
to
get
me
the
clerk
told
him
i
had
left
the
boat
that
was
the
last
i
ever
heard
by
my
big
blacksmith
the
englishman
and
his
gun
every
nationality
has
its
suckers
and
it
would
be
pretty
hard
for
me
to
decide
which
has
the
most
for
i
have
in
my
time
downed
them
all
i
was
on
board
the
steamer
at
one
time
when
there
was
a
number
of
english
lads
among
the
passengers
they
had
come
over
to
this
country
to
hunt
the
buffalo
and
had
brought
their
guns
with
them
i
got
acquainted
with
them
as
they
were
often
in
the
after
the
bloody
blarsted
wine
and
they
liked
to
talk
about
old
and
their
fine
guns
you
know
i
got
one
of
them
to
show
me
his
gun
and
i
think
it
was
the
finest
piece
i
ever
saw
each
gun
had
two
sets
of
barrels
and
had
the
owner
name
engraved
on
it
inlaid
with
gold
and
not
one
of
them
cost
less
than
i
tried
to
buy
one
but
it
could
not
be
done
one
night
after
my
partner
had
gone
to
bed
i
was
in
the
when
one
of
the
english
lads
came
in
he
had
been
in
bed
but
got
up
to
get
a
blarsted
drink
and
he
invited
me
to
join
him
which
i
did
and
then
i
insisted
on
him
joining
me
in
a
small
bottle
we
drank
three
bottles
then
i
excused
myself
and
sent
for
my
partner
to
get
up
and
come
to
the
i
then
began
telling
the
english
lad
about
a
new
game
and
finally
i
got
out
the
tickets
and
was
showing
them
when
my
partner
came
in
about
half
asleep
he
like
the
english
lad
had
been
in
bed
and
had
got
up
to
get
a
drink
he
invited
us
to
join
him
as
he
did
not
like
to
drink
alone
we
accepted
and
as
the
lad
was
feeling
pretty
good
by
this
time
he
could
not
let
a
gentleman
treat
without
returning
the
compliment
you
know
my
partner
and
the
lad
got
to
guessing
for
fun
and
then
proposed
to
wager
the
wine
i
lost
a
bottle
and
so
did
my
partner
while
we
were
drinking
my
partner
put
a
crimp
in
the
baby
ticket
but
took
good
care
that
the
english
lad
saw
him
do
it
then
he
wanted
me
to
bet
money
on
the
game
and
i
said
i
have
two
chances
to
your
one
and
could
win
all
your
money
if
we
would
bet
the
englishman
laughed
and
said
why
lad
you
a
bloody
bit
of
a
chance
you
would
lose
every
blarsted
cent
you
if
you
bet
my
partner
kept
bantering
me
when
i
pulled
out
a
roll
of
greenbacks
that
made
them
open
their
eyes
saying
i
would
not
be
one
bit
afraid
to
wager
all
that
the
englishman
gave
me
a
nudge
and
said
lad
do
you
do
it
my
partner
then
said
i
have
got
so
much
money
but
i
will
bet
you
i
can
pick
up
the
baby
ticket
we
put
our
money
in
the
englishman
hand
and
i
turned
to
him
and
offered
to
bet
him
a
bottle
of
wine
that
i
would
win
the
money
he
took
me
up
my
partner
turned
the
card
and
i
lost
the
money
and
the
wine
he
wanted
to
bet
me
but
i
told
him
he
was
a
little
too
lucky
for
me
i
saw
johnnie
bull
was
crazy
to
bet
so
i
said
to
him
do
you
think
you
could
guess
the
baby
ticket
indeed
i
do
he
replied
i
will
wager
you
that
you
ca
he
got
out
his
leather
bag
and
counted
out
twenty
sovereigns
i
saw
he
had
plenty
more
so
i
would
not
bet
him
less
than
one
hundred
sovereigns
he
put
them
up
and
i
put
up
in
greenbacks
he
turned
the
card
and
lost
my
partner
made
him
believe
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
by
showing
him
that
the
corner
of
the
baby
ticket
was
still
turned
up
he
wanted
to
bet
with
me
so
i
took
him
for
and
he
won
that
made
johnnie
bull
hot
as
he
did
not
have
any
more
ready
money
except
maybe
i
saw
he
was
ready
for
anything
so
i
told
him
i
would
bet
him
against
his
gun
if
it
was
on
the
table
he
jumped
up
went
to
his
room
and
soon
returned
with
his
case
he
unlocked
it
and
showed
me
his
gun
i
put
in
the
hands
as
i
wanted
to
get
the
gun
where
he
could
not
snatch
it
and
run
as
i
expected
he
would
do
if
i
gave
him
a
chance
i
mixed
the
cards
and
he
went
for
the
baby
but
he
must
have
been
excited
for
he
missed
it
it
was
fun
to
see
him
he
looked
at
the
cards
at
me
and
my
partner
then
at
his
gun
case
but
it
was
behind
the
bar
and
he
could
not
get
it
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
he
said
oh
my
gun
i
lost
my
gun
he
walked
up
and
down
the
guards
coming
in
every
moment
to
look
at
his
gun
i
finally
told
him
if
he
would
raise
the
money
i
would
let
him
have
his
gun
for
then
he
was
happy
but
he
would
not
go
to
bed
or
leave
the
bar
for
fear
i
would
get
off
with
his
fine
english
gun
the
next
morning
he
told
his
companions
and
they
raised
the
in
less
than
no
time
i
heard
them
talking
one
would
say
to
another
the
lad
has
lost
his
gun
lads
and
we
must
get
the
bloody
thing
for
i
could
have
got
for
it
just
as
quick
as
the
i
tried
to
show
the
other
johnnie
bulls
how
the
lad
lost
his
gun
but
they
would
not
come
within
a
mile
of
the
table
i
bid
them
all
bye
and
left
the
boat
at
vicksburg
but
i
was
always
sorry
i
did
not
keep
that
gun
traveling
keno
away
back
in
the
fifties
when
there
was
but
few
railroads
in
the
northwest
i
went
by
stage
from
lacrosse
to
portage
city
wis
it
was
during
the
winter
season
and
a
bitter
cold
day
i
came
very
near
to
freezing
on
the
road
but
i
expected
to
make
money
and
i
guess
that
was
what
saved
me
i
had
a
keno
outfit
with
me
and
it
was
my
intention
to
play
the
surrounding
towns
after
the
manner
of
a
traveling
show
the
first
thing
to
be
done
after
my
arrival
was
to
get
thawed
out
then
to
see
the
mayor
and
get
his
permission
or
license
to
advertise
and
run
my
game
i
called
upon
his
honor
and
stated
my
business
he
did
not
know
much
about
keno
so
i
explained
the
little
innocent
game
to
him
the
result
was
i
got
authority
to
open
my
game
i
secured
a
room
that
had
been
used
as
a
and
advertised
that
i
would
open
the
next
night
and
in
a
short
time
after
the
door
was
opened
the
room
was
full
of
pupils
some
of
them
had
never
been
to
such
a
school
so
i
had
to
teach
them
the
first
principles
but
it
did
not
take
me
very
long
as
all
those
that
had
taken
lessons
rendered
me
all
the
assistance
in
their
power
and
i
was
very
thankful
for
it
as
i
was
anxious
to
get
to
work
after
distributing
the
books
i
began
to
call
the
numbers
and
i
must
say
i
never
saw
a
more
quiet
and
attentive
set
of
pupils
in
a
we
were
getting
along
so
nicely
that
i
began
to
think
it
a
pleasure
to
teach
such
nice
boys
when
a
great
big
fellow
came
in
stalked
all
around
the
and
made
so
much
noise
that
i
had
to
call
some
of
the
numbers
over
again
some
of
the
boys
told
him
to
sit
down
take
a
book
and
study
his
lesson
but
he
would
not
do
it
i
saw
he
was
a
bad
boy
and
would
not
let
the
other
boys
alone
so
i
spoke
to
him
very
kindly
telling
him
to
sit
down
and
see
if
he
could
not
learn
something
but
he
was
one
of
the
worst
boys
i
ever
saw
for
he
told
me
to
go
to
h
l
and
he
would
do
just
as
he
pleased
i
remembered
when
i
went
to
school
how
my
teacher
used
to
serve
me
when
i
was
a
bad
boy
and
would
annoy
the
other
boys
so
i
told
the
scholars
we
would
take
a
recess
for
about
twenty
minutes
they
all
threw
down
their
books
and
most
of
them
went
out
to
play
during
recess
i
walked
up
to
the
bad
boy
and
said
you
are
a
very
bad
boy
to
come
in
here
and
annoy
my
pupils
and
you
deserve
a
whipping
he
replied
you
are
not
man
enough
to
whip
me
that
was
all
i
wanted
him
to
say
so
i
let
fly
and
gave
him
a
good
one
on
the
jaw
and
then
i
kept
it
up
until
he
cried
worse
than
i
ever
did
when
i
went
to
school
he
got
out
of
that
school
room
faster
than
he
came
in
and
then
i
called
order
and
went
on
with
my
duties
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
out
of
the
regular
order
i
remained
in
portage
city
for
some
time
my
pupils
liked
me
and
paid
their
tuition
promptly
some
of
them
paid
much
more
than
they
could
well
afford
but
they
did
it
voluntarily
i
went
from
portage
to
madison
where
i
had
a
good
game
but
i
had
to
whip
a
fellow
the
second
day
and
in
fact
i
had
one
or
more
fights
in
every
town
i
went
to
for
there
is
nearly
always
some
big
bully
in
a
town
or
city
that
has
whipped
some
one
and
he
thinks
that
every
one
is
afraid
of
him
and
he
can
do
just
as
he
pleases
but
they
found
out
that
they
could
not
run
me
on
my
keno
business
a
bull
fight
the
steamer
was
on
an
upward
trip
two
days
out
from
new
orleans
a
crowd
of
gentlemen
were
gathered
about
the
bar
punishing
wine
at
a
bottle
with
flushed
faces
jocund
laughter
and
the
incessant
pop
of
the
champagne
corks
the
time
flew
unheeded
past
the
barkeeper
smiled
when
at
the
little
window
of
the
bar
the
ebony
head
of
a
stalwart
negro
appeared
say
boss
gim
me
some
whisky
everybody
turned
and
laughter
that
was
about
to
burst
forth
or
the
jest
that
was
ready
was
hushed
for
the
negro
head
was
split
open
and
the
blood
pouring
down
his
cheeks
in
rivulets
crimsoning
his
swarthy
shiny
skin
and
clothing
been
fighting
said
the
barkeeper
yes
de
fireman
he
butted
me
up
came
the
mate
who
observed
we
got
a
fireman
down
below
who
has
killed
two
or
three
niggers
by
butting
them
to
death
with
his
head
send
him
up
i
said
and
i
butt
him
till
he
is
sick
of
butting
we
had
all
been
drinking
wine
and
everybody
laughed
supposing
that
it
was
the
liquor
talking
and
not
me
why
devol
i
would
give
five
cents
for
your
head
if
that
nigger
gets
a
lick
at
it
spoke
up
a
young
planter
who
was
in
the
party
then
i
got
mad
and
exclaimed
i
bet
i
can
make
the
nigger
squeal
the
mate
roared
out
with
laughter
but
i
put
up
my
money
and
so
did
the
young
planter
thinking
that
i
would
back
out
he
only
had
in
his
roll
and
he
offered
to
bet
that
all
right
i
do
back
out
i
butt
the
nigger
for
the
money
was
soon
up
in
the
barkeeper
hands
and
then
the
mate
knew
that
i
meant
business
and
he
put
up
to
make
bet
the
even
at
this
juncture
the
mate
called
a
halt
wait
till
i
see
if
the
nigger
will
butt
with
a
white
man
and
rushing
down
stairs
the
image
of
god
cut
in
ebony
was
interviewed
i
doant
like
for
to
butt
a
white
man
he
said
for
i
afraid
i
kill
him
and
den
dey
hang
de
ole
nigger
but
the
mate
said
i
just
put
up
on
you
and
i
want
to
win
it
all
right
if
yer
means
it
boss
i
go
yer
at
the
bar
i
procured
a
long
string
and
a
ribbon
from
a
cigar
bunch
and
started
down
stairs
instantly
the
wildest
excitement
reigned
on
the
boat
two
of
the
stood
guard
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
to
keep
the
crowd
back
and
the
hurricane
roof
and
boiler
deck
were
thronged
with
an
eager
and
excited
crowd
fastening
one
end
of
the
string
to
the
and
the
other
to
the
steps
at
about
the
proper
height
the
ribbon
was
tied
in
the
centre
of
the
string
and
the
black
man
and
myself
stood
back
five
feet
on
either
side
and
at
a
given
signal
were
to
come
forward
and
strike
at
the
ribbon
then
the
passengers
said
it
was
a
shame
to
let
that
nasty
nigger
butt
that
nice
white
man
to
death
but
as
there
were
no
officers
aboard
the
game
went
on
the
all
rolled
up
their
eyes
and
looked
at
me
as
they
would
at
a
corpse
just
before
the
word
ready
was
given
i
asked
the
nigger
if
he
had
any
money
to
put
up
on
the
result
and
running
his
hand
down
in
his
he
pulled
out
a
bill
i
covered
it
and
the
planter
told
the
nigger
he
would
give
him
more
if
he
downed
me
i
cocked
my
eye
on
the
nigger
head
and
saw
that
it
was
one
of
those
cocoanuts
so
peculiar
to
people
of
african
descent
so
i
inwardly
resolved
to
hit
him
on
one
side
of
his
cranium
the
nigger
had
his
face
to
the
sun
so
that
i
felt
confident
that
i
could
hit
him
pretty
near
where
i
wanted
to
the
word
was
given
and
at
the
ribbon
we
both
rushed
like
a
couple
of
frenzied
bulls
i
gave
him
a
glancing
blow
that
skinned
his
head
for
about
three
inches
the
next
time
there
was
a
crash
a
jar
that
shook
the
boat
and
drew
a
shriek
of
terror
from
the
passengers
for
the
nigger
fell
with
a
dull
thud
on
the
deck
he
lay
as
stiff
and
cold
as
a
dead
man
dat
nigger
is
done
gone
dead
dat
nigger
is
no
good
any
more
shouted
the
alarmed
roustabouts
the
mate
lifted
him
up
and
he
began
bleeding
from
the
nose
eyes
and
ears
the
mate
kindly
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
butt
any
more
he
did
not
reply
only
shook
his
head
sadly
and
murmured
inaudibly
no
they
applied
whisky
and
water
to
his
head
and
at
last
removed
him
into
the
deck
to
cool
off
many
years
have
rolled
by
and
i
have
never
heard
the
last
of
that
butting
adventure
the
papers
wrote
it
up
and
in
less
than
ten
days
every
planter
on
the
coast
had
heard
of
it
the
planter
who
lost
the
tells
the
story
to
this
day
and
bill
patterson
the
mate
he
is
dead
now
used
to
tell
it
to
every
new
crew
that
he
shipped
towards
night
the
old
nigger
came
crawling
up
stairs
and
said
massa
you
have
done
for
this
poor
nigger
for
i
must
go
to
the
hospital
and
get
cured
up
i
returned
him
his
and
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
the
passengers
paid
for
everything
i
wanted
to
drink
it
shook
the
checks
it
never
pays
a
man
to
be
too
officious
and
volunteer
information
or
advice
when
it
is
not
asked
for
he
very
often
makes
enemies
and
courts
a
disturbance
that
he
could
easily
have
avoided
if
he
had
simply
minded
his
own
business
some
seven
years
ago
i
attended
a
fair
at
cynthiana
and
opened
out
a
gentleman
game
in
the
smith
hotel
there
were
a
number
of
sports
from
louisville
and
cincinnati
present
and
everything
was
moving
along
lively
and
as
decorous
as
a
funeral
when
some
of
the
paris
and
louisville
boys
indulged
in
a
scrimmage
and
were
arrested
everybody
left
the
hotel
and
went
to
see
the
result
of
the
trial
i
sat
near
the
judge
and
when
the
evidence
was
all
in
i
whispered
to
him
to
fine
them
each
this
he
did
and
as
we
were
leaving
the
i
noticed
that
a
big
fellow
from
paris
regarded
me
with
very
sour
looks
after
supper
i
opened
up
my
game
and
in
he
came
and
going
to
the
whispered
in
a
tone
of
voice
loud
enough
for
me
to
hear
i
am
going
to
whip
that
dealer
pretty
soon
i
closed
up
the
game
and
then
sam
aliways
and
myself
took
a
turn
around
the
town
and
running
into
a
saloon
met
the
big
bully
he
had
his
coat
off
and
a
a
foot
long
hanging
to
his
side
so
edging
up
to
where
he
stood
i
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
observing
you
are
the
gentleman
that
is
looking
for
a
fight
as
soon
as
he
saw
who
it
was
he
grabbed
for
his
but
just
as
he
got
hold
of
the
handle
i
dealt
him
a
blow
in
the
neck
and
he
fell
over
against
the
counter
but
i
soon
grabbed
him
and
hit
him
a
butt
with
my
head
that
ended
the
fight
he
had
sense
enough
to
say
that
will
do
and
seeing
a
policeman
coming
in
one
door
i
went
out
another
hastened
to
the
hotel
and
paid
my
bill
and
caught
the
train
for
covington
i
was
none
too
quick
however
for
the
next
day
when
aliways
came
along
with
my
tools
he
said
that
the
fellow
had
a
host
of
friends
in
the
town
and
that
at
least
fifty
fellows
came
around
armed
with
axes
shotguns
revolvers
and
rocks
and
that
if
they
had
caught
me
i
would
have
met
a
fate
worse
than
the
martyr
stephen
or
the
chicago
anarchists
the
fellow
went
by
the
name
of
bill
legrets
when
he
was
asked
why
he
did
shoot
me
he
said
shoot
h
the
first
lick
he
hit
me
i
thought
my
neck
was
disjointed
and
when
he
ran
that
head
into
me
i
though
it
was
a
bob
linn
was
dealing
up
stairs
at
the
time
and
he
afterwards
said
that
when
the
bloody
duffer
fell
to
the
floor
that
all
the
checks
on
the
table
trembled
like
aspen
leaves
poor
fellow
he
is
dead
now
having
been
shot
in
paris
a
few
years
since
with
a
poker
once
when
traveling
in
the
west
and
winning
some
money
from
a
man
from
kansas
city
some
smart
aleck
told
him
that
i
had
cheated
him
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
kill
me
on
sight
i
made
some
inquiries
and
ascertained
that
he
was
a
desperate
man
and
had
already
killed
his
two
men
accordingly
i
put
my
gun
in
my
pocket
and
staid
about
the
town
just
keeping
my
eyes
on
the
lookout
and
at
last
went
up
to
omaha
i
was
sitting
one
evening
playing
the
bank
having
forgotten
all
about
the
kansas
city
man
when
a
friend
of
mine
came
to
me
and
said
that
the
man
was
in
the
adjoining
room
and
would
soon
be
in
to
play
faro
i
lost
no
time
in
making
my
preparations
to
meet
the
gentleman
my
friend
had
no
pistol
nor
had
i
but
seeing
a
poker
lying
on
the
floor
near
the
stove
i
rushed
for
it
and
as
i
knew
i
could
not
go
out
without
going
through
the
room
where
he
was
i
simply
put
the
poker
under
my
coat
and
got
up
close
to
the
door
that
led
into
the
faro
room
and
awaited
his
arrival
it
was
not
long
and
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
and
was
sure
i
let
drive
and
caught
him
square
in
the
mouth
knocking
him
stiff
then
i
rushed
forward
and
grabbing
him
secured
his
pistol
as
i
thought
he
would
in
all
probability
turn
it
loose
on
me
then
i
attended
to
his
head
for
a
few
minutes
endeavoring
to
kick
the
fight
out
of
him
i
learned
afterwards
that
he
had
a
very
bad
reputation
having
killed
three
men
and
been
warned
off
the
plains
by
a
vigilant
committee
he
was
confined
to
his
bed
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
i
was
congratulated
on
all
sides
for
having
walloped
the
fellow
left
in
time
or
forty
years
ago
the
cincinnati
boats
used
to
carry
a
great
many
passengers
and
the
new
orleans
boats
were
always
well
filled
i
once
got
aboard
the
at
vicksburg
there
was
a
full
passenger
list
and
when
i
opened
up
there
was
at
once
a
crowd
around
my
frugal
board
they
seemed
to
enjoy
the
fair
and
i
won
a
good
pile
of
money
at
last
we
reached
bayou
plaquemine
at
which
point
there
was
a
strong
current
sweeping
down
the
bayou
so
that
were
frequently
driven
in
there
and
stranded
the
undertook
to
land
at
the
mouth
of
the
bayou
but
the
current
which
flowed
like
a
was
too
strong
and
she
started
down
the
bayou
they
headed
her
at
once
for
the
bank
and
her
stern
swung
around
and
lodging
against
the
opposite
bank
formed
a
perfect
bridge
across
the
mouth
of
the
bayou
the
boat
was
loaded
to
the
guards
and
the
water
ran
through
her
deck
rooms
so
rapidly
that
i
thought
every
minute
she
would
sink
or
fill
with
water
but
they
put
weight
on
the
hatches
then
dug
around
the
stern
so
as
to
let
her
swing
around
just
then
two
boats
came
along
one
upward
bound
and
the
other
down
one
of
them
pushed
and
the
other
pulled
the
boat
off
and
then
i
began
to
look
around
only
to
see
that
all
the
passengers
had
gone
ashore
after
wandering
about
the
town
the
suckers
decided
it
was
time
to
kick
and
have
me
arrested
but
i
divined
what
was
in
the
wind
and
like
lord
arab
silently
folded
my
tent
and
crept
away
i
reached
new
orleans
first
on
the
circuit
during
the
summer
of
the
centennial
year
i
followed
the
races
gambling
on
horses
running
faro
bank
red
and
black
old
monte
and
anything
else
that
came
up
i
had
a
partner
at
the
beginning
by
the
name
of
john
bull
of
chicago
and
he
was
a
good
clever
boy
he
dealt
faro
and
i
the
red
and
black
we
separated
at
jackson
he
going
to
chicago
and
i
to
cleveland
where
i
witnessed
the
great
race
between
goldsmith
maid
and
the
horse
smuggler
on
which
i
lost
some
money
but
i
had
a
good
game
of
red
and
black
so
i
was
about
even
i
then
concluded
i
would
follow
the
trotters
through
the
circuit
while
sitting
at
the
hotel
one
day
in
cleveland
i
saw
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
a
face
and
form
that
i
thought
i
recognized
i
ran
over
and
sure
enough
it
was
my
old
partner
canada
bill
and
with
him
another
great
capper
by
the
name
of
dutch
charlie
i
was
more
than
glad
to
see
bill
and
he
was
very
glad
to
see
me
he
wanted
me
to
tell
him
where
i
had
been
what
i
had
been
doing
and
where
i
was
going
and
would
up
by
saying
george
let
go
and
get
something
we
soon
found
a
and
began
telling
each
other
all
that
had
happened
since
we
were
last
together
i
told
bill
i
had
about
made
up
my
mind
to
follow
the
horses
through
the
circuit
he
told
me
that
he
and
charlie
were
going
to
do
the
same
thing
and
insisted
that
i
should
join
allowing
as
how
we
three
would
make
a
good
strong
team
i
agreed
so
it
was
settled
we
would
all
work
together
while
we
were
talking
a
fellow
who
i
took
to
be
a
store
clerk
walked
in
and
bill
invited
him
to
take
a
drink
which
he
did
and
i
was
introduced
to
mason
long
who
now
styles
himself
the
converted
gambler
bill
charlie
and
i
left
cleveland
and
went
to
buffalo
but
the
night
we
left
we
had
downed
a
sucker
for
and
thought
best
not
to
wait
for
morning
we
caught
some
good
ones
on
the
trip
over
and
they
set
up
a
great
big
kick
they
telegraphed
a
description
of
bill
to
buffalo
so
we
got
him
to
get
off
before
we
reached
the
city
telling
him
where
to
meet
charlie
and
myself
the
next
day
we
went
on
to
the
city
and
waited
for
bill
to
show
up
which
he
did
the
next
night
he
was
too
smart
to
come
in
by
rail
so
he
got
a
man
to
drive
him
in
we
kept
him
in
his
hotel
for
a
few
days
until
we
thought
the
kickers
that
we
had
beat
out
of
had
left
the
city
then
we
made
him
dress
up
in
store
clothes
which
he
did
not
like
a
bit
saying
i
do
feel
good
in
the
tarnal
stuff
things
nohow
we
thought
best
not
to
try
our
old
games
in
buffalo
for
fear
the
police
would
be
looking
for
bill
so
we
played
the
faro
banks
bet
on
horses
and
quit
big
losers
at
the
end
of
the
week
dutch
charlie
saved
his
money
he
did
not
play
the
bank
or
horses
and
it
was
well
for
us
that
he
did
not
for
we
always
had
a
roll
to
use
in
making
a
bluff
which
sometimes
we
would
not
have
had
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
we
went
from
buffalo
to
rochester
and
as
we
did
not
catch
any
kicking
sucker
on
the
way
down
we
had
clear
sailing
during
the
week
we
won
a
pile
of
money
at
monte
but
bill
and
i
lost
heavily
at
the
races
and
faro
banks
from
rochester
we
went
to
utica
where
i
remained
but
a
day
or
two
then
concluded
to
run
down
to
philadelphia
and
see
the
exposition
i
bid
the
boys
promising
to
return
before
they
left
utica
i
did
not
take
but
little
money
with
me
as
i
did
not
expect
to
do
any
bluffing
while
i
was
away
i
took
in
the
faro
banks
the
first
night
and
the
next
day
did
not
have
a
dollar
i
started
out
on
the
street
and
soon
met
a
man
that
i
knew
by
the
name
of
john
wilson
i
saw
by
his
actions
he
was
like
myself
running
light
for
he
did
not
ask
me
to
take
something
which
i
knew
was
his
custom
for
he
was
a
clever
fellow
we
understood
each
other
very
soon
and
parted
i
had
not
gone
very
far
until
i
heard
some
one
call
my
name
i
looked
up
and
saw
two
old
friends
of
mine
from
new
orleans
in
a
carriage
that
had
just
passed
me
then
i
knew
i
had
struck
oil
i
lost
no
time
in
getting
alongside
of
that
rig
and
shaking
hands
with
samuel
debow
and
wm
graham
from
my
adopted
home
they
invited
me
to
accompany
them
to
the
exposition
grounds
which
i
was
very
glad
to
do
they
soon
saw
by
my
actions
that
something
was
out
of
tune
so
they
pressed
me
to
know
what
it
was
i
told
them
and
i
soon
had
all
the
money
i
wanted
after
taking
in
the
exposition
and
a
very
large
quantity
of
wine
i
bid
my
friends
promising
to
meet
them
in
saratoga
within
a
week
i
went
back
to
utica
and
found
that
the
boys
bill
and
charlie
had
won
and
they
insisted
that
i
was
in
with
it
from
utica
we
went
to
poughkeepsie
and
in
a
few
days
i
again
left
the
boys
to
meet
my
new
orleans
friends
at
saratoga
i
put
up
at
the
same
hotel
where
they
were
stopping
the
next
day
we
took
in
the
races
where
i
met
another
friend
by
the
name
of
rufus
hunt
he
was
well
posted
and
gave
us
some
good
pointers
we
bought
pools
and
won
then
we
all
tried
to
see
how
much
wine
we
could
take
in
and
i
do
believe
we
got
in
worth
canada
bill
came
over
and
we
spent
a
week
with
my
friends
then
we
promised
to
meet
them
in
new
york
city
and
left
for
poughkeepsie
where
we
found
dutch
charlie
and
we
all
took
a
hudson
river
boat
called
the
for
new
york
on
our
way
down
we
got
into
a
friendly
game
of
euchre
with
an
old
gent
and
we
relieved
him
of
after
dinner
i
went
up
on
the
roof
and
saw
my
old
friend
captain
leathers
of
the
steamer
in
the
house
he
was
insisting
that
his
boat
could
beat
the
and
when
he
saw
me
he
said
i
can
prove
it
by
that
man
coming
up
here
now
i
was
glad
to
see
the
old
fellow
so
far
from
home
so
i
told
the
pilot
that
the
was
the
fastest
boat
on
the
mississippi
and
captain
leathers
went
down
to
see
the
boys
and
the
barkeeper
bill
charlie
and
i
remained
in
new
york
for
some
time
and
we
proved
what
old
bill
said
in
cleveland
we
three
would
make
a
good
strong
team
the
time
came
when
i
was
compelled
to
leave
the
boys
and
go
to
chicago
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
old
canada
bill
and
dutch
charlie
until
the
following
winter
when
they
both
came
down
to
new
orleans
and
them
we
again
made
the
suckers
think
we
three
were
a
good
team
strategem
we
went
on
board
of
captain
william
eads
boat
at
charles
late
one
night
and
found
that
all
the
were
taken
and
we
could
get
no
bed
there
was
no
one
up
about
the
cabin
except
the
officers
of
the
boat
and
as
we
never
tried
to
win
their
money
things
looked
a
little
blue
for
any
business
before
morning
unless
some
of
the
passengers
could
be
got
up
young
bill
eads
a
son
of
the
captain
was
one
of
the
pilots
on
the
boat

was
off
watch
and
at
the
bar
drunk
when
we
got
on
board
his
father
had
married
a
young
wife
that
day
and
was
taking
his
wedding
trip
on
that
boat
young
bill
was
mad
because
his
father
had
secured
a
young
for
him
and
was
just
raising
ned
about
it
a
short
time
after
going
on
board
the
boat
made
a
landing
and
while
we
were
tied
up
the
other
pilot
came
down
to
the
bar
to
see
bill
and
also
to
get
something
his
name
was
john
consall
an
old
friend
of
mine
i
invited
him
and
bill
to
join
me
and
while
we
were
drinking
i
said
i
wish
we
could
get
up
a
little
excitement
so
some
of
the
suckers
would
come
out
of
their
holes
young
bill
replied
i
get
them
out
for
you
and
that
d
d
quick
john
consall
went
back
to
the
and
soon
had
the
boat
on
her
way
bill
went
out
and
in
about
twenty
minutes
there
was
the
darndest
racket
on
that
boat
you
ever
heard
everybody
was
sneezing
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
you
would
have
thought
they
were
trying
to
blow
the
roof
off
from
the
amount
of
noise
they
made
bill
came
up
to
us
out
on
the
guards
and
said
did
i
tell
you
i
would
drive
them
out
of
their
holes
i
looked
into
the
cabin
and
sure
enough
everybody
was
out
of
their
rooms
rushing
up
and
down
the
cabin
and
finally
out
on
the
guards
old
captain
bill
and
young
bill
new
were
among
the
crowd
and
it
was
fun
the
see
the
young
bride
rushing
around
after
her
old
hubby
trying
to
keep
him
from
blowing
up
the
boat
with
his
sneezing
and
cursing
he
would
pull
away
from
her
every
time
he
would
make
a
big
sneeze
and
then
he
would
curse
until
another
one
would
overtake
him
he
and
young
bill
knew
what
was
the
cause
of
all
the
racket
and
the
old
one
soon
learned
who
had
put
the
red
pepper
on
the
hot
stove
he
tried
to
find
his
bad
boy
but
he
was
up
on
the
roof
so
his
did
not
get
to
see
her
hubby
throw
him
overboard
as
he
swore
he
would
do
if
he
caught
him
they
opened
all
the
doors
and
soon
the
red
pepper
was
all
out
of
the
cabins
and
the
old
captain
and
all
the
passengers
except
a
few
good
suckers
went
back
to
bed
young
bill
came
out
of
his
and
we
all
took
something
to
wash
down
the
pepper
we
went
to
work
on
the
fellows
who
remained
up
and
won
besides
several
good
watches
which
we
would
not
have
had
a
chance
to
do
if
the
passengers
had
not
been
sneezed
out
i
appreciated
the
part
bill
and
john
had
played
and
presented
each
with
a
good
watch
at
another
time
i
got
on
a
boat
after
all
the
passengers
had
gone
to
bed
and
did
not
want
to
wait
until
morning
without
doing
some
business
so
i
inquired
after
the
passengers
and
learned
that
there
was
one
on
board
who
had
been
drinking
and
flashing
his
money
i
sent
the
porter
to
his
room
and
told
him
to
knock
and
tell
him
to
get
up
at
once
that
the
boat
was
on
fire
but
for
him
not
to
make
any
noise
in
an
instant
the
fellow
was
into
a
part
of
his
clothes
and
out
into
the
cabin
he
rushed
up
to
where
we
were
sitting
and
wanted
to
know
where
the
fire
was
we
told
him
down
stairs
under
the
boiler
then
he
told
us
that
some
one
came
to
his
room
and
told
him
the
boat
was
on
fire
we
laughed
and
told
him
he
must
have
been
dreaming
and
he
thought
he
must
have
been
if
we
had
heard
nothing
about
it
we
all
took
something
at
his
expense
and
then
my
partner
began
to
throw
the
tickets
we
beat
him
out
of
and
as
he
started
to
the
room
he
said
i
wish
the
d
d
boat
had
been
on
fire
mobile
general
canby
captured
mobile
taking
prisoners
cannon
and
bales
of
cotton
on
the
day
of
april
and
this
about
closed
the
war
of
the
rebellion
i
was
in
new
orleans
at
the
time
running
the
and
my
games
i
knew
there
would
be
plenty
of
money
at
mobile
after
the
union
army
took
possession
and
i
resolved
to
get
over
there
just
as
soon
as
possible
so
in
a
short
time
after
the
surrender
i
was
in
mobile
trying
to
get
permission
to
open
up
my
games
it
was
not
long
until
i
had
a
faro
bank
in
full
blast
in
the
city
and
a
and
wheel
game
at
a
resort
on
the
shell
road
about
seven
miles
out
from
the
city
i
had
a
partner
in
the
faro
bank
by
the
name
of
pettypan
he
was
a
creole
and
not
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
by
any
means
when
in
liquor
he
looked
after
the
city
trade
while
i
ran
the
game
out
on
the
shell
road
in
which
he
had
no
interest
the
union
officers
and
all
the
citizens
that
could
afford
it
would
drive
out
to
the
where
i
was
holding
forth
and
i
was
making
a
barrel
of
money
out
of
them
my
old
friend
and
former
partner
charlie
bush
was
running
faro
in
new
orleans
and
when
he
heard
how
much
money
i
was
making
at
mobile
he
came
over
to
run
opposition
i
gave
him
a
call
and
he
downed
me
for
a
big
roll
he
made
big
money
and
then
wanted
to
go
back
to
new
orleans
without
leaving
any
of
it
but
the
grand
jury
indicted
him
and
made
him
come
down
pretty
heavy
they
got
an
indictment
against
me
at
the
same
time
but
somehow
it
got
into
a
and
i
guess
it
is
there
yet
for
i
never
heard
anything
of
it
after
bush
left
my
partner
in
the
faro
bank
was
a
little
jealous
of
me
for
i
was
making
more
money
out
on
the
shell
road
than
he
was
in
the
city
one
day
when
we
were
settling
up
our
bank
account
he
got
mad
as
he
was
drunk
and
pulled
his
gun
and
said
he
would
shoot
me
he
knew
i
did
not
have
any
gun
with
me
so
he
took
this
advantage
i
saw
he
had
me
so
i
just
opened
my
vest
and
told
him
to
shoot
that
made
him
ashamed
of
himself
and
he
put
up
his
gun
and
apologized
i
was
dealing
red
and
black
at
the
resort
one
night
when
an
officer
came
up
and
said
i
bet
on
the
red
i
replied
which
do
you
mean
then
he
said
it
do
make
any
difference
which
i
say
i
will
bet
you
on
the
red
no
bet
goes
on
this
layout
unless
the
money
is
up
i
said
he
then
straightened
himself
to
over
six
feet
and
said
you
are
a
d
d
rascal
that
is
the
conclusion
i
have
come
to
about
you
i
remarked
then
he
made
a
rush
for
me
and
at
it
we
went
we
had
a
lively
time
for
a
few
moments
but
i
soon
got
a
chance
to
give
him
my
old
head
and
he
hollowed
enough
he
went
away
and
washed
himself
and
i
did
not
see
any
more
of
him
his
fellow
officers
heard
how
he
had
acted
and
as
he
was
a
very
quarrelsome
man
they
told
me
i
served
him
just
right
and
they
were
all
glad
of
it
and
i
had
a
better
game
after
that
than
before
i
remained
at
mobile
for
some
time
then
sold
out
and
went
back
to
good
old
new
orleans
for
it
was
hard
in
those
days
to
stay
away
any
great
length
of
time
and
even
now
i
feel
more
at
home
there
than
any
other
place
in
this
country
sometime
after
my
return
to
new
orleans
i
was
taken
down
with
the
yellow
fever
of
which
i
have
spoken
in
a
preceding
story
i
remained
for
a
few
months
when
i
took
a
notion
to
go
north
so
i
sold
out
and
again
i
was
on
board
one
of
the
packets
going
up
the
old
mississippi
i
played
all
the
old
games
up
to
louis
and
then
i
took
a
missouri
river
packet
and
went
to
omaha
still
keeping
up
my
games
i
then
started
out
on
the
union
pacific
railroad
and
went
as
far
as
julesburg
which
was
at
that
time
the
terminus
i
remained
there
playing
the
contractors
and
every
one
else
i
could
get
a
hold
of
until
the
road
was
finished
to
cheyenne
city
i
won
a
great
deal
of
money
but
as
the
good
old
game
of
faro
followed
in
the
track
of
civilization
and
the
railroad
i
lost
nearly
as
fast
as
i
won
i
remained
in
the
west
for
five
months
when
the
old
desire
to
get
back
home
on
the
mississippi
took
possession
of
me
and
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
so
i
turned
my
face
to
the
east
and
in
a
short
time
i
was
in
joseph
where
i
met
my
old
friend
ben
allman
who
was
running
a
fine
large
billiard
hall
i
concluded
to
stop
and
open
a
keno
room
so
i
went
to
chicago
bought
a
very
fine
outfit
and
opened
up
over
place
i
advertised
my
business
in
all
the
papers
just
as
a
dry
goods
merchant
would
advertise
his
business
my
keno
netted
me
from
to
per
day
and
i
set
a
lunch
each
night
at
a
cost
of
most
men
would
have
been
content
but
i
was
not
as
i
still
longed
for
the
life
i
had
led
for
so
many
years
on
the
river
so
i
sold
out
and
was
soon
in
louis
ready
for
a
down
river
packet
on
my
way
down
i
won
considerable
money
and
that
together
with
the
fact
that
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
the
place
i
loved
so
well
made
me
happy
one
night
i
went
on
board
a
boat
that
was
so
crowded
with
passengers
that
i
could
not
get
a
room
so
i
opened
up
monte
and
as
i
was
winning
money
i
did
not
realize
that
i
was
sleepy
until
they
began
to
make
up
cots
in
the
cabin
and
most
all
the
passengers
had
gone
to
bed
then
i
would
have
given
almost
any
price
for
a
place
to
sleep
but
all
the
cots
were
engaged
and
i
was
left
nothing
remained
for
me
but
to
patronize
the
bar
which
i
was
doing
when
a
man
came
in
to
get
a
drink
that
had
been
asleep
on
one
of
the
cots
i
told
him
as
he
had
been
resting
if
he
would
let
me
have
his
cot
for
the
balance
of
the
night
i
would
give
him
he
accepted
my
proposition
and
i
went
to
bed
i
had
been
lying
down
but
a
few
moments
when
there
was
a
fuss
started
near
me
i
raised
up
to
see
what
was
the
cause
when
i
saw
two
jews
that
had
come
aboard
at
baton
rouge
and
they
were
fighting
for
the
possession
of
a
cot
i
got
up
and
told
them
to
stop
their
fighting
and
join
me
in
a
drink
they
accepted
the
invitation
while
we
were
drinking
i
learned
that
they
had
been
playing
cards
at
baton
rouge
before
they
had
got
on
the
boat
and
had
had
a
falling
out
over
the
game
i
told
them
i
saw
a
fellow
playing
a
game
that
beat
anything
i
ever
had
seen
they
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
so
i
showed
them
the
three
cards
and
in
a
short
time
i
had
won
from
them
i
forgot
all
about
being
sleepy
while
i
was
working
up
the
jew
boys
and
by
the
time
i
had
won
their
money
the
steward
was
clearing
the
cabin
to
set
the
tables
for
breakfast
i
had
lost
the
sleep
for
which
i
had
paid
but
i
did
not
mind
it
much
as
i
had
won
a
duck
hunt
during
the
winter
season
wild
ducks
are
so
plentiful
around
new
orleans
that
a
good
wing
shot
can
bag
a
hundred
of
them
in
a
few
hours
i
have
often
seen
men
coming
in
on
the
boats
and
trains
with
hundreds
of
nice
wild
ducks
and
at
such
times
i
would
promise
myself
to
lay
off
and
have
a
hunt
so
one
morning
i
took
my
gun
and
about
a
hundred
rounds
of
ammunition
and
went
out
on
the
railroad
to
lake
pontchartrain
i
killed
at
least
ducks
but
only
got
six
of
them
as
they
fell
in
the
water
and
i
had
no
dog
to
fetch
them
i
went
back
to
the
station
with
my
six
ducks
and
there
i
saw
five
frenchmen
and
some
dogs
and
they
had
about
ducks
i
felt
ashamed
of
myself
so
i
tried
to
buy
some
of
their
ducks
but
they
would
not
sell
then
i
thought
i
would
interest
them
in
old
monte
until
the
train
arrived
so
i
opened
up
on
an
old
fish
box
and
soon
had
them
guessing
for
the
baby
ticket
one
fellow
wanted
to
bet
a
dollar
so
i
put
up
and
he
won
another
put
up
and
he
won
then
i
pulled
out
a
roll
and
offered
to
bet
them
against
their
entire
lot
of
ducks
that
they
could
not
turn
the
baby
ticket
they
all
talked
french
to
each
other
for
a
while
and
then
told
me
they
would
take
me
up
i
told
them
to
put
their
ducks
all
up
beside
the
box
and
i
would
put
up
the
they
did
so
and
all
pointed
to
the
same
card
so
i
told
them
to
turn
it
over
one
of
them
did
so
but
it
was
not
the
card
they
wanted
or
thought
it
was
so
they
lost
their
ducks
the
train
arrived
i
got
my
ducks
into
the
and
went
to
the
city
i
had
the
game
hauled
up
to
a
restaurant
and
sent
for
a
lot
of
my
friends
and
i
gave
them
all
the
ducks
they
wanted
i
sold
some
and
had
some
cooked
for
myself
and
my
friends
all
the
boys
heard
of
my
good
luck
some
of
them
wanted
to
borrow
my
gun
while
others
wanted
to
go
out
with
me
the
next
time
i
went
hunting
and
there
were
some
of
the
boys
who
knew
me
very
well
who
said
devol
did
not
shoot
a
single
one
of
those
ducks
he
either
bought
or
won
them
i
insisted
that
i
shot
every
one
and
as
the
frenchmen
did
not
know
me
none
of
my
friends
ever
knew
that
i
won
them
on
the
baby
ticket
quick
work
i
went
fishing
one
day
out
on
lake
pontchartrain
and
caught
a
large
string
of
fine
fish
when
i
got
back
to
the
hotel
i
sent
an
invitation
to
some
of
my
city
friends
to
drive
out
that
evening
and
join
me
in
a
fish
supper
they
accepted
the
invitation
and
were
all
on
hand
at
the
appointed
time
we
were
seated
around
a
table
enjoying
ourselves
drinking
wine
and
telling
stories
while
waiting
for
supper
when
we
heard
quite
a
noise
down
stairs
in
the
direction
of
the
i
told
my
friends
to
remain
seated
and
have
some
more
wine
while
i
went
down
and
inquired
into
the
cause
of
the
racket
they
did
so
and
i
ran
down
to
the
looking
in
i
saw
ten
or
twelve
steamboat
cooks
who
were
on
a
big
drunk
they
were
breaking
glasses
fussing
with
the
barkeeper
and
raising
old
ned
generally
i
knew
some
of
them
but
as
they
were
all
pretty
drunk
i
concluded
i
could
do
no
good
and
was
just
turning
away
to
go
back
to
my
friends
when
four
or
five
union
officers
and
a
man
by
the
name
of
dave
curtis
came
up
and
started
into
the
they
saw
and
recognized
me
and
insisted
on
me
joining
them
we
all
went
in
and
were
taking
a
drink
when
the
cooks
began
their
racket
again
one
fellow
was
just
spoiling
for
a
fight
he
was
a
bully
and
had
whipped
some
of
his
associates
so
no
one
seemed
to
want
anything
to
do
with
him
like
most
drunken
men
he
wanted
everybody
to
know
what
a
great
man
he
was
so
he
began
on
us
we
requested
him
to
go
away
and
join
his
friends
but
he
would
not
do
it
so
finally
i
said
that
fellow
must
have
a
fight
or
he
will
get
sick
then
i
told
him
i
would
let
him
try
his
hand
on
me
if
he
was
sure
he
could
lick
any
man
in
the
room
he
came
at
me
made
a
feint
with
his
left
and
then
let
drive
with
his
right
i
dropped
down
ran
under
and
had
him
on
his
back
before
he
knew
what
i
was
doing
then
i
gave
him
just
one
with
that
old
head
of
mine
and
i
broke
every
bone
in
his
nose
he
yelled
like
an
indian
then
i
let
him
up
his
friends
or
companions
did
not
offer
to
interfere
in
his
behalf
so
i
expect
they
were
very
glad
to
see
him
get
licked
so
easy
and
so
very
quick
for
it
was
all
over
in
much
less
time
than
it
takes
me
to
tell
the
story
i
took
another
drink
with
the
union
officers
and
then
hurried
up
stairs
to
my
friends
whom
i
had
left
waiting
for
their
fish
supper
they
asked
me
what
was
the
cause
of
the
noise
down
stairs
and
i
told
them
it
was
a
lot
of
drunken
cooks
i
said
nothing
about
having
had
a
fight
and
they
did
not
know
anything
about
it
until
we
all
went
down
stairs
when
some
one
spoke
to
me
about
the
nose
being
all
broken
etc
then
they
asked
me
when
i
had
a
fight
i
told
them
while
we
were
waiting
for
supper
they
thought
it
was
pretty
quick
work
to
raise
a
fuss
and
whip
a
good
cook
while
another
cook
was
frying
some
fish
a
hard
head
in
most
all
of
the
many
fights
that
i
have
been
engaged
in
i
made
use
of
what
i
have
called
that
old
head
of
mine
i
do
know
and
i
guess
i
never
will
while
i
alive
just
how
thick
my
old
skull
is
but
i
do
know
it
must
be
pretty
thick
or
it
would
have
been
cracked
many
years
ago
for
i
have
been
struck
some
terrible
blows
on
my
head
with
iron
pokers
clubs
and
bowlders
which
would
have
split
any
man
skull
wide
open
unless
it
was
pretty
thick
doctors
have
often
told
me
that
my
skull
was
nearly
an
inch
in
thickness
over
my
forehead
they
were
only
guessing
at
it
then
of
course
but
if
my
dear
old
law
do
guard
my
grave
they
will
know
after
i
am
dead
sure
enough
for
i
have
heard
them
say
so
for
ten
or
fifteen
years
during
my
early
life
the
sporting
men
of
the
south
tried
to
find
a
man
to
whip
me
but
they
could
do
it
and
finally
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
after
they
gave
up
trying
to
have
me
whipped
and
they
knew
more
about
my
old
head
they
would
all
go
broke
that
i
could
whip
or
kill
any
man
living
white
or
black
by
butting
him
i
have
had
to
do
some
hard
butting
in
my
early
days
on
account
of
the
reputation
i
had
made
for
my
head
i
am
now
nearly
sixty
years
of
age
and
have
quit
fighting
but
i
can
batter
down
any
ordinary
door
or
stave
in
a
liquor
barrel
with
that
old
head
of
mine
and
i
do
believe
there
is
a
man
living
of
near
my
own
age
who
can
whip
me
in
a
fight
i
never
have
my
hair
clipped
short
for
if
i
did
i
would
be
ashamed
to
take
my
hat
off
as
the
lines
on
my
old
scalp
look
about
like
the
railroad
map
of
the
state
in
which
i
was
born
during
the
winter
of
or
john
robinson
circus
was
showing
in
new
orleans
and
they
had
with
them
a
man
by
the
name
of
william
carroll
whom
they
advertised
as
the
man
with
the
thick
skull
or
the
great
butter
he
could
anything
in
the
show
except
the
elephant
one
night
after
the
show
al
and
gill
robinson
were
up
town
and
their
man
carroll
was
with
them
we
all
met
in
a
saloon
and
began
drinking
wine
while
we
were
enjoying
ourselves
something
was
said
about
butting
when
gill
spoke
up
and
said
carroll
could
kill
any
man
in
the
world
with
his
head
dutch
jake
one
of
the
big
sporting
men
of
new
orleans
was
in
the
party
and
he
was
up
in
an
instant
and
said
what
that
i
bet
or
that
i
can
find
a
man
he
ca
kill
or
whip
either
i
knew
what
was
up
and
as
we
were
all
friends
i
did
not
want
to
change
the
social
to
a
butting
match
so
i
said
boys
do
bet
and
carroll
and
i
will
come
together
just
once
for
fun
the
robinson
boys
had
great
confidence
in
carroll
and
so
did
dutch
jake
have
in
me
i
was
at
least
fifty
pounds
heavier
than
carroll
and
i
knew
that
was
a
great
advantage
even
if
his
head
was
as
hard
as
my
own
it
was
finally
agreed
that
there
would
be
no
betting
so
we
came
together
i
did
not
strike
my
very
best
for
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
hurting
the
little
fellow
but
then
he
traveled
on
his
head
so
i
thought
i
could
give
him
a
pretty
good
one
after
we
struck
carroll
walked
up
to
me
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
and
said
gentlemen
i
have
found
my
papa
at
last
he
had
the
hardest
head
i
ever
ran
against
and
if
he
had
been
as
heavy
as
i
was
i
ca
say
what
the
result
would
have
been
if
we
had
come
together
in
earnest
poor
fellow
he
is
dead
now
and
i
know
of
no
other
man
with
as
hard
a
head
except
it
is
myself
my
old
head
is
hard
and
thick
and
maybe
that
is
the
reason
i
never
had
sense
enough
to
save
my
money
it
is
said
of
me
that
i
have
won
more
money
than
any
sporting
man
in
this
country
i
will
say
that
i
had
sense
enough
to
keep
it
but
if
i
had
never
seen
a
faro
bank
i
would
be
a
wealthy
man
saved
by
his
wife
i
shall
never
forget
a
trip
that
i
took
many
years
ago
in
the
steamer
a
pittsburg
boat
it
was
her
first
trip
out
and
adam
clark
who
has
now
been
dead
for
many
years
was
with
me
as
a
partner
he
was
doing
the
playing
and
money
was
plenty
clark
was
an
englishman
and
when
he
spread
his
board
in
the
way
and
made
his
introductory
speech
a
great
crowd
gathered
about
for
as
he
dropped
his
h
like
all
cockneys
it
was
very
amusing
to
hear
him
talk
in
those
days
the
big
fish
had
the
first
choice
and
the
small
fry
or
poor
fish
had
to
wait
around
some
time
before
they
got
a
chance
to
lose
their
money
i
noticed
an
old
man
hanging
around
and
so
i
sized
him
up
as
a
pretty
solid
fellow
and
giving
my
partner
the
wink
i
called
up
all
hands
to
the
bar
and
they
all
came
willingly
enough
except
a
couple
of
fellows
who
hung
back
i
sent
one
of
the
crowd
back
to
invite
them
up
as
i
did
not
want
them
to
see
what
the
old
man
lost
they
came
along
and
while
we
were
at
the
bar
adam
downed
his
man
for
at
one
bet
when
we
came
back
from
the
bar
adam
kept
right
on
playing
as
if
nothing
had
happened
using
the
same
cards
with
the
corner
turned
up
when
the
poor
fish
saw
this
they
all
wanted
to
play
so
i
said
boys
let
make
up
a
pony
purse
and
give
him
a
good
bet
this
was
readily
agreed
to
and
when
i
asked
adam
what
was
the
least
he
would
turn
for
he
said
i
was
pretty
sure
there
was
not
that
amount
of
money
in
the
party
but
i
remarked
that
i
would
go
half
of
it
then
a
little
old
man
said
he
would
put
up
the
rest
chipped
in
and
was
raised
i
put
up
the
balance
and
we
were
all
ready
to
turn
when
down
the
cabin
rushed
a
woman
squealing
like
a
stuck
pig
adam
looked
up
and
the
little
woman
grabbed
the
old
man
and
shouted
where
my
money
give
me
my
money
of
course
such
a
commotion
aroused
all
the
passengers
on
the
boat
who
were
anxious
to
see
what
the
trouble
was
i
got
the
old
lady
to
one
side
and
when
she
cooled
off
a
little
she
said
that
she
had
in
her
dress
pocket
and
had
lain
down
to
sleep
that
when
she
awoke
she
found
her
money
gone
and
knew
no
one
had
taken
it
but
her
husband
as
he
had
done
such
a
trick
before
i
knew
he
was
gambling
she
said
adam
counted
out
the
and
handed
it
back
to
the
old
man
and
said
that
settles
it
i
wo
take
the
bet
somebody
turned
the
card
for
the
balance
and
of
course
adam
won
at
another
time
a
man
lost
a
few
hundred
dollars
and
then
went
back
and
got
the
keys
of
his
wife
trunk
and
securing
some
jewelry
and
a
fine
shawl
sold
them
to
a
passenger
and
receiving
the
money
came
around
and
lost
it
after
the
game
was
all
over
i
learned
of
the
occurrence
and
going
to
the
party
who
had
purchased
the
goods
i
made
him
disgorge
and
paid
him
what
he
paid
for
them
taking
the
goods
and
wrapping
them
up
in
a
paper
i
handed
them
to
the
lady
at
the
same
time
i
advised
her
to
keep
her
keys
from
her
husband
and
have
no
doubt
she
was
very
grateful
to
me
for
it
for
she
seemed
to
be
i
did
not
want
the
lady
to
lose
her
jewelry
and
shawl
for
i
have
noticed
that
a
man
who
will
gamble
away
all
his
money
and
then
steal
his
wife
money
jewelry
or
clothes
to
raise
a
stake
is
not
the
man
to
replace
what
he
has
stolen
in
any
great
hurry
cold
steel
we
got
aboard
of
captain
charles
blunt
boat
at
omaha
bound
for
louis
mo
we
played
our
games
during
the
trip
without
anything
of
notice
occurring
until
we
made
a
landing
at
a
wood
station
about
twenty
miles
above
joseph
mo
it
was
a
lonely
place
in
the
woods
with
nothing
but
long
to
make
it
a
desirable
place
to
stop
over
night
at
there
had
been
some
trouble
between
the
who
were
mostly
irishmen
and
some
of
the
officers
of
the
boat
so
the
former
chose
this
lonely
spot
to
settle
the
matter
after
loading
the
wood
they
all
armed
themselves
with
clubs
and
bowlders
and
took
possession
of
the
stairway
swearing
that
no
man
should
come
down
on
deck
or
let
go
the
line
until
their
wrongs
were
righted
captain
blunt
was
a
brave
man
and
did
not
like
to
be
forced
to
do
anything
against
his
own
free
will
but
he
did
not
know
just
how
to
manage
those
fellows
for
they
were
a
bad
crowd
and
had
the
advantage
of
him
in
numbers
besides
he
had
no
arms
on
board
except
a
few
pistols
and
he
knew
that
an
irishman
did
not
fear
gunpowder
finally
i
said
to
the
captain
if
you
will
take
my
advice
we
can
soon
run
those
fellows
ashore
and
then
we
can
cut
the
line
and
leave
them
he
asked
me
what
i
would
do
so
i
told
him
to
get
all
the
butcher
knives
in
the
kitchen
and
everything
else
on
board
that
would
cut
or
looked
like
it
would
and
arm
the
officers
and
passengers
and
we
would
charge
down
the
steps
on
to
the
fellows
he
thought
it
a
good
plan
so
we
were
soon
ready
i
wanted
the
largest
knife
telling
the
captain
i
would
lead
if
he
would
let
me
have
it
he
wanted
the
glory
of
leading
the
attack
himself
so
i
had
hard
work
to
get
the
largest
one
but
i
did
get
one
about
fifteen
inches
long
we
all
rushed
out
of
the
cabin
and
down
the
steps
with
a
and
before
the
had
time
to
rally
we
were
onto
them
cutting
right
and
left
we
did
not
want
to
kill
we
only
wanted
to
scare
them
i
got
a
lick
on
the
head
it
did
not
hurt
but
it
made
me
mad
and
i
cut
two
or
three
fellows
across
the
part
that
they
sit
down
on
and
they
began
to
yell
cold
steel
and
made
a
rush
for
the
plank
the
others
followed
and
were
in
such
a
hurry
they
did
not
take
time
to
find
the
plank
but
jumped
overboard
and
waded
out
some
one
cut
the
line
and
we
were
soon
away
from
shore
the
captain
told
the
pilot
to
hold
the
boat
and
then
he
told
the
if
they
would
come
on
board
and
behave
themselves
he
would
take
them
to
joseph
they
promised
they
would
not
raise
any
more
disturbance
so
he
took
them
on
board
and
we
started
on
our
way
soon
after
starting
some
one
told
the
captain
that
the
were
talking
about
having
me
arrested
when
we
got
to
joseph
so
he
put
me
ashore
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
and
when
he
was
through
with
his
business
at
joseph
he
came
over
after
me
and
took
me
to
louis
we
landed
alongside
of
the
steamer
a
short
distance
below
joseph
captain
blunt
went
over
on
board
and
told
the
officers
all
about
our
gallant
charge
my
old
friend
henry
mange
who
keeps
a
boat
store
in
new
orleans
was
running
the
bar
on
the
at
the
time
and
he
often
asks
me
about
the
war
on
the
missouri
river
rattlesnake
jack
rattlesnake
jack
was
about
the
last
man
i
worked
with
as
a
partner
playing
monte
his
right
name
was
jackson
mcgee
he
was
born
and
raised
in
the
mountains
of
virginia
and
spent
much
of
his
early
life
catching
snakes
which
he
would
sell
to
showmen
who
gave
him
the
name
of
rattlesnake
jack
he
was
over
fifty
years
of
age
and
weighed
about
pounds
at
the
time
he
and
i
worked
together
he
was
a
good
talker
and
had
but
few
equals
at
throwing
the
three
cards
he
looked
like
the
greenest
sort
of
a
backwoodsman
when
he
had
his
on
he
was
not
the
bravest
man
in
the
world
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
snakes
and
could
make
some
good
big
bluffs
with
his
long
he
is
now
living
in
west
virginia
with
his
family
and
no
one
would
think
to
see
him
that
he
used
to
catch
rattlesnakes
for
a
living
or
played
monte
with
old
devol
he
has
a
beautiful
daughter
who
is
highly
accomplished
and
jack
is
proud
of
her
old
jack
and
i
were
on
board
of
the
steamer
one
saturday
night
coming
out
of
new
orleans
and
she
had
a
large
number
of
passengers
on
board
we
did
not
see
any
good
monte
suckers
so
i
opened
up
a
game
of
and
did
a
fair
business
until
then
i
closed
up
and
went
to
the
bar
where
i
met
a
gentleman
i
had
often
seen
on
the
packets
he
knew
me
and
my
business
for
he
had
seen
me
play
monte
several
times
he
invited
me
to
join
him
in
a
drink
and
then
laughingly
said
devol
how
is
the
old
business
anyway
i
laughed
back
saying
oh
it
just
but
let
take
another
drink
he
accepted
and
while
we
were
drinking
old
rattlesnake
jack
walked
up
and
said
to
the
barkeeper
mister

much

barkeeper
told
him

jack

live

can
get
a
dram
for
cents
but

the
barkeeper
set
him
out
a
small
glass
and
a
bottle
jack
looked
at
the
glass
picked
it
up
and
stuck
his
finger
in
it
then
set
it
down
and
said

little
thing

filled
the
glass
full
saying
up
whar
i
live
they
give
you
a
tin
cup
when
you
take
a
dram
he
pulled
out
a
roll
about
the
size
of
a
boarding
house
pillow
to
pay
for
the
drink
and
the
smallest
bill
he
had
was
that
made
my
friend
open
his
eyes
and
he
whispered
to
me
devol

the

a
good
big
one
as
the
old
fellow
was
getting
too
drunk
to
handle
his
cards
and
he
might
fall
over
and
stop
the
game
my
friend
then
ordered
the
drinks
thinking
no
doubt
that
if
he
would
treat
old
jack
would
bet
more
liberally
with
him
when
the
bystanders
saw
jack
take
another
of
those
big
drams
some
of
them
remarked
those
gamblers
have
that
old
fellow
so
drunk
they
will
win
all
of
his
money
before
they
let
him
go
it
a
shame
and
we

my
friend
offered
to
bet
when
old
jack
said

the
table
and

i
whispered
to
my
friend
telling
him
that

i
asked
jack
how

he

in
the
roll
he
said

i

so
i
reckon

nigh
onto
i
requested
one
of
the
bystanders
to
count
the
money
which
he
did
and
found
it
to
be
just
my
friend
had
and
i
put
up
the
balance
i
told
him
to
turn
the
card
as
he
had
up
the
most
old
jack
mixed
them
up
but
he
was
so
drunk
he
could
hardly
pick
up
a
card
my
friend
could
hardly
wait
for
jack
to
say
ready
before
he
dove
in
and
grabbed
the
one
with
the
spot
on
it
but
when
he
turned
it
over
he
saw
it
was
not
the
one
with
the
boy
on
it
old
jack
snatched
the
money
from
the
gentleman
that
was
holding
stakes
and
shoved
it
down
into
his
pockets
then
turning
to
the
crowd
he
said
wall
why
do
yer
laugh
now
they
did
laugh
for
most
of
them
felt
like
it
old
jack
joined
in
and
laughed
louder
than
any
of
them
and
then
turning
around
to
the
table
he
began
looking
for
his
precious
tickets
he
had
put
them
in
his
pocket
without
any
one
seeing
him
but
pretended
he
was
ruined
if
he
could
not
find
them
i
told
him
the
barkeeper
had
some
just
like
them
and
i
would
go
and
get
them
for
him
that
quieted
him
down

when
he
saw
them
saying
wall
i
be
if
they
haint
just
like
i
gave
jack
the
new
set
but
i
turned
up
a
corner
on
the
boy
card
so
every
one

see
it
then
i
told
him
to
mix
them
up
and
i
would
make
him
a
bet
of
a
we
put
up
the
money
i
turned
and
won
then
the
bystanders
began
to
take
more
interest
in
the
game
than
ever
and
the
fun
began
again
one
fat
gentleman
crowded
in
and
wanted
to
bet
i
said
boys

us
make
up
a
pony
purse
and
we
will
all
bet
on
the
same
card
my
friend
wanted
to
get
into
the
same
party
but
did
not
have
any
ready
cash
so
he
asked
me
for
a
loan
offering
his
watch
and
diamond
as
security
i
let
him
have
which
he
put
up
the
fat
gent
put
up
and
another
man
put
in
i
put
up
which
made
the
purse
old
jack
was
very
drunk
but
he
got
up
his
money
someway
and
then
began
to
mix
we
picked
on
the
fat
gentleman
to
do
the
turning
he
took
his
time
as
most
fat
men
do
but
when
he
turned
the
card
it
was
the
wrong
one
so
we
lost
all
our
money
just
then
some
one
yelled
out
sold
again
and
got
the
money
that
broke
up
the
little
game
and
old
jack
said
boys
come
and
take
a
dram
with
me
and
then
i
go
to
bed
we
all
went
to
the
bar
and
when
jack
took
his
big
dram
i
noticed
that
he
drank
out
of
a
different
bottle
from
the
rest
of
us
he
then
went
to
his
room
and
in
a
short
time
i
went
to
look
for
him
but
i
did
not
find
him
in
his
room
he
was
up
in
the
texas
eating
up
the
officers
lunch
my
friend
said
he
would
send
me
the
money
to
redeem
his
jewelry
by
the
barkeeper
the
next
trip
as
i
had
downed
him
for
in
cash
i
gave
him
his
jewelry
on
his
promise
he
did
not
keep
it
and
well
i
knew
he
would
not
the
next
time
i
met
him
he
said
nothing
about
the
so
i
told
him
he
did
not
owe
me
anything
as
i
got
of
what
he
lost
and
that
i
had
sent
out
west
and
got
rattlesnake
jack
on
purpose
to
down
him
at
the
old
game
that
he
knew
so
well
that
made
him
mad
and
he
would
never
speak
to
me
after
that
and

change
of
conductors
before
we
could
open
up
for
business
i
gave
jack
the
office
to
come
up
which
he
did
looking
like
a
texas
ranchman
the
had
been
to

to

his
critters
and

oh
my
dear
tommy
tommy
i
will
never
see
you
any
more
jack
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
handed
his
thomas
cat
over
to
the
lady
first
she
smiled
then
she
laughed
and
then
she
said
hubby
get
out
your
bottle
and
give
this
dear
good
nice
gentleman
a
drink
the
passengers
all
roared
again
jack
took
a
drink
the
train
rolled
into
the
depot
we
all
bid
the
lady
and
gentleman
and
tommy
and
got
off
selah
kickers
all
men
that
bet
should
not
be
classed
as
gamblers
for
some
that
style
themselves
will
bet
to
win
of
course
and
kick
if
they
lose
which
a
gambler
will
never
do
although
he
may
sometimes
be
sucker
enough
to
bet
to
win
against
a
sure
thing
like
old
monte
or
a
brace
game
a
kicker
or
squealer
always
speaks
of
the
money
he
has
lost
against
any
game
as
his
money
while
the
gambler
considers
the
money
he
loses
against
any
game
as
lost
and
it
belongs
to
the
person
who
won
it
and
you
never
hear
one
of
them
do
any
kicking
old
rattlesnake
and
i
left
new
orleans
one
evening
on
the
steamer
we
played
the
good
old
game
in
the
usual
way
and
caught
quite
a
number
of
good
sized
suckers
among
which
was
one
from
joseph
la
we
got
off
at
baton
rouge
and
took
another
boat
back
to
new
orleans
the
next
trip
we
made
on
the
we
learned
from
my
old
friend
carnahan
the
steward
that
the
joseph
sucker
whom
we
had
downed
on
the
last
trip
made
a
big
kick
when
he
learned
that
we
had
left
the
boat
at
baton
rouge
he
said
he
would
get
a
lot
of
the
joseph
boys
go
back
to
where
we
got
off
and
make
us
give
up
his
money
or
he
would
kill
us
the
steward
told
him
not
to
do
it
for
said
he
those
fellows
are
bad
men
to
fool
with
i
have
seen
twenty
suckers
try
to
make
them
give
up
but
i
never
saw
them
do
it
as
we
were
not
within
miles
of
this
kicker
who
i
have
no
doubt
styled
himself
a
man
of
course
he
could
do
a
great
deal
of
blowing
but
when
a
short
time
afterwards
we
met
him
with
a
lot
of
joseph
boys
at
his
back
we
could
not
get
within
speaking
distance
of
him
i
was
glad
of
it
as
they
were
a
bad
crowd
old
carnahan
and
i
were
cabin
boys
on
the
same
boat
before
the
mexican
war
he
is
dead
now
but
i
shall
always
remember
him
for
telling
the
kicker
those
fellows
are
bad
men
to
fool
with
old
jack
and
i
traveled
north
during
the
summer
season
playing
the
boats
and
railroad
trains
we
were
going
out
of
detroit
on
the
great
western
railroad
over
into
ontario
one
night
when
there
was
quite
a
number
of
breed
french
and
irish
canadians
on
board
they
had
six
or
seven
with
them
that
had
been
fighting
against
some
dogs
in
detroit
and
from
their
talk
we
learned
that
they
downed
uncle
sam
so
we
thought
as
we
were
americans
that
we
would
try
and
down
them
not
with
but
with
the
good
old
game
jack
was
soon
among
them
and
in
a
short
time
with
my
assistance
as
capper
he
had
downed
several
of
the
canucks
for
a
few
hundred
they
were
kickers
from
the
old
house
they
all
got
together
and
began
cackling
like
a
lot
of
old
hens
when
a
hawk
is
after
them
no
one
but
themselves
could
understand
a
word
they
said
but
they
soon
made
a
rush
for
jack
and
demanded
in
english
that
he
give
up
their
money
or
they
would
kill
him
their
wanted
to
take
part
in
the
fight
and
i
guess
they
would
have
done
it
if
it
had
not
been
for
their
owners
for
if
a
dog
master
runs
he
will
be
sure
to
run
after
him
old
jack
whipped
out
that
big
long
shooter
of
his
and
the
instant
they
saw
it
they
all
started
and
made
a
regular
stampede
for
the
other
car
the
dogs
took
after
their
masters
and
it
was
fun
to
see
the
passengers
climbing
upon
the
seats
the
men
and
the
dogs
rushed
into
the
ladies
car
and
you
would
have
thought
it
was
on
fire
if
you
had
heard
the
screams
and
yells
that
the
passengers
set
up
when
the
men
and
rushed
in
among
them
the
poor
dumb
brutes
were
frightened
as
much
as
their
owners
and
they
set
up
the
d
dest
howl
i
ever
heard
in
all
my
life
we
were
just
nearing
a
station
so
i
told
old
jack
to
drop
off
which
he
did
and
then
he
got
onto
the
hind
sleeper
the
people
at
the
station
had
heard
the
screams
and
came
running
to
see
what
was
the
matter
the
railroad
boys
had
hard
work
to
get
the
dogs
and
men
out
of
the
ladies
car
but
they
could
not
get
one
of
the
dogs
back
into
the
cars
he
had
been
run
out
of
i
did
not
blame
the
brutes
much
for
they
had
been
badly
frightened
we
were
coming
out
of
chicago
at
one
time
on
the
burlington
quincy
railroad
and
had
downed
some
suckers
when
one
of
them
began
to
kick
like
a
bad
mule
he
told
the
conductor
that
old
jack
had
robbed
him
out
of
his
money
the
conductor
told
him
he
could
do
nothing
except
turn
the
gambler
over
to
the
police
at
the
next
station
he
locked
the
doors
to
keep
jack
from
jumping
off
and
the
sucker
quieted
down
thinking
he
would
be
when
he
reached
the
station
i
saw
two
gentlemen
from
quincy
in
the
car
that
i
was
acquainted
with
so
i
wrote
a
note
to
them
requesting
that
they
tell
the
kicker
he
was
in
the
same
boat
with
the
gambler
as
he
would
be
fined
just
as
much
as
the
man
who
got
his
money
and
that
the
fine
in
illinois
was
the
result
was
the
fellow
hid
himself
and
when
the
conductor
pointed
old
jack
out
he
could
not
find
the
kicker
we
got
off
with
the
officers
and
as
no
one
was
on
hand
to
testify
of
course
we
only
had
to
treat
until
the
next
train
arrived
william
jones
canada
bill
canada
bill
peace
to
his
ashes
is
dead
he
died
in
reading
about
ten
years
ago
and
poor
fellow
he
did
not
leave
enough
money
of
all
the
many
thousands
he
had
won
to
bury
him
the
mayor
of
reading
had
him
decently
interred
and
when
his
friends
in
chicago
learned
the
fact
they
raised
money
enough
to
pay
all
the
funeral
expenses
and
erect
a
monument
to
the
memory
of
one
who
was
while
living
a
friend
to
the
poor
i
was
in
new
orleans
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
did
not
hear
the
sad
news
for
some
months
after
i
hope
the
old
fellow
is
happy
in
a
better
land
if
kind
acts
and
a
generous
heart
can
atone
for
the
sin
of
gambling
and
entitle
men
to
a
mansion
in
the
skies
canada
bill
surely
got
one
where
the
wicked
cease
from
troubling
and
the
weary
are
at
rest
there
never
lived
a
better
hearted
man
he
was
liberal
to
a
fault
i
have
known
him
to
turn
back
when
we
were
on
the
street
and
give
to
some
poor
object
we
had
passed
many
a
time
i
have
seen
him
walk
up
to
a
sister
of
charity
and
make
her
a
present
of
as
much
as
and
when
we
would
speak
of
it
he
would
say
well
george
they
do
a
great
deal
for
the
poor
and
i
think
they
know
better
how
to
use
the
money
than
i
do
once
i
saw
him
win
from
a
man
and
shortly
after
his
little
boy
came
running
down
the
cabin
bill
called
the
boy
up
and
handed
him
the
and
told
him
to
give
it
to
his
mother
he
was
a
man
take
him
for
all
in
all
that
possessed
many
laudable
traits
of
character
he
often
said
suckers
had
no
business
with
money
he
had
some
peculiar
traits
while
he
was
a
great
man
at
monte
he
was
a
fool
at
short
cards
i
have
known
men
who
knew
this
to
travel
all
over
the
country
after
bill
trying
to
induce
him
to
play
cards
with
them
he
would
do
it
and
this
is
what
kept
him
poor
mason
long
the
converted
gambler
says
of
william
jones
canada
bill
the
confidence
men
and
monte
players
were
in
clover
among
them
was
the
most
notorious
and
successful
who
ever
operated
in
this
country
canada
bill
he
was
a
man
with
a
nose
by
the
joint
action
of
and
heat
bill
squandered
his
money
very
lavishly
and
himself
to
death
in
about
a
year
after
the
incident
i
have
related
he
died
a
pauper
but
by
all
thy
nature
weakness
hidden
faults
and
follies
know
be
thou
in
rebuking
evil
conscious
of
thine
own
is
mason
long
converted
god
and
himself
only
know
was
he
fully
converted
when
he
wrote
the
converted
gambler
if
the
bible
be
true
and
it
was
left
for
me
to
decide
i
would
answer
in
the
language
of
paul
though
i
speak
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
of
angels
and
have
not
charity
i
am
become
as
sounding
brass
or
a
tinkling
cymbal
a
true
christian
will
exercise
charity
toward
all
offenders
granting
a
boon
of
pity
to
the
erring
and
cast
a
glance
of
mercy
upon
the
faults
of
his
fellows
he
will
cherish
a
recollection
of
his
virtues
and
bury
all
his
imperfections
is
mason
long
a
true
christian
read
his
description
of
canada
bill
then
read
a
true
description
of
bill
personal
appearance
on
page
in
this
book
if
mason
long
had
never
seen
canada
bill
i
would
excuse
him
but
he
said
he
capped
for
him
once
or
at
least
he
tried
to
do
so
has
he
shown
any
christian
charity
in
speaking
of
a
man
in
his
grave
read
what
he
says
and
you
will
see
that
he
or
i
are
mistaken
bill
was
not
a
thief
he
was
honest
to
a
fault
he
was
not
a
large
man
for
he
never
weighed
over
he
did
not
have
a
nose
highly
illuminated
by
the
joint
action
of
whisky
and
heat
he
did
not
drink
himself
to
death
within
a
year
of
for
he
visited
me
in
new
orleans
in
he
did
not
drink
whisky
at
all
his
great
drink
was
christian
cider
and
it
was
very
seldom
i
could
get
him
to
drink
wine
he
did
die
a
pauper
and
god
bless
him
for
it
for
he
gave
more
money
to
the
poor
than
a
thousand
professed
christians
that
i
know
who
make
a
great
parade
of
their
reformation
the
public
put
all
sporting
men
into
one
class
called
gamblers
likewise
they
put
all
church
members
into
classes
and
call
them
christians
etc
there
is
as
wide
a
difference
between
a
true
gambler
and
one
who
styles
himself
a
sport
as
there
is
between
a
true
christian
and
one
who
puts
on
the
cloak
of
christianity
to
serve
the
devil
in
there
is
an
old
saying
honor
among
thieves
i
will
add
a
maxim
or
two
there
is
honor
among
gamblers
and
dishonor
among
some
business
men
that
stand
very
high
in
the
community
in
which
they
live
the
two
judges
he
can
not
essay
to
walk
sedate
but
in
his
very
gait
one
sees
a
jest
that
ready
to
break
out
in
spite
of
all
his
seeming
some
years
ago
judge
smith
was
upon
the
bench
of
the
police
court
at
new
orleans
and
during
the
time
judge
wilson
occupied
the
same
position
at
cincinnati
judge
smith
made
a
trip
to
the
north
one
summer
and
stopped
at
cincinnati
for
a
few
days
on
his
way
home
while
in
the
queen
city
he
formed
the
acquaintance
of
judge
moses
wilson
and
as
he
was
in
the
business
like
himself
he
felt
as
though
they
were
somewhat
akin
judge
smith
was
very
fond
of
a
joke
and
when
he
met
mose
wilson
he
met
a
man
who
had
a
fondness
for
gags
and
was
ever
joking
these
kindred
spirits
were
soon
well
pleased
with
each
other
wilson
felt
that
the
duty
of
entertaining
a
fellow
judge
from
a
sister
city
was
incumbent
upon
him
and
he
just
spread
himself
to
do
it
they
had
a
right
royal
time
together
but
all
things
must
come
to
an
end
some
time
and
the
time
had
come
for
judge
smith
to
tear
himself
away
and
return
once
more
to
the
field
of
his
labor
they
bid
each
other
an
affectionate
but
not
until
after
mose
had
promised
smith
to
visit
him
the
next
winter
and
stay
forevermore
judge
smith
was
at
the
depot
his
baggage
was
on
board
and
he
was
just
stepping
upon
the
platform
when
two
gentlemen
stepped
up
and
one
of
them
said
we
want
you
at
the
same
time
displaying
his
police
badge
what
for
inquired
smith
suspicion
replied
the
officer
gentlemen
you
are
mistaken
i
am
judge
of
the
police
court
of
new
orleans
oh
you
are
well
we
never
arrest
a
fellow
like
you
that
he
is
not
a
judge
lawyer
doctor
or
some
big
bug
somewhere
to
hear
him
tell
it
but
you
take
a
walk
with
us
up
to
the
chief
office
and
explain
to
him
who
and
what
you
are
smith
saw
it
was
of
no
use
trying
to
explain
the
train
was
moving
off
with
his
baggage
on
board
and
he
was
left
in
the
hands
of
the
two
officers
they
marched
him
up
to
the
chief
office
and
when
they
arrived
everything
seemed
to
be
in
readiness
for
an
immediate
trial
for
there
was
judge
wilson
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
quite
a
number
of
witnesses
smith
was
found
guilty
of
desertion
the
judge
fined
him
a
bottle
and
ordered
that
he
be
confined
within
the
city
limits
for
one
day
smith
paid
the
fine
but
pleaded
to
be
let
off
from
the
imprisonment
judge
wilson
was
firm
for
once
in
his
life
so
poor
smith
had
to
serve
out
his
time
but
the
judge
was
kind
enough
to
see
that
he
did
not
suffer
for
the
want
of
anything
and
when
he
was
set
at
liberty
he
was
like
some
birds
born
and
raised
in
a
cage
they
like
the
confinement
and
when
the
door
is
open
they
will
not
fly
away
but
frighten
the
bird
and
away
it
will
go
it
was
so
with
smith
he
had
already
stayed
too
long
he
got
frightened
and
flew
away
to
the
sunny
south
the
cold
blasts
of
winter
were
sweeping
over
the
north
when
judge
wilson
remembered
his
promise
made
to
judge
smith
to
visit
him
in
new
orleans
and
he
was
soon
on
his
way
to
make
his
promise
good
for
he
is
a
man
of
his
word
he
telegraphed
smith
that
he
would
arrive
on
a
certain
train
expecting
of
course
that
he
would
be
received
with
a
brass
band
etc
the
train
on
which
mose
was
being
transported
from
the
land
of
snow
to
the
land
of
flowers
was
about
ten
miles
from
new
orleans
when
it
passed
a
freight
and
in
a
few
moments
two
large
men
with
brass
buttons
on
their
coats
came
marching
into
the
cincinnati
sleeper
they
came
down
the
aisle
closely
scanning
the
faces
of
all
the
male
passengers
they
halted
at
the
seat
occupied
by
mose
they
looked
at
him
and
then
at
a
photograph
they
had
with
them
finally
one
of
them
put
his
hand
on
mose
shoulder
and
said
we
want
you
the
judge
took
in
the
situation
at
once
for
he
had
not
forgotten
the
time
he
played
a
similar
joke
but
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
all
the
passengers
especially
as
there
were
a
great
many
ladies
on
board
thinking
that
he
was
under
arrest
in
earnest
so
he
smiled
one
of
those
sweet
smiles
of
his
and
said
officers
this
is
all
a
joke
i
am
judge
of
the
police
court
of
cincinnati
and
i
am
well
acquainted
with
the
judge
of
your
court
i
expected
to
be
received
in
new
orleans
with
a
brass
band
in
place
of
brass
buttons
do
yez
hear
that
he
a
judge
of
the
police
court
expected
to
be
received
wid
a
brass
band
why
he
got
more
brass
than
there
is
in
twenty
brass
bands
he
the
biggest
thafe
in
the
whole
country
did
we
see
the
chafe
go
right
straight
to
the
rogue
gallery
and
get
his
picture
and
did
he
tell
pat
and
meself
to
come
out
here
and
arrest
yez
and
did
we
ride
on
a
freight
train
mose
saw
it
was
no
use
trying
to
make
the
officers
or
passengers
understand
that
it
was
a
joke
so
he
said
all
right
i
will
go
with
you
of
course
yez
will
wo
he
pat
you
bet
he
will
says
pat
the
officers
sat
down
facing
him
so
they
could
keep
a
watch
on
him
for
they
were
afraid
he
would
try
to
jump
out
the
window
when
the
train
arrived
at
new
orleans
the
officers
got
a
carriage
at
mose
request
and
they
were
driven
to
the
chief
office
the
chief
pretended
not
to
know
the
honorable
judge
and
told
him
to
send
for
his
friends
he
called
for
an
officer
to
take
mose
down
and
lock
him
up
when
in
walked
judge
smith
mose
smiled
and
said
smith
i
owe
you
one
judge
smith
told
the
chief
he
would
be
responsible
for
mose
while
in
the
city
so
he
let
him
go
there
was
a
carriage
in
waiting
they
got
in
and
were
driven
to
leon
restaurant
where
they
found
a
large
number
of
judge
smith
friends
and
a
fine
dinner
awaiting
them
after
dinner
while
we
were
drinking
to
mose
health
and
smoking
cigars
judge
smith
requested
me
to
show
our
honored
guest
the
baby
ticket
i
did
and
downed
him
for
a
bottle
but
it
did
not
cost
him
a
cent
for
his
queen
city
money
was
no
good
in
the
crescent
city
so
long
as
he
remained
with
the
judge
for
they
were
kindred
spirits
tapped
the
till
it
is
often
said
that
faro
banks
are
never
broke
but
i
recall
one
incident
that
will
prove
the
contrary
it
was
during
the
war
and
a
number
of
us
were
playing
together
at
new
orleans
at
charlie
bush
my
old
partner
they
were
all
high
rollers
and
when
one
of
them
who
was
a
big
loser
went
to
get
his
checks
cashed
for
the
cashier
pulled
out
the
drawer
and
found
that
the
bottom
had
been
cut
out
and
all
the
money
was
gone
some
snoozer
had
crawled
under
the
table
and
with
a
sharp
knife
cut
the
bottom
clear
out
of
course
the
proprietors
were
very
mad
but
the
joke
was
such
a
good
one
that
it
would
keep
still
in
spite
of
all
this
i
had
rather
deposit
my
money
in
faro
banks
than
the
fidelity
of
cincinnati
and
i
guess
all
honest
citizens
feel
the
same
way
a
square
game
i
met
a
man
in
a
saloon
one
night
at
cincinnati
he
was
a
stranger
and
he
inquired
of
me
if
i
knew
of
a
good
big
poker
game
i
told
him
there
were
no
public
games
running
at
that
time
that
most
of
the
hotels
had
games
but
they
were
private
we
took
a
drink
or
two
together
and
he
again
remarked
that
he
would
like
a
game
i
invited
him
to
my
room
and
we
had
a
nice
square
game
from
that
time
until
morning
i
won
from
him
and
as
he
was
about
broke
i
invited
him
to
take
breakfast
with
me
after
we
had
finished
breakfast
and
were
smoking
our
cigars
he
began
to
kick
i
told
him
if
he
was
that
kind
of
a
man
i
would
never
play
with
him
any
more
i
left
him
and
went
to
bed
i
got
up
in
the
afternoon
and
went
out
on
the
street
when
i
saw
my
poker
friend
in
company
with
detective
steve
mead
then
i
knew
he
was
a
kicker
sure
enough
mead
told
me
the
chief
wanted
to
see
me
so
we
started
for
his
office
on
our
way
up
central
avenue
we
stopped
to
get
a
drink
i
thought
i
could
trust
the
barkeeper
so
i
just
threw
a
roll
over
behind
the
counter
and
was
then
ready
to
see
his
honor
the
chief
asked
me
if
i
won
the
man
money
i
told
him
i
did
but
said
chief
woods
he
said
you
cheated
him
i
replied
why
chief
how
could
i
a
man
that
knows
but
very
little
about
cards
cheat
an
old
gambler
like
this
fellow
i
no
gambler
replied
the
kicker
the
chief
asked
mead
what
he
had
learned
and
he
said
they
were
playing
a
square
game
of
poker
that
settles
it
said
the
chief
so
i
walked
out
and
down
to
where
i
had
left
my
roll
the
looking
young
man
handed
it
over
and
since
then
i
have
always
thought
billy
gruber
was
an
honest
man
and
deserved
to
own
two
of
the
finest
saloons
in
the
queen
city
a
coward
while
in
chicago
playing
the
bank
one
day
i
had
some
angry
words
with
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
john
lawler
and
i
slapped
him
in
the
face
he
did
not
resent
it
but
went
out
about
in
the
afternoon
i
cashed
in
my
checks
and
started
to
my
room
i
was
walking
down
clark
street
and
was
near
the
corner
of
madison
when
this
fellow
lawler
stepped
out
and
began
firing
at
me
the
first
shot
would
have
hit
me
in
the
breast
if
i
had
not
thrown
up
my
arm
as
it
was
it
struck
me
on
the
wristbone
and
ran
up
my
arm
near
the
shoulder
after
the
coward
fired
he
began
running
backward
and
kept
it
up
until
he
had
fired
all
six
shots
i
had
nothing
but
a
little
cane
but
i
started
after
him
and
just
as
he
fired
the
last
shot
i
struck
him
with
my
good
arm
and
downed
him
i
was
onto
him
and
was
just
getting
that
old
head
of
mine
ready
when
the
police
arrested
me
there
were
thousands
of
people
on
the
street
but
you
could
not
see
a
cop
until
the
last
shot
was
fired
the
fellow
was
sent
up
for
three
years
and
i
signed
a
petition
to
get
him
out
i
was
mad
when
he
shot
me
and
i
guess
i
would
have
killed
him
if
they
had
not
taken
me
off
but
i
do
not
hold
malice
to
any
one
not
even
if
he
tries
to
kill
me
i
was
laid
up
for
some
time
with
my
arm
the
bullet
was
cut
out
and
was
as
flat
as
a
i
went
from
chicago
to
paul
to
see
my
dear
old
mother
and
a
sister
who
were
living
there
at
that
time
my
arm
is
as
strong
as
ever
or
at
least
some
fellows
who
have
felt
it
since
say
so
reduced
the
price
no
one
knows
the
difficulty
that
a
man
experiences
who
having
been
a
gambler
for
a
long
period
of
years
suddenly
resolves
to
change
his
course
lead
a
new
life
engage
in
a
different
business
and
make
a
new
man
out
of
himself
it
is
all
very
well
for
moralists
to
say
that
all
that
is
needed
is
there
is
something
else
i
well
remember
once
that
i
resolved
to
leave
the
business
it
was
when
i
was
living
in
vicksburg
i
saw
an
opportunity
to
start
a
beer
garden
i
rented
a
house
and
furnished
it
up
in
fine
style
and
stocked
it
up
with
liquors
and
cigars
my
friends
were
glad
to
see
this
course
i
had
taken
and
promised
to
encourage
me
they
did
so
and
i
could
not
complain
for
a
lack
of
patronage
beer
i
sold
at
five
cents
a
glass
and
as
everybody
before
had
been
charging
ten
cents
i
soon
secured
a
large
patronage
when
the
boats
landed
at
the
wharf
the
passengers
and
crew
all
came
up
and
paid
the
garden
a
visit
did
i
succeed
in
my
new
undertaking
no
of
course
i
did
not
the
all
combined
and
kicked
against
me
because
i
had
reduced
the
price
of
beer
two
of
them
were
members
of
the
city
council
and
two
more
of
the
board
of
aldermen
they
sent
spies
to
see
if
i
sold
liquor
to
minors
but
being
unable
to
detect
me
they
resolved
that
i
should
not
have
a
license
i
had
taken
out
my
united
states
revenue
license
i
was
compelled
to
sell
out
at
a
great
sacrifice
and
all
my
efforts
at
reform
were
unavailing
general
remarks
when
a
sucker
sees
a
corner
turned
up
or
a
little
spot
on
a
card
in
monte
he
does
not
know
that
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
making
him
think
he
has
the
advantage
he
thinks
of
course
the
player
does
not
see
it
and
he
is
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
out
his
money
that
he
often
cuts
or
tears
his
clothes
he
feels
like
he
is
going
to
steal
the
money
from
a
blind
man
but
he
does
not
care
he
will
win
it
and
say
nothing
about
how
he
did
it
after
they
have
put
up
their
money
and
turned
the
card
they
see
that
the
mark
was
put
there
for
a
purpose
then
they
are
mad
because
they
are
beat
at
their
own
game
they
begin
to
kick
and
want
their
money
back
but
they
would
not
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
had
they
won
the
money
from
a
blind
man
for
they
did
think
he
must
be
nearly
blind
or
he
could
have
seen
the
mark
on
the
winning
card
they
expected
to
rob
a
blind
man
and
got
left
i
never
had
any
sympathy
for
them
and
i
would
fight
before
i
would
give
them
back
one
cent
it
is
a
good
lesson
for
a
dishonest
man
to
be
caught
by
some
trick
and
i
always
did
like
to
teach
it
i
have
had
the
right
card
turned
on
me
for
big
money
by
suckers
but
it
was
an
accident
for
they
were
so
much
excited
that
they
did
not
get
the
card
they
were
after
i
have
also
given
a
big
hand
in
poker
to
a
sucker
and
had
him
to
knock
the
ginger
out
of
me
but
this
would
make
me
more
careful
in
the
future
i
seen
suckers
win
a
small
amount
and
then
run
all
over
the
boat
telling
how
they
downed
the
gambler
but
they
were
almost
sure
to
come
back
and
lose
much
more
than
they
had
won
i
have
often
given
a
sucker
back
his
money
and
i
have
seen
them
lose
it
with
my
partner
or
at
some
other
game
on
the
same
boat
i
have
won
hundreds
of
thousands
from
thieves
who
were
making
tracks
for
some
other
country
to
keep
out
of
jail
and
to
spend
their
gotten
gains
i
enjoyed
beating
a
man
that
was
loaded
down
with
stolen
money
more
than
any
one
else
i
always
felt
as
if
it
was
my
duty
to
try
and
keep
the
money
in
our
own
country
young
men
and
boys
have
often
stood
around
the
table
and
bothered
me
to
bet
i
would
tell
them
to
go
away
that
i
did
not
gamble
with
boys
that
would
make
some
of
the
smart
alecks
mad
and
they
would
make
a
great
deal
of
noise
so
when
i
was
about
to
close
up
i
would
take
in
the
young
chap
he
would
walk
away
with
a
good
lesson
but
when
i
had
to
win
money
from
a
boy
to
keep
him
quiet
i
would
always
go
to
him
and
return
the
money
after
giving
him
a
good
talking
to
i
meet
good
business
men
very
often
now
that
take
me
by
the
hand
and
remind
me
of
when
i
won
some
money
from
them
when
they
were
boys
and
returned
it
with
a
good
lecture
i
have
sometimes
wished
i
had
part
of
what
i
have
returned
to
boys
and
suckers
for
then
i
would
have
enough
to
keep
me
the
balance
of
my
life
i
had
the
niggers
all
along
the
coast
so
trained
that
they
would
call
me
massa
when
i
would
get
on
or
off
a
boat
if
i
was
waiting
at
a
landing
i
would
post
some
old
nig
what
to
say
when
i
went
on
board
so
while
the
passengers
were
all
out
on
the
guards
and
i
was
bidding
the
coons
my
nig
would
cry
out
massa
george
i
goin
to
take
good
care
of
the
old
plantation
till
you
comes
back
i
would
go
on
board
with
one
of
the
niggers
carrying
my
bags
and
those
sucker
passengers
would
think
i
was
a
planter
sure
enough
so
if
a
game
was
proposed
i
had
no
trouble
to
get
into
it
as
all
who
play
cards
are
looking
for
suckers
that
they
know
have
money
and
who
in
those
old
times
had
more
money
than
a
southern
planter
i
have
often
stepped
up
to
the
bar
as
soon
as
i
would
get
on
board
and
treat
every
one
within
call
and
when
i
would
pay
for
the
drinks
i
would
pull
out
a
roll
that
would
make
everybody
look
wild
then
i
was
sure
to
get
into
the
first
game
that
would
be
started
for
all
wanted
a
part
of
the
planter
roll
i
have
downed
planters
and
many
good
business
men
who
would
come
to
me
afterwards
and
want
to
stand
in
with
my
play
and
many
are
the
thousands
i
have
divided
with
them
and
yet
the
truly
good
people
never
class
such
men
among
gamblers
the
world
is
full
of
such
men
they
are
not
brave
enough
to
take
the
name
but
they
are
always
ready
for
a
part
of
the
game
a
gambler
word
is
as
good
as
his
bond
and
that
is
more
than
i
can
say
of
many
business
men
who
stand
very
high
in
a
community
i
would
rather
take
a
true
gambler
word
than
the
bond
of
many
business
men
who
are
counted
worth
thousands
the
gambler
will
pay
when
he
has
money
which
many
good
church
members
will
not
ancient
gambling
hobbes
the
philosopher
says
man
is
the
only
animal
that
laughs
he
might
have
appropriately
added
he
is
the
only
animal
that
gambles
to
gamble
or
venture
on
chance
his
own
property
with
the
hope
of
winning
the
property
of
another
is
peculiar
to
him

animals
in

man
will
fight
for
meat
drink
and
lodging
and
will
battle
for
love
as
fiercely
as
the
old
knights
of
chivalry
but
there
is
no
well
authenticated
account
that
any
of
the
lower
animals
ever
chanced
any
of
their

on

drew

no

has
ever
yet
taught
his
dog
to
play
with
him
at
casino
and
even
the
learned
pig
could
never
learn
what
was

hence
gambling
is
a
proof
of
man
intellectual
superiority
certain
it
is
that
men
from
the
earliest
ages
have
been
addicted
to
some
form
of
gambling
or
settling
matters
by
chance
it
was
by

even
in
legendary
days
there
is
a
pretty
story
that
mercury
fell
in
love
with
rhea
or
the
earth
and
wishing
to
do
her
a
favor
gambled
with
the
moon
and
won
from
her
every
seventieth
part
of
the
time
she
illumined
the
horizon
all
of

parts
he
united
together
making
up
five

and
added
them
to
the

which
had
previously
consisted
of
only
days
and
was
now
there
is
not
an
age
of
the
world
nor
a
people
who
have
not
been
gamblers
the
romans
the
greeks
the
asiatics
all
have
their
games
of
chance
there
was
indeed
a
period
in
the
history
of
the
world
when
gambling
was
the
amusement
and
recreation
of
kings
and
queens
professional
men
and
clergymen
even
john
wesley
the
founder
of
methodism
played
cards
the
rev
caleb
colton
was
one
of
the
luckiest
of
gamesters
he
was
a
graduate
of
cambridge
and
the
author
of
lacon
or
many
things
in
a
few
words
at
one
time
in
paris
he
won
he
left
a
large
fortune
part
of
which
he
employed
in
forming
a
picture
gallery
at
paris
general
scott
the
of
george
canning
made
one
of
the
largest
winnings
ever
known
he
won
at
white
one
million
dollars
owing
to
his
sobriety
and
knowledge
of
the
game
of
whist
who
loved
his
country
more
than
cato
and
yet
he
was
a
great
gambler
guido
the
painter
and
coquillart
a
famous
poet
were
both
inveterate
gamblers
the
great
philosophers
montaigne
and
descartes
at
an
early
age
were
seduced
by
the
allurements
of
gambling
the
generality
of
people
throughout
the
world
are
of
the
opinion
that
gamblers
are
the
worst
people
on
the
face
of
the
earth
they
are
wrong
for
i
tell
you
there
is
ten
times
more
rascality
among
men
outside
of
the
class
they
call
gamblers
than
there
is
inside
it
person
that
the
generality
of
people
class
as
gamblers
are
only
those
who
play
at
games
of
chance
with
cards
what
are
the
members
of
the
board
of
trade
but
gamblers
the
board
of
trade
is
just
as
much
a
gambling
house
as
a
faro
bank
do
not
the
members
put
up
their
and
often
times
other
peoples
money
on
puts
calls
margins
and
futures
do
not
some
poor
people
have
to
wait
a
long
time
in
the
future
before
they
get
back
the
money
some
rascal
has
put
up
and
lost
talk
about
the
morality
of
gamblers
they
are
not
thieves
and
swindlers
and
i
never
heard
of
one
who
ever
served
a
term
in
the
penitentiary
or
was
arrested
for
embezzling
money
george
the
butter
there
goes
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
in
the
country
said
a
gentleman
standing
in
front
of
the
gibson
house
yesterday
the
person
referred
to
was
a
whiskered
individual
of
medium
size
he
is
well
known
to
most
men
about
town
and
his
exploits
on
southern
rivers
might
fill
a
book
it
was
george
devol
i
have
known
him
for
years
the
gentleman
continued
my
acquaintance
with
him
having
been
strictly
in
the
south
do
you
know
that
physically
he
was
for
years
one
of
the
best
men
we
had
down
there
no
never
heard
that
george
was
a
fighter
added
the
reporter
somewhat
surprised
well
he
was
and
as
good
as
they
made
them
too
i
never
saw
him
take
water
in
my
life
and
personally
i
know
that
for
nineteen
years
they
tried
to
find
a
man
to
whip
him
they
could
do
it
he
was
a
terrible
fighter
and
many
a
tough
citizen
have
i
seen
him
do
up
george
was
a
great
he
could
use
his
head
with
terrible
effect
one
night
at
new
orleans
a
stevedore
tackled
him
it
was
a
job
the
stevedore
was
a
much
larger
man
but
george
got
the
best
of
it
during
the
fight
the
friends
stood
over
george
with
drawn
pistols
threatening
to
kill
him
should
he
do
any
butting
he
can
kill
any
man
living
white
or
black
by
butting
him
although
over
fifty
years
of
age
i
do
believe
there
is
a
man
living
who
can
whip
him
new
orleans
sporting
men
will
go
broke
on
that
he
made
considerable
money
in
the
south
did
he
yes
he
has
won
more
money
than
any
sporting
man
in
the
country
he
had
the
privileges
for
years
on
all
boats
on
the
southern
mississippi
when
ben
butler
took
possession
of
new
orleans
he
confiscated
all
of
george
horses
and
sent
him
to
jail
that
little
affair
cost
george
just
he
retaliated
however
for
he
had
not
been
released
two
weeks
until
he
beat
one
of
the
general
paymasters
out
of
it
was
on
the
red
river
i
see
he
has
settled
down
and
quit
sporting
and
i
am
glad
of
it
had
he
never
seen
a
faro
bank
he
would
have
been
an
immensely
wealthy
man
thirty
years
ago
one
night
before
the
war
i
saw
him
lose
at
one
sitting
he
left
the
table
without
enough
money
with
which
to
buy
a
cup
of
coffee
