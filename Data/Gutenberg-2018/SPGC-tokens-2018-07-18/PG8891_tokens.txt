henry
fuller
with
the
procession
introduction
by
mark
harris
i
when
old
marshall
finally
took
to
his
bed
the
household
viewed
this
action
with
more
surprise
than
sympathy
and
with
more
impatience
than
surprise
it
seemed
like
the
breaking
down
of
a
machine
whose
trustworthiness
had
been
hitherto
infallible
his
family
were
almost
forced
to
the
acknowledgement
that
he
was
but
a
mere
human
being
after
all
they
had
enjoyed
a
certain
intimacy
with
him
in
lengths
varying
with
their
respective
ages
but
they
had
never
made
a
full
avowal
that
his
being
rested
on
any
tangible
physical
basis
rather
had
they
fallen
into
the
way
of
considering
him
as
a
disembodied
intelligence
whose
sole
function
was
to
direct
the
transmutation
of
values
and
credits
and
resources
and
opportunities
into
the
creature
comforts
demanded
by
the
state
of
life
unto
which
it
had
please
providence
to
call
them
and
their
dismay
was
now
such
as
might
occur
at
the
mint
if
the
great
stamp
were
suddenly
and
of
its
own
accord
to
cease
its
coinage
of
and
to
sink
into
a
silence
of
supine
idleness
his
wife
and
children
acknowledged
indeed
his
head
and
his
hands
those
it
were
impossible
to
overlook
but
his
head
stopped
with
the
rim
of
his
collar
while
his
hands
those
long
lean
hands
freckled
tufted
goldishly
between
joints
and
knuckles
they
never
followed
beyond
the
plain
gilt
marked
with
a
roman
m
which
secured
the
overlapping
of
his
cuffs
no
poor
old
david
marshall
was
like
one
of
the
early
tuscan
archangels
whose
scattered
members
are
connected
by
draperies
merely
with
no
acknowledged
organism
within
nor
were
his
shining
qualities
fully
recognized
until
the
resolutions
passed
by
the
association
of
wholesale
grocers
reached
the
hands
of
his
bereaved
but
this
is
no
way
to
begin
the
grimy
of
the
drawbridge
swung
to
slowly
the
blackened
the
dull
air
and
roiled
the
turbid
water
as
it
dragged
its
schooner
on
towards
the
of
the
south
branch
and
a
long
line
of
waiting
vehicles
took
up
their
interrupted
course
through
the
smoke
and
the
stench
as
they
filed
across
the
stream
into
the
thick
of
business
beyond
first
a
yellow
then
a
robust
truck
laden
with
rattling
or
piled
high
with
fresh
wooden
pails
and
willow
baskets
then
a
bearing
a
pair
of
dwarfed
and
bearded
poles
who
bumped
in
unison
with
the
jars
of
its
clattering
springs
then
perhaps
a
bespattered
buggy
with
reins
jerked
by
a
pair
of
sinewy
and
impatient
hands
then
more
then
a
butcher
cart
loaded
with
the
carcasses
of
calves
red
black
piebald
or
an
express
wagon
with
a
yellow
cur
yelping
from
its
rear
then
it
may
be
an
insolently
venturesome
landau
with
crested
panel
and
coachman
then
drays
and
omnibuses
and
more
then
presently
somewhere
in
the
line
between
the
tail
end
of
one
truck
and
the
menacing
tongue
of
another
a
family
a
loaded
with
its
family
driven
by
a
man
of
all
work
drawn
by
a
slight
and
amiable
old
mare
and
encumbered
with
luggage
which
shows
the
labels
of
half
the
hotels
of
europe
it
is
a
very
capable
and
comprehensive
vehicle
as
conveyances
of
that
kind
go
it
is
not
new
it
is
not
precisely
in
the
mode
but
it
shows
material
and
workmanship
of
the
best
grade
and
it
is
washed
oiled
polished
with
scrupulous
care
it
advances
with
some
deliberation
and
one
might
fancy
hearing
in
the
rattle
of
its
tires
or
in
the
suppressed
flapping
of
its
rear
curtain
a
word
of
plaintive
protest
i
am
not
of
the
great
world
it
seems
to
say
i
make
no
pretence
to
fashion
we
are
steady
and
solid
but
we
are
not
precisely
in
society
and
we
are
far
very
far
indeed
from
any
attempt
to
cut
a
great
figure
however
do
not
misunderstand
our
position
it
is
not
that
we
are
under
nor
that
we
are
exactly
aside
perhaps
we
have
been
left
just
a
little
behind
yes
that
might
express
it
just
a
little
behind
how
are
they
to
catch
up
again
how
rejoin
the
great
caravan
whose
fast
and
furious
pace
never
ceases
never
slackens
not
assuredly
by
the
help
of
the
little
sorrel
mare
whose
white
mane
swings
so
mildly
and
whose
pale
eyelashes
droop
so
diffidently
when
some
official
hand
at
a
crowded
crossing
brings
her
to
a
temporary
not
by
the
help
of
the
coachman
who
wears
a
and
a
derby
hat
and
whose
frank
face
turns
about
occasionally
for
a
friendly
participation
in
the
talk
that
is
going
on
behind
can
it
be
then
that
any
hopes
for
an
accelerated
movement
are
packed
away
in
the
bulging
portmanteau
which
rests
squeezed
in
between
the
coachman
legs
two
stout
straps
keep
it
from
bursting
and
the
crinkled
brown
leather
of
its
sides
is
completely
pasted
over
with
the
mementoes
used
by
the
hosts
of
the
old
world
to
speed
the
parting
guest
london
and
paris
shine
in
the
lustre
of
the
last
fortnight
tangier
is
distinctly
visible
may
be
readily
inferred
despite
the
overlapping
labels
of
wien
and
b√¢le
while
away
off
to
one
corner
a
crumpled
and
lingering
shred
points
back
though
uncertainly
to
the
parthenon
and
the
acropolis
and
in
the
midst
of
this
flowery
field
is
planted
a
large
m
after
the
best
style
of
the
white
star
line
who
has
come
home
bearing
all
these
sheaves
is
it
to
begin
with
the
young
girl
who
shares
the
front
seat
with
the
driver
and
who
faces
with
an
innocent
unconcern
all
the
clamor
and
evil
of
a
great
city
there
is
a
on
her
red
lips
and
her
black
eyes
sparkle
with
a
girlish
gayety
for
she
does
not
know
how
bad
the
world
is
at
the
same
time
her
chin
advances
confidently
and
her
dark
eyebrows
contract
with
a
certain
soft
imperiousness
for
she
does
not
know
how
hard
the
world
is
nor
how
unyielding
sometimes
she
withdraws
her
glance
from
the
jostling
throng
to
study
the
untidy
and
overlapping
labels
on
the
big
portmanteau
she
betrays
a
certain
curiosity
but
she
shows
at
the
same
time
a
full
determination
not
to
seem
no
the
returned
traveller
is
not
rosy
marshall
all
that
knows
of
life
she
has
learned
from
the
broadcast
cheapness
of
english
and
from
a
short
year
schooling
in
new
york
is
it
then
the
older
girl
who
fills
half
of
the
rear
seat
and
who
as
the
cruel
phrase
goes
will
never
see
thirty
again
she
seems
to
be
tall
and
lean
and
one
divines
somehow
that
her
back
is
narrow
and
of
a
flatness
her
forehead
is
high
and
full
and
its
bulging
outlines
are
but
slightly
softened
by
a
thin
and
dishevelled
bang
her
eyes
are
of
a
light
and
faded
blue
and
have
the
peculiar
stare
which
results
from
eyeballs
when
completely
bordered
by
white
her
long
fingers
show
knotted
joints
and
nails
that
seem
hopelessly
plebeian
sometimes
she
draws
on
lace
mitts
and
then
her
hands
appear
to
be
embroiling
each
other
in
a
mutual
tragedy
no
poor
jane
is
thoroughly
incorruptibly
indigenous
she
is
the
best
and
dearest
girl
in
half
the
world
as
you
shall
see
but
all
her
experiences
have
lain
between
sandusky
and
omaha
perhaps
then
the
returned
traveller
is
the
elderly
woman
seated
by
her
side
perhaps
and
perhaps
not
for
she
seems
a
bit
too
dry
and
sapless
and
as
little
susceptible
in
fact
to
the
gentle
dews
of
travel
as
an
umbrella
in
a
waterproof
case
moreover
it
is
doubtful
if
her
bonnet
would
pass
current
beyond
the
national
confines
one
surmises
that
she
became
years
ago
the
victim
of
arrested
development
that
she
is
a
kind
of
antiquated
villager
a
geologic
survival
from
an
earlier
age
that
she
is
a
cumbered
and
encompassed
by
minute
cares
largely
of
her
own
making
it
is
an
easy
guess
that
for
eliza
marshall
london
is
in
another
world
that
tangier
is
but
a
remote
and
impracticable
abstraction
and
that
all
her
strength
and
fortitude
might
be
necessary
merely
to
make
the
trip
to
peoria
there
is
but
one
other
occupant
of
the
carriage
remaining
the
only
one
after
all
who
can
or
could
be
the
owner
of
the
baggage
he
is
a
young
man
of
and
he
sits
with
his
back
to
the
horse
on
a
little
seat
which
has
been
let
down
for
the
occasion
between
the
usual
two
his
knees
crowd
one
of
the
girls
and
his
elbows
the
other
he
seems
uncommonly
alert
and
genial
he
focusses
brilliantly
the
entire
attention
of
the
party
his
little
black
mustache
flaunts
with
a
picturesque
upward
flourish
and
it
is
supplemented
by
a
small
tuft
at
the
edge
of
his
underlip
an
embellishment
which
overlays
any
slight
trace
of
lingering
juvenility
with
an
effect
which
is
most
knowing
experienced
caprine
if
you
like
and
which
makes
fair
amends
for
the
blanched
cheeks
wrinkled
brows
and
haggard
eyes
that
the
years
have
yet
to
accomplish
for
him
a
tie
sprinkled
with
white
interlacing
circles
spreads
loosely
and
carelessly
over
the
lapels
of
his
coat
and
while
his
clever
eyes
dart
intelligently
from
one
side
to
the
other
of
the
crowded
thoroughfare
his
admiring
family
make
their
own
shy
observations
upon
his
altered
physiognomy
and
his
novel
apparel
upon
his
shoes
and
his
hat
particularly
they
become
acquainted
thus
with
the
florentine
ideal
of
and
the
latest
thing
evolved
by
paris
in
the
way
of
this
young
man
has
passed
back
through
london
quite
unscathed
deduce
from
his
costume
the
independence
of
his
character
and
the
precise
slant
of
his
propensities
the
carriage
moves
on
with
a
halt
here
a
spurt
there
and
many
a
jar
and
jolt
between
and
truesdale
marshall
throws
over
the
shifting
and
resounding
panorama
an
eye
freshened
by
a
four
years
absence
and
informed
by
the
contemplation
of
many
strange
and
diverse
spectacles
presently
a
hundred
yards
of
unimpeded
travel
ends
in
a
blockade
of
trucks
and
and
a
smart
fusillade
of
invective
during
this
enforced
stoppage
the
young
man
becomes
conscious
of
a
vast
unfinished
structure
that
towers
gauntly
overhead
through
the
darkening
and
thickening
air
and
for
which
a
litter
of
iron
beams
in
the
roadway
itself
seems
to
promise
an
indefinite
continuation
skyward
two
three
four
six
seven
nine
he
says
craning
his
neck
and
casting
up
his
eye
then
turning
with
a
jocular
air
to
the
elder
lady
opposite
i
do
suppose
that
marshall
belden
for
instance
have
got
up
to
nine
stories
yet
marshall
belden
she
repeated
her
enunciation
was
strikingly
ejaculatory
and
she
laid
an
impatient
and
unforgiving
emphasis
upon
the
latter
name
i
do
know
what
will
happen
if
your
father
does
assert
himself
pretty
soon
i
should
think
as
much
observed
the
elder
girl
explosively
or
they
will
never
get
up
even
to
seven
the
idea
of
belden
proposing
to
enlarge
by
taking
that
ground
adjoining
but
of
course
poor
pa
did
put
up
the
building
himself
nor
anything
oh
no
so
does
know
whether
the
walls
will
stand
a
couple
of
extra
stories
or
not
upon
my
word
she
went
on
with
increased
warmth
i
do
feel
quite
sure
whether
pa
was
the
one
to
start
the
business
in
the
first
place
and
to
keep
it
going
along
ever
since
or
whether
he
just
a
new
who
began
there
a
week
ago
august
are
we
stuck
here
to
stay
forever
the
little
sorrel
mare
started
up
again
and
entered
upon
another
stage
of
her
journey
the
first
lights
began
to
appear
in
the
the
newsboys
were
shrieking
the
last
editions
of
the
evening
papers
the
frenzied
comedy
of
belated
shopping
commenced
to
manifest
itself
upon
the
pavements
the
throng
of
jostling
women
was
especially
thick
and
eager
before
a
vast
and
vulgar
front
whose
base
was
heaped
with
cheap
truck
cheaply
ticketed
and
whose
long
row
of
windows
was
obscured
by
a
great
reach
of
cotton
cloth
tacked
to
a
flimsy
wooden
frame
unprecedented
bargains
were
offered
in
gigantic
letters
by
the
new
proprietors
eisendrath
heide
the
rest
of
the
name
flapped
loosely
in
the
wind
alas
poor
wethersby
i
knew
him
well
observed
marshall
absently
he
cast
a
pensive
eye
upon
the
name
of
the
former
proprietor
and
took
off
his
hat
to
weigh
it
in
his
hands
with
a
pretence
of
deep
speculation
well
the
philistines
have
got
hold
of
yet
have
they
he
remarked
genially
he
had
not
spent
six
months
in
vienna
for
nothing
i
suppose
we
are
still
worth
twenty
sous
in
the
franc
eh
i
suppose
replied
his
mother
with
a
grim
brevity
she
rather
groped
for
his
meaning
but
she
was
perfectly
certain
of
her
own
i
guess
pa
all
right
declared
his
sister
as
long
as
he
is
left
alone
and
not
interfered
with
the
evening
lights
doubled
and
trebled
long
rows
of
them
appeared
overhead
at
incalculable
altitudes
the
gongs
of
the
cable
cars
clanged
more
and
more
imperiously
as
the
crowds
surged
in
great
numbers
round
grip
and
trailer
the
night
life
of
the
town
began
to
bestir
itself
and
little
rosy
from
her
conspicuous
place
beamed
with
a
bright
intentness
upon
its
motley
spectacle
careless
of
where
her
smiles
might
fall
for
her
the
immodest
theatrical
poster
drooped
in
the
windows
of
saloons
or
caught
a
transient
hold
upon
the
hoardings
of
uncompleted
buildings
brazen
blare
and
gaudy
placards
disgusting
rather
than
indecent
invited
the
into
cheap
museums
and
all
the
unclassifiable
that
is
spawned
by
a
great
city
leered
from
corners
or
slouched
along
the
edge
of
the
gutters
or
stood
in
dark
doorways
or
sold
impossible
rubbish
in
impossible
dialects
wherever
the
public
indulgence
permitted
a
foothold
to
rosy
mother
all
this
involved
no
impropriety
eliza
chicago
was
the
chicago
of
an
arcadia
which
in
some
dim
and
inexplicable
way
had
remained
for
her
an
arcadia
still
bigger
noisier
richer
yet
different
only
in
degree
and
not
essentially
in
kind
she
herself
had
traversed
these
same
streets
in
the
days
when
they
were
the
streets
of
a
mere
town
fane
accompanying
her
mother
courses
as
a
child
had
seen
the
town
develop
into
a
city
and
now
rosy
followed
in
her
turn
though
the
in
of
the
earlier
time
existed
only
in
the
memory
of
old
settlers
and
in
the
device
of
the
municipal
seal
while
the
great
black
city
stood
out
as
a
threatening
and
evil
actuality
mild
old
mabel
had
drawn
them
all
in
turn
or
together
and
had
philosophized
upon
the
facts
as
little
as
any
of
them
but
rosy
brother
who
had
been
about
and
who
knew
more
than
he
was
ever
likely
to
tell
looked
round
at
her
now
and
then
with
a
vague
discomfort
there
called
their
mother
suddenly
did
you
see
that
a
big
lumpish
figure
on
the
crossing
had
loomed
up
at
the
mare
head
a
rough
hand
had
seized
her
bridle
and
a
raw
voice
with
a
rawer
brogue
had
vented
a
piece
of
impassioned
profanity
on
both
beast
and
driver
well
i
do
thank
that
policeman
for
hitting
mabel
on
the
nose
i
can
tell
him
august
did
you
get
his
number
no
answered
the
coachman
he
turned
round
familiarly
i
got
his
breath
i
should
think
so
said
truesdale
and
such
shoes
as
they
have
and
such
hands
and
such
linen
did
that
fellow
see
what
we
were
he
realize
that
we
pay
for
the
buttons
on
his
coat
might
he
have
tried
to
apprehend
that
we
were
people
of
position
here
long
before
he
had
scraped
his
wretched
together
and
what
was
it
he
had
working
in
his
cheek
i
think
i
know
responded
august
mumbling
like
enough
rejoined
truesdale
with
his
eye
upon
the
coachman
own
jaw
his
mother
sputter
of
indignation
died
rapidly
away
it
was
indeed
her
notion
that
the
guardians
of
the
public
peace
should
show
some
degree
of
sobriety
respect
neatness
and
as
well
as
a
reasonable
familiarity
with
the
accents
of
the
country
but
her
arcadia
was
full
of
painful
discrepancies
and
she
did
not
add
to
her
own
pain
by
too
serious
an
attempt
to
reconcile
them
besides
what

mabel
released
from

jarred
over
another
line
of
car
tracks
whereon
a
long
row
of
monsters
glared
at
one
another
slow
advances
with
a
single
great
red
eye
and
then
she
struck
a
freer
gait
on
the
succeeding
stretch
of
belgian
blocks
presently
she
passed
a
lofty
building
which
rose
in
colonnades
one
above
another
but
whose
walls
were
stained
with
smoke
whose
windows
were
half
full
of
shattered
panes
and
whose
fraudulent
metallic
cornice
curled
over
limply
and
jarred
and
jangled
in
the
evening
breeze
one
more
of
the
vicissitudes
of
mercantile
life
well
i
glad
the
has
got
marshall
yet
said
the
young
man
restored
to
by
the
sight
of
another
misfortune
he
used
unconsciously
the
old
firm
name
but
he
get
us
fast
enough
if
the
insurance
was
taken
off
declared
jane
do
you
know
dicky
she
went
on
how
much
that
item
costs
us
a
year
or
have
you
any
idea
how
much
it
has
amounted
to
in
the
last
twenty
without
our
ever
getting
one
cent
back
well
there
ten
thousand
in
the
hartford
and
eight
in
the
monongahela
and
eleven
in
dear
me
jane
exclaimed
her
brother
in
some
surprise
where
do
you
pick
up
all
this
rosy
turned
her
head
half
round
brower
tells
her
she
said
with
a
disdainful
brevity
her
face
was
indistinct
in
the
twilight
but
if
its
expression
corresponded
with
the
inflection
of
her
voice
her
nostrils
were
inflated
and
her
lips
were
curled
in
disparagement
to
jane
in
her
dark
corner
of
the
carriage
this
was
patent
enough
indeed
it
was
sufficiently
obvious
to
all
that
jane
years
availed
little
to
save
her
from
the
searching
criticism
of
her
younger
sister
and
that
miss
rosamund
marshall
bestowed
but
slight
esteem
or
at
least
but
slight
approval
upon
theodore
brower
supposing
he
tell
me
called
jane
absurdly
allowing
herself
to
be
put
on
the
defensive
it
a
mighty
good
thing
i
take
it
if
anybody
else
in
the
family
but
me
who
knows
or
cares
anything
about
poor
pa
business
i
should
like
to
be
told
who
it
is
that
will
do
jane
sounded
her
mother
voice
in
cold
correction
there
no
need
for
you
to
talk
so
your
father
has
run
his
own
business
now
for
years
with
every
year
better
than
the
year
before
and
i
imagine
he
knows
how
to
look
out
for
himself
thank
goodness
we
are
on
a
respectable
pavement
once
more
mabel
turning
a
sudden
corner
had
given
them
a
quick
transition
from
the
rattle
and
jar
of
granite
to
the
gentle
palpitation
that
is
possible
on
macadam
the
carriage
passed
in
review
a
series
of
towering
and
glittering
hotels
told
off
a
score
or
more
of
residences
of
the
elder
day
and
presently
drew
up
before
the
gate
of
an
antiquated
homestead
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
panoramas
just
the
same
old
place
murmured
truesdale
as
he
writhed
out
of
his
cramped
quarters
and
stood
on
the
in
the
dusk
to
stretch
his
legs
wonderful
how
we
contrive
to
stand
in
the
midst
of
all
this
stir
and
change
ii
it
was
at
vevey
one
morning
late
in
august
that
truesdale
marshall
received
the
letter
which
turned
his
face
homeward
the
summons
which
made
it
seem
obligatory
for
him
to
report
at
headquarters
as
he
phrased
it
without
too
great
a
delay
he
was
pacing
along
the
terrace
which
bounded
the
pension
garden
lakeward
and
his
eye
wandered
back
and
forth
between
the
superscription
of
the
envelope
and
the
distant
of
savoy
as
it
appeared
through
the
tantalizing
line
of
clipped
acacias
which
bordered
the
roadway
that
ran
below
him
marshall
he
read
slowly
with
his
eye
on
the
accumulation
of
and
renewed
addresses
they
keep
it
up
right
along
do
they
i
ca
make
them
feel
that
initials
on
an
envelope
are
not
the
best
form
i
ca
bring
them
to
see
that
on
foreign
letters
is
worse
than
a
superfluity
he
referred
once
more
to
the
mountains
of
savoy
they
seemed
to
offer
no
loophole
of
escape
well
i
got
to
do
it
i
suppose
he
made
some
brief
calculations
and
found
that
he
could
put
himself
in
marching
order
within
a
month
or
so
there
was
the
trunk
stored
at
geneva
there
was
that
roomful
of
furniture
at
freiburg
there
was
that
brace
of
paintings
boxed
up
in
florence
and
there
were
the
frayed
and
loosely
flying
ends
of
many
miscellaneous
friendships
i
should
think
the
end
of
october
might
do
for
them
he
droned
reflectively
they
ca
mean
to
cut
me
off
any
shorter
than
that
he
saw
the
steamer
taking
on
passengers
between
the
two
rotund
that
adorned
the
end
of
the
stubby
little
stone
pier
voices
of
shrieking
gladness
came
across
from
the
on
the
terrace
of
the
three
crowns
his
nearest
neighbor
to
the
right
well
america
is
meeting
me
half
way
he
said
i
do
want
to
seem
reluctant
myself

we
make

about
october
truesdale
marshall
had
been
away
from
home
and
friends
for
about
the
length
of
time
ordinarily
required
by
a
course
through
college
but
it
was
not
at
college
that
most
of
this
period
had
been
passed
he
had
left
yale
at
the
end
of
his
sophomore
year
and
had
taken
passage
not
for
chicago
but
for
liverpool
compromising
thus
his
full
claims
on
nurture
from
an
alma
mater
for
the
more
alluring
prospect
of
culture
and
adventure
on
the
continent
this
supplementary
course
of
and
had
now
continued
for
three
years
he
had
written
back
to
his
family
at
discreet
intervals
his
communications
not
being
altogether
untinctured
it
is
true
by
considerations
of
a
financial
nature
and
his
sister
jane
who
charged
herself
with
the
preservation
of
this
correspondence
would
have
undertaken
to
reconstruct
his
route
and
to
make
a
full
report
of
his
movements
up
to
date
on
ten
minutes
notice
she
kept
his
letters
in
a
large
that
she
had
teased
from
her
father
at
the
store
and
two
or
three
times
a
year
she
overhauled
her
previous
entries
so
to
speak
and
added
whatever
new
ones
were
necessary
to
bring
her
books
down
to
the
present
day
she
pleased
herself
on
the
occasion
of
such
reviews
with
the
thought
that
her
brother
long
absence
was
so
largely
and
so
laboriously
educational
there
for
example
was
his
winter
and
spring
at
heidelberg
which
she
figured
as
given
over
to
kant
and
hegel
this
sojourn
was
attested
by
a
photograph
which
showed
her
brother
in
a
preposterous
little
round
cap
as
well
as
with
a
bar
of
not
markedly
philosophical
it
must
be
confessed
upon
one
cheek
again
there
was
his
six
months
stay
in
paris
during
which
time
he
had
dabbled
in
pigments
at
one
of
the
studios
affected
by
americans
her
vouchers
for
this
period
consisted
of
several
they
were
done
in
a
violent
and
fashion
and
had
been
inspired
apparently
by
scenes
in
the
environs
of
the
capital
they
were
marked
meudon
and
st
cloud
and
suresnes
with
the
dates
both
names
and
dates
were
put
where
they
showed
up
very
prominently
jane
was
rather
overcome
by
these
sketches
on
a
first
view
and
after
she
had
pinned
them
up
on
the
walls
of
her
bedroom
she
had
made
no
scruple
over
an
immediate
individual
appropriation
she
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
you
had
to
step
back
some
little
distance
in
order
to
get
them
then
there
was
his
year
at
milan
during
which
he
was
engaged
in
the
cultivation
of
his
voice
at
the
conservatory
a
whole
year
said
innocent
jane
to
herself
think
of
dick
staying
in
one
place
as
long
as
that
she
made
no
account
of
the
easily
accessible
joys
of
monte
carlo
but
figured
him
instead
as
running
interminable
scales
at
all
hours
of
day
and
night
and
as
participating
now
and
then
in
the
chorus
at
the
scala
for
which
purpose
as
he
wrote
her
he
had
had
a
pair
of
tights
made
to
order
in
another
letter
he
sent
her
a
sketch
of
himself
as
he
appeared
while
studying
the
last
act
of
favorita
he
explained
that
the
large
surrounding
him
were
designed
to
give
the
disillusioned
fernando
opportunity
to
see
whether
his
facial
expression
was
corresponding
to
the
nature
of
the
music
he
was
interpreting
all
this
completely
overpowered
poor
jane
it
enveloped
her
head
in
a
roseate
halo
it
wrapped
him
in
the
sweet
and
voluminous
folds
of
a
incense
it
imparted
a
warm
glow
to
his
coolish
summer
in
the
engadine
and
it
illumined
his
archaeological
prowlings
through
the
peloponnesus
it
opened
up
a
dozen
diverging
vistas
to
the
enthusiastic
girl
herself
and
advanced
her
rapidly
in
long
courses
of
expansion
and
improvement
above
all
it
filled
her
with
a
raging
impatience
for
his
return
between
him
and
me
she
would
say
to
herself
something
be
done
pa
never
do
anything
to
get
us
out
of
this
rut
nor
ma
neither
will
roger
nor
alice
and
rosy
well
too
young
to
count
on
yet
but
richard
truesdale
marshall
the
younger
son
of
the
david
marshall
of
lake
street
recently
returned
from
a
long
course
of
travel
and
study
abroad
she
seemed
to
be
quoting
from
the
printed
column
especially
when
assisted
by
his
sister
the
clever
and
intellectual
miss
jane
marshall
who
oh
bother
this
bang
exclaimed
miss
jane
marshall
pettishly
she
threw
her
comb
down
between
and
cologne
bottle
and
flattened
a
frowning
and
protesting
glance
against
her
mirror
i
guess
i
give
up
trying
to
be
beautiful
and
just
be
quaint
david
marshall
received
his
son
with
less
exaltation
he
had
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
liberal
letter
of
credit
which
had
started
the
young
man
on
his
way
and
this
recollection
had
subsequently
been
touched
up
and
heightened
by
the
payment
of
many
drafts
for
varying
but
considerable
amounts
and
he
was
now
concerning
himself
with
the
practical
question
what
have
i
got
for
my
money
he
felt
his
own
share
in
the
evolution
of
this
brilliant
and
cultured
youth
whose
corona
of
accomplishments
might
well
dazzle
and
even
abash
a
plain
business
person
and
he
awaited
with
interest
a
response
to
the
reasonable
interrogation
to
what
end
shall
all
these
means
be
turned
he
received
his
son
with
a
dry
and
cautious
kindness
determined
not
to
be
too
precipitate
in
ascertaining
the
young
man
ideas
as
to
the
future
a
week
more
or
less
could
make
no
great
difference
now
david
marshall
was
a
tall
spare
man
whose
slow
composure
of
carriage
invested
him
with
a
sort
of
homely
dignity
he
wore
a
reddish
beard
now
largely
touched
with
white
a
mixture
whose
effect
prompted
the
suggestion
that
his
grandfather
might
have
been
a
scotchman
and
the
look
from
his
blue
eyes
though
now
no
longer
at
their
brightest
convinced
you
that
his
sight
was
competent
to
cover
the
field
of
vision
to
which
he
had
elected
to
restrict
himself
he
seemed
completely
serious
to
have
been
so
always
to
have
been
born
half
grown
up
to
have
been
dowered
at
the
start
with
too
keen
a
consciousness
of
the
burdens
and
responsibilities
of
life
coltishness
even
by
a
retrospect
of
fifty
years
it
was
impossible
to
attribute
to
him
you
imagined
him
as
having
been
caught
early
broken
to
harness
at
once
and
kept
between
the
shafts
ever
since
it
was
easy
to
figure
him
as
backing
into
position
with
a
sweet
and
reasonable
docility
a
docility
which
saw
no
other
course
or
career
for
a
properly
minded
young
horse
and
which
looked
upon
the
juvenile
antics
of
others
in
the
herd
as
an
unintelligible
and
rather
reprehensible
procedure
he
knew
what
he
was
for
and
his
way
was
before
him
he
had
acted
on
his
knowledge
and
now
at
sixty
he
seemed
still
to
be
travelling
over
the
same
long
straight
road
blinders
at
his
eyes
a
high
wall
on
either
side
no
particular
goal
in
the
dusty
distance
and
an
air
of
patient
resignation
all
about
him
his
burden
too
had
increased
with
the
years
just
as
his
rut
had
grown
deeper
counting
his
family
and
his
poor
relations
and
his
employ√©s
and
families
and
poor
relations
five
or
six
hundred
people
were
dependent
on
him
many
of
these
of
course
had
seats
so
low
that
they
were
almost
choked
by
the
dust
of
the
roadway
but
others
more
pleasantly
situated
were
able
to
overlook
the
enclosing
walls
and
to
enjoy
the
prospect
beyond
among
these
last
was
his
younger
son
who
sat
in
the
highest
place
of
all
and
thence
surveyed
the
universe
the
marshall
house
had
been
built
at
the
time
of
the
opening
of
the
war
and
as
far
out
as
seemed
advisable
for
a
residence
of
the
better
sort
in
those
days
no
definite
had
been
established
so
that
it
was
quite
a
walk
from
the
front
gate
to
the
foot
of
the
front
steps
neither
at
that
time
was
ground
too
valuable
to
make
a
good
bit
of
yard
impracticable
so
that
the
house
had
plenty
of
space
on
all
sides
it
was
a
low
plain
roomy
building
with
a
sort
of
belvedere
and
a
porch
or
two
the
belvedere
was
lingeringly
reminiscent
of
the
vanishing
classic
and
the
decorative
woodwork
of
the
porches
showed
some
faint
traces
of
the
style
which
filled
up
the
years
between
the
ebb
of
the
greek
and
the
vulgar
of
renaissance
taken
altogether
a
sedate
stable
decorous
old
homestead
fit
for
the
family
within
it
in
the
back
yard
behind
a
latticed
some
shrubs
and
bushes
survived
from
a
garden
once
luxuriant
but
now
almost
vanished
there
had
been
a
too
a
valiant
little
grower
which
put
forth
a
cloud
of
white
blossoms
late
in
every
may
and
filled
a
small
pail
with
fruit
early
in
every
july
it
was
thus
that
jane
was
enabled
to
celebrate
her
birthday
which
fell
about
this
time
of
year
with
a
cherry
pie
and
in
especially
favorable
seasons
enough
cherries
were
left
over
to
make
a
small
tart
for
rosy
but
the
atmosphere
had
years
ago
become
too
urban
for
the
poor
which
had
long
since
disappeared
from
mortal
ken
and
the
last
of
the
too
were
holding
their
own
but
poorly
against
the
smoke
and
cinders
of
metropolitan
life
one
of
earliest
recollections
was
that
of
putting
on
her
flat
and
taking
her
tin
pan
and
accompanying
her
mother
out
to
pick
currants
for
the
annual
her
mother
wore
a
flat
too
and
carried
a
tin
pan
both
of
proportionate
size
the
flats
had
long
since
been
cast
aside
and
the
pans
had
become
less
necessary
with
the
dwindling
of
the
but
the
returned
with
every
recurring
july
a
great
many
quarts
of
alien
currants
and
a
great
many
pounds
of
white
sugar
were
fused
in
that
hot
and
sticky
kitchen
and
then
the
cloths
were
hung
to
dry
upon
the
last
remaining
bushes
jane
would
sometimes
reproach
her
parent
with
such
a
proceeding
which
seemed
to
her
hardly
less
reprehensible
than
the
seething
of
a
kid
in
its
mother
milk
but
eliza
marshall
had
scant
receptivity
for
any
such
poetical
analogies
the
cloths
as
seen
through
the
had
a
somewhat
sensational
aspect
they
spoke
of
battle
and
murder
and
sudden
death
and
sometimes
the
policeman
passing
by
if
he
was
a
new
one
thought
for
a
second
that
he
had
stumbled
on
a
clew
eliza
marshall
took
this
risk
quite
willingly
the
idea
of
buying
her
jelly
never
crossed
her
mind
no
she
made
her
own
year
after
year
and
poured
it
out
into
her
little
glass
tumblers
and
sealed
each
tumbler
with
a
of
notepaper
and
marked
each
sheet
according
to
the
sort
of
jelly
it
protected
sometimes
she
made
grape
or
too
she
doled
out
her
products
very
economically
during
the
winter
and
spring
then
she
would
discover
about
the
first
of
june
that
she
had
a
three
months
supply
still
on
hand
then
during
the
summer
the
family
would
live
on
jelly
and
little
else
but
she
remained
year
after
year
the
same
firm
determined
peremptory
person
in
her
kitchen
she
never
spared
herself
there
and
she
never
spared
anybody
else
she
gave
no
more
quarter
at
the
front
of
the
house
than
at
the
back
to
get
fresh
air
into
her
dim
and
parlor
and
to
keep
sun
and
dust
and
smoke
out
this
was
her
one
besetting
problem
there
were
those
windy
days
at
the
end
of
autumn
after
the
had
been
withdrawn
from
the
boulevard
there
were
the
days
about
three
hundred
and
in
the
year
when
the
smoke
and
cinders
from
the
suburban
trains
made
her
house
as
untidy
as
a
and
there
was
her
husband
unconquerable
propensity
for
smoking
a
pleasure
which
she
compelled
him
to
take
outside
on
the
foot
pavement
here
on
pleasant
evenings
he
would
walk
up
and
down
alone
in
a
slow
meditative
fashion
having
little
to
say
and
nobody
to
say
it
to
until
bedtime
came
this
came
early
from
a
habit
early
formed
the
chicago
of
his
young
married
life
had
given
him
little
reason
for
being
abroad
after
nine
at
night
and
he
appeared
to
find
little
more
reason
now
than
then
it
would
not
indeed
have
been
impossible
to
make
him
see
that
in
the
interval
balls
concerts
spectacles
and
urban
doings
had
come
on
with
increasing
number
and
brilliancy
and
that
there
were
now
more
interests
to
justify
a
man
in
remaining
up
until
ten
or
even
until
eleven
but
you
could
not
have
convinced
him
that
all
these
opportunities
were
his
yet
the
consciousness
of
festivities
sometimes
obtruded
upon
his
indifference
now
and
then
on
summer
evenings
when
the
wind
was
from
the
west
certain
brazen
discords
originating
a
street
or
two
behind
the
house
would
come
to
advise
him
that
the
circassian
girl
was
on
view
or
that
a
convention
of
lady
was
in
session
then
there
would
be
weeks
of
winter
nights
when
the
frozen
macadam
in
front
of
the
house
would
ring
with
a
thousand
prancing
hoofs
and
rumble
for
an
hour
with
a
steady
flow
of
carriages
and
the
walls
of
the
great
temple
of
music
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
north
would
throw
back
all
this
clamor
with
the
added
notes
of
slamming
doors
and
shouted
numbers
and
epic
struggles
between
angry
drivers
and
determined
policemen
sometimes
he
would
extend
his
smoking
stroll
far
enough
to
skirt
the
edge
of
all
this
babel
then
towards
midnight
long
after
all
staid
and
sensible
people
were
abed
the
flood
would
roll
back
faster
yet
under
the
quiet
moon
louder
yet
through
the
frosty
air
but
he
never
met
the
circassian
beauty
and
he
would
have
found
for
example
both
tedious
and
unreasonable
to
him
each
of
these
publics
was
new
and
no
less
new
than
alien
besides
it
would
have
seemed
an
uncanny
thing
to
be
abroad
and
stirring
at
midnight
why
did
he
go
to
bed
at
nine
in
order
that
he
might
be
at
the
store
by
seven
why
must
he
be
at
the
store
by
seven
because
a
very
large
area
to
the
west
and
northwest
of
the
town
looked
to
him
for
supplies
of
teas
coffees
spices
flour
sugar
because
he
had
always
been
accustomed
to
furnish
these
supplies
because
it
was
the
only
thing
he
wanted
to
do
because
it
was
the
only
thing
he
could
do
because
it
was
the
only
thing
he
was
pleased
and
proud
to
do
because
it
was
the
sole
thing
which
enabled
him
to
look
upon
himself
as
a
useful
stable
honored
member
of
society
but
it
need
not
be
supposed
that
the
marshalls
in
their
young
married
days
had
lived
totally
bereft
of
social
diversion
quite
the
contrary
they
had
had
and
now
and
then
and
more
than
once
they
had
thrown
their
house
open
for
a
church
sociable
but
the
day
came
when
the
church
jumped
from
its
old
site
three
blocks
away
to
a
new
site
three
miles
away
and
by
that
time
most
of
their
old
neighbors
and
fellow
had
gone
too
some
southward
some
northward
some
heavenward
then
business
in
the
guise
of
big
hotels
began
marching
down
the
street
upon
them
and
business
in
all
manner
of
guise
ran
up
towering
walls
behind
them
that
shut
off
the
summer
sun
hours
before
it
was
due
to
sink
and
traffic
rang
incessant
gongs
at
their
back
door
and
drew
lengthening
lines
of
across
the
lake
view
from
their
front
one
and
sunday
crowds
strolled
and
sprawled
over
the
wide
green
between
the
roadway
and
the
waterway
and
tramps
and
beggars
and
peddlers
advanced
daily
in
a
steady
and
disconcerting
phalanx
and
bolts
and
bars
and
chains
and
gratings
and
eternal
vigilance
were
all
required
to
keep
mine
from
becoming
thine
until
in
the
year
of
grace
the
marshalls
had
almost
come
to
realize
that
they
were
living
solitary
and
in
a
state
of
siege
but
they
had
never
yet
thought
of
capitulation
nor
of
retreat
they
were
the
old
guard
they
were
not
going
to
surrender
nor
to
die
either
as
the
advance
guard
of
all
old
david
marshall
frequently
occupied
the
most
advanced
bastion
of
all
the
parlor
here
in
the
he
was
accustomed
to
sit
and
think
and
his
family
let
him
sit
and
think
unconscious
that
it
would
sometimes
be
a
kindness
to
break
in
upon
the
habit
he
pondered
on
the
markets
and
on
the
movements
of
trade
he
kept
one
eye
for
the
shabby
wayfarers
who
threw
a
longing
look
upon
his
basement
gratings
and
another
for
the
showers
of
sparks
and
black
plumes
of
smoke
which
came
to
remind
him
of
corporate
encroachments
upon
municipal
rights
and
here
one
evening
he
sat
some
few
days
after
his
son
return
while
a
hubbub
of
female
voices
came
to
him
from
the
next
room
his
from
three
miles
down
the
street
and
his
married
daughter
from
ten
miles
out
in
the
suburbs
had
come
to
show
some
civility
to
the
returned
traveller
and
the
conjunction
of
two
such
stars
was
not
to
be
effected
in
silence
nor
was
silence
to
be
secured
even
by
a
retreat
from
one
room
to
another
well
pa
you
here
sure
enough
a
hand
pulled
aside
the
curtain
and
made
the
a
part
of
the
parlor
again
poking
off
by
yourself
and
thinking
i
know
when
i
told
you
so
many
times
not
to
it
was
jane
it
was
her
office
to
keep
the
family
from
disintegration
none
of
them
realized
it
hardly
she
herself
she
perched
on
the
arm
of
his
big
chair
placed
her
hand
on
his
forehead
and
looked
in
his
face
with
a
quizzical
pretence
of
impatience
these
little
passages
sometimes
occurred
in
the
hardly
anywhere
else
well
what
is
it
this
time
she
asked
her
intention
was
tender
but
her
voice
issued
with
a
kind
of
explosive
grate
the
natural
product
of
vocal
cords
racked
by
the
lake
winds
of
thirty
springs
and
wrecked
by
a
thousand
sudden
and
violent
transitions
from
heat
to
cold
and
back
again
not
belden
i
hope
no
jennie
that
will
come
out
all
right
i
expect
we
had
a
talk
with
the
builder
about
it
today
he
looked
at
her
with
a
kind
of
wan
and
patient
smile
his
own
voice
was
dry
husky
sibilant
sixty
years
of
lake
michigan
she
smiled
back
at
his
jennie
that
was
always
her
name
on
such
occasions
it
is
about
oolong
she
asked
in
burlesque
anxiety
no
well
then
is
it
the
sisters
not
the
sisters
they
were
in
last
week
guess
again
then
said
jane
perseveringly
is
it
is
it
the
benevolent
policemen
no
not
the
policemen
they
wo
be
around
for
a
month
yet
her
hand
dropped
to
his
shoulder
and
her
eyes
searched
his
to
another
they
might
have
seemed
staring
to
him
they
were
only
intent
poor
pa
he
like
a
standing
at
the
end
of
the
alley
is
he
they
all
take
a
turn
at
him
do
they
i
afraid
that
about
it
jennie
he
smiled
rather
wanly
again
and
smoothed
her
hand
with
his
own
well
what
else
is
there
pondered
jane
is
it
the
bishop
raising
the
mortgage
on
their
chapel
no
i
guess
the
have
about
paid
things
off
by
this
time
how
lonesome
they
must
leave
you
h
is
it
the
michigan
avenue
property
owners
assessing
you
again
to
fight
the
cars
her
father
shook
his
head
and
almost
laughed
is
it
the
wives
of
the
presidents
is
it
mothers
of
great
men
what
a
girl
he
said
and
laughed
aloud
it
seemed
as
if
he
wanted
to
laugh
she
eyed
him
narrowly
there
only
one
thing
more
i
can
think
of
she
declared
screwing
up
her
mouth
and
her
eyes
but
i
ask
you
that
it
too
silly
if
i
imagined
for
a
moment
that
you
could
be
thinking
about
old
mother
van
horn
she
paused
her
father
cast
down
his
eyes
half
guiltily
do
say
you
are
that
would
be
too
absurd
you
with
all
the
important
things
you
have
to
carry
in
your
head
to
waste
a
minute
on
that
frowzy
old
hag
it
is
worth
it
it
nonsense
i
do
know
whether
it
is
or
not
responded
her
father
slowly
he
passed
a
careful
hand
through
the
fringe
of
the
chair
that
what
like
to
find
out
oh
fiddlesticks
rejoined
jane
you
sit
poking
here
in
the
dark
and
thinking
of
any
such
thing
as
that
not
another
minute
come
in
and
hear
dick
tell
how
those
students
in
paris
tied
him
to
the
wall
and
daubed
him
all
red
and
green
and
what
he
did
to
get
even
worth
while
and
you
have
seen
aunt
lyddy
yet
have
you
so
is
it
then
come
along
do
iii
i
was
a
student
at
cadiz
i
played
on
the
spanish
guitar
i
used
to
make
love
to
the
ladies
this
brief
snatch
of
song
ended
with
the
obvious
and
indeed
inevitable
rhyme
for
cadiz
and
the
singer
completed
the
stanza
by
throwing
an
arch
and
rather
insinuating
glance
at
the
young
man
who
was
lounging
negligently
on
the
chair
beside
her
own
she
herself
leaned
back
rather
negligently
too
with
her
feet
crossed
her
elbows
were
crooked
at
varying
angles
her
fingers
pressed
imaginary
frets
or
plucked
at
imaginary
strings
and
the
spectator
was
supposed
to
be
viewing
an
andalusian
grace
and
passion
abandoned
to
the
soft
yet
compelling
power
of
music
it
was
thus
that
truesdale
marshall
was
welcomed
home
by
his
aunt
lydia
his
aunt
lydia
lydia
rhodes
was
a
plump
and
vivacious
little
brunette
of
forty
with
a
gloss
on
her
black
hair
and
a
sparkle
in
her
black
eyes
she
still
retained
a
good
deal
of
the
superabundant
vitality
of
youth
in
her
own
house
when
the
curtains
were
down
and
the
company
not
too
miscellaneous
she
was
sometimes
equal
to
a
or
a
she
was
impelled
by
social
aspirations
of
the
highest
nature
and
was
always
lamenting
therefore
that
she
possessed
so
little
dignity
she
was
a
impulsive
creature
who
believed
in
living
while
on
earth
and
she
was
willing
enough
to
believe
that
others
would
live
too
so
far
as
opportunity
offered
it
seemed
to
truesdale
just
now
as
if
she
might
be
engaged
in
a
mental
review
of
his
probable
experiences
abroad
there
certainly
was
an
opportunity
offered
but
now
that
you
are
back
again
we
expect
you
to
settle
down
and
be
good
a
useful
member
of
society
you
know
she
threw
a
coquettish
smile
on
the
young
man
and
banished
the
imaginary
guitar
oh
really
began
truesdale
with
a
flush
and
a
frown
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
his
mother
and
sisters
were
in
animated
converse
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
yes
his
aunt
proceeded
you
are
old
enough
to
think
about
marrying
you
do
know
how
pleasant
it
would
be
to
have
a
nice
little
home
of
your
own
and
your
own
little
wifey
to
meet
you
every
evening
with
a
kiss
dear
dear
thought
truesdale
to
himself
and
now
she
singing
that
song
to
he
remembered
these
familiar
strains
they
had
been
directed
many
a
time
and
oft
to
the
ear
of
his
brother
roger
year
by
year
their
plaintive
poignancy
had
grown
more
acute
along
with
strengthening
determination
to
remain
a
bachelor
truesdale
found
himself
wondering
whether
his
aunt
intense
allegiance
to
the
idea
of
married
life
was
the
sincere
expression
of
a
nature
overflowingly
affectionate
or
a
species
of
sensitive
dissimulation
cloaking
a
disappointment
which
by
this
time
might
well
have
come
to
be
numbered
among
the
bygones
for
it
was
now
six
years
since
alfred
rhodes
the
gay
the
genial
had
died
he
had
cost
his
wife
many
anxious
moments
and
a
few
sleepless
nights
he
had
left
her
a
moderate
fortune
an
ample
freedom
and
a
boy
of
eight
she
had
increased
her
freedom
by
sending
the
boy
off
to
an
eastern
school
he
visited
eastern
relatives
during
vacation
time
and
was
doomed
to
a
longer
course
of
knickerbockers
than
it
would
have
pleased
him
to
forecast
his
mother
heart
still
palpitated
youthfully
she
showed
herself
in
no
haste
to
take
her
stand
in
the
ranks
of
the
elder
generation
yes
rhodes
proceeded
you
must
get
into
business
and
then
we
shall
have
to
find
some
nice
girl
for
you
the
same
thoughtful
aunt
lydia
he
observed
ironically
he
gave
his
mustache
an
upward
screw
then
dropped
his
eyes
to
his
knees
and
his
fingers
to
the
rungs
of
his
chair
his
design
seemed
to
be
to
figure
a
slave
shrinking
on
the
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
got
one
for
me
already
he
ignored
the
business
side
of
her
proposal
well
you
need
put
it
way
she
rejoined
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
am
not
a
nor
anything
like
it
and
it
please
me
at
all
to
have
anybody
say
so
of
me
or
to
think
of
me
in
that
way
she
was
quite
sincere
in
all
this
truesdale
however
held
the
opposite
view
and
considering
all
the
circumstances
liked
his
aunt
none
the
less
she
a
a
very
keen
and
persistent
one
but
he
felt
that
her
excesses
in
this
direction
were
to
be
viewed
simply
as
an
acknowledgement
to
fortune
for
having
guided
her
own
courses
to
such
advantage
she
had
come
out
from
trenton
some
eighteen
years
before
with
a
pretty
face
a
light
wardrobe
a
limited
purse
and
an
invitation
extended
by
a
benevolent
aunt
to
remain
as
long
as
she
liked
she
had
never
gone
back
she
met
alfred
rhodes
eliza
marshall
younger
brother
and
from
the
slight
foothold
offered
by
her
kindly
relative
she
had
advanced
to
an
ample
fortune
and
a
complete
freedom
she
was
grateful
for
all
this
and
gratitude
took
the
form
of
her
extending
in
turn
unlimited
invitations
to
other
girls
with
pretty
faces
light
purses
and
limited
wardrobes
she
almost
always
had
some
comely
niece
or
younger
cousin
in
the
house
she
drove
with
them
she
shopped
with
them
she
gave
teas
and
receptions
for
them
she
summoned
young
men
in
numbers
she
had
her
she
could
always
produce
sherry
and
cigars
when
really
put
to
it
she
almost
transformed
her
home
into
a
for
said
she
i
can
never
forget
how
kind
aunt
marcia
was
to
such
beneficence
as
this
had
not
of
course
excluded
her
daughters
it
was
really
to
her
aunt
lydia
that
rosamund
marshall
was
indebted
for
her
year
at
the
new
york
school
her
mother
had
unquestioningly
accepted
rhodes
declaration
that
the
institution
was
eminently
fashionable
and
desirable
and
her
father
had
committed
her
with
the
greatest
confidence
and
to
the
conductor
of
the
lake
shore
express
and
it
was
to
her
aunt
that
the
girl
was
now
looking
after
an
obscure
and
wistful
fashion
for
an
introduction
into
society
in
which
according
to
the
belief
of
the
family
rhodes
occupied
a
secure
and
brilliant
position
rosamund
had
been
revolving
matters
in
her
pretty
and
little
head
and
in
her
proud
and
little
heart
she
had
decided
upon
a
formal
d√©but
her
mother
was
completely
nonplussed
she
would
as
soon
have
wrestled
with
the
differential
calculus
why
dear
me
she
stammered
alice
she
never
came
out
and
i
do
see
but
what
she
got
along
all
right
good
home
nice
husband
and
everything
she
wants
and
jane
now
oh
said
rosy
in
disdain
then
she
sulked
and
reproached
her
mother
with
the
flat
and
unprofitable
summer
that
had
followed
her
return
from
school
and
asked
pointedly
if
the
coming
winter
was
to
be
like
it
ha
exclaimed
the
poor
woman
to
herself
lyddy
is
to
blame
for
this
i
wish
she
had
never
mentioned
new
york
but
the
year
at
school
was
only
a
remoter
cause
the
more
immediate
one
was
a
pink
tea
which
rosamund
had
attended
casually
as
it
were
and
quite
informally
a
month
back
this
was
the
tigress
first
taste
of
blood
a
pale
diluted
fluid
it
is
true
but
it
worked
all
the
effect
of
a
fuller
and
richer
draught
it
developed
in
rosamund
a
sixth
sense
one
which
was
to
lead
her
to
lengths
that
none
of
her
kin
could
have
anticipated
and
to
the
rest
of
the
family
clucking
and
scratching
in
their
own
retired
and
restricted
there
came
the
day
when
they
discovered
that
their
little
flock
contained
at
least
one
bird
of
a
different
feather
a
bird
that
could
paddle
about
the
social
pond
with
the
liveliest
and
could
quack
if
need
be
with
the
loudest
jane
who
had
even
yet
no
adequate
sense
of
the
strength
and
pungency
of
her
younger
sister
spirit
but
who
would
not
in
any
event
have
hesitated
to
rush
on
an
individual
martyrdom
that
might
secure
some
consideration
for
the
collective
family
threw
herself
into
the
discussion
at
once
no
do
let
have
any
party
or
dance
or
reception
or
anything
at
all
not
even
a
tea
do
let
try
to
be
anybody
or
know
anybody
or
give
anything
or
be
considered
anything
let
go
right
on
rusting
and
vegetating
let
just
dry
up
and
shake
apart
and
blow
away
with
nobody
the
wiser
for
our
having
been
here
or
the
sorrier
for
our
having
gone
her
mother
heard
this
outburst
with
some
surprise
and
not
a
little
resentment
well
jane
you
quite
surpassing
yourself
what
do
you
mean
by
all
this
jane
exploded
again
i
mean
that
i
simply
tired
of
being
a
nothing
and
a
nobody
in
a
family
of
nothings
and
nobodies
that
what
it
comes
to
i
tired
of
being
a
bump
on
a
log
i
tired
of
sitting
on
the
fence
and
seeing
the
procession
go
by
why
ca
go
by
why
ca
know
people
why
ca
make
ourselves
felt
other
folks
do
rhodes
passed
over
in
silence
this
imputation
of
nullity
she
was
not
so
closely
related
after
all
that
she
need
allow
herself
to
be
disturbed
by
it
but
sister
alice
took
up
the
cudgel
with
all
the
ardor
of
an
immediate
connection
and
all
the
sensitiveness
of
a
suburban
resident
she
even
forgot
the
real
essential
object
of
her
visit
to
intimate
to
her
father
that
if
he
would
give
her
a
carriage
her
husband
could
pay
for
the
keep
of
a
horse
she
was
a
contentious
blonde
with
a
thin
aquiline
nose
and
a
pair
of
flashing
eyes
several
wisps
of
hair
blew
about
her
temples
thank
you
jane
she
said
hotly
i
do
know
that
i
feel
myself
a
nobody
and
i
do
feel
that
i
exactly
a
social
outcast
even
if
i
live
beyond
the
city
limits
she
turned
back
a
floating
lock
with
a
hasty
wave
it
might
be
to
your
advantage
if
you
moved
somewhere
or
other
yourselves
i
do
see
how
you
can
expect
to
see
anybody
or
know
anybody
as
long
as
you
are
buried
in
such
a
sepulchre
as
this
alice
was
the
radical
the
innovator
of
the
family
she
often
brought
her
conservative
mother
to
the
verge
of
horror
hers
was
the
hardy
daring
and
unconventional
strain
of
the
pioneer
she
liked
the
edge
if
the
edge
was
a
little
ragged
so
much
the
better
ho
cried
jane
sarcastically
to
see
anybody
or
to
know
anybody
we
ought
to
be
out
at
riverdale
park
perhaps
riverdale
park
she
repeated
with
scornful
emphasis
there
is
any
river
there
is
any
dale
there
is
any
park
nothing
but
a
lot
of
wooden
houses
scattered
over
a
flat
prairie
and
a
few
trees
no
bigger
than
a
broomstick
and
no
more
leaves
on
them
either
in
the
morning
the
men
all
rush
for
the
train
and
the
rest
of
the
day
the
trundle
the
babies
along
the
plank
walks
while
amuses
itself
society
consists
of
smith
brown
jones
and
alice
robinson
on
wednesday
smith
gives
a
lunch
to
brown
jones
and
robinson
on
thursday
brown
gives
a
tea
to
smith
jones
and
robinson
on
friday
mrs
rob
no
jones
i
losing
the
place
gives
a
to
smith
brown
and
robinson
in
the
daytime
too
mind
you
and
on
saturday
robinson
designs
giving
a
breakfast
to
smith
brown
and
jones
but
finds
that
the
cook
is
packing
up
her
things
to
leave
quiet
in
the
suburb
for
a
week
then
smith
sister
comes
out
from
town
to
spend
a
fortnight
well
everybody
is
anxious
to
see
smith
sister
a
new
face
you
know
so
after
smith
has
started
the
second
round
with
another
lunch
brown
follows
with
a
tea
as
before
for
smith
jones
robinson
smith
sister
then
jones
but
you
all
played
the
game
for
breakfast
i
had
this
and
that
and
the
other
that
is
society
in
riverdale
park
it
would
be
too
rich
for
alice
flushed
with
vexation
truesdale
who
had
not
come
home
to
treat
local
society
with
too
great
a
degree
of
seriousness
and
who
indeed
was
like
enough
to
take
his
pleasures
beyond
any
bounds
that
society
might
set
looked
on
and
listened
with
a
kind
of
indulgent
curiosity
like
an
explorer
listening
to
the
excited
of
some
flock
of
natives
in
some
remote
african
jungle
yes
retorted
alice
according
to
your
own
confession
more
happens
with
us
in
a
week
than
happens
with
you
in
a
year
and
you
might
as
well
acknowledge
at
the
same
time
that
there
are
a
few
houses
in
the
park
where
the
carpets
are
a
little
less
than
fifteen
years
old
and
where
they
do
have
hideous
old
loaded
down
with
all
the
stuff
accumulated
since
the
year
one
she
lifted
the
corner
of
a
rug
with
her
toe
so
as
to
disclose
the
threadbare
breadth
that
it
concealed
and
she
threw
an
ironical
eye
upon
a
sort
of
massive
and
convoluted
buffet
which
displayed
a
number
of
antique
dresden
figurines
and
a
pair
of
old
candelabra
compounded
of
tarnished
gilt
and
broken
prisms
and
in
the
park
she
added
we
always
have
new
at
the
beginning
of
every
century
it
a
local
ordinance
alice
called
her
mother
tartly
take
your
foot
away
from
that
rug
and
do
annoy
me
about
that
worn
breadth
you
know
very
well
i
tried
everywhere
to
match
it
and
do
imagine
either
that
i
going
to
bundle
my
wedding
presents
out
of
sight
for
you
or
anybody
else
match
it
cried
alice
unabashed
match
it
they
used
the
last
to
carpet
the
ark
she
trod
down
the
corner
of
the
rug
with
a
firm
step
then
with
her
scornful
nostrils
and
sharply
critical
eyes
she
seemed
to
be
lifting
it
again
well
then
said
her
mother
and
now
leave
it
alone
the
old
lady
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
replacing
her
patterns
by
anything
more
current
nor
was
her
husband
apparently
of
a
different
mind
as
concerned
the
wallpaper
he
had
followed
jane
in
from
the
other
room
and
he
now
sat
there
sending
a
careful
eye
slowly
along
the
border
and
finding
it
impossible
to
believe
that
any
one
could
seriously
judge
it
to
be
grotesquely
out
of
date
the
carpet
all
right
as
far
as
i
can
see
declared
jane
what
if
it
fifteen
years
old
have
you
got
one
at
riverdale
that
is
even
fifteen
months
old
you
know
you
have
if
you
had
you
start
a
museum
of
antiques
with
it
and
as
for
our
budging
from
this
dear
old
place
do
you
look
for
it
we
attached
to
it
even
if
you
not
besides
to
move
would
be
to
throw
away
the
one
advantage
that
we
really
have
why
think
of
it
she
continued
with
a
gesticulating
and
eloquence
we
have
lived
right
here
in
this
one
house
over
thirty
years
how
many
families
in
this
town
have
lived
in
one
house
thirty
years
or
twenty
or
even
ten
we
always
had
the
same
on
the
same
door
we
always
had
the
same
number
in
the
directory
we
started
in
a
good
neighborhood
and
we
always
stayed
here
the
only
one
in
all
the
town
that
has
anything
like
an
flavor
and
an
atmosphere
of
its
own
the
only
one
where
nice
people
have
always
lived
and
do
live
yet
is
that
better
than
a
course
of
flats
up
one
street
and
down
another
is
that
better
than
a
grand
chain
through
a
lot
of
cottages
in
the
suburbs
i
should
say
so
what
are
they
doing
in
the
east
now
they
going
back
to
their
old
neighborhoods
and
the
people
who
have
left
them
at
all
are
the
ones
who
are
right
on
the
top
of
the
pile
we
might
have
some
new
furniture
or
something
of
the
sort
perhaps
but
that
different
from
asking
the
to
come
and
cart
us
out
on
to
the
prairie
david
marshall
followed
his
daughter
harangue
with
an
indulgent
interest
and
a
sympathy
by
no
means
scant
he
had
no
profound
apprehension
of
social
values
and
no
conception
of
a
social
career
but
he
appreciated
her
loyalty
to
her
lifelong
home
and
to
all
its
belongings
and
surroundings
he
had
reason
for
supposing
that
this
loyalty
would
extend
to
himself
but
jane
was
wound
up
to
go
and
had
no
idea
of
allowing
anything
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
disposal
of
the
question
in
all
its
bearings
i
suppose
she
went
on
inexorably
that
we
imagine
ourselves
to
be
citizens
well
we
make
a
mistake
if
we
do
we
may
have
been
ten
years
ago
but
not
now
we
just
been
falling
falling
falling
behind
that
the
amount
of
it
now
honest
pa
dear
do
the
papers
ever
come
to
you
nowadays
to
know
what
you
think
about
political
prospects
or
to
ask
your
opinion
on
the
last
new
route
proposed
or
do
they
send
men
around
for
trade
statistics
who
jubilate
in
the
issue
of
one
because
we
sold
five
thousand
more
barrels
of
flour
this
year
than
last
now
do
they
marshall
could
not
escape
the
justness
of
this
pointed
presentation
of
new
conditions
we
have
enough
to
bother
us
he
said
with
a
slow
reluctance
without
reporters
coming
round
there
it
is
continued
jane
yes
and
who
cares
nowadays
about
the
volume
of
the
lumber
trade
or
the
mortality
at
the
why
just
those
people
themselves
the
fact
is
the
town
has
moved
to
a
higher
plane
and
we
got
to
move
with
it
or
else
get
left
why
dear
me
if
it
was
for
an
intellectual
daughter
who
had
the
gift
of
language
and
who
wrote
papers
and
read
them
at
the
club
this
family
would
have
scarcely
a
connection
with
society
good
for
you
jane
called
her
brother
give
me
some
of
them
to
read
they
pretty
good
said
their
father
unruffledly
judicial
jane
was
in
the
habit
of
reading
him
passages
that
she
considered
particularly
effective
in
listening
to
her
perorations
he
sometimes
felt
himself
as
assisting
at
the
liquidation
of
the
universe
now
here
we
are
proceeded
jane
with
unabated
exegetical
energy
an
old
family
with
position
and
plenty
of
means
and
everything
to
make
an
impression
why
ca
we
do
it
why
ca
we
manage
to
assert
ourselves
i
not
speaking
for
myself
of
course
i
a
back
number
this
half
hysterically
between
a
gulp
and
a
giggle
i
beyond
recall
and
nobody
knows
that
better
than
i
myself
no
i
speaking
for
all
of
us
besides
here
rosy
just
coming
up
and
thank
you
jane
remarked
rosamund
with
some
acerbity
you
mind
me
i
can
look
after
myself
and
it
seems
to
me
went
on
jane
ardently
that
people
who
have
succeeded
might
just
as
well
give
some
outer
token
of
it
i
declare
when
i
called
on
bates
and
went
over
the
place
and
compared
their
house
and
their
way
of
living
with
ours
her
aunt
looked
up
suddenly
bates
what
bates
granger
bates
yes
when
i
saw
what
magnificent
style
she
lived
in
and
how
she
had
about
everything
that
so
you
know
bates
too
her
aunt
again
interrupted
pleasant
woman
is
she
have
i
ever
told
you
how
she
and
i
used
to
play
backgammon
together
at
st
augustine
you
muttered
jane
i
should
think
you
had
a
dozen
times
over
and
what
were
you
doing
at
house
may
i
ask
her
aunt
queried
further
the
geniality
of
this
interrogation
hardly
concealed
its
crudity
jane
felt
herself
accused
of
an
incongruous
and
inexplicable
intrusion
into
a
region
of
unaccustomed
splendor
and
distinction
oh
she
was
collecting
money
for
her
lunchroom
volunteered
rosy
with
a
cruel
bluntness
jane
threw
an
air
of
outraged
dignity
upon
her
younger
sister
so
i
was
and
i
spent
a
very
pleasant
hour
with
her
she
said
with
some
stateliness
and
i
am
going
there
next
wednesday
to
lunch
she
added
her
aunt
looked
at
her
with
increasing
consideration
she
herself
had
never
been
honored
with
an
invitation
to
the
house
of
granger
bates
though
rather
than
fail
to
respond
to
such
an
invitation
she
would
have
crawled
there
a
trifle
of
some
fourteen
squares
on
her
hands
and
knees
have
you
known
her
long
since
ten
this
morning
contributed
rosy
always
corrected
jane
with
a
whimsical
brevity
and
how
do
you
find
her
persisted
rhodes
with
a
curious
intentness
dear
me
she
laughed
how
she
did
hate
to
be
beaten
how
vexed
she
always
was
when
i
began
throwing
off
first
how
she
would
bang
her
how
she
would
she
perfectly
grand
declared
jane
with
the
loud
enthusiasm
of
a
new
and
fervent
loyalty
she
the
finest
woman
i
ever
met
she
the
best
woman
in
the
world
the
poor
girl
attested
her
earnestness
by
a
tremble
in
her
voice
and
a
tear
in
each
eye
and
she
spoke
so
nicely
of
you
poppy
jane
went
on
turning
to
her
father
did
she
said
her
father
in
return
and
a
quiet
smile
of
reminiscence
played
round
his
lips
for
full
five
minutes
and
she
inquired
about
all
of
us
jane
proceeded
she
wants
to
renew
the
acquaintance
i
think
and
she
asked
about
rosy
too
whether
she
was
pretty
and
bright
and
i
said
she
was
i
expect
she
inclined
to
take
an
interest
in
you
said
jane
in
conclusion
turning
towards
her
sister
and
dropping
these
few
coals
of
fire
upon
her
head
rosamund
caught
the
proper
tone
from
her
aunt
and
bowed
in
unaccustomed
meekness
to
this
shower
alice
however
as
a
confirmed
and
condemned
suburbanite
had
no
idea
of
exhibiting
any
great
interest
in
one
of
the
acknowledged
leaders
of
urban
society
an
interest
which
from
the
very
nature
of
things
could
have
been
but
futile
and
unproductive
she
accordingly
toyed
carelessly
and
absently
with
the
evening
paper
as
it
lay
on
the
h
she
observed
presently
those
at
the
pacific
are
still
going
on
are
they
the
nice
things
too
as
i
remember
them
that
the
way
i
learned
to
like
venison
here
are
some
of
the
people
to
be
there
your
bates
among
them
she
looked
across
to
her
father
why
did
go
give
me
that
paper
alice
her
mother
called
with
a
sharp
and
sudden
cry
she
ran
her
eye
down
its
column
and
then
turned
to
her
husband
why
david
how
did
you
happen
to
forget
you
know
i
would
have
missed
this
for
anything
marshall
checked
his
lingering
smile
he
looked
at
his
wife
with
an
embarrassed
pain
and
then
dropped
his
eyes
to
the
carpet
there
must
have
been
some
misunderstanding
he
stammered
the
invitation
was
delayed
or
it
miscarried
perhaps
it
went
to
the
store
and
got
mixed
up
with
the
mail
there
he
ventured
any
improbability
would
do
to
soften
the
shock
delayed
miscarried
cried
jane
in
an
acute
access
of
anger
and
indignation
do
believe
it
we
dropped
that
all
well
what
else
can
we
expect
how
are
we
going
to
hold
our
own
against
all
these
thousands
and
thousands
of
newcomers
if
we
do
do
anything
that
what
i
been
telling
you
all
along
we
got
to
wake
up
and
make
an
effort
give
me
that
paper
she
snatched
it
from
her
mother
yes
they
all
be
there
the
hubbards
the
gages
and
the
whole
crowd
of
parmelees
and
kittie
corwith
and
her
father
and
all
the
rest
and
and
the
beldens
the
beldens
there
she
turned
fiercely
on
her
mother
what
do
you
think
of
that
eliza
marshall
was
cut
to
the
quick
for
twenty
years
and
more
she
had
attended
this
annual
dinner
she
had
attached
herself
there
to
former
friends
and
neighbors
who
listened
indulgently
to
her
narrow
little
dribble
of
reminiscent
gossip
the
gossip
and
reminiscences
of
the
smaller
town
and
the
earlier
day
this
dinner
was
her
sole
remaining
connection
little
as
she
had
realized
it
with
the
great
and
complex
city
of
the
present
day
just
as
it
was
the
sole
reason
for
her
silk
and
for
her
husband
and
the
cutting
of
this
last
cable
set
her
completely
adrift
on
the
wide
and
forlorn
sea
of
utter
social
neglect
and
the
beldens
that
was
the
last
straw
of
all
she
seemed
to
see
her
husband
crowded
from
his
seat
at
that
cheery
board
by
a
man
whom
he
himself
had
taken
up
and
made
a
man
who
was
trying
to
push
him
from
the
social
world
just
as
he
was
trying
to
push
him
out
of
the
control
of
the
business
which
he
had
founded
and
developed
it
was
all
more
than
she
could
bear
jane
rushed
headlong
into
another
mood
oh
well
the
end
of
the
world
has
come
if
we
frozen
out
and
perhaps
we
not
anyway
the
invite
may
get
round
who
knows
so
do
let
order
our
sackcloth
and
ashes
quite
yet
awhile
life
is
still
worth
living
and
we
have
got
several
other
strings
to
our
bow
this
one
for
instance
nodding
in
the
direction
of
rosy
towards
whom
she
seemed
inexhaustibly
forgiving
i
have
the
honor
to
present
to
the
waiting
world
miss
rosamund
marshall
the
bud
of
the
season
and
the
success
of
the
century
also
her
brother
truesdale
marshall
who
has
come
home
stuffed
full
of
accomplishments
and
who
will
now
proceed
to
show
them
he
sings
she
stepped
across
to
her
brother
slipped
her
arm
through
his
and
drew
him
towards
the
rug
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
height
was
within
an
inch
of
his
own
she
bowed
him
over
the
edge
of
the
rug
as
over
a
row
of
footlights
crooked
his
other
arm
so
that
his
hand
was
placed
over
his
heart
put
her
own
hand
sprawlingly
in
a
like
position
threw
back
her
head
and
abandoned
herself
to
a
shrill
succession
of
scales
and
roulades
why
do
you
begin
she
presently
broke
off
to
inquire
what
a
girl
you
are
he
said
he
looked
a
bit
sheepishly
in
the
direction
of
his
father
then
he
stepped
behind
his
sister
laid
a
hand
on
each
of
her
imperceptible
biceps
and
turned
her
face
round
to
the
wall
but
jane
faced
about
at
once
well
then
he
paints
she
dragged
him
toward
the
grasped
his
wrist
and
forced
him
to
make
several
dabs
and
passes
at
the
fatal
newspaper
which
still
lay
there
with
a
bland
impassivity
between
and
that
how
we
dash
off
our
little
sketches
she
declared
goodness
jane
cried
alice
you
almost
upset
the
whole
inkstand
and
what
else
is
there
cried
jane
whose
mood
was
mounting
higher
she
clamped
her
hand
on
her
disordered
bang
why
of
course
he
fences
aha
to
this
address
truesdale
allowed
himself
to
respond
he
had
no
wish
to
obtrude
his
musical
and
artistic
doings
upon
his
father
until
a
more
definite
had
been
brought
about
but
he
could
no
longer
lend
himself
passively
to
being
made
an
absurdity
by
the
of
his
sister
fencing
now
was
a
manly
art
of
which
his
father
might
not
disapprove
on
guard
he
cried
with
his
right
hand
he
snatched
up
a
from
the
table
curled
up
his
left
arm
behind
him
threw
one
of
his
long
legs
out
in
front
and
landed
it
with
a
on
the
floor
five
feet
ahead
of
his
initial
hurray
cried
jane
shrilly
what
other
girls
do
you
know
who
got
a
brother
like
this
she
snatched
up
a
ruler
that
had
lain
alongside
the
rhodes
started
back
alice
husband
who
had
come
in
to
lead
the
homeward
march
to
riverside
park
paused
astonished
on
the
threshold
on
guard
echoed
jane
in
turn
with
a
of
her
own
she
threw
herself
into
an
imitation
of
the
angular
crouch
that
her
brother
had
assumed
go
it
she
called
and
began
to
hack
at
the
with
her
ruler
save
for
the
clash
of
weapons
there
was
a
complete
silence
suddenly
truesdale
reversed
his
position
jane
did
the
same
bringing
a
sudden
and
unaccustomed
weight
upon
her
other
foot
her
knee
cracked
loudly
everybody
heard
it
rosy
snickered
jane
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
in
a
shady
corner
in
that
ten
seconds
she
felt
ten
years
older
where
pa
she
asked
her
mother
in
a
sour
tone
after
alice
and
her
aunt
had
left
the
house
i
do
hope
crossly
that
the
next
time
you
let
any
of
those
wretched
old
women
take
anything
away
you
have
them
pay
for
it
in
advance
i
guess
your
father
is
bothering
much
about
a
bedstead
and
a
few
old
chairs
retorted
her
mother
if
you
want
to
know
what
he
thinking
about
it
that
belden
again
belden
yes
he
has
decided
finally
to
let
your
father
put
on
those
two
extra
stories
and
what
do
you
think
he
wants
in
exchange
he
wants
to
make
the
firm
over
into
a
stock
company
he
fixing
a
place
for
that
boy
of
his
that
what
well
have
we
got
a
boy
too
retorted
jane
severely
she
went
out
and
gave
the
door
a
loud
slam
behind
her
but
david
marshall
back
again
in
the
was
thinking
neither
of
the
sinuosities
of
mother
van
horn
nor
of
the
aggressions
of
his
junior
partner
nor
even
of
the
courses
of
the
annual
his
thoughts
had
slipped
back
into
the
early
times
he
and
sue
lathrop
the
granger
bates
of
were
sitting
together
in
the
old
metropolitan
hall
listening
to
the
nightingale
serenaders
and
the
year
was
iv
well
here
goes
said
jane
half
aloud
with
her
foot
on
the
lowest
of
the
glistening
granite
steps
the
steps
led
up
to
the
ponderous
pillared
arches
of
a
grandiose
and
massive
porch
above
the
porch
a
sturdy
and
rugged
balustrade
half
intercepted
the
rough
faced
glitter
of
a
vast
and
variegated
fa√ßade
and
higher
still
the
morning
sun
shattered
its
beams
over
a
tumult
of
angular
roofs
and
towering
chimneys
it
swell
i
declare
said
jane
with
her
eye
on
the
work
of
the
outer
doors
and
the
jewels
and
bevels
of
the
where
is
the
anyway
she
inquired
of
herself
she
was
searching
for
the
doorbell
and
she
fell
back
on
her
own
rustic
lingo
in
order
to
ward
off
the
incipient
panic
caused
by
this
overwhelming
splendor
oh
here
it
is
there
she
gave
a
push
and
now
i
in
for
it
she
had
decided
to
take
the
richest
and
and
most
fashionable
woman
on
her
list
so
start
with
the
worst
over
at
the
beginning
she
thought
the
rest
would
follow
easily
enough
i
suppose
the
will
wear
a
cap
and
a
silver
tray
she
observed
further
or
will
it
be
a
gold
one
with
diamonds
around
the
edge
the
turned
from
within
is
bates
she
began
the
door
opened
half
way
a
grave
man
appeared
his
chin
and
upper
lip
had
the
mottled
smudge
that
shows
in
so
many
of
those
conscientious
portraits
of
the
olden
time
gracious
me
said
the
startled
jane
to
herself
she
dropped
her
disconcerted
vision
to
the
then
she
saw
that
the
man
wore
and
black
silk
stockings
heaven
be
merciful
was
her
inward
cry
it
a
footman
as
i
live
i
been
reading
about
them
all
my
life
and
now
i
met
one
but
i
never
suspected
that
there
was
really
anything
of
the
kind
in
town
she
left
the
contemplation
of
the
servant
pumps
and
stockings
and
began
to
grapple
fiercely
with
the
catch
of
her
the
man
in
the
meanwhile
studied
her
with
a
searching
gravity
and
as
it
seemed
with
some
disapproval
the
splendor
of
the
front
that
his
master
presented
to
the
world
had
indeed
intimidated
poor
jane
but
there
were
many
others
upon
whom
it
had
no
deterring
effect
at
all
some
of
these
brought
in
monthly
parts
others
brought
polish
for
the
piano
legs
many
of
them
were
quite
as
prepossessing
in
appearance
as
jane
was
some
of
them
were
much
less
plain
and
dowdy
few
of
them
were
so
recklessly
indiscreet
as
to
betray
themselves
at
the
threshold
by
exhibiting
a
black
leather
bag
there
remarked
jane
to
the
footman
i
knew
i
should
get
at
it
eventually
she
smiled
at
him
with
a
friendly
she
acknowledged
him
as
a
human
being
and
she
hoped
to
propitiate
him
into
the
concession
that
she
herself
was
nothing
less
the
man
took
her
card
which
was
fortunately
as
correct
as
the
most
discreet
and
contemporaneous
stationer
could
fashion
he
decided
that
he
was
running
no
risk
with
his
mistress
and
miss
jane
marshall
was
permitted
to
pass
the
gate
she
was
ushered
into
a
small
the
floor
was
partly
covered
by
a
meagre
persian
rug
there
was
a
plain
sofa
full
of
forbidding
angles
and
a
scantily
upholstered
chair
which
insisted
upon
nobody
remaining
longer
than
necessary
but
through
the
narrow
door
jane
caught
branching
vistas
of
room
after
room
heaped
up
with
the
pillage
of
a
sacked
and
ravaged
globe
and
of
a
stairway
which
led
with
a
wide
sweep
to
regions
of
unimaginable
glories
above
did
you
ever
exclaimed
jane
it
was
of
the
footman
that
she
was
speaking
he
in
fact
loomed
up
to
the
practical
eclipse
of
all
this
luxury
and
display
only
eighty
years
from
the
massacre
and
hardly
eight
hundred
feet
from
the
monument
presently
she
heard
a
tapping
and
a
rustling
without
she
thought
that
she
might
lean
a
few
inches
to
one
side
with
no
risk
of
being
detected
in
an
impropriety
and
she
was
rewarded
by
seeing
the
splendid
vacuity
of
the
grand
stairway
finally
filled
filled
more
completely
more
amply
than
she
could
have
imagined
possible
through
the
passage
of
one
person
merely
a
woman
of
fifty
or
more
was
descending
with
a
slow
and
somewhat
ponderous
stateliness
she
wore
an
elaborate
morning
gown
with
a
broad
plait
down
the
back
and
an
immensity
of
superfluous
material
in
the
sleeves
her
person
was
broad
her
bosom
ample
and
her
voluminous
gray
hair
was
tossed
and
fretted
about
the
temples
after
the
fashion
of
a
marquise
of
the
old
r√©gime
jane
set
her
jaw
and
clamped
her
knotty
fingers
to
the
two
edges
of
her
inhospitable
chair
i
do
care
if
she
so
rich
she
muttered
and
so
famous
and
so
fashionable
and
so
terribly
handsome
she
ca
bear
down
the
woman
reached
the
bottom
step
and
took
a
turn
that
for
a
moment
carried
her
out
of
sight
at
the
same
time
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
was
silenced
by
one
of
the
big
rugs
that
covered
the
floor
of
the
wide
and
roomy
hall
but
jane
had
had
a
glimpse
and
she
knew
with
whom
she
was
to
deal
with
one
of
the
big
the
broad
the
great
the
triumphant
with
one
of
a
roman
amplitude
and
vigor
an
indian
keenness
and
sagacity
an
american
ambition
and
determination
with
one
who
baffles
circumstance
and
almost
masters
fate
with
one
of
the
conquerors
in
short
i
do
hear
her
thought
the
expectant
girl
in
some
trepidation
but
all
the
same
she
got
to
cross
that
bare
space
just
outside
the
door
before
yes
there
her
step
and
here
she
is
herself
bates
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
had
a
strong
nose
of
the
lofty
roman
type
her
bosom
heaved
with
breaths
deep
but
quiet
and
regular
she
had
a
pair
of
large
full
blue
eyes
and
these
she
now
fixed
on
jane
with
an
expression
of
rather
cold
questioning
miss
marshall
her
voice
was
firm
smooth
even
rich
deep
she
advanced
a
foot
or
two
within
the
room
and
remained
standing
there
yes
responded
jane
in
unnecessary
corroboration
she
rose
mechanically
from
her
meagre
chair
i
have
come
to
see
you
she
began
awkwardly
about
a
charity
that
i
am
interested
in
no
not
exactly
a
charity
but
at
the
ominous
word
charity
bates
eyes
took
on
a
still
colder
gleam
she
faced
poor
jane
with
the
broad
even
pitiless
glare
of
a
mirror
really
she
began
i
have
a
great
many
demands
of
this
kind
made
on
me
a
great
many
more
than
might
generally
be
imagined
she
showed
none
of
the
embarrassed
evasion
peculiar
to
the
woman
on
whom
such
requisitions
are
made
but
at
infrequent
intervals
she
employed
the
decisive
tone
of
a
woman
of
whom
such
requests
are
made
daily
jane
seemed
to
see
negation
coldly
crystallizing
before
her
eyes
and
she
gave
a
mortified
groan
to
find
herself
drawn
so
near
to
the
brink
of
humiliation
she
had
never
begged
before
and
she
registered
an
inward
vow
never
to
beg
again
you
do
know
from
adam
she
blurted
out
at
her
bluntest
and
crudest
but
you
must
know
my
aunt
rhodes
i
have
heard
her
speak
of
you
very
often
she
met
you
at
augustine
last
winter
mrs
rhodes
the
other
repeated
doubtfully
she
made
her
eyebrows
take
their
part
in
an
inquiring
glance
and
bestowed
the
result
upon
her
caller
yes
insisted
jane
rhodes
she
lives
on
michigan
near
thirtieth
mrs
rhodes
again
thoughtfully
repeated
she
seemed
to
move
her
head
in
doubt
i
go
to
florida
every
winter
and
sometimes
on
the
way
to
our
place
i
stop
for
a
day
or
two
at
st
augustine
yes
she
looked
at
jane
again
as
if
to
say
that
is
really
the
best
i
can
do
for
you
she
played
backgammon
with
you
there
jane
still
persisted
on
the
hotel
veranda
i
heard
her
say
so
twenty
times
bates
did
not
change
her
expression
backgammon
yes
i
am
very
fond
of
backgammon
i
play
it
a
great
deal
bates
keeps
a
board
in
the
car
especially
for
me
i
always
glad
to
meet
anybody
who
cares
to
play
and
it
pleasant
i
sure
to
be
on
easy
terms
with
she
laid
one
hand
in
the
other
and
gave
an
imperceptible
sigh
she
wore
a
great
many
rings
what
more
can
i
say
for
you
than
that
such
seemed
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
expression
now
on
her
face
my
father
began
jane
she
was
loud
slow
deliberate
emphatic
what
could
the
woman
mean
by
receiving
her
in
such
a
fashion
were
the
marshalls
mere
upstarts
nobodies
newcomers
that
they
must
be
snubbed
and
turned
aside
in
any
such
way
as
this
jane
eyes
blinked
and
her
nostrils
quivered
my
father
she
began
again
in
the
same
tone
is
david
marshall
he
is
very
well
known
i
believe
in
chicago
we
have
lived
here
a
great
many
years
it
seems
to
me
that
there
ought
to
david
marshall
repeated
bates
gently
ah
i
know
david
marshall
yes
she
said
or
did
a
good
many
years
ago
she
looked
up
into
jane
face
now
with
a
completely
altered
expression
her
glance
was
curious
and
searching
but
it
was
very
kindly
and
you
are
david
marshall
daughter
she
smiled
indulgently
at
jane
outburst
of
spunk
really
david
marshall
daughter
yes
answered
jane
with
a
gruff
brevity
she
was
far
from
ready
to
be
placated
yet
david
marshall
daughter
then
my
dear
child
why
not
have
said
so
in
the
first
place
without
lugging
in
everybody
and
everything
else
you
could
think
of
has
your
father
ever
spoken
of
me
and
how
is
he
anyway
i
have
seen
him
to
really
speak
to
him
for
fifteen
years
it
may
be
even
more
she
seemed
to
have
laid
hands
on
a
heavy
bar
to
have
wrenched
it
from
its
holds
to
have
flung
it
aside
from
the
footpath
and
to
be
inviting
jane
to
advance
without
let
or
hindrance
but
jane
stood
there
with
pique
in
her
breast
and
her
long
thin
arms
laid
rigid
against
her
sides
let
her
child
me
if
she
wants
to
she
bring
me
around
in
any
such
way
as
that
all
this
however
availed
little
against
bates
new
manner
the
citadel
so
closely
sealed
to
charity
was
throwing
itself
wide
open
to
memory
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
and
the
late
enemy
was
invited
to
advance
as
a
friend
nay
urged
bates
presently
seized
jane
unwilling
hands
she
gathered
those
poor
stiff
knotted
fingers
into
two
crackling
bundles
within
her
own
plump
and
warm
palms
squeezed
them
forcibly
and
looked
into
jane
face
with
all
imaginable
kindness
i
had
just
that
temper
once
myself
she
said
the
of
caution
and
reserve
were
opening
wide
the
streams
of
tenderness
and
sympathy
were
bubbling
and
fretting
to
take
their
course
and
your
father
is
well
and
you
are
living
in
the
same
old
place
oh
this
terrible
town
you
ca
keep
your
old
friends
you
can
hardly
know
your
new
ones
we
are
only
a
mile
or
two
apart
and
yet
it
is
the
same
as
if
it
were
a
hundred
jane
yielded
up
her
hands
half
unwillingly
she
could
not
in
spite
of
herself
remain
completely
unrelenting
but
she
was
determined
not
to
permit
herself
to
be
patronized
yes
we
live
in
the
same
old
place
and
in
the
same
old
way
she
added
in
the
spirit
of
concession
bates
studied
her
face
intently
do
you
look
like
him
like
your
father
no
answered
jane
not
so
very
much
nor
like
any
of
the
rest
of
the
family
the
statue
was
beginning
to
melt
i
unique
and
another
drop
fell
do
slander
yourself
she
tapped
jane
lightly
on
the
shoulder
jane
looked
at
her
with
a
protesting
or
at
least
a
questioning
seriousness
it
had
the
usual
effect
of
a
wild
stare
i
was
meaning
to
she
said
shortly
and
began
to
congeal
again
she
also
shrugged
her
shoulder
she
was
not
quite
ready
yet
to
be
tapped
and
patted
but
do
remain
standing
child
bates
proceeded
genially
she
motioned
jane
back
to
her
chair
and
herself
advanced
to
the
roomier
sofa
or
no
this
little
pen
is
like
a
refrigerator
it
so
hard
every
fall
to
get
the
steam
heat
running
as
it
should
come
it
ought
to
be
warmer
in
the
the
fact
is
she
proceeded
as
they
passed
through
the
hall
that
i
have
a
spare
hour
on
my
hands
this
morning
the
first
in
a
month
my
has
just
sent
word
that
she
is
down
with
a
cold
you
shall
have
as
much
of
that
hour
as
you
wish
so
tell
me
all
about
your
plans
i
dare
say
i
can
scrape
together
a
few
pennies
for
jane
marshall
her
thought
jane
she
was
not
yet
so
far
appeased
nor
so
far
forgetful
of
her
own
initial
awkwardness
as
to
refrain
from
searching
out
the
joints
in
the
other
armor
what
does
a
woman
of
want
to
be
taking
for
the
was
a
lofty
and
spacious
apartment
done
completely
in
its
panelled
walls
and
ceiling
rang
with
a
magnificent
sonority
as
the
two
pairs
of
feet
moved
across
the
marquetry
of
the
floor
to
one
side
stood
a
its
case
was
so
unique
and
so
luxurious
that
even
jane
was
conscious
of
its
having
been
made
by
special
order
and
from
a
special
design
close
at
hand
stood
a
tall
in
style
to
correspond
it
was
laden
with
handsomely
bound
scores
of
all
the
german
classics
and
the
usual
operas
of
the
french
and
italian
schools
these
were
all
ranged
in
precise
order
nothing
there
seemed
to
have
been
disturbed
for
a
year
past
my
is
it
grand
sighed
jane
she
already
felt
herself
succumbing
beneath
these
accumulated
splendors
bates
carelessly
seated
herself
on
the
with
her
back
to
the
instrument
i
do
suppose
she
observed
casually
that
i
have
sat
down
here
for
a
month
what
cried
jane
with
a
stare
if
i
had
such
a
lovely
room
as
this
i
should
play
in
it
every
day
dear
me
rejoined
bates
what
pleasure
could
i
get
from
practising
in
this
great
barn
of
a
place
that
is
half
full
until
you
got
seventy
or
eighty
people
in
it
or
on
this
big
sprawling
thing
thrusting
out
her
elbow
backward
towards
the
shimmering
cover
of
the
so
then
said
jane
to
herself
it
all
for
show
i
knew
it
was
i
do
believe
she
can
play
a
single
note
what
do
you
suppose
happened
to
me
last
winter
bates
went
on
i
had
the
greatest
setback
of
my
life
i
asked
to
join
the
amateur
musical
club
they
would
let
me
in
why
not
well
i
played
before
their
committee
and
then
the
secretary
wrote
me
a
note
it
was
a
nice
enough
note
of
course
but
i
knew
what
it
meant
i
see
now
well
enough
that
my
fingers
were
rather
stiffer
than
i
realized
and
that
my
sprays
and
zephyrs
were
not
quite
up
to
date
they
wanted
grieg
and
lassen
and
chopin
well
said
i
wait
now
i
never
knuckle
under
i
never
give
up
so
i
sent
right
out
for
a
teacher
i
practised
scales
an
hour
a
day
for
weeks
and
months
granger
thought
i
was
going
crazy
i
tackled
grieg
and
lassen
and
chopin
yes
and
tschaikowsky
too
i
going
to
play
for
that
committee
next
month
let
me
see
if
they
dare
to
vote
me
out
again
oh
it
thought
jane
she
was
beginning
to
feel
desirous
of
meting
out
exact
and
even
handed
justice
she
found
it
impossible
to
withhold
respect
from
so
much
grit
and
determination
but
your
father
liked
those
things
and
so
did
all
the
other
young
men
bates
creased
and
folded
the
end
of
one
of
her
long
sleeves
and
seemed
lapsing
into
a
retrospective
mood
why
some
evenings
they
used
to
sit
two
deep
around
the
room
to
hear
me
do
the
of
prague
do
you
know
the
march
she
asked
suddenly
i
afraid
not
jane
was
obliged
to
confess
you
father
always
had
a
great
fondness
for
that
i
do
know
she
went
on
after
a
short
pause
whether
you
understand
that
your
father
was
one
of
my
old
beaux
at
least
i
always
counted
him
with
the
rest
i
was
a
gay
girl
in
my
day
and
i
wanted
to
make
the
list
as
long
as
i
could
so
i
counted
in
the
quiet
ones
as
well
as
the
noisy
ones
your
father
was
one
of
the
quiet
ones
so
i
should
have
imagined
said
jane
her
maiden
delicacy
was
just
a
shade
affrighted
at
the
turn
the
talk
was
taking
when
i
was
playing
he
would
sit
there
by
the
hour
and
never
say
a
word
my
banner
piece
was
really
a
fantasia
on
a
new
thing
here
i
was
the
first
one
in
town
to
have
it
there
were
thirteen
pages
and
there
was
always
a
rush
to
see
who
should
turn
them
your
father
often
enter
the
rush
but
i
really
liked
his
way
of
turning
the
best
of
any
he
never
turned
too
soon
or
too
late
he
never
bothered
me
by
shifting
his
feet
every
second
or
two
nor
by
talking
to
me
at
the
hard
places
in
fact
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
do
it
right
yes
said
jane
with
an
appreciative
sigh
that
pa
all
over
bates
was
twisting
her
long
sleeves
around
her
wrists
presently
she
shivered
slightly
well
really
she
said
i
do
see
that
this
place
is
much
warmer
than
the
other
let
try
the
library
in
this
room
our
antique
and
spartan
jane
was
made
to
feel
the
need
of
yet
stronger
props
to
hold
her
up
against
the
overbearing
weight
of
magnificence
she
found
herself
surrounded
now
by
a
sombre
and
solid
splendor
stamped
hangings
of
cordova
leather
lined
the
walls
around
whose
bases
ran
a
low
range
of
ornate
bookcases
constructed
with
the
utmost
taste
and
skill
of
the
art
in
the
centre
of
the
room
a
wide
and
substantial
table
was
set
with
all
the
paraphernalia
of
correspondence
and
the
leathery
abysses
of
three
or
four
vast
invited
the
reader
to
bookish
how
glorious
cried
jane
as
her
eyes
ranged
over
the
ranks
and
rows
of
formal
and
costly
bindings
it
all
seemed
doubly
glorious
after
that
poor
sole
bookcase
of
theirs
at
home
a
huge
thing
like
a
wardrobe
with
a
couple
of
drawers
at
the
bottom
receptacles
that
seemed
less
adapted
to
pamphlets
than
to
goloshes
how
grand
jane
was
not
exigent
as
regarded
music
but
her
whole
being
went
forth
towards
books
dickens
and
thackeray
and
bulwer
and
hume
and
gibbon
and
of
the
and
and
twenty
or
thirty
yards
of
scott
bates
broke
in
genially
and
enough
encyclopaedia
britannica
to
reach
around
the
corner
and
back
again
sets
sets
sets
what
a
lovely
chair
to
sit
and
study
in
cried
jane
not
at
all
abashed
by
her
hostess
comments
what
a
grand
table
to
sit
and
write
papers
at
writing
papers
was
one
of
jane
chief
interests
oh
yes
said
bates
with
a
quiet
toleration
as
she
glanced
towards
the
shining
inkstand
and
the
immaculate
but
really
i
do
suppose
i
written
two
lines
at
that
table
since
it
was
put
there
and
as
for
all
these
books
heaven
only
knows
where
the
keys
are
to
get
at
them
with
i
ca
do
anything
with
them
why
some
of
them
weigh
five
or
six
pounds
jane
shrivelled
and
shivered
under
this
she
regretted
doubly
that
she
had
been
betrayed
into
such
an
unstinted
expression
of
her
honest
interest
all
for
show
and
display
she
muttered
as
she
bowed
her
head
to
search
out
new
titles
bought
by
the
pound
and
stacked
by
the
cord
doing
nobody
any
good
their
owners
least
of
all
she
resolved
to
admire
openly
nothing
more
whatever
bates
sank
into
one
of
the
big
chairs
and
motioned
jane
towards
another
your
father
was
a
great
reader
she
said
with
a
resumption
of
her
retrospective
expression
he
was
very
fond
of
books
especially
poetry
he
often
read
aloud
to
me
when
he
thought
i
was
likely
to
be
alone
he
would
bring
his
shakespeare
over
i
believe
i
could
give
you
even
now
if
i
was
put
to
it
antony
address
to
the
romans
yes
and
almost
all
of
hamlet
soliloquies
too
jane
was
preparing
to
make
a
stand
against
this
woman
and
here
apparently
was
the
opportunity
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
she
inquired
with
something
approaching
sternness
that
my
father
was
ever
fond
of
poetry
and
and
music
and
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
certainly
why
not
i
remember
your
father
as
a
young
man
with
a
great
deal
of
good
taste
i
always
thought
him
much
above
the
average
and
that
shakespeare
of
his
i
recall
it
perfectly
it
was
a
chubby
little
book
bound
in
brown
leather
with
an
embossed
stamp
and
print
a
great
deal
too
fine
for
always
had
to
do
the
reading
and
he
read
very
pleasantly
she
scanned
jane
closely
perhaps
you
have
never
done
your
father
justice
jane
felt
herself
driven
to
defence
even
to
apology
the
fact
is
she
said
pa
is
so
quiet
he
never
says
much
of
anything
i
about
the
only
one
of
the
family
who
knows
him
very
well
and
i
guess
i
do
know
him
any
too
well
she
felt
though
that
bates
had
no
right
to
defend
her
father
against
his
own
daughter
no
nor
any
need
i
suppose
so
said
bates
slowly
she
crossed
over
to
the
radiator
and
began
working
at
the
valve
i
granger
i
knew
he
be
sorry
if
he
did
put
in
too
i
really
ca
ask
you
to
take
your
things
off
down
here
let
go
upstairs
that
the
only
warm
place
i
can
think
of
she
paused
in
the
hall
would
you
like
to
see
the
rest
of
the
rooms
before
you
go
up
yes
i
do
mind
responded
jane
she
was
determined
to
encourage
no
ostentatious
pride
so
she
made
her
acceptance
as
indifferent
as
she
felt
good
manners
would
allow
bates
crossed
over
the
hall
and
paused
in
a
wide
doorway
this
she
indicated
in
a
tone
slightly
suggestive
of
the
cicerone
is
the
well
the
grand
salon
at
least
that
what
the
newspapers
have
decided
to
call
it
do
you
care
anything
for
louis
quinze
jane
found
herself
on
the
threshold
of
a
long
and
glittering
apartment
it
was
full
of
the
ornate
and
complicated
embellishments
of
the
eighteenth
century
an
exhibition
of
decorative
grilles
panels
all
glimmered
in
green
and
gold
and
a
row
of
lustres
each
multitudinously
candled
hung
from
the
lofty
ceiling
jane
felt
herself
on
firmer
ground
here
than
in
the
library
whose
general
air
of
distinction
with
no
definite
detail
by
way
of
guidepost
had
rather
baffled
her
hem
she
observed
critically
as
her
eyes
roamed
over
the
spacious
spendor
of
the
place
quite
an
epitome
of
the
whole
rococo
period
done
too
with
a
french
grace
and
a
german
thoroughness
almost
a
real
in
fact
very
handsome
indeed
bates
pricked
up
her
ears
she
had
not
expected
quite
such
a
response
as
this
you
are
posted
on
these
things
then
well
said
jane
i
belong
to
an
art
class
we
study
the
different
periods
in
architecture
and
decoration
do
you
i
belong
to
just
such
a
class
myself
and
to
three
or
four
others
i
studying
and
learning
right
along
i
never
want
to
stand
still
you
were
surprised
i
saw
about
my
it
a
little
singular
i
admit
my
beginning
as
a
teacher
and
ending
as
a
pupil
you
know
of
course
that
i
a
yes
i
had
a
little
class
down
on
wabash
avenue
near
hubbard
court
in
a
church
basement
i
began
to
be
useful
as
early
as
i
could
we
lived
in
a
little
bit
of
a
house
a
couple
of
blocks
north
of
there
you
know
those
frame
cottages
one
of
them
in
the
early
days
pa
was
a
carpenter
a
to
do
him
full
justice
the
town
was
growing
and
after
a
while
he
began
to
do
but
at
the
beginning
ma
did
her
own
work
and
i
helped
her
i
swept
and
dusted
and
wiped
the
dishes
she
taught
me
to
sew
too
i
trimmed
all
my
own
hats
till
long
after
i
was
married
bates
leaned
carelessly
against
the
tortured
framework
of
a
tapestried
the
light
from
the
lofty
windows
shattered
on
the
prisms
of
her
glittering
chandeliers
and
diffused
itself
over
the
panelled
loves
and
graces
around
her
when
i
got
to
be
eighteen
i
thought
i
was
old
enough
to
branch
out
and
do
something
for
myself
i
always
tried
to
hold
up
my
own
end
my
little
school
went
there
was
only
one
drawback
another
school
next
door
full
of
great
rowdy
boys
they
would
climb
the
fence
and
make
faces
at
my
scholars
yes
and
sometimes
they
would
throw
stones
but
that
was
the
worst
the
other
school
taught
now
i
never
was
one
of
the
kind
to
lag
behind
and
i
used
to
lie
awake
nights
wondering
how
i
could
catch
up
with
the
rival
institution
well
i
hustled
around
and
finally
i
got
hold
of
two
or
three
children
who
were
old
enough
for
accounts
and
i
set
them
to
work
on
single
entry
i
do
know
whether
they
learned
anything
but
did
enough
to
keep
granger
books
for
the
first
year
after
we
started
out
jane
smiled
broadly
it
was
useless
to
set
a
stoic
face
against
such
confidences
as
these
we
were
married
at
the
most
fashionable
church
in
town
right
there
in
square
and
ma
gave
us
a
reception
or
something
like
it
in
her
little
front
room
we
were
so
very
stylish
ourselves
but
we
had
some
awfully
stylish
neighbors
all
those
terrace
row
people
just
around
the
corner
get
there
too
some
time
i
said
to
granger
is
going
to
be
a
big
town
and
we
have
a
good
show
to
be
big
people
in
it
do
let
start
in
life
like
beggars
going
to
the
back
door
for
cold
victuals
let
march
right
up
the
front
steps
and
ring
the
bell
somebody
so
as
i
say
we
were
married
at
the
best
church
in
town
we
thought
it
safe
enough
to
discount
the
future
good
for
you
said
jane
who
was
finding
her
true
self
in
the
thick
of
these
intimate
revelations
you
guessed
right
well
we
worked
along
fairly
for
a
year
or
two
and
finally
i
said
to
granger
what
the
use
of
inventing
things
and
taking
them
to
those
companies
and
making
everybody
rich
but
yourself
you
pick
out
some
one
road
and
get
on
the
inside
of
that
and
stick
there
and
the
fact
is
she
broke
off
suddenly
you
ca
judge
at
all
of
this
room
in
the
daytime
you
must
see
it
lighted
and
filled
with
people
you
ought
to
have
been
here
at
the
i
gave
last
season
lots
of
pretty
girls
in
laces
and
brocades
and
powder
on
their
hair
it
was
a
lovely
sight
it
must
have
been
i
believe
rosy
would
have
looked
real
pretty
fixed
up
that
way
rosy
our
youngest
she
eighteen
is
she
out
not
quite
but
i
expect
she
on
the
way
is
she
pretty
yes
replied
the
just
jane
yes
rosy
is
quite
pretty
she
dark
she
would
look
lovely
in
yellow
tulle
with
a
red
rose
somewhere
is
she
clever
h
said
jane
thoughtfully
i
suppose
so
she
beginning
to
understand
how
to
get
what
she
wants
anyway
and
just
the
least
bit
selfish
and
inconsiderate
insinuated
bates
shrewdly
y
yes
i
afraid
so
well
she
might
be
quite
a
success
we
must
think
about
her
come
had
enough
of
this
bates
turned
a
careless
back
upon
all
her
louis
quinze
spendor
the
next
thing
will
be
something
else
v
jane
guide
passed
swiftly
into
another
large
and
imposing
apartment
this
i
call
the
sala
de
los
embajadores
here
is
where
i
receive
my
distinguished
guests
good
cried
jane
who
knew
irving
by
heart
only
it
moorish
it
baroque
and
a
very
good
example
the
room
had
a
heavy
panelled
ceiling
of
dark
wood
with
a
cartouche
in
each
panel
stacks
of
armor
stood
in
the
corners
half
a
dozen
large
aubusson
tapestries
hung
on
the
walls
and
a
vast
fireplace
flanked
by
huge
atlantes
and
crowned
by
a
heavy
pediment
broken
and
curled
almost
filled
one
whole
side
that
fireplace
is
baroque
all
over
see
here
said
bates
suddenly
are
you
the
woman
who
read
about
the
decadence
of
the
renaissance
forms
at
the
last
fortnightly
i
the
woman
responded
jane
modestly
i
do
know
why
i
did
recognize
you
before
but
you
sat
in
an
awfully
bad
light
for
one
thing
besides
i
had
so
much
on
my
mind
that
day
our
dear
little
reginald
was
coming
down
with
something
or
so
we
thought
and
the
bonnet
i
was
forced
to
wear
well
it
just
made
me
blue
you
did
notice
it
i
was
too
flustered
to
notice
anything
it
was
my
first
time
there
well
it
was
a
good
paper
although
i
could
half
pay
attention
to
it
it
gave
me
several
new
notions
all
my
decorations
then
you
think
them
corrupt
and
degraded
well
returned
jane
at
once
soothing
and
judicial
all
these
later
forms
are
interesting
from
an
historical
and
sociological
point
of
view
and
lots
of
people
find
them
beautiful
too
for
that
matter
jane
slid
over
these
big
words
with
a
practised
ease
they
impressed
my
notables
anyway
retorted
bates
we
entertained
a
great
deal
during
the
fair
it
was
expected
of
course
from
people
of
our
position
we
had
princes
and
counts
and
honorables
without
end
i
remember
how
delighted
i
was
with
my
first
prince
a
russian
h
later
in
the
season
russian
princes
were
as
plentiful
as
blackberries
you
stepped
on
one
at
every
turn
we
had
some
of
the
english
too
one
of
their
young
men
visited
us
at
geneva
during
the
summer
i
never
quite
made
out
who
invited
him
i
have
half
an
idea
that
he
invited
himself
he
was
a
great
trial
queer
about
the
english
it
how
can
people
who
are
so
clever
and
capable
in
practical
things
ever
be
such
insolent
in
social
things
do
you
know
arthur
paston
no
was
he
one
of
them
not
exactly
he
lives
here
we
thought
we
had
americanized
him
but
now
he
has
slipped
back
and
is
almost
as
bad
as
he
was
to
start
with
arthur
that
the
way
his
cards
read
do
you
care
for
paintings
of
course
is
arthur
like
one
you
bad
girl
well
we
might
just
stick
our
noses
in
the
for
a
minute
we
almost
beginners
in
this
branch
of
industry
she
expounded
as
she
stood
beside
jane
in
the
center
of
the
room
under
the
coldly
diffused
glare
of
the
skylight
in
my
young
days
it
was
all
bierstadt
and
de
haas
there
was
supposed
to
be
anything
beyond
but
as
soon
as
i
began
to
hear
about
millet
and
the
barbizon
crowd
i
saw
there
was
well
i
set
to
work
as
usual
i
studied
and
learned
i
to
learn
i
want
to
move
i
want
to
keep
right
up
with
the
times
and
the
people
i
got
books
and
photographs
and
i
went
to
all
the
galleries
i
read
the
biographies
and
took
in
all
the
loan
collections
now
i
loaning
too
some
of
these
things
are
going
to
the
art
institute
next
week
that
daubigny
for
one
it
little
but
it
good
there
could
be
anything
more
like
him
could
there
we
have
got
any
millet
yet
but
that
morning
thing
over
there
is
a
corot
at
least
we
think
so
i
was
going
to
ask
one
of
the
french
commissioners
about
it
last
summer
but
my
nerve
gave
out
at
the
last
minute
bates
bought
it
on
his
own
responsibility
i
let
him
go
ahead
for
after
all
people
of
our
position
would
naturally
be
expected
to
have
a
corot
i
do
dare
tell
you
what
he
paid
for
it
if
i
did
she
pointed
to
their
joint
reflection
in
the
opposite
mirror
we
should
have
a
fretful
porcupine
here
in
no
time
do
then
pleaded
jane
looking
at
her
own
reflection
and
clasping
her
hands
across
her
forehead
this
miserable
bang
gives
me
enough
trouble
as
it
is
there
some
more
high
art
said
bates
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
towards
the
opposite
wall
fifty
thousand
francs
and
he
would
let
me
pick
out
my
own
costume
either
you
have
never
seen
me
on
take
a
look
at
me
now
she
gathered
up
the
tail
of
her
gown
and
modestly
scuttled
out
of
the
room
poor
dowdy
jane
stood
in
silent
awe
before
this
sumptuous
canvas
with
her
long
interlaced
fingers
strenuously
tugging
at
each
other
and
her
wide
eyes
half
popping
from
her
head
she
was
as
completely
overpowered
and
shattered
as
an
uncouth
and
angular
raft
under
the
thunderous
downpour
of
niagara
presently
she
turned
bates
stood
peeping
in
from
without
her
eyes
all
and
now
she
said
let
go
jane
followed
her
too
dazed
to
speak
or
even
to
smile
bates
hastened
forward
lightfootedly
conservatory
moorish
she
indicated
casually
nothing
in
it
but
orchids
and
things
come
along
jane
followed
dumbly
humbly
bates
paused
on
the
lower
step
of
her
great
stairway
a
huge
vase
of
japanese
bronze
flanked
either
newel
and
a
turkish
lantern
depended
above
her
head
the
bright
green
of
a
dwarf
palm
peeped
over
the
balustrade
and
a
tempered
light
strained
down
through
the
painted
window
on
the
there
she
said
you
seen
it
all
she
stood
there
in
a
kind
of
impassioned
splendor
her
jewelled
fingers
shut
tightly
and
her
fists
thrown
out
and
apart
so
as
to
show
the
veins
and
cords
of
her
wrists
did
it
we
two
just
granger
and
i
nothing
but
our
own
hands
and
hearts
and
hopes
and
each
other
we
have
fought
the
fight
a
fair
field
and
no
favor
and
we
have
come
out
ahead
and
we
shall
stay
there
too
keep
up
with
the
procession
is
my
motto
and
head
it
if
you
can
i
head
it
and
i
feel
that
i
where
i
belong
when
i
ca
foot
it
with
the
rest
let
me
drop
by
the
wayside
and
the
crows
have
me
but
never
get
me
never
there
ten
more
good
years
in
me
yet
and
if
we
were
to
slip
to
the
bottom
we
should
work
back
to
the
top
again
before
we
finished
when
i
led
the
grand
march
at
the
charity
ball
i
was
accused
of
taking
a
vainglorious
part
in
a
vainglorious
show
well
who
would
look
better
in
such
a
r√¥le
than
i
or
who
has
earned
a
better
right
to
play
it
there
child
ai
that
success
ai
that
glory
ai
that
poetry
h
she
broke
off
suddenly
i
glad
jimmy
by
to
hear
that
he
always
taking
up
his
poor
mother
jimmy
is
he
do
you
mean
one
of
my
boys
no
indeed
grammatical
that
all
he
prefers
come
up
bates
hurried
her
guest
over
the
stairway
and
through
several
halls
and
passages
and
introduced
her
finally
into
a
large
and
spacious
room
done
in
white
and
gold
in
the
glittering
electrolier
wires
mingled
with
pipes
and
bulbs
with
globes
to
one
side
stood
a
massive
brass
bedstead
full
panoplied
in
coverlet
and
and
the
mirror
of
the
reflected
a
formal
row
of
brushes
and
combs
my
bedroom
said
bates
how
does
it
strike
you
why
stammered
jane
it
all
very
fine
but
oh
yes
i
know
what
they
say
about
it
i
heard
them
a
dozen
times
very
big
and
handsome
and
all
but
not
a
bit
should
want
to
sleep
here
is
that
the
idea
about
said
jane
sleep
here
echoed
bates
i
sleep
here
i
as
soon
think
of
sleeping
out
on
the
prairie
that
bed
is
to
in
it
for
the
women
to
lay
their
hats
and
cloaks
on
lay
yours
there
now
jane
obeyed
she
worked
herself
out
of
her
old
blue
sack
and
disposed
it
neatly
folded
on
the
brocaded
coverlet
then
she
took
off
her
mussy
little
turban
and
placed
it
on
the
sack
what
a
strange
woman
she
murmured
to
herself
she
does
get
any
music
out
of
her
piano
she
does
get
any
reading
out
of
her
books
she
does
even
get
any
sleep
out
of
her
bed
jane
smoothed
down
her
hair
and
awaited
the
next
stage
of
her
adventure
this
is
the
way
bates
led
her
through
a
narrow
and
jane
found
herself
in
a
small
room
where
another
young
woman
sat
before
a
trim
desk
whose
drawers
and
pigeonholes
were
stuffed
with
cards
and
letters
and
papers
this
is
my
office
miss
marshall
miss
peters
she
said
in
the
tone
of
introduction
the
other
girl
rose
she
was
tall
and
slender
like
jane
she
had
a
pasty
complexion
and
weak
reddish
eyes
her
expression
was
somewhat
plaintive
and
distressed
irritating
too
in
the
long
run
step
along
called
bates
she
traversed
the
office
passed
into
a
room
beyond
pushed
jane
ahead
of
her
and
shut
the
door
i
do
care
if
it
hurt
her
feelings
bates
reference
appeared
to
be
to
miss
peters
the
door
closed
with
a
light
click
and
jane
looked
about
her
with
a
great
and
sudden
surprise
poor
stupid
stumbling
child
she
understood
at
last
in
what
spirit
she
had
been
received
and
on
what
footing
she
had
been
placed
she
found
herself
in
a
small
cramped
room
which
was
filled
with
worn
and
antiquated
furniture
there
was
a
ponderous
old
mahogany
bureau
with
the
veneering
cracked
and
peeled
and
a
bed
to
correspond
there
was
a
shabby
little
whose
lid
was
lined
with
faded
and
blotted
green
baize
on
the
floor
there
was
an
old
brussels
carpet
antique
as
to
pattern
and
wholly
threadbare
as
to
surface
the
walls
were
covered
with
an
paper
whose
plaintive
primitiveness
ran
in
slender
pink
stripes
alternating
with
narrow
green
vines
in
one
corner
stood
a
small
upright
piano
whose
top
was
littered
with
loose
sheets
of
old
music
and
on
one
wall
hung
a
set
of
thin
shelves
strung
together
with
cords
and
loaded
with
a
variety
of
volumes
in
the
grate
was
a
coal
fire
bates
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
motioned
jane
to
a
small
rocker
that
had
been
with
a
bit
of
old
rugging
and
now
she
said
cheerily
let
get
to
business
sue
bates
at
your
service
oh
no
gasped
jane
who
felt
however
dumbly
and
mistily
that
this
was
an
epoch
in
her
life
not
here
not
why
not
go
ahead
tell
me
all
about
the
charity
that
is
a
charity
you
better
this
is
the
last
room
there
nothing
beyond
her
eyes
were
twinkling
but
immensely
kind
i
know
it
stammered
jane
i
knew
it
in
a
second
she
felt
too
that
not
a
dozen
persons
had
ever
penetrated
to
this
little
chamber
how
good
you
are
to
me
presently
under
some
compulsion
she
was
making
an
exposition
of
her
small
plans
bates
was
made
to
understand
how
some
of
the
old
dearborn
seminary
girls
were
trying
to
start
a
sort
of
clubroom
in
some
convenient
building
for
typewriters
and
saleswomen
and
others
employed
in
business
there
was
to
be
a
room
where
they
could
get
lunch
or
bring
their
own
to
eat
if
they
preferred
also
a
parlor
where
they
could
fill
up
their
noon
hour
with
talk
or
reading
or
music
it
was
the
expectation
to
have
a
piano
and
a
few
books
and
magazines
i
remembered
lottie
as
one
of
the
girls
who
went
with
us
there
down
on
old
dearborn
place
and
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
interest
mother
concluded
jane
and
so
you
can
said
lottie
mother
promptly
i
have
miss
peters
but
do
you
find
it
a
little
warm
here
just
pass
me
that
bates
had
stepped
to
her
single
little
window
is
it
a
gem
she
asked
i
had
it
made
to
order
one
of
the
sort
you
see
two
sash
with
six
little
panes
in
each
no
weights
and
cords
but
simply
catches
at
the
side
it
opens
to
just
two
widths
if
i
want
anything
different
i
have
to
contrive
it
for
myself
sometimes
i
use
a
and
sometimes
a
dear
me
asked
jane
is
that
sort
of
thing
a
rarity
every
window
in
our
house
is
like
this
i
prop
mine
with
a
and
now
said
bates
resuming
how
much
is
it
going
to
take
to
start
things

should
think
that
five
hundred
dollars
would
do
to
get
you
under
way
she
opened
the
door
miss
peters
wo

please
make

cried
jane

one
woman

hundred

bates

the
next
room

at
jane
quizzically

protested
jane
the
door
closed
on
miss
peters
bates
dropped
her
voice
did
you

private
secretary

matter
how
many
engagements
and
appointments
and

and
dates

to
have
you
never

happy
day
afterwards
tutors

bad
enough
but
thank
goodness
my
boys
are
past
that
age
and
men
servants
are
bad
enough
every
time
i
want
to
stir
in
my
own
house
i
seem
to
have
a
footman
on
each
toe
and
a
butler
standing
on
my
train
however
people
in
our
position
well
granger
insists
you
know
but
minnie
peters
minnie
peters
is
the
worst
of
all
every
so
often
in
a
low
voice
and
with
her
eye
on
the
door
she
has
one
of
her
humble
days
and
then
i
want
to
die
that
was
what
was
the
matter
before
you
came
i
did
really
mean
to
seem
cross
to
you
i
just
have
to
take
her
and
shake
her
and
say
minnie
peters
how
can
you
be
so
bad
to
me
how
can
you
think
i
would
do
anything
to
hurt
your
feelings
when
your
mother
was
my
very
best
friend
why
are
you
always
looking
for
a
chance
to
find
a
slight
when
oh
thanks
thanks
miss
peters
having
appeared
with
the
check
bates
clapped
on
the
signature
at
her
little
old
desk
there
my
child
and
to
the
and
now
business
is
over
she
continued
do
you
like
my
posies
she
nodded
towards
the
window
where
thanks
to
the
a
row
of
flowers
in
a
long
narrow
box
blew
about
in
the
draught
asters
no
no
no
but
i
hoped
you
guess
asters
they
chrysanthemums
you
see
fashion
will
penetrate
even
here
but
they
the
smallest
and
simplest
i
could
find
what
do
i
care
for
orchids
and
american
beauties
and
all
those
other
expensive
things
under
glass
how
much
does
it
please
me
to
have
two
great
big
formal
beds
of
gladiolus
and
foliage
plants
in
the
front
yard
one
on
each
side
of
the
steps
still
with
our
position
i
suppose
it
ca
be
helped
no
what
i
want
is
a
bed
of
portulacca
and
some
cypress
vines
running
up
strings
to
the
top
of
a
pole
as
soon
as
i
get
poor
enough
to
afford
it
i
going
to
have
a
lot
of
phlox
and
london
pride
and
bachelor
buttons
out
there
in
the
back
yard
and
the
girls
can
run
their
clotheslines
somewhere
else
it
hard
to
keep
flowers
in
a
city
said
jane
i
know
it
is
at
our
old
house
we
had
such
a
nice
little
rosebush
in
the
front
yard
i
hated
so
to
leave
it
behind
one
of
those
little
yellow
no
it
was
yellow
it
was
just
and
it
always
scratched
my
nose
when
i
tried
to
smell
it
but
oh
child
wistfully
if
i
could
only
smell
it
now
could
you
have
transplanted
it
asked
jane
sympathetically
i
went
back
the
very
next
day
after
we
moved
out
with
a
and
a
but
my
poor
bush
was
buried
under
seven
feet
of
yellow
sand
there
seven
stories
of
brick
and
mortar
so
all
i
got
from
the
old
place
is
just
this
furniture
of
ma
and
the
the
not
the
identical
same
of
course
it
like
what
i
had
in
my
bedroom
when
i
was
a
girl
i
remembered
the
pattern
and
tried
everywhere
to
match
it
at
first
i
just
tried
on
street
then
i
went
then
i
tried
all
the
little
places
away
out
on
the
west
side
then
i
had
the
pattern
put
down
on
paper
and
i
made
a
tour
of
the
country
i
went
to
belvidere
and
to
beloit
and
to
janesville
and
to
lots
of
other
places
between
here
and
geneva
and
finally
well
what
finally
finally
i
sent
down
east
and
had
eight
or
ten
rolls
made
to
order
i
chased
harder
than
anybody
ever
chased
for
a
raphael
and
i
spent
more
than
if
i
had
hung
the
room
with
gobelins
but
she
stroked
the
narrow
strips
of
pink
and
green
with
a
fond
hand
and
cast
on
jane
a
look
which
pleaded
indulgence
is
it
just
too
quaintly
ugly
for
anything
it
is
any
such
thing
cried
jane
it
just
as
sweet
as
it
can
be
i
only
wish
mine
was
like
it
bates
glanced
from
the
to
the
and
from
the
window
down
into
the
back
yard
where
beneath
the
week
washing
flapping
in
the
breeze
and
the
sun
she
saw
next
summer
flowers
already
blooming
did
you
read
that
paragraph
last
week
she
asked
suddenly
about
my
having
been
a
once
no
what
was
it
in
one
of
those
miserable
society
papers
do
you
know
there
a
man
in
this
town
who
makes
his
living
by
sending
such
things
to
new
york
something
scandalous
if
possible
if
not
scandalous
then
libellous
if
not
actually
libellous
then
derogatory
and
offensive
i
never
read
such
stuff
said
jane
especially
about
people
i
like
i
always
skip
it
yes
but
it
true
i
ca
deny
it
i
a
washerwoman
for
a
whole
year
i
washed
all
granger
shirts
and
starched
them
and
ironed
them
and
put
them
away
and
got
them
out
and
washed
them
again
for
months
and
months
every
one
went
through
the
mill
pretty
often
too
there
very
many
of
them
those
are
granger
shirts
out
on
the
line
there
now
the
big
ones
those
in
the
other
row
are
jimmy
the
little
ones
h
observed
jane
standing
beside
her
at
the
window
which
the
little
ones
bates
laughed
well
perhaps
there
is
much
difference
jimmy
is
eighteen
and
large
for
his
age
but
of
course
his
the
littlest
i
had
them
made
in
the
house
but
he
set
off
to
college
before
i
could
finish
with
them
perhaps
they
just
as
well
here
until
the
sophomores
have
finished
with
yes
she
went
on
proudly
i
could
wash
shirts
then
and
i
can
make
shirts
now
a
woman
it
seems
to
me
may
do
anything
for
herself
or
for
those
belonging
to
her
and
i
always
tried
to
be
a
lady
and
a
woman
too
i
made
all
jimmy
and
worked
all
the
initials
on
the
tabs
she
looked
appealingly
at
jane
i
know
you
think
i
a
silly
old
thing
i
do
either
cried
jane
loudly
with
a
tremble
on
her
lip
and
a
hot
tear
starting
in
each
eye
i
do
either
you
know
i
do
you
know
what
i
think
you
a
dear
good
lovely
woman
and
i
been
just
as
mean
and
hateful
to
you
as
i
could
i
do
see
she
went
on
in
a
great
burst
on
contrition
how
you
could
talk
to
me
i
do
see
how
you
could
let
me
stay
one
minute
in
your
house
if
you
only
knew
all
the
mean
ugly
uncharitable
things
i
have
thought
about
you
since
that
man
let
me
in
how
could
you
stand
me
how
could
you
keep
from
having
me
turned
out
i
am
used
to
being
misunderstood
said
bates
quietly
i
took
you
at
first
for
your
father
sake
and
i
kept
you
for
your
own
it
a
long
time
since
i
have
met
a
girl
like
you
i
did
suppose
there
was
one
left
in
the
whole
town
you
are
one
of
the
old
settlers
the
aborigines
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
some
time
i
going
to
have
a
regular
aboriginal
and
all
the
shall
be
invited
we
have
a
reel
and
forfeits
and
all
sorts
of
things
and
off
to
one
side
of
the
wigwam
there
shall
be
two
or
three
beautiful
young
squaws
to
pour
firewater
will
you
be
one
of
them
well
jane
hesitated
i
not
so
very
young
you
know
nor
so
very
beautiful
either
you
are
to
me
responded
bates
with
a
caloric
brevity
nobody
shall
come
she
went
on
who
was
here
before
the
war
those
who
came
before
the
incorporation
that
was
in
was
it
shall
be
doubly
welcome
and
if
i
can
find
any
one
who
passed
through
the
massacre
as
an
infant
you
understand
he
shall
have
the
head
place
i
mean
to
ask
your
father
and
your
mother
she
added
with
a
firm
but
delicate
emphasis
i
must
call
on
her
presently
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
fireplace
i
suppose
i
was
silly
the
way
i
acted
when
your
father
married
she
went
on
carefully
we
were
only
friends
there
was
really
nothing
between
us
but
i
was
piqued
and
oh
well
you
know
how
it
is
i
cried
jane
routed
by
her
alarm
from
her
contrite
and
tearful
mood
i
not
the
least
bit
i
assure
you
she
blushed
and
gulped
and
ducked
her
head
and
half
hid
her
face
behind
her
hand
not
the
least
in
the
world
why
if
i
were
to
die
nobody
would
care
but
pa
and
ma
and
roger
and
truesdale
and
alice
well
and
rosy
yes
perhaps
rosy
would
care
for
me
if
i
was
dead
but
nobody
else
oh
dear
no
she
stared
at
bates
with
a
hard
wide
brightness
bates
considerately
shifted
her
gaze
to
the
front
of
the
bureau
she
ran
her
eye
down
one
row
of
knobs
i
wonder
who
he
is
and
up
the
other
i
hope
he
is
worthy
of
her
doubly
considerate
she
turned
her
back
too
she
began
to
rummage
among
the
drawers
of
her
old
desk
there
she
said
presently
i
knew
i
could
put
my
hands
on
it
she
set
a
daguerreotype
before
jane
its
oval
was
bordered
with
a
narrow
line
of
gilded
metal
and
its
small
square
back
was
covered
with
embossed
brown
leather
there
now
do
you
know
who
that
is
jane
looked
back
and
forth
doubtfully
between
the
picture
and
its
owner
is
it
is
it
pa
bates
nodded
jane
regarded
the
daguerreotype
with
a
puzzled
fascination
did
my
father
ever
wear
his
hair
all
wavy
across
his
forehead
that
way
and
have
such
a
thing
tied
around
his
throat
and
wear
a
vest
all
covered
with
those
little
gold
sprigs
precisely
that
just
the
way
he
looked
the
last
time
we
danced
together
and
what
do
you
suppose
the
dance
was
guess
and
guess
and
guess
again
it
was
this
bates
whisked
herself
on
to
the
and
began
to
play
and
to
sing
her
touch
was
heavy
and
spirited
but
her
voice
was
easily
audible
above
the
instrument
dan
tucker
he
got
drunk
he
jumped
in
the
fire
and
he
kicked
up
a
chunk
of
charcoal
with
his
shoe
lordy
how
the
ashes
jane
dropped
the
daguerreotype
in
time
to
take
up
the
refrain
the
road
for
old
dan
tucker
you
too
late
to
get
your
supper
clear
the
road
for
old
dan
aha
you
know
it
cried
bates
gayly
of
course
responded
jane
my
education
may
be
modern
on
the
whole
but
it
has
neglected
the
classics
completely
gentlemen
forward
she
said
with
a
sudden
cry
which
sent
bates
fingers
back
to
the
keyboard
forward
to
mister
tucker
bates
pounded
loudly
and
jane
pirouetted
up
to
her
from
behind
forward
to
mister
tucker
cried
jane
and
bates
left
the
stool
and
began
dancing
towards
her
then
she
danced
back
and
took
her
seat
again
but
with
the
first
chord
all
forward
to
mister
tucker
called
jane
again
and
they
met
face
to
face
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
burst
out
laughing
the
door
opened
on
a
narrow
crack
and
there
appeared
miss
peters
plaintive
and
inquiring
countenance
bates
banished
her
assistant
by
one
look
of
pathetic
protest
there
she
said
transferring
the
look
to
jane
you
see
how
it
always
is
when
i
am
trying
to
have
a
good
time
even
at
my
own
table
i
budge
or
crack
a
joke
with
those
two
men
behind
my
chair
i
feel
like
my
own
tombstone
lock
that
door
she
said
to
jane
i
have
a
good
time
in
spite
of
them
sit
down
i
going
to
play
the
march
for
you
she
struck
out
several
ponderous
and
vengeful
chords
why
called
jane
is
the
march
she
spread
out
her
elbows
and
stalked
up
and
down
singing
the
is
the
right
again
cried
bates
you
one
of
us
just
as
i
said
well
if
that
the
march
said
jane
it
in
an
old
book
we
used
to
have
about
the
house
years
and
years
ago
only
if
you
bring
it
up
as
an
example
of
pa
taste
he
liked
it
because
i
played
it
perhaps
said
bates
quietly
besides
why
should
you
put
it
to
those
shocking
words
it
in
that
book
she
continued
and
i
got
one
here
just
like
it
is
it
the
one
with
on
silver
moon
and
roved
the
indian
maid
bright
bright
alfarata
same
one
exactly
bring
up
another
chair
and
we
go
through
a
whole
programme
of
classics
pruggrum
i
mean
let
see
though
said
jane
looking
at
her
watch
mercy
me
where
has
the
morning
gone
it
after
eleven
supposing
it
is
after
eleven
supposing
it
was
after
a
hundred
and
eleven
you
going
to
stay
to
lunch
i
love
to
so
much
but
i
just
ca
i
got
too
many
other
scalps
to
take
so
many
thanks
for
yours
i
going
to
work
north
towards
the
monument
another
massacre
well
wednesday
then
without
fail
they
retraced
their
steps
past
the
mournful
miss
peters
and
through
the
vast
state
bedroom
on
the
stairs
bates
said
i
remember
your
aunt
rhodes
now
the
conscientious
creature
had
been
taxing
her
memory
for
an
hour
jane
felt
that
this
was
a
tribute
not
to
her
aunt
but
to
herself
yes
bates
went
on
she
a
little
plump
dark
woman
and
when
she
sits
down
she
wiggles
and
flounces
and
goes
all
in
a
heap
like
this
bates
illustrated
by
means
of
the
on
the
landing
yes
assented
jane
she
could
not
reproach
bates
for
thus
indulging
her
sense
of
humor
in
order
to
recoup
herself
for
the
tax
on
her
memory
and
when
she
goes
it
like
this
she
gathered
up
her
gown
and
sidled
down
affectedly
over
the
remaining
steps
that
it
said
jane
joining
her
in
the
hall
below
bates
opened
the
front
door
herself
you
can
take
the
cars
at
sixteenth
you
know
and
get
off
at
van
buren
oh
dear
excuse
my
our
little
reginald
two
months
old
you
know
i
have
lottie
home
for
that
lunch
of
ours
do
apologize
said
jane
i
often
use
the
same
expression
myself
why
is
there
a
baby
at
your
house
well
said
jane
rather
lamely
alice
has
got
a
little
girl
three
years
old
so
david
marshall
is
a
grandfather
but
what
is
there
extraordinary
in
that
i
one
myself
she
stood
in
the
big
porch
looking
down
the
street
at
nothing
well
now
i
going
to
she
said
half
to
herself
settles
it
she
accompanied
jane
down
the
steps
bareheaded
as
she
was
and
in
her
a
society
reporter
who
happened
to
be
passing
originated
the
rumor
that
she
had
gone
insane
my
child
use
my
name
everywhere
take
all
that
anybody
offers
jane
retraced
her
steps
to
kiss
her
she
had
not
kissed
her
own
mother
for
ten
years
vi
within
a
month
after
truesdale
marshall
return
home
the
understanding
between
himself
and
his
father
might
fairly
have
been
classified
among
the
facts
accomplished
and
it
was
brought
about
too
by
those
indefinite
courses
those
impalpable
procedures
through
which
in
actual
life
so
many
understandings
are
really
arrived
at
truesdale
therefore
never
received
word
that
his
father
wished
to
see
him
in
the
library
as
in
the
nor
did
the
two
ever
draw
their
chairs
together
in
the
middle
of
the
stage
close
to
the
footlights
and
have
it
out
as
at
the
theatre
when
truesdale
spoke
at
all
he
spoke
casually
with
more
or
less
of
implication
or
insinuation
to
his
mother
or
his
sisters
when
he
spoke
not
at
all
he
acted
and
his
actions
spoke
as
loudly
and
effectually
as
actions
are
held
commonly
to
do
his
father
therefore
learned
presently
and
with
enough
distinctness
to
serve
all
purposes
that
the
filial
back
was
no
more
ready
now
than
ever
before
to
submit
to
harness
that
rules
and
regulations
were
sure
to
be
resented
that
dates
and
duties
were
fretful
affairs
at
best
that
engagements
and
responsibilities
were
far
too
irksome
to
be
endured
and
above
all
that
anything
like
hours
would
be
most
emphatically
beyond
the
pale
of
a
moment
consideration
truesdale
professed
to
regard
himself
as
having
returned
once
more
to
the
life
of
the
frontier
and
being
thus
placed
what
could
he
be
but
a
pioneer
very
well
he
be
a
pioneer
the
pioneer
of
a
leisure
class
he
made
however
one
concession
to
his
father
he
consented
to
a
reduction
in
his
allowance
he
had
led
himself
to
believe
that
now
at
last
in
the
town
of
his
birth
the
career
of
a
man
of
leisure
was
completely
practicable
during
his
long
absence
from
home
his
family
had
sent
him
at
intervals
copies
of
the
local
newspapers
sheets
whose
utterances
were
triumphantly
optimistic
even
beyond
their
triumphant
and
optimistic
wont
furthermore
his
courses
over
the
continent
had
brought
him
into
contact
with
many
travellers
more
lately
from
home
than
himself
whose
strange
and
topping
tales
carried
indeed
in
a
direction
the
reverse
of
that
taken
by
most
such
reports
had
told
him
much
of
contemporaneous
achievement
behind
them
and
had
filled
him
with
a
that
no
expectations
founded
on
such
a
base
could
be
exorbitant
a
great
light
had
arisen
the
city
notably
a
metropolis
for
many
years
already
had
opened
out
into
a
cosmopolis
the
poet
had
at
last
arrived
and
the
earth
was
now
tolerable
for
the
foot
of
man
he
visited
on
the
south
shore
the
great
white
shell
from
which
the
spirit
had
taken
its
formal
leave
but
a
week
before
and
he
acknowledged
the
potency
of
the
poet
spell
it
good
he
assented
better
than
i
could
have
thought
better
than
anybody
over
there
could
be
made
to
believe
i
might
have
tried
to
get
home
a
fortnight
sooner
perhaps
he
met
the
universal
expectation
that
the
spirit
of
the
white
city
was
but
just
transferred
to
the
body
of
the
great
black
city
close
at
hand
over
which
it
was
to
hover
as
an
enlightenment
through
which
it
might
permeate
as
an
informing
force
good
he
thought
there
no
place
where
it
needed
more
or
where
it
might
do
more
good
the
great
town
in
fact
sprawled
and
coiled
about
him
like
a
hideous
monster
a
piteous
floundering
monster
too
it
almost
called
for
tears
nowhere
a
more
tireless
activity
nowhere
a
more
profuse
expenditure
nowhere
a
more
determined
striving
after
the
ornate
nowhere
a
more
undaunted
endeavor
towards
the
monumental
expression
of
success
yet
nowhere
a
result
so
pitifully
grotesque
grewsome
appalling
so
little
taste
sighed
truesdale
so
little
training
so
little
education
so
total
an
absence
of
any
collective
sense
of
the
fit
and
the
proper
who
could
believe
here
that
there
cities
elsewhere
which
fashioned
themselves
rightly
almost
by
intuition
which
took
shape
and
reached
harmony
by
an
unreasoned
instinct
as
you
might
say
but
let
that
pass
he
must
take
the
town
as
he
found
it
between
his
own
transplanted
artistic
interests
on
the
one
hand
and
his
association
with
the
great
throng
of
artists
that
the
had
doubtless
brought
and
held
he
should
do
well
enough
he
figured
mornings
given
over
to
music
and
painting
his
own
and
afternoons
of
when
would
turn
him
their
unfinished
canvasses
to
the
light
or
would
pull
away
the
clinging
sheets
from
their
shapes
of
dampened
clay
and
evenings
when
the
room
would
thicken
with
smoke
and
tall
glasses
would
make
rings
on
the
shining
tops
of
tables
while
a
dozen
agile
wits
had
their
own
way
with
monet
and
bourget
and
verlaine
for
the
rest
if
need
be
receptions
or
if
pushed
to
it
tea
with
the
chance
that
one
other
man
might
be
present
thus
the
winter
as
for
the
summer
no
canoeing
of
course
on
the
lahn
and
the
moselle
i
must
fall
back
upon
the
historic
illinois
with
its
immemorial
towns
and
villages
and
crumbling
cathedrals
and
the
long
line
of
ancient
and
picturesque
ch√¢teaux
between
ottawa
and
peoria
no
more
villeggiatura
at
frascati
or
fiesole
i
shall
have
to
flee
from
the
summer
heats
to
the
wild
ravines
and
gorges
of
dupage
county
and
raise
turnips
and
cabbages
there
with
the
rest
of
them
putting
aside
for
the
present
all
thought
of
the
coming
summer
truesdale
set
himself
to
the
formation
of
a
circle
he
had
gone
away
as
a
boy
and
had
come
back
as
a
young
man
he
had
grown
beyond
his
old
acquaintances
he
thought
and
apart
from
them
of
which
last
there
could
be
no
doubt
on
either
side
and
it
struck
him
that
the
easiest
and
simplest
thing
to
do
would
be
to
drop
them
all
and
to
start
afresh
to
drop
everybody
and
to
start
afresh
was
something
he
was
completely
habituated
to
he
did
it
through
the
year
at
intervals
of
from
three
to
six
months
during
the
busy
summer
season
among
the
swiss
pensions
he
had
done
it
once
every
fortnight
or
oftener
his
nature
was
full
of
adaptability
receptivity
fluidity
he
made
friends
everywhere
he
went
and
snatched
up
acquaintances
at
every
corner
among
the
first
in
his
new
batch
were
theodore
brower
and
arthur
paston
they
were
both
older
than
he
but
he
declared
that
his
compatriots
of
his
own
age
were
impossible
these
two
new
acquaintances
he
appeared
to
like
equally
well
and
jane
whose
kindling
ambition
had
devoted
her
brother
to
a
brilliant
social
career
and
whose
forenoon
with
bates
had
done
little
enough
to
quench
the
mounting
flame
wondered
how
such
an
augury
was
to
be
read
for
brower
was
wholly
out
of
society
while
paston
was
understood
to
be
save
for
some
slight
but
inevitable
business
entanglements
wholly
in
it
she
decided
finally
that
as
truesdale
had
met
brower
in
their
own
house
involuntarily
as
it
were
while
he
had
met
paston
outside
as
a
result
inferentially
of
his
own
endeavors
and
advances
the
brilliant
future
of
her
brother
was
in
no
danger
of
being
compromised
then
she
restored
the
just
balance
between
the
two
by
the
thought
that
truesdale
had
taken
very
kindly
to
theod
to
brower
after
all
much
more
so
than
rosy
whose
sauciness
she
could
think
of
no
other
word
jane
found
herself
unable
to
forgive
theodore
brower
was
some
ten
years
older
than
truesdale
his
hair
was
beginning
to
retreat
before
his
advancing
forehead
and
about
his
eyes
were
coming
to
appear
those
lines
proper
to
the
man
who
is
in
business
for
himself
and
pretty
largely
absorbed
in
it
he
had
a
pair
of
shrewd
but
kindly
brown
eyes
and
a
straightforward
and
serious
manner
he
held
his
hand
more
or
less
on
the
pulsing
actualities
of
the
town
and
at
one
time
or
another
he
took
truesdale
to
most
of
his
clubs
the
crepuscular
the
consolation
the
simplicity
the
universe
at
most
of
these
they
dined
moderately
and
discussed
immoderately
except
at
the
simplicity
whose
avowed
object
was
to
free
man
from
the
tyranny
of
things
there
they
discussed
and
did
not
dine
at
all
brower
called
at
the
marshall
house
at
discreet
intervals
now
and
then
provided
there
was
a
plausible
pretext
for
business
the
interval
was
shortened
he
looked
after
all
of
old
marshall
insurance
interests
and
the
alterations
in
the
business
premises
of
marshall
belden
seemed
to
furnish
him
with
such
a
pretext
the
various
policies
required
various
permits
from
various
companies
and
numerous
changes
to
correspond
with
the
changes
in
the
building
itself
true
brower
might
have
sent
one
of
his
young
men
to
the
store
but
he
preferred
to
come
himself
to
the
house
his
presence
there
under
this
ruse
was
attended
by
various
phenomena
it
was
then
that
jane
would
pant
over
the
banister
and
palpitate
in
doorways
and
start
and
hesitate
and
advance
and
retreat
and
presently
go
gliding
along
the
hall
and
finally
look
in
through
the
open
door
to
say
with
affected
surprise
and
disappointment
why
dear
me
it
only
brower
after
all
then
the
humiliation
which
she
joyfully
supposed
him
to
suffer
through
the
infliction
of
such
an
indignity
would
be
cancelled
by
a
talk
which
as
regarded
jane
intention
at
least
would
be
quite
gracious
and
brilliant
brower
went
through
this
ordeal
serenely
enough
and
never
hesitated
to
expose
himself
again
to
rosamund
these
subterfuges
were
too
obvious
for
comment
this
she
reserved
for
those
other
occasions
when
brower
attentions
were
not
made
to
assume
the
mask
of
business
she
objected
that
he
came
generally
in
a
that
he
sometimes
presented
himself
too
early
that
he
dispensed
with
the
mediatory
services
of
a
card
that
he
asked
at
the
door
for
miss
jane
and
that
she
herself
was
always
treated
by
him
as
a
child
does
he
know
protested
rosy
that
jane
is
marshall
and
does
he
think
that
i
shall
let
him
go
on
calling
me
by
a
mere
nickname
she
appeared
to
feel
instinctively
the
point
and
the
justness
of
these
her
various
exceptions
though
where
she
collected
her
data
it
might
have
been
difficult
definitely
to
say
she
was
served
by
intuition
perhaps
or
by
a
sixth
sense
the
social
sense
which
was
now
rapidly
developing
from
some
recess
hidden
and
hitherto
all
unsuspected
though
brower
was
out
of
society
truesdale
did
not
find
him
on
this
account
any
the
more
in
bohemia
he
merely
occupied
the
firm
and
definite
of
business
but
paston
on
the
other
hand
while
firmly
set
in
the
flowery
field
of
society
was
quite
capable
of
lifting
a
foot
now
and
then
to
put
it
within
the
borders
of
another
and
a
different
area
truesdale
first
met
him
in
a
sculptor
studio
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
great
office
buildings
the
young
briton
was
escorting
a
pair
of
young
women
of
his
own
circle
who
seemed
disposed
to
encourage
art
to
the
extent
of
seeing
how
the
thing
was
done
and
whose
interest
was
largely
exhausted
with
an
understanding
of
certain
mechanical
processes
he
and
truesdale
subsequently
grazed
against
each
other
at
places
where
young
women
again
were
present
whose
interest
in
matters
aesthetic
was
in
varying
proportions
and
whose
social
foothold
was
in
the
lower
strata
or
substrata
as
the
case
might
be
paston
handled
life
with
the
easy
freedom
of
a
man
who
after
all
was
away
from
home
and
truesdale
was
not
far
behind
home
with
him
was
everywhere
or
rather
nowhere
he
had
a
great
capacity
for
jauntings
and
an
immense
abhorrence
of
superfluous
luggage
and
among
the
most
superfluous
of
all
luggage
he
included
scruples
first
and
foremost
as
soon
expect
a
swallow
to
carry
a
portmanteau
during
his
first
year
abroad
he
had
dabbled
a
good
deal
in
french
fiction
this
was
at
geneva
before
his
long
and
intimate
sojourn
in
paris
his
taste
had
been
formed
in
the
first
instance
by
the
more
frivolous
productions
of
the
romantic
school
by
mademoiselle
de
maupin
in
part
by
the
vie
de
boheme
more
largely
and
this
taste
had
taken
a
confirmed
set
through
the
perusal
of
other
works
of
a
like
trend
more
contemporaneous
and
therefore
still
more
deleterious
at
geneva
he
had
permitted
himself
various
fond
imaginings
of
mimi
and
musette
as
they
might
disclose
themselves
in
paris
it
was
useless
all
to
expect
the
encounter
in
this
strenuous
little
stronghold
of
calvinism
but
mimi
and
musette
the
actual
the
contemporaneous
once
met
at
short
range
were
far
far
from
the
and
creations
of
murger
and
of
and
if
disappointing
in
paris
how
much
more
so
in
chicago
where
impropriety
was
still
wholly
incapable
of
presenting
itself
in
a
guise
that
could
enlist
the
sympathies
of
the
fastidious
truesdale
whether
or
no
found
himself
restricted
within
reasonable
bounds
by
his
own
good
taste
nor
was
paston
permitted
much
greater
latitude
whatever
his
taste
the
condition
of
his
finances
would
alone
have
checked
him
from
straying
too
widely
outside
the
beaten
path
paston
was
less
reticent
about
the
worldly
status
of
himself
and
his
family
than
might
have
been
expected
he
treated
the
subject
in
a
broad
free
fashion
with
a
great
pretense
to
openness
few
apprehended
the
general
and
essential
cautiousness
of
his
disclosures
most
people
fell
easily
enough
into
the
notion
that
so
much
frank
jocularity
had
no
other
object
than
to
entertain
them
the
young
man
was
doubtless
exaggerating
possibly
inventing
absurd
situation
is
it
he
would
set
forth
in
his
large
and
genial
way
poor
father
six
girls
to
see
married
off
and
five
boys
to
start
in
life
quite
as
bad
one
in
the
army
one
in
the
navy
one
in
the
church
one
in
the
civil
service
and
one
in
america
no
other
way
somebody
had
to
come
to
america
the
youngest
naturally
and
here
he
is
fancy
that
bessie
imagine
that
allie
his
hearers
would
cry
then
they
would
ask
him
about
the
in
bucks
and
tease
him
for
further
particulars
about
his
sister
edith
who
had
married
lord
the
subject
of
america
he
treated
with
some
tact
with
some
forbearance
he
himself
may
have
thought
if
asked
whether
he
liked
it
he
would
reply
that
his
preference
naturally
must
be
for
england
if
asked
further
whether
he
liked
chicago
an
inquiry
which
courtesy
might
well
have
withheld
he
would
answer
promptly
and
plainly
no
and
there
the
matter
would
end
he
never
gave
detailed
explanations
he
was
prepared
it
came
to
be
understood
to
put
the
best
face
on
a
bad
matter
he
remained
however
a
loyal
subject
of
the
queen
and
prayed
for
as
speedy
a
sight
of
boxton
park
witham
essex
as
fortune
would
permit
and
in
the
meantime
he
enjoyed
such
makeshift
pleasures
as
came
his
way
among
these
was
that
of
leaving
his
card
at
several
good
houses
the
card
of
arthur
gerald
people
met
him
at
functions
as
but
most
of
them
found
his
name
rather
a
large
mouthful
after
they
had
used
it
enough
times
to
show
that
they
had
caught
it
and
were
not
unable
to
wield
it
they
would
dispense
with
the
forepart
and
use
the
paston
alone
this
usage
received
the
approval
of
a
certain
few
who
had
had
the
privilege
of
addressing
royalty
or
subroyalty
and
who
remembered
that
after
they
had
used
the
expression
your
royal
highness
a
few
times
they
were
entitled
to
an
occasional
lapse
into
the
simpler
you
at
the
office
where
he
was
by
no
means
a
royal
highness
he
was
always
paston
and
paston
merely
his
father
was
a
general
in
the
british
army
but
lately
retired
he
never
referred
to
this
dignitary
as
such
save
twice
these
early
references
pointed
but
discreet
he
held
to
suffice
he
estimated
properly
enough
that
his
father
fame
once
started
might
be
trusted
to
spread
of
itself
and
it
did
along
with
the
son
modesty
it
was
doubtless
to
his
father
personal
influence
that
he
was
indebted
for
his
connection
with
a
great
mortgage
and
investment
company
which
extended
in
a
chain
of
many
links
all
the
way
from
london
to
colorado
and
a
foothold
in
whose
chicago
office
he
had
been
fortunate
enough
to
secure
the
salary
connected
with
the
place
was
but
yet
the
place
itself
as
agreed
to
among
the
englishry
of
chicago
was
in
no
degree
unsuited
to
a
young
man
of
good
family
fair
education
small
resources
and
limited
prospects
and
a
desire
to
make
a
decorous
and
figure
in
society
such
society
as
western
conditions
offered
they
said
the
position
was
as
good
socially
as
any
in
one
of
the
branch
canadian
banks
some
of
the
more
intensely
english
the
canadians
themselves
were
fain
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
even
better
so
paston
did
his
office
work
of
whatever
kind
during
the
day
and
distributed
his
cards
through
the
evening
hours
and
dined
out
with
a
whenever
occasion
offered
this
was
often
enough
he
soon
became
known
as
one
of
the
most
persistent
in
town
and
one
of
the
most
accomplished
his
animal
spirits
were
overflowing
his
plump
and
ruddy
person
seemed
to
be
at
once
grace
appetizer
and
benediction
his
fund
of
stories
and
anecdotes
constantly
replenished
from
the
most
approved
sources
was
inexhaustible
he
carried
everything
through
almost
by
reason
of
his
abounding
vitality
and
everybody
wanted
him
who
could
get
him
his
presence
lessened
by
half
the
rigors
of
entertaining
he
therefore
lodged
quietly
in
a
retired
little
house
in
the
edge
of
a
good
neighborhood
they
gave
him
his
breakfast
there
and
warded
off
those
who
came
to
spy
out
the
leanness
of
the
land
he
was
thus
seldom
called
upon
to
take
thought
for
the
morrow
having
once
passed
that
is
to
say
the
crucial
hour
of
lunch
he
led
germans
and
promoted
other
social
industries
his
vacations
he
could
have
spent
six
times
over
at
all
manner
of
desirable
places
on
sundays
through
the
summer
he
was
possessed
briefly
of
the
freedom
of
the
scattered
suburban
settlements
along
the
north
shore
he
always
got
a
hundred
cents
out
of
every
dollar
and
in
many
instances
he
got
the
hundred
cents
and
kept
the
dollar
too
truesdale
was
slow
in
making
up
his
mind
to
introduce
paston
into
his
own
household
but
paston
presently
made
his
entr√©e
there
under
other
auspices
and
within
a
month
from
that
day
rosamund
marshall
was
studying
debrett
and
was
taking
hurdles
at
a
for
a
third
new
acquaintance
truesdale
was
indebted
to
his
aunt
lydia
he
had
felt
certain
all
along
that
some
such
indebtedness
would
befall
his
aunt
lived
two
or
three
miles
due
south
from
his
father
near
the
last
brace
of
big
hotels
her
house
had
a
rather
imposing
but
impassive
front
of
with
many
neighbors
more
or
less
varying
the
same
type
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
over
the
way
the
house
had
never
the
absolute
effect
of
extending
hospitality
but
he
understood
the
possibilities
of
the
interior
and
knew
that
a
cup
of
tea
late
on
a
november
afternoon
was
among
them
as
he
drew
near
he
found
this
house
and
the
other
houses
combined
in
a
conspiracy
of
silence
against
the
musical
addresses
of
a
swarthy
foreigner
who
had
a
foothold
a
yard
beyond
the
curbstone
and
who
was
turning
the
crank
of
his
instrument
with
all
the
rapid
regularity
of
the
thorough
mechanician
the
whole
street
rang
perch√®
non
posso
odiarti
hummed
truesdale
in
unison
with
the
organ
as
the
performer
after
an
intricate
cadenza
returned
to
the
original
theme
that
the
only
recognizable
thing
i
heard
these
fellows
play
since
i
came
over
i
wonder
who
puts
together
all
the
shocking
stuff
they
are
loaded
up
with
nowadays
the
melody
so
plaintive
and
cloying
as
a
vocal
performance
leaped
forward
briskly
enough
under
the
rapid
lashings
to
and
fro
of
the
crank
the
elbow
of
the
organist
moved
with
a
swift
rhythm
as
his
searching
eye
tried
vainly
to
wring
a
penny
or
two
from
some
one
of
all
these
opulent
facades
good
heaven
cried
truesdale
how
little
feeling
how
little
expression
here
he
said
to
the
man
in
italian
take
this
half
lira
and
let
have
a
chance
bellini
was
never
meant
to
go
like
that
the
man
with
a
cheerful
grin
yielded
up
his
instrument
to
this
engaging
youth
who
was
able
to
address
him
so
pointedly
in
his
own
language
and
truesdale
with
his
eye
on
his
aunt
upper
windows
proceeded
to
indulge
himself
in
a
realization
of
his
ideal
his
aunt
was
vastly
susceptible
to
music
and
he
would
heap
upon
her
in
the
absence
of
any
other
all
those
passionate
reproaches
for
cruelty
and
faithlessness
proper
to
the
r√¥le
welling
crescendos
and
plaintive
diminuendos
and
long
slow
rallentandos
followed
quickly
by
panting
and
impassioned
accelerandos
in
other
words
he
would
show
this
the
possibilities
of
his
instrument
and
the
emotional
capacity
of
the
human
soul
incidentally
he
should
earn
his
cup
of
tea
why
oh
why
do
i
strive
in
vain
to
thee
cruel
creature
as
deeply
as
i
would
began
truesdale
blithely
with
his
eye
on
the
one
window
whose
shade
was
not
completely
lowered
but
at
the
third
or
fourth
measure
he
paused
disconcerted
he
had
adopted
a
varying
rhythm
to
express
each
last
fine
shade
of
the
text
and
the
air
was
already
littered
with
abrupt
and
disjointed
phrases
which
began
with
a
quick
snarl
or
with
a
prolonged
nasal
wail
leaving
a
sudden
hiatus
here
and
giving
there
a
long
lingering
scream
on
some
mere
passing
note
dear
me
exclaimed
truesdale
this
wo
do
at
all
here
signor
organista
just
set
that
thing
back
will
you
and
we
start
again
why
oh
why
do
i
strive
in
vain
to
hate
thee
more
notes
shattered
themselves
on
the
stone
walls
about
him
singly
in
bunches
in
long
detached
wails
the
organ
yelped
and
snarled
as
truesdale
time
routed
and
accent
annihilated
abandoned
himself
to
the
expression
and
the
phrasing
of
the
true
italian
school
two
or
three
passing
children
paused
on
the
pavement
a
park
policeman
stationed
on
the
next
corner
walked
his
sedate
slowly
along
to
the
point
of
disturbance
presently
the
object
of
all
this
attention
showed
herself
rhodes
appeared
at
the
window
with
that
expression
of
indignant
protest
which
forecasts
an
appeal
to
the
authorities
when
she
saw
the
offending
cause
her
indignation
did
not
greatly
diminish
she
refused
to
smile
even
when
truesdale
extended
his
hat
for
the
usual
tribute
he
saw
her
lips
move
however
with
a
quick
exclamation
which
brought
a
second
person
to
the
window
then
both
immediately
withdrew
another
niece
i
swear
said
truesdale
and
i
walked
right
into
it
he
gave
the
man
a
second
dime
i
guess
you
understand
it
better
than
i
do
after
all
he
said
magnanimously
what
was
your
idea
in
making
me
ridiculous
that
way
his
aunt
asked
in
severe
reproach
as
she
advanced
to
meet
him
in
the
do
you
want
to
set
me
up
as
a
laughingstock
for
all
my
friends
and
neighbors
after
all
i
told
bertie
about
your
music
too
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
let
you
know
her
or
not
it
was
pretty
rocky
was
it
truesdale
admitted
with
a
cheery
impartiality
i
afraid
it
takes
more
practice
than
i
ever
had
a
chance
to
give
it
and
perhaps
i
do
understand
the
genius
of
the
instrument
where
do
you
suppose
they
learn
to
do
it
how
long
a
course
is
necessary
do
you
fancy
to
get
a
complete
grip
on
the
technique
his
aunt
protest
had
been
purely
personal
with
a
broader
outlook
and
a
better
understanding
she
might
have
protested
on
behalf
of
a
slighted
neighborhood
or
indeed
of
a
misprized
town
a
finer
vision
might
have
seen
in
truesdale
prank
a
indifference
alike
to
place
and
people
i
do
know
the
warners
over
the
way
will
think
she
emitted
as
if
that
were
all
she
presently
relented
as
to
the
new
inmate
of
her
household
come
bertie
she
called
step
up
like
a
good
girl
this
is
my
nephew
truesdale
you
heard
all
about
him
miss
bertie
patterson
of
madison
miss
patterson
of
madison
was
a
shy
little
girl
who
at
a
guess
had
been
in
long
dresses
but
a
year
or
two
as
she
faced
truesdale
she
seemed
to
be
wondering
if
she
might
venture
to
smile
she
had
never
before
been
south
of
the
wisconsin
state
line
but
rhodes
having
exhausted
the
ranks
of
her
own
nieces
was
now
giving
a
tardy
recognition
to
the
nieces
of
her
late
husband
bertie
patterson
had
come
for
the
winter
and
she
was
finding
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
interest
slightly
tinctured
with
awe
in
a
town
which
for
some
years
she
had
favored
with
a
highly
idealistic
anticipation
nice
little
thing
admitted
truesdale
inwardly
but
aunt
lydia
has
got
to
leave
alone
rhodes
took
him
into
the
and
had
bertie
patterson
make
him
his
tea
she
did
this
very
nicely
she
helped
rather
than
hindered
the
effect
by
her
hesitancy
and
lack
of
complete
confidence
she
had
never
poured
tea
many
times
before
for
a
young
man
never
at
all
for
just
such
a
young
man
as
this
now
said
his
aunt
presently
she
emitted
this
monosyllable
with
a
falling
inflection
and
followed
it
by
a
full
stop
she
took
his
teacup
from
him
you
know
what
little
tommy
tucker
did
she
placed
her
thumb
on
one
of
the
upper
black
notes
of
the
piano
and
waved
her
fingers
over
the
remainder
of
the
keyboard
a
song
at
twilight
she
quoted
with
a
coaxing
smile
all
right
said
truesdale
promptly
thanks
for
this
chance
to
redeem
myself
i
show
you
now
how
it
really
ought
to
go
and
he
did
at
milan
he
had
seen
reflected
in
his
not
only
fernando
but
elvino
too
besides
edgardo
and
manrico
and
that
whole
romantic
brotherhood
he
resuscitated
them
all
with
as
much
sentiment
romance
passion
drama
as
each
individual
case
required
while
bertie
patterson
sat
in
the
fading
light
behind
the
great
screen
of
the
cover
and
clasped
her
hands
and
brought
her
generous
idealizing
faculty
into
its
fullest
play
then
he
sang
a
few
german
lieder
of
a
more
contemporaneous
cast
then
his
aunt
asked
him
for
that
last
sweet
little
thing
of
his
own
i
believe
bertie
has
ever
heard
a
composer
sing
one
of
his
own
songs
as
he
concluded
his
aunt
gave
a
long
and
appreciative
sigh
there
she
breathed
then
why
do
you
act
like
a
crazy
when
you
can
be
so
nice
if
you
only
will
vii
drive
on
a
little
farther
martin
bates
directed
her
coachman
i
can
never
work
my
way
through
all
that
mess
beds
of
mortar
and
piles
of
brick
half
filled
the
roadway
and
the
posts
of
a
kind
of
rough
plank
canopy
which
formed
a
shelter
for
pedestrians
rose
flush
with
the
curbstone
far
above
this
improvised
shelter
bricklayers
were
adding
the
courses
of
a
new
story
or
two
to
the
walls
of
a
shabby
and
old
structure
and
immediately
below
it
the
march
of
traffic
and
the
hubbub
of
trade
proceeded
upon
the
broad
flag
sidewalk
as
fully
as
contractors
and
their
underlings
would
permit
right
over
there
bates
indicated
between
that
and
the
row
of
porters
in
blue
overalls
hurried
boxes
and
tubs
across
the
wide
walk
to
the
waiting
carts
of
suburban
grocers
through
the
dingy
windows
there
showed
rows
of
shelves
set
with
bottles
of
olives
or
cluttered
with
glass
jars
containing
various
grades
of
molasses
from
the
narrow
window
of
a
small
close
pen
a
few
feet
within
the
door
a
wearing
a
battered
straw
hat
of
the
past
summer
thrust
out
bills
of
lading
to
draymen
and
issued
directions
to

gang
of
german
and
swedish
roustabouts
i
have
taken
a
great
time
to
come
bates
observed
to
herself
she
rubbed
a
streak
of
lime
from
her
fur
coat
and
stooped
to
pick
a
splinter
from
the
hem
of
her
skirt
who
the
one
to
ask
i
wonder
she
secured
the
interest
of
a
plump
young
german
whose
viscous
hands
had
just
left
a
and
whose
wide
blue
eyes
stared
at
this
unaccustomed
visitor
with
an
honest
wonder
he
ventured
to
lead
her
as
far
as
a
door
in
a
grimy
glass
partition
which
closed
off
a
large
room
filled
with
desks
clerks
and
circles
of
teacups
stood
on
the
round
tops
of
oak
tables
little
pasteboard
trays
of
coffee
were
disposed
on
the
wide
and
were
also
ranged
on
the
top
of
a
substantial
balustrade
that
shut
off
two
or
three
gentlemen
in
high
silk
hats
from
the
other
occupants
of
the
place
bates
threw
herself
upon
the
guidance
of
a
young
the
sole
person
present
who
seemed
sufficiently
disengaged
to
notice
her
he
asked
her
with
a
mixture
of
surprise
and
deference
what
name
he
should
give
sue
lathrop
say
she
responded
in
an
access
of
large
and
liberal
recklessness
she
was
led
through
another
door
in
another
dingy
glass
partition
to
a
smaller
room
at
one
corner
and
as
she
passed
along
she
threw
a
general
glance
over
her
surroundings
so
here
then
she
said
under
her
breath
as
one
of
the
gentlemen
took
off
his
hat
and
set
it
carefully
on
top
of
a
desk
i
forgotten
all
about
his
being
in
business
with
david
it
just
as
well
if
he
did
see
me
no
love
lost
she
added
grimly
she
paused
on
the
threshold
of
this
last
doorway
apparently
she
had
fallen
upon
the
final
moments
of
some
small
conference
a
tall
spare
old
man
was
delaying
the
resumption
of
his
correspondence
to
call
a
last
word
after
a
younger
one
who
had
just
set
his
hat
upon
the
back
of
his
head
and
was
now
moving
towards
the
exit
try
a
summons
yes
said
the
elder
that
would
have
been
the
best
thing
to
start
with
would
it
i
do
quite
see
it
that
way
replied
the
other
in
the
tone
of
heated
defence
he
took
the
goods
and
must
have
had
them
on
the
premises
you
did
find
them
though
i
do
quite
see
the
use
of
your
having
gone
with
a
writ
of
replevin
after
goods
that
i
were
bought
to
be
sold
again
as
soon
as
might
be
such
old
stuff
is
worked
off
in
any
such
haste
as
that
it
as
i
tell
you
word
was
got
around
to
her
that
the
writ
had
been
issued
the
place
was
all
turned
upside
down
the
things
had
been
hidden
away
who
could
have
told
her
who
cried
the
other
with
a
scornful
impatience
somebody
connected
with
the
court
who
else
could
who
else
knew
well
i
try
the
other
thing
there
is
plenty
yet
to
be
learned
about
justice
no
doubt
he
passed
out
with
snapping
eyes
and
a
curl
on
his
lips
and
the
older
man
again
bent
himself
over
his
desk
it
was
a
cramped
little
room
with
a
breadth
or
two
of
worn
oilcloth
on
the
floor
two
or
three
shelves
set
across
the
dingy
window
supported
a
range
of
glass
jars
filled
with
nutmegs
and
on
the
tilted
flagging
outside
the
tops
of
a
row
of
blue
gasoline
barrels
held
each
a
of
the
past
night
shower
and
across
the
muddy
street
bunches
of
battered
bananas
hung
from
the
rusty
framework
of
several
shabby
old
awnings
poor
david
twenty
years
and
more
of
bates
stood
within
the
doorway
it
was
easy
enough
to
figure
her
as
already
forgotten
easier
still
when
the
old
man
start
at
length
acknowledged
her
presence
she
stepped
forward
with
an
undaunted
cordiality
well
david
here
i
am
at
last
you
see
the
mountain
would
come
to
mohammed
so
she
tapped
her
foot
smartly
on
the
oilcloth
here
stands
sue
lathrop
with
a
long
memory
and
a
disposition
to
meet
the
mountain
or
or
or
to
trudge
the
whole
distance
even
to
the
last
yard
one
two
three
she
counted
as
she
stepped
up
to
his
desk
and
flung
out
her
hand
the
old
man
rose
with
something
like
alacrity
he
banished
his
slight
frown
of
preoccupation
and
hastened
to
replace
it
by
an
expression
of
so
to
speak
apologetic
cordiality
bates
he
murmured
it
very
kind
of
you
to
come
here
very
my
daughter
he
hesitated
he
finished
the
sentence
by
drawing
up
a
chair
and
clearing
its
seat
of
the
ruck
of
morning
papers
i
take
the
chair
she
said
as
if
in
burlesque
assumption
of
the
guidance
of
some
public
meeting
but
not
as
any
bates
you
know
david
that
i
have
come
here
to
be
treated
with
any
such
formality
as
that
he
looked
at
her
with
a
wistfulness
as
if
he
would
be
glad
enough
to
take
her
tone
were
the
thing
only
possible
but
for
such
a
juncture
as
this
he
had
little
initiative
and
less
momentum
and
he
realized
it
all
too
well
bates
seated
herself
and
threw
open
her
furs
her
affluence
her
expansiveness
her
easy
mastery
of
the
situation
seemed
to
crowd
this
square
and
ineffective
old
man
quite
into
a
corner
she
counted
his
wrinkles
and
his
gray
hairs
she
noted
the
patient
dulness
of
his
eye
and
the
slow
deliberation
of
his
movements
he
old
she
thought
older
than
i
should
have
imagined
i
might
have
bestirred
myself
and
come
before
she
turned
on
him
with
a
flash
of
her
own
magnificent
and
abounding
vitality
i
want
you
to
assure
me
that
i
am
not
in
the
way
that
i
am
not
interrupting
business
this
is
not
the
day
i
hope
that
the
little
placards
in
the
offices
tell
about
she
must
meet
his
unreadiness
with
the
fluency
over
which
she
had
such
a
fortunate
and
unfailing
command
this
is
the
busy
hour
of
the
day
nor
the
busy
day
of
the
week
nor
the
busy
week
of
the
year
marshall
smiled
slowly
he
felt
himself
coming
to
a
better
adjustment
with
her
mature
and
massive
comeliness
her
rich
and
elaborate
attire
her
and
friendly
fluency
we
are
always
busy
and
are
expecting
to
be
busier
still
but
we
are
never
too
busy
for
a
call
like
this
he
considered
that
that
was
doing
pretty
fairly
for
an
old
man
who
was
immersed
in
affairs
and
altogether
alien
to
the
amenities
of
the
great
world
bates
rubbed
again
at
the
on
her
fur
expecting
to
be
busier
yes
and
preparing
for
it
accordingly
but
why
we
she
was
not
calling
on
the
firm
i
sure
i
broke
in
on
something
at
the
very
start
she
made
him
a
determined
tender
of
this
handle
something
or
other
apparently
he
must
be
offered
to
take
hold
of
only
a
little
matter
with
my
son
it
was
ending
as
you
came
in
your
son
here
was
an
opening
indeed
not
the
one
just
home
from
abroad
oh
no
that
truesdale
roger
now
has
stayed
at
home
and
he
has
done
the
better
for
it
i
think
he
looks
after
my
law
business
he
has
never
had
any
of
the
disadvantages
of
european
travel
the
old
man
concluded
with
a
kind
of
gentle
grimness
bates
eyes
flashed
here
to
her
thinking
was
a
glimmer
of
the
real
david
after
all
my
boys
have
been
over
either
she
responded
she
cast
aside
any
lingering
fear
that
no
talk
could
ensue
it
must
it
should
no
she
went
on
neither
one
of
them
and
i
none
too
sure
that
they
ever
go
but
as
for
college
well
i
absolutely
insisted
upon
when
my
first
boy
was
getting
along
to
that
age
the
question
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
bates
had
his
views
and
i
had
mine
granger
was
for
clapping
him
right
into
business
for
a
week
i
was
positively
alarmed
up
to
that
time
my
husband
and
i
had
staved
forward
abreast
neither
had
ever
disappointed
the
other
nor
lagged
behind
the
other
but
i
was
afraid
that
the
point
had
been
reached
at
last
where
i
must
drop
him
behind
and
go
ahead
alone
dear
husband
i
began
and
when
i
begin
like
that
he
knows
i
mean
business
dear
husband
do
you
realize
what
the
next
twenty
years
are
holding
for
this
town
do
you
know
the
promise
they
have
for
a
young
man
of
family
who
is
properly
qualified
and
started
do
we
want
our
boys
to
get
their
manners
from
the
daily
hustle
of
la
salle
street
do
we
want
them
to
get
their
physique
by
doubling
over
books
all
day
in
a
close
unwholesome
office
what
the
good
of
all
our
millions
if
we
ca
start
our
children
in
life
with
good
health
and
good
manners
let
them
build
up
sound
bodies
and
let
them
learn
the
usages
of
good
society
how
to
associate
on
equal
terms
in
fact
with
men
of
their
own
class
give
them
a
chance
at
tennis
and
baseball
as
for
their
latin
and
greek
it
wo
do
them
any
real
harm
they
forget
it
all
in
due
season
and
so
forth
and
so
forth
added
bates
conscious
of
the
growing
length
of
her
tirade
well
i
had
my
way
in
the
end
i
usually
do
besides
the
satisfaction
of
finding
that
granger
bates
was
still
capable
of
stepping
right
along
with
his
wife
billy
came
home
a
big
handsome
gentlemanly
fellow
and
was
put
into
the
business
on
the
very
day
he
was
he
doing
well
and
jimmy
will
follow
in
due
course
your
oldest
boy
is
a
lawyer
then
what
the
other
one
he
a
gentleman
so
far
answered
marshall
rather
ruefully
afraid
he
almost
too
clever
to
be
anything
else
h
pondered
bates
with
a
sympathetic
thoughtfulness
bad
bad
i
sooner
have
a
boy
of
mine
dead
than
a
mere
gentleman
and
i
should
want
him
too
clever
either
my
billy
before
we
sent
him
off
to
college
showed
signs
of
cleverness
it
worried
me
a
good
deal
he
wanted
to
write
and
there
was
one
time
when
he
thought
he
wanted
to
paint
of
course
we
could
allow
anything
like
that
i
was
willing
enough
that
he
should
be
posted
on
the
best
books
and
be
able
to
tell
a
good
painting
from
a
bad
one
to
be
a
patron
of
the
arts
if
so
minded
but
to
do
things
of
that
sort
himself
oh
really
you
know
that
was
altogether
out
of
the
question
he
with
his
father
now
as
i
say
and
he
where
he
belongs
how
old
is
your
other
boy
roger
thirty
he
went
right
from
the
high
school
to
the
law
school
no
college
no
europe
yet
for
all
that
for
all
that
he
doing
well
eh
he
got
quite
a
practice
has
he
he
a
smart
fellow
he
a
good
lawyer
marshall
hesitated
a
week
previous
his
affirmative
would
have
come
more
promptly
yes
he
said
at
length
roger
is
pretty
good
in
his
line
he
does
for
himself
he
never
makes
any
demands
on
his
father
he
is
practising
right
along
and
and
learning
he
does
quite
well
in
some
things
the
old
gentleman
tone
and
manner
expressed
a
delicate
and
disappointed
qualification
and
his
thought
seemed
gliding
away
to
something
in
no
wise
connected
with
the
present
talk
bates
brought
him
back
to
the
actualities
of
the
moment
she
had
no
idea
of
permitting
her
impromptu
address
on
education
furthest
of
all
things
from
her
thoughts
as
she
had
entered
to
be
succeeded
by
an
absolute
hiatus
she
therefore
made
inquiries
of
the
customary
civility
about
the
other
members
of
the
marshall
family
she
asked
with
a
firm
and
ceremonial
emphasis
after
marshall
and
expressed
herself
as
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
renewed
relations
between
the
two
families
we
are
the
old
settlers
you
know
there
are
only
a
few
of
us
left
and
we
ought
to
hang
together
she
inquired
further
about
his
youngest
daughter
whose
social
fortunes
she
seemed
disposed
to
promote
she
even
made
a
civil
reference
to
the
remote
dweller
at
riverdale
park
and
then
with
every
appearance
of
relish
she
approached
the
subject
of
the
other
daughter
who
came
between
the
girl
who
gave
me
an
art
course
in
my
own
house
she
declared
with
twinkling
eyes
marshall
smiled
that
jane
true
enough
she
has
always
been
kind
of
literary
and
artistic
and
lately
she
has
become
architectural
too
she
is
down
here
once
or
twice
a
week
to
help
bingham
put
on
these
extra
stories
bingham
my
bingham
tom
bingham
he
the
one
who
built
our
house
she
explained
that
the
one
jane
held
out
at
first
for
an
architect
and
a
design
she
had
an
idea
that
here
was
the
chance
finally
to
make
this
old
block
an
ornament
to
the
city
but
i
thought
differently
so
i
had
people
take
off
the
cornice
and
run
up
two
stories
like
the
others
they
put
the
cornice
back
again
and
we
shall
be
under
cover
before
the
snow
flies
well
between
jane
and
tom
bingham
you
in
pretty
good
hands
have
you
had
him
before
for
anything
he
a
grand
fellow
it
do
you
lots
of
good
to
know
him
as
much
good
as
it
has
done
me
to
know
your
girl
david
she
went
on
with
a
little
touch
of
solemnity
she
a
fine
girl
she
a
splendid
girl
and
she
thinks
everything
of
her
father
so
she
does
admitted
the
old
gentleman
with
a
guarded
smile
his
comments
on
his
daughter
affection
for
him
were
never
profuse
when
she
came
to
see
me
the
other
day
bates
continued
it
was
like
a
whiff
of
air
from
the
old
times
it
was
like
one
of
the
old
settler
receptions
that
the
calumet
people
used
to
give
only
better
why
did
they
stop
them
i
wonder
are
the
old
settlers
giving
out
or
has
the
town
become
too
proud
and
indifferent
or
what
i
afraid
it
the
fault
of
the
old
settlers
themselves
responded
marshall
with
a
grave
and
quiet
smile
they
wo
stay
to
be
received
yes
i
know
said
bates
with
a
soft
little
sigh
they
are
dropping
off
one
by
one
david
she
exclaimed
suddenly
leaning
forward
with
a
wistful
smile
we
ought
never
to
have
drifted
apart
as
we
did
we
ought
not
to
have
lost
sight
of
each
other
for
all
these
years
sure
in
earnest
questioning
that
we
remember
enough
about
the
old
times
to
care
to
see
each
other
once
in
a
while
still
marshall
dropped
his
eyes
to
his
desk
and
his
long
lean
fingers
picked
out
the
border
of
its
blue
baize
covering
he
was
half
touched
half
embarrassed
i
hope
so
he
said
what
gay
times
we
used
to
have
she
went
on
still
determined
despite
his
meagre
response
upon
an
evocation
of
their
youthful
past
such
dances
and
and
everything
you
were
ever
so
good
to
me
in
those
old
days
i
have
forgotten
how
you
took
me
to
the
diorama
and
the
and
what
all
besides
and
tom
cabin
too
sure
i
should
never
have
seen
it
but
for
you
certainly
i
have
had
much
disposition
to
see
it
of
years
especially
since
they
have
put
the
in
and
there
was
topsy
and
eva
too
oh
dear
i
believe
i
should
like
to
see
it
again
after
all
do
they
give
it
over
on
the
west
side
now
and
then
you
must
remember
how
they
wore
those
tall
pointed
hats
and
those
red
petticoats
and
those
black
velvet
bands
across
themselves
in
front
not
the
and
how
they
had
the
bells
on
different
little
tables
according
to
their
size
not
topsy
and
eva
talking
about
the
peake
family
you
understand
and
there
was
adelina
patti
too
a
mere
slip
of
a
girl
in
the
quaintest
little
old
clothes
i
go
every
time
she
comes
i
would
miss
one
of
her
farewells
for
anything
you
go
too
i
suppose
the
same
old
sue
he
said
smiling
i
no
i
have
seen
her
since
that
first
time
so
long
ago
yes
she
cried
i
the
same
old
sue
and
i
always
shall
be
to
the
friends
of
those
dear
old
days
but
you
david
how
is
it
with
you
yourself
she
looked
at
him
closely
earnestly
studiously
he
felt
that
she
was
disappointed
in
him
and
he
felt
almost
disappointed
in
himself
she
had
come
to
him
extending
as
it
were
an
olive
branch
living
lustrous
and
in
return
he
seemed
able
to
offer
nothing
beyond
a
mere
twig
dry
sapless
unpliant
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
not
all
she
had
expected
to
find
him
nor
all
that
she
was
entitled
to
expect
to
find
him
he
was
even
conscious
but
more
dimly
that
he
was
not
quite
all
that
he
had
meant
to
be
no
nor
all
that
in
her
eyes
he
should
have
liked
to
be
yet
in
the
end
he
was
a
successful
man
and
she
must
know
it
true
he
had
not
rolled
up
any
such
enormous
fortune
as
that
of
granger
bates
nor
did
he
make
in
the
public
eye
any
such
splendid
and
enviable
figure
all
the
same
however
he
could
command
the
world
to
the
extent
of
three
million
dollars
nor
was
he
displeased
that
his
caller
should
have
come
at
a
time
when
indications
of
future
prosperity
greater
still
were
so
patent
all
over
the
premises
bates
smoothed
her
gloves
upon
each
other
and
cast
her
eye
over
the
nutmegs
and
and
the
other
furnishings
of
the
apartment
and
heaved
a
little
sigh
and
rose
to
go
i
am
glad
to
have
had
these
few
minutes
with
you
david
but
i
feel
that
i
have
no
right
to
take
up
any
more
of
them
i
am
sure
this
your
busy
day
after
all
she
looked
up
into
his
face
which
was
coming
once
more
to
be
overcast
with
its
accustomed
aspect
of
preoccupation
and
gave
him
her
hand
he
took
it
kindly
enough
and
she
bestowed
on
his
a
quiet
little
pressure
it
was
hardly
cordial
it
was
far
indeed
from
effusive
yet
she
had
hoped
half
an
hour
before
to
have
it
both
ten
years
ago
she
said
i
might
have
satisfied
myself
about
you
without
coming
here
at
all
she
stood
at
the
end
of
his
desk
and
stirred
with
an
unconscious
finger
the
loose
memoranda
in
a
wire
basket
on
the
corner
of
it
the
papers
used
to
speak
of
you
and
now
and
then
something
would
come
by
word
of
mouth
but
i
am
hearing
less
about
you
of
late
hold
your
own
david
do
let
the
world
forget
you
you
have
done
well
as
i
know
and
you
are
entitled
to
your
place
in
the
public
eye
she
looked
him
in
the
face
smilingly
but
very
earnestly
i
had
great
hopes
for
you
in
the
early
days
and
i
find
that
i
am
jealous
for
you
even
yet
you
have
made
a
good
deal
of
money
they
tell
me
and
you
are
getting
ready
to
make
a
good
deal
more
i
see
for
myself
but
does
it
seem
to
you
she
proceeded
carefully
that
things
are
beginning
to
be
different
that
the
man
who
enjoys
the
best
position
and
the
most
consideration
is
not
the
man
who
is
making
money
but
the
man
who
is
giving
it
away
not
the
man
who
is
benefiting
himself
but
the
man
who
is
benefiting
the
community
is
an
art
to
cultivate
david
the
art
of
giving
give
liberally
and
rightly
and
nothing
can
bring
you
more
credit
marshall
regarded
her
with
a
dubious
smile
nobody
had
ever
before
attempted
to
fit
his
head
to
such
a
cap
as
this
as
i
have
said
so
many
times
to
bates
it
something
that
people
can
imagine
a
man
disposed
to
devote
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
the
public
and
giving
it
to
help
pay
off
the
municipal
debt
how
many
people
would
consider
themselves
benefited
by
the
gift
or
would
care
a
cent
for
the
name
of
the
giver
or
fancy
his
giving
it
to
clean
up
the
streets
of
the
city
the
whole
affair
would
be
forgotten
with
the
coming
of
the
next
said
i
to
granger
it
must
be
something
solid
and
something
permanent
it
must
be
a
building
and
it
to
be
a
building
you
drive
out
with
me
to
the
university
campus
this
time
next
year
david
and
you
see
bates
hall
four
stories
high
with
dormers
and
gables
and
things
and
the
name
carved
in
over
the
doorway
to
stay
there
for
the
next
century
or
two
i
think
i
shall
name
it
susan
lathrop
bates
hall
granger
is
willing
and
make
it
a
girls
dormitory
they
call
the
girls
i
dare
say
but
i
mind
and
i
do
suppose
they
will
either
besides
boys
would
be
sure
to
be
called
so
the
difference
she
smiled
whimsically
and
made
a
feint
to
depart
but
there
are
plenty
of
other
things
she
paused
to
impart
people
are
always
running
to
us
about
schools
and
hospitals
a
few
loose
thousands
for
example
would
help
the
orchestra
guarantee
granger
has
contributed
there
too
and
lately
he
has
been
approached
about
an
endowed
theater
there
are
plenty
of
ways
your
husband
is
fond
of
music
oh
well
he
does
object
to
it
he
can
sit
out
an
evening
in
our
box
very
comfortably
but
a
man
of
his
position
is
naturally
expected
to
support
a
great
artistic
enterprise
besides
granger
thinks
a
good
deal
of
the
reputation
of
the
city
yes
there
are
plenty
of
ways
as
you
say
the
old
man
rejoined
with
his
preoccupied
smile
the
page
of
our
ledger
shows
that
no
man
in
business
is
allowed
to
forget
his
obligations
to
the
i
am
just
beginning
to
become
acquainted
with
the
public
our
public
a
is
a
good
place
for
us
to
learn
what
it
is
and
who
compose
it
and
what
their
attitude
is
toward
us
the
public
that
we
are
expected
to
do
so
much
for
bates
with
her
hand
on
the
felt
herself
obliged
to
decline
this
theme
so
tardily
introduced
though
the
old
man
tart
tone
promised
great
possibilities
she
would
have
thanked
david
marshall
for
a
prompter
contribution
of
conversational
material
she
felt
that
her
own
efforts
during
this
interview
had
been
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
she
made
no
response
and
he
stepped
forward
to
conduct
her
through
the
outer
office
to
her
carriage
you
need
go
through
all
those
porters
again
he
said
just
inside
the
outer
doorway
stood
two
gentlemen
their
faces
were
turned
towards
the
street
as
they
watched
the
preparations
for
the
upward
trip
of
a
great
length
of
metallic
cornice
why
said
bates
as
one
of
them
turned
half
round
is
that
tom
bingham
now
yes
said
marshall
he
looks
in
occasionally
how
do
you
do
mr
bingham
she
said
hastening
up
to
him
with
a
jocular
cast
in
her
eye
she
knew
the
bingham
construction
company
as
the
builders
of
a
score
of
handsome
residences
and
of
as
many
of
the
vast
structures
which
towered
all
over
the
business
district
it
seemed
droll
to
her
to
find
him
here
giving
personal
heed
to
mere
alterations
and
repairs
what
will
be
the
next
thing
let
me
send
you
a
box
of
them
i
beg
of
you
bingham
turned
round
altogether
a
tall
stalwart
man
whose
face
was
full
of
the
serenity
that
comes
from
breadth
and
poise
but
whose
mind
as
she
herself
knew
well
enough
was
too
habituated
to
the
broad
treatment
of
big
matters
to
have
any
aptitude
for
repartee
and
chatter
she
liked
to
disconcert
him
and
it
was
usually
an
easy
thing
to
do
and
i
wish
while
you
have
your
hand
in
you
would
just
come
up
and
nail
some
on
my
windows
bingham
smiled
slightly
send
on
your
blocks
he
said
if
you
think
they
will
help
me
any
he
pointed
towards
the
cornices
of
the
building
opposite
above
their
broken
skyline
a
tall
steel
frame
on
the
next
street
behind
rose
some
two
hundred
feet
into
the
air
along
the
black
lines
which
its
upper
stage
etched
against
the
sky
a
dozen
men
swarmed
in
spidery
activity
and
sent
down
the
sharp
clang
of
metal
on
metal
to
the
noisier
world
below
mine
too
he
said
shortly
as
if
the
vast
monument
were
its
own
sufficient
spokesman
he
seemed
proud
of
himself
and
of
the
town
where
such
things
could
be
accomplished
bates
flashed
forth
a
look
full
of
admiration
for
both
man
and
work
i
take
that
all
back
about
the
but
if
you
bring
up
your
kit
morning
and
make
us
an
extra
in
the
proud
for
that
too
well
then
just
come
up
to
dinner
evening
only
the
family
and
bring
your
sister
if
she
accept
on
such
short
notice
the
other
gentleman
whom
bates
had
overlooked
and
indeed
forgotten
turned
round
you
know
belden
mrs
bates
was
marshall
introduction
belden
was
a
man
between
and
fifty
his
costume
and
countenance
were
alike
much
more
contemporaneous
than
his
partner
his
dress
was
fashionable
and
he
wore
a
carefully
trained
mustache
whose
dark
brown
was
beginning
to
show
threads
of
gray
his
cheeks
and
his
forehead
seemed
in
their
smoothness
as
if
coated
with
some
impermeable
and
indestructible
he
had
a
resolute
chin
and
a
pair
of
hard
eyes
which
were
set
much
too
close
together
to
leave
great
room
for
any
attribution
of
an
generosity
he
and
bates
under
marshall
promptings
bowed
icily
and
a
cold
and
chilling
silence
immediately
ensued
just
like
me
said
bates
as
she
effected
a
hurried
departure
to
blunder
up
against
him
as
i
did
i
wonder
if
he
and
david
get
along
at
all
well
together
and
the
idea
of
my
extending
invitations
to
dinner
under
his
very
nose
well
it
ca
be
helped
now
she
thought
this
the
only
offence
of
which
belden
might
accuse
her
but
he
was
piqued
by
her
apparent
disparagement
of
their
building
and
he
was
still
more
incensed
by
her
having
called
on
his
partner
at
their
place
of
business
for
marshall
must
know
everybody
must
know
that
the
beldens
though
neighbors
of
the
bateses
had
never
been
admitted
and
never
were
to
be
admitted
into
their
house
belden
stood
behind
the
vast
spread
of
dingy
and
watched
bingham
putting
bates
into
her
carriage
he
found
additional
offence
in
the
gay
nod
which
she
sent
to
marshall
through
the
carriage
window
in
spite
of
you
he
muttered
we
are
moving
up
in
spite
of
you
prevent
us
if
you
can
viii
susan
bates
drove
homeward
filled
with
a
vague
dissatisfaction
i
expected
too
much
she
said
to
herself
as
she
half
opened
the
door
again
to
free
the
skirt
that
bingham
had
fastened
there
i
ought
to
have
chosen
a
different
time
and
place
i
might
have
known
that
he
would
be
deep
in
his
business
i
ought
not
to
have
taken
him
with
the
harness
actually
on
his
back
she
sighed
as
she
thought
of
all
the
things
she
had
meant
to
say
but
had
come
away
without
saying
the
thousand
and
one
minor
reminiscences
of
those
early
days
in
the
straggling
and
struggling
prairie
town
she
had
imagined
a
mutual
evocation
of
the
past
and
it
had
not
been
accomplished
but
presently
consolation
came
she
realized
all
at
once
that
her
present
mood
was
but
one
of
those
early
reminiscences
made
modern
she
recalled
now
how
many
times
he
had
taken
his
departure
from
that
little
parlor
leaving
her
to
feel
just
as
she
felt
now
piqued
balked
impatient
over
his
slow
taciturn
unresponsive
ways
but
her
impatience
and
her
pique
had
always
passed
off
in
due
time
and
he
had
always
returned
his
same
kindly
and
inscrutable
self
i
believe
he
meant
to
do
the
best
he
could
anyway
i
shall
follow
things
up
all
the
same
she
declared
to
the
opposite
cushions
her
thought
deflected
in
the
direction
of
belden
i
wonder
how
they
get
along
together
he
is
not
at
all
the
man
that
i
should
think
of
david
being
associated
with
as
a
matter
of
choice
i
never
heard
how
the
partnership
began
i
never
understood
why
it
kept
up
so
long
as
it
has
the
partnership
as
a
matter
of
fact
dated
back
twenty
years
and
had
originated
through
a
kind
of
crisis
in
the
affairs
of
marshall
the
only
weak
spot
in
the
history
of
the
firm
after
several
years
of
unbroken
prosperity
david
marshall
with
thousands
of
others
had
been
overtaken
by
fire
a
year
or
two
later
fire
was
followed
by
panic
and
marshall
felt
himself
crowded
towards
the
brink
of
ruin
in
a
moment
of
weakness
he
permitted
himself
a
course
to
which
only
so
great
an
emergency
could
have
prompted
him
the
situation
was
saved
by
a
species
of
legerdemain
of
so
to
speak
which
was
quite
outside
the
lines
of
mercantile
morality
and
barely
inside
the
lines
of
legality
itself
an
instrument
willing
to
lend
itself
to
this
feat
of
juggling
was
needed
and
was
found
in
a
pushing
young
fellow
who
left
a
rival
house
to
play
discreetly
and
shrewdly
the
r√¥le
of
that
the
juncture
required
marshall
had
long
ago
made
full
amends
to
the
men
whose
welfare
he
had
temporarily
sacrificed
to
his
own
salvation
but
he
had
never
shaken
off
belden
who
remained
constantly
as
a
reminder
of
his
early
and
only
lapse
from
rectitude
in
moments
when
conscience
became
tender
under
the
quickening
touch
of
reminiscence
belden
was
upon
him
not
only
as
a
punishment
but
as
an
incubus
belden
had
never
yielded
a
single
inch
of
the
foothold
gained
by
his
sudden
intrusion
upon
the
affairs
of
the
concern
his
first
demand
was
for
the
headship
of
a
department
he
had
required
next
an
interest
as
a
partner
he
had
exacted
more
lately
the
presence
of
his
name
in
the
style
and
title
of
the
firm
and
he
was
moving
towards
the
making
of
the
firm
over
into
a
stock
company
he
was
younger
than
marshall
stronger
more
aggressive
more
ambitious
more
adventuresome
nor
was
it
difficult
to
imagine
him
as
fundamentally
insolent
and
selfish
his
standard
of
mercantile
morality
was
never
higher
than
at
the
beginning
and
his
standard
of
social
propriety
was
felt
to
leave
much
to
desire
his
first
entry
into
the
firm
seemed
to
have
been
accompanied
by
a
clairvoyant
confidence
and
assurance
and
ambition
he
was
understood
to
have
divorced
his
first
wife
an
amiable
faithful
but
limited
little
creature
under
circumstances
of
some
cruelty
and
even
barbarity
to
form
a
second
union
more
in
harmony
with
his
mounting
ideas
for
the
future
a
subtle
atmosphere
of
distaste
and
disapproval
had
enveloped
him
and
his
for
many
years
and
the
social
advances
of
himself
and
his
wife
had
been
however
determined
but
slow
almost
imperceptible
finally
what
could
not
be
accomplished
in
the
west
was
accomplished
to
some
extent
in
the
east
statira
belden
was
of
new
england
origin
her
family
had
resided
for
years
in
a
small
town
which
the
taste
of
a
few
boston
families
of
consideration
was
turning
into
a
summer
resort
they
contrived
their
cottages
and
she
contrived
hers
she
discreetly
renovated
the
old
homestead
as
she
called
it
and
arranged
to
reside
in
eastern
massachusetts
through
the
summer
season
she
made
a
few
careful
acquaintances
among
her
neighbors
and
presently
found
it
possible
to
spend
a
profitable
and
distinguished
winter
month
in
the
back
bay
one
step
more
brought
her
to
her
goal
social
exchange
between
boston
and
new
york
being
practically
at
par
she
passed
from
one
town
to
the
other
with
an
unimpaired
currency
in
manhattan
she
was
received
with
sufficient
frequency
by
people
sufficiently
distinguished
and
announcements
in
correspondence
with
the
facts
were
borne
westward
by
various
metropolitan
dailies
and
weeklies
she
herself
followed
in
due
course
she
had
now
conquered
a
certain
foothold
at
home
and
her
progress
there
was
distinctly
perceptible
the
last
stronghold
of
the
opposition
existed
much
to
her
mortification
in
her
own
immediate
neighborhood
where
a
stubborn
little
clique
as
she
called
it
continued
under
the
leadership
of
susan
bates
to
ignore
her
the
belden
measuring
diagonally
across
the
street
was
three
hundred
feet
from
that
of
the
bateses
but
the
distance
might
as
well
have
been
three
hundred
miles
bates
who
on
some
occasion
or
other
had
met
her
face
to
face
continued
to
hold
sturdily
the
impression
that
her
eyes
were
at
once
too
furtive
and
too
bold
and
that
her
hair
was
too
yellow
for
a
woman
of
her
age
or
for
that
matter
too
yellow
for
a
woman
of
age
in
view
of
these
considerations
and
others
bates
was
the
reverse
of
pleased
when
jane
one
morning
came
up
to
her
little
room
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
announced
that
belden
among
others
was
likely
to
be
bidden
to
rosy
ma
does
like
her
so
extra
well
jane
admitted
candidly
she
thinks
they
might
have
done
something
for
rosy
this
past
summer
but
it
would
seem
awful
to
pa
if
his
own
partner
wife
was
asked
and
besides
we
do
know
so
very
many
people
ask
anyway
bates
had
made
her
advances
in
due
form
to
the
women
of
the
marshall
family
throughout
the
call
the
talk
had
been
frankly
inevitably
personal
and
susan
bates
had
treated
eliza
marshall
whose
difficult
and
captious
character
she
at
once
apprehended
with
the
most
elaborate
and
ingenious
simplicity
rosy
was
passed
in
review
and
then
dexterously
dispensed
with
after
having
aroused
the
caller
interest
and
approval
and
the
subsequent
talk
ran
along
quite
freely
on
the
child
deserts
and
prospects
bates
was
quite
direct
and
unadorned
and
though
future
was
the
only
common
ground
upon
which
the
two
women
could
meet
yet
she
handled
this
material
with
such
a
sympathetic
persistence
that
eliza
marshall
was
fain
to
believe
that
she
and
her
caller
had
been
knit
in
a
close
community
of
interests
from
time
immemorial
bates
divined
readily
enough
that
nothing
would
be
more
galling
to
eliza
marshall
than
a
betrayal
of
her
own
social
ignorance
how
glad
we
ought
to
be
she
said
in
an
innocent
fashion
that
girls
are
no
longer
brought
out
at
a
crush
imagine
once
more
that
crowd
of
people
surging
up
and
down
your
stairs
and
trampling
each
other
underfoot
as
they
try
to
dance
in
a
room
not
a
quarter
big
enough
and
ten
times
too
many
poor
flowers
wilting
all
over
the
house
and
a
big
band
of
music
going
it
for
dear
life
and
fifty
or
a
hundred
carnages
tangled
up
in
a
noisy
crowd
outside
why
go
through
all
that
for
the
sake
of
getting
a
new
little
girl
acquainted
with
a
few
of
her
friends
eliza
marshall
fastened
her
intent
but
inexpressive
gaze
upon
her
caller
face
and
said
never
a
word
the
function
thus
sketched
by
bates
was
the
precise
function
that
for
the
past
fortnight
she
had
been
imagining
and
dreading
she
had
filled
her
secluded
old
parlors
with
the
squeak
and
the
blare
of
music
alien
draperies
in
their
swift
gyrations
had
whisked
her
immemorial
ornaments
from
her
immemorial
old
whatnot
in
the
a
squad
of
waiters
had
opposed
a
firm
front
to
the
hungry
hordes
that
assaulted
the
various
viands
on
the
table
and
a
thousand
teasing
points
of
form
and
usage
had
afflicted
her
with
worry
uncertainty
and
possible
mortification
and
despair
she
saw
now
that
nothing
like
her
imagined
entertainment
was
desirable
or
even
tolerable
and
she
gave
unconsciously
a
little
sigh
of
relief
bates
divined
further
that
having
instructed
ignorance
she
must
now
allay
timidity
she
must
represent
the
coming
function
as
a
mere
bagatelle
for
simplicity
and
informality
is
it
pleasant
to
think
that
things
are
being
made
so
much
easier
for
us
than
they
used
to
be
otherwise
i
should
have
been
dead
long
before
this
nothing
to
do
but
for
our
little
girl
to
stand
up
with
her
mother
and
two
or
three
of
her
mother
friends
in
one
room
and
for
two
or
three
other
people
to
look
after
the
tea
and
other
things
in
some
other
room
off
behind
somewhere
or
other
bates
waved
her
hand
genially
towards
the
rear
rooms
when
lottie
came
out
i
said
to
ingles
you
must
just
take
the
tea
part
of
it
off
my
hands
get
some
girls
for
me
you
know
about
the
ones
i
want
and
see
that
their
gowns
are
right
and
then
i
shall
be
at
peace
knowing
that
people
are
nibbling
their
biscuits
or
crackers
this
in
a
tone
unconsciously
expository
with
their
spoons
as
they
ought
to
a
few
of
course
really
drank
tea
but
the
others
well
they
had
had
tea
somewhere
half
an
hour
before
or
expected
to
have
it
somewhere
half
an
hour
after
how
tired
we
all
get
of
this
old
rigmarole
do
we
eliza
marshall
bowed
gravely
for
her
this
tiresome
old
rigmarole
was
a
complete
novelty
lyddy
niece
she
said
turning
to
jane
that
girl
from
madison
she
could
pour
for
one
could
she
sure
assented
jane
niece
too
sort
o
she
added
correctively
for
eliza
marshall
made
little
of
certain
vague
ties
to
a
bates
cast
her
eye
round
the
dim
room
one
might
have
fancied
her
as
exploring
for
the
portraits
of
two
or
three
mature
female
relations
of
the
marshalls
i
do
know
whether
i
am
right
in
asking
it
she
began
with
a
fetching
pretence
of
hesitancy
but
i
am
an
old
friend
of
the
family
in
a
sense
and
so
interested
in
rosy
too
if
i
might
help
you
receive
marshall
heard
this
proposal
with
a
second
little
sigh
of
relief
and
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
indeed
outside
of
rhodes
and
possibly
belden
she
had
absolutely
no
one
to
whom
she
could
turn
and
aunt
lyddy
for
another
said
jane
yes
assented
bates
in
the
tone
of
indorsement
rhodes
and
i
are
acquainted
with
a
sly
look
towards
jane
and
there
with
your
other
sister
perhaps
our
little
party
is
made
up
and
about
the
people
to
be
invited
eliza
marshall
proceeded
with
some
little
show
of
initiative
her
task
was
becoming
less
and
less
formidable
she
felt
herself
approaching
this
supposed
ordeal
with
something
almost
like
buoyancy
let
have
it
nice
and
little
and
cosey
suggested
bates
with
a
cosey
little
air
of
her
own
or
thirty
at
the
outside
she
wondered
inwardly
where
even
so
small
a
number
could
be
got
why
would
do
if
they
were
the
right
six
and
why
should
we
want
more
than
three
carriages
before
the
house
at
any
one
time
not
to
have
a
man
shouting
numbers
i
hope
she
drew
her
wraps
together
and
rose
to
go
if
i
might
ask
for
cards
for
one
or
two
of
my
own
friends
nice
pleasant
people
who
would
be
glad
to
become
acquainted
among
the
old
families
she
added
diplomatically
if
she
can
only
be
kept
from
suspecting
how
swell
they
really
are
till
it
all
over
was
the
good
creature
inner
thought
of
course
appearance
here
is
public
nor
any
equivalent
for
it
that
will
come
later
i
myself
shall
want
to
do
something
for
her
on
the
south
side
and
there
will
be
one
or
two
good
houses
for
her
on
the
north
side
oh
our
little
duck
will
swim
when
once
put
into
the
pond
as
you
shall
see
after
we
shall
want
only
a
kind
papa
to
pay
the
bills
and
a
patient
maid
to
sit
up
until
three
or
four
in
the
morning
bates
got
herself
away
in
great
and
kept
that
humor
until
the
following
day
when
jane
came
to
announce
the
participation
of
belden
have
her
pour
tea
cried
susan
bates
without
a
moment
hesitation
let
her
come
early
and
let
her
stay
late
and
pour
and
pour
and
pour
until
the
last
cup
is
drunk
i
ca
promise
your
mother
that
i
shall
be
there
throughout
but
i
will
be
there
for
half
an
hour
during
the
middle
perhaps
and
tea
well
i
never
drink
it
even
at
home
jane
looked
at
her
in
some
surprise
and
do
let
your
mother
change
her
rooms
any
bates
went
on
rapidly
they
right
as
they
are
in
perfect
agreement
they
have
a
quiet
tone
and
a
low
quiet
tone
after
all
is
the
best
thing
and
the
hardest
thing
to
get
and
not
too
many
flowers
never
fear
said
jane
grimly
she
wo
change
anything
and
do
let
her
have
too
much
on
the
table
give
them
tea
and
chocolate
and
sandwiches
and
albert
biscuits
that
plenty
and
if
your
second
girl
shows
a
cap
would
do
no
harm
put
a
slice
of
lemon
in
every
cup
that
discourages
lots
of
people
jane
laughed
but
ma
does
want
to
discourage
her
friends
my
good
girl
said
bates
impressively
this
whole
function
has
only
one
object
that
object
is
to
show
your
sister
for
five
minutes
to
cecilia
ingles
oh
that
it
that
it
and
all
of
it
bates
function
came
off
on
the
appointed
afternoon
and
was
so
limited
in
size
and
so
simple
in
character
that
eliza
marshall
would
have
reproached
herself
for
slighting
her
own
child
had
not
susan
bates
before
her
early
departure
whispered
in
the
old
lady
ear
a
word
of
complete
approbation
rosy
herself
flashed
and
sparkled
in
the
dim
and
depressing
old
parlor
like
a
garnet
set
in
dull
gold
indeed
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
showed
some
of
the
hard
glitter
of
such
a
jewelled
fabrication
as
well
as
its
splendor
cecilia
ingles
who
could
not
but
admire
her
beauty
and
her
readiness
thought
that
her
tone
was
a
little
too
hard
and
that
in
her
excess
of
aplomb
she
pushed
to
the
verge
of
rosy
in
fact
entered
society
not
with
the
tentative
step
and
slow
advance
of
one
who
cautiously
feels
an
unaccustomed
way
but
by
a
single
confident
and
intuitive
leap
as
she
stood
there
beside
her
mother
dressed
in
a
pale
yellow
gown
and
playing
carelessly
with
her
bunch
of
red
roses
she
shifted
any
embarrassment
incident
to
the
occasion
from
her
own
shoulders
to
those
of
her
mother
friends
two
or
three
of
whom
retired
and
aging
persons
withdrew
feeling
their
own
social
rustiness
quite
keenly
jane
who
had
no
definite
r√¥le
to
play
but
who
did
general
utility
all
over
the
house
was
enabled
to
observe
various
episodes
from
various
points
of
view
when
the
actual
test
came
she
had
little
more
aptitude
for
the
social
graces
than
her
mother
had
and
she
imitated
her
own
cautious
reserve
she
did
not
meet
ingles
at
all
but
she
witnessed
from
a
distant
doorway
the
conjunction
which
bates
effected
between
the
leading
luminary
of
the
day
and
the
asteroid
jane
ungrudgingly
acknowledged
cecilia
ingles
to
be
magnificently
beautiful
and
her
dress
to
be
a
miracle
of
taste
and
her
advances
to
be
most
winningly
gracious
and
she
just
about
my
own
age
too
thought
poor
jane
in
comparison
and
the
way
that
little
chit
stands
up
there
and
talks
to
her
i
could
for
a
hundred
worlds
rosy
acts
as
if
she
was
just
as
pretty
herself
well
i
suppose
she
is
and
of
just
as
good
position
h
all
right
enough
i
sure
and
just
as
used
to
the
ways
of
the
world
well
so
she
will
be
fast
enough
and
the
dear
girl
gave
a
long
slow
sigh
partly
that
the
family
had
at
last
such
a
champion
partly
that
she
herself
should
have
been
doomed
to
such
complete
uselessness
in
so
high
a
cause
she
quite
failed
to
realize
that
she
alone
and
no
other
was
the
real
of
her
family
tardy
spurt
as
for
bates
jane
caught
quite
another
side
of
her
she
showed
herself
profoundly
formal
and
punctilious
she
seemed
to
have
dilated
for
the
occasion
with
the
express
determination
of
dominating
it
she
acts
mighty
queer
said
honest
jane
who
was
the
same
to
one
and
all
and
tomorrow
but
i
suppose
she
knows
what
tone
to
take
if
she
acts
like
that
though
the
next
time
i
see
her
i
shall
want
to
stop
knowing
her
she
calls
it
a
and
i
suppose
she
trying
to
make
it
like
one
but
one
enough
jane
observed
furthermore
that
her
aunt
lydia
was
inclined
to
neglect
her
own
part
in
the
ceremony
in
order
to
perform
pirouettes
and
so
to
speak
before
the
of
the
tropics
if
aunt
lyddy
forgets
after
all
said
jane
anxiously
and
mention
florida
why
i
told
a
fib
for
nothing
jane
had
informed
rhodes
that
the
bateses
had
lost
their
youngest
child
at
jacksonville
and
so
could
not
bear
the
slightest
mention
of
the
south
though
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
youngest
child
of
the
bateses
was
a
lusty
youth
of
eighteen
with
strong
hopes
of
becoming
one
of
the
yale
football
team
next
season
in
the
midst
of
the
ceremonial
truesdale
sauntered
in
and
passed
through
the
rooms
with
a
graceful
indifference
he
was
the
last
to
be
disconcerted
by
an
assemblage
purely
feminine
he
had
doffed
for
the
hour
most
of
his
imported
eccentricities
in
the
way
of
dress
and
had
consented
to
appear
properly
enough
in
a
black
with
extremely
long
skirts
he
had
an
orchid
in
his
a
large
one
very
vivid
and
flamboyant
jane
had
looked
rather
for
a
chrysanthemum
one
of
those
immeasurable
blooms
worn
by
the
young
men
in
but
dick
be
individual
she
acknowledged
thank
goodness
it
was
a
peony
or
worse
he
look
nice
if
he
is
my
brother
and
he
the
only
young
man
i
know
with
violet
eyes
truesdale
drifted
into
the
and
jane
presently
saw
him
lounging
in
a
chair
alongside
bertie
patterson
the
table
was
officered
after
the
fashion
that
bates
had
suggested
by
belden
who
in
the
absence
of
her
own
daughter
kept
away
by
illness
had
brought
instead
another
girl
her
daughter
friend
a
visitor
from
new
york
truesdale
failed
to
catch
her
name
belden
herself
was
somewhat
large
and
inclined
to
be
a
bit
and
an
excess
of
blond
down
lined
her
cheeks
just
below
and
before
her
ears
and
her
eyebrows
spread
themselves
rather
broadly
and
dispersedly
on
her
forehead
a
superfluity
of
hair
of
a
shade
essentially
improbable
waved
about
her
ears
and
temples
and
a
high
gold
comb
emphasized
the
loose
knot
into
which
it
was
drawn
behind
she
would
do
better
on
the
stage
truesdale
said
to
himself
she
has
gotten
herself
up
for
the
photographer
and
if
all
those
rings
are
her
own
she
has
more
than
any
one
woman
needs
the
girl
with
her
whose
name
presently
came
to
him
as
gladys
gladys
what
he
wondered
let
herself
loose
on
him
at
once
with
a
fusillade
of
ready
familiarities
the
field
was
clear
for
bertie
patterson
at
his
side
had
few
words
to
interpose
her
large
brown
eyes
rested
half
appealingly
upon
him
in
the
intervals
of
her
constrained
and
halting
little
service
and
he
readily
divined
the
poor
child
as
in
a
lonely
and
uncomfortable
minority
is
only
my
second
time
she
said
to
him
with
a
kind
of
appealing
protest
you
must
watch
me
and
criticise
me
she
had
just
finished
her
ministrations
on
a
pair
of
family
friends
whom
rosy
in
the
fulness
of
her
social
efflorescence
had
banished
for
consolation
and
reassurance
to
the
somehow
the
guests
that
had
fallen
to
her
side
of
the
table
had
all
been
of
this
character
when
was
the
first
why
do
you
know
the
day
you
you
oh
day
laughed
truesdale
i
did
know
you
were
there
of
course
you
must
have
thought
me
absurd
no
not
not
absurd
but
on
such
a
long
wide
street
with
so
many
handsome
houses
all
around
truesdale
smiled
poor
little
thing
i
believe
she
admires
michigan
avenue
i
believe
she
impressed
by
it
to
him
this
thoroughfare
was
not
completely
innocent
of
the
cheap
and
vulgar
restlessness
which
is
the
dominant
note
of
all
american
street
architecture
but
let
her
admire
it
if
she
can
think
what
i
expected
to
find
piccadilly
i
enjoy
driving
down
it
so
much
she
continued
confidentially
yet
with
a
shy
little
look
as
if
trying
to
learn
whether
her
confidence
was
misplaced
aunt
lydia
and
i
go
shopping
almost
every
day
ten
kilometres
down
and
back
estimated
truesdale
ten
kilometres
of
luxury
and
grandeur
do
let
it
overpower
you
and
you
are
learning
where
the
shops
are
i
suppose
and
the
theatres
and
the
perhaps
and
the
hotels
and
what
all
besides
no
said
bertie
patterson
proudly
i
knew
all
that
before
i
came
there
are
books
you
know
and
maps
i
studied
them
at
home
beforehand
truesdale
had
never
seen
any
of
the
books
but
he
thought
their
existence
probable
enough
he
remembered
to
his
own
maps
how
he
had
become
familiar
with
the
london
clubs
long
before
walking
through
pall
mall
and
how
he
knew
where
to
find
all
the
paris
theatres
years
previous
to
his
first
stroll
along
the
boulevard
and
you
have
been
to
all
the
high
places
i
suppose
i
been
to
the
top
of
the
masonic
temple
and
to
the
places
were
they
have
the
and
the
gates
ajar
and
the
american
flag
made
of
of
heaven
knows
what
the
parks
yes
we
have
been
to
one
or
two
of
them
but
we
were
a
little
late
for
all
those
lovely
things
most
of
them
had
been
dug
up
lovely
things
groaned
truesdale
fancy
them
in
the
bois
or
along
the
row
or
anywhere
but
here
yet
he
felt
sure
that
she
had
his
own
fondness
for
and
points
of
view
she
had
doubtless
anticipated
the
masonic
temple
and
washington
park
just
as
he
had
anticipated
the
pincian
and
the
tower
of
the
capitol
his
forgave
her
this
crudity
after
all
she
was
praising
what
she
had
never
seen
i
been
to
your
parks
myself
the
other
girl
broke
in
as
she
glanced
round
the
vase
of
chrysanthemums
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
but
if
you
want
to
see
a
park
come
to
new
york
she
was
rather
abrupt
and
boisterous
truesdale
wondered
if
she
had
not
at
one
time
been
a
tomboy
and
i
know
where
ever
so
many
of
the
society
people
live
bertie
went
on
in
a
low
tone
which
implored
him
not
to
repeat
and
above
all
not
to
laugh
i
saw
a
book
once
with
all
their
addresses
and
i
marked
the
places
on
the
map
truesdale
did
smile
here
crumbling
the
while
a
biscuit
on
the
corner
of
the
table
he
smiled
not
because
she
had
seemed
to
refer
to
society
people
as
a
distinct
and
unique
order
of
beings
but
from
pure
sympathy
he
himself
had
placed
stafford
house
and
bridgewater
house
and
all
the
other
town
residences
of
the
english
aristocracy
in
those
same
days
when
he
had
found
sites
for
the
pall
mall
clubs
yes
she
went
on
i
know
where
bates
lives
and
ingles
and
lots
of
other
prominent
people
upon
my
word
cried
truesdale
in
generous
emulation
just
what
i
did
in
paris
i
went
all
up
and
down
the
rue
de
crenelle
and
the
rue
dominique
trying
to
select
the
right
sort
of
hotels
houses
you
know
for
the
viscountess
of
beauseant
and
the
duchess
of
langeais
and
the
princess
galathionne
and
all
those
great
ladies
in
balzac
in
balzac
novels
he
added
considerately
but
bates
is
in
a
novel
oh
no
she
real
i
hope
so
you
have
covered
the
north
side
and
the
south
side
and
all
you
know
us
through
and
through
this
talk
about
the
girl
opposite
broke
in
again
she
took
the
other
way
round
the
chrysanthemums
we
have
in
new
york
but
nobody
you
know
lives
on
them
fancy
nice
people
scattered
in
squads
all
over
a
city
and
having
their
shops
and
clubs
and
theatres
all
jumbled
up
in
the
middle
along
with
everything
else
it
horrid
truesdale
nodded
across
to
the
girl
and
smiled
brightly
he
wondered
if
she
were
really
quite
where
do
you
suppose
i
went
night
before
last
with
aunt
lydia
bertie
resumed
as
she
fingered
the
remaining
two
or
three
of
a
row
of
shining
teaspoons
to
the
opera
in
an
undertone
to
aunt
lydia
could
get
a
box
she
said
they
were
all
taken
for
the
season
but
we
had
seats
close
to
one
side
just
below
the
boxes
such
a
grand
place
ever
since
the
auditorium
was
opened
i
been
hoping
to
see
it
and
now
i
have
congratulations
cried
truesdale
heartily
and
belden
turned
round
to
see
the
reason
for
it
he
remembered
how
he
himself
had
panted
for
the
scala
and
for
the
apollo
at
rome
that
poor
apollo
razed
to
the
ground
before
ever
he
could
behold
its
historic
stage
i
been
to
your
opera
myself
the
other
girl
proclaimed
what
was
the
matter
with
all
the
box
people
anyway
they
seemed
afraid
to
assert
themselves
i
never
saw
a
lot
of
rich
people
so
do
you
mean
that
they
kept
quiet
during
the
performance
asked
truesdale
the
effect
rather
primitive
was
it
whenever
sing
i
always
ask
the
whole
room
to
if
somebody
shows
any
sign
of
listening
and
i
thought
they
looked
pretty
plain
too
the
girl
volunteered
further
if
you
want
to
see
style
and
display
take
the
metropolitan
on
a
real
gala
night
i
did
see
half
a
dozen
necklaces
among
your
people
and
not
a
single
tiara
you
should
have
worn
yours
declared
truesdale
genially
every
one
would
have
helped
yes
she
seemed
truly
and
the
worst
type
of
a
person
at
that
the
person
away
from
home
let
have
them
he
whispered
to
bertie
as
a
brace
of
crossed
the
threshold
she
take
them
anyway
said
bertie
ruefully
she
did
not
at
all
seem
to
realize
the
greater
triumph
of
completely
monopolizing
the
one
man
present
i
wanted
to
walk
in
the
foy
in
the
place
where
they
promenade
bertie
went
on
such
a
lovely
place
and
such
a
grand
crush
under
all
those
yellow
arches
but
we
did
have
any
gentleman
she
concluded
lamely
never
mind
you
have
one
next
time
responded
truesdale
gallantly
i
awfully
fond
of
that
place
already
the
whole
of
it
it
one
of
the
few
good
things
they
got
here
it
the
only
place
in
town
where
you
can
see
any
number
of
nice
people
together
oh
really
protested
belden
speaking
to
him
for
the
first
time
she
had
decided
that
he
was
worth
talking
to
as
well
as
concluded
that
his
attentions
had
been
given
too
exclusively
to
one
side
of
the
table
oh
really
now
her
voice
was
thickly
sweetly
sibilant
i
shall
hope
to
show
you
that
you
are
wrong
gladys
child
remind
me
to
send
this
young
man
a
card
for
a
week
from
wednesday
very
well
answered
truesdale
i
perfectly
willing
to
be
convinced
only
do
ask
me
to
a
dinner
i
ca
sit
through
a
dinner
a
little
bit
of
a
tea
well
that
different
and
he
turned
his
friendly
eyes
in
the
direction
of
bertie
patterson
it
is
a
dinner
said
belden
as
brusquely
as
her
vocalization
would
allow
it
but
a
advanced
and
she
turned
to
manipulate
her
teapot
with
her
large
fair
plump
hands
bertie
patterson
smiled
at
truesdale
in
return
she
seemed
to
consider
herself
indebted
to
him
not
only
for
that
vague
promise
of
future
festivities
but
for
a
certain
degree
of
moral
support
at
a
juncture
which
might
have
brought
her
mortification
if
not
actual
tears
what
a
downright
nice
little
soul
she
is
anyway
thought
truesdale
there
are
nice
good
girls
in
this
world
after
all
and
some
of
them
are
right
here
and
how
she
idealizes
this
brutal
and
ugly
town
if
only
she
does
idealize
truesdale
had
been
idealized
more
than
once
before
sometimes
the
result
had
been
merely
embarrassing
sometimes
disastrous
ix
it
may
be
remembered
that
truesdale
in
making
an
estimate
of
the
resources
of
his
native
town
upon
the
occasion
of
his
return
to
it
had
scheduled
the
tea
as
the
last
resource
of
all
if
we
find
him
present
then
at
such
a
function
we
may
imagine
him
to
have
found
the
possibilities
of
local
entertainment
much
slighter
than
he
had
figured
and
time
already
hanging
somewhat
heavily
on
his
hands
nor
need
we
make
any
allowance
for
the
fact
that
the
debutante
was
his
sister
and
the
scene
of
her
his
own
mother
house
the
catholic
tolerance
of
his
sympathies
was
such
as
to
make
his
interest
in
his
relatives
as
relatives
no
greater
than
his
interest
in
other
people
whose
general
qualities
would
be
likely
to
receive
equal
recognition
from
the
world
at
large
and
his
outlook
was
so
broad
as
to
make
his
house
but
one
of
many
houses
and
to
subject
happenings
in
it
to
the
same
criterion
as
would
be
used
to
judge
and
rate
the
happenings
in
any
other
house
throughout
christendom
truesdale
considered
himself
as
admirably
and
flawlessly
a
cosmopolite
yes
he
had
done
his
sister
tea
but
not
until
he
had
done
almost
everything
else
he
went
to
the
few
good
concerts
that
offered
he
made
a
fortnightly
visit
to
the
art
stores
and
he
patronized
so
far
as
he
could
endure
them
the
theatres
the
chief
and
final
resource
of
the
town
but
the
concerts
were
a
factor
far
from
constant
and
the
theatres
offered
scarcely
once
a
month
a
play
that
a
person
of
taste
and
intelligence
cared
to
sit
through
abroad
he
had
been
a
valiant
but
he
learned
presently
that
at
home
the
house
for
a
premiere
was
composed
largely
of
people
whose
tickets
came
from
the
exposition
of
theatre
paper
throughout
the
week
in
their
storefronts
it
was
on
monday
evening
that
they
were
paid
off
and
he
found
himself
little
disposed
to
join
in
judgment
with
a
raft
of
small
until
he
recollected
that
a
premiere
was
not
a
premiere
after
all
the
play
footing
having
already
been
secured
at
some
other
place
at
some
other
time
before
some
other
audience
as
for
the
he
complained
that
a
canvas
of
any
importance
was
likely
to
be
displayed
after
a
fashion
frankly
mercantile
in
the
of
the
shop
a
step
which
met
more
than
halfway
the
public
demand
for
free
art
but
which
unjustly
caused
many
an
original
to
be
taken
for
a
copy
perhaps
though
he
would
say
the
public
has
got
so
far
along
as
to
judge
of
a
picture
independent
of
its
surroundings
possibly
the
crimson
draperies
and
the
row
of
have
really
come
to
be
superfluous
he
missed
furthermore
many
of
his
accustomed
pleasures
and
conveniences
he
was
astonished
to
find
a
metropolis
without
a
promenade
true
on
sunday
afternoons
there
was
a
good
deal
of
strolling
up
and
down
along
a
of
the
lake
shore
but
he
never
observed
that
the
people
whose
houses
overlooked
all
this
strolling
ever
took
any
part
in
it
and
he
never
learned
that
they
enjoyed
this
diversion
anywhere
else
singular
he
said
no
concerted
walking
or
driving
no
understanding
as
to
any
time
for
it
no
understanding
as
to
any
place
for
it
not
the
slightest
social
organization
for
life
how
much
there
must
be
with
a
backward
thought
towards
rosy
debut
somewhere
he
deplored
the
absolute
of
the
institution
known
as
the
caf√©
all
the
more
in
view
of
the
long
months
of
waiting
that
must
intervene
before
he
should
be
able
to
gain
membership
in
some
club
the
caf√©
that
crowning
gem
in
the
coronet
of
civilization
the
name
was
everywhere
the
thing
nowhere
nothing
offered
save
a
few
large
places
of
general
and
promiscuous
resort
which
under
one
ameliorative
title
or
another
dispensed
prompt
refreshment
amid
furnishings
of
the
most
reverberant
vulgarity
it
impossible
he
said
in
one
of
these
places
one
day
to
one
of
his
artists
a
from
milan
either
you
stand
here
in
front
of
this
counter
facing
all
that
superfluous
glassware
and
that
cheap
young
man
with
the
dreadful
hair
and
the
reflections
of
all
those
hideous
daubs
behind
you
or
else
you
retire
to
one
of
those
along
the
side
there
and
make
the
disposal
of
a
bottle
of
light
beer
seem
a
disreputable
orgy
or
a
dark
conspiracy
or
a
combination
of
both
not
one
word
against
the
pictures
replied
the
other
how
else
here
do
i
live
no
journals
pursued
truesdale
no
no
client√®le
no
leisure
no
he
added
with
the
idea
of
a
more
general
summing
up
nor
any
excursions
nor
any
general
market
nor
any
military
nor
even
any
morgue
and
five
francs
for
a
cab
to
truesdale
the
caf√©
was
the
great
social
foothold
it
was
here
that
he
was
accustomed
to
meet
on
common
ground
the
whole
male
section
of
society
it
was
to
the
caf√©
that
he
would
like
to
lead
his
young
with
the
portfolio
of
views
from
rural
missouri
or
his
last
new
poet
with
his
thin
little
volume
so
finely
flattened
out
between
the
two
millstones
of
journalism
and
literature
neither
of
which
alone
could
have
ground
him
out
his
grist
in
livable
quantities
in
the
absence
of
the
caf√©
he
led
two
or
three
such
to
the
house
it
was
like
thrusting
a
lighted
candle
into
a
jar
of
nitrogen
the
candle
went
out
at
once
and
never
came
back
to
david
marshall
art
in
all
its
forms
was
an
inexplicable
thing
but
more
inexplicable
still
was
the
fact
that
any
man
could
be
so
feeble
as
to
yield
himself
to
such
trivial
matters
in
a
town
where
money
and
general
success
still
stood
ready
to
meet
any
live
practical
fellow
a
fellow
that
was
to
say
who
knew
an
opportunity
when
he
saw
it
the
desire
of
beauty
was
not
an
inborn
essential
of
the
normal
human
being
art
was
not
an
integral
part
of
the
great
frame
of
things
it
was
a
mere
surface
decoration
and
the
artist
was
but
for
the
adornment
of
the
rich
man
triumph
in
case
the
rich
man
were
on
his
side
so
feeble
as
to
need
to
have
his
triumph
adorned
he
himself
had
taken
hold
of
practical
things
at
an
early
age
he
had
made
something
out
of
nothing
a
good
deal
out
of
nothing
and
compared
with
this
act
of
creation
the
fabrication
of
verses
or
of
pictures
was
a
paltry
affair
indeed
he
was
willing
enough
that
his
daughters
should
improve
themselves
he
was
even
proud
in
a
way
of
jane
ability
to
keep
step
with
the
general
advance
of
female
culture
but
for
any
such
turn
in
one
of
his
sons
he
had
no
sympathy
no
patience
he
conferred
with
truesdale
on
the
possible
reorganization
of
the
business
and
put
before
him
the
appositeness
of
his
coming
in
at
such
a
time
but
truesdale
would
lift
his
brows
and
suck
his
lips
and
study
the
pattern
of
the
carpet
and
mumble
something
about
packing
his
trunk
and
going
somewhere
his
days
in
fact
were
becoming
long
inordinately
so
it
was
to
his
evenings
that
he
was
coming
to
look
exclusively
for
diversion
he
made
the
most
of
these
he
drew
them
out
as
long
as
possible
to
counterbalance
the
days
he
seldom
came
home
before
midnight
frequently
not
before
two
or
three
in
the
morning
occasionally
not
at
all
in
company
with
three
or
four
choice
spirits
arthur
paston
and
his
like
he
turned
night
into
day
and
was
seen
now
and
then
at
such
conjunction
of
place
and
time
as
would
well
have
justified
an
explanation
to
the
or
even
to
the
comparatively
correct
like
his
other
associates
on
these
occasions
he
still
retained
the
enviable
faculty
of
being
able
to
be
nice
to
nice
people
but
he
acknowledged
his
taste
and
his
sensibilities
both
to
be
badly
lacerated
and
he
confessed
now
and
then
with
a
sigh
that
he
had
never
amused
himself
so
indifferently
in
his
life
his
sense
of
ennui
was
in
fact
driving
him
out
upon
society
and
the
hopes
of
his
sister
which
had
drooped
somewhat
after
their
first
now
began
to
lift
themselves
again
jane
on
reviewing
rosy
d√©but
had
arrived
at
a
juster
estimate
of
her
own
share
in
it
she
had
launched
one
member
of
the
family
very
satisfactorily
and
she
felt
herself
prompted
to
the
launching
of
another
rosy
was
now
in
the
full
tide
of
success
the
edge
of
the
wedge
had
been
set
with
singular
acumen
and
the
two
or
three
smart
blows
that
followed
had
opened
up
society
to
her
in
a
twinkling
she
had
appeared
at
a
few
of
the
best
houses
and
had
at
once
entered
upon
a
vogue
her
mirror
was
always
full
of
cards
her
cards
were
always
full
of
names
and
her
own
name
was
always
filling
the
newspapers
she
figured
in
boxes
at
in
booths
at
fancy
fairs
she
had
already
poured
tea
at
six
receptions
and
had
acted
as
bridesmaid
at
two
weddings
an
incessant
stream
had
run
from
the
six
teapots
and
nobody
had
looked
at
the
two
brides
jane
would
sit
up
in
the
dim
library
through
the
small
hours
waiting
for
rosy
ring
and
planning
corresponding
triumphs
for
truesdale
her
first
and
chiefest
task
was
to
get
him
to
take
society
seriously
he
had
professed
himself
as
unable
to
put
his
finger
on
it
he
asked
her
where
it
was
to
be
found
what
was
the
general
platform
on
which
it
met
at
the
charity
ball
she
had
answered
him
rightly
perhaps
wrongly
perhaps
let
us
waive
the
point
then
to
the
charity
ball
i
shall
go
he
had
answered
promptly
will
you
shrilled
jane
oh
goody
and
you
wo
be
disappointed
either
it
the
one
great
magnificent
thing
of
the
year
everybody
goes
and
they
have
in
electric
lights
and
and
champagne
and
two
different
places
to
eat
supper
in
jane
had
never
attended
one
of
these
entertainments
her
wealth
of
picturesque
detail
was
gathered
from
the
newspapers
ouf
said
truesdale
indifferently
discounting
the
magnificence
he
had
been
to
one
ball
at
the
british
embassy
in
rome
and
to
another
at
the
h√¥tel
de
ville
in
paris
and
did
not
expect
to
be
impressed
he
rather
looked
to
find
this
coming
occasion
like
the
latter
a
heterogeneous
assemblage
of
elements
whose
value
was
doubtful
separately
and
not
much
greater
collectively
jane
ran
to
her
fairy
godmother
through
bates
everything
appeared
possible
you
must
put
him
on
the
committee
said
jane
or
you
must
make
him
a
or
something
jane
head
swam
with
a
social
vertigo
she
could
call
spirits
from
the
vasty
deep
and
feel
perfectly
sure
of
their
coming
very
well
responded
bates
a
he
shall
be
he
do
it
splendidly
too
declared
jane
he
so
alert
and
so
and
so
awfully
graceful
and
just
the
right
height
and
a
very
handsome
figure
do
you
think
too
slender
well
of
course
he
no
slugger
retorted
jane
whose
thought
turned
suddenly
towards
the
youthful
footballist
at
yale
yes
she
went
on
he
got
plenty
of
assurance
and
readiness
and
he
do
beautifully
if
he
just
be
disposed
to
take
the
trouble
only
only
he
does
know
anybody
hardly
was
her
dubious
conclusion
never
mind
returned
bates
genially
lots
of
he
know
there
too
many
and
lots
of
he
would
want
to
know
he
can
jump
about
i
imagine
and
see
that
other
people
are
kept
jumping
about
too
the
fewer
he
knows
the
better
he
do
his
work
she
looked
at
jane
steadily
for
a
moment
or
two
one
thing
more
i
want
you
to
come
and
sit
in
my
box
me
squealed
jane
it
was
a
complicated
cry
it
indicated
surprise
gratitude
and
before
all
a
sense
of
divided
duty
bates
all
unsuspected
by
her
subject
had
taken
jane
in
hand
a
month
ago
and
had
made
her
at
length
fairly
presentable
incidentally
she
had
made
herself
a
martyr
but
never
mind
she
would
say
the
poor
child
does
know
how
to
do
herself
justice
so
somebody
else
has
got
to
do
it
for
her
after
a
pretty
thorough
canvass
of
jane
her
hands
her
hair
her
dress
her
carriage
her
complexion
she
began
operations
she
went
for
example
to
a
widely
celebrated
beautifier
as
well
as
to
other
dealers
in
those
lotions
and
cosmetics
which
have
secured
the
recommendation
of
various
singers
and
professional
beauties
and
she
took
jane
with
her
the
good
woman
pretended
alarm
at
the
state
of
her
complexion
as
if
her
robust
health
her
careful
table
her
good
allowance
of
sleep
her
active
circulation
and
her
hundred
varied
forms
of
daily
exercise
all
went
for
naught
so
she
sat
in
parlors
with
cloths
tied
round
her
neck
and
let
people
smear
her
with
creams
and
prod
her
with
electric
needles
and
work
their
will
on
her
for
the
removal
of
all
the
facial
blemishes
that
flesh
is
heir
to
my
dear
girl
she
would
call
over
her
shoulder
to
jane
i
know
this
is
awfully
tiresome
to
you
and
it
must
be
very
painful
to
see
your
old
friend
suffering
so
but
if
you
will
just
wait
patiently
for
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
more
oh
do
mind
me
jane
would
respond
outwardly
bored
but
inwardly
interested
i
getting
along
all
right
go
on
enjoying
your
sufferings
as
long
as
you
please
and
after
a
few
of
these
forenoons
jane
had
realized
her
own
imperfections
and
had
learned
the
means
of
getting
round
them
then
bates
would
convey
her
unconscious
pupil
to
the
she
would
abandon
her
gray
tresses
to
the
manipulations
of
operatives
skilled
to
show
the
possibilities
of
the
natural
material
and
the
magical
supplementary
powers
of
the
unnatural
every
frown
occasioned
by
a
tug
every
tear
produced
by
a
tangle
was
borne
cheerfully
for
the
sake
of
an
ultimate
good
and
jane
acquired
indirectly
a
complete
knowledge
of
all
those
preparations
and
processes
which
her
preceptress
felt
her
needs
required
yes
my
hair
thinning
on
the
forehead
bates
would
admit
if
you
should
happen
to
have
the
precise
match
the
match
was
always
difficult
but
jane
did
not
fail
to
observe
how
easy
the
same
would
be
for
herself
then
bates
would
have
her
manicure
at
the
house
twice
as
often
as
before
to
increase
the
chance
of
her
being
on
hand
some
morning
when
jane
should
drop
in
try
it
yourself
just
to
see
what
it
like
she
would
suggest
and
her
own
plump
and
shapely
hands
would
yield
their
place
on
the
small
red
velvet
cushion
to
the
long
and
graceless
fingers
of
her
prot√©g√©e
and
presently
the
other
processes
the
soakings
the
washings
the
rubbings
would
follow
she
also
recommended
exercise
for
example
what
the
matter
with
fencing
asked
jane
truesdale
you
know
awfully
good
to
me
she
might
have
found
it
difficult
to
cite
any
definite
example
of
truesdale
goodness
perhaps
she
meant
merely
that
he
never
snubbed
her
never
hectored
her
better
yet
fencing
by
all
means
jane
moreover
always
accompanied
bates
to
the
milliner
and
to
the
they
priced
things
debated
things
and
tried
on
things
on
themselves
on
each
other
on
the
attendants
bates
purchased
lavishly
for
herself
and
suggested
lavishly
in
regard
to
purchases
by
jane
you
better
have
this
she
would
say
it
becomes
you
you
wo
find
anything
nicer
but
the
price
jane
would
demur
for
bates
frequented
the
most
expensive
places
and
spent
money
with
a
prodigal
recklessness
i
ca
it
is
right
i
could
think
of
costing
poor
pa
so
much
especially
with
rosy
and
everything
making
such
an
expense
for
him
nonsense
you
entitled
to
some
of
the
good
things
of
life
too
your
father
can
stand
it
i
should
hope
if
he
has
learned
how
to
spend
money
it
high
time
he
did
have
you
any
idea
you
poor
simple
soul
what
he
worth
i
suppose
he
is
pretty
well
off
jane
would
acknowledge
reluctantly
indefinitely
well
off
i
should
say
so
you
ought
to
have
twenty
times
what
you
do
let
them
send
this
home
for
you
i
take
the
risk
thus
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
two
jane
to
the
bewilderment
and
surprise
of
her
mother
and
sisters
and
everybody
else
became
more
presentable
than
ever
before
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
she
fully
merited
in
fact
the
sincere
encomium
finally
bestowed
by
bates
herself
there
now
you
not
the
girl
in
this
town
not
by
a
jugful
jane
was
seriously
affected
by
this
unstinted
praise
and
she
was
almost
overwhelmed
when
her
monitress
showed
the
courage
of
her
convictions
by
offering
a
place
in
her
box
she
mimicked
after
jane
what
does
that
mean
will
you
or
wo
you
if
i
only
could
said
jane
it
the
first
thing
of
any
account
had
a
chance
at
since
i
do
know
when
but
i
got
another
engagement
for
that
evening
i
going
to
the
university
extension
lecture
with
going
to
the
university
extension
lecture
it
my
regular
night
she
ended
with
a
heavy
downward
inflection
which
she
hoped
was
pronounced
enough
to
conceal
the
dislocation
that
had
preceded
it
indeed
where
does
your
lecture
carry
you
over
on
the
west
side
to
that
settlement
um
bad
neighborhood
to
be
going
into
alone
at
night
i
not
going
alone
returned
jane
with
a
kind
of
fluttering
joyfulness
oh
with
some
girl
friends
then
not
much
better
that
way
i
not
going
with
any
girl
friends
this
accompanied
by
a
perceptible
palpitation
of
delight
she
looked
at
bates
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
say
please
go
on
do
stop
right
there
oh
then
that
kind
good
brother
perhaps
suggested
bates
going
on
no
not
that
kind
good
brother
jane
face
was
fairly
beaming
some
other
kind
good
young
man
then
yes
responded
jane
with
a
challenging
light
on
her
countenance
some
other
kind
good
young
man
ah
and
when
does
your
lecture
end
at
nine
before
the
other
thing
begins
of
course
the
lecture
is
much
too
instructive
to
lose
and
then
there
the
fascination
of
a
mile
or
two
in
a
dirty
but
could
you
look
in
on
us
between
ten
and
the
box
is
small
but
i
have
a
great
fondness
for
those
kind
good
young
men
could
you
induce
one
of
them
any
one
at
all
of
course
to
bring
you
if
he
knew
there
was
a
place
waiting
for
you
both
the
gentleman
who
is
going
to
escort
me
began
jane
rising
suddenly
to
a
very
formal
tone
is
well
in
fact
he
he
does
go
out
very
much
she
proceeded
lapsing
back
into
her
former
manner
he
kind
of
quiet
and
retiring
i
do
believe
he
ever
go
to
anything
like
this
not
when
he
got
a
good
place
offered
him
and
a
nice
girl
to
take
with
a
dress
of
just
the
right
sort
to
go
in
i
should
want
a
beau
of
mine
to
have
a
little
more
spunk
than
that
how
can
you
talk
that
way
whimpered
jane
quite
quivering
with
pleasure
i
ca
sit
here
and
listen
to
anything
like
that
what
right
with
a
feint
of
maiden
indignation
what
right
have
you
to
say
that
br
that
anybody
is
is
my
beau
supplied
bates
serenely
beau
that
what
i
said
word
i
know
but
i
ca
think
of
a
better
one
you
just
dreadful
you
are
stammered
jane
trying
to
withdraw
as
best
she
might
from
too
pronounced
an
attitude
of
protest
she
fingered
the
length
of
ravelled
bordering
that
drooped
from
the
cushion
of
her
chair
and
ran
an
eye
pretendedly
speculative
up
and
down
the
pink
and
green
stripes
of
bates
i
pretty
sure
he
would
go
the
gentleman
who
is
to
escort
me
to
the
lecture
she
said
with
another
return
to
her
vain
paraphrase
earnest
he
serious
besides
he
has
got
a
has
got
a
he
does
approve
of
them
he
thinks
they
ugly
and
foolish
and
and
not
right
he
believes
that
society
is
well
not
exactly
wrong
but
all
the
same
declared
bates
he
will
receive
a
ticket
and
i
shall
contrive
to
let
him
know
that
there
a
place
waiting
for
him
oh
no
no
you
must
what
would
he
ever
think
of
me
i
shall
too
no
do
please
do
he
would
know
what
to
think
he
might
think
that
i
i
shall
too
repeated
bates
more
loudly
and
stubbornly
i
shall
too
she
knew
that
anything
less
marked
than
this
would
be
a
chilling
disappointment
to
the
girl
before
her
and
if
he
has
got
a
why
he
can
just
get
one
i
sure
if
a
young
man
cared
anything
for
me
oh
do
talk
that
way
please
do
implored
jane
half
hiding
her
face
with
a
kind
of
despairing
joy
do
say
such
things
i
beg
of
you
i
should
expect
him
to
make
some
little
sacrifice
for
me
bates
completed
let
him
come
and
look
at
us
we
may
not
be
half
so
bad
as
he
imagines
sacrifice
what
a
delightful
and
comforting
sound
the
word
had
to
jane
it
vitalized
in
a
moment
all
her
of
the
past
ten
years
that
anybody
should
ever
be
moved
to
make
a
sacrifice
for
but
he
used
to
live
in
the
settlement
persisted
jane
he
used
to
work
there
he
does
approve
of
charity
balls
he
thinks
that
is
at
all
the
way
to
do
things
well
said
bates
thoughtfully
it
way
but
there
are
better
ones
no
doubt
come
cut
that
lecture
altogether
he
could
pick
up
more
in
half
an
hour
with
me
there
at
his
elbow
than
he
could
learn
in
half
a
dozen
courses
of
lectures
however
extended
they
were
and
have
you
act
as
you
acted
at
rosy
afternoon
you
paralyze
us
both
jane
blushed
at
her
both
oh
that
only
my
little
way
returned
bates
laughing
understand
jane
blushed
again
a
way
she
repeated
but
there
are
better
ones
no
doubt
and
she
laughed
once
more
x
bingham
half
folded
the
newspaper
and
laid
it
again
on
marshall
desk
then
he
settled
his
large
long
figure
back
in
marshall
other
chair
and
placed
a
broad
finger
or
two
upon
each
of
its
curved
and
varnished
arms
yes
he
observed
slowly
with
a
smile
in
the
direction
of
the
old
man
the
younger
generation
are
holding
up
their
end
so
it
seems
said
marshall
in
return
while
he
scanned
the
face
closely
to
see
what
his
precise
meaning
might
be
bingham
remark
had
been
uttered
with
an
even
intonation
it
was
difficult
to
determine
whether
after
all
he
had
emphasized
younger
more
than
generation
or
their
more
than
end
or
indeed
whether
he
had
given
an
undue
stress
to
either
yes
the
old
man
repeated
he
made
another
reference
to
the
newspaper
yes
that
is
my
child
he
fixed
an
eye
half
fascinated
half
protesting
upon
a
large
cut
which
was
set
to
fill
the
width
of
two
columns
it
was
a
portrait
of
rosy
of
miss
rosamund
marshall
as
it
read
with
a
line
or
two
more
vaguely
biographical
in
character
in
italics
beneath
it
was
engraved
with
more
than
the
usual
care
and
printed
with
more
than
the
usual
success
this
was
the
first
time
that
any
woman
of
his
family
had
ever
been
exposed
in
the
public
prints
and
here
are
five
or
six
lines
telling
how
she
was
dressed
is
that
right
bingham
well
i
no
hand
at
describing
i
suppose
it
reads
correctly
enough
at
any
rate
rosamund
was
the
handsomest
girl
there
and
the
best
dressed
so
several
said
and
the
one
who
drew
the
most
attention
is
that
right
bingham
the
old
man
repeated
he
was
accustomed
enough
to
the
public
presentation
of
other
men
daughters
but
this
was
the
first
time
that
such
a
thing
had
befallen
one
of
his
own
oh
replied
bingham
you
mean
way
well
times
change
ten
years
ago
this
would
have
brought
a
protest
and
twenty
a
flogging
and
we
change
with
them
however
if
this
is
the
miss
rosamund
marshall
who
has
begun
lately
to
figure
at
teas
and
receptions
and
cotillons
and
always
contrives
to
be
the
bright
particular
is
it
marshall
smiled
slowly
all
this
was
true
enough
and
he
could
not
profess
himself
completely
displeased
he
nodded
well
then
you
have
to
stand
it
you
ca
avoid
it
it
ca
be
helped
and
there
one
more
thing
too
what
there
was
a
young
man
present
on
this
same
occasion
bingham
proceeded
a
decorative
diffusive
young
man
with
a
badge
richard
truesdale
marshall
was
that
his
name
any
son
of
yours
marshall
nodded
again
but
his
smile
was
distinctly
less
complacent
i
am
beginning
to
meet
his
name
in
print
quite
frequently
pursued
bingham
serenely
is
he
the
same
truesdale
marshall
who
has
a
collection
of
in
the
current
exhibition
at
the
art
institute
i
believe
so
responded
the
old
man
with
some
lack
of
warmth
is
it
the
same
truesdale
marshall
who
sang
last
friday
at
the
residence
of
granger
bates
for
the
benefit
of
of
david
marshall
smiled
broadly
our
jennie
what
a
girl
she
is
coming
to
be
that
lunch
club
is
one
of
her
pet
notions
she
pushes
it
at
all
times
in
season
and
out
she
seems
to
be
pushing
it
to
good
purpose
just
now
commented
bingham
i
suppose
she
is
the
same
miss
marshall
i
danced
with
last
night
she
sat
in
one
of
the
upper
places
so
to
speak
but
she
was
induced
to
go
down
on
the
floor
for
a
few
minutes
well
bingham
said
marshall
i
knew
you
went
to
that
sort
of
thing
once
in
a
while
and
i
thought
that
that
in
itself
was
a
good
deal
for
a
man
like
you
but
for
you
to
dance
there
i
should
have
imagined
your
doing
it
well
no
i
did
but
once
responded
the
other
apologetically
still
if
you
going
to
get
along
in
this
world
you
got
to
be
of
it
besides
i
thought
ad
that
she
was
entitled
to
show
that
dress
hers
was
described
too
um
said
her
father
soberly
with
a
sidelong
glance
towards
his
but
no
picture
well
let
that
pass
responded
bingham
with
a
slight
touch
of
pique
is
this
the
miss
marshall
who
read
lately
at
the
fortnightly
yes
is
it
the
same
one
who
is
announced
to
lecture
at
hull
house
on
the
russian
novelists
see
here
bingham
the
old
man
wheeled
about
sharply
in
his
chair
and
fastened
a
keen
scrutiny
upon
the
other
face
bingham
had
never
talked
to
him
like
this
before
he
had
never
seemed
so
so
slanted
towards
the
jocular
see
here
bingham
what
are
you
driving
at
bingham
fitted
himself
solidly
into
the
curved
back
of
the
chair
and
laid
his
hands
out
ponderously
upon
its
arms
he
had
something
to
say
and
he
wondered
how
best
he
might
say
it
marshall
is
twenty
years
older
than
i
am
he
thought
as
his
eye
traversed
the
shelves
of
nutmegs
and
and
lit
upon
the
discolored
awnings
over
the
way
and
i
must
be
careful
i
young
to
him
of
course
but
i
ca
ask
the
indulgence
due
to
a
boy
how
shall
i
work
it
he
felt
that
he
had
earned
the
right
to
speak
he
had
done
well
by
marshall
and
he
knew
that
marshall
was
pleased
it
was
more
as
a
personal
favor
than
anything
else
that
he
had
undertaken
the
work
upon
the
warehouse
he
had
put
it
through
more
promptly
than
anybody
else
could
have
done
and
with
less
interruption
to
the
course
of
trade
than
either
of
the
firm
would
have
imagined
possible
for
the
past
month
the
business
had
been
comfortably
accommodated
in
its
enlarged
quarters
and
the
two
new
floors
were
already
habituated
to
the
occult
processes
which
competition
and
a
minutely
graded
scale
of
prices
impose
upon
even
the
most
righteous
of
the
trade
it
is
but
fair
to
say
however
that
marshall
belden
always
saw
that
their
sugar
was
as
saccharine
as
a
specified
price
would
permit
and
that
their
met
the
lowered
standard
of
cheap
purchasers
as
well
as
the
apparatus
of
any
rival
did
yes
everything
was
running
smoothly
and
bingham
felt
that
he
might
venture
a
slight
trespass
upon
the
friendliness
and
tolerance
of
his
last
client
he
looked
at
marshall
for
a
moment
with
a
slow
and
cautious
smile
yes
the
young
people
are
holding
up
their
end
but
how
about
the
himself
oh
that
it
thought
marshall
he
made
an
instant
and
intuitive
application
of
this
remark
he
declining
towards
the
horizon
he
shining
but
dimly
compared
with
the
twinkling
of
his
attendant
satellites
well
the
man
is
altogether
useless
by
a
long
shot
the
young
people
dance
and
the
old
people
furnish
the
platform
see
here
bingham
i
do
have
to
go
to
the
papers
to
learn
what
my
daughters
wear
to
parties
i
got
my
own
papers
here
right
within
easy
reach
he
contracted
his
brows
as
his
eyes
turned
towards
the
a
better
account
too
than
the
newspaper
one
fuller
exacter
more
detailed
backed
up
by
figures
down
three
long
sheets
and
down
a
fourth
and
i
do
need
to
go
to
to
understand
what
opportunities
my
son
has
had
to
learn
to
paint
the
foreign
exchange
man
at
our
bank
could
tell
me
all
about
that
and
i
do
have
to
go
to
concerts
either
when
i
want
to
make
my
contribution
to
a
benevolent
object
i
can
sit
right
in
this
room
and
draw
checks
and
be
told
just
how
much
to
draw
them
for
too
yes
bingham
there
are
a
great
many
ways
for
an
old
fellow
like
me
to
make
himself
useful
and
i
am
not
allowed
to
overlook
any
of
them
marshall
tone
and
expression
during
this
exposition
had
wavered
back
and
forth
between
jest
and
protest
but
his
eyes
wandered
towards
those
again
and
his
mien
and
accents
drew
on
a
shade
of
distinct
melancholy
these
receptacles
contained
other
bills
than
those
of
the
there
was
one
for
example
from
a
and
another
from
a
for
rosamund
at
the
very
outset
of
her
career
had
set
her
face
against
old
mabel
and
the
she
declined
to
appear
in
any
such
fashion
among
the
landaus
and
broughams
of
her
associates
she
represented
furthermore
that
it
was
extremely
awkward
to
depend
upon
the
equipages
of
friends
and
she
protested
that
it
was
far
beneath
their
dignity
to
hire
a
conveyance
from
a
her
father
had
succumbed
along
with
the
bills
for
the
new
carriage
and
pair
were
bills
for
a
coachman
hat
and
besides
these
there
was
the
first
month
statement
of
board
for
mabel
and
storage
for
the
both
having
been
crowded
out
of
the
cramped
stable
to
another
across
the
alley
yes
resumed
bingham
availing
himself
of
marshall
own
figure
the
young
people
are
dancing
though
no
more
briskly
than
they
should
but
why
may
not
the
old
people
dance
too
when
the
young
ones
are
making
their
youth
and
their
beauty
and
their
cleverness
tell
as
they
do
may
they
not
the
old
ones
to
come
forward
as
well
are
there
times
when
they
should
do
it
in
mere
justice
to
themselves
after
your
children
have
led
so
many
more
germans
and
adorned
so
many
more
receptions
and
founded
so
many
more
clubs
and
really
worked
their
way
into
the
life
of
the
town
they
may
look
to
their
father
to
put
himself
in
evidence
also
one
of
them
i
can
swear
is
already
a
little
jealous
on
your
account
jane
oh
yes
she
is
always
trying
to
make
her
poor
old
father
toe
the
mark
she
has
plans
for
you
ambitions
for
you
if
you
meet
the
expectations
that
the
future
is
likely
to
develop
you
will
be
carrying
through
a
pretty
big
contract
i
was
surprised
myself
to
learn
how
many
diverse
opportunities
this
town
offers
enough
to
extend
through
three
dances
people
may
preside
at
banquets
i
learned
and
address
political
meetings
and
head
subscription
papers
and
found
public
baths
and
build
and
endow
colleges
and
there
are
others
who
donate
telescopes
or
erect
model
or
set
up
statues
and
fountains
or
give
marshall
he
said
suddenly
do
something
for
yourself
and
for
the
town
nothing
that
you
are
doing
here
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
larger
office
outside
is
enough
for
a
man
of
your
means
and
standing
bingham
was
now
speaking
with
increased
confidence
and
with
greater
seriousness
he
felt
himself
entitled
to
say
these
things
by
reason
of
their
personal
relations
and
by
virtue
of
his
own
standing
before
the
public
he
was
twenty
years
younger
than
marshall
but
he
was
twenty
times
as
great
a
figure
in
the
public
eye
he
had
had
no
mean
share
in
those
two
fast
and
crowded
years
through
which
the
city
had
striven
towards
readiness
for
the
coming
of
the
world
like
the
christians
at
ephesus
he
too
had
fought
with
the
wild
beasts
with
time
with
the
elements
with
labor
with
national
niggardliness
with
a
management
and
he
had
expanded
and
ripened
in
the
struggle
he
saw
the
world
with
a
wider
vision
he
inhaled
the
vast
and
palpitating
present
with
a
deeper
breath
he
beheld
too
a
triumphant
and
future
and
he
felt
with
the
utmost
keenness
the
opportunities
that
the
town
offered
even
to
the
older
and
departing
generation
crabbed
and
reluctant
though
it
be
marshall
listened
to
his
remarks
and
indicated
an
unremitted
attention
by
bowing
now
and
then
with
a
subdued
gravity
the
strain
seemed
familiar
where
had
he
heard
it
before
why
from
susan
bates
to
be
sure
and
in
this
very
place
strophe
and
antistrophe
could
it
be
possible
that
he
was
so
remiss
towards
himself
and
towards
the
community
could
it
be
true
that
he
was
doing
himself
such
scant
and
graceless
justice
what
answer
had
he
to
make
to
this
new
advocate
the
old
one
with
additions
i
have
been
thinking
about
these
matters
i
have
been
considering
the
public
that
so
much
is
asked
for
it
is
not
the
old
public
i
used
to
know
twenty
years
ago
it
has
changed
a
good
deal
it
is
better
organized
against
us
a
banding
together
of
petty
officials
with
their
whole
contemptible
following
that
have
left
their
noisome
holds
to
swarm
into
our
houses
over
them
through
them
everywhere
between
the
floors
behind
the
wainscoting
everywhere
do
you
know
anything
about
cheap
law
justice
courts
do
let
go
into
that
said
bingham
quickly
i
in
that
retorted
marshall
angrily
his
blue
eyes
took
on
an
unwonted
gleam
and
i
shall
stay
in
until
i
have
satisfied
myself
drop
it
said
bingham
it
a
terrible
thing
rotten
deplorable
an
curse
i
will
not
returned
marshall
he
struck
his
thin
old
hand
on
the
edge
of
his
desk
i
see
it
through
they
live
within
two
blocks
of
my
house
her
son
is
an
alderman
her
nephew
is
a
bailiff
two
or
three
others
of
them
keep
saloons
they
are
poles
or
bohemians
or
jews
heaven
knows
what
they
do
business
on
the
premises
they
stick
to
their
burrow
yet
we
could
get
a
summons
served
by
a
constable
and
when
we
finally
got
the
matter
before
a
court
it
was
continued
no
defendants
there
only
a
filthy
little
creature
who
called
himself
their
attorney
we
were
never
so
blackguarded
in
our
lives
then
another
continuance
and
a
third
roger
poor
boy
makes
no
headway
at
all
he
knows
the
law
he
has
a
good
practice
he
leases
and
collects
for
me
and
buys
and
sells
but
he
is
getting
to
be
almost
ashamed
to
come
here
to
see
me
about
it
i
know
assented
bingham
a
kind
of
get
a
shyster
fight
the
devil
with
fire
what
can
a
gentleman
do
in
a
justice
court
if
the
rats
are
behind
the
wainscot
do
stick
your
own
hand
into
the
hole
hire
somebody
else
i
wo
cried
the
old
man
stubbornly
i
want
to
see
for
myself
how
things
actually
are
i
want
to
learn
what
conditions
we
are
living
under
i
want
to
understand
the
things
that
are
really
going
on
about
us
i
want
to
see
what
a
good
citizen
and
a
can
count
upon
by
way
of
redress
he
picked
at
his
petty
grievance
as
a
child
torments
a
sore
yet
a
sore
in
justice
may
mean
little
or
it
may
mean
much
any
physician
will
tell
you
that
drop
it
counselled
bingham
again
it
will
irritate
you
and
exasperate
you
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
importance
and
if
you
have
been
wronged
in
a
lower
court
remember
that
many
poorer
men
have
been
wronged
in
higher
ones
come
keep
your
head
clear
and
your
temper
calm
and
save
them
for
important
things
the
door
of
the
little
office
opened
softly
and
one
of
the
important
things
began
the
door
had
opened
none
too
widely
yet
sufficiently
for
the
entrance
of
the
thin
edge
of
a
wedge
a
wedge
that
was
to
gain
a
tyrannizing
force
with
each
inch
of
advance
as
is
the
wont
to
bingham
it
seemed
like
another
of
those
rats
one
that
had
left
the
wainscoting
and
taken
to
the
floor
regardless
in
a
boldness
at
once
insolent
and
sly
of
the
presence
of
humankind
to
marshall
it
was
only
an
from
the
outer
room
who
now
entered
with
a
handful
of
mail
matter
which
he
placed
with
an
air
not
wholly
guiltless
of
servility
and
stealth
upon
his
employer
desk
he
was
a
dark
man
of
with
a
black
beard
and
a
pair
of
narrow
eyes
he
looked
neither
of
the
two
occupants
of
the
room
full
in
the
face
his
glance
was
searching
and
sidelong
rather
not
so
much
from
the
presence
of
anything
to
spy
upon
as
from
habit
and
instinct
one
fancied
a
man
too
accustomed
to
the
heavy
foot
of
superiors
to
decline
willingly
any
minor
advantage
that
came
his
way
or
any
major
one
bingham
eyes
followed
him
out
whom
have
you
there
somebody
of
belden
a
new
hand
some
of
the
sediment
left
from
the
fair
that
where
i
seen
him
he
was
in
the
service
building
draughtsman
clerk
or
something
swiss
alsacian
i
do
know
replied
marshall
he
speaks
german
and
some
french
half
unconsciously
he
began
upon
his
mail
it
would
be
more
to
the
purpose
if
he
spoke
english
better
bingham
reached
for
his
hat
well
time
money
to
both
of
us
english
is
an
easy
thing
to
pick
up
as
witness
midway
i
dare
say
he
be
able
to
express
himself
fluently
enough
inside
of
another
six
months
xi
there
jane
had
said
to
herself
as
he
stood
before
her
small
to
give
a
final
touch
to
her
hair
and
to
pull
out
her
puffed
sleeves
to
their
widest
for
the
tenth
and
last
time
if
i
can
keep
in
mind
that
i
am
years
old
and
not
a
day
less
i
imagine
i
shall
get
through
all
right
of
course
i
go
on
the
floor
and
dance
at
least
not
very
much
perhaps
nobody
will
ask
me
anyway
of
course
i
can
expect
nothing
from
theodore
brower
who
waltz
any
more
than
he
could
fly
no
i
just
sit
in
the
box
and
then
nobody
can
say
that
i
am
giddy
or
flighty
or
trying
to
be
too
young
she
cast
a
last
glance
towards
her
which
seemed
smaller
than
ever
i
do
wish
i
could
see
both
of
them
at
once
i
hope
theodore
will
like
the
chances
are
though
he
never
notice
at
all
such
had
been
jane
modest
and
cautious
programme
and
she
carried
it
out
pretty
closely
she
sat
in
the
box
with
bates
a
good
part
of
the
evening
and
bowed
a
great
many
times
to
a
great
many
gentlemen
young
and
old
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
and
never
expected
to
see
again
and
whose
names
therefore
she
made
no
effort
to
secure
she
talked
with
two
or
three
with
whom
it
seemed
possible
and
profitable
to
talk
and
learned
their
names
afterwards
bates
himself
spent
very
little
time
in
his
wife
box
he
lounged
on
one
of
the
springy
sofas
in
the
narrow
lobby
behind
or
leaned
over
the
burnished
barriers
of
other
boxes
to
talk
murmurously
with
other
magnates
about
the
stock
exchange
or
the
volume
of
traffic
he
was
a
grave
and
somewhat
inexpressive
person
with
reticent
eyes
and
bunches
of
and
a
rather
cold
and
impassive
manner
his
wife
followed
his
peregrinations
with
an
indulgent
eye
poor
granger
she
said
to
jane
this
thing
tires
him
more
and
more
every
year
so
i
give
him
plenty
of
leeway
see
him
now
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
where
twenty
feet
away
her
husband
was
talking
across
the
bronze
bar
with
another
elderly
man
in
the
adjoining
box
it
a
conference
she
went
on
it
a
deal
it
on
my
account
he
told
me
so
himself
if
it
goes
through
it
means
another
string
to
this
necklace
she
suddenly
became
quite
smileless
and
rigid
why
what
the
matter
asked
jane
bates
presently
relaxed
that
woman
who
just
passed
she
explained
she
was
wondering
if
these
diamonds
were
imitations
and
the
real
ones
in
the
safety
vaults
notice
that
other
one
over
there
yes
the
one
in
with
the
garnet
velvet
sleeves
looking
for
me
and
ca
find
me
there
she
sees
granger
everybody
knows
and
now
she
quieter
she
satisfied
she
has
taken
old
mcintosh
for
me
just
because
granger
happens
to
be
in
their
box
for
a
moment
see
the
man
alongside
of
her
is
smiling
and
looking
the
same
way
i
know
what
she
saying
to
him
bates
that
plain
old
woman
in
that
dowdy
gown
well
i
never
after
all
i
heard
and
read
and
she
so
happy
over
it
tell
me
child
i
plain
i
dowdy
you
are
magnificent
said
jane
squeezing
her
hand
is
only
a
dauber
and
a
one
at
that
jane
after
the
first
had
become
quite
habituated
to
her
new
and
unaccustomed
environment
her
attitude
was
neither
too
nor
too
relaxed
and
she
never
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
she
was
her
dress
was
a
fabric
in
a
soft
shade
of
run
through
by
fine
black
lines
her
ample
sleeves
took
full
advantage
of
the
prevailing
mode
and
several
falls
of
wide
lace
passed
between
them
both
before
and
behind
her
hair
was
done
up
high
in
a
fashion
devised
by
her
fairy
godmother
a
piece
of
discreet
but
fetching
phantasy
jane
leaned
back
graciously
in
her
chair
after
the
manner
of
her
favorite
heroines
losing
in
height
and
gaining
in
breadth
never
before
had
she
felt
so
amplitudinous
so
imperial
whoever
would
suspect
she
asked
turning
over
her
shoulder
to
susan
bates
that
i
was
a
rail
nobody
the
other
responded
you
never
looked
so
well
in
your
life
jane
blushed
with
pleasure
at
that
moment
two
of
the
fortnightly
ladies
passed
clever
creatures
who
could
drive
culture
and
society
abreast
jane
with
the
flush
still
on
her
face
and
a
happy
glitter
in
those
wide
eyes
leaned
forward
and
bowed
in
the
most
marked
style
at
her
command
i
am
here
myself
she
seemed
to
announce
well
said
one
of
the
fortnightly
ladies
where
is
the
now
ah
smiled
the
other
that
past
and
the
is
here
again
however
jane
was
not
so
taken
up
with
her
literary
affinities
as
to
lose
sight
of
her
own
kith
and
kin
she
saw
rosy
swim
past
once
or
twice
and
was
gratified
by
constant
glimpses
of
an
active
and
radiant
truesdale
once
statira
belden
drove
by
in
saffron
satin
and
a
tiara
and
that
her
daughter
with
her
commented
jane
and
that
girl
from
new
york
and
there
goes
her
son
that
little
snip
huh
compare
him
with
our
truesdale
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
as
her
brother
came
once
more
into
view
yes
she
said
his
flower
is
all
right
and
the
soles
of
his
shoes
i
wonder
if
and
she
leaned
still
farther
forward
and
drew
in
a
long
breath
through
her
nose
no
i
ca
smell
it
i
do
believe
bothered
him
any
jane
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
had
sent
truesdale
to
the
ball
as
a
lady
sends
a
knight
to
battle
she
had
stopped
him
on
the
moment
of
his
departure
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
close
to
the
grotesque
old
to
look
him
over
with
a
severely
critical
eye
has
it
got
its
posy
in
its
she
inquired
throwing
open
his
ulster
there
was
a
gardenia
there
yes
all
right
then
has
it
got
its
little
soles
blacked
truesdale
laughed
and
turned
up
one
of
his
long
slender
shining
shoes
while
he
supported
himself
by
his
other
leg
and
the
yes
that
she
assented
what
else
is
there
now
she
pondered
oh
wait
one
second
she
ravaged
his
inner
pocket
with
a
sudden
hand
has
it
got
its
on
its
little
hanky
she
drew
out
the
handkerchief
and
clapped
it
to
her
nose
not
a
drop
just
wait
one
second
she
tore
in
great
haste
and
in
a
moment
more
she
came
tumbling
down
with
her
own
cologne
bottle
in
her
hand
you
kill
yourself
jane
her
mother
called
here
she
seized
her
brother
handkerchief
again
and
drenched
it
with
a
plentiful
and
vigorous
douse
there
she
said
with
great
satisfaction
as
she
restored
it
to
him
goodness
jane
truesdale
cried
in
laughing
protest
they
all
smell
this
for
fifty
feet
around
jane
gave
her
brother
a
commendatory
pat
and
said
no
word
she
felt
that
he
was
now
ready
for
conquest
speech
was
superfluous
no
i
ca
smell
it
said
jane
again
i
think
he
must
have
exaggerated
he
going
off
in
the
other
direction
anyway
bates
touched
her
elbow
who
that
dark
girl
in
pink
no
not
to
the
left
straight
ahead
why
i
declare
it
rosy
exclaimed
jane
and
does
she
look
lovely
she
the
prettiest
girl
here
is
she
yes
and
how
well
that
little
curl
on
her
forehead
keeps
its
shape
but
do
you
think
she
should
have
worn
mar√©chal
niels
i
dare
say
she
had
red
until
she
is
tired
of
them
who
is
the
young
man
with
her
do
know
said
jane
these
new
young
men
are
getting
to
be
too
many
for
well
then
i
tell
you
it
arthur
paston
arthur
asked
jane
contributing
a
conscientious
hyphen
to
the
name
and
a
laborious
accent
to
the
forepart
of
it
why
he
look
so
very
hateful
and
supercilious
oh
he
never
that
he
a
nice
enough
fellow
you
must
take
all
my
exaggerations
seriously
he
jolly
and
pleasant
as
you
see
for
yourself
he
better
be
with
rosamund
she
wo
stand
any
great
and
little
from
anybody
but
he
does
look
real
nice
and
stout
and
healthy
and
rosy
and
everything
does
he
especially
rosy
said
bates
wickedly
i
ashamed
of
you
remonstrated
jane
and
the
two
young
people
swept
on
while
the
music
swirled
and
crashed
and
the
vast
illumined
ceiling
bent
above
them
like
a
rainbow
of
promise
during
one
of
the
promenades
truesdale
passed
by
with
bertie
patterson
on
his
arm
the
decorum
of
the
walk
could
not
exclude
all
of
lithe
and
swaying
ease
he
held
his
head
high
and
sent
his
eyes
abroad
to
right
or
left
with
an
assurance
that
some
might
have
felt
to
be
an
impertinence
and
others
an
insolence
to
jane
he
seemed
just
descended
from
some
hill
she
sniffed
once
or
twice
as
he
went
past
i
i
did
put
too
much
on
i
sure
i
did
i
just
worry
about
it
any
more
bertie
patterson
kept
step
beside
him
bravely
though
she
knew
that
jane
was
looking
at
her
from
one
side
of
the
house
and
her
aunt
lydia
from
the
other
she
was
striving
faithfully
to
be
worthy
of
her
environment
to
take
the
arm
of
this
brilliant
young
personage
on
any
occasion
at
all
would
have
been
a
test
of
spirit
how
much
more
so
on
an
occasion
so
brilliant
and
entrancing
as
this
particularly
when
the
badge
upon
the
young
man
breast
connected
him
so
closely
with
it
and
made
the
connection
patent
to
all
she
fused
everything
and
filled
him
with
it
and
it
with
him
the
mounting
tones
of
violins
and
trumpets
the
sparkling
quincunxes
of
the
girdling
the
wide
band
of
fresco
which
ran
in
unison
with
the
arches
of
glittering
bulbs
above
their
heads
the
circling
and
swaying
throng
all
the
sheen
and
splendor
of
a
vast
and
successful
city
nice
little
girl
with
your
brother
said
bates
a
real
dear
responded
jane
she
poured
tea
for
rosy
did
she
indeed
and
bates
looked
at
her
harder
to
avoid
seeing
the
passage
of
gilbert
belden
and
his
wife
there
another
real
dear
she
said
presently
if
i
can
only
catch
his
eye
she
held
up
her
finger
to
a
young
man
who
had
just
conducted
rosamund
back
to
her
aunt
lydia
box
rosy
had
quite
scorned
the
antiquated
usage
of
the
balls
of
an
earlier
and
less
sophisticated
day
of
i
shall
not
go
with
any
young
man
i
shall
go
with
a
chaperon
and
if
the
young
men
wish
to
see
me
they
may
see
me
there
all
right
if
jane
wants
to
go
with
theodore
brower
they
might
do
anything
after
the
way
they
bang
around
together
in
the
and
i
go
even
with
a
chaperon
unless
she
is
in
a
box
where
i
can
be
taken
afterwards
a
declaration
which
led
to
financial
negotiations
between
david
marshall
and
his
and
which
brought
him
to
a
still
higher
appreciation
of
the
general
preciousness
of
his
youngest
daughter
there
he
coming
my
boy
billy
is
he
about
right
a
tall
young
man
of
was
making
his
way
across
the
floor
and
presently
passed
through
the
exit
in
the
midst
of
the
lower
boxes
to
gain
the
level
of
the
upper
ones
college
all
over
is
he
commented
jane
his
shoulders
and
the
way
he
parts
his
hair
the
best
boy
in
the
world
said
bates
plumply
he
has
been
with
his
father
for
the
last
four
years
and
he
come
to
be
a
real
help
to
him
gets
to
the
office
at
eight
rain
or
shine
and
loves
nothing
better
than
to
sit
and
grub
there
all
day
long
steady
as
a
rock
splendid
future
holds
his
own
nose
to
the
grindstone
like
a
real
little
lamb
i
hope
he
asked
rosamund
for
supper
the
young
man
presently
reappeared
making
his
way
behind
the
long
tier
of
upper
boxes
well
my
boy
were
you
forgetting
all
about
your
mother
and
her
elderly
friends
i
never
figured
on
your
meeting
the
younger
daughter
first
my
son
william
miss
marshall
william
here
an
awfully
good
girl
her
father
thinks
as
much
of
her
as
i
do
of
you
the
young
man
bowed
but
blushed
and
halted
before
this
singular
presentation
well
i
do
know
said
jane
filling
up
the
breach
in
the
first
fashion
that
presented
itself
if
pa
had
the
same
gift
of
language
that
you
have
i
should
feel
surer
she
picked
out
her
puffs
and
then
leaned
back
negligently
with
her
hands
crossed
she
was
too
thoroughly
grounded
by
this
time
to
be
discomposed
by
any
youth
seven
or
eight
years
her
junior
the
youth
shifted
his
feet
i
saw
you
with
my
sister
a
minute
ago
continued
jane
she
knew
without
looking
round
to
see
that
bates
was
smiling
in
the
anxious
way
of
parents
who
have
put
their
offspring
at
a
disadvantage
yes
oh
yes
the
young
man
responded
with
precipitation
we
had
a
very
nice
polka
indeed
well
said
jane
to
herself
i
can
talk
about
polkas
and
lots
of
other
things
and
she
did
she
held
and
entertained
the
young
man
for
a
full
ten
minutes
she
found
after
all
that
he
was
in
no
degree
constrained
or
backward
and
she
made
him
do
himself
justice
well
my
dear
said
bates
as
he
withdrew
you
made
my
billy
quite
brilliant
i
do
know
when
i
have
heard
so
much
real
conversation
that
all
right
responded
jane
i
was
young
myself
once
i
forgotten
that
only
you
must
fascinate
him
protested
the
elder
woman
with
a
burlesque
of
maternal
anxiety
i
want
somebody
else
to
do
she
gave
jane
a
smile
full
of
meaning
aha
thought
jane
and
wondered
if
she
were
to
see
a
certain
little
romance
resumed
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
lumbering
years
but
she
did
seem
to
mind
paston
any
well
why
should
she
concluded
jane
presently
truesdale
came
along
and
asked
his
sister
to
waltz
all
right
she
said
just
for
a
minute
but
not
out
in
the
middle
yet
she
wished
to
test
herself
first
you
awfully
good
to
me
dicky
she
whispered
as
he
led
her
back
cut
it
said
truesdale
i
proud
of
you
jane
got
back
to
her
lofty
perch
i
do
it
once
more
if
anybody
asks
me
yes
i
will
in
another
ten
minutes
she
was
on
the
floor
again
quite
happy
sure
she
had
said
to
bingham
only
i
no
great
dancer
this
big
and
bearded
bachelor
had
warned
her
neither
am
i
declared
jane
i
can
just
totter
around
and
that
about
all
she
arose
quickly
shook
out
her
plumage
took
his
arm
and
in
less
than
a
minute
was
waltzing
again
lucky
it
a
waltz
she
thought
i
do
want
to
be
trying
too
many
novelties
bates
moved
to
let
them
pass
out
really
she
said
i
do
want
to
sit
here
all
alone
oh
brower
i
rely
upon
you
let
me
have
your
arm
i
suppose
with
a
resigned
submission
to
the
inevitable
that
i
am
expected
to
walk
around
once
at
least
brower
had
returned
to
the
box
after
diverting
himself
for
some
time
rather
shyly
in
the
foyer
he
had
given
jane
a
promenade
earlier
in
the
evening
and
had
hoped
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
time
as
inconspicuously
as
might
be
jane
had
been
much
pleased
by
his
efforts
to
do
the
right
thing
to
be
correctly
dressed
for
example
she
knew
from
her
own
experience
how
one
thing
led
to
another
and
she
was
appreciative
of
the
pains
he
had
taken
on
her
account
it
was
easy
for
her
to
fancy
how
must
lead
to
and
shirts
to
studs
and
collars
and
ties
and
shoes
and
boutonni√®res
but
brower
wore
no
boutonni√®re
there
he
drew
the
line
never
mind
said
jane
that
is
necessary
anyway
he
has
done
quite
enough
as
it
is
and
he
a
good
fellow
to
have
done
it
she
knew
how
he
regarded
all
this
as
a
sacrifice
to
mammon
if
not
indeed
to
moloch
on
my
account
too
thought
jane
every
bit
of
it
is
it
splendid
of
him
brower
was
vastly
disconcerted
on
receiving
this
command
from
bates
it
was
nothing
less
than
a
command
of
course
and
he
must
obey
it
he
had
found
it
something
of
an
ordeal
to
lead
even
jane
round
the
floor
once
how
much
greater
a
one
then
to
perform
the
like
service
for
granger
bates
whose
escort
could
not
but
expect
to
draw
scrutiny
and
to
provoke
inquiry
he
was
a
modest
man
with
no
pronounced
social
ambitions
he
would
immensely
have
preferred
to
pass
the
same
length
of
time
staring
into
a
locomotive
bates
presently
effected
a
clearance
and
with
brower
as
a
convoy
steered
straight
for
the
open
sea
she
carried
a
bunch
of
plumes
aloft
showed
a
flashing
brilliant
on
both
the
port
and
the
starboard
side
and
left
a
long
trail
of
rustling
silk
and
lace
behind
her
and
as
she
pursued
her
course
other
craft
great
and
small
dipped
their
colors
right
and
left
i
want
you
to
see
both
ends
of
the
scale
she
presently
said
to
brower
you
are
trying
to
bring
them
closer
together
they
tell
me
that
is
a
part
of
our
object
replied
brower
well
you
have
one
end
in
your
nineteenth
ward
and
the
other
here
i
want
you
to
get
the
good
side
of
this
i
should
be
glad
to
there
one
i
sure
to
begin
with
do
encourage
your
associates
to
talk
about
the
of
fashion
and
that
sort
of
thing
there
are
no
butterflies
in
this
town
except
young
girls
under
twenty
and
you
surely
wo
quarrel
with
yes
we
are
all
workers
what
could
idleness
herself
do
with
her
time
in
such
a
place
as
this
you
got
to
work
in
do
you
see
that
woman
up
aloft
there
well
she
the
president
and
responsible
manager
of
an
orphan
asylum
that
one
over
across
on
the
other
side
is
an
officer
of
the
civil
federation
do
you
believe
in
that
devoutly
the
woman
just
ahead
of
us
the
purple
velvet
one
is
a
member
of
the
board
of
education
she
helps
to
place
teachers
and
to
audit
coal
bills
why
even
i
myself
have
got
a
good
many
more
things
to
look
after
than
you
could
easily
shake
a
stick
at
and
the
one
you
this
instant
bowed
to
you
mean
the
one
who
bowed
to
me
for
rhodes
had
leaned
completely
out
of
her
box
and
had
then
looked
both
right
and
left
to
observe
whether
her
neighbors
had
done
full
justice
to
the
episode
oh
she
a
good
little
woman
who
is
climbing
the
fact
is
bates
proceeded
that
there
are
not
a
dozen
real
butterflies
in
town
we
coming
to
one
now
they
were
skirting
one
range
of
the
lower
boxes
it
ingles
you
must
meet
her
some
other
time
please
implored
brower
as
bates
nodded
to
a
sumptuous
young
creature
not
ten
feet
away
very
well
bates
shrugged
her
shoulders
yes
she
proceeded
presently
cecilia
ingles
and
her
immediate
set
are
about
the
only
real
butterflies
we
have
however
i
going
to
take
her
in
hand
pretty
soon
and
make
a
good
earnest
woman
of
her
there
is
work
for
them
all
said
brower
but
do
let
be
too
serious
just
now
rejoined
bates
in
friendly
caution
who
was
that
young
man
you
had
with
you
last
night
somebody
demanded
of
her
next
day
mr
brower
who
is
brower
may
i
ask
a
friend
of
jane
marshall
this
save
that
he
had
a
trusty
face
was
all
that
she
knew
of
theodore
brower
but
she
thought
it
enough
and
who
is
jane
marshall
bates
gave
her
questioner
one
look
really
you
surprise
me
she
observed
and
said
no
word
more
within
a
week
jane
was
known
throughout
the
inquirer
whole
set
truesdale
presently
passed
bates
with
a
girl
on
his
arm
i
wonder
if
that
another
one
of
the
she
asked
herself
it
was
truesdale
was
escorting
gladys
gladys
mckenna
as
her
complete
name
had
finally
come
to
him
he
had
laughed
on
first
hearing
it
there
a
for
you
sure
enough
gladys
wore
a
gown
and
her
eyes
curiously
fringed
with
black
above
and
beneath
had
an
and
dishevelled
appearance
that
lingered
in
the
memory
as
do
she
kept
a
strong
clutch
on
his
arm
and
galloped
alongside
him
with
a
persistent
which
conveyed
no
hint
of
cessation
why
insist
so
strongly
on
a
he
was
asking
her
was
a
march
good
enough
we
always
look
for
a
quadrille
at
one
of
the
best
functions
at
home
but
why
draw
lines
you
do
object
if
people
meet
for
pleasure
on
terms
free
and
equal
oh
of
course
if
you
have
no
celebrities
here
no
great
figures
not
one
not
till
you
came
we
are
all
plain
people
here
if
any
of
us
forget
our
plainness
there
are
plenty
who
are
glad
enough
to
remind
us
of
it
are
you
plain
too
the
plainest
of
the
lot
you
do
seem
so
you
look
awfully
ornamental
with
that
ribbon
and
all
the
all
meant
the
wave
in
his
hair
the
lustre
of
his
eyes
the
upward
flaunt
of
his
mustache
which
hid
in
no
degree
the
white
firm
evenness
of
his
teeth
the
freshness
of
a
second
gardenia
even
the
sheen
of
his
shapely
shoes
the
ribbon
you
like
it
sorry
i
wearing
only
one
how
would
you
have
liked
a
second
running
the
opposite
way
or
a
third
pinned
on
behind
oh
you
how
about
all
these
other
young
men
are
they
anybody
what
other
young
men
the
ones
with
these
red
ribbons
oh
well
some
few
of
them
have
what
you
might
call
position
and
some
are
working
for
it
and
some
are
not
thinking
anything
about
it
and
some
after
having
served
their
purpose
will
be
dropped
soon
enough
i
promise
you
and
you
yourself
are
you
in
or
out
or
not
thinking
about
it
i
returned
truesdale
carelessly
i
just
a
i
on
my
way
to
japan
oh
no
not
japan
said
the
girl
quickly
japan
i
assure
you
he
smiled
she
caught
herself
to
escape
my
uncle
then
why
that
in
heaven
name
you
have
offended
him
dear
me
how
by
what
you
said
at
the
house
the
other
night
about
the
costumes
you
know
nonsense
how
could
that
have
reached
him
those
things
do
get
around
do
you
know
what
he
going
to
do
going
to
cut
your
comb
my
aunt
she
cried
like
anything
to
truesdale
the
girl
tone
seemed
preposterously
confidential
you
were
in
the
wrong
she
seemed
to
imply
but
i
am
on
your
side
for
all
that
ouf
said
truesdale
this
comes
of
trenching
on
biblical
ground
never
quote
scripture
again
truesdale
had
gone
to
the
belden
house
in
pursuance
of
the
invitation
extended
at
his
mother
own
eliza
marshall
had
made
a
faint
effort
to
dissuade
him
despite
belden
presence
at
her
own
function
his
going
seemed
in
one
way
or
another
too
much
like
an
excursion
into
the
enemy
country
but
the
occasion
was
a
ball
and
truesdale
declared
himself
much
too
curious
to
remain
away
i
must
go
he
said
and
at
once
took
steps
to
equip
himself
for
this
voyage
of
discovery
he
wore
the
dress
of
a
spanish
grandee
of
the
early
seventeenth
century
he
recalled
the
spaniards
as
famous
explorers
he
was
in
black
throughout
save
for
the
white
lace
of
his
wide
collar
and
cuffs
and
for
the
dark
purple
lining
of
his
mantle
if
the
beldens
for
their
part
had
costumed
themselves
half
so
discreetly
he
would
never
have
fallen
from
their
good
graces
but
statira
belden
keeping
her
own
given
name
in
view
had
based
her
costume
upon
one
of
the
old
french
tapestries
the
family
of
darius
at
the
feet
of
alexander
you
may
see
the
original
a
veronese
in
the
national
gallery
she
had
counterfeited
the
distressed
queen
by
flowing
robes
and
pearls
strung
through
her
yellow
hair
she
had
revivified
and
heightened
the
faded
ideal
of
the
oldtime
artist
and
incidentally
she
had
extinguished
every
other
woman
in
the
room
but
the
difficulty
would
still
have
been
avoided
had
not
belden
himself
so
far
lapsed
from
discretion
as
to
put
himself
forward
in
the
guise
of
shylock
it
mended
matters
little
that
he
had
abandoned
the
costume
within
half
an
hour
after
donning
it
thus
it
was
that
truesdale
saw
him
for
the
first
time
in
four
or
five
years
the
young
man
had
completely
disdained
thus
far
to
visit
the
store
with
eyes
freshened
by
long
absence
and
wits
sharpened
by
contact
with
the
world
he
saw
his
father
partner
in
a
dress
which
seemed
to
throw
into
greater
prominence
every
lineament
of
his
face
and
every
trait
of
his
character
the
young
man
instantly
doubted
mistrusted
him
his
hebraic
garments
suggested
another
character
held
in
still
lower
esteem
truesdale
at
a
certain
stage
of
the
entertainment
observed
his
host
and
hostess
in
momentary
conjunction
on
the
threshold
of
the
it
was
then
that
he
uttered
his
little
jest
whimsically
careless
of
accuracy
and
loftily
indifferent
to
outlying
ears
ananias
and
statira
he
said
and
his
words
travelled
through
the
house
like
escaping
gas
they
awfully
offended
said
gladys
continuing
her
confidential
tone
you
ca
come
there
any
more
i
do
believe
i
so
glad
to
have
seen
you
here
who
knows
where
i
shall
ever
see
you
again
why
would
you
talk
to
me
any
that
first
time
why
were
you
so
long
in
asking
me
to
dance
she
seemed
to
be
pushing
the
claim
of
proprietorship
first
advanced
at
the
belden
ball
well
i
hope
i
talked
enough
since
but
where
shall
we
talk
together
next
time
i
do
believe
you
can
come
to
the
house
she
repeated
she
seemed
to
be
drawing
attention
romantically
to
obstacles
in
the
way
in
their
way
and
to
be
calling
on
him
to
remove
them
perhaps
they
wo
let
me
see
you
again
perhaps
they
offended
by
my
having
danced
with
you
here
she
was
adding
to
the
barricade
but
he
was
bold
and
resourceful
enough
to
level
it
ouf
thought
truesdale
girls
they
alike
every
one
of
after
all
xii
it
was
two
in
the
morning
when
jane
said
to
theodore
brower
in
the
vestibule
and
burst
into
the
house
there
was
a
light
burning
in
the
library
and
thitherward
jane
swept
in
high
feather
her
father
was
sitting
there
as
she
entered
he
took
up
a
newspaper
that
he
had
completely
read
out
three
hours
before
why
poppy
she
cried
is
this
pretty
late
for
you
but
i
know
what
you
been
sitting
up
for
so
long
to
have
me
tell
you
all
about
the
party
now
have
you
her
father
looked
up
at
her
in
some
wonder
jane
was
distinctly
in
a
state
of
exhilaration
she
seemed
conscious
of
having
played
well
her
part
no
mean
part
either
in
a
large
performance
one
might
have
fancied
indeed
that
the
splendor
and
success
of
the
occasion
was
in
some
degree
due
to
her
own
participation
she
was
decidedly
gay
bright
sparkling
her
father
felt
that
here
at
last
was
his
daughter
almost
pretty
maybe
i
was
he
answered
he
threw
down
the
newspaper
so
as
to
make
it
cover
several
loose
sheets
full
of
figures
did
you
enjoy
yourself
i
should
say
i
did
she
seated
herself
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
one
of
her
big
puffed
sleeves
almost
covered
his
face
do
think
i
was
a
wallflower
either
i
was
i
went
out
on
the
floor
three
times
brower
walked
me
around
once
and
bingham
waltzed
with
me
once
and
so
did
truedy
oh
poppy
he
was
so
good
to
me
and
he
was
the
only
young
man
there
with
violet
eyes
i
did
see
another
one
her
father
gave
vent
to
a
low
inarticulate
monosyllable
it
seemed
to
convey
little
appreciation
of
his
son
eyes
jane
had
met
truesdale
for
a
moment
just
before
she
came
away
how
the
handkerchief
she
had
asked
all
right
he
responded
cheerfully
he
took
it
folded
and
crumpled
from
his
and
showed
it
to
her
he
had
carried
it
in
his
trousers
pocket
until
a
moment
before
but
jane
never
knew
and
i
went
to
supper
with
bates
and
theo
brower
she
continued
and
the
oldest
bates
boy
took
rosy
we
all
went
up
in
the
elevator
together
and
had
a
table
quite
to
ourselves
i
saw
bates
there
too
and
lots
of
other
elderly
gentlemen
i
wish
had
been
there
several
of
them
made
themselves
prominent
enough
no
younger
than
you
no
richer
no
more
deserving
of
notice
poppy
you
must
get
out
that
coat
some
time
and
brush
it
up
and
go
somewhere
with
marshall
thrust
a
finger
under
the
edge
of
the
newspaper
i
do
know
jennie
there
are
lots
of
other
things
to
think
about
rosy
came
home
at
four
rhodes
dropped
her
on
her
own
way
southward
bertie
patterson
nodded
sleepily
in
one
corner
of
the
carriage
she
was
unused
to
late
hours
and
had
been
ready
to
go
long
before
but
rosy
made
it
plain
to
all
involved
that
she
regarded
herself
as
the
first
to
be
considered
she
did
not
design
leaving
a
minute
sooner
or
a
minute
later
than
her
own
good
pleasure
should
will
her
card
was
filled
to
the
last
line
and
she
danced
it
out
with
william
bates
with
arthur
paston
and
with
a
score
of
other
young
men
for
whose
names
the
present
pages
have
no
need
in
the
course
of
a
week
arthur
paston
called
truesdale
who
happened
to
be
at
home
found
himself
regarding
paston
presence
with
something
the
reverse
of
complacency
and
his
bearing
with
something
that
distinctly
approached
disapproval
he
recalled
to
mind
many
of
the
diversions
in
which
they
had
participated
together
and
he
felt
offended
that
paston
should
bring
here
the
same
jaunty
familiar
ways
that
he
had
displayed
in
other
scenes
but
slightly
approved
by
propriety
he
would
have
preferred
a
line
of
conduct
suggestive
in
some
small
degree
at
least
of
the
penitent
the
chastened
the
abashed
a
laugh
less
ready
a
smile
less
confident
a
bearing
less
less
divested
of
any
sense
of
his
need
of
tolerance
charity
forbearance
i
precisely
like
his
acting
in
that
free
fashion
here
with
rosy
thought
truesdale
there
are
times
and
times
and
there
are
places
and
places
his
thought
presently
turned
towards
himself
he
had
no
less
need
truly
of
charity
and
forbearance
than
paston
yet
he
was
not
in
the
habit
to
any
great
degree
of
adjusting
his
own
manner
to
varying
conditions
he
treated
other
fellows
sisters
just
as
paston
was
treating
his
the
idealizing
gaze
of
little
bertie
patterson
was
upon
him
it
was
not
precisely
with
reverence
certainly
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
treating
her
for
example
and
the
other
girl
with
the
red
gown
and
the
eyes
her
he
had
treated
almost
with
open
derision
but
that
was
different
paston
cheery
laugh
rang
out
from
the
parlor
truesdale
stood
in
the
library
before
the
bookcase
reading
the
tarnished
titles
of
the
few
spare
volumes
as
he
shifted
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
another
uncertain
whether
to
advance
or
to
retire
paston
knew
him
for
what
he
was
but
bertie
patterson
he
felt
sure
would
never
acknowledge
that
he
could
be
guilty
of
any
wrong
hideous
thing
to
be
poetized
thought
truesdale
but
they
all
do
it
in
one
way
or
another
he
thought
of
the
faithful
little
hearts
that
beat
in
the
german
garrison
towns
poems
i
could
easily
be
better
than
i
am
history
of
the
american
revolution
volume
one
volume
two
and
i
must
try
to
be
lamplighter
wide
wide
world
oh
curse
that
fellow
funny
stories
as
rosy
ready
laugh
came
from
the
next
room
truesdale
blushed
as
he
thought
of
some
of
the
stories
that
paston
could
tell
when
so
minded
and
he
stamped
his
foot
that
such
a
such
a
he
found
no
word
should
be
telling
his
sister
any
story
at
all
but
he
as
good
as
i
am
truesdale
was
forced
to
avow
as
he
passed
through
the
hallway
and
ascended
to
his
room
and
better
than
lots
of
others
what
can
say
or
do
rosy
herself
however
would
have
asked
for
no
change
in
paston
manner
she
found
him
charming
fascinating
compared
with
him
william
bates
was
far
from
entertaining
if
paston
had
attempted
the
chastened
the
deprecatory
she
would
have
feared
that
he
was
not
enjoying
himself
she
would
have
taken
but
little
satisfaction
in
deference
pushed
to
humility
she
was
beginning
to
idealize
him
as
bertie
patterson
had
begun
to
idealize
her
brother
but
rosy
idealization
was
not
half
so
generous
while
walking
on
his
arm
a
week
ago
she
had
not
felt
her
self
in
a
public
hall
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
her
own
home
no
she
was
at
buckingham
palace
or
at
james
she
was
not
sure
which
there
were
moments
indeed
when
it
was
not
a
palace
at
all
it
was
the
terrace
of
some
tudor
house
with
stone
balls
on
all
the
posts
or
it
was
the
trim
path
of
some
village
bordered
by
and
by
tombstones
with
cherubs
heads
and
she
was
the
bride
of
a
month
and
this
was
her
first
service
in
england
the
people
around
them
figured
no
longer
as
the
swell
crush
of
london
but
as
a
respectful
tenantry
who
fell
off
on
either
side
as
she
passed
out
to
her
carriage
on
her
husband
arm
there
were
glimpses
too
of
forgeries
and
murders
and
lost
wills
and
stolen
jewels
and
people
drowned
in
wells
in
one
book
there
had
been
a
maniac
girl
shut
up
in
a
room
but
she
should
try
to
avoid
all
these
superfluities
a
duchess
in
possession
of
her
senses
would
be
decidedly
preferable
a
week
later
and
she
was
deeper
in
burke
and
debrett
than
ever
well
here
it
is
finally
saltonstall
scamperdown
rosy
bent
her
head
and
studied
the
large
gilt
volume
with
redoubled
vigor
it
pretty
near
the
end
after
all
rosy
sat
at
a
desk
in
a
big
new
granite
building
to
one
side
of
a
small
park
above
the
appeared
the
tops
of
trees
the
towers
and
gables
of
a
pair
of
churches
the
dark
and
dignified
fa√ßade
of
a
and
the
various
elements
that
make
up
one
of
the
local
views
which
bear
in
any
great
degree
the
stamp
of
civilization
around
her
people
fluttered
leaves
or
put
books
back
on
their
shelves
or
carried
on
the
cataloguing
of
a
large
and
but
library
but
rosy
gave
heed
to
none
of
this
she
said
here
a
whole
paragraph
and
she
buried
herself
in
it
at
once
she
had
begun
with
the
queen
and
the
royal
family
and
the
order
of
precedence
then
she
had
gone
through
the
dukes
very
carefully
then
through
the
marquesses
not
so
carefully
then
through
the
earls
somewhat
cursorily
here
one
with
eight
daughters
the
honourable
and
seven
more
then
she
had
bolted
through
the
viscounts
and
barons
this
one
awfully
new
only
from
then
she
slid
lightly
over
the
baronets
then
she
passed
on
to
the
knights
i
do
suppose
it
but
it
was
sir
that
a
pretty
good
name
thought
the
girl
in
entered
life
guards
in
married
in
to
dau
of
james
lord
lyndhurst
i
wonder
if
she
was
of
higher
rank
than
he
oh
here
we
come
to
his
own
rank
of
colonel
general
served
in
egyptian
campaign
of
appointed
to
her
majesty
in
ever
so
many
capital
letters
a
lot
more
whatever
do
they
mean
does
he
wear
stars
and
things
and
where
he
lives
park
witham
essex
and
somewhere
else
too
gardens
kensington
that
in
london
i
suppose
and
here
are
his
clubs
and
united
service
only
two
why
lots
of
the
others
have
five
or
six
but
papa
has
got
one
even
besides
think
of
ever
being
in
a
book
she
paused
a
moment
in
perplexity
but
where
are
his
children
all
the
sons
and
daughters
and
when
they
were
born
and
who
they
married
and
everything
it
tells
in
the
dukes
and
earls
never
mind
though
i
do
need
a
book
for
that
boxton
park
witham
essex
she
mused
the
posts
came
back
again
with
the
stone
balls
on
top
of
them
and
a
few
and
a
peacock
or
two
strutting
on
a
terrace
the
prospect
widened
ditches
and
under
a
low
gray
sky
packs
of
yelping
hounds
hunters
following
in
red
coats
rosamund
went
home
in
a
thoughtful
mood
it
was
within
a
fortnight
of
this
that
she
was
taking
hurdles
at
her
this
involved
still
another
horse
and
a
habit
and
a
saddle
rosamund
was
teaching
her
father
how
to
spend
money
no
other
member
of
the
family
save
truesdale
had
ever
attempted
as
much
are
we
going
on
forever
living
in
this
same
old
place
rosy
asked
her
mother
one
day
she
had
fallen
into
the
way
of
making
comparisons
between
boxton
park
and
no
two
hundred
and
michigan
avenue
just
as
she
had
made
comparisons
with
the
many
fine
houses
where
she
had
lately
been
entertained
i
do
expect
to
live
anywhere
forever
replied
her
mother
tartly
it
so
old
and
dismal
rosy
went
on
i
declare
i
hate
almost
to
ask
anybody
here
and
it
getting
so
noisy
and
dirty
and
all
those
awful
people
over
there
on
those
streets
behind
us
eliza
marshall
thought
flew
swiftly
towards
the
dealer
of
those
purlieus
who
had
carried
away
so
much
good
solid
furniture
and
then
had
declined
to
pay
for
it
but
this
did
not
prevent
her
from
looking
on
her
child
now
as
if
a
viper
warmed
at
her
hearth
had
roused
to
life
and
stung
her
why
ca
we
change
rosy
proceeded
why
ca
we
move
why
ca
we
build
somewhere
where
we
can
have
neighbors
and
a
house
to
invite
them
to
what
do
you
call
the
blackburns
and
the
freemans
asked
her
mother
severely
where
can
you
find
nicer
folks
why
do
we
want
to
chase
after
a
lot
of
new
people
that
we
do
know
anything
about
the
blackburns
and
the
freemans
are
no
company
for
me
rosy
declared
all
the
people
i
know
are
up
on
the
north
side
or
down
on
prairie
avenue
the
north
side
repeated
her
mother
out
of
all
patience
i
see
myself
moving
to
the
north
side
at
my
time
of
life
after
living
on
this
side
for
more
than
forty
years
i
should
feel
as
much
at
home
in
milwaukee
and
do
talk
to
me
about
prairie
either
as
long
as
i
live
i
live
on
michigan
and
nowhere
else
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
about
it
no
not
a
word
while
rosy
assailed
her
mother
about
the
house
jane
attacked
her
father
about
himself
her
social
triumphs
so
she
regarded
them
had
made
her
more
ambitious
and
more
aggressive
than
ever
she
was
less
solicitous
about
the
family
in
general
which
seemed
to
be
moving
on
satisfactorily
enough
than
she
was
about
the
head
of
it
himself
who
appeared
distinctly
to
be
lagging
behind
marshall
now
listened
to
his
daughter
urgings
with
a
more
serious
consideration
she
was
only
saying
to
him
what
older
and
more
experienced
people
had
said
already
susan
bates
for
example
and
tom
bingham
susan
bates
in
fact
had
renewed
the
attack
and
she
prosecuted
it
whenever
occasion
offered
she
had
not
scrupled
indeed
to
pursue
the
theme
within
the
precincts
of
her
own
house
bates
had
not
yet
achieved
the
peculiar
aboriginal
function
which
she
had
outlined
to
jane
in
the
course
of
their
first
talk
the
reel
the
old
settlers
and
the
young
squaws
to
pour
firewater
were
still
in
the
future
but
she
had
entertained
the
marshalls
at
dinner
and
she
had
pushed
the
subject
with
still
greater
insistency
in
her
own
house
than
at
david
marshall
office
for
the
occasion
of
the
marshall
dinner
bates
put
her
household
on
a
peace
footing
she
banished
as
far
as
possible
all
traces
of
social
she
determined
to
dispense
with
as
many
of
the
as
might
be
and
to
have
those
who
were
left
over
wear
their
plainest
liveries
she
even
thought
of
arranging
to
have
the
marshalls
ring
answered
by
a
maid
instead
of
a
footman
so
when
david
marshall
came
in
the
that
had
not
seen
the
light
for
over
a
year
and
eliza
marshall
in
the
silk
whose
only
recent
airing
had
been
at
rosy
they
had
little
to
contend
against
save
the
house
itself
and
its
furnishings
jane
accompanied
them
tom
bingham
is
going
to
take
you
out
bates
announced
he
is
very
much
interested
in
you
he
thinks
you
are
quite
a
clever
girl
all
right
replied
jane
i
interested
in
him
too
i
think
him
a
person
of
great
discernment
i
had
some
notion
of
asking
rosy
at
first
billy
was
so
taken
with
her
but
this
is
really
an
old
folks
party
after
all
besides
billy
had
a
theatre
engagement
sorry
said
jane
i
sure
pa
and
ma
would
have
liked
to
meet
him
whatever
little
plan
bates
may
have
been
revolving
in
her
mind
jane
was
too
loyal
to
throw
cold
water
on
it
so
should
i
myself
susan
bates
gave
the
marshalls
a
short
plain
dinner
she
had
no
desire
to
glorify
herself
or
to
embarrass
her
guests
but
eliza
marshall
learned
more
of
contemporanics
in
that
one
evening
than
she
had
picked
up
in
the
previous
decade
she
learned
how
people
received
how
they
set
their
tables
and
served
them
how
they
built
their
houses
and
furnished
them
she
learned
not
only
the
possibilities
but
the
actualities
of
splendor
and
luxury
in
the
town
where
she
had
led
a
retired
and
humdrum
existence
for
nearly
a
lifetime
she
now
thrust
her
head
forth
from
her
dim
old
cavern
and
fed
her
eyes
on
the
flowers
and
fields
and
skies
and
goodly
streams
of
the
great
world
outside
while
jane
supported
her
mother
against
the
lumbering
charges
of
granger
bates
conversational
cavalry
his
wife
engrossed
marshall
attention
for
her
dormitory
her
plans
had
taken
shape
in
her
own
mind
and
were
now
beginning
to
take
shape
on
paper
it
more
than
a
mere
dormitory
of
course
she
cleared
a
space
between
them
and
took
up
a
here
the
vestibule
and
she
began
drawing
with
the
spoon
on
the
and
here
where
the
stairs
run
up
off
to
this
side
john
do
take
some
of
these
glasses
away
off
to
this
side
with
a
wider
sweep
of
the
spoon
is
a
sort
of
parlor
and
quite
a
good
size
you
see
right
next
to
it
is
the
so
that
they
can
be
thrown
together
when
the
girls
receive
good
said
bingham
nothing
more
civilizing
than
receptions
on
this
side
of
the
pursued
bates
is
going
to
be
a
sort
of
alcove
jane
dear
just
push
me
over
that
salt
and
pepper
there
she
planted
the
two
bottles
in
her
alcove
that
the
tank
for
tea
and
this
is
the
tank
for
coffee
practical
do
you
think
to
bingham
and
i
suppose
you
have
a
screen
that
you
can
put
in
front
precisely
she
laid
a
tiny
spoon
across
her
alcove
hardwood
floors
throughout
bedrooms
for
fifty
girls
and
each
one
shall
have
a
closet
if
possible
we
begin
the
foundations
in
five
or
six
weeks
as
soon
as
the
frost
is
out
susan
bates
cleared
a
larger
space
and
appropriated
more
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
and
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
for
marshall
ear
alone
jane
strained
to
catch
her
words
she
saw
her
father
blush
once
slightly
and
then
smile
as
if
partly
flustered
as
jane
herself
phrased
it
what
a
dear
good
old
sentimental
soul
she
is
thought
the
girl
bet
a
cent
she
is
asking
pa
to
put
up
a
dormitory
for
boys
on
the
other
side
of
the
campus
bates
presently
carried
jane
and
her
mother
into
the
library
leaving
the
men
behind
to
contemplate
a
litter
of
disordered
wineglasses
and
dishevelled
napkins
and
to
smoke
themselves
out
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
to
the
women
bates
talk
here
as
heretofore
was
frankly
personal
on
a
previous
occasion
she
had
talked
to
rosy
mother
about
rosy
now
she
exacted
that
rosy
mother
should
talk
to
her
about
her
own
boy
billy
the
best
boy
in
the
world
his
father
says
he
making
a
splendid
business
man
she
took
a
cabinet
photograph
from
over
the
fireplace
there
this
is
the
latest
but
it
does
do
him
any
kind
of
justice
well
he
got
a
real
face
said
eliza
marshall
and
a
real
face
too
rejoined
his
mother
quickly
jane
dear
run
up
to
my
room
and
get
the
one
before
this
that
something
like
second
drawer
on
the
left
and
stop
eying
those
books
you
get
at
them
with
anything
less
than
a
but
why
should
you
depend
on
pictures
bates
observed
presently
see
the
boy
yourself
go
next
time
he
calls
oh
he
will
call
again
i
assure
you
concluded
susan
bates
archly
tell
him
to
inquire
for
ma
and
send
in
a
card
for
her
too
whispered
jane
rosy
getting
awfully
sticky
yes
fussy
stiff
critical
that
what
it
means
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
it
a
word
dick
brought
home
from
london
h
said
susan
bates
i
remember
it
the
men
meanwhile
sat
round
the
table
marshall
smoked
with
the
others
and
tried
to
forget
his
boutonni√®re
the
first
he
had
ever
worn
i
shall
make
them
very
small
and
unobtrusive
susan
bates
had
said
only
a
dozen
violets
marshall
noticed
that
bates
had
put
his
flowers
into
his
and
bingham
his
into
his
left
jane
saw
her
father
hesitate
finally
he
imitated
bates
well
that
cutting
it
pretty
fine
thought
the
girl
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
right
or
wrong
way
but
think
of
pa
with
any
bouquet
at
all
we
shall
budge
him
yet
she
smiled
she
knew
the
forces
were
all
arrayed
against
him
what
this
town
needs
more
than
anything
else
bingham
was
saying
is
a
big
assembly
hall
one
with
a
capacity
of
ten
thousand
say
something
not
too
fine
we
got
that
already
and
something
not
too
rough
had
that
in
plenty
a
hall
suitable
for
conventions
for
promenade
concerts
for
for
horse
shows
in
short
something
after
the
fashion
of
that
magnificent
thing
in
new
york
the
madison
square
garden
asked
bates
you
perfectly
right
now
that
garden
pursued
bingham
is
not
exactly
a
paying
investment
was
meant
to
be
the
last
time
i
was
down
east
yes
some
fellows
there
quoted
it
to
me
as
an
evidence
of
public
spirit
the
spirit
that
we
here
suppose
not
to
exist
in
new
york
at
all
the
men
who
put
it
up
could
easily
have
got
more
on
their
money
but
there
it
stands
one
of
the
most
useful
and
beneficent
features
of
the
whole
city
we
ought
to
have
one
here
declared
bates
and
i
should
like
to
build
it
declared
bingham
the
man
who
would
give
such
a
thing
to
chicago
or
who
would
even
take
the
headship
of
it
and
make
a
suitable
contribution
would
be
doing
as
much
for
himself
and
for
the
town
as
any
one
man
well
could
but
do
look
at
me
said
bates
my
wife
has
drained
me
dry
you
know
about
her
dormitory
and
all
her
other
schemes
look
at
well
look
at
marshall
what
is
marshall
doing
for
the
good
of
the
city
marshall
lowered
his
eyes
and
fingered
the
broad
foot
of
an
empty
wineglass
he
sat
between
two
of
the
great
powers
of
the
town
and
he
had
never
felt
smaller
he
wondered
whether
he
had
deserved
his
success
he
wondered
if
he
himself
had
really
made
it
after
all
he
had
come
on
the
ground
before
competition
had
fairly
set
in
he
had
done
nothing
by
force
or
by
audacity
he
had
been
slow
cautious
even
timorous
and
he
confessed
inwardly
that
there
were
men
in
his
own
employ
men
on
a
mere
salary
who
were
cleverer
readier
more
resourceful
than
he
men
who
in
a
fair
field
and
on
even
terms
could
have
distanced
him
completely
he
gave
the
wineglass
another
turn
or
two
and
did
not
lift
his
eyes
he
heard
bingham
voice
again
it
was
declaring
that
in
the
history
of
every
great
mercantile
city
there
was
a
single
short
period
a
passing
moment
almost
on
which
the
citizen
who
wished
to
impress
himself
upon
the
community
and
to
imbed
himself
in
the
local
annals
must
seize
marshall
heard
him
instancing
the
fuggers
of
augsburg
and
the
loredani
and
morosini
of
venice
and
the
medici
and
tornabuoni
of
florence
and
many
other
names
alien
and
all
unfamiliar
merchants
most
of
them
it
seemed
who
had
perpetuated
their
name
and
fame
by
improving
the
precise
moment
when
their
town
like
was
taking
its
set
make
your
impression
while
you
may
concluded
bingham
this
is
the
time
this
very
year
the
man
who
makes
his
mark
here
will
enjoy
a
fame
which
will
spread
as
the
fame
of
the
city
spreads
and
its
power
and
prosperity
increases
you
know
what
we
are
destined
to
be
a
hundred
times
greater
than
we
are
fasten
your
name
on
the
town
and
your
name
will
grow
as
the
town
itself
does
marshall
drove
home
thoughtfully
in
the
new
carriage
with
the
new
horses
and
august
in
his
new
eliza
marshall
who
had
sat
gingerly
upon
the
edge
of
her
seat
in
driving
out
now
leaned
back
at
her
ease
when
returning
it
seemed
that
with
a
little
practice
she
might
easily
become
habituated
to
luxury
as
she
her
old
familiar
parlor
she
almost
gave
a
gulp
of
mortification
over
its
plainness
and
shabbiness
for
the
first
time
in
years
she
had
given
herself
a
chance
to
know
it
for
what
it
was
there
now
jane
declared
loudly
you
both
seen
what
money
and
brains
can
do
well
have
got
money
have
got
brains
is
there
any
reason
why
should
be
known
and
looked
up
to
and
respected
and
at
breakfast
next
morning
she
opened
out
upon
her
father
once
more
her
was
now
thanks
to
her
solicitings
and
her
concert
in
full
running
order
and
moving
on
to
a
marked
success
she
was
rising
to
a
more
ambitious
plane
not
a
college
building
not
an
no
during
the
watches
of
the
night
she
had
risen
to
the
conception
of
a
home
her
father
had
been
listening
to
the
mellow
and
flowing
hautboy
of
susan
bates
and
to
the
deep
diapason
of
tom
bingham
but
his
daughter
had
now
pulled
out
the
coupler
and
was
screaming
shrilly
above
all
the
other
voices
of
the
organ
he
felt
almost
deafened
stunned
the
second
girl
came
in
frightened
what
is
it
asked
eliza
marshall
august
is
in
the
kitchen
with
his
face
all
cut
and
bleeding
jane
left
her
father
let
me
go
out
and
see
what
it
is
it
was
another
chapter
in
the
van
horn
matter
roger
having
become
more
familiar
with
methods
had
been
pushing
things
with
greater
vigor
and
effect
during
the
past
night
two
or
three
ruffians
had
broken
into
the
stable
had
shattered
the
windows
of
the
new
carriage
and
defaced
its
panels
and
had
beaten
the
coachman
there
cried
rosy
how
much
longer
have
we
got
to
live
down
here
among
all
these
savages
and
hoodlums
eliza
marshall
made
no
reply
and
rosy
felt
that
this
in
itself
was
to
have
gained
a
point
xiii
eliza
marshall
meditated
on
the
bates
dinner
for
several
days
succeeding
and
when
the
following
saturday
morning
came
round
she
was
still
busy
with
it
saturday
was
her
day
for
going
over
the
antiquated
accumulations
of
her
parlor
no
hands
ever
dusted
and
replaced
the
ornaments
on
her
save
her
own
she
had
been
very
chary
of
expressing
herself
about
susan
bates
entertainment
even
to
jane
but
now
she
felt
that
the
time
had
come
when
she
might
trust
herself
to
speak
i
ca
say
i
see
the
need
of
so
many
kinds
of
spoons
she
said
as
she
transferred
one
of
her
gilt
candelabra
from
the
to
the
contorted
old
rosewood
the
candelabra
were
of
an
operatic
cast
the
one
under
removal
represented
though
all
unknown
to
eliza
marshall
manrico
and
leonora
clasped
in
each
other
arms
beneath
a
tree
cut
right
through
the
middle
too
so
that
you
could
hardly
tell
whether
they
were
spoons
or
forks
what
could
be
better
for
or
salad
asked
jane
who
was
blooming
forth
as
an
authority
on
matters
social
she
sometimes
assisted
her
mother
on
these
saturday
mornings
under
close
supervision
and
three
kinds
of
wineglasses
observed
her
mother
with
some
disapproval
sort
of
showy
i
thought
kind
of
as
if
they
wanted
to
impress
us
and
let
us
see
what
no
she
cried
as
a
figure
came
up
the
front
walk
carrying
a
tray
fastened
in
front
no
tell
him
we
do
want
any
suspenders
or
we
do
wear
them
showy
called
jane
my
sakes
it
was
the
plainest
thing
i
ever
saw
at
their
house
if
you
could
see
of
their
doings
eliza
marshall
set
back
the
candelabrum
and
transferred
her
attention
to
a
rock
of
ages
in
parian
marble
i
believe
things
get
dirtier
here
every
year
i
sure
more
dust
comes
in
at
that
window
than
goes
out
then
well
i
do
see
but
what
we
as
good
as
anybody
else
i
do
see
but
what
we
are
as
well
worth
taking
pains
for
she
ran
her
cloth
resentfully
between
the
arms
of
faith
and
the
arms
of
the
cross
oh
dear
me
suz
cried
jane
are
you
trying
to
get
the
poor
woman
both
ways
her
dinner
was
just
right
and
i
am
sure
she
took
every
possible
pains
to
have
it
so
what
called
her
mother
craning
her
neck
and
contorting
her
features
a
locomotive
was
letting
off
steam
opposite
the
house
and
the
noise
and
the
vapor
came
across
the
hundred
yards
of
dead
grass
together
i
say
it
was
all
right
shouted
jane
do
you
suppose
she
knows
how
to
dear
me
what
the
use
of
trying
to
talk
here
she
fell
on
the
and
dusted
its
vases
in
silent
desperation
her
mother
accepted
this
dictum
as
final
a
proof
of
jane
altered
status
and
of
the
discretion
with
which
she
was
carrying
herself
of
course
i
am
not
a
society
girl
was
the
way
jane
turned
the
matter
over
in
her
own
head
i
am
a
benevolent
old
maid
with
a
capacity
for
society
when
occasion
offers
jane
had
kept
this
point
distinctly
in
view
and
had
now
extricated
herself
from
the
squeezed
and
anomalous
position
which
for
the
last
few
years
she
had
occupied
between
her
two
sisters
alice
thinks
she
knows
everything
just
because
she
married
jane
had
said
to
herself
a
year
back
and
rosy
thinks
she
knows
everything
just
because
well
i
sure
i
ca
exactly
tell
why
but
anyhow
between
the
two
i
being
pretty
well
flattened
out
got
to
do
and
she
had
jane
running
on
the
new
track
she
had
laid
down
for
herself
had
regained
the
consideration
of
alice
and
had
even
conquered
the
respect
of
rosy
indeed
so
far
had
she
triumphed
with
her
younger
sister
that
rosy
was
even
showing
civility
and
goodwill
to
theodore
brower
whose
regard
for
jane
had
brought
about
his
social
rehabilitation
i
wonder
why
he
never
cut
his
beard
to
a
point
before
rosy
said
one
day
he
looks
ever
so
much
better
and
i
see
that
he
has
finally
provided
himself
with
well
if
he
leaves
one
behind
every
time
he
comes
we
shall
soon
have
a
fine
litter
he
wo
though
said
jane
except
when
he
calls
on
you
well
he
may
call
on
me
if
he
chooses
responded
rosy
with
a
gracious
condescension
i
sure
he
talks
very
sensibly
never
fear
retorted
jane
he
is
competing
with
the
british
aristocracy
then
rosy
would
go
for
a
bit
of
practice
to
cover
a
sheet
with
such
words
as
these
lady
rosamund
rosamund
countess
of
the
honourable
rosamund
she
lingered
fondly
over
the
baptismal
rosamund
what
word
could
match
more
fitly
with
a
title
or
harmonize
more
completely
with
the
grand
old
names
of
the
peerage
once
she
wrote
on
the
extreme
lower
corner
of
the
sheet
bates
oh
pshaw
she
exclaimed
and
tore
the
corner
off
and
threw
it
into
the
fire
the
locomotive
had
relieved
itself
and
no
noise
remained
save
the
jangling
of
a
long
line
of
on
another
track
those
people
who
repaired
the
carriage
resumed
eliza
marshall
now
beginning
on
one
of
her
dresden
figures
those
people
who
repaired
the
carriage
spoke
to
your
father
about
shoo
that
tramp
out
of
the
side
yard
of
we
have
got
anything
for
him
this
time
of
day
they
spoke
to
your
father
about
she
paused
and
began
to
bestow
an
exaggerated
care
upon
the
figure
now
under
her
hands
a
of
seville
jane
paused
in
her
own
work
and
waited
for
the
rest
well
she
asked
presently
her
mother
wiped
the
head
of
the
very
carefully
the
girl
had
black
hair
parted
in
the
middle
and
laid
in
two
wide
scallops
over
her
ears
they
told
your
father
they
were
looking
for
a
site
to
build
a
new
warehouse
on
jane
heart
gave
a
throb
well
her
mother
applied
herself
painstakingly
to
the
apron
and
petticoat
of
the
dancer
a
petticoat
striped
in
purple
and
green
and
sprigged
over
with
some
species
of
flower
wholly
she
drew
her
cloth
down
every
stripe
they
said
they
were
hoping
to
find
something
just
about
in
in
this
neighborhood
jane
shrank
and
trembled
as
if
before
a
knife
well
her
mother
passed
on
to
the
girl
slippers
she
wiped
the
worn
gilt
of
one
stubby
foot
and
then
of
the
other
they
asked
him
to
put
a
price
on
on
on
our
home
cried
jane
there
was
a
tear
in
each
eye
as
she
bowed
her
head
over
the
her
mother
returned
to
the
rock
of
ages
and
began
to
dust
it
again
as
carefully
as
before
well
she
said
slowly
without
turning
round
there
a
building
of
that
same
sort
a
block
or
two
south
of
us
already
she
lingered
on
the
short
arm
of
the
cross
the
blackburns
are
talking
of
going
you
know
jane
bowed
her
head
again
and
picked
at
the
fringe
of
the
a
foolish
thing
that
she
herself
had
embroidered
and
draped
now
for
the
first
time
she
formulated
her
mother
i
half
known
it
all
along
she
thought
and
now
i
know
it
for
sure
in
this
moment
she
definitely
saw
her
mother
not
as
a
creature
of
the
affections
but
as
a
creature
of
mere
habit
and
it
been
so
for
the
last
twenty
years
thought
the
poor
girl
eliza
marshall
passed
back
to
one
of
the
candelabra
its
cracked
prisms
tinkled
as
her
broken
talk
went
on
well
i
do
know
i
sure
our
last
neighbors
are
leaving
us
business
and
all
around
and
rosy
wants
to
change
and
there
so
much
noise
and
dirt
and
so
many
peddlers
and
beggars
and
and
she
was
thinking
of
susan
library
but
would
not
permit
herself
a
spoken
reference
to
it
and
so
much
work
to
keep
things
tidy
and
those
miserable
fellows
breaking
into
our
barn
i
do
know
i
sure
marshall
himself
meanwhile
talked
the
matter
over
with
belden
and
with
roger
when
roger
came
in
to
consider
the
assault
on
the
stable
and
the
policy
of
employing
the
police
i
do
know
that
i
should
depend
too
much
on
the
city
detectives
he
had
observed
but
i
will
have
them
go
down
to
the
house
if
you
say
accordingly
one
morning
a
brace
of
young
irishmen
modestly
traversed
the
sidewalk
which
led
around
the
house
and
knocked
with
some
show
of
decorum
at
the
kitchen
door
each
had
the
fresh
complexion
of
a
recent
arrival
chestnut
hair
plastered
in
a
scallop
on
his
forehead
room
under
his
nose
for
a
large
red
mustache
and
room
under
his
for
a
noticeable
quantity
of
matter
misplaced
presently
they
put
on
their
derby
hats
again
and
went
out
to
visit
the
stable
then
they
took
their
departure
and
were
never
heard
of
more
the
next
detective
rang
at
the
front
door
he
wore
gloves
and
a
high
silk
hat
he
was
a
tough
and
person
whose
progress
rearward
the
family
attended
with
a
close
watch
on
their
portable
property
he
seemed
much
more
corrupt
and
knowing
than
any
mere
could
be
he
was
more
efficacious
too
than
the
duo
that
had
preceded
him
even
in
the
stable
he
gave
much
less
heed
to
august
than
to
august
mistress
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
he
put
his
hands
on
the
offenders
ten
to
one
he
could
have
done
that
without
having
visited
the
premises
at
all
roger
was
the
family
counsellor
in
matters
of
investment
as
well
as
matters
of
law
he
had
early
made
the
observation
that
few
lawyers
amassed
a
fortune
in
the
strict
practice
of
their
profession
and
he
had
accordingly
turned
a
prompt
attention
to
building
and
to
land
operating
largely
for
himself
and
for
his
father
and
to
the
advantage
of
both
indeed
manipulations
in
real
estate
had
done
more
for
david
fortune
than
had
the
pursuit
of
the
grocery
business
just
as
they
had
done
more
for
his
son
than
the
pursuit
of
the
law
your
mother
wo
live
anywhere
but
on
michigan
though
he
declared
to
roger
she
need
the
other
rejoined
move
south
three
miles
if
you
mean
to
make
any
change
at
all
the
best
houses
in
town
are
going
up
along
that
stretch
just
within
the
old
limits
and
a
house
there
could
be
turned
into
money
at
any
time
roger
as
a
practical
man
naturally
put
convertibility
before
domesticity
marshall
also
canvassed
the
matter
with
belden
belden
listened
to
him
somewhat
coldly
and
impassively
with
less
interest
the
old
man
thought
than
one
partner
rightly
should
but
belden
took
the
idea
of
a
new
house
as
another
step
in
the
social
advance
of
the
marshalls
it
seemed
to
him
almost
like
the
challenge
of
a
rival
and
a
rivalry
like
this
nettled
him
none
the
less
from
being
so
sudden
so
unexpected
so
impracticable
as
six
months
back
he
would
have
considered
it
he
felt
himself
and
his
family
outdone
at
every
point
rosamund
marshall
had
eclipsed
his
own
daughter
at
a
dozen
dances
truesdale
marshall
thanks
to
the
patronage
of
the
press
was
becoming
in
his
way
a
celebrity
while
his
own
son
merely
led
a
dubious
existence
which
oscillated
between
the
bar
of
the
metropole
and
the
of
the
lexington
and
conferred
little
distinction
upon
himself
of
anybody
else
and
even
dusty
old
eliza
marshall
almost
despite
herself
was
being
dragged
up
into
a
circle
to
which
his
own
wife
notwithstanding
all
her
lavish
and
industrious
endeavor
remained
as
alien
as
at
the
beginning
and
to
crown
all
marshall
himself
had
finally
come
forth
as
a
public
figure
belden
had
actually
been
obliged
to
sit
at
a
and
to
hear
this
old
man
usually
so
quiet
and
inexpressive
loudly
applauded
by
a
hundred
businessmen
who
a
month
before
had
received
an
effort
of
his
own
with
mere
civil
toleration
this
new
advance
of
marshall
was
made
partly
by
jane
help
partly
in
spite
of
it
speak
she
had
said
when
her
father
broached
the
subject
one
evening
of
course
you
speak
you
know
all
about
the
topic
if
anybody
does
and
here
an
opportunity
right
at
your
hand
i
help
you
get
up
your
speech
myself
she
did
she
prepared
a
long
address
after
the
most
approved
rhetorical
models
a
flowing
introduction
which
walked
all
around
the
subject
before
going
into
it
a
telling
peroration
whose
emphatic
periods
seemed
to
render
any
subsequent
consideration
of
the
matter
a
mere
piece
of
futility
and
in
between
briefly
and
cursorily
the
one
or
two
vital
points
of
the
whole
discourse
thus
equipped
david
marshall
was
to
rise
at
half
an
hour
before
midnight
the
last
but
one
of
a
long
line
of
speakers
to
claim
the
attention
of
a
great
roomful
of
men
sated
with
meat
and
drink
and
sodden
with
oratory
but
in
the
the
manuscript
had
slipped
from
his
pocket
and
at
the
table
all
its
overwrought
periods
had
slipped
from
his
mind
and
at
midnight
he
rose
to
confront
an
expanse
of
disordered
and
an
array
of
wearied
faces
his
own
ace
full
of
uncertainty
and
nothing
to
nerve
his
inexperience
save
a
desperate
determination
not
to
disappoint
his
daughter
another
old
bore
getting
up
from
a
distant
corner
of
the
smoky
room
any
idea
who
he
is
not
the
slightest
a
yawn
take
another
regalia
david
marshall
had
forgotten
everything
but
his
main
points
and
the
facts
that
supported
them
he
began
in
the
very
midst
of
things
he
spoke
a
minute
and
a
quarter
plainly
simply
and
sat
down
the
instant
he
had
finished
he
had
spoken
in
his
usual
husky
and
sibilant
voice
nobody
had
called
louder
however
because
nobody
had
really
wished
to
hear
on
his
ending
the
room
rang
with
applause
the
applause
of
gratitude
largely
well
the
old
fellow
can
say
his
say
after
all
eh
and
no
blooming
oratory
either
and
sense
enough
to
cut
it
short
the
last
man
usually
shows
the
least
mercy
as
marshall
sat
down
his
neighbor
on
the
right
shook
his
hand
warmly
why
have
you
been
doing
this
for
us
before
as
he
was
leaving
the
hall
the
secretary
of
another
club
present
by
accident
solicited
an
address
on
a
cognate
subject
for
a
coming
meeting
of
his
own
organization
why
did
you
give
yourself
a
little
more
time
he
asked
jane
was
wild
with
pride
and
pleasure
her
father
had
given
her
the
results
and
not
the
process
i
knew
you
could
poppy
i
just
knew
you
could
we
start
in
on
the
other
speech
right
away
and
make
it
even
better
than
this
we
show
yet
but
it
was
not
marshall
himself
for
all
the
inexplicable
ease
of
this
success
who
chiefly
angered
belden
nor
had
he
any
great
feeling
against
rosamund
having
no
undue
interest
in
the
social
rivalries
of
young
girls
nor
was
he
particularly
incensed
against
her
mother
being
offended
chiefly
by
the
ostentatious
and
invidious
shown
her
by
bates
but
against
truesdale
marshall
he
nourished
a
hot
and
rancorous
grievance
he
did
not
apprehend
truesdale
attitude
towards
the
town
at
large
and
the
young
man
manner
in
his
own
house
regardless
of
his
insolent
utterance
seemed
to
have
carried
a
curiosity
beyond
all
decent
bounds
that
young
cockerel
i
soon
find
a
way
to
quiet
his
crowing
what
does
all
his
singing
and
painting
and
fencing
amount
to
after
all
he
could
post
an
item
into
a
ledger
he
could
even
tie
up
a
pound
of
tea
he
work
off
any
of
his
foreign
smartness
on
truesdale
readily
figured
himself
the
reverse
of
to
the
beldens
and
stayed
away
but
this
did
not
prevent
his
reception
of
advices
more
or
less
regular
from
the
heart
of
the
belden
household
what
that
absurd
girl
up
to
time
he
asked
one
morning
as
an
envelope
directed
in
a
hand
already
too
familiar
came
to
the
door
he
recognized
readily
enough
the
sprawling
penmanship
of
gladys
mckenna
as
readily
as
he
divined
the
r√¥le
which
she
must
imagine
herself
to
be
playing
she
was
pretending
herself
to
be
a
prisoner
in
some
hostile
camp
a
hostage
in
some
dismal
dungeon
and
despite
the
close
and
suspicious
watchfulness
of
those
surrounding
her
she
was
still
sending
her
little
messages
all
the
same
to
her
on
the
opposing
side
in
the
end
her
reward
would
come
she
and
her
knight
ouf
cried
truesdale
who
scented
all
this
crass
and
forward
romanticism
between
the
trivial
lines
of
her
communications
why
does
she
write
when
she
has
got
anything
to
say
sometimes
she
have
something
to
say
a
little
to
her
statements
of
the
disposition
of
the
belden
family
towards
her
correspondent
and
to
her
general
recommendation
to
beware
would
be
tagged
indications
of
her
own
individual
movements
poor
auntie

laid
up
with
the
neuralgia
and
ethel

gone

add
destroy
this
or
burn
this
most
willingly
truesdale
would
exclaim
and
throw
this
in
the
fire
at
once
or
again
imagine
i
am
to
have
a
tooth
filled
auntie
says
i
trouble
to
go
away
there
is
a
very
good
man
right
on
street
early
she
says
try
to
be
over
with
it
by
eleven
so
that
you
can
enjoy
your
lunch
did
you
ever
know
of
such
thoughtfulness
no
i
never
did
acknowledged
truesdale
grimly
by
these
and
other
such
subterfuges
did
gladys
keep
her
epistolary
hand
in
until
the
time
came
when
she
really
had
something
of
consequence
to
communicate
once
or
twice
she
also
regaled
him
with
the
comments
of
the
beldens
on
the
building
projects
of
the
marshalls
truesdale
had
the
same
tepid
interest
for
these
advices
as
for
her
other
notes
and
comments
he
did
not
consider
himself
as
particularly
concerned
at
best
he
was
but
a
bird
of
passage
and
it
seemed
to
him
a
sad
error
to
load
one
self
down
with
so
dense
and
stationary
a
thing
as
a
house
the
conferences
over
this
matter
went
on
however
regardless
of
truesdale
jane
discussed
it
with
her
father
and
mother
and
rosy
handled
it
and
roger
and
alice
came
in
from
riverdale
park
to
stay
overnight
and
to
contend
with
jane
and
rosy
through
the
steak
and
the
in
the
morning
as
well
as
to
intimate
to
her
father
that
if
he
would
build
out
a
little
library
from
her
parlor
her
husband
could
pay
for
the
carpet
and
furniture
and
aunt
lydia
rhodes
came
now
and
then
and
fluttered
around
the
question
unsettling
points
that
had
been
looked
on
as
settled
for
good
and
all
and
raising
other
points
of
her
own
that
needed
no
consideration
whatever
and
at
the
end
of
a
wearisome
and
contentious
month
the
matter
with
what
seemed
to
everybody
an
extraordinary
and
reckless
precipitation
the
end
once
reached
was
finally
arranged
tom
bingham
was
to
build
them
a
house
in
the
neighborhood
favored
by
roger
and
was
to
find
an
architect
for
them
a
reversal
of
the
usual
procedure
which
afflicted
jane
with
grave
doubts
and
on
the
morning
of
the
earliest
day
of
spring
when
the
were
trilling
through
the
side
streets
and
the
were
offering
hurried
shoppers
their
earliest
verbenas
and
fuchsias
from
the
tail
ends
of
their
carts
jane
walked
down
to
the
store
to
look
at
the
signatures
on
the
contracts
for
the
new
house
ah
she
said
to
herself
thoughtfully
we
moving
faster
than
i
anticipated
and
not
precisely
in
the
direction
i
had
fancied
she
was
in
no
degree
elated
she
experienced
on
the
contrary
a
distinct
feeling
of
depression
xiv
during
those
active
weeks
which
followed
the
decision
of
the
family
to
surrender
their
old
home
to
business
and
to
contrive
another
one
in
a
new
neighborhood
towards
the
south
jane
had
taken
her
full
share
in
all
the
debates
and
consultations
hers
indeed
was
the
personality
which
impressed
itself
most
strongly
upon
the
young
architect
whom
bingham
brought
forward
to
evolve
the
plans
elevations
and
specifications
upon
which
he
himself
was
to
work
in
matters
architectural
jane
was
a
purist
of
the
purists
a
theorist
of
the
theorists
she
fought
this
young
man
steadily
on
points
of
style
and
never
abandoned
her
ground
until
the
exigencies
of
practicalities
reinforced
by
the
prejudices
of
her
mother
and
the
unillumined
indifference
of
her
father
proved
too
strong
to
be
withstood
well
she
would
say
if
we
have
got
to
sacrifice
art
to
and
the
young
man
was
both
amazed
and
exasperated
by
her
spirit
and
her
pertinacity
he
could
only
be
kept
in
trim
and
in
temper
by
bingham
frequent
assurances
that
she
was
a
very
clever
girl
and
a
very
one
after
all
jane
saw
the
plans
composed
discomposed
recomposed
and
finally
accepted
as
a
working
basis
then
in
the
interval
between
this
and
the
actual
commencement
of
construction
she
turned
back
a
diverted
attention
to
her
this
institution
at
the
start
had
required
her
attendance
and
ministrations
but
once
a
week
at
present
she
was
on
hand
twice
a
week
and
in
the
near
future
she
was
to
be
there
still
more
frequently
every
kind
of
endeavor
whether
it
involves
the
politics
of
a
ward
the
finances
of
a
bank
or
the
of
a
church
social
falls
in
the
end
on
the
shoulders
of
two
or
three
people
and
jane
undertaking
was
no
exception
and
as
it
became
more
a
matter
of
personal
endeavor
it
became
at
the
same
time
more
a
matter
of
personal
pride
she
frequently
asked
people
to
call
and
inspect
it
and
she
was
coming
more
and
more
to
feel
that
if
the
line
of
natural
evolution
were
followed
out
then
her
own
for
girls
would
be
developed
into
a
home
for
by
her
father
there
poppy
she
said
to
him
one
evening
as
she
put
several
sheets
of
paper
into
his
hands
that
my
notion
of
what
could
be
done
on
a
lot
i
have
drawn
the
front
yet
but
here
the
plan
for
and
another
for
one
of
the
upper
floors
the
germ
of
jane
unexpected
architectural
facility
was
to
be
found
perhaps
in
susan
bates
drawings
and
it
had
developed
during
her
long
labors
on
those
big
brown
sheets
which
bingham
young
man
had
brought
so
many
times
both
to
house
and
store
but
if
you
really
want
some
notion
of
the
front
she
went
on
i
can
give
it
to
you
fast
enough
she
turned
over
one
of
her
sheets
and
began
to
draw
on
the
back
of
it
pooh
architecture
easy
enough
it
be
about
five
stories
high
she
sketched
the
five
stories
with
five
or
six
lines
in
red
brick
romanesque
style
like
this
she
gave
a
broad
sweep
with
the
pencil
grouping
several
rapidly
evolved
windows
under
a
wide
round
arch
and
the
cornice
will
be
brick
and
no
galvanized
iron
i
will
not
have
and
a
terracotta
panel
here
over
the
doorway
to
tell
who
we
are
like
that
she
outlined
a
large
oblong
and
filled
it
with
an
indefinite
jumble
of
her
father
looked
at
the
drawing
and
laid
it
back
on
the
table
with
a
wan
and
patient
smile
some
other
time
jennie
we
think
about
it
when
we
have
got
so
many
other
things
on
hand
is
the
new
house
enough
for
now
jane
studied
her
father
face
for
a
moment
and
then
thrust
the
drawings
aside
with
a
sudden
and
remorseful
sweep
for
he
looked
tired
and
worn
and
in
the
slight
pallor
of
his
face
she
noted
the
deepening
of
old
wrinkles
and
the
appearance
of
new
ones
you
poor
old
pa
she
cried
i
did
mean
to
worry
you
it
can
wait
of
course
and
the
more
we
learn
about
building
in
the
meanwhile
the
better
we
shall
be
prepared
for
this
when
the
time
comes
round
she
looked
into
his
eyes
they
seemed
to
her
both
haggard
and
appealing
i
declare
you
look
just
dragged
out
poor
pal
just
bother
bother
bother
something
at
the
store
there
always
something
at
the
store
he
said
looking
away
i
have
been
feeling
very
well
all
day
i
guess
i
did
get
my
full
share
of
sleep
last
night
yes
there
was
always
something
at
the
store
and
this
time
it
was
an
affair
between
belden
and
the
south
town
assessor
belden
largely
on
his
own
account
certainly
without
anything
like
a
consultation
had
undertaken
to
secure
a
revaluation
of
the
warehouse
property
and
he
had
been
so
successful
through
the
use
of
arguments
by
which
an
assessor
may
be
moved
as
to
get
a
figure
even
lower
than
that
of
the
previous
year
despite
the
increased
value
of
the
building
unfortunately
he
had
selected
the
very
time
when
the
scandalous
inequality
in
assessments
was
engaging
the
attention
of
an
ambitious
evening
paper
and
this
paper
had
just
printed
a
cut
of
the
enlarged
building
in
juxtaposition
to
some
small
retail
grocery
in
a
remote
ward
and
precinct
which
was
assessed
in
a
ratio
ten
times
as
great
a
vivid
illustration
of
the
manner
in
which
the
rich
were
favored
at
the
expense
of
the
poor
marshall
felt
himself
put
forward
as
a
criminal
a
malefactor
he
was
assured
furthermore
that
a
man
who
offered
a
bribe
was
worse
than
the
man
who
accepted
it
he
might
have
added
too
that
belden
was
showing
some
disposition
to
divert
the
house
from
its
old
conservative
paths
into
the
wild
courses
of
speculation
his
dash
and
daring
found
an
outlet
in
an
endeavor
to
manipulate
the
tea
market
with
less
eye
perhaps
to
profit
than
to
prestige
to
primacy
in
the
trade
the
old
man
had
given
but
a
assent
he
felt
the
credit
if
any
were
involved
would
outrun
the
profit
and
that
the
promise
of
profit
was
too
little
to
justify
all
the
worry
and
care
nor
was
jane
own
enterprise
meanwhile
wholly
free
from
difficulties
there
were
distinctly
days
when
the
postponement
of
the
millennium
seemed
indefinite
when
there
appeared
to
be
enough
human
nature
remaining
in
the
world
to
secure
the
present
state
of
things
for
many
years
to
come
it
a
good
deal
more
complicated
than
i
thought
she
confessed
to
her
aunt
lydia
upon
calling
one
day
to
invite
her
to
visit
the
institution
and
to
inspect
its
workings
now
miss
casey
and
miss
erlanger
for
example
get
along
together
all
right
because
miss
casey
is
the
cashier
in
an
insurance
office
and
miss
erlanger
is
the
stenographer
for
a
railroad
president
both
of
them
kind
of
edge
off
from
some
of
the
salesladies
and
the
salesladies
are
pretty
nearly
as
bad
among
themselves
miss
maddox
who
sells
gloves
on
the
first
floor
of
bernstein
bazaar
never
quite
wants
to
sit
at
the
same
table
with
miss
slopinka
who
sells
bolts
and
padlocks
in
the
basement
so
we
have
to
trim
and
fuss
and
compromise
all
the
time
in
fact
we
been
obliged
to
take
in
another
room
or
two
however
that
makes
all
the
more
to
see
jane
then
added
a
few
words
to
cover
what
she
conceived
to
be
the
etiquette
of
such
a
call
aunt
lydia
was
not
one
of
the
kind
to
find
any
force
in
a
delicate
intimation
so
jane
said
what
she
had
to
say
as
plainly
and
pointedly
as
possible
do
call
during
the
rush
you
only
be
in
the
way
and
do
look
at
the
girls
as
if
they
were
natural
history
specimens
in
glass
cases
and
do
whatever
else
you
do
be
flip
flip
what
a
word
where
did
you
get
it
there
and
gushing
and
effusive
and
as
condescending
as
if
you
had
come
down
sixteen
pairs
of
stairs
i
lost
three
girls
the
day
after
bates
brought
cecilia
ingles
up
did
you
do
it
i
asked
her
want
her
to
see
things
she
told
me
want
to
make
a
good
earnest
woman
of
her
i
hope
she
wo
do
it
again
i
encourage
many
visitors
after
this
i
do
think
it
helps
a
place
like
that
to
be
made
into
a
show
well
i
do
know
returned
her
aunt
would
it
be
a
good
idea
to
have
entertainments
and
things
to
bring
the
different
sections
of
society
together
i
should
be
very
glad
to
help
she
added
as
she
debated
the
probable
participation
of
susan
bates
and
cecilia
ingles
no
i
not
going
to
have
any
picnic
business
returned
jane
all
nonsense
i
going
to
keep
this
thing
within
its
own
lines
i
suppose
i
could
bring
bertie
with
me
suggested
the
chastened
lydia
she
thinks
you
a
perfect
little
tin
on
wheels
yes
said
jane
she
can
come
only
do
bring
a
whole
raft
with
her
i
wo
rhodes
reassured
her
only
one
more
besides
you
would
mind
a
third
no
i
should
mind
just
one
then
lydia
rhodes
made
an
immediate
request
of
truesdale
to
act
as
escort
was
her
third
she
took
in
this
malapropos
manoeuvre
the
same
delight
that
a
child
experiences
through
the
consciousness
of
being
engaged
in
some
mischievous
wrong
lunch
with
us
at
fields
she
directed
him
and
then
we
shall
get
around
in
time
to
see
jane
wiping
off
her
tables
and
putting
away
her
crockery
we
go
very
simply
we
wear
sackcloth
and
ashes
as
for
the
portrait
that
can
wait
a
day
or
two
then
she
told
bertie
very
solemnly
that
they
were
to
begin
a
study
of
the
philanthropies
of
a
great
city
but
bertie
took
her
own
view
of
the
expedition
truesdale
participation
made
it
seem
rather
like
an
excursion
into
now
more
than
ever
was
she
under
the
glamour
of
this
young
man
accomplishments
now
more
than
ever
did
she
feel
the
embellishing
and
decorative
qualities
of
his
presence
not
only
had
she
heard
the
composer
sing
his
own
songs
she
had
lately
seen
him
paint
his
own
picture
and
hers
why
ca
you
do
a
little
or
something
of
bertie
his
aunt
had
suggested
to
him
one
day
upon
encountering
him
in
an
attitude
of
graceful
negligence
before
the
exposition
of
his
own
pictures
it
would
please
her
so
much
do
you
know
lowering
her
voice
as
she
looked
towards
the
girl
over
her
shoulder
the
dear
child
has
been
down
here
eight
or
ten
times
to
see
these
things
fancy
how
much
it
would
please
her
to
watch
you
actually
at
work
on
a
portrait
of
herself
too
truesdale
glanced
sidewise
towards
bertie
who
stood
in
painstaking
scrutiny
before
one
of
the
outlying
pictures
of
his
group
a
pair
of
art
students
in
their
careless
working
clothes
stood
a
little
apart
with
their
eyes
on
the
same
work
terrible
knowing
ai
it
remarked
one
yep
rejoined
the
other
awful
lot
of
snap
just
knocks
it
right
out
does
it
fearfully
up
to
date
ai
it
does
need
any
on
it
full
of
jump
why
ca
we
fellows
here
at
home
get
more
of
that
sort
of
thing
bertie
heart
swelled
proudly
as
she
heard
this
jargon
it
was
quite
unintelligible
to
her
but
she
felt
sure
it
conveyed
extreme
approval
she
turned
to
look
at
truesdale
just
as
he
turned
to
look
at
her
he
shook
his
head
in
burlesque
deprecation
of
her
too
obvious
appreciation
and
then
brought
his
attention
back
to
his
aunt
all
right
he
said
i
do
it
i
come
down
some
day
and
paint
her
or
you
or
the
front
doors
or
anything
else
you
say
he
pondered
for
a
moment
as
he
edged
away
a
little
from
bertie
and
tried
to
carry
his
aunt
with
him
i
suppose
i
shall
be
expected
to
look
the
part
yes
she
responded
sympathetically
bertie
has
never
seen
an
artist
of
course
but
she
has
her
ideas
of
how
one
would
look
if
it
would
be
too
much
trouble
for
you
to
oh
i
do
mind
the
trouble
so
very
much
replied
truesdale
magnanimously
i
hope
i
can
put
myself
out
a
little
she
might
look
for
a
loose
red
tie
perhaps
and
a
tam
eh
and
a
velvet
coat
suggested
his
aunt
ardently
oh
bother
a
velvet
coat
that
going
a
little
far
she
would
be
more
likely
to
look
for
a
palette
and
a
why
certainly
yes
they
use
those
things
sometimes
i
wonder
if
she
would
insist
upon
an
easel
i
think
i
could
arrange
that
replied
his
aunt
she
drew
on
an
expression
of
decorous
and
pensive
sadness
and
truesdale
knew
that
she
was
mentally
detaching
her
crayon
of
the
dear
departed
from
that
elaborate
white
and
gold
apparatus
in
her
parlor
and
if
you
should
care
for
a
few
persian
rugs
hung
up
around
by
all
means
cried
truesdale
and
a
few
bedouin
rifles
and
a
few
bits
of
brasswork
from
cairo
and
a
few
scraps
of
drapery
from
bombay
or
trebizond
and
one
of
those
inlaid
turkish
tables
and
one
or
two
stacks
of
old
french
armor
i
think
with
all
that
help
i
could
do
a
or
so
you
going
to
do
her
in
oil
declared
his
aunt
stoutly
i
am
then
i
must
have
that
table
sure
and
a
nargileh
and
a
dozen
japanese
swords
if
you
happen
to
have
them
about
the
place
and
what
else
oh
yes
a
small
bit
of
canvas
now
i
think
of
it
bertie
looked
round
once
more
and
divined
herself
under
discussion
she
sidled
away
past
a
long
row
of
landscapes
and
marines
and
drifted
out
into
the
hall
where
she
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
studied
the
mosaics
of
the
vestibule
below
good
little
subject
said
one
of
the
students
looking
after
her
he
ran
a
sudden
hand
upward
through
his
hair
which
had
lately
fallen
from
its
high
estate
and
had
come
to
look
like
the
hair
of
anybody
else
get
that
profile
against
a
red
plush
curtain
and
drape
her
in
a
red
silk
kimono
or
something
and
have
a
vase
of
jacqueminots
to
one
side
a
study
in
reds
you
know
yes
i
know
you
know
he
turned
on
his
heel
well
this
ai
work
or
anything
like
it
come
along
and
they
went
through
the
main
hallway
lydia
rhodes
followed
her
protegee
with
a
fond
eye
you
know
truesdale
that
she
just
the
sweetest
little
thing
in
the
world
oh
yes
i
know
why
do
you
go
into
the
business
asked
his
aunt
impulsively
as
she
placed
a
cajoling
hand
upon
his
arm
the
business
so
i
might
well
you
may
pay
me
a
hundred
dollars
for
this
commission
if
you
like
you
know
what
i
mean
your
father
business
now
that
they
are
making
it
all
over
they
might
easily
find
a
place
for
you
um
observed
truesdale
falling
into
a
gloomy
and
chilling
reserve
his
aunt
saw
the
necessity
of
abandoning
this
new
ground
at
once
take
pains
wo
you
she
said
struggling
back
to
her
former
position
you
make
it
as
nice
as
you
can
well
it
will
be
a
sort
of
sketch
of
course
said
truesdale
still
rather
coldly
it
wo
either
insisted
his
aunt
it
will
be
a
real
regular
picture
she
get
tired
of
it
do
you
think
it
any
fun
to
pose
tired
said
his
aunt
scornfully
she
thrust
the
supposition
into
the
outer
darkness
and
slammed
the
door
behind
it
how
are
you
going
to
dress
her
she
asked
passing
on
with
a
resolute
swiftness
to
detail
if
you
want
anything
of
mine
i
got
a
lovely
breadth
of
old
gold
satin
and
then
there
are
those
roman
pearls
you
brought
me
dress
her
i
dress
her
at
all
i
do
believe
i
shall
want
any
of
your
rugs
either
if
they
are
on
the
floor
keep
them
there
where
they
belong
no
i
shall
just
put
her
before
a
plain
wall
in
her
clothes
the
black
hat
and
jacket
she
wearing
now
wo
that
do
well
enough
we
ell
said
his
aunt
doubtfully
truesdale
had
juggled
enough
in
his
time
with
draperies
and
accessories
to
know
how
to
employ
them
here
if
so
minded
but
he
felt
instinctively
that
any
such
manipulations
would
now
be
quite
out
of
place
she
a
good
sincere
simple
little
thing
he
said
to
himself
and
she
will
speak
better
for
herself
than
all
those
things
could
speak
for
her
i
shall
make
just
a
sketch
but
a
careful
one
i
shall
do
the
best
i
can
i
shall
make
a
very
thing
of
it
suddenly
he
flushed
i
shall
tear
those
old
things
up
they
got
to
go
sometime
he
was
thinking
of
certain
studies
at
the
back
of
one
of
his
portfolios
they
were
ladylike
those
models
he
muttered
in
a
tone
at
once
of
objurgation
and
of
truesdale
came
for
the
first
sitting
in
a
costume
discreetly
picturesque
and
his
aunt
frisked
through
all
the
preliminary
preparations
in
a
state
of
great
glee
bertie
surrendered
herself
to
the
process
with
an
expression
of
wondering
her
large
dark
eyes
shone
with
a
kind
of
surprised
humility
if
she
would
look
so
much
like
one
of
murillo
madonnas
thought
truesdale
this
is
really
the
most
important
thing
that
has
ever
happened
in
the
universe
after
all
then
he
sighed
lightly
still
i
suppose
she
a
good
deal
nearer
to
a
madonna
than
i
am
to
a
murillo
rhodes
seemed
to
feel
the
necessity
of
upsetting
the
whole
apartment
she
had
the
inside
man
bring
up
the
stepladder
what
this
for
truesdale
asked
to
fix
the
curtains
right
i
can
have
them
taken
down
if
you
say
how
far
up
do
you
want
the
shades
are
those
lambrequins
in
the
way
good
heavens
cried
truesdale
do
you
want
to
tear
the
house
down
do
you
think
i
am
raphael
painting
the
pope
but
all
this
was
only
his
aunt
way
of
flattering
him
into
a
and
of
making
him
share
her
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
occasion
as
the
work
went
on
however
his
aunt
song
changed
imperceptibly
from
allegretto
to
adagio
and
from
the
major
mode
to
the
minor
the
change
first
appeared
as
she
studied
his
charcoal
outline
well
she
observed
i
think
you
might
have
put
bertie
somewhere
near
the
middle
of
the
picture
instead
of
away
off
to
the
left
like
that
they
put
them
in
the
middle
sometimes
yes
admitted
truesdale
cheerily
waving
his
aunt
back
i
leaving
the
other
side
for
you
he
added
with
a
genial
impudence
oh
that
it
is
it
and
she
half
believed
it
true
on
the
day
following
she
was
distinctly
mournful
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
can
ever
work
over
that
mass
of
red
and
blue
and
yellow
freckles
into
anything
resembling
bertie
complexion
such
a
beautiful
one
too
bertie
blushed
there
look
at
it
now
cried
his
aunt
with
a
mounting
enthusiasm
and
bertie
blushed
still
more
violently
truesdale
gave
her
a
brief
glance
which
he
at
once
transferred
to
his
palette
this
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
ever
lowered
his
eyes
from
a
woman
face
merely
because
there
happened
to
be
a
blush
upon
it
work
it
over
he
presently
inquired
as
he
looked
up
to
his
aunt
across
his
shoulder
i
never
work
anything
over
is
it
going
to
stay
that
way
demanded
his
aunt
peremptorily
own
face
was
overcast
with
an
expression
of
plaintive
distrust
of
course
it
is
i
work
in
the
primary
colors
if
you
should
prefer
something
a
little
less
advanced
he
waved
his
maulstick
vaguely
as
if
in
reference
to
the
professorial
practice
of
munich
or
to
the
antediluvian
school
of
england
well
if
that
the
way
it
going
to
stay
commented
his
aunt
with
her
face
close
to
the
canvas
my
dear
aunt
protested
truesdale
we
do
look
at
a
painting
with
our
noses
but
with
our
eyes
i
decompose
what
is
before
me
into
the
primary
colors
now
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
step
back
ten
or
twelve
feet
and
recompose
them
that
armchair
over
there
is
just
about
your
point
of
view
precisely
and
so
inviting
and
comfortable
try
it
his
aunt
removed
herself
to
the
point
suggested
well
perhaps
it
look
a
little
better
from
here
and
bertie
patterson
breathed
a
tiny
sigh
of
relief
for
the
last
thing
in
the
world
she
wished
to
be
was
a
witness
to
her
young
artist
failure
of
course
responded
truesdale
he
gave
an
invocatory
sweep
with
his
brush
and
the
spirit
of
complete
modernity
descended
and
perched
upon
the
top
of
his
easel
just
wait
it
will
be
so
na√Øve
it
will
seem
so
improvised
so
spontaneous
a
regular
little
impromptu
of
course
but
the
next
day
his
aunt
accompanied
him
to
the
front
door
when
he
took
his
leave
her
tone
was
one
of
protest
now
truesdale
this
has
gone
far
enough
you
may
muss
up
the
house
as
much
as
you
like
but
i
ca
let
you
make
a
of
bertie
when
it
comes
to
streaks
of
green
under
her
chin
and
purple
shadows
under
her
hair
i
i
do
think
it
is
right
and
she
she
admires
you
so
much
his
aunt
voice
broke
and
she
seemed
at
no
great
remove
from
tears
dear
aunt
lyddy
returned
truesdale
with
an
unruffled
imperturbability
and
an
exhaustless
and
patronizing
patience
you
have
never
learned
to
use
your
eyes
you
do
know
how
to
see
did
you
ever
try
looking
at
things
from
under
your
elbow
he
raised
his
own
as
he
fastened
the
last
button
of
his
glove
and
gave
her
a
teasing
glance
from
beneath
his
arm
you
are
quite
transfigured
he
declared
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
try
it
some
time
well
he
gave
her
his
hand
without
lowering
his
elbow
and
then
sauntered
complacently
down
the
front
steps
bertie
watched
him
from
behind
the
curtains
of
the
front
window
he
wore
a
black
which
swung
gracefully
as
he
moved
along
and
a
soft
fedora
hat
with
a
brave
dent
in
the
crown
the
most
becoming
thing
he
could
possibly
have
picked
out
she
thought
rhodes
came
back
to
take
one
more
look
at
the
canvas
it
a
perfect
living
picture
of
you
bertie
except
for
the
color
i
ca
get
around
that
she
leaned
forward
and
twisted
her
neck
round
and
looked
at
bertie
from
under
her
elbow
and
then
looked
again
at
the
canvas
and
shook
her
head
and
as
for
na√Øvete
from
truesdale
she
murmured
she
would
as
soon
have
looked
for
sunbeams
from
cucumbers
bertie
intent
upon
the
painting
saw
nothing
of
these
manoeuvres
i
guess
it
will
come
out
all
right
she
said
with
a
reviving
trust
xv
when
jane
looked
up
at
the
stroke
of
one
and
saw
her
aunt
lydia
and
bertie
patterson
enter
under
the
escort
of
truesdale
she
was
not
completely
pleased
her
rooms
were
no
place
for
men
anyway
especially
young
ones
and
she
had
often
wished
that
truesdale
however
worthy
her
admiration
and
the
world
were
a
little
less
ready
as
to
bringing
his
fascinations
into
play
if
ever
he
comes
down
here
she
thought
wear
something
too
striking
and
he
want
to
talk
to
the
girls
about
the
continued
stones
in
the
magazines
or
play
the
piano
or
something
and
they
think
he
trying
to
flirt
with
them
i
hate
anything
of
that
kind
here
said
jane
virtuously
truesdale
however
conducted
himself
with
an
immense
discretion
and
wore
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
his
hats
and
shoes
were
now
quite
like
those
of
other
people
his
florentine
had
drawn
so
much
attention
in
the
that
he
had
been
obliged
to
give
them
up
and
as
for
the
high
silk
hat
which
he
had
brought
home
from
the
boulevard
michel
he
had
had
to
leave
off
after
a
second
trial
there
were
some
things
he
found
that
people
would
not
stand
and
his
manner
was
utterly
stripped
of
gallantry
it
was
gauged
with
the
precise
idea
of
meeting
the
approval
of
bertie
patterson
i
expect
i
shall
seem
awfully
insipid
he
said
to
himself
jane
came
to
meet
them
from
a
room
beyond
where
she
left
a
doughnut
and
a
half
cup
of
coffee
standing
on
a
oak
table
the
regular
noon
hour
enjoyed
by
most
of
the
girls
was
done
two
or
three
remained
finishing
their
lunch
or
looking
over
the
picture
papers
and
a
couple
of
them
in
the
little
parlor
were
trying
duets
on
the
piano
i
the
only
one
of
the
board
on
hand
jane
explained
so
been
doing
a
little
and
a
little
waiting
and
a
little
everything
this
is
miss
casey
she
said
introducing
one
of
the
and
this
is
miss
introducing
the
other
miss
casey
and
miss
bowed
and
smiled
and
made
a
dexterous
remark
apiece
without
too
apparent
an
effort
and
presently
took
an
adroit
departure
they
had
already
overrun
their
time
they
explained
walk
around
and
look
at
things
suggested
jane
we
pretty
high
up
you
see
but
we
do
save
any
rent
because
the
elevators
make
one
floor
worth
as
much
as
another
still
the
light
good
and
the
air
and
there
a
great
deal
less
noise
the
others
followed
jane
lead
with
much
docility
truesdale
was
profoundly
impressed
by
his
sister
aspect
under
these
novel
conditions
bertie
patterson
seemed
to
find
in
her
the
incarnation
of
all
the
philanthropy
even
aunt
lydia
was
almost
too
deeply
affected
to
chirp
and
chatter
with
her
wonted
volubility
here
the
office
said
jane
leading
them
into
a
small
lighted
closet
to
one
side
this
book
is
for
our
account
with
the
butcher
and
that
one
is
for
our
account
with
the
baker
our
supplies
are
brought
up
on
the
freight
elevator
every
morning
come
and
see
the
where
we
cook
eggs
as
they
passed
through
the
adjoining
room
a
girl
sat
at
one
of
the
tables
with
a
piece
of
pie
and
a
cup
of
tea
she
was
turning
the
leaves
of
one
of
the
comic
weeklies
and
a
slight
frown
of
intentness
upon
her
face
indicated
either
a
limited
sense
of
humor
or
some
unfamiliarity
with
the
subjects
under
review
the
latter
perhaps
her
face
and
air
were
distinctly
foreign
poor
sophie
said
jane
indulgently
she
trying
her
english
on
those
jokes
she
improving
however
and
she
can
speak
french
and
german
like
a
i
guess
she
smart
enough
anyway
she
looks
so
the
girl
seemed
of
a
type
that
might
have
come
from
baden
or
alsace
or
the
frontier
she
had
a
high
color
and
an
abundance
of
black
hair
her
eyes
as
she
lifted
them
to
bertie
patterson
were
dark
and
narrow
and
full
of
sparkle
and
decision
and
the
which
still
survived
from
her
study
of
the
comic
paper
helped
to
give
her
a
look
of
some
force
and
determination
truesdale
on
seeing
her
gave
a
sudden
start
and
turned
his
eyes
and
his
face
away
at
once
then
with
a
quickened
pace
he
followed
his
sister
lead
towards
the
kitchen
and
pantry
he
smiled
half
grimly
such
a
thing
may
happen
anywhere
of
course
he
said
to
himself
but
i
should
have
chosen
it
to
happen
right
here
no
not
exactly
bertie
and
rhodes
followed
after
to
see
the
that
cooked
eggs
as
they
crossed
the
threshold
truesdale
looked
back
between
them
towards
the
subject
of
his
speculation
she
had
grasped
her
paper
firmly
with
both
fists
and
now
sat
with
an
intent
stare
fixed
on
its
pages
she
neither
raised
nor
lowered
her
head
nor
could
he
observe
that
she
looked
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
ouf
said
truesdale
as
jane
lit
up
the
stove
you
never
know
when
a
thing
is
at
an
end
jane
presently
turned
off
her
you
can
go
back
through
the
other
room
it
is
quite
so
swell
she
expounded
as
she
moved
along
but
we
have
several
grades
of
girls
and
each
one
finds
her
own
level
and
her
own
society
for
herself
she
led
the
way
back
into
the
parlor
and
drew
a
finger
along
the
of
the
piano
as
she
passed
by
anybody
who
wants
to
send
a
few
new
pieces
of
lively
music
may
do
so
two
or
three
late
lunchers
had
come
in
and
were
clattering
their
knives
and
forks
at
the
table
opposite
the
girl
whom
jane
had
called
sophie
sophie
still
sat
in
her
place
she
held
her
paper
with
a
firm
hand
and
turned
the
leaves
at
intervals
she
looked
up
once
as
the
party
was
passing
out
truesdale
stepped
over
the
rapidly
on
the
far
side
of
jane
and
bertie
and
rhodes
he
dropped
his
glove
that
he
might
stoop
for
it
and
as
he
stooped
he
shot
a
rapid
glance
through
the
narrow
door
of
the
other
room
the
girl
still
held
her
paper
before
her
face
but
she
sent
a
single
look
after
the
party
athwart
its
side
truesdale
stepped
into
the
hall
and
pressed
the
button
of
the
elevator
it

true
enough
not
a
bit
of
doubt
about
it
if
she
recognize
me
just
now
she
never
have
i
another
chance
to
here
he
handed
his
charges
into
the
elevator
well
what
do
you
think
of
jane
and
her
doings
now
he
asked
briskly
as
he
stepped
in
after
them
can
you
think
of
any
better
opening
for
the
investment
of
your
idle
funds
is
she
an
able
financier
has
she
got
a
great
administrative
capacity
is
she
one
of
the
rising
young
men
of
the
day
as
he
flung
off
this
string
of
stock
phrases
from
the
newspapers
his
eyes
flashed
brightly
a
mounting
color
came
into
his
cheeks
and
a
triumphant
smile
to
his
lips
and
a
caressing
and
ringing
vibration
into
his
voice
he
seemed
to
coruscate
with
all
the
conquering
insolence
of
youth
bertie
patterson
had
never
seen
him
quite
so
handsome
down
we
go
he
cried
to
his
aunt
as
the
cab
resumed
its
course
with
a
sudden
drop
no
do
catch
hold
of
me
i
only
a
broken
reed
yes
try
the
much
more
satisfactory
but
look
out
for
your
fingers
never
get
your
fingers
caught
then
as
they
arrived
at
the
street
level
wait
a
second
do
hurry
be
sure
of
your
footing
do
stumble
and
break
your
neck
at
the
last
minute
one
poor
last
little
chance
after
so
many
glorious
opportunities
have
gone
by
truesdale
whispered
his
aunt
for
there
were
other
people
in
the
elevator
and
they
looked
askance
at
this
smart
volley
of
verbal
superfluities
he
led
them
out
to
the
carriage
here
we
are
on
solid
ground
once
more
he
continued
best
place
in
the
world
to
be
no
do
ask
me
to
get
in
i
walk
on
a
bit
i
would
leave
terra
firma
now
for
anything
he
handed
his
aunt
in
and
then
bertie
he
exacted
from
bertie
a
perfectly
superfluous
shake
of
the
hand
bowed
over
that
hand
with
a
sudden
access
of
gravity
and
lost
himself
in
an
abysmal
reverie
before
he
had
traversed
a
hundred
yards
he
saw
before
him
a
assemblage
of
roofs
and
above
them
rose
the
fretwork
of
a
soaring
gothic
spire
a
narrow
river
half
encircled
the
town
and
a
battered
old
bridge
guarded
by
a
gateway
led
out
into
the
open
country
towards
a
horizon
bounded
by
a
low
range
of
blue
hills
rang
out
from
distant
and
troops
of
dragoons
clattered
noisily
over
the
rough
pavement
of
the
great
square
the
dragoons
passed
and
a
colony
of
awnings
and
umbrellas
sprang
up
in
their
place
and
bands
of
stocky
peasantry
chattered
and
chaffered
and
left
the
pavement
strewn
with
the
loose
leaves
of
cabbages
and
then
night
came
and
blotted
these
out
and
the
moon
rose
and
music
played
and
throngs
of
officers
and
students
and
sat
through
a
evening
before
the
high
towards
the
stars
towered
the
columns
and
pediments
of
a
vast
official
structure
whose
broken
sawed
the
heavens
and
whose
varied
cornices
and
ledges
were
disjointed
by
deep
and
perplexing
shadows
on
each
side
of
the
great
portal
which
opened
through
the
pillared
arcade
there
was
stationed
a
mounted
cuirassier
and
above
it
there
appeared
in
large
letters
marshall
belden
said
truesdale
suddenly
emerging
from
his
reverie
he
sprang
lightly
over
the
muddy
gutter
and
found
a
foothold
on
the
damp
flagging
pshaw
he
said
rather
ruefully
in
a
moment
more
she
would
have
come
to
meet
me
he
looked
up
at
the
building
before
him
well
really
they
made
quite
a
decent
affair
of
it
but
what
are
they
doing
to
the
sign
oh
i
see
putting
to
the
front
of
it
and
to
the
back
that
ladder
looks
rather
shaky
the
marshall
belden
perhaps
it
would
be
civil
of
me
to
call
on
the
new
concern
seeing
that
i
have
chanced
their
way
truesdale
picked
his
way
choicely
through
the
office
with
the
urbane
affectation
of
never
having
seen
the
place
before
one
or
two
of
the
clerks
recognized
him
and
a
hurried
word
passed
from
desk
to
desk
effected
an
immediate
establishment
of
his
identity
throughout
the
room
those
who
had
never
seen
him
had
at
least
heard
about
him
some
of
them
had
visited
his
pictures
at
the
art
institute
and
as
devotees
of
the
old
school
if
of
any
had
mildly
guyed
them
others
had
read
paragraphs
in
the
chappie
chat
of
the
newspapers
about
his
trousers
and
cravats
those
genial
paragraphs
which
may
so
easily
endow
a
young
man
of
parts
and
peculiarities
with
a
one
of
them
now
smiled
broadly
and
another
so
far
forgot
himself
and
his
dignity
as
to
wink
but
all
the
rest
as
american
freemen
by
birth
or
adoption
united
in
a
stolid
determination
to
refrain
from
seeing
or
at
least
from
acknowledging
any
distinguishing
peculiarity
any
differentiation
above
all
any
savor
of
superiority
the
one
of
whom
truesdale
inquired
for
his
father
was
so
spartan
in
his
brusqueness
that
truesdale
despite
himself
smiled
in
his
face
in
the
private
office
he
found
his
father
closeted
with
roger
crumpled
and
trampled
on
the
floor
and
with
the
effect
of
a
matter
abandoned
or
at
least
superseded
lay
a
large
sheet
of
paper
printed
with
the
outlines
of
a
subdivision
while
a
hundred
similar
sheets
rested
in
a
roll
on
the
end
of
the
old
man
desk
marshall
himself
lay
back
in
his
chair
with
marks
of
the
exhaustion
that
follows
intense
indignation
and
exasperation
while
roger
paced
the
floor
with
all
the
vehemence
and
choler
of
younger
blood
yes
roger
was
saying
explosively
the
bond
was
opened
and
all
they
found
was
a
blank
paper
the
alderman
name
and
nothing
more
why
do
you
blame
what
more
can
do
what
more
could
you
do
what
more
could
any
decent
man
do
and
if
you
wanted
to
find
out
how
things
are
run
here
you
doing
it
what
the
trouble
asked
truesdale
he
sat
down
with
an
engaging
disposition
to
show
himself
interested
marshall
passed
his
hand
feebly
over
his
forehead
it
that
police
affair
of
your
mother
he
said
in
a
tired
voice
well
i
hope
those
two
scamps
have
been
sent
to
jail
or
to
bridewell
or
wherever
they
belong
august
will
carry
that
scar
to
his
dying
day
jail
cried
roger
no
need
ever
go
to
jail
they
sent
for
their
alderman
the
minute
they
were
caught
our
ward
has
elected
anything
but
for
the
last
ten
years
well
what
did
the
present
do
he
went
bail
for
them
he
made
out
the
bond
himself
inside
of
thirty
seconds
he
marked
it
so
on
the
envelope
and
the
took
it
for
what
he
called
it
so
when
these
fellows
jumped
their
bail
our
alderman
lost
his
autograph
a
bad
for
the
police
it
queried
truesdale
impartially
cried
roger
it
easy
enough
to
be
taken
in
if
you
want
to
be
taken
in
if
you
lend
yourself
to
being
taken
in
his
father
gave
a
long
sigh
and
dropped
a
helpless
hand
on
his
desk
truesdale
looked
into
vacancy
and
gave
a
long
low
whistle
and
there
you
have
it
ended
roger
you
have
lifted
off
the
cover
and
looked
in
do
you
want
to
go
deeper
you
find
a
thieves
gamblers
prostitutes
pawnbrokers
aldermen
heelers
justices
bailiffs
policemen
and
all
concocted
for
us
within
a
short
quarter
of
a
century
he
drew
his
hands
across
each
other
i
never
felt
so
cheap
and
filthy
in
my
life
truesdale
made
no
further
inquiries
about
the
van
horns
his
fastidious
nature
shrank
back
from
all
these
malodorous
actualities
he
added
his
own
footprints
to
those
which
already
defaced
the
map
lying
on
the
floor
and
asked
about
that
you
interesting
yourself
in
buying
land
i
imagine
in
selling
replied
roger
curtly
david
marshall
leaned
laboriously
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
the
intention
perhaps
of
crowding
the
crumpled
map
into
his
instead
he
gave
it
several
neat
and
careful
folds
and
thrust
it
abstractedly
into
one
of
his
it
found
place
alongside
of
a
bill
for
doctor
services
handed
in
that
morning
a
porter
who
had
fallen
down
three
floors
of
the
elevator
shaft
had
been
attended
by
one
of
his
own
friends
the
bill
was
exorbitant
everybody
concerned
knew
that
but
it
was
rather
less
than
a
probable
award
for
damages
everybody
knew
that
too
the
excess
was
to
be
shared
of
course
between
doctor
and
patient
was
there
anything
special
his
father
asked
presently
with
a
wan
and
dejected
glance
towards
his
younger
son
if
not
i
think
i
put
on
my
things
and
go
home
i
do
quite
feel
myself
today
perhaps
you
better
recommended
roger
taking
the
roll
of
maps
under
his
arm
i
have
these
distributed
from
my
office
during
the
week
no
nothing
special
answered
truesdale
i
just
happened
in
and
i
think
he
added
to
himself
that
i
had
better
lose
no
time
in
happening
out
the
idea
of
my
running
up
against
such
a
as
this
pouf
as
he
went
out
he
passed
along
the
front
of
belden
desk
belden
himself
sat
there
attended
with
the
sort
of
deferential
familiarity
that
suggests
the
confidential
clerk
by
the
swiss
the
alsacian
or
whatever
else
who
on
a
previous
occasion
had
moved
the
curiosity
of
bingham
this
man
caught
sight
of
truesdale
as
he
passed
and
gave
him
an
instant
glance
of
recognition
he
at
once
bowed
his
head
over
belden
desk
so
as
to
hide
his
face
among
its
papers
a
gentleman
to
see
you
sir
he
suggested
with
a
magnificent
readiness
belden
raised
his
own
head
and
met
the
careless
nod
of
the
passing
truesdale
with
a
forbidding
frown
no
he
does
want
to
see
me
and
i
do
want
to
see
him
he
muttered
in
a
lower
tone
you
know
him
is
it
not
so
the
man
insisted
with
a
kind
of
smothered
determination
know
him
yes
with
extreme
distaste
it
young
marshall
marshall
son
yes
belden
thrust
some
papers
towards
him
take
these
as
you
go
the
man
put
out
his
hand
i
know
him
i
myself
also
he
said
looking
belden
full
in
the
face
with
a
steady
eye
ich
selbst
he
struck
his
breast
and
ventured
on
the
liberty
of
a
smile
a
smile
slow
and
sinister
one
that
called
for
an
understanding
and
challenged
one
might
have
fancied
such
a
conjunction
effected
when
an
evening
or
two
later
truesdale
received
a
note
from
gladys
mckenna
as
he
sifted
apart
its
numerous
sheets
he
tried
to
recall
whether
he
had
replied
to
her
last
he
could
not
remember
having
done
so
but
sometimes
they
write
he
said
discontentedly
and
nothing
can
stop
them
her
pages
led
him
a
rough
and
rugged
chase
she
wrote
a
large
hasty
hand
with
an
unstinted
expenditure
of
ink
i
declare
he
said
running
several
sheets
over
in
succession
she
gets
blinder
and
blinder
the
further
along
she
goes
and
now
turning
back
to
the
beginning
see
what
it
all
about
the
letter
assumed
from
the
outset
a
mysterious
and
melodramatic
tone
perhaps
finally
she
really
has
something
to
say
commented
truesdale
but
she
went
on
circling
round
her
theme
dipping
down
to
it
now
and
again
and
then
soaring
up
and
away
from
it
altogether
well
asked
truesdale
presently
with
a
slight
show
of
impatience
what
is
it
something
she
does
fully
understand
or
something
she
does
understand
but
ca
bring
herself
to
write
about
she
she
says
to
very
small
purpose
say
i
he
felt
one
moment
that
she
was
more
or
less
in
the
dark
the
next
that
she
was
making
passes
at
some
forbidden
theme
the
third
that
she
was
asking
a
more
ardent
recognition
of
her
loyalty
and
devotion
she
speaks
of
her
too
it
seems
and
and
it
need
be
though
she
made
it
for
herself
and
she
can
unmake
it
whenever
she
chooses
well
i
try
all
this
again
when
i
got
more
time
it
will
keep
what
is
this
though
it
says
at
the
end
h
i
am
to
remember
that
if
i
have
enemies
i
also
have
fast
friends
ever
yours
sincerely
oh
all
right
he
crammed
the
sheets
into
his
drew
on
his
gloves
selected
a
stick
to
his
taste
gave
himself
a
last
look
in
the
glass
and
sauntered
out
to
dinner
he
had
discovered
a
french
restaurant
within
a
kilometre
of
the
house
where
he
could
dine
prix
in
a
for
five
francs
including
a
of
that
something
like
he
declared
that
what
i
used
to
he
thought
with
a
shudder
of
the
rest
of
the
family
going
down
to
supper
in
the
basement
that
dungeon
i
glad
i
sure
that
they
are
going
to
have
their
new
for
their
own
sakes
that
is
to
say
not
that
it
will
matter
the
least
to
xvi
truesdale
airily
waved
the
remaining
coin
from
the
plate
to
the
pocket
and
rose
to
go
he
never
omitted
the
giving
of
a
it
helps
so
much
to
increase
the
illusion
he
said
the
waiters
accordingly
bestowed
an
exaggerated
attention
upon
his
hat
and
coat
and
had
developed
an
almost
clinging
affection
for
his
stick
they
also
insisted
upon
passing
things
that
he
could
very
well
reach
for
himself
and
their
bon
soir
was
quite
unfailing
in
its
regularity
this
shaggy
town
may
have
a
silver
lining
after
all
he
would
think
but
you
got
to
turn
things
inside
out
to
find
it
near
the
exit
truesdale
noticed
theodore
brower
sitting
with
a
before
him
hallo
he
called
to
brower
i
did
know
you
came
here
once
in
a
while
returned
brower
i
shop
around
i
a
tramp
i
eat
anywhere
and
i
getting
tired
of
it
too
he
rose
give
me
a
lift
with
this
coat
and
i
go
along
with
you
brower
was
too
incorruptibly
native
to
give
a
fee
usually
therefore
he
put
on
his
coat
for
himself
well
what
the
programme
he
asked
feeling
for
his
inside
sleeves
nothing
said
truesdale
or
anything
only
i
bar
law
and
philanthropy
and
the
what
have
you
got
in
mind
yourself
i
though
of
going
up
to
the
consolation
club
this
is
their
night
sounds
sort
of
soothing
observed
truesdale
well
what
do
do
nothing
like
the
at
the
crepuscular
i
hope
are
strangers
admitted
what
do
they
do
they
try
to
show
that
the
world
is
so
bad
as
it
seems
they
let
you
in
all
right
because
i
not
so
bad
as
i
seem
thanks
they
do
have
a
dinner
i
hope
no
dinner
but
they
give
you
a
bite
later
on
do
they
i
was
almost
famished
at
the
simplicity
what
will
they
talk
about
almost
anything
you
never
can
tell
come
along
truesdale
as
an
individual
interested
brower
but
moderately
truesdale
as
brother
interested
him
extremely
you
state
your
case
that
the
idea
and
the
worse
you
make
it
the
better
the
face
they
try
to
put
on
it
do
i
well
i
do
know
that
i
a
case
and
if
i
had
i
might
prefer
to
keep
it
to
myself
however
the
consolation
club
met
in
an
upper
chamber
on
erie
street
and
carried
on
their
deliberations
under
a
large
plaster
bust
of
the
prince
of
optimists
the
patient
emerson
listened
to
the
discussion
of
many
a
burning
question
and
witnessed
the
application
of
many
an
alleviating
salve
sometimes
the
question
was
personal
they
soothed
the
who
had
been
cut
on
the
street
by
his
employer
daughter
sometimes
it
was
national
they
commiserated
the
citizen
who
had
been
intimidated
at
the
sometimes
it
was
a
question
of
right
like
a
uniform
divorce
law
sometimes
merely
a
question
of
expediency
like
the
tariff
but
principally
they
discussed
the
affairs
of
a
vast
and
sudden
municipality
they
bade
one
another
not
to
despair
after
all
either
of
the
city
or
of
the
republic
and
towards
eleven
the
priests
of
the
cult
saw
an
offering
of
and
beer
set
before
their
idol
and
presently
in
true
sacerdotal
fashion
they
fell
upon
these
viands
on
their
own
account
oh
come
said
truesdale
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
he
cast
on
brower
and
his
circle
a
look
half
of
expostulation
and
half
of
embarrassment
i
not
entitled
to
annoy
your
friends
with
any
such
filthy
trifle
as
besides
i
do
claim
it
as
any
grievance
of
he
thought
privately
that
his
mother
disposition
to
dicker
with
the
populace
was
no
more
creditable
than
necessary
he
could
take
no
great
pleasure
in
dwelling
upon
it
too
lingeringly
oh
go
ahead
urged
brower
our
fellows
here
are
interested
in
just
that
sort
of
thing
if
you
should
want
to
come
in
we
take
it
as
your
initiation
do
added
another
member
i
believe
that
for
every
one
man
who
leaves
the
with
a
waning
confidence
in
the
present
and
a
clouded
hope
for
the
future
there
are
scores
who
thus
leave
the
lower
courts
of
justice
oh
very
well
replied
truesdale
throwing
out
his
hands
in
his
light
french
fashion
and
he
recounted
the
whole
chain
of
circumstances
which
had
so
exasperated
his
father
and
baffled
his
brother
from
the
first
panting
appearance
of
frowzy
old
mother
van
horn
on
his
own
down
to
the
forfeiture
of
the
fictitious
by
her
two
grandnephews
he
gave
his
narrative
in
a
series
of
light
graphic
delicate
touches
he
almost
saw
it
print
itself
before
his
very
eyes
like
a
page
from
one
of
those
beautiful
little
volumes
made
by
hachette
or
by
lemerre
those
sprightly
broken
pages
where
a
paragraph
consists
of
a
line
or
even
a
word
where
brief
exclamatory
phrases
abound
and
where
short
rows
of
dots
leave
the
reader
to
complete
the
meaning
at
his
own
pleasure
he
even
gesticulated
a
tiny
illustration
or
two
into
the
edge
of
the
text
seldom
had
these
earnest
and
intent
young
men
heard
such
a
theme
presented
with
so
many
nods
and
becks
and
wreath√®d
smiles
it
seemed
like
the
stirring
of
a
cesspool
with
a
silver
and
what
consolation
have
you
to
offer
me
for
that
smiled
truesdale
as
he
finished
he
himself
appeared
to
share
but
slightly
the
indignation
that
his
recital
aroused
after
all
these
doings
were
alien
to
him
like
the
domestic
difficulties
that
might
be
distracting
some
in
but
on
the
others
it
produced
the
effect
that
the
recital
of
specific
injuries
always
does
and
should
this
for
example
answered
a
sardonic
young
man
whose
black
beard
showed
through
his
drawn
and
sallow
skin
that
we
are
at
last
playing
the
game
with
all
the
pieces
on
the
board
with
all
the
cards
in
the
pack
with
all
the
elements
in
other
words
of
a
vast
and
diversified
human
nature
the
simple
hopes
and
ideals
of
this
western
world
of
fifty
years
ago
even
of
twenty
years
ago
where
are
they
now
what
the
country
really
celebrated
at
philadelphia
in
however
unconsciously
as
the
ending
of
its
minority
and
the
assumption
of
full
manhood
with
all
its
perplexities
and
cares
the
broad
life
of
the
real
world
began
for
us
the
very
next
year
you
mean
with
the
railroad
riots
asked
brower
and
has
been
going
on
more
fiercely
ever
since
take
a
man
who
was
born
in
and
who
is
to
die
with
the
century
what
would
be
idea
of
life
contention
bickering
discontent
chronic
irritation
a
r√©gime
of
tempered
by
yes
said
another
as
you
say
we
have
all
the
elements
at
last
and
the
elements
of
human
nature
are
unchanging
like
the
elements
of
chemistry
and
they
combine
in
the
same
unchanging
fashions
imagine
a
reconstructed
universe
without
sulphur
or
nitrogen
or
imagine
elements
that
combine
to
one
purpose
in
this
corner
of
the
laboratory
combining
to
another
purpose
in
that
the
same
human
compounds
are
produced
through
the
ages
and
the
elements
that
follow
one
formula
in
the
old
world
will
follow
the
same
formula
in
the
new
even
if
they
break
the
crucible
a
generation
ago
we
thought
poor
pathetic
creatures
that
our
pacific
processes
showed
social
science
in
its
fullest
development
but
we
have
all
the
elements
possessed
by
the
old
world
itself
and
we
must
take
whatever
they
develop
as
the
old
world
does
we
have
the
full
working
apparatus
finally
with
all
its
resultant
noise
waste
stenches
stains
dangers
explosions
um
said
truesdale
to
whom
these
observations
sounded
disagreeably
like
oratory
how
does
all
this
bear
on
my
case
i
it
mine
to
observe
the
forms
he
added
with
a
smile
to
which
no
one
responded
i
can
tell
you
that
myself
broke
in
brower
the
last
twenty
years
have
brought
us
elements
that
have
never
been
in
our
national
life
before
a
heavy
immigration
from
southeastern
europe
for
example
the
populations
of
italy
and
poland
and
hungary
what
view
now
do
take
of
the
government
their
government
all
government
is
it
an
implacable
and
immemorial
enemy
a
great
and
cruel
and
dreadful
monster
to
be
evaded
hoodwinked
combated
stabbed
in
the
dark
if
occasion
offers
quite
right
acknowledged
truesdale
why
when
the
peasants
come
into
rome
from
the
campagna
they
always
bring
their
pitchforks
with
them
you
can
see
them
any
sunday
behind
the
capitol
they
going
to
be
murdered
or
robbed
or
imprisoned
or
something
and
when
these
people
have
been
out
of
the
government
from
generation
to
generation
and
opposed
to
it
and
mistrustful
of
it
is
it
an
easy
matter
on
their
coming
over
here
to
make
them
feel
themselves
a
part
of
it
and
to
imbue
them
with
a
loyalty
to
it
one
thing
more
broke
in
the
first
speaker
there
is
another
element
it
is
imported
from
the
nearer
half
of
europe
and
is
a
more
dangerous
element
still
i
mean
the
element
of
feudality
oh
said
truesdale
now
i
begin
to
see
the
essence
of
feudality
is
the
idea
of
personal
loyalty
now
loyalty
to
another
individual
is
a
good
thing
in
its
way
and
in
its
own
field
and
in
a
certain
measure
and
at
a
certain
juncture
but
it
is
not
the
right
prop
for
a
great
republic
that
requires
not
the
idea
of
personal
loyalty
to
some
chief
but
the
idea
of
personal
responsibility
to
a
cause
above
all
chiefs
this
takes
a
breadth
of
view
and
a
loftiness
of
ideal
that
only
one
race
in
the
world
has
ever
possessed
our
own
the
great
man
politically
is
the
man
who
can
eliminate
the
personal
element
from
a
great
cause
the
little
man
is
the
well
turning
to
truesdale
there
are
the
general
data
make
your
own
application
of
them
i
see
said
truesdale
my
people
are
naturally
against
the
governing
powers
anyway
from
instinct
and
heredity
even
when
one
of
them
does
attain
official
position
it
is
only
the
position
of
the
worm
in
the
apple
and
they
think
too
that
it
is
a
more
sane
and
practical
thing
to
help
one
another
out
of
a
tangible
difficulty
than
to
sacrifice
one
another
to
an
intangible
cause
i
never
contended
they
were
not
human
that
is
all
by
any
means
said
brower
determinedly
there
just
as
bad
behind
he
resettled
himself
in
his
chair
as
he
claimed
the
attention
of
the
room
he
seemed
to
truesdale
as
if
seating
himself
in
a
saddle
a
saddle
on
the
back
of
some
hobby
truesdale
already
heard
the
steed
pant
and
champ
this
town
of
ours
labors
under
one
peculiar
disadvantage
it
is
the
only
great
city
in
the
world
to
which
all
its
citizens
have
come
for
the
one
common
avowed
object
of
making
money
there
you
have
its
genesis
its
growth
its
end
and
object
and
there
are
but
few
of
us
who
are
not
attending
to
that
object
very
strictly
in
this
garden
city
of
ours
every
man
cultivates
his
own
little
bed
and
his
neighbor
his
but
who
looks
after
the
paths
between
they
have
become
a
kind
of
no
man
land
and
the
weeds
of
a
rank
iniquity
are
fast
choking
them
up
the
thing
to
teach
the
public
is
this
that
the
general
good
is
a
different
thing
from
the
sum
of
the
individual
goods
over
in
the
settlement
we
are
trying
to
make
those
realize
that
they
are
a
part
of
the
body
politic
perhaps
we
need
another
settlement
to
remind
some
of
the
original
of
the
same
fact
h
thought
truesdale
i
believe
brower
is
an
awfully
fine
fellow
but
if
he
keeps
up
this
kind
of
talk
all
the
time
with
jane
then
as
they
passed
out
into
the
street
a
few
minutes
later
i
just
see
where
my
consolation
comes
in
after
all
perhaps
they
thought
responded
brower
that
you
would
appreciate
the
beauty
of
consolation
until
you
had
first
appreciated
the
gravity
of
your
case
i
think
their
idea
was
less
consolation
than
instruction
ouf
said
truesdale
who
disdained
instruction
from
whatever
source
do
you
know
said
brower
at
the
first
crossing
i
going
to
talk
to
your
father
about
this
justice
business
well
rejoined
truesdale
he
listen
to
you
if
he
listen
to
anybody
but
he
awfully
sore
about
it
so
are
other
people
sore
about
it
hundreds
of
people
much
poorer
and
humbler
than
any
of
us
people
to
whom
the
miscarriage
of
justice
is
not
a
mere
matter
of
exasperation
and
annoyance
but
a
real
matter
of
life
and
death
they
want
care
and
attention
as
the
doctors
say
they
need
a
that
about
it
there
are
institutions
that
look
after
people
minds
and
bodies
gratis
i
want
to
see
an
institution
started
up
that
will
do
as
much
for
their
estates
i
want
to
see
a
building
for
it
with
an
endowment
and
a
library
and
a
force
of
practitioners
to
think
of
all
the
things
that
a
man
with
money
and
ideas
and
sympathies
might
do
and
should
do
in
a
town
like
this
you
might
try
him
said
truesdale
doubtfully
but
i
think
jane
has
got
the
inside
track
you
heard
about
her
home
i
suppose
and
seen
the
plans
for
it
i
should
to
put
up
an
architectural
monument
in
such
a
ghastly
town
as
this
i
should
as
soon
think
of
ramming
an
angel
into
a
yes
brower
knew
all
about
jane
home
much
more
than
truesdale
did
in
fact
but
this
did
not
prevent
him
from
asking
for
all
manner
of
information
about
the
project
he
did
this
purely
for
the
pleasure
of
talking
about
jane
herself
and
he
wondered
time
and
time
again
whether
he
had
not
betrayed
to
jane
brother
the
particular
kind
of
interest
he
was
developing
in
her
he
felt
that
his
beard
offered
but
a
slight
concealment
to
the
nervous
twitching
of
his
mouth
and
that
despite
the
muffling
of
his
heavy
overcoat
the
throbbings
of
his
heart
must
be
as
perceptible
to
truesdale
as
to
himself
and
when
truesdale
presently
made
the
ungrudging
avowal
that
jane
was
a
pretty
good
sort
of
girl
after
all
the
plus
of
a
brother
praise
brower
was
driven
to
thrust
a
trembling
hand
inside
his
coat
to
reduce
his
thumping
organ
to
something
like
subjection
his
admiration
for
jane
had
been
based
originally
on
her
essential
qualities
certainly
he
had
received
no
quickening
impulse
at
the
beginning
from
a
contemplation
of
her
mere
exterior
he
had
looked
upon
her
as
a
valuable
text
put
at
a
disadvantage
by
an
unprepossessing
binding
but
now
there
came
the
issue
of
a
new
edition
in
a
tastefully
designed
cover
with
additions
and
corrections
with
extra
illustrations
too
illustrations
of
a
startling
social
aptitude
and
with
even
a
hint
of
illumination
the
illumination
that
comes
from
the
consciousness
of
a
noble
purpose
brower
now
began
to
feel
with
a
rising
pride
and
pleasure
that
jane
was
at
last
doing
herself
the
fullest
justice
jane
in
the
meanwhile
with
no
thought
of
a
possible
competition
between
rival
collectors
for
a
certain
rare
old
volume
was
helping
tom
bingham
to
build
the
new
house
she
went
out
southward
two
or
three
times
a
week
and
carried
a
with
her
as
she
once
explained
it
to
bingham
you
ca
be
too
sure
of
having
things
right
at
the
start
so
she
measured
the
foundations
with
her
when
the
distances
were
short
and
paced
them
off
when
they
were
long
she
kept
a
close
eye
on
the
work
through
each
advancing
stage
and
saw
that
it
was
good
one
sunday
morning
in
jane
took
the
one
of
those
leisurely
green
ones
that
run
to
the
old
people
home
and
went
out
to
satisfy
herself
that
the
first
courses
of
dressed
stone
were
going
into
place
as
they
should
may
was
speaking
truly
in
the
mildness
and
freshness
of
the
air
in
the
slow
passing
of
the
light
and
expansive
cumuli
across
the
wide
blueness
of
the
sky
in
the
grasses
and
dandelions
springing
up
among
the
stark
weeds
of
last
year
that
swayed
and
rustled
on
every
vacant
lot
from
her
among
the
heaps
of
brick
and
sand
and
yellow
lumber
that
surrounded
the
site
of
the
new
house
jane
saw
the
fronts
or
sides
or
backs
of
other
new
houses
placed
dispersedly
round
about
their
towers
and
turrets
and
porches
and
oriels
and
the
myriad
other
massive
manifestations
proper
to
the
new
stone
age
between
them
and
beyond
them
her
eye
took
transversely
the
unkempt
prairie
as
it
lay
cut
up
by
sketchy
streets
and
alleys
and
traversed
by
tracks
and
rows
of
and
long
lines
of
telegraph
poles
and
the
gaunt
framework
of
an
elevated
road
in
one
direction
she
saw
above
the
dead
crop
of
rustling
weeds
the
heads
of
a
long
line
of
people
on
their
way
to
church
in
the
other
direction
the
distant
clang
of
a
passing
gong
drew
her
eye
to
the
vast
advertisement
which
glared
in
the
sun
from
the
flank
of
an
outlying
i
hope
the
next
man
who
builds
will
shut
out
she
thought
presently
a
light
buggy
drove
up
to
the
curbstone
and
a
large
stout
man
within
it
squeezed
his
way
out
carefully
between
its
muddy
wheels
then
with
a
jerk
he
landed
his
in
the
roadway
clicked
the
catch
in
the
end
of
its
strap
to
the
ring
at
his
horse
bit
and
advanced
towards
the
house
it
was
bingham
so
you
have
concluded
to
give
us
a
little
attention
finally
was
jane
greeting
her
tone
was
slightly
hectoring
this
was
to
punish
him
for
having
lately
taken
more
of
her
thought
than
she
felt
him
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
fact
jane
was
uncomfortably
mindful
that
more
than
once
within
the
past
month
she
had
opened
the
morning
paper
to
building
notes
before
giving
due
heed
to
insurance
news
she
had
been
distinctly
pleased
to
read
that
the
bingham
construction
company
had
just
got
one
big
building
ready
for
tenancy
or
had
just
been
awarded
the
contract
for
another
and
once
for
a
week
she
had
followed
the
head
of
it
through
a
particularly
stubborn
bricklayers
strike
with
the
most
avid
interest
indeed
she
had
only
been
brought
back
to
herself
by
a
fire
which
had
damaged
one
of
brower
companies
to
the
extent
of
five
thousand
dollars
and
another
to
the
extent
of
ten
after
that
she
chained
her
wandering
attention
to
such
matters
as
short
rates
and
unearned
premiums
the
organization
of
new
companies
and
the
bankruptcies
of
old
ones
the
upward
climbing
of
and
assistant
managers
the
losses
suffered
by
the
companies
represented
by
the
agency
of
brower
brand
and
above
all
the
closest
scrutiny
for
the
name
of
theodore
brower
himself
nothing
pleased
her
more
than
to
read
a
paragraph
announcing
that
he
had
gone
east
to
attend
a
general
conference
except
of
course
his
return
sometimes
as
she
sat
alone
in
her
room
mending
her
stockings
or
taking
timely
stitches
in
the
fingers
of
her
gloves
she
would
further
fortify
herself
by
humming
a
scrap
from
the
refrain
of
a
song
she
had
once
heard
at
a
concert
she
would
moan
in
a
deep
contralto
voice
as
she
drew
her
needle
slowly
in
and
out
she
paused
lingeringly
on
the
second
syllable
of
and
on
the
middle
syllable
of
and
repeated
the
phrase
over
and
over
again
at
short
intervals
that
was
all
of
the
song
that
she
knew
and
after
she
had
chanted
it
a
dozen
times
or
so
her
heart
would
soften
and
her
eyes
would
overflow
and
she
would
have
to
pause
in
her
work
then
she
would
look
at
her
brimming
eyes
in
the
glass
and
wonder
how
she
could
ever
have
had
a
thought
for
any
other
man
than
theodore
while
poor
brower
would
sit
at
his
desk
and
bemoan
the
fate
that
compelled
him
to
insure
houses
instead
of
building
them
he
had
waited
until
for
his
first
affair
and
he
was
foredoomed
to
take
it
has
hard
as
a
man
may
yes
pursued
jane
you
thought
you
would
come
and
see
whether
they
were
building
us
upside
down
or
hindside
before
i
suppose
everything
looks
all
right
said
bingham
serenely
the
foreman
can
be
trusted
i
imagine
what
that
you
got
in
your
hand
jane
held
out
a
battered
horseshoe
to
which
a
few
twisted
nails
were
still
clinging
i
picked
it
up
a
minute
ago
i
was
thinking
about
laying
a
or
relaying
it
good
said
bingham
the
better
the
day
the
better
the
deed
do
you
want
to
put
that
horseshoe
under
it
um
h
replied
jane
she
walked
along
the
top
of
the
foundation
and
bingham
followed
her
jane
moved
on
until
she
found
a
practicable
stone
in
a
suitable
angle
about
here
i
think
she
said
tapping
the
stone
with
her
toe
do
you
want
me
to
pry
it
out
if
you
can
there
a
sort
of
sharp
stick
over
on
that
bingham
removed
the
stone
and
imbedded
the
horseshoe
among
the
fragments
which
had
been
worked
into
the
course
beneath
i
want
it
to
stay
too
declared
jane
as
her
eye
roamed
towards
the
just
beyond
the
foundation
trench
wait
a
second
she
skipped
across
the
small
chasm
which
intervened
between
the
and
solid
ground
she
scooped
up
some
water
from
a
hallow
puddle
with
a
battered
tin
can
and
began
the
formation
of
an
oozy
little
pocket
in
the
middle
of
the
now
if
i
only
had
a
shingle
she
said
after
she
had
reduced
the
mortar
to
the
consistency
of
slime
no
shingle
would
hold
that
said
bingham
jumping
across
after
her
here
give
me
that
can
he
poured
a
quart
or
two
of
mortar
on
top
of
the
horseshoe
and
reset
the
stone
there
said
jane
bringing
her
whole
weight
upon
it
to
this
house
and
household
said
bingham
he
raised
his
hat
she
could
not
tell
whether
he
were
in
jest
or
in
earnest
it
needs
all
the
luck
it
can
have
said
jane
it
may
be
a
nice
house
but
it
will
never
be
home
oh
yes
it
will
said
bingham
soothingly
oh
no
it
wo
returned
jane
permitting
herself
the
luxury
of
a
little
woe
even
if
we
have
wreaths
of
flowers
in
all
the
washbowls
and
transoms
that
you
can
open
and
shut
without
getting
on
to
chairs
and
a
to
regulate
the
furnace
heat
without
going
down
cellar
all
the
same
it
wo
be
our
dear
old
home
no
a
better
one
well
said
jane
resignedly
she
lifted
her
eyes
and
pointed
her
finger
aloft
i
suppose
i
shall
be
up
there
somewhere
oh
not
yet
replied
bingham
bringing
his
eyes
back
from
the
clouds
you
look
very
well
fitted
for
your
present
sphere
i
did
mean
all
the
way
up
said
jane
smilingly
dismal
i
only
meant
the
next
floor
yet
awhile
that
better
do
be
an
angel
just
yet
you
too
useful
here
if
not
ornamental
too
ornamental
too
i
never
claimed
to
be
that
observed
jane
dropping
her
eyes
do
you
think
i
improving
jane
stood
there
on
the
foundations
clad
in
the
ample
and
voluminous
fashion
of
the
day
and
topped
off
with
a
distinctly
stylish
hat
she
had
had
a
long
regimen
of
fencing
and
dumbbells
and
her
superintendence
of
the
new
house
had
led
to
many
hours
spent
in
the
open
air
her
hair
was
blowing
airily
about
her
face
and
on
her
cheek
there
was
a
slight
flush
produced
perhaps
by
her
own
question
decidedly
replied
bingham
promptly
thanks
there
always
room
for
improvement
it
the
biggest
room
in
the
world
somebody
says
she
gave
another
look
at
her
well
what
do
they
do
after
the
last
sad
rites
they
go
home
do
they
yes
let
go
home
suppose
i
drive
you
down
i
going
your
way
i
got
a
nickel
somewhere
said
jane
and
i
was
going
back
on
the
elevated
for
a
change
but
well
all
right
and
she
let
him
help
her
into
the
buggy
monstrous
big
house
is
it
she
commented
as
she
overlooked
the
foundations
from
this
loftier
point
i
do
know
how
we
are
ever
going
to
fill
it
oh
yes
you
will
said
bingham
gathering
up
the
lines
your
father
and
mother
and
your
brother
and
rosy
i
do
know
as
to
truesdale
he
such
a
you
ca
depend
very
much
on
him
and
i
do
feel
any
too
sure
about
rosy
either
she
added
inwardly
her
state
of
uncertainty
about
rosy
was
shared
in
fact
by
all
the
rest
of
the
family
it
looked
decidedly
as
if
the
youngest
daughter
were
to
leave
the
shelter
of
her
father
roof
before
the
completion
of
her
first
year
in
the
world
she
was
a
maiden
choosing
and
the
absorbing
question
was
which
on
the
side
of
william
bates
there
was
his
position
his
ability
his
certain
future
and
the
sentimental
resumption
of
old
family
relations
on
the
side
of
paston
there
was
an
entertaining
personality
and
the
paragraph
in
debrett
the
two
met
occasionally
in
the
front
parlor
and
sat
each
other
out
with
much
civility
and
pertinacity
bates
somewhat
firm
and
severe
paston
extremely
gay
and
diverting
jane
and
her
mother
lingered
in
the
and
even
ventured
a
word
now
and
then
with
the
after
she
had
left
the
boards
but
the
more
the
family
found
to
say
directly
and
indirectly
on
behalf
of
william
bates
the
more
resolutely
rosamund
turned
her
face
in
the
opposite
direction
you
ca
influence
rosy
said
jane
she
have
her
own
way
that
a
point
there
need
be
any
doubt
on
and
that
boudoir
of
hers
in
the
new
house
may
come
around
to
me
after
all
unless
i
jane
flushed
vividly
as
she
thus
cast
her
own
horoscope
bingham
at
this
moment
drew
the
buggy
up
alongside
the
curb
in
front
of
the
old
house
a
young
man
on
the
sidewalk
was
just
approaching
the
front
gate
dear
me
gasped
jane
inwardly
what
a
miserable
sinner
i
am
her
heart
sank
and
her
appetite
left
her
the
young
man
was
theodore
brower
she
had
invited
him
to
dinner
and
had
forgotten
all
about
it
xvii
well
those
are
my
views
said
belden
he
elevated
his
eyebrows
slightly
as
he
dropped
his
glance
to
a
row
of
shapely
nails
that
lay
closely
together
on
the
thick
of
his
thumb
and
an
imperceptible
smile
moved
slowly
under
the
cover
of
his
thick
mustache
to
right
completely
such
a
wrong
as
this
there
is
only
one
course
that
know
of
marshall
ceased
his
earnest
scrutiny
of
his
partner
face
to
rest
his
elbow
on
the
edge
of
his
desk
and
to
drop
his
weary
old
face
into
the
hollow
of
his
hand
there
were
more
wrinkles
on
his
cheeks
more
white
hairs
in
the
dull
dry
red
of
his
beard
more
signs
of
sleepless
hours
in
his
anxious
eyes
belden
raised
his
hand
and
swept
it
across
his
mustache
the
smile
beneath
escaped
and
spread
upward
over
his
face
his
nostrils
too
dilated
half
triumphally
it
a
most
unfortunate
affair
he
observed
further
continuing
his
series
of
careful
modulations
there
is
an
error
made
a
false
step
taken
the
family
flee
their
past
to
begin
life
anew
in
another
land
yet
at
the
very
threshold
of
their
new
life
they
meet
the
first
cause
of
all
their
misfortune
and
misery
belden
sighed
his
sigh
seemed
at
once
to
breathe
a
deep
sympathy
and
to
call
for
the
meting
out
of
justice
at
whatever
cost
to
some
one
else
as
belden
sighed
marshall
himself
almost
gave
a
groan
he
accepted
these
carefully
composed
observations
for
precisely
what
they
seemed
he
was
too
inexperienced
in
the
drama
to
detect
the
essential
insincerity
of
every
word
though
there
was
not
one
of
the
lowliest
of
his
clerks
but
had
heard
every
one
of
these
phrases
bandied
across
the
footlights
time
and
time
again
i
must
acknowledge
continued
belden
as
he
moved
towards
the
door
that
her
father
has
acted
with
a
good
deal
of
reasonableness
and
forbearance
you
can
imagine
leppin
anxiety
without
any
word
from
me
you
can
feel
how
keenly
he
looks
forward
to
having
justice
done
to
having
complete
reparation
made
you
know
what
that
means
as
well
as
i
do
and
he
passed
out
leaving
his
senior
to
ponder
the
matter
alone
belden
was
the
first
person
with
whom
marshall
had
permitted
himself
a
full
canvass
of
the
situation
the
sole
husbandman
towards
whom
he
had
turned
for
assistance
in
garnering
the
of
truesdale
career
abroad
never
before
had
evil
grazed
against
him
and
his
he
had
regarded
it
in
fact
as
something
appertaining
principally
to
persons
in
a
lower
walk
of
life
he
had
heard
of
such
subjects
as
being
handled
in
fiction
and
he
had
noticed
them
touched
upon
in
the
theatrical
reviews
of
the
newspapers
but
nothing
of
the
sinful
the
vicious
the
malodorous
had
ever
within
his
recollection
come
to
his
family
to
his
friends
or
even
to
any
of
his
business
associates
yet
here
it
had
come
at
last
and
it
must
be
confronted
he
had
quite
shrank
from
the
ordeal
of
considering
the
matter
with
so
nimble
and
experienced
a
person
as
truesdale
himself
and
he
was
almost
too
in
his
to
attempt
an
discussion
of
it
with
his
own
wife
it
took
a
large
share
of
his
fortitude
to
broach
the
matter
even
to
his
elder
son
i
ca
talk
to
truesdale
about
it
said
this
virginal
old
man
as
he
sat
in
roger
office
you
got
to
do
it
i
ca
well
really
father
began
roger
he
had
almost
the
air
of
resenting
an
imputation
i
do
mean
that
roger
said
his
father
in
some
distress
i
have
every
confidence
in
you
i
believe
you
all
right
but
has
anybody
seen
the
girl
your
mother
says
that
well
she
says
that
jane
has
seen
her
he
brought
in
his
daughter
name
with
a
great
distress
and
your
aunt
lydia
she
told
your
mother
she
was
sure
this
girl
was
one
to
lend
herself
to
to
h
said
roger
in
a
way
he
always
subjected
his
aunt
lydia
opinions
and
impressions
to
a
double
discount
meanwhile
the
odor
of
truesdale
offence
permeated
the
house
as
completely
as
the
office
rosy
wondered
what
could
be
under
way
as
she
saw
her
mother
and
jane
seated
on
unaccustomed
chairs
in
unaccustomed
attitudes
at
unaccustomed
times
in
unaccustomed
rooms
while
they
engaged
in
brief
and
infrequent
interchanges
of
words
or
for
the
production
of
long
and
eloquent
silences
jane
in
fact
took
the
matter
with
the
rigorous
thoroughness
of
the
complete
theorist
she
knew
what
it
was
to
thread
the
mazes
of
a
guilty
conscience
through
half
a
dozen
consecutive
chapters
she
knew
how
it
felt
to
see
the
agonies
of
acknowledged
sin
transferred
from
chair
to
sofa
and
sofa
to
chair
over
the
full
extent
of
a
large
and
stage
how
the
leaves
had
fluttered
how
the
footlights
had
palpitated
how
those
people
had
suffered
and
how
she
had
suffered
with
them
how
she
was
suffering
now
and
how
much
greater
still
must
be
the
suffering
of
her
erring
and
idolized
brother
if
he
had
only
been
born
with
eyes
like
other
people
she
would
moan
the
actual
mental
state
of
truesdale
was
however
with
jane
and
with
everybody
else
a
matter
of
pure
conjecture
very
little
in
fact
was
seen
of
him
he
breakfasted
in
his
own
room
as
he
had
done
ever
since
his
return
home
when
the
waitress
had
declined
to
enter
the
chamber
with
his
coffee
and
rolls
he
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
had
directed
to
have
them
set
on
the
floor
outside
pudeur
he
more
than
once
observed
as
her
knock
drew
him
towards
the
door
his
lunch
he
took
wherever
he
happened
to
be
and
he
dined
at
his
french
restaurant
or
at
a
new
italian
one
where
the
was
unapproachable
and
where
everything
was
cheap
plentiful
and
informal
he
returned
home
at
his
own
discretion
and
sometimes
was
heard
working
upon
the
obdurate
old
at
midnight
or
later
among
the
first
of
the
family
to
have
extended
speech
with
him
after
the
was
his
aunt
lydia
he
had
gone
to
her
house
to
put
the
last
few
finishing
touches
to
bertie
patterson
portrait
to
his
aunt
and
to
bertie
herself
the
portrait
seemed
already
finished
but
it
is
only
the
artist
who
knows
when
the
end
has
really
been
reached
he
asked
his
aunt
for
bertie
well
she
hesitated
as
she
looked
at
him
with
a
kind
of
furtive
and
wondering
interest
bertie
is
very
busy
this
afternoon
if
there
is
anything
more
to
be
done
and
i
do
exactly
see
that
there
is
it
must
be
done
without
her
i
afraid
ca
i
see
her
he
asked
brusquely
this
is
the
very
time
i
need
her
what
is
she
so
busy
about
she
is
packing
you
know
i
kept
her
a
good
deal
longer
already
than
i
expected
to
she
ca
stay
into
summer
her
mother
has
written
several
times
asking
for
her
and
now
finally
she
really
got
to
go
there
was
a
grieving
disappointment
in
rhodes
voice
and
a
cast
of
keen
but
discreet
curiosity
in
her
eye
when
is
she
going
in
the
morning
then
her
own
people
will
get
her
well
before
dark
i
not
to
see
her
to
say
my
own
cousin
almost
nonsense
not
at
all
i
tell
her
for
you
and
the
picture
well
we
may
consider
finished
i
think
her
eyes
were
resting
on
the
wall
behind
him
he
turned
and
saw
the
portrait
fastened
upon
it
so
she
is
not
even
to
have
he
began
now
truesdale
interrupted
his
aunt
the
picture
is
not
bertie
but
mine
i
thought
you
understood
that
she
followed
him
to
the
door
you
wo
stay
a
few
minutes
longer
she
inquired
with
an
emollient
intention
he
shook
his
head
i
wo
say
truesdale
she
proceeded
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
how
disappointed
i
am
everything
of
course
is
at
a
now
whether
things
ever
go
on
again
will
depend
upon
you
yourself
i
am
sure
that
any
any
expression
of
regret
any
promise
of
of
ouf
said
truesdale
as
he
descended
the
steps
undecided
whether
to
laugh
or
to
curse
i
was
a
student
at
cadiz
he
found
himself
humming
h
one
thing
learned
in
the
study
of
this
peculiar
civilization
general
badness
jollied
up
specific
badness
frowned
down
what
other
discoveries
await
me
i
wonder
before
he
had
taken
a
dozen
steps
a
brougham
drawn
by
a
pair
of
blacks
in
glittering
harness
drew
up
suddenly
at
the
curbstone
in
obedience
to
directions
given
through
the
door
in
a
second
the
door
opened
wide
and
gladys
mckenna
beckoned
to
him
get
in
she
uttered
in
a
cry
she
had
divined
the
situation
in
two
swift
glances
she
had
witnessed
the
moody
exit
of
truesdale
and
she
had
had
a
glimpse
of
the
anxious
little
face
of
bertie
patterson
in
the
above
her
desire
to
live
life
to
dramatize
it
as
promptly
and
effectively
as
possible
had
led
her
to
the
instant
appropriation
of
the
banned
and
rejected
truesdale
thus
it
was
that
she
figured
him
get
in
she
repeated
i
can
take
you
along
six
or
eight
blocks
the
coachman
knows
you
by
sight
i
sure
but
never
mind
nothing
matters
now
my
letter
did
you
get
it
another
thought
truesdale
he
made
the
door
fast
no
i
felt
sure
you
would
she
panted
excitedly
i
gave
it
to
that
man
to
mail
she
pointed
towards
the
occupant
of
the
he
has
played
me
false
truesdale
smiled
at
her
phrase
well
never
mind
you
can
tell
me
what
there
was
in
it
he
stretched
out
his
long
legs
negligently
under
the
opposite
seat
determined
to
take
this
new
ordeal
as
lightly
as
possible
from
his
point
of
view
the
girl
was
doing
nothing
towards
gaining
a
greater
measure
of
approval
she
never
had
any
consideration
for
me
he
was
thinking
until
she
saw
that
i
cared
for
the
town
as
little
as
she
did
and
she
has
waited
to
fling
herself
at
me
unreservedly
until
i
have
shown
myself
too
awful
for
anybody
else
why
did
i
let
her
pick
me
up
and
how
soon
can
i
have
her
set
me
down
you
will
learn
now
who
your
real
friends
are
she
declared
casting
herself
energetically
into
a
leading
not
friends
but
friends
through
thick
and
thin
let
me
tell
you
there
is
a
conspiracy
against
you
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
looked
at
him
with
a
wide
stare
she
seemed
to
thrill
with
the
consciousness
of
an
important
participation
in
a
succession
of
stirring
actualities
is
there
indeed
whatever
one
plight
there
is
little
consolation
in
the
ministrations
of
an
unwelcome
hand
considering
this
that
and
the
other
he
was
now
as
at
his
aunt
door
again
midway
between
a
laugh
and
a
curse
yes
that
man
that
german
or
whatever
was
at
the
house
last
evening
and
oh
why
will
albert
drive
so
fast
she
complained
as
she
made
a
seeming
calculation
of
the
many
things
she
had
to
say
and
the
little
time
she
had
to
say
them
in
ca
something
be
done
to
make
him
go
a
little
slower
the
horses
feel
lively
answered
truesdale
to
whom
the
present
rapid
course
was
perfectly
agreeable
i
expect
he
have
to
let
them
go
their
own
gait
he
glanced
out
at
a
passing
church
or
two
and
frowned
slightly
why
did
this
girl
insist
upon
doing
his
mathematical
problems
for
him
had
not
he
himself
already
put
his
two
and
two
together
and
made
them
four
gladys
went
on
telling
him
what
she
knew
guessed
surmised
suspected
and
they
they
suspect
she
continued
in
a
mounting
tone
of
tragedy
and
i
i
going
home
in
a
few
days
there
were
tears
on
the
dark
fringes
of
her
eyes
he
thought
of
a
wax
image
exposed
overnight
to
a
heavy
dew
and
all
for
your
sake
the
moisture
seemed
to
say
truesdale
began
to
feel
uncomfortable
and
a
shade
ungrateful
i
dare
say
she
means
well
he
thought
but
i
i
wish
she
would
the
carriage
was
passing
between
two
other
churches
he
saw
that
he
might
alight
after
another
square
of
it
one
more
will
be
plenty
he
muttered
and
already
his
hand
stole
towards
the
handle
of
the
door
you
ca
think
how
they
both
hate
you
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
me
too
i
afraid
they
really
driving
me
out
of
the
house
but
never
mind
i
can
endure
even
more
than
that
for
one
that
for
the
right
when
did
you
say
you
were
going
inquired
truesdale
it
was
only
by
asking
plain
questions
that
he
could
oppose
this
robust
romanticism
day
after
or
the
next
well
said
truesdale
quietly
i
should
think
you
would
do
very
well
at
home
much
better
than
here
but
where
am
i
to
see
you
before
i
go
where
are
we
to
say
a
clanged
along
the
immediately
ahead
of
them
and
the
ten
yellow
stories
of
a
vast
hotel
loomed
up
just
beyond
right
on
this
corner
replied
truesdale
as
the
carriage
bumped
across
the
tracks
the
interval
is
short
as
you
suggest
and
there
is
no
time
like
the
present
he
put
his
hand
on
the
door
and
fixed
his
eye
upon
the
corner
shop
he
often
bought
a
cigar
there
and
meant
to
buy
one
now
he
also
meant
this
as
literally
final
you
want
me
to
let
you
out
here
stop
albert
well
she
said
smilingly
waiving
the
idea
of
finality
you
shall
know
where
you
can
meet
me
you
are
not
deserted
by
everybody
after
all
you
see
she
gave
him
her
hand
or
rather
laid
hold
of
his
but
take
good
care
of
yourself
all
the
same
truesdale
stepped
out
i
try
to
he
said
mumblingly
i
always
have
being
thus
minded
truesdale
received
but
grudgingly
the
tenders
of
his
brother
roger
to
assist
in
the
caretaking
he
admitted
however
that
it
would
be
less
embarrassing
to
confer
with
one
person
than
a
dozen
and
that
if
the
whole
connection
were
to
be
represented
by
a
single
spokesman
then
roger
was
the
one
that
he
preferred
roger
was
held
by
his
family
to
be
above
all
foibles
and
frailties
his
aunt
lydia
had
once
told
him
on
the
day
of
a
niece
hopeless
return
to
the
east
that
he
had
too
much
head
and
not
enough
heart
it
is
certain
that
he
had
marked
out
a
definite
course
for
himself
and
that
nothing
so
far
had
had
the
power
to
divert
him
materially
from
it
and
he
had
a
contempt
for
the
man
who
permitted
the
gray
matter
of
his
brain
to
be
demoralized
by
the
red
matter
in
his
veins
he
kept
a
firm
hand
on
his
own
affairs
and
on
those
of
his
father
that
were
not
immediately
connected
with
the
business
of
his
father
firm
his
severe
face
was
as
he
thought
the
face
of
a
lawyer
ought
to
be
and
he
could
address
the
higher
courts
with
such
a
loud
and
brazen
utterance
as
to
cause
the
almost
to
feel
the
judges
shrinking
and
shrivelling
under
their
robes
his
was
a
hot
and
vehement
nature
but
it
burned
with
a
flame
blue
rather
than
red
well
he
said
with
a
look
of
extreme
distaste
fixed
half
on
his
brother
and
half
on
his
we
can
accept
her
and
make
the
best
of
her
i
have
seen
her
and
her
father
while
i
ca
say
i
admire
the
personal
character
of
either
i
am
not
prejudiced
by
the
fact
that
he
is
only
a
clerk
and
she
only
a
they
are
beginners
here
i
am
willing
to
believe
that
they
were
something
better
at
home
we
can
accept
her
we
shall
have
to
i
suppose
truesdale
reared
his
beautiful
brazen
front
and
flashed
on
his
brother
a
haughty
and
disdainful
smile
you
can
accept
her
will
you
please
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
that
and
at
home
he
burst
into
open
and
derisive
laughter
what
new
arcadia
is
this
where
even
the
lawyers
walk
about
with
their
beribboned
crooks
and
the
little
following
behind
them
we
have
been
sitting
in
conclave
have
we
on
a
mossy
bank
in
some
sylvan
shade
with
chaplets
on
our
brows
and
we
have
piped
and
twittered
over
the
matter
and
have
decided
that
we
can
her
well
you
can
do
more
than
i
can
he
added
abruptly
his
foot
slipped
from
the
rung
of
the
opposite
chair
and
fell
to
the
bare
floor
with
a
contemptuous
clump
you
got
your
own
character
to
clear
have
you
asked
roger
with
a
severe
brevity
truesdale
replaced
his
foot
on
the
rung
of
the
other
chair
and
slid
down
into
his
own
as
he
thrust
his
hands
deeper
into
his
pockets
dear
me
he
said
in
affected
apprehension
am
i
in
any
danger
well
well
if
such
a
thing
can
hurt
a
young
man
i
shall
be
glad
to
know
it
i
never
knew
it
before
now
for
example
he
drew
out
one
of
his
hands
and
waved
it
vaguely
he
seemed
to
be
conjuring
up
a
wider
and
more
liberal
world
the
only
one
he
had
learned
it
can
insisted
his
brother
it
will
both
you
and
your
family
truesdale
thought
flashed
back
to
bertie
patterson
and
the
unfinished
picture
it
came
to
him
all
at
once
that
his
brother
might
be
better
worth
listening
to
than
he
had
been
disposed
to
concede
and
your
family
roger
repeated
but
truesdale
thought
lingering
over
the
picture
made
little
of
this
second
point
he
did
scant
justice
to
the
mortification
of
his
mother
before
her
and
her
few
remaining
neighbors
or
that
of
his
sisters
within
the
circle
which
they
had
lately
constructed
for
themselves
nor
did
he
yet
realize
even
with
bertie
picture
in
mind
the
hundred
checks
and
bars
that
awaited
him
in
a
society
of
whose
primitive
purity
he
had
made
a
jest
whenever
occasion
came
dear
roger
he
presently
rejoined
in
his
most
genial
and
winning
voice
you
mean
well
i
am
sure
well
by
me
and
by
the
family
and
by
everybody
and
i
dare
say
you
do
very
nicely
in
your
own
narrow
field
but
as
for
knowing
life
well
really
now
do
you
think
you
understand
what
it
is
to
live
live
cried
roger
with
a
sonorous
contempt
who
understand
what
it
is
to
live
then
the
man
who
has
all
his
work
and
worry
done
for
him
by
some
one
else
truesdale
smiled
serene
and
unabashed
the
world
is
wide
he
said
with
an
exquisite
tolerance
it
is
a
very
comprehensive
subject
you
must
take
it
up
one
of
these
days
you
hardly
made
a
beginning
on
it
yet
the
world
cried
roger
again
with
a
vibrant
indignation
at
this
impertinence
who
the
world
if
not
my
father
and
i
and
all
the
other
earnest
men
who
work
to
make
the
frame
of
things
and
to
hold
it
together
are
the
world
and
you
you
are
only
the
rubbish
strewn
over
the
top
of
it
he
collected
this
rubbish
and
constructed
from
it
a
frankenstein
monster
with
a
heart
of
cork
a
brow
of
brass
and
a
of
then
with
a
harsh
laugh
and
a
arm
he
scattered
it
apart
again
perhaps
truesdale
took
these
words
and
gestures
merely
as
an
example
of
roger
forensic
eloquence
for
my
dear
brother
he
began
quietly
while
roger
beat
his
foot
upon
the
floor
stung
to
increased
indignation
by
the
conscious
artificiality
of
such
an
address
my
dear
brother
said
truesdale
you
do
quite
get
my
position
in
this
trifling
episode
every
little
has
its
monsieur
x
of
course
myself
in
this
instance
and
rightfully
enough
but
is
monsieur
x
the
only
gentleman
involved
let
us
see
who
comes
before
monsieur
x
why
monsieur
w
to
be
sure
and
who
before
monsieur
w
monsieur
v
pas
and
there
is
somebody
still
in
front
of
monsieur
and
if
we
go
far
enough
back
we
may
come
at
last
even
to
monsieur
a
now
why
are
all
these
worthy
gentlemen
passed
over
in
favor
of
monsieur
x
well
perhaps
monsieur
w
for
example
is
a
captain
of
dragoons
and
already
mated
and
maybe
monsieur
v
is
a
young
baron
whose
family
wo
stand
any
nonsense
about
him
families
are
different
and
as
for
monsieur
a
well
let
us
put
him
down
for
a
poor
devil
of
a
student
who
cuts
no
figure
at
all
but
monsieur
x
ah
that
is
different
he
is
pounced
upon
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
it
is
monsieur
x
who
has
the
scrupulous
and
mother
truesdale
and
the
little
coterie
of
who
never
truesdale
for
shame
and
the
and
supersensitive
father
with
millions
and
millions
stored
away
in
bursting
somewhere
or
other
oh
those
those
those
truesdale
what
do
you
mean
are
they
adventurers
are
they
after
truesdale
threw
back
his
head
closing
his
eyes
and
twirling
his
thumbs
i
knew
them
there
i
know
them
here
then
he
opened
his
eyes
and
gave
his
brother
a
glance
of
satirical
approval
roger
you
are
ending
where
i
should
have
expected
you
to
begin
it
is
not
the
end
cried
roger
savagely
he
saw
that
he
had
allowed
his
view
of
the
matter
to
be
wrongly
colored
by
the
impressions
of
his
father
and
the
representations
of
belden
and
truesdale
comments
lacerated
his
as
with
griffins
claws
have
i
told
you
that
they
have
taken
legal
advice
and
that
and
that
the
whole
grovelling
tribe
of
leppins
outnumbering
the
van
horns
possibly
are
ready
with
oral
testimony
and
a
shower
of
depositions
and
what
all
besides
ouf
not
an
inch
do
i
yield
suis
not
an
inch
should
anybody
else
yield
well
thank
me
roger
for
having
given
you
this
little
glimpse
into
the
great
big
world
it
full
of
interest
he
rose
suddenly
stiff
and
straight
and
slender
as
some
young
come
roger
put
on
your
hat
and
go
with
me
to
japan
he
looked
over
into
the
drawer
of
his
brother
desk
more
of
those
maps
i
see
other
maps
another
subdivision
i
can
do
my
work
without
trotting
over
the
whole
globe
cook
county
is
big
enough
for
me
h
you
seem
to
be
branching
out
quite
extensively
only
do
get
in
too
deep
truesdale
gave
this
valuable
advice
in
a
patronizing
tone
of
which
he
alone
was
master
yes
i
should
think
cook
county
would
do
very
well
for
you
until
you
have
learned
to
spik
something
besides
ze
engleesh
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
moved
towards
the
door
english
will
do
for
retorted
roger
savagely
well
turn
the
thing
over
in
this
new
light
continued
his
brother
pleasantly
and
one
thing
more
a
little
suggestion
you
have
some
notion
of
the
man
who
comes
before
monsieur
x
give
a
bit
of
attention
now
to
the
man
who
comes
after
he
could
be
of
the
greatest
service
to
us
permanent
service
find
him
find
monsieur
y
and
arrange
it
that
he
shall
be
the
last
and
truesdale
sauntered
airily
out
of
the
room
xviii
you
might
have
thought
it
no
great
concern
of
his
you
might
have
imagined
all
our
efforts
as
only
a
part
of
a
play
and
his
interest
merely
the
interest
of
a
there
was
an
indignant
rasp
in
roger
voice
and
he
looked
across
to
his
father
with
a
protesting
scowl
he
almost
made
me
feel
as
if
i
had
never
learned
the
alphabet
david
marshall
fixed
an
intent
and
anxious
gaze
on
his
son
face
and
ran
his
hand
tremulously
along
the
arm
of
his
chair
he
knew
about
how
roger
felt
truesdale
had
more
than
once
made
him
feel
the
same
way
himself
the
old
man
had
remained
at
home
throughout
the
day
too
ill
and
nervous
for
the
store
and
too
resourceless
for
the
house
he
had
worried
through
twelve
hours
as
wearing
as
any
he
could
recollect
he
had
never
been
more
unfitted
for
business
yet
never
as
he
made
it
seem
more
demanded
by
it
he
imagined
himself
as
still
the
of
the
marshall
belden
company
indeed
he
found
in
that
belief
some
consolation
for
his
difficulty
in
reconciling
himself
to
the
style
and
title
that
the
course
of
the
business
had
finally
evolved
he
tormented
himself
with
thoughts
of
odds
and
ends
of
work
left
over
from
yesterday
or
from
last
week
or
with
the
apprehension
of
some
fresh
step
taken
some
new
course
entered
upon
by
the
younger
and
more
ardent
men
of
whom
the
company
was
largely
composed
he
had
laughed
more
than
once
over
the
joke
of
business
acquaintances
who
told
him
they
had
had
to
take
young
men
into
partnership
because
it
was
impossible
to
pay
the
salaries
they
demanded
yet
something
more
radical
had
happened
to
himself
the
young
men
had
not
only
come
in
but
they
were
showing
a
disposition
to
get
things
into
their
own
hands
their
former
manager
their
credit
man
several
heads
of
departments
all
these
had
rallied
under
belden
and
together
seemed
to
be
trimming
the
sails
to
as
speculative
a
course
as
a
craft
essentially
conservative
in
its
nature
could
well
be
made
to
take
marshall
had
not
formulated
so
clearly
as
this
the
practical
primacy
of
belden
but
he
felt
the
necessity
of
his
own
presence
and
chafed
under
the
temporary
withdrawal
of
his
own
guiding
hand
but
more
than
the
course
of
affairs
at
the
store
more
than
the
avalanche
of
complicated
minutiae
involved
in
the
progress
of
the
new
house
more
than
the
dawning
risks
attendant
upon
roger
widening
operations
in
land
more
than
the
amiable
persecutions
of
friends
whose
ambitions
for
him
were
greater
than
his
own
did
the
courses
of
his
younger
son
and
all
their
threatening
consequences
disturb
his
days
and
harass
his
nights
haunting
alike
the
hours
set
apart
for
work
and
for
sleep
and
even
the
few
brief
intervals
between
he
would
rise
in
the
morning
haggard
and
after
a
sleepless
night
he
would
toil
through
the
weary
and
perplexing
hours
of
a
dragging
day
and
he
would
spend
his
evenings
usually
in
a
miserable
and
solitary
contemplation
of
all
his
thickening
annoyances
and
ills
poor
pa
jane
would
say
to
her
mother
as
she
watched
his
bent
and
lagging
steps
moving
towards
the
recess
of
the
there
he
goes
worrying
all
off
by
himself
again
her
mother
over
her
sewing
or
the
evening
paper
perhaps
would
check
the
girl
impulse
to
follow
do
chase
after
your
father
jane
got
enough
things
to
bother
him
already
so
that
except
for
the
occasional
charitable
moment
when
jane
unimpeded
perched
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
attempted
to
divert
his
wearing
thoughts
from
their
channel
the
old
man
spent
his
evenings
largely
too
largely
alone
the
rare
visits
of
roger
never
highly
ameliorative
were
none
the
more
so
now
the
grisly
wrestling
with
realities
does
little
to
promote
the
exudation
of
balm
roger
was
tough
and
technical
and
litigious
his
was
the
hand
to
seize
not
to
soothe
roger
had
had
a
second
and
more
explicit
interview
with
truesdale
before
truesdale
had
taken
an
airy
and
irresponsible
flitting
from
town
he
had
also
prosecuted
various
inquiries
of
his
own
in
various
directions
and
these
inquiries
had
resulted
in
his
coming
to
look
up
truesdale
frothy
suggestion
with
more
seriousness
and
upon
truesdale
himself
with
more
consideration
if
not
with
more
respect
he
still
withheld
he
is
a
complete
fool
after
all
admitted
roger
i
never
thought
he
was
responded
his
father
dully
he
has
some
little
sense
i
acknowledge
if
it
were
only
said
the
old
man
with
a
mournful
smile
roger
looked
forth
streetward
pondering
a
long
shifted
its
line
of
glimmering
squares
rapidly
southward
two
or
three
couples
passed
by
on
the
pavement
respiring
the
suave
air
of
an
early
june
evening
it
means
money
said
roger
presently
as
much
as
is
necessary
replied
his
father
tremulously
though
i
never
could
spare
it
worse
than
now
and
more
well
more
dirty
work
for
me
he
thought
of
the
van
horn
matter
now
as
good
as
abandoned
never
mind
though
i
getting
used
to
it
you
are
the
only
help
i
have
roger
the
only
one
to
save
us
from
this
disgrace
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
and
a
feeble
tremor
ran
through
the
and
fingers
that
he
advanced
towards
roger
shoulder
father
is
not
the
man
he
used
to
be
thought
roger
he
felt
that
his
sympathy
was
largely
qualified
by
the
impatience
and
aversion
which
must
always
move
a
young
man
when
he
observes
the
first
signs
of
physical
and
mental
impairment
in
an
older
one
and
he
regretted
that
it
was
so
and
he
was
almost
ashamed
to
feel
relieved
when
his
father
withdrew
his
hand
besides
roger
and
his
father
only
marshall
and
jane
were
at
home
rosamund
was
in
wisconsin
and
no
one
was
sorry
to
have
her
away
she
was
a
guest
of
bates
at
lake
geneva
the
central
figure
of
a
in
fact
bates
fondness
for
nature
did
not
stop
with
flowers
it
led
her
to
the
fields
and
woods
where
they
grew
no
sooner
was
the
back
of
the
winter
fairly
broken
than
she
began
to
preach
the
gospel
of
country
life
she
took
the
cream
of
june
and
left
to
later
comers
the
skimmed
milk
of
july
and
august
she
always
saw
that
her
wisconsin
place
was
ready
for
her
by
the
middle
of
may
then
for
the
next
five
months
she
passed
back
and
forth
between
town
and
country
according
to
the
nature
of
her
engagements
and
the
character
of
the
weather
truesdale
was
in
wisconsin
too
but
not
of
the
you
know
my
dear
bates
said
to
jane
i
had
meant
to
have
your
brother
but
jane
bowed
her
head
and
never
thought
of
venturing
to
ask
her
how
she
that
same
night
jane
slowly
tore
her
plans
for
the
home
into
long
strips
and
burned
them
in
the
gas
one
at
a
time
never
listen
to
a
word
about
anything
like
this
now
truesdale
left
behind
no
precise
indications
of
his
movements
the
only
person
to
whom
he
announced
anything
like
a
programme
was
arthur
fasten
who
met
him
on
the
way
to
the
station
with
his
bag
in
one
hand
and
his
kit
in
the
other
off
are
you
called
paston
do
you
begin
the
season
rather
early
just
for
a
few
days
replied
truesdale
a
little
sketching
tour
up
north
change
of
scene
and
air
you
know
where
are
you
going
oh
anywhere
i
shall
be
at
bellagio
and
at
pontresina
the
day
after
then
i
shall
dip
down
towards
scheveningen
and
zante
if
possible
i
have
always
wanted
to
try
zante
he
smiled
jovially
i
hear
there
a
lovely
ruined
abbey
at
fort
atkinson
everybody
does
it
and
they
say
too
that
the
capital
at
madison
is
a
grand
old
structure
he
gave
a
hitch
to
his
light
valise
and
moved
on
with
a
diminished
smile
of
course
you
got
your
cook
ticket
and
your
meal
coupons
called
paston
grinning
broadly
do
protested
truesdale
turning
back
you
never
looked
less
like
a
gentleman
i
hope
your
ticket
takes
in
geneva
said
paston
in
no
degree
offended
if
it
does
i
may
meet
you
there
i
going
up
to
stay
over
sunday
i
ca
tell
without
looking
replied
truesdale
it
away
at
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
and
he
moved
on
rosy
there
though
he
called
back
he
did
this
largely
under
the
promptings
of
a
sense
of
justice
paston
was
as
much
entitled
to
push
one
project
as
he
himself
was
to
push
another
yes
i
know
said
paston
this
ubiquitous
and
person
made
his
presence
known
throughout
geneva
with
no
loss
of
time
he
caused
himself
to
be
remembered
by
bates
for
a
small
dance
on
saturday
night
and
also
secured
himself
from
forgetfulness
in
connection
with
her
excursion
for
sunday
morning
this
active
and
woman
was
the
prime
mover
in
a
poor
children
camp
which
was
in
process
of
construction
near
the
far
end
of
the
lake
she
could
not
expect
her
dozen
young
people
to
take
an
absorbing
interest
in
her
philanthropies
but
she
knew
that
an
excursion
was
none
the
worse
for
having
an
objective
point
and
she
did
not
feel
that
she
was
likely
to
please
her
guests
the
less
by
giving
a
little
incidental
pleasure
to
herself
i
got
to
have
something
to
she
explained
to
paston
i
could
be
content
to
come
up
here
and
pass
the
summer
in
mere
idleness
they
were
sitting
on
a
pair
of
up
near
the
bow
paston
looking
backward
saw
rosamund
and
william
bates
together
near
the
stern
it
must
be
a
terrible
thing
to
be
cursed
with
ambition
and
executive
ability
observed
paston
i
awfully
glad
have
got
any
well
there
it
is
she
responded
i
got
to
have
something
on
hand
i
got
to
engineer
i
got
to
manage
paston
brought
back
his
eyes
from
william
bates
and
rosamund
everybody
knows
what
a
capable
manager
you
are
he
said
this
as
he
said
so
many
other
things
with
a
frank
and
bold
directness
that
made
any
suspicion
of
an
almost
an
impossibility
well
do
commit
yourself
until
you
get
there
then
you
can
make
your
own
observations
she
took
his
remark
as
almost
anybody
else
would
have
felt
obliged
to
take
it
just
for
what
it
sounded
nobody
understood
better
than
paston
the
deceptive
quality
resident
in
a
truth
plumply
told
shall
i
see
cecilia
ingles
there
paston
was
stopping
with
the
ingleses
and
had
rowed
across
immediately
after
breakfast
i
think
i
heard
them
speak
about
driving
down
i
say
he
added
it
a
rum
go
for
her
i
do
see
why
rejoined
susan
bates
disputatiously
she
is
old
enough
to
take
things
seriously
she
has
got
far
enough
along
to
begin
to
be
in
earnest
the
first
thing
she
asked
me
was
how
much
money
i
wanted
do
want
any
of
your
money
at
all
i
told
her
such
a
cause
as
this
i
can
scoop
up
all
the
money
i
want
by
the
shovelful
no
what
i
want
is
your
personal
interest
that
about
the
hardest
thing
get
in
cases
like
this
well
i
believe
you
got
it
declared
paston
hitching
about
on
his
seat
she
has
given
up
all
hope
of
escaping
from
you
you
a
tyrant
an
inexorable
tyrant
she
says
she
going
to
do
as
you
direct
all
right
returned
susan
bates
only
do
be
so
sticky
about
it
she
pronounced
this
epithet
very
distinctly
and
deliberately
she
had
long
meant
to
use
it
with
paston
some
time
or
other
ever
since
jane
had
imparted
it
to
her
in
fact
sticky
cried
the
young
man
me
sticky
yes
fussy
critical
disagreeable
censorious
she
moved
her
fingers
as
if
disentangling
them
from
a
sheet
of
it
one
of
your
own
words
is
it
yes
but
what
it
means
is
stiff
poky
awkward
and
nobody
else
has
ever
called
me
that
susan
bates
with
a
slight
touch
of
mortification
at
once
set
the
whole
matter
aside
cecilia
is
good
enough
at
heart
she
went
on
instantly
no
i
do
want
her
money
she
ploughed
rapidly
ahead
except
as
a
visitor
every
visitor
must
give
something
and
the
first
must
give
the
most
you
are
the
first
i
stammered
paston
with
an
uneasy
laugh
all
of
you
i
mean
she
waved
her
hand
over
the
whole
yacht
feel
for
your
dollars
you
will
find
a
fastened
to
the
first
tree
at
the
landing
really
said
paston
vastly
ill
at
ease
susan
bates
merely
laughed
feeling
that
she
had
regained
the
upperhand
she
had
not
been
so
tickled
since
the
day
when
minnie
peters
had
put
into
her
hands
the
official
notification
that
she
was
at
length
a
member
of
that
obdurate
and
exacting
musical
society
but
poor
fellow
she
said
to
herself
i
must
tease
him
she
looked
back
the
length
of
the
boat
towards
rosy
rosy
at
the
same
moment
was
looking
forward
the
length
of
the
boat
towards
her
a
pause
had
apparently
come
in
william
careful
enumeration
of
the
which
covered
the
wooded
slopes
of
either
shore
many
of
them
were
the
residences
of
people
whom
rosy
had
met
for
the
first
time
during
the
past
winter
and
their
interest
was
therefore
biographical
as
well
as
topographical
but
now
the
interest
of
whatever
kind
was
running
a
bit
thinly
rosy
gave
a
careless
word
now
and
then
to
another
young
girl
beside
her
or
to
a
new
young
man
sprawling
at
her
feet
but
her
eyes
turned
every
few
minutes
towards
the
bow
you
catch
the
idea
bates
was
saying
we
bring
them
out
on
the
train
in
two
hours
and
give
them
a
ride
on
the
public
steamer
to
the
camp
we
keep
them
a
week
we
start
in
with
a
fresh
lot
every
monday
morning
right
through
the
summer
where
do
you
get
them
asked
pasten
making
talk
industriously
do
you
set
traps
for
them
or
perhaps
you
go
to
the
bureau
of
child
labor
and
say
so
many
tons
of
orphans
to
be
delivered
on
the
fifth
instant
at
sharp
eh
he
had
quite
recovered
his
spirits
get
them
dear
me
there
are
plenty
to
be
got
i
expect
we
shall
have
to
enlarge
the
dormitories
before
the
summer
is
half
over
and
what
is
ingles
to
do
with
them
after
they
got
he
asked
with
his
eye
on
the
foam
and
bubbles
of
the
wake
is
she
to
take
the
kinks
out
of
their
hair
every
morning
by
early
is
she
to
wash
all
their
little
porringers
and
hang
them
up
in
rows
on
their
little
hooks
is
she
to
keep
tab
when
they
go
in
paddling
and
check
them
off
as
they
come
out
to
see
how
many
have
been
carried
away
by
the
undertow
bates
declined
to
consider
the
undertow
see
there
it
is
the
yacht
had
rounded
a
small
wooded
promontory
and
now
approached
a
shallow
shore
where
a
gingerly
landing
was
to
be
effected
at
a
rude
and
rickety
little
pier
a
grove
of
oak
and
maple
came
almost
to
the
water
edge
and
within
it
a
number
of
structures
of
clean
yellow
pine
were
taking
shape
and
substance
the
odor
of
the
pine
mingled
with
the
earthy
smells
of
the
grove
now
and
then
a
little
pile
of
sawdust
was
taken
swirlingly
by
the
breeze
and
here
and
there
a
long
fresh
shaving
was
seen
caught
upon
the
prickly
branches
of
some
june
rose
paston
helped
bates
out
on
to
the
pier
with
a
cautious
gallantry
and
immediately
betook
himself
to
the
younger
members
of
the
party
he
considered
the
courtesies
due
from
a
guest
as
now
amply
accomplished
he
attached
himself
at
once
to
rosamund
he
helped
her
over
the
loose
litter
of
lumber
he
steadied
ladders
for
her
at
every
fresh
feint
of
mounting
he
bestirred
himself
to
a
rapacious
culling
of
for
the
mere
opportunity
of
tying
them
together
with
a
shaving
once
he
sprinkled
them
over
with
a
handful
of
sawdust
after
the
manner
of
a
florist
extemporizing
a
heavy
dew
rosy
laughed
and
nodded
and
thrust
the
flowers
into
her
belt
you
will
never
be
serious
she
protested
oh
yes
i
shall
i
am
always
a
good
deal
more
serious
than
people
suppose
he
bestowed
upon
her
a
look
serious
enough
to
match
his
words
it
was
as
serious
as
any
one
could
have
wished
and
rosy
dropped
her
eyes
and
was
distinctly
pensive
for
a
minute
or
two
presently
the
ingleses
came
picking
their
way
through
the
grove
in
a
surrey
cecilia
ingles
alighted
with
the
air
of
one
somewhat
at
sea
she
greeted
rosy
quite
pleasantly
but
seemed
to
be
looking
about
for
the
captain
the
dry
shrewd
face
of
her
husband
adjusted
its
expression
readily
enough
to
the
matter
before
them
he
was
a
born
manager
and
manipulator
when
he
could
not
juggle
with
a
dollar
for
profit
he
was
content
to
juggle
with
a
penny
for
pleasure
susan
bates
hastened
up
to
his
wife
at
once
and
kissed
her
roundly
so
good
of
you
to
come
and
on
sunday
too
never
mind
said
ingles
we
can
put
twice
as
much
on
the
plate
next
sunday
ingles
at
once
appropriated
william
bates
for
a
walk
through
the
framework
of
the
unfinished
dormitories
ingles
followed
with
bates
things
are
going
declared
susan
bates
we
shall
be
under
cover
in
a
week
and
ready
for
the
painters
no
plaster
asked
ingles
dear
me
no
two
coats
of
paint
will
be
quite
warm
enough
rosy
meanwhile
sat
upon
a
pack
of
shingles
under
a
young
which
grew
within
a
few
steps
of
the
water
paston
lay
at
her
feet
and
dug
in
the
sand
with
a
split
shingle
drawn
from
the
pack
while
the
other
young
people
tramped
and
frolicked
with
shrill
cries
through
the
dismantled
grove
and
unfinished
buildings
it
was
at
her
house
you
remember
that
i
first
met
you
said
paston
he
nodded
to
ingles
who
was
just
moving
by
with
the
reluctant
william
bates
and
a
handsome
house
too
declared
rosy
still
i
suppose
that
hers
or
even
bates
ca
be
compared
with
some
in
london
do
be
so
sure
rejoined
paston
he
thought
of
gardens
kensington
he
would
have
been
the
last
to
force
a
comparison
between
that
and
the
of
cecilia
ingles
a
house
is
no
better
for
being
more
than
a
home
he
said
somewhat
ruefully
rosy
was
far
from
subscribing
to
this
her
ideal
home
was
one
that
had
been
immemorially
a
palace
and
a
with
troops
of
servants
to
show
the
troops
of
tourists
through
all
these
places
around
here
are
nice
enough
she
acknowledged
but
new
that
one
over
there
now
she
pointed
across
the
lake
to
the
roofs
and
gables
of
a
large
set
on
a
wooded
they
have
had
to
stain
it
green
to
make
it
look
old
and
mossy
sometimes
the
appearance
of
age
is
to
be
preferred
to
the
reality
observed
paston
thoughtfully
his
mind
was
on
boxton
park
witham
essex
and
he
was
wishing
devoutly
enough
that
means
were
available
for
keeping
that
in
a
state
of
fresh
repair
equal
to
the
state
of
the
house
where
he
was
now
staying
but
rosy
was
entertaining
her
own
vision
of
boxton
park
it
was
a
spacious
and
glorious
domain
and
its
noble
manor
house
was
a
perfect
commingling
of
picturesqueness
and
modern
comfort
and
the
peacocks
paraded
again
on
the
terrace
rosy
shifted
her
seat
on
the
pile
of
shingles
in
order
to
take
a
more
general
view
of
the
landscape
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
slightly
no
lanes
no
no
weirs
no
coppices
what
the
matter
with
these
maples
asked
fasten
abandoning
himself
to
the
american
idiom
and
where
are
there
handsomer
elms
than
right
here
in
wisconsin
and
what
have
you
against
those
hills
he
thought
of
the
wide
flatness
of
essex
what
would
not
boxton
park
give
for
a
foothold
on
such
a
shore
a
prospect
over
such
a
sheet
of
rippling
blue
but
rosy
had
her
own
conception
of
essex
in
some
miraculous
way
it
combined
the
sweetness
of
devonshire
the
fatness
of
warwick
the
boldness
of
westmorland
the
severity
of
cornwall
and
through
this
enchanting
tract
the
ever
sped
in
full
cry
paston
gave
a
sudden
dig
with
his
shingle
and
a
lump
of
damp
sand
fell
with
a
splash
far
out
upon
the
water
but
after
all
it
dear
old
england
he
said
plaintively
the
dearest
land
in
all
the
world
i
sure
sighed
rosy
sympathetically
she
dug
her
toe
at
a
single
tuft
of
coarse
grass
in
the
midst
of
the
sand
and
wondered
over
his
after
all
indeed
it
is
you
would
like
it
i
sure
i
know
i
should
i
shall
never
be
happy
until
i
seen
it
but
think
of
me
four
thousand
miles
away
from
it
i
do
said
rosy
softly
we
younger
sons
sighed
paston
in
a
tone
of
great
we
younger
daughters
echoed
rosy
with
an
implication
that
all
the
drawbacks
were
not
on
one
side
the
rest
of
the
party
came
flocking
down
to
the
shore
the
ingleses
among
them
to
see
the
others
off
i
suppose
you
go
back
as
you
came
said
ingles
to
paston
pretty
nearly
replied
paston
in
the
cheery
tone
he
usually
adopted
for
general
converse
and
back
he
went
with
this
small
difference
that
on
the
return
he
occupied
the
place
of
william
bates
xix
truesdale
returned
home
from
wisconsin
after
an
absence
of
ten
or
twelve
days
he
came
back
without
having
visited
geneva
he
had
visited
madison
however
his
feeling
as
he
traversed
the
streets
of
that
pleasant
capital
was
distinctly
one
of
pique
to
be
hemmed
in
to
be
barred
out
to
be
shut
up
to
be
cut
off
to
be
turned
aside
any
and
all
of
these
things
seemed
to
have
been
suffered
by
him
he
felt
them
as
stripes
or
as
fetters
applied
to
the
degradation
of
an
inexpugnable
personality
i
shall
not
take
it
so
passively
as
they
think
he
said
his
friendly
but
tempered
interest
in
bertie
patterson
had
risen
to
a
higher
pitch
in
view
of
the
insensate
safeguards
thrown
around
her
by
her
friends
besides
he
felt
himself
at
a
juncture
where
he
must
not
permit
himself
to
falter
in
the
maintenance
of
his
own
dignity
i
shall
not
be
balked
so
easily
as
they
imagine
he
said
he
paused
before
a
large
white
which
stood
on
a
kind
of
banked
terrace
the
house
was
shaded
by
a
number
of
evergreens
and
was
shut
in
from
the
street
by
a
this
must
be
it
he
said
as
he
clicked
the
latch
of
the
gate
patterson
as
one
of
the
large
retail
merchants
of
the
town
was
of
course
a
prominent
citizen
his
residence
was
easy
enough
to
find
patterson
is
at
home
he
uttered
with
the
appropriate
inflection
and
extended
his
card
he
made
this
tender
to
a
woman
of
forty
in
a
plain
black
dress
who
came
to
the
door
with
a
towel
in
her
hand
i
am
patterson
she
said
she
read
the
card
there
was
no
doubt
of
her
appreciation
of
his
identity
the
more
picturesque
and
decorative
phases
of
his
character
had
been
presented
to
her
doubtless
by
the
docile
and
transparent
bertie
by
letter
possibly
the
less
approved
side
concerning
which
bertie
own
conception
was
in
all
likelihood
darkling
enough
still
had
probably
come
to
her
also
by
letter
from
bertie
conscientious
but
disappointed
guardian
truesdale
dexterously
insinuated
himself
into
the
house
he
had
instantly
perceived
with
a
pang
of
mortification
that
no
formal
encouragement
to
enter
was
likely
to
be
extended
my
daughter
said
patterson
coldly
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
is
visiting
friends
in
watertown
this
was
true
she
is
to
remain
several
days
this
was
not
true
bertie
was
expected
home
on
the
morrow
but
it
was
made
true
for
all
purposes
by
an
instant
message
which
permitted
the
girl
to
extend
the
period
of
her
visit
truesdale
bowed
himself
out
of
the
house
with
no
apparent
diminution
of
grace
and
prestige
how
inexhaustible
are
the
beauties
of
nature
he
thought
wisconsin
nature
i
must
make
another
before
long
four
or
five
days
later
he
sat
in
his
bedroom
looking
over
a
number
of
that
covered
the
counterpane
and
largely
obscured
the
pillows
views
of
green
lake
scenes
from
the
rocks
and
gorges
of
the
upper
wisconsin
i
done
very
well
he
thought
very
well
indeed
he
was
trying
to
make
himself
believe
that
he
had
successfully
accomplished
the
principal
object
of
his
trip
rosy
also
returned
from
wisconsin
at
about
the
same
time
with
an
air
of
calm
decision
she
announced
to
her
mother
her
engagement
to
arthur
paston
she
regarded
this
statement
as
definitive
an
admission
towards
which
the
others
of
the
family
advanced
with
a
doubting
reluctance
jane
by
reason
of
the
place
and
of
her
own
participation
in
the
hopes
of
susan
bates
thought
the
proceeding
characterized
by
indelicacy
if
not
by
disloyalty
truesdale
on
receipt
of
the
intelligence
vented
a
jarring
laugh
he
saw
little
reason
why
paston
should
have
succeeded
at
geneva
when
he
himself
had
failed
at
madison
he
was
conscious
here
of
forcing
the
terms
in
order
to
compass
a
striking
antithesis
and
that
it
should
have
been
his
own
sister
whose
hand
paston
had
won
seemed
to
him
a
triumph
greater
and
more
discordant
still
david
marshall
himself
heard
these
tidings
with
a
grave
concern
it
all
seemed
like
another
weight
added
to
the
load
under
which
he
was
already
staggering
he
debated
with
himself
on
the
subject
of
this
proposed
new
household
where
was
it
to
be
established
of
whom
was
it
to
be
composed
by
whom
above
all
was
it
to
be
supported
marshall
in
his
most
prosperous
and
least
careworn
days
had
never
acquired
the
useful
and
agreeable
art
of
spending
money
the
outlay
of
any
considerable
sum
had
always
afflicted
him
as
with
a
physical
pain
how
much
greater
then
was
his
shrinking
dread
when
demands
upon
him
were
doubling
up
so
finely
and
when
the
last
demand
of
all
was
on
behalf
of
an
alien
who
might
well
attempt
to
make
an
alien
of
his
daughter
too
he
talked
with
rosy
about
her
future
in
a
hesitating
and
perturbed
fashion
rosy
would
set
her
lips
and
eye
him
coldly
and
tell
him
that
he
did
not
love
her
in
the
meantime
the
new
house
progressed
towards
its
and
it
was
jane
daily
speculation
whether
the
boudoir
designed
for
rosy
would
ever
be
occupied
by
her
or
by
somebody
else
by
somebody
else
she
was
afraid
for
since
that
luckless
sunday
dinner
theodore
brower
had
called
but
twice
and
had
been
as
distant
as
if
he
had
not
come
at
all
a
few
weeks
after
the
intrusion
of
paston
upon
the
board
another
piece
was
happily
removed
this
removal
involved
as
is
often
the
case
in
such
manipulations
a
certain
amount
of
sharp
playing
and
a
large
element
of
sacrifice
truesdale
when
the
recital
was
made
to
him
in
his
office
showed
a
scant
appreciation
of
the
sacrifice
but
listened
interestedly
enough
to
the
detailed
report
of
roger
endeavor
so
you
have
found
monsieur
y
after
all
and
do
you
hold
him
fast
roger
contemptuously
ignored
this
revival
of
his
brother
flippant
gallic
formula
he
contented
himself
with
giving
a
brief
and
stern
account
of
the
processes
that
he
had
been
driven
to
employ
he
had
prosecuted
his
inquiries
through
one
of
those
agencies
which
even
the
highest
respectability
may
be
compelled
upon
occasion
to
fall
back
on
and
he
had
arrived
at
an
acquaintance
with
the
leppins
in
all
their
grovelling
ramifications
equal
to
the
previous
one
which
he
had
achieved
with
the
van
horns
his
close
inquiries
had
extended
through
the
ranks
of
all
their
associates
and
connections
and
in
the
end
he
had
lighted
upon
one
individual
whose
disposition
towards
sophie
leppin
and
her
family
could
be
made
to
serve
the
end
in
view
this
young
man
was
the
foreman
of
a
tailor
establishment
and
roger
wasted
no
more
consideration
upon
him
than
upon
the
rest
of
them
before
the
assembled
horde
he
made
his
proposition
with
a
blunt
brutality
which
almost
startled
him
at
the
moment
and
which
disgusted
him
with
himself
for
a
fortnight
to
follow
and
they
accepted
it
more
shame
for
me
more
shame
for
them
more
shame
for
human
nature
but
are
safe
he
viewed
truesdale
with
an
undisguised
scorn
and
truesdale
did
not
attempt
to
withstand
it
i
attended
the
ceremony
roger
said
grimly
i
presented
the
bride
with
a
bouquet
for
the
matter
of
that
he
continued
in
a
scornful
jest
of
himself
i
was
the
one
who
took
out
the
marriage
license
did
you
pay
the
minister
his
fee
truesdale
asked
this
principally
for
the
purpose
of
reasserting
himself
minister
cried
roger
half
shocked
no
i
had
a
justice
of
the
peace
i
was
the
guest
of
honor
he
went
on
with
a
savage
irony
with
good
reason
it
was
i
who
paid
the
bride
dowry
truesdale
sat
with
his
eyes
on
the
floor
the
check
was
it
was
it
a
large
one
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
check
cried
roger
again
i
paid
them
in
bills
his
fingers
played
back
and
forth
many
and
many
times
not
so
much
as
that
exclaimed
truesdale
his
eyes
opening
widely
more
said
roger
i
put
the
notices
in
the
newspapers
too
and
now
truesdale
he
said
with
a
final
brief
phrase
of
dismissal
think
what
your
father
and
i
have
had
to
do
for
you
and
try
to
be
a
man
and
he
turned
away
towards
other
matters
truesdale
passed
out
crestfallen
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
not
over
his
own
follies
not
over
the
anxieties
and
expenditures
he
had
caused
his
father
but
over
the
fact
that
roger
had
treated
him
like
a
boy
and
had
done
it
all
so
briefly
he
blushed
too
for
the
vulgar
ending
of
the
episode
if
ended
indeed
it
were
for
it
seemed
to
outrage
all
literary
and
artistic
precedent
no
farce
at
the
palais
royal
had
ever
developed
so
grotesque
a
d√©nouement
no
novel
of
v√©ron
of
belot
of
mont√©pin
had
ever
come
to
so
sordid
an
ending
no
mimi
no
musette
could
have
ever
followed
a
line
of
conduct
so
little
as
that
taken
by
sophie
leppin
what
then
were
the
books
wrong
and
only
life
true
no
it
was
the
fault
of
america
itself
reflected
truesdale
equally
without
the
atmosphere
of
art
and
the
atmosphere
of
intrigue
this
observation
pleased
him
he
felt
that
he
had
pierced
the
marrow
of
a
complicated
question
and
he
passed
along
the
street
holding
a
higher
head
he
drew
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
creased
it
thoughtfully
in
his
hands
as
he
walked
on
the
envelope
from
which
he
did
not
draw
the
enclosure
was
addressed
in
the
hand
of
gladys
mckenna
he
had
parted
from
her
just
as
he
had
meant
to
part
at
the
carriage
door
she
had
forgiven
this
and
was
now
writing
in
terms
no
less
ardent
and
clinging
than
before
poor
gladys
he
said
half
aloud
i
have
treated
her
any
too
well
yet
she
is
about
the
only
one
who
cares
for
me
or
understands
me
or
appreciates
me
i
glad
though
she
back
home
i
should
be
guilty
of
some
horrible
or
other
if
she
were
here
all
the
same
he
made
her
absence
seem
another
deprivation
he
included
it
in
the
catalogue
of
his
injuries
and
woes
i
declare
he
said
take
it
all
together
and
it
enough
to
drive
a
man
to
business
it
surprise
me
very
much
to
be
talking
with
father
about
that
very
thing
within
a
month
or
so
for
what
can
a
man
of
leisure
do
after
all
in
such
a
town
as
this
but
the
summer
moved
onward
and
truesdale
still
considerately
refrained
from
harassing
an
anxious
and
overburdened
father
with
the
further
task
of
contriving
a
harmony
between
such
a
son
and
such
a
the
old
man
was
left
to
recover
from
the
sting
inflicted
by
the
leppins
to
study
over
the
future
of
his
youngest
daughter
to
keep
a
careful
eye
upon
his
business
associates
and
to
combat
as
one
combats
the
alkali
dust
of
the
plains
all
the
insinuating
minutiae
of
the
new
home
of
the
marshalls
moved
on
with
the
summer
and
reached
in
due
course
the
stage
when
such
elemental
features
as
walls
and
roofs
gave
way
to
the
minor
considerations
involved
in
the
swinging
of
doors
the
placing
of
and
the
arrangements
of
pantries
eliza
marshall
now
began
to
appear
more
frequently
on
the
scene
and
to
confound
both
architect
and
builder
after
the
fashion
possible
for
the
experienced
and
accomplished
she
usually
exacted
the
support
of
her
husband
with
a
pertinacity
the
greater
for
the
smallness
of
the
point
at
issue
and
david
marshall
wearied
and
borne
down
with
more
important
more
vital
affairs
wished
daily
that
the
new
house
had
never
been
undertaken
at
all
thomas
bingham
stood
eliza
marshall
annoying
with
the
patience
proper
to
a
friend
of
the
family
and
he
took
advantage
of
the
same
position
to
press
further
upon
her
husband
his
own
continuing
sense
of
a
rich
man
duties
towards
the
public
marshall
may
be
said
by
this
time
to
have
fixed
himself
in
the
general
eye
he
had
made
a
second
public
address
the
skilful
product
of
jane
literary
knack
and
of
his
own
previous
experience
as
a
consequence
of
this
he
had
been
asked
to
sit
on
one
or
two
platforms
and
to
sign
two
or
three
addresses
and
petitions
and
though
his
indifferent
health
and
his
many
preoccupations
had
somewhat
impeded
his
advance
yet
his
felt
the
marked
disposition
shown
to
concede
him
the
place
that
they
held
him
entitled
to
take
bingham
experienced
a
personal
interest
in
marshall
maintenance
of
the
foothold
thus
won
as
the
two
toured
through
the
rooms
or
stooped
to
consider
the
question
of
sewerage
amid
the
litter
of
the
basement
bingham
with
a
tactful
seriousness
would
urge
the
old
man
as
he
had
urged
him
often
enough
before
to
crown
his
career
and
perpetuate
his
memory
by
the
erection
of
some
enduring
structure
for
the
public
good
and
use
all
of
my
experience
is
at
your
disposal
he
would
say
and
all
of
your
own
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
over
the
chaos
prevailing
about
them
the
old
man
would
give
him
a
sidelong
glance
half
smiling
half
protesting
i
glad
to
have
you
acknowledge
bingham
that
there
is
some
experience
involved
in
building
a
house
there
a
good
deal
more
than
i
expected
you
not
having
a
hard
time
of
it
returned
bingham
you
realize
how
easy
i
been
making
it
for
you
but
marshall
was
coming
to
develop
a
firm
reluctance
towards
turning
the
knowledge
gained
in
his
private
building
to
the
erection
of
some
larger
and
different
building
for
the
public
good
with
every
month
of
the
past
year
had
his
estimate
of
the
public
and
its
character
been
modified
by
the
kind
of
treatment
that
he
had
suffered
from
certain
of
the
less
worthy
members
of
it
the
van
horns
seemed
to
have
passed
the
goad
on
to
the
leppins
and
it
was
largely
under
these
merciless
proddings
that
he
had
formed
his
conception
of
the
new
town
which
had
evolved
itself
during
the
past
twenty
years
to
these
personal
grievances
he
added
the
general
grievances
of
a
under
the
present
r√©gime
and
there
were
days
when
he
thought
he
saw
the
legitimate
outcome
of
democracy
as
applied
to
large
capitals
the
organizing
of
criminals
for
the
spoliation
of
the
and
if
bingham
had
pushed
him
too
hard
he
might
have
precipitated
the
blunt
declaration
that
a
man
best
use
for
his
own
money
was
to
protect
himself
and
his
interests
from
the
depredations
of
an
alien
and
rabble
populace
but
babylon
itself
was
built
of
mud
bricks
bingham
would
rejoin
and
the
noblest
mountain
in
the
world
when
you
come
right
down
to
details
is
only
a
heap
of
dirt
and
rocks
strewn
over
with
sticks
and
stones
but
if
you
will
just
step
back
far
enough
to
get
the
proper
point
of
view
well
you
know
what
the
painters
can
do
with
such
things
as
these
i
ca
step
back
bingham
i
started
here
i
stayed
here
i
belong
here
i
living
right
your
mountain
and
its
sticks
and
stones
are
all
about
me
do
ask
me
to
see
them
for
anything
else
do
ask
me
to
call
them
anything
else
then
he
would
say
to
bingham
what
he
said
later
to
susan
bates
when
she
came
with
jane
to
view
the
wainscotings
and
the
panelled
ceilings
of
the
long
succession
of
rooms
that
the
man
who
met
all
the
legal
exactions
of
the
community
and
all
the
needs
and
requirements
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
was
doing
quite
enough
for
the
preservation
of
his
own
credit
and
when
theodore
brower
cautiously
suggested
that
the
bitterness
of
certain
experiences
might
be
turned
to
sweetness
by
the
institution
of
a
bureau
of
justice
for
the
poor
and
unfriended
the
sensitive
old
man
shrank
back
as
if
from
contact
with
a
nettle
indeed
it
is
probable
that
so
unconventional
and
untravelled
a
road
to
philanthropic
renown
would
have
proven
uninviting
to
his
feet
at
any
time
and
jane
who
after
the
failure
of
her
own
idea
had
transferred
her
support
to
the
idea
of
brower
now
made
a
second
transfer
and
came
to
the
support
of
the
idea
of
susan
bates
if
she
could
do
nothing
for
the
cause
of
labor
and
nothing
for
the
cause
of
justice
she
was
willing
to
accomplish
what
she
could
for
the
cause
of
education
under
such
urgings
as
these
david
marshall
began
irritably
to
impugn
the
motives
of
those
men
whose
philanthropic
disposition
had
earned
for
them
the
approval
of
the
one
was
actuated
by
vanity
and
vainglory
another
by
political
ambitions
a
third
took
to
philanthropy
as
to
the
current
fad
there
might
be
worse
ones
bingham
would
retort
sixty
or
seventy
years
ago
the
fad
hereabouts
was
is
the
present
one
an
improvement
on
that
you
bring
up
ingles
the
other
went
on
he
simply
philanthropic
as
an
additional
vent
to
his
own
energies
you
talk
about
bates
he
merely
makes
all
those
benefactions
to
please
his
wife
and
so
with
others
is
that
a
bad
motive
the
wish
to
please
one
wife
by
a
generous
deed
i
have
wife
to
please
returned
marshall
his
observation
came
out
with
a
sort
of
raw
and
awkward
directness
it
seemed
to
convey
the
odd
implication
that
the
way
to
please
this
wife
would
be
not
to
do
a
generous
deed
but
to
refrain
from
doing
it
and
bingham
who
appreciated
the
saplessness
of
eliza
marshall
sympathies
and
the
narrowness
of
her
horizon
made
no
effort
to
give
his
friend
remark
a
more
favorable
aspect
marshall
derived
support
not
only
from
the
narrow
selfishness
of
his
wife
but
also
from
the
fastidiousness
of
his
younger
son
who
met
with
open
derision
any
project
involving
the
accomplishment
of
a
piece
of
actual
architecture
he
improvised
an
ornate
and
airy
edifice
of
his
own
which
he
allowed
them
to
dedicate
to
art
to
education
to
charity
to
what
you
will
then
he
festooned
it
with
telegraph
wires
and
draped
it
with
and
girdled
it
with
a
stretch
of
elevated
road
and
hung
it
with
signboards
and
hedged
it
in
with
and
swathed
it
in
clouds
of
coal
smoke
and
then
asked
them
to
find
it
that
was
the
puzzle
he
said
his
view
of
the
town
architectural
conditions
as
too
debased
to
justify
one
serious
endeavors
towards
improvement
was
so
nearly
in
harmony
with
the
view
that
his
father
inflamed
mind
sometimes
took
of
the
town
social
conditions
that
the
two
were
dangerously
near
to
the
common
ground
upon
which
they
had
never
yet
met
bingham
would
have
completely
dissented
from
all
this
of
course
and
he
agreed
with
marshall
no
better
as
regarded
the
precarious
condition
of
his
affairs
being
disposed
to
assume
that
the
old
man
depression
over
his
business
was
due
largely
to
the
multiplied
checks
on
his
own
control
of
it
nor
any
better
as
regarded
his
unusual
domestic
expenses
present
just
past
or
just
about
to
come
he
was
mindful
of
the
but
looked
upon
it
with
roger
as
an
investment
he
knew
of
the
thousands
extorted
through
truesdale
but
made
the
loss
less
than
might
have
resulted
from
a
maladroit
barter
in
real
estate
for
example
he
could
anticipate
too
the
demands
foreshadowed
by
the
coming
marriage
of
rosamund
but
a
considerable
expenditure
for
a
favorite
daughter
at
the
most
important
juncture
of
her
life
was
not
unprecedented
he
even
found
some
ameliorating
circumstances
for
the
persistent
pressure
which
roger
and
his
affairs
were
now
coming
to
bring
upon
the
paternal
estate
roger
who
had
served
so
valiantly
his
father
and
his
family
and
who
was
now
demanding
a
compensatory
assistance
amid
the
thickening
risks
and
dangers
of
his
own
business
operations
not
only
had
he
extricated
truesdale
from
his
difficulties
but
he
had
supported
his
father
in
his
demand
for
the
dismissal
of
the
unseemly
andreas
leppin
from
the
business
he
shall
go
cried
david
marshall
with
a
trembling
voice
and
a
shaking
hand
which
without
reinforcement
would
have
constituted
but
a
feeble
demonstration
he
shall
stay
returned
belden
with
a
cold
insolence
he
is
useful
to
me
besides
he
has
suffered
enough
wrong
from
you
already
he
shall
go
cried
roger
rising
into
a
threatening
savagery
over
the
brazen
hypocrisy
of
such
a
pretence
if
he
is
here
another
hour
i
will
drag
him
out
with
my
own
hands
the
young
man
seemed
to
tear
out
all
his
powers
from
his
own
person
as
one
draws
a
sword
from
its
sheath
and
to
wield
his
vehemence
and
indignation
over
belden
head
as
one
might
sweep
a
burning
brand
he
exercised
the
compelling
power
that
is
to
be
attained
sometimes
only
by
the
free
and
impassioned
employment
of
all
one
energies
he
seemed
capable
of
an
instant
physical
violence
in
more
directions
than
one
and
he
carried
his
point
another
outbreak
of
passion
followed
when
he
applied
to
his
father
for
assistance
during
a
precarious
passage
through
the
risks
and
dangers
of
an
expanding
business
and
was
met
with
reluctant
excuses
that
seemed
the
very
acme
of
ingratitude
he
hurled
forth
an
indignant
reminder
of
all
the
services
he
had
performed
for
the
family
services
at
once
degrading
and
gratuitous
and
he
demanded
if
a
year
dabbling
in
such
delectable
detail
were
not
a
sufficient
warrant
for
asking
the
help
that
he
now
required
in
fact
he
hectored
his
father
as
unscrupulously
as
unceremoniously
as
he
had
browbeaten
belden
david
marshall
met
as
well
as
he
could
the
demands
of
his
choleric
son
never
before
had
he
been
trampled
on
by
one
of
his
own
children
he
almost
seemed
to
see
the
moral
fibre
of
roger
nature
coarsening
perhaps
disintegrating
under
his
very
eyes
and
he
asked
himself
half
reproachfully
how
much
this
might
be
due
to
tasks
of
his
own
imposition
all
these
things
had
their
place
in
his
mind
as
he
followed
bingham
through
the
new
house
scuffing
over
the
floors
watching
the
adjustment
of
or
drawing
back
before
the
long
thin
strips
of
moulding
brought
in
by
carpenters
no
his
children
did
not
love
him
there
was
rosy
who
had
learned
her
lesson
of
selfishness
from
the
world
all
too
early
and
who
now
in
her
preoccupations
for
the
future
had
less
thought
of
him
than
ever
there
was
alice
who
saw
him
often
enough
if
she
saw
him
half
a
dozen
times
a
year
and
whose
infrequent
comings
always
disclosed
some
petty
motive
of
domestic
finance
and
economics
there
was
truesdale
a
flippant
and
insolent
egotist
who
had
neither
affection
nor
respect
for
his
own
parents
his
own
family
his
own
birthplace
there
was
roger
who
hewed
roughly
his
own
independent
course
and
who
did
not
scruple
to
turn
his
powers
against
his
own
father
if
crossed
in
his
desires
or
balked
in
his
ambitions
and
there
was
no
not
jane
she
is
the
only
one
of
them
all
who
really
loves
me
he
said
he
was
standing
in
one
of
the
upper
rooms
under
the
crude
light
of
a
northern
window
on
the
yellow
ground
beneath
him
a
workman
was
stacking
up
sheets
of
blue
slate
in
regular
piles
and
from
some
remote
quarter
of
the
place
came
the
sharp
metallic
hammerings
of
the
last
remaining
plumbers
the
searching
daylight
lit
up
cruelly
the
hollows
of
the
old
man
eyes
and
brought
out
from
his
whitened
chin
and
cheeks
the
last
few
threads
of
dim
and
dulling
red
his
tall
thin
figure
shrank
away
from
its
loose
coverings
never
before
had
he
seemed
so
detached
so
impersonal
so
slightly
poised
on
any
mere
physical
basis
he
turned
to
bingham
this
will
be
room
jane
room
it
must
be
right
whatever
the
others
are
jane
cares
for
me
she
has
always
been
a
dutiful
daughter
never
a
trial
never
a
disappointment
nothing
but
a
comfort
there
must
be
no
shortcoming
here
bingham
bingham
standing
beside
him
at
the
window
fixed
an
intent
regard
upon
the
sheets
of
shifting
slate
there
was
a
moist
smile
in
his
eyes
and
a
warm
glow
of
sympathetic
appreciation
permeated
his
whole
being
there
wo
be
he
said
and
jane
chamber
took
on
shape
and
finish
in
the
minds
of
the
two
men
who
stood
there
side
by
side
overlooking
the
slate
piles
and
saying
no
word
further
and
neither
recognized
in
her
the
first
cause
of
all
these
changes
and
of
the
many
trials
and
difficulties
proceeding
from
them
xx
the
approaching
completion
of
the
new
house
did
little
towards
diminishing
the
rigors
of
the
daily
routine
within
the
old
one
no
greater
insistence
upon
detail
could
be
encountered
at
gibraltar
or
at
ehrenbreitstein
than
that
which
prevailed
under
the
direction
of
eliza
marshall
to
whom
the
near
breaking
of
camp
was
no
reason
for
the
slightest
break
in
discipline
nor
was
there
any
relaxation
because
the
garrison
happened
to
be
on
a
mere
peace
footing
it
made
little
difference
that
both
rosamund
and
truesdale
were
spending
the
better
part
of
the
summer
in
wisconsin
rosy
had
resumed
her
round
among
the
of
her
friends
she
expected
to
repay
these
attentions
in
the
near
future
by
an
elegant
and
lavish
hospitality
whose
time
place
and
method
still
remained
more
or
less
indeterminate
truesdale
too
had
made
a
second
and
longer
excursion
northward
waukesha
geneva
oconomowoc
and
again
madison
jane
alone
remained
at
home
and
it
was
she
who
helped
her
mother
through
the
thirtieth
and
last
of
the
annual
for
the
first
time
in
all
these
years
the
entire
supply
of
currants
had
come
from
outside
the
last
of
their
own
bushes
which
had
put
on
faintly
its
customary
greenness
in
may
had
peaked
and
dwindled
through
june
and
had
died
at
last
in
the
early
days
of
july
that
reconciles
me
jane
said
eliza
marshall
as
she
viewed
the
dead
bush
while
flapping
one
of
her
ensanguined
cloths
from
the
kitchen
window
i
shall
be
ready
to
move
when
the
time
comes
jane
sighed
softly
for
reply
she
was
beginning
to
realize
what
all
this
change
might
mean
david
marshall
himself
bowed
to
the
same
stringent
discipline
that
ruled
the
others
though
he
felt
his
powers
weakening
beneath
days
of
worry
and
nights
of
broken
rest
he
would
have
been
surprised
by
the
smallest
concession
and
would
even
have
considered
it
a
weakness
to
ask
for
any
that
his
rest
was
broken
did
not
postpone
the
early
breakfast
by
a
single
five
minutes
that
his
health
was
failing
did
not
alter
the
somewhat
primitive
and
rigorous
character
of
the
dishes
set
before
him
that
he
returned
home
jaded
and
exhausted
by
the
day
doings
did
not
entitle
him
any
more
than
ever
to
smoke
a
quiet
cigar
within
doors
he
smoked
without
upon
the
sidewalk
according
to
his
wont
but
he
never
paced
very
far
up
or
down
nor
very
long
the
old
routine
went
on
a
little
too
inexorably
and
though
many
of
his
nights
were
coming
to
be
sleepless
throughout
and
though
the
strain
of
it
all
was
obvious
enough
as
his
thin
drawn
face
bent
over
a
breakfast
for
which
he
could
find
no
relish
yet
the
tradition
that
he
was
above
all
physical
frailties
and
exempt
from
all
natural
laws
clamped
its
curious
hold
upon
his
family
and
even
upon
himself
eliza
marshall
had
almost
come
to
regard
him
as
she
regarded
his
business
each
was
a
respectable
and
estimable
abstraction
which
held
its
own
without
too
direct
a
heed
from
her
each
an
admirable
contrivance
that
had
accomplished
its
purposes
so
long
and
with
so
trustworthy
a
regularity
that
the
thought
of
hitch
lapse
failure
never
presented
itself
as
a
really
tangible
consideration
each
day
he
grew
a
shade
paler
a
degree
feebler
but
the
change
came
too
gradually
for
the
unobservant
and
eyes
of
his
wife
rosy
noticed
it
however
when
she
came
back
to
town
to
begin
seriously
her
preparations
for
her
wedding
i
do
think
papa
looks
very
well
she
was
contented
to
observe
of
course
he
does
returned
jane
anxiously
he
ought
to
go
off
somewhere
for
a
change
and
rest
i
told
him
so
a
dozen
times
to
rosy
ought
to
know
plenty
of
places
if
i
had
my
way
about
it
he
would
start
off
well
i
do
know
observed
her
mother
slowly
he
never
gone
off
and
if
you
do
happen
to
feel
i
do
know
where
you
can
be
better
taken
care
of
than
right
at
home
you
might
go
to
geneva
both
of
you
replied
jane
i
wish
you
would
if
only
on
my
account
bates
is
just
about
getting
tired
of
asking
you
and
i
worn
out
with
making
up
excuses
for
your
not
going
jane
had
been
giving
an
occasional
attendance
on
susan
bates
dormitory
and
children
bates
herself
had
bowed
to
rosy
preference
with
a
resigned
reasonableness
and
had
abated
not
one
jot
in
her
friendliness
towards
rosy
family
but
to
eliza
marshall
a
summer
outing
could
easily
be
made
to
seem
superfluous
impracticable
revolutionary
nor
did
jane
succeed
any
better
with
her
father
himself
he
seemed
to
take
a
pathetic
pride
in
standing
at
his
post
he
almost
appeared
to
be
imbued
with
the
fatalistic
notion
that
there
was
indeed
no
leaving
it
he
continued
to
smoke
his
cigar
outside
to
cover
haltingly
sheets
of
paper
with
figures
under
the
library
lamp
and
to
yield
himself
to
hours
of
depressing
and
harassing
reflection
within
the
shadows
of
the
when
truesdale
came
home
his
father
decline
was
even
more
noticeable
truesdale
commented
briefly
on
his
appearance
suggested
as
briefly
a
little
trip
into
the
country
and
after
these
few
passes
at
filial
duty
he
concentrated
his
attention
upon
his
own
personal
affairs
on
his
second
visit
to
madison
he
had
met
bertie
patterson
face
to
face
he
had
encountered
her
in
one
of
the
broad
and
leafy
walks
before
the
capitol
and
she
was
in
company
with
another
young
man
one
of
those
students
thought
truesdale
as
he
noted
the
smooth
face
and
slender
immaturity
of
her
escort
they
swarm
the
town
is
full
of
them
what
chance
has
anybody
else
against
them
bertie
showed
him
a
little
face
at
once
surprised
startled
puzzled
she
bowed
slightly
and
gave
him
a
smile
which
seemed
to
him
timid
shrinking
and
amusingly
deferential
but
she
showed
no
disposition
to
pause
or
even
to
slacken
her
pace
she
does
know
after
all
he
thought
she
is
imagining
some
vague
horror
or
other
that
is
too
dreadful
to
be
true
or
even
possible
bertie
and
her
youth
passed
on
through
the
contending
sun
and
shade
of
the
path
can
they
be
engaged
thought
truesdale
upon
whom
certain
fine
shades
in
posture
and
address
were
not
thrown
away
he
looks
hardly
a
junior
he
presently
met
a
senior
of
his
acquaintance
who
told
him
he
understood
they
were
ouf
commented
truesdale
further
a
mere
affair
and
he
pleased
himself
with
thinking
how
his
own
participation
in
such
an
affair
would
give
it
a
much
greater
maturity
and
weight
but
as
regarded
this
particular
one
he
definitely
withdrew
from
all
participation
whatever
he
had
now
done
enough
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
or
his
interest
as
he
might
have
preferred
to
have
it
called
and
fully
enough
to
preserve
the
dignity
so
absurdly
jeoparded
by
the
fantastic
scruples
of
his
aunt
lydia
he
presently
dismissed
the
whole
matter
and
fell
to
bestowing
an
exaggerated
care
upon
the
tips
of
his
brushes
the
rest
of
the
summer
i
propose
to
enjoy
he
declared
as
for
david
marshall
himself
he
employed
the
rest
of
the
summer
in
a
laborious
attempt
to
form
the
acquaintance
of
his
coming
presented
to
him
an
assemblage
of
qualities
towards
whose
scheduling
and
comprehending
he
received
but
little
help
from
his
familiarity
with
the
ordinary
workaday
type
of
local
young
man
paston
was
uniformly
gay
jovial
companionable
definite
sometimes
as
regarded
particulars
indefinite
always
as
regarded
generals
he
stood
constantly
in
a
lambent
flicker
of
humorous
and
he
baffled
the
old
gentleman
as
one
is
baffled
by
the
play
of
sunshine
over
a
rippling
pool
marshall
would
ask
himself
whether
the
depth
of
the
pool
was
a
or
a
fathom
and
would
speculate
on
what
there
might
be
lying
at
the
bottom
of
it
strange
deposits
perhaps
representing
the
social
and
business
developments
of
another
age
or
at
least
another
civilization
he
sometimes
questioned
his
daughter
capacity
to
cope
with
the
classification
of
such
a
collection
supposing
so
exacting
a
task
ever
to
devolve
upon
her
he
sometimes
canvassed
the
matter
with
theodore
brower
as
the
two
sat
smoking
together
on
the
through
the
long
summer
twilights
while
other
loungers
scuffled
aimlessly
over
the
cindered
paths
of
the
dingy
opposite
or
lying
on
their
backs
crossed
their
legs
and
lifted
brogans
towards
the
contemptuous
stars
he
opened
himself
unreservedly
to
brower
as
to
a
friend
of
the
family
and
brower
could
not
but
feel
that
his
two
years
attendance
at
the
house
with
thus
far
no
definite
outcome
had
given
the
head
of
it
ample
warrant
for
considering
him
as
he
did
once
or
twice
while
brower
was
counselling
with
x
marshall
on
the
another
man
tom
bingham
had
been
entertained
by
jane
within
the
breezy
recesses
of
the
it
was
then
that
brower
realized
with
a
kind
of
muffled
desperation
how
completely
he
and
bingham
seemed
to
have
changed
positions
one
had
begun
as
the
friend
of
a
single
member
of
the
family
to
become
in
the
end
the
common
and
equal
friend
of
all
and
to
sit
discussing
now
with
the
head
of
it
as
one
with
another
the
other
had
begun
as
the
general
friend
of
the
household
and
had
now
advanced
to
the
stage
where
he
could
fill
in
the
dusk
of
an
early
september
evening
with
the
talk
and
company
of
the
one
young
woman
in
the
world
whose
talk
and
company
were
in
any
degree
worth
considering
brower
crunched
his
cigar
between
his
teeth
and
replied
to
observations
with
a
brusque
carelessness
for
which
he
rebuked
himself
as
being
neither
respectful
nor
civil
i
had
never
thought
said
the
old
gentleman
looking
lakeward
through
the
smoky
twilight
with
a
kind
of
vague
wistfulnes
but
that
all
my
girls
would
marry
americans
he
spoke
slowly
musingly
in
his
huskily
sibilant
tones
um
said
brower
moodily
from
the
depth
of
an
absurd
jealousy
the
man
whose
voice
was
coming
to
them
with
a
certain
deep
indistinctness
from
the
was
an
american
decidedly
so
and
not
only
an
american
pursued
marshall
but
a
westerner
um
said
brower
with
an
increasing
gloom
the
man
who
had
just
provoked
that
last
clouded
response
from
jane
was
a
westerner
truly
and
not
only
a
western
man
but
an
chicago
man
one
who
knows
the
town
one
who
is
in
sympathy
with
it
one
who
has
done
a
little
something
to
make
it
what
it
is
um
said
brower
once
more
with
a
deeper
despondency
who
had
done
more
to
make
the
town
what
it
was
than
bingham
had
done
then
i
should
understand
his
ideas
and
ambitions
the
old
man
proceeded
in
a
tone
of
plaintive
yet
unavailing
protest
i
should
know
better
about
his
connections
and
belongings
i
should
be
able
to
foresee
the
future
in
some
degree
i
should
have
a
clearer
idea
of
what
to
expect
i
should
know
perhaps
where
he
where
he
meant
to
live
marshall
ended
this
discourse
with
a
feeble
and
helpless
sigh
there
was
nothing
indefinite
about
bingham
thought
poor
brower
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
where
would
continue
to
exist
you
mean
to
say
it
is
decided
yet
where
they
are
going
to
live
brewer
inquiry
was
prompted
by
civility
rather
than
by
interest
it
was
the
first
observation
of
any
length
that
he
had
made
for
some
time
jane
who
had
been
straining
her
ears
during
the
last
ten
minutes
for
the
mere
sound
of
his
voice
leaned
back
in
her
chair
with
an
approximate
comfort
i
do
know
just
exactly
replied
marshall
rather
dismally
his
tone
made
him
say
that
he
did
not
know
at
all
i
talked
with
rosy
and
talked
with
arthur
he
lapsed
into
a
comfortless
silence
and
ran
his
thin
old
hand
over
his
blanched
and
furrowed
forehead
when
are
they
going
to
be
married
asked
brower
his
eyes
were
on
the
through
whose
curtains
there
showed
the
face
of
bingham
his
own
look
anxiously
fixed
on
marshall
jane
caught
indistinctly
the
muffled
tone
of
these
few
syllables
she
made
them
mean
a
dozen
different
things
and
finally
nothing
at
all
but
she
was
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
do
even
that
in
a
month
answered
marshall
early
in
october
rosy
lays
great
stress
on
an
october
wedding
that
the
only
right
sort
it
seems
he
sighed
with
a
full
sense
of
the
imminence
of
the
inevitable
the
voice
of
bingham
came
with
a
slow
deep
gravity
from
the
and
voice
responding
mingled
nervously
with
her
father
sigh
not
from
the
new
house
said
brower
hardly
it
will
be
almost
finished
but
far
from
furnished
perhaps
they
will
have
their
receptions
there
if
they
decide
to
to
come
back
come
back
brower
spoke
up
loudly
a
jangling
freight
train
had
paused
opposite
and
the
locomotive
was
blowing
off
steam
to
america
the
old
man
explained
he
laid
his
hands
to
his
temples
do
you
sleep
well
always
rosy
thinks
the
new
house
ought
to
be
hurried
more
but
why
should
she
object
to
being
married
from
the
old
house
she
was
born
in
most
girls
would
be
pleased
with
such
a
thought
as
that
he
placed
his
hand
over
his
weary
old
eyes
you
do
do
you
always
i
do
i
ca
these
trains
they
keep
me
awake
i
slept
hardly
half
an
hour
last
night
and
none
at
all
the
night
before
do
you
know
anything
about
chloral
the
voice
of
bingham
came
to
a
pause
and
that
of
jane
was
presently
distinguished
in
response
trembling
apprehensive
lapsing
away
into
little
breaks
and
pauses
i
know
it
dangerous
replied
brower
and
morphine
too
and
all
such
things
they
not
to
be
used
except
in
the
last
extremity
so
they
are
going
to
england
for
their
then
to
england
yes
he
smiled
half
sorrowfully
half
bitterly
he
was
thinking
how
easy
it
might
be
for
rosamund
to
give
up
her
old
home
and
her
old
friends
altogether
and
he
was
asking
himself
too
if
he
had
really
toiled
through
these
many
years
only
to
have
the
results
squandered
at
last
by
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
to
england
yes
he
repeated
arthur
has
postponed
his
vacation
until
late
in
the
fall
and
he
hopes
to
be
able
to
spend
as
much
as
two
or
three
weeks
at
home
at
home
he
is
a
british
subject
you
know
he
has
never
been
naturalized
the
air
quivered
with
the
quick
pulsations
of
the
locomotive
of
a
passing
suburban
train
as
it
moved
away
brower
heard
again
the
voice
of
bingham
slow
grave
earnest
a
voice
of
warning
and
alarm
one
might
have
thought
some
of
them
are
here
for
years
before
they
take
out
their
papers
rejoined
brower
and
lots
of
them
never
take
them
out
at
all
i
do
know
what
to
be
done
said
marshall
with
a
fretful
anxiety
i
given
up
coffee
some
tell
me
that
i
ought
to
give
up
smoking
too
but
others
say
it
really
does
make
any
difference
but
i
must
do
something
i
must
have
better
rest
i
ca
work
without
my
sleep
and
i
i
ca
let
myself
fail
now
jane
was
speaking
once
again
more
steadily
more
coolly
more
composedly
it
seemed
poor
pa
it
ca
be
so
serious
as
that
the
listener
thought
he
understood
her
to
say
i
heard
of
bromine
said
brower
that
simpler
is
it
and
safer
jane
voice
had
ceased
and
silence
maintained
its
sway
within
she
will
meet
all
his
family
the
old
gentleman
went
on
she
seems
to
expect
to
find
them
very
fine
people
finer
than
any
we
have
here
and
she
will
see
the
place
where
they
live
a
very
much
handsomer
place
i
make
out
than
any
in
this
part
of
the
world
a
drawn
and
weary
smile
passed
lightly
over
his
face
there
was
a
movement
in
the
and
presently
a
solid
footstep
in
the
hall
there
nothing
like
finding
things
out
for
yourself
said
brower
colorlessly
bingham
appeared
on
the
just
as
the
tail
of
locomotive
smoke
swept
over
the
front
yard
will
you
smoke
with
us
asked
marshall
brower
smiled
though
neither
of
the
others
seemed
conscious
of
any
secondary
meaning
in
this
simple
question
thank
you
no
replied
bingham
i
am
moving
on
to
an
appointment
and
am
a
little
late
as
it
is
he
looked
down
on
marshall
with
an
expression
of
friendly
solicitude
and
shook
hands
with
him
in
a
long
slow
clasp
you
are
entitled
to
better
care
than
you
are
giving
yourself
and
he
moved
down
the
footpath
towards
the
front
gate
marshall
looked
after
him
wistfully
if
i
were
only
in
that
man
shoes
if
i
but
had
half
his
health
and
strength
brower
heard
nothing
of
this
he
was
straining
his
ears
for
a
further
sound
from
within
i
must
get
rest
cried
the
old
man
pitifully
i
wearing
out
i
stay
up
till
midnight
and
after
every
night
and
even
then
it
sometimes
daylight
before
i
have
a
minute
sleep
i
ca
stand
it
nobody
can
there
was
a
sound
inside
as
of
scuffling
among
the
furniture
it
was
jane
feeling
her
way
through
the
dark
listening
for
the
sound
of
theodore
brower
voice
and
murmuring
tremulously
with
her
own
fid√®le
toujours
fid√®le
what
can
i
do
asked
the
old
man
with
an
appealing
grip
on
arm
what
doctor
can
i
see
where
can
i
go
for
a
change
and
for
rest
or
how
he
groaned
can
i
go
away
at
all
they
are
crowding
me
down
they
are
wrenching
my
business
from
my
hands
i
ca
give
way
at
such
a
time
as
this
brower
hardly
heard
him
he
was
listening
for
jane
who
was
now
doubling
the
just
within
and
whose
quavering
undertone
broke
at
the
turn
as
she
chanted
once
more
her
phrase
of
hope
and
reassurance
brower
heard
her
intonation
and
wondered
over
its
meaning
but
he
would
have
found
no
meaning
in
the
words
themselves
even
if
they
had
been
distinctly
audible
for
he
knew
no
french
jane
crooned
the
same
brief
snatch
of
melody
many
a
time
as
the
preparations
for
her
sister
wedding
moved
along
particularly
during
those
hours
when
she
sat
in
her
own
room
and
directed
the
invitations
it
was
the
only
which
she
remembered
ever
to
have
occupied
the
same
furniture
the
same
fireplace
the
same
outlook
the
same
familiar
curtains
that
had
been
known
to
her
tomboy
childhood
to
her
formidably
plain
girlhood
to
her
ambitious
and
philanthropic
spinsterhood
the
very
air
of
it
seemed
thick
with
her
varying
hopes
and
plans
and
dreams
and
projects
and
ideals
in
this
retired
bower
she
had
slept
for
her
whole
life
and
no
fairy
prince
had
ever
penetrated
to
it
to
awaken
her
one
had
come
for
alice
and
one
for
rosy
but
never
a
fid√®le
moaned
jane
in
her
deepest
contralto
and
fell
to
work
with
renewed
zeal
upon
her
envelopes
there
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
rosy
had
imagined
a
function
of
the
first
magnitude
and
it
was
not
to
dwindle
for
mere
lack
of
material
she
had
determined
upon
a
ceremony
in
church
and
a
large
reception
at
the
house
with
everything
in
the
way
of
music
flowers
functionaries
and
supernumeraries
that
the
most
approved
forms
could
incorporate
she
stood
out
for
a
bishop
a
surpliced
choir
a
after
the
english
manner
in
short
for
the
utmost
attainable
in
the
way
of
spendor
thoroughness
and
distinction
the
preparations
moved
on
with
a
swirl
and
a
sweep
and
involved
the
whole
household
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
but
for
heaven
sake
demanded
jane
how
are
you
going
to
get
all
these
people
into
the
house
she
had
already
disposed
of
paston
short
list
and
had
even
found
a
certain
pleasure
in
the
quaint
and
complicated
addresses
that
abounded
throughout
it
but
the
other
list
compiled
by
rosy
and
her
mother
seemed
to
pass
all
bounds
not
her
mother
part
which
was
limited
to
certain
friends
and
connections
but
own
which
dealt
with
society
almost
in
its
entirety
jane
appreciated
now
for
the
first
time
the
comprehensive
thoroughness
of
year
of
social
endeavor
here
let
me
have
it
said
rosy
brusquely
snatching
the
list
from
jane
she
fixed
her
eye
upon
the
part
of
it
that
was
written
in
her
mother
cramped
and
antiquated
hand
who
are
these
browns
why
do
you
remember
the
browns
they
were
old
neighbors
of
ours
pa
used
to
think
everything
of
them
they
sent
alice
a
beautiful
present
never
heard
of
them
in
my
life
declared
rosy
they
need
come
they
can
just
have
who
are
the
grahams
here
four
of
them
why
faltered
jane
they
used
to
have
the
pew
right
behind
us
in
the
old
church
ma
and
graham
had
a
booth
together
at
the
sanitary
fair
the
pew
behind
eh
i
have
the
slightest
recollection
of
them
she
marked
the
name
off
altogether
she
made
a
thorough
revision
of
her
mother
list
then
she
turned
to
her
own
now
people
i
all
of
and
am
indebted
to
them
and
expect
to
have
relations
with
them
after
i
come
back
all
got
to
stay
on
very
good
said
jane
meekly
what
else
could
she
say
was
it
not
to
some
such
social
triumph
as
this
that
for
a
good
six
months
she
had
bent
all
her
own
endeavors
she
tried
now
to
make
the
triumph
seem
as
glorious
as
it
should
but
she
could
not
feel
that
she
was
succeeding
another
stage
in
the
proceeding
arrived
when
the
gowns
began
to
come
home
from
the
jane
then
laid
aside
her
pen
to
find
pins
to
contrive
ruchings
to
catch
up
the
loose
ends
of
draperies
while
her
mother
and
her
sister
alice
and
her
aunt
lydia
circled
and
fluttered
and
swooped
and
chattered
through
a
hundred
suggestions
and
amendments
and
alterations
then
jane
would
stand
upon
the
threshold
and
blink
tearfully
and
indignantly
into
the
gloom
of
the
hall
nobody
thinks
of
she
would
say
chokingly
nobody
cares
for
me
nobody
seems
to
imagine
that
i
got
a
heart
too
and
lastly
the
day
itself
when
truesdale
decorated
with
a
daring
and
wanton
orchid
followed
paston
out
into
the
middle
of
the
chancel
of
a
crowded
and
buzzing
church
when
his
father
despite
his
failing
powers
and
an
innate
repugnance
to
the
conscious
dramatization
involved
in
the
ceremonial
side
of
life
led
rosamond
up
a
long
aisle
with
the
tremulous
embarrassment
of
an
invalid
and
a
novice
and
parted
from
her
in
front
of
a
broad
pair
of
lawn
sleeves
and
when
cecilia
ingles
scattered
a
wide
shower
of
rice
over
the
broken
flagging
of
the
old
front
walk
as
and
arthur
of
boxton
park
witham
essex
england
as
one
of
the
newspapers
took
the
trouble
to
put
it
passed
out
through
the
rusty
old
front
gate
into
married
life
a
few
days
later
david
marshall
to
the
surprise
and
dismay
of
the
remaining
members
of
the
family
took
to
his
bed
xxi
where
are
you
jane
eliza
marshall
voice
sounded
impatiently
in
the
hallway
and
presently
her
nervous
hand
was
placed
on
the
knob
of
her
daughter
door
well
here
you
are
finally
and
what
is
the
matter
for
the
sake
and
where
is
the
pillow
you
went
to
get
for
your
father
we
keep
him
waiting
out
in
the
carriage
on
such
a
day
as
this
come
get
up
you
catch
your
death
of
cold
yourself
jane
was
lying
on
the
bare
floor
of
her
stripped
and
emptied
room
with
her
head
pillowed
upon
the
she
wore
her
sack
but
her
hat
had
fallen
off
and
lay
at
her
side
in
her
hand
she
held
a
stiff
and
curling
width
of
paper
just
torn
from
the
wall
and
her
body
shook
with
sobs
as
she
lifted
her
wide
and
welling
eyes
to
her
mother
face
i
am
to
blame
she
cried
wildly
i
am
to
blame
for
it
all
if
it
had
been
for
me
we
should
never
have
left
our
old
home
and
given
up
our
old
life
and
rosy
would
have
cut
all
our
friends
and
gone
to
england
to
live
and
truesdale
would
be
talking
about
starting
off
across
the
pacific
for
somewhere
or
other
and
we
should
never
have
made
enemies
of
those
beldens
and
poor
pa
would
have
lost
his
business
and
would
be
going
off
to
die
inch
by
inch
in
that
big
cold
place
out
on
the
prairie
i
to
blame
for
it
all
but
i
i
meant
as
well
as
anybody
could
jane
rosy
has
gone
to
england
to
live
and
your
father
dying
how
can
you
talk
that
way
and
my
old
room
jane
went
on
with
a
stringent
cry
as
her
eyes
roamed
despairingly
over
its
dismantled
walls
i
never
lived
anywhere
else
and
i
do
want
to
and
i
ca
i
do
want
to
live
at
all
and
this
old
house
is
ours
any
longer
and
those
carriage
people
will
begin
to
tear
it
down
they
take
away
the
barn
and
chop
down
the
trees
and
there
wo
be
a
single
thing
left
to
remember
it
all
by
she
bent
her
head
on
the
again
and
sobbed
more
vehemently
still
oh
jane
jane
cried
her
mother
protestingly
how
can
you
act
that
way
when
there
is
so
much
to
be
done
and
when
your
father
is
feeling
so
much
worse
than
usual
where
were
those
pillows
left
anyway
come
come
jane
rose
to
her
knees
and
tried
to
wipe
her
face
with
the
piece
of
then
her
mother
lifted
her
up
and
led
her
out
through
the
hall
it
was
a
chilly
day
in
early
november
a
high
wind
lashing
the
gray
and
foaming
lake
when
david
marshall
wrapped
in
shawls
and
bolstered
up
with
pillows
was
driven
carefully
over
the
three
miles
of
flinty
macadam
which
led
from
his
old
house
to
his
new
one
and
was
put
to
bed
again
in
a
large
apartment
fitted
up
scantily
and
provisionally
with
an
old
that
had
escaped
the
auctioneer
his
own
illness
and
his
daughter
marriage
had
almost
brought
the
furnishing
of
the
new
house
to
a
while
the
anxiety
of
the
purchasers
of
the
old
place
to
get
their
foundations
in
before
the
real
cold
weather
had
made
it
impossible
for
the
family
to
a
single
day
beyond
the
stipulated
term
no
new
furnishings
had
been
attempted
beyond
carpets
and
curtains
and
for
the
first
few
days
that
the
old
man
lay
in
these
new
quarters
he
had
little
to
assure
him
that
he
was
not
in
some
hotel
or
in
some
hospital
save
the
echoing
tread
of
the
in
other
rooms
about
him
the
first
slight
flurry
of
snow
dusted
the
dead
weeds
of
the
open
spaces
round
the
house
and
the
reflections
from
it
passed
through
the
clear
broad
panes
of
the
windows
to
strike
a
grimmer
chill
from
the
shimmering
surfaces
of
ash
and
oak
never
before
had
the
world
seemed
to
him
so
empty
and
so
cold
and
so
unsympathetic
and
when
his
own
wife
had
said
to
him
in
accents
almost
of
reproach
oh
david
david
how
could
you
take
such
a
time
as
this
to
be
sick
with
all
the
worry
of
moving
and
furnishing
and
rosy
wedding
and
everything
else
he
felt
as
bare
and
chill
and
numb
as
a
naked
sailor
cast
ashore
on
some
alien
and
inhospitable
coast
susan
bates
appeared
at
the
new
house
almost
immediately
she
felt
its
need
now
if
ever
of
being
habitable
she
stuffed
her
carriage
with
rugs
and
draperies
she
sent
an
expressman
out
with
her
favorite
she
brought
alcohol
lamps
and
she
seldom
came
without
fruit
or
flowers
she
set
and
adjusted
she
went
deeply
into
the
subject
of
opiates
and
she
talked
by
the
hour
with
jane
and
her
mother
about
symptoms
and
remedies
marshall
while
grateful
for
her
attentions
was
almost
embarrassed
by
them
not
that
they
should
come
from
her
rather
than
from
his
wife
or
at
least
more
copiously
and
spontaneously
but
that
they
should
come
at
all
never
before
in
his
life
had
he
received
such
minute
and
solicitous
ministrations
he
felt
with
a
shy
that
he
must
be
making
himself
a
great
burden
if
susan
bates
threw
back
her
and
suggested
to
jane
a
lowering
of
the
he
would
almost
protest
against
the
girl
laying
aside
her
book
or
her
sewing
and
the
preparation
of
any
special
dish
such
as
is
an
due
would
even
now
still
cause
him
that
sense
of
guilt
which
he
had
always
felt
on
breaking
in
upon
the
household
routine
of
his
wife
poor
man
susan
bates
would
say
how
must
he
have
lived
all
these
years
why
i
could
hardly
get
him
even
to
let
me
oil
the
she
would
sit
by
his
bedside
and
try
to
soothe
and
divert
this
wan
and
weary
and
old
man
he
enjoyed
but
the
most
fitful
slumber
and
even
that
only
by
the
action
of
narcotics
through
the
lagging
hours
of
the
day
and
through
the
maddening
watches
of
the
night
his
mind
ticking
like
an
unstillable
clock
beat
for
him
an
incessant
rhythmical
reminder
of
the
impending
ruin
of
his
house
and
of
his
own
powerlessness
to
avert
it
he
reviewed
again
and
again
the
whole
course
of
his
life
and
his
business
they
were
one
his
lowly
beginnings
his
early
struggles
in
the
raw
but
ambitious
prairie
town
the
laborious
stages
of
endeavor
by
which
he
had
developed
and
strengthened
his
business
his
then
as
the
house
had
grown
others
had
insinuated
themselves
or
imposed
themselves
and
these
were
now
banded
together
to
dominate
it
and
to
check
and
circumvent
him
its
founder
and
their
benefactor
and
finally
to
bring
it
to
the
very
brink
of
ruin
and
to
make
the
labors
of
his
whole
lifetime
come
to
naught
and
he
in
bed
here
with
his
feeble
hands
working
desperately
at
the
hem
of
the
sheet
and
his
aching
head
throbbing
unavailingly
through
the
cruel
watches
of
the
night
he
raged
over
the
world
injustice
and
his
own
impotence
the
thought
was
never
absent
from
him
he
was
coming
under
the
disastrous
domination
of
the
he
spoke
of
these
things
to
susan
bates
with
such
an
increasing
frequency
and
insistency
as
almost
to
transfer
the
rack
of
them
from
his
own
brain
to
hers
once
or
twice
in
an
interval
of
he
bewept
the
ruin
not
only
of
his
business
but
of
himself
and
of
his
family
and
of
all
his
belongings
he
infected
her
with
his
own
dread
and
panic
she
saw
his
property
dispersed
his
home
in
others
hands
his
family
in
the
depths
of
despairing
poverty
one
morning
she
appeared
at
roger
office
minnie
peters
accompanied
her
the
one
carried
a
large
leather
bag
in
her
hand
the
other
had
a
large
parcel
under
her
arm
your
poor
father
said
susan
bates
advancing
straight
towards
roger
with
moistened
eyes
and
with
a
nervous
tremor
in
her
voice
and
body
alike
she
set
her
satchel
on
the
corner
of
roger
desk
and
began
tugging
at
its
catches
you
open
yours
too
minnie
she
said
and
minnie
peters
began
working
at
the
knots
in
the
cord
that
bound
her
stiff
brown
bundle
with
a
tension
roger
looked
at
both
his
callers
with
a
great
surprise
poor
david
said
susan
bates
with
her
lips
twitching
to
think
of
his
toiling
and
slaving
so
many
years
and
of
everything
going
all
to
pieces
in
the
end
like
this
it
ca
be
it
be
not
if
i
can
help
it
she
thrust
her
hand
into
the
top
of
minnie
peter
package
she
drew
out
a
heavy
folded
document
and
followed
it
with
others
there
that
the
abstract
and
here
are
the
leases
and
here
is
the
insurance
she
threw
out
a
sheaf
of
policies
the
one
on
top
was
for
ten
thousand
dollars
i
did
know
just
what
you
would
need
i
brought
everything
connected
with
the
whole
building
here
the
receipt
for
last
year
taxes
now
i
want
you
to
put
a
mortgage
on
it
right
away
it
clear
bates
says
roger
glanced
at
one
of
the
leases
and
placed
the
building
in
an
instant
it
was
a
vast
structure
in
the
district
occupied
by
half
a
dozen
firms
of
the
highest
standing
bates
now
thrust
her
hand
into
her
own
bag
she
drew
it
out
time
and
time
again
until
she
had
covered
the
top
of
roger
desk
with
packages
of
securities
bank
stock
railroad
bonds
state
and
county
issues
of
all
kinds
there
was
even
one
batch
of
water
bonds
from
a
far
town
in
north
dakota
roger
looked
up
at
her
very
gravely
is
this
with
bates
approval
susan
bates
answered
him
pantingly
all
with
nervous
excitement
bates
is
a
just
man
and
not
an
ungenerous
man
but
but
she
clasped
her
hands
and
leaned
forward
anxiously
bates
and
i
have
always
stepped
along
together
he
has
always
done
whatever
i
have
asked
him
to
do
he
has
never
disappointed
me
but
oh
roger
he
never
knew
your
father
in
those
early
days
if
he
had
could
he
stand
by
and
see
him
on
the
edge
of
ruin
without
making
some
effort
to
save
him
she
waved
her
hand
over
the
disorder
of
roger
desk
that
everything
i
got
use
as
much
of
it
as
you
need
she
began
to
cry
a
little
minnie
peters
who
always
cried
when
she
could
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
and
frankly
sobbed
aloud
roger
studied
the
two
women
with
some
perplexity
and
with
a
slight
shade
of
pique
it
is
true
he
began
very
proudly
and
much
too
coldly
that
the
affairs
of
the
marshall
belden
company
are
moving
towards
the
hands
of
a
receiver
but
the
affairs
of
david
marshall
himself
are
in
the
hands
of
his
son
and
they
were
never
in
better
condition
than
they
are
this
was
roger
song
of
victory
over
his
recent
success
with
the
largest
operation
on
behalf
both
of
his
father
and
of
himself
that
he
had
ever
undertaken
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
world
must
know
of
that
must
ring
with
it
in
fact
yet
it
was
this
very
hour
which
benevolence
had
now
chosen
for
the
precipitation
of
her
golden
shower
susan
bates
gave
a
little
gasp
then
then
you
do
need
it
never
less
replied
roger
with
a
quivering
nostril
and
a
high
slow
bow
susan
bates
looked
sidewise
at
minnie
peters
and
asked
her
to
behave
herself
but
she
gave
a
few
hysterical
sobs
on
her
own
part
and
minnie
peters
echoed
them
with
a
faithful
promptitude
just
like
a
woman
thought
roger
as
he
sat
alone
after
susan
departure
he
drew
a
hundred
lines
on
an
imaginary
sheet
of
paper
with
a
dry
pen
like
a
woman
yes
he
added
under
the
promptings
of
a
feeling
for
more
exact
justice
a
woman
in
ten
thousand
a
few
mornings
later
when
this
woman
in
ten
thousand
was
standing
in
the
bleak
porch
of
the
new
house
to
await
the
return
of
her
horses
from
their
last
walk
up
and
down
another
carriage
slipped
into
its
place
and
another
woman
alighted
on
the
curbstone
susan
bates
immediately
squared
her
shoulders
banished
all
expression
from
her
face
and
began
the
descent
of
the
steps
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
gaps
in
the
broken
building
line
over
the
way
that
woman
she
has
never
entered
house
and
she
never
shall
and
she
should
never
enter
this
statira
belden
had
come
to
do
the
decencies
eliza
marshall
received
her
with
the
grim
inexpressiveness
of
a
granite
bowlder
my
husband
is
resting
quietly
she
said
in
response
to
belden
inquiries
he
was
unconscious
under
chloral
after
three
nights
of
torment
belden
passed
one
of
her
large
smooth
gloves
over
the
other
and
praised
the
house
it
is
one
of
the
handsomest
on
the
street
replied
eliza
marshall
firmly
and
one
of
the
best
built
we
feel
completely
at
home
in
it
already
but
in
truth
the
poor
soul
was
homesick
heartsick
as
lost
and
forlorn
as
a
shipwrecked
sailor
on
the
chill
coast
of
kamtchatka
belden
smoothed
down
her
yellow
locks
and
deplored
in
her
thickly
sweet
accents
the
unfortunate
condition
of
the
business
my
husband
own
affairs
are
going
very
well
returned
eliza
marshall
looking
forward
with
unblinking
eyes
my
son
has
charge
of
them
there
was
a
full
account
of
his
success
in
the
sunday
paper
her
tone
was
one
of
brazen
triumph
yet
eliza
marshall
abhorred
speculation
with
all
the
dread
of
the
female
conservative
one
dollar
through
legitimate
trade
rather
than
ten
through
such
paths
as
roger
had
of
late
been
so
fearfully
treading
belden
had
heard
something
of
truesdale
intended
departure
for
the
orient
he
finds
chicago
uncongenial
no
doubt
truesdale
is
at
home
everywhere
he
will
have
adventures
everywhere
he
is
handsome
he
is
clever
he
can
interest
wherever
he
chooses
sometimes
he
interests
too
easily
and
too
deeply
sometimes
in
spite
of
himself
and
to
his
own
annoyance
eliza
marshall
shot
out
these
remarks
like
bullets
from
behind
a
breastwork
at
the
end
she
set
her
jaws
firmly
and
stared
at
statira
belden
with
a
proud
defiance
many
a
night
had
truesdale
courses
wet
her
pillow
with
tears
of
sorrow
and
shame
she
now
wondered
if
it
were
really
she
herself
who
had
just
celebrated
his
profligacy
and
had
seemed
to
glory
in
it
at
that
she
had
surmised
her
son
disdain
for
the
importunities
of
gladys
mckenna
and
she
had
joined
with
him
in
a
ringing
derision
when
the
beldens
had
accused
him
of
encouraging
her
in
her
folly
that
he
might
employ
her
as
a
spy
upon
the
happenings
in
their
house
my
son
she
concluded
will
return
at
his
own
pleasure
and
will
always
be
welcome
under
his
father
roof
statira
belden
eyes
sought
the
floor
it
was
she
who
had
made
it
sure
that
knowledge
of
truesdale
transgression
should
reach
the
ears
of
susan
bates
yet
her
own
son
had
just
established
relations
with
a
baroness
who
still
lingered
behind
on
the
scene
of
the
late
national
festivities
and
at
the
climax
of
an
insane
extravagance
had
been
openly
cast
off
by
his
family
and
rosy
said
statira
belden
presently
with
a
reconquered
sweetness
one
would
expect
to
find
her
home
at
such
a
time
as
this
eliza
marshall
planted
her
standard
upon
her
breastwork
and
flaunted
it
with
a
firm
and
magnificent
spirit
my
daughter
rosamund
will
be
with
us
inside
of
a
week
she
has
been
detained
longer
than
she
had
expected
among
her
husband
family
the
old
lady
rose
with
a
stiff
slow
motion
and
transferred
a
large
panel
photograph
from
the
to
statira
belden
hands
this
reached
us
yesterday
it
was
rosamund
her
proud
and
splendid
young
beauty
was
set
off
by
a
an
immense
bouquet
and
a
nodding
group
of
presented
at
court
exclaimed
statira
belden
involuntarily
and
bit
her
tongue
a
second
after
eliza
marshall
answered
neither
yes
nor
no
she
let
the
photograph
speak
for
itself
rosamund
she
went
on
presently
may
return
a
little
too
late
for
her
first
reception
but
the
others
will
be
held
here
and
she
will
entertain
a
great
deal
during
the
winter
statira
belden
was
cowed
at
last
and
eliza
marshall
heart
beat
high
to
see
it
this
was
her
only
compensation
for
the
tears
shed
over
the
delayed
return
of
a
selfish
and
unfilial
daughter
for
the
anticipated
ordeal
of
the
gay
social
happenings
which
were
to
follow
that
return
for
the
besetting
thought
that
some
dread
misfortune
might
displace
all
this
future
festivity
by
a
worse
alternative
and
make
the
lightest
diversion
a
black
impossibility
she
kissed
the
queen
hand
palpitated
statira
belden
with
an
interest
that
she
could
not
stifle
and
again
eliza
marshall
answered
neither
yes
nor
no
rosamund
had
not
kissed
the
queen
hand
but
her
husband
family
had
been
so
fascinated
by
her
beauty
so
amazed
by
her
genius
for
dress
and
so
confounded
by
her
boundless
aplomb
that
one
of
them
had
suggested
that
she
attire
herself
in
a
costume
which
had
served
a
daughter
of
the
house
at
a
some
six
months
before
and
others
had
demanded
that
she
be
photographed
in
it
this
was
the
pleasantest
impression
that
rosy
brought
back
of
her
husband
family
their
generous
and
unbounded
appreciation
of
herself
her
other
impressions
were
less
acute
boxton
park
itself
she
had
found
comfortable
but
not
at
all
splendid
and
as
for
its
occupants
they
were
in
the
main
staid
and
serious
people
who
were
doing
what
they
could
to
justify
the
favors
that
fortune
had
bestowed
upon
them
rosy
sometimes
felt
that
in
general
terms
they
might
have
appreciated
jane
quite
as
fully
as
they
had
appreciated
her
they
were
not
gay
they
were
not
lively
they
were
not
like
arthur
paston
had
truly
described
himself
as
the
youngest
and
he
was
by
far
the
most
jovial
and
blithesome
rosy
had
not
delayed
her
return
on
account
of
any
presentation
at
court
though
the
achievement
of
the
photograph
may
have
accounted
for
a
few
days
more
or
less
but
on
account
of
the
which
had
completely
fascinated
her
horse
habit
and
country
were
all
in
perfect
accord
her
prosaic
and
practice
at
home
was
now
transmuted
into
the
purest
poetry
and
under
the
promptings
of
this
new
afflatus
she
developed
a
grace
and
a
daring
which
accomplished
the
final
and
irrevocable
conquest
of
all
her
husband
family
rosy
continued
sojourn
in
england
cost
her
husband
his
position
and
prospects
in
america
where
he
was
not
of
enough
importance
to
assume
such
liberties
but
this
mattered
nothing
to
his
wife
she
had
lived
for
more
than
a
fortnight
at
the
seat
of
a
county
family
she
had
breathed
the
air
of
deference
that
exists
for
the
gentry
of
the
shires
and
she
was
far
from
any
thought
of
a
permanent
submission
to
the
rasping
crudities
of
provincial
america
she
had
already
developed
the
fixed
determination
to
return
to
london
for
the
season
to
accomplish
an
actual
presentation
at
court
and
to
make
england
her
future
home
for
the
rest
of
her
days
one
thing
more
was
lost
by
rosamund
delay
in
essex
all
chance
of
a
last
recognition
from
her
father
when
she
finally
reached
home
he
was
in
a
state
of
slight
delirium
and
when
he
passed
from
that
it
was
to
enter
into
unconsciousness
his
ideas
ran
incessantly
on
gifts
on
philanthropic
endeavor
he
built
an
asylum
he
endowed
a
hospital
he
strewed
promises
over
the
counterpane
with
indefatigable
hands
and
babbled
unending
benefactions
among
his
hot
and
harassing
pillows
jane
half
mad
with
anguish
and
remorse
found
an
added
pang
in
the
recollection
that
during
one
of
his
conscious
and
least
uncomfortable
hours
he
had
yielded
to
her
solicitations
and
those
of
susan
bates
and
had
set
apart
a
certain
portion
of
his
estate
with
the
approval
of
roger
for
a
collegiate
building
which
was
to
bear
his
name
he
will
be
remembered
now
said
jane
for
all
her
poignant
sorrow
and
she
was
glad
that
roger
had
to
make
this
step
a
possibility
she
tried
not
to
see
too
plainly
that
her
father
had
made
no
pretence
of
a
keener
sense
of
his
duty
towards
the
public
or
of
a
kindlier
disposition
towards
it
whatever
he
had
done
was
on
personal
grounds
for
the
pleasure
of
a
daughter
and
of
an
old
friend
one
morning
a
week
after
rosamund
return
a
bow
of
crape
was
hanging
upon
the
susan
bates
was
busy
with
eliza
marshall
over
certain
apparel
and
roger
was
writing
down
a
list
of
names
and
addresses
for
theodore
brower
upon
the
table
we
must
have
eight
out
of
this
list
said
roger
to
brower
and
we
ought
to
know
by
night
which
of
them
can
serve
whose
names
have
you
put
down
asked
jane
reaching
for
the
paper
she
read
them
over
give
me
that
pencil
she
wrote
down
half
a
dozen
more
there
she
said
with
a
sort
of
frenzied
and
towering
pride
as
she
passed
the
sheet
on
to
brower
those
are
men
that
my
father
knew
and
they
are
men
who
must
help
us
now
roger
glanced
at
the
names
each
was
a
household
word
to
every
soul
throughout
the
city
try
said
jane
to
brower
and
if
any
of
them
refuse
you
they
will
have
to
refuse
me
later
and
she
walked
straight
out
of
the
room
without
turning
her
head
an
inch
to
right
or
left
shall
i
asked
brower
abashed
why
not
demanded
roger
with
a
laconic
severity
brower
was
a
quiet
retiring
fellow
and
entered
upon
his
day
work
with
a
full
consciousness
of
the
ordeal
it
meant
to
lean
over
the
desks
of
bank
presidents
to
intrude
upon
the
meetings
of
railway
directors
to
penetrate
to
the
of
judges
to
approach
more
than
one
of
the
magnates
whom
with
an
imposing
vagueness
we
call
capitalists
but
brower
carrying
the
thought
of
jane
with
him
into
all
these
presences
accomplished
his
task
with
modesty
tact
and
discretion
and
finally
from
the
few
simple
types
of
greatness
that
the
town
possesses
evolved
a
list
which
the
pride
of
the
dead
man
daughter
was
willing
to
accept
the
list
of
occupants
of
the
carriages
jane
made
out
herself
in
the
first
one
mother
and
roger
and
alice
and
her
husband
in
the
second
arthur
and
rosy
and
truesdale
and
me
in
the
third
aunt
lydia
and
the
bateses
it
will
be
full
if
lottie
and
william
both
come
i
can
do
much
for
aunt
lyddy
concluded
jane
with
a
rueful
yet
whimsical
smile
where
do
you
put
me
asked
brower
with
an
inviolate
sobriety
they
were
alone
in
the
together
in
the
fourth
you
and
bingham
and
i
do
want
to
go
in
the
carriage
with
bingham
interrupted
brower
why
theodore
what
do
you
mean
bingham
is
one
of
our
best
and
oldest
friends
who
is
there
that
has
been
kinder
to
poor
dear
pa
and
to
ma
and
to
me
nor
in
any
carriage
occupied
by
friends
he
went
on
in
the
same
tense
undertone
he
took
a
firm
grip
on
the
back
of
the
chair
beside
him
jane
saw
the
swelling
veins
of
his
hand
and
wondered
what
it
all
might
mean
i
want
to
go
in
one
of
the
carriages
for
the
family
i
want
to
go
in
the
carriage
that
go
in
do
you
understand
me
a
sudden
consciousness
had
swept
over
him
with
the
mention
of
name
that
he
himself
as
well
as
any
other
filled
measurably
the
dead
man
ideal
of
a
husband
for
one
of
his
daughters
he
had
waited
too
long
already
before
making
this
discovery
he
must
not
wait
so
long
before
declaring
it
she
did
not
understand
from
his
voice
which
was
strained
and
muffled
to
conceal
an
emotion
all
unconcealable
but
she
understood
from
his
eyes
which
looked
into
hers
with
an
immense
and
endless
kindness
and
from
his
hand
which
had
left
its
heroic
clutch
upon
the
chair
to
take
a
very
human
hold
upon
the
hand
which
hung
so
limply
by
her
side
do
you
understand
me
he
asked
again
and
his
voice
was
gentler
than
before
i
do
answered
jane
feebly
and
her
head
fell
upon
his
shoulder
nothing
ever
seemed
to
happen
to
her
as
to
anybody
else
but
if
happiness
chose
to
come
to
her
swathed
in
mourning
bands
none
the
less
kindly
and
thankfully
must
it
be
welcomed
and
as
she
reclined
against
him
she
breathed
a
sigh
of
thanks
that
not
he
but
bingham
had
been
concerned
in
the
laying
of
her
he
stood
beside
her
at
the
open
grave
and
supported
her
there
too
as
the
rattling
sand
and
gravel
rained
down
upon
the
coffin
the
grave
had
been
set
round
with
evergreen
sprays
and
the
raw
mound
of
earth
beside
it
had
been
concealed
in
the
same
kindly
fashion
but
jane
in
a
penance
would
spare
herself
no
pang
she
clutched
brower
arm
and
stood
there
motionless
until
the
grave
had
been
filled
in
and
the
overplus
of
earth
had
been
shaped
above
it
put
those
lilies
at
the
head
she
directed
they
were
from
mrs
bates
and
then
she
walked
away
she
read
the
next
day
with
a
chastened
satisfaction
the
newspaper
accounts
of
her
father
career
a
new
and
careless
public
was
carried
back
once
more
to
the
early
day
whose
revivification
is
always
attempted
for
a
preoccupied
and
unsympathetic
community
upon
the
passing
away
of
another
old
settler
then
the
frontier
village
lifts
once
more
its
bedraggled
forlornness
from
the
slime
of
its
humble
beginnings
and
the
lingering
presence
of
the
red
man
is
again
made
manifest
upon
the
grassy
horizon
again
the
struggles
of
the
early
days
are
rehearsed
again
fire
deals
out
its
awful
devastation
and
once
more
the
city
grows
from
an
indian
village
to
a
metropolis
of
two
millions
within
the
lifetime
of
a
single
individual
one
morning
the
second
after
the
funeral
truesdale
stood
at
the
front
parlor
window
while
the
first
of
the
season
swirled
over
the
long
reach
of
the
street
and
across
the
straggling
paths
that
traversed
the
wide
stretches
of
broken
prairie
land
round
about
on
the
chair
beside
him
was
a
newspaper
containing
the
statement
that
the
affairs
of
the
marshall
belden
company
were
to
be
wound
up
all
thought
of
continuing
the
business
having
been
abandoned
and
on
the
table
beside
him
lay
the
cards
which
announced
the
marriage
of
bertie
patterson
no
business
he
said
no
bride
he
feigned
to
himself
that
he
had
really
designed
going
into
his
father
office
and
that
he
had
had
a
serious
intention
of
asking
bertie
patterson
to
become
his
wife
he
looked
out
through
the
wide
clear
pane
and
thought
of
the
view
of
the
weather
of
the
hideous
hubbub
of
the
whole
town
ouf
what
a
prospect
what
a
climate
what
a
human
everything
unites
for
me
in
saying
japan
david
marshall
will
was
opened
this
same
day
it
made
japan
possible
for
truesdale
and
england
possible
for
rosamund
a
codicil
added
in
roger
hand
at
the
latest
practicable
moment
revoked
the
bequest
for
a
collegiate
building
and
transferred
the
whole
amount
of
it
directly
to
jane
this
must
make
any
difference
said
jane
to
brower
it
shall
go
for
that
after
all
my
father
was
a
good
man
and
he
deserves
to
be
remembered
brower
bowed
quietly
he
appreciated
the
gravity
of
this
their
joint
sacrifice
but
he
would
not
dispute
the
justness
of
it
the
end
