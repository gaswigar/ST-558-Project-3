a
treatise
concerning
the
principles
of
human
knowledge
by
george
berkeley
wherein
the
chief
causes
of
error
and
difficulty
in
the
sciences
with
the
grounds
of
scepticism
atheism
and
irreligion
are
inquired
into
dedication
to
the
right
honourable
thomas
earl
of
pembroke
knight
of
the
most
noble
order
of
the
garter
and
one
of
the
lords
of
her
majesty
most
honourable
privy
council
my
lord
you
will
perhaps
wonder
that
an
obscure
person
who
has
not
the
honour
to
be
known
to
your
lordship
should
presume
to
address
you
in
this
manner
but
that
a
man
who
has
written
something
with
a
design
to
promote
useful
knowledge
and
religion
in
the
world
should
make
choice
of
your
lordship
for
his
patron
will
not
be
thought
strange
by
any
one
that
is
not
altogether
unacquainted
with
the
present
state
of
the
church
and
learning
and
consequently
ignorant
how
great
an
ornament
and
support
you
are
to
both
yet
nothing
could
have
induced
me
to
make
you
this
present
of
my
poor
endeavours
were
i
not
encouraged
by
that
candour
and
native
goodness
which
is
so
bright
a
part
in
your
lordship
character
i
might
add
my
lord
that
the
extraordinary
favour
and
bounty
you
have
been
pleased
to
show
towards
our
society
gave
me
hopes
you
would
not
be
unwilling
to
countenance
the
studies
of
one
of
its
members
these
considerations
determined
me
to
lay
this
treatise
at
your
feet
and
the
rather
because
i
was
ambitious
to
have
it
known
that
i
am
with
the
truest
and
most
profound
respect
on
account
of
that
learning
and
virtue
which
the
world
so
justly
admires
in
your
lordship

lord

humble

devoted

introduction
of
the
principles
of
human
knowledge
preface
what
i
here
make
public
has
after
a
long
and
scrupulous
inquiry
seemed
to
me
evidently
true
and
not
unuseful
to
be
known
particularly
to
those
who
are
tainted
with
scepticism
or
want
a
demonstration
of
the
existence
and
immateriality
of
god
or
the
natural
immortality
of
the
soul
whether
it
be
so
or
no
i
am
content
the
reader
should
impartially
examine
since
i
do
not
think
myself
any
farther
concerned
for
the
success
of
what
i
have
written
than
as
it
is
agreeable
to
truth
but
to
the
end
this
may
not
suffer
i
make
it
my
request
that
the
reader
suspend
his
judgment
till
he
has
once
at
least
read
the
whole
through
with
that
degree
of
attention
and
thought
which
the
shall
seem
to
deserve
for
as
there
are
some
passages
that
taken
by
themselves
are
very
liable
nor
could
it
be
remedied
to
gross
misinterpretation
and
to
be
charged
with
most
absurd
consequences
which
nevertheless
upon
an
entire
perusal
will
appear
not
to
follow
from
them
so
likewise
though
the
whole
should
be
read
over
yet
if
this
be
done
transiently
it
is
very
probable
my
sense
may
be
mistaken
but
to
a
thinking
reader
i
flatter
myself
it
will
be
throughout
clear
and
obvious
as
for
the
characters
of
novelty
and
singularity
which
some
of
the
following
notions
may
seem
to
bear
it
is
i
hope
needless
to
make
any
apology
on
that
account
he
must
surely
be
either
very
weak
or
very
little
acquainted
with
the
sciences
who
shall
reject
a
truth
that
is
capable
of
demonstration
for
no
other
reason
but
because
it
is
newly
known
and
contrary
to
the
prejudices
of
mankind
thus
much
i
thought
fit
to
premise
in
order
to
prevent
if
possible
the
hasty
censures
of
a
sort
of
men
who
are
too
apt
to
condemn
an
opinion
before
they
rightly
comprehend
it
introduction
philosophy
being
nothing
else
but
the
study
of
wisdom
and
truth
it
may
with
reason
be
expected
that
those
who
have
spent
most
time
and
pains
in
it
should
enjoy
a
greater
calm
and
serenity
of
mind
a
greater
clearness
and
evidence
of
knowledge
and
be
less
disturbed
with
doubts
and
difficulties
than
other
men
yet
so
it
is
we
see
the
illiterate
bulk
of
mankind
that
walk
the
of
plain
common
sense
and
are
governed
by
the
dictates
of
nature
for
the
most
part
easy
and
undisturbed
to
them
nothing
that
is
familiar
appears
unaccountable
or
difficult
to
comprehend
they
complain
not
of
any
want
of
evidence
in
their
senses
and
are
out
of
all
danger
of
becoming
sceptics
but
no
sooner
do
we
depart
from
sense
and
instinct
to
follow
the
light
of
a
superior
principle
to
reason
meditate
and
reflect
on
the
nature
of
things
but
a
thousand
scruples
spring
up
in
our
minds
concerning
those
things
which
before
we
seemed
fully
to
comprehend
prejudices
and
errors
of
sense
do
from
all
parts
discover
themselves
to
our
view
and
endeavouring
to
correct
these
by
reason
we
are
insensibly
drawn
into
uncouth
paradoxes
difficulties
and
inconsistencies
which
multiply
and
grow
upon
us
as
we
advance
in
speculation
till
at
length
having
wandered
through
many
intricate
mazes
we
find
ourselves
just
where
we
were
or
which
is
worse
sit
down
in
a
forlorn
scepticism
the
cause
of
this
is
thought
to
be
the
obscurity
of
things
or
the
natural
weakness
and
imperfection
of
our
understandings
it
is
said
the
faculties
we
have
are
few
and
those
designed
by
nature
for
the
support
and
comfort
of
life
and
not
to
penetrate
into
the
inward
essence
and
constitution
of
things
besides
the
mind
of
man
being
finite
when
it
treats
of
things
which
partake
of
infinity
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
it
run
into
absurdities
and
contradictions
out
of
which
it
is
impossible
it
should
ever
extricate
itself
it
being
of
the
nature
of
infinite
not
to
be
comprehended
by
that
which
is
finite
but
perhaps
we
may
be
too
partial
to
ourselves
in
placing
the
fault
originally
in
our
faculties
and
not
rather
in
the
wrong
use
we
make
of
them
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
suppose
that
right
deductions
from
true
principles
should
ever
end
in
consequences
which
can
not
be
maintained
or
made
consistent
we
should
believe
that
god
has
dealt
more
bountifully
with
the
sons
of
men
than
to
give
them
a
strong
desire
for
that
knowledge
which
he
had
placed
quite
out
of
their
reach
this
were
not
agreeable
to
the
wonted
indulgent
methods
of
providence
which
whatever
appetites
it
may
have
implanted
in
the
creatures
doth
usually
furnish
them
with
such
means
as
if
rightly
made
use
of
will
not
fail
to
satisfy
them
upon
the
whole
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
far
greater
part
if
not
all
of
those
difficulties
which
have
hitherto
amused
philosophers
and
blocked
up
the
way
to
knowledge
are
entirely
owing
to
ourselves
that
we
have
first
raised
a
dust
and
then
complain
we
can
not
see
my
purpose
therefore
is
to
try
if
i
can
discover
what
those
principles
are
which
have
introduced
all
that
doubtfulness
and
uncertainty
those
absurdities
and
contradictions
into
the
several
sects
of
philosophy
insomuch
that
the
wisest
men
have
thought
our
ignorance
incurable
conceiving
it
to
arise
from
the
natural
dulness
and
limitation
of
our
faculties
and
surely
it
is
a
work
well
deserving
our
pains
to
make
a
strict
inquiry
concerning
the
first
principles
of
human
knowledge
to
sift
and
examine
them
on
all
sides
especially
since
there
may
be
some
grounds
to
suspect
that
those
lets
and
difficulties
which
stay
and
embarrass
the
mind
in
its
search
after
truth
do
not
spring
from
any
darkness
and
intricacy
in
the
objects
or
natural
defect
in
the
understanding
so
much
as
from
false
principles
which
have
been
insisted
on
and
might
have
been
avoided
how
difficult
and
discouraging
soever
this
attempt
may
seem
when
i
consider
how
many
great
and
extraordinary
men
have
gone
before
me
in
the
like
designs
yet
i
am
not
without
some
hopes
upon
the
consideration
that
the
largest
views
are
not
always
the
clearest
and
that
he
who
is
short
sighted
will
be
obliged
to
draw
the
object
nearer
and
may
perhaps
by
a
close
and
narrow
survey
discern
that
which
had
escaped
far
better
eyes
a
chief
source
of
error
in
all
parts
of
in
order
to
prepare
the
mind
of
the
reader
for
the
easier
conceiving
what
follows
it
is
proper
to
premise
somewhat
by
way
of
introduction
concerning
the
nature
and
abuse
of
language
but
the
unravelling
this
matter
leads
me
in
some
measure
to
anticipate
my
design
by
taking
notice
of
what
seems
to
have
had
a
chief
part
in
rendering
speculation
intricate
and
perplexed
and
to
have
occasioned
innumerable
errors
and
difficulties
in
almost
all
parts
of
knowledge
and
that
is
the
opinion
that
the
mind
has
a
power
of
framing
abstract
ideas
or
notions
of
things
he
who
is
not
a
perfect
stranger
to
the
writings
and
disputes
of
philosophers
must
needs
acknowledge
that
no
small
part
of
them
are
spent
about
abstract
ideas
these
are
in
a
more
especial
manner
thought
to
be
the
object
of
those
sciences
which
go
by
the
name
of
logic
and
metaphysics
and
of
all
that
which
passes
under
the
notion
of
the
most
abstracted
and
sublime
learning
in
all
which
one
shall
scarce
find
any
question
handled
in
such
a
manner
as
does
not
suppose
their
existence
in
the
mind
and
that
it
is
well
acquainted
with
them
proper
acceptation
of
it
is
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
qualities
or
modes
of
things
do
never
really
exist
each
of
them
apart
by
itself
and
separated
from
all
others
but
are
mixed
as
it
were
and
blended
together
several
in
the
same
object
but
we
are
told
the
mind
being
able
to
consider
each
quality
singly
or
abstracted
from
those
other
qualities
with
which
it
is
united
does
by
that
means
frame
to
itself
abstract
ideas
for
example
there
is
perceived
by
sight
an
object
extended
coloured
and
moved
this
mixed
or
compound
idea
the
mind
resolving
into
its
simple
constituent
parts
and
viewing
each
by
itself
exclusive
of
the
rest
does
frame
the
abstract
ideas
of
extension
colour
and
motion
not
that
it
is
possible
for
colour
or
motion
to
exist
without
extension
but
only
that
the
mind
can
frame
to
itself
by
abstraction
the
idea
of
colour
exclusive
of
extension
and
of
motion
exclusive
of
both
colour
and
extension
of
generalizing
note
again
the
mind
having
observed
that
in
the
particular
extensions
perceived
by
sense
there
is
something
common
and
alike
in
all
and
some
other
things
peculiar
as
this
or
that
figure
or
magnitude
which
distinguish
them
one
from
another
it
considers
apart
or
singles
out
by
itself
that
which
is
common
making
thereof
a
most
abstract
idea
of
extension
which
is
neither
line
surface
nor
solid
nor
has
any
figure
or
magnitude
but
is
an
idea
entirely
prescinded
from
all
these
so
likewise
the
mind
by
leaving
out
of
the
particular
colours
perceived
by
sense
that
which
distinguishes
them
one
from
another
and
retaining
that
only
which
is
common
to
all
makes
an
idea
of
colour
in
abstract
which
is
neither
red
nor
blue
nor
white
nor
any
other
determinate
colour
and
in
like
manner
by
considering
motion
abstractedly
not
only
from
the
body
moved
but
likewise
from
the
figure
it
describes
and
all
particular
directions
and
velocities
the
abstract
idea
of
motion
is
framed
which
equally
corresponds
to
all
particular
motions
whatsoever
that
may
be
perceived
by
sense

of
and
as
the
mind
frames
to
itself
abstract
ideas
of
qualities
or
modes
so
does
it
by
the
same
precision
or
mental
separation
attain
abstract
ideas
of
the
more
compounded
beings
which
include
several
coexistent
qualities
for
example
the
mind
having
observed
that
peter
james
and
john
resemble
each
other
in
certain
common
agreements
of
shape
and
other
qualities
leaves
out
of
the
complex
or
compounded
idea
it
has
of
peter
james
and
any
other
particular
man
that
which
is
peculiar
to
each
retaining
only
what
is
common
to
all
and
so
makes
an
abstract
idea
wherein
all
the
particulars
equally
partake
abstracting
entirely
from
and
cutting
off
all
those
circumstances
and
differences
which
might
determine
it
to
any
particular
existence
and
after
this
manner
it
is
said
we
come
by
the
abstract
idea
of
man
or
if
you
please
humanity
or
human
nature
wherein
it
is
true
there
is
included
colour
because
there
is
no
man
but
has
some
colour
but
then
it
can
be
neither
white
nor
black
nor
any
particular
colour
because
there
is
no
one
particular
colour
wherein
all
men
partake
so
likewise
there
is
included
stature
but
then
it
is
neither
tall
stature
nor
low
stature
nor
yet
middle
stature
but
something
abstracted
from
all
these
and
so
of
the
rest
moreover
their
being
a
great
variety
of
other
creatures
that
partake
in
some
parts
but
not
all
of
the
complex
idea
of
man
the
mind
leaving
out
those
parts
which
are
peculiar
to
men
and
retaining
those
only
which
are
common
to
all
the
living
creatures
frames
the
idea
of
animal
which
abstracts
not
only
from
all
particular
men
but
also
all
birds
beasts
fishes
and
insects
the
constituent
parts
of
the
abstract
idea
of
animal
are
body
life
sense
and
spontaneous
motion
by
body
is
meant
body
without
any
particular
shape
or
figure
there
being
no
one
shape
or
figure
common
to
all
animals
without
covering
either
of
hair
or
feathers
or
scales
nor
yet
naked
hair
feathers
scales
and
nakedness
being
the
distinguishing
properties
of
particular
animals
and
for
that
reason
left
out
of
the
abstract
idea
upon
the
same
account
the
spontaneous
motion
must
be
neither
walking
nor
flying
nor
creeping
it
is
nevertheless
a
motion

that
motion
is

have
this
wonderful
faculty
of
abstracting

ideas
they
best
can
tell
for
myself
i
find
indeed
i
have
a
faculty
of
imagining
or
representing
to
myself
the
ideas
of
those
particular
things
i
have
perceived
and
of
variously
compounding
and
dividing
them
i
can
imagine
a
man
with
two
heads
or

of
a
man
joined
to
the
body
of

horse
i
can
consider

the

each
by
itself
abstracted

from

rest
of

body
but
then
whatever
hand
or

i
imagine
it
must
have
some
particular

likewise
the
idea
of
man
that
i
frame
to
myself
must
be
either
of
a
white
or
a
black
or
a
tawny
a
straight
or
a
crooked
a
tall
or
a
low
or
a
man
i
can
not
by
any
effort
of
thought
conceive
the
abstract
idea
above
described
and
it
is
equally
impossible
for
me
to
form
the
abstract
idea
of
motion
distinct
from
the
body
moving
and
which
is
neither
swift
nor
slow
curvilinear
nor
rectilinear
and
the
like
may
be
said
of
all
other
abstract
general
ideas
whatsoever
to
be
plain
i
own
myself
able
to
abstract
in
one
sense
as
when
i
consider
some
particular
parts
or
qualities
separated
from
others
with
which
though
they
are
united
in
some
object
yet
it
is
possible
they
may
really
exist
without
them
but
i
deny
that
i
can
abstract
from
one
another
or
conceive
separately
those
qualities
which
it
is
impossible
should
exist
so
separated
or
that
i
can
frame
a
general
notion
by
abstracting
from
particulars
in
the
manner
aforesaid
which
last
are
the
two
proper
acceptations
of
abstraction
and
there
are
grounds
to
think
most
men
will
acknowledge
themselves
to
be
in
my
case
the
generality
of
men
which
are
simple
and
illiterate
never
pretend
to
abstract
notions
it
is
said
they
are
difficult
and
not
to
be
attained
without
pains
and
study
we
may
therefore
reasonably
conclude
that
if
such
there
be
they
are
confined
only
to
the
learned
i
proceed
to
examine
what
can
be
alleged
in
defence
of
the
doctrine
of
abstraction
and
try
if
i
can
discover
what
it
is
that
inclines
the
men
of
speculation
to
embrace
an
opinion
so
remote
from
common
sense
as
that
seems
to
be
there
has
been
a
late
deservedly
esteemed
philosopher
who
no
doubt
has
given
it
very
much
countenance
by
seeming
to
think
the
having
abstract
general
ideas
is
what
puts
the
widest
difference
in
point
of
understanding
betwixt
man
and
beast
the
having
of
general
ideas
saith
he
is
that
which
puts
a
perfect
distinction
betwixt
man
and
brutes
and
is
an
excellency
which
the
faculties
of
brutes
do
by
no
means
attain
unto
for
it
is
evident
we
observe
no
in
them
of
making
use
of
general
signs
for
universal
ideas
from
which
we
have
reason
to
imagine
that
they
have
not
the
faculty
of
abstracting
or
making
general
ideas
since
they
have
no
use
of
words
or
any
other
general
signs
and
a
little
after
therefore
i
think
we
may
suppose
that
it
is
in
this
that
the
species
of
brutes
are
discriminated
from
men
and
it
is
that
proper
difference
wherein
they
are
wholly
separated
and
which
at
last
widens
to
so
wide
a
distance
for
if
they
have
any
ideas
at
all
and
are
not
bare
machines
as
some
would
have
them
we
can
not
deny
them
to
have
some
reason
it
seems
as
evident
to
me
that
they
do
some
of
them
in
certain
instances
reason
as
that
they
have
sense
but
it
is
only
in
particular
ideas
just
as
they
receive
them
from
their
senses
they
are
the
best
of
them
tied
up
within
those
narrow
bounds
and
have
not
as
i
think
the
faculty
to
enlarge
them
by
any
kind
of
abstraction
essay
on
human
understanding
ii
xi
and
i
readily
agree
with
this
learned
author
that
the
faculties
of
brutes
can
by
no
means
attain
to
abstraction
but
then
if
this
be
made
the
distinguishing
property
of
that
sort
of
animals
i
fear
a
great
many
of
those
that
pass
for
men
must
be
reckoned
into
their
number
the
reason
that
is
here
assigned
why
we
have
no
grounds
to
think
brutes
have
abstract
general
ideas
is
that
we
observe
in
them
no
use
of
words
or
any
other
general
signs
which
is
built
on
this
supposition
that
the
making
use
of
words
implies
the
having
general
ideas
from
which
it
follows
that
men
who
use
language
are
able
to
abstract
or
generalize
their
ideas
that
this
is
the
sense
and
arguing
of
the
author
will
further
appear
by
his
answering
the
question
he
in
another
place
puts
since
all
things
that
exist
are
only
particulars
how
come
we
by
general
terms
his
answer
is
words
become
general
by
being
made
the
signs
of
general
ideas
essay
on
human
understanding
iv
iii
but
note
it
seems
that
a
word
becomes
general
by
being
made
the
sign
not
of
an
abstract
general
idea
but
of
several
particular
ideas
note
any
one
of
which
it
indifferently
suggests
to
the
mind
for
example
when
it
is
said
the
change
of
motion
is
proportional
to
the
impressed
force
or
that
whatever
has
extension
is
divisible
these
propositions
are
to
be
understood
of
motion
and
extension
in
general
and
nevertheless
it
will
not
follow
that
they
suggest
to
my
thoughts
an
idea
of
motion
without
a
body
moved
or
any
determinate
direction
and
velocity
or
that
i
must
conceive
an
abstract
general
idea
of
extension
which
is
neither
line
surface
nor
solid
neither
great
nor
small
black
white
nor
red
nor
of
any
other
determinate
colour
it
is
only
implied
that
whatever
particular
motion
i
consider
whether
it
be
swift
or
slow
perpendicular
horizontal
or
oblique
or
in
whatever
object
the
axiom
concerning
it
holds
equally
true
as
does
the
other
of
every
particular
extension
it
matters
not
whether
line
surface
or
solid
whether
of
this
or
that
magnitude
or
figure
note
to
this
i
can
not
assent
being
of
opinion
edit
of
note
of
the
same
sort
existence
of
general
ideas
by
observing
how
ideas
become
general
we
may
the
better
judge
how
words
are
made
so
and
here
it
is
to
be
noted
that
i
do
not
deny
absolutely
there
are
general
ideas
but
only
that
there
are
any
abstract
general
ideas
for
in
the
passages
we
have
quoted
wherein
there
is
mention
of
general
ideas
it
is
always
supposed
that
they
are
formed
by
abstraction
after
the
manner
set
forth
in
sections
and
now
if
we
will
annex
a
meaning
to
our
words
and
speak
only
of
what
we
can
conceive
i
believe
we
shall
acknowledge
that
an
idea
which
considered
in
itself
is
particular
becomes
general
by
being
made
to
represent
or
stand
for
all
other
particular
ideas
of
the
same
sort
to
make
this
plain
by
an
example
suppose
a
geometrician
is
demonstrating
the
method
of
cutting
a
line
in
two
equal
parts
he
draws
for
instance
a
black
line
of
an
inch
in
length
this
which
in
itself
is
a
particular
line
is
nevertheless
with
regard
to
its
signification
general
since
as
it
is
there
used
it
represents
all
particular
lines
whatsoever
so
that
what
is
demonstrated
of
it
is
demonstrated
of
all
lines
or
in
other
words
of
a
line
in
general
and
as
that
particular
line
becomes
general
by
being
made
a
sign
so
the
name
line
which
taken
absolutely
is
particular
by
being
a
sign
is
made
general
and
as
the
former
owes
its
generality
not
to
its
being
the
sign
of
an
abstract
or
general
line
but
of
all
particular
right
lines
that
may
possibly
exist
so
the
latter
must
be
thought
to
derive
its
generality
from
the
same
cause
namely
the
various
particular
lines
which
it
indifferently
denotes
note
note
i
look
upon
this
doctrine
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
valuable
discoveries
that
have
been
made
of
late
years
in

nature

uses

to
i
shall
add
one
more
passage
out
of
the
essay
on
human
understanding
iv
vii
which
is
as
follows
abstract
ideas
are
not
so
obvious
or
easy
to
children
or
the
yet
unexercised
mind
as
particular
ones
if
they
seem
so
to
grown
men
it
is
only
because
by
constant
and
familiar
use
they
are
made
so
for
when
we
nicely
reflect
upon
them
we
shall
find
that
general
ideas
are
fictions
and
contrivances
of
the
mind
that
carry
difficulty
with
them
and
do
not
so
easily
offer
themselves
as
we
are
apt
to
imagine
for
example
does
it
not
require
some
pains
and
skill
to
form
the
general
idea
of
a
triangle
which
is
yet
none
of
the
most
abstract
comprehensive
and
difficult
for
it
must
be
neither
oblique
nor
rectangle
neither
equilateral
equicrural
nor
scalenon
but
all
and
none
of
these
at
once
in
effect
it
is
something
imperfect
that
can
not
exist
an
idea
wherein
some
parts
of
several
different
and
inconsistent
ideas
are
put
together
it
is
true
the
mind
in
this
imperfect
state
has
need
of
such
ideas
and
makes
all
the
haste
to
them
it
can
for
the
conveniency
of
communication
and
enlargement
of
knowledge
to
both
which
it
is
naturally
very
much
inclined
but
yet
one
has
reason
to
suspect
such
ideas
are
marks
of
our
imperfection
at
least
this
is
enough
to
show
that
the
most
abstract
and
general
ideas
are
not
those
that
the
mind
is
first
and
most
easily
acquainted
with
nor
such
as
its
earliest
knowledge
is
conversant
about
if
any
man
has
the
faculty
of
framing
in
his
mind
such
an
idea
of
a
triangle
as
is
here
described
it
is
in
vain
to
pretend
to
dispute
him
out
of
it
nor
would
i
go
about
it
all
i
desire
is
that
the
reader
would
fully
and
certainly
inform
himself
whether
he
has
such
an
idea
or
no
and
this
methinks
can
be
no
hard
task
for
anyone
to
perform
what
more
easy
than
for
anyone
to
look
a
little
into
his
own
thoughts
and
there
try
whether
he
has
or
can
attain
to
have
an
idea
that
shall
correspond
with
the
description
that
is
here
given
of
the
general
idea
of
a
triangle
which
is
neither
oblique
nor
rectangle
equilateral
equicrural
nor
scalenon
but
all
and
none
of
these
at
once
but
they
are
not
necessary
for
much
is
here
said
of
the
difficulty
that
abstract
ideas
carry
with
them
and
the
pains
and
skill
requisite
to
the
forming
them
and
it
is
on
all
hands
agreed
that
there
is
need
of
great
toil
and
labour
of
the
mind
to
emancipate
our
thoughts
from
particular
objects
and
raise
them
to
those
sublime
speculations
that
are
conversant
about
abstract
ideas
from
all
which
the
natural
consequence
should
seem
to
be
that
so
difficult
a
thing
as
the
forming
abstract
ideas
was
not
necessary
for
communication
which
is
so
easy
and
familiar
to
all
sorts
of
men
but
we
are
told
if
they
seem
obvious
and
easy
to
grown
men
it
is
only
because
by
constant
and
familiar
use
they
are
made
so
now
i
would
fain
know
at
what
time
it
is
men
are
employed
in
surmounting
that
difficulty
and
furnishing
themselves
with
those
necessary
helps
for
discourse
it
can
not
be
when
they
are
grown
up
for
then
it
seems
they
are
not
conscious
of
any
such
painstaking
it
remains
therefore
to
be
the
business
of
their
childhood
and
surely
the
great
and
multiplied
labour
of
framing
abstract
notions
will
be
found
a
hard
task
for
that
tender
age
is
it
not
a
hard
thing
to
imagine
that
a
couple
of
children
can
not
prate
together
of
their
and
rattles
and
the
rest
of
their
little
trinkets
till
they
have
first
tacked
together
numberless
inconsistencies
and
so
framed
in
their
minds
abstract
general
ideas
and
annexed
them
to
every
common
name
they
make
use
of
nor
for
the
enlargement
of
nor
do
i
think
them
a
whit
more
needful
for
the
enlargement
of
knowledge
than
for
communication
it
is
i
know
a
point
much
insisted
on
that
all
knowledge
and
demonstration
are
about
universal
notions
to
which
i
fully
agree
but
then
it
doth
not
appear
to
me
that
those
notions
are
formed
by
abstraction
in
the
manner
premised
universality
so
far
as
i
can
comprehend
not
consisting
in
the
absolute
positive
nature
or
conception
of
anything
but
in
the
relation
it
bears
to
the
particulars
signified
or
represented
by
it
by
virtue
whereof
it
is
that
things
names
or
notions
being
in
their
own
nature
particular
are
rendered
universal
thus
when
i
demonstrate
any
proposition
concerning
triangles
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
i
have
in
view
the
universal
idea
of
a
triangle
which
ought
not
to
be
understood
as
if
i
could
frame
an
idea
of
a
triangle
which
was
neither
equilateral
nor
scalenon
nor
equicrural
but
only
that
the
particular
triangle
i
consider
whether
of
this
or
that
sort
it
matters
not
doth
equally
stand
for
and
represent
all
rectilinear
triangles
whatsoever
and
is
in
that
sense
universal
all
which
seems
very
plain
and
not
to
include
any
difficulty
in
it
but
here
it
will
be
demanded
how
we
can
know
any
proposition
to
be
true
of
all
particular
triangles
except
we
have
first
seen
it
demonstrated
of
the
abstract
idea
of
a
triangle
which
equally
agrees
to
all
for
because
a
property
may
be
demonstrated
to
agree
to
some
one
particular
triangle
it
will
not
thence
follow
that
it
equally
belongs
to
any
other
triangle
which
in
all
respects
is
not
the
same
with
it
for
example
having
demonstrated
that
the
three
angles
of
an
isosceles
rectangular
triangle
are
equal
to
two
right
ones
i
can
not
therefore
conclude
this
affection
agrees
to
all
other
triangles
which
have
neither
a
right
angle
nor
two
equal
sides
it
seems
therefore
that
to
be
certain
this
proposition
is
universally
true
we
must
either
make
a
particular
demonstration
for
every
particular
triangle
which
is
impossible
or
once
for
all
demonstrate
it
of
the
abstract
idea
of
a
triangle
in
which
all
the
particulars
do
indifferently
partake
and
by
which
they
are
all
equally
represented
to
which
i
answer
that
though
the
idea
i
have
in
view
whilst
i
make
the
demonstration
be
for
instance
that
of
an
isosceles
rectangular
triangle
whose
sides
are
of
a
determinate
length
i
may
nevertheless
be
certain
it
extends
to
all
other
rectilinear
triangles
of
what
sort
or
bigness
soever
and
that
because
neither
the
right
angle
nor
the
equality
nor
determinate
length
of
the
sides
are
at
all
concerned
in
the
demonstration
it
is
true
the
diagram
i
have
in
view
includes
all
these
particulars
but
then
there
is
not
the
least
mention
made
of
them
in
the
proof
of
the
proposition
it
is
not
said
the
three
angles
are
equal
to
two
right
ones
because
one
of
them
is
a
right
angle
or
because
the
sides
comprehending
it
are
of
the
same
length
which
sufficiently
shows
that
the
right
angle
might
have
been
oblique
and
the
sides
unequal
and
for
all
that
the
demonstration
have
held
good
and
for
this
reason
it
is
that
i
conclude
that
to
be
true
of
any
obliquangular
or
scalenon
which
i
had
demonstrated
of
a
particular
right
angled
equicrural
triangle
and
not
because
i
demonstrated
the
proposition
of
the
abstract
idea
of
a
triangle
and
here
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
a
man
may
consider
a
figure
merely
as
triangular
without
attending
to
the
particular
qualities
of
the
angles
or
relations
of
the
sides
so
far
he
may
abstract
but
this
will
never
prove
that
he
can
frame
an
abstract
general
inconsistent
idea
of
a
triangle
in
like
manner
we
may
consider
peter
so
far
forth
as
man
or
so
far
forth
as
animal
without
framing
the
abstract
idea
either
of
man
or
of
animal
inasmuch
as
all
that
is
perceived
is
not
considered
advantage
of
investigating
the
doctrine
of
abstract
general
it
were
an
endless
as
well
as
an
useless
thing
to
trace
the
schoolmen
those
great
masters
of
abstraction
through
all
the
manifold
inextricable
labyrinths
of
error
and
dispute
which
their
doctrine
of
abstract
natures
and
notions
seems
to
have
led
them
into
what
bickerings
and
controversies
and
what
a
learned
dust
have
been
raised
about
those
matters
and
what
mighty
advantage
has
been
from
thence
derived
to
mankind
are
things
at
this
day
too
clearly
known
to
need
being
insisted
on
and
it
had
been
well
if
the
ill
effects
of
that
doctrine
were
confined
to
those
only
who
make
the
most
avowed
profession
of
it
when
men
consider
the
great
pains
industry
and
parts
that
have
for
so
many
ages
been
laid
out
on
the
cultivation
and
advancement
of
the
sciences
and
that
notwithstanding
all
this
the
far
greater
part
of
them
remains
full
of
darkness
and
uncertainty
and
disputes
that
are
like
never
to
have
an
end
and
even
those
that
are
thought
to
be
supported
by
the
most
clear
and
cogent
demonstrations
contain
in
them
paradoxes
which
are
perfectly
irreconcilable
to
the
understandings
of
men
and
that
taking
all
together
a
very
small
portion
of
them
does
supply
any
real
benefit
to
mankind
otherwise
than
by
being
an
innocent
diversion
and
amusement
i
say
the
consideration
of
all
this
is
apt
to
throw
them
into
a
despondency
and
perfect
contempt
of
all
study
but
this
may
perhaps
cease
upon
a
view
of
the
false
principles
that
have
obtained
in
the
world
amongst
all
which
there
is
none
methinks
has
a
more
wide
and
extended
sway
over
the
thoughts
of
speculative
men
than
note
this
of
abstract
general
ideas
note
that
we
have
been
endeavouring
to
overthrow
edit
i
come
now
to
consider
the
source
of
this
prevailing
notion
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
language
and
surely
nothing
of
less
extent
than
reason
itself
could
have
been
the
source
of
an
opinion
so
universally
received
the
truth
of
this
appears
as
from
other
reasons
so
also
from
the
plain
confession
of
the
ablest
patrons
of
abstract
ideas
who
acknowledge
that
they
are
made
in
order
to
naming
from
which
it
is
a
clear
consequence
that
if
there
had
been
no
such
things
as
speech
or
universal
signs
there
never
had
been
any
thought
of
abstraction
see
iii
vi
and
elsewhere
of
the
essay
on
human
understanding
let
us
examine
the
manner
wherein
words
have
contributed
to
the
origin
of
that
first
vide
sect
xix
then
it
is
thought
that
every
name
has
or
ought
to
have
one
only
precise
and
settled
signification
which
inclines
men
to
think
there
are
certain
abstract
determinate
ideas
that
constitute
the
true
and
only
immediate
signification
of
each
general
name
and
that
it
is
by
the
mediation
of
these
abstract
ideas
that
a
general
name
comes
to
signify
any
particular
thing
whereas
in
truth
there
is
no
such
thing
as
one
precise
and
definite
signification
annexed
to
any
general
name
they
all
signifying
indifferently
a
great
number
of
particular
ideas
all
which
doth
evidently
follow
from
what
has
been
already
said
and
will
clearly
appear
to
anyone
by
a
little
reflexion
to
this
it
will
be
objected
that
every
name
that
has
a
definition
is
thereby
restrained
to
one
certain
signification
for
example
a
triangle
is
defined
to
be
a
plain
surface
comprehended
by
three
right
lines
by
which
that
name
is
limited
to
denote
one
certain
idea
and
no
other
to
which
i
answer
that
in
the
definition
it
is
not
said
whether
the
surface
be
great
or
small
black
or
white
nor
whether
the
sides
are
long
or
short
equal
or
unequal
nor
with
what
angles
they
are
inclined
to
each
other
in
all
which
there
may
be
great
variety
and
consequently
there
is
no
one
settled
idea
which
limits
the
signification
of
the
word
triangle
it
is
one
thing
for
to
keep
a
name
constantly
to
the
same
definition
and
another
to
make
it
stand
everywhere
for
the
same
idea
the
one
is
necessary
the
other
useless
and
impracticable
secondly
but
to
give
a
farther
account
how
words
came
to
produce
the
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas
it
must
be
observed
that
it
is
a
received
opinion
that
language
has
no
other
end
but
the
communicating
our
ideas
and
that
every
significant
name
stands
for
an
idea
this
being
so
and
it
being
withal
certain
that
names
which
yet
are
not
thought
altogether
insignificant
do
not
always
mark
out
particular
conceivable
ideas
it
is
straightway
concluded
that
they
stand
for
abstract
notions
that
there
are
many
names
in
use
amongst
speculative
men
which
do
not
always
suggest
to
others
determinate
particular
ideas
or
in
truth
anything
at
all
is
what
nobody
will
deny
and
a
little
attention
will
discover
that
it
is
not
necessary
even
in
the
strictest
reasonings
significant
names
which
stand
for
ideas
should
every
time
they
are
used
excite
in
the
understanding
the
ideas
they
are
made
to
stand
for
in
reading
and
discoursing
names
being
for
the
most
part
used
as
letters
are
in
algebra
in
which
though
a
particular
quantity
be
marked
by
each
letter
yet
to
proceed
right
it
is
not
requisite
that
in
every
step
each
letter
suggest
to
your
thoughts
that
particular
quantity
it
was
appointed
to
stand
note
note
language
has
become
the
source
or
origin
of
abstract
general
ideas
on
account
of
a
twofold
that
every
word
has
only
one
signification
that
the
only
end
of
language
is
the
communication
of
our
ideas
ed
some
of
the
ends
of
besides
the
communicating
of
ideas
marked
by
words
is
not
the
chief
and
only
end
of
language
as
is
commonly
supposed
there
are
other
ends
as
the
raising
of
some
passion
the
exciting
to
or
deterring
from
an
action
the
putting
the
mind
in
some
particular
disposition
to
which
the
former
is
in
many
cases
barely
subservient
and
sometimes
entirely
omitted
when
these
can
be
obtained
without
it
as
i
think
does
not
unfrequently
happen
in
the
familiar
use
of
language
i
entreat
the
reader
to
reflect
with
himself
and
see
if
it
doth
not
often
happen
either
in
hearing
or
reading
a
discourse
that
the
passions
of
fear
love
hatred
admiration
disdain
and
the
like
arise
immediately
in
his
mind
upon
the
perception
of
certain
words
without
any
ideas
coming
between
at
first
indeed
the
words
might
have
occasioned
ideas
that
were
fitting
to
produce
those
emotions
but
if
i
mistake
not
it
will
be
found
that
when
language
is
once
grown
familiar
the
hearing
of
the
sounds
or
sight
of
the
characters
is
oft
immediately
attended
with
those
passions
which
at
first
were
wont
to
be
produced
by
the
intervention
of
ideas
that
are
now
quite
omitted
may
we
not
for
example
be
affected
with
the
promise
of
a
good
thing
though
we
have
not
an
idea
of
what
it
is
or
is
not
the
being
threatened
with
danger
sufficient
to
excite
a
dread
though
we
think
not
of
any
particular
evil
likely
to
befal
us
nor
yet
frame
to
ourselves
an
idea
of
danger
in
abstract
if
any
one
shall
join
ever
so
little
reflexion
of
his
own
to
what
has
been
said
i
believe
that
it
will
evidently
appear
to
him
that
general
names
are
often
used
in
the
propriety
of
language
without
the
speaker
designing
them
for
marks
of
ideas
in
his
own
which
he
would
have
them
raise
in
the
mind
of
the
hearer
even
proper
names
themselves
do
not
seem
always
spoken
with
a
design
to
bring
into
our
view
the
ideas
of
those
individuals
that
are
supposed
to
be
marked
by
them
for
example
when
a
schoolman
tells
me
aristotle
has
said
it
all
i
conceive
he
means
by
it
is
to
dispose
me
to
embrace
his
opinion
with
the
deference
and
submission
which
custom
has
annexed
to
that
name
and
this
effect
is
often
so
instantly
produced
in
the
minds
of
those
who
are
accustomed
to
resign
their
judgment
to
authority
of
that
philosopher
as
it
is
impossible
any
idea
either
of
his
person
writings
or
reputation
should
go
before
innumerable
examples
of
this
kind
may
be
given
but
why
should
i
insist
on
those
things
which
every
one
experience
will
i
doubt
not
plentifully
suggest
unto
him
note
so
close
and
immediate
a
connection
may
custom
establish
betwixt
the
very
word
aristotle
and
the
motions
of
assent
and
reverence
in
the
minds
of
some
men
edit
caution
in
the
use
of
language
we
have
i
think
shown
the
impossibility
of
abstract
ideas
we
have
considered
what
has
been
said
for
them
by
their
ablest
patrons
and
endeavored
to
show
they
are
of
no
use
for
those
ends
to
which
they
are
thought
necessary
and
lastly
we
have
traced
them
to
the
source
from
whence
they
flow
which
appears
evidently
to
be
it
can
not
be
denied
that
words
are
of
excellent
use
in
that
by
their
means
all
that
stock
of
knowledge
which
has
been
purchased
by
the
joint
labours
of
inquisitive
men
in
all
ages
and
nations
may
be
drawn
into
the
view
and
made
the
possession
of
one
single
person
but
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
owned
that
most
parts
of
knowledge
have
been
strangely
perplexed
and
darkened
by
the
abuse
of
words
and
general
ways
of
speech
wherein
they
are
delivered
note
since
therefore
words
are
so
apt
to
impose
on
the
understanding
note
whatever
ideas
i
consider
i
shall
endeavour
to
take
them
bare
and
naked
into
my
view
keeping
out
of
my
thoughts
so
far
as
i
am
able
those
names
which
long
and
constant
use
has
so
strictly
united
with
them
from
which
i
may
expect
to
derive
the
following
advantages
note
that
it
may
almost
be
made
a
question
whether
language
has
contributed
more
to
the
hindrance
or
advancement
of
the
sciences
edit
note
i
am
resolved
in
my
inquiries
to
make
as
little
use
of
them
as
possibly
i
can
edit
first
i
shall
be
sure
to
get
clear
of
all
controversies
purely
verbal
the
springing
up
of
which
weeds
in
almost
all
the
sciences
has
been
a
main
hindrance
to
the
growth
of
true
and
sound
knowledge
secondly
this
seems
to
be
a
sure
way
to
extricate
myself
out
of
that
fine
and
subtle
net
of
abstract
ideas
which
has
so
miserably
perplexed
and
entangled
the
minds
of
men
and
that
with
this
peculiar
circumstance
that
by
how
much
the
finer
and
more
curious
was
the
wit
of
any
man
by
so
much
the
deeper
was
he
likely
to
be
ensnared
and
faster
held
therein
thirdly
so
long
as
i
confine
my
thoughts
to
my
own
ideas
divested
of
words
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
easily
be
mistaken
the
objects
i
consider
i
clearly
and
adequately
know
i
can
not
be
deceived
in
thinking
i
have
an
idea
which
i
have
not
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
imagine
that
any
of
my
own
ideas
are
alike
or
unlike
that
are
not
truly
so
to
discern
the
agreements
or
disagreements
there
are
between
my
ideas
to
see
what
ideas
are
included
in
any
compound
idea
and
what
not
there
is
nothing
more
requisite
than
an
attentive
perception
of
what
passes
in
my
own
understanding
but
the
attainment
of
all
these
advantages
doth
presuppose
an
entire
deliverance
from
the
deception
of
words
which
i
dare
hardly
promise
myself
so
difficult
a
thing
it
is
to
dissolve
an
union
so
early
begun
and
confirmed
by
so
long
a
habit
as
that
betwixt
words
and
ideas
which
difficulty
seems
to
have
been
very
much
increased
by
the
doctrine
of
abstraction
for
so
long
as
men
thought
abstract
ideas
were
annexed
to
their
words
it
doth
not
seem
strange
that
they
should
use
words
for
ideas
it
being
found
an
impracticable
thing
to
lay
aside
the
word
and
retain
the
abstract
idea
in
the
mind
which
in
itself
was
perfectly
inconceivable
this
seems
to
me
the
principal
cause
why
those
men
who
have
so
emphatically
recommended
to
others
the
laying
aside
all
use
of
words
in
their
meditations
and
contemplating
their
bare
ideas
have
yet
failed
to
perform
it
themselves
of
late
many
have
been
very
sensible
of
the
absurd
opinions
and
insignificant
disputes
which
grow
out
of
the
abuse
of
words
and
in
order
to
remedy
these
evils
they
advise
well
that
we
attend
to
the
ideas
signified
and
draw
off
our
attention
from
the
words
which
signify
them
but
how
good
soever
this
advice
may
be
they
have
given
others
it
is
plain
they
could
not
have
a
due
regard
to
it
themselves
so
long
as
they
thought
the
only
immediate
use
of
words
was
to
signify
ideas
and
that
the
immediate
signification
of
every
general
name
was
a
determinate
abstract
idea
but
these
being
known
to
be
mistakes
a
man
may
with
greater
ease
prevent
his
being
imposed
on
by
words
he
that
knows
he
has
no
other
than
particular
ideas
will
not
puzzle
himself
in
vain
to
find
out
and
conceive
the
abstract
idea
annexed
to
any
name
and
he
that
knows
names
do
not
always
stand
for
ideas
will
spare
himself
the
labour
of
looking
for
ideas
where
there
are
none
to
be
had
it
were
therefore
to
be
wished
that
everyone
would
use
his
utmost
endeavours
to
obtain
a
clear
view
of
the
ideas
he
would
consider
separating
from
them
all
that
dress
and
incumbrance
of
words
which
so
much
contribute
to
blind
the
judgment
and
divide
the
attention
in
vain
do
we
extend
our
view
into
the
heavens
and
pry
into
the
entrails
of
the
earth
in
vain
do
we
consult
the
writings
of
learned
men
and
trace
the
dark
footsteps
of
antiquity
we
need
only
draw
the
curtain
of
words
to
hold
the
fairest
tree
of
knowledge
whose
fruit
is
excellent
and
within
the
reach
of
our
hand
unless
we
take
care
to
clear
the
first
principles
of
knowledge
from
the
embarras
and
delusion
of
words
we
may
make
infinite
reasonings
upon
them
to
no
purpose
we
may
draw
consequences
from
consequences
and
be
never
the
wiser
the
farther
we
go
we
shall
only
lose
ourselves
the
more
irrecoverably
and
be
the
deeper
entangled
in
difficulties
and
mistakes
whoever
therefore
designs
to
read
the
following
sheets
i
entreat
him
to
make
my
words
the
occasion
of
his
own
thinking
and
endeavour
to
attain
the
same
train
of
thoughts
in
reading
that
i
had
in
writing
them
by
this
means
it
will
be
easy
for
him
to
discover
the
truth
or
falsity
of
what
i
say
he
will
be
out
of
all
danger
of
being
deceived
by
my
words
and
i
do
not
see
how
he
can
be
led
into
an
error
by
considering
his
own
naked
undisguised
ideas
of
the
principles
of
human
knowledge
objects
of
human
it
is
evident
to
any
one
who
takes
a
survey
of
the
objects
of
human
knowledge
that
they
are
either
ideas
actually
imprinted
on
the
senses
or
else
such
as
are
perceived
by
attending
to
the
passions
and
operations
of
the
mind
or
lastly
ideas
formed
by
help
of
memory
and
imagination
either
compounding
dividing
or
barely
representing
those
originally
perceived
in
the
aforesaid
ways
by
sight
i
have
the
ideas
of
light
and
colours
with
their
several
degrees
and
variations
by
touch
i
perceive
hard
and
soft
heat
and
cold
motion
and
resistance
and
of
all
these
more
and
less
either
as
to
quantity
or
degree
smelling
furnishes
me
with
odours
the
palate
with
tastes
and
hearing
conveys
sounds
to
the
mind
in
all
their
variety
of
tone
and
composition
and
as
several
of
these
are
observed
to
accompany
each
other
they
come
to
be
marked
by
one
name
and
so
to
be
reputed
as
one
thing
thus
for
example
a
certain
colour
taste
smell
figure
and
consistence
having
been
observed
to
go
together
are
accounted
one
distinct
thing
signified
by
the
name
apple
other
collections
of
ideas
constitute
a
stone
a
tree
a
book
and
the
like
sensible
things
which
as
they
are
pleasing
or
disagreeable
excite
the
passions
of
love
hatred
joy
grief
and
so
forth
mind
spirit
but
besides
all
that
endless
variety
of
ideas
or
objects
of
knowledge
there
is
likewise
something
which
knows
or
perceives
them
and
exercises
divers
operations
as
willing
imagining
remembering
about
them
this
perceiving
active
being
is
what
i
call
mind
spirit
soul
or
myself
by
which
words
i
do
not
denote
any
one
of
my
ideas
but
a
thing
entirely
distinct
from
them
wherein
they
exist
or
which
is
the
same
thing
whereby
they
are
perceived
for
the
existence
of
an
idea
consists
in
being
perceived
how
far
the
assent
of
the
vulgar
that
neither
our
thoughts
nor
passions
nor
ideas
formed
by
the
imagination
exist
without
the
mind
is
what
everybody
will
allow
and
it
seems
no
less
evident
that
the
various
sensations
or
ideas
imprinted
on
the
sense
however
blended
or
combined
together
that
is
whatever
objects
they
compose
can
not
exist
otherwise
than
in
a
mind
perceiving
them
i
think
an
intuitive
knowledge
may
be
obtained
of
this
by
any
one
that
shall
attend
to
what
is
meant
by
the
term
exist
when
applied
to
sensible
things
the
table
i
write
on
i
say
exists
that
is
i
see
and
feel
it
and
if
i
were
out
of
my
study
i
should
say
it
existed
meaning
thereby
that
if
i
was
in
my
study
i
might
perceive
it
or
that
some
other
spirit
actually
does
perceive
note
there
was
an
odour
that
is
it
was
smelt
there
was
a
sound
that
is
it
was
heard
a
colour
or
figure
and
it
was
perceived
by
sight
or
touch
this
is
all
that
i
can
understand
by
these
and
the
like
expressions
for
as
to
what
is
said
of
the
absolute
existence
of
unthinking
things
without
any
relation
to
their
being
perceived
that
seems
perfectly
unintelligible
their
esse
is
percipi
nor
is
it
possible
they
should
have
any
existence
out
of
the
minds
or
thinking
things
which
perceive
them
note
first
argument
in
support
of
the
author
theory
the
vulgar
opinion
involves
a
it
is
indeed
an
opinion
strangely
prevailing
amongst
men
that
houses
mountains
rivers
and
in
a
word
all
sensible
objects
have
an
existence
natural
or
real
distinct
from
their
being
perceived
by
the
understanding
but
with
how
great
an
assurance
and
acquiescence
soever
this
principle
may
be
entertained
in
the
world
yet
whoever
shall
find
in
his
heart
to
call
it
in
question
may
if
i
mistake
not
perceive
it
to
involve
a
manifest
contradiction
for
what
are
the
objects
but
the
things
we
perceive
by
sense
and
what
do
we
perceive
besides
our
own
ideas
or
sensations
and
is
it
not
plainly
repugnant
that
any
one
of
these
or
any
combination
of
them
should
exist
unperceived
cause
of
this
prevalent
if
we
thoroughly
examine
this
tenet
it
will
perhaps
be
found
at
bottom
to
depend
on
the
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas
for
can
there
be
a
nicer
strain
of
abstraction
than
to
distinguish
the
existence
of
sensible
objects
from
their
being
perceived
so
as
to
conceive
them
existing
unperceived
light
and
colours
heat
and
cold
extension
and
figures
in
a
word
the
things
we
see
and
feel
what
are
they
but
so
many
sensations
notions
ideas
or
impressions
on
the
sense
and
is
it
possible
to
separate
even
in
thought
any
of
these
from
perception
for
my
part
i
might
as
easily
divide
a
thing
from
itself
i
may
indeed
divide
in
my
thoughts
or
conceive
apart
from
each
other
those
things
which
perhaps
i
never
perceived
by
sense
so
divided
thus
i
imagine
the
trunk
of
a
human
body
without
the
limbs
or
conceive
the
smell
of
a
rose
without
thinking
on
the
rose
itself
so
far
i
will
not
deny
i
can
abstract
if
that
may
properly
be
called
abstraction
which
extends
only
to
the
conceiving
separately
such
objects
as
it
is
possible
may
really
exist
or
be
actually
perceived
asunder
but
my
conceiving
or
imagining
power
does
not
extend
beyond
the
possibility
of
real
existence
or
perception
hence
as
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
see
or
feel
anything
without
an
actual
sensation
of
that
thing
so
is
it
impossible
for
me
to
conceive
in
my
thoughts
any
sensible
thing
or
object
distinct
from
the
sensation
or
perception
of
note
note
in
truth
the
object
and
the
sensation
are
the
same
thing
and
can
not
therefore
be
abstracted
from
each
other
edit
some
truths
there
are
so
near
and
obvious
to
the
mind
that
a
man
need
only
open
his
eyes
to
see
them
such
i
take
this
important
one
to
be
that
all
the
choir
of
heaven
and
furniture
of
the
earth
in
a
word
all
those
bodies
which
compose
the
mighty
frame
of
the
world
have
not
any
subsistence
without
a
mind
that
their
being
esse
is
to
be
perceived
or
known
that
consequently
so
long
as
they
are
not
actually
perceived
by
me
or
do
not
exist
in
my
mind
or
that
of
any
other
created
spirit
they
must
either
have
no
existence
at
all
or
else
subsist
in
the
mind
of
some
eternal
spirit
it
being
perfectly
unintelligible
and
involving
all
the
absurdity
of
abstraction
to
attribute
to
any
single
part
of
them
an
existence
independent
of
a
spirit
to
be
convinced
of
which
the
reader
need
only
reflect
and
try
to
separate
in
his
own
thoughts
the
being
of
a
sensible
thing
from
its
being
perceived
note
to
make
this
appear
with
all
the
light
and
evidence
of
an
axiom
it
seems
sufficient
if
i
can
but
awaken
the
reflection
of
the
reader
that
he
may
take
an
impartial
view
of
his
own
meaning
and
in
turn
his
thoughts
upon
the
subject
itself
free
and
disengaged
from
all
embarrass
of
words
and
prepossession
in
favour
of
received
mistakes
edit
second
note
from
what
has
been
said
it
follows
there
is
not
any
other
substance
than
spirit
or
that
which
perceives
but
for
the
fuller
proof
of
this
point
let
it
be
considered
the
sensible
qualities
are
colour
figure
motion
smell
taste
the
ideas
perceived
by
sense
now
for
an
idea
to
exist
in
an
unperceiving
thing
is
a
manifest
contradiction
for
to
have
an
idea
is
all
one
as
to
perceive
that
therefore
wherein
colour
figure
and
the
like
qualities
exist
must
perceive
them
hence
it
is
clear
there
can
be
no
unthinking
substance
or
substratum
of
those
ideas
note
vide
sect
iii
and
xxv
but
say
you
though
the
ideas
themselves
do
not
exist
without
the
mind
yet
there
may
be
things
like
them
whereof
they
are
copies
or
resemblances
which
things
exist
without
the
mind
in
an
unthinking
substance
i
answer
an
idea
can
be
like
nothing
but
an
idea
a
colour
or
figure
can
be
like
nothing
but
another
colour
or
figure
if
we
look
but
never
so
little
into
our
thoughts
we
shall
find
it
impossible
for
us
to
conceive
a
likeness
except
only
between
our
ideas
again
i
ask
whether
those
supposed
originals
or
external
things
of
which
our
ideas
are
the
pictures
or
representations
be
themselves
perceivable
or
no
if
they
are
then
they
are
ideas
and
we
have
gained
our
point
but
if
you
say
they
are
not
i
appeal
to
any
one
whether
it
be
sense
to
assert
a
colour
is
like
something
which
is
invisible
hard
or
soft
like
something
which
is
intangible
and
so
of
the
rest
the
philosophical
notion
of
matter
involves
a
some
there
are
who
make
a
distinction
betwixt
primary
and
secondary
qualities
by
the
former
they
mean
extension
figure
motion
rest
solidity
or
impenetrability
and
number
by
the
latter
they
denote
all
other
sensible
qualities
as
colours
sounds
tastes
and
so
forth
the
ideas
we
have
of
these
they
acknowledge
not
to
be
the
resemblances
of
anything
existing
without
the
mind
or
unperceived
but
they
will
have
our
ideas
of
the
primary
qualities
to
be
patterns
or
images
of
things
which
exist
without
the
mind
in
an
unthinking
substance
which
they
call
matter
by
matter
therefore
we
are
to
understand
an
inert
senseless
substance
in
which
extension
figure
and
motion
do
actually
subsist
but
it
is
evident
from
what
we
have
already
shown
that
extension
figure
and
motion
are
only
ideas
existing
in
the
mind
and
that
an
idea
can
be
like
nothing
but
another
idea
and
that
consequently
neither
they
nor
their
archetypes
can
exist
in
an
unperceiving
substance
hence
it
is
plain
that
the
very
notion
of
what
is
called
matter
or
corporeal
substance
involves
a
contradiction
in
note
note
insomuch
that
i
should
not
think
it
necessary
to
spend
more
time
in
exposing
its
absurdity
but
because
the
tenet
of
the
existence
of
matter
seems
to
have
taken
so
deep
a
root
in
the
minds
of
philosophers
and
draws
after
it
so
many
ill
consequences
i
choose
rather
to
be
thought
prolix
and
tedious
than
omit
anything
that
might
conduce
to
the
full
discovery
and
extirpation
of
the
prejudice
edit
argumentum
ad
they
who
assert
that
figure
motion
and
the
rest
of
the
primary
or
original
qualities
do
exist
without
the
mind
in
unthinking
substances
do
at
the
same
time
acknowledge
that
colours
sounds
heat
cold
and
suchlike
secondary
qualities
do
not
which
they
tell
us
are
sensations
existing
in
the
mind
alone
that
depend
on
and
are
occasioned
by
the
different
size
texture
and
motion
of
the
minute
particles
of
matter
this
they
take
for
an
undoubted
truth
which
they
can
demonstrate
beyond
all
exception
now
if
it
be
certain
that
those
original
qualities
are
inseparably
united
with
the
other
sensible
qualities
and
not
even
in
thought
capable
of
being
abstracted
from
them
it
plainly
follows
that
they
exist
only
in
the
mind
but
i
desire
any
one
to
reflect
and
try
whether
he
can
by
any
abstraction
of
thought
conceive
the
extension
and
motion
of
a
body
without
all
other
sensible
qualities
for
my
own
part
i
see
evidently
that
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
frame
an
idea
of
a
body
extended
and
moving
but
i
must
withal
give
it
some
colour
or
other
sensible
quality
which
is
acknowledged
to
exist
only
in
the
mind
in
short
extension
figure
and
motion
abstracted
from
all
other
qualities
are
inconceivable
where
therefore
the
other
sensible
qualities
are
there
must
these
be
also
to
wit
in
the
mind
and
nowhere
else
a
second
argument
ad
again
great
and
small
swift
and
slow
are
allowed
to
exist
nowhere
without
the
mind
being
entirely
relative
and
changing
as
the
frame
or
position
of
the
organs
of
sense
varies
the
extension
therefore
which
exists
without
the
mind
is
neither
great
nor
small
the
motion
neither
swift
nor
slow
that
is
they
are
nothing
at
all
but
say
you
they
are
extension
in
general
and
motion
in
general
thus
we
see
how
much
the
tenet
of
extended
movable
substances
existing
without
the
mind
depends
on
the
strange
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas
and
here
i
can
not
but
remark
how
nearly
the
vague
and
indeterminate
description
of
matter
or
corporeal
substance
which
the
modern
philosophers
are
run
into
by
their
own
principles
resembles
that
antiquated
and
so
much
ridiculed
notion
of
materia
prima
to
be
met
with
in
aristotle
and
his
followers
without
extension
solidity
can
not
be
conceived
since
therefore
it
has
been
shown
that
extension
exists
not
in
an
unthinking
substance
the
same
must
also
be
true
of
solidity
that
number
is
entirely
the
creature
of
the
mind
even
though
the
other
qualities
be
allowed
to
exist
without
will
be
evident
to
whoever
considers
that
the
same
thing
bears
a
different
denomination
of
number
as
the
mind
views
it
with
different
respects
thus
the
same
extension
is
one
or
three
or
according
as
the
mind
considers
it
with
reference
to
a
yard
a
foot
or
an
inch
number
is
so
visibly
relative
and
dependent
on
men
understanding
that
it
is
strange
to
think
how
any
one
should
give
it
an
absolute
existence
without
the
mind
we
say
one
book
one
page
one
line
etc
all
these
are
equally
units
though
some
contain
several
of
the
others
and
in
each
instance
it
is
plain
the
unit
relates
to
some
particular
combination
of
ideas
arbitrarily
put
together
by
the
mind
unity
i
know
some
will
have
to
be
a
simple
or
uncompounded
idea
accompanying
all
other
ideas
into
the
mind
that
i
have
any
such
idea
answering
the
word
unity
i
do
not
find
and
if
i
had
methinks
i
could
not
miss
finding
it
on
the
contrary
it
should
be
the
most
familiar
to
my
understanding
since
it
is
said
to
accompany
all
other
ideas
and
to
be
perceived
by
all
the
ways
of
sensation
and
reflexion
to
say
no
more
it
is
an
abstract
idea
a
third
argument
ad
i
shall
farther
add
that
after
the
same
manner
as
modern
philosophers
prove
certain
sensible
qualities
to
have
no
existence
in
matter
or
without
the
mind
the
same
thing
may
be
likewise
proved
of
all
other
sensible
qualities
whatsoever
thus
for
instance
it
is
said
that
heat
and
cold
are
affections
only
of
the
mind
and
not
at
all
patterns
of
real
beings
existing
in
the
corporeal
substances
which
excite
them
for
that
the
same
body
which
appears
cold
to
one
hand
seems
warm
to
another
now
why
may
we
not
as
well
argue
that
figure
and
extension
are
not
patterns
or
resemblances
of
qualities
existing
in
matter
because
to
the
same
eye
at
different
stations
or
eyes
of
a
different
texture
at
the
same
station
they
appear
various
and
can
not
therefore
be
the
images
of
anything
settled
and
determinate
without
the
mind
again
it
is
proved
that
sweetness
is
not
really
in
the
sapid
thing
because
the
thing
remaining
unaltered
the
sweetness
is
changed
into
bitter
as
in
case
of
a
fever
or
otherwise
vitiated
palate
is
it
not
as
reasonable
to
say
that
motion
is
not
without
the
mind
since
if
the
succession
of
ideas
in
the
mind
become
swifter
the
motion
it
is
acknowledged
shall
appear
slower
without
any
alteration
in
any
external
object
not
conclusive
as
to
in
short
let
any
one
consider
those
arguments
which
are
thought
manifestly
to
prove
that
colours
and
taste
exist
only
in
the
mind
and
he
shall
find
they
may
with
equal
force
be
brought
to
prove
the
same
thing
of
extension
figure
and
motion
though
it
must
be
confessed
this
method
of
arguing
does
not
so
much
prove
that
there
is
no
extension
or
colour
in
an
outward
object
as
that
we
do
not
know
by
sense
which
is
the
true
extension
or
colour
of
the
object
but
the
arguments
foregoing
plainly
show
it
to
be
impossible
that
any
colour
or
extension
at
all
or
other
sensible
quality
whatsoever
should
exist
in
an
unthinking
subject
without
the
mind
or
in
truth
that
there
should
be
any
such
thing
as
an
outward
object
but
let
us
examine
a
little
the
received
it
is
said
extension
is
a
mode
or
accident
of
matter
and
that
matter
is
the
substratum
that
supports
it
now
i
desire
that
you
would
explain
to
me
what
is
meant
by
matter
supporting
extension
say
you
i
have
no
idea
of
matter
and
therefore
can
not
explain
it
i
answer
though
you
have
no
positive
yet
if
you
have
any
meaning
at
all
you
must
at
least
have
a
relative
idea
of
matter
though
you
know
not
what
it
is
yet
you
must
be
supposed
to
know
what
relation
it
bears
to
accidents
and
what
is
meant
by
its
supporting
them
it
is
evident
support
can
not
here
be
taken
in
its
usual
or
literal
sense
as
when
we
say
that
pillars
support
a
building
in
what
sense
therefore
must
it
be
taken
note
note
for
my
part
i
am
not
able
to
discover
any
sense
at
all
that
can
be
applicable
to
it
edit
philosophical
meaning
of
material
substance
divisible
into
two
if
we
inquire
into
what
the
most
accurate
philosophers
declare
themselves
to
mean
by
material
substance
we
shall
find
them
acknowledge
they
have
no
other
meaning
annexed
to
those
sounds
but
the
idea
of
being
in
general
together
with
the
relative
notion
of
its
supporting
accidents
the
general
idea
of
being
appeareth
to
me
the
most
abstract
and
incomprehensible
of
all
other
and
as
for
its
supporting
accidents
this
as
we
have
just
now
observed
can
not
be
understood
in
the
common
sense
of
those
words
it
must
therefore
be
taken
in
some
other
sense
but
what
that
is
they
do
not
explain
so
that
when
i
consider
the
two
parts
or
branches
which
make
the
signification
of
the
words
material
substance
i
am
convinced
there
is
no
distinct
meaning
annexed
to
them
but
why
should
we
trouble
ourselves
any
farther
in
discussing
this
material
substratum
or
support
of
figure
and
motion
and
other
sensible
qualities
does
it
not
suppose
they
have
an
existence
without
the
mind
and
is
not
this
a
direct
repugnancy
and
altogether
inconceivable
the
existence
of
external
bodies
wants
but
though
it
were
possible
that
solid
figured
movable
substances
may
exist
without
the
mind
corresponding
to
the
ideas
we
have
of
bodies
yet
how
is
it
possible
for
us
to
know
this
either
we
must
know
it
by
sense
or
by
reason
as
for
our
senses
by
them
we
have
the
knowledge
only
of
our
sensations
ideas
or
those
things
that
are
immediately
perceived
by
sense
call
them
what
you
will
but
they
do
not
inform
us
that
things
exist
without
the
mind
or
unperceived
like
to
those
which
are
perceived
this
the
materialists
themselves
acknowledge
it
remains
therefore
that
if
we
have
any
knowledge
at
all
of
external
things
it
must
be
by
reason
inferring
their
existence
from
what
is
immediately
perceived
by
sense
but
what
reason
can
induce
us
to
believe
the
existence
of
bodies
without
the
mind
from
what
we
perceive
since
the
very
patrons
of
matter
themselves
do
not
pretend
there
is
any
necessary
connexion
betwixt
them
and
our
ideas
i
say
it
is
granted
on
all
hands
and
what
happens
in
dreams
phrensies
and
the
like
puts
it
beyond
dispute
that
it
is
possible
we
might
be
affected
with
all
the
ideas
we
have
now
though
there
were
no
bodies
existing
without
resembling
them
hence
it
is
evident
the
supposition
of
external
bodies
is
not
necessary
for
the
producing
our
ideas
since
it
is
granted
they
are
produced
sometimes
and
might
possibly
be
produced
always
in
the
same
order
we
see
them
in
at
present
without
their
concurrence
the
existence
of
external
bodies
affords
no
explication
of
the
manner
in
which
our
ideas
are
but
though
we
might
possibly
have
all
our
sensations
without
them
yet
perhaps
it
may
be
thought
easier
to
conceive
and
explain
the
manner
of
their
production
by
supposing
external
bodies
in
their
likeness
rather
than
otherwise
and
so
it
might
be
at
least
probable
there
are
such
things
as
bodies
that
excite
their
ideas
in
our
minds
but
neither
can
this
be
said
for
though
we
give
the
materialists
their
external
bodies
they
by
their
own
confession
are
never
the
nearer
knowing
how
our
ideas
are
produced
since
they
own
themselves
unable
to
comprehend
in
what
manner
body
can
act
upon
spirit
or
how
it
is
possible
it
should
imprint
any
idea
in
the
mind
hence
it
is
evident
the
production
of
ideas
or
sensations
in
our
minds
can
be
no
reason
why
we
should
suppose
matter
or
corporeal
substances
since
that
is
acknowledged
to
remain
equally
inexplicable
with
or
without
this
supposition
if
therefore
it
were
possible
for
bodies
to
exist
without
the
mind
yet
to
hold
they
do
so
must
needs
be
a
very
precarious
opinion
since
it
is
to
suppose
without
any
reason
at
all
that
god
has
created
innumerable
beings
that
are
entirely
useless
and
serve
to
no
manner
of
purpose
in
short
if
there
were
external
bodies
it
is
impossible
we
should
ever
come
to
know
it
and
if
there
were
not
we
might
have
the
very
same
reasons
to
think
there
were
that
we
have
now
suppose
what
no
one
can
deny
possible
an
intelligence
without
the
help
of
external
bodies
to
be
affected
with
the
same
train
of
sensations
or
ideas
that
you
are
imprinted
in
the
same
order
and
with
like
vividness
in
his
mind
i
ask
whether
that
intelligence
has
not
all
the
reason
to
believe
the
existence
of
corporeal
substances
represented
by
his
ideas
and
exciting
them
in
his
mind
that
you
can
possibly
have
for
believing
the
same
thing
of
this
there
can
be
no
question
which
one
consideration
were
enough
to
make
any
reasonable
person
suspect
the
strength
of
whatever
arguments
be
may
think
himself
to
have
for
the
existence
of
bodies
without
the
mind
were
it
necessary
to
add
any
further
proof
against
the
existence
of
matter
after
what
has
been
said
i
could
instance
several
of
those
errors
and
difficulties
not
to
mention
impieties
which
have
sprung
from
that
tenet
it
has
occasioned
numberless
controversies
and
disputes
in
philosophy
and
not
a
few
of
far
greater
moment
in
religion
but
i
shall
not
enter
into
the
detail
of
them
in
this
place
as
well
because
i
think
arguments
a
posteriori
are
unnecessary
for
confirming
what
has
been
if
i
mistake
not
sufficiently
demonstrated
a
priori
as
because
i
shall
hereafter
find
occasion
to
speak
somewhat
of
them
i
am
afraid
i
have
given
cause
to
think
i
am
needlessly
prolix
in
handling
this
subject
for
to
what
purpose
is
it
to
dilate
on
that
which
may
be
demonstrated
with
the
utmost
evidence
in
a
line
or
two
to
any
one
that
is
capable
of
the
least
reflexion
it
is
but
looking
into
your
own
thoughts
and
so
trying
whether
you
can
conceive
it
possible
for
a
sound
or
figure
or
motion
or
colour
to
exist
without
the
mind
or
unperceived
this
easy
trial
may
perhaps
make
you
see
that
what
you
contend
for
is
a
downright
contradiction
insomuch
that
i
am
content
to
put
the
whole
upon
this
issue
if
you
can
but
conceive
it
possible
for
one
extended
movable
substance
or
in
general
for
any
one
idea
or
anything
like
an
idea
to
exist
otherwise
than
in
a
mind
perceiving
it
i
shall
readily
give
up
the
cause
and
as
for
all
that
compages
of
external
bodies
you
contend
for
i
shall
grant
you
its
existence
though
you
can
not
either
give
me
any
reason
why
you
believe
it
exists
vide
sect
lviii
or
assign
any
use
to
it
when
it
is
supposed
to
exist
vide
sect
i
say
the
bare
possibility
of
your
opinions
being
true
shall
pass
for
an
argument
that
it
is
so
note
although
your
argument
be
deficient
in
the
two
requisites
of
an
ed
but
say
you
surely
there
is
nothing
easier
than
for
me
to
imagine
trees
for
instance
in
a
park
or
books
existing
in
a
closet
and
nobody
by
to
perceive
them
i
answer
you
may
so
there
is
no
difficulty
in
it
but
what
is
all
this
i
beseech
you
more
than
framing
in
your
mind
certain
ideas
which
you
call
books
and
trees
and
the
same
time
omitting
to
frame
the
idea
of
any
one
that
may
perceive
them
but
do
not
you
yourself
perceive
or
think
of
them
all
the
while
this
therefore
is
nothing
to
the
purpose
it
only
shows
you
have
the
power
of
imagining
or
forming
ideas
in
your
mind
but
it
does
not
show
that
you
can
conceive
it
possible
the
objects
of
your
thought
may
exist
without
the
mind
to
make
out
this
it
is
necessary
that
you
conceive
them
existing
unconceived
or
unthought
of
which
is
a
manifest
repugnancy
when
we
do
our
utmost
to
conceive
the
existence
of
external
bodies
we
are
all
the
while
only
contemplating
our
own
ideas
but
the
mind
taking
no
notice
of
itself
is
deluded
to
think
it
can
and
does
conceive
bodies
existing
unthought
of
or
without
the
mind
though
at
the
same
time
they
are
apprehended
by
or
exist
in
itself
a
little
attention
will
discover
to
any
one
the
truth
and
evidence
of
what
is
here
said
and
make
it
unnecessary
to
insist
on
any
other
proofs
against
the
existence
of
material
substance
the
absolute
existence
of
unthinking
things
are
words
without
a
it
is
very
obvious
upon
the
least
inquiry
into
our
thoughts
to
know
whether
it
is
possible
for
us
to
understand
what
is
meant
by
the
absolute
existence
of
sensible
objects
in
themselves
or
without
the
mind
to
me
it
is
evident
those
words
mark
out
either
a
direct
contradiction
or
else
nothing
at
all
and
to
convince
others
of
this
i
know
no
readier
or
fairer
way
than
to
entreat
they
would
calmly
attend
to
their
own
thoughts
and
if
by
this
attention
the
emptiness
or
repugnancy
of
those
expressions
does
appear
surely
nothing
more
is
requisite
for
the
conviction
it
is
on
this
therefore
that
i
insist
to
wit
that
the
absolute
existence
of
unthinking
things
are
words
without
a
meaning
or
which
include
a
contradiction
this
is
what
i
repeat
and
inculcate
and
earnestly
recommend

attentive
thoughts
of

refutation
of
all
our
ideas

or
the
things
which
we
perceive
by
whatsoever
names
they
may
be
distinguished
are
visibly
inactive
there
is
nothing
of
power
or
agency
included
in
them
so
that
one
idea
or
object
of
thought
can
not
produce
or
make
any
alteration
in
another
to
be
satisfied
of
the
truth
of
this
there
is
nothing
else
requisite
but
a
bare
observation
of
our
ideas
for
since
they
and
every
part
of
them
exist
only
in
the
mind
it
follows
that
there
is
nothing
in
them
but
what
is
perceived
but
whoever
shall
attend
to
his
ideas
whether
of
sense
or
reflexion
will
not
perceive
in
them
any
power
or
activity
there
is
therefore
no
such
thing
contained
in
them
a
little
attention
will
discover
to
us
that
the
very
being
of
an
idea
implies
passiveness
and
inertness
in
it
insomuch
that
it
is
impossible
for
an
idea
to
do
anything
or
strictly
speaking
to
be
the
cause
of
anything
neither
can
it
be
the
resemblance
or
pattern
of
any
active
being
as
is
evident
from
sect
whence
it
plainly
follows
that
extension
figure
and
motion
can
not
be
the
cause
of
our
sensations
to
say
therefore
that
these
are
the
effects
of
powers
resulting
from
the
configuration

and
size
of

cause
of
we
perceive
a
continual
succession
of

or

there
is
therefore
some
cause
of
these
ideas
whereon
they
depend
and
which
produces
and
changes
them
that
this
cause
can
not
be
any
quality
or
idea
or
combination
of

is
clear
from
the
preceding
section
it
must
therefore
be
a
substance
but
it
has
been
shown
that
there
is
no
corporeal
or
material
substance
it
remains
therefore
that
the
cause
of
ideas
is
an
incorporeal
active
substance
or
spirit
no
idea
of
a
spirit
is
one
simple
undivided
active
being
as
it
perceives

it
is
called
the
understanding
and
as
it
produces
or
otherwise
operates
about
them
it
is
called
the
will
hence
there
can
be
no
idea
formed
of
a
soul
or
spirit
for
all
ideas

being
passive

inert

they
can
not
represent
unto
us
by

it
plain
to
any
one
that
to
have
an
idea
which
shall
be
like
that
active
principle
of
motion
and

of
ideas
is
absolutely
impossible
such
is
the
nature
of
spirit
or
that
which
acts

it
can
not
be
of
itself
perceived
but
only
by
the
effects
which
it
produceth
if
any
man
shall
doubt
of
the
truth
of
what
is
here
delivered
let
him
but
reflect
and
try
if
he
can
frame
the
idea
of
any
power
or
active
being
and
whether
he
has
ideas
of
two
principal
powers
marked
by
the
names
will
and
understanding
distinct
from
each
other
as
well
as
from
a
third
idea
of
substance

being
in

with
a
relative
notion
of
its
supporting

being
the
subject

for
something
which

very
different
from

and
which
being
an
agent
can
not
be
like
unto
or
represented
by
any
idea
whatsoever
though
it
must
be
owned
at
the

time
that
we
have
some
notion
of

as

we
know

at
pleasure
and
vary
and
shift

as
oft
as
i
think
fit
it
is
no
more
than
willing
and
straightway
this
or
that
idea
arises
in
my
fancy
and
by
the
same
power
it
is
obliterated
and
makes
way
for
another

making

unmaking

very
properly
denominate

thus
much
is
certain
and
grounded
on
experience
but
when
we
think
of
unthinking
agents
or
of
exciting
ideas
exclusive
of
volition
we
only
amuse
ourselves
with
words
ideas
of
sensation
differ
from
those
of
reflection
or
but
whatever
power
i
may
have
over
my
own
thoughts
i
find
the
ideas
actually
perceived
by
sense
have
not
a
like
dependence
on
my
will
when
in
broad
daylight
i
open
my
eyes
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
choose
whether
i
shall
see
or
no

to
determine
what
particular
objects
shall
present
themselves
to
my
view
and
so
likewise
as
to
the
hearing
and
other
senses
the
ideas
imprinted
on
them
are
not
creatures

will
there
is
therefore
some

as
those
which

the

of

often
are

in
a
regular
train

whereof
sufficiently
testifies
the
wisdom
and

of
its
author
now
the

in
us

called
the
laws
of
nature
and
these
we
learn
by
experience
which
teaches
us
that
such
and
such
ideas
are
attended
with
such
and
such
other
ideas
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
knowledge
of
them
necessary
for
the
conduct
of
worldly
this
gives
us
a
sort
of
foresight
which
enables
us
to
regulate
our
actions
for
the
benefit
of
life
and
without
this
we
should
be
eternally
at
a
loss
we
could
not
know
how
to
act
anything
that
might
procure
us
the
least
pleasure
or
remove
the
least
pain
of
sense
that
food
nourishes
sleep
refreshes
and
fire
warms
us
that
to
sow
in
the
is
the
way
to
reap
in
the
harvest
and
in
general
that
to
obtain
such
or
such
ends
such
or
such
means
are
conducive
all
this
we
know
not
by
discovering
any
necessary
connexion
between
our
ideas
but
only
by
the
observation
of
the
settled
laws
of
nature
without
which
we
should
be
all
in
uncertainty
and
confusion
and
a
grown
man
no
more
know
how
to
manage
himself
in
the
affairs
of
life
than
an
infant
just
born
and
yet
this
consistent
uniform
working
which
so
evidently
displays
the
goodness
and
wisdom
of
that
governing
spirit
whose
will
constitutes
the
laws
of
nature
is
so
far
from
leading
our
thoughts
to
him
that
it
rather
sends
them
a
wandering
after
second
causes
for
when
we
perceive
certain
ideas
of
sense
constantly
followed
by
other
ideas
and
we
know
this
is
not
of
our
own
doing
we
forthwith
attribute
power
and
agency
to
the
ideas
themselves
and
make
one
the
cause
of
another
than
which
nothing
can
be
more
absurd
and
unintelligible
thus
for
example
having
observed
that
when
we
perceive
by
sight
a
certain
round
luminous
figure
we
at
the
same
time
perceive
by
touch
the
idea
or
sensation
called
heat
we
do
from
thence
conclude
the
sun
to
be
the
cause
of
heat
and
in
like
manner
perceiving
the
motion
and
collision
of
bodies
to
be
attended
with
sound
we
are
inclined
to
think
the
latter
the
effect
of
the
former
of
real
things
and
ideas
or
the
ideas
imprinted
on
the
senses
by
the
author
of
nature
are
called
real
things
and
those
excited
in
the
imagination
being
less
regular
vivid
and
constant
are
more
properly
termed
ideas
or
images
of
things
which
they
copy
and
represent
but
then
our
sensations
be
they
never
so
vivid
and
distinct
are
nevertheless
ideas
that
is
they
exist
in
the
mind
or
are
perceived
by
it
as
truly
as
the
ideas
of
its
own
framing
the
ideas
of
sense
are
allowed
to
have
more
reality
in
them
that
is
to
be
more
strong
orderly
and
coherent
than
the
creatures
of
the
mind
but
this
is
no
argument
that
they
exist
without
the
mind
they
are
also
less
dependent
on
the
spirit

perceives
them

yet
still
they
are
ideas
and
certainly
no
idea
whether
faint
or
strong

exist
otherwise
than
in
a
mind
perceiving
it
first
general
before
we
proceed
any
farther
it
is
necessary
we
spend
some
time
in
answering
objections
which
may
probably
be
made
against
the
principles
we
have
hitherto
laid
down
in
doing
of
which
if
i
seem
too
prolix
to
those
of
quick
apprehensions
i
hope
it
may
be
pardoned
since
all
men
do
not
equally
apprehend
things
of
this
nature
and
i
am
willing
to
be
understood
by
every
one
first
then
it
will
be
objected
that
by
the
foregoing
principles
all
that
is
real
and
substantial
in
nature
is
banished
out
of
the
world
and
instead
thereof
a
chimerical
scheme
of
ideas
takes
place
all
things
that
exist
exist
only
in
the
mind
that
is
they
are
purely
notional
what
therefore
becomes
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
what
must
we
think
of
houses
rivers
mountains
trees
stones
nay
even
of
our
own
bodies
are
all
these
but
so
many
chimeras
and
illusions
on
the
fancy
to
all
which
and
whatever
else
of
the
same
sort
may
be
objected
i
answer
that
by
the
principles
premised
we
are
not
deprived
of
any
one
thing
in
nature
whatever
we
see
feel
hear
or
anywise
conceive
or
understand
remains
as
secure
as
ever
and
is
as
real
as
ever
there
is
a
rerum
natura
and
the
distinction
between
realities
and
chimeras
retains
its
full
force
this
is
evident
from
sect
and
where
we
have
shown
what
is
meant
by
real
things
in
opposition
to
chimeras
or
ideas
of
our
own
framing
but
then
they
both
equally
exist
in
the
mind
and
in
that
sense
they
are
alike
ideas
the
existence
of
matter
as
understood
by
philosophers
denied
vide
sect
lxxxiv
i
do
not
argue
against
the
existence
of
any
one
thing
that
we
can
apprehend
either
by
sense
or
reflexion
that
the
things
i
see
with
my
eyes
and
touch
with
my
hands
do
exist
really
exist
i
make
not
the
least
question
the
only
thing
whose
existence
we
deny
is
that
which
philosophers
call
matter
or
corporeal
substance
and
in
doing
of
this
there
is
no
damage
done
to
the
rest
of
mankind
who
i
dare
say
will
never
miss
it
the
atheist
indeed
will
want
the
colour
of
an
empty
name
to
support
his
impiety
and
the
philosophers
may
possibly
find
they
have
lost
a
great
handle
for
trifling
and
disputation
readily
if
any
man
thinks
this
detracts
from
the
existence
or
reality
of
things
he
is
very
far
from
understanding
what
has
been
premised
in
the
plainest
terms
i
could
think
of
take
here
an
abstract
of
what
has
been
said
there
are
spiritual
substances
minds
or
human
souls
which
will
or
excite
ideas
in
themselves
at
pleasure
but
these
are
faint
weak
and
unsteady
in
respect
of
others
they
perceive
by
sense
which
being
impressed
upon
them
according
to
certain
rules
or
laws
of
nature
speak
themselves
the
effects
of
a
mind
more
powerful
and
wise
than
human
spirits
these
latter
are
said
to
have
more
reality
in
them
than
the
former
by
which
is
meant
that
they
are
more
affecting
orderly
and
distinct
and
that
they
are
not
fictions
of
the
mind
perceiving
them
and
in
this
sense
the
sun
that
i
see
by
day
is
the
real
sun
and
that
which
i
imagine
by
night
is
the
idea
of
the
former
in
the
sense
here
given
of
reality
it
is
evident
that
every
vegetable
star
mineral
and
in
general
each
part
of
the
mundane
system
is
as
much
a
real
being
by
our
principles
as
by
any
other
whether
others
mean
anything
by
the
term
reality
different
from
what
i
do
i
entreat
them
to
look
into
their
own
thoughts
and
see
the
philosophic
not
the
vulgar
substance
taken
i
will
be
urged
that
thus
much
at
least
is
true
to
wit
that
we
take
away
all
corporeal
substances
to
this
my
answer
is
that
if
the
word
substance
be
taken
in
the
vulgar
sense
for
a
combination
of
sensible
qualities
such
as
extension
solidity
weight
and
the
like
this
we
can
not
be
accused
of
taking
away
but
if
it
be
taken
in
a
philosophic
sense
for
the
support
of
accidents
or
qualities
without
the
mind
then
indeed
i
acknowledge
that
we
take
it
away
if
one
may
be
said
to
take
away
that
which
never
had
any
existence
not
even
in
the
imagination
but
say
you
it
sounds
very
harsh
to
say
we
eat
and
drink
ideas
and
are
clothed
with
ideas
i
acknowledge
it
does
so
the
word
idea
not
being
used
in
common
discourse
to
signify
the
several
combinations
of
sensible
qualities
which
are
called
things
and
it
is
certain
that
any
expression
which
varies
from
the
familiar
use
of
language
will
seem
harsh
and
ridiculous
but
this
doth
not
concern
the
truth
of
the
proposition
which
in
other
words
is
no
more
than
to
say
we
are
fed
and
clothed
with
those
things
which
we
perceive
immediately
by
our
senses
the
hardness
or
softness
the
colour
taste
warmth
figure
or
suchlike
qualities
which
combined
together
constitute
the
several
sorts
of
victuals
and
apparel
have
been
shown
to
exist
only
in
the
mind
that
perceives
them
and
this
is
all
that
is
meant
by
calling
them
ideas
which
word
if
it
was
as
ordinarily
used
as
thing
would
sound
no
harsher
nor
more
ridiculous
than
it
i
am
not
for
disputing
about
the
propriety
but
the
truth
of
the
expression
if
therefore
you
agree
with
me
that
we
eat
and
drink
and
are
clad
with
the
immediate
objects
of
sense
which
can
not
exist
unperceived
or
without
the
mind
i
shall
readily
grant
it
is
more
proper
or
conformable
to
custom
that
they
should
be
called
things
rather
than
ideas
the
term
idea
preferable
to
if
it
be
demanded
why
i
make
use
of
the
word
idea
and
do
not
rather
in
compliance
with
custom
call
them
things
i
answer
i
do
it
for
two
reasons
first
because
the
term
thing
in
to
idea
is
generally
supposed
to
denote
somewhat
existing
without
the
mind
secondly
because
thing
has
a
more
comprehensive
signification
than
idea
including
spirit
or
thinking
things
as
well
as
ideas
since
therefore
the
objects
of
sense
exist
only
in
the
mind
and
are
withal
thoughtless
and
inactive
i
chose
to
mark
them
by
the
word
idea
which
implies
those
properties
the
evidence
of
the
senses
not
but
say
what
we
can
some
one
perhaps
may
be
apt
to
reply
he
will
still
believe
his
senses
and
never
suffer
any
arguments
how
plausible
soever
to
prevail
over
the
certainty
of
them
be
it
so
assert
the
evidence
of
sense
as
high
as
you
please
we
are
willing
to
do
the
same
that
what
i
see
hear
and
feel
doth
exist
that
is
to
say
is
perceived
by
me
i
no
more
doubt
than
i
do
of
my
own
being
but
i
do
not
see
how
the
testimony
of
sense
can
be
alleged
as
a
proof
for
the
existence
of
anything
which
is
not
perceived
by
sense
we
are
not
for
having
any
man
turn
sceptic
and
disbelieve
his
senses
on
the
contrary
we
give
them
all
the
stress
and
assurance
imaginable
nor
are
there
any
principles
more
opposite
to
scepticism
than
those
we
have
laid
down
note
as
shall
be
hereafter
clearly
shown
note
they
extirpate
the
very
root
of
scepticism
the
fallacy
of
the
ed
second
secondly
it
will
be
objected
that
there
is
a
great
difference
betwixt
real
fire
for
instance
and
the
idea
of
fire
betwixt
dreaming
or
imagining
oneself
burnt
and
actually
being
so
if
you
suspect
it
to
be
only
the
idea
of
fire
which
you
see
do
but
put
your
hand
into
it
and
you
will
be
convinced
with
a
witness
this
and
the
like
may
be
urged
in
opposition
to
our
tenets
to
all
which
the
answer
is
evident
from
what
has
been
already
said
and
i
shall
only
add
in
this
place
that
if
real
fire
be
very
different
from
the
idea
of
fire
so
also
is
the
real
pain
that
it
occasions
very
different
from
the
idea
of
the
same
pain
and
yet
nobody
will
pretend
that
real
pain
either
is
or
can
possibly
be
in
an
unperceiving
thing
or
without
the
mind
any
more
than
its
idea
third
thirdly
it
will
be
objected
that
we
see
things
actually
without
or
at
distance
from
us
and
which
consequently
do
not
exist
in
the
mind
it
being
absurd
that
those
things
which
are
seen
at
the
distance
of
several
miles
should
be
as
near
to
us
as
our
own
thoughts
in
answer
to
this
i
desire
it
may
be
considered
that
in
a
dream
we
do
oft
perceive
things
as
existing
at
a
great
distance
off
and
yet
for
all
that
those
things
are
acknowledged
to
have
their
existence
only
in
the
mind
but
for
the
fuller
clearing
of
this
point
it
may
be
worth
while
to
consider
how
it
is
that
we
perceive
distance
and
things
placed
at
a
distance
by
sight
for
that
we
should
in
truth
see
external
space
and
bodies
actually
existing
in
it
some
nearer
others
farther
off
seems
to
carry
with
it
some
opposition
to
what
has
been
said
of
their
existing
nowhere
without
the
mind
the
consideration
of
this
difficulty
it
was
that
gave
birth
to
my
essay
towards
a
new
theory
of
vision
which
was
published
not
long
since
wherein
it
is
shown
that
distance
or
outness
is
neither
immediately
of
itself
perceived
by
sight
nor
yet
apprehended
or
judged
of
by
lines
and
angles
or
anything
that
has
a
necessary
connexion
with
it
but
that
it
is
only
suggested
to
our
thoughts
by
certain
visible
ideas
and
sensations
attending
vision
which
in
their
own
nature
have
no
manner
of
similitude
or
relation
either
with
distance
or
things
placed
at
a
distance
but
by
a
connexion
taught
us
by
experience
they
come
to
signify
and
suggest
them
to
us
after
the
same
manner
that
words
of
any
language
suggest
the
ideas
they
are
made
to
stand
for
insomuch
that
a
man
born
blind
and
afterwards
made
to
see
would
not
at
first
sight
think
the
things
he
saw
to
be
without
his
mind
or
at
any
distance
from
him
see
sect
of
the
treatise
the
ideas
of
sight
and
touch
make
two
species
entirely
distinct
and
heterogeneous
the
former
are
marks
and
prognostics
of
the
latter
that
the
proper
objects
of
sight
neither
exist
without
mind
nor
are
the
images
of
external
things
was
shown
even
in
that
treatise
though
throughout
the
same
the
contrary
be
supposed
true
of
tangible
objects
not
that
to
suppose
that
vulgar
error
was
necessary
for
establishing
the
notion
therein
laid
down
but
because
it
was
beside
my
purpose
to
examine
and
refute
it
in
a
discourse
concerning
vision
so
that
in
strict
truth
the
ideas
of
sight
when
we
apprehend
by
them
distance
and
things
placed
at
a
distance
do
not
suggest
or
mark
out
to
us
things
actually
existing
at
a
distance
but
only
admonish
us
what
ideas
of
touch
will
be
imprinted
in
our
minds
at
such
and
such
distances
of
time
and
in
consequence
of
such
or
such
actions
it
is
i
say
evident
from
what
has
been
said
in
the
foregoing
parts
of
this
treatise
and
in
sect
and
elsewhere
of
the
essay
concerning
vision
that
visible
ideas
are
the
language
whereby
the
governing
spirit
on
whom
we
depend
informs
us
what
tangible
ideas
he
is
about
to
imprint
upon
us
in
case
we
excite
this
or
that
motion
in
our
own
bodies
but
for
a
fuller
information
in
this
point
i
refer
to
the
essay
itself
fourth
objection
from
perpetual
annihilation
and
fourthly
it
will
be
objected
that
from
the
foregoing
principles
it
follows
things
are
every
moment
annihilated
and
created
anew
the
objects
of
sense
exist
only
when
they
are
perceived
the
trees
therefore
are
in
the
garden
or
the
chairs
in
the
parlour
no
longer
than
while
there
is
somebody
by
to
perceive
them
upon
shutting
my
eyes
all
the
furniture
in
the
room
is
reduced
to
nothing
and
barely
upon
opening
them
it
is
again
created
in
answer
to
all
which
i
refer
the
reader
to
what
has
been
said
in
sect
and
desire
he
will
consider
whether
he
means
anything
by
the
actual
existence
of
an
idea
distinct
from
its
being
perceived
for
my
part
after
the
nicest
inquiry
i
could
make
i
am
not
able
to
discover
that
anything
else
is
meant
by
those
words
and
i
once
more
entreat
the
reader
to
sound
his
own
thoughts
and
not
suffer
himself
to
be
imposed
on
by
words
if
he
can
conceive
it
possible
either
for
his
ideas
or
their
archetypes
to
exist
without
being
perceived
then
i
give
up
the
cause
but
if
he
can
not
he
will
acknowledge
it
is
unreasonable
for
him
to
stand
up
in
defence
of
he
knows
not
what
and
pretend
to
charge
on
me
as
an
absurdity
the
not
assenting
to
those
propositions
which
at
bottom
have
no
meaning
in
them
argumentum
ad
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
observe
how
far
the
received
principles
of
philosophy
are
themselves
chargeable
with
those
pretended
absurdities
it
is
thought
strangely
absurd
that
upon
closing
my
eyelids
all
the
visible
objects
around
me
should
be
reduced
to
nothing
and
yet
is
not
this
what
philosophers
commonly
acknowledge
when
they
agree
on
all
hands
that
light
and
colours
which
alone
are
the
proper
and
immediate
objects
of
sight
are
mere
sensations
that
exist
no
longer
than
they
are
perceived
again
it
may
to
some
perhaps
seem
very
incredible
that
things
should
be
every
moment
creating
yet
this
very
notion
is
commonly
taught
in
the
schools
for
the
schoolmen
though
they
acknowledge
the
existence
of
matter
and
that
the
whole
mundane
fabric
is
framed
out
of
it
are
nevertheless
of
opinion
that
it
can
not
subsist
without
the
divine
conservation
which
by
them
is
expounded
to
be
a
continual
creation
further
a
little
thought
will
discover
to
us
that
though
we
allow
the
existence
of
matter
or
corporeal
substance
yet
it
will
unavoidably
follow
from
the
principles
which
are
now
generally
admitted
that
the
particular
bodies
of
what
kind
soever
do
none
of
them
exist
whilst
they
are
not
perceived
for
it
is
evident
from
sect
ii
and
the
following
sections
that
the
matter
philosophers
contend
for
is
an
incomprehensible
somewhat
which
has
none
of
those
particular
qualities
whereby
the
bodies
falling
under
our
senses
are
distinguished
one
from
another
but
to
make
this
more
plain
it
must
be
remarked
that
the
infinite
divisibility
of
matter
is
now
universally
allowed
at
least
by
the
most
approved
and
considerable
philosophers
who
on
the
received
principles
demonstrate
it
beyond
all
exception
hence
it
follows
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
parts
in
each
particle
of
matter
which
are
not
perceived
by
sense
the
reason
therefore
that
any
particular
body
seems
to
be
of
a
finite
magnitude
or
exhibits
only
a
finite
number
of
parts
to
sense
is
not
because
it
contains
no
more
since
in
itself
it
contains
an
infinite
number
of
parts
but
because
the
sense
is
not
acute
enough
to
discern
them
in
proportion
therefore
as
the
sense
is
rendered
more
acute
it
perceives
a
greater
number
of
parts
in
the
object
that
is
the
object
appears
greater
and
its
figure
varies
those
parts
in
its
extremities
which
were
before
unperceivable
appearing
now
to
bound
it
in
very
different
lines
and
angles
from
those
perceived
by
an
obtuser
sense
and
at
length
after
various
changes
of
size
and
shape
when
the
sense
becomes
infinitely
acute
the
body
shall
seem
infinite
during
all
which
there
is
no
alteration
in
the
body
but
only
in
the
sense
each
body
therefore
considered
in
itself
is
infinitely
extended
and
consequently
void
of
all
shape
or
figure
from
which
it
follows
that
though
we
should
grant
the
existence
of
matter
to
be
never
so
certain
yet
it
is
withal
as
certain
the
materialists
themselves
are
by
their
own
principles
forced
to
acknowledge
that
neither
the
particular
bodies
perceived
by
sense
nor
anything
like
them
exists
without
the
mind
matter
i
say
and
each
particle
thereof
is
according
to
them
infinite
and
shapeless
and
it
is
the
mind
that
frames
all
that
variety
of
bodies
which
compose
the
visible
world
any
one
whereof
does
not
exist
longer
than
it
is
perceived
if
we
consider
it
the
objection
proposed
in
sect
will
not
be
found
reasonably
charged
on
the
principles
we
have
premised
so
as
in
truth
to
make
any
objection
at
all
against
our
notions
for
though
we
hold
indeed
the
objects
of
sense
to
be
nothing
else
but
ideas
which
can
not
exist
unperceived
yet
we
may
not
hence
conclude
they
have
no
existence
except
only
while
they
are
perceived
by
us
since
there
may
be
some
other
spirit
that
perceives
them
though
we
do
not
wherever
bodies
are
said
to
have
no
existence
without
the
mind
i
would
not
be
understood
to
mean
this
or
that
particular
mind
but
all
minds
whatsoever
it
does
not
therefore
follow
from
the
foregoing
principles
that
bodies
are
annihilated
and
created
every
moment
or
exist
not
at
all
during
the
intervals
between
our
perception
of
them
fifth
fifthly
it
may
perhaps
be
objected
that
if
extension
and
figure
exist
only
in
the
mind
it
follows
that
the
mind
is
extended
and
figured
since
extension
is
a
mode
or
attribute
which
to
speak
with
the
schools
is
predicated
of
the
subject
in
which
it
exists
i
answer
those
qualities
are
in
the
mind
only
as
they
are
perceived
by
it
that
is
not
by
way
of
mode
or
attribute
but
only
by
way
of
idea
and
it
no
more
follows
the
soul
or
mind
is
extended
because
extension
exists
in
it
alone
than
it
does
that
it
is
red
or
blue
because
those
colours
are
on
all
hands
acknowledged
to
exist
in
it
and
nowhere
else
as
to
what
philosophers
say
of
subject
and
mode
that
seems
very
groundless
and
unintelligible
for
instance
in
this
proposition
a
die
is
hard
extended
and
square
they
will
have
it
that
the
word
die
denotes
a
subject
or
substance
distinct
from
the
hardness
extension
and
figure
which
are
predicated
of
it
and
in
which
they
exist
this
i
can
not
comprehend
to
me
a
die
seems
to
be
nothing
distinct
from
those
things
which
are
termed
its
modes
or
accidents
and
to
say
a
die
is
hard
extended
and
square
is
not
to
attribute
those
qualities
to
a
subject
distinct
from
and
supporting
them
but
only
an
explication
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
die
sixth
objection
from

sixthly
you
will
say
there
have
been
a
great
many
things
explained
by
matter
and
motion
take
away
these
and
you
destroy
the
whole
corpuscular
philosophy
and
undermine
those
mechanical
principles
which
have
been
applied
with
so
much
success
to
account
for
the
phenomena
in
short
whatever
advances
have
been
made
either
by
ancient
or
modern
philosophers
in
the
study
of
nature
do
all
proceed
on
the
supposition
that
corporeal
substance
or
matter
doth
really
exist
to
this
i
answer
that
there
is
not
any
one
phenomenon
explained
on
that
supposition
which
may
not
as
well
be
explained
without
it
as
might
easily
be
made
appear
by
an
induction
of
particulars
to
explain
the
phenomena
is
all
one
as
to
show
why
upon
such
and
such
occasions
we
are
affected
with
such
and
such
ideas
but
how
matter
should
operate
on
a
spirit
or
produce
any
idea
in
it
is
what
no
philosopher
will
pretend
to
explain
it
is
therefore
evident
there
can
be
no
use
of
matter
in
natural
philosophy
besides
they
who
attempt
to
account
for
things
do
it
not
by
corporeal
substance
but
by
figure
motion
and
other
qualities
which
are
in
truth
no
more
than
mere
ideas
and
therefore
can
not
be
the
cause
of
anything
as
has
been
already
shown
see
sect
seventh
seventhly
it
will
upon
this
be
demanded
whether
it
does
not
seem
absurd
to
take
away
natural
causes
and
ascribe
everything
to
the
immediate
operation
of
spirits
we
must
no
longer
say
upon
these
principles
that
fire
heats
or
water
cools
but
that
a
spirit
heats
and
so
forth
would
not
a
man
be
deservedly
laughed
at
who
should
talk
after
this
manner
i
answer
he
would
so
in
such
things
we
ought
to
think
with
the
learned
and
speak
with
the
vulgar
they
who
to
demonstration
are
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
copernican
system
do
nevertheless
say
the
sun
rises
the
sun
sets
or
comes
to
the
meridian
and
if
they
affected
a
contrary
style
in
common
talk
it
would
without
doubt
appear
very
ridiculous
a
little
reflexion
on
what
is
here
said
will
make
it
manifest
that
the
common
use
of
language
would
receive
no
manner
of
alteration
or
disturbance
from
the
admission
of
our
tenets
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
any
phrases
may
be
retained
so
long
as
they
excite
in
us
proper
sentiments
or
dispositions
to
act
in
such
a
manner
as
is
necessary
for
our
how
false
soever
they
may
be
if
taken
in
a
strict
and
speculative
sense
nay
this
is
unavoidable
since
propriety
being
regulated
by
custom
language
is
suited
to
the
received
opinions
which
are
not
always
the
truest
hence
it
is
impossible
even
in
the
most
rigid
philosophic
reasonings
so
far
to
alter
the
bent
and
genius
of
the
tongue
we
speak
as
never
to
give
a
handle
for
cavillers
to
pretend
difficulties
and
inconsistencies
but
a
fair
and
ingenuous
reader
will
collect
the
sense
from
the
scope
and
tenor
and
connexion
of
a
discourse
making
allowances
for
those
inaccurate
modes
of
speech
which
use
has
made
inevitable
as
to
the
opinion
that
there
are
no
corporeal
causes
this
has
been
heretofore
maintained
by
some
of
the
schoolmen
as
it
is
of
late
by
others
among
the
modern
philosophers
who
though
they
allow
matter
to
exist
yet
will
have
god
alone
to
be
the
immediate
efficient
cause
of
all
things
these
men
saw
that
amongst
all
the
objects
of
sense
there
was
none
which
had
any
power
or
activity
included
in
it
and
that
by
consequence
this
was
likewise
true
of
whatever
bodies
they
supposed
to
exist
without
the
mind
like
unto
the
immediate
objects
of
sense
but
then
that
they
should
suppose
an
innumerable
multitude
of
created
beings
which
they
acknowledge
are
not
capable
of
producing
any
one
effect
in
nature
and
which
therefore
are
made
to
no
manner
of
purpose
since
god
might
have
done
everything
as
well
without
them
this
i
say
though
we
should
allow
it
possible
must
yet
be
a
very
unaccountable
and
extravagant
supposition
eighth
twofold
in
the
eighth
place
the
universal
concurrent
assent
of
mankind
may
be
thought
by
some
an
invincible
argument
in
behalf
of
matter
or
the
existence
of
external
things
must
we
suppose
the
whole
world
to
be
mistaken
and
if
so
what
cause
can
be
assigned
of
so
widespread
and
predominant
an
error
i
answer
first
that
upon
a
narrow
inquiry
it
will
not
perhaps
be
found
so
many
as
is
imagined
do
really
believe
the
existence
of
matter
or
things
without
the
mind
strictly
speaking
to
believe
that
which
involves
a
contradiction
or
has
no
meaning
in
it
is
impossible
and
whether
the
foregoing
expressions
are
not
of
that
sort
i
refer
it
to
the
impartial
examination
of
the
reader
in
one
sense
indeed
men
may
be
said
to
believe
that
matter
exists
that
is
they
act
as
if
the
immediate
cause
of
their
sensations
which
affects
them
every
moment
and
is
so
nearly
present
to
them
were
some
senseless
unthinking
being
but
that
they
should
clearly
apprehend
any
meaning
marked
by
those
words
and
form
thereof
a
settled
speculative
opinion
is
what
i
am
not
able
to
conceive
this
is
not
the
only
instance
wherein
men
impose
upon
themselves
by
imagining
they
believe
those
propositions
which
they
have
often
heard
though
at
bottom
they
have
no
meaning
in
them
but
secondly
though
we
should
grant
a
notion
to
be
never
so
universally
and
steadfastly
adhered
to
yet
this
is
weak
argument
of
its
truth
to
whoever
considers
what
a
vast
number
of
prejudices
and
false
opinions
are
everywhere
embraced
with
the
utmost
tenaciousness
by
the
unreflecting
which
are
the
far
greater
part
of
mankind
there
was
a
time
when
the
antipodes
and
motion
of
the
earth
were
looked
upon
as
monstrous
absurdities
even
by
men
of
learning
and
if
it
be
considered
what
a
small
proportion
they
bear
to
the
rest
of
mankind
we
shall
find
that
at
this
day
those
notions
have
gained
but
a
very
inconsiderable
footing
in
the
world
ninth
but
it
is
demanded
that
we
assign
a
cause
of
this
prejudice
and
account
for
its
obtaining
in
the
world
to
this
i
answer
that
men
knowing
they
perceived
several
ideas
whereof
they
themselves
were
not
the
authors
as
not
being
excited
from
within
nor
depending
on
the
operation
of
their
wills
this
made
them
maintain
those
ideas
or
objects
of
perception
had
an
existence
independent
of
and
without
the
mind
without
ever
dreaming
that
a
contradiction
was
involved
in
those
words
but
philosophers
having
plainly
seen
that
the
immediate
objects
of
perception
do
not
exist
without
the
mind
they
in
some
degree
corrected
the
mistake
of
the
vulgar
but
at
the
same
time
run
into
another
which
seems
no
less
absurd
to
wit
that
there
are
certain
objects
really
existing
without
the
mind
or
having
a
subsistence
distinct
from
being
perceived
of
which
our
ideas
are
only
images
or
resemblances
imprinted
by
those
objects
on
the
mind
and
this
notion
of
the
philosophers
owes
its
origin
to
the
same
cause
with
the
former
namely
their
being
conscious
that
they
were
not
the
authors
of
their
own
sensations
which
they
evidently
knew
were
imprinted
from
without
and
which
therefore
must
have
some
cause
distinct
from
the
minds
on
which
they
are
imprinted
but
why
they
should
suppose
the
ideas
of
sense
to
be
excited
in
us
by
things
in
their
likeness
and
not
rather
have
recourse
to
spirit
which
alone
can
act
may
be
accounted
for
first
because
they
were
not
aware
of
the
repugnancy
there
is
as
well
in
supposing
things
like
unto
our
ideas
existing
without
as
in
attributing
to
them
power
or
activity
secondly
because
the
supreme
spirit
which
excites
those
ideas
in
our
minds
is
not
marked
out
and
limited
to
our
view
by
any
particular
finite
collection
of
sensible
ideas
as
human
agents
are
by
their
size
complexion
limbs
and
motions
and
thirdly
because
his
operations
are
regular
and
uniform
whenever
the
course
of
nature
is
interrupted
by
a
miracle
men
are
ready
to
own
the
presence
of
a
superior
agent
but
when
we
see
things
go
on
in
the
ordinary
course
they
do
not
excite
in
us
any
reflexion
their
order
and
concatenation
though
it
be
an
argument
of
the
greatest
wisdom
power
and
goodness
in
their
creator
is
yet
so
constant
and
familiar
to
us
that
we
do
not
think
them
the
immediate
effects
of
a
free
spirit
especially
since
inconsistency
and
mutability
in
acting
though
it
be
an
imperfection
is
looked
on
as
a
mark
of
freedom
tenth
tenthly
it
will
be
objected
that
the
notions
we
advance
are
inconsistent
with
several
sound
truths
in
philosophy
and
mathematics
for
example
the
motion
of
the
earth
is
now
universally
admitted
by
astronomers
as
a
truth
grounded
on
the
clearest
and
most
convincing
reasons
but
on
the
foregoing
principles
there
can
be
no
such
thing
for
motion
being
only
an
idea
it
follows
that
if
it
be
not
perceived
it
exists
not
but
the
motion
of
the
earth
is
not
perceived
by
sense
i
answer
that
tenet
if
rightly
understood
will
be
found
to
agree
with
the
principles
we
have
premised
for
the
question
whether
the
earth
moves
or
no
amounts
in
reality
to
no
more
than
this
to
wit
whether
we
have
reason
to
conclude
from
what
has
been
observed
by
astronomers
that
if
we
were
placed
in
such
and
such
circumstances
and
such
or
such
a
position
and
distance
both
from
the
earth
and
sun
we
should
perceive
the
former
to
move
among
the
choir
of
the
planets
and
appearing
in
all
respects
like
one
of
them
and
this
by
the
established
rules
of
nature
which
we
have
no
reason
to
mistrust
is
reasonably
collected
from
the
phenomena
we
may
from
the
experience
we
have
had
of
the
train
and
succession
of
ideas
in
our
minds
often
make
i
will
not
say
uncertain
conjectures
but
sure
and
well
grounded
predictions
concerning
the
ideas
we
shall
be
affected
with
pursuant
to
a
great
train
of
actions
and
be
enabled
to
pass
a
right
judgment
of
what
would
have
appeared
to
us
in
case
we
were
placed
in
circumstances
very
different
from
those
we
are
in
at
present
herein
consists
the
knowledge
of
nature
which
may
preserve
its
use
and
certainty
very
consistently
with
what
has
been
said
it
will
be
easy
to
apply
this
to
whatever
objections
of
the
like
sort
may
be
drawn
from
the
magnitude
of
the
stars
or
any
other
discoveries
in
astronomy
or
nature
eleventh
in
the
eleventh
place
it
will
be
demanded
to
what
purpose
serves
that
curious
organization
of
plants
and
the
animal
mechanism
in
the
parts
of
animals
might
not
vegetables
grow
and
shoot
forth
leaves
of
blossoms
and
animals
perform
all
their
motions
as
well
without
as
with
all
that
variety
of
internal
parts
so
elegantly
contrived
and
put
together
which
being
ideas
have
nothing
powerful
or
operative
in
them
nor
have
any
necessary
connexion
with
the
effects
ascribed
to
them
if
it
be
a
spirit
that
immediately
produces
every
effect
by
a
fiat
or
act
of
his
will
we
must
think
all
that
is
fine
and
artificial
in
the
works
whether
of
man
or
nature
to
be
made
in
vain
by
this
doctrine
though
an
artist
has
made
the
spring
and
wheels
and
every
movement
of
a
watch
and
adjusted
them
in
such
a
manner
as
he
knew
would
produce
the
motions
he
designed
yet
he
must
think
all
this
done
to
no
purpose
and
that
it
is
an
intelligence
which
directs
the
index
and
points
to
the
hour
of
the
day
if
so
why
may
not
the
intelligence
do
it
without
his
being
at
the
pains
of
making
the
movements
and
putting
them
together
why
does
not
an
empty
case
serve
as
well
as
another
and
how
comes
it
to
pass
that
whenever
there
is
any
fault
in
the
going
of
a
watch
there
is
some
corresponding
disorder
to
be
found
in
the
movements
which
being
mended
by
a
skilful
hand
all
is
right
again
the
like
may
be
said
of
all
the
clockwork
of
nature
great
part
whereof
is
so
wonderfully
fine
and
subtle
as
scarce
to
be
discerned
by
the
best
microscope
in
short
it
will
be
asked
how
upon
our
principles
any
tolerable
account
can
be
given
or
any
final
cause
assigned
of
an
innumerable
multitude
of
bodies
and
machines
framed
with
the
most
exquisite
art
which
in
the
common
philosophy
have
very
apposite
uses
assigned
them
and
serve
to
explain
abundance
of
phenomena
to
all
which
i
answer
first
that
though
there
were
some
difficulties
relating
to
the
administration
of
providence
and
the
uses
by
it
assigned
to
the
several
parts
of
nature
which
i
could
not
solve
by
the
foregoing
principles
yet
this
objection
could
be
of
small
weight
against
the
truth
and
certainty
of
those
things
which
may
be
proved
a
priori
with
the
utmost
evidence
and
rigor
of
demonstration
secondly
but
neither
are
the
received
principles
free
from
the
like
difficulties
for
it
may
still
be
demanded
to
what
end
god
should
take
those
roundabout
methods
of
effecting
things
by
instruments
and
machines
which
no
one
can
deny
might
have
been
effected
by
the
mere
command
of
his
will
without
all
that
apparatus
nay
if
we
narrowly
consider
it
we
shall
find
the
objection
may
be
retorted
with
greater
force
on
those
who
hold
the
existence
of
those
machines
without
of
mind
for
it
has
been
made
evident
that
solidity
bulk
figure
motion
and
the
like
have
no
activity
or
efficacy
in
them
so
as
to
be
capable
of
producing
any
one
effect
in
nature
see
sect
whoever
therefore
supposes
them
to
exist
allowing
the
supposition
possible
when
they
are
not
perceived
does
it
manifestly
to
no
purpose
since
the
only
use
that
is
assigned
to
them
as
they
exist
unperceived
is
that
they
produce
those
perceivable
effects
which
in
truth
can
not
be
ascribed
to
anything
but
spirit
fourthly
but
to
come
nigher
the
difficulty
it
must
be
observed
that
though
the
fabrication
of
all
those
parts
and
organs
be
not
absolutely
necessary
to
the
producing
any
effect
yet
it
is
necessary
to
the
producing
of
things
in
a
constant
regular
way
according
to
the
laws
of
nature
there
are
certain
general
laws
that
run
through
the
whole
chain
of
natural
effects
these
are
learned
by
the
observation
and
study
of
nature
and
are
by
men
applied
as
well
to
the
framing
artificial
things
for
the
use
and
ornament
of
life
as
to
the
explaining
various
phenomena
which
explication
consists
only
in
showing
the
conformity
any
particular
phenomenon
has
to
the
general
laws
of
nature
or
which
is
the
same
thing
in
discovering
the
uniformity
there
is
in
the
production
of
natural
effects
as
will
be
evident
to
whoever
shall
attend
to
the
several
instances
wherein
philosophers
pretend
to
account
for
appearances
that
there
is
a
great
and
conspicuous
use
in
these
regular
constant
methods
of
working
observed
by
the
supreme
agent
has
been
shown
in
sect
and
it
is
no
less
visible
that
a
particular
size
figure
motion
and
disposition
of
parts
are
necessary
though
not
absolutely
to
the
producing
any
effect
yet
to
the
producing
it
according
to
the
standing
mechanical
laws
of
nature
thus
for
instance
it
can
not
be
denied
that
god
or
the
intelligence
that
sustains
and
rules
the
ordinary
course
of
things
might
if
he
were
minded
to
produce
a
miracle
cause
all
the
motions
on
the
of
a
watch
though
nobody
had
ever
made
the
movements
and
put
them
in
it
but
yet
if
he
will
act
agreeably
to
the
rules
of
mechanism
by
him
for
wise
ends
established
and
maintained
in
the
creation
it
is
necessary
that
those
actions
of
the
watchmaker
whereby
he
makes
the
movements
and
rightly
adjusts
them
precede
the
production
of
the
aforesaid
motions
as
also
that
any
disorder
in
them
be
attended
with
the
perception
of
some
corresponding
disorder
in
the
movements
which
being
once
corrected
all
is
right
again
it
may
indeed
on
some
occasions
be
necessary
that
the
author
of
nature
display
his
overruling
power
in
producing
some
appearance
out
of
the
ordinary
series
of
things
such
exceptions
from
the
general
rules
of
nature
are
proper
to
surprise
and
awe
men
into
an
acknowledgement
of
the
divine
being
but
then
they
are
to
be
used
but
seldom
otherwise
there
is
a
plain
reason
why
they
should
fail
of
that
effect
besides
god
seems
to
choose
the
convincing
our
reason
of
his
attributes
by
the
works
of
nature
which
discover
so
much
harmony
and
contrivance
in
their
make
and
are
such
plain
indications
of
wisdom
and
beneficence
in
their
author
rather
than
to
astonish
us
into
a
belief
of
his
being
by
anomalous
and
surprising
events
to
set
this
matter
in
a
yet
clearer
light
i
shall
observe
that
what
has
been
objected
in
sect
amounts
in
reality
to
no
more
than
this
ideas
are
not
anyhow
and
at
random
produced
there
being
a
certain
order
and
connexion
between
them
like
to
that
of
cause
and
effect
there
are
also
several
combinations
of
them
made
in
a
very
regular
and
artificial
manner
which
seem
like
so
many
instruments
in
the
hand
of
nature
that
being
hid
as
it
were
behind
the
scenes
have
a
secret
operation
in
producing
those
appearances
which
are
seen
on
the
theatre
of
the
world
being
themselves
discernible
only
to
the
curious
eye
of
the
philosopher
but
since
one
idea
can
not
be
the
cause
of
another
to
what
purpose
is
that
connexion
and
since
those
instruments
being
barely
inefficacious
perceptions
in
the
mind
are
not
subservient
to
the
production
of
natural
effects
it
is
demanded
why
they
are
made
or
in
other
words
what
reason
can
be
assigned
why
god
should
make
us
upon
a
close
inspection
into
his
works
behold
so
great
variety
of
ideas
so
artfully
laid
together
and
so
much
according
to
rule
it
not
being
credible
that
he
would
be
at
the
expense
if
one
may
so
speak
of
all
that
art
and
regularity
to
no
purpose
to
all
which
my
answer
is
first
that
the
connexion
of
ideas
does
not
imply
the
relation
of
cause
and
effect
but
only
of
a
mark
or
sign
with
the
thing
signified
the
fire
which
i
see
is
not
the
cause
of
the
pain
i
suffer
upon
my
approaching
it
but
the
mark
that
forewarns
me
of
it
in
like
manner
the
noise
that
i
hear
is
not
the
effect
of
this
or
that
motion
or
collision
of
the
ambient
bodies
but
the
sign
thereof
secondly
the
reason
why
ideas
are
formed
into
machines
that
is
artificial
and
regular
combinations
is
the
same
with
that
for
combining
letters
into
words
that
a
few
original
ideas
may
be
made
to
signify
a
great
number
of
effects
and
actions
it
is
necessary
they
be
variously
combined
together
and
to
the
end
their
use
be
permanent
and
universal
these
combinations
must
be
made
by
rule
and
with
wise
contrivance
by
this
means
abundance
of
information
is
conveyed
unto
us
concerning
what
we
are
to
expect
from
such
and
such
actions
and
what
methods
are
proper
to
be
taken
for
the
exciting
such
and
such
ideas
which
in
effect
is
all
that
i
conceive
to
be
distinctly
meant
when
it
is
said
that
by
discerning
a
figure
texture
and
mechanism
of
the
inward
parts
of
bodies
whether
natural
or
artificial
we
may
attain
to
know
the
several
uses
and
properties
depending
thereon
or
the
nature
of
the
thing
proper
employment
of
the
natural
hence
it
is
evident
that
those
things
which
under
the
notion
of
a
cause
or
concurring
to
the
production
of
effects
are
altogether
inexplicable
and
run
us
into
great
absurdities
may
be
very
naturally
explained
and
have
a
proper
and
obvious
use
assigned
to
them
when
they
are
considered
only
as
marks
or
signs
for
our
information
and
it
is
the
searching
after
and
endeavouring
to
understand
those
signs
instituted
by
the
author
of
nature
that
ought
to
be
the
employment
of
the
natural
philosopher
and
not
the
pretending
to
explain
things
by
corporeal
causes
which
doctrine
seems
to
have
too
much
estranged
the
minds
of
men
from
that
active
principle
that
supreme
and
wise
spirit
in
whom
we
live
move
and
have
our
being
twelfth
in
the
twelfth
place
it
may
perhaps
be
objected
that
though
it
be
clear
from
what
has
been
said
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
an
inert
senseless
extended
solid
figured
movable
substance
existing
without
the
mind
such
as
philosophers
describe
matter
yet
if
any
man
shall
leave
out
of
his
idea
of
matter
the
positive
ideas
of
extension
figure
solidity
and
motion
and
say
that
he
means
only
by
that
word
an
inert
senseless
substance
that
exists
without
the
mind
or
unperceived
which
is
the
occasion
of
our
ideas
or
at
the
presence
whereof
god
is
pleased
to
excite
ideas
in
us
it
doth
not
appear
but
that
matter
taken
in
this
sense
may
possibly
exist
in
answer
to
which
i
say
first
that
it
seems
no
less
absurd
to
suppose
a
substance
without
accidents
than
it
is
to
suppose
accidents
without
a
substance
but
secondly
though
we
should
grant
this
unknown
substance
may
possibly
exist
yet
where
can
it
be
supposed
to
be
that
it
exists
not
in
the
mind
is
agreed
and
that
it
exists
not
in
place
is
no
less
certain
since
all
place
or
extension
exists
only
in
the
mind
as
has
been
already
proved
it
remains
therefore
that
it
exists
nowhere
at
all
matter
supports
nothing
an
argument
against
its
let
us
examine
a
little
the
description
that
is
here
given
us
of
matter
it
neither
acts
nor
perceives
nor
is
perceived
for
this
is
all
that
is
meant
by
saying
it
is
an
inert
senseless
unknown
substance
which
is
a
definition
entirely
made
up
of
negatives
excepting
only
the
relative
notion
of
its
standing
under
or
supporting
but
then
it
must
be
observed
that
it
supports
nothing
at
all
and
how
nearly
this
comes
to
the
description
of
a
nonentity
i
desire
may
be
considered
but
say
you
it
is
the
unknown
occasion
at
the
presence
of
which
ideas
are
excited
in
us
by
the
will
of
god
now
i
would
fain
know
how
anything
can
be
present
to
us
which
is
neither
perceivable
by
sense
nor
reflexion
nor
capable
of
producing
any
idea
in
our
minds
nor
is
at
all
extended
nor
has
any
form
nor
exists
in
any
place
the
words
to
be
present
when
thus
applied
must
needs
be
taken
in
some
abstract
and
strange
meaning
and
which
i
am
not
able
to
comprehend
again
let
us
examine
what
is
meant
by
occasion
so
far
as
i
can
gather
from
the
common
use
of
language
that
word
signifies
either
the
agent
which
produces
any
effect
or
else
something
that
is
observed
to
accompany
or
go
before
it
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
but
when
it
is
applied
to
matter
as
above
described
it
can
be
taken
in
neither
of
those
senses
for
matter
is
said
to
be
passive
and
inert
and
so
can
not
be
an
agent
or
efficient
cause
it
is
also
unperceivable
as
being
devoid
of
all
sensible
qualities
and
so
can
not
be
the
occasion
of
our
perceptions
in
the
latter
sense
as
when
the
burning
my
finger
is
said
to
be
the
occasion
of
the
pain
that
attends
it
what
therefore
can
be
meant
by
calling
matter
an
occasion
the
term
is
either
used
in
no
sense
at
all
or
else
in
some
very
distant
from
its
received
signification
you
will
perhaps
say
that
matter
though
it
be
not
perceived
by
us
is
nevertheless
perceived
by
god
to
whom
it
is
the
occasion
of
exciting
ideas
in
our
minds
for
say
you
since
we
observe
our
sensations
to
be
imprinted
in
an
orderly
and
constant
manner
it
is
but
reasonable
to
suppose
there
are
certain
constant
and
regular
occasions
of
their
being
produced
that
is
to
say
that
there
are
certain
permanent
and
distinct
parcels
of
matter
corresponding
to
our
ideas
which
though
they
do
not
excite
them
in
our
minds
or
anywise
immediately
affect
us
as
being
altogether
passive
and
unperceivable
to
us
they
are
nevertheless
to
god
by
whom
they
art
perceived
as
it
were
so
many
occasions
to
remind
him
when
and
what
ideas
to
imprint
on
our
minds
that
so
things
may
go
on
in
a
constant
uniform
manner
in
answer
to
this
i
observe
that
as
the
notion
of
matter
is
here
stated
the
question
is
no
longer
concerning
the
existence
of
a
thing
distinct
from
spirit
and
idea
from
perceiving
and
being
perceived
but
whether
there
are
not
certain
ideas
of
i
know
not
what
sort
in
the
mind
of
god
which
are
so
many
marks
or
notes
that
direct
him
how
to
produce
sensations
in
our
minds
in
a
constant
and
regular
method
much
after
the
same
manner
as
a
musician
is
directed
by
the
notes
of
music
to
produce
that
harmonious
train
and
composition
of
sound
which
is
called
a
tune
though
they
who
hear
the
music
do
not
perceive
the
notes
and
may
be
entirely
ignorant
of
them
but
this
notion
of
matter
seems
too
extravagant
to
deserve
a
confutation
besides
it
is
in
effect
no
objection
against
what
we
have
advanced
viz
that
there
is
no
senseless
unperceived
substance
the
order
of
our
perceptions
shows
the
goodness
of
god
but
affords
no
proof
of
the
existence
of
if
we
follow
the
light
of
reason
we
shall
from
the
constant
uniform
method
of
our
sensations
collect
the
goodness
and
wisdom
of
the
spirit
who
excites
them
in
our
minds
but
this
is
all
that
i
can
see
reasonably
concluded
from
thence
to
me
i
say
it
is
evident
that
the
being
of
a
spirit
infinitely
wise
good
and
powerful
is
abundantly
sufficient
to
explain
all
the
appearances
of
nature
but
as
for
inert
senseless
matter
nothing
that
i
perceive
has
any
the
least
connexion
with
it
or
leads
to
the
thoughts
of
it
and
i
would
fain
see
any
one
explain
any
the
meanest
phenomenon
in
nature
by
it
or
show
any
manner
of
reason
though
in
the
lowest
rank
of
probability
that
he
can
have
for
its
existence
or
even
make
any
tolerable
sense
or
meaning
of
that
supposition
for
as
to
its
being
an
occasion
we
have
i
think
evidently
shown
that
with
regard
to
us
it
is
no
occasion
it
remains
therefore
that
it
must
be
if
at
all
the
occasion
to
god
of
exciting
ideas
in
us
and
what
this
amounts
to
we
have
just
now
seen
it
is
worth
while
to
reflect
a
little
on
the
motives
which
induced
men
to
suppose
the
existence
of
material
substance
that
so
having
observed
the
gradual
ceasing
and
expiration
of
those
motives
or
reasons
we
may
proportionably
withdraw
the
assent
that
was
grounded
on
them
first
therefore
it
was
thought
that
colour
figure
motion
and
the
rest
of
the
sensible
qualities
or
accidents
did
really
exist
without
the
mind
and
for
this
reason
it
seemed
needful
to
suppose
some
unthinking
substratum
or
substance
wherein
they
did
exist
since
they
could
not
be
conceived
to
exist
by
themselves
afterwards
in
process
of
time
men
being
convinced
that
colours
sounds
and
the
rest
of
the
sensible
secondary
qualities
had
no
existence
without
the
mind
they
stripped
this
substratum
or
material
substance
of
those
qualities
leaving
only
the
primary
ones
figure
motion
and
suchlike
which
they
still
conceived
to
exist
without
the
mind
and
consequently
to
stand
in
need
of
a
material
support
but
it
having
been
shown
that
none
even
of
these
can
possibly
exist
otherwise
than
in
a
spirit
or
mind
which
perceives
them
it
follows
that
we
have
no
longer
any
reason
to
suppose
the
being
of
matter
nay
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
there
should
be
any
such
thing
so
long
as
that
word
is
taken
to
denote
an
unthinking
substratum
of
qualities
or
accidents
wherein
they
exist
without
the
mind
but
though
it
be
allowed
by
the
materialists
themselves
that
matter
was
thought
of
only
for
the
sake
of
supporting
accidents
and
the
reason
entirely
ceasing
one
might
expect
the
mind
should
naturally
and
without
any
reluctance
at
all
quit
the
belief
of
what
was
solely
grounded
thereon
yet
the
prejudice
is
riveted
so
deeply
in
our
thoughts
that
we
can
scarce
tell
how
to
part
with
it
and
are
therefore
inclined
since
the
thing
itself
is
indefensible
at
least
to
retain
the
name
which
we
apply
to
i
know
not
what
abstracted
and
indefinite
notions
of
being
or
occasion
though
without
any
show
of
reason
at
least
so
far
as
i
can
see
for
what
is
there
on
our
part
or
what
do
we
perceive
amongst
all
the
ideas
sensations
notions
which
are
imprinted
on
our
minds
either
by
sense
or
reflexion
from
whence
may
be
inferred
the
existence
of
an
inert
thoughtless
unperceived
occasion
and
on
the
other
hand
on
the
part
of
an
spirit
what
can
there
be
that
should
make
us
believe
or
even
suspect
he
is
directed
by
an
inert
occasion
to
excite
ideas
in
our
minds
absurdity
of
contending
for
the
existence
of
matter
as
the
occasion
of
it
is
a
very
extraordinary
instance
of
the
force
of
prejudice
and
much
to
be
lamented
that
the
mind
of
man
retains
so
great
a
fondness
against
all
the
evidence
of
reason
for
a
stupid
thoughtless
somewhat
by
the
interposition
whereof
it
would
as
it
were
screen
itself
from
the
providence
of
god
and
remove
it
farther
off
from
the
affairs
of
the
world
but
though
we
do
the
utmost
we
can
to
secure
the
belief
of
matter
though
when
reason
forsakes
us
we
endeavour
to
support
our
opinion
on
the
bare
possibility
of
the
thing
and
though
we
indulge
ourselves
in
the
full
scope
of
an
imagination
not
regulated
by
reason
to
make
out
that
poor
possibility
yet
the
upshot
of
all
is
that
there
are
certain
unknown
ideas
in
the
mind
of
god
for
this
if
anything
is
all
that
i
conceive
to
be
meant
by
occasion
with
regard
to
god
and
this
at
the
bottom
is
no
longer
contending
for
the
thing
but
for
the
name
whether
therefore
there
are
such
ideas
in
the
mind
of
god
and
whether
they
may
be
called
by
the
name
matter
i
shall
not
dispute
but
if
you
stick
to
the
notion
of
an
unthinking
substance
or
support
of
extension
motion
and
other
sensible
qualities
then
to
me
it
is
most
evidently
impossible
there
should
be
any
such
thing
since
it
is
a
plain
repugnancy
that
those
qualities
should
exist
in
or
be
supported
by
an
unperceiving
substance
that
a
substratum
not
perceived
may
exist
but
say
you
though
it
be
granted
that
there
is
no
thoughtless
support
of
extension
and
the
other
qualities
or
accidents
which
we
perceive
yet
there
may
perhaps
be
some
inert
unperceiving
substance
or
substratum
of
some
other
qualities
as
incomprehensible
to
us
as
colours
are
to
a
man
born
blind
because
we
have
not
a
sense
adapted
to
them
but
if
we
had
a
new
sense
we
should
possibly
no
more
doubt
of
their
existence
than
a
blind
man
made
to
see
does
of
the
existence
of
light
and
colours
i
answer
first
if
what
you
mean
by
the
word
matter
be
only
the
unknown
support
of
unknown
qualities
it
is
no
matter
whether
there
is
such
a
thing
or
no
since
it
no
way
concerns
us
and
i
do
not
see
the
advantage
there
is
in
disputing
about
what
we
know
not
what
and
we
know
not
why
but
secondly
if
we
had
a
new
sense
it
could
only
furnish
us
with
new
ideas
or
sensations
and
then
we
should
have
the
same
reason
against
their
existing
in
an
unperceiving
substance
that
has
been
already
offered
with
relation
to
figure
motion
colour
and
the
like
qualities
as
has
been
shown
are
nothing
else
but
sensations
or
ideas
which
exist
only
in
a
mind
perceiving
them
and
this
is
true
not
only
of
the
ideas
we
are
acquainted
with
at
present
but
likewise
of
all
possible
ideas
whatsoever
but
you
will
insist
what
if
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
the
existence
of
matter
what
if
i
can
not
assign
any
use
to
it
or
explain
anything
by
it
or
even
conceive
what
is
meant
by
that
word
yet
still
it
is
no
contradiction
to
say
that
matter
exists
and
that
this
matter
is
in
general
a
substance
or
occasion
of
ideas
though
indeed
to
go
about
to
unfold
the
meaning
or
adhere
to
any
particular
explication
of
those
words
may
be
attended
with
great
difficulties
i
answer
when
words
are
used
without
a
meaning
you
may
put
them
together
as
you
please
without
danger
of
running
into
a
contradiction
you
may
say
for
example
that
twice
two
is
equal
to
seven
so
long
as
you
declare
you
do
not
take
the
words
of
that
proposition
in
their
usual
acceptation
but
for
marks
of
you
know
not
what
and
by
the
same
reason
you
may
say
there
is
an
inert
thoughtless
substance
without
accidents
which
is
the
occasion
of
our
ideas
and
we
shall
understand
just
as
much
by
one
proposition
as
the
other
in
the
last
place
you
will
say
what
if
we
give
up
the
cause
of
material
substance
and
stand
to
it
that
matter
is
an
unknown
somewhat
neither
substance
nor
accident
spirit
nor
idea
inert
thoughtless
indivisible
immovable
unextended
existing
in
no
place
for
say
you
whatever
may
be
urged
against
substance
or
occasion
or
any
other
positive
or
relative
notion
of
matter
has
no
place
at
all
so
long
as
this
negative
definition
of
matter
is
adhered
to
i
answer
you
may
if
so
it
shall
seem
good
use
the
word
matter
in
the
same
sense
as
other
men
use
nothing
and
so
make
those
terms
convertible
in
your
style
for
after
all
this
is
what
appears
to
me
to
be
the
result
of
that
definition
the
parts
whereof
when
i
consider
with
attention
either
collectively
or
separate
from
each
other
i
do
not
find
that
there
is
any
kind
of
effect
or
impression
made
on
my
mind
different
from
what
is
excited
by
the
term
nothing
you
will
reply
perhaps
that
in
the
definition
is
included
what
doth
sufficiently
distinguish
it
from
nothing
the
positive
abstract
idea
of
quiddity
entity
or
existence
i
own
indeed
that
those
who
pretend
to
the
faculty
of
framing
abstract
general
ideas
do
talk
as
if
they
had
such
an
idea
which
is
say
they
the
most
abstract
and
general
notion
of
all
that
is
to
me
the
most
incomprehensible
of
all
others
that
there
are
a
great
variety
of
spirits
of
different
orders
and
capacities
whose
faculties
both
in
number
and
extent
are
far
exceeding
those
the
author
of
my
being
has
bestowed
on
me
i
see
no
reason
to
deny
and
for
me
to
pretend
to
determine
by
my
own
few
stinted
narrow
inlets
of
perception
what
ideas
the
inexhaustible
power
of
the
supreme
spirit
may
imprint
upon
them
were
certainly
the
utmost
folly
and
presumption
since
there
may
be
for
aught
that
i
know
innumerable
sorts
of
ideas
or
sensations
as
different
from
one
another
and
from
all
that
i
have
perceived
as
colours
are
from
sounds
but
how
ready
soever
i
may
be
to
acknowledge
the
scantiness
of
my
comprehension
with
regard
to
the
endless
variety
of
spirits
and
ideas
that
may
possibly
exist
yet
for
any
one
to
pretend
to
a
notion
of
entity
or
existence
abstracted
from
spirit
and
idea
from
perceived
and
being
perceived
is
i
suspect
a
downright
repugnancy
and
trifling
with
it
remains
that
we
consider
the
objections
which
may
possibly
be
made
on
the
part
of
religion
objections
derived
from
the
scriptures
some
there
are
who
think
that
though
the
arguments
for
the
real
existence
of
bodies
which
are
drawn
from
reason
be
allowed
not
to
amount
to
demonstration
yet
the
holy
scriptures
are
so
clear
in
the
point
as
will
sufficiently
convince
every
good
christian
that
bodies
do
really
exist
and
are
something
more
than
mere
ideas
there
being
in
holy
writ
innumerable
facts
related
which
evidently
suppose
the
reality
of
timber
and
stone
mountains
and
rivers
and
cities
and
human
bodies
to
which
i
answer
that
no
sort
of
writings
whatever
sacred
or
profane
which
use
those
and
the
like
words
in
the
vulgar
acceptation
or
so
as
to
have
a
meaning
in
them
are
in
danger
of
having
their
truth
called
in
question
by
our
doctrine
that
all
those
things
do
really
exist
that
there
are
bodies
even
corporeal
substances
when
taken
in
the
vulgar
sense
has
been
shown
to
be
agreeable
to
our
principles
and
the
difference
betwixt
things
and
ideas
realities
and
chimeras
has
been
distinctly
explained
see
sect
and
i
do
not
think
that
either
what
philosophers
call
matter
or
the
existence
of
objects
without
the
mind
is
anywhere
mentioned
in
scripture
no
objection
as
to
language
again
whether
there
can
be
or
be
not
external
things
it
is
agreed
on
all
hands
that
the
proper
use
of
words
is
the
marking
our
conceptions
or
things
only
as
they
are
known
and
perceived
by
us
whence
it
plainly
follows
that
in
the
tenets
we
have
laid
down
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
right
use
and
significancy
of
language
and
that
discourse
of
what
kind
soever
so
far
as
it
is
intelligible
remains
undisturbed
but
all
this
seems
so
manifest
from
what
has
been
largely
set
forth
in
the
premises
that
it
is
needless
to
insist
any
farther
on
it
but
secondly
it
will
be
urged
that
miracles
do
at
least
lose
much
of
their
stress
and
import
by
our
principles
what
must
we
think
of
rod
was
it
not
really
turned
into
a
serpent
or
was
there
only
a
change
of
ideas
in
the
minds
of
the
spectators
and
can
it
be
supposed
that
our
saviour
did
no
more
at
the
in
cana
than
impose
on
the
sight
and
smell
and
taste
of
the
guests
so
as
to
create
in
them
the
appearance
or
idea
only
of
wine
the
same
may
be
said
of
all
other
miracles
which
in
consequence
of
the
foregoing
principles
must
be
looked
upon
only
as
so
many
cheats
or
illusions
of
fancy
to
this
i
reply
that
the
rod
was
changed
into
a
real
serpent
and
the
water
into
real
wine
that
this
does
not
in
the
least
contradict
what
i
have
elsewhere
said
will
be
evident
from
sect
and
but
this
business
of
real
and
imaginary
has
been
already
so
plainly
and
fully
explained
and
so
often
referred
to
and
the
difficulties
about
it
are
so
easily
answered
from
what
has
gone
before
that
it
were
an
affront
to
the
reader
understanding
to
resume
the
explication
of
it
in
its
place
i
shall
only
observe
that
if
at
table
all
who
were
present
should
see
and
smell
and
taste
and
drink
wine
and
find
the
effects
of
it
with
me
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
its
reality
so
that
at
bottom
the
scruple
concerning
real
miracles
has
no
place
at
all
on
ours
but
only
on
the
received
principles
and
consequently
makes
rather
for
than
against
what
has
been
said
consequences
of
the
preceding
having
done
with
the
objections
which
i
endeavoured
to
propose
in
the
clearest
light
and
gave
them
all
the
force
and
weight
i
could
we
proceed
in
the
next
place
to
take
a
view
of
our
tenets
in
their
consequences
some
of
these
appear
at
first
sight
as
that
several
difficult
and
obscure
questions
on
which
abundance
of
speculation
has
been
thrown
away
are
entirely
banished
from
philosophy
whether
corporeal
substance
can
think
whether
matter
be
infinitely
divisible
and
how
it
operates
on
spirit
these
and
like
inquiries
have
given
infinite
amusement
to
philosophers
in
all
ages
but
depending
on
the
existence
of
matter
they
have
no
longer
any
place
on
our
principles
many
other
advantages
there
are
as
well
with
regard
to
religion
as
the
sciences
which
it
is
easy
for
any
one
to
deduce
from
what
has
been
premised
but
this
will
appear
more
plainly
in
the
sequel
the
removal
of
matter
gives
certainty
to
from
the
principles
we
have
laid
down
it
follows
human
knowledge
may
naturally
be
reduced
to
two
heads
that
of
ideas
and
that
of
spirits
of
each
of
these
i
shall
treat
in
order
and
first
as
to
ideas
or
unthinking
things
our
knowledge
of
these
has
been
very
much
obscured
and
confounded
and
we
have
been
led
into
very
dangerous
errors
by
supposing
a
twofold
existence
of
the
objects
of
sense
the
one
intelligible
or
in
the
mind
the
other
real
and
without
the
mind
whereby
unthinking
things
are
thought
to
have
a
natural
subsistence
of
their
own
distinct
from
being
perceived
by
spirits
this
which
if
i
mistake
not
has
been
shown
to
be
a
most
groundless
and
absurd
notion
is
the
very
root
of
scepticism
for
so
long
as
men
thought
that
real
things
subsisted
without
the
mind
and
that
their
knowledge
was
only
so
far
forth
real
as
it
was
conformable
to
real
things
it
follows
they
could
not
be
certain
they
had
any
real
knowledge
at
all
for
how
can
it
be
known
that
the
things
which
are
perceived
are
conformable
to
those
which
are
not
perceived
or
exist
without
the
mind
colour
figure
motion
extension
and
the
like
considered
only
as
so
many
sensations
in
the
mind
are
perfectly
known
there
being
nothing
in
them
which
is
not
perceived
but
if
they
are
looked
on
as
notes
or
images
referred
to
things
or
archetypes
existing
without
the
mind
then
are
we
involved
all
in
scepticism
we
see
only
the
appearances
and
not
the
real
qualities
of
things
what
may
be
the
extension
figure
or
motion
of
anything
really
and
absolutely
or
in
itself
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
know
but
only
the
proportion
or
relation
they
bear
to
our
senses
things
remaining
the
same
our
ideas
vary
and
which
of
them
or
even
whether
any
of
them
at
all
represent
the
true
quality
really
existing
in
the
thing
it
is
out
of
our
reach
to
determine
so
that
for
aught
we
know
all
we
see
hear
and
feel
may
be
only
phantom
and
vain
chimera
and
not
at
all
agree
with
the
real
things
existing
in
rerum
natura
all
this
scepticism
follows
from
our
supposing
a
difference
between
things
and
ideas
and
that
the
former
have
a
subsistence
without
the
mind
or
unperceived
it
were
easy
to
dilate
on
this
subject
and
show
how
the
arguments
urged
by
sceptics
in
all
ages
depend
on
the
supposition
of
external
objects
if
there
be
external
matter
neither
the
nature
nor
existence
of
things
can
be
so
long
as
we
attribute
a
real
existence
to
unthinking
things
distinct
from
their
being
perceived
it
is
not
only
impossible
for
us
to
know
with
evidence
the
nature
of
any
real
unthinking
being
but
even
that
it
exists
hence
it
is
that
we
see
philosophers
distrust
their
senses
and
doubt
of
the
existence
of
heaven
and
earth
of
everything
they
see
or
feel
even
of
their
own
bodies
and
after
all
their
labour
and
struggle
of
thought
they
are
forced
to
own
we
can
not
attain
to
any
or
demonstrative
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
sensible
things
but
all
this
doubtfulness
which
so
bewilders
and
confounds
the
mind
and
makes
philosophy
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
vanishes
if
we
annex
a
meaning
to
our
words
and
not
amuse
ourselves
with
the
terms
absolute
external
exist
and
signifying
we
know
not
what
i
can
as
well
doubt
of
my
own
being
as
of
the
being
of
those
things
which
i
actually
perceive
by
sense
it
being
a
manifest
contradiction
that
any
sensible
object
should
be
immediately
perceived
by
sight
or
touch
and
at
the
same
time
have
no
existence
in
nature
since
the
very
existence
of
an
unthinking
being
consists
in
being
perceived
of
thing
or
nothing
seems
of
more
importance
towards
erecting
a
firm
system
of
sound
and
real
knowledge
which
may
be
proof
against
the
assaults
of
scepticism
than
to
lay
the
beginning
in
a
distinct
explication
of
what
is
meant
by
thing
reality
existence
for
in
vain
shall
we
dispute
concerning
the
real
existence
of
things
or
pretend
to
any
knowledge
thereof
so
long
as
we
have
not
fixed
the
meaning
of
those
words
thing
or
being
is
the
most
general
name
of
all
it
comprehends
under
it
two
kinds
entirely
distinct
and
heterogeneous
and
which
have
nothing
common
but
the
name
viz
spirits
and
ideas
the
former
are
active
indivisible
substances
the
latter
are
inert
fleeting
dependent
beings
which
subsist
not
by
themselves
but
are
supported
by
or
exist
in
minds
or
spiritual
substances
we
comprehend
our
own
existence
by
inward
feeling
or
reflexion
and
that
of
other
spirits
by
reason
we
may
be
said
to
have
some
knowledge
or
notion
of
our
own
minds
of
spirits
and
active
beings
whereof
in
a
strict
sense
we
have
not
ideas
in
like
manner
we
know
and
have
a
notion
of
relations
between
things
or
ideas
which
relations
are
distinct
from
the
ideas
or
things
related
inasmuch
as
the
latter
may
be
perceived
by
us
without
our
perceiving
the
former
to
me
it
seems
that
ideas
spirits
and
relations
are
all
in
their
respective
kinds
the
object
of
human
knowledge
and
subject
of
discourse
and
that
the
term
idea
would
be
improperly
extended
to
signify
everything
we
know
or
have
any
notion
of
external
things
either
imprinted
by
or
perceived
by
some
other
ideas
imprinted
on
the
senses
are
real
things
or
do
really
exist
this
we
do
not
deny
but
we
deny
they
can
subsist
without
the
minds
which
perceive
them
or
that
they
are
resemblances
of
any
archetypes
existing
without
the
mind
since
the
very
being
of
a
sensation
or
idea
consists
in
being
perceived
and
an
idea
can
be
like
nothing
but
an
idea
again
the
things
perceived
by
sense
may
be
termed
external
with
regard
to
their
origin
in
that
they
are
not
generated
from
within
by
the
mind
itself
but
imprinted
by
a
spirit
distinct
from
that
which
perceives
them
sensible
objects
may
likewise
be
said
to
be
without
the
mind
in
another
sense
namely
when
they
exist
in
some
other
mind
thus
when
i
shut
my
eyes
the
things
i
saw
may
still
exist
but
it
must
be
in
another
mind
sensible
qualities
it
were
a
mistake
to
think
that
what
is
here
said
derogates
in
the
least
from
the
reality
of
things
it
is
acknowledged
on
the
received
principles
that
extension
motion
and
in
a
word
all
sensible
qualities
have
need
of
a
support
as
not
being
able
to
subsist
by
themselves
but
the
objects
perceived
by
sense
are
allowed
to
be
nothing
but
combinations
of
those
qualities
and
consequently
can
not
subsist
by
themselves
thus
far
it
is
agreed
on
all
hand
so
that
in
denying
the
things
perceived
by
sense
an
existence
independent
of
a
substance
of
support
wherein
they
may
exist
we
detract
nothing
from
the
received
opinion
of
their
reality
and
are
guilty
of
no
innovation
in
that
respect
all
the
difference
is
that
according
to
us
the
unthinking
beings
perceived
by
sense
have
no
existence
distinct
from
being
perceived
and
can
not
therefore
exist
in
any
other
substance
than
those
unextended
indivisible
substances
or
spirits
which
act
and
think
and
perceive
them
whereas
philosophers
vulgarly
hold
that
the
sensible
qualities
do
exist
in
an
inert
extended
unperceiving
substance
which
they
call
matter
to
which
they
attribute
a
natural
subsistence
exterior
to
all
thinking
beings
or
distinct
from
being
perceived
by
any
mind
whatsoever
even
the
eternal
mind
of
the
creator
wherein
they
suppose
only
ideas
of
the
corporeal
substances
created
by
him
if
indeed
they
allow
them
to
be
at
all
created
objections
of
atheists
for
as
we
have
shown
the
doctrine
of
matter
or
corporeal
substance
to
have
been
the
main
pillar
and
support
of
scepticism
so
likewise
upon
the
same
foundation
have
been
raised
all
the
impious
schemes
of
atheism
and
irreligion
nay
so
great
a
difficulty
has
it
been
thought
to
conceive
matter
produced
out
of
nothing
that
the
most
celebrated
among
the
ancient
philosophers
even
of
those
who
maintained
the
being
of
a
god
have
thought
matter
to
be
uncreated
and
with
him
how
great
a
friend
material
substance
has
been
to
atheists
in
all
ages
were
needless
to
relate
all
their
monstrous
systems
have
so
visible
and
necessary
a
dependence
on
it
that
when
this
is
once
removed
the
whole
fabric
can
not
choose
but
fall
to
the
ground
insomuch
that
it
is
no
longer
worth
while
to
bestow
a
particular
consideration
on
the
absurdities
of
every
wretched
sect
of
atheists
and
of
fatalists
that
impious
and
profane
persons
should
readily
fall
in
with
those
systems
which
favour
their
inclinations
by
deriding
immaterial
substance
and
supposing
the
soul
to
be
divisible
and
subject
to
corruption
as
the
body
which
exclude
all
freedom
intelligence
and
design
from
the
formation
of
things
and
instead
thereof
make
a
self
existent
stupid
unthinking
substance
the
root
and
origin
of
all
beings
that
they
should
hearken
to
those
who
deny
a
providence
or
inspection
of
a
superior
mind
over
the
affairs
of
the
world
attributing
the
whole
series
of
events
either
to
blind
chance
or
fatal
necessity
arising
from
the
impulse
of
one
body
or
another
all
this
is
very
natural
and
on
the
other
hand
when
men
of
better
principles
observe
the
enemies
of
religion
lay
so
great
a
stress
on
unthinking
matter
and
all
of
them
use
so
much
industry
and
artifice
to
reduce
everything
to
it
methinks
they
should
rejoice
to
see
them
deprived
of
their
grand
support
and
driven
from
that
only
fortress
without
which
your
epicureans
hobbists
and
the
like
have
not
even
the
shadow
of
a
pretence
but
become
the
most
cheap
and
easy
triumph
in
the
world
of
the
existence
of
matter
or
bodies
unperceived
has
not
only
been
the
main
support
of
atheists
and
fatalists
but
on
the
same
principle
doth
idolatry
likewise
in
all
its
various
forms
depend
did
men
but
consider
that
the
sun
moon
and
stars
and
every
other
object
of
the
senses
are
only
so
many
sensations
in
their
minds
which
have
no
other
existence
but
barely
being
perceived
doubtless
they
would
never
fall
down
and
worship
their
own
ideas
but
rather
address
their
homage
to
that
eternal
invisible
mind
which
produces
and
sustains
all
things
and
the
same
absurd
principle
by
mingling
itself
with
the
articles
of
our
faith
has
occasioned
no
small
difficulties
to
christians
for
example
about
the
resurrection
how
many
scruples
and
objections
have
been
raised
by
socinians
and
others
but
do
not
the
most
plausible
of
them
depend
on
the
supposition
that
a
body
is
denominated
the
same
with
regard
not
to
the
form
or
that
which
is
perceived
by
sense
but
the
material
substance
which
remains
the
same
under
several
forms
take
away
this
material
substance
about
the
identity
whereof
all
the
dispute
is
and
mean
by
body
what
every
plain
ordinary
person
means
by
that
word
to
wit
that
which
is
immediately
seen
and
felt
which
is
only
a
combination
of
sensible
qualities
or
ideas
and
then
their
most
unanswerable
objections
come
to
nothing
summary
of
the
consequences
of
expelling
matter
being
once
expelled
out
of
nature
drags
with
it
so
many
sceptical
and
impious
notions
such
an
incredible
number
of
disputes
and
puzzling
questions
which
have
been
thorns
in
the
sides
of
divines
as
well
as
philosophers
and
made
so
much
fruitless
work
for
mankind
that
if
the
arguments
we
have
produced
against
it
are
not
found
equal
to
demonstration
as
to
me
they
evidently
seem
yet
i
am
sure
all
friends
to
knowledge
peace
and
religion
have
reason
to
wish
they
were
beside
the
external
existence
of
the
objects
of
perception
another
great
source
of
errors
and
difficulties
with
regard
to
ideal
knowledge
is
the
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas
such
as
it
has
been
set
forth
in
the
introduction
the
plainest
things
in
the
world
those
we
are
most
intimately
acquainted
with
and
perfectly
know
when
they
are
considered
in
an
abstract
way
appear
strangely
difficult
and
incomprehensible
time
place
and
motion
taken
in
particular
or
concrete
are
what
everybody
knows
but
having
passed
through
the
hands
of
a
metaphysician
they
become
too
abstract
and
fine
to
be
apprehended
by
men
of
ordinary
sense
bid
your
servant
meet
you
at
such
a
time
in
such
a
place
and
he
shall
never
stay
to
deliberate
on
the
meaning
of
those
words
in
conceiving
that
particular
time
and
place
or
the
motion
by
which
he
is
to
get
thither
he
finds
not
the
least
difficulty
but
if
time
be
taken
exclusive
of
all
those
particular
actions
and
ideas
that
diversify
the
day
merely
for
the
continuation
of
existence
or
duration
in
abstract
then
it
will
perhaps
gravel
even
a
philosopher
to
comprehend
it
for
my
own
part
whenever
i
attempt
to
frame
a
simple
idea
of
time
abstracted
from
the
succession
of
ideas
in
my
mind
which
flows
uniformly
and
is
participated
by
all
beings
i
am
lost
and
embrangled
in
inextricable
difficulties
i
have
no
notion
of
it
at
all
only
i
hear
others
say
it
is
infinitely
divisible
and
speak
of
it
in
such
a
manner
as
leads
me
to
entertain
odd
thoughts
of
my
existence
since
that
doctrine
lays
one
under
an
absolute
necessity
of
thinking
either
that
he
passes
away
innumerable
ages
without
a
thought
or
else
that
he
is
annihilated
every
moment
of
his
life
both
which
seem
equally
absurd
time
therefore
being
nothing
abstracted
from
the
sucession
of
ideas
in
our
minds
it
follows
that
the
duration
of
any
finite
spirit
must
be
estimated
by
the
number
of
ideas
or
actions
succeeding
each
other
in
that
same
spirit
or
mind
hence
it
is
a
plain
consequence
that
the
soul
always
thinks
and
in
truth
whoever
shall
go
about
to
divide
in
his
thoughts
or
abstract
the
existence
of
a
spirit
from
its
cogitation
will
i
believe
find
it
no
easy
task
so
likewise
when
we
attempt
to
abstract
extension
and
motion
from
all
other
qualities
and
consider
them
by
themselves
we
presently
lose
sight
of
them
and
run
into
great
extravagances
all
which
depend
on
a
twofold
abstraction
first
it
is
supposed
that
extension
for
example
may
be
abstracted
from
all
other
sensible
qualities
and
secondly
that
the
entity
of
extension
may
be
abstracted
from
its
being
perceived
but
whoever
shall
reflect
and
take
care
to
understand
what
he
says
will
if
i
mistake
not
acknowledge
that
all
sensible
qualities
are
alike
sensations
and
alike
real
that
where
the
extension
is
there
is
the
colour
too
in
his
mind
and
that
their
archetypes
can
exist
only
in
some
other
mind
and
that
the
objects
of
sense
are
nothing
but
those
sensations
combined
blended
or
if
one
may
so
speak
concreted
together
none
of
all
which
can
be
supposed
to
exist
unperceived
what
it
is
for
a
man
to
be
happy
or
an
object
good
every
one
may
think
he
knows
but
to
frame
an
abstract
idea
of
happiness
prescinded
from
all
particular
pleasure
or
of
goodness
from
everything
that
is
good
this
is
what
few
can
pretend
to
so
likewise
a
man
may
be
just
and
virtuous
without
having
precise
ideas
of
justice
and
virtue
the
opinion
that
those
and
the
like
words
stand
for
general
notions
abstracted
from
all
particular
persons
and
actions
seems
to
have
rendered
morality
very
difficult
and
the
study
thereof
of
small
use
to
mankind
and
in
effect
the
doctrine
of
abstraction
has
not
a
little
contributed
towards
spoiling
the
most
useful
parts
of
knowledge
of
natural
philosophy
and
the
two
great
provinces
of
speculative
science
conversant
about
ideas
received
from
sense
are
natural
philosophy
and
mathematics
with
regard
to
each
of
these
i
shall
make
some
observations
and
first
i
shall
say
somewhat
of
natural
philosophy
on
this
subject
it
is
that
the
sceptics
triumph
all
that
stock
of
arguments
they
produce
to
depreciate
our
faculties
and
make
mankind
appear
ignorant
and
low
are
drawn
principally
from
this
head
namely
that
we
are
under
an
invincible
blindness
as
to
the
true
and
real
nature
of
things
this
they
exaggerate
and
love
to
enlarge
on
we
are
miserably
bantered
say
they
by
our
senses
and
amused
only
with
the
outside
and
show
of
things
the
real
essence
the
internal
qualities
and
constitution
of
every
the
meanest
object
is
hid
from
our
view
something
there
is
in
every
drop
of
water
every
grain
of
sand
which
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
human
understanding
to
fathom
or
comprehend
but
it
is
evident
from
what
has
been
shown
that
all
this
complaint
is
groundless
and
that
we
are
influenced
by
false
principles
to
that
degree
as
to
mistrust
our
senses
and
think
we
know
nothing
of
those
things
which
we
perfectly
comprehend
one
great
inducement
to
our
pronouncing
ourselves
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
things
is
the
current
opinion
that
everything
includes
within
itself
the
cause
of
its
properties
or
that
there
is
in
each
object
an
inward
essence
which
is
the
source
whence
its
discernible
qualities
flow
and
whereon
they
depend
some
have
pretended
to
account
for
appearances
by
occult
qualities
but
of
late
they
are
mostly
resolved
into
mechanical
causes
to
wit
the
figure
motion
weight
and
suchlike
qualities
of
insensible
particles
whereas
in
truth
there
is
no
other
agent
or
efficient
cause
than
spirit
it
being
evident
that
motion
as
well
as
all
other
ideas
is
perfectly
inert
see
sect
hence
to
endeavour
to
explain
the
production
of
colours
or
sounds
by
figure
motion
magnitude
and
the
like
must
needs
be
labour
in
vain
and
accordingly
we
see
the
attempts
of
that
kind
are
not
at
all
satisfactory
which
may
be
said
in
general
of
those
instances
wherein
one
idea
or
quality
is
assigned
for
the
cause
of
another
i
need
not
say
how
many
hypotheses
and
speculations
are
left
out
and
how
much
the
study
of
nature
is
abridged
by
this
doctrine
attraction
signifies
the
effect
not
the
manner
or
the
great
mechanical
principle
now
in
vogue
is
attraction
that
a
stone
falls
to
the
earth
or
the
sea
swells
towards
the
moon
may
to
some
appear
sufficiently
explained
thereby
but
how
are
we
enlightened
by
being
told
this
is
done
by
attraction
is
it
that
that
word
signifies
the
manner
of
the
tendency
and
that
it
is
by
the
mutual
drawing
of
bodies
instead
of
their
being
impelled
or
protruded
towards
each
other
but
nothing
is
determined
of
the
manner
or
action
and
it
may
as
truly
for
aught
we
know
be
termed
impulse
or
protrusion
as
attraction
again
the
parts
of
steel
we
see
cohere
firmly
together
and
this
also
is
accounted
for
by
attraction
but
in
this
as
in
the
other
instances
i
do
not
perceive
that
anything
is
signified
besides
the
effect
itself
for
as
to
the
manner
of
the
action
whereby
it
is
produced
or
the
cause
which
produces
it
these
are
not
so
much
as
aimed
at
indeed
if
we
take
a
view
of
the
several
phenomena
and
compare
them
together
we
may
observe
some
likeness
and
conformity
between
them
for
example
in
the
falling
of
a
stone
to
the
ground
in
the
rising
of
the
sea
towards
the
moon
in
cohesion
crystallization
etc
there
is
something
alike
namely
an
union
or
mutual
approach
of
bodies
so
that
any
one
of
these
or
the
like
phenomena
may
not
seem
strange
or
surprising
to
a
man
who
has
nicely
observed
and
compared
the
effects
of
nature
for
that
only
is
thought
so
which
is
uncommon
or
a
thing
by
itself
and
out
of
the
ordinary
course
of
our
observation
that
bodies
should
tend
towards
the
centre
of
the
earth
is
not
thought
strange
because
it
is
what
we
perceive
every
moment
of
our
lives
but
that
they
should
have
a
like
gravitation
towards
the
centre
of
the
moon
may
seem
odd
and
unaccountable
to
most
men
because
it
is
discerned
only
in
the
tides
but
a
philosopher
whose
thoughts
take
in
a
larger
compass
of
nature
having
observed
a
certain
similitude
of
appearances
as
well
in
the
heavens
as
the
earth
that
argue
innumerable
bodies
to
have
a
mutual
tendency
towards
each
other
which
he
denotes
by
the
general
name
attraction
whatever
can
be
reduced
to
that
he
thinks
justly
accounted
for
thus
he
explains
the
tides
by
the
attraction
of
the
terraqueous
globe
towards
the
moon
which
to
him
does
not
appear
odd
or
anomalous
but
only
a
particular
example
of
a
general
rule
or
law
of
nature
if
therefore
we
consider
the
difference
there
is
betwixt
natural
philosophers
and
other
men
with
regard
to
their
knowledge
of
the
phenomena
we
shall
find
it
consists
not
in
an
exacter
knowledge
of
the
efficient
cause
that
produces
them
for
that
can
be
no
other
than
the
will
of
a
spirit
but
only
in
a
greater
largeness
of
comprehension
whereby
analogies
harmonies
and
agreements
are
discovered
in
the
works
of
nature
and
the
particular
effects
explained
that
is
reduced
to
general
rules
see
sect
which
rules
grounded
on
the
analogy
and
uniformness
observed
in
the
production
of
natural
effects
are
most
agreeable
and
sought
after
by
the
mind
for
that
they
extend
our
prospect
beyond
what
is
present
and
near
to
us
and
enable
us
to
make
very
probable
conjectures
touching
things
that
may
have
happened
at
very
great
distances
of
time
and
place
as
well
as
to
predict
things
to
come
which
sort
of
endeavour
towards
omniscience
is
much
affected
by
the
mind
caution
as
to
the
use
of
but
we
should
proceed
warily
in
such
things
for
we
are
apt
to
lay
too
great
stress
on
analogies
and
to
the
prejudice
of
truth
humour
that
eagerness
of
the
mind
whereby
it
is
carried
to
extend
its
knowledge
into
general
theorems
for
example
in
the
business
of
gravitation
or
mutual
attraction
because
it
appears
in
many
instances
some
are
straightway
for
pronouncing
it
universal
and
that
to
attract
and
be
attracted
by
every
other
body
is
an
essential
quality
inherent
in
all
bodies
whatsoever
whereas
it
is
evident
the
fixed
stars
have
no
such
tendency
towards
each
other
and
so
far
is
that
gravitation
from
being
essential
to
bodies
that
in
some
instances
a
quite
contrary
principle
seems
to
show
itself
as
in
the
perpendicular
growth
of
plants
and
the
elasticity
of
the
air
there
is
nothing
necessary
or
essential
in
the
case
but
it
depends
entirely
on
the
will
of
the
governing
spirit
who
causes
certain
bodies
to
cleave
together
or
tend
towards
each
other
according
to
various
laws
whilst
he
keeps
others
at
a
fixed
distance
and
to
some
he
gives
a
quite
contrary
tendency
to
fly
asunder
just
as
he
sees
convenient
after
what
has
been
premised
i
think
we
may
lay
down
the
following
conclusions
first
it
is
plain
philosophers
amuse
themselves
in
vain
when
they
inquire
for
any
natural
efficient
cause
distinct
from
a
mind
or
spirit
secondly
considering
the
whole
creation
is
the
workmanship
of
a
wise
and
good
agent
it
should
seem
to
become
philosophers
to
employ
their
thoughts
contrary
to
what
some
hold
about
the
final
causes
of
things
and
i
confess
i
see
no
reason
why
pointing
out
the
various
ends
to
which
natural
things
are
adapted
and
for
which
they
were
originally
with
unspeakable
wisdom
contrived
should
not
be
thought
one
good
way
of
accounting
for
them
and
altogether
worthy
a
philosopher
thirdly
from
what
has
been
premised
no
reason
can
be
drawn
why
the
history
of
nature
should
not
still
be
studied
and
observations
and
experiments
made
which
that
they
are
of
use
to
mankind
and
enable
us
to
draw
any
general
conclusions
is
not
the
result
of
any
immutable
habitudes
or
relations
between
things
themselves
but
only
of
god
goodness
and
kindness
to
men
in
the
administration
of
the
world
see
sect
and
fourthly
by
a
diligent
observation
of
the
phenomena
within
our
view
we
may
discover
the
general
laws
of
nature
and
from
them
deduce
the
other
phenomena
i
do
not
say
demonstrate
for
all
deductions
of
that
kind
depend
on
a
supposition
that
the
author
of
nature
always
operates
uniformly
and
in
a
constant
observance
of
those
rules
we
take
for
principles
which
we
can
not
evidently
know
three
those
men
who
frame
general
rules
from
the
phenomena
and
afterwards
derive
the
phenomena
from
those
rules
seem
to
consider
signs
rather
than
causes
a
man
may
well
understand
natural
signs
without
knowing
their
analogy
or
being
able
to
say
by
what
rule
a
thing
is
so
or
so
and
as
it
is
very
possible
to
write
improperly
through
too
strict
an
observance
of
general
grammar
rules
so
in
arguing
from
general
laws
of
nature
it
is
not
impossible
we
may
extend
the
analogy
too
far
and
by
that
means
run
into
mistakes
as
in
reading
other
books
a
wise
man
will
choose
to
fix
his
thoughts
on
the
sense
and
apply
it
to
use
rather
than
lay
them
out
in
grammatical
remarks
on
the
language
so
in
perusing
the
volume
of
nature
it
seems
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
mind
to
affect
an
exactness
in
reducing
each
particular
phenomenon
to
general
rules
or
showing
how
it
follows
from
them
we
should
propose
to
ourselves
nobler
views
namely
to
recreate
and
exalt
the
mind
with
a
prospect
of
the
beauty
order
extent
and
variety
of
natural
things
hence
by
proper
inferences
to
enlarge
our
notions
of
the
grandeur
wisdom
and
beneficence
of
the
creator
and
lastly
to
make
the
several
parts
of
the
creation
so
far
as
in
us
lies
subservient
to
the
ends
they
were
designed
for
god
glory
and
the
sustentation
and
comfort
of
ourselves
and
the
best
key
for
the
aforesaid
analogy
or
natural
science
will
be
easily
acknowledged
to
be
a
certain
celebrated
treatise
of
mechanics
in
the
entrance
of
which
justly
admired
treatise
time
space
and
motion
are
distinguished
into
absolute
and
relative
true
and
apparent
mathematical
and
vulgar
which
distinction
as
it
is
at
large
explained
by
the
author
does
suppose
these
quantities
to
have
an
existence
without
the
mind
and
that
they
are
ordinarily
conceived
with
relation
to
sensible
things
to
which
nevertheless
in
their
own
nature
they
bear
no
relation
at
all
as
for
time
as
it
is
there
taken
in
an
absolute
or
abstracted
sense
for
the
duration
or
perseverance
of
the
existence
of
things
i
have
nothing
more
to
add
concerning
it
after
what
has
been
already
said
on
that
subject
sect
and
for
the
rest
this
celebrated
author
holds
there
is
an
absolute
space
which
being
unperceivable
to
sense
remains
in
itself
similar
and
immovable
and
relative
space
to
be
the
measure
thereof
which
being
movable
and
defined
by
its
situation
in
respect
of
sensible
bodies
is
vulgarly
taken
for
immovable
space
place
he
defines
to
be
that
part
of
space
which
is
occupied
by
any
body
and
according
as
the
space
is
absolute
or
relative
so
also
is
the
place
absolute
motion
is
said
to
be
the
translation
of
a
body
from
absolute
place
to
absolute
place
as
relative
motion
is
from
one
relative
place
to
another
and
because
the
parts
of
absolute
space
do
not
fall
under
our
senses
instead
of
them
we
are
obliged
to
use
their
sensible
measures
and
so
define
both
place
and
motion
with
respect
to
bodies
which
we
regard
as
immovable
but
it
is
said
in
philosophical
matters
we
must
abstract
from
our
senses
since
it
may
be
that
none
of
those
bodies
which
seem
to
be
quiescent
are
truly
so
and
the
same
thing
which
is
moved
relatively
may
be
really
at
rest
as
likewise
one
and
the
same
body
may
be
in
relative
rest
and
motion
or
even
moved
with
contrary
relative
motions
at
the
same
time
according
as
its
place
is
variously
defined
all
which
ambiguity
is
to
be
found
in
the
apparent
motions
but
not
at
all
in
the
true
or
absolute
which
should
therefore
be
alone
regarded
in
philosophy
and
the
true
as
we
are
told
are
distinguished
from
apparent
or
relative
motions
by
the
following
first
in
true
or
absolute
motion
all
parts
which
preserve
the
same
position
with
respect
of
the
whole
partake
of
the
motions
of
the
whole
secondly
the
place
being
moved
that
which
is
placed
therein
is
also
moved
so
that
a
body
moving
in
a
place
which
is
in
motion
doth
participate
the
motion
of
its
place
thirdly
true
motion
is
never
generated
or
changed
otherwise
than
by
force
impressed
on
the
body
itself
fourthly
true
motion
is
always
changed
by
force
impressed
on
the
body
moved
fifthly
in
circular
motion
barely
relative
there
is
no
centrifugal
force
which
nevertheless
in
that
which
is
true
or
absolute
is
proportional
to
the
quantity
of
motion
motion
whether
real
or
apparent
but
notwithstanding
what
has
been
said
i
must
confess
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
there
can
be
any
motion
other
than
relative
so
that
to
conceive
motion
there
must
be
at
least
conceived
two
bodies
whereof
the
distance
or
position
in
regard
to
each
other
is
varied
hence
if
there
was
one
only
body
in
being
it
could
not
possibly
be
moved
this
seems
evident
in
that
the
idea
i
have
of
motion
doth
necessarily
include
relation
apparent
motion
but
though
in
every
motion
it
be
necessary
to
conceive
more
bodies
than
one
yet
it
may
be
that
one
only
is
moved
namely
that
on
which
the
force
causing
the
change
in
the
distance
or
situation
of
the
bodies
is
impressed
for
however
some
may
define
relative
motion
so
as
to
term
that
body
moved
which
changes
its
distance
from
some
other
body
whether
the
force
or
action
causing
that
change
were
impressed
on
it
or
no
yet
as
relative
motion
is
that
which
is
perceived
by
sense
and
regarded
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
it
should
seem
that
every
man
of
common
sense
knows
what
it
is
as
well
as
the
best
philosopher
now
i
ask
any
one
whether
in
his
sense
of
motion
as
he
walks
along
the
streets
the
stones
he
passes
over
may
be
said
to
move
because
they
change
distance
with
his
feet
to
me
it
appears
that
though
motion
includes
a
relation
of
one
thing
to
another
yet
it
is
not
necessary
that
each
term
of
the
relation
be
denominated
from
it
as
a
man
may
think
of
somewhat
which
does
not
think
so
a
body
may
be
moved
to
or
from
another
body
which
is
not
therefore
itself
in
motion
as
the
place
happens
to
be
variously
defined
the
motion
which
is
related
to
it
varies
a
man
in
a
ship
may
be
said
to
be
quiescent
with
relation
to
the
sides
of
the
vessel
and
yet
move
with
relation
to
the
land
or
he
may
move
eastward
in
respect
of
the
one
and
westward
in
respect
of
the
other
in
the
common
affairs
of
life
men
never
go
beyond
the
earth
to
define
the
place
of
any
body
and
what
is
quiescent
in
respect
of
that
is
accounted
absolutely
to
be
so
but
philosophers
who
have
a
greater
extent
of
thought
and
juster
notions
of
the
system
of
things
discover
even
the
earth
itself
to
be
moved
in
order
therefore
to
fix
their
notions
they
seem
to
conceive
the
corporeal
world
as
finite
and
the
utmost
unmoved
walls
or
shell
thereof
to
be
the
place
whereby
they
estimate
true
motions
if
we
sound
our
own
conceptions
i
believe
we
may
find
all
the
absolute
motion
we
can
frame
an
idea
of
to
be
at
bottom
no
other
than
relative
motion
thus
defined
for
as
has
been
already
observed
absolute
motion
exclusive
of
all
external
relation
is
incomprehensible
and
to
this
kind
of
relative
motion
all
the
properties
causes
and
effects
ascribed
to
absolute
motion
will
if
i
mistake
not
be
found
to
agree
as
to
what
is
said
of
the
centrifugal
force
that
it
does
not
at
all
belong
to
circular
relative
motion
i
do
not
see
how
this
follows
from
the
experiment
which
is
brought
to
prove
it
see
philosophiae
naturalis
principia
mathematica
in
schol
def
viii
for
the
water
in
the
vessel
at
that
time
wherein
it
is
said
to
have
the
greatest
relative
circular
motion
has
i
think
no
motion
at
all
as
is
plain
from
the
foregoing
section
for
to
denominate
a
body
moved
it
is
requisite
first
that
it
change
its
distance
or
situation
with
regard
to
some
other
body
and
secondly
that
the
force
occasioning
that
change
be
applied
to
it
if
either
of
these
be
wanting
i
do
not
think
that
agreeably
to
the
sense
of
mankind
or
the
propriety
of
language
a
body
can
be
said
to
be
in
motion
i
grant
indeed
that
it
is
possible
for
us
to
think
a
body
which
we
see
change
its
distance
from
some
other
to
be
moved
though
it
have
no
force
applied
to
it
in
which
sense
there
may
be
apparent
motion
but
then
it
is
because
the
force
causing
the
change
of
distance
is
imagined
by
us
to
be
applied
or
impressed
on
that
body
thought
to
move
which
indeed
shows
we
are
capable
of
mistaking
a
thing
to
be
in
motion
which
is
not
and
that
is
all
any
idea
of
pure
space
from
what
has
been
said
it
follows
that
the
philosophic
consideration
of
motion
does
not
imply
the
being
of
an
absolute
space
distinct
from
that
which
is
perceived
by
sense
and
related
bodies
which
that
it
can
not
exist
without
the
mind
is
clear
upon
the
same
principles
that
demonstrate
the
like
of
all
other
objects
of
sense
and
perhaps
if
we
inquire
narrowly
we
shall
find
we
can
not
even
frame
an
idea
of
pure
space
exclusive
of
all
body
this
i
must
confess
seems
impossible
as
being
a
most
abstract
idea
when
i
excite
a
motion
in
some
part
of
my
body
if
it
be
free
or
without
resistance
i
say
there
is
space
but
if
i
find
a
resistance
then
i
say
there
is
body
and
in
proportion
as
the
resistance
to
motion
is
lesser
or
greater
i
say
the
space
is
more
or
less
pure
so
that
when
i
speak
of
pure
or
empty
space
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
word
space
stands
for
an
idea
distinct
from
or
conceivable
without
body
and
motion
though
indeed
we
are
apt
to
think
every
noun
substantive
stands
for
a
distinct
idea
that
may
be
separated
from
all
others
which
has
occasioned
infinite
mistakes
when
therefore
supposing
all
the
world
to
be
annihilated
besides
my
own
body
i
say
there
still
remains
pure
space
thereby
nothing
else
is
meant
but
only
that
i
conceive
it
possible
for
the
limbs
of
my
body
to
be
moved
on
all
sides
without
the
least
resistance
but
if
that
too
were
annihilated
then
there
could
be
no
motion
and
consequently
no
space
some
perhaps
may
think
the
sense
of
seeing
doth
furnish
them
with
the
idea
of
pure
space
but
it
is
plain
from
what
we
have
elsewhere
shown
that
the
ideas
of
space
and
distance
are
not
obtained
by
that
sense
see
the
essay
concerning
vision
what
is
here
laid
down
seems
to
put
an
end
to
all
those
disputes
and
difficulties
that
have
sprung
up
amongst
the
learned
concerning
the
nature
of
pure
space
but
the
chief
advantage
arising
from
it
is
that
we
are
freed
from
that
dangerous
dilemma
to
which
several
who
have
employed
their
thoughts
on
that
subject
imagine
themselves
reduced
to
wit
of
thinking
either
that
real
space
is
god
or
else
that
there
is
something
beside
god
which
is
eternal
uncreated
infinite
indivisible
immutable
both
which
may
justly
be
thought
pernicious
and
absurd
notions
it
is
certain
that
not
a
few
divines
as
well
as
philosophers
of
great
note
have
from
the
difficulty
they
found
in
conceiving
either
limits
or
annihilation
of
space
concluded
it
must
be
divine
and
some
of
late
have
set
themselves
particularly
to
show
the
incommunicable
attributes
of
god
agree
to
it
which
doctrine
how
unworthy
soever
it
may
seem
of
the
divine
nature
yet
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
get
clear
of
it
so
long
as
we
adhere
to
the
received
opinions
the
errors
arising
from
the
doctrines
of
abstraction
and
external
material
existences
influence
mathematical
hitherto
of
natural
philosophy
we
come
now
to
make
some
inquiry
concerning
that
other
great
branch
of
speculative
knowledge
to
wit
mathematics
these
how
celebrated
soever
they
may
be
for
their
clearness
and
certainty
of
demonstration
which
is
hardly
anywhere
else
to
be
found
can
not
nevertheless
be
supposed
altogether
free
from
mistakes
if
in
their
principles
there
lurks
some
secret
error
which
is
common
to
the
professors
of
those
sciences
with
the
rest
of
mankind
mathematicians
though
they
deduce
their
theorems
from
a
great
height
of
evidence
yet
their
first
principles
are
limited
by
the
consideration
of
quantity
and
they
do
not
ascend
into
any
inquiry
concerning
those
transcendental
maxims
which
influence
all
the
particular
sciences
each
part
whereof
mathematics
not
excepted
does
consequently
participate
of
the
errors
involved
in
them
that
the
principles
laid
down
by
mathematicians
are
true
and
their
way
of
deduction
from
those
principles
clear
and
incontestible
we
do
not
deny
but
we
hold
there
may
be
certain
erroneous
maxims
of
greater
extent
than
the
object
of
mathematics
and
for
that
reason
not
expressly
mentioned
though
tacitly
supposed
throughout
the
whole
progress
of
that
science
and
that
the
ill
effects
of
those
secret
unexamined
errors
are
diffused
through
all
the
branches
thereof
to
be
plain
we
suspect
the
mathematicians
are
as
well
as
other
men
concerned
in
the
errors
arising
from
the
doctrine
of
abstract
general
ideas
and
the
existence
of
objects
without
the
mind
arithmetic
has
been
thought
to
have
for
its
object
abstract
ideas
of
number
of
which
to
understand
the
properties
and
mutual
habitudes
is
supposed
no
mean
part
of
speculative
knowledge
the
opinion
of
the
pure
and
intellectual
nature
of
numbers
in
abstract
has
made
them
in
esteem
with
those
philosophers
who
seem
to
have
affected
an
uncommon
fineness
and
elevation
of
thought
it
has
set
a
price
on
the
most
trifling
numerical
speculations
which
in
practice
are
of
no
use
but
serve
only
for
amusement
and
has
therefore
so
far
infected
the
minds
of
some
that
they
have
dreamed
of
mighty
mysteries
involved
in
numbers
and
attempted
the
explication
of
natural
things
by
them
but
if
we
inquire
into
our
own
thoughts
and
consider
what
has
been
premised
we
may
perhaps
entertain
a
low
opinion
of
those
high
flights
and
abstractions
and
look
on
all
inquiries
about
numbers
only
as
so
many
difficiles
nugae
so
far
as
they
are
not
subservient
to
practice
and
promote
the
benefit
of
life
unity
in
abstract
we
have
before
considered
in
sect
from
which
and
what
has
been
said
in
the
introduction
it
plainly
follows
there
is
not
any
such
idea
but
number
being
defined
a
collection
of
units
we
may
conclude
that
if
there
be
no
such
thing
as
unity
or
unit
in
abstract
there
are
no
ideas
of
number
in
abstract
denoted
by
the
numeral
names
and
figures
the
theories
therefore
in
arithmetic
if
they
are
abstracted
from
the
names
and
figures
as
likewise
from
all
use
and
practice
as
well
as
from
the
particular
things
numbered
can
be
supposed
to
have
nothing
at
all
for
their
object
hence
we
may
see
how
entirely
the
science
of
numbers
is
subordinate
to
practice
and
how
jejune
and
trifling
it
becomes
when
considered
as
a
matter
of
mere
speculation
however
since
there
may
be
some
who
deluded
by
the
specious
show
of
discovering
abstracted
verities
waste
their
time
in
arithmetical
theorems
and
problems
which
have
not
any
use
it
will
not
be
amiss
if
we
more
fully
consider
and
expose
the
vanity
of
that
pretence
and
this
will
plainly
appear
by
taking
a
view
of
arithmetic
in
its
infancy
and
observing
what
it
was
that
originally
put
men
on
the
study
of
that
science
and
to
what
scope
they
directed
it
it
is
natural
to
think
that
at
first
men
for
ease
of
memory
and
help
of
computation
made
use
of
counters
or
in
writing
of
single
strokes
points
or
the
like
each
whereof
was
made
to
signify
an
unit
some
one
thing
of
whatever
kind
they
had
occasion
to
reckon
afterwards
they
found
out
the
more
compendious
ways
of
making
one
character
stand
in
place
of
several
strokes
or
points
and
lastly
the
notation
of
the
arabians
or
indians
came
into
use
wherein
by
the
repetition
of
a
few
characters
or
figures
and
varying
the
signification
of
each
figure
according
to
the
place
it
obtains
all
numbers
may
be
most
aptly
expressed
which
seems
to
have
been
done
in
imitation
of
language
so
that
an
exact
analogy
is
observed
betwixt
the
notation
by
figures
and
names
the
nine
simple
figures
answering
the
nine
first
numeral
names
and
places
in
the
former
corresponding
to
denominations
in
the
latter
and
agreeably
to
those
conditions
of
the
simple
and
local
value
of
figures
were
contrived
methods
of
finding
from
the
given
figures
or
marks
of
the
parts
what
figures
and
how
placed
are
proper
to
denote
the
whole
or
vice
versa
and
having
found
the
sought
figures
the
same
rule
or
analogy
being
observed
throughout
it
is
easy
to
read
them
into
words
and
so
the
number
becomes
perfectly
known
for
then
the
number
of
any
particular
things
is
said
to
be
known
when
we
know
the
name
of
figures
with
their
due
arrangement
that
according
to
the
standing
analogy
belong
to
them
for
these
signs
being
known
we
can
by
the
operations
of
arithmetic
know
the
signs
of
any
part
of
the
particular
sums
signified
by
them
and
thus
computing
in
signs
because
of
the
connexion
established
betwixt
them
and
the
distinct
multitudes
of
things
whereof
one
is
taken
for
an
unit
we
may
be
able
rightly
to
sum
up
divide
and
proportion
the
things
themselves
that
we
intend
to
number
in
arithmetic
therefore
we
regard
not
the
things
but
the
signs
which
nevertheless
are
not
regarded
for
their
own
sake
but
because
they
direct
us
how
to
act
with
relation
to
things
and
dispose
rightly
of
them
now
agreeably
to
what
we
have
before
observed
of
words
in
general
sect
introd
it
happens
here
likewise
that
abstract
ideas
are
thought
to
be
signified
by
numeral
names
or
characters
while
they
do
not
suggest
ideas
of
particular
things
to
our
minds
i
shall
not
at
present
enter
into
a
more
particular
dissertation
on
this
subject
but
only
observe
that
it
is
evident
from
what
has
been
said
those
things
which
pass
for
abstract
truths
and
theorems
concerning
numbers
are
in
reality
conversant
about
no
object
distinct
from
particular
numeral
things
except
only
names
and
characters
which
originally
came
to
be
considered
on
no
other
account
but
their
being
signs
or
capable
to
represent
aptly
whatever
particular
things
men
had
need
to
compute
whence
it
follows
that
to
study
them
for
their
own
sake
would
be
just
as
wise
and
to
as
good
purpose
as
if
a
man
neglecting
the
true
use
or
original
intention
and
subserviency
of
language
should
spend
his
time
in
impertinent
criticisms
upon
words
or
reasonings
and
controversies
purely
verbal
from
numbers
we
proceed
to
speak
of
extension
which
considered
as
relative
is
the
object
of
geometry
the
infinite
divisibility
of
finite
extension
though
it
is
not
expressly
laid
down
either
as
an
axiom
or
theorem
in
the
elements
of
that
science
yet
is
throughout
the
same
everywhere
supposed
and
thought
to
have
so
inseparable
and
essential
a
connexion
with
the
principles
and
demonstrations
in
geometry
that
mathematicians
never
admit
it
into
doubt
or
make
the
least
question
of
it
and
as
this
notion
is
the
source
from
whence
do
spring
all
those
amusing
geometrical
paradoxes
which
have
such
a
direct
repugnancy
to
the
plain
common
sense
of
mankind
and
are
admitted
with
so
much
reluctance
into
a
mind
not
yet
debauched
by
learning
so
it
is
the
principal
occasion
of
all
that
nice
and
extreme
subtilty
which
renders
the
study
of
mathematics
so
difficult
and
tedious
hence
if
we
can
make
it
appear
that
no
finite
extension
contains
innumerable
parts
or
is
infinitely
divisible
it
follows
that
we
shall
at
once
clear
the
science
of
geometry
from
a
great
number
of
difficulties
and
contradictions
which
have
ever
been
esteemed
a
reproach
to
human
reason
and
withal
make
the
attainment
thereof
a
business
of
much
less
time
and
pains
than
it
hitherto
has
been
every
particular
finite
extension
which
may
possibly
be
the
object
of
our
thought
is
an
idea
existing
only
in
the
mind
and
consequently
each
part
thereof
must
be
perceived
if
therefore
i
can
not
perceive
innumerable
parts
in
any
finite
extension
that
i
consider
it
is
certain
they
are
not
contained
in
it
but
it
is
evident
that
i
can
not
distinguish
innumerable
parts
in
any
particular
line
surface
or
solid
which
i
either
perceive
by
sense
or
figure
to
myself
in
my
mind
wherefore
i
conclude
they
are
not
contained
in
it
nothing
can
be
plainer
to
me
than
that
the
extensions
i
have
in
view
are
no
other
than
my
own
ideas
and
it
is
no
less
plain
that
i
can
not
resolve
any
one
of
my
ideas
into
an
infinite
number
of
other
ideas
that
is
that
they
are
not
infinitely
divisible
if
by
finite
extension
be
meant
something
distinct
from
a
finite
idea
i
declare
i
do
not
know
what
that
is
and
so
can
not
affirm
or
deny
anything
of
it
but
if
the
terms
extension
parts
are
taken
in
any
sense
conceivable
that
is
for
ideas
then
to
say
a
finite
quantity
or
extension
consists
of
parts
infinite
in
number
is
so
manifest
a
contradiction
that
every
one
at
first
sight
acknowledges
it
to
be
so
and
it
is
impossible
it
should
ever
gain
the
assent
of
any
reasonable
creature
who
is
not
brought
to
it
by
gentle
and
slow
degrees
as
a
converted
gentile
to
the
belief
of
transubstantiation
ancient
and
rooted
prejudices
do
often
pass
into
principles
and
those
propositions
which
once
obtain
the
force
and
credit
of
a
principle
are
not
only
themselves
but
likewise
whatever
is
deducible
from
them
thought
privileged
from
all
examination
and
there
is
no
absurdity
so
gross
which
by
this
means
the
mind
of
man
may
not
be
prepared
to
swallow
he
whose
understanding
is
possessed
with
the
doctrine
of
abstract
general
ideas
may
be
persuaded
that
whatever
be
thought
of
the
ideas
of
sense
extension
in
abstract
is
infinitely
divisible
and
one
who
thinks
the
objects
of
sense
exist
without
the
mind
will
perhaps
in
virtue
thereof
be
brought
to
admit
that
a
line
but
an
inch
long
may
contain
innumerable
parts
really
existing
though
too
small
to
be
discerned
these
errors
are
grafted
as
well
in
the
minds
of
geometricians
as
of
other
men
and
have
a
like
influence
on
their
reasonings
and
it
were
no
difficult
thing
to
show
how
the
arguments
from
geometry
made
use
of
to
support
the
infinite
divisibility
of
extension
are
bottomed
on
them
at
present
we
shall
only
observe
in
general
whence
it
is
the
mathematicians
are
all
so
fond
and
tenacious
of
that
doctrine
it
has
been
observed
in
another
place
that
the
theorems
and
demonstrations
in
geometry
are
conversant
about
universal
ideas
sect
introd
where
it
is
explained
in
what
sense
this
ought
to
be
understood
to
wit
the
particular
lines
and
figures
included
in
the
diagram
are
supposed
to
stand
for
innumerable
others
of
different
sizes
or
in
other
words
the
geometer
considers
them
abstracting
from
their
magnitude
which
does
not
imply
that
he
forms
an
abstract
idea
but
only
that
he
cares
not
what
the
particular
magnitude
is
whether
great
or
small
but
looks
on
that
as
a
thing
different
to
the
demonstration
hence
it
follows
that
a
line
in
the
scheme
but
an
inch
long
must
be
spoken
of
as
though
it
contained
ten
thousand
parts
since
it
is
regarded
not
in
itself
but
as
it
is
universal
and
it
is
universal
only
in
its
signification
whereby
it
represents
innumerable
lines
greater
than
itself
in
which
may
be
distinguished
ten
thousand
parts
or
more
though
there
may
not
be
above
an
inch
in
it
after
this
manner
the
properties
of
the
lines
signified
are
by
a
very
usual
figure
transferred
to
the
sign
and
thence
through
mistake
though
to
appertain
to
it
considered
in
its
own
nature
because
there
is
no
number
of
parts
so
great
but
it
is
possible
there
may
be
a
line
containing
more
the
is
said
to
contain
parts
more
than
any
assignable
number
which
is
true
not
of
the
inch
taken
absolutely
but
only
for
the
things
signified
by
it
but
men
not
retaining
that
distinction
in
their
thoughts
slide
into
a
belief
that
the
small
particular
line
described
on
paper
contains
in
itself
parts
innumerable
there
is
no
such
thing
as
the
ten
thousandth
part
of
an
inch
but
there
is
of
a
mile
or
diameter
of
the
earth
which
may
be
signified
by
that
inch
when
therefore
i
delineate
a
triangle
on
paper
and
take
one
side
not
above
an
inch
for
example
in
length
to
be
the
radius
this
i
consider
as
divided
into
or
parts
or
more
for
though
the
part
of
that
line
considered
in
itself
is
nothing
at
all
and
consequently
may
be
neglected
without
an
error
or
inconveniency
yet
these
described
lines
being
only
marks
standing
for
greater
quantities
whereof
it
may
be
the
ten
thousandth
part
is
very
considerable
it
follows
that
to
prevent
notable
errors
in
practice
the
radius
must
be
taken
of
parts
or
more
lines
which
are
infinitely
from
what
has
been
said
the
reason
is
plain
why
to
the
end
any
theorem
become
universal
in
its
use
it
is
necessary
we
speak
of
the
lines
described
on
paper
as
though
they
contained
parts
which
really
they
do
not
in
doing
of
which
if
we
examine
the
matter
thoroughly
we
shall
perhaps
discover
that
we
can
not
conceive
an
inch
itself
as
consisting
of
or
being
divisible
into
a
thousand
parts
but
only
some
other
line
which
is
far
greater
than
an
inch
and
represented
by
it
and
that
when
we
say
a
line
is
infinitely
divisible
we
must
mean
a
line
which
is
infinitely
great
what
we
have
here
observed
seems
to
be
the
chief
cause
why
to
suppose
the
infinite
divisibility
of
finite
extension
has
been
thought
necessary
in
geometry
the
several
absurdities
and
contradictions
which
flowed
from
this
false
principle
might
one
would
think
have
been
esteemed
so
many
demonstrations
against
it
but
by
i
know
not
what
logic
it
is
held
that
proofs
a
posteriori
are
not
to
be
admitted
against
propositions
relating
to
infinity
as
though
it
were
not
impossible
even
for
an
infinite
mind
to
reconcile
contradictions
or
as
if
anything
absurd
and
repugnant
could
have
a
necessary
connexion
with
truth
or
flow
from
it
but
whoever
considers
the
weakness
of
this
pretence
will
think
it
was
contrived
on
purpose
to
humour
the
laziness
of
the
mind
which
had
rather
acquiesce
in
an
indolent
scepticism
than
be
at
the
pains
to
go
through
with
a
severe
examination
of
those
principles
it
has
ever
embraced
for
true
of
late
the
speculations
about
infinities
have
run
so
high
and
grown
to
such
strange
notions
as
have
occasioned
no
small
scruples
and
disputes
among
the
geometers
of
the
present
age
some
there
are
of
great
note
who
not
content
with
holding
that
finite
lines
may
be
divided
into
an
infinite
number
of
parts
do
yet
farther
maintain
that
each
of
those
infinitesimals
is
itself
subdivisible
into
an
infinity
of
other
parts
or
infinitesimals
of
a
second
order
and
so
on
ad
infinitum
these
i
say
assert
there
are
infinitesimals
of
infinitesimals
of
infinitesimals
without
ever
coming
to
an
end
so
that
according
to
them
an
inch
does
not
barely
contain
an
infinite
number
of
parts
but
an
infinity
of
an
infinity
of
an
infinity
ad
infinitum
of
parts
others
there
be
who
hold
all
orders
of
infinitesimals
below
the
first
to
be
nothing
at
all
thinking
it
with
good
reason
absurd
to
imagine
there
is
any
positive
quantity
or
part
of
extension
which
though
multiplied
infinitely
can
never
equal
the
smallest
given
extension
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
no
less
absurd
to
think
the
square
cube
or
other
power
of
a
positive
real
root
should
itself
be
nothing
at
all
which
they
who
hold
infinitesimals
of
the
first
order
denying
all
of
the
subsequent
orders
are
obliged
to
maintain
objection
of
have
we
not
therefore
reason
to
conclude
they
are
both
in
the
wrong
and
that
there
is
in
effect
no
such
thing
as
parts
infinitely
small
or
an
infinite
number
of
parts
contained
in
any
finite
quantity
but
you
will
say
that
if
this
doctrine
obtains
it
will
follow
the
very
foundations
of
geometry
are
destroyed
and
those
great
men
who
have
raised
that
science
to
so
astonishing
a
height
have
been
all
the
while
building
a
castle
in
the
air
to
this
it
may
be
replied
that
whatever
is
useful
in
geometry
and
promotes
the
benefit
of
human
life
does
still
remain
firm
and
unshaken
on
our
principles
that
science
considered
as
practical
will
rather
receive
advantage
than
any
prejudice
from
what
has
been
said
but
to
set
this
in
a
due
light
may
be
the
proper
business
of
another
place
for
the
rest
though
it
should
follow
that
some
of
the
more
intricate
and
subtle
parts
of
speculative
mathematics
may
be
pared
off
without
any
prejudice
to
truth
yet
i
do
not
see
what
damage
will
be
thence
derived
to
mankind
on
the
contrary
i
think
it
were
highly
to
be
wished
that
men
of
great
abilities
and
obstinate
application
would
draw
off
their
thoughts
from
those
amusements
and
employ
them
in
the
study
of
such
things
as
lie
nearer
the
concerns
of
life
or
have
a
more
direct
influence
on
the
manners
second
objection
of
if
it
be
said
that
several
theorems
undoubtedly
true
are
discovered
by
methods
in
which
infinitesimals
are
made
use
of
which
could
never
have
been
if
their
existence
included
a
contradiction
in
it
i
answer
that
upon
a
thorough
examination
it
will
not
be
found
that
in
any
instance
it
is
necessary
to
make
use
of
or
conceive
infinitesimal
parts
of
finite
lines
or
even
quantities
less
than
the
minimum
sensible
nay
it
will
be
evident
this
is
never
done
it
being
impossible
if
the
doctrine
were
only
an
hypothesis
it
should
be
respected
for
its
by
what
we
have
premised
it
is
plain
that
very
numerous
and
important
errors
have
taken
their
rise
from
those
false
principles
which
were
impugned
in
the
foregoing
parts
of
this
treatise
and
the
opposites
of
those
erroneous
tenets
at
the
same
time
appear
to
be
most
fruitful
principles
from
whence
do
flow
innumerable
consequences
highly
advantageous
to
true
philosophy
as
well
as
to
religion
particularly
matter
or
the
absolute
existence
of
corporeal
objects
has
been
shown
to
be
that
wherein
the
most
avowed
and
pernicious
enemies
of
all
knowledge
whether
human
or
divine
have
ever
placed
their
chief
strength
and
confidence
and
surely
if
by
distinguishing
the
real
existence
of
unthinking
things
from
their
being
perceived
and
allowing
them
a
subsistance
of
their
own
out
of
the
minds
of
spirits
no
one
thing
is
explained
in
nature
but
on
the
contrary
a
great
many
inexplicable
difficulties
arise
if
the
supposition
of
matter
is
barely
precarious
as
not
being
grounded
on
so
much
as
one
single
reason
if
its
consequences
can
not
endure
the
light
of
examination
and
free
inquiry
but
screen
themselves
under
the
dark
and
general
pretence
of
infinites
being
incomprehensible
if
withal
the
removal
of
this
matter
be
not
attended
with
the
least
evil
consequence
if
it
be
not
even
missed
in
the
world
but
everything
as
well
nay
much
easier
conceived
without
it
if
lastly
both
sceptics
and
atheists
are
for
ever
silenced
upon
supposing
only
spirits
and
ideas
and
this
scheme
of
things
is
perfectly
agreeable
both
to
reason
and
religion
methinks
we
may
expect
it
should
be
admitted
and
firmly
embraced
though
it
were
proposed
only
as
an
hypothesis
and
the
existence
of
matter
had
been
allowed
possible
which
yet
i
think
we
have
evidently
demonstrated
that
it
is
not
true
it
is
that
in
consequence
of
the
foregoing
principles
several
disputes
and
speculations
which
are
esteemed
no
mean
parts
of
learning
are
rejected
as
useless
but
how
great
a
prejudice
soever
against
our
notions
this
may
give
to
those
who
have
already
been
deeply
engaged
and
make
large
advances
in
studies
of
that
nature
yet
by
others
we
hope
it
will
not
be
thought
any
just
ground
of
dislike
to
the
principles
and
tenets
herein
laid
down
that
they
abridge
the
labour
of
study
and
make
human
sciences
far
more
clear
compendious
and
attainable
than
they
were
before
having
despatched
what
we
intended
to
say
concerning
the
knowledge
of
ideas
the
method
we
proposed
leads
us
in
the
next
place
to
treat
of
spirits
with
regard
to
which
perhaps
human
knowledge
is
not
so
deficient
as
is
vulgarly
imagined
the
great
reason
that
is
assigned
for
our
being
thought
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
spirits
is
our
not
having
an
idea
of
it
but
surely
it
ought
not
to
be
looked
on
as
a
defect
in
a
human
understanding
that
it
does
not
perceive
the
idea
of
spirit
if
it
is
manifestly
impossible
there
should
be
any
such
idea
and
this
if
i
mistake
not
has
been
demonstrated
in
section
to
which
i
shall
here
add
that
a
spirit
has
been
shown
to
be
the
only
substance
or
support
wherein
unthinking
beings
or
ideas
can
exist
but
that
this
substance
which
supports
or
perceives
ideas
should
itself
be
an
idea
or
like
an
idea
is
evidently
absurd
it
will
perhaps
be
said
that
we
want
a
sense
as
some
have
imagined
proper
to
know
substances
withal
which
if
we
had
we
might
know
our
own
soul
as
we
do
a
triangle
to
this
i
answer
that
in
case
we
had
a
new
sense
bestowed
upon
us
we
could
only
receive
thereby
some
new
sensations
or
ideas
of
sense
but
i
believe
nobody
will
say
that
what
he
means
by
the
terms
soul
and
substance
is
only
some
particular
sort
of
idea
or
sensation
we
may
therefore
infer
that
all
things
duly
considered
it
is
not
more
reasonable
to
think
our
faculties
defective
in
that
they
do
not
furnish
us
with
an
idea
of
spirit
or
active
thinking
substance
than
it
would
be
if
we
should
blame
them
for
not
being
able
to
comprehend
a
round
square
from
the
opinion
that
spirits
are
to
be
known
after
the
manner
of
an
idea
or
sensation
have
risen
many
absurd
and
heterodox
tenets
and
much
scepticism
about
the
nature
of
the
soul
it
is
even
probable
that
this
opinion
may
have
produced
a
doubt
in
some
whether
they
had
any
soul
at
all
distinct
from
their
body
since
upon
inquiry
they
could
not
find
they
had
an
idea
of
it
that
an
idea
which
is
inactive
and
the
existence
whereof
consists
in
being
perceived
should
be
the
image
or
likeness
of
an
agent
subsisting
by
itself
seems
to
need
no
other
refutation
than
barely
attending
to
what
is
meant
by
those
words
but
perhaps
you
will
say
that
though
an
idea
can
not
resemble
a
spirit
in
its
thinking
acting
or
subsisting
by
itself
yet
it
may
in
some
other
respects
and
it
is
not
necessary
that
an
idea
or
image
be
in
all
respects
like
the
original
i
answer
if
it
does
not
in
those
mentioned
it
is
impossible
it
should
represent
it
in
any
other
thing
do
but
leave
out
the
power
of
willing
thinking
and
perceiving
ideas
and
there
remains
nothing
else
wherein
the
idea
can
be
like
a
spirit
for
by
the
word
spirit
we
mean
only
that
which
thinks
wills
and
perceives
this
and
this
alone
constitutes
the
signification
of
the
term
if
therefore
it
is
impossible
that
any
degree
of
those
powers
should
be
represented
in
an
idea
it
is
evident
there
can
be
no
idea
of
a
spirit
but
it
will
be
objected
that
if
there
is
no
idea
signified
by
the
terms
soul
spirit
and
substance
they
are
wholly
insignificant
or
have
no
meaning
in
them
i
answer
those
words
do
mean
or
signify
a
real
thing
which
is
neither
an
idea
nor
like
an
idea
but
that
which
perceives
ideas
and
wills
and
reasons
about
them
what
i
am
myself
that
which
i
denote
by
the
term
i
is
the
same
with
what
is
meant
by
soul
or
spiritual
substance
if
it
be
said
that
this
is
only
quarreling
at
a
word
and
that
since
the
immediately
significations
of
other
names
are
by
common
consent
called
ideas
no
reason
can
be
assigned
why
that
which
is
signified
by
the
name
spirit
or
soul
may
not
partake
in
the
same
appellation
i
answer
all
the
unthinking
objects
of
the
mind
agree
in
that
they
are
entirely
passive
and
their
existence
consists
only
in
being
perceived
whereas
a
soul
or
spirit
is
an
active
being
whose
existence
consists
not
in
being
perceived
but
in
perceiving
ideas
and
thinking
it
is
therefore
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
equivocation
and
confounding
natures
perfectly
disagreeing
and
unlike
that
we
distinguish
between
spirit
and
idea
see
sect
our
idea
of
in
a
large
sense
indeed
we
may
be
said
to
have
an
idea
or
rather
a
notion
of
spirit
that
is
we
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
otherwise
we
could
not
affirm
or
deny
anything
of
it
moreover
as
we
conceive
the
ideas
that
are
in
the
minds
of
other
spirits
by
means
of
our
own
which
we
suppose
to
be
resemblances
of
them
so
we
know
other
spirits
by
means
of
our
own
soul
which
in
that
sense
is
the
image
or
idea
of
them
it
having
a
like
respect
to
other
spirits
that
blueness
or
heat
by
me
perceived
has
to
those
ideas
perceived
by
another
the
natural
immortality
of
the
soul
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
foregoing
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
they
who
assert
the
natural
immortality
of
the
soul
are
of
opinion
that
it
is
absolutely
incapable
of
annihilation
even
by
the
infinite
power
of
the
creator
who
first
gave
it
being
but
only
that
it
is
not
liable
to
be
broken
or
dissolved
by
the
ordinary
laws
of
nature
or
motion
they
indeed
who
hold
the
soul
of
man
to
be
only
a
thin
vital
flame
or
system
of
animal
spirits
make
it
perishing
and
corruptible
as
the
body
since
there
is
nothing
more
easily
dissipated
than
such
a
being
which
it
is
naturally
impossible
should
survive
the
ruin
of
the
tabernacle
wherein
it
is
enclosed
and
this
notion
has
been
greedily
embraced
and
cherished
by
the
worst
part
of
mankind
as
the
most
effectual
antidote
against
all
impressions
of
virtue
and
religion
but
it
has
been
made
evident
that
bodies
of
what
frame
or
texture
soever
are
barely
passive
ideas
in
the
mind
which
is
more
distant
and
heterogeneous
from
them
than
light
is
from
darkness
we
have
shown
that
the
soul
is
indivisible
incorporeal
unextended
and
it
is
consequently
incorruptible
nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
the
motions
changes
decays
and
dissolutions
which
we
hourly
see
befall
natural
bodies
and
which
is
what
we
mean
by
the
course
of
nature
can
not
possibly
affect
an
active
simple
uncompounded
substance
such
a
being
therefore
is
indissoluble
by
the
force
of
nature
that
is
to
say
the
soul
of
man
is
naturally
immortal
after
what
has
been
said
it
is
i
suppose
plain
that
our
souls
are
not
to
be
known
in
the
same
manner
as
senseless
inactive
objects
or
by
way
of
idea
spirits
and
ideas
are
things
so
wholly
different
that
when
we
say
they
exist
they
are
known
or
the
like
these
words
must
not
be
thought
to
signify
anything
common
to
both
natures
there
is
nothing
alike
or
common
in
them
and
to
expect
that
by
any
multiplication
or
enlargement
of
our
faculties
we
may
be
enabled
to
know
a
spirit
as
we
do
a
triangle
seems
as
absurd
as
if
we
should
hope
to
see
a
sound
this
is
inculcated
because
i
imagine
it
may
be
of
moment
towards
clearing
several
important
questions
and
preventing
some
very
dangerous
errors
concerning
the
nature
of
the
soul
we
may
not
i
think
strictly
be
said
to
have
an
idea
of
an
active
being
or
of
an
action
although
we
may
be
said
to
have
a
notion
of
them
i
have
some
knowledge
or
notion
of
my
mind
and
its
acts
about
ideas
inasmuch
as
i
know
or
understand
what
is
meant
by
these
words
what
i
know
that
i
have
some
notion
of
i
will
not
say
that
the
terms
idea
and
notion
may
not
be
used
convertibly
if
the
world
will
have
it
so
but
yet
it
conduceth
to
clearness
and
propriety
that
we
distinguish
things
very
different
by
different
names
it
is
also
to
be
remarked
that
all
relations
including
an
act
of
the
mind
we
can
not
so
properly
be
said
to
have
an
idea
but
rather
a
notion
of
the
relations
and
habitudes
between
things
but
if
in
the
modern
way
the
word
idea
is
extended
to
spirits
and
relations
and
acts
this
is
after
all
an
affair
of
verbal
concern
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
add
that
the
doctrine
of
abstract
ideas
has
had
no
small
share
in
rendering
those
sciences
intricate
and
obscure
which
are
particularly
conversant
about
spiritual
things
men
have
imagined
they
could
frame
abstract
notions
of
the
powers
and
acts
of
the
mind
and
consider
them
prescinded
as
well
from
the
mind
or
spirit
itself
as
from
their
respective
objects
and
effects
hence
a
great
number
of
dark
and
ambiguous
terms
presumed
to
stand
for
abstract
notions
have
been
introduced
into
metaphysics
and
morality
and
from
these
have
grown
infinite
distractions
and
disputes
amongst
the
learned
but
nothing
seems
more
to
have
contributed
towards
engaging
men
in
controversies
and
mistakes
with
regard
to
the
nature
and
operations
of
the
mind
than
the
being
used
to
speak
of
those
things
in
terms
borrowed
from
sensible
ideas
for
example
the
will
is
termed
the
motion
of
the
soul
this
infuses
a
belief
that
the
mind
of
man
is
as
a
ball
in
motion
impelled
and
determined
by
the
objects
of
sense
as
necessarily
as
that
is
by
the
stroke
of
a
racket
hence
arise
endless
scruples
and
errors
of
dangerous
consequence
in
morality
all
which
i
doubt
not
may
be
cleared
and
truth
appear
plain
uniform
and
consistent
could
but
philosophers
be
prevailed
on
to
retire
into
themselves
and
attentively
consider
their
own
meaning
knowledge
of
spirits
not
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
plain
that
we
can
not
know
the
existence
of
other
spirits
otherwise
than
by
their
operations
or
the
ideas
by
them
excited
in
us
i
perceive
several
motions
changes
and
combinations
of
ideas
that
inform
me
there
are
certain
particular
agents
like
myself
which
accompany
them
and
concur
in
their
production
hence
the
knowledge
i
have
of
other
spirits
is
not
immediate
as
is
the
knowledge
of
my
ideas
but
depending
on
the
intervention
of
ideas
by
me
referred
to
agents
or
spirits
distinct
from
myself
as
effects
or
concomitant
signs
but
though
there
be
some
things
which
convince
us
human
agents
are
concerned
in
producing
them
yet
it
is
evident
to
every
one
that
those
things
which
are
called
the
works
of
nature
that
is
the
far
greater
part
of
the
ideas
or
sensations
perceived
by
us
are
not
produced
by
or
dependent
on
the
wills
of
men
there
is
therefore
some
other
spirit
that
causes
them
since
it
is
repugnant
that
they
should
subsist
by
themselves
see
sect
but
if
we
attentively
consider
the
constant
regularity
order
and
concatenation
of
natural
things
the
surprising
magnificence
beauty
and
perfection
of
the
larger
and
the
exquisite
contrivance
of
the
smaller
parts
of
creation
together
with
the
exact
harmony
and
correspondence
of
the
whole
but
above
all
the
laws
of
pain
and
pleasure
and
the
instincts
or
natural
inclinations
appetites
and
passions
of
animals
i
say
if
we
consider
all
these
things
and
at
the
same
time
attend
to
the
meaning
and
import
of
the
attributes
one
eternal
infinitely
wise
good
and
perfect
we
shall
clearly
perceive
that
they
belong
to
the
aforesaid
spirit
who
works
all
in
all
and
by
whom
all
things
consist
the
existence
of
god
more
evident
than
that
of
hence
it
is
evident
that
god
is
known
as
certainly
and
immediately
as
any
other
mind
or
spirit
whatsoever
distinct
from
ourselves
we
may
even
assert
that
the
existence
of
god
is
far
more
evidently
perceived
than
the
existence
of
men
because
the
effects
of
nature
are
infinitely
more
numerous
and
considerable
than
those
ascribed
to
human
agents
there
is
not
any
one
mark
that
denotes
a
man
or
effect
produced
by
him
which
does
not
more
strongly
evince
the
being
of
that
spirit
who
is
the
author
of
nature
for
it
is
evident
that
in
affecting
other
persons
the
will
of
man
has
no
other
object
than
barely
the
motion
of
the
limbs
of
his
body
but
that
such
a
motion
should
be
attended
by
or
excite
any
idea
in
the
mind
of
another
depends
wholly
on
the
will
of
the
creator
he
alone
it
is
who
upholding
all
things
by
the
word
of
his
power
maintains
that
intercourse
between
spirits
whereby
they
are
able
to
perceive
the
existence
of
each
other
and
yet
this
pure
and
clear
light
which
enlightens
every
one
is
itself
invisible
it
seems
to
be
a
general
pretence
of
the
unthinking
herd
that
they
can
not
see
god
could
we
but
see
him
say
they
as
we
see
a
man
we
should
believe
that
he
is
and
believing
obey
his
commands
but
alas
we
need
only
open
our
eyes
to
see
the
sovereign
lord
of
all
things
with
a
more
full
and
clear
view
than
we
do
any
one
of
our
fellow
creatures
not
that
i
imagine
we
see
god
as
some
will
have
it
by
a
direct
and
immediate
view
or
see
corporeal
things
not
by
themselves
but
by
seeing
that
which
represents
them
in
the
essence
of
god
which
doctrine
is
i
must
confess
to
me
incomprehensible
but
i
shall
explain
my
meaning
a
human
spirit
or
person
is
not
perceived
by
sense
as
not
being
an
idea
when
therefore
we
see
the
colour
size
figure
and
motions
of
a
man
we
perceive
only
certain
sensations
or
ideas
excited
in
our
own
minds
and
these
being
exhibited
to
our
view
in
sundry
distinct
collections
serve
to
mark
out
unto
us
the
existence
of
finite
and
created
spirits
like
ourselves
hence
it
is
plain
we
do
not
see
a
man
if
by
man
is
meant
that
which
lives
moves
perceives
and
thinks
as
we
do
but
only
such
a
certain
collection
of
ideas
as
directs
us
to
think
there
is
a
distinct
principle
of
thought
and
motion
like
to
ourselves
accompanying
and
represented
by
it
and
after
the
same
manner
we
see
god
all
the
difference
is
that
whereas
some
one
finite
and
narrow
assemblage
of
ideas
denotes
a
particular
human
mind
whithersoever
we
direct
our
view
we
do
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
perceive
manifest
tokens
of
the
divinity
everything
we
see
hear
feel
or
anywise
perceive
by
sense
being
a
sign
or
effect
of
the
power
of
god
as
is
our
perception
of
those
very
motions
which
are
produced
by
men
it
is
therefore
plain
that
nothing
can
be
more
evident
to
any
one
that
is
capable
of
the
least
reflexion
than
the
existence
of
god
or
a
spirit
who
is
intimately
present
to
our
minds
producing
in
them
all
that
variety
of
ideas
or
sensations
which
continually
affect
us
on
whom
we
have
an
absolute
and
entire
dependence
in
short
in
whom
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
that
the
discovery
of
this
great
truth
which
lies
so
near
and
obvious
to
the
mind
should
be
attained
to
by
the
reason
of
so
very
few
is
a
sad
instance
of
the
stupidity
and
inattention
of
men
who
though
they
are
surrounded
with
such
clear
manifestations
of
the
deity
are
yet
so
little
affected
by
them
that
they
seem
as
it
were
blinded
with
excess
of
light
objection
on
behalf
of
but
you
will
say
has
nature
no
share
in
the
production
of
natural
things
and
must
they
be
all
ascribed
to
the
immediate
and
sole
operation
of
god
i
answer
if
by
nature
is
meant
only
the
visible
series
of
effects
or
sensations
imprinted
on
our
minds
according
to
certain
fixed
and
general
laws
then
it
is
plain
that
nature
taken
in
this
sense
can
not
produce
anything
at
all
but
if
by
nature
is
meant
some
being
distinct
from
god
as
well
as
from
the
laws
of
nature
and
things
perceived
by
sense
i
must
confess
that
word
is
to
me
an
empty
sound
without
any
intelligible
meaning
annexed
to
it
nature
in
this
acceptation
is
a
vain
chimera
introduced
by
those
heathens
who
had
not
just
notions
of
the
omnipresence
and
infinite
perfection
of
god
but
it
is
more
unaccountable
that
it
should
be
received
among
christians
professing
belief
in
the
holy
scriptures
which
constantly
ascribe
those
effects
to
the
immediate
hand
of
god
that
heathen
philosophers
are
wont
to
impute
to
nature
the
lord
he
causeth
the
vapours
to
ascend
he
maketh
lightnings
with
rain
he
bringeth
forth
the
wind
out
of
his
treasures
jerem
he
turneth
the
shadow
of
death
into
the
morning
and
maketh
the
day
dark
with
night
amos
he
visiteth
the
earth
and
maketh
it
soft
with
showers
he
blesseth
the
springing
thereof
and
crowneth
the
year
with
his
goodness
so
that
the
pastures
are
clothed
with
flocks
and
the
valleys
are
covered
over
with
corn
see
psalm
but
notwithstanding
that
this
is
the
constant
language
of
scripture
yet
we
have
i
know
not
what
aversion
from
believing
that
god
concerns
himself
so
nearly
in
our
affairs
fain
would
we
suppose
him
at
a
great
distance
off
and
substitute
some
blind
unthinking
deputy
in
his
stead
though
if
we
may
believe
saint
paul
he
be
not
far
from
every
one
of
us
objection
to
the
hand
of
god
being
the
immediate
cause
it
will
i
doubt
not
be
objected
that
the
slow
and
gradual
methods
observed
in
the
production
of
natural
things
do
not
seem
to
have
for
their
cause
the
immediate
hand
of
an
almighty
agent
besides
monsters
untimely
births
fruits
blasted
in
the
blossom
rains
falling
in
desert
places
miseries
incident
to
human
life
and
the
like
are
so
many
arguments
that
the
whole
frame
of
nature
is
not
immediately
actuated
and
superintended
by
a
spirit
of
infinite
wisdom
and
goodness
but
the
answer
to
this
objection
is
in
a
good
measure
plain
from
sect
it
being
visible
that
the
aforesaid
methods
of
nature
are
absolutely
necessary
in
order
to
working
by
the
most
simple
and
general
rules
and
after
a
steady
and
consistent
manner
which
argues
both
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
god
such
is
the
artificial
contrivance
of
this
mighty
machine
of
nature
that
whilst
its
motions
and
various
phenomena
strike
on
our
senses
the
hand
which
actuates
the
whole
is
itself
unperceivable
to
men
of
flesh
and
blood
verily
saith
the
prophet
thou
art
a
god
that
hidest
thyself
isaiah
but
though
the
lord
conceal
himself
from
the
eyes
of
the
sensual
and
lazy
who
will
not
be
at
the
least
expense
of
thought
yet
to
an
unbiased
and
attentive
mind
nothing
can
be
more
plainly
legible
than
the
intimate
presence
of
an
spirit
who
fashions
regulates
and
sustains
the
whole
system
of
beings
it
is
clear
from
what
we
have
elsewhere
observed
that
the
operating
according
to
general
and
stated
laws
is
so
necessary
for
our
guidance
in
the
affairs
of
life
and
letting
us
into
the
secret
of
nature
that
without
it
all
reach
and
compass
of
thought
all
human
sagacity
and
design
could
serve
to
no
manner
of
purpose
it
were
even
impossible
there
should
be
any
such
faculties
or
powers
in
the
mind
see
sect
which
one
consideration
abundantly
outbalances
whatever
particular
inconveniences
may
thence
arise
we
should
further
consider
that
the
very
blemishes
and
defects
of
nature
are
not
without
their
use
in
that
they
make
an
agreeable
sort
of
variety
and
augment
the
beauty
of
the
rest
of
the
creation
as
shades
in
a
picture
serve
to
set
off
the
brighter
and
more
enlightened
parts
we
would
likewise
do
well
to
examine
whether
our
taxing
the
waste
of
seeds
and
embryos
and
accidental
destruction
of
plants
and
animals
before
they
come
to
full
maturity
as
an
imprudence
in
the
author
of
nature
be
not
the
effect
of
prejudice
contracted
by
our
familiarity
with
impotent
and
saving
mortals
in
man
indeed
a
thrifty
management
of
those
things
which
he
can
not
procure
without
much
pains
and
industry
may
be
esteemed
wisdom
but
we
must
not
imagine
that
the
inexplicably
fine
machine
of
an
animal
or
vegetable
costs
the
great
creator
any
more
pains
or
trouble
in
its
production
than
a
pebble
does
nothing
being
more
evident
than
that
an
omnipotent
spirit
can
indifferently
produce
everything
by
a
mere
fiat
or
act
of
his
will
hence
it
is
plain
that
the
splendid
profusion
of
natural
things
should
not
be
interpreted
weakness
or
prodigality
in
the
agent
who
produces
them
but
rather
be
looked
on
as
an
argument
of
the
riches
of
his
power
as
for
the
mixture
of
pain
or
uneasiness
which
is
in
the
world
pursuant
to
the
general
laws
of
nature
and
the
actions
of
finite
imperfect
spirits
this
in
the
state
we
are
in
at
present
is
indispensably
necessary
to
our
but
our
prospects
are
too
narrow
we
take
for
instance
the
idea
of
some
one
particular
pain
into
our
thoughts
and
account
it
evil
whereas
if
we
enlarge
our
view
so
as
to
comprehend
the
various
ends
connexions
and
dependencies
of
things
on
what
occasions
and
in
what
proportions
we
are
affected
with
pain
and
pleasure
the
nature
of
human
freedom
and
the
design
with
which
we
are
put
into
the
world
we
shall
be
forced
to
acknowledge
that
those
particular
things
which
considered
in
themselves
appear
to
be
evil
have
the
nature
of
good
when
considered
as
linked
with
the
whole
system
of
beings
atheism
and
manicheism
would
have
few
supporters
if
mankind
were
in
general
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
be
manifest
to
any
considering
person
that
it
is
merely
for
want
of
attention
and
comprehensiveness
of
mind
that
there
are
any
favourers
of
atheism
or
the
manichean
heresy
to
be
found
little
and
unreflecting
souls
may
indeed
burlesque
the
works
of
providence
the
beauty
and
order
whereof
they
have
not
capacity
or
will
not
be
at
the
pains
to
comprehend
but
those
who
are
masters
of
any
justness
and
extent
of
thought
and
are
withal
used
to
reflect
can
never
sufficiently
admire
the
divine
traces
of
wisdom
and
goodness
that
shine
throughout
the
economy
of
nature
but
what
truth
is
there
which
shineth
so
strongly
on
the
mind
that
by
an
aversion
of
thought
a
wilful
shutting
of
the
eyes
we
may
not
escape
seeing
it
is
it
therefore
to
be
wondered
at
if
the
generality
of
men
who
are
ever
intent
on
business
or
pleasure
and
little
used
to
fix
or
open
the
eye
of
their
mind
should
not
have
all
that
conviction
and
evidence
of
the
being
of
god
which
might
be
expected
in
reasonable
creatures
we
should
rather
wonder
that
men
can
be
found
so
stupid
as
to
neglect
than
that
neglecting
they
should
be
unconvinced
of
such
an
evident
and
momentous
truth
and
yet
it
is
to
be
feared
that
too
many
of
parts
and
leisure
who
live
in
christian
countries
are
merely
through
a
supine
and
dreadful
negligence
sunk
into
atheism
since
it
is
downright
impossible
that
a
soul
pierced
and
enlightened
with
a
thorough
sense
of
the
omnipresence
holiness
and
justice
of
that
almighty
spirit
should
persist
in
a
remorseless
violation
of
his
laws
we
ought
therefore
earnestly
to
meditate
and
dwell
on
those
important
points
that
so
we
may
attain
conviction
without
all
scruple
that
the
eyes
of
the
lord
are
in
every
place
beholding
the
evil
and
the
good
that
he
is
with
us
and
keepeth
us
in
all
places
whither
we
go
and
giveth
us
bread
to
eat
and
raiment
to
put
on
that
he
is
present
and
conscious
to
our
innermost
thoughts
and
that
we
have
a
most
absolute
and
immediate
dependence
on
him
a
clear
view
of
which
great
truths
can
not
choose
but
fill
our
hearts
with
an
awful
circumspection
and
holy
fear
which
is
the
strongest
incentive
to
virtue
and
the
best
guard
against
vice
for
after
all
what
deserves
the
first
place
in
our
studies
is
the
consideration
of
god
and
our
duty
which
to
promote
as
it
was
the
main
drift
and
design
of
my
labours
so
shall
i
esteem
them
altogether
useless
and
ineffectual
if
by
what
i
have
said
i
can
not
inspire
my
readers
with
a
pious
sense
of
the
presence
of
god
and
having
shown
the
falseness
or
vanity
of
those
barren
speculations
which
make
the
chief
employment
of
learned
men
the
better
dispose
them
to
reverence
and
embrace
the
salutary
truths
of
the
gospel
which
to
know
and
to
practice
is
the
highest
perfection
of
human
nature
