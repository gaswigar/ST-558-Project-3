nothing

but
blot
in
the
the
moon
rode
high
but
ominous
clouds
were
rushing
towards
it
clouds
heavy
with
snow
i
watched
these
clouds
as
i
drove
recklessly
desperately
over
the
winter
roads
i
had
just
missed
the
desire
of
my
life
the
one
precious
treasure
which
i
coveted
with
my
whole
undisciplined
heart
and
not
being
what
you
call
a
man
of
i
was
chafed
by
my
defeat
far
beyond
the
bounds
i
have
usually
set
for
myself
the
moon
with
the
wild
skurry
of
clouds
hastening
to
blot
it
out
of
sight
seemed
to
mirror
the
chaos
threatening
my
better
impulses
and
idly
keeping
it
in
view
i
rode
on
hardly
conscious
of
my
course
till
the
rapid
recurrence
of
several
landmarks
warned
me
that
i
had
taken
the
longest
route
home
and
that
in
another
moment
i
should
be
skirting
the
grounds
of
the
whispering
pines
our
country
clubhouse
had
taken
let
me
rather
say
my
horse
for
he
and
i
had
traversed
this
road
many
times
together
and
he
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
the
season
was
over
and
the
closed
i
did
not
think
of
it
myself
at
the
moment
and
was
recklessly
questioning
whether
i
should
not
drive
in
and
end
my
disappointment
in
a
wild
carouse
when
the
great
stack
of
chimneys
coming
suddenly
into
view
against
the
broad
disk
of
the
still
unclouded
moon
i
perceived
a
thin
trail
of
smoke
soaring
up
from
their
midst
and
realised
with
a
shock
that
there
should
be
no
such
sign
of
life
in
a
house
i
myself
had
closed
locked
and
barred
that
very
day
i
was
the
president
of
the
club
and
felt
responsible
pausing
only
long
enough
to
make
sure
that
i
had
yielded
to
no
delusion
and
that
fire
of
some
kind
was
burning
on
one
of
the
deserted
hearths
i
turned
in
at
the
lower
gateway
for
reasons
which
i
need
not
now
state
there
were
no
bells
attached
to
my
cutter
and
consequently
my
approach
was
noiseless
i
was
careful
that
it
should
be
so
also
careful
to
stop
short
of
the
front
door
and
leave
my
horse
and
sleigh
in
the
black
depths
of
the
pressing
up
to
the
walls
on
either
side
i
was
sure
that
all
was
not
as
it
should
be
inside
these
walls
but
as
god
lives
i
had
no
idea
what
was
amiss
or
how
deeply
my
own
destiny
was
involved
in
the
step
i
was
about
to
take
our
stands
as
it
may
be
necessary
to
remind
you
on
a
knoll
thickly
wooded
with
the
ancient
trees
i
have
mentioned
these
trees
all
pines
and
of
a
growth
unusual
and
of
an
aspect
hoary
extend
only
to
the
rear
end
of
the
house
where
a
wide
stretch
of
gently
undulating
ground
opens
at
once
upon
the
eye
suggesting
to
all
lovers
of
golf
the
admirable
use
to
which
it
is
put
from
early
spring
to
latest
fall
now
links
as
well
as
parterres
and
driveways
are
lying
under
an
even
blanket
of
winter
snow
and
even
the
building
with
its
picturesque
gables
and
rows
of
windows
is
indistinguishable
in
the
shadows
cast
by
the
heavy
pines
which
soar
above
it
and
twist
their
limbs
over
its
roof
and
about
its
forsaken
corners
with
a
moan
and
a
whisper
always
desolate
to
the
sensitive
ear
but
from
this
night
on
simply
appalling
no
other
building
stood
within
a
in
any
direction
it
was
veritably
a
country
club
gay
and
full
of
life
in
the
season
but
isolated
and
lonesome
beyond
description
after
winter
had
set
in
and
buried
flower
and
leaf
under
a
wide
waste
of
untrodden
snow
i
felt
this
isolation
as
i
stepped
from
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
prepared
to
cross
the
few
feet
of
open
space
leading
to
the
main
door
the
sudden
darkness
instantly
enveloping
me
as
the
clouds
whose
advancing
mass
i
had
been
watching
made
their
final
rush
upon
the
moon
added
its
physical
shock
to
this
inner
sense
of
desolation
and
in
some
moods
i
should
have
paused
and
thought
twice
before
attempting
the
door
behind
which
lurked
the
unknown
with
its
naturally
accompanying
suggestion
of
peril
but
rage
and
disappointment
working
hotly
within
me
had
left
no
space
for
fear
rather
rejoicing
in
the
doubtfulness
of
the
adventure
i
pushed
my
way
over
the
snow
until
my
feet
struck
the
steps
here
instinct
caused
me
to
stop
and
glance
quickly
up
and
down
the
building
either
way
not
a
gleam
of
light
met
my
eye
from
the
smallest
scintillating
pane
was
the
house
as
soundless
as
it
was
dark
i
listened
but
heard
nothing
i
listened
again
and
still
heard
nothing
then
i
proceeded
boldly
up
the
steps
and
laid
my
hand
on
the
door
it
was
unlatched
and
yielded
to
my
touch
light
or
no
light
sound
or
no
sound
there
was
some
one
within
the
fire
which
had
sent
its
attenuated
streak
of
smoke
up
into
the
moonlit
air
was
burning
yet
on
one
of
the
many
hearths
within
and
before
it
i
should
presently
see
whom
what
the
question
scarcely
interested
me
nevertheless
i
proceeded
to
enter
and
close
the
door
carefully
behind
me
as
i
did
so
i
cast
an
involuntary
glance
without
the
sky
was
inky
and
a
few
wandering
flakes
of
the
now
rapidly
advancing
storm
came
whirling
in
biting
my
cheeks
and
stinging
my
forehead
once
inside
i
stopped
short
possibly
to
listen
again
possibly
to
assure
myself
as
to
what
i
had
best
do
next
the
silence
was
profound
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
great
empty
building
my
own
footfall
as
i
stirred
seemed
to
wake
extraordinary
echoes
i
had
moved
but
a
few
steps
yet
to
my
heightened
senses
the
noise
seemed
loud
enough
to
wake
the
dead
instinctively
i
stopped
and
stood
there
was
no
answering
cessation
of
movement
darkness
silence
everywhere
yet
not
quite
absolute
darkness
as
my
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
place
i
found
it
possible
to
discern
the
outlines
of
the
windows
and
locate
the
stairs
and
the
arches
where
the
side
halls
opened
i
was
even
able
to
pick
out
the
exact
spot
where
the
great
antlers
spread
themselves
above
the
hatrack
and
presently
the
rack
itself
came
into
view
with
its
row
of
empty
pegs
yesterday
so
full
quite
empty
that
rack
interested
me
i
hardly
knew
why
and
regardless
of
the
noise
i
made
i
crossed
over
to
it
and
ran
my
hand
along
the
wall
underneath
the
result
was
startling
a
man
coat
and
hat
hung
from
one
of
the
pegs
i
knew
my
business
as
president
of
this
club
i
also
knew
that
no
one
should
be
in
the
house
at
this
time
that
no
one
could
be
in
it
on
any
honest
errand
some
secret
and
sinister
business
must
be
at
the
bottom
of
this
mysterious
intrusion
immediately
after
the
place
had
been
shut
for
the
winter
would
this
hat
and
coat
identify
the
intruder
i
would
strike
a
light
and
see
but
this
involved
difficulties
the
gas
had
been
turned
off
that
very
morning
and
i
had
no
matches
in
my
pocket
but
i
remembered
where
they
could
be
found
i
had
seen
them
when
i
passed
through
the
kitchen
earlier
in
the
day
they
were
very
accessible
from
the
end
of
the
hall
where
i
stood
i
had
but
to
feel
my
way
through
a
passage
or
two
and
i
should
come
to
the
kitchen
door
i
began
to
move
that
way
and
presently
came
creeping
back
with
a
half
full
of
matches
in
my
hand
but
i
did
not
strike
one
then
i
had
just
made
a
move
to
do
so
when
the
unmistakable
sound
of
a
door
opening
somewhere
in
the
house
made
me
draw
back
into
as
quiet
and
dark
a
place
as
i
could
find
this
lay
in
the
rear
and
at
the
right
of
the
staircase
and
as
the
sound
had
appeared
to
come
from
above
it
was
the
most
natural
retreat
that
offered
and
a
good
one
i
found
it
i
had
hardly
taken
up
my
stand
when
the
darkness
above
gave
way
to
a
faint
glimmer
and
a
step
became
audible
coming
from
some
one
of
the
many
small
rooms
in
the
second
story
but
so
slowly
and
with
such
evident
hesitation
that
my
imagination
had
ample
time
to
work
and
fill
my
mind
with
varying
anticipations
each
more
disconcerting
than
the
last
now
i
seemed
to
be
listening
to
the
movements
of
an
intoxicated
man
seeking
an
issue
out
of
strange
quarters
then
to
the
wary
approach
of
one
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
dread
and
was
as
conscious
of
my
presence
as
i
was
of
his
but
the
light
steadily
increasing
with
each
lagging
but
surely
advancing
step
soon
gave
the
lie
to
this
latter
supposition
since
no
sane
man
afraid
of
an
ambush
would
be
likely
to
offer
such
odds
to
the
one
lying
in
wait
for
him
as
his
own
face
illumined
by
a
flaming
candle
and
i
was
yielding
to
the
bewilderment
of
the
moment
when
the
uncertain
step
paused
and
a
sob
came
faintly
to
my
ears
wrung
from
lips
so
stiff
with
human
anguish
that
my
fears
took
on
new
shape
and
the
event
a
significance
which
in
my
present
mood
of
personal
suffering
and
preoccupation
was
anything
but
welcome
indeed
i
was
coward
enough
to
contemplate
flight
and
might
in
another
moment
have
yielded
to
the
unworthy
impulse
if
the
sound
of
a
second
sigh
had
not
struck
shudderingly
on
my
ear
followed
by
the
renewal
of
the
step
and
the
almost
immediate
appearance
on
the
stairs
of
a
young
girl
holding
a
candle
in
one
hand
and
shielding
her
left
cheek
with
the
other
life
offers
few
such
shocks
to
any
man
whatever
his
story
or
whatever
his
temperament
i
had
been
prepared
by
the
sob
i
had
heard
to
see
a
woman
but
not
this
woman
nothing
could
have
prepared
me
for
an
encounter
with
this
woman
anywhere
that
night
after
what
had
passed
between
us
and
the
wreck
she
had
made
of
my
life
but
here
in
a
place
so
remote
and
desolate
i
had
hesitated
to
enter
it
myself
what
was
i
to
think
how
was
i
to
reconcile
so
inconceivable
a
fact
with
what
i
knew
of
her
in
the
past
with
what
i
hoped
from
her
in
the
future
to
steady
my
thoughts
and
bring
my
whirling
brain
again
under
control
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
her
form
and
features
as
upon
a
whom
i
would
understand
and
judge
i
have
called
her
a
woman
and
certainly
i
had
loved
her
as
such
but
as
in
this
moment
of
strange
detachment
i
watched
her
descend
swaying
foot
following
swaying
foot
falteringly
down
the
stairs
i
was
able
to
see
that
only
the
emotions
which
denaturalised
her
expression
were
a
woman
that
her
features
her
pose
and
the
peculiar
childlike
contour
of
the
one
cheek
open
to
view
were
those
of
one
whose
yesterday
was
in
the
playroom
but
beautiful
you
do
not
often
see
such
beauty
under
all
the
disfigurement
of
an
agitation
so
great
as
to
daunt
me
and
make
me
question
if
i
were
its
sole
cause
her
face
shone
with
an
individual
charm
which
marked
her
out
as
one
of
the
few
who
are
the
making
or
marring
of
men
sometimes
of
nations
this
is
the
heritage
she
was
born
to
this
her
lot
not
to
be
shirked
not
to
be
evaded
even
now
at
her
early
age
of
seventeen
so
much
any
one
could
see
even
in
a
momentary
scrutiny
of
her
face
and
figure
but
what
was
not
so
clear
not
even
to
myself
with
the
consciousness
of
what
had
passed
between
us
during
the
last
few
hours
was
why
her
heart
should
have
so
outrun
her
years
and
the
emotion
i
beheld
betray
such
shuddering
depths
some
grisly
fear
some
staring
horror
had
met
her
in
this
strange
retreat
simple
grief
speaks
with
a
different
language
from
that
which
i
read
in
her
distorted
features
and
tottering
slowly
creeping
form
what
had
happened
above
she
had
escaped
me
to
run
upon
what
my
lips
refused
to
ask
my
limbs
refused
to
move
and
if
i
breathed
at
all
i
did
so
with
such
fierceness
of
restraint
that
her
eyes
never
turned
my
way
not
even
when
she
had
reached
the
lowest
step
and
paused
for
a
moment
there
oscillating
in
pain
or
uncertainty
her
face
was
turned
more
fully
towards
me
now
and
i
had
just
begun
to
discern
something
in
it
besides
its
tragic
beauty
when
she
made
a
quick
move
and
blew
out
the
candle
she
held
one
moment
that
magical
picture
of
superhuman
loveliness
then
darkness
i
might
say
silence
for
i
do
not
think
either
of
us
so
much
as
stirred
for
several
instants
then
there
came
a
crash
followed
by
the
sound
of
flying
feet
she
had
flung
the
candlestick
out
of
her
hand
and
was
hurriedly
crossing
the
hail
i
thought
she
was
coming
my
way
and
instinctively
drew
back
against
the
wall
but
she
stopped
far
short
of
me
and
i
heard
her
groping
about
then
give
a
sudden
spring
towards
the
front
door
it
opened
and
the
wind
soughed
in
i
felt
the
chill
of
snow
upon
my
face
and
realised
the
tempest
then
all
was
quiet
and
dark
again
she
had
slid
quickly
out
and
the
door
had
swung
to
behind
her
another
instant
and
i
heard
the
click
of
the
key
as
it
turned
in
the
lock
heard
it
and
made
no
outcry
such
the
spell
such
the
bewilderment
of
my
faculties
but
once
the
act
was
accomplished
and
egress
made
difficult
nay
for
the
moment
impossible
i
felt
all
lesser
emotions
give
way
to
an
anxiety
which
demanded
immediate
action
for
the
girl
had
gone
out
without
wraps
or
covering
for
her
head
and
my
experience
of
the
evening
had
told
me
how
cold
it
was
i
must
follow
and
find
her
and
rescue
her
if
possible
from
the
snow
the
distance
was
long
to
town
the
cold
would
seize
and
perhaps
prostrate
her
after
which
the
wind
and
snow
would
do
the
rest
throwing
myself
against
the
door
i
shook
it
violently
it
was
immovable
then
i
flew
to
the
windows
their
fastenings
yielded
readily
enough
but
not
the
windows
themselves
one
had
a
broken
cord
another
seemed
glued
to
its
frame
and
i
was
still
struggling
with
the
latter
when
i
heard
a
sound
which
lifted
the
hair
on
my
head
and
turned
my
whole
attention
back
to
what
lay
behind
and
above
me
there
was
still
some
one
in
the
house
i
had
forgotten
everything
in
this
apparition
of
the
woman
i
have
described
in
a
place
so
disassociated
with
any
conception
i
could
possibly
have
of
her
whereabouts
on
this
especial
evening
but
this
noise
short
sharp
but
too
distant
to
be
altogether
recognisable
roused
doubts
which
once
awakened
changed
the
whole
tenor
of
my
thoughts
and
would
not
let
me
rest
till
i
had
probed
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
to
find
carmel
cumberland
alone
in
this
desolation
was
a
mystifying
discovery
to
which
i
had
found
it
hard
enough
to
reconcile
myself
but
carmel
here
in
company
with
another
at
the
very
moment
when
i
had
expected
the
fruition
of
my
own
joy
ah
that
was
to
open
hell
door
in
my
breast
a
possibility
too
intolerable
to
remain
unsettled
for
an
instant
though
she
had
passed
out
before
my
eyes
in
a
drooping
almost
agonised
condition
not
she
dear
as
she
was
and
great
as
were
my
fears
in
her
regard
was
to
be
sought
out
first
but
the
man
the
man
who
was
back
of
all
this
possibly
back
of
my
disappointment
the
man
whose
work
i
may
have
witnessed
but
at
whose
identity
i
could
not
even
guess
leaving
the
window
i
groped
my
way
along
the
wall
until
i
reached
the
rack
where
the
man
coat
and
hat
hung
whether
it
was
my
intention
to
carry
them
away
and
hide
them
in
my
anxiety
to
secure
this
intruder
and
hold
him
to
a
bitter
account
for
the
misery
he
was
causing
me
or
whether
i
only
meant
to
satisfy
myself
that
they
were
the
habiliments
of
a
stranger
and
not
those
of
some
sneaking
member
of
the
club
is
of
little
importance
in
the
light
of
the
fact
which
presently
burst
upon
me
the
hat
and
coat
were
gone
nothing
hung
from
the
rack
the
wall
was
free
from
end
to
end
she
had
taken
these
articles
of
male
apparel
with
her
she
had
not
gone
forth
into
the
driving
snow
unprotected
but
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
no
acquaintanceship
with
her
girlish
impulses
nothing
that
had
occurred
between
us
before
or
during
this
night
had
prepared
me
for
a
freak
of
this
nature
i
felt
backward
along
the
wall
i
felt
forward
i
even
handled
the
pegs
and
counted
them
as
i
passed
to
and
fro
touching
every
one
but
i
could
not
alter
the
fact
the
groping
she
had
done
had
been
in
this
direction
she
was
searching
for
this
hat
and
coat
a
man
hat
a
derby
as
i
had
been
careful
to
assure
myself
at
the
first
handling
and
in
them
she
had
gone
home
as
she
had
probably
come
and
there
was
no
man
in
the
case
or
if
there
were
the
doubt
drove
me
to
the
staircase
making
no
further
effort
to
unravel
the
puzzle
which
only
beclouded
my
faculties
i
began
my
wary
ascent
i
had
not
the
slightest
fear
i
was
too
full
of
cold
rage
for
that
the
arrangement
of
rooms
on
the
second
floor
was
well
known
to
me
i
understood
every
nook
and
corner
and
could
find
my
way
about
the
whole
place
without
a
light
i
took
but
one
precaution
that
of
slipping
off
my
shoes
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
wished
to
surprise
the
intruder
i
was
willing
to
resort
to
any
expedient
to
accomplish
this
the
matches
i
carried
in
my
pocket
would
make
this
possible
if
once
i
heard
him
breathing
i
held
my
own
breath
as
i
stole
softly
up
and
waited
for
an
instant
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
listen
there
was
an
awesome
silence
everywhere
and
i
was
hesitating
whether
to
attack
the
front
rooms
first
or
to
follow
up
a
certain
narrow
hall
leading
to
a
rear
staircase
when
i
remembered
the
thin
line
of
smoke
which
rising
from
one
of
the
chimneys
had
first
attracted
my
attention
to
the
house
in
that
was
my
clue
there
was
but
one
room
on
this
floor
where
a
fire
could
be
lit
it
lay
a
few
feet
beyond
me
down
the
narrow
hall
i
have
just
mentioned
why
had
i
trusted
everything
to
my
ears
when
my
nose
would
have
been
a
better
guide
as
i
took
the
few
steps
necessary
a
slight
smell
of
smoke
became
very
perceptible
and
no
longer
in
doubt
of
my
course
i
pushed
boldly
on
and
entering
the
door
struck
a
match
and
peered
anxiously
about
emptiness
here
just
as
everywhere
else
a
few
chairs
a
dresser
it
was
a
ladies
some
smouldering
ashes
on
the
hearth
a
lounge
piled
up
with
cushions
but
no
person
the
sound
i
had
heard
had
not
issued
from
this
room
yet
something
withheld
me
from
seeking
further
chilled
to
the
bone
with
teeth
chattering
in
spite
of
myself
i
paused
just
inside
the
door
and
when
the
match
went
out
in
my
hand
remained
shivering
there
in
the
darkness
a
prey
to
sensations
more
nearly
approaching
those
of
fear
than
any
i
had
ever
before
experienced
in
my
whole
life
ii
it
was
she
she
indeed
look
on
death
itself
up
up
and
see
the
great
doom
visage
why
i
did
not
know
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
for
this
excess
of
feeling
i
had
no
dread
of
attack
my
apprehension
was
of
another
sort
besides
any
attack
here
must
come
from
the
rear
from
the
open
doorway
in
which
i
stood
and
my
dread
lay
before
me
in
the
room
itself
which
as
i
have
already
said
appeared
to
be
totally
empty
what
could
occasion
my
doubts
and
why
did
i
not
fly
the
place
there
were
yet
to
search
why
linger
here
like
a
gaby
in
the
dark
when
perhaps
the
man
i
believed
to
be
in
hiding
somewhere
within
these
walls
was
improving
the
opportunity
to
escape
if
i
asked
myself
this
question
i
did
not
answer
it
but
i
doubt
if
i
asked
it
then
i
had
forgotten
the
intruder
the
interest
which
had
carried
me
thus
far
had
become
lost
in
a
fresher
one
of
which
the
beginning
and
ending
lay
hidden
within
the
four
walls
i
now
stared
upon
unseeing
not
to
see
and
yet
to
feel
did
that
make
the
horror
if
so
another
lighted
match
must
help
me
out
i
struck
one
while
the
thought
was
hot
within
me
and
again
took
a
look
at
the
room
i
noted
but
one
thing
new
but
that
made
me
reel
back
till
i
was
half
way
into
the
hall
then
a
certain
dogged
persistency
i
possess
came
to
my
rescue
and
i
the
room
at
a
leap
and
stood
before
the
lounge
and
its
pile
of
cushions
they
were
numerous
all
that
the
room
contained
and
more
chairs
had
been
stripped
denuded
and
the
whole
collection
disposed
here
in
a
set
way
which
struck
me
as
unnatural
was
this
the
janitor
idea
i
hardly
thought
so
and
was
about
to
pluck
one
of
these
cushions
off
when
that
most
unreasonable
horror
seized
me
again
and
i
found
myself
looking
back
over
my
shoulder
at
the
fireplace
from
which
rose
a
fading
streak
of
smoke
which
some
passing
gust
perhaps
had
blown
out
into
the
room
i
felt
sick
was
it
the
smell
it
was
not
that
of
burning
wood
hardly
of
burning
paper
i
but
here
my
second
match
went
out
thoroughly
roused
now
you
will
say
by
what
i
felt
my
way
out
of
the
room
and
to
the
head
of
the
staircase
i
remembered
the
candle
and
candlestick
i
had
heard
thrown
down
on
the
lower
floor
by
carmel
cumberland
i
would
secure
them
and
come
back
and
settle
these
uncanny
doubts
it
might
be
the
veriest
fool
business
but
my
mind
was
disturbed
and
must
be
set
at
ease
nothing
else
seemed
so
important
yet
i
was
not
without
anxiety
for
the
lovely
and
delicate
woman
wandering
the
roads
in
the
teeth
of
a
furious
gale
any
more
than
i
was
dead
to
the
fact
that
i
should
never
forgive
myself
if
i
allowed
the
man
to
escape
whom
i
believed
to
be
hiding
somewhere
in
the
rear
of
this
house
i
had
a
hunt
for
the
candlestick
and
a
still
longer
one
for
the
candle
but
finally
i
recovered
both
and
lighting
the
latter
felt
myself
for
the
first
time
more
or
less
master
of
the
situation
rapidly
regaining
the
room
in
which
my
interest
was
now
centred
i
set
the
candlestick
down
on
the
dresser
and
approached
the
lounge
hardly
knowing
what
i
feared
or
what
i
expected
to
find
i
tore
off
one
of
the
cushions
and
flung
it
behind
me
more
cushions
were
revealed
but
that
was
not
all
escaping
from
the
edge
of
one
of
them
i
saw
a
shiny
tress
of
hair
i
gave
a
gasp
and
pulled
off
more
cushions
then
i
fell
on
my
knees
struck
down
by
the
greatest
horror
which
a
man
can
feel
death
lay
before
me
violent
death
and
the
victim
was
a
woman
but
it
was
not
that
though
the
head
was
not
yet
revealed
i
thought
i
knew
the
woman
and
that
she
did
seconds
pass
or
many
minutes
before
i
lifted
that
last
cushion
i
shall
never
know
it
was
an
eternity
to
me
and
i
am
not
of
a
sentimental
cast
but
i
have
some
sort
of
a
conscience
and
during
that
interval
it
awoke
it
has
never
quite
slept
since
the
cushion
had
not
concealed
the
hands
but
i
did
not
look
at
them
i
did
not
dare
i
must
first
see
the
face
but
i
did
not
twitch
this
pillow
off
i
drew
it
aside
slowly
as
though
held
by
the
restraining
clutch
of
some
one
behind
me
and
i
was
so
held
but
not
by
what
was
visible
rather
by
the
terrors
which
gather
in
the
soul
at
the
summons
of
some
dreadful
doom
i
could
not
meet
the
certainty
without
some
preparation
i
released
another
strand
of
hair
then
the
side
of
a
cheek
half
buried
out
of
sight
in
the
loosened
locks
and
bulging
pillows
then
with
prayers
to
god
for
mercy
an
icy
brow
two
staring
eyes
which
having
seen
i
let
the
cushion
drop
for
mercy
was
not
to
be
mine
it
was
she
indeed
and
judgment
was
glassed
in
the
look
i
met
judgment
and
nothing
more
kindly
however
i
might
appeal
to
heaven
for
mercy
or
whatever
the
need
of
my
fiercely
startled
and
repentant
soul
dead
adelaide
the
woman
i
had
planned
to
wrong
that
very
night
and
who
had
thus
wronged
me
for
a
moment
i
could
take
in
nothing
but
this
one
astounding
fact
then
the
how
and
the
why
woke
in
maddening
curiosity
within
me
and
seizing
the
cushion
i
dragged
it
aside
and
stared
down
into
the
pitiful
and
accusing
features
thus
revealed
as
though
to
tear
from
them
the
story
of
the
crime
which
had
released
me
as
i
would
not
have
been
released
no
not
to
have
had
my
heart
desire
in
all
the
fulness
with
which
i
had
contemplated
it
a
few
short
hours
before
but
beyond
the
ever
accusing
protuberant
stare
those
features
told
nothing
and
steeling
myself
to
the
situation
i
made
what
observation
i
could
of
her
condition
and
the
surrounding
circumstances
for
this
was
my
betrothed
wife
whatever
my
intentions
however
far
my
love
had
strayed
under
the
spell
cast
over
me
by
her
sister
the
young
girl
who
had
just
passed
out
adelaide
and
i
had
been
engaged
for
many
months
our
wedding
day
was
even
set
but
that
was
all
over
now
ended
as
her
life
was
ended
suddenly
incomprehensibly
and
by
no
stroke
of
god
even
the
jewel
on
her
finger
was
gone
the
token
of
our
betrothal
this
was
to
be
expected
she
would
be
apt
to
take
it
off
before
committing
herself
to
a
fate
that
proclaimed
me
a
traitor
to
this
symbol
i
should
see
that
ring
again
i
should
find
it
in
a
letter
filled
with
bitter
words
i
would
not
think
of
it
or
of
them
now
i
would
try
to
learn
how
she
had
committed
this
act
whether
by
poison
or
it
must
have
been
by
poison
no
other
means
would
suggest
themselves
to
one
of
her
refined
sense
but
if
so
why
those
marks
on
her
neck
growing
darker
and
darker
as
i
stared
at
them
my
senses
reeled
as
i
scrutinised
those
marks
small
delicate
but
deadly
they
stared
upon
me
from
either
side
of
her
white
neck
till
nature
could
endure
no
more
and
i
tottered
back
against
the
further
wall
beholding
no
longer
room
nor
lounge
nor
recumbent
body
but
a
young
girl
exquisite
face
set
in
lines
which
belied
her
seventeen
years
and
made
futile
any
attempt
on
my
part
at
when
my
reason
inexorably
demanded
an
explanation
of
this
death
as
suicide
it
was
comprehensible
as
murder
not
unless
and
it
had
been
murder
i
sank
to
the
floor
as
i
fully
realised
this
iii
open
bring
forth
the
parties
of
suspicion
i
am
the
greatest
as
the
time
and
place
doth
make
against
me
of
this
direful
murder
and
here
i
stand
both
to
impeach
and
purge
myself
condemned
and
myself
excused
and
i
have
mentioned
poison
as
my
first
thought
it
was
a
natural
one
the
result
undoubtedly
of
having
noticed
two
small
cordial
glasses
standing
on
a
little
table
over
against
the
fireplace
when
i
was
conscious
again
of
my
own
fears
i
crossed
to
the
table
and
peered
into
these
glasses
they
were
both
empty
however
they
had
not
been
so
long
in
each
i
found
traces
of
anisette
cordial
and
though
no
bottle
stood
near
i
was
very
confident
that
it
could
readily
be
found
somewhere
in
the
room
what
had
preceded
and
followed
the
drinking
of
this
cordial
as
i
raised
my
head
from
bending
over
these
glasses
not
club
glasses
by
the
way
i
caught
sight
of
my
face
in
the
mantel
mirror
it
gave
me
maddening
thoughts
in
this
same
mirror
there
had
been
reflected
but
a
little
while
before
two
other
faces
for
a
sight
of
whose
expression
at
that
fatal
moment
i
would
gladly
risk
my
soul
how
had
looked
how
that
other
would
not
the
story
of
those
awful
those
irrevocable
moments
be
plain
to
my
eye
if
the
quickly
responsive
glass
could
but
retain
the
impressions
it
receives
and
give
back
at
need
what
had
once
informed
its
surface
with
moving
life
i
stared
at
the
senseless
glass
appealed
to
it
with
unreasoning
frenzy
as
to
something
which
could
give
up
its
secret
if
it
would
but
only
to
meet
my
own
features
in
every
guise
of
fury
and
despair
features
i
no
longer
knew
features
which
insensibly
increased
my
horror
till
i
tore
myself
wildly
from
the
spot
and
cast
about
for
further
clues
to
enlightenment
before
yielding
to
the
conviction
which
was
making
a
turmoil
in
mind
heart
and
conscience
alas
there
was
but
little
more
to
see
a
pair
of
lay
on
the
hearth
but
i
had
no
sooner
lifted
them
than
i
dropped
them
with
a
shudder
of
unspeakable
loathing
only
to
start
at
the
noise
they
made
in
striking
the
tiles
for
it
was
the
noise
i
had
heard
when
listening
from
below
these
tongs
set
up
against
the
side
of
the
fireplace
had
been
jarred
down
by
the
forcible
shutting
of
the
large
front
door
and
no
man
other
than
myself
was
in
the
house
or
had
been
in
the
house
only
the
two
women
but
the
time
when
this
discovery
would
have
brought
comfort
was
passed
better
a
hundred
times
that
a
man
i
had
almost
said
any
man
should
have
been
with
them
here
than
that
they
should
be
closeted
together
in
a
spot
so
secluded
with
rancour
and
cause
for
complaint
in
one
heart
and
a
biting
deadly
flame
in
the
other
which
once
reaching
up
must
from
its
very
nature
leave
behind
it
a
corrosive
impress
i
saw
felt
but
i
did
not
desist
from
my
investigations
a
stick
or
two
still
smouldered
on
the
hearthstone
in
the
ashes
lay
some
scattered
fragments
of
paper
which
crumbled
at
my
touch
on
the
floor
in
front
i
espied
only
a
stray
everything
else
was
in
place
throughout
the
room
except
the
cushions
and
that
horror
on
the
lounge
waiting
the
second
look
i
had
so
far
refrained
from
giving
it
that
look
i
could
no
longer
withhold
i
must
know
the
depth
of
the
gulf
over
which
i
hung
i
must
not
wrong
with
a
thought
one
who
had
smiled
upon
me
like
an
angel
of
light
a
young
girl
too
with
the
dew
of
innocence
on
her
beauty
to
every
eye
but
mine
and
only
not
to
mine
within
shall
i
say
ten
awful
minutes
it
seemed
ages
all
of
my
life
and
more
yet
that
lovely
breast
had
heaved
not
so
many
times
since
i
looked
upon
her
as
a
deified
mortal
and
now
two
small
spots
on
another
woman
pulseless
throat
had
drawn
a
veil
of
blood
over
that
beauty
and
given
to
a
child
the
attributes
of
a
medusa
yet
hope
was
not
quite
stilled
i
would
look
again
and
perhaps
discover
that
my
own
eyes
had
been
at
fault
that
there
were
no
marks
or
if
marks
not
just
the
ones
my
fancy
had
painted
there
turning
i
let
my
glance
fall
first
on
the
feet
i
had
not
noted
them
before
and
i
was
startled
to
see
that
the
arctics
in
which
they
were
clad
were
filled
all
around
with
snow
she
had
walked
then
as
the
other
was
walking
now
she
who
detested
every
effort
and
was
of
such
delicate
make
that
exertion
of
unusual
kind
could
not
readily
be
associated
with
her
had
she
come
alone
or
in
carmel
company
and
if
in
company
on
what
ostensible
errand
if
not
that
of
death
her
dress
which
was
of
dark
wool
showed
that
she
had
changed
her
garments
for
this
trip
i
had
seen
her
at
dinner
and
this
was
not
the
gown
she
had
worn
then
the
gown
in
which
she
had
confronted
me
during
those
few
intolerable
minutes
when
i
could
not
meet
her
eyes
fatal
cowardice
a
moment
of
realisation
then
and
we
might
all
have
been
saved
this
horror
of
sin
and
death
and
shameful
retribution
and
yet
who
knows
not
understanding
what
i
saw
how
could
i
measure
the
i
would
proceed
with
my
task
note
if
she
wore
the
diamond
brooch
i
had
given
her
no
she
was
without
ornament
i
had
never
seen
her
so
plainly
clad
might
i
draw
a
hope
from
this
even
the
pins
which
had
fallen
from
her
hair
were
such
as
she
wore
when
least
adorned
nothing
spoke
of
the
dinner
party
or
of
her
having
been
dragged
here
unaware
but
all
of
previous
intent
and
premeditation
surely
hope
was
getting
uppermost
if
i
had
dreamed
the
marks
but
no
there
they
were
unmistakable
and
damning
just
where
the
breath
struggles
up
i
put
my
own
thumbs
on
these
two
dark
spots
to
see
if
when
what
was
it
a
lightning
stroke
or
a
call
of
fate
which
one
must
answer
while
sense
remains
i
felt
my
head
pulled
around
by
some
unseen
force
from
behind
and
met
staring
into
mine
through
the
glass
of
the
window
a
pair
of
burning
eyes
or
was
it
fantasy
for
in
another
moment
they
were
gone
nor
was
i
in
the
condition
just
then
to
dissociate
the
real
from
the
unreal
but
the
possibility
of
a
person
having
seen
me
in
this
position
before
the
dead
was
enough
to
startle
me
to
my
feet
and
though
in
another
instant
i
became
convinced
that
i
had
been
the
victim
of
hallucination
i
nevertheless
made
haste
to
cross
to
the
window
and
take
a
look
through
its
dismal
panes
a
gale
of
blinding
snow
was
sweeping
past
making
all
things
indistinguishable
but
the
absence
of
balcony
outside
was
reassuring
and
i
stepped
hastily
back
asking
myself
for
the
first
time
what
i
should
do
and
where
i
should
now
go
to
ensure
myself
from
being
called
as
a
witness
to
the
awful
occurrence
which
had
just
taken
place
in
this
house
should
i
go
home
and
by
some
sort
of
subterfuge
now
unthought
of
try
to
deceive
my
servants
as
to
the
time
of
my
return
or
attempt
to
create
an
alibi
elsewhere
something
i
must
do
to
save
myself
the
anguish
and
carmel
the
danger
of
my
testimony
in
this
matter
she
must
never
know
the
world
must
never
know
that
i
had
seen
her
here
i
had
lost
at
a
blow
everything
that
gives
zest
or
meaning
to
life
but
i
might
still
be
spared
the
bottommost
depth
of
misery
be
saved
the
utterance
of
the
word
which
would
sink
that
erring
but
delicate
soul
into
the
hell
yawning
beneath
her
it
was
my
one
thought
now
though
i
knew
that
the
woman
who
had
fallen
victim
to
her
childish
hate
had
loved
me
deeply
and
was
well
worth
my
avenging
i
could
not
be
the
death
of
two
women
the
loss
of
one
weighed
heavily
enough
upon
my
conscience
i
would
fly
the
place
i
would
leave
this
ghastly
find
to
tell
its
own
story
the
night
was
stormy
the
hour
late
the
spot
a
remote
one
and
the
road
to
it
but
little
used
i
could
easily
escape
and
when
the
morrow
came
but
it
was
the
present
i
must
think
of
now
this
hour
this
moment
how
came
i
to
stay
so
long
in
feverish
haste
i
began
to
throw
the
pillows
back
over
the
quiet
limbs
the
accusing
face
shudderingly
i
hid
those
eyes
i
understood
their
strange
protuberance
now
and
recklessly
bent
on
flight
was
half
way
across
the
floor
when
my
feet
were
stayed
i
wonder
that
my
reason
was
not
unseated
by
a
sudden
and
tremendous
attack
on
the
great
door
below
mingled
with
loud
cries
to
open
which
ran
thundering
through
the
house
calling
up
innumerable
echoes
from
its
dead
and
hidden
corners
it
was
the
police
the
wild
night
the
biting
storm
had
been
of
no
avail
an
alarm
had
reached
headquarters
and
all
hope
of
escape
on
my
part
was
at
an
end
yet
because
at
such
crises
instinct
rises
superior
to
reason
i
blew
out
the
candle
and
softly
made
my
way
into
the
hall
i
had
remembered
a
window
opening
over
a
shed
at
the
head
of
the
kitchen
staircase
i
could
reach
it
from
this
rear
hall
by
just
a
turn
or
two
and
once
on
that
shed
a
short
leap
would
land
me
on
the
ground
after
which
i
could
easily
trust
to
the
storm
to
conceal
my
flight
across
the
open
it
was
worth
trying
at
least
anything
was
better
than
being
found
in
the
house
with
my
murdered
betrothed
i
had
no
reason
to
think
that
i
was
being
sought
or
that
my
presence
in
this
building
was
even
suspected
it
might
well
be
that
the
police
were
even
ignorant
of
the
tragedy
awaiting
them
across
the
threshold
of
the
door
they
seemed
intent
on
battering
down
the
gleam
of
a
candle
burning
in
this
house
or
even
the
tale
told
by
the
rising
smoke
may
have
drawn
them
from
the
road
to
investigate
such
coincidences
had
been
such
untoward
happenings
had
misled
people
into
useless
my
case
was
too
desperate
for
such
weakness
flight
at
this
moment
might
save
all
i
would
at
least
attempt
it
the
door
was
shaking
on
its
hinges
these
intruders
seemed
determined
to
enter
with
a
spring
i
reached
the
window
by
which
i
hoped
to
escape
and
quickly
raised
it
a
torrent
of
snow
swept
in
covering
my
face
and
breast
in
a
moment
it
did
something
more
it
cleared
my
brain
and
i
remembered
my
poor
horse
standing
in
this
blinding
gale
under
cover
of
the
pines
every
one
knew
my
horse
i
could
commit
no
greater
folly
than
to
flee
by
the
rear
fields
while
such
a
witness
to
my
presence
remained
in
full
view
in
front
with
the
sensation
of
a
trapped
animal
i
reclosed
the
window
and
cast
about
for
a
safe
corner
where
i
could
lie
concealed
until
i
learned
what
had
brought
these
men
here
and
how
much
i
really
had
to
fear
from
their
presence
i
had
but
little
time
in
which
to
choose
the
door
below
had
just
given
way
and
a
party
of
at
least
three
men
were
already
stamping
their
feet
free
from
snow
in
the
hall
i
did
not
like
the
tone
of
their
voices
it
was
too
low
and
steady
to
suit
me
i
had
rather
have
heard
drunken
cries
or
a
burst
of
wild
hilarity
than
these
stern
and
purposeful
whispers
men
of
resolution
could
have
but
one
errand
here
my
doom
was
closing
round
me
i
could
only
put
off
the
fatal
moment
but
it
was
better
to
do
this
than
to
plunge
headlong
into
the
unknown
fate
awaiting
me
i
knew
of
a
possible
place
of
concealment
it
was
in
the
ballroom
not
far
from
where
i
stood
i
remembered
the
spot
well
it
was
at
the
top
of
a
little
staircase
leading
to
the
musicians
gallery
a
balustrade
guarded
this
gallery
supported
by
a
boarding
wide
enough
to
hide
a
man
lying
behind
it
at
his
full
length
if
the
search
i
was
endeavouring
to
evade
was
not
minute
enough
to
lead
them
to
look
behind
this
boarding
it
would
offer
me
the
double
advantage
of
concealment
and
an
unobstructed
view
of
what
went
on
in
the
hall
through
the
main
doorway
opening
directly
opposite
i
could
reach
this
ballroom
and
its
terminal
gallery
without
going
around
to
this
door
a
smaller
one
communicated
directly
with
the
corridor
in
which
i
was
then
lurking
and
towards
this
i
now
made
my
way
with
all
the
precaution
suggested
by
my
desperate
situation
no
man
ever
moved
more
lightly
the
shoes
which
i
had
taken
off
in
the
lower
hall
were
yet
in
my
hand
i
had
caught
them
up
after
replacing
the
cushions
on
adelaide
body
even
to
my
own
straining
ears
i
made
no
perceptible
sound
i
reached
the
balcony
and
had
stretched
myself
out
at
full
length
behind
the
boarding
before
the
men
below
had
left
the
lower
floor
an
interval
of
and
wearing
suspense
now
followed
they
were
ransacking
the
rooms
below
by
the
aid
of
their
own
lanterns
as
i
could
tell
from
their
assured
manner
that
they
had
not
made
at
once
for
the
scene
of
crime
brought
me
some
small
sense
of
comfort
but
not
much
they
were
too
resolute
in
their
movements
and
much
too
thorough
and
methodical
in
their
search
for
me
to
dream
of
their
confining
their
investigations
to
the
first
floor
unless
i
very
much
mistook
their
purpose
i
should
soon
hear
them
ascending
the
stairs
after
which
instinct
if
not
the
faint
smell
of
smoke
still
lingering
in
the
air
would
lead
them
to
the
room
where
my
poor
adelaide
lay
and
thus
it
proved
more
quickly
than
i
expected
the
total
darkness
in
which
i
lay
brightened
under
an
advancing
lantern
and
i
heard
the
steps
of
two
men
coming
down
the
hall
it
was
a
steady
if
not
rapid
approach
and
i
was
quite
prepared
for
their
presence
when
they
finally
reached
the
doorway
opposite
and
stopped
to
look
in
at
what
must
have
appeared
to
them
a
vast
and
empty
space
they
were
officials
true
enough
one
hasty
glance
through
the
balustrade
assured
me
of
that
i
even
knew
one
of
them
by
name
he
was
a
sergeant
of
police
and
a
highly
trustworthy
man
but
how
they
had
been
drawn
to
this
place
at
a
moment
so
critical
i
could
not
surmise
do
men
of
this
stamp
scent
crime
as
a
hound
scents
out
prey
they
had
the
look
of
hounds
even
in
the
momentary
glimpse
i
got
of
them
i
noted
the
tense
and
expectant
look
with
which
they
endeavoured
to
pierce
the
dim
spaces
between
us
the
chase
was
on
it
was
something
more
than
curiosity
or
a
chance
exercise
of
their
duty
which
had
brought
them
here
their
object
was
definite
and
if
the
sight
of
the
low
gallery
in
which
i
lay
should
suggest
to
them
all
its
possibilities
as
a
i
should
know
in
just
one
moment
more
what
it
is
for
the
helpless
quarry
to
feel
the
clutch
of
the
captor
but
the
moment
passed
without
any
attempt
at
approach
on
their
part
and
when
i
lifted
my
head
again
it
was
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
their
side
faces
as
they
turned
to
look
elsewhere
for
what
they
were
plainly
in
search
of
an
oath
muffled
but
stern
which
was
the
first
word
above
a
whisper
that
i
had
heard
issue
from
their
lips
told
me
that
they
had
reached
room
and
had
come
upon
the
horror
which
lay
there
what
would
they
say
to
it
would
they
know
who
she
was
her
name
her
quality
her
story
and
respect
her
dead
as
they
certainly
must
have
respected
her
living
i
listened
but
caught
only
a
low
murmur
as
they
conferred
together
i
imagined
their
movements
saw
them
in
my
mind
eye
leaning
over
that
couch
pointing
with
accusing
finger
at
those
two
dark
marks
and
consulting
each
other
with
looks
as
they
passed
from
one
detail
of
her
appearance
to
another
i
even
imagined
them
crossing
the
floor
and
lifting
the
two
cordial
glasses
just
as
i
had
done
and
then
slowly
setting
them
down
again
with
perhaps
a
lift
of
the
brows
or
a
suggestive
shake
of
the
head
and
maddened
by
my
own
intolerable
position
drawn
by
a
power
i
felt
it
impossible
to
resist
i
crept
to
my
feet
and
took
my
staggering
way
down
the
steps
of
the
gallery
and
thence
along
by
the
wall
towards
the
further
doorway
and
through
it
to
where
these
men
stood
weighing
the
chances
in
which
my
life
and
honour
were
involved
and
those
of
one
other
of
whom
i
dared
not
think
and
would
not
have
these
men
think
for
all
that
was
left
me
of
hope
and
happiness
it
was
dark
in
the
ballroom
and
it
was
only
a
little
less
so
in
the
corridor
all
the
light
was
in
room
but
i
still
slid
along
the
wall
like
a
thief
with
eyes
set
and
ears
agape
for
any
chance
word
which
might
reach
me
suddenly
i
heard
one
it
was
this
uttered
with
a
decision
which
had
the
strange
effect
of
lifting
my
head
and
making
a
man
of
me
again
that
settles
it
he
will
find
it
hard
to
escape
after
this
i
had
been
dreading
to
hear
a
yet
why
who
on
god
earth
save
myself
could
know
that
carmel
had
been
within
these
woeful
walls
i
never
stopped
to
question
who
was
meant
by
this
definite
pronoun
i
was
not
even
conscious
of
caring
very
much
i
was
in
a
coil
of
threatening
troubles
but
i
was
in
it
alone
and
greatly
relieved
by
the
discovery
i
drew
myself
up
and
stepped
quickly
forward
into
the
room
where
the
two
officials
stood
their
faces
as
they
wheeled
sharply
about
and
took
in
my
shoeless
and
more
or
less
dishevelled
figure
told
me
with
an
eloquence
which
made
my
heart
sink
the
unfortunate
impression
which
my
presence
made
upon
them
it
was
but
a
fleeting
look
for
these
men
were
both
by
nature
and
training
easy
masters
of
themselves
but
its
language
was
unmistakable
and
i
knew
that
if
i
were
to
hold
my
own
with
them
i
must
get
all
the
support
i
could
from
the
truth
save
where
it
would
involve
her
from
the
truth
and
my
own
consciousness
of
innocence
if
i
had
any
such
consciousness
i
was
not
sure
that
i
had
for
my
falseness
had
precipitated
this
tragedy
how
i
might
never
know
but
a
knowledge
of
the
how
was
not
necessary
to
my
nevertheless
my
hands
were
clean
of
this
murder
and
allowing
the
surety
of
this
fact
to
take
a
foremost
place
in
my
mind
i
faced
these
men
and
with
real
feeling
but
as
little
display
of
it
as
possible
i
observed
you
have
come
to
my
aid
in
a
critical
moment
this
is
my
betrothed
wife
the
woman
i
was
to
marry
and
i
find
her
lying
here
dead
in
this
closed
and
lonely
house
what
does
it
mean
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
iv
the
odd
candlestick
it
is
a
damned
and
a
bloody
work
the
graceless
action
of
a
heavy
hand
if
that
it
be
the
work
of
any
hand
the
two
men
eyed
me
quietly
then
hexford
pointed
to
my
shoeless
feet
and
sternly
retorted
permit
us
to
doubt
your
last
assertion
you
seem
to
be
in
better
position
than
ourselves
to
explain
the
circumstances
which
puzzle
you
they
were
right
it
was
for
me
to
talk
not
for
them
i
conceded
the
point
in
these
words
perhaps
but
you
can
not
always
trust
appearances
i
can
explain
my
own
presence
here
and
the
condition
in
which
you
find
me
but
i
can
not
explain
this
tragedy
near
and
dear
as
miss
cumberland
was
to
me
i
did
not
know
she
was
in
the
building
alive
or
dead
i
came
upon
her
here
covered
with
the
cushions
just
as
you
found
her
i
have
felt
the
shock
i
do
not
look
like
myself
i
do
not
feel
like
myself
it
was
enough
here
real
emotion
seized
me
and
i
almost
broke
down
i
was
in
a
position
much
more
dreadful
than
any
they
could
imagine
or
should
be
allowed
to
their
silence
led
me
to
examine
their
faces
hexford
mouth
had
settled
into
a
stiff
straight
line
and
the
other
man
wore
a
cynical
smile
i
did
not
like
at
this
presage
of
the
difficulties
awaiting
me
i
felt
one
strand
of
the
rope
sustaining
me
above
this
yawning
gulf
of
shame
and
ignominy
crack
and
give
way
oh
for
a
better
record
in
the
past
a
staff
on
which
to
lean
in
such
an
hour
as
this
but
while
nothing
serious
clouded
my
name
i
had
more
to
blush
for
than
to
pride
myself
upon
in
my
career
as
prince
of
good
fellows
and
these
men
knew
it
both
of
them
and
let
it
weigh
in
the
scale
already
tipped
far
off
its
balance
by
coincidences
which
a
better
man
than
myself
would
have
found
it
embarrassing
to
explain
i
recognised
all
this
i
say
in
the
momentary
glance
i
cast
at
their
stern
and
unresponsive
figures
but
the
courage
which
had
served
me
in
lesser
extremities
did
not
fail
me
now
and
kneeling
down
before
my
dead
betrothed
i
kissed
her
cold
white
hand
with
sincere
compunction
before
attempting
the
garbled
and
probably
totally
incoherent
story
with
which
i
endeavoured
to
explain
the
inexplainable
situation
they
listened
i
will
do
them
that
much
justice
but
it
was
with
such
an
air
of
incredulity
that
my
words
fell
with
less
and
less
continuity
and
finally
lost
themselves
in
a
confused
stammer
as
i
reached
the
point
where
i
pulled
the
cushions
from
the
couch
and
made
my
ghastly
discovery
you
see
see
for
yourselves
what
confronted
me
my
betrothed
a
dainty
delicate
woman
dead
alone
in
this
solitary
spot
the
victim
of
what
i
asked
myself
then
i
ask
myself
now
i
can
not
understand
it
or
those
glasses
yonder
or
marks
they
were
black
by
this
time
unmistakable
not
to
be
ignored
by
them
or
by
me
we
understand
those
marks
and
you
ought
to
came
from
the
second
man
the
one
i
did
not
know
my
head
fell
forward
my
lips
refused
to
speak
the
words
i
saw
as
in
a
flash
a
picture
of
the
one
woman
bending
over
the
other
terror
reproach
anguish
in
the
eyes
whose
fixed
stare
would
never
more
leave
my
consciousness
an
access
of
rage
or
some
such
sadden
passion
animating
the
other
whose
every
curve
spoke
tenderness
whose
every
look
up
to
this
awful
day
had
been
as
an
angel
look
to
me
the
vision
was
a
maddening
one
i
shook
myself
free
from
it
by
starting
to
my
feet
it
it
i
gasped
she
has
been
strangled
quoth
hexford
doggedly
a
dog
death
mumbled
the
other
my
hands
came
together
involuntarily
at
that
instant
with
the
memory
before
me
of
the
vision
i
have
just
described
i
almost
wished
that
it
had
been
hate
anger
which
had
brought
those
marks
out
upon
that
livid
skin
i
should
have
suffered
less
i
should
only
have
had
to
pay
the
penalty
of
my
crime
and
not
be
forced
to
think
of
carmel
with
terrible
revulsion
as
i
was
now
thinking
minute
by
minute
fight
with
it
as
i
would
you
had
better
sit
down
hexford
suddenly
suggested
pushing
a
chair
my
way
clarke
look
up
the
telephone
and
ask
for
three
more
men
i
am
going
into
this
matter
thoroughly
perhaps
you
will
tell
us
where
the
telephone
is
he
asked
turning
my
way
it
was
some
little
time
before
i
took
in
these
words
when
i
did
i
became
conscious
of
his
keen
look
also
of
a
change
in
my
own
expression
i
had
forgotten
the
telephone
it
had
not
yet
been
taken
out
if
only
i
had
remembered
this
before
these
men
came
i
might
have
saved
no
nothing
could
have
saved
her
or
me
except
the
snow
except
the
snow
that
may
already
have
saved
her
all
this
time
i
was
trying
to
tell
where
the
telephone
was
that
i
succeeded
at
last
i
judged
from
the
fact
that
the
second
man
left
the
room
as
he
did
so
hexford
lit
the
candle
idly
watching
for
nothing
now
could
make
me
look
at
the
lounge
again
i
noticed
the
candlestick
it
was
of
brass
and
rare
in
style
and
workmanship
a
candlestick
to
be
remembered
one
of
a
pair
perhaps
i
felt
my
hair
stir
as
i
took
in
the
details
of
its
shape
and
ornamentation
if
its
mate
were
in
her
house
no
no
no
i
would
not
have
it
so
i
could
not
control
my
emotion
if
i
let
my
imagination
stray
too
far
the
candlestick
must
be
the
property
of
the
club
i
had
only
forgotten
it
was
bought
when
while
thinking
planning
i
was
conscious
of
eyes
fixed
steadily
upon
me
did
you
go
into
the
kitchen
in
your
wanderings
below
he
asked
no
i
began
but
seeing
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
i
bungled
and
added
weakly
yes
after
matches
only
matches
that
all
and
did
you
get
them
yes
in
the
dark
you
must
have
had
trouble
in
finding
them
not
at
all
only
safety
matches
are
allowed
here
and
they
are
put
in
a
receptacle
at
the
side
of
each
door
i
had
but
to
open
the
kitchen
door
feel
along
the
jamb
find
this
receptacle
and
pull
the
box
out
i
well
used
to
all
parts
of
the
house
and
you
did
this
i
have
said
so
may
i
ask
which
door
you
allude
to
the
one
communicating
with
the
front
hall
where
did
you
light
your
first
match
upstairs
not
in
the
kitchen
no
sir
you
are
sure
quite
sure
that
a
pity
i
thought
you
might
be
able
to
tell
me
how
so
many
wine
and
whiskey
bottles
came
to
be
standing
on
the
kitchen
table
i
stared
at
him
dazed
then
i
remembered
the
two
small
glasses
on
the
little
table
across
the
room
and
instinctively
glanced
at
them
but
no
whiskey
had
been
drunk
out
of
them
the
odor
of
anisette
is
unmistakable
you
carry
the
key
to
the
he
asked
i
considered
a
moment
i
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
bottles
on
the
kitchen
table
these
women
and
they
abhorred
wine
they
had
reason
to
god
knows
t
remembered
the
dinner
and
all
that
had
signalised
it
and
felt
my
confusion
grow
but
a
question
had
been
asked
and
i
must
answer
it
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
hesitate
about
a
matter
of
this
kind
only
what
was
the
question
something
about
a
key
i
had
no
key
the
cellar
had
been
ransacked
without
my
help
should
i
acknowledge
this
the
keys
were
given
up
by
the
janitor
yesterday
i
managed
to
stammer
at
last
but
i
did
not
bring
them
here
they
are
in
my
rooms
at
home
i
finished
with
a
gasp
i
had
suddenly
remembered
that
these
keys
were
not
in
my
rooms
i
had
had
them
with
me
at
miss
cumberland
and
being
given
to
fooling
with
something
when
embarrassed
i
had
fooled
with
them
and
dropped
them
while
talking
with
adelaide
and
watching
carmel
i
had
meant
to
pick
them
up
but
i
forgot
and
you
need
say
nothing
more
about
it
remarked
hexford
i
have
no
right
to
question
you
at
all
and
stepping
across
the
room
he
took
up
the
glasses
one
after
the
other
and
smelled
of
them
some
sweet
stuff
he
remarked
cordial
i
should
say
anisette
there
was
anything
like
that
on
the
kitchen
table
let
us
see
what
there
is
in
here
he
added
stepping
into
the
adjoining
small
room
into
which
i
had
simply
peered
in
my
own
investigation
of
the
place
as
he
did
so
a
keen
blast
blew
in
a
window
in
the
adjoining
room
was
open
he
cast
me
a
hurried
glance
and
with
the
door
in
his
hand
made
the
following
remark
your
lady
love
the
victim
here
could
not
have
come
through
the
snow
with
no
more
clothing
on
her
than
we
see
now
she
must
have
worn
a
hat
and
coat
or
furs
or
something
of
that
nature
let
us
look
for
them
i
rose
stumbling
i
saw
that
he
did
not
mean
to
leave
me
alone
for
a
moment
indeed
i
did
not
wish
to
be
so
left
better
any
companionship
than
that
of
my
own
thoughts
and
of
her
white
upturned
face
as
i
followed
him
into
this
closet
he
pushed
the
door
wide
pulling
out
an
electric
torch
as
he
did
so
by
its
light
we
saw
almost
at
first
glance
the
coat
and
hat
he
professed
to
seek
lying
in
a
corner
of
the
floor
beside
an
overturned
chair
good
left
my
companion
lips
that
all
straight
you
recognise
these
garments
i
nodded
speechless
a
thousand
memories
rushed
upon
me
at
the
sight
of
the
long
plush
coat
which
i
had
so
often
buttoned
about
her
with
a
troubled
heart
how
her
eyes
would
seek
mine
as
we
stood
thus
close
together
searching
searching
for
the
old
love
or
the
fancied
love
of
which
the
ashes
only
remained
torment
all
torment
to
remember
now
as
hexford
must
have
seen
if
the
keenness
of
his
intelligence
equalled
that
of
his
eye
at
this
moment
the
window
which
stood
open
was
a
small
one
mere
slit
in
the
wall
but
it
let
in
a
stream
of
zero
air
and
i
saw
hexford
shiver
as
he
stepped
towards
it
and
looked
out
but
i
felt
hot
rather
than
cold
and
when
i
instinctively
put
my
hand
to
my
forehead
it
came
away
wet
v
a
scrap
of
paper
look
to
the
lady
and
when
we
have
our
naked
frailties
hid
that
suffer
in
exposure
let
us
meet
and
question
this
most
bloody
piece
of
work
to
know
it
further
fears
and
scruples
shake
us
in
the
great
hand
of
god
i
stand
and
thence
against
the
undivulg
pretence
i
fight
of
treasonous
malice
shortly
after
this
a
fresh
relay
of
police
arrived
and
i
could
hear
the
whole
house
being
ransacked
i
had
found
my
shoes
and
was
sitting
in
my
own
private
room
before
a
fire
which
had
been
lighted
for
me
on
the
hearth
i
was
in
a
state
of
stupor
now
and
if
my
body
shook
as
it
did
from
time
to
time
it
was
not
from
cold
nor
do
i
think
from
any
special
horror
of
mind
or
soul
i
felt
too
dull
for
that
but
in
response
to
the
shuddering
pines
which
pressed
up
close
to
the
house
at
this
point
and
soughed
and
tapped
at
the
walls
and
muttered
among
themselves
with
an
insistence
which
i
could
not
ignore
notwithstanding
my
many
reasons
for
the
storm
which
had
been
exceedingly
fierce
while
it
lasted
had
quieted
down
to
a
steady
fall
of
snow
had
its
mission
been
to
serve
as
a
blanket
to
this
crime
by
wiping
out
from
the
old
snow
all
footsteps
and
such
other
records
as
simplify
cases
of
this
kind
for
the
detectives
it
could
not
have
happened
more
to
the
event
from
the
complaints
which
had
already
reached
my
ears
from
the
two
policemen
i
was
quite
aware
that
even
as
early
as
their
first
arrival
they
had
found
a
clean
page
where
possibly
a
few
minutes
before
the
whole
secret
of
this
tragedy
may
have
been
written
in
unmistakable
characters
and
while
this
tilled
me
with
relief
in
one
way
it
added
to
my
care
in
another
for
the
storm
which
could
accomplish
so
much
in
so
short
a
time
was
a
bitter
one
for
a
young
girl
to
meet
and
carmel
must
have
met
it
at
its
worst
in
her
lonesome
struggle
homeward
where
was
she
living
or
dead
where
was
she
now
and
where
was
adelaide
the
two
women
who
for
the
last
six
weeks
had
filled
my
life
with
so
many
unhallowed
and
conflicting
emotions
the
conjecture
passed
incessantly
through
my
brain
but
it
passed
idly
also
and
was
not
answered
even
in
thought
indeed
i
seemed
incapable
of
sustaining
any
line
of
thought
for
more
than
an
instant
and
when
after
an
indefinite
length
of
time
the
door
behind
me
opened
the
look
i
turned
upon
the
gentleman
who
entered
must
have
been
a
strange
and
far
from
encouraging
one
he
brought
a
lantern
with
him
so
far
the
room
had
had
no
other
illumination
than
such
as
came
from
the
fire
and
when
he
had
set
this
lantern
down
on
the
mantel
and
turned
to
face
me
i
perceived
with
a
sort
of
sluggish
hope
that
he
was
perry
once
a
practising
physician
and
my
father
intimate
friend
now
a
county
official
of
no
ordinary
intelligence
and
what
was
better
of
no
ordinary
feeling
his
attachment
to
my
father
had
not
descended
to
me
and
for
the
moment
he
treated
me
like
a
stranger
i
am
the
coroner
of
this
district
said
he
i
have
left
my
bed
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
and
learn
if
your
detention
here
is
warranted
you
are
the
president
of
this
club
and
the
lady
whose
violent
death
in
this
place
i
have
been
called
upon
to
investigate
is
miss
cumberland
your
affianced
wife
my
assent
though
hardly
audible
was
not
to
be
misunderstood
drawing
up
a
chair
he
sat
down
and
something
in
his
manner
which
was
not
wholly
without
sympathy
heartened
me
still
more
dispelling
some
of
the
cloudiness
which
had
hitherto
befogged
my
faculties
they
have
told
me
what
you
had
to
say
in
explanation
of
your
presence
here
where
a
crime
of
some
nature
has
taken
place
but
i
should
like
to
hear
the
story
from
your
own
lips
i
feel
that
i
owe
you
this
consideration
at
all
events
i
am
disposed
to
show
it
this
is
no
common
case
of
violence
and
the
parties
to
it
are
not
of
the
common
order
miss
cumberland
virtue
and
social
standing
no
one
can
question
while
you
are
the
son
of
a
man
who
has
deservedly
been
regarded
as
an
honour
to
the
town
you
have
been
intending
to
marry
miss
cumberland
yes
i
looked
the
man
directly
in
the
eye
our
was
set
did
you
love
her
pardon
me
if
i
am
to
be
of
any
benefit
to
you
at
this
crisis
i
must
strike
at
the
root
of
things
if
you
do
not
wish
to
answer
say
so
mr
ranelagh
i
do
wish
this
was
a
lie
but
what
was
i
to
do
knowing
how
dangerous
it
would
be
for
carmel
to
have
it
publicly
known
where
my
affections
were
really
centred
and
what
a
secret
tragedy
of
and
jealous
passion
underlay
this
open
one
of
foul
and
murderous
death
i
am
in
no
position
to
conceal
anything
from
you
i
did
love
miss
cumberland
we
have
been
engaged
for
a
year
she
was
a
woman
of
fortune
but
i
am
not
without
means
of
my
own
and
could
have
chosen
a
penniless
girl
and
still
been
called
prosperous
i
see
and
she
returned
your
love
sincerely
was
the
room
light
enough
to
reveal
my
guilty
flush
she
had
loved
me
only
too
well
too
jealously
too
absorbingly
for
her
happiness
or
mine
and
the
sister
it
was
gently
but
gravely
put
and
instantly
i
knew
that
our
secret
was
out
however
safe
we
had
considered
it
this
man
was
cognisant
of
it
and
if
he
why
not
others
why
not
the
whole
town
a
danger
which
up
to
this
moment
i
had
heard
whispered
only
by
the
pines
was
opening
in
a
gulf
beneath
our
feet
its
imminence
steadied
me
i
had
kept
my
glance
on
coroner
perry
and
i
do
not
think
it
changed
my
tone
i
am
quite
assured
was
almost
as
quiet
and
grave
as
his
as
i
made
my
reply
in
these
words
her
sister
is
her
sister
i
hardly
think
that
either
of
us
would
be
apt
to
forget
that
have
you
heard
otherwise
sir
he
was
prepared
for
equivocation
possibly
for
denial
but
not
for
attack
his
manner
changed
and
showed
distrust
and
i
saw
that
i
had
lost
rather
than
made
by
this
venturous
move
is
this
your
writing
he
suddenly
asked
showing
me
a
morsel
of
paper
which
he
had
drawn
from
his
vest
pocket
i
looked
and
felt
that
i
now
understood
what
the
pines
had
been
trying
to
tell
me
for
the
last
few
hours
that
compromising
scrap
of
writing
had
not
been
destroyed
it
existed
for
her
and
my
undoing
then
doubt
came
fate
could
not
juggle
thus
with
human
souls
and
purposes
i
had
simply
imagined
myself
to
have
recognised
the
words
lengthening
and
losing
themselves
in
a
blur
before
my
eyes
carmel
was
no
fool
even
if
she
had
wild
and
demoniacal
moments
this
could
not
be
my
note
to
her
that
fatal
note
which
would
make
all
denial
of
our
mutual
passion
unavailing
is
it
your
writing
my
watchful
inquisitor
repeated
i
looked
again
the
scrap
was
smaller
than
my
note
had
been
when
it
left
my
hands
if
it
were
the
same
then
some
of
the
words
were
gone
were
they
the
first
ones
or
the
last
it
would
make
a
difference
in
the
reading
or
rather
in
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
what
remained
if
only
the
mist
would
clear
from
before
my
eyes
or
he
would
hold
the
slip
of
paper
nearer
the
room
was
very
dark
the
the
is
it
your
writing
coroner
perry
asked
for
the
third
time
there
was
no
denying
it
my
writing
was
peculiar
and
quite
unmistakable
i
should
gain
nothing
by
saying
no
it
looks
like
it
i
admitted
reluctantly
but
i
can
not
be
sure
in
this
light
may
i
ask
what
this
bit
of
paper
is
and
where
you
found
it
its
contents
i
think
you
know
as
for
the
last
question
i
think
you
can
answer
that
also
if
you
will
saying
which
he
quietly
replaced
the
scrap
of
paper
in
his
i
followed
the
action
with
my
eyes
i
caught
a
fresh
glimpse
of
a
darkened
edge
and
realised
the
cause
of
the
faint
odour
which
i
had
hitherto
experienced
without
being
conscious
of
it
the
scrap
had
been
plucked
out
of
the
chimney
she
had
tried
to
burn
it
i
remembered
the
fire
and
the
smouldering
bits
of
paper
which
crumbled
at
my
touch
and
this
one
this
the
most
important
the
only
important
one
of
them
all
had
flown
up
the
chimney
and
clung
there
within
easy
reach
the
whole
incident
was
plain
to
me
and
i
could
even
fix
upon
the
moment
when
hexford
or
clarke
discovered
this
invaluable
bit
of
evidence
it
was
just
before
i
burst
in
upon
them
from
the
ballroom
and
it
was
the
undoubted
occasion
of
the
remark
i
then
overheard
settles
it
he
can
not
escape
us
during
the
momentary
silence
which
now
ensued
i
tried
to
remember
the
exact
words
which
had
composed
this
note
they
were
few
from
my
very
heart
i
ought
to
be
able
to
recollect
them
train
we
will
be
married
at
p
come
come
my
darling
my
life
she
will
forgive
when
all
is
done
hesitation
will
only
undo
us
at
do
not
fail
me
i
shall
never
marry
any
one
but
you
was
that
all
i
had
an
indistinct
remembrance
of
having
added
some
wild
and
incoherent
words
of
passionate
affection
affixed
to
her
name
but
it
may
be
that
in
the
hurry
and
flurry
of
the
moment
these
terms
of
endearment
simply
passed
through
my
mind
and
found
no
expression
on
paper
i
could
not
be
sure
any
more
than
i
could
be
positive
from
the
half
glimpse
i
got
of
these
lines
which
portion
had
been
burned
off
the
top
in
which
the
word
occurred
or
the
final
words
emphasising
a
time
of
meeting
and
my
determination
to
marry
no
one
but
the
person
addressed
the
first
gone
the
latter
might
take
on
any
sinister
meaning
the
latter
gone
the
first
might
prove
a
safeguard
corroborating
my
statement
that
an
errand
had
taken
me
into
town
i
was
oppressed
by
the
uncertainty
of
my
position
even
if
i
carried
off
this
detail
successfully
others
of
equal
importance
might
be
awaiting
explanation
my
poor
maddened
girl
had
made
the
irreparable
mistake
of
letting
this
note
of
mine
fly
unconsumed
up
the
chimney
and
she
might
have
made
others
equally
incriminating
it
would
be
hard
to
find
an
alibi
for
her
if
suspicion
once
turned
her
way
she
had
not
met
me
at
the
train
the
unknown
but
doubtless
man
who
had
handed
me
her
note
could
swear
to
that
fact
then
the
note
itself
i
had
destroyed
it
it
is
true
but
its
phrases
were
so
present
to
my
mind
had
been
so
branded
into
it
by
the
terrors
of
the
tragedy
which
they
appeared
to
foreshadow
that
i
had
a
dreadful
feeling
that
this
man
eye
could
read
them
there
i
remember
that
under
the
compelling
power
of
this
fancy
my
hand
rose
to
my
brow
outspread
and
concealing
as
if
to
interpose
a
barrier
between
him
and
them
is
my
folly
past
belief
possibly
but
then
i
have
not
told
you
the
words
of
this
fatal
communication
they
were
these
innocent
if
she
were
innocent
but
how
suggestive
in
the
light
of
her
probable
guilt
i
can
not
wait
till
then
you
will
see
the
depth
of
my
love
for
you
what
i
owe
you
what
i
owe
adelaide
i
should
see
i
was
seeing
suddenly
i
dropped
my
hand
a
new
thought
had
come
to
me
had
carmel
been
discovered
on
the
road
leading
from
this
place
you
perceive
that
by
this
time
i
had
become
the
prey
of
every
threatening
possibility
even
of
that
which
made
the
present
a
nightmare
from
which
i
should
yet
wake
to
old
conditions
and
old
struggles
bad
enough
god
knows
but
not
like
this
not
like
this
meantime
i
was
conscious
that
not
a
look
or
movement
of
mine
had
escaped
the
considerate
but
watchful
eye
of
the
man
before
me
you
do
not
relish
my
questions
he
dryly
observed
perhaps
you
would
rather
tell
your
story
without
interruption
if
so
i
beg
you
to
be
as
explicit
as
possible
the
circumstances
are
serious
enough
for
perfect
candour
on
your
part
he
was
wrong
they
were
too
serious
for
that
perfect
candour
would
involve
carmel
seeming
candour
was
all
i
could
indulge
in
i
took
a
quick
resolve
i
would
appear
to
throw
discretion
to
the
winds
to
confide
to
him
what
men
usually
hold
sacred
to
risk
my
reputation
as
a
gentleman
rather
than
incur
a
suspicion
which
might
involve
others
more
than
it
did
myself
perhaps
i
should
yet
win
through
and
save
her
from
an
ignominy
she
possibly
deserved
but
which
she
must
never
receive
at
my
hands
i
will
give
you
an
account
of
my
evening
said
i
it
will
not
aid
you
much
but
will
prove
my
good
faith
you
asked
me
a
short
time
ago
if
i
loved
the
lady
whom
i
was
engaged
to
marry
and
whose
dead
body
i
most
unexpectedly
came
upon
in
this
house
some
time
before
midnight
i
answered
yes
and
you
showed
that
you
doubted
me
you
were
justified
in
your
doubts
i
did
love
her
once
or
thought
so
but
my
feelings
changed
a
great
temptation
came
into
my
life
carmel
returned
from
school
and
you
know
her
beauty
her
fascination
a
week
in
her
presence
and
marriage
with
adelaide
became
impossible
but
how
evade
it
i
only
knew
the
coward
way
to
lure
this
inexperienced
young
girl
fresh
from
school
into
a
runaway
match
a
change
which
now
became
perceptible
in
miss
cumberland
manner
only
egged
me
on
it
was
not
sufficiently
marked
in
character
to
call
for
open
explanation
yet
it
was
unmistakable
to
one
on
the
watch
as
i
was
and
betokened
a
day
of
speedy
reckoning
for
which
i
was
little
prepared
i
know
what
the
manly
course
would
have
been
but
i
preferred
to
skulk
i
acknowledge
it
now
it
is
the
only
retribution
i
have
to
offer
for
a
past
i
am
ashamed
of
without
losing
one
particle
of
my
intention
i
governed
more
carefully
my
looks
and
actions
and
thought
i
had
succeeded
in
blinding
adelaide
to
my
real
feelings
and
purpose
whether
i
did
or
not
i
can
not
say
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
now
she
has
not
been
her
natural
self
for
these
last
few
days
but
she
had
other
causes
for
worry
and
i
have
been
willing
enough
to
think
that
these
were
the
occasion
of
her
restless
ways
and
short
sharp
speech
and
the
blankness
with
which
she
met
all
my
attempts
to
soothe
and
encourage
her
this
evening
i
choked
at
the
word
the
day
had
been
one
string
of
extraordinary
experiences
accumulating
in
intensity
to
the
one
ghastly
discovery
which
had
overtopped
and
overwhelmed
all
the
rest
this
evening
i
falteringly
continued
i
had
set
as
the
limit
to
my
endurance
of
the
intolerable
situation
during
a
minute
of
solitude
preceding
the
dinner
at
miss
cumberland
house
on
the
hill
i
wrote
a
few
lines
to
her
sister
urging
her
to
trust
me
with
her
fate
and
meet
me
at
the
station
in
time
for
the
train
i
meant
to
carry
her
at
once
to
p
where
i
had
a
friend
in
the
ministry
who
would
at
once
unite
us
in
marriage
i
was
very
peremptory
for
my
nerves
were
giving
way
under
the
secret
strain
to
which
they
had
been
subjected
for
so
long
and
she
herself
was
looking
worn
with
her
own
silent
and
uncommunicated
conflict
to
write
this
note
was
easy
but
to
deliver
it
involved
difficulties
miss
cumberland
eyes
seemed
to
be
more
upon
me
than
usual
mine
were
obliged
to
respond
and
carmel
seeing
this
kept
hers
on
her
plate
or
on
the
one
other
person
seated
at
the
table
her
brother
arthur
but
the
opportunity
came
as
we
all
rose
and
passed
together
into
the
carmel
fell
into
place
at
my
side
and
i
slipped
the
note
into
her
hand
she
had
not
expected
it
and
i
fear
that
the
action
was
observed
for
when
i
took
my
leave
of
miss
cumberland
shortly
after
i
was
struck
by
her
expression
i
had
never
seen
such
a
look
on
her
face
before
nor
can
i
conceive
of
one
presenting
a
more
extraordinary
contrast
to
the
few
and
commonplace
words
with
which
she
bade
me
good
evening
i
could
not
forget
that
look
i
continued
to
see
those
pinched
features
and
burning
eyes
all
the
way
home
where
i
went
to
get
my
and
i
saw
them
all
the
way
to
the
station
though
my
thoughts
were
with
her
sister
and
the
joys
i
had
planned
for
myself
egotism
perry
i
neither
knew
adelaide
nor
did
i
know
the
girl
whose
love
i
had
so
she
failed
me
perry
i
was
met
at
the
station
not
by
herself
but
by
a
letter
a
few
hurried
lines
given
me
by
an
unknown
man
in
which
she
stated
that
i
had
asked
too
much
of
her
that
she
could
not
so
wrong
her
sister
who
had
brought
her
up
and
done
everything
for
her
since
her
mother
died
i
have
not
that
letter
now
or
i
would
show
it
to
you
in
my
raging
disappointment
i
tore
it
up
on
the
place
where
i
received
it
and
threw
the
pieces
away
i
had
staked
my
whole
future
on
one
desperate
throw
and
i
had
lost
if
i
had
had
a
pistol
i
stopped
warned
by
an
uneasy
movement
on
the
part
of
the
man
i
addressed
that
i
had
better
not
dilate
too
much
upon
my
feelings
indeed
i
had
forgotten
to
whom
i
was
talking
i
realised
nothing
thought
of
nothing
but
the
misery
i
was
describing
his
action
recalled
me
to
the
infinitely
deeper
misery
of
my
present
situation
and
conscious
of
the
conclusions
which
might
be
drawn
from
such
impulsive
utterances
i
pulled
myself
together
and
proceeded
to
finish
my
story
with
greater
directness
i
did
not
leave
the
station
till
the
train
had
gone
i
had
hopes
still
of
seeing
her
or
possibly
i
dreaded
the
long
ride
back
to
my
apartments
it
was
from
sheer
preoccupation
of
mind
that
i
drove
this
way
instead
of
straight
out
by
marshall
avenue
i
had
no
intention
of
stopping
here
the
was
formally
closed
yesterday
as
you
may
know
and
i
did
not
even
have
the
keys
with
me
but
as
i
reached
the
bend
in
the
road
where
you
get
your
first
sight
of
the
buildings
i
saw
a
thin
streak
of
smoke
rising
from
one
of
its
chimneys
and
anxious
as
to
its
meaning
i
drove
in
wait
ranelagh
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you
but
by
which
gate
did
you
enter
by
the
lower
one
was
it
snowing
at
this
time
not
yet
it
was
just
before
the
clouds
rushed
upon
the
moon
i
could
see
everything
quite
plainly
my
companion
nodded
and
i
went
breathlessly
on
any
question
of
his
staggered
me
i
was
so
ignorant
of
the
facts
at
his
command
of
the
facts
at
any
one
command
outside
my
own
experience
and
observation
that
the
simplest
admission
i
made
might
lead
directly
to
some
clew
of
whose
very
existence
i
was
unaware
i
was
not
even
able
to
conjecture
by
what
chance
or
at
whose
suggestion
the
police
had
raided
the
place
and
discovered
the
tragedy
which
had
given
point
to
that
raid
no
one
had
told
me
and
i
had
met
with
no
encouragement
to
ask
i
felt
myself
sliding
amid
pitfalls
my
own
act
might
precipitate
the
very
doom
i
sought
to
avert
yet
i
must
preserve
my
and
answer
all
questions
as
truthfully
as
possible
lest
i
stumble
into
a
web
from
which
no
skill
of
my
own
or
of
another
could
extricate
me
fastening
my
horse
to
one
of
the
pine
trees
in
the
thickest
clump
i
saw
he
is
there
now
i
suppose
i
crept
up
to
the
house
and
tried
the
door
it
was
on
the
latch
and
i
stole
in
there
was
no
light
on
the
lower
floor
and
after
listening
for
any
signs
of
life
i
began
to
feel
my
way
about
the
house
searching
for
the
intruder
as
i
did
not
wish
to
attract
attention
to
myself
i
took
off
my
shoes
i
went
through
the
lower
rooms
and
then
i
came
upstairs
it
was
some
time
before
i
reached
the
the
room
where
a
fire
had
been
lit
but
when
i
did
i
knew
not
i
hastily
corrected
as
i
caught
his
quick
concentrated
glance
what
had
happened
or
whom
i
should
find
there
but
that
this
was
the
spot
where
the
intruder
had
been
possibly
was
now
and
i
determined
to
grapple
with
him
what
what
have
i
said
i
asked
in
anguish
as
i
caught
a
look
on
the
coroner
face
of
irrepressible
repulsion
and
disgust
slight
and
soon
gone
but
unmistakable
so
long
as
it
lasted
nothing
he
replied
go
on
but
his
tone
considerate
as
it
had
been
from
the
first
did
not
deceive
me
i
knew
that
i
had
been
detected
in
some
slip
or
prevarication
as
i
had
omitted
all
mention
of
the
most
serious
part
of
my
adventure
had
said
nothing
of
my
vision
of
carmel
or
the
terrible
conclusions
which
her
presence
there
had
awakened
my
conscience
was
in
a
state
of
perturbation
which
added
greatly
to
my
confusion
for
a
moment
i
did
not
know
where
i
stood
and
i
am
afraid
i
betrayed
a
sense
of
my
position
he
had
to
recall
me
to
myself
by
an
unimportant
question
or
two
before
i
could
go
on
when
i
did
proceed
it
was
with
less
connection
of
ideas
and
a
haste
in
speaking
which
was
not
due
altogether
to
the
harrowing
nature
of
the
tale
itself
i
had
matches
in
my
pocket
and
i
struck
one
i
began
afterwards
i
lit
the
candle
the
emptiness
of
the
room
did
not
alarm
me
i
experienced
the
sense
of
tragedy
seeing
the
pillows
heaped
high
and
too
regularly
for
chance
along
a
lounge
ordinarily
holding
only
two
i
tore
them
off
i
saw
a
foot
a
hand
a
tress
of
bright
hair
even
then
i
did
not
think
of
why
should
i
not
till
i
uncovered
the
face
did
i
know
the
terrors
of
my
discovery
and
then
the
confusion
of
it
all
unmanned
me
and
i
fell
on
my
knees
go
on
go
on
the
impetuosity
the
suspense
in
the
words
astounded
me
i
stared
at
the
coroner
and
lost
the
thread
of
my
story
what
had
i
to
say
more
how
account
for
what
must
be
ever
unaccountable
to
him
to
the
world
to
my
own
self
if
in
obedience
to
the
demands
of
the
situation
i
subdued
my
own
memory
and
blotted
out
all
i
had
seen
but
that
which
it
was
safe
to
confess
to
there
is
no
more
to
say
i
murmured
the
horror
of
that
moment
made
a
chaos
in
my
mind
i
looked
at
the
dead
body
of
her
who
lay
there
as
i
have
looked
at
everything
since
as
i
looked
at
the
police
when
they
came
as
i
look
at
you
now
but
i
know
nothing
it
is
all
a
phantasmagoria
to
me
with
no
more
meaning
than
a
nightmare
she
is
dead
i
know
that
but
beyond
that
all
is
doubt
confusion
what
the
world
and
all
its
passing
show
is
to
a
blind
man
i
can
neither
understand
nor
explain
vi
comments
and
reflections
there
is
no
agony
and
no
solace
left
earth
can
console
heaven
can
torment
no
more
the
coroner
intent
look
which
had
more
or
less
sustained
me
through
this
ordeal
remained
fixed
upon
my
face
as
though
he
were
still
anxious
to
see
me
exonerate
myself
how
much
did
he
know
that
was
the
question
much
did
he
having
no
means
of
telling
i
was
forced
to
keep
silent
i
had
revealed
all
i
dared
to
as
i
came
to
this
conclusion
his
eyes
fell
and
i
knew
that
the
favorable
minute
had
passed
the
question
he
now
asked
proved
it
you
say
that
you
were
not
blind
to
surrounding
objects
even
if
they
conveyed
but
little
meaning
to
you
you
must
have
seen
then
that
the
room
where
miss
cumberland
lay
contained
two
small
cordial
glasses
both
still
moist
with
some
liqueur
i
noticed
that
yes
some
one
must
have
drunk
with
her
i
can
not
contradict
you
was
miss
cumberland
fond
of
that
sort
of
thing
she
detested
liquor
of
all
kinds
she
never
drank
i
never
saw
a
woman
so
averse
to
wine
i
spoke
before
i
thought
i
might
better
have
been
less
emphatic
but
the
mystery
of
those
glasses
had
affected
me
from
the
first
neither
she
nor
carmel
ever
allowed
themselves
so
much
as
a
social
glass
yet
those
glasses
had
been
drained
perhaps
the
cold
there
was
a
third
glass
we
found
it
in
the
adjoining
closet
it
had
not
been
used
that
third
glass
has
a
meaning
if
only
we
could
find
it
out
a
possibility
which
had
risen
in
my
mind
faded
at
these
words
three
glasses
i
dully
repeated
and
a
small
flask
of
cordial
the
latter
seems
pure
enough
i
can
not
understand
it
the
phrase
had
become
stereotyped
no
other
suggested
itself
to
me
the
problem
would
be
simple
enough
if
it
were
not
for
on
her
neck
you
saw
those
too
i
take
it
yes
who
made
them
what
man
the
lie
or
rather
the
suggestion
of
a
lie
flushed
my
face
i
was
conscious
of
this
but
it
did
not
trouble
me
i
was
panting
for
relief
i
could
not
rest
till
i
knew
the
nature
of
the
doubt
in
this
man
mind
if
these
words
or
any
words
i
could
use
would
serve
to
surprise
his
secret
then
welcome
the
lie
or
suggestion
of
a
lie
it
was
a
act
i
went
on
bungling
with
my
sentences
in
anxiety
to
see
if
my
conclusions
fitted
in
with
his
own
was
the
do
you
know
dr
perry
there
were
three
glasses
in
those
rooms
only
two
were
drank
from
he
answered
steadily
tomorrow
i
may
be
in
a
position
to
answer
your
question
i
am
not
why
did
i
take
heart
not
a
change
not
the
flicker
of
one
had
passed
over
his
countenance
at
my
utterance
of
the
word
either
his
official
habit
had
stood
him
in
wonderful
stead
or
the
police
had
failed
so
far
to
see
any
connection
between
this
murder
and
the
young
girl
whose
footprints
for
all
i
knew
still
lingered
on
the
stairs
would
the
morrow
arm
them
with
completer
knowledge
as
i
turned
from
his
retreating
figure
and
flung
myself
down
before
the
hearth
this
was
the
question
i
continually
propounded
to
myself
in
vain
repetition
would
the
morrow
reveal
the
fact
that
adelaide
young
sister
had
been
with
her
in
the
hour
of
death
or
would
the
fates
propitiously
aid
her
in
preserving
this
secret
as
they
had
already
aided
her
in
selecting
for
the
one
man
who
shared
it
him
who
of
all
others
was
bound
by
honour
and
personal
consideration
for
her
not
to
divulge
what
he
knew
thus
the
hours
between
two
and
seven
passed
when
i
fell
into
a
fitful
sleep
from
which
i
was
rudely
wakened
by
a
loud
rattle
at
my
door
followed
by
the
entrance
of
the
officer
who
had
walked
up
and
down
the
corridor
all
night
the
waggon
is
here
said
he
breakfast
will
be
given
you
at
the
station
to
which
hexford
looking
over
his
shoulder
added
i
sorry
to
say
that
we
have
here
the
warrant
for
your
arrest
can
i
do
anything
for
you
warrant
i
burst
out
what
do
you
want
of
a
warrant
it
is
as
a
witness
you
seek
to
detain
me
i
presume
no
was
his
brusque
reply
the
charge
upon
which
you
are
arrested
is
one
of
murder
you
will
have
to
appear
before
a
magistrate
i
sorry
to
be
the
one
to
tell
you
this
but
the
evidence
against
you
is
very
strong
and
the
police
must
do
their
duty
but
i
am
innocent
absolutely
innocent
i
protested
the
perspiration
starting
from
every
pore
as
the
full
meaning
of
the
charge
burst
upon
me
what
i
have
told
you
was
correct
i
myself
found
her
dead
hexford
gave
me
a
look
do
talk
he
kindly
suggested
leave
that
to
the
lawyers
then
as
the
other
man
turned
aside
for
a
moment
he
whispered
in
my
ear
it
no
go
one
of
our
men
saw
you
with
your
fingers
on
her
throat
he
had
clambered
into
a
pine
tree
and
the
shade
of
the
window
was
up
you
had
better
come
quietly
not
a
soul
believes
you
innocent
this
then
was
what
had
doomed
me
from
the
start
this
and
that
partly
burned
letter
i
understood
now
why
the
coroner
who
loved
my
father
had
urged
me
to
tell
my
tale
hoping
that
i
would
explain
this
act
and
give
him
some
opportunity
to
indulge
in
a
doubt
and
i
had
failed
to
respond
to
the
hint
he
had
given
me
the
act
itself
must
appear
so
sinister
and
the
impulse
which
drove
me
to
it
so
incomprehensible
without
the
explanation
i
dare
not
subjoin
that
i
never
questioned
the
wisdom
of
silence
in
its
regard
yet
this
silence
had
undone
me
i
had
been
seen
fingering
my
dead
betrothed
throat
and
nothing
i
could
now
say
or
do
would
ever
convince
people
that
she
was
dead
before
my
hands
touched
her
strangled
by
another
clutch
one
person
only
in
the
whole
world
would
know
and
feel
how
false
this
accusation
was
and
yesterday
that
one
trust
in
my
guiltlessness
would
have
thrown
a
ray
of
light
upon
the
deepest
infamy
which
could
befall
me
but
there
had
settled
over
that
once
innocent
spirit
a
cloud
of
too
impenetrable
a
nature
for
any
light
to
struggle
to
and
fro
between
us
i
could
not
contemplate
that
cloud
i
could
not
dwell
upon
her
misery
or
upon
the
revulsion
of
feeling
which
follows
such
impetuous
acts
and
it
had
been
an
impetuous
act
the
result
of
one
of
her
rages
i
had
been
told
of
these
rages
i
had
even
seen
her
in
one
when
they
passed
she
was
her
lovable
self
once
more
and
very
penitent
and
very
downcast
if
all
i
feared
were
true
she
was
suffering
acutely
now
but
i
gave
no
thought
to
this
i
could
dream
of
but
one
thing
how
to
save
her
from
the
penalty
of
crime
a
penalty
i
might
be
forced
to
suffer
myself
and
would
prefer
to
suffer
rather
than
see
it
fall
upon
one
so
young
and
so
angelically
beautiful
turning
to
the
officer
next
me
i
put
the
question
which
had
been
burning
in
my
mind
for
hours
tell
me
how
you
came
to
know
there
was
trouble
here
what
brought
you
to
this
house
there
can
be
nothing
wrong
in
telling
me
that
well
if
you
do
know
he
began
i
do
not
i
broke
in
i
guess
you
better
wait
till
the
chief
has
had
a
word
with
you
i
suppressed
all
tokens
of
my
disappointment
and
by
a
not
unnatural
reaction
perhaps
began
to
take
in
and
busy
myself
with
the
very
considerations
i
had
hitherto
shunned
where
was
carmel
and
how
was
she
enduring
these
awful
hours
had
repentance
come
and
with
it
a
desire
to
own
her
guilt
did
she
think
of
me
and
the
effect
this
death
would
have
upon
my
feelings
that
i
should
suffer
arrest
for
her
crime
could
not
have
entered
her
mind
i
had
seen
her
but
she
had
not
seen
me
in
the
dark
hall
which
i
must
now
traverse
as
a
prisoner
and
a
suspect
no
intimation
of
my
dubious
position
or
its
inevitable
consequences
had
reached
her
yet
when
it
did
what
would
she
do
i
did
not
know
her
well
enough
to
tell
the
attraction
she
had
felt
for
me
had
not
been
strong
enough
to
lead
her
to
accommodate
herself
to
my
wishes
and
marry
me
but
it
had
been
strong
enough
to
nerve
her
arm
in
whatever
altercation
she
may
have
had
with
her
sister
it
was
the
temper
and
not
the
strength
of
the
love
which
would
tell
in
a
strait
like
this
would
it
prove
of
a
generous
kind
should
i
have
to
combat
her
desire
to
take
upon
herself
the
full
blame
of
her
deed
with
all
its
shames
and
penalties
or
should
i
have
the
still
deeper
misery
of
finding
her
callous
to
my
position
and
welcoming
any
chance
which
diverted
suspicion
from
herself
either
supposition
might
be
possible
according
to
my
judgment
in
this
evil
hour
all
communication
between
us
in
spite
of
our
ardent
and
ungovernable
passion
had
been
so
casual
and
so
slight
looks
a
whispered
word
or
so
one
furtive
clasp
in
which
our
hands
seemed
to
grow
together
were
all
i
had
to
go
upon
as
tests
of
her
feeling
towards
me
her
character
i
had
judged
from
her
face
which
was
lovely
but
faces
deceive
and
the
loveliness
of
youth
is
not
like
the
loveliness
of
age
an
absolute
mirror
of
the
soul
within
was
not
medusa
captivating
for
all
her
snaky
locks
hide
those
locks
and
one
might
have
thought
her
a
daphne
what
would
relieve
my
doubts
as
hexford
drew
near
me
again
on
our
way
to
the
head
of
the
staircase
i
summoned
up
courage
to
ask
have
you
heard
anything
from
the
hill
has
the
news
of
this
tragedy
been
communicated
to
miss
cumberland
family
and
if
so
how
are
they
bearing
this
affliction
his
lip
curled
and
for
a
minute
he
hesitated
then
something
in
my
aspect
or
the
look
i
gave
him
softened
him
and
he
answered
frankly
if
coldly
word
has
gone
there
of
course
but
only
the
servants
are
affected
by
it
so
far
miss
cumberland
the
younger
is
very
ill
and
the
boy
i
do
know
his
name
has
not
shown
up
since
last
evening
he
very
dissipated
they
say
and
may
be
in
any
one
of
the
joints
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
i
stopped
in
dismay
clutching
wildly
at
the
railing
of
the
stairs
we
were
descending
i
had
hardly
heard
the
latter
words
all
my
mind
was
on
what
he
had
said
first
miss
carmel
cumberland
ill
i
stammered
too
ill
to
be
told
i
was
sufficiently
master
of
myself
to
put
it
this
way
yes
he
rejoined
kindly
as
he
urged
me
down
the
very
stairs
i
had
seen
her
descend
in
such
a
state
of
mind
a
few
hours
before
a
servant
who
had
been
out
late
heard
the
fall
of
some
heavy
body
as
she
was
passing
miss
cumberland
rooms
and
rushing
in
found
miss
carmel
as
she
called
her
lying
on
the
floor
near
the
open
fire
her
face
had
struck
the
bars
of
the
grate
in
falling
and
she
was
badly
burned
but
that
was
not
all
she
was
delirious
with
fever
brought
on
they
think
by
anxiety
about
her
sister
whose
name
she
was
constantly
repeating
they
had
a
doctor
for
her
and
the
whole
house
was
up
before
ever
the
word
came
of
what
had
happened
here
i
thanked
him
with
a
look
i
had
no
opportunity
for
more
half
a
dozen
officers
were
standing
about
the
front
door
and
in
another
moment
i
was
bustled
into
the
conveyance
provided
and
was
being
driven
away
from
the
spot
i
had
heard
the
last
whisper
of
those
pines
for
many
many
days
but
not
in
my
dreams
it
ever
came
back
at
night
sinister
awesome
haunted
with
dead
hopes
and
breathing
of
an
ever
doubtful
future
vii
clifton
accepts
my
case
this
hand
of
mine
is
yet
a
maiden
and
an
innocent
hand
not
painted
with
the
crimson
spots
of
blood
within
this
bosom
never
enter
yet
the
dreadful
motion
of
a
thought
my
first
thought
when
i
could
think
at
all
was
this
she
has
some
feeling
then
her
terror
and
remorse
have
maddened
her
i
can
dwell
upon
her
image
with
pity
the
next
will
they
find
her
wet
clothes
and
discover
that
she
was
out
last
night
the
latter
possibility
troubled
me
my
mind
was
the
seat
of
strange
contradictions
as
the
day
advanced
and
i
began
to
realise
that
i
elwood
ranelagh
man
of
the
world
but
with
traditions
of
respectable
living
on
both
sides
of
my
house
and
a
list
of
friends
of
which
any
man
might
be
proud
was
in
a
place
of
detention
on
the
awful
charge
of
murder
i
found
that
my
keenest
torment
arose
from
the
fact
that
i
was
shut
off
from
the
instant
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
house
where
all
my
thoughts
my
fears
and
shall
i
say
it
latent
hopes
were
centred
to
know
carmel
ill
and
not
to
know
how
ill
to
feel
the
threatening
arm
of
the
law
hovering
constantly
over
her
head
and
neither
to
know
the
instant
of
its
fall
nor
be
given
the
least
opportunity
to
divert
it
to
realise
that
some
small
inadvertance
on
her
part
some
trivial
but
incriminating
object
left
about
some
heedless
murmur
or
burst
of
unconscious
frenzy
might
precipitate
her
doom
and
i
remain
powerless
bearing
my
share
of
suspicion
and
ignominy
it
is
true
but
not
the
chief
share
if
matters
befell
as
i
have
suggested
which
they
were
liable
to
do
at
any
hour
nay
at
any
minute
my
examination
before
the
magistrate
held
one
element
of
comfort
nothing
in
its
whole
tenor
went
to
show
that
as
yet
she
was
in
the
least
suspected
of
any
participation
in
my
crime
but
the
knowledge
which
came
later
of
how
the
police
first
learned
of
trouble
at
the
did
not
add
to
this
sense
of
relief
whatever
satisfaction
it
gave
my
curiosity
a
cry
of
distress
had
come
to
them
over
the
telephone
a
wild
cry
in
a
woman
choked
and
tremulous
voice
help
at
the
whispering
pines
help
that
was
all
or
all
they
revealed
to
me
in
their
endeavour
to
find
out
whether
or
not
i
was
present
when
this
call
was
made
i
learned
the
nature
of
their
own
suspicions
they
believed
that
adelaide
in
some
moment
of
prevision
had
managed
to
reach
the
telephone
and
send
out
this
message
but
what
did
i
believe
what
could
i
believe
all
the
incidents
of
the
deadly
struggle
which
must
have
preceded
the
fatal
culminating
act
were
mysteries
which
my
mind
refused
to
penetrate
after
hours
of
torturing
uncertainty
and
an
evening
which
was
the
miserable
precursor
of
a
still
more
miserable
night
i
decided
to
drop
conjecture
and
await
the
enlightenment
which
must
come
with
the
morrow
it
was
therefore
in
a
condition
of
mingled
dread
and
expectation
that
i
opened
the
paper
which
was
brought
me
the
next
morning
of
the
shock
which
it
gave
me
to
see
my
own
name
blotting
the
page
with
suggestions
of
hideous
crime
i
will
not
speak
but
pass
at
once
to
the
few
gleams
of
added
knowledge
i
was
able
to
gather
from
those
abominable
columns
arthur
the
brother
had
returned
from
his
wild
carouse
and
had
taken
affairs
in
charge
with
something
like
spirit
and
a
decent
show
of
repentance
for
his
own
shortcomings
and
the
mad
taste
for
liquor
which
had
led
him
away
from
home
that
night
carmel
was
still
ill
and
likely
to
be
so
for
many
days
to
come
her
case
was
diagnosed
as
one
of
brain
fever
and
of
a
most
dangerous
type
doctors
and
nurses
were
busy
at
her
bedside
and
little
hope
was
held
out
of
her
being
able
to
tell
soon
if
ever
what
she
knew
of
her
sister
departure
from
the
house
on
that
fatal
evening
that
her
testimony
on
this
point
would
be
invaluable
was
for
proofs
were
plenty
of
her
having
haunted
her
rooms
all
the
evening
in
a
condition
of
more
or
less
delirium
she
was
alone
in
the
house
and
this
may
have
added
to
her
anxieties
all
of
the
servants
having
gone
to
the
policemen
ball
it
was
on
their
return
in
the
early
morning
hours
that
she
had
been
discovered
lying
ill
and
injured
before
her
sister
fireplace
one
fact
was
mentioned
which
set
me
thinking
the
keys
of
the
had
been
found
lying
on
a
table
in
the
side
hall
of
the
cumberland
mansion
the
keys
which
i
have
already
mentioned
as
missing
from
my
pocket
an
alarming
discovery
which
might
have
acted
as
a
clew
to
the
suspicious
i
feared
if
their
presence
there
had
not
been
explained
by
the
waitress
who
had
cleared
the
table
after
dinner
coming
upon
these
keys
lying
on
the
floor
beside
one
of
the
chairs
she
had
carried
them
out
into
the
hall
and
laid
them
where
they
would
be
more
readily
seen
she
had
not
recognised
the
keys
but
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
they
belonged
to
ranelagh
who
had
dined
at
the
house
that
night
they
were
my
keys
and
i
have
already
related
how
i
came
to
drop
them
on
the
floor
had
they
but
stayed
there
adelaide
or
was
it
carmel
might
not
have
seen
them
and
been
led
by
some
strange
if
not
tragic
purpose
incomprehensible
to
us
now
and
possibly
never
to
find
full
explanation
to
enter
the
secret
and
forsaken
spot
where
i
later
found
them
the
one
dead
the
other
fleeing
in
frenzy
but
not
in
such
a
thoughtless
frenzy
as
to
forget
these
keys
or
to
fail
to
lock
the
door
behind
her
that
she
on
her
return
home
should
have
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
toss
these
keys
down
in
the
same
place
from
which
she
or
her
sister
had
taken
them
argued
well
for
her
up
to
that
moment
the
fever
must
have
come
on
later
a
fever
which
with
my
knowledge
of
what
had
occurred
at
the
whispering
pines
seemed
the
only
natural
outcome
of
the
situation
the
next
paragraph
detailed
a
fact
startling
enough
to
rouse
my
deepest
interest
zadok
brown
the
cumberlands
coachman
declared
that
cutter
and
what
he
called
the
grey
mare
had
been
out
that
night
they
were
both
in
place
when
he
returned
to
the
stable
towards
early
morning
but
the
signs
were
unmistakable
that
both
had
been
out
in
the
snow
since
he
left
the
stable
at
about
nine
he
had
locked
the
at
that
time
but
the
key
always
hung
in
the
kitchen
where
any
one
could
get
it
this
was
on
account
of
arthur
who
if
he
wanted
to
go
out
late
sometimes
harnessed
a
horse
himself
zadok
judged
that
he
had
done
so
this
night
though
how
the
horse
happened
to
be
back
and
in
her
stall
and
no
arthur
in
the
house
it
would
take
wiser
heads
than
his
to
explain
but
he
was
sure
the
mare
had
been
out
there
was
some
comment
made
on
this
because
arthur
had
denied
using
his
cutter
that
night
he
declared
instead
that
he
had
gone
out
on
foot
and
designated
the
coachman
tale
as
all
bosh
i
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
a
drop
too
much
was
the
dogged
assertion
with
which
he
met
all
questions
on
this
subject
i
would
give
a
snap
of
my
finger
for
zadok
opinion
on
any
subject
after
five
hours
of
dancing
and
the
necessary
drinks
there
were
no
signs
of
the
mare
having
been
out
when
i
got
home
as
this
was
about
noon
the
next
day
his
opinion
on
this
point
could
not
be
said
to
count
for
much
as
for
myself
i
felt
inclined
to
believe
that
the
mare
had
been
out
that
one
or
both
of
the
women
had
harnessed
him
and
that
it
was
by
these
means
they
had
reached
the
whispering
pines
the
night
was
too
cold
a
storm
too
imminent
for
them
to
have
contemplated
so
long
a
walk
on
a
road
so
remote
as
that
leading
to
the
arthur
was
athletic
but
adelaide
was
far
from
strong
and
never
addicted
to
walking
under
the
most
favourable
conditions
of
all
the
mysteries
surrounding
her
dead
presence
in
the
the
one
which
from
the
first
had
struck
me
as
the
most
inexplicable
was
the
manner
of
her
reaching
there
now
i
could
understand
both
that
fact
and
how
carmel
had
succeeded
in
returning
in
safety
to
her
home
she
had
ridden
both
ways
a
theory
which
likewise
explained
how
she
came
to
wear
a
man
derby
and
possibly
a
overcoat
with
her
skirts
covered
by
a
she
would
present
a
very
fair
figure
of
a
man
to
any
one
who
chanced
to
pass
her
this
was
desirable
in
her
case
a
man
and
woman
driving
at
a
late
hour
through
the
city
streets
would
attract
little
if
any
attention
while
two
women
might
having
no
wish
to
attract
attention
they
had
resorted
to
subterfuge
or
carmel
had
it
was
not
like
adelaide
to
do
so
she
was
always
perfectly
open
both
in
manner
and
speech
these
were
my
deductions
drawn
from
my
own
knowledge
would
others
who
had
not
my
knowledge
be
in
any
wise
influenced
to
draw
the
same
would
the
fact
that
the
mare
had
been
out
during
those
mysterious
hours
when
everybody
had
appeared
to
be
absent
from
the
house
saving
the
one
young
girl
whom
they
afterwards
found
stark
staring
mad
with
delirium
serve
to
awaken
suspicion
of
her
close
and
personal
connection
with
this
crime
there
was
nothing
in
this
reporter
article
to
show
that
such
an
idea
had
dawned
upon
his
mind
but
the
police
are
not
readily
hoodwinked
and
i
dreaded
the
result
of
their
inquiries
if
they
chose
to
follow
this
undoubted
clew
yet
if
they
let
this
point
slip
where
should
i
be
human
nature
is
human
all
the
way
through
and
i
could
not
help
having
moments
when
i
asked
myself
if
this
young
girl
were
worth
the
sacrifice
i
contemplated
making
for
her
she
was
lovely
to
look
at
amiable
and
of
womanly
promise
save
at
those
rare
and
poignant
moments
when
passion
would
seize
her
in
a
gust
which
drove
everything
before
it
but
were
any
of
these
considerations
sufficient
to
justify
me
in
letting
my
whole
manhood
slip
for
the
sake
of
one
who
whatever
the
provocation
had
used
the
strength
of
her
hands
against
the
sister
who
had
been
as
a
mother
to
her
for
so
many
years
that
she
had
had
provocation
i
did
not
doubt
adelaide
for
all
her
virtues
was
not
an
easy
person
to
deal
with
upright
and
perfectly
sincere
herself
she
had
no
sympathy
with
or
commiseration
for
any
lack
of
principle
or
any
display
of
selfishness
in
others
a
little
cold
a
little
reserved
a
little
lacking
in
spontaneity
though
always
correct
and
always
generous
in
her
gifts
and
often
in
her
acts
her
whole
nature
would
rise
at
any
evidence
of
meanness
or
ingratitude
and
though
she
said
little
you
would
feel
her
disapprobation
through
and
through
she
would
even
change
physically
naturally
pallid
and
of
small
inconspicuous
features
her
eyes
on
these
occasions
would
so
flame
and
her
whole
figure
so
dilate
that
she
looked
like
another
woman
i
have
seen
her
brother
six
feet
in
height
and
weighty
for
his
years
cringe
under
her
few
quiet
words
at
these
times
till
she
absolutely
seemed
the
taller
of
the
two
it
was
only
in
these
moments
she
was
handsome
and
had
i
loved
her
i
should
probably
have
admired
this
passionate
purity
this
intolerance
of
all
that
was
small
or
selfish
or
unworthy
a
good
esteem
but
not
loving
her
i
had
merely
cherished
a
wholesome
fear
of
her
displeasure
and
could
quite
comprehend
what
a
full
display
of
anger
on
her
part
might
call
up
in
her
sensitive
already
deeply
suffering
sister
the
scathing
arraignment
the
unbearable
taunt
well
well
it
was
all
but
i
had
time
to
dream
and
opportunity
for
little
else
and
pictures
which
till
now
i
had
sedulously
kept
in
the
background
of
my
imagination
would
come
to
the
front
as
i
harped
on
this
topic
and
weighed
in
my
disturbed
mind
the
following
question
should
i
continue
the
course
which
i
had
instinctively
taken
out
of
a
natural
sense
of
chivalry
or
face
my
calumniators
with
the
truth
and
leave
my
cause
and
hers
to
the
justice
of
men
rather
than
to
the
slow
but
righteous
workings
of
providence
i
struggled
with
the
dilemma
for
hours
the
more
so
that
i
did
not
stand
alone
in
the
world
i
had
relatives
and
i
had
friends
some
of
whom
had
come
to
see
me
and
gone
away
deeply
grieved
at
my
reticence
i
was
swayed
too
by
another
consideration
i
had
deeply
loved
my
mother
she
was
dead
but
i
had
her
honour
to
think
of
should
it
be
said
she
had
a
murderer
for
her
son
in
the
height
of
my
inner
conflict
i
had
almost
cried
aloud
the
fierce
denial
which
would
arise
at
this
thought
but
ere
the
word
could
leave
my
lips
such
a
vision
rose
before
me
of
a
bewildering
young
face
with
wonderful
eyes
and
a
smile
too
innocent
for
guile
and
too
loving
for
hypocrisy
that
i
forgot
my
late
antagonistic
feelings
forgot
the
claims
of
my
dear
dead
mother
and
even
those
of
my
own
future
such
passion
and
such
devotion
merited
consideration
from
the
man
who
had
called
them
forth
i
would
not
slight
the
claims
of
my
dead
mother
but
i
would
give
this
young
girl
a
chance
for
her
life
let
others
ferret
out
the
fact
that
she
had
visited
the
with
her
sister
i
would
not
proclaim
it
it
was
enough
for
me
to
proclaim
my
innocence
and
that
i
would
do
to
the
last
i
was
in
this
frame
of
mind
when
charles
clifton
called
and
was
allowed
to
see
me
i
had
sent
for
him
in
one
of
my
discouraged
moods
he
was
my
friend
but
he
was
also
my
legal
adviser
and
it
was
as
such
i
had
summoned
him
and
it
was
as
such
he
had
now
come
cordial
as
our
relations
had
been
though
he
was
hardly
one
of
my
ilk
i
noted
no
instinctive
outstretching
of
his
hand
and
so
did
not
reach
out
mine
appearances
had
been
too
strong
against
me
for
any
such
spontaneous
outburst
from
even
my
best
friends
i
realised
that
to
expect
otherwise
from
him
or
from
any
other
man
would
be
to
play
the
fool
and
this
was
no
time
for
folly
the
day
for
that
was
passed
i
was
the
first
to
speak
you
see
me
where
you
have
never
thought
to
see
a
friend
of
yours
but
we
wo
go
into
that
the
police
have
good
reasons
for
what
they
have
done
and
i
presume
feel
justified
in
my
commitment
notwithstanding
i
am
an
innocent
man
so
far
as
the
attack
made
upon
miss
cumberland
goes
i
had
no
hand
in
her
murder
if
murder
it
is
found
out
to
be
my
story
which
you
have
read
in
the
papers
and
which
i
felt
forced
to
give
out
possibly
to
my
own
shame
and
that
of
another
whom
i
would
fain
have
saved
is
an
absolutely
true
one
i
did
not
arrive
at
the
whispering
pines
until
after
miss
cumberland
was
dead
to
this
i
am
ready
to
swear
and
it
is
upon
this
fact
you
must
rely
in
any
defence
you
may
hereafter
be
called
upon
to
make
in
my
regard
he
listened
as
a
lawyer
would
be
apt
to
listen
to
such
statements
from
the
man
who
had
summoned
him
to
his
aid
but
i
saw
that
i
had
made
no
impression
on
his
convictions
he
regarded
me
as
a
guilty
man
and
what
was
more
to
the
point
no
doubt
as
one
for
whom
no
plea
could
be
made
or
any
rational
defence
undertaken
you
do
believe
me
i
went
on
still
without
any
great
bitterness
i
am
not
surprised
at
it
after
what
the
man
clarke
has
said
of
seeing
me
with
my
hands
on
her
throat
any
man
friend
or
not
would
take
me
for
a
villain
after
that
but
charles
to
you
i
will
confess
what
cowardice
kept
me
from
owning
to
perry
at
the
proper
possibly
at
the
only
proper
moment
that
i
did
this
out
of
a
wild
desire
to
see
if
those
marks
were
really
the
marks
of
strangling
fingers
i
could
not
believe
that
she
had
been
so
killed
and
led
away
by
my
doubts
i
leaned
over
her
and
you
shall
believe
me
you
must
i
insisted
as
i
perceived
his
hard
gaze
remain
unsoftened
i
do
ask
it
of
the
rest
of
the
world
i
hardly
expect
any
one
to
give
me
credit
for
good
impulses
or
even
for
speaking
the
plain
truth
after
the
discovery
which
has
been
made
of
my
treacherous
attitude
towards
these
two
virtuous
and
devoted
women
but
you
if
you
are
to
act
as
my
counsel
must
take
this
denial
from
me
as
gospel
truth
i
may
disappoint
you
in
other
ways
i
may
try
you
and
often
make
you
regret
that
you
undertook
my
case
but
on
this
fact
you
may
safely
pin
your
faith
she
was
dead
before
i
touched
her
had
the
police
spy
whose
testimony
is
likely
to
hang
me
climbed
the
tree
a
moment
sooner
than
he
did
he
would
have
seen
that
are
you
ready
to
take
my
case
clifton
is
a
fair
fellow
and
i
knew
if
he
once
accepted
the
fact
i
thus
urged
upon
him
he
would
work
for
me
with
all
the
skill
and
ability
my
desperate
situation
demanded
i
therefore
watched
him
with
great
anxiety
for
the
least
change
in
the
constrained
attitude
and
fixed
unpromising
gaze
with
which
he
had
listened
to
me
and
was
conscious
of
a
great
leap
of
heart
as
the
set
expression
of
his
features
relaxed
and
he
responded
almost
warmly
i
will
take
your
case
ranelagh
god
help
me
to
make
it
good
against
all
odds
i
was
conscious
of
few
hopes
but
some
of
the
oppression
under
which
i
laboured
lifted
at
those
words
i
had
assured
one
man
of
my
innocence
it
was
like
a
great
rock
in
the
weary
desert
my
sigh
of
relief
bespoke
my
feelings
and
i
longed
to
take
his
hand
but
the
moment
had
not
yet
come
something
was
wanting
to
a
perfect
confidence
between
us
and
i
was
in
too
sensitive
a
frame
of
mind
to
risk
the
slightest
rebuff
he
was
ready
to
speak
before
i
was
then
you
had
not
been
long
on
the
scene
of
crime
when
the
police
arrived
i
had
been
in
the
room
but
a
few
minutes
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
was
searching
the
house
the
police
say
that
fully
twenty
minutes
elapsed
between
the
time
they
received
miss
cumberland
appeal
for
help
and
their
arrival
at
the
if
you
were
there
that
long
i
can
not
say
moments
are
hours
at
such
a
crisis
i
my
emotions
were
too
much
for
me
and
i
confusedly
stopped
he
was
surveying
me
with
the
old
distrust
in
a
moment
i
saw
why
you
are
not
open
with
me
he
protested
why
should
moments
be
hours
to
you
previous
to
the
instant
when
you
stripped
those
pillows
from
the
couch
you
are
not
a
fanciful
man
nor
have
you
any
cowardly
instincts
why
were
you
in
such
a
turmoil
going
through
a
house
where
you
could
have
expected
to
find
nothing
worse
than
some
miserable
sneak
thief
this
was
a
poser
i
had
laid
myself
open
to
suspicion
by
one
thoughtless
admission
and
what
was
worse
it
was
but
the
beginning
in
all
probability
of
many
other
possible
mistakes
i
had
never
taken
the
trouble
to
measure
my
words
and
the
whole
truth
being
impossible
i
necessarily
must
make
a
slip
now
and
then
he
had
better
be
warned
of
this
i
did
not
wish
him
to
undertake
my
cause
blindfolded
he
must
understand
its
difficulties
while
believing
in
my
innocence
then
if
he
chose
to
draw
back
well
and
good
i
should
have
to
face
the
situation
alone
charles
said
i
as
soon
as
i
could
perfectly
control
my
speech
you
are
quite
just
in
your
remark
i
am
not
and
can
not
be
perfectly
open
with
you
i
shall
tell
you
no
lies
but
beyond
that
i
can
not
promise
i
am
caught
in
a
net
not
altogether
of
my
own
weaving
so
far
i
will
be
frank
with
you
a
common
question
may
trip
me
up
others
find
me
free
and
ready
with
my
defence
you
have
chanced
upon
one
of
the
former
i
was
in
a
turmoil
of
mind
from
the
moment
of
my
entrance
into
that
fatal
house
but
i
can
give
no
reason
for
it
unless
i
am
as
you
hinted
a
coward
he
settled
that
supposition
with
a
gesture
i
had
rather
not
have
seen
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
consider
me
a
poltroon
than
to
suspect
my
real
reasons
for
the
agitation
which
i
had
acknowledged
you
say
you
can
not
be
open
with
me
that
means
you
have
certain
memories
connected
with
that
night
which
you
can
not
divulge
right
charles
but
not
memories
of
guilt
of
active
guilt
i
mean
this
i
have
previously
insisted
on
and
this
is
what
you
must
believe
i
am
not
even
an
accessory
before
the
fact
i
am
perfectly
innocent
so
far
as
adelaide
death
is
concerned
you
may
proceed
on
that
basis
without
fear
that
is
if
you
continue
to
take
an
interest
in
my
case
if
not
i
shall
be
the
last
to
blame
you
little
honour
is
likely
to
accrue
to
you
from
defending
me
i
have
accepted
the
case
and
i
shall
continue
to
interest
myself
in
it
he
assured
me
with
a
dogged
rather
than
genial
persistence
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
i
am
to
work
upon
if
it
can
not
be
shown
that
her
call
for
help
came
before
you
entered
the
building
that
would
be
the
best
defence
possible
of
course
i
replied
but
neither
from
your
standpoint
nor
mine
is
it
a
feasible
one
i
have
no
proof
of
my
assertion
i
never
looked
at
my
watch
from
the
time
i
left
the
station
till
i
found
it
run
down
this
very
morning
the
clock
has
been
out
of
order
for
some
time
and
was
not
running
all
i
know
and
can
swear
to
about
the
length
of
time
i
was
in
that
building
prior
to
the
arrival
of
the
police
is
that
it
could
not
have
been
very
long
since
she
was
not
only
dead
and
buried
under
those
accumulated
cushions
but
in
a
room
some
little
distance
from
the
telephone
that
will
do
for
me
said
he
but
scarcely
for
those
who
are
prejudiced
against
you
everything
points
so
indisputably
to
your
guilt
the
note
which
you
say
you
wrote
to
carmel
to
meet
you
at
the
station
looks
very
much
more
like
one
to
miss
cumberland
to
meet
you
at
the
it
was
thus
i
first
learned
which
part
of
this
letter
had
been
burned
off
footnote
it
was
the
top
portion
leaving
the
rest
to
read
come
come
my
darling
my
life
she
will
forgive
when
all
is
done
hesitation
will
only
undo
us
at
i
shall
never
marry
any
one
but
you
it
was
also
evident
that
i
had
failed
to
add
those
expressions
of
affection
linked
to
carmel
name
which
had
been
in
my
mind
and
awakened
my
keenest
apprehension
otherwise
he
pursued
what
could
have
taken
her
there
everybody
who
knew
her
will
ask
that
such
a
night
so
soon
after
seeing
you
it
is
a
mystery
any
way
but
one
entirely
inconceivable
without
some
such
excuse
for
her
these
lines
said
and
she
went
for
reasons
which
may
be
clear
to
you
who
were
acquainted
with
her
weak
as
well
as
strong
points
went
how
no
one
knows
by
chance
or
by
intention
on
her
part
or
yours
every
servant
was
out
of
the
house
by
nine
and
her
brother
too
only
the
sister
remained
the
sister
whom
you
profess
to
have
urged
to
leave
the
town
with
you
that
very
evening
and
she
can
tell
us
nothing
may
die
without
ever
being
able
to
do
so
some
shock
to
her
feelings
you
may
know
its
character
and
you
may
not
drove
her
from
a
state
of
apparent
health
into
the
wildest
delirium
in
a
few
hours
it
was
not
your
letter
if
your
story
is
true
about
that
letter
or
she
would
have
shown
its
effect
immediately
upon
receiving
it
that
is
in
the
early
evening
and
she
did
not
helen
one
of
the
maids
declares
that
she
saw
her
some
time
after
you
left
the
house
and
that
she
wore
anything
but
a
troubled
look
that
in
fact
her
countenance
was
beaming
and
so
beautiful
that
accustomed
as
the
girl
was
to
her
young
good
looks
she
was
more
than
struck
by
her
appearance
and
spoke
of
it
afterwards
at
the
ball
a
telling
circumstance
against
you
ranelagh
not
only
contradicting
your
own
story
but
showing
that
her
after
condition
sprang
from
some
sudden
and
extreme
apprehension
in
connection
with
her
sister
did
you
speak
no
i
had
not
spoken
i
had
nothing
to
say
i
was
too
deeply
shaken
by
what
he
had
just
told
me
to
experience
anything
but
the
utmost
confusion
of
ideas
carmel
beaming
and
beautiful
at
an
hour
i
had
supposed
her
suffering
and
full
of
struggle
i
could
not
reconcile
it
with
the
letter
she
had
written
me
or
with
that
understanding
with
her
sister
which
ended
so
hideously
in
the
whispering
pines
the
lawyer
seeing
my
helpless
state
proceeded
with
his
presentation
of
my
case
as
it
looked
to
unprejudiced
eyes
miss
cumberland
comes
to
the
so
do
you
you
have
not
the
keys
and
so
go
searching
about
the
building
till
you
find
an
unlocked
window
by
which
you
both
enter
there
are
those
who
say
you
purposely
left
this
window
unfastened
when
you
went
about
the
house
the
day
before
that
you
dropped
the
keys
in
her
house
where
they
would
be
sure
to
be
found
and
drove
down
to
the
station
and
stood
about
there
for
a
good
half
hour
in
order
to
divert
suspicion
from
yourself
afterwards
and
create
an
alibi
in
case
it
should
be
wanted
i
do
not
believe
any
of
this
myself
not
since
accepting
your
assurance
of
innocence
but
there
are
those
who
do
believe
it
firmly
and
discern
in
the
whole
affair
a
cool
and
premeditated
murder
your
passion
for
carmel
while
not
generally
known
has
not
passed
unsuspected
by
your
or
her
intimates
and
this
in
itself
is
enough
to
give
colour
to
these
suspicions
even
if
you
had
not
gone
so
far
as
to
admit
its
power
over
you
and
the
extremes
to
which
you
were
willing
to
go
to
secure
the
wife
you
wished
so
much
for
the
situation
as
it
appears
to
outsiders
of
the
circumstantial
evidence
which
links
you
personally
to
this
crime
we
have
already
spoken
it
is
very
strong
and
apparently
unassailable
but
truth
is
truth
and
if
you
only
felt
free
to
bare
your
whole
soul
to
me
as
you
now
decline
to
do
i
should
not
despair
of
finding
some
weak
link
in
the
chain
which
seems
so
satisfactory
to
the
police
and
i
am
forced
to
add
to
the
general
public
charles
i
was
very
near
unbosoming
myself
to
him
at
that
moment
but
i
caught
myself
back
in
time
while
carmel
lay
ill
and
unconscious
i
would
not
clear
my
name
at
her
expense
by
so
much
as
a
suggestion
charles
i
repeated
but
in
a
different
tone
and
with
a
different
purpose
how
do
they
account
for
the
cordial
that
was
drunk
the
two
emptied
glasses
and
the
flask
which
were
found
in
the
adjacent
closet
it
one
of
the
affair
conceded
incongruities
miss
cumberland
is
a
temperance
woman
had
the
flask
and
glasses
not
come
from
her
house
you
would
get
no
one
to
believe
that
she
had
had
anything
to
do
with
them
have
you
any
hint
to
give
on
this
point
it
would
be
a
welcome
addition
to
our
case
alas
i
was
as
much
puzzled
by
those
emptied
cordial
glasses
as
he
was
and
told
him
so
also
by
the
presence
of
the
third
unused
one
as
i
dwelt
in
thought
on
the
latter
circumstance
i
remembered
the
observation
which
coroner
perry
had
made
concerning
it
coroner
perry
speaks
of
a
third
and
unused
glass
which
was
found
with
the
flask
i
ventured
tentatively
he
seemed
to
consider
it
an
important
item
hiding
some
truth
that
would
materially
help
this
case
what
do
you
think
or
rather
what
is
the
general
opinion
on
this
point
i
have
not
heard
i
have
seen
the
fact
mentioned
but
without
comment
it
is
a
curious
circumstance
i
will
make
a
note
of
it
you
have
no
suggestions
to
offer
on
the
subject
none
the
clew
is
a
small
one
he
smiled
so
is
the
one
offered
by
the
array
of
bottles
found
on
the
kitchen
table
yet
the
latter
may
lead
directly
to
the
truth
adelaide
never
dug
those
out
of
the
cellar
where
they
were
locked
up
and
i
sure
i
did
not
yet
i
suppose
i
given
credit
for
doing
so
naturally
the
key
to
the
was
the
only
key
which
was
lacking
from
the
bunch
left
at
miss
cumberland
that
it
was
used
to
open
the
door
is
evident
from
the
fact
that
it
was
found
in
the
lock
this
was
discouraging
everything
was
against
me
if
the
whole
affair
had
been
planned
with
an
intent
to
inculpate
me
and
me
only
it
could
not
have
been
done
with
more
attention
to
detail
nor
could
i
have
found
myself
more
completely
enmeshed
yet
i
knew
both
from
circumstances
and
my
own
instinct
that
no
such
planning
had
occurred
i
was
a
victim
not
of
malice
but
of
blind
chance
or
shall
i
say
of
providence
as
to
this
one
key
having
been
slipped
from
the
rest
and
used
to
open
the
for
wine
which
nobody
wanted
and
nobody
drank
this
must
be
classed
with
the
other
incongruities
which
might
yet
lead
to
my
enlargement
you
may
add
this
coincidence
to
the
other
i
conceded
after
i
had
gone
thus
far
in
my
own
mind
i
swear
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
key
neither
could
i
believe
that
it
had
been
used
or
even
carried
there
by
adelaide
or
carmel
though
i
knew
that
the
full
ring
of
keys
had
been
in
their
hands
and
that
they
had
entered
the
building
by
means
of
one
of
them
so
assured
was
i
of
their
innocence
in
this
regard
that
the
idea
which
afterwards
assumed
such
proportions
in
all
our
minds
had
at
this
moment
its
first
dawning
in
mine
as
well
as
its
first
outward
expression
some
other
man
than
myself
was
thirsty
that
night
i
firmly
declared
we
are
getting
on
charles
evidently
he
did
not
consider
the
pace
a
very
fast
one
but
being
a
cheerful
fellow
by
nature
he
simply
expressed
his
dissatisfaction
by
an
imperceptible
shrug
do
you
know
exactly
what
the
contained
he
asked
an
inventory
was
given
me
by
the
steward
the
morning
we
closed
it
must
be
in
my
rooms
your
rooms
have
been
examined
you
expected
that
did
you
probably
this
inventory
has
been
found
i
do
suppose
it
will
help
any
how
should
it
very
true
how
should
it
no
thoroughfare
there
of
course
no
thoroughfare
anywhere
i
exclaimed
some
of
escape
may
suggest
itself
to
me
i
should
like
to
sleep
on
the
matter
i
i
should
like
to
sleep
on
it
he
saw
that
i
had
something
in
mind
of
which
i
had
thus
far
given
him
no
intimation
and
he
waited
anxiously
for
me
to
reconsider
my
last
words
before
he
earnestly
remarked
a
day
lost
at
a
time
like
this
is
often
a
day
never
retrieved
think
well
before
you
bid
me
leave
you
unenlightened
as
to
the
direction
in
which
you
wish
me
to
work
but
i
was
not
ready
not
by
any
means
ready
and
he
detected
this
when
i
next
spoke
i
will
see
you
any
time
meantime
i
will
give
you
a
commission
which
you
are
at
liberty
to
perform
yourself
or
to
entrust
to
some
capable
detective
the
letter
of
which
a
portion
remains
written
to
carmel
and
she
sent
me
a
reply
which
was
handed
me
on
the
station
platform
by
a
man
who
was
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
i
have
hardly
any
memory
of
how
the
man
looked
but
it
should
be
an
easy
task
to
find
him
and
if
you
can
not
do
that
the
smallest
scrap
of
the
note
he
gave
me
and
which
unfortunately
i
tore
up
and
scattered
to
the
winds
would
prove
my
veracity
in
this
one
particular
and
so
make
it
easier
for
them
to
believe
the
rest
his
eye
lightened
i
presume
the
prospect
of
making
any
practical
attempt
in
my
behalf
was
welcome
one
thing
more
i
now
added
my
ring
was
missing
from
miss
cumberland
hand
when
i
took
away
those
pillows
i
have
reason
to
think
or
it
is
natural
for
me
to
think
that
she
planned
to
return
it
to
me
by
some
messenger
or
in
some
letter
do
you
know
if
such
messenger
or
such
letter
has
been
received
at
my
apartments
have
you
heard
anything
about
this
ring
it
was
a
notable
one
and
not
to
be
confounded
with
any
other
any
one
who
knew
us
or
who
had
ever
remarked
it
on
her
hand
would
be
able
to
identify
it
i
have
heard
the
ring
mentioned
he
replied
i
have
even
heard
that
the
police
are
interested
in
finding
it
but
i
have
not
heard
that
they
have
been
successful
you
encourage
me
much
by
assuring
me
that
it
was
missing
from
her
hand
when
you
first
saw
her
that
ring
may
prove
our
most
valuable
clew
yes
but
you
must
also
remember
that
she
may
have
taken
it
off
before
she
started
for
the
that
is
very
true
you
do
not
know
whether
they
have
looked
for
it
at
her
home
i
do
not
will
you
find
out
and
will
you
see
that
i
get
all
my
letters
i
certainly
will
but
you
must
not
expect
to
receive
the
latter
unopened
i
suppose
not
i
said
this
with
more
cheerfulness
than
he
evidently
expected
my
heart
had
been
lightened
of
one
load
the
ring
had
not
been
discovered
on
carmel
as
i
had
secretly
feared
i
will
take
good
care
of
your
interests
from
now
on
he
remarked
in
a
tone
much
more
natural
than
any
he
had
before
used
be
hopeful
and
show
a
brave
front
to
the
district
attorney
when
he
comes
to
interview
you
i
hear
that
he
is
expected
home
if
you
are
innocent
you
can
face
him
and
his
whole
office
with
calm
assurance
which
showed
how
little
he
understood
my
real
position
there
was
comfort
in
this
very
thought
however
and
i
quietly
remarked
that
i
did
not
despair
and
i
not
he
emphasised
rising
with
an
assumption
of
ease
which
left
him
as
he
remained
hesitating
before
me
it
was
my
moment
of
advantage
and
i
improved
it
by
proffering
a
request
which
had
been
more
or
less
in
my
mind
during
the
whole
of
this
prolonged
colloquy
first
thanking
him
for
his
disinterestedness
i
remarked
that
he
had
shown
me
so
much
consideration
as
a
lawyer
that
i
now
felt
emboldened
to
ask
something
from
him
as
my
friend
you
are
free
said
i
i
am
not
miss
cumberland
will
be
buried
before
i
leave
these
four
walls
i
hate
to
think
of
her
going
to
her
grave
without
one
token
from
the
man
to
whom
she
has
been
only
too
good
and
who
whatever
outrage
he
may
have
planned
to
her
feelings
is
not
without
reverence
for
her
character
and
a
heartfelt
repentance
for
whatever
he
may
have
done
to
grieve
her
charles
a
few
flowers
white
no
wreath
just
a
few
which
can
be
placed
on
her
breast
or
in
her
hand
you
need
not
say
whom
they
are
from
it
would
seem
a
mockery
to
any
one
but
her
lilies
charles
i
shall
feel
happier
to
know
that
they
are
there
will
you
do
this
for
me
i
will
that
is
all
instinctively
he
held
out
his
hand
i
dropped
mine
in
it
there
was
a
slight
pressure
some
few
more
murmured
words
and
he
was
gone
i
slept
that
night
viii
a
chance
i
take
it
i
entreat
you
then
from
one
that
so
imperfectly
conjects
you
take
no
notice
nor
build
yourself
a
trouble
out
of
his
scattering
and
unsure
observance
it
were
not
for
your
quiet
nor
your
good
nor
for
my
manhood
honesty
or
wisdom
to
let
you
know
my
thoughts
i
slept
though
a
question
of
no
small
importance
was
agitating
my
mind
demanding
instant
consideration
and
a
definite
answer
before
i
again
saw
this
friend
and
adviser
i
woke
to
ask
if
the
suggestion
which
had
come
to
me
in
our
brief
conversation
about
the
bottles
taken
from
the
was
the
promising
one
it
had
then
appeared
or
only
a
trick
bound
to
end
in
disaster
i
weighed
the
matter
in
every
conceivable
way
and
ended
by
trusting
to
the
instinct
which
impelled
me
to
have
resource
to
the
one
and
only
means
by
which
the
scent
might
be
diverted
from
its
original
course
confusion
be
sown
in
the
minds
of
the
police
and
carmel
as
well
as
myself
be
saved
from
the
pit
gaping
to
receive
us
this
was
my
plan
i
would
acknowledge
to
having
seen
a
horse
and
cutter
leave
the
by
the
upper
gateway
simultaneously
with
my
entrance
through
the
lower
one
i
would
even
describe
the
appearance
of
the
person
driving
this
cutter
no
one
by
the
greatest
stretch
of
imagination
would
be
apt
to
associate
this
description
with
carmel
but
it
might
set
the
authorities
thinking
and
if
by
any
good
chance
a
cutter
containing
a
person
wearing
a
derby
hat
and
a
coat
with
an
extra
high
collar
should
have
been
seen
on
this
portion
of
the
road
or
if
as
i
earnestly
hoped
the
snow
had
left
any
signs
of
another
horse
having
been
tethered
in
the
clump
of
trees
opposite
the
one
where
i
had
concealed
my
own
enough
of
the
truth
might
be
furnished
to
divide
public
opinion
and
start
fresh
inquiry
that
a
woman
form
had
sought
concealment
under
these
masculine
habiliments
would
not
could
not
strike
anybody
mind
nothing
in
the
crime
had
suggested
a
woman
presence
much
less
a
active
agency
on
the
contrary
all
the
appearances
save
such
as
i
believed
known
to
myself
alone
spoke
so
openly
of
a
man
strength
a
man
methods
a
man
appetite
and
a
man
brutal
daring
that
the
suspicion
which
had
naturally
fallen
on
myself
as
the
one
and
only
person
implicated
would
in
shifting
pass
straight
to
another
man
and
if
he
could
not
be
found
return
to
me
or
be
lost
in
a
maze
of
speculation
this
seemed
so
evident
after
a
long
and
close
study
of
the
situation
that
i
was
ready
with
my
confession
when
clifton
next
came
i
had
even
forestalled
it
in
a
short
interview
forced
upon
me
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
and
chief
hudson
that
it
had
made
an
altogether
greater
impression
upon
the
latter
than
i
had
expected
gave
me
additional
courage
when
i
came
to
discuss
this
new
line
of
defence
with
the
young
lawyer
i
was
even
able
to
tell
him
that
to
all
appearance
my
long
silence
on
a
point
so
favourable
to
my
own
interests
had
not
militated
against
me
to
the
extent
one
would
expect
from
men
so
alive
to
the
subterfuges
and
plausible
inventions
of
suspected
criminals
chief
hudson
believes
me
late
as
my
statement
is
i
saw
it
in
his
eye
thus
i
went
on
and
the
assistant
district
attorney
too
at
least
the
latter
is
willing
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
which
was
more
than
i
expected
what
do
you
suppose
has
happened
some
new
discovery
on
their
part
if
so
i
ought
to
know
what
it
is
believe
me
charles
i
ought
to
know
what
it
is
i
have
heard
of
no
new
discovery
he
coldly
replied
not
quite
pleased
as
i
could
see
either
with
my
words
or
my
manner
an
old
one
may
have
served
your
purpose
if
another
cutter
besides
yours
passed
through
the
grounds
at
the
time
you
mention
it
left
tracks
which
all
the
fury
of
the
storm
would
not
have
entirely
obliterated
in
the
fifteen
minutes
elapsing
between
that
time
and
the
arrival
of
the
police
perhaps
they
remember
these
tracks
and
if
you
had
been
entirely
frank
that
night
i
know
i
know
i
put
in
but
i
was
lay
it
to
my
confusion
of
mind
to
the
great
shock
i
had
received
to
anything
but
my
own
and
take
up
the
matter
as
it
now
stands
ca
you
follow
up
my
suggestion
a
witness
can
certainly
be
found
who
encountered
that
cutter
and
its
occupant
somewhere
on
the
long
stretch
of
open
road
between
the
whispering
pines
and
the
resident
district
possibly
it
would
help
you
have
not
asked
for
news
from
the
hill
the
trembling
which
seized
and
shook
me
at
these
words
testified
to
the
shock
they
gave
me
carmel
i
cried
she
is
worse
dead
no
she
not
worse
and
she
not
dead
but
the
doctors
say
it
will
be
weeks
before
they
can
allow
a
question
of
any
importance
to
be
put
to
her
you
can
see
what
that
will
do
for
us
her
testimony
is
too
important
to
the
case
to
be
ignored
a
delay
will
follow
which
may
or
may
not
be
favourable
to
you
i
am
inclined
to
think
now
that
it
will
redound
to
your
interests
you
are
ready
to
swear
to
the
sleigh
you
speak
of
that
you
saw
it
leave
the
grounds
and
turn
north
quite
ready
but
you
must
not
ask
me
to
describe
or
in
any
way
to
identify
its
occupant
i
saw
nothing
but
the
hat
and
coat
i
have
told
you
about
it
was
just
before
the
moon
went
under
a
cloud
or
i
could
not
have
seen
that
much
is
it
so
hard
to
preserve
a
natural
aspect
in
telling
or
suggesting
a
lie
that
charles
look
should
change
as
i
uttered
the
last
sentence
i
do
not
easily
flush
and
since
my
had
been
called
upon
by
the
dreadful
experiences
of
the
last
few
days
i
had
learned
to
conceal
all
other
manifestations
of
feeling
except
under
some
exceptional
shock
but
a
lie
embodied
in
so
many
words
never
came
easy
to
my
lips
and
i
suppose
my
voice
fell
for
his
glance
became
suddenly
penetrating
and
his
voice
slightly
sarcastic
as
he
remarked
those
clouds
obscured
more
than
the
moon
i
fancy
i
only
wish
that
they
had
not
risen
between
you
and
me
this
is
the
blindest
case
that
has
ever
been
put
in
my
hands
all
the
more
credit
to
me
if
i
see
you
through
it
i
suppose
but
tell
me
i
broke
in
with
equal
desire
to
cut
these
recriminations
short
and
to
learn
what
was
going
on
at
the
cumberland
house
have
you
been
to
the
hill
or
seen
anybody
who
has
ca
you
give
me
some
details
of
of
carmel
condition
of
the
sort
of
nurse
who
cares
for
her
and
how
arthur
conducts
himself
under
this
double
affliction
i
was
there
last
night
miss
clifford
was
in
the
house
and
received
me
she
told
me
that
arthur
state
of
mind
was
pitiful
he
was
never
a
very
affectionate
brother
you
know
but
now
they
can
not
get
him
away
from
carmel
door
he
sits
or
stands
all
day
just
outside
the
threshold
and
casts
jealous
and
beseeching
looks
at
those
who
are
allowed
to
enter
they
say
you
would
know
him
i
tried
to
get
him
to
come
down
and
see
me
but
he
would
leave
his
post
does
he
grieve
for
adelaide
i
always
thought
that
of
the
two
she
had
the
greater
influence
over
him
yes
but
they
can
not
get
him
to
enter
the
place
where
she
lies
his
duty
is
to
the
living
he
says
at
least
his
anxiety
is
there
he
starts
at
every
cry
carmel
utters
she
cries
out
then
very
often
i
could
hear
her
from
where
i
sat
downstairs
and
what
does
she
say
the
one
thing
constantly
lila
nothing
more
i
kept
my
face
in
shadow
if
he
saw
it
at
all
it
must
have
looked
as
cold
and
hard
as
stone
after
a
moment
i
went
on
with
my
queries
does
he
arthur
mention
me
at
all
i
did
not
discuss
you
greatly
with
miss
clifford
i
saw
that
she
was
prejudiced
and
i
preferred
not
to
risk
an
argument
but
she
let
fall
this
much
that
arthur
felt
very
hard
towards
you
and
loudly
insisted
upon
your
guilt
she
seemed
to
think
him
justified
in
this
you
mind
my
telling
you
it
is
better
for
you
to
know
what
is
being
said
about
you
in
town
i
understood
his
motive
he
was
trying
to
drive
me
into
giving
him
my
full
confidence
but
i
would
not
be
driven
i
simply
retorted
quietly
but
in
a
way
to
stop
all
such
future
attempts
miss
clifford
is
a
very
good
girl
and
a
true
friend
of
the
whole
cumberland
family
but
she
is
not
the
most
discriminating
person
in
the
world
and
even
if
she
were
her
opinion
would
not
turn
me
from
the
course
i
have
laid
out
for
myself
does
the
doctor
carpenter
i
presume
venture
to
say
how
long
carmel
present
delirium
will
hold
he
can
not
not
knowing
its
real
cause
carmel
fell
ill
before
the
news
of
her
sister
death
arrived
at
the
house
you
remember
some
frightful
scene
must
have
occurred
between
the
two
previous
to
departure
for
the
whispering
pines
what
that
scene
was
can
only
be
told
by
carmel
and
for
her
account
we
must
wait
happily
you
have
an
alibi
which
will
serve
you
in
this
instance
you
were
at
the
station
during
the
time
we
are
speaking
of
has
that
been
proved
yes
several
men
saw
you
there
and
the
gentleman
who
brought
me
the
her
letter
it
was
more
than
difficult
for
me
to
speak
carmel
name
he
has
not
come
forward
not
yet
not
to
my
knowledge
at
least
and
the
ring
no
news
the
nurse
you
have
told
me
nothing
about
her
i
now
urged
reverting
to
the
topic
of
gravest
interest
to
me
is
she
any
one
we
know
or
an
importation
of
the
doctor
i
did
not
busy
myself
with
that
she
a
competent
woman
of
course
i
suppose
that
is
what
you
mean
could
i
tell
him
that
this
was
not
what
i
meant
at
all
that
it
was
her
qualities
as
woman
rather
than
her
qualifications
as
nurse
which
were
important
in
this
case
if
she
were
of
a
suspicious
prying
disposition
given
to
weighing
every
word
and
marking
every
gesture
of
a
delirious
patient
what
might
we
not
fear
from
her
circumspection
when
carmel
memory
asserted
itself
and
she
grew
more
precise
in
the
frenzy
which
now
exhausted
itself
in
unintelligible
cries
or
the
ceaseless
repetition
of
her
sister
name
the
question
seemed
of
such
importance
to
me
that
i
was
tempted
to
give
expression
to
my
secret
apprehension
on
this
score
but
i
bethought
myself
in
time
and
passed
the
matter
over
with
the
final
remark
watch
her
watch
them
all
and
bring
me
each
and
every
detail
of
the
poor
girl
sickness
you
will
never
regret
humouring
me
in
this
you
ordered
the
flowers
for
adelaide
yes
lilies
as
you
requested
a
short
silence
then
i
observed
there
will
be
no
autopsy
the
papers
say
the
evidences
of
death
by
strangulation
are
too
well
defined
very
true
yet
i
wonder
at
their
laxity
in
this
there
were
signs
of
some
other
agency
having
been
at
work
also
those
two
empty
glasses
smelling
of
cordial
innocent
perhaps
yet
do
i
can
bear
no
more
i
shall
be
stronger
another
feeler
turned
aside
his
cheek
showed
his
displeasure
but
the
words
were
kind
enough
with
which
he
speedily
took
his
leave
and
left
me
to
solitude
and
a
long
night
of
maddening
thought
book
two
sweetwater
to
the
front
ix
we
know
of
no
such
letter
o
he
sits
high
in
all
the
people
hearts
and
that
which
would
appear
offence
in
us
his
countenance
like
richest
alchemy
will
change
to
virtue
and
to
worthiness
and
you
still
hold
him
yes
but
with
growing
uncertainty
he
one
of
those
fellows
who
affect
your
judgment
in
spite
of
yourself
handsome
beyond
the
ordinary
a
finished
gentleman
and
all
that
he
has
in
addition
to
these
advantages
a
way
with
him
that
goes
straight
to
the
heart
in
spite
of
prejudice
and
the
claims
of
conscience
that
a
dangerous
factor
in
a
case
like
this
it
hampers
a
man
in
the
exercise
of
his
duties
you
may
escape
the
fascination
probably
will
but
at
least
you
will
understand
my
present
position
and
why
i
telephoned
to
new
york
for
an
expert
detective
to
help
us
on
this
job
i
wish
to
give
the
son
of
my
old
friend
a
chance
the
man
whom
coroner
perry
thus
addressed
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
quietly
replied
you
right
not
because
he
the
son
of
your
old
friend
a
handsome
fellow
and
all
that
but
for
the
reason
that
every
man
should
have
his
full
chance
whatever
the
appearances
against
him
personally
i
have
no
fear
of
my
judgment
being
affected
by
his
attractions
i
had
to
do
with
too
many
handsome
scamps
for
that
but
i
shall
be
as
just
to
him
as
you
will
simply
because
it
seems
an
incredibly
brutal
crime
for
a
gentleman
to
commit
and
also
because
i
lay
greater
stress
than
you
do
on
the
two
or
three
minor
points
which
seem
to
favour
his
latest
declaration
that
a
man
had
preceded
him
in
his
visit
to
this
lonely
a
man
whom
he
had
himself
seen
leaving
the
grounds
in
a
cutter
just
as
he
entered
by
the
opposite
driveway
ah
came
in
quick
ejaculation
from
the
coroner
lips
i
like
to
hear
you
say
that
i
was
purposely
careful
not
to
lay
emphasis
on
the
facts
you
allude
to
i
wished
you
to
draw
your
own
inferences
without
any
aid
from
me
the
police
did
find
traces
of
a
second
horse
and
cutter
having
passed
through
the
grounds
it
was
snowing
hard
and
these
traces
were
speedily
obliterated
but
hexford
and
clarke
saw
them
in
time
to
satisfy
themselves
that
they
extended
from
the
northern
clump
of
trees
to
the
upper
gateway
where
they
took
the
direction
of
the
hill
that
is
not
all
a
packed
for
travelling
was
in
ranelagh
cutter
showing
that
his
story
of
an
intended
journey
was
not
without
some
foundation
yes
we
have
retained
that
it
is
not
the
only
proof
we
have
of
his
intention
to
leave
the
city
for
a
while
he
had
made
other
arrangements
business
arrangements
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
no
one
doubts
that
he
planned
an
elopement
with
the
beautiful
carmel
the
question
is
was
his
disappointment
followed
by
the
murder
of
the
woman
who
stood
in
his
way
district
attorney
fox
you
will
have
guessed
his
identity
before
now
took
his
time
deliberating
carefully
with
himself
before
venturing
to
reply
then
when
the
coroner
concealed
impatience
was
about
to
disclose
itself
he
quietly
remarked
i
suppose
that
no
conclusion
can
be
drawn
from
the
condition
of
the
body
when
our
men
reached
it
i
judge
that
it
was
still
warm
yes
but
so
it
would
have
been
if
she
had
met
her
fate
several
minutes
earlier
than
was
supposed
clarke
and
hexford
differ
about
the
length
of
time
which
intervened
between
the
moment
when
the
former
looked
into
the
room
from
the
outside
and
that
of
their
final
entrance
but
whether
it
was
five
minutes
or
ten
the
period
was
long
enough
to
render
their
testimony
uncertain
as
to
the
exact
length
of
time
she
had
lain
there
dead
had
i
been
there
but
it
useless
to
go
into
that
let
us
take
up
something
more
tangible
very
good
here
it
is
of
the
six
bottles
of
spirits
which
were
surreptitiously
taken
from
the
four
were
found
standing
unopened
on
the
kitchen
table
where
are
the
other
two
that
it
that
the
question
i
have
put
myself
ever
since
i
interrogated
the
steward
and
found
him
ready
to
swear
to
the
correctness
of
his
report
and
the
disappearance
of
these
two
bottles
ranelagh
did
not
empty
them
or
the
bottles
themselves
would
have
been
found
somewhere
about
the
place
now
who
did
no
one
within
the
precincts
they
were
opened
and
emptied
elsewhere
there
our
clew
and
if
the
man
you
got
up
from
new
york
is
worth
his
salt
he
has
his
task
ready
to
hand
a
hard
task
for
a
stranger
and
such
a
stranger
not
very
prepossessing
to
say
the
least
but
he
has
a
good
eye
and
will
get
along
with
the
boys
all
right
nothing
assertive
about
him
not
enough
go
perhaps
would
you
like
to
see
him
in
a
moment
i
want
to
clear
my
mind
in
reference
to
these
bottles
only
some
one
addicted
to
drink
would
drag
those
six
bottles
out
of
that
cold
unlighted
cellar
yes
and
a
connoisseur
at
that
the
two
missing
bottles
held
the
choicest
brand
in
the
whole
stock
they
were
kept
far
back
too
hidden
as
it
were
behind
the
other
bottles
yet
they
were
hauled
to
the
front
and
carried
off
as
you
say
and
by
some
one
who
knows
a
good
thing
in
spirits
what
was
in
the
four
bottles
found
on
the
kitchen
table
sherry
whiskey
and
rum
two
bottles
of
rum
and
one
each
of
sherry
and
whiskey
the
thief
meant
to
carry
them
all
off
but
had
not
time
the
thief
no
common
man
such
as
we
are
looking
for
would
make
choice
of
just
those
bottles
so
there
we
are
again
contradictions
in
every
direction
do
let
us
bother
with
the
contradictions
but
just
follow
the
clew
those
bottles
full
or
empty
must
be
found
you
know
the
labels
yes
and
the
shape
and
colour
of
the
bottles
both
of
which
are
peculiar
good
now
let
us
see
your
detective
but
sweetwater
was
not
called
in
yet
just
as
coroner
perry
offered
to
touch
his
bell
the
door
opened
and
clifton
was
ushered
in
well
and
favourably
known
to
both
men
he
had
no
difficulty
in
stating
his
business
and
preferring
his
request
i
am
here
in
the
interests
of
elwood
ranelagh
said
he
he
is
willing
to
concede
and
so
am
i
that
under
the
circumstances
his
arrest
was
justifiable
but
not
his
prolonged
detention
he
has
little
excuse
to
offer
for
the
mistakes
he
has
made
or
the
various
offences
of
which
he
has
been
guilty
his
best
friends
must
condemn
his
hypocrisy
and
treatment
of
miss
cumberland
but
he
vows
that
he
had
no
hand
in
her
violent
death
and
in
this
regard
i
feel
not
only
bound
but
forced
to
believe
him
at
all
events
i
am
going
to
act
on
that
conviction
and
have
come
here
to
entreat
your
aid
in
clearing
up
one
or
two
points
which
may
affect
your
own
opinion
of
his
guilt
as
his
counsel
i
have
been
able
to
extract
from
him
a
fact
or
two
which
he
has
hitherto
withheld
from
the
police
reticent
as
he
has
shown
himself
from
the
start
and
considering
the
character
of
the
two
women
involved
in
this
tragedy
this
can
not
be
looked
upon
as
entirely
to
his
discredit
he
has
confided
to
me
a
circumstance
which
in
the
excitement
attendant
on
miss
carmel
cumberland
sudden
illness
may
have
escaped
the
notice
of
the
family
and
very
naturally
of
the
police
it
is
this
the
ring
which
miss
cumberland
wore
as
the
sign
and
seal
of
her
engagement
to
him
was
not
on
her
hand
when
he
came
upon
her
as
he
declares
he
did
dead
it
was
there
at
a
curious
ring
which
i
have
often
noted
myself
and
could
accurately
describe
if
required
if
she
took
it
off
before
starting
for
the
whispering
pines
it
should
be
easily
found
but
if
she
did
not
what
a
clew
it
offers
to
her
unknown
assailant
up
till
now
ranelagh
has
been
anticipating
receiving
this
ring
back
in
a
letter
written
before
she
left
her
home
but
he
has
heard
of
no
such
letter
and
doubts
now
if
you
have
may
i
ask
if
he
is
correct
in
this
surmise
we
know
of
no
such
letter
none
has
come
to
his
rooms
replied
the
coroner
i
thought
not
the
whereabouts
of
this
ring
then
is
still
to
be
determined
you
will
pardon
my
having
called
your
attention
to
it
as
ranelagh
legal
adviser
i
am
very
anxious
to
have
that
ring
found
we
are
glad
to
receive
your
suggestion
replied
the
district
attorney
but
you
must
remember
that
some
of
its
force
is
lost
by
its
having
originated
with
the
accused
very
true
but
ranelagh
was
only
induced
to
speak
of
this
matter
after
i
had
worked
with
him
for
an
hour
there
is
a
mystery
in
his
attitude
which
i
for
one
have
not
yet
fathomed
you
must
have
noticed
this
also
coroner
perry
your
inquest
when
you
hold
it
will
reveal
some
curious
facts
but
i
doubt
if
it
will
reveal
the
secret
underlying
this
man
reticence
that
we
shall
have
to
discover
for
ourselves
he
has
another
secret
then
than
the
one
involving
his
arrest
as
a
suspected
murderer
was
the
subtle
conclusion
of
the
district
attorney
yes
or
why
does
he
balk
so
at
the
simplest
inquiries
i
have
my
notion
as
to
its
nature
but
i
not
here
to
express
notions
unless
you
call
my
almost
unfounded
belief
in
him
a
notion
what
i
want
to
present
to
you
is
fact
and
fact
which
can
be
utilised
in
the
cause
of
your
client
which
is
equally
the
cause
of
justice
possibly
we
search
for
the
ring
mr
clifton
meanwhile
will
you
cast
your
eye
over
these
fragments
of
a
note
which
ranelagh
says
he
received
from
miss
carmel
cumberland
while
waiting
on
the
station
platform
for
her
coming
taking
an
envelope
from
his
pocket
clifton
drew
forth
two
small
scraps
of
soiled
and
crumpled
paper
one
of
which
was
the
half
of
another
envelope
presenting
very
nearly
the
following
appearance
as
he
pointed
this
out
he
remarked
elwood
is
not
so
common
a
baptismal
name
that
there
can
be
any
doubt
as
to
the
person
addressed
the
other
scraps
also
written
in
pencil
and
by
the
same
hand
contained
but
two
or
three
disconnected
words
but
one
of
those
words
was
i
spent
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
yards
adjoining
the
station
before
i
found
those
two
bits
explained
the
young
lawyer
with
a
simple
earnestness
not
displeasing
to
the
two
seasoned
men
he
addressed
one
was
in
hiding
under
a
pile
of
outgoing
freight
and
the
other
i
picked
out
of
a
cart
of
stuff
which
had
been
swept
up
in
the
early
morning
i
offer
them
in
corroboration
of
ranelagh
statement
that
the
used
in
the
partially
consumed
letter
found
in
the
clubhouse
chimney
was
addressed
to
miss
carmel
cumberland
and
not
to
adelaide
and
that
the
place
of
meeting
suggested
by
this
word
was
the
station
platform
and
not
the
spot
since
made
terrible
by
death
you
are
acquainted
with
miss
carmel
cumberland
handwriting
if
i
am
not
the
town
is
full
of
people
who
are
i
believe
these
words
to
have
been
written
by
carmel
cumberland
fox
placed
the
pieces
back
in
their
envelope
and
laid
the
whole
carefully
away
for
a
second
time
we
are
obliged
to
you
said
he
you
can
cancel
the
obligation
was
the
quick
retort
by
discovering
the
identity
of
the
man
who
in
derby
hat
and
a
coat
with
a
very
high
collar
left
the
grounds
of
the
whispering
pines
just
as
ranelagh
drove
into
them
i
have
no
facilities
for
the
job
and
no
desire
to
undertake
it
he
had
endeavoured
to
speak
naturally
if
not
with
an
air
but
he
failed
somehow
else
why
the
quick
glance
of
startled
inquiry
which
perry
sent
him
from
under
his
rather
shaggy
eyebrows
well
we
undertake
that
too
promised
the
district
attorney
i
can
ask
no
more
returned
charles
clifton
arising
to
depart
the
confronting
of
that
man
with
ranelagh
will
cause
the
latter
to
unseal
his
lips
before
you
have
finished
with
my
client
you
will
esteem
him
much
more
highly
than
you
do
now
the
district
attorney
smiled
at
what
seemed
the
callow
enthusiasm
of
a
youthful
lawyer
but
the
coroner
who
knew
his
district
well
looked
very
thoughtfully
down
at
the
table
before
which
he
sat
and
failed
to
raise
his
head
until
the
young
man
had
vanished
from
the
room
and
his
place
had
been
taken
by
another
of
very
different
appearance
and
deportment
then
he
roused
himself
and
introduced
the
newcomer
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
as
caleb
sweetwater
of
the
new
york
police
department
caleb
sweetwater
was
no
beauty
he
was
to
the
point
of
ugliness
so
that
not
even
his
quick
whimsical
smile
could
make
his
face
agreeable
to
one
who
did
not
know
his
many
valuable
qualities
his
receding
chin
and
far
too
projecting
nose
were
not
likely
to
create
a
favourable
impression
on
one
ignorant
of
his
cheerful
modest
winsome
disposition
and
the
district
attorney
after
eyeing
him
for
a
moment
with
disfavour
abruptly
suggested
you
have
brought
some
credentials
with
you
i
hope
here
is
a
letter
from
one
of
the
department
gryce
wrote
it
he
added
with
just
a
touch
of
pride
the
letter
is
all
right
hastily
remarked
perry
on
looking
it
over
sweetwater
is
commended
to
us
as
a
man
of
sagacity
and
becoming
reserve
very
good
to
business
then
the
sooner
we
get
to
work
on
this
new
theory
the
better
sweetwater
we
have
some
doubts
if
the
man
we
have
in
hand
is
the
man
we
really
want
but
first
how
much
do
you
know
about
this
case
all
that
in
the
papers
nothing
more
very
little
i
not
been
in
town
above
an
hour
are
you
known
here
i
do
think
so
it
my
first
visit
this
way
then
you
are
as
ignorant
of
the
people
as
they
are
of
you
well
that
has
its
disadvantages
and
its
advantages
if
you
will
permit
me
to
say
so
sir
i
have
no
prejudices
no
preconceived
notions
to
struggle
against
i
can
take
persons
as
i
find
them
and
if
there
is
any
deep
family
secret
to
unearth
it
mighty
fortunate
for
a
man
to
have
nothing
stand
in
the
way
of
his
own
instincts
no
likings
i
mean
no
leanings
this
way
or
that
for
humane
or
other
purely
unprofessional
reasons
the
eye
of
district
attorney
fox
stole
towards
that
of
his
brother
official
but
did
not
meet
it
the
coroner
had
turned
his
attention
to
the
table
again
and
while
betraying
no
embarrassment
was
not
quite
his
usual
self
the
district
attorney
hand
stole
to
his
chin
which
he
softly
rubbed
with
his
lean
forefinger
as
he
again
addressed
sweetwater
this
tragedy
the
most
lamentable
which
has
ever
occurred
in
this
town
is
really
and
without
exaggeration
a
tragedy
in
high
life
the
lady
who
was
strangled
by
a
brute
clutch
was
a
woman
of
the
highest
culture
and
most
estimable
character
her
sister
who
is
supposed
to
have
been
the
unconscious
cause
of
the
crime
is
a
young
girl
of
blameless
record
of
the
man
who
was
seen
bending
over
the
victim
with
his
hands
on
her
throat
we
can
not
speak
so
well
he
has
the
faults
and
has
lived
the
life
of
a
social
favourite
gifted
in
many
ways
and
popular
with
both
men
and
women
he
has
swung
on
his
course
with
an
easy
disregard
of
the
claims
of
others
which
while
leaving
its
traces
no
doubt
in
many
a
humble
and
uncomplaining
heart
did
not
attract
notice
to
his
inherent
lack
of
principle
until
the
horrors
of
this
tragedy
lifted
him
into
public
view
stripped
of
all
his
charms
he
an
egotist
of
the
first
water
there
is
no
getting
over
that
but
did
he
strangle
the
woman
he
says
not
that
he
was
only
following
some
extraordinary
impulse
of
the
moment
in
laying
his
thumbs
on
the
marks
he
saw
on
miss
neck
a
fantastic
story
told
too
late
besides
for
perfect
credence
and
not
worthy
of
the
least
attention
if
the
reasons
which
followed
are
too
well
known
to
us
for
repetition
sweetwater
listened
with
snapping
eyes
to
all
that
was
said
and
when
he
had
been
given
the
various
clews
indicating
the
presence
of
a
third
and
as
yet
unknown
party
on
the
scene
of
crime
he
rose
excitedly
to
his
feet
and
declaring
that
it
was
a
most
promising
case
begged
permission
to
make
his
own
investigations
at
the
whispering
pines
after
which
he
would
be
quite
ready
to
begin
his
search
for
the
man
in
the
derby
hat
and
high
whose
love
for
wine
was
so
great
that
he
chose
and
carried
off
the
two
choicest
bottles
that
the
contained
a
hardy
act
for
any
man
gentleman
or
otherwise
who
had
just
strangled
the
life
out
of
a
fine
woman
like
that
if
he
exists
and
the
whole
story
is
not
a
pure
fabrication
of
the
entrapped
ranelagh
he
should
be
hard
to
find
what
do
you
say
gentlemen
he
should
be
hard
to
find
have
not
found
him
emphasised
the
district
attorney
with
the
shortest
possible
glance
at
the
coroner
face
then
the
field
is
all
before
me
smiled
sweetwater
wish
me
luck
gentlemen
it
a
blind
job
but
that
just
in
my
line
a
map
of
the
town
a
few
general
instructions
and
i
off
fox
turned
towards
the
coroner
and
opened
his
lips
but
closed
them
again
without
speaking
did
sweetwater
notice
this
act
of
if
he
did
he
failed
to
show
it
x
i
can
help
you
a
subtle
knave
a
finder
out
of
occasions
that
has
an
eye
can
stamp
and
counterfeit
advantages
though
true
advantage
never
presents
itself
a
devilish
knave
a
half
hour
spent
with
hexford
in
and
about
the
and
sweetwater
was
ready
for
the
road
as
he
made
his
way
through
the
northern
gate
he
cast
a
quick
look
back
at
the
long
low
building
he
had
just
left
with
its
tall
chimneys
and
rows
of
sightless
windows
half
hidden
half
revealed
by
the
encroaching
pines
the
mystery
of
the
place
fascinated
him
to
his
awakened
imagination
there
was
a
breathless
suggestion
in
it
a
suggestion
which
it
was
his
foremost
wish
just
now
to
understand
and
those
pines
gaunt
restless
communicative
ready
with
their
secret
if
one
could
only
interpret
their
language
how
their
heads
came
together
as
their
garrulous
tongues
repeated
the
tale
which
would
never
grow
old
to
them
until
age
nipped
their
hoary
heads
and
laid
them
low
in
the
dust
with
their
horror
half
expressed
their
gruesome
tale
unfinished
witnesses
of
it
all
commented
the
young
detective
as
he
watched
the
swaying
boughs
rising
and
dipping
before
a
certain
window
they
were
peering
into
that
room
long
before
clarke
stole
the
glimpse
which
has
undone
the
unfortunate
ranelagh
if
i
had
their
knowledge
i
do
something
more
than
whisper
thus
musing
thus
muttering
he
plodded
up
the
road
his
insignificant
figure
an
unpromising
break
in
the
monotonous
white
of
the
wintry
landscape
but
could
the
prisoner
who
had
indirectly
speeded
this
young
detective
on
his
present
course
have
read
his
thoughts
and
rightly
estimated
the
force
of
his
purpose
would
he
have
viewed
with
so
much
confidence
the
entrance
of
this
unprepossessing
stranger
upon
the
into
which
his
own
carefully
studied
admissions
had
blindly
sent
him
as
has
been
said
before
this
road
was
an
outlying
one
and
but
little
travelled
save
in
the
height
of
summer
under
ordinary
circumstances
sweetwater
would
have
met
not
more
than
a
carts
or
sledges
between
the
gates
and
the
city
streets
but
the
road
was
full
of
teams
carrying
all
sorts
of
incongruous
people
eager
for
a
sight
of
the
spot
made
forever
notorious
by
a
mysterious
crime
he
noted
them
all
the
faces
of
the
men
the
gestures
of
the
women
but
he
did
not
show
any
special
interest
till
he
came
to
that
portion
of
the
road
where
the
long
line
of
fences
began
to
give
way
to
a
few
scattered
houses
then
his
spirit
woke
and
be
became
quick
alert
and
persuasive
he
entered
houses
he
talked
with
the
people
though
evidently
not
a
dissipated
man
he
stopped
at
several
saloons
taking
his
time
with
his
glass
and
encouraging
the
chatter
of
all
who
chose
to
meet
his
advances
he
was
a
natural
talker
and
welcomed
every
topic
but
his
eye
only
sparkled
at
one
this
he
never
introduced
himself
he
did
not
need
to
some
one
was
always
ready
with
the
great
theme
and
once
it
was
started
he
did
not
let
the
conversation
languish
till
every
one
present
had
given
his
or
her
quota
of
hearsay
or
opinion
to
the
general
fund
it
seemed
a
great
waste
of
time
for
nobody
had
anything
to
say
worth
the
breath
expended
on
it
but
sweetwater
showed
no
impatience
and
proceeded
to
engage
the
attention
of
the
next
man
woman
or
child
he
encountered
with
undiminished
zest
and
hopefulness
he
had
left
the
country
road
behind
and
had
entered
upon
the
jumble
of
sheds
shops
and
streets
which
marked
the
beginnings
of
the
town
in
this
direction
when
his
quick
and
experienced
eye
fell
on
a
woman
standing
with
uncovered
head
in
an
open
doorway
peering
up
the
street
in
anxious
expectation
of
some
one
not
yet
in
sight
he
liked
the
air
and
appearance
of
the
woman
he
appreciated
the
neatness
of
the
house
at
her
back
and
gauged
at
its
proper
value
the
interest
she
displayed
in
the
expected
arrival
of
one
whom
he
hoped
would
delay
that
arrival
long
enough
for
him
to
get
in
the
word
which
by
this
time
dropped
almost
unconsciously
from
his
lips
but
a
second
survey
of
the
woman
face
convinced
him
that
his
ordinary
loquaciousness
would
not
serve
him
here
there
was
a
refinement
in
her
aspect
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
locality
in
which
she
lived
and
he
was
hesitating
how
to
proceed
when
fortune
favoured
him
by
driving
against
his
knees
a
small
lad
on
an
sled
bringing
him
almost
to
the
ground
and
upsetting
the
child
who
began
to
scream
vociferously
it
was
the
woman
child
for
she
made
instantly
for
the
gate
which
for
some
reason
she
found
difficulty
in
opening
sweetwater
seeing
this
blessed
his
lucky
stars
he
was
at
his
best
with
children
and
catching
the
little
fellow
up
he
soothed
and
fondled
him
and
finally
brought
him
with
such
a
merry
air
of
triumph
straight
to
his
arms
that
confidence
between
them
was
immediately
established
and
conversation
started
he
had
in
his
pocket
an
ingenious
little
invention
which
he
had
exhibited
all
along
the
road
as
an
indispensable
article
in
every
house
he
wanted
to
show
it
to
her
but
it
was
too
cold
a
day
for
her
to
stop
outside
would
she
allow
him
to
step
in
and
explain
how
her
work
could
be
materially
lessened
and
her
labour
turned
to
play
by
a
contrivance
so
simple
that
a
child
could
run
it
it
was
all
so
ridiculous
in
face
of
this
woman
quiet
intelligence
that
he
laughed
at
his
own
words
and
this
laughter
echoed
by
the
child
and
in
another
instant
by
the
mother
made
everything
so
pleasant
for
the
moment
that
she
insensibly
drew
back
while
he
pulled
open
the
gate
only
remarking
as
she
led
the
way
in
i
was
looking
for
my
husband
he
may
come
any
minute
and
i
afraid
he
wo
care
much
about
contrivances
to
save
me
work
that
is
if
they
cost
very
much
sweetwater
whose
hand
was
in
his
pocket
drew
it
hastily
out
you
were
watching
for
your
husband
do
you
often
stand
in
the
open
doorway
looking
for
him
her
surprised
eyes
met
his
with
a
stare
that
would
have
embarrassed
the
most
venturesome
book
agent
but
this
man
was
of
another
ilk
if
you
do
he
went
on
imperturbably
but
with
a
smile
which
deepened
her
favourable
impression
of
him
how
much
i
would
give
if
you
had
been
standing
there
last
tuesday
night
when
a
certain
cutter
and
horse
went
by
on
its
way
up
the
hill
she
was
a
woman
this
wife
of
a
master
mechanic
in
one
of
the
great
shops
hard
by
but
her
jaw
fell
at
this
and
she
forgot
to
chide
or
resist
her
child
when
he
began
to
pull
her
towards
the
open
kitchen
door
sweetwater
sensitive
to
the
least
change
in
the
human
face
prayed
that
the
husband
might
be
detained
if
only
for
five
minutes
longer
while
he
sweetwater
worked
this
promising
mine
you
looking
out
he
ventured
and
you
see
that
horse
and
cutter
what
luck
it
may
save
a
man
life
save
she
repeated
staggering
back
a
few
steps
and
dragging
the
child
with
her
save
a
man
life
what
do
you
mean
by
that
not
much
if
it
was
any
cutter
and
any
horse
and
at
any
hour
but
if
it
was
the
horse
and
cutter
which
left
the
whispering
pines
at
ten
or
half
past
ten
that
night
then
it
may
mean
life
and
death
to
the
man
now
in
jail
under
the
dreadful
charge
of
murder
catching
up
her
child
she
slid
into
the
kitchen
and
sat
down
with
it
in
the
first
chair
she
came
to
sweetwater
following
her
took
up
his
stand
in
the
doorway
unobtrusive
but
patiently
waiting
for
her
to
speak
the
steaming
kettles
and
the
table
set
for
dinner
gave
warning
of
the
expected
presence
for
which
she
had
been
watching
but
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
husband
forgotten
everything
but
her
own
emotions
who
are
you
she
asked
at
length
you
have
not
told
me
your
real
business
no
madam
and
i
ask
your
pardon
i
feared
that
my
real
business
if
suddenly
made
known
to
you
might
startle
perhaps
frighten
you
i
am
a
detective
on
the
for
evidence
in
the
case
i
have
just
mentioned
i
have
a
theory
that
a
most
important
witness
in
the
same
drove
by
here
at
the
hour
and
on
the
night
i
have
named
i
want
to
substantiate
that
theory
can
you
help
me
a
sensitiveness
to
and
quick
appreciation
of
the
character
of
those
he
addressed
was
one
of
sweetwater
most
valuable
attributes
no
glossing
of
the
truth
however
skillfully
applied
would
have
served
him
with
this
woman
so
well
as
this
simple
statement
followed
by
its
equally
simple
and
direct
inquiry
scrutinising
him
over
the
child
head
she
gave
but
a
casual
glance
at
the
badge
he
took
pains
to
show
her
then
in
as
quiet
and
simple
tones
as
he
had
himself
used
she
made
this
reply
i
can
help
you
some
you
make
it
my
duty
and
i
have
never
shrunk
from
duty
a
horse
and
cutter
did
go
by
here
on
its
way
uphill
last
tuesday
night
at
about
eleven
i
remember
the
hour
because
i
was
expecting
my
husband
every
minute
just
as
i
am
now
he
had
some
extra
work
on
hand
that
night
which
he
expected
to
detain
him
till
eleven
or
a
quarter
after
supper
was
to
be
ready
at
a
quarter
after
to
surprise
him
i
had
beaten
up
some
biscuits
and
i
had
just
put
them
in
the
pan
when
i
heard
the
clock
strike
the
hour
afraid
that
he
would
come
before
they
were
baked
i
thrust
the
pan
into
the
oven
and
ran
to
the
front
door
to
look
out
it
was
snowing
very
hard
and
the
road
looked
white
and
empty
but
as
i
stood
there
a
horse
and
cutter
came
in
sight
which
as
it
reached
the
gate
drew
up
in
a
great
hurry
as
if
something
was
the
matter
frightened
because
i
always
thinking
of
harm
to
my
husband
whose
work
is
very
dangerous
i
ran
out
to
the
gate
when
i
saw
why
the
man
in
the
sleigh
was
making
me
such
wild
gestures
his
hat
had
blown
off
and
was
lying
close
up
against
the
fence
in
front
of
me
anxious
always
to
oblige
i
made
haste
to
snatch
at
it
and
carry
it
out
to
its
owner
i
received
a
sort
of
thank
you
and
would
never
have
remembered
the
occurrence
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
murder
and
if
she
paused
doubtfully
ran
her
fingers
nervously
over
her
child
head
looked
again
at
sweetwater
waiting
expectantly
for
her
next
word
and
faltered
painfully
if
i
had
not
recognised
the
horse
sweetwater
drew
a
deep
breath
it
was
such
a
happy
climax
then
as
she
showed
no
signs
of
saying
more
asked
as
quietly
as
his
rapidly
beating
heart
permitted
did
you
recognise
the
man
her
answer
was
short
but
as
candid
as
her
expression
no
the
snow
was
blinding
besides
he
wore
a
high
collar
in
which
his
head
was
sunk
down
almost
out
of
sight
but
the
horse
was
one
which
is
often
driven
by
here
i
had
rather
not
tell
you
whose
it
is
i
have
not
told
any
one
not
even
my
husband
about
seeing
it
on
the
road
that
night
i
could
somehow
but
if
it
will
save
a
man
life
and
make
clear
who
killed
that
good
woman
ask
any
one
on
the
hill
in
what
stable
you
can
find
a
grey
horse
with
a
large
black
spot
on
his
left
shoulder
and
you
will
know
as
much
about
it
as
i
do
is
that
enough
sir
now
i
must
dish
up
my
dinner
yes
yes
it
almost
enough
just
one
question
madam
was
the
hat
what
folks
call
a
derby
like
this
one
madam
he
explained
drawing
his
own
from
behind
his
back
yes
i
think
so
as
well
as
i
can
remember
it
was
like
that
i
afraid
i
did
do
it
any
good
by
my
handling
i
had
to
clutch
it
quick
and
sure
i
bent
the
brim
to
say
nothing
of
smearing
it
with
how
sweetwater
had
started
for
the
door
but
stopped
all
eagerness
at
this
last
remark
i
had
been
cutting
out
biscuits
and
my
hands
were
white
with
flour
she
explained
simply
but
that
brushes
off
easily
i
do
suppose
it
mattered
no
no
he
hastily
assented
then
while
he
smiled
and
waved
his
hand
to
the
little
urchin
who
had
been
his
means
of
introduction
to
this
possibly
invaluable
witness
he
made
one
final
plea
and
that
was
for
her
name
eliza
simmons
was
the
straightforward
reply
and
this
ended
the
interview
the
husband
whose
anticipated
approach
had
occasioned
all
this
abruptness
was
coming
down
the
hill
when
sweetwater
left
the
gate
as
this
detective
of
ours
was
as
careful
in
his
finish
as
in
all
the
rest
of
his
work
he
called
out
as
he
went
by
i
just
been
trying
to
sell
a
wonderful
contrivance
of
mine
to
the
missus
but
it
was
no
go
the
man
looked
smiled
and
went
in
at
his
own
gate
with
the
air
of
one
happy
in
wife
child
and
home
sweetwater
went
on
up
the
hill
towards
the
top
he
came
upon
a
stopping
in
his
way
he
entered
into
talk
with
a
man
loitering
inside
the
great
door
before
he
left
him
he
had
asked
him
these
questions
any
grey
horse
in
town
yes
i
think
i
seen
it
has
a
patch
of
black
on
its
left
shoulder
yes
whose
is
it
i
a
mighty
curiosity
about
the
horse
looks
like
a
trick
horse
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
that
it
belongs
to
a
respectable
family
a
family
you
must
have
heard
about
if
you
ever
heard
anything
there
a
funeral
there
not
miss
cumberland
exclaimed
sweetwater
all
agog
in
a
moment
yes
miss
cumberland
i
thought
you
might
have
heard
the
name
yes
i
heard
it
the
tone
was
dry
the
words
abrupt
but
the
detective
heart
was
dancing
like
a
feather
the
next
turn
he
took
was
toward
the
handsome
residence
district
crowning
the
hill
xi
in
the
coach
house
all
things
that
we
ordained
festival
turn
from
their
office
to
black
funeral
our
instruments
to
melancholy
bells
our
wedding
cheer
to
a
sad
burial
feast
and
all
things
change
them
to
the
contrary
and
fifteen
minutes
later
he
stood
in
a
finely
wooded
street
before
an
open
gateway
guarded
by
a
policeman
showing
his
badge
he
passed
in
and
entered
a
long
and
slightly
curved
driveway
as
he
did
so
he
took
a
glance
at
the
house
it
was
not
as
pretentious
as
he
expected
but
infinitely
more
inviting
low
and
rambling
covered
with
vines
and
nestling
amid
shrubbery
which
even
in
winter
gave
it
a
habitable
air
it
looked
as
much
the
abode
of
comfort
as
of
luxury
and
gave
in
outward
appearance
at
least
no
hint
of
the
dark
shadow
which
had
so
lately
fallen
across
it
the
ceremonies
had
been
set
for
three
and
it
was
now
half
past
two
as
sweetwater
reached
the
head
of
the
driveway
he
saw
the
first
of
a
long
file
of
carriages
approaching
up
the
street
lucky
that
my
business
takes
me
to
the
stable
thought
he
what
is
the
coachman
name
i
ought
to
remember
it
ah
zadok
zadok
brown
a
combination
for
you
he
had
reached
this
point
in
his
soliloquy
a
bad
habit
of
his
for
it
sometimes
took
audible
expression
when
he
ran
against
another
policeman
set
to
guard
the
side
door
a
moment
parley
and
he
left
this
man
behind
but
not
before
he
had
noted
this
door
and
the
wide
and
hospitable
verandah
which
separated
it
from
the
driveway
i
am
willing
to
go
all
odds
that
i
shall
find
that
verandah
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
house
he
remarked
in
quiet
conviction
to
himself
as
he
noted
its
nearness
to
the
stable
and
the
ease
with
which
one
could
step
from
it
into
a
vehicle
passing
down
the
driveway
it
had
another
point
of
interest
or
rather
the
wing
had
to
which
it
was
attached
as
his
eye
travelled
back
across
this
wing
in
his
lively
walk
towards
the
stable
he
caught
a
passing
glimpse
of
a
nurse
face
and
figure
in
one
of
its
upper
windows
this
located
the
sick
chamber
and
unconsciously
he
hushed
his
step
and
moved
with
the
greatest
caution
though
he
knew
that
this
sickness
was
not
one
of
the
nerves
and
that
the
loudest
sound
would
fail
to
reach
ears
lapsed
in
a
blessed
if
alarming
unconsciousness
once
around
the
corner
he
resumed
a
more
natural
pace
and
perceiving
that
the
was
closed
but
that
a
window
well
up
the
garden
side
was
open
he
cast
a
look
towards
the
kitchen
windows
at
his
back
and
encountering
no
watchful
eye
stepped
up
to
the
former
one
and
peered
in
a
man
sat
with
his
back
to
him
polishing
a
bit
of
harness
this
was
probably
zadok
the
coachman
as
his
interest
was
less
with
him
than
with
the
stalls
beyond
he
let
his
eye
travel
on
in
their
direction
when
he
suddenly
experienced
a
momentary
confusion
by
observing
the
head
and
shoulders
of
hexford
leaning
towards
him
from
an
opposite
window
in
much
the
same
fashion
and
certainly
with
exactly
the
same
intent
as
himself
as
their
glances
crossed
both
flushed
and
drew
back
only
to
return
again
each
to
his
several
neither
meant
to
lose
the
advantage
of
the
moment
both
had
heard
of
the
grey
horse
and
wished
to
identify
it
hexford
for
his
own
satisfaction
sweetwater
as
the
first
link
of
the
chain
leading
him
into
the
mysterious
course
mapped
out
for
him
by
fate
that
each
was
more
or
less
under
the
surveillance
of
the
other
did
not
trouble
either
there
were
three
stalls
and
in
each
stall
a
horse
stamped
and
fidgeted
only
one
held
their
attention
this
was
a
mare
on
the
extreme
left
a
large
grey
animal
with
a
curious
black
patch
on
its
near
shoulder
the
faces
of
both
men
changed
as
they
recognised
this
distinguishing
mark
and
instinctively
their
eyes
met
across
the
width
of
the
open
space
separating
them
hexford
finger
rose
to
his
mouth
but
sweetwater
needed
no
such
hint
he
stood
silent
as
his
own
shadow
while
the
coachman
rubbed
away
with
less
and
less
purpose
until
his
hands
stood
quite
still
and
his
whole
figure
drooped
in
irresistible
despondency
as
he
raised
his
face
moved
perhaps
by
that
sense
of
a
watchful
presence
to
which
all
of
us
are
more
or
less
susceptible
they
were
both
surprised
to
see
tears
on
it
the
next
instant
he
had
started
to
his
feet
and
the
bit
of
harness
had
rattled
from
his
hands
to
the
floor
who
are
you
he
asked
with
a
touch
of
anger
quite
natural
under
the
circumstances
ca
you
come
in
by
the
door
and
not
creep
sneaking
up
to
take
a
man
at
disadvantage
as
he
spoke
he
dashed
away
the
tears
with
which
his
cheeks
were
still
wet
i
thought
a
heap
of
my
young
mistress
he
added
in
evident
apology
for
this
display
of
what
such
men
call
weakness
i
did
know
that
it
was
in
me
to
cry
for
anything
but
i
find
that
i
can
cry
for
her
hexford
left
his
window
and
sweetwater
slid
from
his
next
minute
they
met
at
the
stable
door
had
luck
whispered
the
local
officer
enough
to
bring
me
here
acknowledged
the
other
do
you
mean
to
this
house
or
to
this
stable
to
this
stable
have
you
heard
that
the
horse
was
out
that
night
yes
she
was
out
who
driving
ah
that
the
question
this
man
ca
tell
you
a
jerk
of
hexford
thumb
in
zadok
direction
emphasised
this
statement
but
i
going
to
talk
to
him
for
all
that
he
was
here
that
night
he
was
at
a
dance
he
only
knows
that
the
mare
was
out
but
i
going
to
talk
to
him
may
i
come
in
too
i
not
interrupt
i
just
fifteen
minutes
to
spare
you
can
do
as
you
please
i
nothing
to
hide
from
you
at
any
rate
which
was
quite
true
but
sweetwater
was
a
stickler
for
truth
except
in
the
statements
he
gave
his
superiors
hexford
threw
open
the
and
they
both
walked
in
the
coachman
was
not
visible
but
they
could
hear
him
moving
about
above
grumbling
to
himself
in
none
too
encouraging
a
way
evidently
he
was
in
no
mood
for
visitors
i
be
down
in
a
minute
he
called
out
as
their
steps
sounded
on
the
hardwood
floor
hexford
sauntered
over
to
the
stalls
sweetwater
stopped
near
the
doorway
and
glanced
very
carefully
about
him
nothing
seemed
to
escape
his
eye
he
even
took
the
trouble
to
peer
into
a
and
was
just
on
the
point
of
lifting
down
a
bit
of
broken
bottle
from
an
open
cupboard
when
brown
appeared
on
the
staircase
dressed
in
his
sunday
coat
and
carrying
a
bunch
of
fresh
roses
he
stopped
midway
as
sweetwater
turned
towards
him
from
the
cupboard
but
immediately
resumed
his
descent
and
was
ready
with
his
reply
when
hexford
accosted
him
from
the
other
end
of
the
stable
an
odd
beast
this
they
do
drive
her
for
her
beauty
evident
she
fast
and
she
knowing
grumbled
the
coachman
reason
enough
for
overlooking
her
spots
who
that
man
he
grunted
with
a
drop
of
his
lantern
jaws
and
a
slight
gesture
towards
the
unknown
interloper
another
of
us
replied
hexford
with
a
shrug
we
both
rather
interested
in
this
horse
would
another
time
do
pleaded
the
coachman
looking
gravely
down
at
the
flowers
he
held
it
most
time
for
the
funeral
and
i
do
feel
like
talking
indeed
i
do
gentlemen
we
wo
keep
you
it
was
sweetwater
who
spoke
the
company
enough
for
us
she
knows
a
lot
this
mare
i
can
see
it
in
her
eye
i
understand
horses
we
have
a
little
chat
she
and
i
when
you
are
gone
brown
cast
an
uneasy
glance
at
hexford
he
better
not
touch
her
he
cautioned
he
do
know
the
beast
well
enough
for
that
he
wo
touch
her
hexford
assured
him
she
does
look
knowing
she
would
like
to
tell
us
something
perhaps
was
out
night
heard
you
say
curious
how
did
you
know
it
i
said
and
said
till
i
tired
brown
answered
with
sudden
heat
this
is
pestering
a
man
at
a
very
unfortunate
time
look
the
people
are
coming
i
must
go
my
poor
mistress
and
poor
miss
carmel
i
liked
do
ye
understand
liked
and
i
do
feel
the
trouble
at
the
house
i
do
his
distress
was
so
genuine
that
hexford
was
inclined
to
let
him
go
but
sweetwater
with
a
cock
of
his
keen
eye
put
in
his
word
and
held
the
coachman
where
he
was
the
old
gal
is
telling
me
all
about
it
muttered
this
sly
adaptable
fellow
he
had
sidled
up
to
the
mare
and
their
heads
were
certainly
very
close
together
not
touch
her
see
here
sweetwater
had
his
arm
round
the
filly
neck
and
was
looking
straight
into
her
fiery
and
intelligent
eye
shall
i
pass
her
story
on
he
asked
with
a
magnetic
smile
at
the
astonished
coachman
which
not
only
softened
him
but
seemed
to
give
the
watchful
hexford
quite
a
new
idea
of
this
gawky
interloper
you
oblige
if
you
can
put
her
knowledge
into
words
the
man
zadok
declared
with
one
fascinated
eye
on
the
horse
and
the
other
on
the
house
where
he
evidently
felt
that
his
presence
was
wanted
she
was
out
that
night
and
i
know
it
as
any
coachman
would
know
who
does
come
home
stone
drunk
but
where
she
was
and
who
took
her
get
her
to
tell
if
you
can
for
i
do
know
no
more
the
dead
the
dead
flashed
out
sweetwater
wheeling
suddenly
about
and
pointing
straight
through
the
open
towards
the
house
where
the
young
mistress
the
old
servant
mourned
lay
in
her
funeral
casket
do
you
mean
her
the
lady
who
is
about
to
be
buried
could
tell
if
her
lips
were
not
sealed
by
a
murderer
hand
she
the
word
came
low
and
awesomely
rude
and
uncultured
as
the
man
was
he
seemed
to
be
strangely
affected
by
this
unexpected
suggestion
i
have
the
wit
to
answer
that
said
he
how
can
we
tell
what
she
knew
the
man
who
killed
her
is
in
jail
might
talk
to
some
purpose
why
do
you
question
him
for
a
very
good
reason
replied
sweetwater
with
an
easy
that
was
very
reassuring
he
was
arrested
on
the
spot
so
that
it
he
who
drove
this
mare
home
unharnessed
her
put
her
back
in
her
stall
locked
the
and
hung
up
the
key
in
its
place
in
the
kitchen
somebody
else
did
that
true
enough
and
what
does
it
show
that
the
mare
was
out
on
some
other
errand
than
the
one
which
ended
in
blood
and
murder
was
the
coachman
unexpected
retort
is
that
so
whispered
sweetwater
into
the
mare
cocked
ear
she
not
quite
ready
to
commit
herself
he
drawled
with
another
enigmatical
smile
at
the
lingering
zadok
she
keeping
something
back
are
you
he
pointedly
inquired
leaving
the
stalls
and
walking
briskly
up
to
zadok
the
coachman
frowned
and
hastily
retreated
a
step
but
in
another
moment
he
leaped
in
a
rage
upon
sweetwater
when
the
sight
of
the
flowers
he
held
recalled
him
to
himself
and
he
let
his
hand
fall
again
with
the
quiet
remark
you
overstepping
your
dooty
i
do
know
who
you
are
or
what
you
want
with
me
but
you
overstepping
your
dooty
he
right
muttered
hexford
better
let
the
fellow
go
see
one
of
the
maids
is
beckoning
to
him
he
shall
go
and
welcome
if
he
will
tell
me
where
he
gets
his
taste
for
this
especial
brand
of
whiskey
sweetwater
had
crossed
to
the
cupboard
and
taken
down
the
lower
half
of
the
broken
bottle
which
had
attracted
his
notice
on
his
first
entrance
and
was
now
holding
it
out
with
a
quizzical
look
at
the
departing
coachman
hexford
was
at
his
shoulder
with
a
spring
and
together
they
inspected
the
label
still
sticking
to
it
which
was
that
of
the
very
rare
and
expensive
spirit
found
missing
from
the
vault
this
is
a
find
muttered
hexford
into
his
fellow
detective
ear
then
with
a
quick
move
towards
zadok
he
shouted
out
you
better
answer
that
question
where
did
this
bit
of
broken
bottle
come
from
they
do
give
you
whiskey
like
this
to
drink
that
they
do
muttered
the
coachman
not
so
much
abashed
as
they
had
expected
and
i
would
care
for
it
if
they
did
i
found
that
bit
of
bottle
in
the
outside
and
fished
it
out
to
put
varnish
in
i
liked
the
shape
broken
this
way
yes
it
just
as
good
is
it
well
never
mind
run
along
we
close
the
for
you
i
rather
do
it
myself
and
carry
in
the
key
here
then
we
going
to
the
funeral
too
you
like
to
this
latter
in
a
whisper
to
sweetwater
the
answer
was
a
fervent
one
nothing
in
all
the
world
would
please
this
man
quite
so
well
xii
lila
lila
o
treble
woe
fall
ten
times
treble
on
that
cursed
head
whose
wicked
deed
thy
most
ingenious
sense
depriv
thee
of
hold
off
the
earth
awhile
till
i
have
caught
her
once
more
in
my
arms
let
us
enter
by
the
side
door
suggested
sweetwater
as
the
two
moved
towards
the
house
and
be
sure
you
place
me
where
i
can
see
without
being
seen
i
have
no
wish
to
attract
attention
to
myself
or
to
be
identified
with
the
police
until
the
necessity
is
forced
upon
me
then
we
wo
go
in
together
decided
hexford
find
your
own
place
you
wo
have
any
difficulty
a
crowd
is
expected
miss
condition
forbids
it
sweetwater
nodded
and
slid
in
at
the
side
door
he
found
himself
at
once
in
a
narrow
hall
from
the
end
of
which
opened
a
large
room
a
few
people
were
to
be
seen
in
this
latter
place
and
his
first
instinct
was
to
join
them
but
finding
that
a
few
minutes
yet
remained
before
the
hour
set
for
the
services
he
decided
to
improve
them
by
a
rapid
glance
about
this
hall
which
for
certain
reasons
hardly
as
yet
formulated
in
his
own
mind
had
a
peculiar
interest
for
him
the
most
important
object
within
view
according
to
his
present
judgment
was
the
staircase
which
connected
it
with
the
floor
above
but
if
you
had
asked
his
reason
for
this
conclusion
he
would
not
have
told
you
as
ranelagh
might
have
done
that
it
was
because
it
was
the
most
direct
and
convenient
approach
to
carmel
cumberland
room
his
thoughts
were
far
from
this
young
girl
intimately
connected
as
she
was
with
this
crime
which
shows
through
what
a
blind
maze
he
was
insensibly
working
with
his
finger
on
the
thread
which
had
been
put
in
his
hand
he
was
feeling
his
way
along
inch
by
inch
it
had
brought
him
to
this
staircase
and
it
led
him
next
to
a
rack
upon
which
hung
several
coats
and
a
gentleman
hat
he
inspected
the
former
and
noted
that
one
was
finished
with
a
high
collar
but
he
passed
the
latter
by
it
was
not
a
derby
the
table
stood
next
the
rack
and
on
its
top
lay
nothing
more
interesting
than
a
and
one
or
two
other
insignificant
objects
but
with
his
memory
for
details
he
had
recalled
the
keys
which
one
of
the
maids
had
picked
up
somewhere
about
this
house
and
laid
on
a
hall
table
if
this
were
the
hall
and
this
the
table
then
was
every
inch
of
the
simple
top
of
the
greatest
importance
in
his
eyes
he
had
no
further
time
for
even
these
cursory
investigations
step
could
be
heard
on
the
verandah
and
sweetwater
was
anxious
to
locate
himself
before
the
officer
came
in
entering
the
room
before
him
he
crossed
to
the
small
group
clustered
in
its
further
doorway
there
were
several
empty
chairs
in
sight
but
he
passed
around
them
all
to
a
dark
and
inconspicuous
corner
from
which
without
effort
he
could
take
in
every
room
on
that
floor
from
the
large
parlour
in
which
the
casket
stood
to
the
remotest
region
of
the
servants
hall
the
clergyman
had
not
yet
descended
and
sweetwater
had
time
to
observe
the
row
of
little
girls
sitting
in
front
of
the
bearers
each
with
a
small
cluster
of
white
flowers
in
her
hand
miss
class
he
conjectured
and
conjectured
rightly
he
also
perceived
that
some
of
these
children
loved
her
near
them
sat
a
few
relatives
and
friends
among
these
was
a
very
very
old
man
whom
he
afterwards
heard
was
a
and
a
centenarian
between
him
and
one
of
the
little
girls
there
apparently
existed
a
strong
sympathy
for
his
hand
reached
out
and
drew
her
to
him
when
the
tears
began
to
steal
down
her
cheeks
and
the
looks
which
passed
between
the
two
had
all
the
appeal
and
all
the
protection
of
a
great
love
sweetwater
who
had
many
a
soft
spot
in
his
breast
felt
his
heart
warm
at
this
one
innocent
display
of
natural
feeling
in
an
assemblage
otherwise
frozen
by
the
horror
of
the
occasion
his
eyes
dwelt
lingeringly
on
the
child
and
still
more
lingeringly
on
the
old
old
man
before
passing
to
that
mound
of
flowers
under
which
lay
a
murdered
body
and
a
bruised
heart
he
could
not
see
the
face
but
the
spectacle
was
sufficiently
without
that
would
it
have
seemed
yet
more
so
had
he
known
at
whose
request
the
huge
bunch
of
lilies
had
been
placed
over
that
silent
heart
the
sister
sick
the
brother
invisible
there
was
little
more
to
hold
his
attention
in
this
quarter
so
he
let
it
roam
across
the
heads
of
the
people
about
him
to
the
distant
hall
communicating
with
the
kitchen
several
persons
were
approaching
from
this
direction
among
them
zadok
the
servants
of
the
house
no
doubt
for
they
came
in
all
together
and
sat
down
side
by
side
in
the
chairs
sweetwater
had
so
carefully
passed
by
there
were
five
persons
in
all
two
men
and
three
women
only
two
interested
him
zadok
with
whom
he
had
already
made
a
superficial
acquaintance
and
had
had
one
bout
and
a
smart
girl
with
a
resolute
mouth
softened
by
an
insistent
dimple
who
struck
him
as
possessing
excellent
sense
and
some
natural
cleverness
a
girl
to
know
and
a
girl
to
talk
to
was
his
instantaneous
judgment
then
he
forgot
everything
but
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
for
the
clergyman
had
entered
and
taken
his
place
and
a
great
hush
had
fallen
upon
the
rooms
and
upon
every
heart
there
present
am
the
resurrection
and
the
never
had
these
consoling
words
sounded
more
solemn
than
when
they
rang
above
the
remains
of
adelaide
cumberland
in
this
home
where
she
had
reigned
as
mistress
ever
since
her
seventeenth
year
the
nature
of
the
tragedy
which
had
robbed
the
town
of
one
of
its
most
useful
young
women
the
awful
fate
impending
over
its
supposed
author
a
man
who
had
come
and
gone
in
these
rooms
with
a
spell
of
fascination
to
which
many
of
those
present
had
themselves
succumbed
the
brooding
sense
of
illness
if
not
of
impending
death
in
the
room
above
gave
to
these
services
a
peculiar
poignancy
which
in
some
breasts
of
greater
susceptibility
than
the
rest
took
the
form
of
a
vague
expectancy
bordering
on
terror
sweetwater
felt
the
poignancy
but
did
not
suffer
from
the
terror
his
attention
had
been
attracted
in
a
new
direction
and
he
found
himself
watching
with
anxious
curiosity
the
attitude
and
absorbed
expression
of
a
young
man
whom
he
was
far
from
suspecting
to
be
the
secret
representative
of
the
present
suspect
whom
nobody
could
forget
yet
whom
nobody
wished
to
remember
at
this
hallowed
hour
had
this
attitude
and
this
absorption
been
directed
towards
the
casket
over
which
the
clergyman
words
rose
and
fell
with
ever
increasing
impressiveness
he
might
have
noted
the
man
but
would
scarcely
have
been
held
by
him
but
this
interest
sincere
and
strong
as
it
undoubtedly
was
centred
not
so
much
in
the
services
careful
as
he
was
to
maintain
a
decorous
attitude
towards
the
same
but
in
the
faint
murmurs
which
now
and
then
came
down
from
above
where
unconsciousness
reigned
and
the
stricken
brother
watched
over
the
delirious
sister
with
a
concentration
and
abandonment
to
fear
which
made
him
oblivious
of
all
other
duties
and
almost
as
unconscious
of
the
rites
then
being
held
below
over
one
who
had
been
as
a
mother
to
him
as
the
sick
girl
herself
with
her
ceaseless
and
importunate
lila
lila
the
detective
watching
this
preoccupied
stranger
shared
in
some
measure
his
secret
emotions
and
thus
was
prepared
for
the
unexpected
occurrence
of
a
few
minutes
later
no
one
else
had
the
least
forewarning
of
any
break
in
the
services
there
had
been
nothing
in
the
subdued
but
impressive
rendering
of
the
prayers
to
foreshadow
a
dramatic
episode
yet
it
came
and
in
this
manner
the
final
words
had
been
said
and
the
friends
present
invited
to
look
their
last
on
the
calm
face
which
to
many
there
had
never
worn
so
sweet
a
smile
in
life
some
had
hesitated
but
most
had
obeyed
the
summons
among
them
sweetwater
but
he
had
not
much
time
in
which
to
fix
those
features
in
his
mind
for
the
little
girls
who
had
been
waiting
patiently
for
this
moment
now
came
forward
and
he
stepped
aside
to
watch
them
as
they
filed
by
dropping
as
they
did
so
a
tribute
of
fragrant
flowers
upon
the
quiet
breast
they
were
followed
by
the
servants
among
whom
zadok
had
divided
his
roses
as
the
last
cluster
fell
from
the
coachman
trembling
hand
the
undertaker
advanced
with
the
lid
and
pausing
a
moment
to
be
sure
that
all
were
satisfied
began
to
screw
it
on
suddenly
there
was
a
cry
and
the
crowd
about
the
door
leading
into
the
main
hall
started
back
as
wild
steps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
and
a
young
man
rushed
into
the
room
where
the
casket
stood
and
advanced
upon
the
officiating
clergyman
and
the
astonished
undertaker
with
a
fierceness
which
was
not
without
its
suggestion
of
authority
take
it
off
he
cried
pointing
at
the
lid
which
had
just
been
fastened
down
i
have
not
seen
her
i
must
see
her
take
it
off
it
was
the
brother
awake
at
last
to
the
significance
of
the
hour
the
clergyman
aghast
at
the
sacrilegious
look
and
tone
of
the
intruder
stepped
back
raising
one
arm
in
remonstrance
and
instinctively
shielding
the
casket
with
the
other
but
the
undertaker
saw
in
the
frenzied
eye
fixed
upon
his
own
that
which
warned
him
to
comply
with
the
request
thus
harshly
and
peremptorily
uttered
unscrewing
the
lid
he
made
way
for
the
intruder
who
drawing
near
pushed
aside
the
roses
which
had
fallen
on
the
upturned
face
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
brow
muttered
a
few
low
words
to
himself
then
he
withdrew
his
hand
and
without
glancing
to
right
or
left
staggered
back
to
the
door
amid
a
hush
as
unbroken
as
that
which
reigned
behind
him
in
that
open
casket
another
moment
and
his
white
haggard
face
and
disordered
figure
would
be
blotted
from
sight
by
the
the
minister
recovered
his
poise
and
the
bearers
their
breath
the
men
stirred
in
their
seats
and
the
women
began
to
cast
frightened
looks
at
each
other
and
then
at
the
children
some
of
whom
had
begun
to
whimper
when
in
an
instant
all
were
struck
again
into
stone
the
young
man
had
turned
and
was
facing
them
all
with
his
hands
held
out
in
a
clench
which
in
itself
was
horrible
if
they
let
the
man
go
he
called
out
in
loud
and
threatening
tones
i
will
strangle
him
with
these
two
hands
the
word
and
not
the
shriek
which
burst
irrepressibly
from
more
than
one
woman
before
him
brought
him
to
himself
with
a
ghastly
look
on
his
bloated
features
he
scanned
for
one
moment
the
row
of
deeply
shocked
faces
before
him
then
tottered
back
out
of
sight
and
fled
towards
the
staircase
all
thought
that
an
end
had
come
to
the
harrowing
scene
and
minister
and
people
faced
each
other
once
more
when
loud
and
sharp
from
above
there
rang
down
the
shrill
cry
of
delirium
this
time
in
articulate
words
which
even
the
children
could
understand
break
it
open
i
say
break
it
open
and
see
if
her
heart
is
there
it
was
too
awful
men
and
women
and
children
leaped
to
their
feet
and
dashed
away
into
the
streets
uttering
smothered
cries
and
wild
ejaculations
in
vain
the
clergyman
raised
his
voice
and
bade
them
respect
the
dead
the
rooms
were
empty
before
he
had
finished
his
appeal
only
the
very
old
uncle
and
the
least
of
the
children
remained
of
all
who
had
come
there
in
memory
of
their
departed
kinswoman
and
friend
the
little
one
had
fled
to
the
old
man
arms
before
he
could
rise
and
was
now
held
close
to
his
aged
and
shaking
knees
while
he
strove
to
comfort
her
and
explain
soon
these
too
were
gone
and
the
casket
was
refastened
and
carried
out
by
the
shrinking
bearers
leaving
in
those
darkened
rooms
a
trail
of
desolation
which
was
only
broken
from
time
to
time
by
the
now
faint
and
barely
heard
reiteration
of
the
name
of
her
who
had
just
been
borne
away
lila

xiii
what
we
want
is
here
i
tell
you
by
the
way
the
greatest
comfort
in
the
world
you
said
there
was
a
clew
to
all
remember
sweet
he
said
there
was
a
clew
i
hold
it
come
blot
in
the
sweetwater
however
affected
by
this
scene
had
not
lost
control
of
himself
or
forgotten
the
claims
of
duty
he
noted
at
a
glance
that
while
the
candid
looking
stranger
whose
lead
he
had
been
following
was
as
much
surprised
as
the
rest
at
the
nature
of
the
interruption
which
he
had
possibly
anticipated
and
for
which
he
was
in
some
measure
prepared
he
was
of
all
present
the
most
deeply
and
peculiarly
impressed
by
it
no
element
of
fear
had
entered
into
his
emotion
nor
had
it
been
heightened
by
any
superstitious
sense
something
deeper
and
more
important
by
far
had
darkened
his
thoughtful
eye
and
caused
that
ebb
and
flow
of
colour
in
a
cheek
unused
if
sweetwater
read
the
man
aright
to
such
quick
and
forcible
changes
sweetwater
took
occasion
likewise
while
the
excitement
was
at
its
height
to
mark
what
effect
had
been
made
on
the
servants
by
the
action
and
conduct
of
young
cumberland
they
know
him
better
than
we
do
was
his
inner
comment
what
do
they
think
of
his
words
and
what
do
they
think
of
him
it
was
not
so
easy
to
determine
as
the
anxious
detective
might
wish
only
one
of
them
showed
a
simple
emotion
and
that
one
was
without
any
possibility
of
doubt
the
cook
she
was
a
roman
catholic
and
was
simply
horrified
by
the
sacrilege
of
which
she
had
been
witness
there
was
no
mistaking
her
feelings
but
those
of
the
other
two
women
were
more
complex
so
were
those
of
the
men
zadok
specially
watched
each
movement
of
his
young
master
with
open
mistrust
and
very
nearly
started
upright
in
his
repugnance
and
dismay
when
that
intruding
hand
fell
on
the
peaceful
brow
of
her
over
whose
fate
to
his
own
surprise
he
had
been
able
to
shed
tears
some
personal
prejudice
lay
back
of
this
or
some
secret
knowledge
of
the
man
from
whose
touch
even
the
dead
appeared
to
shrink
and
the
women
might
not
the
same
explanation
account
for
that
curious
droop
of
the
eye
with
which
the
two
younger
clutched
at
each
hands
to
keep
from
screaming
and
interchanged
whispered
words
which
sweetwater
would
have
given
considerable
out
of
his
carefully
cherished
hoard
to
have
heard
it
was
impossible
to
tell
at
present
but
he
was
confident
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
understood
these
latter
at
least
he
had
great
confidence
in
his
success
with
women
homely
as
he
was
he
was
not
so
sure
of
himself
with
men
and
he
felt
that
some
difficulties
and
not
a
few
pitfalls
lay
between
him
and
for
instance
the
uncommunicative
zadok
but
i
the
whole
long
evening
before
me
he
added
in
quiet
consolation
to
himself
it
will
be
a
pity
if
i
ca
work
some
of
them
in
that
time
the
last
thing
he
had
remarked
before
carmel
unearthly
cry
had
sent
the
horrified
guests
in
disorder
from
the
house
was
the
presence
of
perry
in
a
small
room
which
sweetwater
had
supposed
empty
until
the
astonishing
events
i
have
endeavoured
to
describe
brought
its
occupant
to
the
door
what
the
detective
then
read
in
the
countenance
of
the
best
friend
he
kept
to
himself
but
his
own
lost
a
trace
of
its
former
anxiety
as
the
official
slipped
back
out
of
sight
and
remained
so
even
after
the
funeral
cortege
had
started
on
its
course
plans
had
been
made
for
carrying
the
servants
to
the
cemetery
and
despite
the
universal
disturbance
consequent
upon
these
events
these
plans
were
adhered
to
sweetwater
watched
them
all
ride
away
in
the
last
two
carriages
this
gave
him
the
opportunity
he
wanted
leaving
his
corner
he
looked
up
hexford
and
asked
who
was
left
in
the
house
perry
clifton
the
lawyer
cumberland
his
sick
sister
and
the
nurse
cumberland
did
he
go
to
the
grave
did
you
expect
him
to
after
sweetwater
shoulders
rose
and
his
voice
took
on
a
tone
of
indifference
there
no
telling
where
is
he
now
do
you
think
upstairs
yes
it
seems
he
spends
all
his
time
in
a
little
alcove
opposite
his
sister
door
they
wo
let
him
inside
for
fear
of
disturbing
the
patient
so
he
just
sits
where
i
told
you
doing
nothing
but
listening
to
every
sound
that
comes
through
the
door
is
he
there
now
yes
and
shaking
just
like
a
leaf
i
walked
by
him
a
moment
ago
and
noticed
particularly
where
his
room
in
sight
of
the
alcove
you
mention
no
there
a
partition
or
two
between
if
you
go
up
by
the
side
staircase
you
can
slip
into
it
without
any
one
seeing
you
coroner
perry
and
clifton
are
in
front
is
the
side
door
locked
no
lock
it
the
back
door
of
course
is
yes
the
cook
attended
to
that
i
want
a
few
minutes
all
by
myself
help
me
hexford
if
perry
has
given
you
no
orders
take
your
stand
upstairs
where
you
can
give
me
warning
if
cumberland
makes
a
move
to
leave
his
post
or
the
nurse
her
patient
i
ready
but
i
been
in
that
room
and
i
found
nothing
i
do
know
that
i
shall
you
say
that
it
is
near
the
head
of
the
stairs
running
up
from
the
side
door
just
a
few
feet
away
i
would
have
sworn
to
that
fact
even
if
you
had
told
me
muttered
sweetwater
five
minutes
later
he
had
slipped
from
sight
and
for
some
time
not
even
hexford
knew
where
he
was
perry
may
i
have
a
few
words
with
you
the
coroner
turned
quickly
sweetwater
was
before
him
but
not
the
same
sweetwater
he
had
interviewed
some
few
hours
before
in
his
office
this
was
quite
a
different
looking
personage
though
nothing
could
change
his
features
the
moment
had
come
when
their
inharmonious
lines
no
longer
obtruded
themselves
upon
the
eye
and
the
anxious
nay
deeply
troubled
official
whom
he
addressed
saw
nothing
but
the
ardour
and
quiet
they
expressed
it
not
take
long
he
added
with
a
short
significant
glance
in
the
direction
of
clifton
perry
nodded
excused
himself
to
the
lawyer
and
followed
the
detective
into
the
small
which
he
had
occupied
during
the
funeral
in
the
decision
with
which
sweetwater
closed
the
door
behind
them
there
was
something
which
caused
the
blood
to
mount
to
the
coroner
brow
you
have
made
some
discovery
said
he
a
very
important
one
was
the
quick
emphatic
reply
and
in
a
few
brief
words
the
detective
related
his
interview
with
the
master
mechanic
wife
on
the
highroad
then
with
an
eager
now
let
me
show
you
something
he
led
the
coroner
through
the
into
the
side
hall
where
he
paused
before
the
staircase
up
queried
the
coroner
with
an
obvious
shrinking
from
what
he
might
encounter
above
no
was
the
whispered
reply
what
we
want
is
and
pushing
open
a
small
door
let
into
the
under
part
of
the
stairway
if
ranelagh
in
his
prison
cell
could
have
seen
and
understood
this
movement
he
disclosed
a
closet
and
in
that
closet
a
coat
or
two
and
one
derby
hat
he
took
down
the
latter
and
holding
it
out
to
the
light
pointed
to
a
spot
on
the
under
side
of
its
brim
the
coroner
staggered
as
he
saw
it
and
glanced
helplessly
about
him
he
had
known
this
family
all
their
lives
and
the
father
had
been
his
dearest
friend
but
he
could
say
nothing
in
face
of
this
evidence
the
spot
was
a
in
which
could
almost
be
discerned
the
outline
of
a
woman
thumb
xiv
the
motionless
figure
blood
there
is
something
in
this
more
than
natural
if
philosophy
could
find
it
out
the
coat
is
here
too
whispered
sweetwater
after
a
moment
of
considerate
silence
i
had
searched
the
for
them
i
had
searched
his
closets
and
was
about
owning
myself
to
be
on
a
false
trail
when
i
spied
this
little
door
we
had
better
lock
it
now
had
we
not
till
you
make
up
your
mind
what
to
do
with
this
conclusive
bit
of
evidence
yes
lock
it
i
not
quite
myself
sweetwater
i
no
stranger
to
this
house
or
to
the
unfortunate
young
people
in
it
i
wish
i
had
not
been
last
year
i
shall
never
survive
the
strain
if
he
turned
away
sweetwater
carefully
returned
the
hat
to
its
peg
turned
the
key
in
the
door
and
softly
followed
his
superior
back
into
the
and
thence
to
their
former
retreat
i
can
see
that
it
likely
to
be
a
dreadful
business
he
ventured
to
remark
as
the
two
stood
face
to
face
again
but
we
no
choice
facts
are
facts
and
we
got
to
make
the
best
of
them
you
mean
me
to
go
on
go
on
following
up
the
clews
which
you
have
yourself
given
me
i
only
finished
with
one
there
another
the
bottles
yes
the
bottles
i
believe
that
i
shall
not
fail
there
if
you
give
me
a
little
time
i
a
stranger
in
town
you
remember
and
can
not
be
expected
to
move
as
fast
as
a
local
detective
sweetwater
you
have
but
one
duty
to
follow
both
clews
as
far
as
they
will
take
you
as
for
my
duty
that
is
equally
plain
to
uphold
you
in
all
reasonable
efforts
and
to
shrink
at
nothing
which
will
save
the
innocent
and
bring
penalty
to
the
guilty
only
be
careful
remember
the
evidence
against
ranelagh
you
will
have
to
forge
an
exceedingly
strong
chain
to
hold
your
own
against
the
facts
which
have
brought
this
recreant
lover
to
book
you
see
o
i
wish
that
poor
girl
could
get
ease
he
impetuously
cried
as
lila
lila
rang
again
through
the
house
there
can
never
be
any
ease
for
her
murmured
sweetwater
whatever
the
truth
she
bound
to
suffer
if
ever
she
awakens
to
reality
again
do
you
agree
with
the
reporters
that
she
knew
why
and
for
what
her
unhappy
sister
left
this
house
that
night
if
not
why
this
fever
that
sound
the
coroner
was
emphatic
is
the
only
one
who
is
wholly
innocent
in
this
whole
business
consider
her
at
every
point
her
life
is
invaluable
to
every
one
concerned
but
she
must
not
be
roused
to
the
fact
not
yet
nor
must
he
be
startled
either
you
know
whom
i
mean
quiet
does
it
sweetwater
quiet
and
a
seeming
deference
to
his
wishes
as
the
present
head
of
the
house
is
the
place
his
has
miss
cumberland
made
a
will
her
will
will
be
read
for
arthur
position
here
is
the
position
of
a
master
i
will
respect
it
sir
up
to
all
reasonable
bounds
i
do
think
he
meditates
giving
any
trouble
he
not
at
all
impressed
by
our
presence
all
he
seems
to
care
about
is
what
his
sister
may
be
led
to
say
in
her
delirium
that
how
you
look
at
it
the
coroner
tone
was
one
of
gloom
then
after
a
moment
of
silence
you
may
call
my
carriage
sweetwater
i
can
do
nothing
further
here
the
atmosphere
of
this
house
stifles
me
dead
flowers
dead
hopes
and
something
worse
than
death
lowering
in
the
prospect
i
remember
my
old
friend
this
was
his
desk
let
us
go
i
say
sweetwater
threw
open
the
door
but
his
wistful
look
did
not
escape
the
older
man
eye
you
not
ready
to
go
wish
to
search
the
house
perhaps
naturally
it
has
already
been
done
in
a
general
way
i
wish
to
do
it
thoroughly
the
coroner
sighed
i
should
be
wrong
to
stand
in
your
way
get
your
warrant
and
the
house
is
yours
but
remember
the
sick
girl
that
why
i
wish
to
do
the
job
my
self
you
a
good
fellow
sweetwater
then
as
he
was
passing
out
going
to
rely
on
you
to
see
this
thing
through
quietly
if
you
can
openly
and
in
the
public
eye
if
you
must
the
keys
tell
the
tale
the
keys
and
the
hat
if
the
former
had
been
left
in
the
and
the
latter
found
without
the
mark
set
on
it
by
the
mechanic
wife
ranelagh
chances
would
look
as
slim
as
they
did
immediately
after
the
event
but
with
things
as
they
are
he
may
well
rest
easily
the
clouds
are
lifting
for
him
which
shows
how
little
we
poor
mortals
realise
what
makes
for
the
peace
even
of
those
who
are
the
nearest
to
us
and
whose
lives
and
hearts
we
think
we
can
read
like
an
open
book
the
coroner
gone
sweetwater
made
his
way
to
the
room
where
he
had
last
seen
clifton
he
found
it
empty
and
was
soon
told
by
hexford
that
the
lawyer
had
left
this
was
welcome
news
to
him
he
felt
that
he
had
a
fair
field
before
him
now
and
learning
that
it
would
be
some
fifteen
minutes
yet
before
he
could
hope
to
see
the
carriages
back
he
followed
hexford
upstairs
i
wish
i
had
your
advantages
he
remarked
as
they
reached
the
upper
floor
what
would
you
do
i
wander
down
that
hall
and
take
a
long
look
at
things
you
would
i
like
to
see
the
girl
and
i
like
to
see
the
brother
when
he
thought
no
one
was
watching
him
why
see
the
girl
i
do
know
i
afraid
that
just
curiosity
i
heard
she
was
a
wonder
for
beauty
she
was
once
and
not
now
you
can
not
tell
they
have
bound
up
her
cheeks
with
cloths
she
fell
on
the
grate
and
got
burned
but
i
say
that
dreadful
if
she
was
so
beautiful
yes
it
bad
but
there
are
worse
things
than
that
i
wonder
what
she
meant
by
that
wild
cry
of
it
open
see
if
her
heart
is
there
tear
what
open
the
coffin
of
course
what
else
could
she
have
meant
well
delirium
is
a
queer
thing
makes
a
fellow
feel
creepy
all
over
i
do
reckon
on
my
nights
here
hexford
help
me
to
a
peep
i
got
a
difficult
job
before
me
and
i
need
all
the
aid
i
can
get
oh
there
no
trouble
about
that
walk
boldly
along
he
notice
wo
no
he
notices
nothing
but
what
comes
from
the
sick
room
i
see
sweetwater
jaw
had
fallen
but
it
righted
itself
at
this
last
word
listening
eh
yes
as
a
fellow
never
listened
before
expectant
like
yes
i
should
call
it
expectant
does
the
nurse
know
this
the
nurse
is
a
puzzler
how
so
half
nurse
and
half
but
go
see
for
yourself
here
a
package
to
take
in
medicine
from
the
drug
store
tell
her
there
was
no
one
else
to
bring
it
up
she
show
no
surprise
muttering
his
thanks
sweetwater
seized
the
proffered
package
and
hastened
with
it
down
the
hall
he
had
been
as
far
as
the
turn
before
but
now
he
passed
the
turn
to
find
just
as
he
expected
a
closed
door
on
the
left
and
an
open
alcove
on
the
right
the
door
led
into
miss
cumberland
room
the
alcove
circular
in
shape
and
lighted
by
several
windows
projected
from
the
rear
of
the
extension
and
had
for
its
outlook
the
stable
and
the
huge
sycamore
tree
growing
beside
it
sweetwater
fingers
passed
thoughtfully
across
his
chin
as
he
remarked
this
and
took
in
the
expressive
outline
of
its
one
occupant
he
could
not
see
his
face
that
was
turned
towards
the
table
before
which
he
sat
but
his
drooping
head
rigid
with
desperate
thinking
his
relaxed
hand
closed
around
the
neck
of
a
decanter
which
nevertheless
he
did
not
lift
made
upon
sweetwater
an
impression
which
nothing
he
saw
afterwards
ever
quite
effaced
when
i
come
back
that
whiskey
will
be
half
gone
thought
he
and
lingered
to
see
the
tumbler
filled
and
the
first
draught
taken
but
no
the
hand
slowly
unclasped
and
fell
away
from
the
decanter
his
head
sank
forward
until
his
chin
rested
on
his
breast
and
a
sigh
startling
to
sweetwater
fell
from
his
lips
hexford
was
right
only
one
thing
could
arouse
him
sweetwater
now
tried
that
thing
he
knocked
softly
on
the
door
this
reached
the
ear
oblivious
to
all
else
young
cumberland
started
to
his
feet
and
for
a
moment
sweetwater
saw
again
the
heavy
features
which
an
hour
before
had
produced
such
a
repulsive
effect
upon
him
in
the
rooms
below
then
the
nerveless
figure
sank
again
into
place
with
the
same
constraint
in
its
lines
and
the
same
dejection
sweetwater
hand
lifted
in
repetition
of
his
knock
hung
suspended
he
had
not
expected
quite
such
indifference
as
this
it
upset
his
calculations
just
a
trifle
as
his
hand
fell
he
reminded
himself
of
the
coroner
advice
to
go
easy
easy
it
is
was
his
internal
reply
walk
as
lightly
as
if
eggshells
were
under
my
feet
the
door
was
opened
to
him
this
time
as
it
swung
back
he
saw
first
a
burst
of
rosy
color
as
a
room
panelled
in
exquisite
pink
burst
upon
his
sight
then
the
great
picture
of
his
life
the
bloodless
features
of
carmel
calmed
for
the
moment
into
sleep
perfect
beauty
is
so
rare
its
effect
so
magical
not
even
the
bandage
which
swathed
one
cheek
could
hide
the
exquisite
symmetry
of
the
features
or
take
from
the
whole
face
its
sweet
and
natural
distinction
frenzy
which
had
distorted
the
muscles
and
lit
the
eyes
with
a
baleful
glare
was
lacking
at
this
moment
repose
had
quieted
the
soul
and
left
the
body
free
to
express
its
natural
harmonies
sweetwater
gazed
at
the
winsome
brown
head
over
the
nurse
shoulder
and
felt
that
for
him
a
new
and
important
factor
had
entered
into
this
case
with
his
recognition
of
this
woman
great
beauty
how
deep
a
factor
he
was
far
from
suspecting
or
he
would
not
have
met
the
eye
with
quite
so
cheery
and
a
smile
excuse
the
intrusion
he
said
we
thought
you
might
need
these
things
hexford
signed
for
them
i
obliged
to
you
are
you
one
of
them
she
sharply
asked
would
it
disturb
you
if
i
were
i
hope
not
i
no
wish
to
seem
intrusive
what
do
you
want
something
i
know
give
it
a
name
before
there
a
change
there
she
nodded
towards
the
bed
and
sweetwater
took
advantage
of
the
moment
to
scrutinise
more
closely
the
nurse
herself
she
was
a
robust
woman
producing
an
impression
of
capability
united
to
kindness
strength
of
mind
and
rigid
attendance
to
duty
dominated
the
kindness
however
if
crossed
in
what
she
considered
best
for
her
patient
possibly
for
herself
she
could
be
severe
if
not
biting
in
her
speech
and
manner
so
much
sweetwater
read
in
the
cold
clear
eye
and
firm
mouth
of
the
woman
awaiting
his
response
to
the
curt
demand
she
had
made
i
want
another
good
look
at
your
patient
and
i
want
your
confidence
since
you
and
i
may
have
to
see
much
of
each
other
before
this
matter
is
ended
you
asked
me
to
speak
plainly
and
i
have
done
so
you
are
from
headquarters
coroner
perry
sent
me
throwing
back
his
coat
he
showed
his
badge
the
coroner
has
returned
to
his
office
he
was
quite
upset
by
the
outcry
which
came
from
this
room
at
an
unhappy
moment
during
the
funeral
i
know
it
was
my
fault
i
opened
the
door
just
for
an
instant
and
in
that
instant
my
patient
broke
through
her
torpor
and
spoke
she
had
drawn
him
in
by
this
time
and
after
another
glance
at
her
patient
softly
closed
the
door
behind
him
i
have
nothing
to
report
said
she
but
the
one
sentence
everybody
heard
sweetwater
took
in
the
little
memorandum
book
and
pencil
which
hung
at
her
side
and
understood
her
position
and
extraordinary
amenability
to
his
wishes
unconsciously
a
low
exclamation
escaped
him
he
was
young
and
had
not
yet
sunk
the
man
entirely
in
the
detective
a
cruel
necessity
to
watch
so
interesting
a
patient
for
anything
but
her
own
good
he
remarked
yet
because
he
was
a
detective
as
well
as
a
man
his
eye
went
wandering
all
over
the
room
as
he
spoke
until
it
fell
upon
a
cabinet
or
closet
let
into
the
wall
directly
opposite
the
bed
what
that
he
asked
i
do
know
i
ca
make
it
out
and
i
do
like
to
ask
sweetwater
examined
it
for
a
moment
from
where
he
stood
then
crossed
over
and
scrutinised
it
more
particularly
it
was
a
unique
specimen
what
it
lacked
in
height
it
could
not
have
measured
more
than
a
foot
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
it
made
up
in
length
which
must
have
exceeded
five
feet
the
doors
of
which
it
had
two
were
both
tightly
locked
but
as
they
were
made
of
transparent
glass
the
objects
behind
them
were
quite
visible
it
was
the
nature
of
these
objects
which
made
the
mystery
the
longer
sweetwater
examined
them
the
less
he
understood
the
reason
for
their
collection
much
less
for
their
preservation
in
a
room
which
in
all
other
respects
expressed
the
quintessence
of
taste
at
one
end
he
saw
a
stuffed
canary
not
perched
on
a
twig
but
lying
prone
on
its
side
near
it
was
a
doll
with
scorched
face
and
limbs
next
this
the
broken
pieces
of
a
china
bowl
and
what
looked
like
the
torn
remnants
of
some
very
fine
lace
further
along
his
eye
lighted
on
a
young
girl
bonnet
exquisite
in
colour
and
nicety
of
material
but
crushed
out
of
all
shape
and
only
betraying
its
identity
by
its
dangling
strings
the
next
article
in
this
long
array
of
totally
unhomogeneous
objects
was
a
metronome
with
its
pendulum
wrenched
half
off
and
one
of
its
sides
lacking
he
could
not
determine
the
character
of
what
came
next
and
only
gave
a
casual
examination
to
the
rest
the
whole
affair
was
a
puzzle
to
him
and
he
had
no
time
for
puzzles
disconnected
with
the
very
serious
affair
he
was
engaged
in
investigating
some
childish
nonsense
he
remarked
and
moved
towards
the
door
the
servants
will
be
coming
back
and
i
had
rather
not
be
found
here
see
me
again
i
can
not
tell
just
when
perhaps
you
may
want
to
send
for
me
if
so
my
name
is
sweetwater
his
hand
was
on
the
knob
and
he
was
almost
out
of
the
room
when
he
started
and
looked
back
a
violent
change
in
the
patient
had
occurred
disturbed
by
his
voice
or
by
some
inner
pulsation
of
the
fever
which
devoured
her
carmel
had
risen
from
the
pillow
and
now
sat
staring
straight
before
her
with
every
feature
working
and
lips
opened
as
if
to
speak
sweetwater
held
his
breath
and
the
nurse
leaped
towards
her
and
gently
encircled
her
with
protecting
arms
lie
down
she
prayed
lie
down
everything
is
all
right
i
am
looking
after
things
lie
down
little
one
and
rest
the
young
girl
drooped
and
yielding
to
the
nurse
touch
sank
slowly
back
on
the
pillow
but
in
an
instant
she
was
up
again
and
flinging
out
her
hand
she
cried
out
loudly
just
as
she
had
cried
an
hour
before
break
it
open
break
the
glass
and
look
in
her
heart
should
be
there
her
heart
her
heart
go
or
i
can
not
quiet
her
ordered
the
nurse
and
sweetwater
turned
to
obey
but
a
new
obstacle
offered
the
brother
had
heard
this
cry
and
now
stood
in
the
doorway
who
are
you
he
impatiently
demanded
surveying
sweetwater
in
sudden
anger
i
brought
up
the
drugs
was
the
quiet
explanation
of
the
detective
i
did
mean
to
alarm
the
young
lady
and
i
do
think
i
did
it
the
fever
sir
which
makes
her
talk
so
wildly
we
want
no
strangers
here
was
young
cumberland
response
remember
nurse
no
strangers
his
tone
was
actually
peremptory
sweetwater
observed
him
in
real
astonishment
as
he
slid
by
and
made
his
quiet
escape
he
was
still
more
astonished
when
on
glancing
towards
the
alcove
he
perceived
that
contrary
to
his
own
prognostication
the
whiskey
stood
as
high
in
the
decanter
as
before
i
got
a
puzzler
this
time
was
his
comment
as
he
made
his
way
downstairs
even
gryce
would
say
that
i
wonder
how
i
come
out
uppermost
he
finished
in
secret
emphasis
to
himself
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
fail
in
the
first
big
affair
i
undertaken
on
my
own
account
xv
helen
surprises
sweetwater
lurk
lurk
the
returning
servants
drove
up
just
as
sweetwater
reached
the
lower
floor
he
was
at
the
side
door
when
they
came
in
and
a
single
glance
convinced
him
that
all
had
gone
off
decorously
at
the
grave
and
that
nothing
further
had
occurred
during
their
absence
to
disturb
them
he
followed
them
as
they
filed
away
into
the
kitchen
and
waiting
till
the
men
had
gone
about
their
work
turned
his
attention
to
the
girls
who
stood
about
very
much
as
if
they
did
not
know
just
what
to
do
with
themselves
sit
ladies
said
he
drawing
up
chairs
quite
as
if
he
were
doing
the
honours
of
the
house
then
with
a
sly
compassionate
look
into
each
face
he
artfully
remarked
you
all
upset
you
are
by
what
cumberland
said
in
such
an
unbecoming
way
at
the
funeral
like
to
strangle
ranelagh
why
could
he
wait
for
the
sheriff
it
looks
as
if
that
gentleman
would
have
the
job
all
right
oh
do
wailed
out
one
of
the
girls
the
impressionable
maggie
the
horrors
of
this
house
kill
me
i
stand
it
a
minute
longer
i
go
i
go
you
wo
you
too
to
leave
cumberland
and
his
sister
in
their
desperate
trouble
sweetwater
put
in
with
a
decision
as
suggestive
of
admiration
as
he
dared
to
assume
her
eyes
filled
and
she
said
no
more
sweetwater
shifted
his
attention
to
helen
working
around
by
her
side
he
managed
to
drop
these
words
into
her
ear
she
talks
most
but
she
does
feel
her
responsibilities
any
more
than
you
do
i
had
my
experience
with
women
and
you
of
the
sort
that
stays
she
rolled
her
eyes
towards
him
in
a
slow
surprised
way
that
would
have
abashed
most
men
i
do
know
your
name
or
your
business
here
said
she
but
i
do
know
that
you
take
a
good
deal
upon
yourself
when
you
say
what
i
shall
do
or
sha
do
i
do
even
know
myself
that
because
your
eye
is
not
so
keen
to
your
own
virtues
as
well
i
wo
say
as
mine
but
as
those
of
any
appreciative
stranger
i
help
seeing
what
you
are
you
know
she
turned
her
shoulder
but
not
before
he
caught
a
slight
disdainful
twitch
of
her
rosy
mouth
ah
ah
my
lady
not
quick
enough
thought
he
and
with
the
most
innocent
air
in
the
world
he
launched
forth
in
a
tirade
against
the
man
then
in
custody
as
though
his
guilt
were
an
accepted
fact
and
nothing
but
the
formalities
of
the
law
stood
between
him
and
his
final
doom
it
must
make
you
all
feel
queer
he
wound
up
to
think
you
have
waited
on
him
and
seen
him
tramping
about
these
rooms
for
months
just
as
if
he
had
no
wicked
feelings
in
his
heart
and
meant
to
marry
miss
cumberland
not
to
kill
her
oh
oh
maggie
sobbed
out
and
a
perfect
gentleman
he
was
too
i
ca
believe
no
bad
of
him
he
was
like
her
breath
caught
and
so
suddenly
that
sweetwater
was
always
convinced
that
the
more
cautious
helen
had
twitched
her
by
her
skirt
like
like
other
gentlemen
who
came
here
it
was
a
kind
word
he
had
or
a
smile
i
i
she
made
no
attempt
to
finish
but
bounded
to
her
feet
pulling
up
the
more
sedate
helen
with
her
let
go
she
whispered
i
afeared
of
the
man
the
other
yielded
and
began
to
cross
the
floor
behind
the
impetuous
maggie
sweetwater
summoned
up
his
courage
one
moment
he
prayed
will
you
not
tell
me
before
you
go
whether
the
candlestick
i
have
noticed
on
the
mantel
is
not
one
of
a
pair
yes
there
were
two
said
helen
resisting
maggie
effort
to
drag
her
out
through
the
open
door
smiled
sweetwater
by
which
you
mean
three
days
ago
a
lowering
of
her
head
and
a
sudden
make
for
the
door
sweetwater
changed
his
tone
to
one
of
simple
inquiry
and
was
that
where
they
always
stood
the
pair
of
them
one
on
each
end
of
the
mantel
she
nodded
involuntarily
perhaps
but
decisively
sweetwater
hid
his
disappointment
the
room
mentioned
was
a
thoroughfare
for
the
whole
family
any
member
of
it
could
have
taken
the
candlestick
i
obliged
to
you
said
he
and
might
have
ventured
further
had
she
given
him
the
opportunity
but
she
was
too
near
the
door
to
resist
the
temptation
of
flight
in
another
moment
she
was
gone
and
sweetwater
found
himself
alone
with
his
reflections
they
were
not
altogether
unpleasing
he
was
sure
that
he
read
the
evidences
of
struggle
in
her
slowly
working
lips
and
changing
impulses
so
so
thought
he
the
good
seed
has
found
its
little
corner
of
soil
i
leave
it
to
take
root
and
sprout
perhaps
the
coroner
will
profit
by
it
if
not
i
a
way
of
coaxing
tender
plants
which
should
bring
this
one
to
fruit
we
see
the
moon
shone
that
night
much
to
sweetwater
discomforture
as
he
moved
about
the
he
momentarily
expected
to
see
the
window
of
the
alcove
thrown
up
and
to
hear
cumberland
voice
raised
in
loud
command
for
him
to
quit
the
premises
but
no
such
interruption
came
the
lonely
watcher
whose
solitary
figure
he
could
just
discern
above
the
unshaded
sill
remained
immovable
with
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
but
whether
in
sleep
or
in
brooding
misery
there
was
naught
to
tell
the
rest
of
the
house
presented
an
equally
dolorous
and
forsaken
appearance
there
were
lights
in
the
kitchen
and
lights
in
the
rooms
at
the
top
of
the
house
but
no
sounds
either
of
talking
or
laughing
all
voices
had
sunk
to
a
whisper
and
if
by
chance
a
figure
passed
one
of
the
windows
it
was
in
a
hurried
frightened
way
which
sweetwater
felt
very
ready
to
appreciate
in
the
stable
it
was
no
better
zadok
had
bought
an
evening
paper
and
was
seeking
solace
from
its
columns
sweetwater
had
attempted
the
sociable
but
had
been
met
by
a
decided
rebuff
the
coachman
could
not
forget
his
attitude
before
the
funeral
and
nothing
not
even
the
pitcher
of
beer
the
detective
proposed
to
bring
in
softened
the
forbidding
air
with
which
this
old
servant
met
the
other
advances
soon
sweetwater
realised
that
his
work
was
over
for
the
night
and
planned
to
leave
but
there
was
one
point
to
be
settled
first
was
there
any
other
means
of
exit
from
these
grounds
save
that
offered
by
the
ordinary
driveway
he
had
an
impression
that
in
one
of
his
strolls
about
he
had
detected
the
outlines
of
a
door
in
what
looked
like
a
high
brick
wall
in
the
extreme
rear
if
so
it
were
well
worth
his
while
to
know
where
that
door
led
working
his
way
along
in
the
shadow
cast
by
the
house
and
afterward
by
the
stable
itself
he
came
upon
what
was
certainly
a
wall
and
a
wall
with
a
door
in
it
he
could
see
the
latter
plainly
from
where
he
halted
in
the
thick
of
the
shadows
the
moonlight
shone
broadly
on
it
and
he
could
detect
the
very
shape
and
size
of
its
lock
it
might
be
as
well
to
try
that
lock
but
he
would
have
to
cross
a
very
wide
strip
of
moonlight
in
order
to
do
so
and
he
feared
to
attract
attention
to
his
extreme
inquisitiveness
yet
who
was
there
to
notice
him
at
this
hour
cumberland
had
not
moved
the
girls
were
upstairs
zadok
was
busy
with
his
paper
and
the
footman
dozing
over
his
pipe
in
his
room
over
the
stable
sweetwater
had
just
come
from
that
room
and
he
knew
a
quiet
and
a
closed
door
only
ten
feet
away
he
glanced
again
at
the
latter
and
made
up
his
mind
advancing
in
a
quiet
sidelong
way
he
had
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
small
knob
above
the
lock
and
quickly
turned
it
the
door
was
unlocked
and
swung
under
his
gentle
push
an
opened
before
him
leading
to
what
appeared
to
be
another
residence
street
he
was
about
to
test
the
truth
of
this
surmise
when
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
and
turning
encountered
the
heavy
figure
of
the
coachman
advancing
towards
him
with
a
key
in
his
hand
zadok
was
of
an
easy
turn
but
he
had
been
sorely
tried
that
day
and
his
limit
had
been
reached
you
snooper
he
bawled
what
do
you
want
here
wo
the
run
of
the
house
content
ye
come
i
want
to
lock
that
door
it
my
last
duty
before
going
to
bed
sweetwater
assumed
the
innocent
and
i
was
just
going
this
way
it
looks
like
a
short
road
into
town
it
is
is
it
no
yes
growled
the
other
whichever
it
is
it
is
your
road
that
private
property
sir
the
alley
you
see
belongs
to
our
neighbours
no
one
passes
through
there
but
myself
and
he
caught
himself
in
time
with
a
sullen
grunt
which
may
have
been
the
result
of
fatigue
or
of
that
latent
instinct
of
loyalty
which
is
often
the
most
difficult
obstacle
a
detective
has
to
encounter
and
ranelagh
i
suppose
you
would
say
was
sweetwater
easy
finish
no
answer
the
coachman
simply
locked
the
door
and
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
sweetwater
made
no
effort
to
deter
him
more
than
that
he
desisted
from
further
questions
though
he
was
dying
to
ask
where
this
key
was
kept
at
night
and
whether
it
had
been
in
its
usual
place
on
the
evening
of
the
murder
he
had
gone
far
enough
he
thought
another
step
and
he
might
rouse
this
man
suspicion
if
not
his
enmity
but
he
did
not
leave
the
shadows
into
which
he
again
receded
until
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
the
key
went
into
the
stable
with
the
coachman
where
it
probably
remained
for
this
night
at
least
it
was
after
ten
when
sweetwater
the
house
to
say
good
night
to
hexford
he
found
him
on
watch
in
the
upper
hall
and
the
man
clarke
below
he
had
a
word
with
the
former
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
little
door
in
the
wall
back
of
the
stable
it
connects
these
grounds
with
those
of
the
fultons
the
fultons
live
on
huested
street
are
the
two
families
intimate
very
cumberland
is
sweet
on
the
young
lady
there
she
was
at
the
funeral
she
fainted
when
you
know
when
i
can
guess
god
what
complications
arise
you
do
say
that
any
woman
can
care
for
hexford
gave
a
shrug
he
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
life
he
uses
that
door
then
sweetwater
pursued
after
a
minute
probably
did
he
use
it
that
night
he
did
visit
where
did
he
go
we
ca
find
out
he
was
first
seen
on
garden
street
coming
home
after
a
night
of
debauch
he
had
drunk
hard
asked
where
he
got
the
liquor
he
maundered
out
something
about
a
saloon
but
none
of
the
places
which
he
usually
frequents
had
seen
him
that
night
i
have
tried
them
all
and
some
that
were
in
his
books
it
was
no
good
that
door
is
supposed
to
be
locked
at
night
zadok
says
that
his
duty
was
it
locked
that
night
ca
say
perhaps
the
coroner
can
you
see
the
inquiry
ran
in
such
a
different
direction
at
first
that
a
small
matter
like
that
may
have
been
overlooked
sweetwater
subdued
the
natural
retort
and
reverting
to
the
subject
of
the
saloons
got
some
specific
information
in
regard
to
them
then
he
passed
thoughtfully
only
to
come
upon
helen
who
was
just
extinguishing
the
light
good
night
he
said
in
passing
good
night
mr
sweetwater
there
was
something
in
her
tone
which
made
him
stop
and
look
back
she
had
stepped
into
the
library
and
was
blowing
out
the
lamp
there
he
paused
a
moment
and
sighed
softly
then
he
started
towards
the
door
only
to
stop
again
and
cast
another
look
back
she
was
standing
in
one
of
the
doorways
anxiously
watching
him
and
twisting
her
fingers
in
and
out
in
an
irresolute
way
truly
significant
in
one
of
her
disposition
he
felt
his
heart
leap
returning
softly
he
took
up
his
stand
before
her
looking
her
straight
in
the
eye
good
night
he
repeated
with
an
odd
emphasis
good
night
she
answered
with
equal
force
and
meaning
but
the
next
moment
she
was
speaking
rapidly
earnestly
i
ca
sleep
said
she
i
never
can
when
i
not
certain
of
my
duty
ranelagh
is
an
injured
man
ask
what
was
said
and
done
at
their
last
dinner
here
i
ca
tell
you
i
did
listen
and
i
did
see
what
happened
but
it
was
something
out
of
the
ordinary
three
broken
wineglasses
lay
on
the
tablecloth
when
i
went
in
to
clear
away
i
heard
the
clatter
when
they
fell
and
smashed
but
i
said
nothing
i
have
said
nothing
since
but
i
know
there
was
a
quarrel
and
that
ranelagh
was
not
in
it
for
his
glass
was
the
only
one
which
remained
unbroken
am
i
wrong
in
telling
you
i
would
if
if
it
were
not
for
ranelagh
he
did
do
right
by
miss
cumberland
but
he
do
deserve
to
be
in
prison
and
so
would
miss
carmel
tell
you
if
she
knew
what
was
going
on
and
could
speak
loved
him
and
i
said
enough
i
said
enough
the
agitated
girl
protested
as
he
leaned
eagerly
towards
her
i
tell
the
priest
any
more
good
night
and
she
was
gone
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
pursued
his
way
to
the
side
door
and
so
out
of
the
house
into
the
street
as
he
passed
along
the
front
of
the
now
darkened
building
he
scanned
it
with
a
new
interest
and
a
new
doubt
soon
he
returned
to
his
old
habit
of
muttering
to
himself
we
do
know
the
half
of
what
has
taken
place
within
those
walls
during
the
last
four
weeks
said
he
but
one
thing
i
will
solve
and
that
is
where
this
miserable
fellow
spent
the
hours
between
this
dinner
they
speak
of
and
the
time
of
his
return
next
day
hexford
has
failed
at
it
now
we
see
what
a
blooming
stranger
can
do
xvi
cuthbert
road
tush
i
will
stir
about
and
all
things
will
be
well
i
warrant
thee
and
he
was
walking
south
and
on
the
best
lighted
and
most
beautiful
street
in
town
but
his
eyes
were
forever
seeking
a
break
in
the
long
line
of
fence
which
marked
off
the
grounds
of
a
seemingly
interminable
stretch
of
neighbouring
mansions
and
when
a
corner
was
at
last
reached
he
dashed
around
it
and
took
a
straight
course
for
huested
street
down
which
he
passed
with
quickened
steps
and
an
air
of
growing
assurance
he
was
soon
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
where
the
street
taking
a
turn
plunged
him
at
once
into
a
thickly
populated
district
as
this
was
still
the
residence
quarter
he
passed
on
until
he
gained
the
heart
of
the
town
and
the
region
of
the
saloons
here
he
slackened
pace
and
consulted
a
memorandum
he
had
made
while
talking
to
hexford
a
big
job
was
his
comment
sorry
to
find
the
hour
quite
so
late
but
i
not
bound
to
finish
it
a
start
is
all
i
can
hope
for
so
here
goes
it
was
not
his
intention
to
revisit
the
places
so
thoroughly
overhauled
by
the
police
he
carried
another
list
that
of
certain
small
groceries
and
quiet
unobtrusive
hotels
where
a
man
could
find
a
private
room
in
which
to
drink
alone
it
being
sweetwater
conviction
that
in
such
a
place
and
in
such
a
place
only
would
be
found
the
tokens
of
those
solitary
hours
spent
by
arthur
cumberland
between
the
time
of
his
sister
murder
and
his
reappearance
the
next
day
had
they
been
spent
in
his
old
haunts
or
in
any
of
the
drinking
saloons
of
the
city
some
one
would
have
peached
on
him
before
this
he
went
on
in
silent
argument
with
himself
he
too
well
known
too
much
of
a
swell
for
all
his
lowering
aspect
and
look
to
stroll
along
unnoticed
through
any
of
the
principal
streets
so
soon
after
the
news
of
his
sister
murder
had
set
the
whole
town
agog
yet
he
was
not
seen
till
he
struck
garden
street
a
good
quarter
of
a
mile
from
his
usual
resorts
here
sweetwater
glanced
up
at
the
corner
beneath
which
he
stood
and
seeing
that
he
was
in
garden
street
tried
to
locate
himself
in
the
exact
spot
where
this
young
man
had
first
been
seen
on
the
notable
morning
in
question
then
he
looked
carefully
about
him
nothing
in
the
street
or
its
immediate
neighbourhood
suggested
the
low
and
secret
den
he
was
in
search
of
i
shall
have
to
make
use
of
the
list
he
decided
and
asked
the
first
the
way
to
hubbell
alley
it
was
a
mile
off
that
settles
it
muttered
sweetwater
besides
i
doubt
if
he
would
go
into
an
the
man
has
sunk
low
but
hardly
so
low
as
that
what
the
next
address
i
have
cuthbert
road
where
that
espying
a
policeman
eyeing
him
with
more
or
less
curiosity
from
the
other
side
of
the
street
he
crossed
over
and
requested
to
be
directed
to
cuthbert
road
cuthbert
road
that
where
the
markets
are
they
closed
at
this
time
of
night
was
the
somewhat
suspicious
reply
evidently
the
location
was
not
a
savoury
one
are
there
nothing
but
markets
there
inquired
sweetwater
innocently
it
was
his
present
desire
not
to
be
recognised
as
a
detective
even
by
the
men
on
beat
i
looking
up
a
friend
he
keeps
a
grocery
or
some
kind
of
small
hotel
i
have
his
number
but
i
do
know
how
to
get
to
cuthbert
road
then
turn
straight
about
and
go
down
the
first
street
and
reach
it
before
the
you
see
up
there
can
strike
this
corner
but
first
sew
up
your
pockets
there
a
bad
block
between
you
and
the
markets
sweetwater
slapped
his
trousers
and
laughed
i
was
born
yesterday
he
cried
and
following
the
directions
made
straight
for
the
road
worse
than
the
alley
he
muttered
but
too
near
to
be
slighted
i
wonder
if
i
should
have
borrowed
somebody
old
coat
it
had
been
wiser
certainly
in
garden
street
all
the
houses
had
been
closed
and
dark
but
here
they
were
open
and
often
brightly
lighted
and
noisy
from
cellar
to
roof
men
women
and
frequently
children
jostled
him
on
the
pavement
and
he
felt
his
pockets
touched
more
than
once
but
he
was
caleb
sweetwater
of
the
new
york
department
of
police
for
nothing
he
laughed
bantered
fought
his
way
through
and
finally
reached
the
quieter
region
and
at
this
hour
the
almost
deserted
one
of
the
markets
was
not
far
off
and
pausing
a
moment
to
consider
his
course
he
mechanically
took
in
the
surroundings
he
was
surprised
to
find
himself
almost
in
the
open
country
the
houses
extending
on
his
left
were
fronted
by
the
booths
and
stalls
of
the
market
but
beyond
these
were
the
fields
interested
in
this
discovery
and
anxious
to
locate
himself
exactly
he
took
his
stand
under
a
favouring
and
took
out
his
map
what
he
saw
sent
him
forward
in
haste
shops
had
now
taken
the
place
of
tenements
and
as
these
were
mostly
closed
there
were
very
few
persons
on
the
block
and
those
were
quiet
and
unobtrusive
he
reached
a
corner
before
coming
to
and
was
still
more
interested
to
perceive
that
the
street
which
branched
off
thus
immediately
from
the
markets
was
a
wide
and
busy
one
offering
both
a
safe
and
easy
approach
to
dealer
and
customer
i
on
the
track
he
whispered
almost
aloud
in
his
secret
will
prove
a
decent
quiet
resort
which
i
may
not
be
above
patronising
myself
but
he
hesitated
when
he
reached
it
some
houses
invite
and
some
repel
this
house
repelled
yet
there
was
nothing
shabby
or
mysterious
about
it
there
was
the
decent
entrance
lighted
but
not
too
brilliantly
a
row
of
dark
windows
over
it
and
above
it
all
a
sloping
roof
in
which
another
sparkle
of
light
drew
his
attention
to
an
upper
row
of
windows
this
time
of
the
old
dormer
shape
an
alley
ran
down
one
side
of
the
house
to
the
stables
now
locked
but
later
to
be
thrown
open
for
the
use
of
the
farmers
who
begin
to
gather
here
as
early
as
four
nothing
wrong
in
its
appearance
everything
and
yet
i
shall
find
some
strange
characters
here
was
the
sweetwater
comment
with
which
our
detective
opened
the
door
and
walked
into
the
house
it
was
an
unusual
hour
for
guests
and
the
woman
whom
he
saw
bending
over
a
sort
of
desk
in
one
corner
of
the
room
he
strode
into
looked
up
hastily
almost
suspiciously
well
and
what
is
your
business
she
asked
with
her
eye
on
his
clothes
which
while
not
fashionable
were
evidently
of
the
sort
not
often
seen
in
that
place
i
want
a
room
he
tipsily
confided
to
her
in
which
i
can
drink
and
drink
till
i
can
not
see
i
in
trouble
i
am
but
i
do
want
to
do
any
mischief
i
only
want
to
forget
i
money
and
as
he
saw
her
mouth
open
and
i
the
stuff
whiskey
just
whiskey
give
me
a
room
be
quiet
i
give
you
nothing
she
was
hot
angry
and
full
of
distrust
this
house
is
not
for
such
as
you
it
a
farmer
lodging
honest
men
stare
and
go
mad
to
see
a
feller
like
you
about
go
along
i
tell
you
or
i
call
jim
he
know
what
to
do
with
you
then
he
know
mor
i
do
myself
mumbled
the
detective
with
a
crushed
and
discouraged
air
money
and
not
a
place
to
spend
it
in
why
ca
i
go
in
there
he
peevishly
inquired
with
a
tremulous
gesture
towards
a
door
through
which
a
glimpse
could
be
got
of
a
neat
little
snuggery
nobody
see
me
give
me
a
glass
and
leave
me
till
i
rap
for
you
in
the
morning
that
worth
a
fiver
do
you
think
so
missus
and
we
begin
by
passing
over
the
fiver
no
she
was
mighty
peremptory
and
what
was
more
she
was
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
rid
of
him
this
haste
and
the
anxious
ear
she
turned
towards
the
hall
enlightened
him
as
to
the
situation
there
was
some
one
within
hearing
or
liable
to
come
within
hearing
who
possibly
was
not
so
stiff
under
temptation
could
it
be
her
husband
if
so
it
might
be
worth
his
own
while
to
await
the
good
man
coming
if
only
he
could
manage
to
hold
his
own
for
the
next
few
minutes
changing
his
tactics
he
turned
his
back
on
the
snuggery
and
surveyed
the
offended
woman
with
just
a
touch
of
maudlin
sentiment
i
say
he
cried
just
loud
enough
to
attract
the
attention
of
any
one
within
you
a
mighty
fine
woman
and
the
boss
of
this
here
establishment
that
evident
i
like
to
see
the
man
who
could
say
no
to
you
he
never
sat
in
that
cashier
seat
where
you
be
of
that
i
dead
sure
he
would
care
for
fivers
if
you
did
nor
for
tens
either
she
was
really
a
fine
woman
for
her
station
and
a
buxom
powerful
one
too
but
her
glance
wavered
under
these
words
and
she
showed
a
desire
with
difficulty
suppressed
to
use
the
strength
of
her
white
but
brawny
arms
in
shoving
him
out
of
the
house
to
aid
her
he
on
his
part
began
to
edge
towards
the
door
always
eyeing
her
and
always
speaking
loudly
in
admirably
acted
tipsy
unconsciousness
of
the
fact
i
a
man
who
likes
my
own
way
as
well
as
anybody
were
the
words
with
which
he
sought
to
save
the
situation
and
further
his
own
purposes
but
i
never
quarrel
with
a
woman
her
whims
are
sacred
to
me
i
may
not
believe
in
them
they
may
cost
me
money
and
comfort
but
i
yield
i
do
when
they
are
as
strong
in
their
wishes
as
you
be
i
going
missus
i
going
oh
the
exclamation
burst
from
him
he
could
not
help
it
the
door
behind
him
had
opened
and
a
man
stepped
in
causing
him
so
much
astonishment
that
he
forgot
himself
the
woman
was
big
bigger
than
most
women
who
rule
the
roost
and
do
the
work
in
haunts
where
work
calls
for
muscle
and
a
good
head
behind
it
she
was
also
rosy
and
of
a
make
to
draw
the
eye
if
not
the
heart
but
the
man
who
now
entered
was
small
almost
to
the
point
of
being
a
manikin
and
more
than
that
he
was
weazen
of
face
and
on
his
two
tiny
ridiculous
legs
yet
she
trembled
at
his
presence
and
turned
a
shade
paler
as
she
uttered
the
feeble
protest
jim
is
she
making
a
fool
of
herself
asked
the
little
man
in
a
voice
as
shrill
as
it
was
weak
do
your
business
with
me
women
are
no
good
and
he
stalked
into
the
room
as
only
little
men
can
sweetwater
took
out
his
ten
pointed
to
the
snuggery
and
tapped
his
whiskey
here
he
confided
bring
me
a
glass
i
mind
your
farmers
they
wo
bother
me
what
i
want
is
a
locked
door
and
a
still
mouth
in
your
head
the
last
he
whispered
in
the
husband
ear
as
the
wife
crossed
reluctantly
back
to
her
books
the
man
turned
the
bill
he
had
received
over
and
over
in
his
hand
then
scrutinised
sweetwater
with
his
first
show
of
hesitation
you
do
want
to
kill
yourself
he
asked
sweetwater
laughed
with
a
show
of
good
humour
that
appeared
to
relieve
the
woman
if
it
did
not
the
man
oh
that
it
he
cried
that
what
the
missus
was
afraid
of
was
it
well
i
vow
and
ten
thousand
dollars
to
my
credit
in
the
bank
no
i
do
want
to
kill
myself
i
just
want
to
booze
to
my
heart
content
with
nobody
by
to
count
the
glasses
you
known
such
fellers
before
and
that
cosey
little
room
over
there
has
known
them
too
just
add
me
to
the
list
it
wo
harm
you
the
man
hand
closed
on
the
bill
sweetwater
noted
the
action
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
but
his
direct
glance
was
on
the
woman
her
back
was
to
him
but
she
had
started
as
he
mentioned
the
snuggery
and
made
as
if
to
turn
but
thought
better
of
it
and
bent
lower
over
her
books
i
struck
the
spot
he
murmured
exultantly
to
himself
this
is
the
place
i
want
and
here
i
spend
the
night
but
not
to
booze
my
wits
away
oh
no
nevertheless
it
was
a
night
virtually
wasted
he
learned
nothing
more
than
what
was
revealed
by
that
one
slight
movement
on
the
part
of
the
woman
though
the
man
came
in
and
sat
with
him
for
an
hour
and
they
drank
together
out
of
the
flask
sweetwater
had
brought
with
him
he
was
as
impervious
to
all
sweetwater
wiles
and
as
blind
to
every
bait
he
threw
out
as
any
man
the
young
detective
had
ever
had
to
do
with
when
the
door
closed
on
him
and
sweetwater
was
left
to
sit
out
the
tedious
night
alone
it
was
with
small
satisfaction
to
himself
and
some
regret
for
his
sacrificed
bill
the
driving
in
of
the
farmers
and
the
awakening
of
life
in
the
market
and
all
the
stir
it
occasioned
inside
the
house
and
out
prevented
sleep
even
if
he
had
been
inclined
that
way
he
had
to
swallow
his
pill
and
he
did
it
with
the
best
grace
possible
sooner
than
was
expected
of
him
sooner
than
was
wise
perhaps
he
was
on
his
feet
and
peering
out
of
the
one
small
window
this
most
dismal
day
room
contained
he
had
not
mistaken
the
outlook
it
gave
on
to
the
alley
and
all
that
was
visible
from
behind
the
curtains
where
he
stood
was
the
high
brick
wall
of
the
neighbouring
house
this
wall
had
not
even
a
window
in
it
which
in
itself
was
a
disappointment
to
one
of
his
resources
he
turned
back
into
the
room
disgusted
then
crept
to
the
window
again
and
softly
raising
the
sash
cast
one
of
his
lightning
glances
up
and
down
the
alley
then
he
softly
let
the
sash
fall
again
and
retreated
to
the
centre
of
the
room
where
he
stood
for
a
moment
with
a
growing
smile
of
intelligence
and
hope
on
his
face
he
had
detected
close
against
the
side
of
the
wall
a
box
or
full
of
empty
bottles
it
gave
him
an
idea
with
an
impetuosity
he
would
have
criticised
in
another
man
he
flung
himself
out
of
the
room
in
which
he
had
been
for
so
many
hours
confined
and
coming
face
to
face
with
the
landlady
standing
in
unexpected
watch
before
the
door
found
it
a
strain
on
his
nerves
to
instantly
assume
the
sullen
vaguely
abused
air
with
which
he
had
decided
to
leave
the
house
nevertheless
he
made
the
attempt
and
if
he
did
not
succeed
to
his
own
satisfaction
he
evidently
did
to
hers
for
she
made
no
effort
to
stop
him
as
he
stumbled
out
and
in
her
final
look
which
he
managed
with
some
address
to
intercept
he
perceived
nothing
but
relief
what
had
been
in
her
mind
fear
for
him
or
fear
for
themselves
he
could
not
decide
until
he
had
rummaged
that
cart
of
bottles
but
how
was
he
to
do
this
without
attracting
attention
to
himself
in
a
way
he
still
felt
to
be
undesirable
in
his
indecision
he
paused
on
the
sidewalk
and
let
his
glances
wander
vaguely
over
the
busy
scene
before
him
before
be
knew
it
his
eye
had
left
the
market
and
travelled
across
the
fields
to
a
building
standing
by
itself
in
the
far
distance
its
appearance
was
not
unfamiliar
seizing
hold
of
the
first
man
who
passed
him
he
pointed
it
out
crying
what
building
is
that
that
that
the
whispering
pines
the
country
where
he
did
wait
for
the
end
of
the
sentence
but
plunged
into
the
thickest
group
of
people
he
could
find
with
a
determination
greater
than
ever
to
turn
those
bottles
over
before
he
ate
his
manner
of
going
about
this
was
characteristic
lounging
about
the
stalls
until
he
found
just
the
sort
of
old
codger
he
wanted
he
scraped
up
an
acquaintance
with
him
on
the
spot
and
succeeded
in
making
himself
so
agreeable
that
when
the
old
fellow
sauntered
back
to
the
stables
to
take
a
look
at
his
horse
sweetwater
accompanied
him
hanging
round
the
he
kept
up
his
chatter
while
sizing
up
the
bottles
heaped
in
the
cart
at
his
side
he
even
allowed
himself
to
touch
one
or
two
in
an
absent
way
and
was
meditating
an
accidental
upset
of
the
whole
collection
when
a
woman
he
had
not
seen
before
thrust
her
head
out
of
a
rear
window
shouting
sharply
leave
those
bottles
alone
they
waiting
for
the
old
clothes
man
he
pays
us
money
for
them
sweetwater
gaped
and
strolled
away
he
had
used
his
eyes
to
purpose
and
was
quite
assured
that
the
bottle
he
wanted
was
not
there
but
the
woman
words
had
given
him
his
cue
and
when
later
in
the
day
a
certain
old
jew
peddler
went
his
rounds
through
this
portion
of
the
city
a
fellow
accompanied
him
whom
even
the
sharp
landlady
in
cuthbert
road
would
have
failed
to
recognise
as
the
same
man
who
had
occupied
the
snuggery
the
night
before
he
was
many
hours
on
the
route
and
had
many
new
experiences
with
human
nature
but
he
gained
little
else
and
was
considering
with
what
words
he
should
acknowledge
his
defeat
at
police
headquarters
when
he
found
himself
again
at
the
markets
and
a
minute
later
in
the
alley
where
the
cart
stood
with
the
contents
of
which
he
had
busied
himself
earlier
in
the
day
he
had
followed
the
peddler
here
because
he
had
followed
him
to
every
other
back
door
and
alley
but
he
was
tired
and
had
small
interest
in
the
cart
which
looked
quite
undisturbed
and
in
exactly
the
same
condition
as
when
he
turned
his
back
upon
it
in
the
morning
but
when
he
drew
nearer
and
began
to
lend
a
hand
in
removing
the
bottles
to
the
waggon
he
discovered
that
a
bottle
had
been
added
to
the
pile
and
that
this
bottle
bore
the
label
which
marked
it
as
being
one
of
the
two
which
had
been
taken
from
the
on
the
night
of
the
murder
xvii
must
i
tell
these
things
had
i
but
died
an
hour
before
this
chance
i
had
liv
a
blessed
time
for
from
this
instant
there
nothing
serious
in
mortality
all
is
but
toys
renown
and
grace
is
dead
the
wine
of
life
is
drawn
and
the
lees
is
left
this
vault
to
brag
of
the
lamp
in
the
coroner
room
shone
dully
on
the
perturbed
faces
of
three
anxious
men
they
had
been
talking
earnestly
and
long
but
were
now
impatiently
awaiting
the
appearance
of
a
fourth
party
as
was
shown
by
the
glances
which
each
threw
from
time
to
time
towards
the
door
leading
into
the
main
corridor
the
district
attorney
courted
the
light
and
sat
where
he
would
be
the
first
seen
by
any
one
entering
he
had
nothing
to
hide
being
entirely
engrossed
in
his
duty
further
back
and
rather
behind
the
lamp
than
in
front
of
it
stood
or
sat
as
his
restlessness
prompted
coroner
perry
the
old
friend
of
amasa
cumberland
with
whose
son
he
had
now
to
do
behind
him
and
still
further
in
the
shadow
could
be
seen
the
quiet
figure
of
sweetwater
all
counted
the
minutes
and
all
showed
relief
the
coroner
by
a
loud
sigh
when
the
door
finally
opened
and
an
officer
appeared
followed
by
the
lounging
form
of
adelaide
brother
arthur
cumberland
had
come
unwillingly
and
his
dissatisfaction
did
not
improve
his
naturally
heavy
countenance
however
he
brightened
a
little
at
sight
of
the
two
men
sitting
at
the
table
and
advancing
broke
into
speech
before
either
of
the
two
officials
had
planned
their
questions
i
call
this
hard
he
burst
forth
my
place
is
at
home
and
at
the
bedside
of
my
suffering
sister
and
you
drag
me
down
here
at
nine
at
night
to
answer
questions
about
things
of
which
i
am
completely
ignorant
i
said
all
i
have
to
say
about
the
trouble
which
has
come
into
my
family
but
if
another
repetition
of
the
same
things
will
help
to
convict
that
scoundrel
who
has
broken
up
my
home
and
made
me
the
wretchedest
dog
alive
then
i
ready
to
talk
so
fire
ahead
perry
and
let
be
done
with
it
sit
down
replied
the
district
attorney
gravely
with
a
gesture
of
dismissal
to
the
officer
cumberland
we
have
spared
you
up
to
this
time
for
two
very
good
reasons
you
were
in
great
trouble
and
you
appeared
to
be
in
the
possession
of
no
testimony
which
would
materially
help
us
but
matters
have
changed
since
you
held
conversation
with
perry
on
the
day
following
your
sister
decease
you
have
laid
that
sister
away
the
will
which
makes
you
an
independent
man
for
life
has
been
read
in
your
hearing
you
are
in
as
much
ease
of
mind
as
you
can
be
while
your
remaining
sister
life
hangs
trembling
in
the
balance
and
more
important
still
discoveries
not
made
before
the
funeral
have
been
made
since
rendering
it
very
desirable
for
you
to
enter
into
particulars
at
this
present
moment
which
were
not
thought
necessary
then
particulars
what
particulars
do
you
know
enough
as
it
is
to
hang
the
fellow
was
he
seen
with
his
fingers
on
adelaide
throat
what
can
i
tell
you
that
is
any
more
damaging
than
that
particulars
the
word
seemed
to
irritate
him
beyond
endurance
never
had
he
looked
more
unprepossessing
or
a
less
likely
subject
for
sympathy
than
when
he
stumbled
into
the
chair
set
for
him
by
the
district
attorney
arthur
the
word
had
a
subtle
ring
the
coroner
who
uttered
it
waited
to
watch
its
effect
seemingly
it
had
none
after
the
first
sullen
glance
thrown
him
by
the
young
man
and
the
coroner
sighed
again
but
this
time
softly
and
as
a
prelude
to
the
following
speech
we
can
understand
said
he
why
you
should
feel
so
strongly
against
one
who
has
divided
the
hearts
of
your
sisters
and
played
with
one
if
not
with
both
few
men
could
feel
differently
you
have
reason
for
your
enmity
and
we
excuse
it
but
you
must
not
carry
it
to
the
point
of
open
denunciation
before
the
full
evidence
is
in
and
the
fact
of
murder
settled
beyond
all
dispute
whatever
you
may
think
whatever
we
may
think
it
has
not
been
so
settled
there
are
missing
links
still
to
be
supplied
and
this
is
why
we
have
summoned
you
here
and
ask
you
to
be
patient
and
give
the
district
attorney
a
little
clearer
account
of
what
went
on
in
your
own
house
before
you
broke
up
that
evening
and
you
went
to
your
debauch
and
your
sister
adelaide
to
her
death
at
the
whispering
pines
i
do
know
what
you
mean
he
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
table
with
each
word
nothing
went
on
that
is
something
went
on
at
it
was
not
a
usual
meal
put
in
the
district
attorney
you
and
your
sisters
stop
he
was
at
that
point
of
passion
which
dulls
the
most
to
all
sense
of
propriety
do
talk
to
me
about
that
dinner
i
want
to
forget
that
dinner
i
want
to
forget
everything
but
the
two
things
i
live
for
to
see
that
fellow
hanged
and
to
the
words
choked
him
and
he
let
his
head
fall
but
presently
threw
it
up
again
that
dastard
whom
may
god
confound
passed
a
letter
across
adelaide
into
carmel
hand
he
panted
out
i
saw
him
but
i
did
take
it
in
i
was
thinking
i
was
who
broke
the
glasses
urged
his
relentless
inquisitor
one
at
your
plate
one
at
carmel
and
one
at
the
head
of
the
board
where
sat
your
sister
adelaide
god
must
i
tell
these
things
he
had
started
to
his
feet
and
his
hand
violent
in
all
it
did
struck
his
forehead
impulsively
as
he
uttered
this
exclamation
have
it
then
heaven
knows
i
think
of
it
enough
not
to
be
afraid
to
speak
it
out
in
words
adelaide
the
name
came
with
passion
but
once
uttered
produced
its
own
calming
effect
so
that
he
went
on
with
more
restraint
adelaide
never
had
much
patience
with
me
she
was
a
girl
who
only
saw
one
way
right
the
right
was
what
she
dinned
into
my
ears
from
the
time
i
was
a
small
boy
and
did
know
but
that
all
youngsters
were
brought
up
by
sisters
i
grew
to
hate
what
she
called
right
i
wanted
pleasure
a
free
time
and
a
good
drink
whenever
the
fancy
took
me
you
know
what
i
am
perry
and
everybody
in
town
knows
but
the
impulse
which
has
always
ruled
me
was
not
a
downright
evil
one
or
if
it
was
i
called
it
natural
independence
and
let
it
go
at
that
but
adelaide
suffered
i
did
understand
it
and
i
did
care
a
fig
for
it
but
she
suffer
god
forgive
me
he
stopped
and
mopped
his
forehead
sweetwater
moved
a
trifle
on
his
seat
but
the
others
men
who
had
passed
the
meridian
of
life
who
had
known
temptations
possibly
had
succumbed
to
them
from
time
to
time
sat
like
two
statues
one
in
full
light
and
the
other
in
as
dark
a
shadow
as
he
could
find
that
afternoon
young
cumberland
presently
resumed
she
was
keyed
up
more
than
usual
she
loved
ranelagh
damn
him
and
he
had
played
or
was
playing
her
false
she
watched
him
with
eyes
that
madden
me
now
when
i
think
of
them
she
saw
him
look
at
carmel
and
she
saw
carmel
look
at
him
then
her
eyes
fell
on
me
i
was
angry
angry
at
them
all
and
i
wanted
a
drink
it
was
not
her
habit
to
have
wine
on
the
table
but
sometimes
when
ranelagh
was
there
she
did
she
was
a
slave
to
ranelagh
and
he
could
make
her
do
whatever
he
wished
just
as
he
can
make
you
and
everybody
else
here
he
shot
insolent
glances
at
his
two
interlocutors
one
of
whom
changed
colour
which
happily
he
did
not
see
the
bell
i
ordered
have
in
the
champagne
i
want
to
drink
to
your
marriage
and
the
happy
days
in
prospect
for
us
all
it
was
brutal
and
i
knew
it
but
i
was
reckless
and
wild
for
the
wine
so
i
guess
was
ranelagh
for
he
smiled
at
her
and
she
rang
for
the
champagne
when
the
glasses
had
been
set
beside
each
plate
she
turned
towards
carmel
will
all
drink
she
said
my
coming
marriage
this
made
carmel
turn
pale
for
adelaide
had
never
been
known
to
drink
a
drop
of
liquor
in
her
life
i
felt
a
little
queer
myself
and
not
one
of
us
spoke
till
the
glasses
were
filled
and
the
maid
had
left
the
and
shut
the
door
then
adelaide
rose
will
drink
standing
said
she
and
never
had
i
seen
her
look
as
she
did
then
i
thought
of
my
evil
life
when
i
should
have
been
watching
ranelagh
and
when
she
lifted
the
glass
to
her
lips
and
looked
at
me
almost
as
earnestly
as
she
did
at
ranelagh
but
it
was
a
different
kind
of
earnestness
i
felt
like
like
well
like
the
wretch
i
was
and
always
had
been
possibly
always
will
be
she
drank
we
would
call
it
drinking
for
she
just
touched
the
wine
with
her
lips
but
to
her
it
was
debauch
then
she
stood
waiting
with
the
strangest
gleam
in
her
eyes
while
ranelagh
drained
his
glass
and
i
drained
mine
ranelagh
thought
she
wanted
some
sentiment
and
started
to
say
something
appropriate
but
his
eye
fell
on
carmel
who
had
tried
to
drink
and
could
and
he
bungled
over
his
words
and
at
last
came
to
a
pause
under
the
steady
stare
of
adelaide
eyes
mind
elwood
she
said
know
what
you
would
like
to
say
but
that
not
what
i
am
thinking
of
now
i
am
thinking
of
my
brother
the
boy
who
will
soon
be
left
to
find
his
way
through
life
without
even
the
unwelcome
restraint
of
my
presence
i
want
him
to
remember
this
day
i
want
him
to
remember
me
as
i
stand
here
before
him
with
this
glass
in
my
hand
you
see
wine
in
it
arthur
but
i
see
poison
poison
nothing
else
for
one
like
you
who
can
not
refuse
a
friend
can
not
refuse
your
own
longing
never
from
this
day
on
shall
another
bottle
be
opened
under
my
roof
carmel
you
have
grieved
as
well
as
i
over
what
has
passed
for
pleasure
in
this
house
do
as
i
do
and
may
arthur
see
and
remember
her
fingers
opened
the
glass
fell
from
her
hand
and
lay
in
broken
fragments
beside
her
plate
carmel
followed
suit
and
before
i
knew
it
my
own
fingers
had
opened
and
my
own
glass
lay
in
pieces
on
the
beneath
me
only
ranelagh
hand
remained
steady
he
did
not
choose
to
please
her
or
he
was
planning
his
perfidy
and
had
not
caught
her
words
or
understood
her
action
she
held
her
breath
watching
that
hand
and
i
can
hear
the
gasp
yet
with
which
she
saw
him
set
his
glass
down
quietly
on
the
board
that
the
story
of
those
three
broken
glasses
if
she
had
not
died
that
night
i
should
be
laughing
at
them
now
but
she
did
die
and
i
do
laugh
i
curse
curse
her
recreant
lover
and
sometimes
myself
do
you
want
anything
more
of
me
i
eager
to
be
gone
if
you
do
the
district
attorney
sought
out
and
lifted
a
paper
from
the
others
lying
on
the
desk
before
him
it
was
the
first
movement
he
had
made
since
cumberland
began
his
tale
i
sorry
said
he
with
a
rapid
examination
of
the
paper
in
his
hand
but
i
shall
have
to
detain
you
a
few
minutes
longer
what
happened
after
the
dinner
where
did
you
go
from
the
table
i
went
to
my
room
to
smoke
i
was
upset
and
thirsty
as
a
fish
have
you
liquor
in
your
room
sometimes
did
you
have
any
that
night
not
a
drop
i
did
dare
i
wanted
that
champagne
bottle
but
adelaide
had
been
too
quick
for
me
it
was
thrown
out
wasted
i
do
believe
wasted
so
you
did
not
drink
you
only
smoked
in
your
room
smoked
one
cigar
that
was
all
then
i
went
down
town
his
tone
had
grown
sulky
the
emotion
which
had
buoyed
him
up
till
now
seemed
suddenly
to
have
left
him
with
it
went
the
fire
from
his
eye
the
quiver
from
his
lip
and
it
is
necessary
to
add
everything
else
calculated
to
awaken
sympathy
he
was
simply
sullen
now
may
i
ask
by
which
door
you
left
the
house
the
side
door
the
one
i
always
take
what
overcoat
did
you
wear
i
do
remember
the
first
one
i
came
to
i
suppose
but
you
can
surely
tell
what
hat
they
expected
a
violent
reply
and
they
got
it
no
i
ca
what
has
my
hat
got
to
do
with
the
guilt
of
elwood
ranelagh
nothing
we
hope
was
the
imperturbable
answer
but
we
find
it
necessary
to
establish
absolutely
just
what
overcoat
and
what
hat
you
wore
down
street
that
night
i
told
you
that
i
do
remember
the
young
man
colour
was
rising
are
not
these
the
ones
queried
the
district
attorney
making
a
sign
to
sweetwater
who
immediately
stepped
forward
with
a
shabby
old
ulster
over
his
arm
and
a
battered
derby
in
his
hand
the
young
man
started
rose
then
sat
again
shouting
out
with
angry
emphasis
yet
you
recognise
these
why
should
i
they
mine
only
i
do
wear
them
any
more
done
for
you
must
have
rooted
them
out
from
some
closet
we
did
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
what
closet
i
no
what
do
i
know
about
my
old
clothes
i
leave
that
to
the
women
the
slight
faltering
observable
in
the
latter
word
conveyed
nothing
to
these
men
cumberland
the
district
attorney
was
very
serious
this
hat
and
this
coat
old
as
they
are
were
worn
into
town
from
your
house
that
night
this
we
know
absolutely
we
can
even
trace
them
to
the
mechanically
not
spontaneously
this
time
the
young
man
rose
to
his
feet
staring
first
at
the
man
who
had
uttered
these
words
then
at
the
garments
which
sweetwater
still
held
in
view
no
anger
now
he
was
too
deeply
shaken
for
that
too
shaken
to
answer
at
once
too
shaken
to
be
quite
the
master
of
his
own
faculties
but
he
rallied
after
an
interval
during
which
these
three
men
devoured
his
face
each
under
his
own
special
anxiety
and
read
there
possibly
what
each
least
wanted
to
see
i
do
know
anything
about
it
were
the
words
with
which
arthur
cumberland
sought
to
escape
from
the
net
which
had
been
thus
deftly
cast
about
him
i
did
wear
the
things
anybody
can
tell
you
what
clothes
i
came
home
in
ranelagh
may
have
borrowed
ranelagh
wore
his
own
coat
and
hat
we
will
let
the
subject
of
apparel
drop
and
come
to
a
topic
on
which
you
may
be
better
qualified
to
speak
cumberland
you
have
told
us
that
you
did
know
at
the
time
and
ca
remember
now
where
you
spent
that
night
and
most
of
the
next
morning
all
you
can
remember
is
that
it
was
in
some
place
where
they
let
you
drink
all
you
wished
and
leave
when
the
fancy
took
you
and
not
before
it
was
none
of
your
usual
haunts
this
seemed
strange
to
your
friends
at
the
time
but
it
is
easier
for
us
to
understand
now
that
you
have
told
us
what
had
occurred
at
your
you
dreaded
to
have
your
sister
know
how
soon
you
could
escape
the
influence
of
that
moment
you
wished
to
drink
your
fill
and
leave
your
family
none
the
wiser
am
i
not
right
yes
it
plain
enough
is
it
why
harp
on
that
string
do
you
see
that
it
maddens
me
do
you
want
to
drive
me
to
drink
again
the
coroner
interposed
he
had
been
very
willing
to
leave
the
burden
of
this
painful
inquiry
to
the
man
who
had
no
personal
feelings
to
contend
with
but
at
this
indignant
cry
he
started
forward
and
with
an
air
of
fatherly
persuasion
remarked
kindly
you
must
mind
the
official
tone
or
the
official
persistence
there
is
reason
for
all
that
fox
says
answer
him
frankly
and
this
inquiry
will
terminate
speedily
we
have
no
wish
to
harry
you
only
to
get
at
the
truth
the
truth
i
thought
you
had
that
pat
enough
the
truth
the
truth
about
what
ranelagh
or
me
i
should
think
it
was
about
me
from
the
kind
of
questions
you
ask
it
is
just
now
resumed
the
district
attorney
as
his
colleague
drew
back
out
of
sight
once
more
you
can
not
remember
the
saloon
in
which
you
drank
that
possible
enough
but
perhaps
you
can
remember
what
they
gave
you
was
it
whiskey
rum
absinthe
or
what
the
question
took
his
irritable
listener
by
surprise
arthur
gasped
and
tried
to
steal
some
comfort
from
coroner
perry
eye
but
that
old
friend
face
was
too
much
in
shadow
and
the
young
man
was
forced
to
meet
the
district
attorney
eye
instead
and
answer
the
district
attorney
question
i
drank
absinthe
he
cried
at
last
from
this
bottle
queried
the
other
motioning
again
to
sweetwater
who
now
brought
forward
the
bottle
he
had
picked
up
in
cuthbert
road
arthur
cumberland
glanced
at
the
bottle
the
detective
held
up
saw
the
label
saw
the
shape
and
sank
limply
in
his
chair
his
eyes
starting
his
jaw
falling
where
did
you
get
that
he
asked
pulling
himself
together
with
a
sudden
desperate
that
caused
sweetwater
to
cast
a
quick
significant
glance
at
the
coroner
as
he
withdrew
to
his
corner
leaving
the
bottle
on
the
table
that
answered
the
district
attorney
was
picked
up
at
a
small
hotel
on
cuthbert
road
just
back
of
the
markets
i
do
know
the
place
it
not
far
from
the
whispering
pines
in
fact
you
can
see
the
from
the
front
door
of
this
hotel
i
do
know
the
place
i
tell
you
it
not
a
resort
not
select
enough
by
a
long
shot
to
have
this
brand
of
liquor
in
its
cellar
they
tell
me
that
this
is
of
very
choice
quality
that
very
few
private
families
even
indulge
in
it
that
there
were
only
two
bottles
of
it
left
in
the
when
the
inventory
was
last
taken
that
those
two
bottles
are
now
gone
and
that
this
is
one
of
them
is
that
what
you
want
to
say
well
it
may
be
for
all
i
know
i
did
carry
it
there
i
did
have
the
drinking
of
it
we
have
seen
the
man
and
woman
who
keep
that
hotel
they
will
talk
if
they
have
to
they
will
his
dogged
rather
astonished
them
well
that
ought
to
please
you
i
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
a
change
had
taken
place
in
him
the
irritability
approaching
to
violence
which
had
attended
every
speech
and
infused
itself
into
every
movement
since
he
came
into
the
room
had
left
him
he
spoke
quietly
and
with
a
touch
of
irony
in
his
tone
he
seemed
more
the
man
but
not
a
whit
more
prepossessing
and
if
anything
less
calculated
to
inspire
confidence
the
district
attorney
showed
that
he
was
baffled
and
perry
moved
uneasily
in
his
seat
until
sweetwater
coming
forward
took
up
the
cue
and
spoke
for
the
first
time
since
young
cumberland
entered
the
room
then
i
have
no
doubt
but
you
will
do
us
this
favour
he
volunteered
in
his
pleasantest
manner
it
not
a
long
walk
from
here
will
you
go
there
in
my
company
with
your
pulled
up
and
your
hat
well
down
over
your
eyes
and
ask
for
a
seat
in
the
snuggery
and
show
them
this
bottle
they
wo
know
that
it
empty
the
man
is
sharp
and
the
woman
intelligent
they
will
see
that
you
are
a
stranger
and
admit
you
readily
they
are
only
shy
of
one
man
the
man
who
drank
there
on
the
night
of
your
sister
murder
you
a
he
began
with
a
touch
of
his
old
violence
but
realising
perhaps
that
his
fingers
were
in
a
trap
he
modified
his
manner
again
and
continued
more
quietly
this
is
an
odd
request
to
make
i
begin
to
feel
as
if
my
word
were
doubted
here
as
if
my
failings
and
reckless
confession
of
the
beastly
way
in
which
i
spent
that
night
were
making
you
feel
that
i
have
no
good
in
me
and
am
at
once
a
liar
and
a
sneak
not
i
wo
go
with
you
to
that
low
drinking
hell
unless
you
make
me
but
i
swear
do
swear
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
who
spoke
we
would
believe
you
and
it
would
be
only
adding
perjury
to
the
rest
you
would
believe
me
no
we
have
reasons
my
boy
there
were
two
bottles
well
the
other
has
been
found
nearer
your
home
that
a
trick
you
all
up
to
tricks
not
in
this
case
arthur
let
me
entreat
you
in
memory
of
your
father
to
be
candid
with
us
we
have
arrested
a
man
he
denies
his
guilt
but
can
produce
no
witnesses
in
support
of
his
assertions
yet
such
witnesses
may
exist
indeed
we
think
that
one
such
does
exist
the
man
who
took
the
bottles
from
the
did
so
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
time
when
this
crime
was
perpetrated
on
your
sister
he
should
be
able
to
give
valuable
testimony
for
or
against
elwood
ranelagh
now
you
can
see
why
we
are
in
search
of
this
witness
and
why
we
think
you
can
serve
us
in
this
secret
and
extraordinary
matter
if
you
ca
say
so
and
we
will
desist
from
all
further
questions
but
this
will
not
help
you
it
will
only
show
that
in
our
opinion
you
have
gained
the
rights
of
a
man
suspected
of
something
more
than
shirking
his
duty
as
an
unknown
and
hitherto
unsuspected
witness
this
is
awful
young
cumberland
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
swaying
to
and
fro
before
them
like
a
man
struck
between
the
eyes
by
some
maddening
blow
god
if
i
had
only
died
that
night
he
muttered
with
his
eyes
upon
the
floor
and
every
muscle
tense
with
the
shock
of
this
last
calamity
perry
he
moaned
suddenly
stretching
out
one
hand
in
entreaty
and
clutching
at
the
table
for
support
with
the
other
let
me
go
for
let
me
think
my
brain
is
all
in
a
whirl
i
try
to
answer
but
even
as
he
spoke
he
realised
the
futility
of
his
request
his
eye
had
fallen
again
on
the
bottle
and
in
its
shape
and
label
he
beheld
a
witness
bound
to
testify
against
him
if
he
kept
silent
himself
do
answer
he
went
on
holding
fast
to
the
table
but
letting
his
other
hand
fall
i
was
always
a
fool
i
nothing
but
a
fool
now
i
may
as
well
own
the
truth
and
be
done
with
it
i
was
in
the
clubhouse
i
did
rob
the
i
did
carry
off
the
bottles
to
have
a
quiet
spree
and
it
was
to
some
place
on
cuthbert
road
i
went
but
when
i
admitted
so
much
i
admitted
all
i
saw
nothing
of
my
sister
murder
saw
nothing
of
what
went
on
in
the
rooms
upstairs
i
crept
in
by
the
open
window
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
and
i
came
out
by
the
same
i
only
wanted
the
liquor
and
when
i
got
it
i
slid
out
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
made
my
way
over
the
to
the
road
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
he
stood
trembling
there
was
something
in
the
silence
surrounding
him
which
seemed
to
go
to
his
heart
for
his
free
right
hand
rose
unconsciously
to
his
breast
and
clung
there
sweetwater
began
to
wish
himself
a
million
of
miles
away
from
this
scene
this
was
not
the
enjoyable
part
of
his
work
this
was
the
part
from
which
he
always
shrunk
with
overpowering
distaste
the
district
attorney
voice
sounded
thin
almost
piercing
as
he
made
this
remark
you
entered
by
an
open
window
why
did
you
go
in
by
the
door
i
had
the
key
i
had
only
abstracted
the
one
which
opens
the
the
rest
i
left
on
the
ring
it
was
the
sight
of
this
key
lying
on
our
which
first
gave
me
the
idea
i
feel
like
a
cad
when
i
think
of
it
but
that
of
no
account
now
all
i
really
care
about
is
for
you
to
believe
what
i
tell
you
i
was
mixed
up
in
that
matter
of
my
sister
death
i
did
know
about
it
i
wish
i
had
adelaide
might
have
been
saved
we
might
all
have
been
saved
it
was
not
to
flushed
he
slowly
sank
back
into
his
seat
no
complaint
now
of
being
in
a
hurry
or
of
his
anxiety
to
regain
his
sick
sister
bedside
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
those
fears
in
the
perturbations
of
the
moment
his
mind
and
interest
were
here
everything
else
had
grown
dim
with
distance
did
you
try
the
front
door
what
was
the
use
i
knew
it
to
be
locked
what
was
the
use
of
trying
the
window
was
it
also
presumably
locked
the
red
mounted
hot
and
feverish
to
his
cheek
you
think
me
no
better
than
a
street
urchin
or
something
worse
he
exclaimed
i
knew
that
window
i
had
been
through
it
before
you
can
move
that
lock
with
your
i
had
calculated
on
entering
that
way
ranelagh
story
receives
confirmation
commented
the
district
attorney
wheeling
suddenly
towards
the
coroner
he
says
that
he
found
this
window
unlocked
when
he
approached
it
with
the
idea
of
escaping
that
way
arthur
cumberland
remained
unmoved
the
district
attorney
wheeled
back
there
were
a
number
of
bottles
taken
from
the
some
half
dozen
were
left
on
the
kitchen
table
why
did
you
trouble
yourself
to
carry
up
so
many
because
my
greed
outran
my
convenience
i
thought
i
could
lug
away
an
armful
but
there
are
limits
to
one
ability
i
realised
this
when
i
remembered
how
far
i
had
to
go
and
so
left
the
greater
part
of
them
behind
why
when
you
had
a
team
ready
to
carry
you
a
i
had
no
team
but
the
denial
cost
him
something
his
cheek
lost
its
ruddiness
and
took
on
a
sickly
white
which
did
not
leave
it
again
as
long
as
the
interview
lasted
you
had
no
team
how
then
did
you
manage
to
reach
home
in
time
to
make
your
way
back
to
cuthbert
road
by
eleven
i
did
go
home
i
went
straight
across
the
if
fresh
snow
had
fallen
you
would
have
seen
my
tracks
all
the
way
to
cuthbert
road
if
fresh
snow
had
not
fallen
we
should
have
known
the
whole
story
of
that
night
before
an
hour
had
passed
how
did
you
carry
those
bottles
in
my
overcoat
pockets
these
pockets
he
blurted
out
clapping
his
hands
on
either
side
of
him
had
it
begun
to
snow
when
you
left
the
clubhouse
no
was
it
dark
i
guess
not
the
links
were
bright
as
day
or
i
should
have
got
over
them
as
quickly
as
i
did
quickly
how
quickly
the
district
attorney
stole
a
glance
at
the
coroner
which
made
sweetwater
advance
a
step
from
his
corner
i
do
know
i
do
understand
these
questions
was
the
sullen
reply
you
walked
quickly
does
that
mean
you
did
look
back
how
look
back
your
sister
lit
a
candle
in
the
small
room
where
her
coat
was
found
this
light
should
have
been
visible
from
the
i
did
see
any
light
he
was
almost
rough
in
these
answers
he
was
showing
himself
now
at
his
very
worst
a
few
more
questions
followed
but
they
were
of
minor
import
and
aroused
less
violent
feeling
the
serious
portion
of
the
examination
if
thus
it
might
be
called
was
over
and
all
parties
showed
the
reaction
which
follows
all
unnatural
restraint
or
subdued
excitement
the
coroner
glanced
meaningly
at
the
district
attorney
who
tapping
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
he
finally
turned
again
upon
arthur
cumberland
you
wish
to
return
to
your
sister
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
i
will
trouble
you
no
more
your
sleigh
is
at
the
door
i
presume
the
young
man
nodded
then
rising
slowly
looked
first
at
the
district
attorney
then
at
the
coroner
with
a
glance
of
searching
inquiry
which
did
not
escape
the
watchful
eye
of
sweetwater
lurking
in
the
rear
there
was
no
display
of
anger
scarcely
of
impatience
in
him
now
if
he
spoke
they
did
not
hear
him
and
when
he
moved
it
was
heavily
and
with
a
drooping
head
they
watched
him
go
each
as
silent
as
he
the
coroner
tried
to
speak
but
succeeded
no
better
than
the
boy
himself
when
the
door
opened
under
his
hand
they
all
showed
relief
but
were
startled
back
into
their
former
attention
by
his
turning
suddenly
in
the
doorway
with
this
final
remark
what
did
you
say
about
a
bottle
with
a
special
label
on
it
being
found
at
our
house
it
never
was
or
if
it
was
some
fellow
has
been
playing
you
a
trick
i
carried
off
those
two
bottles
myself
one
you
see
there
the
other
is
i
ca
tell
where
but
i
did
take
it
home
that
you
can
bet
on
one
more
look
followed
by
a
heavy
frown
and
a
low
growling
sound
in
his
throat
which
may
have
been
his
way
of
saying
and
he
was
gone
sweetwater
came
forward
and
shut
the
door
then
the
three
men
drew
more
closely
together
and
the
district
attorney
remarked
he
is
better
at
the
house
i
had
the
heart
on
your
account
perry
to
hurry
matters
faster
than
necessity
compels
what
a
lout
he
is
pardon
me
but
what
a
lout
he
is
to
have
had
two
such
uncommon
and
attractive
sisters
and
such
a
father
interposed
the
coroner
just
so
and
such
a
father
sweetwater
hey
what
the
matter
you
do
look
satisfied
did
i
cover
the
ground
fully
sir
so
far
as
i
see
now
but
well
well
out
with
it
i
do
know
what
to
out
with
it
all
right
but
i
guess
i
a
fool
or
tired
or
something
can
i
do
anything
more
for
you
if
not
i
should
like
to
hunt
up
a
bunk
a
night
sleep
will
make
a
man
of
me
again
go
then
that
is
if
perry
has
no
orders
for
you
none
i
want
my
sleep
too
but
perry
had
not
the
aspect
of
one
who
expects
to
get
it
sweetwater
brightened
a
few
more
words
some
understanding
as
to
the
morrow
and
he
was
gone
the
district
attorney
and
the
coroner
still
sat
but
very
little
passed
between
them
the
clock
overhead
struck
the
hour
both
looked
up
but
neither
moved
another
fifteen
minutes
then
the
telephone
rang
the
coroner
rose
and
lifted
the
receiver
the
message
could
be
heard
by
both
gentlemen
in
the
extreme
quiet
of
this
midnight
hour
dr
perry
yes
i
listening
he
came
in
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
greatly
agitated
and
very
white
i
ran
upon
him
in
the
lower
hall
and
he
looked
angry
enough
to
knock
me
down
but
he
simply
let
out
a
curse
and
passed
straight
up
to
his
sister
room
i
waited
till
he
came
out
then
i
managed
to
get
hold
of
the
nurse
and
she
told
me
this
queer
tale
he
was
all
in
a
tremble
when
he
came
in
but
she
declares
he
had
not
been
drinking
he
went
immediately
to
the
bedside
but
his
sister
was
asleep
and
he
did
stay
there
but
went
over
where
the
nurse
was
and
began
to
hang
about
her
till
suddenly
she
felt
a
twitch
at
her
side
and
looking
quickly
saw
the
little
book
she
carries
there
falling
back
into
place
he
had
lifted
it
and
probably
read
what
she
had
written
in
it
during
his
absence
she
was
displeased
but
he
laughed
when
he
saw
that
he
had
been
caught
and
said
boldly
are
keeping
a
record
of
my
sister
ravings
well
i
think
i
as
interested
in
them
as
you
are
and
have
as
much
right
to
read
as
you
to
write
thank
god
they
are
innocent
enough
even
you
must
acknowledge
that
she
made
no
answer
for
they
were
innocent
enough
but
she
keep
the
book
away
from
him
after
this
of
that
you
may
be
sure
and
what
is
he
doing
now
is
he
going
into
his
own
room
no
he
went
there
but
only
to
bring
out
his
pillows
he
will
sleep
in
the
alcove
drink
no
not
a
drop
he
has
ordered
the
whiskey
locked
up
i
hear
him
moaning
sometimes
to
himself
as
if
he
missed
it
awfully
but
not
a
thimbleful
has
left
the
decanter
goodnight
hexford
good
night
you
heard
this
to
the
district
attorney
every
word
both
went
for
their
overcoats
only
on
leaving
did
they
speak
again
and
then
it
was
to
say
at
ten
morning
at
ten
xviii
on
it
was
written
can
this
avail
thee
look
to
it
the
district
attorney
was
right
sweetwater
was
not
happy
his
rest
had
not
benefited
him
he
had
seemed
natural
enough
when
he
first
appeared
at
the
coroner
office
in
the
early
morning
and
equally
natural
all
through
the
lengthy
conference
which
followed
but
a
half
hour
later
any
one
who
knew
him
well
any
of
his
fellow
detectives
in
new
york
especially
gryce
who
had
almost
fathered
him
since
he
came
among
them
a
raw
and
inexperienced
recruit
would
have
seen
at
first
glance
that
his
spirits
were
no
longer
at
par
and
that
the
cheer
he
displayed
in
manner
and
look
was
entirely
assumed
and
likely
to
disappear
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
alone
and
it
did
so
disappear
when
at
two
he
entered
the
grounds
it
was
without
buoyancy
or
any
of
the
natural
animation
with
which
he
usually
went
about
his
work
each
step
seemed
weighted
with
thought
or
at
least
heavy
with
inner
dissatisfaction
but
his
eye
was
as
keen
as
ever
and
he
began
to
use
that
eye
from
the
moment
he
passed
the
gates
what
was
in
his
mind
was
he
hunting
for
new
clews
or
was
he
merely
seeking
to
establish
the
old
the
officers
on
guard
knew
him
by
this
time
and
let
him
pass
hither
thither
and
where
he
would
unmolested
he
walked
up
and
down
the
driveways
peering
continuously
at
the
snow
he
studied
the
spaces
between
he
sauntered
to
the
rear
and
looked
out
over
the
then
he
began
to
study
the
ground
in
this
direction
as
he
had
already
studied
it
in
front
the
few
mutterings
which
left
his
lips
continued
to
speak
of
discontent
if
i
had
only
had
clarke
chance
or
even
hexford
was
among
his
complaints
but
what
can
i
hope
now
the
snow
has
been
trampled
till
it
is
one
solid
cake
of
ice
to
the
very
edge
of
the
beyond
that
the
distance
is
too
great
for
minute
inspection
yet
it
will
have
to
be
gone
over
inch
by
inch
before
i
shall
feel
satisfied
i
must
know
how
much
of
his
story
is
to
be
believed
and
how
much
of
it
we
can
safely
set
aside
he
ended
by
wandering
down
on
the
taking
out
his
watch
he
satisfied
himself
that
he
had
time
for
an
experiment
and
immediately
started
for
cuthbert
road
an
hour
later
he
came
wandering
back
on
a
different
line
he
looked
soured
disappointed
when
near
the
building
again
he
cast
his
eye
over
its
rear
and
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
the
window
which
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
as
the
one
from
which
a
possible
light
had
shone
forth
that
night
there
were
no
trees
on
this
side
of
the
house
only
vines
but
the
vines
were
bare
of
leaves
and
offered
no
obstruction
to
his
view
if
there
had
been
a
light
in
that
window
any
one
leaving
this
house
by
the
rear
would
have
seen
it
unless
he
had
been
drunk
or
a
fool
muttered
sweetwater
in
contemptuous
comment
to
himself
arthur
cumberland
story
is
one
lie
i
take
the
district
attorney
suggestion
and
return
to
new
york
my
work
done
here
yet
he
hung
about
the
links
for
a
long
time
and
finally
ended
by
entering
the
house
and
taking
up
his
stand
beneath
the
long
narrow
window
of
the
closet
overlooking
the
with
chin
resting
on
his
arms
he
stared
out
over
the
sill
and
sought
from
the
space
before
him
and
from
the
intricacies
of
his
own
mind
the
hint
he
lacked
to
make
this
present
solution
of
the
case
satisfactory
to
all
his
instincts
something
is
lacking
thus
he
blurted
out
after
a
look
behind
him
into
the
adjoining
room
of
death
i
ca
say
what
nor
can
i
explain
my
own
unrest
or
my
disinclination
to
leave
this
spot
the
district
attorney
is
satisfied
and
so
i
afraid
is
the
coroner
but
i
not
and
i
feel
as
guilty
here
he
threw
open
the
window
for
air
and
thrusting
his
head
out
glanced
over
the
links
then
aside
at
the
pines
showing
beyond
the
line
of
the
house
on
the
southern
end
and
then
out
of
mere
idleness
down
at
the
ground
beneath
him
as
guilty
he
went
on
as
ranelagh
appears
to
be
and
some
one
really
is
i
starting
he
leaned
farther
out
what
was
that
he
saw
in
the
vines
not
on
the
snow
of
the
ground
but
half
way
up
in
the
tangle
of
small
branches
clinging
close
to
the
stone
of
the
lower
story
just
beneath
this
window
he
would
see
something
that
glistened
something
that
could
only
have
got
there
by
falling
from
this
window
could
he
reach
it
no
he
would
have
to
climb
up
from
below
to
do
that
well
that
was
easy
enough
with
the
thought
he
rushed
from
the
room
in
another
minute
he
was
beneath
that
window
had
climbed
pulled
pushed
his
way
up
had
found
the
little
pocket
of
netted
vines
observable
from
above
had
thrust
in
his
fingers
and
worked
a
small
object
out
had
looked
at
it
uttered
an
exclamation
curious
in
its
mixture
of
suppressed
emotions
and
let
himself
down
again
into
the
midst
of
the
two
or
three
men
who
had
scented
the
adventure
and
hastened
to
be
witnesses
of
its
outcome
a
phial
he
exclaimed
an
empty
phial
but
holding
the
little
bottle
up
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
he
turned
it
slowly
about
until
the
label
faced
them
on
it
was
written
one
word
but
it
was
a
word
which
invariably
carries
alarm
with
it
that
word
was
sweetwater
did
not
return
to
new
york
that
night
xix
it
not
what
you
will
find
i
am
not
mad
i
would
to
heaven
i
were
for
then
is
like
i
should
forget
myself
o
if
i
could
what
grief
should
i
forget
preach
some
philosophy
to
make
me
mad
for
being
not
mad
but
sensible
of
grief
my
reasonable
part
produces
reason
how
i
may
be
delivered
of
these
woes
i
regret
to
disturb
you
arthur
but
my
business
is
of
great
importance
and
should
be
made
known
to
you
at
once
this
i
say
as
a
friend
i
might
have
waited
for
the
report
to
have
reached
you
from
hearsay
or
through
the
evening
papers
but
i
preferred
to
be
the
one
to
tell
you
you
can
understand
why
sullen
and
unmollified
the
young
man
thus
addressed
eyed
apprehensively
his
father
old
friend
placed
so
unfortunately
in
his
regard
and
morosely
exclaimed
out
with
it
i
a
poor
hand
at
guessing
what
has
happened
now
a
discovery
a
somewhat
serious
one
i
fear
at
least
it
will
force
the
police
to
new
action
your
sister
may
not
have
died
entirely
from
strangulation
other
causes
may
have
been
at
work
now
what
do
you
mean
by
that
arthur
cumberland
was
under
his
own
roof
and
in
presence
of
one
who
should
have
inspired
his
respect
but
he
made
no
effort
to
hide
the
fury
which
these
words
called
up
i
should
like
to
know
what
deviltry
is
in
your
minds
now
am
i
never
to
have
peace
peace
and
tragedy
do
not
often
run
together
came
in
the
mild
tones
of
his
friend
a
great
crime
has
taken
place
all
the
members
of
this
family
are
involved
to
say
nothing
of
the
man
who
lies
now
under
the
odium
of
suspicion
in
our
common
county
jail
peace
can
only
come
with
the
complete
clearing
up
of
this
crime
and
the
punishment
of
the
guilty
but
the
clearing
up
must
antedate
the
punishment
assertion
that
he
found
miss
cumberland
dead
when
he
approached
her
may
not
be
as
so
many
now
believe
the
reckless
denial
of
a
criminal
disturbed
in
his
act
it
may
have
had
a
basis
in
fact
i
do
believe
it
nothing
will
make
me
believe
it
stormed
the
other
jumping
up
and
wildly
pacing
the
floor
it
is
all
a
scheme
for
saving
the
most
popular
man
in
society
society
that
for
society
he
shouted
out
snapping
his
fingers
he
is
president
of
the
club
the
pet
of
women
the
admired
of
all
the
dolts
and
gawks
who
are
taken
with
his
style
his
easy
laughter
and
his
knack
at
getting
at
men
hearts
he
wo
laugh
so
easily
when
he
up
before
a
jury
for
murder
and
never
again
fool
women
or
bulldoze
men
even
if
they
are
weak
enough
to
acquit
him
of
this
crime
enough
of
the
smirch
will
stick
to
prevent
that
if
it
does
i
again
his
hands
went
out
in
the
horribly
suggestive
way
they
had
done
at
his
sister
funeral
the
coroner
sat
appalled
confused
almost
distracted
between
his
doubts
his
convictions
his
sympathy
for
the
man
and
his
recoil
from
the
passions
he
would
be
only
too
ready
to
pardon
if
he
could
feel
quite
sure
of
their
real
root
and
motive
cumberland
may
have
felt
the
other
silence
or
he
may
have
realised
the
imprudence
of
his
own
fury
for
he
dropped
his
hands
with
an
impatient
sigh
and
blurted
out
but
you
have
told
me
your
discovery
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
little
late
to
make
discoveries
now
this
was
brought
about
by
the
persistence
of
sweetwater
he
seems
to
have
an
instinct
for
things
he
was
leaning
out
of
the
window
at
the
rear
of
the
clubhouse
the
window
of
that
small
room
where
your
sister
coat
was
found
and
he
saw
caught
in
the
vines
beneath
a
why
do
you
speak
out
i
can
not
tell
what
he
found
unless
you
name
it
a
little
bottle
an
apothecary
phial
it
was
labelled
and
it
came
from
this
house
arthur
cumberland
reeled
then
he
caught
himself
up
and
stood
staring
with
a
very
obvious
intent
of
getting
a
grip
on
himself
before
he
spoke
the
coroner
waited
a
slight
flush
deepening
on
his
cheek
how
do
you
know
that
phial
came
from
this
house
perry
looked
up
astonished
he
was
prepared
for
the
most
frantic
ebullitions
of
wrath
for
violence
even
or
for
dull
stupid
blank
silence
but
this
calm
quiet
questioning
of
fact
took
him
by
surprise
he
dropped
his
anxious
look
and
replied
it
has
been
seen
on
the
shelves
by
more
than
one
of
your
servants
your
sister
kept
it
with
her
medicines
and
the
druggist
with
whom
you
deal
remembers
selling
it
some
time
ago
to
a
member
of
your
family
which
member
i
do
believe
this
story
i
do
believe
any
of
your
he
was
fast
verging
on
violence
now
you
will
have
to
arthur
facts
are
facts
and
we
can
not
go
against
them
the
person
who
bought
it
was
yourself
perhaps
you
can
recall
the
circumstance
now
i
can
not
he
did
not
seem
to
be
quite
master
of
himself
i
do
know
half
the
things
i
do
at
least
i
did
use
to
but
what
are
you
coming
to
what
in
your
mind
and
what
are
your
intentions
something
to
shame
us
further
i
no
doubt
you
soft
on
ranelagh
and
do
care
how
i
feel
or
how
carmel
will
feel
when
she
comes
to
herself
poor
girl
are
you
going
to
call
it
suicide
you
ca
with
those
marks
on
her
throat
we
going
to
carry
out
our
investigations
to
the
full
we
going
to
hold
the
autopsy
which
we
did
think
necessary
before
that
why
i
am
here
arthur
i
thought
it
your
due
to
know
our
intentions
in
regard
to
this
matter
if
you
wish
to
be
present
you
have
only
to
say
so
if
you
do
not
you
may
trust
me
to
remember
that
she
was
your
father
daughter
as
well
as
my
own
highly
esteemed
friend
shaken
to
the
core
the
young
man
sat
down
amid
innumerable
tokens
of
the
two
near
if
not
dear
ones
just
mentioned
and
for
a
moment
had
nothing
to
say
gone
was
his
violence
gone
his
and
his
insolent
captious
attitude
towards
his
visitor
the
net
had
been
drawn
too
tightly
or
the
blow
fallen
too
heavily
he
was
no
longer
a
man
struggling
with
his
misery
but
a
boy
on
whom
had
fallen
a
responsibilities
sufferings
and
cares
my
duty
is
here
he
said
at
last
i
can
not
leave
carmel
the
autopsy
will
take
place
how
is
carmel
no
better
the
words
came
with
a
shudder
doctor
i
been
a
brute
to
you
i
am
a
brute
i
have
misused
my
life
and
have
no
strength
with
which
to
meet
trouble
what
you
propose
to
do
with
with
adelaide
is
horrible
to
me
i
did
love
her
much
while
she
was
living
i
broke
her
heart
and
shamed
her
from
morning
till
night
every
day
of
her
life
but
as
i
am
and
as
i
always
been
if
i
could
save
her
body
this
last
humiliation
i
would
willingly
die
right
here
and
now
and
be
done
with
it
must
this
autopsy
take
place
it
must
then
he
raised
his
arm
the
blood
swept
up
dyeing
his
cheeks
his
brow
his
very
neck
a
vivid
scarlet
tell
them
to
lock
up
every
bottle
the
house
holds
or
i
can
not
answer
for
myself
i
should
like
to
drink
and
drink
till
i
knew
nothing
cared
for
nothing
was
a
madman
or
a
beast
you
will
not
drink
the
coroner
voice
rang
deep
he
was
greatly
moved
you
will
not
drink
and
you
will
come
to
the
office
at
five
we
may
have
only
good
news
to
impart
we
may
find
nothing
to
complicate
the
situation
arthur
cumberland
shook
his
head
it
not
what
you
will
find
said
he
and
stopped
biting
his
lips
and
looking
down
the
coroner
uttered
a
few
words
of
consolation
forced
from
him
by
the
painfulness
of
the
situation
the
young
man
did
not
seem
to
hear
them
the
only
sign
of
life
he
gave
was
to
rush
away
the
moment
the
coroner
had
taken
his
leave
and
regain
his
seat
within
sight
and
hearing
of
his
still
unconscious
sister
as
he
did
so
these
words
came
to
his
ears
through
the
door
which
separated
them
flowers
i
smell
flowers
lila
you
always
loved
flowers
but
i
never
saw
your
hands
so
full
of
them
arthur
uttered
a
sharp
cry
then
bowing
his
face
upon
his
aims
he
broke
into
sobs
which
shook
the
table
where
he
sat
hours
later
in
the
coroner
office
sat
an
anxious
group
discussing
the
great
case
and
the
possible
revelations
awaiting
them
the
district
attorney
clifton
the
chief
of
police
and
one
or
two
others
among
them
sweetwater
made
up
the
group
and
carried
on
the
conversation
perry
only
was
absent
he
had
undertaken
to
make
the
autopsy
and
had
been
absent
for
this
purpose
several
hours
five
had
struck
and
they
were
momentarily
looking
for
his
reappearance
but
when
the
door
opened
as
it
did
at
this
time
it
was
to
admit
young
cumberland
whose
white
face
and
shaking
limbs
betrayed
his
suspense
and
nervous
anxiety
he
was
welcomed
coldly
but
not
impolitely
and
sat
down
in
very
much
the
same
place
he
had
occupied
during
his
last
visit
but
in
a
very
different
and
much
more
quiet
state
of
mind
to
sweetwater
his
aspect
was
one
of
despair
but
be
made
no
remark
upon
it
only
kept
all
his
senses
alert
for
the
coming
moment
of
so
much
importance
to
them
all
but
even
he
failed
to
guess
how
important
until
the
door
opened
again
and
the
coroner
appeared
looking
not
so
much
depressed
as
stunned
picking
out
arthur
from
the
group
he
advanced
towards
him
with
some
commonplace
remark
but
desisted
suddenly
and
turned
upon
the
others
instead
i
have
finished
the
autopsy
said
he
i
knew
just
what
poison
the
phial
had
held
and
lost
no
time
in
my
tests
a
minute
portion
of
this
drug
which
is
dangerous
only
in
large
quantities
was
found
in
the
stomach
of
the
deceased
but
not
enough
to
cause
serious
trouble
and
she
died
as
we
had
already
decided
from
the
effect
of
the
murderous
clutch
upon
her
throat
but
he
went
on
sternly
as
young
cumberland
moved
and
showed
signs
of
breaking
in
with
one
of
his
violent
invectives
against
the
supposed
assassin
i
made
another
discovery
of
still
greater
purport
when
we
lifted
the
body
out
of
its
something
beside
withered
flowers
slid
from
her
breast
and
fell
at
our
feet
the
ring
gentlemen
the
ring
which
ranelagh
says
was
missing
from
her
hand
when
he
came
upon
her
and
which
certainly
was
not
on
her
finger
when
she
was
laid
in
the
casket
rolled
to
the
floor
when
we
moved
her
here
it
is
there
is
one
person
here
at
least
who
can
identify
it
but
i
do
not
ask
that
person
to
speak
that
we
may
well
spare
him
he
laid
the
ring
on
the
table
not
too
near
arthur
not
within
reach
of
his
hand
but
close
enough
for
him
to
see
it
then
he
sat
down
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
the
last
few
days
had
told
on
him
he
looked
older
by
ten
years
than
he
had
at
the
beginning
of
the
month
the
silence
which
followed
these
words
and
this
action
was
memorable
to
everybody
there
concerned
some
had
seen
and
all
had
heard
of
young
cumberland
desperate
interruption
of
the
funeral
and
the
way
his
hand
had
invaded
the
flowers
which
the
children
had
cast
in
upon
her
breast
as
the
picture
real
or
fancied
rose
before
their
eyes
one
man
rose
and
left
his
place
at
the
table
then
another
and
presently
another
even
charles
clifton
drew
back
the
district
attorney
remained
where
he
was
and
so
did
young
cumberland
the
latter
had
reached
out
his
hand
but
he
had
not
touched
the
ring
and
he
sat
thus
frozen
what
went
on
in
his
heart
no
man
there
could
guess
and
he
did
not
enlighten
them
when
at
last
he
looked
up
it
was
with
a
dazed
air
and
an
almost
humble
mien
providence
has
me
this
time
he
muttered
i
do
understand
these
mysteries
you
will
have
to
deal
with
them
as
you
think
best
his
eyes
still
glued
to
the
jewel
dilated
and
filled
with
fierce
light
as
he
said
this
damn
the
ring
and
damn
the
man
who
gave
it
to
her
however
it
came
into
her
casket
he
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
just
as
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
her
death
if
you
think
anything
else
you
will
think
a
lie
turning
away
he
made
for
the
door
there
was
in
his
manner
desperation
approaching
to
bravado
but
no
man
made
the
least
effort
to
detain
him
not
till
he
was
well
out
of
the
room
did
any
one
move
then
the
district
attorney
raised
his
finger
and
arthur
cumberland
did
not
ride
back
to
his
home
alone
book
three
hidden
surprises
xx
he
or
you
there
is
no
third
a
heavy
summons
lies
like
lead
upon
me
and
yet
i
would
not
sleep
merciful
powers
restrain
in
me
the
cursed
thoughts
that
nature
gives
way
to
in
repose
for
several
days
i
had
been
ill
they
were
merciful
days
to
me
since
i
was
far
too
weak
for
thought
then
there
came
a
period
of
conscious
rest
then
renewed
interest
in
life
and
my
own
fate
and
reputation
what
had
happened
during
this
interval
i
had
a
confused
memory
of
having
seen
clifton
face
at
my
bedside
but
i
was
sure
that
no
words
had
passed
between
us
when
would
he
come
again
when
should
i
hear
about
carmel
and
whether
she
were
yet
alive
or
mercifully
dead
like
her
sister
i
might
read
the
papers
but
they
had
been
carefully
kept
from
me
not
one
was
in
sight
the
nurse
would
undoubtedly
give
me
the
information
i
desired
but
kind
as
she
had
been
i
dreaded
to
consult
a
stranger
about
matters
which
involved
my
very
existence
and
every
remaining
hope
yet
i
must
know
for
i
could
not
help
thinking
now
and
i
dreaded
to
think
amiss
and
pile
up
misery
for
myself
when
i
needed
support
and
consolation
i
would
risk
one
question
but
no
more
i
would
ask
about
the
inquest
had
it
been
held
if
she
said
yes
ah
if
she
said
yes
i
should
know
that
carmel
was
dead
and
the
news
coming
thus
would
kill
me
so
i
asked
nothing
and
was
lying
in
a
sufficiently
feverish
condition
when
the
doctor
came
in
saw
my
state
and
thinking
to
cheer
me
up
remarked
blandly
you
are
well
enough
this
morning
to
hear
good
news
do
you
recognise
the
room
you
are
in
i
in
the
hospital
am
i
not
hardly
you
are
in
one
of
own
rooms
was
the
head
keeper
you
are
detained
now
simply
as
a
witness
i
was
struck
to
the
heart
terrified
in
an
instant
what
why
what
has
happened
i
questioned
rapidly
half
starting
up
then
falling
back
on
my
pillow
under
his
astonished
eye
nothing
he
parried
seeing
his
mistake
and
resorting
to
the
soothing
process
they
simply
have
had
time
to
think
you
not
the
sort
of
man
from
which
criminals
are
made
that
nonsense
i
retorted
reckless
of
his
opinion
and
mad
to
know
the
truth
yet
shrinking
horribly
from
it
criminals
are
made
from
all
kinds
of
men
neither
are
the
police
so
philosophical
something
has
occurred
but
do
tell
me
i
protested
inconsistently
as
he
opened
his
lips
send
for
clifton
he
my
friend
i
can
better
bear
here
he
is
said
the
doctor
as
the
door
softly
opened
under
the
nurse
careful
hand
i
looked
up
saw
charles
faithful
face
and
stretched
out
my
hand
without
speaking
never
had
i
needed
a
friend
more
and
never
had
i
been
more
constrained
in
my
greeting
i
feared
to
show
my
real
heart
my
real
fears
my
real
reason
for
not
hailing
my
release
as
every
one
evidently
expected
me
to
with
a
gesture
to
the
nurse
the
doctor
tiptoed
out
muttering
to
clifton
as
he
passed
some
word
of
warning
or
casual
instruction
the
nurse
followed
and
clifton
coming
forward
took
a
seat
at
my
side
he
was
cheerful
but
not
too
cheerful
and
the
air
of
slight
constraint
which
tinged
his
manner
as
much
as
it
did
mine
did
not
escape
me
well
old
fellow
he
began
my
hand
went
up
in
entreaty
tell
me
why
they
have
withdrawn
their
suspicions
i
heard
nothing
read
nothing
for
days
i
do
understand
this
move
for
reply
he
laid
his
hand
on
mine
you
stanch
he
began
you
have
my
regard
elwood
not
many
men
would
have
stood
the
racket
and
sacrificed
themselves
as
you
have
done
the
fact
is
recognised
now
and
your
motive
i
must
have
turned
very
white
for
he
stopped
and
sprang
to
his
feet
searching
for
some
restorative
i
felt
the
need
of
blinding
him
to
my
condition
with
an
effort
which
shook
me
from
head
to
foot
i
lifted
myself
from
the
depths
into
which
his
words
had
plunged
me
and
fighting
for
faltered
forth
feebly
enough
do
be
frightened
i
all
right
again
i
guess
i
not
very
strong
yet
sit
down
i
do
need
anything
he
turned
and
surveyed
me
carefully
and
finding
my
colour
restored
reseated
himself
and
proceeded
more
circumspectly
perhaps
i
had
better
wait
till
before
i
satisfy
your
curiosity
said
he
and
leave
me
to
imagine
all
sorts
of
horrors
no
tell
me
at
once
is
is
has
anything
happened
at
the
cumberlands
yes
what
you
feared
has
happened
no
no
carmel
is
not
dead
did
you
think
i
meant
that
forgive
me
i
should
have
remembered
that
you
had
other
causes
for
anxiety
than
the
one
weighing
on
our
minds
she
is
holding
her
own
just
holding
it
but
that
is
something
in
one
so
young
and
naturally
healthy
i
could
see
that
i
baffled
him
it
could
not
be
helped
i
did
not
dare
to
utter
the
question
with
which
my
whole
soul
was
full
i
could
only
look
my
entreaty
he
misunderstood
it
as
was
natural
enough
she
does
not
know
yet
what
is
in
store
for
her
were
his
words
and
i
could
only
lie
still
and
look
at
him
helplessly
and
try
not
to
show
the
despair
that
was
sinking
me
deeper
and
deeper
into
when
she
comes
to
herself
she
will
have
to
be
told
but
you
will
be
on
your
feet
then
and
will
be
allowed
no
doubt
to
soften
the
blow
for
her
by
your
comfort
and
counsel
the
fact
that
it
must
have
been
you
if
not
he
did
i
shout
it
or
was
the
shout
simply
in
my
own
mind
i
trembled
as
i
rose
on
my
elbow
i
searched
his
face
in
terror
of
my
but
his
showed
only
compassion
and
an
eager
desire
to
clear
the
air
between
us
by
telling
me
the
exact
facts
yes
arthur
his
guilt
has
not
been
proven
he
has
not
even
been
remanded
the
sister
case
is
too
pitiful
and
coroner
perry
too
where
any
of
that
family
is
involved
but
no
one
doubts
his
guilt
and
he
does
not
deny
it
himself
you
know
probably
no
one
better
that
he
can
not
very
consistently
do
this
in
face
of
the
evidence
accumulated
against
him
evidence
stronger
in
many
regards
than
that
accumulated
against
yourself
the
ungrateful
boy
the
the
pardon
me
i
do
often
indulge
in
invectives
against
unhappy
men
who
have
their
punishment
before
them
but
i
was
thinking
of
you
and
what
you
have
suffered
in
this
jail
where
you
have
not
belonged
no
not
for
a
day
do
think
of
me
the
words
came
with
a
gasp
i
was
never
so
hard
put
to
it
not
when
i
first
realised
that
i
had
been
seen
with
my
fingers
on
adelaide
throat
arthur
a
booby
and
a
boor
but
certainly
not
the
slayer
of
his
sister
unless
i
had
been
woefully
mistaken
in
all
that
had
taken
place
in
that
previous
to
my
entrance
into
it
on
that
fatal
night
as
i
caught
clifton
eye
fixed
upon
me
i
repeated
though
with
more
i
hope
do
think
of
me
i
not
thinking
of
myself
you
speak
of
evidence
what
evidence
give
me
details
do
you
see
that
i
am
burning
with
curiosity
i
sha
be
myself
till
i
hear
this
alarmed
him
it
a
risk
said
he
the
doctor
told
me
to
be
careful
not
to
excite
you
too
much
but
suspense
is
always
more
intolerable
than
certainty
and
you
have
heard
too
much
to
be
left
in
ignorance
of
the
rest
yes
yes
i
agreed
feverishly
pressing
his
hand
it
all
came
about
through
you
he
blundered
on
you
told
me
of
the
fellow
you
saw
riding
away
from
the
whispering
pines
at
the
time
you
entered
the
grounds
i
passed
the
story
on
to
the
coroner
and
he
to
a
new
york
detective
they
have
put
on
this
case
he
and
arthur
own
surly
nature
did
the
rest
i
cringed
where
i
lay
this
was
my
work
the
person
who
drove
out
of
the
grounds
while
i
stood
in
the
hall
was
carmel
and
the
clew
i
had
given
instead
of
baffling
and
confusing
them
had
led
directly
to
arthur
seeing
nothing
peculiar
or
at
all
events
giving
no
evidence
of
having
noted
anything
peculiar
in
my
movement
clifton
went
evenly
on
pouring
into
my
astonished
ears
the
whole
long
story
of
this
investigations
i
heard
of
his
visit
at
the
mechanic
cottage
and
of
the
identification
of
the
hat
marked
by
eliza
simmons
floury
thumb
with
an
old
one
of
arthur
fished
out
from
one
of
the
cumberland
closets
then
as
i
lay
dumb
in
my
secret
dismay
and
perturbation
of
arthur
acknowledged
visit
to
the
and
his
abstraction
of
the
bottles
which
to
all
minds
save
my
own
perhaps
connected
him
directly
and
unmistakably
with
the
crime
the
finger
of
god
nothing
else
such
coincidences
can
not
be
natural
was
my
thought
and
i
braced
myself
to
meet
the
further
disclosures
i
saw
awaiting
me
but
when
these
disclosures
were
made
and
arthur
conduct
at
the
funeral
was
given
its
natural
explanation
by
the
finding
of
the
ring
in
adelaide
casket
i
was
so
affected
both
by
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
facts
and
the
doubtful
position
in
which
they
seemed
to
place
one
whom
even
now
i
found
it
difficult
to
believe
guilty
of
adelaide
death
that
clifton
aroused
in
spite
of
his
own
excitement
to
a
sudden
realisation
of
my
condition
bounded
to
his
feet
and
impetuously
cried
out
i
had
to
tell
you
it
was
your
due
and
you
would
not
have
been
satisfied
if
i
had
not
but
i
fear
that
i
rushed
my
narrative
too
suddenly
upon
you
that
you
needed
more
preparation
and
that
the
greatest
kindness
i
can
show
you
now
is
to
leave
before
i
do
further
mischief
i
believe
i
answered
i
know
that
his
idea
of
leaving
was
insupportable
to
me
that
i
wanted
him
to
stay
until
i
had
had
time
to
think
and
adjust
myself
to
these
new
conditions
instinctively
i
did
not
feel
as
certain
of
arthur
guilt
as
he
did
my
own
case
had
taught
me
the
insufficiency
of
circumstantial
evidence
to
settle
a
mooted
fact
besides
i
knew
arthur
even
better
than
i
did
his
sisters
he
was
as
full
of
faults
and
as
lacking
in
amiable
and
reliable
traits
as
any
fellow
of
my
acquaintance
but
he
had
not
the
inherent
snap
which
makes
for
crime
he
lacked
the
vigour
which
god
forgive
me
the
thought
lay
back
of
carmers
softer
characteristics
i
could
not
imagine
him
guilty
i
could
for
all
my
love
imagine
his
sister
so
and
did
the
conviction
would
not
leave
my
mind
charles
said
i
at
last
struggling
for
calmness
and
succeeding
better
in
my
task
than
either
he
or
i
expected
what
motive
do
they
assign
for
this
deed
why
should
arthur
follow
adelaide
to
the
and
kill
her
now
if
he
had
followed
me
you
were
at
dinner
with
them
that
night
and
know
what
she
did
and
what
she
vowed
about
the
wine
he
was
very
angry
though
he
dropped
his
glass
and
let
it
shiver
on
the
board
he
himself
says
that
he
was
desperately
put
out
with
her
and
could
only
drown
his
mad
emotions
in
drink
he
knew
that
she
would
hear
of
it
if
he
went
to
any
saloon
in
town
so
he
stole
the
key
from
your
bunch
and
went
to
help
himself
out
of
the
that
how
he
came
to
be
there
what
followed
who
knows
he
wo
tell
and
we
can
only
conjecture
the
ring
which
she
certainly
wore
that
night
might
give
the
secret
away
but
it
is
not
gifted
with
speech
though
as
a
silent
witness
it
is
exceedingly
eloquent
the
episode
of
the
ring
confused
me
i
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
could
not
connect
it
with
what
i
myself
knew
of
the
confused
experiences
of
that
night
but
i
could
recall
the
dinner
and
the
sullen
aspect
not
unmixed
with
awe
with
which
this
boy
contemplated
his
sister
when
his
own
glass
fell
from
his
nerveless
fingers
my
own
heart
was
not
in
the
business
it
was
on
the
elopement
i
had
planned
but
i
could
not
help
seeing
what
i
have
just
mentioned
and
it
recurred
to
me
now
with
fatal
distinctness
the
awe
was
as
great
as
the
sullenness
did
that
offer
a
good
foundation
for
crime
i
disliked
arthur
i
had
no
use
for
the
boy
and
i
wished
with
all
my
heart
to
detect
guilt
in
his
actions
rather
than
in
those
of
the
woman
i
loved
but
i
could
not
forget
that
tinge
of
awe
on
features
too
heavy
to
mirror
very
readily
the
nicer
feelings
of
the
human
soul
it
would
come
up
and
under
the
influence
of
this
impression
i
said
are
you
sure
that
he
made
no
denial
of
this
crime
that
does
not
seem
like
arthur
guilty
or
innocent
he
made
none
in
my
presence
and
i
was
in
the
coroner
office
when
the
ring
was
produced
from
its
secret
and
set
down
before
him
there
was
no
open
accusation
made
but
he
must
have
understood
the
silence
of
all
present
he
acknowledged
some
days
ago
when
confronted
with
the
bottle
found
in
cuthbert
road
that
he
had
taken
both
it
and
another
from
the
just
before
the
storm
began
to
rage
that
night
the
hour
the
very
hour
i
muttered
he
entered
and
left
by
that
upper
hall
window
or
so
he
says
but
he
is
not
to
be
believed
in
all
his
statements
some
of
his
declarations
we
know
to
be
false
which
ones
give
me
a
specimen
charlie
mention
something
he
has
said
that
you
know
to
be
false
well
it
is
hard
to
accuse
a
man
of
a
direct
lie
but
he
can
not
be
telling
the
truth
when
he
says
that
he
crossed
the
links
immediately
to
cuthbert
road
thus
cutting
out
the
ride
home
of
which
we
have
such
extraordinary
proof
under
the
fear
of
betraying
my
thoughts
i
hurriedly
closed
my
eyes
i
was
in
an
extraordinary
position
myself
what
seemed
falsehood
to
them
struck
me
as
the
absolute
truth
carmel
had
been
the
one
to
go
home
he
without
doubt
had
crossed
the
links
as
he
said
as
this
conviction
penetrated
deeply
and
yet
more
deeply
into
my
mind
i
shrank
inexpressibly
from
the
renewed
mental
struggle
into
which
it
plunged
me
to
have
suffered
myself
to
have
fallen
under
the
ban
of
suspicion
and
the
disgrace
of
arrest
had
certainly
been
hard
but
it
was
nothing
to
beholding
another
in
the
same
plight
through
my
own
rash
and
attempt
to
better
my
position
and
carmel
by
what
i
had
considered
a
totally
harmless
subterfuge
i
shuddered
as
i
anticipated
the
sleepless
hours
of
silent
debate
which
lay
before
me
the
voice
which
whispered
that
arthur
cumberland
was
not
with
sensitiveness
and
would
not
feel
the
shame
of
his
position
like
another
did
not
carry
with
it
an
indisputable
message
and
could
not
impose
on
my
conscience
for
more
than
a
passing
moment
the
lout
was
human
and
i
could
not
stifle
my
convictions
in
his
favour
but
carmel
i
clenched
my
hands
under
the
clothes
i
wished
it
were
not
high
noon
but
dark
night
that
clifton
would
only
arise
or
turn
his
eyes
away
that
something
or
anything
might
happen
to
give
me
an
instant
of
solitary
contemplation
without
the
threatening
possibility
of
beholding
my
thoughts
and
feelings
reflected
in
another
mind
was
this
review
instantaneous
or
the
work
of
many
minutes
forced
by
the
doubt
to
open
my
eyes
i
met
clifton
full
look
turned
watchfully
on
me
the
result
was
calming
even
to
my
apprehensive
gaze
it
betrayed
no
new
enlightenment
my
struggle
had
been
all
within
no
token
of
it
had
reached
him
this
he
showed
still
more
plainly
when
he
spoke
there
will
be
a
close
sifting
of
evidence
at
the
inquest
you
will
not
enjoy
this
but
the
situation
hard
as
it
may
prove
has
certainly
improved
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
that
should
hasten
your
convalescence
poor
arthur
burst
from
my
lips
and
the
cry
was
echoed
in
my
heart
then
because
i
could
no
longer
endure
the
pusillanimity
which
kept
me
silent
i
rose
impulsively
into
a
sitting
posture
and
summoning
all
my
faculties
into
full
play
endeavoured
to
put
my
finger
on
the
one
weak
point
in
the
evidence
thus
raised
against
carmel
brother
what
sort
of
a
man
would
you
make
arthur
out
to
be
when
you
accuse
him
of
robbing
the
on
top
of
a
murderous
assault
on
his
sister
i
know
it
argues
a
brute
but
he
arthur
cumberland
is
selfish
unresponsive
and
hard
but
he
is
not
a
brute
i
disposed
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
my
good
opinion
to
this
extent
charlie
i
can
not
believe
he
first
poisoned
and
then
choked
that
noble
woman
clifton
drew
himself
up
in
his
turn
astonishment
battling
with
renewed
distrust
either
he
or
you
ranelagh
he
exclaimed
firmly
there
is
no
third
person
this
you
must
realise
xxi
carmel
awakes
one
woe
doth
tread
upon
another
heel
so
fast
they
follow
later
i
asked
myself
many
questions
and
wandered
into
mazes
of
speculation
which
only
puzzled
me
and
led
nowhere
i
remembered
the
bottles
i
remembered
the
ring
i
went
back
in
fancy
to
the
hour
of
my
own
entrance
into
the
and
recalling
each
circumstance
endeavoured
to
fit
the
facts
of
arthur
story
with
those
of
my
own
experience
was
he
in
the
building
when
i
first
stepped
into
it
it
was
just
possible
i
had
been
led
to
prevaricate
as
to
the
moment
i
entered
the
lower
gateway
and
he
may
have
done
the
same
as
to
the
hour
he
left
by
the
upper
hall
window
whatever
his
denials
on
this
or
any
subject
i
was
convinced
that
he
knew
as
well
as
i
that
carmel
had
been
in
the
building
with
her
sister
and
was
involved
more
or
less
personally
in
the
crime
committed
there
might
it
not
be
simply
as
his
accessory
after
the
fact
if
only
i
could
believe
this
if
my
knowledge
of
him
and
of
her
would
allow
me
to
hug
this
forlorn
hope
and
behold
in
this
shock
to
her
brain
and
in
her
look
and
attitude
on
leaving
the
only
a
sister
horror
at
a
wilful
brother
crime
but
one
fact
stood
in
the
way
of
this
a
fact
which
nothing
but
some
predetermined
underhanded
purpose
on
her
part
could
explain
she
had
gone
in
disguise
to
the
whispering
pines
and
she
had
returned
home
in
the
same
suspicious
fashion
the
wearing
of
her
brother
hat
and
coat
over
her
own
womanly
garments
was
no
freak
there
had
been
purpose
in
it
a
purpose
which
demanded
secrecy
that
adelaide
should
have
accompanied
her
under
these
circumstances
was
a
mystery
but
then
the
whole
affair
was
a
mystery
totally
out
of
keeping
in
all
its
details
with
the
characters
of
these
women
save
and
what
a
fearful
exception
i
here
make
the
awful
end
which
alas
bespoke
the
fiery
rush
and
impulse
to
destroy
which
marked
carmel
unbridled
rages
of
a
less
emotional
attack
she
would
be
as
incapable
as
any
other
good
woman
poison
she
would
never
use
its
presence
there
was
due
to
another
forethought
another
determination
but
the
poison
had
not
killed
both
glasses
had
been
emptied
but
ah
those
glasses
what
explanation
had
the
police
now
for
those
two
emptied
glasses
they
had
hitherto
supposed
me
to
be
the
second
person
who
had
joined
adelaide
in
this
totally
uncharacteristic
drinking
to
whom
did
they
now
attribute
this
act
to
arthur
the
brother
whose
love
for
liquor
in
every
form
she
had
always
decried
and
had
publicly
rebuked
only
a
few
hours
before
knowing
nothing
of
carmel
having
been
on
the
scene
they
must
ascribe
this
act
either
to
him
or
to
me
and
when
they
came
to
dwell
upon
this
point
more
particularly
when
they
came
to
study
the
exact
character
of
the
relations
which
had
always
subsisted
between
adelaide
and
her
brother
they
must
see
the
improbability
of
her
drinking
with
him
under
any
circumstances
then
their
thoughts
would
recur
to
me
and
i
should
find
myself
again
a
suspect
the
monstrous
suggestion
that
arthur
had
brought
the
liquor
there
himself
had
poured
it
out
and
forced
her
to
drink
it
poison
and
all
out
of
revenge
for
her
action
at
the
a
short
time
before
did
not
occur
to
me
then
but
if
it
had
there
were
the
three
glasses
he
would
not
bring
nor
would
adelaide
nor
as
i
saw
it
would
carmel
chaos
however
one
looked
at
it
chaos
only
one
fact
was
clear
that
carmel
knew
the
whole
story
and
might
communicate
the
same
if
ever
her
brain
cleared
and
she
could
be
brought
to
reveal
the
mysteries
of
that
hour
did
i
desire
such
a
consummation
only
god
who
penetrates
more
deeply
than
ourselves
into
the
hidden
regions
of
the
human
heart
could
tell
i
only
know
that
the
fear
and
expectation
of
such
an
outcome
made
my
anguish
for
the
next
two
weeks
would
she
live
would
she
die
the
question
was
on
every
tongue
the
crisis
of
her
disease
was
approaching
and
the
next
hours
would
decide
her
fate
and
in
consequence
my
own
if
not
her
brother
arthur
as
i
contemplated
the
suspense
of
these
hours
i
revolted
madly
for
the
first
time
against
the
restrictions
of
my
prison
i
wanted
air
movement
the
rush
into
danger
which
my
horse
or
my
automobile
might
afford
anything
which
would
drag
my
thoughts
from
that
sick
room
and
the
anticipated
stir
of
that
lovely
form
into
conscious
life
and
suffering
her
eyes
i
could
see
her
eyes
wakening
upon
the
world
again
after
her
long
wandering
in
the
unknown
and
unimaginable
intricacies
of
ungoverned
thought
and
delirious
suggestion
eyes
of
violet
colour
and
infinite
expression
eyes
which
would
make
a
man
joy
if
they
smiled
on
him
in
innocence
but
which
as
i
well
knew
had
burned
more
than
once
in
her
short
but
strenuous
life
with
fiery
passions
and
might
at
the
instant
of
waking
betray
this
same
unholy
gleam
under
the
curious
gaze
of
the
unsympathetic
ones
set
in
watch
over
her
what
would
her
first
word
be
whither
would
her
first
thought
fly
to
adelaide
or
to
me
to
arthur
or
to
her
own
frightened
and
appalled
self
i
maddened
as
i
dwelt
upon
the
possibilities
of
this
moment
i
envied
arthur
i
envied
the
attendants
i
envied
even
the
servants
in
the
house
they
would
all
know
sooner
than
carmel
carmel
sending
for
clifton
i
begged
him
to
keep
himself
in
communication
with
the
house
or
with
the
authorities
he
promised
to
do
what
he
could
then
perceiving
the
state
i
was
in
he
related
all
he
knew
of
present
conditions
no
one
was
allowed
in
the
sick
room
but
the
nurse
and
the
doctor
even
arthur
was
denied
admission
and
was
wearing
himself
out
in
his
own
room
as
i
was
wearing
myself
out
here
in
restless
inactivity
he
expected
her
to
sink
and
never
to
recover
consciousness
and
was
loud
in
his
expressions
of
rebellion
against
the
men
who
dared
to
keep
him
from
her
bedside
when
her
life
was
trembling
in
the
balance
but
the
nurse
had
hopes
and
so
had
the
doctor
as
for
carmel
looks
they
were
greatly
changed
but
beautiful
still
in
spite
of
the
cruel
scar
left
by
her
fall
against
the
burning
bars
of
her
sister
grate
no
delirium
disturbed
the
rigid
immobility
in
which
she
now
lay
i
could
await
her
awakening
with
quiet
confidence
in
the
justice
of
god
thus
clifton
in
his
ignorance
the
day
was
a
bleak
one
dispiriting
in
itself
even
to
those
who
could
go
about
the
streets
and
lose
themselves
in
their
tasks
and
round
of
duties
to
me
it
was
a
dead
blank
marked
by
such
interruptions
as
necessarily
took
place
under
the
prison
routine
the
evening
hours
which
followed
them
were
no
better
the
hands
on
my
watch
crawled
when
the
door
finally
opened
it
came
as
a
shock
i
seemed
to
be
prepared
for
anything
but
the
termination
of
my
suspense
i
knew
that
it
was
clifton
who
entered
but
i
could
not
meet
his
eye
i
dug
my
nails
into
my
palms
and
waited
for
his
first
word
when
it
came
i
felt
my
spirits
go
down
down
i
had
thought
them
at
their
lowest
ebb
before
he
hesitated
and
i
started
up
tell
me
i
cried
carmel
is
dead
not
dead
said
he
but
silly
her
testimony
is
no
more
to
be
relied
upon
than
that
of
any
other
wandering
mind
xxii
break
in
the
glass
this
inundation
of
mistempered
humour
rests
by
you
only
to
be
qualified
it
was
some
time
before
i
learned
the
particulars
of
this
awakening
it
had
occurred
at
sunset
a
level
beam
of
light
had
shot
across
the
bed
and
the
nurse
had
moved
to
close
the
blind
when
a
low
exclamation
from
the
doctor
drew
her
back
to
mark
the
first
faint
fluttering
of
the
snowy
lids
over
the
eyes
afterwards
she
remembered
what
a
picture
her
youthful
patient
made
with
the
hue
of
renewed
life
creeping
into
her
cheeks
in
faint
reflection
of
the
nest
of
roseate
colour
in
which
she
lay
carmel
hair
was
dark
so
were
her
exquisitely
pencilled
and
the
long
lashes
which
curled
upward
from
her
cheek
in
her
surroundings
of
pink
warm
pink
such
as
lives
in
the
heart
of
the
their
duskiness
took
on
an
added
beauty
and
nothing
not
even
the
long
dark
scar
running
from
eye
to
chin
could
rob
the
face
of
its
individuality
and
suggestion
of
charm
she
was
lovely
but
it
was
the
loveliness
of
line
and
tint
just
as
a
child
is
lovely
soul
and
mind
were
still
asleep
but
momentarily
rousing
as
all
thought
to
conscious
being
and
if
to
conscious
being
then
to
conscious
suffering
as
well
it
was
a
solemn
moment
if
the
man
who
loved
her
had
been
present
or
even
her
brother
who
sullen
as
he
was
must
have
felt
the
tie
of
close
relationship
rise
superior
even
to
his
fears
at
an
instant
so
critical
it
would
have
been
more
solemn
yet
but
with
the
exception
of
the
doctor
and
possibly
the
nurse
only
those
interested
in
her
as
a
witness
in
the
most
perplexing
case
on
the
police
annals
were
grouped
in
silent
watchfulness
about
the
room
waiting
for
the
word
or
look
which
might
cut
the
gordian
knot
which
none
of
them
as
yet
had
been
able
to
untangle
it
came
suddenly
as
all
great
changes
come
one
moment
her
lids
were
down
her
face
calm
her
whole
figure
quiet
in
its
repose
the
next
her
big
violet
eyes
had
flashed
open
upon
the
world
and
lips
and
limbs
were
moving
feebly
but
certainly
in
their
suddenly
recovered
freedom
it
was
then
and
not
at
a
later
moment
when
consciousness
had
fully
regained
its
seat
that
her
face
to
those
who
stood
nearest
wore
the
aspect
of
an
angel
what
she
saw
or
what
vision
remained
to
her
from
the
mysterious
world
of
which
she
had
so
long
been
a
part
none
ever
knew
nor
could
she
perhaps
have
told
but
the
rapture
which
informed
her
features
and
elevated
her
whole
expression
but
poorly
prepared
them
for
the
change
which
followed
her
first
glance
around
on
nurse
and
doctor
the
beam
which
lay
across
the
bed
had
been
no
brighter
than
her
eye
during
that
first
tremulous
instant
of
renewed
life
but
the
clouds
fell
speedily
and
very
human
feelings
peered
from
between
those
lids
as
she
murmured
half
petulantly
why
do
you
look
at
me
so
oh
i
remember
i
remember
and
a
flush
of
which
they
little
thought
her
weakened
heart
capable
spread
over
her
features
hiding
the
scar
and
shaming
her
white
lips
what
the
matter
she
complained
again
as
she
tried
to
raise
her
hands
possibly
to
hide
her
face
i
can
not
move
as
i
used
to
do
and
i
feel
i
feel
you
have
been
ill
came
soothingly
from
the
doctor
you
have
been
in
bed
many
days
now
you
are
better
and
will
soon
be
well
this
is
your
nurse
he
said
nothing
of
the
others
who
were
so
placed
behind
screens
as
to
be
invisible
to
her
she
continued
to
gaze
first
at
one
then
at
the
other
confidently
at
the
doctor
doubtfully
at
the
nurse
as
she
did
so
the
flush
faded
and
gave
way
to
an
anxious
troubled
expression
not
just
the
expression
anticipated
by
those
who
believed
that
with
returning
consciousness
would
come
returning
memory
of
the
mysterious
scene
which
had
taken
place
between
herself
and
sister
or
between
her
sister
and
her
brother
prior
to
adelaide
departure
for
the
whispering
pines
had
they
shared
my
knowledge
had
they
even
so
much
as
dreamed
that
their
patient
had
been
the
companion
of
one
or
both
of
the
others
in
this
tragic
escapade
how
much
greater
would
have
been
their
wonder
at
the
character
of
this
awakening
you
have
the
same
kind
look
for
me
as
always
were
her
next
words
as
her
glance
finally
settled
on
the
doctor
but
hers
bring
me
the
mirror
she
cried
let
me
see
with
my
own
eyes
what
i
have
now
to
expect
from
every
one
who
looks
at
me
i
want
to
know
before
lila
comes
in
why
is
she
here
is
she
with
with
she
was
breaking
down
but
caught
herself
back
with
surprising
courage
and
almost
smiled
i
was
told
then
in
the
shrill
tones
which
will
not
be
denied
she
demanded
again
the
mirror
nurse
unwin
brought
it
her
patient
evidently
remembered
the
fall
she
had
had
in
her
sister
room
and
possibly
the
smart
to
her
cheek
when
it
touched
the
hot
iron
i
see
only
my
forehead
she
complained
as
the
nurse
held
the
mirror
before
her
move
it
a
little
lower
lower
she
commanded
then
suddenly
oh
she
was
still
for
a
long
time
during
which
the
nurse
carried
off
the
glass
i
i
do
like
it
she
acknowledged
quaintly
to
the
doctor
as
he
leaned
over
her
with
compassionate
words
i
shall
have
to
get
acquainted
with
myself
all
over
again
and
so
i
have
been
ill
i
should
have
thought
a
little
burn
like
that
would
make
me
how
adelaide
must
have
worried
adelaide
is
is
not
well
herself
it
distressed
her
to
have
been
out
when
you
fell
do
you
remember
that
she
went
out
that
night
did
she
she
was
right
adelaide
must
have
every
pleasure
she
had
earned
her
good
times
i
must
be
the
one
to
stay
home
now
and
look
after
things
and
learn
to
be
useful
i
do
expect
anything
different
call
adelaide
and
let
me
tell
her
how
how
satisfied
i
am
but
she
she
can
not
come
wait
till
tomorrow
dear
child
rest
is
what
you
need
now
take
these
few
drops
and
go
to
sleep
again
and
not
know
yourself
i
do
know
myself
now
she
repeated
glancing
with
slowly
dilating
eyes
at
the
medicine
glass
he
proffered
i
ca
take
it
she
protested
i
forget
now
why
but
i
ca
take
anything
more
from
a
glass
i
promised
not
to
i
think
take
it
away
it
makes
me
feel
queer
where
is
adelaide
her
memory
was
defective
she
could
not
seem
to
take
in
what
the
doctor
told
her
but
he
tried
her
again
once
more
he
spoke
of
illness
as
the
cause
of
adelaide
absence
her
attention
wandered
while
he
spoke
of
it
how
it
did
hurt
she
cried
but
i
did
think
much
about
it
i
thought
only
of
next
moment
her
voice
rose
in
a
shriek
thin
but
impetuous
and
imbued
with
a
note
of
excited
feeling
which
made
every
person
there
start
there
should
be
she
cried
why
is
there
only
one
this
sounded
like
raving
the
doctor
face
took
on
a
look
of
concern
and
the
nurse
stirred
uneasily
one
is
not
enough
that
is
why
adelaide
is
not
satisfied
why
she
does
not
come
and
love
and
comfort
me
as
i
expected
her
to
tell
her
it
is
not
too
late
yet
not
too
late
yet
not
too
late
the
doctor
hand
was
on
her
forehead
this
not
too
late
whatever
she
meant
by
it
was
indescribably
painful
to
the
listeners
oppressed
as
they
were
by
the
knowledge
that
adelaide
lay
in
her
grave
and
that
all
fancies
all
hopes
all
meditated
actions
between
these
two
were
now
so
far
as
this
world
goes
forever
at
an
end
rest
came
in
carpenter
most
soothing
tones
rest
my
little
carmel
forget
everything
and
rest
he
thought
he
knew
the
significance
of
her
revolt
from
the
glass
he
had
offered
her
she
remembered
the
scene
at
the
cumberland
on
that
fatal
night
and
shrank
from
anything
that
reminded
her
of
it
ordering
the
medicine
put
in
a
cup
he
offered
it
to
her
again
and
she
drank
it
without
question
as
she
quieted
under
its
influence
the
disappointed
listeners
now
carefully
from
the
room
heard
her
murmur
in
final
appeal
can
not
adelaide
spare
one
minute
from
from
her
company
downstairs
to
wish
me
health
and
kiss
me
good
night
was
it
weakness
or
a
settled
inability
to
remember
anything
but
that
which
filled
her
own
mind
it
proved
to
be
a
settled
inability
to
take
in
any
new
ideas
or
even
to
remember
much
beyond
the
completion
of
that
dinner
as
the
days
passed
and
news
of
her
condition
came
to
me
from
time
to
time
i
found
that
she
had
not
only
forgotten
what
had
passed
between
herself
and
the
rest
of
the
family
previous
to
their
departure
for
the
but
all
that
had
afterwards
occurred
at
the
whispering
pines
even
to
her
own
presence
there
and
the
ride
home
she
could
not
even
retain
in
her
mind
for
any
appreciable
length
of
time
the
idea
of
adelaide
death
even
after
carpenter
with
infinite
precautions
revealed
to
her
the
truth
not
that
adelaide
had
been
murdered
but
that
adelaide
had
passed
away
during
the
period
of
her
own
illness
carmel
gave
but
one
cry
of
grief
then
immediately
burst
forth
in
her
old
complaint
that
adelaide
neglected
her
she
had
lost
her
happiness
and
hope
and
adelaide
would
not
spare
her
an
hour
this
expression
when
i
heard
of
it
convinced
me
as
i
believe
it
did
some
others
that
her
act
of
in
not
humouring
my
whim
and
flying
from
home
and
duty
that
night
had
made
a
stronger
impression
on
her
mind
than
all
that
came
after
she
never
asked
for
arthur
this
may
have
grieved
him
but
according
to
my
faithful
friend
and
attorney
it
appeared
to
have
the
contrary
effect
and
to
bring
him
positive
relief
when
it
was
borne
in
on
him
as
it
was
soon
to
be
borne
in
on
all
that
her
mind
was
not
what
it
was
and
that
the
beautiful
carmel
had
lost
something
besides
her
physical
perfection
in
the
awful
calamity
which
had
made
shipwreck
of
the
whole
family
he
grew
noticeably
more
cheerful
and
less
suspicious
in
his
manner
was
it
because
the
impending
inquiry
must
go
on
without
her
and
proceedings
which
had
halted
till
now
be
pushed
with
all
possible
speed
to
a
finish
so
those
who
watched
him
interpreted
his
changed
mood
with
a
result
not
favourable
to
him
with
this
new
shock
of
carmel
inability
to
explain
her
own
part
in
this
tragedy
and
thus
release
my
testimony
and
make
me
a
man
again
in
my
own
eyes
i
lost
the
sustaining
power
which
had
previously
held
me
up
i
became
apathetic
no
longer
counting
the
hours
and
thankful
when
they
passed
arthur
had
not
been
arrested
but
he
understood
or
allowed
others
to
see
that
he
understood
the
reason
for
the
surveillance
under
which
he
was
now
strictly
kept
and
though
he
showed
less
patience
than
myself
under
the
shameful
suspicion
which
this
betokened
he
did
not
break
out
into
open
conflict
with
the
authorities
nor
did
he
protest
his
innocence
or
take
any
other
stand
than
the
one
he
had
assumed
from
the
first
all
this
gave
me
much
food
for
thought
but
i
declined
to
think
i
had
made
up
my
mind
from
the
moment
i
realised
carmel
condition
that
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
till
after
the
inquest
the
public
investigation
which
this
would
involve
would
show
the
trend
of
popular
opinion
and
thus
enlighten
me
as
to
my
duty
meanwhile
i
would
keep
to
the
old
lines
and
do
the
best
i
could
for
myself
without
revealing
the
fact
of
near
interest
in
a
matter
she
was
in
no
better
condition
to
discuss
now
than
when
in
a
state
of
complete
unconsciousness
of
that
inquest
which
was
held
in
due
course
i
shall
not
say
much
only
one
new
fact
was
elicited
by
its
means
and
that
of
interest
solely
as
making
clear
how
there
came
to
be
evidences
of
poison
in
stomach
without
the
quantity
being
great
enough
for
more
than
a
temporary
disturbance
maggie
the
second
girl
had
something
to
say
about
this
when
the
phial
which
had
held
the
poison
was
handed
about
for
inspection
she
had
handled
that
phial
many
times
on
the
shelf
where
it
was
kept
once
she
had
dropped
it
and
the
cork
coming
out
some
of
the
contents
had
escaped
frightened
at
the
mishap
she
had
filled
the
phial
up
with
water
and
put
it
thus
diluted
back
on
the
shelf
no
one
had
noticed
the
difference
and
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
matter
until
now
from
her
description
there
must
have
been
very
little
of
the
dangerous
drug
left
in
the
phial
and
the
conclusions
of
perry
autopsy
received
a
confirmation
which
ended
after
a
mass
of
testimony
tending
rather
to
confuse
than
enlighten
the
jury
in
the
verdict
death
by
strangulation
at
the
hands
of
some
person
unknown
i
had
expected
this
the
evidence
pointing
as
it
did
in
two
opposing
directions
presented
a
problem
which
a
coroner
jury
could
hardly
be
expected
to
solve
what
followed
showed
that
not
only
they
but
the
police
authorities
as
well
acknowledged
the
dilemma
i
was
allowed
one
sweet
half
hour
of
freedom
then
i
was
detained
to
await
the
action
of
the
grand
jury
and
so
was
arthur
when
i
was
informed
of
this
latter
fact
i
made
a
solemn
vow
to
myself
it
was
this
if
it
falls
to
my
lot
to
be
indicted
for
this
murderous
offence
i
will
continue
to
keep
my
own
counsel
as
i
have
already
done
in
face
of
lesser
provocation
and
at
less
dangerous
risk
but
if
i
escape
and
a
true
bill
should
be
found
against
arthur
then
will
i
follow
my
better
instinct
and
reveal
what
i
have
hitherto
kept
concealed
even
if
the
torment
of
the
betrayal
drive
me
to
afterwards
for
i
no
longer
cherished
the
smallest
doubt
that
to
carmel
sudden
rage
and
to
that
alone
the
death
of
adelaide
was
due
my
reason
for
this
change
from
troubled
to
absolute
conviction
can
be
easily
explained
it
dated
from
the
inquest
and
will
best
appear
in
the
relation
of
an
interview
i
held
with
my
attorney
charles
clifton
very
soon
after
my
second
incarceration
we
had
discussed
the
situation
till
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
left
to
discuss
i
understood
him
and
he
thought
he
understood
me
he
believed
arthur
guilty
and
credited
me
with
the
same
convictions
thus
only
could
he
explain
my
inconceivable
reticence
on
certain
points
he
was
very
well
assured
i
could
make
clear
if
i
would
that
he
was
not
the
only
man
who
had
drawn
these
same
conclusions
from
my
attitude
both
before
and
during
the
inquest
troubled
me
greatly
and
deeply
disturbed
my
conscience
but
i
could
indulge
in
no
protests
or
rather
would
indulge
in
no
protests
as
yet
there
was
an
unsolved
doubt
connected
with
some
facts
which
had
come
out
at
the
inquest
or
perhaps
i
should
call
it
a
circumstance
not
as
yet
fully
explained
which
disturbed
me
more
than
did
my
conscience
and
upon
this
circumstance
i
must
have
light
before
i
let
my
counsel
leave
me
i
introduced
the
topic
thus
you
remember
the
detached
sentences
taken
down
by
the
nurse
during
the
period
of
carmel
unconsciousness
they
were
regarded
as
senseless
ravings
and
such
they
doubtless
were
but
there
was
one
of
them
which
attracted
my
attention
and
of
which
i
should
like
an
explanation
i
wish
i
had
that
woman
little
book
here
i
should
like
to
read
for
myself
those
wandering
utterances
you
can
was
the
unexpected
and
welcome
reply
i
took
them
all
down
in
shorthand
as
they
fell
from
perry
lips
i
have
not
had
time
since
to
transcribe
them
but
i
can
read
some
of
them
to
you
if
you
will
give
me
an
idea
as
to
which
ones
you
want
read
the
first
what
she
said
on
the
day
of
the
funeral
i
do
not
think
the
rest
matter
very
much
clifton
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
after
only
a
short
delay
read
out
these
words
the
her
sister
name
uttered
many
times
and
with
greatly
varied
expression
now
in
reproach
now
in
terror
now
in
what
seemed
to
me
in
tones
of
wild
pleading
and
even
despair
this
continued
at
intervals
all
through
the
day
at
three
just
as
people
were
gathering
for
the
funeral
the
quick
glad
cry
smell
flowers
sweet
sweet
flowers
alas
she
did
at
as
the
services
neared
their
close
a
violent
change
took
place
in
her
appearance
and
she
uttered
in
shrill
tones
those
astonishing
words
which
horrified
all
below
and
made
us
feel
that
she
had
a
clairvoyant
knowledge
of
the
closing
of
the
casket
then
taking
place
it
open
break
it
open
and
see
if
her
heart
is
there
pause
there
i
said
that
is
what
i
mean
it
was
not
the
only
time
she
uttered
that
cry
if
you
will
glance
further
down
you
will
come
across
a
second
exclamation
of
the
like
character
yes
here
it
is
it
was
while
the
ubiquitous
sweetwater
was
mousing
about
the
room
read
the
very
words
he
heard
i
have
a
reason
clifton
humour
me
for
this
once
certainly
no
trouble
she
cried
this
time
it
open
break
the
glass
and
look
in
her
heart
should
be
there
her
heart
her
heart
horrible
but
you
insisted
ranelagh
i
thought
i
heard
that
word
glass
i
muttered
more
to
myself
than
to
him
then
with
a
choking
fear
of
giving
away
my
thought
but
unable
to
resist
the
opportunity
of
settling
my
own
fears
i
asked
was
there
glass
in
the
casket
lid
no
there
never
is
but
she
may
have
thought
there
was
i
suggested
hastily
i
much
obliged
to
you
clifton
i
had
to
hear
those
sentences
again
morbidness
no
doubt
the
experience
of
the
last
three
weeks
would
affect
a
man
than
myself
then
before
he
could
reply
what
do
you
think
the
nurse
meant
by
a
violent
change
in
her
patient
why
she
roused
up
i
suppose
moved
or
made
some
wild
or
feverish
gesture
that
is
what
i
should
like
to
know
i
may
seem
foolish
and
unnecessarily
exacting
about
trifles
but
i
would
give
a
great
deal
to
learn
precisely
where
she
looked
and
what
she
did
at
the
moment
she
uttered
those
wild
words
is
the
detective
sweetwater
still
in
town
i
believe
so
came
up
for
the
inquest
but
goes
back
see
him
clifton
ask
him
to
relate
this
scene
he
was
present
you
know
get
him
to
talk
about
it
you
can
and
without
rousing
his
suspicion
keen
as
they
all
say
he
is
and
when
he
talks
listen
and
remember
what
he
says
but
do
ask
questions
do
this
for
me
clifton
some
day
i
may
be
able
to
explain
my
request
but
not
now
i
at
your
service
he
replied
but
he
looked
hurt
at
being
thus
set
to
work
in
the
dark
and
i
dared
say
nothing
to
ease
the
situation
i
did
not
dare
even
to
prolong
the
conversation
on
this
subject
or
on
any
other
subject
in
consequence
he
departed
speedily
and
i
spent
the
afternoon
wondering
whether
he
would
return
before
the
day
ended
or
leave
me
to
the
endurance
of
a
night
of
suspense
i
was
spared
this
final
distress
he
came
in
again
towards
evening
and
this
was
what
he
told
me
i
have
seen
sweetwater
and
was
more
fortunate
in
my
interview
than
i
expected
he
talked
freely
and
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
described
the
very
occurrence
in
which
you
are
so
interested
carmel
had
been
lying
quietly
previous
to
this
outbreak
but
suddenly
started
into
feverish
life
and
raising
herself
up
in
her
bed
pointed
straight
before
her
and
uttered
the
words
we
have
so
often
repeated
that
all
there
was
to
it
and
i
do
see
for
my
part
what
you
have
gained
by
a
repetition
of
the
same
or
why
you
lay
so
much
stress
upon
her
gesture
what
she
said
was
the
thing
though
even
that
is
immaterial
from
a
legal
point
of
view
which
is
the
only
view
of
any
importance
to
you
or
to
me
at
this
juncture
you
a
true
friend
to
me
i
answered
and
never
more
so
than
in
this
instance
forgive
me
that
i
can
not
show
my
appreciation
of
your
goodness
or
thank
you
properly
for
your
performance
of
an
uncongenial
task
i
am
sunk
deep
in
trouble
i
not
myself
and
can
not
be
till
i
know
what
action
will
be
taken
by
the
grand
jury
if
he
replied
i
have
no
remembrance
of
it
neither
do
i
recall
his
but
i
was
presently
aware
that
i
was
alone
and
could
think
out
my
hideous
thought
undisturbed
carmel
had
pointed
straight
before
her
shouting
out
break
in
the
glass
i
knew
her
room
i
had
been
taken
in
there
once
by
adelaide
as
a
sequence
to
a
long
conversation
about
carmel
shortly
after
her
first
return
from
school
adelaide
wished
to
show
me
the
cabinet
in
the
wall
the
cabinet
at
which
carmel
undoubtedly
pointed
if
her
bed
stood
as
it
had
stood
then
it
was
not
quite
full
at
that
time
it
did
not
contain
adelaide
heart
among
the
other
broken
toys
which
carmel
had
destroyed
with
her
own
hand
or
foot
in
her
moments
of
frenzied
passion
the
canary
that
would
not
pick
from
her
hand
the
hat
she
hated
the
bowl
which
held
only
bread
and
milk
when
she
wanted
meat
or
cake
adelaide
had
kept
them
all
locked
behind
glass
and
in
full
view
of
the
eyes
night
and
day
that
the
shame
of
those
past
destructive
moments
might
guard
her
from
their
repetition
and
help
her
to
understand
her
temper
and
herself
i
had
always
thought
it
cruel
of
adelaide
one
of
the
evidences
of
the
streak
which
ran
through
her
otherwise
generous
and
upright
nature
but
its
awful
prophecy
was
what
affected
me
most
now
for
destruction
had
fallen
on
something
more
tender
than
aught
that
cabinet
held
adelaide
heart
and
carmel
acknowledged
it
acknowledged
that
it
should
be
there
with
what
else
she
had
trampled
upon
and
crushed
in
her
white
heat
of
rage
i
could
not
doubt
her
guilt
after
this
whatever
peace
her
forgetfulness
had
brought
whatever
innocent
longing
after
adelaide
the
wild
cry
of
those
first
few
hours
ere
yet
the
impressions
of
her
awful
experience
had
succumbed
to
disease
revealed
her
secret
and
showed
the
workings
of
her
conscience
it
had
not
been
understood
it
had
passed
as
an
awesome
episode
but
for
me
since
hearing
of
it
she
stood
evermore
convicted
out
of
her
own
mouth
that
lovely
mouth
which
angels
might
kiss
in
her
hours
of
joyous
serenity
but
from
whose
caress
friends
would
fly
when
the
passion
reigned
in
her
heart
and
she
must
break
crush
kill
or
go
mad
xxiii
at
ten
instead
of
twelve
forget
the
world
around
you
meantime
friendship
shall
keep
strict
vigils
for
you
anxious
active
only
be
manageable
when
that
friendship
points
you
the
road
to
full
accomplishment
i
do
care
a
rush
what
you
do
to
me
if
you
are
so
besotted
by
your
prejudices
that
you
refuse
to
see
the
nose
before
your
face
if
you
believe
your
own
officer
who
swore
he
saw
ranelagh
hands
upon
my
sister
throat
then
this
world
is
all
a
jumble
and
it
makes
very
little
difference
to
me
whether
i
alive
or
dead
when
these
words
of
arthur
cumberland
were
repeated
to
me
i
echoed
them
in
my
inmost
soul
i
too
cared
very
little
whether
i
lived
or
died
the
grand
jury
reeled
off
its
cases
and
finally
took
up
ours
to
the
last
i
hoped
sincerely
i
think
that
i
should
be
the
man
to
suffer
indictment
but
i
hoped
in
vain
a
true
bill
was
brought
against
arthur
and
his
trial
was
set
for
the
eighteenth
of
january
the
first
use
i
made
of
my
liberty
was
to
visit
adelaide
grave
in
that
sacred
place
i
could
best
review
my
past
and
gather
strength
for
the
future
the
future
was
it
under
my
control
did
arthur
fate
hang
upon
my
word
i
believed
so
but
had
i
strength
to
speak
that
word
i
had
expected
to
i
had
seen
my
duty
clearly
enough
before
the
sitting
of
the
grand
jury
but
now
that
arthur
was
indicted
now
that
it
was
an
accepted
fact
that
he
would
have
to
stand
trial
instead
of
myself
i
was
conscious
of
such
a
recoil
from
my
contemplated
action
that
i
lost
all
confidence
in
myself
and
my
stoical
adherence
to
what
i
considered
the
claims
of
justice
standing
in
the
cemetery
grounds
with
my
eyes
upon
the
mound
beneath
which
lay
the
doubly
injured
adelaide
i
had
it
out
with
myself
for
good
and
all
i
trusted
arthur
i
distrusted
carmel
but
she
had
claims
to
consideration
which
he
lacked
she
was
a
woman
her
fall
would
mean
infinitely
more
to
her
than
any
disgrace
to
him
even
he
had
seemed
to
recognise
this
miserable
and
as
his
life
had
been
he
had
shown
himself
man
enough
not
to
implicate
his
young
sister
in
the
crime
laid
to
his
charge
what
then
was
i
that
i
should
presume
to
disregard
his
lead
in
the
difficult
maze
in
which
we
were
both
lost
yet
because
of
the
he
manifested
he
had
my
sympathy
and
when
i
left
the
cemetery
and
took
my
mournful
way
back
into
town
it
was
with
the
secret
resolution
to
stand
his
friend
if
i
saw
the
case
really
going
against
him
till
then
i
would
consider
the
helpless
girl
by
her
condition
and
injured
enough
already
by
my
misplaced
love
and
its
direful
consequences
the
only
change
i
now
allowed
myself
was
an
occasional
midnight
stroll
up
huested
street
this
was
as
near
as
i
dared
approach
carmel
windows
i
feared
some
watchful
police
spy
perhaps
i
feared
my
own
longings
fulton
house
and
extensive
grounds
lay
between
this
street
and
the
dismal
walls
beyond
the
huge
sycamore
which
lifted
itself
like
a
beacon
above
the
cumberland
estate
but
i
allowed
myself
the
doubtful
pleasure
of
traversing
this
course
and
this
course
only
and
if
i
obtained
one
glimpse
through
bush
and
tree
of
the
spot
whither
all
my
thoughts
ran
continuously
i
went
home
satisfied
this
was
before
carmel
left
with
her
nurse
for
lakewood
after
that
event
i
turned
my
head
no
more
in
taking
my
midnight
stroll
i
was
not
told
the
day
or
hour
of
her
departure
happily
perhaps
for
us
both
for
i
could
never
have
kept
away
from
the
station
i
should
have
risked
everything
for
one
glimpse
of
her
face
if
only
to
satisfy
my
own
judgment
as
to
whether
she
would
ever
recognise
me
again
or
remember
what
had
occurred
on
that
doleful
night
when
the
light
of
her
intellect
set
in
the
darkness
of
sin
and
trouble
the
police
had
the
same
idea
i
think
for
i
heard
later
that
she
was
deliberately
driven
past
the
whispering
pines
though
the
other
road
was
more
direct
and
less
free
if
anything
from
possible
spectators
they
thought
no
doubt
that
a
sight
of
the
place
might
reawaken
whatever
memories
remained
of
the
last
desperate
scene
preceding
her
brother
and
sister
departure
for
this
spot
they
little
knew
how
cruel
was
the
test
or
what
a
storm
of
realisation
might
have
overwhelmed
her
mind
as
her
eye
fell
on
those
accursed
walls
peering
from
their
bower
of
pines
but
i
did
and
i
never
rested
till
i
learned
how
she
had
borne
herself
in
her
slow
drive
by
the
two
guarded
gateways
merrily
it
seems
and
with
no
sign
of
the
remembrances
i
feared
the
test
if
it
were
meant
for
such
availed
them
nothing
no
more
indeed
than
an
encounter
with
her
on
the
road
or
at
the
station
would
have
availed
me
for
the
veil
she
begged
for
had
shrouded
her
features
completely
and
it
was
only
from
her
manner
that
those
who
accompanied
her
perceived
her
and
delight
in
this
change
one
sentence
and
one
only
reached
my
ears
of
all
she
said
before
she
disappeared
from
town
if
adelaide
were
only
going
too
but
i
suppose
i
shall
meet
her
and
ranelagh
somewhere
before
my
return
she
must
be
very
happy
but
not
so
peaceful
as
i
am
she
will
see
that
when
we
meet
i
can
hardly
wait
for
the
day
words
which
set
me
thinking
but
which
i
was
bound
to
acknowledge
could
be
only
the
idle
maunderings
of
a
diseased
mind
from
which
all
impressions
had
fled
save
those
of
innocence
and
futile
hope
one
incident
more
before
i
enter
upon
the
serious
business
of
the
trial
i
had
no
purpose
in
what
i
did
i
merely
followed
the
impulse
of
the
moment
as
i
had
so
often
done
before
in
my
selfish
and
thoughtless
life
when
i
started
one
night
for
my
walk
at
ten
instead
of
twelve
i
went
the
old
way
and
the
old
longing
recurring
at
the
one
charmed
spot
on
the
road
i
cast
a
quick
look
at
the
towering
sycamore
and
the
desolated
house
beneath
which
short
as
it
was
roused
feelings
which
kept
my
head
lowered
for
the
remainder
of
my
walk
north
and
to
the
very
moment
when
on
my
return
the
same
chimneys
and
overhanging
roofs
came
again
into
view
through
the
wintry
branches
then
habit
lifted
my
head
and
i
paused
to
look
again
when
the
low
sound
of
a
human
voice
suppressed
into
a
moan
or
sob
caused
me
to
glance
about
for
the
woman
or
child
who
had
uttered
this
note
of
sorrow
no
one
was
in
sight
but
as
i
started
to
move
on
i
heard
my
name
uttered
in
choked
tones
from
behind
the
hedge
separating
the
fulton
grounds
from
the
city
sidewalk
i
halted
instantly
a
lamp
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
threw
a
broad
illumination
across
the
walk
where
i
stood
but
the
behind
threw
a
shadow
had
the
voice
issued
from
this
isolated
point
of
darkness
i
went
back
to
see
a
pitiful
figure
was
crouching
there
a
frail
agitated
little
being
whom
i
had
no
sooner
recognised
than
my
manner
instantly
assumed
an
air
of
friendly
interest
called
out
by
her
timid
and
appealing
attitude
ella
fulton
i
exclaimed
you
wish
to
speak
to
me
hush
she
prayed
with
a
frightened
gesture
towards
the
house
no
one
knows
i
am
here
mamma
thinks
me
in
bed
and
papa
who
is
out
may
come
home
any
minute
oh
ranelagh
i
in
such
misery
and
no
one
but
you
can
give
me
any
help
i
have
watched
you
go
by
night
after
night
and
i
have
wanted
to
call
out
and
beg
you
to
come
in
and
see
me
or
let
me
go
and
meet
you
somewhere
and
i
have
not
dared
it
was
so
late
you
have
come
earlier
and
i
have
slipped
out
and
o
elwood
you
think
badly
of
me
it
all
about
arthur
and
i
shall
die
if
some
one
does
not
help
me
and
tell
me
how
i
can
reach
him
with
a
message
as
she
spoke
the
last
words
she
caught
at
the
gatepost
which
was
too
broad
and
ponderous
to
offer
her
any
hold
gravely
i
held
out
my
arm
which
she
took
we
were
old
friends
and
felt
no
necessity
of
standing
on
any
sort
of
ceremony
you
do
wish
to
bother
was
her
sensitive
cry
you
had
rather
not
stop
rather
not
listen
to
my
troubles
had
i
shown
my
feelings
so
plainly
as
that
i
felt
mortified
she
was
a
girl
of
puny
physique
and
nervous
manner
the
last
sort
of
person
you
would
expect
arthur
cumberland
to
admire
or
even
to
have
patience
with
and
the
very
last
sort
who
could
be
expected
to
endure
his
rough
ways
or
find
anything
congenial
to
herself
in
his
dissipated
and
purposeless
life
but
the
freaks
of
youthful
passion
are
endless
and
it
was
evident
that
they
loved
each
other
sincerely
her
tremulous
condition
and
meek
complaint
went
to
my
heart
notwithstanding
my
growing
dread
of
any
conversation
between
us
on
this
but
equally
topic
reassuringly
pressing
her
hand
i
was
startled
to
find
a
small
piece
of
paper
clutched
convulsively
within
it
for
arthur
she
explained
under
her
breath
i
thought
you
might
find
some
way
of
getting
it
to
him
father
and
mother
are
so
prejudiced
they
have
never
liked
him
and
now
they
believe
the
very
worst
they
would
lock
me
up
if
they
knew
i
was
speaking
to
you
about
him
mother
is
very
stern
and
says
that
all
this
nonsense
between
arthur
and
myself
must
stop
that
we
must
never
no
matter
whether
he
is
cleared
or
or
silence
then
a
little
gasp
after
which
she
added
with
an
emphasis
which
bespoke
the
death
of
every
hope
she
is
very
decided
about
it
elwood
i
hardly
blamed
the
mother
i
i
love
arthur
i
do
think
him
guilty
and
i
would
gladly
stand
by
him
if
they
would
let
me
i
want
him
to
know
this
i
want
him
to
get
such
comfort
as
he
can
out
of
my
belief
and
my
desire
to
serve
him
i
want
to
sacrifice
myself
but
i
ca
i
ca
she
moaned
you
do
know
how
mother
frightens
me
when
she
looks
at
me
the
words
falter
on
my
tongue
and
i
feel
as
if
it
would
be
easier
to
die
than
to
acknowledge
what
is
in
my
heart
i
could
believe
her
fulton
was
a
notable
woman
whom
many
men
shrank
from
encountering
needlessly
it
was
not
her
tongue
though
that
could
be
bitter
enough
but
a
certain
way
she
had
of
infusing
her
displeasure
into
attitude
tone
and
manner
which
insensibly
sapped
your
and
forced
you
to
accept
her
bad
opinion
of
you
as
your
rightful
due
this
whether
your
judgment
coincided
with
hers
or
not
yet
your
mother
is
your
very
best
friend
i
ventured
gently
with
a
realisation
of
my
responsibility
which
did
not
add
much
to
my
she
seemed
startled
not
in
this
not
in
this
she
objected
with
a
renewal
of
her
anxious
glances
this
time
up
and
down
the
street
i
must
get
a
word
to
arthur
i
i
saw
that
she
had
some
deeper
reason
than
appeared
for
desiring
communication
with
him
i
was
debating
how
best
to
meet
the
situation
and
set
her
right
as
to
my
ability
to
serve
her
without
breaking
down
her
spirit
too
seriously
when
i
felt
her
feverish
hand
pressing
her
little
note
into
my
unwilling
palm
do
read
it
she
whispered
innocent
of
all
offence
and
only
anxious
to
secure
my
good
offices
it
for
arthur
i
used
the
thinnest
paper
so
that
you
can
secrete
it
in
something
he
will
be
sure
to
get
do
disappoint
me
i
was
sorry
for
you
too
and
glad
when
they
let
you
out
both
of
you
are
old
playmates
of
mine
but
arthur
i
had
to
tell
her
i
had
to
dash
her
small
hopes
to
the
ground
forgive
me
ella
i
said
but
i
can
not
carry
him
this
message
or
even
get
it
to
him
secretly
i
am
watched
myself
i
know
it
though
i
have
never
really
detected
the
man
doing
it
oh
she
ejaculated
at
once
is
there
any
one
here
behind
these
trees
or
in
the
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
i
hastened
to
reassure
her
no
no
if
i
been
followed
it
was
not
so
near
as
that
i
can
not
do
what
you
ask
for
several
reasons
arthur
will
credit
you
with
the
best
of
impulses
without
your
incurring
any
such
risk
yes
yes
but
that
not
enough
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
i
strove
to
help
her
there
is
a
man
said
i
who
sees
him
constantly
and
may
be
induced
to
assure
arthur
of
your
belief
and
continued
interest
in
him
that
man
is
his
lawyer
moffat
any
one
will
tell
you
how
to
reach
him
no
no
she
disclaimed
hurriedly
breathlessly
my
last
hope
was
in
you
you
would
think
the
worse
of
me
for
for
what
i
done
or
let
mother
know
i
could
tell
a
stranger
even
if
he
went
right
to
arthur
with
it
i
not
made
that
way
i
could
stand
the
shame
drawing
back
a
step
she
wrung
her
small
hands
together
exclaiming
what
an
unhappy
girl
i
am
then
stepping
up
to
my
side
she
whispered
in
my
ear
there
is
something
i
could
say
which
might
i
stopped
her
right
or
wrong
i
stopped
her
i
had
the
courage
just
then
to
face
the
possibilities
of
what
lay
at
the
end
of
this
simple
sentence
she
possessed
evidence
or
thought
she
did
which
might
help
to
clear
arthur
evidence
of
what
evidence
which
would
implicate
carmel
the
very
thought
unnerved
me
i
had
rather
not
be
the
recipient
of
this
confidence
if
it
is
at
all
important
or
at
all
in
the
line
of
testimony
remember
the
man
i
mentioned
he
will
be
glad
to
hear
of
anything
helpful
to
his
client
her
distress
mounted
to
passion
it
it
something
that
will
destroy
my
mother
confidence
in
me
i
disobeyed
her
i
did
what
she
would
never
have
let
me
do
if
she
had
known
i
i
used
to
meet
arthur
in
the
driveway
back
by
the
barns
i
had
a
key
made
to
the
little
side
door
so
that
i
could
do
it
i
used
to
meet
him
late
i
would
get
up
out
of
bed
when
mother
was
asleep
and
dress
myself
and
sit
at
the
window
until
i
heard
him
come
up
the
street
then
i
would
steal
down
and
catch
him
on
his
way
to
the
stables
i
i
had
a
good
reason
for
this
elwood
he
knew
i
would
be
there
and
it
brought
him
home
earlier
and
not
quite
so
so
full
of
liquor
if
he
was
very
bad
he
would
come
up
the
other
way
and
i
would
sit
waiting
and
crying
till
three
struck
then
creep
into
my
bed
and
try
to
sleep
nights
and
nights
i
have
done
this
nothing
else
in
life
seemed
so
important
for
it
did
hold
him
back
a
little
but
not
so
much
as
if
he
had
loved
me
more
he
loved
me
some
but
he
could
have
loved
me
very
much
or
he
would
have
sent
me
some
word
or
seen
me
if
but
for
a
minute
since
death
and
he
has
he
has
and
that
makes
it
harder
for
me
to
acknowledge
the
watch
i
kept
on
him
and
how
i
know
he
never
went
through
our
grounds
for
the
second
time
that
night
he
went
once
about
nine
but
not
later
i
am
certain
of
this
for
i
was
looking
out
for
him
till
three
in
the
morning
if
he
came
back
and
then
returned
afterwards
to
town
it
was
through
his
own
street
and
that
takes
so
long
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
get
to
the
place
they
said
he
did
at
the
time
they
have
agreed
upon
oh
i
have
studied
every
word
of
the
case
to
see
if
what
i
had
to
tell
would
help
him
any
father
can
not
bear
to
see
me
with
a
newspaper
in
my
hand
and
mother
comes
and
takes
them
out
of
my
room
but
i
have
managed
to
read
every
word
since
they
accused
him
of
being
at
the
that
night
and
i
know
that
he
needs
some
one
to
come
out
boldly
in
his
cause
and
i
want
to
be
that
some
one
and
i
will
be
too
whatever
happens
to
me
if
if
i
must
she
faintly
added
i
was
dumb
but
not
from
lack
of
interest
god
knows
or
from
unsympathetic
feeling
for
this
girl
the
significance
of
the
situation
was
what
held
me
speechless
here
was
help
for
arthur
without
my
braving
all
the
horrors
of
carmel
downfall
by
any
impulsive
act
of
my
own
for
a
moment
hope
in
one
burning
and
renewing
flame
soared
high
in
my
breast
i
was
willing
to
accept
my
release
in
this
way
i
was
willing
to
shift
the
load
from
my
own
back
to
the
delicate
shoulders
of
this
shrinking
but
ardent
girl
then
reason
returned
if
consideration
halted
and
i
asked
myself
but
is
the
help
she
offers
of
any
practical
worth
would
her
timid
declarations
trembling
as
she
was
between
her
awe
of
her
parents
and
her
desire
to
serve
the
man
she
loved
weigh
in
the
balance
against
the
evidence
accumulated
by
the
district
attorney
it
seemed
doubtful
she
would
not
be
believed
and
i
should
have
to
back
up
her
statement
with
my
own
hitherto
suppressed
testimony
it
was
a
hard
case
any
way
i
looked
at
it
a
woman
to
be
sacrificed
whichever
course
i
took
contemplating
the
tremulous
figure
drooping
in
the
shadows
before
me
such
native
chivalry
as
remained
to
me
urged
me
to
spare
this
little
friend
of
mine
so
ungifted
by
nature
so
innocent
in
intention
so
sensitive
and
so
shrinking
in
temperament
and
habit
then
carmel
image
rose
before
me
glorious
impassioned
driven
by
the
fierce
onrush
of
some
mighty
inherent
force
into
violent
deeds
undreamed
of
by
most
women
but
when
thus
undriven
gentle
in
manner
elevated
in
thought
refined
as
only
a
few
rare
characters
are
refined
and
my
heart
stood
still
again
with
doubt
and
i
could
not
say
it
is
your
duty
to
save
him
at
all
hazards
brave
your
father
brave
your
mother
brave
public
opinion
and
possibly
the
wrecking
of
your
whole
future
but
tell
the
truth
and
rid
your
days
of
doubt
your
nights
of
remorse
i
could
not
say
this
so
many
things
might
happen
to
save
arthur
to
save
carmel
to
save
the
little
woman
before
me
i
would
trust
that
future
temporise
a
bit
and
give
such
advice
as
would
relieve
us
both
from
immediate
fear
without
compromising
arthur
undoubted
rights
to
justice
meanwhile
ella
fulton
had
become
distracted
by
new
fears
the
sound
of
could
be
heard
on
the
hill
it
might
be
her
father
should
she
try
to
reach
the
house
or
hide
her
small
body
like
a
trapped
animal
on
the
dark
side
of
the
hedge
i
was
conscious
of
her
thoughts
shared
her
uncertainties
notwithstanding
the
struggle
then
going
on
in
my
own
mind
but
i
remained
quiet
and
so
did
she
and
the
sleigh
ultimately
flew
past
us
up
the
road
the
sigh
which
broke
from
her
lips
as
this
terror
subsided
brought
my
disordered
thoughts
to
a
focus
i
must
not
keep
her
longer
something
must
be
said
at
once
as
soon
as
she
looked
my
way
again
i
spoke
ella
this
is
no
easy
problem
you
have
offered
me
you
are
right
in
thinking
that
this
testimony
of
yours
might
be
of
benefit
to
arthur
and
that
you
ought
to
give
it
in
case
of
extremity
but
i
can
not
advise
you
to
obtrude
it
yet
i
understand
what
it
would
cost
you
and
the
sacrifice
you
would
make
is
too
great
for
the
doubtful
good
which
might
follow
neither
must
you
trust
me
to
act
for
you
in
this
matter
my
own
position
is
too
unstable
for
me
to
be
of
assistance
to
any
one
i
can
sympathise
with
you
possibly
as
no
one
else
can
but
i
can
not
reach
arthur
either
by
word
or
by
message
your
father
is
the
man
to
appeal
to
in
case
interference
becomes
necessary
and
you
must
speak
you
have
not
quite
the
same
fear
of
him
that
you
have
of
your
mother
take
him
into
your
confidence
not
now
but
later
when
things
press
and
you
must
have
a
friend
he
a
just
man
you
may
shock
his
fatherly
susceptibilities
you
may
even
lose
some
of
his
regard
but
he
will
do
the
right
thing
by
you
and
arthur
have
confidence
that
this
is
so
and
rest
little
friend
in
the
hope
and
help
it
gives
you
will
you
i
will
try
i
could
only
tell
father
on
my
knees
but
i
will
do
it
if
if
i
must
she
faltered
out
unconsciously
repeating
her
former
phrase
now
i
must
go
you
have
been
good
only
i
asked
too
much
and
with
no
other
farewell
she
left
me
and
disappeared
up
the
walk
i
lingered
till
i
heard
the
faint
click
of
her
key
in
the
door
she
had
secretly
made
her
own
then
i
moved
on
as
i
did
so
i
heard
a
rustle
somewhere
about
me
on
street
or
lawn
i
never
knew
whence
it
came
but
i
felt
assured
that
neither
her
fears
nor
mine
had
been
quite
unfounded
that
a
listener
had
been
posted
somewhere
near
us
and
that
a
part
if
not
all
we
had
said
had
been
overheard
i
was
furious
for
an
instant
then
the
soothing
thought
came
that
possibly
providence
had
ordained
that
the
gordian
knot
should
be
cut
in
just
this
way
but
the
event
bore
no
ostensible
fruit
the
week
ended
and
the
case
of
the
people
arthur
cumberland
was
moved
for
trial
xxiv
all
this
stood
it
fit
this
royal
session
do
proceed
and
that
without
delay
their
arguments
be
now
produc
and
heard
henry
there
was
difficulty
as
you
will
conceive
in
selecting
an
unprejudiced
jury
but
this
once
having
been
accomplished
the
case
went
quickly
and
smoothly
on
under
the
able
guidance
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
i
shall
spare
you
the
opening
details
also
much
of
the
preliminary
testimony
enough
that
at
the
close
of
the
sixth
day
the
outlook
was
a
serious
one
for
arthur
cumberland
the
prosecution
appeared
to
be
making
good
its
claims
the
quiet
and
unexpectedly
dignified
way
in
which
at
the
beginning
the
defendant
had
faced
the
whole
antagonistic
with
the
simple
plea
of
not
guilty
was
being
slowly
but
surely
forgotten
in
the
accumulated
proofs
of
his
discontented
life
under
his
sister
dominating
influence
his
desire
for
independence
and
a
free
use
of
the
money
held
in
trust
for
him
by
this
sister
under
their
father
will
the
quarrels
which
such
a
situation
would
naturally
evoke
between
characters
cast
in
such
different
moulds
and
actuated
by
such
opposing
tastes
and
principles
and
the
final
culmination
of
the
same
at
the
when
adelaide
forced
him
as
it
were
to
subscribe
to
her
prohibition
of
all
further
use
of
liquor
in
their
house
following
this
evidence
of
motive
came
the
still
more
damaging
one
of
opportunity
he
was
shown
to
have
been
in
the
at
or
near
the
time
of
adelaide
death
the
matter
of
the
bottles
was
gone
into
and
the
event
in
cuthbert
road
then
i
was
called
to
the
stand
and
my
testimony
asked
for
i
had
prepared
myself
for
the
ordeal
and
faced
it
unflinchingly
that
i
might
keep
intact
the
one
point
necessary
to
carmel
safety
i
met
my
inquisitors
now
as
before
with
the
utmost
candour
in
all
other
respects
indeed
in
one
particular
i
was
even
more
exact
in
my
details
than
at
any
previous
examination
anxious
to
explain
my
agitated
and
hesitating
advance
through
the
prior
to
my
discovery
of
the
crime
which
had
been
committed
there
i
acknowledged
what
i
had
hitherto
concealed
that
in
my
first
entrance
into
the
building
i
had
come
upon
a
man
derby
hat
and
coat
hanging
in
the
lower
hall
and
when
questioned
more
minutely
on
the
subject
allowed
it
to
appear
that
it
was
owing
to
the
disappearance
of
these
articles
during
my
stay
upstairs
that
i
had
been
led
into
saying
that
some
one
had
driven
away
from
the
whispering
pines
before
the
coming
of
the
police
this
as
you
will
see
was
in
open
contradiction
of
my
former
statements
that
i
had
an
unknown
party
thus
attired
driving
away
through
the
upper
gateway
just
as
i
entered
by
the
lower
but
it
was
a
contradiction
which
while
noted
by
moffat
failed
to
injure
me
with
the
jury
and
much
less
with
the
spectators
the
impression
had
become
so
firmly
fixed
in
the
public
mind
and
in
that
of
certain
officials
as
well
that
my
early
hesitations
and
misstatements
were
owing
to
a
brotherly
anxiety
to
distract
attention
from
arthur
whose
clothing
they
believed
me
to
have
recognised
in
these
articles
i
have
mentioned
that
i
rather
gained
than
lost
by
what
under
other
circumstances
would
have
seriously
damaged
my
testimony
that
i
should
prevaricate
even
to
my
own
detriment
at
a
preliminary
examination
only
to
tell
the
truth
openly
and
like
a
man
when
in
court
and
under
the
sanctity
of
an
oath
was
in
the
popular
estimation
something
to
my
credit
and
moffat
whose
chief
recommendation
as
counsel
lay
in
his
quick
appreciation
of
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
did
not
press
me
too
sharply
on
this
point
when
he
came
to
his
but
in
other
respects
he
drove
me
hard
an
effort
was
made
by
him
first
of
all
to
discredit
me
as
a
witness
my
lack
of
appreciation
for
adelaide
and
my
secret
but
absorbing
love
for
carmel
were
inexorably
brought
out
also
the
easy
tenor
of
my
life
and
my
dogged
persistence
in
any
course
i
thought
consistent
with
my
happiness
my
character
was
well
known
in
this
town
of
my
birth
and
it
would
have
been
folly
for
me
to
attempt
to
gloss
it
over
i
had
not
even
the
desire
to
do
so
if
my
sins
exacted
penance
i
would
pay
it
here
and
now
and
to
the
full
only
carmel
should
not
suffer
i
refused
to
admit
that
she
had
given
any
evidences
of
returning
my
reckless
passion
my
tongue
would
not
speak
the
necessary
words
and
it
was
not
made
to
it
was
not
her
character
but
mine
which
moffat
was
endeavouring
to
assail
but
though
i
was
thus
shown
up
for
what
i
was
in
a
manner
most
public
and
undesirable
neither
the
rulings
of
the
court
nor
the
attitude
of
the
jury
betrayed
any
loss
of
confidence
in
me
as
a
credible
witness
and
seeing
this
the
wily
lawyer
shifted
his
ground
and
confined
himself
to
an
endeavour
to
shake
me
on
certain
definite
and
important
points
how
were
the
pillows
heaped
upon
the
couch
what
ones
at
top
what
ones
at
bottom
which
did
i
remove
first
and
why
did
i
remove
any
of
them
what
had
i
expected
to
find
these
questions
answered
the
still
ones
followed
of
just
how
my
betrothed
looked
at
the
moment
i
uncovered
her
face
were
the
marks
very
plain
upon
her
throat
how
plain
and
what
did
i
mean
by
saying
that
i
felt
forced
to
lay
my
thumbs
upon
them
was
that
a
natural
thing
to
do
where
was
the
candle
at
that
moment
how
many
feet
away
a
candle
does
not
give
much
light
at
that
distance
was
i
sure
that
i
saw
those
marks
immediately
that
they
were
dark
enough
and
visible
enough
to
draw
my
eyes
from
her
face
which
would
naturally
attract
my
gaze
first
it
was
horrible
devilish
but
i
won
through
only
to
meet
the
still
more
disturbing
question
as
to
whether
i
saw
any
other
evidences
of
strangulation
besides
the
marks
i
could
only
mention
the
appearance
of
the
eyes
and
when
moffat
found
that
he
could
not
shake
me
on
this
point
he
branched
off
into
a
less
harrowing
topic
and
me
in
regard
to
the
ring
i
had
said
that
it
was
on
her
hand
when
i
bade
to
her
in
her
own
house
and
that
it
was
not
there
when
i
came
upon
her
dead
had
the
fact
made
me
curious
to
examine
her
hand
no
then
i
could
not
tell
whether
the
finger
on
which
she
wore
it
gave
any
evidence
of
this
ring
having
been
pulled
off
with
violence
no
i
could
not
swear
that
in
my
opinion
it
was
i
could
not
the
small
flask
of
cordial
and
the
three
glasses
one
clean
and
the
others
showing
signs
of
having
been
used
were
next
taken
up
but
with
no
result
for
the
defence
i
had
told
all
i
knew
about
these
in
my
direct
examination
also
about
such
matters
as
the
bottles
found
on
the
kitchen
table
the
leaving
of
my
keys
at
the
cumberland
house
and
the
fact
well
known
that
the
two
bottles
of
wine
left
in
the
and
tabulated
by
the
steward
as
so
left
in
the
list
found
in
my
apartments
were
of
an
exclusive
brand
unlikely
to
be
found
anywhere
else
in
town
i
could
add
nothing
more
and
having
spoken
the
exact
truth
concerning
them
from
the
very
first
i
ran
no
chance
of
contradicting
myself
even
under
the
close
fire
of
the
opposing
counsel
but
there
was
a
matter
i
dreaded
to
see
him
approach
and
which
i
was
equally
sure
with
an
insight
unshared
i
believe
by
any
one
else
in
the
whole
courtroom
was
equally
dreaded
by
the
prisoner
this
was
the
presence
in
the
chimney
of
the
letter
i
had
long
ago
been
compelled
in
my
own
defence
to
acknowledge
having
written
to
the
victim
young
sister
carmel
cumberland
as
i
saw
district
attorney
fox
about
to
enter
upon
this
topic
i
gathered
myself
together
to
meet
the
onslaught
for
in
this
matter
i
could
not
be
strictly
truthful
since
the
least
slip
on
my
part
might
awaken
the
whole
world
to
the
fact
that
it
could
only
have
come
there
through
the
agency
of
carmel
herself
what
moffat
thought
of
it
what
he
hoped
to
prove
in
the
behalf
by
raking
this
subject
over
it
was
left
for
me
to
discover
later
the
prisoner
was
an
innocent
man
in
his
eyes
i
was
not
and
while
the
time
had
not
come
for
him
to
make
this
openly
apparent
he
was
not
above
showing
even
now
that
the
case
contained
a
factor
which
weakened
the
prosecution
a
factor
totally
dissociated
with
the
openly
accepted
theory
that
the
crime
was
simply
the
result
of
personal
cupidity
and
drunken
spite
and
in
this
he
was
right
it
did
weaken
it
weakened
it
to
the
point
of
collapse
if
the
counsel
for
the
defence
had
fully
acted
up
to
his
opportunity
but
something
withheld
him
just
at
the
moment
when
i
feared
the
truth
must
come
out
he
hesitated
and
veered
gradually
away
from
this
subject
in
his
nervous
pacings
to
and
fro
before
the
witness
stand
his
eye
had
rested
for
a
moment
on
arthur
and
with
this
result
the
situation
was
saved
but
at
a
great
loss
to
the
defendant
i
began
to
cherish
softened
feelings
towards
arthur
cumberland
from
this
moment
was
it
then
or
later
that
he
began
in
his
turn
to
cherish
new
and
less
hostile
feelings
towards
myself
he
had
hated
me
and
vowed
my
death
if
i
escaped
the
fate
he
could
now
dimly
see
opening
out
before
himself
yet
i
could
see
that
he
was
glad
to
see
me
slip
from
my
tormentor
hands
with
my
story
unimpeached
and
that
he
drew
his
breath
more
deeply
and
with
much
more
evidence
of
freedom
now
that
my
testimony
had
been
thoroughly
sifted
and
nothing
had
come
to
light
implicating
carmel
i
even
thought
i
caught
a
kindly
gleam
in
his
eye
as
it
met
mine
at
this
critical
juncture
and
by
its
light
i
understood
my
man
and
what
he
hoped
from
me
he
wished
me
at
any
risk
to
himself
to
unite
with
him
in
saving
carmel
good
name
that
i
should
accede
to
this
that
i
should
respect
his
generous
wishes
and
let
him
go
to
unmerited
destruction
for
even
so
imperative
an
obligation
as
we
both
lay
under
was
a
question
for
the
morrow
i
could
not
decide
upon
it
not
while
the
smallest
hope
remained
that
he
would
yet
escape
conviction
by
other
means
than
the
one
which
would
wreck
the
life
we
were
both
intent
on
saving
several
short
examinations
followed
mine
all
telling
in
their
nature
all
calculated
to
fix
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
the
following
facts
pray
pardon
the
repetition
it
is
necessary
to
present
the
case
to
you
just
as
it
stood
at
this
period
of
my
greatest
struggle
that
arthur
swayed
by
cupidity
and
moved
to
rage
by
the
scene
at
the
had
by
some
unknown
means
of
a
more
or
less
violent
character
prevailed
upon
adelaide
to
accompany
him
to
the
whispering
pines
in
the
small
cutter
to
which
in
the
absence
of
every
servant
about
the
place
he
himself
had
harnessed
the
grey
mare
that
in
preparation
for
this
visit
to
a
spot
remote
from
observation
and
closed
against
all
visitors
they
still
for
some
unknown
reason
had
carried
between
them
a
candlestick
and
candle
a
flask
of
cordial
three
glasses
and
a
small
bottle
marked
poison
also
some
papers
letters
or
scraps
of
correspondence
among
them
the
compromising
line
i
had
written
to
carmel
that
while
in
this
building
at
an
hour
not
yet
settled
a
second
altercation
had
arisen
between
them
or
some
attempt
been
made
by
the
brother
which
had
alarmed
adelaide
and
sent
her
flying
to
the
telephone
in
great
agitation
with
an
appeal
to
the
police
for
help
this
telephone
was
in
a
front
room
and
the
jury
was
led
to
judge
that
she
had
gained
access
to
it
while
her
companion
ransacked
the
and
brought
the
six
bottles
of
spirit
up
from
the
cellar
that
her
outcry
had
alarmed
the
prisoner
in
his
turn
causing
him
to
leave
most
of
the
bottles
below
and
hasten
up
to
the
room
where
he
completed
the
deed
with
which
he
had
previously
threatened
her
that
poison
having
failed
he
resorted
to
strangulation
after
which
or
before
came
the
robbery
of
her
ring
the
piling
up
of
the
cushions
over
the
body
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
hide
the
deed
or
to
prolong
the
search
for
the
victim
then
the
departure
the
locking
of
the
front
door
behind
the
perpetrator
the
flight
of
the
grey
horse
and
cutter
through
the
blinding
storm
the
blowing
off
of
the
driver
hat
the
identification
of
the
same
by
means
of
the
left
on
its
brim
by
the
mechanic
wife
the
presence
of
a
portion
of
one
of
the
two
abstracted
bottles
in
the
stable
where
the
horse
was
put
up
and
the
appearance
of
arthur
with
the
other
bottle
at
the
door
of
the
inn
in
cuthbert
road
just
as
the
clock
was
striking
eleven
this
latter
fact
might
have
been
regarded
as
proving
an
alibi
owing
to
the
length
of
road
between
the
cumberland
house
and
the
place
just
mentioned
if
there
had
not
been
a
short
cut
to
town
open
to
him
by
means
of
a
door
in
the
wall
separating
the
cumberland
and
fulton
grounds
a
door
which
was
found
unlocked
and
with
the
key
in
it
by
zadok
brown
the
coachman
when
he
came
home
about
three
next
morning
all
this
stood
not
an
item
of
this
testimony
could
be
shaken
most
of
it
was
true
some
of
it
false
but
what
was
false
so
unassailable
by
any
ordinary
means
that
as
i
have
already
said
the
clouds
seemed
settling
heavily
over
arthur
cumberland
when
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
day
the
proceedings
closed
the
night
that
followed
was
a
heavy
one
for
me
then
came
the
fateful
morrow
and
after
that
the
day
of
days
destined
to
make
a
impression
on
all
who
attended
this
trial
xxv
i
am
innocent
all
is
oblique
there
nothing
level
in
our
cursed
natures
but
direct
villainy
therefore
be
abhorred
all
feasts
societies
and
throngs
of
men
his
semblable
yea
himself
timon
disdains
of
i
was
early
in
my
seat
feeling
the
momentousness
of
the
occasion
for
this
day
must
decide
my
action
for
or
against
the
prisoner
i
searched
the
faces
of
the
jury
of
the
several
counsel
and
of
the
judge
i
was
anxious
to
know
what
i
had
to
expect
from
them
in
case
my
conscience
got
the
better
of
my
devotion
to
carmel
interests
and
led
me
into
that
declaration
of
the
real
facts
which
was
forever
faltering
on
my
tongue
without
having
as
yet
received
the
final
impetus
which
could
only
end
in
speech
to
give
him
his
rightful
precedence
the
judge
showed
an
impenetrable
countenance
but
little
changed
from
that
with
which
he
had
faced
us
all
from
the
start
he
like
most
of
the
men
involved
in
these
proceedings
had
been
a
close
friend
of
the
prisoner
father
and
in
his
capacity
of
judge
in
this
momentous
trial
had
had
to
contend
with
his
personal
predilections
possibly
with
concealed
sympathies
if
not
with
equally
prejudices
this
had
lent
to
his
aspect
a
sternness
never
observable
in
it
before
but
no
man
even
the
captious
moffat
had
seriously
questioned
his
rulings
and
whatever
the
cost
to
himself
he
had
up
to
this
time
held
the
scales
of
justice
so
evenly
that
it
would
have
taken
an
audacious
mind
to
have
ventured
on
an
interpretation
of
his
real
attitude
or
mental
leaning
in
this
case
from
this
imposing
presence
nobly
sustained
by
a
figure
and
a
head
and
face
indicative
of
intellect
and
every
kindly
attribute
i
turned
to
gaze
upon
fox
and
his
colleagues
one
spirit
seemed
to
animate
them
confidence
in
their
case
and
unqualified
satisfaction
at
its
present
status
i
was
conscious
of
a
certain
ironic
impulse
to
smile
as
i
noted
the
eager
whisper
and
the
bustle
of
preparation
with
which
they
settled
upon
their
next
witness
and
prepared
to
open
their
batteries
upon
him
how
easily
i
could
call
down
that
high
look
and
into
what
a
turmoil
i
could
throw
them
all
by
an
ingenuous
demand
to
be
recalled
to
the
stand
but
the
psychological
moment
had
not
yet
come
and
i
subdued
the
momentary
impulse
and
proceeded
with
my
scrutiny
of
the
people
about
me
the
jury
looked
tired
with
the
exception
of
one
especially
alert
little
man
who
drank
in
even
the
most
uninteresting
details
with
avidity
but
they
all
had
good
faces
and
none
could
doubt
their
interest
or
that
they
were
fully
alive
to
the
significance
of
the
occasion
moffat
leading
counsel
for
the
defendant
was
a
spare
man
of
unusual
height
modified
a
little
and
only
a
little
by
the
forward
droop
of
his
shoulders
nervous
in
manner
quick
short
sometimes
rasping
in
speech
he
had
the
changeful
eye
and
mobile
expression
of
a
very
sensitive
nature
and
from
him
if
from
any
one
i
might
hope
to
learn
how
much
or
how
little
arthur
had
to
fear
from
the
day
proceedings
but
moffat
countenance
was
not
as
readable
as
usual
he
looked
preoccupied
a
strange
thing
for
him
and
instead
of
keeping
his
eye
on
the
witness
as
was
his
habitual
practice
he
allowed
it
to
wander
over
the
sea
of
heads
before
him
with
a
curious
expectant
interest
which
aroused
my
own
curiosity
and
led
me
to
hunt
about
for
its
cause
my
first
glance
was
unproductive
i
saw
only
the
usual
public
such
as
had
confronted
us
the
whole
week
with
curious
and
increasing
interest
but
as
i
searched
further
i
discerned
in
an
inconspicuous
corner
the
bowed
head
veiled
almost
beyond
recognition
of
ella
fulton
it
was
her
first
appearance
in
court
each
day
i
had
anticipated
her
presence
and
each
day
i
had
failed
to
see
my
anticipations
realised
but
she
was
here
now
and
so
were
her
father
and
her
cold
and
dominating
mother
and
beholding
her
thus
accompanied
i
fancied
i
understood
poorly
concealed
excitement
but
another
glance
at
fulton
assured
me
that
i
was
mistaken
in
this
hasty
surmise
no
such
serious
purpose
as
i
feared
lay
back
of
their
presence
here
curiosity
alone
explained
it
and
as
i
realised
what
this
meant
and
how
little
understanding
it
betokened
of
the
fierce
struggle
then
going
on
in
the
timid
breast
of
their
distracted
child
a
sickening
sense
of
my
own
responsibility
drove
carmel
beauty
and
carmel
claims
temporarily
from
my
mind
and
following
the
direction
of
ella
thoughts
if
not
her
glances
i
sought
in
the
face
of
the
prisoner
a
recognition
of
her
presence
if
not
of
the
promise
this
presence
brought
him
his
eye
had
just
fallen
on
her
i
was
assured
of
this
by
the
sudden
softening
of
his
expression
the
first
real
softening
i
had
ever
seen
in
it
it
was
but
a
momentary
flash
but
it
was
unmistakable
in
its
character
as
was
his
speedy
return
to
his
former
stolidity
whatever
his
thoughts
were
at
sight
of
his
little
sweetheart
he
meant
to
hide
them
even
from
his
counsel
most
of
all
from
his
counsel
i
decided
after
further
contemplation
of
them
both
if
moffat
still
showed
nervousness
it
was
for
some
other
reason
than
anxiety
about
this
little
body
hiding
from
sight
behind
the
proudly
held
figures
of
father
and
mother
the
opening
testimony
of
the
day
while
not
vital
was
favourable
to
the
prosecution
in
that
it
showed
arthur
conduct
since
the
murder
to
have
been
inconsistent
with
perfect
innocence
his
belated
return
at
noon
the
next
day
raging
against
the
man
who
had
been
found
in
an
incriminating
position
on
the
scene
of
crime
while
at
the
same
time
failing
to
betray
his
own
presence
there
till
driven
to
it
by
accumulating
circumstances
and
the
persistent
inquiries
of
the
police
the
care
he
took
to
avoid
drink
though
constant
tippling
was
habitual
to
him
and
formed
the
great
cause
of
quarrel
between
himself
and
the
murdered
adelaide
his
haunting
of
carmel
door
and
anxious
listening
for
any
words
she
might
let
fall
in
her
delirium
the
suspicion
which
he
constantly
betrayed
of
the
nurse
when
for
any
reason
he
was
led
to
conclude
that
she
had
heard
something
which
he
had
not
his
behaviour
at
the
funeral
and
finally
his
action
in
demanding
to
have
the
removed
that
he
might
look
again
at
the
face
he
had
made
no
effort
to
gaze
upon
when
opportunity
offered
and
time
and
place
were
seemly
these
facts
and
many
more
were
brought
forward
in
grim
array
against
the
prisoner
with
but
little
opposition
from
his
counsel
and
small
betrayal
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
arthur
himself
his
stolid
face
had
remained
stolid
even
when
the
ring
which
had
fallen
out
of
his
sister
casket
was
shown
to
the
jury
and
the
connection
made
between
its
presence
there
and
the
intrusion
of
his
hand
into
the
same
on
the
occasion
above
mentioned
this
once
thoughtless
and
hopelessly
dissipated
boy
had
not
miscalculated
his
nerve
it
was
sufficient
for
an
ordeal
which
might
have
tried
the
courage
and
of
the
most
hardened
criminal
then
came
the
great
event
of
the
day
in
anticipation
of
which
the
had
been
packed
and
every
heart
within
it
awakened
by
slow
degrees
to
a
state
of
great
nervous
expectancy
the
prosecution
rested
and
the
junior
counsel
for
the
defence
opened
his
case
to
the
jury
if
i
had
hoped
for
any
startling
disclosure
calculated
to
establish
his
client
alleged
alibi
or
otherwise
to
free
the
same
from
the
definite
charge
of
murder
i
had
reason
to
be
greatly
disappointed
by
this
maiden
effort
of
a
young
and
inexperienced
lawyer
if
not
exactly
weak
there
was
an
unexpected
vagueness
in
its
statements
which
seemed
quite
out
of
keeping
with
the
emphatic
declaration
which
he
made
of
the
innocence
even
arthur
was
sensible
of
the
bad
effect
made
by
this
preliminary
address
more
than
once
during
its
delivery
and
notably
at
its
conclusion
he
turned
to
moffat
with
a
bitter
remark
which
was
not
without
effect
on
that
gentleman
cheek
and
at
once
called
forth
a
retort
stinging
enough
to
cause
arthur
to
sink
back
into
his
place
with
the
first
sign
of
restlessness
i
had
observed
in
him
moffat
is
sly
moffat
has
something
up
his
sleeve
i
will
wait
till
he
sees
fit
to
show
it
was
my
thought
then
as
i
caught
a
wild
and
pleading
look
from
ella
i
added
in
positive
assertion
to
myself
and
so
must
she
answering
her
unspoken
appeal
with
an
admonitory
shake
of
the
head
i
carelessly
let
my
fingers
rest
upon
my
mouth
until
i
saw
that
she
understood
me
and
was
prepared
to
follow
my
lead
for
a
little
while
longer
my
satisfaction
at
this
was
curtailed
by
the
calling
of
arthur
cumberland
to
the
stand
to
witness
in
his
own
defence
i
had
dreaded
this
contingency
i
saw
that
for
some
reason
both
his
counsel
and
associate
counsel
were
not
without
their
own
misgivings
as
to
the
result
of
their
somewhat
doubtful
experiment
a
change
was
observable
in
this
degenerate
son
of
the
cumberlands
since
many
there
had
confronted
him
face
to
face
physically
he
was
improved
enough
time
had
elapsed
since
his
sudden
dropping
of
old
habits
for
him
to
have
risen
above
its
first
effects
and
to
have
acquired
that
tone
of
personal
dignity
which
follows
a
successful
issue
to
any
moral
conflict
but
otherwise
the
difference
was
such
as
to
arouse
doubt
as
to
the
real
man
lurking
behind
his
dogged
uncommunicative
manner
even
with
the
knowledge
of
his
motives
which
i
believed
myself
to
possess
i
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
his
indifference
to
self
and
the
immobility
of
manner
he
maintained
under
all
circumstances
and
during
every
fluctuation
which
took
place
in
the
presentation
of
his
case
or
in
the
temper
of
the
people
surrounding
him
i
felt
that
beyond
the
one
fact
that
he
could
be
relied
upon
to
protect
carmel
name
and
character
even
to
the
jeopardising
of
his
case
he
was
not
to
be
counted
on
and
might
yet
startle
many
of
us
and
most
notably
of
all
the
little
woman
waiting
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
in
his
own
defence
before
she
threw
herself
into
the
breach
and
made
that
devoted
attempt
to
save
him
in
his
own
despite
which
had
been
my
terror
from
the
first
and
was
my
terror
now
perjury
but
not
in
his
own
defence
rather
in
opposition
to
it
that
is
what
his
counsel
had
to
fear
and
i
wondered
if
they
knew
it
my
attention
became
absorbed
in
the
puzzle
carmel
fate
if
not
ella
and
certainly
my
own
hung
upon
the
issue
this
i
knew
and
this
i
faced
calmly
but
very
surely
as
the
preliminary
questions
having
been
answered
moffat
proceeded
the
witness
name
having
been
demanded
and
given
and
some
other
preliminary
formalities
gone
through
he
was
asked
cumberland
did
you
have
any
quarrel
with
your
sister
during
the
afternoon
or
evening
of
december
the
second
i
did
then
as
if
not
satisfied
with
this
simple
statement
he
blurted
forth
and
it
was
the
first
i
hated
the
discipline
she
imposed
upon
me
and
the
disapproval
she
showed
of
my
ways
and
the
manner
in
which
i
chose
to
spend
my
money
a
straightforward
expression
of
feeling
but
hardly
a
judicious
one
judge
edwards
glanced
in
some
surprise
from
moffat
to
the
daring
man
who
could
choose
thus
to
usher
in
his
defence
and
then
forgetting
his
own
emotions
in
his
instinctive
desire
for
order
rapped
sharply
with
his
gavel
in
correction
of
the
audible
expression
of
a
like
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
expectant
audience
moffat
apparently
unaffected
by
this
result
of
his
daring
move
pursued
his
course
with
the
quiet
determination
of
one
who
sees
his
goal
and
is
working
deliberately
towards
it
do
you
mind
particularising
of
what
did
she
especially
disapprove
in
your
conduct
or
way
of
spending
money
she
disapproved
of
my
fondness
for
drink
she
did
like
my
late
hours
or
the
condition
in
which
i
frequently
came
home
i
did
not
like
her
expressions
of
displeasure
or
the
way
she
frequently
cut
me
short
when
i
wanted
to
have
a
good
time
with
my
friends
we
never
agreed
i
made
her
suffer
often
and
unnecessarily
i
regret
it
now
she
was
a
better
sister
to
me
than
i
could
then
understand
this
was
uttered
slowly
and
with
a
quiet
emphasis
which
reawakened
that
excited
hum
the
judge
had
been
at
such
pains
to
quell
a
moment
before
but
he
did
not
quell
it
now
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
his
duty
in
the
strong
interest
called
up
by
these
admissions
from
the
tongue
of
the
most
imperturbable
prisoner
he
had
had
before
him
in
years
moffat
with
an
eye
on
district
attorney
fox
who
had
shown
his
surprise
at
the
trend
the
examination
was
taking
by
a
slight
indication
of
uneasiness
grateful
enough
no
doubt
to
the
daring
counsellor
went
on
with
his
examination
cumberland
will
you
tell
us
when
you
first
felt
this
change
of
opinion
in
regard
to
your
sister
fox
leaped
to
his
feet
then
he
slowly
reseated
himself
evidently
he
thought
it
best
to
let
the
prisoner
have
his
full
say
possibly
he
may
have
regretted
his
leniency
the
next
moment
when
with
a
solemn
lowering
of
his
head
arthur
answered
when
i
saw
my
home
desolated
in
one
dreadful
night
with
one
sister
dead
in
the
house
the
victim
of
violence
and
another
delirious
from
fright
or
some
other
analogous
cause
i
had
ample
time
to
think
and
i
used
that
time
that
all
simple
words
read
or
repeated
but
in
that
crowded
with
every
ear
strained
to
catch
the
lie
which
seemed
the
only
refuge
for
the
man
so
hemmed
in
by
circumstance
these
words
uttered
without
the
least
attempt
at
effect
fell
with
a
force
which
gave
new
life
to
such
as
wished
to
see
this
man
acquitted
his
counsel
as
if
anxious
to
take
advantage
of
this
very
expectation
to
heighten
the
effect
of
what
followed
proceeded
immediately
to
inquire
when
did
you
see
your
sister
adelaide
for
the
last
time
alive
a
searching
question
what
would
be
his
reply
a
very
quiet
one
that
night
at
the
when
i
left
the
room
i
turned
to
look
at
her
she
was
not
looking
at
me
so
i
slammed
the
door
and
went
upstairs
in
an
hour
or
so
i
had
left
the
house
to
get
a
drink
i
got
the
drink
but
i
never
saw
adelaide
again
till
i
saw
her
in
her
coffin
this
blunt
denial
of
the
crime
for
which
he
stood
there
arraigned
fell
on
my
heart
with
a
weight
which
showed
me
how
inextinguishable
is
the
hope
we
cherish
deep
down
under
all
surface
convictions
i
had
been
unconscious
of
this
hope
but
it
was
there
it
seemed
to
die
a
double
death
at
these
words
for
i
believed
him
courage
is
needed
for
a
lie
there
were
no
signs
visible
in
him
as
yet
of
his
having
drawn
upon
this
last
resource
of
the
despairing
i
should
know
it
when
he
did
he
could
not
hide
the
subtle
change
from
me
to
others
this
declaration
came
with
greater
or
less
force
according
as
it
was
viewed
in
the
light
of
a
dramatic
trick
of
moffat
or
as
the
natural
outburst
of
a
man
fighting
for
his
life
in
his
own
way
and
with
his
own
weapons
i
could
not
catch
the
eye
of
ella
cowering
low
in
her
seat
so
could
not
judge
what
tender
chords
had
been
struck
in
her
sensitive
breast
by
these
two
assertions
so
dramatically
offset
against
each
other
the
one
his
antagonism
to
the
dead
the
other
his
freedom
from
the
crime
in
which
that
antagonism
was
supposed
to
have
culminated
moffat
satisfied
so
far
put
his
next
question
with
equal
directness
cumberland
you
have
mentioned
seeing
your
sister
in
her
coffin
when
was
this
at
the
close
of
her
funeral
just
before
she
was
carried
out
was
that
the
first
and
only
time
you
had
seen
her
so
placed
it
was
had
you
seen
the
casket
itself
prior
to
this
moment
of
which
you
speak
i
had
not
had
you
been
near
it
had
you
handled
it
in
any
way
no
sir
cumberland
you
have
heard
mention
made
of
a
ring
worn
by
your
sister
in
life
but
missing
from
her
finger
after
death
i
have
you
remember
this
ring
i
do
is
this
it
it
is
so
far
as
i
can
judge
at
this
distance
hand
the
ring
to
the
witness
ordered
the
judge
the
ring
was
so
handed
he
glanced
at
it
and
said
bitterly
i
recognise
it
it
was
her
engagement
ring
was
this
ring
on
her
finger
that
night
at
the
i
can
not
say
positively
but
i
believe
so
i
should
have
noticed
its
absence
why
may
i
ask
for
the
first
time
the
prisoner
flushed
and
the
look
he
darted
at
his
counsel
had
the
sting
of
a
reproach
in
it
yet
he
answered
it
was
the
token
of
an
engagement
i
did
believe
in
or
like
i
should
have
hailed
any
proof
that
this
engagement
was
off
moffat
smiled
enigmatically
cumberland
if
you
are
not
sure
of
having
seen
this
ring
then
when
did
you
see
it
and
where
a
rustle
from
end
to
end
of
that
crowded
this
was
an
audacious
move
what
was
coming
what
would
be
the
answer
of
the
man
who
was
believed
not
only
to
have
made
himself
the
possessor
of
this
ring
but
to
have
taken
a
most
strange
and
uncanny
method
of
disposing
of
it
afterward
in
the
breathless
hush
which
followed
this
first
involuntary
expression
of
feeling
arthur
voice
rose
harsh
but
steady
in
this
reply
i
saw
it
when
the
police
showed
it
to
me
and
asked
me
if
i
could
identify
it
was
that
the
only
time
you
have
seen
it
up
to
the
present
moment
instinctively
the
witness
right
hand
rose
it
was
as
if
he
were
mentally
repeating
his
oath
before
he
uttered
coldly
and
with
emphasis
though
without
any
show
of
emotion
it
is
the
universal
silence
gave
way
to
a
universal
sigh
of
excitement
and
relief
district
attorney
fox
lips
curled
with
an
imperceptible
smile
of
disdain
which
might
have
impressed
the
jury
if
they
had
been
looking
his
way
but
they
were
all
looking
with
eager
and
interested
eyes
at
the
prisoner
who
had
just
uttered
this
second
distinct
and
unequivocal
denial
moffat
noted
this
and
his
own
lip
curled
but
with
a
very
different
show
of
feeling
from
that
which
had
animated
his
distinguished
opponent
without
waiting
for
the
present
sentiment
to
cool
he
proceeded
immediately
with
his
examination
you
swear
that
you
have
seen
this
ring
but
once
since
the
night
of
your
sister
death
and
that
was
when
it
was
shown
you
in
the
coroner
office
i
do
does
this
mean
that
it
was
not
in
your
possession
at
any
time
during
that
interim
it
certainly
does
cumberland
more
than
one
witness
has
testified
to
the
fact
of
your
having
been
seen
to
place
your
hand
in
the
casket
of
your
sister
before
the
eyes
of
the
minister
and
of
others
attending
her
funeral
is
this
true
it
is
was
not
this
a
most
unusual
thing
to
do
perhaps
i
was
not
thinking
about
that
i
had
a
duty
to
perform
and
i
performed
it
a
duty
will
you
explain
to
the
jury
what
duty
the
witness
head
rose
then
sank
he
as
well
as
every
one
else
seemed
to
be
impressed
by
the
solemnity
of
the
moment
though
the
intensity
of
my
own
interest
would
not
allow
my
eyes
to
wander
from
his
face
i
could
imagine
the
strained
look
in
ella
as
she
awaited
his
words
they
came
in
another
instant
but
with
less
steadiness
than
he
had
shown
before
i
even
thought
i
could
detect
a
tremor
in
his
muscles
as
well
as
in
his
voice
i
had
rebelled
against
my
sister
wishes
i
had
grieved
and
deceived
her
up
to
the
very
night
of
her
foul
and
unnatural
death
and
all
through
here
his
eye
flashed
and
for
that
fleeting
moment
he
looked
a
man
i
wished
to
take
an
oath
an
oath
i
would
remember
it
was
for
this
purpose
i
ordered
the
casket
opened
and
thrust
my
fingers
through
the
flowers
i
found
there
when
my
fingers
touched
my
sister
brow
i
inwardly
swore
never
to
taste
liquor
again
i
have
kept
that
oath
difficult
as
it
was
in
my
state
of
mind
and
with
all
my
troubles
i
have
kept
it
and
been
misunderstood
in
doing
so
he
added
in
lower
tones
and
with
just
a
touch
of
bitterness
it
was
such
an
unexpected
explanation
and
so
calculated
to
cause
a
decided
and
favourable
reaction
in
the
minds
of
those
who
had
looked
upon
this
especial
act
of
his
as
an
irrefutable
proof
of
guilt
that
it
was
but
natural
that
some
show
of
public
feeling
should
follow
but
this
was
checked
almost
immediately
and
moffat
voice
was
heard
rising
again
in
his
strange
but
telling
examination
when
you
thrust
your
hand
in
to
take
this
oath
did
you
drop
anything
into
your
sister
casket
i
did
not
my
hand
was
empty
i
held
no
ring
and
dropped
none
in
i
simply
touched
her
forehead
this
added
to
the
feeling
and
in
another
instant
the
excitement
might
have
risen
into
hubbub
had
not
the
emotions
of
one
little
woman
found
vent
in
a
low
and
sobbing
cry
which
relieved
the
tension
and
gave
just
the
relief
needed
to
hold
in
check
the
overstrained
feelings
of
the
crowd
i
knew
the
voice
and
cast
one
quick
glance
that
way
in
time
to
see
ella
sinking
affrightedly
out
of
sight
under
the
dismayed
looks
of
father
and
mother
then
anxious
to
note
whether
the
prisoner
had
recognised
her
too
looked
hastily
back
to
find
him
standing
quietly
and
unmoved
with
his
eyes
on
his
counsel
and
his
lips
set
in
the
stern
line
which
was
slowly
changing
his
expression
that
counsel
strangely
alive
to
the
temper
and
feelings
of
his
audience
waited
just
long
enough
for
the
few
simple
and
solemn
words
uttered
by
the
accused
man
to
produce
their
full
effect
then
with
a
side
glance
at
fox
whose
equanimity
he
had
at
last
succeeded
in
disturbing
and
whose
of
the
prisoner
he
had
still
to
fear
continued
his
own
examination
by
demanding
why
when
the
ring
was
discovered
in
adelaide
casket
and
he
saw
what
inferences
would
be
drawn
from
the
fact
he
had
not
made
an
immediate
public
explanation
of
his
conduct
and
the
reasons
he
had
had
for
putting
his
hand
there
i
not
a
muff
shot
from
the
prisoner
lips
in
his
old
manner
a
man
who
would
take
such
an
oath
in
such
a
way
and
at
such
a
time
is
not
the
man
to
talk
about
it
until
he
is
forced
to
i
would
not
talk
about
it
now
he
was
checked
at
this
point
but
the
glimpse
we
thus
obtained
of
the
natural
man
in
this
indignant
and
sullen
outburst
following
so
quickly
upon
the
solemn
declarations
of
the
moment
before
did
more
for
him
in
the
minds
of
those
present
than
the
suavest
and
most
discreet
answer
given
under
the
instigation
of
his
counsel
every
face
showed
pleasure
and
for
a
short
space
if
for
no
longer
all
who
listened
were
disposed
to
accept
his
assertions
and
accord
the
benefit
of
doubt
to
this
wayward
son
of
an
esteemed
father
to
me
who
had
hoped
nothing
from
moffat
efforts
the
substantial
nature
of
the
defence
thus
openly
made
manifest
brought
reanimation
and
an
unexpected
confidence
in
the
future
the
question
as
to
who
had
dropped
the
ring
into
the
casket
if
arthur
had
not
the
innocent
children
the
grieving
servants
was
latent
of
course
in
every
breast
but
it
had
not
yet
reached
the
point
demanding
expression
meanwhile
the
examination
proceeded
cumberland
you
have
stated
that
you
did
not
personally
drop
this
ring
into
the
place
where
it
was
ultimately
found
can
you
tell
us
of
your
own
knowledge
who
did
i
can
not
i
know
nothing
about
the
ring
i
was
much
surprised
probably
more
surprised
than
any
one
else
to
hear
of
its
discovery
in
that
place
the
slip
and
it
was
a
slip
for
him
to
introduce
that
was
immediately
taken
advantage
of
by
his
counsel
you
say
why
should
it
be
more
of
a
surprise
to
you
than
to
any
one
else
to
learn
where
this
missing
engagement
ring
of
your
sister
had
been
found
again
that
look
of
displeasure
directed
towards
his
questioner
and
a
certain
additional
hardness
in
his
reply
when
he
finally
made
it
i
was
her
brother
i
had
a
brother
antipathies
and
rightful
suspicions
i
could
not
see
how
that
ring
came
to
be
where
it
was
when
the
only
one
interested
in
its
restoration
was
in
prison
this
was
a
direct
blow
at
myself
and
of
course
called
fox
to
his
feet
with
a
motion
to
strike
out
this
answer
an
altercation
followed
between
him
and
moffat
which
deeply
as
it
involved
my
life
and
reputation
failed
to
impress
me
as
it
might
otherwise
have
done
if
my
whole
mind
had
not
been
engaged
in
reconciling
the
difficulty
about
this
ring
with
what
i
knew
of
carmel
and
the
probability
which
existed
of
her
having
been
responsible
for
its
removal
from
her
sister
hand
but
carmel
had
been
ill
since
desperately
ill
and
unconscious
she
could
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
disposal
afterwards
among
the
flowers
at
her
sister
funeral
nor
had
she
been
in
a
condition
to
delegate
this
act
of
concealment
to
another
who
then
had
been
the
intermediary
in
this
business
the
question
was
no
longer
a
latent
one
in
my
mind
it
was
an
insistent
one
compelling
me
either
to
discredit
arthur
explanation
in
which
case
anything
might
be
believed
of
him
or
to
accept
for
good
and
all
this
new
theory
that
some
person
of
unknown
identity
had
played
an
accessory
part
in
this
crime
whose
full
burden
i
had
hitherto
laid
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
impetuous
carmel
either
hypothesis
brought
light
i
began
to
breathe
again
the
air
of
hope
and
if
observed
at
that
moment
must
have
presented
the
odd
spectacle
of
a
man
rejoicing
in
his
own
shame
and
accepting
with
positive
uplift
the
inevitable
stigma
cast
upon
his
honour
by
the
suggestive
sentence
just
hurled
at
him
by
an
indignant
witness
the
point
raised
by
the
district
attorney
having
been
ruled
upon
and
sustained
by
the
court
moffat
made
no
effort
to
carry
his
inquiries
any
further
in
the
direction
indicated
but
i
could
see
with
all
my
inexperience
of
the
law
and
the
ways
of
attorneys
before
a
jury
that
the
episode
had
produced
its
inevitable
result
and
that
my
position
as
a
man
released
from
suspicion
had
received
a
shock
the
results
of
which
i
might
yet
be
made
to
feel
a
moment
pause
followed
during
which
some
of
moffat
nervousness
returned
he
eyed
the
prisoner
doubtfully
found
him
stoical
and
as
as
at
the
beginning
of
his
examination
and
plunged
into
a
topic
which
most
people
had
expected
him
to
avoid
i
certainly
had
and
felt
all
the
uncertainty
and
secret
alarm
which
an
unexpected
move
occasions
where
the
issue
is
momentous
with
life
or
death
i
was
filled
with
terror
not
for
the
man
on
trial
but
for
my
secret
was
it
shared
by
the
defence
was
moffat
armed
with
the
knowledge
i
thought
confined
to
myself
and
arthur
had
the
latter
betrayed
the
cause
i
had
been
led
to
believe
he
was
ready
to
risk
his
life
to
defend
had
i
mistaken
his
gratitude
to
myself
or
had
i
underrated
insight
or
powers
of
persuasion
we
had
just
been
made
witness
to
one
triumph
on
the
part
of
this
able
lawyer
in
a
quarter
deemed
unassailable
by
the
prosecution
were
we
about
to
be
made
witnesses
of
another
i
felt
the
sweat
start
on
my
forehead
and
was
only
able
to
force
myself
into
some
show
of
by
the
evident
lack
of
perfect
assurance
with
which
this
same
lawyer
now
addressed
his
client
the
topic
which
had
awakened
in
me
these
doubts
and
consequent
agitation
will
appear
from
the
opening
question
cumberland
to
return
to
the
night
of
your
sister
death
can
you
tell
us
what
overcoat
you
put
on
when
leaving
your
house
arthur
was
as
astonished
and
certainly
as
disconcerted
if
not
as
seriously
alarmed
as
i
was
by
this
extraordinary
move
surprise
anger
then
some
deeper
feeling
rang
in
his
voice
as
he
replied
i
can
not
i
took
down
the
first
i
saw
and
first
hat
the
emphasis
placed
on
the
last
three
words
may
have
been
meant
as
a
warning
to
his
audacious
counsel
but
if
so
it
was
not
heeded
took
down
took
down
from
where
from
the
rack
in
the
hall
where
i
hang
my
things
the
side
hall
leading
to
the
door
where
we
usually
go
out
have
you
many
coats
overcoats
i
mean
more
than
one
and
you
do
not
know
which
one
you
put
on
that
cold
night
i
do
not
but
you
know
what
one
you
wore
back
no
short
sharp
and
threatening
was
this
a
war
was
on
between
this
man
and
his
counsel
and
the
wonder
it
occasioned
was
visible
in
every
eye
perhaps
moffat
realised
this
this
was
what
he
had
dreaded
perhaps
at
all
events
he
proceeded
with
his
strange
task
in
apparent
oblivion
of
everything
but
his
own
purpose
you
do
not
know
what
one
you
wore
back
i
do
not
you
have
seen
the
hat
and
coat
which
have
been
shown
here
and
sworn
to
as
being
the
ones
in
which
you
appeared
on
your
return
to
the
house
the
day
following
your
sister
murder
i
have
also
the
hat
and
coat
found
on
a
remote
hook
in
the
closet
under
the
stairs
bearing
the
on
its
under
brim
yes
that
too
yet
can
not
say
which
of
these
two
overcoats
you
put
on
when
you
left
your
home
an
hour
or
so
after
finishing
your
dinner
trapped
by
his
own
lawyer
visibly
and
remorselessly
trapped
the
blood
shooting
suddenly
into
the
astounded
prisoner
face
was
reflected
on
the
cheeks
of
the
other
lawyers
present
even
fox
betrayed
his
surprise
but
it
was
a
surprise
not
untinged
by
apprehension
moffat
must
feel
very
sure
of
himself
to
venture
thus
far
i
who
feared
to
ask
myself
the
cause
of
this
assurance
could
only
wait
and
search
the
partially
visible
face
of
little
ella
for
an
enlightenment
which
was
no
more
to
be
found
there
than
in
the
swollen
features
of
the
outraged
arthur
the
excitement
which
this
event
caused
afforded
the
latter
some
few
moments
in
which
to
quell
his
own
indignation
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
passionately
yet
not
without
some
effort
at
restraint
i
can
not
i
was
in
no
condition
to
notice
i
was
bent
on
going
into
town
and
immediately
upon
coming
downstairs
went
straight
to
the
rack
and
pulled
on
the
first
things
that
offered
it
appeared
to
be
a
perfect
and
it
was
but
it
was
a
which
i
feared
threatened
carmel
rather
than
her
brother
moffat
still
nervous
still
avoiding
the
prisoner
eye
relentlessly
pursued
his
course
unmindful
wilfully
so
it
appeared
of
the
harm
he
was
doing
himself
as
well
as
the
witness
cumberland
were
a
coat
and
hat
all
that
you
took
from
that
hall
no
i
took
a
key
a
key
from
the
bunch
which
i
saw
lying
on
the
table
did
you
recognise
this
key
i
did
what
key
was
it
it
belonged
to
ranelagh
and
was
the
key
to
the
where
did
you
put
it
after
taking
it
up
in
my
trousers
pocket
what
did
you
do
then
went
out
of
course
without
seeing
anybody
of
course
whom
should
i
see
it
was
angrily
said
and
the
flush
which
had
begun
to
die
away
slowly
made
its
way
back
into
his
cheeks
are
you
willing
to
repeat
that
you
saw
no
one
there
was
no
one
a
lie
all
knew
it
all
felt
it
the
man
was
perjuring
himself
under
his
own
counsel
persistent
questioning
on
a
point
which
that
counsel
had
evidently
been
warned
by
him
to
avoid
i
was
assured
of
this
by
the
way
moffat
failed
to
meet
arthur
eye
as
he
pressed
on
hastily
and
in
a
way
to
forestall
all
opposition
there
are
two
ways
of
leaving
your
house
for
the
city
which
way
did
you
take
the
shortest
i
went
through
my
neighbour
grounds
to
huested
street
immediately
as
soon
as
i
could
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
immediately
did
you
stop
at
the
stable
a
pause
during
which
more
than
one
person
present
sat
breathless
these
questions
were
what
might
be
expected
from
fox
in
they
seemed
totally
unsuited
to
a
direct
examination
at
the
hands
of
his
own
counsel
what
did
such
an
innovation
mean
yes
i
stopped
at
the
stable
what
to
do
to
look
at
the
horses
why
one
of
them
had
gone
lame
i
wanted
to
see
his
condition
was
it
the
grey
mare
had
the
defence
changed
places
with
the
prosecution
it
looked
like
it
and
arthur
looked
as
if
he
considered
moffat
guilty
of
the
unheard
of
inexplainable
act
of
his
own
witness
the
situation
was
too
tempting
for
fox
to
resist
calling
additional
attention
to
it
with
an
assumption
of
extreme
consideration
he
leaned
forward
and
muttered
under
his
breath
to
his
nearest
colleague
but
still
loud
enough
for
those
about
him
to
hear
the
prisoner
must
know
that
he
is
not
bound
to
answer
questions
when
such
answers
tend
to
criminate
a
lightning
glance
shot
in
his
direction
was
the
eloquent
sole
reply
but
arthur
nettled
into
speaking
answered
the
question
put
him
in
a
loud
quick
tone
it
was
not
the
grey
mare
but
i
went
up
to
the
grey
mare
before
going
out
i
patted
her
and
bade
her
be
a
good
girl
where
was
she
then
where
she
belonged
in
her
stall
the
tones
had
sunk
so
had
the
previously
lifted
head
he
no
longer
commanded
universal
sympathy
or
credence
the
effect
of
his
former
avowals
was
almost
gone
yet
moffat
could
smile
as
i
noticed
this
and
recognised
the
satisfaction
it
evinced
my
heart
went
down
in
great
trouble
this
esteemed
advocate
the
hero
of
a
hundred
cases
was
not
afraid
to
have
it
known
that
arthur
had
harnessed
that
mare
he
even
wanted
it
known
why
there
could
be
but
one
answer
to
that
or
so
i
thought
at
the
moment
the
next
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
for
he
failed
to
pursue
this
subject
and
simply
asked
arthur
if
upon
leaving
he
had
locked
the
yes
no
i
do
remember
was
the
bungling
and
greatly
confused
reply
moffat
glanced
at
the
jury
the
smile
still
on
his
lips
did
he
wish
to
impress
that
body
with
the
embarrassment
of
his
client
relate
what
followed
i
am
sure
the
jury
will
be
glad
to
hear
your
story
from
your
own
lips
it
a
beastly
one
but
if
i
got
to
tell
it
here
it
is
i
went
straight
down
to
cuthbert
road
and
across
the
fields
to
the
i
had
not
taken
the
key
to
the
front
door
because
i
knew
of
a
window
i
could
shake
loose
i
did
this
and
went
immediately
down
to
the
i
used
an
electric
torch
of
my
own
for
light
i
pulled
out
several
bottles
and
carried
them
up
into
the
kitchen
meaning
to
light
the
gas
kindle
a
fire
and
have
a
good
time
generally
but
i
soon
found
that
i
must
do
without
light
if
i
stayed
there
the
meter
had
been
taken
out
and
to
drink
by
the
flash
of
an
electric
torch
was
anything
but
a
pleasing
prospect
besides
here
he
flashed
at
his
counsel
a
glance
which
for
a
moment
took
that
gentleman
aback
i
had
heard
certain
vague
sounds
in
the
house
which
alarmed
me
as
well
as
roused
my
curiosity
choosing
the
bottle
i
liked
best
i
went
to
investigate
these
sounds
moffat
started
his
witness
was
having
his
revenge
kept
in
ignorance
of
his
counsel
plan
of
defence
he
was
evidently
advancing
testimony
new
to
that
counsel
i
had
not
thought
the
lad
so
subtle
and
quaked
in
secret
contemplation
of
the
consequences
so
did
some
others
but
the
interest
was
intense
he
had
heard
sounds
he
acknowledged
it
but
what
sounds
observing
the
excitement
he
had
caused
and
gratified
perhaps
that
he
had
succeeded
in
driving
that
faint
but
unwelcome
smile
from
lips
arthur
hastened
to
add
but
i
did
not
complete
my
investigations
arrived
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
heard
what
drove
me
from
the
house
at
once
it
was
my
voice
adelaide
she
was
in
the
building
and
i
stood
almost
on
a
level
with
her
with
a
bottle
in
my
pocket
it
did
not
take
me
a
minute
to
clamber
through
the
window
i
did
not
stop
to
wonder
or
ask
why
she
was
there
or
to
whom
she
was
speaking
i
just
fled
and
made
my
way
as
well
as
i
could
across
the
to
a
little
hotel
on
cuthbert
road
where
i
had
been
once
before
there
i
emptied
my
bottle
and
was
so
overcome
by
it
that
i
did
not
return
home
till
noon
the
next
day
it
was
on
the
way
to
the
hill
that
i
was
told
of
the
awful
occurrence
which
had
taken
place
in
the
after
i
had
left
it
that
sobered
me
i
have
been
sober
ever
since
moffat
smile
came
back
one
might
have
said
that
he
had
been
rather
pleased
than
otherwise
by
the
introduction
of
this
unexpected
testimony
but
i
doubt
if
any
one
but
myself
witnessed
this
evidence
of
on
his
part
arthur
attitude
and
arthur
manner
had
drawn
all
eyes
to
himself
as
the
last
words
i
have
recorded
left
his
lips
he
had
raised
his
head
and
confronted
the
jury
with
a
straightforward
gaze
the
sturdiness
and
immobility
of
his
aspect
were
impressive
in
spite
of
his
plain
features
and
the
still
unmistakable
signs
of
long
cherished
discontent
and
habitual
dissipation
he
had
struck
bottom
with
his
feet
and
there
he
would
stand
or
so
i
thought
as
i
levelled
my
own
glances
at
him
but
i
had
not
fully
sounded
all
of
alonzo
moffat
resources
that
inscrutable
lawyer
and
man
seemed
determined
to
mar
every
good
impression
his
unfortunate
client
managed
to
make
ignoring
the
new
facts
just
given
undoubtedly
thinking
that
they
would
be
amply
sifted
in
the
coming
he
drew
the
attention
of
the
prisoner
to
himself
by
the
following
question
will
you
tell
us
again
how
many
bottles
of
wine
you
took
from
the
one
no
i
not
sure
about
that
i
not
sure
of
anything
i
had
only
one
when
at
the
inn
in
cuthbert
road
you
remember
but
one
i
had
but
one
one
was
enough
i
had
trouble
in
carrying
that
was
the
ground
slippery
it
was
snowy
and
it
was
uneven
i
stumbled
more
than
once
in
crossing
the
links
cumberland
is
there
anything
you
would
like
to
say
in
your
own
defence
before
i
close
this
examination
the
prisoner
thus
appealed
to
let
his
eye
rest
for
a
moment
on
the
judge
then
on
the
jury
and
finally
on
one
little
white
face
lifted
from
the
crowd
before
him
as
if
to
meet
and
absorb
his
look
then
he
straightened
himself
and
in
a
quiet
and
perfectly
natural
voice
uttered
these
simple
words
nothing
but
this
i
am
innocent
xxvi
the
syllable
of
doom
i
alit
on
a
great
ship
and
speeded
hither
on
the
sigh
of
one
who
gave
an
enemy
his
plank
then
plunged
aside
to
die
recess
followed
clifton
and
i
had
the
opportunity
of
exchanging
a
few
words
he
was
voluble
i
was
reticent
i
felt
obliged
to
hide
from
him
the
true
cause
of
the
deep
agitation
under
which
i
was
labouring
attached
as
he
was
to
me
keenly
as
he
must
have
felt
my
anomalous
position
he
was
too
full
of
moffat
unwarrantable
introduction
of
testimony
damaging
to
his
client
to
think
or
talk
of
anything
else
he
has
laid
him
open
to
attack
on
every
side
fox
has
but
to
follow
his
lead
and
the
thing
is
done
poor
arthur
may
be
guilty
but
he
certainly
should
have
every
chance
a
careful
lawyer
could
give
him
you
can
see
he
makes
it
very
evident
that
he
has
no
further
use
for
moffat
i
wonder
under
whose
advice
he
chose
him
for
his
counsel
i
have
never
thought
much
of
moffat
myself
he
wins
his
cases
but
he
will
win
this
i
muttered
clifton
started
looked
at
me
very
closely
for
a
minute
paled
a
little
i
fear
that
i
was
very
pale
myself
but
did
not
ask
the
question
rising
to
his
lips
there
is
method
in
the
madness
of
a
man
like
that
i
pursued
with
a
gloom
i
could
not
entirely
conceal
he
has
come
upon
some
evidence
which
he
has
not
even
communicated
to
his
client
at
least
i
fear
so
we
must
be
prepared
for
any
untoward
event
then
noticing
clifton
alarm
and
wishing
to
confine
it
within
safe
bounds
i
added
i
feel
that
i
am
almost
as
much
on
trial
as
arthur
himself
naturally
i
am
anxious
at
the
appearance
of
anything
i
do
not
understand
clifton
frowned
we
were
quite
alone
leaning
forward
he
touched
my
arm
elwood
said
he
you
not
been
quite
open
with
me
i
smiled
if
half
the
bitterness
and
sorrow
in
my
heart
went
into
that
smile
it
must
have
been
a
sad
and
bitter
one
indeed
you
have
a
right
to
reproach
me
said
i
but
not
wholly
i
did
not
deceive
you
in
essentials
you
may
still
believe
me
as
guiltless
of
adelaide
violent
death
as
a
man
can
be
who
drove
her
and
hers
into
misery
which
death
alone
could
end
i
will
believe
it
he
muttered
i
must
and
he
dropped
the
subject
as
he
made
me
see
forever
i
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
i
had
come
very
near
to
revealing
my
secret
when
we
returned
to
the
we
found
it
already
packed
with
a
very
subdued
and
breathless
crowd
it
differed
somewhat
from
the
one
which
had
faced
us
in
the
morning
but
ella
and
her
parents
were
there
and
many
others
of
the
acknowledged
friends
of
the
accused
and
of
his
family
he
himself
wore
the
heavy
and
dogged
air
which
became
him
least
physically
refreshed
he
carried
himself
boldly
but
it
was
a
boldness
which
convinced
me
that
any
talk
he
may
have
had
with
his
lawyer
had
been
no
more
productive
of
comfort
than
the
one
i
had
held
with
mine
as
he
took
the
witness
chair
and
prepared
to
meet
the
of
the
district
attorney
a
solemn
hush
settled
upon
the
room
would
the
coming
ordeal
rob
his
brow
of
its
present
effrontery
or
would
he
continue
to
bear
himself
with
the
same
surly
dignity
which
misunderstood
as
it
was
produced
its
own
effect
and
at
certain
moments
seemed
to
shake
even
the
confidence
of
fox
settled
as
he
seemed
to
be
in
his
belief
in
the
integrity
of
his
cause
and
the
rights
of
the
prosecution
shaken
or
not
his
attack
was
stern
swift
and
to
the
point
was
the
visit
you
made
to
the
on
the
evening
of
the
second
of
december
the
first
one
you
had
ever
paid
there
no
i
had
been
there
once
before
but
i
always
paid
for
my
depredations
he
added
proudly
the
categorical
answer
cumberland
anything
else
is
superfluous
arthur
lip
curled
but
only
for
an
instant
and
nothing
could
have
exceeded
the
impassiveness
of
his
manner
as
fox
went
on
then
you
knew
the
way
perfectly
and
the
lock
sufficiently
well
to
open
it
without
difficulty
how
long
do
you
think
you
were
in
entering
the
house
and
procuring
these
bottles
i
can
not
say
i
have
no
means
of
knowing
i
never
thought
of
looking
at
my
watch
not
when
you
started
not
when
you
left
cuthbert
road
no
sir
but
you
know
when
you
left
the
to
go
back
only
by
this
it
had
not
yet
begun
to
snow
i
told
that
the
first
flakes
fell
that
night
at
ten
minutes
to
eleven
i
was
on
the
when
this
happened
you
can
fix
the
time
yourself
pardon
me
he
added
with
decided
as
he
met
fox
frown
i
forgot
your
injunction
fox
smiled
an
acrid
smile
as
he
asked
whereabouts
on
the
they
extend
for
some
distance
you
remember
they
are
six
hundred
yards
across
from
first
tee
to
the
third
hole
which
is
the
nearest
one
to
cuthbert
road
arthur
particularised
i
was
no
i
ca
tell
you
just
where
i
was
at
that
moment
it
was
a
good
ways
from
the
house
the
snow
came
on
very
fiercely
for
a
little
while
i
could
not
see
my
way
how
not
see
your
way
the
snow
flew
into
my
eyes
crossing
the
links
yes
sir
crossing
the
links
but
the
storm
came
from
the
west
it
should
have
beaten
against
your
back
back
or
front
it
bothered
me
i
could
not
get
on
as
fast
as
i
wished
fox
cast
a
look
at
the
jury
did
they
remember
the
testimony
of
the
landlord
that
cumberland
coat
was
as
thickly
plastered
with
snow
on
the
front
as
it
had
been
on
the
back
he
seemed
to
gather
that
they
did
for
he
went
on
at
once
to
say
you
are
accustomed
to
the
links
you
have
crossed
them
often
yes
i
play
golf
there
all
summer
i
not
alluding
to
the
times
when
you
play
i
mean
to
ask
whether
or
not
you
had
ever
before
crossed
them
directly
to
cuthbert
road
yes
i
had
in
a
storm
no
not
in
a
storm
how
long
did
it
take
you
that
time
to
reach
cuthbert
road
from
the
whispering
pines
moffat
bounded
to
his
feet
but
the
prisoner
had
answered
before
he
could
speak
just
fifteen
minutes
how
came
you
to
know
the
time
so
exactly
because
that
day
i
did
look
at
my
watch
i
had
an
engagement
in
the
lower
town
and
had
only
twenty
minutes
in
which
to
keep
it
i
was
on
time
honest
at
the
core
this
boy
was
growing
rapidly
in
my
favour
but
this
frank
but
unwise
answer
was
not
pleasing
to
his
counsel
who
would
have
advised
no
doubt
a
more
general
and
less
precise
reply
however
it
had
been
made
and
moffat
was
not
a
man
to
cry
over
spilled
milk
he
did
not
even
wince
when
the
district
attorney
proceeded
to
elicit
from
the
prisoner
that
he
was
a
good
walker
not
afraid
in
the
least
of
and
had
often
walked
in
the
teeth
of
the
gale
twice
that
distance
in
less
than
half
an
hour
now
as
the
storm
that
night
had
been
at
his
back
and
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
reach
his
destination
it
was
evidently
incumbent
upon
him
to
explain
how
he
had
managed
to
use
up
the
intervening
time
of
forty
minutes
before
entering
the
hotel
at
eleven
did
you
stop
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
to
take
a
drink
asked
the
district
attorney
as
the
testimony
of
the
landlord
in
cuthbert
road
had
been
explicit
as
to
the
fact
of
his
having
himself
uncorked
the
bottle
which
the
prisoner
had
brought
into
the
hotel
arthur
could
not
plead
yes
he
must
say
no
and
he
did
i
drank
nothing
i
was
too
busy
thinking
i
was
so
busy
thinking
i
wandered
all
over
those
links
in
the
blinding
snow
yes
in
the
snow
what
did
i
care
for
the
snow
i
did
not
understand
my
sister
being
in
the
i
did
not
like
it
i
was
tempted
at
times
to
go
back
and
why
did
you
because
i
was
more
of
a
brute
than
a
brother
because
cuthbert
road
drew
me
in
spite
of
myself
because
he
stopped
with
the
first
hint
of
emotion
we
had
seen
in
him
since
the
morning
i
did
not
know
what
was
going
on
there
or
i
should
have
gone
back
he
flashed
out
with
a
defiant
look
at
his
counsel
again
sympathy
was
with
him
fox
had
won
but
little
in
this
first
attempt
he
seemed
to
realise
this
and
shifted
his
attack
to
a
point
more
vulnerable
when
you
heard
your
sister
voice
in
the
how
did
you
think
she
had
got
into
the
building
by
means
of
the
keys
ranelagh
had
left
at
the
house
when
instead
of
taking
the
whole
bunch
you
took
the
one
key
you
wanted
from
the
ring
did
you
do
so
with
any
idea
she
might
want
to
make
use
of
the
rest
no
i
never
thought
of
it
i
never
thought
of
her
at
all
you
took
your
one
key
and
let
the
rest
lie
you
said
it
was
this
before
or
after
you
put
on
your
overcoat
i
not
sure
after
i
think
yes
it
was
after
for
i
remember
that
i
had
a
deuce
of
a
time
unbuttoning
my
coat
to
get
at
my
trousers
pocket
you
dropped
this
key
into
your
trousers
pocket
i
did
cumberland
let
me
ask
you
to
fix
your
memory
on
the
moments
you
spent
in
the
hall
did
you
put
on
your
hat
before
you
pocketed
the
key
or
afterwards
my
hat
how
can
i
tell
my
mind
was
on
my
hat
i
do
know
when
i
put
it
on
you
absolutely
do
not
remember
no
nor
where
you
took
it
from
no
whether
you
saw
the
keys
first
and
then
went
for
your
hat
or
having
pocketed
the
key
waited
i
did
not
wait
did
not
stand
by
the
table
thinking
no
i
was
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
so
that
you
went
straight
out
yes
as
quickly
as
i
could
the
district
attorney
paused
to
be
sure
of
the
attention
of
the
jury
when
he
saw
that
every
eye
of
that
now
thoroughly
aroused
body
was
on
him
he
proceeded
to
ask
does
that
mean
immediately
or
as
soon
as
you
could
after
you
had
made
certain
preparations
or
held
certain
talk
with
some
one
you
called
or
who
called
to
you
i
called
to
nobody
i
i
went
out
immediately
it
was
evident
that
he
lied
evident
too
that
he
had
little
hope
from
his
lie
uneasiness
was
taking
the
place
of
confidence
in
his
youthful
untried
undisciplined
mind
carmel
had
spoken
to
him
in
the
hall
i
guessed
it
then
i
knew
it
afterward
and
he
thought
to
deceive
this
court
and
blindfold
a
jury
whose
attention
had
been
drawn
to
this
point
by
his
own
counsel
district
attorney
fox
smiled
how
then
did
you
get
into
the
stable
the
stable
oh
i
had
no
trouble
in
getting
into
the
stable
was
it
unlocked
a
slow
flush
broke
over
the
prisoner
whole
face
he
saw
where
he
had
been
landed
and
took
a
minute
to
pull
himself
together
before
he
replied
i
had
the
key
to
that
door
too
i
got
it
out
of
the
kitchen
you
have
not
spoken
of
going
into
the
kitchen
i
have
not
spoken
of
coming
downstairs
you
went
into
the
kitchen
yes
when
when
i
first
came
down
that
is
not
in
accordance
with
your
direct
testimony
on
the
contrary
you
said
that
on
coming
downstairs
you
went
straight
to
the
rack
for
your
overcoat
stenographer
read
what
the
prisoner
said
on
this
topic
a
rustling
of
leaves
distinctly
to
be
heard
in
the
deathlike
silence
of
the
room
was
followed
by
the
reading
of
this
reply
and
answer
you
can
not
say
which
of
these
two
overcoats
you
put
on
when
you
left
your
home
an
hour
or
so
after
finishing
your
dinner
can
not
i
was
in
no
condition
to
notice
i
was
bent
on
going
into
town
and
on
coming
downstairs
i
went
straight
to
the
rack
and
pulled
on
the
first
things
that
the
prisoner
stood
immobile
but
with
a
deepening
line
gathering
on
his
brow
until
the
last
word
fell
then
he
said
i
forgot
i
went
for
the
key
before
i
put
on
my
overcoat
i
wanted
to
see
how
the
sick
horse
looked
did
you
drop
this
key
into
your
pocket
too
no
i
carried
it
into
the
hall
what
did
you
do
with
it
there
i
do
know
put
it
on
the
table
i
suppose
do
you
remember
there
were
other
keys
lying
on
this
table
do
you
remember
what
you
did
with
the
one
in
your
hand
while
you
took
the
key
from
the
midst
of
ranelagh
bunch
i
laid
it
on
the
table
i
must
have
there
was
no
other
place
to
put
it
laid
it
down
by
itself
yes
and
took
it
up
when
you
went
out
of
course
carrying
it
straight
to
the
stable
naturally
what
did
you
do
with
it
when
you
came
out
i
left
it
in
the
you
did
what
excuse
have
you
to
give
for
that
none
i
was
reckless
and
did
care
for
anything
that
all
yet
you
took
several
minutes
for
all
your
hurry
and
your
indifference
to
get
the
stable
key
and
look
in
at
a
horse
that
was
sick
enough
to
keep
your
coachman
home
from
a
dance
the
prisoner
was
silent
you
have
no
further
explanation
to
give
on
this
subject
no
all
fellows
who
love
horses
will
understand
the
district
attorney
shrugged
this
answer
away
before
he
went
on
to
say
you
have
listened
to
zadok
brown
testimony
when
he
returned
at
three
he
found
the
locked
and
the
key
hanging
up
on
its
usual
nail
in
the
kitchen
how
do
you
account
for
this
there
are
two
ways
mention
them
if
you
please
zadok
had
been
to
a
dance
and
may
not
have
been
quite
clear
as
to
what
he
saw
or
finding
the
stable
door
open
may
have
blamed
himself
for
the
fact
and
sought
to
cover
up
his
fault
with
a
lie
have
you
ever
caught
him
in
a
lie
no
but
there
always
a
first
time
you
would
impeach
his
testimony
then
no
you
asked
me
how
this
discrepancy
could
be
explained
and
i
have
tried
to
show
you
cumberland
the
grey
mare
was
out
that
night
this
has
been
amply
proved
if
you
believe
zadok
yes
you
have
heard
other
testimony
corroborative
of
this
fact
she
was
seen
on
the
road
that
night
by
a
person
amply
qualified
to
identify
her
so
i
been
told
the
person
driving
this
horse
wore
a
hat
identified
as
an
old
one
of
yours
which
hat
was
afterwards
found
at
your
house
on
a
remote
peg
in
a
closet
if
you
were
not
this
person
how
can
you
explain
the
use
of
your
horse
the
use
of
your
clothes
the
locking
of
the
which
you
declare
yourself
to
have
left
open
and
the
hanging
up
of
the
key
on
its
own
nail
it
was
a
crucial
question
how
crucial
no
one
knew
but
our
two
selves
if
he
answered
at
all
he
must
compromise
carmel
i
had
no
fear
of
his
doing
this
but
i
had
great
fear
of
what
ella
might
do
if
he
let
this
implication
stand
and
made
no
effort
to
exonerate
himself
by
denying
his
presence
in
the
cutter
and
consequent
return
to
the
cumberland
home
the
quick
side
glances
i
here
observed
cast
in
her
direction
by
both
father
and
mother
showed
that
she
had
made
some
impulsive
demonstration
visible
to
them
if
not
to
others
and
fearful
of
the
consequences
if
i
did
not
make
some
effort
to
hold
her
in
check
i
kept
my
eyes
in
her
direction
and
so
lost
arthur
look
and
the
look
of
his
counsel
as
he
answered
with
just
the
word
i
had
expected
a
short
and
dogged
i
can
not
explain
it
was
my
death
warrant
i
realised
this
even
while
i
held
ella
eye
with
mine
and
smoothed
my
countenance
to
meet
the
anguish
in
hers
in
the
effort
to
hold
her
back
for
a
few
minutes
longer
till
i
could
quite
satisfy
myself
that
arthur
case
was
really
lost
and
that
i
must
speak
or
feel
myself
his
murderer
the
gloom
which
followed
this
recognition
of
his
inability
real
or
fancied
to
explain
away
the
most
damning
feature
of
the
case
against
him
taken
with
his
own
contradictions
and
growing
despondency
could
not
escape
my
eye
accustomed
as
i
was
to
the
habitual
expression
of
most
every
person
there
but
it
was
not
yet
the
impenetrable
gloom
presaging
conviction
and
directing
ella
gaze
towards
moffat
who
seemed
but
little
disturbed
either
by
fox
satisfaction
or
the
prisoner
open
despair
i
took
heart
of
grace
and
waited
for
the
district
next
move
it
was
a
fatal
one
i
began
to
recognise
this
very
soon
simple
as
was
the
subject
he
now
introduced
when
you
went
into
the
kitchen
cumberland
to
get
the
key
was
the
gas
lit
or
did
you
have
to
light
it
it
it
was
lit
i
think
do
you
know
it
was
lit
but
turned
low
i
could
see
well
enough
why
then
did
you
take
both
keys
both
keys
you
have
said
you
went
down
town
by
the
short
cut
through
your
neighbour
yard
that
cut
is
guarded
by
a
door
which
was
locked
that
night
you
needed
the
key
to
that
door
more
than
the
one
to
the
stable
why
did
you
take
it
i
i
did
you
have
said
so
i
i
took
it
when
i
took
the
other
are
you
sure
yes
they
both
hung
on
one
nail
i
grabbed
them
both
at
the
same
time
it
does
not
appear
so
in
your
testimony
you
mentioned
a
key
not
keys
in
all
your
answers
to
my
questions
there
were
two
i
did
weigh
my
words
i
needed
both
and
i
took
both
which
of
the
two
hung
foremost
i
did
notice
you
took
both
yes
i
took
both
and
went
straight
out
with
them
yes
to
the
stable
and
then
where
through
the
adjoining
grounds
downtown
you
are
sure
you
went
through
fulton
grounds
at
this
early
hour
in
the
evening
i
am
positive
was
it
not
at
a
later
hour
much
later
a
little
before
eleven
instead
of
a
little
before
nine
no
sir
i
was
on
the
then
but
some
one
drove
into
the
stable
so
you
say
unharnessed
the
horse
drew
up
the
cutter
locked
the
and
entering
the
house
hung
up
the
key
where
it
belonged
no
answer
this
time
cumberland
you
admitted
in
your
direct
examination
that
you
took
with
you
out
of
the
clubhouse
only
one
bottle
of
the
especial
brand
you
favoured
although
you
carried
up
two
into
the
kitchen
no
i
said
that
i
only
had
one
when
i
got
to
cuthbert
road
i
remember
anything
about
the
other
but
you
know
where
the
other
or
rather
remnants
of
the
other
was
found
in
my
own
stable
taken
there
by
my
man
zadok
brown
who
says
he
picked
it
out
of
one
of
our
waste
barrels
this
is
the
part
of
bottle
referred
to
do
you
recognise
the
label
still
adhering
to
it
as
similar
to
the
one
to
be
found
on
the
bottle
you
emptied
in
cuthbert
road
it
is
like
that
one
had
you
carried
that
other
bottle
off
and
had
it
been
broken
as
this
has
been
broken
would
it
not
have
presented
an
exactly
similar
appearance
to
this
possibly
only
possibly
it
would
have
looked
the
same
i
can
not
deny
it
what
the
use
fooling
cumberland
the
only
two
bottles
known
to
contain
this
especial
brand
of
wine
were
in
the
clubhouse
at
ten
that
night
how
came
one
of
them
to
get
into
the
barrel
outside
your
stable
before
your
return
the
next
day
i
can
not
say
this
barrel
stood
where
in
the
passage
behind
the
stable
the
passage
you
pass
through
on
your
way
to
the
door
leading
into
your
neighbour
grounds
yes
the
dreaded
moment
had
come
this
yes
had
no
sooner
left
arthur
lips
than
i
saw
ella
throw
out
her
innocent
arms
and
leap
impetuously
to
her
feet
with
a
loud
no
no
i
can
tell
she
did
not
say
what
for
at
the
hubbub
roused
by
this
outbreak
in
open
court
she
fainted
dead
away
and
was
carried
out
in
her
dismayed
father
arms
this
necessarily
caused
a
break
in
the
proceedings
fox
suspended
his
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
the
judge
adjourned
the
court
as
the
prisoner
rose
and
turned
to
pass
out
i
cast
him
a
hurried
glance
to
see
what
effect
had
been
made
upon
him
by
this
ingenuous
outburst
from
one
he
had
possibly
just
a
little
depreciated
a
great
one
evidently
his
features
were
transformed
and
he
seemed
almost
as
oblivious
of
the
countless
eyes
upon
him
as
she
had
been
when
she
rose
to
testify
for
him
in
her
enthusiasm
as
i
observed
this
and
the
satisfaction
with
which
moffat
scented
this
new
witness
a
satisfaction
which
promised
little
consideration
for
her
if
she
ever
came
upon
the
stand
i
surrendered
to
fate
inwardly
committing
carmel
future
to
the
god
who
made
her
and
who
knew
better
than
we
the
story
of
her
life
and
what
her
fiery
temper
had
cost
her
i
drew
a
piece
of
paper
from
my
pocket
and
while
the
courtroom
was
slowly
emptying
hastily
addressed
the
following
lines
to
moffat
who
had
lingered
to
have
a
few
words
with
his
colleague
there
is
a
witness
in
this
building
who
can
testify
more
clearly
and
definitely
than
miss
fulton
that
arthur
cumberland
for
all
we
have
heard
in
seeming
contradiction
to
the
same
might
have
been
on
the
at
the
time
he
swears
to
that
witness
is
myself
elwood
ranelagh
the
time
which
elapsed
between
my
passing
over
this
note
and
his
receiving
and
reading
it
was
to
me
like
the
last
few
moments
of
a
condemned
criminal
how
gladly
would
i
have
changed
places
with
arthur
and
with
what
sensations
of
despair
i
saw
flitting
before
me
in
my
eye
the
various
visions
of
carmel
loveliness
which
had
charmed
me
out
of
myself
but
the
die
had
been
cast
and
i
was
ready
to
meet
the
surprised
lawyer
look
when
his
eve
rose
from
the
words
i
had
written
and
settled
steadily
on
my
face
next
minute
he
was
writing
busily
and
in
a
second
later
i
was
reading
these
words
do
you
absolutely
wish
to
be
recalled
as
a
witness
and
by
the
defence
my
answer
was
brief
i
do
not
to
make
a
confession
of
crime
i
have
no
such
confession
to
make
but
i
know
who
drove
that
horse
i
had
sacrificed
carmel
to
my
sense
of
right
never
had
i
loved
her
as
i
did
at
that
moment
xxvii
expectancy
i
see
your
end
is
my
undoing
henry
a
had
been
reached
in
the
defence
that
every
one
knew
after
the
first
glance
at
moffat
on
the
opening
of
the
next
morning
session
as
i
noted
the
excitement
which
this
occasioned
even
in
quarters
where
is
usually
most
marked
and
such
emotions
suppressed
i
marvelled
at
the
subtle
influence
of
one
man
expectancy
and
the
powerful
effect
which
can
be
produced
on
a
feverish
crowd
by
a
silence
suggestive
of
coming
action
i
who
knew
the
basis
of
this
expectancy
and
the
nature
of
the
action
with
which
moffat
anticipated
startling
the
court
was
the
quietest
person
present
since
it
was
my
hand
and
none
other
which
must
give
this
fresh
turn
to
the
wheel
of
justice
it
were
well
for
me
to
do
it
calmly
and
without
any
of
the
old
maddening
throb
of
heart
but
the
time
seemed
long
before
arthur
was
released
from
further
and
the
opportunity
given
moffat
to
call
his
next
witness
something
in
the
attitude
he
now
took
something
in
the
way
he
bent
over
his
client
and
whispered
a
few
admonitory
words
and
still
more
the
emotion
with
which
these
words
were
received
and
answered
by
some
extraordinary
protest
aroused
expectation
to
a
still
greater
pitch
and
made
my
course
seem
even
more
painful
to
myself
than
i
had
foreseen
when
dreaming
over
and
weighing
the
possibilities
of
this
hour
with
something
like
terror
i
awaited
the
calling
of
my
name
and
when
it
was
delayed
it
was
with
emotions
inexplicable
to
myself
that
i
looked
up
and
saw
moffat
holding
open
a
door
at
the
left
of
the
judge
with
that
attitude
of
respect
which
a
man
only
assumes
in
the
presence
and
under
the
dominating
influence
of
woman
ella
thought
i
instead
of
saving
her
by
my
contemplated
sacrifice
of
carmel
i
have
only
added
one
sacrifice
to
another
but
when
the
timid
faltering
step
we
could
faintly
hear
crossing
the
room
beyond
had
brought
its
possessor
within
sight
and
i
perceived
the
tall
heavily
veiled
woman
who
reached
for
moffat
sustaining
arm
i
did
not
need
the
startling
picture
of
the
prisoner
standing
upright
with
outheld
and
repellant
hands
to
realise
that
the
impossible
had
happened
and
that
all
which
he
as
well
as
i
had
done
and
left
undone
suffered
and
suppressed
had
been
in
vain
moffat
with
no
eye
for
him
or
for
me
conducted
his
witness
to
a
chair
then
as
she
loosened
her
veil
and
let
it
drop
in
her
lap
he
cried
in
tones
which
rang
from
end
to
end
of
the
i
summon
carmel
cumberland
to
the
stand
to
witness
in
her
brother
defence
the
surprise
was
complete
it
was
a
great
moment
for
moffat
but
for
me
all
was
confusion
dread
a
veil
of
misty
darkness
through
which
shone
her
face
marred
by
its
ineffaceable
scar
but
calm
as
i
had
never
expected
to
see
it
again
in
this
life
and
beautiful
with
a
smile
under
which
her
deeply
shaken
and
hardly
conscious
brother
sank
slowly
back
into
his
seat
amid
a
silence
as
profound
as
the
hold
she
had
immediately
taken
upon
all
hearts
xxviii
where
is
my
brother
let
me
see
the
writing
my
lord
is
nothing
no
matter
then
who
sees
it
i
will
be
satisfied
let
me
see
the
writing
what
is
the
explanation
of
carmel
reappearance
in
town
and
of
this
sensational
introduction
of
her
into
the
in
a
restored
state
of
health
of
which
no
one
so
far
as
known
had
had
any
intimation
save
the
man
who
was
responsible
for
her
appearance
the
particulars
are
due
you
she
had
passed
some
weeks
at
lakewood
under
the
eye
of
the
nurse
who
was
detailed
to
watch
as
well
as
tend
her
during
these
weeks
she
gave
no
sign
of
improvement
mentally
though
she
constantly
gained
strength
otherwise
and
impressed
everybody
with
the
clear
light
in
her
eye
and
the
absence
of
everything
suggestive
of
gloom
in
her
expression
and
language
there
was
the
same
complete
loss
of
memory
up
to
the
time
of
the
tragic
occurrence
which
had
desolated
her
home
the
same
harping
at
odd
moments
on
adelaide
happiness
and
her
own
prospect
of
seeing
this
dear
sister
very
soon
which
had
marked
the
opening
days
of
her
convalescence
but
beyond
and
back
of
all
this
was
some
secret
joy
unintelligible
to
the
nurse
which
helped
rather
than
retarded
the
sick
girl
recovery
and
made
carmel
appear
at
times
as
if
she
walked
on
air
and
breathed
the
very
breath
of
paradise
an
anomaly
which
not
only
roused
miss
unwin
curiosity
but
led
her
to
regard
with
something
like
apprehension
any
change
in
her
patient
state
of
mind
which
would
rob
her
of
the
strange
and
unseen
delights
which
fed
her
secret
soul
and
made
her
oblivious
of
the
awful
facts
awaiting
a
restored
memory
meanwhile
carmel
was
allowed
such
liberty
as
her
condition
required
but
was
never
left
alone
for
a
moment
after
a
certain
day
when
her
eye
suddenly
took
on
a
strange
look
of
confused
inquiry
totally
dissociated
with
anything
she
saw
or
heard
a
stir
had
taken
place
in
her
brain
and
her
nurse
wanted
to
take
her
back
home
but
this
awakening
if
such
it
could
be
called
was
so
short
in
its
duration
and
was
followed
so
immediately
by
a
string
of
innocent
questions
about
adelaide
that
nurse
unwin
concluded
to
remain
a
few
days
longer
before
risking
this
delicately
balanced
mind
amid
old
scenes
and
the
curious
glances
of
her
townspeople
alas
the
awakening
was
to
take
place
in
lakewood
and
under
circumstances
of
the
most
ordinary
nature
carmel
had
been
out
and
was
just
crossing
the
hall
of
her
hotel
to
the
elevator
when
she
stopped
with
a
violent
start
and
clutching
the
air
was
caught
by
her
nurse
who
had
hurried
up
at
the
first
intimation
of
anything
unusual
in
the
condition
of
her
patient
the
cause
of
this
agitation
was
immediately
apparent
near
them
sat
two
ladies
each
with
a
small
in
her
hand
one
was
drinking
the
other
waiting
and
watching
but
with
every
apparent
intention
of
drinking
when
the
other
had
ceased
a
common
sight
enough
but
it
worked
a
revolution
in
carmel
darkened
mind
the
light
of
youthful
joyousness
fled
from
her
face
and
the
cheek
just
pulsing
softly
with
new
life
blanched
to
the
hue
of
mortal
suffering
dropping
her
eyes
from
the
women
who
saw
nothing
and
continued
to
sip
their
wine
in
happy
ignorance
of
the
going
on
within
ten
feet
of
them
she
looked
down
at
her
dress
then
up
at
the
walls
about
her
and
then
slowly
anxiously
and
with
unmistakable
terror
at
the
woman
in
whose
arms
she
felt
herself
supported
explain
she
murmured
where
am
i
at
lakewood
in
a
hotel
you
have
been
ill
and
are
only
just
recovering
her
hand
went
up
to
her
cheek
the
one
that
had
been
burned
and
still
showed
the
deep
traces
of
that
accident
i
remember
said
she
then
with
another
glance
at
her
dress
which
had
studiously
been
kept
cheerful
she
remarked
with
deep
reproach
my
sister
is
dead
why
am
i
not
in
black
the
nurse
realising
her
responsibility
she
said
afterwards
that
it
was
the
most
serious
moment
of
her
life
subdued
her
own
astonishment
at
this
proof
of
her
young
patient
knowledge
of
a
crime
of
which
she
was
universally
supposed
to
be
entirely
ignorant
and
bestowing
a
reassuring
smile
on
the
agitated
girl
observed
softly
you
wore
too
ill
to
be
burdened
with
black
you
are
better
now
and
may
assume
it
if
you
will
i
will
help
you
buy
your
mourning
yes
you
look
like
a
kind
woman
what
is
your
name
please
and
are
we
here
alone
in
this
great
hotel
now
as
a
matter
of
expediency
to
save
carmel
from
the
unendurable
curiosity
of
the
crowd
and
herself
from
the
importunities
of
the
new
york
reporters
miss
unwin
had
registered
herself
and
her
charge
under
assumed
names
she
was
therefore
forced
to
reply
my
name
is
huckins
and
we
are
here
alone
but
that
need
not
worry
you
i
have
watched
over
you
night
and
day
for
many
weeks
you
have
because
of
this
slight
burn
again
carmel
hand
went
to
her
cheek
not
on
account
of
that
only
you
have
had
a
serious
illness
quite
apart
from
that
injury
but
you
are
better
you
are
almost
well
well
enough
to
go
home
if
you
will
i
can
not
go
home
not
just
yet
i
i
not
strong
enough
but
we
should
be
here
alone
without
some
man
to
look
after
us
miss
huckins
is
my
at
this
question
uttered
with
emphasis
with
anxiety
with
indignation
even
miss
unwin
felt
the
emotion
she
had
so
successfully
subdued
up
to
this
moment
betray
itself
in
her
voice
as
she
answered
with
a
quiet
motion
towards
the
elevator
let
us
go
up
to
our
room
there
i
will
answer
all
your
questions
but
carmel
with
the
waywardness
of
her
years
or
perhaps
with
deeper
reasoning
powers
than
the
other
would
be
apt
to
attribute
to
her
broke
softly
away
from
miss
unwin
detaining
hand
and
walking
directly
into
the
office
looked
about
for
the
newspaper
stand
miss
unwin
not
to
make
a
scene
followed
but
did
not
seek
to
deter
her
until
they
were
once
again
by
themselves
in
the
centre
of
the
room
then
she
ventured
to
speak
again
we
have
all
the
papers
in
our
room
come
up
and
let
me
read
them
to
you
but
fate
was
making
ready
its
great
stroke
just
as
carmel
seemed
about
to
yield
to
this
persuasion
some
lingering
doubt
drew
her
eyes
again
to
the
stand
just
at
the
very
moment
a
boy
stepped
into
view
with
the
evening
bulletin
on
which
had
just
been
written
these
words
the
last
juror
obtained
in
the
trial
of
arthur
cumberland
for
the
murder
of
his
sister
adelaide
carmel
saw
and
stood
a
breathless
image
of
horror
a
couple
of
gentlemen
came
running
but
the
nurse
waved
them
back
and
herself
caught
carmel
and
upheld
her
in
momentary
dread
of
another
mental
if
not
physical
collapse
but
carmel
had
come
back
into
the
world
of
consciousness
to
stay
accepting
her
nurse
support
but
giving
no
sign
of
waning
faculties
or
imperfect
understanding
of
what
she
had
seen
she
spoke
quite
clearly
and
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
miss
unwin
so
that
is
why
i
am
here
away
from
all
my
friends
was
i
too
ill
to
be
told
could
you
make
me
know
what
was
happening
you
or
the
doctors
or
or
anybody
you
were
much
too
ill
protested
the
nurse
leading
her
towards
the
elevator
and
so
by
degrees
to
her
room
i
tried
to
arouse
you
after
the
crisis
of
your
illness
had
passed
but
you
seemed
to
have
forgotten
everything
which
took
place
that
night
and
the
doctors
warned
me
not
to
press
you
and
arthur
poor
arthur
has
been
the
sufferer
tell
me
the
whole
story
i
can
bear
it
she
pleaded
i
can
bear
anything
but
not
knowing
why
should
he
have
fallen
under
suspicion
he
was
not
even
there
i
must
go
to
him
pack
up
our
clothing
miss
huckins
i
must
go
to
him
at
once
they
were
in
their
own
room
now
and
carmel
was
standing
quite
by
herself
in
the
full
light
of
the
setting
sun
with
the
utterance
of
this
determination
she
had
turned
upon
her
companion
and
that
astute
and
experienced
woman
had
every
opportunity
for
observing
her
face
there
was
a
woman
resolution
in
it
with
the
sudden
rending
of
the
clouds
which
had
obscured
her
intellect
strange
powers
had
awakened
in
this
young
girl
giving
her
a
force
of
expression
which
in
connection
with
her
inextinguishable
beauty
formed
a
spectacle
before
which
this
older
woman
in
spite
of
her
long
experience
hesitated
in
doubt
you
shall
go
began
the
nurse
and
stopped
carmel
was
not
listening
another
change
of
thought
had
come
and
her
features
as
keenly
alive
now
to
every
passing
emotion
as
they
had
formerly
been
set
in
a
dull
placidity
mirrored
doubts
of
her
own
which
had
a
deeper
source
than
any
which
had
disturbed
the
nurse
even
in
these
moments
of
serious
perplexity
how
can
i
fell
in
unconscious
betrayal
from
her
lips
how
can
i
then
she
stood
silent
ghastly
with
lack
of
colour
one
minute
and
rosy
red
with
its
excess
the
next
until
it
was
hard
to
tell
in
which
extreme
her
feeling
spoke
most
truly
what
was
the
feeling
nurse
unwin
felt
it
imperative
to
know
relying
on
the
confidence
shown
her
by
this
unfortunate
girl
in
her
lonely
position
and
unbearable
distress
she
approached
carmel
with
renewed
offers
of
help
and
such
expressions
of
sympathy
as
she
thought
might
lure
her
into
open
speech
but
discretion
had
come
with
fear
and
carmel
while
not
disdaining
the
other
kindness
instantly
made
it
apparent
that
whatever
her
burden
and
however
unsuited
it
was
to
her
present
weak
condition
it
was
not
one
she
felt
willing
to
share
i
must
think
she
murmured
as
she
finally
followed
the
nurse
lead
and
seated
herself
on
a
lounge
arthur
on
trial
for
his
life
on
trial
for
his
life
and
adelaide
was
not
even
murdered
no
gasped
the
nurse
intent
on
every
word
this
witness
let
fall
had
he
no
friend
was
there
not
some
one
to
understand
adelaide
here
her
head
fell
till
her
face
was
lost
to
sight
had
a
lover
yes
elwood
ranelagh
he
was
the
first
to
be
arrested
for
the
crime
the
soul
in
carmel
seemed
to
vanish
at
this
word
the
eyes
which
had
been
so
the
moment
before
grew
blank
and
the
lithe
young
body
stiff
with
that
death
in
life
which
is
almost
worse
to
look
upon
than
death
itself
she
did
not
speak
but
presently
she
arose
as
an
automaton
might
arise
at
the
touch
of
some
invisible
spring
and
so
stood
staring
until
the
nurse
frightened
at
the
result
of
her
words
and
the
complete
overthrow
which
might
follow
them
sprang
for
a
newspaper
and
thrust
it
into
her
patient
unwilling
hand
was
it
too
late
for
a
minute
it
seemed
to
be
so
then
the
stony
eyes
softened
and
fell
the
rigidity
of
her
frame
relaxed
and
carmel
sank
back
again
on
the
sofa
and
tried
to
read
the
headlines
on
the
open
sheet
before
her
but
her
eyes
were
unequal
to
the
task
with
a
sob
she
dropped
the
paper
and
entreated
the
nurse
to
relate
to
her
from
her
own
knowledge
all
that
had
passed
sparing
her
nothing
that
would
make
the
situation
perfectly
clear
to
one
who
had
been
asleep
during
the
worst
crisis
of
her
life
miss
unwin
complied
but
with
reservations
she
told
of
adelaide
having
been
found
dead
at
the
whispering
pines
by
the
police
whom
she
had
evidently
summoned
during
a
moment
of
struggle
or
fear
of
presence
there
and
of
the
suspicions
to
which
it
gave
rise
of
his
denial
of
the
crime
of
his
strange
reticence
on
certain
points
which
served
to
keep
him
incarcerated
till
a
new
york
detective
got
to
work
and
found
so
much
evidence
against
her
brother
that
ranelagh
was
subsequently
released
and
arthur
cumberland
indicted
but
she
said
nothing
about
the
marks
on
adelaide
throat
or
of
the
special
reason
which
the
police
had
for
arresting
ranelagh
she
did
not
dare
strangulation
was
a
horrible
death
to
contemplate
and
if
this
factor
in
the
crime
she
was
not
deceived
by
carmel
exclamation
that
there
had
been
no
murder
was
unknown
as
yet
to
her
patient
as
it
must
be
from
what
she
had
said
and
the
absolute
impossibility
as
she
thought
of
her
having
known
what
went
on
in
the
whispering
pines
then
it
had
better
remain
unknown
to
her
until
circumstances
forced
it
on
her
knowledge
or
she
had
gotten
sufficient
strength
to
bear
it
carmel
received
the
account
well
she
started
when
she
heard
of
the
discovery
of
ranelagh
in
the
on
the
entrance
of
the
police
and
seemed
disposed
to
ask
some
questions
but
though
the
nurse
gave
her
an
opportunity
to
do
so
she
appeared
to
hunt
in
vain
for
the
necessary
words
and
the
narrative
proceeded
without
further
interruption
when
all
was
done
she
sat
quite
still
then
carefully
and
with
a
show
of
more
judgment
than
might
be
expected
from
one
of
her
years
she
propounded
certain
inquiries
which
brought
out
the
main
causes
for
her
arraignment
when
she
had
these
fully
in
mind
she
looked
up
into
the
nurse
face
again
and
repeated
quite
calmly
but
with
immovable
decision
the
order
of
an
hour
before
we
must
return
at
once
you
will
pack
up
immediately
miss
unwin
nodded
and
began
to
open
the
trunks
this
however
was
a
ruse
she
did
not
intend
to
take
her
patient
back
that
night
she
was
afraid
to
risk
it
the
next
day
would
be
soon
enough
but
she
would
calm
her
by
making
ready
and
when
the
proper
moment
came
would
find
some
complication
of
trains
which
would
interfere
with
their
immediate
departure
meanwhile
she
would
communicate
at
the
earliest
moment
with
fox
she
had
been
in
the
habit
of
sending
him
frequent
telegrams
as
to
her
patient
condition
they
had
been
invariable
so
far
no
difference
mind
still
a
blank
or
some
code
word
significant
of
the
same
but
a
new
word
was
necessary
now
she
must
look
it
up
and
formulate
her
telegram
before
she
did
anything
else
the
was
in
her
top
tray
she
hunted
and
hunted
for
it
without
being
able
to
lay
her
hands
on
it
she
grew
very
nervous
she
was
only
human
she
was
in
a
very
trying
position
and
she
realised
it
where
could
that
book
be
suddenly
she
espied
it
and
falling
on
her
knees
before
the
trunk
with
her
back
still
to
carmel
studied
out
the
words
she
wanted
she
was
leaning
over
the
tray
to
write
these
words
in
her
when
no
one
ever
knew
how
it
happened
the
lid
of
the
heavy
trunk
fell
forward
and
its
iron
edge
struck
her
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
with
a
keen
blow
which
laid
her
senseless
when
carmel
reached
her
side
she
found
herself
the
strong
one
and
her
stalwart
nurse
the
patient
when
help
had
been
summoned
the
accident
explained
and
everything
done
for
the
unconscious
woman
which
medical
skill
could
suggest
carmel
finding
a
moment
to
herself
stole
to
the
trunk
and
lifting
up
the
lid
looked
in
she
had
been
watchful
of
her
nurse
from
the
first
and
was
suspicious
of
the
actions
which
had
led
to
this
untoward
accident
seeing
the
two
little
books
she
took
them
out
the
lay
open
and
on
the
page
thus
disclosed
she
beheld
written
ap
lox
fidestum
truhum
ridiculous
nonsense
until
she
consulted
the
code
then
these
detached
and
meaningless
words
took
on
a
significance
which
she
could
not
afford
to
ignore
ap
a
change
lox
makes
remarkable
statements
fidestum
shall
we
return
trubum
not
tractable
carmel
endeavoured
to
find
out
for
whom
this
telegram
was
intended
there
was
nothing
to
inform
her
a
moment
of
indecision
was
followed
by
quick
action
she
had
noticed
that
she
had
been
invariably
addressed
as
miss
campbell
by
every
one
who
had
come
into
the
room
whether
this
was
a
proof
of
the
care
with
which
she
had
been
guarded
from
the
curiosity
of
strangers
or
whether
it
was
part
of
a
system
of
deception
springing
from
quite
different
causes
she
felt
that
in
the
present
emergency
it
was
a
fact
to
be
thankful
for
and
to
be
utilised
regaining
her
own
room
which
was
on
the
other
side
of
their
common
she
collected
a
few
necessary
articles
and
placed
them
in
a
bag
which
she
thrust
under
her
bed
hunting
for
money
she
found
quite
an
adequate
amount
in
her
own
purse
which
was
attached
to
her
person
satisfied
thus
far
she
chose
her
most
inconspicuous
hat
and
coat
and
putting
them
on
went
out
by
her
own
door
into
the
corridor
the
time
it
was
the
favoured
her
attempt
she
found
her
way
to
the
office
unobserved
and
going
frankly
up
to
the
clerk
informed
him
that
she
had
some
telegrams
to
send
and
that
she
would
be
out
for
some
little
time
would
he
see
that
miss
huckins
was
not
neglected
in
her
absence
the
clerk
startled
at
these
evidences
of
sense
and
in
one
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
under
the
special
protection
of
the
very
woman
she
was
now
confiding
to
his
care
surveyed
her
eloquent
features
beaming
with
quiet
resolve
and
for
a
moment
seemed
at
a
loss
how
to
take
this
change
and
control
the
strange
situation
perhaps
she
understood
him
perhaps
she
only
followed
the
impulses
natural
to
her
sex
she
never
knew
she
only
remembers
that
she
smiled
and
that
his
hesitation
vanished
at
that
smile
i
will
see
to
it
said
he
then
as
she
turned
to
go
he
ventured
to
add
it
is
quite
dark
now
if
you
would
like
one
of
the
boys
to
go
with
you
but
he
received
no
encouragement
and
allowed
his
suggestion
to
remain
unfinished
she
looked
grateful
for
this
and
was
pulling
down
her
veil
when
she
perceived
two
or
three
men
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
watching
her
in
evident
wonder
stepping
back
to
the
desk
she
addressed
the
clerk
again
this
time
with
a
marked
distinctness
i
have
been
very
ill
i
know
and
not
always
quite
myself
but
the
shock
of
this
accident
to
my
nurse
has
cleared
my
brain
and
made
me
capable
again
of
attending
to
my
own
affairs
you
can
trust
me
i
can
do
my
errands
all
right
but
perhaps
i
had
better
have
one
of
the
boys
go
with
me
the
clerk
greatly
relieved
rang
his
bell
and
the
gentlemen
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
sauntered
elsewhere
to
exchange
their
impressions
of
an
incident
which
was
remarkable
enough
in
itself
without
the
accentuation
put
upon
it
by
the
extreme
beauty
of
the
girl
and
the
one
conspicuous
blemish
to
that
beauty
her
unfortunate
scar
with
what
additional
wonder
would
they
have
regarded
the
occurrence
had
they
known
that
the
object
of
their
interest
was
not
an
unknown
miss
campbell
but
the
much
pitied
much
carmel
cumberland
sister
of
the
man
then
on
trial
for
his
life
in
a
new
york
town
with
her
first
step
into
the
street
carmel
freshly
freed
mind
began
its
work
she
knew
she
was
in
a
place
called
lakewood
but
she
knew
little
of
its
location
save
that
it
was
somewhere
in
new
jersey
another
strange
thing
she
did
not
recognise
the
streets
they
were
new
to
her
she
did
not
remember
ever
having
been
in
them
before
where
is
the
railroad
station
she
inquired
of
the
boy
who
was
trotting
along
at
her
side
over
there
he
answered
vaguely
take
me
to
it
he
obeyed
and
they
threaded
several
streets
whose
lighted
shops
pleased
her
notwithstanding
her
cares
such
a
joy
it
was
to
be
alive
to
things
once
more
and
capable
of
remembrance
even
though
remembrance
brought
visions
at
which
she
shuddered
and
turned
away
appalled
the
sight
of
the
station
from
which
a
train
was
just
leaving
frightened
her
for
a
moment
with
its
bustle
and
many
lights
but
she
rallied
under
the
stress
of
her
purpose
and
entering
found
the
telegraph
office
from
which
she
sent
this
message
directed
to
her
physician
at
home
carpenter
look
for
me
on
early
train
all
is
clear
to
me
now
and
i
must
return
preserve
silence
till
we
meet
this
she
signed
with
a
pet
name
known
only
to
themselves
and
dating
back
to
her
childish
days
then
she
bought
a
ticket
and
studied
the
when
quite
satisfied
she
returned
to
the
hotel
she
was
met
in
the
doorway
by
the
physician
who
was
attending
the
miss
huckins
he
paused
when
he
saw
her
and
asked
a
few
questions
which
she
was
penetrating
enough
to
perceive
were
more
for
the
purpose
of
testing
her
own
condition
than
to
express
interest
in
his
patient
she
answered
quietly
and
was
met
by
a
surprise
and
curiosity
which
evinced
that
he
was
greatly
drawn
towards
her
case
this
alarmed
her
she
did
not
wish
to
be
the
object
of
any
one
notice
on
the
contrary
she
desired
to
obliterate
herself
to
be
counted
out
so
far
as
all
these
people
were
concerned
but
above
all
she
was
anxious
not
to
rouse
suspicion
so
she
stopped
and
talked
as
naturally
as
she
could
about
miss
huckins
accident
and
what
the
prospects
were
for
the
night
these
were
favourable
or
so
the
doctor
declared
but
the
injured
woman
condition
called
for
great
care
and
he
would
send
over
a
capable
nurse
meanwhile
the
maid
who
was
with
her
would
do
very
well
she
herself
need
have
no
worry
he
would
advise
against
worry
and
suggested
that
she
should
have
a
good
and
nourishing
dinner
sent
to
her
room
after
which
she
should
immediately
retire
and
get
what
sleep
she
could
by
means
of
an
anodyne
he
would
send
her
carmel
exerted
herself
you
are
very
good
said
she
i
need
no
anodyne
i
tired
and
when
i
once
get
to
bed
shall
certainly
sleep
i
shall
give
orders
not
to
be
disturbed
is
that
right
quite
right
i
will
myself
tell
the
nurse
he
was
going
but
turned
to
look
at
her
again
shall
i
accompany
you
to
the
door
of
your
room
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
with
a
smile
this
delay
was
a
torment
to
her
but
it
must
be
endured
i
am
quite
capable
of
finding
my
room
i
hope
miss
huckins
will
be
as
well
in
a
week
from
now
as
i
am
at
this
moment
but
doctor
she
had
been
struck
by
a
strange
possibility
i
should
like
to
settle
one
little
matter
before
we
part
the
money
i
have
may
not
be
quite
safe
in
my
hands
my
memory
might
leave
me
again
and
then
miss
huckins
might
suffer
if
you
will
take
charge
of
some
of
it
on
her
account
i
shall
feel
relieved
it
would
be
a
wise
precaution
he
admitted
but
you
could
just
as
well
leave
it
at
the
desk
so
i
can
she
smiled
then
as
his
eye
remained
fixed
on
her
you
are
wondering
if
i
have
friends
we
both
have
and
i
have
just
come
from
telegraphing
to
one
of
them
you
can
leave
us
with
an
easy
mind
all
that
i
dread
is
that
miss
huckins
will
worry
about
me
if
her
consciousness
should
return
during
the
night
it
will
not
return
so
soon
next
week
we
may
look
for
it
then
you
can
be
by
to
reassure
her
if
she
asks
for
you
carmers
eyes
fell
i
would
not
be
a
cause
of
distress
to
her
for
the
world
she
has
been
very
good
to
me
bowing
she
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
office
the
doctor
lifting
his
hat
took
his
departure
the
interview
might
have
lasted
five
minutes
she
felt
as
though
it
had
lasted
an
hour
she
followed
the
doctor
advice
and
left
half
the
money
she
had
in
charge
of
the
clerk
then
she
went
upstairs
she
was
not
seen
to
come
down
again
but
when
the
train
started
out
of
the
station
that
night
it
had
for
a
passenger
a
young
heavily
veiled
girl
who
went
straight
to
her
section
a
balcony
running
by
her
window
had
favoured
her
escape
it
led
to
a
hall
window
at
the
head
of
a
side
staircase
she
met
no
one
on
the
staircase
and
once
out
of
the
door
at
its
foot
her
difficulties
were
over
and
her
escape
effected
she
was
missed
the
next
morning
and
an
account
of
her
erratic
flight
reached
the
papers
and
was
published
far
and
wide
but
the
name
of
miss
caroline
campbell
conveyed
nothing
to
the
public
and
the
great
trial
went
on
without
a
soul
suspecting
the
significance
of
this
midnight
flitting
of
an
unknown
and
partially
demented
girl
at
the
house
of
carpenter
she
met
moffat
what
she
told
him
heartened
him
greatly
for
the
struggle
he
saw
before
him
indeed
it
altered
the
whole
tone
of
the
defence
perceiving
from
her
story
and
from
what
the
doctor
could
tell
him
of
their
meeting
at
the
station
that
her
return
to
town
was
as
yet
a
secret
to
every
one
but
themselves
he
begged
that
the
secret
should
continue
to
be
kept
in
order
that
the
which
he
meditated
might
lose
none
of
its
force
by
anticipation
carmel
whose
mind
was
full
of
her
coming
ordeal
was
willing
enough
to
hide
her
head
until
it
came
while
carpenter
alarmed
at
all
this
excitement
would
have
insisted
on
it
in
any
event
carmel
wished
her
brother
informed
of
her
return
but
the
wily
lawyer
persuaded
her
to
excuse
him
from
taking
arthur
into
his
confidence
until
the
last
moment
he
knew
that
he
would
receive
only
opposition
from
his
young
and
stubborn
client
that
carmel
presence
and
determination
would
have
to
be
sprung
upon
arthur
even
more
than
upon
the
prosecution
that
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
would
struggle
to
the
very
last
against
carmel
appearance
in
court
and
make
an
infinite
lot
of
trouble
if
he
did
not
actually
endanger
his
own
cause
one
of
the
stipulations
which
he
had
made
in
securing
moffat
for
his
counsel
was
that
carmel
name
was
to
be
kept
as
much
as
possible
out
of
the
proceedings
and
to
this
moffat
had
subscribed
notwithstanding
his
conviction
that
the
crime
laid
to
the
defendant
charge
was
a
result
of
ranelagh
passion
for
carmel
and
consequently
distinctly
the
work
of
ranelagh
own
hand
he
had
thought
that
he
could
win
his
case
by
the
powers
of
oratory
and
a
somewhat
free
use
of
innuendo
but
his
view
changed
under
the
fresh
enlightenment
which
he
received
in
his
conversation
with
carmel
he
saw
unfolding
before
him
a
defence
of
unparalleled
interest
true
it
involved
this
interesting
witness
in
a
way
that
would
be
unpleasant
to
the
brother
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
sacrifice
a
client
to
any
sentimental
scruple
certainly
not
this
client
whose
worth
he
was
just
beginning
to
realise
professional
pride
as
well
as
an
inherent
love
of
justice
led
him
to
this
conclusion
nothing
in
god
world
appealed
to
him
or
ever
had
appealed
to
him
like
a
prisoner
in
the
dock
facing
a
fate
from
which
only
legal
address
added
to
an
orator
eloquence
could
save
him
his
sympathies
went
out
to
a
man
so
placed
even
when
he
was
a
brute
and
his
guilt
far
from
doubtful
how
much
more
then
must
he
feel
the
claims
of
this
surly
but
boy
son
of
a
good
father
and
pious
mother
who
had
been
made
the
butt
of
circumstances
and
of
whose
innocence
he
was
hourly
becoming
more
and
more
convinced
could
he
have
probed
the
whole
matter
examined
and
this
new
witness
until
every
detail
was
his
and
the
whole
story
of
that
night
stood
bare
before
him
he
might
have
hesitated
a
little
longer
and
asked
himself
some
very
serious
questions
but
carmel
was
not
strong
enough
for
much
talk
carpenter
would
not
allow
it
and
the
continued
clearness
of
her
mind
was
too
invaluable
to
his
case
for
this
advocate
to
take
any
risk
she
had
told
him
enough
to
assure
him
that
circumstances
and
not
guilt
had
put
arthur
where
he
was
and
had
added
to
the
assurance
details
of
an
unexpected
nature
so
unexpected
indeed
that
the
lawyer
was
led
away
by
the
prospect
they
offered
of
confounding
the
prosecution
by
a
line
of
defence
to
which
no
clew
had
been
given
by
anything
that
had
appeared
he
planned
then
and
there
a
dramatic
climax
which
should
take
the
breath
away
from
his
opponent
and
change
the
whole
feeling
of
the
court
towards
the
prisoner
it
was
a
glorious
prospect
and
if
the
girl
remained
well
the
bare
possibility
of
her
not
doing
so
drove
him
prematurely
from
her
presence
and
so
it
happened
that
for
the
second
time
the
subject
of
adelaide
death
was
discussed
in
her
hearing
without
any
mention
being
made
of
strangulation
as
its
immediate
cause
would
her
action
have
been
different
had
she
known
that
this
was
a
conceded
fact
moffat
did
not
repeat
this
visit
he
was
not
willing
to
risk
his
secret
by
being
seen
too
often
at
the
doctor
house
but
telephonic
communication
was
kept
up
between
him
and
her
present
guardian
and
he
was
able
to
bear
himself
quietly
and
with
confidence
until
the
time
drew
near
for
the
introduction
of
her
testimony
then
he
grew
nervous
fearing
that
nurse
unwin
would
come
to
herself
and
telegraph
carmel
escape
and
so
prepare
the
prosecution
for
his
great
stroke
but
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
and
when
the
great
day
came
he
had
only
to
consider
how
he
should
prepare
arthur
for
the
surprise
awaiting
him
and
finally
decided
not
to
prepare
him
at
all
but
simply
to
state
at
the
proper
moment
and
in
the
face
of
the
whole
that
his
sister
had
recovered
and
would
soon
take
her
place
upon
the
stand
the
restraint
of
the
place
would
thus
act
as
a
guard
between
them
and
carmel
immediate
entrance
put
an
end
to
the
reproaches
of
whose
bitterness
he
could
well
judge
from
his
former
experience
of
them
with
all
these
anxieties
and
his
deeply
planned
awaiting
the
moment
of
action
ella
simple
outburst
and
even
unexpected
and
somewhat
startling
suggestion
lost
much
of
their
significance
all
his
mind
and
heart
were
on
his
next
move
it
was
to
be
made
with
the
queen
and
must
threaten
checkmate
yet
he
did
not
forget
the
two
pawns
silent
in
their
places
but
guarding
certain
squares
which
the
queen
for
all
her
royal
prerogatives
might
not
be
able
to
reach
book
four
what
the
pines
whispered
xxix
i
remembered
the
room
if
thou
mightst
dwell
among
the
gods
the
while
lapped
in
voluptuous
joy
i
would
not
quit
this
bleak
ravine
these
unrepentant
pains
great
moments
whether
of
pain
surprise
or
terror
awaken
in
the
startled
breast
very
different
emotions
from
those
we
are
led
to
anticipate
from
the
agitation
caused
by
lesser
experiences
as
carmel
disclosed
her
features
to
the
court
my
one
absorbing
thought
was
would
she
look
at
me
could
i
hope
for
a
glance
of
her
eye
did
i
wish
it
my
question
was
answered
before
moffat
had
regained
his
place
and
turned
to
address
the
court
as
her
gaze
passed
from
her
brother
face
it
travelled
slowly
and
with
growing
hesitation
over
the
countenances
of
those
near
her
on
and
on
past
the
judge
past
the
jury
until
they
reached
the
spot
where
i
sat
there
they
seemed
to
falter
and
the
beating
of
my
heart
became
so
loud
that
i
instinctively
shrank
away
from
my
neighbour
by
so
doing
i
drew
her
eye
which
fell
full
upon
mine
for
one
overwhelming
minute
then
she
shrank
and
looked
away
but
not
before
the
colour
had
risen
in
a
flood
to
her
cheek
the
hope
which
had
sprung
to
life
under
her
first
beautiful
aspect
vanished
in
despair
at
sight
of
this
flush
for
it
was
not
one
of
joy
or
surprise
or
even
of
unconscious
sympathy
it
was
the
banner
of
a
deep
unendurable
shame
versed
in
her
every
expression
i
could
not
mistake
the
language
of
her
dismayed
soul
at
this
the
most
critical
instant
of
her
life
she
had
hoped
to
find
me
absent
she
was
overwhelmed
to
find
me
there
could
she
with
a
look
have
transported
me
a
thousand
miles
from
this
scene
of
personal
humiliation
and
unknown
unimaginable
outcome
she
would
have
bestowed
that
look
and
ignored
the
consequences
nor
was
i
behind
her
in
the
reckless
passion
of
the
moment
could
i
by
means
of
a
wish
have
been
transported
those
thousand
miles
i
should
even
now
have
been
far
from
a
spot
where
in
the
face
of
a
curious
crowd
busy
in
associating
us
together
i
must
submit
to
the
terror
of
hearing
her
speak
and
betray
herself
to
these
watchful
lawyers
and
to
the
just
and
impartial
mind
of
the
presiding
judge
but
the
days
of
magic
had
passed
i
could
not
escape
the
spot
i
could
not
escape
her
eye
the
ordeal
to
which
she
was
thus
committed
i
must
share
as
she
advanced
step
by
step
upon
her
uncertain
road
it
would
be
my
unhappy
fate
to
advance
with
her
in
terror
of
the
same
pitfalls
with
our
faces
set
towards
the
same
precipice
slipping
fainting
experiencing
agonies
together
she
knew
my
secret
and
i
alas
knew
hers
so
i
interpreted
this
intolerable
overwhelming
blush
recoiling
from
the
prospect
i
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
and
so
missed
the
surprising
sight
of
this
young
girl
still
in
her
teens
conquering
a
dismay
which
might
well
unnerve
one
of
established
years
and
untold
experiences
in
a
few
minutes
as
i
was
afterward
told
by
my
friends
her
features
had
settled
into
a
strange
placidity
undisturbed
by
the
levelled
gaze
of
a
hundred
eyes
her
whole
attention
was
concentrated
on
her
brother
and
wavered
only
when
the
duties
of
the
occasion
demanded
a
recognition
of
the
various
gentlemen
concerned
in
the
trial
moffat
prefaced
his
examination
by
the
following
words
may
it
please
your
honour
i
wish
to
ask
the
indulgence
of
the
court
in
my
examination
of
this
witness
she
is
just
recovering
from
a
long
and
dangerous
illness
and
while
i
shall
endeavour
to
keep
within
the
rules
of
examination
i
shall
be
grateful
for
any
consideration
which
may
be
shown
her
by
your
honour
and
by
the
counsel
on
the
other
side
fox
at
once
rose
he
had
by
this
time
recovered
from
his
astonishment
at
seeing
before
him
and
in
a
fair
state
of
health
the
young
girl
whom
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
to
be
still
in
a
condition
of
partial
forgetfulness
at
lakewood
and
under
the
care
of
a
woman
entirely
in
his
confidence
and
under
his
express
orders
he
had
also
mastered
his
chagrin
at
the
triumph
which
her
presence
here
and
under
these
dramatic
circumstances
had
given
his
adversary
moved
perhaps
by
miss
cumberland
beauty
which
he
saw
for
the
first
time
or
perhaps
by
the
spectacle
of
this
beauty
devoting
its
first
hours
of
health
to
an
attempt
to
save
a
brother
of
whose
precarious
position
before
the
law
she
had
been
ignorant
up
to
this
time
or
more
possibly
yet
by
a
fear
that
it
might
be
bad
tactics
to
show
harshness
to
so
interesting
a
personality
before
she
had
uttered
a
word
of
testimony
he
expressed
in
warmer
tones
than
usual
his
deep
desire
to
extend
every
possible
indulgence
moffat
bowed
his
acknowledgments
and
waited
for
his
witness
to
take
the
oath
which
she
did
with
a
simple
grace
which
touched
all
hearts
even
that
of
her
constrained
and
unreconciled
brother
compelled
by
the
silence
and
my
own
bounding
pulses
to
look
at
her
in
my
own
despite
i
caught
the
sweet
and
elevated
look
with
which
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
book
and
asked
myself
if
her
presence
here
was
not
a
which
would
bring
satisfaction
to
nobody
which
would
sink
her
and
hers
into
an
ignominy
worse
than
the
conviction
of
the
brother
whom
she
was
supposedly
there
to
save
tortured
by
this
fear
i
awaited
events
in
indescribable
agitation
the
cool
voice
of
moffat
broke
in
upon
my
gloom
carmel
had
reseated
herself
after
taking
the
oath
and
the
customary
question
could
be
heard
your
name
if
you
please
carmel
cumberland
do
you
recognise
the
prisoner
miss
cumberland
yes
he
is
my
brother
a
thrill
ran
through
the
room
the
lingering
tone
the
tender
accent
told
some
of
the
feeling
she
thus
expressed
seemed
to
pass
into
every
heart
which
contemplated
the
two
from
this
moment
on
he
was
looked
upon
with
less
harshness
people
showed
a
disposition
to
discern
innocence
where
perhaps
they
had
secretly
desired
until
now
to
discover
guilt
miss
cumberland
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
us
where
you
were
at
or
near
the
hour
of
ten
on
the
evening
of
your
sister
death
i
was
in
the
in
the
house
you
call
the
whispering
pines
at
this
astounding
reply
unexpected
by
every
one
present
save
myself
and
the
unhappy
prisoner
incredulity
seasoned
with
amazement
marked
every
countenance
carmel
cumberland
in
the
that
night
she
who
had
been
found
at
a
late
hour
in
her
own
home
injured
and
unconscious
it
was
not
to
be
believed
or
it
would
not
have
been
if
arthur
with
less
than
he
had
hitherto
maintained
had
not
shown
by
his
morose
air
and
the
silent
drooping
of
his
head
that
he
accepted
this
statement
wild
and
improbable
as
it
seemed
fox
whose
mind
without
doubt
had
been
engaged
in
a
debate
from
the
first
as
to
the
desirability
of
challenging
the
testimony
of
this
young
girl
whose
faculties
had
so
lately
recovered
from
a
condition
of
great
shock
and
avowed
forgetfulness
that
no
word
as
yet
had
come
to
him
of
her
restored
health
started
to
arise
at
her
words
but
noting
the
prisoner
attitude
he
hastily
reseated
himself
realising
perhaps
that
evidence
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
client
manner
and
the
complacency
if
so
then
his
own
air
of
mingled
disbelief
and
compassionate
forbearance
might
strike
the
jury
unfavourably
while
on
the
contrary
if
his
doubts
were
sound
and
the
witness
were
confounding
the
fancies
of
her
late
delirium
with
the
actual
incidents
of
this
fatal
night
then
would
he
gain
rather
than
lose
by
allowing
her
to
proceed
until
her
testimony
fell
of
its
own
weight
or
succumbed
before
the
fire
of
his
modifying
his
manner
he
steadied
himself
for
either
exigency
and
in
steadying
himself
steadied
his
colleagues
also
moffat
who
saw
everything
smiled
slightly
as
he
spoke
encouragingly
to
his
witness
and
propounded
his
next
question
miss
cumberland
was
your
sister
with
you
when
you
went
to
the
no
we
went
separately
how
will
you
explain
i
drove
there
i
do
know
how
adelaide
went
you
drove
there
yes
i
had
arthur
harness
up
his
horse
for
me
and
i
drove
there
a
moment
of
silence
then
a
slow
awakening
on
the
part
of
judge
jury
and
prosecution
to
the
fact
that
the
case
was
taking
a
turn
for
which
they
were
to
moffat
it
was
a
moment
of
intense
and
something
of
the
gratification
he
felt
crept
into
his
voice
as
he
said
miss
cumberland
will
you
describe
this
horse
it
was
a
grey
horse
it
has
a
large
black
spot
on
its
left
shoulder
to
what
vehicle
was
it
attached
to
a
cutter
my
brother
cutter
was
that
brother
with
you
did
he
accompany
you
in
your
ride
to
the
whispering
pines
no
i
went
quite
alone
entrancement
had
now
seized
upon
every
mind
even
if
her
testimony
were
not
true
but
merely
the
wanderings
of
a
mind
not
fully
restored
the
interest
of
it
was
intense
fox
glancing
at
the
jury
saw
there
would
be
small
use
in
questioning
at
this
time
the
mental
capacity
of
the
witness
this
was
a
story
which
all
wished
to
hear
perhaps
he
wished
to
hear
it
too
moffat
rose
to
more
than
his
accustomed
height
the
light
which
sometimes
visited
his
face
when
feeling
or
a
sense
of
power
was
strongest
in
him
shone
from
his
eye
and
irradiated
his
whole
aspect
as
he
inquired
tellingly
and
how
did
you
return
with
whom
and
by
what
means
did
you
regain
your
own
house
the
answer
came
with
simple
directness
in
the
same
way
i
went
i
drove
back
in
my
brother
cutter
and
being
all
alone
just
as
before
i
put
the
horse
away
myself
and
went
into
my
empty
home
and
up
to
adelaide
room
where
i
lost
consciousness
the
excitement
which
had
been
seething
broke
out
as
she
ceased
but
the
judge
did
not
need
to
use
his
gavel
or
the
officers
of
the
court
exert
their
authority
at
moffat
lifted
hand
the
turmoil
ceased
as
if
by
magic
miss
cumberland
do
you
often
ride
out
alone
on
nights
like
that
i
never
did
before
i
would
not
have
dared
to
do
it
then
if
i
had
not
taken
a
certain
precaution
and
what
was
this
precaution
i
wore
an
old
coat
of
my
brother
over
my
dress
and
one
of
his
hats
on
my
head
it
was
out
the
fact
for
the
suppression
of
which
i
had
suffered
arrest
without
a
word
because
of
which
arthur
had
gone
even
further
and
submitted
to
trial
with
the
same
constancy
instinctively
his
eyes
and
mine
met
and
at
that
moment
there
was
established
between
us
an
understanding
that
was
in
strong
contrast
to
the
surrounding
turmoil
which
now
exceeded
all
limits
as
the
highly
wrought
up
spectators
realised
that
these
statements
if
corroborated
destroyed
one
of
the
strongest
points
which
had
been
made
by
the
prosecution
this
caused
a
stay
in
the
proceedings
until
order
was
partially
restored
and
the
judge
voice
could
be
heard
in
a
warning
that
the
would
be
cleared
of
all
spectators
if
this
break
of
decorum
was
repeated
meanwhile
my
own
mind
had
been
busy
i
had
watched
arthur
i
had
watched
moffat
the
discouragement
of
the
former
the
elation
of
the
latter
proved
the
folly
of
any
hope
on
my
part
that
carmel
would
be
spared
a
full
explanation
of
what
i
would
have
given
worlds
to
leave
in
the
darkness
and
ignorance
of
the
present
moment
to
save
arthur
unwilling
as
he
was
she
was
to
be
allowed
to
consummate
the
sacrifice
which
the
real
generosity
of
her
heart
drove
her
into
making
before
these
doors
opened
again
and
sent
forth
the
crowd
now
pulsating
under
a
preamble
of
whose
terrible
sequel
none
as
yet
dreamed
i
should
have
to
hear
those
sweet
lips
give
utterance
to
the
revelation
which
would
consign
her
to
opprobrium
and
break
not
only
my
heart
but
her
brother
was
there
no
way
to
stop
it
the
district
attorney
gave
no
evidence
of
suspecting
any
issue
of
this
sort
nor
did
the
friendly
and
humane
judge
only
the
scheming
moffat
knew
to
what
all
this
was
tending
and
moffat
could
not
be
trusted
the
case
was
his
and
he
would
gain
it
if
he
could
tender
and
obliging
as
he
was
in
his
treatment
of
the
witness
there
was
iron
under
the
velvet
of
his
glove
this
was
his
reputation
and
this
i
must
now
see
exemplified
before
me
without
the
power
to
stop
it
the
consideration
with
which
he
approached
his
subject
did
not
deceive
me
miss
cumberland
will
you
now
give
the
jury
the
full
particulars
of
that
evening
occurrences
as
witnessed
by
yourself
begin
your
relation
if
you
please
with
an
account
of
the
last
meal
you
had
together
carmel
hesitated
her
youth
her
conscience
perhaps
shrank
in
manifest
distress
from
this
inquisition
ask
me
a
question
she
prayed
i
do
not
know
how
to
begin
very
well
who
were
seated
at
the
that
night
my
sister
my
brother
ranelagh
and
myself
did
anything
uncommon
happen
during
the
meal
yes
my
sister
ordered
wine
and
had
our
glasses
all
filled
she
never
drank
wine
herself
but
she
had
her
glass
filled
also
then
she
dismissed
helen
the
waitress
and
when
the
girl
was
gone
she
rose
and
held
up
her
glass
and
invited
us
to
do
the
same
will
drink
to
my
coming
marriage
said
she
but
when
we
had
done
this
she
turned
upon
arthur
with
bitter
words
about
his
habits
and
declaring
that
another
bottle
of
wine
should
never
be
opened
again
in
the
house
unclosed
her
fingers
and
let
her
glass
drop
on
the
table
where
it
broke
arthur
then
let
his
fall
and
i
mine
we
all
three
let
our
glasses
fall
and
break
and
mr
ranelagh
he
did
not
let
his
fall
he
set
it
down
on
the
cloth
he
had
not
drank
from
it
clear
perfectly
clear
tallying
with
what
we
had
heard
from
other
sources
as
this
fact
forced
itself
in
upon
the
minds
of
the
jury
new
light
shone
in
every
eye
and
each
and
all
waited
eagerly
for
the
next
question
it
came
with
a
quiet
if
not
insinuating
intonation
miss
cumberland
where
were
you
looking
when
you
let
your
glass
fall
my
heart
gave
a
bound
i
remembered
that
moment
well
so
did
she
as
could
be
seen
from
the
tremulous
flush
and
the
determination
with
which
she
forced
herself
to
speak
at
ranelagh
she
answered
finally
not
at
your
brother
no
and
at
whom
was
ranelagh
looking
at
at
me
not
at
your
sister
no
was
anything
said
not
then
with
the
dropping
of
the
glasses
we
all
drew
back
from
the
table
and
walked
towards
a
little
room
where
we
sometimes
sat
before
going
into
the
library
arthur
went
first
and
ranelagh
and
i
followed
adelaide
coming
last
we
we
went
this
way
into
the
little
room
and
what
other
question
do
you
wish
to
ask
she
finished
with
a
burning
blush
moffat
was
equal
to
the
appeal
did
anything
happen
did
ranelagh
speak
to
you
or
you
to
him
or
did
your
sister
adelaide
speak
no
one
spoke
but
ranelagh
put
a
little
slip
of
paper
into
my
hand
a
a
note
as
he
did
this
my
brother
looked
round
i
do
know
whether
he
saw
the
note
or
not
but
his
eye
caught
mine
and
i
may
have
blushed
next
moment
he
was
looking
past
me
and
presently
he
had
flung
himself
out
of
the
room
and
i
heard
him
going
upstairs
adelaide
had
joined
me
by
this
time
and
ranelagh
turned
to
speak
to
her
and
and
i
went
over
to
the
to
read
my
note
and
did
you
read
it
then
no
i
was
afraid
i
waited
till
ranelagh
was
gone
then
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
read
it
it
was
not
a
a
note
to
be
glad
of
i
mean
proud
of
i
afraid
i
was
a
little
glad
of
it
at
first
i
was
a
wicked
girl
moffat
glanced
at
fox
but
that
gentleman
passing
over
this
artless
expression
of
feeling
as
unworthy
an
objection
he
went
steadily
on
miss
cumberland
before
you
tell
us
about
this
note
will
you
be
good
enough
to
inform
us
whether
any
words
passed
between
you
and
your
sister
before
you
went
upstairs
oh
yes
we
talked
we
all
three
talked
but
it
was
about
indifferent
matters
the
servants
were
going
to
a
ball
and
we
spoke
of
that
ranelagh
did
not
stay
long
very
soon
he
remarked
that
he
had
a
busy
evening
before
him
and
took
his
leave
i
was
not
in
the
room
with
them
when
he
did
this
i
was
in
the
adjoining
one
but
i
heard
his
remark
and
saw
him
go
i
did
not
wait
to
talk
to
adelaide
now
about
the
note
i
read
it
as
soon
as
i
reached
my
room
then
i
sat
still
for
a
long
time
miss
cumberland
pardon
my
request
but
will
you
tell
us
what
was
in
that
note
she
lifted
her
patient
eyes
and
looked
straight
at
her
brother
he
did
not
meet
her
gaze
but
the
dull
flush
which
lit
up
the
of
his
cheek
showed
how
he
suffered
under
this
ordeal
at
me
she
never
glanced
this
was
the
only
mercy
shown
me
that
dreadful
morning
i
grew
to
be
thankful
for
it
as
she
went
on
i
do
not
remember
the
words
she
said
finally
as
her
eyes
fell
again
to
her
lap
but
i
remember
its
meaning
it
was
an
invitation
for
me
to
leave
town
with
him
that
very
evening
and
be
married
at
some
place
he
mentioned
he
said
it
would
be
the
best
way
to
to
end
matters
this
brought
fox
to
his
feet
for
all
his
he
had
been
perceptibly
growing
more
and
more
nervous
as
the
examination
proceeded
and
he
found
himself
still
in
the
dark
as
to
his
purpose
and
the
character
of
the
revelations
he
had
to
fear
turning
to
the
judge
he
cried
this
testimony
is
irrelevant
and
incompetent
and
i
ask
to
have
it
stricken
out
moffat
voice
as
he
arose
to
answer
this
was
like
honey
poured
upon
gall
it
is
neither
irrelevant
nor
incompetent
and
if
it
were
the
objection
comes
too
late
my
friend
should
have
objected
to
the
question
the
whole
course
of
counsel
has
been
very
unusual
began
fox
yes
but
so
is
the
case
i
beg
your
honour
to
believe
that
in
some
of
its
features
this
case
is
not
only
unusual
but
almost
without
a
precedent
that
it
may
be
lightly
understood
and
justice
shown
my
client
a
full
knowledge
of
the
whole
family
experiences
during
those
fatal
hours
is
not
only
desirable
but
absolutely
essential
i
beg
therefore
that
my
witness
may
be
allowed
to
proceed
and
tell
her
story
in
all
its
details
nothing
will
be
introduced
which
will
not
ultimately
be
seen
to
have
a
direct
bearing
upon
the
attitude
of
my
client
towards
the
crime
for
which
he
stands
here
arraigned
the
motion
is
denied
declared
the
judge
fox
sat
down
to
the
universal
relief
of
all
but
the
two
persons
most
interested
arthur
and
myself
moffat
generous
enough
or
discreet
enough
to
take
no
note
of
his
opponent
discomfiture
lifted
a
paper
from
the
table
and
held
it
towards
the
witness
do
you
recognise
these
lines
he
asked
placing
the
remnants
of
my
communication
in
her
hands
she
started
at
sight
of
them
evidently
she
had
never
expected
to
see
them
again
yes
she
answered
after
a
moment
this
is
a
portion
of
the
note
i
have
mentioned
you
recognise
it
as
such
i
do
her
eyes
lingered
on
the
scrap
and
followed
it
as
it
was
passed
back
and
marked
as
an
exhibit
moffat
recalled
her
to
the
matter
in
hand
what
did
you
do
next
miss
cumberland
i
answered
the
note
may
i
ask
to
what
effect
i
refused
ranelagh
request
i
said
that
i
could
not
do
what
he
asked
and
told
him
to
wait
till
the
next
day
and
he
would
see
how
i
felt
towards
him
and
towards
adelaide
that
was
all
i
could
not
write
much
i
was
suffering
greatly
suffering
in
mind
or
suffering
in
body
suffering
in
my
mind
i
was
terrified
but
that
feeling
did
not
last
very
long
soon
i
grew
happy
happier
than
i
had
been
in
weeks
happier
than
i
had
ever
been
in
all
my
life
before
i
found
that
i
loved
adelaide
better
than
i
did
myself
this
made
everything
easy
even
the
sending
of
the
answer
i
have
told
you
about
to
mr
ranelagh
miss
cumberland
how
did
you
get
this
answer
to
mr
ranelagh
by
means
of
a
gentleman
who
was
going
away
on
the
very
train
i
had
been
asked
to
leave
on
he
was
a
guest
next
door
and
i
carried
the
note
in
to
him
did
you
do
this
openly
no
i
afraid
not
i
slipped
out
by
the
side
door
in
as
careful
a
way
as
i
could
did
this
attempt
at
secrecy
succeed
were
you
able
to
go
and
come
without
meeting
any
one
no
adelaide
was
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
when
i
came
back
standing
there
very
stiff
and
quiet
did
she
speak
to
you
no
she
just
looked
at
me
but
it
was
a
common
look
i
shall
never
forget
it
and
what
did
you
do
then
i
went
to
my
room
miss
cumberland
did
you
sec
anybody
else
when
you
came
in
at
this
time
yes
our
maid
helen
she
was
just
laying
down
a
bunch
of
keys
on
the
table
in
the
lower
hall
i
stopped
and
looked
at
the
keys
i
had
recognised
them
as
the
ones
i
had
seen
in
ranelagh
hands
many
times
he
had
gone
yet
there
were
his
keys
one
of
them
unlocked
the
i
noticed
it
among
the
others
but
i
did
touch
it
then
helen
was
still
in
the
hall
and
i
ran
straight
upstairs
where
i
met
my
sister
as
i
have
just
told
you
miss
cumberland
continue
the
story
what
did
you
do
after
your
room
i
do
know
what
i
did
first
i
was
very
excited
elated
one
minute
deeply
wretched
and
very
frightened
the
next
i
must
have
sat
down
for
i
was
shaking
very
much
and
felt
a
little
sick
the
sight
of
that
key
had
brought
up
pictures
of
the
and
i
thought
and
thought
how
quiet
it
was
and
how
far
away
and
how
cold
it
was
too
and
how
secret
i
would
go
there
for
what
i
had
to
do
and
then
i
saw
in
my
fancy
one
of
its
rooms
with
the
moon
in
it
and
but
i
soon
shut
my
eyes
to
that
i
heard
arthur
moving
about
his
room
and
this
made
me
start
up
and
go
out
into
the
hall
again
during
all
this
fox
had
sat
by
understanding
his
right
to
object
to
the
witness
mixed
statements
of
fact
and
of
feelings
and
quite
confident
that
his
objections
would
be
sustained
but
he
had
determined
long
since
that
he
would
not
interrupt
the
witness
in
her
relation
the
air
of
patience
he
assumed
was
sufficiently
indicative
of
his
displeasure
and
he
confined
himself
to
this
moffat
understood
and
testified
his
appreciation
by
a
slight
bow
carmel
who
saw
nothing
resumed
her
story
arthur
room
is
near
and
adelaide
far
off
but
i
went
to
first
her
door
was
shut
and
when
i
went
to
open
it
i
found
it
locked
calling
her
name
i
said
that
i
was
tired
and
would
be
glad
to
say
good
night
she
did
not
answer
at
once
when
she
did
her
voice
was
strange
though
what
she
said
was
very
simple
i
was
to
please
myself
she
was
going
to
retire
too
and
then
she
tried
to
say
good
night
but
she
only
half
said
it
like
one
who
is
choked
with
tears
or
some
other
dreadful
emotion
i
can
not
tell
you
how
this
made
me
feel
but
you
do
care
for
that
you
want
to
know
what
i
did
what
adelaide
did
i
will
tell
you
but
i
can
not
hurry
every
act
of
the
evening
was
so
crowded
with
purpose
all
meant
so
much
i
can
see
the
end
but
the
steps
leading
to
it
are
not
so
clear
take
your
time
miss
cumberland
we
have
no
wish
to
hurry
you
i
can
go
on
now
the
next
thing
i
did
was
to
knock
at
arthur
door
i
heard
him
getting
ready
to
go
out
and
i
wanted
to
speak
to
him
before
he
went
when
he
heard
me
he
opened
the
door
and
let
me
in
he
began
at
once
on
his
grievances
but
i
could
not
listen
to
them
i
wanted
him
to
harness
the
grey
mare
for
me
and
leave
it
standing
in
the
stable
i
explained
the
request
by
saying
that
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
see
a
certain
friend
of
mine
immediately
and
that
no
one
would
notice
me
in
the
cutter
under
the
he
did
approve
but
i
persuaded
him
i
even
persuaded
him
to
wait
till
zadok
was
gone
so
that
adelaide
would
know
nothing
about
it
he
looked
glum
but
he
promised
he
was
going
away
when
i
heard
adelaide
steps
in
the
adjoining
room
this
frightened
me
the
partition
is
very
thin
between
these
two
rooms
and
i
was
afraid
she
had
heard
me
ask
arthur
for
the
grey
mare
and
cutter
i
could
hear
her
rattling
the
bottles
in
the
medicine
cabinet
hanging
on
this
very
wall
looking
back
at
arthur
i
asked
him
how
long
adelaide
had
been
there
he
said
some
time
this
sent
me
flying
from
the
room
i
would
join
her
and
find
out
if
she
had
heard
but
i
was
too
late
as
i
stepped
into
the
hall
i
saw
her
disappearing
round
the
corner
leading
to
her
own
room
this
convinced
me
that
she
had
heard
nothing
and
light
of
heart
once
more
i
went
back
to
my
own
room
where
i
collected
such
little
articles
as
i
needed
for
the
expedition
before
me
i
had
hardly
done
this
when
i
heard
the
servants
on
the
walk
outside
then
arthur
going
down
the
impulse
to
see
and
speak
to
him
again
was
irresistible
i
flew
after
him
and
caught
him
in
the
lower
hall
i
cried
at
me
look
at
me
well
and
then
kiss
me
and
he
did
kiss
me
i
glad
when
i
think
of
it
though
he
did
say
next
minute
is
the
matter
with
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
meet
that
villain
i
looked
straight
into
his
face
i
waited
till
i
saw
i
had
his
whole
attention
then
i
said
as
slowly
and
emphatically
as
i
could
you
mean
elwood
no
i
shall
never
meet
him
again
except
in
presence
he
will
not
want
to
meet
me
you
may
be
at
ease
about
that
all
will
be
well
and
adelaide
very
happy
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
reached
for
his
coat
and
hat
as
he
was
putting
them
on
i
said
forget
to
harness
up
jenny
jenny
is
the
grey
mare
leave
off
the
bells
i
urged
do
want
adelaide
to
hear
me
go
out
he
swung
about
at
this
and
adelaide
are
not
very
good
friends
it
seems
good
as
you
and
she
are
i
answered
then
i
flung
my
arms
about
him
go
down
street
i
prayed
home
for
this
one
night
stay
in
the
house
with
adelaide
stay
till
i
come
home
he
stared
and
i
saw
his
colour
change
then
he
flung
me
off
but
not
rudely
do
stay
he
asked
then
he
laughed
and
added
go
harness
the
mare
key
in
the
kitchen
i
said
go
get
it
for
you
i
heard
zadok
bring
it
in
he
did
not
answer
and
i
went
for
the
key
i
found
two
on
the
nail
and
i
brought
them
both
but
i
only
handed
him
one
the
key
to
the
way
are
you
going
i
asked
as
he
looked
at
the
key
then
back
towards
the
kitchen
short
way
of
course
here
the
key
to
the
fulton
grounds
as
he
took
the
key
i
prayed
again
do
what
in
your
mind
arthur
do
drink
he
only
laughed
and
i
said
my
last
word
you
do
it
will
be
for
the
last
time
you
never
drink
again
after
he
made
no
answer
to
this
and
i
went
slowly
upstairs
everything
was
quiet
quiet
as
death
in
the
whole
house
if
adelaide
had
heard
us
she
made
no
sign
going
to
my
own
room
i
waited
until
i
heard
arthur
come
out
of
the
stable
and
go
away
by
the
door
in
the
rear
wall
then
i
stole
out
again
i
carried
a
small
bag
with
me
but
no
coat
or
hat
pausing
and
listening
again
and
again
i
crept
downstairs
and
halted
at
the
table
under
the
rack
the
keys
were
still
there
putting
them
in
my
bag
i
searched
the
rack
for
one
of
my
brother
warm
coats
but
i
took
none
i
saw
i
remembered
an
old
one
which
adelaide
had
put
away
in
the
closet
under
the
stairs
getting
this
i
put
it
on
and
finding
a
hat
there
too
i
took
that
also
and
when
i
had
pulled
it
over
my
forehead
and
drawn
up
the
collar
of
the
coat
i
was
quite
unrecognisable
i
was
going
out
when
i
remembered
there
would
be
no
light
in
the
i
had
put
a
box
of
matches
in
my
bag
while
i
was
upstairs
but
i
needed
a
candle
slipping
back
i
took
a
candlestick
and
candle
from
the
mantel
and
finding
that
the
bag
would
not
hold
them
thrust
them
into
the
pocket
of
the
coat
i
wore
and
quickly
left
the
house
jenny
was
in
the
stable
all
harnessed
and
hesitating
no
longer
i
got
in
among
the
and
drove
swiftly
away
there
was
a
moment
silence
carmel
had
paused
and
was
sitting
with
her
hand
on
her
heart
looking
past
judge
past
jury
upon
the
lonely
and
desolate
scene
in
which
she
at
this
moment
moved
and
suffered
an
inexpressible
fatality
had
entered
into
her
tones
always
rich
and
resonant
with
feeling
no
one
who
listened
could
fail
to
share
the
dread
by
which
she
was
moved
district
attorney
fox
fumbled
with
his
papers
and
endeavoured
to
maintain
his
equanimity
and
show
an
indifference
which
his
stern
but
fascinated
glances
at
the
youthful
witness
amply
belied
he
was
biding
his
time
but
biding
it
in
decided
perturbation
of
mind
neither
he
nor
any
one
else
unless
it
were
moffat
could
tell
whither
this
tale
tended
while
she
held
the
straight
course
which
had
probably
been
laid
out
for
her
he
failed
to
object
but
he
could
not
prevent
the
subtle
influence
of
her
voice
her
manner
and
her
supreme
beauty
on
the
entranced
jury
nevertheless
his
pencil
was
busy
he
was
still
sufficiently
master
of
himself
for
that
moffat
quite
aware
of
the
effect
which
was
being
produced
on
every
side
but
equally
careful
to
make
no
show
of
it
put
in
a
commonplace
question
at
this
point
possibly
to
rouse
the
witness
from
her
own
abstraction
possibly
to
restore
the
judicial
tone
of
the
inquiry
how
did
you
leave
the
open
can
you
tell
us
what
time
it
was
when
you
started
no
i
did
not
look
time
meant
nothing
to
me
i
drove
as
fast
as
i
could
straight
down
the
hill
and
out
towards
the
whispering
pines
i
had
seen
adelaide
in
her
window
as
i
went
flying
by
the
house
but
not
a
soul
on
the
road
nor
a
sign
of
life
near
or
far
the
whistle
of
a
train
blew
as
i
stopped
in
the
thicket
near
the
door
if
it
was
the
express
train
you
can
tell
never
mind
the
said
moffat
it
is
enough
that
you
heard
the
whistle
go
on
with
what
you
did
i
tied
up
my
horse
then
i
went
into
the
house
i
had
used
ranelagh
key
to
open
the
door
and
for
some
reason
i
took
it
out
of
the
lock
when
i
got
in
and
put
the
whole
bunch
back
into
my
satchel
but
i
did
not
lock
the
door
then
i
lit
my
candle
and
then
i
went
upstairs
fainter
and
fainter
the
words
fell
and
slower
and
slower
heaved
the
youthful
breast
under
her
heavily
pressing
palm
moffat
made
a
sign
across
the
and
i
saw
carpenter
get
up
and
move
nearer
to
the
witness
stand
but
she
stood
in
no
need
of
his
help
in
an
instant
her
cheek
flushed
the
eye
i
watched
with
such
intensity
of
wonder
that
apprehension
unconsciously
left
me
rose
glowed
and
fixed
itself
at
last
not
on
the
judge
not
on
the
prisoner
not
even
on
that
counsel
but
on
and
as
the
soft
light
filled
my
soul
and
awoke
awe
where
it
had
hitherto
awakened
passion
she
quietly
said
there
is
a
room
upstairs
in
the
where
i
have
often
been
with
adelaide
it
has
a
fireplace
in
it
and
i
had
seen
a
box
there
half
filled
with
wood
the
day
before
this
is
the
room
i
went
to
and
here
i
built
a
fire
when
it
was
quite
bright
i
took
out
something
i
had
brought
in
my
satchel
and
thrust
it
into
the
flame
then
i
got
up
and
walked
away
i
i
did
not
feel
very
strong
and
sank
on
my
knees
when
i
got
to
the
couch
and
buried
my
face
in
my
arms
but
i
felt
better
when
i
came
back
to
the
fire
again
and
very
brave
till
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
my
face
in
the
mirror
over
the
mantelpiece
that
that
unnerved
me
and
i
think
i
screamed
some
one
screamed
and
i
think
it
was
i
know
my
hands
went
out
i
saw
them
in
the
glass
then
they
fell
straight
down
at
my
side
and
i
looked
and
looked
at
myself
till
i
saw
all
the
terror
go
out
of
my
face
and
when
it
was
quite
calm
again
i
stooped
down
and
pulled
out
the
little
tongs
i
had
been
heating
in
the
fire
and
laid
them
quick
quick
before
i
could
be
sorry
again
right
across
my
cheek
and
then
uproar
in
the
court
if
she
had
screamed
when
she
said
she
did
so
some
one
cried
out
loudly
now
i
think
that
pitiful
person
was
myself
they
say
i
had
been
standing
straight
up
in
my
place
for
the
last
two
minutes
xxx
choose
let
me
have
a
dram
of
poison
such
soon
speeding
geer
as
will
disperse
itself
through
all
the
veins
that
the
taker
may
fall
dead
come
bitter
conduct
come
unsavoury
guide
thou
desperate
pilot
now
at
once
run
on
the
dashing
rocks
thy
weary
bark
and
i
have
not
finished
were
the
first
words
we
heard
when
order
was
restored
and
we
were
all
in
a
condition
to
listen
again
i
had
to
relate
what
you
have
just
heard
that
you
might
understand
what
happened
next
i
was
not
used
to
pain
and
i
could
never
have
kept
on
pressing
those
irons
to
my
cheek
if
i
had
not
had
the
strength
given
me
by
my
own
reflection
in
the
glass
when
i
thought
the
burn
was
quite
deep
enough
i
tore
the
tongs
away
and
was
lifting
them
to
the
other
cheek
when
i
saw
the
door
behind
me
open
inch
by
inch
as
thought
pushed
by
hesitating
touches
instantly
i
forgot
my
pain
almost
my
purpose
watching
that
door
i
saw
it
slowly
swing
to
its
full
width
and
disclose
my
sister
standing
in
the
gap
with
a
look
and
in
an
attitude
which
terrified
me
more
than
the
fire
had
done
dropping
the
tongs
i
turned
and
faced
her
covering
my
cheek
instinctively
with
my
hand
i
saw
her
eyes
run
over
my
elaborate
dinner
dress
my
little
and
the
candle
burning
in
a
room
made
warm
with
a
fire
on
the
hearth
this
before
she
spoke
a
single
word
then
with
a
deep
labouring
breath
she
looked
me
in
the
eye
again
with
the
simple
question
where
is
he
carmel
head
had
drooped
at
this
but
she
raised
it
almost
instantly
mine
did
not
rise
so
readily
you
mean
elwood
i
asked
know
said
she
veil
is
down
between
us
carmel
we
will
speak
plainly
now
i
saw
him
give
you
the
letter
i
heard
you
ask
arthur
to
harness
up
the
horse
i
have
demeaned
myself
to
follow
you
and
we
will
have
no
subterfuges
now
you
expect
him
here
i
cried
am
not
so
bad
as
that
adelaide
nor
is
he
here
is
the
note
you
will
see
by
it
what
he
expects
and
at
what
place
i
should
have
joined
him
if
i
had
been
the
selfish
creature
you
think
i
had
the
note
hidden
in
my
breast
i
took
it
out
and
held
it
towards
her
i
did
not
feel
the
burn
at
all
but
i
kept
it
covered
she
glanced
down
at
the
words
and
i
felt
like
falling
at
her
feet
she
looked
so
miserable
i
am
told
that
i
must
keep
to
fact
and
must
not
express
my
feelings
or
those
of
others
i
will
try
to
remember
this
but
it
is
hard
for
a
sister
relating
such
a
frightful
scene
she
glanced
down
at
the
paper
and
let
it
drop
almost
immediately
from
her
hand
can
not
read
his
words
she
cried
do
not
need
to
we
both
know
which
of
us
he
loves
best
you
can
not
say
that
it
is
i
his
engaged
wife
i
was
silent
and
her
face
took
on
an
awful
pallor
said
she
you
know
what
this
man
love
has
been
to
me
you
are
a
child
a
and
passionate
child
but
you
do
not
know
a
woman
heart
certainly
you
do
not
know
mine
i
doubt
if
any
one
does
even
he
cares
have
warped
my
life
i
do
not
quarrel
with
these
cares
i
only
say
that
they
have
robbed
me
of
what
makes
girlhood
lovely
duty
is
a
stern
and
sternness
coming
early
into
one
life
hardens
its
edges
but
does
not
sap
passion
from
the
soul
or
devotion
from
the
heart
i
was
ready
for
joy
when
it
came
but
i
was
no
longer
capable
of
bestowing
it
i
thought
i
was
but
i
soon
saw
my
mistake
you
showed
it
to
me
you
with
your
beauty
your
freshness
your
warm
and
untried
heart
i
have
no
charms
to
rival
these
i
have
only
love
such
love
as
you
can
not
dream
of
at
your
age
and
is
no
longer
desirable
to
him
you
see
that
i
remember
every
word
she
spoke
they
burned
more
fiercely
than
the
iron
that
did
not
burn
at
all
just
then
i
was
cold
instead
bitterly
awfully
cold
my
very
heart
seemed
frozen
and
the
silence
was
dreadful
but
i
could
not
speak
i
could
not
answer
her
have
everything
she
now
went
on
did
you
rob
me
of
my
one
happiness
and
you
have
robbed
me
i
have
seen
your
smile
when
his
head
turned
your
way
it
was
the
smile
which
runs
before
a
promise
i
know
it
i
have
had
that
smile
in
my
heart
a
long
long
time
but
it
never
reached
my
lips
carmel
do
you
know
why
i
am
here
i
shook
my
head
was
it
her
teeth
that
were
chattering
or
mine
am
here
to
end
it
all
said
she
my
hope
gone
my
heart
laid
waste
life
has
no
prospect
for
me
i
believe
in
god
and
i
know
that
my
act
is
sinful
but
i
can
no
more
live
than
can
a
tree
stricken
at
the
root
he
will
not
need
to
write
notes
he
can
come
and
comfort
you
in
our
home
but
never
let
him
look
at
me
as
we
are
sisters
and
i
almost
a
mother
to
you
shut
my
face
away
from
his
eyes
or
i
shall
rise
in
my
casket
and
the
tangle
of
our
lives
will
be
renewed
i
tell
you
this
i
bare
my
sister
broken
heart
to
you
giving
you
her
very
words
sacred
as
they
are
to
me
and
and
to
others
who
are
present
and
must
listen
to
all
i
say
because
it
is
right
that
you
should
understand
her
frenzy
and
know
all
that
passed
between
us
in
that
awful
hour
this
was
irregular
highly
irregular
but
district
attorney
fox
sat
on
unmoved
possibly
he
feared
to
prejudice
the
jury
possibly
he
recognised
the
danger
of
an
interruption
now
not
only
to
the
continuity
of
her
testimony
but
to
the
witness
herself
or
what
is
just
as
likely
possibly
he
cherished
a
hope
that
in
giving
her
a
free
rein
and
allowing
her
to
tell
her
story
thus
artlessly
she
would
herself
supply
the
clew
he
needed
to
reconstruct
his
case
on
the
new
lines
upon
which
it
was
being
slowly
forced
by
these
unexpected
revelations
whatever
the
cause
he
let
these
expressions
of
feeling
pass
at
a
gesture
from
moffat
carmel
proceeded
i
tottered
at
this
threat
and
she
a
mother
to
me
from
my
cradle
started
instinctively
to
catch
me
but
the
feeling
left
her
before
she
had
taken
two
steps
and
she
stopped
still
your
hand
she
cried
want
to
see
your
whole
face
while
i
ask
you
one
last
question
i
could
not
read
the
note
why
did
you
come
i
dropped
my
hand
and
she
stood
staring
then
she
uttered
a
cry
and
ran
quickly
towards
me
is
it
she
cried
has
happened
to
you
is
it
the
shadow
or
i
caught
her
by
the
hand
i
could
speak
now
said
i
are
not
the
only
one
to
love
to
the
point
of
hurt
i
love
let
this
little
scar
be
witness
then
as
her
eyes
opened
and
she
staggered
i
caught
her
to
my
breast
and
hid
my
face
on
her
shoulder
say
that
i
shall
be
free
to
receive
notes
he
will
not
wish
to
write
them
tomorrow
the
beauty
he
liked
is
gone
if
it
weighed
overmuch
with
him
then
you
and
i
are
on
a
plane
again
or
i
am
on
an
inferior
one
your
joy
will
be
sweeter
for
this
break
she
started
raised
my
head
from
her
shoulder
looked
at
me
and
shuddered
but
no
longer
with
hate
she
whispered
story
the
story
i
read
you
of
francis
the
first
and
i
agreed
made
me
think
her
knees
bent
under
her
she
sank
at
my
feet
but
her
eyes
never
left
my
face
and
elwood
knows
nothing
i
did
not
make
up
my
mind
till
adelaide
it
had
to
be
i
had
the
strength
to
to
leave
you
all
or
or
to
say
no
if
he
ever
asked
me
to
my
face
what
he
asked
me
in
that
note
and
then
i
tried
to
lift
her
but
she
was
kissing
my
feet
kissing
my
dress
sobbing
out
her
life
on
my
hands
oh
i
was
happy
my
future
looked
very
simple
to
me
but
my
cheek
began
to
burn
and
instinctively
i
put
up
my
hand
this
brought
her
to
her
feet
are
suffering
she
cried
must
go
home
at
once
at
once
while
i
telephone
to
carpenter
will
go
together
i
said
can
telephone
from
there
but
at
this
the
awful
look
came
back
into
her
face
and
seeing
her
forget
my
hurt
i
forgot
it
too
in
dread
of
what
she
would
say
when
she
found
strength
to
speak
it
was
worse
than
anything
i
had
imagined
she
refused
absolutely
to
go
back
home
said
she
have
done
injustice
to
your
youth
you
love
him
too
not
like
a
child
but
a
woman
the
tangle
is
worse
than
i
thought
your
heart
is
caught
in
it
as
well
as
mine
and
you
shall
have
your
chance
my
death
will
give
it
to
you
i
shook
my
head
pointing
to
my
cheek
she
shook
hers
and
quietly
calmly
said
have
never
looked
so
beautiful
should
we
go
back
together
and
take
up
the
old
life
the
struggle
which
has
undermined
my
conscience
and
my
whole
existence
would
only
begin
again
i
can
not
face
that
ordeal
carmel
the
morning
light
would
bring
me
daily
torture
the
evening
dusk
a
night
of
blasting
dreams
we
three
can
not
live
in
this
world
together
i
am
the
least
loved
and
so
i
should
be
the
one
to
die
i
am
determined
carmel
life
with
me
has
come
to
this
i
tried
to
dissuade
her
i
urged
every
plea
even
that
of
my
own
sacrifice
but
she
was
no
more
her
natural
self
she
had
taken
up
the
note
and
read
it
during
my
entreaties
and
my
words
fell
on
deaf
ears
these
words
have
killed
me
she
cried
crumpling
the
note
in
her
hand
will
a
little
poison
do
it
can
only
finish
what
he
has
begun
poison
i
remembered
how
i
had
heard
her
pushing
about
bottles
in
the
medicine
cabinet
and
felt
my
legs
grow
weak
and
my
head
swim
will
not
i
cried
watching
her
hand
in
terror
of
seeing
it
rise
to
her
breast
are
crazed
you
will
feel
differently
but
the
fixed
set
look
of
her
bleak
face
gave
me
no
hope
shall
never
feel
differently
if
i
do
not
end
it
i
shall
do
so
soon
when
a
heart
like
mine
goes
down
it
goes
down
forever
i
could
only
shudder
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
which
way
to
turn
she
stood
between
me
and
the
door
and
her
presence
was
terrible
i
came
here
she
said
brought
a
bottle
of
cordial
with
me
and
three
glasses
i
brought
a
little
phial
of
poison
too
once
ordered
for
sickness
i
expected
to
find
elwood
here
if
i
had
i
meant
to
drop
the
poison
into
one
glass
and
then
fill
them
all
up
with
the
cordial
we
should
have
drunk
each
one
of
us
his
glass
and
one
of
us
would
have
fallen
i
did
not
care
which
you
or
elwood
or
myself
but
he
is
not
here
and
the
cast
of
the
die
is
between
us
two
unless
you
wish
a
certainty
carmel
in
which
case
i
will
pour
out
but
one
glass
and
drink
that
myself
she
was
in
a
fever
now
and
desperate
death
was
in
the
room
i
felt
it
in
my
lifted
hair
and
in
her
strangely
drawn
face
if
i
screamed
who
would
hear
me
i
never
thought
of
the
telephone
and
i
doubt
if
she
would
have
let
me
use
it
then
the
power
she
had
always
exerted
over
me
was
very
strong
in
her
at
this
moment
and
not
till
afterwards
did
it
cross
my
mind
that
i
had
never
asked
her
how
she
got
to
the
house
or
whether
we
were
as
much
alone
in
the
building
as
i
believed
i
drink
alone
she
repeated
and
i
cried
out
at
which
her
hand
went
to
her
breast
as
i
had
so
long
expected
and
i
saw
the
glitter
of
a
little
phial
as
she
drew
it
forth
adelaide
i
began
but
she
heeded
me
no
more
than
the
dead
on
leaving
home
she
had
put
on
a
long
coat
with
pockets
and
this
coat
was
still
on
her
and
the
pockets
gaping
thrusting
her
other
hand
into
one
of
these
she
drew
out
a
little
flask
covered
with
wicker
and
set
it
on
a
stand
beside
her
then
she
pulled
out
two
small
glasses
and
set
them
down
also
and
then
she
turned
her
back
i
could
hear
the
drop
drop
of
the
liquor
and
dark
as
the
room
was
it
seemed
to
turn
darker
till
i
put
out
my
hands
like
one
groping
in
a
sudden
night
but
everything
cleared
before
me
when
she
turned
around
again
features
set
like
hers
force
themselves
to
be
seen
she
advanced
a
glass
in
either
hand
as
she
came
the
floor
swayed
and
the
walls
seemed
to
bow
together
but
they
did
not
sway
her
step
by
step
she
drew
near
and
when
she
reached
my
side
she
smiled
in
my
face
once
then
she
said
aright
dear
heart
leave
the
poisoned
one
for
me
fascinated
i
stared
at
one
glass
then
at
the
other
had
either
of
her
hands
trembled
i
should
have
grasped
at
the
glass
it
held
but
not
a
tremor
shook
those
icy
fingers
nor
did
her
eyes
wander
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
i
shrieked
out
them
behind
you
let
us
live
live
but
she
only
reiterated
that
awful
word
and
i
dare
not
hesitate
longer
lest
i
lose
my
chance
to
save
her
groping
i
touched
a
glass
i
never
knew
which
one
and
drawing
it
from
her
fingers
i
lifted
it
to
my
mouth
instantly
her
other
hand
rose
do
know
which
is
which
myself
she
said
and
drank
that
made
me
drink
also
the
two
glasses
sent
out
a
clicking
sound
as
we
set
them
back
on
the
stand
then
we
waited
looking
at
each
other
her
lips
seemed
to
say
in
another
moment
we
knew
choice
was
the
right
one
said
she
and
she
sank
back
into
a
chair
leave
me
she
called
out
for
i
was
about
to
run
shrieking
out
into
the
night
i
am
happy
now
that
it
is
all
settled
but
i
do
not
want
to
die
alone
oh
how
hot
i
am
and
leaping
up
she
flung
off
her
coat
and
went
gasping
about
the
room
for
air
when
she
sank
down
again
it
was
on
the
lounge
and
again
i
tried
to
fly
for
help
and
again
she
would
not
let
me
suddenly
she
started
up
and
i
saw
a
great
change
in
her
the
heavy
leaden
look
was
gone
tenderness
had
come
back
to
her
eyes
and
a
human
anxious
expression
to
her
whole
face
have
been
mad
she
cried
carmel
what
have
i
done
to
you
my
more
than
sister
my
child
my
child
i
tried
to
soothe
her
to
keep
down
my
awful
fear
and
soothe
her
but
the
nearness
of
death
had
calmed
her
poor
heart
into
its
old
love
and
habitual
thoughtfulness
she
was
terrified
at
my
position
she
recalled
our
mother
and
the
oath
she
had
taken
at
that
mother
to
protect
me
and
care
for
me
and
my
brother
i
have
failed
to
do
either
she
cried
i
have
alienated
and
you
i
am
leaving
to
unknown
trouble
and
danger
she
was
not
to
be
comforted
i
saw
her
life
ebbing
and
could
do
nothing
she
clung
to
me
while
she
called
up
all
her
powers
and
made
plans
for
me
and
showed
me
a
way
of
escape
i
was
to
burn
the
note
fling
two
of
the
glasses
from
the
window
and
leave
the
other
and
the
deadly
phial
near
her
hand
this
before
i
left
the
room
then
i
was
to
call
up
the
police
and
say
there
was
something
wrong
at
the
but
i
was
not
to
give
my
name
or
ever
acknowledge
i
was
there
can
save
trouble
she
said
that
trouble
must
not
come
near
you
swear
that
you
will
heed
my
words
swear
that
you
will
do
what
i
say
i
swore
all
that
she
asked
i
promised
i
was
almost
dying
too
and
had
the
light
gone
out
and
the
rafters
of
the
house
fallen
in
and
buried
us
both
it
would
have
been
better
but
the
light
burned
on
and
the
life
in
her
eyes
faded
out
and
the
hands
grasping
mine
relaxed
i
heard
one
little
gasp
then
a
low
prayer
arthur
never
never
again
to
then
silence
sobs
cries
veiled
faces
then
silence
in
the
courtroom
too
it
was
broken
but
by
one
sound
a
heartrending
sigh
from
the
prisoner
but
nobody
looked
at
him
and
thank
god
nobody
looked
at
me
every
eye
was
on
the
face
of
this
young
girl
whose
story
bore
such
an
impress
of
truth
and
yet
was
so
contradictory
of
all
former
evidence
what
revelations
were
yet
to
follow
it
would
seem
that
she
was
speaking
of
her
sister
death
but
her
sister
had
not
died
that
way
her
sister
had
been
strangled
could
this
dainty
creature
with
beauty
scarred
and
yet
powerfully
triumphant
be
the
victim
of
an
hallucination
as
to
the
cause
of
that
scar
and
the
awesome
circumstances
which
attended
its
infliction
or
harder
still
to
believe
were
these
tones
these
evidences
of
grief
this
pathetic
yielding
to
the
rights
of
the
law
in
face
of
the
heart
natural
shrinking
from
disclosures
sacred
as
they
were
tragic
were
these
the
medium
by
which
she
sought
to
mislead
justice
and
to
conceal
truth
even
i
with
my
memory
of
her
looks
as
she
faltered
down
the
staircase
on
that
memorable
night
pale
staring
her
left
hand
to
her
cheek
and
rocking
from
side
to
side
in
pain
or
terror
could
not
but
ask
if
this
story
did
not
involve
a
still
more
terrible
sequel
i
searched
her
face
and
racked
my
very
soul
in
my
effort
to
discern
what
lay
beneath
this
angelic
surface
beneath
this
recital
which
if
it
were
true
and
the
whole
truth
would
call
not
only
for
the
devotion
of
a
lifetime
but
a
respect
transcending
love
and
elevating
it
to
worship
but
in
her
cold
and
quiet
features
i
could
detect
nothing
beyond
the
melancholy
of
grief
and
the
suspense
from
which
all
suffered
kept
me
also
on
the
rack
until
at
a
question
from
moffat
she
spoke
again
and
we
heard
her
say
yes
she
died
that
way
with
her
hands
in
mine
there
was
no
one
else
by
we
were
quite
alone
that
settled
it
and
for
a
moment
the
revulsion
of
feeling
threatened
to
throw
the
court
into
tumult
but
one
thing
restrained
them
not
the
look
of
astonishment
on
her
face
not
the
startled
uplift
of
head
not
the
quiet
complacency
which
in
an
instant
replaced
the
defeated
aspect
of
the
district
attorney
but
the
gesture
and
attitude
of
moffat
the
man
who
had
put
her
on
the
stand
and
who
now
from
the
very
force
of
his
personality
kept
the
storm
in
abeyance
and
by
his
own
composure
forced
back
attention
to
his
witness
and
to
his
own
confidence
in
his
case
this
result
reached
he
turned
again
towards
carmel
with
renewed
respect
in
his
manner
and
a
marked
softening
in
his
aspect
and
voice
can
you
fix
the
hour
of
this
occurrence
he
asked
in
any
way
can
you
locate
the
time
no
for
i
did
not
move
at
once
i
felt
tied
to
that
couch
i
am
very
young
and
i
had
never
seen
death
before
when
i
did
get
up
i
hobbled
like
an
old
woman
and
almost
went
distracted
but
came
to
myself
as
i
saw
the
note
on
the
floor
the
note
i
was
told
to
burn
lifting
it
i
moved
towards
the
fireplace
but
got
a
fright
on
the
way
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
looked
back
i
thought
i
had
heard
my
sister
speak
but
the
fancy
passed
as
i
saw
how
still
she
lay
and
i
went
on
after
a
while
and
threw
the
note
into
the
one
small
flame
which
was
all
that
was
left
of
the
fire
i
saw
it
caught
by
a
draught
from
the
door
behind
me
and
go
flaming
up
the
chimney
some
of
my
trouble
seemed
to
go
with
it
but
a
great
one
yet
remained
i
did
know
how
i
could
ever
turn
around
again
and
see
my
sister
lying
there
behind
me
with
her
face
fixed
in
death
for
which
i
was
in
a
way
responsible
i
was
abjectly
frightened
and
knelt
there
a
long
time
praying
and
shuddering
before
i
could
rise
again
to
my
feet
and
move
about
as
i
had
to
since
god
had
not
stricken
me
and
i
must
live
my
life
and
do
what
my
sister
had
bidden
me
courage
such
courage
as
i
had
had
was
all
gone
from
me
now
and
while
i
knew
there
was
something
else
for
me
to
do
before
i
left
the
room
i
could
not
remember
what
it
was
and
stood
hesitating
dreading
to
lift
my
eyes
and
yet
feeling
that
i
ought
to
if
only
to
aid
my
memory
by
a
look
at
my
sister
face
suddenly
i
did
look
up
but
it
did
not
aid
my
memory
and
realising
that
i
could
never
think
with
that
lifeless
figure
before
me
i
lifted
a
pillow
from
the
near
by
and
covered
her
face
i
must
have
done
more
i
must
have
covered
the
whole
lounge
with
pillows
and
cushions
for
presently
my
mind
cleared
again
and
i
recollected
that
it
was
something
about
the
poison
i
was
to
put
the
phial
in
her
hand
or
was
i
to
throw
it
from
the
window
something
was
to
be
thrown
from
the
window
it
must
be
the
phial
but
i
could
lift
the
window
so
having
found
the
phial
standing
on
the
table
beside
the
little
flask
i
carried
it
into
the
closet
where
there
was
a
window
opening
inward
and
i
dropped
it
out
of
that
and
thought
i
had
done
all
but
when
i
came
back
and
saw
adelaide
coat
lying
in
a
heap
where
she
had
thrown
it
i
recalled
that
she
had
said
something
about
this
but
what
i
know
so
i
lifted
it
and
put
it
in
the
closet
why
i
can
not
say
then
i
set
my
mind
on
going
home
but
there
was
something
to
do
first
something
not
in
that
room
it
was
a
long
time
before
it
came
to
me
then
the
sight
of
the
empty
hall
recalled
it
the
door
by
which
adelaide
had
come
in
had
never
been
closed
and
as
i
went
towards
it
i
remembered
the
telephone
and
that
i
was
to
call
up
the
police
lifting
the
candle
i
went
creeping
towards
the
front
hall
adelaide
had
commanded
me
or
i
could
never
have
accomplished
this
task
i
had
to
open
a
door
and
when
it
swung
to
behind
me
and
latched
i
turned
around
and
looked
at
it
as
if
i
never
expected
it
to
open
again
i
almost
think
i
fainted
if
one
can
faint
standing
for
when
i
knew
anything
after
the
appalling
latching
of
that
door
i
was
in
quite
another
part
of
the
room
and
the
candle
which
i
still
held
looked
to
my
dazed
eyes
shorter
than
when
i
started
with
it
from
the
place
where
my
sister
lay
i
was
wasting
time
the
thought
drove
me
to
the
table
i
caught
up
the
receiver
and
when
central
answered
i
said
something
about
the
whispering
pines
and
wanting
help
this
is
all
i
remember
about
that
some
time
afterward
i
do
know
when
i
was
stumbling
down
the
stairs
on
my
way
out
i
had
gone
to
to
the
room
again
for
my
little
bag
for
the
keys
were
in
it
and
i
dared
not
leave
them
but
i
did
stay
a
minute
and
i
cast
but
one
glance
at
the
lounge
what
happened
afterward
is
like
a
dream
to
me
i
found
the
horse
the
horse
found
the
road
and
some
time
later
i
reached
home
as
i
came
within
sight
of
the
house
i
grew
suddenly
strong
again
the
open
stable
door
reminded
me
of
my
duty
and
driving
in
i
quickly
unharnessed
jenny
and
put
her
away
then
i
dragged
the
cutter
into
place
and
hung
up
the
harness
lastly
i
locked
the
door
and
carried
the
key
with
me
into
the
house
and
hung
it
up
on
its
usual
nail
in
the
kitchen
i
had
obeyed
adelaide
and
now
i
would
go
to
my
room
that
is
what
she
would
wish
but
i
do
know
whether
i
did
this
or
not
my
mind
was
full
of
adelaide
till
confusion
came
then
darkness
and
then
a
perfect
blank
she
had
finished
she
had
done
as
she
had
been
asked
she
had
told
the
story
of
that
evening
as
she
knew
it
from
the
family
dinner
till
her
return
home
after
midnight
and
the
mystery
of
adelaide
death
was
as
great
as
ever
did
she
realise
this
had
i
wronged
this
lovely
tempestuous
nature
by
suspicions
which
this
story
put
to
blush
i
was
happy
to
think
so
madly
unreasonably
happy
whatever
happened
whatever
the
future
threatening
arthur
or
myself
it
was
rapture
to
be
restored
to
right
thinking
as
regards
this
captivating
and
youthful
spirit
who
had
suffered
and
must
suffer
always
and
all
through
me
who
thought
it
a
pleasant
pastime
to
play
with
hearts
and
awoke
to
find
i
was
playing
with
souls
and
those
of
the
two
noblest
women
i
had
ever
known
the
cutting
in
of
some
half
dozen
questions
from
moffat
which
i
scarcely
heard
and
which
did
not
at
all
affect
the
status
of
the
case
as
it
now
stood
served
to
cool
down
the
emotional
element
which
had
almost
superseded
the
judicial
in
more
minds
than
those
of
the
jury
and
having
thus
prepared
his
witness
for
an
examination
at
other
and
less
careful
hands
he
testified
his
satisfaction
at
her
replies
and
turned
her
over
to
the
prosecution
with
the
phrase
district
attorney
the
witness
is
yours
fox
at
once
arose
the
moment
was
ripe
for
conquest
he
put
his
most
vital
question
first
in
all
this
interview
with
your
sister
did
you
remark
any
discoloration
on
her
throat
the
witness
lips
opened
surprise
spoke
from
her
every
feature
discoloration
she
repeated
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
any
marks
darker
than
the
rest
of
her
skin
on
her
throat
or
neck
no
adelaide
had
a
spotless
skin
it
looked
like
marble
as
she
lay
there
no
i
saw
no
marks
miss
cumberland
have
you
heard
or
read
a
full
account
of
this
trial
she
was
trembling
now
was
it
from
fear
of
the
truth
or
under
that
terror
of
the
unknown
embodied
in
this
question
i
do
not
know
said
she
what
i
heard
was
from
my
nurse
and
moffat
i
read
very
little
and
that
was
only
about
the
first
days
of
the
trial
and
the
swearing
in
of
jurors
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
any
mention
made
of
marks
and
i
do
not
understand
yet
what
you
allude
to
district
attorney
fox
cast
at
moffat
an
eloquent
glance
which
that
gentleman
bore
unmoved
then
turning
back
to
the
witness
he
addressed
her
in
milder
and
more
considerate
tones
than
were
usually
heard
from
him
in
and
asked
did
you
hold
your
sister
hands
all
the
time
she
lay
dying
as
you
thought
on
the
lounge
yes
yes
and
did
not
see
her
raise
them
once
no
no
how
was
it
when
you
let
go
of
them
where
did
they
fall
then
on
her
breast
i
laid
them
down
softly
and
crossed
them
i
did
not
leave
her
till
i
had
done
this
and
closed
her
eyes
and
what
did
you
do
then
i
went
for
the
note
to
burn
it
miss
cumberland
in
your
direct
examination
you
said
that
you
stopped
still
as
you
crossed
the
floor
at
the
time
thinking
that
your
sister
called
and
that
you
looked
back
at
her
to
see
yes
sir
were
her
hands
crossed
then
yes
sir
just
the
same
and
afterward
when
you
came
from
the
fire
after
waiting
some
little
time
for
courage
yes
yes
there
were
no
signs
of
movement
oh
she
was
dead
quite
dead
no
statements
miss
cumberland
she
looked
the
same
and
you
saw
no
change
in
the
position
of
her
hands
none
they
were
just
as
i
left
them
miss
cumberland
you
have
told
us
how
immediately
after
taking
the
poison
she
staggered
about
the
room
and
sank
first
on
a
chair
and
then
on
the
lounge
were
you
watching
her
then
oh
yes
every
moment
her
hands
as
well
as
her
face
i
do
know
about
her
hands
i
should
have
observed
it
if
she
had
done
anything
strange
with
them
can
you
say
she
did
not
clutch
or
grip
her
throat
during
any
of
this
time
yes
yes
i
could
have
forgotten
it
if
she
had
done
that
i
remember
every
move
she
made
so
well
she
did
do
that
fox
eye
stole
towards
the
jury
to
a
man
they
were
alert
anxious
for
the
next
question
and
serious
as
the
arbitrators
of
a
man
life
ought
to
be
satisfied
he
put
the
question
when
after
telephoning
you
returned
to
the
room
where
your
sister
lay
you
glanced
at
the
lounge
yes
i
could
not
help
it
was
it
in
the
same
condition
as
when
you
left
the
pillows
i
mean
i
i
think
so
i
can
not
say
i
only
half
looked
i
was
terrified
by
it
can
you
say
they
had
not
been
disturbed
no
i
can
say
nothing
but
what
does
only
the
answer
miss
cumberland
can
you
tell
us
how
those
pillows
were
arranged
i
afraid
not
i
threw
them
down
quickly
madly
just
as
i
collected
them
i
only
know
that
i
put
the
window
cushion
down
first
the
rest
fell
anyhow
but
they
quite
covered
her
quite
hands
and
face
her
whole
body
and
did
they
cover
her
quite
when
you
came
back
they
must
have
wait
wait
i
know
i
have
no
right
to
say
that
but
i
can
not
swear
that
i
saw
any
change
can
you
swear
that
there
was
no
change
that
the
pillows
and
the
window
cushion
lay
just
as
they
did
when
you
left
the
room
she
did
not
answer
horror
seemed
to
have
seized
hold
of
her
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
attorney
face
wavered
and
had
they
followed
their
natural
impulse
would
have
turned
towards
her
brother
but
her
fear
possibly
her
love
was
her
counsellor
and
she
brought
them
back
to
fox
resolutely
but
with
a
shuddering
insight
of
the
importance
of
her
reply
she
answered
with
that
one
weighty
monosyllable
which
can
crush
so
many
hopes
and
even
wreck
a
life
no
at
the
next
moment
she
was
in
carpenter
arms
her
strength
had
given
way
for
the
time
and
the
court
was
hastily
adjourned
to
give
her
opportunity
for
rest
and
recuperation
xxxi
were
her
hands
crossed
then
threescore
and
ten
i
can
remember
well
within
the
volume
of
which
time
i
have
seen
hours
dreadful
and
things
strange
but
this
sore
night
hath
trifled
former
knowledge
i
shall
say
nothing
about
myself
at
this
juncture
that
will
come
later
i
have
something
of
quite
different
purport
to
relate
when
i
left
the
with
the
other
witnesses
i
noticed
a
man
standing
near
the
district
attorney
he
was
a
very
plain
man
with
no
especial
claims
to
attention
that
i
could
see
yet
i
looked
at
him
longer
than
i
did
at
any
one
else
and
turned
and
looked
at
him
again
as
i
passed
through
the
doorway
afterward
i
heard
that
he
was
sweetwater
the
detective
from
new
york
who
had
had
so
much
to
do
in
unearthing
the
testimony
against
arthur
testimony
which
in
the
light
of
this
morning
revelations
had
taken
on
quite
a
new
aspect
as
he
was
doubtless
the
first
to
acknowledge
it
was
the
curious
blending
of
professional
disappointment
and
a
personal
and
characteristic
appreciation
of
the
surprising
situation
which
made
me
observe
him
i
suppose
certainly
my
heart
and
mind
were
full
enough
not
to
waste
looks
on
a
commonplace
stranger
unless
there
had
been
some
such
overpowering
reason
i
left
him
still
talking
to
fox
and
later
received
this
account
of
the
interview
which
followed
between
them
and
perry
is
this
girl
telling
the
truth
asked
district
attorney
fox
as
soon
as
the
three
were
closeted
and
each
could
speak
his
own
mind
doctor
what
do
you
think
i
do
not
question
her
veracity
in
the
least
a
woman
who
for
purely
moral
reasons
could
defy
pain
and
risk
the
loss
of
a
beauty
universally
acknowledged
as
transcendent
would
never
stoop
to
falsehood
even
in
her
desire
to
save
a
brother
life
i
have
every
confidence
in
her
fox
and
i
think
you
may
safely
have
the
same
you
believe
that
she
burnt
herself
intentionally
i
would
disbelieve
it
you
may
think
me
sentimental
i
knew
and
loved
her
father
for
any
fortune
you
might
name
say
that
you
never
knew
her
father
say
that
you
had
no
more
interest
in
the
girl
or
the
case
than
the
jurors
have
what
then
i
should
believe
her
for
humanity
sake
for
the
sake
of
the
happiness
it
gives
one
to
find
something
true
and
strong
in
this
sordid
world
a
jewel
in
a
oh
i
a
sentimentalist
i
acknowledge
fox
turned
to
sweetwater
and
you
fox
have
you
those
tongs
yes
i
forgot
they
were
brought
to
my
office
with
the
other
exhibits
i
attached
no
importance
to
them
and
you
will
probably
find
them
just
where
i
thrust
them
into
the
box
marked
they
were
in
the
district
attorney
office
and
sweetwater
at
once
rose
and
brought
forward
the
tongs
there
is
my
answer
he
said
pointing
significantly
at
one
of
the
legs
the
district
attorney
turned
pale
and
motioned
sweetwater
to
carry
them
back
he
sat
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
showed
that
he
was
a
man
miss
cumberland
has
my
respect
said
he
sweetwater
came
back
to
his
place
perry
waited
finally
fox
turned
to
him
and
put
the
anticipated
question
you
are
satisfied
with
your
autopsy
miss
cumberland
death
was
due
to
strangulation
and
not
to
the
poison
she
took
that
was
what
i
swore
to
and
what
i
should
have
to
swear
to
again
if
you
placed
me
back
on
the
stand
the
poison
taken
with
her
great
excitement
robbed
her
of
consciousness
but
there
was
too
little
of
it
or
it
was
too
old
and
weakened
to
cause
death
she
would
probably
have
revived
in
time
possibly
did
revive
but
the
clutch
of
those
fingers
was
fatal
she
could
not
survive
it
it
costs
me
more
than
you
can
ever
understand
to
say
this
but
questions
like
yours
must
be
answered
i
should
not
be
an
honest
man
otherwise
sweetwater
made
a
movement
fox
turned
and
looked
at
him
critically
speak
out
said
he
but
sweetwater
had
nothing
to
say
neither
had
perry
the
oppression
of
an
unsolved
problem
involving
lives
of
whose
value
each
formed
a
different
estimate
was
upon
them
all
possibly
heaviest
upon
the
district
attorney
the
most
serious
portion
of
whose
work
lay
still
before
him
to
the
relief
of
all
carmel
was
physically
stronger
than
we
expected
when
she
came
to
retake
the
stand
in
the
afternoon
but
she
had
lost
a
little
of
her
courage
her
expectation
of
clearing
her
brother
at
a
word
had
left
her
and
with
it
the
excitation
of
hope
yet
she
made
a
noble
picture
as
she
sat
there
meeting
without
a
blush
but
with
an
air
of
sweet
humility
impossible
to
describe
the
curious
glances
of
the
multitude
some
of
them
anxious
to
repeat
the
experience
of
the
morning
some
of
them
new
to
the
court
to
her
and
the
cause
for
which
she
stood
fox
kept
nobody
waiting
with
a
gentleness
such
as
he
seldom
showed
to
any
witness
for
the
defence
he
resumed
his
by
propounding
the
following
question
miss
cumberland
in
your
account
of
the
final
interview
you
had
with
your
sister
you
alluded
to
a
story
you
had
once
read
together
will
you
tell
us
the
name
of
this
story
it
was
called
legend
of
francis
the
first
it
was
not
a
novel
but
a
little
tale
she
found
in
some
old
magazine
it
had
a
great
effect
upon
us
i
have
never
forgotten
it
can
you
relate
this
tale
to
us
in
a
few
words
i
will
try
it
was
very
simple
it
merely
told
how
a
young
girl
marred
her
beauty
to
escape
the
attentions
of
the
great
king
and
what
respect
he
always
showed
her
after
that
even
calling
her
sister
was
the
thrill
in
her
voice
or
in
my
own
heart
or
in
the
story
emphasised
as
it
was
by
her
undeniable
attempt
upon
her
own
beauty
as
that
last
word
fell
so
softly
yet
with
such
tender
suggestion
a
sensation
of
sympathy
passed
between
us
for
the
first
time
and
i
knew
from
the
purity
of
her
look
and
the
fearlessness
of
this
covert
appeal
to
one
she
could
not
address
openly
that
the
doubts
i
had
cherished
of
her
up
to
this
very
moment
were
an
outrage
and
that
were
it
possible
or
seemly
i
should
be
bowed
down
in
the
dust
at
her
feet
in
reality
as
i
was
in
spirit
others
may
have
shared
my
feeling
for
the
glances
which
flew
from
her
face
to
mine
were
laden
with
an
appreciation
of
the
situation
which
for
the
moment
drove
the
prisoner
from
the
minds
of
all
and
centred
attention
on
this
tragedy
of
souls
bared
in
so
cruel
a
way
to
the
curiosity
of
the
crowd
i
could
not
bear
it
the
triumph
of
my
heart
battled
with
the
shame
of
my
fault
and
i
might
have
been
tempted
into
some
act
of
manifest
imprudence
if
fox
had
not
cut
my
misery
short
by
recalling
attention
to
the
witness
with
a
question
of
the
most
vital
importance
while
you
were
holding
your
sister
hands
in
what
you
supposed
to
be
her
final
moments
did
you
observe
whether
or
not
she
still
wore
on
her
finger
the
curious
ring
given
her
by
ranelagh
and
known
as
her
engagement
ring
yes
i
not
only
saw
it
but
felt
it
it
was
the
only
one
she
wore
on
her
left
hand
the
district
attorney
paused
this
was
an
admission
unexpected
perhaps
by
himself
which
it
was
desirable
to
have
sink
into
the
minds
of
the
jury
the
ring
had
not
been
removed
by
adelaide
herself
it
was
still
on
her
finger
as
the
last
hour
drew
nigh
an
awful
fact
if
established
telling
seriously
against
arthur
involuntarily
i
glanced
his
way
he
was
looking
at
me
the
mutual
glance
struck
fire
what
i
thought
he
thought
but
possibly
with
a
difference
the
moment
was
surcharged
with
emotion
for
all
but
the
witness
herself
she
was
calm
perhaps
she
did
not
understand
the
significance
of
the
occasion
fox
pressed
his
advantage
and
when
you
rose
from
the
lounge
and
crossed
your
sister
hands
it
was
still
there
i
put
that
hand
uppermost
and
left
the
ring
on
oh
yes
oh
yes
her
whole
attitude
and
face
were
full
of
protest
so
that
to
the
best
of
your
belief
it
was
still
on
your
finger
when
you
left
the
room
certainly
sir
certainly
there
was
alarm
in
her
tone
now
she
was
beginning
to
see
that
her
testimony
was
not
as
entirely
helpful
to
arthur
as
she
had
been
led
to
expect
in
her
helplessness
she
cast
a
glance
of
entreaty
at
her
brother
counsel
but
he
was
busily
occupied
with
pencil
and
paper
and
she
received
no
encouragement
unless
it
was
from
his
studiously
composed
manner
and
general
air
of
unconcern
she
did
not
know
nor
did
i
know
then
what
uneasiness
such
an
air
may
cover
fox
had
followed
her
glances
and
perhaps
understood
his
adversary
better
than
she
did
for
he
drew
himself
up
with
an
appearance
of
satisfaction
as
he
asked
very
quietly
what
material
did
you
use
in
lighting
the
fire
on
the
hearth
wood
from
the
box
and
a
little
kindling
i
found
there
how
large
was
this
kindling
not
very
large
some
few
stray
pieces
of
finer
wood
i
picked
out
from
she
rest
and
how
did
you
light
these
with
some
scraps
of
paper
i
brought
in
my
bag
oh
you
brought
scraps
yes
i
had
seen
the
box
seen
the
wood
but
knew
the
wood
would
not
kindle
without
paper
so
i
brought
some
did
the
fire
light
quickly
not
very
quickly
you
had
trouble
with
it
yes
sir
but
i
made
it
burn
at
last
are
you
in
the
habit
of
kindling
fires
in
your
own
home
yes
on
the
hearth
you
understand
them
i
have
always
found
it
a
very
simple
matter
if
you
have
paper
and
enough
kindling
and
the
draught
is
good
yes
sir
was
the
draught
good
at
the
not
at
first
oh
not
at
first
when
did
you
see
a
change
when
the
note
i
was
trying
to
burn
flew
up
the
chimney
i
see
was
that
after
or
before
the
door
opened
after
did
the
opening
of
this
door
alter
the
temperature
of
the
room
i
can
not
say
i
felt
neither
heat
nor
cold
at
any
time
did
you
feel
the
icy
cold
when
you
opened
the
window
to
throw
out
the
phial
i
do
remember
would
you
remember
if
you
had
i
can
not
say
can
you
say
whether
you
noticed
any
especial
chill
in
the
hall
when
you
went
out
to
telephone
my
teeth
were
chattering
but
had
they
chattered
before
they
may
have
i
only
noticed
it
then
but
the
facts
miss
cumberland
your
teeth
chattered
while
you
were
passing
through
the
hall
did
this
keep
up
after
you
entered
the
room
where
you
found
the
telephone
i
do
remember
i
was
almost
insensible
you
do
remember
that
they
did
no
sir
but
you
do
remember
having
shut
the
door
behind
you
yes
an
open
window
in
the
hall
that
was
what
he
was
trying
to
prove
open
at
this
time
from
the
expression
of
such
faces
of
the
jury
as
i
could
see
i
think
he
had
proved
it
the
next
point
he
made
was
in
the
same
line
had
she
in
all
the
time
she
was
in
the
building
heard
any
noises
she
could
not
account
for
yes
many
times
can
you
describe
these
noises
no
they
were
of
all
kinds
the
pines
sighed
continually
i
knew
it
was
the
pines
but
i
had
to
listen
once
i
heard
a
rushing
sound
it
was
when
the
pines
stopped
swaying
for
an
instant
but
i
do
know
what
it
was
it
was
all
very
dreadful
was
this
rushing
sound
such
as
a
window
might
make
on
being
opened
possibly
i
did
think
of
it
at
the
time
but
it
might
have
been
from
what
direction
did
it
come
back
of
me
for
i
turned
my
head
about
where
were
you
at
the
time
at
the
hearth
it
was
before
adelaide
came
in
a
near
sound
or
a
far
far
but
i
can
not
locate
it
indeed
i
can
not
i
forgot
it
in
a
moment
but
you
remember
it
now
yes
and
can
not
you
remember
any
other
noises
than
those
you
speak
of
that
time
you
stepped
into
the
hall
when
your
teeth
chattered
you
know
did
you
hear
nothing
then
but
the
sighing
of
the
pines
she
looked
startled
her
hands
went
up
and
one
of
them
clutched
at
her
throat
then
they
fell
and
slowly
carefully
like
one
feeling
his
way
she
answered
i
had
forgotten
i
did
hear
something
a
sound
in
one
of
the
doorways
it
was
very
faint
a
sigh
a
a
i
do
know
what
it
conveyed
nothing
to
me
then
and
not
much
now
but
you
asked
and
i
have
answered
you
have
done
right
miss
cumberland
the
jury
ought
to
know
these
facts
was
it
a
human
sigh
it
was
the
sigh
of
the
pines
and
you
heard
it
in
one
of
the
doorways
which
doorway
the
one
opposite
the
room
in
which
i
left
my
sister
the
doorway
to
the
large
hall
yes
sir
oh
the
sinister
memories
the
moments
which
i
myself
had
spent
there
after
this
time
of
her
passing
through
the
hall
thank
god
but
not
long
after
and
some
one
had
been
there
before
me
was
it
arthur
i
hardly
had
the
courage
to
interrogate
his
face
but
when
i
did
i
like
every
one
else
who
looked
that
way
met
nothing
but
the
quietude
of
a
fully
composed
man
there
was
nothing
to
be
learned
from
him
now
the
hour
for
was
past
i
began
to
have
a
hideous
doubt
carmel
being
innocent
who
could
be
guilty
but
he
i
knew
of
no
one
the
misery
under
which
i
had
suffered
was
only
lightened
not
removed
we
were
still
to
see
evil
days
the
prosecution
would
prove
its
case
and
but
there
was
moffat
i
must
not
reckon
without
moffat
he
had
sprung
one
surprise
was
he
not
capable
of
springing
another
relieved
i
fixed
my
mind
again
upon
the
proceedings
what
was
fox
asking
her
now
miss
cumberland
are
you
ready
to
swear
that
you
did
not
hear
a
step
at
that
time
yes
sir
or
see
a
face
yes
sir
that
you
only
heard
a
sigh
a
sigh
or
something
like
one
which
made
you
stop
no
i
did
not
stop
you
went
right
on
immediately
entering
the
telephone
room
yes
the
door
of
which
you
shut
yes
intentionally
no
not
intentionally
did
you
shut
that
door
yourself
i
do
not
know
i
must
have
but
i
never
mind
explanations
you
do
not
know
whether
you
shut
it
or
whether
some
one
else
shut
it
i
do
not
the
words
fell
weightily
they
seemed
to
strike
every
heart
miss
cumberland
you
have
said
that
you
telephoned
for
the
police
i
telephoned
to
central
for
help
yes
for
help
you
were
some
minutes
doing
this
you
say
i
have
reason
to
think
so
but
i
do
know
definitely
the
candle
seemed
shorter
when
i
went
out
than
when
i
came
in
are
you
sure
you
telephoned
for
help
help
was
what
i
wanted
help
for
my
sister
i
do
not
remember
my
words
and
then
you
left
the
building
after
going
for
my
little
bag
did
you
see
any
one
then
no
sir
hear
any
one
no
sir
did
you
see
your
sister
again
i
have
said
that
i
just
glanced
at
the
couch
were
the
pillows
there
yes
sir
just
as
you
had
left
them
i
have
said
that
i
could
not
tell
would
you
know
if
they
had
been
disturbed
no
sir
not
from
the
look
i
gave
them
then
they
might
have
been
disturbed
might
even
have
been
rearranged
your
knowing
it
they
might
miss
cumberland
when
you
left
the
building
did
you
leave
it
alone
i
did
was
the
moon
shining
no
it
was
snowing
did
the
moon
shine
when
you
went
to
throw
the
phial
out
of
the
window
yes
very
brightly
bright
enough
for
you
to
see
the
links
i
did
look
at
the
links
where
were
you
looking
behind
me
when
you
threw
the
phial
out
yes
what
was
there
behind
you
a
dead
sister
oh
the
indescribable
tone
nothing
else
no
forgive
me
miss
cumberland
i
do
not
want
to
trouble
you
but
was
there
not
something
or
some
one
in
the
adjoining
room
besides
your
dead
sister
to
make
you
look
back
i
saw
no
one
but
i
looked
back
i
do
not
know
why
and
did
you
turn
at
all
i
do
not
think
so
you
threw
the
phial
out
without
looking
yes
how
do
you
know
you
threw
it
out
i
felt
it
slip
from
my
hand
where
over
the
window
ledge
i
had
pulled
the
window
open
before
i
turned
my
head
i
had
only
to
feel
for
the
sill
when
i
touched
its
edge
i
opened
my
fingers
triumph
for
the
defence
on
this
point
had
only
served
to
elucidate
a
mysterious
fact
the
position
of
the
phial
caught
in
the
vines
was
accounted
for
in
a
very
natural
manner
fox
shifted
his
inquiries
you
have
said
that
you
wore
a
hat
and
coat
of
your
brother
in
coming
to
the
did
you
keep
these
articles
on
no
i
left
them
in
the
lower
hall
where
in
the
lower
hall
on
the
rack
there
was
your
candle
lit
not
then
sir
yet
you
found
the
rack
i
felt
for
it
i
knew
where
it
was
when
did
you
light
the
candle
after
i
hung
up
the
coat
and
when
you
came
down
did
you
have
the
candle
then
yes
for
a
while
but
i
did
have
any
light
when
i
went
for
the
coat
and
hat
i
remember
feeling
all
along
the
wall
i
do
know
what
i
did
with
the
candlestick
or
the
candle
i
had
them
on
the
stairs
i
have
them
when
i
put
on
the
coat
and
hat
i
knew
what
she
did
with
them
she
flung
them
out
of
her
hand
upon
the
marble
floor
should
i
ever
forget
the
darkness
swallowing
up
that
face
of
mental
horror
and
physical
suffering
miss
cumberland
you
are
sure
about
having
telephoned
for
help
and
that
you
mentioned
the
whispering
pines
in
doing
so
quite
sure
oh
what
weariness
was
creeping
into
her
voice
then
of
course
you
left
the
door
unlocked
when
you
went
out
of
the
building
no
no
i
did
i
had
the
key
and
i
locked
it
but
i
did
realise
this
till
i
went
to
untie
my
horse
then
i
found
the
keys
in
my
hand
but
i
did
go
back
do
you
mean
that
you
did
know
you
locked
the
door
i
do
remember
whether
i
knew
or
not
at
the
time
i
do
remember
being
surprised
and
a
little
frightened
when
i
saw
the
keys
but
i
did
go
back
yet
you
had
telephoned
for
the
police
yes
and
then
locked
them
out
i
did
care
i
did
care
an
infinite
number
of
questions
followed
the
poor
child
was
near
fainting
but
bore
up
wonderfully
notwithstanding
contradicting
herself
but
seldom
and
then
only
from
lack
of
understanding
the
question
or
from
sheer
fatigue
fox
was
considerate
and
moffat
interrupted
but
seldom
all
could
see
that
this
girl
this
heroine
of
all
hearts
was
trying
to
tell
the
truth
and
sympathy
was
with
her
even
that
of
the
prosecution
but
certain
facts
had
to
be
brought
out
among
them
the
blowing
off
of
her
hat
on
that
hurried
drive
home
through
the
ever
thickening
a
fact
easily
accounted
for
when
one
considered
the
thick
coils
of
hair
over
which
it
had
been
drawn
the
circumstances
connected
with
her
arrival
at
the
house
were
all
carefully
sifted
but
nothing
new
came
up
nor
was
her
credibility
as
a
witness
shaken
the
prosecution
had
lost
much
by
this
witness
but
it
had
also
gained
no
doubt
now
remained
that
the
ring
was
still
on
the
victim
hand
when
she
succumbed
to
the
effects
of
the
poison
and
the
possibility
of
another
presence
in
the
house
during
the
fateful
interview
just
recorded
had
been
strengthened
rather
than
lessened
by
carmel
s
hesitating
admissions
and
so
the
question
hung
poised
and
i
was
expecting
to
see
her
dismissed
from
the
stand
when
the
district
attorney
settled
himself
again
into
his
accustomed
attitude
of
inquiry
and
launched
this
new
question
when
you
went
into
the
stable
to
unharness
your
horse
what
did
you
do
with
the
little
bag
you
carried
i
took
it
out
of
the
cutter
what
then
set
it
down
somewhere
was
there
anything
in
the
bag
not
now
i
had
left
the
tongs
at
the
and
the
paper
i
had
burned
i
took
nothing
else
how
about
the
candlestick
that
i
carried
in
one
of
the
pockets
of
my
coat
that
i
left
too
was
that
all
you
carried
in
your
pockets
yes
the
candlestick
and
the
candle
the
candlestick
on
one
side
and
the
candle
on
the
other
and
these
you
did
not
have
on
your
return
no
i
left
both
so
that
your
pockets
were
empty
entirely
empty
when
you
drove
into
your
own
gate
yes
sir
so
far
as
i
know
i
never
looked
into
them
and
felt
nothing
there
no
sir
took
nothing
out
no
sir
then
or
when
you
unharnessed
your
horse
or
afterward
as
you
passed
back
to
the
house
no
sir
what
path
did
you
take
in
returning
to
the
house
there
is
only
one
did
you
walk
straight
through
it
as
straight
as
i
could
it
was
snowing
heavily
and
i
was
dizzy
and
felt
strange
i
may
have
zigzagged
a
little
did
you
zigzag
enough
to
go
back
of
the
stable
oh
no
you
are
sure
that
you
did
not
wander
in
back
of
the
stable
as
sure
as
i
can
be
of
anything
miss
cumberland
i
have
but
a
few
more
questions
to
ask
will
you
look
at
this
portion
of
a
broken
bottle
i
see
it
sir
will
you
take
it
in
your
hand
and
examine
it
carefully
she
reached
out
her
hand
it
was
trembling
visibly
and
her
face
expressed
a
deep
distress
but
she
took
the
piece
of
broken
bottle
and
looked
at
it
before
passing
it
back
miss
cumberland
did
you
ever
see
that
bit
of
broken
glass
before
she
shook
her
head
then
she
cast
a
quick
look
at
her
brother
and
seemed
to
gain
an
instantaneous
courage
no
said
she
i
may
have
seen
a
whole
bottle
like
that
at
some
time
in
the
but
i
have
no
memory
of
this
broken
end
none
at
all
i
am
obliged
to
you
miss
cumberland
i
will
trouble
you
no
more
then
he
threw
up
his
head
and
smiled
a
slow
sarcastic
smile
at
moffat
xxxii
and
i
had
said
nothing
o
my
soul
joy
if
after
every
tempest
come
such
calms
may
the
winds
blow
till
they
have
wakened
death
i
had
always
loved
her
that
i
knew
even
in
the
hour
of
my
darkest
suspicion
but
now
i
felt
free
to
worship
her
as
the
thought
penetrated
my
whole
being
it
made
the
night
gladsome
whatever
awaited
her
whatever
awaited
arthur
whatever
awaited
me
she
had
regenerated
me
a
change
took
place
that
night
in
my
whole
nature
in
my
aspect
of
life
and
my
view
of
women
one
fact
rode
triumphant
above
all
other
considerations
and
possible
distresses
fate
i
was
more
inclined
now
to
call
it
providence
had
shown
me
the
heart
of
a
great
and
true
woman
and
i
was
free
to
expend
all
my
best
impulses
in
honouring
her
and
loving
her
whether
she
ever
looked
my
way
again
received
or
even
acknowledged
a
homage
growing
out
of
such
wrong
as
i
had
done
her
and
her
unfortunate
sister
it
set
a
star
in
my
firmament
it
turned
down
all
the
and
besmirched
leaves
in
my
book
of
life
and
opened
up
a
new
page
on
which
her
name
written
in
letters
of
gold
demanded
clean
work
in
the
future
and
a
record
which
should
not
shame
the
aura
surrounding
that
pure
name
sorrow
for
the
past
dread
of
the
future
both
were
lost
in
the
glad
rebound
of
my
distracted
soul
the
night
was
dedicated
to
joy
and
to
joy
alone
the
next
day
being
sunday
i
had
ample
time
for
the
reaction
bound
to
follow
hours
of
such
exaltation
i
had
no
wish
for
company
i
even
denied
myself
to
clifton
the
sight
of
a
human
face
was
more
than
i
could
bear
unless
it
were
the
one
face
and
that
i
could
not
hope
for
but
the
desire
to
see
her
to
hear
from
her
if
only
to
learn
how
she
had
endured
the
bitter
ordeal
of
the
day
before
soon
became
unbearable
i
must
know
this
much
at
any
cost
to
her
feelings
or
to
mine
after
many
a
struggle
with
myself
i
called
up
carpenter
on
the
telephone
from
him
i
learned
that
she
was
physically
prostrated
but
still
clear
in
mind
and
satisfied
of
her
brother
innocence
this
latter
statement
might
mean
anything
but
imparted
by
him
to
me
it
seemed
to
be
capable
of
but
one
interpretation
i
must
be
prepared
for
whatever
distrust
of
myself
this
confidence
carried
with
it
this
was
intolerable
i
had
to
speak
i
had
to
inquire
if
she
had
yet
heard
the
real
reason
why
i
was
the
first
to
be
arrested
a
decided
no
cut
short
that
agony
i
could
breathe
again
and
proffer
a
humble
request
doctor
i
can
not
approach
her
i
can
not
even
write
it
would
seem
too
presumptuous
but
tell
her
as
you
find
the
opportunity
how
i
honour
her
do
not
let
her
remain
under
the
impression
that
i
am
not
capable
of
truly
feeling
what
she
has
borne
and
must
still
bear
i
will
do
what
i
can
was
his
reply
and
he
mercifully
cut
short
the
conversation
this
was
the
event
of
the
morning
in
the
afternoon
i
sat
in
my
window
thinking
my
powers
of
reasoning
had
returned
and
the
insoluble
problem
of
adelaide
murder
occupied
my
whole
mind
with
carmel
innocent
who
was
there
left
to
suspect
not
arthur
his
fingers
were
as
guiltless
as
my
own
of
those
marks
on
her
throat
of
this
i
was
convinced
difficult
as
it
made
my
future
my
mind
refused
to
see
guilt
in
a
man
who
could
meet
my
eye
with
just
the
look
he
gave
me
on
leaving
the
courtroom
at
the
conclusion
of
his
triumphant
examination
it
was
a
momentary
glance
but
i
read
it
i
am
sure
quite
truthfully
you
are
the
man
it
said
but
not
in
the
old
bitter
and
revengeful
way
voiced
by
his
tongue
before
we
came
together
in
the
one
effort
to
save
carmel
from
what
in
our
and
misunderstanding
of
her
character
we
had
looked
upon
as
the
worst
of
humiliations
and
the
most
desperate
of
perils
there
was
sadness
in
his
conviction
and
an
honest
man
regret
which
if
noted
by
those
about
us
was
far
more
dangerous
to
my
good
name
than
the
loudest
of
denunciations
or
the
most
acrimonious
of
assaults
it
put
me
in
the
worst
of
positions
but
one
chance
remained
for
me
now
the
secret
man
of
guilt
might
yet
come
to
light
but
how
or
through
whose
agency
i
found
myself
unable
to
conceive
i
had
neither
the
wit
nor
the
experience
to
untangle
this
confused
web
should
i
find
the
law
in
shape
to
deal
with
it
a
few
days
would
show
with
the
termination
of
trial
the
story
of
my
future
would
begin
meanwhile
i
must
have
patience
and
such
strength
as
could
be
got
from
the
present
and
so
the
afternoon
passed
with
the
coming
on
of
night
my
mood
changed
i
wanted
air
movement
the
closeness
of
my
rooms
had
become
unbearable
as
soon
as
the
lamps
were
lit
in
the
street
i
started
out
and
i
went
toward
the
cemetery
i
had
no
motive
in
choosing
this
direction
for
my
walk
the
road
was
an
open
one
and
i
should
neither
avoid
people
nor
escape
the
chilly
blast
blowing
directly
in
my
face
from
the
northeast
whim
or
shall
i
not
say
true
feeling
carried
me
there
though
i
was
quite
conscious
all
the
time
of
a
strong
desire
to
see
ella
fulton
and
learn
from
her
the
condition
of
affairs
whether
she
was
at
peace
or
in
utter
disgrace
with
her
parents
it
was
a
cold
night
as
i
have
said
and
there
were
but
few
people
in
the
streets
on
the
boulevard
i
met
nobody
as
i
neared
the
cemetery
i
passed
one
man
otherwise
i
was
to
all
appearance
alone
on
this
remote
avenue
the
effect
was
sinister
or
my
mood
made
it
so
yet
i
did
not
hasten
my
steps
the
hours
till
midnight
had
to
be
lived
through
in
some
way
and
why
not
in
this
no
companion
would
have
been
welcome
and
had
the
solitude
been
less
perfect
i
should
have
murmured
at
the
prospect
of
intrusion
the
cemetery
gates
were
shut
this
i
had
expected
but
i
did
not
need
to
enter
the
grounds
to
have
a
view
of
adelaide
grave
the
cumberland
lot
occupied
a
knoll
in
close
proximity
to
the
fence
and
my
only
intention
had
been
to
pass
this
spot
and
cast
one
look
within
in
memory
of
adelaide
to
reach
the
place
however
i
had
to
turn
a
corner
and
on
doing
so
i
saw
good
reason
as
i
thought
for
not
carrying
out
my
intention
at
this
especial
time
some
man
i
could
not
recognise
him
from
where
i
stood
had
forestalled
me
though
the
night
was
a
dark
one
sufficient
light
shone
from
the
scattered
lamps
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
for
me
to
discern
his
intent
figure
crouching
against
the
iron
bars
and
gazing
with
an
intentness
which
made
him
entirely
oblivious
of
my
presence
at
the
very
plot
and
on
the
very
grave
which
had
been
the
end
of
my
own
pilgrimage
so
motionless
he
stood
and
so
motionless
i
myself
became
at
this
unexpected
and
significant
sight
that
i
presently
imagined
i
could
hear
his
sighs
in
the
dread
quiet
into
which
the
whole
scene
had
sunk
grief
deeper
than
mine
spoke
in
those
labouring
breaths
adelaide
was
mourned
by
some
one
as
i
for
all
my
remorse
could
never
mourn
her
i
did
not
know
the
was
not
this
strange
enough
to
rouse
my
wonder
i
thought
so
and
was
on
the
point
of
satisfying
this
wonder
by
a
quick
advance
upon
this
stranger
when
there
happened
an
uncanny
thing
which
held
me
in
check
from
sheer
astonishment
i
was
so
placed
in
reference
to
one
of
the
street
lamps
i
have
already
mentioned
that
my
shadow
fell
before
me
plainly
along
the
snow
this
had
not
attracted
my
attention
until
at
the
point
of
moving
i
cast
my
eyes
down
and
saw
two
shadows
where
only
one
should
be
as
i
had
heard
no
one
behind
me
and
had
supposed
myself
entirely
alone
with
the
man
absorbed
in
contemplation
of
adelaide
grave
i
experienced
a
curious
sensation
which
without
being
fear
held
me
still
for
a
moment
with
my
eyes
on
this
second
shadow
it
did
not
move
any
more
than
mine
did
this
was
significant
and
i
turned
a
man
stood
at
my
back
not
looking
at
me
but
at
the
fellow
in
front
of
us
a
quiet
hush
sounded
in
my
ear
and
again
i
stood
still
but
only
for
an
instant
the
man
at
the
fence
aroused
by
my
movement
perhaps
had
turned
and
seeing
our
two
figures
started
to
fly
in
the
opposite
direction
instinctively
i
darted
forward
in
pursuit
but
was
soon
passed
by
the
man
behind
me
this
caused
me
to
slacken
for
i
had
recognised
this
latter
as
he
flew
by
as
sweetwater
the
detective
and
knew
that
he
would
do
this
work
better
than
myself
but
i
reckoned
without
my
host
he
went
only
as
far
as
the
spot
where
the
man
had
been
standing
when
in
my
astonishment
i
advanced
upon
him
there
he
wheeled
about
quite
naturally
in
my
direction
and
accosting
me
by
name
remarked
in
his
genial
manner
there
is
no
need
for
us
to
tire
our
legs
in
a
chase
after
that
man
i
know
him
well
enough
and
who
i
began
a
quizzical
smile
answered
me
the
light
was
now
in
our
faces
and
i
had
a
perfect
view
of
his
its
expression
quite
disarmed
me
but
i
knew
as
well
as
if
he
had
spoken
that
i
should
receive
no
other
reply
to
my
question
are
you
going
back
into
town
he
asked
as
i
paused
and
looked
down
at
the
umbrella
swinging
in
his
hand
i
was
sure
that
he
had
not
held
this
umbrella
when
he
started
by
me
on
the
run
if
so
will
you
allow
me
to
walk
beside
you
for
a
little
way
i
could
not
refuse
him
besides
i
was
not
sure
that
i
wanted
to
homely
as
any
man
i
had
ever
seen
there
was
a
magnetic
quality
in
his
voice
and
manner
that
affected
even
one
so
fastidious
as
myself
i
felt
that
i
had
rather
talk
to
him
at
that
moment
than
to
any
other
person
i
knew
of
course
curiosity
had
something
to
do
with
it
and
that
community
of
interest
which
is
the
strongest
bond
that
can
link
two
people
together
you
are
quite
welcome
said
i
and
again
cast
my
eye
at
the
umbrella
you
are
wondering
where
i
got
this
he
remarked
looking
down
at
it
in
his
turn
i
found
it
leaning
against
the
fence
it
gives
me
all
the
clue
i
need
to
our
friend
ranelagh
will
you
credit
me
with
good
intentions
if
i
ask
a
question
or
two
which
you
may
or
may
not
be
willing
to
answer
you
may
ask
what
you
will
said
i
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
since
hearing
miss
cumberland
explanation
of
her
presence
at
the
whispering
pines
ah
the
ejaculation
was
eloquent
so
was
the
silence
which
followed
it
without
good
reason
perhaps
i
felt
the
strain
upon
my
heart
loosen
a
little
was
it
possible
that
i
should
find
a
friend
in
this
man
the
question
i
am
going
to
ask
he
continued
presently
is
one
which
you
may
consider
unpardonable
let
me
first
express
an
opinion
you
have
not
told
all
that
you
know
of
that
evening
doings
this
called
for
no
reply
and
i
made
none
i
can
understand
your
reticence
if
your
knowledge
included
the
fact
of
miss
cumberland
heroic
act
and
her
sister
manner
of
death
at
the
but
it
did
not
i
asserted
with
deliberate
emphasis
i
knew
nothing
of
either
my
arrival
happened
later
miss
cumberland
testimony
gave
me
my
first
enlightenment
on
these
points
but
i
did
know
that
the
two
sisters
were
there
together
for
i
had
a
glimpse
of
the
younger
as
she
was
leaving
the
house
you
had
and
are
willing
to
state
it
now
assuredly
but
any
testimony
of
that
kind
is
for
the
defence
and
your
interests
are
all
with
the
prosecution
moffat
is
the
man
who
should
talk
to
me
does
he
know
it
yes
who
told
him
i
did
you
yes
it
was
my
duty
you
are
interested
then
in
seeing
young
cumberland
freed
i
must
be
he
is
innocent
the
man
at
my
side
turned
shot
at
me
one
glance
which
i
met
quite
calmly
then
regulating
his
step
by
mine
moved
on
silently
for
a
moment
thinking
as
it
appeared
to
me
some
very
serious
thoughts
it
was
not
until
we
had
traversed
a
whole
block
in
this
way
that
he
finally
put
his
question
whether
it
was
the
one
he
had
first
had
in
mind
i
can
not
say
ranelagh
will
you
tell
me
why
when
you
found
yourself
in
such
a
dire
extremity
as
to
be
arrested
for
this
crime
on
evidence
as
startling
as
to
call
for
all
and
every
possible
testimony
to
your
innocence
you
preserved
silence
in
regard
to
a
fact
which
you
must
have
then
felt
would
have
secured
you
a
most
invaluable
witness
i
can
understand
why
cumberland
has
been
loth
to
speak
of
his
younger
sister
presence
in
the
on
that
night
but
his
reason
was
not
your
reason
yet
you
have
been
as
hard
to
move
on
this
point
as
he
then
it
was
i
regretted
my
thoughtless
promise
to
be
candid
with
this
man
to
answer
were
impossible
yet
silence
has
its
confidences
too
in
my
dilemma
i
turned
towards
him
and
just
then
we
stepped
within
the
glare
of
an
electric
light
pouring
from
some
open
doorway
i
caught
his
eye
and
was
astonished
at
the
change
which
took
place
in
him
do
answer
he
muttered
volubly
it
is
necessary
i
understand
the
situation
now
and
you
shall
never
regret
that
you
met
caleb
sweetwater
on
your
walk
this
evening
will
you
trust
me
sir
a
detective
who
loves
his
profession
is
no
gabbler
your
secret
is
as
safe
with
me
as
if
you
had
buried
it
in
the
grave
and
i
had
said
nothing
he
started
to
go
then
he
stopped
suddenly
and
observed
with
one
of
his
wise
smiles
i
once
spent
several
minutes
in
miss
carmel
cumberland
room
and
i
saw
a
cabinet
there
which
i
found
it
very
hard
to
understand
but
its
meaning
came
to
me
later
i
could
not
rest
till
it
did
at
the
next
moment
he
was
half
way
around
a
corner
and
in
another
out
of
sight
this
was
the
evening
event
xxxiii
the
arrow
of
death
o
if
you
rear
this
house
against
this
house
it
will
the
wofulest
division
prove
that
ever
fell
upon
this
cursed
earth
in
my
first
glance
around
the
the
next
morning
i
sought
first
for
carmel
and
then
for
the
detective
sweetwater
neither
was
visible
but
this
was
not
true
of
ella
she
had
come
in
on
her
father
arm
closely
followed
by
the
erect
figure
of
her
domineering
mother
as
i
scrutinised
the
latter
bearing
i
seemed
to
penetrate
the
mystery
of
her
nature
whatever
humiliation
she
may
have
felt
at
the
public
revelation
of
her
daughter
weakness
it
had
been
absorbed
by
her
love
for
that
daughter
or
had
been
forced
through
the
agency
of
her
indomitable
will
to
become
a
ministrant
to
her
pride
which
was
unassailable
she
had
accepted
the
position
exacted
from
her
by
the
situation
and
she
looked
for
no
loss
of
prestige
either
on
her
daughter
or
her
own
account
such
was
the
language
of
her
eyes
and
it
was
a
language
which
should
have
assured
ella
that
she
had
a
better
friend
in
her
mother
than
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
the
entrance
of
the
defendant
cut
short
my
contemplation
of
any
mere
spectator
the
change
in
him
was
so
marked
that
i
was
conscious
of
it
before
i
really
saw
him
every
eye
had
reflected
it
and
it
was
no
surprise
to
me
when
i
noted
the
relieved
almost
cheerful
aspect
of
his
countenance
as
he
took
his
place
and
met
his
counsel
greeting
with
a
smile
the
first
i
believe
which
had
been
seen
on
his
face
since
his
sister
death
that
counsel
i
had
already
noted
he
was
cheerful
also
but
with
a
restrained
cheerfulness
his
task
was
not
yet
over
and
the
grimness
of
fox
and
the
aspect
of
the
jurymen
proved
that
it
was
not
to
be
made
too
easy
for
him
the
crier
announced
the
opening
of
the
court
and
the
defence
proceeded
by
the
calling
of
ella
fulton
to
the
witness
stand
i
need
not
linger
over
her
testimony
it
was
very
short
and
contained
but
one
surprise
she
had
stated
under
direct
examination
that
she
had
waited
and
watched
for
arthur
return
that
whole
night
and
was
positive
that
he
had
not
passed
through
their
grounds
again
after
that
first
time
in
the
early
evening
this
was
just
what
i
had
expected
from
her
but
the
prosecution
remembered
the
snowfall
and
in
her
on
this
point
she
acknowledged
that
it
was
very
thick
much
too
thick
for
her
to
see
her
own
gate
distinctly
but
added
that
this
only
made
her
surer
of
the
fact
she
had
stated
for
finding
that
she
could
not
see
she
had
dressed
herself
for
the
storm
and
gone
out
into
the
driveway
to
watch
there
and
had
so
watched
until
the
town
clock
struck
three
this
did
not
help
the
prosecution
sympathy
could
not
fail
to
be
with
this
young
and
tremulous
girl
heroic
in
her
love
if
weak
in
other
respects
and
when
on
her
departure
from
the
stand
she
cast
one
deprecatory
glance
at
the
man
for
whom
she
had
thus
sacrificed
her
pride
and
meeting
his
eye
fixed
upon
her
with
anything
but
ingratitude
flushed
and
faltered
till
she
with
difficulty
found
her
way
the
sentiments
of
the
onlookers
became
so
apparent
that
the
judge
gavel
was
called
into
requisition
before
order
could
be
restored
and
the
next
witness
summoned
to
testify
this
witness
was
no
less
a
person
than
arthur
himself
recalled
by
his
counsel
he
was
reminded
of
his
former
statement
that
he
had
left
the
in
a
hurry
because
he
heard
his
sister
adelaide
voice
and
was
now
asked
if
hers
was
the
only
voice
he
had
heard
his
answer
revealed
much
of
his
mind
no
i
heard
carmel
answering
her
this
satisfying
moffat
he
was
passed
over
to
fox
and
a
short
ensued
on
this
point
you
heard
both
your
sisters
speaking
yes
sir
any
of
their
words
or
only
their
voices
i
heard
one
word
what
word
the
word
in
which
voice
in
that
of
my
sister
adelaide
and
you
fled
immediately
leaving
your
two
sisters
alone
in
this
cold
and
house
i
did
not
think
they
were
alone
who
did
you
think
was
with
them
i
have
already
mentioned
the
name
yet
you
left
them
yes
i
already
explained
that
i
was
engaged
in
a
mean
act
i
was
ashamed
to
be
caught
at
it
by
adelaide
i
preferred
flight
i
had
no
premonition
of
tragedy
any
such
tragedy
as
afterwards
occurred
i
understood
neither
of
my
sisters
and
my
thoughts
were
only
for
myself
did
you
so
much
as
try
to
account
for
their
both
being
there
not
then
had
you
expected
adelaide
to
accompany
your
younger
sister
when
you
harnessed
the
horse
for
her
no
sir
had
not
this
younger
sister
even
enjoined
secrecy
upon
you
in
asking
you
to
harness
the
horse
yes
sir
yet
you
heard
the
two
together
in
this
remote
building
without
surprise
no
i
must
have
felt
surprise
but
i
did
stop
to
analyse
my
feelings
afterward
i
turned
it
over
in
my
mind
and
tried
to
make
something
out
of
the
whole
thing
but
that
was
when
i
was
far
out
on
the
links
a
losing
game
thus
far
this
the
district
attorney
seemed
to
feel
but
he
was
not
an
ungenerous
man
though
cursed
perhaps
i
should
say
blessed
considering
the
position
he
held
by
a
tenacity
which
never
let
him
lose
his
hold
until
the
jury
gave
their
verdict
you
have
a
right
to
explain
yourself
fully
said
he
after
a
momentary
struggle
in
which
his
generosity
triumphed
over
his
pride
when
you
did
think
of
your
sisters
what
explanation
did
you
give
yourself
of
the
facts
we
have
just
been
considering
i
could
not
imagine
the
truth
so
i
just
satisfied
myself
that
adelaide
had
discovered
carmel
intentions
to
ride
into
town
and
had
insisted
on
accompanying
her
they
were
having
it
out
i
thought
in
the
presence
of
the
man
who
had
made
all
this
trouble
between
them
and
you
left
them
to
the
task
yes
sir
but
not
without
a
struggle
i
was
minded
several
times
to
return
this
i
have
testified
to
before
did
this
struggle
consume
forty
minutes
it
must
have
and
more
if
i
entered
the
hold
in
cuthbert
road
at
the
hour
they
state
fox
gave
up
the
game
and
i
looked
to
be
the
next
person
called
but
it
was
not
a
part
of
moffat
plan
to
weaken
the
effect
of
testimony
by
offering
any
weak
corroboration
of
facts
which
nobody
showed
the
least
inclination
to
dispute
satisfied
with
having
given
the
jury
an
opportunity
to
contrast
his
client
present
cheerfulness
and
manly
aspect
with
the
sullenness
he
had
maintained
while
in
doubt
of
real
connection
with
this
crime
moffat
rested
his
case
there
was
no
testimony
offered
in
rebuttal
and
the
court
took
a
recess
when
it
reassembled
i
cast
another
anxious
glance
around
still
no
carmel
nor
any
signs
of
sweetwater
i
could
understand
her
absence
but
not
his
and
it
was
in
a
confusion
of
feeling
which
was
fast
getting
the
upper
hand
of
me
that
i
turned
my
attention
to
moffat
and
the
plea
he
was
about
to
make
for
his
youthful
client
i
do
not
wish
to
obtrude
myself
too
much
into
this
trial
of
another
man
for
the
murder
of
my
betrothed
but
when
after
a
wait
during
which
the
prisoner
had
a
chance
to
show
his
mettle
under
the
concentrated
gaze
of
an
expectant
crowd
the
senior
counsel
for
the
defence
slowly
rose
and
lifting
his
ungainly
length
till
his
shoulders
lost
their
stoop
and
his
whole
presence
acquired
a
dignity
which
had
been
entirely
absent
from
it
up
to
this
decisive
moment
i
felt
a
sudden
slow
and
creeping
chill
seize
and
shake
me
as
i
have
heard
people
say
they
experienced
when
uttering
the
common
expression
some
one
is
walking
over
my
grave
it
was
not
that
he
glanced
my
way
for
this
he
did
not
do
yet
i
received
a
subtle
message
from
him
by
some
telepathic
means
i
could
neither
understand
nor
respond
to
a
message
of
warning
or
possibly
of
simple
preparation
for
what
his
coming
speech
might
convey
it
laid
my
spirits
low
for
a
moment
then
they
rose
as
those
of
a
better
man
might
rise
at
the
scent
of
danger
if
he
could
warn
he
could
also
withhold
i
would
trust
him
or
i
would
at
least
trust
my
fate
and
so
to
self
arthur
life
and
carmel
future
peace
were
trembling
in
the
balance
surely
these
were
worth
the
full
attention
of
the
man
who
loved
the
woman
who
pitied
the
man
at
the
next
moment
i
heard
these
words
delivered
in
the
slow
and
but
slightly
raised
tones
with
which
moffat
invariably
began
his
address
may
it
please
the
court
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
my
learned
friend
of
the
prosecution
has
shown
great
discretion
in
that
so
far
as
appears
from
the
trend
of
his
examinations
he
is
planning
no
attempt
to
explain
the
many
silences
and
the
often
forbidding
attitude
of
my
young
client
by
any
theory
save
the
obvious
one
the
natural
desire
of
a
brother
to
hide
his
only
remaining
sister
connection
with
a
tragedy
of
whose
details
he
was
ignorant
and
concerning
which
he
had
formed
a
theory
derogatory
to
her
position
as
a
young
and
woman
i
am
therefore
spared
the
task
of
pressing
upon
your
consideration
these
very
natural
and
i
may
add
laudable
grounds
for
my
client
many
hesitations
and
suppressions
which
under
other
circumstances
would
militate
so
deeply
against
him
in
the
eyes
of
an
upright
and
impartial
jury
any
man
with
a
heart
in
his
breast
and
a
sense
of
honour
in
his
soul
can
understand
why
this
man
whatever
his
record
and
however
impervious
he
may
have
seemed
in
the
days
of
his
prosperity
and
the
wilfulness
of
his
youth
should
recoil
from
revelations
which
would
attack
the
honour
if
not
the
life
of
a
young
and
beautiful
sister
sole
remnant
of
a
family
eminent
in
station
and
in
all
those
moral
and
civic
attributes
which
make
for
the
honour
of
a
town
and
lend
distinction
to
its
history
fear
for
a
loved
one
even
in
one
whom
you
will
probably
hear
described
as
a
dissipated
man
of
selfish
tendencies
and
hitherto
unbrotherly
qualities
is
a
great
no
sacrifice
seems
impossible
which
serves
as
a
guard
for
one
so
situated
and
so
threatened
let
us
review
his
history
let
us
disentangle
if
we
can
our
knowledge
of
what
occurred
in
the
clubhouse
from
his
knowledge
of
it
at
the
time
he
showed
these
unexpected
traits
of
and
brotherly
anxiety
which
you
will
yet
hear
so
severely
scored
by
my
able
opponent
his
was
a
nature
in
which
honourable
instincts
had
forever
battled
with
the
secret
predilections
of
youth
for
independence
and
free
living
he
rebelled
at
all
monition
but
this
did
not
make
him
altogether
insensible
to
the
secret
ties
of
kinship
or
the
claims
upon
his
protection
of
two
highly
gifted
sisters
consciously
or
unconsciously
he
kept
watch
upon
the
two
and
when
he
saw
that
an
extraneous
influence
was
undermining
their
mutual
confidence
he
rebelled
in
his
heart
whatever
restraint
he
may
have
put
upon
his
tongue
and
actions
then
came
an
evening
when
with
heart
already
rasped
by
a
personal
humiliation
he
saw
a
letter
passed
you
have
heard
the
letter
and
listened
to
its
answer
but
he
knew
nothing
beyond
the
fact
a
fact
which
soon
received
a
terrible
significance
from
the
events
which
so
speedily
followed
here
moffat
recapitulated
those
events
but
always
from
the
standpoint
of
the
defendant
a
standpoint
which
necessarily
brought
before
the
jury
the
many
excellent
reasons
which
his
client
had
for
supposing
this
crime
to
have
resulted
solely
from
the
conflicting
interests
represented
by
that
furtively
passed
note
and
the
visit
of
two
girls
instead
of
one
to
the
whispering
pines
it
was
very
convincing
especially
his
picture
of
arthur
impulsive
flight
from
the
at
the
first
sound
of
his
sisters
voices
the
learned
counsel
for
the
people
may
call
this
unnatural
he
cried
he
may
say
that
no
brother
would
leave
the
place
under
such
circumstances
whether
sober
or
not
sober
alive
to
duty
or
dead
to
it
that
curiosity
would
hold
him
there
if
nothing
else
but
he
forgets
if
thus
he
thinks
and
thus
would
have
you
think
that
the
man
who
now
confronts
you
from
the
bar
is
separated
by
an
immense
experience
from
the
boy
he
was
at
that
hour
of
surprise
and
selfish
preoccupation
you
who
have
heard
the
defendant
tell
how
he
could
not
remember
if
he
carried
up
one
or
two
bottles
from
the
kitchen
can
imagine
the
blank
condition
of
this
untutored
mind
at
the
moment
when
those
voices
fell
upon
his
ear
calling
him
to
responsibilities
he
had
never
before
shouldered
and
which
he
saw
no
way
of
shouldering
now
in
that
first
instant
of
inconsiderate
escape
he
was
alarmed
for
himself
afraid
of
the
discovery
of
the
sneaking
act
of
which
he
had
just
been
guilty
not
fearful
for
his
sisters
would
have
done
differently
but
you
are
all
men
disciplined
to
forget
yourselves
and
think
first
of
others
taught
in
the
school
of
life
to
face
responsibility
rather
than
shirk
it
but
discipline
had
not
yet
reached
this
unhappy
boy
the
slave
so
far
of
his
unfortunate
habits
it
began
its
work
later
yet
not
much
later
before
he
had
half
crossed
the
the
sense
of
what
he
had
done
stopped
him
in
middle
course
and
reckless
of
the
oncoming
storm
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
place
he
was
making
for
only
to
switch
around
again
as
craving
got
the
better
of
his
curiosity
or
of
that
deeper
feeling
to
which
my
experienced
opponent
will
no
doubt
touchingly
allude
when
he
comes
to
survey
this
situation
with
you
the
storm
continuing
obliterated
his
steps
as
fast
as
the
ever
whitening
spaces
beneath
received
them
but
if
it
had
stopped
then
and
there
leaving
those
wandering
imprints
to
tell
their
story
what
a
tale
we
might
have
read
of
the
first
secret
conflict
in
this
awakening
soul
i
leave
you
to
imagine
this
history
and
pass
to
the
bitter
hour
when
racked
by
a
night
of
dissipation
he
was
aroused
indeed
to
the
magnitude
of
his
fault
and
the
awful
consequences
of
his
by
the
news
of
his
elder
sister
violent
death
and
the
hardly
less
pitiful
condition
of
the
younger
the
younger
the
pause
he
here
made
was
more
eloquent
than
any
words
is
it
for
me
to
laud
her
virtues
or
to
seek
to
impress
upon
you
in
this
connection
the
overwhelming
nature
of
the
events
which
in
reality
had
laid
her
mind
and
body
low
you
have
seen
her
you
have
heard
her
and
the
memory
of
the
tale
she
has
here
told
will
never
leave
you
or
lose
its
hold
upon
your
sympathies
or
your
admiration
if
everything
else
connected
with
this
case
is
forgotten
the
recollection
of
that
will
remain
you
and
i
and
all
who
wait
upon
your
verdict
will
in
due
time
pass
from
among
the
living
and
leave
small
print
behind
us
on
the
sands
of
time
but
her
act
will
not
die
and
to
it
i
now
offer
the
homage
of
silence
since
that
would
best
please
her
heroic
soul
which
broke
the
bonds
of
womanly
reserve
only
to
save
from
an
unmerited
charge
a
falsely
arraigned
brother
the
restraint
and
yet
the
fire
with
which
moffat
uttered
these
simple
words
lifted
all
hearts
and
surcharged
the
atmosphere
with
an
emotion
rarely
awakened
in
a
court
of
law
not
in
my
pulses
alone
was
started
the
electric
current
of
renewed
life
the
jury
to
a
man
glowed
with
enthusiasm
and
from
the
audience
rose
one
long
and
suppressed
sigh
of
answering
feeling
which
was
all
the
tribute
he
needed
for
his
eloquence
or
carmel
for
her
uncalculating
deed
i
could
have
called
upon
the
mountains
to
cover
but
god
be
praised
no
one
thought
of
me
in
that
hour
every
throb
every
thought
was
for
her
at
the
proper
moment
of
subsiding
feeling
moffat
again
raised
his
voice
gentlemen
of
the
jury
you
have
seen
point
after
point
of
the
prosecution
case
demolished
before
your
eyes
by
testimony
which
no
one
has
had
the
temerity
to
attempt
to
controvert
what
is
left
fox
will
tell
you
three
strong
and
unassailable
facts
the
ring
found
in
the
murdered
woman
casket
the
remnants
of
the
bottle
discovered
in
the
cumberland
stable
and
the
opportunity
for
crime
given
by
the
acknowledged
presence
of
the
defendant
on
or
near
the
scene
of
death
he
will
harp
on
these
facts
he
will
make
much
of
them
and
he
will
be
justified
in
doing
so
for
they
are
the
only
links
remaining
of
the
strong
chain
forged
so
carefully
against
my
client
but
are
these
points
so
vital
as
they
seem
let
us
consider
them
and
see
my
client
has
denied
that
he
dropped
anything
into
his
casket
much
less
the
ring
missing
from
that
sister
finger
dare
you
then
convict
on
this
point
when
according
to
count
ten
other
persons
were
seen
to
drop
flowers
into
this
very
place
any
one
of
which
might
have
carried
this
object
with
it
and
the
bit
of
broken
bottle
found
in
or
near
the
defendant
own
stable
is
he
to
be
convicted
on
the
similarity
it
offers
to
the
one
known
to
have
come
from
the
while
a
reasonable
doubt
remains
of
his
having
been
the
hand
which
carried
it
there
no
where
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
no
jury
will
convict
and
i
claim
that
my
client
has
made
it
plain
that
there
is
such
a
reasonable
doubt
all
this
and
more
did
moffat
dilate
upon
but
i
could
no
longer
fix
my
mind
on
details
and
much
of
this
portion
of
his
address
escaped
me
but
i
do
remember
the
startling
picture
with
which
he
closed
his
argument
so
far
had
been
based
on
the
assumption
of
arthur
ignorance
of
carmers
purpose
in
visiting
the
or
of
adelaide
attempt
at
suicide
his
client
had
left
the
building
when
he
said
he
did
and
knew
no
more
of
what
happened
there
afterward
than
circumstances
showed
or
his
own
imagination
conceived
but
now
the
advocate
took
a
sudden
turn
and
calmly
asked
the
jury
to
consider
with
him
the
alternative
outlined
by
the
prosecution
in
the
evidence
set
before
them
my
distinguished
opponent
said
he
would
have
you
believe
that
the
defendant
did
not
fly
at
the
moment
declared
but
that
he
waited
to
fulfil
the
foul
deed
which
is
the
only
serious
matter
in
dispute
in
his
so
nearly
destroyed
case
i
hear
as
though
he
were
now
speaking
the
attack
which
he
will
make
upon
my
client
when
he
comes
to
review
this
matter
with
you
let
me
see
if
i
can
not
make
you
hear
those
words
too
and
with
a
daring
smile
at
his
discomforted
adversary
alonzo
moffat
launched
forth
into
the
following
sarcasm
arthur
cumberland
coming
up
the
kitchen
stairs
hears
voices
where
he
had
expected
total
silence
sees
light
where
he
had
left
total
darkness
he
has
two
bottles
in
his
hands
or
in
his
large
if
they
are
in
his
hands
he
sets
them
down
and
steals
forward
to
listen
he
has
recognised
the
voices
they
are
those
of
his
two
sisters
one
of
whom
had
ordered
him
to
hitch
up
the
cutter
for
her
to
escape
as
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
the
other
curiosity
or
is
it
some
nobler
feeling
causes
him
to
draw
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
room
in
which
they
have
taken
up
their
stand
he
can
hear
their
words
now
and
what
are
the
words
he
hears
words
that
would
thrill
the
most
impervious
heart
call
for
the
interference
of
the
most
indifferent
but
is
made
of
ice
welded
together
with
steel
he
sees
for
no
place
save
one
from
which
he
can
watch
and
see
the
dark
dancing
hall
would
satisfy
any
man
of
such
gigantic
curiosity
adelaide
fall
at
carmel
feet
in
recognition
of
the
great
sacrifice
she
has
made
for
her
but
he
does
not
move
he
falls
at
no
one
feet
he
recognises
no
nobility
responds
to
no
higher
appeal
stony
and
unmoved
he
crouches
there
and
watches
and
watches
still
curious
or
still
feeding
his
hate
on
the
sufferings
of
the
elder
the
forbearance
of
the
younger
and
on
what
does
he
look
you
have
already
heard
but
consider
it
adelaide
despairing
of
happiness
decides
on
death
for
herself
or
sister
both
loving
one
man
one
of
the
two
must
give
way
to
the
other
carmel
has
done
her
part
she
must
now
do
hers
she
has
brought
poison
she
has
brought
glasses
three
glasses
for
three
persons
but
only
two
are
on
the
scene
and
so
she
fills
but
two
one
has
only
cordial
in
it
but
the
other
is
as
she
believes
deadly
carmel
is
to
have
her
choice
but
who
believes
that
adelaide
would
ever
have
let
her
drink
the
poisoned
glass
and
this
man
looks
on
as
the
two
faces
confront
each
other
one
white
with
the
overthrow
of
every
earthly
hope
the
other
under
the
stress
of
suffering
and
a
fascination
of
horror
sufficient
to
have
laid
her
dead
without
poison
at
the
other
one
feet
this
is
what
he
sees
brother
and
he
makes
no
move
then
or
afterwards
when
the
die
cast
adelaide
succumbs
to
her
fear
and
falls
into
a
seemingly
dying
state
on
the
couch
does
he
go
now
is
his
hate
or
his
cupidity
satisfied
no
he
remains
and
listens
to
the
tender
interchange
of
final
words
and
all
the
late
precautions
of
the
elder
to
guard
the
younger
woman
good
name
still
he
is
not
softened
and
when
the
critical
moment
passed
carmel
rises
and
totters
about
the
room
in
her
endeavour
to
fulfil
the
tasks
enjoined
upon
her
by
her
sister
he
gloats
over
a
death
which
will
give
him
independence
and
gluts
himself
with
every
evil
thought
which
could
blind
him
to
the
pitiful
aspects
of
a
tragedy
such
as
few
men
in
this
world
could
see
unmoved
but
this
is
not
the
worst
the
awful
cup
of
human
greed
and
hatred
is
but
filled
to
the
brim
it
has
not
yet
overflowed
carmel
leaves
the
room
she
has
a
telephonic
message
to
deliver
she
may
be
gone
a
minute
she
may
be
gone
many
little
does
he
care
which
he
must
see
the
dead
look
down
on
the
woman
who
has
been
like
a
mother
to
him
and
see
if
her
influence
is
forever
removed
if
his
wealth
is
his
and
his
independence
forever
assured
safe
in
the
darkness
of
the
gloomy
recesses
of
the
dancing
hall
he
steals
slowly
forward
drawn
as
by
a
magnet
he
enters
the
room
of
seeming
death
draws
up
to
the
couch
pulls
off
first
one
cushion
and
then
another
till
face
and
hands
are
bare
and
ah
there
is
a
movement
death
has
not
then
done
its
work
she
lives
the
hated
one
and
he
is
no
longer
rich
no
longer
independent
with
a
clutch
he
seizes
her
at
the
feeble
seat
of
life
and
as
the
breath
ceases
and
her
whole
body
becomes
again
inert
he
stoops
to
pull
off
the
ring
which
can
have
no
especial
value
or
meaning
for
him
and
then
repiling
the
cushions
over
her
creeps
forth
again
takes
up
the
bottles
and
disappears
from
the
house
gentlemen
of
the
jury
this
is
what
my
opponent
would
have
you
believe
this
will
be
his
explanation
of
this
extraordinary
murder
but
when
his
eloquence
meets
your
ears
when
you
hear
this
arraignment
and
the
emphasis
he
will
place
upon
the
few
points
remaining
to
his
broken
case
then
ask
yourself
if
you
see
such
a
monster
in
the
prisoner
now
confronting
you
from
the
bar
i
do
not
believe
it
i
do
not
believe
that
such
a
monster
lives
but
you
say
entered
that
room
stilled
the
fluttering
life
still
remaining
in
that
feeble
breast
some
one
may
have
but
that
some
one
was
not
my
client
and
it
is
his
guilt
or
innocence
we
are
considering
now
and
it
is
his
life
and
freedom
for
which
you
are
responsible
no
brother
did
that
deed
no
witness
of
the
scene
which
hallowed
this
tragedy
ever
lifted
hand
against
the
fainting
adelaide
or
choked
back
a
life
which
kindly
fate
had
spared
go
further
for
the
guilty
perpetrator
of
this
most
inhuman
act
he
stands
not
in
the
dock
guilt
shows
no
such
relief
as
you
see
in
him
guilt
would
remember
that
his
sister
testimony
under
the
of
the
people
prosecutor
left
the
charge
of
murder
still
hanging
over
the
defendant
head
but
the
brother
has
forgotten
this
his
restored
confidence
in
one
who
now
represents
to
him
father
mother
and
sister
has
thrown
his
own
fate
into
the
background
will
you
dim
that
joy
sustain
this
charge
of
murder
if
in
your
sense
of
justice
you
do
so
you
forever
place
this
degenerate
son
of
a
noble
father
on
the
list
of
the
most
unimaginative
and
criminals
of
all
time
is
he
such
a
demon
is
he
such
a
madman
look
in
his
face
and
decide
i
am
willing
to
leave
his
cause
in
your
hands
it
could
be
placed
in
no
better
may
it
please
your
honour
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury
i
am
done
if
any
one
at
that
moment
felt
the
arrow
of
death
descending
into
his
heart
it
was
not
arthur
cumberland
xxxiv
steady
i
am
a
tainted
wether
of
the
flock
meetest
for
death
the
weakest
kind
of
fruit
drops
earliest
to
the
ground
and
so
let
me
you
can
not
better
be
employ
bassanio
than
to
live
still
and
write
my
epitaph
of
why
linger
over
the
result
arthur
cumberland
case
was
won
before
fox
arose
to
his
feet
the
usual
routine
was
gone
through
the
district
attorney
made
the
most
of
the
three
facts
which
he
declared
inconsistent
with
the
prisoner
innocence
just
as
moffat
said
he
would
but
the
life
was
gone
from
his
work
and
the
result
was
necessarily
unsatisfactory
the
judge
charge
was
short
but
studiously
impartial
when
the
jury
filed
out
i
said
to
myself
they
will
return
in
fifteen
minutes
they
returned
in
ten
with
a
verdict
of
acquittal
the
demonstrations
of
joy
which
followed
filled
my
ears
and
doubtless
left
their
impression
upon
my
other
senses
but
my
mind
took
in
nothing
but
the
apparition
of
my
own
form
taking
his
place
at
the
bar
under
circumstances
less
favourable
to
acquittal
than
those
which
had
exonerated
him
it
was
a
picture
which
set
my
brain
whirling
a
phantom
judge
a
phantom
jury
a
phantom
circle
of
faces
lacking
the
consideration
and
confidence
of
those
i
saw
before
me
but
not
a
phantom
prisoner
or
any
mere
dream
of
outrageous
shame
and
suffering
that
shame
and
that
suffering
had
already
seized
hold
of
me
with
the
relief
of
young
arthur
acquittal
my
faculties
had
cleared
to
the
desperate
position
in
which
this
very
acquittal
had
placed
me
i
saw
as
never
before
how
the
testimony
which
had
reinstated
carmel
in
my
heart
and
won
for
her
and
through
her
the
sympathies
of
the
whole
people
had
overthrown
every
specious
reason
which
i
and
those
interested
in
me
had
been
able
to
advance
in
contradiction
of
the
natural
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
the
damning
fact
of
my
having
been
seen
with
my
fingers
on
adelaide
throat
moffat
words
rang
in
my
ears
some
one
entered
that
room
some
one
stilled
the
fluttering
life
still
remaining
in
that
feeble
breast
but
that
some
one
was
not
her
brother
you
must
look
further
for
the
guilty
perpetrator
of
this
most
inhuman
act
some
one
who
had
not
been
a
witness
to
the
scene
preceding
this
tragedy
some
one
he
had
not
said
this
but
every
mind
had
supplied
the
omission
some
one
who
had
come
in
later
who
came
in
after
carmel
had
gone
some
one
who
knew
nothing
of
the
telephone
message
which
was
even
then
hastening
the
police
to
the
spot
some
one
who
had
every
reason
for
lifting
those
cushions
and
on
meeting
the
horror
stifled
me
i
was
reeling
in
my
place
on
the
edge
of
the
crowd
when
i
heard
a
quiet
voice
in
my
ear
steady
their
eyes
will
soon
be
off
of
arthur
and
then
they
will
look
at
you
it
was
clifton
and
his
word
came
none
too
soon
i
stiffened
under
its
quiet
force
and
taking
his
arm
let
him
lead
me
out
of
a
side
door
where
the
crowd
was
smaller
and
its
attention
even
more
absorbed
i
soon
saw
its
cause
carmel
was
entering
the
doorway
from
the
street
she
had
come
to
greet
her
brother
and
her
face
quite
unveiled
was
beaming
with
beauty
and
joy
in
an
instant
i
forgot
myself
forgot
everything
but
her
and
the
effect
she
produced
upon
those
about
her
no
noisy
demonstration
here
admiration
and
love
were
shown
in
looks
and
the
prayer
for
her
welfare
which
escaped
from
more
than
one
pair
of
lips
she
smiled
and
their
hearts
were
hers
she
essayed
to
move
forward
and
the
people
crowded
back
as
if
at
a
queen
passage
but
there
was
no
noise
when
she
reappeared
it
was
on
arthur
arm
i
had
not
been
able
to
move
from
the
place
in
which
we
were
hemmed
nor
had
i
wished
to
i
was
hungry
for
a
glance
of
her
eye
would
it
turn
my
way
and
if
it
did
would
it
leave
a
curse
or
a
blessing
behind
it
in
anxiety
for
the
blessing
i
was
willing
to
risk
the
curse
and
i
followed
her
every
step
with
hungry
glances
until
she
reached
the
doorway
and
turned
to
give
another
shake
of
the
hand
to
moffat
who
had
followed
them
but
she
did
not
see
me
i
can
not
miss
it
i
must
catch
her
eye
i
whispered
to
clifton
get
me
out
of
this
it
will
be
several
minutes
before
they
can
reach
the
sleigh
let
me
see
her
for
one
instant
face
to
face
clifton
disapproved
and
made
me
aware
of
it
but
he
did
my
bidding
nevertheless
in
a
few
moments
we
were
on
the
sidewalk
and
quite
by
ourselves
so
that
if
she
turned
again
she
could
not
fail
to
observe
me
i
had
small
hope
however
that
she
would
so
turn
she
and
arthur
were
within
a
few
feet
of
the
curb
and
their
own
sleigh
i
had
just
time
to
see
this
sleigh
and
note
the
rejoicing
face
of
zadok
leaning
sideways
from
the
box
when
i
beheld
her
pause
and
slowly
turn
her
head
around
and
peer
eagerly
and
with
what
divine
anxiety
in
her
eyes
back
over
the
heads
of
those
thronging
about
her
until
her
gaze
rested
fully
and
sweetly
on
mine
my
heart
leaped
then
sank
down
down
into
unutterable
depths
for
in
that
instant
her
face
changed
horror
seized
upon
her
beauty
and
shook
her
frantic
hold
on
arthur
arm
i
heard
words
uttered
very
near
me
but
i
did
not
catch
them
i
did
feel
however
the
hand
which
was
laid
strongly
and
with
authority
upon
my
shoulder
and
tearing
my
eyes
from
her
face
only
long
enough
to
perceive
that
it
was
sweetwater
who
had
thus
arrested
me
i
looked
back
at
her
in
time
to
see
the
questions
leap
from
her
lips
to
arthur
whose
answers
i
could
well
understand
from
the
pitying
movement
in
the
crowd
and
the
low
hum
of
restrained
voices
which
ran
between
her
sinking
figure
and
the
spot
where
i
stood
apart
with
the
detective
hand
on
my
shoulder
she
had
never
been
told
of
the
incriminating
position
in
which
i
had
been
seen
in
the
it
had
been
carefully
kept
from
her
and
she
had
supposed
that
my
acquittal
in
the
public
mind
was
as
certain
as
arthur
now
she
saw
herself
undeceived
and
the
reaction
into
doubt
and
misery
was
too
much
for
her
and
i
saw
her
sinking
under
my
eyes
let
me
go
to
her
i
shrieked
utterly
unconcerned
with
anything
in
the
world
but
this
tottering
fainting
girl
but
sweetwater
hand
only
tightened
on
my
shoulder
while
arthur
with
an
awful
look
at
me
caught
his
sister
in
his
arms
just
as
she
fell
to
the
ground
before
the
swaying
multitude
but
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
kneel
there
with
a
sound
of
love
and
misery
impossible
to
describe
zadok
had
leaped
from
the
box
and
had
grovelled
at
those
dear
feet
kissing
the
insensible
hands
and
praying
for
those
shut
eyes
to
open
even
after
arthur
had
lifted
her
into
the
sleigh
the
man
remained
crouching
where
she
had
fallen
with
his
eyes
roaming
back
and
forth
in
a
sightless
stare
from
her
to
myself
muttering
and
groaning
and
totally
unheedful
of
arthur
commands
to
mount
the
box
and
drive
home
finally
some
one
else
stepped
from
the
crowd
and
mercifully
took
the
reins
i
caught
one
more
glimpse
of
her
face
with
arthur
bent
tenderly
over
it
then
the
sleigh
slipped
away
an
officer
shook
zadok
by
the
arm
and
he
got
up
and
began
to
move
aside
then
i
had
mind
to
face
my
own
fate
and
looking
up
i
met
sweetwater
eye
it
was
quietly
apologetic
i
only
wished
to
congratulate
you
said
he
on
the
conclusion
of
a
case
in
which
i
know
you
are
highly
interested
lifting
his
hat
he
nodded
affably
and
was
gone
before
i
could
recover
from
my
stupor
it
was
for
clifton
to
show
his
indignation
i
was
past
all
feeling
farce
as
an
never
appealed
to
me
would
i
have
considered
it
farce
if
i
could
have
heard
the
words
which
this
detective
was
at
that
moment
whispering
into
the
district
attorney
ears
do
you
want
to
know
who
throttled
adelaide
cumberland
it
was
not
her
brother
it
was
not
her
lover
it
was
her
old
and
trusted
coachman
xxxv
as
if
it
were
a
mecca
i
have
within
my
mind
a
thousand
raw
tricks
of
these
bragging
jacks
which
i
will
practise
of
give
me
your
reasons
they
must
be
excellent
ones
sweetwater
or
you
would
not
risk
making
a
second
mistake
in
a
case
of
this
magnitude
and
publicity
fox
they
are
excellent
but
you
shall
judge
of
them
from
the
moment
miss
carmel
cumberland
overthrew
the
very
foundations
of
our
case
by
her
remarkable
testimony
i
have
felt
that
my
work
was
only
half
done
it
was
a
strain
on
credulity
to
believe
arthur
guilty
of
a
crime
so
prefaced
and
the
alternative
which
moffat
believed
in
which
you
were
beginning
to
believe
in
and
perhaps
are
allowing
yourself
to
believe
in
even
now
never
appealed
to
me
i
allude
to
the
very
natural
suspicion
that
the
act
beheld
by
your
man
clarke
was
a
criminal
act
and
that
ranelagh
is
the
man
really
responsible
for
miss
cumberland
death
some
instinct
held
me
back
from
this
conclusion
as
well
as
the
incontrovertible
fact
that
he
could
have
had
no
hand
in
carrying
that
piece
of
broken
bottle
into
the
cumberland
stable
or
of
dropping
his
engagement
ring
in
the
suggestive
place
where
it
was
found
where
then
should
i
look
for
the
unknown
the
unsuspected
third
party
among
the
ten
other
persons
who
dropped
something
into
that
casket
most
of
these
were
children
but
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
every
one
i
spent
most
of
my
sunday
that
way
then
finding
no
clouded
eye
among
them
i
began
a
study
of
the
cumberland
servants
naturally
starting
with
zadok
for
two
hours
i
sat
at
his
stable
fire
talking
and
turning
him
inside
out
as
only
we
detectives
know
how
i
found
him
actually
overwhelmed
with
grief
not
the
grief
of
a
sane
man
but
of
one
in
whom
the
very
springs
of
life
are
poisoned
by
some
dreadful
remorse
he
did
not
know
he
revealed
this
he
expressed
himself
as
full
of
hope
that
his
young
master
would
be
acquitted
the
next
day
but
i
could
see
that
this
prospect
could
never
still
the
worm
working
at
his
heart
and
resolved
to
understand
why
i
left
him
ostensibly
alone
but
in
reality
shadowed
him
the
consequence
was
that
in
the
evening
dusk
he
led
me
to
the
cemetery
where
he
took
up
his
watch
at
miss
cumberland
grave
as
if
it
were
a
mecca
and
he
a
passionate
devotee
i
could
hear
his
groans
as
he
hung
to
the
fence
and
spoke
softly
to
the
dead
and
though
i
was
too
far
away
to
catch
a
single
word
i
felt
confident
that
i
had
at
last
struck
the
right
track
and
should
soon
see
my
way
more
clearly
than
at
any
time
since
this
baffling
case
opened
but
before
i
allowed
my
fancy
to
run
away
with
me
i
put
in
an
evening
of
inquiry
if
this
man
had
an
absolute
alibi
what
was
the
use
of
wasting
effort
upon
him
but
i
could
not
find
that
he
had
fox
he
went
with
the
rest
of
the
servants
to
the
ball
which
you
know
was
held
in
tibbitt
hall
on
ford
street
and
he
was
seen
there
later
dancing
and
making
merry
in
a
way
not
usual
to
him
but
there
was
a
space
of
time
dangerously
tallying
with
that
of
the
tragic
scene
at
the
when
he
was
not
seen
by
any
one
there
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
and
this
fact
gave
me
courage
to
consider
a
certain
point
which
had
struck
me
and
of
which
i
thought
something
might
be
made
fox
after
the
fiasco
i
have
made
of
this
affair
it
costs
me
something
to
go
into
petty
details
which
must
suggest
my
former
failures
and
may
not
strike
you
with
the
force
they
did
me
that
broken
bottle
or
rather
that
piece
of
broken
bottle
where
was
the
rest
of
it
sought
for
almost
immediately
after
the
tragedy
it
had
not
been
found
at
the
cumberland
place
or
on
the
it
had
been
looked
for
carefully
when
the
first
thaw
came
but
though
glass
was
picked
up
it
was
not
the
same
glass
the
task
had
become
hopeless
and
ere
long
was
abandoned
but
with
this
idea
of
zadok
being
the
means
of
its
transfer
from
the
whispering
pines
to
the
house
on
the
hill
i
felt
the
desire
to
look
once
more
and
while
court
was
in
session
this
morning
i
started
a
fresh
search
this
time
not
on
the
tibbitt
hall
communicates
more
quickly
with
the
whispering
pines
by
the
road
than
by
the
market
one
so
i
directed
my
attention
to
the
ground
in
front
and
on
the
further
side
of
the
driveways
i
found
the
neck
of
that
yes
sir
i
will
show
it
to
you
later
i
picked
it
up
at
some
distance
from
the
northern
driveway
under
a
small
tree
against
the
trunk
of
which
it
had
evidently
been
struck
off
this
meant
that
the
lower
part
had
been
carried
away
broken
now
who
would
do
this
but
zadok
who
saw
in
it
he
has
said
a
receptacle
for
some
varnish
which
he
had
and
if
zadok
how
had
he
carried
it
if
not
in
some
pocket
of
his
greatcoat
but
glass
edges
make
quick
work
with
pockets
and
if
this
piece
of
bottle
had
gone
from
the
whispering
pines
to
tibbitt
hall
and
from
there
to
the
hill
there
should
be
some
token
of
its
work
in
zadok
overcoat
pocket
this
led
me
to
look
for
those
tokens
and
as
i
had
by
this
time
insinuated
my
way
into
his
confidence
by
a
free
and
cheerful
manner
which
gave
him
a
rest
from
his
gloomy
thoughts
i
soon
had
a
chance
to
see
for
myself
the
condition
of
those
pockets
the
result
was
quite
satisfactory
in
one
of
them
i
found
a
frayed
lining
easily
explainable
on
the
theory
i
had
advanced
that
pocket
can
be
seen
by
you
but
fox
i
wanted
some
real
proof
i
was
willing
to
embarrass
another
man
or
to
risk
my
own
reputation
on
a
hazard
so
blind
as
this
without
something
really
definite
a
confession
was
what
i
wanted
or
such
a
breakdown
of
the
man
as
would
warrant
police
action
how
could
i
get
this
i
am
a
pupil
of
gryce
and
i
remembered
some
of
his
methods
this
man
guilty
though
he
might
be
loved
this
family
and
was
over
the
trouble
in
which
he
saw
it
plunged
excused
from
attendance
at
court
he
was
in
constant
telephonic
communication
with
some
friend
of
his
who
kept
him
posted
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
trial
and
the
probabilities
of
a
favourable
verdict
if
the
case
had
gone
against
arthur
we
should
have
heard
from
his
coachman
that
i
verily
believe
but
when
we
all
saw
that
he
was
likely
to
be
acquitted
i
realised
that
some
other
course
must
be
taken
to
shake
zadok
from
his
new
won
complacency
and
i
chose
the
most
obvious
one
just
when
everything
looked
most
favourable
to
their
restored
peace
and
happiness
i
shocked
miss
carmel
and
through
her
this
zadok
into
the
belief
that
the
whole
agony
was
to
be
gone
over
again
in
the
rearrest
and
consequent
trial
of
the
man
she
still
loves
in
spite
of
all
that
has
happened
to
separate
them
he
was
not
proof
against
this
new
responsibility
as
she
fainted
he
leaped
from
the
box
and
could
i
have
heard
the
words
he
muttered
in
her
ear
i
am
sure
that
i
should
have
that
to
give
you
which
would
settle
this
matter
for
all
time
as
it
is
i
can
only
say
that
my
own
convictions
are
absolute
the
rest
remains
with
you
we
will
go
see
the
man
said
district
attorney
fox
xxxvi
the
surcharged
moment
for
justice
when
triumphant
will
weep
down
pity
not
punishment
on
her
own
wrongs
too
much
avenged
by
those
who
err
i
wait
enduring
thus
the
retributive
hour
which
since
we
spake
is
even
nearer
now
the
moment
i
felt
sweetwater
hand
lifted
from
my
shoulder
i
sprang
into
the
first
hack
i
could
find
and
bade
the
driver
follow
the
cumberland
sleigh
i
was
determined
to
see
carmel
and
have
carmel
see
me
whatever
cold
judgment
might
say
against
the
meeting
i
could
not
live
in
my
present
anxiety
if
the
thunderbolt
which
had
struck
her
had
spared
her
life
and
reason
she
must
know
from
my
own
lips
that
i
was
not
only
a
free
man
but
as
innocent
of
the
awful
charge
conveyed
in
action
as
was
the
brother
who
had
just
been
acquitted
of
it
by
the
verdict
of
his
peers
i
must
declare
this
and
she
must
believe
me
nothing
else
mattered
nothing
else
in
all
the
world
that
arthur
might
stop
me
that
anything
could
stop
me
did
not
disturb
my
mind
for
a
minute
all
that
i
dreaded
was
that
i
might
find
myself
too
late
that
this
second
blow
might
have
proved
to
be
too
much
for
her
and
that
i
should
find
my
darling
dead
or
passed
from
me
into
that
living
death
which
were
the
harder
punishment
of
the
two
but
i
was
spared
this
killing
grief
when
our
two
conveyances
stopped
it
was
in
the
driveway
of
her
old
home
and
as
i
bounded
upon
the
walk
it
was
to
see
her
again
in
arthur
arms
but
this
time
with
open
eyes
and
features
carmel
rushed
in
a
cry
from
my
lips
do
believe
what
they
say
i
can
not
bear
it
i
can
not
bear
it
she
roused
she
looked
my
way
and
struggling
to
her
feet
held
back
arthur
with
one
hand
while
she
searched
my
face
and
possibly
searched
her
own
soul
for
answer
to
my
plea
never
was
moment
more
surcharged
further
word
i
could
not
speak
i
could
only
meet
her
eyes
with
the
steady
demanding
look
of
a
despairing
heart
while
arthur
moved
in
every
fibre
of
his
awakened
manhood
waited
thinking
perhaps
how
few
minutes
had
passed
since
he
hung
upon
the
words
of
a
fellow
being
for
his
condemnation
to
death
or
release
to
the
freedom
which
he
now
enjoyed
a
moment
but
what
an
eternity
before
i
saw
the
rigid
lines
of
her
white
set
face
relax
before
i
marked
the
play
of
human
if
not
womanly
emotion
break
up
the
misery
of
her
look
and
soften
her
youthful
lips
into
some
semblance
of
their
old
expression
love
might
be
dead
friendship
even
be
a
thing
of
the
far
past
but
consideration
was
still
alive
and
in
another
instant
it
spoke
in
these
trembling
sentences
uttered
across
a
threshold
made
sacred
by
a
tragedy
involving
our
three
lives
come
in
and
explain
yourself
no
man
should
go
unheard
i
know
you
will
not
come
where
adelaide
spirit
yet
lingers
if
you
can
not
bring
hands
clean
from
all
actual
violence
i
motioned
my
driver
away
and
as
carmel
drew
back
out
of
sight
i
caught
at
arthur
arm
and
faced
him
with
the
query
are
you
willing
that
i
should
enter
i
only
wish
to
declare
to
her
and
to
you
an
innocence
i
have
no
means
of
proving
but
which
you
can
not
disbelieve
if
i
swear
it
here
and
now
by
your
sister
carmel
sacred
disfigurement
such
depravity
could
not
exist
as
such
a
vow
from
the
lips
guilty
of
the
crime
you
charge
me
with
look
at
me
arthur
i
considered
you
now
consider
me
quickly
he
stepped
back
enter
said
he
it
was
some
minutes
later
i
can
not
say
how
many
that
one
of
the
servants
disturbed
us
by
asking
if
we
knew
anything
about
zadok
he
has
not
come
home
said
he
and
here
is
a
man
who
wants
him
what
man
asked
arthur
oh
that
detective
chap
he
never
will
leave
us
alone
i
arose
in
an
instant
enlightenment
had
come
to
me
it
nothing
said
i
with
my
eyes
on
carmel
but
the
gesture
i
furtively
made
arthur
said
otherwise
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
both
in
the
driveway
we
are
on
the
brink
of
a
surprise
i
whispered
i
think
i
understand
this
sweetwater
now
arthur
looked
bewildered
but
he
took
the
lead
in
the
interview
which
followed
with
the
man
who
had
made
him
so
much
trouble
and
was
now
doing
his
best
to
make
us
all
amends
zadok
could
not
be
found
he
was
wanted
by
the
district
attorney
who
wished
to
put
some
questions
to
him
were
there
any
objections
to
his
searching
the
for
indications
of
his
whereabouts
arthur
made
none
and
the
detective
after
sending
the
second
man
before
him
to
light
up
the
stable
disappeared
beneath
the
great
door
whither
we
more
slowly
followed
him
not
here
came
in
a
shout
from
above
as
we
stepped
in
from
the
night
air
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
detective
came
running
down
the
stairs
baffled
and
very
ill
at
ease
suddenly
he
encountered
my
eye
oh
i
know
he
cried
and
started
for
the
gate
i
am
going
to
follow
him
i
confided
to
arthur
look
for
me
again
or
at
least
expect
a
message
if
fortune
favours
us
as
i
now
expect
we
two
shall
sleep
as
we
have
not
slept
for
months
and
waiting
for
no
answer
not
even
to
see
if
he
comprehended
my
meaning
i
made
a
run
for
the
gate
and
soon
came
up
with
sweetwater
to
the
cemetery
i
asked
yes
to
the
cemetery
and
there
we
found
him
in
the
same
place
where
we
had
seen
him
before
but
not
in
the
same
position
he
was
sunken
now
to
the
ground
but
his
face
was
pressed
against
the
rails
and
in
his
stiff
cold
hand
was
clutched
a
letter
which
afterwards
we
read
let
it
be
read
by
you
here
it
will
explain
the
mystery
which
came
near
destroying
the
lives
of
more
than
adelaide
no
more
unhappy
wretch
than
i
goes
to
his
account
i
killed
her
who
had
shown
me
only
goodness
and
will
be
the
death
of
others
if
i
do
not
confess
my
dreadful
my
unsuspected
secret
this
is
how
it
happened
i
can
not
give
reasons
i
can
not
even
ask
for
pardon
that
night
just
as
i
was
preparing
to
leave
the
stable
to
join
the
other
servants
on
their
ride
to
tibbitt
hall
the
telephone
rang
and
i
heard
miss
cumberland
voice
zadok
she
said
and
at
first
i
could
hardly
understand
her
i
am
in
trouble
i
want
help
and
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
aid
me
answer
do
you
hear
me
and
are
you
quite
alone
in
the
stable
i
told
her
yes
and
that
i
was
listening
to
all
she
said
i
suspected
her
trouble
and
was
ready
to
stand
by
her
if
a
man
like
me
could
do
anything
i
had
been
with
her
many
years
and
i
loved
her
as
well
as
i
could
love
anybody
though
you
wo
think
it
when
i
tell
you
my
whole
story
what
she
wanted
was
this
i
was
to
go
to
the
ball
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
but
i
was
not
to
stay
there
as
soon
as
i
could
i
was
to
slip
out
get
a
carriage
from
some
stable
and
hurry
back
up
the
road
to
meet
her
and
take
her
where
she
would
tell
me
or
if
i
did
not
meet
her
to
wait
two
houses
below
hers
till
she
came
along
she
would
not
want
me
long
and
very
soon
i
could
go
back
and
have
as
good
a
time
as
i
pleased
but
she
would
like
me
to
be
secret
for
her
errand
was
not
one
for
gossip
even
among
her
own
servants
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
asked
me
to
do
anything
for
her
which
any
one
else
might
not
have
done
and
i
was
proud
of
her
confidence
and
happy
to
do
just
what
she
asked
i
even
tried
to
do
better
and
be
even
more
secret
about
it
than
she
expected
instead
of
going
to
a
stable
i
took
one
of
the
rigs
which
i
found
fastened
up
in
the
big
shed
alongside
the
hall
and
being
so
fortunate
as
not
to
attract
anybody
attention
by
this
business
i
was
out
on
the
road
and
half
way
to
the
whispering
pines
before
helen
and
maggie
could
wonder
why
i
had
not
asked
them
to
dance
a
few
minutes
later
i
was
on
the
hill
for
the
horse
i
had
chosen
was
a
fast
one
and
i
was
just
turning
into
our
street
when
i
was
passed
by
arthur
grey
mare
and
cutter
this
made
me
pull
up
for
a
minute
for
i
had
expected
this
but
on
looking
ahead
and
seeing
miss
cumberland
peering
from
our
own
gateway
i
drove
quickly
on
and
took
her
up
i
was
not
so
much
astonished
as
you
would
think
to
be
ordered
to
follow
fast
after
the
mare
and
cutter
and
to
stop
where
it
stopped
that
was
all
she
wanted
to
follow
that
cutter
and
to
stop
where
it
stopped
well
it
stopped
at
the
and
when
she
saw
it
turn
in
there
i
heard
her
give
a
little
gasp
wait
she
whispered
wait
till
she
has
had
time
to
get
out
and
go
in
then
drive
in
too
and
help
me
to
find
my
way
into
the
building
after
her
and
then
i
knew
it
was
miss
carmel
we
had
been
following
before
i
thought
it
was
arthur
presently
she
pulled
me
by
the
sleeve
i
heard
the
door
shut
said
she
and
i
was
a
little
frightened
at
her
voice
but
i
was
full
of
my
importance
and
went
on
doing
just
as
she
bade
me
driving
in
after
the
cutter
i
drew
up
into
the
shadows
where
the
grey
mare
was
hid
and
then
reaching
out
my
hand
to
miss
cumberland
i
helped
her
out
and
went
with
her
as
far
as
the
door
you
may
go
back
now
said
she
if
i
survive
the
night
i
shall
never
forget
this
service
my
good
zadok
and
i
saw
her
lift
her
hand
to
the
door
then
fall
back
white
and
trembling
in
the
moonlight
i
ca
she
whispered
over
and
over
i
ca
i
ca
shall
i
knock
i
asked
no
no
she
whispered
back
i
want
to
go
in
quietly
let
see
if
there
no
other
way
run
about
the
house
zadok
i
will
submit
to
any
humiliation
only
find
me
some
entrance
other
than
this
she
was
shaking
so
and
her
face
looked
so
ghastly
in
the
moonlight
that
i
was
afraid
to
leave
her
but
she
made
me
a
gesture
of
such
command
that
i
ran
quickly
down
the
steps
and
so
round
the
house
till
i
came
to
a
shed
over
the
top
of
which
i
saw
a
window
partly
open
could
i
get
her
up
on
to
the
shed
i
thought
i
could
and
went
hurrying
back
to
the
big
entrance
where
i
had
left
her
she
was
still
there
shivering
with
the
cold
but
just
as
determined
as
ever
come
i
whispered
i
have
found
a
way
she
gave
me
her
hand
and
i
led
her
around
to
the
shed
she
was
like
a
snow
woman
and
her
touch
was
ice
itself
wait
till
i
get
a
box
or
board
or
something
i
said
hunting
about
i
found
a
box
leaning
against
the
kitchen
side
and
bringing
it
i
helped
her
up
and
soon
had
her
on
a
level
with
the
window
as
she
made
her
way
in
she
turned
and
whispered
to
me
go
back
now
carmel
has
a
horse
and
will
see
me
home
you
have
served
me
well
zadok
i
nodded
and
she
vanished
into
the
darkness
then
i
should
have
gone
but
my
curiosity
was
too
great
i
wanted
to
know
just
a
little
more
two
women
in
this
desolate
and
bitterly
cold
what
did
it
mean
i
could
not
restrain
myself
from
following
her
in
and
listening
for
a
few
minutes
to
what
they
had
to
say
but
i
did
not
catch
much
of
it
and
when
i
heard
other
sounds
from
some
place
below
and
recognised
these
sounds
as
a
man
heavy
footsteps
coming
up
the
rear
stairs
i
got
a
fright
at
being
where
i
should
not
be
and
slipped
into
the
first
door
i
found
expecting
this
man
to
come
out
and
join
the
ladies
but
he
did
not
he
just
lingered
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
i
had
left
then
i
heard
him
clamber
out
of
the
window
and
go
i
now
know
that
this
was
arthur
but
i
did
not
know
it
then
and
i
was
frightened
for
the
horse
i
had
run
off
with
and
so
got
out
of
the
building
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
all
might
yet
have
been
well
if
i
had
not
found
lying
on
the
snow
at
the
foot
of
the
shed
a
bottle
of
whiskey
such
as
i
had
never
drunk
and
did
not
know
how
to
resist
catching
it
up
i
ran
about
the
house
to
where
i
had
left
my
rig
it
was
safe
and
in
my
relief
at
finding
it
i
knocked
off
the
head
of
the
bottle
and
took
a
long
drink
then
i
drank
again
then
i
sat
down
in
the
snow
and
drank
again
in
short
i
nearly
finished
it
then
i
became
confused
i
looked
at
the
piece
of
broken
bottle
in
my
hand
took
a
fancy
to
its
shape
and
breaking
off
a
bit
more
thrust
it
into
one
of
my
big
pockets
then
i
staggered
up
to
the
horse
but
i
did
not
untie
him
curiosity
seized
me
again
and
i
thought
i
would
take
another
look
at
the
ladies
perhaps
they
might
want
me
perhaps
i
was
pretty
well
confused
but
i
went
back
and
crawled
once
more
into
the
window
this
time
the
place
was
silent
not
a
sound
not
a
breath
but
i
could
see
a
faint
glimmer
of
light
i
followed
this
glimmer
still
there
was
no
sound
i
came
to
an
open
door
a
couch
was
before
me
heaped
with
cushions
a
long
ray
of
moonlight
had
shot
in
through
a
communicating
door
and
i
could
see
everything
by
it
this
was
where
the
ladies
had
been
when
i
listened
before
but
they
were
not
here
now
were
they
why
did
i
tremble
so
then
and
stare
and
stare
at
those
cushions
why
did
i
feel
i
must
pull
them
away
as
i
presently
did
i
was
mad
with
liquor
and
might
easily
have
imagined
what
i
there
saw
but
i
did
not
think
of
this
then
i
believed
what
i
saw
instantly
miss
cumberland
was
dead
and
i
had
discovered
the
crime
she
had
killed
herself
no
she
had
been
killed
should
i
yell
out
murder
no
no
i
could
be
sorry
without
that
i
would
not
yell
mistresses
were
plenty
i
had
liked
her
but
i
need
not
yell
there
was
something
else
i
could
do
she
had
a
ring
on
her
finger
a
ring
that
for
months
i
had
gloated
over
and
watched
as
i
had
never
watched
and
gloated
over
any
other
beautiful
thing
in
my
life
i
wanted
it
i
had
always
wanted
it
it
was
before
me
for
the
taking
now
i
should
be
a
fool
to
leave
it
there
for
some
other
wretch
to
pilfer
i
had
loved
her
i
would
love
the
ring
reaching
down
i
took
it
i
drew
it
from
her
finger
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
i
god
in
heaven
the
eyes
i
had
seen
glassed
in
death
were
looking
at
me
she
was
not
dead
she
had
been
witness
of
the
theft
without
a
thought
of
what
i
was
doing
my
hands
closed
round
her
throat
it
was
drink
fright
terror
at
the
look
she
gave
me
which
made
me
kill
her
not
my
real
self
my
real
self
could
have
shrieked
when
in
another
instant
i
saw
my
work
but
shrieking
would
not
bring
her
back
and
it
would
quite
ruin
me
miss
carmel
was
somewhere
near
i
heard
her
now
at
the
telephone
in
another
minute
she
would
come
out
and
meet
me
i
dared
not
linger
tossing
back
the
pillows
i
stumbled
from
the
place
why
i
was
not
heard
by
my
young
mistress
i
do
not
know
her
ears
were
deaf
just
as
my
eyes
were
in
a
half
hour
i
was
dancing
with
the
maids
telling
them
of
the
pretty
stranger
with
whom
i
had
been
sitting
out
an
hour
of
fun
in
a
quiet
corner
they
believed
me
and
not
a
particle
of
suspicion
has
any
man
ever
had
of
me
since
but
others
have
had
to
suffer
and
that
has
made
hell
of
my
nights
i
restored
the
ring
to
my
poor
mistress
but
even
that
brought
harm
to
one
i
had
no
quarrel
with
but
he
has
escaped
conviction
and
if
i
thought
ranelagh
would
also
escape
i
might
have
courage
to
live
out
my
miserable
life
and
seek
to
make
amends
in
the
way
she
would
have
me
but
i
fear
for
him
i
fear
for
miss
carmel
never
could
i
testify
in
another
trial
which
threatened
her
peace
of
mind
i
see
that
instead
of
being
the
selfish
stealer
of
her
sister
happiness
as
i
had
thought
she
is
an
angel
from
whom
