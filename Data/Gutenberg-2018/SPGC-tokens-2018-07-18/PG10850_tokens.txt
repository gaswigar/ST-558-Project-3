not

gentlemen
i
wonder
at
it
they
receiv
strict
charge
from
the
king
to
attend
here
besides
it
was
boldly
published
that
no
officer
should
forbid
any
gentlemen
that
desire
to
attend
and
hear
can
you
guess
the
cause
sir
it
is
plain
about
the
prince
that
come
to
marry
our
kingdoms
heir
and
be
our
soveraign
many
that
will
seem
to
know
much
say
she
looks
not
on
him
like
a
maid
in
love
o
sir
the
multitude
that
seldom
know
any
thing
but
their
own
opinions
speak
that
they
would
have
but
the
prince
before
his
own
approach
receiv
so
many
confident
messages
from
the
state
that
i
think
resolv
to
be
rul
sir
it
is
thought
with
her
he
shall
enjoy
both
these
kingdoms
of
and
sir
it
is
without
controversie
so
meant
but
be
a
troublesome
labour
for
him
to
enjoy
both
these
kingdoms
with
safetie
the
right
heir
to
one
of
them
living
and
living
so
vertuously
especially
the
people
admiring
the
bravery
of
his
mind
and
lamenting
his
injuries
who
philaster
yes
whose
father
we
all
know
was
by
our
late
king
of
unrighteously
deposed
from
his
fruitful
my
self
drew
some
blood
in
those
wars
which
i
would
give
my
hand
to
be
washed
from
sir
my
ignorance
in
will
not
let
me
know
why
being
heir
to
one
of
these
kingdoms
the
king
should
suffer
him
to
walk
abroad
with
such
free
liberty
sir
it
seems
your
nature
is
more
constant
than
to
enquire
after
state
news
but
the
king
of
late
made
a
hazard
of
both
the
kingdoms
of
and
his
own
with
offering
but
to
imprison
at
which
the
city
was
in
arms
not
to
be
charm
down
by
any
or
proclamation
till
they
saw
ride
through
the
streets
pleas
and
without
a
guard
at
which
they
threw
their
hats
and
their
arms
from
them
some
to
make
bonefires
some
to
drink
all
for
his
deliverance
which
wise
men
say
is
the
cause
the
king
labours
to
bring
in
the
power
of
a
foreign
nation
to
aw
his
own
with
galatea
megra
a
see
the
ladies
what
the
first
a
wise
and
modest
gentlwoman
that
attends
the
princess
the
second
she
is
one
that
may
stand
still
discreetly
enough
and
ill
dance
her
measure
simper
when
she
is
courted
by
her
friend
and
slight
her
husband
the
last
marry
i
think
she
is
one
whom
the
state
keeps
for
the
agents
of
our
confederate
princes
she
cog
and
lie
with
a
whole
army
before
the
league
shall
break
her
name
is
common
through
the
kingdom
and
the
trophies
of
her
dishonour
advanced
beyond
she
loves
to
try
the
several
constitutions
of
mens
bodies
and
indeed
has
destroyed
the
worth
of
her
own
body
by
making
experiment
upon
it
for
the
good
of
the
she
a
profitable
member
peace
if
you
love
me
you
shall
see
these
gentlemen
stand
their
ground
and
not
court
us
what
if
they
should
what
if
they
should
nay
let
her
alone
what
if
they
should
why
if
they
should
i
say
they
were
never
abroad
what
foreigner
would
do
so
it
writes
them
directly
untravel
why
what
if
they
be
what
if
they
be
good
madam
let
her
go
on
what
if
they
be
why
if
they
be
i
will
justifie
they
can
not
maintain
discourse
with
a
judicious
lady
nor
make
a
leg
nor
say
excuse
me
ha
ha
ha
do
you
laugh
madam
your
desires
upon
you
ladies
then
you
must
sit
beside
us
i
shall
sit
near
you
then
lady
near
me
perhaps
but
there
a
lady
indures
no
stranger
and
to
me
you
appear
a
very
strange
fellow
me
thinks
he
not
so
strange
he
would
quickly
be
acquainted
peace
the
king
king
pharamond
arethusa
to
give
a
stronger
testimony
of
love
than
sickly
promises
which
commonly
in
princes
find
both
birth
and
burial
in
one
breath
we
have
drawn
you
worthy
sir
to
make
your
fair
indearments
to
our
daughter
and
worthy
services
known
to
our
subjects
now
lov
and
wondered
at
next
our
intent
to
plant
you
deeply
our
immediate
heir
both
to
our
blood
and
kingdoms
for
this
lady
the
best
part
of
your
life
as
you
confirm
me
and
i
believe
though
her
few
years
and
sex
yet
teach
her
nothing
but
her
fears
and
blushes
desires
without
desire
discourse
and
knowledge
only
of
what
her
self
is
to
her
self
make
her
feel
moderate
health
and
when
she
sleeps
in
making
no
ill
day
knows
no
ill
dreams
think
not
dear
sir
these
undivided
parts
that
must
mould
up
a
virgin
are
put
on
to
shew
her
so
as
borrowed
ornaments
to
speak
her
perfect
love
to
you
or
add
an
artificial
shadow
to
her
nature
no
sir
i
boldly
dare
proclaim
her
yet
no
woman
but
woo
her
still
and
think
her
modesty
a
sweeter
mistress
than
the
offer
language
of
any
dame
were
she
a
queen
whose
eye
speaks
common
loves
and
comforts
to
her
servants
last
noble
son
for
so
i
now
must
call
you
what
i
have
done
thus
publick
is
not
only
to
add
a
comfort
in
particular
to
you
or
me
but
all
and
to
confirm
the
nobles
and
the
gentry
of
these
kingdoms
by
oath
to
your
succession
which
shall
be
within
this
month
at
most
this
will
be
hardly
done
it
must
be
ill
done
if
it
be
done
when
is
at
best
be
but
half
done
whilst
so
brave
a
gentleman
wrong
and
flung
off
i
fear
who
does
not
i
fear
not
for
my
self
and
yet
i
fear
too
well
we
shall
see

shall
see
no
more
kissing
your
white
hand

take
leave
to
thank
your
royal
father

your
subjects

be
for
so
deserving

dare
speak
my
self
to
what
a
person

what
eminence

expectation
of
what
faculties
manners
and
vertues
you
would
wed
your
kingdoms

in
me

your
wishes

but
through
the
travels
of
my
life

it
and
tye
it
to
this
country
and
i
vow
my
reign

be
so
easie

i
wonder
what
his
price
for

has
so
prais
his
shape
but
here

one
more
worthy
those
large
speeches

me
be
swallowed
quick
if
i
can
find
in
all
the
anatomy
of
yon
mans

sinew
sound
enough
to
promise
for
him
he
shall
be
constable
by

unless
it
be
for
trifles
in
my
poor
judgment

his
and

see
no
sun
shine
upon
any
but
thine

as
truly
valiant

among
the
choicest
of
his
friends
such
as
would
blush
to
talk
such
serious
follies
or
back
such
bellied
commendations
and
from
this
present
spight
of
all
these
bugs
you

hear
further
from
me
sir
you
wrong
the

i
gave
you

worthiest
the
true
name
of
man
this

within
my
knowledge
i

my
broken
fortunes
my
want

i
every

has
not
a
soul
of
crystal
for
all
men
to
read
their
actions
through
mens
hearts
and
faces
are
so
far
asunder
that
they
hold
no
intelligence
do
but
view
yon
stranger
well
and
you
shall
see
a
feaver
through
all
his
bravery
and
feel
him
shake
like
a
true
tenant
if
he
give
not
back
his
crown
again
upon
the
report
of
an
elder
gun
i
have
no
augury
go
to
be
more
your

a
kings
heir

me
be
a
king
and
whispers
to
me
these
be
all
my
subjects
is
strange
he
will
not
let
me

dives
into
my
fancy
and
there
gives
me
shapes
that
kneel
and
do
me
service

and
bravely
what
a
dangerous
train
did
he
give
fire
to
how
he

his
soul

you

but
do
you
weigh
the
danger
you
are
in
danger
in
a
sweet
face
by
i
must
not
fear
a
woman
but
are
you
sure
it
was
the
princess
sent
it
may
be
some
foul
train
to
catch
your
life
i
do
not
think
it
gentlemen
she
noble
her
eye
may
shoot
me
dead
or
those
true
red
and
white
friends
in
her
face
may
steal
my
soul
out
there
all
the
danger

but

arethusa
lady
comes
he
not
madam
will
come
dear
madam
you
were
wont
to
credit
me
at
first
but
didst
thou
tell
me
so
i
am
forgetful
and
my
womans
strength
is
so
with
danger
like
to
grow
about
my
marriage
that
these
dare
not
abide
in
such
a
troubled
sea
how
he
when
he
told
thee
he
would
come
why
well
and
not
a
little
fearful
fear
madam
sure
he
knows
not
what
it
is
you
are
all
of
his
faction
the
whole
court
is
bold
in
praise
of
him
whilst
i
may
live
neglected
and
do
noble
things
as
fools
in
strife
throw
gold
into
the
sea
drown
in
the
doing
but
i
know
he
fears
fear
madam
me
thought
his
looks
hid
more
of
love
than
fear
of
love
to
whom
to
you
did
you
deliver
those
plain
words
i
sent
with
such
a
winning
gesture
and
quick
look
that
you
have
caught
him
madam
i
mean
to
you
of
love
to
me
alas
thy
ignorance
lets
thee
not
see
the
crosses
of
our
births
nature
that
loves
not
to
be
questioned
why
she
did
this
or
that
but
has
her
ends
and
knows
she
does
well
never
gave
the
world
two
things
so
opposite
so
contrary
as
he
and
i
am
if
a
bowl
of
blood
drawn
from
this
arm
of
mine
would
poyson
thee
a
draught
of
his
would
cure
thee
of
love
to
me
madam
i
think
i
hear
him
bring
him
in
you
gods
that
would
not
have
your
dooms
withstood
whose
holy
wisdoms
at
this
time
it
is
to
make
the
passion
of
a
feeble
maid
the
way
unto
your
justice
i
obey
phil
here
is
my
lord
oh
is
well
withdraw
your
self
madam
your
messenger
made
me
believe
you
wisht
to
speak
with
me
is
true
but
the
words
are
such
i
have
to
say
and
do
so
ill
beseem
the
mouth
of
woman
that
i
wish
them
said
and
yet
am
loth
to
speak
them
have
you
known
that
i
have
ought
detracted
from
your
worth
have
i
in
person
wrong
you
or
have
set
my
baser
instruments
to
throw
disgrace
upon
your
vertues
never
madam
you
why
then
should
you
in
such
a
publick
place
injure
a
princess
and
a
scandal
lay
upon
my
fortunes
fam
to
be
so
great
calling
a
great
part
of
my
dowry
in
question
madam
this
truth
which
i
shall
speak
will
be
foolish
but
for
your
fair
and
vertuous
self
i
could
afford
my
self
to
have
no
right
to
any
thing
you
wish
philaster
know
i
must
enjoy
these
kingdoms
madam
both
both
or
i
die
by
fate
i
die
if
i
not
calmly
may
enjoy
them
both
i
would
do
much
to
save
that
noble
life
yet
would
be
loth
to
have
posterity
find
in
our
stories
that
gave
his
right
unto
a
scepter
and
a
crown
to
save
a
ladies
longing
nay
then
hear
i
must
and
will
have
them
and
more
what
more
or
lose
that
little
life
the
gods
prepared
to
trouble
this
poor
piece
of
earth
withall
madam
what
more
turn
then
away
thy
face
no
do
i
can
not
endure
it
turn
away
my
face
i
never
yet
saw
enemy
that
lookt
so
dreadful
but
that
i
thought
my
self
as
great
a
basilisk
as
he
or
spake
so
horribly
but
that
i
thought
my
tongue
bore
thunder
underneath
as
much
as
his
nor
beast
that
i
could
turn
from
shall
i
then
begin
to
fear
sweet
sounds
a
ladies
voice
whom
i
do
love
say
you
would
have
my
life
why
i
will
give
it
you
for
it
is
of
me
a
thing
so
loath
and
unto
you
that
ask
of
so
poor
use
that
i
shall
make
no
price
if
you
intreat
i
will
hear
yet
for
my
sake
a
little
bend
thy
looks
i
do
then
know
i
must
have
them
and
thee
and
me
thy
love
without
which
all
the
land
discovered
yet
will
serve
me
for
no
use
but
to
be
buried
in
possible
with
it
it
were
too
little
to
bestow
on
thee
now
though
thy
breath
doth
strike
me
dead
which
know
it
may
i
have
unript
my
breast
madam
you
are
too
full
of
noble
thoughts
to
lay
a
train
for
this
contemned
life
which
you
may
have
for
asking
to
suspect
were
base
where
i
deserve
no
ill
love
you
by
all
my
hopes
i
do
above
my
life
but
how
this
passion
should
proceed
from
you
so
violently
would
amaze
a
man
that
would
be
jealous
another
soul
into
my
body
shot
could
not
have
fill
me
with
more
strength
and
spirit
than
this
thy
breath
but
spend
not
hasty
time
in
seeking
how
i
came
thus
is
the
gods
the
gods
that
make
me
so
and
sure
our
love
will
be
the
nobler
and
the
better
blest
in
that
the
secret
justice
of
the
gods
is
mingled
with
it
let
us
leave
and
kiss
lest
some
unwelcome
guest
should
fall
betwixt
us
and
we
should
part
without
it
be
ill
i
should
abide
here
long
is
true
and
worse
you
should
come
often
how
shall
we
devise
to
hold
intelligence
that
our
true
lovers
on
any
new
occasion
may
agree
what
path
is
best
to
tread
i
have
a
boy
sent
by
the
gods
i
hope
to
this
intent
not
yet
seen
in
the
court
hunting
the
buck
i
found
him
sitting
by
a
fountain
side
of
which
he
borrow
some
to
quench
his
thirst
and
paid
the
nymph
again
as
much
in
tears
a
garland
lay
him
by
made
by
himself
of
many
several
flowers
bred
in
the
bay
stuck
in
that
mystick
order
that
the
rareness
delighted
me
but
ever
when
he
turned
his
tender
eyes
upon
he
would
weep
as
if
he
meant
to
make
grow
again
seeing
such
pretty
helpless
innocence
dwell
in
his
face
i
ask
him
all
his
story
he
told
me
that
his
parents
gentle
dyed
leaving
him
to
the
mercy
of
the
fields
which
gave
him
roots
and
of
the
crystal
springs
which
did
not
stop
their
courses
and
the
sun
which
still
he
thank
him
yielded
him
his
light
then
took
he
up
his
garland
and
did
shew
what
every
flower
as
country
people
hold
did
signifie
and
how
all
ordered
thus
exprest
his
grief
and
to
my
thoughts
did
read
the
prettiest
lecture
of
his
country
art
that
could
be
wisht
so
that
me
thought
i
could
have
studied
it
i
gladly
entertain
him
who
was
glad
to
follow
and
have
got
the
trustiest
and
the
gentlest
boy
that
ever
master
kept
him
will
i
send
to
wait
on
you
and
bear
our
hidden
love
lady
is
well
no
more
madam
the
prince
is
come
to
do
his
service
what
will
you
do
with
your
self
why
that
which
all
the
gods
have
appointed
out
for
me
dear
hide
thy
self
bring
in
the
prince
hide
me
from
when
thunder
speaks
which
is
the
voice
of
though
i
do
reverence
yet
i
hide
me
not
and
shall
a
stranger
prince
have
leave
to
brag
unto
a
forreign
nation
that
he
made
hide
himself
he
can
not
know
it
though
it
should
sleep
for
ever
to
the
world
it
is
a
simple
sin
to
hide
my
self
which
will
for
ever
on
my
conscience
lie
then
good
give
him
scope
and
way
in
what
he
saies
for
he
is
apt
to
speak
what
you
are
loth
to
hear
for
my
sake
do
i
will
pharamond
my
princely
mistress
as
true
lovers
ought
i
come
to
kiss
these
fair
hands
and
to
shew
in
outward
ceremonies
the
dear
love
writ
in
my
heart
if
i
shall
have
an
answer
no
directlier
i
am
gone
to
what
would
he
have
an
answer
to
his
claim
unto
the
kingdom
sirrah
i
forbear
you
before
the
king
good
sir
do
so
still
i
would
not
talk
with
you
but
now
the
time
is
fitter
do
but
offer
to
make
mention
of
right
to
any
kingdom
though
it
be
scarce
habitable
good
sir
let
me
go
and
by
my
sword
peace
if
thou
leave
us
philaster
i
have
done
you
are
gone
by
heaven
fetch
you
back
you
shall
not
need
what
now
know
pharamond
i
loath
to
brawl
with
such
a
blast
as
thou
who
art
nought
but
a
valiant
voice
but
if
thou
shalt
provoke
me
further
men
shall
say
thou
wert
and
not
lament
it
do
you
slight
my
greatness
so
and
in
the
chamber
of
the
princess
it
is
a
place
to
which
i
must
confess
i
owe
a
reverence
but
the
church
i
at
the
altar
there
no
place
so
safe
where
thou
injure
me
but
i
dare
kill
thee
and
for
your
greatness
know
sir
i
can
grasp
you
and
your
greatness
thus
thus
into
nothing
give
not
a
word
not
a
word
back
farewell
phi
is
an
odd
fellow
madam
we
must
stop
his
mouth
with
some
office
when
we
are
married
you
were
best
make
him
your
controuler
i
think
he
would
discharge
it
well
but
madam
i
hope
our
hearts
are
knit
and
yet
so
slow
the
ceremonies
of
state
are
that
be
long
before
our
hands
be
so
if
then
you
please
being
agreed
in
heart
let
us
not
wait
for
dreaming
for
me
but
take
a
little
stoln
delights
and
so
prevent
our
joyes
to
come
if
you
dare
speak
such
thoughts
i
must
withdraw
in
honour
are
the
constitution
of
my
body
will
never
hold
out
till
the
wedding
i
must
seek
elsewhere
pha
secundus
scena
philaster
bellario
and
thou
shalt
find
her
honourable
boy
full
of
regard
unto
thy
tender
youth
for
thine
own
modesty
and
for
my
sake
apter
to
give
than
thou
wilt
be
to
ask
i
or
deserve
sir
you
did
take
me
up
when
i
was
nothing
and
only
yet
am
something
by
being
yours
you
trusted
me
unknown
and
that
which
you
are
apt
to
conster
a
simple
innocence
in
me
perhaps
might
have
been
craft
the
cunning
of
a
boy
hardened
in
lies
and
theft
yet
ventur
you
to
part
my
miseries
and
me
for
which
i
never
can
expect
to
serve
a
lady
that
bears
more
honour
in
her
breast
than
you
but
boy
it
will
prefer
thee
thou
art
young
and
bearest
a
childish
overflowing
love
to
them
that
clap
thy
cheeks
and
speak
thee
fair
yet
but
when
thy
judgment
comes
to
rule
those
passions
thou
wilt
remember
best
those
careful
friends
that
plac
thee
in
the
noblest
way
of
life
she
is
a
princess
i
prefer
thee
to
in
that
small
time
that
i
have
seen
the
world
i
never
knew
a
man
hasty
to
part
with
a
servant
he
thought
trusty
i
remember
my
father
would
prefer
the
boys
he
kept
to
greater
men
than
he
but
did
it
not
till
they
were
grown
too
sawcy
for
himself
why
gentle
boy
i
find
no
fault
at
all
in
thy
behaviour
sir
if
i
have
made
a
fault
of
ignorance
instruct
my
youth
i
shall
be
willing
if
not
apt
to
learn
age
and
experience
will
adorn
my
mind
with
larger
knowledge
and
if
i
have
done
a
wilful
fault
think
me
not
past
all
hope
for
once
what
master
holds
so
strict
a
hand
over
his
boy
that
he
will
part
with
him
without
one
warning
let
me
be
corrected
to
break
my
stubbornness
if
it
be
so
rather
than
turn
me
off
and
i
shall
mend
thy
love
doth
plead
so
prettily
to
stay
that
trust
me
i
could
weep
to
part
with
thee
alas
i
do
not
turn
thee
off
thou
knowest
it
is
my
business
that
doth
call
thee
hence
and
when
thou
art
with
her
thou
with
me
think
so
and
is
so
and
when
time
is
full
that
thou
hast
well
discharged
this
heavy
trust
laid
on
so
weak
a
one
i
will
again
with
joy
receive
thee
as
i
live
i
will
nay
weep
not
gentle
boy
is
more
than
time
thou
didst
attend
the
princess
i
am
gone
but
since
i
am
to
part
with
you
my
lord
and
none
knows
whether
i
shall
live
to
do
more
service
for
you
take
this
little
prayer
heaven
bless
your
loves
your
fights
all
your
designs
may
sick
men
if
they
have
your
wish
be
well
and
heavens
hate
those
you
curse
though
i
be
one
the
love
of
boyes
unto
their
lords
is
strange
i
have
read
wonders
of
it
yet
this
boy
for
my
sake
if
a
man
may
judge
by
looks
and
speech
would
story
i
may
see
a
day
to
pay
him
for
his
loyalty
phi
pharamond
why
should
these
ladies
stay
so
long
they
must
come
this
way
i
know
the
queen
imployes
not
for
the
reverend
mother
sent
me
word
they
would
all
be
for
the
garden
if
they
should
all
prove
honest
now
i
were
in
a
fair
taking
i
was
never
so
long
without
sport
in
my
life
and
in
my
conscience
is
not
my
fault
oh
for
our
country
ladies
here
one
boulted
hound
at
her
galatea
your
grace
shall
i
not
be
a
trouble
not
to
me
sir
nay
nay
you
are
too
quick
by
this
sweet
hand

forsworn
sir

but
an
old
glove

you
will
talk
at
distance
i
am
for
you
but
good
prince

not
bawdy
nor
do
not
brag
these
two
i
bar
and

think

shall
have
sence
enough
to
answer
all
the
weighty
your
royal
blood
shall
manage
dear
lady
can
you
love
dear
prince
how
dear
i
ne
cost
you
a
coach
yet
nor
put
you
to
the
dear
repentance
of
a
banquet
here
no
scarlet
sir
to
blush
the
sin
out
it
was
given
for
this
wyer
mine
own
hair
covers
and
this
face
has
been
so
far
from
being
dear
to
any
that
it
ne
cost
penny
painting
and
for
the
rest
of
my
poor
wardrobe
such
as
you
see
it
leaves
no
hand
behind
it
to
make
the
jealous
mercers
wife
curse
our
good
doings
you
mistake
me
lady
lord
i
do
so
would
you
or
i
could
help

of
this
country

to
give
no
more
respect
to
men
of
my
full
being
full
being
i
understand
you
not
unless
your
grace
means
growing
to
fatness
and
then
your
only
remedy
upon
my
knowledge
prince
is
in
a
morning
a
cup
of
neat
brew
with
then
fast
till
supper
about
eight
you
may
eat
use
exercise
and
keep
a
you
can
shoot
in
a
tiller
but
of
all
your
grace
must
flie
fresh
pork
conger
and
clarified
whay
they
are
all
dullers
of
the
vital
spirits
lady

of
nothing

very
true

of

smooth
young

ripe
enough

wrongs

two
twin
cherries
died
in
blushes
which
those
fair
suns
above
with
their
bright
beams
reflect
upon
and
ripen
sweetest
beauty
bow
down
those
branches
that
the
longing
taste
of
the
faint
looker
on

meet
those
blessings
and
taste
and
live
o
delicate
sweet
prince
she
that
hath
snow
enough
about
her
heart
to
take
the
wanton
spring
of
ten
such
lines

be
a
nun
without
probation
sir

such
neat
poetry

a
kiss

begging
blanks

print
all
tongues
shall
speak
it
as
they
do
the
language
they
are
born
in
as
free
and
commonly
set
it
like
a
prodigious
star
for
all
to
gaze
at
and
so
high
and
glowing
that
other
kingdoms
far
and
forreign
shall
read
it
there
nay
travel
with
it
till
they
find
no
tongue
to
make
it
more
nor
no
more
people
and
then
behold
the
fall
of
your
fair
princess
has
she
a
boy
so
please
your
grace
i
have
seen
a
boy
wait
on
her
a
fair
boy
go
get
you
to
your
quarter
for
this
time
study
to
forget
you
do
you
study
to
forget
me
and
study
to
forget
you
king
meg
guard
why
here
a
male
spirit
for
if
ever
there
be
nine
worthies
of
women
this
wench
shall
ride
astride
and
be
their
captain
sure
she
hath
a
garrison
of
devils
in
her
tongue
she
uttereth
such
balls
of
she
has
so
netled
the
king
that
all
the
doctors
in
the
country
will
scarce
cure
him
that
boy
was
a
strange
found
out
antidote
to
cure
her
infection
that
boy
that
princess
boy
that
brave
chast
vertuous
ladies
boy
and
a
fair
boy
a
well
spoken
boy
all
these
considered
can
make
nothing
else
but
there
i
leave
you
gentlemen
nay
go
wander
with
you
tertius
scena
di
nay
doubtless
is
true
i
and
is
the
gods
that
rais
this
punishment
to
scourge
the
king
with
his
own
issue
is
it
not
a
shame
for
us
that
should
write
noble
in
the
land
for
us
that
should
be
freemen
to
behold
a
man
that
is
the
bravery
of
his
age
prest
down
from
his
royal
right
by
this
regardless
king
and
only
look
and
see
the
scepter
ready
to
be
cast
into
the
hands
of
that
lascivious
lady
that
lives
in
lust
with
a
smooth
boy
now
to
be
married
to
yon
strange
prince
who
but
that
people
please
to
let
him
be
a
prince
is
born
a
slave
in
that
which
should
be
his
most
noble
part
his
mind
that
man
that
would
not
stir
with
you
to
aid
let
the
gods
forget
that
such
a
creature
walks
upon
the
earth
is
too
backward
i
himself
the
gentry
do
await
it
and
the
people
against
their
nature
are
all
bent
for
him
and
like
a
field
of
standing
corn
that
with
a
stiff
gale
their
heads
bow
all
one
way
the
only
cause
that
draws
back
from
this
attempt
is
the
fair
princess
love
which
he
admires
and
we
can
now
confute
perhaps
not
believe
it
why
gentlemen
is
without
question
so
i
is
past
speech
she
lives
dishonestly
but
how
shall
we
if
he
be
curious
work
upon
his
faith
we
all
are
satisfied
within
our
selves
since
it
is
true
and
tends
to
his
own
good
make
this
new
report
to
be
my
knowledge
say
i
know
it
nay
swear
i
saw
it
it
will
be
best
move
him
philaster
here
he
comes
good
morrow
to
your
honour
we
have
spent
some
time
in
seeking
you
my
worthy
friends
you
that
can
keep
your
memories
to
know
your
friend
in
miseries
and
can
not
frown
on
men
disgrac
for
vertue
a
good
day
attend
you
all
what
service
may
i
do
worthy
your
acceptation
my
good
lord
we
come
to
urge
that
vertue
which
we
know
lives
in
your
breast
forth
rise
and
make
a
head
the
nobles
and
the
people
are
all
with
this
usurping
king
and
not
a
man
that
ever
heard
the
word
or
knew
such
a
thing
as
vertue
but
will
second
your
attempts
how
honourable
is
this
love
in
you
to
me
that
have
deserv
none
know
my
friends
you
that
were
born
to
shame
your
poor
with
too
much
courtesie
i
could
afford
to
melt
my
self
in
thanks
but
my
designs
are
not
yet
ripe
suffice
it
that
ere
long
i
shall
imploy
your
loves
but
yet
the
time
is
short
of
what
i
would
the
time
is
fuller
sir
than
you
expect
that
which
hereafter
will
not
perhaps
be
by
violence
may
now
be
caught
as
for
the
king
you
know
the
people
have
long
hated
him
but
now
the
princess
whom
they
lov
why
what
of
her
is
loath
as
much
as
he
by
what
strange
means
she
known
a
whore
thou
lyest
my
lord
thou
lyest
to
draw
and
is
and
thou
shalt
feel
it
i
had
thought
thy
mind
had
been
of
honour
thus
to
rob
a
lady
of
her
good
name
is
an
infectious
sin
not
to
be
pardon
be
it
false
as
hell
never
be
redeem
if
it
be
sown
amongst
the
people
fruitful
to
increase
all
evil
they
shall
hear
let
me
alone
that
i
may
cut
off
falshood
whilst
it
springs
set
hills
on
hills
betwixt
me
and
the
man
that
utters
this
and
i
will
scale
them
all
and
from
the
utmost
top
fall
on
his
neck
like
thunder
from
a
cloud
this
is
most
strange
sure
he
does
love
her
i
do
love
fair
truth
she
is
my
mistress
and
who
injures
her
draws
vengeance
from
me
sirs
let
go
my
arms
nay
good
my
lord
be
patient
sir
remember
this
is
your
honour
friend
that
comes
to
do
his
service
and
will
shew
you
why
he
utter
this
i
ask
you
pardon
sir
my
zeal
to
truth
made
me
unmannerly
should
i
have
heard
dishonour
spoke
of
you
behind
your
back
untruly
i
had
been
as
much
distemper
and
enrag
as
now
but
this
my
lord
is
truth
o
say
not
so
good
sir
forbear
to
say
so
is
the
truth
that
all
womenkind
is
false
urge
it
no
more
it
is
impossible
why
should
you
think
the
princess
light
why
she
was
taken
at
it
is
false
o
heaven
is
false
it
can
not
be
can
it
speak
gentlemen
for
love
of
truth
speak
possible
can
women
all
be
damn
why
no
my
lord
why
then
it
can
not
be
and
she
was
taken
with
her
boy
what
boy
a
page
a
boy
that
serves
her
oh
good
gods
a
little
boy
i
know
you
him
my
lord
hell
and
sin
know
him
sir
you
are
deceiv
reason
it
a
little
coldly
with
you
if
she
were
lustful
would
she
take
a
boy
that
knows
not
yet
desire
she
would
have
one
should
meet
her
thoughts
and
knows
the
sin
he
acts
which
is
the
great
delight
of
wickedness
you
are
abus
and
so
is
she
and
i
how
you
my
lord
why
all
the
world
in
an
unjust
report
oh
noble
sir
your
vertues
can
not
look
into
the
subtil
thoughts
of
woman
in
short
my
lord
i
took
them
i
my
self
now
all
the
devils
thou
didst
flie
from
my
rage
would
thou
hadst
devils
ingendring
plagues
when
thou
didst
take
them
hide
thee
from
my
eyes
would
thou
hadst
taken
thunder
on
thy
breast
when
thou
didst
take
them
or
been
strucken
dumb
for
ever
that
this
foul
deed
might
have
slept
in
silence
have
you
known
him
so
ill
temper
never
before
the
winds
that
are
let
loose
from
the
four
several
corners
of
the
earth
and
spread
themselves
all
over
sea
and
land
kiss
not
a
chaste
one
what
friend
bears
a
sword
to
run
me
through
why
my
lord
are
you
so
mov
at
this
when
any
falls
from
vertue
i
am
distract
i
have
an
interest
i
but
good
my
lord
recal
your
self
and
think
what
best
to
be
done
i
thank
you
i
will
do
it
please
you
to
leave
me
consider
of
it
tomorrow
i
will
find
your
lodging
forth
and
give
you
answer
the
readiest
way
all
the
gods
direct
you
he
was
extream
impatient
it
was
his
vertue
and
his
noble
mind
di
cle
thra
i
had
forgot
to
ask
him
where
he
took
them
follow
him
o
that
i
had
a
sea
within
my
breast
to
quench
the
fire
i
feel
more
circumstances
will
but
fan
this
fire
it
more
afflicts
me
now
to
know
by
whom
this
deed
is
done
than
simply
that
is
done
and
he
that
tells
me
this
is
honourable
as
far
from
lies
as
she
is
far
from
truth
o
that
like
beasts
we
could
not
grieve
our
selves
with
that
we
see
not
bulls
and
rams
will
fight
to
keep
their
females
standing
in
their
sight
but
take
from
them
and
you
take
at
once
their
spleens
away
and
they
will
fall
again
unto
their
pastures
growing
fresh
and
fat
and
taste
the
waters
of
the
springs
as
sweet
as
was
before
finding
no
start
in
sleep
but
miserable
man
see
see
you
gods
bellario
he
walks
still
and
the
face
you
let
him
wear
when
he
was
innocent
is
still
the
same
not
blasted
is
this
justice
do
you
mean
to
intrap
mortality
that
you
allow
treason
so
smooth
a
brow
i
can
not
now
think
he
is
guilty
health
to
you
my
lord
the
princess
doth
commend
her
love
her
life
and
this
unto
you
oh
now
i
perceive
she
loves
me
she
does
shew
it
in
loving
thee
my
boy
she
has
made
thee
brave
my
lord
she
has
attired
me
past
my
wish
past
my
desert
more
fit
for
her
attendant
though
far
unfit
for
me
who
do
attend
thou
art
grown
courtly
boy
o
let
all
women
that
love
black
deeds
learn
to
dissemble
here
here
by
this
paper
she
does
write
to
me
as
if
her
heart
were
mines
of
adamant
to
all
the
world
besides
but
unto
me
a
maiden
snow
that
melted
with
my
looks
tell
me
my
boy
how
doth
the
princess
use
thee
for
i
shall
guess
her
love
to
me
by
that
scarce
like
her
servant
but
as
if
i
were
something
allied
to
her
or
had
her
life
three
times
by
my
fidelity
as
mothers
fond
do
use
their
only
sons
as
use
one
that
left
unto
my
trust
for
whom
my
life
should
pay
if
he
met
harm
so
she
does
use
me
why
this
is
wondrous
well
but
what
kind
language
does
she
feed
thee
with
why
she
does
tell
me
she
will
trust
my
youth
with
all
her
loving
secrets
and
does
call
me
her
pretty
servant
bids
me
weep
no
more
for
leaving
you
see
my
services
regarded
and
such
words
of
that
soft
strain
that
i
am
nearer
weeping
when
she
ends
than
ere
she
spake
this
is
much
better
still
are
you
ill
my
lord
ill
no
me
thinks
your
words
fall
not
from
off
your
tongue
so
evenly
nor
is
there
in
your
looks
that
quietness
that
i
was
wont
to
see
thou
art
deceiv
boy
and
she
stroakes
thy
head
yes
and
she
does
clap
thy
cheeks
she
does
my
lord
and
she
does
kiss
thee
boy
ha
how
my
lord
she
kisses
thee
not
so
my
lord
come
come
i
know
she
does
no
by
my
life
why
then
she
does
not
love
me
come
she
does
i
had
her
do
it
i
charg
her
by
all
charms
of
love
between
us
by
the
hope
of
peace
we
should
enjoy
to
yield
thee
all
delights
naked
as
to
her
bed
i
took
her
oath
thou
enjoy
her
tell
me
gentle
boy
is
she
not
paralleless
is
not
her
breath
sweet
as
winds
when
fruits
are
ripe
are
not
her
breasts
two
liquid
ivory
balls
is
she
not
all
a
lasting
mine
of
joy
i
now
i
see
why
my
disturbed
thoughts
were
so
perplext
when
first
i
went
to
her
my
heart
held
augury
you
are
abus
some
villain
has
abus
you
i
do
see
whereto
you
tend
fall
rocks
upon
his
head
that
put
this
to
you
is
some
subtil
train
to
bring
that
noble
frame
of
yours
to
nought
thou
i
will
be
angry
with
thee
come
thou
shalt
know
all
my
drift
i
hate
her
more
than
i
love
happiness
and
plac
thee
there
to
pry
with
narrow
eyes
into
her
deeds
hast
thou
discover
is
she
fain
to
lust
as
i
would
wish
her
speak
some
comfort
to
me
my
lord
you
did
mistake
the
boy
you
sent
had
she
the
lust
of
sparrows
or
of
goats
had
she
a
sin
that
way
hid
from
the
world
beyond
the
name
of
lust
i
would
not
aid
her
base
desires
but
what
i
came
to
know
as
servant
to
her
i
would
not
reveal
to
make
my
life
last
ages
oh
my
heart
this
is
a
salve
worse
than
the
main
disease
tell
me
thy
thoughts
for
i
will
know
the
least
that
dwells
within
thee
or
will
rip
thy
heart
to
know
it
i
will
see
thy
thoughts
as
plain
as
i
do
know
thy
face
why
so
you
do
she
is
for
ought
i
know
by
all
the
gods
as
chaste
as
ice
but
were
she
foul
as
hell
and
i
did
know
it
thus
the
breath
of
kings
the
points
of
swords
tortures
nor
bulls
of
brass
should
draw
it
from
me
then
is
no
time
to
dally
with
thee
i
will
take
thy
life
for
i
do
hate
thee
i
could
curse
thee
now
if
you
do
hate
you
could
not
curse
me
worse
the
gods
have
not
a
punishment
in
store
greater
for
me
than
is
your
hate
fie
fie
so
young
and
so
dissembling
tell
me
when
and
where
thou
di
d
st
enjoy
her
or
let
plagues
fall
on
me
if
i
destroy
thee
not
heaven
knows
i
never
did
and
when
i
lie
to
save
my
life
may
i
live
long
and
loath
hew
me
asunder
and
whilst
i
can
think
love
those
pieces
you
have
cut
away
better
than
those
that
grow
and
kiss
these
limbs
because
you
made
so
fearest
thou
not
death
can
boys
contemn
that
oh
what
boy
is
he
can
be
content
to
live
to
be
a
man
that
sees
the
best
of
men
thus
passionate
thus
without
reason
oh
but
thou
dost
not
know
what
is
to
die
yes
i
do
know
my
lord
is
less
than
to
be
born
a
lasting
sleep
a
quiet
resting
from
all
jealousie
a
thing
we
all
pursue
i
know
besides
it
is
but
giving
over
of
a
game
that
must
be
lost
but
there
are
pains
false
boy
for
perjur
souls
think
but
on
these
and
then
thy
heart
will
melt
and
thou
wilt
utter
all
may
they
fall
all
upon
me
whilst
i
live
if
i
be
perjur
or
have
ever
thought
of
that
you
charge
me
with
if
i
be
false
send
me
to
suffer
in
those
punishments
you
speak
of
kill
me
oh
what
should
i
do
why
who
can
but
believe
him
he
does
swear
so
earnestly
that
if
it
were
not
true
the
gods
would
not
endure
him
rise
thy
protestations
are
so
deep
and
thou
dost
look
so
truly
when
thou
utterest
them
that
though
i
know
false
as
were
my
hopes
i
can
not
urge
thee
further
but
thou
wert
to
blame
to
injure
me
for
i
must
love
thy
honest
looks
and
take
no
revenge
upon
thy
tender
youth
a
love
from
me
to
thee
is
firm
what
ere
thou
dost
it
troubles
me
that
i
have
call
the
blood
out
of
thy
cheeks
that
did
so
well
become
thee
but
good
boy
let
me
not
see
thee
more
something
is
done
that
will
distract
me
that
will
make
me
mad
if
i
behold
thee
if
thou
me
let
me
not
see
thee
i
will
fly
as
far
as
there
is
morning
ere
i
give
distaste
to
that
most
honour
mind
but
through
these
tears
shed
at
my
hopeless
parting
i
can
see
a
world
of
treason
practis
upon
you
and
her
and
me
farewel
for
evermore
if
you
shall
hear
that
sorrow
struck
me
dead
and
after
find
me
loyal
let
there
be
a
tear
shed
from
you
in
my
memorie
and
i
shall
rest
at
peace
bel
blessing
be
with
thee
what
ever
thou

them
from
you
how
heaven
is
in
your
eyes
but
in
your
hearts
more
hell
than

how
your
tongues
like

and
poyson
how
your
thoughts
are
woven
with
thousand
changes
in
one
subtle
webb
and
worn
so
by
you
how
that
foolish
man
that
reads
the
story
of
a
womans
face
and
dies
believing
it
is
lost
for

how
all
the
good
you

is
but
a
shadow
morning
with
you
and
at
night
behind
you
past
and
forgotten
how
your
vows
are
frosts
fast
for
a
night
and
with
the
next
sun
gone
how
you
are
being
taken
all
together
a
meer
confusion
and
so
dead
a
that
love

these
sad
texts
till
my

to
utter
of
you
so

may
glory
in
the
ashes
of
a

by
her
passion

force
thee
to
that
which
shame

do
without

no
more
than
drops
to
seas
for
which
they
are
not

my

struck
his
anger
through
my
heart
and

truth
to
your
abused

may
know
your
worth
whilst
i
go
seek
out
some
forgotten
place
to

once
yet
if
i
had
another
to

talk
me
out
of
it
and

me

through
the
fiery
streets
lady

the
king

hunt
and

for
you
with
earnestness
i

in
tune
to

if
thou
canst
rage
with
a
maid
as
with
a
man

me
discover
thee
bathing
and
turn
me
to
a
fearful
hind
that
i
may
die

story
written

come
we
have
forgotten
your
venial
trespass
let
not
that
sit
heavy
upon
your
spirit
none
dare
utter
it
he
looks
like
an
old
surfeited
stallion
after
his
leaping
dull
as
a
dormouse
see
how
he
sinks
the
wench
has
shot
him
between
wind
and
water
and
i
hope
sprung
a
leak
he
needs
no
teaching
he
strikes
sure
enough
his
greatest
fault
is
he
hunts
too
much
in
the
purlues
would
he
would
leave
off
poaching
and
for
his
horn
has
left
it
at
the
lodge
where
he

well
done
hark
ye
further
possible
this
fellow
should
repent
me
thinks
that
were
not
noble
in
him
and
yet
he
looks
like
a
mortified
member
as
if
he
had
a
sick
mans
salve
in
mouth
if
a
worse
man
had
done
this
fault
now
some
physical
justice
or
other
would
presently
without
the
help
of
an
almanack
have
opened
the
obstructions
of
his
liver
and
let
him
bloud
with
a
see
see
how
modestly
your
lady
looks
as
if
she
came
from
churching
with
her
neighbour
why
what
a
devil
can
a
man
see
in
her
face
but
that
she
honest
troth
no
great
matter
to
speak
of
a
foolish
twinkling
with
the
eye
that
spoils
her
coat
but
he
must
be
a
cunning
herald
that
finds
it
see
how
they
muster
one
another
o
there
a
rank
regiment
where
the
devil
carries
the
colours
and
his
dam

now
the
world
and
the
flesh
come
behind
with
the
carriage
sure
this
lady
has
a
good
turn
done
her
against
her
will
before
she
was
common
talk
now
none
dare
say
cantharides
can
stir
her
her
face
looks
like
a
warrant
willing
and
commanding
all
tongues
as
they
will
answer
it
to
be
tied
up
and
bolted
when
this
lady
means
to
let
her
self
loose
as
i
live
she
has
got
her
a
goodly
protection
and
a
gracious
and
may
use
her
body
discreetly
for
her
healths
sake
once
a
week
excepting
lent
and
oh
if
they
were
to
be
got
for

what
a
great
sum
would
come
out
of

city
for
these

for
paying
ten
shillings
he
was
there
at
the
fall
of
a
deer
and
would
needs
out
of
his
mightiness
give
ten
groats
for
the
dowcers

the
steward

have
had
the
into
the
bargain
to
turf
his
hat
withal
i
think
he
should
love
venery
he
is
an
old
sir
for
if
you
be
remembred
he
forsook
the
stagg
once
to
strike
a
rascal
milking
in
a
medow
and
her
he
kill
in
the
eye
who
shoots
else
the
lady
that
a
good
wench
and
she
would
not
chide
us
for
tumbling
of
her
women
in
the
brakes
she
liberal
and
by
my
bow
they
say
she
honest
and
whether
that
be
a
fault
i
have
nothing
to
do
there
all
no
one
more
that
a
firker
boy
there

wench
will
ride

haunces
as
hard
after
a
kennel
of
hounds
as
a
and
when
she
comes
home
get
clapt
and
all
is
well
again
i
have
known
her
lose
her
self
three
times
in
one
afternoon
if
the
woods
had
been
answerable
and
it
has
been
work
enough
for
one
man
to
find
her
and
he
has
sweat
for
it
she
rides
well
and
she
payes
well
hark
let
go
philaster
oh
that
i
had
been
nourished
in
these
woods
with
milk
of
goats
and
acorns
and
not
known
the
right
of
crowns
nor
the
dissembling
trains
of
womens
looks
but
dig
my
self
a
cave
where
i
my
fire
my
cattel
and
my
bed
might
have
been
shut
together
in
one
shed
and
then
had
taken
me
some
mountain
girl
beaten
with
winds
chast
as
the
hardened
rocks
whereon
she
dwells
that
might
have
strewed
my
bed
with
leaves
and
reeds
and
with
the
skins
of
beasts
our
neighbours
and
have
born
at
her
big
breasts
my
large
course
issue
this
had
been
a
life
free
from
vexation
bellario
oh
wicked
men
an
innocent
man
may
walk
safe
among
beasts
nothing
assaults
me
here

my
griev
lord

as
his
soul
were
searching
out
a
way
to
leave
his
body

break
thy
last
commandment
for
i
must
speak
you
that

a
creature
yet
so
miserable
that
i
can
pity
oh
my
noble
lord
view
my
strange
fortune
and
bestow
on
me
according
to
your
bounty
if
my
service
can
merit
nothing
so
much
as
may
serve
to
keep
that
little
piece
i
hold
of
life
from
cold
and
hunger
is
it

sell
those
misbeseeming
cloaths
thou
and
feed
thy
self
with
them
alas
my
lord

the
silly
country
people
think
is
treason
to
touch
such
gay
things

by
my
life

is
unkindly
done
to
vex
me
with
thy
sight
fain
again
to
thy
dissembling
trade

thou
think
to
cozen
me
again
remains
there
yet
a
plague
untri
for
me
even
so
thou
and
when
first
i
took
thee
up
curse
on
the
time
if
thy
commanding
tears
can
work
on
any
other
use
thy
art
not
betray
it
which
way
wilt
thou
take
that
i
may
shun
thee
for
thine
eyes
are
poyson
to
mine
and
i
am
loth
to
grow
in
rage
this
way
or
that
way
any
will
serve

that
path
in

i
give
you
all
these
two
fair
the
noblest
of
the
mountain
where
they
grew
straightest
and
tallest
under
whose
still
shades
the
worthier
beasts
have
made
their
layers
and
slept
free
from
the
star
and
the
fell
free
from
the
clouds
when
they
were
big
with
humour
and
delivered
in
thousand
spouts
their
issues
to
the
earth
o
there
was
none
but
silent
quiet
there
till
never
pleas
fortune
shot
up
shrubs
base
under
brambles
to
divorce
these
branches
and
for
a
while
they
did
so
and
did
raign
over
the
mountain
and
choakt
up
his
beauty
with
brakes
rude
thornes
and
thistles
till
thy
sun
scorcht
them
even
to
the
roots
and
dried
them
there
and
now
a
gentle
gale
hath
blown
again
that
made
these
branches
meet
and
twine
together
never
to
be
divided
the
god
that
sings
his
holy
numbers
over
marriage
beds
hath
knit
their
noble
hearts
and
here
they
stand
your
children

done
how
how

no
masking
i
this
gentleman

prisoner
that
you
gave
me

my
keeper
and
through
all
the
bitter
throws
your
jealousies

his
ill
fate

wrought
him

the
first
that

you
you
must
get

it
hansomely
this
lady
i
will
sooner
trust
the
wind
with
feathers

aside
with
him
why
thou

face
my
lord
no
have
you
not
seen
it
nor
the
like
yes
i
have
seen
the
like
but
readily
i
know
not
where
i
have
been
often
told
in
court
of
one
a
lady
and
daughter
to
you
betwixt
whom
and
me
they
that
would
flatter
my
bad
face
would
swear
there
was
such
strange
resemblance
that
we
two
could
not
be
known
asunder
drest
alike
by
heaven
and
so
there
is
for
her
fair
sake
who
now
doth
spend
the
spring
time
of
her
life
in
holy
pilgrimage
move
to
the
king
that
i
may
scape
this
torture
but
thou
as
like
as
thou
dost
look
how
came
it
to
thy
knowledge
that
she
lives
in
pilgrimage
i
know
it
not
my
lord
but
i
have
heard
it
and
do
scarce
believe
it
oh
my
shame
possible
draw
near
that
i
may
gaze
upon
thee
art
thou
she
or
else
her
murderer
where
wert
thou
born
in
what
thy
name
o
is
just
is
she
now
i
do
know
thee
oh
that
thou
hadst
died
and
i
had
never
seen
thee
nor
my
shame
how
shall
i
own
thee
shall
this
tongue
of
mine
e
call
thee
daughter
more
would
i
had
died
indeed
i
wish
it
too
and
so
i
must
have
done
by
vow
e
published
what
i
have
told
but
that
there
was
no
means
to
hide
it
longer
yet
i
joy
in
this
the
princess
is
all
clear
what
have
you
done
all
is
discovered
why
then
hold
you
me
all
is
discovered
pray
you
let
me
go
he
offers
to
stab
stay
him
what
is
discovered
why
my
shame
it
is
a
woman
let
her
speak
the
rest
how
that
again
it
is
a
woman
blest
be
you
powers
that
favour

hold
upon
that
lady
it
is
a
woman
sir
hark
gentlemen
it
is
a
woman
take
my
soul
into
thy
breast
that
would
be
gone
with
joy
it
is
a
woman
thou
art
fair
and
vertuous
still
to
ages
in
despight
of
malice
speak
you
where
lies
his
shame
i
am
his
daughter
the
gods
are
just
i
dare
accuse
none
but
before
you
two
the
vertue
of
our
age
i
bend
my
knee
for
mercy
take
it
freely
for
i
know
though
what
thou
didst
were
undiscreetly
done
was
meant
well
and
for
me
i
have
a
power
to
pardon
sins
as
oft
as
any
man
has
power
to
wrong
me
noble
and
worthy
but
for
i
must
call
thee
still
so
tell
me
why
thou
didst
conceal
thy
sex
it
was
a
fault
a
fault
though
thy
other
deeds
of
truth
outweigh
it
all
these
jealousies
had
flown
to
nothing
if
thou
hadst
discovered
what
now
we
know
my
father
would
oft
speak
your
worth
and
vertue
and
as
i
did
grow
more
and
more
apprehensive
i
did
thirst
to
see
the
man
so
rais
but
yet
all
this
was
but
a
maiden
longing
to
be
lost
as
soon
as
found
till
sitting
in
my
window
printing
my
thoughts
in
lawne
i
saw
a
god
i
thought
but
it
was
you
enter
our
gates
my
bloud
flew
out
and
back
again
as
fast
as
i
had
puft
it
forth
and
it
in
like
breath
then
was
i
call
away
in
hast
to
entertain
you
never
was
a
man
heav
from
a
to
a
scepter
so
high
in
thoughts
as
i
you
left
a
kiss
upon
these
lips
then
which
i
mean
to
keep
from
you
for
ever
i
did
hear
you
talk
far
above
singing
after
you
were
gone
i
grew
acquainted
with
my
heart
and
what
stir
it
so
alas
i
found
it
love
yet
far
from
lust
for
could
i
have
but
in
presence
of
you
i
had
had
my
end
for
this
i
did
delude
my
noble
father
with
a
feign
pilgrimage
and
drest
my
self
in
habit
of
a
boy
and
for
i
knew
my
birth
no
match
for
you
i
was
past
hope
of
having
you
and
understanding
well
that
when
i
made
discovery
of
my
sex
i
could
not
stay
with
you
i
made
a
vow
by
all
the
most
religious
things
a
maid
could
call
together
never
to
be
known
whilst
there
was
hope
to
hide
me
from
mens
eyes
for
other
than
i
seem
that
i
might
ever
abide
with
you
then
sate
i
by
the
fount
where
first
you
took
me
up
search
out
a
match
within
our
kingdom
where
and
when
thou
wilt
and
i
will
pay
thy
dowry
and
thy
self
wilt
well
deserve
him
never
sir
will
i
marry
it
is
a
thing
within
my
vow
but
if
i
may
have
leave
to
serve
the
princess
to
see
the
vertues
of
her
lord
and
her
i
shall
have
hope
to
live
i
can
not
be
jealous
though
you
had
a
lady
drest
like
a
page
to
serve
you
nor
will
i
suspect
her
living
here
come
live
with
me
live
free
as
i
do
she
that
loves
my
lord
curst

the
wife
that

vertues
should
be
laid
in
earth
without
an
heir

me
my
royal
father
wrong
not
the
freedom
of
our
souls
so
much
to
think
to
take
revenge
of
that
base
woman

malice
can
not
hurt
us
set
her
free
as
she
was
born
saving
from
shame
and
sin

her
at
liberty
