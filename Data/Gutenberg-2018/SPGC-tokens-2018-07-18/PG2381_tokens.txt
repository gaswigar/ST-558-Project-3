thomas
tusser
it
came
without
warning
at
the
very
hour
his
hand
was
outstretched
to
crumple
the
holz
and
gunsberg
combine
the
new
york
doctors
called
it
overwork
and
he
lay
in
a
darkened
room
one
ankle
crossed
above
the
other
tongue
pressed
into
palate
wondering
whether
the
next
of
prickly
fires
would
drive
his
soul
from
all
anchorages
at
last
they
gave
judgment
with
care
he
might
in
two
years
return
to
the
arena
but
for
the
present
he
must
go
across
the
water
and
do
no
work
whatever
he
accepted
the
terms
it
was
capitulation
but
the
combine
that
had
shivered
beneath
his
knife
gave
him
all
the
honours
of
war
gunsberg
himself
full
of
condolences
came
to
the
steamer
and
filled
the
chapins
suite
of
cabins
with
overwhelming
smilax
said
george
chapin
when
he
saw
them
fitz
is
right
i
dead
only
i
do
see
why
he
left
out
the
memoriam
on
the
ribbons
nonsense
his
wife
answered
and
poured
him
his
tincture
you
be
back
before
you
can
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
mirror
surprised
that
his
face
had
not
been
branded
by
the
hells
of
the
past
three
months
the
noise
of
the
decks
worried
him
and
he
lay
down
his
tongue
only
a
little
pressed
against
his
palate
an
hour
later
he
said
sophie
i
feel
sorry
about
taking
you
away
from
everything
like
this
i
i
suppose
we
the
two
loneliest
people
on
god
earth
said
sophie
his
wife
and
kissed
him
is
it
something
to
you
that
we
going
together
they
drifted
about
europe
for
months
sometimes
alone
sometimes
with
chance
met
gipsies
of
their
own
land
from
the
north
cape
to
the
blue
grotto
at
capri
they
wandered
because
the
next
steamer
headed
that
way
or
because
some
one
had
set
them
on
the
road
the
doctors
had
warned
sophie
that
chapin
was
not
to
take
interest
even
in
other
interests
but
a
familiar
sensation
at
the
back
of
the
neck
after
one
hour
keen
talk
with
a
nauheimed
railway
magnate
saved
her
any
trouble
he
nearly
wept
and
i
over
thirty
he
cried
with
all
i
meant
to
do
let
call
it
a
honeymoon
said
sophie
d
you
know
in
all
the
six
years
we
been
married
you
never
told
me
what
you
meant
to
do
with
your
life
with
my
life
what
the
use
it
finished
sophie
looked
up
quickly
from
the
bay
of
naples
as
far
as
my
business
goes
i
shall
have
to
live
on
my
rents
like
that
architect
at
san
you
get
better
if
you
do
worry
and
even
if
it
rakes
time
there
are
worse
things
than
how
much
have
you
between
four
and
five
million
but
it
is
the
money
you
know
it
is
it
the
principle
how
could
you
respect
me
you
never
did
the
first
year
after
we
married
till
i
went
to
work
like
the
others
our
tradition
and
upbringing
are
against
it
we
ca
accept
those
well
i
suppose
i
married
you
for
some
sort
of
ideal
she
answered
and
they
returned
to
their
hotel
in
england
they
missed
the
alien
tongues
of
continental
streets
that
reminded
them
of
their
own
polyglot
cities
in
england
all
men
spoke
one
tongue
speciously
like
american
to
the
ear
but
on
unintelligible
ah
but
you
have
not
seen
england
said
a
lady
with
hair
they
had
met
her
in
vienna
bayreuth
and
florence
and
were
grateful
to
find
her
again
at
claridge
for
she
commanded
situations
and
knew
where
prescriptions
are
most
carefully
made
up
you
ought
to
take
an
interest
in
the
home
of
our
ancestors
as
i
i
tried
for
a
week
shonts
said
sophie
but
i
never
get
any
further
than
tipping
german
these
men
are
not
the
true
type
shouts
went
on
i
know
where
you
should
chapin
pricked
up
his
ears
anxious
to
run
anywhere
from
the
streets
on
which
quick
men
something
of
his
kidney
did
the
business
denied
to
him
we
hear
and
we
obey
shonts
said
sophie
feeling
his
unrest
as
he
drank
the
loathed
british
tea
shonts
smiled
and
took
them
in
hand
she
wrote
widely
and
telegraphed
far
on
their
behalf
till
armed
with
her
letter
of
introduction
she
drove
them
into
that
wilderness
which
is
reached
from
an
of
a
station
called
charing
cross
they
were
to
go
to
rockett
the
farm
of
one
cloke
in
the
southern
counties
where
she
assured
them
they
would
meet
the
genuine
england
of
folklore
and
song
rocketts
they
found
after
some
hours
four
miles
from
a
station
and
so
far
as
they
could
judge
in
the
bumpy
darkness
twice
as
many
from
a
road
trees
kine
and
the
outlines
of
barns
showed
shadowy
about
them
when
they
alighted
and
and
cloke
at
the
open
door
of
a
deep
kitchen
made
them
shyly
welcome
they
lay
in
an
attic
beneath
a
wavy
whitewashed
ceiling
and
because
it
rained
a
wood
fire
was
made
in
an
iron
basket
on
a
brick
hearth
and
they
fell
asleep
to
the
chirping
of
mice
and
the
whimper
of
flames
when
they
woke
it
was
a
fair
day
full
of
the
noises
of
birds
the
smell
of
box
lavender
and
fried
bacon
mixed
with
an
elemental
smell
they
had
never
met
before
this
said
sophie
nearly
pushing
out
the
thin
casement
in
an
attempt
to
see
round
the
corner
is
what
did
the
say
to
the
railway
porter
about
my
trunk
on
the
top
no
little
bit
of
all
right
i
feel
farther
away
from
anywhere
than
i
ever
felt
in
my
life
we
must
find
out
where
the
telegraph
office
who
cares
said
sophie
wandering
about
hairbrush
in
hand
to
admire
the
illustrated
weekly
pictures
pasted
on
door
and
cupboard
but
there
was
no
rest
for
the
alien
soul
till
he
had
made
sure
of
the
telegraph
office
he
asked
the
clokes
daughter
laying
breakfast
while
sophie
plunged
her
face
in
the
lavender
bush
outside
the
low
window
go
to
the
stile
o
the
barn
field
said
mary
and
look
across
pardons
to
the
next
spire
it
directly
under
you
ca
miss
it
not
if
you
keep
to
the
footpath
my
sister
the
telegraphist
there
but
you
in
the
radius
sir
the
boy
delivers
telegrams
directly
to
this
door
from
pardons
one
has
to
take
a
good
deal
on
trust
in
this
country
he
murmured
sophie
looked
at
the
close
turf
scarred
only
with
last
night
wheels
at
two
ruts
which
wound
round
a
rickyard
and
at
the
circle
of
still
orchard
about
the
house
what
the
matter
with
it
she
said
telegrams
delivered
to
the
vale
of
avalon
of
course
and
she
beckoned
in
an
hound
of
engaging
manners
and
no
engagements
who
answered
at
times
to
the
name
of
rambler
he
led
them
after
breakfast
to
the
rise
behind
the
house
where
the
stile
stood
against
the
skyline
and
i
wonder
what
we
shall
find
now
said
sophie
frankly
prancing
with
joy
on
the
grass
it
was
a
slope
of
fields
possessed
to
their
centres
by
clumps
of
brambles
gates
were
not
and
the
posts
leaned
out
and
in
a
narrow
path
doubled
among
the
bushes
scores
of
white
tails
twinkled
before
the
racing
hound
and
a
hawk
rose
whistling
shrilly
no
roads
no
nothing
said
sophie
her
short
skirt
hooked
by
briers
i
thought
all
england
was
a
garden
there
your
spire
george
across
the
valley
how
curious
they
walked
toward
it
through
an
all
abandoned
land
here
they
found
the
ghost
of
a
patch
of
lucerne
that
had
refused
to
die
there
a
harsh
fallow
surrendered
to
thistles
and
here
a
breadth
of
rampant
kelk
feigning
to
be
lawful
crop
in
the
ungrazed
pastures
swaths
of
dead
stuff
caught
their
feet
and
the
ground
beneath
glistened
with
sweat
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
a
little
brook
had
undermined
its
footbridge
and
frothed
in
the
wreckage
but
there
stood
great
woods
on
the
slopes
beyond
old
tall
and
brilliant
like
unfaded
tapestries
against
the
walls
of
a
ruined
house
all
this
within
a
hundred
miles
of
london
he
said
looks
as
if
it
had
had
nervous
prostration
the
footpath
turned
the
shoulder
of
a
slope
through
a
thicket
of
rank
rhododendrons
and
crossed
what
had
once
been
a
carriage
drive
which
ended
in
the
shadow
of
two
gigantic
a
house
said
sophie
in
a
whisper
a
colonial
house
behind
the
of
the
twin
trees
rose
a
brick
georgian
pile
with
a
over
its
pillared
door
the
hound
had
gone
off
on
his
own
foolish
quests
except
for
some
stir
it
the
branches
and
the
flight
of
four
startled
magpies
there
was
neither
life
nor
sound
about
the
square
house
but
it
looked
out
of
its
long
windows
most
friendlily
to
meet
you
i
sure
said
sophie
and
curtsied
to
the
ground
george
this
is
history
i
can
understand
we
began
she
curtsied
again
the
june
sunshine
twinkled
on
all
the
lights
it
was
as
though
an
old
lady
wise
in
three
generations
experience
but
for
the
present
sitting
out
bent
to
listen
to
her
flushed
and
eager
grandchild
i
must
look
sophie
tiptoed
to
a
window
and
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
oh
this
room
of
wool
i
suppose
but
i
can
see
a
bit
of
the
mantelpiece
george
do
come
is
that
some
one
she
fell
back
behind
her
husband
the
front
door
opened
slowly
to
show
the
hound
his
nose
white
with
milk
in
charge
of
an
ancient
of
days
clad
in
a
blue
linen
ephod
curiously
gathered
on
breast
and
shoulders
certainly
said
george
half
aloud
father
time
himself
this
is
where
he
lives
we
came
said
sophie
weakly
can
we
see
the
house
i
afraid
our
no
is
rambler
said
the
old
man
he
been
at
my
again
staying
at
rocketts
be
ye
come
in
ah
you
runagate
the
hound
broke
from
him
and
he
tottered
after
him
down
the
drive
they
entered
the
hall
just
such
a
high
light
hall
as
such
a
house
should
own
a
staircase
wide
and
shallow
and
once
climbed
out
of
it
under
a
long
oval
window
on
either
side
delicately
moulded
doors
gave
on
to
rooms
whose
mantelpieces
were
adorned
with
nymphs
scrolls
and
cupids
in
low
relief
what
the
firm
that
makes
these
things
cried
sophie
enraptured
oh
i
forgot
these
must
be
the
originals
adams
is
it
i
never
dreamed
of
anything
like
that
fender
does
he
mean
us
to
go
everywhere
he
catching
the
dog
said
george
looking
out
we
do
they
explored
the
first
or
ground
floor
delighted
as
children
playing
burglars
this
is
like
all
england
she
said
at
last
wonderful
but
no
explanation
you
expected
to
know
it
beforehand
now
let
try
the
stairs
never
creaked
beneath
their
feet
from
the
broad
landing
they
entered
a
long
room
lighted
by
three
windows
which
overlooked
the
forlorn
wreck
of
a
terraced
garden
and
wooded
slopes
beyond
the
of
sophie
swam
up
and
down
it
that
mantelpiece
orpheus
and
eurydice
is
the
best
of
them
all
is
it
marvellous
why
the
room
seems
furnished
with
nothing
in
it
that
george
it
the
proportions
i
noticed
i
saw
a
heppelwhite
couch
once
sophie
laid
her
finger
to
her
flushed
cheek
and
considered
with
two
of
them
one
on
each
side
you
need
anything
else
except
there
must
be
one
perfect
mirror
over
that
look
at
that
view
it
a
framed
constable
her
husband
cried
no
it
a
morland
a
parody
of
a
morland
but
about
that
couch
george
do
you
think
empire
might
be
better
than
heppelwhite
dull
gold
against
that
pale
green
it
a
pity
they
do
make
spinets
i
believe
you
can
get
them
look
at
that
oak
wood
behind
the
you
sat
and
played
toccatas
stately
at
the
clavichord
sophie
hummed
and
head
on
one
side
nodded
to
where
the
perfect
mirror
should
hang
then
they
found
bedrooms
with
and
and
steps
leading
up
and
down
boxes
of
rooms
round
square
and
octagonal
with
enriched
ceilings
and
chased
now
about
servants
oh
she
had
darted
up
the
last
stairs
to
the
chequered
darkness
of
the
top
floor
where
loose
tiles
lay
among
broken
laths
and
the
walls
were
scrawled
with
names
sentiments
and
hop
records
they
been
keeping
pigeons
here
she
cried
and
you
could
drive
a
buggy
through
the
roof
anywhere
said
george
that
what
i
say
the
old
man
cried
below
them
on
the
stairs
not
a
dry
place
for
my
pigeons
at
but
why
was
it
allowed
to
get
like
this
said
sophie
tis
with
housen
as
teeth
he
replied
let
go
too
far
and
nothing
to
be
done
time
was
they
was
minded
to
sell
her
but
none
would
buy
she
was
too
far
away
along
from
any
place
time
was
they
lived
here
theyselves
but
they
took
and
here
sophie
moved
beneath
the
light
of
a
hole
in
the
roof
nah
none
dies
here
excep
falling
off
ricks
and
such
in
london
they
he
plucked
a
lock
of
wool
from
his
blue
smock
they
was
no
staple
neither
the
elphicks
nor
the
moones
shart
and
brittle
all
of
dead
they
be
seventeen
year
for
i
been
here
who
does
all
the
wool
belong
to
downstairs
george
asked
to
the
estate
i
show
you
the
back
parts
if
ye
like
you
from
america
ai
ye
i
had
a
son
there
once
they
followed
him
down
the
main
stairway
he
paused
at
the
turn
and
swept
one
hand
toward
the
wall
plenty
room
here
for
your
coffin
to
come
down
seven
foot
and
three
men
at
each
end
would
brish
the
paint
if
i
die
in
my
bed
they
to
me
like
a
is
all
luck
dye
see
he
led
them
on
and
on
through
a
maze
of
back
kitchens
dairies
larders
and
sculleries
that
melted
along
covered
ways
into
a
visibly
older
than
the
main
building
which
again
rambled
out
among
barns
byres
stalls
and
stables
to
the
dead
fields
behind
somehow
said
sophie
sitting
exhausted
on
an
ancient
somehow
one
would
insult
these
lovely
old
things
by
filling
them
with
george
looked
at
long
stone
walls
upholding
reaches
of
buttresses
of
mixed
flint
and
bricks
outside
stairs
stone
upon
arched
stone
curves
of
thatch
where
grass
sprouted
roundels
of
tiles
and
a
huge
paved
yard
populated
by
two
cows
and
the
repentant
rambler
he
had
not
thought
of
himself
or
of
the
telegraph
office
for
two
and
a
half
hours
but
why
said
sophie
as
they
went
back
through
the
crater
of
stricken
fields
why
is
one
expected
to
know
everything
in
england
why
do
they
never
tell
you
mean
about
the
elphicks
and
the
moones
he
answered
yes
and
the
lawyers
and
the
estate
who
are
they
i
wonder
whether
those
painted
floors
in
the
green
room
were
real
oak
do
you
like
us
exploring
things
together
better
than
pompeii
george
turned
once
more
to
look
at
the
view
eight
hundred
acres
go
with
the
house
the
old
man
told
me
five
farms
altogether
rocketts
is
one
of
i
like
cloke
but
what
is
the
old
house
called
george
laughed
that
one
of
the
things
you
expected
to
know
he
never
told
the
clokes
were
more
communicative
that
evening
and
thereafter
for
a
week
they
gave
the
chapins
the
official
history
as
one
gives
it
to
lodgers
of
friars
pardon
the
house
and
its
five
farms
but
sophie
asked
so
many
questions
and
george
was
so
humanly
interested
that
as
confidence
in
the
strangers
grew
they
launched
with
observed
and
acquired
detail
into
the
lives
and
deaths
and
doings
of
the
elphicks
and
the
moones
and
their
collaterals
the
haylings
and
the
torrells
it
was
a
tale
told
serially
by
cloke
in
the
barn
or
his
wife
in
the
dairy
the
last
chapters
reserved
for
the
kitchen
o
nights
by
the
big
fire
when
the
two
had
been
half
the
day
exploring
about
the
house
where
old
iggulden
of
the
blue
smock
cackled
and
chuckled
to
see
them
the
motives
that
swayed
the
characters
were
beyond
their
comprehension
the
fates
that
shifted
them
were
gods
they
had
never
met
the
sidelights
cloke
threw
on
act
and
incident
were
more
amazing
than
anything
in
the
record
therefore
the
chapins
listened
delightedly
and
blessed
shonts
but
why
why
why
did
do
sophie
would
demand
from
her
seat
by
the
pothook
and
cloke
would
answer
smoothing
her
knees
for
the
sake
of
the
i
give
it
up
said
george
one
night
in
their
own
room
people
seem
to
matter
in
this
country
compared
to
the
places
they
live
in
the
way
she
tells
it
friars
pardon
was
a
sort
of
poor
old
thing
they
had
been
walking
round
the
farms
as
usual
before
tea
no
wonder
they
loved
it
think
of
the
sacrifices
they
made
for
it
jane
elphick
married
the
younger
torrell
to
keep
it
in
the
family
the
octagonal
room
with
the
moulded
ceiling
next
to
the
big
bedroom
was
hers
now
what
did
he
tell
you
while
he
was
feeding
the
pigs
said
sophie
about
the
torrell
cousins
and
the
uncle
who
died
in
java
they
lived
at
burnt
house
behind
high
pardons
where
that
brook
is
all
blocked
no
burnt
house
is
under
high
pardons
wood
before
you
come
to
gale
anstey
sophie
corrected
well
old
man
cloke
said
sophie
threw
open
the
door
and
called
down
into
the
kitchen
where
the
clokes
were
covering
the
fire
mrs
cloke
is
burnt
house
under
high
pardons
yes
my
dear
of
course
the
soft
voice
answered
absently
a
cough
i
beg
your
pardon
madam
what
was
it
you
said
never
mind
i
prefer
it
the
other
way
sophie
laughed
and
george
the
missing
chapter
as
she
sat
on
the
bed
here
an
gone
said
cloke
warningly
paid
their
first
month
but
we
only
that
shonts
letter
for
none
she
sent
never
cheated
us
yet
it
slipped
out
before
i
thought
she
a
most
humane
young
lady
they
be
going
away
in
a
little
you
talked
a
lot
too
yes
but
the
elphicks
are
all
dead
no
one
can
bring
my
loose
talking
home
to
me
but
why
do
they
stay
on
and
stay
on
so
in
due
time
george
and
sophie
asked
each
other
that
question
and
put
it
aside
they
argued
that
the
climate
a
pearly
blend
unlike
the
hot
and
cold
ferocities
of
their
native
land
suited
them
as
the
thick
stillness
of
the
nights
certainly
suited
george
he
was
saved
even
the
sight
of
a
metalled
road
which
as
presumably
leading
to
business
wakes
desire
in
a
man
and
the
telegraph
office
at
the
village
of
friars
pardon
where
they
sold
picture
and
pegtops
was
two
walking
miles
across
the
fields
and
woods
for
all
that
touched
his
past
among
his
fellows
or
their
remembrance
of
him
he
might
have
been
in
another
planet
and
sophie
whose
life
had
been
very
largely
spent
among
husbandless
wives
of
lofty
ideals
had
no
wish
to
leave
this
present
of
god
the
unhurried
meals
the
foreknowledge
of
deliciously
empty
hours
to
follow
the
breadths
of
soft
sky
under
which
they
walked
together
and
reckoned
time
only
by
their
hunger
or
thirst
the
good
grass
beneath
their
feet
that
cheated
the
miles
their
discoveries
always
together
amid
the
farms
griffons
rocketts
burnt
house
gale
anstey
and
the
home
farm
where
iggulden
of
the
blue
would
waylay
them
and
they
would
ransack
the
old
house
once
more
the
long
wet
afternoons
when
they
tucked
up
their
feet
on
the
bedroom
deep
over
against
the
and
talked
together
as
never
till
then
had
they
found
time
to
talk
these
things
contented
her
soul
and
her
body
throve
have
you
realized
she
asked
one
morning
that
we
been
here
absolutely
alone
for
the
last
days
have
you
counted
them
he
asked
did
you
like
them
she
replied
i
must
have
i
did
think
about
them
yes
i
have
six
months
ago
i
should
have
fretted
myself
sick
remember
at
cairo
i
only
had
two
or
three
bad
times
am
i
getting
better
or
is
it
senile
decay
climate
all
sophie
swung
her
english
boots
as
she
sat
on
the
stile
overlooking
friars
pardon
behind
the
barn
one
must
take
hold
of
things
though
he
said
if
it
only
to
keep
one
hand
his
eyes
did
not
flicker
now
as
they
swept
the
empty
fields
must
one
lay
out
a
morristown
links
over
gale
anstey
i
dare
say
you
could
hire
no
i
not
as
english
as
that
nor
as
morristown
cloke
says
all
the
farms
here
could
be
made
to
well
i
anastasia
in
the
of
franchard
i
content
to
be
alive
and
purr
there
no
he
smiled
all
the
same
i
going
to
see
after
my
you
promised
you
would
have
there
some
business
coming
through
that
amusing
me
honest
it
does
get
on
my
nerves
at
want
a
secretary
no
thanks
old
thing
is
that
quite
english
too
english
go
but
none
the
less
in
broad
daylight
she
returned
the
kiss
i
off
to
pardons
i
have
been
to
the
house
for
nearly
a
how
you
decided
to
furnish
jane
elphick
bedroom
he
laughed
for
it
had
come
to
be
a
permanent
castle
in
spain
between
them
black
chinese
furniture
and
yellow
silk
brocade
she
answered
and
ran
downhill
she
scattered
a
few
cows
at
a
gap
with
a
flourish
of
a
that
iggulden
had
cut
for
her
a
week
ago
and
singing
as
she
passed
under
the
holmoaks
sought
the
at
the
back
of
friars
pardon
the
old
man
was
not
to
be
found
and
she
knocked
at
his
door
for
she
needed
him
to
fill
her
idle
forenoon
a
a
new
friend
and
rambler
old
enemy
crawled
out
and
besought
her
to
enter
iggulden
sat
in
his
chair
by
the
fire
a
between
his
knees
his
head
drooped
though
she
had
never
seen
death
before
her
heart
that
missed
a
beat
told
her
that
he
was
dead
she
did
not
speak
or
cry
but
stood
outside
the
door
and
the
dog
licked
her
hand
when
he
threw
up
his
nose
she
heard
herself
saying
do
howl
please
do
begin
to
howl
scottie
or
i
shall
run
away
she
held
her
ground
while
the
shadows
in
the
rickyard
moved
toward
noon
sat
after
a
while
on
the
steps
by
the
door
her
arms
round
the
neck
waiting
till
some
one
should
come
she
watched
the
smokeless
chimneys
of
friars
pardon
slash
its
roofs
with
shadow
and
the
smoke
of
iggulden
last
lighted
fire
gradually
thin
and
cease
against
her
will
she
fell
to
wondering
how
many
moones
elphicks
and
torrells
had
been
swung
round
the
turn
of
the
broad
mall
stairs
then
she
remembered
the
old
man
talk
of
being
like
a
and
buried
her
face
on
scottie
neck
at
last
a
horse
feet
clinked
upon
flags
rustled
in
the
old
grey
straw
of
the
rickyard
and
she
found
herself
facing
the
vicar
a
figure
she
had
seen
at
church
declaiming
impossibilities
sophie
was
a
unitarian
in
an
unnatural
voice
he
dead
she
said
without
preface
old
iggulden
i
was
coming
for
a
talk
with
the
vicar
passed
in
uncovered
ah
she
heard
him
say
how
long
have
you
been
here
since
a
quarter
to
she
looked
at
her
watch
earnestly
and
saw
that
her
hand
did
not
shake
i
sit
with
him
now
till
the
doctor
comes
think
you
could
tell
him
and
yes
betts
in
the
cottage
with
the
wistaria
next
the
blacksmith
i
afraid
this
has
been
rather
a
shock
to
sophie
nodded
and
fled
toward
the
village
her
body
failed
her
for
a
moment
she
dropped
beneath
a
hedge
and
looked
back
at
the
great
house
in
some
fashion
its
silence
and
stolidity
steadied
her
for
her
errand
betts
small
and
dark
was
almost
as
unconcerned
as
friars
pardon
yiss
yiss
of
course
dear
me
well
iggulden
he
had
had
his
day
in
my
father
time
muriel
get
me
my
little
blue
bag
please
yiss
they
come
down
like
in
still
weather
no
warnin
at
all
muriel
my
bicycle
the
fowlhouse
i
tell
dallas
she
trundled
off
on
her
wheel
like
a
brown
bee
while
sophie
heaven
above
and
earth
beneath
changed
walked
stiffly
home
to
fall
over
george
at
his
letters
in
a
muddle
of
laughter
and
tears
it
all
quite
natural
for
them
she
gasped
they
come
down
like
in
still
weather
yiss
no
there
was
anything
in
the
least
horrible
only
only
oh
george
that
poor
shiny
stick
of
his
between
his
poor
thin
knees
i
could
have
borne
it
if
scottie
had
howled
i
did
know
the
vicar
was
so
so
sensitive
he
said
he
was
afraid
it
was
ra
rather
a
shock
betts
told
me
to
go
home
and
i
wanted
to
collapse
on
her
floor
but
i
did
disgrace
myself
i
i
could
have
left
him
could
i
you
sure
you
took
no
cried
cloke
who
had
heard
the
news
by
which
is
older
but
swifter
than
marconi
no
i
perfectly
well
sophie
protested
you
lay
down
till
cloke
patted
her
shoulder
be
very
pleased
though
she
no
proper
understandin
for
twenty
they
came
before
twilight
a
man
in
moleskins
and
a
little
palsied
old
woman
who
chirruped
like
a
wren
i
his
son
said
the
man
to
sophie
among
the
lavender
bushes
we
a
difference
twenty
year
back
and
did
speak
since
but
i
his
son
all
the
and
we
thank
you
for
the
i
only
glad
i
happened
to
be
there
she
answered
and
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
meant
it
we
heard
he
spoke
a
lot
o
you
one
time
an
another
since
you
came
we
thank
you
kindly
the
man
added
are
you
the
son
that
was
in
america
she
asked
yes
on
my
uncle
farm
in
connecticut
he
was
what
they
call
whereabouts
in
connecticut
asked
george
over
her
shoulder
veering
holler
was
the
name
i
was
there
six
year
with
my
how
small
the
world
is
sophie
cried
why
all
my
mother
people
come
from
veering
hollow
there
must
be
some
there
still
the
lashmars
did
you
ever
hear
of
them
i
remember
hearing
that
name
seems
to
me
he
answered
but
his
face
was
blank
as
the
back
of
a
spade
a
little
before
dusk
a
woman
in
grey
striding
like
a
and
bearing
on
her
arm
a
long
pole
crashed
through
the
orchard
calling
for
food
george
upon
whom
the
unannounced
english
worked
mysteriously
fled
to
the
parlour
but
cloke
came
forward
beaming
sophie
could
not
escape
we
only
just
heard
of
it
said
the
stranger
turning
on
her
been
out
with
the
all
day
it
was
a
splendidly
thing
did
you
er
kill
said
sophie
she
knew
from
books
she
could
not
go
far
wrong
here
yes
a
dry
bitch
seventeen
pounds
was
the
answer
a
splendidly
sportin
thing
of
you
to
do
poor
old
iggulden
oh
that
said
sophie
enlightened
if
there
had
been
any
people
at
pardons
it
would
never
have
happened
he
have
been
looked
after
but
what
can
you
expect
from
a
parcel
of
london
solicitors
cloke
murmured
something
no
i
soaked
from
the
knees
down
if
i
hang
about
i
shall
get
chilled
a
cup
of
tea
cloke
and
i
can
eat
one
of
your
sandwiches
as
i
she
wiped
her
face
with
a
green
and
yellow
silk
handkerchief
yes
my
lady
cloke
ran
and
returned
swiftly
our
land
marches
with
pardons
for
a
mile
on
the
south
she
explained
waving
the
full
cup
but
one
has
quite
enough
to
do
with
one
own
people
without
poachin
still
if
i
known
i
have
sent
dora
of
course
have
you
seen
her
this
afternoon
cloke
no
i
wonder
whether
that
girl
did
sprain
her
ankle
thank
it
was
a
formidable
hunk
of
bread
and
bacon
that
cloke
presented
as
i
was
sayin
pardons
is
a
scandal
lettin
people
die
like
dogs
there
ought
to
be
people
there
who
do
their
duty
you
done
yours
though
there
the
faintest
call
upon
you
good
night
tell
dora
if
she
comes
gone
she
strode
away
munching
her
crust
and
sophie
reeled
breathless
into
the
parlour
to
shake
the
shaking
george
why
did
you
keep
catching
my
eye
behind
the
blind
why
did
you
come
out
and
do
your
duty
because
i
should
have
burst
did
you
see
the
mud
on
its
cheek
he
said
once
i
dare
look
again
who
is
she
god
a
local
deity
then
anyway
she
another
of
the
things
expected
to
know
by
cloke
shocked
at
their
levity
told
them
that
it
was
lady
conant
wife
of
sir
walter
conant
baronet
a
large
landholder
in
the
neighbourhood
and
if
not
god
at
least
his
visible
providence
george
made
her
talk
of
that
family
for
an
hour
laughter
said
sophie
afterward
in
their
own
room
is
the
mark
of
the
savage
why
could
you
control
your
emotions
it
all
real
to
it
all
real
to
me
that
my
trouble
he
answered
in
an
altered
tone
anyway
it
real
enough
to
mark
time
with
do
you
think
so
what
mean
she
asked
quickly
though
she
knew
his
voice
that
i
better
i
well
enough
to
what
at
this
he
waved
his
hand
round
the
one
room
i
must
have
something
to
play
with
till
i
fit
for
work
ah
she
sat
on
the
bed
and
leaned
forward
her
hands
clasped
i
wonder
if
it
good
for
we
been
better
here
than
anywhere
he
went
on
slowly
one
could
always
sell
it
she
nodded
gravely
but
her
eyes
sparkled
the
only
thing
that
worries
me
is
what
happened
this
morning
i
want
to
know
how
you
feel
about
it
if
it
on
your
nerves
in
the
least
we
can
have
the
old
farm
at
the
back
of
the
house
pulled
down
or
perhaps
it
has
spoiled
the
notion
for
you
pull
it
down
she
cried
you
no
business
faculty
why
where
we
could
live
while
we
putting
the
big
house
in
order
almost
under
the
same
roof
no
what
happened
this
morning
seemed
to
be
more
of
a
of
a
leading
than
anything
else
there
ought
to
be
people
at
pardons
lady
conant
quite
i
was
thinking
more
of
the
woods
and
the
roads
i
could
double
the
value
of
the
place
in
six
what
do
they
want
for
it
she
shook
her
head
and
her
loosened
hair
fell
glowingly
about
her
cheeks
thousand
dollars
they
take
less
than
half
what
we
paid
for
our
old
yacht
when
we
married
and
we
did
have
a
good
time
in
her
you
were
well
i
discovered
i
was
too
much
of
an
american
to
be
content
to
be
a
rich
man
son
you
are
blaming
me
for
that
oh
no
only
it
was
a
very
businesslike
honeymoon
how
far
are
you
along
with
the
deal
george
i
can
mail
the
deposit
on
the
purchase
money
morning
and
we
can
have
the
thing
completed
in
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
if
you
say
friars
pardon
friars
pardon
sophie
chanted
rapturously
her
dark
gray
eyes
big
with
delight
all
the
farms
gale
anstey
burnt
house
rocketts
the
home
farm
and
griffons
sure
you
got
all
he
smiled
and

the

i
think
i
have
all
this
whitewashed
sophie
broke
in
pointing
to
the
ceiling
the
whole
place
is
a
scandal
lady
conant
is
quite
right
george
when
did
you
begin
to
fall
in
love
with
the
house
in
the
greenroom
that
first
day
i
i
not
in
love
with
it
one
must
do
something
to
mark
time
till
fit
for
or
when
we
stood
under
the
oaks
and
the
door
opened
oh
ought
i
to
go
to
poor
iggulden
funeral
she
sighed
with
utter
happiness
would
they
call
it
a
liberty
now
said
he
but
i
liked
but
you
did
own
him
at
the
date
of
his
that
would
keep
me
away
only
they
made
such
a
fuss
about
the
watching
she
caught
her
breath
it
might
be
ostentatious
from
that
point
of
view
too
oh
george
she
reached
for
his
hand
we
two
little
orphans
moving
in
worlds
not
realized
and
we
shall
make
some
bad
breaks
but
we
going
to
have
the
time
of
our
we
run
up
to
london
and
see
if
we
can
hurry
those
english
law
solicitors
i
want
to
get
to
they
went
they
suffered
many
things
ere
they
returned
across
the
fields
in
a
fly
one
saturday
night
nursing
a
two
by
box
of
deeds
and
maps
lawful
owners
of
friars
pardon
and
the
five
decayed
farms
therewith
i
do
most
sincerely
and
trust
you
be
madam
cloke
gasped
when
she
was
told
the
news
by
the
kitchen
fire
goodness
it
is
a
marriage
sophie
exclaimed
a
little
awed
for
to
them
the
joke
which
to
an
american
means
work
was
only
just
beginning
if
it
took
in
a
proper
spirit
cloke
eye
turned
toward
her
oven
send
and
have
that
mended
sophie
whispered
we
could
noticing
said
cloke
slowly
from
the
times
you
walked
there
that
you
an
your
lady
was
drawn
to
it
but
but
i
know
as
we
ever
precisely
thought
his
wife
glance
checked
him
that
we
were
that
sort
of
people
said
george
we
are
sure
of
it
ourselves
perhaps
said
cloke
rubbing
his
knees
just
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
perhaps
you
park
it
what
that
said
george
turn
it
all
into
a
fine
park
like
violet
hill
he
jerked
a
thumb
to
westward
that
sangres
bought
it
was
four
farms
and
sangres
made
a
fine
park
of
them
with
a
herd
of
faller
then
it
would
be
friars
pardon
said
sophie
would
it
i
do
know
as
i
ever
heard
pardons
was
ever
anything
but
wheat
wool
only
some
gentlemen
say
that
parks
are
less
trouble
than
he
laughed
nervously
but
the
gentry
o
course
they
keep
on
pretty
much
as
they
was
used
i
see
said
sophie
how
did
sangres
make
his
money
i
never
rightly
heard
it
was
pepper
an
spices
or
it
may
ha
been
gloves
no
gloves
was
sir
reginald
liss
at
marley
end
spices
was
sangres
he
a
brazilian
gentleman
very
sunburnt
be
sure
o
one
thing
you
wo
any
trouble
said
cloke
just
before
they
went
to
bed
now
the
news
of
the
purchase
was
told
to
and
cloke
alone
at
of
a
saturday
none
left
the
farm
till
they
set
out
for
church
next
morning
yet
when
they
reached
the
church
and
were
about
to
slip
aside
into
their
usual
seats
a
little
beyond
the
font
where
they
could
see
the
tails
of
the
bellropes
waggle
and
twist
at
ringing
time
they
were
swept
forward
irresistibly
a
cloke
on
either
flank
and
yet
they
had
not
walked
with
the
clokes
upon
the
bosom
of
a
verger
who
ushered
them
into
a
room
of
a
pew
at
the
head
of
the
left
aisle
under
the
pulpit
this
he
sighed
reproachfully
is
the
pardons
pew
and
shut
them
in
they
could
see
little
more
than
the
choir
boys
in
the
chancel
but
to
the
roots
of
the
hair
of
their
necks
they
felt
the
congregation
behind
mercilessly
devouring
them
by
look
when
the
wicked
man
turneth
the
strong
alien
voice
of
the
priest
vibrated
under
the
roof
and
a
loneliness
unfelt
before
swamped
their
hearts
as
they
searched
for
places
in
the
unfamiliar
church
of
england
service
the
lord
prayer
our
father
which
art
set
the
seal
on
that
desolation
sophie
found
herself
thinking
how
in
other
lands
their
purchase
would
long
ere
this
have
been
discussed
from
every
point
of
view
in
a
dozen
prints
forgetting
that
george
for
months
had
not
been
allowed
to
glance
at
those
black
and
bellowing
here
was
nothing
but
silence
not
even
hostility
the
game
was
up
to
them
the
other
players
hid
their
cards
and
waited
suspense
she
felt
was
in
the
air
and
when
her
sight
cleared
saw
indeed
a
mural
tablet
of
a
footless
bird
brooding
upon
the
carven
motto
wayte
awhyle
wayte
at
the
litany
george
had
trouble
with
an
unstable
hassock
and
drew
the
slip
of
carpet
under
the
pewseat
sophie
pushed
her
end
back
also
and
shut
her
eyes
against
a
burning
that
felt
like
tears
when
she
opened
them
she
was
looking
at
her
mother
maiden
name
fairly
carved
on
a
blue
flagstone
on
the
pew
floor
ellen
lashmar
ob
aetat
she
nudged
george
and
pointed
sheltered
as
they
kneeled
they
looked
for
more
knowledge
but
the
rest
of
the
slab
was
blank
ever
hear
of
her
he
whispered
never
knew
any
of
us
came
from
coincidence
perhaps
but
it
makes
me
feel
better
and
she
smiled
and
winked
away
a
tear
on
her
lashes
and
took
his
hand
while
they
prayed
for
all
women
labouring
of
child
not
in
the
perils
of
childbirth
and
the
sparrows
who
had
found
their
way
through
the
guards
behind
the
glass
windows
chirped
above
the
faded
gilt
and
alabaster
family
tree
of
the
conants
the
baronet
pew
was
on
the
right
of
the
aisle
after
service
its
inhabitants
moved
forth
without
haste
but
so
as
to
block
effectively
a
dusky
person
with
a
large
family
who
champed
in
their
rear
spices
i
think
said
sophie
deeply
delighted
as
the
sangres
closed
up
after
the
conants
let
get
away
but
when
they
came
out
many
folk
whose
eyes
were
one
still
lingered
by
the
lychgate
i
want
to
see
if
any
more
lashmars
are
buried
here
said
sophie
not
now
this
seems
to
be
show
day
come
home
quickly
he
replied
a
group
of
families
the
clokes
a
little
apart
opened
to
let
them
through
the
men
saluted
with
jerky
nods
the
women
with
remnants
of
a
curtsey
only
iggulden
son
his
mother
on
his
arm
lifted
his
hat
as
sophie
passed
your
people
said
the
clear
voice
of
lady
conant
in
her
ear
i
suppose
so
said
sophie
blushing
for
they
were
within
two
yards
of
her
but
it
was
not
a
question
then
that
child
looks
as
if
it
were
coming
down
with
mumps
you
ought
to
tell
the
mother
she
should
have
brought
it
to
i
ca
leave
behind
my
lady
the
woman
said
she
set
the
afire
in
a
minute
she
that
forward
with
the
matches
ai
you
maudie
dear
has
dallas
seen
her
not
yet
my
he
must
you
ca
get
away
of
course
my
idiotic
maid
is
coming
in
for
her
teeth
at
twelve
she
shall
pick
her
up
at
gale
anstey
is
it
at
yes
thank
you
very
much
my
i
ought
to
have
done
it
said
lady
conant
apologetically
but
there
has
been
no
one
at
pardons
for
so
long
that
you
forgive
my
poaching
now
ca
you
lunch
with
us
the
vicar
usually
comes
too
i
do
use
the
horses
on
a
sunday
she
glanced
at
the
chariot
it
only
a
mile
across
the
you
you
very
kind
said
sophie
hating
herself
because
her
lip
trembled
my
dear
the
compelling
tone
dropped
to
a
soothing
gurgle
suppose
i
do
know
how
it
feels
to
come
to
a
strange
county
country
i
should
say
away
from
one
own
people
when
i
first
left
the
shires
i
shropshire
you
know
i
cried
for
a
day
and
a
night
but
fretting
does
make
loneliness
any
better
oh
here
dora
she
did
sprain
her
leg
that
i
as
lame
as
a
tree
still
said
the
tall
maiden
frankly
you
ought
to
go
out
with
the
chapin
i
believe
they
drawing
your
water
next
sir
walter
had
already
led
off
george
and
the
vicar
came
up
on
the
other
side
of
sophie
there
was
no
escaping
the
swift
procession
or
the
leisurely
lunch
where
talk
came
and
went
in
eddies
that
had
the
village
for
their
centre
sophie
heard
the
vicar
and
sir
walter
address
her
husband
lightly
as
chapin
she
also
remembered
many
women
known
in
a
previous
life
who
habitually
addressed
their
husbands
as
mr
after
lunch
lady
conant
talked
to
her
explicitly
of
maternity
as
that
is
achieved
in
cottages
and
remote
from
aid
and
of
the
duty
thereto
of
the
mistress
of
pardons
a
gate
in
a
beech
hedge
reached
across
triple
lawns
let
them
out
before
into
the
unkempt
south
side
of
their
land
i
want
your
hand
please
said
sophie
as
soon
as
they
were
safe
among
the
beech
boles
and
the
lawless
hollies
remember
the
old
maid
in
and
the
guitar
who
heard
the
commissary
swear
and
hardly
reckoned
herself
a
maiden
lady
afterward
because
i
a
relative
of
hers
lady
conant
is
did
you
find
out
anything
about
the
lashmars
he
interrupted
i
did
ask
i
going
to
write
to
aunt
sydney
about
it
first
oh
lady
conant
said
something
at
lunch
about
their
having
bought
some
land
from
some
lashmars
a
few
years
ago
i
found
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
last
what
did
you
say
i
said
how
interesting
like
that
i
not
going
to
push
myself
forward
i
been
hearing
about
sangres
efforts
in
that
direction
and
you
i
could
see
you
behind
the
flowers
was
it
very
deep
water
dear
george
mopped
a
brow
already
browned
by
outdoor
exposures
oh
no
dead
easy
he
answered
i
bought
friars
pardon
to
prevent
sir
walter
birds
a
cock
pheasant
scuttered
through
the
dry
leaves
and
exploded
almost
under
their
feet
sophie
jumped
that
one
of
said
george
calmly
well
your
nerves
are
better
at
any
rate
said
she
did
you
tell
you
bought
the
thing
to
play
with
no
that
was
where
my
nerve
broke
down
i
only
made
one
bad
break
i
think
i
said
i
could
see
why
hiring
land
to
men
to
farm
was
as
much
a
business
proposition
as
anything
and
what
did
they
say
they
smiled
i
shall
know
what
that
smile
means
some
day
they
waste
their
smiles
see
that
track
by
gale
anstey
they
looked
down
from
the
edge
of
the
hanger
over
a
hollow
people
by
twos
and
threes
in
their
sunday
best
filed
slowly
along
the
paths
that
connected
farm
to
farm
i
never
seen
so
many
on
our
land
before
said
sophie
why
is
it
to
show
us
we
must
shut
up
their
rights
of
those
we
been
using
cross
lots
said
sophie
forcibly
yes
any
one
of
would
cost
us
two
thousand
pounds
each
in
legal
expenses
to
but
we
do
want
to
she
said
the
whole
community
would
fight
if
we
but
it
our
land
we
can
do
what
we
it
not
our
land
we
only
paid
for
it
we
belong
to
it
and
it
belongs
to
the
people
our
people
they
call
i
been
to
lunch
with
the
english
they
passed
slowly
from
one
field
to
the
next
flushed
with
pride
of
ownership
plotting
alterations
and
restorations
at
each
turn
halting
in
their
tracks
to
argue
spreading
apart
to
embrace
two
views
at
once
or
closing
in
to
consider
one
couples
moved
out
of
their
way
but
smiling
covertly
we
shall
make
some
bad
breaks
he
said
at
last
together
though
you
wo
let
anyone
else
in
will
you
except
the
contractors
this
syndicate
handles
this
proposition
by
its
little
but
you
might
feel
the
want
of
some
one
she
insisted
i
shall
but
it
will
be
you
it
business
sophie
but
it
going
to
be
good
please
god
she
answered
flushing
and
cried
to
herself
as
they
went
back
to
tea
it
worth
it
oh
it
worth
the
repairing
and
moving
into
friars
pardon
was
business
of
the
most
varied
and
searching
but
all
done
english
fashion
without
friction
time
and
money
alone
were
asked
the
rest
lay
in
the
hands
of
beneficent
advisers
from
london
or
spirits
male
and
female
called
up
by
and
cloke
from
the
wastes
of
the
farms
in
the
centre
stood
george
and
sophie
a
little
aghast
their
interests
reaching
out
on
every
side
i
ai
sayin
anything
against
londoners
said
cloke
clerk
of
the
outer
works
consulting
engineer
head
of
the
immigration
bureau
and
superintendent
of
woods
and
forests
but
your
own
people
wo
go
about
to
make
more
than
a
fair
profit
out
of
how
is
one
to
know
said
george
five
years
from
now
or
so
on
maybe
you
be
lookin
over
your
first
year
accounts
and
knowin
what
you
know
then
you
say
billy
beartup
or
old
cloke
as
it
might
be
me
proper
when
i
was
new
no
man
likes
to
have
that
sort
of
thing
laid
up
against
i
think
i
see
said
george
but
five
years
is
a
long
time
to
look
i
doubt
if
that
oak
billy
beartup
throwed
in
reuben
ghyll
will
be
fit
for
her
floor
in
less
than
seven
cloke
drawled
yes
that
my
work
said
sophie
billy
beartup
of
griffons
a
woodman
by
training
and
birth
a
tenant
farmer
by
misfortune
of
marriage
had
laid
his
broad
axe
at
her
feet
a
month
before
sorry
if
i
committed
you
to
another
and
we
sha
even
know
where

wrong
with
your
new
carriage
drive
before
that
time
either
said
cloke
ever
anxious
to
keep
the
balance
true
with
an
ounce
or
two
in
sophie
favour
the
past
four
months
had
taught
george
better
than
to
reply
the
carriage
road
winding
up
the
hill
was
his
present
keen
interest
they
set
off
to
look
at
it
and
the
imported
american
scraper
which
had
blighted
the
none
too
sunny
soul
of
skim
winsh
the
carter
but
young
iggulden
was
in
charge
now
and
under
his

incautious
skim
cause
you
take
no
hurt
when
you
fall
out
of
your
cart
drunk
on
a
saturday

the
answer
i

after
the
loud

you

the
answer
come
from
your
uncle

doubtful
whether
so
remote
a
land
as
america

at
him
scornfully

your

wants
taking
pinky
large
ears
had
caught
the
sound
of
voices
and
as
the
two
broke
through
the
laurels
the
men
were
hard
at
work
their
eyes
on
sophie
feet
she
had
been
less
fortunate
in
her
inquiries
than
iggulden
for
her
aunt
sydney
of
meriden
a
badged
and
certificated
daughter
of
the
revolution
to
boot
answered
her
inquiries
with
a
discourse
on
patriotism
the
leaflets
of
a
village
improvement
society
of
which
she
was
president
and
a
demand
for
an
overdue
subscription
to
a
factory
girls
reading
circle
sophie
burned
it
all
in
the
orpheus
and
eurydice
grate
and
kept
her
own
counsel
what
i
want
to
know
said
george
when
spring
was
coming
and
the
gardens
needed
thought
is
who
will
ever
pay
me
for
my
labour
i
put
in
at
least
half
a
million
dollars
worth
sure
you
not
taking
too
much
out
of
yourself
his
wife
asked
oh
no
i
have
been
conscious
of
myself
all
he
looked
at
his
brown
english
gaiters
and
smiled
it
all
behind
me
now
i
believe
i
could
sit
down
and
think
of
all
that
those
months
before
we
do
ah
do
she
cried
but
i
must
go
back
one
day
you
do
want
to
keep
me
out
of
business
always
or
do
you
he
ended
with
a
nervous
laugh
sophie
sighed
as
she
drew
her
own
of
old
iggulden
cutting
from
the
hall
rack
are
you
overdoing
it
too
you
look
a
little
tired
he
said
you
make
me
tired
i
going
to
rocketts
to
see
cloke
about
this
was
the
sister
of
the
telegraphist
promoted
to
be
at
pardons
coming
i
due
at
burnt
house
to
see
about
the
new
well
by
the
way
there
a
sore
throat
at
gale
anstey
that
my
province
do
interfere
the
whybarne
children
always
have
sore
throats
they
do
it
for
keep
away
from
gale
anstey
till
i
make
sure
honey
cloke
ought
to
have
told
these
people
do
tell
have
you
learnt
that
yet
but
i
obey
me
lord
see
you
later
she
set
off
afoot
for
within
the
three
main
roads
that
bounded
the
blunt
triangle
of
the
estate
even
by
night
one
could
scarcely
hear
the
carts
on
them
wheels
were
not
used
except
for
farm
work
the
footpaths
served
all
other
purposes
and
though
at
first
they
had
planned
improvements
they
had
soon
fallen
in
with
the
customs
of
their
hidden
kingdom
and
moved
about
the
ways
by
woodland
hedgerow
and
shaw
as
freely
as
the
rabbits
indeed
for
the
most
part
sophie
walked
bareheaded
beneath
her
helmet
of
chestnut
hair
but
she
had
been
plagued
of
late
by
vague
toothaches
which
she
explained
to
cloke
who
asked
some
questions
how
it
came
about
sophie
never
knew
but
after
a
while
behold
cloke
arm
was
about
her
waist
and
her
head
was
on
that
deep
bosom
behind
the
shut
kitchen
door
my
dear
my
dear
the
elder
woman
almost
sobbed
an
mean
to
tell
me
you
never
suspicioned
why
why
where
was
you
ever
taught
anything
at
all
of
course
it
is
it
what
we
been
only
waitin
for
all
of
us
time
and
again
i
said
to
lady
she
checked
herself
now
we
shall
be
as
we
should
but
but
but
sophie
whimpered
an
to
see
you
buildin
your
nest
so
busy
pianos
and
books
an
never
thinkin
of
a
nursery
no
more
i
sophie
sat
bolt
upright
and
began
to
laugh
time
enough
the
fingers
tapped
thoughtfully
on
the
broad
knee
but
they
must
be
folk
over
yonder
with
you
have
you
thought
to
send
for
your
mother
she
dead
my
dear
my
dear
never
mind
she
be
happy
where
she
knows
is
god
work
an
we
was
only
waitin
for
it
for
you
never
failed
in
your
duty
yet
it
your
way
what
did
you
say
about
my
mary
doings
cloke
face
hardened
as
she
pressed
her
chin
on
sophie
forehead
if
any
of
your
girls
thinks
to
arbitrary
now
i
but
they
wo
my
dear
i
see
they
do
their
duty
too
be
sure
you
no
when
sophie
walked
back
across
the
fields
heaven
and
earth
changed
about
her
as
on
the
day
of
old
iggulden
death
for
an
instant
she
thought
of
the
wide
turn
of
the
staircase
and
the
new
paint
that
no
coffin
corner
could
scar
but
presently
the
shadow
passed
in
a
pure
wonder
and
bewilderment
that
made
her
reel
she
leaned
against
one
of
their
new
gates
and
looked
over
their
lands
for
some
other
stay
well
she
said
resignedly
half
aloud
we
must
try
to
make
him
feel
that
he
is
a
third
in
our
party
and
turned
the
corner
that
looked
over
friars
pardon
giddy
sick
and
faint
of
a
sudden
the
house
they
had
bought
for
a
whim
stood
up
as
she
had
never
seen
it
before
ample
prepared
by
course
of
generations
for
all
such
things
as
it
had
steadied
her
when
it
lay
desolate
so
now
that
it
had
meaning
from
their
few
months
of
life
within
it
soothed
and
promised
good
she
went
alone
and
quickly
into
the
hall
and
kissed
either
whispering
be
good
to
me
you
know
you
never
failed
in
your
duty
when
the
matter
was
explained
to
george
he
would
have
sailed
at
once
to
their
own
land
but
this
sophie
forbade
i
do
want
science
she
said
i
just
want
to
be
loved
and
there
is
time
for
that
at
home
besides
she
added
looking
out
of
the
window
it
would
be
george
was
forced
to
soothe
himself
with
linking
friars
pardon
to
the
telegraph
system
of
great
britain
by
telephone
of
a
mile
of
poles
put
in
by
whybarne
and
a
few
friends
one
of
these
was
a
foreigner
from
the
next
parish
said
he
when
the
line
was
being
run
there
an
old
ellum
right
in
our
road
shall
us
throw
her
toot
hill
parish
folk
neither
grace
nor
good
luck
god
help
old
whybarne
shouted
the
local
proverb
from
three
poles
down
the
line
we
ai
goin
to
lay
any
to
here
not
till
we
know
where
we
are
yet
awhile
swing
round
swing
round
to
this
day
then
that
sudden
kink
in
the
straight
line
across
the
upper
pasture
remains
a
mystery
to
sophie
and
george
nor
can
they
tell
why
skim
winsh
who
came
to
his
cottage
under
dutton
shaw
most
musically
drunk
at
of
every
saturday
night
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
sang
no
more
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
steps
where
sophie
always
feared
he
would
break
his
neck
the
path
was
undoubtedly
an
ancient
right
of
way
and
at
on
saturdays
skim
remembered
it
was
his
duty
to
posterity
to
keep
it
open
till
cloke
spoke
to
him
once
she
spoke
likewise
to
her
daughter
mary
sewing
maid
at
pardons
and
to
mary
best
new
friend
the
imported
london
who
taught
mary
to
trim
hats
and
found
the
country
dullish
but
there
was
no
noise
at
no
time
was
there
any
noise
and
when
sophie
walked
abroad
she
met
no
one
in
her
path
unless
she
had
signified
a
wish
that
way
then
they
appeared
to
protest
that
all
was
well
with
them
and
their
children
their
chickens
their
roofs
their
and
their
sons
in
the
police
or
the
railway
service
but
do
you
find
it
dull
dear
said
george
loyally
doing
his
best
not
to
worry
as
the
months
went
by
i
been
so
busy
putting
my
house
in
order
i
have
had
time
to
think
said
she
do
you
no
no
if
i
could
only
be
sure
of
she
turned
on
the
green
couch
it
was
empire
not
heppelwhite
after
all
and
laid
aside
a
list
of
linen
and
blankets
it
has
changed
everything
has
it
she
whispered
oh
lord
yes
but
i
still
think
if
we
went
back
to
baltimore
and
missed
our
first
real
summer
together
no
thank
you
me
but
we
absolutely
is
that
what
i
doing
my
best
to
remedy
do
you
worry
i
like
it
like
it
to
the
marrow
of
my
little
bones
you
do
realize
what
her
house
means
to
a
woman
we
thought
we
were
living
in
it
last
year
but
we
had
begun
to
do
you
rejoice
in
your
study
george
i
prefer
being
here
with
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
by
the
couch
and
took
her
hand
seven
she
said
as
the
french
clock
struck
year
before
last
just
be
coming
back
from
he
winced
at
the
recollection
then
laughed
business
i
been
at
work
ten
solid
hours
where
did
you
lunch
with
the
conants
no
at
dutton
shaw
sitting
on
a
log
with
my
feet
in
a
swamp
but
we
found
out
where
the
old
spring
is
and
we
going
to
pipe
it
down
to
gale
anstey
next
i
come
and
see
oh
please
open
the
door
dear
i
want
to
look
down
the
passage
is
that
corner
by
the
lovely
where
the
sun
strikes
in
she
looked
through
eyes
at
the
vista
of
and
pale
green
all
steeped
in
liquid
gold
there
a
step
out
of
jane
elphick
bedroom
she
went
on
and
his
first
step
in
the
world
ought
to
be
up
i
should
wonder
if
those
people
had
put
it
there
on
purpose
george
will
it
make
any
odds
to
you
if
he
a
girl
he
answered
as
he
had
many
times
before
that
his
interest
was
his
wife
not
the
child
then
you
the
only
person
who
thinks
she
laughed
do
be
silly
dear
it
expected
i
know
it
my
duty
i
sha
be
able
to
look
our
people
in
the
face
if
i
what
concern
is
it
of
theirs
confound
you
see
luckily
the
tradition
of
the
house
is
boys
cloke
says
so
i
provided
for
shall
you
ever
begin
to
understand
these
people
i
and
we
bought
it
for
fun
for
fun
he
groaned
and
here
we
are
held
up
for
goodness
knows
how
long
why
were
you
thinking
of
selling
it
he
did
not
answer
do
you
remember
the
second
chapin
she
demanded
this
was
a
bold
brazen
little
woman
a
widow
for
choice
who
on
sophie
death
was
guilefully
to
marry
george
for
his
wealth
and
ruin
him
in
a
year
george
being
busy
sophie
had
invented
her
some
two
years
after
her
marriage
and
conceived
she
was
alone
among
wives
in
so
doing
you
are
going
to
bring
her
up
again
he
asked
anxiously
i
only
want
to
say
that
i
should
hate
any
one
who
bought
pardons
ten
times
worse
than
i
used
to
hate
the
second
chapin
think
what
put
into
it
of
our
two
at
least
a
couple
of
million
dollars
i
know
i
could
have
made
he
broke
off
the
beasts
she
went
on
they
be
sure
to
build
a
lodge
at
the
gates
and
cut
the
lawn
up
for
bedding
out
you
must
leave
instructions
in
your
will
that
he
never
to
do
that
george
you
he
laughed
and
took
her
hand
again
but
said
nothing
till
it
was
time
to
dress
then
he
muttered
what
the
devil
use
is
a
man
country
to
him
when
he
ca
do
business
in
it
friars
pardon
stood
faithful
to
its
tradition
at
the
appointed
time
was
born
not
that
third
in
their
party
to
whom
sophie
meant
to
be
so
kind
but
a
godling
in
beauty
it
was
manifest
excelling
eros
as
in
wisdom
confucius
an
enhancer
of
delights
a
renewer
of
companionships
and
an
interpreter
of
destiny
this
last
george
did
not
realise
till
he
met
lady
conant
striding
through
dutton
shaw
a
few
days
after
the
event
my
dear
fellow
she
cried
and
slapped
him
heartily
on
the
back
i
ca
tell
you
how
glad
we
all
are
oh
she
be
all
right
never
been
any
trouble
over
the
birth
of
an
heir
at
pardons
now
where
the
dooce
is
it
she
felt
largely
in
her
and
drew
out
a
small
silver
mug
i
sent
a
note
to
your
wife
about
it
but
my
silly
ass
of
a
groom
forgot
to
take
this
you
can
save
me
a
tramp
give
her
my
she
marched
off
amid
her
guard
of
grave
airedales
the
mug
was
worn
and
dented
above
the
twined
initials
was
the
crest
of
a
footless
bird
and
the
motto
wayte
awhyle
wayte
that
the
other
end
of
the
riddle
sophie
whispered
when
he
saw
her
that
evening
read
her
note
the
english
write
beautiful
the
warmest
of
welcomes
to
your
little
man
i
hope
he
will
appreciate
his
native
land
now
he
has
come
to
it
though
you
have
said
nothing
we
can
not
of
course
look
on
him
as
a
little
stranger
and
so
i
am
sending
him
the
old
lashmar
christening
mug
it
has
been
with
us
since
gregory
lashmar
your
brother
george
stared
at
his
wife
go
on
she
twinkled
from
the
pillows
mother
brother
sold
his
place
to
walter
family
we
seem
to
have
acquired
some
of
your
household
gods
at
that
time
but
nothing
survives
except
the
mug
and
the
old
cradle
which
i
found
in
the
and
am
having
put
in
order
for
you
i
hope
little
george
lashmar
he
will
be
too
wo
he
will
live
to
see
his
grandchildren
cut
their
teeth
on
his
mug
affectionately
yours
alice
conant
how
quiet
you
kept
about
it
all
well
i
do
swear
said
sophie
bad
for
the
infant
but
how
in
the
world
did
she
get
at
it
have
you
ever
said
a
word
about
the
lashmars
you
know
the
only
time
to
young
iggulden
at
rocketts
when
iggulden
your
brother
she
traced
the
whole
connection
more
than
your
aunt
sydney
could
do
what
does
she
mean
about
our
keeping
quiet
sophie
eyes
sparkled
i
thought
that
out
too
we
got
back
at
the
english
at
last
ca
you
see
that
she
thought
that
we
thought
my
mother
being
a
lashmar
was
one
of
those
things
we
expect
the
english
to
find
out
for
themselves
and
that
impressed
her
she
turned
the
mug
in
her
white
hands
and
sighed
happily
awhyle
wayte
awhyle
that
not
a
bad
motto
george
it
been
worth
but
still
i
do
quite
see
i
should
wonder
if
they
do
think
our
coming
here
was
part
of
a
scheme
to
be
near
our
ancestors
they
understand
that
and
look
how
they
accepted
us
all
of
are
we
so
undesirable
in
ourselves
george
grunted
be
just
me
lord
that
wretched
sangres
man
has
twice
our
money
can
you
see
marm
conant
slapping
him
between
the
shoulders
not
by
a
jugful
the
poor
beast
does
exist
do
you
think
it
that
then
he
looked
toward
the
cot
by
the
fire
where
the
godling
snorted
the
minute
i
get
well
i
shall
find
out
from
cloke
what
every
lashmar
gives
in
doles
that
nicer
than
tips
every
time
a
lashmite
is
born
i
done
my
duty
thus
far
but
there
much
expected
of
entered
here
cloke
and
hung
worshipping
over
the
cot
they
showed
her
the
mug
and
her
face
shone
oh
now
lady
conant
sent
it
be
all
proper
wo
it
of
course
he
have
to
be
but
seein
what
he
is
we
was
hopin
all
your
people
was
hopin
it
be
too
and
just
round
it
out
a
very
mug
quite
unique
i
should
imagine
awhyle
wayte
awhyle
that
true
with
the
lashmars
i
heard
very
slow
to
fill
their
houses
they
are
most
like
master
george
wo
open
nursery
till
he
poor
lamb
cried
sophie
but
how
did
you
know
my
folk
were
lashmars
cloke
thought
deeply
i
sure
i
ca
quite
say
but
a
belief
likely
that
it
was
something
you
may
have
let
drop
to
young
iggulden
when
you
was
at
rocketts
that
may
have
been
what
give
us
an
inkling
an
so
it
came
out
one
thing
in
the
way
o
talk
leading
to
another
and
those
american
people
at
veering
holler

very
with
news

great
scott

george
under
his
breath

the
simple
peasant

cloke

only
wonderin
this
afternoon

so
afraid
we
to
ask
you
sir
now
master
george
wake
a
litty
minute
lammie
a
few
months
later
the
three
of
them
were
down
at
the
brook
in
the
gale
anstey
woods
to
consider
the
rebuilding
of
a
footbridge
carried
away
by
spring
floods
george
lashmar
chapin
wanted
all
the
bluebells
on
earth
that
day
to
eat
and
sophie
adored
him
in
a
voice
like
to
the
cooing
of
a
dove
so
business
was
delayed
here
the
place
said
his
father
at
last
among
the
water
but
where
the
deuce
are
the
cloke
i
told
you
to
have
them

if
f
you
say
so
cloke
answered
with
a
thrust
of
the
underlip
they
both
knew
but
i
did
say
so
what
on
earth
have
you
brought
that
here
for
we
are
building
a
railway
bridge
why
in
america
bits
would
be
i
do
know
nothin
about
that
said
cloke
an
i
nothin
to

ai
to

ever
come
creepin
up
on
you
or
tryin
to
lead
you
further
in
than
you
set
out
a
year
ago
george
would
have
danced
with
impatience
now
he
scraped
a
little
mud
off
his
old
gaiters
with
his
spud
and
waited
all
i
say
is
that
you
can
put
up
larch
and
make
a
job
of
it
and
by
the
time
the
young
master

now
i
brought
down
a
couple
of
as
sweet
oak
timbers

an
it
off
your
mind
or
good
all
way
i
do
say

to
do
again
you

call
to
regard
my
words
but
you

out
of
no
said
george
after
a
pause
i
been
realising
that
for
some
time
make
it
oak
then
we
ca
get
out
of
the
recall
i
am
the
land
of
their
fathers
in
me
the
virtue
stays
i
will
bring
back
my
children
after
certain
days
under
their
feet
in
the
grasses
my
clinging
magic
runs
they
shall
return
as
strangers
they
shall
remain
as
sons
over
their
heads
in
the
branches
of
their
ancient
trees
i
weave
an
incantation
and
draw
them
to
my
knees
scent
of
smoke
in
the
evening
smell
of
rain
in
the
night
the
hours
the
days
and
the
seasons
order
their
souls
aright
till
i
make
plain
the
meaning
of
all
my
thousand
years
till
i
fill
their
hearts
with
knowledge
while
i
fill
their
eyes
with
tears
garm
a
hostage
one
night
a
very
long
time
ago
i
drove
to
an
indian
military
cantonment
called
mian
mir
to
see
amateur
theatricals
at
the
back
of
the
infantry
barracks
a
soldier
his
cap
over
one
eye
rushed
in
front
of
the
horses
and
shouted
that
he
was
a
dangerous
highway
robber
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
a
friend
of
mine
so
i
told
him
to
go
home
before
any
one
caught
him
but
he
fell
under
the
pole
and
i
heard
voices
of
a
military
guard
in
search
of
some
one
the
driver
and
i
coaxed
him
into
the
carriage
drove
home
swiftly
undressed
him
and
put
him
to
bed
where
he
waked
next
morning
with
a
sore
headache
very
much
ashamed
when
his
uniform
was
cleaned
and
dried
and
he
had
been
shaved
and
washed
and
made
neat
i
drove
him
back
to
barracks
with
his
arm
in
a
fine
white
sling
and
reported
that
i
had
accidentally
run
over
him
i
did
not
tell
this
story
to
my
friend
sergeant
who
was
a
hostile
and
unbelieving
person
but
to
his
lieutenant
who
did
not
know
us
quite
so
well
three
days
later
my
friend
came
to
call
and
at
his
heels
slobbered
and
fawned
one
of
the
finest
of
the
breed
two
parts
bull
and
one
terrier
that
i
had
ever
set
eyes
on
he
was
pure
white
with
a
saddle
just
behind
his
neck
and
a
fawn
diamond
at
the
root
of
his
thin
whippy
tail
i
had
admired
him
distantly
for
more
than
a
year
and
vixen
my
own
knew
him
too
but
did
not
approve
for
you
said
my
friend
but
he
did
not
look
as
though
he
liked
parting
with
him
nonsense
that
dog
worth
more
than
most
men
stanley
i
said
that
and
more
the
dog
rose
on
his
hind
legs
and
stood
upright
for
a
full
minute
eyes
right
he
sat
on
his
haunches
and
turned
his
head
sharp
to
the
right
at
a
sign
he
rose
and
barked
thrice
then
he
shook
hands
with
his
right
paw
and
bounded
lightly
to
my
shoulder
here
he
made
himself
into
a
necktie
limp
and
lifeless
hanging
down
on
either
side
of
my
neck
i
was
told
to
pick
him
up
and
throw
him
in
the
air
he
fell
with
a
howl
and
held
up
one
leg
part
o
the
trick
said
his
owner
you
going
to
die
now
dig
yourself
your
little
grave
an
shut
your
little
still
limping
the
dog
hobbled
to
the
dug
a
hole
and
lay
down
in
it
when
told
that
he
was
cured
he
jumped
out
wagging
his
tail
and
whining
for
applause
he
was
put
through
other
tricks
such
as
showing
how
he
would
hold
a
man
safe
i
was
that
man
and
he
sat
down
before
me
his
teeth
bared
ready
to
spring
and
how
he
would
stop
eating
at
the
word
of
command
i
had
no
more
than
finished
praising
him
when
my
friend
made
a
gesture
that
stopped
the
dog
as
though
he
had
been
shot
took
a
piece
of
from
his
helmet
handed
it
to
me
and
ran
away
while
the
dog
looked
after
him
and
howled
i
read
sir
i
give
you
the
dog
because
of
what
you
got
me
out
of
he
is
the
best
i
know
for
i
made
him
myself
and
he
is
as
good
as
a
man
please
do
not
give
him
too
much
to
eat
and
please
do
not
give
him
back
to
me
for
i
not
going
to
take
him
if
you
will
keep
him
so
please
do
not
try
to
give
him
back
any
more
i
have
kept
his
name
back
so
you
can
call
him
anything
and
he
will
answer
but
please
do
not
give
him
back
he
can
kill
a
man
as
easy
as
anything
but
please
do
not
give
him
too
much
meat
he
knows
more
than
a
man
vixen
sympathetically
joined
her
shrill
little
yap
to
the
despairing
cry
and
i
was
annoyed
for
i
knew
that
a
man
who
cares
for
dogs
is
one
thing
but
a
man
who
loves
one
dog
is
quite
another
dogs
are
at
the
best
no
more
than
verminous
vagrants
foul
feeders
and
unclean
by
the
law
of
moses
and
mohammed
but
a
dog
with
whom
one
lives
alone
for
at
least
six
months
in
the
year
a
free
thing
tied
to
you
so
strictly
by
love
that
without
you
he
will
not
stir
or
exercise
a
patient
temperate
humorous
wise
soul
who
knows
your
moods
before
you
know
them
yourself
is
not
a
dog
under
any
ruling
i
had
vixen
who
was
all
my
dog
to
me
and
i
felt
what
my
friend
must
have
felt
at
tearing
out
his
heart
in
this
style
and
leaving
it
in
my
garden
however
the
dog
understood
clearly
enough
that
i
was
his
master
and
did
not
follow
the
soldier
as
soon
as
he
drew
breath
i
made
much
of
him
and
vixen
yelling
with
jealousy
flew
at
him
had
she
been
of
his
own
sex
he
might
have
cheered
himself
with
a
fight
but
he
only
looked
worriedly
when
she
nipped
his
deep
iron
sides
laid
his
heavy
head
on
my
knee
and
howled
anew
i
meant
to
dine
at
the
club
that
night
but
as
darkness
drew
in
and
the
dog
snuffed
through
the
empty
house
like
a
child
trying
to
recover
from
a
fit
of
sobbing
i
felt
that
i
could
not
leave
him
to
suffer
his
first
evening
alone
so
we
fed
at
home
vixen
on
one
side
and
the
on
the
other
she
watching
his
every
mouthful
and
saying
explicitly
what
she
thought
of
his
table
manners
which
were
much
better
than
hers
it
was
vixen
custom
till
the
weather
grew
hot
to
sleep
in
my
bed
her
head
on
the
pillow
like
a
christian
and
when
morning
came
i
would
always
find
that
the
little
thing
had
braced
her
feet
against
the
wall
and
pushed
me
to
the
very
edge
of
the
cot
this
night
she
hurried
to
bed
purposefully
every
hair
up
one
eye
on
the
stranger
who
had
dropped
on
a
mat
in
a
helpless
hopeless
sort
of
way
all
four
feet
spread
out
sighing
heavily
she
settled
her
head
on
the
pillow
several
times
to
show
her
little
airs
and
graces
and
struck
up
her
usual
whiney
before
slumber
the
softly
edged
toward
me
i
put
out
my
hand
and
he
licked
it
instantly
my
wrist
was
between
teeth
and
her
warning
aaarh
said
as
plainly
as
speech
that
if
i
took
any
further
notice
of
the
stranger
she
would
bite
i
caught
her
behind
her
fat
neck
with
my
left
hand
shook
her
severely
and
said
vixen
if
you
do
that
again
you
be
put
into
the
verandah
now
remember
she
understood
perfectly
but
the
minute
i
released
her
she
mouthed
my
right
wrist
once
more
and
waited
with
her
ears
back
and
all
her
body
flattened
ready
to
bite
the
big
dog
tail
thumped
the
floor
in
a
humble
and
way
i
grabbed
vixen
a
second
time
lifted
her
out
of
bed
like
a
rabbit
she
hated
that
and
yelled
and
as
i
had
promised
set
her
out
in
the
verandah
with
the
bats
and
the
moonlight
at
this
she
howled
then
she
used
coarse
language
not
to
me
but
to
the
bullterrier
till
she
coughed
with
exhaustion
then
she
ran
round
the
house
trying
every
door
then
she
went
off
to
the
stables
and
barked
as
though
some
one
were
stealing
the
horses
which
was
an
old
trick
of
hers
last
she
returned
and
her
snuffing
yelp
said
i
be
good
let
me
in
and
i
be
good
she
was
admitted
and
flew
to
her
pillow
when
she
was
quieted
i
whispered
to
the
other
dog
you
can
lie
on
the
foot
of
the
the
bull
jumped
up
at
once
and
though
i
felt
vixen
quiver
with
rage
she
knew
better
than
to
protest
so
we
slept
till
the
morning
and
they
had
early
breakfast
with
me
bite
for
bite
till
the
horse
came
round
and
we
went
for
a
ride
i
do
think
the
bull
had
ever
followed
a
horse
before
he
was
wild
with
excitement
and
vixen
as
usual
squealed
and
scuttered
and
scooted
and
took
charge
of
the
procession
there
was
one
corner
of
a
village
near
by
which
we
generally
passed
with
caution
because
all
the
yellow
of
the
place
gathered
about
it
they
were
starving
beasts
and
though
utter
cowards
yet
where
nine
or
ten
of
them
get
together
they
will
mob
and
kill
and
eat
an
english
dog
i
kept
a
whip
with
a
long
lash
for
them
that
morning
they
attacked
vixen
who
perhaps
of
design
had
moved
from
beyond
my
horse
shadow
the
bull
was
ploughing
along
in
the
dust
fifty
yards
behind
rolling
in
his
run
and
smiling
as
will
i
heard
vixen
squeal
half
a
dozen
of
the
curs
closed
in
on
her
a
white
streak
came
up
behind
me
a
cloud
of
dust
rose
near
vixen
and
when
it
cleared
i
saw
one
tall
pariah
with
his
back
broken
and
the
bull
wrenching
another
to
earth
vixen
retreated
to
the
protection
of
my
whip
and
the
bull
paddled
back
smiling
more
than
ever
covered
with
the
blood
of
his
enemies
that
decided
me
to
call
him
garin
of
the
bloody
breast
who
was
a
great
person
in
his
time
or
garm
for
short
so
leaning
forward
i
told
him
what
his
temporary
name
would
be
he
looked
up
while
i
repeated
it
and
then
raced
away
i
shouted
garin
he
stopped
raced
back
and
came
up
to
ask
my
will
then
i
saw
that
my
soldier
friend
was
right
and
that
that
dog
knew
and
was
worth
more
than
a
man
at
the
end
of
the
ride
i
gave
an
order
which
vixen
knew
and
hated
go
away
and
get
washed
i
said
garin
understood
some
part
of
it
and
vixen
interpreted
the
rest
and
the
two
trotted
off
together
soberly
when
i
went
to
the
back
verandah
vixen
had
been
washed
and
was
very
proud
of
herself
but
the
would
not
touch
garm
on
any
account
unless
i
stood
by
so
i
waited
while
he
was
being
scrubbed
and
garm
with
the
soap
creaming
on
the
top
of
his
broad
head
looked
at
me
to
make
sure
that
this
was
what
i
expected
him
to
endure
he
knew
perfectly
that
the
was
only
obeying
orders
another
time
i
said
to
the
you
will
wash
the
great
dog
with
vixen
when
i
send
them
does
he
know
said
the
who
understood
the
ways
of
dogs
garm
i
said
another
time
you
will
be
washed
with
i
knew
that
garm
understood
indeed
next
when
vixen
as
usual
fled
under
my
bed
garm
stared
at
the
doubtful
in
the
verandah
stalked
to
the
place
where
he
had
been
washed
last
time
and
stood
rigid
in
the
tub
but
the
long
days
in
my
office
tried
him
sorely
we
three
would
drive
off
in
the
morning
at
eight
and
come
home
at
six
or
later
vixen
knowing
the
routine
of
it
went
to
sleep
under
my
table
but
the
confinement
ate
into
garm
soul
he
generally
sat
on
the
verandah
looking
out
on
the
mall
and
well
i
knew
what
he
expected
sometimes
a
company
of
soldiers
would
move
along
on
their
way
to
the
fort
and
garm
rolled
forth
to
inspect
them
or
an
officer
in
uniform
entered
into
the
office
and
it
was
pitiful
to
see
poor
garm
welcome
to
the
cloth
not
the
man
he
would
leap
at
him
and
sniff
and
bark
joyously
then
run
to
the
door
and
back
again
one
afternoon
i
heard
him
bay
with
a
full
throat
a
thing
i
had
never
heard
before
and
he
disappeared
when
i
drove
into
my
garden
at
the
end
of
the
day
a
soldier
in
white
uniform
scrambled
over
the
wall
at
the
far
end
and
the
garm
that
met
me
was
a
joyous
dog
this
happened
twice
or
thrice
a
week
for
a
month
i
pretended
not
to
notice
but
garm
knew
and
vixen
knew
he
would
glide
homewards
from
the
office
about
four
as
though
he
were
only
going
to
look
at
the
scenery
and
this
he
did
so
quietly
that
but
for
vixen
i
should
not
have
noticed
him
the
jealous
little
dog
under
the
table
would
give
a
sniff
and
a
snort
just
loud
enough
to
call
my
attention
to
the
flight
garm
might
go
out
forty
times
in
the
day
and
vixen
would
never
stir
but
when
he
slunk
off
to
see
his
true
master
in
my
garden
she
told
me
in
her
own
tongue
that
was
the
one
sign
she
made
to
prove
that
garm
did
not
altogether
belong
to
the
family
they
were
the
best
of
friends
at
all
times
but
vixen
explained
that
i
was
never
to
forget
garm
did
not
love
me
as
she
loved
me
i
never
expected
it
the
dog
was
not
my
dog
could
never
be
my
dog
and
i
knew
he
was
as
miserable
as
his
master
who
tramped
eight
miles
a
day
to
see
him
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
sooner
the
two
were
reunited
the
better
for
all
one
afternoon
i
sent
vixen
home
alone
in
the
garm
had
gone
before
and
rode
over
to
cantonments
to
find
another
friend
of
mine
who
was
an
irish
soldier
and
a
great
friend
of
the
master
i
explained
the
whole
case
and
wound
up
with
and
now
stanley
in
my
garden
crying
over
his
dog
why
does
he
take
him
back
they
both
unhappy
there
no
sense
in
the
little
man
any
more
but
is
his
what
is
his
fit
he
travels
fifty
miles
a
week
to
see
the
brute
and
he
pretends
not
to
notice
me
when
he
sees
me
on
the
road
and
i
as
unhappy
as
he
is
make
him
take
the
dog
it
his
penance
he
set
himself
i
told
him
by
way
of
a
joke
afther
you
run
over
him
so
convenient
that
night
whin
he
was
drunk
i
said
if
he
was
a
catholic
he
do
penance
off
he
went
wid
that
fit
in
his
little
head
an
a
dose
of
fever
an
nothin
would
suit
but
givin
you
the
dog
as
a
hostage
for
what
i
do
want
hostages
from
for
his
good
behaviour
he
keepin
straight
now
the
way
it
no
pleasure
to
associate
wid
has
he
taken
the
pledge
if
was
only
that
i
need
not
care
ye
can
take
the
pledge
for
three
months
on
an
off
he
sez
he
never
see
the
dog
again
an
so
mark
you
he
keep
straight
for
evermore
ye
know
his
fits
well
this
is
wan
of
them
how
the
dog
takin
it
like
a
man
he
the
best
dog
in
india
ca
you
make
stanley
take
him
back
i
can
do
no
more
than
i
have
done
but
ye
know
his
fits
he
just
doin
his
penance
what
will
he
do
when
he
goes
to
the
hills
the
doctor
put
him
on
the
it
is
the
custom
in
india
to
send
a
certain
number
of
invalids
from
each
regiment
up
to
stations
in
the
himalayas
for
the
hot
weather
and
though
the
men
ought
to
enjoy
the
cool
and
the
comfort
they
miss
the
society
of
the
barracks
down
below
and
do
their
best
to
come
back
or
to
avoid
going
i
felt
that
this
move
would
bring
matters
to
a
head
so
i
left
terrence
hopefully
though
he
called
after
me
he
wo
take
the
dog
sorr
you
can
lay
your
month
pay
on
that
ye
know
his
i
never
pretended
to
understand
private
ortheris
and
so
i
did
the
next
best
thing
i
left
him
alone
that
summer
the
invalids
of
the
regiment
to
which
my
friend
belonged
were
ordered
off
to
the
hills
early
because
the
doctors
thought
marching
in
the
cool
of
the
day
would
do
them
good
their
route
lay
south
to
a
place
called
umballa
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
or
more
then
they
would
turn
east
and
march
up
into
the
hills
to
kasauli
or
dugshai
or
subathoo
i
dined
with
the
officers
the
night
before
they
left
they
were
marching
at
five
in
the
morning
it
was
midnight
when
i
drove
into
my
garden
and
surprised
a
white
figure
flying
over
the
wall
that
man
said
my
butler
has
been
here
since
nine
making
talk
to
that
dog
he
is
quite
i
did
not
tell
him
to
go
away
because
he
has
been
here
many
times
before
and
because
the
told
me
that
if
i
told
him
to
go
away
that
great
dog
would
immediately
slay
me
he
did
not
wish
to
speak
to
the
protector
of
the
poor
and
he
did
not
ask
for
anything
to
eat
or
kadir
buksh
said
i
that
was
well
done
for
the
dog
would
surely
have
killed
thee
but
i
do
not
think
the
white
soldier
will
come
any
garm
slept
ill
that
night
and
whimpered
in
his
dreams
once
he
sprang
up
with
a
clear
ringing
bark
and
i
heard
him
wag
his
tail
till
it
waked
him
and
the
bark
died
out
in
a
howl
he
had
dreamed
he
was
with
his
master
again
and
i
nearly
cried
it
was
all
stanley
silly
fault
the
first
halt
which
the
detachment
of
invalids
made
was
some
miles
from
their
barracks
on
the
amritsar
road
and
ten
miles
distant
from
my
house
by
a
mere
chance
one
of
the
officers
drove
back
for
another
good
dinner
at
the
club
cooking
on
the
line
of
march
is
always
bad
and
there
i
met
him
he
was
a
particular
friend
of
mine
and
i
knew
that
he
knew
how
to
love
a
dog
properly
his
pet
was
a
big
fat
retriever
who
was
going
up
to
the
hills
for
his
health
and
though
it
was
still
april
the
round
brown
brute
puffed
and
panted
in
the
club
verandah
as
though
he
would
burst
it
amazing
said
the
officer
what
excuses
these
invalids
of
mine
make
to
get
back
to
barracks
there
a
man
in
my
company
now
asked
me
for
leave
to
go
back
to
cantonments
to
pay
a
debt
he
forgotten
i
was
so
taken
by
the
idea
i
let
him
go
and
he
jingled
off
in
an
ekka
as
pleased
as
punch
ten
miles
to
pay
a
debt
wonder
what
it
was
really
if
you
drive
me
home
i
think
i
can
show
you
i
said
so
he
went
over
to
my
house
in
his
with
the
retriever
and
on
the
way
i
told
him
the
story
of
garm
i
was
wondering
where
that
brute
had
gone
to
he
the
best
dog
in
the
regiment
said
my
friend
i
offered
the
little
fellow
twenty
rupees
for
him
a
month
ago
but
he
a
hostage
you
say
for
stanley
good
conduct
stanley
one
of
the
best
men
i
have
when
he
that
the
reason
why
i
said
a
man
would
have
taken
things
to
heart
as
he
has
we
drove
in
quietly
at
the
far
end
of
the
garden
and
crept
round
the
house
there
was
a
place
close
to
the
wall
all
grown
about
with
tamarisk
trees
where
i
knew
garm
kept
his
bones
even
vixen
was
not
allowed
to
sit
near
it
in
the
full
indian
moonlight
i
could
see
a
white
uniform
bending
over
the
dog
old
man
we
could
not
help
hearing
stanley
voice
for
sake
do
get
bit
and
go
mad
by
any
measly
but
you
can
look
after
yourself
old
man
you
do
get
drunk
an
run
about
your
friends
you
takes
your
bones
an
you
eats
your
biscuit
an
you
kills
your
enemy
like
a
gentleman
i
goin
away
do
i
off
to
kasauli
where
i
wo
see
you
no
i
could
hear
him
holding
garm
nose
as
the
dog
threw
it
up
to
the
stars
you
stay
here
an
an
an
i
go
away
an
try
to
an
i
do
know
to
leave
you
i
do
know
i
think
this
is
damn
silly
said
the
officer
patting
his
foolish
fubsy
old
retriever
he
called
to
the
private
who
leaped
to
his
feet
marched
forward
and
saluted
you
here
said
the
officer
turning
away
his
head
yes
sir
but
i
just
goin
i
shall
be
leaving
here
at
eleven
in
my
cart
you
come
with
me
i
have
sick
men
running
about
fall
over
the
place
report
yourself
at
eleven
we
did
not
say
much
when
we
went
indoors
but
the
officer
muttered
and
pulled
his
retriever
ears
he
was
a
disgraceful
overfed
doormat
of
a
dog
and
when
he
waddled
off
to
my
cookhouse
to
be
fed
i
had
a
brilliant
idea
at
eleven
that
officer
dog
was
nowhere
to
be
found
and
you
never
heard
such
a
fuss
as
his
owner
made
he
called
and
shouted
and
grew
angry
and
hunted
through
my
garden
for
half
an
hour
then
i
said
he
sure
to
turn
up
in
the
morning
send
a
man
in
by
rail
and
find
the
beast
and
return
beast
said
the
officer
i
value
that
dog
considerably
more
than
i
value
any
man
i
know
it
all
very
fine
for
you
to
talk
your
so
she
was
under
my
feet
and
had
she
been
missing
food
and
wages
would
have
stopped
in
my
house
till
her
return
but
some
people
grow
fond
of
dogs
not
worth
a
cut
of
the
whip
my
friend
had
to
drive
away
at
last
with
stanley
in
the
back
seat
and
then
the
said
to
me
what
kind
of
animal
is
bullen
sahib
dog
look
at
him
i
went
to
the
boy
hut
and
the
fat
old
reprobate
was
lying
on
a
mat
carefully
chained
up
he
must
have
heard
his
master
calling
for
twenty
minutes
but
had
not
even
attempted
to
join
him
he
has
no
face
said
the
scornfully
he
is
a
a
spaniel
he
never
tried
to
get
that
cloth
off
his
jaws
when
his
master
called
now
would
have
jumped
through
the
window
and
that
great
dog
would
have
slain
me
with
his
muzzled
mouth
it
is
true
that
there
are
many
kinds
of
next
evening
who
should
turn
up
but
stanley
the
officer
had
sent
him
back
fourteen
miles
by
rail
with
a
note
begging
me
to
return
the
retriever
if
i
had
found
him
and
if
i
had
not
to
offer
huge
rewards
the
last
train
to
camp
left
at
ten
and
stanley
stayed
till
ten
talking
to
garm
i
argued
and
entreated
and
even
threatened
to
shoot
the
but
the
little
man
was
as
firm
as
a
rock
though
i
gave
him
a
good
dinner
and
talked
to
him
most
severely
garm
knew
as
well
as
i
that
this
was
the
last
time
he
could
hope
to
see
his
man
and
followed
stanley
like
a
shadow
the
retriever
said
nothing
but
licked
his
lips
after
his
meal
and
waddled
off
without
so
much
as
saying
thank
you
to
the
disgusted
so
that
last
meeting
was
over
and
i
felt
as
wretched
as
garm
who
moaned
in
his
sleep
all
night
when
we
went
to
the
office
he
found
a
place
under
the
table
close
to
vixen
and
dropped
flat
till
it
was
time
to
go
home
there
was
no
more
running
out
into
the
verandahs
no
slinking
away
for
stolen
talks
with
stanley
as
the
weather
grew
warmer
the
dogs
were
forbidden
to
run
beside
the
cart
but
sat
at
my
side
on
the
seat
vixen
with
her
head
under
the
crook
of
my
left
elbow
and
garm
hugging
the
left
handrail
here
vixen
was
ever
in
great
form
she
had
to
attend
to
all
the
moving
traffic
such
as
that
blocked
the
way
and
camels
and
led
ponies
as
well
as
to
keep
up
her
dignity
when
she
passed
low
friends
running
in
the
dust
she
never
yapped
for
yapping
sake
but
her
shrill
high
bark
was
known
all
along
the
mall
and
other
men
terriers
in
reply
and
looked
over
their
shoulders
and
gave
us
the
road
with
a
grin
but
garm
cared
for
none
of
these
things
his
big
eyes
were
on
the
horizon
and
his
terrible
mouth
was
shut
there
was
another
dog
in
the
office
who
belonged
to
my
chief
we
called
him
bob
the
librarian
because
he
always
imagined
vain
rats
behind
the
bookshelves
and
in
hunting
for
them
would
drag
out
half
the
old
bob
was
a
idiot
but
garm
did
not
encourage
him
he
would
slide
his
head
round
the
door
panting
rats
come
along
garm
and
garm
would
shift
one
forepaw
over
the
other
and
curl
himself
round
leaving
bob
to
whine
at
a
most
uninterested
back
the
office
was
nearly
as
cheerful
as
a
tomb
in
those
days
once
and
only
once
did
i
see
garm
at
all
contented
with
his
surroundings
he
had
gone
for
an
unauthorised
walk
with
vixen
early
one
sunday
morning
and
a
very
young
and
foolish
artilleryman
his
battery
had
just
moved
to
that
part
of
the
world
tried
to
steal
them
both
vixen
of
course
knew
better
than
to
take
food
from
soldiers
and
besides
she
had
just
finished
her
breakfast
so
she
trotted
back
with
a
large
piece
of
the
mutton
that
they
issue
to
our
troops
laid
it
down
on
my
verandah
and
looked
up
to
see
what
i
thought
i
asked
her
where
garin
was
and
she
ran
in
front
of
the
horse
to
show
me
the
way
about
a
mile
up
the
road
we
came
across
our
artilleryman
sitting
very
stiffly
on
the
edge
of
a
culvert
with
a
greasy
handkerchief
on
his
knees
garin
was
in
front
of
him
looking
rather
pleased
when
the
man
moved
leg
or
hand
garin
bared
his
teeth
in
silence
a
broken
string
hung
from
his
collar
and
the
other
half
of
it
lay
all
warm
in
the
artilleryman
still
hand
he
explained
to
me
keeping
his
eyes
straight
in
front
of
him
that
he
had
met
this
dog
he
called
him
awful
names
walking
alone
and
was
going
to
take
him
to
the
fort
to
be
killed
for
a
masterless
pariah
i
said
that
garin
did
not
seem
to
me
much
of
a
pariah
but
that
he
had
better
take
him
to
the
fort
if
he
thought
best
he
said
he
did
not
care
to
do
so
i
told
him
to
go
to
the
fort
alone
he
said
he
did
not
want
to
go
at
that
hour
but
would
follow
my
advice
as
soon
as
i
had
called
off
the
dog
i
instructed
garin
to
take
him
to
the
fort
and
garm
marched
him
solemnly
up
to
the
gate
one
mile
and
a
half
under
a
hot
sun
and
i
told
the
what
had
happened
but
the
young
artilleryman
was
more
angry
than
was
at
all
necessary
when
they
began
to
laugh
several
regiments
he
was
told
had
tried
to
steal
garm
in
their
time
that
month
the
hot
weather
shut
down
in
earnest
and
the
dogs
slept
in
the
bathroom
on
the
cool
wet
bricks
where
the
bath
is
placed
every
morning
as
soon
as
the
man
filled
my
bath
the
two
jumped
in
and
every
morning
the
man
filled
the
bath
a
second
time
i
said
to
him
that
he
might
as
well
fill
a
small
tub
specially
for
the
dogs
nay
said
he
smiling
it
is
not
their
custom
they
would
not
understand
besides
the
big
bath
gives
them
more
the
who
pull
the
punkahs
day
and
night
came
to
know
garin
intimately
he
noticed
that
when
the
swaying
fan
stopped
i
would
call
out
to
the
coolie
and
bid
him
pull
with
a
long
stroke
if
the
man
still
slept
i
would
wake
him
up
he
discovered
too
that
it
was
a
good
thing
to
lie
in
the
wave
of
air
under
the
punkah
maybe
stanley
had
taught
him
all
about
this
in
barracks
at
any
rate
when
the
punkah
stopped
garin
would
first
growl
and
cock
his
eye
at
the
rope
and
if
that
did
not
wake
the
man
it
nearly
always
did
he
would
tiptoe
forth
and
talk
in
the
sleeper
ear
vixen
was
a
clever
little
dog
but
she
could
never
connect
the
punkah
and
the
coolie
so
garin
gave
me
grateful
hours
of
cool
sleep
but
he
was
utterly
wretched
as
miserable
as
a
human
being
and
in
his
misery
he
clung
so
closely
to
me
that
other
men
noticed
it
and
were
envious
if
i
moved
from
one
room
to
another
garin
followed
if
my
pen
stopped
scratching
garm
head
was
thrust
into
my
hand
if
i
turned
half
awake
on
the
pillow
garm
was
up
and
at
my
side
for
he
knew
that
i
was
his
only
link
with
his
master
and
day
and
night
and
night
and
day
his
eyes
asked
one
question
when
is
this
going
to
end
living
with
the
dog
as
i
did
i
never
noticed
that
he
was
more
than
ordinarily
upset
by
the
hot
weather
till
one
day
at
the
club
a
man
said
that
dog
of
yours
will
die
in
a
week
or
two
he
a
then
i
dosed
garin
with
iron
and
quinine
which
he
hated
and
i
felt
very
anxious
he
lost
his
appetite
and
vixen
was
allowed
to
eat
his
dinner
under
his
eyes
even
that
did
not
make
him
swallow
and
we
held
a
consultation
on
him
of
the
best
in
the
place
a
who
cured
the
sick
wives
of
kings
and
the
deputy
of
the
veterinary
service
of
all
india
they
pronounced
upon
his
symptoms
and
i
told
them
his
story
and
garm
lay
on
a
sofa
licking
my
hand
he
dying
of
a
broken
heart
said
the
suddenly
my
word
said
the
deputy
inspector
general
i
believe
macrae
is
perfectly
right
as
the
best
in
the
place
wrote
a
prescription
and
the
veterinary
deputy
went
over
it
afterwards
to
be
sure
that
the
drugs
were
in
the
proper
and
that
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
our
doctor
ever
allowed
his
prescriptions
to
be
edited
it
was
a
strong
tonic
and
it
put
the
dear
boy
on
his
feet
for
a
week
or
two
then
he
lost
flesh
again
i
asked
a
man
i
knew
to
take
him
up
to
the
hills
with
him
when
he
went
and
the
man
came
to
the
door
with
his
kit
packed
on
the
top
of
the
carriage
garin
took
in
the
situation
at
one
red
glance
the
hair
rose
along
his
back
he
sat
down
in
front
of
me
and
delivered
the
most
awful
growl
i
have
ever
heard
in
the
jaws
of
a
dog
i
shouted
to
my
friend
to
get
away
at
once
and
as
soon
as
the
carriage
was
out
of
the
garden
garin
laid
his
head
on
my
knee
and
whined
so
i
knew
his
answer
and
devoted
myself
to
getting
stanley
address
in
the
hills
my
turn
to
go
to
the
cool
came
late
in
august
we
were
allowed
thirty
days
holiday
in
a
year
if
no
one
fell
sick
and
we
took
it
as
we
could
be
spared
my
chief
and
bob
the
librarian
had
their
holiday
first
and
when
they
were
gone
i
made
a
calendar
as
i
always
did
and
hung
it
up
at
the
head
of
my
cot
tearing
off
one
day
at
a
time
till
they
returned
vixen
had
gone
up
to
the
hills
with
me
five
times
before
and
she
appreciated
the
cold
and
the
damp
and
the
beautiful
wood
fires
there
as
much
as
i
did
garm
i
said
we
are
going
back
to
stanley
at
kasauli
kasauli
stanley
stanley
and
i
repeated
it
twenty
times
it
was
not
kasauli
really
but
another
place
still
i
remembered
what
stanley
had
said
in
my
garden
on
the
last
night
and
i
dared
not
change
the
name
then
garm
began
to
tremble
then
he
barked
and
then
he
leaped
up
at
me
frisking
and
wagging
his
tail
not
now
i
said
holding
up
my
hand
when
i
say
we
go
i
pulled
out
the
little
blanket
coat
and
spiked
collar
that
vixen
always
wore
up
in
the
hills
to
protect
her
against
sudden
chills
and
thieving
leopards
and
i
let
the
two
smell
them
and
talk
it
over
what
they
said
of
course
i
do
not
know
but
it
made
a
new
dog
of
garm
his
eyes
were
bright
and
he
barked
joyfully
when
i
spoke
to
him
he
ate
his
food
and
he
killed
his
rats
for
the
next
three
weeks
and
when
he
began
to
whine
i
had
only
to
say
stanley
kasauli
kasauli
stanley
to
wake
him
up
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
it
before
my
chief
came
back
all
brown
with
living
in
the
open
air
and
very
angry
at
finding
it
so
hot
in
the
plains
that
same
afternoon
we
three
and
kadir
buksh
began
to
pack
for
our
month
holiday
vixen
rolling
in
and
out
of
the
twenty
times
a
minute
and
garm
grinning
all
over
and
thumping
on
the
floor
with
his
tail
vixen
knew
the
routine
of
travelling
as
well
as
she
knew
my
she
went
to
the
station
singing
songs
on
the
front
seat
of
the
carriage
while
garin
sat
with
me
she
hurried
into
the
railway
carriage
saw
kadir
buksh
make
up
my
bed
for
the
night
got
her
drink
of
water
and
curled
up
with
her
eye
on
the
tumult
of
the
platform
garin
followed
her
the
crowd
gave
him
a
lane
all
to
himself
and
sat
down
on
the
pillows
with
his
eyes
blazing
and
his
tail
a
haze
behind
him
we
came
to
umballa
in
the
hot
misty
dawn
four
or
five
men
who
had
been
working
hard
fox
eleven
months
shouting
for
our
dales
the
travelling
carriages
that
were
to
take
us
up
to
kalka
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
it
was
all
new
to
garm
he
did
not
understand
carriages
where
you
lay
at
full
length
on
your
bedding
but
vixen
knew
and
hopped
into
her
place
at
once
garin
following
the
kalka
road
before
the
railway
was
built
was
about
miles
long
and
the
horses
were
changed
every
eight
miles
most
of
them
jibbed
and
kicked
and
plunged
but
they
had
to
go
and
they
went
rather
better
than
usual
for
garm
deep
bay
in
their
rear
there
was
a
river
to
be
forded
and
four
bullocks
pulled
the
carriage
and
vixen
stuck
her
head
out
of
the
and
nearly
fell
into
the
water
while
she
gave
directions
garin
was
silent
and
curious
and
rather
needed
reassuring
about
stanley
and
kasauli
so
we
rolled
barking
and
yelping
into
kalka
for
lunch
and
garm
ate
enough
for
two
after
kalka
the
road
wound
among
the
hills
and
we
took
a
curricle
with
ponies
which
were
changed
every
six
miles
no
one
dreamed
of
a
railroad
to
simla
in
those
days
for
it
was
seven
thousand
feet
up
in
the
air
the
road
was
more
than
fifty
miles
long
and
the
regulation
pace
was
just
as
fast
as
the
ponies
could
go
here
again
vixen
led
garm
from
one
carriage
to
the
other
jumped
into
the
back
seat
and
shouted
a
cool
breath
from
the
snows
met
us
about
five
miles
out
of
kalka
and
she
whined
for
her
coat
wisely
fearing
a
chill
on
the
liver
i
had
had
one
made
for
garm
too
and
as
we
climbed
to
the
fresh
breezes
i
put
it
on
and
arm
chewed
it
uncomprehendingly
but
i
think
he
was
grateful
sang
vixen
as
we
shot
round
the
curves
went
the
driver
bugle
at
the
dangerous
places
and
yow
yow
bayed
garm
kadir
buksh
sat
on
the
front
seat
and
smiled
even
he
was
glad
to
get
away
from
the
heat
of
the
plains
that
stewed
in
the
haze
behind
us
now
and
then
we
would
meet
a
man
we
knew
going
down
to
his
work
again
and
he
would
say
what
it
like
below
and
i
would
shout
hotter
than
cinders
what
it
like
up
above
and
he
would
shout
back
just
perfect
and
away
we
would
go
suddenly
kadir
buksh
said
over
his
shoulder
here
is
solon
and
garm
snored
where
he
lay
with
his
head
on
my
knee
solon
is
an
unpleasant
little
cantonment
but
it
has
the
advantage
of
being
cool
and
healthy
it
is
all
bare
and
windy
and
one
generally
stops
at
a
nearby
for
something
to
eat
i
got
out
and
took
both
dogs
with
me
while
kadir
buksh
made
tea
a
soldier
told
us
we
should
find
stanley
out
there
nodding
his
head
towards
a
bare
bleak
hill
when
we
climbed
to
the
top
we
spied
that
very
stanley
who
had
given
me
all
this
trouble
sitting
on
a
rock
with
his
face
in
his
hands
and
his
overcoat
hanging
loose
about
him
i
never
saw
anything
so
lonely
and
dejected
in
my
life
as
this
one
little
man
crumpled
up
and
thinking
on
the
great
gray
hillside
here
garm
left
me
he
departed
without
a
word
and
so
far
as
i
could
see
without
moving
his
legs
he
flew
through
the
air
bodily
and
i
heard
the
whack
of
him
as
he
flung
himself
at
stanley
knocking
the
little
man
clean
over
they
rolled
on
the
ground
together
shouting
and
yelping
and
hugging
i
could
not
see
which
was
dog
and
which
was
man
till
stanley
got
up
and
whimpered
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
suffering
from
fever
at
intervals
and
was
very
weak
he
looked
all
he
said
but
even
while
i
watched
both
man
and
dog
plumped
out
to
their
natural
sizes
precisely
as
dried
apples
swell
in
water
garin
was
on
his
shoulder
and
his
breast
and
feet
all
at
the
same
time
so
that
stanley
spoke
all
through
a
cloud
of
garin
gulping
sobbing
slavering
garm
he
did
not
say
anything
that
i
could
understand
except
that
he
had
fancied
he
was
going
to
die
but
that
now
he
was
quite
well
and
that
he
was
not
going
to
give
up
garin
any
more
to
anybody
under
the
rank
of
beelzebub
then
he
said
he
felt
hungry
and
thirsty
and
happy
we
went
down
to
tea
at
the
where
stanley
stuffed
himself
with
sardines
and
raspberry
jam
and
beer
and
cold
mutton
and
pickles
when
garm
was
climbing
over
him
and
then
vixen
and
i
went
on
garm
saw
how
it
was
at
once
he
said
to
me
three
times
giving
me
both
paws
one
after
another
and
leaping
on
to
my
shoulder
he
further
escorted
us
singing
hosannas
at
the
top
of
his
voice
a
mile
down
the
road
then
he
raced
back
to
his
own
master
vixen
never
opened
her
mouth
but
when
the
cold
twilight
came
and
we
could
see
the
lights
of
simla
across
the
hills
she
snuffled
with
her
nose
at
the
breast
of
my
ulster
i
unbuttoned
it
and
tucked
her
inside
then
she
gave
a
contented
little
sniff
and
fell
fast
asleep
her
head
on
my
breast
till
we
bundled
out
at
simla
two
of
the
four
happiest
people
in
all
the
world
that
night
the
power
of
the
dog
there
is
sorrow
enough
in
the
natural
way
from
men
and
women
to
fill
our
day
but
when
we
are
certain
of
sorrow
in
store
why
do
we
always
arrange
for
more
brothers
and
sisters
i
bid
you
beware
of
giving
your
heart
to
a
dog
to
tear
buy
a
pup
and
your
money
will
buy
love
unflinching
that
can
not
lie
perfect
passion
and
worship
fed
by
a
kick
in
the
ribs
or
a
pat
on
the
head
nevertheless
it
is
hardly
fair
to
risk
your
heart
for
a
dog
to
tear
when
the
fourteen
years
which
nature
permits
are
closing
in
asthma
or
tumour
or
fits
and
the
vet
unspoken
prescription
runs
to
lethal
chambers
or
loaded
guns
then
you
will
find
it
your
own
affair
but
you
given
your
heart
to
a
dog
to
tear
when
the
body
that
lived
at
your
single
will
when
the
whimper
of
welcome
is
stilled
how
still
when
the
spirit
that
answered
your
every
mood
is
gone
wherever
it
goes
for
good
you
will
discover
how
much
you
care
and
will
give
your
heart
to
a
dog
to
tear
we
sorrow
enough
in
the
natural
way
when
it
comes
to
burying
christian
clay
our
loves
are
not
given
but
only
lent
at
compound
interest
of
cent
per
cent
though
it
is
not
always
the
case
i
believe
that
the
longer
we
kept
the
more
do
we
grieve
for
when
debts
are
payable
right
or
wrong
a
loan
is
as
bad
as
a
long
so
why
in
heaven
before
we
are
there
should
we
give
our
hearts
to
a
dog
to
tear
the
mother
hive
if
the
stock
had
not
been
old
and
overcrowded
the
would
never
have
entered
but
where
bees
are
too
thick
on
the
comb
there
must
be
sickness
or
parasites
the
heat
of
the
hive
had
risen
with
the
june
and
though
the
farmers
worked
until
their
wings
ached
to
keep
people
cool
everybody
suffered
a
young
bee
crawled
up
the
greasy
trampled
excuse
me
she
began
but
it
my
first
could
you
kindly
tell
me
if
this
is
my
own
hive
the
guard
snapped
yes
buzz
in
and
be
to
you
next
shame
cried
half
a
dozen
old
workers
with
worn
wings
and
nerves
and
there
was
a
scuffle
and
a
hum
the
little
grey
pressed
close
in
a
crack
in
the
had
waited
this
chance
all
day
she
scuttled
in
like
a
ghost
and
knowing
the
senior
bees
would
turn
her
out
at
once
dodged
into
a
where
youngsters
who
had
not
yet
seen
the
winds
blow
or
the
flowers
nod
discussed
life
here
she
was
safe
for
young
bees
will
tolerate
any
sort
of
stranger
behind
her
came
the
bee
who
had
been
slanged
by
the
guard
what
is
the
world
like
melissa
said
a
companion
cruel
i
brought
in
a
full
load
of
stuff
and
the
guard
told
me
to
go
and
be
she
sat
down
in
the
cool
draught
across
the
combs
if
you
only
heard
said
the
silkily
the
insolence
of
the
guard
tone
when
she
cursed
our
sister
it
aroused
the
entire
she
laid
an
egg
she
had
stolen
in
for
that
purpose
there
was
a
bit
of
a
fuss
on
the
gate
melissa
chuckled
you
were
there
miss
she
did
not
know
how
to
address
the
slim
stranger
do
call
me
i
a
sister
to
all
in
affliction
just
a
my
heart
bled
for
you
beneath
your
the
caressed
melissa
with
her
soft
feelers
and
laid
another
egg
you
must
lay
here
cried
melissa
you
are
a
my
dear
child
i
give
you
my
most
solemn
word
of
honour
those
eggs
those
are
my
principles
and
i
am
ready
to
die
for
she
raised
her
voice
a
little
above
the
rustle
and
tramp
round
her
if
you
like
to
kill
me
pray
do
be
unkind
melissa
said
a
young
bee
impressed
by
the
chaste
folds
of
the
wing
which
hid
her
ceaseless
i
have
done
anything
melissa
answered
she
doing
it
ah
do
let
your
conscience
reproach
you
later
but
when
killed
me
write
me
at
least
as
one
that
loved
her
laying
at
every
sob
the
backed
into
a
crowd
of
young
bees
and
left
melissa
bewildered
and
annoyed
so
she
lifted
up
her
little
voice
in
the
darkness
and
cried
stores
till
a
gang
of
hailed
her
and
she
left
her
load
with
them
i
afraid
i
you
just
now
said
a
voice
over
her
shoulder
i
been
on
the
gate
for
three
hours
and
one
would
the
queen
herself
after
that
no
offence
none
taken
melissa
answered
cheerily
i
shall
be
on
guard
myself
some
day
what
next
to
do
there
a
rumour
of
death
head
moths
about
send
a
gang
of
youngsters
to
the
gate
and
tell
them
to
narrow
it
in
with
a
couple
of
stout
pillars
it
make
the
hive
hot
but
we
ca
have
headers
in
the
middle
of
our
my
only
wings
i
should
think
not
melissa
had
all
a
sound
hereditary
hatred
against
the
big
squeaking
feathery
thief
of
the
hives
tumble
out
she
called
across
the
youngsters
quarters
all
you
who
are
feeding
babies
show
a
leg
pillars
for
the
she
chanted
the
order
at
length
that
nonsense
a
downy
bee
answered
in
the
first
place
i
never
heard
of
a
death
header
coming
into
a
hive
people
do
do
such
things
in
the
second
building
pillars
to
keep
out
is
purely
a
cypriote
trick
unworthy
of
british
bees
in
the
third
if
you
trust
a
death
head
he
will
trust
you
shows
lack
of
confidence
our
dear
sister
in
grey
says
yes
pillars
are
and
provocative
and
a
waste
of
wax
that
is
needed
for
higher
and
more
practical
ends
said
the
from
an
empty
the
safety
of
the
hive
is
the
highest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
you
must
teach
us
to
refuse
work
melissa
began
you
misunderstand
me
as
usual
love
work
the
essence
of
life
but
to
expend
precious
unreturning
vitality
and
real
labour
against
imaginary
danger
that
is
heartbreakingly
absurd
if
i
can
only
teach
a
a
little
toleration
a
little
ordinary
kindness
here
toward
that
absurd
old
bogey
you
call
the
death
header
i
sha
have
lived
in
she
has
lived
in
vain
the
darling
cried
twenty
bees
together
you
should
see
her
saintly
life
melissa
she
just
devotes
herself
to
spreading
her
principles
and
and
she
looks
lovely
an
old
baldish
bee
came
up
the
comb
for
the
gate
get
out
and
chew
scraps
buzz
off
she
said
the
slipped
aside
the
young
bees
trooped
down
the
frame
whispering
what
the
matter
with
said
the
oldster
why
do
they
call
each
other
and
must
be
the
she
sniffed
suspiciously
horrid
stuffy
smell
here
like
stale
quilts
not
i
hope
melissa
not
to
my
knowledge
said
melissa
who
of
course
only
knew
the
as
a
lady
with
principles
and
had
never
thought
to
report
her
presence
she
had
always
imagined
to
be
like
you
had
better
fan
out
this
corner
for
a
little
said
the
old
bee
and
passed
on
melissa
dropped
her
head
at
once
took
firm
hold
with
her
and
fanned
obediently
at
the
regulation
stroke
three
hundred
beats
to
the
second
fanning
tries
a
bee
temper
because
she
must
always
keep
in
the
same
place
where
she
never
seems
to
be
doing
any
good
and
all
the
while
she
is
wearing
out
her
only
wings
when
a
bee
can
not
fly
a
bee
must
not
live
and
a
bee
knows
it
the
crept
forth
and
caressed
melissa
again
i
see
she
murmured
that
at
heart
you
are
one
of
i
work
with
the
hive
melissa
answered
briefly
it
the
same
thing
we
and
the
hive
are
then
why
are
your
feelers
different
from
ours
do
cuddle
do
be
provincial
carissima
you
ca
have
all
the
world
alike
but
why
do
you
lay
eggs
melissa
insisted
you
lay
like
a
queen
only
you
drop
them
in
patches
all
over
the
place
i
watched
ah
brighteyes
so
you
pierced
my
little
subterfuge
yes
they
are
eggs
by
and
by
they
spread
our
principles
are
you
glad
you
gave
me
your
most
solemn
word
of
honour
that
they
were
not
that
was
my
little
subterfuge
dearest
for
the
sake
of
the
cause
now
i
must
reach
the
the
tripped
towards
the
fourth
where
the
young
bees
were
busy
feeding
the
babies
it
takes
some
time
for
a
sound
bee
to
realize
a
malignant
and
continuous
lie
she
very
sweet
and
feathery
was
all
that
melissa
thought
but
her
talk
sounds
like
ivy
honey
tastes
i
better
get
to
my
she
found
the
gate
in
a
sulky
uproar
the
youngsters
told
off
to
the
pillars
had
refused
to
chew
because
it
made
their
jaws
ache
and
were
clamouring
for
virgin
stuff
anything
to
finish
the
job
said
the
badgered
guards
hang
up
some
of
you
and
make
wax
for
these
before
a
bee
can
make
wax
she
must
fill
herself
with
honey
then
she
climbs
to
safe
foothold
and
hangs
while
other
gorged
bees
hang
on
to
her
in
a
cluster
there
they
wait
in
silence
till
the
wax
comes
the
scales
are
either
taken
out
of
the
maker
pockets
by
the
workers
or
tinkle
down
on
the
workers
while
they
wait
the
workers
chew
them
they
are
useless
unchewed
into
the
wax
of
the
hive
but
now
no
sooner
was
the
in
position
than
the
workers
below
broke
out
again
come
down
they
cried
come
down
and
work
come
on
you
levantine
parasites
do
think
to
enjoy
yourselves
up
there
while
we
sweating
down
here
the
cluster
shivered
as
from
hooked
to
hooked
it
telegraphed
uneasiness
at
last
a
worker
sprang
up
grabbed
the
lowest
waxmaker
and
swung
kicking
above
her
companions
i
can
make
wax
too
she
bawled
give
me
a
full
gorge
and
i
make
tons
of
make
it
then
said
the
bee
she
had
grappled
the
spoken
word
snapped
the
current
through
the
cluster
it
shook
and
glistened
like
a
cat
fur
in
the
dark
unhook
it
murmured
no
wax
for
any
one
you
lazy
thieves
hang
up
at
once
and
produce
our
wax
said
the
bees
below
impossible
the
sweat
gone
to
make
your
wax
we
must
have
stillness
warmth
and
food
unhook
unhook
they
broke
up
as
they
murmured
and
disappeared
among
the
other
bees
from
whom
of
course
they
were
undistinguishable
seems
as
if
we
have
to
chew
for
these
pillars
after
all
said
a
worker
not
by
a
whole
comb
cried
the
young
bee
who
had
broken
the
cluster
listen
here
i
studied
the
question
more
than
twenty
minutes
as
simple
as
falling
off
a
daisy
you
heard
of
cheshire
root
and
langstroth
they
had
not
but
they
shouted
good
old
langstroth
just
the
same
those
three
know
all
that
there
is
to
be
known
about
making
hives
one
or
of
must
have
made
ours
and
if
they
made
it
bound
to
look
after
it
ours
is
a
patent
hive
you
can
see
it
on
the
label
good
old
guarantee
hurrah
for
the
label
behind
roared
the
bees
well
such
being
the
case
i
say
that
when
we
find
they
betrayed
us
we
can
exact
from
them
a
terrible
good
old
vengeance
good
old
root
said
chuck
it
the
crowd
cheered
and
broke
away
as
melissa
dived
through
know
where
langstroth
root
and
cheshire
live
if
you
happen
to
want
em
she
asked
of
the
proud
panting
orator
gum
me
if
i
know
they
ever
lived
at
all
but
are
they
beautiful
names
to
buzz
about
did
you
see
how
it
worked
up
the
sisterhood
yes
but
it
did
defend
the
gate
she
replied
ah
perhaps
that
true
but
think
how
delicate
my
position
is
sister
i
a
magnificent
appetite
and
i
do
like
working
it
bad
for
the
mind
my
instinct
tells
me
that
i
can
act
as
a
restraining
influence
on
others
they
would
have
been
worse
but
for
but
melissa
had
already
risen
clear
and
was
heading
for
a
breadth
of
virgin
white
clover
which
to
an
overtired
bee
is
as
soothing
as
plain
knitting
to
a
woman
i
think
i
take
this
load
to
the
nurseries
she
said
when
she
had
finished
it
was
always
quiet
there
in
my
day
and
she
topped
off
with
two
little
pats
of
pollen
for
the
babies
she
was
met
on
the
fourth
by
a
rush
of
excited
sisters
all
buzzing
together
one
at
a
time
let
me
put
down
my
load
now
what
is
it
sacharissa
she
said
grey
sister
that
fluffy
one
i
mean
she
came
and
said
we
ought
to
be
out
in
the
sunshine
gathering
honey
because
life
was
short
she
said
any
old
bee
could
attend
to
our
babies
and
some
day
old
bees
would
that
is
true
melissa
is
it
no
old
bees
can
take
us
away
from
our
babies
can
they
of
course
not
you
feed
the
babies
while
your
heads
are
soft
when
your
heads
harden
you
go
on
to
any
one
knows
we
told
her
so
we
told
her
so
but
she
only
waved
her
feelers
and
said
we
could
all
lay
eggs
like
queens
if
we
chose
and
i
afraid
lots
of
the
weaker
sisters
believe
her
and
are
trying
to
do
it
so
unsettling
sacharissa
sped
to
a
sealed
whose
lid
pulsated
as
the
bee
within
began
to
cut
its
way
out
come
along
precious
she
murmured
and
thinned
the
frail
top
from
the
other
side
a
pale
damp
creased
thing
hoisted
itself
feebly
on
to
the
comb
sacharissa
note
changed
at
once
no
time
to
waste
go
up
the
frame
and
preen
yourself
she
said
report
for
in
my
ward
evening
at
six
stop
a
minute
what
the
matter
with
your
third
right
leg
the
young
bee
held
it
out
in
silence
unmistakably
a
drone
leg
incapable
of
packing
pollen
thank
you
you
need
report
till
the
day
after
sacharissa
turned
to
her
companion
that
the
fifth
oddity
hatched
in
my
ward
since
noon
i
do
like
there
always
a
certain
number
of
said
melissa
you
ca
stop
a
few
working
sisters
from
laying
now
and
then
when
they
overfeed
themselves
they
only
raise
dwarf
but
we
hatching
out
drones
with
workers
stomachs
workers
with
drones
stomachs
and
albinoes
and
who
ca
pack
pollen
like
that
poor
little
beast
yonder
i
do
mind
dwarf
drones
any
more
than
you
do
they
all
die
in
july
but
this
steady
hatch
of
oddities
frightens
me
melissa
how
narrow
of
you
they
are
all
so
delightfully
clever
and
unusual
and
interesting
piped
the
from
a
crack
above
them
come
here
you
dear
downy
duck
and
tell
us
all
about
your
i
wish
she
go
sacharissa
lowered
her
voice
she
meets
these
er
oddities
as
they
dry
out
and
cuddles
in
i
suppose
the
truth
is
that
we
and
too
well
fed
to
swarm
said
melissa
that
is
the
truth
said
the
queen
voice
behind
them
they
had
not
heard
the
heavy
royal
footfall
which
sets
empty
cells
vibrating
sacharissa
offered
her
food
at
once
she
ate
and
dragged
her
weary
body
forward
can
you
suggest
a
remedy
she
said
new
principles
cried
the
from
her
crevice
we
apply
them
quietly
suppose
we
sent
out
a
swarm
melissa
suggested
it
a
little
late
but
it
might
ease
us
it
would
save
us
but
i
know
the
hive
you
shall
see
for
the
old
queen
cried
the
swarming
cry
which
to
a
bee
of
good
blood
should
be
what
the
trumpet
was
to
job
in
spite
of
her
immense
age
three
years
it
rang
between
the
frames
as
a
pibroch
rings
in
a
mountain
pass
the
fanners
changed
their
note
and
repeated
it
up
in
every
gallery
and
the
drones
burly
and
eager
ended
it
on
one
outbreak
of
bugles
la
reine
le
veult
swarm
but
the
roar
which
should
follow
the
call
was
wanting
they
heard
a
broken
grumble
like
the
murmur
of
a
falling
tide
swarm
what
for
catch
me
leaving
a
good
hive
with
fixed
foundations
for
a
rotten
old
oak
out
in
the
open
where
it
may
rain
any
minute
we
all
right
it
a
guaranteed
hive
why
do
they
want
to
turn
us
out
swarming
be
gummed
swarming
was
invented
to
cheat
a
worker
out
of
her
proper
comforts
come
on
off
to
bed
the
noise
died
out
as
the
bees
settled
in
empty
cells
for
the
night
you
hear
said
the
queen
i
know
the
hive
quite
between
ourselves
i
taught
them
that
cried
the
wait
till
my
principles
develop
and
you
see
the
light
from
a
new
you
speak
truth
for
once
the
queen
said
suddenly
for
she
recognized
the
that
light
will
break
into
the
top
of
the
hive
a
hot
smoke
will
follow
it
and
your
children
will
not
be
able
to
hide
in
any
is
it
possible
melissa
whispered
have
sometimes
heard
a
legend
like
it
is
no
legend
the
old
queen
answered
i
had
it
from
my
mother
and
she
had
it
from
hers
after
the
has
grown
strong
a
shadow
will
fall
across
the
gate
a
voice
will
speak
from
behind
a
veil
there
will
be
light
and
hot
smoke
and
earthquakes
and
those
who
live
will
see
everything
that
they
have
done
all
together
in
one
place
burned
up
in
one
great
the
old
queen
was
trying
to
tell
what
she
had
been
told
of
the
bee
master
dealings
with
an
infected
hive
in
the
apiary
two
or
three
seasons
ago
and
of
course
from
her
point
of
view
the
affair
was
as
important
as
the
day
of
judgment
and
then
asked
horrified
sacharissa
then
i
have
heard
that
a
little
light
will
burn
in
a
great
darkness
and
perhaps
the
world
will
begin
again
myself
i
think
tut
tut
the
cried
you
good
fat
people
always
prophesy
ruin
if
things
do
go
exactly
your
way
but
i
grant
you
there
will
be
there
were
when
her
eggs
hatched
the
wax
was
riddled
with
little
tunnels
coated
with
the
dirty
clothes
of
the
caterpillars
flannelly
lines
ran
through
the
the
the
foundations
and
worst
of
all
through
the
babies
in
their
cradles
till
the
sweeper
guards
spent
half
their
time
tossing
out
useless
little
corpses
the
lines
ended
in
a
maze
of
sticky
webbing
on
the
face
of
the
comb
the
caterpillars
could
not
stop
spinning
as
they
walked
and
as
they
walked
everywhere
they
smarmed
and
garmed
everything
even
where
it
did
not
hamper
the
bees
feet
the
stale
sour
smell
of
the
stuff
put
them
off
their
work
though
some
of
the
bees
who
had
taken
to
egg
laying
said
it
encouraged
them
to
be
mothers
and
maintain
a
vital
interest
in
life
when
the
caterpillars
became
moths
they
made
friends
with
the
oddities
albinoes
composites
faceless
drones
halfqueens
and
laying
sisters
and
the
band
of
the
old
stock
worked
themselves
bald
and
to
feed
their
queer
charges
most
of
the
oddities
would
not
and
many
on
account
of
their
malformations
could
not
go
through
a
day
but
the
who
were
always
busy
on
the
found
pleasant
home
occupations
for
them
one
albino
for
instance
divided
the
number
of
pounds
of
honey
in
stock
by
the
number
of
bees
in
the
hive
and
proved
that
if
every
bee
only
gathered
honey
for
seven
and
three
quarter
minutes
a
day
she
would
have
the
rest
of
the
time
to
herself
and
could
accompany
the
drones
on
their
mating
flights
the
drones
were
not
at
all
pleased
another
an
eyeless
drone
with
no
feelers
said
that
all
should
be
perfect
circles
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
grub
or
the
workers
he
proved
that
the
old
cell
was
solely
due
to
the
workers
building
against
each
other
on
opposite
sides
of
the
wall
and
that
if
there
were
no
interference
there
would
be
no
angles
some
bees
tried
the
new
plan
for
a
while
and
found
it
cost
eight
times
more
wax
than
the
old
six
sided
specification
and
as
they
never
allowed
a
cluster
to
hang
up
and
make
wax
in
peace
real
wax
was
scarce
however
they
eked
out
their
task
with
varnish
stolen
from
new
coffins
at
funerals
and
it
made
them
rather
sick
then
they
took
to
cadging
round
and
breweries
because
it
was
easiest
to
get
their
material
from
those
places
and
the
mixture
of
glucose
and
beer
naturally
fermented
in
store
and
blew
the
out
of
shape
besides
smelling
abominably
some
of
the
sound
bees
warned
them
that
gains
never
prosper
but
the
oddities
at
once
surrounded
them
and
balled
them
to
death
that
was
a
punishment
they
were
almost
as
fond
of
as
they
were
of
eating
and
they
expected
the
sound
bees
to
feed
them
curiously
enough
the
instinct
of
loyalty
and
devotion
towards
the
hive
made
the
sound
bees
do
this
though
their
reason
told
them
they
ought
to
slip
away
and
unite
with
some
other
healthy
stock
in
the
apiary
what
about
seven
and
minutes
work
now
said
melissa
one
day
as
she
came
in
i
been
at
it
for
five
hours
and
i
only
half
a
oh
the
hive
subsists
on
the
hival
honey
which
the
hive
produces
said
a
blind
oddity
squatting
in
a
but
honey
is
gathered
from
flowers
outside
two
miles
away
sometimes
cried
melissa
pardon
me
said
the
blind
thing
sucking
hard
but
this
is
the
hive
is
it
not
it
was
worse
luck
it
and
the
hival
honey
is
here
is
it
not
it
opened
a
fresh
to
prove
it
but
it
wo
be
long
at
this
rate
said
melissa
the
rates
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
this
hive
produces
the
hival
honey
you
people
never
seem
to
grasp
the
economic
simplicity
that
underlies
all
oh
me
said
poor
melissa
have
you
ever
been
beyond
the
gate
certainly
not
a
fool
eyes
are
in
the
ends
of
the
earth
mine
are
in
my
it
gorged
till
it
bloated
melissa
took
refuge
in
her
poorly
paid
and
told
sacharissa
the
story
hut
said
that
wise
bee
fretting
with
an
old
maid
of
a
thistle
tell
us
something
new
the
hive
full
of
such
as
him
it
i
what
the
end
to
be
all
the
honey
going
out
and
none
coming
in
things
ca
last
this
way
said
melissa
who
cares
said
sacharissa
i
know
now
how
drones
feel
the
day
before
they
killed
a
short
life
and
a
merry
one
for
if
it
only
were
merry
but
think
of
those
awful
solemn
oddities
waiting
for
us
at
home
crawling
and
clambering
and
preaching
and
dirtying
things
in
the
i
do
mind
that
so
much
as
their
silly
songs
after
we
fed
all
about
among
the
merry
merry
blossoms
said
sacharissa
from
the
deeps
of
a
stale
canterbury
bell
i
do
how
our
queen
said
melissa
cheerfully
hopeless
as
usual
but
she
lays
an
egg
now
and
does
she
so
melissa
backed
out
of
the
next
bell
with
a
jerk
suppose
now
we
sound
workers
tried
to
raise
a
princess
in
some
clean
corner
you
be
put
to
it
to
find
one
the
hive
all
and
muckings
but
well
a
princess
might
help
us
in
the
time
of
the
voice
behind
the
veil
that
the
queen
talks
of
and
anything
is
better
than
working
for
oddities
that
chirrup
about
work
that
they
ca
do
and
waste
what
we
bring
who
cares
said
sacharissa
i
with
you
for
the
fun
of
it
the
oddities
would
ball
us
to
death
if
they
knew
come
home
and
there
is
no
room
to
tell
how
the
experienced
melissa
found
a
frame
so
messed
and
mishandled
by
abandoned
experiments
that
for
very
shame
the
bees
never
went
there
how
in
that
ruin
she
blocked
out
a
royal
cell
of
sound
wax
but
disguised
by
rubbish
till
it
looked
like
a
kopje
among
deserted
kopjes
how
she
prevailed
upon
the
hopeless
queen
to
make
one
last
effort
and
lay
a
worthy
egg
how
the
queen
obeyed
and
died
how
her
spent
carcass
was
flung
out
on
the
rubbish
heap
and
how
a
multitude
of
laying
sisters
went
about
dropping
where
they
listed
and
said
there
was
no
more
need
of
queens
how
covered
by
this
confusion
sacharissa
educated
certain
young
bees
to
educate
certain
bees
in
the
almost
lost
art
of
making
royal
jelly
how
the
nectar
for
it
was
won
out
of
hours
in
the
teeth
of
chill
winds
how
the
hidden
egg
hatched
true
no
drone
but
blood
royal
how
it
was
capped
and
how
desperately
they
worked
to
feed
and
the
now
swarming
oddities
lest
any
break
in
the
should
set
them
to
instituting
inquiries
which
with
songs
about
work
was
their
favourite
amusement
how
in
an
auspicious
hour
on
a
moonless
night
the
princess
came
forth
a
princess
indeed
and
how
melissa
smuggled
her
into
a
dark
empty
to
bide
her
time
and
how
the
drones
knowing
she
was
there
went
about
singing
the
deep
disreputable
of
the
old
days
to
the
scandal
of
the
laying
sisters
who
do
not
think
well
of
drones
these
things
are
written
in
the
book
of
queens
which
is
laid
up
in
the
hollow
of
the
great
ash
ygdrasil
after
a
few
days
the
weather
changed
again
and
became
glorious
even
the
oddities
would
now
join
the
crowd
that
hung
out
on
the
and
would
sing
of
work
among
the
merry
merry
blossoms
till
an
untrained
ear
might
have
received
it
for
the
hum
of
a
working
hive
yet
in
truth
their
had
been
eaten
long
ago
they
lived
from
day
to
day
on
the
efforts
of
the
few
sound
bees
while
the
fretted
and
consumed
again
their
already
ruined
wax
but
the
sound
bees
never
mentioned
these
matters
they
knew
if
they
did
the
oddities
would
hold
a
meeting
and
ball
them
to
death
now
you
see
what
we
have
done
said
the
we
have
created
new
material
a
new
convention
a
new
type
as
we
said
we
and
new
possibilities
for
us
said
the
laying
sisters
gratefully
you
have
given
us
a
new
life
work
vital
and
more
than
that
chanted
the
oddities
in
the
sunshine
you
have
created
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
heaven
cloudless
and
accessible
it
was
a
perfect
august
evening
and
earth
teeming
with
the
merry
merry
blossoms
waiting
only
our
honest
toil
to
turn
them
all
to
good
the
er
aster
and
the
crocus
and
the
er
ladies
smock
in
her
season
the
chrysanthemum
after
her
kind
and
the
guelder
rose
bringing
forth
abundantly
oh
holy
hymettus
said
melissa
awestruck
i
knew
they
did
know
how
honey
was
made
but
they
forgotten
the
order
of
the
flowers
what
will
become
of
them
a
shadow
fell
across
the
as
the
bee
master
and
his
son
came
by
the
oddities
crawled
in
and
a
voice
behind
a
veil
said
neglected
the
old
hive
too
long
give
me
the
melissa
heard
and
darted
through
the
gate
come
oh
come
she
cried
it
is
the
destruction
the
old
queen
foretold
princess
come
really
you
are
too
archaic
for
words
said
an
oddity
in
an
a
cloud
i
admit
may
have
crossed
the
sun
but
why
hysterics
above
all
why
princesses
so
late
in
the
day
are
you
aware
it
the
hival
let
sing
melissa
clawed
past
him
with
all
six
legs
sacharissa
had
run
to
what
was
left
of
the
fertile
down
and
out
she
called
across
the
brown
breadth
of
it
nurses
guards
fanners
sweepers
out
never
mind
the
babies
they
better
out
before
the
light
and
the
hot
smoke
the
princess
first
clear
fearless
call
melissa
had
found
her
rose
and
drummed
through
all
the
frames
la
reine
le
veult
swarm
the
hive
shook
beneath
the
shattering
thunder
of
a
quilt
being
torn
back
do
be
alarmed
dears
said
the
that
our
work
look
up
and
you
see
the
dawn
of
the
new
light
broke
in
the
top
of
the
hive
as
the
queen
had
prophesied
naked
light
on
the
boiling
bewildered
bees
sacharissa
rounded
up
her
rearguard
which
dropped
headlong
off
the
frame
and
joined
the
princess
detachment
thrusting
toward
the
gate
now
panic
was
in
full
blast
and
each
sound
bee
found
herself
embraced
by
at
least
three
oddities
the
first
instinct
of
a
frightened
bee
is
to
break
into
the
stores
and
gorge
herself
with
honey
but
there
were
no
stores
left
so
the
oddities
fought
the
sound
bees
you
must
feed
us
or
we
shall
die
they
cried
holding
and
clutching
and
slipping
while
the
silent
scared
earwigs
and
little
spiders
twisted
between
their
legs
think
of
the
hive
traitors
the
holy
hive
you
should
have
thought
before
cried
the
sound
stay
and
see
the
dawn
of
your
new
they
reached
the
gate
at
last
over
the
soft
bodies
of
many
to
whom
they
had
ministered
on
out
up
roared
melissa
in
the
princess
ear
for
the
sake
to
the
old
oak
the
princess
left
the
circled
once
flung
herself
at
the
lowest
branch
of
the
old
oak
and
her
little
loyal
swarm
you
could
have
covered
it
with
a
pint
mug
followed
hooked
and
hung
hold
close
melissa
gasped
the
old
legends
have
come
true
look
the
hive
was
half
hidden
by
smoke
and
figures
moved
through
the
smoke
they
heard
a
frame
crack
stickily
saw
it
heaved
high
and
twirled
round
between
enormous
hands
a
blotched
bulged
and
perished
horror
of
grey
wax
corrupt
brood
and
small
all
covered
with
crawling
oddities
strange
to
the
sun
why
this
is
a
hive
this
is
a
museum
of
curiosities
said
the
voice
behind
the
veil
it
was
only
the
bee
master
talking
to
his
son
can
you
blame
father
said
a
second
voice
it
rotten
with
see
here
another
frame
came
up
a
finger
poked
through
it
and
it
broke
away
in
rustling
flakes
of
ashy
rottenness
number
four
frame
that
was
your
mother
pet
comb
once
whispered
melissa
to
the
princess
many
the
good

i
watched
her
lay
are
you
confusing
post
hoc
with
propter
hoc
said
the
bee
master
only
succeed
when
weak
bees
let
them
a
third
frame
crackled
and
rose
into
the
light
all
this
is
full
of
laying
brood
that
never
happens
till
the
stock
weakened
phew
he
beat
it
on
his
knee
like
a
tambourine
and
it
also
crumbled
to
pieces
the
little
swarm
shivered
as
they
watched
the
dwarf
squirm
feebly
on
the
grass
many
sound
bees
had
nursed
on
that
frame
well
knowing
their
work
was
useless
but
the
actual
sight
of
even
useless
work
destroyed
disheartens
a
good
worker
no
they
have
some
recuperative
power
left
said
the
second
voice
here
a
queen
cell
but
it
tucked
away
among
what
on
earth
has
come
to
the
little
wretches
they
seem
to
have
lost
the
instinct
of
the
father
held
up
the
frame
where
the
bees
had
experimented
in
circular
it
looked
like
the
pitted
head
of
a
decaying
toadstool
not
altogether
the
son
corrected
there
one
line
at
least
of
perfectly
good
my
work
said
sacharissa
to
herself
i
glad
man
does
me
justice
before
that
frame
too
was
smashed
out
and
thrown
atop
of
the
others
and
the
foul
earwiggy
quilts
as
frame
after
frame
followed
it
the
swarm
beheld
the
upheaval
exposure
and
destruction
of
all
that
had
been
well
or
ill
done
in
every
cranny
of
their
hive
for
generations
past
there
was
black
comb
so
old
that
they
had
forgotten
where
it
hung
orange
buff
and
built
as
bees
were
used
to
build
before
the
days
of
artificial
foundations
and
there
was
a
little
white
frail
new
work
there
were
sheets
on
sheets
of
level
even
that
had
held
in
its
time
unnumbered
thousands
of
unnamed
workers
patches
of
obsolete
broad
and
showing
to
what
marks
the
male
grub
was
expected
to
grow
and
deep
empty
but
still
magnificent
the
whole
gummed
and
glued
into
twisted
awry
on
the
wires
beginnings
abandoned
or
grandiose
composite
cells
pieced
out
with
rubbish
and
capped
with
dirt
good
or
bad
every
inch
of
it
was
so
riddled
by
the
tunnels
of
the
that
it
broke
in
clouds
of
dust
as
it
was
flung
on
the
heap
oh
see
cried
sacharissa
the
great
burning
that
our
queen
foretold
who
can
bear
to
look
a
flame
crawled
up
the
pile
of
rubbish
and
they
smelt
singeing
wax
the
figures
stooped
lifted
the
hive
and
shook
it
upside
down
over
the
pyre
a
cascade
of
oddities
chips
of
broken
comb
scale
fluff
and
grubs
slid
out
crackled
sizzled
popped
a
little
and
then
the
flames
roared
up
and
consumed
all
that
fuel
we
must
disinfect
said
a
voice
get
me
a
the
shell
of
the
hive
was
returned
to
its
place
a
light
was
set
in
its
sticky
emptiness
tier
by
tier
the
figures
built
it
up
closed
the
entrance
and
went
away
the
swarm
watched
the
light
leaking
through
the
cracks
all
the
long
night
at
dawn
one
came
by
fluttering
impudently
there
has
been
a
miscalculation
about
the
new
day
my
dears
she
began
one
ca
expect
people
to
be
perfect
all
at
once
that
was
our
no
the
mistake
was
entirely
ours
said
the
princess
pardon
me
said
the
when
you
think
of
the
enormous
upheaval
call
it
good
or
bad
which
our
influence
brought
about
you
will
admit
that
we
and
we
alone
you
said
the
princess
our
stock
was
not
strong
so
you
came
as
any
other
disease
might
have
come
hang
close
all
my
when
the
sun
rose
veiled
figures
came
down
and
saw
their
swarm
at
the
bough
end
waiting
patiently
within
sight
of
the
old
hive
a
handful

prepared

to

a
bull

stopping

the

left
its

penniless

it

he
discovered
the
secret
of

his

our

captain

further

the

acknowledges
and
recommends
inverting
the
bearings
the
argol
answers
that
she
has
already
done
so
without
effect
and
begins
to
relieve
her
mind
about
cheap
german
enamels
for
the
frenchman
assents
cordially
cries

switches

would
you
like
to
look
round
the
i
have
been
waiting
eagerly
for
this
invitation
and
i
follow
captain
hodgson
from
the
stooping
low
to
avoid
the
bulge
of
the
tanks
we
know
that
fleury
gas
can
lift
anything
as
the
trials
of
showed
but
its
almost
indefinite
powers
of
expansion
necessitate
vast
tank
room
even
in
this
thin
air
the
are
busy
taking
out
of
its
normal
lift
and
still
must
be
checked
by
an
occasional
downdraw
of
the
rudder
or
our
flight
would
become
a
climb
to
the
stars
captain
purnall
prefers
an
overlifted
to
an
underlifted
ship
but
no
two
captains
trim
ship
alike
when
i
take
the
bridge
says
captain
hodgson
you
see
me
shunt
forty
per
cent
of
the
lift
out
of
the
gas
and
run
her
on
the
upper
rudder
with
a
swoop
upward
instead
of
a
swoop
downward
as
you
say
either
way
will
do
it
only
habit
watch
our
tim
fetches
her
down
once
every
thirty
knots
as
regularly
as
so
is
it
shown
on
the

five
or
six
minutes
the
arrow
creeps
from

the
faint

of
the

and
back
slides
the
arrow
to
on
a
falling
slant
of
ten
or
fifteen
knots
in
heavy
weather
you
jockey
her
with
the
screws
as
well
says
captain
hodgson
and
unclipping
the
jointed
bar
which
divides
the
from
the
bare
deck
he
leads
me
on
to
the
floor
here
we
find
paradox
of
the
vacuum
which
we
accept
now
without
thought
literally
in
full
blast
the
three
engines
are
t
fleury
turbines
running
from
to
the
limit
that
is
to
say
up
to
the
point
when
the
blades
make
the

bell
cut
out
a
vacuum
for
themselves
precisely
as
marine
propellers
used
to
do

is
low
on
account
of
the
small
size
of
her
nine

which
though
handier
than
the
old

bell
sooner
the
midships
engine
generally
used
as
a
reinforce

not
running
so
the

and
starboard
turbine
draw
direct
into
the
the
turbines
whistle
reflectively
from
the
on
either
side
the
valves
descend
pillarwise
to
the
and
thence
the
obedient
gas
whirls
through
the
spirals
of
blades
with
a
force
that
would
whip
the
teeth
out
of
a
power
saw
behind
is
its
own
pressure
held
in
leash
of
spurred
on
by
the
before

where
fleury

dances
in
bands
and
whirled
turbillons
of

the
jointed
of

colloid
no

would
endure
the
strain
for
an
instant
and
a
junior
engineer
with
tinted
spectacles
watches
the
ray
intently
it
is
the
very
heart
of
the
machine
a
mystery
to
this
day
even
fleury
who
begat
it
and
unlike

not
explain
how
the

as

once

the

cycle
ray
sees
to
that
and
the

with
the

sees
to
fleury

if
a

of

if
even
the
natural

of
the

the

wink

disappear
and
must
be
laboriously
built
up
again
this
means
half
a

work
for
all

and
an
expense
of
one
hundred

pounds
to
the
for
and
such
trifles
now
look
at
our

wo
find

says
captain

as
the

shunts

our

ground
with

as

so

we

these

came
from

took
them
over
from
the

dominion
of

which
had
them
out
of

of
the

aeroplane
in
the
years
when

still
flew

over

they

which
please

turn

crazy
the
and
the

seated
side
by
side
under
the
dials
are
the
only
machines
in
visible
motion
the
former
sighs
from
time
to

as
the
oil
plunger
rises
and
falls
half
an
inch
the
latter
cased
and
guarded
like
the
aft
exhibits
another
fleury
ray
but
inverted
and
more
green
than
violet
its
function
is
to
shunt
the
lift
out
of
the

and
this
it
will
do
without
watching
that
is
all
a
tiny
wheezing
and
whining
to
itself
beside
a
sputtering
green
lamp
a
hundred

fifty
feet
aft
down

of

restless
and
irresolute
between

laid
on
their

the
empty
perspectives
you
can
hear
the
trickle
of
the
liquefied
gas
flowing
from
the
vacuum
into
the
and
the
soft
of
gaslocks
closing
as
captain
purnall
brings
down
by
the
head
the
hum
of
the
turbines
and
the
boom
of
the
air
on
our
skin
is
no
more
than
a
wrapping
to
the
universal
stillness
and
we

there

on

suddenly
a
bell
thrills
the

run
to
the
and
stand
by
but
the
spectacled
slave
of

in

never
lifts
his

he
must
watch
where

are
and
going
astern
there
is
language
from
the

platform
tim
sparking
badly
about
something
says
the
unruffled
captain
hodgson
let
captain
purnall
is
not
the
suave
man
we
left
half
an
hour
since
but
the
embodied
authority
of
the
ahead
of
us
floats
an
ancient
tramp
of
the
dingiest
with
no
more
right
to
the
lane
than
has
a
to
a
modern
road
she
carries
an
obsolete
barbette
conning
tower
a
affair
with
railed
platform
forward
and
our
warning
beam
plays
on
the
top
of
it
as
a
policeman
lantern
flashes
on
the

sneak
like
a
too

a
navigator
in
his
captain
purnall

there

he
says

watches

in

of

you
poor

this

what

the

george

says
she
in

herself
and
ca
quit

even

we

his

roars
to

my

my

heaves
up
in

and
takes
the

humming
her

open

her
hang
down
like
tentacles
we
shut
off
our
beam
as
she
adjusts
herself
steering
to
a
hair
over
the
tramp
the
mate
comes
up
his
arm
strapped
to
his
side
and
stumbles
into
the
cradle
a
man
with
a
ghastly
scarlet
head
follows
shouting
that
he
must
go
back
and
build
up
his
ray
the
mate
assures
him
that
he
will
find
a
nice
new
ray
all
ready
in
the
liner
the
bandaged
head
goes
up
wagging
excitedly
a
youth
and
a
woman
follow
the
liner
cheers
hollowly
above
us
and
we
see
the
passengers
faces
at
the
saloon
colloid
that
a
pretty
girl
what
the
fool
waiting
for
now
says
captain
purnall
the
skipper
comes
up
still
appealing
to
us
to
stand
by
and
see
him
fetch
john
he
dives
below
and
returns
at
which
we
little
human
beings
in
the

cheer
louder
than
ever
with
the
ship
kitten
up
fly
the
liner
hissing
slings
her
underbody
crashes
home
and
she
hurtles
away
again
the
dial
shows
less
than
feet
the
mark
boat
signals
we
must
attend
to
the
derelict
now
whistling
her
as
she
falls
beneath
us
in
long
sick
zigzags
keep
our
beam
on
her
and
send
out
a
general
warning
says
captain
purnall
following
her
down
there
is
no
need
not
a
liner
in
air
but
knows
the
meaning
of
that
vertical
beam
and
gives
us
and
our
quarry
a
wide
berth
but
she
drown
in
the
water
wo
she
i
ask
not
always
is
his
answer
i
known
a
derelict
and
sift
her
engines
out
of
herself
and
flicker
round
the
lower

for
three
weeks
on

we
run
no
risks
pith
her
george
and
look
sharp
there
weather
captain
hodgson
opens
the
underbody
colloid
swings
the
heavy
out
of
its
rack
which
in
liners
is
generally
cased
as
a
settee
and
at
two
hundred
feet
releases
the
catch
we
hear
the
whir
of
the
arms
opening
as
they
descend
the
derelict
forehead
is
punched
in
starred
across
and
rent
diagonally
she
falls
stern
first
our
beam
upon
her
slides
like
a
lost
soul
down
that
pitiless
ladder
of
light
and
the
atlantic
takes
her
a
filthy
business
says
hodgson
i
wonder
what
it
must
have
been
like
in
the
old
days
the
thought
had
crossed
my
mind
too
what
if
that
wavering
carcass
had
been
filled
with
the
men
of
the
old
days
each
one
of
them
taught
that
is
the
horror
of
it
that
after
death
he
would
very
possibly
go
for
ever
to
unspeakable
torment
and
scarcely
a
generation
ago
we
one
knows
now
that
we
are
only
our
fathers
upon
the
earth
we
i
say
ripped
and
rammed
and
pithed
to
admiration
here
tim
from
the
control
platform
shouts
that
we
are
to
get
into
our
inflators
and
to
bring
him
his
at
once
we
hurry
into
the
heavy
rubber
suits
the
engineers
are
already
dressed
and
inflate
at
the
taps
inflators
are
thrice
as
thick
as
a
racing
man
flickers
and
chafe
abominably
under
the
armpits
george
takes
the
wheel
until
tim
has
blown
himself
up
to
the
extreme
of
rotundity
if
you
kicked
him
off
the
to
the
deck
he
would
bounce
back
but
it
is
that
will
do
the
kicking
the
mark
boat
mad
stark
ravin
crazy
he
snorts
returning
to
command
she
says
there
a
bad
ahead
and
wants
me
to
pull
over
to
greenland
i
see
her
pithed
first
we
wasted
half
an
hour
fussing
over
that
dead
duck
down
under
and
now
i
expected
to
go
rubbin
my
back
all
round
the
pole
what
does
she
think
a
postal
packet
made
of
gummed
silk
tell
her
we
coming
on
straight
george
buckles
him
into
the
frame
and
switches
on
the
direct
control
now
under
tim
left
toe
lies
the
accelerator
under
his
left
heel
the
reverse
and
so
with
the
other
foot
the
stops
stand
out
on
the
rim
of
the
where
the
fingers
of
his
left
hand
can
play
on
them
at
his
right
hand
is
the
midships
engine
lever
ready
to
be
thrown
into
gear
at
a
moment
notice
he
leans
forward
in
his
belt
eyes
glued
to
the
colloid
and
one
ear
cocked
toward
the
general
communicator
henceforth
he
is
the
strength
and
direction
of
through
whatever
may
befall
the
banks
mark
boat
is
reeling
out
pages
of
a
directions
to
the
traffic
at
large
we
are
to
secure
all
loose
objects
hood
up
our
fleury
rays
and
on
no
account
to
attempt
to
clear
snow
from
our
till
the
weather
craft
we
are
told
can
ascend
to
the
limit
of
their
lift
to
look
out
for
them
accordingly
the
lower
lanes
westward
are
pitting
very
badly
with
frequent
vortices
laterals
still
the
clear
dark
holds
up
unblemished
the
only
warning
is
the
electric
i
feel
as
though
i
were
a
pillow
and
an
irritability
which
the
gibbering
of
the
general
communicator
increases
almost
to
hysteria
we
have
made
eight
thousand
feet
since
we
pithed
the
tramp
and
our
turbines
are
giving
us
an
honest
two
hundred
and
ten
knots
very
far
to
the
west
an
elongated
blur
of
red
low
down
shows
us
the
north
banks
mark
boat
there
are
specks
of
fire
round
her
rising
and
falling
bewildered
planets
about
an
unstable
sun
helpless
shipping
hanging
on
to
her
light
for
company
sake
no
wonder
she
could
not
quit
station
she
warns
us
to
look
out
for
the
of
the
bad
vortex
in
which
her
beam
shows
it
she
is
even
now
reeling
the
pits
of
gloom
about
us
begin
to
fill
with
very
faintly
luminous
films
wreathing
and
uneasy
shapes
one
forms
itself
into
a
globe
of
pale
flame
that
waits
shivering
with
eagerness
till
we
sweep
by
it
leaps
monstrously
across
the
blackness
alights
on
the
precise
tip
of
our
nose
pirouettes
there
an
instant
and
swings
off
our
roaring
bow
sinks
as
though
that
light
were
lead
sinks
and
recovers
to
lurch
and
stumble
again
beneath
the
next
tim
fingers
on
the
strike
chords
of
numbers
and
so
on
for
he
is
running
by
his
tanks
only
lifting
or
lowering
her
against
the
uneasy
air
all
three
engines
are
at
work
for
the
sooner
we
have
skated
over
this
thin
ice
the
better
higher
we
dare
not
go
the
whole
upper
vault
is
charged
with
pale
krypton
vapours
which
our
skin
friction
may
excite
to
unholy
manifestations
between
the
upper
and
lower
levels
and
hints
the
mark
boat
we
may
perhaps
bolt
through
if
our
bow
clothes
itself
in
blue
flame
and
falls
like
a
sword
no
human
skill
can
keep
pace
with
the
changing
tensions
a
vortex
has
us
by
the
beak
and
we
dive
down
a
foot
slant
at
an
angle
the
and
my
bouncing
body
record
it
of
our
turbines
scream
shrilly
the
propellers
can
not
bite
on
the
thin
air
tim
shunts
the
lift
out
of
five
tanks
at
once
and
by
sheer
weight
drives
her
bullet
wise
through
the
maelstrom
till
she
cushions
with
jar
on
an
three
thousand
feet
below
now
we
done
it
says
george
in
my
ear
our
that
last
slide
has
played
old
harry
with
the
tensions
look
out
for
laterals
tim
she
want
some
i
got
her
is
the
answer
come
up
old
she
comes
up
nobly
but
the
laterals
buffet
her
left
and
right
like
the
pinions
of
angry
angels
she
is
jolted
off
her
course
four
ways
at
once
and
cuffed
into
place
again
only
to
be
swung
aside
and
dropped
into
a
new
chaos
we
are
never
without
a
corposant
grinning
on
our
bows
or
rolling
head
over
heels
from
nose
to
midships
and
to
the
crackle
of
electricity
around
and
within
us
is
added
once
or
twice
the
rattle
of
hail
hail
that
will
never
fall
on
any
sea
slow
we
must
or
we
may
break
our
back
air
a
perfectly
elastic
fluid
roars
george
above
the
tumult
about
as
elastic
as
a
head
sea
off
the
fastnet
ai
it
he
is
less
than
just
to
the
good
element
if
one
intrudes
on
the
heavens
when
they
are
balancing
their
if
one
disturbs
the
high
gods
by
hurling
steel
hulls
at
ninety
knots
across
tremblingly
adjusted
electric
tensions
one
must
not
complain
of
any
rudeness
in
the
reception
tim
met
it
with
an
unmoved
countenance
one
corner
of
his
under
lip
caught
up
on
a
tooth
his
eyes
fleeting
into
the
blackness
twenty
miles
ahead
and
the
fierce
sparks
flying
from
his
knuckles
at
every
turn
of
the
hand
now
and
again
he
shook
his
head
to
clear
the
sweat
trickling
from
his
eyebrows
and
it
was
then
that
george
watching
his
chance
would
slide
down
the
and
swab
his
face
quickly
with
a
big
red
handkerchief
i
never
imagined
that
a
human
being
could
so
continuously
labour
and
so
collectedly
think
as
did
tim
through
that
hell
when
the
flurry
was
at
its
worst
we
were
dragged
hither
and
yon
by
warm
or
frozen
suctions
belched
up
on
the
tops
of
spun
down
by
vortices
and
clubbed
aside
by
laterals
under
a
dizzying
rush
of
stars
in
the
company
of
a
drunken
moon
i
heard
the
rushing
click
of
the
sliding
in
and
out
the
low
growl
of
the
and
louder
than
the
yelling
winds
without
the
scream
of
the
gouging
into
any
lull
that
promised
hold
for
an
instant
at
last
we
began
to
claw
up
on
a
cant
and
together
only
the
nicest
balancing
of
tanks
saved
us
from
spinning
like
the
of
the
old
days
we
got
to
hitch
to
windward
of
that
mark
boat
somehow
george
cried
there
no
windward
i
protested
feebly
where
i
swung
shackled
to
a
stanchion
how
can
there
be
he
laughed
as
we
pitched
into
a
thousand
foot
that
red
man
laughed
beneath
his
inflated
hood
look
he
said
we
must
clear
those
refugees
with
a
high
the
mark
boat
was
below
and
a
little
to
the
of
us
fluctuating
in
the
centre
of
her
distraught
galaxy
the
air
was
thick
with
moving
lights
at
every
level
i
take
it
most
of
them
were
trying
to
lie
head
to
wind
but
not
being
hydras
they
failed
an
moghrabi
boat
had
risen
to
the
limit
of
her
lift
and
finding
no
improvement
had
dropped
a
couple
of
thousand
there
she
met
a
superb
and
was
blown
up
spinning
like
a
dead
leaf
instead
of
shutting
off
she
went
astern
and
naturally
rebounded
as
from
a
wall
almost
into
the
mark
boat
whose
language
our
took
it
in
was
humanly
simple
if
they
only
ride
it
out
quietly
it
be
better
said
george
in
a
calm
while
we
climbed
like
a
bat
above
them
all
but
some
skippers
will
navigate
without
enough
lift
what
does
that
think
she
is
doing
tim
playin
kiss
in
the
ring
was
tim
unmoved
reply
a
direct
liner
had
found
a
smooth
and
butted
into
it
full
power
but
there
was
a
vortex
at
the
tail
of
that
smooth
so
the
was
flipped
out
like
a
pea
from
off
a
braking
madly
as
she
fled
down
and
all
but
now
i
hope
she
satisfied
said
tim
i
glad
i
not
a

do
i
want
help
the
general
communicator
dial
had
caught
his
ear
george
you
may
tell
that
gentleman
with
my
love
love
remember
george
that
i
do
not
want
help
who

very
kind
of

at

the
insurrection
of
the
airs
through
which
we
tore
our
way
he
lay
in
absolute
peace
i
saw
the
smoke
of
his
pipe
ascend
untroubled
ere
his
boat
dropped
it
seemed
like
a
stone
in
a
well
we
had
just
cleared
the
mark
boat
and
her
disorderly
neighbours
when
the
storm
ended
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
a
to
northward
filled
the
sky
with
the
green
blink
of
a
meteorite
dissipating
itself
in
our
atmosphere
said
george
that
may
iron
out
all
the
even
as
he
spoke
the
conflicting
winds
came
to
rest
the
levels
filled
the
laterals
died
out
in
long
easy
swells
the
were
smoothed
before
us
in
less
than
three
minutes
the
covey
round
the
mark
boat
had
shipped
their
and
whirred
away
upon
their
businesses
what
happened
i
gasped
the
within
and
the
without
had
passed
my
inflators
weighed
like
lead
god
he
knows
said
captain
george
soberly
that
old
has
discharged
the
different
levels
i
seen
it
happen
before
phew
what
a
relief
we
dropped
from
ten
to
six
thousand
and
got
rid
of
our
clammy
suits
tim
shut
off
and
stepped
out
of
the
frame
the
mark
boat
was
coming
up
behind
us
he
opened
the
colloid
in
that
heavenly
stillness
and
mopped
his
face
hello
williams
he
cried
a
degree
or
two
out
o
station
you
may
be
was
the
answer
from
the
mark
boat
i
had
some
company
this
so
i
noticed
was
that
quite
a
little
draught
i
warned
you
why
did
you
pull
out
north
the
packets
me
not
till
i
running
a
polar
consumptives
sanatorium
boat
i
was
squinting
through
a
colloid
before
you
were
out
of
your
cradle
my
i
be
the
last
man
to
deny
it
the
captain
of
the
mark
boat
replies
softly
the
way
you
handled
her
just
now
i
a
pretty
fair
judge
of
traffic
in
a
it
was
a
thousand
revolutions
beyond
anything
even
i
ever
tim
back
supples
visibly
to
this
oiling
captain
george
on
the
winks
and
points
to
the
portrait
of
a
singularly
attractive
maiden
pinned
up
on
tim
telescope
bracket
above
the
i
see
wholly
and
entirely
do
i
see
there
is
some
talk
overhead
of
coming
round
to
tea
on
friday
a
brief
report
of
the
derelict
fate
and
tim
volunteers
as
he
descends
for
an
a
man
young
williams
is
less
of
a
fool
than
some
were
you
thinking
of
taking
her
on
george
then
i
just
have
a
look
round
that
seems
to
me
it
a
trifle
warm
and
we
jog
the
mark
boat
hums
off
joyously
and
hangs
herself
up
in
her
appointed
eyrie
here
she
will
stay
a
shutterless
observatory
a
station
a
salvage
tug
a
court
of
ultimate
bureau
for
three
hundred
miles
in
all
directions
till
wednesday
next
when
her
relief
slides
across
the
stars
to
take
her
buffeted
place
her
black
hull
double
and
slings
represent
all
that
remains
to
the
planet
of
that
odd
old
word
authority
she
is
responsible
only
to
the
aerial
board
of
control
the
a
of
which
tim
speaks
so
flippantly
but
that
body
of
a
few
score
of
persons
of
both
sexes
controls
this
planet
transportation
is
civilisation
our
motto
runs
theoretically
we
do
what
we
please
so
long
as
we
do
not
interfere
with
the
traffic
and
all
it
implies
practically
the
a
confirms
or
annuls
all
international
arrangements
and
to
judge
from
its
last
report
finds
our
tolerant
humorous
lazy
little
planet
only
too
ready
to
shift
the
whole
burden
of
public
administration
on
its
shoulders
i
discuss
this
with
tim
sipping
mate
on
the
while
george
fans
her
along
over
the
white
blur
of
the
banks
in
beautiful
upward
curves
of
fifty
miles
each
the
translates
them
on
the
tape
in
flowing
freehand
tim
gathers
up
a
skein
of
it
and
surveys
the
last
few
feet
which
record
path
through
the
i
have
had
a
like
this
to
show
up
in
five
years
he
says
ruefully
a
postal
packet
records
every
yard
of
every
run
the
tapes
then
go
to
the
a
which
collates
and
makes
composite
photographs
of
them
for
the
instruction
of
captains
tim
studies
his
irrevocable
past
shaking
his
head
hello
here
a
drop
at
degrees
we
must
have
been
standing
on
our
heads
then
you
do
say
so
george
answers
i
fancied
i
noticed
it
at
the
george
may
not
have
captain
purnall
catlike
swiftness
but
he
is
all
an
artist
to
the
tips
of
the
broad
fingers
that
play
on
the
the
delicious
come
away
on
the
tape
with
never
a
waver
the
mark
boat
vertical
spindle
of
light
lies
down
to
eastward
setting
in
the
face
of
the
following
stars
westward
where
no
planet
should
rise
the
triple
verticals
of
trinity
bay
we
keep
still
to
the
southern
route
make
a
haze
we
seem
the
only
thing
at
rest
under
all
the
heavens
floating
at
ease
till
the
earth
revolution
shall
turn
up
our
and
minute
by
minute
our
silent
clock
gives
us
a
mile
some
fine
night
says
tim
we
be
even
with
that
clock
he
coming
now
says
george
over
his
shoulder
i
chasing
the
night
the
stars
ahead
dim
no
more
than
if
a
film
of
mist
had
been
drawn
under
unobserved
but
the
deep
airboom
on
our
skin
changes
to
a
joyful
shout
the
says
tim
it
go
on
to
meet
the
sun
look
look
there
the
dark
being
crammed
back
over
our
bows
come
to
the
i
show
you
the
is
hot
and
stuffy
the
clerks
in
the
coach
are
asleep
and
the
slave
of
the
ray
is
ready
to
follow
them
tim
slides
open
the
aft
colloid
and
reveals
the
curve
of
the
world
the
ocean
deepest
purple
edged
with
fuming
and
intolerable
gold
then
the
sun
rises
and
through
the
colloid
strikes
out
our
lamps
tim
scowls
in
his
face
squirrels
in
a
cage
he
mutters
that
all
we
are
squirrels
in
a
cage
he
going
twice
as
fast
as
us
just
you
wait
a
few
years
my
shining
friend
and
we
take
steps
that
will
amaze
you
we
joshua
you
yes
that
is
our
dream
to
turn
all
earth
into
the
yale
of
ajalon
at
our
pleasure
so
far
we
can
drag
out
the
dawn
to
twice
its
normal
length
in
these
latitudes
but
some
day
even
on
the
equator
we
shall
hold
the
sun
level
in
his
full
stride
now
we
look
down
on
a
sea
thronged
with
heavy
traffic
a
big
submersible
breaks
water
suddenly
another
and
another
follows
with
a
swash
and
a
suck
and
a
savage
bubbling
of
relieved
pressures
the
freighters
are
rising
to
lung
up
after
the
long
night
and
the
leisurely
ocean
is
all
patterned
with
peacock
eyes
of
foam
we
lung
up
too
says
tim
and
when
we
return
to
the
george
shuts
off
the
colloids
are
opened
and
the
fresh
air
sweeps
her
out
there
is
no
hurry
the
old
contracts
they
will
be
revised
at
the
end
of
the
year
allow
twelve
hours
for
a
run
which
any
packet
can
put
behind
her
in
ten
so
we
breakfast
in
the
arms
of
an
easterly
slant
which
pushes
us
along
at
a
languid
twenty
to
enjoy
life
and
tobacco
begin
both
on
a
sunny
morning
half
a
mile
or
so
above
the
dappled
atlantic
and
after
a
which
has
cleared
and
tempered
your
nerves
while
we
discussed
the
thickening
traffic
with
the
superiority
that
comes
of
having
a
high
level
reserved
to
ourselves
we
heard
and
i
for
the
first
time
the
morning
hymn
on
a
hospital
boat
she
was
cloaked
by
a
skein
of
ravelled
fluff
beneath
us
and
we
caught
the
chant
before
she
rose
into
the
sunlight
oh
ye
winds
of
god
sang
the
unseen
voices
bless
ye
the
lord
praise
him
and
magnify
him
for
ever
we
slid
off
our
caps
and
joined
in
when
our
shadow
fell
across
her
great
open
platforms
they
looked
up
and
stretched
out
their
hands
neighbourly
while
they
sang
we
could
see
the
doctors
and
the
nurses
and
the
faces
of
the
she
passed
slowly
beneath
us
heading
northward
her
hull
wet
with
the
dews
of
the
night
all
ablaze
in
the
sunshine
so
took
she
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
and
vanished
her
song
continuing
oh
ye
holy
and
humble
men
of
heart
bless
ye
the
lord
praise
him
and
magnify
him
for
she
a
public
lunger
or
she
would
have
been
singing
the
benedicite
and
she
a
greenlander
or
she
would
have
over
her
colloids
said
george
at
last
she
be
bound
for
frederikshavn
or
one
of
the
glacier
sanatoriums
for
a
month
if
she
was
an
accident
ward
she
be
hung
up
at
the
level
yes
funny
how
the
new
things
are
the
old
thing
i
read
in
books
tim
answered
that
savages
used
to
haul
their
sick
and
wounded
up
to
the
tops
of
hills
because
microbes
were
fewer
there
we
hoist
in
sterilized
air
for
a
while
same
idea
how
much
do
the
doctors
say
added
to
the
average
life
of
man
thirty
years
says
george
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
are
we
going
to
spend
all
up
here
tim
flap
ahead
then
flap
ahead
who
hindering
the
senior
captain
laughed
as
we
went
in
we
held
a
good
lift
to
clear
the
coastwise
and
continental
shipping
and
we
had
need
of
it
though
our
route
is
in
no
sense
a
populated
one
there
is
a
steady
trickle
of
traffic
this
way
along
we
met
hudson
bay
furriers
out
of
the
great
preserve
hurrying
to
make
their
departure
from
bonavista
with
sable
and
black
fox
for
the
insatiable
markets
we
overcossed
keewatin
liners
small
and
cramped
but
their
captains
who
see
no
land
between
trepassy
and
lanco
know
what
gold
they
bring
back
from
west
erica
directs
we
met
soberly
ringing
the
world
round
the
fiftieth
meridian
at
an
honest
seventy
knots
and
ackroyd
hunt
fruiters
out
of
the
south
fled
beneath
us
their
ventilated
hulls
whistling
like
chinese
kites
their
market
is
in
the
north
among
the
northern
sanatoria
where
you
can
smell
their
and
bananas
across
the
cold
snows
argentine
beef
boats
we
sighted
too
of
enormous
capacity
and
unlovely
outline
they
too
feed
the
northern
health
stations
in
icebound
ports
where
submersibles
dare
not
rise
and
ungava
punted
down
leisurely
out
of
the
north
like
strings
of
unfrightened
wild
duck
it
does
not
pay
to
fly
minerals
and
oil
a
mile
farther
than
is
necessary
but
the
risks
of
transhipping
to
submersibles
in
the
ice
pack
off
nain
or
hebron
are
so
great
that
these
heavy
freighters
fly
down
to
halifax
direct
and
scent
the
air
as
they
go
they
are
the
biggest
tramps
aloft
except
the
athabasca
but
these
last
now
that
the
wheat
is
moved
are
busy
over
the
world
shoulder
in
siberia
we
held
to
the
lawrence
it
is
astonishing
how
the
old
still
pull
us
children
of
the
air
and
followed
his
broad
line
of
black
between
its
drifting
iceblocks
all
down
the
park
that
the
wisdom
of
our
fathers
but
every
one
knows
the
quebec
run
we
dropped
to
the
heights
receiving
towers
twenty
minutes
ahead
of
time
and
there
hung
at
ease
till
the
yokohama
intermediate
packet
could
pull
out
and
give
us
our
proper
slip
it
was
curious
to
watch
the
action
of
the
clips
all
along
the
frosty
river
front
as
the
boats
cleared
or
came
to
rest
a
big
hamburger
was
leaving
pont
levis
and
her
crew
unshipping
the
platform
railings
began
to
sing
elsinore
the
oldest
of
our
chanteys
you
know
it
of
course
mother
rugen
on
the
baltic
forty
couple
waltzing
on
the
floor
and
you
can
watch
my
ray
for
i
must
go
away
and
dance
with
ella
sweyn
at
elsinore
then
while
they
sweated
home
the
west
from
sourabaya
to
the
baltic
ninety
knot
an
hour
to
the
skaw
mother
rugen
on
the
baltic
and
a
dance
with
ella
sweyn
at
elsinore
the
clips
parted
with
a
gesture
of
indignant
dismissal
as
though
quebec
glittering
under
her
snows
were
casting
out
these
light
and
unworthy
lovers
our
signal
came
from
the
heights
tim
turned
and
floated
up
but
surely
then
it
was
with
passionate
appeal
that
the
great
tower
arms
flung
open
or
did
i
think
so
because
on
the
upper
staging
a
little
hooded
figure
also
opened
her
arms
wide
toward
her
father
in
ten
seconds
the
coach
with
its

clashed
down
to
the
the
hostlers
displaced
the

at

have
held
up
a
badly
balanced
plane
in
a
know
what
that
means
and
the
latter
from
loaded
bows
and
bodies
as
a
consequence
the
northern
and
upper
levels
have
been
practically
abandoned
and
the
high
fliers
have
returned
to
the
ignoble
security
of
the
three
five
and
six
hundred
foot
levels
but
there
remain
a
few
undaunted
who
in
spite
of
frozen
stays
and
still
haunt
the
blue
empyrean
racing
the
scandals
of
the
past
few
years
have
at
last
moved
the
yachting
world
to
concerted
action
in
regard
to
bat
boat
racing
we
have
been
treated
to
the
spectacle
of
what
are
practically
keeled
driven
a
clear
five
foot
or
more
above
the
water
and
only
eased
down
to
touch
their
native
element
as
they
near
the
line
judges
and
starters
have
been
conveniently
blind
to
this
absurdity
but
the
public
demonstration
off
catherine
light
at
the
autumn
regattas
has
borne
ample
if
tardy
fruit
in
the
future
the
bat
is
to
be
a
boat
and
the
demand
of
the
true
sportsman
for
no
daylight
under
in
smooth
water
is
in
a
fair
way
to
be
conceded
the
new
rule
severely
restricts
plane
area
and
lift
alike
the
gas
compartments
are
permitted
both
fore
and
aft
as
in
the
old
type
but
the
central
tank
is
rendered
obligatory
these
things
work
if
not
for
perfection
at
least
for
the
evolution
of
a
sane
and
wholesome
waterborne
cruiser
the
type
of
rudder
is
unaffected
by
the
new
rules
so
we
may
expect
to
see
the
make
the
patent
on
which
has
just
expired
come
largely
into
use
henceforward
though
the
strain
on
the
sternpost
in
turning
at
speeds
over
forty
miles
an
hour
is
admittedly
very
severe
but
racing
has
a
great
future
before
it
crete
and
the
a
the
story
of
the
recent
cretan
crisis
as
told
in
the
a
monthly
report
is
not
without
humour
till
the

crete
as
all
our

knows
was
the
sole

of

has
lived
practically
on
the

traffic
attracted
by
her
annual
pageants
of
parliaments
boards
municipal
councils
etc
last
summer
the
islanders
grew
wearied
as
their
premier
explained
of
playing
at
being
savages
for
pennies
and
proceeded
to
pull
down
all
the

the
island
and
shut
off

communication
till
such
time
as
the

should
annex

for

we
would
refer
our

to
the

between

ends

the

on

and
tourists
must
go
elsewhere
to
witness
the

and
popular
movements
of
the
old
days
the
only
people
to
suffer
will
be
the
board
of

which
is
grievously
overworked
already
it
is
easy
enough
to
condemn
the
cretans
for
their
laziness
but
when
one
recalls
the

during

only
last

i
became
aware
of
a
furious
and
irregular
cannonading
some
fifteen
or
twenty

descending
to

i
found
a
party
of

in
the

of
their

this
orgie

can
give
it
no

went
on
for
at

two
hours
and
naturally
produced
violent

my

thrown
out
my

was
struck
twice

i
received
two
brisk
shocks
from
the
lower
on
remonstrating
i
was
told
that
these
professors
were
engaged
in
scientific
experiments
the
extent
of
their
scientific
knowledge
may
be
judged
by
the
fact
that
they
expected
to
produce

give
their

if
they
went
on

this
in

i
have
no
objection
to
any

of

in
its

it
can
be
found
at

twelve

with

the

that

the
life
of
xavier
lavalle
reviewed
by
rene
talland
ecole
aeronautique
paris
ten
years
ago
lavalle
that
imperturbable
dreamer
of
the
heavens
as
lazareff
hailed
him
gathered
together
the
fruits
of
a
labour
and
gave
it
with
contempt
to
a
world
bound
hand
and
foot
to
barald
theory
of
vertices
and
compensating
electric
they
shall
see
he
wrote
in
that
immortal
postscript
to
the
heart
of
the
cyclone
the
laws
whose
existence
they
derided
written
in
fire
beneath
but
even
here
he
continues
there
is
no
finality
better
a
thousand
times
my
conclusions
should
be
discredited
than
that
my
dead
name
should
lie
across
the
threshold
of
the
temple
of
science
a
bar
to
further
so
died
lavalle
a
prince
of
the
powers
of
the
air
and
even
at
his
funeral
cellier
jested
at
him
who
had
gone
to
discover
the
secrets
of
the
aurora
if
i
choose
thus
to
be
banal
it
is
only
to
remind
you
that
theories
are
today
as
exploded
as
the
ludicrous
deductions
of
the
spanish
school
in
the
place
of
their
fugitive
and
warring
dreams
we
have
definitely
lavalle
law
of
the
cyclone
which
he
surprised
in
darkness
and
cold
at
the
foot
of
the
overarching
throne
of
the
aurora
borealis
it
is
there
that
i
intent
on
my
own
investigations
have
passed
and
a
hundred
times
the
worn
leonine
face
white
as
the
snow
beneath

master
i
would
cry
as
i
moved
respectfully
beneath
him
what
is
it
you
seek
today
and
always
the
answer
clear
and
without
doubt
from
above
the
old
secret
my
son
the
immense
egotism
of
youth
forced
me
on
my
own
path
but
cry
of
the
human
always
had
i
known
if
i

would
many

bartered
my
poor
laurels
for
the
privilege
such
as
tinsley
and
herrera
possess
of
having
aided
him
in
his
monumental
researches
it
is
to
the
filial
piety
of
victor
lavalle
that
we
owe
the
two
volumes
consecrated
to
the
of
his
father
so
full
of
the
holy
intimacies
of
the
domestic
hearth
once
returned
from
the
abysms
of
the
utter
north
to
that
little
house
upon
the
outskirts
of
meudon
it
was
not
the
philosopher
the
daring
observer
the
man
of
iron
energy
that
imposed
himself
on
his
family
but
a
fat
and
even
plaintive
jester
a
farceur
incarnate
and
kindly
the
of
his

and
it
must
be
written
not

comic
despair
of
madame

as
she
writes
five
years
after
the
marriage
to
her
venerable

unequalled

us
of

historic
collision

on
the
flank
of

between
herrera
then
a

of
the
spanish
school
and
the
man
destined
to
confute
his

and
lead
him
intellectually
captive
even
through
the
years
the
immense
laugh
of
lavalle
as
he
sustains
the
spaniard
wrecked
plane
and
cries
courage
i
shall
not
fall
till
i
have
found
truth
and
i
hold
you
fast
rings
like
the
call
of
trumpets
this
is
that
lavalle
whom
the
world
immersed
in
speculations
of
immediate
gain
did
not
know
nor
suspect
the
lavalle
whom
they
adjudged
to
the
last
a
pedant
and
a
theorist
the
human
as
apart
from
the
scientific
side
developed
in
his
own
volumes
of
his
discoveries
is
marked
with
a
simplicity
clarity
and
good
sense
beyond
praise
i
would
specially
refer
such
as
doubt
the
sustaining
influence
of
ancestral
faith
upon
character
and
will
to
the
eleventh
and
nineteenth
chapters
in
which
are
contained
the
opening
and
consummation
of
the
tellurionical
records
extending
over
nine
years
of
their
tremendous
significance
be
sure
that
the
modest
house
at
meudon
knew
as
little
as
that
the
records
would
one
day
be
the
planet
standard
in
all
official
meteorology
it
was
enough
for
them
that
their
xavier
this
son
this
father
this
husband
ascended
periodically
to
commune
with
powers
it
might
be
angelic
beyond
their
comprehension
and
that
they
united
daily
in
prayers
for
his
safety
pray
for
me
he
says
upon
the
eve
of
each
of
his
excursions
and
returning
with
an
equal
simplicity
he
renders
thanks
after
supper
in
the
little
room
where
he
kept
his
to
the
last
lavalle
was
a
catholic
of
the
old
school
accepting
he
who
had
looked
into
the
very
heart
of
the
lightnings
the
dogmas
of
papal
infallibility
of
absolution
of
confession
of
relics
great
and
small
marvellous
enviable
contradiction
the
completion
of
the
tellurionical
records
closed
what
lavalle
himself
was
pleased
to
call
the
theoretical
side
of
his
labours
labours
from
which
the
youngest
and
least
impressionable
planeur
might
well
have
shrunk
he
had
traced
through
cold
and
heat
across
the
deeps
of
the
oceans
with
instruments
of
his
own
invention
over
the
inhospitable
heart
of
the
polar
ice
and
the
sterile
visage
of
the
deserts
league
by
league
patiently
unweariedly
remorselessly
from
their
cradle
under
the
magnetic
pole
to
their
exalted
in
the
utmost
ether
of
the
upper
atmosphere
each
one
of
the
isoconical
tellurions
lavalle
curves
as
we
call
them
today
he
had
disentangled
the
nodes
of
their
intersections
assigning
to
each
its
regulated
period
of
flux
and
reflux
thus
equipped
he
summons
herrera
and
tinsley
his
pupils
to
the
final
demonstration
as
calmly
as
though
he
were
ordering
his
flighter
for
some
journey
to
marseilles
i
have
proved
my
thesis
he
writes
it
remains
now
only
that
you
should
witness
the
proof
we
go
to
manila
a
cyclone
will
form
off
the
pescadores
in
four
days
and
will
reach
its
maximum
intensity
hours
after
inception
it
is
there
i
will
show
you
the
a
letter
heretofore
unpublished
from
herrera
to
madame
lavalle
tells
us
how
the
master
prophecy
was
verified
i
will
not
destroy
its
simplicity
or
its
significance
by
any
attempt
to
quote
note
well
though
that
herrera
preoccupation
throughout
that
day
and
night
of
superhuman
strain
is
always
for
the
master
bodily
health
and
comfort
at
such
a
time
he
writes
i
forced
the
master
to
take
the
broth
or
i
made
him
put
on
the
fur
coat
as
you
told
nor
is
tinsley
see
pp
less
concerned
he
prepares
the
nourishment
he
cooks
eternally
imperturbably
suspended
in
the
chaos
of
which
the
master
interprets
the
meaning
tinsley
bowed
down
with
the
laurels
of
both
hemispheres
raises
himself
to
yet
nobler
heights
in
his
capacity
of
a
devoted
chef
it
is
almost
unbelievable
and
yet
men
write
of
the
master
as
cold
aloof
such
characters
do
not
elicit
the
joyous
and
unswerving
devotion
which
lavalle
commanded
throughout
life
truly
we
have
changed
very
little
in
the
course
of
the
ages
the
secrets
of
earth
and
sky
and
the
links
that

them
we

cut

long
and
long
ago
when
devadatta
was
king
of
benares
i
wrote
some
tales
concerning
strickland
of
the
punjab
police
who
married
miss
youghal
and
adam
his
son
strickland
has
finished
his
indian
service
and
lives
now
at
a
place
in
england
called
where
his
wife
plays
the
organ
in
one
of
the
churches
he
comes
up
to
london
and
occasionally
his
wife
makes
him
visit
his
friends
otherwise
he
plays
golf
and
follows
the
harriers
for
his
figure
sake
if
you
remember
that
infant
who
told
a
tale
to
eustace
cleever
the
novelist
you
will
remember
that
he
became
a
baronet
with
a
vast
estate
he
has
owing
to
cookery
a
little
lost
his
figure
but
he
never
loses
his
friends
i
have
found
a
wing
of
his
house
turned
into
a
hospital
for
sick
men
and
there
i
once
spent
a
week
in
the
company
of
two
dismal
nurses
and
a
specialist
in
another
time
the
place
was
full
of
schoolboys
sons
of
whom
the
infant
had
collected
for
the
holidays
and
they
nearly
broke
his
keeper
heart
but
my
last
visit
was
better
the
infant
called
me
up
by
wire
and
i
fell
into
the
arms
of
a
friend
of
mine
colonel
corkran
so
that
the
years
departed
from
us
and
we
praised
allah
who
had
not
yet
terminated
the
delights
nor
separated
the
companions
said
corkran
when
he
had
explained
how
it
felt
to
command
a
native
infantry
regiment
on
the
border
the
stricks
are
coming
for
their
i
remember
him
the
little
fellow
i
wrote
a
story
about
i
said
is
he
in
the
service
no
strick
got
him
into
the
protectorate
at
dupe
wherever
that
is
somaliland
ai
it
stalky
asked
the
infant
stalky
puffed
out
his
nostrils
scornfully
you
only
three
thousand
miles
out
look
at
the
anyhow
he
as
rotten
full
of
fever
as
the
rest
of
you
said
the
infant
at
length
on
the
big
divan
and
he
bringing
a
native
servant
with
him
stalky
be
an
athlete
and
tell
ipps
to
put
him
in
the
stable
why
is
he
a
yao
like
the
fellow
wade
brought
here
when
your
housekeeper
had
fits
stalky
often
visits
the
infant
and
has
seen
some
odd
things

the
porch
and
the
first
to
enter
was
agnes
strickland
whom
the
infant
makes
no
secret
of
adoring
he
is
devoted
in
a
fat
man
placid
way
to
at
least
eight
designing
women
but
she
nursed
him
once
through
a
bad
bout
of
peshawur
fever
and
when
she
is
in
the
house
it
is
more
than
all
hers
you
did
send
rugs
enough
she
began
adam
might
have
taken
a
it
quite
warm
in
the
tonneau
why
did
you
let
him
ride
in
front
because
he
wanted
to
she
replied
with
the
mother
smile
and
we
were
introduced
to
the
shadow
of
a
young
man
leaning
heavily
on
the
shoulder
of
a
bearded
punjabi
mohammedan
that
is
all
that
came
home
of
him
said
his
father
to
me
there
was
nothing
in
it
of
the
child
with
whom
i
had
journeyed
to
dalhousie
centuries
and
what
is
this
uniform
stalky
asked
of
imam
din
the
servant
who
came
to
attention
on
the
marble
floor
the
uniform
of
the
protectorate
troops
sahib
though
i
am
the
little
sahib
it
is
not
seemly
for
us
white
men
to
be
attended
by
folk
dressed
altogether
as
and
and
you
white
men
wait
at
table
on
horseback
stalky
pointed
to
the
man
spurs
these
i
added
for
the
sake
of
honour
when
i
came
to
england
said
imam
din
adam
smiled
the
ghost
of
a
little
smile
that
i
began
to
remember
and
we
put
him
on
the
big
couch
for
refreshments
stalky
asked
him
how
much
leave
he
had
and
he
said
six
but
he
take
another
six
on
medical
certificate
said
agnes
anxiously
adam
knit
his
brows
you
do
want
to
eh
i
know
wonder
what
my
second
in
command
is
stalky
tugged
his
moustache
and
fell
to
thinking
of
his
sikhs
ah
said
the
infant
i
only
a
few
thousand
pheasants
to
look
after
come
along
and
dress
for
dinner
we
just
ourselves
what
flower
is
your
honour
ladyship
commanding
for
the
table
just
ourselves
she
said
looking
at
the
crotons
in
the
great
hall
then
let
have
marigolds
the
little
cemetery
so
it
was
ordered
now
marigolds
to
us
mean
hot
weather
discomfort
parting
and
death
that
smell
in
our
nostrils
and
adam
servant
in
waiting
we
naturally
fell
back
more
and
more
on
the
old
slang
recalling
at
each
glass
those
who
had
gone
before
we
did
not
sit
at
the
big
table
but
in
the
bay
window
overlooking
the
park
where
they
were
carting
the
last
of
the
hay
when
twilight
fell
we
would
not
have
candles
but
waited
for
the
moon
and
continued
our
talk
in
the
dusk
that
makes
one
remember
young
adam
was
not
interested
in
our
past
except
where
it
had
touched
his
future
i
think
his
mother
held
his
hand
beneath
the
table
imam
din
shoeless
out
of
respect
to
the
floors
brought
him
his
medicine
poured
it
drop
by
drop
and
asked
for
orders
wait
to
take
him
to
his
cot
when
he
grows
weary
said
his
mother
and
imam
din
retired
into
the
shadow
by
the
ancestral
portraits
now
what
expect
to
get
out
of
your
country
the
infant
asked
when
our
india
laid
aside
we
talked
adam
africa
it
roused
him
at
once
rubber
nuts
gums
and
so
on
he
said
but
our
real
future
is
cotton
i
grew
fifty
acres
of
it
last
year
in
my
my
district
said
his
father
hear
him
mummy
i
did
though
i
wish
i
could
show
you
the
sample
some
manchester
chaps
said
it
was
as
good
as
any
sea
island
cotton
on
the
but
what
made
you
a
my
son
she
asked
my
chief
said
every
man
ought
to
have
a
shouk
a
hobby
of
sorts
and
he
took
the
trouble
to
ride
a
day
out
of
his
way
to
show
me
a
belt
of
black
soil
that
was
just
the
thing
for
ah
what
was
your
chief
like
stalky
asked
in
his
silkiest
tones
the
best
man
alive
absolutely
he
lets
you
blow
your
own
nose
yourself
the
people
call
him
adam
jerked
out
some
heathen
phrase
that
means
the
man
with
the
stone
eyes
you
i
glad
of
that
because
i
heard
from
other
quarters
sentence
burned
like
a
slow
match
but
the
explosion
was
not
long
delayed
other
quarters
adam
threw
out
a
thin
hand
every
dog
has
his
fleas
if
you
listen
to
them
of
course
the
shake
of
his
head
was
as
i
remembered
it
among
his
father
policemen
twenty
years
before
and
his
mother
eyes
shining
through
the
dusk
called
on
me
to
adore
it
i
kicked
stalky
on
the
shin
one
must
not
mock
a
young
man
first
love
or
loyalty
a
lump
of
raw
cotton
appeared
on
the
table
i
thought
there
might
be
a
need
therefore
i
packed
it
between
our
shirts
said
the
voice
of
imam
din
does
he
know
as
much
english
as
that
cried
the
infant
who
had
forgotten
his
east
we
all
admired
the
cotton
for
adam
sake
and
indeed
it
was
very
long
and
glossy
it
it
only
an
experiment
he
said
we
such
awful
paupers
we
ca
even
pay
for
a
mailcart
in
my
district
we
use
a
on
two
bicycle
wheels
i
only
got
the
money
for
that
he
patted
the
stuff
by
a
pure
how
much
did
it
cost
asked
strickland
with
seed
and
machinery
about
two
hundred
pounds
i
had
the
labour
done
by
that
sounds
stalky
reached
for
a
fresh
cigarette
no
thank
you
said
agnes
i
been
at
a
little
too
long
for
cannibals
i
go
to
the
and
try
over
next
sunday
she
lifted
the
boy
hand
lightly
to
her
lips
and
tripped
across
the
acres
of
glimmering
floor
to
the
that
had
been
the
ancestors
banqueting
hall
her
grey
and
silver
dress
disappeared
under
the
musicians
gallery
two
electrics
broke
out
and
she
stood
backed
against
the
lines
of
gilded
pipes
there
an
abominable
attachment
here
she
called
me
the
infant
answered
his
napkin
on
his
shoulder
that
how
i
play
i
prefer
the
direct
expression
take
it
away
we
heard
old
ipps
skating
obediently
all
over
the
floor
now
for
the
direct
expression
said
stalky
and
moved
on
the
burgundy
recommended
by
the
faculty
to
enrich
blood
it
nothing
much
only
the
belt
of
my
chief
showed
me
ran
right
into
the
sheshaheli
country
we
have
been
able
to
prove
cannibalism
against
that
tribe
in
the
courts
but
when
a
sheshaheli
offers
you
four
pounds
of
woman
breast
tattoo
marks
and
all
skewered
up
in
a
plantain
leaf
before
breakfast
you
naturally
burn
the
villages
before
lunch
said
stalky
adam
shook
his
head
no
troops
he
sighed
i
told
my
chief
about
it
and
he
said
we
must
wait
till
they
chopped
a
white
man
he
advised
me
if
ever
i
felt
like
it
not
to
commit
a
a
barren
felo
de
se
but
to
let
the
sheshaheli
do
it
then
he
could
report
and
then
we
could
mop
up
most
immoral
that
how
we
got
stalky
quoted
the
name
of
a
province
won
by
just
such
a
sacrifice
yes
but
the
beasts
dominated
one
end
of
my
like
anything
they
chivied
me
out
of
it
when
i
went
to
take
soil
for
analysis
me
and
imam
sahib
is
there
a
need
the
voice
came
out
of
the
darkness
and
the
eyes
shone
over
adam
shoulder
ere
it
ceased
none
the
name
was
taken
in
adam
abolished
him
with
a
turn
of
the
finger
i
could
make
a
casus
belli
of
it
just
then
because
my
chief
had
taken
all
the
troops
to
hammer
a
gang
of
slave
kings
up
north
did
you
ever
hear
of
our
war
against
ibn
makarrah
he
precious
nearly
lost
us
the
protectorate
at
one
time
though
he
an
ally
of
ours
was
he
rather
a
pernicious
brute
even
as
they
go
said
stalky
wade
told
me
about
him
last
well
his
nickname
all
through
the
country
was
merciful
and
he
did
get
that
for
nothing
none
of
our
people
ever
breathed
his
proper
name
they
said
or
one
and
they
did
say
it
aloud
either
he
fought
us
for
eight
i
remember
there
was
a
paragraph
about
it
in
one
of
the
papers
i
said
we
broke
him
though
no
the
slavers
do
come
our
way
because
our
men
have
the
reputation
of
dying
too
much
the
first
month
after
captured
that
knocks
down
profits
you
what
about
your
charming
friends
the
sheshahelis
said
the
infant
there
no
market
for
sheshaheli
people
would
as
soon
buy
crocodiles
i
believe
before
we
annexed
the
country
ibn
makarrah
dropped
down
on
once
to
train
his
young
men
and
simply
hewed
in
pieces
the
bulk
of
my
people
are
agriculturists
just
the
right
stamp
for
what
mother
playing
in
royal
the
organ
that
had
been
crooning
as
happily
as
a
woman
over
her
babe
restored
steadied
to
a
tune
magnificent
oh
magnificent
said
the
infant
loyally
i
had
never
heard
him
sing
but
once
and
then
though
it
was
early
in
the
tolerant
morning
his
mess
had
rolled
him
into
a
lotus
pond
how
did
you
get
your
cannibals
to
work
for
you
asked
strickland
they
got
converted
to
civilization
after
my
chief
smashed
ibn
makarrah
just
at
the
time
i
wanted
you
see
my
chief
had
promised
me
in
writing
that
if
i
could
scrape
up
a
surplus
he
would
not
bag
it
for
his
roads
this
time
but
i
might
have
it
for
my
cotton
game
i
only
needed
two
hundred
pounds
our
revenues
did
run
to
what
is
your
revenue
stalky
asked
in
the
vernacular
with
traders
game
and
mining
licenses
not
more
than
fourteen
thousand
rupees
every
penny
of
it
months
adam
sighed
also
there
is
a
fine
for
dogs
straying
in
the
sahib
camp
last
year
it
exceeded
three
rupees
imam
din
said
quietly
well
i
thought
that
was
fair
they
howled
so
we
were
rather
strict
on
fines
i
worked
up
my
native
clerk
bulaki
ram
to
a
ferocious
pitch
of
enthusiasm
he
used
to
calculate
the
profits
of
our
to
three
points
of
decimals
after
office
i
tell
you
i
envied
your
magistrates
here
hauling
money
out
of
motorists
every
week
i
had
managed
to
make
our
ordinary
revenue
and
expenditure
just
about
meet
and
i
was
crazy
to
get
the
odd
two
hundred
pounds
for
my
cotton
that
sort
of
thing
grows
on
a
chap
when
he
alone
and
talks
aloud
have
you
been
there
already
the
father
said
and
adam
nodded
yes
used
to
spout
what
i
could
remember
of
to
a
tree
sir
well
then
my
luck
turned
one
evening
an
nigger
came
in
towing
a
corpse
by
the
feet
you
get
used
to
little
things
like
that
he
said
he
found
it
and
please
would
i
identify
because
if
it
was
one
of
ibn
makarrah
men
there
might
be
a
reward
it
was
an
old
mohammedan
with
a
strong
dash
of
arab
a
smallboned
chap
and
i
was
just
wondering
how
it
had
kept
so
well
in
our
climate
when
it
sneezed
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
nigger
he
fetched
a
howl
and
bolted
like
like
the
dog
in
sawyer
when
he
sat
on
the
beetle
he
yelped
as
he
ran
and
the
corpse
went
on
sneezing
i
could
see
it
had
been
sarkied
that
a
sort
of
pater
which
attacks
the
nerve
centres
our
chief
medical
officer
is
writing
a
monograph
about
it
so
imam
din
and
i
emptied
out
the
corpse
one
time
with
my
shaving
soap
and
trade
gunpowder
and
hot
water
i
seen
a
case
of
sarkie
before
so
when
the
skin
peeled
off
his
feet
and
he
stopped
sneezing
i
knew
he
live
he
was
bad
though
lay
like
a
log
for
a
week
while
imam
din
and
i
massaged
the
paralysis
out
of
him
then
he
told
us
he
was
a
hajji
had
been
three
times
to
mecca
come
in
from
french
africa
and
that
he
met
the
nigger
by
the
wayside
just
like
a
case
of
thuggee
in
india
and
the
nigger
had
poisoned
him
that
seemed
reasonable
enough
by
what
i
knew
of
coast
you
believed
him
said
his
father
keenly
there
was
no
reason
i
should
the
nigger
never
came
back
and
the
old
man
stayed
with
me
for
two
months
adam
returned
you
know
what
the
best
type
of
a
mohammedan
gentleman
can
be
pater
he
was
none
finer
none
finer
was
the
answer
except
a
sikh
stalky
grunted
he
been
to
bombay
he
knew
french
africa
inside
out
he
could
quote
poetry
and
the
koran
all
day
long
he
played
chess
you
do
know
what
that
meant
to
me
like
a
master
we
used
to
talk
about
the
regeneration
of
turkey
and
the
between
moves
oh
everything
under
the
sun
we
talked
about
he
was
awfully
he
believed
in
slavery
of
course
but
he
quite
saw
that
it
would
have
to
die
out
that
why
he
agreed
with
me
about
developing
the
resources
of
the
district
by
you
you
talked
of
that
too
said
strickland
rather
we
discussed
it
for
hours
you
do
know
what
it
meant
to
me
a
wonderful
man
imam
din
was
not
our
hajji
marvellous
most
marvellous
it
was
all
through
the
hajji
that
we
found
the
money
for
our
imam
din
had
moved
i
fancy
behind
chair
yes
it
must
have
been
dead
against
his
convictions
too
he
brought
me
news
when
i
was
down
with
fever
at
dupe
that
one
of
ibn
makarrah
men
was
parading
through
my
district
with
a
bunch
of
slaves
in
the
fork
what
the
matter
with
the
fork
that
you
ca
abide
it
said
stalky
adam
voice
had
risen
at
the
last
word
local
etiquette
sir
he
replied
too
earnest
to
notice
atrocious
pun
if
a
slaver
runs
slaves
through
british
territory
he
ought
to
pretend
that
they
his
servants
hawkin
about
in
the
fork
the
forked
stick
that
you
put
round
their
necks
you
know
is
insolence
same
as
not
backing
your
topsails
in
the
old
days
besides
it
unsettles
the
i
thought
you
said
slavers
did
come
your
way
i
put
in
they
do
but
my
chief
was
smoking
out
of
the
north
all
that
season
and
they
were
bolting
into
french
territory
any
road
they
could
find
my
orders
were
to
take
no
notice
so
long
as
they
circulated
but
open
in
the
fork
was
too
much
i
could
go
myself
so
i
told
a
couple
of
our
makalali
police
and
imam
din
to
make
talk
with
the
gentleman
one
time
it
was
rather
risky
and
it
might
have
been
expensive
but
it
turned
up
trumps
they
were
back
in
a
few
days
with
the
slaver
he
did
show
fight
and
a
whole
crowd
of
witnesses
and
we
tried
him
in
my
bedroom
and
fined
him
properly
just
to
show
you
how
demoralized
the
brute
must
have
been
arabs
often
go
dotty
after
a
defeat
he
snapped
up
four
or
five
utterly
useless
sheshaheli
and
was
offering
to
all
and
sundry
along
the
road
why
he
offered
to
you
did
he
imam
din
i
was
witness
that
he
offered
for
sale
said
imam
din
luckily
for
my
that
landed
him
both
ways
you
see
he
had
slaved
and
exposed
slaves
for
sale
in
british
territory
that
meant
the
double
fine
if
i
could
get
it
out
of
what
was
his
defence
said
strickland
late
of
the
punjab
police
as
far
as
i
remember
but
i
had
a
temperature
of
degrees
at
the
time
he
mistaken
the
meridians
of
longitude
thought
he
was
in
french
territory
said
he
never
do
it
again
if
we
let
him
off
with
a
fine
i
could
have
shaken
hands
with
the
brute
for
that
he
paid
up
cash
like
a
motorist
and
went
off
one
did
you
see
him
did
i
imam
din
assuredly
the
sahib
both
saw
and
spoke
to
the
slaver
and
the
sahib
also
made
a
speech
to
the
when
he
freed
them
and
they
swore
to
supply
him
with
labour
for
all
his
the
sahib
leaned
on
his
own
servant
shoulder
the
i
remember
something
of
that
i
remember
bulaki
ram
giving
me
the
papers
to
sign
and
i
distinctly
remember
him
locking
up
the
money
in
the
safe
two
hundred
and
ten
beautiful
english
sovereigns
you
know
what
that
meant
to
me
i
believe
it
cured
my
fever
and
as
soon
as
i
could
i
staggered
off
with
the
hajji
to
interview
the
sheshaheli
about
labour
then
i
found
out
why
they
had
been
so
keen
to
work
it
was
gratitude
their
big
village
had
been
hit
by
lightning
and
burned
out
a
week
or
two
before
and
they
lay
flat
in
rows
around
me
asking
me
for
a
job
i
gave
it
and
so
you
were
very
happy
his
mother
had
stolen
up
behind
us
you
liked
your
cotton
dear
she
tidied
the
lump
away
by
jove
i
was
happy
adam
yawned
now
if
any
one
he
looked
at
the
infant
cares
to
put
a
little
money
into
the
scheme
it
be
the
making
of
my
district
i
ca
give
you
figures
sir
but
i
assure
you
take
your
arsenic
and
imam
din
take
you
up
to
bed
and
come
and
tuck
you
agnes
leaned
forward
her
rounded
elbows
on
his
shoulders
hands
joined
across
his
dark
hair
and
is
he
a
darling
she
said
to
us
with
just
the
same
lift
to
the
left
eyebrow
and
the
same
break
of
her
voice
as
sent
strickland
mad
among
the
horses
in
the
year
we
were
quiet
when
they
were
gone
we
waited
till
imam
din
returned
to
us
from
above
and
coughed
at
the
door
as
only
asia
can
now
said
strickland
tell
us
what
truly
befell
son
of
my
all
befell
as
our
sahib
has
said
only
only
there
was
an
arrangement
a
little
arrangement
on
account
of
his
tell
sit
i
beg
your
pardon
infant
said
strickland
but
the
infant
had
already
made
the
sign
and
we
heard
imam
din
hunker
down
on
the
floor
one
gets
little
out
of
the
east
at
attention
when
the
fever
came
on
our
sahib
in
our
roofed
house
at
dupe
he
began
the
hajji
listened
intently
to
his
talk
he
expected
the
names
of
women
though
i
had
already
told
him
that
our
virtue
was
beyond
belief
or
compare
and
that
our
sole
desire
was
this
being
at
last
convinced
the
hajji
breathed
on
our
sahib
forehead
to
sink
into
his
brain
news
concerning
a
in
his
district
who
had
made
a
mock
of
the
law
sahib
imam
din
turned
to
strickland
our
sahib
answered
to
those
false
words
as
a
horse
of
blood
answers
to
the
spur
he
sat
up
he
issued
orders
for
the
apprehension
of
the
slavedealer
then
he
fell
back
then
we
left
alone
servant
of
my
son
and
son
of
my
servant
said
his
father
there
was
an
old
woman
which
belonged
to
the
hajji
she
had
come
in
with
the
hajji
the
hajji
told
her
that
if
our
sahib
died
she
would
die
with
him
and
truly
our
sahib
had
given
me
orders
to
being
mad
with
fever
eh
what
could
we
do
sahib
this
was
his
heart
desire
he
talked
of
it
in
his
fever
therefore
it
was
his
heart
desire
that
the
hajji
went
to
fetch
doubtless
the
hajji
could
have
given
him
money
enough
out
of
hand
for
ten
cottonplays
but
in
this
respect
also
our
sahib
virtue
was
beyond
belief
or
compare
great
ones
do
not
exchange
moneys
therefore
the
hajji
said
and
i
helped
with
my
counsel
that
we
must
make
arrangements
to
get
the
money
in
all
respects
conformable
with
the
english
law
it
was
great
trouble
to
us
but
the
law
is
the
law
and
the
hajji
showed
the
old
woman
the
knife
by
which
she
would
die
if
our
sahib
died
so
i
accompanied
the
knowing
who
he
was
said
strickland
no
fearing
the
man
a
virtue
went
out
from
him
overbearing
the
virtue
of
lesser
persons
the
hajji
told
bulaki
ram
the
clerk
to
occupy
the
seat
of
government
at
dupe
till
our
return
bulaki
ram
feared
the
hajji
because
the
hajji
had
often
gloatingly
appraised
his
skill
in
figures
at
five
thousand
rupees
upon
any
the
hajji
then
said
to
me
and
we
will
make
the
play
the
for
my
delight
delight
the
hajji
loved
our
sahib
with
the
love
of
a
father
for
his
son
of
a
saved
for
his
saviour
of
a
great
one
for
a
great
one
but
i
said
can
not
go
to
that
sheshaheli
place
without
a
hundred
rifles
we
have
here
five
the
hajji
said
have
untied
as
knot
in
my
which
will
be
more
to
us
than
a
thousand
i
saw
that
he
had
so
loosed
it
that
it
lay
flagwise
on
his
shoulder
then
i
knew
that
he
was
a
great
one
with
virtue
in
him
we
came
to
the
highlands
of
the
sheshaheli
on
the
dawn
of
the
second
day
about
the
time
of
the
stirring
of
the
cold
wind
the
hajji
walked
delicately
across
the
open
place
where
their
filth
is
and
scratched
upon
the
gate
which
was
shut
when
it
opened
i
saw
the
lying
on
their
cots
under
the
eaves
of
the
huts
they
rolled
off
they
rose
up
one
behind
the
other
the
length
of
the
street
and
the
fear
on
their
faces
was
as
leaves
whitening
to
a
breeze
the
hajji
stood
in
the
gate
guarding
his
skirts
from
defilement
the
hajji
said
am
here
once
again
give
me
six
and
yoke
up
they
zealously
then
pushed
to
us
with
poles
six
and
yoked
them
with
a
heavy
tree
the
hajji
then
said
fire
from
the
morning
hearth
and
come
to
windward
the
wind
is
strong
on
those
headlands
at
sunrise
so
when
each
had
emptied
his
crock
of
fire
in
front
of
that
which
was
before
him
the
broadside
of
the
town
roared
into
flame
and
all
went
the
hajji
then
said
the
end
of
a
time
there
will
come
here
the
white
man
ye
once
chased
for
sport
he
will
demand
labour
to
plant
such
and
such
stuff
ye
are
that
labour
and
your
spawn
after
you
they
said
lifting
their
heads
a
very
little
from
the
edge
of
the
ashes
are
that
labour
and
our
spawn
after
us
the
hajji
said
is
also
my
name
they
said
name
is
also
the
merciful
the
hajji
said
then
my
mercy
and
while
they
did
this
the
hajji
walked
away
i
the
infant
made
some
noise
in
his
throat
and
reached
for
more
burgundy
about
noon
one
of
our
six
fell
dead
fright
only
frights
sahib
none
had
none
could
touch
him
since
they
were
in
pairs
and
the
other
of
the
fork
was
mad
and
sang
foolishly
we
waited
for
some
heathen
to
do
what
was
needful
there
came
at
last
angari
men
with
goats
the
hajji
said
do
ye
see
they
said
our
lord
we
neither
see
nor
hear
the
hajji
said
i
command
ye
to
see
and
to
hear
and
to
say
they
said
our
lord
it
is
to
our
commanded
eyes
as
though
slaves
stood
in
a
fork
the
hajji
said
testify
before
the
officer
who
waits
you
in
the
town
of
dupe
they
said
shall
come
to
us
after
the
hajji
said
just
reward
for
the
informer
but
if
ye
do
not
testify
then
a
punishment
which
shall
cause
birds
to
fall
from
the
trees
in
terror
and
monkeys
to
scream
for
pity
hearing
this
the
angari
men
hastened
to
dupe
the
hajji
then
said
to
me
those
things
sufficient
to
establish
our
case
or
must
i
drive
in
a
village
full
i
said
that
three
witnesses
amply
established
any
case
but
as
yet
i
said
the
hajji
had
not
offered
his
slaves
for
sale
it
is
true
as
our
sahib
said
just
now
there
is
one
fine
for
catching
slaves
and
yet
another
for
making
to
sell
them
and
it
was
the
double
fine
that
we
needed
sahib
for
our
sahib
we
had
all
this
with
bulaki
ram
who
knows
the
english
law
and
i
thought
the
hajji
remembered
but
he
grew
angry
and
cried
out
god
refuge
of
the
afflicted
must
i
who
am
what
i
am
peddle
this
dog
meat
by
the
roadside
to
gain
his
delight
for
my
heart
delight
none
the
less
he
admitted
it
was
the
english
law
and
so
he
offered
me
the
six
five
in
a
small
voice
with
an
averted
head
the
sheshaheli
do
not
smell
of
sour
milk
as
heathen
should
they
smell
like
leopards
sahib
this
is
because
they
eat
maybe
said
strickland
but
where
were
thy
wits
one
witness
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
the
fact
of
a
what
could
we
do
sahib
there
was
the
hajji
reputation
to
consider
we
could
not
have
called
in
a
heathen
witness
for
such
a
thing
and
moreover
the
sahib
forgets
that
the
defendant
himself
was
making
this
case
he
would
not
contest
his
own
evidence
otherwise
i
know
the
law
of
evidence
well
enough
so
then
we
went
to
dupe
and
while
bulaki
ram
waited
among
the
angari
men
ran
to
see
our
sahib
in
bed
his
eyes
were
very
bright
and
his
mouth
was
full
of
orders
but
the
old
woman
had
not
loosened
her
hair
for
death
the
hajji
said
quick
with
my
trial
i
am
not
job
the
hajji
was
a
learned
man
we
made
the
trial
swiftly
to
a
sound
of
soothing
voices
round
the
bed
yet
yet
because
no
man
can
be
sure
whether
a
sahib
of
that
blood
sees
or
does
not
see
we
made
it
strictly
in
the
manner
of
the
forms
of
the
english
law
only
the
witnesses
and
the
slaves
and
the
prisoner
we
kept
without
for
his
nose
then
he
did
not
see
the
prisoner
said
strickland
i
stood
by
to
shackle
up
an
angari
in
case
he
should
demand
it
but
by
god
favour
he
was
too
far
fevered
to
ask
for
one
it
is
quite
true
he
signed
the
papers
it
is
quite
true
he
saw
the
money
put
away
in
the
safe
two
hundred
and
ten
english
pounds
and
it
is
quite
true
that
the
gold
wrought
on
him
as
a
strong
cure
but
as
to
his
seeing
the
prisoner
and
having
speech
with
the
the
hajji
breathed
all
that
on
his
forehead
to
sink
into
his
sick
brain
a
little
as
ye
have
heard
has
remained
ah
but
when
the
fever
broke
and
our
sahib
called
for
the
and
the
thin
little
from
europe
with
the
pictures
of
ploughs
and
hoes
and
ah
then
he
laughed
as
he
used
to
laugh
sahib
it
was
his
heart
desire
this
the
hajji
loved
him
as
who
does
not
it
was
a
little
little
arrangement
sahib
of
which
is
it
necessary
to
tell
all
the
world
and
when
didst
thou
know
who
the
hajji
was
said
strickland
not
for
a
certainty
till
he
and
our
sahib
had
returned
from
their
visit
to
the
sheshaheli
country
it
is
quite
true
as
our
sahib
says
the
lay
flat
around
his
feet
and
asked
for
spades
to
cultivate
cotton
that
very
night
when
i
was
cooking
the
dinner
the
hajji
said
to
me
go
to
my
own
place
though
god
knows
whether
the
man
with
the
stone
eyes
have
left
me
an
ox
a
slave
or
a
woman
i
said
art
then
that
one
the
hajji
said
am
ten
thousand
rupees
reward
into
thy
hand
shall
we
make
another
and
get
more
cotton
machines
for
the
boy
i
said
dog
am
i
to
do
this
may
god
prolong
thy
life
a
thousand
years
the
hajji
said
has
seen
god
has
given
me
as
it
were
a
son
in
my
old
age
and
i
praise
him
see
that
the
breed
is
not
lost
he
walked
then
from
the
to
our
sahib
under
the
tree
where
our
sahib
held
in
his
hand
a
blue
envelope
of
service
newly
come
in
by
runner
from
the
north
at
this
fearing
evil
news
for
the
hajji
i
would
have
restrained
him
but
he
said
be
both
great
ones
neither
of
us
will
fail
our
sahib
looked
up
to
invite
the
hajji
to
approach
before
he
opened
the
letter
but
the
hajji
stood
off
till
our
sahib
had
well
opened
and
well
read
the
letter
then
the
hajji
said
it
permitted
to
say
farewell
our
sahib
stabbed
the
letter
on
the
file
with
a
deep
and
joyful
breath
and
cried
a
welcome
the
hajji
said
go
to
my
own
place
and
he
loosed
from
his
neck
a
chained
heart
of
ambergris
set
in
soft
gold
and
held
it
forth
our
sahib
snatched
it
swiftly
in
the
closed
fist
down
turned
and
said
thy
name
be
written
hereon
it
is
needless
for
a
name
is
already
engraved
on
my
heart
the
hajji
said
on
mine
also
is
a
name
engraved
but
there
is
no
name
on
the
amulet
the
hajji
stooped
to
our
sahib
feet
but
our
sahib
raised
and
embraced
him
and
the
hajji
covered
his
mouth
with
his
because
it
worked
and
so
he
went
and
what
order
was
in
the
service
letter
stalky
murmured
only
an
order
for
our
sahib
to
write
a
report
on
some
new
cattle
sickness
but
all
orders
come
in
the
same
make
of
envelope
we
could
not
tell
what
order
it
might
have
when
he
opened
the
letter
my
son
made
he
no
sign
a
cough
an
oath
strickland
asked
none
sahib
i
watched
his
hands
they
did
not
shake
afterward
he
wiped
his
face
but
he
was
sweating
before
from
the
did
he
know
did
he
know
who
the
hajji
was
said
the
infant
in
english
i
am
a
poor
man
who
can
say
what
a
sahib
of
that
get
knows
or
does
not
know
but
the
hajji
is
right
the
breed
should
not
be
lost
it
is
not
very
hot
for
little
children
in
dupe
and
as
regards
nurses
my
cousin
at
jull
h
that
is
the
boy
own
concern
i
wonder
if
his
chief
ever
knew
said
strickland
assuredly
said
imam
din
on
the
night
before
our
sahib
went
down
to
the
sea
the
great
sahib
the
man
with
the
stone
eyes
dined
with
him
in
his
camp
i
being
in
charge
of
the
table
they
talked
a
long
while
and
the
great
sahib
said
didst
thou
think
of
that
one
we
do
not
say
ibn
makarrah
yonder
our
sahib
said
one
the
great
sahib
said
one
which
taught
thy
to
grow
cotton
for
thee
he
was
in
thy
district
three
months
to
my
certain
knowledge
and
i
looked
by
every
runner
that
thou
wouldst
send
me
in
his
head
our
sahib
said
his
head
had
been
needed
another
man
should
have
been
appointed
to
govern
my
district
for
he
was
my
friend
the
great
sahib
laughed
and
said
i
had
needed
a
lesser
man
in
thy
place
be
sure
i
would
have
sent
him
as
if
i
had
needed
the
head
of
that
one
be
sure
i
would
have
sent
men
to
bring
it
to
me
but
tell
me
now
by
what
means
didst
thou
twist
him
to
thy
use
and
our
profit
in
this
our
sahib
said
god
i
did
not
use
that
man
in
any
fashion
whatever
he
was
my
friend
the
great
sahib
said
vac
bosh
tell
our
sahib
shook
his
head
as
he
does
as
he
did
when
a
child
and
they
looked
at
each
other
like
men
in
the
ring
at
a
fair
the
great
sahib
dropped
his
eyes
first
and
he
said
be
it
i
should
perhaps
have
answered
thus
in
my
youth
no
matter
i
have
made
treaty
with
that
one
as
an
ally
of
the
state
some
day
he
shall
tell
me
the
tale
then
i
brought
in
fresh
coffee
and
they
ceased
but
i
do
not
think
that
one
will
tell
the
great
sahib
more
than
our
sahib
told
wherefore
i
asked
because
they
are
both
great
ones
and
i
have
observed
in
my
life
that
great
ones
employ
words
very
little
between
each
other
in
their
dealings
still
less
when
they
speak
to
a
third
concerning
those
dealings
also
they
profit
by
silence
now
i
think
that
the
mother
has
come
down
from
the
room
and
i
will
go
rub
his
feet
till
he
his
ears
had
caught
agnes
step
at
the
and
presently
she
passed
us
on
her
way
to
the
music
room
humming
the
magnificat
the
new
knighthood
who
gives
him
the
bath
i
said
the
wet
rank
i
give
him
the
bath
who
sing
the
psalms
we
said
the
palms
ere
the
hot
wind
becalms
we
sing
the
who
lays
on
the
sword
i
said
the
sun
before
he
has
done
i
lay
on
the
who
fastens
his
belt
i
said
i
know
all
the
fashions
of
tightening
a
belt
who
buckles
his
spur
i
said
his
chief
exacting
and
brief
i
give
him
the
who
shake
his
hand
i
said
the
fever
and
i
no
deceiver
i
shake
his
who
brings
him
the
wine
i
said
quinine
it
a
habit
of
mine
i
come
with
his
who
put
him
to
proof
i
said
all
earth
whatever
he
worth
i
put
to
the
who
choose
him
for
knight
i
said
his
mother
before
any
other
my
very
own
knight
and
after
this
fashion
adventure
to
seek
was
sir
galahad
made
as
it
might
be
last
week
the
puzzler
i
had
not
seen
penfentenyou
since
the
middle
nineties
when
he
was
minister
of
ways
and
woodsides
in
de
thouar
first
administration
last
summer
though
he
nominally
held
the
same
portfolio
he
was
his
premier
in
all
but
name
and
the
idol
of
his
own
province
which
is
two
and
a
half
times
the
size
of
england
politically
his
creed
was
his
growing
country
and
he
came
over
to
england
to
develop
a
great
idea
in
her
behalf
believing
that
he
had
put
it
in
train
i
made
haste
to
welcome
him
to
my
house
for
a
week
that
he
was
chased
to
my
door
by
his
own
in
a
motor
that
they
turned
my
study
into
a
cabinet
meeting
which
i
was
not
invited
to
attend
that
the
local
telegraph
all
but
broke
down
beneath
the
strain
of
hundred
word
coded
cables
and
that
i
practically
broke
into
the
house
of
a
stranger
to
get
him
telephonic
facilities
on
a
sunday
are
things
i
overlook
what
i
objected
to
was
his
ingratitude
while
i
thus
tore
up
england
to
help
him
so
i
said
why
on
earth
did
you
see
your
opposite
number
in
town
instead
of
bringing
your
office
work
here
eh
who
said
he
looking
up
from
his
fourth
cable
since
lunch
see
the
english
minister
for
ways
and
i
saw
him
said
penfentenyou
without
enthusiasm
it
seemed
that
he
had
called
twice
on
the
gentleman
but
without
an
appointment
i
thought
if
i
was
big
enough
my
business
was
and
each
time
had
found
him
engaged
a
third
party
intervening
suggested
that
a
meeting
might
be
arranged
if
due
notice
were
given
then
said
penfentenyou
i
called
at
the
office
at
ten
but
they
be
in
bed
i
cried
one
of
the
babies
was
awake
he
told
me
that
that
sort
of
questions
he
slapped
the
pile
of
cables
were
only
taken
between
and
so
i
and
when
you
got
to
business
i
asked
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
it
was
like
talking
to
children
never
heard
of
and
your
opposite
number
penfentenyou
described
him
hush
you
must
talk
like
that
i
shuddered
he
one
of
the
best
of
good
fellows
you
should
meet
him
i
done
that
too
he
said
have
you
heaven
forbid
i
cried
but
that
the
proper
thing
to
oh
he
said
all
the
proper
things
only
i
thought
as
this
was
england
that
they
more
or
less
have
the
hang
of
all
the
general
of
my
idea
but
i
had
to
explain
it
from
the
ah
they
probably
mislaid
the
papers
i
said
and
i
told
him
the
story
of
a
pound
insurrection
caused
by
a
deputy
sitting
upon
a
mass
of
correspondence
instead
of
reading
it
i
wonder
it
does
happen
every
week
the
answered
mind
my
having
the
to
dinner
again
tonight
i
wire
and
he
can
motor
the
arrived
two
hours
later
a
patient
and
expostulating
person
visibly
torn
between
the
pulling
devil
of
a
rampant
colony
and
the
placid
baker
of
a
largely
uninterested
england
but
with
penfentenyou
behind
him
he
had
worked
for
he
told
us
that
lord
lundie
the
law
lord
was
the
final
authority
on
the
legal
and
constitutional
aspects
of
the
great
idea
and
to
him
it
must
be
referred
good
heavens
alive
thundered
penfentenyou
i
told
you
to
get
that
settled
last
it
was
the
middle
of
the
season
said
the
mildly
lord
lundie
at
credence
green
now
he
spends
his
holidays
there
it
only
forty
miles
sha
i
disturb
his
holiness
said
penfentenyou
heavily
perhaps
sort
of
questions
he
snorted
may
be
discussed
except
at
oh
do
be
a
child
i
said
what
this
country
needs
said
penfentenyou
is
and
for
ten
minutes
he
trumpeted
rebellion
what
you
need
is
to
pay
for
your
own
protection
i
cut
in
when
he
drew
breath
and
i
showed
him
a
yellowish
paper
supplied
gratis
by
government
which
is
called
schedule
to
my
merciless
delight
he
had
never
seen
the
thing
before
and
i
completed
my
victory
over
him
and
all
the
colonies
with
a
brassey
naval
annual
and
a
statesman
year
the
interposed
with
but
they
were
merely
provocateurs
about
ties
of
sentiment
they
be
blowed
said
penfentenyou
what
the
good
of
sentiment
towards
a
kindergarten
quite
so
ties
of
common
funk
are
the
things
that
bind
us
together
and
the
sooner
you
new
nations
realize
it
the
better
what
you
need
is
an
annual
invasion
then
you
grow
thank
you
thank
you
said
the
that
what
i
am
always
trying
to
tell
my
but
my
dear
fool
penfentenyou
almost
wept
do
you
pretend
that
these
amateurs
at
home
are
grown
up
you
poor
serious
pagan
man
i
retorted
if
you
take
that
way
you
wreck
your
great
will
you
take
him
to
lord
lundie
said
the
promptly
i
suppose
i
must
i
said
if
you
not
me
i
going
home
said
the
and
departed
i
am
glad
that
i
am
no
colony
penfentenyou
continued
to
argue
about
naval
contributions
till
though
i
was
victor
from
the
first
at
ten
i
got
him
and
his
correspondence
into
the
motor
and
he
had
the
decency
to
ask
whether
he
had
been
unpolished
i
replied
that
i
waited
an
apology
this
he
made
excuse
for
renewed
arguments
and
used
wayside
shows
as
illustrations
of
the
decadence
of
england
for
example
we
burst
a
tyre
within
a
mile
of
credence
green
and
to
save
time
walked
into
the
beautifully
kept
little
village
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
building
of
tin
stencilled
calvinist
chapel
before
whose
shuttered
windows
an
italian
with
a
petticoated
monkey
was
playing
dolly
yes
that
it
snapped
the
egoist
that
a
parable
of
the
general
situation
in
england
and
look
at
those
brutes
a
huge
household
removals
van
was
halted
at
a
the
men
in
charge
were
drinking
beer
from
blue
and
white
mugs
it
seemed
to
me
a
pretty
sight
but
penfentenyou
said
it
represented
our
national
attitude
lord
lundie
summer
we
learned
was
a
farm
a
little
out
of
the
village
up
a
hill
round
which
curled
a
high
hedged
road
only
an
initiated
few
spend
their
holidays
at
credence
green
and
they
have
trained
the
householders
to
keep
the
place
select
penfentenyou
made
a
grievance
of
this
as
we
walked
up
the
lane
followed
at
a
distance
by
the
suppose
he
is
having
a
he
said
anything
possible
in
this
insane
just
at
that
minute
we
found
ourselves
opposite
an
empty
villa
its
roof
was
of
black
slate
with
bright
unweathered
its
walls
were
of
brick
cornered
and
banded
with
vermiculated
stucco
work
and
there
was
cobalt
magenta
and
purest
on
either
side
of
the
front
door
the
whole
was
fenced
from
the
road
by
a
low
flint
wall
topped
with
a
gothic
rail
picked
out
in
blue
and
gold
tight
beds
of
geranium
calceolaria
and
lobelia
speckled
the
from
whose
centre
rose
one
of
the
finest
araucarias
its
other
name
by
the
way
is
that
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
see
it
must
have
been
full
thirty
feet
high
and
its
foliage
exquisitely
answered
the
iron
railings
such
bijou
ne
plus
ultras
replete
with
all
the
amenities
do
not
as
i
pointed
out
to
penfentenyou
transpire
outside
of
england
a
hedge
swinging
sharp
right
flanked
the
garden
and
above
it
on
a
slope
of
meadows
we
could
see
lord
lundie
tiled
and
summer
farmhouse
of
a
sudden
we
heard
voices
behind
the
tree
the
fine
full
tones
of
the
unembarrassed
english
speaking
to
their
equals
that
tore
through
the
hedge
like
sleet
through
rafters
that
it
is
not
called
for
nothing
i
willingly
concede
this
was
a
rich
and
rolling
note
but
on
the
other
hand
i
submit
me
lud
that
the
name
implies
that
it
might
could
would
or
should
be
ascended
by
a
monkey
and
not
that
the
ascent
is
a
physical
impossibility
i
believe
one
of
our
south
american
spider
monkeys
would
hesitate
by
jove
it
might
be
worth
trying
if
this
was
a
crisper
voice
than
the
first
a
third
and
full
of
pleasant
affectations
broke
in
oh
practical
men
there
is
no
ape
here
why
do
you
waste
one
of
own
days
on
unprofitable
discussion
give
me
a
match
i
a
good
mind
to
make
you
demonstrate
in
your
own
person
come
on
bubbles
we
make
jimmy
climb
there
was
a
sound
of
scuffling
broken
by
squeaks
from
jimmy
of
the
high
voice
i
turned
back
and
drew
penfentenyou
into
the
side
of
the
flanking
hedge
i
remembered
to
have
read
in
a
society
paper
that
lord
lesser
name
was
what
are
they
doing
penfentenyou
said
sharply
drunk
just
playing
superabundant
vitality
of
the
race
you
know
we
watch
i
answered
the
noise
ceased
my
deliver
jimmy
gasped
the
ram
caught
in
the
thicket
and
i
the
only
one
who
can
talk
neapolitan
leggo
my
collar
he
cried
aloud
in
a
foreign
tongue
and
was
answered
from
the
gate
it
the
calvinistic
i
whispered
i
had
already
found
a
practicable
break
at
the
bottom
of
the
hedge
they
going
to
try
to
make
the
monkey
climb
i
here
let
me
look
penfentenyou
flung
himself
down
and
rooted
till
he
too
broke
a
we
lay
side
by
side
commanding
the
entire
garden
at
ten
yards
range
you
know
said
penfentenyou
as
i
made
some
noise
or
other
by
sight
only
the
big
fellow
in
flannels
is
lord
lundie
the
one
with
the
yellow
beard
painted
his
picture
at
the
last
academy
he
a
swell
james
and
the
brown
chap
with
the
hands
tomling
sir
christopher
tomling
the
south
american
engineer
who
built
the
san
juan
viaduct
i
know
said
penfentenyou
we
ought
to
have
had
him
with
us
do
you
think
a
monkey
would
climb
the
tree
the
at
the
gate
fenced
his
beast
with
one
arm
as
do
show
off
your
futile
accomplishments
said
lord
lundie
tell
him
it
an
experiment
interest
him
shut
up
bubbles
you
are
in
court
jimmy
replied
this
needs
delicacy
giuseppe
says
interest
the
monkey
the
brown
engineer
interrupted
he
wo
climb
for
love
cut
up
to
the
house
and
get
some
biscuits
bubbles
sugar
ones
and
an
orange
or
two
no
need
to
tell
our
the
huge
white
figure
lobbed
off
at
a
trot
which
would
not
have
disgraced
a
boy
of
seventeen
i
gathered
from
something
jimmy
let
fall
that
the
three
had
been
at
harrow
together
that
tomling
has
a
head
on
his
shoulders
muttered
penfentenyou
pity
we
did
get
him
for
the
colony
but
the
question
is
will
the
monkey
climb
be
quick
jimmy
tell
the
man
we
give
him
five
bob
for
the
loan
of
the
beast
now
run
the
organ
under
the
tree
and
we
dress
it
when
bubbles
comes
back
sir
christopher
cried
i
often
wondered
said
penfentenyou
whether
it
would
puzzle
a
monkey
he
had
forgotten
the
needs
of
his
growing
nation
and
was
earnestly
parting
the
stems
with
his
fingers
giuseppe
and
jimmy
did
as
they
were
told
the
monkey
following
them
with
a
wary
and
malignant
eye
here
a
discovery
said
jimmy
the
singing
part
of
this
organ
comes
off
the
he
spoke
volubly
to
the
proprietor
oh
it
so
as
giuseppe
can
take
it
to
his
room
o
nights
and
play
it
hear
that
the
after
his
day
crime
plays
his
accursed
machine
for
love
for
love
chris
and
michael
angelo
was
one
of
do
jaw
tell
him
to
take
the
beast
petticoat
off
said
sir
christopher
tomling
lord
lundie
returned
very
little
winded
through
a
gap
higher
up
the
hedge
they
all
out
thank
goodness
he
cried
but
i
raided
what
i
could
marrons
glaces
candied
fruit
and
a
bag
of
excellent
said
the
contractor
jimmy
you
the
jump
up
on
the
organ
and
impale
these
things
on
the
leaves
as
i
hand
i
see
said
jimmy
capering
like
a
springbuck
upward
and
onward
eh
first
he
reach
out
for
how
infernal
prickly
these
leaves
are
this
biscuit
next
we
lure
him
on
that
about
the
reach
of
his
arm
with
the
marron
glace
and
then
he
open
out
this
orange
how
human
how
like
your
ignoble
career
bubbles
with
care
and
elaboration
they
ornamented
that
tree
lower
branches
with
biscuits
oranges
bits
of
banana
and
marrons
glaces
till
it
looked
very
ape
path
to
paradise
unchain
the
gyascutis
said
sir
christopher
commandingly
giuseppe
placed
the
monkey
atop
of
the
organ
where
the
beast
misunderstanding
stood
on
his
head
he
throwing
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
court
me
lud
said
jimmy
no
now
he
interested
now
he
reaching
after
higher
things
what
would
i
give
to
have
here
he
mentioned
a
name
not
unhonoured
in
british
art
ambition
plucking
apples
of
sodom
the
monkey
had
pricked
himself
and
was
swearing
genius
hampered
by
convention
oh
there
a
whole
bushelful
of
allegories
in
it
give
him
time
he
balancing
the
probabilities
said
lord
lundie
the
three
closed
round
the
monkey
hanging
on
his
every
motion
with
an
earnestness
almost
equal
to
ours
the
great
judge
head
seamed
and
vertical
forehead
iron
mouth
and
all
set
on
that
thick
neck
rising
out
of
the
white
flannelled
collar
was
thrown
against
the
puckered
green
silk
of
the
as
it
might
have
been
a
cameo
of
titus
jimmy
with
raised
eyes
and
parted
lips
fingered
his
grizzled
chestnut
beard
and
i
was
near
enough
the
capable
beauty
of
his
hands
sir
christopher
stood
a
little
apart
his
arms
folded
behind
his
back
one
heavy
brown
boot
thrust
forward
chin
in
as
curbed
and
black
eyebrows
lowered
to
shade
the
keen
eyes
giuseppe
dark
face
between
flashing
earrings
a
twisted
rag
of
red
and
yellow
silk
round
his
throat
turned
from
the
reaching
yearning
monkey
to
the
pink
and
white
biscuits
spiked
on
the
bronzed
leafage
and
upon
them
all
fell
the
serious
and
workmanlike
sun
of
an
english
summer
forenoon
fils
de
saint
louis
montez
au
ciel
said
lord
lundie
suddenly
in
a
voice
that
made
me
think
of
black
caps
i
do
not
know
what
the
monkey
thought
because
at
that
instant
he
leaped
off
the
organ
and
disappeared
there
was
a
clash
of
broken
glass
behind
the
tree
the
monkey
face
distorted
with
passion
appeared
at
an
upper
window
of
the
house
and
a
starred
hole
in
the
window
to
the
left
of
front
door
showed
the
first
steps
of
his
upward
path
we
got
to
catch
him
cried
sir
christopher
come
along
they
pushed
at
the
door
which
was
unlocked
yes
but
consider
the
ethics
of
the
case
said
jimmy
is
this
burglary
or
something
bubbles
settle
that
when
he
caught
said
sir
christopher
we
responsible
for
the
a
furious
clanging
of
bells
broke
out
of
the
empty
house
followed
by
muffed
gurglings
and
trumpetings
what
the
deuce
is
that
i
asked
half
aloud
the
plumbing
of
course
said
penfentenyou
what
a
pity
i
believe
he
have
climbed
if
lord
lundie
had
put
him
off
wait
a
moment
chris
said
jimmy
the
interpreter
guiseppe
says
he
may
answer
to
the
music
of
his
infancy
giuseppe
therefore
will
go
in
with
the
organ
orpheus
with
his
lute
you
know
avante
orpheus
there
no
neapolitan
for
bathroom
but
i
fancy
your
friend
is
i
not
going
into
another
man
house
with
a
said
lord
lundie
recoiling
as
giuseppe
unshipped
the
working
mechanism
of
the
organ
it
developed
a
leg
from
its
wheels
slipped
a
strap
round
his
shoulders
and
gave
the
handle
a
twist
do
be
a
cad
bubbles
was
jimmy
answer
you
could
leave
us
now
if
you
were
on
the
woolsack
play
orpheus
the
cadi
with
a
whoop
a
buzz
and
a
crash
the
organ
sprang
to
life
under
the
hand
of
giuseppe
and
the
procession
passed
through
the
front
door
a
moment
later
we
saw
the
monkey
ramping
on
the
roof
he
be
all
over
the
township
in
a
minute
if
we
do
head
him
said
penfentenyou
leaping
to
his
feet
and
crashing
into
the
garden
we
headed
him
with
pebbles
till
he
retired
through
a
window
to
the
tuneful
reminder
that
he
had
left
a
lot
of
little
things
behind
him
as
we
passed
the
front
door
it
swung
open
and
showed
jimmy
the
artist
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
a
staircase
he
waggled
his
hands
at
us
and
when
we
entered
we
saw
that
the
man
was
stricken
speechless
his
eyes
grew
red
red
like
a
ferret
and
what
little
breath
he
had
whistled
shrilly
at
first
we
thought
it
was
a
fit
and
then
we
saw
that
it
was
mirth
the
inopportune
mirth
of
the
artistic
temperament
the
house
palpitated
to
an
infamous
melody
punctuated
by
the
stump
of
the
one
leg
as
giuseppe
above
moved
from
room
to
room
after
his
rebel
slave
now
and
again
a
floor
shook
a
little
under
the
combined
rushes
of
lord
lundie
and
sir
christopher
tomling
who
gave
many
and
contradictory
orders
but
when
they
could
they
cursed
jimmy
with
splendid
thoroughness
have
you
anything
to
do
with
the
house
panted
jimmy
at
last
because
we
using
it
just
he
gulped
and
i
ah
keeping
all
right
said
penfentenyou
and
shut
the
hall
door
jimmy
you
unspeakable
blackguard
jimmy
you
cur
you
coward
lord
lundie
voice
overbore
the
flood
of
melody
come
up
here
giussieppe
saying
something
we
do
jimmy
listened
and
interpreted
between
hiccups
he
says
you
better
play
the
organ
bubbles
and
let
him
do
the
stalking
the
monkey
knows
by
jove
he
quite
right
said
sir
christopher
from
the
landing
take
it
bubbles
at
my
god
said
lord
lundie
in
horror
the
chase
reverberated
over
our
heads
from
the
attics
to
the
first
floor
and
back
again
bodies
and
voices
met
in
collision
and
argument
and
once
or
twice
the
organ
hit
walls
and
doors
then
it
broke
forth
in
a
new
manner
he
playing
it
said
jimmy
i
know
his
acute
justinian
ear
are
you
fond
of
music
i
think
lord
lundie
plays
very
well
for
a
beginner
i
ventured
ah
that
the
trained
legal
intellect
like
mastering
a
brief
i
have
got
he
wiped
his
eyes
and
shook
hi
said
penfentenyou
looking
through
the
stained
glass
window
down
the
garden
what
that
a
household
removals
van
in
charge
of
four
men
had
halted
at
the
gate
a
husband
and
his
wife
householders
beyond
question
quavered
irresolutely
up
the
path
he
looked
tired
she
was
certainly
cross
in
all
this
haphazard
world
the
last
couple
to
understand
a
scientific
experiment
i
laid
hands
on
jimmy
the
clamour
above
drowning
speech
and
with
penfentenyou
aid
propped
him
against
the
window
that
he
should
see
he
saw
nodded
fell
as
an
umbrella
can
fall
and
kneeling
beat
his
forehead
on
the
shut
door
penfentenyou
slid
the
bolt
the
furniture
men
reinforced
the
two
figures
on
the
path
and
advanced
spreading
generously
had
we
better
warn
them
i
suggested
no
i
die
first
said
jimmy
i
pretty
near
it
now
besides
they
called
me
i
turned
from
the
artist
to
the
administrator
ceteris
paribus
i
think
we
better
be
going
said
penfentenyou
dealer
in
crises
ta
take
me
with
you
said
jimmy
i
no
reputation
to
lose
but
like
to
watch
from
er
outside
the
there
always
a
modus
vivendi
penfentenyou
murmured
and
tiptoed
along
the
hall
to
a
back
door
which
he
opened
quite
silently
we
passed
into
a
tangle
of
gooseberry
bushes
where
at
his
statesmanlike
example
we
crawled
on
all
fours
and
regained
the
hedge
here
we
lay
up
secure
in
our
alibi
but
your
firm
the
woman
was
wailing
to
the
furniture
removals
men
your
firm
promised
me
everything
should
be
in
yesterday
and
you
should
have
been
here
yesterday
the
last
tenants
ai
out
yet
lydy
said
one
of
them
lord
lundie
was
rapidly
improving
in
technique
though
unlike
the
law
is
more
of
a
calling
than
a
trade
and
he
hung
occasionally
on
a
dead
centre
giuseppe
i
think
was
singing
but
i
could
not
understand
the
drift
of
sir
christopher
remarks
they
were
spanish
the
woman
said
something
we
did
not
catch
you
might
it
the
man
insisted
or
your
gentleman
but
i
did
send
for
the
police
at
i
would
do
that
lydy
they
only
fruit
pickers
on
a
beano
they
are
particular
where
they
mean
they
been
sleeping
there
i
only
had
it
cleaned
last
week
get
them
oh
if
you
say
so
we
out
of
it
in
two
twos
alf
fetch
me
the
spare
do
you
knock
the
paint
off
the
door
get
them
out
what
the
else
am
i
trying
to
do
for
you
lydy
the
man
answered
with
pathos
but
the
woman
wheeled
on
her
mate
edward
they
all
drunk
here
and
they
all
mad
there
do
something
she
said
edward
took
one
short
step
forward
and
sighed
hullo
in
the
direction
of
the
turbulent
house
the
woman
walked
up
and
down
the
very
figure
of
domestic
tragedy
the
furniture
men
swayed
a
little
on
their
heels
and
got
him
the
shout
rang
through
all
the
windows
at
once
it
was
followed
by
a
bay
from
sir
christopher
a
maniacal
prestissimo
on
the
organ
and
loud
cries
for
jimmy
but
jimmy
at
my
side
rolled
his
congested
eyeballs
i
never
knew
them
he
said
i
an
the
front
door
opened
and
the
three
came
forth
to
triumph
i
had
never
before
seen
a
law
lord
dressed
as
for
tennis
with
a
strapped
to
his
shoulder
but
it
is
a
shy
bird
in
this
plumage
lord
lundie
strove
to
disembarrass
himself
of
his
accoutrements
much
as
an
punch
and
judy
dog
tries
to
escape
backwards
through
his
frilled
collar
sir
christopher
covered
with
limewash
cherished
a
bleeding
thumb
and
the
almost
crazy
monkey
tore
at
giuseppe
hair
the
men
on
both
sides
reeled
but
the
woman
stood
her
ground
idiots
she
said
and
once
more
idiots
i
could
have
gladdened
a
few
convicts
of
my
acquaintance
with
a
photograph
of
lord
lundie
at
that
instant
madam
he
began
wonderfully
preserving
the
roll
in
his
voice
it
was
a
sir
christopher
sucked
his
thumb
and
nodded
take
it
away
and
go
she
replied
go
away
i
would
have
gone
and
gladly
on
this
permission
but
these
still
strong
men
must
ever
be
justifying
themselves
lord
lundie
turned
to
the
husband
who
for
the
first
time
spoke
i
have
rented
this
house
i
am
moving
in
he
said
we
ought
to
have
been
in
yesterday
the
woman
interrupted
yes
we
ought
to
have
been
in
yesterday
have
you
slept
there
overnight
said
the
man
peevishly
no
i
assure
you
we
have
said
lord
lundie
then
go
away
go
quite
away
cried
the
woman
they
went
in
single
file
down
the
path
they
went
silently
restrapping
the
organ
on
its
wheels
and
rechaining
the
monkey
to
the
organ
damn
it
all
said
penfentenyou
they
do
face
the
music
and
they
do
stick
by
each
other
in
private
life
ties
of
common
funk
i
answered
giuseppe
ran
to
the
gate
and
fled
back
to
the
possible
world
lord
lundie
and
sir
christopher
constrained
by
tradition
paced
slowly
then
it
came
to
pass
that
the
woman
who
walked
behind
them
lifted
up
her
eyes
and
beheld
the
tree
which
they
had
dressed
stop
she
called
and
they
stopped
who
did
that
there
was
no
answer
the
eternal
bad
boy
in
every
man
hung
its
head
before
the
eternal
mother
in
every
woman
who
put
these
disgusting
things
there
she
repeated
suddenly
penfentenyou
premier
of
his
colony
in
all
but
name
left
jimmy
and
me
and
appeared
at
the
gate
if
he
is
not
turned
out
of
office
that
is
how
he
will
appear
on
the
day
of
armageddon
well
done
you
he
cried
zealously
and
doffed
his
hat
to
the
woman
have
you
any
children
madam
he
demanded
yes
two
they
should
have
been
here
the
firm
promised
then
we
not
a
minute
too
soon
that
monkey
escaped
it
was
a
very
dangerous
beast
have
frightened
your
children
into
fits
all
the
fault
a
most
lucky
thing
these
gentlemen
caught
it
when
they
did
i
hope
you
are
badly
mauled
sir
christopher
shaken
as
i
was
i
wanted
to
get
away
and
laugh
i
could
not
but
admire
the
scoundrel
consummate
tact
in
leading
his
second
highest
trump
an
ass
would
have
introduced
lord
lundie
and
they
would
not
have
believed
him
it
took
the
trick
the
couple
smiled
and
gave
respectful
thanks
for
their
deliverance
by
such
hands
from
such
perils
not
in
the
least
said
lord
lundie
anybody
any
father
would
have
done
as
much
and
pray
do
apologize
your
mistake
was
quite
a
furniture
man
sniggered
here
and
lord
lundie
rolled
an
eye
of
doom
on
their
ranks
by
the
way
if
you
have
trouble
with
these
persons
they
seem
to
have
taken
as
much
as
is
good
for
them
please
let
me
know
er
good
morning
they
turned
into
the
lane
heavens
said
jimmy
brushing
himself
down
who
that
real
man
with
the
real
head
and
we
hurried
after
them
for
they
were
running
unsteadily
squeaking
like
rabbits
as
they
ran
we
overtook
them
in
a
little
nut
wood
half
a
mile
up
the
road
where
they
had
turned
aside
and
were
rolling
so
we
rolled
with
them
and
ceased
not
till
we
had
arrived
at
the
extremity
of
exhaustion
you
you
saw
it
all
then
said
lord
lundie
rebuttoning
his
collar
i
saw
it
was
a
vital
question
from
the
first
responded
penfentenyou
and
blew
his
nose
it
was
by
the
way
mind
telling
me
your
name
summa
penfentenyou
great
idea
has
gone
through
a
little
chipped
at
the
edges
but
in
fine
and
shape
his
opposite
number
worked
at
it
like
a
mule
a
bewildered
mule
beaten
from
behind
coaxed
from
in
front
and
propped
on
either
soft
side
by
lord
lundie
of
the
compressed
mouth
and
the
searing
tongue
sir
christopher
tomling
has
been
ravished
from
the
argentine
where
after
all
he
was
but
preparing
for
hostile
peoples
and
now
adorns
the
forefront
of
penfentenyou
advisory
board
this
was
an
unforeseen
extra
as
was
jimmy
gratis
it
will
be
in
this
year
academy
of
penfentenyou
who
has
returned
to
his
own
place
now
and
again
from
afar
off
between
the
slam
and
bump
of
his
shifting
scenery
the
glare
of
his
manipulated
limelight
and
the
controlled
rolling
of
his
i
catch
his
voice
lifted
in
encouragement
and
advice
to
his
he
is
quite
sound
on
ties
of
sentiment
and
alone
of
colonial
statesmen
ventures
to
talk
of
the
ties
of
common
funk
herein
i
have
my
reward
the
puzzler
the
celt
in
all
his
variants
from
builth
to
ballyhoo
his
mental
processes
are
plain
one
knows
what
he
will
do
and
can
logically
predicate
his
finish
by
his
start
but
the
english
ah
the
english
they
are
quite
a
race
apart
their
psychology
is
bovine
their
outlook
crude
and
rare
they
abandon
vital
matters
to
be
tickled
with
a
straw
but
the
straw
that
they
were
tickled
with
the
chaff
that
they
were
fed
with
they
convert
into
a
weaver
beam
to
break
their
foeman
head
with
for
undemocratic
reasons
and
for
motives
not
of
state
they
arrive
at
their
conclusions
largely
inarticulate
being
void
of
they
confide
their
views
to
none
but
sometimes
in
a
one
learns
why
things
were
done
in
telegraphic
sentences
half
swallowed
at
the
ends
they
hint
a
matter
inwardness
and
there
the
matter
ends
and
while
the
celt
is
talking
from
valencia
to
kirkwall
the
english
ah
the
english
do
say
anything
at
all
little
foxes
a
tale
of
the
gihon
hunt
a
fox
came
out
of
his
earth
on
the
banks
of
the
great
river
gihon
which
waters
ethiopia
he
saw
a
white
man
riding
through
the
dry
and
that
his
destiny
might
be
fulfilled
barked
at
him
the
rider
drew
rein
among
the
villagers
round
his
stirrup
what
said
he
is
that
that
said
the
sheikh
of
the
village
is
a
fox
o
excellency
our
it
is
not
then
a
jackal
no
jackal
but
abu
hussein
the
father
of
also
the
white
man
spoke
half
aloud
i
am
mudir
of
this
it
is
true
they
cried
ya
saart
el
mudir
o
excellency
our
governor
the
great
river
gihon
well
used
to
the
moods
of
kings
slid
between
his
banks
toward
the
sea
while
the
governor
praised
god
in
a
loud
and
searching
cry
never
before
heard
by
the
river
when
he
had
lowered
his
right
forefinger
from
behind
his
right
ear
the
villagers
talked
to
him
of
their
crops
barley
dhurrah
millet
onions
and
the
like
the
governor
stood
in
his
stirrups
north
he
looked
up
a
strip
of
green
cultivation
a
few
hundred
yards
wide
that
lay
like
a
carpet
between
the
river
and
the
tawny
line
of
the
desert
sixty
miles
that
strip
stretched
before
him
and
as
many
behind
at
every
a
groaning
lifted
the
soft
water
from
the
river
to
the
crops
by
way
of
a
aqueduct
a
foot
or
so
wide
was
the
five
foot
or
more
high
was
the
bank
on
which
it
ran
and
its
base
was
broad
in
proportion
abu
hussein
misnamed
the
father
of
cunning
drank
from
the
river
below
his
earth
and
his
shadow
was
long
in
the
low
sun
he
could
not
understand
the
loud
cry
which
the
governor
had
cried
the
sheikh
of
the
village
spoke
of
the
crops
from
which
the
rulers
of
all
lands
draw
revenue
but
the
governor
eyes
were
fixed
between
his
horse
ears
on
the
nearest
very
like
a
ditch
in
ireland
he
murmured
and
smiled
dreaming
of
a
bank
in
distant
kildare
encouraged
by
that
smile
the
sheikh
continued
when
crops
fail
it
is
necessary
to
remit
taxation
then
it
is
a
good
thing
o
excellency
our
governor
that
you
come
and
see
the
crops
which
have
failed
and
discover
that
we
have
not
the
governor
shortened
his
reins
the
horse
cantered
on
rose
at
the
embankment
of
the
changed
leg
cleverly
on
top
and
hopped
down
in
a
cloud
of
golden
dust
abu

interest
he
had
never
before
seen
such
things
assuredly
the
governor
repeated
and
came
back
by
the
way
he
had
gone
it
is
always
best
to
see
for
one
an
ancient
and
still
steamer
with
a
barge
lashed
to
her
side
came
round
the
river
bend
she
whistled
to
tell
the
governor
his
dinner
was
ready
and
the
horse
seeing
his
fodder
piled
on
the
barge
whinnied
back
moreover
the
sheikh
added
in
the
days
of
the
oppression
the
emirs
and
their
creatures
dispossessed
many
people
of
their
lands
all
up
and
down
the
river
our
people
are
waiting
to
return
to
their
lawful
judges
have
been
appointed
to
settle
that
matter
said
the
governor
they
will
presently
come
in
steamers
and
hear
the
wherefore
did
the
judges
kill
the
emirs
we
would
rather
be
judged
by
the
men
who
executed
god
judgment
on
the
emirs
we
would
rather
abide
by
your
decision
o
excellency
our
the
governor
nodded
it
was
a
year
since
he
had
seen
the
emirs
stretched
close
and
still
round
the
reddened
sheepskin
where
lay
el
mahdi
the
prophet
of
god
now
there
remained
no
trace
of
their
dominion
except
the
old
steamer
once
part
of
a
dervish
flotilla
which
was
his
house
and
office
she
sidled
into
the
shore
lowered
a
plank
and
the
governor
followed
his
horse
aboard
lights
burned
on
her
till
late
dully
reflected
in
the
river
that
tugged
at
her
the
governor
read
not
for
the
first
time
the
administration
reports
of
one
john
jorrocks
we
shall
need
he
said
suddenly
to
his
inspector
about
ten
couple
i
get
when
i
go
home
you
be
whip
baker
the
inspector
who
was
not
yet
signified
his
assent
in
the
usual
manner
while
abu
hussein
barked
at
the
vast
desert
moon
ha
said
the
governor
coming
out
in
his
pyjamas
we
be
giving
you
capivi
in
another
three
months
my
it
was
four
as
a
matter
of
fact
ere
a
steamer
with
a
melodious
bargeful
of
hounds
anchored
at
that
landing
the
inspector
leaped
down
among
them
and
the
homesick
wanderers
received
him
as
a
brother
everybody
fed
everything
on
board
ship
but
they
real
dainty
hounds
at
bottom
the
governor
explained
that
royal
you
got
hold
of
the
pick
of
the
bunch
and
the
bitch
that
got
hold
of
you
a
little
excited
is
may
queen
merriman
out
of
cottesmore
maudlin
you
i
know
old
betch
with
the
tan
eyebrows
the
inspector
cooed
oh
ben
i
shall
take
an
interest
in
life
now
hark
to
o
hark
abu
hussein
under
the
high
bank
went
about
his
night
work
an
eddy
carried
his
scent
to
the
barge
and
three
villages
heard
the
crash
of
music
that
followed
even
then
abu
hussein
did
not
know
better
than
to
bark
in
reply
well
what
about
my
province
the
governor
asked
not
so
bad
the
inspector
answered
with
royal
head
between
his
knees
of
course
all
the
villages
want
remission
of
taxes
but
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
whole
country
stinkin
with
foxes
our
trouble
will
be
choppin
in
cover
i
got
a
list
of
the
only
villages
entitled
to
any
remission
what
call
this
beast
with
the
jowl
i
have
my
doubts
about
him
do
you
think
we
can
get
two
days
a
week
easy
and
as
many
byes
as
you
please
the
sheikh
of
this
village
here
tells
me
that
his
barley
has
failed
and
he
wants
a
fifty
per
cent
we
begin
with
him
and
look
at
his
crops
as
we
go
nothing
like
personal
supervision
said
the
governor
they
began
at
sunrise
the
pack
flew
off
the
barge
in
every
direction
and
after
gambols
dug
like
terriers
at
abu
hussein
many
earths
then
they
drank
themselves
on
gihon
water
while
the
governor
and
the
inspector
chastised
them
with
whips
scorpions
were
added
for
may
queen
nosed
one
and
was
removed
to
the
barge
lamenting
mystery
a
puppy
alas
met
a
snake
and
the
never
a
dainty
hound
ate
that
which
he
should
have
passed
by
only
royal
of
the
belvoir
tan
head
and
the
sad
discerning
eyes
made
any
attempt
to
uphold
the
honour
of
england
before
the
watching
village
you
ca
expect
everything
said
the
governor
after
breakfast
we
got
it
though
everything
except
foxes
have
you
seen
may
nose
said
the
inspector
and
mystery
dead
we
keep
coupled
next
time
till
we
get
well
in
among
the
crops
i
say
what
a
babbling
that
is
ought
to
be
drowned
they
bury
people
so
damn
casual
hereabouts
give
him
another
chance
the
inspector
pleaded
not
knowing
that
he
should
live
to
repent
most
bitterly
talkin
of
chances
said
the
governor
this
sheikh
lies
about
his
barley
bein
a
failure
if
it
high
enough
to
hide
a
hound
at
this
time
of
year
it
all
right
and
he
wants
a
fifty
per
cent
remission
you
said
you
did
go
on
past
the
melon
patch
where
i
tried
to
turn
wanderer
it
all
burned
up
from
there
on
to
the
desert
his
other
has
broken
down
too
the
inspector
replied
very
good
we
split
the
difference
and
allow
him
per
cent
off
where
we
meet
there
some
trouble
among
the
villages
down
the
river
about
their
it
good
goin
ground
there
too
the
inspector
said
the
next
meet
then
was
some
twenty
miles
down
the
river
and
the
pack
were
not
enlarged
till
they
were
fairly
among
the
fields
abu
hussein
was
there
in
force
four
of
him
four
delirious
hunts
of
four
minutes
each
four
hounds
per
fox
ended
in
four
earths
just
above
the
river
all
the
village
looked
on
we
forgot
about
the
earths
the
banks
are
riddled
with
defeat
us
said
the
inspector
wait
a
moment
the
governor
drew
forth
a
sneezing
hound
i
just
remembered
i
governor
of
these
then
turn
out
a
black
battalion
to
stop
for
us
we
need
old
the
governor
straightened
his
back
give
ear
o
people
he
cried
i
make
a
new
law
the
villagers
closed
in
he
called
henceforward
i
will
give
one
dollar
to
the
man
on
whose
land
abu
hussein
is
found
and
another
dollar
he
held
up
the
coin
to
the
man
on
whose
land
these
dogs
shall
kill
him
but
to
the
man
on
whose
land
abu
hussein
shall
run
into
a
hole
such
as
is
this
hole
i
will
give
not
dollars
but
a
most
unmeasurable
beating
is
it
understood
our
excellency
a
man
stepped
forth
on
my
land
abu
hussein
was
found
this
morning
is
it
not
so
brothers
none
denied
the
governor
tossed
him
over
four
dollars
without
a
word
on
my
land
they
all
went
into
their
holes
cried
another
therefore
i
must
be
not
so
the
land
is
mine
and
mine
are
the
this
second
speaker
thrust
forward
his
shoulders
already
bared
and
the
villagers
shouted
hullo
two
men
anxious
to
be
licked
there
must
be
some
swindle
about
the
land
said
the
governor
then
in
the
local
vernacular
what
are
your
rights
to
the
beating
as
a
changes
beneath
a
slant
of
the
sun
that
which
had
been
a
scattered
mob
changed
to
a
court
of
most
ancient
justice
the
hounds
tore
and
sobbed
at
abu
hussein
hearthstone
all
unnoticed
among
the
legs
of
the
witnesses
and
gihon
also
accustomed
to
laws
purred
approval
you
will
not
wait
till
the
judges
come
up
the
river
to
settle
the
dispute
said
the
governor
at
last
no
shouted
all
the
village
save
the
man
who
had
first
asked
to
be
beaten
we
will
abide
by
our
excellency
decision
let
our
excellency
turn
out
the
creatures
of
the
emirs
who
stole
our
land
in
the
days
of
the
and
thou
sayest
the
governor
turned
to
the
man
who
had
first
asked
to
be
beaten
i
say
will
wait
till
the
wise
judges
come
down
in
the
steamer
then
i
will
bring
my
many
witnesses
he
replied
he
is
rich
he
will
bring
many
witnesses
the
village
sheikh
muttered
no
need
thy
own
mouth
condemns
thee
the
governor
cried
no
man
lawfully
entitled
to
his
land
would
wait
one
hour
before
entering
upon
it
stand
aside
the
man
fell
back
and
the
village
jeered
him
the
second
claimant
stooped
quickly
beneath
the
lifted
the
village
rejoiced
oh
such
an
one
son
of
such
an
one
said
the
governor
prompted
by
the
sheikh
learn
from
the
day
when
i
send
the
order
to
block
up
all
the
holes
where
abu
hussein
may
hide
on
thy
land
the
light
flicks
ended
the
man
stood
up
triumphant
by
that
accolade
had
the
supreme
government
acknowledged
his
title
before
all
men
while
the
village
praised
the
perspicacity
of
the
governor
a
naked
child
strode
forward
to
the
earth
and
stood
on
one
leg
unconcerned
as
a
young
stork
hal
he
said
hands
behind
his
back
this
should
be
blocked
up
with
bundles
of
dhurra
stalks
or
better
bundles
of
better
thorns
said
the
governor
thick
ends
the
child
nodded
gravely
and
squatted
on
the
sand
an
evil
day
for
thee
abu
hussein
he
shrilled
into
the
mouth
of
the
earth
a
day
of
obstacles
to
thy
flagitious
returns
in
the
who
is
it
the
governor
asked
the
sheikh
it
farag
the
fatherless
his
people
were
slain
in
the
days
of
the
oppression
the
man
to
whom
our
excellency
has
awarded
the
land
is
as
it
were
his
maternal
will
it
come
with
me
and
feed
the
big
dogs
said
the
governor
the
other
peering
children
drew
back
run
they
cried
our
excellency
will
feed
farag
to
the
big
i
will
come
said
farag
and
i
will
never
he
threw
his
arm
round
royal
neck
and
the
wise
beast
licked
his
face
binjamin
by
jove
the
inspector
cried
no
said
the
governor
i
believe
he
has
the
makings
of
a
james
pigg
farag
waved
his
hand
to
his
uncle
and
led
royal
on
to
the
barge
the
rest
of
the
pack
followed
gihon
that
had
seen
many
sports
learned
to
know
the
hunt
barge
well
he
met
her
rounding
his
bends
on
grey
december
dawns
to
music
wild
and
lamentable
as
the
almost
forgotten
throb
of
dervish
drums
when
high
above
royal
tenor
bell
sharper
even
than
lying
falsetto
break
farag
chanted
deathless
war
against
abu
hussein
and
all
his
seed
at
sunrise
the
river
would
shoulder
her
carefully
into
her
place
and
listen
to
the
rush
and
scutter
of
the
pack
fleeing
up
the
and
the
tramp
of
the
governor
arab
behind
them
they
would
pass
over
the
brow
into
the
dewless
crops
where
gihon
low
and
shrunken
could
only
guess
what
they
were
about
when
abu
hussein
flew
down
the
bank
to
scratch
at
a
stopped
earth
and
flew
back
into
the
barley
again
as
farag
had
foretold
it
was
evil
days
for
abu
hussein
ere
he
learned
to
take
the
necessary
steps
and
to
get
away
crisply
sometimes
gihon
saw
the
whole
procession
of
the
hunt
silhouetted
against
the
bearing
him
company
for
many
merry
miles
at
every
half
mile
the
horses
and
the
donkeys
jumped
the
up
on
change
your
leg
and
off
again
like
figures
in
a
zoetrope
till
they
grew
small
along
the
line
of
waterwheels
then
gibon
waited
their
rustling
return
through
the
crops
and
took
them
to
rest
on
his
bosom
at
ten
while
the
horses
ate
and
farag
slept
with
his
head
on
royal
flank
the
governor
and
his
inspector
worked
for
the
good
of
the
hunt
and
his
province
after
a
little
time
there
was
no
need
to
beat
any
man
for
neglecting
his
earths
the
steamer
destination
was
telegraphed
from
waterwheel
to
waterwheel
and
the
villagers
stopped
out
and
put
to
according
if
an
earth
were
overlooked
it
meant
some
dispute
as
to
the
ownership
of
the
land
and
then
and
there
the
hunt
checked
and
settled
it
in
this
wise
the
governor
and
the
inspector
side
by
side
but
the
latter
half
a
horse
length
to
the
rear
both
claimants
well
in
front
the
villagers
behind
them
and
farag
with
the
pack
who
quite
understood
the
performance
sitting
down
on
the
left
twenty
minutes
were
enough
to
settle
the
most
complicated
case
for
as
the
governor
said
to
a
judge
on
the
steamer
one
gets
at
the
truth
in
a
a
heap
quicker
than
in
your
but
when
the
evidence
is
conflicting
the
judge
suggested
watch
the
field
they
throw
tongue
fast
enough
if
you
running
a
wrong
scent
you
never
had
an
appeal
from
one
of
my
decisions
the
sheikhs
on
horseback
the
lesser
folk
on
clever
donkeys
the
children
so
despised
by
farag
soon
understood
that
villages
which
repaired
their
waterwheels
and
channels
stood
highest
in
the
favour
he
bought
their
barley
for
his
horses
channels
he
said
are
necessary
that
we
may
all
jump
them
they
are
necessary
moreover
for
the
crops
let
there
be
many
wheels
and
sound
channels
and
much
good
without
money
replied
an
aged
sheikh
there
are
no
i
will
lend
the
money
said
the
governor
at
what
interest
o
our
excellency
take
you
two
of
may
queen
puppies
to
bring
up
in
your
village
in
such
a
manner
that
they
do
not
eat
filth
nor
lose
their
hair
nor
catch
fever
from
lying
in
the
sun
but
become
wise
like
not
like
bigglebai
already
it
was
an
insult
along
the
river
to
compare
a
man
to
the
shifty
anthropophagous
harrier
certainly
like
not
in
the
least
like
bigglebai
that
shall
be
the
interest
on
the
loan
let
the
puppies
thrive
and
the
waterwheel
be
built
and
i
shall
be
content
said
the
governor
the
wheel
shall
be
built
but
o
our
excellency
if
by
god
favour
the
pups
grow
to
be
not
not
unaccustomed
to
their
names
not
lawless
who
will
do
them
and
me
justice
at
the
time
of
judging
the
young
dogs
hounds
man

o
sheikh
we
call
them
in
their
the
when
they
are
judged
at
the
i
have
unfriends
down
the
river
to
whom
our
excellency
has
also
entrusted
to
bring
puppies
man
we
call
them
o
sheikh
in
their
my
enemies
may
judge
my
unjustly
at
the
this
must
be
thought
i
see
the
obstacle
hear
now
if
the
new
waterwheel
is
built
in
a
month
without
oppression
thou
o
sheikh
shalt
be
named
one
of
the
judges
to
judge
the
at
the
is
it
understood
understood
we
will
build
the
wheel
i
and
my
seed
are
responsible
for
the
repayment
of
the
loan
where
are
my
if
they
eat
fowls
must
they
on
any
account
eat
the
feathers
on
no
account
must
they
eat
the
feathers
farag
in
the
barge
will
tell
thee
how
they
are
to
there
is
no
instance
of
any
default
on
the
governor
personal
and
unauthorized
loans
for
which
they
called
him
the
father
of
waterwheels
but
the
first
puppyshow
at
the
capital
needed
enormous
tact
and
the
presence
of
a
black
battalion
ostentatiously
drilling
in
the
barrack
square
to
prevent
trouble
after
the
but
who
can
chronicle
the
glories
of
the
gihon
hunt
or
their
shames
who
remembers
the
kill
in
the
when
the
governor
bade
the
assembled
sheikhs
and
warriors
observe
how
the
hounds
would
instantly
devour
the
body
of
abu
hussein
but
how
when
he
had
scientifically
broken
it
up
the
weary
pack
turned
from
it
in
loathing
and
farag
wept
because
he
said
the
world
face
had
been
blackened
what
men
who
have
not
yet
ridden
beyond
the
sound
of
any
horn
recall
the
midnight
run
which
ended
beagleboy
leading
among
tombs
the
hasty
and
the
oath
taken
abo
e
bones
to
forget
the
worry
the
desert
run
when
abu
hussein
forsook
the
cultivation
and
made
a
point
to
earth
in
a
desolate
khor
when
strange
armed
riders
on
camels
swooped
out
of
a
ravine
and
instead
of
giving
battle
offered
to
take
the
tired
hounds
home
on
their
beasts
which
they
did
and
vanished
above
all
who
remembers
the
death
of
royal
when
a
certain
sheikh
wept
above
the
body
of
the
stainless
hound
as
it
might
have
been
his
son
and
that
day
the
hunt
rode
no
more
the
says
little
of
this
but
at
the
end
of
their
second
season
brace
appears
the
dark
entry
new
blood
badly
wanted
they
are
beginning
to
listen
to
the
inspector
attended
to
the
matter
when
his
leave
fell
due
remember
said
the
governor
you
must
get
us
the
best
blood
in
england
real
dainty
hounds
expense
no
object
but
do
trust
your
own
judgment
present
my
letters
of
introduction
and
take
what
they
give
the
inspector
presented
his
letters
in
a
society
where
they
make
much
of
horses
more
of
hounds
and
are
tolerably
civil
to
men
who
can
ride
they
passed
him
from
house
to
house
mounted
him
according
to
his
merits
and
fed
him
after
five
years
of
goat
chop
and
worcester
sauce
perhaps
a
thought
too
richly
the
seat
or
castle
where
he
made
his
great
coup
does
not
much
matter
four
masters
of
foxhounds
were
at
table
and
in
a
mellow
hour
the
inspector
told
them
stories
of
the
gihon
hunt
he
ended
ben
said
i
was
to
trust
my
own
judgment
about
hounds
but
i
think
there
ought
to
be
a
special
tariff
for
as
soon
as
his
hosts
could
speak
they
reassured
him
on
this
point
and
now
tell
us
about
your
first
all
over
again
said
one
and
about
the
was
that
all
ben
own
invention
said
another
wait
a
moment
said
a
large
man
not
an
at
the
end
of
the
table
are
your
villagers
habitually
beaten
by
your
governor
when
they
fail
to
stop
foxes
holes
the
tone
and
the
phrase
were
enough
even
if
as
the
inspector
confessed
afterwards
the
big
blue
man
had
not
looked
so
like
he
took
him
on
for
the
honour
of
ethiopia
we
only
hunt
twice
a
week
sometimes
three
times
i
never
known
a
man
chastised
more
than
four
times
a
week
unless
there
a
the
large
man
flung
his
napkin
down
came
round
the
table
cast
himself
into
the
chair
next
the
inspector
and
leaned
forward
earnestly
so
that
he
breathed
in
the
inspector
face
chastised
with
what
he
said
with
the
kourbash
on
the
feet
a
kourbash
is
a
strip
of
old
with
a
sort
of
keel
on
it
like
the
cutting
edge
of
a
boar
tusk
but
we
use
the
rounded
side
for
a
first
and
do
any
consequences
follow
this
sort
of
thing
for
the
victim
i
mean
not
for
you
rarely
let
me
be
fair
i
never
seen
a
man
die
under
the
lash
but
gangrene
may
set
up
if
the
kourbash
has
been
pickled
in
what
all
the
table
was
still
and
interested
in
copperas
of
course
did
you
know
that
said
the
inspector
thank
god
i
the
large
man
sputtered
visibly
the
inspector
wiped
his
face
and
grew
bolder
you
must
think
we
careless
about
our
earthstoppers
we
a
hunt
fund
for
hot
tar
tar
a
splendid
dressing
if
the
beaten
off
but
huntin
as
large
a
country
as
we
do
we
may
be
back
at
that
village
for
a
month
and
if
the
dressings
ai
renewed
and
gangrene
sets
in
often
as
not
you
find
your
man
pegging
about
on
his
stumps
we
a
local
name
for
down
the
river
we
call
the
mudir
cranes
you
see
i
persuaded
the
governor
only
to
bastinado
on
one
on
one
foot
the
mudir
cranes
the
large
man
turned
purple
to
the
top
of
his
bald
head
would
you
mind
giving
me
the
local
word
for
mudir
cranes
from
a
too
memory
the
inspector
drew
one
short
adhesive
word
which
surprises
by
itself
even
unblushing
ethiopia
he
spelt
it
out
saw
the
large
man
write
it
down
on
his
cuff
and
withdraw
then
the
inspector
translated
a
few
of
its
significations
and
implications
to
the
four
masters
of
foxhounds
he
left
three
days
later
with
eight
couple
of
the
best
hounds
in
england
a
free
and
a
friendly
and
an
ample
gift
from
four
packs
to
the
gihon
hunt
he
had
honestly
meant
to
undeceive
the
large
blue
mottled
man
but
somehow
forgot
about
it
the
new
draft
marks
a
new
chapter
in
the
hunt
history
from
an
isolated
phenomenon
in
a
barge
it
became
a
permanent
institution
with
kennels
ashore
and
an
influence
social
political
and
administrative
with
the
boundaries
of
the
province
ben
the
governor
departed
to
england
where
he
kept
a
pack
of
real
dainty
hounds
but
never
ceased
to
long
for
the
old
lawless
lot
his
successors
were
masters
of
the
gihon
hunt
as
all
inspectors
were
whips
for
one
reason
farag
the
kennel
huntsman
in
khaki
and
puttees
would
obey
nothing
under
the
rank
of
an
excellency
and
the
hounds
would
obey
no
one
but
farag
for
another
the
best
way
of
estimating
crop
returns
and
revenue
was
by
riding
straight
to
hounds
for
a
third
though
judges
down
the
river
issued
signed
and
sealed
to
all
lawful
owners
yet
public
opinion
along
the
river
never
held
any
such
title
valid
till
it
had
been
confirmed
according
to
precedent
by
the
governor
hunting
crop
in
the
hunting
field
above
the
wilfully
neglected
earth
true
the
ceremony
had
been
cut
down
to
three
mere
taps
on
the
shoulder
but
governors
who
tried
to
evade
that
much
found
themselves
and
their
office
compassed
about
with
a
great
cloud
of
witnesses
who
took
up
their
time
with
lawsuits
and
worse
still
neglected
the
puppies
the
older
sheikhs
indeed
stood
out
for
the
unmeasurable
beatings
of
the
old
days
the
sharper
the
punishment
they
argued
the
surer
the
title
but
here
the
hand
of
modern
progress
was
against
them
and
they
contented
themselves
with
telling
tales
of
ben
the
first
governor
whom
they
called
the
father
of
waterwheels
and
of
that
heroic
age
when
men
horses
and
hounds
were
worth
following
this
same
modern
progress
which
brought
dog
biscuit
and
brass
to
the
kennels
was
at
work
all
over
the
world
forces
activities
and
movements
sprang
into
being
agitated
themselves
coalesced
and
in
one
political
avalanche
overwhelmed
a
bewildered
and
not
in
the
least
intending
it
england
the
echoes
of
the
new
era
were
borne
into
the
province
on
the
wings
of
inexplicable
cables
the
gihon
hunt
read
speeches
and
sentiments
and
policies
which
amazed
them
and
they
thanked
god
prematurely
that
their
province
was
too
far
off
too
hot
and
too
hard
worked
to
be
reached
by
those
speakers
or
their
policies
but
they
with
others
the
scope
and
purpose
of
the
new
era
one
by
one
the
provinces
of
the
empire
were
hauled
up
and
baited
hit
and
held
lashed
under
the
belly
and
forced
back
on
their
haunches
for
the
amusement
of
their
new
masters
in
the
parish
of
westminster
one
by
one
they
fell
away
sore
and
angry
to
compare
stripes
with
each
other
at
the
ends
of
the
uneasy
earth
even
so
the
gihon
hunt
like
abu
hussein
in
the
old
days
did
not
understand
then
it
reached
them
through
the
press
that
they
habitually
flogged
to
death
good
cultivators
who
neglected
to
stop
earths
but
that
the
few
the
very
few
who
did
not
die
under
hippohide
whips
soaked
in
copperas
walked
about
on
their
gangrenous
and
were
known
in
derision
as
the
mudir
cranes
the
charges
were
vouched
for
in
the
house
of
commons
by
a
lethabie
groombride
who
had
formed
a
committee
and
was
disseminating
literature
the
province
groaned
the
inspector
now
an
inspector
of
inspectors
whistled
he
had
forgotten
the
gentleman
who
sputtered
in
people
faces
he
should
have
looked
so
like
was
his
sole
defence
when
he
met
the
governor
at
breakfast
on
the
steamer
after
a
meet
you
should
have
joked
with
an
animal
of
that
class
said
peter
the
governor
look
what
farag
has
brought
me
it
was
a
pamphlet
signed
on
behalf
of
a
committee
by
a
lady
secretary
but
composed
by
some
person
who
thoroughly
understood
the
language
of
the
province
after
telling
the
tale
of
the
beatings
it
recommended
all
the
beaten
to
institute
criminal
proceedings
against
their
governor
and
as
soon
as
might
be
to
rise
against
english
oppression
and
tyranny
such
documents
were
new
in
ethiopia
in
those
days
the
inspector
read
the
last
half
page
but
but
he
stammered
this
is
impossible
white
men
do
write
this
sort
of
do
they
just
said
the
governor
they
get
made
cabinet
ministers
for
doing
it
too
i
went
home
last
year
i
it
blow
over
said
the
inspector
weakly
not
it
groombride
is
coming
down
here
to
investigate
the
matter
in
a
few
for
himself
the
imperial
government
behind
him
perhaps
you
like
to
look
t
my
the
governor
laid
down
an
uncoded
cable
the
whiplash
to
it
ran
you
will
afford
groombride
every
facility
for
his
inquiry
and
will
be
held
responsible
that
no
obstacles
are
put
in
his
way
to
the
fullest
possible
examination
of
any
witnesses
which
he
may
consider
necessary
he
will
be
accompanied
by
his
own
interpreter
who
must
not
be
tampered
that
to
me
governor
of
the
province
said
peter
the
governor
it
seems
about
enough
the
inspector
answered
farag
entered
the
saloon
as
was
his
privilege
my
uncle
who
was
beaten
by
the
father
of
waterwheels
would
approach
o
excellency
he
said
and
there
are
others
on
the
admit
said
the
governor
there
tramped
aboard
sheikhs
and
villagers
to
the
number
of
seventeen
in
each
man
hand
was
a
copy
of
the
pamphlet
in
each
man
eye
terror
and
uneasiness
of
the
sort
that
governors
spend
and
are
spent
to
clear
away
farag
uncle
now
sheikh
of
the
village
spoke
it
is
written
in
this
book
excellency
that
the
beatings
whereby
we
hold
our
lands
are
all
valueless
it
is
written
that
every
man
who
received
such
a
beating
from
the
father
of
waterwheels
who
slow
the
emirs
should
instantly
begin
a
lawsuit
because
the
title
to
his
land
is
not
it
is
so
written
we
do
not
wish
lawsuits
we
wish
to
hold
the
land
as
it
was
given
to
us
after
the
days
of
the
oppression
they
cried
the
governor
glanced
at
the
inspector
this
was
serious
to
cast
doubt
on
the
ownership
of
land
means
in
ethiopia
the
letting
in
of
waters
and
the
getting
out
of
troops
your
titles
are
good
said
the
governor
the
inspector
confirmed
with
a
nod
then
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
writings
which
came
from
down
the
river
where
the
judges
are
farag
uncle
waved
his
copy
by
whose
order
are
we
ordered
to
slay
you
o
excellency
our
governor
it
is
not
written
that
you
are
to
slay
not
in
those
very
words
but
if
we
leave
an
earth
unstopped
it
is
the
same
as
though
we
wished
to
save
abu
hussein
from
the
hounds
these
writings
say
your
rulers
how
can
we
abolish
except
we
kill
we
hear
rumours
of
one
who
comes
from
down
the
river
soon
to
lead
us
to
fools
said
the
governor
your
titles
are
good
this
is
madness
it
is
so
written
they
answered
like
a
pack
listen
said
the
inspector
smoothly
i
know
who
caused
the
writings
to
be
written
and
sent
he
is
a
man
of
a
jowl
in
aspect
like
bigglebai
who
ate
unclean
matters
he
will
come
up
the
river
and
will
give
tongue
about
the
will
he
impeach
our
an
evil
day
for
him
go
slow
baker
the
governor
whispered
they
kill
him
if
they
get
scared
about
their

the
inspector
lit
a
cigarette
declare
which
of
you
took
to

of

farag

the
inspector

said
farag
uncle
they
died
of
the
madness
in
their
ninth
and
how
did
they
do
before
they
died
said
the
inspector
they
ran
about
in
the
sun
and
slavered
at
the
mouth
till
they
wherefore
god
knows
he
sent
the
madness
it
was
no
fault
of
thy
own
mouth
hath
answered
the
inspector
laughed
it
is
with
men
as
it
is
with
dogs
god
afflicts
some
with
a
madness
it
is
no
fault
of
ours
if
such
men
run
about
in
the
sun
and
froth
at
the
mouth
the
man
who
is
coming
will
emit
spray
from
his
mouth
in
speaking
and
will
always
edge
and
push
in
towards
his
hearers
when
ye
see
and
hear
him
ye
will
understand
that
he
is
afflicted
of
god
being
mad
he
is
in
but
our
titles
are
our
titles
to
our
lands
good
the
crowd
repeated
your
titles
are
in
my
hands
they
are
good
said
the
governor
and
he
who
wrote
the
writings
is
an
afflicted
of
god
said
uncle
the
inspector
hath
said
it
cried
the
governor
ye
will
see
when
the
man
comes
o
sheikhs
and
men
have
we
ridden
together
and
walked
puppies
together
and
bought
and
sold
barley
for
the
horses
that
after
these
years
we
should
run
riot
on
the
scent
of
a
madman
an
afflicted
of
god
but
the
hunt
pays
us
to
kill
mad
jackals
said
farag
uncle
and
he
who
questions
my
titles
to
my
land
aahh
riot
the
governor
cracked
like
a
by
allah
he
thundered
if
the
afflicted
of
god
come
to
any
harm
at
your
hands
i
myself
will
shoot
every
hound
and
every
puppy
and
the
hunt
shall
ride
no
more
on
your
heads
be

go
in
peace
and
tell

farag
uncle
then
how
can
the

will
not
harm
a
hair
on
the
head
of
the
afflicted
of
god
he
shall
be
to
us
as
is
abu
hussein
wife
in
the
breeding
when
they
were
gone
the
governor
mopped
his
forehead
we
must
put
a
few
soldiers
in
every
village
this
groombride
visits
baker
tell
to
keep
out
of

the

country
life
square
on
the
table

of

who
resembles
bigglebai
one
with
the
man
whom
the
inspector
met
in
the
great
house
in
england
and
to
whom
he
told
the
tale
of
the
mudir
cranes
the
same
man
farag
said
the
inspector
i
have
often
heard
the
inspector
tell
the
tale
to
our
excellency
at
in
the
kennels
but
since
i
am
in
the
government
service
i
have
never
told
it
to
my
people
may
i
loose
that
tale
among
the
villages
the
governor
nodded
no
harm
said
he
the
details
of
groombride
arrival
with
his
interpreter
whom
he
proposed
should
eat
with
him
at
the
governor
table
his
allocution
to
the
governor
on
the
new
movement
and
the
sins
of
imperialism

purposely
omit
at
three
in
the
afternoon
groombride
said
i
will
go
out
now
and
address
your
victims
in
this
wo
you
find
it
rather
hot
said
the
governor
they
generally
take
nap
till
sunset
at
this
time
of
groombride
large
loose
lips
set
that
he
replied
pointedly
would
be
enough
to
decide
me
i
fear
you
have
not
quite
mastered
your
instructions
may
i
ask
you
to
send
for
my
interpreter
i
hope
he
has
not
been
tampered
with
by
your
he
was
a
yellowish
boy
called
abdul
who
had
well
eaten
and
drunk
with
farag
the
inspector
by
the
way
was
not
present
at
the
meal
at
whatever
risk
i
shall
go
unattended
said
groombride
your
presence
would
cow
them
from
giving
evidence
abdul
my
good
friend
would
you
very
kindly
open
the
umbrella
he
passed
up
the
to
the
village
and
with
no
more
prelude
than
a
salvation
army
picket
in
a
portsmouth
slum
cried
oh
my
brothers
he
did
not
guess
how
his
path
had
been
prepared
the
village
was
widely
awake
farag
in
loose
flowing
garments
quite
unlike
a
kennel
huntsman
khaki
and
puttees
leaned
against
the
wall
of
his
house
come
and
see
the
afflicted
of
god
he
cried
musically
whose
face
indeed
resembles
that
of
the
village
came
and
decided
that
on
the
whole
farag
was
right
i
ca
quite
catch
what
they
are
saying
said
groombride
they
saying
they
very
much
pleased
to
see
you
sar
adbul
interpreted
then
i
do
think
they
might
have
sent
a
deputation
to
the
steamer
but
i
suppose
they
were
frightened
of
the
officials
tell
them
not
to
be
frightened
he
says
you
are
not
to
be
frightened
abdul
explained
a
child
here
sputtered
with
laughter
refrain
from
mirth
farag
cried
the
afflicted
of
god
is
the
guest
of
the
excellency
our
governor
we
are
responsible
for
every
hair
of
his
he
has
none
a
voice
spoke
he
has
the
white
and
the
shining
now
tell
them
what
i
have
come
for
abdul
and
please
keep
the
umbrella
well
up
i
think
i
shall
reserve
myself
for
my
little
vernacular
speech
at
the
approach
look
listen
abdul
chanted
the
afflicted
of
god
will
now
make
sport
presently
he
will
speak
in
your
tongue
and
will
consume
you
with
mirth
i
have
been
his
servant
for
three
weeks
i
will
tell
you
about
his
undergarments
and
his
perfumes
for
his
he
told
them
at
length
and
didst
thou
take
any
of
his
perfume
bottles
said
farag
at
the
end
i
am
his
servant
i
took
two
abdul
replied
ask
him
said
farag
uncle
what
he
knows
about
our
ye
young
men
are
all
he
waved
a
pamphlet
groombride
smiled
to
see
how
the
seed
sown
in
london
had
borne
fruit
by
gihon
lo
all
the
seniors
held
copies
of
the
pamphlet
he
knows
less
than
a
buffalo
he
told
me
on
the
steamer
that
he
was
driven
out
of
his
own
land
by
which
is
a
devil
inhabiting
crowds
and
assemblies
said
abdul
allah
between
us
and
evil
a
woman
cackled
from
the
darkness
of
a
hut
come
in
children
he
may
have
the
evil
no
my
aunt
said
farag
no
afflicted
of
god
has
an
evil
eye
wait
till
ye
hear
his
speech
which
he
will
deliver
i
have
heard
it
twice
from
they
seem
very
quick
to
grasp
the
point
how
far
have
you
got
abdul
all
about
the
beatings
sar
they
are
highly
do
forget
about
the
local
and
please
hold
the
umbrella
over
me
it
is
hopeless
to
destroy
unless
one
first
builds
he
may
not
have
the
evil
eye
farag
uncle
grunted
but
his
devil
led
him
too
certainly
to
question
my
ask
him
whether
he
still
doubts
my
or
mine
or
mine
cried
the
elders
what
odds
he
is
an
afflicted
of
god
farag
called
remember
the
tale
i
told
yes
but
he
is
an
englishman
and
doubtless
of
influence
or
our
excellency
would
not
entertain
him
bid
the
jackass
ask
sar
said
abdul
these
people
much
fearing
they
may
be
turned
out
of
their
land
in
consequence
of
your
remarks
therefore
they
ask
you
to
make
promise
no
bad
consequences
following
your
groombride
held
his
breath
and
turned
purple
then
he
stamped
his
foot
tell
them
he
cried
that
if
a
hair
of
any
one
of
their
heads
is
touched
by
any
official
on
any
account
whatever
all
england
shall
ring
with
it
good
god
what
callous
oppression
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
are
full
of
he
wiped
his
face
and
throwing
out
his
arms
cried
tell
them
oh
tell
the
poor
serfs
not
to
be
afraid
of
me
tell
them
i
come
to
redress
their
wrongs
not
heaven
knows
to
add
to
their
the
gurgle
of
the
practised
public
speaker
pleased
them
much
that
is
how
the
new
runs
out
in
the
kennel
said
farag
the
excellency
our
governor
entertains
him
that
he
may
make
sport
make
him
say
the
what
did
he
say
about
my
farag
uncle
was
not
to
be
turned
he
says
farag
interpreted
that
he
desires
nothing
better
than
that
you
should
live
on
your
lands
in
peace
he
talks
as
though
he
believed
himself
to
be
well
we
here
are
all
witnesses
to
what
he
has
said
now
go
forward
with
the
farag
uncle
smoothed
his
garments
how
diversely
hath
allah
made
his
creatures
on
one
he
bestows
strength
to
slay
emirs
another
he
causes
to
go
mad
and
wander
in
the
sun
like
the
afflicted
sons
of
yes
and
to
emit
spray
from
the
mouth
as
the
inspector
told
us
all
will
happen
as
the
inspector
foretold
said
farag
i
have
never
yet
seen
the
inspector
thrown
out
during
any
i
think
abdul
plucked
at
groombride
sleeves
i
think
perhaps
it
is
better
now
sar
if
you
give
your
fine
little
native
speech
they
not
understanding
english
but
much
pleased
at
your
condescensions
groombride
spun
round
if
they
only
knew
how
i
felt
towards
them
in
my
heart
if
i
could
express
a
tithe
of
my
feelings
i
must
stay
here
and
learn
the
language
hold
up
the
umbrella
abdull
i
think
my
little
speech
will
show
them
i
know
something
of
their
vie
it
was
a
short
simple
carefully
learned
address
and
the
accent
supervised
by
abdul
on
the
steamer
allowed
the
hearers
to
guess
its
meaning
which
was
a
request
to
see
one
of
the
mudir
cranes
since
the
desire
of
the
speaker
life
the
object
to
which
he
would
consecrate
his
days
was
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
mudir
cranes
but
first
he
must
behold
them
with
his
own
eyes
would
then
his
brethren
whom
he
loved
show
him
a
mudir
crane
whom
he
desired
to
love
once
twice
and
again
in
his
peroration
he
repeated
his
demand
using
always
that
they
might
see
he
was
acquainted
with
their
local
argot
using
always
i
say
the
word
which
the
inspector
had
given
him
in
england
long
ago
the
short
adhesive
word
which
by
itself
surprises
even
unblushing
ethiopia
there
are
limits
to
the
sublime
politeness
of
an
ancient
people
a
bulky
man
in
white
clothes
his
name
across
his
lower
shirtfront
spluttering
from
under
a
umbrella
almost
tearful
appeals
to
be
introduced
to
the
unintroducible
naming
loudly
the
unnameable
dancing
as
it
seemed
in
perverse
joy
at
mere
mention
of
the
unmentionable
found
those
limits
there
was
a
hush
and
then
such
mirth
as
gihon
through
his
centuries
had
never
heard
a
roar
like
to
the
roar
of
his
own
cataracts
in
flood
children
cast
themselves
on
the
ground
and
rolled
back
and
forth
cheering
and
whooping
strong
men
their
faces
hidden
in
their
clothes
swayed
in
silence
till
the
agony
became
insupportable
and
they
threw
up
their
heads
and
bayed
at
the
sun
women
mothers
and
virgins
shrilled
shriek
upon
mounting
shriek
and
slapped
their
thighs
as
it
might
have
been
the
roll
of
musketry
when
they
tried
to
draw
breath
some
voice
would
quack
out
the
word
and
the
riot
began
afresh
last
to
fall
was
the
abdul
he
held
on
to
the
edge
of
apoplexy
then
collapsed
throwing
the
umbrella
from
him
groombride
should
not
be
judged
too
harshly
exercise
and
strong
emotion
under
a
hot
sun
the
shock
of
public
ingratitude
for
the
moment
rued
his
spirit
he
furled
the
umbrella
and
with
t
beat
the
prostrate
abdul
crying
that
he
had
been
betrayed
in
which
posture
the
inspector
on
horseback
followed
by
the
governor
suddenly
found
him
that
all
very
well
said
the
inspector
when
he
had
taken
dramatically
dying
depositions
on
the
steamer
but
you
ca
hammer
a
native
merely
because
he
laughs
at
you
i
see
nothing
for
it
but
the
law
to
take
its
you
might
reduce
the
charge
to
er
tampering
with
an
interpreter
said
the
governor
groombride
was
too
far
gone
to
be
comforted
it
the
publicity
that
i
fear
he
wailed
is
there
no
possible
means
of
hushing
up
the
affair
you
do
know
what
a
question
a
single
question
in
the
house
means
to
a
man
of
my
position
the
ruin
of
my
political
career
i
assure
i
should
have
imagined
it
said
the
governor
thoughtfully
and
though
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
say
it
i
am
not
without
honour
in
my
own
country
or
influence
a
word
in
season
as
you
know
your
excellency
it
might
carry
an
official
the
governor
shuddered
yes
that
had
to
come
too
he
said
to
himself
well
look
here
if
i
tell
this
man
of
yours
to
withdraw
the
charge
against
you
you
can
go
to
gehenna
for
aught
i
care
the
only
condition
i
make
is
that
if
you
write
i
suppose
that
part
of
your
business
about
your
travels
you
do
praise
me
so
far
groombride

loyally

about
to
open

the

upon

whether
this
maker
of

or
a

should
bear
with
you
and
order

this

brings

the
house
surgeon
on
an
evening
after
easter
day
i
sat
at
a
table
in
a
homeward
bound
steamer
where
half
a
dozen
of
us
told
ghost
stories
as
our
party
broke
up
a
man
playing
patience
in
the
next
alcove
said
to
me
i
did
quite
catch
the
end
of
that
last
story
about
the
curse
on
the
family
it
turned
out
to
be
drains
i
explained
as
soon
as
new
ones
were
put
into
the
house
the
curse
was
lifted
i
believe
i
never
knew
the
people
ah
i
had
my
drains
up
twice
i
on
gravel
you
do
mean
to
say
you
a
ghost
in
your
house
why
did
you
join
our
party
any
more
orders
gentlemen
before
the
bar
closes
the
steward
interrupted
sit
down
again
and
have
one
with
me
said
the
patience
player
no
it
is
a
ghost
our
trouble
is
more
depression
than
anything
how
interesting
then
it
nothing
any
one
can
see
it
it
nothing
worse
than
a
little
depression
and
the
odd
part
is
that
there
has
been
a
death
in
the
house
since
it
was
built
in
the
lawyer
said
so
that
decided
me
my
good
lady
rather
and
he
made
me
pay
an
extra
thousand
for
how
curious
unusual
too
i
said
yes
ai
it
it
was
built
for
three
sisters
moultrie
was
the
name
three
old
maids
they
all
lived
together
the
eldest
owned
it
i
bought
it
from
her
lawyer
a
few
years
ago
and
if
i
spent
a
pound
on
the
place
first
and
last
i
must
have
spent
five
thousand
electric
light
new
servants
wing
garden
all
that
sort
of
thing
a
man
and
his
family
ought
to
be
happy
after
so
much
expense
ai
it
he
looked
at
me
through
the
bottom
of
his
glass
does
it
affect
your
family
much
my
good
lady
she
a
greek
by
the
way
and
myself
are
we
can
bear
up
against
depression
but
it
hard
on
my
little
girl
i
say
little
but
she
twenty
we
send
her
visiting
to
escape
it
she
almost
lived
at
hotels
and
hydros
last
year
but
that
is
pleasant
for
her
she
used
to
be
a
canary
a
perfect
canary
always
singing
you
ought
to
hear
her
she
does
sing
now
that
sort
of
thing
unwholesome
for
the
young
ai
it
ca
you
get
rid
of
the
place
i
suggested
not
except
at
a
sacrifice
and
we
are
fond
of
it
just
suits
us
three
we
love
it
if
we
were
what
do
you
mean
by
not
being
allowed
i
mean
because
of
the
depression
it
spoils
what
it
like
exactly
i
could
very
well
explain
it
must
be
seen
to
be
appreciated
as
the
auctioneers
say
now
i
was
much
impressed
by
the
story
you
were
telling
just
it
was
true
i
said
my
tale
is
true
if
you
would
do
me
the
pleasure
to
come
down
and
spend
a
night
at
my
little
place
you
learn
more
than
you
would
if
i
talked
till
morning
very
likely
touch
your
good
self
at
all
you
might
be
immune
ai
it
on
the
other
hand
if
this
influenza
influence
does
happen
to
affect
you
why
i
think
it
will
be
an
while
he
talked
he
gave
me
his
card
and
i
read
his
name
was
maxwell
of
holmescroft
a
city
address
was
tucked
away
in
a
corner
my
business
he
added
used
to
be
furs
if
you
are
interested
in
furs
i
given
thirty
years
of
my
life
to
you
very
kind
i
murmured
far
from
it
i
assure
you
i
can
meet
you
next
saturday
afternoon
anywhere
in
london
you
choose
to
name
and
i
be
only
too
happy
to
motor
you
down
it
ought
to
be
a
delightful
run
at
this
time
of
year
the
rhododendrons
will
be
out
i
mean
it
you
do
know
how
truly
i
mean
it
very
probably
it
wo
affect
you
at
all
and
i
think
i
may
say
i
have
the
finest
collection
of
narwhal
tusks
in
the
world
all
the
best
skins
and
horns
have
to
go
through
london
and
maxwell
he
knows
where
they
come
from
and
where
they
go
to
that
his
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
talked
to
me
of
the
assembling
preparation
and
sale
of
the
rarer
furs
and
told
me
things
about
the
manufacture
of
coats
which
quite
shocked
me
somehow
or
other
when
we
landed
on
wednesday
i
found
myself
pledged
to
spend
that
with
him
at
holmescroft
on
saturday
he
met
me
with
a
motor
and
ran
me
out
in
an
hour
and
a
half
to
an
exclusive
residential
district
of
dustless
roads
and
elegantly
designed
country
villas
each
standing
in
from
three
to
five
acres
of
perfectly
appointed
land
he
told
me
land
was
selling
at
eight
hundred
pounds
the
acre
and
the
new
golf
links
whose
queen
anne
pavilion
we
passed
had
cost
nearly
thousand
pounds
to
create
holmescroft
was
a
large
low
residence
a
verandah
at
the
south
side
gave
on
to
a
garden
and
two
tennis
courts
separated
by
a
tasteful
iron
fence
from
a
most
meadow
of
five
or
six
acres
where
two
jersey
cows
grazed
tea
was
ready
in
the
shade
of
a
promising
copper
beech
and
i
could
see
groups
on
the
lawn
of
young
men
and
maidens
appropriately
clothed
playing
lawn
tennis
in
the
sunshine
a
pretty
scene
ai
it
said
my
good
lady
sitting
under
the
tree
and
that
my
little
girl
in
pink
on
the
far
court
but
i
take
you
to
your
room
and
you
can
see
all
he
led
me
through
a
wide
hall
furnished
in
pale
lemon
with
huge
cloisonnee
vases
an
ebonized
and
gold
grand
piano
and
banks
of
pot
flowers
in
benares
brass
bowls
up
a
pale
oak
staircase
to
a
spacious
landing
where
there
was
a
green
velvet
settee
trimmed
with
silver
the
blinds
were
down
and
the
light
lay
in
parallel
lines
on
the
floors
he
showed
me
my
room
saying
cheerfully
you
may
be
a
little
tired
one
often
is
without
knowing
it
after
a
run
through
traffic
do
come
down
till
you
feel
quite
restored
we
shall
all
be
in
the
my
room
was
rather
warm
and
smelt
of
perfumed
soap
i
threw
up
the
window
at
once
but
it
opened
so
close
to
the
floor
and
worked
so
clumsily
that
i
came
within
an
ace
of
pitching
out
where
i
should
certainly
have
ruined
a
rather
laburnum
below
as
i
set
about
washing
off
the
journey
dust
i
began
to
feel
a
little
tired
but
i
reflected
i
had
not
come
down
here
in
this
weather
and
among
these
new
surroundings
to
be
depressed
so
i
began
to
whistle
and
it
was
just
then
that
i
was
aware
of
a
little
grey
shadow
as
it
might
have
been
a
snowflake
seen
against
the
light
floating
at
an
immense
distance
in
the
background
of
my
brain
it
annoyed
me
and
i
shook
my
head
to
get
rid
of
it
then
my
brain
telegraphed
that
it
was
the
forerunner
of
a
gloom
which
there
was
yet
time
to
escape
if
i
would
force
my
thoughts
away
from
it
as
a
man
leaping
for
life
forces
his
body
forward
and
away
from
the
fall
of
a
wall
but
the
gloom
overtook
me
before
i
could
take
in
the
meaning
of
the
message
i
moved
toward
the
bed
every
nerve
already
aching
with
the
foreknowledge
of
the
pain
that
was
to
be
dealt
it
and
sat
down
while
my
amazed
and
angry
soul
dropped
gulf
by
gulf
into
that
horror
of
great
darkness
which
is
spoken
of
in
the
bible
and
which
as
auctioneers
say
must
be
experienced
to
be
appreciated
despair
upon
despair
misery
upon
misery
fear
after
fear
each
causing
their
distinct
and
separate
woe
packed
in
upon
me
for
an
unrecorded
length
of
time
until
at
last
they
blurred
together
and
i
heard
a
click
in
my
brain
like
the
click
in
the
ear
when
one
descends
in
a
diving
bell
and
i
knew
that
the
pressures
were
equalised
within
and
without
and
that
for
the
moment
the
worst
was
at
an
end
but
i
knew
also
that
at
any
moment
the
darkness
might
come
down
anew
and
while
i
dwelt
on
this
speculation
precisely
as
a
man
torments
a
raging
tooth
with
his
tongue
it
ebbed
away
into
the
little
grey
shadow
on
the
brain
of
its
first
coming
and
once
more
i
heard
my
brain
which
knew
what
would
recur
telegraph
to
every
quarter
fox
help
release
or
diversion
the
door
opened
and
reappeared
i
thanked
him
politely
saying
i
was
charmed
with
my
room
anxious
to
meet
much
refreshed
with
my
wash
and
so
on
and
so
forth
beyond
a
little
stickiness
at
the
corners
of
my
mouth
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
managing
my
words
admirably
the
while
that
i
myself
cowered
at
the
bottom
of
unclimbable
pits
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
you
got
it
now
already
ai
it
yes
i
answered
it
making
me
sick
it
will
pass
off
when
you
come
outside
i
give
you
my
word
it
will
then
pass
off
come
i
shambled
out
behind
him
and
wiped
my
forehead
in
the
hall
you
mus
mind
he
said
i
expect
the
run
tired
you
my
good
lady
is
sitting
there
under
the
copper
she
was
a
fat
woman
in
an
gown
with
a
heavily
powdered
face
against
which
her
black
eyes
showed
like
currants
in
dough
i
was
introduced
to
many
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
those
parts
magnificently
appointed
landaus
and
covered
motors
swept
in
and
out
of
the
drive
and
the
air
was
gay
with
the
merry
outcries
of
the
tennis
players
as
twilight
drew
on
they
all
went
away
and
i
was
left
alone
with
and
while
tall
menservants
and
maidservants
took
away
the
tennis
and
tea
things
miss
had
walked
a
little
down
the
drive
with
a
young
man
who
apparently
knew
everything
about
every
south
american
railway
stock
he
had
told
me
at
tea
that
these
were
the
days
of
financial
specialisation
i
think
it
went
off
beautifully
my
dear
said
to
his
wife
and
to
me
you
feel
all
right
now
ai
it
of
course
you
surged
across
the
gravel
her
husband
skipped
nimbly
before
her
into
the
south
verandah
turned
a
switch
and
all
holmescroft
was
flooded
with
light
you
can
do
that
from
your
room
also
he
said
as
they
went
in
there
is
something
in
money
ai
it
miss
came
up
behind
me
in
the
dusk
we
have
not
yet
been
introduced
she
said
but
i
suppose
you
are
staying
the
night
your
father
was
kind
enough
to
ask
me
i
replied
she
nodded
yes
i
know
and
you
know
too
do
you
i
saw
your
face
when
you
came
to
shake
hands
with
mamma
you
felt
the
depression
very
soon
it
is
simply
frightful
in
that
bedroom
sometimes
what
do
you
think
it
is
bewitchment
in
greece
where
i
was
a
little
girl
it
might
have
been
but
not
in
england
do
you
think
or
do
you
cheer
up
thea
it
will
all
come
right
he
insisted
no
she
shook
her
dark
head
nothing
is
right
while
it
it
is
nothing
that
we
ourselves
have
ever
done
in
our
lives
that
i
will
swear
to
you
said
suddenly
and
we
have
changed
our
servants
several
times
so
we
know
it
is
not
never
mind
let
us
enjoy
ourselves
while
we
can
said
opening
the
champagne
but
we
did
not
enjoy
ourselves
the
talk
failed
there
were
long
silences
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
for
i
thought
some
one
at
my
elbow
was
about
to
speak
ah
that
is
the
other
thing
said
miss
her
mother
groaned
we
were
silent
again
and
in
a
few
seconds
it
must
have
been
a
live
grief
beyond
words
not
ghostly
dread
or
horror
but
aching
helpless
grief
overwhelmed
us
each
i
felt
according
to
his
or
her
nature
and
held
steady
like
the
beam
of
a
burning
glass
behind
that
pain
i
was
conscious
there
was
a
desire
on
somebody
part
to
explain
something
on
which
some
tremendously
important
issue
hung
meantime
i
rolled
bread
pills
and
remembered
my
sins
considered
his
own
reflection
in
a
spoon
his
wife
seemed
to
be
praying
and
the
girl
fidgetted
desperately
with
hands
and
feet
till
the
darkness
passed
on
as
though
the
malignant
rays
of
a
had
been
shifted
from
us
there
said
miss
half
rising
now
you
see
what
makes
a
happy
home
oh
sell
it
sell
it
father
mine
and
let
us
go
away
but
i
spent
thousands
on
it
you
shall
go
to
harrogate
next
week
thea
i
only
just
back
from
hotels
i
am
so
tired
of
cheer
up
thea
it
is
over
you
know
it
does
not
often
come
here
twice
in
the
same
night
i
think
we
shall
dare
now
to
be
he
lifted
a
and
helped
his
wife
and
daughter
his
face
was
lined
and
fallen
like
an
old
man
after
debauch
but
his
hand
did
not
shake
and
his
voice
was
clear
as
he
worked
to
restore
us
by
speech
and
action
he
reminded
me
of
a
collie
herding
demoralised
sheep
after
dinner
we
sat
round
the
fire
the
might
have
been
under
the
shadow
for
aught
we
knew
talking
with
the
intimacy
of
gipsies
by
the
wayside
or
of
wounded
comparing
notes
after
a
skirmish
by
eleven
the
three
between
them
had
given
me
every
name
and
detail
they
could
recall
that
in
any
way
bore
on
the
house
and
what
they
knew
of
its
history
we
went
to
bed
in
a
fortifying
blaze
of
electric
light
my
one
fear
was
that
the
blasting
gust
of
depression
would
return
the
surest
way
of
course
to
bring
it
i
lay
awake
till
dawn
breathing
quickly
and
sweating
lightly
beneath
what
de
quincey
inadequately
describes
as
the
oppression
of
inexpiable
now
as
soon
as
the
lovely
day
was
broken
i
fell
into
the
most
terrible
of
all
dreams
that
joyous
one
in
which
all
past
evil
has
not
only
been
wiped
out
of
our
lives
but
has
never
been
committed
and
in
the
very
bliss
of
our
assured
innocence
before
our
loves
shriek
and
change
countenance
we
wake
to
the
day
we
have
earned
it
was
a
coolish
morning
but
we
preferred
to
breakfast
in
the
south
verandah
the
forenoon
we
spent
in
the
garden
pretending
to
play
games
that
come
out
of
boxes
such
as
croquet
and
clock
golf
but
most
of
the
time
we
drew
together
and
talked
the
young
man
who
knew
all
about
south
american
railways
took
miss
for
a
walk
in
the
afternoon
and
at
five
thoughtfully
whirled
us
all
up
to
dine
in
town
now
do
say
you
will
tell
the
psychological
society
and
that
you
will
come
again
said
miss
as
we
parted
because
i
know
you
will
you
should
not
say
that
said
her
mother
you
should
say
perseus
come
again
not
him
the
girl
cried
he
has
seen
the
medusa
head
looking
at
myself
in
the
restaurant
mirrors
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
not
much
benefited
by
my
next
morning
i
wrote
out
all
my
holmescroft
notes
at
fullest
length
in
the
hope
that
by
so
doing
i
could
put
it
all
behind
me
but
the
experience
worked
on
my
mind
as
they
say
certain
imperfectly
understood
rays
work
on
the
body
i
am
less
calculated
to
make
a
sherlock
holmes
than
any
man
i
know
for
i
lack
both
method
and
patience
yet
the
idea
of
following
up
the
trouble
to
its
source
fascinated
me
i
had
no
theory
to
go
on
except
a
vague
idea
that
i
had
come
between
two
poles
of
a
discharge
and
had
taken
a
shock
meant
for
some
one
else
this
was
followed
by
a
feeling
of
intense
irritation
i
waited
cautiously
on
myself
expecting
to
be
overtaken
by
horror
of
the
supernatural
but
my
self
persisted
in
being
humanly
indignant
exactly
as
though
it
had
been
the
victim
of
a
practical
joke
it
was
in
great
pains
and
upheavals
that
i
felt
in
every
fibre
but
its
dominant
idea
to
put
it
coarsely
was
to
get
back
a
bit
of
its
own
by
this
i
knew
that
i
might
go
forward
if
i
could
find
the
way
after
a
few
days
it
occurred
to
me
to
go
to
the
office
of
baxter
the
solicitor
who
had
sold
holmescroft
to
i
explained
i
had
some
notion
of
buying
the
place
would
he
act
for
me
in
the
matter
baxter
a
large
greyish
man
showed
no
enthusiasm
i
sold
it
to
he
said
it
scarcely
do
for
me
to
start
on
the
tack
now
but
i
can
recommend
i
know
he
asking
an
awful
price
i
interrupted
and
atop
of
it
he
wants
an
extra
thousand
for
what
he
calls
your
clean
bill
of
baxter
sat
up
in
his
chair
i
had
all
his
attention
your
guarantee
with
the
house
do
you
remember
it
yes
yes
that
no
death
had
taken
place
in
the
house
since
it
was
built
i
remember
he
did
not
gulp
as
untrained
men
do
when
they
lie
but
his
jaws
moved
stickily
and
his
eyes
turning
towards
the
deed
boxes
on
the
wall
dulled
i
counted
seconds
one
two
three
one
two
three
up
to
ten
a
man
i
knew
can
live
through
ages
of
mental
depression
in
that
time
i
remember
his
mouth
opened
a
little
as
though
it
had
tasted
old
bitterness
of
course
that
sort
of
thing
does
appeal
to
i
went
on
i
expect
to
buy
a
house
free
from
certainly
not
no
one
does
but
it
was
fancy
his
rather
i
believe
and
since
we
could
meet
it
it
was
my
duty
to
my
clients
at
whatever
cost
to
my
own
feelings
to
make
him
that
really
why
i
came
to
you
i
understood
from
him
you
knew
the
place
oh
yes
always
did
it
originally
belonged
to
some
connections
of
the
misses
moultrie
i
suppose
how
interesting
they
must
have
loved
the
place
before
the
country
round
about
was
built
they
were
very
fond
of
it
i
do
wonder
so
restful
and
sunny
i
do
see
how
they
could
have
brought
themselves
to
part
with
now
it
is
one
of
the
most
constant
peculiarities
of
the
english
that
in
polite
conversation
and
i
had
striven
to
be
polite
no
one
ever
does
or
sells
anything
for
mere
money
sake
miss
agnes
the
youngest
fell
ill
he
spaced
his
words
a
little
and
as
they
were
very
much
attached
to
each
other
that
broke
up
the
naturally
i
fancied
it
must
have
been
something
of
that
kind
one
does
associate
the
staffordshire
moultries
my
demon
of
irresponsibility
at
that
instant
created
with
with
being
hard
i
do
know
whether
we
related
to
them
he
answered
importantly
we
may
be
for
our
branch
of
the
family
comes
from
the
i
give
this
talk
at
length
because
i
am
so
proud
of
my
first
attempt
at
detective
work
when
i
left
him
twenty
minutes
later
with
instructions
to
move
against
the
owner
of
holmescroft
with
a
view
to
purchase
i
was
more
bewildered
than
any
doctor
watson
at
the
opening
of
a
story
why
should
a
solicitor
turn
plovers
egg
colour
and
drop
his
jaw
when
reminded
of
so
innocent
and
festal
a
matter
as
that
no
death
had
ever
occurred
in
a
house
that
he
had
sold
if
i
knew
my
english
vocabulary
at
all
the
tone
in
which
he
said
the
youngest
sister
fell
ill
meant
that
she
had
gone
out
of
her
mind
that
might
explain
his
change
of
countenance
and
it
was
just
possible
that
her
demented
influence
still
hung
about
holmescroft
but
the
rest
was
beyond
me
i
was
relieved
when
i
reached
city
office
and
could
tell
him
what
i
had
done
not
what
i
thought
was
quite
willing
to
enter
into
the
game
of
the
pretended
purchase
but
did
not
see
how
it
would
help
if
i
knew
baxter
he
the
only
living
soul
i
can
get
at
who
was
connected
with
holmescroft
i
said
ah
living
soul
is
good
said
at
any
rate
our
little
girl
will
be
pleased
that
you
are
still
interested
in
us
wo
you
come
down
some
day
this
week
how
is
it
there
now
i
asked
he
screwed
up
his
face
simply
frightful
he
said
thea
is
at
i
should
like
it
immensely
but
i
must
cultivate
baxter
for
the
present
you
be
sure
and
keep
him
busy
your
end
wo
you
he
looked
at
me
with
quiet
contempt
do
not
be
afraid
i
shall
be
a
good
jew
i
shall
be
my
own
before
a
fortnight
was
over
baxter
admitted
ruefully
that
was
better
than
most
firms
in
the
business
we
buyers
were
coy
argumentative
shocked
at
the
price
of
holmescroft
inquisitive
and
cold
by
turns
but
the
seller
easily
met
and
surpassed
us
and
baxter
entered
every
letter
telegram
and
consultation
at
the
proper
rates
in
a
of
a
bill
at
the
end
of
a
month
he
said
it
looked
as
though
thanks
to
him
were
really
going
to
listen
to
reason
i
was
many
pounds
out
of
pocket
but
i
had
learned
something
of
baxter
on
the
human
side
i
deserved
it
never
in
my
life
have
i
worked
to
conciliate
amuse
and
flatter
a
human
being
as
i
worked
over
my
solicitor
it
appeared
that
he
golfed
therefore
i
was
an
enthusiastic
beginner
anxious
to
learn
twice
i
invaded
his
office
with
a
bag
lent
it
full
of
the
spelicans
needed
in
this
detestable
game
and
a
vocabulary
to
match
the
third
time
the
ice
broke
and
baxter
took
me
to
his
links
quite
ten
miles
off
where
in
a
maze
of
tramway
lines
railroads
and
we
skelped
our
divotted
way
round
nine
holes
like
barges
plunging
through
head
seas
he
played
vilely
and
had
never
expected
to
meet
any
one
worse
but
as
he
realised
my
form
i
think
he
began
to
like
me
for
he
took
me
in
hand
by
the
two
hours
together
after
a
fortnight
he
could
give
me
no
more
than
a
stroke
a
hole
and
when
with
this
allowance
i
once
managed
to
beat
him
by
one
he
was
honestly
glad
and
assured
me
that
i
should
be
a
golfer
if
i
stuck
to
it
i
was
sticking
to
it
for
my
own
ends
but
now
and
again
my
conscience
pricked
me
for
the
man
was
a
nice
man
between
games
he
supplied
me
with
odd
pieces
of
evidence
such
as
that
he
had
known
the
moultries
all
his
life
being
their
cousin
and
that
miss
mary
the
eldest
was
an
unforgiving
woman
who
would
never
let
bygones
be
i
naturally
wondered
what
she
might
have
against
him
and
somehow
connected
him
unfavourably
with
mad
agnes
people
ought
to
forgive
and
forget
he
volunteered
one
day
between
rounds
specially
where
in
the
nature
of
things
they
ca
be
sure
of
their
deductions
do
you
think
so
it
all
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
evidence
on
which
one
forms
judgment
i
answered
nonsense
he
cried
i
lawyer
enough
to
know
that
there
nothing
in
the
world
so
misleading
as
circumstantial
evidence
never
why
have
you
ever
seen
men
hanged
on
it
hanged
people
have
been
supposed
to
be
eternally
lost
on
it
his
face
turned
grey
again
i
do
know
how
it
is
with
you
but
my
consolation
is
that
god
must
know
he
must
things
that
seem
on
the
face
of
like
murder
or
say
suicide
may
appear
different
to
god
heh
that
what
the
murderer
and
the
suicide
can
always
hope
i
i
have
expressed
myself
clumsily
as
usual
the
facts
as
god
knows
may
be
different
even
after
the
most
clinching
evidence
always
said
that
both
as
a
lawyer
and
a
man
but
some
people
wo
i
do
want
to
judge
we
say
they
ca
believe
it
whereas
i
say
there
always
a
working
chance
a
certainty
that
the
worst
he
stopped
and
cleared
his
throat
now
let
come
on
this
time
next
week
i
shall
be
taking
my
what
links
i
asked
carelessly
while
twins
in
a
perambulator
got
out
of
our
line
of
fire
a
potty
little
affair
at
a
hydro
in
the
midlands
my
cousins
stay
there
always
will
not
but
what
the
fourth
and
the
seventh
holes
take
some
doing
you
could
manage
it
though
he
said
encouragingly
you
doing
much
better
it
only
your
approach
shots
that
are
you
right
i
ca
approach
for
nuts
i
shall
go
to
pieces
while
you
away
with
no
one
to
coach
me
i
said
mournfully
i
have
taught
you
anything
he
said
delighted
with
the
compliment
i
owe
all
i
learned
to
you
anyhow
when
will
you
come
back
look
here
he
began
i
do
know
your
engagements
but
i
no
one
to
play
with
at
burry
mills
never
have
why
could
you
take
a
few
days
off
and
join
me
there
i
warn
you
it
will
be
rather
dull
it
a
throat
and
gout
massage
electricity
and
so
forth
but
the
fourth
and
the
seventh
holes
really
take
some
i
for
the
game
i
answered
valiantly
heaven
well
knowing
that
i
hated
every
stroke
and
word
of
it
that
the
proper
spirit
as
their
lawyer
i
must
ask
you
not
to
say
anything
to
my
cousins
about
holmescroft
it
upsets
always
did
but
speaking
as
man
to
man
it
would
be
very
pleasant
for
me
if
you
could
see
your
way
to
i
saw
it
as
soon
as
decency
permitted
and
thanked
him
sincerely
according
to
my
now
theory
he
had
certainly
misappropriated
his
aged
cousins
monies
under
power
of
attorney
and
had
probably
driven
poor
agnes
moultrie
out
of
her
wits
but
i
wished
that
he
was
not
so
gentle
and
and
innocent
eyed
before
i
joined
him
at
burry
mills
hydro
i
spent
a
night
at
holmescroft
miss
had
returned
from
her
hydro
and
first
we
made
very
merry
on
the
open
lawn
in
the
sunshine
over
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
english
resorting
to
such
places
she
knew
dozens
of
hydros
and
warned
me
how
to
behave
in
them
while
and
stood
aside
and
adored
her
ah
that
the
way
she
always
comes
back
to
us
he
said
pity
it
wears
off
so
soon
ai
it
you
ought
to
hear
her
sing
mirth
thou
pretty
bird
we
had
the
house
to
face
through
the
evening
and
there
we
neither
laughed
nor
sung
the
gloom
fell
on
us
as
we
entered
and
did
not
shift
till
ten
when
we
crawled
out
as
it
were
from
beneath
it
it
has
been
bad
this
summer
said
in
a
whisper
after
we
realised
that
we
were
freed
sometimes
i
think
the
house
will
get
up
and
cry
out
it
is
so
how
have
you
forgotten
what
comes
after
the
depression
so
then
we
waited
about
the
small
fire
and
the
dead
air
in
the
room
presently
filled
and
pressed
down
upon
us
with
the
sensation
but
words
are
useless
here
as
though
some
dumb
and
bound
power
were
striving
against
gag
and
bond
to
deliver
its
soul
of
an
articulate
word
it
passed
in
a
few
minutes
and
i
fell
to
thinking
about
conscience
and
agnes
moultrie
gone
mad
in
the
bedroom
that
waited
me
these
reflections
secured
me
a
night
during
which
i
rediscovered
how
from
purely
mental
causes
a
man
can
be
physically
sick
but
the
sickness
was
bliss
compared
to
my
dreams
when
the
birds
waked
on
my
departure
gave
me
a
beautiful
narwhal
horn
much
as
a
nurse
gives
a
child
sweets
for
being
brave
at
a
dentist
there
no
duplicate
of
it
in
the
world
he
said
else
it
would
have
come
to
old
max
and
he
tucked
it
into
the
motor
miss
on
the
far
side
of
the
car
whispered
have
you
found
out
anything
perseus
i
shook
my
head
then
i
shall
be
chained
to
my
rock
all
my
life
she
went
on
only
do
tell
i
supposed
she
was
thinking
of
the
young
gentleman
who
specialised
in
south
american
rails
for
i
noticed
a
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
her
left
hand
i
went
straight
from
that
house
to
burry
mills
hydro
keen
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
on
playing
golf
which
is
guaranteed
to
occupy
the
mind
baxter
had
taken
me
a
room
communicating
with
his
own
and
after
lunch
introduced
me
to
a
tall
elderly
lady
of
decided
manners
whom
a
maid
pushed
along
in
a
through
the
grounds
of
the
hydro
she
was
miss
mary
moultrie
and
she
coughed
and
cleared
her
throat
just
like
baxter
she
suffered
she
told
me
it
was
a
moultrie
castemark
from
some
obscure
form
of
chronic
bronchitis
complicated
with
spasm
of
the
glottis
and
in
a
dead
flat
voice
with
a
sunken
eye
that
looked
and
saw
not
told
me
what
washes
gargles
pastilles
and
inhalations
she
had
proved
most
beneficial
from
her
i
was
passed
on
to
her
younger
sister
miss
elizabeth
a
small
and
withered
thing
with
twitching
lips
victim
she
told
me
to
very
much
the
same
sort
of
throat
but
secretly
devoted
to
another
set
of
medicines
when
she
went
away
with
baxter
and
the
i
fell
across
a
major
of
the
indian
army
with
gout
in
his
glassy
eyes
and
a
stomach
which
he
had
taken
all
round
the
continent
he
laid
everything
before
me
and
him
i
escaped
only
to
be
confided
in
by
a
matron
with
a
tendency
to
follicular
tonsilitis
and
eczema
baxter
waited
hand
and
foot
on
his
cousins
till
five
trying
as
i
saw
to
atone
for
his
treatment
of
the
dead
sister
miss
mary
ordered
him
about
like
a
dog
i
warned
you
it
would
be
dull
he
said
when
we
met
in
the
it
tremendously
interesting
i
said
but
how
about
a
look
round
the
links
unluckily
damp
always
affects
my
eldest
cousin
i
got
to
buy
her
a
new
arthurs
broke
her
old
one
we
slipped
out
to
the
chemist
shop
in
the
town
and
he
bought
a
large
glittering
tin
thing
whose
workings
he
explained
i
used
to
this
sort
of
work
i
come
up
here
pretty
often
he
said
i
the
family
throat
you
a
good
man
i
said
a
very
good
he
turned
towards
me
in
the
evening
light
among
the
beeches
and
his
face
was
changed
to
what
it
might
have
been
a
generation
before
you
see
he
said
huskily
there
was
the
youngest
agnes
before
she
fell
ill
you
know
but
she
did
like
leaving
her
sisters
never
he
hurried
on
with
his
load
and
left
me
among
the
ruins
of
my
black
theories
the
man
with
that
face
had
done
agnes
moultrie
no
wrong
we
never
played
our
game
i
was
waked
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
from
my
hygienic
bed
by
baxter
in
an
ulster
over
orange
and
white
pyjamas
which
i
should
never
have
suspected
from
his
character
my
cousin
has
had
some
sort
of
a
seizure
he
said
will
you
come
i
do
want
to
wake
the
doctor
do
want
to
make
a
scandal
quick
so
i
came
quickly
and
led
by
the
arthurs
in
a
jacket
and
petticoat
entered
a
room
reeking
with
steam
and
balsam
the
electrics
were
all
on
miss
mary
i
knew
her
by
her
height
was
at
the
open
window
wrestling
with
miss
elizabeth
who
gripped
her
round
the
knees
miss
mary
hand
was
at
her
own
throat
which
was
streaked
with
blood
she
done
it
she
done
it
too
miss
elizabeth
panted
hold
her
help
me
oh
i
say
women
do
cut
their
throats
baxter
whispered
my
god
has
she
cut
her
throat
the
maid
cried
out
and
with
no
warning
rolled
over
in
a
faint
baxter
pushed
her
under
the
and
leaped
to
hold
the
gaunt
woman
who
crowed
and
whistled
as
she
struggled
toward
the
window
he
took
her
by
the
shoulder
and
she
struck
out
wildly
all
right
she
only
cut
her
hand
he
said
wet
towel
quick
while
i
got
that
he
pushed
her
backward
her
strength
seemed
almost
as
great
as
his
i
swabbed
at
her
throat
when
i
could
and
found
no
mark
then
helped
him
to
control
her
a
little
miss
elizabeth
leaped
back
to
bed
wailing
like
a
child
tie
up
her
hand
somehow
said
baxter
do
let
it
drip
about
the
place
she
he
stepped
on
broken
glass
in
his
slippers
she
must
have
smashed
a
miss
mary
lurched
towards
the
open
window
again
dropped
on
her
knees
her
head
on
the
sill
and
lay
quiet
surrendering
the
cut
hand
to
me
what
did
she
do
baxter
turned
towards
miss
elizabeth
in
the
far
bed
she
was
going
to
throw
herself
out
of
the
window
was
the
answer
i
stopped
her
and
sent
arthurs
for
you
oh
we
can
never
hold
up
our
heads
again
miss
mary
writhed
and
fought
for
breath
baxter
found
a
shawl
which
he
threw
over
her
shoulders
nonsense
said
he
that
is
like
mary
but
his
face
worked
when
he
said
it
you
would
believe
about
aggie
john
perhaps
you
will
now
said
miss
elizabeth
i
saw
her
do
it
and
she
cut
her
throat
too
she
has
i
said
it
only
her
miss
mary
suddenly
broke
from
us
with
an
indescribable
grunt
flew
rather
than
ran
to
her
sister
bed
and
there
shook
her
as
one
furious
schoolgirl
would
shake
another
no
such
thing
she
croaked
how
dare
you
think
so
you
wicked
little
fool
get
into
bed
mary
said
baxter
you
catch
a
she
obeyed
but
sat
up
with
the
grey
shawl
round
her
lean
shoulders
glaring
at
her
sister
i
better
now
she
panted
arthurs
let
me
sit
out
too
long
where
arthurs
the
never
mind
arthurs
said
baxter
you
get
the
i
hastened
to
bring
it
from
the
side
table
now
mary
as
god
sees
you
tell
me
what
you
his
lips
were
dry
and
he
could
not
moisten
them
with
his
tongue
miss
mary
applied
herself
to
the
mouth
of
the
kettle
and
between
indraws
of
steam
said
the
spasm
came
on
just
now
while
i
was
asleep
i
was
nearly
choking
to
death
so
i
went
to
the
window
i
done
it
often
before
without
waking
any
one
bessie
such
an
old
maid
about
draughts
i
tell
you
i
was
choking
to
death
i
could
manage
the
catch
and
i
nearly
fell
out
that
window
opens
too
low
i
cut
my
hand
trying
to
save
myself
who
has
tied
it
up
in
this
filthy
handkerchief
i
wish
you
had
had
my
throat
bessie
i
never
was
nearer
dying
she
scowled
on
us
all
impartially
while
her
sister
sobbed
from
the
bottom
of
the
bed
we
heard
a
quivering
voice
is
she
dead
have
they
took
her
away
oh
i
never
could
bear
the
sight
o
blood
arthurs
said
miss
mary
you
are
an
hireling
go
away
it
is
my
belief
that
arthurs
crawled
out
on
all
fours
but
i
was
busy
picking
up
broken
glass
from
the
carpet
then
baxter
seated
by
the
side
of
the
bed
began
to
in
a
voice
i
scarcely
recognised
no
one
could
for
an
instant
have
doubted
the
genuine
rage
of
miss
mary
against
her
sister
her
cousin
or
her
maid
and
that
a
doctor
should
have
been
called
in
for
she
did
me
the
honour
of
calling
me
doctor
was
the
last
drop
she
was
choking
with
her
throat
had
rushed
to
the
window
for
air
had
near
pitched
out
and
in
catching
at
the
window
bars
had
cut
her
hand
over
and
over
she
made
this
clear
to
the
intent
baxter
then
she
turned
on
her
sister
and
her
savagely
you
must
blame
me
miss
bessie
faltered
at
last
you
know
what
we
think
of
night
and
i
coming
to
that
said
baxter
listen
to
me
what
you
did
mary
misled
four
people
into
thinking
you
you
meant
to
do
away
with
is
one
suicide
in
the
family
enough
oh
god
help
and
pity
us
you
could
have
believed
that
she
cried
the
evidence
was
complete
now
do
you
think
baxter
finger
wagged
under
her
nose
ca
you
think
that
poor
aggie
did
the
same
thing
at
holmescroft
when
she
fell
out
of
the
window
she
had
the
same
throat
said
miss
elizabeth
exactly
the
same
symptoms
do
you
remember
mary
which
was
her
bedroom
i
asked
of
baxter
in
an
undertone
over
the
south
verandah
looking
on
to
the
tennis
i
nearly
fell
out
of
that
very
window
when
i
was
at
holmescroft
opening
it
to
get
some
air
the
sill
does
come
much
above
your
knees
i
said
you
hear
that
mary
mary
do
you
hear
what
this
gentleman
says
you
believe
that
what
nearly
happened
to
you
must
have
happened
to
poor
aggie
that
night
for
god
sake
for
her
sake
mary
wo
you
believe
there
was
a
long
silence
while
the
steam
kettle
puffed
if
i
could
have
proof
if
i
could
have
proof
said
she
and
broke
into
most
horrible
tears
baxter
motioned
to
me
and
i
crept
away
to
my
room
and
lay
awake
till
morning
thinking
more
specially
of
the
dumb
thing
at
holmescroft
which
wished
to
explain
itself
i
hated
miss
mary
as
perfectly
as
though
i
had
known
her
for
twenty
years
but
i
felt
that
alive
or
dead
i
should
not
like
her
to
condemn
me
yet
at
when
i
saw
miss
mary
in
her
bathchair
arthurs
behind
and
baxter
and
miss
elizabeth
on
either
side
in
the
grounds
of
the
hydro
i
found
it
difficult
to
arrange
my
words
now
that
you
know
all
about
it
said
baxter
aside
after
the
first
strangeness
of
our
meeting
was
over
it
only
fair
to
tell
you
that
my
poor
cousin
did
not
die
in
holmescroft
at
all
she
was
dead
when
they
found
her
under
the
window
in
the
morning
just
under
that
laburnum
outside
the
window
i
asked
for
i
suddenly
remembered
the
crooked
evil
thing
exactly
she
broke
the
tree
in
falling
but
no
death
has
ever
taken
place
in
the
house
so
far
as
we
were
concerned
you
can
make
yourself
quite
easy
on
that
point
extra
thousand
for
what
you
called
the
bill
of
health
was
something
toward
my
estate
when
we
sold
it
was
my
duty
as
their
lawyer
to
get
it
for
them
at
any
cost
to
my
own
i
know
better
than
to
argue
when
the
english
talk
about
their
duty
so
i
agreed
with
my
solicitor
their
sister
death
must
have
been
a
great
blow
to
your
cousins
i
went
on
the
was
behind
me
unspeakable
baxter
whispered
they
brooded
on
it
day
and
night
no
wonder
if
their
theory
of
poor
aggie
making
away
with
herself
was
correct
she
was
eternally
lost
do
you
believe
that
she
made
away
with
herself
no
thank
god
never
have
and
after
what
happened
to
mary
last
night
i
see
perfectly
what
happened
to
poor
aggie
she
had
the
family
throat
too
by
the
way
mary
thinks
you
are
a
doctor
otherwise
she
like
your
having
been
in
her
very
good
is
she
convinced
now
about
her
sister
death
she
give
anything
to
be
able
to
believe
it
but
she
a
hard
woman
and
brooding
along
certain
lines
makes
one
groovy
i
have
sometimes
been
afraid
of
her
reason
on
the
religious
side
do
you
know
elizabeth
does
matter
brain
of
a
hen
always
here
arthurs
summoned
me
to
the
and
the
ravaged
face
beneath
its
knitted
shetland
wool
hood
of
miss
mary
moultrie
i
need
not
remind
you
i
hope
of
the
seal
of
secrecy
absolute
secrecy
in
your
profession
she
began
thanks
to
my
cousin
and
my
sister
stupidity
you
have
found
out
she
blew
her
nose
please
do
excite
her
sir
said
arthurs
at
the
back
but
my
dear
miss
moultrie
i
only
know
what
i
seen
of
course
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
thought
was
a
tragedy
in
your
case
turns
out
on
your
own
evidence
so
to
speak
to
have
been
an
accident
a
dreadfully
sad
one
but
absolutely
an
do
you
believe
that
too
she
cried
or
are
you
only
saying
it
to
comfort
me
i
believe
it
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
come
down
to
holmescroft
for
an
hour
for
half
an
hour
and
satisfy
of
what
you
do
understand
i
see
the
house
every
night
i
am
always
there
in
spirit
waking
or
sleeping
i
could
face
it
in
but
you
must
i
said
if
you
go
there
in
the
spirit
the
greater
need
for
you
to
go
there
in
the
flesh
go
to
your
sister
room
once
more
and
see
the
window
i
nearly
fell
out
of
it
myself
it
it
awfully
low
and
dangerous
that
would
convince
you
i
pleaded
yet
aggie
had
slept
in
that
room
for
years
she
interrupted
you
slept
in
your
room
here
for
a
long
time
have
you
but
you
nearly
fell
out
of
the
window
when
you
were
that
is
true
that
is
one
thing
true
she
nodded
and
i
might
have
been
killed
as
perhaps
aggie
was
in
that
case
your
own
sister
and
cousin
and
maid
would
have
said
you
had
committed
suicide
miss
moultrie
come
down
to
holmescroft
and
go
over
the
place
just
you
are
lying
she
said
quite
quietly
you
do
want
me
to
come
down
to
see
a
window
it
is
something
else
i
warn
you
we
are
evangelicals
we
do
believe
in
prayers
for
the
dead
the
tree
falls
yes
i
daresay
but
you
persist
in
thinking
that
your
sister
committed
suicide
no
no
i
have
always
prayed
that
i
might
have
misjudged
arthurs
at
the
spoke
up
oh
miss
mary
you
would
it
from
the
first
that
poor
miss
aggie
made
away
with
herself
an
of
course
miss
bessie
took
the
notion
from
you
only
master
mister
john
stood
out
and
and
i
taken
my
bible
oath
you
was
making
away
with
yourself
last
miss
mary
leaned
towards
me
one
finger
on
my
sleeve
if
going
to
holmescroft
kills
me
she
said
you
will
have
the
murder
of
a
on
your
conscience
for
all
i
risk
it
i
answered
remembering
what
torment
the
mere
reflection
of
her
torments
had
cast
on
holmescroft
and
remembering
above
all
the
dumb
thing
that
filled
the
house
with
its
desire
to
speak
i
felt
that
there
might
be
worse
things
baxter
was
amazed
at
the
proposed
visit
but
at
a
nod
from
that
terrible
woman
went
off
to
make
arrangements
then
i
sent
a
telegram
to
bidding
him
and
his
vacate
holmescroft
for
that
afternoon
miss
mary
should
be
alone
with
her
dead
as
i
had
been
alone
i
expected
untold
trouble
in
transporting
her
but
to
do
her
justice
the
promise
given
for
the
journey
she
underwent
it
without
murmur
spasm
or
unnecessary
word
miss
bessie
pressed
in
a
corner
by
the
window
wept
behind
her
veil
and
from
time
to
time
tried
to
take
hold
of
her
sister
hand
baxter
wrapped
himself
in
his
newly
found
happiness
as
selfishly
as
a
bridegroom
for
he
sat
still
and
smiled
so
long
as
i
know
that
aggie
did
make
away
with
herself
he
explained
i
tell
you
frankly
i
do
care
what
happened
she
as
hard
as
a
rock
mary
always
was
she
wo
we
led
her
out
on
to
the
platform
like
a
blind
woman
and
so
got
her
into
the
fly
the
crawl
to
holmescroft
was
the
most
racking
experience
of
the
day
had
obeyed
my
instructions
there
was
no
one
visible
in
the
house
or
the
gardens
and
the
front
door
stood
open
miss
mary
rose
from
beside
her
sister
stepped
forth
first
and
entered
the
hall
come
bessie
she
cried
i
dare
oh
i
come
her
voice
had
altered
i
felt
baxter
start
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
good
heavens
said
baxter
she
running
up
the
stairs
we
better
let
wait
below
she
going
to
the
we
heard
the
door
of
the
bedroom
i
knew
open
and
shut
and
we
waited
in
the
hall
heavy
with
the
scent
of
flowers
i
never
been
into
it
since
it
was
sold
baxter
sighed
what
a
lovely
restful
plate
it
is
poor
aggie
used
to
arrange
the
restful
i
began
but
stopped
of
a
sudden
for
i
felt
all
over
my
bruised
soul
that
baxter
was
speaking
truth
it
was
a
light
spacious
airy
house
full
of
the
sense
of
and
peace
above
all
things
of
peace
i
ventured
into
the
where
the
thoughtful
had
left
a
small
fire
there
was
no
terror
there
present
or
lurking
and
in
the
which
for
good
reasons
we
had
never
cared
to
enter
the
sun
and
the
peace
and
the
scent
of
the
flowers
worked
together
as
is
fit
in
an
inhabited
house
when
i
returned
to
the
hall
baxter
was
sweetly
asleep
on
a
couch
looking
most
unlike
a
solicitor
who
had
spent
a
broken
night
with
an
exacting
cousin
there
was
ample
time
for
me
to
review
it
all
to
felicitate
myself
upon
my
magnificent
acumen
barring
some
errors
about
baxter
as
a
thief
and
possibly
a
murderer
before
the
door
above
opened
and
baxter
evidently
a
light
sleeper
sprang
awake
i
had
a
heavenly
little
nap
he
said
rubbing
his
eyes
with
the
backs
of
his
hands
like
a
child
good
lord
that
not
their
step
but
it
was
i
had
never
before
been
privileged
to
see
the
shadow
turned
backward
on
the
dial
the
years
ripped
bodily
off
poor
human
shoulders
old
sunken
eyes
filled
and
alight
harsh
lips
moistened
and
human
john
miss
mary
called
i
know
now
aggie
did
do
it
and
she
did
do
it
echoed
miss
mary
i
did
not
think
it
wrong
to
say
a
prayer
miss
mary
continued
not
for
her
soul
but
for
our
peace
then
i
was
then
we
got
conviction
the
younger
sister
piped
we
misjudged
poor
aggie
john
but
i
feel
she
knows
now
wherever
she
is
she
knows
that
we
know
she
is
yes
she
knows
i
felt
it
too
said
miss
elizabeth
i
never
doubted
said
john
baxter
whose
face
was
beautiful
at
that
hour
not
from
the
first
never
have
you
never
offered
me
proof
john
now
thank
god
it
will
not
be
the
same
any
more
i
can
think
henceforward
of
aggie
without
she
tripped
absolutely
tripped
across
the
hall
what
ideas
these
jews
have
of
arranging
furniture
she
spied
me
behind
a
big
cloisonnee
vase
i
seen
the
window
she
said
remotely
you
took
a
great
risk
in
advising
me
to
undertake
such
a
journey
however
as
it
turns
out
i
forgive
you
and
i
pray
you
may
never
know
what
mental
anguish
means
bessie
look
at
this
peculiar
piano
do
you
suppose
doctor
these
people
would
offer
one
tea
i
miss
i
will
go
and
see
i
said
and
explored
wing
it
was
in
the
servants
hall
that
i
unearthed
the
family
bursting
with
anxiety
tea
for
three
quick
i
said
if
you
ask
me
any
questions
now
i
shall
have
a
fit
so
got
it
and
i
was
butler
amid
murmured
apologies
from
baxter
still
smiling
and
and
the
cold
disapproval
of
miss
mary
who
thought
the
pattern
of
the
china
vulgar
however
she
ate
well
and
even
asked
me
whether
i
would
not
like
a
cup
of
tea
for
myself
they
went
away
in
the
twilight
the
twilight
that
i
had
once
feared
they
were
going
to
an
hotel
in
london
to
rest
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
and
as
their
fly
turned
down
the
drive
i
capered
on
the
door
step
with
the
house
behind
me
then
i
heard
the
uncertain
feet
of
the
and
bade
them
not
to
turn
on
the
lights
but
to
feel
to
feel
what
i
had
done
for
the
shadow
was
gone
with
the
dumb
desire
in
the
air
they
drew
short
but
afterwards
deeper
breaths
like
bathers
entering
chill
water
separated
one
from
the
other
moved
about
the
hall
tiptoed
upstairs
raced
down
and
then
miss
and
i
believe
her
mother
though
she
denies
this
embraced
me
i
know
did
it
was
a
disgraceful
evening
to
say
we
rioted
through
the
house
is
to
put
it
mildly
we
played
a
sort
of
blind
man
buff
along
the
darkest
passages
in
the
unlighted
and
little
calling
cheerily
to
each
other
after
each
exploration
that
here
and
here
and
here
the
removed
itself
we
came
up
to
the
bedroom
mine
for
the
night
again
and
sat
the
women
on
the
bed
and
we
men
on
chairs
drinking
in
blessed
draughts
of
peace
and
comfort
and
cleanliness
of
soul
while
i
told
them
my
tale
in
full
and
received
fresh
praise
thanks
and
blessings
when
the
servants
returned
from
their
day
outing
gave
us
a
supper
of
cold
fried
fish
had
sense
enough
to
open
no
wine
we
had
been
practically
drunk
since
nightfall
and
grew
incoherent
on
water
and
milk
i
like
that
baxter
said
he
a
sharp
man
the
death
in
the
house
but
he
ran
it
pretty
close
ai
it
and
the
joke
of
it
is
that
he
supposes
i
want
to
buy
the
place
from
you
i
said
are
you
selling
not
for
twice
what
i
paid
for
it
now
said
i
keep
you
in
furs
all
your
life
but
not
our
no
never
our
holmescroft
said
miss
we
ask
him
here
on
tuesday
they
squeezed
each
other
hands
now
tell
me
said
that
tall
one
i
saw
out
of
the
scullery
window
did
she
tell
you
she
was
always
here
in
the
spirit
i
hate
her
she
made
all
this
trouble
it
was
not
her
house
after
she
had
sold
it
what
do
you
think
i
suppose
i
answered
she
brooded
over
what
she
believed
was
her
sister
suicide
night
and
day
she
confessed
she
did
and
her
thoughts
being
concentrated
on
this
place
they
felt
like
a
like
a
burning
burning
glass
is
good
said
i
said
it
was
like
a
light
of
blackness
turned
on
us
cried
the
girl
twiddling
her
ring
that
must
have
been
when
the
tall
one
thought
worst
about
her
sister
and
the
ah
the
poor
aggie
said
the
poor
aggie
trying
to
tell
every
one
it
was
not
so
no
wonder
we
felt
something
wished
to
say
something
thea
max
do
you
remember
that
night
we
need
not
remember
any
more
interrupted
it
is
not
our
trouble
they
have
told
each
other
do
you
think
then
said
miss
that
those
two
the
living
ones
were
actually
told
something
upstairs
in
your
in
the
room
i
ca
say
at
any
rate
they
were
made
happy
and
they
ate
a
big
tea
afterwards
as
your
father
says
it
is
not
our
trouble
any
longer
thank
god
amen
said
now
thea
let
us
have
some
music
after
all
these
months
mirth
thou
pretty
bird
ai
it
you
ought
to
hear
and
in
the
hall
thea
sang
an
old
english
song
that
i
had
never
heard
before
with
mirth
thou
pretty
bird
rejoice
thy
maker
praise
enhanced
lift
up
thy
shrill
and
pleasant
voice
thy
god
is
high
advanced
thy
food
before
he
did
provide
and
gives
it
in
a
fitting
side
wherewith
be
thou
sufficed
why
shouldst
thou
now
unpleasant
be
thy
wrath
against
god
venting
that
he
a
little
bird
made
thee
thy
silly
head
tormenting
because
he
made
thee
not
a
man
oh
peace
he
hath
well
thought
thereon
therewith
be
thou
sufficed
the
rabbi
song
if
thought
can
reach
to
heaven
on
heaven
let
it
dwell
for
fear
that
thought
be
given
like
power
to
reach
to
hell
for
fear
the
desolation
and
darkness
of
thy
mind
perplex
an
habitation
which
thou
hast
left
behind
let
nothing
linger
after
no
whispering
ghost
remain
in
wall
or
beam
or
rafter
of
any
hate
or
pain
cleanse
and
call
home
thy
spirit
deny
her
leave
to
cast
on
aught
thy
heirs
inherit
the
shadow
of
her
past
for
think
in
all
thy
sadness
what
road
our
griefs
may
take
whose
brain
reflect
our
madness
or
whom
our
terrors
shake
for
think
lest
any
languish
by
cause
of
thy
distress
the
arrows
of
our
anguish
fly
farther
than
we
guess
our
lives
our
tears
as
water
are
spilled
upon
the
ground
god
giveth
no
man
quarter
yet
god
a
means
hath
found
though
faith
and
hope
have
vanished
and
even
love
grows
dim
a
means
whereby
his
banished
be
not
expelled
from
him
