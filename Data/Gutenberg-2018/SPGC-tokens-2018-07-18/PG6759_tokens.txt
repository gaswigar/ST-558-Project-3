introduction
the
adventures
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
smollett
third
novel
was
given
to
the
world
in
lady
mary
wortley
montagu
writing
to
her
daughter
the
countess
of
bute
over
a
year
later
january
remarked
that
my
friend
smollett
has
certainly
a
talent
for
invention
though
i
think
it
flags
a
little
in
his
last
work
lady
mary
was
both
right
and
wrong
the
inventive
power
which
we
commonly
think
of
as
smollett
was
the
ability
to
work
over
his
own
experience
into
realistic
fiction
of
this
ferdinand
count
fathom
shows
comparatively
little
it
shows
relatively
little
too
of
smollett
vigorous
personality
which
in
his
earlier
works
was
present
to
give
life
and
interest
to
almost
every
chapter
were
it
to
describe
a
street
brawl
a
ludicrous
situation
a
whimsical
character
or
with
venomous
prejudice
to
gibbet
some
enemy
this
individuality
the
peculiar
spirit
of
the
author
which
can
be
felt
rather
than
described
is
present
in
the
dedication
of
fathom
to
doctor
who
is
no
other
than
smollett
himself
and
a
candid
revelation
of
his
character
by
the
way
this
dedication
contains
it
is
present
too
in
the
opening
chapters
which
show
likewise
in
the
picture
of
fathom
mother
something
of
the
author
peculiar
talent
for
invention
subsequently
however
there
is
no
denying
that
the
smollett
invention
and
the
smollett
spirit
both
flag
and
yet
in
a
way
fathom
displays
more
invention
than
any
of
the
author
novels
it
is
based
far
less
than
any
other
on
personal
experience
unfortunately
such
invention
was
not
suited
to
smollett
genius
the
result
is
that
while
uninteresting
as
a
novel
of
contemporary
manners
fathom
has
an
interest
of
its
own
in
that
it
reveals
a
new
side
of
its
author
we
think
of
smollett
generally
as
a
rambling
storyteller
a
rational
unromantic
man
of
the
world
who
fills
his
pages
with
his
own
acquaintances
and
experiences
the
smollett
of
count
fathom
on
the
contrary
is
rather
a
forerunner
of
the
romantic
school
who
has
created
a
tolerably
organic
tale
of
adventure
out
of
his
own
brain
though
this
is
notably
less
readable
than
the
author
earlier
works
still
the
wonder
is
that
when
the
man
is
so
far
off
his
beat
he
should
yet
know
so
well
how
to
meet
the
strange
conditions
which
confront
him
to
one
whose
idea
of
smollett
genius
is
formed
entirely
by
random
and
pickle
and
humphry
clinker
ferdinand
count
fathom
will
offer
many
surprises
the
first
of
these
is
the
comparative
lifelessness
of
the
book
true
here
again
are
action
and
incident
galore
but
generally
unaccompanied
by
that
rough
georgian
common
in
smollett
which
is
so
interesting
to
contemplate
from
a
comfortable
distance
and
which
goes
so
far
towards
making
his
fiction
seem
real
nor
are
the
characters
for
the
most
part
enough
to
be
interesting
there
is
an
apparent
exception
to
be
sure
in
the
hero
mother
already
mentioned
the
hardened
whom
we
confidently
expect
to
become
vitalised
after
the
savage
fashion
of
smollett
characters
but
alas
we
have
no
chance
to
learn
the
lady
style
of
conversation
for
the
few
words
that
come
from
her
lips
are
but
partially
characteristic
we
have
only
too
little
chance
to
learn
her
manners
and
customs
in
the
fourth
chapter
while
she
is
making
sure
with
her
dagger
that
all
those
on
the
field
of
battle
whom
she
wishes
to
rifle
are
really
dead
an
officer
of
the
hussars
who
has
been
watching
her
lucrative
progress
unfeelingly
puts
a
brace
of
bullets
into
the
lady
brain
just
as
she
raises
her
hand
to
smite
him
to
the
heart
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
she
is
thus
removed
before
our
disappointment
at
the
of
her
promise
becomes
poignant
so
far
as
we
may
judge
from
the
other
personages
of
count
fathom
even
this
interesting
amazon
would
sooner
or
later
have
turned
into
a
wooden
figure
with
a
label
giving
the
necessary
information
as
to
her
character
such
certainly
is
her
son
fathom
the
hero
of
the
book
because
he
is
placarded
shrewd
villain
of
monstrous
inhumanity
we
are
fain
to
accept
him
for
what
his
creator
intended
but
seldom
in
word
or
deed
is
he
a
convincingly
real
villain
his
friend
and
foil
the
noble
young
count
de
melvil
is
no
more
alive
than
he
and
equally
wooden
are
joshua
the
jew
and
that
tedious
foolish
don
diego
neither
is
the
heroine
alive
the
peerless
monimia
but
then
in
her
case
want
of
vitality
is
not
surprising
the
presence
of
it
would
amaze
us
if
she
were
a
woman
throbbing
with
life
she
would
be
different
from
smollett
other
heroines
the
second
lady
of
the
melodrama
mademoiselle
de
melvil
though
by
no
means
vivified
is
yet
more
real
than
her
the
fact
that
they
are
mostly
inanimate
figures
is
not
the
only
surprise
given
us
by
the
personages
of
count
fathom
it
is
a
surprise
to
find
few
of
them
strikingly
whimsical
it
is
a
surprise
to
find
them
in
some
cases
far
more
distinctly
conceived
than
any
of
the
people
in
roderick
random
or
peregrine
pickle
in
the
second
of
these
we
saw
smollett
beginning
to
understand
the
use
of
incident
to
indicate
consistent
development
of
character
in
count
fathom
he
seems
fully
to
understand
this
principle
of
art
though
he
has
not
learned
to
apply
it
successfully
and
so
in
spite
of
an
excellent
conception
fathom
as
i
have
said
is
unreal
after
all
his
villainies
which
he
perpetrates
without
any
apparent
qualms
of
conscience
it
is
incredible
that
he
should
honestly
repent
of
his
crimes
we
are
much
inclined
to
doubt
when
we
read
that
his
vice
and
ambition
was
now
quite
mortified
within
him
the
subsequent
testimony
of
matthew
bramble
in
humphry
clinker
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
yet
fathom
up
to
this
point
is
consistently
drawn
and
drawn
for
a
purpose
to
show
that
roguery
though
successful
for
a
while
will
come
to
grief
in
the
end
to
heighten
the
effect
of
his
scoundrel
smollett
develops
parallel
with
him
the
virtuous
count
de
melvil
the
author
scheme
of
thus
using
one
character
as
the
foil
of
another
though
not
conspicuous
for
its
originality
shows
a
decided
advance
in
the
theory
of
constructive
technique
only
as
i
have
said
smollett
execution
is
now
defective
but
one
will
naturally
ask
if
fathom
lacks
the
amusing
and
not
infrequently
stimulating
of
smollett
former
novels
if
its
characters
though
are
seldom
divertingly
fantastic
and
never
thoroughly
animate
what
makes
the
book
interesting
the
surprise
will
be
greater
than
ever
when
the
answer
is
given
that
to
a
large
extent
the
plot
makes
fathom
interesting
yes
smollett
hitherto
indifferent
to
structure
has
here
written
a
story
in
which
the
plot
itself
often
clumsy
though
it
may
be
engages
a
reader
attention
one
actually
wants
to
know
whether
the
young
count
is
ever
going
to
receive
consolation
for
his
sorrows
and
inflict
justice
on
his
basely
ungrateful
pensioner
and
when
finally
all
turns
out
as
it
should
one
is
amazed
to
find
how
many
of
the
people
in
the
book
have
helped
towards
the
designed
conclusion
not
all
of
them
indeed
nor
all
of
the
adventures
are
indispensable
but
it
is
manifest
at
the
end
that
much
which
for
the
time
most
readers
think
irrelevant
such
as
don
diego
history
is
after
all
essential
it
has
already
been
said
that
in
count
fathom
smollett
appears
to
some
extent
as
a
romanticist
and
this
is
another
fact
which
lends
interest
to
the
book
that
he
had
a
powerful
imagination
is
not
a
surprise
any
one
versed
in
smollett
has
already
seen
it
in
the
remarkable
situations
which
he
has
put
before
us
in
his
earlier
works
these
do
not
indicate
however
that
smollett
possessed
the
imagination
which
could
excite
romantic
interest
for
in
roderick
random
and
in
peregrine
pickle
the
wonderful
situations
serve
chiefly
to
amuse
in
fathom
however
there
are
some
designed
to
excite
horror
and
one
at
least
is
eminently
successful
the
hero
night
in
the
wood
between
and
chalons
was
no
doubt
more
to
our
ancestors
than
it
is
to
us
who
have
become
acquainted
with
scores
of
similar
situations
in
the
small
number
of
exciting
romances
which
belong
to
literature
and
in
the
greater
number
which
do
not
still
even
a
reader
with
his
taste
jaded
by
trashy
novels
will
be
conscious
of
smollett
power
and
of
several
thrills
likewise
as
he
reads
about
fathom
experience
in
the
loft
in
which
the
beldame
locks
him
to
pass
the
night
this
situation
is
melodramatic
rather
than
romantic
as
the
word
is
used
technically
in
application
to
eighteenth
and
literature
there
is
no
little
in
fathom
however
which
is
genuinely
romantic
in
the
latter
sense
such
is
the
imprisonment
of
the
countess
in
the
whence
she
waves
her
handkerchief
to
the
young
count
her
son
and
rescuer
and
especially
so
is
the
scene
in
the
church
when
renaldo
the
very
name
is
romantic
visits
at
midnight
the
supposed
grave
of
his
while
he
was
waiting
for
the
sexton
to
open
the
door
his
soul
was
wound
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
enthusiastic
sorrow
the
uncommon
darkness
the
solemn
silence
and
lonely
situation
of
the
place
conspired
with
the
occasion
of
his
coming
and
the
dismal
images
of
his
fancy
to
produce
a
real
rapture
of
gloomy
expectation
which
the
whole
world
could
not
have
persuaded
him
to
disappoint
the
clock
struck
twelve
the
owl
screeched
from
the
ruined
battlement
the
door
was
opened
by
the
sexton
who
by
the
light
of
a
glimmering
taper
conducted
the
despairing
lover
to
a
dreary
aisle
and
stamped
upon
the
ground
with
his
foot
saying
the
young
lady
lies
interred
we
have
here
such
an
amount
of
the
usual
romantic
machinery
of
the
school
of
poets
that
school
of
which
professor
phelps
calls
young
in
his
night
thoughts
the
most
conspicuous
exemplar
that
one
is
at
first
inclined
to
think
smollett
poking
fun
at
it
the
context
however
seems
to
prove
that
he
was
perfectly
serious
it
is
interesting
then
as
well
as
surprising
to
find
traces
of
the
romantic
spirit
in
his
fiction
over
ten
years
before
walpole
castle
of
otranto
it
is
also
interesting
to
find
so
much
melodramatic
feeling
in
him
because
it
makes
stronger
the
connection
between
him
and
his
disciple
dickens
from
all
that
i
have
said
it
must
not
be
thought
that
the
usual
smollett
is
always
or
almost
always
absent
from
count
fathom
i
have
spoken
of
the
dedication
and
of
the
opening
chapters
as
what
we
might
expect
from
his
pen
there
are
besides
true
smollett
strokes
in
the
scenes
in
the
prison
from
which
melvil
rescues
fathom
and
there
is
a
good
deal
of
the
satirical
smollett
fun
in
the
description
of
fathom
ups
and
downs
first
as
the
petted
beau
and
then
as
the
fashionable
doctor
in
chronicling
the
latter
meteoric
career
smollett
had
already
observed
the
peculiarity
of
his
countrymen
which
thackeray
was
fond
of
harping
on
in
the
next
century
the
maxim
which
universally
prevails
among
the
english
people
to
overlook
on
their
return
to
the
metropolis
all
the
connexions
they
may
have
chanced
to
acquire
during
their
residence
at
any
of
the
medical
wells
and
this
social
disposition
is
so
scrupulously
maintained
that
two
persons
who
live
in
the
most
intimate
correspondence
at
bath
or
tunbridge
shall
in
hours
meet
in
james
park
without
betraying
the
least
token
of
recognition
and
good
too
is
the
way
in
which
as
fathom
goes
rapidly
down
the
social
hill
he
makes
excuses
for
his
declining
splendour
his
chariot
was
overturned
with
a
hideous
crash
at
such
danger
to
himself
that
he
did
not
believe
he
should
ever
hazard
himself
again
in
any
sort
of
wheel
carriage
he
turned
off
his
men
for
maids
because
men
servants
are
generally
impudent
lazy
debauched
or
dishonest
to
avoid
the
din
of
the
street
he
shifted
his
lodgings
into
a
quiet
obscure
court
and
so
forth
and
so
on
in
the
true
smollett
vein
but
after
all
such
of
the
old
sparks
are
struck
only
occasionally
apart
from
its
plot
which
not
a
few
writers
of
might
have
improved
the
adventures
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
is
less
interesting
for
itself
than
any
other
piece
of
fiction
from
smollett
pen
for
a
student
of
smollett
however
it
is
highly
interesting
as
showing
the
author
romantic
melodramatic
tendencies
and
the
growth
of
his
constructive
technique
maynadier
the
adventures
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
to
doctor
you
and
i
my
good
friend
have
often
deliberated
on
the
difficulty
of
writing
such
a
dedication
as
might
gratify
the
of
a
patron
without
exposing
the
author
to
the
ridicule
or
censure
of
the
public
and
i
think
we
generally
agreed
that
the
task
was
altogether
indeed
this
was
one
of
the
few
subjects
on
which
we
have
always
thought
in
the
same
manner
for
notwithstanding
that
deference
and
regard
which
we
mutually
pay
to
each
other
certain
it
is
we
have
often
differed
according
to
the
predominancy
of
those
different
passions
which
frequently
warp
the
opinion
and
perplex
the
understanding
of
the
most
judicious
in
dedication
as
in
poetry
there
is
no
medium
for
if
any
one
of
the
human
virtues
be
omitted
in
the
enumeration
of
the
patron
good
qualities
the
whole
address
is
construed
into
an
affront
and
the
writer
has
the
mortification
to
find
his
praise
prostituted
to
very
little
purpose
on
the
other
hand
should
he
yield
to
the
transports
of
gratitude
or
affection
which
is
always
apt
to
exaggerate
and
produce
no
more
than
the
genuine
effusions
of
his
heart
the
world
will
make
no
allowance
for
the
warmth
of
his
passion
but
ascribe
the
praise
he
bestows
to
interested
views
and
sordid
adulation
sometimes
too
dazzled
by
the
tinsel
of
a
character
which
he
has
no
opportunity
to
investigate
he
pours
forth
the
homage
of
his
admiration
upon
some
false
maecenas
whose
future
conduct
gives
the
lie
to
his
eulogium
and
involves
him
in
shame
and
confusion
of
face
such
was
the
fate
of
a
late
ingenious
author
the
author
of
the
seasons
who
was
so
often
put
to
the
blush
for
the
undeserved
incense
he
had
offered
in
the
heat
of
an
enthusiastic
disposition
misled
by
popular
applause
that
he
had
resolved
to
retract
in
his
last
will
all
the
encomiums
which
he
had
thus
prematurely
bestowed
and
stigmatise
the
unworthy
by
name
a
laudable
scheme
of
poetical
justice
the
execution
of
which
was
fatally
prevented
by
untimely
death
whatever
may
have
been
the
fate
of
other
dedicators
i
for
my
own
part
sit
down
to
write
this
address
without
any
apprehension
of
disgrace
or
disappointment
because
i
know
you
are
too
well
convinced
of
my
affection
and
sincerity
to
repine
at
what
i
shall
say
touching
your
character
and
conduct
and
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
believe
that
this
public
distinction
is
a
testimony
of
my
particular
friendship
and
esteem
not
that
i
am
either
insensible
of
your
infirmities
or
disposed
to
conceal
them
from
the
notice
of
mankind
there
are
certain
foibles
which
can
only
be
cured
by
shame
and
mortification
and
whether
or
not
yours
be
of
that
species
i
shall
have
the
comfort
to
think
my
best
endeavours
were
used
for
your
reformation
know
then
i
can
despise
your
pride
while
i
honour
your
integrity
and
applaud
your
taste
while
i
am
shocked
at
your
i
have
known
you
trifling
superficial
and
obstinate
in
dispute
meanly
jealous
and
awkwardly
reserved
rash
and
haughty
in
your
resentments
and
coarse
and
lowly
in
your
connexions
i
have
blushed
at
the
weakness
of
your
conversation
and
trembled
at
the
errors
of
your
conduct
yet
as
i
own
you
possess
certain
good
qualities
which
overbalance
these
defects
and
distinguish
you
on
this
occasion
as
a
person
for
whom
i
have
the
most
perfect
attachment
and
esteem
you
have
no
cause
to
complain
of
the
indelicacy
with
which
your
faults
are
reprehended
and
as
they
are
chiefly
the
excesses
of
a
sanguine
disposition
and
looseness
of
thought
impatient
of
caution
or
control
you
may
thus
stimulated
watch
over
your
own
intemperance
and
infirmity
with
redoubled
vigilance
and
consideration
and
for
the
future
profit
by
the
severity
of
my
reproof
these
however
are
not
the
only
motives
that
induce
me
to
trouble
you
with
this
public
application
i
must
not
only
perform
my
duty
to
my
friends
but
also
discharge
the
debt
i
owe
to
my
own
interest
we
live
in
a
censorious
age
and
an
author
can
not
take
too
much
precaution
to
anticipate
the
prejudice
misapprehension
and
temerity
of
malice
ignorance
and
presumption
i
therefore
think
it
incumbent
upon
me
to
give
some
previous
intimation
of
the
plan
which
i
have
executed
in
the
subsequent
performance
that
i
may
not
be
condemned
upon
partial
evidence
and
to
whom
can
i
with
more
propriety
appeal
in
my
explanation
than
to
you
who
are
so
well
acquainted
with
all
the
sentiments
and
emotions
of
my
breast
a
novel
is
a
large
diffused
picture
comprehending
the
characters
of
life
disposed
in
different
groups
and
exhibited
in
various
attitudes
for
the
purposes
of
an
uniform
plan
and
general
occurrence
to
which
every
individual
figure
is
subservient
but
this
plan
can
not
be
executed
with
propriety
probability
or
success
without
a
principal
personage
to
attract
the
attention
unite
the
incidents
unwind
the
clue
of
the
labyrinth
and
at
last
close
the
scene
by
virtue
of
his
own
importance
almost
all
the
heroes
of
this
kind
who
have
hitherto
succeeded
on
the
english
stage
are
characters
of
transcendent
worth
conducted
through
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
to
that
goal
of
happiness
which
ever
ought
to
be
the
repose
of
extraordinary
yet
the
same
principle
by
which
we
rejoice
at
the
remuneration
of
merit
will
teach
us
to
relish
the
disgrace
and
discomfiture
of
vice
which
is
always
an
example
of
extensive
use
and
influence
because
it
leaves
a
deep
impression
of
terror
upon
the
minds
of
those
who
were
not
confirmed
in
the
pursuit
of
morality
and
virtue
and
while
the
balance
wavers
enables
the
right
scale
to
preponderate
in
the
drama
which
is
a
more
limited
field
of
invention
the
chief
personage
is
often
the
object
of
our
detestation
and
abhorrence
and
we
are
as
well
pleased
to
see
the
wicked
schemes
of
a
richard
blasted
and
the
perfidy
of
a
maskwell
exposed
as
to
behold
a
bevil
happy
and
an
edward
victorious
the
impulses
of
fear
which
is
the
most
violent
and
interesting
of
all
the
passions
remain
longer
than
any
other
upon
the
memory
and
for
one
that
is
allured
to
virtue
by
the
contemplation
of
that
peace
and
happiness
which
it
bestows
a
hundred
are
deterred
from
the
practice
of
vice
by
that
infamy
and
punishment
to
which
it
is
liable
from
the
laws
and
regulations
of
mankind
let
me
not
therefore
be
condemned
for
having
chosen
my
principal
character
from
the
purlieus
of
treachery
and
fraud
when
i
declare
my
purpose
is
to
set
him
up
as
a
beacon
for
the
benefit
of
the
unexperienced
and
unwary
who
from
the
perusal
of
these
memoirs
may
learn
to
avoid
the
manifold
snares
with
which
they
are
continually
surrounded
in
the
paths
of
life
while
those
who
hesitate
on
the
brink
of
iniquity
may
be
terrified
from
plunging
into
that
irremediable
gulf
by
surveying
the
deplorable
fate
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
that
the
mind
might
not
be
fatigued
nor
the
imagination
disgusted
by
a
succession
of
vicious
objects
i
have
endeavoured
to
refresh
the
attention
with
occasional
incidents
of
a
different
nature
and
raised
up
a
virtuous
character
in
opposition
to
the
adventurer
with
a
view
to
amuse
the
fancy
engage
the
affection
and
form
a
striking
contrast
which
might
heighten
the
expression
and
give
a
relief
to
the
moral
of
the
whole
if
i
have
not
succeeded
in
my
endeavours
to
unfold
the
mysteries
of
fraud
to
instruct
the
ignorant
and
entertain
the
vacant
if
i
have
failed
in
my
attempts

subject
folly
to
ridicule

indignation

rouse
the
spirit

mirth

the
soul
of
compassion

touch
the
secret

adorned

applause

iniquity
with
reproach

carefully
avoided

hint
or
expression

the
most
delicate

circumstances
which
whatever
may
be
my
fate
with
the
public
will
with
you
always
operate
in
favour
of
dear
sir
your
very
affectionate
friend
and
servant
the
author
chapter
one
some
sage
observations
that
naturally
introduce
our
important
history
cardinal
de
retz
very
judiciously
observes
that
all
historians
must
of
necessity
be
subject
to
mistakes
in
explaining
the
motives
of
those
actions
they
record
unless
they
derive
their
intelligence
from
the
candid
confession
of
the
person
whose
character
they
represent
and
that
of
consequence
every
man
of
importance
ought
to
write
his
own
memoirs
provided
he
has
honesty
enough
to
tell
the
truth
without
suppressing
any
circumstance
that
may
tend
to
the
information
of
the
reader
this
however
is
a
requisite
that
i
am
afraid
would
be
very
rarely
found
among
the
number
of
those
who
exhibit
their
own
portraits
to
the
public
indeed
i
will
venture
to
say
that
how
upright
soever
a
intentions
may
be
he
will
in
the
performance
of
such
a
task
be
sometimes
misled
by
his
own
phantasy
and
represent
objects
as
they
appeared
to
him
through
the
mists
of
prejudice
and
passion
an
unconcerned
reader
when
he
peruses
the
history
of
two
competitors
who
lived
two
thousand
years
ago
or
who
perhaps
never
had
existence
except
in
the
imagination
of
the
author
can
not
help
interesting
himself
in
the
dispute
and
espousing
one
side
of
the
contest
with
all
the
zeal
of
a
warm
adherent
what
wonder
then
that
we
should
be
heated
in
our
own
concerns
review
our
actions
with
the
same
that
they
had
formerly
acquired
and
recommend
them
to
the
world
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
paternal
affection
supposing
this
to
be
the
case
it
was
lucky
for
the
cause
of
historical
truth
that
so
many
pens
have
been
drawn
by
writers
who
could
not
be
suspected
of
such
partiality
and
that
many
great
personages
among
the
ancients
as
well
as
moderns
either
would
not
or
could
not
entertain
the
public
with
their
own
memoirs
from
this
want
of
inclination
or
capacity
to
write
in
our
hero
himself
the
undertaking
is
now
left
to
me
of
transmitting
to
posterity
the
remarkable
adventures
of
ferdinand
count
fathom
and
by
the
time
the
reader
shall
have
glanced
over
the
subsequent
sheets
i
doubt
not
but
he
will
bless
god
that
the
adventurer
was
not
his
own
historian
this
mirror
of
modern
chivalry
was
none
of
those
who
owe
their
dignity
to
the
circumstances
of
their
birth
and
are
consecrated
from
the
cradle
for
the
purposes
of
greatness
merely
because
they
are
the
accidental
children
of
wealth
he
was
heir
to
no
visible
patrimony
unless
we
reckon
a
robust
constitution
a
tolerable
appearance
and
an
uncommon
capacity
as
the
advantages
of
inheritance
if
the
comparison
obtains
in
this
point
of
consideration
he
was
as
much
as
any
man
indebted
to
his
parent
and
pity
it
was
that
in
the
sequel
of
his
fortune
he
never
had
an
opportunity
of
manifesting
his
filial
gratitude
and
regard
from
this
agreeable
act
of
duty
to
his
sire
and
all
those
tendernesses
that
are
reciprocally
enjoyed
betwixt
the
father
and
the
son
he
was
unhappily
excluded
by
a
small
circumstance
at
which
however
he
was
never
heard
to
repine
in
short
had
he
been
brought
forth
in
the
fabulous
ages
of
the
world
the
nature
of
his
origin
might
have
turned
to
his
account
he
might
like
other
heroes
of
antiquity
have
laid
claim
to
divine
extraction
without
running
the
risk
of
being
claimed
by
an
earthly
father
not
that
his
parents
had
any
reason
to
disown
or
renounce
their
offspring
or
that
there
was
anything
preternatural
in
the
circumstances
of
his
generation
and
birth
on
the
contrary
he
was
from
the
beginning
a
child
of
promising
parts
and
in
due
course
of
nature
ushered
into
the
world
amidst
a
whole
cloud
of
witnesses
but
that
he
was
acknowledged
by
no
mortal
sire
solely
proceeded
from
the
uncertainty
of
his
mother
whose
affections
were
so
dissipated
among
a
number
of
admirers
that
she
could
never
pitch
upon
the
person
from
whose
loins
our
hero
sprung
over
and
above
this
important
doubt
under
which
he
was
begotten
other
particularities
attended
his
birth
and
seemed
to
mark
him
out
as
something
uncommon
among
the
sons
of
men
he
was
brought
forth
in
a
waggon
and
might
be
said
to
be
literally
a
native
of
two
different
countries
for
though
he
first
saw
the
light
in
holland
he
was
not
born
till
after
the
carriage
arrived
in
flanders
so
that
all
these
extraordinary
circumstances
considered
the
task
of
determining
to
what
government
he
naturally
owed
allegiance
would
be
at
least
as
difficult
as
that
of
ascertaining
the
so
much
contested
birthplace
of

certain
it
is
the
count
mother
was
an
englishwoman
who
after
having
been
five
times
a
widow
in
one
campaign
was
in
the
last
year
of
the
renowned
marlborough
command
numbered
among
the
baggage
of
the
allied
army
which
she
still
accompanied
through
pure
benevolence
of
spirit
supplying
the
ranks
with
the
refreshing
streams
of
choice
geneva
and
accommodating
individuals
with
clean
linen
as
the
emergency
of
their
occasions
required
nor
was
her
philanthropy
altogether
confined
to
such
ministration
she
abounded
with
the
milk
of
human
kindness
which
flowed
plentifully
among
her
and
to
every
son
of
mars
who
cultivated
her
favour
she
liberally
dispensed
her
smiles
in
order
to
sweeten
the
toils
and
dangers
of
the
field
and
here
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
anticipate
the
remarks
of
the
reader
who
in
the
chastity
and
excellency
of
his
conception
may
possibly
exclaim
good
heaven
will
these
authors
never
reform
their
imaginations
and
lift
their
ideas
from
the
obscene
objects
of
low
life
must
the
public
be
again
disgusted
with
the
grovelling
adventures
of
a
waggon
will
no
writer
of
genius
draw
his
pen
in
the
vindication
of
taste
and
entertain
us
with
the
agreeable
characters

dignified
conversation

poignant
repartee

genteel
comedy
of
the
polite
world

a
little
patience
gentle
delicate
sublime
critic
you
i
doubt
not
are
one
of
those
consummate
connoisseurs
who
in
their
purifications
let
humour
evaporate
while
they
endeavour
to
preserve
decorum
and
polish
wit
until
the
edge
of
it
is
quite
worn
off
or
perhaps
of
that
class
who
in
the
sapience
of
taste
are
disgusted
with
those
very
flavours
in
the
productions
of
their
own
country
which
have
yielded
infinite
delectation
to
their
faculties
when
imported
from
another
clime
and
d
n
an
author
in
despite
of
all
precedent
and
prescription
who
extol
the
writings
of
petronius
arbiter
read
with
rapture
the
amorous
sallies
of
ovid
pen
and
chuckle
over
the
story
of
lucian
ass
yet
if
a
modern
author
presumes
to
relate
the
progress
of
a
simple
intrigue
are
shocked
at
the
indecency
and
immorality
of
the
scene
who
delight
in
following
guzman
through
all
the
mazes
of
squalid
beggary
who
with
pleasure
accompany
don
quixote
and
his
squire
in
the
lowest
paths
of
fortune

are
diverted
with
the
adventures
of

of
strollers

highly
entertained
with
the
servile
situations
of

blas
yet
when
a
character
in
humble
life
occasionally
occurs
in
a
performance
of
our
own
growth
exclaim
with
an
air
of
disgust
was
ever
anything
so
mean
sure
this
writer
must
have
been
very
conversant
with
the
lowest
scenes
of
life
who
when
swift
or
pope
represents
a
coxcomb
in
the
act
of
swearing
scruple
not
to
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
execrations
but
in
a
less
reputed
author
condemn
the
use
of
such
profane
expletives
who
eagerly
explore
the
jakes
of
rabelais
for
amusement
and
even
extract
humour
from
the
dean
description
of
a
lady
yet
in
a
production
of
these
days
unstamped
with
such
venerable
names
will
stop
their
noses
with
all
the
signs
of
loathing
and
abhorrence
at
a
bare
mention
of
the
china
who
applauded
catullus
juvenal
persius
and
lucan
for
their
spirit
in
lashing
the
greatest
names
of
antiquity
yet
when
a
british
satirist
of
this
generation
has
courage
enough
to
call
in
question
the
talents
of
a
in
power
accuse
him
of
insolence
rancour
and
scurrility
if
such
you
be
courteous
reader
i
say
again
have
a
little
patience
for
your
entertainment
we
are
about
to
write
our
hero
shall
with
all
convenient
despatch
be
gradually
sublimed
into
those
splendid
connexions
of
which
you
are
enamoured
and
god
forbid
that
in
the
meantime
the
nature
of
his
extraction
should
turn
to
his
prejudice
in
a
land
of
freedom
like
this
where
individuals
are
every
day
ennobled
in
consequence
of
their
own
qualifications
without
the
least
retrospective
regard
to
the
rank
or
merit
of
their
ancestors
yes
refined
reader
we
are
hastening
to
that
goal
of
perfection
where
satire
dares
not
show
her
face
where
nature
is
castigated
almost
even
to
still
life
where
humour
turns
changeling
and
slavers
in
an
insipid
grin
where
wit
is
volatilised
into
a
mere
vapour
where
decency
divested
of
all
substance
hovers
about
like
a
fantastic
shadow
where
the
salt
of
genius
escaping
leaves
nothing
but
pure
and
simple
phlegm
and
the
inoffensive
pen
for
ever
drops
the
mild
manna
of
praise
chapter
two
a
superficial
view
of
our
hero
infancy
having
thus
bespoken
the
indulgence
of
our
guests
let
us
now
produce
the
particulars
of
our
entertainment
and
speedily
conduct
our
adventurer
through
the
stage
of
infancy
which
seldom
teems
with
interesting
incidents
as
the
occupations
of
his
mother
would
not
conveniently
permit
her
to
suckle
this
her
firstborn
at
her
own
breast
and
those
happy
ages
were
now
no
more
in
which
the
charge
of
nursing
a
child
might
be
left
to
the
next
goat
or
she
resolved
to
improve
upon
the
ordinances
of
nature
and
foster
him
with
a
juice
much
more
energetic
than
the
milk
of
goat
wolf
or
woman
this
was
no
other
than
that
delicious
nectar
which
as
we
have
already
hinted
she
so
cordially
distributed
from
a
small
cask
that
hung
before
her
depending
from
her
shoulders
by
a
leathern
zone
thus
determined
ere
he
was
yet
twelve
days
old
she
enclosed
him
in
a
canvas
knapsack
which
being
adjusted
to
her
neck
fell
down
upon
her
back
and
balanced
the
cargo
that
rested
on
her
bosom
there
are
not
wanting
those
who
affirm
that
while
her
double
charge
was
carried
about
in
this
situation
her
keg
was
furnished
with
a
long
and
slender
flexible
tube
which
when
the
child
began
to
be
clamorous
she
conveyed
into
his
mouth
and
straight
he
stilled
himself
with
sucking
but
this
we
consider
as
an
extravagant
assertion
of
those
who
mix
the
marvellous
in
all
their
narrations
because
we
can
not
conceive
how
the
tender
organs
of
an
infant
could
digest
such
a
fiery
beverage
which
never
fails
to
discompose
the
constitutions
of
the
most
hardy
and
robust
we
therefore
conclude
that
the
use
of
this
potation
was
more
restrained
and
that
it
was
with
simple
element
diluted
into
a
composition
adapted
to
his
taste
and
years
be
this
as
it
will
he
certainly
was
indulged
in
the
use
of
it
to
such
a
degree
as
would
have
effectually
obstructed
his
future
fortune
had
not
he
been
happily
cloyed
with
the
repetition
of
the
same
fare
for
which
he
conceived
the
utmost
detestation
and
abhorrence
rejecting
it
with
loathing
and
disgust
like
those
choice
spirits
who
having
been
crammed
with
religion
in
their
childhood
renounce
it
in
their
youth
among
other
absurd
prejudices
of
education
while
he
was
thus
dangled
in
a
state
of
suspension
a
german
trooper
was
transiently
smit
with
the
charms
of
his
mother
who
listened
to
his
honourable
addresses
and
once
more
received
the
silken
bonds
of
matrimony
the
ceremony
having
been
performed
as
usual
at
the
the
lady
had
no
sooner
taken
possession
of
her
new
name
than
she
bestowed
it
upon
her
son
who
was
thenceforward
distinguished
by
the
appellation
of
ferdinand
de
fadom
nor
was
the
husband
offended
at
this
presumption
in
his
wife
which
he
not
only
considered
as
a
proof
of
her
affection
and
esteem
but
also
as
a
compliment
by
which
he
might
in
time
acquire
the
credit
of
being
the
real
father
of
such
a
hopeful
child
notwithstanding
this
new
engagement
with
a
foreigner
our
hero
mother
still
exercised
the
virtues
of
her
calling
among
the
english
troops
so
much
was
she
biassed
by
that
laudable
partiality
which
as
horace
observes
the
natale
solum
generally
inspires
indeed
this
inclination
was
enforced
by
another
reason
that
did
not
fail
to
influence
her
conduct
in
this
particular
all
her
knowledge
of
the
high
dutch
language
consisted
in
some
words
of
traffic
absolutely
necessary
for
the
practice
of
hex
vocation
together
with
sundry
oaths
and
terms
of
reproach
that
kept
her
customers
in
awe
so
that
except
among
her
own
countrymen
she
could
not
indulge
that
propensity
to
conversation
for
which
she
had
been
remarkable
from
her
earliest
years
nor
did
this
instance
of
her
affection
fail
of
turning
to
her
account
in
the
sequel
she
was
promoted
to
the
office
of
cook
to
a
regimental
mess
of
officers
and
before
the
peace
of
utrecht
was
actually
in
possession
of
a
pitched
for
the
accommodation
of
the
gentlemen
in
the
army
meanwhile
ferdinand
improved
apace
in
the
accomplishments
of
infancy
his
beauty
was
conspicuous
and
his
vigour
so
uncommon
that
he
was
with
justice
likened
unto
hercules
in
the
cradle
the
friends
of
his
dandled
him
on
their
knees
while
he
played
with
their
whiskers
and
before
he
was
thirteen
months
old
taught
him
to
suck
brandy
impregnated
with
gunpowder
through
the
of
a
pistol
at
the
same
time
he
was
caressed
by
divers
serjeants
of
the
british
army
who
severally
and
in
secret
contemplated
his
qualifications
with
a
father
pride
excited
by
the
artful
declaration
with
which
the
mother
had
flattered
each
apart
soon
as
the
war
was
for
her
unhappily
concluded
she
as
in
duty
bound
followed
her
husband
into
bohemia
and
his
regiment
being
sent
into
garrison
at
prague
she
opened
a
cabaret
in
that
city
which
was
frequented
by
a
good
many
guests
of
the
scotch
and
irish
nations
who
were
devoted
to
the
exercise
of
arms
in
the
service
of
the
emperor
it
was
by
this
communication
that
the
english
tongue
became
vernacular
to
young
ferdinand
who
without
such
opportunity
would
have
been
a
stranger
to
the
language
of
his
forefathers
in
spite
of
all
his
loquacity
and
elocution
though
it
must
be
owned
for
the
credit
of
her
maternal
care
that
she
let
slip
no
occasion
of
making
it
familiar
to
his
ear
and
conception
for
even
at
those
intervals
in
which
she
could
find
no
person
to
carry
on
the
altercation
she
used
to
hold
forth
in
earnest
soliloquies
upon
the
subject
of
her
own
situation
giving
vent
to
many
opprobrious
invectives
against
her
husband
country
between
which
and
old
england
she
drew
many
odious
comparisons
and
prayed
without
ceasing
that
europe
might
speedily
be
involved
in
a
general
war
so
as
that
she
might
have
some
chance
of
the
pleasures
and
emoluments
of
a
flanders
campaign
chapter
three
he
is
initiated
in
a
military
life
and
has
the
good
fortune
to
acquire
a
generous
patron
while
she
wearied
heaven
with
these
petitions
the
flame
of
war
broke
out
betwixt
the
houses
of
ottoman
and
austria
and
the
emperor
sent
forth
an
army
into
hungary
under
the
auspices
of
the
renowned
prince
eugene
on
account
of
this
expedition
the
mother
of
our
hero
gave
up
housekeeping
and
cheerfully
followed
her
customers
and
husband
into
the
field
having
first
provided
herself
with
store
of
those
commodities
in
which
she
had
formerly
merchandised
although
the
hope
of
profit
might
in
some
measure
affect
her
determination
one
of
the
chief
motives
for
her
visiting
the
frontiers
of
turkey
was
the
desire
of
initiating
her
son
in
the
rudiments
of
his
education
which
she
now
thought
high
time
to
inculcate
he
being
at
this
period
in
the
sixth
year
of
his
age
he
was
accordingly
conducted
to
the
camp
which
she
considered
as
the
most
consummate
school
of
life
and
proposed
for
the
scene
of
his
instruction
and
in
this
academy
he
had
not
continued
many
weeks
when
he
was
an
of
that
famous
victory
which
with
sixty
thousand
men
the
imperial
general
obtained
over
an
army
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
turks
his
was
engaged
and
his
mother
would
not
be
idle
on
this
occasion
she
was
a
perfect
mistress
of
all
the
camp
qualifications
and
thought
it
a
duty
incumbent
on
her
to
contribute
all
that
lay
in
her
power
towards
distressing
the
enemy
with
these
sentiments
she
hovered
about
the
skirts
of
the
army
and
the
troops
were
no
sooner
employed
in
the
pursuit
than
she
began
to
traverse
the
field
of
battle
with
a
poignard
and
a
bag
in
order
to
consult
her
own
interest
annoy
the
foe
and
exercise
her
humanity
at
the
same
time
in
short
she
had
with
amazing
prowess
delivered
some
fifty
or
threescore
disabled
mussulmen
of
the
pain
under
which
they
groaned
and
made
a
comfortable
booty
of
the
spoils
of
the
slain
when
her
eyes
were
attracted
by
the
rich
attire
of
an
imperial
officer
who
lay
bleeding
on
the
plain
to
all
appearance
in
the
agonies
of
death
she
could
not
in
her
heart
refuse
that
favour
to
a
friend
and
christian
she
had
so
compassionately
bestowed
upon
so
many
enemies
and
infidels
and
therefore
drew
near
with
the
sovereign
remedy
which
she
had
already
administered
with
such
success
as
she
approached
this
deplorable
object
of
pity
her
ears
were
surprised
with
an
ejaculation
in
the
english
tongue
which
he
fervently
pronounced
though
with
a
weak
and
languid
voice
recommending
his
soul
to
god
and
his
family
to
the
protection
of
heaven
our
amazon
purpose
was
staggered
by
this
providential
incident
the
sound
of
her
native
language
so
unexpectedly
heard
and
so
pathetically
delivered
had
a
surprising
effect
upon
her
imagination
and
the
faculty
of
reflection
did
not
forsake
her
in
such
emergency
though
she
could
not
recollect
the
features
of
this
unhappy
officer
she
concluded
from
his
appearance
that
he
was
some
person
of
distinction
in
the
service
and
foresaw
greater
advantage
to
herself
in
attempting
to
preserve
his
life
than
she
could
possibly
reap
from
the
execution
of
her
first
resolve
if
said
she
to
herself
i
can
find
means
of
conveying
him
to
his
tent
alive
he
can
not
but
in
conscience
acknowledge
my
humanity
with
some
considerable
recompense
and
should
he
chance
to
survive
his
wounds
i
have
everything
to
expect
from
his
gratitude
and
power
fraught
with
these
prudential
suggestions
she
drew
near
the
unfortunate
stranger
and
in
a
softened
accent
of
pity
and
condolence
questioned
him
concerning
his
name
condition
and
the
nature
of
his
mischance
at
the
same
time
making
a
gentle
tender
of
her
service
agreeably
surprised
to
hear
himself
accosted
in
such
a
manner
by
a
person
whose
equipage
seemed
to
promise
far
other
designs
he
thanked
her
in
the
most
grateful
terms
for
her
humanity
with
the
appellation
of
kind
countrywoman
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
was
colonel
of
a
regiment
of
horse
that
he
had
fallen
in
consequence
of
a
shot
he
received
in
his
breast
at
the
beginning
of
the
action
and
finally
entreated
her
to
procure
some
carriage
on
which
he
might
be
removed
to
his
tent
perceiving
him
faint
and
exhausted
with
loss
of
blood
she
raised
up
his
head
and
treated
him
with
that
cordial
which
was
her
constant
companion
at
that
instant
espying
a
small
body
of
hussars
returning
to
the
camp
with
the
plunder
they
had
taken
she
invoked
their
assistance
and
they
forthwith
carried
the
officer
to
his
own
quarters
where
his
wound
was
dressed
and
his
preserver
carefully
tended
him
until
his
recovery
was
completed
in
return
for
these
good
offices
this
gentleman
who
was
originally
of
scotland
rewarded
her
for
the
present
with
great
liberality
assured
her
of
his
influence
in
promoting
her
husband
and
took
upon
himself
the
charge
of
young
ferdinand
education
the
boy
was
immediately
taken
into
his
protection
and
entered
as
a
trooper
in
his
own
regiment
but
his
good
intentions
towards
his
were
frustrated
by
the
death
of
the
german
who
in
a
few
days
after
this
disposition
was
shot
in
the
trenches
before
temiswaer
this
event
over
and
above
the
conjugal
affliction
with
which
it
invaded
the
lady
quiet
would
have
involved
her
in
infinite
difficulty
and
distress
with
regard
to
her
temporal
concerns
by
leaving
her
unprotected
in
the
midst
of
strangers
had
not
she
been
thus
providentially
supplied
with
an
effectual
patron
in
the
colonel
who
was
known
by
the
appellation
of
count
melvil
he
no
sooner
saw
her
by
the
death
of
her
husband
detached
from
all
personal
connexions
with
a
military
life
than
he
proposed
that
she
should
quit
her
occupation
in
the
camp
and
retire
to
his
habitation
in
the
city
of
presburg
where
she
would
be
entertained
in
ease
and
plenty
during
the
remaining
part
of
her
natural
life
with
all
due
acknowledgments
of
his
generosity
she
begged
to
be
excused
from
embracing
his
proposal
alleging
she
was
so
much
accustomed
to
her
present
way
of
life
and
so
much
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
soldiery
that
she
should
never
be
happy
in
retirement
while
the
troops
of
any
prince
in
christendom
kept
the
field
the
count
finding
her
determined
to
prosecute
her
scheme
repeated
his
promise
of
befriending
her
upon
all
occasions
and
in
the
meantime
admitted
ferdinand
into
the
number
of
his
domestics
resolving
that
he
should
be
brought
up
in
attendance
upon
his
own
son
who
was
a
boy
of
the
same
age
he
kept
him
however
in
his
tent
until
he
should
have
an
opportunity
of
revisiting
his
family
in
person
and
before
that
occasion
offered
two
whole
years
elapsed
during
which
the
illustrious
prince
eugene
gained
the
celebrated
battle
of
belgrade
and
afterwards
made
himself
master
of
that
important
frontier
chapter
four
his
mother
prowess
and
death
together
with
some
instances
of
his
own
sagacity
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
mother
of
our
adventurer
such
as
she
hath
been
described
to
sit
quietly
in
her
tent
while
such
an
heroic
scene
was
acting
she
was
no
sooner
apprised
of
the
general
intention
to
attack
the
enemy
than
she
as
usual
packed
up
her
moveables
in
a
waggon
which
she
committed
to
the
care
of
a
peasant
in
the
neighbourhood
and
put
herself
in
motion
with
the
troops
big
with
the
expectation
of
that
part
in
which
she
had
formerly
acquitted
herself
so
much
to
her
nay
she
by
this
time
looked
upon
her
own
presence
as
a
certain
omen
of
success
to
the
cause
which
she
espoused
and
in
their
march
to
battle
actually
encouraged
the
ranks
with
repeated
declarations
importing
that
she
had
been
of
ten
decisive
engagements
in
all
of
which
her
friends
had
been
victorious
and
imputing
such
uncommon
good
fortune
to
some
supernatural
quality
inherent
in
her
person
whether
or
not
this
confidence
contributed
to
the
fortune
of
the
day
by
inspiring
the
soldiers
to
an
uncommon
pitch
of
courage
and
resolution
i
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
but
certain
it
is
the
victory
began
from
that
quarter
in
which
she
had
posted
herself
and
no
corps
in
the
army
behaved
with
such
intrepidity
as
that
which
was
manifested
by
those
who
were
favoured
with
her
admonitions
and
example
for
she
not
only
exposed
her
person
to
the
enemy
fire
with
the
indifference
and
deliberation
of
a
veteran
but
she
is
said
to
have
achieved
a
very
conspicuous
exploit
by
the
prowess
of
her
single
arm
the
extremity
of
the
line
to
which
she
had
attached
herself
being
assaulted
in
flank
by
a
body
of
the
spahis
wheeled
about
in
order
to
sustain
the
charge
and
received
them
with
such
a
seasonable
fire
as
brought
a
great
number
of
turbans
to
the
ground
among
those
who
fell
was
one
of
the
chiefs
or
agas
who
had
advanced
before
the
rest
with
a
view
to
signalise
his
valour
our
english
penthesilea
no
sooner
saw
this
turkish
leader
drop
than
struck
with
the
magnificence
of
his
own
and
horse
trappings
she
sprung
forward
to
seize
them
as
her
prize
and
found
the
aga
not
dead
though
in
a
good
measure
disabled
by
his
misfortune
which
was
entirely
owing
to
the
weight
of
his
horse
that
having
been
killed
by
a
lay
upon
his
leg
so
that
he
could
not
disengage
himself
nevertheless
perceiving
the
virago
approach
with
fell
intent
he
brandished
his
symitar
and
tried
to
intimidate
his
assailant
with
a
most
horrible
exclamation
but
it
was
not
the
dismal
yell
of
a
dismounted
cavalier
though
enforced
with
a
hideous
ferocity
of
countenance
and
the
menacing
gestures
with
which
he
waited
her
approach
that
could
intimidate
such
an
undaunted
she
saw
him
writhing
in
the
agonies
of
a
situation
from
which
he
could
not
move
and
running
towards
him
with
the
nimbleness
and
intrepidity
of
a
camilla
described
a
semicircle
in
the
progress
of
her
assault
and
attacking
him
on
one
side
plunged
her
dagger
in
his
throat
the
shades
of
death
encompassed
him
his
issued
at
the
wound
he
fell
prone
upon
the
earth
he
bit
the
dust
and
having
thrice
invoked
the
name
of
allah
straight
expired
while
his
destiny
was
thus
fulfilled
his
followers
began
to
reel
they
seemed
dismayed
at
the
fate
of
their
chief
beheld
their
companions
drop
like
the
leaves
in
autumn
and
suddenly
halted
in
the
midst
of
their
career
the
imperialists
observing
the
confusion
of
the
enemy
redoubled
their
fire
and
raising
a
dreadful
shout
advanced
in
order
to
improve
the
advantage
they
had
gained
the
spahis
durst
not
wait
the
shock
of
such
an
encounter
they
wheeled
to
the
and
clapping
spurs
to
their
horses
fled
in
the
utmost
disorder
this
was
actually
the
circumstance
that
turned
the
scale
of
battle
the
austrians
pursued
their
good
fortune
with
uncommon
impetuosity
and
in
a
few
minutes
left
the
field
clear
for
the
mother
of
our
hero
who
was
such
an
adept
in
the
art
of
stripping
that
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
bodies
of
the
aga
and
his
arabian
lay
naked
to
the
skin
it
would
have
been
happy
for
her
had
she
been
contented
with
these
reaped
from
the
fortune
of
the
day
and
retired
with
her
spoils
which
were
not
inconsiderable
but
intoxicated
with
the
glory
she
had
won
enticed
by
the
glittering
caparisons
that
lay
scattered
on
the
plain
and
without
doubt
prompted
by
the
secret
instinct
of
her
fate
she
resolved
to
seize
opportunity
by
the
forelock
and
once
for
all
indemnify
herself
for
the
many
fatigues
hazards
and
sorrows
she
had
undergone
thus
determined
she
reconnoitred
the
field
and
practised
her
address
so
successfully
that
in
less
than
half
an
hour
she
was
loaded
with
ermine
and
embroidery
and
disposed
to
retreat
with
her
burden
when
her
regards
were
solicited
by
a
splendid
bundle
which
she
descried
at
some
distance
lying
on
the
ground
this
was
no
other
than
an
unhappy
officer
of
hussars
who
after
having
the
good
fortune
to
take
a
turkish
standard
was
desperately
wounded
in
the
thigh
and
obliged
to
quit
his
horse
finding
himself
in
such
a
helpless
condition
he
had
wrapped
his
acquisition
round
his
body
that
whatever
might
happen
he
and
his
glory
should
not
be
parted
and
thus
shrouded
among
the
dying
and
the
dead
he
had
observed
the
progress
of
our
heroine
who
stalked
about
the
field
like
another
atropos
finishing
wherever
she
came
the
work
of
death
he
did
not
at
all
doubt
that
he
himself
would
be
visited
in
the
course
of
her
peregrinations
and
therefore
provided
for
her
reception
with
a
pistol
ready
cocked
in
his
hand
while
he
lay
perdue
beneath
his
covert
in
all
appearance
bereft
of
life
he
was
not
deceived
in
his
prognostic
she
no
sooner
eyed
the
golden
crescent
than
inflamed
with
curiosity
or
cupidity
she
directed
thitherward
her
steps
and
discerning
the
carcase
of
a
man
from
which
she
thought
there
would
be
a
necessity
for
disengaging
it
she
lifted
up
her
weapon
in
order
to
make
sure
of
her
purchase
and
in
the
very
instant
of
discharging
her
blow
received
a
brace
of
bullets
in
her
brain
thus
ended
the
mortal
pilgrimage
of
this
modern
amazon
who
in
point
of
courage
was
not
inferior
to
semiramis
tomyris
zenobia
thalestris
or
any
boasted
heroine
of
ancient
times
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
this
catastrophe
made
a
very
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
young
ferdinand
who
had
just
then
attained
the
ninth
year
of
his
age
and
been
for
a
considerable
time
weaned
from
her
maternal
caresses
especially
as
he
felt
no
wants
nor
grievances
in
the
family
of
the
count
who
favoured
him
with
a
particular
share
of
indulgence
because
he
perceived
in
him
a
spirit
of
docility
insinuation
and
sagacity
far
above
his
years
he
did
not
however
fail
to
lament
the
untimely
fate
of
his
mother
with
such
filial
expressions
of
sorrow
as
still
more
intimately
recommended
him
to
his
patron
who
being
himself
a
man
of
extraordinary
benevolence
looked
upon
the
boy
as
a
prodigy
of
natural
affection
and
foresaw
in
his
future
services
a
fund
of
gratitude
and
attachment
that
could
not
fail
to
render
him
a
valuable
acquisition
to
his
family
in
his
own
country
he
had
often
seen
connexions
of
that
sort
which
having
been
planted
in
the
infancy
of
the
adherent
had
grown
up
to
a
surprising
pitch
of
fidelity
and
friendship
that
no
temptation
could
bias
and
no
danger
dissolve
he
therefore
rejoiced
in
the
hope
of
seeing
his
own
son
accommodated
with
such
a
faithful
attendant
in
the
person
of
young
fathom
on
whom
he
resolved
to
bestow
the
same
education
he
had
planned
for
the
other
though
conveyed
in
such
a
manner
as
should
be
suitable
to
the
sphere
in
which
he
was
ordained
to
move
in
consequence
of
these
determinations
our
young
adventurer
led
a
very
easy
life
in
quality
of
page
to
the
count
in
whose
tent
he
lay
upon
a
pallet
close
to
his
and
often
diverted
him
with
his
childish
prattle
in
the
english
tongue
which
the
more
seldom
his
master
had
occasion
to
speak
he
the
more
delighted
to
hear
in
the
exercise
of
his
function
the
boy
was
incredibly
assiduous
and
alert
far
from
neglecting
the
little
particulars
of
his
duty
and
embarking
in
the
mischievous
amusements
of
the
children
belonging
to
the
camp
he
was
always
diligent
sedate
agreeably
officious
and
anticipating
and
in
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
seemed
to
express
the
most
vigilant
sense
of
his
goodness
and
generosity
nay
to
such
a
degree
had
these
sentiments
in
all
appearance
operated
upon
his
reflection
that
one
morning
while
he
supposed
the
count
asleep
he
crept
softly
to
his
bedside
and
gently
kissing
his
hand
which
happened
to
be
uncovered
pronounced
in
a
low
voice
a
most
fervent
prayer
in
his
behalf
beseeching
heaven
to
shower
down
blessings
upon
him
as
the
widow
friend
and
the
orphan
father
this
benediction
was
not
lost
upon
the
count
who
chanced
to
be
awake
and
heard
it
with
admiration
but
what
riveted
ferdinand
in
his
good
graces
was
a
discovery
that
our
youth
made
while
his
master
was
upon
duty
in
the
trenches
before
belgrade
two
foot
soldiers
standing
sentry
near
the
door
of
the
tent
were
captivated
with
the
sight
of
some
valuable
moveables
belonging
to
it
and
supposing
in
their
great
wisdom
that
the
city
of
belgrade
was
too
well
fortified
to
be
taken
during
that
campaign
they
came
to
a
resolution
of
withdrawing
themselves
from
the
severe
service
of
the
trenches
by
deserting
to
the
enemy
after
they
should
have
rifled
count
melvil
tent
of
the
furniture
by
which
they
were
so
powerfully
allured
the
particulars
of
this
plan
were
concerted
in
the
french
language
which
they
imagined
would
screen
them
from
all
risk
of
being
detected
in
case
they
should
be
overheard
though
as
there
was
no
living
creature
in
sight
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
person
was
privy
to
their
conversation
nevertheless
they
were
mistaken
in
both
these
conjectures
the
conference
reached
the
ears
of
fathom
who
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
tent
and
had
perceived
the
eager
looks
with
which
they
considered
some
parts
of
the
furniture
he
had
penetration
enough
to
suspect
their
desire
and
alarmed
by
that
suspicion
listened
attentively
to
their
discourse
which
from
a
slender
knowledge
in
the
french
tongue
he
had
the
good
fortune
partly
to
understand
this
important
piece
of
intelligence
he
communicated
to
the
count
at
his
return
and
measures
were
immediately
taken
to
defeat
the
design
and
make
an
example
of
the
authors
who
being
permitted
to
load
themselves
with
the
booty
were
apprehended
in
their
retreat
and
punished
with
death
according
to
their
demerits
chapter
five
a
brief
detail
of
his
education
nothing
could
have
more
seasonably
happened
to
confirm
the
good
opinion
which
the
colonel
entertained
of
ferdinand
principles
his
intentions
towards
the
boy
grew
every
day
more
and
more
warm
and
immediately
after
the
peace
of
passarowitz
he
retired
to
his
own
house
at
presburg
and
presented
young
fathom
to
his
lady
not
only
as
the
son
of
a
person
to
whom
he
owed
his
life
but
also
as
a
lad
who
merited
his
peculiar
protection
and
regard
by
his
own
personal
virtue
the
countess
who
was
an
hungarian
received
him
with
great
kindness
and
affability
and
her
son
was
ravished
with
the
prospect
of
enjoying
such
a
companion
in
short
fortune
seemed
to
have
provided
for
him
an
asylum
in
which
he
might
be
safely
trained
up
and
suitably
prepared
for
more
important
scenes
of
life
than
any
of
his
ancestors
had
ever
known
he
was
not
in
all
respects
entertained
on
the
footing
of
his
young
master
yet
he
shared
in
all
his
education
and
amusements
as
one
whom
the
old
gentleman
was
fully
determined
to
qualify
for
the
station
of
an
officer
in
the
service
and
if
he
did
not
eat
with
the
count
he
was
every
day
regaled
with
choice
bits
from
his
table
holding
as
it
were
a
middle
place
between
the
rank
of
a
relation
and
favourite
domestic
although
his
patron
maintained
a
tutor
in
the
house
to
superintend
the
conduct
of
his
heir
he
committed
the
charge
of
his
learning
to
the
instructions
of
a
public
school
where
he
imagined
the
boy
would
imbibe
a
laudable
spirit
of
emulation
among
his
fellows
which
could
not
fail
of
turning
out
to
the
advantage
of
his
education
ferdinand
was
entered
in
the
same
academy
and
the
two
lads
proceeded
equally
in
the
paths
of
erudition
a
mutual
friendship
and
intimacy
soon
ensued
and
notwithstanding
the
levity
and
caprice
commonly
discernible
in
the
behaviour
of
such
boys
very
few
or
rather
no
quarrels
happened
in
the
course
of
their
communication
yet
their
dispositions
were
altogether
different
and
their
talents
unlike
nay
this
dissimilarity
was
the
very
bond
of
their
union
because
it
prevented
that
jealousy
and
rivalship
which
often
interrupts
the
harmony
of
two
warm
contemporaries
the
young
count
made
extraordinary
progress
in
the
exercises
of
the
school
though
he
seemed
to
take
very
little
pains
in
the
cultivation
of
his
studies
and
became
a
perfect
hero
in
all
the
athletic
diversions
of
his
but
at
the
same
time
exhibited
such
a
bashful
appearance
and
uncouth
address
that
his
mother
despaired
of
ever
seeing
him
improved
into
any
degree
of
polite
behaviour
on
the
other
hand
fathom
who
was
in
point
of
learning
a
mere
dunce
became
even
in
his
childhood
remarkable
among
the
ladies
for
his
genteel
deportment
and
vivacity
they
admired
the
proficiency
he
made
under
the
directions
of
his
the
air
with
which
he
performed
his
obeisance
at
his
entrance
and
exit
and
were
charmed
with
the
agreeable
assurance
and
lively
sallies
of
his
conversation
while
they
expressed
the
utmost
concern
and
disgust
at
the
boorish
demeanour
of
his
companion
whose
extorted
bows
resembled
the
pawings
of
a
mule
who
hung
his
head
in
silence
like
a
detected
who
sat
in
company
under
the
most
awkward
expressions
of
constraint
and
whose
discourse
never
exceeded
the
simple
monosyllables
of
negation
and
assent
in
vain
did
all
the
females
of
the
family
propose
to
him
young
fathom
as
a
pattern
and
reproach
he
remained
unaltered
by
all
their
efforts
and
expostulations
and
allowed
our
adventurer
to
enjoy
the
triumph
of
his
praise
while
he
himself
was
conscious
of
his
own
superiority
in
those
qualifications
which
seemed
of
more
real
importance
than
the
mere
exteriors
and
forms
of
life
his
present
ambition
was
not
to
make
a
figure
at
his
father
table
but
to
eclipse
his
rivals
at
school
and
to
acquire
an
influence
and
authority
among
these
confederates
nevertheless
fathom
might
possibly
have
fallen
under
his
displeasure
or
contempt
had
not
that
pliant
genius
found
means
to
retain
his
friendship
by
seasonable
compliances
and
submission
for
the
sole
study
or
at
least
the
chief
aim
of
ferdinand
was
to
make
himself
necessary
and
agreeable
to
those
on
whom
his
dependence
was
placed
his
talent
was
in
this
particular
suited
to
his
inclination
he
seemed
to
have
inherited
it
from
his
mother
womb
and
without
all
doubt
would
have
raised
upon
it
a
most
admirable
superstructure
of
fortune
and
applause
had
not
it
been
inseparably
yoked
with
a
most
insidious
principle
of
that
grew
up
with
him
from
the
cradle
and
left
no
room
in
his
heart
for
the
least
particle
of
social
virtue
this
last
however
he
knew
so
well
how
to
counterfeit
by
means
of
a
large
share
of
ductility
and
dissimulation
that
surely
he
was
calculated
by
nature
to
dupe
even
the
most
cautious
and
gratify
his
appetites
by
levying
contributions
on
all
mankind
so
little
are
the
common
instructors
of
youth
qualified
to
judge
the
capacities
of
those
who
are
under
their
tutelage
and
care
that
fathom
by
dint
of
his
insinuating
arts
made
shift
to
pass
upon
the
schoolmaster
as
a
lad
of
quick
parts
in
despite
of
a
natural
inaptitude
to
retain
his
lessons
which
all
his
industry
could
never
overcome
in
order
to
remedy
or
rather
to
cloak
this
defect
in
his
understanding
he
had
always
recourse
to
the
friendship
of
the
young
count
who
freely
permitted
him
to
transcribe
his
exercises
until
a
small
accident
happened
which
had
put
a
stop
to
these
instances
of
his
the
adventure
inconsiderable
as
it
is
we
shall
record
as
the
first
overt
act
of
ferdinand
true
character
as
well
as
an
illustration
of
the
opinion
we
have
advanced
touching
the
blind
and
injudicious
decisions
of
a
right
pedagogue
among
other
tasks
imposed
by
the
pedant
upon
the
form
to
which
our
two
companions
belonged
they
were
one
evening
ordered
to
translate
a
chapter
of
caesar
commentaries
accordingly
the
young
count
went
to
work
and
performed
the
undertaking
with
great
elegance
and
despatch
fathom
having
spent
the
night
in
more
effeminate
amusements
was
next
morning
so
much
hurried
for
want
of
time
that
in
his
transcription
he
neglected
to
insert
a
few
variations
from
the
text
these
being
the
terms
on
which
he
was
allowed
to
use
it
so
that
it
was
verbatim
a
copy
of
the
original
as
those
exercises
were
always
delivered
in
a
heap
subscribed
with
the
several
names
of
the
boys
to
whom
they
belonged
the
schoolmaster
chanced
to
peruse
the
version
of
ferdinand
before
he
looked
into
any
of
the
rest
and
could
not
help
bestowing
upon
it
particular
marks
of
approbation
the
next
that
fell
under
his
examination
was
that
of
the
young
count
when
he
immediately
perceived
the
sameness
and
far
from
imputing
it
to
the
true
cause
upbraided
him
with
having
copied
the
exercise
of
our
adventurer
and
insisted
upon
chastising
him
upon
the
spot
for
his
want
of
application
had
not
the
young
gentleman
thought
his
honour
was
concerned
he
would
have
submitted
to
the
punishment
without
murmuring
but
he
inherited
from
his
parents
the
pride
of
two
fierce
nations
and
being
overwhelmed
with
reproaches
for
that
which
he
imagined
ought
to
have
redounded
to
his
glory
he
could
not
brook
the
indignity
and
boldly
affirmed
that
he
himself
was
the
original
to
whom
ferdinand
was
beholden
for
his
performance
the
schoolmaster
nettled
to
find
himself
mistaken
in
his
judgment
resolved
that
the
count
should
have
no
cause
to
exult
in
the
discovery
he
had
made
and
like
a
true
flogger
actually
whipped
him
for
having
allowed
fathom
to
copy
his
exercise
nay
in
the
hope
of
vindicating
his
own
penetration
he
took
an
opportunity
of
questioning
ferdinand
in
private
concerning
the
circumstances
of
the
translation
and
our
hero
perceiving
his
drift
gave
him
such
artful
and
ambiguous
answers
as
persuaded
him
that
the
young
count
had
acted
the
part
of
a
plagiary
and
that
the
other
had
been
restrained
from
doing
himself
justice
by
the
consideration
of
his
own
dependence
this
profound
director
did
not
fail
in
honour
of
his
own
discernment
to
whisper
about
the
misrepresentation
as
an
instance
of
the
young
insolence
and
fathom
humility
and
good
sense
the
story
was
circulated
among
the
servants
especially
the
maids
belonging
to
the
family
whose
favour
our
hero
had
acquired
by
his
engaging
behaviour
and
at
length
it
reached
the
ears
of
his
patron
who
incensed
at
his
presumption
and
inhospitality
called
him
to
a
severe
account
when
the
young
gentleman
absolutely
denied
the
truth
of
the
allegation
and
appealed
to
the
evidence
of
fathom
himself
our
adventurer
was
accordingly
summoned
by
the
father
and
encouraged
to
declare
the
truth
with
an
assurance
of
his
constant
protection
upon
which
ferdinand
very
wisely
fell
upon
his
knees
and
while
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
acquitted
the
young
count
of
the
imputation
and
expressed
his
apprehension
that
the
report
had
been
spread
by
some
of
his
enemies
who
wanted
to
prejudice
him
in
the
opinion
of
his
patron
the
old
gentleman
was
not
satisfied
of
his
son
integrity
by
this
declaration
being
naturally
of
a
generous
disposition
highly
prepossessed
in
favour
of
the
poor
orphan
and
chagrined
at
the
unpromising
appearance
of
his
heir
he
suspected
that
fathom
was
overawed
by
the
fear
of
giving
offence
and
that
notwithstanding
what
he
had
said
the
case
really
stood
as
it
had
been
represented
in
this
persuasion
he
earnestly
exhorted
his
son
to
resist
and
combat
with
any
impulse
he
might
feel
within
himself
tending
to
selfishness
fraud
or
imposition
to
encourage
every
sentiment
of
candour
and
benevolence
and
to
behave
with
moderation
and
affability
to
all
his
he
laid
upon
him
strong
injunctions
not
without
a
mixture
of
threats
to
consider
fathom
as
the
object
of
his
peculiar
regard
to
respect
him
as
the
son
of
the
count
preserver
as
a
briton
a
stranger
and
above
all
an
helpless
orphan
to
whom
the
rights
of
hospitality
were
doubly
due
such
admonitions
were
not
lost
upon
the
youth
who
under
the
rough
husk
of
his
personal
exhibition
possessed
a
large
share
of
generous
sensibility
without
any
formal
professions
to
his
father
he
resolved
to
govern
himself
according
to
his
remonstrances
and
far
from
conceiving
the
least
spark
of
animosity
against
fathom
he
looked
upon
the
poor
boy
as
the
innocent
cause
of
his
disgrace
and
redoubled
his
kindness
towards
him
that
his
honour
might
never
again
be
called
in
question
upon
the
same
subject
nothing
is
more
liable
to
misconstruction
than
an
act
of
uncommon
generosity
one
half
of
the
world
mistake
the
motive
from
want
of
ideas
to
conceive
an
instance
of
beneficence
that
soars
so
high
above
the
level
of
their
own
sentiments
and
the
rest
suspect
it
of
something
sinister
or
selfish
from
the
suggestions
of
their
own
sordid
and
vicious
inclinations
the
young
count
subjected
himself
to
such
misinterpretation
among
those
who
observed
the
increased
warmth
of
civility
and
complaisance
in
his
behaviour
to
ferdinand
they
ascribed
it
to
his
desire
of
still
profiting
by
our
adventurer
superior
talents
by
which
alone
they
supposed
him
enabled
to
maintain
any
degree
of
reputation
at
school
or
to
the
fear
of
being
convicted
by
him
of
some
misdemeanour
of
which
he
knew
himself
guilty
these
suspicions
were
not
effaced
by
the
conduct
of
ferdinand
who
when
examined
on
the
subject
managed
his
answers
in
such
a
manner
as
confirmed
their
conjectures
while
he
pretended
to
refute
them
and
at
the
same
time
acquired
to
himself
credit
for
his
extraordinary
discretion
and
if
he
exhibited
such
a
proof
of
sagacity
in
the
twelfth
year
of
his
age
what
might
not
be
expected
from
his
finesse
in
the
maturity
of
his
faculties
and
experience
thus
secured
in
the
good
graces
of
the
whole
family
he
saw
the
days
of
his
puerility
glide
along
in
the
most
agreeable
elapse
of
caresses
and
amusement
he
never
fairly
plunged
into
the
stream
of
but
by
floating
on
the
surface
imbibed
a
small
tincture
of
those
different
sciences
which
his
master
pretended
to
teach
in
short
he
resembled
those
vagrant
swallows
that
skim
along
the
level
of
some
pool
or
river
without
venturing
to
wet
one
feather
in
their
wings
except
in
the
accidental
pursuit
of
an
inconsiderable
fly
yet
though
his
capacity
or
inclination
was
unsuited
for
studies
of
this
kind
he
did
not
fail
to
manifest
a
perfect
genius
in
the
acquisition
of
other
more
profitable
arts
over
and
above
the
accomplishments
of

for
which
he
hath
been
already
celebrated

began
even
at
these
years
to
understand
the
moves
and
schemes
of

and
made
himself
a
mere
adept
in
the
mystery
of
cards
which
he
learned
in
the
course
of
his
assiduities
and
attention
to

it
was
in

that
he
attracted

and
friendship
of

daughter
a
girl
by
two
years
older
than
himself
who
was
not
insensible
to
his
qualifications
and
looked
upon
him
with
the
most
favourable
eyes
of
prepossession
whether
or
not
he
at
this
period
of
his
life
began
to
project
plans
for
availing
himself
of
her
susceptibility
is
uncertain
but
without
all
doubt
he
cultivated
her
esteem
with
as
obsequious
and
submissive
attention
as
if
he
had
already
formed
the
design
which
in
his
advanced
age
he
attempted
to
put
in
execution
divers
circumstances
conspired
to
promote

in
the
favour
of
this
young
lady
the
greenness
of
his
years
secured
him
from
any
appearance
of
fallacious
aim
so
that
he
was
indulged
in
frequent
opportunities
of
conversing
with
his
young
mistress
whose
parents
encouraged
this
communication
by
which
they
hoped
she
would
improve
in

the

of
her
father
such

his
talents
calculated
for
the
meridian
of
those
parties
and
his
manners
so
engaging
that
there
would
have
been
no
just
subject
for
wonder
had
he
made
an
impression
upon
the
tender
unexperienced
heart
of
mademoiselle
de
melvil
whose
beauty
was
not
so
attractive
as
to
extinguish
his
hope
in
raising
up
a
number
of
formidable
rivals
though
her
expectations
of
fortune
were
such
as
commonly
lend
additional
lustre
to
personal
merit
all
these
considerations
were
so
many
steps
towards
the
success
of
ferdinand
pretensions
and
though
he
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
perceived
them
at
first
he
in
the
sequel
seemed
perfectly
well
apprised
of
his
advantages
and
used
them
to
the
full
extent
of
his
faculties
observing
that
she
delighted
in
music
he
betook
himself
to
the
study
of
that
art
and
by
dint
of
application
and
a
tolerable
ear
learned
of
himself
to
accompany
her
with
a
german
flute
while
she
sung
and
played
upon
the
harpsichord
the
count
seeing
his
inclination
and
the
progress
he
had
made
resolved
that
his
capacity
should
not
be
lost
for
want
of
cultivation
and
accordingly
provided
him
with
a
master
by
whom
he
was
instructed
in
the
principles
of
the
art
and
soon
became
a
proficient
in
playing
upon
the
violin
in
the
practice
of
these
improvements
and
avocations
and
in
attendance
upon
his
young
master
whom
he
took
care
never
to
disoblige
or
neglect
he
attained
to
the
age
of
sixteen
without
feeling
the
least
abatement
in
the
friendship
and
generosity
of
those
upon
whom
he
depended
but
on
the
contrary
receiving
every
day
fresh
marks
of
their
bounty
and
regard
he
had
before
this
time
been
smit
with
the
ambition
of
making
a
conquest
of
the
young
lady
heart
and
foresaw
manifold
advantages
to
himself
in
becoming
to
count
melvil
who
he
never
doubted
would
soon
be
reconciled
to
the
match
if
once
it
could
be
effectuated
without
his
knowledge
although
he
thought
he
had
great
reason
to
believe
that
mademoiselle
looked
upon
him
with
an
eye
of
peculiar
favour
his
disposition
was
happily
tempered
with
an
ingredient
of
caution
that
hindered
him
from
acting
with
precipitation
and
he
had
discerned
in
the
young
lady
deportment
certain
indications
of
loftiness
and
pride
which
kept
him
in
the
utmost
vigilance
and
circumspection
for
he
knew
that
by
a
premature
declaration
he
should
run
the
risk
of
forfeiting
all
the
advantages
he
had
gained
and
blasting
those
expectations
that
now
blossomed
so
gaily
in
his
heart
restricted
by
these
reflections
he
acted
at
a
wary
distance
and
determined
to
proceed
by
the
method
of
sap
and
summoning
all
his
artifice
and
attractions
to
his
aid
employed
them
under
the
insidious
cover
of
profound
respect
in
order
to
undermine
those
bulwarks
of
haughtiness
or
discretion
which
otherwise
might
have
rendered
his
approaches
to
her
impracticable
with
a
view
to
enhance
the
value
of
his
company
and
sound
her
sentiments
at
the
same
time
he
became
more
reserved
than
usual
and
seldomer
engaged
in
her
parties
of
music
and
cards
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
reserve
he
never
failed
in
those
demonstrations
of
reverence
and
regard
which
he
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
express
but
devised
such
excuses
for
his
absence
as
she
could
not
help
admitting
in
consequence
of
this
affected
shyness
she
more
than
once
gently
chid
him
for
his
neglect
and
indifference
observing
with
an
ironical
air
that
he
was
now
too
much
of
a
man
to
be
entertained
with
such
effeminate
diversions
but
her
reproofs
were
pronounced
with
too
much
ease
and
to
be
agreeable
to
our
hero
who
desired
to
see
her
ruffled
and
chagrined
at
his
absence
and
to
hear
himself
rebuked
with
an
angry
affectation
of
disdain
this
effort
therefore
he
reinforced
with
the
most
captivating
carriage
he
could
assume
in
those
hours
which
he
now
so
sparingly
bestowed
upon
his
mistress
he
regaled
her
with
all
the
entertaining
stories
he
could
learn
or
invent
particularly
such
as
he
thought
would
justify
and
recommend
the
levelling
power
of
love
that
knows
no
distinctions
of
fortune
he
sung
nothing
but
tender
airs
and
passionate
complaints
composed
by
desponding
or
despairing
swains
and
to
render
his
performances
of
this
kind
the
more
pathetic
interlarded
them
with
some
seasonable
sighs
while
the
tears
which
he
had
ever
at
command
stood
collected
in
either
eye
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
overlook
such
studied
emotions
she
in
a
jocose
manner
taxed
him
with
having
lost
his
heart
rallied
the
excess
of
his
passion
and
in
a
merry
strain
undertook
to
be
an
advocate
for
his
love
her
behaviour
was
still
wide
of
his
wish
and
expectation
he
thought
she
would
in
consequence
of
her
discovery
have
betrayed
some
interested
symptom
that
her
face
would
have
undergone
some
favourable
suffusion
that
her
tongue
would
have
faltered
her
breast
heaved
and
her
whole
deportment
betokened
internal
agitation
and
disorder
in
which
case
he
meant
to
profit
by
the
happy
impression
and
declare
himself
before
she
could
possibly
recollect
the
dictates
of
her
baffled
however
in
his
endeavours
by
the
serenity
of
the
young
lady
which
he
still
deemed
equivocal
he
had
recourse
to
another
experiment
by
which
he
believed
he
should
make
a
discovery
of
her
sentiments
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
one
day
while
he
accompanied
mademoiselle
in
her
exercise
of
music
he
pretended
all
of
a
sudden
to
be
taken
ill
and
counterfeited
a
swoon
in
her
apartment
surprised
at
this
accident
she
screamed
aloud
but
far
from
running
to
his
assistance
with
the
transports
and
distraction
of
a
lover
she
ordered
her
maid
who
was
present
to
support
his
head
and
went
in
person
to
call
for
more
help
he
was
accordingly
removed
to
his
own
chamber
where
willing
to
be
still
more
certified
of
her
inclinations
he
prolonged
the
farce
and
lay
groaning
under
the
pretence
of
a
severe
fever
the
whole
family
was
alarmed
upon
this
occasion
for
as
we
have
already
observed
he
was
an
universal
favourite
he
was
immediately
visited
by
the
old
count
and
his
lady
who
expressed
the
utmost
concern
at
his
distemper
ordered
him
to
be
carefully
attended
and
sent
for
a
physician
without
loss
of
time
the
young
gentleman
would
scarce
stir
from
his
bedside
where
he
ministered
unto
him
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
brotherly
affection
and
miss
exhorted
him
to
keep
up
his
spirits
with
many
expressions
of
unreserved
sympathy
and
regard
nevertheless
he
saw
nothing
in
her
behaviour
but
what
might
be
naturally
expected
from
common
friendship
and
a
compassionate
disposition
and
was
very
much
mortified
at
his
disappointment
whether
the
miscarriage
actually
affected
his
constitution
or
the
doctor
happened
to
be
mistaken
in
his
diagnostics
we
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
but
the
patient
was
certainly
treated
secundum
artem
and
all
his
complaints
in
a
little
time
realised
for
the
physician
like
a
true
graduate
had
an
eye
to
the
apothecary
in
his
prescriptions
and
such
was
the
concern
and
scrupulous
care
with
which
our
hero
was
attended
that
the
orders
of
the
faculty
were
performed
with
the
utmost
punctuality
he
was

as
well
skilled
in

arts

their
occupation
as
any
other
leeches

sun
and
swallowed
a
whole
dispensary
of
bolusses
draughts
and
apozems
by
which
means
he
became
fairly
delirious
in
three
days
and
so
untractable
that
he
could
be
no
longer
managed
according
to
rule
otherwise
in
all
likelihood
the
world
would
never
have
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
these
adventures
in

his
constitution
though
unable
to
cope
with
two
such
formidable
antagonists
as
the
doctor
and
the
disease
he
had
conjured
up
was
no
sooner
rid
of
the
one
than
it
easily
got
the
better
of
the
other
and
though
ferdinand
after
all
found
his
grand
aim
unaccomplished
his
malady
was
productive
of
a
consequence
which
though
he
had
not
foreseen
it
he
did
not
fail
to
convert
to
his
own
use
and
advantage

had
in

sooth
long
sighed
in

practised

attract

admiration
and
ensnare

loves
but
all
his
faculties
were
employed
upon
the
plan
which
he
had
already
projected
that
was
the
goal
of
his
whole
attention
to
which
all
his
measures
tended
and
whether
or
not
he
perceived
the
impression
he
had
made
upon
teresa
he
never
gave
her
the
least
reason
to
believe
he
was
conscious
of
his
victory
until
he
found
himself
baffled
in
his
design
upon
the
heart
of
her
she
therefore
persevered
in
her
distant
attempts
to
allure
him
with
the
usual
coquetries
of
dress
and
address
and
in
the
sweet
hope
of
profiting
by
his
susceptibility
made
shift
to
suppress
her
feelings
and
keep
her
passion
within
bounds
until
his
supposed
danger
alarmed
her
fears
and
raised
such
a
tumult
within
her
breast
that
she
could
no
longer
conceal
her
love
but
gave
a
loose
to
her
sorrow
in
the
most
immoderate
expressions
of
anguish
and
affliction
and
while
his
delirium
lasted
behaved
with
all
the
agitation
of
a
despairing
shepherdess
ferdinand
was
or
pretended
to
be
the
last
person
in
the
family
who
understood
the
situation
of
her
thoughts
when
he
perceived
her
passion
he
entered
into
deliberation
with
himself
and
tasked
his
reflection
and
foresight
in
order
to
discover
how
best
he
might
convert
this
conquest
to
his
own
advantage
here
then
that
we
may
neglect
no
opportunity
of
doing
justice
to
our
hero
it
will
be
proper
to
observe
that
howsoever
unapt
his
understanding
might
be
to
receive
and
retain
the
usual
culture
of
the
schools
he
was
naturally
a
genius
in
point
of
sagacity
and
he
dived
into
the
characters
of
mankind
with
a
penetration
peculiar
to
himself
and
had
he
been
admitted
as
a
pupil
in
any
political
academy
would
have
certainly
become
one
of
the
ablest
statesmen
in
europe
having
revolved
all
the
probable
consequences
of
such
a
connexion
he
determined
to
prosecute
an
amour
with
the
lady
whose
affection
he
had
subdued
because
he
hoped
to
interest
her
as
an
auxiliary
in
his
grand
scheme
upon
mademoiselle
which
he
did
not
as
yet
think
proper
to
lay
aside
for
he
was
not
more
ambitious
in
the
plan
than
indefatigable
in
the
prosecution
of
it
he
knew
it
would
be
impossible
to
execute
his
aims
upon
the
count
daughter
under
the
eye
of
teresa
whose
natural
discernment
would
be
whetted
with
jealousy
and
who
would
watch
his
conduct
and
thwart
his
progress
with
all
the
vigilance
and
spite
of
a
slighted
maiden
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
doubt
of
being
able
to
bring
her
over
to
his
interest
by
the
influence
he
had
already
gained
or
might
afterwards
acquire
over
her
passions
in
which
case
she
would
effectually
espouse
his
cause
and
employ
her
good
offices
with
her
mistress
in
his
behalf
besides
he
was
induced
by
another
motive
which
though
secondary
did
not
fail
in
this
case
to
have
an
effect
upon
his
determination
he
looked
upon
teresa
with
the
eyes
of
appetite
which
he
longed
to
gratify
for
he
was
not
at
all
dead
to
the
instigations
of
the
flesh
though
he
had
philosophy
enough
to
resist
them
when
he
thought
they
interfered
with
his
interest
here
the
case
was
quite
different
his
desire
happened
to
be
upon
the
side
of
his
advantage
and
therefore
resolving
to
indulge
it
he
no
sooner
found
himself
in
a
condition
to
manage
such
an
adventure
than
he
began
to
make
gradual
advances
in
point
of
warmth
and
particular
complacency
to
the
maid
he
first
of
all
thanked
her
in
the
most
grateful
terms
for
the
concern
she
had
manifested
at
his
distemper
and
the
kind
services
he
had
received
from
her
during
the
course
of
it
he
treated
her
upon
all
occasions
with
unusual
affability
and
regard
assiduously
courted
her
acquaintance
and
conversation
and
contracted
an
intimacy
that
in
a
little
time
produced
a
declaration
of
love
although
her
heart
was
too
much
intendered
to
hold
out
against
all
the
forms
of
assault
far
from
yielding
at
discretion
she
stood
upon
honourable
terms
with
great
obstinacy
of
punctilio
and
while
she
owned
he
was
master
of
her
inclinations
gave
him
to
understand
with
a
peremptory
and
resolute
air
that
he
should
never
make
a
conquest
of
her
virtue
observing
that
if
the
passion
he
professed
was
genuine
he
would
not
scruple
to
give
such
a
proof
of
it
as
would
at
once
convince
her
of
his
sincerity
and
that
he
could
have
no
just
cause
to
refuse
her
that
satisfaction
she
being
his
equal
in
point
of
birth
and
situation
for
if
he
was
the
companion
and
favourite
of
the
young
count
she
was
the
friend
and
confidant
of
mademoiselle
he
acknowledged
the
strength
of
her
argument
and
that
her
condescension
was
greater
than
his
deserts
but
objected
against
the
proposal
as
infinitely
prejudicial
to
the
fortunes
of
them
both
he
represented
the
state
of
dependence
in
which
they
mutually
stood
their
utter
incapacity
to
support
one
another
under
the
consequences
of
a
precipitate
match
clandestinely
made
without
the
consent
and
concurrence
of
their
patrons
he
displayed
with
great
eloquence
all
those
gay
expectations
they
had
reason
to
entertain
from
that
eminent
degree
of
favour
which
they
had
already
secured
in
the
family
and
set
forth
in
the
most
alluring
colours
those
enchanting
scenes
of
pleasure
they
might
enjoy
in
each
other
without
that
disagreeable
consciousness
of
a
nuptial
chain
provided
she
would
be
his
associate
in
the
execution
of
a
plan
which
he
had
projected
for
their
reciprocal
convenience
having
thus
inflamed
her
love
of
pleasure
and
curiosity
he
with
great
caution
hinted
his
design
upon
the
young
lady
fortune
and
perceiving
her
listening
with
the
most
greedy
attention
and
perfectly
ripe
for
the
conspiracy
he
disclosed
his
intention
at
full
length
assuring
her
with
the
most
solemn
protestations
of
love
and
attachment
that
could
he
once
make
himself
legal
possessor
of
an
estate
which
mademoiselle
inherited
by
the
will
of
a
deceased
aunt
his
dear
teresa
should
reap
the
happy
fruits
of
his
affluence
and
wholly
engross
his
time
and
attention
such
a
base
declaration
our
hero
would
not
have
ventured
to
make
had
he
not
implicitly
believed
the
damsel
was
as
great
a
latitudinarian
as
himself
in
point
of
morals
and
principle
and
been
well
assured
that
though
he
should
be
mistaken
in
her
way
of
thinking
so
far
as
to
be
threatened
with
a
detection
of
his
purpose
he
would
always
have
it
in
his
power
to
refute
her
accusation
as
mere
calumny
by
the
character
he
had
hitherto
maintained
and
the
circumspection
of
his
future
conduct
he
seldom
or
never
erred
in
his
observations
on
the
human
heart
teresa
instead
of
disapproving
relished
the
plan
in
general
with
demonstrations
of
singular
satisfaction
she
at
once
conceived
all
the
advantageous
consequences
of
such
a
scheme
and
perceived
in
it
only
one
flaw
which
however
she
did
not
think
incurable
this
defect
was
no
other
than
a
sufficient
bond
of
union
by
which
they
might
be
effectually
tied
down
to
their
mutual
interest
she
foresaw
that
in
case
ferdinand
should
obtain
possession
of
the
prize
he
might
with
great
ease
deny
their
contract
and
disavow
her
claim
of
participation
she
therefore
demanded
security
and
proposed
as
a
preliminary
of
the
agreement
that
he
should
privately
take
her
to
wife
with
a
view
to
dispel
all
her
apprehensions
of
his
inconstancy
or
deceit
as
such
a
previous
engagement
would
be
a
check
upon
his
behaviour
and
keep
him
strictly
to
the
letter
of
their
contract
he
could
not
help
subscribing
to
the
righteousness
of
this
proposal
which
nevertheless
he
would
have
willingly
waived
on
the
supposition
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
joined
in
the
bands
of
wedlock
with
such
secrecy
as
the
nature
of
the
case
absolutely
required
this
would
have
been
a
difficulty
soon
removed
had
the
scene
of
the
transaction
been
laid
in
the
metropolis
of
england
where
passengers
are
plied
in
the
streets
by
clergymen
who
prostitute
their
characters
and
consciences
for
hire
in
defiance
of
all
decency
and
law
but
in
the
kingdom
of
hungary
ecclesiastics
are
more
scrupulous
in
the
exercise
of
their
function
and
the
objection
was
or
supposed
to
be
altogether
insurmountable
so
that
they
were
fain
to
have
recourse
to
an
expedient
with
which
after
some
hesitation
our
was
satisfied
they
joined
hands
in
the
sight
of
heaven
which
they
called
to
witness
and
to
judge
the
sincerity
of
their
vows
and
engaged
in
a
voluntary
oath
to
confirm
their
union
by
the
sanction
of
the
church
whenever
a
convenient
opportunity
for
so
doing
should
occur
the
scruples
of
teresa
being
thus
removed
she
admitted
ferdinand
to
the
privileges
of
a
husband
which
he
enjoyed
in
stolen
interviews
and
readily
undertook
to
exert
her
whole
power
in
promoting
his
suit
with
her
young
mistress
because
she
now
considered
his
interest
as
inseparably
connected
with
her
own
surely
nothing
could
be
more
absurd
or
preposterous
than
the
articles
of
this
covenant
which
she
insisted
upon
with
such
inflexibility
how
could
she
suppose
that
her
pretended
lover
would
be
restrained
by
an
oath
when
the
very
occasion
of
incurring
it
was
an
intention
to
act
in
violation
of
all
laws
human
and
divine
and
yet
such
ridiculous
conjuration
is
commonly
the
cement
of
every
conspiracy
how
dark
how
treacherous
how
impious
soever
it
may
be
a
certain
sign
that
there
are
some
remains
of
religion
left
in
the
human
mind
even
after
every
moral
sentiment
hath
abandoned
it
and
that
the
most
execrable
ruffian
finds
means
to
quiet
the
suggestions
of
his
conscience
by
some
reversionary
hope
of
heaven

think
impertinent

it
will
our
lovers

real

amidst
the
first
transports
of
their
enjoyment
did
not

the
great
political
aim
of
their
conjunction
teresa
bedchamber
to
which
our
hero
constantly
repaired
at
midnight
was
the
scene
of
their
deliberations
and
there
it
was
determined
that
the
damsel
in
order
to
avoid
suspicion
should
feign
herself
irritated
at
the
indifference
of
ferdinand
her
passion
for
whom
was
by
this
time
no
secret
in
the
family
and
that
with
a
view
to
countenance
this
affectation
he
should
upon
all
occasions
treat
her
with
an
air
of
loftiness
and
disdain
so
screened
from
all
imputation
of
fraud
she
was
furnished
by
him
with
artful
instructions
how
to
sound
the
inclinations
of
her
young
mistress
how
to
recommend
his
person
and
qualifications
by
the
sure
methods
of
contradiction
comparisons
revilings
and
reproach
how
to
watch
the
paroxysms
of
her
disposition
inflame
her
passions
and
improve
for
his
advantage
those
moments
of
frailty
from
which
no
woman
is
exempted
in
short
this
consummate
politician
taught
his
agent
to
poison
the
young
lady
mind
with
insidious
conversation
tending
to
inspire
her
with
the
love
of
guilty
pleasure
to
debauch
her
sentiments
and
confound
her
ideas
of
dignity
and
virtue
after
all
the
task
is
not
difficult
to
lead
the
unpractised
heart
astray
by
dint
of
those
opportunities
her
seducer
possessed
the
seeds
of
insinuation
seasonably
sown
upon
the
warm
luxuriant
soil
of
youth
could
hardly
fail
of
shooting
up
into
such
intemperate
desires
as
he
wanted
to
produce
especially
when
cultured
and
cherished
in
her
unguarded
hours
by
that
stimulating
discourse
which
familiarity
admits
and
the
looser
passions
ingrafted
in
every
breast
are
apt
to
relish
and
excuse
fathom
had
previously
reconnoitred
the
ground
and
discovered
some
marks
of
inflammability
in
mademoiselle
constitution
her
beauty
was
not
such
as
to
engage
her
in
those
gaieties
of
amusement
which
could
flatter
her
vanity
and
dissipate
her
ideas
and
she
was
of
an
age
when
the
little
loves
and
young
desires
take
possession
of
the
fancy
he
therefore
concluded
that
she
had
the
more
leisure
to
indulge
these
enticing
images
of
pleasure
that
youth
never
fails
to
create
particularly
in
those
who
like
her
were
addicted
to
solitude
and
study
teresa
full
fraught
with
the
wily
injunctions
of
her
confederate
took
the
field
and
opened
the
campaign
with
such
remarkable
sourness
in
her
aspect
when
ferdinand
appeared
that
her
young
lady
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
her
affected
chagrin
and
asked
the
reason
of
such
apparent
alteration
in
her
way
of
thinking
prepared
for
this
question
the
other
replied
in
a
manner
calculated
for
giving
mademoiselle
to
understand
that
whatever
impressions
ferdinand
might
have
formerly
made
on
her
heart
they
were
now
altogether
effaced
by
the
pride
and
insolence
with
which
he
had
received
her
advances
and
that
her
breast
now
glowed
with
all
the
revenge
of
a
slighted
lover
to
evince
the
sincerity
of
this
declaration
she
bitterly
inveighed
against
him
and
even
affected
to
depreciate
those
talents
in
which
she
knew
his
chief
merit
to
consist
hoping
by
these
means
to
interest
mademoiselle
candour
in
his
defence
so
far
the
train
succeeded
that
young
lady
love
for
truth
was
offended
at
the
calumnies
that
were
vented
against
ferdinand
in
his
absence
she
chid
her
woman
for
the
rancour
of
her
remarks
and
undertook
to
refute
the
articles
of
his
dispraise
teresa
supported
her
own
assertions
with
great
obstinacy
and
a
dispute
ensued
in
which
her
mistress
was
heated
into
some
extravagant
commendations
of
our
adventurer
his
supposed
enemy
did
not
fail
to
make
a
report
of
her
success
and
to
magnify
every
advantage
they
had
gained
believing
in
good
earnest
that
her
lady
warmth
was
the
effect
of
a
real
passion
for
the
fortunate
fathom
but
he
himself
viewed
the
adventure
in
a
different
light
and
rightly
imputed
the
violence
of
mademoiselle
behaviour
to
the
contradiction
she
had
sustained
from
her
maid
or
to
the
fire
of
her
natural
generosity
glowing
in
behalf
of
innocence
traduced
nevertheless
he
was
perfectly
well
pleased
with
the
nature
of
the
contest
because
in
the
course
of
such
debates
he
foresaw
that
he
should
become
habitually
her
hero
and
that
in
time
she
would
actually
believe
those
exaggerations
of
his
merit
which
she
herself
had
feigned
for
the
honour
of
her
own
arguments
this
presage
founded
upon
that
principle
of
without
which
no
individual
exists
may
certainly
be
justified
by
manifold
occurrences
in
life
we
ourselves
have
known
a
very
pregnant
example
which
we
shall
relate
for
the
emolument
of
the
reader
a
certain
needy
author
having
found
means
to
present
a
manuscript
to
one
of
those
sons
of
fortune
who
are
dignified
with
the
appellation
of
patrons
instead
of
reaping
that
applause
and
advantage
with
which
he
had
regaled
his
fancy
had
the
mortification
to
find
his
performance
treated
with
infinite
irreverence
and
contempt
and
in
high
dudgeon
and
disappointment
appealed
to
the
judgment
of
another
critic
who
he
knew
had
no
veneration
for
the
first
this
common
consolation
to
which
all
baffled
authors
have
recourse
was
productive
of
very
happy
consequences
to
our
bard
for
though
the
opinions
of
both
judges
concerning
the
piece
were
altogether
the
same
the
latter
either
out
of
compassion
to
the
appellant
or
desire
of
rendering
his
rival
ridiculous
in
the
eye
of
taste
undertook
to
repair
the
misfortune
and
in
this
manner
executed
the
plan
in
a
meeting
of
literati
to
which
both
these
wits
belonged
he
who
had
espoused
the
poet
cause
having
previously
desired
another
member
to
bring
his
composition
on
the
carpet
no
sooner
heard
it
mentioned
than
he
began
to
censure
it
with
flagrant
marks
of
scorn
and
with
an
ironical
air
looking
at
its
first
condemner
observed
that
he
must
be
furiously
infected
with
the
rage
of
patronising
who
could
take
such
a
deplorable
performance
into
his
protection
the
sarcasm
took
effect
the
person
against
whom
it
was
levelled
taking
umbrage
at
his
presumption
assumed
an
aspect
of
disdain
and
replied
with
great
animosity
that
nothing
was
more
easily
supported
than
the
character
of
a
zoilus
because
no
production
was
altogether
free
from
blemishes
and
any
man
might
pronounce
against
any
piece
by
the
lump
without
interesting
his
own
discernment
but
to
perceive
the
beauties
of
a
work
it
was
requisite
to
have
learning
judgment
and
taste
and
therefore
he
did
not
wonder
that
the
gentleman
had
overlooked
a
great
many
in
the
composition
which
he
so
contemptuously
decried
a
rejoinder
succeeded
this
reply
and
produced
a
long
train
of
altercation
in
which
the
gentleman
who
had
formerly
treated
the
book
with
such
disrespect
now
professed
himself
its
passionate
admirer
and
held
forth
in
praise
of
it
with
great
warmth
and
elocution
not
contented
with
having
exhibited
this
instance
of
regard
he
next
morning
sent
a
message
to
the
owner
importing
that
he
had
but
superficially
glanced
over
the
manuscript
and
desiring
the
favour
of
perusing
it
a
second
time
being
indulged
in
this
request
he
recommended
it
in
terms
of
rapture
to
all
his
friends
and
dependants
and
by
dint
of
unwearied
solicitation
procured
a
very
ample
subscription
for
the
author
but
to
resume
the
thread
of
our
story
teresa
practices
were
not
confined
to
simple
defamation
her
reproaches
were
contrived
so
as
to
imply
some
intelligence
in
favour
of
the
person
she
reviled
in
exemplifying
his
pertness
and
arrogance
she
repeated
his
witty
repartee
on
pretence
of
blaming
his
ferocity
she
recounted
proofs
of
his
spirit
and
prowess
and
in
explaining
the
source
of
his
vanity
gave
her
mistress
to
understand
that
a
certain
young
lady
of
fashion
was
said
to
be
enamoured
of
his
person
nor
did
this
understrapper
omit
those
other
parts
of
her
cue
which
the
principal
judged
necessary
for
the
furtherance
of
his
scheme
her
conversation
became
less
guarded
and
took
a
freer
turn
than
usual
she
seized
all
opportunities
of
introducing
little
amorous
stories
the
greatest
part
of
which
were
invented
for
the
purposes
of
warming
her
passions
and
lowering
the
price
of
chastity
in
her
esteem
for
she
represented
all
the
young
contemporaries
in
point
of
age
and
situation
as
so
many
sensualists
who
without
scruple
indulged
themselves
in
the
stolen
pleasures
of
youth
meanwhile
ferdinand
seconded
these
endeavours
with
his
whole
industry
and
address
he
redoubled
if
possible
his
deference
and
respect
whetting
his
assiduity
to
the
keenest
edge
of
attention
and
in
short
regulated
his
dress
conversation
and
deportment
according
to
the
fancy
turn
and
prevailing
humour
of
his
young
mistress
he
moreover
attempted
to
profit
by
her
curiosity
which
he
knew
to
be
truly
feminine
and
having
culled
from
the
library
of
his
patron
certain
dangerous
books
calculated
to
debauch
the
minds
of
young
people
left
them
occasionally
upon
the
table
in
his
apartment
after
having
directed
teresa
to
pick
them
up
as
if
by
accident
in
his
absence
and
carry
them
off
for
the
entertainment
of
mademoiselle
nay
this
crafty
projector
found
means
to
furnish
his
associate
with
some
mischievous
preparations
which
were
mingled
in
her
chocolate
tea
or
coffee
as
provocations
to
warm
her
constitution
yet
all
these
machinations
ingenious
as
they
were
failed
not
only
in
fulfilling
their
aim
but
even
in
shaking
the
foundations
of
her
virtue
or
pride
which
stood
their
assaults
unmoved
like
a
strong
tower
built
upon
a
rock
impregnable
to
all
the
tempestuous
blasts
of
heaven
not
but
that
the
conspirators
were
more
than
once
mistaken
in
the
effects
of
their
artifices
and
disposed
to
applaud
themselves
on
the
progress
they
had
made
when
at
any
time
she
expressed
a
desire
to
examine
those
performances
which
were
laid
before
her
as
snares
to
entrap
her
chastity
they
attributed
that
which
was
no
other
than
curiosity
to
a
looseness
of
sentiment
and
when
she
discovered
no
aversion
to
hear
those
anecdotes
concerning
the
frailty
of
her
neighbours
they
imputed
to
abatement
of
chastity
that
satisfaction
which
was
the
result
of
on
her
own
superior
virtue
so
far
did
the
treacherous
accomplice
of
fathom
presume
upon
these
misconstructions
that
she
at
length
divested
her
tongue
of
all
restraint
and
behaved
in
such
a
manner
that
the
young
lady
confounded
and
incensed
at
her
indecency
and
impudence
rebuked
her
with
great
severity
and
commanded
her
to
reform
her
discourse
on
pain
of
being
dismissed
with
disgrace
from
her
service
chapter
nine
the
confederates
change
their
battery
and
achieve
a
remarkable
adventure
thunderstruck
at
this
disappointment
the
confederates
held
a
council
in
order
to
deliberate
upon
the
next
measures
that
should
be
taken
and
ferdinand
for
the
present
despairing
of
accomplishing
his
grand
aim
resolved
to
profit
in
another
manner
by
the
conveniency
of
his
situation
he
represented
to
his
helpmate
that
it
would
be
prudent
for
them
to
make
hay
while
the
sun
shone
as
their
connexion
might
be
sooner
or
later
discovered
and
an
end
put
to
all
those
opportunities
which
they
now
so
happily
enjoyed
all
principles
of
morality
had
been
already
excluded
from
their
former
plan
consequently
he
found
it
an
easy
task
to
interest
teresa
in
any
other
scheme
tending
to
their
mutual
advantage
howsoever
wicked
and
perfidious
it
might
be
he
therefore
persuaded
her
to
be
his
auxiliary
in
defrauding
mademoiselle
at
play
and
gave
her
suitable
directions
for
that
purpose
and
even
tutored
her
how
to
abuse
the
trust
reposed
in
her
by
embezzling
the
young
lady
effects
without
incurring
the
suspicion
of
dishonesty
on
the
supposition
that
every
servant
in
the
house
was
not
able
to
resist
such
temptation
the
purse
of
her
mistress
to
which
the
maid
had
always
access
was
dropped
in
a
passage
which
the
domestics
had
occasion
to
frequent
and
fathom
posted
himself
in
a
convenient
place
in
order
to
observe
the
effect
of
his
stratagem
here
he
was
not
disappointed
in
his
conjecture
the
first
person
who
chanced
to
pass
that
way
was
one
of
the
chambermaids
with
whom
teresa
had
lived
for
some
time
in
a
state
of
inveterate
enmity
because
the
wench
had
failed
in
that
homage
and
respect
which
was
paid
to
her
by
the
rest
of
the
servants
ferdinand
had
in
his
heart
espoused
the
quarrel
of
his
associate
and
longed
for
an
occasion
to
deliver
her
from
the
malicious
observance
of
such
an
antagonist
when
he
therefore
saw
her
approach
his
heart
throbbed
with
joyful
expectations
but
when
she
snatched
up
the
purse
and
thrust
it
in
her
bosom
with
all
the
eagerness
and
confusion
of
one
determined
to
appropriate
the
windfall
to
her
own
use
his
transports
were
altogether
unspeakable
he
traced
her
to
her
own
apartment
whither
she
immediately
retreated
with
great
trepidation
and
then
communicated
the
discovery
to
teresa
together
with
instructions
how
to
behave
in
the
sequel
in
conformity
with
these
lessons
she
took
the
first
opportunity
of
going
to
mademoiselle
and
demanding
money
for
some
necessary
expense
that
the
loss
might
be
known
before
the
finder
could
have
leisure
to
make
any
fresh
conveyance
of
the
prize
and
in
the
meantime
ferdinand
kept
a
strict
eye
upon
the
motions
of
the
chambermaid
the
young
lady
having
rummaged
her
pockets
in
vain
expressed
some
surprise
at
the
loss
of
her
purse
upon
which
her
attendant
gave
indications
of
extreme
amazement
and
concern
she
said
it
could
not
possibly
be
lost
entreated
her
to
search
her
escritoir
while
she
herself
ran
about
the
room
prying
into
every
corner
with
all
the
symptoms
of
fear
and
distraction
having
made
this
unsuccessful
inquiry
she
pretended
to
shed
a
flood
of
tears
bewailing
her
own
fate
in
being
near
the
person
of
any
lady
who
met
with
such
a
misfortune
by
which
she
observed
her
character
might
be
called
in
question
she
produced
her
own
keys
and
begged
upon
her
knees
that
her
chamber
and
boxes
might
be
searched
without
delay
in
a
word
she
demeaned
herself
so
artfully
upon
this
occasion
that
her
mistress
who
never
entertained
the
least
doubt
of
her
integrity
now
looked
upon
her
as
a
miracle
of
fidelity
and
attachment
and
was
at
infinite
pains
to
console
her
for
the
accident
which
had
happened
protesting
that
for
her
own
part
the
loss
of
the
money
should
never
affect
her
with
a
moment
uneasiness
if
she
could
retrieve
a
certain
medal
which
she
had
long
kept
in
her
purse
as
a
remembrance
of
her
deceased
aunt
from
whom
she
received
it
in
a
present
fathom
entered
accidentally
into
the
midst
of
this
scene
and
perceiving
the
agitation
of
the
maid
and
the
concern
of
the
mistress
desired
in
a
respectful
manner
to
know
the
cause
of
their
disorder
before
the
young
lady
had
time
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
the
case
his
accomplice
exclaimed
in
an
affected
passion
fathom
my
lady
has
lost
her
purse
and
as
no
persons
in
the
family
are
so
much
about
her
as
you
and
i
you
must
give
me
leave
in
my
own
justification
to
insist
upon
mademoiselle
ordering
the
apartments
of
us
both
to
be
searched
without
loss
of
time
here
are
my
pockets
and
my
keys
and
you
can
not
scruple
to
give
her
the
same
satisfaction
for
innocence
has
nothing
to
fear
miss
melvil
reprimanded
her
sharply
for
her
unmannerly
zeal
and
ferdinand
eyeing
her
with
a
look
of
disdain
madam
said
he
i
approve
of
your
proposal
but
before
i
undergo
such
mortification
i
would
advise
mademoiselle
to
subject
the
two
chambermaids
to
such
inquiry
as
they
also
have
access
to
the
apartments
and
are
i
apprehend
as
likely
as
you
or
i
to
behave
in
such
a
scandalous
manner
the
young
lady
declared
that
she
was
too
well
satisfied
of
honesty
and
ferdinand
honour
to
harbour
the
least
suspicion
of
either
and
that
she
would
sooner
die
than
disgrace
them
so
far
as
to
comply
with
the
proposal
the
former
had
made
but
as
she
saw
no
reason
for
exempting
the
inferior
servants
from
that
examination
which
fathom
advised
she
would
forthwith
put
it
in
execution
the
chambermaids
being
accordingly
summoned
she
calmly
asked
if
either
of
them
had
accidentally
found
the
purse
she
had
dropped
and
both
replying
in
the
negative
she
assumed
an
air
of
severity
and
determination
and
demanding
their
keys
threatened
to
examine
their
trunks
on
the
instant
the
guilty
abigail
who
though
an
hungarian
was
not
inferior
in
point
of
effrontery
to
any
one
of
the
sisterhood
in
england
no
sooner
heard
this
menace
than
she
affected
an
air
of
affronted
innocence
thanked
god
she
had
lived
in
many
reputable
families
and
been
trusted
with
untold
gold
but
was
never
before
suspected
of
theft
that
the
other
maid
might
do
as
she
should
think
proper
and
be
enough
to
let
her
things
be
tumbled
and
exposed
but
for
her
own
part
if
she
should
be
used
in
that
inhuman
and
disgraceful
manner
she
would
not
stay
another
hour
in
the
house
and
in
conclusion
said
that
mademoiselle
had
more
reason
to
look
sharp
after
those
who
enjoyed
the
greatest
share
of
her
favour
than
believe
their
malicious
insinuations
against
innocent
people
whom
they
were
well
known
to
hate
and
defame
this
declaration
implying
an
hint
to
the
prejudice
of
teresa
far
from
diverting
miss
melvil
from
her
purpose
served
only
to
enhance
the
character
of
the
accused
in
her
opinion
and
to
confirm
her
suspicion
of
the
accuser
of
whom
she
again
demanded
her
keys
protesting
that
should
she
prove
refractory
the
count
himself
should
take
cognisance
of
the
affair
whereas
if
she
would
deal
ingenuously
she
should
have
no
cause
to
repent
of
her
confession
so
saying
she
desired
our
adventurer
to
take
the
trouble
of
calling
up
some
of
the
upon
which
the
conscious
criminal
began
to
tremble
and
falling
upon
her
knees
acknowledged
her
guilt
and
implored
the
forgiveness
of
her
young
mistress
teresa
seizing
this
occasion
to
signalise
her
generosity
joined
in
the
request
and
the
offender
was
pardoned
after
having
restored
the
purse
and
promised
in
the
sight
of
heaven
that
the
devil
should
never
again
entice
her
to
the
commission
of
such
a
crime
this
adventure
fully
answered
all
the
purposes
of
our
politician
it
established
the
opinion
of
his
virtue
beyond
the
power
of
accident
or
information
to
shake
and
set
up
a
false
beacon
to
mislead
the
sentiments
of
mademoiselle

case
she
should
for
the

with
the
like

was

with
consternation
and
with
the
appearance
of
extreme
chagrin
demanded
her
dismission
affirming
that
these
things
were
certainly
effected
by
some
person
in

with
a
view

murdering

quieted

a

of

vanished
when
teresa
could
no
longer
keep
her
affliction
within
bounds
indeed
this
was
an
event
of
more
consequence
than
all
the
rest
which
had
happened
for
the
jewels
were
valued
at
five
hundred
florins
mademoiselle
was
accordingly
alarmed
to
such
a
degree
that
she
made
her
mother
acquainted
with
her
loss
and
that
good
lady
who
was
an
excellent
economist
did
not
fail
to
give
indications
of
extraordinary
concern
she
asked
if
her
daughter
had
reason
to
suspect
any
individual
in
the
family
and
if
she
was
perfectly
confident
of
her
own
woman
integrity
upon
which
mademoiselle
with
many
encomiums
on
the
fidelity
and
attachment
of
teresa
recounted
the
adventure
of
the
chambermaid
who
immediately
underwent
a
strict
inquiry
and
was
even
committed
to
prison
on
the
strength
of
her
former
misdemeanour
our
adventurer
mate
insisted
upon
undergoing
the
same
trial
with
the
rest
of
the
domestics
and
as
usual
comprehended
fathom
in
her
insinuations
while
he
seconded
the
proposal
and
privately
counselled
the
old
lady
to
introduce
teresa
to
the
magistrate
of
the
place
by
these
preconcerted
recriminations
they
escaped
all
suspicion
of
collusion
after
a
fruitless
inquiry
the
prisoner
was
discharged
from
her
confinement
and
turned
out
of
the
service
of
the
count
in
whose
private
opinion
the
character
of
no
person
suffered
so
much
as
that
of
his
own
son
whom
he
suspected
of
having
embezzled
the
jewels
for
the
use
of
a
certain
inamorata
who
at
that
time
was
said
to
have
captivated
his
affections
the
old
gentleman
felt
upon
this
occasion
all
that
internal
anguish
which
a
man
of
honour
may
be
supposed
to
suffer
on
account
of
a
degeneracy
and
without
divulging
his
sentiments
or
even
hinting
his
suspicions
to
the
youth
himself
determined
to
detach
him
at
once
from
such
dangerous
connexions
by
sending
him
forthwith
to
vienna
on
pretence
of
finishing
his
exercises
at
the
academy
and
ushering
him
into
acquaintance
with
the
great
world
though
he
would
not
be
thought
by
the
young
gentleman
himself
to
harbour
the
least
doubt
of
his
morals
he
did
not
scruple
to
unbosom
himself
on
that
subject
to
ferdinand
whose
sagacity
and
virtue
he
held
in
great
veneration
this
indulgent
patron
expressed
himself
in
the
most
pathetic
terms
on
the
untoward
disposition
of
his
son
he
told

that
he
should
accompany

that
was
the
youth
name
not
only
as
a
companion
but
a
preceptor
and
pattern
conjured
him
to
assist
his
tutor
in
superintending
his
conduct
and
to
reinforce
the
governor
precepts
by
his
own
example
to
inculcate
upon
him
the
most
delicate
punctilios
of
honour
and
decoy
him
into
extravagance
rather
than
leave
the
least
illiberal
sentiment
in
his
heart
our
crafty
adventurer
with
demonstrations
of
the
utmost
sensibility
acknowledged
the
great
goodness
of
the
count
in
reposing
such
confidence
in
his
integrity
which
as
he
observed
none
but
the
worst
of
villains
could
abuse
and
fervently
wished
that
he
might
no
longer
exist
than
he
should
continue
to
remember
and
resent
the
obligations
he
owed
to
his
kind
benefactor
while
preparations
were
making
for
their
departure
our
hero
held
a
council
with
his
associate
whom
he
enriched
with
many
sage
instructions
touching
her
future
operations
he
at
the
same
time
disburdened
her
of
all
or
the
greatest
part
of
the
spoils
she
had
won
and
after
having
received
divers
marks
of
bounty
from
the
count
and
his
lady
together
with
a
purse
from
his
young
mistress
he
set
out
for
vienna
in
the
eighteenth
year
of
his
age
with
renaldo
and
his
governor
who
were
provided
with
letters
of
recommendation
to
some
of
the
friends
belonging
to
the
imperial
court
such
a
favourable
introduction
could
not
fail
of
being
advantageous
to
a
youth
of
ferdinand
specious
accomplishments
for
he
was
considered
as
the
young
count
companion
admitted
into
his
parties
and
included
in
all
the
entertainments
to
which
renaldo
was
invited
he
soon
distinguished
himself
by
his
activity
and
address
in
the
course
of
those
exercises
that
were
taught
at
the
academy
of
which
he
was
pupil
his
manners
were
so
engaging
as
to
attract
the
acquaintance
of
his
and
his
conversation
being
sprightly
and
inoffensive
grew
into
very
great
request
in
a
word
he
and
the
young
count
formed
a
remarkable
contrast
which
in
the
eye
of
the
world
redounded
to
his
advantage
they
were
certainly
in
all
respects
the
reverse
of
each
other
renaldo
under
a
total
defect
of
exterior
cultivation
possessed
a
most
excellent
understanding
with
every
virtue
that
dignifies
the
human
heart
while
the
other
beneath
a
most
agreeable
outside
with
an
inaptitude
and
aversion
to
letters
concealed
an
amazing
fund
of
villany
and
ingratitude
hitherto
his
observation
had
been
confined
to
a
narrow
sphere
and
his
reflections
though
surprisingly
just
and
acute
had
not
attained
to
that
maturity
which
age
and
experience
give
but
now
his
perceptions
began
to
be
more
distinct
and
extended
to
a
thousand
objects
which
had
never
before
come
under
his
cognisance
he
had
formerly
imagined
but
was
now
fully
persuaded
that
the
sons
of
men
preyed
upon
one
another
and
such
was
the
end
and
condition
of
their
being
among
the
principal
figures
of
life
he
observed
few
or
no
characters
that
did
not
bear
a
strong
analogy
to
the
savage
tyrants
of
the
wood
one
resembled
a
tiger
in
fury
and
rapaciousness
a
second
prowled
about
like
an
hungry
wolf
seeking
whom
he
might
devour
a
third
acted
the
part
of
a
jackal
in
beating
the
bush
for
game
to
his
voracious
employer
and
the
fourth
imitated
the
wily
fox
in
practising
a
thousand
crafty
ambuscades
for
the
destruction
of
the
ignorant
and
unwary
this
last
was
the
department
of
life
for
which
he
found
himself
best
qualified
by
nature
and
inclination
and
he
accordingly
resolved
that
his
talent
should
not
rust
in
his
possession
he
was
already
pretty
well
versed
in
all
the
sciences
of
play
but
he
had
every
day
occasion
to
see
these
arts
carried
to
such
a
surprising
pitch
of
finesse
and
dexterity
as
discouraged
him
from
building
his
schemes
on
that
foundation
he
therefore
determined
to
fascinate
the
judgment
rather
than
the
eyes
of
his
by
a
continual
exercise
of
that
gift
of
deceiving
with
which
he
knew
himself
endued
to
an
unrivalled
degree
and
to
acquire
unbounded
influence
with
those
who
might
be
subservient
to
his
interest
by
an
assiduous
application
to
their
prevailing
passions
not
that
play
was
altogether
left
out
in
the
projection
of
his
though
he
engaged
himself
very
little
in
the
executive
part
of
gaming
he
had
not
been
long
in
vienna
when
he
entered
into
league
with
a
genius
of
that
kind
whom
he
distinguished
among
the
pupils
of
the
academy
and
who
indeed
had
taken
up
his
habitation
in
that
place
with
a
view
to
pillage
the
provincials
on
their
first
arrival
in
town
before
they
could
be
armed
with
proper
circumspection
to
preserve
their
money
or
have
time
to
dispose
of
it
in
any
other
shape
similar
characters
naturally
attract
each
other
and
people
of
our
principles
are
of
all
others
the
most
apt
to
distinguish
their
own
likeness
wheresoever
it
occurs
because
they
always
keep
the
faculty
of
discerning
in
full
exertion
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
mutual
alertness
that
ferdinand
and
the
stranger
who
was
a
native
of
tyrol
perceived
themselves
reflected
in
the
dispositions
of
each
other
and
immediately
entered
into
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance

absented

artfully
provoked

he
could
not
resist
the
temptation
but
engaged
at

with
that
fell
adversary
who
in
less
than
an
hour
stripped
him
of
a
pretty
round
sum
next
day
when
the
young
gentleman
recovered
the
use
of
his
reflection
he
was
sensibly
chagrined
at
the
folly
and
precipitation
of
his
own
conduct
an
account
of
which
he
communicated
in
confidence
to
our
hero
with
demonstrations
of
infinite
shame
and
concern

having
moralised
upon
the
subject
with
great
sagacity
and
sharply
inveighed
against
the
tyrolese
for
the
unfair
advantage

had
taken
retired
to
his
closet
and
wrote
the
following
billet
which
was
immediately
sent
to
his
ally

the
attachments

not
suffer

to
be
an
idle
spectator
of
the
wrongs
offered
to

son
in
the
dishonourable
use
i
understand
you
made
last

of
his
unguarded
hours
i
therefore
insist
upon
your
making
immediate
restitution
of
the
booty
which
you
so
unjustly
got
otherwise
i
expect
you
will
meet
me
upon
the
ramparts
near

at
daybreak
in
order
to
justify
with
your
sword
the
finesse
you
have
practised
upon
the
friend
of
ferdinand
de
fathom
the
gamester
no
sooner
received
this
intimation
than
according
to
the
plan
which
had
been
preconcerted
betwixt
the
author
and
him
he
went
to
the
apartment
of
renaldo
and
presenting
the
sum
of
money
which
he
had
defrauded
him
of
the
preceding
night
told
him
with
a
stern
countenance
that
though
it
was
a
just
acquisition
he
scorned
to
avail
himself
of
his
good
fortune
against
any
person
who
entertained
the
smallest
doubt
of
his
honour
the
young
count
surprised
at
this
address
rejected
his
offer
with
disdain
and
desired
to
know
the
meaning
of
such
an
unexpected
declaration
upon
which
the
other
produced
ferdinand
billet
and
threatened
in
very
high
terms
to
meet
the
stripling
according
to
his
invitation
and
chastise
him
severely
for
his
presumption
the
consequence
of
this
explanation
is
obvious
renaldo
imputing
the
officiousness
of
fathom
to
the
zeal
of
his
friendship
interposed
in
the
quarrel
which
was
amicably
compromised
not
a
little
to
the
honour
of
our
adventurer
who
thus
obtained
an
opportunity
of
displaying
his
courage
and
integrity
without
the
least
hazard
to
his
person
while
at
the
same
time
his
confederate
recommended
himself
to
the
esteem
of
the
young
count
by
his
spirited
behaviour
on
this
occasion
so
that
renaldo
being
less
shy
of
his
company
for
the
future
the
tyrolese
had
the
fairer
opportunities
to
prosecute
his
designs
upon
the
young
gentleman
purse
it
would
be
almost
superfluous
to
say
that
these
were
not
neglected
the
son
of
count
melvil
was
not
deficient
in
point
of
penetration
but
his
whole
study
was
at
that
time
engrossed
by
the
care
of
his
education
and
he
had
sometimes
recourse
to
play
as
an
amusement
by
which
he
sought
to
unbend
the
severity
of
his
attention
no
wonder
then
that
he
fell
a
prey
to
an
artful
gamester
who
had
been
regularly
trained
to
the
profession
and
made
it
the
sole
study
of
his
life
especially
as
the
hungarian
was
remarkable
for
a
warmth
of
temper
which
a
knight
of
the
post
always
knows
how
to
manage
for
his
own
advantage
in
the
course
of
these
operations
fathom

a
very
useful
correspondent
he
instructed
the
tyrolese
in
the
peculiarities
of

and
made
him
acquainted
with
the
proper
seasons
for
profiting
by
his
dexterity

for
example
who
by
the
authority
derived
to
him
from
the
injunctions
of
the
old
count

took
upon
himself
the
office
of
an
adviser
cunningly
chose
to
counsel
the
son
at
those
conjunctures
when
he
knew
him
least
able
to
bear
such
expostulation
advice
improperly
administered
generally
acts
in
diametrical
opposition
to
the
purpose
for
which
it
is
supposed
to
be
given
at

this
was
the
case
with
the
young
gentleman
who
inflamed
by
the
reproof
of
such
a
tutor
used
to
obey
the
dictates
of
his
resentment
in
an
immediate
repetition
of
that
conduct
which
our
adventurer
had
taken
the
liberty
to
disapprove
and
the
gamester
was
always
at
hand
to
minister
unto
his
indignation
by
these
means
he
was
disencumbered
of
divers
considerable
remittances
with
which
his
father
cheerfully
supplied
him
on
the
supposition
that
they
were
spent
with
taste
and
liberality
under
the
direction
of
our
adventurer
but
ferdinand
views
were
not
confined
to
the
narrow
field
of
this
alliance
he
attempted
divers
enterprises
in
the
world
of
gallantry
conscious
of
his
own
personal
qualifications
and
never
doubting
that
he
could
insinuate
himself
into
the
good
graces
of
some
married
lady
about
court
or
lay
an
opulent
dowager
under
contribution
but
he
met
with
an
obstacle
in
his
endeavours
of
this
kind
which
all
his
art
was
unable
to
surmount
this
was
no
other
than
the
obscurity
of
his
birth
and
the
want
of
a
title
without
which
no
person
in
that
country
lays
claim
to
the
privileges
of
a
gentleman
had
he
foreseen
this
inconvenience
he
might
have
made
shift
to
obviate
the
consequences
by
obtaining
permission
to
appear
in
the
character
of
the
count
kinsman
though
in
all
probability
such
an
expedient
would
not
have
been
extremely
agreeable
to
the
old
gentleman
who
was
very
tenacious
of
the
honour
of
his
family
nevertheless
his
generosity
might
have
been
prevailed
upon
to
indulge
fathom
with
such
a
pretext
in
consideration
of
the
supposed
attachment
and
the
obligations
for
which
he
deemed
himself
indebted
to
his
deceased
mother

ferdinand
upon
his
first
arrival
at
vienna
had
been
admitted
into
fashionable
company
on
the
footing
of
renaldo
companion
because
nobody
suspected
the
defect
of
his
pedigree
and
even
after
a
report
had
been
circulated
to
the
prejudice
of
his
extraction
by
the
industry
of
a
lacquey
who
attended
the
young
count
there
were
not
wanting
many
young
people
of
distinction
who
still
favoured
him
with
their
countenance
and
correspondence
but
he
was
no
longer
invited
to
private
families
in
which
only
he
could
expect
to
profit
by
his
address
among
the
ladies
and
had
the
mortification
of
finding
himself
frequently
excepted
from
parties
which
were
expressly
calculated
for
the
entertainment
of
the
young
count
luckily
his
spirit
was
so
pliant
as
to
sustain
these
slights
without
being
much
dejected
instead
of
repining
at
the
loss
of
that
respect
which
had
been
paid
to
him
at
first
he
endeavoured
with
all
his
might
to
preserve
the
little
that
still
remained
and
resolved
to
translate
into
a
humbler
sphere
that
gallantry
which
he
had
no
longer
opportunities
of
displaying
in
the
world
of
rank
and
fashion

among

fortune
had
left
and
even
carried
his
complaisance
so
far
as
to
become
the
humble
servant
of
their
pleasures
while
he
attempted
to
extend
his
acquaintance
in
an
inferior
path
of
life
where
he
thought
his
talents
would
shine
more
conspicuous
than
at
the
assemblies
of

great
and
conduce
more
effectually
to
the
interest
of
all
his
designs
nor
did
he
find
himself
disappointed
in
that
expectation
sanguine
as
it
was
he
soon
found
means
to
be
introduced
to
the
house
of
a
wealthy
bourgeois
where
every
individual
was

with
his

himself
to

and
loquacity
of
the

upon

alternately
for
the
amusement
of
his
only
daughter
a
buxom
lass
nearly
of
his
own
age
the
fruit
of
a
former
marriage
it
was
not
long
before
ferdinand
had
reason
to
congratulate
himself
on
the
footing
he
had
gained
in
this
society
he
had
expected
to
find
and
in
a
little
time
actually
discovered
that
mutual
jealousy
and
rancour
which
almost
always
subsist
between
a
daughter
and
her
inflamed
with
all
the
virulence
of
female
emulation
for
the
disparity
in
their
ages
served
only
to
render
them
the
more
inveterate
rivals
in
the
desire
of
captivating
the
other
sex
our
adventurer
having
deliberated
upon
the
means
of
converting
this
animosity
to
his
own
advantage
saw
no
method
for
this
purpose
so
feasible
as
that
of
making
his
approaches
to
the
hearts
of
both
by
ministering
to
each
in
private
food
for
their
reciprocal
envy
and
malevolence
because
he
well
knew
that
no
road
lies
so
direct
and
open
to
a
woman
heart
as
that
of
gratifying
her
passions
of
vanity
and
resentment
when
he
had
an
opportunity
of
being
particular
with
the
mother
he
expressed
his
concern
for
having
unwittingly
incurred
the
displeasure
of
mademoiselle
which
he
observed
was
obvious
in
every
circumstance
of
her
behaviour
towards
him
protesting
he
was
utterly
innocent
of
all
intention
of
offending
her
and
that
he
could
not
account
for
his
disgrace
any
other
way
than
by
supposing
she
took
umbrage
at
the
direction
of
his
chief
regards
towards
her
which
he
owned
was
altogether
involuntary
being
wholly
influenced
by
that
superior
charms
and
politeness
such
a
declaration
was
perfectly
well
calculated
for
the
meridian
of
a
dame
like
her
who
with
all
the
intoxications
of
unenlightened
pride
and
an
increased
appetite
for
pleasure
had
begun
to
find
herself
neglected
and
even
to
believe
that
her
attractions
were
actually
on
the
wane
she
very
graciously
consoled
our
gallant
for
the
mishap
of
which
he
complained
representing
wilhelmina
that
was
the
daughter
name
as
a
pert
illiterate
envious
baggage
of
whose
disgust
he
ought
to
make
no
consideration
then
she
recounted
many
instances
of
her
own
generosity
to
that
young
lady
with
the
returns
of
malice
and
ingratitude
she
had
made
and
lastly
enumerated
all
the
imperfections
of
her
person
education
and
behaviour
that
he
might
see
with
what
justice
the
gypsy
pretended
to
vie
with
those
who
had
been
distinguished
by
the
approbation
and
even
gallantry
of
the
best
people
in
vienna
having
thus
established
himself
her
confidant
and
gossip
he
knew
his
next
step
of
promotion
would
necessarily
be
to
the
degree
of
her
lover
and
in
that
belief
resolved
to
play
the
same
game
with
mademoiselle
wilhelmina
whose
complexion
was
very
much
akin
to
that
of
her
stepmother
indeed
they
resembled
each
other
too
much
to
live
upon
any
terms
of
friendship
or
even
decorum
fathom
in
order
to
enjoy
a
private
conversation
with
the
young
lady
never
failed
to
repeat
his
visit
every
afternoon
till
at
length
he
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
her
disengaged
the
jeweller
being
occupied
among
his
workmen
and
his
wife
gone
to
assist
at
a
our
adventurer
and
the
daughter
had
already
exchanged
their
vows
by
the
expressive
language
of
the
eyes
he
had
even
declared
himself
in
some
tender
ejaculations
which
had
been
softly
whispered
in
her
ear
when
he
could
snatch
an
opportunity
of
venting
them
unperceived
nay
he
had
upon
divers
occasions
gently
squeezed
her
fair
hand
on
pretence
of
tuning
her
harpsichord
and
been
favoured
with
returns
of
the
same
cordial
pressure
so
that
instead
of
accosting
her
with
the
fearful
hesitation
and
reserve
of
a
timid
swain
he
told
her
after
the
exercise
of
the
that
he
was
come
to
confer
with
her
upon
a
subject
that
nearly
concerned
her
peace
and
asked
if
she
had
not
observed
of
late
an
evident
abatement
of
friendship
in
her
mother
behaviour
to
him
whom
she
had
formerly
treated
with
such
marks
of
favour
and
respect
mademoiselle
would
not
pay
so
ill
a
compliment
to
her
own
discernment
as
to
say
she
had
not
perceived
the
alteration
which
on
the
contrary
she
owned
was
extremely
palpable
nor
was
it
difficult
to
divine
the
cause
of
such
estranged
looks
this
remark
was
accompanied
with
an
irresistible
glance
she
smiled
enchanting
the
colour
deepened
on
her
cheeks
her
breast
began
to
heave
and
her
whole
frame
underwent
a
most
agreeable
confusion
ferdinand
was
not
a
man
to
let
such
a
favourable
conjuncture
pass
unregarded
yes
charming
wilhelmina
exclaimed
the
politician
in
an
affected
rapture
the
cause
is
as
conspicuous
as
your
attractions
she
hath
in
spite
of
all
my
circumspection
perceived
that
passion
which
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
conceal
and
in
consequence
of
which
i
now
declare
myself
your
devoted
adorer
or
conscious
of
your
superior
excellence
her
jealousy
hath
taken
the
alarm
and
though
stung
with
conjecture
only
repines
at
the
triumph
of
your
perfections
how
far
this
spirit
of
malignity
may
be
inflamed
to
my
prejudice
i
know
not
perhaps
as
this
is
the
first
it
may
be
also
the
last
opportunity
i
shall
have
of
avowing
the
dearest
sentiments
of
my
heart
to
the
fair
object
that
inspired
them
in
a
word
i
may
be
for
ever
excluded
from
your
presence
excuse
me
then
divine
creature
from
the
practice
of
those
unnecessary
forms
which
i
should
take
pride
in
observing
were
i
indulged
with
the
ordinary
privileges
of
an
honourable
lover
and
once
for
all
accept
the
homage
of
an
heart
overflowing
with
love
and
admiration
yes
adorable
wilhelmina
i
am
dazzled
with
your
supernatural
beauty
your
other
accomplishments
strike
me
with
wonder
and
awe
i
am
enchanted
by
the
graces
of
your
deportment
ravished
with
the
charms
of
your
conversation
and
there
is
a
certain
tenderness
of
benevolence
in
that
endearing
aspect
which
i
trust
will
not
fail
to
melt
with
sympathy
at
the
emotions
of
a
faithful
slave
like
me
so
saying
he
threw
himself
upon
his
knees
and
seizing
her
plump
hand
pressed
it
to
his
lips
with
all
the
violence
of
real
transport
the
nymph
whose
passions
nature
had
filled
to
the
brim
could
not
hear
such
a
rhapsody
unmoved
being
an
utter
stranger
to
addresses
of
this
kind
she
understood
every
word
of
it
in
the
literal
acceptation
she
believed
implicitly
in
the
truth
of
the
encomiums
he
had
bestowed
and
thought
it
reasonable
he
should
be
rewarded
for
the
justice
he
had
done
to
her
qualifications
which
had
hitherto
been
almost
altogether
overlooked
in
short
her
heart
began
to
thaw
and
her
face
to
hang
out
the
flag
of
capitulation
which
was
no
sooner
perceived
by
our
hero
than
he
renewed
his
attack
with
redoubled
fervour
pronouncing
in
a
most
vehement
tone
light
of
my
eyes
and
empress
of
my
soul
behold
me
prostrate
at
your
feet
waiting
with
the
most
pious
resignation
for
that
sentence
from
your
lips
on
which
my
future
happiness
or
misery
must
altogether
depend
not
with
more
reverence
does
the
unhappy

kiss
the

contains
his
doom

will
submit
to
your
fatal

never

i
rise
from
this
suppliant
posture
until
i
am
encouraged
to
live
and
hope
no
if
you
refuse
to
smile
upon
my
passion
here
shall
i
breathe
the
last
sighs
of
a
despairing
lover
here
shall
this
faithful
sword
do
the
last
office
to
its
unfortunate
master
and
shed
the
blood
of
the
truest
heart
that
ever
felt
the
cruel
pangs
of
disappointed

the
young

overcome
by
this
effusion
which
brought
the

into
her

here
this
excellent
actor
began
to
sob
most
piteously
and
the
wilhelmina
unable
longer
to
withstand
his
moving
tale
with
a
repetition
of
the
interjection
ah
gently
dropped
into
his
arms
this
was
the
beginning
of
a
correspondence
that
soon
rose
to
a
very
interesting
pitch
and
they
forthwith
concerted
measures
for
carrying
it
on
without
the
knowledge
or
suspicion
of
her
nevertheless
the
young
lady
vanquished
as
she
was
and
unskilled
in
the
ways
of
men
would
not
all
at
once
yield
at
discretion
but
insisted
upon
those
terms
without
which
no
woman
reputation
can
be
secured
our
lover
far
from
seeking
to
evade
the
proposal
assented
to
it
in
terms
of
uncommon
satisfaction
and
promised
to
use
his
whole
industry
in
finding
a
priest
upon
whose
discretion
they
could
rely
nay
he
certainly
resolved
to
comply
with
her
request
in
good
earnest
rather
than
forfeit
the
advantages
which
he
foresaw
in
their
union
his
good
fortune
however
exempted
him
from
the
necessity
of
taking
such
a
step
which
at
best
must
have
been
disagreeable
for
so
many
difficulties
occurred
in
the
inquiry
which
was
set
on
foot
and
so
artfully
did
fathom
in
the
meantime
manage
the
influence
he
had
already
gained
over
her
heart
that
before
her
passion
could
obtain
a
legal
gratification
she
surrendered
to
his
wish
without
any
other
assurance
than
his
solemn
profession
of
sincerity
and
truth
on
which
she
reposed
herself
with
the
most
implicit
confidence
and
faith
chapter

he
is
exposed
to
a
most
perilous
incident
in
the
course
of
his
intrigue
with
the
daughter
he
was
rejoiced
to
find
her
so
easily
satisfied
in
such
a
momentous
concern
for
the
principal
aim
of
the
intrigue
was
to
make
her
necessary
to
his
interested
views
and
even
if
possible
an
associate
in
the
fraudulent
plans
he
had
projected
upon
her
father
consequently
he
considered
this
relaxation
in
her
virtue
as
an
happy
omen
of
his
future
success
all
the
obstacles
to
their
mutual
enjoyment
being
thus
removed
our
adventurer
was
by
his
mistress
indulged
with
an
assignation
in
her
own
chamber
which
though
contiguous
to
that
of
her
stepmother
was
provided
with
a
door
that
opened
into
a
common
staircase
to
which
he
had
access
at
all
hours
of
the
night
he
did
not
neglect
the
rendezvous
but
presenting
himself
at
the
appointed
time
which
was
midnight
made
the
signal
they
had
agreed
upon
and
was
immediately
admitted
by
wilhelmina

waited
for
hire
with
a
lover
impatience
fathom
was
not
deficient
in
those
expressions
of
rapture
that
are
current
on
those
occasions
but
on
the
contrary
became
so
loud
in
the
transports
of
that
his
voice
reached
the
ears
of
the
vigilant
stepmother
who
wakening
the
jeweller
from
his
first
nap
gave
him
to
understand
that
some
person
was
certainly
in
close
conversation
with
his
daughter
and
exhorted
him
to
rise
forthwith
and
vindicate
the
honour
of
his
family
the
german
who
was
naturally
of
a
phlegmatic
habit
and
never
went
to
bed
without
a
full
dose
of
the
creature
which
added
to
his
constitutional
drowsiness
gave
no
ear
to
his
wife

until
she
had
repeated
it
thrice
and
used
other
means
to
rouse
him
from
the
arms
of
slumber
meanwhile

and
his
inamorata
overheard
her
information
and
our
hero
would
have
made
his
retreat
immediately
through
the
port
by
which
he
entered
had
not
his
intention
been
overruled
by
the
remonstrances
of
the
young
lady
who
observed
that
the
door
was
already
fast
bolted
and
could
not
possibly
be
opened
without
creating
a
noise
that
would
confirm
the
suspicion
of
her
parents
and
that
over
and
above
this
objection
he
would
in
sallying
from
that
door
run
the
risk
of
being
met
by
her
father
who
in
all
probability
would
present
himself
before
it
in
order
to
hinder
our
hero
escape
she
therefore
conveyed
him
softly
into
her
closet
where
she
assured
him
he
might
remain
with
great
tranquillity
in
full
confidence
that
she
would
take
such
measures
as
would
effectually
screen
him
from
detection
he
was
fain
to
depend
upon
her
assurance
and
accordingly
ensconced
himself
behind
her
but
he
could
not
help
sweating
with
apprehension
and
praying
fervently
to
god
for
his
deliverance
when
he
heard
the
jeweller
thundering
at
the
door
and
calling
to
his
daughter
for
admittance
wilhelmina
who
was
already
undressed
and
had
purposely
extinguished
the
light
pretended
to
be
suddenly
waked
from
her
sleep
and
starting
up
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
surprise
and
affright

is
the

the
german

a
terrible
accent

the
door
this
instant
there
is
a
man
in
your
bedchamber
and
by
the
lightning
and
thunder
i
will
wash
away
the
stain
he
has
cast
upon
my
honour
with
the
schellum
not
at
all
intimidated
by
this
boisterous
threat
she
admitted
him
without
hesitation
and
with
a
shrillness
of
voice
peculiar
to
herself
began
to
hold
forth
upon
her
own
innocence
and
his
unjust
suspicion
mingling
in
her
harangue
sundry
oblique
hints
against
her
importing
that
some
people
were
so
viciously
inclined
by
their
own
natures
that
she
did
not
wonder
at
their
doubting
the
virtue
of
other
people
but
that
these
people
despised
the
insinuations
of
such
people
who
ought
to
be
more
circumspect
in
their
own
conduct
lest
they
themselves
should
suffer
reprisals
from
those
people
whom
they
had
so
maliciously
slandered
having
uttered
these
flowers
of
rhetoric
which
were
calculated
for
the
hearing
of
her
who
stood
with
a
light
at
her
husband
back
the
young
lady
assumed
an
ironical
air
and
admonished
her
father
to
search
every
corner
of
her
apartment
she
even
affected
to
assist
his
inquiry
with
her
own
hands
pulled
out
a
parcel
of
small
drawers
in
which
her
trinkets
were
contained
desired
him
to
look
into
her
needlecase
and
thimble
and
seeing
his
examination
fruitless
earnestly
intreated
him
to
rummage
her
closet
also
saying
with
a
sneer
that
in
all
probability
the
dishonourer
would
be
found
in
that
the
manner
in
which
she
pretended
to
ridicule
his
apprehensions
made
an
impression
upon
the
jeweller
who
was
very
well
disposed
to
retreat
into
his
own
nest
when
his
wife
with
a
certain
slyness
in
her
countenance
besought
him
to
comply
with
his
daughter
request
and
look
into
that
same
closet
by
which
means
wilhelmina
virtue
would
obtain
a
complete
triumph
our
adventurer
who
overheard
the
conversation
was
immediately
seized
with
a
palsy
of
fear
he
trembled
at
every
joint
the
sweat
trickled
down
his
forehead
his
teeth
began
to
chatter
his
hair
to
stand
on
end
and
he
in
his
heart
bitterly
cursed
the
daughter
petulance
the
mother
malice
together
with
his
own
precipitation
by
which
he
was
involved
in
an
adventure
so
pregnant
with
danger
and
disgrace
indeed
the
reader
may
easily
conceive
his
disorder
when
he
heard
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
and
the
german
swearing
that
he
would
make
him
food
for
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
fathom
had
come
unprepared
with
weapons
of
defence
was
naturally
an
economist
of
his
person
and
saw
himself
on
the
brink
of
forfeiting
not
only
the
promised
harvest
of
his
double
intrigue
but
also
the
reputation
of
a
man
of
honour
upon
which
all
his
future
hopes
depended
his
agony
was
therefore
unspeakable
when
the
door
flew
open
and
it
was
not
till
after
a
considerable
pause
of
recollection
that
he
perceived
the
candle
extinguished
by
the
motion
of
the
air
produced
from
the
german
sudden
irruption
this
accident
which
disconcerted
him
so
much
as
to
put
a
full
stop
to
his
charge
was
very
favourable
to
our
hero
who
summoning
all
his
presence
of
mind
crept
up
into
the
chimney
while
the
jeweller
stood
at
the
door
waiting
for
his
wife
return
with
another
light
so
that
when
the
closet
was
examined
there
was
nothing
found
to
justify
the
report
which
the
stepmother
had
made
and
the
father
after
having
made
a
slight
apology
to
wilhelmina
for
his
intrusion
retired
with
his
into
their
own
chamber
the
young
lady
who
little
thought
that
her
papa
would
have
taken
her
at
her
word
was
overwhelmed
with
confusion
and
dismay
when
she
saw
him
enter
the
closet
and
had
her
lover
been
discovered
would
in
all
probability
have
been
the
loudest
in
his
reproach
and
perhaps
have
accused
him
of
an
intention
to
rob
the
house
but
she
was
altogether
astonished
when
she
found
he
had
made
shift
to
elude
the
inquiry
of
her
parents
because
she
could
not
conceive
the
possibility
of
his
escaping
by
the
window
which
was
in
the
third
storey
at
a
prodigious
distance
from
the
ground
and
how
he
should
conceal
himself
in
the
apartment
was
a
mystery
which
she
could
by
no
means
unfold
before
her
father
and
mother
retired
she
lighted
her
lamp
on
pretence
of
being
afraid
to
be
in
the
dark
after
the
perturbation
of
spirits
she
had
undergone
and
her
room
was
no
sooner
evacuated
of
such
troublesome
visitants
than
she
secured
the
doors
and
went
in
quest
of
her
lover
accordingly
every
corner
of
the
closet
underwent
a
new
search
and
she
called
upon
his
name
with
a
soft
voice
which
she
thought
no
other
person
would
overhear
but
ferdinand
did
not
think
proper
to
gratify
her
impatience
because
he
could
not
judge
of
the
predicament
in
which
he
stood
by
the
evidence
of
all
his
senses
and
would
not
relinquish
his
post
until
he
should
be
better
certified
that
the
coast
was
clear
meanwhile
his
dulcinea
having
performed
her
inquiry
to
no
purpose
imagined
there
was
something
preternatural
in
the
circumstance
of
his
vanishing
so
unaccountably
and
began
to
cross
herself
with
great
devotion
she
returned
to
her
chamber
fixed
the
lamp
in
the
fireplace
and
throwing
herself
upon
the
bed
gave
way
to
the
suggestions
of
her
superstition
which
were
reinforced
by
the
silence
that
prevailed
and
the
gloomy
glimmering
of
the
light
she
reflected
upon
the
trespass
she
had
already
committed
in
her
heart
and
in
the
conjectures
of
her
fear
believed
that
her
lover
was
no
other
than
the
devil
himself
who
had
assumed
the
appearance
of
fathom
in
order
to
tempt
and
seduce
her
virtue
while
her
imagination
teemed
with
those
horrible
ideas
our
adventurer
concluding
from
the
general
stillness
that
the
jeweller
and
his
wife
were
at
last
happily
asleep
ventured
to
come
forth
from
his
and
stood
before
his
mistress
all
begrimed
with
soot
wilhelmina
lifting
up
her
eyes
and
seeing
this
sable
apparition
which
she
mistook
for
satan
in
propria
persona
instantly
screamed
and
began
to
repeat
her
with
an
audible
voice
upon
which
ferdinand
foreseeing
that
her
parents
would
be
again
alarmed
would
not
stay
to
undeceive
her
and
explain
himself
but
unlocking
the
door
with
great
expedition
ran
downstairs
and
luckily
accomplished
his
escape
this
was
undoubtedly
the
wisest
measure
he
could
have
taken
for
he
had
not
performed
one
half
of
his
descent
toward
the
street
when
the
german
was
at
his
daughter
bedside
demanding
to
know
the
cause
of
her
exclamation
she
then
gave
him
an
account
of
what
she
had
seen
with
all
the
exaggerations
of
her
own
fancy
and
after
having
weighed
the
circumstances
of
her
story
he
interpreted
the
apparition
into
a
thief
who
had
found
means
to
open
the
door
that
communicated
with
the
stair
but
having
been
scared
by
wilhelmina
shriek
had
been
obliged
to
retreat
before
he
could
execute
his
purpose
our
hero
spirits
were
so
wofully
disturbed
by
this
adventure
that
for
a
whole
week
he
felt
no
inclination
to
visit
his
inamorata
and
was
not
without
apprehension
that
the
affair
had
terminated
in
an
explanation
very
little
to
his
advantage
he
was
however
delivered
from
this
disagreeable
suspense
by
an
accidental
meeting
with
the
jeweller
himself
who
kindly
chid
him
for
his
long
absence
and
entertained
him
in
the
street
with
an
account
of
the
alarm
which
his
family
had
sustained
by
a
thief
who
broke
into
wilhelmina
apartment
glad
to
find
his
apprehension
mistaken
he
renewed
his
correspondence
with
the
family
and
in
a
little
time
found
reason
to
console
himself
for
the
jeopardy
and
panic
he
had
undergone
chapter
fourteen
he
is
reduced
to
a
dreadful
dilemma
in
consequence
of
an
assignation
with
the
wife
nor
was
his
whole
care
and
attention
engrossed
by
the
execution
of
this
scheme
upon
the
daughter
while
he
managed
his
concerns
in
that
quarter
with
incredible
ardour
and
application
he
was
not
the
less
indefatigable
in
the
prosecution
of
his
design
upon
the
which
he
forwarded
with
all
his
art
during
those
opportunities
he
enjoyed
in
the
absence
of
wilhelmina
who
was
frequently
called
away
by
the
domestic
duties
of
the
house
the
passions
of
the
jeweller
wife
were
in
such
a
state
of
exaltation
as
exempted
our
hero
from
the
repulses
and
fatigue
attending
a
long
siege
we
have
already
observed
how
cunningly
he
catered
for
the
gratification
of
her
ruling
appetite
and
have
exhibited
pregnant
proofs
of
his
ability
in
gaining
upon
the
human
heart
the
reader
will
not
therefore
be
surprised
at
the
rapidity
of
his
conquest
over
the
affections
of
a
lady
whose
complexion
was
perfectly
amorous
and
whose
vanity
laid
her
open
to
all
the
attempts
of
adulation
in
a
word
matters
were
quickly
brought
to
such
a
mutual
understanding
that
one
evening
while
they
amused
themselves
at
lansquenet
fathom
conjured
her
to
give
him
the
rendezvous
next
day
at
the
house
of
any
third
person
of
her
own
sex
in
whose
discretion
she
could
confide
and
after
a
few
affected
scruples
on
her
side
which
he
well
knew
how
to
surmount
she
complied
with
his
request
and
the
circumstances
of
the
appointment
were
settled
accordingly
after
this
treaty
their
satisfaction
rose
to
such
a
warmth
and
the
conversation
became
so
reciprocally
endearing
that
our
gallant
expressed
his
impatience
of
waiting
so
long
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
wishes
and
with
the
most
eager
transport
begged
she
would
if
possible
curtail
the
term
of
his
expectation
that
his
brain
might
not
suffer
by
his
standing
so
many
tedious
hours
on
the
giddy
verge
of
rapture
the
dame
who
was
naturally
compassionate
sympathised
with
his
condition
and
unable
to
resist
his
pathetic
supplications
gave
him
to
understand
that
his
desire
could
not
be
granted
without
subjecting
them
both
to
some
hazard
but
that
she
was
disposed
to
run
any
risk
in
behalf
of
his
happiness
and
peace
after
this
affectionate
preamble
she
told
him
that
her
husband
was
then
engaged
in
a
quarterly
meeting
of
the
jewellers
from
whence
he
never
failed
to
return
quite
overwhelmed
with
wine
tobacco
and
the
phlegm
of
his
own
constitution
so
that
he
would
fall
fast
asleep
as
soon
as
his
head
should
touch
the
pillow
and
she
be
at
liberty
to
entertain
the
lover
without
interruption
provided
he
could
find
means
to
deceive
the
jealous
vigilance
of
wilhelmina
and
conceal
himself
in
some
corner
of
the
house
unsuspected
and
unperceived
our
lover
remembering
his
adventure
with
the
daughter
would
have
willingly
dispensed
with
this
expedient
and
began
to
repent
of
the
eagerness
with
which
he
had
preferred
his
solicitation
but
seeing
there
was
now
no
opportunity
of
retracting
with
honour
he
affected
to
enter
heartily
into
the
conversation
and
after
much
canvassing
it
was
determined
that
while
wilhelmina
was
employed
in
the
kitchen
the
mother
should
conduct
our
adventurer
to
the
outer
door
where
he
should
pay
the
compliment
of
parting
so
as
to
be
overheard
by
the
young
lady
but
in
the
meantime
glide
softly
into
the
jeweller
bedchamber
which
was
a
place
they
imagined
least
liable
to
the
effects
of
a
prying
disposition
and
conceal
himself
in
a
large
press
or
wardrobe
that
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
apartment
the
scene
was
immediately
acted
with
great
success
and
our
hero
cooped
up
in
his
cage
where
he
waited
so
long
that
his
desires
began
to
subside
and
his
imagination
to
aggravate
the
danger
of
his
situation
suppose
said
he
to
himself
this
brutal
german
instead
of
being
stupefied
with
wine
should
come
home
inflamed
with
brandy
to
the
use
of
which
he
is
sometimes
addicted
far
from
feeling
any
inclination
to
sleep
he
will
labour
under
the
most
fretful
anxiety
of
watching
every
irascible
particle
in
his
disposition
will
be
exasperated
he
will
be
offended
with
every
object
that
may
present
itself
to
his
view
and
if
there
is
the
least
ingredient
of
jealousy
in
his
temper
it
will
manifest
itself
in
riot
and
rage
what
if
his
frenzy
should
prompt
him
to
search
his
wife
chamber
for
gallants
this
would
certainly
be
the
first
place
to
which
he
would
direct
his
inquiry
or
granting
this
supposition
chimerical
i
may
be
seized
with
an
irresistible
inclination
to
cough
before
he
is
oppressed
with
sleep
he
may
be
waked
by
the
noise
i
shall
make
in
disengaging
myself
from
this
embarrassed
situation
and
finally
i
may
find
it
impracticable
to
retire
unseen
or
unheard
after
everything
else
shall
have
succeeded
to
my
wish
these
suggestions
did
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
quiet
of
our
adventurer
who
having
waited
three
whole
hours
in
the
most
uncomfortable
suspense
heard
the
jeweller
brought
into
the
room
in
that
very
condition
which
his
fears
had
prognosticated
he
had
it
seems
quarrelled
over
his
cups
with
another
tradesman
and
received
a
salutation
on
the
forehead
with
a
candlestick
which
not
only
left
an
ignominious
and
painful
mark
upon
his
countenance
but
even
disordered
his
brain
to
a
very
dangerous
degree
of
delirium
so
that
instead
of
allowing
himself
quietly
to
be
undressed
and
put
to
bed
by
his
wife
he
answered
all
her
gentle
admonitions
and
caresses
with
the
most
opprobrious
invectives
and
obstreperous
behaviour
and
though
he
did
not
tax
her
with
infidelity
to
his
bed
he
virulently
accused
her
of
extravagance
and
want
of
economy
observed
her
expensive
way
of
living
would
bring
him
to
a
morsel
of
bread
and
unfortunately
recollecting
the
attempt
of
the
supposed
thief
started
up
from
his
chair
swearing
by
g
mother
that
he
would
forthwith
arm
himself
with
a
brace
of
pistols
and
search
every
apartment
in
the
house
that
press
said
he
with
great
vociferation
may
for
aught
i
know
be
the
receptacle
of
some
ruffian
so
saying
he
approached
the
ark
in
which
fathom
was
embarked
and
exclaiming
come
forth
satan
applied
his
foot
to
the
door
of
it
with
such
violence
as
threw
him
from
the
centre
of
gravity
and
laid
him
sprawling
on
his
back
this
address
made
such
an
impression
upon
our
adventurer
that
he
had
obeyed
the
summons
and
burst
from
his
concealment
in
a
desperate
effort
to
escape
without
being
recognised
by
the
intoxicated
german
and
indeed
had
the
application
been
repeated
he
in
all
likelihood
would
have
tried
the
experiment
for
by
this
time
his
terrors
had
waxed
too
strong
to
be
much
longer
suppressed
from
this
hazardous
enterprise
he
was
however
exempted
by
a
lucky
accident
that
happened
to
his
disturber
whose
head
chancing
to
pitch
upon
the
corner
of
a
chair
in
his
fall
he
was
immediately
lulled
into
a
trance
during
which
the
considerate
lady
guessing
the
disorder
of
her
gallant
and
dreading
further
interruption
very
prudently
released
him
from
his
confinement
after
she
had
put
out
the
light
and
in
the
dark
conveyed
him
to
the
door
where
he
was
comforted
with
the
promise
that
she
would
punctually
remember
the
rendezvous
of
next
day
she
then
invoked
the
assistance
of
the
servants
who
being
waked
for
the
purpose
lifted
up
their
master
and
tumbled
him
into
bed
while
ferdinand
hied
him
home
in
an
universal
sweat
blessing
himself
from
any
future
achievement
of
that
sort
in
a
house
where
he
had
been
twice
in
such
imminent
danger
of
life
and
reputation
nevertheless
he
did
not
fail
to
honour
the
assignation
and
avail
himself
of
the
disposition
his
mistress
manifested
to
make
him
all
the
recompense
in
her
power
for
the
disappointment
and
chagrin
which
he
had
undergone
chapter
fifteen
but
at
length
succeeds
in
his
attempt
upon
both
having
thus
gained
a
complete
victory
over
the
affections
of
these
two
ladies
he
began
to
convert
his
good
fortune
to
the
purposes
of
that
principle
from
which
his
view
was
never
no
not
for
a
moment
detached
in
other
words
he
used
them
as
ministers
and
purveyors
to
his
avarice
and
fraud
as
for
the
she
was
of
herself
so
liberal
as
to
anticipate
the
wishes
of
any
moderate
adventurer
and
presented
him
with
sundry
valuable
jewels
as
memorials
of
her
esteem
nor
was
the
daughter
backward
in
such
expressions
of
regard
she
already
considered
his
interest
as
her
own
and
took
frequent
opportunities
of
secreting
for
his
benefit
certain
stray
trinkets
that
she
happened
to
pick
up
in
her
excursions
within
doors
all
these
gratifications
he
received
with
demonstrations
of
infinite
constraint
and
reluctance
and
in
the
midst
of
his
rapacious
extortion
acted
so
cunningly
as
to
impose
himself
upon
both
for
a
miracle
of
disinterested
integrity
yet
not
contented
with
what
he
thus
could
earn
and
despairing
of
being
able
to
steer
the
bark
of
his
fortune
for
any
length
of
time
between
two
such
dangerous
quicksands
he
resolved
to
profit
by
the
occasion
while
it
lasted
and
strike
some
considerable
stroke
at
once
a
plan
was
formed
in
consequence
of
this
determination
and
at
an
appointment
with
the
mother
in
the
house
of
their
female
friend
our
adventurer
appeared
with
an
air
of
dejection
which
he
veiled
with
a
thin
cover
of
forced
pleasantry
that
his
mistress
might
suppose
he
endeavoured
to
conceal
some
mortal
chagrin
that
preyed
upon
his
heart
the
stratagem
succeeded
to
his
wish
she
observed
his
countenance
between
whiles
overcast
took
notice
of
the
involuntary
sighs
he
heaved
and
with
the
most
tender
expressions
of
sympathy
conjured
him
to
make
her
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
his
affliction
instead
of
gratifying
her
request
immediately
he
evaded
her
questions
with
a
respectful
reserve
implying
that
his
love
would
not
suffer
him
to
make
her
a
partner
in
his
sorrow
and
this
delicacy
on
his
part
whetted
her
impatience
and
concern
to
such
a
degree
that
rather
than
keep
her
in
such
an
agony
of
doubt
and
apprehension
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
tell
her
that
he
had
been
the
preceding
night
engaged
with
a
company
of
his
where
he
had
made
too
free
with
the
champagne
so
that
his
caution
forsook
him
and
he
had
been
decoyed
into
play
by
a
tyrolese
gamester
who
stripped
him
of
all
his
ready
money
and
obtained
from
him
an
obligation
for
two
hundred
florins
which
he
could
not
possibly
pay
without
having
recourse
to
his
relation
the
count
de
melvil
who
would
have
just
cause
to
be
incensed
at
his
extravagance
this
information
he
concluded
by
declaring
that
cost
what
it
would
he
was
resolved
to
make
a
candid
confession
of
the
truth
and
throw
himself
entirely
upon
the
generosity
of
his
patron
who
could
inflict
no
other
punishment
than
that
of
discarding
him
from
his
favour
and
protection
a
misfortune
which
how
grievous
soever
it
might
be
he
should
be
able
to
sustain
with
fortitude
could
he
fall
upon
some
method
of
satisfying
the
tyrolese
who
was
very
importunate
and
savage
in
his
demand
his
kind
mistress
no
sooner
found
out
the
source
of
his
inquietude
than
she
promised
to
dry
it
up
assuring
him
that
next
day
at
the
same
hour
she
would
enable
him
to
discharge
the
debt
so
that
he
might
set
his
heart
at
ease
and
recollect
that
gaiety
which
was
the
soul
of
her
enjoyment
he
expressed
the
utmost
astonishment
at
this
generous
proffer
which
however
he
declined
with
an
affected
earnestness
of
refusal
protesting
that
he
should
be
extremely
mortified
if
he
thought
she
looked
upon
him
as
one
of
those
mercenary
gallants
who
could
make
such
a
sordid
use
of
a
lady
affection
no
madam
cried
our
politician
in
a
pathetic
strain
whatever
happens
i
shall
never
part
with
that
internal
consolation
that
conscious
honour
never
fails
to
yield
in
the
deepest
scenes
of
solitary
distress
the
attachment
i
have
the
honour
to
profess
for
your
amiable
person
is
not
founded
on
such
inglorious
motives
but
is
the
genuine
result
of
that
generous
passion
which
none
but
the
feel
and
the
only
circumstance
of
this
misfortune
that
i
dread
to
encounter
is
the
necessity
of
withdrawing
myself
for
ever
from
the
presence
of
her
whose
genial
smiles
could
animate
my
soul
against
all
the
persecution
of
adverse
fortune
this
declamation
accompanied
with
a
profound
sigh
served
only
to
inflame
her
desire
of
extricating
him
from
the
difficulty
in
which
he
was
involved
she
exhausted
all
her
eloquence
in
attempting
to
persuade
him
that
his
refusal
was
an
outrage
against
her
affection
he
pretended
to
refute
her
arguments
and
remained
unshaken
by
all
the
power
of
her
solicitations
until
she
had
recourse
to
the
most
passionate
remonstrances
of
love
and
fell
at
his
feet
in
the
posture
of
a
forlorn
shepherdess
what
he
refused
to
her
reason
he
granted
to
her
tears
because
his
heart
was
melted
by
her
affliction
and
next
day
condescended
to
accept
of
her
money
out
of
pure
regard
to
her
happiness
and
peace
encouraged
by
the
success
of
this
achievement
he
resolved
to
practise
the
same
experiment
upon
wilhelmina
in
hope
of
extracting
an
equal
share
of
profit
from
her
simplicity
and
attachment
and
at
their
very
next
nocturnal
rendezvous
in
her
chamber
reacted
the
farce
already
rehearsed
with
a
small
variation
which
he
thought
necessary
to
stimulate
the
young
lady
in
his
behalf
he
rightly
concluded
that
she
was
by
no
means
mistress
of
such
a
considerable
sum
as
he
had
already
extorted
from
her
mother
and
therefore
thought
proper
to
represent
himself
in
the
most
urgent
predicament
that
her
apprehension
on
his
account
might
be
so
alarmed
as
to
engage
her
in
some
enterprise
for
his
advantage
which
otherwise
she
would
never
have
dreamed
of
undertaking
with
this
view
after
having
described
his
own
calamitous
situation
in
consequence
of
her
pressing
entreaties
which
he
affected
to
evade
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
there
was
no
person
upon
earth
to
whom
he
would
have
recourse
in
this
emergency
for
which
reason
he
was
determined
to
rid
himself
of
all
his
cares
at
once
upon
the
friendly
point
of
his
own
faithful
sword
such
a
dreadful
resolution
could
not
fail
to
operate
upon
the
tender
passions
of
his
dulcinea
she
was
instantly
seized
with
an
agony
of
fear
and
distraction
her
grief
manifested
itself
in
a
flood
of
tears
while
she
hung
round
his
neck
conjuring
him
in
the
most
melting
terms
by
their
mutual
love
in
which
they
had
been
so
happy
to
lay
aside
that
fatal
determination
which
would
infallibly
involve
her
in
the
same
fate
for
she
took
heaven
to
witness
that
she
would
not
one
moment
survive
the
knowledge
of
his
death
he
was
not
deficient
in
expressions
of
reciprocal
regard
he
extolled
her
love
and
tenderness
with
a
most
extravagant
eulogium
and
seemed
wrung
with
mortal
anguish
at
the
prospect
of
parting
for
ever
from
his
lovely
wilhelmina
but
his
honour
was
a
stern
and
rigid
creditor
that
could
not
be
appeased
except
with
his
blood
and
all
the
boon
she
could
obtain
by
dint
of
the
most
woful
supplication
was
a
promise
to
defer
the
execution
of
his
baleful
purpose
for
the
space
of
hours
during
which
she
hoped
heaven
would
compassionate
her
sufferings
and
inspire
her
with
some
contrivance
for
their
mutual
relief
thus
he
yielded
to
her
fervent
request
rather
with
a
view
to
calm
the
present
transports
of
her
sorrow
than
with
any
expectation
of
seeing
himself
redeemed
from
his
fate
by
her
interposition
such
at
least
were
his
professions
when
he
took
his
leave
assuring
her
that
he
would
not
quit
his
being
before
he
should
have
devoted
a
few
hours
to
another
interview
with
the
dear
object
of
his
love
having
thus
kindled
the
train
he
did
not
doubt
that
the
mine
of
his
craft
would
take
effect
and
repaired
to
his
own
lodging
in
full
persuasion
of
seeing
his
aim
accomplished
before
the
time
fixed
for
their
last
assignation
his
prognostic
was
next
morning
verified
by
the
arrival
of
a
messenger
who
brought
to
him
a
small
parcel
to
which
was
cemented
with
sealing
wax
the
following
epistle
jewel
of
my
soul
scarce
had
you
last
night
quitted
my
disconsolate
arms
when
i
happily
recollected
that
there
was
in
my
possession
a
gold
chain
of
value
more
than
sufficient
to
answer
the
exigence
of
your
present
occasions
it
was
pledged
to
my
grandfather
for
two
hundred
crowns
by
a
knight
of
malta
who
soon
after
perished
in
a
sea
engagement
with
the
enemies
of
our
faith
so
that
it
became
the
property
of
our
house
and
was
bequeathed
to
me
by
the
old
gentleman
as
a
memorial
of
his
particular
affection
upon
whom
can
i
more
properly
bestow
it
than
him
who
is
already
master
of
my
heart
receive
it
therefore
from
the
bearer
of
this
billet
and
convert
it
without
scruple
to
that
use
which
shall
be
most
conducive
to
your
ease
and
satisfaction
nor
seek
from
a
true
romantic
notion
of
honour
which
i
know
you
entertain
to
excuse
yourself
from
accepting
this
testimony
of
my
affection
for
i
have
already
sworn
before
an
image
of
our
blessed
lady
that
i
will
no
longer
own
you
as
the
sovereign
of
my
heart
nor
even
indulge
you
with
another
interview
if
you
reject
this
mark
of
tenderness
and
concern
from
your
ever
faithful
wilhelmina
the
heart
of
our
adventurer
began
to
bound
with
joy
when
he
surveyed
the
contents
of
this
letter
and
his
eyes
sparkled
with
transport
at
sight
of
the
chain
which
he
immediately
perceived
to
be
worth
twice
the
sum
she
had
mentioned
nevertheless
he
would
not
avail
himself
without
further
question
of
her
generosity
but
that
same
night
repairing
to
her
apartment
at
the
usual
hour
of
meeting
he
prostrated
himself
before
her
and
counterfeiting
extreme
agitation
of
spirit
begged
in
the
most
urgent
terms
not
even
unaccompanied
with
tears
that
she
would
take
back
the
present
which
he
tendered
for
her
acceptance
and
spare
him
the
most
insufferable
mortification
of
thinking
himself
exposed
to
the
imputation
of
being
mercenary
in
his
love
such
he
said
was
the
delicacy
of
his
passion
that
he
could
not
possibly
exist
under
the
apprehension
of
incurring
a
censure
so
unworthy
of
his
sentiments
and
he
would
a
thousand
times
sooner
undergo
the
persecution
of
his
rancorous
creditor
than
bear
the
thought
of
being
in
the
smallest
consideration
lessened
in
her
esteem
nay
so
far
did
he
carry
his
pretensions
to
punctilio
as
to
protest
that
should
she
refuse
to
quiet
the
scruples
of
his
honour
on
this
score
her
unyielding
beneficence
would
serve
only
to
hasten
the
execution
of
his
determined
purpose
to
withdraw
himself
at
once
from
a
life
of
vanity
and
misfortune
the
more
pathetically
he
pleaded
for
her
compliance
the
more
strenuously
did
she
resist
his
remonstrances
she
advanced
all
the
arguments
her
reason
love
and
terror
could
suggest
reminded
him
of
her
oath
from
which
he
could
not
suppose
she
would
recede
whatever
the
consequence
might
be
and
in
conclusion
vowed
to
heaven
with
great
solemnity
and
devotion
that
she
would
not
survive
the
news
of
his
death
thus
the
alternative
she
offered
was
either
to
retain
the
chain
and
be
happy
in
her
affection
or
forfeit
all
title
to
her
love
and
die
in
the
conviction
of
having
brought
his
innocent
mistress
to
an
untimely
grave
his
fortitude
was
not
proof
against
this
last
consideration
my
savage
honour
said
he
would
enable
me
to
endure
the
pangs
of
eternal
separation
in
the
confidence
of
being
endowed
with
the
power
of
ending
these
tortures
by
the
energy
of
my
own
hand
but
the
prospect
of
wilhelmina
death
and
that
too
occasioned
by
my
inflexibility
disarms
my
soul
of
all
her
resolution
swallows
up
the
dictates
of
my
jealous
pride
and
fills
my
bosom
with
such
a
gush
of
tenderness
and
sorrow
as
overwhelms
the
whole
economy
of
my
purpose
yes
enchanting
creature
i
sacrifice
my
glory
to
that
irresistible
reflection
and
rather
than
know
myself
the
cruel
instrument
of
robbing
the
world
of
such
perfection
consent
to
retain
the
fatal
testimony
of
your
love
so
saying
he
pocketed
the
chain
with
an
air
of
ineffable
mortification
and
was
rewarded
for
his
compliance
with
the
most
endearing
caresses
of
his
dulcinea
who
amidst
the
tumults
of
her
joy
ejaculated
a
thousand
acknowledgments
to
heaven
for
having
blessed
her
with
the
affection
of
such
a
man
whose
honour
was
unrivalled
by
anything
but
his
love
chapter
sixteen
his
success
begets
a
blind
security
by
which
he
is
once
again
entrapped
in
his
dulcinea
apartment
in
this
manner
did
the
crafty
fathom
turn
to
account
those
ingratiating
qualifications
he
inherited
from
nature
and
maintain
with
incredible
assiduity
and
circumspection
an
amorous
correspondence
with
two
domestic
rivals
who
watched
the
conduct
of
each
other
with
the
most
indefatigable
virulence
of
envious
suspicion
until
an
accident
happened
which
had
overturned
the
bark
of
his
policy
and
induced
him
to
alter
the
course
that
he
might
not
be
shipwrecked
on
the
rocks
that
began
to
multiply
in
the
prosecution
of
his
present
voyage
the
jeweller
who
as
a
german
wanted
neither
pride
nor
ostentation
never
failed
to
celebrate
the
anniversary
of
his
birth
by
an
annual
feast
granted
to
his
neighbours
and
friends
and
on
these
occasions
was
accustomed
to
wear
that
chain
which
though
bequeathed
to
his
daughter
he
considered
as
an
ornament
appertaining
to
the
family
whereof
he
himself
was
head
accordingly
when
the
time
of
this
festival
revolved
he
as
usual
ordered
wilhelmina
to
surrender
it
for
the
day
this
injunction
the
reader
will
perceive
our
young
lady
was
in
no
condition
to
obey
she
had
however
foreseen
the
demand
and
contrived
a
scheme
of
behaviour
for
the
occasion
which
she
forthwith
put
in
execution
with
an
air
of
uncommon
cheerfulness
purposely
assumed
she
retired
to
her
closet
on
pretence
of
complying
with
his
desire
and
having
employed
a
few
minutes
in
rummaging
her
drawers
and
disordering
her
moveables
uttered
a
loud
shriek
that
brought
her
father
instantly
into
the
apartment
where
he
found
his
daughter
tossing
about
her
clothes
and
trinkets
with
violent
demonstrations
of
disorder
and
affright
and
heard
her
in
a
lamentable
strain
declare
that
she
was
robbed
of
her
chain
and
for
ever
undone
this
was
so
far
from
being
an
agreeable
intimation
to
the
jeweller
that
he
was
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
and
vexation
and
it
was
not
till
after
a
long
pause
that
he
pronounced
the
word
sacrament
with
an
emphasis
denoting
the
most
mortifying
surprise
soon
as
that
exclamation
escaped
from
his
lips
he
flew
to
the
escritoire
as
if
instinctively
and
joining
wilhelmina
in
her
occupation
tumbled
its
whole
contents
upon
the
floor
in
a
trice
while
he
was
thus
employed
in
the
most
expressive
silence
the
wife
of
his
bosom
chanced
to
pass
that
way
and
seeing
them
both
occupied
with
such
violence
and
trepidation
believed
at
first
that
they
were
certainly
actuated
by
the
spirit
of
frenzy
but
when
she
interposed
by
asking
with
great
earnestness
the
cause
of
such
transports
and
distracted
behaviour
and
heard
her
husband
reply
with
an
accent
of
despair
the
chain
the
chain
of
my
forefathers
is
no
more
she
immediately
justified
his
emotion
by
undergoing
the
same
alarm
and
without
further
hesitation
engaged
herself
in
the
search
beginning
with
a
song
which
might
be
compared
to
the
hymn
of
battle
among
the
greeks
or
rather
more
aptly
to
that
which
the
spartan
females
sung
round
the
altar
of
diana
surnamed
orthian
for
it
was
attended
with
strange
gesticulations
and
in
the
course
of
utterance
became
so
loud
and
shrill
that
the
guests
who
were
by
this
time
partly
assembled
being
confounded
at
the
clamour
rushed
towards
the
place
from
whence
it
seemed
to
proceed
and
found
their
landlord
with
his
wife
and
daughter
in
the
attitudes
of
distraction
and
despair
when
they
understood
the
nature
of
the
case
they
condoled
the
family
on
their
misfortune
and
would
have
retired
on
the
supposition
that
it
would
defeat
the
mirthful
intent
of
their
meeting
but
the
jeweller
mustering
up
his
whole
temper
and
hospitality
entreated
them
to
excuse
his
disorder
and
favour
him
with
their
company
which
he
observed
was
now
more
than
ever
wanted
to
dispel
the
melancholy
ideas
inspired
by
his
loss
notwithstanding
this
apology
and
the
efforts
he
made
in
the
sequel
to
entertain
his
friends
with
jollity
and
his
heart
was
so
linked
to
the
chain
that
he
could
not
detach
himself
from
the
thoughts
of
it
which
invaded
him
at
short
intervals
in
such
qualms
as
effectually
spoiled
his
appetite
and
hindered
his
digestion
he
revolved
within
himself
the
circumstances
of
his
disaster
and
in
canvassing
all
the
probable
means
by
which
the
chain
would
be
stolen
concluded
that
the
deed
must
have
been
done
by
some
person
in
the
family
who
in
consequence
of
having
access
to
his
daughter
chamber
had
either
found
the
drawer
left
open
by
her
carelessness
and
neglect
or
found
means
to
obtain
a
false
key
by
some
waxen
impression
for
the
locks
of
the
escritoire
were
safe
and
uninjured
his
suspicion
being
thus
confined
within
his
own
house
sometimes
pitched
upon
his
workmen
and
sometimes
upon
his
wife
who
he
thought
was
the
more
likely
to
practise
such
finesse
as
she
considered
wilhelmina
in
the
light
of
a
whose
interest
interfered
with
her
own
and
who
had
often
harangued
to
him
in
private
on
the
folly
of
leaving
this
very
chain
in
the
young
lady
possession
the
more
he
considered
this
subject
he
thought
he
saw
the
more
reason
to
attribute
the
damage
he
had
sustained
to
the
machinations
of
his
spouse
who
he
did
not
doubt
was
disposed
to
feather
her
own
nest
at
the
expense
of
him
and
his
heirs
and
who
with
the
same
honest
intention
had
already
secreted
for
her
private
use
those
inconsiderable
jewels
which
of
late
had
at
different
times
been
missing
aroused
by
these
sentiments
he
resolved
to
retaliate
her
own
schemes
by
contriving
means
to
visit
her
cabinet
in
secret
and
if
possible
to
rob
the
robber
of
the
spoils
she
had
gathered
to
his
prejudice
without
coming
to
any
explanation
which
might
end
in
domestic
turmoils
and
eternal
disquiet
while
the
husband
exercised
his
reflection
in
this
manner
his
innocent
mate
did
not
allow
the
powers
of
her
imagination
to
rest
in
idleness
and
sloth
her
observations
touching
the
loss
of
the
chain
were
such
as
a
suspicious
woman
biassed
by
hatred
and
envy
would
naturally
make
to
her
it
seemed
highly
improbable
that
a
thing
of
such
value
so
carefully
deposited
should
vanish
without
the
connivance
of
its
keeper
and
without
much
expense
of
conjecture
divined
the
true
manner
in
which
it
was
conveyed
the
sole
difficulty
that
occurred
in
the
researches
of
her
sagacity
was
to
know
the
gallant
who
had
been
favoured
with
such
a
pledge
of
wilhelmina
affection
for
as
the
reader
will
easily
imagine
she
never
dreamed
of
viewing
ferdinand
in
that
odious
perspective
in
order
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
discover
this
happy
favourite
and
be
revenged
on
her
petulant
rival
she
prevailed
upon
the
jeweller
to
employ
a
scout
who
should
watch
all
night
upon
the
stair
without
the
knowledge
of
any
other
person
in
the
family
alleging
that
in
all
likelihood
the
housemaid
gave
private
admittance
to
some
lover
who
was
the
author
of
all
the
losses
they
had
lately
suffered
and
that
they
might
possibly
detect
him
in
his
nocturnal
adventures
and
observing
that
it
would
be
imprudent
to
intimate
their
design
to
wilhelmina
lest
through
the
heedlessness
and
indiscretion
of
youth
she
might
chance
to
divulge
the
secret
so
as
to
frustrate
their
aim
a
swiss
in
whose
honesty
the
german
could
confide
being
hired
for
this
purpose
was
posted
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
staircase
within
a
few
paces
of
the
door
which
he
was
directed
to
watch
and
actually
stood
sentinel
three
nights
without
perceiving
the
least
object
of
suspicion
but
on
the
fourth
the
evil
stars
of
our
adventurer
conducted
him
to
the
spot
on
his
voyage
to
the
apartment
of
his
dulcinea
with
whom
he
had
preconcerted
the
assignation
having
made
the
signal
which
consisted
of
two
gentle
taps
on
her
door
he
was
immediately
admitted
and
the
swiss
no
sooner
saw
him
fairly
housed
than
he
crept
softly
to
the
other
door
that
was
left
open
for
the
purpose
and
gave
immediate
intimation
of
what
he
had
perceived
this
intelligence
however
he
could
not
convey
so
secretly
but
the
lovers
who
were
always
vigilant
upon
these
occasions
overheard
a
sort
of
commotion
in
the
jeweller
chamber
the
cause
of
which
their
apprehension
was
ingenious
enough
to
comprehend
we
have
formerly
observed
that
our
adventurer
could
not
make
his
retreat
by
the
door
without
running
a
very
great
risk
of
being
detected
and
the
expedient
of
the
chimney
he
had
no
inclination
to
repeat
so
that
he
found
himself
in
a
very
uncomfortable
dilemma
and
was
utterly
abandoned
by
all
his
invention
and
address
when
his
mistress
in
a
whisper
desired
him
to
begin
a
dialogue
aloud
in
an
apology
importing
that
he
had
mistaken
the
door
and
that
his
intention
was
to
visit
her
father
touching
a
ring
belonging
to
the
young
count
melvil
which
she
knew
fathom
had
put
into
his
hands
in
order
to
be
altered
ferdinand
seizing
the
hint
availed
himself
of
it
without
delay
and
unbolting
the
door
pronounced
in
an
audible
voice
upon
my
honour
mademoiselle
you
wrong
my
intention
if
you
imagine
i
came
hither
with
any
disrespectful
or
dishonourable
motive
i
have
business
with
your
father
which
can
not
be
delayed
till
without
manifest
prejudice
to
my
friend
and
myself
therefore
i
took
the
liberty
of
visiting
him
at
these
untimely
hours
and
it
has
been
my
misfortune
to
mistake
the
door
in
the
dark
i
beg
pardon
for
my
involuntary
intrusion
and
again
assure
you
that
nothing
was
farther
from
my
thoughts
than
any
design
to
violate
that
respect
which
i
have
always
entertained
for
you
and
your
father
family
to
this
remonstrance
which
was
distinctly
heard
by
the
german
and
his
wife
who
by
this
time
stood
listening
at
the
door
the
young
lady
replied
in
a
shrill
accent
of
displeasure
sir
i
am
bound
to
believe
that
all
your
actions
are
conducted
by
honour
but
you
must
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
that
your
mistake
is
a
little
extraordinary
and
your
visit
even
to
my
father
at
this
time
of
the
night
altogether
unseasonable
if
not
mysterious
as
for
the
interruption
i
have
suffered
in
my
repose
i
impute
it
to
my
own
forgetfulness
in
leaving
my
door
unlocked
and
blame
myself
so
severely
for
the
omission
that
i
shall
put
it
out
of
my
own
power
to
be
guilty
of
the
like
for
the
future
by
ordering
the
passage
to
be
nailed
up
meanwhile
if
you
would
persuade
me
of
your
you
will
instantly
withdraw
lest
my
reputation
should
suffer
by
your
continuance
in
my
apartment
madam
answered
our
hero
i
will
not
give
you
an
opportunity
to
repeat
the
command
which
i
shall
forthwith
obey
after
having
entreated
you
once
more
to
forgive
the
disturbance
i
have
given
so
saying
he
gently
opened
the
door
and
at
sight
of
the
german
and
his
wife
who
he
well
knew
waited
for
his
exit
started
back
and
gave
tokens
of
confusion
which
was
partly
real
and
partly
affected
the
jeweller
fully
satisfied
with
fathom
declaration
to
his
daughter
received
him
with
a
complaisant
look
and
in
order
to
alleviate
his
concern
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
already
knew
the
reason
of
his
being
in
that
apartment
and
desired
to
be
informed
of
what
had
procured
him
the
honour
to
see
him
at
such
a
juncture
my
dear
friend
said
our
adventurer
pretending
to
recollect
himself
with
difficulty
i
am
utterly
ashamed
and
confounded
to
be
discovered
in
this
situation
but
as
you
have
overheard
what
passed
between
mademoiselle
and
me
i
know
you
will
do
justice
to
my
intention
and
forgive
my
mistake
after
begging
pardon
for
having
intruded
upon
your
family
at
these
hours
i
must
now
tell
you
that
my
cousin
count
melvil
was
some
time
ago
so
much
misrepresented
to
his
mother
by
certain
malicious
informers
who
delight
in
sowing
discord
in
private
families
that
she
actually
believed
her
son
an
extravagant
spendthrift
who
had
not
only
consumed
his
remittances
in
the
most
riotous
scenes
of
disorder
but
also
indulged
a
pernicious
appetite
for
gaming
to
such
a
degree
that
he
had
lost
all
his
clothes
and
jewels
at
play
in
consequence
of
such
false
information
she
expostulated
with
him
in
a
severe
letter
and
desired
he
would
transmit
to
her
that
ring
which
is
in
your
custody
it
being
a
family
stone
for
which
she
expressed
an
inestimable
value
the
young
gentleman
in
his
answer
to
her
reproof
endeavoured
to
vindicate
himself
from
the
aspersions
which
had
been
cast
upon
his
character
and
with
regard
to
the
ring
told
her
it
was
at
present
in
the
hands
of
a
jeweller
in
order
to
be
new
set
according
to
her
own
directions
and
that
whenever
it
should
be
altered
he
would
send
it
home
to
her
by
some
safe
conveyance
this
account
the
good
lady
took
for
an
evasion
and
upon
that
supposition
has
again
written
to
him
in
such
a
provoking
style
that
although
the
letter
arrived
but
half
an
hour
ago
he
is
determined
to
despatch
a
courier
before
morning
with
the
mischievous
ring
for
which
in
compliance
with
the
impetuosity
of
his
temper
i
have
taken
the
freedom
to
disturb
you
at
this
unseasonable
hour
the
german
paid
implicit
faith
to
every
circumstance
of
his
story
which
indeed
could
not
well
be
supposed
to
be
invented
extempore
the
ring
was
immediately
restored
and
our
adventurer
took
his
leave
congratulating
himself
upon
his
signal
deliverance
from
the
snare
in
which
he
had
fallen
chapter
seventeen
the
suspicions
being
awakened
she
lays
a
snare
for
our
adventurer
from
which
he
is
delivered
by
the
interposition
of
his
good
genius
though
the
husband
swallowed
the
bait
without
further
inquiry
the
penetration
of
the
wife
was
not
so
easily
deceived
that
same
dialogue
in
wilhelmina
apartment
far
from
allaying
rather
inflamed
her
suspicion
because
in
the
like
emergency
she
herself
had
once
profited
by
the
same
or
nearly
the
same
contrivance
without
communicating
her
doubts
to
the
father
she
resolved
to
double
her
attention
to
the
daughter
future
conduct
and
keep
such
a
strict
eye
over
the
behaviour
of
our
gallant
that
he
should
find
it
very
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
elude
her
observation
for
this
purpose
she
took
into
her
pay
an
old
maiden
of
the
right
sour
disposition
who
lived
in
a
house
opposite
to
her
own
and
directed
her
to
follow
the
young
lady
in
all
her
outgoings
whenever
she
should
receive
from
the
window
a
certain
signal
which
the
agreed
to
make
for
the
occasion
it
was
not
long
before
this
scheme
succeeded
to
her
wish
the
door
of
communication
betwixt
wilhelmina
apartment
and
the
staircase
being
nailed
up
by
the
jeweller
express
order
our
adventurer
was
altogether
deprived
of
those
opportunities
he
had
hitherto
enjoyed
and
was
not
at
all
mortified
to
find
himself
so
restricted
in
a
correspondence
which
began
to
be
tiresome
and
disagreeable
but
the
case
was
far
otherwise
with
his
dulcinea
whose
passion
the
more
it
was
thwarted
raged
with
greater
violence
like
a
fire
that
from
the
attempts
that
are
made
to
extinguish
it
gathers
greater
force
and
flames
with
double
fury
upon
the
second
day
of
her
misfortune
she
had
written
a
very
tender
billet
lamenting
her
unhappiness
in
being
deprived
of
those
meetings
which
constituted
the
chief
joy
of
her
life
and
entreating
him
to
contrive
some
means
of
renewing
the
delicious
commerce
in
an
unsuspected
place
this
intimation
she
proposed
to
convey
privately
into
the
hand
of
her
lover
during
his
next
visit
to
the
family
but
both
were
so
narrowly
eyed
by
the
mother
that
she
found
the
execution
of
her
design
impracticable
and
next
forenoon
on
pretence
of
going
to
church
repaired
to
the
house
of
a
companion
who
being
also
her
confidant
undertook
to
deliver
the
billet
with
her
own
hand
the
employed
by
her
mother
in
obedience
to
the
sign
which
was
displayed
from
the
window
immediately
put
on
her
veil
and
followed
wilhelmina
at
a
distance
until
she
saw
her
fairly
housed
she
would
not
even
then
return
from
her
excursion
but
hovered
about
in
sight
of
the
door
with
a
view
of
making
further
observations
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
the
young
lady
disappeared
the
scout
perceived
her
coming
out
accompanied
by
her
comrade
from
whom
she
instantly
parted
and
bent
her
way
towards
the
church
in
good
earnest
while
the
other
steered
her
course
in
another
direction
the
duenna
after
a
moment
suspense
and
consideration
divined
the
true
cause
of
this
short
visit
and
resolved
to
watch
the
motions
of
the
confidant
whom
she
traced
to
the
academy
in
which
our
hero
lodged
and
from
which
she
saw
her
return
after
the
supposed
message
was
delivered
fraught
with
this
intelligence
the
rancorous
understrapper
hied
her
home
to
the
jeweller
wife
and
made
a
faithful
recital
of
what
she
had
seen
communicating
at
the
same
time
her
own
conjectures
on
that
subject
her
employer
was
equally
astonished
and
incensed
at
this
information
she
was
seized
with
all
that
frenzy
which
takes
possession
of
a
slighted
woman
when
she
finds
herself
supplanted
by
a
detested
rival
and
in
the
first
transports
of
her
indignation
devoted
them
as
sacrifices
to
her
vengeance
nor
was
her
surprise
so
much
the
effect
of
his
dissimulation
as
of
his
want
of
taste
and
discernment
she
inveighed
against
him
not
as
the
most
treacherous
lover
but
as
the
most
abject
wretch
in
courting
the
smiles
of
such
an
awkward
dowdy
while
he
enjoyed
the
favours
of
a
woman
who
had
numbered
princes
in
the
train
of
her
admirers
for
the
brilliancy
of
her
attractions
such
as
they
at
present
shone
she
appealed
to
the
decision
of
her
minister
who
consulted
her
own
satisfaction
and
interest
by
flattering
the
other
vanity
and
resentment
and
so
unaccountable
did
the
depravity
of
our
hero
judgment
appear
to
this
conceited
dame
that
she
began
to
believe
there
was
some
mistake
in
the
person
and
to
hope
that
wilhelmina
gallant
was
not
in
reality
her
professed
admirer
fathom
but
rather
one
of
his
whose
passion
he
favoured
with
his
mediation
and
assistance
on
this
notion
which
nothing
but
mere
vanity
could
have
inspired
in
opposition
to
so
many
more
weighty
presumptions
she
took
the
resolution
of
bringing
the
affair
to
a
fuller
explanation
before
she
would
concert
any
measures
to
the
prejudice
of
our
adventurer
and
forthwith
despatched
her
spy
back
to
his
lodgings
to
solicit
on
the
part
of
wilhelmina
an
immediate
answer
to
the
letter
he
had
received
this
was
an
expedition
with
which
the
old
maiden
would
have
willingly
dispensed
because
it
was
founded
upon
an
uncertainty
which
might
be
attended
with
troublesome
consequences
but
rather
than
be
the
means
of
retarding
a
negotiation
so
productive
of
that
sort
of
mischief
which
is
particularly
agreeable
to
all
of
her
tribe
she
undertook
to
manage
and
effect
the
discovery
in
full
confidence
of
her
own
talents
and
experience
with
such
a
fund
of
and
instigation
she
repaired
to
the
academy
on
the
instant
and
inquiring
for
fathom
was
introduced
to
his
apartment
where
she
found
him
in
the
very
act
of
writing
a
billet
to
the
jeweller
daughter
the
artful
agent
having
asked
with
the
mysterious
air
of
an
expert
if
he
had
not
lately
received
a
message
from
a
certain
young
lady
and
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
gave
him
to
understand
that
she
herself
was
a
person
favoured
with
the
friendship
and
confidence
of
wilhelmina
whom
she
had
known
from
her
cradle
and
often
dandled
on
her
knee
then
in
the
genuine
style
of
a
prattling
dry
nurse
she
launched
out
in
encomiums
on
his
dulcinea
beauty
and
sweetness
of
temper
recounting
many
simple
occurrences
of
her
infancy
and
childhood
and
finally
desiring
a
more
circumstantial
answer
to
that
which
she
had
sent
to
him
by
her
friend
catherina
in
the
course
of
her
loquacity
she
had
also
according
to
her
instructions
hinted
at
the
misfortune
of
the
door
and
on
the
whole
performed
her
cue
with
such
dexterity
and
discretion
that
our
politician
was
actually
overreached
and
having
finished
his
epistle
committed
it
to
her
care
with
many
verbal
expressions
of
eternal
love
and
fidelity
to
his
charming
wilhelmina
the
messenger
doubly
rejoiced
at
her
achievement
which
not
only
recommended
her
ministry
but
also
gratified
her
malice
returned
to
her
principal
with
great
exultation
and
delivering
the
letter
the
reader
will
easily
conceive
the
transports
of
that
lady
when
she
read
the
contents
of
it
in
these
words
angelic
wilhelmina
to
forget
those
ecstatic
scenes
we
have
enjoyed
together
or
even
live
without
the
continuation
of
that
mutual
bliss
were
to
quit
all
title
to
perception
and
resign
every
hope
of
future
happiness
no
my
charmer
while
my
head
retains
the
least
spark
of
invention
and
my
heart
glows
with
the
resolution
of
a
man
our
correspondence
shall
not
be
cut
off
by
the
machinations
of
an
envious
stepmother
who
never
had
attractions
to
inspire
a
generous
passion
and
now
that
age
and
wrinkles
have
destroyed
what
little
share
of
beauty
she
once
possessed
endeavours
like
the
fiend
in
paradise
to
blast
those
joys
in
others
from
which
she
is
herself
eternally
excluded
doubt
not
dear
sovereign
of
my
soul
that
i
will
study
with
all
the
eagerness
of
desiring
love
how
to
frustrate
her
malicious
intention
and
renew
those
transporting
moments
the
remembrance
of
which
now
warms
the
breast
of
your
ever
constant
fathom
had
our
hero
murdered
her
father
or
left
her
a
disconsolate
widow
by
effecting
the
death
of
her
dear
husband
there
might
have
been
a
possibility
of
her
exerting
the
christian
virtues
of
resignation
and
forgiveness
but
such
a
personal
outrage
as
that
contained
in
this
epistle
precluded
all
hope
of
pardon
and
rendered
penitence
of
no
signification
his
atrocious
crime
being
now
fully
ascertained
this
virago
gave
a
loose
to
her
resentment
which
became
so
loud
and
tempestuous
that
her
informer
shuddered
at
the
storm
she
had
raised
and
began
to
repent
of
having
communicated
the
intelligence
which
seemed
to
have
such
a
violent
effect
upon
hex
brain
she
endeavoured
however
to
allay
the
agitation
by
flattering
her
fancy
with
the
prospect
of
revenge
and
gradually
soothed
her
into
a
state
of
deliberate
ire
during
which
she
determined
to
take
ample
vengeance
on
the
delinquent
in
the
zenith
of
her
rage
she
would
have
had
immediate
recourse
to
poison
or
steel
had
she
not
been
diverted
from
her
mortal
purpose
by
her
counsellor
who
represented
the
danger
of
engaging
in
such
violent
measures
and
proposed
a
more
secure
scheme
in
the
execution
of
which
she
would
see
the
perfidious
wretch
sufficiently
punished
without
any
hazard
to
her
own
person
or
reputation
she
advised
her
to
inform
the
jeweller
of
fathom
efforts
to
seduce
her
conjugal
fidelity
and
impart
to
him
a
plan
by
which
he
would
have
it
in
his
power
to
detect
our
adventurer
in
the
very
act
of
practising
upon
her
virtue
the
lady
relished
her
proposal
and
actually
resolved
to
make
an
assignation
with
ferdinand
as
usual
and
give
notice
of
the
appointment
to
her
husband
that
he
might
personally
discover
the
treachery
of
his
pretended
friend
and
inflict
upon
him
such
chastisement
as
the
brutal
disposition
should
suggest
when
inflamed
by
that
species
of
provocation
had
this
project
been
brought
to
bear
ferdinand
in
all
likelihood
would
have
been
disqualified
from
engaging
in
any
future
intrigue
but
fate
ordained
that
the
design
should
be
defeated
in
order
to
reserve
him
for
more
important
occasions
before
the
circumstances
of
the
plan
could
be
adjusted
it
was
his
good
fortune
to
meet
his
dulcinea
in
the
street
and
in
the
midst
of
their
mutual
condolence
on
the
interruption
they
had
suffered
in
their
correspondence
he
assured
her
that
he
would
never
give
his
invention
respite
until
he
should
have
verified
the
protestations
contained
in
the
letter
he
had
delivered
to
her
discreet
agent
this
allusion
to
a
billet
she
had
never
received
did
not
fail
to
alarm
her
fears
and
introduce
a
very
mortifying
explanation
in
which
he
so
accurately
described
the
person
of
the
messenger
that
she
forthwith
comprehended
the
plot
and
communicated
to
our
hero
her
sentiments
on
that
subject
though
he
expressed
infinite
anxiety
and
chagrin
at
this
misfortune
which
could
not
fail
to
raise
new
obstacles
to
their
love
his
heart
was
a
stranger
to
the
uneasiness
he
affected
and
rather
pleased
with
the
occasion
which
would
furnish
him
with
pretences
to
withdraw
himself
gradually
from
an
intercourse
by
this
time
become
equally
cloying
and
unprofitable
being
well
acquainted
with
the
mother
temperament
he
guessed
the
present
situation
of
her
thoughts
and
concluding
she
would
make
the
jeweller
a
party
in
her
revenge
he
resolved
from
that
moment
to
discontinue
his
visits
and
cautiously
guard
against
any
future
interview
with
the
lady
whom
he
had
rendered
so
implacable
it
was
well
for
our
adventurer
that
his
good
fortune
so
seasonably
interposed
for
that
same
day
in
the
afternoon
he
was
favoured
with
a
billet
from
the
jeweller
wife
couched
in
the
same
tender
style
she
had
formerly
used
and
importing
an
earnest
desire
of
seeing
him
next
day
at
the
wonted
rendezvous
although
his
penetration
was
sufficient
to
perceive
the
drift
of
this
message
or
at
least
to
discern
the
risk
he
should
run
in
complying
with
her
request
yet
he
was
willing
to
be
more
fully
certified
of
the
truth
of
his
suspicion
and
wrote
an
answer
to
the
billet
in
which
he
assured
her
that
he
would
repair
to
the
place
of
appointment
with
all
the
punctuality
of
an
impatient
lover
nevertheless
instead
of
performing
this
promise
he
in
the
morning
took
post
in
a
opposite
to
the
place
of
assignation
in
order
to
reconnoitre
the
ground
and
about
noon
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
german
wrapped
in
a
cloak
enter
the
door
of
his
though
the
appointment
was
fixed
at
five
in
the
evening
fathom
blessed
his
good
angel
for
having
conducted
him
clear
of
this
conspiracy
and
kept
his
station
with
great
tranquillity
till
the
hour
of
meeting
when
he
beheld
his
enraged
thalestris
take
the
same
route
and
enjoyed
her
disappointment
with
ineffable
satisfaction
thus
favoured
with
a
pretext
he
took
his
leave
of
her
in
a
letter
giving
her
to
understand
that
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
barbarous
snare
she
had
laid
for
him
and
upbraiding
her
with
having
made
such
an
ungrateful
return
for
all
his
tenderness
and
attachment
she
was
not
backward
in
conveying
a
reply
to
this
expostulation
which
seemed
to
have
been
dictated
in
all
the
distraction
of
a
proud
woman
who
sees
her
vengeance
baffled
as
well
as
her
love
disdained
her
letter
was
nothing
but
a
succession
of
reproaches
menaces
and
incoherent
execrations
she
taxed
him
with
knavery
insensibility
and
dissimulation
imprecated
a
thousand
curses
upon
his
head
and
threatened
not
only
to
persecute
his
life
with
all
the
arts
that
hell
and
malice
could
inspire
but
also
to
wound
him
in
the
person
of
her
who
should
be
enclosed
for
life
in
a
convent
where
she
should
have
leisure
to
repent
of
those
loose
and
disorderly
practices
which
he
had
taught
her
to
commit
and
of
which
she
could
not
pretend
innocence
as
they
had
it
in
their
power
to
confront
her
with
the
evidence
of
her
lover
own
confession
yet
all
this
denunciation
was
qualified
with
an
alternative
by
which
he
was
given
to
understand
that
the
gates
of
mercy
were
still
open
and
that
penitence
was
capable
of
washing
out
the
deepest
stain
of
guilt
ferdinand
read
the
whole
remonstrance
with
great
composure
and
moderation
and
was
content
to
incur
the
hazard
of
her
hate
rather
than
put
her
to
the
trouble
of
making
such
an
effort
of
generosity
as
would
induce
her
to
forgive
the
heinous
offence
he
had
committed
nor
did
his
apprehension
for
wilhelmina
in
the
least
influence
his
behaviour
on
this
occasion
so
zealous
was
he
for
her
spiritual
concerns
that
he
would
have
been
glad
to
hear
she
had
actually
taken
the
veil
but
he
knew
such
a
step
was
not
at
all
agreeable
to
her
disposition
and
that
no
violence
would
be
offered
to
her
inclinations
on
that
score
unless
her
stepmother
should
communicate
to
the
father
that
letter
of
fathom
which
she
had
intercepted
and
by
which
the
german
would
be
convinced
of
his
backsliding
but
this
measure
he
rightly
supposed
the
wife
would
not
venture
to
take
lest
the
husband
instead
of
taking
her
advice
touching
the
young
lady
should
seek
to
compromise
the
affair
by
offering
her
in
marriage
to
her
debaucher
a
proffer
which
if
accepted
would
overwhelm
the
mother
with
vexation
and
despair
he
therefore
chose
to
trust
to
the
effects
of
lenient
time
which
he
hoped
would
gradually
weaken
the
resentment
of
this
penthesilea
and
dissolve
his
connexion
with
the
other
parts
of
the
family
from
which
he
longed
to
be
totally
detached
how
well
soever
he
might
have
succeeded
in
his
attempts
to
shake
off
the
yoke
of
the
mother
who
by
her
situation
in
life
was
restrained
from
prosecuting
those
measures
her
resentment
had
planned
against
his
fortitude
and
indifference
he
would
have
found
greater
difficulty
than
he
had
foreseen
in
disengaging
himself
from
the
daughter
whose
affections
he
had
won
under
the
most
solemn
professions
of
honour
and
fidelity
and
who
now
she
was
debarred
of
his
company
and
conversation
and
in
danger
of
losing
him
for
ever
had
actually
taken
the
resolution
of
disclosing
the
amour
to
her
father
that
he
might
interpose
in
behalf
of
her
peace
and
reputation
and
secure
her
happiness
by
the
sanction
of
the
church
chapter
eighteen
our
hero
departs
from
vienna
and
quits
the
domain
of
venus
for
the
rough
field
of
mars
luckily
for
our
adventurer
before
she
adhered
to
this
determination
the
young
count
de
melvil
was
summoned
to
presburg
by
his
father
who
desired
to
see
him
before
he
should
take
the
field
in
consequence
of
a
rupture
between
the
emperor
and
the
french
king
and
fathom
of
course
quitted
vienna
in
order
to
attend
his
patron
after
he
and
renaldo
had
resided
two
whole
years
in
that
capital
where
the
former
had
made
himself
perfect
in
all
the
polite
exercises
become
master
of
the
french
tongue
and
learned
to
speak
the
italian
with
great
facility
over
and
above
those
other
accomplishments
in
which
we
have
represented
him
as
an
inimitable
original
as
for
the
young
count
his
exteriors
were
so
much
improved
by
the
company
to
which
he
had
access
since
his
departure
from
his
house
that
his
parents
were
equally
surprised
and
overjoyed
at
the
alteration
all
that
awkwardness
and
rusticity
which
hung
upon
his
deportment
was
like
the
rough
coat
of
a
diamond
polished
away
the
connexion
and
disposition
of
his
limbs
seemed
to
have
been
adjusted
anew
his
carriage
was
become
easy
his
air
perfectly
genteel
and
his
conversation
gay
and
unrestrained
the
merit
of
this
reformation
was
in
a
great
measure
ascribed
to
the
care
and
example
of
fathom
who
was
received
by
the
old
count
and
his
lady
with
marks
of
singular
friendship
and
esteem
nor
was
he
overlooked
by
mademoiselle
who
still
remained
in
a
state
of
celibacy
and
seemed
to
have
resigned
all
hope
of
altering
her
condition
she
expressed
uncommon
satisfaction
at
the
return
of
her
old
favourite
and
readmitted
him
into
the
same
degree
of
familiarity
with
which
he
had
been
honoured
before
his
departure
the
joy
of
teresa
was
so
excessive
at
his
arrival
that
she
could
scarce
suppress
her
raptures
so
as
to
conceal
them
from
the
notice
of
the
family
and
our
hero
upon
this
occasion
performed
the
part
of
an
exquisite
actor
in
dissembling
those
transports
which
his
bosom
never
knew
so
well
had
this
pupil
retained
the
lessons
of
her
instructor
that
in
the
midst
of
those
fraudulent
appropriations
which
she
still
continued
to
make
she
had
found
means
to
support
her
interest
and
character
with
mademoiselle
and
even
to
acquire
such
influence
in
the
family
that
no
other
servant
male
or
female
could
pretend
to
live
under
the
same
roof
without
paying
incessant
homage
to
this
artful
and
yielding
the
most
abject
submission
to
her
will
the
young
gentlemen
having
tarried
at
presburg
about
six
weeks
during
which
a
small
field
equipage
was
prepared
for
renaldo
they
repaired
to
the
camp
at
heilbron
under
the
auspices
of
count
melvil
in
whose
regiment
they
carried
arms
as
volunteers
with
a
view
to
merit
promotion
in
the
service
by
their
own
personal
behaviour
our
adventurer
would
have
willingly
dispensed
with
this
occasion
of
signalising
himself
his
talents
being
much
better
adapted
to
another
sphere
of
life
nevertheless
he
affected
uncommon
alacrity
at
the
prospect
of
gathering
laurels
in
the
field
and
subscribed
to
his
fortune
with
a
good
grace
foreseeing
that
even
in
a
campaign
a
man
of
his
art
and
ingenuity
might
find
means
to
consult
his
corporal
safety
without
any
danger
to
his
reputation
accordingly
before
he
had
lived
full
three
weeks
in
camp
the
damp
situation
and
sudden
change
in
his
way
of
life
had
such
a
violent
effect
upon
his
constitution
that
he
was
deprived
of
the
use
of
all
his
limbs
and
mourned
without
ceasing
his
hard
fate
by
which
he
found
himself
precluded
from
all
opportunity
of
exerting
his
diligence
courage
and
activity
in
the
character
of
a
soldier
to
which
he
now
aspired
renaldo
who
was
actually
enamoured
of
a
martial
life
and
missed
no
occasion
of
distinguishing
himself
consoled
his
companion
with
great
cordiality
encouraged
him
with
the
hope
of
seeing
his
constitution
familiarised
to
the
inconveniences
of
a
camp
and
accommodated
him
with
everything
which
he
thought
would
alleviate
the
pain
of
his
body
as
well
as
the
anxiety
of
his
mind
the
old
count
who
sincerely
sympathised
with
his
affliction
would
have
persuaded
him
to
retire
into
quarters
where
he
could
be
carefully
nursed
and
provided
with
everything
necessary
to
a
person
in
his
condition
but
such
was
his
desire
of
glory
that
he
resisted
his
patron
importunities
with
great
constancy
till
at
length
seeing
the
old
gentleman
obstinately
determined
to
consult
his
health
by
removing
him
from
the
field
he
gradually
suffered
himself
to
recover
the
use
of
his
hands
made
shift
to
sit
up
in
his
bed
and
amuse
himself
with
cards
or
backgammon
and
notwithstanding
the
feeble
condition
of
his
legs
ventured
to
ride
out
on
horseback
to
visit
the
lines
though
the
count
and
his
son
would
never
yield
to
his
solicitations
so
far
as
to
let
him
accompany
renaldo
in
those
excursions
and
reconnoitring
parties
by
which
a
volunteer
inures
himself
to
toil
and
peril
and
acquires
that
knowledge
in
the
operations
of
war
which
qualifies
him
for
a
command
in
the
service
notwithstanding
this
exemption
from
all
duty
our
adventurer
managed
matters
so
as
to
pass
for
a
youth
of
infinite
mettle
and
even
rendered
his
backwardness
and
timidity
subservient
to
the
support
of
that
character
by
expressing
an
impatience
of
lying
inactive
and
a
desire
of
signalising
his
prowess
which
even
the
disabled
condition
of
his
body
could
scarce
restrain
he
must
be
a
man
of
very
weak
nerves
and
excessive
irresolution
who
can
live
in
the
midst
of
actual
service
without
imbibing
some
portion
of
military
fortitude
danger
becomes
habitual
and
loses
a
great
part
of
its
terror
and
as
fear
is
often
caught
by
contagion
so
is
courage
communicated
among
the
individuals
of
an
army
the
hope
of
fame
desire
of
honours
and
preferment
envy
emulation
and
the
dread
of
disgrace
are
motives
which
in
suppressing
that
aversion
to
death
or
mutilation
which
nature
hath
implanted
in
the
human
mind
and
therefore
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
fathom
who
was
naturally
gained
some
advantages
over
his
disposition
before
the
end
of
the
campaign
which
happened
to
be
neither
perilous
nor
severe
during
the
winter
while
both
armies
remained
in
quarters
our
adventurer
attended
his
patron
to
presburg
and
before
the
troops
were
in
motion
renaldo
obtained
a
commission
in
consequence
of
which
he
went
into
garrison
at
philipsburg
whither
he
was
followed
by
our
hero
while
the
old
count
duty
called
him
to
the
field
in
a
different
place
ferdinand
for
some
time
had
no
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
this
disposition
by
which
he
was
at
once
delivered
from
the
fatigues
of
a
campaign
and
the
inspection
of
a
severe
censor
in
the
person
of
count
melvil
and
his
satisfaction
was
still
increased
by
an
accidental
meeting
with
the
tyrolese
who
had
been
his
confederate
at
vienna
and
now
chanced
to
serve
in
garrison
on
the
same
footing
with
himself
these
two
renewed
their
former
correspondence
and
as
all
soldiers
are
addicted
to
gaming
levied
contributions
upon
all
those
officers
who
had
money
to
lose
and
temerity
to
play
however
they
had
not
long
pursued
this
branch
of
traffic
when
their
success
was
interrupted
by
a
very
serious
occurrence
that
for
the
present
entirely
detached
the
gentlemen
in
the
garrison
from
such
amusements
the
french
troops
invested
fort
kehl
situated
on
the
rhine
opposite
to
strasburg
and
the
imperialists
dreading
that
the
next
storm
would
fall
upon
philipsburg
employed
themselves
with
great
diligence
to
put
that
important
fortress
in
a
proper
posture
of
defence
if
the
suspension
of
play
was
displeasing
to
our
hero
the
expectation
of
being
besieged
was
by
no
means
more
agreeable
he
knew
the
excellence
of
the
french
engineers
the
power
of
their
artillery
and
the
perseverance
of
their
general
he
felt
by
anticipation
the
toils
of
hard
duty
upon
the
works
the
horrors
of
cannonading
bombardment
sallies
and
mines
blown
up
and
deliberated
with
himself
whether
or
not
he
should
privately
withdraw
and
take
refuge
among
the
besiegers
but
when
he
reflected
that
such
a
step
besides
the
infamy
that
must
attend
it
would
be
like
that
of
running
upon
scylla
seeking
to
avoid
charybdis
as
he
would
be
exposed
to
more
danger
and
inconvenience
in
the
trenches
than
he
could
possibly
undergo
in
the
town
and
after
all
run
the
risk
of
being
taken
and
treated
as
a
deserter
upon
these
considerations
he
resolved
to
submit
himself
to
his
destiny
and
endeavoured
to
mitigate
the
rigour
of
his
fate
by
those
arts
he
had
formerly
practised
with
success
he
accordingly
found
means
to
enjoy
a
very
bad
state
of
health
during
the
whole
siege
which
lasted
about
six
weeks
after
the
trenches
were
opened
and
then
the
garrison
marched
out
by
capitulation
with
all
the
honours
of
war
chapter
nineteen
he
puts
himself
under
the
guidance
of
his
associate
and
stumbles
upon
the
french
camp
where
he
finishes
his
military
career
nothing
else
of
moment
was
transacted
during
that
campaign
and
in
the
winter
our
adventurer
with
the
young
count
and
his
friend
the
tyrolese
were
disposed
in
quarters
of
cantonment
where
ferdinand
made
himself
amends
for
the
chagrin
he
had
undergone
by
the
exercise
of
those
talents
in
which
he
excelled
not
that
he
was
satisfied
with
the
sphere
of
life
in
which
he
acted
though
he
knew
himself
consummate
in
the
art
of
play
he
was
not
at
all
ambitious
of
a
gamester
name
nor
did
he
find
himself
disposed
to
hazard
those
discoveries
and
explanations
to
which
heroes
of
that
class
are
sometimes
necessarily
exposed
his
aim
was
to
dwell
among
the
tents
of
civil
life
undisturbed
by
quarrels
and
the
din
of
war
and
render
mankind
subservient
to
his
interest
not
by
stratagems
which
irritate
but
by
that
suppleness
of
insinuation
which
could
not
fail
to
soothe
the
temper
of
those
on
whom
he
meant
to
prey
he
saw
that
all
his
expectations
of
count
melvil
future
favour
were
connected
with
his
choice
of
a
military
life
and
that
his
promotion
in
the
service
would
in
a
great
measure
depend
upon
his
personal
behaviour
in
such
emergencies
as
he
did
not
at
all
wish
to
encounter
on
the
other
hand
he
confided
so
much
in
his
own
dexterity
and
address
that
he
never
doubted
of
being
able
to
rear
a
splendid
fortune
for
himself
provided
he
could
once
obtain
a
fixed
and
firm
foundation
he
had
in
fancy
often
enjoyed
a
prospect
of
england
not
only
as
his
native
country
to
which
like
a
true
citizen
he
longed
to
be
united
but
also
as
the
land
of
promise
flowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
abounding
with
subjects
on
which
he
knew
his
talents
would
be
properly
exercised
these
reflections
never
occurred
without
leaving
a
strong
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
which
influenced
his
deliberations
in
such
a
manner
as
at
length
amounted
to
a
perfect
resolution
of
withdrawing
himself
privately
from
a
service
that
teemed
with
disagreeable
events
and
of
transporting
himself
into
the
country
of
his
ancestors
which
he
considered
as
the
canaan
of
all
able
adventurers
but
previous
to
his
appearance
on
that
stage
he
was
desirous
of
visiting
the
metropolis
of
france
in
which
he
hoped
to
improve
himself
in
the
knowledge
of
men
and
things
and
acquire
such
intelligence
as
would
qualify
him
to
act
a
more
important
part
upon
the
british
scene
after
having
for
some
time
indulged
these
prospects
in
secret
he
determined
to
accommodate
himself
with
the
company
and
experience
of
the
tyrolese
whom
under
the
specious
title
of
an
associate
he
knew
he
could
convert
into
a
very
serviceable
tool
in
forwarding
the
execution
of
his
own
projects
accordingly
the
inclination
of
this
confederate
was
sounded
by
distant
hints
and
being
found
apt
our
hero
made
him
privy
to
his
design
of
decamping
without
beat
of
drum
though
at
the
same
time
he
begged
his
advice
touching
the
method
of
their
departure
that
he
might
retire
with
as
much
delicacy
as
the
nature
of
such
a
step
would
permit
divers
consultations
were
held
upon
this
subject
before
they
adhered
to
the
resolution
of
making
their
escape
from
the
army
after
it
should
have
taken
the
field
in
the
spring
because
in
that
case
they
would
have
frequent
opportunities
of
going
abroad
on
foraging
parties
and
during
one
of
these
excursions
might
retire
in
such
a
manner
as
to
persuade
their
companions
that
they
had
fallen
into
the
enemy
hands
agreeable
to
this
determination
the
camp
was
no
sooner
formed
in
alsace
than
our
associates
began
to
make
preparations
for
their
march
and
had
already
taken
all
the
previous
measures
for
their
departure
when
an
accident
happened
which
our
hero
did
not
fail
to
convert
to
his
own
advantage
this
was
no
other
than
the
desertion
of
renaldo
valet
who
in
consequence
of
a
gentle
chastisement
which
he
had
richly
merited
thought
proper
to
disappear
after
having
plundered
his
portmanteau
which
he
had
forced
open
for
the
purpose
ferdinand
who
was
the
first
person
that
discovered
the
theft
immediately
comprehended
the
whole
adventure
and
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
delinquent
would
never
return
resolved
to
finish
what
the
fugitive
had
imperfectly
performed
being
favoured
with
the
unreserved
confidence
of
the
young
count
he
instantly
had
recourse
to
his
bureau
the
locks
of
which
he
found
means
to
burst
open
and
examining
a
private
drawer
contrived
with
great
art
to
conceal
renaldo
jewels
and
cash
made
himself
master
of
the
contents
without
hesitation
then
cutting
open
his
and
strewing
the
tent
with
his
linen
and
clothes
began
to
raise
his
voice
and
produce
such
a
clamour
as
alarmed
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
brought
a
great
many
officers
into
the
tent
he
on
this
as
on
all
other
occasions
performed
his
cue
to
a
miracle
expressing
confusion
and
concern
so
naturally
in
his
gestures
and
exclamation
that
no
man
could
possibly
suspect
his
sincerity
nay
to
such
a
degree
of
finesse
did
his
cunning
amount
that
when
his
friend
and
patron
entered
in
consequence
of
an
intimation
he
soon
received
of
his
loss
our
adventurer
exhibited
undoubted
signs
of
distraction
and
delirium
and
springing
upon
renaldo
with
all
the
frantic
fury
of
a
bedlamite
villain
cried
he
restore
the
effects
you
have
stole
from
your
master
or
you
shall
be
immediately
committed
to
the
care
of
the
prevot
however
mortified
de
melvil
might
be
at
his
own
misfortune
the
condition
of
his
friend
seemed
to
touch
him
more
nearly
he
undervalued
his
own
loss
as
a
trifle
that
could
be
easily
repaired
said
everything
which
he
thought
would
tend
to
soothe
and
compose
the
agitation
of
ferdinand
and
finally
prevailed
upon
him
to
retire
to
rest
the
calamity
was
wholly
attributed
to
the
deserter
and
renaldo
far
from
suspecting
the
true
author
took
occasion
from
his
behaviour
on
this
emergency
to
admire
him
as
a
mirror
of
integrity
and
attachment
in
such
an
exquisite
manner
did
he
plan
all
his
designs
that
almost
every
instance
of
his
fraud
furnished
matter
of
triumph
to
his
reputation
having
thus
profitably
exercised
his
genius
this
subtle
politician
thought
it
high
time
to
relinquish
his
military
expectations
and
securing
all
his
valuable
acquisitions
about
his
own
person
rode
out
with
his
understrapper
in
the
midst
of
fifty
dragoons
who
went
in
quest
of
forage
while
the
troopers
were
employed
in
making
up
their
trusses
the
two
adventurers
advanced
towards
the
skirt
of
a
wood
on
pretence
of
reconnoitring
and
the
tyrolese
who
undertook
to
be
our
hero
guide
directing
him
to
a
path
which
leads
towards
strasburg
they
suddenly
vanished
from
the
eyes
of
their
companions
who
in
a
few
minutes
hearing
the
report
of
several
pistols
which
the
confederates
purposely
fired
conjectured
that
they
had
fallen
in
with
a
party
of
french
by
whom
they
were
made
prisoners
of
war
the
tyrolese
had
overrated
his
own
knowledge
when
he
took
upon
himself
the
charge
of
conducting
our
hero
for
upon
their
arrival
at
a
certain
place
where
two
roads
crossed
each
other
he
chanced
to
follow
that
which
not
only
frustrated
their
intention
but
even
led
them
directly
to
the
french
camp
so
that
in
the
twilight
they
fell
in
upon
one
of
the
outguards
before
they
were
aware
of
their
mistake
whatever
confusion
and
perplexity
they
might
undergo
when
they
heard
themselves
questioned
by
the
sentinel
on
the
advanced
post
certain
it
is
they
betrayed
no
symptoms
of
fear
or
disorder
but
while
ferdinand
endeavoured
to
recollect
himself
his
with
the
appearance
of
admirable
intrepidity
and
presence
of
mind
told
the
soldier
that
he
and
his
companion
were
two
gentlemen
of
family
who
had
quitted
the
austrian
army
on
account
of
having
sustained
some
which
they
had
no
opportunity
of
resenting
in
any
other
way
and
that
they
were
come
to
offer
their
services
to
the
french
general
to
whose
quarters
they
desired
to
be
immediately
conveyed
the
sentinel
to
whom
such
an
instance
of
desertion
was
neither
rare
nor
indeed
uncommon
directed
them
without
scruple
to
the
next
post
where
they
found
a
serjeant
party
from
which
at
their
request
they
were
transmitted
to
the
officer
of
the
grand
guard
and
by
him
next
morning
introduced
to
count
coigny
who
very
politely
received
them
as
volunteers
in
the
army
of
france
though
this
translation
was
not
at
all
to
our
hero
liking
he
was
forced
to
acquiesce
in
his
fate
glad
to
find
himself
on
these
terms
in
possession
of
his
effects
of
which
he
would
otherwise
have
been
infallibly
rifled
this
campaign
however
was
the
most
disagreeable
period
of
his
whole
life
because
the
manner
in
which
he
had
entered
into
the
service
subjected
him
to
the
particular
observation
and
notice
of
the
french
officers
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
be
very
alert
in
his
duty
and
summon
all
his
fortitude
to
maintain
the
character
he
had
assumed
what
rendered
his
situation
still
more
unpalatable
was
the
activity
of
both
armies
in
the
course
of
this
season
during
which
over
and
above
sundry
fatiguing
marches
and
countermarches
he
was
personally
engaged
in
the
affair
of
halleh
which
was
very
obstinate
where
being
in
the
skirts
of
the
detachment
he
was
actually
wounded
in
the
face
by
the
sword
of
an
hussar
but
this
was
luckily
for
him
the
last
time
he
found
himself
under
the
necessity
of
exerting
his
military
prowess
for
a
cessation
of
arms
was
proclaimed
before
he
was
cured
of
his
wound
and
peace
concluded
about
the
end
of
the
campaign
during
his
sojourn
in
the
french
camp
he
assumed
the
character
of
a
man
of
family
who
being
disgusted
at
some
supercilious
treatment
he
had
met
with
in
the
german
service
and
at
the
same
time
ambitious
of
carrying
arms
under
the
banners
of
france
took
the
opportunity
of
retreating
by
stealth
from
his
friends
accompanied
only
by
one
with
whom
he
could
intrust
his
intention
in
this
capacity
he
had
managed
his
matters
to
such
advantage
that
many
french
officers
of
rank
were
very
well
disposed
to
contribute
their
interest
in
his
behalf
had
his
inclination
verged
towards
promotion
in
the
army
but
he
thought
proper
to
conceal
his
real
design
under
the
specious
pretext
of
longing
to
see
the
metropolis
of
france
that
centre
of
pleasure
and
politeness
in
which
he
proposed
to
spend
some
time
for
the
improvement
of
his
address
and
understanding
these
were
motives
too
laudable
to
be
opposed
by
his
new
patrons
some
of
whom
furnished
him
with
letters
of
recommendation
to
certain
noblemen
of
the
first
rank
at
the
court
of
versailles
for
which
place
he
and
his
companion
set
out
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
very
well
satisfied
with
the
honourable
dismission
they
had
obtained
from
a
life
of
inconvenience
danger
and
alarm
chapter
twenty
he
prepares
a
stratagem
but
finds
himself
countermined
proceeds
on
his
journey
and
is
overtaken
by
a
terrible
tempest
in
the
course
of
this
journey
ferdinand
who
was
never
deficient
in
his
political
capacity
held
a
secret
conclave
with
his
own
thoughts
not
only
touching
the
plan
of
his
own
future
conduct
but
also
concerning
his
associate
of
whose
fidelity
and
adherence
he
began
to
entertain
such
doubts
as
discouraged
him
from
the
prosecution
of
that
design
in
which
the
tyrolese
had
been
at
first
included
for
he
had
lately
observed
him
practise
the
arts
of
his
occupation
among
the
french
officers
with
such
rapacity
and
want
of
caution
as
indicated
a
dangerous
temerity
of
temper
as
well
as
a
furious
rage
of
acquiring
which
might
be
some
time
or
other
satiated
upon
his
own
friends
in
other
words
our
adventurer
was
afraid
that
his
accomplice
would
profit
by
his
knowledge
of
the
road
and
countries
through
which
they
travelled
and
after
having
made
free
with
his
most
valuable
effects
in
consequence
of
the
familiarity
subsisting
between
them
leave
him
some
morning
without
the
ceremony
of
a
formal
adieu
aroused
by
this
suspicion
he
resolved
to
anticipate
the
supposed
intention
of
the
tyrolese
by
taking
his
own
departure
in
the
same
abrupt
manner
and
this
scheme
he
actually
put
in
execution
upon
their
arrival
in
where
it
was
agreed
they
should
spend
a
day
to
repose
and
refresh
themselves
from
the
fatigue
of
hard
riding
ferdinand
therefore
taking
the
advantage
of
his
companion
absence
for
the
tyrolese
had
walked
abroad
to
view
the
town
found
means
to
hire
a
peasant
who
undertook
to
conduct
him
through
a
as
far
as
chalons
and
with
his
guide
he
accordingly
set
out
on
horseback
after
having
discharged
the
bill
left
a
blank
paper
sealed
up
in
form
of
a
letter
directed
to
his
friend
and
secured
behind
his
own
saddle
a
pair
of
leathern
bags
in
which
his
jewels
and
cash
were
usually
contained
so
eager
was
our
hero
to
leave
the
tyrolese
at
a
considerable
distance
behind
that
he
rode
all
night
at
a
round
pace
without
halting
and
next
morning
found
himself
at
a
village
distant
thirteen
good
leagues
from
any
part
of
the
route
which
he
and
his
companion
had
at
first
resolved
to
pursue
here
thinking
himself
safely
delivered
from
the
cause
of
all
his
apprehension
he
determined
to
lie
incognito
for
a
few
days
so
as
that
he
might
run
no
risk
of
an
accidental
meeting
upon
the
road
with
the
person
whose
company
he
had
forsaken
and
accordingly
took
possession
of
an
apartment
in
which
he
went
to
rest
desiring
his
guide
to
wake
him
when
dinner
should
be
ready
having
enjoyed
a
very
comfortable
refreshment
of
sleep
with
his
bags
under
his
pillow
he
was
summoned
according
to
his
direction
and
ate
a
very
hearty
meal
with
great
tranquillity
and
internal
satisfaction
in
the
afternoon
he
amused
himself
with
happy
presages
and
ideal
prospects
of
his
future
fortune
and
in
the
midst
of
these
imaginary
banquets
was
seized
with
an
inclination
of
realising
his
bliss
and
regaling
his
eyesight
with
the
fruits
of
that
success
which
had
hitherto
attended
his
endeavours
thus
inflamed
he
opened
the
repository
and
o
reader
what
were
his
reflections
when
in
lieu
of
mademoiselle
melvil
and
necklace
the
german
golden
chain
divers
jewels
of
considerable
value
the
spoils
of
sundry
dupes
and
about
two
hundred
ducats
in
ready
money
he
found
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
parcel
of
rusty
nails
disposed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
resemble
in
weight
and
bulk
the
moveables
he
had
lost
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
our
adventurer
made
this
discovery
without
emotion
if
the
eternal
salvation
of
mankind
could
have
been
purchased
for
the
tenth
part
of
his
treasure
he
would
have
left
the
whole
species
in
a
state
of
reprobation
rather
than
redeem
them
at
that
price
unless
he
had
seen
in
the
bargain
some
evident
advantage
to
his
own
concerns
one
may
therefore
easily
conceive
with
what
milkiness
of
resignation
he
bore
the
loss
of
the
whole
and
saw
himself
reduced
from
such
affluence
to
the
necessity
of
depending
upon
about
twenty
ducats
and
some
loose
silver
which
he
carried
in
his
pocket
for
his
expense
upon
the
road
however
bitter
this
pill
might
be
in
swallowing
he
so
far
mastered
his
mortification
as
to
digest
it
with
a
good
grace
his
own
penetration
at
once
pointed
out
the
canal
through
which
this
misfortune
had
flowed
upon
him
he
forthwith
placed
the
calamity
to
the
account
of
the
tyrolese
and
never
doubting
that
he
had
retired
with
the
booty
across
the
rhine
into
some
place
to
which
he
knew
fathom
would
not
follow
his
footsteps
he
formed
the
melancholy
resolution
of
pursuing
with
all
despatch
his
journey
to
paris
that
he
might
with
all
convenient
expedition
indemnify
himself
for
the
discomfiture
he
had
sustained
with
regard
to
his
confederate
his
conjecture
was
perfectly
right
that
adventurer
though
infinitely
inferior
to
our
hero
in
point
of
genius
and
invention
had
manifestly
the
advantage
of
him
in
the
articles
of
age
and
experience
he
was
no
stranger
to
fathom
qualifications
the
happy
exertion
of
which
he
had
often
seen
he
knew
him
to
be
an
economist
of
the
most
frugal
order
consequently
concluded
his
finances
were
worthy
of
examination
and
upon
the
true
principles
of
a
sharper
eased
him
of
the
encumbrance
taking
it
for
granted
that
in
so
doing
he
only
precluded
ferdinand
from
the
power
of
acting
the
same
tragedy
upon
him
should
ever
opportunity
concur
with
his
inclination
he
had
therefore
concerted
his
measures
with
the
dexterity
of
an
experienced
conveyancer
and
snatching
the
occasion
while
our
hero
lay
sunk
in
the
arms
of
profound
repose
he
ripped
up
the
seams
of
the
leather
depository
withdrew
the
contents
introduced
the
parcel
of
nails
which
he
had
made
up
for
the
purpose
and
then
repaired
the
breach
with
great
deliberation
had
fathom
good
genius
prompted
him
to
examine
his
effects
next
morning
the
tyrolese
in
all
probability
would
have
maintained
his
acquisition
by
force
of
arms
for
his
personal
courage
was
rather
more
determined
than
that
of
our
adventurer
and
he
was
conscious
of
his
own
ascendency
in
this
particular
but
his
good
fortune
prevented
such
explanation
immediately
after
dinner
he
availed
himself
of
his
knowledge
and
betaking
himself
to
a
remote
part
of
the
town
set
out
in
a
for
luneville
while
our
hero
was
meditating
his
own
escape
fathom
conception
was
sufficient
to
comprehend
the
whole
of
this
adventure
as
soon
as
his
chagrin
would
give
his
sagacity
fair
play
nor
would
he
allow
his
resolution
to
sink
under
the
trial
on
the
contrary
he
departed
from
the
village
that
same
afternoon
under
the
auspices
of
his
conductor
and
found
himself
benighted
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
far
from
the
habitations
of
men
the
darkness
of
the
night
the
silence
and
solitude
of
the
place
the
indistinct
images
of
the
trees
that
appeared
on
every
side
stretching
their
extravagant
arms
athwart
the
gloom
conspired
with
the
dejection
of
spirits
occasioned
by
his
loss
to
disturb
his
fancy
and
raise
strange
phantoms
in
his
imagination
although
he
was
not
naturally
superstitious
his
mind
began
to
be
invaded
with
an
awful
horror
that
gradually
prevailed
over
all
the
consolations
of
reason
and
philosophy
nor
was
his
heart
free
from
the
terrors
of
assassination
in
order
to
dissipate
these
disagreeable
reveries
he
had
recourse
to
the
conversation
of
his
guide
by
whom
he
was
entertained
with
the
history
of
divers
travellers
who
had
been
robbed
and
murdered
by
ruffians
whose
retreat
was
in
the
recesses
of
that
very
wood
in
the
midst
of
this
communication
which
did
not
at
all
tend
to
the
elevation
of
our
hero
spirits
the
conductor
made
an
excuse
for
dropping
behind
while
our
traveller
jogged
on
in
expectation
of
being
joined
again
by
him
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
however
disappointed
in
that
hope
the
sound
of
the
other
horse
feet
by
degrees
grew
more
and
more
faint
and
at
last
altogether
died
away
alarmed
at
this
circumstance
fathom
halted
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
listened
with
the
most
fearful
attention
but
his
sense
of
hearing
was
saluted
with
nought
but
the
dismal
sighings
of
the
trees
that
seemed
to
foretell
an
approaching
storm
accordingly
the
heavens
contracted
a
more
dreary
aspect
the
lightning
began
to
gleam
and
the
thunder
to
roll
and
the
tempest
raising
its
voice
to
a
tremendous
roar
descended
in
a
torrent
of
rain
in
this
emergency
the
fortitude
of
our
hero
was
almost
quite
overcome
so
many
concurring
circumstances
of
danger
and
distress
might
have
appalled
the
most
undaunted
breast
what
impression
then
must
they
have
made
upon
the
mind
of
ferdinand
who
was
by
no
means
a
man
to
set
fear
at
defiance
indeed
he
had
lost
the
use
of
his
reflection
and
was
actually
invaded
to
the
skin
before
he
could
recollect
himself
so
far
as
to
quit
the
road
and
seek
for
shelter
among
the
thickets
that
surrounded
him
having
rode
some
furlongs
into
the
forest
he
took
his
station
under
a
tuft
of
tall
trees
that
screened
him
from
the
storm
and
in
that
situation
called
a
council
within
himself
to
deliberate
upon
his
next
excursion
he
persuaded
himself
that
his
guide
had
deserted
him
for
the
present
in
order
to
give
intelligence
of
a
traveller
to
some
gang
of
robbers
with
whom
he
was
connected
and
that
he
must
of
necessity
fall
a
prey
to
those
banditti
unless
he
should
have
the
good
fortune
to
elude
their
search
and
disentangle
himself
from
the
mazes
of
the
wood
harrowed
with
these
apprehensions
he
resolved
to
commit
himself
to
the
mercy
of
the
hurricane
as
of
two
evils
the
least
and
penetrate
straightforwards
through
some
devious
opening
until
he
should
be
delivered
from
the
forest
for
this
purpose
he
turned
his
horse
head
in
a
line
quite
contrary
to
the
direction
of
the
high
road
which
he
had
left
on
the
supposition
that
the
robbers
would
pursue
that
track
in
quest
of
him
and
that
they
would
never
dream
of
his
deserting
the
highway
to
traverse
an
unknown
forest
amidst
the
darkness
of
such
a
boisterous
night
after
he
had
continued
in
this
progress
through
a
succession
of
groves
and
bogs
and
thorns
and
brakes
by
which
not
only
his
clothes
but
also
his
skin
suffered
in
a
grievous
manner
while
every
nerve
quivered
with
eagerness
and
dismay
he
at
length
reached
an
open
plain
and
pursuing
his
course
in
full
hope
of
arriving
at
some
village
where
his
life
would
be
safe
he
descried
a
at
a
distance
which
he
looked
upon
as
the
star
of
his
good
fortune
and
riding
towards
it
at
full
speed
arrived
at
the
door
of
a
lone
cottage
into
which
he
was
admitted
by
an
old
woman
who
understanding
he
was
a
bewildered
traveller
received
him
with
great
hospitality
when
he
learned
from
his
hostess
that
there
was
not
another
house
within
three
leagues
that
she
could
accommodate
him
with
a
tolerable
bed
and
his
horse
with
lodging
and
oats
he
thanked
heaven
for
his
good
fortune
in
stumbling
upon
this
homely
habitation
and
determined
to
pass
the
night
under
the
protection
of
the
old
cottager
who
gave
him
to
understand
that
her
husband
who
was
a
had
gone
to
the
next
town
to
dispose
of
his
merchandise
and
that
in
all
probability
he
would
not
return
till
next
morning
on
account
of
the
tempestuous
night
ferdinand
sounded
the
beldame
with
a
thousand
artful
interrogations
and
she
answered
with
such
appearance
of
truth
and
simplicity
that
he
concluded
his
person
was
quite
secure
and
after
having
been
regaled
with
a
dish
of
eggs
and
bacon
desired
she
would
conduct
him
into
the
chamber
where
she
proposed
he
should
take
his
repose
he
was
accordingly
ushered
up
by
a
sort
of
ladder
into
an
apartment
furnished
with
a
and
almost
half
filled
with
trusses
of
straw
he
seemed
extremely
well
pleased
with
his
lodging
which
in
reality
exceeded
his
expectation
and
his
kind
landlady
cautioning
him
against
letting
the
candle
approach
the
combustibles
took
her
leave
and
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
chapter
he
falls
upon
scylla
seeking
to
avoid
charybdis
fathom
whose
own
principles
taught
him
to
be
suspicious
and
ever
upon
his
guard
against
the
treachery
of
his
could
have
dispensed
with
this
instance
of
her
care
in
confining
her
guest
to
her
chamber
and
began
to
be
seized
with
strange
fancies
when
he
observed
that
there
was
no
bolt
on
the
inside
of
the
door
by
which
he
might
secure
himself
from
intrusion
in
consequence
of
these
suggestions
he
proposed
to
take
an
accurate
survey
of
every
object
in
the
apartment
and
in
the
course
of
his
inquiry
had
the
mortification
to
find
the
dead
body
of
a
man
still
warm
who
had
been
lately
stabbed
and
concealed
beneath
several
bundles
of
straw
such
a
discovery
could
not
fail
to
fill
the
breast
of
our
hero
with
unspeakable
horror
for
he
concluded
that
he
himself
would
undergo
the
same
fate
before
morning
without
the
interposition
of
a
miracle
in
his
favour
in
the
first
transports
of
his
dread
he
ran
to
the
window
with
a
view
to
escape
by
that
outlet
and
found
his
flight
effectually
obstructed
by
divers
strong
bars
of
iron
then
his
heart
began
to
palpitate
his
hair
to
bristle
up
and
his
knees
to
totter
his
thoughts
teemed
with
presages
of
death
and
destruction
his
conscience
rose
up
in
judgment
against
him
and
he
underwent
a
severe
paroxysm
of
dismay
and
distraction
his
spirits
were
agitated
into
a
state
of
fermentation
that
produced
a
species
of
resolution
akin
to
that
which
is
inspired
by
brandy
or
other
strong
liquors
and
by
an
impulse
that
seemed
supernatural
he
was
immediately
hurried
into
measures
for
his
own
preservation
what
upon
a
less
interesting
occasion
his
imagination
durst
not
propose
he
now
executed
without
scruple
or
remorse
he
undressed
the
corpse
that
lay
bleeding
among
the
straw
and
conveying
it
to
the
bed
in
his
arms
deposited
it
in
the
attitude
of
a
person
who
sleeps
at
his
ease
then
he
extinguished
the
light
took
possession
of
the
place
from
whence
the
body
had
been
removed
and
holding
a
pistol
ready
cocked
in
each
hand
waited
for
the
sequel
with
that
determined
purpose
which
is
often
the
immediate
production
of
despair
about
midnight
he
heard
the
sound
of
feet
ascending
the
ladder
the
door
was
softly
opened
he
saw
the
shadow
of
two
men
stalking
towards
the
bed
a
dark
lanthorn
being
unshrouded
directed
their
aim
to
the
supposed
sleeper
and
he
that
held
it
thrust
a
poniard
to
his
heart
the
force
of
the
blow
made
a
compression
on
the
chest
and
a
sort
of
groan
issued
from
the
windpipe
of
the
defunct
the
stroke
was
repeated
without
producing
a
repetition
of
the
note
so
that
the
assassins
concluded
the
work
was
effectually
done
and
retired
for
the
present
with
a
design
to
return
and
rifle
the
deceased
at
their
leisure
never
had
our
hero
spent
a
moment
in
such
agony
as
he
felt
during
this
operation
the
whole
surface
of
his
body
was
covered
with
a
cold
sweat
and
his
nerves
were
relaxed
with
an
universal
palsy
in
short
he
remained
in
a
trance
that
in
all
probability
contributed
to
his
safety
for
had
he
retained
the
use
of
his
senses
he
might
have
been
discovered
by
the
transports
of
his
fear
the
first
use
he
made
of
his
retrieved
recollection
was
to
perceive
that
the
assassins
had
left
the
door
open
in
their
retreat
and
he
would
have
instantly
availed
himself
of
this
their
neglect
by
sallying
out
upon
them
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
had
he
not
been
restrained
by
a
conversation
he
overheard
in
the
room
below
importing
that
the
ruffians
were
going
to
set
out
upon
another
expedition
in
hopes
of
finding
more
prey
they
accordingly
departed
after
having
laid
strong
injunctions
upon
the
old
woman
to
keep
the
door
fast
locked
during
their
absence
and
ferdinand
took
his
resolution
without
farther
delay
so
soon
as
by
his
conjecture
the
robbers
were
at
a
sufficient
distance
from
the
house
he
rose
from
his
moved
softly
towards
the
bed
and
rummaging
the
pockets
of
the
deceased
found
a
purse
well
stored
with
ducats
of
which
together
with
a
silver
watch
and
a
diamond
ring
he
immediately
possessed
himself
without
scruple
then
descending
with
great
care
and
circumspection
into
the
lower
apartment
stood
before
the
old
beldame
before
she
had
the
least
intimation
of
his
approach
accustomed
as
she
was
to
the
trade
of
blood
the
hoary
hag
did
not
behold
this
apparition
without
giving
signs
of
infinite
terror
and
astonishment
believing
it
was
no
other
than
the
spirit
of
her
second
guest
who
had
been
murdered
she
fell
upon
her
knees
and
began
to
recommend
herself
to
the
protection
of
the
saints
crossing
herself
with
as
much
devotion
as
if
she
had
been
entitled
to
the
particular
care
and
attention
of
heaven
nor
did
her
anxiety
abate
when
she
was
undeceived
in
this
her
supposition
and
understood
it
was
no
phantom
but
the
real
substance
of
the
stranger
who
without
staying
to
upbraid
her
with
the
enormity
of
her
crimes
commanded
her
on
pain
of
immediate
death
to
produce
his
horse
to
which
being
conducted
he
set
her
upon
the
saddle
without
delay
and
mounting
behind
invested
her
with
the
management
of
the
reins
swearing
in
a
most
peremptory
tone
that
the
only
chance
she
had
for
her
life
was
in
directing
him
safely
to
the
next
town
and
that
so
soon
as
she
should
give
him
the
least
cause
to
doubt
her
fidelity
in
the
performance
of
that
task
he
would
on
the
instant
act
the
part
of
her
executioner
this
declaration
had
its
effect
upon
the
withered
hecate
who
with
many
supplications
for
mercy
and
forgiveness
promised
to
guide
him
in
safety
to
a
certain
village
at
the
distance
of
two
leagues
where
he
might
lodge
in
security
and
be
provided
with
a
fresh
horse
or
other
convenience
for
pursuing
his
intended
route
on
these
conditions
he
told
her
she
might
deserve
his
clemency
and
they
accordingly
took
their
departure
together
she
being
placed
astride
upon
the
saddle
holding
the
bridle
in
one
hand
and
a
switch
in
the
other
and
our
adventurer
sitting
on
the
crupper
superintending
her
conduct
and
keeping
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
close
at
her
ear
in
this
equipage
they
travelled
across
part
of
the
same
wood
in
which
his
guide
had
forsaken
him
and
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
passed
his
time
in
the
most
agreeable
reverie
while
he
found
himself
involved
in
the
labyrinth
of
those
shades
which
he
considered
as
the
haunts
of
robbery
and
assassination
common
fear
was
a
comfortable
sensation
to
what
he
felt
in
this
excursion
the
first
steps
he
had
taken
for
his
preservation
were
the
effects
of
mere
instinct
while
his
faculties
were
extinguished
or
suppressed
by
despair
but
now
as
his
reflection
began
to
recur
he
was
haunted
by
the
most
intolerable
apprehensions
every
whisper
of
the
wind
through
the
thickets
was
swelled
into
the
hoarse
menaces
of
murder
the
shaking
of
the
boughs
was
construed
into
the
brandishing
of
poniards
and
every
shadow
of
a
tree
became
the
apparition
of
a
ruffian
eager
for
blood
in
short
at
each
of
these
occurrences
he
felt
what
was
infinitely
more
tormenting
than
the
stab
of
a
real
dagger
and
at
every
fresh
fillip
of
his
fear
he
acted
as
a
remembrancer
to
his
conductress
in
a
new
volley
of
imprecations
importing
that
her
life
was
absolutely
connected
with
his
opinion
of
his
own
safety
human
nature
could
not
longer
subsist
under
such
complicated
terror
at
last
he
found
himself
clear
of
the
forest
and
was
blessed
with
the
distant
view
of
an
inhabited
place
he
then
began
to
exercise
his
thoughts
upon
a
new
subject
he
debated
with
himself
whether
he
should
make
a
parade
of
his
intrepidity
and
public
spirit
by
disclosing
his
achievement
and
surrendering
his
guide
to
the
penalty
of
the
law
or
leave
the
old
hag
and
her
accomplices
to
the
remorse
of
their
own
consciences
and
proceed
quietly
on
his
journey
to
paris
in
undisturbed
possession
of
the
prize
he
had
already
obtained
this
last
step
he
determined
to
take
upon
recollecting
that
in
the
course
of
his
information
the
story
of
the
murdered
stranger
would
infallibly
attract
the
attention
of
justice
and
in
that
case
the
effects
he
had
borrowed
from
the
defunct
must
be
refunded
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
had
a
right
to
the
succession
this
was
an
argument
which
our
adventurer
could
not
resist
he
foresaw
that
he
should
be
stripped
of
his
acquisition
which
he
looked
upon
as
the
fair
fruits
of
his
valour
and
sagacity
and
moreover
be
detained
as
an
evidence
against
the
robbers
to
the
manifest
detriment
of
his
affairs
perhaps
too
he
had
motives
of
conscience
that
dissuaded
him
from
bearing
witness
against
a
set
of
people
whose
principles
did
not
much
differ
from
his
own
influenced
by
such
considerations
he
yielded
to
the
first
importunity
of
the
beldame
whom
he
dismissed
at
a
very
small
distance
from
the
village
after
he
had
earnestly
exhorted
her
to
quit
such
an
atrocious
course
of
life
and
atone
for
her
past
crimes
by
sacrificing
her
associates
to
the
demands
of
justice
she
did
not
fail
to
vow
a
perfect
reformation
and
to
prostrate
herself
before
him
for
the
favour
she
had
found
then
she
betook
herself
to
her
habitation
with
full
purpose
of
advising
her
to
repair
with
all
despatch
to
the
village
and
impeach
our
hero
who
wisely
distrusting
her
professions
stayed
no
longer
in
the
place
than
to
hire
a
guide
for
the
next
stage
which
brought
him
to
the
city
of
chapter
he
arrives
at
paris
and
is
pleased
with
his
reception
he
was
not
so
smitten
with
the
delightful
situation
of
this
ancient
town
but
that
he
abandoned
it
as
soon
as
he
could
procure
a
in
which
he
arrived
at
paris
without
having
been
exposed
to
any
other
troublesome
adventure
upon
the
road
he
took
lodgings
at
a
certain
hotel
in
the
fauxbourg
de
germain
which
is
the
general
rendezvous
of
all
the
strangers
that
resort
to
this
capital
and
now
sincerely
congratulated
himself
upon
his
happy
escape
from
his
hungarian
connexions
and
from
the
snares
of
the
banditti
as
well
as
upon
the
spoils
of
the
dead
body
and
his
arrival
at
paris
from
whence
there
was
such
a
short
conveyance
to
england
whither
he
was
attracted
by
far
other
motives
than
that
of
filial
veneration
for
his
native
soil
he
suppressed
all
his
letters
of
recommendation
which
he
justly
concluded
would
subject
him
to
a
tedious
course
of
attendance
upon
the
great
and
lay
him
under
the
necessity
of
soliciting
preferment
in
the
army
than
which
nothing
was
farther
from
his
inclination
and
resolved
to
make
his
appearance
in
the
character
of
a
private
gentleman
which
would
supply
him
with
opportunities
of
examining
the
different
scenes
of
life
in
such
a
gay
metropolis
so
as
that
he
should
be
able
to
choose
that
sphere
in
which
he
could
move
the
most
effectually
to
his
own
advantage
he
accordingly
hired
an
occasional
domestic
and
under
the
denomination
of
count
fathom
which
he
had
retained
since
his
elopement
from
renaldo
repaired
to
dinner
at
an
ordinary
to
which
he
was
directed
as
a
reputable
place
frequented
by
fashionable
strangers
of
all
nations
he
found
this
piece
of
information
perfectly
just
for
he
no
sooner
entered
the
apartment
than
his
ears
were
saluted
with
a
strange
confusion
of
sounds
among
which
he
at
once
distinguished
the
high
and
low
dutch
barbarous
french
italian
and
english
languages
he
was
rejoiced
at
this
occasion
of
displaying
his
own
qualifications
took
his
place
at
one
of
the
three
long
tables
betwixt
a
westphalian
count
and
a
bolognian
marquis
insinuated
himself
into
the
conversation
with
his
usual
address
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
found
means
to
accost
a
native
of
each
different
country
in
his
own
such
extensive
knowledge
did
not
pass
unobserved
a
french
abbe
in
a
provincial
dialect
complimented
him
upon
his
retaining
that
purity
in
pronunciation
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
speech
of
a
parisian
the
bolognian
mistaking
him
for
a
tuscan
sir
said
he
i
presume
you
are
from
florence
i
hope
the
illustrious
house
of
lorrain
leaves
you
gentlemen
of
that
famous
city
no
room
to
regret
the
loss
of
your
own
princes
the
castle
of
versailles
becoming
the
subject
of
conversation
monsieur
le
compte
appealed
to
him
as
to
a
native
german
whether
it
was
not
inferior
in
point
of
magnificence
to
the
chateau
of
grubenhagen
the
dutch
officer
addressing
himself
to
fathom
drank
to
the
prosperity
of
faderland
and
asked
if
he
had
not
once
served
in
garrison
at
shenkenschans
and
an
english
knight
swore
with
great
assurance
that
he
had
frequently
rambled
with
him
at
midnight
among
the
hundreds
of
drury
to
each
person
he
replied
in
a
polite
though
mysterious
manner
which
did
not
fail
to
enhance
their
opinion
of
his
good
breeding
and
importance
and
long
before
the
dessert
appeared
he
was
by
all
the
company
supposed
to
be
a
personage
of
great
consequence
who
for
some
substantial
reasons
found
it
convenient
to
keep
himself
incognito
this
being
the
case
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
particular
civilities
were
poured
upon
him
from
all
quarters
he
perceived
their
sentiments
and
encouraged
them
by
behaving
with
that
sort
of
complaisance
which
seems
to
be
the
result
of
engaging
condescension
in
a
character
of
superior
dignity
and
station
his
affability
was
general
but
his
chief
attention
limited
to
those
gentlemen
already
mentioned
who
chanced
to
sit
nearest
him
at
table
and
he
no
sooner
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
was
an
utter
stranger
in
paris
than
they
unanimously
begged
to
have
the
honour
of
making
him
acquainted
with
the
different
curiosities
peculiar
to
that
metropolis
he
accepted
of
their
hospitality
accompanied
them
to
a
in
the
afternoon
from
whence
they
repaired
to
the
opera
and
afterwards
adjourned
to
a
noted
hotel
in
order
to
spend
the
remaining
part
of
the
evening
it
was
here
that
our
hero
secured
himself
effectually
in
the
footing
he
had
gained
in
their
good
graces
he
in
a
moment
saw
through
all
the
characters
of
the
party
and
adapted
himself
to
the
humour
of
each
individual
without
descending
from
that
elevation
of
behaviour
which
he
perceived
would
operate
among
them
in
his
behalf
with
the
italian
he
discoursed
on
music
in
the
style
of
a
connoisseur
and
indeed
had
a
better
claim
to
that
title
than
the
generality
of
those
upon
whom
it
is
usually
conferred
for
he
understood
the
art
in
theory
as
well
as
in
practice
and
would
have
made
no
contemptible
figure
among
the
best
performers
of
the
age
he
harangued
upon
taste
and
genius
to
the
abbe
who
was
a
wit
and
critic
ex
officio
or
rather
ex
vestitu
for
a
young
pert
frenchman
the
very
moment
he
puts
on
the
petit
collet
or
little
band
looks
upon
himself
as
an
inspired
son
of
apollo
and
every
one
of
the
fraternity
thinks
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
assert
the
divinity
of
his
mission
in
a
word
the
abbes
are
a
set
of
people
that
bear
a
strong
analogy
to
the
templars
in
london
fools
of
each
fabric
sharpers
of
all
sorts
and
dunces
of
every
degree
profess
themselves
of
both
orders
the
templar
is
generally
speaking
a
prig
so
is
the
abbe
both
are
distinguished
by
an
air
of
petulance
and
which
holds
a
middle
rank
betwixt
the
insolence
of
a
buck
and
the
learned
pride
of
a
supercilious
pedant
the
abbe
is
supposed
to
be
a
younger
brother
in
quest
of
preferment
in
the
church
the
temple
is
considered
as
a
receptacle
or
seminary
for
younger
sons
intended
for
the
bar
but
a
great
number
of
each
profession
turn
aside
into
other
paths
of
life
long
before
they
reach
these
proposed
goals
an
abbe
is
often
metamorphosed
into
a
foot
soldier
a
templar
sometimes
sinks
into
an
attorney
clerk
the
galleys
of
france
abound
with
abbes
and
many
templars
may
be
found
in
our
american
plantations
not
to
mention
those
who
have
made
a
public
exit
nearer
home
yet
i
would
not
have
it
thought
that
my
description
includes
every
individual
of
those
societies
some
of
the
greatest
scholars
politicians
and
wits
that
ever
europe
produced
have
worn
the
habit
of
an
abbe
and
many
of
our
most
noble
families
in
england
derive
their
honours
from
those
who
have
studied
law
in
the
temple
the
worthy
sons
of
every
community
shall
always
be
sacred
from
my
censure
and
ridicule
and
while
i
laugh
at
the
folly
of
particular
members
i
can
still
honour
and
revere
the
institution
but
let
us
return
from
this
comparison
which
some
readers
may
think
impertinent
and
unseasonable
and
observe
that
the
westphalian
count
dutch
officer
and
english
knight
were
not
excepted
from
the
particular
regard
and
attention
of
our
adventurer
he
pledged
the
german
in
every
bumper
flattered
the
hollander
with
compliments
upon
the
industry
wealth
and
policy
of
the
seven
united
provinces
but
he
reserved
his
chief
battery
for
his
own
countryman
on
the
supposition
that
he
was
in
all
respects
the
best
adapted
for
the
purposes
of
a
needy
gamester
him
therefore
he
cultivated
with
extraordinary
care
and
singular
observance
for
he
soon
perceived
him
to
be
a
humourist
and
from
that
circumstance
derived
an
happy
presage
of
his
own
success
the
disposition
seemed
to
be
cast
in
the
true
english
mould
he
was
sour
silent
and
contemptuous
his
very
looks
indicated
a
consciousness
of
superior
wealth
and
he
never
opened
his
mouth
except
to
make
some
dry
sarcastic
national
reflection
nor
was
his
behaviour
free
from
that
air
of
suspicion
which
a
man
puts
on
when
he
believes
himself
in
a
crowd
of
whom
his
caution
and
vigilance
set
at
defiance
in
a
word
though
his
tongue
was
silent
on
the
subject
his
whole
demeanour
was
continually
saying
you
are
all
a
pack
of
poor
lousy
rascals
who
have
a
design
upon
my
purse
is
true
i
could
buy
your
whole
generation
but
i
wo
be
bubbled
d
see
i
am
aware
of
your
flattery
and
upon
my
guard
against
all
your
knavish
pranks
and
i
come
into
your
company
for
my
own
amusement
only
fathom
having
reconnoitred
this
peculiarity
of
temper
instead
of
treating
him
with
that
assiduous
complaisance
which
he
received
from
the
other
gentlemen
of
the
party
kept
aloof
from
him
in
the
conversation
with
a
remarkable
shyness
of
distant
civility
and
seldom
took
notice
of
what
he
said
except
with
a
view
to
contradict
him
or
retort
some
of
his
satirical
observations
this
he
conceived
to
be
the
best
method
of
acquiring
his
good
opinion
because
the
englishman
would
naturally
conclude
he
was
a
person
who
could
have
no
sinister
views
upon
his
fortune
else
he
would
have
chosen
quite
a
different
manner
of
deportment
accordingly
the
knight
seemed
to
bite
at
the
hook
he
listened
to
ferdinand
with
uncommon
regard
he
was
even
heard
to
commend
his
remarks
and
at
length
drank
to
their
better
acquaintance
chapter
acquits
himself
with
address
in
a
nocturnal
riot
the
italian
and
the
abbe
were
the
first
who
began
to
grow
whimsical
under
the
influence
of
the
burgundy
and
in
the
heat
of
their
elevation
proposed
that
the
company
should
amuse
themselves
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
night
at
the
house
of
an
obliging
dame
who
maintained
a
troop
of
fair
nymphs
for
the
accommodation
of
the
other
sex
the
proposal
was
approved
by
all
except
the
hollander
whose
economy
the
wine
had
not
as
yet
invaded
and
while
he
retreated
soberly
to
his
own
lodgings
the
rest
of
the
society
adjourned
in
two
coaches
to
the
temple
of
love
where
they
were
received
by
the
venerable
priestess
a
personage
turned
of
seventy
who
seemed
to
exercise
the
functions
of
her
calling
in
despite
of
the
most
cruel
ravages
of
time
for
age
had
bent
her
into
the
form
of
a
turkish
bow
her
head
was
agitated
by
the
palsy
like
the
leaf
of
the
poplar
tree
her
hair
fell
down
in
scanty
parcels
as
white
as
the
driven
snow
her
face
was
not
simply
wrinkled
but
ploughed
into
innumerable
furrows
her
jaws
could
not
boast
of
one
remaining
tooth
one
eye
distilled
a
large
quantity
of
rheum
by
virtue
of
the
fiery
edge
that
surrounded
it
the
other
was
altogether
extinguished
and
she
had
lost
her
nose
in
the
course
of
her
ministration
the
delphic
sibyl
was
but
a
type
of
this
hoary
matron
who
by
her
figure
might
have
been
mistaken
for
the
consort
of
chaos
or
mother
of
time
yet
there
was
something
meritorious
in
her
appearance
as
it
denoted
her
an
indefatigable
minister
to
the
pleasure
of
mankind
and
as
it
formed
an
agreeable
contrast
with
the
beauty
and
youth
of
the
fair
damsels
that
wantoned
in
her
train
it
resembled
those
discords
in
music
which
properly
disposed
contribute
to
the
harmony
of
the
whole
piece
or
those
horrible
giants
who
in
the
world
of
romance
used
to
guard
the
gates
of
the
castle
in
which
the
enchanted
damsel
was
confined
this
urganda
seemed
to
be
aware
of
her
own
importance
and
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
human
appetite
for
she
compelled
the
whole
company
to
undergo
her
embrace
then
a
lacquey
in
magnificent
livery
ushered
them
into
a
superb
apartment
where
they
waited
some
minutes
without
being
favoured
with
the
appearance
of
the
ladies
to
the
manifest
dissatisfaction
of
the
abbe
who
sending
for
the
gouvernante
reprimanded
her
severely
for
her
want
of
politesse
the
old
lady
who
was
by
no
means
a
pattern
of
patience
and
submission
retorted
his
reproaches
with
great
emphasis
and
vivacity
her
eloquence
flowed
altogether
in
the
covent
garden
strain
and
i
question
whether
the
celebrated
mother
douglas
herself
could
have
made
such
a
figure
in
an
extemporaneous
altercation
after
having
bestowed
upon
the
abbe
the
epithets
of
saucy
insignificant
pimp
she
put
him
in
mind
of
the
good
offices
which
he
had
received
at
her
hands
how
she
had
supplied
him
with
bed
board
and
bedfellow
in
his
greatest
necessity
sent
him
abroad
with
money
in
his
pockets
and
in
a
word
cherished
him
in
her
bosom
when
his
own
mother
had
abandoned
him
to
distress
she
then
reviled
him
for
presuming
to
affront
her
before
strangers
and
gave
the
company
to
understand
that
the
young
ladies
would
wait
upon
them
as
soon
as
they
could
be
confessed
and
receive
absolution
from
a
worthy
cordelier
who
was
now
employed
in
performing
that
charitable
office
the
gentlemen
were
satisfied
with
this
remonstrance
which
argued
the
old
lady
pious
concern
for
the
souls
that
were
under
her
care
and
our
adventurer
proposed
an
accommodation
betwixt
her
and
the
abbe
who
was
prevailed
upon
to
ask
her
pardon
and
received
her
blessing
upon
his
knees
this
affair
had
not
been
long
adjusted
when
five
damsels
were
introduced
in
a
very
gay
dishabille
and
our
hero
was
complimented
with
the
privilege
of
choosing
his
amanda
from
the
whole
bevy
when
he
was
provided
the
others
began
to
pair
themselves
and
unhappily
the
german
count
chanced
to
pitch
upon
the
same
nymph
who
had
captivated
the
desires
of
the
british
knight
a
dispute
immediately
ensued
for
the
englishman
made
his
addresses
to
the
lady
without
paying
the
least
regard
to
the
priority
of
the
other
claim
and
she
being
pleased
with
his
attachment
did
not
scruple
to
renounce
his
rival
who
swore
by
the
thunder
lightning
and
sacrament
that
he
would
not
quit
his
pretensions
for
any
prince
in
christendom
much
less
for
a
little
english
cavalier
whom
he
had
already
honoured
too
much
in
condescending
to
be
his
companion
the
knight
provoked
at
this
stately
declaration
which
was
the
immediate
effect
of
anger
and
ebriety
eyed
his
antagonist
with
a
most
contemptuous
aspect
and
advised
him
to
avoid
such
comparisons
for
the
future
we
all
know
said
he
the
importance
of
a
german
count
i
suppose
your
revenue
amounts
to
three
hundred
and
you
have
a
chateau
that
looks
like
the
ruins
of
an
english
gaol
i
will
bind
myself
to
lend
you
a
thousand
pounds
upon
a
mortgage
of
your
estate
and
a
bad
bargain
i
am
sure
i
shall
have
if
i
do
not
in
less
than
two
months
find
a
yeoman
of
kent
who
spends
more
in
strong
ale
than
the
of
your
yearly
income
and
were
the
truth
known
i
believe
that
lace
upon
your
coat
is
no
better
than
tinsel
and
those
fringed
ruffles
with
fine
holland
sleeves
tacked
to
a
shirt
of
brown
canvas
so
that
were
you
to
undress
yourself
before
the
lady
you
would
only
expose
your
own
poverty
and
pride
the
count
was
so
much
enraged
at
these
sarcastic
observations
that
his
faculty
of
speech
was
overwhelmed
by
his
resentment
though
in
order
to
acquit
himself
of
the
englishman
imputation
he
forthwith
pulled
off
his
clothes
with
such
fury
that
his
brocade
waistcoat
was
tore
from
top
to
bottom
the
knight
mistaking
his
meaning
considered
this
demeanour
as
a
fair
challenge
to
try
which
was
the
better
man
in
the
exercise
of
boxing
and
on
that
supposition
began
to
strip
in
his
turn
when
he
was
undeceived
by
fathom
who
put
the
right
interpretation
upon
the
behaviour
and
begged
that
the
affair
might
be
compromised
by
this
time
the
westphalian
recovered
the
use
of
his
tongue
and
with
many
threats
and
imprecations
desired
they
would
take
notice
how
falsely
he
had
been
aspersed
and
do
him
justice
in
espousing
his
claim
to
the
damsel
in
question
before
the
company
had
time
or
inclination
to
interest
themselves
in
the
quarrel
his
opponent
observed
that
no
person
who
was
not
a
mere
german
would
ever
dream
of
forcing
the
inclinations
of
a
pretty
girl
whom
the
accidents
of
fortune
had
subjected
to
his
power
that
such
compulsion
was
equivalent
to
the
most
cruel
rape
that
could
be
committed
and
that
the
lady
aversion
was
not
at
all
surprising
for
to
speak
his
own
sentiments
were
he
a
woman
of
pleasure
he
would
as
soon
grant
favours
to
a
westphalian
hog
as
to
the
person
of
his
antagonist
the
german
enraged
at
this
comparison
was
quite
abandoned
by
his
patience
and
discretion
he
called
the
knight
an
english
clown
and
swearing
he
was
the
most
untoward
beast
of
a
whole
nation
of
mules
snatched
up
one
of
the
candlesticks
which
he
launched
at
him
with
such
force
and
violence
that
it
sung
through
the
air
and
winging
its
flight
into
the
encountered
the
skull
of
his
own
valet
who
with
immediate
prostration
received
the
message
of
his
master
the
knight
that
he
might
not
be
behindhand
with
the
westphalian
in
point
of
courtesy
returned
the
compliment
with
the
remaining
chandelier
which
also
missed
its
mark
and
smiting
a
large
mirror
that
was
fixed
behind
them
emitted
such
a
crash
as
one
might
expect
to
hear
if
a
mine
were
sprung
beneath
a
manufacture
of
glass
both
lights
being
thus
extinguished
a
furious
combat
ensued
in
the
dark
the
italian
scampered
off
with
infinite
agility
and
as
he
went
downstairs
desired
that
nobody
would
interpose
because
it
was
an
affair
of
honour
which
could
not
be
made
up
the
ladies
consulted
their
safety
in
flight
count
fathom
slyly
retired
to
one
corner
of
the
room
while
the
abbe
having
upon
him
the
terrors
of
the
commissaire
endeavoured
to
appease
and
part
the
combatants
and
in
the
attempt
sustained
a
random
blow
upon
his
nose
which
sent
him
howling
into
the
other
chamber
where
finding
his
band
besmeared
with
his
own
blood
he
began
to
caper
about
the
apartment
in
a
transport
of
rage
and
vexation
meanwhile
the
old
gentlewoman
being
alarmed
with
the
noise
of
the
battle
and
apprehensive
that
it
would
end
in
murder
to
the
danger
and
discredit
of
herself
and
family
immediately
mustered
up
her
myrmidons
of
whom
she
always
retained
a
formidable
band
and
putting
herself
at
their
head
lighted
them
to
the
scene
of
uproar
ferdinand
who
had
hitherto
observed
a
strict
neutrality
no
sooner
perceived
them
approach
than
he
leaped
in
between
the
disputants
that
he
might
be
found
acting
in
the
character
of
a
peacemaker
and
indeed
by
this
time
victory
had
declared
for
the
baronet
who
had
treated
his
antagonist
with
a
which
laid
him
almost
breathless
on
the
floor
the
victor
was
prevailed
upon
by
the
entreaties
of
fathom
to
quit
the
field
of
battle
and
adjourn
into
another
room
where
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
received
a
billet
from
the
count
defying
him
to
single
combat
on
the
frontiers
of
flanders
at
an
appointed
time
and
place
the
challenge
was
immediately
accepted
by
the
knight
who
being
flushed
with
conquest
treated
his
adversary
with
great
contempt
but
next
day
when
the
fumes
of
the
burgundy
were
quite
exhaled
and
the
adventure
recurred
to
his
remembrance
and
sober
reflection
he
waited
upon
our
adventurer
at
his
lodgings
and
solicited
his
advice
in
such
a
manner
as
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
looked
upon
what
had
happened
as
a
drunken
brawl
which
ought
to
have
no
serious
consequences
fathom
foreseeing
that
the
affair
might
be
managed
for
his
own
interest
professed
himself
of
the
baronet
opinion
and
without
hesitation
undertook
the
office
of
a
mediator
assuring
his
principal
that
his
honour
should
suffer
no
stain
in
the
course
of
his
negotiation
having
received
the
englishman
acknowledgments
for
this
instance
of
friendship
he
forthwith
set
out
for
the
place
of
the
habitation
and
understanding
he
was
still
asleep
insisted
upon
his
being
immediately
waked
and
told
that
a
gentleman
from
the
chevalier
desired
to
see
him
upon
business
of
importance
which
could
not
be
delayed
accordingly
his
pressed
by
importunities
and
remonstrances
ventured
to
go
in
and
shake
the
count
by
the
shoulder
when
this
furious
teutonian
still
agitated
by
the
fever
of
the
preceding
night
leaped
out
of
bed
in
a
frenzy
and
seizing
his
sword
that
lay
upon
a
table
would
have
severely
punished
the
presumption
of
his
servant
had
not
he
been
restrained
by
the
entrance
of
ferdinand
who
with
a
peremptory
countenance
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
valet
had
acted
at
his
immediate
instigation
and
that
he
was
come
as
the
englishman
friend
to
concert
with
him
proper
measures
for
keeping
the
appointment
they
had
made
at
their
last
meeting
this
message
effectually
calmed
the
german
who
was
not
a
little
mortified
to
find
himself
so
disagreeably
disturbed
he
could
not
help
cursing
the
impatience
of
his
antagonist
and
even
hinting
that
he
would
have
acted
more
like
a
gentleman
and
good
christian
in
expressing
a
desire
of
seeing
the
affair
accommodated
as
he
knew
himself
to
be
the
aggressor
consequently
the
first
offender
against
the
laws
of
politeness
and
fathom
finding
him
in
a
fit
temper
of
mind
took
the
opportunity
of
assenting
to
the
reasonableness
of
his
observation
he
ventured
to
condemn
the
impetuosity
of
the
baronet
who
he
perceived
was
extremely
nice
and
scrupulous
in
the
punctilios
of
honour
and
said
it
was
a
pity
that
two
gentlemen
should
forfeit
each
other
friendship
much
less
expose
their
lives
for
such
a
frivolous
cause
my
dear
count
cried
the
westphalian
i
am
charmed
to
find
your
sentiments
so
conformable
to
my
own
in
an
honourable
cause
i
despise
all
danger
my
courage
thank
heaven
has
been
manifested
in
many
public
engagements
as
well
as
in
private
rencounters
but
to
break
with
my
friend
whose
eminent
virtues
i
admire
and
even
to
seek
his
life
on
such
a
scandalous
occasion
for
a
little
insignificant
w
who
i
suppose
took
the
advantage
of
our
intoxication
to
foment
the
quarrel
by
heaven
my
conscience
can
not
digest
it
having
expressed
himself
to
this
purpose
he
waited
impatiently
for
the
reply
of
ferdinand
who
after
a
pause
of
deliberation
offered
his
services
in
the
way
of
mediation
though
he
observed
it
was
a
matter
of
great
delicacy
and
the
event
altogether
uncertain
nevertheless
added
our
adventurer
i
will
strive
to
appease
the
knight
who
i
hope
will
be
induced
by
my
remonstrances
to
forget
the
unlucky
accident
which
hath
so
disagreeably
interrupted
your
mutual
friendship
the
german
thanked
him
for
this
proof
of
his
regard
which
yielded
him
more
satisfaction
on
account
of
the
chevalier
than
of
himself
for
by
the
tombs
of
my
fathers
cried
he
i
have
so
little
concern
for
my
personal
safety
that
if
my
honour
were
interested
i
durst
oppose
myself
singly
to
the
whole
ban
of
the
empire
and
i
am
now
ready
if
the
chevalier
requires
it
to
give
him
the
rendezvous
in
the
forest
of
senlis
either
on
horseback
or
on
foot
where
this
contest
may
be
terminated
with
the
life
of
one
or
both
of
us
count
fathom
with
a
view
to
chastise
the
westphalian
for
this
rhodomontade
told
him
with
a
mortifying
air
of
indifference
that
if
they
were
both
bent
upon
taking
the
field
he
would
save
himself
the
trouble
of
interposing
farther
in
the
affair
and
desired
to
know
the
hour
at
which
it
would
suit
him
to
take
the
air
with
the
baronet
the
other
not
a
little
embarrassed
by
this
question
said
with
a
faltering
tongue
he
should
be
proud
to
obey
the
chevalier
orders
but
at
the
same
time
owned
he
should
be
much
better
pleased
if
our
hero
would
execute
the
pacific
proposal
he
had
made
fathom
accordingly
promised
to
exert
himself
for
that
purpose
and
returned
to
the
knight
with
whom
he
assumed
the
merit
of
having
tranquillised
the
rage
of
an
incensed
barbarian
who
was
now
disposed
to
a
reconciliation
upon
equal
terms
the
baronet
overwhelmed
him
with
caresses
and
compliments
upon
his
friendship
and
address
the
parties
met
that
same
forenoon
as
if
by
accident
in
fathom
apartment
where
they
embraced
each
other
cordially
exchanged
apologies
and
renewed
their
former
correspondence
our
adventurer
thought
he
had
good
reason
to
congratulate
himself
upon
the
part
he
had
acted
in
this
pacification
he
was
treated
by
both
with
signal
marks
of
particular
affection
and
esteem
the
count
pressed
him
to
accept
as
a
token
of
his
attachment
a
sword
of
very
curious
workmanship
which
he
had
received
in
a
present
from
a
certain
prince
of
the
empire
the
knight
forced
upon
his
finger
a
very
splendid
diamond
ring
as
a
testimony
of
his
gratitude
and
esteem
but
there
was
still
another
person
to
be
appeased
before
the
peace
of
the
whole
company
could
be
established
this
was
no
other
than
the
abbe
from
whom
each
of
the
reconciled
friends
received
at
dinner
a
billet
couched
in
these
words
i
have
the
honour
to
lament
the
infinite
chagrin
and
mortification
that
compels
me
to
address
myself
in
this
manner
to
a
person
of
your
rank
and
eminence
whom
i
should
do
myself
the
pleasure
of
waiting
upon
in
person
were
i
not
prevented
by
the
misfortune
of
my
nose
which
was
last
night
most
cruelly
disarranged
by
a
violent
contusion
i
had
the
honour
to
receive
in
attempting
to
compose
that
unhappy
fracas
at
the
house
of
madame
la
maquerelle
and
what
puts
the
finishing
stroke
to
my
mishap
is
my
being
rendered
incapable
of
keeping
three
or
four
assignations
with
ladies
of
fashion
by
whom
i
have
the
honour
to
be
particularly
esteemed
the
disfiguration
of
my
nose
the
pain
i
have
undergone
with
the
discomposure
of
brain
which
it
produced
i
could
bear
as
a
philosopher
but
the
disappointment
of
the
ladies
my
glory
will
not
permit
me
to
overlook
and
as
you
know
the
injury
was
sustained
in
your
service
i
have
the
pleasure
to
hope
you
will
not
refuse
to
grant
such
reparation
as
will
be
acceptable
to
a
gentleman
who
has
the
honour
to
be
with
inviolable
attachment
sir
your
most
devoted
slave
pepin
clothaire
charle
henri
loouis
barnabe
de
fumier
this
epistle
was
so
equivocal
that
the
persons
to
whom
it
was
addressed
did
not
know
whether
or
not
they
ought
to
interpret
the
contents
into
a
challenge
when
our
hero
observed
that
the
ambiguity
of
his
expressions
plainly
proved
there
was
a
door
left
open
for
accommodation
and
proposed
that
they
should
forthwith
visit
the
writer
at
his
own
apartment
they
accordingly
followed
his
advice
and
found
the
abbe
in
his
morning
gown
and
slippers
with
three
huge
nightcaps
on
his
head
and
a
crape
tied
over
the
middle
of
his
face
by
way
of
bandage
to
his
nose
he
received
his
visitors
with
the
most
ridiculous
solemnity
being
still
a
stranger
to
the
purport
of
their
errand
but
soon
as
the
westphalian
declared
they
were
come
in
consequence
of
his
billet
in
order
to
ask
pardon
for
the
undesigned
offence
they
had
given
his
features
retrieved
their
natural
vivacity
and
he
professed
himself
perfectly
satisfied
with
their
polite
acknowledgment
then
they
condoled
him
upon
the
evil
plight
of
his
nose
and
seeing
some
marks
upon
his
shirt
asked
with
seeming
concern
if
he
had
lost
any
blood
in
the
fray
to
this
interrogation
he
replied
that
he
had
still
a
sufficient
quantity
left
for
the
occasions
of
his
friends
and
that
he
should
deem
it
his
greatest
glory
to
expend
the
last
drop
of
it
in
their
service
matters
being
thus
amicably
adjusted
they
prevailed
upon
him
to
unease
his
nose
which
retained
no
signs
of
the
outrage
he
had
suffered
and
the
amusements
of
the
day
were
concerted
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
plan
that
after
the
comedy
they
were
entertained
at
the
lodgings
where
quadrille
was
proposed
by
the
abbe
as
the
most
innocent
pastime
and
the
proposal
was
immediately
embraced
by
all
present
and
by
none
with
more
alacrity
than
by
our
adventurer
who
without
putting
forth
a
moiety
of
his
skill
went
home
with
twenty
louis
clear
gain
though
far
from
believing
himself
greatly
superior
to
the
rest
of
the
party
in
the
artifices
of
play
he
justly
suspected
that
they
had
concealed
their
skill
with
a
view
of
stripping
him
on
some
other
occasion
for
he
could
not
suppose
that
persons
of
their
figure
and
character
should
be
in
reality
such
novices
as
they
affected
to
appear
chapter
he
overlooks
the
advances
of
his
friends
and
smarts
severely
for
his
neglect
steeled
with
this
cautious
maxim
he
guarded
himself
from
their
united
endeavours
in
sundry
subsequent
attacks
by
which
his
first
conjecture
was
confirmed
and
still
came
off
conqueror
by
virtue
of
his
unparalleled
finesse
and
discretion
till
at
length
they
seemed
to
despair
of
making
him
their
prey
and
the
count
began
to
drop
some
hints
importing
a
desire
of
seeing
him
more
closely
united
to
the
views
and
interest
of
their
triumvirate
but
ferdinand
who
was
altogether
selfish
and
quite
solitary
in
his
prospects
discouraged
all
those
advances
being
resolved
to
trade
upon
his
own
bottom
only
and
to
avoid
all
such
connexions
with
any
person
or
society
whatever
much
more
with
a
set
of
raw
adventurers
whose
talents
he
despised
with
these
sentiments
he
still
maintained
the
dignity
and
reserve
of
his
first
appearance
among
them
and
rather
enhanced
than
diminished
that
idea
of
importance
which
he
had
inspired
at
the
beginning
because
besides
his
other
qualifications
they
gave
him
credit
for
the
address
with
which
he
kept
himself
superior
to
their
united
designs
while
he
thus
enjoyed
his
together
with
the
fruits
of
his
success
at
play
which
he
managed
so
discreetly
as
never
to
incur
the
reputation
of
an
adventurer
he
one
day
chanced
to
be
at
the
ordinary
when
the
company
was
surprised
by
the
entrance
of
such
a
figure
as
had
never
appeared
before
in
that
place
this
was
no
other
than
a
person
habited
in
the
exact
uniform
of
an
english
jockey
his
leathern
cap
cut
bob
fustian
frock
flannel
waistcoat
buff
breeches
and
whip
were
sufficient
of
themselves
to
furnish
out
a
phenomenon
for
the
admiration
of
all
paris
but
these
peculiarities
were
rendered
still
more
conspicuous
by
the
behaviour
of
the
man
who
owned
them
when
he
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
outward
door
he
produced
such
a
sound
from
the
smack
of
his
whip
as
equalled
the
explosion
of
an
ordinary
cohorn
and
then
broke
forth
into
the
halloo
of
a
foxhunter
which
he
uttered
with
all
its
variations
in
a
strain
of
vociferation
that
seemed
to
astonish
and
confound
the
whole
assembly
to
whom
he
introduced
himself
and
his
spaniel
by
exclaiming
in
a
tone
something
less
melodious
than
the
cry
of
mackerel
or
live
cod
by
your
leave
gentlevolks
i
hope
there
no
offence
in
an
honest
plain
englishman
coming
with
money
in
his
pocket
to
taste
a
bit
of
your
vrench
frigasee
and
ragooze
this
declaration
was
made
in
such
a
wild
fantastical
manner
that
the
greatest
part
of
the
company
mistook
him
for
some
savage
monster
or
maniac
and
consulted
their
safety
by
starting
up
from
table
and
drawing
their
swords
the
englishman
seeing
such
a
martial
apparatus
produced
against
him
recoiled
two
or
three
steps
saying
waunds
a
believe
the
people
are
all
bewitched
what
do
they
take
me
for
a
beast
of
prey
is
there
nobody
here
that
knows
sir
stentor
stile
or
can
speak
to
me
in
my
own
lingo
he
had
no
sooner
pronounced
these
words
than
the
baronet
with
marks
of
infinite
surprise
ran
towards
him
crying
good
heaven
sir
stentor
who
expected
to
meet
with
you
in
paris
upon
which
the
other
eyeing
him
very
earnestly

cried
he
my
neighbour
sir

as

soul
with
these
words
he
flew
upon
him
like
a
tiger
kissed
him
from
ear
to
ear
demolished
his
periwig
and
disordered
the
whole
economy
of
his
dress
to
the
no
small
entertainment
of
the
company
having
stifled
his
countryman
with
embraces
and
besmeared
himself
with
pulville
from
head
to
foot
he
proceeded
in
this
manner
mercy
upon
thee
knight
thou
art
so
transmographied
and
bedaubed
and
bedizened
that
thou
mought

among
you
these
compliments
being
passed
the
two
knights
sat
down
by
one
another
and
sir
stentor
being
asked
by
his
neighbour
upon
what
errand
he
had
crossed
the
sea
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
had
come
to
france
in
consequence
of
a
wager
with
squire
snaffle
who
had
laid
a
thousand
pounds
that
he
sir
stentor
would
not
travel
to
paris
by
himself
and
for
a
whole
month
appear
every
day
at
a
certain
hour
in
the
public
walks
without
wearing
any
other
dress
than
that
in
which
he
saw
him
the
fellor
has
got
no
more
stuff
in
his
pate
continued
this
polite
stranger
than
a
jackass
to
think
i
could
not
find
my
way
hither
thof
i
could
not
jabber
your
french
lingo
ecod
the
people
of
this
country
are
sharp
enough
to
find
out
your
meaning
when
you
want
to
spend
anything
among
them
and
as
for
the
matter
of
dress
bodikins
for
a
thousand
pound
i
would
engage
to
live
in
the
midst
of
them
and
show
myself
without
any
clothes
at
all
odds
heart
a
englishman
needs
not
be
ashamed
to
show
his
face
nor
his
backside
neither
with
the
best
frenchman
that
ever
trod
the
ground
thof
we
englishmen
do
beplaister
our
doublets
with
gold
and
silver
i
believe
as
how
we
have
our
pockets
better
lined
than
most
of
our
neighbours
and
for
all
my
bit
of
a
fustian
frock
that
cost
me
in
all
but
forty
shillings
i
believe
between
you
and
me
knight
i
have
more
dust
in
my
fob
than
all
those
powdered
sparks
put
together
but
the
worst
of
the
matter
is
this
here
is
no
solid
in
this
country
one
ca
have
a
slice
of
delicate
sirloin
or
nice
buttock
of
beef
for
love
nor

i
could
get
no
eatables
upon
the
ruoad
but
what
they
called
bully
which
looks
like
the
flesh
of
pharaoh
lean
kine
stewed
into
rags
and
tatters
and
then
their
peajohn
peajohn
rabbet
them
one
would
think
every
old
woman
of
this
kingdom
hatched
pigeons
from
her
own
body
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
such
an
original
sat
unobserved
the
french
and
other
foreigners
who
had
never
been
in
england
were
struck
dumb
with
amazement
at
the
knight
appearance
and
deportment
while
the
english
guests
were
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
confusion
and
kept
a
most
wary
silence
for
fear
of
being
recognised
by
their
countryman
as
for
our
adventurer
he
was
inwardly
transported
with
joy
at
sight
of
this
curiosity
he
considered
him
as
a
genuine
rich
country
booby
of
the
right
english
growth
fresh
as
imported
and
his
heart
throbbed
with
rapture
when
he
heard
sir
stentor
value
himself
upon
the
lining
of
his
pockets
he
foresaw
indeed
that
the
other
knight
would
endeavour
to
reserve
him
for
his
own
game
but
he
was
too
conscious
of
his
own
accomplishments
to
think
he
should
find
great
difficulty
in
superseding
the
influence
of
sir
giles
meanwhile
the
was
by
his
friend
helped
to
some
ragout
which
pleased
his
palate
so
well
that
he
declared
he
should
now
make
a
hearty
meal
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
crossed
the
water
and
while
his
prevailed
he
drank
to
every
individual
around
the
table
ferdinand
seized
this
opportunity
of
insinuating
himself
into
his
favour
by
saying
in
english
he
was
glad
to
find
there
was
anything
in
france
that
was
agreeable
to
sir
stentor
to
this
compliment
the
knight
replied
with
an
air
of
surprise
waunds
i
find
here
another
countryman
of
mine
in
this
here
company
sir
i
am
proud
to
see
you
with
all
my
heart
so
speaking
he
thrust
out
his
right
hand
across
the
table
and
shook
our
hero
by
the
fist
with
such
violence
of
civility
as
proved
very
grievous
to
a
french
marquis
who
in
helping
himself
to
soup
was
jostled
in
such
a
manner
as
to
overturn
the
in
his
own
bosom
the
englishman
seeing
the
mischief
he
had
produced
cried
no
offence
i
hope
in
a
tone
of
vociferation
which
the
marquis
in
all
probability
misconstrued
for
he
began
to
model
his
features
into
a
very
sublime
and
peremptory
look
when
fathom
interpreted
the
apology
and
at
the
same
time
informed
sir
stentor
that
although
he
himself
had
not
the
honour
of
being
an
englishman
he
had
always
entertained
a
most
particular
veneration
for
the
country
and
learned
the
language
in
consequence
of
that
esteem
blood
answered
the
knight
i
think
myself
the
more
obliged
to
you
for
your
kind
opinion
than
if
you
was
my
countryman
in
good
earnest
for
there
be
abundance
of
we
english
no
offence
sir
giles
that
seem
to
be
ashamed
of
their
own
nation
and
leave
their
homes
to
come
and
spend
their
fortunes
abroad
among
a
parcel
of
you
understand
me
sir
a
word
to
the
wise
as
the
saying
is
here
he
was
interrupted
by
an
article
of
the
second
course
that
seemed
to
give
him
great
disturbance
this
was
a
roasted
leveret
very
strong
of
the
fumet
which
happened
to
be
placed
directly
under
his
nose
his
sense
of
smelling
was
no
sooner
encountered
by
the
effluvia
of
this
delicious
fare
than
he
started
up
from
table
exclaiming
odd
my
liver
here
a
piece
of
carrion
that
i
would
not
offer
to
a
hound
in
my
kennel
is
enough
to
make
any
christian
vomit
both
gut
and
gall
and
indeed
by
the
wry
faces
he
made
while
he
ran
to
the
door
his
stomach
seemed
ready
to
justify
this
last
assertion
the
abbe
who
concluded
from
these
symptoms
of
disgust
that
the
leveret
was
not
sufficiently
stale
began
to
exhibit
marks
of
discontent
and
desired
that
it
might
be
brought
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
for
his
examination
he
accordingly
hung
over
it
with
the
most
greedy
appetite
feasting
his
nostrils
with
the
steams
of
animal
putrefaction
and
at
length
declared
that
the
morceau
was
passable
though
he
owned
it
would
have
been
highly
perfect
had
it
been
kept
another
week
nevertheless
mouths
were
not
wanting
to
discuss
it
insipid
as
it
was
for
in
three
minutes
there
was
not
a
vestige
to
be
seen
of
that
which
had
offended
the
organs
of
sir
stentor
who
now
resumed
his
place
and
did
justice
to
the
dessert
but
what
he
seemed
to
relish
better
than
any
other
part
of
the
entertainment
was
the
conversation
of
our
adventurer
whom
after
dinner
he
begged
to
have
the
honour
of
treating
with
a
dish
of
coffee
to
the
seeming
mortification
of
his
brother
knight
over
which
fathom
exulted
in
his
own
heart
in
short
our
hero
by
his
affability
and
engaging
deportment
immediately
gained
possession
of
sir
stentor
good
graces
insomuch
that
he
desired
to
crack
a
bottle
with
him
in
the
evening
and
they
repaired
to
an
auberge
whither
his
accompanied
him
not
without
manifest
signs
of
reluctance
there
the
stranger
gave
a
loose
to
jollity
though
at
first
he
d
the
burgundy
as
a
poor
thin
liquor
that
ran
through
him
in
a
twinkling
and
instead
of
warming
cooled
his
heart
and
bowels
however
it
insensibly
seemed
to
give
the
lie
to
his
imputation
for
his
spirits
rose
to
a
more
elevated
pitch
of
mirth
and
he
sung
or
rather
roared
the
early
horn
so
as
to
alarm
the
whole
neighbourhood
and
began
to
slabber
his
companions
with
a
most
affection
yet
whatever
haste
he
made
to
the
goal
of
ebriety
he
was
distanced
by
his
brother
baronet
who
from
the
beginning
of
the
party
had
made
little
other
use
of
his
mouth
than
to
receive
the
glass
and
now
sunk
down
upon
the
floor
in
a
state
of
temporary
annihilation
he
was
immediately
carried
to
bed
by
the
direction
of
ferdinand
who
now
saw
himself
in
a
manner
possessor
of
that
mine
to
which
he
had
made
such
eager
and
artful
advances
that
he
might
therefore
carry
on
the
approaches
in
the
same
cautious
manner
he
gradually
shook
off
the
trammels
of
sobriety
gave
a
loose
to
that
spirit
of
freedom
which
good
liquor
commonly
inspires
and
in
the
familiarity
of
drunkenness
owned
himself
head
of
a
noble
family
of
poland
from
which
he
had
been
obliged
to
absent
himself
on
account
of
an
affair
of
honour
not
yet
compromised
having
made
this
confession
and
laid
strong
injunctions
of
secrecy
upon
sir
stentor
his
countenance
seemed
to
acquire
from
every
succeeding
glass
a
new
symptom
of
intoxication
they
renewed
their
embraces
swore
eternal
friendship
from
that
day
and
swallowed
fresh
bumpers
till
both
being
in
all
appearance
quite
overpowered
they
began
to
yawn
in
concert
and
even
nod
in
their
chairs
the
knight
seemed
to
resent
the
attacks
of
slumber
as
so
many
impertinent
attempts
to
interrupt
their
entertainment
he
cursed
his
own
propensity
to
sleep
imputing
it
to
the
d
french
climate
and
proposed
to
engage
in
some
pastime
that
would
keep
them
awake
odd
flesh
cried
the
briton
when
i
at
home
i
defy
all
the
devils
in
hell
to
fasten
my
eyelids
together
if
so
be
as
i
otherwise
inclined
for
there
mother
and
sister
nan
and
brother
numps
and
i
continue
to
divert
ourselves
at
brag
cribbage
tetotum
husslecap
and
and
thof
i
say
it
that
should
say
it
i
wo
turn
my
back
to
a
he
in
england
at
any
of
these
pastimes
and
so
count
if
you
are
so
disposed
i
am
your
man
that
is
in
the
way
of
friendship
at
which
of
these
you
shall
please
to
pitch
upon
to
this
proposal
fathom
replied
he
was
quite
ignorant
of
all
the
games
he
had
mentioned
but
in
order
to
amuse
sir
stentor
he
would
play
with
him
at
lansquenet
for
a
trifle
as
he
had
laid
it
down
for
a
maxim
to
risk
nothing
considerable
at
play
waunds
answered
the
knight
i
hope
you
do
think
i
come
here
in
quest
of
money
thank
god
i
have
a
good
landed
estate
worth
five
thousand
a
year
and
owe
no
man
a
halfpenny
and
i
question
whether
there
be
many
counts
in
your
nation
no
offence
i
hope
that
can
say
a
bolder
word
as
for
your
lambskin
net
i
know
nothing
of
the
matter
but
i
will
toss
up
with
you
for
a
guinea
cross
or
pile
as
the
saying
is
or
if
there
such
a
thing
in
this
country
as
a
box
and
dice
i
love
to
hear
the
bones
rattle
sometimes
fathom
found
some
difficulty
in
concealing
his
joy
at
the
mention
of
this
last
amusement
which
had
been
one
of
his
chief
studies
and
in
which
he
had
made
such
progress
that
he
could
calculate
all
the
chances
with
the
utmost
exactness
and
certainty
however
he
made
shift
to
contain
himself
within
due
bounds
and
with
seeming
indifference
consented
to
pass
away
an
hour
at
hazard
provided
the
implements
could
be
procured
accordingly
the
landlord
was
consulted
and
their
desire
gratified
the
dice
were
produced
and
the
table
resounded
with
the
effects
of
their
mutual
eagerness
fortune
at
first
declared
for
the
englishman
who
was
permitted
by
our
adventurer
to
win
twenty
broad
pieces
and
he
was
so
elated
with
his
success
as
to
accompany
every
lucky
throw
with
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
and
other
savage
and
simple
manifestations
of
excessive
joy
exclaiming
in
a
tone
something
less
sweet
than
the
bellowing
of
a
bull
now
for
the
main
count
odd
here
they
come
here
are
the
seven
black
stars
come
along
my
yellow
boys
heart
i
never
liked
the
face
of
lewis
before
fathom
drew
happy
presages
from
these
boyish
raptures
and
after
having
indulged
them
for
some
time
began
to
avail
himself
of
his
arithmetic
in
consequence
of
which
the
knight
was
obliged
to
refund
the
greatest
part
of
his
winning
then
he
altered
his
note
and
became
as
intemperate
in
his
chagrin
as
he
had
been
before
immoderate
in
his
mirth
he
cursed
himself
and
his
whole
generation
d
his
bad
luck
stamped
with
his
feet
upon
the
floor
and
challenged
ferdinand
to
double
stakes
this
was
a
very
welcome
proposal
to
our
hero
who
found
sir
stentor
just
such
a
subject
as
he
had
long
desired
to
encounter
with
the
more
the
englishman
laid
the
more
he
lost
and
fathom
took
care
to
inflame
his
passions
by
certain
sarcasms
upon
his
want
of
judgment
till
at
length
he
became
quite
outrageous
swore
the
dice
were
false
and
threw
them
out
at
the
window
pulled
off
his
periwig
and
committed
it
to
the
flames
spoke
with
the
most
rancorous
contempt
of
his
adversary
skill
insisted
upon
his
having
stripped
many
a
better
man
for
all
he
was
a
count
and
threatening
that
before
they
parted
he
should
not
only
look
like
a
pole
but
also
smell
like
a
this
was
a
spirit
which
our
adventurer
industriously
kept
up
observing
that
the
english
were
dupes
to
all
the
world
and
that
in
point
of
genius
and
address
they
were
no
more
than
noisy
braggadocios
in
short
another
pair
of
dice
was
procured
the
stakes
were
again
raised
and
after
several
vicissitudes
fortune
declared
so
much
in
favour
of
the
knight
that
fathom
lost
all
the
money
in
his
pocket
amounting
to
a
pretty
considerable
sum
by
this
time
he
was
warmed
into
uncommon
eagerness
and
impatience
being
equally
piqued
at
the
success
and
provoking
exultations
of
his
antagonist
whom
he
now
invited
to
his
lodgings
in
order
to
decide
the
contest
sir
stentor
complied
with
this
request
the
dispute
was
renewed
with
various
success
till
towards
daylight
ferdinand
saw
this
noisy
raw
inexperienced
simpleton
carry
off
all
his
ready
cash
together
with
his
jewels
and
almost
everything
that
was
valuable
about
his
person
and
to
crown
the
whole
the
victor
at
parting
told
him
with
a
most
intolerable
sneer
that
as
soon
as
the
count
should
receive
another
remittance
from
poland
he
would
give
him
his
revenge
chapter
he
bears
his
fate
like
a
philosopher
and
contracts
acquaintance
with
a
very
remarkable
personage
this
was
a
proper
subject
for
our
hero
to
moralise
upon
and
accordingly
it
did
not
pass
without
his
remarks
he
found
himself
fairly
foiled
at
his
own
weapons
reduced
to
indigence
in
a
foreign
land
and
what
he
chiefly
regretted
robbed
of
all
those
gay
expectations
he
had
indulged
from
his
own
supposed
excellence
in
the
wiles
of
fraud
for
upon
a
little
recollection
he
plainly
perceived
he
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
the
confederacy
he
had
refused
to
join
and
did
not
at
all
doubt
that
the
dice
were
loaded
for
his
destruction
but
instead
of
beating
his
head
against
the
wall
tearing
his
hair
imprecating
vain
curses
upon
himself
or
betraying
other
frantic
symptoms
of
despair
he
resolved
to
accommodate
himself
to
his
fate
and
profit
by
the
lesson
he
had
so
dearly
bought
with
this
intention
he
immediately
dismissed
his
valet
quitted
his
lodgings
retired
to
an
obscure
street
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
covering
one
eye
with
a
large
patch
of
black
silk
presented
himself
in
quality
of
a
musician
to
the
director
of
the
opera
who
upon
hearing
a
trial
of
his
skill
received
him
into
the
band
without
further
question
while
he
continued
in
this
situation
he
not
only
improved
his
taste
and
execution
in
music
but
likewise
found
frequent
opportunities
to
extend
his
knowledge
of
mankind
for
besides
the
employment
he
exercised
in
public
he
was
often
concerned
in
private
concerts
that
were
given
in
the
hotels
of
noblemen
by
which
means
he
became
more
and
more
acquainted
with
the
persons
manners
and
characters
of
high
life
which
he
contemplated
with
the
most
industrious
attention
as
a
spectator
who
being
altogether
unconcerned
in
the
performance
is
at
more
liberty
to
observe
and
enjoy
the
particulars
of
the
entertainment
it
was
in
one
of
those
assemblies
he
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
friend
sir
stentor
dressed
in
the
most
fashionable
manner
and
behaving
with
all
the
overstrained
politesse
of
a
native
frenchman
he
was
accompanied
by
his
brother
knight
and
the
abbe
and
this
triumvirate
even
in
fathom
hearing
gave
a
most
ludicrous
detail
of
the
finesse
they
had
practised
upon
the
polish
count
to
their
entertainer
who
was
ambassador
from
a
certain
court
and
made
himself
extremely
merry
with
the
particulars
of
the
relation
indeed
they
made
shift
to
describe
some
of
the
circumstances
in
such
a
ridiculous
light
that
our
adventurer
himself
smarting
as
he
was
with
the
disgrace
could
not
help
laughing
in
secret
at
the
account
he
afterwards
made
it
his
business
to
inquire
into
the
characters
of
the
two
british
knights
and
understood
they
were
notorious
sharpers
who
had
come
abroad
for
the
good
of
their
country
and
now
hunted
in
couple
among
a
french
pack
that
dispersed
themselves
through
the
public
ordinaries
walks
and
spectacles
in
order
to
make
a
prey
of
incautious
strangers
the
pride
of
ferdinand
was
piqued
at
this
information
and
he
was
even
animated
with
the
desire
of
making
reprisals
upon
this
fraternity
from
which
he
ardently
longed
to
retrieve
his
honour
and
effects
but
the
issue
of
his
last
adventure
had
reinforced
his
caution
and
for
the
present
he
found
means
to
suppress
the
dictates
of
his
avarice
and
ambition
resolving
to
employ
his
whole
penetration
in
reconnoitring
the
ground
before
he
should
venture
to
take
the
field
again
he
therefore
continued
to
act
the
part
of
a
fiddler
under
the
name
of
fadini
and
lived
with
incredible
frugality
that
he
might
save
a
purse
for
his
future
operations
in
this
manner
had
he
proceeded
for
the
space
of
ten
months
during
which
he
acquired
a
competent
knowledge
of
the
city
of
paris
when
his
curiosity
was
attracted
by
certain
peculiarities
in
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
lived
in
one
of
the
upper
apartments
belonging
to
the
house
in
which
he
himself
had
fixed
his
habitation
this
was
a
tall
thin
meagre
figure
with
a
long
black
beard
an
aquiline
nose
a
brown
complexion
and
a
most
piercing
vivacity
in
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
about
the
age
of
fifty
wore
the
persian
habit
and
there
was
a
remarkable
severity
in
his
aspect
and
demeanour
he
and
our
adventurer
had
been
for
some
time
and
according
to
the
laudable
custom
in
these
days
had
hitherto
remained
as
much
estranged
to
one
another
as
if
they
had
lived
on
opposite
sides
of
the
globe
but
of
late
the
persian
seemed
to
regard
our
hero
with
particular
attention
when
they
chanced
to
meet
on
the
staircase
or
elsewhere
he
bowed
to
ferdinand
with
great
solemnity
and
complimented
him
with
the
pas
he
even
proceeded
in
the
course
of
this
communication
to
open
his
mouth
and
salute
him
with
a
and
sometimes
made
the
common
remarks
upon
the
weather
fathom
who
was
naturally
complaisant
did
not
discourage
these
advances
on
the
contrary
he
behaved
to
him
with
marks
of
particular
respect
and
one
day
desired
the
favour
of
his
company
to
breakfast
this
invitation
the
stranger
declined
with
due
acknowledgment
on
pretence
of
being
out
of
order
and
in
the
meantime
our
adventurer
bethought
himself
of
questioning
the
landlord
concerning
his
outlandish
guest
his
curiosity
was
rather
inflamed
than
satisfied
with
the
information
he
could
obtain
from
this
quarter
for
all
he
learned
was
that
the
persian
went
by
the
name
of
ali
beker
and
that
he
had
lived
in
the
house
for
the
space
of
four
months
in
a
most
solitary
and
parsimonious
manner
without
being
visited
by
one
living
soul
that
for
some
time
after
his
arrival
he
had
been
often
heard
to
groan
dismally
in
the
night
and
even
to
exclaim
in
an
unknown
language
as
if
he
had
laboured
under
some
grievous
affliction
and
though
the
first
transports
of
his
grief
had
subsided
it
was
easy
to
perceive
he
still
indulged
a
melancholy
for
the
tears
were
frequently
observed
to
trickle
down
his
beard
the
commissaire
of
the
quarter
had
at
first
ordered
this
oriental
to
be
watched
in
his
outgoings
according
to
the
maxims
of
the
french
police
but
his
life
was
found
so
regular
and
inoffensive
that
this
precaution
was
soon
set
aside
any
man
of
humane
sentiments
from
the
knowledge
of
these
particulars
would
have
been
prompted
to
offer
his
services
to
the
forlorn
stranger
but
as
our
hero
was
devoid
of
all
these
infirmities
of
human
nature
it
was
necessary
that
other
motives
should
produce
the
same
effect
his
curiosity
therefore
joined
with
the
hopes
of
converting
the
confidence
of
ali
to
his
own
emolument
effectually
impelled
him
towards
his
acquaintance
and
in
a
little
time
they
began
to
relish
the
conversation
of
each
other
for
as
the
reader
may
have
already
observed
fathom
possessed
all
the
arts
of
insinuation
and
had
discernment
enough
to
perceive
an
air
of
dignity
in
the
persian
which
the
humility
of
his
circumstances
could
not
conceal
he
was
moreover
a
man
of
good
understanding
not
without
a
tincture
of
letters
perfectly
well
bred
though
in
a
ceremonious
style
extremely
moral
in
his
discourse
and
scrupulously
nice
in
his
notions
of
honour
our
hero
conformed
himself
in
all
respects
to
the
other
opinions
and
managed
his
discretion
so
as
to
pass
upon
him
for
a
gentleman
reduced
by
misfortunes
to
the
exercise
of
an
employment
which
was
altogether
unsuitable
to
his
birth
and
quality
he
made
earnest
and
repeated
tenders
of
his
good
offices
to
the
stranger
and
pressed
him
to
make
use
of
his
purse
with
such
cordial
perseverance
that
at
length
reserve
was
overcome
and
he
condescended
to
borrow
of
him
a
small
sum
which
in
all
probability
saved
his
life
for
he
had
been
driven
to
the
utmost
extremity
of
want
before
he
would
accept
of
this
assistance
fathom
having
gradually
stole
into
his
good
graces
began
to
take
notice
of
many
piteous
sighs
that
escaped
him
in
the
moments
of
their
intercourse
and
seemed
to
denote
an
heart
fraught
with
woe
and
on
pretence
of
administering
consolation
and
counsel
begged
leave
to
know
the
cause
of
his
distress
observing
that
his
mind
would
be
disburdened
by
such
communication
and
perhaps
his
grief
alleviated
by
some
means
which
they
might
jointly
concert
and
execute
in
his
behalf
ali
thus
solicited
would
often
shake
his
head
with
marks
of
extreme
sorrow
and
despondence
and
while
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
declared
that
his
distress
was
beyond
the
power
of
any
remedy
but
death
and
that
by
making
our
hero
his
confidant
he
should
only
extend
his
unhappiness
to
a
friend
without
feeling
the
least
remission
of
his
own
torture
notwithstanding
these
repeated
declarations
ferdinand
who
was
well
enough
acquainted
with
the
mind
of
man
to
know
that
such
importunity
is
seldom
or
never
disagreeable
redoubled
his
instances
together
with
his
expressions
of
sympathy
and
esteem
until
the
stranger
was
prevailed
upon
to
gratify
his
curiosity
and
benevolence
having
therefore
secured
the
chamber
door
one
night
while
all
the
rest
of
the
family
were
asleep
the
unfortunate
ali
disclosed
himself
in
these
words
chapter
the
history
of
the
noble
castilian
i
should
be
ungrateful
as
well
as
unwise
did
i
longer
resist
the
desire
you
express
to
know
the
particulars
of
that
destiny
which
hath
driven
me
to
this
miserable
disguise
and
rendered
me
in
all
considerations
the
most
wretched
of
men
i
have
felt
your
friendship
am
confident
of
your
honour
and
though
my
misfortunes
are
such
as
can
never
be
repaired
because
i
am
utterly
cut
off
from
hope
which
is
the
wretch
last
comfort
yet
i
may
by
your
means
be
enabled
to
bear
them
with
some
degree
of
fortitude
and
resignation
know
then
my
name
is
not
ali
neither
am
i
of
persian
extraction
i
had
once
the
honour
to
own
myself
a
castilian
and
was
under
the
appellation
of
don
diego
de
zelos
respected
as
the
head
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
families
of
that
kingdom
judge
then
how
severe
that
distress
must
be
which
compels
a
spaniard
to
renounce
his
country
his
honours
and
his
name
my
youth
was
not
spent
in
inglorious
ease
neither
did
it
waste
unheeded
in
the
rolls
of
fame
before
i
had
attained
the
age
of
nineteen
i
was
twice
wounded
in
battle
i
once
fortunately
recovered
the
standard
of
the
regiment
to
which
i
belonged
after
it
had
been
seized
by
the
enemy
and
at
another
occasion
made
shift
to
save
the
life
of
my
colonel
when
he
lay
at
the
mercy
of
an
enraged
barbarian
he
that
thinks
i
recapitulate
these
particulars
out
of
ostentation
does
wrong
to
the
unhappy
don
diego
de
zelos
who
in
having
performed
these
little
acts
of
gallantry
thinks
he
has
done
nothing
but
simply
approved
himself
worthy
of
being
called
a
castilian
i
mean
only
to
do
justice
to
my
own
character
and
to
make
you
acquainted
with
one
of
the
most
remarkable
incidents
of
my
life
it
was
my
fate
during
my
third
campaign
to
command
a
troop
of
horse
in
the
regiment
of
don
gonzales
orgullo
between
whom
and
my
father
a
family
feud
had
long
been
maintained
with
great
enmity
and
that
gentleman
did
not
leave
me
without
reason
to
believe
he
rejoiced
at
the
opportunity
of
exercising
his
resentment
upon
his
adversary
son
for
he
withheld
from
me
that
countenance
which
my
enjoyed
and
found
means
to
subject
me
to
divers
mortifications
of
which
i
was
not
at
liberty
to
complain
these
i
bore
in
silence
for
some
time
as
part
of
my
probation
in
the
character
of
a
soldier
resolved
nevertheless
to
employ
my
interest
at
court
for
a
removal
into
another
corps
and
to
take
some
future
opportunity
of
explaining
my
sentiments
to
don
gonzales
upon
the
injustice
of
his
behaviour
while
i
animated
myself
with
these
sentiments
against
the
discouragements
i
underwent
and
the
hard
duty
to
which
i
was
daily
exposed
it
was
our
fate
to
be
concerned
in
the
battle
of
saragossa
where
our
regiment
was
so
severely
handled
by
the
english
infantry
that
it
was
forced
to
give
ground
with
the
loss
of
one
half
of
its
officers
and
men
don
gonzales
who
acted
as
brigadier
in
another
wing
being
informed
of
our
fate
and
dreading
the
disgrace
of
his
corps
which
had
never
turned
back
to
the
enemy
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
riding
across
the
field
at
full
speed
rallied
our
broken
squadrons
and
led
us
back
to
the
charge
with
such
intrepidity
of
behaviour
as
did
not
fail
to
inspire
us
all
with
uncommon
courage
and
alacrity
for
my
own
part
i
thought
myself
doubly
interested
to
distinguish
my
valour
not
only
on
account
of
my
own
glory
but
likewise
on
the
supposition
that
as
i
was
acting
under
the
eye
of
gonzales
my
conduct
would
be
narrowly
observed
i
therefore
exerted
myself
with
unusual
vigour
and
as
he
began
the
attack
with
the
remains
of
my
troop
fought
close
by
his
side
during
the
rest
of
the
engagement
i
even
acquired
his
applause
in
the
very
heat
of
battle
when
his
hat
was
struck
off
and
his
horse
fell
under
him
i
accommodated
and
remounted
him
upon
my
own
and
having
seized
for
my
own
use
another
that
belonged
to
a
common
trooper
attended
this
stern
commander
as
before
and
seconded
him
in
all
his
repeated
efforts
but
it
was
impossible
to
withstand
the
numbers
and
impetuosity
of
the
foe
and
don
gonzales
having
had
the
mortification
to
see
his
regiment
cut
in
pieces
and
the
greatest
part
of
the
army
routed
was
fain
to
yield
to
the
fortune
of
the
day
yet
he
retired
as
became
a
man
of
honour
and
a
castilian
that
is
he
marched
off
with
great
deliberation
in
the
rear
of
the
spanish
troops
and
frequently
faced
about
to
check
the
pursuit
of
the
enemy
indeed
this
exercise
of
his
courage
had
cost
him
his
life
for
in
one
of
those
wheelings
he
was
left
almost
alone
and
a
small
party
of
the
portuguese
horse
had
actually
cut
off
our
communication
with
the
retreating
forces
of
spain
in
this
dilemma
we
had
no
other
chance
of
saving
our
lives
and
liberty
than
that
of
opening
a
passage
sword
in
hand
and
this
was
what
gonzales
instantly
resolved
to
attempt
we
accordingly
recommended
our
souls
to
god
and
charging
the
line
abreast
of
one
another
bore
down
all
opposition
and
were
in
a
fair
way
of
accomplishing
our
retreat
without
further
danger
but
the
gallant
orgullo
in
crossing
a
ditch
had
the
misfortune
to
be
thrown
from
his
horse
and
was
almost
the
same
instant
overtaken
by
one
of
the
portuguese
dragoons
whose
sword
was
already
suspended
over
his
head
as
he
lay
half
stunned
with
his
fall
when
i
rode
up
discharged
a
pistol
in
the
ruffian
brain
and
seating
my
colonel
on
his
horse
had
the
good
fortune
to
conduct
him
to
a
place
of
safety
here
he
was
provided
with
such
accommodation
as
his
case
required
for
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
battle
and
dangerously
bruised
by
his
fall
and
when
all
the
necessary
steps
were
taken
towards
his
recovery
i
desired
to
know
if
he
had
any
further
commands
for
his
service
being
resolved
to
join
the
army
without
delay
i
thought
proper
to
communicate
this
question
by
message
because
he
had
not
spoke
one
word
to
me
during
our
retreat
notwithstanding
the
good
office
he
had
received
at
my
hands
a
reserve
which
i
attributed
to
his
pride
and
resented
accordingly
he
no
sooner
understood
my
intention
than
he
desired
to
see
me
in
his
apartment
and
as
near
as
i
can
remember
spoke
to
this
effect
were
your
father
don
alonzo
alive
i
should
now
in
consequence
of
your
behaviour
banish
every
suggestion
of
resentment
and
solicit
his
friendship
with
great
sincerity
yes
don
diego
your
virtue
hath
triumphed
over
that
enmity
i
bore
your
house
and
i
upbraid
myself
with
the
ungenerous
treatment
you
have
suffered
under
my
command
but
it
is
not
enough
for
me
to
withdraw
that
rigour
which
it
was
unjust
to
exercise
and
would
be
wicked
to
maintain
i
must
likewise
atone
for
the
injuries
you
have
sustained
and
make
some
suitable
acknowledgment
for
that
life
which
i
have
twice
owed
to
your
valour
and
generosity
whatever
interest
i
have
at
court
shall
be
employed
in
your
behalf
and
i
have
other
designs
in
your
favour
which
shall
be
disclosed
in
due
season
meanwhile
i
desire
you
will
still
add
one
obligation
to
the
debt
which
i
have
already
incurred
and
carry
this
billet
in
person
to
my
estifania
who
from
the
news
of
this
fatal
overthrow
must
be
in
despair
upon
my
account
so
saying
he
presented
a
letter
directed
to
his
lady
which
i
received
in
a
transport
of
joy
with
expressions
suitable
to
the
occasion
and
immediately
set
out
for
his
country
house
which
happened
to
be
about
thirty
leagues
from
the
spot
this
expedition
was
equally
glorious
and
interesting
for
my
thoughts
upon
the
road
were
engrossed
by
the
hope
of
seeing
don
orgullo
daughter
and
heiress
antonia
who
was
reported
to
be
a
young
lady
of
great
beauty
and
the
most
amiable
accomplishments
however
ridiculous
it
may
seem
for
a
man
to
conceive
a
passion
for
an
object
which
he
hath
never
beheld
certain
it
is
my
sentiments
were
so
much
prepossessed
by
the
fame
of
her
qualifications
that
i
must
have
fallen
a
victim
to
her
charms
had
they
been
much
less
powerful
than
they
were
notwithstanding
the
fatigues
i
had
undergone
in
the
field
i
closed
not
an
eye
until
i
arrived
at
the
gate
of
gonzales
being
determined
to
precede
the
report
of
the
battle
that
madame
might
not
be
alarmed
for
the
life
of
her
husband
i
declared
my
errand
and
was
introduced
into
a
saloon
where
i
had
not
waited
above
three
minutes
when
my
colonel
lady
appeared
and
in
great
confusion
received
the
letter
exclaiming
heaven
grant
that
don
gonzales
be
well
in
reading
the
contents
she
underwent
a
variety
of
agitations
but
when
she
had
perused
the
whole
her
countenance
regained
its
serenity
and
regarding
me
with
an
air
of
ineffable
complacency
don
diego
said
she
while
i
lament
the
national
calamity
in
the
defeat
of
our
army
i
at
the
same
time
feel
the
most
sincere
pleasure
on
seeing
you
upon
this
occasion
and
according
to
the
directions
of
my
dear
lord
bid
you
heartily
welcome
to
this
house
as
his
preserver
and
friend
i
was
not
unacquainted
with
your
character
before
this
last
triumph
of
your
virtue
and
have
often
prayed
to
heaven
for
some
lucky
determination
of
that
fatal
quarrel
which
raged
so
long
between
the
family
of
gonzales
and
your
father
house
my
prayers
have
been
heard
the
reconciliation
is
now
effected
and
i
hope
nothing
will
ever
intervene
to
disturb
this
happy
union
to
this
polite
and
affectionate
declaration
i
made
such
a
reply
as
became
a
young
man
whose
heart
overflowed
with
joy
and
benevolence
and
desired
to
know
how
soon
her
answer
to
my
commander
would
be
ready
that
i
might
gratify
his
impatience
with
all
possible
despatch
after
having
thanked
me
for
this
fresh
proof
of
my
attachment
she
begged
i
would
retire
into
a
chamber
and
repose
myself
from
the
uncommon
fatigues
i
must
have
undergone
but
finding
i
persisted
in
the
resolution
of
returning
to
don
gonzales
without
allowing
myself
the
least
benefit
of
sleep
she
left
me
engaged
in
conversation
with
an
uncle
of
don
gonzales
who
lodged
in
the
house
and
gave
orders
that
a
collation
should
be
prepared
in
another
apartment
while
she
retired
to
her
closet
and
wrote
a
letter
to
her
husband
in
less
than
an
hour
from
my
first
arrival
i
was
introduced
into
a
most
elegant
where
a
magnificent
entertainment
was
served
up
and
where
we
were
joined
by
donna
estifania
and
her
beautiful
daughter
the
fair
antonia
who
advancing
with
the
most
amiable
sweetness
thanked
me
in
very
warm
expressions
of
acknowledgment
for
the
generosity
of
my
conduct
towards
her
father
i
had
been
ravished
with
her
first
appearance
which
far
exceeded
my
imagination
and
my
faculties
were
so
disordered
by
this
address
that
i
answered
her
compliment
with
the
most
awkward
confusion
but
this
disorder
did
not
turn
to
my
prejudice
in
the
opinion
of
that
lovely
creature
who
has
often
told
me
in
the
sequel
that
she
gave
herself
credit
for
that
perplexity
in
my
behaviour
and
that
i
never
appeared
more
worthy
of
her
regard
and
affection
than
at
that
juncture
when
my
dress
was
discomposed
and
my
whole
person
disfigured
by
the
toils
and
duty
of
the
preceding
day
for
this
very
dishabille
presented
itself
to
her
reflection
as
the
immediate
effect
of
that
very
merit
by
which
i
was
entitled
to
her
esteem
wretch
that
i
am
to
survive
the
loss
of
such
an
excellent
woman
endeared
to
my
remembrance
by
the
most
tender
offices
of
wedlock
happily
exercised
for
the
space
of
years
forgive
these
tears
they
are
not
the
drops
of
weakness
but
remorse
not
to
trouble
you
with
idle
particulars
suffice
it
is
to
say
i
was
favoured
with
such
marks
of
distinction
by
madame
that
she
thought
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
let
me
know
she
had
not
overacted
her
hospitality
and
while
we
sat
at
table
accosted
me
in
these
words
you
will
not
be
surprised
don
diego
at
my
expressions
of
regard
which
i
own
are
unusual
from
a
spanish
lady
to
a
young
cavalier
like
you
when
i
communicate
the
contents
of
this
letter
from
don
gonzales
so
saying
she
put
the
billet
into
my
hand
and
i
read
these
words
or
words
to
this
effect
amiable
estifania
you
will
understand
that
i
am
as
well
as
a
person
can
possibly
be
who
hath
this
day
lived
to
see
the
army
of
his
king
defeated
if
you
would
know
the
particulars
of
this
unfortunate
action
your
curiosity
will
be
gratified
by
the
bearer
don
diego
de
zelos
to
whose
virtue
and
bravery
i
am
twice
indebted
for
my
life
i
therefore
desire
you
will
receive
him
with
that
respect
and
gratitude
which
you
shall
think
due
for
such
an
obligation
and
in
entertaining
him
dismiss
that
reserve
which
often
disgraces
the
spanish
hospitality
in
a
word
let
your
own
virtue
and
beneficence
conduct
you
upon
this
occasion
and
let
my
antonia
endeavours
be
joined
with
your
own
in
doing
honour
to
the
preserver
of
her
father
adieu
such
a
testimonial
could
not
fail
of
being
very
agreeable
to
a
young
soldier
who
by
this
time
had
begun
to
indulge
the
transporting
hope
of
being
happy
in
the
arms
of
the
adorable
antonia
i
professed
myself
extremely
happy
in
having
met
with
an
opportunity
of
acquiring
such
a
degree
of
my
colonel
esteem
entertained
them
with
a
detail
of
his
personal
prowess
in
the
battle
and
answered
all
their
questions
with
that
moderation
which
every
man
ought
to
preserve
in
speaking
of
his
own
behaviour
our
repast
being
ended
i
took
my
leave
of
the
ladies
and
at
parting
received
a
letter
from
donna
estifania
to
her
husband
together
with
a
ring
of
great
value
which
she
begged
i
would
accept
as
a
token
of
her
esteem
thus
loaded
with
honour
and
caresses
i
set
out
on
my
return
for
the
quarters
of
don
gonzales
who
could
scarce
credit
his
own
eyes
when
i
delivered
his
lady
billet
for
he
thought
it
impossible
to
perform
such
a
journey
in
so
short
a
time
when
he
had
glanced
over
the
paper
don
diego
said
he
by
your
short
stay
one
would
imagine
you
had
met
with
indifferent
reception
at
my
house
i
hope
estifania
has
not
been
deficient
in
her
duty
i
answered
this
question
by
assuring
him
my
entertainment
had
been
so
agreeable
in
all
respects
that
nothing
but
my
duty
to
him
could
have
induced
me
to
give
it
up
so
soon
he
then
turned
the
conversation
upon
antonia
and
hinted
his
intention
of
giving
her
in
marriage
to
a
young
cavalier
for
whom
he
had
a
particular
friendship
i
was
so
much
affected
by
this
insinuation
which
seemed
at
once
to
blast
all
my
hopes
of
love
and
happiness
that
the
blood
forsook
my
face
i
was
seized
with
an
universal
trepidation
and
even
obliged
to
retire
on
pretence
of
being
suddenly
taken
ill
though
gonzales
seemed
to
impute
this
disorder
to
fatigue
and
want
of
rest
he
in
his
heart
ascribed
it
to
the
true
cause
and
after
having
sounded
my
sentiments
to
his
own
satisfaction
blessed
me
with
a
declaration
importing
that
i
was
the
person
upon
whom
he
had
pitched
for
a
i
will
not
trouble
you
with
a
repetition
of
what
passed
on
this
interesting
occasion
but
proceed
to
observe
that
his
intention
in
my
favour
was
far
from
being
disagreeable
to
his
lady
and
that
in
a
little
time
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
espouse
the
charming
antonia
who
submitted
to
the
will
of
her
father
without
reluctance
soon
after
this
happy
event
i
was
by
the
influence
of
don
gonzales
joined
to
my
own
interest
promoted
to
the
command
of
a
regiment
and
served
with
honour
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
war
after
the
treaty
of
utrecht
i
was
employed
in
reducing
the
catalans
to
their
allegiance
and
in
an
action
with
those
obstinate
rebels
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
my
who
by
that
time
was
preferred
to
the
rank
of
a
the
virtuous
estifania
did
not
long
survive
this
melancholy
accident
and
the
loss
of
these
indulgent
parents
made
such
a
deep
impression
upon
the
tender
heart
of
my
antonia
that
i
took
the
first
opportunity
of
removing
her
from
a
place
in
which
every
object
served
to
cherish
her
grief
to
a
pleasant
villa
near
the
city
of
seville
which
i
purchased
on
account
of
its
agreeable
situation
that
i
might
the
more
perfectly
enjoy
the
possession
of
my
amiable
partner
who
could
no
longer
brook
the
thoughts
of
another
separation
peace
was
no
sooner
than
i
obtained
leave
to
resign
my
commission
and
i
wholly
devoted
myself
to
the
joys
of
a
domestic
life
heaven
seemed
to
smile
upon
our
union
by
blessing
us
with
a
son
whom
however
it
was
pleased
to
recall
in
his
infancy
to
our
unspeakable
grief
and
mortification
but
our
mutual
chagrin
was
afterwards
alleviated
by
the
birth
of
a
daughter
who
seemed
born
with
every
accomplishment
to
excite
the
love
and
admiration
of
mankind
why
did
nature
debase
such
a
masterpiece
with
the
mixture
of
an
alloy
which
hath
involved
herself
and
her
whole
family
in
perdition
but
the
ways
of
providence
are
unsearchable
she
hath
paid
the
debt
of
her
degeneracy
peace
be
with
her
soul
the
honour
of
my
family
is
vindicated
though
by
a
sacrifice
which
hath
robbed
me
of
everything
else
that
is
valuable
in
life
and
ruined
my
peace
past
all
redemption
yes
my
friend
all
the
tortures
that
human
tyranny
can
inflict
would
be
ease
tranquillity
and
delight
to
the
unspeakable
pangs
and
horrors
i
have
felt
but
to
return
from
this
serafina
which
was
the
name
of
that
little
darling
as
she
grew
up
not
only
disclosed
all
the
natural
graces
of
external
beauty
but
likewise
manifested
the
most
engaging
sweetness
of
disposition
and
a
capacity
for
acquiring
with
ease
all
the
accomplishments
of
her
sex
it
is
impossible
to
convey
any
adequate
idea
of
a
parent
raptures
in
the
contemplation
of
such
a
fair
blossom
she
was
the
only
pledge
of
our
love
she
was
presumptive
heiress
to
a
large
fortune
and
likely
to
be
the
sole
representative
of
two
noble
castilian
families
she
was
the
delight
of
all
who
saw
her
and
a
theme
of
praise
for
every
tongue
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
the
education
of
such
a
child
was
neglected
indeed
it
wholly
engrossed
the
attention
of
me
and
my
antonia
and
her
proficiency
rewarded
our
care
before
she
had
attained
the
age
of
fifteen
she
was
mistress
of
every
elegant
qualification
natural
and
acquired
her
person
was
by
that
time
the
confessed
pattern
of
beauty
her
voice
was
enchantingly
sweet
and
she
touched
the
lute
with
the
most
ravishing
dexterity
heaven
and
earth
how
did
my
breast
dilate
with
joy
at
the
thoughts
of
having
given
birth
to
such
perfection
how
did
my
heart
gush
with
paternal
fondness
whenever
i
beheld
this
ornament
of
my
name
and
what
scenes
of
endearing
transport
have
i
enjoyed
with
my
antonia
in
mutual
congratulation
upon
our
parental
happiness
serafina
accomplished
as
she
was
could
not
fail
to
make
conquests
among
the
spanish
cavaliers
who
are
famous
for
sensibility
in
love
indeed
she
never
appeared
without
a
numerous
train
of
admirers
and
though
we
had
bred
her
up
in
that
freedom
of
conversation
and
intercourse
which
holds
a
middle
space
between
the
french
licence
and
spanish
restraint
she
was
now
so
much
exposed
to
the
addresses
of
promiscuous
gallantry
that
we
found
it
necessary
to
retrench
the
liberty
of
our
house
and
behave
to
our
male
visitants
with
great
reserve
and
circumspection
that
our
honour
and
peace
might
run
no
risk
from
the
youth
and
inexperience
of
our
daughter
this
caution
produced
overtures
from
a
great
many
young
gentlemen
of
rank
and
distinction
who
courted
my
alliance
by
demanding
serafina
in
marriage
and
from
the
number
i
had
actually
selected
one
person
who
was
in
all
respects
worthy
the
possession
of
such
an
inestimable
prize
his
name
was
don
manuel
de
mendoza
his
birth
was
noble
and
his
character
dignified
with
repeated
acts
of
generosity
and
virtue
yet
before
i
would
signify
to
him
my
approbation
of
his
suit
i
resolved
to
inform
myself
whether
or
not
the
heart
of
serafina
was
totally
unengaged
and
indifferent
to
any
other
object
that
i
might
not
lay
a
tyrannical
restraint
upon
her
inclinations
the
result
of
my
inquiry
was
a
full
conviction
of
her
having
hitherto
been
deaf
to
the
voice
of
love
and
this
piece
of
information
together
with
my
own
sentiments
in
his
favour
i
communicated
to
don
manuel
who
heard
these
tidings
with
transports
of
gratitude
and
joy
he
was
immediately
favoured
with
opportunities
of
acquiring
the
affection
of
my
daughter
and
his
endeavours
were
at
first
received
with
such
respectful
civility
as
might
have
been
easily
warmed
into
a
mutual
passion
had
not
the
evil
genius
of
our
family
interposed
o
my
friend
how
shall
i
describe
the
depravity
of
that
unhappy
sentiments
how
recount
the
particulars
of
my
own
dishonour
i
that
am
descended
from
a
long
line
of
illustrious
castilians
who
never
received
an
injury
they
did
not
revenge
but
washed
away
every
blemish
in
their
fame
with
the
blood
of
those
who
attempted
to
stain
it
in
that
circumstance
i
have
imitated
the
example
of
my
glorious
progenitors
and
that
consideration
alone
hath
supported
me
against
all
the
assaults
of
despair
as
i
grudged
no
pains
and
expense
in
perfecting
the
education
of
serafina
my
doors
were
open
to
every
person
who
made
an
extraordinary
figure
in
the
profession
of
those
amusing
sciences
in
which
she
delighted
the
house
of
don
diego
de
zelos
was
a
little
academy
for
painting
poetry
and
music
and
heaven
decreed
that
it
should
fall
a
sacrifice
to
its
regard
for
these
fatal
and
delusive
arts
among
other
preceptors
it
was
her
fate
to
be
under
the
instruction
of
a
cursed
german
who
though
his
profession
was
drawing
understood
the
elements
and
theory
of
music
possessed
a
large
fund
of
learning
and
taste
and
was
a
person
remarkable
for
his
agreeable
conversation
this
traitor
who
like
you
had
lost
one
eye
i
not
only
admitted
into
my
house
for
the
improvement
of
my
daughter
but
even
distinguished
with
particular
marks
of
confidence
and
favour
little
thinking
he
had
either
inclination
or
capacity
to
debauch
the
sentiments
of
my
child
i
was
rejoiced
beyond
measure
to
see
with
what
alacrity
she
received
his
lessons
with
what
avidity
she
listened
to
his
discourse
which
was
always
equally
moral
instructing
and
entertaining
antonia
seemed
to
vie
with
me
in
expressions
of
regard
for
this
accomplished
stranger
whom
she
could
not
help
supposing
to
be
a
person
of
rank
and
family
reduced
to
his
present
situation
by
some
unfortunate
vicissitude
of
fate
i
was
disposed
to
concur
with
this
opinion
and
actually
conjured
him
to
make
me
his
confidant
with
such
protestations
as
left
him
no
room
to
doubt
my
honour
and
beneficence
but
he
still
persisted
in
declaring
himself
the
son
of
an
obscure
mechanic
in
bohemia
an
origin
to
which
surely
no
man
would
pretend
who
had
the
least
claim
to
nobility
of
birth
while
i
was
thus
undeceived
in
my
conjecture
touching
his
birth
and
quality
i
was
confirmed
in
an
opinion
of
his
integrity
and
moderation
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
man
of
honour
in
despite
of
the
lowness
of
his
pedigree
nevertheless
he
was
at
bottom
a
most
perfidious
wretch
and
all
this
modesty
and
were
the
effects
of
the
most
villanous
dissimulation
a
cloak
under
which
he
unsuspected
robbed
me
of
my
honour
and
my
peace
not
to
trouble
you
with
particulars
the
recital
of
which
would
tear
my
with
indignation
and
remorse
i
shall
only
observe
that
by
the
power
of
his
infernal
insinuation
he
fascinated
the
heart
of
serafina
brought
over
antonia
herself
to
the
interests
of
his
passion
and
at
once
detached
them
both
from
their
duty
and
religion
heaven
and
earth
how
dangerous
how
irresistible
is
the
power
of
infatuation
while
i
remained
in
the
midst
of
this
blind
security
waiting
for
the
nuptials
of
my
daughter
and
indulging
myself
with
the
vain
prospect
of
her
approaching
felicity
antonia
found
means
to
protract
the
negotiations
of
the
marriage
by
representing
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
deprive
serafina
of
the
opportunity
she
then
had
of
profiting
by
the
german
instructions
and
upon
that
account
i
prevailed
upon
don
manuel
to
bridle
the
impatience
of
his
love
during
this
interval
as
i
one
evening
enjoyed
the
cool
air
in
my
own
garden
i
was
accosted
by
an
old
duenna
who
had
been
my
nurse
and
lived
in
the
family
since
the
time
of
my
my
duty
said
she
will
no
longer
permit
me
to
wink
in
silence
at
the
wrongs
i
see
you
daily
suffer
dismiss
that
german
from
your
house
without
delay
if
you
respect
the
glory
of
your
name
and
the
rights
of
our
holy
religion
the
stranger
is
an
abominable
heretic
and
grant
heaven
he
may
not
have
already
poisoned
the
minds
of
those
you
hold
most
dear
i
had
been
extremely
alarmed
at
the
beginning
of
this
address
but
finding
the
imputation
limited
to
the
article
of
religion
in
which
thank
god
i
am
no
bigot
i
recovered
my
serenity
of
disposition
thanked
the
old
woman
for
her
zeal
commended
her
piety
and
encouraged
her
to
persevere
in
making
observations
on
such
subjects
as
should
concern
my
honour
and
my
quiet
we
live
in
such
a
world
of
wickedness
and
fraud
that
a
man
can
not
be
too
vigilant
in
his
own
defence
had
i
employed
such
spies
from
the
beginning
i
should
in
all
probability
have
been
at
this
day
in
possession
of
every
comfort
that
renders
life
agreeable
the
duenna
thus
authorised
employed
her
sagacity
with
such
success
that
i
had
reason
to
suspect
the
german
of
a
design
upon
the
heart
of
serafina
but
as
the
presumptions
did
not
amount
to
conviction
i
contented
myself
with
exiling
him
from
my
house
under
the
pretext
of
having
discovered
that
he
was
an
enemy
to
the
catholic
church
and
forthwith
appointed
a
day
for
the
celebration
of
my
daughter
marriage
with
don
manuel
de
mendoza
i
could
easily
perceive
a
cloud
of
melancholy
overspread
the
faces
of
serafina
and
her
mother
when
i
declared
these
my
resolutions
but
as
they
made
no
objection
to
what
i
proposed
i
did
not
at
that
time
enter
into
an
explanation
of
the
true
motives
that
influenced
my
conduct
both
parties
were
probably
afraid
of
such
expostulation
meanwhile
preparations
were
made
for
the
espousals
of
serafina
and
notwithstanding
the
anxiety
i
had
undergone
on
account
of
her
connexion
with
the
german
i
began
to
think
that
her
duty
her
glory
had
triumphed
over
all
such
considerations
if
ever
they
had
been
entertained
because
she
and
even
antonia
seemed
to
expect
the
ceremony
with
resignation
though
the
features
of
both
still
retained
evident
marks
of
concern
which
i
willingly
imputed
to
the
mutual
prospect
of
their
separation
this
however
was
but
a
faithless
calm
that
soon
ah
too
soon
brought
forth
a
tempest
which
hath
wrecked
my
hopes
two
days
before
the
appointed
union
of
don
manuel
and
serafina
i
was
informed
by
the
duenna
that
while
she
accompanied
at
church
she
had
seen
her
receive
a
billet
from
an
old
woman
who
kneeling
at
her
side
had
conveyed
it
in
such
a
mysterious
manner
as
awakened
the
duenna
apprehensions
about
her
young
lady
she
had
therefore
hastened
home
to
communicate
this
piece
of
intelligence
that
i
might
have
an
opportunity
of
examining
the
messenger
before
she
could
have
time
to
deposit
her
trust
i
could
not
help
shivering
with
fearful
presages
upon
this
occasion
and
even
abhorring
the
person
to
whose
duty
and
zeal
i
was
beholden
for
the
intelligence
even
while
i
endeavoured
to
persuade
myself
that
the
inquiry
would
end
in
the
detection
of
some
paltry
intrigue
between
the
maid
and
her
own
gallant
i
intercepted
her
in
returning
from
church
and
commanding
her
to
follow
me
to
a
convenient
place
extorted
from
her
by
dint
of
threats
the
fatal
letter
which
i
read
to
this
effect
the
whole
business
of
my
life
o
divine
serafina
will
be
to
repay
that
affection
i
have
been
so
happy
as
to
engage
with
what
transport
then
shall
i
obey
your
summons
in
performing
that
enterprise
which
will
rescue
you
from
the
bed
of
a
detested
rival
and
put
myself
in
full
possession
of
a
jewel
which
i
value
infinitely
more
than
life
yes
adorable
creature
i
have
provided
everything
for
our
escape
and
at
midnight
will
attend
you
in
your
own
apartment
from
whence
you
shall
be
conveyed
into
a
land
of
liberty
and
peace
where
you
will
unmolested
enjoy
the
purity
of
that
religion
you
have
espoused
and
in
full
security
bless
the
arms
of
your
ever
faithful
orlando
were
you
a
fond
parent
a
tender
husband
and
a
noble
castilian
i
should
not
need
to
mention
the
unutterable
horrors
that
took
possession
of
my
bosom
when
i
perused
this
accursed
letter
by
which
i
learned
the
apostasy
disobedience
and
degeneracy
of
my
idolised
serafina
who
had
overthrown
and
destroyed
the
whole
plan
of
felicity
which
i
had
erected
and
blasted
all
the
glories
of
my
name
and
when
the
wretched
messenger
terrified
by
my
menaces
and
agitation
confessed
that
antonia
herself
was
privy
to
the
guilt
of
her
daughter
whom
she
had
solemnly
betrothed
to
that
vile
german
in
the
sight
of
heaven
and
that
by
her
connivance
this
plebeian
intended
that
very
night
to
bereave
me
of
my
child
i
was
for
some
moments
stupefied
with
grief
and
amazement
that
gave
way
to
an
ecstasy
of
rage
which
had
terminated
in
despair
and
distraction
i
now
tremble
and
my
head
grows
giddy
with
the
remembrance
of
that
dreadful
occasion
behold
how
the
drops
trickle
down
my
forehead
this
agony
is
a
fierce
and
familiar
visitant
i
shall
banish
it
anon
i
summoned
my
pride
my
resentment
to
my
assistance
these
are
the
cordials
that
support
me
against
all
other
reflections
those
were
the
auxiliaries
that
enabled
me
in
the
day
of
trial
to
perform
that
sacrifice
which
my
honour
demanded
in
a
strain
so
loud
as
to
drown
the
cries
of
nature
love
and
compassion
yes
they
espoused
that
glory
which
humanity
would
have
betrayed
and
my
revenge
was
noble
though
unnatural
my
scheme
was
soon
laid
my
resolution
soon
taken
i
privately
confined
the
wretch
who
had
been
the
industrious
slave
of
this
infamous
conspiracy
that
she
might
take
no
step
to
frustrate
or
interrupt
the
execution
of
my
design
then
repairing
to
the
house
of
an
apothecary
who
was
devoted
to
my
service
communicated
my
intention
which
he
durst
not
condemn
and
could
not
reveal
without
breaking
the
oath
of
secrecy
i
had
imposed
and
he
furnished
me
with
two
vials
of
poison
for
the
dismal
catastrophe
i
had
planned
thus
provided
i
on
pretence
of
sudden
business
at
seville
carefully
avoided
the
dear
the
wretched
pair
whom
i
had
devoted
to
death
that
my
heart
might
not
relent
by
means
of
those
tender
ideas
which
the
sight
of
them
would
have
infallibly
inspired
and
when
daylight
vanished
took
my
station
near
that
part
of
the
house
through
which
the
villain
must
have
entered
on
his
hellish
purpose
there
i
stood
in
a
state
of
horrid
expectation
my
soul
ravaged
with
the
different
passions
that
assailed
it
until
the
fatal
moment
arrived
when
i
perceived
the
traitor
approach
the
window
of
a
lower
apartment
which
led
into
that
of
serafina
and
gently
lifting
the
casement
which
was
purposely
left
unsecured
insinuated
half
of
his
body
into
the
house
then
rushing
upon
him
in
a
transport
of
fury
i
plunged
my
sword
into
his
heart
crying
villain
receive
the
reward
of
thy
treachery
and
presumption
the
steel
was
so
well
aimed
as
to
render
a
repetition
of
the
stroke
unnecessary
he
uttered
one
groan
and
fell
breathless
at
my
feet
exulting
with
this
first
success
of
my
revenge
i
penetrated
into
the
chamber
where
the
robber
of
my
peace
was
expected
by
the
unhappy
serafina
and
her
mother
who
seeing
me
enter
with
a
most
savage
aspect
and
a
sword
reeking
with
the
vengeance
i
had
taken
seemed
almost
petrified
with
fear
behold
said
i
the
blood
of
that
base
plebeian
who
made
an
attempt
upon
the
honour
of
my
house
your
conspiracy
against
the
unfortunate
don
diego
de
zelos
is
now
discovered
that
presumptuous
slave
the
favoured
orlando
is
now
no
more
scarce
had
i
pronounced
these
words
when
a
loud
scream
was
uttered
by
both
the
unhappy
victims
if
orlando
is
slain
cried
the
infatuated
serafina
what
have
i
to
do
with
life
o
my
dear
lord
my
husband
and
my
lover
how
are
our
promised
joys
at
once
cut
off
here
strike
my
father
complete
your
barbarous
sacrifice
the
spirit
of
the
murdered
orlando
still
hovers
for
his
wife
these
frantic
exclamations
in
which
she
was
joined
by
antonia
kept
up
the
fury
of
my
resentment
which
by
meekness
and
submission
might
have
been
weakened
and
rendered
ineffectual
yes
hapless
wretches
i
replied
ye
shall
enjoy
your
wish
the
honour
of
my
name
requires
that
both
shall
die
yet
i
will
not
mangle
the
breast
of
antonia
on
which
i
have
so
often
reposed
i
will
not
shed
the
blood
of
zelos
nor
disfigure
the
beauteous
form
of
serafina
on
which
i
have
so
often
gazed
with
wonder
and
unspeakable
delight
here
is
an
elixir
to
which
i
trust
the
consummation
of
my
revenge
so
saying
i
emptied
the
vials
into
separate
cups
and
presenting
one
in
each
hand
the
miserable
the
fair
offenders
instantly
received
the
destined
draughts
which
they
drank
without
hesitation
then
praying
to
heaven
for
the
wretched
don
diego
sunk
upon
the
same
couch
and
expired
without
a
groan
o
beverage
o
happy
composition
by
which
all
the
miseries
of
life
are
so
easily
cured
such
was
the
fate
of
antonia
and
serafina
these
hands
were
the
instruments
that
deprived
them
of
life
these
eyes
beheld
them
the
richest
prize
that
death
had
ever
won
powers
supreme
does
don
diego
live
to
make
this
recapitulation
i
have
done
my
duty
but
ah
i
am
haunted
by
the
furies
of
remorse
i
am
tortured
with
the
incessant
stings
of
remembrance
and
regret
even
now
the
images
of
my
wife
and
daughter
present
themselves
to
my
imagination
all
the
scenes
of
happiness
i
have
enjoyed
as
a
lover
husband
and
parent
all
the
endearing
hopes
i
have
cherished
now
pass
in
review
before
me
embittering
the
circumstances
of
my
inexpressible
woe
and
i
consider
myself
as
a
solitary
outcast
from
all
the
comforts
of
society
but
enough
of
these
unmanly
complaints
the
yearnings
of
nature
are
too
importunate
having
completed
my
vengeance
i
retired
into
my
closet
and
furnishing
myself
with
some
ready
money
and
jewels
of
considerable
value
went
into
the
stable
saddled
my
favourite
steed
which
i
instantly
mounted
and
before
the
tumults
of
my
breast
subsided
found
myself
at
the
town
of
lucar
there
i
learned
from
inquiry
that
there
was
a
dutch
bark
in
the
harbour
ready
to
sail
upon
which
i
addressed
myself
to
the
master
who
for
a
suitable
gratification
was
prevailed
upon
to
weigh
anchor
that
same
night
so
that
embarking
without
delay
i
soon
bid
eternal
adieu
to
my
native
country
it
was
not
from
reason
and
reflection
that
i
took
these
measures
for
my
personal
safety
but
in
consequence
of
an
involuntary
instinct
that
seems
to
operate
in
the
animal
machine
while
the
faculty
of
thinking
is
suspended
to
what
a
dreadful
reckoning
was
i
called
when
reason
resumed
her
function
you
may
believe
me
my
friend
when
i
assure
you
that
i
should
not
have
outlived
those
tragedies
i
acted
had
i
not
been
restrained
from
doing
violence
upon
myself
by
certain
considerations
which
no
man
of
honour
ought
to
set
aside
i
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
falling
ingloriously
by
the
hand
of
an
executioner
and
entailing
disgrace
upon
a
family
that
knew
no
stain
and
i
was
deterred
from
putting
an
end
to
my
own
misery
by
the
apprehension
of
posthumous
censure
which
would
have
represented
me
as
a
desponding
wretch
utterly
destitute
of
that
patience
fortitude
and
resignation
which
are
the
characteristics
of
a
true
castilian
i
was
also
influenced
by
religious
motives
that
suggested
to
me
the
necessity
of
living
to
atone
by
my
sufferings
and
sorrow
for
the
guilt
i
had
incurred
in
complying
with
a
savage
punctilio
which
is
i
fear
displeasing
in
the
sight
of
heaven
these
were
the
reasons
that
opposed
my
entrance
into
that
peaceful
harbour
which
death
presented
to
my
view
and
they
were
soon
reinforced
by
another
principle
that
sanctioned
my
determination
to
continue
at
the
servile
oar
of
life
in
consequence
of
unfavourable
winds
our
vessel
for
some
days
made
small
progress
in
her
voyage
to
holland
and
near
the
coast
of
gallicia
we
were
joined
by
an
english
ship
from
vigo
the
master
of
which
gave
us
to
understand
that
before
he
set
sail
a
courier
had
arrived
from
madrid
at
that
place
with
orders
for
the
corregidore
to
prevent
the
escape
of
any
native
spaniard
by
sea
from
any
port
within
his
district
and
to
use
his
utmost
endeavours
to
apprehend
the
person
of
don
diego
de
zelos
who
was
suspected
of
treasonable
practices
against
the
state
such
an
order
with
a
minute
description
of
my
person
was
at
the
same
time
despatched
to
all
the
seaports
and
frontier
places
in
spain
you
may
easily
suppose
how
i
who
was
already
overwhelmed
with
distress
could
bear
this
aggravation
of
misfortune
and
disgrace
i
who
had
always
maintained
the
reputation
of
loyalty
which
was
acquired
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
and
the
expense
of
my
blood
to
deal
candidly
i
must
own
that
this
intelligence
roused
me
from
a
lethargy
of
grief
which
had
begun
to
overpower
my
faculties
i
immediately
imputed
this
dishonourable
charge
to
the
evil
offices
of
some
villain
who
had
basely
taken
the
advantage
of
my
deplorable
situation
and
i
was
inflamed
inspirited
with
the
desire
of
vindicating
my
fame
and
revenging
the
injury
thus
animated
i
resolved
to
disguise
myself
effectually
from
the
observation
of
those
spies
which
every
nation
finds
its
account
in
employing
in
foreign
countries
i
purchased
this
habit
from
the
dutch
navigator
in
whose
house
i
kept
myself
concealed
after
our
arrival
at
amsterdam
until
my
beard
was
grown
to
a
sufficient
length
to
favour
my
design
and
then
appeared
as
a
persian
dealer
in
jewels
as
i
could
gain
no
satisfactory
information
touching
myself
in
this
country
had
no
purpose
to
pursue
and
was
extremely
miserable
among
a
people
who
being
mercenary
and
unsocial
were
very
ill
adapted
to
alleviate
the
horrors
of
my
condition
i
gratified
my
landlord
for
his
important
services
with
the
best
part
of
my
effects
and
having
by
his
means
procured
a
certificate
from
the
magistracy
repaired
to
rotterdam
from
whence
i
set
out
in
a
travelling
carriage
for
antwerp
on
my
way
to
this
capital
hoping
with
a
succession
of
different
objects
to
mitigate
the
anguish
of
my
mind
and
by
the
most
industrious
inquiry
to
learn
such
particulars
of
that
false
impeachment
as
would
enable
me
to
take
measures
for
my
own
justification
as
well
as
for
projecting
a
plan
of
revenge
against
the
vile
perfidious
author
this
i
imagined
would
be
no
difficult
task
considering
the
friendship
and
intercourse
subsisting
between
the
spanish
and
french
nations
and
the
communicative
disposition
for
which
the
parisians
are
renowned
but
i
have
found
myself
egregiously
deceived
in
my
expectation
the
officers
of
police
in
this
city
are
so
inquisitive
and
vigilant
that
the
most
minute
action
of
a
stranger
is
scrutinised
with
great
severity
and
although
the
inhabitants
are
very
frank
in
discoursing
on
indifferent
subjects
they
are
at
the
same
time
extremely
cautious
in
avoiding
all
conversation
that
turns
upon
state
occurrences
and
maxims
of
government
in
a
word
the
peculiarity
of
my
appearance
subjects
me
so
much
to
particular
observation
that
i
have
hitherto
thought
proper
to
devour
my
griefs
in
silence
and
even
to
bear
the
want
of
almost
every
convenience
rather
than
hazard
a
premature
discovery
by
offering
my
jewels
to
sale
in
this
emergency
i
have
been
so
far
fortunate
as
to
become
acquainted
with
you
whom
i
look
upon
as
a
man
of
honour
and
humanity
indeed
i
was
at
first
sight
prepossessed
in
your
favour
for
notwithstanding
the
mistakes
which
men
daily
commit
in
judging
from
appearances
there
is
something
in
the
physiognomy
of
a
stranger
from
which
one
can
not
help
forming
an
opinion
of
his
character
and
disposition
for
once
my
penetration
hath
not
failed
me
your
behaviour
justifies
my
decision
you
have
treated
me
with
that
sympathy
and
respect
which
none
but
the
generous
will
pay
to
the
unfortunate
i
have
trusted
you
accordingly
i
have
put
my
life
my
honour
in
your
power
and
i
must
beg
leave
to
depend
upon
your
friendship
for
obtaining
that
satisfaction
for
which
alone
i
seek
to
live
your
employment
engages
you
in
the
gay
world
you
daily
mingle
with
the
societies
of
men
the
domestics
of
the
spanish
ambassador
will
not
shun
your
acquaintance
you
may
frequent
the
to
which
they
resort
and
in
the
course
of
these
occasions
unsuspected
inform
yourself
of
that
mysterious
charge
which
lies
heavy
on
the
fame
of
the
unfortunate
don
diego
i
must
likewise
implore
your
assistance
in
converting
my
jewels
into
money
that
i
may
breathe
independent
of
man
until
heaven
shall
permit
me
to
finish
this
weary
pilgrimage
of
life
chapter
a
flagrant
instance
of

virtue
in

manner

retreat

who
had
lent
an
attentive
ear
to
every
circumstance

this
disastrous
story
no

heard

than
with
an
aspect

generous
and
cordial
compassion

unattended
with
tears

drew
a
flood
from
his
eyes
while
he
wrung
his
benefactor
hand
in
a
transport
of
gratitude
those
were
literally
tears
of
joy
or
at
least
of
satisfaction
on
both
sides
as
our
hero
wept
with
affection
and
attachment
to
the
jewels
that
were
to
be
committed
to
his
care
but
far
from
discovering
the
true
source
of
his
tenderness
he
affected
to
dissuade
the
spaniard
from
parting
with
the
diamonds
which
he
counselled
him
to
reserve
for
a
more
pressing
occasion
and
in
the
meantime
earnestly
entreated
him
to
depend
upon
his
friendship
for
present
relief
this
generous
proffer
served
only
to
confirm
don
diego
resolution
which
he
forthwith
executed
by
putting
into
the
hands
of
ferdinand
jewels
to
the
value
of
a
thousand
crowns
and
desiring
him
to
detain
for
his
own
use
any
part
of
the
sum
they
would
raise
our
adventurer
thanked
him
for
the
good
opinion
he
entertained
of
his
integrity
an
opinion
fully
manifested
in
honouring
him
with
such
important
confidence
and
assured
him
he
would
transact
his
affairs
with
the
utmost
diligence
caution
and
despatch
the
evening
being
by
this
time
almost
consumed
these
new
allies
retired
separately
to
rest
though
each
passed
the
night
without
repose
in
very
different
reflections
the
castilian
being
as
usual
agitated
with
the
unceasing
pangs
of
his
unalterable
misery
interspersed
with
gleaming
hopes
of
revenge
and
fathom
being
kept
awake
with
revolving
plans
for
turning
his
credulity
to
his
own
advantage
from
the
nature
of
the
spaniard
situation
he
might
have
appropriated
the
jewels
to
himself
and
remained
in
paris
without
fear
of
a
prosecution
because
the
injured
party
had
by
the
above
narrative
left
his
life
and
liberty
at
but
he
did
not
think
himself
secure
from
the
personal
resentment
of
an
enraged
desperate
castilian
and
therefore
determined
to
withdraw
himself
privately
into
that
country
where
he
had
all
along
proposed
to
fix
the
standard
of
his
finesse
which
fortune
had
now
empowered
him
to
exercise
according
to
his
wish
bent
upon
this
retreat
he
went
abroad
in
the
morning
on
pretence
of
acting
in
the
concerns
of
his
friend
don
diego
and
having
hired
a
to
be
ready
at
the
dawning
of
next
day
returned
to
his
lodgings
where
he
cajoled
the
spaniard
with
a
feigned
report
of
his
negotiation
then
securing
his
most
valuable
effects
about
his
person
arose
with
the
cock
repaired
to
the
place
at
which
he
had
appointed
to
meet
the
postillion
with
the
carriage
and
set
out
for
england
without
further
delay
leaving
the
unhappy
zelos
to
the
horrors
of
indigence
and
the
additional
agony
of
this
fresh
disappointment
yet
he
was
not
the
only
person
affected
by
the
abrupt
departure
of
fathom
which
was
hastened
by
the
importunities
threats
and
reproaches
of
his
daughter
whom
he
had
debauched
under
promise
of
marriage
and
now
left
in
the
fourth
month
of
her
pregnancy
notwithstanding
the
dangerous
adventure
in
which
he
had
been
formerly
involved
by
travelling
in
the
night
he
did
not
think
proper
to
make
the
usual
halts
on
this
journey
for
sleep
or
refreshment
nor
did
he
once
quit
the
chaise
till
his
arrival
at
boulogne
which
he
reached
in
twenty
hours
after
his
departure
from
paris
here
he
thought
he
might
safely
indulge
himself
with
a
comfortable
meal
accordingly
he
bespoke
a
poulard
for
dinner
and
while
that
was
preparing
went
forth
to
view
the
city
and
harbour
when
he
beheld
the
white
cliffs
of
albion
his
heart
throbbed
with
all
the
joy
of
a
beloved
son
who
after
a
tedious
and
fatiguing
voyage
reviews
the
chimneys
of
his
father
house
he
surveyed
the
neighbouring
coast
of
england
with
fond
and
longing
eyes
like
another
moses
reconnoitring
the
land
of
canaan
from
the
top
of
mount
pisgah
and
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
was
he
inflamed
by
the
sight
that
instead
of
proceeding
to
calais
he
resolved
to
take
his
passage
directly
from
boulogne
even
if
he
should
hire
a
vessel
for
the
purpose
with
these
sentiments
he
inquired
if
there
was
any
ship
bound
for
england
and
was
so
fortunate
as
to
find
the
master
of
a
small
bark
who
intended
to
weigh
anchor
for
deal
that
same
evening
at
high
water
transported
with
this
information
he
immediately
agreed
for
his
passage
sold
the
to
his
landlord
for
thirty
guineas
as
a
piece
of
furniture
for
which
he
could
have
no
further
use
purchased
a
portmanteau
together
with
some
linen
and
wearing
apparel
and
at
the
recommendation
of
his
host
took
into
his
service
an
extra
postillion
or
helper
who
had
formerly
worn
the
livery
of
a
travelling
marquis
this
new
domestic
whose
name
was
maurice
underwent
with
great
applause
the
examination
of
our
hero
who
perceived
in
him
a
fund
of
sagacity
and
presence
of
mind
by
which
he
was
excellently
qualified
for
being
the
valet
of
an
adventurer
he
was
therefore
accommodated
with
a
suit
and
another
shirt
and
at
once
listed
under
the
banners
of
count
fathom
who
spent
the
whole
afternoon
in
giving
him
proper
instructions
for
the
regulation
of
his
conduct
having
settled
these
preliminaries
to
his
own
satisfaction
he
and
his
baggage
were
embarked
about
six
in
the
month
of
september
and
it
was
not
without
emotion
that
he
found
himself
benighted
upon
the
great
deep
of
which
before
the
preceding
day
he
had
never
enjoyed
even
the
most
distant
prospect
however
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
afraid
where
there
was
really
no
appearance
of
danger
and
the
agreeable
presages
of
future
fortune
supported
his
spirits
amidst
the
disagreeable
nausea
which
commonly
attends
landsmen
at
sea
until
he
was
set
ashore
upon
the
beach
at
deal
which
he
entered
in
good
health
about
seven
in
the
morning
like
caesar
however
he
found
some
difficulty
in
landing
on
account
of
the
swelling
surf
that
tumbled
about
with
such
violence
as
had
almost
overset
the
cutter
that
carried
him
on
shore
and
in
his
eagerness
to
jump
upon
the
strand
his
foot
slipped
from
the
side
of
the
boat
so
that
he
was
thrown
forwards
in
an
horizontal
direction
and
his
hands
were
the
first
parts
of
him
that
touched
english
ground
upon
this
occasion
he
in
imitation
of
scipio
behaviour
on
the
coast
of
africa
hailed
the
omen
and
grasping
a
handful
of
the
sand
was
heard
to
exclaim
in
the
italian
language
ah
ah
old
england
i
have
thee
fast
as
he
walked
up
to
the
inn
followed
by
maurice
loaded
with
his
portmanteau
he
congratulated
himself
upon
his
happy
voyage
and
the
peaceable
possession
of
his
spoil
and
could
not
help
snuffing
up
the
british
air
with
marks
of
infinite
relish
and
satisfaction
his
first
care
was
to
recompense
himself
for
the
want
of
sleep
he
had
undergone
and
after
he
had
sufficiently
recruited
himself
with
several
hours
of
uninterrupted
repose
he
set
out
in
a
for
canterbury
where
he
took
a
place
in
the
london
stage
which
he
was
told
would
depart
next
morning
the
coach
being
already
full
on
this
very
first
day
of
his
arrival
he
perceived
between
the
english
and
the
people
among
whom
he
had
hitherto
lived
such
essential
difference
in
customs
appearance
and
way
of
living
as
inspired
him
with
high
notions
of
that
british
freedom
opulence
and
convenience
on
which
he
had
often
heard
his
mother
expatiate
on
the
road
he
feasted
his
eyesight
with
the
verdant
hills
covered
with
flocks
of
sheep
the
fruitful
vales
parcelled
out
into
cultivated
enclosures
the
very
cattle
seemed
to
profit
by
the
wealth
of
their
masters
being
large
sturdy
and
sleek
and
every
peasant
breathed
the
insolence
of
liberty
and
independence
in
a
word
he
viewed
the
plains
of
kent
with
a
lover
eye
and
his
ambition
becoming
romantic
could
not
help
fancying
himself
another
conqueror
of
the
isle
he
was
not
however
long
amused
by
these
vain
chimeras
which
soon
vanished
before
other
reflections
of
more
importance
and
solidity
his
imagination
it
must
be
owned
was
at
all
times
too
chaste
to
admit
those
overweening
hopes
which
often
mislead
the
mind
of
the
projector
he
had
studied
mankind
with
incredible
diligence
and
knew
perfectly
well
how
far
he
could
depend
on
the
passions
and
foibles
of
human
nature
that
he
might
now
act
consistent
with
his
former
sagacity
he
resolved
to
pass
himself
upon
his
for
a
french
gentleman
equally
a
stranger
to
the
language
and
country
of
england
in
order
to
glean
from
their
discourse
such
intelligence
as
might
avail
him
in
his
future
operations
and
his
lacquey
was
tutored
accordingly
chapter
some
account
of
his
those
who
had
taken
places
for
the
coach
understanding
the
sixth
seat
was
engaged
by
a
foreigner
determined
to
profit
by
his
ignorance
and
with
that
politeness
which
is
peculiar
to
this
happy
island
fixed
themselves
in
the
vehicle
in
such
a
manner
before
he
had
the
least
intimation
of
their
design
that
he
found
it
barely
practicable
to
insinuate
himself
sidelong
between
a
corpulent
quaker
and
a
fat
wapping
landlady
in
which
attitude
he
stuck
fast
like
a
thin
quarto
between
two
voluminous
dictionaries
on
a
bookseller
shelf
and
as
if
the
pain
and
inconvenience
of
such
compression
was
not
sufficient
matter
of
chagrin
the
greatest
part
of
the
company
entertained
themselves
with
laughing
at
his
ludicrous
station
the
jolly
dame
at
his
left
hand
observed
with
a
loud
exclamation
of
mirth
that
monsieur
would
be
soon
better
acquainted
with
a
buttock
of
english
beef
and
said
by
that
time
they
should
arrive
at
their
he
might
be
spitted
without
larding
yes
verily
replied
obadiah
who
was
a
wag
in
his
way
but
the
swine
fat
will
be
all
on
one
side
so
much
the
better
for
you
cried
mine
hostess
for
that
side
is
all
your
own
the
quaker
was
not
so
much
disconcerted
by
the
quickness
of
this
repartee
but
that
he
answered
with
great
deliberation
i
thank
thee
for
thy
love
but
will
not
profit
by
thy
loss
especially
as
i
like
not
the
savour
of
these
outlandish
fowls
they
are
profane
birds
of
passage
relished
only
by
the
children
of
vanity
like
thee
the
plump
gentlewoman
took
umbrage
at
this
last
expression
which
she
considered
as
a
double
reproach
and
repeated
the
words
children
of
vanity
with
an
emphasis
of
resentment
i
believe
if
the
truth
were
known
said
she
there
more
vanity
than
midriff
in
that
great
belly
of
yours
for
all
your
pretending
to
humility
and
religion
sirrah
my
corporation
is
made
up
of
good
wholesome
english
fat
but
you
are
puffed
up
with
the
wind
of
vanity
and
delusion
and
when
it
begins
to
gripe
your
entrails
you
pretend
to
have
a
motion
and
then
get
up
and
preach
nonsense
yet
you
take
it
upon
you
to
call
your
betters
children
marry
come
up
goosecap
i
have
got
children
that
are
as
good
men
as
you
or
any
hypocritical
trembler
in
england
a
person
who
sat
opposite
to
the
quaker
hearing
this
remonstrance
which
seemed
pregnant
with
contention
interposed
in
the
conversation
with
a
conscious
leer
and
begged
there
might
be
no
rupture
between
the
spirit
and
the
flesh
by
this
remonstrance
he
relieved
obadiah
from
the
satire
of
this
female
orator
and
brought
the
whole
vengeance
of
her
elocution
upon
his
own
head
flesh
cried
she
with
all
the
ferocity
of
an
enraged
thalestris
none
of
your
names
yellowchaps
what
i
warrant
you
have
an
antipathy
to
flesh
because
you
yourself
are
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
i
suppose
you
are
some
poor
starved
journeyman
tailor
come
from
france
where
you
have
been
learning
to
cabbage
and
have
not
seen
a
good
meal
of
victuals
these
seven
years
you
have
been
living
upon
and
and
now
you
come
over
like
a
walking
atomy
with
a
rat
tail
at
your
wig
and
a
tinsey
jacket
and
so
forsooth
you
set
up
for
a
gentleman
and
pretend
to
find
fault
with
a
sirloin
of
roast
beef
the
gentleman
heard
this
address
with
admirable
patience
and
when
she
had
rung
out
her
alarm
very
coolly
replied
anything
but
your
stinking
fish
madam
since
when
i
pray
have
you
travelled
in
and
left
off
your
old
profession
of
crying
oysters
in
winter
and
rotten
mackerel
in
june
you
was
then
known
by
the
name
of
kate
brawn
and
in
good
repute
among
the
in
thames
street
till
that
unlucky
amour
with
the
master
of
a
in
which
he
was
unfortunately
detected
by
his
own
spouse
but
you
seem
to
have
risen
by
that
fall
and
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
present
plight
though
considering
your
education
on
bear
quay
you
can
give
but
a
sorry
account
of
yourself
the
amazon
though
neither
exhausted
nor
dismayed
was
really
confounded
at
the
temper
and
assurance
of
this
antagonist
who
had
gathered
all
these
anecdotes
from
the
fertility
of
his
own
invention
after
a
short
pause
however
she
poured
forth
a
torrent
of
obloquy
sufficient
to
overwhelm
any
person
who
had
not
been
used
to
take
up
arms
against
such
seas
of
trouble
and
a
dispute
ensued
which
would
have
not
only
disgraced
the
best
orators
on
the
thames
but
even
have
made
a
figure
in
the
celebration
of
the
eleusinian
mysteries
during
which
the
athenian
matrons
rallied
one
another
from
different
waggons
with
that
freedom
of
altercation
so
happily
preserved
in
this
our
age
and
country
such
a
redundancy
of
epithets
and
variety
of
metaphors
tropes
and
figures
were
uttered
between
these
opponents
that
an
epic
bard
would
have
found
his
account
in
listening
to
the
contest
which
in
all
probability
would
not
have
been
confined
to
words
had
it
not
been
interrupted
for
the
sake
of
a
young
woman
of
an
agreeable
countenance
and
modest
carriage
who
being
shocked
at
some
of
their
flowers
of
speech
and
terrified
by
the
menacing
looks
and
gestures
of
the
dame
began
to
scream
aloud
and
beg
leave
to
quit
the
coach
her
perturbation
put
an
end
to
the
high
debate
the
sixth
passenger
who
had
not
opened
his
mouth
endeavoured
to
comfort
her
with
assurances
of
protection
the
quaker
proposed
a
cessation
of
arms
the
male
disputant
acquiesced
in
the
proposal
assuring
the
company
he
had
entered
the
lists
for
their
entertainment
only
without
acquiring
the
least
grudge
or
to
the
fat
gentlewoman
whom
he
protested
he
had
never
seen
before
that
day
and
who
for
aught
he
knew
was
a
person
of
credit
and
reputation
he
then
held
forth
his
hand
in
token
of
amity
and
asked
pardon
of
the
offended
party
who
was
appeased
by
his
submission
and
in
testimony
of
her
benevolence
presented
to
the
other
female
whom
she
had
discomposed
an
bottle
filled
with
recommending
it
as
a
much
more
powerful
remedy
than
the
which
the
other
held
to
her
nose
peace
being
thus
in
a
treaty
comprehending
obadiah
and
all
present
it
will
not
be
improper
to
give
the
reader
some
further
information
touching
the
several
characters
assembled
in
this
vehicle
the
quaker
was
a
london
merchant
who
had
been
at
deal
superintending
the
repairs
of
a
ship
which
had
suffered
by
a
storm
in
the
downs
the
wapping
landlady
was
on
her
return
from
the
same
place
where
she
had
attended
the
payment
of
a
with
sundry
powers
of
attorney
granted
by
the
sailors
who
had
lived
upon
credit
at
her
house
her
competitor
in
fame
was
a
dealer
in
wine
a
smuggler
of
french
lace
and
a
petty
gamester
just
arrived
from
paris
in
the
company
of
an
english
barber
who
sat
on
his
right
hand
and
the
young
woman
was
daughter
of
a
country
curate
in
her
way
to
london
where
she
was
bound
apprentice
to
a
milliner
hitherto
fathom
had
sat
in
silent
astonishment
at
the
manners
of
his
which
far
exceeded
the
notions
he
had
preconceived
of
english
plainness
and
rusticity
he
found
himself
a
monument
of
that
disregard
and
contempt
which
a
stranger
never
fails
to
meet
with
from
the
inhabitants
of
this
island
and
saw
with
surprise
an
agreeable
young
creature
sit
as
solitary
and
unheeded
as
himself
he
was
indeed
allured
by
the
roses
of
her
complexion
and
the
innocence
of
her
aspect
and
began
to
repent
of
having
pretended
ignorance
of
the
language
by
which
he
was
restrained
from
exercising
his
eloquence
upon
her
heart
he
resolved
however
to
ingratiate
himself
if
possible
by
the
courtesy
and
politeness
of
dumb
show
and
for
that
purpose
put
his
eyes
in
motion
without
farther
delay
chapter
another
providential
deliverance
from
the
effects
of
the
ingenious
conjecture
during
these
deliberations
the
wine
merchant
with
a
view
to
make
a
parade
of
his
superior
parts
and
breeding
as
well
as
to
pave
the
way
for
a
match
at
backgammon
made
a
tender
of
his
to
our
adventurer
and
asked
in
bad
french
how
he
travelled
from
paris
this
question
produced
a
series
of
interrogations
concerning
the
place
of
abode
in
that
city
and
his
business
in
england
so
that
he
was
fain
to
practise
the
science
of
defence
and
answered
with
such
ambiguity
as
aroused
the
suspicion
of
the
smuggler
who
began
to
believe
our
hero
had
some
very
cogent
reason
for
evading
his
curiosity
he
immediately
set
his
reflection
at
work
and
after
various
conjectures
fixed
upon
being
the
young
pretender
big
with
this
supposition
he
eyed
him
with
the
most
earnest
attention
comparing
his
features
with
those
of
the
chevalier
portrait
which
he
had
seen
in
france
and
though
the
faces
were
as
unlike
as
any
two
human
faces
could
be
found
the
resemblance
so
striking
as
to
dispel
all
his
doubts
and
persuade
him
to
introduce
the
stranger
to
some
justice
on
the
road
a
step
by
which
he
would
not
only
manifest
his
zeal
for
the
protestant
succession
but
also
acquire
the
splendid
reward
proposed
by
parliament
to
any
person
who
should
apprehend
that
famous
adventurer
these
ideas
intoxicated
the
brain
of
this
man
to
such
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
that
he
actually
believed
himself
in
possession
of
the
thirty
thousand
pounds
and
amused
his
fancy
with
a
variety
of
magnificent
projects
to
be
executed
by
means
of
that
acquisition
until
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
halting
of
the
coach
at
the
inn
where
the
passengers
used
to
eat
their
breakfasts
waked
as
he
was
from
the
dream
of
happiness
it
had
made
such
impression
upon
his
mind
that
seeing
fathom
rise
up
with
an
intention
to
alight
he
took
it
for
granted
his
design
was
to
escape
and
seizing
him
by
the
collar
called
aloud
for
assistance
in
the
king
name
our
hero
whose
sagacity
and
presence
of
mind
very
often
supplied
the
place
of
courage
instead
of
being
terrified
at
this
assault
which
might
have
disturbed
the
tranquillity
of
an
ordinary
villain
was
so
perfectly
master
of
every
circumstance
of
his
own
situation
as
to
know
at
once
that
the
aggressor
could
not
possibly
have
the
least
cause
of
complaint
against
him
and
therefore
imputing
this
violence
either
to
madness
or
mistake
very
deliberately
suffered
himself
to
be
made
prisoner
by
the
people
of
the
house
who
ran
to
the
coach
door
in
obedience
to
the
summons
of
the
wine
merchant
the
rest
of
the
company
were
struck
dumb
with
surprise
and
consternation
at
this
sudden
adventure
and
the
quaker
dreading
some
fell
resistance
on
the
side
of
the
outlandish
man
unpinned
the
other
coach
door
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
trundled
himself
into
the
mud
for
safety
the
others
seeing
the
temper
and
resignation
of
the
prisoner
soon
recovered
their
recollection
and
began
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
his
arrest
upon
which
the
captor
whose
teeth
chattered
with
terror
and
impatience
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
was
a
state
criminal
and
demanded
their
help
in
conveying
him
to
justice
luckily
for
both
parties
there
happened
to
be
at
the
inn
a
company
of
squires
just
returned
from
the
death
of
a
leash
of
hares
which
they
had
ordered
to
be
dressed
for
dinner
and
among
these
gentlemen
was
one
of
the
quorum
to
whom
the
accuser
had
immediate
recourse
marching
before
the
captive
who
walked
very
peaceably
between
the
landlord
and
one
of
his
waiters
and
followed
by
a
crowd
of
spectators
some
of
whom
had
secured
the
faithful
maurice
who
in
his
behaviour
closely
imitated
the
deliberation
of
his
master
in
this
order
did
the
procession
advance
to
the
apartment
in
which
the
magistrate
with
his
fellows
of
the
chase
sat
smoking
his
morning
pipe
over
a
tankard
of
strong
ale
and
the
smuggler
being
directed
to
the
right
person
may
it
please
your
worship
said
he
i
have
brought
this
foreigner
before
you
on
a
violent
suspicion
of
his
being
a
proclaimed
outlaw
and
i
desire
before
these
witnesses
that
my
title
may
be
made
good
to
the
reward
that
shall
become
due
upon
his
conviction
friend
replied
the
justice
i
know
nothing
of
you
or
your
titles
but
this
i
know
if
you
have
any
information
to
give
in
you
must
come
to
my
house
when
i
am
at
home
and
proceed
in
a
lawful
way
that
is
d
mind
me
if
you
swear
as
how
this
here
person
is
an
outlaw
then
if
so
be
as
he
has
nothing
to
say
to
the
contrary
my
clerk
shall
make
out
a
mittimus
and
so
to
jail
with
him
till
next
but
sir
answered
the
impeacher
this
is
a
case
that
admits
of
no
delay
the
person
i
have
apprehended
is
a
prisoner
of
consequence
to
the
state
how
fellor
cried
the
magistrate
interrupting
him
is
there
any
person
of
more
consequence
than
one
of
his
majesty
justices
of
the
peace
who
is
besides
a
considerable
member
of
the
landed
interest
d
know
sirrah
who
you
are
talking
to
if
you
do
go
about
your
business
i
believe
i
shall
lay
you
by
the
heels
the
smuggler
fearing
his
prize
would
escape
through
the
ignorance
pride
and
obstinacy
of
this
country
justice
approached
his
worship
and
in
a
whisper
which
was
overheard
by
all
the
company
assured
him
he
had
indubitable
reason
to
believe
the
foreigner
was
no
other
than
the
pretender
eldest
son
at
mention
of
this
formidable
name
every
individual
of
the
audience
started
with
signs
of
terror
and
amazement
the
justice
dropped
his
pipe
recoiled
upon
his
chair
and
looking
most
ridiculously
aghast
exclaimed
seize
him
in
the
name
of
god
and
his
majesty
king
george
has
he
got
no
secret
arms
about
him
fathom
being
thus
informed
of
the
suspicion
under
which
he
stood
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
eagerness
with
which
the
spectators
flew
upon
him
and
suffered
himself
to
be
searched
with
great
composure
well
knowing
they
would
find
no
moveables
about
his
person
but
such
as
upon
examination
would
turn
to
his
account
he
therefore
very
calmly
presented
to
the
magistrate
his
purse
and
a
small
box
that
contained
his
jewels
and
in
the
french
language
desired
they
might
be
preserved
from
the
hands
of
the
mob
this
request
was
interpreted
by
the
accuser
who
at
the
same
time
laid
claim
to
the
booty
the
justice
took
charge
of
the
deposit
and
one
of
his
neighbours
having
undertaken
the
office
of
clerk
he
proceeded
to
the
examination
of
the
culprit
whose
papers
were
by
this
time
laid
on
the
table
before
him
stranger
said
he
you
stand
charged
with
being
son
of
the
pretender
to
these
realms
what
have
you
to
say
in
your
own
defence
our
hero
assured
him
in
the
french
language
that
he
was
falsely
impeached
and
demanded
justice
on
the
accuser
who
without
the
least
reason
had
made
such
a
malicious
attack
upon
the
life
and
honour
of
an
innocent
gentleman
the
smuggler
instead
of
acting
the
part
of
a
faithful
interpreter
told
his
worship
that
the
prisoner
answer
was
no
more
than
a
simple
denial
which
every
felon
would
make
who
had
nothing
else
to
plead
in
his
own
behalf
and
that
this
alone
was
a
strong
presumption
of
his
guilt
because
if
he
was
not
really
the
person
they
suspected
him
to
be
the
thing
would
speak
for
itself
for
if
he
was
not
the
young
pretender
who
then
was
he
this
argument
had
great
weight
with
the
justice
who
assuming
a
very
important
aspect
observed
very
true
friend
if
you
are
not
the
pretender
in
the
name
of
god
who
are
you
one
may
see
with
half
an
eye
that
he
is
no
better
than
a
promiscuous
fellow
ferdinand
now
began
to
repent
of
having
pretended
ignorance
of
the
english
language
as
he
found
himself
at
the
mercy
of
a
rascal
who
put
a
false
gloss
upon
all
his
words
and
addressed
himself
to
the
audience
successively
in
french
high
dutch
italian
and
hungarian
latin
desiring
to
know
if
any
person
present
understood
any
of
these
tongues
that
his
answers
might
be
honestly
explained
to
the
bench
but
he
might
have
accosted
them
in
chinese
with
the
same
success
there
was
not
one
person
present
tolerably
versed
in
his
much
less
acquainted
with
any
foreign
language
except
the
wine
merchant
who
incensed
at
this
appeal
which
he
considered
as
an
affront
to
his
integrity
gave
the
judge
to
understand
that
the
delinquent
instead
of
speaking
to
the
purpose
contumaciously
insulted
his
authority
in
sundry
foreign
lingos
which
he
apprehended
was
an
additional
proof
of
his
being
the
chevalier
son
inasmuch
as
no
person
would
take
the
pains
to
learn
such
a
variety
of
gibberish
except
with
some
sinister
intent
this
annotation
was
not
lost
upon
the
squire
who
was
too
jealous
of
the
honour
of
his
office
to
overlook
such
a
flagrant
instance
of
contempt
his
eyes
glistened
his
cheeks
were
inflated
with
rage
the
case
is
plain
said
he
having
nothing
of
signification
to
offer
in
his
own
favour
he
grows
refractory
and
abuses
the
court
in
his
base
roman
catholic
jargon
but
i
let
you
know
for
all
you
pretend
to
be
a
prince
you
are
no
better
than
an
outlawed
vagrant
and
i
show
you
what
a
thing
you
are
when
you
come
in
composition
with
an
english
justice
like
me
who
have
more
than
once
extinguished
myself
in
the
service
of
my
country
as
nothing
else
accrues
your
purse
black
box
and
papers
shall
be
sealed
up
before
witnesses
and
sent
by
express
to
one
of
his
majesty
secretaries
of
state
and
as
for
yourself
i
will
apply
to
the
military
at
canterbury
for
a
guard
to
conduct
you
to
london
this
was
a
very
unwelcome
declaration
to
our
adventurer
who
was
on
the
point
of
haranguing
the
justice
and
spectators
in
their
own
language
when
he
was
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
taking
that
step
by
the
interposition
of
a
young
nobleman
just
arrived
at
the
inn
who
being
informed
of
this
strange
examination
entered
the
court
and
at
first
sight
of
the
prisoner
assured
the
justice
he
was
imposed
upon
for
that
he
himself
had
often
seen
the
young
pretender
in
paris
and
that
there
was
no
kind
of
resemblance
between
that
adventurer
and
the
person
now
before
him
the
accuser
was
not
a
little
mortified
at
his
affirmation
which
met
with
all
due
regard
from
the
bench
though
the
magistrate
took
notice
that
granting
the
prisoner
was
not
the
young
chevalier
himself
it
was
highly
probable
he
was
an
emissary
of
that
house
as
he
could
give
no
satisfactory
account
of
himself
and
was
possessed
of
things
of
such
value
as
no
honest
man
could
expose
to
the
accidents
of
the
road
fathom
having
thus
found
an
interpreter
who
signified
to
him
in
the
french
tongue
the
doubts
of
the
justice
told
his
lordship
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
a
noble
house
in
germany
who
for
certain
reasons
had
come
abroad
incognito
with
a
view
to
see
the
world
and
that
although
the
letters
they
had
seized
would
prove
the
truth
of
that
assertion
he
should
be
loth
to
expose
his
private
concerns
to
the
knowledge
of
strangers
if
he
could
possibly
be
released
without
that
mortification
the
young
nobleman
explained
his
desire
to
the
court
but
his
own
curiosity
being
interested
observed
at
the
same
time
that
the
justice
could
not
be
said
to
have
discharged
the
duties
of
his
station
until
he
should
have
examined
every
circumstance
relating
to
the
prisoner
upon
which
remonstrance
he
was
requested
by
the
bench
to
peruse
the
papers
and
accordingly
communicated
the
substance
of
one
letter
to
this
effect
my
dear
son
though
i
am
far
from
approving
the
rash
step
you
have
taken
in
withdrawing
yourself
from
your
father
house
in
order
to
avoid
an
engagement
which
would
have
been
equally
honourable
and
advantageous
to
your
family
i
can
not
so
far
suppress
my
affection
as
to
bear
the
thought
of
your
undergoing
those
hardships
which
for
your
disobedience
you
deserve
to
suffer
i
have
therefore
without
the
knowledge
of
your
father
sent
the
bearer
to
attend
you
in
your
peregrinations
his
fidelity
you
know
hath
been
tried
in
a
long
course
of
service
and
i
have
entrusted
to
his
care
for
your
use
a
purse
of
two
hundred
ducats
and
a
box
of
jewels
to
the
value
of
twice
that
sum
which
though
not
sufficient
to
support
an
equipage
suitable
to
your
birth
will
at
least
for
some
time
preserve
you
from
the
importunities
of
want
when
you
are
dutiful
enough
to
explain
your
designs
and
situation
you
may
expect
further
indulgence
from
your
tender
and
disconsolate
mother
countess
of
fathom
this
letter
which
as
well
as
the
others
our
hero
had
forged
for
the
purpose
effectually
answered
his
intent
in
throwing
dust
in
the
eyes
and
understanding
of
the
spectators
who
now
regarded
the
prisoner
with
looks
of
respectful
remorse
as
a
man
of
quality
who
had
been
falsely
accused
his
lordship
to
make
a
parade
of
his
own
politeness
and
importance
assured
the
bench
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
family
of
the
fathoms
and
with
a
compliment
gave
ferdinand
to
understand
he
had
formerly
seen
him
at
versailles
there
being
no
longer
room
for
suspicion
the
justice
ordered
our
adventurer
to
be
set
at
liberty
and
even
invited
him
to
be
seated
with
an
apology
for
the
rude
manner
in
which
he
had
been
treated
owing
to
the
misinformation
of
the
accuser
who
was
threatened
with
the
stocks
for
his
malice
and
presumption
but
this
was
not
the
only
triumph
our
hero
obtained
over
the
wine
merchant
maurice
was
no
sooner
unfettered
than
advancing
into
the
middle
of
the
room
my
lord
said
he
addressing
himself
in
french
to
his
master
deliverer
since
you
have
been
so
generous
as
to
protect
a
noble
stranger
from
the
danger
of
such
a
false
accusation
i
hope
you
will
still
lay
an
additional
obligation
upon
the
count
by
retorting
the
vengeance
of
the
law
upon
his
perfidious
accuser
whom
i
know
to
be
a
trader
in
those
articles
of
merchandise
which
are
prohibited
by
the
ordinances
of
this
nation
i
have
seen
him
lately
at
boulogne
and
am
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
some
persons
who
have
supplied
him
with
french
lace
and
embroidery
and
as
a
proof
of
what
i
allege
i
desire
you
will
order
him
and
this
barber
who
is
his
understrapper
to
be
examined
on
the
spot
this
charge
which
was
immediately
explained
to
the
bench
yielded
extraordinary
satisfaction
to
the
spectators
one
of
whom
being
an
officer
of
the
customs
forthwith
began
to
exercise
his
function
upon
the
unlucky
perruquier
who
being
stripped
of
his
upper
garments
and
even
of
his
shirt
appeared
like
the
mummy
of
an
egyptian
king
most
curiously
rolled
up
in
bandages
of
rich
figured
gold
shalloon
that
covered
the
skirts
of
four
embroidered
waistcoats
the
merchant
seeing
his
expectation
so
unhappily
reversed
made
an
effort
to
retire
with
a
most
rueful
aspect
but
was
prevented
by
the
officer
who
demanded
the
interposition
of
the
civil
power
that
he
might
undergo
the
same
examination
to
which
the
other
had
been
subjected
he
was
accordingly
rifled
without
loss
of
time
and
the
inquiry
proved
well
worth
the
care
of
him
who
made
it
for
a
considerable
booty
of
the
same
sort
of
merchandise
was
found
in
his
boots
breeches
hat
and
between
the
buckram
and
lining
of
his
surtout
yet
not
contented
with
this
prize
the
experienced
spoiler
proceeded
to
search
his
baggage
and
perceiving
a
false
bottom
in
his
portmanteau
detected
beneath
it
a
valuable
accession
to
the
plunder
he
had
already
obtained
chapter
thirty
the
singular
manner
of
fathom
attack
and
triumph
over
the
virtue
of
the
fair
elenor
proper
cognisance
being
thus
taken
of
these
contraband
effects
and
the
informer
furnished
with
a
certificate
by
which
he
was
entitled
to
a
share
of
the
seizure
the
coachman
summoned
his
passengers
to
the
carriage
the
purse
and
jewels
were
restored
to
count
fathom
who
thanked
the
justice
and
his
lordship
in
particular
for
the
candour
and
hospitality
with
which
he
had
been
treated
and
resumed
his
place
in
the
vehicle
amidst
the
congratulations
of
all
his
except
the
two
forlorn
smugglers
who
instead
of
in
the
coach
thought
proper
to
remain
at
the
inn
with
view
to
mitigate
if
possible
the
severity
of
their
misfortune
among
those
who
felicitated
fathom
upon
the
issue
of
this
adventure
the
young
maiden
seemed
to
express
the
most
sensible
pleasure
at
that
event
the
artful
language
of
his
eyes
had
raised
in
her
breast
certain
fluttering
emotions
before
she
knew
the
value
of
her
conquest
but
now
that
his
rank
and
condition
were
discovered
these
transports
were
increased
by
the
ideas
of
vanity
and
ambition
which
are
mingled
with
the
first
seeds
of
every
female
constitution
the
belief
of
having
captivated
the
heart
of
a
man
who
could
raise
her
to
the
rank
and
dignity
of
a
countess
produced
such
agreeable
sensations
in
her
fancy
that
her
eyes
shone
with
unusual
lustre
and
a
continual
smile
played
in
dimples
on
her
rosy
cheeks
so
that
her
attractions
though
not
powerful
enough
to
engage
the
affection
were
yet
sufficient
to
inflame
the
desire
of
our
adventurer
who
very
honestly
marked
her
chastity
for
prey
to
his
voluptuous
passion
had
she
been
well
seasoned
with
knowledge
and
experience
and
completely
armed
with
caution
against
the
artifice
and
villany
of
man
her
virtue
might
not
have
been
able
to
withstand
the
engines
of
such
an
assailant
considering
the
dangerous
opportunities
to
which
she
was
necessarily
exposed
how
easy
then
must
his
victory
have
been
over
an
innocent
unsuspecting
country
damsel
flushed
with
the
warmth
of
youth
and
an
utter
stranger
to
the
ways
of
life
while
obadiah
therefore
and
his
plump
companion
were
engaged
in
conversation
on
the
strange
incidents
which
had
passed
fathom
acted
a
very
expressive
pantomime
with
this
fair
buxom
nymph
who
comprehended
his
meaning
with
surprising
facility
and
was
at
so
little
pains
to
conceal
the
pleasure
she
took
in
this
kind
of
intercourse
that
several
warm
squeezes
were
interchanged
between
her
and
her
lover
before
they
arrived
at
rochester
where
they
proposed
to
dine
it
was
during
this
period
he
learned
from
the
answers
she
made
to
the
inquisitive
quaker
that
her
sole
dependence
was
upon
a
relation
to
whom
she
had
a
letter
and
that
she
was
a
perfect
stranger
in
the
great
city
circumstances
on
which
he
soon
formed
the
project
of
her
ruin
upon
their
arrival
at
the
black
bull
he
for
the
first
time
found
himself
alone
with
his
amanda
whose
name
was
elenor
their
being
elsewhere
employed
about
their
own
concerns
and
unwilling
to
lose
the
precious
opportunity
he
began
to
act
the
part
of
a
very
importunate
lover
which
he
conceived
to
be
a
proper
sequel
to
the
prelude
which
had
been
performed
in
the
coach
the
freedoms
which
she
out
of
pure
simplicity
and
permitted
him
to
take
with
her
hand
and
even
her
rosy
lips
encouraged
him
to
practise
other
familiarities
upon
her
fair
bosom
which
scandalised
her
virtue
so
much
that
in
spite
of
the
passion
she
had
begun
to
indulge
in
his
behalf
she
rejected
his
advances
with
all
the
marks
of
anger
and
disdain
and
he
found
it
necessary
to
appease
the
storm
he
had
raised
by
the
most
respectful
and
submissive
demeanour
resolving
to
change
his
operations
and
carry
on
his
attacks
so
as
to
make
her
yield
at
discretion
without
alarming
her
religion
or
pride
accordingly
when
the
bill
was
called
after
dinner
he
took
particular
notice
of
her
behaviour
and
perceiving
her
pull
out
a
large
leathern
purse
that
contained
her
money
reconnoitred
the
pocket
in
which
it
was
deposited
and
while
they
sat
close
to
each
other
in
the
carriage
conveyed
it
with
admirable
dexterity
into
an
hole
in
the
cushion
whether
the
corpulent
couple
who
sat
opposite
to
these
lovers
had
entered
into
an
amorous
engagement
at
the
inn
or
were
severally
induced
by
other
motives
is
uncertain
but
sure
it
is
both
left
the
coach
on
that
part
of
the
road
which
lies
nearest
to
gravesend
and
bade
adieu
to
the
other
pair
on
pretence
of
having
urgent
business
at
that
place
ferdinand
not
a
little
pleased
at
their
departure
renewed
his
most
pathetic
expressions
of
love
and
sung
several
french
songs
on
that
tender
subject
which
seemed
to
thrill
to
the
soul
of
his
beauteous
helen
while
the
driver
halted
at
dartford
to
water
his
horses
she
was
smit
with
the
appearance
of
some
cheesecakes
which
were
presented
by
the
landlady
of
the
house
and
having
bargained
for
two
or
three
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
in
order
to
pay
for
her
purchase
but
what
was
her
astonishment
when
after
having
rummaged
her
equipage
she
understood
her
whole
fortune
was
lost
this
mishap
was
by
a
loud
shriek
announced
to
our
hero
who
affected
infinite
amazement
and
concern
and
no
sooner
learned
the
cause
of
her
affliction
than
he
presented
her
with
his
own
purse
from
which
he
in
emphatic
dumb
show
begged
she
would
indemnify
herself
for
the
damage
she
had
sustained
although
this
kind
proffer
was
some
alleviation
of
her
misfortunes
she
did
not
fail
to
pour
forth
a
most
piteous
lamentation
importing
that
she
had
not
only
lost
all
her
money
amounting
to
five
pounds
but
also
her
letter
of
recommendation
upon
which
she
had
altogether
relied
for
present
employment
the
vehicle
was
minutely
searched
from
top
to
bottom
by
herself
and
our
adventurer
assisted
by
maurice
and
the
coachman
who
finding
their
inquiry
ineffectual
did
not
scruple
to
declare
his
suspicion
of
the
two
fat
turtles
who
had
deserted
the
coach
in
such
an
abrupt
manner
in
a
word
he
rendered
this
conjecture
so
plausible
by
wresting
the
circumstances
of
their
behaviour
and
retreat
that
poor
elenor
implicitly
believed
they
were
the
thieves
by
whom
she
had
suffered
and
was
prevailed
upon
to
accept
the
proffered
assistance
of
the
generous
count
who
seeing
her
very
much
disordered
by
this
mischance
insisted
upon
her
drinking
a
large
glass
of
canary
to
quiet
the
perturbation
of
her
spirits
this
is
a
season
which
of
all
others
is
most
propitious
to
the
attempts
of
an
artful
lover
and
justifies
the
metaphorical
maxim
of
fishing
in
troubled
waters
there
is
an
affinity
and
short
transition
betwixt
all
the
violent
passions
that
agitate
the
human
mind
they
are
all
false
perspectives
which
though
they
magnify
yet
perplex
and
render
indistinct
every
object
which
they
represent
and
flattery
is
never
so
successfully
administered
as
to
those
who
know
they
stand
in
need
of
friendship
assent
and
approbation
the
cordial
she
swallowed
far
from
calming
increased
the
disturbance
of
her
thoughts
and
produced
an
intoxication
during
which
she
talked
in
an
incoherent
strain
laughed
and
wept
by
turns
and
acted
other
extravagances
which
are
known
to
be
symptoms
of
the
hysterical
affection
fathom
though
an
utter
stranger
to
the
sentiments
of
honour
pity
and
remorse
would
not
perpetrate
his
vicious
purpose
though
favoured
by
the
delirium
his
villany
had
entailed
upon
this
unfortunate
young
maiden
because
his
appetite
demanded
a
more
perfect
sacrifice
than
that
which
she
could
yield
in
her
present
deplorable
situation
when
her
will
must
have
been
altogether
unconcerned
in
his
success
determined
therefore
to
make
a
conquest
of
her
virtue
before
he
would
take
possession
of
her
person
he
mimicked
that
compassion
and
benevolence
which
his
heart
had
never
felt
and
when
the
coach
arrived
at
london
not
only
discharged
what
she
owed
for
her
place
but
likewise
procured
for
her
an
apartment
in
the
house
to
which
he
himself
had
been
directed
for
lodgings
and
even
hired
a
nurse
to
attend
her
during
a
severe
fever
which
was
the
consequence
of
her
disappointment
and
despondence
indeed
she
was
supplied
with
all
necessaries
by
the
generosity
of
this
noble
count
who
for
the
interest
of
his
passion
and
the
honour
of
his
name
was
resolved
to
extend
his
charity
to
the
last
farthing
of
her
own
money
which
he
had
been
wise
enough
to
secure
for
this
purpose
her
youth
soon
got
the
better
of
her
distemper
and
when
she
understood
her
obligations
to
the
count
who
did
not
fail
to
attend
her
in
person
with
great
tenderness
her
heart
which
had
been
before
prepossessed
in
his
favour
now
glowed
with
all
the
warmth
of
gratitude
esteem
and
affection
she
knew
herself
in
a
strange
place
destitute
of
all
resource
but
in
his
generosity
she
loved
his
person
she
was
dazzled
by
his
rank
and
he
knew
so
well
how
to
improve
the
opportunities
and
advantages
he
derived
from
her
unhappy
situation
that
he
gradually
proceeded
in
sapping
from
one
degree
of
intimacy
to
another
until
all
the
bulwarks
of
her
chastity
were
undermined
and
she
submitted
to
his
desire
not
with
the
reluctance
of
a
vanquished
people
but
with
all
the
transports
of
a
joyful
city
that
opens
its
gates
to
receive
a
darling
prince
returned
from
conquest
for
by
this
time
he
had
artfully
concentred
and
kindled
up
all
the
inflammable
ingredients
of
her
constitution
and
she
now
looked
back
upon
the
virtuous
principles
of
her
education
as
upon
a
disagreeable
and
tedious
dream
from
which
she
had
waked
to
the
fruition
of
joy
chapter
he
by
accident
encounters
his
old
friend
with
whom
he
holds
a
conference
and
renews
a
treaty
our
hero
having
thus
provided
himself
with
a
proper
subject
for
his
hours
of
dalliance
thought
it
was
now
high
time
to
study
the
ground
which
he
had
pitched
upon
for
the
scene
of
his
exploits
and
with
that
view
made
several
excursions
to
different
parts
of
the
town
where
there
was
aught
of
entertainment
or
instruction
to
be
found
yet
he
always
on
these
occasions
appeared
in
an
obscure
ordinary
dress
in
order
to
avoid
singularity
and
never
went
twice
to
the
same
that
his
person
might
not
be
afterwards
known
in
case
he
should
shine
forth
to
the
public
in
a
superior
sphere
on
his
return
from
one
of
those
expeditions
while
he
was
passing
through
ludgate
his
eyes
were
suddenly
encountered
by
the
apparition
of
his
old
friend
the
tyrolese
who
perceiving
himself
fairly
caught
in
the
toil
made
a
virtue
of
necessity
and
running
up
to
our
adventurer
with
an
aspect
of
eagerness
and
joy
clasped
him
in
his
arms
as
some
dear
friend
whom
he
had
casually
found
after
a
most
tedious
and
disagreeable
separation
fathom
whose
genius
never
failed
him
in
such
emergencies
far
from
receiving
these
advances
with
the
threats
and
reproaches
which
the
other
had
deserved
at
his
hands
returned
the
salute
with
equal
warmth
and
was
really
overjoyed
at
meeting
with
a
person
who
might
one
way
or
other
make
amends
for
the
perfidy
of
his
former
conduct
the
tyrolese
whose
name
was
ratchcali
pleased
with
his
reception
proposed
they
should
adjourn
to
the
next
tavern
in
which
they
had
no
sooner
taken
possession
of
an
apartment
than
he
addressed
himself
to
his
old
companion
in
these
words
fathom
by
your
frank
and
obliging
manner
of
treating
a
man
who
hath
done
you
wrong
i
am
more
and
more
confirmed
in
my
opinion
of
your
sagacity
which
i
have
often
considered
with
admiration
i
will
not
therefore
attempt
to
make
an
apology
for
my
conduct
at
our
last
parting
but
only
assure
you
that
this
meeting
may
turn
out
to
our
mutual
advantage
if
we
now
into
an
unreserved
union
the
ties
of
which
we
will
soon
find
it
our
interest
and
inclination
to
preserve
for
my
own
part
as
my
judgment
is
ripened
by
experience
so
are
my
sentiments
changed
since
our
last
association
i
have
seen
many
a
rich
harvest
lost
for
want
of
a
in
the
vineyard
and
i
have
more
than
once
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
a
combination
which
i
could
have
resisted
with
the
help
of
one
able
auxiliary
indeed
i
might
prove
what
i
allege
by
mathematical
demonstration
and
i
believe
nobody
will
pretend
to
deny
that
two
heads
are
better
than
one
in
all
cases
that
require
discernment
and
deliberation
ferdinand
could
not
help
owning
the
sanity
of
his
observations
and
forthwith
acquiesced
in
his
proposal
of
the
new
alliance
desiring
to
know
the
character
in
which
he
acted
on
the
english
stage
and
the
scheme
he
would
offer
for
their
mutual
emolument
at
the
same
time
he
resolved
within
himself
to
keep
such
a
strict
eye
over
his
future
actions
as
would
frustrate
any
design
he
might
hereafter
harbour
of
repeating
the
prank
he
had
so
successfully
played
upon
him
in
their
journey
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
having
quitted
you
at
resumed
the
tyrolese
i
travelled
without
ceasing
until
i
arrived
at
frankfort
upon
the
maine
where
i
assumed
the
character
of
a
french
chevalier
and
struck
some
masterly
strokes
which
you
yourself
would
not
have
deemed
unworthy
of
your
invention
and
my
success
was
the
more
agreeable
as
my
operations
were
chiefly
carried
on
against
the
enemies
of
our
religion
but
my
prosperity
was
not
of
long
duration
seeing
they
could
not
foil
me
at
my
own
weapons
they
formed
a
damned
conspiracy
by
which
i
not
only
lost
all
the
fruits
of
my
industry
but
likewise
ran
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
my
life
i
had
ordered
some
of
those
jewels
which
i
had
borrowed
of
my
good
friend
fathom
to
be
new
set
in
a
fashionable
taste
and
soon
after
had
an
opportunity
to
sell
one
of
these
at
a
great
advantage
to
one
of
the
fraternity
who
offered
an
extraordinary
price
for
the
stone
on
purpose
to
effect
my
ruin
in
less
than
hours
after
this
bargain
i
was
arrested
by
the
officers
of
justice
upon
the
oath
of
the
purchaser
who
undertook
to
prove
me
guilty
of
a
fraud
in
selling
a
saxon
pebble
for
a
real
diamond
and
this
accusation
was
actually
true
for
the
change
had
been
artfully
put
upon
me
by
the
jeweller
who
was
himself
engaged
in
the
conspiracy
had
my
conscience
been
clear
of
any
other
impeachment
perhaps
i
should
have
rested
my
cause
upon
the
equity
and
protection
of
the
law
but
i
foresaw
that
the
trial
would
introduce
an
inquiry
to
which
i
was
not
at
all
ambitious
of
submitting
and
therefore
was
fain
to
compromise
the
affair
at
the
price
of
almost
my
whole
fortune
yet
this
accommodation
was
not
made
so
secretly
but
that
my
character
was
blasted
and
my
credit
overthrown
so
that
i
was
fain
to
relinquish
my
occasional
equipage
and
hire
myself
as
journeyman
to
a
lapidary
an
employment
which
i
had
exercised
in
my
youth
in
this
obscure
station
i
laboured
with
great
assiduity
until
i
made
myself
perfect
in
the
knowledge
of
stones
as
well
as
in
the
different
methods
of
setting
them
off
to
the
best
advantage
and
having
by
dint
of
industry
and
address
got
possession
of
a
small
parcel
set
out
for
this
kingdom
in
which
i
happily
arrived
about
four
months
ago
and
surely
england
is
the
paradise
of
artists
of
our
profession
one
would
imagine
that
nature
had
created
the
inhabitants
for
the
support
and
enjoyment
of
adventurers
like
you
and
me
not
that
these
islanders
open
the
arms
of
hospitality
to
all
foreigners
without
distinction
on
the
contrary
they
inherit
from
their
fathers
an
unreasonable
prejudice
against
all
nations
under
the
sun
and
when
an
englishman
happens
to
quarrel
with
a
stranger
the
first
term
of
reproach
he
uses
is
the
name
of
his
antagonist
country
characterised
by
some
opprobrious
epithet
such
as
a
chattering
frenchman
an
italian
ape
a
german
hog
and
a
beastly
dutchman
nay
their
national
prepossession
is
maintained
even
against
those
people
with
whom
they
are
united
under
the
same
laws
and
government
for
nothing
is
more
common
than
to
hear
them
exclaim
against
their
in
the
expressions
of
a
beggarly
scot
and
an
impudent
irish
yet
this
very
prejudice
will
never
fail
to
turn
to
the
account
of
every
stranger
possessed
of
ordinary
talents
for
he
will
always
find
opportunities
of
conversing
with
them
in
and
places
of
public
resort
in
spite
of
their
professed
reserve
which
by
the
bye
is
so
extraordinary
that
i
know
some
people
who
have
lived
twenty
years
in
the
same
house
without
exchanging
one
word
with
their
neighbours
yet
provided
he
can
talk
sensibly
and
preserve
the
deportment
of
a
sober
gentleman
in
those
occasional
conversations
his
behaviour
will
be
the
more
remarkably
pleasing
as
it
will
agreeably
disappoint
the
expectation
of
the
person
who
had
entertained
notions
to
his
prejudice
when
a
foreigner
has
once
crossed
this
bar
which
perpetually
occurs
he
sails
without
further
difficulty
into
the
harbour
of
an
englishman
goodwill
for
the
pique
is
neither
personal
nor
rancorous
but
rather
contemptuous
and
national
so
that
while
he
despises
a
people
in
the
lump
an
individual
of
that
very
community
may
be
one
of
his
chief
favourites
the
english
are
in
general
upright
and
honest
therefore
unsuspecting
and
credulous
they
are
too
much
engrossed
with
their
own
business
to
pry
into
the
conduct
of
their
neighbours
and
too
indifferent
in
point
of
disposition
to
interest
themselves
in
what
they
conceive
to
be
foreign
to
their
own
concerns
they
are
wealthy
and
mercantile
of
consequence
liberal
and
adventurous
and
so
well
disposed
to
take
a
own
word
for
his
importance
that
they
suffer
themselves
to
be
preyed
upon
by
such
a
bungling
set
of
impostors
as
would
starve
for
lack
of
address
in
any
other
country
under
the
sun
this
being
a
true
sketch
of
the
british
character
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
observe
and
learn
you
will
easily
comprehend
the
profits
that
may
be
extracted
from
it
by
virtue
of
those
arts
by
which
you
so
eminently
excel
the
great
the
unbounded
prospect
lies
before
me
indeed
i
look
upon
this
opulent
kingdom
as
a
wide
and
fertile
common
on
which
we
adventurers
may
range
for
prey
without
let
or
molestation
for
so
jealous
are
the
natives
of
their
liberties
that
they
will
not
bear
the
restraint
of
necessary
police
and
an
able
artist
may
enrich
himself
with
their
spoils
without
running
any
risk
of
attracting
the
magistrate
or
incurring
the
least
penalty
of
the
law
in
a
word
this
metropolis
is
a
vast
masquerade
in
which
a
man
of
stratagem
may
wear
a
thousand
different
disguises
without
danger
of
detection
there
is
a
variety
of
shapes
in
which
we
the
knights
of
industry
make
our
appearance
in
london
one
glides
into
a
house
in
the
capacity
of
a
and
in
a
few
months
leads
the
whole
family
by
the
nose
another
exhibits
himself
to
the
public
as
an
empiric
or
operator
for
the
teeth
and
by
dint
of
assurance
and
affidavits
bearing
testimony
to
wonderful
cures
that
never
were
performed
whirls
himself
into
his
chariot
and
lays
the
town
under
contribution
a
third
professes
the
composition
of
music
as
well
as
the
performance
and
by
means
of
a
few
capriciosos
on
the
violin
properly
introduced
wriggles
himself
into
the
management
of
private
and
public
concerts
and
a
fourth
breaks
forth
at
once
in
all
the
splendour
of
a
gay
equipage
under
the
title
and
denomination
of
a
foreign
count
not
to
mention
those
inferior
projectors
who
assume
the
characters
of
dancers
and
french
ushers
or
by
renouncing
their
religion
seek
to
obtain
a
provision
for
life
either
of
these
parts
will
turn
to
the
account
of
an
able
actor
and
as
you
are
equally
qualified
for
all
you
may
choose
that
which
is
most
suitable
to
your
own
inclination
though
in
my
opinion
you
was
designed
by
nature
to
shine
in
the
great
world
which
after
all
is
the
most
ample
field
for
men
of
genius
because
the
game
is
deeper
and
people
of
fashion
being
for
the
most
part
more
ignorant
indolent
vain
and
capricious
than
their
inferiors
are
of
consequence
more
easily
deceived
besides
their
morals
sit
generally
so
loose
about
them
that
when
a
gentleman
of
our
fraternity
is
discovered
in
the
exercise
of
his
profession
their
contempt
of
his
skill
is
the
only
disgrace
he
incurs
our
hero
was
so
well
pleased
with
this
picture
that
he
longed
to
peruse
the
original
and
before
these
two
friends
parted
they
settled
all
the
operations
of
the
campaign
ratchcali
that
same
evening
hired
magnificent
lodgings
for
count
fathom
in
the
court
end
of
the
town
and
furnished
his
wardrobe
and
liveries
from
the
spoils
of
monmouth
street
he
likewise
enlisted
another
footman
and
into
his
service
and
sent
to
the
apartments
divers
large
trunks
supposed
to
be
filled
with
the
baggage
of
this
foreign
nobleman
though
in
reality
they
contained
little
else
than
common
lumber
next
day
our
adventurer
took
possession
of
his
new
habitation
after
having
left
to
his
friend
and
associate
the
task
of
dismissing
the
unfortunate
elenor
who
was
so
shocked
at
the
unexpected
message
that
she
fainted
away
and
when
she
recovered
the
use
of
her
senses
so
well
as
to
reflect
upon
her
forlorn
condition
she
was
seized
with
the
most
violent
transports
of
grief
and
dismay
by
which
her
brain
was
disordered
to
such
a
degree
that
she
grew
furious
and
distracted
and
was
by
the
advice
and
assistance
of
the
tyrolese
conveyed
into
the
hospital
of
bethlem
where
we
shall
leave
her
for
the
present
happily
bereft
of
her
reason
chapter
he
appears
in
the
great
world
with
universal
applause
and
admiration
meanwhile
fathom
and
his
engine
were
busied
in
completing
his
equipage
so
that
in
a
few
days
he
had
procured
a
very
gay
chariot
adorned
with
painting
gilding
and
a
coat
of
arms
according
to
his
own
fancy
and
direction
the
first
use
he
made
of
this
vehicle
was
that
of
visiting
the
young
nobleman
from
whom
he
had
received
such
important
civilities
on
the
road
in
consequence
of
an
invitation
at
parting
by
which
he
learned
his
title
and
the
place
of
his
abode
in
london
his
lordship
was
not
only
pleased
but
proud
to
see
such
a
stranger
at
his
gate
and
entertained
him
with
excess
of
complaisance
and
hospitality
insomuch
that
by
his
means
our
hero
soon
became
acquainted
with
the
whole
circle
of
polite
company
by
whom
he
was
caressed
for
his
insinuating
manners
and
agreeable
conversation
he
had
thought
proper
to
tell
the
nobleman
at
their
first
interview
in
town
that
his
reasons
for
concealing
his
knowledge
of
the
english
tongue
were
now
removed
and
that
he
would
no
longer
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
speaking
a
language
which
had
been
always
music
to
his
ear
he
had
also
thanked
his
lordship
for
his
generous
interposition
at
the
inn
which
was
an
instance
of
that
generosity
and
true
politeness
which
are
engrossed
by
the
english
people
who
leave
nought
to
other
nations
but
the
mere
shadow
of
these
virtues
a
testimony
like
this
from
the
mouth
of
such
a
noble
stranger
won
the
heart
of
the
peer
who
professed
a
friendship
for
him
on
the
spot
and
undertook
to
see
justice
done
to
his
lacquey
who
in
a
short
time
was
gratified
with
a
share
of
the
seizure
which
had
been
made
upon
his
information
amounting
to
fifty
or
sixty
pounds
ferdinand
put
not
forth
the
whole
strength
of
his
accomplishments
at
once
but
contrived
to
spring
a
new
mine
of
qualification
every
day
to
the
surprise
and
admiration
of
all
his
acquaintance
he
was
gifted
with
a
sort
of
elocution
much
more
specious
than
solid
and
spoke
on
every
subject
that
occurred
in
conversation
with
that
familiarity
and
ease
which
one
would
think
could
only
be
acquired
by
long
study
and
application
this
plausibility
and
confidence
are
faculties
really
inherited
from
nature
and
effectually
serve
the
possessor
in
lieu
of
that
learning
which
is
not
to
be
obtained
without
infinite
toil
and
perseverance
the
most
superficial
tincture
of
the
arts
and
sciences
in
such
a
juggler
is
sufficient
to
dazzle
the
understanding
of
half
mankind
and
if
managed
with
circumspection
will
enable
him
even
to
spend
his
life
among
the
literati
without
once
forfeiting
the
character
of
a
connoisseur
our
hero
was
perfectly
master
of
this
legerdemain
which
he
carried
to
such
a
pitch
of
assurance
as
to
declare
in
the
midst
of
a
mathematical
assembly
that
he
intended
to
gratify
the
public
with
a
full
confutation
of
sir
isaac
newton
philosophy
to
the
nature
of
which
he
was
as
much
a
stranger
as
the
most
savage
hottentot
in
africa
his
pretensions
to
profound
and
universal
knowledge
were
supported
not
only
by
this
kind
of
presumption
but
also
by
the
facility
with
which
he
spoke
so
many
different
languages
and
the
shrewd
remarks
he
had
made
in
the
course
of
his
travels
and
observation
among
politicians
he
settled
the
balance
of
power
upon
a
certain
footing
by
dint
of
ingenious
schemes
which
he
had
contrived
for
the
welfare
of
europe
with
officers
he
reformed
the
art
of
war
with
improvements
which
had
occurred
to
his
reflection
while
he
was
engaged
in
a
military
life
he
sometimes
held
forth
upon
painting
like
a
member
of
the
dilettanti
club
the
theory
of
music
was
a
theme
upon
which
he
seemed
to
expatiate
with
particular
pleasure
in
the
provinces
of
love
and
gallantry
he
was
a
perfect
oroondates
he
possessed
a
most
agreeable
manner
of
telling
entertaining
stories
of
which
he
had
a
large
collection
he
sung
with
great
melody
and
taste
and
played
upon
the
violin
with
surprising
execution
to
these
qualifications
let
us
add
his
affability
and
pliant
disposition
and
then
the
reader
will
not
wonder
that
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
pattern
of
human
perfection
and
his
acquaintance
courted
accordingly
while
he
thus
captivated
the
favour
and
affection
of
the
english
nobility
he
did
not
neglect
to
take
other
measures
in
behalf
of
the
partnership
to
which
he
had
subscribed
the
adventure
with
the
two
squires
at
paris
had
weakened
his
appetite
for
play
which
was
not
at
all
restored
by
the
observations
he
had
made
in
london
where
the
art
of
gaming
is
reduced
into
a
regular
system
and
its
professors
so
laudably
devoted
to
the
discharge
of
their
functions
as
to
observe
the
most
temperate
regimen
lest
their
invention
should
be
impaired
by
the
fatigue
of
watching
or
exercise
and
their
ideas
disturbed
by
the
fumes
of
indigestion
no
indian
brachman
could
live
more
abstemious
than
two
of
the
pack
who
hunted
in
couple
and
kennelled
in
the
upper
apartments
of
the
hotel
in
which
our
adventurer
lived
they
abstained
from
animal
food
with
the
abhorrence
of
pythagoreans
their
drink
was
a
pure
simple
element
they
were
vomited
once
a
week
took
physic
or
a
glyster
every
third
day
spent
the
forenoon
in
algebraical
calculations
and
slept
from
four
till
midnight
that
they
might
then
take
the
field
with
that
cool
serenity
which
is
the
effect
of
refreshment
and
repose
these
were
terms
upon
which
our
hero
would
not
risk
his
fortune
he
was
too
much
addicted
to
pleasure
to
forego
every
other
enjoyment
but
that
of
amassing
and
did
not
so
much
depend
upon
his
dexterity
in
play
as
upon
his
talent
of
insinuation
which
by
this
time
had
succeeded
so
far
beyond
his
expectation
that
he
began
to
indulge
the
hope
of
enslaving
the
heart
of
some
rich
heiress
whose
fortune
would
at
once
raise
him
above
all
dependence
indeed
no
man
ever
set
out
with
a
fairer
prospect
on
such
an
expedition
for
he
had
found
means
to
render
himself
so
agreeable
to
the
fair
sex
that
like
the
boxes
of
the
playhouse
during
the
representation
of
a
new
performance
his
company
was
often
bespoke
for
a
series
of
weeks
and
no
lady
whether
widow
wife
or
maiden
ever
mentioned
his
name
without
some
epithet
of
esteem
or
affection
such
as
the
dear
count
the
charming
man
the
nonpareil
or
the
angel
while
he
thus
shone
in
the
zenith
of
admiration
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
he
could
have
melted
some
wealthy
dowager
or
opulent
ward
but
being
an
enemy
to
all
precipitate
engagements
he
resolved
to
act
with
great
care
and
deliberation
in
an
affair
of
such
importance
especially
as
he
did
not
find
himself
hurried
by
the
importunities
of
want
for
since
his
arrival
in
england
he
had
rather
increased
than
exhausted
his
finances
by
methods
equally
certain
and
secure
in
a
word
he
with
the
assistance
of
ratchcali
carried
on
a
traffic
which
yielded
great
profits
without
subjecting
the
trader
to
the
least
loss
or
inconvenience
fathom
for
example
wore
upon
his
finger
a
large
brilliant
which
he
played
to
such
advantage
one
night
at
a
certain
nobleman
house
where
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
solo
on
the
violin
that
everybody
present
took
notice
of
its
uncommon
lustre
and
it
was
handed
about
for
the
perusal
of
every
individual
the
water
and
the
workmanship
were
universally
admired
and
one
among
the
rest
having
expressed
a
desire
of
knowing
the
value
of
such
a
jewel
the
count
seized
that
opportunity
of
entertaining
them
with
a
learned
disquisition
into
the
nature
of
stones
this
introduced
the
history
of
the
diamond
in
question
which
he
said
had
been
purchased
of
an
indian
trader
of
fort
george
at
an
under
price
so
that
the
present
proprietor
could
afford
to
sell
it
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
and
concluded
with
telling
the
company
that
for
his
own
part
he
had
been
importuned
to
wear
it
by
the
jeweller
who
imagined
it
would
have
a
better
chance
for
attracting
a
purchaser
on
his
finger
than
while
it
remained
in
his
own
custody
this
declaration
was
no
sooner
made
than
a
certain
lady
of
quality
bespoke
the
refuse
of
the
jewel
and
desired
ferdinand
to
send
the
owner
next
day
to
her
house
where
he
accordingly
waited
upon
her
ladyship
with
the
ring
for
which
he
received
one
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
of
the
sum
being
clear
gain
and
equally
divided
betwixt
the
associates
nor
was
this
bargain
such
as
reflected
dishonour
upon
the
lady
taste
or
could
be
productive
of
ill
consequences
to
the
merchant
for
the
method
of
estimating
diamonds
is
altogether
arbitrary
and
ratchcali
who
was
an
exquisite
lapidary
had
set
it
in
such
a
manner
as
would
have
imposed
upon
any
ordinary
jeweller
by
these
means
of
introduction
the
tyrolese
soon
monopolised
the
custom
of
a
great
many
noble
families
upon
which
he
levied
large
contributions
without
incurring
the
least
suspicion
of
deceit
he
every
day
out
of
pure
esteem
and
gratitude
for
the
honour
of
their
commands
entertained
them
with
the
sight
of
some
new
trinket
which
he
was
never
permitted
to
carry
home
unsold
and
from
the
profits
of
each
job
a
tax
was
raised
for
the
benefit
of
our
adventurer
yet
his
indultos
were
not
confined
to
the
article
of
jewels
which
constituted
only
one
part
of
his
revenue
by
the
industry
of
his
understrapper
he
procured
a
number
of
old
crazy
fiddles
which
were
thrown
aside
as
lumber
upon
which
he
counterfeited
the
cremona
mark
and
otherwise
cooked
them
up
with
great
dexterity
so
that
when
he
had
occasion
to
regale
the
lovers
of
music
he
would
send
for
one
of
these
vamped
instruments
and
extract
from
it
such
tones
as
quite
ravished
the
hearers
among
whom
there
was
always
some
conceited
pretender
who
spoke
in
raptures
of
the
violin
and
gave
our
hero
an
opportunity
of
launching
out
in
its
praise
and
declaring
it
was
the
best
cremona
he
had
ever
touched
this
encomium
never
failed
to
inflame
the
desires
of
the
audience
to
some
one
of
whom
he
was
generous
enough
to
part
with
it
at
prime
cost
that
is
for
twenty
or
thirty
guineas
clear
profit
for
he
was
often
able
to
oblige
his
friends
in
this
manner
because
being
an
eminent
connoisseur
his
countenance
was
solicited
by
all
the
musicians
who
wanted
to
dispose
of
such
moveables
nor
did
he
neglect
the
other
resources
of
a
skilful
virtuoso
every
auction
afforded
some
picture
in
which
though
it
had
been
overlooked
by
the
ignorance
of
the
times
he
recognised
the
style
of
a
great
master
and
made
a
merit
of
recommending
it
to
some
noble
friend
this
commerce
he
likewise
extended
to
medals
bronzes
busts
intaglios
and
old
china
and
kept
divers
artificers
continually
employed
in
making
antiques
for
the
english
nobility
thus
he
went
on
with
such
rapidity
of
success
in
all
his
endeavours
that
he
himself
was
astonished
at
the
infatuation
he
had
produced
nothing
was
so
wretched
among
the
productions
of
art
that
he
could
not
impose
upon
the
world
as
a
capital
performance
and
so
fascinated
were
the
eyes
of
his
admirers
he
could
easily
have
persuaded
them
that
a
barber
bason
was
an
etrurian
patera
and
the
cover
of
a
copper
pot
no
other
than
the
shield
of
ancus
martius
in
short
it
was
become
so
fashionable
to
consult
the
count
in
everything
relating
to
taste
and
politeness
that
not
a
plan
was
drawn
not
even
a
house
furnished
without
his
advice
and
approbation
nay
to
such
a
degree
did
his
reputation
in
these
matters
excel
that
a
particular
pattern
of
was
known
by
the
name
of
fathom
and
his
hall
was
every
morning
crowded
with
upholsterers
and
other
tradesmen
who
came
by
order
of
their
employers
to
learn
his
choice
and
take
his
directions
the
character
and
influence
he
thus
acquired
he
took
care
to
maintain
with
the
utmost
assiduity
and
circumspection
he
never
failed
to
appear
the
chief
personage
at
all
public
diversions
and
private
assemblies
not
only
in
conversation
and
dress
but
also
in
the
article
of
dancing
in
which
he
outstripped
all
his
fellows
as
far
as
in
every
other
genteel
accomplishment
chapter
he
attracts
the
envy
and
ill
offices
of
the
minor
knights
of
his
own
order
over
whom
he
obtains
a
complete
victory
such
a
could
not
be
enjoyed
without
exciting
the
malevolence
of
envy
and
detraction
in
the
propagation
of
which
none
were
so
industrious
as
the
brethren
of
his
own
order
who
had
like
him
made
a
descent
upon
this
island
and
could
not
without
repining
see
the
whole
harvest
in
the
hands
of
one
man
who
with
equal
art
and
discretion
avoided
all
intercourse
with
their
society
in
vain
they
strove
to
discover
his
pedigree
and
detect
the
particular
circumstances
of
his
life
and
conversation
all
their
inquiries
were
baffled
by
the
obscurity
of
his
origin
and
that
solitary
scheme
which
he
had
adopted
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
the
whole
fruit
of
their
investigation
amounted
to
no
more
than
a
certainty
that
there
was
no
family
of
any
consideration
in
europe
known
by
the
denomination
of
fathom
and
this
discovery
they
did
not
fail
to
divulge
for
the
benefit
of
our
adventurer
who
had
by
this
time
taken
such
firm
root
in
the
favour
of
the
great
as
to
set
all
those
little
arts
at
defiance
and
when
the
report
reached
his
ear
actually
made
his
friends
merry
with
the
conjectures
which
had
been
circulated
at
his
expense
his
adversaries
finding
themselves
disappointed
in
this
effort
held
a
consultation
to
devise
other
measures
against
him
and
came
to
a
resolution
of
ending
him
by
the
sword
or
rather
of
expelling
him
from
the
kingdom
by
the
fear
of
death
which
they
hoped
he
had
not
courage
enough
to
resist
because
his
deportment
had
always
been
remarkably
mild
and
pacific
it
was
upon
this
supposition
that
they
left
to
the
determination
of
the
dice
the
choice
of
the
person
who
should
execute
their
plan
and
the
lot
falling
upon
a
swiss
who
from
the
station
of
a
foot
soldier
in
the
dutch
service
out
of
which
he
had
been
drummed
for
theft
had
erected
himself
into
the
rank
of
a
chevalier
this
hero
fortified
himself
with
a
double
dose
of
brandy
and
betook
himself
to
a
certain
noted
with
an
intent
to
affront
count
fathom
in
public
he
was
lucky
enough
to
find
our
adventurer
sitting
at
a
table
in
conversation
with
some
persons
of
the
first
rank
upon
which
he
seated
himself
in
the
next
box
and
after
having
intruded
himself
into
their
discourse
which
happened
to
turn
upon
the
politics
of
some
german
courts
count
said
he
to
ferdinand
in
a
very
abrupt
and
disagreeable
manner
of
address
i
was
last
night
in
company
with
some
gentlemen
among
whom
a
dispute
happened
about
the
place
of
your
nativity
pray
what
country
are
you
of
sir
answered
the
other
with
great
politeness
i
at
present
have
the
honour
to
be
of
england
oho
replied
the
chevalier
i
ask
your
pardon
that
is
to
say
you
are
incog
some
people
may
find
it
convenient
to
keep
themselves
in
that
situation
true
said
the
count
but
some
people
are
too
well
known
to
enjoy
that
privilege
the
swiss
being
a
little
disconcerted
at
this
repartee
which
extracted
a
smile
from
the
audience
after
some
pause
observed
that
persons
of
a
certain
class
had
good
reason
to
drop
the
remembrance
of
what
they
have
been
but
a
good
citizen
will
not
forget
his
country
or
former
condition
and
a
bad
citizen
said
fathom
can
not
if
he
would
provided
he
has
met
with
his
deserts
a
sharper
may
as
well
forget
the
shape
of
a
die
or
a
discarded
soldier
the
sound
of
a
drum
as
the
chevalier
character
and
story
were
not
unknown
this
application
raised
an
universal
laugh
at
his
expense
which
provoked
him
to
such
a
degree
that
starting
up
he
swore
fathom
could
not
have
mentioned
any
object
in
nature
that
he
himself
resembled
so
much
as
a
drum
which
was
exactly
typified
by
his
emptiness
and
sound
with
this
difference
however
that
a
drum
was
never
noisy
till
beaten
whereas
the
count
would
never
be
quiet
until
he
should
have
undergone
the
same
discipline
so
saying
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
with
a
menacing
look
and
walked
out
as
if
in
expectation
of
being
followed
by
our
adventurer
who
suffered
himself
to
be
detained
by
the
company
and
very
calmly
took
notice
that
his
antagonist
would
not
be
ill
pleased
at
their
interposition
perhaps
he
would
not
have
comported
himself
with
such
ease
and
deliberation
had
not
he
made
such
remarks
upon
the
disposition
of
the
chevalier
as
convinced
him
of
his
own
safety
he
had
perceived
a
perplexity
and
perturbation
in
the
countenance
of
the
swiss
when
he
first
entered
the
his
blunt
and
precipitate
way
of
accosting
him
seemed
to
denote
confusion
and
compulsion
and
in
the
midst
of
his
ferocity
this
accurate
observer
discerned
the
trepidation
of
fear
by
the
help
of
these
signs
his
sagacity
soon
comprehended
the
nature
of
his
schemes
and
prepared
accordingly
for
a
formal
defiance
his
conjecture
was
verified
next
morning
by
a
visit
from
the
chevalier
who
taking
it
for
granted
that
fathom
would
not
face
an
adversary
in
the
field
because
he
had
not
followed
him
from
the
went
to
his
lodgings
with
great
confidence
and
demanded
to
see
the
count
upon
an
affair
that
would
admit
of
no
delay
maurice
according
to
his
instructions
told
him
that
his
master
was
gone
out
but
desired
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
repose
himself
in
the
parlour
till
the
return
which
he
expected
every
moment
ferdinand
who
had
taken
post
in
a
proper
place
for
observation
seeing
his
antagonist
fairly
admitted
took
the
same
road
and
appearing
before
him
wrapped
up
in
a
long
spanish
cloak
desired
to
know
what
had
procured
him
the
honour
of
such
an
early
visit
the
swiss
raising
his
voice
to
conceal
his
agitation
explained
his
errand
in
demanding
reparation
for
the
injury
his
honour
had
sustained
the
preceding
day
in
that
odious
allusion
to
a
scandalous
report
which
had
been
raised
by
the
malice
of
his
enemies
and
insisted
in
a
very
imperious
style
upon
his
attending
him
forthwith
to
the
nursery
in
hyde
park
have
a
little
patience
said
our
adventurer
with
great
composure
and
i
will
do
myself
the
pleasure
to
wait
upon
you
in
a
few
moments
with
these
words
he
rang
the
bell
and
calling
for
a
bason
of
water
laid
aside
his
cloak
and
displayed
himself
in
his
shirt
with
a
sword
in
his
right
hand
which
was
all
over
besmeared
with
recent
blood
as
if
he
had
just
come
from
the
slaughter
of
a
foe
this
phenomenon
made
such
an
impression
upon
the
astonished
chevalier
already
discomposed
by
the
resolute
behaviour
of
the
count
that
he
became
jaundiced
with
terror
and
dismay
and
while
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
told
our
hero
he
had
hoped
from
his
known
politeness
to
have
found
him
ready
to
acknowledge
an
injury
which
might
have
been
the
effect
of
anger
or
misapprehension
in
which
case
the
affair
might
have
been
compromised
to
their
mutual
satisfaction
without
proceeding
to
those
extremities
which
among
men
of
honour
are
always
accounted
the
last
resource
to
this
representation
ferdinand
answered
that
the
affair
had
been
of
the
chevalier
own
seeking
inasmuch
as
he
had
intruded
himself
into
his
company
and
treated
him
with
the
most
insolent
and
unprovoked
abuse
which
plainly
flowed
from
a
premeditated
design
against
his
honour
and
reputation
he
therefore
far
from
being
disposed
to
own
himself
in
the
wrong
would
not
even
accept
of
a
public
acknowledgment
from
him
the
aggressor
whom
he
looked
upon
as
an
infamous
sharper
and
was
resolved
to
chastise
accordingly
here
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
person
who
was
brought
to
the
door
in
a
chair
and
conducted
into
another
apartment
from
which
a
message
was
brought
to
the
count
importing
that
the
stranger
desired
to
speak
with
him
upon
business
of
the
last
importance
fathom
having
chid
the
servant
for
admitting
people
without
his
order
desired
the
swiss
to
excuse
him
for
a
minute
longer
and
went
in
to
the
next
room
from
whence
the
following
dialogue
was
overheard
by
this
challenger
count
said
the
stranger
you
are
not
ignorant
of
my
pretensions
to
the
heart
of
that
young
lady
at
whose
house
i
met
you
yesterday
therefore
you
can
not
be
surprised
when
i
declare
myself
displeased
with
your
visits
and
behaviour
to
my
mistress
and
demand
that
you
will
instantly
promise
to
drop
the
correspondence
else
what
follows
answered
ferdinand
with
a
cool
and
temperate
voice
my
resentment
and
immediate
defiance
replied
the
other
for
the
only
alternative
i
propose
is
to
forego
your
design
upon
that
lady
or
to
decide
our
pretension
by
the
sword
our
hero
having
expressed
a
regard
for
this
visitant
as
the
son
of
a
gentleman
whom
he
honoured
was
at
the
pains
to
represent
the
unreasonableness
of
his
demand
and
the
folly
of
his
presumption
and
earnestly
exhorted
him
to
put
the
issue
of
his
cause
upon
a
more
safe
and
equitable
footing
but
this
admonition
instead
of
appeasing
the
wrath
seemed
to
inflame
the
resentment
of
the
opponent
who
swore
he
would
not
leave
him
until
he
should
have
accomplished
the
purport
of
his
errand
in
vain
our
adventurer
requested
half
an
hour
for
the
despatch
of
some
urgent
business
in
which
he
was
engaged
with
a
gentleman
in
the
other
parlour
this
impetuous
rival
rejected
all
the
terms
he
could
propose
and
even
challenged
him
to
decide
the
controversy
upon
the
spot
an
expedient
to
which
the
other
having
assented
with
reluctance
the
door
was
secured
the
swords
unsheathed
and
a
hot
engagement
ensued
to
the
inexpressible
pleasure
of
the
swiss
who
did
not
doubt
that
he
himself
would
be
screened
from
all
danger
by
the
event
of
this
rencontre
nevertheless
his
hope
was
disappointed
in
the
defeat
of
the
stranger
who
was
quickly
disarmed
in
consequence
of
a
wound
through
the
upon
which
occasion
fathom
was
heard
to
say
that
in
consideration
of
his
youth
and
family
he
had
spared
his
life
but
he
would
not
act
with
the
same
tenderness
towards
any
other
antagonist
he
then
bound
up
the
limb
he
had
disabled
conducted
the
vanquished
party
to
his
chair
rejoined
the
chevalier
with
a
serene
countenance
and
asking
pardon
for
having
detained
him
so
long
proposed
they
should
instantly
set
out
in
a
for
the
place
of
appointment
the
stratagem
thus
conducted
had
all
the
success
the
inventor
could
desire
the
fear
of
the
swiss
had
risen
almost
to
an
ecstasy
before
the
count
quitted
the
room
but
after
this
sham
battle
which
had
been
preconcerted
betwixt
our
adventurer
and
his
friend
ratchcali
the
chevalier
terrors
were
unspeakable
he
considered
fathom
as
a
devil
incarnate
and
went
into
the
coach
as
a
malefactor
bound
for
tyburn
he
would
have
gladly
compounded
for
the
loss
of
a
leg
or
arm
and
entertained
some
transient
gleams
of
hope
that
he
should
escape
for
half
a
dozen
which
he
would
have
willingly
received
as
the
price
of
his
presumption
but
these
hopes
were
banished
by
the
remembrance
of
that
dreadful
declaration
which
he
had
heard
the
count
make
after
having
overcome
his
last
adversary
and
he
continued
under
the
power
of
the
most
unsupportable
panic
until
the
carriage
halted
at
hyde
park
corner
where
he
crawled
forth
in
a
most
piteous
and
lamentable
condition
so
that
when
they
reached
the
spot
he
was
scarce
able
to
stand
here
he
made
an
effort
to
speak
and
propose
an
accommodation
upon
a
new
plan
by
which
he
promised
to
leave
his
cause
to
the
arbitrement
of
those
gentlemen
who
were
present
at
the
rupture
and
to
ask
pardon
of
the
count
provided
he
should
be
found
guilty
of
a
trespass
upon
good
manners
but
this
proposal
would
not
satisfy
the
implacable
ferdinand
who
perceiving
the
agony
of
the
swiss
resolved
to
make
the
most
of
the
adventure
and
giving
him
to
understand
he
was
not
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
desired
him
to
draw
without
further
preamble
thus
compelled
the
unfortunate
gamester
pulled
off
his
coat
and
putting
himself
in
a
posture
to
use
the
words
of
nym
winked
and
held
out
his
cold
iron
our
adventurer
far
from
making
a
gentle
use
of
the
advantages
he
possessed
fiercely
attacked
him
while
he
was
incapable
of
making
resistance
and
aiming
at
a
fleshy
part
ran
him
through
the
arm
and
outside
of
the
shoulder
at
the
very
first
pass
the
chevalier
already
stupefied
with
the
horror
of
expectation
no
sooner
felt
his
point
in
his
body
than
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
concluding
he
was
no
longer
a
man
for
this
world
began
to
cross
himself
with
great
devotion
while
fathom
walked
home
deliberately
and
in
his
way
sent
a
couple
of
chairmen
to
the
assistance
of
the
wounded
knight
this
achievement
which
could
not
be
concealed
from
the
knowledge
of
the
public
not
only
furnished
the
character
of
fathom
with
fresh
wreaths
of
admiration
and
applause
but
likewise
effectually
secured
him
from
any
future
attempts
of
his
enemies
to
whom
the
swiss
for
his
own
sake
had
communicated
such
terrible
ideas
of
his
valour
as
overawed
the
whole
community
chapter
he
performs
another
exploit
that
conveys
a
true
idea
of
his
gratitude
and
honour
it
was
not
long
after
this
celebrated
victory
that
he
was
invited
to
spend
part
of
the
summer
at
the
house
of
a
country
gentleman
who
lived
about
one
hundred
miles
from
london
possessed
of
a
very
opulent
fortune
the
greatest
part
of
which
was
expended
in
acts
of
old
english
hospitality
he
had
met
with
our
hero
by
accident
at
the
table
of
a
certain
great
man
and
was
so
struck
with
his
manner
and
conversation
as
to
desire
his
acquaintance
and
cultivate
his
friendship
and
he
thought
himself
extremely
happy
in
having
prevailed
upon
him
to
pass
a
few
weeks
in
his
family
fathom
among
his
other
observations
perceived
that
there
was
a
domestic
uneasiness
occasioned
by
a
very
beautiful
young
creature
about
the
age
of
fifteen
who
resided
in
the
house
under
the
title
of
the
niece
though
she
was
in
reality
his
natural
daughter
born
before
his
marriage
this
circumstance
was
not
unknown
to
his
lady
by
whose
express
approbation
he
had
bestowed
particular
attention
upon
the
education
of
the
child
whom
we
shall
distinguish
by
the
name
of
celinda
their
liberality
in
this
particular
had
not
been
misapplied
for
she
not
only
gave
marks
of
uncommon
capacity
but
as
she
grew
up
became
more
and
more
amiable
in
her
person
and
was
now
returned
from
the
boarding
school
possessed
of
every
accomplishment
that
could
be
acquired
by
one
of
her
age
and
opportunities
these
qualifications
which
endeared
her
to
every
other
person
excited
the
jealousy
and
displeasure
of
her
supposed
aunt
who
could
not
bear
to
see
her
own
children
eclipsed
by
this
illegitimate
daughter
whom
she
therefore
discountenanced
upon
all
occasions
and
exposed
to
such
mortifications
as
would
in
all
appearance
drive
her
from
her
father
house
this
persecuting
spirit
was
very
disagreeable
to
the
husband
who
loved
celinda
with
a
truly
paternal
affection
and
produced
abundance
of
family
disquiet
but
being
a
man
of
a
peaceable
and
yielding
disposition
he
could
not
long
maintain
the
resolution
he
had
taken
in
her
favour
and
therefore
he
ceased
opposing
the
malevolence
of
his
wife
in
this
unfortunate
predicament
stood
the
fair
bastard
at
the
arrival
of
our
adventurer
who
being
allured
by
her
charms
apprised
of
her
situation
at
the
same
time
took
the
generous
resolution
to
undermine
her
innocence
that
he
might
banquet
his
vicious
appetite
with
the
spoils
of
her
beauty
perhaps
such
a
brutal
design
might
not
have
entered
his
imagination
if
he
had
not
observed
in
the
disposition
of
this
hapless
maiden
certain
peculiarities
from
which
he
derived
the
most
confident
presages
of
success
besides
a
total
want
of
experience
that
left
her
open
and
unguarded
against
the
attacks
of
the
other
sex
she
discovered
a
remarkable
spirit
of
credulity
and
superstitious
fear
which
had
been
cherished
by
the
conversation
of
her
she
was
particularly
fond
of
music
in
which
she
had
made
some
progress
but
so
delicate
was
the
texture
of
her
nerves
that
one
day
while
fathom
entertained
the
company
with
a
favourite
air
she
actually
swooned
with
pleasure
such
sensibility
our
projector
well
knew
must
be
diffused
through
all
the
passions
of
her
heart
he
congratulated
himself
upon
the
sure
ascendency
he
had
gained
over
her
in
this
particular
and
forthwith
began
to
execute
the
plan
he
had
erected
for
her
destruction
that
he
might
the
more
effectually
deceive
the
vigilance
of
her
father
wife
he
threw
such
a
dash
of
affectation
in
his
complaisance
towards
celinda
as
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
that
prying
matron
though
it
was
not
palpable
enough
to
disoblige
the
young
lady
herself
who
could
not
so
well
distinguish
between
overstrained
courtesy
and
real
good
breeding
this
behaviour
screened
him
from
the
suspicion
of
the
family
who
considered
it
as
an
effort
of
politeness
to
cover
his
indifference
and
disgust
for
the
daughter
of
his
friend
who
had
by
this
time
given
some
reason
to
believe
she
looked
upon
him
with
the
eyes
of
affection
so
that
the
opportunities
he
enjoyed
of
conversing
with
her
in
private
were
less
liable
to
intrusion
or
inquiry
indeed
from
what
i
have
already
observed
touching
the
sentiments
of
her
stepdame
that
lady
far
from
taking
measures
for
thwarting
our
hero
design
would
have
rejoiced
at
the
execution
of
it
and
had
she
been
informed
of
his
intent
might
have
fallen
upon
some
method
to
facilitate
the
enterprise
but
as
he
solely
depended
upon
his
own
talents
he
never
dreamed
of
soliciting
such
an
auxiliary
under
cover
of
instructing
and
accomplishing
her
in
the
exercise
of
music
he
could
not
want
occasions
for
promoting
his
aim
when
after
having
soothed
her
sense
of
hearing
even
to
a
degree
of
ravishment
so
as
to
extort
from
her
an
exclamation
importing
that
he
was
surely
something
supernatural
he
never
failed
to
whisper
some
insidious
compliment
or
tale
of
love
exquisitely
suited
to
the
emotions
of
her
soul
thus
was
her
heart
insensibly
subdued
though
more
than
half
his
work
was
still
undone
for
at
all
times
she
disclosed
such
purity
of
sentiment
such
inviolable
attachment
to
religion
and
virtue
and
seemed
so
averse
to
all
sorts
of
inflammatory
discourse
that
he
durst
not
presume
upon
the
footing
he
had
gained
in
her
affection
to
explain
the
baseness
of
his
desire
he
therefore
applied
to
another
of
her
passions
that
proved
the
bane
of
her
virtue
this
was
her
timidity
which
at
first
being
constitutional
was
afterwards
increased
by
the
circumstances
of
her
education
and
now
aggravated
by
the
artful
conversation
of
fathom
which
he
chequered
with
dismal
stories
of
omens
portents
prophecies
and
apparitions
delivered
upon
such
unquestionable
testimony
and
with
such
marks
of
conviction
as
captivated
the
belief
of
the
devoted
celinda
and
filled
her
imagination
with
unceasing
terrors
in
vain
she
strove
to
dispel
those
frightful
ideas
and
avoid
such
topics
of
discourse
for
the
future
the
more
she
endeavoured
to
banish
them
the
more
troublesome
they
became
and
such
was
her
infatuation
that
as
her
terrors
increased
her
thirst
after
that
sort
of
knowledge
was
augmented
many
sleepless
nights
did
she
pass
amidst
those
horrors
of
fancy
starting
at
every
noise
and
sweating
with
dreary
apprehension
yet
ashamed
to
own
her
fears
or
solicit
the
comfort
of
a
bedfellow
lest
she
should
incur
the
ridicule
and
censure
of
her
father
wife
and
what
rendered
this
disposition
the
more
irksome
was
the
solitary
situation
of
her
chamber
that
stood
at
the
end
of
a
long
gallery
scarce
within
hearing
of
any
other
inhabited
part
of
the
house
all
these
circumstances
had
been
duly
weighed
by
our
projector
who
having
prepared
celinda
for
his
purpose
stole
at
midnight
from
his
apartment
which
was
in
another
storey
and
approaching
her
door
there
uttered
a
piteous
groan
then
softly
retired
to
his
bed
in
full
confidence
of
seeing
next
day
the
effect
of
this
operation
nor
did
his
arrow
miss
the
mark
poor
celinda
countenance
gave
such
indications
of
melancholy
and
dismay
that
he
could
not
omit
asking
the
cause
of
her
disquiet
and
she
at
his
earnest
request
was
prevailed
upon
to
communicate
the
dreadful
salutation
of
the
preceding
night
which
she
considered
as
an
omen
of
death
to
some
person
of
the
family
in
all
probability
to
herself
as
the
groan
seemed
to
issue
from
one
corner
of
her
own
apartment
our
adventurer
argued
against
this
supposition
as
contradictory
to
the
common
observation
of
those
supernatural
warnings
which
are
not
usually
imparted
to
the
person
who
is
doomed
to
die
but
to
some
faithful
friend
or
trusty
servant
particularly
interested
in
the
event
he
therefore
supposed
that
the
groans
foreboded
the
death
of
my
lady
who
seemed
to
be
in
a
drooping
state
of
health
and
were
by
her
genius
conveyed
to
the
organs
of
celinda
who
was
the
chief
sufferer
by
her
jealous
and
barbarous
disposition
he
likewise
expressed
an
earnest
desire
to
be
an
of
such
solemn
communication
and
alleging
that
it
was
highly
improper
for
a
young
lady
of
her
delicate
feelings
to
expose
herself
alone
to
such
another
dismal
visitation
begged
he
might
be
allowed
to
watch
all
night
in
her
chamber
in
order
to
defend
her
from
the
shocking
impressions
of
fear
though
no
person
ever
stood
more
in
need
of
a
companion
or
guard
and
her
heart
throbbed
with
transports
of
dismay
at
the
prospect
of
night
she
rejected
his
proposal
with
due
acknowledgment
and
resolved
to
trust
solely
to
the
protection
of
heaven
not
that
she
thought
her
innocence
or
reputation
could
suffer
by
her
compliance
with
his
request
for
hitherto
her
heart
was
a
stranger
to
those
young
desires
which
haunt
the
fancy
and
warm
the
breast
of
youth
so
that
being
ignorant
of
her
danger
she
saw
not
the
necessity
of
avoiding
temptation
but
she
refused
to
admit
a
man
into
her
bedchamber
merely
because
it
was
a
step
altogether
opposite
to
the
forms
and
decorum
of
life
nevertheless
far
from
being
discouraged
by
this
repulse
he
knew
her
fears
would
multiply
and
reduce
that
reluctance
which
in
order
to
weaken
he
had
recourse
to
another
piece
of
machinery
that
operated
powerfully
in
behalf
of
his
design
some
years
ago
a
instrument
was
contrived
by
a
very
ingenious
musician
by
whom
it
was
aptly
entitled
the
harp
of
aeolus
because
being
properly
applied
to
a
stream
of
air
it
produces
a
wild
irregular
variety
of
harmonious
sounds
that
seem
to
be
the
effect
of
enchantment
and
wonderfully
dispose
the
mind
for
the
most
romantic
situations
fathom
who
was
really
a
virtuoso
in
music
had
brought
one
of
those
guitars
into
the
country
and
as
the
effect
of
it
was
still
unknown
in
the
family
he
that
night
converted
it
to
the
purposes
of
his
amour
by
fixing
it
in
the
casement
of
a
window
belonging
to
the
gallery
exposed
to
the
west
wind
which
then
blew
in
a
gentle
breeze
the
strings
no
sooner
felt
the
impression
of
the
balmy
zephyr
than
they
began
to
pour
forth
a
stream
of
melody
more
ravishingly
delightful
than
the
song
of
philomel
the
warbling
brook
and
all
the
concert
of
the
wood
the
soft
and
tender
notes
of
peace
and
love
were
swelled
up
with
the
most
delicate
and
insensible
transition
into
a
loud
hymn
of
triumph
and
exultation
joined
by
the
organ
and
a
full
choir
of
voices
which
gradually
decayed
upon
the
ear
until
it
died
away
in
distant
sound
as
if
a
flight
of
angels
had
raised
the
song
in
their
ascent
to
heaven
yet
the
chords
hardly
ceased
to
vibrate
after
the
expiration
of
this
overture
which
ushered
in
a
composition
in
the
same
pathetic
style
and
this
again
was
succeeded
by
a
third
almost
without
pause
or
intermission
as
if
the
artist
hand
had
been
indefatigable
and
the
theme
never
to
be
exhausted
his
heart
must
be
quite
callous
and
his
ear
lost
to
all
distinction
who
could
hear
such
harmony
without
emotion
how
deeply
then
must
it
have
affected
the
delicate
celinda
whose
sensations
naturally
acute
were
whetted
to
a
most
painful
keenness
by
her
apprehension
who
could
have
no
previous
idea
of
such
entertainment
and
was
credulous
enough
to
believe
the
most
improbable
tale
of
superstition
she
was
overwhelmed
with
awful
terror
and
never
doubting
that
the
sounds
were
more
than
mortal
recommended
herself
to
the
care
of
providence
in
a
succession
of
pious
ejaculations
our
adventurer
having
allowed
some
time
for
the
effect
of
this
contrivance
repaired
to
her
chamber
door
and
in
a
whisper
conveyed
through
the
keyhole
asked
if
she
was
awake
begged
pardon
for
such
an
unseasonable
visit
and
desired
to
know
her
opinion
of
the
strange
music
which
he
then
heard
in
spite
of
her
notions
of
decency
she
was
glad
of
his
intrusion
and
being
in
no
condition
to
observe
punctilios
slipped
on
a
wrapper
opened
the
door
and
with
a
faltering
voice
owned
herself
frightened
almost
to
distraction
he
pretended
to
console
her
with
reflections
importing
that
she
was
in
the
hands
of
a
benevolent
being
who
would
not
impose
upon
his
creatures
any
task
which
they
could
not
bear
he
insisted
upon
her
returning
to
bed
and
assured
her
he
would
not
stir
from
her
chamber
till
day
thus
comforted
she
betook
herself
again
to
rest
while
he
sat
down
in
an
at
some
distance
from
the
bedside
and
in
a
soft
voice
began
the
conversation
with
her
on
the
subject
of
those
visitations
from
above
which
though
undertaken
on
pretence
of
dissipating
her
fear
and
anxiety
was
in
reality
calculated
for
the
purpose
of
augmenting
both
that
sweet
air
said
he
seems
designed
for
soothing
the
bodily
anguish
of
some
saint
in
his
last
moments
hark
how
it
rises
into
a
more
sprightly
and
elevated
strain
as
if
it
were
an
inspiriting
invitation
to
the
realms
of
bliss
sure
he
is
now
absolved
from
all
the
misery
of
this
life
that
full
and
glorious
concert
of
voices
and
celestial
harps
betoken
his
reception
among
the
heavenly
choir
who
now
waft
his
soul
to
paradisian
joys
this
is
altogether
great
solemn
and
amazing
the
clock
strikes
one
the
symphony
hath
ceased
this
was
actually
the
case
for
he
had
ordered
maurice
to
remove
the
instrument
at
that
hour
lest
the
sound
of
it
should
become
too
familiar
and
excite
the
curiosity
of
some
undaunted
domestic
who
might
frustrate
his
scheme
by
discovering
the
apparatus
as
for
poor
celinda
her
fancy
was
by
his
music
and
discourse
worked
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
enthusiastic
terrors
the
whole
bed
shook
with
her
trepidation
the
awful
silence
that
succeeded
the
supernatural
music
threw
an
additional
damp
upon
her
spirits
and
the
artful
fathom
affecting
to
snore
at
the
same
time
she
could
no
longer
contain
her
horror
but
called
upon
his
name
with
a
fearful
accent
and
having
owned
her
present
situation
insupportable
entreated
him
to
draw
near
her
bedside
that
he
might
be
within
touch
on
any
emergency
this
was
a
welcome
request
to
our
adventurer
who
asking
pardon
for
his
drowsiness
and
taking
his
station
on
the
side
of
her
bed
exhorted
her
to
compose
herself
then
locking
her
hand
fast
in
his
own
was
again
seized
with
such
an
inclination
to
sleep
that
he
gradually
sunk
down
by
her
side
and
seemed
to
enjoy
his
repose
in
that
attitude
meanwhile
his
mistress
that
he
might
not
suffer
in
his
health
by
his
humanity
and
complaisance
covered
him
with
the
counterpane
as
he
slept
and
suffered
him
to
take
his
rest
without
interruption
till
he
thought
proper
to
start
up
suddenly
with
an
exclamation
of
heaven
watch
over
us
and
then
asked
with
symptoms
of
astonishment
if
she
had
heard
nothing
such
an
abrupt
address
upon
such
an
occasion
did
not
fail
to
amaze
and
affright
the
gentle
celinda
who
unable
to
speak
sprung
towards
her
treacherous
protector
and
he
catching
her
in
his
arms
bade
her
fear
nothing
for
he
would
at
the
expense
of
his
life
defend
her
from
all
danger
having
thus
by
tampering
with
her
weakness
conquered
the
first
and
chief
obstacles
to
his
design
he
with
great
art
and
perseverance
improved
the
intercourse
to
such
a
degree
of
intimacy
as
could
not
but
be
productive
of
all
the
consequences
which
he
had
foreseen
the
groans
and
music
were
occasionally
repeated
so
as
to
alarm
the
whole
family
and
inspire
a
thousand
various
conjectures
he
failed
not
to
continue
his
nocturnal
visits
and
ghastly
discourse
until
his
attendance
became
so
necessary
to
this
unhappy
maiden
that
she
durst
not
stay
in
her
own
chamber
without
his
company
nor
even
sleep
except
in
contact
with
her
betrayer
such
a
commerce
between
two
such
persons
of
a
different
sex
could
not
possibly
be
long
carried
on
without
degenerating
from
the
platonic
system
of
sentimental
love
in
her
paroxysms
of
dismay
he
did
not
forget
to
breathe
the
soft
inspirations
of
his
passion
to
which
she
listened
with
more
pleasure
as
they
diverted
the
gloomy
ideas
of
her
fear
and
by
this
time
his
extraordinary
accomplishments
had
made
a
conquest
of
her
heart
what
therefore
could
be
a
more
interesting
transition
than
that
from
the
most
uneasy
to
the
most
agreeable
sensation
of
the
human
breast
this
being
the
case
the
reader
will
not
wonder
that
a
consummate
traitor
like
fathom
should
triumph
over
the
virtue
of
an
artless
innocent
young
creature
whose
passions
he
had
entirely
under
his
command
the
gradations
towards
vice
are
almost
imperceptible
and
an
experienced
seducer
can
strew
them
with
such
enticing
and
agreeable
flowers
as
will
lead
the
young
sinner
on
insensibly
even
to
the
most
profligate
stages
of
guilt
all
therefore
that
can
be
done
by
virtue
unassisted
with
experience
is
to
avoid
every
trial
with
such
a
formidable
foe
by
declining
and
discouraging
the
first
advances
towards
a
particular
correspondence
with
perfidious
man
howsoever
agreeable
it
may
seem
to
be
for
here
is
no
security
but
in
conscious
weakness
fathom
though
possessed
of
the
spoils
of
poor
celinda
honour
did
not
enjoy
his
success
with
tranquillity
reflection
and
remorse
often
invaded
her
in
the
midst
of
their
guilty
pleasures
and
embittered
all
those
moments
they
had
dedicated
to
mutual
bliss
for
the
seeds
of
virtue
are
seldom
destroyed
at
once
even
amidst
the
rank
productions
of
vice
they
regerminate
to
a
sort
of
imperfect
vegetation
like
some
scattered
hyacinths
shooting
up
among
the
weeds
of
a
ruined
garden
that
testify
the
former
culture
and
amenity
of
the
soil
she
sighed
at
the
sad
remembrance
of
that
virgin
dignity
which
she
had
lost
she
wept
at
the
prospect
of
that
disgrace
mortification
and
misery
she
should
undergo
when
abandoned
by
this
transient
lover
and
severely
reproached
him
for
the
arts
he
had
used
to
shipwreck
her
innocence
and
peace
such
expostulations
are
extremely
unseasonable
when
addressed
to
a
man
sated
with
the
effects
of
his
conquest
they
act
like
strong
blasts
of
wind
applied
to
embers
almost
extinguished
which
instead
of
reviving
the
flame
scatter
and
destroy
every
remaining
particle
of
fire
our
adventurer
in
the
midst
of
his
peculiarities
had
inconstancy
in
common
with
the
rest
of
his
sex
more
than
half
cloyed
with
the
possession
of
celinda
he
could
not
fail
to
be
disgusted
with
her
upbraidings
and
had
she
not
been
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
whose
friendship
he
did
not
think
it
his
interest
to
forfeit
he
would
have
dropped
this
correspondence
without
reluctance
or
hesitation
but
as
he
had
measures
to
keep
with
a
family
of
such
consequence
he
constrained
his
inclinations
so
far
as
to
counterfeit
those
raptures
he
no
longer
felt
and
found
means
to
appease
those
intervening
tumults
of
her
grief
foreseeing
however
that
it
would
not
be
always
in
his
power
to
console
her
on
these
terms
he
resolved
if
possible
to
divide
her
affection
which
now
glowed
upon
him
too
intensely
and
with
that
view
whenever
she
complained
of
the
vapours
or
dejection
he
prescribed
and
even
insisted
upon
her
swallowing
certain
cordials
of
the
most
palatable
composition
without
which
he
never
travelled
and
these
produced
such
agreeable
reveries
and
flow
of
spirits
that
she
gradually
became
enamoured
of
intoxication
while
he
encouraged
the
pernicious
passion
by
expressing
the
most
extravagant
applause
and
admiration
at
the
wild
irregular
sallies
it
produced
without
having
first
made
this
diversion
he
would
have
found
it
impracticable
to
leave
the
house
with
tranquillity
but
when
this
bewitching
philtre
grew
into
an
habit
her
attachment
to
ferdinand
was
insensibly
dissolved
she
began
to
bear
his
neglect
with
indifference
and
sequestering
herself
from
the
rest
of
the
family
used
to
solicit
this
new
ally
for
consolation
having
thus
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
the
daughter
ruin
he
took
leave
of
the
father
with
many
acknowledgments
and
expressions
of
gratitude
for
his
hospitality
and
friendship
and
riding
across
the
country
to
bristol
took
up
his
habitation
near
the
hot
well
where
he
stayed
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
season
as
for
the
miserable
celinda
she
became
more
and
more
addicted
to
the
vices
in
which
she
had
been
initiated
by
his
superlative
perfidy
and
craft
until
she
was
quite
abandoned
by
decency
and
caution
her
father
heart
was
torn
with
anguish
while
his
wife
rejoiced
in
her
fall
at
length
her
ideas
were
quite
debased
by
her
infirmity
she
grew
every
day
more
and
more
sensual
and
degenerate
and
contracted
an
intimacy
with
one
of
the
footmen
who
was
kind
enough
to
take
her
to
wife
in
hope
of
obtaining
a
good
settlement
from
his
master
but
being
disappointed
in
his
aim
he
conducted
her
to
london
where
he
made
shift
to
insinuate
himself
into
another
service
leaving
her
to
the
use
and
partly
the
advantage
of
her
own
person
which
was
still
uncommonly
attractive
chapter
he
repairs
to
bristol
spring
where
he
reigns
paramount
during
the
whole
season
we
shall
therefore
leave
her
in
this
comfortable
situation
and
return
to
our
adventurer
whose
appearance
at
bristol
was
considered
as
a
happy
omen
by
the
proprietor
of
the
hot
well
and
all
the
people
who
live
by
the
resort
of
company
to
that
celebrated
spring
nor
were
they
deceived
in
their
prognostic
fathom
as
usual
formed
the
nucleus
or
kernel
of
the
beau
monde
and
the
season
soon
became
so
crowded
that
many
people
of
fashion
were
obliged
to
quit
the
place
for
want
of
lodging
ferdinand
was
the
soul
that
animated
the
whole
society
he
not
only
invented
parties
of
pleasure
but
also
by
his
personal
talents
rendered
them
more
agreeable
in
a
word
he
regulated
their
diversions
and
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
never
would
allow
the
ball
to
be
begun
till
the
count
was
seated
having
thus
made
himself
the
object
of
admiration
and
esteem
his
advice
was
an
oracle
to
which
they
had
recourse
in
all
doubtful
cases
of
punctilio
or
dispute
or
even
of
medicine
for
among
his
other
accomplishments
his
discourse
on
that
subject
was
so
plausible
and
well
adapted
to
the
understanding
of
his
hearers
that
any
person
who
had
not
actually
studied
the
medical
art
would
have
believed
he
was
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
aesculapius
what
contributed
to
the
aggrandisement
of
his
character
in
this
branch
of
knowledge
was
a
victory
he
obtained
over
an
old
physician
who
plied
at
the
well
and
had
one
day
unfortunately
begun
to
harangue
in
the
upon
the
nature
of
the
bristol
water
in
the
course
of
this
lecture
he
undertook
to
account
for
the
warmth
of
the
fluid
and
his
ideas
being
perplexed
with
a
great
deal
of
reading
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
digest
his
disquisition
was
so
indistinct
and
his
expression
so
obscure
and
unentertaining
that
our
hero
seized
the
opportunity
of
displaying
his
own
erudition
by
venturing
to
contradict
some
circumstances
of
the
doctor
hypothesis
and
substituting
a
theory
of
his
own
which
as
he
had
invented
it
for
the
purpose
was
equally
amusing
and
chimerical
he
alleged
that
fire
was
the
sole
vivifying
principle
that
pervaded
all
nature
that
as
the
heat
of
the
sun
concocted
the
juice
of
vegetables
and
ripened
those
fruits
that
grow
upon
the
surface
of
this
globe
there
was
likewise
an
immense
store
of
central
fire
reserved
within
the
bowels
of
the
earth
not
only
for
the
generation
of
gems
fossils
and
all
the
purposes
of
the
mineral
world
but
likewise
for
cherishing
and
keeping
alive
those
plants
which
would
otherwise
perish
by
the
winter
cold
the
existence
of
such
a
fire
he
proved
from
the
nature
of
all
those
volcanoes
which
in
almost
every
corner
of
the
earth
are
continually
vomiting
up
either
flames
or
smoke
these
said
he
are
the
great
vents
appointed
by
nature
for
the
discharge
of
that
rarefied
air
and
combustible
matter
which
if
confined
would
burst
the
globe
asunder
but
besides
the
larger
outlets
there
are
some
small
chimneys
through
which
part
of
the
heat
transpires
a
vapour
of
that
sort
i
conceive
must
pass
through
the
bed
or
channel
of
this
spring
the
waters
of
which
accordingly
retain
a
moderate
warmth
this
account
which
totally
overthrew
the
other
doctrine
was
so
extremely
agreeable
to
the
audience
that
the
testy
doctor
lost
his
temper
and
gave
them
to
understand
without
preamble
that
he
must
be
a
person
wholly
ignorant
of
natural
philosophy
who
could
invent
such
a
ridiculous
system
and
they
involved
in
worse
than
an
egyptian
fog
that
could
not
at
once
discern
its
weakness
and
absurdity
this
declaration
introduced
a
dispute
which
was
unanimously
determined
in
favour
of
our
adventurer
on
all
such
occasions
the
stream
of
prejudice
runs
against
the
physician
even
though
his
antagonist
has
nothing
to
recommend
himself
to
the
favour
of
the
spectators
and
this
decision
depends
upon
divers
considerations
in
the
first
place
there
is
a
continual
war
carried
on
against
the
learned
professions
by
all
those
who
conscious
of
their
own
ignorance
seek
to
level
the
reputation
of
their
superiors
with
their
own
secondly
in
all
disputes
upon
physic
that
happen
betwixt
a
person
who
really
understands
the
art
and
an
illiterate
pretender
the
arguments
of
the
first
will
seem
obscure
and
unintelligible
to
those
who
are
unacquainted
with
the
previous
systems
on
which
they
are
built
while
the
other
theory
derived
from
common
notions
and
superficial
observation
will
be
more
agreeable
because
better
adapted
to
the
comprehension
of
the
hearers
thirdly
the
judgment
of
the
multitude
is
apt
to
be
biassed
by
that
surprise
which
is
the
effect
of
seeing
an
artist
foiled
at
his
own
weapons
by
one
who
engages
him
only
for
amusement
fathom
besides
these
advantages
was
blessed
with
a
flow
of
language
an
elegant
address
a
polite
and
style
of
argumentation
together
with
a
temper
not
to
be
ruffled
so
that
the
victory
could
not
long
waver
between
him
and
the
physician
to
whom
he
was
infinitely
superior
in
every
acquisition
but
that
of
solid
learning
of
which
the
judges
had
no
idea
this
contest
was
not
only
glorious
but
profitable
to
our
adventurer
who
grew
into
such
request
in
his
medical
capacity
that
the
poor
doctor
was
utterly
deserted
by
his
patients
and
fathom
advice
solicited
by
every
valetudinarian
in
the
place
nor
did
he
forfeit
the
character
he
thus
acquired
by
any
miscarriages
in
his
practice
being
but
little
conversant
with
the
materia
medica
the
circle
of
his
prescriptions
was
very
small
his
chief
study
was
to
avoid
all
drugs
of
rough
operation
and
uncertain
effect
and
to
administer
such
only
as
should
be
agreeable
to
the
palate
without
doing
violence
to
the
constitution
such
a
physician
could
not
but
be
agreeable
to
people
of
all
dispositions
and
as
most
of
the
patients
were
in
some
shape
hypochondriac
the
power
of
imagination
with
his
remedies
often
effected
a
cure
on
the
whole
it
became
the
fashion
to
consult
the
count
in
all
distempers
and
his
reputation
would
have
had
its
run
though
the
death
of
every
patient
had
given
the
lie
to
his
pretensions
but
empty
fame
was
not
the
sole
fruit
of
his
success
though
no
person
would
presume
to
affront
this
noble
graduate
with
a
fee
they
did
not
fail
to
manifest
their
gratitude
by
some
more
valuable
present
every
day
some
superb
piece
of
china
curious
snuffbox
or
jewel
was
pressed
upon
him
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
could
almost
have
furnished
a
toyshop
with
the
acknowledgments
he
had
received
not
only
his
avarice
but
his
pleasure
was
gratified
in
the
course
of
his
medical
administration
he
enjoyed
free
access
egress
and
regress
with
all
the
females
at
the
well
and
no
matron
scrupled
to
put
her
daughter
under
his
care
and
direction
these
opportunities
could
not
be
lost
upon
a
man
of
his
intriguing
genius
though
he
conducted
his
amours
with
such
discretion
that
during
the
whole
season
no
lady
character
suffered
on
his
account
yet
he
was
highly
fortunate
in
his
addresses
and
we
may
venture
to
affirm
that
the
reproach
of
barrenness
was
more
than
once
removed
by
the
vigour
of
his
endeavours
chapter
he
is
smitten
with
the
charms
of
a
female
adventurer
whose
allurements
subject
him
to
a
new
vicissitude
of
fortune
among
those
who
were
distinguished
by
his
gallantry
was
the
young
wife
of
an
old
citizen
of
london
who
had
granted
her
permission
to
reside
at
the
hot
well
for
the
benefit
of
her
health
under
the
eye
and
inspection
of
his
own
sister
who
was
a
maiden
of
fifty
years
the
pupil
whose
name
was
trapwell
though
low
in
stature
was
finely
shaped
her
countenance
engaging
though
her
complexion
was
brown
her
hair
in
colour
rivalled
the
raven
back
and
her
eyes
emulated
the
lustre
of
the
diamond
fathom
had
been
struck
with
her
first
appearance
but
found
it
impracticable
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
her
duenna
so
as
to
make
a
declaration
of
his
flame
until
she
herself
guessing
the
situation
of
his
thoughts
and
not
displeased
with
the
discovery
thought
proper
to
furnish
him
with
the
opportunity
he
wanted
by
counterfeiting
an
indisposition
for
the
cure
of
which
she
knew
his
advice
would
be
implored
this
was
the
beginning
of
an
acquaintance
which
was
soon
improved
to
his
wish
and
so
well
did
she
manage
her
attractions
as
in
some
measure
to
fix
the
inconstancy
of
his
disposition
for
at
the
end
of
the
season
his
passion
was
not
sated
and
they
concerted
the
means
of
continuing
their
commerce
even
after
their
return
to
london
this
intercourse
effectually
answered
the
purpose
of
the
husband
who
had
been
decoyed
into
matrimony
by
the
cunning
of
his
spouse
whom
he
had
privately
kept
as
a
concubine
before
marriage
conscious
of
her
own
precarious
situation
she
had
resolved
to
impose
upon
the
infirmities
of
trapwell
and
feigning
herself
pregnant
gave
him
to
understand
she
could
no
longer
conceal
her
condition
from
the
knowledge
of
her
brother
who
was
an
officer
in
the
army
and
of
such
violent
passions
that
should
he
once
discover
her
backsliding
he
would
undoubtedly
wipe
away
the
stains
of
his
family
dishonour
with
her
own
blood
as
well
as
that
of
her
keeper
the
citizen
to
prevent
such
a
catastrophe
took
her
to
wife
but
soon
after
perceiving
the
trick
which
had
been
played
upon
him
set
his
invention
at
work
and
at
length
contrived
a
scheme
which
he
thought
would
enable
him
not
only
to
retrieve
his
liberty
but
also
indemnify
himself
for
the
mortification
he
had
undergone
far
from
creating
any
domestic
disturbance
by
upbraiding
her
with
her
finesse
he
seemed
perfectly
well
pleased
with
his
acquisition
and
as
he
knew
her
void
of
any
principle
and
extremely
addicted
to
pleasure
he
chose
proper
occasions
to
insinuate
that
she
might
gratify
her
own
inclination
and
at
the
same
time
turn
her
beauty
to
good
account
she
joyfully
listened
to
these
remonstrances
and
in
consequence
of
their
mutual
agreement
she
repaired
to
bristol
spring
on
pretence
of
an
ill
state
of
health
accompanied
by
her
whom
they
did
not
think
proper
to
intrust
with
the
real
motive
of
her
journey
person
was
agreeable
and
his
finances
supposed
to
be
in
flourishing
order
therefore
she
selected
him
from
the
herd
of
gallants
as
a
proper
sacrifice
to
the
powers
which
she
adored
and
on
her
arrival
in
london
made
her
husband
acquainted
with
the
importance
of
her
conquest
trapwell
overwhelmed
her
with
caresses
and
praise
for
her
discreet
and
dutiful
conduct
and
faithfully
promised
that
she
should
pocket
in
her
own
privy
purse
of
the
spoils
that
should
be
gathered
from
her
gallant
whom
she
therefore
undertook
to
betray
after
he
had
swore
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
his
intention
was
not
to
bring
the
affair
to
a
public
trial
which
would
redound
to
his
own
disgrace
but
to
extort
a
round
sum
of
money
from
the
count
by
way
of
composition
confiding
in
this
protestation
she
in
a
few
days
gave
him
intelligence
of
an
assignation
she
had
made
with
our
adventurer
at
a
certain
bagnio
near
covent
garden
upon
which
he
secured
the
assistance
of
a
particular
friend
and
his
own
journeyman
with
whom
and
a
constable
he
repaired
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
where
he
waited
in
an
adjoining
room
according
to
the
directions
of
his
virtuous
spouse
until
she
made
the
preconcerted
signal
of
hemming
three
times
aloud
when
he
and
his
associates
rushed
into
the
chamber
and
surprised
our
hero
in
bed
with
his
inamorata
the
lady
on
this
occasion
acted
her
part
to
a
miracle
she
screamed
at
their
approach
and
after
an
exclamation
of
ruined
and
undone
fainted
away
in
the
arms
of
her
spouse
who
had
by
this
time
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
and
begun
to
upbraid
her
with
her
infidelity
and
guilt
as
for
fathom
his
affliction
was
unutterable
when
he
found
himself
discovered
in
that
situation
and
made
prisoner
by
the
two
assistants
who
had
pinioned
him
in
such
a
manner
that
he
could
not
stir
much
less
accomplish
an
escape
all
his
ingenuity
and
presence
of
mind
seemed
to
forsake
him
in
this
emergency
the
horrors
of
an
english
jury
overspread
his
imagination
for
he
at
once
perceived
that
the
toil
into
which
he
had
fallen
was
laid
for
the
purpose
consequently
he
took
it
for
granted
that
there
would
be
no
deficiency
in
point
of
evidence
soon
as
he
recollected
himself
he
begged
that
no
violence
might
be
offered
to
his
person
and
entreated
the
husband
to
favour
him
with
a
conference
in
which
the
affair
might
be
compromised
without
prejudice
to
the
reputation
of
either
at
first
trapwell
breathed
nothing
but
implacable
revenge
but
by
the
persuasion
of
his
friends
after
he
had
sent
home
his
wife
in
a
chair
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
hear
the
proposals
of
the
delinquent
who
having
assured
him
by
way
of
apology
that
he
had
always
believed
the
lady
was
a
widow
made
him
an
offer
of
five
hundred
pounds
as
an
atonement
for
the
injury
he
had
sustained
this
being
a
sum
no
ways
adequate
to
the
expectation
of
the
citizen
who
looked
upon
the
count
as
possessor
of
an
immense
estate
he
rejected
the
terms
with
disdain
and
made
instant
application
to
a
judge
from
whom
he
obtained
a
warrant
for
securing
his
person
till
the
day
of
trial
indeed
in
this
case
money
was
but
a
secondary
consideration
with
trapwell
whose
chief
aim
was
to
be
legally
divorced
from
a
woman
he
detested
therefore
there
was
no
remedy
for
the
unhappy
count
who
in
vain
offered
to
double
the
sum
he
found
himself
reduced
to
the
bitter
alternative
of
procuring
immediate
bail
or
going
directly
to
newgate
in
this
dilemma
he
sent
a
messenger
to
his
friend
ratchcali
whose
countenance
fell
when
he
understood
the
count
condition
nor
would
he
open
his
mouth
in
the
style
of
consolation
until
he
had
consulted
a
certain
solicitor
of
his
acquaintance
who
assured
him
the
law
abounded
with
such
resources
as
would
infallibly
screen
the
defendant
had
the
fact
been
still
more
palpable
than
it
was
he
said
there
was
great
presumption
to
believe
the
count
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
a
conspiracy
which
by
some
means
or
other
would
be
detected
and
in
that
case
the
plaintiff
might
obtain
one
shilling
in
lieu
of
damages
if
that
dependence
should
fail
he
hinted
that
in
all
probability
the
witnesses
were
not
incorruptible
or
should
they
prove
to
be
so
one
man
oath
was
as
good
as
another
and
thank
heaven
there
was
no
dearth
of
evidence
provided
money
could
be
found
to
answer
the
necessary
occasions
ratchcali
comforted
by
these
insinuations
and
dreading
the
resentment
of
our
adventurer
who
in
his
despair
might
punish
him
severely
for
his
want
of
friendship
by
some
precipitate
explanation
of
the
commerce
they
had
carried
on
moved
i
say
by
these
considerations
and
moreover
tempted
with
the
prospect
of
continuing
to
reap
the
advantages
resulting
from
their
conjunction
he
and
another
person
of
credit
with
whom
he
largely
dealt
in
jewels
condescended
to
become
sureties
for
the
appearance
of
fathom
who
was
accordingly
admitted
to
bail
not
but
that
the
tyrolese
knew
ferdinand
too
well
to
confide
in
his
parole
he
depended
chiefly
upon
his
ideas
of
which
he
thought
would
persuade
him
to
risk
the
uncertain
issue
of
a
trial
rather
than
quit
the
field
before
the
harvest
was
half
over
and
he
was
resolved
to
make
his
own
retreat
without
ceremony
should
our
hero
be
unwise
enough
to
abandon
his
bail
such
an
adventure
could
not
long
lie
concealed
from
the
notice
of
the
public
even
if
both
parties
had
been
at
pains
to
suppress
the
circumstances
but
the
plaintiff
far
from
seeking
to
cover
affected
to
complain
loudly
of
his
misfortune
that
he
might
interest
his
neighbours
in
his
behalf
and
raise
a
spirit
of
rancour
and
animosity
to
influence
the
jury
against
this
insolent
foreigner
who
had
come
over
into
england
to
debauch
our
wives
and
deflower
our
daughters
while
he
employed
a
formidable
band
of
lawyers
to
support
the
indictment
which
he
laid
at
ten
thousand
pounds
damages
meanwhile
fathom
and
his
associate
did
not
fail
to
take
all
proper
measures
for
his
defence
they
retained
a
powerful
bar
of
counsel
and
the
solicitor
was
supplied
with
one
hundred
pounds
after
another
to
answer
the
expense
of
secret
service
still
assuring
his
clients
that
everything
was
in
an
excellent
train
and
that
his
adversary
would
gain
nothing
but
shame
and
confusion
of
face
nevertheless
there
was
a
necessity
for
postponing
the
trial
on
account
of
a
material
evidence
who
though
he
wavered
was
not
yet
quite
brought
over
and
the
attorney
found
means
to
put
off
the
decision
from
term
to
term
until
there
was
no
quibble
left
for
further
delay
while
this
suit
was
depending
our
hero
continued
to
move
in
his
usual
sphere
nor
did
the
report
of
his
situation
at
all
operate
to
his
disadvantage
in
the
polite
world
on
the
contrary
it
added
a
fresh
plume
to
his
character
in
the
eyes
of
all
those
who
were
not
before
acquainted
with
the
triumphs
of
his
gallantry
notwithstanding
this
countenance
of
his
friends
he
himself
considered
the
affair
in
a
very
serious
light
and
perceiving
that
at
any
rate
he
must
be
a
considerable
loser
he
resolved
to
double
his
assiduity
in
trade
that
he
might
be
the
more
able
to
afford
the
extraordinary
expense
to
which
he
was
subjected
chapter
fresh
cause
for
exerting
his
equanimity
and
fortitude
the
reader
may
have
observed
that
fathom
with
all
his
circumspection
had
a
weak
side
which
exposed
him
to
sundry
mischances
this
was
his
covetousness
which
on
some
occasions
became
too
hard
for
his
discretion
at
this
period
of
time
it
was
by
the
circumstances
of
his
situation
inflamed
to
a
degree
of
rapacity
he
was
now
prevailed
upon
to
take
a
hand
at
whist
or
piquet
and
even
to
wield
the
though
he
had
hitherto
declared
himself
an
irreconcilable
enemy
to
all
sorts
of
play
and
so
uncommon
was
his
success
and
dexterity
at
these
exercises
as
to
surprise
his
acquaintance
and
arouse
the
suspicion
of
some
people
who
repined
at
his
prosperity
but
in
nothing
was
his
conduct
more
inexcusable
than
in
giving
way
to
the
dangerous
temerity
of
ratchcali
which
he
had
been
always
at
pains
to
restrain
and
permitting
him
to
practise
the
same
fraud
upon
an
english
nobleman
which
had
been
executed
upon
himself
at
frankfort
in
other
words
the
tyrolese
by
the
canal
of
ferdinand
finger
and
recommendation
sold
a
pebble
for
a
real
brilliant
and
in
a
few
days
the
cheat
was
discovered
to
the
infinite
confusion
of
our
adventurer
who
nevertheless
assumed
the
guise
of
innocence
with
so
much
art
and
expressed
such
indignation
against
the
villain
who
had
imposed
upon
his
judgment
and
unsuspecting
generosity
that
his
lordship
acquitted
him
of
any
share
in
the
deceit
and
contented
himself
with
the
restitution
which
he
insisted
upon
making
out
of
his
own
pocket
until
he
should
be
able
to
apprehend
the
rogue
who
had
thought
proper
to
abscond
for
his
own
safety
in
spite
of
all
this
exculpation
his
character
did
not
fail
to
retain
a
sort
of
stigma
which
indeed
the
plainest
proofs
of
innocence
are
hardly
able
to
efface
and
his
connexion
with
such
a
palpable
knave
as
the
tyrolese
appeared
to
be
had
an
effect
to
his
prejudice
in
the
minds
of
all
those
who
were
privy
to
the
occurrence
when
a
man
reputation
is
once
brought
in
question
every
trifle
is
by
the
malevolence
of
mankind
magnified
into
a
strong
presumption
against
the
culprit
a
few
whispers
communicated
by
the
envious
mouth
of
slander
which
he
can
have
no
opportunity
to
answer
and
refute
shall
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
convict
him
of
the
most
horrid
crimes
and
for
one
hypocrite
who
is
decked
with
the
honours
of
virtue
there
are
twenty
good
men
who
suffer
the
ignominy
of
vice
so
well
disposed
are
individuals
to
trample
upon
the
fame
of
their
if
the
most
unblemished
merit
is
not
protected
from
this
injustice
it
will
not
be
wondered
at
that
no
quarter
was
given
to
the
character
of
an
adventurer
like
fathom
who
among
other
unlucky
occurrences
had
the
misfortune
to
be
recognised
about
this
time
by
his
two
parisian
friends
sir
stentor
stile
and
sir
giles
squirrel
these
worthy
had
returned
to
their
own
country
after
having
made
a
very
prosperous
campaign
in
france
at
the
end
of
which
however
they
very
narrowly
escaped
the
galleys
and
seeing
the
polish
count
seated
at
the
head
of
taste
and
politeness
they
immediately
circulated
the
story
of
his
defeat
at
paris
with
many
ludicrous
circumstances
of
their
own
invention
and
did
not
scruple
to
affirm
that
he
was
a
rank
impostor
when
the
laugh
is
raised
upon
a
great
man
he
never
fails
to
dwindle
into
contempt
ferdinand
began
to
perceive
a
change
in
the
countenance
of
his
friends
his
company
was
no
longer
solicited
with
that
eagerness
which
they
had
formerly
expressed
in
his
behalf
even
his
entertainments
were
neglected
when
he
appeared
at
any
private
or
public
assembly
the
ladies
instead
of
glowing
with
pleasure
as
formerly
now
tittered
or
regarded
him
with
looks
of
disdain
and
a
certain
pert
little
forward
coquette
with
a
view
to
put
him
out
of
countenance
by
raising
the
laugh
at
his
expense
asked
him
one
night
at
a
drum
when
he
had
heard
from
his
relations
in
poland
she
succeeded
in
her
design
upon
the
mirth
of
the
audience
but
was
disappointed
in
the
other
part
of
her
aim
for
our
hero
replied
without
the
least
mark
of
discomposure
they
are
all
in
good
health
at
your
service
madam
i
wish
i
knew
in
what
part
of
the
world
your
relations
reside
that
i
might
return
the
compliment
by
this
answer
which
was
the
more
severe
as
the
young
lady
was
of
very
doubtful
extraction
he
retorted
the
laugh
upon
the
aggressor
though
he
likewise
failed
in
his
attempt
upon
her
temper
for
she
was
perhaps
the
only
person
present
who
equalled
himself
in
stability
of
countenance
notwithstanding
this
appearance
of
unconcern
he
was
deeply
touched
with
these
marks
of
alienation
in
the
behaviour
of
his
friends
and
foreseeing
in
his
own
disgrace
the
total
shipwreck
of
his
fortune
he
entered
into
a
melancholy
deliberation
with
himself
about
the
means
of
retrieving
his
importance
in
the
beau
monde
or
of
turning
his
address
into
some
other
channel
where
he
could
stand
upon
a
less
slippery
foundation
in
this
exercise
of
his
thoughts
no
scheme
occurred
more
feasible
than
that
of
securing
the
booty
he
had
made
and
retiring
with
his
associate
who
was
also
blown
into
some
other
country
where
their
names
and
characters
being
unknown
they
might
pursue
their
old
plan
of
commerce
without
molestation
he
imparted
this
suggestion
to
the
tyrolese
who
approved
the
proposal
of
decamping
though
he
combated
with
all
his
might
our
hero
inclination
to
withdraw
himself
before
the
trial
by
repeating
the
assurances
of
the
solicitor
who
told
him
he
might
depend
upon
being
reimbursed
by
the
sentence
of
the
court
for
great
part
of
the
sums
he
had
expended
in
the
course
of
the
prosecution
fathom
suffered
himself
to
be
persuaded
by
these
arguments
supported
with
the
desire
of
making
an
honourable
retreat
and
waiting
patiently
for
the
day
of
trouble
discharged
his
sureties
by
a
personal
appearance
in
court
yet
this
was
not
the
only
score
he
discharged
that
morning
the
solicitor
presented
his
own
bill
before
they
set
out
for
westminster
hall
and
gave
the
count
to
understand
that
it
was
the
custom
from
time
immemorial
for
the
client
to
clear
with
his
attorney
before
trial
ferdinand
had
nothing
to
object
against
this
established
rule
though
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
bad
omen
in
spite
of
all
the
solicitor
confidence
and
protestations
and
he
was
not
a
little
confounded
when
looking
into
the
contents
he
found
himself
charged
with
attendances
he
knew
it
was
not
his
interest
to
disoblige
his
lawyer
at
such
a
juncture
nevertheless
he
could
not
help
expostulating
with
him
on
this
article
which
seemed
to
be
so
falsely
stated
with
regard
to
the
number
when
his
questions
drew
on
an
explanation
by
which
he
found
he
had
incurred
the
penalty
of
three
shillings
and
fourpence
for
every
time
he
chanced
to
meet
the
conscientious
attorney
either
in
the
park
the
or
the
street
provided
they
had
exchanged
the
common
salutation
and
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
the
solicitor
had
often
thrown
himself
in
his
way
with
a
view
to
swell
this
item
of
his
account
with
this
extortion
our
adventurer
was
fain
to
comply
because
he
lay
at
the
mercy
of
the
caitiff
accordingly
he
with
a
good
grace
paid
the
demand
which
including
his
former
disbursements
amounted
to
three
hundred
and
pounds
eleven
shillings
and
threepence
three
farthings
and
then
presenting
himself
before
the
judge
quietly
submitted
to
the
laws
of
the
realm
his
counsel
behaved
like
men
of
consummate
abilities
in
their
profession
they
exerted
themselves
with
equal
industry
eloquence
and
erudition
in
their
endeavours
to
perplex
the
truth
browbeat
the
evidence
puzzle
the
judge
and
mislead
the
jury
but
the
defendant
found
himself
wofully
disappointed
in
the
deposition
of
trapwell
journeyman
whom
the
solicitor
pretended
to
have
converted
to
his
interest
this
witness
as
the
attorney
afterwards
declared
played
booty
and
the
facts
came
out
so
clear
that
ferdinand
count
fathom
was
convicted
of
criminal
conversation
with
the
plaintiff
wife
and
cast
in
fifteen
hundred
pounds
under
the
denomination
of
damages
he
was
not
so
much
surprised
as
afflicted
at
this
decision
because
he
saw
it
gradually
approaching
from
the
examination
of
the
first
evidence
his
thoughts
were
now
employed
in
casting
about
for
some
method
of
deliverance
from
the
snare
in
which
he
found
himself
entangled
to
escape
he
foresaw
it
would
be
impracticable
as
trapwell
would
undoubtedly
be
prepared
for
arresting
him
before
he
could
quit
westminster
hall
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
ratchcali
principles
to
expect
any
assistance
from
that
quarter
in
money
matters
and
he
was
utterly
averse
to
the
payment
of
the
sum
awarded
against
him
which
would
have
exhausted
his
whole
fortune
he
therefore
resolved
to
try
the
friendship
of
some
persons
of
fashion
with
whom
he
had
maintained
an
intimacy
of
correspondence
should
they
fail
him
in
the
day
of
his
necessity
he
proposed
to
have
recourse
to
his
former
sureties
one
of
whom
he
meant
to
bilk
while
the
other
might
accompany
him
in
his
retreat
or
should
both
these
expedients
miscarry
he
determined
rather
than
part
with
his
effects
to
undergo
the
most
disagreeable
confinement
in
hope
of
obtaining
the
jailor
connivance
at
his
escape
these
resolutions
being
taken
he
met
his
fate
with
great
fortitude
and
equanimity
and
calmly
suffered
himself
to
be
conveyed
to
the
house
of
a
sheriff
officer
who
as
he
made
his
exit
from
the
hall
according
to
his
own
expectation
executed
a
writ
against
him
at
the
suit
of
trapwell
for
a
debt
of
two
thousand
pounds
to
this
place
he
was
followed
by
his
solicitor
who
was
allured
by
the
prospect
of
another
job
and
who
with
great
demonstrations
of
satisfaction
congratulated
him
upon
the
happy
issue
of
the
trial
arrogating
to
himself
the
merit
of
having
saved
him
eight
thousand
pounds
in
the
article
of
damages
by
the
previous
steps
he
had
taken
and
the
noble
defence
that
he
and
his
friends
the
counsel
had
made
for
their
client
he
even
hinted
an
expectation
of
receiving
a
gratuity
for
his
extraordinary
care
and
discretion
fathom
galled
as
he
was
with
his
misfortune
and
enraged
at
the
effrontery
of
this
pettifogger
maintained
a
serenity
of
countenance
and
sent
the
attorney
with
a
message
to
the
plaintiff
importing
that
as
he
was
a
foreigner
and
could
not
be
supposed
to
have
so
much
cash
about
him
as
to
spare
fifteen
hundred
pounds
from
the
funds
of
his
ordinary
expense
he
would
grant
him
a
bond
payable
in
two
months
during
which
period
he
should
be
able
to
procure
a
proper
remittance
from
his
own
estate
while
the
solicitor
was
employed
in
this
negotiation
he
despatched
his
to
one
nobleman
and
maurice
to
another
with
billets
signifying
the
nature
of
the
verdict
which
his
adversary
had
obtained
and
desiring
that
each
would
lend
him
a
thousand
pounds
upon
his
parole
until
he
could
negotiate
bills
upon
the
continent
his
three
messengers
returned
almost
at
the
same
instant
of
time
and
these
were
the
answers
they
brought
back
trapwell
absolutely
rejected
his
personal
security
and
threatened
him
with
all
the
horrors
of
a
jail
unless
he
would
immediately
discharge
the
debt
or
procure
sufficient
bondsmen
and
one
of
his
quality
friends
favoured
him
with
this
reply
to
his
request
my
dear
count
i
am
mortally
chagrined
at
the
triumph
you
have
furnished
to
that
rascally
citizen
by
the
lard
the
judge
must
have
been
in
the
terrors
of
cuckoldom
to
influence
the
decision
and
the
jury
a
mere
herd
of
horned
beasts
to
bring
in
such
a
barbarous
verdict
egad
at
this
rate
no
gentleman
will
be
able
to
lie
with
another
wife
but
at
the
risk
of
a
cursed
prosecution
but
to
waive
this
disagreeable
circumstance
which
you
must
strive
to
forget
i
declare
my
mortification
is
still
the
greater
because
i
can
not
at
present
supply
you
with
the
trifle
your
present
exigency
requires
for
to
tell
you
a
secret
my
own
finances
are
in
damnable
confusion
but
a
man
of
count
fathom
figure
and
address
can
never
be
puzzled
for
the
want
of
such
a
paltry
sum
adieu
my
dear
count
we
shall
i
suppose
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
white
meanwhile
i
have
the
honour
to
be
with
the
most
perfect
attachment
yours
grizzlegrin
the
other
noble
peer
to
whom
he
addressed
himself
on
this
occasion
cherished
the
same
sentiments
of
virtue
friendship
and
generosity
but
his
expression
was
so
different
that
we
shall
for
the
edification
of
the
reader
transcribe
his
letter
in
his
own
words
sir
i
was
never
more
astonished
than
at
the
receipt
of
your
very
extraordinary
billet
wherein
you
solicit
the
loan
of
a
thousand
pounds
which
you
desire
may
be
sent
with
the
bearer
on
the
faith
of
your
parole
sir
i
have
no
money
to
send
you
or
lend
you
and
can
not
help
repeating
my
expressions
of
surprise
at
your
confidence
in
making
such
a
strange
and
unwarranted
demand
is
true
i
may
have
made
professions
of
friendship
while
i
looked
upon
you
as
a
person
of
honour
and
good
morals
but
now
that
you
are
convicted
of
such
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
laws
of
that
kingdom
where
you
have
been
treated
with
such
hospitality
and
respect
i
think
myself
fully
absolved
from
any
such
conditional
promise
which
indeed
is
never
interpreted
into
any
other
than
a
bare
compliment
i
am
sorry
you
have
involved
your
character
and
fortune
in
such
a
disagreeable
affair
and
am
sir

trompington
ferdinand
was
not
such
a
novice
in
the
world
as
to
be
disappointed
at
these
repulses
especially
as
he
had
laid
very
little
stress
upon
the
application
which
was
made
by
way
of
an
experiment
upon
the
gratitude
or
caprice
of
those
two
noblemen
whom
he
had
actually
more
than
once
obliged
with
the
same
sort
of
assistance
which
he
now
solicited
though
not
to
such
a
considerable
amount
having
nothing
further
to
expect
from
the
fashionable
world
he
sent
the
tyrolese
to
the
person
who
had
been
bail
for
his
appearance
with
full
instructions
to
explain
his
present
occasion
in
the
most
favourable
light
and
desire
he
would
reinforce
the
credit
of
the
count
with
his
security
but
that
gentleman
though
he
placed
the
most
perfect
confidence
on
the
honour
of
our
hero
and
would
have
willingly
entered
into
bonds
again
for
his
personal
appearance
was
not
quite
so
well
satisfied
of
his
circumstances
as
to
become
liable
for
the
payment
of
two
thousand
pounds
an
expense
which
in
his
opinion
the
finances
of
no
foreign
count
were
able
to
defray
he
therefore
lent
a
deaf
ear
to
the
most
pressing
remonstrances
of
the
ambassador
who
had
recourse
to
several
other
merchants
with
the
same
bad
success
so
that
the
prisoner
despairing
of
bail
endeavoured
to
persuade
ratchcali
that
it
would
be
his
interest
to
contribute
a
thousand
pounds
towards
his
discharge
that
he
might
be
enabled
to
quit
england
with
a
good
grace
and
execute
his
part
of
the
plan
they
had
projected
so
powerful
was
his
eloquence
on
the
occasion
and
such
strength
of
argument
did
he
use
that
even
the
tyrolese
seemed
convinced
though
reluctantly
and
agreed
to
advance
the
necessary
sum
upon
the
bond
and
judgment
of
our
adventurer
who
being
disabled
from
transacting
his
own
affairs
in
person
was
obliged
to
intrust
ratchcali
with
his
keys
papers
and
power
of
attorney
under
the
check
and
inspection
of
his
faithful
maurice
and
the
solicitor
whose
fidelity
he
bespoke
with
the
promise
of
an
ample
recompense
chapter
the
biter
is
bit
yet
he
had
no
sooner
committed
his
effects
to
the
care
of
this
triumvirate
than
his
fancy
was
visited
with
direful
warnings
which
produced
cold
sweats
and
palpitations
and
threw
him
into
such
agonies
of
apprehension
as
he
had
never
known
before
he
remembered
the
former
desertion
of
the
tyrolese
the
recent
villany
of
the
solicitor
and
recollected
the
remarks
he
had
made
upon
the
disposition
and
character
of
his
valet
which
evinced
him
a
fit
companion
for
the
other
two
alarmed
at
these
reflections
he
entreated
the
bailiff
to
indulge
him
with
a
visit
to
his
own
lodgings
and
even
offered
one
hundred
guineas
as
a
gratification
for
his
compliance
but
the
officer
who
had
formerly
lost
a
considerable
sum
by
the
escape
of
a
prisoner
would
not
run
any
risk
in
an
affair
of
such
consequence
and
our
hero
was
obliged
to
submit
to
the
tortures
of
his
own
presaging
fears
after
he
had
waited
five
hours
in
the
most
racking
impatience
he
saw
the
attorney
enter
with
all
the
marks
of
hurry
fatigue
and
consternation
and
heard
him
exclaim
good
god
have
you
seen
the
gentleman
fathom
found
his
fears
realised
in
this
interrogation
to
which
he
answered
in
a
tone
of
horror
and
dismay
what
gentleman
i
suppose
i
am
robbed
speak
and
keep
me
no
longer
in
suspense
robbed
cried
the
attorney
the
lord
forbid
i
hope
you
can
depend
upon
the
person
you
empowered
to
receive
your
jewels
and
cash
i
must
own
his
proceedings
are
a
little
extraordinary
for
after
he
had
rummaged
your
scrutoire
from
which
in
presence
of
me
and
your
servant
he
took
one
hundred
and
fifty
guineas
a
parcel
of
diamond
rings
and
buckles
according
to
this
here
inventory
which
i
wrote
with
my
own
hand
and
east
india
bonds
to
the
tune
of
five
hundred
more
we
adjourned
to
garraway
where
he
left
me
alone
under
pretence
of
going
to
a
broker
of
his
acquaintance
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
while
the
valet
as
i
imagined
waited
for
us
in
the
alley
well
sir
he
stayed
so
long
that
i
began
to
be
uneasy
and
at
length
resolved
to
send
the
servant
in
quest
of
him
but
when
i
went
out
for
that
purpose
deuce
a
servant
was
to
be
found
though
i
in
person
inquired
for
him
at
every
alehouse
within
half
a
mile
of
the
place
i
then
despatched
no
less
than
five
ticket
porters
upon
the
scent
after
them
and
i
myself
by
a
direction
from
the
went
to
signior
ratchcali
lodgings
where
as
they
told
me
he
had
not
been
seen
since
nine
in
the
morning
upon
this
intimation
i
came
directly
hither
to
give
you
timely
notice
that
you
may
without
delay
take
measures
for
your
own
security
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
take
out
writs
for
apprehending
him
in
the
counties
of
middlesex
surrey
kent
and
essex
and
i
shall
put
them
in
the
hands
of
trusty
and
diligent
officers
who
will
soon
ferret
him
out
of
his
provided
he
skulks
within
ten
miles
of
the
bills
of
mortality
to
be
sure
the
job
will
be
expensive
and
all
these
runners
must
be
paid
beforehand
but
what
then
the
defendant
is
worth
powder
and
if
we
can
once
secure
him
i
warrant
the
prosecution
will
quit
cost
fathom
was
almost
choked
with
concern
and
resentment
at
the
news
of
this
mischance
so
that
he
could
not
utter
one
word
until
this
narrative
was
finished
nor
was
his
suspicion
confined
to
the
tyrolese
and
his
own
lacquey
he
considered
the
solicitor
as
their
accomplice
and
director
and
was
so
much
provoked
at
the
latter
part
of
his
harangue
that
his
discretion
seemed
to
vanish
and
collaring
the
attorney
villain
said
he
you
yourself
have
been
a
principal
actor
in
this
robbery
then
turning
to
the
bystanders
and
i
desire
in
the
king
name
that
he
may
be
secured
until
i
can
make
oath
before
a
magistrate
in
support
of
the
charge
if
you
refuse
your
assistance
in
detaining
him
i
will
make
immediate
application
to
one
of
the
secretaries
of
state
who
is
my
particular
friend
and
he
will
see
justice
done
to
all
parties
at
mention
of
this
formidable
name
the
bailiff
and
his
whole
family
were
in
commotion
to
obstruct
the
retreat
of
the
lawyer
who
stood
aghast
and
trembled
under
the
grasp
of
our
adventurer
but
soon
as
he
found
himself
delivered
from
this
embrace
by
the
interposition
of
the
spectators
and
collected
his
spirits
which
had
been
suddenly
dissipated
by
fathom
unexpected
assault
he
began
to
display
one
art
of
his
occupation
which
he
always
reserved
for
extraordinary
occasions
this
was
the
talent
of
abuse
which
he
poured
forth
with
such
fluency
of
opprobrious
language
that
our
hero
smarting
as
he
was
and
almost
desperate
with
his
loss
deviated
from
that
temperance
of
behaviour
which
he
had
hitherto
preserved
and
snatching
up
the
poker
with
one
stroke
opened
a
deep
trench
upon
the
attorney
skull
that
extended
from
the
hind
head
almost
to
the
upper
part
of
the
nose
upon
each
side
of
which
it
discharged
a
sanguine
stream
notwithstanding
the
pain
of
this
application
the
solicitor
was
transported
with
joy
at
the
sense
of
the
smart
and
inwardly
congratulated
himself
upon
the
appearance
of
his
own
blood
which
he
no
sooner
perceived
than
he
exclaimed
i
a
dead
man
and
fell
upon
the
floor
at
full
length
immediate
recourse
was
had
to
a
surgeon
in
the
neighbourhood
who
having
examined
the
wound
declared
there
was
a
dangerous
depression
of
the
first
table
of
the
skull
and
that
if
he
could
save
the
patient
life
without
the
application
of
the
trepan
it
would
be
one
of
the
greatest
cures
that
ever
were
performed
by
this
time
fathom
first
transport
being
overblown
he
summoned
up
his
whole
resolution
and
reflected
upon
his
own
ruin
with
that
fortitude
which
had
never
failed
him
in
the
emergencies
of
his
fate
little
disturbed
at
the
prognostic
of
the
surgeon
which
he
considered
in
the
right
point
of
view
sir
said
he
i
am
not
so
unacquainted
with
the
resistance
of
an
attorney
skull
as
to
believe
the
chastisement
i
have
bestowed
on
him
will
at
all
endanger
his
life
which
is
in
much
greater
jeopardy
from
the
hands
of
the
common
executioner
for
notwithstanding
this
accident
i
am
determined
to
prosecute
the
rascal
for
robbery
with
the
utmost
severity
of
the
law
and
that
i
may
have
a
sufficient
fund
left
for
that
prosecution
i
shall
not
at
present
throw
away
one
farthing
in
unnecessary
expense
but
insist
upon
being
conveyed
to
prison
without
farther
delay
this
declaration
was
equally
unwelcome
to
the
bailiff
surgeon
and
solicitor
who
upon
the
supposition
that
the
count
was
a
person
of
fortune
and
would
rather
part
with
an
immense
sum
than
incur
the
ignominy
of
a
jail
or
involve
himself
in
another
disgraceful
lawsuit
had
resolved
to
fleece
him
to
the
utmost
of
their
power
but
now
the
attorney
finding
him
determined
to
set
his
fate
at
defiance
and
to
retort
upon
him
a
prosecution
which
he
had
no
design
to
undergo
began
to
repent
heartily
of
the
provocation
he
had
given
and
to
think
seriously
on
some
method
to
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
the
incensed
foreigner
with
this
view
while
the
bailiff
conducted
him
to
bed
in
another
apartment
he
desired
the
catchpole
to
act
the
part
of
mediator
between
him
and
the
count
and
furnished
him
with
proper
instructions
for
that
purpose
accordingly
the
landlord
on
his
return
told
fathom
that
he
was
sure
the
solicitor
was
not
a
man
for
this
world
for
that
he
had
left
him
deprived
of
his
senses
and
praying
to
god
with
great
devotion
for
mercy
to
his
murderer
he
then
exhorted
him
with
many
protestations
of
friendship
to
compromise
the
unhappy
affair
by
exchanging
releases
with
the
attorney
before
his
delirium
should
be
known
otherwise
he
would
bring
himself
into
a
most
dangerous
premunire
whether
the
plaintiff
should
die
of
his
wound
or
live
to
prosecute
him
for
assault
and
with
regard
to
your
charge
of
robbery
against
him
said
he
as
it
is
no
more
than
a
base
suspicion
unsupported
by
the
least
shadow
of
evidence
the
bill
would
be
thrown
out
and
then
he
might
sue
you
for
damages
i
therefore
out
of
pure
friendship
and
advise
you
to
compromise
the
affair
and
if
you
think
proper
will
endeavour
to
bring
about
a
mutual
release
our
hero
whose
passion
was
by
this
time
pretty
well
cooled
saw
reason
for
assenting
to
the
proposal
upon
which
the
deed
was
immediately
executed
the
mediator
bill
was
discharged
and
ferdinand
conveyed
in
an
to
prison
after
he
had
empowered
his
own
landlord
to
discharge
his
servants
and
convert
his
effects
into
ready
money
thus
he
saw
himself
in
the
course
of
a
few
hours
deprived
of
his
reputation
rank
liberty
and
friends
and
his
fortune
reduced
from
two
thousand
pounds
to
something
less
than
two
hundred
fifty
of
which
he
had
carried
to
jail

his
pocket
