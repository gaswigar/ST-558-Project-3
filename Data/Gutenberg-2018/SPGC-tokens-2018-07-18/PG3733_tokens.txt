poverty
after
changing
his
piece
georges
duroy
left
the
restaurant
he
twisted
his
mustache
in
military
style
and
cast
a
rapid
sweeping
glance
upon
the
diners
among
whom
were
three
saleswomen
an
untidy
of
uncertain
age
and
two
women
with
their
husbands
when
he
reached
the
sidewalk
he
paused
to
consider
what
route
he
should
take
it
was
the
of
june
and
he
had
only
three
francs
in
his
pocket
to
last
him
the
remainder
of
the
month
that
meant
two
dinners
and
no
lunches
or
two
lunches
and
no
dinners
according
to
choice
as
he
pondered
upon
this
unpleasant
state
of
affairs
he
sauntered
down
rue
notre
dame
de
lorette
preserving
his
military
air
and
carriage
and
rudely
jostled
the
people
upon
the
streets
in
order
to
clear
a
path
for
himself
he
appeared
to
be
hostile
to
the
and
even
to
the
houses
the
entire
city
tall
fair
with
blue
eyes
a
curled
mustache
hair
naturally
wavy
and
parted
in
the
middle
he
recalled
the
hero
of
the
popular
romances
it
was
one
of
those
sultry
parisian
evenings
when
not
a
breath
of
air
is
stirring
the
sewers
exhaled
poisonous
gases
and
the
restaurants
the
disagreeable
odors
of
cooking
and
of
kindred
smells
porters
in
their
astride
their
chairs
smoked
their
pipes
at
the
carriage
gates
and
pedestrians
strolled
leisurely
along
hats
in
hand
when
georges
duroy
reached
the
boulevard
he
halted
again
undecided
as
to
which
road
to
choose
finally
he
turned
toward
the
madeleine
and
followed
the
tide
of
people
the
large
cafes
tempted
duroy
but
were
he
to
drink
only
two
glasses
of
beer
in
an
evening
farewell
to
the
meager
supper
the
following
night
yet
he
said
to
himself
i
will
take
a
glass
at
the
americain
by
jove
i
am
thirsty
he
glanced
at
men
seated
at
the
tables
men
who
could
afford
to
slake
their
thirst
and
he
scowled
at
them
rascals
he
muttered
if
he
could
have
caught
one
of
them
at
a
corner
in
the
dark
he
would
have
choked
him
without
a
scruple
he
recalled
the
two
years
spent
in
africa
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
extorted
money
from
the
arabs
a
smile
hovered
about
his
lips
at
the
recollection
of
an
escapade
which
had
cost
three
men
their
lives
a
foray
which
had
given
his
two
comrades
and
himself
seventy
fowls
two
sheep
money
and
something
to
laugh
about
for
six
months
the
culprits
were
never
found
indeed
they
were
not
sought
for
the
arab
being
looked
upon
as
the
soldier
prey
but
in
paris
it
was
different
there
one
could
not
commit
such
deeds
with
impunity
he
regretted
that
he
had
not
remained
where
he
was
but
he
had
hoped
to
improve
his
condition
and
for
that
reason
he
was
in
paris
he
passed
the
vaudeville
and
stopped
at
the
cafe
americain
debating
as
to
whether
he
should
take
that
glass
before
deciding
he
glanced
at
a
clock
it
was
a
quarter
past
nine
he
knew
that
when
the
beer
was
placed
in
front
of
him
he
would
drink
it
and
then
what
would
he
do
at
eleven
so
he
walked
on
intending
to
go
as
far
as
the
madeleine
and
return
when
he
reached
the
place
de
a
tall
young
man
passed
him
whose
face
he
fancied
was
familiar
he
followed
him
repeating
where
the
deuce
have
i
seen
that
fellow
for
a
time
he
racked
his
brain
in
vain
then
suddenly
he
saw
the
same
man
but
not
so
corpulent
and
more
youthful
attired
in
the
uniform
of
a
hussar
he
exclaimed
wait
forestier
and
hastening
up
to
him
laid
his
hand
upon
the
man
shoulder
the
latter
turned
looked
at
him
and
said
what
do
you
want
sir
duroy
began
to
laugh
do
you
remember
me
no
not
remember
georges
duroy
of
the
sixth
hussars
forestier
extended
both
hands
ah
my
dear
fellow
how
are
you
very
well
and
how
are
you
oh
i
am
not
very
well
i
cough
six
months
out
of
the
twelve
as
a
result
of
bronchitis
contracted
at
bougival
about
the
time
of
my
return
to
paris
four
years
ago
but
you
look
well
forestier
taking
his
former
comrade
arm
told
him
of
his
malady
of
the
consultations
the
opinions
and
the
advice
of
the
doctors
and
of
the
difficulty
of
following
their
advice
in
his
position
they
ordered
him
to
spend
the
winter
in
the
south
but
how
could
he
he
was
married
and
was
a
journalist
in
a
responsible
editorial
position
i
manage
the
political
department
on
vie
francaise
i
report
the
doings
of
the
senate
for
salut
and
from
time
to
time
i
write
for
planete
that
is
what
i
am
doing
duroy
in
surprise
glanced
at
him
he
was
very
much
changed
formerly
forestier
had
been
thin
giddy
noisy
and
always
in
good
spirits
but
three
years
of
life
in
paris
had
made
another
man
of
him
now
he
was
stout
and
serious
and
his
hair
was
gray
on
his
temples
although
he
could
not
number
more
than
years
forestier
asked
where
are
you
going
duroy
replied
nowhere
in
particular
very
well
will
you
accompany
me
to
the
francaise
where
i
have
some
proofs
to
correct
and
afterward
take
a
drink
with
me
yes
gladly
they
walked
along
with
that
familiarity
which
exists
between
schoolmates
and
what
are
you
doing
in
paris
asked
forestier
duroy
shrugged
his
shoulders
dying
of
hunger
simply
when
my
time
was
up
i
came
hither
to
make
my
fortune
or
rather
to
live
in
paris
and
for
six
months
i
have
been
employed
in
a
railroad
office
at
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
forestier
murmured
that
is
not
very
much
but
what
can
i
do
answered
duroy
i
am
alone
i
know
no
one
i
have
no
recommendations
the
spirit
is
not
lacking
but
the
means
are
his
companion
looked
at
him
from
head
to
foot
like
a
practical
man
who
is
examining
a
subject
then
he
said
in
a
tone
of
conviction
you
see
my
dear
fellow
all
depends
on
assurance
here
a
shrewd
observing
man
can
sometimes
become
a
minister
you
must
obtrude
yourself
and
yet
not
ask
anything
but
how
is
it
you
have
not
found
anything
better
than
a
clerkship
at
the
station
duroy
replied
i
hunted
everywhere
and
found
nothing
else
but
i
know
where
i
can
get
three
thousand
francs
at
least
as
at
the
pellerin
school
forestier
stopped
him
do
do
it
for
you
can
earn
ten
thousand
francs
you
will
ruin
your
prospects
at
once
in
your
office
at
least
no
one
knows
you
you
can
leave
it
if
you
wish
to
at
any
time
but
when
you
are
once
a
all
will
be
over
you
might
as
well
be
a
butler
in
a
house
to
which
all
paris
comes
to
dine
when
you
have
given
riding
lessons
to
men
of
the
world
or
to
their
sons
they
will
no
longer
consider
you
their
equal
he
paused
reflected
several
seconds
and
then
asked
are
you
a
bachelor
yes
though
i
have
been
smitten
several
times
that
makes
no
difference
if
cicero
and
tiberius
were
mentioned
would
you
know
who
they
were
yes
good
no
one
knows
any
more
except
about
a
score
of
fools
it
is
not
difficult
to
pass
for
being
learned
the
secret
is
not
to
betray
your
ignorance
just
maneuver
avoid
the
quicksands
and
obstacles
and
the
rest
can
be
found
in
a
dictionary
he
spoke
like
one
who
understood
human
nature
and
he
smiled
as
the
crowd
passed
them
by
suddenly
he
began
to
cough
and
stopped
to
allow
the
paroxysm
to
spend
itself
then
he
said
in
a
discouraged
tone
is
it
tiresome
not
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
this
bronchitis
and
here
is
midsummer
this
winter
i
shall
go
to
mentone
health
before
everything
they
reached
the
boulevarde
poissoniere
behind
a
large
glass
door
an
open
paper
was
affixed
three
people
were
reading
it
above
the
door
was
printed
the
legend
la
vie
francaise
forestier
pushed
open
the
door
and
said
come
in
duroy
entered
they
ascended
the
stairs
passed
through
an
antechamber
in
which
two
clerks
greeted
their
comrade
and
then
entered
a
kind
of
sit
down
said
forestier
i
shall
be
back
in
five
minutes
and
he
disappeared
duroy
remained
where
he
was
from
time
to
time
men
passed
him
by
entering
by
one
door
and
going
out
by
another
before
he
had
time
to
glance
at
them
now
they
were
young
men
very
young
with
a
busy
air
holding
sheets
of
paper
in
their
hands
now
compositors
their
shirts
spotted
with
ink
carefully
carrying
what
were
evidently
fresh
proofs
occasionally
a
gentleman
entered
fashionably
dressed
some
reporter
bringing
news
forestier
reappeared
with
a
tall
thin
man
of
thirty
or
forty
dressed
in
a
black
coat
with
a
white
cravat
a
dark
complexion
and
an
insolent
air
forestier
said
to
him
adieu
my
dear
sir
and
the
other
pressed
his
hand
with
au
revoir
my
friend
then
he
descended
the
stairs
whistling
his
cane
under
his
arm
duroy
asked
his
name
that
is
jacques
rival
the
celebrated
writer
and
duelist
he
came
to
correct
his
proofs
garin
montel
and
he
are
the
best
witty
and
realistic
writers
we
have
in
paris
he
earns
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
for
two
articles
a
week
as
they
went
downstairs
they
met
a
stout
little
man
with
long
hair
who
was
ascending
the
stairs
whistling
forestier
bowed
low
norbert
de
varenne
said
he
the
poet
the
author
of
soleils
morts
a
very
expensive
man
every
poem
he
gives
us
costs
three
hundred
francs
and
the
longest
has
not
two
hundred
lines
but
let
us
go
into
the
napolitain
i
am
getting
thirsty
when
they
were
seated
at
a
table
forestier
ordered
two
glasses
of
beer
he
emptied
his
at
a
single
draught
while
duroy
sipped
his
beer
slowly
as
if
it
were
something
rare
and
precious
suddenly
his
companion
asked
why
do
you
try
journalism
duroy
looked
at
him
in
surprise
and
said
because
i
have
never
written
anything
bah
we
all
have
to
make
a
beginning
i
could
employ
you
myself
by
sending
you
to
obtain
information
at
first
you
would
only
get
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
a
month
but
your
cab
fare
would
be
paid
shall
i
speak
to
the
manager
if
you
will
well
then
come
and
dine
with
me
i
will
only
ask
five
or
six
to
meet
you
the
manager
walter
his
wife
with
jacques
rival
and
norbert
de
varenne
whom
you
have
just
seen
and
also
a
friend
of
mme
forestier
will
you
come
duroy
hesitated
blushing
and
perplexed
finally
he
murmured
i
have
no
suitable
clothes
forestier
was
amazed
you
have
no
dress
suit
egad
that
is
indispensable
in
paris
it
is
better
to
have
no
bed
than
no
clothes
then
fumbling
in
his
he
drew
from
it
two
louis
placed
them
before
his
companion
and
said
kindly
you
can
repay
me
when
it
is
convenient
buy
yourself
what
you
need
and
pay
an
installment
on
it
and
come
and
dine
with
us
at
half
past
seven
at
rue
fontaine
in
confusion
duroy
picked
up
the
money
and
stammered
you
are
very
kind
i
am
much
obliged
be
sure
i
shall
not
forget
forestier
interrupted
him
that
all
right
take
another
glass
of
beer
waiter
two
more
glasses
when
he
had
paid
the
score
the
journalist
asked
would
you
like
a
stroll
for
an
hour
certainly
they
turned
toward
the
madeleine
what
shall
we
do
asked
forestier
they
say
that
in
paris
an
idler
can
always
find
amusement
but
it
is
not
true
a
turn
in
the
bois
is
only
enjoyable
if
you
have
a
lady
with
you
and
that
is
a
rare
occurrence
the
cafe
concerts
may
divert
my
tailor
and
his
wife
but
they
do
not
interest
me
so
what
can
we
do
nothing
there
ought
to
be
a
summer
garden
here
open
at
night
where
a
man
could
listen
to
good
music
while
drinking
beneath
the
trees
it
would
be
a
pleasant
lounging
place
you
could
walk
in
alleys
bright
with
electric
light
and
seat
yourself
where
you
pleased
to
hear
the
music
it
would
be
charming
where
would
you
like
to
go
duroy
did
not
know
what
to
reply
finally
he
said
i
have
never
been
to
the
folies
bergeres
i
should
like
to
go
there
his
companion
exclaimed
the
folies
bergeres
very
well
they
turned
and
walked
toward
the
faubourg
montmartre
the
brilliantly
illuminated
building
loomed
up
before
them
forestier
entered
duroy
stopped
him
we
forgot
to
pass
through
the
gate
the
other
replied
in
a
consequential
tone
i
never
pay
and
approached
the
have
you
a
good
box
certainly
m
forestier
he
took
the
ticket
handed
him
pushed
open
the
door
and
they
were
within
the
hall
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
almost
hid
the
stage
and
the
opposite
side
of
the
theater
in
the
spacious
foyer
which
led
to
the
circular
promenade
brilliantly
dressed
women
mingled
with
men
forestier
forced
his
way
rapidly
through
the
throng
and
accosted
an
usher
box
this
way
sir
the
friends
were
shown
into
a
tiny
box
hung
and
carpeted
in
red
with
four
chairs
upholstered
in
the
same
color
they
seated
themselves
to
their
right
and
left
were
similar
boxes
on
the
stage
three
men
were
performing
on
trapezes
but
duroy
paid
no
heed
to
them
his
eyes
finding
more
to
interest
them
in
the
grand
promenade
forestier
remarked
upon
the
motley
appearance
of
the
throng
but
duroy
did
not
listen
to
him
a
woman
leaning
her
arms
upon
the
edge
of
her
loge
was
staring
at
him
she
was
a
tall
voluptuous
brunette
her
face
whitened
with
enamel
her
black
eyes
penciled
and
her
lips
painted
with
a
movement
of
her
head
she
summoned
a
friend
who
was
passing
a
blonde
with
auburn
hair
likewise
inclined
to
embonpoint
and
said
to
her
in
a
whisper
intended
to
be
heard
there
is
a
nice
fellow
forestier
heard
it
and
said
to
duroy
with
a
smile
you
are
lucky
my
dear
boy
my
congratulations
the
soldier
blushed
and
mechanically
fingered
the
two
pieces
of
gold
in
his
pocket
the
curtain
fell
the
orchestra
played
a
valse
and
duroy
said
shall
we
walk
around
the
gallery
if
you
like
soon
they
were
carried
along
in
the
current
of
promenaders
duroy
drank
in
with
delight
the
air
vitiated
as
it
was
by
tobacco
and
cheap
perfume
but
forestier
perspired
panted
and
coughed
let
us
go
into
the
garden
he
said
turning
to
the
left
they
entered
a
kind
of
covered
garden
in
which
two
large
fountains
were
playing
under
the
yews
men
and
women
sat
at
tables
drinking
another
glass
of
beer
asked
forestier
gladly
they
took
their
seats
and
watched
the
promenaders
occasionally
a
woman
would
stop
and
ask
with
a
coarse
smile
what
have
you
to
offer
sir
forestier
invariable
answer
was
a
glass
of
water
from
the
fountain
and
the
woman
would
mutter
go
along
and
walk
away
at
last
the
brunette
reappeared
with
the
blonde
they
made
a
handsome
couple
the
former
smiled
on
perceiving
duroy
and
taking
a
chair
she
calmly
seated
herself
in
front
of
him
and
said
in
a
clear
voice
waiter
two
glasses
in
astonishment
forestier
exclaimed
you
are
not
at
all
bashful
she
replied
your
friend
has
bewitched
me
he
is
such
a
fine
fellow
i
believe
he
has
turned
my
head
duroy
said
nothing
the
waiter
brought
the
beer
which
the
women
swallowed
rapidly
then
they
rose
and
the
brunette
nodding
her
head
and
tapping
duroy
arm
with
her
fan
said
to
him
thank
you
my
dear
however
you
are
not
very
talkative
as
they
disappeared
forestier
laughed
and
said
tell
me
old
man
did
you
know
that
you
had
a
charm
for
the
weaker
sex
you
must
be
careful
without
replying
duroy
smiled
his
friend
asked
shall
you
remain
any
longer
i
am
going
i
have
had
enough
georges
murmured
yes
i
will
stay
a
little
longer
it
is
not
late
forestier
arose
very
well
then
until
do
not
forget
rue
fontaine
at
seven
thirty
i
shall
not
forget
thank
you
the
friends
shook
hands
and
the
journalist
left
duroy
to
his
own
devices
forestier
once
out
of
sight
duroy
felt
free
and
again
he
joyously
touched
the
gold
pieces
in
his
pocket
then
rising
he
mingled
with
the
crowd
he
soon
discovered
the
blonde
and
the
brunette
he
went
toward
them
but
when
near
them
dared
not
address
them
the
brunette
called
out
to
him
have
you
found
your
tongue
he
stammered
zounds
too
bashful
to
say
another
word
a
pause
ensued
during
which
the
brunette
took
his
arm
and
together
they
left
the
hall
chapter
ii
madame
forestier
where
does
forestier
live
third
floor
on
the
left
said
the
porter
pleasantly
on
learning
duroy
destination
georges
ascended
the
staircase
he
was
somewhat
embarrassed
and
he
had
on
a
new
suit
but
he
was
uncomfortable
he
felt
that
it
was
defective
his
boots
were
not
glossy
he
had
bought
his
shirt
that
same
evening
at
the
louvre
for
four
francs
fifty
his
trousers
were
too
wide
and
betrayed
their
cheapness
in
their
fit
or
rather
misfit
and
his
coat
was
too
tight
slowly
he
ascended
the
stairs
his
heart
beating
his
mind
anxious
suddenly
before
him
stood
a
gentleman
staring
at
him
the
person
resembled
duroy
so
close
that
the
latter
retreated
then
stopped
and
saw
that
it
was
his
own
image
reflected
in
a
not
having
anything
but
a
small
mirror
at
home
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
himself
entirely
and
had
exaggerated
the
imperfections
of
his
toilette
when
he
saw
his
reflection
in
the
glass
he
did
not
even
recognize
himself
he
took
himself
for
some
one
else
for
a
and
was
really
satisfied
with
his
general
appearance
smiling
to
himself
duroy
extended
his
hand
and
expressed
his
astonishment
pleasure
and
approbation
a
door
opened
on
the
staircase
he
was
afraid
of
being
surprised
and
began
to
ascend
more
rapidly
fearing
that
he
might
have
been
seen
posing
there
by
some
of
his
friend
invited
guests
on
reaching
the
second
floor
he
saw
another
mirror
and
once
more
slackened
his
pace
to
look
at
himself
he
likewise
paused
before
the
third
glass
twirled
his
mustache
took
off
his
hat
to
arrange
his
hair
and
murmured
half
aloud
a
habit
of
his
hall
mirrors
are
most
convenient
then
he
rang
the
bell
the
door
opened
almost
immediately
and
before
him
stood
a
servant
in
a
black
coat
with
a
grave
shaven
face
so
perfect
in
his
appearance
that
duroy
again
became
confused
as
he
compared
the
cut
of
their
garments
the
lackey
asked
whom
shall
i
announce
monsieur
he
raised
a
portiere
and
pronounced
the
name
duroy
lost
his
upon
being
ushered
into
a
world
as
yet
strange
to
him
however
he
advanced
a
young
fair
woman
received
him
alone
in
a
large
room
he
paused
disconcerted
who
was
that
smiling
lady
he
remembered
that
forestier
was
married
and
the
thought
that
the
handsome
blonde
was
his
friend
wife
rendered
him
awkward
and
he
stammered
out
madame
i
am
she
held
out
her
hand
i
know
monsieur
charles
told
me
of
your
meeting
last
night
and
i
am
very
glad
that
he
asked
you
to
dine
with
us
duroy
blushed
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
not
knowing
how
to
reply
he
felt
that
he
was
being
inspected
from
his
head
to
his
feet
he
half
thought
of
excusing
himself
of
inventing
an
explanation
of
the
carelessness
of
his
toilette
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
touch
upon
that
delicate
subject
he
seated
himself
upon
a
chair
she
pointed
out
to
him
and
as
he
sank
into
its
luxurious
depths
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
entering
a
new
and
charming
life
that
he
would
make
his
mark
in
the
world
that
he
was
saved
he
glanced
at
mme
forestier
she
wore
a
gown
of
pale
blue
cashmere
which
clung
gracefully
to
her
supple
form
and
rounded
outlines
her
arms
and
throat
rose
in
purity
from
the
mass
of
lace
which
ornamented
the
corsage
and
short
sleeves
her
hair
was
dressed
high
and
curled
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
duroy
grew
more
at
his
ease
under
her
glance
which
recalled
to
him
he
knew
not
why
that
of
the
girl
he
had
met
the
preceding
evening
at
the
mme
forestier
had
gray
eyes
a
small
nose
full
lips
and
a
rather
heavy
chin
an
irregular
attractive
face
full
of
gentleness
and
yet
of
malice
after
a
short
silence
she
asked
have
you
been
in
paris
a
long
time
gradually
regaining
his
he
replied
a
few
months
madame
i
am
in
the
railroad
employ
but
my
friend
forestier
has
encouraged
me
to
hope
that
thanks
to
him
i
can
enter
into
journalism
she
smiled
kindly
and
murmured
in
a
low
voice
i
know
the
bell
rang
again
and
the
servant
announced
mme
de
marelle
she
was
a
dainty
brunette
attired
in
a
simple
dark
robe
a
red
rose
in
her
black
tresses
seemed
to
accentuate
her
special
character
and
a
young
girl
or
rather
a
child
for
such
she
was
followed
her
mme
forestier
said
good
evening
clotilde
good
evening
madeleine
they
embraced
each
other
then
the
child
offered
her
forehead
with
the
assurance
of
an
adult
saying
good
evening
cousin
mme
forestier
kissed
her
and
then
made
the
introductions
georges
duroy
an
old
friend
of
charles
mme
de
marelle
my
friend
a
relative
in
fact
she
added
here
you
know
we
do
not
stand
on
ceremony
duroy
bowed
the
door
opened
again
and
a
short
man
entered
upon
his
arm
a
tall
handsome
woman
taller
than
he
and
much
younger
with
distinguished
manners
and
a
dignified
carriage
it
was
walter
deputy
financier
a
moneyed
man
and
a
man
of
business
manager
of
la
vie
francaise
with
his
wife
nee
basile
ravalade
daughter
of
the
banker
of
that
name
then
came
jacques
rival
very
elegant
followed
by
norbert
de
varenne
the
latter
advanced
with
the
grace
of
the
old
school
and
taking
mme
forestier
hand
kissed
it
his
long
hair
falling
upon
his
bare
arm
as
he
did
so
forestier
now
entered
apologizing
for
being
late
he
had
been
detained
the
servant
announced
dinner
and
they
entered
the
duroy
was
placed
between
mme
de
marelle
and
her
daughter
he
was
again
rendered
uncomfortable
for
fear
of
committing
some
error
in
the
conventional
management
of
his
fork
his
spoon
or
his
glasses
of
which
he
had
four
nothing
was
said
during
the
soup
then
norbert
de
varenne
asked
a
general
question
have
you
read
the
gauthier
case
how
droll
it
was
then
followed
a
discussion
of
the
subject
in
which
the
ladies
joined
then
a
duel
was
mentioned
and
jacques
rival
led
the
conversation
that
was
his
province
duroy
did
not
venture
a
remark
but
occasionally
glanced
at
his
neighbor
a
diamond
upon
a
slight
golden
thread
depended
from
her
ear
from
time
to
time
she
uttered
a
remark
which
evoked
a
smile
upon
his
lips
duroy
sought
vainly
for
some
compliment
to
pay
her
he
busied
himself
with
her
daughter
filled
her
glass
waited
upon
her
and
the
child
more
dignified
than
her
mother
thanked
him
gravely
saying
you
are
very
kind
monsieur
while
she
listened
to
the
conversation
with
a
reflective
air
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
everyone
was
delighted
with
it
the
conversation
returned
to
the
colonization
of
algeria
walter
uttered
several
jocose
remarks
forestier
alluded
to
the
article
he
had
prepared
for
the
morrow
jacques
rival
declared
himself
in
favor
of
a
military
government
with
grants
of
land
to
all
the
officers
after
thirty
years
of
colonial
service
in
that
way
said
he
you
can
establish
a
strong
colony
familiar
with
and
liking
the
country
knowing
its
language
and
able
to
cope
with
all
those
local
yet
grave
questions
which
invariably
confront
newcomers
norbert
de
varenne
interrupted
yes
they
would
know
everything
except
agriculture
they
would
speak
arabic
but
they
would
not
know
how
to
transplant
and
how
to
sow
wheat
they
would
be
strong
in
fencing
but
weak
in
the
art
of
farming
on
the
contrary
the
new
country
should
be
opened
to
everyone
intelligent
men
would
make
positions
for
themselves
the
others
would
succumb
it
is
a
natural
law
a
pause
ensued
everyone
smiled
georges
duroy
startled
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
as
if
he
had
never
heard
it
said
what
is
needed
the
most
down
there
is
good
soil
really
fertile
land
costs
as
much
as
it
does
in
france
and
is
bought
by
wealthy
parisians
the
real
colonists
the
poor
are
generally
cast
out
into
the
desert
where
nothing
grows
for
lack
of
water
all
eyes
turned
upon
him
he
colored
walter
asked
do
you
know
algeria
sir
he
replied
yes
sir
i
was
there
months
leaving
the
subject
of
colonization
norbert
de
varenne
questioned
him
as
to
some
of
the
algerian
customs
georges
spoke
with
animation
excited
by
the
wine
and
the
desire
to
please
he
related
anecdotes
of
the
regiment
of
arabian
life
and
of
the
war
mme
walter
murmured
to
him
in
her
soft
tones
you
could
write
a
series
of
charming
articles
forestier
took
advantage
of
the
situation
to
say
to
walter
my
dear
sir
i
spoke
to
you
a
short
while
since
of
georges
duroy
and
asked
you
to
permit
me
to
include
him
on
the
staff
of
political
reporters
since
marambot
has
left
us
i
have
had
no
one
to
take
urgent
and
confidential
reports
and
the
paper
is
suffering
by
it
walter
put
on
his
spectacles
in
order
to
examine
duroy
then
he
said
i
am
convinced
that
duroy
is
original
and
if
he
will
call
upon
me
tomorrow
at
three
we
will
arrange
matters
after
a
pause
turning
to
the
young
man
he
said
you
may
write
us
a
short
sketch
on
algeria
duroy
simply
relate
your
experiences
i
am
sure
they
will
interest
our
readers
but
you
must
do
it
quickly
mme
walter
added
with
her
customary
serious
grace
you
will
have
a
charming
title
of
a
soldier
in
africa
will
he
not
m
norbert
the
old
poet
who
had
attained
renown
late
in
life
disliked
and
mistrusted
newcomers
he
replied
dryly
yes
excellent
provided
that
it
is
written
in
the
right
key
for
there
lies
the
great
difficulty
mme
forestier
cast
upon
duroy
a
protecting
and
smiling
glance
which
seemed
to
say
you
shall
succeed
the
servant
filled
the
glasses
with
wine
and
forestier
proposed
the
toast
to
the
long
prosperity
of
vie
francaise
duroy
felt
superhuman
strength
within
him
infinite
hope
and
invincible
resolution
he
was
at
his
ease
now
among
these
people
his
eyes
rested
upon
their
faces
with
renewed
assurance
and
for
the
first
time
he
ventured
to
address
his
neighbor
you
have
the
most
beautiful
earrings
i
have
ever
seen
she
turned
toward
him
with
a
smile
it
is
a
fancy
of
mine
to
wear
diamonds
like
this
simply
on
a
thread
he
murmured
in
reply
trembling
at
his
audacity
it
is
charming
but
the
ear
increases
the
beauty
of
the
ornament
she
thanked
him
with
a
glance
as
he
turned
his
head
he
met
mme
forestier
eyes
in
which
he
fancied
he
saw
a
mingled
expression
of
gaiety
malice
and
encouragement
all
the
men
were
talking
at
the
same
time
their
discussion
was
animated
when
the
party
left
the
duroy
offered
his
arm
to
the
little
girl
she
thanked
him
gravely
and
stood
upon
tiptoe
in
order
to
lay
her
hand
upon
his
arm
upon
entering
the
the
young
man
carefully
surveyed
it
it
was
not
a
large
room
but
there
were
no
bright
colors
and
one
felt
at
ease
it
was
restful
the
walls
were
draped
with
violet
hangings
covered
with
tiny
embroidered
flowers
of
yellow
silk
the
portieres
were
of
a
grayish
blue
and
the
chairs
were
of
all
shapes
of
all
sizes
scattered
about
the
room
were
couches
and
large
and
small
all
covered
with
louis
xvi
brocade
or
utrecht
velvet
a
cream
colored
ground
with
garnet
flowers
do
you
take
coffee
m
duroy
mme
forestier
offered
him
a
cup
with
the
smile
that
was
always
upon
her
lips
yes
madame
thank
you
he
took
the
cup
and
as
he
did
so
the
young
woman
whispered
to
him
pay
mme
walter
some
attention
then
she
vanished
before
he
could
reply
first
he
drank
his
coffee
which
he
feared
he
should
let
fall
upon
the
carpet
then
he
sought
a
pretext
for
approaching
the
manager
wife
and
commencing
a
conversation
suddenly
he
perceived
that
she
held
an
empty
cup
in
her
hand
and
as
she
was
not
near
a
table
she
did
not
know
where
to
put
it
he
rushed
toward
her
allow
me
madame
thank
you
sir
he
took
away
the
cup
and
returned
if
you
but
knew
madame
what
pleasant
moments
vie
francaise
afforded
me
when
i
was
in
the
desert
it
is
indeed
the
only
paper
one
cares
to
read
outside
of
france
it
contains
everything
she
smiled
with
amiable
indifference
as
she
replied
walter
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
producing
the
kind
of
journal
which
was
required
they
talked
of
paris
the
suburbs
the
seine
the
delights
of
summer
of
everything
they
could
think
of
finally
norbert
de
varenne
advanced
a
glass
of
liqueur
in
his
hand
and
duroy
discreetly
withdrew
mme
de
marelle
who
was
chatting
with
her
hostess
called
him
so
sir
she
said
bluntly
you
are
going
to
try
journalism
that
question
led
to
a
renewal
of
the
interrupted
conversation
with
mme
walter
in
her
turn
mme
de
marelle
related
anecdotes
and
becoming
familiar
laid
her
hand
upon
duroy
arm
he
felt
that
he
would
like
to
devote
himself
to
her
to
protect
her
and
the
slowness
with
which
he
replied
to
her
questions
indicated
his
preoccupation
suddenly
without
any
cause
mme
de
marelle
called
laurine
and
the
girl
came
to
her
sit
down
here
my
child
you
will
be
cold
near
the
window
duroy
was
seized
with
an
eager
desire
to
embrace
the
child
as
if
part
of
that
embrace
would
revert
to
the
mother
he
asked
in
a
gallant
yet
paternal
tone
will
you
permit
me
to
kiss
you
mademoiselle
the
child
raised
her
eyes
with
an
air
of
surprise
mme
de
marelle
said
with
a
smile
reply
i
will
allow
you
monsieur
but
not
all
the
time
seating
himself
duroy
took
laurine
upon
his
knee
and
kissed
her
lips
and
her
fine
wavy
hair
her
mother
was
surprised
well
that
is
strange
ordinarily
she
only
allows
ladies
to
caress
her
you
are
irresistible
monsieur
duroy
colored
but
did
not
reply
when
mme
forestier
joined
them
a
cry
of
astonishment
escaped
her
well
laurine
has
become
sociable
what
a
miracle
the
young
man
rose
to
take
his
leave
fearing
he
might
spoil
his
conquest
by
some
awkward
word
he
bowed
to
the
ladies
clasped
and
gently
pressed
their
hands
and
then
shook
hands
with
the
men
he
observed
that
jacques
rival
was
dry
and
warm
and
responded
cordially
to
his
pressure
norbert
de
varenne
was
moist
and
cold
and
slipped
through
his
fingers
walter
was
cold
and
soft
without
life
expressionless
forestier
fat
and
warm
his
friend
whispered
to
him
at
three
do
not
forget
never
fear
when
he
reached
the
staircase
he
felt
like
running
down
his
joy
was
so
great
he
went
down
two
steps
at
a
time
but
suddenly
on
the
second
floor
in
the
large
mirror
he
saw
a
gentleman
hurrying
on
and
he
slackened
his
pace
as
much
ashamed
as
if
he
had
been
surprised
in
a
crime
he
surveyed
himself
some
time
with
a
complacent
smile
then
taking
leave
of
his
image
he
bowed
low
ceremoniously
as
if
saluting
some
grand
personage
chapter
iii
first
attempts
when
georges
duroy
reached
the
street
he
hesitated
as
to
what
he
should
do
he
felt
inclined
to
stroll
along
dreaming
of
the
future
and
inhaling
the
soft
night
air
but
the
thought
of
the
series
of
articles
ordered
by
walter
occurred
to
him
and
he
decided
to
return
home
at
once
and
begin
work
he
walked
rapidly
along
until
he
came
to
rue
boursault
the
tenement
in
which
he
lived
was
occupied
by
twenty
families
families
of
workingmen
and
as
he
mounted
the
staircase
he
experienced
a
sensation
of
disgust
and
a
desire
to
live
as
wealthy
men
do
duroy
room
was
on
the
fifth
floor
he
entered
it
opened
his
window
and
looked
out
the
view
was
anything
but
prepossessing
he
turned
away
thinking
this
wo
do
i
must
go
to
work
so
he
placed
his
light
upon
the
table
and
began
to
write
he
dipped
his
pen
into
the
ink
and
wrote
at
the
head
of
his
paper
in
a
bold
hand
souvenirs
of
a
soldier
in
africa
then
he
cast
about
for
the
first
phrase
he
rested
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
stared
at
the
blank
sheet
before
him
what
should
he
say
suddenly
he
thought
i
must
begin
with
my
departure
and
he
wrote
in
about
the
fifteenth
of
may
when
exhausted
france
was
recruiting
after
the
catastrophe
of
the
terrible
years
here
he
stopped
short
not
knowing
how
to
introduce
his
subject
after
a
few
minutes
reflection
he
decided
to
lay
aside
that
page
until
the
following
day
and
to
write
a
description
of
algiers
he
began
algiers
is
a
very
clean
city
but
he
could
not
continue
after
an
effort
he
added
it
is
inhabited
partly
by
arabs
then
he
threw
his
pen
upon
the
table
and
arose
he
glanced
around
his
miserable
room
mentally
he
rebelled
against
his
poverty
and
resolved
to
leave
the
next
day
suddenly
the
desire
to
work
came
on
him
and
he
tried
to
begin
the
article
again
he
had
vague
ideas
of
what
he
wanted
to
say
but
he
could
not
express
his
thoughts
in
words
convinced
of
his
inability
he
arose
once
more
his
blood
coursing
rapidly
through
his
veins
he
turned
to
the
window
just
as
the
train
was
coming
out
of
the
tunnel
and
his
thoughts
reverted
to
his
parents
he
saw
their
tiny
home
on
the
heights
overlooking
rouen
and
the
valley
of
the
seine
his
father
and
mother
kept
an
inn
la
at
which
the
citizens
of
the
faubourgs
took
their
lunches
on
sundays
they
had
wished
to
make
a
gentleman
of
their
son
and
had
sent
him
to
college
his
studies
completed
he
had
entered
the
army
with
the
intention
of
becoming
an
officer
a
colonel
or
a
general
but
becoming
disgusted
with
military
life
he
determined
to
try
his
fortune
in
paris
when
his
time
of
service
had
expired
he
went
thither
with
what
results
we
have
seen
he
awoke
from
his
reflections
as
the
locomotive
whistled
shrilly
closed
his
window
and
began
to
disrobe
muttering
bah
i
shall
be
able
to
work
better
morning
my
brain
is
not
clear
i
have
drunk
a
little
too
much
i
ca
work
well
under
such
circumstances
he
extinguished
his
light
and
fell
asleep
he
awoke
early
and
rising
opened
his
window
to
inhale
the
fresh
air
in
a
few
moments
he
seated
himself
at
his
table
dipped
his
pen
in
the
ink
rested
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
thought
but
in
vain
however
he
was
not
discouraged
but
in
thought
reassured
himself
bah
i
am
not
accustomed
to
it
it
is
a
profession
that
must
be
learned
like
all
professions
some
one
must
help
me
the
first
time
i
go
to
forestier
he
start
my
article
for
me
in
ten
minutes
when
he
reached
the
street
duroy
decided
that
it
was
rather
early
to
present
himself
at
his
friend
house
so
he
strolled
along
under
the
trees
on
one
of
the
boulevards
for
a
time
on
arriving
at
door
he
found
his
friend
going
out
you
here
at
this
hour
can
i
do
anything
for
you
duroy
stammered
in
confusion
i
i
can
not
write
that
article
on
algeria
that
walter
wants
it
is
not
very
surprising
seeing
that
i
have
never
written
anything
it
requires
practice
i
could
write
very
rapidly
i
am
sure
if
i
could
make
a
beginning
i
have
the
ideas
but
i
can
not
express
them
he
paused
and
hesitated
forestier
smiled
maliciously
i
understand
that
duroy
continued
yes
anyone
is
liable
to
have
that
trouble
at
the
beginning
and
well
i
have
come
to
ask
you
to
help
me
in
ten
minutes
you
can
set
me
right
you
can
give
me
a
lesson
in
style
without
you
i
can
do
nothing
the
other
smiled
gaily
he
patted
his
companion
arm
and
said
to
him
go
to
my
wife
she
will
help
you
better
than
i
can
i
have
trained
her
for
that
work
i
have
not
time
this
morning
or
i
would
do
it
willingly
but
duroy
hesitated
at
this
hour
i
can
not
inquire
for
her
oh
yes
you
can
she
has
risen
you
will
find
her
in
my
study
i
will
go
but
i
shall
tell
her
you
sent
me
forestier
walked
away
and
duroy
slowly
ascended
the
stairs
wondering
what
he
should
say
and
what
kind
of
a
reception
he
would
receive
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
said
monsieur
has
gone
out
duroy
replied
ask
mme
forestier
if
she
will
see
me
and
tell
her
that
forestier
whom
i
met
on
the
street
sent
me
the
lackey
soon
returned
and
ushered
duroy
into
madame
presence
she
was
seated
at
a
table
and
extended
her
hand
to
him
so
soon
said
she
it
was
not
a
reproach
but
a
simple
question
he
stammered
i
did
not
want
to
come
up
madame
but
your
husband
whom
i
met
below
insisted
i
dare
scarcely
tell
you
my
errand
i
worked
late
last
night
and
early
this
morning
to
write
the
article
on
algeria
which
walter
wants
and
i
did
not
succeed
i
destroyed
all
my
attempts
i
am
not
accustomed
to
the
work
and
i
came
to
ask
forestier
to
assist
me
his
once
she
interrupted
with
a
laugh
and
he
sent
you
to
me
yes
madame
he
said
you
could
help
me
better
than
he
but
i
dared
not
i
did
not
like
to
she
rose
it
will
be
delightful
to
work
together
that
way
i
am
charmed
with
your
idea
wait
take
my
chair
for
they
know
my
handwriting
on
the
paper
we
will
write
a
successful
article
she
took
a
cigarette
from
the
mantelpiece
and
lighted
it
i
can
not
work
without
smoking
she
said
what
are
you
going
to
say
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
i
do
not
know
i
came
here
to
find
that
out
she
replied
i
will
manage
it
all
right
i
will
make
the
sauce
but
i
must
have
the
dish
she
questioned
him
in
detail
and
finally
said
now
we
will
begin
first
of
all
we
will
suppose
that
you
are
addressing
a
friend
which
will
allow
us
scope
for
remarks
of
all
kinds
begin
this
way
dear
henry
you
wish
to
know
something
about
algeria
you
shall
then
followed
a
brilliantly
worded
description
of
algeria
and
of
the
port
of
algiers
an
excursion
to
the
province
of
oran
a
visit
to
saida
and
an
adventure
with
a
pretty
spanish
maid
employed
in
a
factory
when
the
article
was
concluded
he
could
find
no
words
of
thanks
he
was
happy
to
be
near
her
grateful
for
and
delighted
with
their
growing
intimacy
it
seemed
to
him
that
everything
about
him
was
a
part
of
her
even
to
the
books
upon
the
shelves
the
chairs
the
furniture
the
air
all
were
permeated
with
that
delightful
fragrance
peculiar
to
her
she
asked
bluntly
what
do
you
think
of
my
friend
mme
de
marelle
i
think
her
very
fascinating
he
said
and
he
would
have
liked
to
add
but
not
as
much
so
as
you
he
had
not
the
courage
to
do
so
she
continued
if
you
only
knew
how
comical
original
and
intelligent
she
is
she
is
a
true
bohemian
it
is
for
that
reason
that
her
husband
no
longer
loves
her
he
only
sees
her
defects
and
none
of
her
good
qualities
duroy
was
surprised
to
hear
that
mme
de
marelle
was
married
what
he
asked
is
she
married
what
does
her
husband
do
mme
forestier
shrugged
her
shoulders
oh
he
is
superintendent
of
a
railroad
he
is
in
paris
a
week
out
of
each
month
his
wife
calls
it
week
or
week
of
duty
when
you
get
better
acquainted
with
her
you
will
see
how
witty
she
is
come
here
and
see
her
some
day
as
she
spoke
the
door
opened
noiselessly
and
a
gentleman
entered
unannounced
he
halted
on
seeing
a
man
for
a
moment
mme
forestier
seemed
confused
then
she
said
in
a
natural
voice
though
her
cheeks
were
tinged
with
a
blush
come
in
my
dear
sir
allow
me
to
present
to
you
an
old
comrade
of
charles
georges
duroy
a
future
journalist
then
in
a
different
tone
she
said
our
best
and
dearest
friend
count
de
vaudrec
the
two
men
bowed
gazed
into
one
another
eyes
and
then
duroy
took
his
leave
neither
tried
to
detain
him
on
reaching
the
street
he
felt
sad
and
uncomfortable
count
de
vaudrec
face
was
constantly
before
him
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
man
was
displeased
at
finding
him
with
mme
forestier
though
why
he
should
be
he
could
not
divine
to
while
away
the
time
until
three
he
lunched
at
duval
and
then
lounged
along
the
boulevard
when
the
clock
chimed
the
hour
of
his
appointment
he
climbed
the
stairs
leading
to
the
office
of
la
vie
francaise
duroy
asked
is
walter
in
walter
is
engaged
was
the
reply
will
you
please
take
a
seat
duroy
waited
twenty
minutes
then
he
turned
to
the
clerk
and
said
walter
had
an
appointment
with
me
at
three
at
any
rate
see
if
my
friend
forestier
is
here
he
was
conducted
along
a
corridor
and
ushered
into
a
large
room
in
which
four
men
were
writing
at
a
table
forestier
was
standing
before
the
fireplace
smoking
a
cigarette
after
listening
to
duroy
story
he
said
come
with
me
i
will
take
you
to
walter
or
else
you
might
remain
here
until
seven
they
entered
the
manager

norbert
de
varenne
was
writing
an
article
seated
in
an
easychair
jacques
rival
stretched
upon
a
divan
was
smoking
a
cigar
the
room
had
the
peculiar
odor
familiar
to
all
journalists
when
they
approached
walter
forestier
said
here

my
friend
duroy
the
manager
looked
keenly
at
the
young
man
and
asked

article
duroy
drew
the
sheets
of
manuscript
from
his
pocket
here
they
are

seemed
delighted
and
said
with
a
smile
very
good

word

look
over
it
forestier
but
forestier
hastened

not
necessary

i
helped
him
in
order
to
initiate
him
into
the
profession

to
retain
him
on
the
same

friend
arm
the
journalist
drew
him
away
while
walter
returned
to
the
game
of
ecarte
he
had
been
engaged
in
when
they
entered
forestier
and
duroy
returned
to
the
room
in
which

had
found

heart
chapter
iv
duroy
learns
something
georges
duroy
did
not
sleep
well
so
anxious
was
he
to
see
his
article
in
print
he
rose
at
daybreak
and
was
on
the
street
long
before
the
newsboys
when
he
secured
a
paper
and
saw
his
name
at
the
end
of
a
column
in
large
letters
he
became
very
much
excited
he
felt
inclined
to
enact
the
part
of
a
newsboy
and
cry
out
to
the
hurrying
throng
buy
this
it
contains
an
article
by
me
he
strolled
along
to
a
cafe
and
seated
himself
in
order
to
read
the
article
through
that
done
he
decided
to
go
to
the
railroad
office
draw
his
salary
and
hand
in
his
resignation
with
great
pomposity
he
informed
the
chief
clerk
that
he
was
on
the
staff
of
la
vie
francaise
and
by
that
means
was
avenged
for
many
petty
insults
which
had
been
offered
him
he
then
had
some
cards
written
with
his
new
calling
beneath
his
name
made
several
purchases
and
repaired
to
the
office
of
la
vie
francaise
forestier
received
him
loftily
as
one
would
an
inferior
ah

have
several
things
for
you
to
do
just
wait
ten
minutes
till

finish

work
he
continued
writing
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
sat
a
short
pale
man
very
stout
and
bald
forestier
asked
him
when
his
letter
was
completed

what
time

people

four
take
duroy
who
is
here

added

he
forestier
turned
around
in

and

resumed
his
work
the
two
men
walked
down
the
boulevard
together
while
gave
duroy
a
sketch
of
all
the
officials
connected
with
the
paper
sparing
no
one
in
his
criticism
when
he
mentioned
forestier
he
said
as
for
him
he
was
fortunate
in
marrying
his
wife
duroy
asked
what
about
his
wife
rubbed
his
hands
oh
she
is
beloved
by
an
old
fellow
named
vaudrec
he
dotes
upon
her
duroy
felt
as
if
he
would
like
to
box
ears
to
change
the
subject
he
said
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
late
and
we
have
two
noble
lords
to
call
upon
laughed
you
are
very
innocent
do
you
think
that
i
am
going
to
interview
that
chinese
and
that
indian
as
if
i
did
not
know
better
than
they
do
what
they
should
think
to
please
the
readers
of
vie
francaise
i
have
interviewed
five
hundred
chinese
prussians
hindoos
chilians
and
japanese
they
all
say
the
same
thing
i
need
only
copy
my
article
on
the
last
comer
word
for
word
changing
the
heading
names
titles
and
ages
in
that
there
must
be
no
error
or
i
shall
be
hauled
over
the
coals
by
the
or
but
on
that
subject
the
porter
of
the
hotels
will
post
me
in
five
minutes
we
will
smoke
our
cigars
and
stroll
in
that
direction
total
one
hundred
sous
for
cabfare
that
is
the
way
my
dear
fellow
when
they
arrived
at
the
madeleine
said
to
his
companion
if
you
have
anything
to
do
i
do
not
need
you
duroy
shook
hands
with
him
and
walked
away
the
thought
of
the
article
he
had
to
write
that
evening
haunted
him
mentally
he
collected
the
material
as
he
wended
his
way
to
the
cafe
at
which
he
dined
then
he
returned
home
and
seated
himself
at
his
table
to
work
before
his
eyes
was
the
sheet
of
blank
paper
but
all
the
material
he
had
amassed
had
escaped
him
after
trying
for
an
hour
and
after
filling
five
pages
with
sentences
which
had
no
connection
one
with
the
other
he
said
i
am
not
yet
familiar
with
the
work
i
must
take
another
lesson
at
ten
the
following
morning
he
rang
the
bell
at
his
house
the
servant
who
opened
the
door
said
monsieur
is
busy
duroy
had
not
expected
to
find
forestier
at
home
however
he
said
tell
him
it
is
duroy
on
important
business
in
the
course
of
five
minutes
he
was
ushered
into
the
room
in
which
he
had
spent
so
happy
a
morning
in
the
place
mme
forestier
had
occupied
her
husband
was
seated
writing
while
mme
forestier
stood
by
the
mantelpiece
and
dictated
to
him
a
cigarette
between
her
lips
duroy
paused
upon
the
threshold
and
murmured
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
interrupting
you
his
friend
growled
angrily
what
do
you
want
again
make
haste
we
are
busy
georges
stammered
it
is
nothing
but
forestier
persisted
come
we
are
losing
time
you
did
not
force
your
way
into
the
house
for
the
pleasure
of
bidding
us
good
morning
duroy
in
confusion
replied
no
it
is
this
i
can
not
complete
my
article
and
you
were
so
so
kind
the
last
time
that
i
hoped
that
i
dared
to
come
forestier
interrupted
with
so
you
think
i
will
do
your
work
and
that
you
have
only
to
take
the
money
well
that
is
fine
his
wife
smoked
on
without
interfering
duroy
hesitated
excuse
me
i
believed
i
thought
then
in
a
clear
voice
he
said
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
madame
and
thank
you
very
much
for
the
charming
article
you
wrote
for
me
yesterday
then
he
bowed
and
said
to
charles
i
will
be
at
the
office
at
three
he
returned
home
saying
to
himself
very
well
i
will
write
it
alone
and
they
shall
see
scarcely
had
he
entered
than
he
began
to
write
anger
spurring
him
on
in
an
hour
he
had
finished
an
article
which
was
a
chaos
of
absurd
matter
and
took
it
boldly
to
the
office
duroy
handed
forestier
his
manuscript
here
is
the
rest
of
algeria
very
well
i
will
hand
it
to
the
manager
that
will
do
when
duroy
and
who
had
some
political
information
to
look
up
were
in
the
hall
the
latter
asked
have
you
been
to
the
room
no
why
why
to
get
your
pay
you
should
always
get
your
salary
a
month
in
advance
one
can
not
tell
what
might
happen
i
will
introduce
you
to
the
cashier
duroy
drew
his
two
hundred
francs
together
with
francs
for
his
article
of
the
preceding
day
which
in
addition
to
what
remained
to
him
of
his
salary
from
the
railroad
office
left
him
three
hundred
and
forty
francs
he
had
never
had
so
much
and
he
thought
himself
rich
for
an
indefinite
time
took
him
to
the
offices
of
four
or
five
rival
papers
hoping
that
the
news
he
had
been
commissioned
to
obtain
had
been
already
received
by
them
and
that
he
could
obtain
it
by
means
of
his
diplomacy
when
evening
came
duroy
who
had
nothing
more
to
do
turned
toward
the
and
walking
up
to
the
office
he
said
my
name
is
georges
duroy
i
am
on
the
staff
of
vie
francaise
i
was
here
the
other
night
with
forestier
who
promised
to
get
me
a
pass
i
do
not
know
if
he
remembered
it
the
register
was
consulted
but
his
name
was
not
inscribed
upon
it
however
the
cashier
a
very
affable
man
said
to
him
come
in
duroy
and
speak
to
the
manager
yourself
he
will
see
that
everything
is
all
right
he
entered
and
almost
at
once
came
upon
rachel
the
woman
he
had
seen
there
before
she
approached
him
good
evening
my
dear
are
you
well
very
well
how
are
you
i
am
not
ill
i
have
dreamed
of
you
twice
since
the
other
night
duroy
smiled
what
does
that
mean
that
means
that
i
like
you
she
raised
her
eyes
to
the
young
face
took
his
arm
and
leaning
upon
it
said
let
us
drink
a
glass
of
wine
and
then
take
a
walk
i
should
like
to
go
to
the
opera
like
this
with
you
to
show
you
off
at
daybreak
he
again
sallied
forth
to
obtain
a
vie
francaise
he
opened
the
paper
feverishly
his
article
was
not
there
on
entering
the
office
several
hours
later
he
said
to
walter
i
was
very
much
surprised
this
morning
not
to
see
my
second
article
on
algeria
the
manager
raised
his
head
and
said
sharply
i
gave
it
to
your
friend
forestier
and
asked
him
to
read
it
he
was
dissatisfied
with
it
it
will
have
to
be
done
over
without
a
word
duroy
left
the
room
and
entering
his
friend
office
brusquely
asked
why
did
not
my
article
appear
this
morning
the
journalist
who
was
smoking
a
cigar
said
calmly
the
manager
did
not
consider
it
good
and
bade
me
return
it
to
you
to
be
revised
there
it
is
duroy
revised
it
several
times
only
to
have
it
rejected
he
said
nothing
more
of
his
souvenirs
but
gave
his
whole
attention
to
reporting
he
became
acquainted
behind
the
scenes
at
the
theaters
and
in
the
halls
and
corridors
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
he
knew
all
the
cabinet
ministers
generals
police
agents
princes
ambassadors
men
of
the
world
greeks
cabmen
waiters
at
cafes
and
many
others
in
short
he
soon
became
a
remarkable
reporter
of
great
value
to
the
paper
so
walter
said
but
as
he
only
received
ten
centimes
a
line
in
addition
to
his
fixed
salary
of
two
hundred
francs
and
as
his
expenses
were
large
he
never
had
a
sou
when
he
saw
certain
of
his
associates
with
their
pockets
full
of
money
he
wondered
what
secret
means
they
employed
in
order
to
obtain
it
he
determined
to
penetrate
that
mystery
to
enter
into
the
association
to
obtrude
himself
upon
his
comrades
and
make
them
share
with
him
often
at
evening
as
he
watched
the
trains
pass
his
window
he
dreamed
of
the
conduct
he
might
pursue
chapter
the
first
intrigue
two
months
elapsed
it
was
september
the
fortune
which
duroy
had
hoped
to
make
so
rapidly
seemed
to
him
slow
in
coming
above
all
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
mediocrity
of
his
position
he
was
appreciated
but
was
treated
according
to
his
rank
forestier
himself
no
longer
invited
him
to
dinner
and
treated
him
as
an
inferior
often
he
had
thought
of
making
mme
forestier
a
visit
but
the
remembrance
of
their
last
meeting
restrained
him
mme
de
marelle
had
invited
him
to
call
saying
i
am
always
at
home
about
three
so
one
afternoon
when
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
proceeded
toward
her
house
she
lived
on
rue
verneuil
on
the
fourth
floor
a
maid
answered
his
summons
and
said
yes
madame
is
at
home
but
i
do
not
know
whether
she
has
risen
she
conducted
duroy
into
the
which
was
large
poorly
furnished
and
somewhat
untidy
the
shabby
threadbare
chairs
were
ranged
along
the
walls
according
to
the
servant
fancy
for
there
was
not
a
trace
visible
of
the
care
of
a
woman
who
loves
her
home
duroy
took
a
seat
and
waited
some
time
then
a
door
opened
and
mme
de
marelle
entered
hastily
clad
in
a
japanese
she
exclaimed
how
kind
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
i
was
positive
you
had
forgotten
me
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
gesture
of
delight
and
duroy
quite
at
his
ease
in
that
shabby
apartment
kissed
it
as
he
had
seen
norbert
de
varenne
do
examining
him
from
head
to
foot
she
cried
how
you
have
changed
well
tell
me
the
news
they
began
to
chat
at
once
as
if
they
were
old
acquaintances
and
in
five
minutes
an
intimacy
a
mutual
understanding
was
established
between
those
two
beings
alike
in
character
and
kind
suddenly
the
young
woman
said
in
surprise
it
is
astonishing
how
i
feel
with
you
it
seems
to
me
as
if
i
had
known
you
ten
years
we
shall
undoubtedly
become
good
friends
would
that
please
you
he
replied
certainly
with
a
smile
more
expressive
than
words
he
thought
her
very
bewitching
in
her
pretty
gown
when
near
mme
forestier
whose
impassive
gracious
smile
attracted
yet
held
at
a
distance
and
seemed
to
say
i
like
you
yet
take
care
he
felt
a
desire
to
cast
himself
at
her
feet
or
to
kiss
the
hem
of
her
garment
when
near
mme
de
marelle
he
felt
a
more
passionate
desire
a
gentle
rap
came
at
the
door
through
which
mme
de
marelle
had
entered
and
she
cried
you
may
come
in
my
darling
the
child
entered
advanced
to
duroy
and
offered
him
her
hand
the
astonished
mother
murmured
that
is
a
conquest
the
young
man
having
kissed
the
child
seated
her
by
his
side
and
with
a
serious
air
questioned
her
as
to
what
she
had
done
since
they
last
met
she
replied
in
a
voice
and
with
the
manner
of
a
woman
the
clock
struck
three
the
journalist
rose
come
often
said
mme
de
marelle
it
has
been
a
pleasant
causerie
i
shall
always
be
glad
to
welcome
you
why
do
i
never
meet
you
at
the
forestiers
for
no
particular
reason
i
am
very
busy
i
hope
however
that
we
shall
meet
there
one
of
these
days
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
he
paid
another
visit
to
the
enchantress
the
maid
ushered
him
into
the
and
laurine
soon
entered
she
offered
him
not
her
hand
but
her
forehead
and
said
mamma
wishes
me
to
ask
you
to
wait
for
her
about
fifteen
minutes
for
she
is
not
dressed
i
will
keep
you
company
duroy
who
was
amused
at
the
child
ceremonious
manner
replied
indeed
mademoiselle
i
shall
be
enchanted
to
spend
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
you
when
the
mother
entered
they
were
in
the
midst
of
an
exciting
game
and
mme
de
marelle
paused
in
amazement
crying
laurine
playing
you
are
a
sorcerer
sir
he
placed
the
child
whom
he
had
caught
in
his
arms
upon
the
floor
kissed
the
lady
hand
and
they
seated
themselves
the
child
between
them
they
tried
to
converse
but
laurine
usually
so
silent
monopolized
the
conversation
and
her
mother
was
compelled
to
send
her
to
her
room
when
they
were
alone
mme
de
marelle
lowered
her
voice
and
said
i
have
a
great
project
it
is
this
as
i
dine
every
week
at
the
foresters
i
return
it
from
time
to
time
by
inviting
them
to
a
restaurant
i
do
not
like
to
have
company
at
home
i
am
not
so
situated
that
i
can
have
any
i
know
nothing
about
housekeeping
or
cooking
i
prefer
a
life
free
from
care
therefore
i
invite
them
to
the
cafe
occasionally
but
it
is
not
lively
when
we
are
only
three
i
am
telling
you
this
in
order
to
explain
such
an
informal
gathering
i
should
like
you
to
be
present
at
our
saturdays
at
the
cafe
riche
at
do
you
know
the
house
duroy
accepted
gladly
he
left
her
in
a
transport
of
delight
and
impatiently
awaited
the
day
of
the
dinner
he
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
place
appointed
and
was
shown
into
a
small
private
room
in
which
the
table
was
laid
for
four
that
table
looked
very
inviting
with
its
colored
glasses
silver
and
candelabra
duroy
seated
himself
upon
a
low
bench
forestier
entered
and
shook
hands
with
him
with
a
cordiality
he
never
evinced
at
the
office
the
two
ladies
will
come
together
said
he
these
dinners
are
truly
delightful
very
soon
the
door
opened
and
mesdames
forestier
and
de
marelle
appeared
heavily
veiled
surrounded
by
the
charming
mystery
necessary
to
a
rendezvous
in
a
place
so
public
as
duroy
greeted
the
former
she
took
him
to
task
for
not
having
been
to
see
her
then
she
added
with
a
smile
ah
you
prefer
mme
de
marelle
the
time
passes
more
pleasantly
with
her
when
the
waiter
handed
the
to
forestier
mme
de
marelle
exclaimed
bring
the
whatever
they
want
as
for
us
we
want
nothing
but
champagne
forestier
who
seemed
not
to
have
heard
her
asked
do
you
object
to
my
closing
the
window
my
cough
has
troubled
me
for
several
days
not
at
all
his
wife
did
not
speak
the
various
courses
were
duly
served
and
then
the
guests
began
to
chat
they
discussed
a
scandal
which
was
being
circulated
about
a
society
belle
forestier
was
very
much
amused
by
it
duroy
said
with
a
smile
how
many
would
abandon
themselves
to
a
caprice
a
dream
of
love
if
they
did
not
fear
that
they
would
pay
for
a
brief
happiness
with
tears
and
an
irremediable
scandal
both
women
glanced
at
him
approvingly
forestier
cried
with
a
sceptical
laugh
the
poor
husbands
then
they
talked
of
love
duroy
said
when
i
love
a
woman
everything
else
in
the
world
is
forgotten
mme
forestier
murmured
there
is
no
happiness
comparable
to
that
first
clasp
of
the
hand
when
one
asks
you
love
me
and
the
other
replies
i
love
you
mme
de
marelle
cried
gaily
as
she
drank
a
glass
of
champagne
i
am
less
platonic
forestier
lying
upon
the
couch
said
in
serious
tone
that
frankness
does
you
honor
and
proves
you
to
be
a
practical
woman
but
might
one
ask
what
is
de
marelle
opinion
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
disdainfully
and
said
de
marelle
has
no
opinion
on
that
subject
the
conversation
grew
slow
mme
de
marelle
seemed
to
offer
provocation
by
her
remarks
while
mme
forestier
charming
reserve
the
modesty
in
her
voice
in
her
smile
all
seemed
to
extenuate
the
bold
sallies
which
issued
from
her
lips
the
dessert
came
and
then
followed
the
coffee
the
hostess
and
her
guests
lighted
cigarettes
but
forestier
suddenly
began
to
cough
when
the
attack
was
over
he
growled
angrily
these
parties
are
not
good
for
me
they
are
stupid
let
us
go
home
mme
de
marelle
summoned
the
waiter
and
asked
for
her
bill
she
tried
to
read
it
but
the
figures
danced
before
her
eyes
she
handed
the
paper
to
duroy
here
pay
it
for
me
i
can
not
see
at
the
same
time
she
put
her
purse
in
his
hand
the
total
was
one
hundred
and
thirty
francs
duroy
glanced
at
the
bill
and
when
it
was
settled
whispered
how
much
shall
i
give
the
waiter
whatever
you
like
i
do
not
know
he
laid
five
francs
upon
the
plate
and
handed
the
purse
to
its
owner
saying
shall
i
escort
you
home
certainly
i
am
unable
to
find
the
house
they
shook
hands
with
the
forestiers
and
were
soon
rolling
along
in
a
cab
side
by
side
duroy
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
he
felt
impelled
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
if
i
should
dare
what
would
she
do
thought
he
the
recollection
of
their
conversation
at
dinner
emboldened
but
the
fear
of
scandal
restrained
him
mme
de
marelle
reclined
silently
in
her
corner
he
would
have
thought
her
asleep
had
he
not
seen
her
eyes
glisten
whenever
a
ray
of
light
penetrated
the
dark
recesses
of
the
carriage
of
what
was
she
thinking
suddenly
she
moved
her
foot
nervously
impatiently
that
movement
caused
him
to
tremble
and
turning
quickly
he
cast
himself
upon
her
seeking
her
lips
with
his
she
uttered
a
cry
attempted
to
repulse
him
and
then
yielded
to
his
caresses
as
if
she
had
not
the
strength
to
resist
the
carriage
stopped
at
her
door
but
she
did
not
rise
she
did
not
move
stunned
by
what
had
just
taken
place
fearing
that
the
cabman
would
mistrust
something
duroy
alighted
from
the
cab
first
and
offered
his
hand
to
the
young
woman
finally
she
got
out
but
in
silence
georges
rang
the
bell
and
when
the
door
was
opened
he
asked
timidly
when
shall
i
see
you
again
she
whispered
so
low
that
he
could
barely
hear
her
come
and
lunch
with
me
with
those
words
she
disappeared
duroy
gave
the
cabman
a
piece
and
turned
away
with
a
triumphant
joyful
air
he
had
at
last
conquered
a
married
woman
a
woman
of
the
world
a
parisian
how
easy
it
had
been
he
was
somewhat
nervous
the
following
day
as
he
ascended
mme
de
marelle
staircase
how
would
she
receive
him
suppose
she
forbade
him
to
enter
her
house
if
she
had
told
but
no
she
could
not
tell
anything
without
telling
the
whole
truth
he
was
master
of
the
situation
the
little
opened
the
door
she
was
as
pleasant
as
usual
duroy
felt
reassured
and
asked
is
madame
well
yes
sir
as
well
as
she
always
is
was
the
reply
and
he
was
ushered
into
the
salon
he
walked
to
the
mantelpiece
to
see
what
kind
of
an
appearance
he
presented
he
was
readjusting
his
cravat
when
he
saw
in
the
mirror
the
young
woman
standing
on
the
threshold
looking
at
him
he
pretended
not
to
have
seen
her
and
for
several
moments
they
gazed
at
one
another
in
the
mirror
then
he
turned
she
had
not
moved
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
he
rushed
toward
her
crying
how
i
love
you
he
clasped
her
to
his
breast
he
thought
it
is
easier
than
i
thought
it
would
be
all
is
well
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
without
uttering
a
word
trying
to
put
into
his
glance
a
wealth
of
love
she
too
smiled
and
murmured
we
are
alone
i
sent
laurine
to
lunch
with
a
friend
he
sighed
and
kissing
her
wrists
said
thanks
i
adore
you
she
took
his
arm
as
if
he
had
been
her
husband
and
led
him
to
a
couch
upon
which
they
seated
themselves
side
by
side
duroy
stammered
incoherently
you
do
not
care
for
me
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
lips
be
silent
how
i
love
you
said
he
she
repeated
be
silent
they
could
hear
the
servant
laying
the
table
in
the
he
rose
i
can
not
sit
so
near
you
i
shall
lose
my
head
the
door
opened
madame
is
served
he
offered
her
his
arm
gravely
they
lunched
without
knowing
what
they
were
eating
the
servant
came
and
went
without
seeming
to
notice
anything
when
the
meal
was
finished
they
returned
to
the
and
resumed
their
seats
on
the
couch
side
by
side
gradually
he
drew
nearer
her
and
tried
to
embrace
her
be
careful
some
one
might
come
in
he
whispered
when
can
i
see
you
alone
to
tell
you
how
i
love
you
she
leaned
toward
him
and
said
softly
i
will
pay
you
a
visit
one
of
these
days
he
colored
my
rooms
are
are
very
modest
she
smiled
that
makes
no
difference
i
shall
come
to
see
you
and
not
your
rooms
he
urged
her
to
tell
him
when
she
would
come
she
fixed
a
day
in
the
following
week
while
he
besought
her
with
glowing
eyes
to
hasten
the
day
she
was
amused
to
see
him
implore
so
ardently
and
yielded
a
day
at
a
time
he
repeated
say
finally
she
consented
yes
at
five
he
drew
a
deep
breath
then
they
chatted
together
as
calmly
as
if
they
had
known
one
another
for
twenty
years
a
ring
caused
them
to
start
they
separated
she
murmured
it
is
laurine
the
child
entered
paused
in
surprise
then
ran
toward
duroy
clapping
her
hands
delighted
to
see
him
and
crying
ah
mme
de
marelle
laughed
laurine
has
christened
you
it
is
a
pretty
name
i
shall
call
you
too
he
took
the
child
upon
his
knee
at
twenty
minutes
of
three
he
rose
to
go
to
the
office
at
the
door
he
whispered
five
the
young
woman
replied
yes
with
a
smile
and
disappeared
after
he
had
finished
his
journalistic
work
he
tried
to
render
his
apartments
more
fit
to
receive
his
expected
visitor
he
was
well
satisfied
with
the
results
of
his
efforts
and
retired
lulled
to
rest
by
the
whistling
of
the
trains
early
the
next
morning
he
bought
a
cake
and
a
bottle
of
madeira
he
spread
the
collation
on
his
which
was
covered
with
a
napkin
then
he
waited
she
came
at
a
quarter
past
five
and
exclaimed
as
she
entered
why
it
is
nice
here
but
there
were
a
great
many
people
on
the
stairs
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
hair
an
hour
and
a
half
later
he
escorted
her
to
a
on
the
rue
de
rome
when
she
was
seated
in
the
cab
he
whispered
tuesday
at
the
same
hour
she
repeated
his
words
and
as
it
was
night
she
kissed
him
then
as
the
cabman
started
up
his
horse
she
cried
adieu
and
the
old
coupe
rumbled
off
for
three
weeks
duroy
received
mme
de
marelle
every
two
or
three
days
sometimes
in
the
morning
sometimes
in
the
evening
as
he
was
awaiting
her
one
afternoon
a
noise
on
the
staircase
drew
him
to
his
door
a
child
screamed
a
man
angry
voice
cried
what
is
the
brat
howling
about
a
woman
voice
replied
nicolas
has
been
tripped
up
on
the
by
the
journalist
sweetheart
duroy
retreated
for
he
heard
the
rustling
of
skirts
soon
there
was
a
knock
at
his
door
which
he
opened
and
mme
de
marelle
rushed
in
crying
did
you
hear
georges
feigned
ignorance
of
the
matter
no
what
how
they
insulted
me
who
those
miserable
people
below
why
no
what
is
it
tell
me
she
sobbed
and
could
not
speak
he
was
forced
to
place
her
upon
his
bed
and
to
lay
a
damp
cloth
upon
her
temples
when
she
grew
calmer
anger
succeeded
her
agitation
she
wanted
duroy
to
go
downstairs
at
once
to
fight
them
to
kill
them
he
replied
they
are
just
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
to
court
where
you
would
be
recognized
one
must
not
compromise
oneself
with
such
people
she
said
what
shall
we
do
i
can
not
come
here
again
he
replied
that
is
very
simple
i
will
move
she
murmured
yes
but
that
will
take
some
time
suddenly
she
said
listen
to
me
i
have
found
a
means
do
not
worry
about
it
i
will
send
you
a
blue
morning
she
called
a
telegram
a
little
blue
she
smiled
with
delight
at
her
plans
which
she
would
not
reveal
she
was
however
very
much
affected
as
she
descended
the
staircase
and
leaned
with
all
her
strength
upon
her
lover
arm
they
met
no
one
he
was
still
in
bed
the
following
morning
when
the
promised
telegram
was
handed
him
duroy
opened
it
and
read
come
at
five
to
rue
de
constantinople
no
ask
for
the
room
rented
by
mme
duroy
clo
at
five
precisely
he
entered
a
large
furnished
house
and
asked
the
janitor
has
mme
duroy
hired
a
room
here
yes
sir
will
you
show
me
to
it
if
you
please
the
man
accustomed
no
doubt
to
situations
in
which
it
was
necessary
to
be
prudent
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
then
selecting
a
key
he
asked
are
you
m
duroy
certainly
he
opened
a
small
suite
comprising
two
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
duroy
thought
uneasily
this
will
cost
a
fortune
i
shall
have
to
run
into
debt
she
has
done
a
very
foolish
thing
the
door
opened
and
clotilde
rushed
in
she
was
enchanted
is
it
not
fine
there
are
no
stairs
to
climb
it
is
on
the
ground
floor
one
could
come
and
go
through
the
window
without
the
porter
seeing
one
he
embraced
her
nervously
not
daring
to
ask
the
question
that
hovered
upon
his
lips
she
had
placed
a
large
package
on
the
stand
in
the
center
of
the
room
opening
it
she
took
out
a
tablet
of
soap
a
bottle
of
lubin
extract
a
sponge
a
box
of
hairpins
a
and
then
she
amused
herself
by
finding
places
in
which
to
put
them
she
talked
incessantly
as
she
opened
the
drawers
i
must
bring
some
linen
in
order
to
have
a
change
we
shall
each
have
a
key
besides
the
one
at
the
lodge
in
case
we
should
forget
ours
i
rented
the
apartments
for
three
months
in
your
name
of
course
for
i
could
not
give
mine
then
he
asked
will
you
tell
me
when
to
pay
she
replied
simply
it
is
paid
my
dear
he
made
a
pretense
of
being
angry
i
can
not
permit
that
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
said
in
a
supplicatory
tone
georges
it
will
give
me
pleasure
to
have
the
nest
mine
say
that
you
do
not
care
dear
georges
and
he
yielded
when
she
had
left
him
he
murmured
she
is
anyway
several
days
later
he
received
a
telegram
which
read
my
husband
is
coming
home
this
evening
we
shall
therefore
not
meet
for
a
week
what
a
bore
my
dearest
your
clo
duroy
was
startled
he
had
not
realized
the
fact
that
mme
de
marelle
was
married
he
impatiently
awaited
her
husband
departure
one
morning
he
received
the
following
telegram
five
clo
when
they
met
she
rushed
into
his
arms
kissed
him
passionately
and
asked
after
a
while
will
you
take
me
to
dine
certainly
my
darling
wherever
you
wish
to
go
i
should
like
to
go
to
some
restaurant
frequented
by
the
they
repaired
to
a
wine
merchant
where
meals
were
also
served
clotilde
entrance
caused
a
sensation
on
account
of
the
elegance
of
her
dress
they
partook
of
a
ragout
of
mutton
and
left
that
place
to
enter
a
in
which
she
pressed
more
closely
to
his
side
in
fifteen
minutes
her
curiosity
was
satisfied
and
he
conducted
her
home
then
followed
a
series
of
visits
to
all
sorts
of
places
of
amusement
duroy
soon
began
to
tire
of
those
expeditions
for
he
had
exhausted
all
his
resources
and
all
means
of
obtaining
money
in
addition
to
that
he
owed
forestier
a
hundred
francs
jacques
rival
three
hundred
and
he
was
hampered
with
innumerable
petty
debts
ranging
from
twenty
francs
to
one
hundred
sous
on
the
fourteenth
of
december
he
was
left
without
a
sou
in
his
pocket
as
he
had
often
done
before
he
did
not
lunch
and
spent
the
afternoon
working
at
the
office
at
four
he
received
a
telegram
from
mme
de
marelle
saying
shall
we
dine
together
and
afterward
have
a
frolic
he
replied
at
once
impossible
to
dine
then
he
added
but
i
will
expect
you
at
our
apartments
at
nine
having
sent
a
boy
with
the
note
in
order
to
save
the
money
for
a
telegram
he
tried
to
think
of
some
way
by
which
he
could
obtain
his
evening
meal
he
waited
until
all
of
his
associates
had
gone
and
when
he
was
alone
he
rang
for
the
porter
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
said
foucart
i
have
left
my
purse
at
home
and
i
have
to
dine
at
the
luxembourg
lend
me
fifty
sous
to
pay
for
my
cab
the
man
handed
him
three
francs
and
asked
is
that
enough
yes
thank
you
taking
the
coins
duroy
rushed
down
the
staircase
and
dined
at
a
cookshop
at
nine
mme
de
marelle
whom
he
awaited
in
the
tiny
salon
arrived
she
wished
to
take
a
walk
and
he
objected
his
opposition
irritated
her
i
shall
go
alone
then
adieu
seeing
that
the
situation
was
becoming
grave
he
seized
her
hands
and
kissed
them
saying
pardon
me
darling
i
am
nervous
and
out
of
sorts
this
evening
i
have
been
annoyed
by
business
matters
somewhat
appeased
but
still
vexed
she
replied
that
does
not
concern
me
i
will
not
be
the
butt
for
your
ill
humor
he
clasped
her
in
his
arms
and
murmured
his
apologies
still
she
persisted
in
her
desire
to
go
out
i
beseech
you
remain
here
by
the
fire
with
me
say
yes
no
she
replied
i
will
not
yield
to
your
caprices
he
insisted
i
have
a
reason
a
serious
reason
if
you
will
not
go
with
me
i
shall
go
alone
adieu
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
embrace
and
fled
to
the
door
he
followed
her
listen
clo
my
little
clo
listen
to
me
she
shook
her
head
evaded
his
caresses
and
tried
to
escape
from
his
encircling
arms
i
have
a
reason
looking
him
in
the
face
she
said
you
lie
what
is
it
he
colored
and
in
order
to
avoid
a
rupture
confessed
in
accents
of
despair
i
have
no
money
she
would
not
believe
him
until
he
had
turned
all
his
pockets
inside
out
to
prove
his
words
then
she
fell
upon
his
breast
oh
my
poor
darling
had
i
known
how
did
it
happen
he
invented
a
touching
story
to
this
effect
that
his
father
was
in
straitened
circumstances
that
he
had
given
him
not
only
his
savings
but
had
run
himself
into
debt
i
shall
have
to
starve
for
the
next
six
months
shall
i
lend
you
some
she
whispered
he
replied
with
dignity
you
are
very
kind
dearest
but
do
not
mention
that
again
it
wounds
me
she
murmured
you
will
never
know
how
much
i
love
you
on
taking
leave
of
him
she
asked
shall
we
meet
again
the
day
after
certainly
at
the
same
time
yes
my
darling
they
parted
when
duroy
opened
his
bedroom
door
and
fumbled
in
his
vest
pocket
for
a
match
he
was
amazed
to
find
in
it
a
piece
of
money
a
piece
at
first
he
wondered
by
what
miracle
it
had
got
there
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
mme
de
marelle
had
given
him
alms
angry
and
humiliated
he
determined
to
return
it
when
next
they
met
the
next
morning
it
was
late
when
he
awoke
he
tried
to
overcome
his
hunger
he
went
out
and
as
he
passed
the
restaurants
he
could
scarcely
resist
their
temptations
at
noon
he
said
bah
i
shall
lunch
upon
twenty
francs
that
will
not
hinder
me
from
returning
the
money
he
ate
his
lunch
for
which
he
paid
two
francs
fifty
and
on
entering
the
office
of
la
vie
francaise
he
repaid
the
porter
the
three
francs
he
had
borrowed
from
him
he
worked
until
seven
then
he
dined
and
he
continued
to
draw
upon
the
twenty
francs
until
only
four
francs
twenty
remained
he
decided
to
say
to
mme
de
marelle
upon
her
arrival
i
found
the
piece
you
slipped
into
my
pocket
i
will
not
return
the
money
but
i
will
repay
you
when
we
next
meet
when
madame
came
he
dared
not
broach
the
delicate
subject
they
spent
the
evening
together
and
appointed
their
next
meeting
for
wednesday
of
the
following
week
for
mme
de
marelle
had
a
number
of
engagements
duroy
continued
to
accept
money
from
clotilde
and
quieted
his
conscience
by
assuring
himself
i
will
give
it
back
in
a
lump
it
is
nothing
but
borrowed
money
anyway
so
he
kept
account
of
all
that
he
received
in
order
to
pay
it
back
some
day
one
evening
mme
de
marelle
said
to
him
would
you
believe
that
i
have
never
been
to
the
will
you
take
me
there
he
hesitated
fearing
a
meeting
with
rachel
then
he
thought
bah
i
am
not
married
after
all
if
she
should
see
me
she
would
take
in
the
situation
and
not
accost
me
moreover
we
would
have
a
box
when
they
entered
the
hall
it
was
crowded
with
difficulty
they
made
their
way
to
their
seats
mme
de
marelle
did
not
look
at
the
stage
she
was
interested
in
watching
the
women
who
were
promenading
and
she
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
touch
them
to
see
of
what
those
beings
were
made
suddenly
she
said
there
is
a
large
brunette
who
stares
at
us
all
the
time
i
think
every
minute
she
will
speak
to
us
have
you
seen
her
he
replied
no
you
are
mistaken
he
told
an
untruth
for
he
had
noticed
the
woman
who
was
no
other
than
rachel
with
anger
in
her
eyes
and
violent
words
upon
her
lips
duroy
had
passed
her
when
he
and
mme
de
marelle
entered
and
she
had
said
to
him
good
evening
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
wink
which
said
i
understand
but
he
had
not
replied
for
fear
of
being
seen
by
his
sweetheart
he
passed
her
coldly
disdainfully
the
woman
her
jealousy
aroused
followed
the
couple
and
said
in
a
louder
key
good
evening
georges
he
paid
no
heed
to
her
then
she
was
determined
to
be
recognized
and
she
remained
near
their
box
awaiting
a
favorable
moment
when
she
saw
that
she
was
observed
by
mme
de
marelle
she
touched
duroy
shoulder
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
and
said
good
evening
how
are
you
but
georges
did
not
turn
his
head
she
continued
have
you
grown
deaf
since
thursday
still
he
did
not
reply
she
laughed
angrily
and
cried
are
you
dumb
too
perhaps
madame
has
your
tongue
with
a
furious
glance
duroy
then
exclaimed
how
dare
you
accost
me
go
along
or
i
will
have
you
arrested
with
flaming
eyes
she
cried
ah
is
that
so
because
you
are
with
another
is
no
reason
that
you
can
not
recognize
me
if
you
had
made
the
least
sign
of
recognition
when
you
passed
me
i
would
not
have
molested
you
you
did
not
even
say
good
evening
to
me
when
you
met
me
during
that
tirade
mme
de
marelle
in
affright
opened
the
door
of
the
box
and
fled
through
the
crowd
seeking
an
exit
duroy
rushed
after
her
rachel
seeing
him
disappear
cried
stop
her
she
has
stolen
my
lover
two
men
seized
the
fugitive
by
the
shoulder
but
duroy
who
had
caught
up
with
her
bade
them
desist
and
together
he
and
clotilde
reached
the
street
they
entered
a
cab
the
cabman
asked
where
shall
i
drive
to
duroy
replied
where
you
will
clotilde
sobbed
hysterically
duroy
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
do
at
length
he
stammered
listen
clo
my
dearest
clo
let
me
explain
it
is
not
my
fault
i
knew
that
woman
long
ago
she
raised
her
head
and
with
the
fury
of
a
betrayed
woman
she
cried
disconnectedly
ah
you
miserable
fellow
what
a
rascal
you
are
is
it
possible
what
disgrace
oh
my
god
you
gave
her
my
money
did
you
not
i
gave
him
the
money
for
that
woman
oh
the
wretch
for
several
moments
she
seemed
to
be
vainly
seeking
an
epithet
more
forcible
suddenly
leaning
forward
she
grasped
the
cabman
sleeve
stop
she
cried
and
opening
the
door
she
alighted
georges
was
about
to
follow
her
but
she
commanded
i
forbid
you
to
follow
me
in
a
voice
so
loud
that
the
crowded
around
her
and
duroy
dared
not
stir
for
fear
of
a
scandal
she
drew
out
her
purse
and
taking
two
francs
fifty
from
it
she
handed
it
to
the
cabman
saying
aloud
here
is
the
money
for
your
hour
take
that
rascal
to
rue
boursault
at
batignolles
the
crowd
applauded
one
man
said
bravo
little
one
and
the
cab
moved
on
followed
by
the
jeers
of
the
bystanders
chapter
vi
a
step
upward
the
next
morning
georges
duroy
arose
dressed
himself
and
determined
to
have
money
he
sought
forestier
his
friend
received
him
in
his
study
what
made
you
rise
so
early
he
asked
a
very
serious
matter
i
have
a
debt
of
honor
a
gaming
debt
he
hesitated
then
repeated
a
gaming
debt
is
it
large
five
hundred
francs
he
only
needed
two
hundred
and
eighty
forestier
asked
sceptically
to
whom
do
you
owe
that
amount
duroy
did
not
reply
at
once
to
to
a
de
carleville
ah
where
does
he
live
rue
rue
forestier
laughed
i
know
the
gentleman
if
you
want
twenty
francs
you
can
have
them
but
no
more
duroy
took
the
called
upon
more
friends
and
by
five
had
collected
eighty
francs
as
he
required
two
hundred
more
he
kept
what
he
had
begged
and
muttered
i
shall
not
worry
about
it
i
will
pay
it
when
i
can
for
two
weeks
he
lived
economically
but
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
good
resolutions
he
had
formed
vanished
and
one
evening
he
returned
to
the
folies
bergeres
in
search
of
rachel
but
the
woman
was
implacable
and
heaped
coarse
insults
upon
him
until
he
felt
his
cheeks
tingle
and
he
left
the
hall
forestier
out
of
health
and
feeble
made
duroy
existence
at
the
office
insupportable
the
latter
did
not
reply
to
his
rude
remarks
but
determined
to
be
avenged
he
called
upon
mme
forestier
he
found
her
reclining
upon
a
couch
reading
she
held
out
her
hand
without
rising
and
said
good
morning
why
do
you
call
me
by
that
name
she
replied
with
a
smile
i
saw
mme
de
marelle
last
week
and
i
know
what
they
have
christened
you
at
her
house
he
took
a
seat
near
his
hostess
and
glanced
at
her
curiously
she
was
a
charming
blonde
fair
and
plump
made
for
caresses
and
he
thought
she
is
certainly
nicer
than
the
other
one
he
did
not
doubt
that
he
would
only
have
to
extend
his
hand
in
order
to
gather
the
fruit
as
he
gazed
upon
her
she
chided
him
for
his
neglect
of
her
he
replied
i
did
not
come
because
it
was
for
the
best
how
why
why
can
you
not
guess
no
because
i
loved
you
a
little
only
a
little
and
i
did
not
wish
to
love
you
any
more
she
did
not
seem
surprised
nor
flattered
she
smiled
indifferently
and
replied
calmly
oh
you
can
come
just
the
same
no
one
loves
me
long
why
not
because
it
is
useless
and
i
tell
them
so
at
once
if
you
had
confessed
your
fears
to
me
sooner
i
would
have
reassured
you
my
dear
friend
a
man
in
love
is
not
only
foolish
but
dangerous
i
cease
all
intercourse
with
people
who
love
me
or
pretend
to
firstly
because
they
bore
me
and
secondly
because
i
look
upon
them
with
dread
as
i
would
upon
a
mad
dog
i
know
that
your
love
is
only
a
kind
of
appetite
while
with
me
it
would
be
a
communion
of
souls
now
look
me
in
the
face
she
no
longer
smiled
i
will
never
be
your
sweetheart
it
is
therefore
useless
for
you
to
persist
in
your
efforts
and
now
that
i
have
explained
shall
we
be
friends
he
knew
that
that
sentence
was
irrevocable
and
delighted
to
be
able
to
form
such
an
alliance
as
she
proposed
he
extended
both
hands
saying
i
am
yours
madame
to
do
with
as
you
will
he
kissed
her
hands
and
raising
his
head
said
if
i
had
found
a
woman
like
you
how
gladly
would
i
have
married
her
she
was
touched
by
those
words
and
in
a
soft
voice
placing
her
hand
upon
his
arm
she
said
i
am
going
to
begin
my
offices
at
once
you
are
not
diplomatic
she
hesitated
may
i
speak
freely
yes
call
upon
mme
walter
who
has
taken
a
fancy
to
you
but
be
guarded
as
to
your
compliments
for
she
is
virtuous
you
will
make
a
better
impression
there
by
being
careful
in
your
remarks
i
know
that
your
position
at
the
office
is
unsatisfactory
but
do
not
worry
all
their
employees
are
treated
alike
he
said
thanks
you
are
an
angel
a
guardian
angel
as
he
took
his
leave
he
asked
again
are
we
friends
is
it
settled
it
is
having
observed
the
effect
of
his
last
compliment
he
said
if
you
ever
become
a
widow
i
have
put
in
my
application
then
he
left
the
room
hastily
in
order
not
to
allow
her
time
to
be
angry
duroy
did
not
like
to
call
on
mme
walter
for
he
had
never
been
invited
and
he
did
not
wish
to
commit
a
breach
of
etiquette
the
manager
had
been
kind
to
him
appreciated
his
services
employed
him
to
do
difficult
work
why
should
he
not
profit
by
that
show
of
favor
to
call
at
his
house
one
day
therefore
he
repaired
to
the
market
and
bought
pears
having
carefully
arranged
them
in
a
basket
to
make
them
appear
as
if
they
came
from
a
distance
he
took
them
to
mme
walter
door
with
his
card
on
which
was
inscribed
georges
duroy
begs
mme
walter
to
accept
the
fruit
which
he
received
this
morning
from
normandy
the
following
day
he
found
in
his
at
the
office
an
envelope
containing
mme
walter
card
on
which
was
written
mme
walter
thanks
georges
duroy
very
much
and
is
at
home
on
saturdays
the
next
saturday
he
called
walter
lived
on
boulevard
malesherbes
in
a
double
house
which
he
owned
the
were
on
the
first
floor
in
the
antechamber
were
two
footmen
one
took
duroy
overcoat
the
other
his
cane
put
it
aside
opened
a
door
and
announced
the
visitor
name
in
the
large
mirror
in
the
apartment
duroy
could
see
the
reflection
of
people
seated
in
another
room
he
passed
through
two
and
entered
a
small
boudoir
in
which
four
ladies
were
gathered
around
a
notwithstanding
the
assurance
he
had
gained
during
his
life
in
paris
and
especially
since
he
had
been
thrown
in
contact
with
so
many
noted
personages
duroy
felt
abashed
he
stammered
madame
i
took
the
liberty
the
mistress
of
the
house
extended
her
hand
and
said
to
him
you
are
very
kind
duroy
to
come
to
see
me
she
pointed
to
a
chair
the
ladies
chatted
on
visitors
came
and
went
mme
walter
noticed
that
duroy
said
nothing
that
no
one
addressed
him
that
he
seemed
disconcerted
and
she
drew
him
into
the
conversation
which
dealt
with
the
admission
of
a
certain
linet
to
the
academy
when
duroy
had
taken
his
leave
one
of
the
ladies
said
how
odd
he
is
who
is
he
mme
walter
replied
one
of
our
reporters
he
only
occupies
a
minor
position
but
i
think
he
will
advance
rapidly
in
the
meantime
while
he
was
being
discussed
duroy
walked
gaily
down
boulevard
malesherbes
the
following
week
he
was
appointed
editor
of
the
echoes
and
invited
to
dine
at
mme
walter
the
echoes
were
walter
said
the
very
pith
of
the
paper
everything
and
everybody
should
be
remembered
all
countries
all
professions
paris
and
the
provinces
the
army
the
arts
the
clergy
the
schools
the
rulers
and
the
courtiers
the
man
at
the
head
of
that
department
should
be
wide
awake
always
on
his
guard
quick
to
judge
of
what
was
best
to
be
said
and
best
to
be
omitted
to
divine
what
would
please
the
public
and
to
present
it
well
duroy
was
just
the
man
for
the
place
he
was
enjoying
the
fact
of
his
promotion
when
he
received
an
engraved
card
which
read
and
mme
walter
request
the
pleasure
of
georges
company
at
dinner
on
thursday
january
he
was
so
delighted
that
he
kissed
the
invitation
as
if
it
had
been
a
then
he
sought
the
cashier
to
settle
the
important
question
of
his
salary
at
first
twelve
hundred
francs
were
allowed
duroy
who
intended
to
save
a
large
share
of
the
money
he
was
busy
two
days
getting
settled
in
his
new
position
in
a
large
room
one
end
of
which
he
occupied
and
the
other
end
of
which
was
allotted
to
boisrenard
who
worked
with
him
the
day
of
the
he
left
the
office
in
good
season
in
order
to
have
time
to
dress
and
was
walking
along
rue
de
londres
when
he
saw
before
him
a
form
which
resembled
mme
de
marelle
he
felt
his
cheeks
glow
and
his
heart
throb
he
crossed
the
street
in
order
to
see
the
lady
face
he
was
mistaken
and
breathed
more
freely
he
had
often
wondered
what
he
should
do
if
he
met
clotilde
face
to
face
should
he
bow
to
her
or
pretend
not
to
see
her
i
should
not
see
her
thought
he
when
duroy
entered
his
rooms
he
thought
i
must
change
my
apartments
these
will
not
do
any
longer
he
felt
both
nervous
and
gay
and
said
aloud
to
himself
i
must
write
to
my
father
occasionally
he
wrote
home
and
his
letters
always
delighted
his
old
parents
as
he
tied
his
cravat
at
the
mirror
he
repeated
i
must
write
home
if
my
father
could
see
me
this
evening
in
the
house
to
which
i
am
going
he
would
be
surprised
sacristi
i
shall
soon
give
a
dinner
which
has
never
been
equaled
then
he
recalled
his
old
home
the
faces
of
his
father
and
mother
he
saw
them
seated
at
their
homely
board
eating
their
soup
he
remembered
every
wrinkle
on
their
old
faces
every
movement
of
their
hands
and
heads
he
even
knew
what
they
said
to
each
other
every
evening
as
they
supped
he
thought
i
will
go
to
see
them
some
day
his
toilette
completed
he
extinguished
his
light
and
descended
the
stairs
on
reaching
his
destination
he
boldly
entered
the
antechamber
lighted
by
bronze
lamps
and
gave
his
cane
and
his
overcoat
to
the
two
lackeys
who
approached
him
all
the
salons
were
lighted
mme
walter
received
in
the
second
the
largest
she
greeted
duroy
with
a
charming
smile
and
he
shook
hands
with
two
men
who
arrived
after
him
firmin
and
the
latter
had
especial
authority
at
the
office
on
account
of
his
influence
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
then
the
forestiers
arrived
madeleine
looking
charming
in
pink
charles
had
become
very
much
emaciated
and
coughed
incessantly
norbert
de
varenne
and
jacques
rival
came
together
a
door
opened
at
the
end
of
the
room
and
walter
entered
with
two
tall
young
girls
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
one
plain
the
other
pretty
duroy
knew
that
the
manager
was
a
paterfamilias
but
he
was
astonished
he
had
thought
of
the
manager
daughters
as
one
thinks
of
a
distant
country
one
will
never
see
then
too
he
had
fancied
them
children
and
he
saw
women
they
shook
hands
upon
being
introduced
and
seated
themselves
at
a
table
set
apart
for
them
one
of
the
guests
had
not
arrived
and
that
embarrassing
silence
which
precedes
dinners
in
general
reigned
supreme
duroy
happening
to
glance
at
the
walls
walter
said
you
are
looking
at
my
pictures
i
will
show
them
all
to
you
and
he
took
a
lamp
that
they
might
distinguish
all
the
details
there
were
landscapes
by
guillemet
a
visit
to
the
hospital
by
gervex
a
widow
by
bouguereau
an
execution
by
jean
paul
laurens
and
many
others
duroy
exclaimed
charming
charming
char
but
stopped
short
on
hearing
behind
him
the
voice
of
mme
de
marelle
who
had
just
entered
walter
continued
to
exhibit
and
explain
his
pictures
but
duroy
saw
nothing
heard
without
comprehending
mme
de
marelle
was
there
behind
him
what
should
he
do
if
he
greeted
her
might
she
not
turn
her
back
upon
him
or
utter
some
insulting
remark
if
he
did
not
approach
her
what
would
people
think
he
was
so
ill
at
ease
that
at
one
time
he
thought
he
should
feign
indisposition
and
return
home
the
pictures
had
all
been
exhibited
walter
placed
the
lamp
on
the
table
and
greeted
the
last
arrival
while
duroy
recommenced
alone
an
examination
of
the
canvas
as
if
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
what
should
he
do
he
heard
their
voices
and
their
conversation
mme
forestier
called
him
he
hastened
toward
her
it
was
to
introduce
him
to
a
friend
who
was
on
the
point
of
giving
a
fete
and
who
wanted
a
description
of
it
in
la
vie
francaise
he
stammered
certainly
madame
certainly
madame
de
marelle
was
very
near
him
he
dared
not
turn
to
go
away
suddenly
to
his
amazement
she
exclaimed
good
evening
do
you
not
remember
me
he
turned
upon
his
heel
hastily
she
stood
before
him
smiling
her
eyes
overflowing
with
roguishness
and
affection
she
offered
him
her
hand
he
took
it
doubtfully
fearing
some
perfidy
she
continued
calmly
what
has
become
of
you
one
never
sees
you
not
having
regained
his
he
murmured
i
have
had
a
great
deal
to
do
madame
a
great
deal
to
do
walter
has
given
me
another
position
and
the
duties
are
very
arduous
i
know
but
that
is
no
excuse
for
forgetting
your
friends
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
large
woman
decollette
with
red
arms
red
cheeks
and
attired
in
gay
colors
as
she
was
received
with
effusion
duroy
asked
mme
forestier
who
is
that
person
viscountess
de
percemur
whose
nom
de
plume
is
blanche
he
was
surprised
and
with
difficulty
restrained
a
burst
of
laughter
patte
blanche
i
fancied
her
a
young
woman
like
you
is
that
patte
blanche
ah
she
is
handsome
very
handsome
a
servant
appeared
at
the
door
and
announced
madame
is
served
duroy
was
placed
between
the
manager
plain
daughter
mlle
rose
and
mme
de
marelle
the
proximity
of
the
latter
embarrassed
him
somewhat
although
she
appeared
at
ease
and
conversed
with
her
usual
spirit
gradually
however
his
assurance
returned
and
before
the
meal
was
over
he
knew
that
their
relations
would
be
renewed
wishing
too
to
be
polite
to
his
employer
daughter
he
addressed
her
from
time
to
time
she
responded
as
her
mother
would
have
done
without
any
hesitation
as
to
what
she
should
say
at
walter
right
sat
viscountess
de
percemur
and
duroy
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
asked
mme
de
marelle
in
a
low
voice
do
you
know
the
one
who
signs
herself
rose
yes
perfectly
baroness
de
livar
is
she
like
the
countess
no
but
she
is
just
as
comical
she
is
sixty
years
old
has
false
curls
and
teeth
wit
of
the
time
of
the
restoration
and
toilettes
of
the
same
period
when
the
guests
returned
to
the
duroy
asked
mme
de
marelle
may
i
escort
you
home
no
why
not
because
who
is
my
neighbor
leaves
me
at
my
door
every
time
that
i
dine
here
when
shall
i
see
you
again
lunch
with
me
they
parted
without
another
word
duroy
did
not
remain
late
as
he
descended
the
staircase
he
met
norbert
de
varenne
who
was
likewise
going
away
the
old
poet
took
his
arm
fearing
no
rivalry
on
the
newspaper
their
work
being
essentially
different
he
was
very
friendly
to
the
young
man
shall
we
walk
along
together
i
shall
be
pleased
to
replied
duroy
the
streets
were
almost
deserted
that
night
at
first
the
two
men
did
not
speak
then
duroy
in
order
to
make
some
remark
said
that
looks
very
intelligent
the
old
poet
murmured
do
you
think
so
the
younger
man
hesitated
in
surprise
why
yes
is
he
not
considered
one
of
the
most
capable
men
in
the
chamber
that
may
be
in
a
kingdom
of
blind
men
the
blind
are
kings
all
those
people
are
divided
between
money
and
politics
they
are
pedants
to
whom
it
is
impossible
to
speak
of
anything
that
is
familiar
to
us
ah
it
is
difficult
to
find
a
man
who
is
liberal
in
his
ideas
i
have
known
several
they
are
dead
still
what
difference
does
a
little
more
or
a
little
less
genius
make
since
all
must
come
to
an
end
he
paused
and
duroy
said
with
a
smile
you
are
gloomy
sir
the
poet
replied
i
always
am
my
child
you
will
be
too
in
a
few
years
while
one
is
climbing
the
ladder
one
sees
the
top
and
feels
hopeful
but
when
one
has
reached
that
summit
one
sees
the
descent
and
the
end
which
is
death
it
is
slow
work
ascending
but
one
descends
rapidly
at
your
age
one
is
joyous
one
hopes
for
many
things
which
never
come
to
pass
at
mine
one
expects
nothing
but
death
duroy
laughed
egad
you
make
me
shudder
norbert
de
varenne
continued
you
do
not
understand
me
now
but
later
on
you
will
remember
what
i
have
told
you
we
breathe
sleep
drink
eat
work
and
then
die
the
end
of
life
is
death
what
do
you
long
for
love
a
few
kisses
and
you
will
be
powerless
money
what
for
to
gratify
your
desires
glory
what
comes
after
it
all
death
death
alone
is
certain
he
stopped
took
duroy
by
his
coat
collar
and
said
slowly
ponder
upon
all
that
young
man
think
it
over
for
days
months
and
years
and
you
will
see
life
from
a
different
standpoint
i
am
a
lonely
old
man
i
have
neither
father
mother
brother
sister
wife
children
nor
god
i
have
only
poetry
marry
my
friend
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
live
alone
at
my
age
it
is
so
lonesome
i
seem
to
have
no
one
upon
earth
when
one
is
old
it
is
a
comfort
to
have
children
when
they
reached
rue
de
bourgogne
the
poet
halted
before
a
high
house
rang
the
bell
pressed
duroy
hand
and
said
forget
what
i
have
said
to
you
young
man
and
live
according
to
your
age
adieu
with
those
words
he
disappeared
in
the
dark
corridor
duroy
felt
somewhat
depressed
on
leaving
varenne
but
on
his
way
a
perfumed
damsel
passed
by
him
and
recalled
to
his
mind
his
reconciliation
with
mme
de
marelle
how
delightful
was
the
realization
of
one
hopes
the
next
morning
he
arrived
at
his
door
somewhat
early
she
welcomed
him
as
if
there
had
been
no
rupture
and
said
as
she
kissed
him
you
do
not
know
how
annoyed
i
am
my
beloved
i
anticipated
a
delightful
honeymoon
and
now
my
husband
has
come
home
for
six
weeks
but
i
could
not
let
so
long
a
time
go
by
without
seeing
you
especially
after
our
little
disagreement
and
this
is
how
i
have
arranged
matters
come
to
dinner
monday
i
will
introduce
you
to
de
marelle
i
have
already
spoken
of
you
to
him
duroy
hesitated
in
perplexity
he
feared
he
might
betray
something
by
a
word
a
glance
he
stammered
no
i
would
rather
not
meet
your
husband
why
not
how
absurd
such
things
happen
every
day
i
did
not
think
you
so
foolish
very
well
i
will
come
to
dinner
monday
to
make
it
more
pleasant
i
will
have
the
forestiers
though
i
do
not
like
to
receive
company
at
home
on
monday
as
he
ascended
mme
de
marelle
staircase
he
felt
strangely
troubled
not
that
he
disliked
to
take
her
husband
hand
drink
his
wine
and
eat
his
bread
but
he
dreaded
something
he
knew
not
what
he
was
ushered
into
the
salon
and
he
waited
as
usual
then
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
man
with
a
white
beard
grave
and
precise
advanced
toward
him
and
said
courteously
my
wife
has
often
spoken
of
you
sir
i
am
charmed
to
make
your
acquaintance
duroy
tried
to
appear
cordial
and
shook
his
host
proffered
hand
with
exaggerated
energy
de
marelle
put
a
log
upon
the
fire
and
asked
have
you
been
engaged
in
journalism
a
long
time
duroy
replied
only
a
few
months
his
embarrassment
wearing
off
he
began
to
consider
the
situation
very
amusing
he
gazed
at
de
marelle
serious
and
dignified
and
felt
a
desire
to
laugh
aloud
at
that
moment
mme
de
marelle
entered
and
approached
duroy
who
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
dared
not
kiss
her
hand
laurine
entered
next
and
offered
her
brow
to
georges
her
mother
said
to
her
you
do
not
call
duroy
the
child
blushed
as
if
it
were
a
gross
indiscretion
to
reveal
her
secret
when
the
forestiers
arrived
duroy
was
startled
at
appearance
he
had
grown
thinner
and
paler
in
a
week
and
coughed
incessantly
he
said
they
would
leave
for
cannes
on
the
following
thursday
at
the
doctor
orders
they
did
not
stay
late
after
they
had
left
duroy
said
with
a
shake
of
his
head
he
will
not
live
long
mme
de
marelle
replied
calmly
no
he
is
doomed
he
was
a
lucky
man
to
obtain
such
a
wife
duroy
asked
does
she
help
him
very
much
she
does
all
the
work
she
is
well
posted
on
every
subject
and
she
always
gains
her
point
as
she
wants
it
and
when
she
wants
it
oh
she
is
as
maneuvering
as
anyone
she
is
a
treasure
to
a
man
who
wishes
to
succeed
georges
replied
she
will
marry
very
soon
again
i
have
no
doubt
yes
i
should
not
even
be
surprised
if
she
had
some
one
in
view
a
deputy
but
i
do
not
know
anything
about
it
de
marelle
said
impatiently
you
infer
so
many
things
that
i
do
not
like
we
should
never
interfere
in
the
affairs
of
others
everyone
should
make
that
a
rule
duroy
took
his
leave
with
a
heavy
heart
the
next
day
he
called
on
the
forestiers
and
found
them
in
the
midst
of
packing
charles
lay
upon
a
sofa
and
repeated
i
should
have
gone
a
month
ago
then
he
proceeded
to
give
duroy
innumerable
orders
although
everything
had
been
arranged
with
walter
when
georges
left
him
he
pressed
his
comrade
hand
and
said
well
old
fellow
we
shall
soon
meet
again
mme
forestier
accompanied
him
to
the
door
and
he
reminded
her
of
their
compact
we
are
friends
and
allies
are
we
not
if
you
should
require
my
services
in
any
way
do
not
hesitate
to
call
upon
me
send
me
a
dispatch
or
a
letter
and
i
will
obey
she
murmured
thank
you
i
shall
not
forget
as
duroy
descended
the
staircase
he
met
de
vaudrec
ascending
the
count
seemed
sad
perhaps
at
the
approaching
departure
the
journalist
bowed
the
count
returned
his
salutation
courteously
but
somewhat
haughtily
on
thursday
evening
the
forestiers
left
town
chapter
vii
a
duel
with
an
end
charles
absence
gave
duroy
a
more
important
position
on
la
vie
francaise
only
one
matter
arose
to
annoy
him
otherwise
his
sky
was
cloudless
an
insignificant
paper
la
plume
attacked
him
constantly
or
rather
attacked
the
editor
of
the
echoes
of
la
vie
francaise
jacques
rival
said
to
him
one
day
you
are
very
forbearing
what
should
i
do
it
is
no
direct
attack
but
one
afternoon
when
he
entered
the
office
boisrenard
handed
him
a
number
of
la
plume
see
here
is
another
unpleasant
remark
for
you
relative
to
what
to
the
arrest
of
one
dame
aubert
georges
took
the
paper
and
read
a
scathing
personal
denunciation
duroy
it
seems
had
written
an
item
claiming
that
dame
aubert
who
as
the
editor
of
la
plume
claimed
had
been
put
under
arrest
was
a
myth
the
latter
retaliated
by
accusing
duroy
of
receiving
bribes
and
of
suppressing
matter
that
should
be
published
as
entered
duroy
asked
him
have
you
seen
the
paragraph
in
plume
yes
and
i
have
just
come
from
dame
aubert
she
is
no
myth
but
she
has
not
been
arrested
that
report
has
no
foundation
duroy
went
at
once
to
walter
office
after
hearing
the
case
the
manager
bade
him
go
to
the
woman
house
himself
find
out
the
details
and
reply
to
the
article
duroy
set
out
upon
his
errand
and
on
his
return
to
the
office
wrote
the
following
an
anonymous
writer
in
plume
is
trying
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
me
on
the
subject
of
an
old
woman
who
he
claims
was
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct
which
i
deny
i
have
myself
seen
dame
aubert
who
is
sixty
years
old
at
least
she
told
me
the
particulars
of
her
dispute
with
a
butcher
as
to
the
weight
of
some
cutlets
which
dispute
necessitated
an
explanation
before
a
magistrate
that
is
the
whole
truth
in
a
nutshell
as
for
the
other
insinuations
i
scorn
them
one
never
should
reply
to
such
things
moreover
when
they
are
written
under
a
mask
georges
duroy
walter
and
jacques
rival
considered
that
sufficient
and
it
was
decided
that
it
should
be
published
in
that
day
issue
duroy
returned
home
rather
agitated
and
uneasy
what
would
this
opponent
reply
who
was
he
why
that
attack
he
passed
a
restless
night
when
he
his
article
in
the
paper
the
next
morning
he
thought
it
more
aggressive
in
print
than
it
was
in
writing
he
might
it
seemed
to
him
have
softened
certain
terms
he
was
excited
all
day
and
feverish
night
he
rose
early
to
obtain
an
issue
of
la
plume
which
should
contain
the
reply
to
his
note
he
ran
his
eyes
over
the
columns
and
at
first
saw
nothing
he
was
beginning
to
breathe
more
freely
when
these
words
met
his
eye
duroy
of
vie
francaise
gives
us
the
lie
in
doing
so
he
lies
he
owns
however
that
a
woman
named
aubert
exists
and
that
she
was
taken
before
a
magistrate
by
an
agent
two
words
only
remain
to
be
added
to
the
word
which
are
morals
and
all
is
told
but
the
consciences
of
certain
journalists
are
on
a
par
with
their
talents
i
sign
myself
louis
langremont
georges
heart
throbbed
violently
and
he
returned
home
in
order
to
dress
himself
he
had
been
insulted
and
in
such
a
manner
that
it
was
impossible
to
hesitate
why
had
he
been
insulted
for
nothing
on
account
of
an
old
woman
who
had
quarreled
with
her
butcher
he
dressed
hastily
and
repaired
to
walter
house
although
it
was
scarcely
eight
walter
was
reading
la
plume
well
he
said
gravely
on
perceiving
duroy
you
can
not
let
that
pass
the
young
man
did
not
reply
the
manager
continued
go
at
once
in
search
of
rival
who
will
look
after
your
interests
duroy
stammered
several
vague
words
and
set
out
for
rival
house
jacques
was
still
in
bed
but
he
rose
when
the
bell
rang
and
having
read
the
insulting
paragraph
said
whom
would
you
like
to
have
besides
me
i
do
not
know
boisrenard
yes
are
you
a
good
swordsman
no
a
good
shot
i
have
used
a
pistol
a
good
deal
good
come
and
exercise
while
i
attend
to
everything
wait
a
moment
he
entered
his
and
soon
reappeared
washed
shaven
and
presentable
come
with
me
said
he
he
lived
on
the
ground
floor
and
he
led
duroy
into
a
cellar
converted
into
a
room
for
the
practice
of
fencing
and
shooting
he
produced
a
pair
of
pistols
and
began
to
give
his
orders
as
briefly
as
if
they
were
on
the
dueling
ground
he
was
well
satisfied
with
duroy
use
of
the
weapons
and
told
him
to
remain
there
and
practice
until
noon
when
he
would
return
to
take
him
to
lunch
and
tell
him
the
result
of
his
mission
left
to
his
own
devices
duroy
aimed
at
the
target
several
times
and
then
sat
down
to
reflect
such
affairs
were
abominable
anyway
what
would
a
respectable
man
gain
by
risking
his
life
and
he
recalled
norbert
de
varenne
remarks
made
to
him
a
short
while
before
he
was
right
he
declared
aloud
it
was
gloomy
in
that
cellar
as
gloomy
as
in
a
tomb
what
was
it
the
time
dragged
slowly
on
suddenly
he
heard
footsteps
voices
and
jacques
rival
reappeared
accompanied
by
boisrenard
the
former
cried
on
perceiving
duroy
all
is
settled
duroy
thought
the
matter
had
terminated
with
a
letter
of
apology
his
heart
gave
a
bound
and
he
stammered
ah
thank
you
rival
continued
langremont
has
accepted
every
condition
paces
fire
when
the
pistol
is
leveled
and
the
order
given
then
he
added
now
let
us
lunch
it
is
past
twelve
they
repaired
to
a
neighboring
restaurant
duroy
was
silent
he
ate
that
they
might
not
think
he
was
frightened
and
went
in
the
afternoon
with
boisrenard
to
the
office
where
he
worked
in
an
absent
mechanical
manner
before
leaving
jacques
rival
shook
hands
with
him
and
warned
him
that
he
and
boisrenard
would
call
for
him
in
a
carriage
the
next
morning
at
seven
to
repair
to
the
wood
at
vesinet
where
the
meeting
was
to
take
place
all
had
been
settled
without
his
saying
a
word
giving
his
opinion
accepting
or
refusing
with
such
rapidity
that
his
brain
whirled
and
he
scarcely
knew
what
was
taking
place
he
returned
home
about
nine
in
the
evening
after
having
dined
with
boisrenard
who
had
not
left
him
all
day
when
he
was
alone
he
paced
the
floor
he
was
too
confused
to
think
one
thought
alone
filled
his
mind
and
that
was
a
duel
he
sat
down
and
began
to
meditate
he
had
thrown
upon
his
table
his
adversary
card
brought
him
by
rival
he
read
it
for
the
twentieth
time
that
day
louis
langremont
rue
montmartre
nothing
more
who
was
the
man
how
old
was
he
how
tall
how
did
he
look
how
odious
that
a
total
stranger
should
without
rhyme
or
reason
out
of
pure
caprice
annoy
him
thus
on
account
of
an
old
quarrel
with
her
butcher
he
said
aloud
the
brute
and
glared
angrily
at
the
card
he
began
to
feel
nervous
the
sound
of
his
voice
made
him
start
he
drank
a
glass
of
water
and
laid
down
he
turned
from
his
right
side
to
his
left
uneasily
he
was
thirsty
he
rose
he
felt
restless
am
i
afraid
he
asked
himself
why
did
his
heart
palpitate
so
wildly
at
the
slightest
sound
he
began
to
reason
philosophically
on
the
possibility
of
being
afraid
no
certainly
he
was
not
since
he
was
ready
to
fight
still
he
felt
so
deeply
moved
that
he
wondered
if
one
could
be
afraid
in
spite
of
oneself
what
would
happen
if
that
state
of
things
should
exist
if
he
should
tremble
or
lose
his
presence
of
mind
he
lighted
his
candle
and
looked
in
the
glass
he
scarcely
recognized
his
own
face
it
was
so
changed
suddenly
he
thought
at
this
time
i
may
be
dead
he
turned
to
his
couch
and
saw
himself
stretched
lifeless
upon
it
he
hastened
to
the
window
and
opened
it
but
the
night
air
was
so
chilly
that
he
closed
it
lighted
a
fire
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
once
more
saying
mechanically
i
must
be
more
composed
i
will
write
to
my
parents
in
case
of
accident
he
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
after
several
attempts
began
my
dear
father
and
mother
at
daybreak
i
am
going
to
fight
a
duel
and
as
something
might
happen
he
could
write
no
more
he
rose
with
a
shudder
it
seemed
to
him
that
notwithstanding
his
efforts
he
would
not
have
the
strength
necessary
to
face
the
meeting
he
wondered
if
his
adversary
had
ever
fought
before
if
he
were
known
he
had
never
heard
his
name
however
if
he
had
not
been
a
remarkable
shot
he
would
not
have
accepted
that
dangerous
weapon
without
hesitation
he
ground
his
teeth
to
prevent
his
crying
aloud
suddenly
he
remembered
that
he
had
a
bottle
of
brandy
he
fetched
it
from
the
cupboard
and
soon
emptied
it
now
he
felt
his
blood
course
more
warmly
through
his
veins
i
have
found
a
means
said
he
day
broke
he
began
to
dress
when
his
heart
failed
him
he
took
more
brandy
at
length
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
his
friends
had
come
they
were
wrapped
in
furs
after
shaking
hands
rival
said
it
is
as
cold
as
siberia
is
all
well
yes
are
you
calm
very
calm
have
you
eaten
and
drunk
something
i
do
not
need
anything
they
descended
the
stairs
a
gentleman
was
seated
in
the
carriage
rival
said
dr
le
brument
duroy
shook
hands
with
him
and
stammered
thank
you
as
he
entered
the
carriage
jacques
rival
and
boisrenard
followed
him
and
the
coachman
drove
off
he
knew
where
to
go
the
conversation
flagged
although
the
doctor
related
a
number
of
anecdotes
rival
alone
replied
to
him
duroy
tried
to
appear
but
he
was
haunted
continually
by
the
fear
of
showing
his
feelings
or
of
losing
his
rival
addressed
him
saying
i
took
the
pistols
to
gastine
renette
he
loaded
them
the
box
is
sealed
duroy
replied
mechanically
thank
you
then
rival
proceeded
to
give
him
minute
directions
that
he
might
make
no
mistakes
duroy
repeated
those
directions
as
children
learn
their
lessons
in
order
to
impress
them
upon
his
memory
as
he
muttered
the
phrases
over
and
over
he
almost
prayed
that
some
accident
might
happen
to
the
carriage
if
he
could
only
break
his
leg
at
the
end
of
a
glade
he
saw
a
carriage
standing
and
four
gentlemen
stamping
their
feet
in
order
to
keep
them
warm
and
he
was
obliged
to
gasp
in
order
to
get
breath
rival
and
boisrenard
alighted
first
then
the
doctor
and
the
combatant
rival
took
the
box
of
pistols
and
with
boisrenard
approached
the
two
strangers
who
were
advancing
toward
them
duroy
saw
them
greet
one
another
ceremoniously
then
walk
through
the
glade
together
as
they
counted
the
paces
dr
le
brument
asked
duroy
do
you
feel
well
do
you
not
want
anything
nothing
thank
you
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
asleep
that
he
was
dreaming
was
he
afraid
he
did
not
know
jacques
rival
returned
and
said
in
a
low
voice
all
is
ready
fortune
has
favored
us
in
the
drawing
of
the
pistols
that
was
a
matter
of
indifference
to
duroy
they
helped
him
off
with
his
overcoat
led
him
to
the
ground
set
apart
for
the
duel
and
gave
him
his
pistol
before
him
stood
a
man
short
stout
and
bald
who
wore
glasses
that
was
his
adversary
a
voice
broke
the
silence
a
voice
which
came
from
afar
are
you
ready
sirs
georges
cried
yes
the
same
voice
commanded
fire
duroy
heard
nothing
more
saw
nothing
more
he
only
knew
that
he
raised
his
arm
and
pressed
with
all
his
strength
upon
the
trigger
soon
he
saw
a
little
smoke
before
him
his
opponent
was
still
standing
in
the
same
position
and
there
was
a
small
white
cloud
above
his
head
they
had
both
fired
all
was
over
his
second
and
the
doctor
felt
him
unbuttoned
his
garments
and
asked
anxiously
are
you
wounded
he
replied
no
i
think
not
langremont
was
not
wounded
either
and
jacques
rival
muttered
discontentedly
that
is
always
the
way
with
those
cursed
pistols
one
either
misses
or
kills
one
opponent
duroy
was
paralyzed
with
surprise
and
joy
all
was
over
he
felt
that
he
could
fight
the
entire
universe
all
was
over
what
bliss
he
felt
brave
enough
to
provoke
anyone
the
seconds
consulted
several
moments
then
the
duelists
and
their
friends
entered
the
carriages
and
drove
off
when
the
official
report
was
drawn
up
it
was
handed
to
duroy
who
was
to
insert
it
in
the
echoes
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
two
balls
had
been
fired
he
said
to
rival
we
only
fired
once
the
latter
smiled
yes
once
once
each
that
makes
twice
and
duroy
satisfied
with
that
explanation
asked
no
more
questions
walter
embraced
him
bravo
you
have
defended
the
colors
of
vie
francaise
bravo
the
following
day
at
eleven
in
the
forenoon
duroy
received
a
telegram
my
god
i
have
been
frightened
come
at
once
to
rue
de
constantinople
that
i
may
embrace
you
my
love
how
brave
you
are
i
adore
you
clo
he
repaired
to
the
place
appointed
and
mme
de
marelle
rushed
into
his
arms
covering
him
with
kisses
oh
my
darling
if
you
only
knew
how
i
felt
when
i
read
the
morning
papers
tell
me
tell
me
all
about
it
duroy
was
obliged
to
give
her
a
detailed
account
you
must
have
had
a
terrible
night
before
the
duel
why
no
i
slept
very
well
i
should
not
have
closed
my
eyes
tell
me
what
took
place
on
the
ground
forthwith
he
proceeded
to
give
her
a
graphic
description
of
the
duel
when
he
had
concluded
she
said
to
him
i
can
not
live
without
you
i
must
see
you
and
with
my
husband
in
paris
it
is
not
very
convenient
i
often
have
an
hour
early
in
the
morning
when
i
could
come
and
embrace
you
but
i
can
not
enter
that
horrible
house
of
yours
what
can
we
do
he
asked
abruptly
how
much
do
you
pay
here
one
hundred
francs
a
month
very
well
i
will
take
the
apartments
on
my
own
account
and
i
will
move
at
once
mine
are
not
suitable
anyway
for
me
now
she
thought
a
moment
and
then
replied
no
i
do
not
want
you
to
he
asked
in
surprise
why
not
because
that
is
no
reason
these
rooms
suit
me
very
well
i
am
here
i
shall
remain
he
laughed
moreover
they
were
hired
in
my
name
but
she
persisted
no
no
i
do
not
wish
you
to
why
not
then
she
whispered
softly
tenderly
because
you
would
bring
others
here
and
i
do
not
wish
you
to
indignantly
he
cried
never
i
promise
you
you
would
do
so
in
spite
of
your
promise
i
swear
i
will
not
truly
truly
upon
my
word
of
honor
this
is
our
nest
ours
alone
she
embraced
him
in
a
transport
of
delight
then
i
agree
my
dearest
but
if
you
deceive
me
once
just
once
that
will
end
all
between
us
forever
he
protested
and
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
settle
in
the
rooms
that
same
day
she
said
to
him
you
must
dine
with
us
sunday
my
husband
thinks
you
charming
he
was
flattered
indeed
yes
you
have
made
a
conquest
did
you
not
tell
me
that
your
home
was
in
the
country
yes
why
then
you
know
something
about
agriculture
yes
very
well

to
him
of
gardening
and
crops
he
enjoys
those
subjects
all
right
i
shall
not
forget
she
left
him
after
lavishing
upon
him
innumerable
caresses
chapter
viii
death
and
a
proposal
duroy
moved
his
effects
to
the
apartments
in
rue
de
constantinople
two
or
three
times
a
week
mme
paid
him
visits
duroy
to
counterbalance
them
dined
at
her
house
every
thursday
and
delighted
her
husband
by
talking
agriculture
to
him
it
was
almost
the
end
of
february
duroy
was
free
from
care
one
night
when
he
returned
home
he
found
a
letter
under
his
door
he
examined
the
postmark
it
was
from
cannes
having
opened
it
he
read
cannes
villa
jolie

during
charles
last
moments

may
not

week
although
he
is
not
confined
to
his
bed
but
the
doctor
has
warned
me
i
have
not
the
strength
nor
the
courage
to
see
that
agony
day
and
night
and
i
think
with
terror
of
the
approaching
end
i
can
only
ask
such
a
thing
of
you
for
my
husband

no
relatives
you
were
his
comrade

helped
you
to
your
position

ask
your
friend
madeleine
forestier
georges
murmured
certainly
i
will
go
poor
charles
the
manager
to
whom
he
communicated
the
contents
of
that
letter
grumblingly
gave
his
consent
he
repeated
but
return
speedily
you
are
indispensable
to
us
georges
duroy
left
for
cannes
the
next
day
by
the
seven
express
after
having
warned
mme
de
marelle
by
telegram
he
arrived
the
following
day
at
four
in
the
afternoon
a
commissionnaire
conducted
him
to
villa
jolie
the
house
was
small
and
low
and
of
the
italian
style
of
architecture
a
servant
opened
the
door
and
cried
oh
sir
madame
is
awaiting
you
patiently
duroy
asked
how
is
your
master
not
very
well
sir
he
will
not
be
here
long
the
floor
of
the
which
the
young
man
entered
was
covered
with
a
persian
rug
the
large
windows
looked
upon
the
village
and
the
sea
duroy
murmured
how
cozy
it
is
here
where
the
deuce
do
they
get
the
money
from
the
rustling
of
a
gown
caused
him
to
turn
mme
forestier
extended
both
her
hands
saying
how
kind
of
you
to
come
she
was
a
trifle
paler
and
thinner
but
still
as
bright
as
ever
and
perhaps
prettier
for
being
more
delicate
she
whispered
it
is
terrible
he
knows
he
can
not
be
saved
and
he
tyrannizes
over
me
i
have
told
him
of
your
arrival
but
where
is
your
trunk
duroy
replied
i
left
it
at
the
station
not
knowing
which
hotel
you
would
advise
me
to
stop
at
in
order
to
be
near
you
she
hesitated
then
said
you
must
stop
here
at
the
villa
your
chamber
is
ready
he
might
die
any
moment
and
if
it
should
come
in
the
night
i
would
be
alone
i
will
send
for
your
luggage
he
bowed
as
you
will
now
let
us
go
upstairs
said
she
he
followed
her
she
opened
a
door
on
the
first
floor
and
duroy
saw
a
form
near
a
window
seated
in
an
and
wrapped
in
coverlets
he
divined
that
it
was
his
friend
though
he
scarcely
recognized
him
forestier
raised
his
hand
slowly
and
with
difficulty
saying
you
are
here
you
have
come
to
see
me
die
i
am
much
obliged
duroy
forced
a
smile
to
see
you
die
that
would
not
be
a
very
pleasant
sight
and
i
would
not
choose
that
occasion
on
which
to
visit
cannes
i
came
here
to
rest
sit
down
said
forestier
and
he
bowed
his
head
as
if
deep
in
hopeless
meditation
seeing
that
he
did
not
speak
his
wife
approached
the
window
and
pointing
to
the
horizon
said
look
at
that
is
it
not
beautiful
in
spite
of
himself
duroy
felt
the
grandeur
of
the
closing
day
and
exclaimed
yes
indeed
it
is
magnificent
forestier
raised
his
head
and
said
to
his
wife
give
me
more
air
she
replied
you
must
be
careful
it
is
late
the
sun
is
setting
you
will
catch
more
cold
and
that
would
be
a
serious
thing
in
your
condition
he
made
a
feeble
gesture
of
anger
with
his
right
hand
and
said
i
tell
you
i
am
suffocating
what
difference
does
it
make
if
i
die
a
day
sooner
or
later
since
i
must
die
she
opened
the
window
wide
the
air
was
soft
and
balmy
forestier
inhaled
it
in
feverish
gasps
he
grasped
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
said
in
a
low
voice
shut
the
window
i
would
rather
die
in
a
cellar
his
wife
slowly
closed
the
window
then
leaned
her
brow
against
the
pane
and
looked
out
duroy
ill
at
ease
wished
to
converse
with
the
invalid
to
reassure
him
but
he
could
think
of
no
words
of
comfort
he
stammered
have
you
not
been
better
since
you
are
here
his
friend
shrugged
his
shoulders
impatiently
you
will
see
very
soon
and
he
bowed
his
head
again
duroy
continued
at
home
it
is
still
wintry
it
snows
hails
rains
and
is
so
dark
that
they
have
to
light
the
lamps
at
three
in
the
afternoon
forestier
asked
is
there
anything
new
at
the
office
nothing
they
have
taken
little
lacrin
of
the
to
fill
your
place
but
he
is
incapable
it
is
time
you
came
back
the
invalid
muttered
i
i
will
soon
be
writing
under
six
feet
of
sod
a
long
silence
ensued
mme
forestier
did
not
stir
she
stood
with
her
back
to
the
room
her
face
toward
the
window
at
length
forestier
broke
the
silence
in
a
gasping
voice
heartrending
to
listen
to
how
many
more
sunsets
shall
i
see
eight
ten
fifteen
twenty
or
perhaps
thirty
no
more
you
have
more
time
you
two
as
for
me
all
is
at
an
end
and
everything
will
go
on
when
i
am
gone
as
if
i
were
here
he
paused
a
few
moments
then
continued
everything
that
i
see
reminds
me
that
i
shall
not
see
them
long
it
is
horrible
i
shall
no
longer
see
the
smallest
objects
the
glasses
the
dishes
the
beds
on
which
we
rest
the
carriages
it
is
fine
to
drive
in
the
evening
how
i
loved
all
that
again
norbert
de
varenne
words
occurred
to
duroy
the
room
grew
dark
forestier
asked
irritably
are
we
to
have
no
lamp
that
is
what
is
called
caring
for
an
invalid
the
form
outlined
against
the
window
disappeared
and
an
electric
bell
was
heard
to
ring
a
servant
soon
entered
and
placed
a
lamp
upon
the
mme
forestier
asked
her
husband
do
you
wish
to
retire
or
will
you
go
downstairs
to
dinner
i
will
go
down
to
dinner
the
meal
seemed
to
duroy
interminable
for
there
was
no
conversation
only
the
ticking
of
a
clock
broke
the
silence
when
they
had
finished
duroy
pleading
fatigue
retired
to
his
room
and
tried
in
vain
to
invent
some
pretext
for
returning
home
as
quickly
as
possible
he
consoled
himself
by
saying
perhaps
it
will
not
be
for
long
the
next
morning
georges
rose
early
and
strolled
down
to
the
beach
when
he
returned
the
servant
said
to
him
monsieur
has
asked
for
you
two
or
three
times
will
you
go
upstairs
he
ascended
the
stairs
forestier
appeared
to
be
in
a
chair
his
wife
reclining
upon
a
couch
was
reading
the
invalid
raised
his
head
duroy
asked
well
how
are
you
you
look
better
this
morning
forestier
murmured
yes
i
am
better
and
stronger
lunch
as
hastily
as
you
can
with
madeleine
because
we
are
going
to
take
a
drive
when
mme
forestier
was
alone
with
duroy
she
said
to
him
you
see
he
thinks
he
is
better
he
is
making
plans
for
we
are
now
going
to
gulf
juan
to
buy
pottery
for
our
rooms
in
paris
he
is
determined
to
go
but
he
can
not
stand
the
jolting
on
the
road
the
carriage
arrived
forestier
descended
the
stairs
step
by
step
supported
by
his
servant
when
he
saw
the
closed
landau
he
wanted
it
uncovered
his
wife
opposed
him
it
is
sheer
madness
you
will
take
cold
he
persisted
no
i
am
going
to
be
better
i
know
it
they
first
drove
along
a
shady
road
and
then
took
the
road
by
the
sea
forestier
explained
the
different
points
of
interest
finally
they
arrived
at
a
pavilion
over
which
were
these
words
gulf
juan
art
pottery
and
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
door
forestier
wanted
to
buy
a
vase
to
put
on
his
bookcase
as
he
could
not
leave
the
carriage
they
brought
the
pieces
to
him
one
by
one
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
choose
consulting
his
wife
and
duroy
you
know
it
is
for
my
study
from
my
i
can
see
it
constantly
i
prefer
the
ancient
form
the
greek
at
length
he
made
his
choice
i
shall
return
to
paris
in
a
few
days
said
he
on
their
way
home
along
the
gulf
a
cool
breeze
suddenly
sprang
up
and
the
invalid
began
to
cough
at
first
it
was
nothing
only
a
slight
attack
but
it
grew
worse
and
turned
to
a
sort
of
hiccough
a
rattle
forestier
choked
and
every
time
he
tried
to
breathe
he
coughed
violently
nothing
quieted
him
he
had
to
be
carried
from
the
landau
to
his
room
the
heat
of
the
bed
did
not
stop
the
attack
which
lasted
until
midnight
the
first
words
the
sick
man
uttered
were
to
ask
for
a
barber
for
he
insisted
on
being
shaved
every
morning
he
rose
to
be
shaved
but
was
obliged
to
go
to
bed
at
once
and
began
to
breathe
so
painfully
that
mme
forestier
in
affright
woke
duroy
and
asked
him
to
fetch
the
doctor
he
returned
almost
immediately
with
gavant
who
prescribed
for
the
sick
man
when
the
journalist
asked
him
his
opinion
he
said
it
is
the
final
stage
he
will
be
dead
morning
prepare
that
poor
young
wife
and
send
for
a
priest
i
can
do
nothing
more
however
i
am
entirely
at
your
disposal
duroy
went
to
mme
forestier
he
is
going
to
die
the
doctor
advises
me
to
send
for
a
priest
what
will
you
do
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
said
slowly
i
will
go
and
tell
him
that
the
cure
wishes
to
see
him
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
procure
one
who
will
require
nothing
but
the
confession
and
who
will
not
make
much
fuss
the
young
man
brought
with
him
a
kind
old
priest
who
accommodated
himself
to
circumstances
when
he
had
entered
the
death
chamber
mme
forestier
went
out
and
seated
herself
with
duroy
in
an
adjoining
room
that
has
upset
him
said
she
when
i
mentioned
the
priest
to
him
his
face
assumed
a
scared
expression
he
knew
that
the
end
was
near
i
shall
never
forget
his
face
at
that
moment
they
heard
the
priest
saying
to
him
why
no
you
are
not
so
low
as
that
you
are
ill
but
not
in
danger
the
proof
of
that
is
that
i
came
as
a
friend
a
neighbor
they
could
not
hear
his
reply
the
priest
continued
no
i
shall
not
administer
the
sacrament
we
will
speak
of
that
when
you
are
better
if
you
will
only
confess
i
ask
no
more
i
am
a
pastor
i
take
advantage
of
every
occasion
to
gather
in
my
sheep
a
long
silence
followed
then
suddenly
the
priest
said
in
the
tone
of
one
officiating
at
the
altar
the
mercy
of
god
is
infinite
repeat
the
my
son
perhaps
you
have
forgotten
it
i
will
help
you
repeat
with
me
deo
omnipotenti
beata
mariae
semper
virgini
he
paused
from
time
to
time
to
permit
the
dying
man
to
catch
up
to
him
then
he
said
now
confess
the
sick
man
murmured
something
the
priest
repeated
you
have
committed
sins
of
what
kind
my
son
the
young
woman
rose
and
said
simply
let
us
go
into
the
garden
we
must
not
listen
to
his
secrets
they
seated
themselves
upon
a
bench
before
the
door
beneath
a
blossoming
rosebush
after
several
moments
of
silence
duroy
asked
will
it
be
some
time
before
you
return
to
paris
no
she
replied
when
all
is
over
i
will
go
back
in
about
ten
days
yes
at
most
he
continued
charles
has
no
relatives
then
none
save
cousins
his
father
and
mother
died
when
he
was
very
young
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
the
servant
came
to
tell
them
that
the
priest
had
finished
and
together
they
ascended
the
stairs
forestier
seemed
to
have
grown
thinner
since
the
preceding
day
the
priest
was
holding
his
hand
au
revoir
my
son
i
will
come
again
morning
and
he
left
when
he
was
gone
the
dying
man
who
was
panting
tried
to
raise
his
two
hands
toward
his
wife
and
gasped
save
me
save
me
my
darling
i
do
not
want
to
die
oh
save
me
go
for
the
doctor
i
will
take
anything
i
do
not
want
to
die
he
wept
the
tears
coursed
down
his
pallid
cheeks
then
his
hands
commenced
to
wander
hither
and
thither
continually
slowly
and
regularly
as
if
gathering
something
on
the
coverlet
his
wife
who
was
also
weeping
sobbed
no
it
is
nothing
it
is
only
an
attack
you
will
be
better
you
tired
yourself
with
that
drive
forestier
drew
his
breath
quickly
and
so
faintly
that
one
could
scarcely
hear
him
he
repeated
i
do
not
want
to
die
oh
my
god
my
god
what
has
happened
to
me
i
can
not
see
oh
my
god
his
staring
eyes
saw
something
invisible
to
the
others
his
hands
plucked
continually
at
the
counterpane
suddenly
he
shuddered
and
gasped
the
cemetery
me
my
god
he
did
not
speak
again
he
lay
there
motionless
and
ghastly
the
hours
dragged
on
the
clock
of
a
neighboring
convent
chimed
noon
duroy
left
the
room
to
obtain
some
food
he
returned
an
hour
later
mme
forestier
would
eat
nothing
the
invalid
had
not
stirred
the
young
woman
was
seated
in
an
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
duroy
likewise
seated
himself
and
they
watched
in
silence
a
nurse
sent
by
the
doctor
had
arrived
and
was
dozing
by
the
window
duroy
himself
was
almost
asleep
when
he
felt
a
presentiment
that
something
was
about
to
happen
he
opened
his
eyes
just
in
time
to
see
forestier
close
his
he
coughed
slightly
and
two
streams
of
blood
issued
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
flowed
upon
his
night
robe
his
hands
ceased
their
perpetual
motion
he
had
breathed
his
last
his
wife
perceiving
it
uttered
a
cry
and
fell
upon
her
knees
by
the
bedside
georges
in
surprise
and
affright
mechanically
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
nurse
awakening
approached
the
bed
and
said
it
has
come
duroy
recovering
his
murmured
with
a
sigh
of
relief
it
was
not
as
hard
as
i
feared
it
would
be
that
night
mme
forestier
and
duroy
watched
in
the
chamber
of
death
they
were
alone
beside
him
who
was
no
more
they
did
not
speak
georges
eyes
seemed
attracted
to
that
emaciated
face
which
the
flickering
light
made
more
hollow
that
was
his
friend
charles
forestier
who
the
day
before
had
spoken
to
him
for
several
years
he
had
lived
eaten
laughed
loved
and
hoped
as
did
everyone
and
now
all
was
ended
for
him
forever
life
lasted
a
few
months
or
years
and
then
fled
one
was
born
grew
was
happy
and
died
adieu
man
or
woman
you
will
never
return
to
earth
he
thought
of
the
insects
which
live
several
hours
of
the
feasts
which
live
several
days
of
the
men
who
live
several
years
of
the
worlds
which
last
several
centuries
what
was
the
difference
between
one
and
the
other
a
few
more
dawns
that
was
all
duroy
turned
away
his
eyes
in
order
not
to
see
the
corpse
mme
forestier
head
was
bowed
her
fair
hair
enhanced
the
beauty
of
her
sorrowful
face
the
young
man
heart
grew
hopeful
why
should
he
lament
when
he
had
so
many
years
still
before
him
he
glanced
at
the
handsome
widow
how
had
she
ever
consented
to
marry
that
man
then
he
pondered
upon
all
the
hidden
secrets
of
their
lives
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
told
of
a
count
de
vaudrec
who
had
dowered
and
given
her
in
marriage
what
would
she
do
now
whom
would
she
marry
had
she
projects
plans
he
would
have
liked
to
know
why
that
anxiety
as
to
what
she
would
do
georges
questioned
himself
and
found
that
it
was
caused
by
a
desire
to
win
her
for
himself
why
should
he
not
succeed
he
was
positive
that
she
liked
him
she
would
have
confidence
in
him
for
she
knew
that
he
was
intelligent
resolute
tenacious
had
she
not
sent
for
him
was
not
that
a
kind
of
avowal
he
was
impatient
to
question
her
to
find
out
her
intentions
he
would
soon
have
to
leave
that
villa
for
he
could
not
remain
alone
with
the
young
widow
therefore
he
must
find
out
her
plans
before
returning
to
paris
in
order
that
she
might
not
yield
to
another
entreaties
he
broke
the
oppressive
silence
by
saying
you
must
be
fatigued
yes
but
above
all
i
am
grieved
their
voices
sounded
strange
in
that
room
they
glanced
involuntarily
at
the
corpse
as
if
they
expected
to
see
it
move
duroy
continued
it
is
a
heavy
blow
for
you
and
will
make
a
complete
change
in
your
life
she
sighed
deeply
but
did
not
reply
he
added
it
is
very
sad
for
a
young
woman
like
you
to
be
left
alone
he
paused
she
still
did
not
reply
and
he
stammered
at
any
rate
you
will
remember
the
compact
between
us
you
can
command
me
as
you
will
i
am
yours
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
said
mournfully
and
gently
thanks
you
are
very
kind
if
i
can
do
anything
for
you
i
say
too
on
me
he
took
her
proffered
hand
gazed
at
it
and
was
seized
with
an
ardent
desire
to
kiss
it
slowly
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
then
relinquished
it
as
her
delicate
fingers
lay
upon
her
knee
the
young
widow
said
gravely
yes
i
shall
be
all
alone
but
i
shall
force
myself
to
be
brave
he
did
not
know
how
to
tell
her
that
he
would
be
delighted
to
wed
her
certainly
it
was
no
time
to
speak
to
her
on
such
a
subject
however
he
thought
he
might
be
able
to
express
himself
by
means
of
some
phrase
which
would
have
a
hidden
meaning
and
would
infer
what
he
wished
to
say
but
that
rigid
corpse
lay
between
them
the
atmosphere
became
oppressive
almost
suffocating
duroy
asked
can
we
not
open
the
window
a
little
the
air
seems
to
be
impure
certainly
she
replied
i
have
noticed
it
too
he
opened
the
window
letting
in
the
cool
night
air
he
turned
come
and
look
out
it
is
delightful
she
glided
softly
to
his
side
he
whispered
listen
to
me
do
not
be
angry
that
i
broach
the
subject
at
such
a
time
but
the
day
after
i
shall
leave
here
and
when
you
return
to
paris
it
might
be
too
late
you
know
that
i
am
only
a
poor
devil
who
has
his
position
to
make
but
i
have
the
will
and
some
intelligence
and
i
am
advancing
a
man
who
has
attained
his
ambition
knows
what
to
count
on
a
man
who
has
his
way
to
make
does
not
know
what
may
come
it
may
be
better
or
worse
i
told
you
one
day
that
my
most
cherished
dream
was
to
have
a
wife
like
you
i
repeat
it
to
you
do
not
reply
but
let
me
continue
this
is
no
proposal
the
time
and
place
would
render
it
odious
i
only
wish
to
tell
you
that
by
a
word
you
can
make
me
happy
and
that
you
can
make
of
me
as
you
will
either
a
friend
or
a
husband
for
my
heart
and
my
body
are
yours
i
do
not
want
you
to
answer
me
now
i
do
not
wish
to
speak
any
more
on
the
subject
here
when
we
meet
in
paris
you
can
tell
me
your
decision
he
uttered
these
words
without
glancing
at
her
and
she
seemed
not
to
have
heard
them
for
she
stood
by
his
side
motionless
staring
vaguely
and
fixedly
at
the
landscape
before
her
bathed
in
moonlight
at
length
she
murmured
it
is
rather
chilly
and
turned
toward
the
bed
duroy
followed
her
they
did
not
speak
but
continued
their
watch
toward
midnight
georges
fell
asleep
at
daybreak
the
nurse
entered
and
he
started
up
both
he
and
mme
forestier
retired
to
their
rooms
to
obtain
some
rest
at
eleven
they
rose
and
lunched
together
while
through
the
open
window
was
wafted
the
sweet
perfumed
air
of
spring
after
lunch
mme
forestier
proposed
that
they
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
as
they
walked
slowly
along
she
suddenly
said
without
turning
her
head
toward
him
in
a
low
grave
voice
listen
to
me
my
dear
friend
i
have
already
reflected
upon
what
you
proposed
to
me
and
i
can
not
allow
you
to
depart
without
a
word
of
reply
i
will
however
say
neither
yes
nor
no
we
will
wait
we
will
see
we
will
become
better
acquainted
you
must
think
it
well
over
too
do
not
yield
to
an
impulse
i
mention
this
to
you
before
even
poor
charles
is
buried
because
it
is
necessary
after
what
you
have
said
to
me
that
you
should
know
me
as
i
am
in
order
not
to
cherish
the
hope
you
expressed
to
me
any
longer
if
you
are
not
a
man
who
can
understand
and
bear
with
me
now
listen
carefully
marriage
to
me
is
not
a
chain
but
an
association
i
must
be
free
entirely
unfettered
in
all
my
actions
my
coming
and
my
going
i
can
tolerate
neither
control
jealousy
nor
criticism
as
to
my
conduct
i
pledge
my
word
however
never
to
compromise
the
name
of
the
man
i
marry
nor
to
render
him
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
but
that
man
must
promise
to
look
upon
me
as
an
equal
an
ally
and
not
as
an
inferior
or
as
an
obedient
submissive
wife
my
ideas
i
know
are
not
like
those
of
other
people
but
i
shall
never
change
them
do
not
answer
me
it
would
be
useless
we
shall
meet
again
and
talk
it
all
over
later
now
take
a
walk
i
shall
return
to
him
until
he
kissed
her
hand
and
left
her
without
having
uttered
a
word
that
night
they
met
at
dinner
directly
after
the
meal
they
sought
their
rooms
worn
out
with
fatigue
charles
forestier
was
buried
the
next
day
in
the
cemetery
at
cannes
without
any
pomp
and
georges
returned
to
paris
by
the
express
which
left
at
mme
forestier
accompanied
him
to
the
station
they
walked
up
and
down
the
platform
awaiting
the
hour
of
departure
and
conversing
on
indifferent
subjects
the
train
arrived
the
journalist
took
his
seat
a
porter
cried
marseilles
lyons
paris
all
aboard
the
locomotive
whistled
and
the
train
moved
slowly
out
of
the
station
the
young
man
leaned
out
of
the
carriage
and
looked
at
the
youthful
widow
standing
on
the
platform
gazing
after
him
just
as
she
was
disappearing
from
his
sight
he
threw
her
a
kiss
which
she
returned
with
a
more
discreet
wave
of
her
hand

georges
duroy
resumed
his
old
habits
installed
in
the
cozy
apartments
on
rue
de
constantinople
his
relations
with
mme
de
marelle
became
quite
conjugal
mme
forestier
had
not
returned
she
lingered
at
cannes
he
however
received
a
letter
from
her
announcing
her
return
about
the
middle
of
april
but
containing
not
a
word
as
to
their
parting
he
waited
he
was
resolved
to
employ
every
means
to
marry
her
if
she
seemed
to
hesitate
he
had
faith
in
his
good
fortune
in
that
power
of
attraction
which
he
felt
within
him
a
power
so
irresistible
that
all
women
yielded
to
it
at
length
a
short
note
admonished
him
that
the
decisive
moment
had
arrived
i
am
in
paris
come
to
see
me
madeleine
forestier
nothing
more
he
received
it
at
nine
at
three
of
the
same
day
he
called
at
her
house
she
extended
both
hands
to
him
with
a
sweet
smile
and
they
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
for
several
seconds
then
she
murmured
how
kind
of
you
to
come
he
replied
i
should
have
come
whensoever
you
bade
me
they
sat
down
she
inquired
about
the
walters
his
associates
and
the
newspaper
i
miss
that
very
much
said
she
i
had
become
a
journalist
in
spirit
i
like
the
profession
she
paused
he
fancied
he
saw
in
her
smile
in
her
voice
in
her
words
a
kind
of
invitation
and
although
he
had
resolved
not
to
hasten
matters
he
stammered
well
why
why
do
you
not
resume
that
profession
under
the
name
of
duroy
she
became
suddenly
serious
and
placing
her
hand
on
his
arm
she
said
do
not
let
us
speak
of
that
yet
divining
that
she
would
accept
him
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
passionately
kissed
her
hands
saying
thank
you
thank
you
how
i
love
you
she
rose
she
was
very
pale
duroy
kissed
her
brow
when
she
had
disengaged
herself
from
his
embrace
she
said
gravely
listen
my
friend
i
have
not
yet
fully
decided
but
my
answer
may
be
you
must
wait
patiently
however
until
i
disclose
the
secret
to
you
he
promised
and
left
her
his
heart
overflowing
with
joy
he
worked
steadily
spent
little
tried
to
save
some
money
that
he
might
not
be
without
a
sou
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
became
as
miserly
as
he
had
once
been
prodigal
summer
glided
by
then
autumn
and
no
one
suspected
the
tie
existing
between
duroy
and
mme
forestier
for
they
seldom
met
in
public
one
evening
madeleine
said
to
him
you
have
not
yet
told
mme
de
marelle
our
plans
no
my
dear
as
you
wished
them
kept
secret
i
have
not
mentioned
them
to
a
soul
very
well
there
is
plenty
of
time
i
will
tell
the
walters
she
turned
away
her
head
and
continued
if
you
wish
we
can
be
married
the
beginning
of
may
i
obey
you
in
all
things
joyfully
the
tenth
of
may
which
falls
on
saturday
would
please
me
for
it
is
my
birthday
very
well
the
tenth
of
may
your
parents
live
near
rouen
do
they
not
yes
near
rouen
at
canteleu
i
am
very
anxious
to
see
them
he
hesitated
perplexed
but
they
are
then
he
added
more
firmly
my
dear
they
are
plain
country
people
innkeepers
who
strained
every
nerve
to
give
me
an
education
i
am
not
ashamed
of
them
but
their
simplicity
their
rusticity
might
annoy
you
she
smiled
sweetly
no
i
will
love
them
very
much
we
will
visit
them
i
wish
to
i
too
am
the
child
of
humble
parents
but
i
lost
mine
i
have
no
one
in
the
world
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
but
you
he
was
affected
conquered
as
he
had
never
been
by
any
woman
i
have
been
thinking
of
something
said
she
but
it
is
difficult
to
explain
he
asked
what
is
it
it
is
this
i
am
like
all
women
i
have
my
my
weaknesses
i
should
like
to
bear
a
noble
name
can
you
not
on
the
occasion
of
our
marriage
change
your
name
somewhat
she
blushed
as
if
she
had
proposed
something
indelicate
he
replied
simply
i
have
often
thought
of
it
but
it
does
not
seem
easy
to
me
why
not
he
laughed
because
i
am
afraid
i
should
be
ridiculed
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
not
at
all
not
at
all
everyone
does
it
and
no
one
laughs
separate
your
name
in
this
way
du
roy
it
sounds
very
well
he
replied
no
that
will
not
do
it
is
too
common
a
proceeding
i
have
thought
of
assuming
the
name
of
my
native
place
first
as
a
literary
pseudonym
and
then
as
my
surname
in
conjunction
with
duroy
which
might
later
on
as
you
proposed
be
separated
she
asked
is
your
native
place
canteleu
yes
i
do
not
like
the
termination
could
we
not
modify
it
she
took
a
pen
and
wrote
down
the
names
in
order
to
study
them
suddenly
she
cried
now
i
have
it
and
held
toward
him
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
was
written
mme
duroy
de
cantel
gravely
he
replied
yes
it
is
very
nice
she
was
delighted
and
repeated
duroy
de
cantel
mme
duroy
de
cantel
it
is
excellent
excellent
then
she
added
with
an
air
of
conviction
you
will
see
how
easily
it
will
be
accepted
by
everyone
after
sign
your
articles
de
cantel
and
your
simply
that
is
done
on
the
press
every
day
and
no
one
will
be
surprised
to
see
you
take
a
nom
de
plume
what
is
your
father
name
alexandre
she
murmured
alexandre
two
or
three
times
in
succession
then
she
wrote
upon
a
blank
sheet
and
mme
alexandre
du
roy
de
cantel
announce
the
marriage
of
their
son
georges
du
roy
de
cantel
with
mme
forestier
she
examined
her
writing
and
charmed
with
the
effect
exclaimed
with
a
little
method
one
can
succeed
in
anything
when
georges
reached
the
street
resolved
to
call
himself
henceforth
du
roy
or
even
du
roy
de
cantel
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
of
more
importance
he
swaggered
more
boldly
held
his
head
more
erect
and
walked
as
he
thought
gentlemen
should
he
felt
a
desire
to
inform
the
my
name
is
du
roy
de
cantel
scarcely
had
he
entered
his
apartments
when
the
thought
of
mme
de
marelle
rendered
him
uneasy
and
he
wrote
to
her
immediately
appointing
a
meeting
for
the
following
day
it
will
be
hard
thought
he
there
will
be
a
quarrel
surely
the
next
morning
he
received
a
telegram
from
madame
informing
him
that
she
would
be
with
him
at
one
he
awaited
her
impatiently
determined
to
confess
at
once
and
afterward
to
argue
with
her
to
tell
her
that
he
could
not
remain
a
bachelor
indefinitely
and
that
as
de
marelle
persisted
in
living
he
had
been
compelled
to
choose
some
one
else
as
a
legal
companion
when
the
bell
rang
his
heart
gave
a
bound
mme
de
marelle
entered
and
cast
herself
into
his
arms
saying
good
afternoon
perceiving
that
his
embrace
was
colder
than
usual
she
glanced
up
at
him
and
asked
what
ails
you
take
a
seat
said
he
we
must
talk
seriously
she
seated
herself
without
removing
her
hat
and
waited
he
cast
down
his
eyes
he
was
preparing
to
commence
finally
he
said
slowly
my
dear
friend
you
see
that
i
am
very
much
perplexed
very
sad
and
very
much
embarrassed
by
what
i
have
to
confess
to
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
the
fear
of
giving
you
pain
grieves
me
more
than
what
i
have
to
tell
you
she
turned
pale
trembled
and
asked
what
is
it
tell
me
quickly
he
said
sadly
but
resolutely
i
am
going
to
be
married
she
sighed
like
one
about
to
lose
consciousness
then
she
gasped
but
did
not
speak
he
continued
you
can
not
imagine
how
much
i
suffered
before
taking
that
resolution
but
i
have
neither
position
nor
money
i
am
alone
in
paris
i
must
have
near
me
some
one
who
can
counsel
comfort
and
support
me
what
i
need
is
an
associate
an
ally
and
i
have
found
one
he
paused
hoping
that
she
would
reply
expecting
an
outburst
of
furious
rage
reproaches
and
insults
she
pressed
her
hand
to
her
heart
and
breathed
with
difficulty
he
took
the
hand
resting
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
but
she
drew
it
away
and
murmured
as
if
stupefied
oh
my
god
he
fell
upon
his
knees
before
her
without
however
venturing
to
touch
her
more
moved
by
her
silence
than
he
would
have
been
by
her
anger
clo
my
little
clo
you
understand
my
position
oh
if
i
could
have
married
you
what
happiness
it
would
have
afforded
me
but
you
were
married
what
could
i
do
just
think
of
it
i
must
make
my
way
in
the
world
and
i
can
never
do
so
as
long
as
i
have
no
domestic
ties
if
you
knew
there
are
days
when
i
should
like
to
kill
your
husband
he
spoke
in
a
low
seductive
voice
he
saw
two
tears
gather
in
mme
de
eyes
and
trickle
slowly
down
her
cheeks
he
whispered
do
not
weep
clo
do
not
weep
i
beseech
you
you
break
my
heart
she
made
an
effort
to
appear
dignified
and
haughty
and
asked
though
somewhat
unsteadily
who
is
it
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
before
he
replied
madeleine
forestier
mme
de
marelle
started
her
tears
continued
to
flow
she
rose
duroy
saw
that
she
was
going
to
leave
him
without
a
word
of
reproach
or
pardon
and
he
felt
humbled
humiliated
he
seized
her
gown
and
implored
do
not
leave
me
thus
she
looked
at
him
with
that
despairing
tearful
glance
so
charming
and
so
touching
which
expresses
all
the
misery
in
a
woman
heart
and
stammered
i
have
nothing
to
say
i
can
do
nothing
you
you
are
right
you
have
made
a
good
choice
and
disengaging
herself
she
left
the
room
with
a
sigh
of
relief
at
escaping
so
easily
he
repaired
to
mme
forestier
who
asked
him
have
you
told
mme
de
marelle
he
replied
calmly
yes
did
it
affect
her
not
at
all
on
the
contrary
she
thought
it
an
excellent
plan
the
news
was
soon
noised
abroad
some
were
surprised
others
pretended
to
have
foreseen
it
and
others
again
smiled
inferring
that
they
were
not
at
all
astonished
the
young
man
who
signed
his
articles
de
cantel
his
echoes
duroy
and
his
political
sketches
du
roy
spent
the
best
part
of
his
time
with
his
betrothed
who
had
decided
that
the
date
fixed
for
the
wedding
should
be
kept
secret
that
the
ceremony
should
be
celebrated
in
the
presence
of
witnesses
only
that
they
should
leave
the
same
evening
for
rouen
and
that
the
day
following
they
should
visit
the
journalist
aged
parents
and
spend
several
days
with
them
duroy
had
tried
to
persuade
madeleine
to
abandon
that
project
but
not
succeeding
in
his
efforts
he
was
finally
compelled
to
submit
the
tenth
of
may
arrived
thinking
a
religious
ceremony
unnecessary
as
they
had
issued
no
invitations
the
couple
were
married
at
a
magistrate
and
took
the
six
train
for
normandy
as
the
train
glided
along
duroy
seated
in
front
of
his
wife
took
her
hand
kissed
it
and
said
when
we
return
we
will
dine
at
chatou
sometimes
she
murmured
we
shall
have
a
great
many
things
to
do
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
say
we
must
sacrifice
pleasure
to
duty
he
retained
her
hand
wondering
anxiously
how
he
could
manage
to
caress
her
he
pressed
her
hand
slightly
but
she
did
not
respond
to
the
pressure
he
said
it
seems
strange
that
you
should
be
my
wife
she
appeared
surprised
why
i
do
not
know
it
seems
droll
i
want
to
embrace
you
and
i
am
surprised
that
i
have
the
right
she
calmly
offered
him
her
cheek
which
he
kissed
as
he
would
have
kissed
his
sister
he
continued
the
first
time
i
saw
you
you
remember
at
that
dinner
to
which
i
was
invited
at
forestier
i
thought
if
i
could
only
find
a
wife
like
that
and
now
i
have
one
she
glanced
at
him
with
smiling
eyes
he
said
to
himself
i
am
too
cold
i
am
stupid
i
should
make
more
advances
and
he
asked
how
did
you
make
forestier
acquaintance
she
replied
with
provoking
archness
are
we
going
to
rouen
to
talk
of
him
he
colored
i
am
a
fool
you
intimidate
me
she
was
delighted
i
impossible
he
seated
himself
beside
her
she
exclaimed
ah
a
stag
the
train
was
passing
through
the
forest
of
and
she
had
seen
a
frightened
deer
clear
an
alley
at
a
bound
as
she
gazed
out
of
the
open
window
duroy
bending
over
her
pressed
a
kiss
upon
her
neck
for
several
moments
she
remained
motionless
then
raising
her
head
she
said
you
tickle
me
stop
but
he
did
not
obey
her
she
repeated
stop
i
say
he
seized
her
head
with
his
right
hand
turned
it
toward
him
and
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
she
struggled
pushed
him
away
and
repeated
stop
he
did
not
heed
her
with
an
effort
she
freed
herself
and
rising
said
georges
have
done
we
are
not
children
we
shall
soon
reach
rouen
very
well
said
he
gaily
i
will
wait
reseating
herself
near
him
she
talked
of
what
they
would
do
on
their
return
they
would
keep
the
apartments
in
which
she
had
lived
with
her
first
husband
and
duroy
would
receive
forestier
position
on
la
vie
francaise
in
the
meantime
forgetting
her
injunctions
and
his
promise
he
slipped
his
arm
around
her
waist
pressed
her
to
him
and
murmured
i
love
you
dearly
my
little
made
the
gentleness
of
his
tone
moved
the
young
woman
and
leaning
toward
him
she
offered
him
her
lips
as
she
did
so
a
whistle
announced
the
proximity
of
the
station
pushing
back
some
stray
locks
upon
her
temples
she
exclaimed
we
are
foolish
he
kissed
her
hands
feverishly
and
replied
i
adore
you
my
little
made
on
reaching
rouen
they
repaired
to
a
hotel
where
they
spent
the
night
the
following
morning
when
they
had
drunk
the
tea
placed
upon
the
table
in
their
room
duroy
clasped
his
wife
in
his
arms
and
said
my
little
made
i
feel
that
i
love
you
very
very
much
she
smiled
trustfully
and
murmured
as
she
returned
his
kisses
i
love
you
too
a
little
the
visit
to
his
parents
worried
georges
although
he
had
prepared
his
wife
he
began
again
you
know
they
are
peasants
real
not
sham
peasants
she
smiled
i
know
it
you
have
told
me
often
enough
we
shall
be
very
uncomfortable
there
is
only
a
straw
bed
in
my
room
they
do
not
know
what
hair
mattresses
are
at
canteleu
she
seemed
delighted
so
much
the
better
it
would
be
charming
to
sleep
badly
when
near
you
and
to
be
awakened
by
the
crowing
of
the
cocks
he
walked
toward
the
window
and
lighted
a
cigarette
the
sight
of
the
harbor
of
the
river
filled
with
ships
moved
him
and
he
exclaimed
egad
but
that
is
fine
madeleine
joined
him
and
placing
both
of
her
hands
on
her
shoulder
cried
oh
how
beautiful
i
did
not
know
that
there
were
so
many
ships
an
hour
later
they
departed
in
order
to
breakfast
with
the
old
couple
who
had
been
informed
several
days
before
of
their
intended
arrival
both
duroy
and
his
wife
were
charmed
with
the
beauties
of
the
landscape
presented
to
their
view
and
the
cabman
halted
in
order
to
allow
them
to
get
a
better
idea
of
the
panorama
before
them
as
he
whipped
up
his
horse
duroy
saw
an
old
couple
not
a
hundred
meters
off
approaching
and
he
leaped
from
the
carriage
crying
here
they
are
i
know
them
the
man
was
short
corpulent
florid
and
vigorous
notwithstanding
his
age
the
woman
was
tall
thin
and
melancholy
with
stooping
shoulders
a
woman
who
had
worked
from
childhood
who
had
never
laughed
nor
jested
madeleine
too
alighted
and
watched
the
couple
advance
with
a
contraction
of
her
heart
she
had
not
anticipated
they
did
not
recognize
their
son
in
that
fine
gentleman
and
they
would
never
have
taken
that
handsome
lady
for
their
they
walked
along
passed
the
child
they
were
expecting
without
glancing
at
the
city
folks
georges
cried
with
a
laugh
good
day
father
duroy
both
the
old
man
and
his
wife
were
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
the
latter
recovered
her
first
and
asked
is
it
you
son
the
young
man
replied
yes
it
is
i
mother
duroy
and
approaching
her
he
kissed
her
upon
both
cheeks
and
said
this
is
my
wife
the
two
rustics
stared
at
madeleine
as
if
she
were
a
curiosity
with
anxious
fear
combined
with
a
sort
of
satisfied
approbation
on
the
part
of
the
father
and
of
jealous
enmity
on
that
of
the
mother
duroy
senior
who
was
naturally
jocose
made
so
bold
as
to
ask
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
may
i
kiss
you
too
his
son
uttered
an
exclamation
and
madeleine
offered
her
cheek
to
the
old
peasant
who
afterward
wiped
his
lips
with
the
back
of
his
hand
the
old
woman
in
her
turn
kissed
her
with
hostile
reserve
her
ideal
was
a
stout
rosy
country
lass
as
red
as
an
apple
and
as
round
the
carriage
preceded
them
with
the
luggage
the
old
man
took
his
arm
and
asked
him
how
are
you
getting
on
very
well
that
is
right
tell
me
has
your
wife
any
means
georges
replied
forty
thousand
francs
his
father
whistled
softly
and
muttered
whew
then
he
added
she
is
a
handsome
woman
he
admired
his
son
wife
and
in
his
day
had
considered
himself
a
connoisseur
madeleine
and
the
mother
walked
side
by
side
in
silence
the
two
men
joined
them
they
soon
reached
the
village
at
the
entrance
to
which
stood
duroy
tavern
a
pine
board
fastened
over
the
door
indicated
that
thirsty
people
might
enter
the
table
was
laid
a
neighbor
who
had
come
to
assist
made
a
low
courtesy
on
seeing
so
beautiful
a
lady
appear
then
recognizing
georges
she
cried
oh
lord
is
it
you
he
replied
merrily
yes
it
is
i
mother
brulin
and
he
kissed
her
as
he
had
kissed
his
father
and
mother
then
he
turned
to
his
wife
come
into
our
room
said
he
you
can
lay
aside
your
hat
they
passed
through
a
door
to
the
right
and
entered
a
room
paved
with
brick
with
whitewashed
walls
and
a
bed
with
cotton
hangings
a
crucifix
above
a
basin
and
two
colored
prints
representing
paul
and
virginia
beneath
a
blue
and
napoleon
on
a
yellow
horse
were
the
only
ornaments
in
that
neat
but
bare
room
when
they
were
alone
georges
embraced
madeleine
good
morning
made
i
am
glad
to
see
the
old
people
once
more
when
one
is
in
paris
one
does
not
think
of
this
place
but
when
one
returns
one
enjoys
it
just
the
same
at
that
moment
his
father
cried
knocking
on
the
partition
with
his
fist
come
the
soup
is
ready
they
the
large
and
took
their
seats
at
the
table
the
meal
was
a
long
one
served
in
a
truly
rustic
fashion
father
duroy
enlivened
by
the
cider
and
several
glasses
of
wine
related
many
anecdotes
while
georges
to
whom
they
were
all
familiar
laughed
at
them
mother
duroy
did
not
speak
but
sat
at
the
board
grim
and
austere
glancing
at
her
with
hatred
in
her
heart
madeleine
did
not
speak
nor
did
she
eat
she
was
depressed
wherefore
she
had
wished
to
come
she
knew
that
she
was
coming
to
a
simple
home
she
had
formed
no
poetical
ideas
of
those
peasants
but
she
had
perhaps
expected
to
find
them
somewhat
more
polished
refined
she
recalled
her
own
mother
of
whom
she
never
spoke
to
anyone
a
governess
who
had
been
betrayed
and
who
had
died
of
grief
and
shame
when
madeleine
was
twelve
years
old
a
stranger
had
had
the
little
girl
educated
her
father
without
doubt
who
was
he
she
did
not
know
positively
but
she
had
vague
suspicions
the
meal
was
not
yet
over
when
customers
entered
shook
hands
with
duroy
exclaimed
on
seeing
his
son
and
seating
themselves
at
the
wooden
tables
began
to
drink
smoke
and
play
dominoes
the
smoke
from
the
clay
pipes
and
penny
cigars
filled
the
room
madeleine
choked
and
asked
can
we
go
out
i
can
not
remain
here
any
longer
old
duroy
grumbled
at
being
disturbed
madeleine
rose
and
placed
her
chair
at
the
door
in
order
to
wait
until
her
and
his
wife
had
finished
their
coffee
and
wine
georges
soon
joined
her
would
you
like
to
stroll
down
to
the
seine
joyfully
she
cried
yes
they
descended
the
hillside
hired
a
boat
at
croisset
and
spent
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
beneath
the
willows
in
the
soft
warm
spring
air
and
rocked
gently
by
the
rippling
waves
of
the
river
they
returned
at
nightfall
the
evening
repast
by
was
more
painful
to
madeleine
than
that
of
the
morning
neither
father
duroy
nor
his
wife
spoke
when
the
meal
was
over
madeleine
drew
her
husband
outside
in
order
not
to
have
to
remain
in
that
room
the
atmosphere
of
which
was
heavy
with
smoke
and
the
fumes
of
liquor
when
they
were
alone
he
said
you
are
already
weary
she
attempted
to
protest
he
interrupted
her
i
have
seen
it
if
you
wish
we
will
leave
tomorrow
she
whispered
i
should
like
to
go
they
walked
along
and
entered
a
narrow
path
among
high
trees
hedged
in
on
either
side
by
impenetrable
brushwood
she
asked
where
are
we
he
replied
in
the
forest
one
of
the
largest
in
france
madeleine
on
raising
her
head
could
see
the
stars
between
the
branches
and
hear
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
she
felt
strangely
nervous
why
she
could
not
tell
she
seemed
to
be
lost
surrounded
by
perils
abandoned
alone
beneath
that
vast
vaulted
sky
she
murmured
i
am
afraid
i
should
like
to
return
very
well
we
will
on
their
return
they
found
the
old
people
in
bed
the
next
morning
madeleine
rose
early
and
was
ready
to
leave
at
daybreak
when
georges
told
his
parents
that
they
were
going
to
return
home
they
guessed
whose
wish
it
was
his
father
asked
simply
shall
i
see
you
soon
again
yes
in
the
very
well
his
mother
grumbled
i
hope
you
will
not
regret
what
you
have
done
georges
gave
them
two
hundred
francs
to
appease
them
and
the
cab
arriving
at
ten
the
couple
kissed
the
old
peasants
and
set
out
as
they
were
descending
the
side
of
the
hill
duroy
laughed
you
see
said
he
i
warned
you
i
should
however
not
have
presented
you
to
and
mme
du
roy
de
cantel
senior
she
laughed
too
and
replied
i
am
charmed
now
they
are
nice
people
whom
i
am
beginning
to
like
very
much
i
shall
send
them
confections
from
paris
then
she
murmured
du
roy
de
cantel
we
will
say
that
we
spent
a
week
at
your
parents
estate
and
drawing
near
him
she
kissed
him
saying
good
morning
georges
he
replied
good
morning
madeleine
as
he
slipped
his
arm
around
her
waist
chapter
jealousy
the
du
roys
had
been
in
paris
two
days
and
the
journalist
had
resumed
work
he
had
given
up
his
own
especial
province
to
assume
that
of
forestier
and
to
devote
himself
entirely
to
politics
on
this
particular
evening
he
turned
his
steps
toward
home
with
a
light
heart
as
he
passed
a
florist
on
rue
notre
dame
de
lorette
he
bought
a
bouquet
of
roses
for
madeleine
having
forgotten
his
key
on
arriving
at
his
door
he
rang
and
the
servant
answered
his
summons
georges
asked
is
madame
at
home
yes
sir
in
the
he
paused
in
astonishment
to
see
covers
laid
for
three
the
door
of
the
salon
being
ajar
he
saw
madeleine
arranging
in
a
vase
on
the
mantelpiece
a
bunch
of
roses
similar
to
his
he
entered
the
room
and
asked
have
you
invited
anyone
to
dinner
she
replied
without
turning
her
head
and
continuing
the
arrangement
of
her
flowers
yes
and
no
it
is
my
old
friend
count
de
vaudrec
who
is
in
the
habit
of
dining
here
every
monday
and
who
will
come
now
as
he
always
has
georges
murmured
very
well
he
stopped
behind
her
the
bouquet
in
his
hand
the
desire
strong
within
him
to
conceal
it
to
throw
it
away
however
he
said
here
i
have
brought
you
some
roses
she
turned
to
him
with
a
smile
and
said
ah
how
thoughtful
of
you
and
she
kissed
him
with
such
evident
affection
that
he
felt
consoled
she
took
the
flowers
inhaled
their
perfume
and
put
them
in
an
empty
vase
then
she
said
as
she
noted
the
effect
now
i
am
satisfied
my
mantelpiece
looks
pretty
adding
with
an
air
of
conviction
vaudrec
is
charming
you
will
become
intimate
with
him
at
once
a
ring
announced
the
count
he
entered
as
if
he
were
at
home
after
gallantly
kissing
mme
du
roy
hand
he
turned
to
her
husband
and
cordially
offered
his
hand
saying
how
are
you
my
dear
du
roy
he
had
no
longer
that
haughty
air
but
was
very
affable
one
would
have
thought
in
the
course
of
five
minutes
that
the
two
men
had
known
one
another
for
ten
years
madeleine
whose
face
was
radiant
said
i
will
leave
you
together
i
have
work
to
superintend
in
the
kitchen
the
dinner
was
excellent
and
the
count
remained
very
late
when
he
was
gone
madeleine
said
to
her
husband
is
he
not
nice
he
improves
too
on
acquaintance
he
is
a
good
true
faithful
friend
ah
without
him
she
did
not
complete
her
sentence
and
georges
replied
yes
he
is
very
pleasant
i
think
we
shall
understand
each
other
well
you
do
not
know
she
said
that
we
have
work
to
do
before
retiring
i
did
not
have
time
to
tell
you
before
dinner
for
vaudrec
came
brought
me
important
news
of
morocco
we
must
make
a
fine
article
of
that
let
us
set
to
work
at
once
come
take
the
lamp
he
carried
the
lamp
and
they
entered
the
study
madeleine
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
and
having
lighted
a
cigarette
told
him
the
news
and
gave
him
her
plan
of
the
article
he
listened
attentively
making
notes
as
she
spoke
and
when
she
had
finished
he
raised
objections
took
up
the
question
and
in
his
turn
developed
another
plan
his
wife
ceased
smoking
for
her
interest
was
aroused
in
following
georges
line
of
thought
from
time
to
time
she
murmured
yes
yes
very
good
excellent
very
forcible
and
when
he
had
finished
speaking
she
said
now
let
us
write
it
was
always
difficult
for
him
to
make
a
beginning
and
she
would
lean
over
his
shoulder
and
whisper
the
phrases
in
his
ear
then
he
would
add
a
few
lines
when
their
article
was
completed
georges
it
both
he
and
madeleine
pronounced
it
admirable
and
kissed
one
another
with
passionate
admiration
the
article
appeared
with
the
signature
of
du
roy
de
cantel
and
made
a
great
sensation
walter
congratulated
the
author
who
soon
became
celebrated
in
political
circles
his
wife
too
surprised
him
by
the
ingenuousness
of
her
mind
the
cleverness
of
her
wit
and
the
number
of
her
acquaintances
at
almost
any
time
upon
returning
home
he
found
in
his
salon
a
senator
a
deputy
a
magistrate
or
a
general
who
treated
madeleine
with
grave
familiarity
deputy
who
dined
at
rue
fontaine
every
tuesday
was
one
of
the
largest
stockholders
of
walter
paper
and
the
colleague
and
associate
in
many
business
transactions
du
roy
hoped
later
on
that
some
of
the
benefits
promised
by
him
to
forestier
might
fall
to
his
share
they
would
be
given
to
madeleine
new
husband
that
was
all
nothing
was
changed
even
his
associates
sometimes
called
him
forestier
and
it
made
du
roy
furious
at
the
dead
he
grew
to
hate
the
very
name
it
was
to
him
almost
an
insult
even
at
home
the
obsession
continued
the
entire
house
reminded
him
of
charles
one
evening
du
roy
who
liked
sweetmeats
asked
why
do
we
never
have
sweets
his
wife
replied
pleasantly
i
never
think
of
it
because
charles
disliked
them
he
interrupted
her
with
an
impatient
gesture
do
you
know
i
am
getting
tired
of
charles
it
is
charles
here
charles
there
charles
liked
this
charles
liked
that
since
charles
is
dead
let
him
rest
in
peace
madeleine
ascribed
her
husband
burst
of
ill
humor
to
puerile
jealousy
but
she
was
flattered
and
did
not
reply
on
retiring
haunted
by
the
same
thought
he
asked
did
charles
wear
a
cotton
nightcap
to
keep
the
draft
out
of
his
ears
she
replied
pleasantly
no
a
lace
one
georges
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
scornfully
what
a
bird
from
that
time
georges
never
called
charles
anything
but
poor
charles
with
an
accent
of
infinite
pity
one
evening
as
du
roy
was
smoking
a
cigarette
at
his
window
toward
the
end
of
june
the
heat
awoke
in
him
a
desire
for
fresh
air
he
asked
my
little
made
would
you
like
to
go
as
far
as
the
bois
yes
certainly
they
took
an
open
carriage
and
drove
to
the
avenue
du
bois
de
boulogne
it
was
a
sultry
evening
a
host
of
cabs
lined
the
drive
one
behind
another
when
the
carriage
containing
georges
and
madeleine
reached
the
turning
which
led
to
the
fortifications
they
kissed
one
another
and
madeleine
stammered
in
confusion
we
are
as
childish
as
we
were
at
rouen
the
road
they
followed
was
not
so
much
frequented
a
gentle
breeze
rustled
the
leaves
of
the
trees
the
sky
was
studded
with
brilliant
stars
and
georges
murmured
as
he
pressed
his
wife
to
his
breast
oh
my
little
made
she
said
to
him
do
you
remember
how
gloomy
the
forest
at
canteleu
was
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
full
of
horrible
beasts
and
that
it
was
interminable
while
here
it
is
charming
one
can
feel
the
caressing
breezes
and
i
know
that
sevres
is
on
the
other
side
he
replied
in
our
forests
there
are
nothing
but
stags
foxes
roebucks
and
boars
with
here
and
there
a
forester
house
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
asked
did
you
come
here
in
the
evening
with
charles
occasionally
she
replied
frequently
he
felt
a
desire
to
return
home
at
once
forestier
image
haunted
him
however
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
the
carriage
rolled
on
toward
the
arc
de
triomphe
and
joined
the
stream
of
carriages
returning
home
as
georges
remained
silent
his
wife
who
divined
his
thoughts
asked
in
her
soft
voice
of
what
are
you
thinking
for
half
an
hour
you
have
not
uttered
a
word
he
replied
with
a
sneer
i
am
thinking
of
all
those
fools
who
kiss
one
another
and
i
believe
truly
that
there
is
something
else
to
be
done
in
life
she
whispered
yes
but
it
is
nice
sometimes
it
is
nice
when
one
has
nothing
better
to
do
georges
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
dead
he
said
to
himself
angrily
i
am
foolish
to
worry
to
torment
myself
as
i
have
done
after
remonstrating
thus
with
himself
he
felt
more
reconciled
to
the
thought
of
forestier
and
felt
like
exclaiming
good
evening
old
fellow
madeleine
who
was
bored
by
his
silence
asked
shall
we
go
to
tortoni
for
ices
before
returning
home
he
glanced
at
her
from
his
corner
and
thought
she
is
pretty
so
much
the
better
tit
for
tat
my
comrade
but
if
they
begin
again
to
annoy
me
with
you
it
will
get
somewhat
hot
at
the
north
pole
then
he
replied
certainly
my
darling
and
before
she
had
time
to
think
he
kissed
her
it
seemed
to
madeleine
that
her
husband
lips
were
icy
however
he
smiled
as
usual
and
gave
her
his
hand
to
assist
her
to
alight
at
the
cafe
chapter
xi
madame
walter
takes
a
hand
on
entering
the
office
the
following
day
du
roy
sought
boisrenard
and
told
him
to
warn
his
associates
not
to
continue
the
farce
of
calling
him
forestier
or
there
would
be
war
when
du
roy
returned
an
hour
later
no
one
called
him
by
that
name
from
the
office
he
proceeded
to
his
home
and
hearing
the
sound
of
ladies
voices
in
the
he
asked
the
servant
who
is
here
mme
walter
and
mme
de
marelle
was
the
reply
his
heart
pulsated
violently
as
he
opened
the
door
clotilde
was
seated
by
the
fireplace
it
seemed
to
georges
that
she
turned
pale
on
perceiving
him
having
greeted
mme
walter
and
her
two
daughters
seated
like
sentinels
beside
her
he
turned
to
his
former
mistress
she
extended
her
hand
he
took
and
pressed
it
as
if
to
say
i
love
you
still
she
returned
the
pressure
he
said
have
you
been
well
since
we
last
met
yes
have
you
and
turning
to
madeleine
she
added
will
you
permit
me
to
call
him
certainly
my
dear
i
will
permit
anything
you
wish
a
shade
of
irony
lurked
beneath
those
words
uttered
so
pleasantly
mme
walter
mentioned
a
to
be
given
at
jacques
apartments
the
proceeds
to
be
devoted
to
charities
and
in
which
many
society
ladies
were
going
to
assist
she
said
it
will
be
very
entertaining
but
i
am
in
despair
for
we
have
no
one
to
escort
us
my
husband
having
an
engagement
du
roy
offered
his
services
at
once
she
accepted
saying
my
daughters
and
i
shall
be
very
grateful
he
glanced
at
the
younger
of
the
two
girls
and
thought
little
suzanne
is
not
at
all
bad
not
at
all
she
resembled
a
doll
being
very
small
and
dainty
with
a
form
a
pretty
delicate
face
eyes
a
fair
skin
and
curly
flaxen
hair
her
elder
sister
rose
was
plain
one
of
those
girls
to
whom
no
attention
is
ever
paid
her
mother
rose
and
turning
to
georges
said
i
shall
count
on
you
next
thursday
at
two
he
replied
count
upon
me
madame
when
the
door
closed
upon
mme
walter
mme
de
marelle
in
her
turn
rose
au
revoir
this
time
she
pressed
his
hand
and
he
was
moved
by
that
silent
avowal
i
will
go
to
see
her
thought
he
left
alone
with
his
wife
she
laughed
and
looking
into
his
eyes
said
mme
walter
has
taken
a
fancy
to
you
he
replied
incredulously
nonsense
but
i
know
it
she
spoke
of
you
to
me
with
great
enthusiasm
she
said
she
would
like
to
find
two
husbands
like
you
for
her
daughters
fortunately
she
is
not
susceptible
herself
he
did
not
understand
her
and
repeated
susceptible
herself
she
replied
in
a
tone
of
conviction
oh
mme
walter
is
irreproachable
her
husband
you
know
as
well
as
i
but
she
is
different
still
she
has
suffered
a
great
deal
in
having
married
a
jew
though
she
has
been
true
to
him
she
is
a
virtuous
woman
du
roy
was
surprised
i
thought
her
a
jewess
she
a
jewess
no
indeed
she
is
the
prime
mover
in
all
the
charitable
movements
at
the
madeleine
she
was
even
married
by
a
priest
i
am
not
sure
but
that
walter
went
through
the
form
of
baptism
georges
murmured
and
she
likes
me
yes
if
you
were
not
married
i
should
advise
you
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
suzanne
would
you
not
prefer
her
to
rose
he
replied
as
he
twisted
his
mustache
eh
the
mother
is
not
so
bad
madeleine
replied
i
am
not
afraid
of
her
at
her
age
one
does
not
begin
to
make
conquests
one
should
commence
sooner
georges
thought
if
i
might
have
had
suzanne
ah
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
bah
it
is
absurd
her
father
would
not
have
consented
he
determined
to
treat
mme
walter
very
considerately
in
order
to
retain
her
regard
all
that
evening
he
was
haunted
by
recollections
of
his
love
for
clotilde
he
recalled
their
escapades
her
kindness
he
repeated
to
himself
she
is
indeed
nice
yes
i
shall
call
upon
her
when
he
had
lunched
the
following
morning
he
repaired
to
rue
verneuil
the
same
maid
opened
the
door
and
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
servant
she
asked
is
monsieur
well
he
replied
yes
my
child
and
entered
the
in
which
some
one
was
practising
scales
it
was
laurine
he
expected
she
would
fall
upon
his
neck
she
however
rose
ceremoniously
bowed
coldly
and
left
the
room
with
dignity
her
manner
was
so
much
like
that
of
an
outraged
woman
that
he
was
amazed
her
mother
entered
he
kissed
her
hand
how
much
i
have
thought
of
you
said
he
and
i
of
you
she
replied
they
seated
themselves
and
smiled
as
they
gazed
into
one
another
eyes
my
dear
little
clo
i
love
you
and
i
love
you
still
still
you
did
not
miss
me
yes
and
no
i
was
grieved
but
when
i
heard
your
reason
i
said
to
myself
he
will
return
to
me
some
day
i
dared
not
come
i
did
not
know
how
i
should
be
received
i
dared
not
but
i
longed
to
come
now
tell
me
what
ails
laurine
she
scarcely
bade
me
good
morning
and
left
the
room
with
an
angry
air
i
do
not
know
but
one
can
not
mention
you
to
her
since
your
marriage
i
really
believe
she
is
jealous
nonsense
yes
my
dear
she
no
longer
calls
you
but
forestier
instead
du
roy
colored
then
drawing
nearer
the
young
woman
he
said
kiss
me
she
obeyed
him
where
can
we
meet
again
he
asked
at
rue
de
constantinople
ah
are
the
apartments
not
rented
no
i
kept
them
you
did
yes
i
thought
you
would
return
his
heart
bounded
joyfully
she
loved
him
then
with
a
lasting
love
he
whispered
i
adore
you
then
he
asked
is
your
husband
well
yes
very
well
he
has
just
been
home
for
a
month
he
went
away
the
day
before
yesterday
du
roy
could
not
suppress
a
smile
how
opportunely
that
always
happens
she
replied
naively
yes
it
happens
opportunely
but
he
is
not
in
the
way
when
he
is
here
is
he
that
is
true
he
is
a
charming
man
how
do
you
like
your
new
life
tolerably
my
wife
is
a
comrade
an
associate
nothing
more
as
for
my
heart
i
understand
but
she
is
good
yes
she
does
not
trouble
me
he
drew
near
clotilde
and
murmured
when
shall
we
meet
again
if
you
will
yes
at
two
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
somewhat
embarrassed
you
know
i
intend
to
take
back
the
rooms
on
rue
de
constantinople
myself
i
wish
to
it
is
not
necessary
for
you
to
pay
for
them
she
kissed
his
hands
saying
you
may
do
as
you
like
i
am
satisfied
to
have
kept
them
until
we
met
again
and
du
roy
took
his
leave
very
well
satisfied
when
thursday
came
he
asked
madeleine

to
the
at
rival
no
i
do
not
care
about
it
i
will
go
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
georges
called
for
mme
walter
in
an
open
carriage
for
the
weather
was
delightful
he
was
surprised
to
find
her
looking
so
handsome
and
so
young
never
had
she
appeared
so
fresh
her
daughter
suzanne
was
dressed
in
pink
her
sister
looked
like
her
governess
at

a
long
line
of
carriages
du
roy
offered
his
arm
to
mme
walter
and
they
entered

for
the
benefit
of
the
orphans
of
the
sixth

under
the
patronage
of
all
the
wiles
of
the
senators
and
deputies
who
were
connected
with
la
vie
francaise
jacques
rival
received
the
arrivals
at
the
entrance
to
his
apartments
then
he
pointed
to
a
small
staircase
which
led
to
the
cellar
in
which
were
his
and
saying
downstairs
ladies
downstairs
the
match
will
take
place
in
the
subterranean
apartments
pressing
du
roy
hand
he
said
good
evening
du
roy
was
surprised
who
told
you
about
that
name
rival
replied
mme
walter
who
thinks
it
very
pretty
mme
walter
blushed
yes
i
confess
that
if
i
knew
you
better
i
should
do
as
little
laurine
and
i
should
call
you
too
it
suits
you
admirably
du
roy
laughed
i
beg
you
to
do
so
madame
she
cast
down
her
eyes
no
we
are
not
well
enough
acquainted
he
murmured
permit
me
to
hope
that
we
shall
become
so
well
we
shall
see
said
she
they
descended
the
stairs
and
entered
a
large
room
which
was
lighted
by
venetian
lanterns
and
decorated
with
festoons
of
gauze
nearly
all
the
benches
were
filled
with
ladies
who
were
chatting
as
if
they
were
at
a
theater
mme
walter
and
her
daughters
reached
their
seats
in
the
front
row
du
roy
having
obtained
their
places
for
them
whispered
i
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
you
men
can
not
occupy
the
seats
mme
walter
replied
hesitatingly
i
should
like
to
keep
you
just
the
same
you
could
tell
me
the
names
of
the
participants
see
if
you
stand
at
the
end
of
the
seat
you
will
not
annoy
anyone
she
raised
her
large
soft
eyes
to
his
and
insisted
come
stay
with
us
we
need
you
he
replied
i
obey
with
pleasure
madame
suddenly
jacques
rival
voice
announced
we
will
begin
ladies
then
followed
the
du
roy
retained
his
place
beside
the
ladies
and
gave
them
all
the
necessary
information
when
the
entertainment
was
over
and
all
expenses
were
paid
two
hundred
and
twenty
francs
remained
for
the
orphans
of
the
sixth
ward
du
roy
escorting
the
walters
awaited
his
carriage
when
seated
face
to
face
with
mme
walter
he
met
her
troubled
but
caressing
glance
egad
i
believe
she
is
affected
thought
he
and
he
smiled
as
he
recognized
the
fact
that
he
was
really
successful
with
the
female
sex
for
mme
de
marelle
since
the
renewal
of
their
relations
seemed
to
love
him
madly
with
a
light
heart
he
returned
home
madeleine
was
awaiting
him
in
the
i
have
some
news
said
she
the
affair
with
morocco
is
becoming
complicated
france
may
send
an
expedition
out
there
in
several
months
in
any
case
the
ministry
will
be
overthrown
and
laroche
will
profit
by
the
occasion
du
roy
in
order
to
draw
out
his
wife
pretended
not
to
believe
it
france
would
not
be
silly
enough
to
commence
any
folly
with
tunis
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
i
tell
you
she
will
you
do
not
understand
that
it
is
a
question
of
money
you
are
as
simple
as
forestier
her
object
was
to
wound
and
irritate
him
but
he
only
smiled
and
replied
what
as
simple
as
that
stupid
fellow
she
ceased
and
murmured
oh
georges
he
added
poor
devil
in
a
tone
of
profound
pity
madeleine
turned
her
back
upon
him
scornfully
after
a
moment
of
silence
she
continued
we
shall
have
some
company
tuesday
mme
is
coming
here
to
dine
with
viscountess
de
percemur
will
you
invite
rival
and
norbert
de
varenne
i
shall
go
to
mmes
walter
and
de
marelle
perhaps
too
we
may
have
mme
rissolin
du
roy
replied
very
well
i
will
see
to
rival
and
norbert
the
following
day
he
thought
he
would
anticipate
his
wife
visit
to
mme
walter
and
attempt
to
find
out
if
she
really
was
in
love
with
him
he
arrived
at
boulevard
malesherbes
at
two
he
was
ushered
into
the
salon
and
waited
finally
mme
walter
appeared
and
offered
him
her
hand
cordially
what
good
wind
blows
you
here
no
good
wind
but
a
desire
to
see
you
some
power
has
impelled
me
hither
i
do
not
know
why
i
have
nothing
to
say
except
that
i
have
come
here
i
am
pardon
the
morning
call
and
the
candor
of
my
explanation
he
uttered
those
words
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
and
a
serious
accent
in
his
voice
in
her
astonishment
she
stammered
with
a
blush
but
indeed
i
do
not
understand
you
surprise
me
he
added
it
is
a
declaration
made
in
jest
in
order
not
to
startle
you
they
were
seated
near
each
other
she
took
the
matter
as
a
jest
is
it
a
declaration
seriously
yes
for
a
long
time
i
have
wished
to
make
it
but
i
dared
not
they
say
you
are
so
austere
so
rigid
she
had
recovered
her
and
replied
why
did
you
choose
i
do
not
know
then
he
lowered
his
voice
or
rather
because
i
have
thought
only
of
you
since
yesterday
suddenly
turning
pale
she
gasped
come
enough
of
this
childishness
let
us
talk
of
something
else
but
he
fell
upon
his
knees
before
her
she
tried
to
rise
he
prevented
her
by
twining
his
arms
about
her
waist
and
repeated
in
a
passionate
voice
yes
it
is
true
that
i
have
loved
you
madly
for
some
time
do
not
answer
me
i
am
mad
i
love
you
oh
if
you
knew
how
i
love
you
she
could
utter
no
sound
in
her
agitation
she
repulsed
him
with
both
hands
for
she
could
feel
his
breath
upon
her
cheek
he
rose
suddenly
and
attempted
to
embrace
her
but
gaining
her
liberty
for
a
moment
she
escaped
him
and
ran
from
chair
to
chair
he
considering
such
pursuit
beneath
his
dignity
sank
into
a
chair
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
feigned
to
sob
convulsively
then
he
rose
cried
adieu
adieu
and
fled
in
the
hall
he
took
his
cane
calmly
and
left
the
house
saying
cristi
i
believe
she
loves
me
he
went
at
once
to
the
telegraph
office
to
send
a
message
to
clotilde
appointing
a
rendezvous
for
the
next
day
on
entering
the
house
at
his
usual
time
he
said
to
his
wife
well
is
everyone
coming
to
dinner
she
replied
yes
all
but
mme
walter
who
is
uncertain
as
to
whether
she
can
come
she
acted
very
strangely
never
mind
perhaps
she
can
manage
it
anyway
he
replied
she
will
come
he
was
not
however
certain
and
was
rendered
uneasy
until
the
day
of
the
dinner
that
morning
madeleine
received
a
message
from
mme
walter
to
this
effect
i
have
succeeded
in
arranging
matters
and
i
shall
be
with
you
but
my
husband
can
not
accompany
me
du
roy
thought
i
did
right
not
to
return
there
she
has
calmed
down
still
he
awaited
her
arrival
anxiously
she
appeared
very
composed
somewhat
reserved
and
haughty
he
was
very
humble
very
careful
and
submissive
mmes
and
rissolin
were
accompanied
by
their
husbands
mme
de
marelle
looked
bewitching
in
an
odd
combination
of
yellow
and
black
at
du
roy
right
sat
mme
walter
and
he
spoke
to
her
only
of
serious
matters
with
exaggerated
respect
from
time
to
time
he
glanced
at
clotilde
she
is
really
very
pretty
and
fresh
looking
thought
he
but
mme
walter
attracted
him
by
the
difficulty
of
the
conquest
she
took
her
leave
early
i
will
escort
you
said
he
she
declined
his
offer
he
insisted
why
do
you
not
want
me
you
wound
me
deeply
do
not
let
me
feel
that
i
am
not
forgiven
you
see
that
i
am
calm
she
replied
you
can
not
leave
your
guests
thus
he
smiled
bah
i
shall
be
absent
twenty
minutes
no
one
will
even
notice
it
if
you
refuse
me
you
will
break
my
heart
very
well
she
whispered
i
will
accept
when
they
were
seated
in
the
carriage
he
seized
her
hand
and
kissing
it
passionately
said
i
love
you
i
love
you
let
me
tell
it
to
you
i
will
not
touch
you
i
only
wish
to
repeat
that
i
love
you
she
stammered
after
what
you
promised
me
it
is
too
bad
too
bad
he
seemed
to
make
a
great
effort
then
he
continued
in
a
subdued
voice
see
how
i
can
control
myself
and
yet
let
me
only
tell
you
this
i
love
you
yes
let
me
go
home
with
you
and
kneel
before
you
five
minutes
to
utter
those
three
words
and
gaze
upon
your
beloved
face
she
suffered
him
to
take
her
hand
and
replied
in
broken
accents
no
i
can
not
i
do
not
wish
to
think
of
what
my
servants
my
daughters
would
say
no
no
it
is
impossible
he
continued
i
can
not
live
without
seeing
you
whether
it
be
at
your
house
or
elsewhere
i
must
see
you
for
only
a
moment
each
day
that
i
may
touch
your
hand
breathe
the
air
stirred
by
your
gown
contemplate
the
outlines
of
your
form
and
see
your
beautiful
eyes
she
listened
tremblingly
to
the
musical
language
of
love
and
made
answer
no
it
is
impossible
be
silent
he
spoke
very
low
he
whispered
in
her
ear
comprehending
that
it
was
necessary
to
win
that
simple
woman
gradually
to
persuade
her
to
appoint
a
meeting
where
she
willed
at
first
and
later
on
where
he
willed
listen
i
must
see
you
i
will
wait
at
your
door
like
a
beggar
if
you
do
not
come
down
i
will
come
to
you
but
i
shall
see
you
she
repeated
no
do
not
come
i
shall
not
receive
you
think
of
my
daughters
then
tell
me
where
i
can
meet
you
in
the
street
it
matters
not
where
at
any
hour
you
wish
provided
that
i
can
see
you
i
will
greet
you
i
will
say
i
love
you
and
then
go
away
she
hesitated
almost
distracted
as
the
coupe
stopped
at
the
door
she
whispered
hastily
i
will
be
at
la
trinite
at
half
past
three
after
alighting
she
said
to
her
coachman
take
du
roy
home
when
he
returned
his
wife
asked
where
have
you
been
he
replied
in
a
low
voice
i
have
been
to
send
an
important
telegram
mme
de
marelle
approached
him
you
must
take
me
home
you
know
that
i
only
dine
so
far
from
home
on
that
condition
turning
to
madeleine
she
asked
you
are
not
jealous
mme
du
roy
replied
slowly
no
not
at
all
the
guests
departed
clotilde
enveloped
in
laces
whispered
to
madeleine
at
the
door
your
dinner
was
perfect
in
a
short
while
you
will
have
the
best
political
salon
in
paris
when
she
was
alone
with
georges
she
said
oh
my
darling
i
love
you
more
dearly
every
day
the
cab
rolled
on
and
georges
thoughts
were
with
mme
walter
chapter
xii
a
meeting
and
the
result
the
july
sun
shone
upon
the
place
de
la
trinite
which
was
almost
deserted
du
roy
drew
out
his
watch
it
was
only
three
he
was
half
an
hour
too
early
he
laughed
as
he
thought
of
the
place
of
meeting
he
entered
the
sacred
edifice
of
la
trinite
the
coolness
within
was
refreshing
here
and
there
an
old
woman
kneeled
at
prayer
her
face
in
her
hands
du
roy
looked
at
his
watch
again
it
was
not
yet
a
quarter
past
three
he
took
a
seat
regretting
that
he
could
not
smoke
at
the
end
of
the
church
near
the
choir
he
could
hear
the
measured
tread
of
a
corpulent
man
whom
he
had
noticed
when
he
entered
suddenly
the
rustle
of
a
gown
made
him
start
it
was
she
he
arose
and
advanced
quickly
she
did
not
offer
him
her
hand
and
whispered
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
you
must
kneel
near
me
that
no
one
will
notice
us
she
proceeded
to
a
side
aisle
after
saluting
the
host
on
the
high
altar
took
a
footstool
and
kneeled
down
georges
took
one
beside
it
and
when
they
were
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
he
said
thank
you
thank
you
i
adore
you
i
should
like
to
tell
you
constantly
how
i
began
to
love
you
how
i
was
conquered
the
first
time
i
saw
you
will
you
permit
me
some
day
to
unburden
my
heart
to
explain
all
to
you
she
replied
between
her
fingers
i
am
mad
to
let
you
speak
to
me
thus
mad
to
have
come
hither
mad
to
do
as
i
have
done
to
let
you
believe
that
this
this
adventure
can
have
any
results
forget
it
and
never
speak
to
me
of
it
again
she
paused
he
replied
i
expect
nothing
i
hope
nothing
i
love
you
whatever
you
may
do
i
will
repeat
it
so
often
with
so
much
force
and
ardor
that
you
will
finally
understand
me
and
reply
love
you
too
he
felt
her
frame
tremble
as
she
involuntarily
repeated
i
love
you
too
he
was
overcome
by
astonishment
oh
my
god
she
continued
incoherently
should
i
say
that
to
you
i
feel
guilty
despicable
i
who
have
two
daughters
but
i
can
not
can
not
i
never
thought
it
was
stronger
than
i
listen
listen
i
have
never
loved
any
other
but
you
i
swear
it
i
have
loved
you
a
year
in
secret
i
have
suffered
and
struggled
i
can
no
longer
i
love
you
she
wept
and
her
bowed
form
was
shaken
by
the
violence
of
her
emotion
georges
murmured
give
me
your
hand
that
i
may
touch
may
press
it
she
slowly
took
her
hand
from
her
face
he
seized
it
saying
i
should
like
to
drink
your
tears
placing
the
hand
he
held
upon
his
heart
he
asked
do
you
feel
it
beat
in
a
few
moments
the
man
georges
had
noticed
before
passed
by
them
when
mme
walter
heard
him
near
her
she
snatched
her
fingers
from
georges
clasp
and
covered
her
face
with
them
after
the
man
had
disappeared
du
roy
asked
hoping
for
another
place
of
meeting
than
la
trinite
where
shall
i
see
you
she
did
not
reply
she
seemed
transformed
into
a
statue
of
prayer
he
continued
shall
i
meet
you
at
park
monceau
she
turned
a
livid
face
toward
him
and
said
unsteadily
leave
me
leave
me
now
go
go
away
for
only
five
minutes
i
suffer
too
much
near
you
i
want
to
pray
go
let
me
pray
alone
five
minutes
let
me
ask
god
to
pardon
me
to
save
me
leave
me
five
minutes
she
looked
so
pitiful
that
he
rose
without
a
word
and
asked
with
some
hesitation
shall
i
return
presently
she
nodded
her
head
in
the
affirmative
and
he
left
her
she
tried
to
pray
she
closed
her
eyes
in
order
not
to
see
georges
she
could
not
pray
she
could
only
think
of
him
she
would
rather
have
died
than
have
fallen
thus
she
had
never
been
weak
she
murmured
several
words
of
supplication
she
knew
that
all
was
over
that
the
struggle
was
in
vain
she
did
not
however
wish
to
yield
but
she
felt
her
weakness
some
one
approached
with
a
rapid
step
she
turned
her
head
it
was
a
priest
she
rose
ran
toward
him
and
clasping
her
hands
she
cried
save
me
save
me
he
stopped
in
surprise
what
do
you
want
madame
i
want
you
to
save
me
have
pity
on
me
if
you
do
not
help
me
i
am
lost
he
gazed
at
her
wondering
if
she
were
mad
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
priest
was
a
young
man
somewhat
inclined
to
corpulence
receive
my
confession
said
she
and
counsel
me
sustain
me
tell
me
what
to
do
he
replied
i
confess
every
saturday
from
three
to
six
seizing
his
arm
she
repeated
no
now
at
once
at
once
it
is
necessary
he
is
here
in
this
church
he
is
waiting
for
me
the
priest
asked
who
is
waiting
for
you
a
man
who
will
be
my
ruin
if
you
do
not
save
me
i
can
no
longer
escape
him
i
am
too
weak
too
weak
she
fell
upon
her
knees
sobbing
oh
father
have
pity
upon
me
save
me
for
god
sake
save
me
she
seized
his
gown
that
he
might
not
escape
her
while
he
uneasily
glanced
around
on
all
sides
to
see
if
anyone
noticed
the
woman
at
his
feet
finally
seeing
that
he
could
not
free
himself
from
her
he
said
rise
i
have
the
key
to
the
confessional
with
me
du
roy
having
walked
around
the
choir
was
sauntering
down
the
nave
when
he
met
the
stout
bold
man
wandering
about
and
he
wondered
what
can
he
be
doing
here
the
man
slackened
his
pace
and
looked
at
georges
with
the
evident
desire
to
speak
to
him
when
he
was
near
him
he
bowed
and
said
politely
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
for
disturbing
you
but
can
you
tell
me
when
this
church
was
built
du
roy
replied
i
do
not
know
i
think
it
is
twenty
or
years
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
here
i
have
never
seen
it
before
feeling
interested
in
the
stranger
the
journalist
continued
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
examining
into
it
very
carefully
the
man
replied
i
am
not
visiting
the
church
i
have
an
appointment
he
paused
and
in
a
few
moments
added
it
is
very
warm
outside
du
roy
looked
at
him
and
suddenly
thought
that
he
resembled
forestier
are
you
from
the
provinces
he
asked
yes
i
am
from
rennes
and
did
you
sir
enter
this
church
from
curiosity
no
i
am
waiting
for
a
lady
and
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
he
walked
away
he
did
not
find
mme
walter
in
the
place
in
which
he
had
left
her
and
was
surprised
she
had
gone
he
was
furious
then
he
thought
she
might
be
looking
for
him
and
he
walked
around
the
church
not
finding
her
he
returned
and
seated
himself
on
the
chair
she
had
occupied
hoping
that
she
would
rejoin
him
there
soon
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
voice
he
saw
no
one
whence
came
it
he
rose
to
examine
into
it
and
saw
in
a
chapel
near
by
the
doors
of
the
confessionals
he
drew
nearer
in
order
to
see
the
woman
whose
voice
he
heard
he
recognized
mme
walter
she
was
confessing
at
first
he
felt
a
desire
to
seize
her
by
the
arm
and
drag
her
away
then
he
seated
himself
near
by
and
bided
his
time
he
waited
quite
awhile
at
length
mme
walter
rose
turned
saw
him
and
came
toward
him
her
face
was
cold
and
severe
sir
said
she
i
beseech
you
not
to
accompany
me
not
to
follow
me
and
not
to
come
to
my
house
alone
you
will
not
be
admitted
adieu
and
she
walked
away
in
a
dignified
manner
he
permitted
her
to
go
because
it
was
against
his
principles
to
force
matters
as
the
priest
in
his
turn
issued
from
the
confessional
he
advanced
toward
him
and
said
if
you
did
not
wear
a
gown
i
would
give
you
a
sound
thrashing
then
he
turned
upon
his
heel
and
left
the
church
whistling
in
the
doorway
he
met
the
stout
gentleman
when
du
roy
passed
him
they
bowed
the
journalist
then
repaired
to
the
office
of
la
vie
francaise
as
he
entered
he
saw
by
the
clerks
busy
air
that
something
of
importance
was
going
on
and
he
hastened
to
the
manager
room
the
latter
exclaimed
joyfully
as
du
roy
entered
what
luck
here
is
he
stopped
in
confusion
and
apologized
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
very
much
bothered
by
circumstances
and
then
i
hear
my
wife
and
daughter
call
you
from
morning
until
night
and
i
have
acquired
the
habit
myself
are
you
displeased
georges
laughed
not
at
all
walter
continued
very
well
then
i
will
call

as
everyone
else
does
great
changes
have
taken
place
the
ministry

been
overthrown

of
foreign
affairs
we
shall

simple
declaration
of
principles
then
i
must
have
something
interesting
on
the
morocco
question
you
must
attend
to
that
du
roy
reflected
a
moment
and
then
replied
i
have
it
i
will
give
you
an
article
on
the
political
situation
of
our
african
colony
and
he
proceeded
to
prepare
walter
an
outline
of
his
work
which
was
nothing
but
a
modification
of
his
first
article
on
souvenirs
of
a
soldier
in
africa
the
manager
having
read
the
article
said
it
is
perfect
you
are
a
treasure
many
thanks
du
roy
returned
home
to
dinner
delighted
with
his
day
notwithstanding
his
failure
at
la
trinite
his
wife
was
awaiting
him
anxiously
she
exclaimed
on
seeing
him
you
know
that
laroche
is
minister
of
foreign
affairs
yes
i
have
just
written
an
article
on
that
subject
how
do
you
remember
the
first
article
we
wrote
on
of
a
soldier
in
africa
well
i
revised
and
corrected
it
for
the
occasion
she
smiled
ah
yes
that
will
do
very
well
at
that
moment
the
servant
entered
with
a
dispatch
containing
these
words
without
any
signature
i
was
beside
myself
pardon
me
and
come
at
four
to
park
monceau
he
understood
the
message
and
with
a
joyful
heart
slipped
the
telegram
into
his
pocket
during
dinner
he
repeated
the
words
to
himself
as
he
interpreted
them
they
meant
i
yield
i
am
yours
where
and
when
you
will
he
laughed
madeleine
asked
what
is
it
nothing
much
i
was
thinking
of
a
comical
old
priest
i
met
a
short
while
since
du
roy
arrived
at
the
appointed
hour
the
following
day
the
benches
were
all
occupied
by
people
trying
to
escape
from
the
heat
and
by
nurses
with
their
charges
he
found
mme
walter
in
a
little
antique
ruin
she
seemed
unhappy
and
anxious
when
he
had
greeted
her
she
said
how
many
people
there
are
in
the
garden
he
took
advantage
of
the
occasion
yes
that
is
true
shall
we
go
somewhere
else
where
it
matters
not
where
for
a
drive
for
instance

can
lower
the
shade
on
your
side
and
you
will
be
well
concealed
yes
i
should
like

better
i
shall
die
of
fear
here
very
well
meet
me
in
five
minutes
at
the
gate
which
opens
on
the
boulevard
i
will
fetch
a
cab
when
they
were
seated
in
the
cab
she
asked
where
did
you
tell
the
coachman
to
drive
to
georges
replied
do
not
worry
he
knows
he
had
given
the
man
his
address
on
the
rue
de
constantinople
mme
walter
said
to
du
roy
you
can
not
imagine
how
i
suffer
on
your
account
how
i
am
tormented
tortured
yesterday
i
was
harsh
but
i
wanted
to
escape
you
at
any
price
i
was
afraid
to
remain
alone
with
you
have
you
forgiven
me
he
pressed
her
hand
yes
yes
why
should
i
not
forgive
you
loving
you
as
i
do
she
looked
at
him
with
a
beseeching
air
listen
you
must
promise
to
respect
me
otherwise
i
could
never
see
you
again
at
first
he
did
not
reply
a
smile
lurked
beneath
his
mustache
then
he
murmured
i
am
your
slave
she
told
him
how
she
had
discovered
that
she
loved
him
on
learning
that
he
was
to
marry
madeleine
forestier
suddenly
she
ceased
speaking
the
carriage
stopped
du
roy
opened
the
door
where
are
we
she
asked
he
replied
alight
and
enter
the
house
we
shall
be
undisturbed
there
where
are
we
she
repeated
at
my
rooms
they
are
my
bachelor
apartments
which
i
have
rented
for
a
few
days
that
we
might
have
a
corner
in
which
to
meet
she
clung
to
the
cab
startled
at
the
thought
of
a
and
stammered
no
no
i
do
not
want
to
he
said
firmly
i
swear
to
respect
you
come
you
see
that
people
are
looking
at
us
that
a
crowd
is
gathering
around
us
make
haste
and
he
repeated
i
swear
to
respect
you
she
was
and
rushed
into
the
house
she
was
about
to
ascend
the
stairs
he
seized
her
arm
it
is
here
on
the
ground
floor
when
he
had
closed
the
door
he
showered
kisses
upon
her
neck
her
eyes
her
lips
in
spite
of
herself
she
submitted
to
his
caresses
and
even
returned
them
hiding
her
face
and
murmuring
in
broken
accents
i
swear
that
i
have
never
had
a
lover
while
he
thought
that
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me

madame
de
marelle
autumn
had
come
the
du
roys
had
spent
the
entire
summer
in
paris
leading
a
vigorous
campaign
in
la
vie
francaise
in
favor
of
the
new
cabinet
although
it
was
only
the
early
part
of
october
the
chamber
was
about
to
resume
its
sessions
for
affairs
in
morocco
were
becoming
menacing
the
celebrated
speech
made
by
count
de
lambert
sarrazin
had
furnished
du
roy
with
material
for
ten
articles
on
the
algerian
colony
la
vie
francaise
had
gained
considerable
prestige
by
its
connection
with
the
power
it
was
the
first
to
give
political
news
and
every
newspaper
in
paris
and
the
provinces
sought
information
from
it
it
was
quoted
feared
and
began
to
be
respected
it
was
no
longer
the
organ
of
a
group
of
political
intriguers
but
the
avowed
mouthpiece
of
the
cabinet
was
the
soul
of
the
journal
and
du
roy
his
walter
retired
discreetly
into
the
background
madeleine
salon
became
an
influential
center
in
which
several
members
of
the
cabinet
met
every
week
the
president
of
the
council
had
even
dined
there
twice
the
minister
of
foreign
affairs
was
quite
at
home
at
the
du
roys
he
came
at
any
hour
bringing
dispatches
or
information
which
he
dictated
either
to
the
husband
or
wife
as
if
they
were
his
secretaries
after
the
minister
had
departed
when
du
roy
was
alone
with
madeleine
he
uttered
threats
and
insinuations
against
the
parvenu
as
he
called
him
his
wife
simply
shrugged
her
shoulders
scornfully
repeating
become
a
minister
and
you
can
do
the
same
until
then
be
silent
his
reply
was
no
one
knows
of
what
i
am
capable
perhaps
they
will
find
out
some
day
she
answered
philosophically
he
who
lives
will
see
the
morning
of
the
reopening
of
the
chamber
du
roy
lunched
with
in
order
to
receive
instructions
from
him
before
the
session
for
a
political
article
the
following
day
in
la
vie
francaise
which
was
to
be
a
sort
of
official
declaration
of
the
plans
of
the
cabinet
after
listening
to
eloquence
for
some
time
with
jealousy
in
his
heart
du
roy
sauntered
slowly
toward
the
office
to
commence
his
work
for
he
had
nothing
to
do
until
four
at
which
hour
he
was
to
meet
mme
de
marelle
at
rue
de
constantinople
they
met
there
regularly
twice
a
week
mondays
and
wednesdays
on
entering
the
office
he
was
handed
a
sealed
dispatch
it
was
from
mme
walter
and
read
thus
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
see
you
it
is
important
expect
me
at
two
at
rue
de
constantinople
i
can
render
you
a
great
service
your
friend
until
death
virginie
he
exclaimed
heavens
what
a
bore
and
left
the
office
at
once
too
much
annoyed
to
work
for
six
weeks
he
had
ineffectually
tried
to
break
with
mme
walter
at
three
successive
meetings
she
had
been
a
prey
to
remorse
and
had
overwhelmed
her
lover
with
reproaches
angered
by
those
scenes
and
already
weary
of
the
dramatic
woman
he
had
simply
avoided
her
hoping
that
the
affair
would
end
in
that
way
but
she
persecuted
him
with
her
affection
summoned
him
at
all
times
by
telegrams
to
meet
her
at
street
corners
in
shops
or
public
gardens
she
was
very
different
from
what
he
had
fancied
she
would
be
trying
to
attract
him
by
actions
ridiculous
in
one
of
her
age
it
disgusted
him
to
hear
her
call
him
my
rat
my
dog
my
treasure
my
jewel
my
and
to
see
her
assume
a
kind
of
childish
modesty
when
he
approached
it
seemed
to
him
that
being
the
mother
of
a
family
a
woman
of
the
world
she
should
have
been
more
sedate
and
have
yielded
with
tears
if
she
chose
but
with
the
tears
of
a
dido
and
not
of
a
juliette
he
never
heard
her
call
him
little
one
or
baby
without
wishing
to
reply
old
woman
to
take
his
hat
with
an
oath
and
leave
the
room
at
first
they
had
often
met
at
rue
de
constantinople
but
du
roy
who
feared
an
encounter
with
mme
de
marelle
invented
a
thousand
and
one
pretexts
in
order
to
avoid
that
rendezvous
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
either
lunch
or
dine
at
her
house
daily
when
she
would
clasp
his
hand
under
cover
of
the
table
or
offer
him
her
lips
behind
the
doors
above
all
georges
enjoyed
being
thrown
so
much
in
contact
with
suzanne
she
made
sport
of
everything
and
everybody
with
cutting
appropriateness
at
length
however
he
began
to
feel
an
unconquerable
repugnance
to
the
love
lavished
upon
him
by
the
mother
he
could
no
longer
see
her
hear
her
nor
think
of
her
without
anger
he
ceased
calling
upon
her
replying
to
her
letters
and
yielding
to
her
appeals
she
finally
divined
that
he
no
longer
loved
her
and
the
discovery
caused
her
unutterable
anguish
but
she
watched
him
followed
him
in
a
cab
with
drawn
blinds
to
the
office
to
his
house
in
the
hope
of
seeing
him
pass
by
he
would
have
liked
to
strangle
her
but
he
controlled
himself
on
account
of
his
position
on
la
vie
francaise
and
he
endeavored
by
means
of
coldness
and
even
at
times
harsh
words
to
make
her
comprehend
that
all
was
at
an
end
between
them
then
too
she
persisted
in
devising
ruses
for
summoning
him
to
rue
de
constantinople
and
he
was
in
constant
fear
that
the
two
women
would
some
day
meet
face
to
face
at
the
door
on
the
other
hand
his
affection
for
mme
de
marelle
had
increased
during
the
summer
they
were
both
bohemians
by
nature
they
took
excursions
together
to
argenteuil
bougival
maisons
and
poissy
and
when
he
was
forced
to
return
and
dine
at
mme
walter
he
detested
his
mature
mistress
more
thoroughly
as
he
recalled
the
youthful
one
he
had
just
left
he
was
congratulating
himself
upon
having
freed
himself
almost
entirely
from
the
former
clutches
when
he
received
the
telegram
above
mentioned
he
it
as
he
walked
along
he
thought
what
does
that
old
owl
want
with
me
i
am
certain
she
has
nothing
to
tell
me
except
that
she
adores
me
however
i
will
see
perhaps
there
is
some
truth
in
it
clotilde
is
coming
at
four
i
must
get
rid
of
the
other
one
at
three
or
soon
after
provided
they
do
not
meet
what
jades
women
are
as
he
uttered
those
words
he
was
reminded
of
his
wife
who
was
the
only
one
who
did
not
torment
him
she
lived
by
his
side
and
seemed
to
love
him
very
much
at
the
proper
time
for
she
never
permitted
anything
to
interfere
with
her
ordinary
occupations
of
life
he
strolled
toward
the
appointed
place
of
meeting
mentally
cursing
mme
walter
ah
i
will
receive
her
in
such
a
manner
that
she
will
not
tell
me
anything
first
of
all
i
will
give
her
to
understand
that
i
shall
never
cross
her
threshold
again
he
entered
to
await
her
she
soon
arrived
and
seeing
him
exclaimed
ah
you
received
my
dispatch
how
fortunate
yes
i
received
it
at
the
office
just
as
i
was
setting
out
for
the
chamber
what
do
you
want
he
asked
ungraciously
she
had
raised
her
veil
in
order
to
kiss
him
and
approached
him
timidly
and
humbly
with
the
air
of
a
beaten
dog
how
unkind
you
are
to
me
how
harshly
you
speak
what
have
i
done
to
you
you
do
not
know
what
i
have
suffered
for
you
he
muttered
are
you
going
to
begin
that
again
she
stood
near
him
awaiting
a
smile
a
word
of
encouragement
to
cast
herself
into
his
arms
and
whispered
you
need
not
have
won
me
to
treat
me
thus
you
might
have
left
me
virtuous
and
happy
do
you
remember
what
you
said
to
me
in
the
church
and
how
you
forced
me
to
enter
this
house
and
now
this
is
the
way
you
speak
to
me
receive
me
my
god
my
god
how
you
maltreat
me
he
stamped
his
foot
and
said
violently
enough
be
silent
i
can
never
see
you
a
moment
without
hearing
that
refrain
you
were
mature
when
you
gave
yourself
to
me
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
i
am
infinitely
grateful
but
i
need
not
be
tied
to
your
until
i
die
you
have
a
husband
and
i
a
wife
neither
of
us
is
free
it
was
all
a
caprice
and
now
it
is
at
an
end
she
said
how
brutal
you
are
how
coarse
and
villainous
no
i
was
no
longer
a
young
girl
but
i
had
never
loved
never
wavered
in
my
dignity
he
interrupted
her
i
know
it
you
have
told
me
that
twenty
times
but
you
have
had
two
children
she
drew
back
as
if
she
had
been
struck
oh
georges
and
pressing
her
hands
to
her
heart
she
burst
into
tears
when
she
began
to
weep
he
took
his
hat
ah
you
are
crying
again
good
evening
is
it
for
this
that
you
sent
for
me
she
took
a
step
forward
in
order
to
bar
the
way
and
drawing
a
handkerchief
from
her
pocket
she
wiped
her
eyes
her
voice
grew
steadier
no
i
came
to
to
give
you
political
news
to
give
you
the
means
of
earning
fifty
thousand
francs
or
even
more
if
you
wish
to
suddenly
softened
he
asked
how
by
chance
last
evening
i
heard
a
conversation
between
my
husband
and
laroche
walter
advised
the
minister
not
to
let
you
into
the
secret
for
you
would
expose
it
du
roy
placed
his
hat
upon
a
chair
and
listened
attentively
they
are
going
to
take
possession
of
morocco
why
i
lunched
with
laroche
this
morning
and
he
told
me
the
plans
no
my
dear
they
have
deceived
you
because
they
feared
their
secret
would
be
made
known
sit
down
said
georges
he
sank
into
an
armchair
while
she
drew
up
a
stool
and
took
her
seat
at
his
feet
she
continued
as
i
think
of
you
continually
i
pay
attention
to
what
is
talked
of
around
me
and
she
proceeded
to
tell
him
what
she
had
heard
relative
to
the
expedition
to
tangiers
which
had
been
decided
upon
the
day
that
laroche
assumed
his
office
she
told
him
how
they
had
little
by
little
bought
up
through
agents
who
aroused
no
suspicions
the
moroccan
loan
which
had
fallen
to
or
francs
how
when
the
expedition
was
entered
upon
the
french
government
would
guarantee
the
debt
and
their
friends
would
make
fifty
or
sixty
millions
he
cried
are
you
sure
of
that
she
replied
yes
i
am
sure
he
continued
that
is
indeed
fine
as
for
that
rascal
of
a
laroche
let
him
beware
i
will
get
his
ministerial
carcass
between
my
fingers
yet
then
after
a
moment
reflection
he
muttered
one
might
profit
by
that
you
too
can
buy
some
stock
said
she
it
is
only
francs
he
replied
but
i
have
no
ready
money
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
eyes
full
of
supplication
i
have
thought
of
that
my
darling
and
if
you
love
me
a
little
you
will
let
me
lend
it
to
you
he
replied
abruptly
almost
harshly
no
indeed
she
whispered
imploringly
listen
there
is
something
you
can
do
without
borrowing
money
i
intended
buying
ten
thousand
francs
worth
of
the
stock
instead
i
will
take
twenty
thousand
and
you
can
have
half
there
will
be
nothing
to
pay
at
once
if
it
succeeds
we
will
make
seventy
thousand
francs
if
not
you
will
owe
me
ten
thousand
which
you
can
repay
at
your
pleasure
he
said
again
no
i
do
not
like
those
combinations
she
tried
to
persuade
him
by
telling
him
that
she
advanced
nothing
that
the
payments
were
made
by
walter
bank
she
pointed
out
to
him
that
he
had
led
the
political
campaign
in
la
vie
francaise
and
that
he
would
be
very
simple
not
to
profit
by
the
results
he
had
helped
to
bring
about
as
he
still
hesitated
she
added
it
is
in
reality
walter
who
will
advance
the
money
and
you
have
done
enough
for
him
to
offset
that
sum
very
well
said
he
i
will
do
it
if
we
lose
i
will
pay
you
back
ten
thousand
francs
she
was
so
delighted
that
she
rose
took
his
head
between
her
hands
and
kissed
him
at
first
he
did
not
repulse
her
but
when
she
grew
more
lavish
with
her
caresses
he
said
come
that
will
do
she
gazed
at
him
sadly
oh
georges
i
can
no
longer
even
embrace
you
no
not
i
have
a
headache
she
reseated
herself
with
docility
at
his
feet
and
asked
will
you
dine
with
us
it
would
give
me
such
pleasure
he
hesitated
at
first
but
dared
not
refuse
yes
certainly
thank
you
dearest
she
rubbed
her
cheek
against
the
young
vest
as
she
did
so
one
of
her
long
black
hairs
caught
on
a
button
she
twisted
it
tightly
around
then
she
twisted
another
around
another
button
and
so
on
when
he
rose
he
would
tear
them
out
of
her
head
and
would
carry
away
with
him
unwittingly
a
lock
of
her
hair
it
would
be
an
invisible
bond
between
them
involuntarily
he
would
think
would
dream
of
her
he
would
love
her
a
little
more
the
next
day
suddenly
he
said
i
must
leave
you
for
i
am
expected
at
the
chamber
for
the
close
of
the
session
i
can
not
be
absent
she
sighed
already
then
adding
resignedly
go
my
darling
but
you
will
come
to
dinner
tomorrow
she
rose
abruptly
for
a
moment
she
felt
a
sharp
stinging
pain
as
if
needles
had
been
stuck
into
her
head
but
she
was
glad
to
have
suffered
for
him
adieu
said
she
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
eyes
coldly
then
she
offered
him
her
lips
which
he
brushed
lightly
as
he
said
come
come
let
us
hurry
it
is
after
three
she
passed
out
before
him
saying
at
seven
he
repeated
her
words
and
they
separated
du
roy
returned
at
four
to
await
his
mistress
she
was
somewhat
late
because
her
husband
had
come
home
for
a
week
she
asked
can
you
come
to
dinner
he
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
no
i
dine
at
the
walters
we
have
a
great
many
political
and
financial
matters
to
talk
over
she
took
off
her
hat
he
pointed
to
a
bag
on
the
mantelpiece
i
bought
you
some
sweetmeats
she
clapped
her
hands
what
a
darling
you
are
she
took
them
tasted
one
and
said
they
are
delicious
i
shall
not
leave
one
come
sit
down
in
the
armchair
i
will
sit
at
your
feet
and
eat
my
bonbons
he
smiled
as
he
saw
her
take
the
seat
a
short
while
since
occupied
by
mme
walter
she
too
called
him
darling
little
one
dearest
and
the
words
seemed
to
him
sweet
and
caressing
from
her
lips
while
from
mme
walter
they
irritated
and
nauseated
him
suddenly
he
remembered
the
seventy
thousand
francs
he
was
going
to
make
and
bluntly
interrupting
mme
de
marelle
chatter
he
said
listen
my
darling
i
am
going
to
intrust
you
with
a
message
to
your
husband
tell
him
from
me
to
buy
ten
thousand
francs
worth
of
moroccan
stock
which
is
at
and
i
predict
that
before
three
months
are
passed
he
will
have
made
eighty
thousand
francs
tell
him
to
maintain
absolute
silence
tell
him
that
the
expedition
to
tangiers
is
decided
upon
and
that
the
french
government
will
guarantee
the
moroccan
debt
it
is
a
state
secret
i
am
confiding
to
you
remember
she
listened
to
him
gravely
and
murmured
thank
you
i
will
tell
my
husband
this
evening
you
may
rely
upon
him
he
will
not
speak
of
it
he
can
be
depended
upon
there
is
no
danger
she
had
eaten
all
of
her
bonbons
and
began
to
toy
with
the
buttons
on
his
vest
suddenly
she
drew
a
long
hair
out
of
the
buttonhole
and
began
to
laugh
see
here
is
one
of
madeleine
hairs
you
are
a
faithful
husband
then
growing
serious
she
examined
the
scarcely
perceptible
thread
more
closely
and
said
it
is
not
madeleine
it
is
dark
he
smiled
it
probably
belongs
to
the
housemaid
but
she
glanced
at
the
vest
with
the
care
of
a
and
found
a
second
hair
twisted
around
a
second
button
then
she
saw
a
third
and
turning
pale
and
trembling
somewhat
she
exclaimed
oh
some
woman
has
left
hairs
around
all
your
buttons
in
surprise
he
stammered
why
you
you
are
mad
she
continued
to
unwind
the
hairs
and
cast
them
upon
the
floor
with
her
woman
instinct
she
had
divined
their
meaning
and
gasped
in
her
anger
ready
to
cry
she
loves
you
and
she
wished
you
to
carry
away
with
you
something
of
hers
oh
you
are
a
traitor
she
uttered
a
shrill
nervous
cry
oh
it
is
an
old
woman
hair
here
is
a
white
one
you
have
taken
a
fancy
to
an
old
woman
now
then
you
do
not
need
me
keep
the
other
one
she
rose
he
attempted
to
detain
her
and
stammered
no
clo
you
are
absurd
i
do
not
know
whose
it
is
listen
stay
see
stay
but
she
repeated
keep
your
old
woman
keep
her
have
a
chain
made
of
her
hair
of
her
gray
hair
there
is
enough
for
that
hastily
she
donned
her
hat
and
veil
and
when
he
attempted
to
touch
her
she
struck
him
in
the
face
and
made
her
escape
while
he
was
stunned
by
the
blow
when
he
found
that
he
was
alone
he
cursed
mme
walter
bathed
his
face
and
went
out
vowing
vengeance
that
time
he
would
not
pardon
no
indeed
he
strolled
to
the
boulevard
and
stopped
at
a
jeweler
to
look
at
a
chronometer
he
had
wanted
for
some
time
and
which
would
cost
eighteen
hundred
francs
he
thought
with
joy
if
i
make
my
seventy
thousand
francs
i
can
pay
for
it
and
he
began
to
dream
of
all
the
things
he
would
do
when
he
got
the
money
first
of
all
he
would
become
a
deputy
then
he
would
buy
the
chronometer
then
he
would
speculate
on
and
then
and
then
he
did
not
enter
the
office
preferring
to
confer
with
madeleine
before
seeing
walter
again
and
writing
his
article
he
turned
toward
home
he
reached
rue
drouot
when
he
paused
he
had
forgotten
to
inquire
for
count
de
vaudrec
who
lived
on
chaussee
he
retraced
his
steps
with
a
light
heart
thinking
of
a
thousand
things
of
the
fortune
he
would
make
of
that
rascal
of
a
laroche
and
of
old
walter
he
was
not
at
all
uneasy
as
to
clotilde
anger
knowing
that
she
would
soon
forgive
him
when
he
asked
the
janitor
of
the
house
in
which
count
de
vaudrec
lived
how
is
de
vaudrec
i
have
heard
that
he
has
been
ailing
of
late
the
man
replied
the
count
is
very
ill
sir
they
think
he
will
not
live
through
the
night
the
gout
has
reached
his
heart
du
roy
was
so
startled
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
vaudrec
dying
he
stammered
thanks
i
will
call
again
unconscious
of
what
he
was
saying
he
jumped
into
a
cab
and
drove
home
his
wife
had
returned
he
entered
her
room
out
of
breath
did
you
know
vaudrec
is
dying
she
was
reading
a
letter
and
turning
to
him
asked
what
did
you
say
i
said
that
vaudrec
is
dying
of
an
attack
of
gout
then
he
added
what
shall
you
do
she
rose
her
face
was
livid
she
burst
into
tears
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
she
remained
standing
shaken
by
sobs
torn
by
anguish
suddenly
she
conquered
her
grief
and
wiping
her
eyes
said
i
am
going
to
him
do
not
worry
about
me
i
do
not
know
what
time
i
shall
return
do
not
expect
me
he
replied
very
well
go
they
shook
hands
and
she
left
in
such
haste
that
she
forgot
her
gloves
georges
after
dining
alone
began
to
write
his
article
he
wrote
it
according
to
the
minister
instructions
hinting
to
the
readers
that
the
expedition
to
morocco
would
not
take
place
he
took
it
when
completed
to
the
office
conversed
several
moments
with
walter
and
set
out
again
smoking
with
a
light
heart
he
knew
not
why
his
wife
had
not
returned
he
retired
and
fell
asleep
toward
midnight
madeleine
came
home
georges
sat
up
in
bed
and
asked
well
he
had
never
seen
her
so
pale
and
agitated
she
whispered
he
is
dead
ah
and
he
told
you
nothing
nothing
he
was
unconscious
when
i
arrived
questions
which
he
dared
not
ask
arose
to
georges
lips
lie
down
and
rest
said
he
she
disrobed
hastily
and
slipped
into
bed
he
continued
had
he
any
relatives
at
his
only
a
nephew
ah
did
he
often
see
that
nephew
they
had
not
met
for
ten
years
had
he
other
relatives
no
i
believe
not
will
that
nephew
be
his
heir
i
do
not
know
was
vaudrec
very
rich
yes
very
do
you
know
what
he
was
worth
no
not
exactly
one
or
two
millions
perhaps
he
said
no
more
she
extinguished
the
light
he
could
not
sleep
he
looked
upon
mme
walter
promised
seventy
thousand
francs
as
very
insignificant
suddenly
he
thought
he
heard
madeleine
crying
in
order
to
insure
himself
he
asked
are
you
asleep
no
her
voice
was
tearful
and
unsteady
he
continued
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
your
minister
has
deceived
us
how
he
gave
her
a
detailed
account
of
the
combination
prepared
by
laroche
and
walter
when
he
concluded
she
asked
how
did
you
know
that
he
replied
pardon
me
if
i
do
not
tell
you
you
have
your
means
of
obtaining
information
into
which
i
do
not
inquire
i
have
mine
which
i
desire
to
keep
i
can
vouch
at
any
rate
for
the
truth
of
my
statements
she
muttered
it
may
be
possible
i
suspected
that
they
were
doing
something
without
our
knowledge
as
she
spoke
georges
drew
near
her
she
paid
no
heed
to
his
proximity
however
and
turning
toward
the
wall
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
chapter
xiv
the
will
the
church
was
draped
in
black
and
over
the
door
a
large
escutcheon
surmounted
by
a
coronet
announced
to
the
that
a
nobleman
was
being
buried
the
ceremony
was
just
over
those
present
went
out
slowly
passing
by
the
coffin
and
by
count
de
vaudrec
nephew
who
shook
hands
and
returned
salutations
when
georges
du
roy
and
his
wife
left
the
church
they
walked
along
side
by
side
on
their
way
home
they
did
not
speak
they
were
both
preoccupied
at
length
georges
said
as
if
talking
to
himself
truly
it
is
very
astonishing
madeleine
asked
what
my
friend
that
vaudrec
left
us
nothing
she
blushed
and
said
why
should
he
leave
us
anything
had
he
any
reason
for
doing
so
then
after
several
moments
of
silence
she
continued
perhaps
there
is
a
will
at
a
lawyer
we
should
not
know
of
it
he
replied
that
is
possible
for
he
was
our
best
friend
he
dined
with
us
twice
a
week
he
came
at
any
time
he
was
at
home
with
us
he
loved
you
as
a
father
he
had
no
family
no
children
no
brothers
nor
sisters
only
a
nephew
yes
there
should
be
a
will
i
would
not
care
for
much
a
remembrance
to
prove
that
he
thought
of
us
that
he
recognized
the
affection
we
felt
for
him
we
should
certainly
have
a
mark
of
friendship
she
said
with
a
pensive
and
indifferent
air
it
is
possible
that
there
is
a
will
when
they
entered
the
house
the
footman
handed
madeleine
a
letter
she
opened
it
and
offered
it
to
her
husband
office
of
lamaneur
notary
rue
des
vosges
madame
kindly
call
at
my
office
at
a
quarter
past
two
tuesday
wednesday
or
thursday
on
business
which
concerns
you
yours
respectfully
lamaneur
georges
in
his
turn
colored
that
is
as
it
should
be
it
is
strange
however
that
he
should
write
to
you
and
not
to
me
for
i
am
the
head
of
the
family
legally
shall
we
go
at
once
she
asked
yes
i
should
like
to
after
luncheon
they
set
out
for
lamaneur
office
the
notary
was
a
short
round
man
round
all
over
his
head
looked
like
a
ball
fastened
to
another
ball
which
was
supported
by
legs
so
short
that
they
too
almost
resembled
balls
he
bowed
as
du
roy
and
his
wife
were
shown
into
his
office
pointed
to
seats
and
said
turning
to
madeleine
madame
i
sent
for
you
in
order
to
inform
you
of
count
de
vaudrec
will
which
will
be
of
interest
to
you
georges
could
not
help
muttering
i
suspected
that
the
notary
continued
i
shall
read
you
the
document
which
is
very
brief
the
undersigned
paul
emile
cyprien
gontran
count
de
vaudrec
sound
both
in
body
and
mind
here
express
my
last
wishes
as
death
might
take
me
away
at
any
moment
i
wish
to
take
the
precaution
of
drawing
up
my
will
to
be
deposited
with
m
lamaneur
no
direct
heirs
i
bequeath
all
my
fortune
comprising
stocks
and
bonds
for
six
hundred
thousand
francs
and
landed
property
for
five
hundred
thousand
to
mme
claire
madeleine
du
roy
unconditionally
i
beg
her
to
accept
that
gift
from
a
dead
friend
as
a
proof
of
devoted
profound
and
respectful
affection
the
notary
said
that
is
all
that
document
bears
the
date
of
august
last
and
took
the
place
of
one
of
the
same
nature
made
two
years
ago
in
the
name
of
mme
claire
madeleine
forestier
i
have
the
first
will
which
would
prove
in
case
of
contestation
on
the
part
of
the
family
that
count
de
vaudrec
had
not
changed
his
mind
madeleine
cast
down
her
eyes
her
cheeks
were
pale
georges
nervously
twisted
his
mustache
the
notary
continued
after
a
moment
pause
it
is
of
course
understood
that
madame
can
not
accept
that
legacy
without
your
consent
du
roy
rose
and
said
shortly
i
ask
time
for
reflection
the
notary
smiled
bowed
and
replied
pleasantly
i
comprehend
the
scruples
which
cause
you
to
hesitate
i
may
add
that
de
nephew
who
was
informed
this
morning
of
his
uncle
last
wishes
expresses
himself
as
ready
to
respect
them
if
he
be
given
one
hundred
thousand
francs
in
my
opinion
the
will
can
not
be
broken
but
a
lawsuit
would
cause
a
sensation
which
you
would
probably
like
to
avoid
the
world
often
judges
uncharitably
can
you
let
me
have
your
reply
before
saturday
georges
bowed
and
together
with
his
wife
left
the
office
when
they
arrived
home
du
roy
closed
the
door
and
throwing
his
hat
on
the
bed
asked
what
were
the
relations
between
you
and
vaudrec
madeleine
who
was
taking
off
her
veil
turned
around
with
a
shudder
between
us
yes
between
you
and
him
one
does
not
leave
one
entire
fortune
to
a
woman
unless
she
trembled
and
could
scarcely
take
out
the
pins
which
fastened
the
transparent
tissue
then
she
stammered
in
an
agitated
manner
you
are
mad
you
are
you
are
you
did
not
think
he
would
leave
you
anything
georges
replied
emphazing
each
word
yes
he
could
have
left
me
something
me
your
husband
his
friend
but
not
you
my
wife
and
his
friend
the
distinction
is
material
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
madeleine
gazed
at
him
fixedly
it
seems
to
me
that
the
world
would
have
considered
a
legacy
from
him
to
you
very
strange
why
because
she
hesitated
then
continued
because
you
are
my
husband
because
you
were
not
well
acquainted
because
i
have
been
his
friend
so
long
because
his
first
will
made
during
forestier
lifetime
was
already
in
my
favor
georges
began
to
pace
to
and
fro
he
finally
said
you
can
not
accept
that
she
answered
indifferently
very
well
it
is
not
necessary
then
to
wait
until
saturday
you
can
inform
lamaneur
at
once
he
paused
before
her
and
they
gazed
into
one
another
eyes
as
if
by
that
mute
and
ardent
interrogation
they
were
trying
to
examine
each
other
consciences
in
a
low
voice
he
murmured
come
confess
your
relations
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
are
absurd
vaudrec
was
very
fond
of
me
very
but
there
was
nothing
more
never
he
stamped
his
foot
you
lie
it
is
not
possible
she
replied
calmly
it
is
so
nevertheless
he
resumed
his
pacing
to
and
fro
then
pausing
again
he
said
explain
to
me
then
why
he
left
all
his
fortune
to
you
she
did
so
with
a
nonchalant
air
it
is
very
simple
as
you
said
just
now
we
were
his
only
friends
or
rather
i
was
his
only
friend
for
he
knew
me
when
a
child
my
mother
was
a
governess
in
his
father
house
he
came
here
continually
and
as
he
had
no
legal
heirs
he
selected
me
it
is
possible
that
he
even
loved
me
a
little
but
what
woman
has
never
been
loved
thus
he
brought
me
flowers
every
monday
you
were
never
surprised
at
that
and
he
never
brought
you
any
he
leaves
me
his
fortune
for
the
same
reason
because
he
had
no
one
else
to
leave
it
to
it
would
on
the
other
hand
have
been
extremely
surprising
if
he
had
left
it
to
you
why
what
are
you
to
him
she
spoke
so
naturally
and
so
calmly
that
georges
hesitated
before
replying
it
makes
no
difference
we
can
not
accept
that
bequest
under
those
conditions
everyone
would
talk
about
it
and
laugh
at
me
my
are
already
too
much
disposed
to
be
jealous
of
me
and
to
attack
me
i
have
to
be
especially
careful
of
my
honor
and
my
reputation
i
can
not
permit
my
wife
to
accept
a
legacy
of
that
kind
from
a
man
whom
rumor
has
already
assigned
to
her
as
her
lover
forestier
might
perhaps
have
tolerated
that
but
i
shall
not
she
replied
gently
very
well
my
dear
we
will
not
take
it
it
will
be
a
million
less
in
our
pockets
that
is
all
georges
paced
the
room
and
uttered
his
thoughts
aloud
thus
speaking
to
his
wife
without
addressing
her
yes
a
million
so
much
the
worse
he
did
not
think
when
making
his
will
what
a
breach
of
etiquette
he
was
committing
he
did
not
realize
in
what
a
false
ridiculous
position
he
was
placing
me
he
should
have
left
half
of
it
to
me
that
would
have
made
matters
right
he
seated
himself
crossed
his
legs
and
began
to
twist
the
ends
of
his
mustache
as
was
his
custom
when
annoyed
uneasy
or
pondering
over
a
weighty
question
madeleine
took
up
a
piece
of
embroidery
upon
which
she
worked
occasionally
and
said
i
have
nothing
to
say
you
must
decide
it
was
some
time
before
he
replied
then
he
said
hesitatingly
the
world
would
never
understand
how
it
was
that
vaudrec
constituted
you
his
sole
heiress
and
that
i
allowed
it
to
accept
that
legacy
would
be
to
avow
guilty
relations
on
your
part
and
an
infamous
lack
of
on
mine
do
you
know
how
the
acceptance
of
it
might
be
interpreted
we
should
have
to
find
some
adroit
means
of
palliating
it
we
should
have
to
give
people
to
suppose
for
instance
that
he
divided
his
fortune
between
us
giving
half
to
you
and
half
to
me
she
said
i
do
not
see
how
that
can
be
done
since
there
is
a
formal
will
he
replied
oh
that
is
very
simple
we
have
no
children
you
can
therefore
deed
me
part
of
the
inheritance
in
that
way
we
can
silence
malignant
tongues
she
answered
somewhat
impatiently
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
silence
malignant
tongues
since
the
will
is
there
signed
by
vaudrec
he
said
angrily
do
you
need
to
exhibit
it
or
affix
it
to
the
door
you
are
absurd
we
will
say
that
the
fortune
was
left
us
jointly
by
count
de
vaudrec
that
is
all
you
can
not
moreover
accept
the
legacy
without
my
authority
i
will
only
consent
on
the
condition
of
a
partition
which
will
prevent
me
from
becoming
a
for
the
world
she
glanced
sharply
at
him
as
you
will
i
am
ready
he
seemed
to
hesitate
again
rose
paced
the
floor
and
avoiding
his
wife
piercing
gaze
he
said
no
decidedly
no
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
renounce
it
altogether
it
would
be
more
correct
more
honorable
from
the
nature
of
the
bequest
even
people
would
suspect
illicit
relations
he
paused
before
madeleine
if
you
like
my
darling
i
will
return
to
lamaneur
alone
to
consult
him
and
to
explain
the
matter
to
him
i
will
tell
him
of
my
scruples
and
i
will
add
that
we
have
agreed
to
divide
it
in
order
to
avoid
any
scandal
from
the
moment
that
i
accept
a
portion
of
the
inheritance
it
will
be
evident
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
i
can
say
wife
accepts
it
because
i
her
husband
accept
i
who
am
the
best
judge
of
what
she
can
do
without
compromising
herself
madeleine
simply
murmured
as
you
wish
he
continued
yes
it
will
be
as
clear
as
day
if
that
is
done
we
inherit
a
fortune
from
a
friend
who
wished
to
make
no
distinction
between
us
thereby
showing
that
his
liking
for
you
was
purely
platonic
you
may
be
sure
that
if
he
had
given
it
a
thought
that
is
what
he
would
have
done
he
did
not
reflect
he
did
not
foresee
the
consequences
as
you
said
just
now
he
offered
you
flowers
every
week
he
left
you
his
wealth
she
interrupted
him
with
a
shade
of
annoyance
i
understand
no
more
explanations
are
necessary
go
to
the
notary
at
once
he
stammered
in
confusion
you
are
right
i
will
go
he
took
his
hat
and
as
he
was
leaving
the
room
he
asked
shall
i
try
to
compromise
with
the
nephew
for
fifty
thousand
francs
she
replied
haughtily
no
give
him
the
hundred
thousand
francs
he
demands
and
take
them
from
my
share
if
you
wish
abashed
he
murmured
no
we
will
share
it
after
deducting
fifty
thousand
francs
each
we
will
still
have
a
million
net
then
he
added
until
later
my
little
made
he
proceeded
to
the
notary
to
explain
the
arrangement
decided
upon
which
he
claimed
originated
with
his
wife
the
following
day
they
signed
a
deed
for
five
hundred
thousand
francs
which
madeleine
du
roy
gave
up
to
her
husband
on
leaving
the
office
as
it
was
pleasant
georges
proposed
that
they
take
a
stroll
along
the
boulevards
he
was
very
tender
very
careful
of
her
and
laughed
joyously
while
she
remained
pensive
and
grave
it
was
a
cold
autumn
day
the
pedestrians
seemed
in
haste
and
walked
along
rapidly
du
roy
led
his
wife
to
the
shop
into
the
windows
of
which
he
had
so
often
gazed
at
the
coveted
chronometer
shall
i
buy
you
some
trinket
he
asked
she
replied
indifferently
as
you
like
they
entered
the
shop
what
would
you
prefer
a
necklace
a
bracelet
or
earrings
the
sight
of
the
brilliant
gems
made
her
eyes
sparkle
in
spite
of
herself
as
she
glanced
at
the
cases
filled
with
costly
baubles
suddenly
she
exclaimed
there
is
a
lovely
bracelet
it
was
a
chain
very
unique
in
shape
every
link
of
which
was
set
with
a
different
stone
georges
asked
how
much
is
that
bracelet
the
jeweler
replied
three
thousand
francs
sir
if
you
will
let
me
have
it
for
two
thousand
five
hundred
i
will
take
it
the
man
hesitated
then
replied
no
sir
it
is
impossible
du
roy
said
see
here
throw
in
this
chronometer
at
fifteen
hundred
francs
that
makes
four
thousand
and
i
will
pay
cash
if
you
do
not
agree
i
will
go
somewhere
else
the
jeweler
finally
yielded
very
well
sir
the
journalist
after
leaving
his
address
said
you
can
have
my
initials
interlaced
below
a
baron
crown
engraved
on
the
chronometer
madeleine
in
surprise
smiled
and
when
they
left
the
shop
she
took
his
arm
quite
affectionately
she
thought
him
very
shrewd
and
clever
he
was
right
now
that
he
had
a
fortune
he
must
have
a
title
they
passed
the
vaudeville
on
their
way
arid
entering
secured
a
box
then
they
repaired
to
mme
de
marelle
at
georges
suggestion
to
invite
her
to
spend
the
evening
with
them
georges
rather
dreaded
the
first
meeting
with
clotilde
but
she
did
not
seem
to
bear
him
any
malice
or
even
to
remember
their
disagreement
the
dinner
which
they
took
at
a
restaurant
was
excellent
and
the
evening
altogether
enjoyable
georges
and
madeleine
returned
home
late
the
gas
was
extinguished
and
in
order
to
light
the
way
the
journalist
from
time
to
time
struck
a
match
on
reaching
the
landing
on
the
first
floor
they
saw
their
reflections
in
the
mirror
du
roy
raised
his
hand
with
the
lighted
match
in
it
in
order
to
distinguish
their
images
more
clearly
and
said
with
a
triumphant
smile
the
millionaires
are
passing
by
chapter
xv
suzanne
morocco
had
been
conquered
france
the
mistress
of
tangiers
had
guaranteed
the
debt
of
the
annexed
country
it
was
rumored
that
two
ministers
being
one
of
them
had
made
twenty
millions
as
for
walter
in
a
few
days
he
had
become
one
of
the
masters
of
the
world
a
financier
more
omnipotent
than
a
king
he
was
no
longer
the
jew
walter
the
director
of
a
bank
the
proprietor
of
a
yellow
newspaper
he
was
walter
the
wealthy
israelite
and
he
wished
to
prove
it
knowing
the
straitened
circumstances
of
the
prince
de
carlsbourg
who
owned
one
of
the
fairest
mansions
on
rue
du
faubourg
he
proposed
to
buy
it
he
offered
three
million
francs
for
it
the
prince
tempted
by
the
sum
accepted
his
offer
the
next
day
walter
took
possession
of
his
new
dwelling
then
another
idea
occurred
to
him
an
idea
of
conquering
all
paris
an
idea
a
la
bonaparte
at
that
time
everyone
was
raving
over
a
painting
by
the
hungarian
karl
marcovitch
exhibited
by
jacques
lenoble
and
representing
christ
walking
on
the
water
art
critics
enthusiastically
declared
it
to
be
the
most
magnificent
painting
of
the
age
walter
bought
it
thereby
causing
entire
paris
to
talk
of
him
to
envy
him
to
censure
or
approve
his
action
he
issued
an
announcement
in
the
papers
that
everyone
was
invited
to
come
on
a
certain
evening
to
see
it
du
roy
was
jealous
of
walter
success
he
had
thought
himself
wealthy
with
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
extorted
from
his
wife
and
now
he
felt
poor
as
he
compared
his
paltry
fortune
with
the
shower
of
millions
around
him
his
envious
rage
increased
daily
he
cherished
ill
will
toward
everyone
toward
the
walters
even
toward
his
wife
and
above
all
toward
the
man
who
had
deceived
him
made
use
of
him
and
who
dined
twice
a
week
at
his
house
georges
acted
as
his
secretary
agent
mouthpiece
and
when
he
wrote
at
his
dictation
he
felt
a
mad
desire
to
strangle
him
laroche
reigned
supreme
in
the
du
roy
household
having
taken
the
place
of
count
de
vaudrec
he
spoke
to
the
servants
as
if
he
were
their
master
georges
submitted
to
it
all
like
a
dog
which
wishes
to
bite
and
dares
not
but
he
was
often
harsh
and
brutal
to
madeleine
who
merely
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
treated
him
as
one
would
a
fretful
child
she
was
surprised
too
at
his
constant
ill
humor
and
said
i
do
not
understand
you
you
are
always
complaining
your
position
is
excellent
his
only
reply
was
to
turn
his
back
upon
her
he
declared
that
he
would
not
attend
walter
fete
that
he
would
not
cross
the
miserable
jew
threshold
for
two
months
mme
walter
had
written
to
him
daily
beseeching
him
to
come
to
see
her
to
appoint
a
meeting
where
he
would
in
order
that
she
might
give
him
the
seventy
thousand
francs
she
had
made
for
him
he
did
not
reply
and
threw
her
letters
into
the
fire
not
that
he
would
have
refused
to
accept
his
share
of
the
profits
but
he
enjoyed
treating
her
scornfully
trampling
her
under
foot
she
was
too
wealthy
he
would
be
inflexible
the
day
of
the
exhibition
of
the
picture
as
madeleine
chided
him
for
not
going
he
replied
leave
me
in
peace
i
shall
remain
at
home
after
they
had
dined
he
said
suddenly
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
through
with
it
get
ready
quickly
i
shall
be
ready
in
fifteen
minutes
she
said
as
they
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
hotel
de
carlsbourg
it
was
one
blaze
of
light
a
magnificent
carpet
was
spread
upon
the
steps
leading
to
the
entrance
and
upon
each
one
stood
a
man
in
livery
as
rigid
as
marble
du
roy
heart
was
torn
with
jealousy
he
and
his
wife
ascended
the
steps
and
gave
their
wraps
to
the
footmen
who
approached
them
at
the
entrance
to
the
two
children
one
in
pink
the
other
in
blue
handed
bouquets
to
the
ladies
the
rooms
were
already
well
filled
the
majority
of
the
ladies
were
in
street
costumes
a
proof
that
they
came
thither
as
they
would
go
to
any
exhibition
the
few
who
intended
to
remain
to
the
ball
which
was
to
follow
wore
evening
dress
mme
walter
surrounded
by
friends
stood
in
the
second
salon
and
received
the
visitors
many
did
not
know
her
and
walked
through
the
rooms
as
if
in
a
museum
without
paying
any
heed
to
the
host
and
hostess
when
virginie
perceived
du
roy
she
grew
livid
and
made
a
movement
toward
him
then
she
paused
and
waited
for
him
to
advance
he
bowed
ceremoniously
while
madeleine
greeted
her
effusively
georges
left
his
wife
near
mme
walter
and
mingled
with
the
guests
five
opened
one
into
the
other
they
were
carpeted
with
rich
oriental
rugs
and
upon
their
walls
hung
paintings
by
the
old
masters
as
he
made
his
way
through
the
throng
some
one
seized
his
arm
and
a
fresh
youthful
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
ah
here
you
are
at
last
naughty
why
do
we
never
see
you
any
more
it
was
suzanne
walter
with
her
azure
eyes
and
wealth
of
golden
hair
he
was
delighted
to
see
her
and
apologized
as
they
shook
hands
i
have
been
so
busy
for
two
months
that
i
have
been
nowhere
she
replied
gravely
that
is
too
bad
you
have
grieved
us
deeply
for
mamma
and
i
adore
you
as
for
myself
i
can
not
do
without
you
if
you
are
not
here
i
am
bored
to
death
you
see
i
tell
you
so
frankly
that
you
will
not
remain
away
like
that
any
more
give
me
your
arm
i
will
show
you
walking
on
the
water
myself
it
is
at
the
very
end
behind
the
conservatory
papa
put
it
back
there
so
that
everyone
would
be
obliged
to
go
through
the
rooms
it
is
astonishing
how
proud
papa
is
of
this
house
as
they
walked
through
the
rooms
all
turned
to
look
at
that
handsome
man
and
that
bewitching
girl
a
painter
said
there
is
a
fine
couple
georges
thought
if
my
position
had
been
made
i
would
have
married
her
why
did
i
never
think
of
it
how
could
i
have
taken
the
other
one
what
folly
one
always
acts
too
hastily
one
never
reflects
sufficiently
and
longing
bitter
longing
possessed
him
corrupting
all
his
pleasure
rendering
life
odious
suzanne
said
you
must
come
often
we
can
do
anything
we
like
now
papa
is
rich
he
replied
oh
you
will
soon
marry
some
prince
perhaps
and
we
shall
never
meet
any
more
she
cried
frankly
oh
oh
i
shall
not
i
shall
choose
some
one
i
love
very
dearly
i
am
rich
enough
for
two
he
smiled
ironically
and
said
i
give
you
six
months
by
that
time
you
will
be
madame
la
marquise
madame
la
duchesse
or
madame
la
princesse
and
you
will
look
down
upon
me
mademoiselle
she
pretended
to
be
angry
patted
his
arm
with
her
fan
and
vowed
that
she
would
marry
according
to
the
dictates
of
her
heart
he
replied
we
shall
see
you
are
too
wealthy
you
too
have
inherited
some
money
barely
twenty
thousand
livres
a
year
it
is
a
mere
pittance
nowadays
but
your
wife
has
the
same
yes
we
have
a
million
together
forty
thousand
a
year
we
can
not
even
keep
a
carriage
on
that
they
had
in
the
meantime
reached
the
last
and
before
them
lay
the
conservatory
with
its
rare
shrubs
and
plants
to
their
left
under
a
dome
of
palms
was
a
marble
basin
on
the
edges
of
which
four
large
swans
of
delftware
emitted
the
water
from
their
beaks
the
journalist
stopped
and
said
to
himself
this
is
luxury
this
is
the
kind
of
house
in
which
to
live
why
can
i
not
have
one
his
companion
did
not
speak
he
looked
at
her
and
thought
once
more
if
i
only
had
taken
her
suddenly
suzanne
seemed
to
awaken
from
her
reverie
come
said
she
dragging
georges
through
a
group
which
barred
their
way
and
turning
him
to
the
right
before
him
surrounded
by
verdure
on
all
sides
was
the
picture
one
had
to
look
closely
at
it
in
order
to
understand
it
it
was
a
grand
work
the
work
of
a
master
one
of
those
triumphs
of
art
which
furnishes
one
for
years
with
food
for
thought
du
roy
gazed
at
it
for
some
time
and
then
turned
away
to
make
room
for
others
suzanne
tiny
hand
still
rested
upon
his
arm
she
asked
would
you
like
a
glass
of
champagne
we
will
go
to
the
buffet
we
shall
find
papa
there
slowly
they
traversed
the
crowded
rooms
suddenly
georges
heard
a
voice
say
that
is
laroche
and
mme
du
roy
he
turned
and
saw
his
wife
passing
upon
the
minister
arm
they
were
talking
in
low
tones
and
smiling
into
each
other
eyes
he
fancied
he
saw
some
people
whisper
as
they
gazed
at
them
and
he
felt
a
desire
to
fall
upon
those
two
beings
and
smite
them
to
the
earth
his
wife
was
making
a
of
him
who
was
she
a
shrewd
little
parvenue
that
was
all
he
could
never
make
his
way
with
a
wife
who
compromised
him
she
would
be
a
in
his
path
ah
if
he
had
foreseen
if
he
had
known
he
would
have
played
for
higher
stakes
what
a
brilliant
match
he
might
have
made
with
little
suzanne
how
could
he
have
been
so
blind
they
reached
the
with
its
marble
columns
and
walls
hung
with
old
gobelins
tapestry
walter
spied
his
editor
and
hastened
to
shake
hands
he
was
beside
himself
with
joy
have
you
seen
everything
say
suzanne
have
you
shown
him
everything
what
a
lot
of
people
eh
have
you
seen
prince
de
guerche
he
just
drank
a
glass
of
punch
then
he
pounced
upon
senator
rissolin
and
his
wife
a
gentleman
greeted
suzanne
a
tall
slender
man
with
fair
whiskers
and
a
worldly
air
georges
heard
her
call
him
marquis
de
cazolles
and
he
was
suddenly
inspired
with
jealousy
how
long
had
she
known
him
since
she
had
become
wealthy
no
doubt
he
saw
in
him
a
possible
suitor
some
one
seized
his
arm
it
was
norbert
de
varenne
the
old
poet
said
this
is
what
they
call
amusing
themselves
after
a
while
they
will
dance
then
they
will
retire
and
the
young
girls
will
be
satisfied
take
some
champagne
it
is
excellent
georges
scarcely
heard
his
words
he
was
looking
for
suzanne
who
had
gone
off
with
the
marquis
de
cazolles
he
left
norbert
de
varenne
abruptly
and
went
in
pursuit
of
the
young
girl
the
thirsty
crowd
stopped
him
when
he
had
made
his
way
through
it
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
and
mme
de
marelle
he
had
often
met
the
wife
but
he
had
not
met
the
husband
for
some
time
the
latter
grasped
both
of
his
hands
and
thanked
him
for
the
message
he
had
sent
him
by
clotilde
relative
to
the
stocks
du
roy
replied
in
exchange
for
that
service
i
shall
take
your
wife
or
rather
offer
her
my
arm
husband
and
wife
should
always
be
separated
de
marelle
bowed
very
well
if
i
lose
you
we
can
meet
here
again
in
an
hour
the
two
young
people
disappeared
in
the
crowd
followed
by
the
husband
mme
de
marelle
said
there
are
two
girls
who
will
have
twenty
or
thirty
millions
each
and
suzanne
is
pretty
in
the
bargain
he
made
no
reply
his
own
thought
coming
from
the
lips
of
another
irritated
him
he
took
clotilde
to
see
the
painting
as
they
crossed
the
conservatory
he
saw
his
wife
seated
near
both
of
them
almost
hidden
behind
a
group
of
plants
they
seemed
to
say
we
are
having
a
meeting
in
public
for
we
do
not
care
for
the
opinion
mme
de
marelle
admired
karl
marcovitch
painting
and
they
turned
to
repair
to
the
other
rooms
they
were
separated
from
de
marelle
he
asked
is
laurine
still
vexed
with
me
yes
she
refuses
to
see
you
and
goes
away
when
you
are
mentioned
he
did
not
reply
the
child
sudden
enmity
grieved
and
annoyed
him
suzanne
met
them
at
a
door
and
cried
oh
here
you
are
now
you
are
going
to
be
left
alone
for
i
shall
take
clotilde
to
see
my
room
and
the
two
women
glided
through
the
throng
at
that
moment
a
voice
at
his
side
murmured
georges
it
was
mme
walter
she
continued
in
a
low
voice
how
cruel
you
are
how
needlessly
you
inflict
suffering
upon
me
i
bade
suzanne
take
that
woman
away
that
i
might
have
a
word
with
you
listen
i
must
speak
to
you
this
evening
or
or
you
do
not
know
what
i
shall
do
go
into
the
conservatory
you
will
find
a
door
to
the
left
through
which
you
can
reach
the
garden
follow
the
walk
directly
in
front
of
you
at
the
end
of
it
you
will
see
an
arbor
expect
me
in
ten
minutes
if
you
do
not
meet
me
i
swear
i
will
cause
a
scandal
here
at
once
he
replied
haughtily
very
well
i
shall
be
at
the
place
you
named
in
ten
minutes
but
jacques
rival
detained
him
when
he
reached
the
alley
he
saw
mme
walter
in
front
of
him
she
cried
ah
here
you
are
do
you
wish
to
kill
me
he
replied
calmly
i
beseech
you
none
of
that
or
i
shall
leave
you
at
once
throwing
her
arms
around
his
neck
she
exclaimed
what
have
i
done
to
you
that
you
should
treat
me
so
he
tried
to
push
her
away
you
twisted
your
hair
around
my
coat
buttons
the
last
time
we
met
and
it
caused
trouble
between
my
wife
and
myself
she
shook
her
head
ah
your
wife
would
not
care
it
was
one
of
your
mistresses
who
made
a
scene
i
have
none
indeed
why
do
you
never
come
to
see
me
why
do
you
refuse
to
dine
with
me
even
once
a
week
i
have
no
other
thoughts
than
of
you
i
suffer
terribly
you
can
not
understand
that
your
image
always
present
closes
my
throat
stifles
me
and
leaves
me
scarcely
strength
enough
to
move
my
limbs
in
order
to
walk
so
i
remain
all
day
in
my
chair
thinking
of
you
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
these
were
the
words
of
a
desperate
woman
capable
of
anything
he
however
cherished
a
vague
project
and
replied
my
dear
love
is
not
eternal
one
loves
and
one
ceases
to
love
when
it
lasts
it
becomes
a
drawback
i
want
none
of
it
however
if
you
will
be
reasonable
and
will
receive
and
treat
me
as
a
friend
i
will
come
to
see
you
as
formerly
can
you
do
that
she
murmured
i
can
do
anything
in
order
to
see
you
then
it
is
agreed
that
we
are
to
be
friends
nothing
more
she
gasped
it
is
agreed
offering
him
her
lips
she
cried
in
her
despair
one
more
kiss
one
last
kiss
he
gently
drew
back
no
we
must
adhere
to
our
rules
she
turned
her
head
and
wiped
away
two
tears
then
drawing
from
her
bosom
a
package
of
notes
tied
with
pink
ribbon
she
held
it
toward
du
roy
here
is
your
share
of
the
profits
in
that
moroccan
affair
i
was
so
glad
to
make
it
for
you
here
take
it
he
refused
no
i
can
not
accept
that
money
she
became
excited
oh
you
will
not
refuse
it
now
it
is
yours
yours
alone
if
you
do
not
take
it
i
will
throw
it
in
the
sewer
you
will
not
refuse
it
georges
he
took
the
package
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
we
must
return
to
the
house
you
will
take
cold
so
much
the
better
if
i
could
but
die
she
seized
his
hand
kissed
it
passionately
and
fled
toward
the
house
he
returned
more
leisurely
and
entered
the
conservatory
with
head
erect
and
smiling
lips
his
wife
and
laroche
were
no
longer
there
the
crowd
had
grown
thinner
suzanne
leaning
on
her
sister
arm
advanced
toward
him
in
a
few
moments
rose
whom
they
teased
about
a
certain
count
turned
upon
her
heel
and
left
them
du
roy
finding
himself
alone
with
suzanne
said
in
a
caressing
voice
listen
my
dear
little
one
do
you
really
consider
me
a
friend
why
yes
you
have
faith
in
me
perfect
faith
do
you
remember
what
i
said
to
you
a
while
since
about
what
about
your
marriage
or
rather
the
man
you
would
marry
yes
well
will
you
promise
me
one
thing
yes
what
is
it
to
consult
me
when
you
receive
a
proposal
and
to
accept
no
one
without
asking
my
advice
yes
i
will
gladly
and
it
is
to
be
a
secret
between
us
not
a
word
to
your
father
or
mother
not
a
word
rival
approached
them
saying
mademoiselle
your
father
wants
you
in
the
ballroom
she
said
come
but
he
refused
for
he
had
decided
to
leave
at
once
wishing
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
he
went
in
search
of
his
wife
and
found
her
drinking
chocolate
at
the
buffet
with
two
strange
men
she
introduced
her
husband
without
naming
them
in
a
short
while
he
asked
shall
we
go
whenever
you
like
she
took
his
arm
and
they
passed
through
the
almost
deserted
rooms
madeleine
asked
where
is
mme
walter
i
should
like
to
bid
her
it
is
unnecessary
she
would
try
to
keep
us
in
the
ballroom
and
i
have
had
enough
you
are
right
on
the
way
home
they
did
not
speak
but
when
they
had
entered
their
room
madeleine
without
even
taking
off
her
veil
said
to
him
with
a
smile
i
have
a
surprise
for
you
he
growled
what
is
it
guess
i
can
not
make
the
effort
the
day
after
is
the
first
of
january
yes
it
is
the
season
for
new
year
gifts
yes
here
is
yours
which
laroche
handed
me
just
now
she
gave
him
a
small
black
box
which
resembled
a
he
opened
it
indifferently
and
saw
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
he
turned
a
trifle
pale
then
smiled
and
said
i
should
have
preferred
ten
millions
that
did
not
cost
him
much
she
had
expected
a
transport
of
delight
and
was
irritated
by
his
indifference
you
are
incomprehensible
nothing
seems
to
satisfy
you
he
replied
calmly
that
man
is
only
paying
his
debts
he
owes
me
a
great
deal
more
she
was
astonished
at
his
tone
and
said
it
is
very
nice
however
at
your
age
he
replied
i
should
have
much
more
he
took
the
casket
placed
it
on
the
mantelpiece
and
looked
for
some
minutes
at
the
brilliant
star
within
it
then
he
closed
it
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
and
began
to
prepare
to
retire
of
january
announced
that
prosper
georges
du
roy
had
been
decorated
with
the
legion
of
honor
for
exceptional
services
the
name
was
written
in
two
words
and
that
afforded
georges
more
pleasure
than
the
decoration
itself
an
hour
after
having
read
that
notice
he
received
a
note
from
mme
walter
inviting
him
to
come
and
bring
his
wife
to
dine
with
them
that
evening
to
celebrate
his
distinction
at
first
he
hesitated
then
throwing
the
letter
in
the
fire
he
said
to
madeleine
we
shall
dine
at
the
walters
this
evening
in
her
surprise
she
exclaimed
why
i
thought
you
would
never
set
your
foot
in
their
house
again
his
sole
reply
was
i
have
changed
my
mind
when
they
arrived
at
rue
du
faubourg
they
found
mme
walter
alone
in
the
dainty
boudoir
in
which
she
received
her
intimate
friends
she
was
dressed
in
black
and
her
hair
was
powdered
at
a
distance
she
appeared
like
an
old
lady
in
proximity
like
a
youthful
one
are
you
in
mourning
asked
madeleine
she
replied
sadly
yes
and
no
i
have
lost
none
of
my
relatives
but
i
have
arrived
at
an
age
when
one
should
wear
somber
colors
i
wear
it
to
inaugurate
it
hitherto
i
have
worn
it
in
my
heart
the
dinner
was
somewhat
tedious
suzanne
alone
talked
incessantly
rose
seemed
preoccupied
the
journalist
was
overwhelmed
with
congratulations
after
the
meal
when
all
repaired
to
the
mme
walter
detained
him
as
they
were
about
to
enter
the
salon
saying
i
will
never
speak
of
anything
to
you
again
only
come
to
see
me
georges
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
live
without
you
i
see
you
i
feel
you
in
my
heart
all
day
and
all
night
it
is
as
if
i
had
drunk
a
poison
which
preyed
upon
me
i
can
not
bear
it
i
would
rather
be
as
an
old
woman
to
you
i
powdered
my
hair
for
that
reason
but
come
here
come
from
time
to
time
as
a
friend
he
replied
calmly
very
well
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
of
it
again
you
see
i
came
on
receipt
of
your
letter
walter
who
had
preceded
them
with
his
two
daughters
and
madeleine
awaited
du
roy
near
the
picture
of
christ
walking
on
the
water
only
think
said
he
i
found
my
wife
yesterday
kneeling
before
that
painting
as
if
in
a
chapel
she
was
praying
mme
walter
replied
in
a
firm
voice
in
a
voice
in
which
vibrated
a
secret
exaltation
that
christ
will
save
my
soul
he
gives
me
fresh
courage
and
strength
every
time
that
i
look
at
him
and
pausing
before
the
picture
she
murmured
how
beautiful
he
is
how
frightened
those
men
are
and
how
they
love
him
look
at
his
head
his
eyes
how
simple
and
supernatural
he
is
at
the
same
time
suzanne
cried
why
he
looks
like
you
i
am
sure
he
looks
like
you
the
resemblance
is
striking
she
made
him
stand
beside
the
painting
and
everyone
recognized
the
likeness
du
roy
was
embarrassed
walter
thought
it
very
singular
madeleine
with
a
smile
remarked
that
jesus
looked
more
manly
mme
walter
stood
by
motionless
staring
fixedly
at
her
lover
face
her
cheeks
as
white
as
her
hair
chapter

divorce
during
the
remainder
of
the
winter
the
du
roys
often
visited
the
walters
georges
too
frequently
dined
there
alone
madeleine
pleading
fatigue
and
preferring
to
remain
at
home
he
had
chosen
friday
as
his
day
and
mme
walter
never
invited
anyone
else
on
that
evening
it
belonged
to
often
in
a
dark
corner
or
behind
a
tree
in
the
conservatory
mme
walter
embraced
the
young
man
and
whispered
in
his
ear
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
desperately
but
he
always
repulsed
her
coldly
saying
if
you
persist
in
that
i
will
not
come
again
toward
the
end
of
march
people
talked
of
the
marriage
of
the
two
sisters

to
marry
dame
rumor
said
count
de
and
suzanne
the
marquis
de
cazolles
the
subject
of
suzanne
possible
marriage
had
not
been
broached
again
between
her
and
georges
until
one
morning
the
latter
having
been
brought
home
by
walter
to
lunch
he
whispered
to
suzanne
come
let
us
give
the
fish
some
bread
they
proceeded
to
the
conservatory
in
which
was
the
marble
basin
containing
the
fish
as
georges
and
suzanne
leaned
over
its
edge
they
saw
their
reflections
in
the
water
and
smiled
at
them
suddenly
he
said
in
a
low
voice
it
is
not
right
of
you
to
keep
secrets
from
me
suzanne
she
asked
what
secrets
do
you
remember
what
you
promised
me
here
the
night
of
the
fete
no
to
consult
me
every
time
you
received
a
proposal
well
well
you
have
received
one
from
whom
you
know
very
well
no
i
swear
i
do
not
yes
you
do
it
is
from
that
fop
of
a
marquis
de
cazolles
he
is
not
a
fop
that
may
be
but
he
is
stupid
he
is
no
match
for
you
who
are
so
pretty
so
fresh
so
bright
she
asked
with
a
smile
what
have
you
against
him
i
nothing
yes
you
have
he
is
not
all
that
you
say
he
is
he
is
a
fool
and
an
intriguer
she
glanced
at
him
what
ails
you
he
spoke
as
if
tearing
a
secret
from
the
depths
of
his
heart
i
am
i
am
jealous
of
him
she
was
astonished
you
yes
i
why
because
i
love
you
and
you
know
it
then
she
said
severely
you
are
mad
he
replied
i
know
that
i
am
should
i
confess
it
i
a
married
man
to
you
a
young
girl
i
am
worse
than
mad
i
am
culpable
wretched
i
have
no
possible
hope
and
that
thought
almost
destroys
my
reason
when
i
hear
that
you
are
going
to
be
married
i
feel
murder
in
my
heart
you
must
forgive
me
suzanne
he
paused
the
young
girl
murmured
half
sadly
half
gaily
it
is
a
pity
that
you
are
married
but
what
can
you
do
it
can
not
be
helped
he
turned
toward
her
abruptly
and
said
if
i
were
free
would
you
marry
me
she
replied
yes
i
would
marry
you
because
i
love
you
better
than
any
of
the
others
he
rose
and
stammering
thanks
thanks

i
implore

a
while

somewhat
confused
and
without
comprehending
what
he
asked
she
whispered
i
promise
du
roy
threw
a
large
piece
of
bread
into
the
water
and
fled
without
saying
adieu
as
if
he
were
beside
himself
suzanne
in
surprise
returned
to
the
salon
when
du
roy
arrived
home
he
asked
madeleine
who

she
hesitated
no
i
am
not

i
prefer

remain
here
as

like
no
one
will
force
you
then
he
took
up
his
hat
and
went
out
for
some
time
he
had
watched
and
followed
her
knowing
all
her
actions
the
time
he
had
awaited

come
at
length

dressed
early
in
order
as
he
said
to
make
several
calls
before
going
to
walter
at
about
six
after
having
kissed
his
wife
he
went
in
search
of
a
cab
he
said
to
the
cabman

restaurant

slowly
on

lowered
the
shades
when
in
front
of
his
house
he
kept
watch
of
it
after
waiting
ten
minutes
he
saw
madeleine
come
out
and
go
toward
the
boulevards
when
she
was
out
of
earshot
he
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
and
cried

cab
proceeded
on
its
way
and
stopped
at
the
georges

ate
slowly
looking
at
his
watch
from
time
to
time
at

drove
to
rue
la
rochefoucauld
he
mounted
to
the
third
story
of
a
house
in
that
street
and
asked
the
maid

opened
the
door

guibert
de
lorme
at

he
was
shown
into
the
and
after
waiting
some
time
a
tall
man
with
a
military
bearing
and
gray
hair
entered
he
was
the
police
commissioner
du
roy
bowed
then
said
as
i
suspected

her
lover
in

apartments
they

rented
on
rue
des
martyrs
the
magistrate
bowed
i

very
well
i
have
a
cab
below
and
with
three
other
officers
they
proceeded
to
the
house
in
which
du
roy
expected
to
surprise
his
wife
one
officer
remained
at
the
door
to
watch
the
exit
on
the
second
floor
they
halted
du
roy
rang
the
bell
and
they
waited
in
two
or
three
minutes
georges
rang
again
several
times
in
succession
they
heard
a
light
step
approach
and
a
woman
voice
evidently
disguised
asked
who
is
there
the
police
officer
replied
open
in
the
name
of
the
law
the
voice
repeated
who
are
you
i
am
the
police
commissioner
open
or
i
will
force
the
door
the
voice
continued
what
do
you
want
du
roy
interrupted
it
is
i
it
is
useless
to
try
to
escape
us
the
footsteps
receded
and
then
returned
georges
said
if
you
do
not
open
we
will
force
the
door
receiving
no
reply
he
shook
the
door
so
violently
that
the
old
lock
gave
way
and
the
young
man
almost
fell
over
madeleine
who
was
standing
in
the
antechamber
in
her
petticoat
her
hair
loosened
her
feet
bare
and
a
candle
in
her
hand
he
exclaimed
it
is
she
we
have
caught
them
and
he
rushed
into
the
room
the
commissioner
turned
to
madeleine
who
had
followed
them
through
the
rooms
in
one
of
which
were
the
remnants
of
a
supper
and
looking
into
her
eyes
said
you
are
mme
claire
madeleine
du
roy
lawful
wife
of
prosper
georges
du
roy
here
present
she
replied
yes
sir
what
are
you
doing
here
she
made
no
reply
the
officer
repeated
his
question
still
she
did
not
reply
he
waited
several
moments
and
then
said
if
you
do
not
confess
madame
i
shall
be
forced
to
inquire
into
the
matter
they
could
see
a
man
form
concealed
beneath
the
covers
of
the
bed
du
roy
advanced
softly
and
uncovered
the
livid
face
of
the
officer
again
asked
who
are
you
as
the
man
did
not
reply
he
continued
i
am
the
police
commissioner
and
i
call
upon
you
to
tell
me
your
name
if
you
do
not
answer
i
shall
be
forced
to
arrest
you
in
any
case
rise
i
will
interrogate
you
when
you
are
dressed
in
the
meantime
madeleine
had
regained
her
composure
and
seeing
that
all
was
lost
she
was
determined
to
put
a
brave
face
upon
the
matter
her
eyes
sparkled
with
the
audacity
of
bravado
and
taking
a
piece
of
paper
she
lighted
the
ten
candles
in
the
candelabra
as
if
for
a
reception
that
done
she
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
took
a
cigarette
out
of
a
case
and
began
to
smoke
seeming
not
to
see
her
husband
in
the
meantime
the
man
in
the
bed
had
dressed
himself
and
advanced
the
officer
turned
to
him
now
sir
will
you
tell
me
who
you
are
he
made
no
reply
i
see
i
shall
have
to
arrest
you
then
the
man
cried
do
not
touch
me
i
am
inviolable
du
roy
rushed
toward
him
exclaiming
i
can
have
you
arrested
if
i
want
to
then
he
added
this
man
name
is
minister
of
foreign
affairs
the
officer
retreated
and
stammered
sir
will
you
tell
me
who
you
are
for
once
that
miserable
fellow
has
not
lied
i
am
indeed
minister
and
pointing
to
georges
breast
he
added
and
that
scoundrel
wears
upon
his
coat
the
cross
of
honor
which
i
gave
him
du
roy
turned
pale
with
a
rapid
gesture
he
tore
the
decoration
from
his
buttonhole
and
throwing
it
in
the
fire
exclaimed
that
is
what
a
decoration
is
worth
which
is
given
by
a
scoundrel
of
your
order
the
commissioner
stepped
between
them
as
they
stood
face
to
face
saying
gentlemen
you
forget
yourselves
and
your
dignity
madeleine
smoked
on
calmly
a
smile
hovering
about
her
lips
the
officer
continued
sir
i
have
surprised
you
alone
with
mme
du
roy
under
suspicious
circumstances
what
have
you
to
say
nothing
do
your
duty
the
commissioner
turned
to
madeleine
do
you
confess
madame
that
this
gentleman
is
your
lover
she
replied
boldly
i
do
not
deny
it
that
is
sufficient
the
magistrate
made
several
notes
when
he
had
finished
writing
the
minister
who
stood
ready
coat
upon
arm
hat
in
hand
asked
do
you
need
me
any
longer
sir

go
du
roy
addressed
him
with
an
insolent
smile
why
should
you
go
we
have
finished
we
will
leave
you
alone
together
then
taking
the
officer
arm
he
said
let
us
go

have
nothing
more
to
do
in
this
place
an
hour
later
georges
du
roy
entered
the
office
of
la
vie
francaise
walter
was
there
he
raised
his
head
and
asked
what
are
you
here
why
are
you
not
dining
at
my
house
where

you
come
from
georges
replied
with
emphasis

minister
of
foreign
affairs
what
i
found
him
alone
with
my
wife
in

apartments
the
commissioner
of

my
witness

your
object
to
overthrow
that
wretch
that
public
malefactor
georges
placed
his
hat
upon
a
chair
and
added
woe
to
those
whom

georges

i

item

prudently
the
old
man
hesitated
then
said

so
it
serves
those
right
who
are
caught
in
such
scrapes
chapter
xvii
the
final
plot
three
months
had
elapsed
georges
du
roy
divorce
had
been
obtained
his
wife
had
resumed
the
name
of
forestier
as
the
walters
were
going
to
trouville
on
the
fifteenth
of
july
they
decided
to
spend
a
day
in
the
country
before
starting
the
day
chosen
was
thursday
and
they
set
out
at
nine
in
the
morning
in
a
large
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
they
were
going
to
lunch
at
had
requested
that
he
might
be
the
only
young
man
in
the
party
for
he
could
not
bear
the
presence
of
the
marquis
de
cazolles
at
the
last
moment
however
it
was
decided
that
count
de
should
go
for
he
and
rose
had
been
betrothed
a
month
the
day
was
delightful
georges
who
was
very
pale
gazed
at
suzanne
as
they
sat
in
the
carriage
and
their
eyes
met
mme
walter
was
contented
and
happy
the
luncheon
was
a
long
and
merry
one
before
leaving
for
paris
du
roy
proposed
a
walk
on
the
terrace
they
stopped
on
the
way
to
admire
the
view
as
they
passed
on
georges
and
suzanne
lingered
behind
the
former
whispered
softly
suzanne
i
love
you
madly
she
whispered
in
return
i
love
you
too
he
continued
if
i
can
not
have
you
for
my
wife
i
shall
leave
the
country
she
replied
ask
papa
perhaps
he
will
consent
he
answered
impatiently
no
i
repeat
that
it
is
useless
the
door
of
the
house
would
be
closed
against
me
i
would
lose
my
position
on
the
journal
and
we
would
not
even
meet
those
are
the
consequences
a
formal
proposal
would
produce
they
have
promised
you
to
the
marquis
de
cazolles
they
hope
you
will
finally
say
and
they
are
waiting
what
can
we
do
have
you
the
courage
to
brave
your
father
and
mother
for
my
sake
yes
truly
yes
well
there
is
only
one
way
it
must
come
from
you
and
not
from
me
you
are
an
indulged
child
they
let
you
say
anything
and
are
not
surprised
at
any
audacity
on
your
part
listen
then
this
evening
on
returning
home
go
to
your
mother
first
and
tell
her
that
you
want
to
marry
me
she
will
be
very
much
agitated
and
very
angry
suzanne
interrupted
him
oh
mamma
would
be
glad
he
replied
quickly
no
no
you
do
not
know
her
she
will
be
more
vexed
than
your
father
but
you
must
insist
you
must
not
yield
you
must
repeat
that
you
will
marry
me
and
me
alone
will
you
do
so
i
will
and
on
leaving
your
mother
repeat
the
same
thing
to
your
father
very
decidedly
well
and
then
and
then
matters
will
reach
a
climax
if
you
are
determined
to
be
my
wife
my
dear
dear
little
suzanne
i
will
elope
with
you
she
clapped
her
hands
as
all
the
charming
adventures
in
the
romances
she
had
read
occurred
to
her
and
cried
oh
what
bliss
when
will
you
elope
with
me
he
whispered
very
low
where
shall
we
go
that
is
my
secret
think
well
of
what
you
are
doing
remember
that
after
that
flight
you
must
become
my
wife
it
is
the
only
means
but
it
is
dangerous
very
dangerous
for
you
i
have
decided
where
shall
i
meet
you
meet
me
about
midnight
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
i
will
be
there
he
clasped
her
hand
oh
how
i
love
you
how
brave
and
good
you
are
then
you
do
not
want
to
marry
marquis
de
cazolles
oh
no
mme
walter
turning
her
head
called
out
come
little
one
what
are
you
and
doing
they
rejoined
the
others
and
returned
by
way
of
chatou
when
the
carriage
arrived
at
the
door
of
the
mansion
mme
walter
pressed
georges
to
dine
with
them
but
he
refused
and
returned
home
to
look
over
his
papers
and
destroy
any
compromising
letters
then
he
repaired
in
a
cab
with
feverish
haste
to
the
place
of
meeting
he
waited
there
some
time
and
thinking
his
ladylove
had
played
him
false
he
was
about
to
drive
off
when
a
gentle
voice
whispered
at
the
door
of
his
cab
are
you
there
is
it
you
suzanne
yes
ah
get
in
she
entered
the
cab
and
he
bade
the
cabman
drive
on
he
asked
well
how
did
it
all
pass
off
she
murmured
faintly
oh
it
was
terrible
with
mamma
especially
your
mamma
what
did
she
say
tell
me
oh
it
was
frightful
i
entered
her
room
and
made
the
little
speech
i
had
prepared
she
turned
pale
and
cried
i
wept
i
protested
that
i
would
marry
only
you
she
was
like
a
mad
woman
she
vowed
i
should
be
sent
to
a
convent
i
never
saw
her
like
that
never
papa
hearing
her
agitated
words
entered
he
was
not
as
angry
as
she
was
but
he
said
you
were
not
a
suitable
match
for
me
as
they
had
vexed
me
i
talked
louder
than
they
and
papa
with
a
dramatic
air
bade
me
leave
the
room
that
decided
me
to
fly
with
you
and
here
i
am
where
shall
we
go
he
replied
encircling
her
waist
with
his
arm
it
is
too
late
to
take
the
train
this
cab
will
take
us
to
sevres
where
we
can
spend
the
night
and
we
will
leave
for
la
it
is
a
pretty
village
on
the
banks
of
the
seine
between
mantes
and
bonnieres
the
cab
rolled
on
georges
took
the
young
girl
hand
and
kissed
it
respectfully
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
her
being
unaccustomed
to
platonic
affection
suddenly
he
perceived
that
she
was
weeping
he
asked
in
affright
what
ails
you
my
dear
little
one
she
replied
tearfully
i
was
thinking
that
poor
mamma
could
not
sleep
if
she
had
found
out
that
i
was
gone
her
mother
indeed
was
not
asleep
when
suzanne
left
the
room
mine
walter
turned
to
her
husband
and
asked
in
despair
what
does
that
mean
it
means
that
that
intriguer
has
influenced
her
it
is
he
who
has
made
her
refuse
cazolles
you
have
flattered
and
cajoled
him
too
it
was
here
there
from
morning
until
night
now
you
are
paid
for
it
i
yes
you
you
are
as
much
infatuated
with
him
as
madeleine
suzanne
and
the
rest
of
them
do
you
think
that
i
did
not
see
that
you
could
not
exist
for
two
days
without
him
she
rose
tragically
i
will
not
allow
you
to
speak
to
me
thus
you
forget
that
i
was
not
brought
up
like
you
in
a
shop
with
an
oath
he
left
the
room
banging
the
door
behind
him
when
he
was
gone
she
thought
over
all
that
had
taken
place
suzanne
was
in
love
with
and
wanted
to
marry
suzanne
no
it
was
not
true
she
was
mistaken
he
would
not
be
capable
of
such
an
action
he
knew
nothing
of
suzanne
escapade
they
would
take
suzanne
away
for
six
months
and
that
would
end
it
she
rose
saying
i
can
not
rest
in
this
uncertainty
i
shall
lose
my
reason
i
will
arouse
suzanne
and
question
her
she
proceeded
to
her
daughter
room
she
entered
it
was
empty
the
bed
had
not
been
slept
in
a
horrible
suspicion
possessed
her
and
she
flew
to
her
husband
he
was
in
bed
reading
she
gasped
have
you
seen
suzanne
no
why
she
is
gone
she
is
not
in
her
room
with
one
bound
he
was
out
of
bed
he
rushed
to
his
daughter
room
not
finding
her
there
he
sank
into
a
chair
his
wife
had
followed
him
well
she
asked
he
had
not
the
strength
to
reply
he
was
no
longer
angry
he
groaned
he
has
her
we
are
lost
lost
how
why
he
must
marry
her
now
she
cried
wildly
marry
her
never
are
you
mad
he
replied
sadly
it
will
do
no
good
to
yell
he
has
disgraced
her
the
best
thing
to
be
done
is
to
give
her
to
him
and
at
once
too
then
no
one
will
know
of
this
escapade
she
repeated
in
great
agitation
never
he
shall
never
have
suzanne
overcome
walter
murmured
but
he
has
her
and
he
will
keep
her
as
long
as
we
do
not
yield
therefore
to
avoid
a
scandal
we
must
do
so
at
once
but
his
wife
replied
no
no
i
will
never
consent
impatiently
he
returned
it
is
a
matter
of
necessity
ah
the
scoundrel
how
he
has
deceived
us
but
he
is
shrewd
at
any
rate
she
might
have
done
better
as
far
as
position
but
not
intelligence
and
future
is
concerned
he
is
a
promising
young
man
he
will
be
a
deputy
or
a
minister
some
day
mme
walter
however
repeated
wildly
i
will
never
let
him
marry
suzanne
do
you
hear
never
in
his
turn
he
became
incensed
and
like
a
practical
man
defended
be
silent
i
tell
you
he
must
marry
her
and
who
knows
perhaps
we
shall
not
regret
it
with
men
of
his
stamp
one
never
knows
what
may
come
about
you
saw
how
he
downed
in
three
articles
and
that
with
a
dignity
which
was
very
difficult
to
maintain
in
his
position
as
husband
so
we
shall
see
mme
walter
felt
a
desire
to
cry
aloud
and
tear
her
hair
but
she
only
repeated
angrily
he
shall
not
have
her
walter
rose
took
up
his
lamp
and
said
you
are
silly
like
all
women
you
only
act
on
impulse
you
do
not
know
how
to
accommodate
yourself
to
circumstances
you
are
stupid
i
tell
you
he
shall
marry
her
it
is
essential
and
he
left
the
room
mme
walter
remained
alone
with
her
suffering
her
despair
if
only
a
priest
were
at
hand
she
would
cast
herself
at
his
feet
and
confess
all
her
errors
and
her
agony
he
would
prevent
the
marriage
where
could
she
find
a
priest
where
should
she
turn
before
her
eyes
floated
like
a
vision
the
calm
face
of
christ
walking
on
the
water
as
she
had
seen
it
in
the
painting
he
seemed
to
say
to
her
come
unto
me
kneel
at
my
feet
i
will
comfort
and
instruct
you
as
to
what
to
do
she
took
the
lamp
and
sought
the
conservatory
she
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
room
which
held
the
enormous
canvas
and
fell
upon
her
knees
before
it
at
first
she
prayed
fervently
but
as
she
raised
her
eyes
and
saw
the
resemblance
to
she
murmured
jesus
jesus
while
her
thoughts
were
with
her
daughter
and
her
lover
she
uttered
a
wild
cry
as
she
pictured
them
together
alone
and
fell
into
a
swoon
when
day
broke
they
found
mme
walter
still
lying
unconscious
before
the
painting
she
was
so
ill
after
that
that
her
life
was
almost
despaired
of
walter
explained
his
daughter
absence
to
the
servants
by
saying
to
them
that
she
had
been
sent
to
a
convent
for
a
short
time
then
he
replied
to
a
long
letter
from
du
roy
giving
his
consent
to
his
marriage
with
his
daughter
had
posted
that
epistle
when
he
left
paris
having
prepared
it
the
night
of
his
departure
in
it
he
said
in
respectful
terms
that
he
had
loved
the
young
girl
a
long
time
that
there
had
never
been
any
understanding
between
them
but
that
as
she
came
to
him
to
say
i
will
be
your
wife
he
felt
authorized
in
keeping
her
in
hiding
her
in
fact
until
he
had
obtained
a
reply
from
her
parents
whose
wishes
were
to
him
of
more
value
than
those
of
his
betrothed
georges
and
suzanne
spent
a
week
at
la
never
had
the
young
girl
enjoyed
herself
so
thoroughly
as
she
passed
for
his
sister
they
lived
in
a
chaste
and
free
intimacy
a
kind
of
living
companionship
he
thought
it
wiser
to
treat
her
with
respect
and
when
he
said
to
her
we
will
return
to
paris
your
father
has
bestowed
your
hand
upon
me
she
whispered
naively
already
this
is
just
as
pleasant
as
being
your
wife

it
was
dark
in
the
apartments

raise
the
shades
the

said

replied
in
the
affirmative

angrily

said
with
dignity

of
you

be
more
careful
as
to
what

such
words
from
him

handle
you
with
gloves

make

first

a
portion
of
vaudrec
bequest

he
seized
her
by
her
shoulders
and
shook
her

of
that
i
forbid
you

he
would
have
taken
anything

lie
exasperated
him
he
repeated

he
shook
her
as
he
would
have
shaken
the
bough
of
a
tree
still
she
continued

her
ruin
i
know
it
he
rushed
upon
her
and
struck
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
man
suddenly
she
ceased
speaking
and
groaned
beneath
his
blows
finally
he
desisted

room
several
times
in
order
to
regain
his
entered
the
bedroom
filled
the
basin
with
cold
water
and
bathed

then
he

hands
and
returned
to
see
what
clotilde
was
doing
she
had
not
moved
she
lay
upon
the
floor
weeping
softly
he
asked
harshly
will
you
soon
have
done
crying
she
did
not
reply
he
stood
in
the
center
of
the
room
somewhat
embarrassed
somewhat
ashamed
as
he
saw
the
form
lying
before
him
suddenly
he
seized
his
hat
good
evening
you
can
leave
the
key
with
the
janitor
when
you
are
ready
i
will
not
await

he
left

room
closed
the
door
sought
the
porter
and
said
to
him

will
go
out

tell
the
proprietor
that
i
have
given
notice
for

was
fixed
for
the
twentieth
it
was
to
take
place
at
the
madeleine
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
gossip
about
the
entire
affair
and
many
different
reports
were
circulated
mme
walter
had
aged
greatly
her
hair
was
gray
and
she
sought
solace
in
religion
in
the
early
part
of
september
la
vie
francaise
announced
that
baron
du
roy
de
cantel
had
become
its
chief
editor
walter
reserving
the
title
of
manager
to
that
announcement
were
subjoined
the
names
of
the
staff
of
art
and
theatrical
critics
political
reporters
and
so
forth
journalists
no
longer
sneered
in
speaking
of
la
vie
francaise
its
success
had
been
rapid
and
complete
the
marriage
of
its
chief
editor
was
what
was
called
a
parisian
event
georges
du
roy
and
the
walters
having
occasioned
much
comment
for
some
time
the
ceremony
took
place
on
a
clear
autumn
day
at
ten
the
curious
began
to
assemble
at
eleven
detachments
of
officers
came
to
disperse
the
crowd
soon
after
the
first
guests
arrived
they
were
followed
by
others
women
in
rich
costumes
men
grave
and
dignified
the
church
slowly
began
to
fill
norbert
de
varenne
espied
jacques
rival
and
joined
him
well
said
he
sharpers
always
succeed
his
companion
who
was
not
envious
replied
so
much
the
better
for
him
his
fortune
is
made
rival
asked
do
you
know
what
has
become
of
his
wife
the
poet
smiled
yes
and
no
she
lives
a
very
retired
life
i
have
been
told
in
the
montmartre
quarter
but
there
is
a
but
for
some
time
i
have
read
political
articles
in
plume
which
resemble
those
of
forestier
and
du
roy
they
are
supposed
to
be
written
by
a
jean
le
dol
a
young
intelligent
handsome
man
something
like
our
friend
georges
who
has
become
acquainted
with
mme
forestier
from
that
i
have
concluded
that
she
likes
beginners
and
that
they
like
her
she
is
moreover
rich
vaudrec
and
were
not
attentive
to
her
for
nothing
rival
asked
tell
me
is
it
true
that
mme
walter
and
du
roy
do
not
speak
yes
she
did
not
wish
to
give
him
her
daughter
hand
but
he
threatened
the
old
man
with
shocking
revelations
walter
remembered
fate
and
yielded
at
once
but
his
wife
obstinate
like
all
women
vowed
that
she
would
never
address
a
word
to
her
it
is
comical
to
see
them
together
she
looks
like
the
statue
of
vengeance
and
he
is
very
uncomfortable
although
he
tries
to
appear
at
his
ease
suddenly
the
beadle
struck
the
floor
three
times
with
his
staff
all
the
people
turned
to
see
what
was
coming
and
the
young
bride
appeared
in
the
doorway
leaning
upon
her
father
arm
she
looked
like
a
beautiful
doll
crowned
with
a
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
she
advanced
with
bowed
head
the
ladies
smiled
and
murmured
as
she
passed
them
the
men
whispered
exquisite
adorable
walter
walked
by
her
side
with
exaggerated
dignity
behind
them
came
four
maids
of
honor
dressed
in
pink
and
forming
a
charming
court
for
so
dainty
a
queen
mme
walter
followed
on
the
arm
of
count
de
aged
father
she
did
not
walk
she
dragged
herself
along
ready
to
faint
at
every
step
she
had
aged
and
grown
thinner
next
came
georges
du
roy
with
an
old
lady
a
stranger
he
held
his
head
proudly
erect
and
wore
upon
his
coat
like
a
drop
of
blood
the
red
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
he
was
followed
by
the
relatives
rose
who
had
been
married
six
weeks
with
a
senator
count
de
with
viscountess
de
percemur
following
them
was
a
motley
procession
of
associates
and
friends
of
du
roy
country
cousins
of
mme
walter
and
guests
invited
by
her
husband
the
tones
of
the
organ
filled
the
church
the
large
doors
at
the
entrance
were
closed
and
georges
kneeled
beside
his
bride
in
the
choir
the
new
bishop
of
tangiers
cross
in
hand
miter
on
head
entered
from
the
sacristy
to
unite
them
in
the
name
of
the
almighty
he
asked
the
usual
questions
rings
were
exchanged
words
pronounced
which
bound
them
forever
and
then
he
delivered
an
address
to
the
newly
married
couple
the
sound
of
stifled
sobs
caused
several
to
turn
their
heads
mme
walter
was
weeping
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
she
had
been
obliged
to
yield
but
since
the
day
on
which
she
had
told
du
roy
you
are
the
vilest
man
i
know
never
speak
to
me
again
for
i
will
not
answer
you
she
had
suffered
intolerable
anguish
she
hated
suzanne
bitterly
her
hatred
was
caused
by
unnatural
jealousy
the
bishop
was
marrying
a
daughter
to
her
mother
lover
before
her
and
two
thousand
persons
and
she
could
say
nothing
she
could
not
stop
him
she
could
not
cry
he
is
mine
that
man
is
my
lover
that
union
you
are
blessing
is
infamous
several
ladies
touched
by
her
apparent
grief
murmured
how
affected
that
poor
mother
is
the
bishop
said
you
are
among
the
favored
ones
of
the
earth
you
sir
who
are
raised
above
others
by
your
talent
you
who
write
instruct
counsel
guide
the
people
have
a
grand
mission
to
fulfill
a
fine
example
to
set
du
roy
listened
to
him
proudly
a
prelate
of
the
roman
church
spoke
thus
to
him
a
number
of
illustrious
people
had
come
thither
on
his
account
it
seemed
to
him
that
an
invisible
power
was
impelling
him
on
he
would
become
one
of
the
masters
of
the
country
he
the
son
of
the
poor
peasants
of
canteleu
he
had
given
his
parents
five
thousand
francs
of
count
de
vaudrec
fortune
and
he
intended
sending
them
fifty
thousand
more
then
they
could
buy
a
small
estate
and
live
happily
the
bishop
had
finished
his
harangue
a
priest
ascended
the
altar
and
the
organ
pealed
forth
suddenly
the
vibrating
tones
melted
into
delicate
melodious
ones
like
the
songs
of
birds
then
again
they
swelled
into
deep
full
tones
and
human
voices
chanted
over
their
bowed
heads
vauri
and
landeck
of
the
opera
were
singing
kneeling
beside
suzanne
bowed
his
head
at
that
moment
he
felt
almost
pious
for
he
was
filled
with
gratitude
for
the
blessings
showered
upon
him
without
knowing
just
whom
he
was
addressing
he
offered
up
thanks
for
his
success
when
the
ceremony
was
over
he
rose
and
giving
his
arm
to
his
wife
they
passed
into
the
sacristy
a
stream
of
people
entered
georges
fancied
himself
a
king
whom
the
people
were
coming
to
greet
he
shook
hands
uttered
words
which
signified
nothing
and
replied
to
congratulations
with
the
words
you
are
very
kind
suddenly
he
saw
mme
de
marelle
and
the
recollection
of
all
the
kisses
he
had
given
her
and
which
she
had
returned
of
all
their
caresses
of
the
sound
of
her
voice
possessed
him
with
the
mad
desire
to
regain
her
she
was
so
pretty
with
her
bright
eyes
and
roguish
air
she
advanced
somewhat
timidly
and
offered
him
her
hand
he
took
retained
and
pressed
it
as
if
to
say
i
shall
love
you
always
i
am
yours
their
eyes
met
smiling
bright
full
of
love
she
murmured
in
her
soft
tones
until
we
meet
again
sir
and
he
gaily
repeated
her
words
others
approached
and
she
passed
on
finally
the
throng
dispersed
georges
placed
suzanne
hand
upon
his
arm
to
pass
through
the
church
with
her
it
was
filled
with
people
for
all
had
resumed
their
seats
in
order
to
see
them
leave
the
sacred
edifice
together
he
walked
along
slowly
with
a
firm
step
his
head
erect
he
saw
no
one
he
only
thought
of
himself
when
they
reached
the
threshold
he
saw
a
crowd
gathered
outside
come
to
gaze
at
him
georges
du
roy
the
people
of
paris
envied
him
raising
his
eyes
he
saw
beyond
the
place
de
la
concorde
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
only
a
stone
throw
from
the
portico
of
the
madeleine
to
that
of
the
palais
bourbon
leisurely
they
descended
the
steps
between
two
rows
of
spectators
but
georges
did
not
see

his
thoughts
had
returned
to
the
past
and

the
curly

upon
her
temples
before
the
mirror
in
their
apartments
