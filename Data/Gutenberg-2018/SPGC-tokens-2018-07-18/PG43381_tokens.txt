french
preface
from
thirty
to

years
ago
appeared
the
greater
number
of
the
english
translations
of
the
icelandic
sagas
since
then
the
reading
of
these
heroic
tales
has
so
completely
gone
out
of
style
that
their
names
are
rarely
mentioned
in
schools
or
even
colleges
what
boy
feels
his
blood
stir
at
the
mention
of
grettir
how
many
lovers
of
good
reading
know
that
the
most
human
of
all
epics
lie
untouched
on
the
shelves
of
the
public
libraries
the
wisdom
of
njal
the
chivalry
of
gunnar
the
villainy
of
mord
the
manhood
of
kari
the
savagery
of
the
craft
of
snorri
and
the
fine
qualities
of
biarni
of
biorn
of
skarphedinn
of
illugi
of
kolskegg
of
hrut
of
blundketil
all
these
are
forgotten
in
the
curious
turn
of
taste
which
has
made
the
stories
of
a
wonderful
people
almost
a
lost
literature
for
the
icelanders
were
a
wonderful
people
to
escape
the
tyranny
of
kings
they
settled
a
new
land
and
there
built
up
the
laws
and
customs
in
which
we
see
the
promise
of
modern
civilization
few
early
peoples
had
such
a
body
of
laws
few
developed
such
manhood
no
better
pictures
of
a
rural
and
yet
valiant
race
have
ever
been
made
than
in
the
tales
which
the
icelanders
had
the
skill
to
weave
about
their
heroes
those
men
who
at
home
in
their
island
or
so
far
abroad
as
constantinople
made
the
name
of
icelander
respected
we
read
of
these
men
and
this
people
in
stories
which
somewhat
too
old
for
boys
and
girls
reveal
the
laws
customs
habits
of
a
thousand
years
ago
the
njal
saga
the
grettir
saga
the
saga
and
the
gisli
saga
are
perhaps
the
greatest
of
those
which
have
been
translated
they
are
reinforced
by
such
shorter
pieces
as
hen
thorir
saga
and
the
stories
of
the
banded
men
the
hraffnkell
frey
priest
and
howard
the
halt
the
spirit
of
those
days
is
particularly
well
given
in
that
wonderful
fragment
of
thorstein
staffsmitten
which
not
being
part
of
any
complete
saga
has
been
drawn
upon
for
the
closing
incidents
of
the
present
story
many
other
such
incidents
are
preserved
a
reference
to
one
of
which
in
a
footnote
to
i
think
the
saga
gave
the
suggestion
for
the
main
plot
of
this
book
at
the
same
time
in
contemporary
writings
we
may
read
of
the
life
of
other
divisions
of
the
scandinavian
race
the
story
nearest
to
this
book
is
the
orkneyingers
saga
the
main
interest
of
all
these
tales
is
the
same
they
tell
of
real
men
and
women
in
real
circumstances
and
show
them
human
in
spite
of
the
legends
which
have
grown
about
them
the
sagas
reveal
the
characteristics
of
our
branch
of
the
aryan
race
especially
the
personal
courage
which
is
so
superior
to
that
of
the
greek
and
latin
races
and
which
makes
the
teutonic
epics
whether
the
niebelungen
lied
the
morte
darthur
or
the
njala
much
more
inspiring
than
the
iliad
the
odyssey
or
the
aeneid
the
prominence
of
law
in
almost
every
one
of
the
icelandic
sagas
has
been
preserved
in
the
following
story
and
the
conditions
of
life
whether
at
home
or
abroad
have
been

chapter
i
of
the
lighting
of
the
beacon
in
the
time
after
iceland
had
become
christian
and
after
the
burning
of
njal
but
before
the
deaths
of
snorri
the
priest
and
grettir
the
outlaw
there
lived
at
cragness
above
broadfirth
a
man
named
hiarandi
called
the
unlucky
and
well
was
he
so
named
for
he
got
a
poor
inheritance
from
his
father
but
he
left
a
poorer
to
his
son
now
the
farm
of
cragness
was
a
fertile
fell
standing
above
the
land
round
about
and
girt
with
crags
below
lay
broadfirth
great
and
wide
and
cragness
jutted
out
into
it
a
danger
to
ships
it
had
no
harbor
but
a
little
cove
among
the
rocks
where
hiarandi
kept
his
boat
and
many
ships
were
wrecked
on
the
headland
bringing
fortune
to
the
owners
of
cragness
both
in
goods
and
firewood
and
all
the
land
about
once
belonged
to
the
farm
rich
therefore
would
have
been
the
dwellers
at
cragness
but
for
the
doings
of
hiarandi
father
he
would
always
be
striving
at
the
law
and
he
was
of
ill
judgment
or
ill
luck
for
what
he
gained
at
the
farm
he
always
lost
the
older
he
grew
the
more
quarrelsome
he
became
and
judgments
heaped
heavy
on
him
until
at
last
he
was
so
hard
put
that
he
must
sell
all
his
outlying
lands
so
the
farm
from
a
wide
estate
became
only
the
land
of
cragness
itself
and
another
holding
of
a
few
acres
lying
inland
on
the
uplands
within
sight
of
cragness
and
the
sea
in
the
time
when
hiarandi
was
young
iceland
was
still
heathen
he
sought
his
fortune
in
a
trading
voyage
and
sailed
trading
in
the
south
isles
as
a
chapman
trafficking
in
goods
of
all
kinds
and
he
made
money
there
so
that
at
last
when
he
sailed
again
for
home
he
counted
on
a
fair
future
but
the
ship
was
wrecked
in
a
storm
and
few
of
the
men
came
ashore
and
hiarandi
himself
was
saved
by
means
of
a
maid
who
dwelt
at
the
place
who
dragged
him
from
the
surf
so
hiarandi
came
home
on
foot
his
clothes
in
tatters
having
lost
money
rather
than
gained
it
then
his
father
whose
losses
pressed
heavy
on
him
struggled
no
more
with
the
world
but
went
to
his
bed
and
died
and
in
that
summer
when
all
iceland
took
to
the
new
faith
hiarandi
became
master
at
cragness
hiarandi
was
a
silent
man
not
neighborly
but
an
unworldly
choice
he
made
of
a
wife
for
he
took
that
woman
who
had
saved
him
from
the
waves
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
small
farmer
and
brought
neither
dowry
nor
kinship
of
any
power
so
men
said
that
hiarandi
had
no
wish
to
rise
in
the
world
he
lived
upon
his
farm
with
two
thralls
and
a
bondservant
and
husbanding
his
goods
well
by
little
and
little
he
made
money
which
he
put
out
at
call
and
so
bade
fair
to
do
better
than
his
father
for
all
his
poor
start
in
life
and
a
loving
spouse
he
had
in
asdis
his
wife
who
one
day
bore
him
a
son
they
named
the
lad
rolf
and
he
grew
to
be
well
knit
he
was
not
powerful
but
straight
and
supple
and
of
great
craft
in
his
hands
and
from
delight
in
the
boy
hiarandi
changed
his
ways
and
became
more
gay
going
to
fairs
and
meetings
for
the
sake
of
rolf
and
hiarandi
taught
the
lad
all
he
knew
of
which
was
not
a
little
the
lad
was
swift
of
foot
he
was
skilled
in
the
use
of
the
sword
and
javelin
but
most
he
delighted
in
the
use
of
the
bow
and
that
was
natural
for
upon
the
cliffs
lived
in
thousands
hard
to
catch
the
boy
went
down
to
their
nests
with
ropes
and
took
eggs
in
their
season
or
the
young
before
they
could
fly
and
both
for
food
so
skilled
was
he
in
this
that
he
was
called
craggeir
the
cragsman
and
no
man
could
surpass
him
whether
in
daring
or
skill
but
there
were
times
when
there
were
no
eggs
nor
fledglings
and
from
his
earliest
boyhood
rolf
practised
in
shooting
with
his
bow
at
the
birds
and
he
kept
the
larder
ever
full
happy
was
hiarandi
watching
his
son
and
his
pride
in
him
was
great
as
the
lad
grew
stronger
the
father
made
for
him
stronger
bows
and
heavier
arrows
until
at
the
age
of
fourteen
rolf
used
the
bow
of
a
man
then
one
winter
they
went
down
together
into
the
valley
father
and
son
and
watched
the
sports
and
games
on
the
frozen
mere
there
the
men
of
the
place
played
at
ball
and
great
was
the
laughter
or
deep
was
the
feeling
now
hiarandi
would
not
let
rolf
play
for
often
matters
came
to
blows
and
he
would
not
have
his
son
maimed
but
when
it
came
to
shooting
with
the
bow
hiarandi
put
rolf
forward
and
it
was
seen
who
was
the
best
at
that
play
for
though
the
men
shot
rolf
surpassed
them
all
not
in
distance
but
in
skill
he
hit
the
smallest
mark
at
the
greatest
distance
and
when
hiarandi
brought
a
pigeon
and
freed
it
then
rolf
brought
it
down
no
one
there
had
seen
such
shooting
then
those
who
were
not
envious
named
the
lad
rolf
the
bowman
but
a
man
named
einar
stood
by
and
he
lived
on
the
land
which
hiarandi
father
had
sold
he
was
rich
but
covetous
and
fond
of
show
and
fond
of
praise
there
lived
with
him
one
named
ondott
an
eastfirther
who
had
left
his
district
and
come
west
a
man
without
property
he
stood
with
einar
and
watched
the
games
see
said
einar
how
proud
is
hiarandi
of
his
son
thou
hast
a
son
as
well
said
ondott
how
he
will
shine
among
these
churls
when
he
returns
from
his
fostering
in
the
south
isles
aye
answered
einar
like
an
earl
will
he
be
and
no
farmer
of
these
parts
will
compare
with
him
and
as
for
the
shooting
of
this
lad
remarked
ondott
it
is
not
so
fine
after
all
in
the
orkneys
said
einar
aloud
so
that
others
should
hear
him
they
are
better
bowmen
than
here
and
the
earl
will
have
my
son
taught
everything
now
some
who
stood
by
brought
hiarandi
this
tale
have
a
care
said
they
thy
neighbor
einar
sets
himself
above
thee
then
he
must
set
himself
high
answered
hiarandi
with
a
laugh
for
his
land
lies
far
lower
than
mine
then
others
carried
that
tale
to
einar
and
he
laid
it
up
in
his
mind
but
hiarandi
forgot
all
that
had
been
said
nor
did
he
remember
to
tell
of
it
to
asdis
when
they
had
returned
from
the
games
then
the
winter
passed
on
with
severe
storms
and
ships
were
wrecked
on
cragness
rocks
but
no
men
reached
shore
and
einar
envied
the
more
the
riches
that
came
to
hiarandi
from
the
wrecks
in
firewood
timber
and
merchandise
and
once
a
whale
came
ashore
and
that
was
great
fortune
but
one
evening
as
those
at
cragness
sat
within
the
hall
asdis
came
and
stood
beside
her
husband
and
said
listen
to
the
wind
there
is
no
need
to
listen
said
hiarandi
the
wind
howls
for
a
storm
and
this
night
will
be
bad
then
thurid
the
bondservant
who
sat
by
the
fire
looked
up
and
said
ships
are
off
the
land
hearest
thou
that
asked
asdis
in
a
low
voice
the
woman
is
strange
but
she
forecasts
well
aye
answered
hiarandi
it
is
likely
that
ships
will
be
on
the
rocks
by
morning
now
asked
asdis
dost
thou
remember
the
time
thou
camest
ashore
these
many
years
ago
how
should
i
forget
it
responded
hiarandi
but
no
one
can
rush
into
the
water
here
said
asdis
to
save
those
who
are
wrecked
that
is
true
quoth
hiarandi
i
am
sorry
for
the
mariners
yet
how
is
one
to
help
then
the
bondservant
raised
her
head
and
sang
this
song
the
sea
brings
money
money
is
bonny
bless
then
the
sea
which
brings
good
to
thee
after
that
she
sat
silent
and
sunken
as
before
hear
the
hag
said
asdis
shuddering
but
we
prosper
through
the
misfortunes
of
others
what
is
to
be
done
asked
hiarandi
it
is
in
my
mind
said
asdis
that
if
we
made
a
people
could
steer
from
shore
and
so
into
safe
harbor
farther
up
the
firth
now
quoth
hiarandi
that
might
be
done
wilt
thou
do
it
asked
asdis
then
the
woman
raised
her
head
and
sang
again
he
is
a
fool
who
leaves
old
rule
set
heart
head
how
then
butter
thy
bread
then
hiarandi
said
to
asdis
no
man
has
ever
yet
set
beacons
against
shipwreck
all
men
agree
to
take
the
fortune
of
the
sea
and
what
is
cast
on
a
man
beaches
that
is
his
by
old
custom
thinkest
thou
that
is
right
asked
asdis
moreover
went
on
hiarandi
the
sea
is
but
giving
me
again
what
it
took
away
never
can
the
sea
answered
asdis
give
thee
true
happiness
through
other
men
misfortunes
remember
the
boy
said
hiarandi
shall
i
leave
him
with
nothing
to
begin
the
world
with
for
my
own
earnings
bring
me
at
most
a
mark
of
silver
in
the
year
for
all
that
replied
asdis
it
is
in
my
mind
that
to
do
otherwise
were
to
do
better
now
canst
thou
have
the
heart
that
men
should
die
longer
on
our
rocks
and
we
not
do
our
best
to
save
them
then
hiarandi
answering
nothing
rose
and
paced
up
and
down
before
the
fire
and
the
carline
sang
once
more
take
what
is
given
no
man
is
wise
who
asketh
twice
if
earth
or
heaven
sends
him
his
prize
but
asdis
stood
upright
and
she
sang
suffer
not
wrong
to
happen
long
lest
punishment
from
heaven
be
sent
now
in
iceland
all
men
loved
the
singing
of
skalds
but
though
hiarandi
had
heard
the
carline
sing
many
times
before
never
had
he
heard
rhymes
from
his
wife
so
he
stood
astonished
then
the
bondservant
sang
again
ill
will
attend
the
beacon
lighting
bad
spirit
guiding
will
bring
false
friend
but
asdis
sang
with
great
vehemence
let
god
decide
what
fate
shall
ride
upon
the
wind
be
thou
not
blind
to
duty
hest
my
rede
is
best
list
to
the
storm
go
save
from
harm
the
mariner
whose
fate
is
near
to
others
do
as
i
did
once
to
you
and
it
seemed
to
hiarandi
as
if
she
commanded
him
moreover
as
he
listened
the
storm
roared
louder
then
he
seized
his
cloak
and
cried
to
his
thralls
up
and
out
with
me
to
make
a
beacon
though
they
dared
not
disobey
they
grumbled
and
they
got
their
cloaks
slowly
for
they
saw
slipping
away
from
them
the
fine
pickings
from
the
wreck
which
brought
them
warm
clothes
and
handsome
out
they
went
with
hiarandi
into
the
storm
and
kindled
a
great
fire
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
and
rolf
toiled
too
but
asdis
did
best
of
all
for
she
brought
out
in
a
kettle
great
strips
of
whale
blubber
and
flung
them
on
the
fire
then
the
flames
flared
high
and
wide
as
bright
as
day
and
rolf
sprang
to
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
and
gazed
upon
the
water
then
pointing
he
cried
look
down
below
was
a
ship
its
sail
flapped
in
rags
and
the
crew
were
laboring
mightily
at
the
oars
to
save
themselves
looking
with
dread
at
the
white
breakers
and
the
looming
rocks
now
in
the
strength
of
their
fear
they
held
the
vessel
where
she
was
and
by
the
broad
light
of
the
fire
every
man
of
them
was
visible
to
the
to
rolf
that
was
a
dreadful
sight
but
the
bit
of
a
sail
was
set
and
men
ran
to
the
to
hold
the
vessel
stiff
and
behold
she
moved
forward
staggered
past
the
rocks
made
clearer
water
and
wore
slowly
out
into
the
firth
even
the
thralls
shouted
at
the
sight
then
hiarandi
left
one
of
the
thralls
to
keep
the
fire
and
went
back
to
the
hall
with
those
others
there
the
carline
still
sat
so
he
is
safe
past
the
rocks
she
asked
yet
speaking
as
if
she
knew
aye
safe
answered
hiarandi
now
said
she
thou
hast
brought
thy
evil
fortune
on
thyself
and
it
will
be
hard
to
avoid
the
extreme
of
it
i
care
not
answered
hiarandi
even
though
i
suffer
for
a
good
deed
nevertheless
said
the
carline
the
future
may
be
safe
though
without
riches
if
thou
wilt
be
guided
by
me
wilt
thou
follow
my
redes
no
advices
of
thine
do
i
follow
replied
hiarandi
for
methinks
thou
still
servest
the
old
gods
and
canst
work
witchcraft
speak
no
more
of
this
matter
in
my
house
and
practise
not
thy
sorcery
before
my
eyes
for
the
law
gives
death
as
punishment
now
answered
the
woman
like
a
foolish
man
thou
rushest
on
thy
fate
and
i
see
clearly
that
thou
art
not
he
who
was
spoken
of
in
the
prophecy
not
a
fortunate
soursop
art
thou
since
the
slaying
of
kol
who
put
the
curse
on
all
our
stock
answered
hiarandi
has
but
one
of
the
soursops
prospered
how
then
should
i
be
fortunate
two
were
to
prosper
the
woman
replied
and
each
was
to
put
an
end
to
the
curse
in
his
branch
of
thy
race
snorri
the
priest
is
one
of
those
two
as
all
men
know
but
thou
art
not
the
other
and
i
believe
that
thou
art
doomed
to
fail
even
as
thy
father
was
so
i
have
long
believed
said
hiarandi
calmly
then
the
carline
rose
and
her
eyes
were
strange
as
if
they
saw
beyond
that
upon
which
she
looked
more
misfortune
is
coming
than
thou
deemest
she
said
outlawry
mayhap
even
death
be
warned
thou
art
a
heathen
and
a
witch
said
her
master
be
still
but
she
said
i
will
not
abide
the
curse
hiarandi
i
have
worked
long
in
thy
house
give
me
now
my
freedom
and
let
me
go
thou
hast
long
been
free
to
go
he
replied
take
thy
croaking
to
another
man
board
but
this
little
prophecy
i
give
to
thee
that
no
man
will
believe
thine
no
great
foresight
hast
thou
in
that
she
answered
never
have
i
been
believed
then
she
drew
on
her
cloak
and
hooded
her
face
thou
wilt
not
go
in
the
storm
asked
asdis
all
times
are
alike
the
woman
said
heed
thou
this
hiarandi
beware
the
man
who
came
in
the
ship
thou
didst
save
he
is
one
answered
hiarandi
whom
i
fear
not
at
all
beware
suits
at
law
said
the
carline
again
and
she
turned
to
go
it
needs
no
great
wisdom
to
say
that
retorted
hiarandi
upon
her
but
stay
i
send
not
people
from
my
door
penniless
nothing
is
owing
from
me
to
thee
yet
i
will
give
a
piece
of
money
soon
answered
thurid
thou
wilt
need
all
thou
hast
and
she
went
out
into
the
night
chapter
ii
of
the
soursops
and
the
curse
which
hung
on
them
of
those
things
which
had
been
said
rolf
heard
all
yet
he
had
not
spoken
now
he
drew
near
to
his
father
and
said
to
him
explain
to
me
father
the
things
of
which
the
woman
spoke
what
is
the
curse
upon
us
and
can
such
a
thing
be
true
then
hiarandi
answered
thou
knowest
we
are
of
the
soursops
who
got
their
name
when
they
sopped
with
sour
whey
the
fire
which
was
kindled
to
burn
them
in
their
house
now
gisli
the
first
of
us
slew
kol
his
wife
for
the
sake
of
his
sword
graysteel
and
kol
laid
the
curse
of
misfortune
on
us
slayings
arose
by
means
of
that
sword
there
came
the
outlawing
of
gisli
the
grandson
of
the
first
gisli
and
death
fell
in
most
branches
of
the
house
fourteen
years
gisli
was
outlaw
even
as
has
been
to
this
year
grettir
the
strong
who
is
the
great
outlaw
of
our
day
but
gisli
was
slain
and
his
brother
while
his
sister
died
son
of
that
sister
is
snorri
the
priest
who
alone
of
us
has
prospered
for
though
no
slayings
have
ever
happened
in
our
branch
unlucky
are
we
all
as
is
plain
to
see
i
have
often
wondered
said
rolf
how
it
is
that
we
live
here
in
this
great
hall
and
have
but
us
three
and
the
servants
to
fill
it
there
are
places
for
seven
fires
down
the
middle
of
the
hall
yet
we
use
but
one
and
all
the
benches
were
once
used
since
they
are
worn
seats
for
fifty
men
and
the
women
seats
besides
once
said
hiarandi
my
father
had
so
many
on
his
farm
that
nightly
the
hall
was
full
but
those
are
einar
now
and
all
our
riches
have
passed
away
to
him
yet
this
house
is
the
finest
in
all
these
parts
i
was
at
the
building
of
it
in
my
youth
and
here
he
made
sure
that
the
thrall
was
not
listening
i
myself
made
the
secret
panels
by
which
we
can
escape
in
case
of
burning
for
since
that
burning
so
long
ago
no
soursop
builds
himself
a
house
in
which
men
may
trap
him
but
thou
hast
no
enemies
father
asked
the
lad
no
enemies
i
hope
answered
hiarandi
but
few
friends
i
am
sure
since
only
frodi
the
smith
my
mother
cousin
is
of
our
kin
for
i
count
not
snorri
the
priest
but
why
not
snorri
the
priest
asked
rolf
my
father
answered
hiarandi
quarrelled
with
him
and
called
him
coward
for
snorri
would
not
take
up
at
arms
a
suit
my
father
lost
at
law
then
rolf
thought
awhile
all
men
knew
of
snorri
the
priest
who
was
no
temple
priest
at
all
but
a
priest
of
the
law
for
the
title
had
come
down
from
heathen
times
when
leaders
had
sway
over
all
matters
both
in
religion
and
law
and
to
be
priest
was
to
be
chieftain
but
usage
and
the
new
religion
changed
that
by
degrees
so
that
to
be
priest
now
meant
to
be
a
giver
of
the
law
with
a
seat
at
the
quarter
courts
and
at
the
althing
the
great
yearly
gathering
to
which
from
all
iceland
men
went
to
settle
suits
and
snorri
the
priest
was
well
known
as
the
richest
man
in
broadfirth
dales
the
shrewdest
and
wisest
in
all
things
worldly
and
a
master
at
the
law
it
would
be
well
said
the
lad
to
have
snorri
on
our
side
it
is
better
said
asdis
never
to
go
to
the
law
lawsuits
and
quarrels
are
bad
things
and
they
bring
a
man
fortune
to
naught
and
hiarandi
added
by
law
we
have
ever
suffered
then
rolf
was
silent
and
thought
of
what
had
been
said
how
the
old
woman
had
prophesied
trouble
at
the
law
and
by
what
man
that
trouble
should
come
and
as
he
thought
upon
the
words
she
and
his
father
had
spoken
he
thought
that
they
had
spoken
with
knowledge
though
of
different
kinds
for
while
the
woman
prophesied
vaguely
his
father
had
seemed
to
know
who
the
man
should
be
father
asked
rolf
knowest
thou
who
the
man
is
that
came
upon
the
ship
i
know
answered
hiarandi
asdis
asked
who
then
is
he
hiarandi
said
saw
ye
upon
the
ship
as
it
lay
below
us
the
faces
of
any
of
the
men
aye
answered
they
both
for
it
was
as
clear
as
day
saw
ye
then
asked
hiarandi
one
who
stood
by
the
mast
a
tall
man
with
a
great
beard
i
saw
him
answered
rolf
he
stood
and
held
by
a
rope
and
the
mast
and
i
thought
he
should
be
the
captain
but
he
gave
no
commands
nor
did
any
man
heed
him
for
all
worked
of
themselves
yet
as
i
guess
said
hiarandi
the
captain
was
he
and
he
was
the
man
of
whom
the
carline
spoke
who
is
he
then
asked
the
boy
listen
said
hiarandi
and
i
will
tell
thee
of
one
in
my
family
of
whom
i
have
never
yet
spoken
there
were
two
of
us
when
i
was
a
lad
brothers
and
the
other
was
named
kiartan
he
was
younger
than
i
by
a
year
and
different
in
all
his
ways
yet
i
have
often
thought
that
my
father
had
not
enough
patience
with
him
for
he
sent
him
to
bad
companions
rather
than
weaned
him
from
them
and
at
last
he
drove
him
from
the
house
altogether
then
kiartan
took
to
the
sea
he
was
not
bad
remember
but
weak
perhaps
and
foolish
took
to
the
sea
and
we
saw
him
not
for
years
once
only
he
came
back
out
at
elbow
and
asked
my
father
for
money
money
he
got
but
gave
the
promise
to
ask
nothing
from
the
inheritance
and
this
was
handselled
before
witnesses
my
father
giving
much
the
rest
to
come
to
me
then
kiartan
went
away
again
and
not
until
this
night
have
i
seen
him
but
if
that
was
his
ship
then
he
has
prospered
yet
it
was
he
the
woman
meant
asked
rolf
who
else
returned
his
father
how
should
he
asked
the
boy
bring
trouble
on
thee
i
see
not
answered
hiarandi
how
he
should
bring
either
evil
or
good
then
he
closed
his
mouth
and
became
thoughtful
in
a
manner
he
had
asdis
motioned
rolf
to
be
silent
and
nothing
more
was
said
in
the
matter
chapter
iii
kiartan
at
cragness
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
thereafter
as
rolf
stood
by
the
gate
of
the
enclosure
which
protected
the
farm
buildings
he
saw
a
man
coming
on
a
horse
and
knew
him
for
his
father
brother
kiartan
he
was
a
big
man
heavily
bearded
dressed
in
clothes
and
hung
about
with
gold
chains
his
eye
was
bright
and
roving
his
face
was
genial
and
he
looked
about
him
as
he
came
as
one
who
is
well
contented
yet
rolf
liked
him
not
now
kiartan
rode
up
to
the
enclosure
and
saw
the
boy
ho
he
cried
come
hold
my
horse
and
stable
him
so
rolf
took
the
horse
by
the
bridle
and
held
him
while
the
man
dismounted
then
the
boy
started
to
lead
the
beast
to
the
stable
where
is
thy
mistress
asked
kiartan
my
mother
is
in
the
house
answered
rolf
now
kiartan
cried
i
took
thee
for
a
but
thy
father
had
ever
a
love
of
the
earth
and
so
perhaps
hast
thou
knowest
thou
me
thou
art
my
uncle
replied
the
lad
now
cried
kiartan
staring
what
spirit
told
thee
of
me
five
nights
ago
answered
rolf
thou
stoodst
below
on
the
deck
of
thy
ship
and
lookedst
up
at
cragness
and
our
beacon
saved
thee
aye
said
kiartan
we
had
work
to
save
our
lives
and
a
close
miss
we
made
of
the
tusks
but
he
never
gave
a
word
of
thanks
either
to
rolf
or
to
hiarandi
for
the
saving
of
his
life
thou
art
wise
to
stay
at
home
boy
for
see
how
a
sailor
life
hangs
ever
on
a
thread
now
stable
the
horse
and
i
will
see
thy
mother
the
farmer
is
likely
in
the
field
so
rolf
stabled
the
horse
and
called
his
father
from
his
work
and
hiarandi
came
muttering
though
he
meant
not
that
rolf
should
hear
poor
steel
comes
often
home
for
a
new
edge
but
he
greeted
his
brother
well
and
bade
him
stay
with
them
for
the
winter
even
for
that
am
i
come
answered
kiartan
for
my
cargo
is
already
sold
and
my
ship
laid
up
for
the
winter
near
hvamm
and
i
come
home
to
my
kinsman
no
poor
penny
am
i
this
time
to
need
any
man
help
perhaps
and
he
looked
about
him
i
can
even
help
thee
but
the
buildings
were
neat
and
and
the
farm
was
in
no
need
of
improvement
i
need
nothing
said
hiarandi
and
i
even
have
money
out
at
call
there
in
the
neighborhood
where
thy
ship
is
laid
but
come
the
wife
prepares
the
meal
lay
aside
thy
cloak
and
be
at
home
and
so
kiartan
entered
on
his
wintering
at
cragness
quiet
is
the
winter
in
iceland
when
men
have
no
work
to
do
in
the
field
save
the
watching
of
horses
and
the
feeding
of
the
sheep
and
kine
weatherwise
must
a
man
be
to
prepare
against
the
storms
which
sweep
with
suddenness
from
off
the
water
and
enfold
the
land
with
snow
yet
hiarandi
flocks
were
small
and
his
was
not
wide
and
both
he
and
rolf
were
keen
to
see
the
changes
in
the
weather
and
as
for
their
horses
they
stayed
ever
near
the
buildings
so
all
were
free
to
go
to
the
gatherings
which
men
made
for
games
and
in
times
of
fair
weather
thither
kiartan
loved
to
go
dressed
in
his
fine
clothes
and
talking
much
but
nights
when
he
sat
at
home
he
would
speak
of
his
travels
and
what
a
fine
place
the
world
was
and
how
little
there
was
for
a
man
here
in
iceland
he
said
it
was
nothing
to
be
a
farmer
but
a
great
thing
to
rove
the
sea
and
to
live
not
in
this
land
where
all
were
equal
but
where
there
were
kings
earls
and
other
great
men
once
as
he
spoke
thus
he
provoked
hiarandi
to
words
meseems
brother
the
farmer
said
that
thou
hast
forgotten
the
way
our
forefathers
thought
for
it
was
to
avoid
kings
and
earls
that
they
left
their
lands
in
norway
and
came
over
the
sea
hither
and
those
whom
thou
prizest
so
high
are
so
little
thought
of
here
that
we
make
nothing
of
them
whatever
now
answered
kiartan
thy
neighbor
einar
thinks
well
of
earls
for
he
has
fostered
his
son
with
the
earl
of
the
orkneys
the
lad
will
understand
little
of
our
ways
when
he
returns
replied
hiarandi
for
all
that
kiartan
said
i
name
the
son
of
einar
luckier
than
thy
son
here
a
great
court
is
held
in
the
orkneys
and
all
matters
are
to
be
learned
there
then
hiarandi
made
response
no
court
can
teach
good
sense
to
a
dolt
and
no
wisdom
will
flourish
unless
there
be
good
ground
for
it
to
sprout
i
have
seen
wise
men
bred
in
this
little
land
and
fools
that
came
out
of
norway
then
kiartan
talked
not
so
much
before
hiarandi
of
the
things
he
had
seen
nor
for
a
time
before
rolf
either
but
when
there
came
again
the
great
winter
to
which
all
went
and
rolf
shot
again
with
the
bow
before
them
all
and
proved
himself
the
most
skilful
though
not
yet
the
strongest
after
that
kiartan
made
more
of
the
lad
men
said
he
to
rolf
one
day
when
they
were
alone
may
be
able
to
shoot
farther
than
thou
with
the
bow
for
two
did
it
but
none
shot
so
surely
and
some
day
thou
wilt
outshoot
them
as
well
i
think
not
much
of
it
answered
rolf
now
said
kiartan
thou
shouldst
learn
to
prize
thyself
higher
for
in
the
orkneys
good
archers
are
welcome
in
the
earl
and
a
man
is
honored
and
well
paid
yet
he
is
no
longer
his
own
man
answered
rolf
what
of
that
asked
kiartan
if
for
a
few
years
he
can
see
the
world
and
make
his
fortune
also
then
he
is
forever
after
a
greater
man
at
home
think
more
of
thyself
and
at
other
times
he
spoke
in
the
same
strain
bidding
rolf
value
himself
higher
and
he
told
of
the
great
world
and
described
his
journeys
for
he
had
been
he
said
as
far
as
the
great
middle
sea
had
traded
in
italy
and
had
even
seen
rome
and
rolf
was
greatly
interested
in
those
tales
for
the
lands
across
the
sea
were
of
moment
to
all
icelanders
since
many
a
man
fared
abroad
often
and
no
man
thought
himself
complete
who
had
not
once
made
the
voyage
so
he
listened
willingly
when
kiartan
told
his
tales
at
evening
in
the
hall
the
parents
were
inattentive
but
sometimes
hiarandi
and
sometimes
asdis
would
interrupt
the
story
sending
the
lad
to
some
task
or
to
bed
now
at
last
it
draws
toward
spring
and
the
time
approaches
when
kiartan
must
go
away
to
his
ship
to
dight
it
for
the
voyage
and
it
was
remembered
afterward
how
one
evening
he
drew
hiarandi
on
to
talk
of
his
savings
and
learned
what
money
he
had
out
at
interest
and
with
whom
and
kiartan
spoke
the
oftener
with
rolf
praising
him
for
the
fine
man
he
was
growing
to
be
then
at
his
last
night
at
cragness
the
shipmaster
said
as
all
sat
together
before
the
fire
brother
thou
knowest
i
must
go
away
aye
answered
hiarandi
now
said
kiartan
let
me
say
to
thee
what
is
in
my
mind
take
it
not
ill
that
i
speak
freely
but
i
think
it
wrong
of
thee
that
thou
keepest
here
at
home
such
a
fine
lad
as
is
rolf
thy
son
and
he
would
have
put
his
hand
upon
the
boy
shoulder
but
rolf
drew
away
kiartan
went
on
now
i
am
going
to
the
south
isles
send
rolf
with
me
and
let
him
see
the
world
then
hiarandi
grew
uneasy
and
he
answered
speak
no
more
of
this
some
day
he
shall
see
the
lands
across
the
main
but
as
yet
he
is
too
young
nay
answered
kiartan
he
is
nearly
what
sayest
thou
rolf
wilt
thou
not
go
with
me
rolf
answered
i
will
be
ruled
by
my
father
i
have
made
much
money
reasoned
kiartan
and
thou
canst
do
the
same
i
care
not
for
trading
replied
rolf
there
are
courts
to
be
seen
said
kiartan
and
thou
mayest
serve
in
them
thyself
i
am
not
ready
to
be
a
servant
quoth
rolf
but
thou
mayest
see
wars
and
fighting
cried
kiartan
i
have
no
quarrels
of
my
own
answered
the
boy
and
i
mix
not
in
the
affairs
of
others
now
hiarandi
and
asdis
had
listened
with
both
anger
and
fear
anger
that
kiartan
should
so
tempt
the
boy
and
fear
at
what
rolf
might
answer
but
rolf
spoke
with
wisdom
beyond
his
years
and
at
his
last
response
hiarandi
smiled
and
asdis
clapped
her
hands
then
kiartan
started
from
his
seat
and
cried
out
upon
ye
all
for
and
he
would
speak
no
more
with
them
that
night
but
went
to
his
locked
bed
and
shut
himself
in
yet
he
spoke
to
the
lad
once
more
in
the
morning
out
by
the
byre
while
rolf
was
saddling
the
horse
surely
said
kiartan
thou
didst
not
mean
what
thou
saidst
last
night
for
the
fear
of
thy
parents
was
in
thy
mind
now
let
me
tell
thee
what
we
can
do
i
will
go
on
for
the
lading
of
my
ship
and
that
will
take
a
fortnight
time
then
i
will
wait
for
thee
at
the
mouth
of
laxriver
and
thou
canst
come
thither
and
join
me
secretly
now
said
the
lad
if
i
tell
my
father
this
he
will
give
thee
a
beating
therefore
i
will
remain
silent
until
thy
ship
has
sailed
then
kiartan
turned
pale
and
cursed
and
made
as
if
to
strike
his
nephew
but
rolf
put
his
hand
to
his
belt
and
kiartan
drew
away
yet
rolf
had
no
knife
i
see
said
rolf
that
thou
art
not
quick
at
arms
nor
sure
of
thy
own
strength
even
against
me
and
i
knew
thou
wert
a
coward
long
ago
when
i
saw
thee
on
thy
ship
deck
giving
no
orders
but
letting
other
men
save
thy
ship
and
thyself
no
great
deeds
of
daring
would
i
see
with
thee
as
shipmaster
when
kiartan
rode
away
he
was
as
glad
at
parting
as
were
those
of
the
house
he
is
not
changed
said
hiarandi
in
all
the
years
he
has
been
gone
where
asked
asdis
is
the
harm
which
he
was
to
do
us
and
she
laughed
but
rejoiced
too
soon
for
after
six
weeks
men
came
to
hiarandi
sent
from
laxriverdale
where
traders
had
given
goods
to
kiartan
upon
his
promise
that
hiarandi
should
pay
and
it
was
discovered
that
kiartan
had
not
only
used
the
money
which
hiarandi
had
out
at
call
in
that
region
but
had
obtained
goods
from
other
men
creating
debts
and
he
had
filled
all
his
ship
at
hiarandi
expense
then
rolf
told
to
his
father
his
own
tale
of
kiartan
secret
offer
and
hiarandi
was
bitterly
wroth
and
then
began
those
troubles
which
thurid
had
foreseen
for
when
hiarandi
refused
to
pay
for
the
goods
but
instead
sought
to
regain
his
money
from
those
who
had
supplied
kiartan
the
matter
was
brought
to
the
law
and
first
at
the
quarter
thing
and
then
at
the
althing
many
small
suits
were
disputed
but
the
end
of
the
matter
was
that
hiarandi
was
beaten
by
the
skill
of
lawyers
and
he
had
to
lose
his
money
and
pay
more
besides
and
stood
stripped
of
all
which
he
had
laid
up
against
his
age
or
against
that
time
when
rolf
should
need
a
start
in
life
and
the
farmer
was
greatly
cast
down
recalling
the
misfortunes
of
the
soursops
and
how
he
himself
had
been
always
called
the
unlucky
but
asdis
and
rolf
strove
to
keep
him
in
good
heart
chapter
iv
of
einar
and
ondott
now
the
tale
turns
to
speak
of
einar
and
his
household
how
they
dwelt
at
fellstead
upon
the
land
einar
was
a
rich
man
and
he
kept
a
large
household
of
many
thralls
and
servants
and
for
his
pleasure
that
he
might
seem
the
greater
in
the
eyes
of
his
neighbors
he
kept
men
who
did
no
work
but
bore
arms
wheresoever
they
went
yet
it
had
never
been
known
that
einar
brought
any
matter
to
bloodshed
he
was
not
firm
in
any
dealings
but
he
wished
to
be
thought
a
great
man
his
holding
was
wide
for
he
owned
all
that
the
fathers
of
hiarandi
had
had
yet
from
his
yard
he
often
looked
with
no
contented
eye
toward
the
hall
of
hiarandi
where
it
stood
above
the
crags
looking
far
over
firth
and
fell
now
of
the
men
of
einar
household
ondott
had
the
ruling
for
he
pleased
einar
much
yet
they
were
different
in
all
outward
ways
for
einar
was
short
and
plump
given
to
puffing
and
swelling
as
he
spoke
and
of
many
smooth
words
but
ondott
was
tall
and
thin
and
sour
and
of
surly
speech
einar
was
fond
of
dress
while
ondott
went
in
simple
clothes
yet
they
both
loved
money
and
some
accused
ondott
of
hoarding
but
einar
spent
freely
seeking
to
gain
by
gifts
what
his
wit
could
not
win
for
him
for
he
was
not
loved
and
men
thought
little
of
his
counsels
of
the
women
at
fellstead
one
old
freedwoman
was
chief
and
she
held
in
especial
care
the
daughter
of
einar
helga
by
name
who
was
yet
young
being
but
thirteen
years
of
age
she
was
of
a
sweet
nature
now
one
morning
helga
stood
with
dalla
the
old
woman
before
the
door
of
the
hall
and
they
saw
where
came
toward
them
a
woman
much
bent
and
covered
with
a
cape
and
hood
when
she
came
near
they
knew
her
for
thurid
from
cragness
she
begged
them
for
lodging
and
work
dalla
sent
for
einar
how
is
it
come
asked
einar
that
thou
hast
left
hiarandi
the
man
said
she
calls
upon
his
doom
and
i
will
not
stay
to
share
it
and
she
told
of
the
beacon
and
how
thereby
a
ship
had
been
saved
now
quoth
einar
hiarandi
is
a
fool
so
to
break
an
old
custom
yet
meseems
said
helga
timidly
that
it
was
a
kind
thing
to
do
thou
art
but
a
child
he
answered
reprovingly
but
she
came
closer
to
him
and
pulled
his
sleeve
let
not
the
old
woman
stay
here
she
whispered
for
i
like
not
her
looks
and
i
mistrust
her
but
ondott
who
heard
said
nay
let
us
keep
the
old
carline
if
only
to
spite
hiarandi
and
dalla
added
she
is
a
good
worker
and
handy
to
have
about
the
place
let
us
give
her
room
so
einar
bade
thurid
go
within
and
do
what
work
was
set
her
in
pay
for
her
keep
but
he
asked
her
before
he
went
away
why
camest
thou
here
a
rat
said
she
will
leave
a
house
that
is
sure
to
fall
and
seek
one
which
will
stand
then
einar
was
greatly
pleased
with
her
and
bade
give
her
a
better
cloak
so
it
was
that
thurid
dwelt
at
fellstead
and
paid
well
with
her
work
for
her
keep
but
at
cragness
she
was
missed
and
the
work
was
harder
yet
thurid
made
no
more
prophecies
nor
spoke
of
those
which
had
been
made
but
it
was
known
that
the
thralls
of
hiarandi
were
set
to
light
beacons
on
stormy
nights
and
he
was
much
laughed
at
by
the
dwellers
at
fellstead
and
his
thralls
found
it
hard
work
and
became
greatly
discontented
yet
since
it
was
winter
time
they
had
little
else
to
do
now
one
of
them
was
named
malcolm
a
scot
and
he
came
one
day
to
fellstead
when
he
was
not
needed
at
the
farm
and
ondott
met
him
and
asked
him
in
and
asked
him
questions
of
matters
at
cragness
as
they
spoke
by
the
fire
thurid
passed
by
and
she
sang
to
herself
evil
and
ill
come
together
still
malcolm
asked
does
the
woman
still
make
her
rhymes
with
you
little
have
i
heard
her
sing
answered
ondott
but
what
sang
she
with
you
then
malcolm
told
of
the
singing
of
thurid
and
asdis
and
of
the
prophecies
of
the
old
woman
and
when
he
went
away
ondott
gave
him
a
small
piece
of
money
and
bade
him
come
again
then
ondott
called
thurid
and
asked
her
of
the
things
she
had
said
at
cragness
what
they
might
mean
but
he
got
little
from
her
for
first
she
would
not
speak
and
then
she
only
muttered
and
at
last
all
she
said
was
this
rhyme
no
need
to
teach
or
trick
or
speech
to
him
whose
mind
all
wiles
will
find
and
ondott
could
make
nothing
out
of
that
moreover
because
it
was
kiartan
whom
hiarandi
had
saved
he
thought
that
the
farmer
had
strengthened
himself
by
his
deed
for
only
when
the
news
came
of
the
trick
of
kiartan
in
cheating
his
brother
did
ondott
think
that
there
might
be
something
in
the
old
woman
forecasting
and
he
and
einar
spoke
cheerfully
together
of
the
misfortune
to
their
neighbor
then
summer
drew
on
and
the
quarter
thing
was
held
and
then
came
bad
news
to
einar
in
his
hall
for
a
seafaring
man
landed
at
hunafloi
and
came
across
to
broadfirth
and
he
brought
word
that
in
the
orkneys
kiartan
had
foully
slain
a
man
of
broadfirth
whose
nearest
of
kin
was
einar
so
that
it
was
duty
to
follow
up
the
here
it
must
be
said
for
those
who
know
not
the
customs
of
those
days
that
the
death
of
a
man
called
for
atonement
from
the
slayer
either
his
death
or
a
payment
in
money
unless
the
slaying
could
be
justified
the
nearest
of
kin
must
take
the
suit
against
the
slayer
and
if
the
slayer
should
die
then
his
nearest
of
kin
must
take
the
defence
and
the
law
is
clearly
shown
by
the
case
of
the
and
other
famous
quarrels
when
from
small
broils
great
feuds
arose
from
the
duty
of
kinship
and
the
unwillingness
to
pay
for
another
deed
thus
einar
took
upon
him
his
duty
and
vowed
that
kiartan
should
pay
with
either
money
or
blood
all
stood
by
and
heard
this
and
they
applauded
but
ondott
said
come
now
outside
with
me
and
speak
of
this
but
give
the
messenger
food
and
bid
him
rest
here
the
night
so
that
was
done
and
einar
went
out
into
the
yard
with
ondott
and
walked
up
and
down
with
him
said
ondott
long
are
we
likely
to
wait
ere
we
lay
hands
on
kiartan
for
he
hath
set
his
own
brother
strong
against
him
and
scarce
will
he
dare
return
to
iceland
that
may
be
true
said
einar
gloomily
i
like
it
not
said
ondott
that
hiarandi
should
know
this
spite
his
brother
has
done
thee
and
yet
be
free
himself
in
the
old
days
which
are
not
so
long
past
a
man
would
have
gone
against
hiarandi
with
weapons
and
he
hath
no
relatives
to
harm
thee
for
all
that
answered
einar
the
men
of
the
quarter
would
not
like
it
lawfully
must
vengeance
be
taken
or
not
at
all
yet
it
is
hard
if
my
money
and
thy
wit
can
not
rid
me
of
these
brothers
who
anger
me
and
hiarandi
more
than
kiartan
and
he
looked
across
at
cragness
with
fretting
well
mayest
thou
say
that
answered
ondott
for
there
stands
hiarandi
hall
which
he
can
not
fill
while
thou
in
thine
art
cramped
for
room
it
is
plainly
true
what
people
say
that
thou
canst
never
come
into
the
honor
which
should
be
thine
while
thou
livest
here
where
strangers
take
thee
for
hiarandi
tenant
or
even
his
freedman
they
take
me
for
his
freedman
cried
einar
now
that
is
not
to
be
borne
and
i
say
to
thee
get
me
hiarandi
house
and
i
will
reward
thee
well
then
ondott
laid
a
plan
before
him
it
should
be
given
out
that
kiartan
was
dead
the
man
who
brought
the
news
of
the
slaying
might
be
bribed
to
swear
to
kiartan
death
then
the
could
be
brought
against
hiarandi
in
place
of
kiartan
and
all
men
knew
that
hiarandi
had
no
money
to
pay
the
fine
so
that
he
must
sell
his
farm
now
quoth
einar
in
great
delight
i
will
lengthen
thy
name
and
thou
shalt
be
called
ondott
crafty
for
that
was
a
saying
in
those
days
to
lengthen
a
man
name
by
giving
him
a
nickname
then
they
called
from
the
house
that
man
who
had
brought
the
news
because
he
was
an
outlander
he
was
easily
persuaded
to
swear
to
kiartan
death
einar
gave
him
money
both
for
himself
and
to
pay
his
passage
outward
then
witnesses
were
called
to
hear
the
oath
and
on
the
morrow
the
man
departed
and
took
ship
for
ireland
and
he
is
out
of
the
story
chapter
v
the
summoning
of
hiarandi
when
that
man
who
had
brought
the
news
and
made
the
false
swearing
was
well
out
of
the
country
then
ondott
bestirred
himself
to
go
against
hiarandi
said
he
to
einar
it
is
time
that
we
summon
hiarandi
soon
to
answer
to
the
for
the
sitting
of
the
althing
draws
nigh
to
that
einar
assented
and
on
the
morrow
ondott
bade
two
men
arm
themselves
and
go
with
them
to
cragness
why
need
we
men
asked
einar
we
must
have
witnesses
to
the
summoning
answered
ondott
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
bear
arms
said
einar
we
will
prepare
ourselves
replied
ondott
as
becomes
thy
dignity
and
as
regards
thy
safety
for
hiarandi
hath
a
quick
temper
then
einar
said
no
more
and
they
rode
to
cragness
but
ondott
knew
well
that
at
such
summonings
quarrels
often
arose
and
he
said
privily
to
his
men
hallmund
and
hallvard
look
that
your
swords
be
loose
in
their
sheaths
they
rode
into
the
yard
at
cragness
and
called
hiarandi
from
his
house
hiarandi
came
and
with
him
rolf
bearing
his
bow
for
he
was
about
to
go
out
for
birds
hiarandi
said
einar
we
have
come
to
speak
of
the
for
the
slaying
of
my
kinsman
that
thy
kinsman
is
slain
i
knew
answered
hiarandi
but
i
see
not
how
it
affects
me
in
any
way
so
long
as
my
brother
be
living
but
thy
brother
is
dead
replied
einar
and
told
that
kiartan
was
shipwrecked
in
the
orkneys
this
is
the
first
i
have
heard
of
it
said
hiarandi
then
ondott
spoke
knowing
thy
suspicious
nature
said
he
i
brought
with
us
the
men
who
were
witnesses
to
the
oath
the
messenger
made
thus
canst
thou
know
thy
brother
is
truly
dead
hallvard
and
hallmund
said
they
had
witnessed
the
oath
hiarandi
answered
no
word
but
looked
from
one
to
the
other
now
said
ondott
these
same
men
will
be
witnesses
to
what
we
say
here
together
and
this
he
said
in
a
manner
to
provoke
hiarandi
yet
he
still
answered
nothing
is
it
not
better
asked
einar
that
this
matter
be
settled
here
quietly
between
neighbors
rather
than
be
brought
before
the
judges
at
the
althing
quietly
settled
is
always
best
answered
hiarandi
yet
i
see
not
how
this
matter
is
to
be
settled
at
all
seeing
i
have
no
money
to
make
atonement
now
said
ondott
quickly
to
einar
let
me
speak
for
thee
in
this
affair
then
einar
gave
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
ondott
all
men
know
began
ondott
then
that
thou
art
poor
hiarandi
and
he
saw
hiarandi
flush
with
anger
then
he
went
on
to
propose
that
an
exchange
be
made
of
cragness
for
some
parts
of
einar
land
much
less
in
value
and
he
spoke
with
such
words
that
hiarandi
would
feel
insulted
and
marked
him
grow
ever
redder
in
the
face
when
he
had
finished
hiarandi
burst
out
upon
him
foolish
are
ye
to
suppose
cried
hiarandi
that
i
will
ever
give
up
this
stead
which
my
fathers
have
settled
let
this
matter
come
to
the
courts
of
law
ondott
spoke
to
einar
there
is
no
reasoning
with
a
madman
thou
must
recite
the
summons
then
einar
who
knew
the
law
well
spoke
the
summons
and
named
the
deed
which
was
done
on
his
kinsman
and
made
hiarandi
answerable
and
called
him
to
appear
before
the
quarter
court
at
the
althing
there
to
justify
the
slaying
or
pay
the
or
be
made
an
outlaw
everything
he
said
in
due
legal
form
and
ondott
and
the
two
men
were
named
as
witnesses
then
he
prepared
to
ride
away
but
ondott
spoke
once
more
if
thou
canst
not
keep
land
hiarandi
better
than
thy
father
then
must
thou
lose
this
place
in
the
end
hiarandi
could
not
restrain
his
wrath
he
spoke
no
word
but
he
strode
to
ondott
and
smote
with
his
staff
ondott
warded
the
blow
but
the
arm
was
broken
at
the
wrist
then
ondott
cried
to
hallvard
and
hallmund
set
upon
him
those
two
drew
their
swords
and
in
that
moment
hiarandi
stood
in
danger
of
his
life
but
rolf
had
strung
his
bow
and
set
an
arrow
on
the
string
he
drew
the
shaft
to
its
head
and
aimed
at
einar
and
cried
now
einar
dies
if
my
father
is
hurt
illustration
einar
dies
if
my
father
is
hurt
they
drew
away
hastily
and
dared
do
no
more
for
they
knew
the
aim
of
the
lad
nothing
more
was
done
in
violence
yet
before
he
rode
away
did
ondott
summon
hiarandi
for
that
hurt
to
him
and
there
the
matter
rested
with
two
suits
against
hiarandi
then
all
was
quiet
until
the
time
came
for
folk
to
ride
to
the
althing
chapter
vi
of
what
hiarandi
should
do
hiarandi
spoke
not
at
all
of
the
suits
against
him
yet
he
was
continually
gloomy
and
one
day
he
said
much
better
were
it
now
had
i
never
lighted
the
beacon
that
night
thou
knowest
responded
asdis
that
thou
didst
right
still
said
hiarandi
summer
gales
oft
bring
wrecks
and
one
ship
might
pay
the
for
me
for
all
that
asdis
answered
thou
hast
not
now
the
heart
to
stop
lighting
the
beacon
then
on
the
second
night
thereafter
came
a
storm
but
nothing
was
said
except
that
hiarandi
bade
the
beacon
be
lighted
yet
he
was
gloomier
than
ever
one
night
rolf
asked
him
why
is
it
that
thou
art
to
answer
for
that
deed
which
my
uncle
has
done
one
must
answer
for
a
kinsman
deed
answered
his
father
when
that
kinsman
is
dead
and
what
is
the
punishment
asked
rolf
for
slaying
a
fine
or
outlawry
replied
hiarandi
tell
me
of
outlawry
begged
rolf
for
i
hear
of
outlaws
who
live
and
work
among
men
and
of
those
who
flee
into
hiding
and
of
those
who
go
overseas
there
are
outlaws
of
many
kinds
answered
hiarandi
some
outlaws
are
condemned
not
to
leave
a
district
or
even
a
farm
but
some
must
leave
iceland
or
else
defend
their
lives
but
most
outlawries
are
like
this
that
a
man
must
go
abroad
three
winters
and
then
he
is
free
to
return
if
he
stays
his
enemies
may
slay
him
if
they
can
and
no
man
may
ask
atonement
thus
they
who
burned
njal
in
his
house
did
fare
abroad
but
on
the
other
hand
gisli
our
ancestor
lived
in
hiding
and
would
not
go
and
grettir
the
strong
as
all
men
know
lives
an
outlaw
in
one
district
or
another
and
no
man
has
taken
him
though
there
is
a
great
price
set
upon
his
head
if
thou
art
made
outlaw
asked
rolf
what
wilt
thou
do
ask
me
not
said
hiarandi
for
the
matter
troubles
me
if
i
go
abroad
how
will
ye
all
live
and
it
will
profit
you
nothing
if
i
stay
and
am
slain
yet
if
i
am
made
outlaw
and
go
not
my
goods
and
the
farm
are
forfeit
as
greatly
as
hiarandi
feared
the
outcome
of
these
suits
so
were
those
at
fellstead
pleased
by
their
hopes
and
no
one
heard
the
carline
thurid
who
sang
to
herself
when
she
heard
ondott
boast
he
laughs
too
soon
who
doth
forget
soursop
blood
binds
kinsmen
yet
but
asdis
thought
rightly
in
the
matter
for
she
said
to
hiarandi
what
wilt
thou
do
for
thy
defence
at
law
is
there
no
lawyer
to
help
thee
help
is
offered
answered
her
husband
to
those
who
have
money
and
i
have
none
then
wilt
thou
ask
help
of
snorri
the
priest
there
is
no
other
to
give
thee
counsel
not
close
replied
hiarandi
is
the
tie
of
blood
between
us
and
small
is
the
friendship
moreover
snorri
draws
ever
to
those
who
wax
in
fortune
and
such
is
einar
and
he
helps
little
those
whose
fortunes
wane
and
such
am
i
now
cried
asdis
be
not
as
a
man
who
sees
his
own
doom
and
stirs
not
to
help
himself
where
is
thy
manhood
bestir
thyself
for
my
sake
and
rolfs
and
do
what
thou
canst
for
our
good
now
promise
me
that
thou
wilt
ask
help
of
snorri
thus
she
stirred
hiarandi
to
shake
off
his
gloom
so
that
he
promised
and
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
ride
to
the
althing
he
went
with
a
better
heart
chapter
vii
how
hiarandi
received
the
lesser
outlawry
hiarandi
travelled
to
the
althing
all
alone
he
had
a
good
horse
and
stout
clothes
but
in
nothing
was
he
noticeable
so
that
men
who
passed
him
on
the
road
gave
him
only
the
yet
asked
him
not
to
join
their
company
and
he
saw
how
men
of
power
rode
with
their
thingmen
behind
them
all
in
colored
clothes
and
well
armed
he
saw
hrut
the
famous
swordsman
how
he
rode
with
eleven
sons
at
his
back
and
men
besides
so
that
all
thought
that
a
grand
sight
and
many
others
rode
to
the
althing
with
great
pride
then
hiarandi
recalled
that
his
own
father
had
ridden
in
holiday
guise
to
bring
his
suits
and
as
he
compared
his
father
state
with
his
own
he
who
went
alone
and
unnoticed
but
at
home
was
called
the
unlucky
then
his
heart
was
greatly
cast
down
within
him
he
came
to
the
thingvalla
where
all
the
plain
was
a
busy
hive
of
men
and
he
found
humble
lodging
at
a
booth
and
stabled
his
horse
under
the
cliff
and
spent
the
night
alone
amid
the
throng
then
on
the
morrow
at
midday
he
went
out
to
have
speech
with
snorri
at
booth
he
was
told
that
snorri
was
at
talk
with
a
client
within
then
i
will
wait
said
hiarandi
and
sat
down
on
a
bench
at
the
door
but
it
was
bitter
to
him
that
he
should
sit
there
a
poor
suitor
at
the
door
of
his
kinsman
now
he
had
not
sat
there
long
when
he
heard
his
own
name
spoken
within
and
he
knew
the
voice
of
his
neighbor
einar
and
einar
was
saying
thou
art
not
bound
to
hiarandi
in
any
way
then
he
heard
another
voice
the
voice
of
an
old
man
for
snorri
was
advanced
in
years
saying
small
enough
are
the
ties
between
myself
and
hiarandi
then
hiarandi
rose
and
walked
away
and
he
forgot
all
he
had
promised
his
wife
and
all
she
had
said
to
him
how
he
should
forget
himself
in
struggling
for
her
sake
and
rolf
but
that
melancholy
came
over
him
which
was
his
greatest
weakness
i
am
too
late
he
said
to
himself
for
einar
is
before
me
my
case
is
lost
and
my
farm
too
for
on
whose
side
snorri
is
on
that
side
has
fallen
the
judgment
for
this
score
of
years
and
the
twists
of
the
law
are
too
hard
for
me
to
understand
since
meseems
right
hath
no
place
in
a
yet
i
will
defend
myself
as
i
may
then
on
the
morrow
the
althing
was
opened
and
the
four
quarter
courts
sat
in
their
places
and
the
fifth
court
sat
at
the
hill
of
laws
and
hiarandi
as
he
went
to
the
court
of
the
westfirthers
saw
where
einar
walked
also
thither
with
snorri
keeping
close
by
his
elbow
and
laughing
as
he
talked
ondott
also
was
there
slinking
behind
like
a
fox
and
on
that
very
first
day
hiarandi
case
was
called
early
now
einar
had
men
of
the
law
as
his
friends
and
they
had
taught
him
what
to
say
and
he
opened
the
case
speaking
loud
and
clearly
and
called
on
hiarandi
to
answer
the
charges
but
hiarandi
stood
up
alone
without
counsel
and
spoke
for
himself
soon
he
saw
that
the
case
went
against
him
for
einar
and
his
friends
knew
so
much
of
the
law
that
their
wiles
were
many
and
hiarandi
was
soon
confused
so
that
his
answers
were
not
wise
and
einar
smiled
where
he
stood
so
that
he
confused
hiarandi
the
more
then
einar
demanded
judgment
unless
hiarandi
had
more
to
say
and
he
was
about
to
give
up
his
case
then
came
some
one
and
stood
at
hiarandi
elbow
and
said
thou
shouldst
demand
a
stay
in
the
proceedings
hiarandi
looked
at
the
man
but
he
was
muffled
in
a
cloak
so
that
his
face
was
not
to
be
seen
then
hiarandi
asked
for
what
reason
can
i
ask
a
stay
the
man
replied
it
is
always
permitted
to
ask
it
to
get
counsel
but
hiarandi
said
no
counsel
can
save
me
here
let
an
end
come
now
foolish
art
thou
answered
the
man
dost
thou
forget
those
at
home
do
as
i
bid
then
hiarandi
asked
a
stay
and
it
was
granted
him
until
the
morrow
but
when
he
turned
to
ask
the
man
his
advice
he
was
gone
and
hiarandi
could
not
see
him
anywhere
then
he
went
to
beg
help
of
those
versed
in
the
law
but
they
said
he
should
have
come
sooner
for
they
were
now
too
busy
to
help
him
once
more
thinking
again
of
asdis
and
rolf
he
went
to
ask
help
of
snorri
the
priest
but
he
was
not
at
his
booth
and
men
said
he
would
be
at
the
courts
all
day
at
that
hiarandi
went
away
again
and
he
wandered
about
the
seeing
no
one
whom
he
could
ask
for
help
but
beholding
everywhere
men
too
busy
with
their
own
affairs
to
heed
him
at
last
toward
dusk
his
courage
forsook
him
once
more
and
he
went
and
sat
down
on
the
bank
of
the
river
believing
his
case
lost
as
he
sat
there
the
light
grew
dim
and
of
a
sudden
he
saw
at
his
side
the
man
muffled
in
the
cloak
now
is
seen
said
the
man
the
truth
of
the
old
saw
that
pleadeth
his
own
cause
hath
a
fool
for
his
client
for
a
sound
case
hadst
thou
but
it
is
ruined
beyond
remedy
what
should
i
have
done
asked
hiarandi
thou
shouldst
have
asked
aid
of
snorri
the
priest
but
he
said
hiarandi
has
been
in
talk
with
einar
who
sues
me
since
when
asked
the
man
has
snorri
been
used
to
pledge
himself
to
all
who
come
to
him
hast
thou
forgotten
he
is
of
thy
kin
we
are
both
come
said
hiarandi
from
the
stock
of
gisli
the
outlaw
but
if
gisli
was
his
uncle
so
also
was
gisli
the
slayer
of
his
father
so
snorri
is
both
against
us
and
for
us
by
the
tie
of
blood
and
he
forgetteth
and
remembereth
as
he
chooseth
or
as
his
interest
bids
then
said
the
man
thou
givest
him
no
good
character
yet
at
least
thou
couldst
have
let
him
have
the
say
which
way
his
interest
lies
but
hiarandi
answered
in
bitter
mood
snorri
casteth
his
weight
where
is
the
greater
power
that
his
own
strength
may
grow
he
would
not
thank
thee
should
he
hear
thee
answered
the
stranger
yet
methinks
that
even
in
matters
which
concern
his
own
advancement
he
should
be
free
to
choose
for
himself
now
asked
hiarandi
shall
i
go
to
snorri
and
crave
his
help
nay
replied
the
cowled
man
now
it
is
too
late
for
this
evening
snorri
holdeth
counsel
on
weighty
matters
concerning
chiefs
from
the
south
firths
who
are
to
meet
him
at
his
booth
why
then
asked
hiarandi
didst
thou
persuade
me
to
ask
a
stay
of
judgment
for
my
fate
meets
me
after
all
perhaps
even
i
said
the
man
know
more
of
the
law
than
thou
now
wilt
thou
be
ruled
by
me
that
i
will
answered
hiarandi
quickly
then
shalt
thou
do
thus
and
so
said
the
man
and
he
instructed
hiarandi
how
he
should
speak
on
the
next
day
and
this
shalt
thou
do
even
though
thou
seest
snorri
in
company
with
nay
make
no
question
for
else
thou
art
ruined
and
with
this
the
man
went
away
in
the
morning
all
men
go
to
the
courts
again
and
hiarandi
marks
how
einar
walks
with
snorri
and
they
seem
merry
together
though
einar
laughs
the
most
nevertheless
hiarandi
stands
up
when
his
case
is
called
and
does
as
the
cowled
man
had
said
for
he
demands
of
einar
what
forfeiture
he
will
name
either
said
einar
that
thou
shalt
pay
down
the
worth
of
three
hundreds
in
silver
or
that
thou
shalt
be
outlawed
now
said
hiarandi
it
seems
hard
that
so
much
shall
be
my
punishment
but
wilt
thou
take
this
offer
that
we
handsel
this
case
to
snorri
the
priest
and
abide
by
his
finding
einar
hesitated
but
many
standing
by
said
that
was
fair
moreover
that
was
a
custom
much
followed
and
again
einar
did
not
wish
the
outlawing
of
hiarandi
but
he
felt
sure
that
snorri
would
lay
a
which
must
force
hiarandi
to
sell
his
farm
and
he
thought
his
cause
was
sure
so
he
said
after
a
moment
i
will
so
they
handselled
the
suit
to
snorri
striking
hands
together
before
the
judges
and
agreeing
to
abide
by
his
decision
then
snorri
stood
up
to
speak
einar
smiled
at
him
that
he
might
remind
him
of
their
companionship
but
snorri
smiled
not
at
all
thus
it
seems
to
me
he
said
and
all
men
listened
while
he
spoke
for
snorri
was
one
of
those
who
had
known
the
great
men
of
old
time
who
had
seen
the
great
fight
at
the
althing
after
burning
and
who
had
swayed
its
event
thus
it
seems
to
me
said
snorri
the
case
of
hiarandi
was
a
good
one
at
the
beginning
yet
he
has
spoiled
it
but
the
case
of
einar
seems
strong
yet
it
is
weak
for
he
has
named
as
witnesses
two
men
of
kin
to
the
slain
man
also
he
has
not
called
a
man
who
is
nearer
neighbor
than
one
he
has
called
also
these
men
are
neither
landholders
nor
money
owners
nor
owners
of
sheep
or
cattle
but
they
live
in
einar
hall
at
his
expense
now
let
einar
say
if
all
these
things
are
not
true
then
einar
had
to
speak
and
he
acknowledged
that
his
witnesses
who
should
make
the
jury
were
chosen
as
snorri
had
said
then
snorri
set
those
men
out
of
the
jury
and
only
six
were
left
seven
men
are
needed
to
make
the
tale
of
the
witnesses
complete
quoth
snorri
therefore
it
is
plain
that
this
case
of
the
slaying
shall
fall
to
the
ground
and
no
atonement
shall
be
paid
but
as
to
the
case
of
the
striking
of
ondott
that
is
another
matter
and
it
is
a
case
of
contempt
of
the
thing
for
one
who
goes
to
serve
summons
in
a
suit
is
free
to
go
and
come
unscathed
and
is
under
the
protection
of
the
men
of
the
quarter
therefore
i
doom
hiarandi
to
the
lesser
outlawry
after
this
manner
he
shall
remain
upon
his
farm
for
the
space
of
one
year
nor
go
beyond
its
limits
more
than
the
length
of
a
bowshot
upon
penalty
of
full
outlawing
but
shall
he
become
a
full
outlaw
then
his
property
and
the
inheritance
of
his
son
is
not
to
be
forfeit
but
only
hiarandi
life
is
to
be
in
danger
and
such
is
my
finding
then
snorri
sat
him
down
then
men
murmured
together
discussing
the
judgment
and
all
said
that
he
knew
the
law
to
its
uttermost
quibble
and
he
knew
men
as
well
for
who
told
him
that
the
jury
was
wrongly
constituted
and
einar
was
wroth
complaining
that
snorri
was
tender
of
his
relative
but
hiarandi
was
glad
and
a
weight
fell
from
him
for
he
saw
how
he
had
been
saved
from
all
that
threatened
him
he
went
to
snorri
to
thank
him
snorri
took
his
thanks
and
smiled
at
hiarandi
now
is
clearly
seen
quoth
he
how
much
snorri
thinks
of
his
own
honor
and
how
little
of
that
of
his
kinsmen
hiarandi
had
nothing
to
answer
and
it
is
also
plain
said
snorri
how
i
always
favor
the
rich
but
care
nothing
for
poor
men
now
i
see
said
hiarandi
that
thou
wert
the
man
in
the
cloak
mayest
thou
perceive
as
well
responded
snorri
that
thou
hast
a
friend
in
the
world
who
will
help
thee
when
he
can
but
he
would
take
no
more
thanks
advising
hiarandi
to
go
home
and
set
his
affairs
in
order
since
from
the
rising
of
the
althing
to
its
next
sitting
he
must
not
quit
his
farm
and
take
heed
quoth
snorri
that
thou
losest
not
thy
life
from
carelessness
or
from
the
wiles
of
thine
enemies
then
hiarandi
betook
himself
home
chapter
viii
of
schemings
until
the
time
when
the
althing
must
rise
hiarandi
set
his
affairs
in
order
and
was
busy
thereat
he
arranged
who
should
buy
his
hay
and
who
should
supply
him
with
this
matter
and
that
although
it
was
clear
that
many
things
must
be
done
by
the
hands
of
rolf
also
frodi
the
smith
kinsman
of
the
was
to
come
to
cragness
whenever
he
might
thus
it
was
all
settled
and
when
the
althing
rose
then
hiarandi
withdrew
upon
his
farm
for
the
space
of
one
year
but
rolf
had
to
see
to
the
since
the
washing
was
best
done
beyond
the
farm
upon
common
land
also
the
selling
of
the
wool
came
to
rolf
lot
and
he
travelled
to
the
market
therewith
through
the
autumn
he
was
much
busied
with
his
father
matters
and
it
rejoiced
his
parents
that
the
lad
who
had
come
now
into
his
fifteenth
year
was
wise
and
foreseeing
and
looked
well
to
all
that
was
trusted
to
his
hand
then
the
winter
drew
nigh
and
the
hay
was
stored
and
the
time
came
when
the
sheep
must
be
gathered
from
their
summer
pastures
when
the
frosts
drove
them
down
from
the
uplands
all
men
met
at
the
great
which
the
father
of
hiarandi
had
built
but
hiarandi
might
not
be
there
because
the
fold
was
now
on
land
full
five
bowshots
from
the
boundaries
of
cragness
rolf
went
with
the
thralls
to
the
separating
of
the
sheep
by
means
of
their
marks
but
hiarandi
sat
at
home
looking
out
at
the
gathering
of
people
and
might
not
be
at
any
of
the
doings
now
ondott
crafty
had
oversight
of
einar
sheep
and
he
examined
the
sheep
and
said
whose
they
were
rolf
gave
to
the
thralls
the
sheep
to
drive
home
but
frodi
the
smith
who
was
the
mildest
of
men
took
the
sheep
from
the
hands
of
ondott
this
task
rolf
gave
to
frodi
because
he
would
not
himself
have
speech
with
ondott
who
was
now
well
of
his
broken
arm
but
whose
temper
was
not
improved
by
his
hurt
now
ondott
came
to
a
sheep
which
had
torn
its
ear
so
that
the
mark
was
scarred
then
said
ondott
this
sheep
is
einar
nay
said
frodi
i
remember
the
wether
and
he
is
hiarandi
looks
not
the
mark
asked
ondott
like
the
mark
of
einar
yes
said
frodi
but
the
mark
is
scarred
and
is
changed
now
quoth
ondott
call
hiarandi
hither
and
let
him
decide
this
he
said
with
a
sneer
but
frodi
answered
gravely
my
cousin
shall
not
break
his
outlawry
for
a
sheep
but
call
rolf
hither
i
call
no
boys
to
my
counsel
answered
ondott
the
matter
is
between
thee
and
me
then
frodi
was
perplexed
for
in
disputes
and
bargains
he
mixed
little
but
said
he
meseems
this
is
best
drive
the
sheep
to
cragness
and
let
hiarandi
see
it
now
said
ondott
i
have
no
time
for
that
but
draw
thy
whittle
and
we
can
settle
the
matter
here
then
frodi
looked
upon
his
long
knife
and
said
nothing
why
carriest
thou
the
whittle
then
asked
ondott
if
thou
art
not
ready
to
use
it
my
whittle
answered
frodi
is
to
cut
my
bread
and
cheese
and
to
mend
my
shoes
on
a
journey
then
all
the
men
who
stood
about
hooted
at
the
simple
answer
ondott
said
betake
thyself
then
to
bread
and
cheese
but
the
sheep
is
ours
and
he
sent
the
sheep
away
to
join
einar
flock
now
frodi
was
puzzled
and
he
said
i
will
not
follow
up
the
matter
but
will
pay
for
the
sheep
out
of
mine
own
savings
but
when
he
offered
to
pay
rolf
and
hiarandi
were
angered
for
the
wether
was
a
good
one
yet
they
could
get
no
satisfaction
from
einar
although
they
might
not
blame
frodi
knowing
his
peaceful
nature
now
as
the
winter
approached
came
chapmen
traders
into
the
neighborhood
and
laid
up
their
ship
near
cragness
and
all
men
went
to
chaffer
with
them
but
hiarandi
must
stay
at
home
then
for
company
sake
he
sent
and
bade
the
shipmaster
dwell
with
him
for
the
winter
but
ondott
crafty
learning
of
it
won
the
shipmaster
by
gifts
to
stay
with
einar
and
that
pleased
hiarandi
not
at
all
then
the
winter
came
and
men
had
little
to
do
so
they
held
on
the
ponds
yet
hiarandi
could
not
go
thither
and
the
life
began
to
irk
him
much
when
spring
drew
near
frodi
went
back
to
his
smithy
and
the
household
was
small
one
day
ondott
said
to
einar
still
we
sit
here
and
gaze
at
the
house
where
we
should
live
what
is
there
to
do
asked
einar
nothing
brings
hiarandi
from
his
farm
not
even
the
loss
of
his
wether
i
have
set
spies
to
watch
him
but
he
never
comes
beyond
the
brook
which
marks
his
boundary
yet
there
is
something
to
be
done
answered
ondott
wait
awhile
and
the
winter
passed
and
the
chapmen
began
to
dight
their
ship
for
the
outward
voyage
now
malcolm
the
scot
the
thrall
of
hiarandi
stood
often
on
the
crag
when
his
day
work
was
done
and
gazed
at
the
ship
of
the
chapmen
one
evening
ondott
went
thither
to
him
seeing
that
he
was
out
of
sight
of
the
hall
why
gazest
thou
asked
ondott
so
much
at
the
ship
wouldst
thou
go
in
her
aye
answered
the
thrall
for
she
goes
to
my
home
but
i
have
not
the
money
to
purchase
my
freedom
though
hiarandi
has
promised
in
another
year
to
set
me
free
wilt
thou
wait
another
year
when
thou
mightest
slip
away
now
cried
ondott
but
perhaps
thou
fearest
that
the
shipmaster
would
give
thee
up
that
also
said
the
thrall
was
in
my
mind
then
ondott
said
the
shipmaster
has
dwelt
with
us
the
winter
through
and
i
know
well
what
sort
of
man
he
is
now
i
promise
that
if
thou
comest
to
him
three
nights
hence
he
will
keep
thee
hidden
and
no
one
shall
see
thee
when
they
sail
in
the
morning
the
thrall
hesitated
but
in
the
end
he
did
as
ondott
desired
and
he
gained
his
freedom
by
the
trick
thus
was
the
work
at
cragness
rendered
harder
for
those
who
remained
and
frodi
could
not
come
to
help
hiarandi
said
ondott
to
einar
is
at
last
coming
into
those
straits
where
i
wished
him
now
be
thou
guided
by
me
and
i
promise
that
in
the
end
thy
wishes
will
be
fulfilled
come
we
will
go
to
cragness
as
before
and
make
offer
to
hiarandi
to
buy
his
land
and
he
persuaded
einar
to
go
they
went
as
before
with
hallvard
and
hallmund
shall
we
go
armed
asked
the
men
nay
answered
ondott
only
witnesses
do
i
desire
now
when
hiarandi
was
called
forth
by
einar
rolf
also
was
by
but
he
saw
that
they
of
fellstead
bore
no
arms
again
ondott
spoke
in
the
place
of
einar
hiarandi
said
he
all
men
can
see
what
fortune
is
thine
since
thy
thrall
has
left
thee
and
thy
work
is
harder
truly
thou
art
called
unlucky
but
einar
pities
thy
condition
and
he
offers
thus
take
from
him
a
smaller
farm
and
the
difference
in
silver
and
since
this
outlawry
is
from
us
from
the
time
ye
two
handsel
the
bargain
thou
art
free
to
go
where
thou
wilt
without
fear
of
thy
life
but
hiarandi
spoke
to
einar
and
not
to
ondott
why
comest
thou
hither
he
said
like
a
small
man
to
chaffer
over
little
things
this
outlawry
irks
me
not
and
in
two
months
i
am
free
to
go
where
i
wish
go
home
and
when
thou
comest
again
find
thy
tongue
and
speak
for
thyself
then
he
went
indoors
and
left
them
so
einar
and
those
others
rode
homeward
and
he
thought
his
journey
shameful
see
said
he
to
ondott
where
thy
counsels
have
brought
me
i
am
mocked
and
sent
away
now
ondott
replied
that
has
happened
which
i
desired
and
i
brought
men
to
hear
for
thou
hast
made
a
fair
offer
to
hiarandi
and
hast
shown
a
good
heart
now
what
happens
to
him
is
his
own
fault
and
no
man
can
blame
us
then
he
commanded
the
two
men
that
they
should
tell
everyone
what
had
been
said
showing
how
einar
had
been
generous
but
hiarandi
insulting
and
when
they
reached
the
house
ondott
said
to
einar
in
private
thou
shalt
see
that
hiarandi
hath
sown
the
seeds
of
his
own
destruction
leave
all
to
me
not
many
evenings
thereafter
ondott
put
himself
in
the
way
of
the
second
thrall
of
hiarandi
and
spoke
with
him
how
goes
all
at
cragness
asked
ondott
hard
said
the
thrall
for
we
are
at
the
spring
work
and
hiarandi
spares
not
himself
nor
me
either
and
the
work
is
heavy
since
my
fellow
is
gone
now
why
not
make
thy
lot
lighter
asked
ondott
by
taking
service
elsewhere
i
am
a
slave
said
the
man
and
not
a
servant
he
did
not
tell
that
his
freedom
had
been
promised
him
for
he
thought
that
time
far
away
since
it
was
three
years
for
hiarandi
had
the
custom
that
a
thrall
should
serve
with
him
not
for
life
but
for
only
seven
years
and
this
man
had
been
with
him
a
less
time
than
malcolm
the
life
of
a
thrall
said
ondott
is
very
hard
aye
said
the
man
yet
thy
fellow
went
away
quoth
ondott
aye
answered
the
thrall
but
he
fled
over
the
sea
no
ship
is
now
outward
bound
nor
is
there
anyone
to
hide
me
else
might
i
also
flee
come
to
einar
said
ondott
there
shalt
thou
be
safe
if
thou
sayest
true
answered
the
thrall
then
it
shall
be
done
but
thou
must
come
said
ondott
in
the
way
i
shall
name
thus
only
shalt
thou
be
of
service
to
einar
but
thou
shalt
be
well
rewarded
if
thou
showest
thyself
a
man
of
courage
who
will
not
dare
much
for
his
freedom
replied
the
thrall
but
is
harm
meant
to
hiarandi
that
is
not
thine
affair
quoth
ondott
then
for
a
time
they
spoke
together
and
certain
matters
were
agreed
upon
between
them
chapter
ix
of
the
outcome
of
ondott
plottings
now
spring
was
well
advanced
but
the
work
was
ever
hard
at
cragness
and
hiarandi
grew
very
weary
so
his
melancholy
gained
on
him
again
there
came
a
morning
when
he
was
troubled
in
his
demeanor
and
spoke
little
what
ails
thee
this
day
asked
asdis
of
him
now
said
hiarandi
for
all
my
words
to
einar
this
life
irks
terribly
better
to
be
an
outlaw
and
go
where
i
will
as
doth
grettir
the
strong
who
lives
secure
from
all
his
foes
asdis
answered
and
what
use
then
couldst
thou
be
to
thy
wife
and
son
and
is
not
the
time
short
enough
until
the
ban
leaves
thee
be
a
man
and
wait
with
patience
a
little
while
yet
yet
something
weighs
upon
me
pursued
hiarandi
for
last
night
i
dreamed
and
the
dream
forebodes
methought
i
was
working
in
the
field
and
i
left
my
work
and
my
land
some
good
reason
i
had
but
it
is
not
clear
to
me
now
i
did
not
go
a
beyond
the
boundary
but
from
behind
a
copse
wolves
sprang
out
and
fell
upon
me
as
they
tore
me
and
i
struggled
i
awoke
yet
the
fear
is
heavy
on
me
still
asdis
laughed
though
with
effort
and
quoth
she
now
take
thy
boat
and
fish
near
the
rocks
this
day
then
no
wolves
can
come
near
thee
nay
answered
hiarandi
how
canst
thou
ask
me
to
fish
when
so
much
must
be
done
on
the
farm
at
least
said
asdis
work
on
the
northern
slope
at
the
ploughing
and
away
from
the
boundary
the
frost
still
lies
there
in
the
earth
in
places
replied
hiarandi
but
on
the
south
slope
where
the
sun
lies
all
is
ploughed
and
we
must
seed
take
thy
sword
then
begged
asdis
and
have
it
at
thy
side
as
thou
workest
then
no
wolf
will
hurt
thee
but
hiarandi
answered
the
day
is
fine
and
the
wind
soft
the
sun
and
the
air
will
clear
my
head
and
we
will
laugh
at
this
at
i
will
take
no
sword
for
it
gets
in
the
way
then
he
called
the
thrall
and
rolf
and
they
took
the
bags
of
seed
and
went
out
to
work
now
that
was
a
fine
spring
day
so
fine
that
the
like
of
it
seldom
comes
old
farmers
in
broadfirth
still
call
such
a
day
a
day
of
hiarandi
weather
but
asdis
detained
rolf
and
spoke
to
him
earnestly
dreams
often
come
true
and
wolves
in
dreams
mean
death
see
i
will
lay
by
the
door
thy
father
sword
and
thy
bow
so
that
thou
canst
snatch
them
at
need
be
near
thy
father
this
day
for
i
fear
he
is
as
is
said
of
those
who
see
their
fate
and
avoid
it
not
and
watch
well
what
happens
so
rolf
stayed
near
his
father
all
that
morning
working
with
him
and
the
thrall
at
the
sowing
but
nothing
happened
and
the
sun
and
the
air
cleared
from
rolf
head
all
fear
of
ill
yet
hiarandi
was
still
gloomy
and
then
when
they
stopped
for
their
meal
at
noon
and
ate
it
as
they
sat
together
on
a
rock
rolf
spoke
to
hiarandi
trying
to
take
his
mind
from
himself
tell
me
he
begged
what
sort
of
man
is
that
outlaw
grettir
the
strong
and
for
what
is
he
outlawed
then
hiarandi
told
the
tale
and
as
he
spoke
he
grew
more
cheerful
grettir
said
he
is
the
strongest
man
that
ever
lived
in
iceland
and
no
three
men
can
master
him
for
he
himself
hath
said
that
he
hath
no
fear
of
three
nor
would
he
flee
from
four
but
with
five
he
would
not
fight
unless
he
must
all
his
life
he
has
been
rough
impatient
of
control
and
at
home
only
amid
struggles
and
slayings
yet
for
all
that
he
is
a
man
of
ill
luck
rather
than
misdeeds
for
he
hath
been
greatly
hated
and
provoked
and
it
is
great
harm
for
iceland
that
grettir
ever
was
outlawed
now
this
was
the
cause
of
his
outlawing
once
in
norway
grettir
lay
with
his
companions
and
they
had
had
much
ado
to
make
the
land
at
all
they
lay
under
the
lee
of
a
dyke
and
had
no
shelter
nor
wherewith
to
make
fire
and
the
weather
was
exceeding
cold
for
winter
was
nigh
then
night
came
on
and
they
feared
they
should
all
freeze
and
when
they
saw
lights
on
the
mainland
across
the
sound
they
desired
greatly
to
unmoor
their
ship
and
cross
but
dared
not
for
the
storm
then
grettir
to
save
the
lives
of
the
others
swam
the
sound
and
came
to
the
hall
where
those
lights
were
and
therein
people
were
feasting
then
he
went
into
the
hall
but
so
huge
is
he
and
so
covered
with
ice
were
his
clothes
and
hair
and
beard
that
those
in
the
hall
thought
him
a
troll
up
they
sprang
and
set
upon
him
and
some
snatched
firebrands
to
attack
him
for
no
weapons
will
bite
on
witch
or
troll
he
took
a
brand
and
warded
himself
and
won
his
way
out
but
not
before
fire
had
sprung
from
the
brands
to
the
straw
in
the
hall
and
he
swam
back
with
his
brand
to
his
companions
but
the
hall
burned
up
and
all
those
that
were
therein
now
there
were
burned
the
sons
of
a
man
powerful
here
in
iceland
and
for
that
deed
before
ever
he
returned
grettir
was
made
outlaw
because
of
the
injustice
he
would
not
go
away
for
his
three
years
but
stayed
here
nigh
sixteen
years
he
has
been
outlaw
now
and
lives
where
he
may
so
that
many
rue
his
outlawry
and
he
is
not
to
be
overcome
by
either
force
or
guile
great
deeds
moreover
he
has
done
in
laying
ghosts
that
walked
and
monsters
that
preyed
on
men
now
so
far
had
hiarandi
got
in
his
story
when
he
turned
to
the
thrall
who
sat
thereby
at
what
lookest
thou
man
nothing
answered
the
thrall
and
turned
his
face
another
way
methought
thou
wert
looking
and
signalling
with
the
hand
said
hiarandi
and
is
there
something
there
in
those
willows
on
land
what
didst
thou
see
nothing
answered
the
thrall
again
nevertheless
said
hiarandi
go
rolf
and
fetch
me
my
sword
for
i
repent
that
i
came
without
weapon
hither
now
rolf
had
seen
nothing
in
the
bushes
yet
he
went
for
the
sword
and
hastened
but
the
distance
was
two
furlongs
then
after
a
while
hiarandi
grew
weary
of
waiting
and
he
saw
nothing
at
all
in
the
willows
so
he
said
to
the
thrall
now
let
us
go
again
to
work
but
they
had
not
worked
long
when
the
thrall
looked
privily
and
he
saw
a
hand
wave
in
the
willows
then
he
cried
aloud
master
and
he
ran
toward
the
place
hiarandi
sprang
from
his
work
and
ran
after
the
thrall
now
the
land
at
that
place
lay
thus
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
was
that
brook
which
was
hiarandi
boundary
and
toward
the
sea
on
land
was
the
thicket
of
dwarf
willows
and
a
gnarled
oak
grew
at
a
place
away
from
the
willows
standing
alone
by
itself
so
when
rolf
came
from
the
hall
bearing
the
sword
and
having
also
his
bow
and
arrows
he
saw
the
thrall
fleeing
and
hiarandi
running
after
they
reached
the
brook
and
leaped
it
and
ran
on
hiarandi
pursuing
most
eagerly
the
thrall
ran
well
but
hiarandi
used
thought
for
he
turned
a
little
toward
the
clump
of
willows
and
cut
the
thrall
off
from
them
where
he
might
have
hidden
yet
he
might
not
catch
the
man
who
fled
past
the
oak
then
hiarandi
heard
the
voice
of
rolf
calling
him
to
stop
so
he
remembered
himself
and
stood
still
there
at
the
oak
and
turned
back
to
go
home
but
men
with
drawn
swords
started
up
out
of
the
willows
and
ran
at
hiarandi
he
leaped
to
the
tree
and
set
his
back
against
it
to
defend
himself
and
rolf
as
he
came
running
saw
how
the
men
fell
upon
his
father
the
lad
strung
his
bow
as
he
ran
and
leaped
the
brook
and
laid
an
arrow
on
the
string
when
he
was
within
killing
distance
he
sent
his
arrow
through
one
of
the
armed
men
then
that
struggle
around
hiarandi
suddenly
ceased
and
the
men
fled
in
all
directions
not
stopping
for
their
companion
but
one
of
them
carried
a
shaft
in
his
shoulder
and
a
third
bore
one
in
his
leg
and
then
rolf
saw
how
the
thrall
had
loitered
to
see
what
was
being
done
but
he
ran
again
when
the
men
fled
rolf
took
a
fourth
arrow
and
shot
at
the
slave
and
it
stood
in
the
spine
of
him
freedom
came
to
the
man
but
not
as
he
had
deemed
then
rolf
ran
to
his
father
who
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
he
looked
and
saw
that
hiarandi
was
dead
chapter
x
how
rolf
named
witnesses
for
the
death
of
hiarandi
it
happened
that
on
that
morning
frodi
the
smith
had
travelled
to
cragness
to
see
his
kinsmen
and
he
arrived
at
the
hour
of
misfortune
for
he
found
asdis
weeping
and
wringing
her
hands
by
the
door
of
the
hall
while
below
on
einar
land
rolf
stood
over
the
body
of
hiarandi
then
frodi
hastened
down
to
rolf
and
wept
aloud
when
he
came
there
when
he
could
speak
he
said
come
now
i
will
help
thee
bear
hiarandi
body
to
the
house
as
is
proper
but
rolf
had
stood
without
weeping
and
now
he
said
let
us
bear
him
only
to
our
own
land
for
a
nearer
duty
remains
than
burial
and
he
and
frodi
carried
hiarandi
across
the
brook
and
there
laid
him
down
and
asdis
covered
him
with
a
cloak
then
rolf
said
to
frodi
well
art
thou
come
who
art
my
only
kinsman
and
withal
the
strongest
man
in
broadfirth
dales
and
i
would
that
thou
hadst
with
thee
more
weapons
than
thy
whittle
art
thou
ready
frodi
to
help
me
in
my
feud
frodi
said
uneasily
a
man
of
peace
am
i
and
never
yet
have
drawn
man
blood
i
am
loth
to
bare
weapon
in
any
cause
and
meseems
thou
hast
no
feud
against
anyone
for
hiarandi
was
lawfully
slain
since
he
was
beyond
the
limit
which
snorri
set
that
is
to
be
seen
quoth
rolf
and
he
went
to
the
edge
of
the
brook
yonder
said
he
stands
the
tree
where
my
father
was
slain
and
no
step
went
he
beyond
it
and
that
tree
until
it
decayed
entirely
was
known
as
hiarandi
tree
now
see
said
rolf
if
i
can
throw
an
arrow
so
far
then
he
sent
an
arrow
and
it
fell
short
by
three
roods
and
the
second
shaft
went
but
two
yards
farther
so
that
fourteen
yards
more
were
needed
then
rolf
tried
again
and
put
all
his
skill
and
strength
into
the
effort
yet
the
arrow
fell
scarce
a
foot
beyond
the
second
rolf
dropped
the
bow
and
put
his
face
in
his
hands
i
can
not
do
it
groaned
he
it
is
impossible
to
any
man
said
frodi
he
gives
up
easily
answered
rolf
who
hath
no
heart
in
the
cause
yet
it
remains
to
be
seen
if
there
are
not
men
who
can
shoot
farther
than
i
try
thou
for
me
frodi
replied
i
am
strong
for
the
working
of
iron
and
the
lifting
of
weights
but
to
shoot
with
the
bow
is
another
matter
that
requires
skill
rather
than
strength
but
try
beseeched
rolf
so
frodi
tried
but
he
failed
lamentably
said
i
not
asked
he
that
i
was
not
able
and
now
i
say
this
that
by
all
thou
art
accounted
the
best
archer
in
the
district
for
last
winter
when
we
tried
archery
on
the
ice
and
all
did
their
uttermost
only
surt
of
ere
and
thord
of
laxriver
shot
farther
than
thou
and
that
by
not
so
much
as
a
rood
yet
thou
art
much
stronger
each
month
while
they
are
grown
men
and
their
strength
waxes
not
at
all
and
if
they
surpass
thee
by
no
more
than
a
rood
no
help
is
in
them
for
this
matter
rolf
knew
frodi
spoke
wisely
for
that
man
must
be
found
who
could
shoot
three
roods
farther
than
himself
but
he
said
would
i
were
the
weakest
in
all
broadfirth
dales
if
only
men
might
be
found
to
surpass
me
by
so
much
but
i
will
not
leave
this
matter
and
all
the
rest
shall
be
done
as
is
right
so
rolf
called
frodi
to
witness
that
the
man
whom
he
had
slain
well
known
to
them
both
was
a
man
of
einar
household
and
rolf
cast
earth
upon
his
face
as
a
sign
that
he
acknowledged
the
slaying
of
him
then
the
two
bore
the
body
of
hiarandi
to
the
hall
where
asdis
prepared
for
the
burial
but
frodi
and
rolf
went
forth
and
summoned
neighbors
men
of
property
who
were
not
kinsmen
of
einar
to
be
at
cragness
at
the
following
morning
twelve
men
were
summoned
and
the
did
no
more
on
that
day
but
at
fellstead
although
there
were
some
wounds
to
be
dressed
men
were
cheerful
for
hiarandi
was
gone
and
now
only
a
boy
stood
between
einar
and
the
owning
of
cragness
and
a
boy
would
be
easy
to
dispose
of
the
wounded
men
were
sent
out
of
the
way
that
they
might
not
be
accused
of
the
slaying
and
when
dark
came
ondott
sent
and
let
bring
the
body
of
the
man
that
was
slain
and
it
was
buried
secretly
then
he
and
einar
spoke
of
the
future
feeling
no
guilt
on
their
souls
since
all
had
been
done
lawfully
and
no
one
noted
how
the
old
woman
thurid
sat
in
a
corner
and
crooned
a
song
to
herself
now
these
were
the
words
of
her
song
a
tree
grows
and
threatens
woes
let
axes
chop
so
that
it
fall
let
fire
burn
its
branches
all
let
oxen
drag
its
roots
from
ground
let
earth
afresh
be
scattered
round
let
no
trace
stay
of
oaken
tree
so
shall
good
fortune
come
to
thee
but
if
the
tree
shall
stand
and
grow
then
comes
to
einar
grief
and
woe
yet
as
she
sat
muttering
the
song
to
herself
einar
went
by
and
bade
her
be
silent
for
he
was
going
to
sleep
then
she
sang
to
herself
to
sleep
some
day
to
weep
after
that
she
said
no
more
but
on
the
morrow
those
witnesses
whom
rolf
had
summoned
came
together
they
stood
at
hiarandi
side
as
the
custom
was
and
rolf
named
the
head
wound
and
the
body
wound
by
which
he
had
been
slain
then
they
went
to
the
place
of
the
slaying
they
viewed
the
tree
and
rolf
named
it
as
the
spot
to
which
hiarandi
went
farthest
and
he
called
on
those
men
to
witness
that
the
tree
stood
there
and
the
distance
was
measured
and
the
tree
was
put
under
the
protection
of
the
men
of
the
quarter
so
that
it
might
not
be
cut
thus
all
was
done
that
could
be
done
and
the
news
was
taken
to
fellstead
then
einar
said
to
ondott
where
were
thy
wits
had
we
last
night
destroyed
the
tree
and
smoothed
the
ground
no
trial
of
might
ever
be
made
now
we
may
be
proved
in
the
wrong
and
this
slaying
turn
against
us
ondott
had
nothing
to
say
save
that
no
man
could
shoot
that
distance
and
they
dared
not
now
cut
the
tree
that
night
hiarandi
was
laid
in
his
cairn
which
they
made
of
stones
by
the
edge
of
the
cliff
where
all
mariners
could
see
it
and
he
was
remembered
as
the
first
man
in
iceland
who
lighted
beacons
against
shipwreck
so
that
those
who
sailed
by
prayed
for
his
soul
chapter
xi
of
rolf
search
for
one
to
surpass
him
with
the
bow
two
vows
rolf
made
before
he
slept
that
night
the
first
was
that
he
would
yet
show
his
father
slaying
unlawful
the
second
was
that
so
long
as
he
might
he
would
neither
stand
sit
nor
lie
without
weapon
within
reach
of
his
hand
for
hiarandi
might
have
saved
himself
had
he
but
had
his
sword
asdis
and
frodi
who
stood
by
and
heard
the
vows
might
not
blame
him
for
such
was
the
custom
of
those
days
then
rolf
begged
frodi
to
stay
with
him
to
help
finish
the
sowing
and
that
was
done
and
when
the
spring
work
was
finished
on
the
farm
then
it
was
within
six
weeks
of
the
sitting
of
the
althing
but
rolf
felt
that
the
work
had
to
be
done
for
his
mother
sake
then
rolf
set
forth
on
that
quest
of
his
to
find
a
man
to
beat
him
at
the
bow
first
he
went
to
surt
of
ere
and
begged
him
to
try
skill
with
him
then
it
was
seen
that
rolf
strength
had
so
waxed
during
the
winter
that
surt
overshot
him
by
no
more
than
two
yards
next
rolf
went
to
thord
of
laxriver
but
that
failed
completely
for
by
now
rolf
could
shoot
even
as
far
as
thord
after
that
he
went
about
in
the
dales
to
find
men
who
were
good
at
archery
but
though
he
heard
of
many
with
great
names
those
men
proved
to
be
nothing
helpful
to
rolf
for
none
could
surpass
him
at
all
so
he
began
to
learn
how
much
is
a
little
distance
even
so
much
as
a
palm
breadth
at
the
end
of
a
race
or
of
the
fling
of
a
weapon
and
time
drew
on
toward
the
sitting
of
the
althing
so
that
rolf
feared
that
he
should
be
able
to
make
out
no
case
against
einar
at
last
after
wide
wanderings
he
got
himself
back
to
cragness
and
sat
wearily
at
home
for
three
days
with
little
to
say
or
to
do
that
third
morning
asdis
said
to
him
leave
my
son
thy
brooding
and
let
this
matter
rest
for
a
while
are
our
enemies
yet
mayhap
in
time
our
deliverance
will
come
rolf
answered
nothing
but
little
comes
to
those
who
seek
not
now
frodi
had
gone
for
one
night
to
his
smithy
which
was
ten
miles
from
cragness
beyond
helgafell
at
the
head
of
hvammfirth
where
there
was
a
ferry
by
a
little
river
when
he
came
back
quoth
he
yesterday
crossed
at
the
ferry
those
two
men
who
are
most
famous
in
all
the
south
firths
and
they
had
a
great
company
with
them
who
were
they
asked
rolf
at
once
and
what
kind
was
their
following
whether
or
not
were
they
answered
frodi
but
on
a
journey
of
peace
for
kari
and
flosi
were
on
their
way
to
visit
snorri
the
priest
at
his
hall
at
tongue
great
would
have
been
thy
pleasure
at
seeing
the
brave
array
now
would
i
had
been
there
cried
rolf
springing
up
but
i
would
have
looked
at
more
than
the
brave
array
so
farewell
mother
and
farewell
frodi
for
i
too
go
on
a
visit
to
snorri
the
priest
they
could
not
stay
him
he
took
food
and
a
cloak
with
his
bow
and
went
out
along
the
firth
on
that
long
journey
to
tongue
for
he
said
to
himself
that
in
that
company
or
nowhere
else
in
iceland
would
he
find
an
archer
to
shoot
for
him
too
long
is
it
to
tell
of
that
journey
but
it
was
shortened
inasmuch
as
fishermen
set
rolf
across
hvammfirth
then
he
went
from
hvamm
up
to
tongue
and
came
to
the
hall
of
snorri
the
priest
a
great
sight
was
that
hall
for
no
other
that
rolf
had
seen
was
equal
to
it
and
the
hall
at
cragness
might
have
been
set
inside
it
long
it
was
and
broad
wide
were
the
and
beautiful
the
pillars
that
flanked
them
men
went
in
and
out
carrying
necessaries
from
the
storehouse
which
stood
at
another
side
of
the
great
yard
and
so
noble
was
the
housekeeping
of
snorri
the
priest
that
at
first
rolf
feared
to
enter
the
hall
but
at
last
he
asked
a
servant
will
it
be
taken
well
if
i
enter
who
art
thou
asked
the
man
not
to
know
that
all
are
welcome
at
snorri
house
so
rolf
went
in
where
all
were
feasting
for
it
was
the
hour
of
the
noonday
meal
many
men
were
there
and
none
took
notice
of
rolf
save
that
when
he
sat
down
on
the
lowest
bench
one
came
and
offered
food
rolf
would
take
none
he
cast
his
eyes
about
the
place
where
twelve
fires
burned
along
the
middle
of
the
hall
where
were
seats
for
many
people
and
where
continually
servants
went
to
and
fro
all
seats
were
filled
save
one
or
two
but
at
the
further
end
of
the
hall
on
the
dais
sat
a
small
man
and
with
bright
eyes
of
a
light
blue
and
that
was
snorri
the
priest
the
greatest
man
in
all
the
west
of
iceland
at
his
sides
sat
two
other
men
the
one
to
his
right
was
bearded
and
strong
a
man
of
sixty
summers
and
to
the
left
sat
a
younger
man
with
no
gray
in
his
light
hair
slighter
in
body
and
yet
of
vigorous
frame
and
it
was
strange
that
those
two
men
sat
together
in
peace
who
once
had
been
the
bitterest
of
foes
for
the
older
was
who
had
burned
njal
in
his
house
but
the
other
was
kari
solmund
son
who
had
been
njal
and
alone
of
all
the
had
escaped
from
that
burning
and
his
vengeance
upon
the
burners
was
famous
for
he
followed
them
in
iceland
and
slew
many
and
great
was
his
part
in
the
fight
at
the
althing
as
may
be
read
in
njal
saga
but
when
the
burners
were
outlawed
and
fared
abroad
then
kari
followed
them
by
land
and
sea
and
slew
them
where
he
met
them
no
other
vengeance
is
like
to
that
which
kari
alone
took
for
his
own
son
and
for
njal
and
his
sons
grim
the
strong
and
helgi
the
gentle
and
skarphedinn
the
terrible
but
kari
missed
flosi
in
his
searchings
so
that
flosi
came
to
rome
and
was
absolved
from
the
sin
of
the
burning
and
so
journeyed
home
but
kari
came
also
to
rome
and
was
absolved
from
the
sin
of
his
vengeance
and
went
home
then
kari
was
wrecked
at
flosi
door
and
went
to
his
house
for
shelter
to
put
his
manhood
to
the
proof
but
flosi
welcomed
him
and
they
were
accorded
and
friends
they
were
thenceforth
now
all
this
tale
was
known
to
rolf
as
it
was
to
all
men
in
iceland
and
as
it
should
be
known
to
all
who
read
of
the
deeds
of
great
men
so
he
sat
and
marvelled
at
those
two
how
noble
they
looked
men
who
had
never
done
a
guileful
deed
and
in
that
they
were
different
from
snorri
who
had
won
his
place
by
craft
alone
rolf
looked
also
at
those
others
who
sat
by
the
dais
all
men
of
station
who
looked
like
warriors
some
one
of
whom
might
be
the
man
who
should
help
him
against
einar
and
he
took
great
courage
for
there
were
the
men
of
most
prowess
in
all
iceland
now
one
of
the
southfirthers
had
been
telling
a
story
of
grettir
the
outlaw
how
he
flogged
gisli
the
son
of
thorstein
with
birch
twigs
but
when
the
story
was
ended
snorri
said
mayhap
my
son
thorod
will
tell
us
what
he
knoweth
of
grettir
then
began
a
snickering
among
the
servingmen
and
those
of
tongue
looked
mighty
wise
but
thorod
snorri
son
got
up
from
his
seat
and
left
the
hall
saying
he
would
not
stay
to
be
laughed
at
when
he
was
gone
a
great
laughter
rose
so
that
flosi
asked
to
be
told
the
cause
of
it
snorri
said
this
will
show
all
how
grettir
has
wits
in
his
head
some
time
ago
i
was
wroth
with
my
son
for
he
seemed
to
me
not
manly
enough
so
i
sent
him
from
me
bidding
him
do
some
brave
deed
ere
he
returned
and
he
went
seeking
an
outlaw
to
slay
him
he
found
one
who
had
been
outlawed
for
an
assault
but
he
was
a
lad
and
the
woman
of
the
house
where
he
worked
sent
my
son
further
to
find
grettir
where
he
lurked
on
the
hillside
and
thorod
found
him
and
bade
him
fight
thou
not
asked
grettir
i
am
a
wherein
most
men
have
groped
with
little
luck
but
for
all
that
my
son
would
fight
so
he
smote
with
his
sword
but
grettir
warded
with
his
shield
and
would
not
strike
in
return
so
at
last
when
he
was
weary
of
such
doings
grettir
caught
up
thorod
and
sat
him
down
beside
him
and
said
thy
ways
now
foolish
fellow
before
i
lose
my
patience
with
thee
for
i
fear
thee
not
at
all
but
the
old
gray
carle
thy
father
i
fear
truly
who
with
his
counsels
hath
brought
most
men
to
their
knees
so
my
son
went
away
and
came
home
and
because
the
story
pleased
me
i
received
him
again
so
they
laughed
again
southfirthers
and
westfirthers
together
and
joyous
was
the
feast
but
when
all
was
quiet
again
men
saw
that
snorri
wished
to
speak
and
they
listened
snorri
called
his
steward
and
said
fetch
a
stool
and
set
it
here
on
the
dais
for
a
new
visitor
hath
come
to
see
me
then
the
steward
fetched
a
carved
stool
and
set
it
on
the
dais
he
put
a
cushion
in
it
and
threw
a
broidered
cloth
over
it
and
all
grew
curious
to
see
who
should
sit
on
that
stool
then
snorri
said
again
few
are
my
kindred
on
my
mother
side
and
not
in
many
years
hath
one
entered
this
hall
but
one
sits
here
whose
face
recalls
the
features
of
my
mother
thordisa
let
that
stranger
under
my
roof
who
claims
to
bear
the
blood
of
the
soursops
come
forward
to
me
rolf
arose
and
while
all
men
stared
at
him
he
walked
to
the
dais
and
stood
before
snorri
chapter
xii
of
the
trial
of
skill
at
tongue
snorri
asked
of
rolf
art
thou
the
son
of
hiarandi
my
kinsman
his
son
am
i
answered
rolf
so
must
thy
father
be
dead
said
snorri
for
i
feared
he
would
break
his
bounds
it
is
yet
to
be
proven
replied
rolf
whether
he
be
lawfully
slain
or
no
then
flosi
said
let
us
hear
this
tale
for
it
hath
not
yet
come
to
our
ears
sit
here
before
us
and
tell
what
hath
happened
so
rolf
sat
there
on
the
stool
which
had
been
prepared
and
he
told
his
story
all
who
sat
there
listened
and
the
men
of
the
south
firths
drew
up
close
it
was
a
new
thing
for
rolf
thus
to
speak
before
great
men
and
before
but
he
bore
himself
well
and
spoke
manfully
forbearing
to
complain
so
that
they
murmured
praise
of
him
and
it
seemed
to
them
wrong
that
he
had
been
so
treated
and
the
younger
men
grew
wroth
when
rolf
had
finished
telling
of
the
death
of
hiarandi
one
of
the
southfirthers
sprang
up
and
stood
before
the
dais
that
was
kolbein
the
son
of
flosi
and
he
asked
may
i
speak
what
is
in
my
mind
they
bade
him
speak
this
place
on
broadfirth
said
kolbein
is
not
so
far
out
of
our
way
when
we
journey
back
let
us
make
a
stop
there
and
pull
this
man
einar
out
of
his
house
and
so
deal
with
him
that
he
shall
do
no
evil
hereafter
this
he
said
with
fire
for
he
was
a
young
man
but
flosi
answered
now
is
seen
in
thee
the
great
fault
of
this
land
for
we
are
all
too
ready
to
proceed
unlawfully
and
men
can
know
by
me
how
violence
is
hard
repaid
all
knew
he
spoke
of
the
burning
and
of
that
vengeance
which
took
from
him
many
kinsmen
let
us
do
nothing
unlawful
what
sayest
thou
kari
then
kari
said
that
nothing
should
be
done
without
the
law
and
the
young
man
sat
down
again
but
kari
called
on
snorri
for
his
opinion
methinks
said
snorri
that
the
lad
hath
some
way
of
his
own
which
may
serve
if
that
is
all
answered
kari
then
we
will
help
him
it
is
only
said
rolf
that
one
of
you
here
will
shoot
with
the
bow
three
roods
farther
than
i
thus
can
my
father
death
be
proved
unlawful
and
einar
stand
punishable
with
great
eagerness
the
young
men
sprang
up
and
got
their
bows
all
said
they
would
do
their
best
to
help
the
lad
but
it
was
plain
that
they
regarded
the
matter
an
easy
one
so
rolf
took
heart
at
their
confidence
then
all
went
out
to
the
mead
where
was
good
space
for
shooting
but
first
said
kari
let
us
get
our
hand
in
with
shooting
at
a
mark
then
when
we
are
limber
we
will
shoot
to
show
our
distance
so
that
was
done
and
all
thought
that
great
sport
and
a
fine
opportunity
for
each
to
show
what
man
he
was
the
southfirthers
and
the
westfirthers
set
apples
on
sticks
and
shot
them
off
and
they
shot
next
at
the
sticks
themselves
and
last
they
shot
at
a
moving
mark
then
they
called
rolf
to
show
his
skill
flosi
asked
of
kari
thinkest
thou
the
lad
can
shoot
slender
is
he
answered
kari
but
strong
in
the
arms
and
back
and
his
eye
is
the
eye
of
an
eagle
our
young
men
will
not
find
their
task
easy
rolf
struck
the
apples
and
then
the
sticks
and
then
the
moving
mark
then
they
swung
a
hoop
on
the
end
of
a
pole
and
rolf
sent
his
arrow
through
it
but
most
of
the
others
failed
kari
laughed
ye
forget
quoth
he
that
the
lad
shoots
at
birds
and
can
not
afford
to
lose
his
arrows
who
among
us
hath
had
such
training
but
now
let
us
try
at
the
distance
so
the
ground
was
cleared
for
that
and
the
weaker
bowmen
shot
first
and
some
good
shots
were
made
rolf
was
called
upon
to
say
what
he
thought
he
shook
his
head
ye
must
do
better
he
said
then
better
bowmen
shot
all
those
who
were
there
except
kari
and
kolbein
snorri
would
not
shoot
but
flosi
did
and
a
great
honor
it
was
deemed
that
he
should
oblige
the
lad
but
when
all
had
finished
then
rolf
took
his
bow
and
his
arrow
fell
upon
the
farthest
which
had
been
sent
and
split
it
snorri
laughed
so
hath
my
kinsman
come
here
he
said
and
all
for
naught
but
kari
said
kolbein
and
i
have
yet
to
shoot
and
we
are
about
alike
in
skill
so
they
shot
one
after
the
other
and
they
shot
equally
so
far
that
all
were
pleased
and
some
ran
to
measure
the
distance
finding
it
three
roods
and
more
beyond
rolfs
arrow
many
cried
that
the
matter
was
now
settled
but
snorri
said
let
rolf
shoot
once
more
mayhap
he
hath
not
yet
done
his
best
then
rolf
took
his
bow
again
and
the
arrow
flew
it
fell
less
than
a
rood
behind
the
arrows
of
kari
and
kolbein
so
it
was
proved
that
none
there
might
help
rolf
in
his
need
then
he
was
greatly
cast
down
and
he
wished
to
go
away
at
once
but
they
detained
him
over
night
no
men
could
be
kinder
to
him
and
in
the
morning
when
he
was
to
start
home
they
offered
him
money
but
he
would
take
none
so
snorri
gave
him
a
cape
and
flosi
a
belt
and
kari
gave
a
short
sword
handsome
and
well
made
much
was
he
honored
by
those
gifts
snorri
lent
him
a
horse
to
take
him
to
hvamm
and
there
boatmen
set
him
again
across
the
firth
weary
and
disheartened
he
came
to
cragness
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
and
without
joy
he
entered
the
hall
there
asdis
met
him
in
great
trouble
here
has
been
said
she
a
great
man
and
a
rough
who
made
me
feed
him
misfortunes
come
to
us
from
all
sides
for
frodi
is
away
and
the
man
took
our
and
has
driven
it
away
before
him
going
toward
the
fells
when
was
he
here
asked
rolf
not
two
hours
ago
i
will
seek
him
said
the
lad
and
turned
from
the
house
nay
cried
asdis
in
alarm
i
beg
thee
go
not
for
he
was
huge
and
fierce
of
aspect
thou
art
too
tender
to
meet
such
as
he
put
up
with
this
matter
and
let
it
pass
mother
answered
rolf
i
am
sixteen
years
old
and
since
the
death
of
my
father
i
am
a
man
in
the
eye
of
the
law
wouldst
thou
have
me
less
than
a
man
in
fact
and
he
went
his
way
after
the
robber
chapter
xiii
of
that
robber
rolf
followed
that
man
who
had
stolen
the
ewe
and
the
way
led
first
down
into
the
dales
and
then
upward
to
the
fells
there
had
been
rain
and
the
paths
were
soft
so
that
the
tracks
of
man
and
sheep
were
clear
it
was
strange
to
rolf
that
the
robber
showed
such
boldness
as
to
go
on
beaten
ways
but
when
at
last
he
reached
the
region
where
all
the
paths
were
grassy
and
tracks
could
no
longer
be
seen
then
rolf
knew
not
what
to
do
until
he
met
a
wayfarer
hast
thou
seen
asked
rolf
one
who
goes
driving
a
ewe
he
is
not
far
before
thee
answered
the
man
but
what
seekest
thou
with
him
the
ewe
is
mine
said
rolf
i
will
have
it
again
thou
art
foolhardy
cried
the
man
a
life
is
more
than
a
sheep
turn
back
not
i
quoth
rolf
and
he
went
on
then
in
a
little
while
he
saw
the
man
before
him
going
without
haste
behind
the
ewe
and
rolf
marvelled
at
his
confidence
for
the
man
did
not
even
look
back
to
see
if
he
were
followed
so
rolf
strung
his
bow
and
went
faster
going
quietly
until
he
was
but
fifty
feet
behind
the
man
and
then
he
called
to
the
robber
that
man
turned
at
once
drawing
his
sword
grim
and
harsh
was
he
in
face
when
he
found
he
was
followed
but
when
he
saw
a
lad
alone
then
he
smiled
seekest
thou
me
he
asked
and
his
voice
was
harsh
like
his
face
so
that
he
was
a
man
to
terrify
many
that
sheep
is
mine
said
rolf
leave
it
and
go
thy
way
go
home
boy
said
the
man
i
would
not
hurt
thee
once
more
cried
rolf
i
bid
thee
leave
the
ewe
else
will
i
strive
with
thee
for
it
what
sneered
the
man
wilt
thou
set
thyself
against
me
draw
thy
sword
then
but
the
robber
sword
was
long
and
heavy
while
rolf
was
short
and
light
nay
he
responded
but
i
will
hurt
thee
with
my
arrows
take
thy
shield
and
defend
thyself
no
shield
do
i
need
sneered
the
man
again
against
such
as
thou
shoot
and
see
if
thou
canst
touch
me
so
great
was
his
contempt
that
he
stung
rolf
to
the
quick
let
us
see
then
the
lad
cried
and
in
great
heat
of
anger
at
short
range
rolf
drove
a
shaft
at
the
middle
of
the
man
body
but
behold
the
man
swung
his
heavy
sword
as
lightly
as
a
wand
and
brushed
the
arrow
aside
once
more
quoth
he
and
then
rolf
shot
again
and
yet
again
but
each
time
the
arrow
was
swept
aside
and
the
robber
called
with
jeers
to
shoot
faster
so
rolf
sent
his
shafts
as
swiftly
as
he
could
and
it
was
astonishing
to
see
how
fast
they
followed
each
other
but
though
he
shot
half
a
score
of
times
each
arrow
just
as
it
reached
its
mark
was
brushed
aside
of
them
all
one
touched
the
clothing
on
the
robber
breast
so
that
it
tore
the
cloth
and
one
sent
at
the
face
scratched
the
skin
ere
it
was
turned
when
that
was
done
the
man
jeered
no
more
for
he
saw
that
rolf
was
closing
in
and
what
might
have
happened
is
not
known
but
to
rolf
even
in
his
anger
to
be
so
foiled
there
came
admiration
of
the
stranger
skill
now
he
thought
such
a
thing
is
a
marvel
for
it
is
related
of
the
men
of
old
time
but
not
of
the
men
of
i
had
not
deemed
anyone
so
quick
or
so
strong
then
his
own
words
told
him
who
the
man
must
be
he
stopped
advancing
and
lowered
his
bow
but
in
a
twinkle
the
man
dropped
his
sword
and
strung
his
own
bow
and
he
laid
an
arrow
on
the
string
now
cried
he
we
have
changed
about
and
can
play
the
game
the
other
way
perhaps
thou
also
canst
guard
thyself
he
drew
the
bow
art
thou
minded
to
try
rolf
made
no
movement
to
ward
himself
thou
art
grettir
the
strong
he
said
grettir
asmund
son
am
i
answered
the
man
whom
men
call
grettir
the
strong
perhaps
thou
art
now
the
more
minded
to
slay
me
even
as
fools
whom
i
meet
from
time
to
time
for
nine
hundreds
in
silver
is
the
price
set
upon
my
head
nay
answered
rolf
i
would
not
slay
thee
the
man
laughed
mightily
i
owe
my
life
to
thee
he
cried
then
he
changed
his
manner
suddenly
go
leave
me
boy
for
my
temper
is
short
and
i
might
do
thee
a
mischief
and
then
he
went
on
his
way
still
driving
the
ewe
before
him
but
rolf
remained
in
that
place
after
a
time
the
lad
gathered
those
of
his
arrows
which
were
not
broken
and
turned
back
toward
his
home
but
when
he
looked
behind
and
saw
that
a
roll
of
land
hid
him
from
grettir
then
he
turned
again
and
followed
after
the
outlaw
a
long
time
rolf
followed
warily
at
first
for
grettir
looked
back
once
or
twice
then
the
lad
might
go
more
boldly
and
the
outlaw
led
him
up
into
the
hills
where
were
rocks
and
crags
and
much
barrenness
a
region
where
men
might
lurk
long
and
not
be
found
and
grettir
made
a
halt
at
a
strong
place
a
shelf
on
the
crags
protected
from
above
by
a
sheer
cliff
and
reached
only
from
one
side
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
often
been
there
before
while
he
made
a
fire
rolf
lay
at
a
distance
and
wondered
how
he
might
steal
nigher
only
one
vantage
did
he
see
which
commanded
the
outlaw
lair
a
great
spur
of
rock
which
stood
out
from
the
cliff
but
which
it
would
be
hard
to
reach
then
grettir
laid
himself
to
sleep
while
it
was
yet
day
and
rolf
crept
forward
till
he
was
under
the
spur
from
above
no
man
might
reach
it
yet
there
were
crevices
here
and
there
in
the
rock
by
which
rolf
could
climb
so
he
slung
his
bow
on
his
back
and
tried
the
ascent
but
so
slow
must
he
climb
for
fear
of
noise
that
it
was
dark
when
he
reached
the
flat
top
and
though
grettir
was
scarce
forty
feet
away
rolf
could
not
see
him
at
all
so
he
watched
there
through
the
night
ever
at
that
little
distance
he
heard
grettir
labor
in
his
sleep
and
oft
the
outlaw
moaned
and
groaned
at
times
he
started
up
and
looked
abroad
but
he
could
see
nothing
by
the
light
of
the
stars
but
when
dawn
came
then
grettir
slept
peacefully
and
when
it
was
broad
day
he
still
lay
sleeping
his
face
in
sleep
was
sad
and
noble
with
signs
of
a
hasty
temper
his
frame
was
great
indeed
he
lay
so
long
that
rolf
at
last
strung
his
bow
and
shot
an
arrow
into
the
ground
by
him
grettir
started
from
his
sleep
grasping
his
weapons
and
looking
about
for
his
foes
never
in
his
life
rolf
forgot
that
sight
which
few
men
had
seen
without
ruing
it
of
grettir
angry
and
ready
for
the
fray
but
grettir
saw
no
one
for
he
looked
about
on
the
hillside
below
him
then
rolf
spoke
here
am
i
grettir
then
the
outlaw
saw
him
and
put
up
his
shield
against
a
second
arrow
rolf
said
had
i
wished
i
could
have
slain
thee
in
thy
sleep
rather
will
i
believe
answered
grettir
that
thou
hast
shot
thy
last
arrow
and
missed
rolf
showed
him
his
full
quiver
and
grettir
lowered
his
shield
how
camest
thou
here
he
asked
i
made
sure
that
thou
wert
gone
not
very
sure
answered
rolf
and
how
asked
grettir
didst
thou
reach
that
place
i
had
weened
no
man
could
mount
that
rock
i
am
but
a
boy
answered
rolf
yet
men
call
me
cragsman
now
i
am
well
shamed
cried
grettir
that
a
boy
hath
so
outwitted
me
and
this
i
believe
that
thou
mightest
have
slain
me
for
a
good
archer
i
found
thee
yesterday
still
more
will
i
say
that
yesterday
i
had
near
suffered
a
hurt
at
thy
hands
so
that
i
was
considering
whether
to
retreat
before
thee
or
to
take
my
shield
and
neither
have
i
yet
done
before
a
single
archer
now
let
me
ask
thee
why
didst
thou
stop
shooting
then
and
why
didst
thou
not
slay
me
here
as
i
lay
because
answered
rolf
thou
or
no
man
in
iceland
canst
give
me
the
help
i
need
come
down
said
grettir
and
we
will
eat
together
so
they
breakfasted
together
of
dried
meat
and
the
milk
of
the
ewe
how
was
thy
sleep
there
on
the
crag
asked
grettir
no
worse
answered
rolf
than
thine
here
on
the
ledge
why
didst
thou
sleep
so
ill
then
grettir
answered
soberly
one
of
my
few
good
deeds
is
so
repaid
that
i
see
shapes
in
the
dark
and
my
sleep
is
broken
for
i
slew
glam
the
ghost
who
wasted
thorhallstead
but
ere
i
cut
off
his
head
he
laid
on
me
that
spell
so
i
am
a
fearsome
man
in
the
dark
though
in
the
day
no
man
may
daunt
me
but
what
can
i
do
for
thee
let
me
see
answered
rolf
if
with
the
bow
thou
canst
shoot
farther
than
i
thou
art
a
vain
lad
said
grettir
somewhat
displeased
for
that
alone
earnest
thou
hither
be
not
wroth
begged
rolf
for
i
have
the
best
of
reasons
and
he
told
the
story
of
his
father
death
and
of
the
need
for
a
good
archer
grettir
smiled
and
couldst
thou
find
no
man
asked
he
who
is
within
the
law
to
do
this
for
thee
then
rolf
told
of
the
trial
with
those
southfirthers
at
tongue
and
grettir
looked
upon
him
with
surprise
so
skilled
art
thou
then
he
asked
now
string
thy
bow
and
show
me
how
far
thou
canst
shoot
so
rolf
strung
his
bow
and
shot
along
the
hillside
and
the
arrow
fell
far
away
now
do
i
wonder
said
grettir
let
me
see
thy
bow
and
when
he
had
looked
on
it
he
said
that
any
one
could
shoot
so
far
with
such
light
gear
i
had
not
thought
possible
thou
art
a
good
bowman
but
what
thinkest
thou
of
my
bow
rolf
took
the
bow
of
grettir
in
his
hand
and
a
strange
weapon
it
was
for
it
was
shorter
than
his
own
bow
and
scarcely
shaped
at
all
but
was
heavy
and
thick
so
that
it
had
seemed
not
to
be
a
bow
save
for
the
string
and
the
notched
ends
such
a
bow
said
rolf
saw
i
never
canst
thou
string
it
asked
grettir
then
rolf
tried
but
he
could
scarce
bend
it
a
little
way
yet
grettir
took
it
and
strung
it
with
ease
then
he
showed
rolf
his
arrows
which
were
heavy
short
and
thick
like
the
bow
he
laid
one
on
the
string
and
drew
it
to
the
head
and
behold
it
rushed
forth
with
a
great
whir
and
with
such
force
that
it
might
pierce
a
man
behind
his
shield
and
it
flew
far
beyond
the
arrow
of
rolf
full
five
rood
further
what
thou
dost
with
skill
said
grettir
i
do
with
strength
but
rolf
cried
with
great
joy
thou
art
the
man
i
have
been
seeking
then
he
asked
wilt
thou
go
with
me
and
shoot
an
arrow
before
witnesses
to
prove
that
my
father
was
unlawfully
slain
that
i
will
quoth
grettir
and
joyfully
too
for
i
see
little
of
men
only
one
thing
i
require
that
safe
conduct
be
promised
me
to
go
and
come
for
i
have
enemies
in
thy
dales
how
shall
i
get
thee
safe
conduct
asked
rolf
it
must
be
granted
answered
grettir
by
the
quarter
court
at
the
althing
then
they
talked
the
matter
over
and
grettir
advised
rolf
once
more
to
seek
snorri
the
priest
to
find
what
steps
should
be
taken
then
it
was
bespoken
where
rolf
should
meet
grettir
again
and
the
outlaw
offered
to
lay
out
in
the
hills
north
of
the
thingvalla
in
the
valley
of
the
geysirs
and
await
tidings
of
the
outcome
of
the
suit
now
said
rolf
when
he
was
ready
to
go
keep
the
ewe
for
thy
kindness
sake
do
thou
take
her
answered
grettir
for
had
i
known
that
thy
mother
was
a
widow
i
would
never
have
taken
the
sheep
and
the
first
booty
is
this
which
ever
i
rendered
again
so
rolf
returned
toward
home
driving
the
ewe
and
when
he
reached
the
highway
which
led
to
the
south
firths
there
came
riding
a
company
kari
and
flosi
and
their
followers
and
snorri
the
priest
was
with
them
they
asked
tidings
then
he
told
them
of
grettir
and
those
three
chiefs
left
their
horses
and
sat
down
with
rolf
on
the
fell
a
little
way
from
their
company
they
had
talk
what
was
to
be
done
for
snorri
declared
he
saw
a
flaw
in
the
case
since
grettir
was
an
outlaw
and
no
outlaw
had
ever
yet
come
into
a
suit
at
law
but
at
last
he
said
now
go
thy
way
and
summon
einar
with
a
formal
summons
and
he
taught
rolf
the
form
but
be
thou
sure
that
no
mention
is
made
of
grettir
and
i
believe
that
since
no
such
case
has
ever
yet
been
tried
it
can
lawfully
be
brought
about
that
grettir
may
shoot
then
those
chiefs
went
their
way
and
rolf
went
his
and
he
came
back
to
cragness
chapter
xiv
how
rolf
and
einar
summoned
each
other
because
of
the
state
of
matters
at
cragness
frodi
the
smith
journeyed
there
frequently
to
see
his
relatives
here
it
must
be
told
what
kind
of
man
he
was
he
was
tall
and
with
a
long
neck
and
a
long
face
and
somewhat
comic
to
look
upon
frodi
the
slow
was
he
for
his
movements
were
cumbersome
and
his
mind
worked
slowly
but
since
that
affair
at
the
many
called
him
now
rolf
sends
for
him
one
day
and
tells
him
all
that
had
happened
and
how
he
was
sure
of
making
einar
an
outlaw
and
he
asks
frodi
to
go
with
him
to
the
house
of
einar
to
be
witness
to
the
summons
then
said
frodi
let
me
say
what
i
think
of
this
affair
first
thou
shouldst
ask
a
peaceful
atonement
for
in
the
beginning
it
seems
that
there
is
danger
to
thee
so
great
is
the
strength
against
thee
and
in
the
second
place
such
continual
as
daily
go
on
are
unchristian
and
evil
for
the
land
then
rolf
was
thoughtful
shall
i
have
done
all
my
seeking
for
nothing
he
asked
more
than
that
shall
i
take
money
for
my
father
slaying
it
is
the
custom
of
the
land
said
frodi
and
many
men
do
it
for
the
sake
of
peace
i
heard
flosi
say
at
tongue
said
rolf
how
strife
between
neighbors
was
the
greatest
bane
of
this
land
and
i
am
half
minded
to
do
as
thou
sayest
but
why
has
not
einar
offered
me
atonement
if
any
is
to
be
paid
i
tell
thee
hard
is
his
heart
and
he
is
glad
at
least
begged
frodi
let
me
ask
einar
what
he
will
do
so
i
will
answered
rolf
and
a
great
sacrifice
i
make
to
lay
aside
my
grief
and
vengeance
nay
i
even
break
my
vow
which
i
made
before
thee
but
i
think
only
scorn
will
be
thy
portion
and
matters
will
be
made
worse
then
they
went
together
to
the
house
of
einar
and
were
seen
from
the
hall
as
they
entered
the
yard
and
men
came
and
stood
in
the
porch
as
they
approached
there
were
einar
and
ondott
and
other
men
of
the
household
all
bore
weapons
but
no
one
spoke
when
the
cousins
stood
before
them
will
no
one
here
give
us
welcome
asked
frodi
ondott
mimicked
frodi
slow
voice
and
said
be
welcome
the
men
of
einar
laughed
laugh
not
said
frodi
mildly
now
einar
it
is
known
how
hiarandi
came
by
his
death
and
men
say
thou
art
responsible
therefor
i
was
not
by
at
his
slaying
answered
einar
said
rolf
what
is
done
by
a
man
servants
with
his
knowledge
is
as
his
deed
and
frodi
said
were
it
not
better
to
atone
rolf
for
the
death
of
his
father
rather
than
have
bad
blood
between
neighbors
for
thou
knowest
this
that
some
day
a
man
may
be
found
to
shoot
an
arrow
beyond
that
little
oak
now
einar
was
plainly
smitten
by
the
answer
of
frodi
and
the
scorn
went
from
his
face
and
he
thought
and
here
may
be
seen
how
the
evil
which
a
bad
man
does
is
not
half
so
much
in
quantity
as
the
good
which
he
mars
for
ondott
crafty
saw
what
was
in
einar
mind
and
he
spoke
quickly
an
award
may
be
given
einar
said
he
which
will
honor
you
both
shall
i
utter
it
now
einar
was
accustomed
to
the
bitter
jokes
of
ondott
and
when
he
thought
he
saw
one
coming
he
forgot
his
design
of
peace
and
said
utter
the
award
but
does
rolf
agree
to
it
asked
ondott
i
will
hear
it
answered
rolf
but
if
thou
meanest
to
scoff
think
twice
lest
in
the
end
it
be
bad
for
thee
meanwhile
some
of
the
women
of
the
household
had
come
out
of
the
hall
at
its
other
end
by
the
women
door
and
now
stood
near
to
hear
what
was
said
helga
the
daughter
of
einar
was
there
but
she
hung
back
nearest
of
all
stood
thurid
the
crone
listening
closely
now
this
i
would
award
said
ondott
if
i
were
in
thy
place
einar
thy
son
grani
is
abroad
in
the
fostering
of
the
orkney
earl
but
some
day
he
will
come
home
and
then
will
need
men
to
serve
him
let
rolf
give
up
his
holding
and
become
thy
man
so
canst
thou
protect
him
from
all
harm
then
when
thy
son
returns
rolf
shall
be
his
and
shall
be
atoned
by
the
honor
for
the
death
of
his
father
some
laughed
but
not
for
long
and
so
far
was
this
from
a
jest
that
the
most
were
silent
then
thurid
chanted
for
einar
son
shall
rolf
bear
bow
which
in
the
end
shall
bear
most
woe
but
none
paid
attention
for
rolf
was
gathering
himself
to
speak
and
he
cried
ill
jesting
is
thine
ondott
now
hear
what
i
am
come
hither
to
say
outlaw
shall
einar
be
made
for
that
man
is
found
who
can
make
the
shot
beyond
the
little
oak
and
thus
i
summon
einar
so
he
recited
the
summons
he
named
the
deed
and
the
place
and
the
wounds
of
which
hiarandi
had
died
he
named
witnesses
those
householders
who
had
already
been
summoned
and
he
called
einar
to
answer
for
the
deed
before
the
westfirther
court
at
the
althing
ondott
alone
laughed
when
the
summons
was
spoken
in
full
so
here
are
come
a
boy
and
a
peaceling
quoth
he
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
men
heed
him
not
said
frodi
to
rolf
for
he
seeks
cause
to
draw
sword
on
thee
then
rolf
made
no
answer
to
ondott
but
he
and
frodi
turned
away
and
started
to
go
home
ondott
whispered
to
einar
a
spear
between
the
shoulders
will
settle
this
matter
for
good
and
he
signed
to
hallvard
that
he
should
have
his
spear
ready
to
throw
einar
stood
irresolute
but
the
maid
helga
went
forward
quickly
and
walked
by
rolf
side
may
i
go
with
thee
to
the
gate
she
asked
great
anger
possessed
him
against
all
of
einar
house
but
the
sight
of
her
astonished
him
and
he
said
she
might
come
in
silence
they
went
to
the
gate
of
the
yard
then
helga
stood
there
in
the
way
while
those
two
from
cragness
went
homeward
and
einar
had
already
bidden
that
no
violence
be
done
for
fear
of
harming
his
daughter
he
went
into
the
hall
and
sat
down
in
his
seat
brooding
over
the
outcome
ondott
said
too
squeamish
art
thou
einar
said
if
thou
findest
me
not
a
way
out
of
this
it
will
go
ill
with
thee
now
a
way
out
of
that
would
have
been
hard
to
find
had
not
one
day
ondott
met
that
man
who
had
set
rolf
on
the
right
road
as
he
pursued
grettir
said
the
man
so
thy
neighbor
rolf
won
his
sheep
again
from
grettir
the
strong
that
was
a
great
deed
then
ondott
learned
of
the
stealing
of
the
sheep
and
how
rolf
had
been
seen
driving
it
home
again
he
thought
and
knew
who
must
be
that
man
who
would
shoot
for
rolf
then
he
went
homeward
with
a
light
heart
now
said
he
to
einar
thy
defence
is
sure
but
come
with
me
and
we
will
summon
rolf
for
those
wounds
he
dealt
and
that
man
he
slew
when
hiarandi
was
slain
no
court
answered
einar
will
punish
rolf
for
that
and
he
would
not
go
though
he
gave
ondott
permission
to
go
in
his
stead
ondott
took
a
witness
and
went
to
cragness
where
rolf
and
frodi
were
at
work
in
the
yard
ondott
recited
the
summons
rolf
and
frodi
went
on
with
the
work
and
answered
naught
and
now
all
is
quiet
until
men
ride
to
the
althing
chapter
xv
of
suits
at
the
althing
rolf
journeyed
to
the
althing
and
as
he
went
he
fell
in
with
the
company
of
snorri
the
priest
and
travelled
with
them
snorri
heard
how
the
summons
had
gone
and
he
asked
whether
rolf
had
said
anything
of
grettir
rolf
answered
that
he
had
not
then
he
told
of
the
summons
which
ondott
had
made
and
snorri
laughed
it
was
not
many
days
before
they
came
to
the
thingvalla
and
rolf
saw
that
great
wonder
of
iceland
for
from
the
plain
on
which
they
journeyed
a
large
part
had
fallen
clean
away
many
yards
down
and
it
lay
below
like
the
bottom
of
a
pan
the
great
rift
was
the
name
of
the
western
precipice
and
there
was
no
way
down
save
by
one
steep
path
snorri
had
held
that
path
on
the
day
of
the
battle
at
the
althing
nor
would
he
let
flosi
and
the
burners
escape
that
way
when
rolf
had
got
down
to
the
plain
he
saw
all
the
booths
for
the
lodging
of
those
who
came
to
the
althing
ranged
along
the
river
he
saw
the
places
where
the
quarter
courts
were
held
and
he
went
to
the
hill
of
laws
where
the
fifth
court
sat
to
hear
appeals
now
the
hill
of
laws
is
cut
off
from
the
plain
by
deep
rifts
and
men
showed
rolf
where
to
save
his
life
flosi
had
leaped
one
rift
at
its
narrowest
part
and
that
was
a
great
deed
other
wonders
were
to
be
seen
then
on
the
second
day
the
sitting
of
the
courts
began
and
rolf
watched
closely
for
the
calling
of
his
suit
but
that
came
not
until
the
sitting
was
near
its
end
now
snorri
conducted
the
case
of
rolf
and
all
went
in
due
order
einar
answered
what
was
said
against
him
that
he
was
not
present
at
the
slaying
of
hiarandi
snorri
called
on
the
court
to
say
whether
einar
were
not
answerable
because
his
men
did
the
deed
the
judges
said
he
was
then
it
came
to
proving
whether
or
not
the
slaying
were
illegal
and
snorri
said
that
a
man
had
been
found
who
could
shoot
the
distance
and
this
he
asked
of
the
judges
is
it
not
true
that
when
before
witnesses
an
arrow
is
shot
from
the
boundary
and
falls
beyond
the
tree
that
will
prove
the
slaying
unlawful
that
is
so
said
the
judges
now
say
further
demanded
snorri
is
it
not
true
that
in
the
moment
when
the
slaying
is
proved
unlawful
the
guilt
of
einar
is
established
so
that
no
suit
at
law
is
needed
that
also
is
true
answered
the
judges
now
said
snorri
one
last
thing
do
i
ask
whether
or
not
he
who
goes
to
make
the
proof
by
shooting
an
arrow
may
go
and
come
freely
whatsoever
man
he
be
we
see
no
reason
why
this
may
not
be
so
said
the
judges
now
give
that
decision
here
aloud
in
the
open
court
required
snorri
but
einar
arose
and
said
one
exception
only
shall
i
ask
to
this
that
no
outlaw
be
allowed
to
take
part
in
this
suit
by
shooting
the
arrow
then
said
snorri
to
rolf
they
have
learned
of
grettir
he
said
to
the
judges
well
do
i
know
that
no
outlaw
is
ever
allowed
to
give
witness
in
court
nor
to
sit
on
juries
but
no
such
case
as
this
has
ever
arisen
and
it
seems
to
me
that
an
outlaw
might
be
permitted
to
shoot
then
there
was
great
talking
on
both
sides
for
the
greater
part
of
an
hour
it
would
be
tedious
to
tell
what
was
said
but
the
end
was
that
the
judges
were
divided
so
the
question
was
referred
to
the
lawman
and
his
answer
was
that
no
outlaw
might
take
part
in
a
law
matter
in
any
way
whatsoever
there
was
an
end
to
rolf
hopes
to
prove
einar
guilty
by
the
means
of
grettir
but
snorri
called
all
men
to
witness
that
when
some
day
a
man
might
be
found
to
shoot
the
distance
then
einar
was
guilty
without
going
to
law
now
men
began
to
whisper
and
say
that
the
end
of
outlawry
was
but
four
years
off
and
then
rolf
could
be
justified
so
einar
tried
to
have
a
limit
of
three
years
set
on
that
time
when
it
was
lawful
to
try
the
shooting
but
snorri
strove
mightily
against
that
and
that
question
went
to
the
lawman
and
he
said
that
seven
years
should
be
the
limit
that
was
the
end
of
the
suit
and
rolf
got
no
satisfaction
at
all
one
more
thing
was
done
on
that
day
for
snorri
went
to
einar
where
he
stood
with
ondott
and
he
asked
of
the
second
suit
for
which
rolf
had
been
summoned
ondott
spoke
for
einar
we
shall
not
bring
that
suit
that
is
well
said
snorri
for
ye
had
no
case
and
i
could
have
a
fine
laid
on
you
if
the
case
was
brought
falsely
then
he
took
rolf
with
him
to
his
booth
but
here
is
the
trick
which
ondott
had
prepared
for
the
next
day
was
the
last
of
the
sittings
and
snorri
was
busy
with
many
matters
but
rolf
stayed
at
the
booth
much
cast
down
then
toward
the
sunset
hour
the
cases
were
all
finished
and
men
left
the
courts
all
save
the
judges
who
stayed
for
the
formal
closing
then
ondott
brought
forward
the
case
against
rolf
and
summoned
him
into
court
but
no
one
was
there
to
tell
either
snorri
or
the
lad
nevertheless
it
was
the
law
that
the
suit
might
go
on
because
lawful
summons
had
been
given
and
einar
stood
up
and
said
i
take
witness
to
this
that
i
give
notice
of
a
suit
against
rolf
hiarandi
son
in
that
he
slew
by
a
body
wound
by
an
arrow
my
herdsman
thorold
i
say
that
in
this
suit
he
ought
to
be
made
a
guilty
man
an
outlaw
not
to
be
fed
not
to
be
forwarded
not
to
be
helped
or
harbored
in
any
need
i
say
that
all
his
goods
are
forfeited
half
to
me
and
half
to
the
men
of
the
quarter
who
have
a
right
by
law
to
take
his
forfeited
goods
i
give
notice
of
this
suit
in
the
quarter
court
into
which
it
ought
by
law
to
come
i
give
notice
in
the
hearing
of
all
men
on
the
hill
of
laws
i
give
notice
of
this
suit
to
be
pleaded
now
and
of
full
outlawry
against
rolf
hiarandi
son
all
that
was
said
in
the
manner
laid
down
by
law
then
einar
pushed
the
case
and
no
one
was
there
to
answer
him
all
steps
were
taken
then
and
there
and
judgment
was
called
for
and
given
and
in
his
absence
rolf
was
made
full
outlaw
and
his
goods
were
declared
forfeited
not
till
the
court
had
risen
and
nothing
might
be
done
was
the
news
brought
to
snorri
and
rolf
snorri
was
angry
that
he
had
been
tricked
yet
he
could
see
no
way
to
help
himself
this
one
thing
he
brought
about
that
the
judges
declared
that
rolf
outlaw
though
he
was
might
shoot
to
prove
his
innocence
if
he
might
but
get
himself
safely
to
the
spot
and
snorri
sought
to
comfort
rolf
but
the
lad
was
dazed
the
farm
is
lost
he
cried
thou
canst
win
it
back
answered
snorri
thou
art
young
and
thy
strength
will
grow
before
the
seven
years
are
past
thou
canst
make
that
shot
nay
said
rolf
i
can
never
do
it
until
i
find
some
bow
as
strong
as
grettir
yet
which
a
common
man
may
string
never
have
i
found
a
bow
too
stiff
for
me
save
his
alone
skill
may
beat
strength
quoth
snorri
somewhere
mayest
thou
find
the
bow
thou
dreamest
of
where
demanded
rolf
snorri
was
silent
for
he
feared
no
such
bow
was
to
be
found
rolf
sighed
and
my
mother
he
asked
next
she
shall
live
with
me
at
tongue
and
now
said
snorri
meseems
best
that
thou
goest
home
at
once
thou
knowest
all
that
is
to
be
done
i
know
replied
rolf
and
snorri
believed
him
because
to
the
priest
all
the
ways
of
the
law
were
so
familiar
that
it
seemed
all
men
must
know
them
yet
rolf
did
not
know
and
they
meant
different
things
shall
i
lend
thee
money
asked
snorri
or
hast
thou
enough
i
have
plenty
said
rolf
yet
he
had
only
enough
for
the
journey
whereas
much
more
was
needed
then
rolf
took
his
leave
of
snorri
and
gave
him
his
thanks
and
taking
his
horse
he
went
from
the
thingfield
by
the
path
up
the
great
rift
and
he
passed
two
men
of
einar
who
spoke
together
that
they
were
to
start
very
early
in
the
morning
from
the
top
of
the
rift
rolf
looked
down
on
that
plain
where
all
men
were
still
busy
and
which
in
years
had
brought
misfortune
on
all
his
family
then
at
last
he
went
his
way
now
those
men
of
einar
went
to
their
booth
and
told
that
they
had
seen
rolf
departing
hasten
back
at
once
said
ondott
and
find
what
direction
he
takes
and
they
went
and
watched
he
went
northwest
said
they
and
he
took
not
the
straight
track
toward
home
then
he
is
gone
elsewhere
quoth
ondott
and
seemed
glad
hurry
all
of
you
for
he
delivers
himself
into
our
hands
meanwhile
rolf
went
northwest
to
the
valley
of
the
geysirs
and
on
the
second
day
found
grettir
the
strong
cooking
his
food
at
a
boiling
spring
chapter
xvi
the
act
of
distress
rolf
told
grettir
all
that
had
happened
and
much
was
the
outlaw
disappointed
thereat
for
he
had
counted
upon
going
again
among
men
and
had
hoped
to
win
glory
from
the
shooting
so
he
was
sorry
on
his
own
account
but
also
he
consoled
the
boy
for
he
spoke
of
the
great
world
over
the
sea
how
there
were
places
and
peoples
to
be
seen
and
fame
to
be
won
this
is
clearly
seen
by
those
who
read
the
story
of
grettir
that
all
his
life
he
sought
fame
and
his
fate
was
lighter
to
him
because
he
knew
men
would
sing
of
him
after
his
death
but
no
such
thoughts
uplifted
rolf
since
he
grieved
for
his
mother
and
for
the
loss
of
the
farm
and
it
seemed
no
pleasure
to
go
abroad
now
said
he
far
rather
would
i
stay
here
in
this
island
until
the
time
of
outlawry
is
past
why
may
i
not
stay
with
thee
knowest
thou
not
asked
grettir
that
if
one
fares
abroad
the
outlawry
is
for
three
years
but
if
one
stays
it
is
twenty
and
that
is
a
third
of
most
men
lifetime
yet
said
rolf
i
am
minded
to
do
it
for
he
cared
not
what
happened
to
him
now
said
grettir
listen
to
me
and
learn
what
it
means
to
be
an
outlaw
no
man
will
take
thee
within
his
house
so
soon
as
he
knows
who
thou
art
so
must
thou
live
in
the
open
like
a
beast
or
else
make
for
thyself
and
a
miserable
life
it
becomes
after
a
while
no
man
mayest
thou
trust
lest
he
take
thy
head
well
do
i
know
that
gisli
thy
ancestor
lived
an
outlaw
fourteen
years
yet
he
lived
in
holes
and
caves
and
was
slain
at
the
end
he
was
the
greatest
outlaw
of
iceland
before
me
save
only
gunnar
of
lithend
who
tried
to
stay
in
his
home
and
was
slain
but
i
have
maintained
myself
sixteen
years
and
miserable
have
they
been
too
tender
art
thou
of
years
and
frame
to
bear
the
life
moreover
i
know
my
mother
mourns
me
at
home
think
then
of
thine
and
put
this
idea
from
thee
then
rolf
was
ashamed
that
he
had
ever
thought
of
such
a
thing
so
he
spent
a
night
with
grettir
there
among
the
geysirs
and
wonderful
were
the
things
that
he
saw
and
in
the
morning
they
cooked
again
at
the
boiling
spring
then
as
they
sat
eating
grettir
said
by
chance
thou
saidst
thou
art
poor
did
snorri
give
the
money
for
the
dues
and
the
court
what
are
those
dues
asked
rolf
grettir
cried
has
no
money
been
paid
for
thine
outlawry
none
by
me
answered
rolf
and
thy
neighbor
einar
asked
grettir
what
was
he
doing
when
thou
earnest
away
they
were
preparing
for
departure
so
that
i
heard
a
groom
say
they
would
start
before
sunrise
in
the
morning
then
grettir
sprang
up
and
went
and
caught
rolf
pony
he
saddled
it
and
brought
it
to
the
lad
go
home
he
cried
too
little
dost
thou
know
of
the
law
for
if
those
dues
were
paid
then
thou
hadst
a
year
in
which
to
take
ship
but
they
are
not
paid
so
thy
enemy
can
make
thee
full
outlaw
ten
days
after
the
rising
of
the
althing
by
executing
the
act
of
distress
at
thy
house
three
days
are
gone
already
and
thou
art
far
from
home
for
this
was
einar
hastening
away
now
take
my
advice
and
go
south
and
ship
thence
nay
answered
rolf
first
i
must
see
my
mother
and
perhaps
i
can
reach
home
in
time
now
fare
thee
well
grettir
when
thy
outlawry
is
finished
then
thou
shalt
gain
me
my
property
again
but
grettir
said
nay
to
that
well
do
i
know
said
he
that
we
two
shall
never
meet
again
for
from
here
i
go
to
the
island
of
drangey
to
keep
myself
if
i
may
until
my
outlawry
is
over
no
stronger
place
is
there
in
iceland
for
defence
but
hallmund
the
my
friend
foretold
i
should
never
come
out
of
my
outlawry
thus
i
shall
never
again
mix
in
this
affair
of
thine
rolf
could
answer
nothing
and
in
my
turn
said
grettir
thus
i
foretell
thy
fate
no
man
shall
help
thee
here
with
thine
own
strength
and
craft
must
thou
regain
thine
own
or
never
more
be
master
of
thy
fathers
hall
then
rolf
was
as
he
bade
grettir
farewell
and
grettir
did
as
he
had
said
he
went
to
his
home
at
biarg
and
went
thence
with
his
brother
illugi
to
drangey
how
he
fared
there
may
be
read
in
the
grettir
saga
but
rolf
fared
west
to
his
home
he
had
lost
much
time
as
grettir
had
feared
yet
as
he
neared
cragness
on
the
eleventh
day
after
the
rising
of
the
althing
he
saw
no
one
and
it
was
just
noon
and
only
at
high
noon
might
the
act
be
executed
which
would
make
him
full
outlaw
so
he
rode
into
the
yard
then
there
stepped
out
to
meet
him
from
the
house
ondott
crafty
who
came
forward
with
a
greeting
he
spoke
well
to
the
boy
and
bade
him
alight
yet
seemed
to
wish
to
get
very
near
rolf
dismounted
on
the
further
side
of
his
horse
what
doest
thou
here
he
asked
einar
hath
sent
me
said
ondott
still
coming
closer
he
biddeth
thee
come
to
his
house
where
somewhat
can
be
said
concerning
this
outlawry
of
thine
to
make
it
easier
for
thee
but
then
asdis
came
running
from
the
house
flee
she
cried
einar
and
his
men
are
at
the
crags
and
there
they
make
thee
outlaw
flee
then
ondott
snatched
at
rolf
with
his
lean
arms
but
the
lad
felled
him
with
a
buffet
rolf
would
have
mounted
his
horse
again
to
get
away
but
men
appeared
at
the
gate
of
the
yard
so
that
there
was
no
way
out
then
rolf
passed
quickly
into
the
hall
and
kissed
his
mother
farewell
and
leaped
from
a
window
at
the
other
side
meaning
to
gain
the
cliffs
his
way
was
all
but
clear
for
spies
had
seen
coming
and
reported
it
to
einar
who
sent
his
men
to
seize
the
lad
they
had
gone
to
right
and
left
around
the
hall
while
einar
alone
completed
the
act
of
distress
at
the
crags
for
thus
the
law
said
it
must
be
done
at
a
barren
spot
where
no
shade
fell
not
far
from
the
house
of
the
outlaw
and
einar
completed
the
act
and
started
toward
the
house
he
alone
stood
between
rolf
and
his
escape
so
rolf
ran
at
him
drawing
his
sword
but
einar
fled
when
he
saw
the
lad
steel
then
rolf
ran
up
behind
put
his
sword
between
einar
legs
and
tripped
him
einar
rolled
over
on
his
back
mercy
cried
he
and
made
no
attempt
to
ward
himself
rolf
laid
the
flat
of
his
sword
against
einar
forehead
he
shrank
from
the
cold
steel
but
still
did
not
struggle
now
quoth
rolf
i
go
across
the
sea
yet
thou
shalt
hear
from
me
again
and
if
i
meet
in
the
outlands
thy
son
of
whom
thou
boastest
i
promise
thee
to
put
this
sword
to
his
forehead
but
with
the
edge
and
to
draw
his
blood
by
that
the
men
of
einar
were
close
at
hand
rolf
ran
to
the
crags
and
let
himself
down
at
a
place
which
he
knew
well
when
men
with
spears
came
to
the
edge
and
looked
after
him
nothing
of
him
was
seen
chapter
xvii
rolf
and
frodi
fare
abroad
rolf
comes
to
frodi
where
he
works
in
his
smithy
there
at
the
head
of
hvammfirth
now
the
weather
is
rough
and
a
strong
sea
rages
among
the
islands
at
the
mouth
of
the
firth
and
the
are
bad
rolf
comes
into
the
smithy
and
frodi
greets
him
well
how
went
thy
suit
at
the
althing
asks
he
then
rolf
tells
him
all
how
he
was
now
an
outlaw
and
how
he
escaped
and
men
are
out
to
catch
me
for
as
i
came
down
over
the
hill
i
met
one
who
said
that
armed
men
were
at
the
ferry
below
waiting
for
someone
now
lend
me
thy
boat
frodi
that
i
may
cross
to
hvamm
and
seek
passage
on
that
ship
which
is
there
outfitting
remain
with
me
overnight
answered
frodi
for
the
wind
is
rough
but
rolf
would
not
stay
then
said
frodi
i
will
row
with
thee
to
help
against
the
wind
and
coming
back
i
can
row
easily
alone
thou
wouldst
thus
come
into
danger
for
forwarding
an
outlaw
replied
rolf
and
on
no
account
would
he
suffer
frodi
to
go
so
perforce
frodi
lent
him
the
boat
and
they
bade
each
other
and
rolf
set
out
that
was
a
hard
row
in
the
face
of
the
wind
yet
rolf
got
safely
to
hvamm
then
desiring
that
his
enemies
should
think
him
dead
he
set
the
boat
adrift
and
the
oars
separately
and
saw
the
waves
carry
them
from
the
shore
then
he
went
on
his
way
to
the
ship
which
was
fitting
for
the
outward
voyage
and
because
it
was
the
law
that
no
shipmaster
might
refuse
passage
to
an
outlaw
rolf
was
sure
of
safety
as
he
went
he
met
a
man
of
snorri
the
priest
and
rolf
sent
by
him
a
message
to
his
master
forget
not
thy
promise
to
keep
my
mother
till
my
return
and
so
he
came
to
the
ship
and
was
sheltered
but
that
boat
drifted
across
the
firth
and
the
wind
and
tide
brought
it
again
to
frodi
smithy
where
it
lay
and
beat
upon
the
beach
frodi
went
out
and
drew
it
up
and
knew
it
as
his
own
and
believed
that
rolf
was
drowned
he
went
back
to
his
smithy
and
sat
there
weeping
then
came
that
way
men
of
einar
hallvard
and
hallmund
with
ondott
crafty
and
seeing
they
were
three
and
frodi
so
mild
of
temper
they
went
into
the
smithy
to
taunt
him
with
the
misfortunes
of
rolf
because
he
wept
they
fell
to
laughing
and
asked
him
why
weepest
thou
frodi
told
them
that
rolf
was
dead
for
he
took
my
boat
to
row
across
the
firth
and
now
is
the
boat
come
empty
to
land
without
oars
or
then
they
laughed
the
more
and
taunted
him
grievously
saying
they
were
glad
at
the
news
and
mocking
his
weeping
so
hallmund
came
near
and
put
his
hand
on
frodi
calling
him
a
fool
frodi
seized
the
hand
and
rose
and
they
all
saw
his
face
was
changed
never
in
my
life
said
frodi
have
i
been
angry
till
now
he
drew
the
man
to
him
and
snapped
the
bones
of
his
arm
then
he
raised
him
and
cast
him
at
hallvard
so
that
the
two
fell
but
ondott
remained
standing
now
ondott
quoth
frodi
here
is
the
whittle
which
once
thou
badst
me
draw
let
us
see
if
it
will
cut
but
when
he
drew
the
whittle
ondott
fled
and
the
others
scrambled
together
out
of
the
smithy
then
frodi
was
afraid
of
the
law
for
he
thought
they
will
make
me
an
outlaw
for
this
assault
so
he
took
his
boat
and
got
new
oars
and
then
he
fetched
his
money
from
his
sleeping
loft
and
fared
across
hvammfirth
to
that
same
ship
where
rolf
was
great
was
his
joy
when
he
saw
rolf
what
dost
thou
here
asked
rolf
i
will
go
with
thee
answered
frodi
then
he
paid
the
shipmaster
his
faring
and
paid
rolf
also
two
days
thereafter
they
sailed
down
broadfirth
and
saw
cragness
at
a
little
distance
the
cairn
of
hiarandi
was
to
be
seen
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
but
many
persons
were
at
work
in
the
field
rolf
knew
that
his
enemies
had
already
set
up
their
household
there
but
the
ship
took
him
east
over
the
sea
chapter
xviii
how
those
two
came
into
thraldom
two
earls
ruled
in
the
orkneys
brusi
and
thorfinn
of
the
islands
two
thirds
were
under
brusi
the
elder
but
besides
his
third
thorfinn
had
inherited
caithness
and
sunderland
in
scotland
from
his
grandfather
the
scot
king
so
thorfinn
lived
on
those
lands
and
brusi
guarded
all
the
isles
but
thorfinn
complained
that
the
guard
was
since
vikings
harried
oft
in
the
isles
coming
from
norway
or
denmark
there
was
a
man
named
ar
the
peacock
who
was
a
thane
of
brusi
the
earl
and
lived
on
the
mainland
of
orkney
now
the
mainland
of
orkney
is
an
island
and
ar
ruled
its
northern
end
having
charge
of
the
tribute
to
the
earl
and
the
keeping
of
order
he
lived
at
that
place
called
hawksness
in
hawkdale
below
the
downs
and
sheepwalks
where
is
good
harbor
in
winter
forty
men
he
kept
and
a
his
hall
was
great
and
there
was
a
stone
church
close
by
and
farmers
lived
in
the
same
settlement
ar
was
a
vain
man
and
fond
of
show
kindly
but
weak
because
he
had
no
child
he
had
taken
to
him
a
lad
to
foster
who
was
called
grani
the
proud
ar
fosterling
grani
was
tall
and
fair
of
sixteen
summers
skilled
in
games
but
ignorant
of
war
he
was
dear
to
his
heart
and
ar
could
deny
him
nothing
that
of
ar
was
for
the
ward
of
the
isles
and
ar
kept
it
at
all
times
in
readiness
one
day
news
came
that
vikings
were
on
the
west
coast
plundering
and
burning
ar
sent
for
sweyn
the
master
of
his
ship
thou
shalt
take
the
best
of
thy
men
said
ar
and
search
for
those
vikings
and
because
earl
thorfinn
has
complained
that
our
work
is
thou
shalt
take
all
pains
sweyn
said
he
would
then
grani
stood
before
ar
and
said
thou
hast
many
times
promised
i
should
go
now
may
i
go
with
sweyn
or
wilt
thou
put
me
off
yet
another
time
ar
remembered
that
he
had
heard
of
but
one
so
he
said
thou
mayest
go
thou
hast
promised
me
thralls
when
the
next
captives
are
taken
may
i
choose
them
from
this
ship
two
thralls
mayest
thou
have
answered
ar
but
all
orkneymen
are
to
be
freed
when
they
made
ready
to
go
ar
said
to
sweyn
that
grani
should
be
guarded
in
the
fight
and
sweyn
promised
to
look
well
to
that
they
went
on
board
and
sailed
round
into
the
open
sea
there
they
passed
first
the
great
cliffs
and
then
cruised
along
the
shore
looking
for
the
ship
of
the
vikings
now
the
ship
of
those
chapmen
who
had
given
passage
to
rolf
and
frodi
had
a
good
voyage
those
two
broadfirthers
were
the
only
icelanders
aboard
to
them
the
orkneyingers
boasted
much
of
their
land
in
spite
of
what
ye
say
quoth
rolf
to
them
the
orkneys
are
no
such
safe
place
as
iceland
as
i
see
clearly
now
that
we
are
nearing
land
in
what
dost
thou
see
it
asked
the
others
with
us
are
no
answered
rolf
but
ye
have
set
a
watch
against
vikings
and
fear
them
this
the
orkneyingers
could
not
deny
for
they
had
kept
a
ever
since
they
had
neared
the
land
yet
all
their
care
did
not
avail
them
for
they
met
a
ship
in
the
pentland
firth
a
and
hardy
shields
hung
along
its
sides
and
it
sailed
swiftly
when
the
chapmen
saw
the
shields
taken
from
the
rail
they
knew
that
was
a
so
the
chapmen
prepared
to
defend
themselves
rolf
got
ready
to
fight
but
when
the
vikings
drew
near
frodi
sat
himself
down
on
a
rowing
bench
and
looked
troubled
wilt
thou
not
fight
asked
the
shipmaster
frodi
answered
it
is
not
clear
to
me
what
i
should
do
shame
on
thee
cried
the
other
if
thou
wilt
not
fight
for
the
men
who
harbored
thee
illustration
so
tall
was
she
that
the
vikings
could
not
board
her
so
frodi
all
without
arms
stood
up
as
the
two
ships
came
together
and
knew
not
where
to
place
himself
the
vikings
came
leaping
aboard
and
all
began
fighting
in
confusion
but
the
vikings
were
many
and
were
well
armed
and
the
chapmen
had
no
leader
men
fell
dead
at
frodi
side
and
a
viking
came
at
him
with
brandished
sword
frodi
caught
him
and
hurled
him
into
the
water
then
he
took
those
other
vikings
who
came
near
him
and
cast
them
overboard
one
after
another
and
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
thought
he
if
they
can
not
swim
and
he
cleared
a
space
about
him
but
one
from
a
distance
cast
at
him
a
it
struck
him
flatwise
on
the
head
and
down
he
fell
by
this
time
the
chapmen
were
ceasing
to
fight
but
rolf
saw
frodi
fall
and
fought
the
harder
to
avenge
him
the
vikings
penned
him
by
the
rail
yet
he
broke
through
them
then
when
he
passed
near
where
frodi
had
fallen
frodi
rose
up
and
caught
rolf
by
the
waist
and
said
now
sit
we
down
comfortably
here
together
for
we
have
done
our
part
that
was
the
end
of
the
fight
for
no
men
fought
more
and
the
vikings
gave
peace
to
them
now
men
began
to
shout
from
the
water
where
they
were
swimming
three
were
hauled
up
over
the
side
how
many
asked
rolf
of
frodi
threwest
thou
over
frodi
turned
white
and
would
not
answer
then
the
vikings
despoiled
the
ship
of
the
chapmen
and
set
her
adrift
but
the
captives
were
set
to
row
the
rolf
and
frodi
toiled
at
one
oar
together
and
sore
was
the
labor
but
not
for
long
for
on
the
third
day
as
they
rowed
under
a
bright
sky
with
no
wind
they
heard
a
clamor
among
the
vikings
who
cried
that
a
long
ship
was
bearing
down
on
them
an
orkney
ship
great
in
size
some
of
the
vikings
snatched
their
shields
from
the
bulwarks
and
armed
themselves
but
many
crying
that
no
mercy
would
be
shown
would
take
no
shields
and
instead
cast
off
their
shirts
of
mail
preparing
to
go
into
battle
baresark
never
have
i
seen
that
said
rolf
though
much
have
i
heard
of
it
for
northmen
in
danger
of
death
often
went
into
battle
bare
of
armor
fighting
with
fury
and
mindless
of
wounds
they
believed
that
thus
they
came
surely
into
valhalla
but
that
was
a
custom
of
the
heathen
and
was
not
done
by
christian
folk
rolf
and
frodi
were
tied
to
their
bench
and
saw
nothing
of
the
orkneymen
as
they
came
up
astern
but
at
last
the
splash
of
oars
was
heard
next
a
grapple
came
flying
aboard
then
of
a
sudden
the
orkney
ship
loomed
alongside
and
she
was
a
big
ship
indeed
so
tall
was
she
that
the
vikings
could
not
board
her
but
from
her
the
orkneymen
sent
down
arrows
stones
and
spears
bodies
of
men
fell
among
the
benches
and
rolf
and
frodi
took
each
a
shield
sat
close
together
and
warded
themselves
against
weapons
then
the
orkneyingers
having
cleared
the
waist
of
the
of
fighters
came
tumbling
aboard
that
was
a
fight
with
method
for
the
orkneymen
in
two
parties
drove
the
vikings
to
the
stem
and
the
stern
and
so
either
slew
them
or
thrust
them
into
the
sea
very
hot
was
the
fighting
but
it
was
short
the
sixth
part
of
an
hour
was
not
over
when
the
fighting
was
finished
now
that
orkney
ship
was
the
ship
of
ar
the
peacock
and
they
who
led
the
fighting
were
sweyn
and
grani
sweyn
drove
the
vikings
to
the
bow
but
grani
led
those
who
fought
in
the
stern
and
two
old
warded
him
one
on
either
side
grani
did
not
know
that
they
were
guarding
him
when
the
fighting
was
finished
sweyn
and
grani
met
in
the
waist
near
where
rolf
sat
sweyn
asked
grani
if
he
had
any
wound
grani
said
nay
thereto
but
i
gave
wounds
and
this
has
been
a
great
fight
now
said
sweyn
let
us
free
those
who
worked
at
the
oars
remember
answered
grani
that
i
am
to
have
thralls
from
the
captives
but
of
those
who
had
been
taken
with
the
ship
it
was
found
that
all
the
vikings
were
either
dead
or
sore
wounded
and
all
the
rowers
were
orkneymen
save
only
rolf
and
frodi
no
orkneymen
can
i
give
thee
as
thrall
said
sweyn
grani
answered
then
i
take
the
two
others
then
rolf
stood
up
and
said
icelanders
are
we
since
when
are
icelanders
enthralled
in
the
orkneys
and
why
is
this
injustice
ye
are
captives
said
grani
sweyn
took
him
aside
to
speak
with
him
but
he
would
not
listen
and
said
pouting
ar
promised
me
take
them
then
replied
sweyn
grani
said
to
rolf
and
frodi
ye
are
my
thralls
i
will
treat
you
well
what
are
your
names
rolf
answered
rolf
hight
i
of
what
father
and
what
place
a
thrall
answered
rolf
hath
no
father
and
no
home
frodi
replied
in
like
manner
it
is
plain
to
see
said
sweyn
that
these
two
should
be
free
men
let
them
win
their
freedom
then
answered
grani
then
a
division
of
men
was
made
and
sweyn
took
the
chapmen
with
him
in
the
large
ship
but
grani
stayed
on
board
the
as
its
master
they
sailed
together
for
the
orkney
coast
when
night
came
grani
called
rolf
and
frodi
and
bade
them
watch
by
turns
while
he
slept
i
will
be
a
good
master
so
long
as
ye
serve
me
well
rolf
thought
grani
to
be
about
his
age
yet
not
so
old
in
mind
much
pleased
was
grani
to
own
thralls
he
seemed
kindly
but
petulant
and
uncertain
chapter
xix
now
men
are
shipwrecked
those
two
ships
sailed
together
all
that
day
but
in
the
night
they
became
separated
for
there
was
a
little
wind
in
the
morning
ship
was
close
to
a
shore
and
that
was
the
mainland
of
orkney
for
miles
great
cliffs
stood
up
out
of
the
water
the
wind
fell
and
there
was
a
long
then
said
grani
often
have
i
seen
these
cliffs
from
above
now
it
will
be
sport
to
see
them
from
below
put
in
close
and
sail
along
under
the
cliffs
those
two
old
men
who
had
warded
him
in
the
fight
both
spoke
to
him
saying
it
were
better
to
keep
away
but
grani
pouted
and
gave
his
order
again
all
men
say
quoth
he
that
the
water
is
deep
there
and
no
harm
can
befall
then
they
sailed
along
under
the
cliffs
and
a
grand
sight
that
was
to
see
them
high
above
and
stretching
far
ahead
rolf
stood
in
the
bow
and
he
looked
first
up
at
the
cliffs
and
then
down
into
the
green
water
there
came
a
great
wave
larger
than
the
others
and
after
it
the
water
fell
away
just
before
the
ship
rolf
saw
a
rock
break
the
water
with
scarcely
a
ripple
for
it
was
very
sharp
floated
around
its
sides
another
wave
came
and
lifted
the
ship
up
and
the
rock
disappeared
as
if
it
had
sunk
down
rolf
shouted
in
warning
but
the
wave
passed
the
ship
rushed
down
into
the
hollow
and
struck
the
rock
the
planks
tore
apart
beneath
the
bow
and
all
heard
the
splintering
then
the
water
poured
in
a
wave
lifted
the
ship
and
she
slid
back
into
deep
water
she
began
to
sink
there
was
scarcely
time
to
throw
over
oars
and
shields
and
to
leap
after
them
into
the
water
the
ship
went
down
the
men
were
swimming
there
under
the
wall
of
rock
they
swam
toward
the
cliff
and
those
who
swam
worst
clung
to
the
oars
but
the
cliff
rose
sharp
from
the
water
only
was
to
be
had
and
the
waves
bruised
the
men
as
they
tried
to
support
themselves
eighteen
men
in
all
were
there
and
they
swam
in
a
line
along
the
cliff
for
an
hour
until
at
last
they
found
a
foothold
where
a
shelf
of
rock
jutted
under
water
and
all
might
stand
waist
deep
then
one
of
the
men
asked
is
the
tide
coming
or
going
they
watched
to
find
out
and
at
last
it
was
sure
the
tide
was
coming
it
rose
above
their
waists
so
that
the
smaller
men
were
lifted
by
the
waves
and
it
was
lucky
that
there
was
no
storm
for
they
would
all
have
been
killed
then
the
tide
rose
still
higher
and
men
began
to
look
anxious
there
they
stayed
half
an
hour
more
and
the
swam
about
and
looked
at
them
frodi
said
to
rolf
what
dost
thou
think
and
why
thou
so
at
the
cliffs
above
us
they
seem
to
me
like
the
cliffs
at
home
were
we
there
i
could
climb
up
seest
thou
no
way
here
asked
frodi
i
see
two
ways
answered
rolf
yet
neither
seems
good
grani
asked
what
are
my
thralls
saying
the
water
said
rolf
will
take
thy
thralls
from
thee
but
one
of
the
men
had
heard
what
had
been
said
and
told
grani
grani
cried
why
dost
thou
not
try
the
climb
send
one
of
those
answered
rolf
who
cares
to
save
his
life
this
he
said
of
a
set
purpose
for
of
the
men
some
were
heavy
and
some
were
old
they
all
shook
their
heads
and
said
they
could
not
win
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
grani
said
i
will
give
thee
thy
freedom
if
thou
wilt
save
us
is
there
a
farm
above
asked
rolf
one
of
the
men
said
within
a
mile
rolf
still
stayed
where
he
was
why
dost
thou
not
go
cried
grani
what
of
the
freedom
of
my
fellow
asked
rolf
he
also
shall
be
free
answered
grani
then
rolf
essayed
to
climb
the
cliff
by
the
way
which
seemed
surest
he
went
up
quickly
until
they
lost
sight
of
him
so
that
they
began
to
say
that
now
he
was
at
the
top
and
would
soon
bring
a
rope
then
something
fell
with
a
great
splash
in
the
water
he
hath
reached
the
top
and
thrown
down
a
rock
cried
the
men
but
that
was
rolf
himself
for
he
had
fallen
from
near
the
top
presently
they
saw
his
head
all
breathless
and
bruised
he
swam
to
them
and
waited
a
while
then
he
sought
to
climb
by
the
other
way
and
that
was
more
in
sight
of
the
others
marvellous
climbing
they
agreed
it
was
after
a
while
he
went
again
out
of
their
sight
and
in
the
end
they
heard
him
hail
so
they
were
sure
he
was
at
the
top
then
they
waited
for
him
to
bring
the
rope
and
the
water
rose
to
the
breastbone
of
frodi
who
was
tallest
but
it
was
at
the
chin
of
the
shortest
who
had
to
float
while
frodi
held
him
they
stayed
there
a
long
time
and
the
water
rose
still
higher
it
was
cold
and
some
of
the
men
grew
very
faint
at
last
shouts
were
heard
and
a
rope
came
dangling
down
then
the
shortest
man
climbed
the
rope
and
he
was
glad
but
others
were
too
weak
to
climb
and
had
to
be
drawn
up
one
after
another
grani
would
not
go
but
sent
up
the
men
in
the
order
of
their
height
when
he
and
frodi
alone
were
left
grani
said
to
frodi
go
thou
next
great
is
thy
pride
answered
frodi
and
thou
wishest
to
do
a
brave
deed
yet
thy
strength
is
not
sufficient
for
see
thou
art
blue
about
the
lips
and
i
am
holding
thee
upright
how
shouldst
thou
stay
alone
after
i
have
gone
up
but
i
could
stand
here
yet
another
hour
thou
must
go
next
i
will
stay
to
the
last
answered
grani
then
the
rope
came
down
again
i
will
not
go
said
grani
then
i
shall
tie
thee
by
force
and
send
thee
up
said
frodi
but
then
was
heard
a
great
shouting
and
there
came
a
ship
which
had
seen
the
work
of
rescue
and
had
put
in
shore
grani
said
i
will
go
in
the
ship
they
are
sending
a
boat
when
the
boat
came
from
the
ship
grani
went
in
it
but
frodi
climbed
the
rope
and
told
rolf
what
had
been
said
that
was
a
ship
of
chapmen
and
its
master
asked
grani
who
he
was
and
gave
him
food
and
drink
and
carried
him
round
the
end
of
the
mainland
to
hawksness
but
those
others
who
had
reached
the
top
of
the
cliff
had
no
other
way
than
to
walk
four
leagues
they
fared
on
foot
reaching
hawksness
after
nightfall
meanwhile
grani
spoke
much
with
the
shipmaster
and
they
grew
very
friendly
they
came
to
hawksness
about
the
same
time
as
the
other
men
came
from
the
moors
and
they
all
walked
up
to
the
hall
together
rolf
walks
with
frodi
but
the
shipmaster
goes
with
grani
and
passes
near
them
the
shipmaster
sees
them
but
they
do
not
mark
him
then
the
shipmaster
pulls
at
grani
sleeve
and
draws
him
aside
the
shipmaster
asks
those
two
who
walk
there
are
thy
thralls
grani
said
so
then
the
shipmaster
said
didst
thou
say
thou
wouldst
set
them
free
aye
answered
grani
it
hath
come
to
my
mind
said
the
other
that
they
did
not
save
thee
but
i
did
moreover
there
was
no
need
for
climbing
the
cliff
for
i
should
have
been
able
to
save
ye
all
that
is
true
said
grani
now
quoth
the
shipmaster
thou
art
very
reckless
of
thy
possessions
if
thou
settest
those
thralls
free
truly
answered
grani
i
will
not
free
them
when
they
reached
the
hall
sweyn
had
arrived
before
them
and
the
booty
of
the
vikings
lay
in
the
hall
but
ar
was
waiting
anxiously
for
his
and
welcomed
him
gladly
then
a
true
tale
was
required
of
all
that
had
happened
grani
told
each
thing
as
it
had
come
about
when
he
told
of
his
thralls
ar
said
since
those
two
are
icelanders
who
are
close
to
us
by
ties
of
blood
it
were
better
to
have
set
them
free
thou
didst
not
reserve
any
save
orkneymen
answered
grani
then
he
told
of
the
wreck
and
the
rescue
said
ar
so
those
two
have
their
freedom
in
the
end
grani
called
rolf
and
frodi
to
the
dais
thou
didst
not
save
my
life
said
he
that
is
true
answered
rolf
moreover
quoth
grani
the
ship
would
have
saved
us
all
that
also
is
true
said
rolf
therefore
i
see
no
reason
said
grani
next
why
i
should
set
thee
free
rolf
and
frodi
answered
nothing
see
said
grani
to
ar
they
make
no
objection
therefore
i
shall
keep
them
as
thralls
but
i
will
give
each
of
them
what
he
cares
to
choose
of
the
spoil
if
thou
permit
then
permission
was
given
and
the
spoil
of
the
vikings
was
spread
out
there
before
the
dais
there
were
fine
things
of
many
kinds
but
rolf
put
the
gold
and
silver
by
and
took
only
a
cloak
then
said
grani
choose
again
rolf
took
a
belt
choose
again
repeated
grani
rolf
took
a
short
sword
choose
yet
again
cried
grani
but
rolf
would
take
nothing
more
and
frodi
took
naught
but
a
cloak
and
a
whittle
a
strange
pair
are
ye
quoth
grani
but
ar
called
them
to
him
and
asked
them
why
they
had
chosen
so
little
we
take
only
our
own
answered
rolf
cloaks
and
weapons
said
ar
are
they
dear
to
ye
his
mother
said
frodi
made
me
my
cloak
but
the
whittle
belonged
to
my
father
and
thy
things
asked
ar
of
rolf
who
gave
them
to
thee
snorri
the
priest
answered
rolf
gave
me
the
cloak
and
burning
flosi
gave
the
belt
but
if
ye
do
not
know
these
names
i
know
them
both
said
sweyn
the
but
who
gave
the
sword
kari
solmund
son
answered
rolf
and
that
name
thou
shouldst
know
best
of
all
sweyn
cried
i
know
the
man
himself
for
he
is
an
orkneyman
by
birth
here
under
earl
sigurd
and
of
great
fame
now
tell
us
the
story
why
he
gave
thee
the
sword
but
rolf
would
tell
nothing
then
sweyn
offered
to
buy
rolf
of
grani
but
he
puffed
out
his
lips
and
would
not
sell
his
thrall
so
nothing
came
of
that
rescue
by
rolf
save
to
give
him
a
name
among
the
orkneyingers
now
all
men
sit
down
for
the
evening
meal
that
shipmaster
wishes
to
leave
the
hall
saying
he
must
look
to
his
ship
but
grani
will
not
let
him
go
then
frodi
sees
him
and
pushes
rolf
in
the
side
says
frodi
men
said
your
uncle
was
dead
so
they
did
answers
rolf
but
he
does
not
attend
and
falls
to
brooding
so
frodi
says
that
again
rolf
asks
him
why
who
sits
by
the
dais
asked
frodi
rolf
looked
on
that
shipmaster
and
it
was
his
father
brother
kiartan
chapter
xx
how
rolf
won
his
freedom
now
when
that
meal
was
ended
kiartan
rose
up
and
said
that
he
must
go
he
thanked
ar
and
grani
walked
with
him
to
the
door
but
as
they
passed
by
the
bench
whereon
rolf
and
frodi
were
sitting
grani
beckoned
them
to
rise
up
and
he
said
to
kiartan
look
on
my
thralls
now
that
thou
canst
see
them
closer
and
tell
me
what
thou
thinkest
of
them
kiartan
scarcely
looked
at
them
they
seem
a
good
pair
he
answered
it
is
fitting
for
thy
dignity
to
have
thralls
then
he
went
away
frodi
asked
of
rolf
did
he
know
us
he
knew
us
well
answered
rolf
what
wilt
thou
do
asked
frodi
i
see
naught
to
do
said
rolf
for
what
he
did
against
my
father
was
done
in
iceland
so
that
i
could
not
bring
a
suit
at
law
here
moreover
no
thrall
can
bring
a
suit
in
any
land
wilt
thou
claim
kinship
with
him
frodi
asked
wilt
thou
responded
rolf
no
more
words
were
said
but
it
was
seen
in
their
eyes
that
for
their
pride
sake
they
would
make
no
claim
on
kiartan
kiartan
found
that
nothing
was
said
in
the
matter
so
he
stayed
there
in
the
place
and
won
the
friendship
of
ar
by
gifts
and
traded
with
success
he
ate
often
at
the
hall
and
slept
there
whenever
he
would
but
no
word
passed
between
him
and
those
kinsmen
nor
did
they
ever
look
at
him
grani
was
proud
that
he
owned
thralls
and
he
commanded
them
to
show
what
they
could
do
so
rolf
shot
with
the
bow
and
grani
made
him
his
but
frodi
said
he
knew
little
of
weapons
yet
when
they
gave
him
a
spear
he
shot
it
through
two
shields
braced
together
against
posts
he
asked
for
work
as
a
smith
but
grani
made
him
and
the
youth
often
walked
abroad
with
those
other
two
attending
him
ar
was
pleased
with
that
show
but
the
thralls
smiled
grimly
to
each
other
once
kiartan
saw
that
smile
and
he
said
to
grani
privily
thy
thralls
smile
at
thy
back
and
make
as
if
they
feel
shame
now
be
careful
lest
they
harm
thee
sometime
when
thou
art
alone
with
them
if
i
were
thee
i
would
set
them
at
the
or
the
grani
answered
i
fear
no
harm
from
them
and
indeed
i
like
them
more
every
day
i
can
not
spare
them
now
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
this
that
grani
cast
a
great
love
upon
rolf
and
would
have
him
as
a
friend
not
thinking
that
no
friendship
can
be
between
master
and
slave
he
gave
rolf
gifts
everything
but
his
freedom
he
spoke
much
with
rolf
yet
the
talk
was
most
upon
the
one
side
for
rolf
grew
very
silent
yet
rolf
went
everywhere
after
grani
and
did
him
much
service
of
all
kinds
being
clever
with
his
hands
and
wise
in
his
ways
he
knew
a
boat
and
all
the
modes
of
fishing
when
it
came
to
no
man
in
that
place
was
his
match
grani
often
went
seeking
adventure
with
rolf
and
frodi
they
managed
in
such
wise
that
frodi
did
the
work
and
rolf
directed
what
should
be
done
when
they
went
after
birds
frodi
sat
at
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
held
the
rope
but
on
the
cliff
face
rolf
would
let
grani
take
no
risks
nay
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
rolf
were
the
master
and
grani
the
man
but
when
other
people
were
about
rolf
did
all
that
grani
said
one
day
a
bishop
came
to
hawksness
and
visited
the
parish
he
held
service
in
the
church
and
lived
at
the
hall
for
two
days
when
he
was
about
to
go
away
he
asked
if
any
man
needed
from
him
counsel
or
comfort
frodi
stood
up
said
he
lord
bishop
are
all
manslayings
sinful
the
bishop
answered
state
me
the
case
for
some
manslayings
are
blameless
so
frodi
spoke
thus
if
a
man
is
on
a
ship
and
vikings
come
and
that
man
casts
a
viking
overboard
and
the
viking
is
drowned
hath
the
man
committed
a
mortal
sin
many
men
smiled
at
these
words
for
the
story
of
frodi
and
the
vikings
had
been
told
the
bishop
said
vikings
are
the
worst
plague
of
the
land
and
they
deserve
no
mercy
since
the
viking
came
to
take
life
it
was
no
sin
to
slay
him
frodi
drew
a
long
breath
but
he
asked
further
if
two
vikings
were
drowned
what
of
that
it
is
the
same
answered
the
bishop
but
if
three
men
were
thus
drowned
asked
frodi
what
then
even
if
thirty
died
answered
the
bishop
the
answer
is
still
the
same
then
frodi
heaved
a
great
sigh
and
looked
so
relieved
that
all
who
stood
by
shouted
with
merriment
grani
was
pleased
most
of
all
and
he
gave
command
that
frodi
should
be
called
frodi
liked
that
little
yet
by
that
name
he
was
called
for
a
while
and
grani
was
so
pleased
with
all
this
that
he
boasted
much
about
his
thralls
one
day
he
spoke
of
them
with
kiartan
and
told
how
when
they
went
away
together
rolf
took
the
lead
and
he
cares
for
me
said
grani
as
if
i
were
his
brother
but
so
soon
as
others
are
by
he
is
as
any
other
thrall
and
says
no
word
unless
spoken
to
kiartan
said
in
that
he
appears
to
me
sly
how
should
that
be
asked
grani
he
seeks
to
gain
influence
over
thee
answered
kiartan
nay
said
grani
he
and
i
are
friends
kiartan
shook
his
head
quoth
he
in
my
country
we
have
a
saying
is
a
thrall
for
a
friend
moreover
to
lack
dignity
at
any
time
is
not
seeming
in
one
of
thy
station
grani
took
those
sayings
much
to
heart
he
went
no
more
away
alone
with
his
thralls
but
stayed
where
were
other
men
now
that
was
the
time
when
the
summer
had
passed
by
and
harvests
were
all
in
but
winter
had
not
yet
come
and
the
weather
was
mild
men
were
saying
that
when
winter
should
come
it
would
be
with
suddenness
there
came
a
day
when
the
wind
was
high
but
it
was
as
soft
as
summer
a
man
named
thord
the
weatherwise
came
to
ar
and
said
see
to
it
that
all
is
ready
for
the
winter
and
without
more
words
departed
ar
inquired
of
his
men
if
the
sheep
were
yet
gathered
in
from
the
downs
above
the
cliffs
it
was
answered
that
they
were
not
ar
bade
send
a
man
quickly
to
warn
the
shepherds
it
was
told
ar
that
the
fishers
had
just
come
in
and
that
all
the
were
busied
at
the
beach
being
much
needed
to
save
the
catch
of
fish
for
the
waves
were
high
ar
said
to
grani
lend
me
one
of
thy
thralls
to
take
my
message
thou
mayest
have
both
of
them
answered
grani
so
rolf
and
frodi
prepared
to
go
to
the
downs
and
a
long
jaunt
that
would
be
but
when
grani
saw
they
were
ready
he
felt
desire
to
go
with
them
since
he
had
not
done
much
for
some
days
and
needed
action
so
he
said
that
rolf
and
frodi
should
wait
till
he
could
go
with
them
they
went
outside
the
hall
to
wait
and
grani
bound
on
his
shoes
now
kiartan
had
stood
by
and
heard
all
that
and
he
said
so
thou
goest
out
again
with
thy
friends
grani
answered
with
pride
i
go
with
my
thralls
he
went
outside
the
hall
and
found
rolf
and
frodi
waiting
rolf
looked
him
over
and
seeing
there
was
no
one
by
he
said
take
thy
cloak
for
we
may
be
benighted
lo
answered
grani
the
thrall
gives
orders
to
his
master
we
shall
be
back
before
men
go
to
bed
no
cloak
is
needed
and
i
forbid
ye
to
take
yours
so
rolf
and
frodi
left
their
cloaks
behind
and
went
with
grani
to
the
moors
the
moors
were
wide
and
rolling
and
lay
above
those
cliffs
whereby
they
had
once
been
wrecked
the
three
travelled
not
as
had
been
their
wont
all
together
but
grani
went
ahead
saying
to
himself
they
should
remember
that
they
were
thralls
in
going
so
he
missed
his
way
and
they
came
to
the
sheepcotes
roundabout
and
late
there
they
found
the
men
busy
gathering
in
the
sheep
making
ready
to
drive
them
to
the
valleys
when
this
gale
should
pass
some
men
said
that
would
be
on
the
morrow
for
the
wind
was
falling
even
while
they
spoke
the
wind
dropped
completely
and
there
was
a
calm
see
said
grani
the
storm
is
over
it
was
but
a
gale
the
head
shepherd
said
he
thought
not
so
and
that
more
was
to
be
looked
for
moreover
thy
icelanders
think
the
same
as
i
can
see
by
their
faces
i
ask
not
what
they
think
answered
grani
there
is
blue
sky
in
the
south
thy
thralls
and
i
replied
the
shepherd
look
to
the
north
and
now
i
beg
that
thou
wilt
stay
here
overnight
for
company
sake
i
see
thou
hast
fear
for
me
said
grani
but
i
will
return
then
hasten
begged
the
shepherd
but
grani
would
not
hurry
and
started
leisurely
the
shepherd
called
a
man
and
privately
told
him
he
should
guide
those
three
for
he
knew
the
moors
then
the
shepherd
begged
grani
that
the
man
might
go
to
hawksness
with
him
for
his
work
at
the
folds
was
done
the
four
started
together
soon
a
little
wind
thin
and
keen
began
to
blow
from
the
north
it
grew
greater
quickly
until
it
was
half
a
gale
by
that
time
they
were
where
they
could
see
the
sea
and
grani
looked
out
upon
it
quoth
he
fog
is
coming
from
the
water
now
rolf
had
been
silent
so
far
all
that
afternoon
yet
he
could
be
so
no
longer
said
he
not
fog
is
that
but
snow
and
i
beg
thee
to
turn
back
lead
forward
said
grani
to
the
shepherd
so
they
went
on
as
they
had
been
going
another
and
each
minute
the
wind
grew
stronger
they
neared
the
line
of
the
cliffs
and
walked
parallel
with
them
at
a
distance
then
that
which
had
appeared
to
be
fog
on
the
water
at
last
moved
inland
so
that
they
saw
it
coming
like
a
wall
it
left
the
sea
and
swallowed
up
the
land
before
it
then
it
swept
upon
them
silently
and
they
bent
before
its
onslaught
wind
buffeted
them
and
roared
in
their
ears
a
few
snowflakes
drove
along
the
ground
then
they
were
enfolded
in
the
swirl
of
snow
all
around
them
became
one
gray
fleece
they
could
not
see
for
a
rod
in
front
and
they
shivered
with
the
cold
they
struggled
onwards
bending
to
the
wind
and
night
came
down
an
hour
before
its
time
the
snow
began
to
heap
thickly
and
now
it
was
above
the
ankle
now
a
foot
in
depth
wonderful
was
that
fall
of
snow
they
walked
one
behind
the
other
the
shepherd
in
front
then
grani
rolf
and
frodi
each
so
close
as
to
touch
the
next
one
with
his
hand
the
night
grew
black
and
the
wind
was
loud
then
at
last
rolf
shouted
that
they
should
stop
why
sayest
thou
that
asked
grani
because
i
think
we
near
the
cliffs
said
rolf
i
hear
no
surf
answered
grani
but
the
guide
thought
that
rolf
was
right
grani
asked
what
they
should
do
rolf
answered
best
stay
here
till
morning
shall
i
freeze
asked
grani
let
us
turn
away
and
walk
further
inland
we
can
not
keep
our
direction
said
rolf
wilt
thou
never
be
silent
asked
grani
we
will
go
inland
so
they
sought
to
do
so
and
they
walked
for
another
while
then
grani
asked
the
shepherd
if
he
knew
where
he
was
and
the
man
could
not
say
when
they
went
on
again
frodi
pressed
forward
and
took
the
place
behind
the
shepherd
and
when
grani
asked
for
the
place
frodi
would
not
give
it
so
they
walked
thus
for
another
while
their
feet
clogged
by
the
snow
their
faces
stung
with
the
wind
plodding
with
great
effort
and
weariness
then
at
the
end
that
happened
which
rolf
had
feared
for
of
a
sudden
the
roar
of
the
sea
burst
up
at
them
from
their
very
feet
and
the
guide
with
a
cry
sank
in
the
darkness
frodi
clutched
at
him
but
caught
only
the
cloak
the
clasp
broke
and
the
man
fell
to
his
death
those
other
three
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
while
below
the
sea
thundered
yet
they
saw
nothing
then
rolf
took
grani
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
away
frodi
followed
the
noise
of
the
surf
was
suddenly
lost
in
the
wind
and
no
one
would
have
known
they
were
near
the
cliff
rolf
led
the
way
inland
and
frodi
walked
last
they
went
very
cautiously
and
frodi
was
ever
ready
to
seize
on
grani
at
last
they
reached
a
mound
in
its
lee
the
wind
was
less
and
the
snow
was
piling
deep
rolf
scooped
space
for
them
all
and
there
they
sat
down
side
by
side
after
a
space
grani
said
it
grows
cold
frodi
wrapped
him
in
the
guide
cloak
for
another
while
they
sat
silent
until
grani
said
again
i
am
too
weary
to
walk
another
step
yet
if
i
sit
here
i
shall
freeze
frodi
what
can
we
do
frodi
knew
nothing
which
could
be
done
either
we
should
walk
over
the
cliffs
or
die
of
freezing
in
the
first
mile
we
must
stay
here
take
warmth
from
us
they
sat
closer
to
him
but
still
he
was
cold
after
a
while
he
said
i
am
sorry
we
brought
not
our
cloaks
they
answered
nothing
the
snow
heaped
around
them
yet
grani
fell
to
shivering
then
he
said
i
am
sorry
we
turned
not
back
they
still
said
nothing
at
last
grani
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
he
cried
rolf
if
thou
hast
anything
to
say
say
it
before
we
all
die
rolf
answered
i
have
been
thinking
what
is
this
mound
behind
us
there
is
but
one
mound
on
all
the
heaths
answered
grani
men
call
it
the
barrow
of
a
viking
who
died
off
the
coast
and
was
buried
here
with
his
ship
that
he
might
forever
look
out
upon
the
sea
then
said
rolf
there
is
one
thing
we
can
do
and
only
one
to
save
our
lives
and
that
is
to
break
into
the
barrow
so
they
fell
to
digging
with
their
hands
at
the
mound
and
they
could
have
done
nothing
had
the
earth
been
frozen
but
it
was
still
soft
and
they
dug
until
they
came
to
timbers
two
feet
within
the
mound
then
frodi
thrust
his
hands
between
the
timbers
and
strained
at
one
and
rolf
and
grani
tugged
at
his
waist
the
timber
broke
and
they
fell
back
together
in
the
snow
yet
an
entrance
to
the
mound
was
thus
made
and
when
they
had
enlarged
it
rolf
went
in
first
and
the
others
followed
within
the
air
was
dead
and
close
they
stayed
at
the
entrance
to
breathe
yet
the
place
was
warmer
and
it
was
a
great
relief
not
to
feel
the
wind
but
grani
was
still
all
of
a
shiver
so
rolf
went
into
the
mound
further
and
they
heard
him
stumbling
and
slipping
in
the
darkness
after
a
while
he
came
back
to
them
and
said
here
is
wood
for
a
fire
then
they
pulled
stalks
of
grass
and
shook
them
free
of
snow
they
found
in
the
shepherd
cloak
a
flint
and
steel
and
so
made
a
fire
at
the
mouth
of
the
barrow
the
wind
bore
the
smoke
away
and
by
degrees
the
air
cleared
in
the
mound
then
with
brands
they
went
within
and
cast
the
light
about
the
mound
was
made
of
a
a
small
one
which
had
been
borne
there
on
the
shoulders
of
men
it
was
propped
upright
with
stones
and
roofed
over
with
timbers
and
planks
dirt
had
been
cast
over
the
whole
they
climbed
into
that
ship
and
saw
by
the
light
of
the
torches
where
the
old
viking
sat
in
the
stern
he
was
in
such
armor
as
men
had
worn
long
before
he
had
a
helm
on
his
head
and
held
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
was
very
stern
of
face
there
he
sat
as
if
he
were
still
alive
but
there
was
no
sight
in
his
eyes
before
him
in
the
ship
were
precious
things
of
gold
and
silver
cloths
and
weapons
all
the
oars
lay
in
their
places
as
if
ready
for
men
to
use
them
very
strange
was
that
sight
and
those
three
gazed
at
it
in
silence
he
looks
said
frodi
as
if
he
would
walk
illustration
there
he
sat
as
if
he
were
still
alive
but
there
was
no
sight
in
his
eyes
now
said
grani
i
remember
the
shepherds
say
he
has
been
seen
and
lights
have
burned
at
this
mound
sometimes
of
nights
yet
he
has
never
done
harm
if
he
is
ever
to
do
it
he
will
do
it
now
said
rolf
for
he
looks
as
if
he
mislikes
us
here
by
that
time
the
place
was
very
smoky
from
the
torches
so
they
went
back
again
to
the
entrance
and
lay
down
to
sleep
they
took
with
them
cloths
and
broidered
hangings
which
had
lain
by
the
viking
and
with
these
and
the
fire
they
made
themselves
warm
so
very
weary
from
their
walking
they
fell
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
night
rolf
and
grani
waked
and
missed
frodi
from
their
side
moreover
they
heard
a
noise
which
was
not
the
howling
of
the
storm
but
was
like
the
splintering
of
wood
and
the
snarling
of
men
breaths
as
they
wrestled
in
fight
then
rolf
snatched
a
torch
from
the
fire
and
ran
within
the
mound
grani
followed
and
they
climbed
on
board
the
ship
there
lay
frodi
and
the
viking
together
they
had
been
fighting
all
about
the
place
and
the
thwarts
and
oars
were
broken
in
one
place
even
the
bulwark
of
the
ship
was
torn
away
but
frodi
had
forced
the
viking
into
the
seat
where
first
he
had
sat
and
there
frodi
held
him
while
the
viking
struggled
still
glaring
from
glassy
eyes
and
frodi
could
do
naught
but
keep
him
where
he
was
little
more
breath
had
frodi
but
yet
he
held
his
grip
on
the
viking
arms
then
rolf
drew
his
and
sprang
in
at
the
viking
and
hewed
at
the
neck
of
him
so
that
the
head
sprang
off
at
the
stroke
but
no
blood
followed
frodi
lay
and
breathed
deeply
but
rolf
took
the
head
of
the
viking
and
laid
it
at
his
thigh
with
those
heathen
ghosts
which
did
harm
to
man
there
was
no
way
to
quiet
them
except
to
hew
off
the
head
and
lay
it
at
the
thigh
and
such
things
happened
to
many
men
even
as
is
here
told
but
the
greatest
says
sturla
the
lawman
was
grettir
the
strong
when
frodi
had
got
his
breath
they
asked
him
how
all
that
had
come
about
nothing
do
i
know
about
it
answered
frodi
save
that
he
came
and
dragged
me
in
my
sleep
hither
and
sought
to
throttle
me
i
had
much
ado
to
master
him
they
went
back
and
slept
until
the
day
came
but
the
storm
was
still
so
violent
that
they
could
not
travel
then
they
made
larger
the
entrance
to
the
mound
so
that
light
came
into
the
ship
and
they
buried
the
viking
in
the
ground
now
when
they
came
to
examine
his
treasures
grani
and
frodi
were
busy
long
casting
aside
each
thing
for
something
better
but
after
rolf
had
searched
for
only
a
short
while
he
sat
still
and
looked
no
further
grani
saw
that
he
had
something
what
precious
thing
hast
thou
there
asked
he
this
said
rolf
which
i
found
on
the
back
of
the
viking
seat
he
showed
them
a
bow
which
had
hung
there
in
a
leathern
case
of
some
foreign
wood
it
was
tipped
with
horn
and
bound
at
the
middle
with
wire
of
fine
gold
to
form
a
grip
it
seemed
very
strong
cunningly
made
a
wonderful
weapon
and
there
was
a
quiver
with
it
bearing
thirty
arrows
long
and
barbed
for
war
now
said
grani
this
is
far
better
than
jewels
or
fine
cloths
and
it
is
the
best
weapon
here
thou
shalt
give
it
to
me
rolf
gave
him
the
bow
and
when
they
went
again
to
look
out
upon
the
storm
the
clouds
were
breaking
and
sunbeams
were
coming
through
so
they
took
the
bow
and
some
small
gear
and
started
for
hawksness
where
they
found
ar
nigh
wild
for
fear
but
their
coming
made
him
happy
and
grani
told
all
that
had
happened
to
them
said
ar
methinks
thy
thralls
have
saved
thy
life
that
is
true
answered
grani
what
wilt
thou
give
them
asked
ar
whatever
they
wish
answered
grani
he
called
on
rolf
to
say
what
gift
he
would
like
at
his
hands
that
bow
and
those
arrows
said
rolf
now
asked
grani
which
is
dearest
to
thee
that
bow
or
thy
freedom
and
frodi
our
freedom
answered
rolf
your
freedom
shall
you
have
said
grani
then
before
all
who
were
in
the
hall
he
spoke
rolf
and
frodi
free
chapter
xxi
how
rolf
won
the
viking
bow
grani
sent
men
to
the
viking
mound
and
they
fetched
home
all
the
precious
things
which
were
there
whether
gold
silver
cloths
or
weapons
among
these
last
was
the
viking
bill
that
was
a
notable
weapon
having
a
curving
blade
with
a
hook
springing
from
its
back
and
set
like
a
great
spearhead
upon
a
pole
as
high
as
a
shoulder
grani
kept
all
weapons
but
he
gave
rolf
and
frodi
things
to
the
value
of
some
hundreds
in
silver
and
begged
that
they
should
remain
with
him
in
the
hall
of
ar
the
peacock
yet
rolf
bore
himself
as
if
he
expected
more
from
grani
than
gold
and
silver
and
said
he
could
not
stay
in
the
hall
grani
complained
of
that
to
ar
ar
asked
knowest
thou
not
what
he
will
have
of
thee
said
grani
the
bow
belike
not
so
answered
ar
well
grani
said
i
will
make
amends
to
him
by
pressing
him
again
to
live
here
with
us
thou
shalt
never
succeed
with
him
in
that
replied
ar
until
thou
hast
said
those
words
which
will
make
him
forget
that
he
was
once
a
thrall
in
this
place
but
this
i
beg
thee
drive
him
not
away
from
hawksness
for
war
with
the
scots
is
threatened
in
the
spring
and
all
will
be
of
value
so
grani
did
not
press
rolf
to
stay
in
the
hall
and
he
asked
where
will
ye
live
we
go
answered
rolf
to
stay
a
while
with
that
shipmaster
who
has
been
living
here
but
when
they
searched
after
kiartan
it
was
told
that
he
had
gone
with
his
ship
with
great
suddenness
when
he
learned
that
rolf
and
frodi
were
set
free
yet
in
his
haste
he
had
left
merchandise
and
had
outstanding
credits
so
rolf
took
kiartan
lodgings
and
said
he
would
wait
his
return
then
winter
came
on
and
the
place
was
snowed
and
frozen
up
so
that
men
had
nothing
to
do
save
to
hold
sports
on
the
ice
or
to
sit
long
of
evenings
in
the
hall
talking
of
many
things
but
now
all
was
different
from
before
and
rolf
and
grani
came
seldom
together
one
time
when
all
were
at
games
on
the
ice
grani
sent
for
his
bow
and
it
was
brought
out
to
him
men
took
it
and
handled
it
admiring
it
much
let
us
see
said
grani
what
shooting
we
can
do
with
it
he
tried
to
string
the
bow
but
it
was
with
him
as
it
had
been
with
rolf
and
the
bow
of
grettir
it
would
not
bend
for
him
but
was
almost
as
stiff
as
a
spear
shaft
he
got
red
in
the
face
first
with
trying
and
then
with
anger
at
last
he
gave
over
and
said
that
others
should
try
but
though
the
strongest
of
the
orkneyingers
did
their
best
they
could
do
no
better
than
grani
thereat
he
felt
better
and
offered
the
bow
to
frodi
frodi
held
it
in
his
hands
and
turned
it
this
way
and
that
break
it
i
might
quoth
he
but
string
it
never
he
offered
the
bow
to
rolf
saying
do
thou
try
it
for
i
have
seen
thee
do
with
skill
what
others
have
failed
to
do
with
force
but
rolf
would
not
try
to
string
the
bow
so
grani
sent
it
back
to
the
hall
and
let
bring
the
viking
bill
which
had
lain
by
his
side
in
the
ship
but
when
it
was
brought
it
proved
too
heavy
for
any
of
the
orkneyingers
to
wield
then
said
grani
i
will
give
the
bill
as
a
present
to
why
callest
thou
me
that
asked
frodi
grani
only
said
why
should
i
not
call
thee
so
and
he
pressed
the
bill
on
frodi
who
drew
back
i
know
nothing
of
weapons
said
he
then
all
the
orkneyingers
shouted
to
see
the
strongest
man
drawing
away
from
the
bill
and
when
grani
made
him
take
it
they
laughed
the
more
for
he
handled
it
said
all
as
if
it
were
the
smithy
broom
they
called
him
after
that
thinking
it
fine
that
he
who
could
master
a
spirit
could
not
handle
a
weapon
now
in
that
winter
ar
was
continually
sick
with
little
fevers
and
he
would
not
let
grani
stir
far
from
his
side
one
day
a
messenger
from
earl
brusi
came
to
say
that
ar
should
keep
a
watch
for
vemund
the
pitiless
who
had
been
driven
from
the
north
and
had
gone
toward
the
south
now
no
one
needed
to
be
told
who
vemund
was
for
he
was
the
worst
of
all
vikings
who
had
ravaged
in
the
orkneys
since
he
not
only
took
tribute
but
burnt
towns
and
slaughtered
people
wantonly
a
baresark
he
was
with
the
strength
of
seven
men
and
so
defended
by
magic
that
on
him
no
steel
might
bite
only
twenty
men
had
he
with
him
but
they
had
the
power
of
fifty
being
baresarks
all
outlawed
and
reckless
of
life
they
had
first
done
great
damage
in
norway
but
were
driven
thence
to
the
shetland
isles
and
thence
to
the
northern
orkneys
but
now
were
coming
further
south
rewards
and
fame
were
sure
to
the
men
who
could
overcome
those
baresarks
grani
begged
of
ar
that
he
might
go
in
the
in
search
of
them
but
ar
said
no
to
that
ar
gave
orders
that
sweyn
should
keep
the
ship
in
readiness
men
slept
near
the
ready
to
launch
her
day
or
night
one
night
in
a
storm
fire
was
seen
on
that
island
which
is
off
hawksness
where
dwell
only
the
cottages
were
seen
to
burn
to
the
ground
but
the
sea
was
high
and
no
one
crossed
over
in
the
morning
a
boat
left
that
little
island
and
went
away
eastward
that
was
a
venturesome
thing
in
a
storm
and
by
that
deed
that
was
known
for
the
boat
of
vemund
the
pitiless
then
sweyn
let
launch
the
and
with
all
his
men
went
after
the
baresarks
rolf
made
no
offer
to
go
and
grani
watched
the
chase
from
the
shore
angry
that
he
must
stay
the
two
ships
drove
away
out
of
sight
and
no
one
could
say
that
the
larger
gained
upon
the
smaller
nothing
more
was
seen
of
them
all
that
day
but
in
the
night
the
baresarks
gave
sweyn
the
slip
they
came
straight
back
as
they
had
gone
but
sweyn
went
on
first
east
then
south
searching
the
coast
vemund
ship
came
to
hawksness
and
in
the
morning
behold
there
it
was
off
the
landing
and
the
baresarks
were
just
rowing
it
to
shore
the
left
their
cottages
and
ran
to
the
hall
and
all
took
hasty
counsel
but
when
word
was
brought
to
ar
of
the
baresarks
first
he
became
red
in
the
face
and
then
he
lost
power
of
speech
and
there
was
no
leader
save
grani
grani
said
this
is
no
place
for
us
to
stay
for
the
baresarks
will
burn
us
alive
take
ar
and
the
women
and
children
into
the
stone
church
and
let
us
men
go
also
thither
and
defend
it
then
that
was
done
and
when
they
reached
the
church
going
hastily
and
in
a
body
so
that
none
should
be
left
behind
they
found
rolf
and
frodi
sitting
at
the
door
with
their
weapons
then
all
went
within
the
church
but
rolf
and
frodi
stayed
outside
come
ye
not
inside
asked
grani
all
those
riches
which
ar
has
in
his
hall
responded
rolf
are
those
to
be
burned
or
lost
then
grani
said
he
would
go
back
again
and
called
for
men
to
help
defend
the
hall
only
nine
came
but
those
with
rolf
and
frodi
went
back
to
the
hall
both
the
hall
and
the
church
were
barred
against
the
baresarks
those
outlaws
came
up
into
the
place
a
strange
crew
they
were
wearing
no
armor
but
skins
of
beasts
and
wild
to
look
on
they
burned
some
huts
but
the
church
and
the
hall
they
might
not
force
then
because
they
feared
sweyn
return
and
so
dared
not
to
lose
time
they
knew
not
what
to
do
men
shot
at
them
from
the
hall
and
the
church
so
the
baresarks
went
back
again
to
the
shore
and
took
counsel
together
now
all
the
time
in
the
hall
frodi
had
walked
up
and
down
looking
very
white
and
knocking
his
bill
against
everything
as
if
he
were
afraid
so
when
the
outlaws
went
away
grani
scoffed
at
him
what
dost
thou
with
that
bill
asked
grani
if
thou
canst
not
stand
up
like
a
man
and
be
ready
for
what
comes
truly
answered
frodi
i
feel
strange
inwardly
and
my
hands
are
cold
yet
what
dost
thou
with
that
bow
which
is
so
handsome
that
man
never
saw
finer
yet
which
no
one
in
these
islands
has
yet
strung
then
grani
took
the
quiver
from
his
shoulders
and
laid
down
the
bow
i
am
justly
rebuked
said
he
he
took
a
lighter
bow
now
wilt
thou
take
a
smaller
weapon
no
man
can
say
answered
frodi
what
he
will
do
in
time
of
trial
but
i
will
keep
the
bill
now
some
voice
was
heard
without
calling
they
listened
to
what
was
said
that
was
a
messenger
from
vemund
who
made
this
offer
a
champion
should
be
sent
out
by
the
orkneyingers
to
meet
vemund
and
whichever
champion
should
fall
his
side
should
yield
itself
into
the
other
hands
but
if
the
orkneyingers
refused
fire
should
be
set
to
the
hall
and
also
to
the
roof
of
the
church
and
that
was
the
same
as
offering
them
one
small
chance
for
their
lives
grani
asked
what
man
will
go
out
against
vemund
no
one
offered
then
grani
said
he
who
goes
against
the
baresark
will
die
swiftest
therefore
i
am
willing
to
go
myself
all
the
orkneyingers
cried
out
against
that
saying
they
should
die
together
within
the
hall
it
might
be
sweyn
would
come
in
time
to
save
them
then
rolf
spoke
and
said
no
man
in
this
place
not
even
frodi
our
strongest
will
have
any
chance
against
vemund
so
long
as
we
fight
with
steel
weapons
for
i
have
heard
the
ways
of
such
men
to
be
these
before
fighting
they
look
upon
the
weapons
of
the
other
champion
and
when
they
look
by
witchcraft
they
make
steel
or
iron
powerless
against
them
such
a
man
is
vemund
named
yet
if
thou
grani
wilt
give
me
what
i
desire
i
will
find
a
way
to
slay
him
anything
i
have
answered
grani
is
thine
give
me
then
said
rolf
the
bow
and
arrows
of
the
viking
then
grani
gave
him
the
bow
and
the
quiver
and
rolf
cried
to
the
messenger
to
say
to
vemund
that
in
half
an
hour
one
would
meet
him
with
the
bow
at
that
great
laughter
rose
among
the
outlaws
and
those
in
the
hall
and
in
the
church
felt
no
confidence
in
rolf
but
he
said
to
frodi
go
to
the
forge
and
heat
it
and
he
said
to
grani
bring
me
here
some
silver
then
when
the
forge
was
heated
and
the
silver
was
brought
rolf
said
to
frodi
make
me
now
three
silver
arrowheads
the
best
thou
canst
after
the
pattern
of
these
here
in
the
quiver
so
frodi
made
the
quickly
and
with
great
skill
so
that
no
one
could
have
told
them
apart
from
the
of
iron
for
they
were
black
from
the
fire
and
rolf
first
set
a
dish
of
to
heat
by
the
forge
and
then
took
the
heads
from
three
of
the
arrows
when
the
new
were
made
rolf
bound
them
with
sinews
upon
the
shafts
a
man
said
but
what
wilt
thou
do
with
the
arrows
if
thou
canst
not
string
the
bow
rolf
answered
nothing
he
took
the
and
oiled
those
three
arrows
then
he
heated
the
oil
hotter
and
began
to
rub
it
on
the
bow
first
he
oiled
the
string
and
rubbed
it
long
then
he
oiled
the
wood
and
the
wood
became
darker
with
the
oil
and
took
a
finer
polish
fresher
it
seemed
gleaming
in
the
light
of
the
forge
rolf
rubbed
for
many
minutes
and
the
bow
became
ever
darker
he
held
it
then
over
the
forge
turning
it
in
every
way
and
it
took
to
itself
the
fire
of
the
coals
then
rolf
oiled
the
string
once
more
heating
it
as
well
and
at
last
they
saw
he
meant
to
string
the
bow
against
his
foot
he
set
it
and
bent
it
and
slipped
the
string
up
to
the
notch
it
seemed
as
if
a
child
could
have
done
the
deed
and
the
men
burst
out
with
a
shout
then
rolf
took
one
of
the
old
arrows
and
set
it
on
the
string
he
drew
the
bow
and
shot
the
arrow
along
the
hall
no
one
could
see
that
it
dropped
in
its
flight
but
it
struck
an
oaken
beam
by
the
high
seat
and
when
men
came
to
measure
it
afterward
the
arrow
had
entered
the
oak
by
the
breadth
of
a
palm
men
spoke
afterward
of
the
sweet
twang
of
that
bow
like
as
if
it
were
an
harp
then
the
orkneyingers
went
out
of
the
hall
with
much
shouting
and
stood
upon
a
knoll
which
was
between
the
hall
and
the
church
the
baresarks
came
near
and
vemund
stood
out
before
them
he
was
a
huge
man
very
hairy
with
a
great
beard
he
asked
who
was
to
come
against
him
i
answered
rolf
vemund
laughed
and
the
other
baresarks
also
calling
rolf
a
boy
let
me
see
thy
weapons
said
vemund
rolf
showed
him
his
quiver
and
the
baresark
touched
the
point
of
each
arrow
with
his
finger
wilt
thou
look
upon
my
weapons
asked
vemund
rolf
said
he
would
not
now
said
he
withdraw
thy
men
to
the
beach
and
let
us
begin
thou
art
eager
for
death
said
vemund
with
a
grin
i
will
do
as
thou
sayest
and
then
will
come
at
thee
thou
mayest
shoot
as
soon
as
thou
wilt
vemund
withdrew
his
men
to
the
beach
and
the
orkneyingers
went
aside
from
the
knoll
frodi
wept
before
he
left
rolf
commending
him
to
god
then
rolf
took
those
three
arrows
with
silver
points
and
stuck
them
in
the
ground
by
his
feet
by
then
vemund
was
ready
to
return
he
bore
no
shield
nor
armor
he
threw
down
his
bow
and
shouted
that
this
should
be
between
whatever
weapons
each
man
chose
then
with
sword
in
hand
he
began
to
walk
to
the
knoll
rolf
took
an
arrow
from
his
quiver
and
laid
it
on
the
string
when
vemund
was
nearer
rolf
drew
the
bow
no
bow
had
ever
drawn
harder
yet
none
had
been
so
lively
in
his
hand
the
arrow
sped
vemund
turned
not
aside
but
when
the
shaft
struck
on
his
breast
the
wood
flew
to
splinters
and
the
point
fell
down
all
the
orkneymen
cried
out
in
fear
but
the
baresarks
shouted
rolf
took
a
second
arrow
and
waited
awhile
then
he
shot
again
and
the
arrow
struck
vemund
on
the
throat
it
turned
aside
and
flew
sliddering
away
some
of
the
orkneymen
withdrew
to
the
door
of
the
church
crying
that
they
should
be
let
in
but
the
outlaws
began
to
come
forward
then
rolf
drew
one
of
those
arrows
from
the
ground
and
wiped
the
point
and
made
ready
when
vemund
was
twenty
paces
away
rolf
shot
for
the
third
time
the
arrow
went
in
a
level
flight
and
struck
vemund
on
the
breast
there
it
sunk
to
the
feathers
those
baresarks
coming
behind
saw
a
foot
of
the
shaft
stand
out
from
vemund
back
then
vemund
brandished
his
sword
and
ran
at
rolf
rolf
took
the
second
arrow
and
sent
it
at
him
in
the
eye
it
struck
him
and
pierced
to
the
brain
down
fell
the
baresark
and
died
before
he
reached
the
ground
rolf
took
the
third
arrow
and
put
it
in
his
quiver
then
the
orkneyingers
came
running
from
the
church
with
their
weapons
and
all
rushed
at
the
outlaws
grani
shouted
that
the
baresarks
should
lay
down
their
arms
but
they
fearing
death
drew
into
a
circle
and
would
not
yield
they
began
to
cast
spears
at
the
orkneyingers
shoot
arrows
at
them
said
grani
to
rolf
i
have
done
my
share
quoth
he
then
the
orkneyingers
ran
round
that
circle
of
outlaws
and
did
their
best
to
pry
into
it
but
they
got
only
wounds
the
baresarks
began
to
grit
their
teeth
and
work
themselves
to
anger
as
if
they
had
been
wolves
that
was
their
way
in
battle
frodi
went
nearer
to
look
at
that
sight
then
one
baresark
shot
a
spear
at
frodi
and
cut
his
shoulder
so
that
it
bled
at
that
frodi
turned
red
and
took
his
bill
and
went
at
that
man
the
baresark
swung
his
sword
but
frodi
caught
it
with
the
bill
and
spun
it
aloft
then
he
hooked
at
the
man
with
the
back
of
the
bill
and
caught
him
by
the
neck
and
pulled
him
down
grovelling
an
orkneyman
pierced
the
outlaw
as
he
lay
so
the
circle
of
the
baresarks
was
broken
but
they
sought
to
draw
again
together
then
frodi
took
his
bill
and
made
at
the
two
men
to
right
and
left
of
the
opening
one
he
caught
with
the
point
of
the
bill
and
pitched
him
sideways
that
man
fell
on
the
circle
at
another
place
and
broke
it
there
next
frodi
pitched
the
other
baresark
clean
across
the
circle
against
the
men
at
the
other
side
two
fell
at
once
then
grani
shouted
and
rushed
within
the
ring
and
all
the
orkneyingers
fell
on
the
baresarks
at
every
point
some
were
slain
right
there
some
broke
away
and
were
chased
about
one
by
one
they
died
among
the
huts
and
the
frames
for
drying
fish
frodi
when
he
had
done
that
much
stood
by
rolf
and
struck
no
more
when
the
fighting
was
finished
the
orkneyingers
looked
to
their
hurts
and
it
was
found
that
no
one
was
badly
wounded
all
said
that
the
death
of
vemund
the
pitiless
was
not
so
bad
by
half
as
the
living
of
him
now
grani
was
very
happy
and
talkative
and
he
praised
his
men
much
but
he
seemed
constrained
before
rolf
and
spoke
to
frodi
and
thou
saidst
thou
couldst
not
use
the
bill
frodi
answered
so
i
thought
but
it
is
no
different
from
handling
a
pitchfork
grani
whooped
with
laughter
and
would
tell
that
saying
to
others
frodi
beseeched
him
cease
thy
talking
lest
men
give
me
a
new
nickname
but
grani
told
frodi
words
in
the
presence
of
many
and
all
cried
that
frodi
should
be
called
pitchfork
frodi
he
grumbled
to
rolf
thereat
better
be
glad
said
rolf
that
nothing
worse
has
come
to
thee
than
a
sore
shoulder
and
a
new
name
now
sweyn
came
sailing
back
angered
that
he
had
been
tricked
but
much
afraid
of
what
might
have
happened
at
hawksness
in
his
absence
as
for
ar
the
peacock
he
lay
without
speech
until
the
morrow
when
he
came
to
himself
but
he
was
a
broken
man
ever
after
that
shock
grani
took
the
spoil
from
the
baresark
ship
and
divided
it
into
five
parts
two
parts
he
gave
to
those
fishers
whose
houses
the
baresarks
had
burned
one
part
he
divided
among
those
who
had
wounds
the
rest
he
sent
to
the
lodging
of
rolf
and
frodi
grani
took
nothing
for
himself
nor
did
he
go
with
the
treasure
to
rolf
and
men
said
among
themselves
that
during
all
these
doings
rolf
and
grani
had
spoken
to
each
other
only
when
they
must
from
that
time
the
viking
bow
was
rolf
own
those
two
arrows
which
had
slain
the
baresark
were
hung
up
in
the
church
but
rolf
took
the
third
arrow
with
the
silver
point
and
bound
it
in
the
quiver
with
a
silken
thread
chapter
xxii
now
kiartan
returns
as
weakness
grew
on
him
ar
the
peacock
kept
grani
much
by
his
side
one
day
ar
said
i
see
that
thou
art
troubled
at
times
is
aught
weighing
on
thee
grani
answered
rolf
is
on
my
mind
ar
said
put
away
the
thought
of
him
that
i
can
not
do
replied
grani
for
i
feel
i
did
wrong
in
enthralling
him
and
i
can
not
be
easy
until
he
hath
forgiven
me
meseems
quoth
ar
that
thou
expectest
rolf
to
come
and
say
forgive
thee
before
ever
thou
hast
shown
him
that
thou
art
sorry
grani
answered
nothing
go
now
said
ar
and
seek
him
out
confess
thyself
in
the
wrong
it
is
hard
to
do
that
responded
grani
thou
art
well
named
grani
the
proud
said
ar
but
then
he
added
never
have
i
blamed
thee
till
now
but
thou
shouldst
have
done
this
thing
at
the
very
first
and
the
longer
this
estrangement
lasts
the
harder
it
will
be
to
forget
grani
made
no
answer
but
communed
for
a
while
with
himself
though
it
was
hard
to
his
pride
at
last
he
decided
to
humble
himself
before
rolf
he
went
to
the
dwelling
of
rolf
and
frodi
they
were
on
the
headland
watching
the
fishing
fleet
and
thither
grani
followed
he
sat
down
at
the
edge
of
the
cliff
beside
those
two
and
had
speech
with
frodi
but
between
him
and
rolf
passed
at
the
first
only
the
frodi
asked
war
with
the
scots
is
expected
in
the
spring
aye
answered
grani
i
would
i
were
in
iceland
frodi
said
oh
ye
icelanders
cried
grani
why
is
it
ye
always
burn
to
return
whether
ye
love
your
foggy
isle
and
plain
men
more
or
our
realm
less
in
your
realm
answered
frodi
there
are
three
pests
which
no
icelander
can
bear
the
first
is
your
baresarks
which
in
iceland
are
held
in
restraint
but
here
they
go
at
large
the
second
is
your
vikings
which
dare
not
come
to
us
but
here
they
harry
the
coasts
and
the
third
is
the
habit
of
burning
a
man
in
his
house
which
by
us
has
been
done
some
few
times
in
great
matters
yet
is
always
punished
but
here
it
is
done
in
any
little
quarrel
and
little
shame
is
felt
for
it
and
if
i
leave
this
land
without
being
burned
then
i
am
lucky
grani
laughed
and
then
rolf
spoke
quoth
he
and
as
for
our
land
of
simple
men
against
thy
realm
of
kings
and
earls
all
i
know
is
that
with
us
there
is
law
to
restrain
all
men
but
if
thy
earls
fall
out
then
the
orkneys
are
rent
with
war
and
at
all
times
your
lives
lie
in
the
power
of
the
scots
who
any
summer
day
may
come
and
sweep
the
land
nay
the
winter
is
open
why
may
they
not
fall
upon
us
now
it
is
possible
said
frodi
but
grani
had
nothing
to
reply
and
consider
this
rolf
said
thou
art
grani
fosterling
of
ar
the
thane
thou
hast
honor
and
a
part
of
all
spoils
are
thine
but
ar
is
coming
to
his
end
and
some
day
another
thane
will
rule
here
when
thy
honors
fall
away
and
thou
must
take
thy
place
like
other
men
how
then
wilt
thou
think
of
the
doings
of
kings
and
earls
i
fear
no
misfortune
answered
grani
then
quoth
rolf
thou
art
fitted
to
be
an
icelander
and
now
i
will
say
what
i
have
many
times
thought
that
thy
speech
is
more
of
iceland
than
of
this
place
whence
did
ar
take
thee
grani
grew
red
but
answered
thou
hidest
thy
parentage
true
replied
rolf
now
i
crave
thy
pardon
for
questioning
thee
that
was
the
end
of
that
talk
for
rolf
drew
within
himself
and
grani
felt
shame
that
he
could
not
ask
pardon
so
easily
as
the
icelander
and
the
more
he
looked
on
rolf
countenance
the
more
it
seemed
that
they
should
be
friends
he
ceased
speaking
and
sat
with
his
back
half
turned
trying
to
say
the
words
but
for
a
long
time
they
would
not
come
at
length
he
said
rolf
aye
rolf
answered
grani
said
nothing
for
a
while
more
at
length
again
he
said
rolf
what
is
it
rolf
asked
but
for
a
second
time
grani
could
not
bring
himself
to
speak
yet
at
last
he
made
ready
to
speak
without
fail
and
ask
forgiveness
and
the
words
were
on
his
tongue
then
suddenly
rolf
rose
and
pointed
out
upon
the
water
where
a
ship
had
come
into
view
and
he
cried
at
last
cometh
he
for
whom
i
have
waited
no
need
to
ask
whose
ship
that
was
for
grani
saw
that
it
was
kiartan
and
weakly
he
put
aside
the
chance
to
set
himself
right
with
rolf
and
inquired
instead
why
rolf
waited
there
for
kiartan
so
long
tell
me
first
responded
rolf
why
he
cometh
in
such
haste
with
oars
and
sails
both
he
thinks
that
by
this
time
i
am
surely
gone
but
his
debts
and
goods
will
not
flee
from
him
and
he
hath
hours
before
sunset
to
make
the
harbor
can
he
be
pursued
by
aught
let
us
watch
the
headland
to
the
eastward
there
comes
another
ship
cried
frodi
they
watched
that
ship
appear
a
long
and
low
grani
cried
that
that
must
be
a
viking
and
was
for
running
to
the
hall
but
rolf
bade
him
wait
then
there
came
a
second
and
two
more
together
and
then
a
great
ship
very
large
after
that
the
nose
of
yet
another
vessel
pushed
around
the
headland
is
earl
thorfinn
asked
grani
coming
to
visit
his
realm
why
should
kiartan
responded
rolf
flee
before
the
earl
who
hath
sold
him
permission
to
trade
here
that
is
the
fleet
of
the
scots
more
of
them
are
in
sight
said
frodi
so
they
stayed
only
long
enough
to
see
that
the
fisher
fleet
leaving
nets
and
lines
was
hurrying
to
the
shore
those
three
left
the
headland
and
ran
to
hawksness
there
they
told
the
tidings
and
gathered
men
arming
all
those
who
came
to
the
hall
the
women
were
sent
into
the
church
with
the
children
but
the
men
went
down
to
the
beach
there
the
fishermen
first
made
a
landing
and
hurried
for
their
arms
but
when
all
were
gathered
together
they
were
very
few
against
what
must
be
the
might
of
the
scots
then
the
ship
of
kiartan
neared
the
shore
frodi
said
to
rolf
before
the
scots
come
there
will
be
time
to
claim
thy
due
of
him
not
in
the
face
of
this
danger
answered
rolf
kiartan
ran
his
ship
upon
the
beach
and
his
men
leaped
out
and
pushed
her
higher
up
the
shingle
kiartan
ran
to
ar
and
begged
protection
fight
thou
with
us
quoth
ar
we
shall
be
but
six
score
against
six
hundred
kiartan
turned
pale
and
bit
his
fingers
frodi
said
he
is
as
big
a
coward
as
i
grani
laughed
now
when
the
scots
neared
the
shore
the
people
gave
way
from
the
beach
and
drew
a
little
up
the
hillside
and
the
nearer
the
scots
came
the
more
the
orkneymen
withdrew
then
when
the
scots
were
landing
some
of
the
hawksness
men
threw
away
their
arms
and
sat
down
where
they
were
and
some
fled
away
to
the
downs
and
the
heather
where
they
might
hide
but
ar
said
he
would
not
flee
and
went
back
again
to
fight
those
who
went
with
him
were
only
grani
and
sweyn
and
rolf
and
frodi
followed
behind
this
is
no
icelanders
quarrel
said
ar
we
go
to
die
but
the
scots
will
give
you
peace
nevertheless
we
will
look
on
a
while
answered
rolf
then
ar
took
his
stand
on
that
knoll
whence
rolf
had
slain
the
baresark
he
had
his
church
and
his
hall
at
his
back
and
thinking
to
die
as
became
a
man
he
seemed
to
gain
his
strength
again
and
shot
arrows
in
marvellous
wise
twenty
he
sent
among
the
scots
as
they
landed
and
hurt
a
man
with
each
then
he
took
his
spear
and
waited
for
the
scots
to
come
nearer
now
said
frodi
to
rolf
shall
we
stay
or
go
if
we
stay
answered
rolf
we
never
see
iceland
again
yet
i
have
not
the
heart
to
leave
those
three
as
they
stand
there
so
he
and
frodi
drew
still
nearer
to
ar
and
stood
at
his
back
but
some
archer
in
the
fleet
sent
forth
a
shaft
and
it
smote
ar
in
the
throat
it
smote
him
and
he
fell
like
a
man
he
died
there
near
his
father
hall
and
the
scots
shouting
began
to
come
forward
flee
said
sweyn
to
grani
wilt
thou
flee
asked
grani
a
spear
struck
sweyn
in
the
leg
and
down
he
sat
here
i
stay
quoth
he
then
here
stay
i
answered
grani
but
those
who
had
thrown
down
their
arms
ran
to
grani
in
a
crowd
and
cried
that
he
should
not
stay
to
be
killed
some
bore
sweyn
within
the
church
where
no
scot
would
slay
him
before
the
altar
and
when
grani
saw
that
he
suffered
himself
to
be
pushed
away
so
he
came
to
the
hillside
before
ever
the
scots
reached
him
and
when
they
began
to
shoot
at
him
with
arrows
he
ran
and
rolf
and
frodi
ran
along
the
hillside
a
little
higher
up
now
the
scots
sent
swift
archers
in
chase
grani
was
armed
and
had
heavy
weapons
frodi
was
slow
and
rolf
would
not
leave
him
so
the
archers
began
to
come
up
on
them
and
it
looked
bad
for
them
grani
knew
the
country
he
sought
the
best
ways
calling
to
rolf
that
they
should
meet
at
the
vale
of
the
hermit
then
he
threw
off
his
mail
and
ran
freely
and
shook
off
his
pursuers
in
a
little
wood
but
in
that
same
wood
rolf
took
the
wrong
course
for
thinking
he
knew
the
way
to
the
vale
he
led
frodi
where
should
be
a
glen
with
a
growth
of
nothing
was
there
of
the
kind
but
a
bare
hillside
rose
where
was
no
cover
and
the
scots
began
to
shout
as
they
saw
them
close
in
front
now
grani
knew
the
way
better
when
he
reached
the
copse
he
stood
and
looked
where
rolf
and
frodi
ran
on
the
hillside
above
him
then
he
heard
a
panting
and
looked
down
there
was
kiartan
hiding
in
the
fern
look
up
now
said
grani
and
see
who
runneth
there
above
us
when
kiartan
saw
rolf
first
he
started
and
then
he
looked
sidewise
at
grani
they
can
never
escape
said
he
i
will
call
them
hither
replied
grani
that
will
bring
us
in
danger
kiartan
cried
but
grani
leaped
upon
a
boulder
and
prepared
to
shout
then
as
he
stood
there
kiartan
snatched
up
a
billet
of
wood
and
smote
at
him
from
the
side
foul
was
that
assault
the
stroke
fell
on
the
shoulder
but
grani
twisted
his
arm
and
cast
the
billet
aside
he
smote
in
return
and
kiartan
fell
so
grani
shouted
aloud
to
rolf
who
stood
on
the
hillside
with
frodi
and
studied
his
road
so
many
copses
did
rolf
see
that
he
knew
not
where
to
go
for
most
were
but
small
clumps
where
was
no
safety
and
only
one
led
to
the
hidden
winding
watercourse
and
the
secluded
dell
but
when
he
heard
grani
and
saw
him
he
turned
thither
although
he
must
go
back
a
little
way
he
and
frodi
ran
hastily
rushing
down
the
hillside
with
much
speed
and
they
saw
they
could
avoid
all
but
one
of
the
scots
that
man
had
run
wide
of
their
track
flanking
them
lest
they
should
double
back
now
he
ran
in
on
them
and
prepared
to
strike
with
his
sword
on
that
slope
was
no
good
footing
but
the
scot
braced
himself
where
the
icelanders
must
pass
and
they
could
hardly
both
escape
him
without
a
wound
but
when
rolf
rushed
down
on
him
with
sword
raised
and
those
two
looked
into
each
other
eyes
then
the
scot
did
not
strike
but
stood
like
stone
neither
did
rolf
smite
but
frodi
struck
hard
with
the
butt
of
his
bill
they
left
that
scot
lying
in
a
heap
and
sped
downward
into
the
hollow
there
they
found
grani
with
kiartan
and
grani
had
bound
the
shipmaster
hands
behind
his
back
hastily
they
went
into
the
copse
driving
kiartan
before
them
they
found
the
crooked
watercourse
and
followed
it
among
the
stones
it
was
dry
and
they
wet
not
their
feet
so
in
a
while
they
came
to
a
little
dell
nestled
among
the
hills
the
place
was
called
the
vale
of
the
hermit
but
no
one
lived
there
only
in
one
place
had
been
a
farm
the
hall
had
been
burned
but
a
storehouse
still
stood
stout
against
the
weather
thither
they
went
and
rested
knowing
that
no
scot
could
find
them
in
that
place
grani
loosed
kiartan
and
bade
him
gather
wood
and
if
thou
seekest
to
flee
thou
wilt
carry
an
arrow
in
the
ribs
make
a
fire
for
i
see
beef
is
in
the
storehouse
drying
and
the
green
hide
hangs
against
the
wall
we
will
sup
so
kiartan
gathered
wood
and
made
a
fire
one
thing
i
fail
to
understand
said
frodi
to
rolf
why
neither
thou
nor
that
scot
smote
at
the
other
and
it
was
left
to
me
to
knock
him
down
that
was
strange
to
me
also
said
grani
rolf
said
i
knew
that
man
and
he
was
malcolm
my
father
thrall
for
very
astonishment
we
could
not
strike
then
i
gave
him
a
headache
quoth
frodi
to
make
him
remember
his
manner
of
gaining
his
freedom
preserve
me
from
such
headaches
as
thou
dealest
said
rolf
the
butt
of
thy
bill
is
worse
than
the
point
then
grani
told
why
he
had
bound
kiartan
and
now
said
he
thou
canst
take
on
him
thy
vengeance
whatever
that
may
be
call
him
here
said
rolf
so
kiartan
was
called
thither
and
crouched
thereby
it
was
plain
that
he
expected
to
be
killed
in
what
has
he
offended
thee
asked
grani
now
answered
rolf
that
which
i
say
in
his
hearing
will
be
to
him
the
worst
part
of
his
punishment
he
is
my
uncle
and
through
him
my
father
came
to
his
death
but
when
they
looked
to
see
him
weep
or
hear
him
blame
himself
kiartan
rose
and
thanked
them
that
his
life
was
spared
in
loathing
they
bade
him
go
into
the
storehouse
and
lie
then
they
laid
themselves
down
inside
the
door
and
slept
for
the
sake
of
air
they
left
the
door
wide
in
the
morning
they
found
that
kiartan
was
gone
and
while
they
were
asking
where
he
might
be
they
heard
his
voice
at
a
little
distance
saying
that
there
those
three
lay
in
that
storehouse
and
the
scots
should
slay
them
then
was
heard
the
rush
of
feet
chapter
xxiii
of
the
coming
of
earl
thorfinn
rolf
shut
the
storehouse
door
and
frodi
held
it
until
it
was
barred
the
scots
could
move
neither
frodi
nor
the
bars
and
knew
not
what
to
do
all
within
was
dark
save
for
light
from
the
crack
of
the
door
and
when
the
scots
who
stood
before
the
crack
felt
frodi
bill
they
stood
back
then
rolf
shot
arrows
out
through
the
crack
and
the
scots
stood
aside
so
that
those
within
could
do
no
more
they
heard
the
scots
say
that
no
time
should
be
wasted
for
three
men
now
said
frodi
they
will
go
away
be
not
too
hopeful
said
grani
when
smoke
began
to
puff
in
they
knew
that
the
thatch
had
been
fired
over
their
heads
so
quoth
frodi
i
shall
be
burned
in
the
orkneys
after
all
seest
thou
grani
why
no
icelander
loves
thy
land
they
sat
there
a
while
and
the
place
grew
hot
then
grani
began
to
pace
up
and
down
would
that
i
he
said
at
last
had
never
seen
the
orkneys
what
is
this
asked
rolf
grani
said
after
a
silence
i
shall
never
speak
again
to
my
father
whom
i
have
not
seen
these
many
years
next
he
said
my
sister
must
be
almost
a
woman
after
that
said
he
peaceful
was
our
home
frodi
tried
to
comfort
him
but
grani
would
not
listen
let
us
die
in
the
open
he
cried
and
give
an
account
of
ourselves
but
when
they
tried
to
leave
that
smothering
place
they
found
the
scots
had
braced
the
door
and
it
could
not
be
moved
then
a
corner
of
the
roof
fell
down
and
burned
inside
the
storehouse
now
cried
grani
in
despair
would
i
were
once
more
on
the
of
fellstead
looking
abroad
on
old
broadfirth
and
the
peaceful
dales
a
wonderful
thing
thou
sayest
exclaimed
rolf
let
wonders
be
said
frodi
but
since
we
can
not
leave
this
place
by
the
front
door
why
not
by
the
rear
how
do
that
asked
grani
frodi
drew
aside
the
heavy
hide
which
hung
at
the
back
of
the
storehouse
against
the
rock
of
the
hillside
there
were
a
carved
stone
doorway
and
a
black
cave
now
cried
grani
rightly
is
this
place
called
the
vale
of
the
hermit
this
was
his
house
though
i
never
knew
of
it
till
now
let
us
be
quick
so
they
went
into
that
cave
and
sat
there
while
the
fire
burned
the
storehouse
quite
away
and
its
fell
across
the
door
of
the
cave
and
hid
it
moreover
the
green
hide
did
not
burn
through
and
kept
out
the
smoke
and
a
little
air
came
in
through
a
fissure
of
the
rock
then
the
scots
who
watched
went
their
way
and
kiartan
with
them
when
they
were
gone
those
three
thrust
the
hide
and
the
beams
aside
from
the
and
leaped
out
over
the
embers
they
were
near
stifled
and
weak
from
the
heat
those
scots
and
kiartan
went
back
to
hawksness
and
for
what
he
had
done
they
gave
him
his
ship
unplundered
but
they
plundered
the
hall
and
the
church
and
with
the
riches
of
ar
they
had
both
sport
and
quarrels
until
all
was
divided
then
they
sent
out
vessels
to
ravage
in
the
orkneys
but
the
main
body
and
the
leader
sat
there
at
hawksness
and
because
it
was
believed
earl
thorfinn
thought
them
still
in
scotland
and
no
ship
had
been
spared
to
go
south
and
tell
of
them
they
had
no
fear
of
him
for
it
would
have
been
a
great
undertaking
for
any
small
boat
to
cross
the
pentland
firth
but
on
a
day
when
the
earl
sat
in
his
hall
in
thurso
of
caithness
his
men
came
to
him
saying
there
are
messengers
without
and
they
would
speak
with
thee
but
the
men
laughed
why
laugh
ye
asked
the
earl
the
messengers
say
they
are
from
the
orkneys
yet
no
ship
has
come
and
they
are
the
worst
of
scarecrows
but
bring
them
in
said
the
earl
so
three
men
were
brought
before
the
earl
one
was
of
middle
height
and
slender
he
bore
a
bow
one
was
taller
and
carried
a
sword
the
third
was
as
big
as
any
man
in
that
place
and
he
held
in
his
hand
a
great
bill
all
in
rags
were
those
men
as
if
their
garments
had
been
scorched
they
told
the
earl
that
the
scots
were
in
the
orkneys
and
the
earl
men
laughed
mightily
sailed
ye
across
the
firth
asked
the
earl
we
rowed
answered
they
in
what
asked
the
earl
and
where
is
the
boat
it
sunk
off
the
shore
said
those
men
and
we
swam
the
last
mile
why
are
ye
so
burned
they
said
they
had
been
nigh
burned
to
death
then
the
earl
stilled
the
laughter
of
his
men
and
he
leaned
to
that
one
who
bore
the
bow
he
was
not
much
more
than
a
lad
where
didst
thou
get
asked
the
earl
that
which
thou
wearest
for
i
know
the
weapon
well
since
once
it
belonged
to
earl
sigurd
my
father
that
may
be
so
said
the
lad
but
it
was
given
me
out
in
iceland
now
said
the
earl
i
know
the
man
to
whom
my
father
gave
the
sword
and
he
went
out
to
iceland
tell
me
what
man
gave
it
thee
if
the
name
is
the
same
then
will
i
believe
this
news
of
thine
but
if
the
name
is
different
then
ye
three
shall
die
for
your
false
word
a
light
matter
on
which
to
hang
lives
quoth
that
one
who
knows
how
many
have
owned
this
sword
but
i
got
it
from
kari
son
the
earl
smote
his
thigh
and
to
kari
my
father
gave
it
up
men
and
dight
yourselves
for
war
this
day
we
sail
for
the
orkneys
so
earl
thorfinn
sailed
north
and
with
him
went
grani
rolf
and
frodi
those
bearers
of
the
tidings
and
before
ever
the
scots
were
ready
for
them
the
orkneyingers
closed
in
upon
hawksness
and
attacked
the
scottish
fleet
some
of
the
scots
were
away
and
some
were
ashore
those
who
might
fight
lashed
their
ships
in
a
line
as
in
a
line
the
earl
ships
bore
down
on
them
that
fight
lasted
not
long
and
all
the
scottish
ships
were
taken
the
scots
who
were
on
shore
were
hunted
down
and
as
their
ships
came
in
from
the
other
isles
they
were
taken
one
by
one
kiartan
ship
was
still
on
the
beach
and
he
was
found
in
the
church
chapter
xxiv
now
rolf
and
grani
quarrel
now
says
the
tale
that
rolf
goes
before
the
earl
and
tells
of
kiartan
treachery
thou
shalt
have
thine
own
way
with
him
quoth
thorfinn
shall
he
die
by
the
hands
of
my
men
or
what
atonement
wilt
thou
take
i
ask
not
his
death
said
rolf
give
me
his
ship
to
return
to
iceland
in
and
his
goods
to
repay
my
mother
for
all
her
sufferings
but
of
those
sufferings
nor
of
all
that
kiartan
had
done
the
earl
did
not
ask
until
later
thou
art
easy
said
he
upon
him
who
sought
thy
life
but
all
shall
be
as
thou
sayest
then
grani
spoke
apart
with
the
earl
and
after
that
thorfinn
gave
orders
to
his
men
where
the
sward
lay
greenest
for
no
snow
lay
on
southern
slopes
all
that
winter
they
cut
a
strip
of
turf
its
middle
they
raised
and
propped
aloft
on
spears
but
its
ends
were
still
in
the
ground
then
the
earl
called
rolf
to
come
and
bade
all
men
stand
there
and
hear
what
grani
had
to
say
before
all
grani
told
that
he
had
wrongfully
enthralled
rolf
and
led
by
kiartan
had
treated
him
unfairly
his
sorrow
he
confessed
and
he
asked
for
pardon
answered
rolf
for
this
i
grant
pardon
readily
enough
meseems
thou
sayest
that
coldly
man
said
the
earl
now
here
stands
grani
to
swear
with
thee
under
this
turf
what
sayest
thou
to
that
now
was
a
sacred
ceremony
and
those
who
swore
it
must
uphold
each
other
until
death
if
once
the
oath
was
taken
under
such
a
strip
of
turf
by
letting
blood
from
the
arms
mingle
in
the
ground
and
no
greater
honor
might
one
man
do
another
than
to
offer
but
again
rolf
spoke
coolly
and
said
mayhap
i
am
willing
to
do
that
come
then
said
thorfinn
lay
aside
thy
sword
and
step
under
the
turf
with
grani
once
i
swore
replied
rolf
never
to
leave
weapon
from
my
reach
and
another
oath
i
call
to
mind
which
later
i
may
tell
thee
here
now
since
is
asked
here
i
name
myself
rolf
son
of
hiarandi
of
cragness
above
broadfirth
in
iceland
and
remembering
what
grani
said
when
we
were
like
to
be
burnt
together
i
ask
his
true
name
and
his
father
name
and
his
birthplace
grani
hight
i
answered
that
one
years
long
have
i
been
fostered
here
and
i
remember
little
of
my
childhood
but
einar
is
my
father
fellstead
was
our
home
and
the
place
is
that
same
broadfirth
out
in
iceland
so
much
i
know
and
no
more
then
those
who
stood
by
saw
rolf
draw
his
and
spring
at
grani
at
his
forehead
rolf
laid
the
sword
the
flat
to
the
skin
thus
cried
he
i
laid
this
sword
to
thy
father
head
but
thus
and
he
turned
the
sword
i
lay
it
to
thine
edge
to
thy
flesh
and
because
i
promised
to
do
it
thus
i
draw
thy
blood
he
drew
the
sword
lightly
across
grani
forehead
and
the
blood
started
out
in
little
drops
then
rolf
dropped
his
arm
sheathed
his
sword
and
stood
quiet
but
grani
white
with
rage
snatched
a
spear
from
one
of
the
earl
men
and
would
have
slain
rolf
had
not
the
earl
himself
come
between
now
quoth
thorfinn
grimly
here
is
an
odd
end
to
the
cause
of
this
shall
i
hear
from
first
unto
last
then
rolf
told
the
story
of
his
father
wrongs
and
his
own
and
frodi
said
it
all
was
true
grani
though
he
learned
what
his
father
had
done
stood
still
and
said
no
word
except
that
he
cried
at
the
end
great
insult
hath
rolf
offered
me
in
drawing
my
blood
and
for
that
shall
he
pay
with
his
meseems
answered
the
earl
that
the
weight
of
is
still
on
thy
side
and
it
is
well
for
thee
that
rolf
took
not
payment
in
full
and
this
i
advise
that
here
ye
two
make
up
the
feud
and
all
money
atonements
i
will
make
to
rolf
if
so
be
i
see
ye
accorded
i
will
lay
down
the
feud
on
these
terms
said
rolf
if
grani
will
get
me
my
homestead
again
but
deep
anger
burned
in
grani
that
his
offer
of
had
been
so
answered
by
the
shedding
of
his
blood
he
strode
to
the
spears
that
held
the
strip
of
turf
and
cast
them
down
my
feud
do
i
keep
he
cried
then
of
thee
said
the
earl
i
wash
my
hands
but
i
will
take
rolf
to
me
to
be
of
my
bodyguard
so
long
as
he
will
lord
earl
answered
rolf
i
thank
thee
for
the
honor
but
in
the
ship
which
thou
hast
given
me
i
must
return
to
iceland
there
to
clear
me
of
mine
outlawry
by
means
of
my
bow
and
then
that
meeting
of
men
broke
up
and
rolf
set
himself
to
fit
his
ship
for
the
outward
voyage
and
to
hire
sailors
he
had
wealth
enough
in
kiartan
goods
to
pay
for
all
his
father
had
lost
but
in
the
viking
bow
he
had
that
treasure
which
he
most
prized
for
it
should
win
him
his
honor
again
and
the
homestead
which
his
fathers
had
built
he
provisioned
his
ship
and
he
hired
men
and
a
shipmaster
and
soon
was
ready
for
the
voyage
outward
now
the
spring
was
early
without
storms
as
yet
but
grani
went
unhappily
about
knowing
that
danger
was
preparing
for
his
father
through
rolf
and
seeing
not
what
could
be
done
for
in
that
place
except
rolf
ship
lay
no
vessels
plying
either
north
or
south
and
none
to
go
to
iceland
so
there
was
no
way
for
grani
to
send
warning
to
einar
and
no
means
by
which
he
himself
might
go
to
iceland
to
stand
by
his
father
side
he
would
have
challenged
rolf
to
the
holm
but
and
all
duels
were
forbidden
by
the
earl
and
now
came
the
day
when
rolf
ship
was
ready
the
wind
was
fair
from
the
east
and
on
the
morrow
they
should
start
then
grani
went
and
sat
on
the
hillside
at
sunset
watching
the
men
at
a
little
distance
as
they
worked
about
the
ship
where
it
lay
upon
the
strand
but
rolf
and
frodi
had
gone
to
the
hall
and
were
feasting
there
with
the
earl
and
his
men
grani
thought
to
save
my
father
i
must
sail
on
that
ship
now
the
night
will
be
dark
and
the
men
will
sleep
at
the
huts
but
rolf
and
frodi
at
the
hall
naught
hinders
me
from
hiding
myself
on
the
ship
so
that
on
the
morrow
they
will
sail
with
me
that
pleased
him
well
but
before
dark
rolf
and
frodi
returned
from
the
hall
having
said
farewell
to
the
earl
the
ship
was
then
pushed
off
and
all
men
got
them
aboard
they
anchored
off
the
ready
to
sail
at
first
twilight
in
the
morning
then
when
grani
saw
his
plan
spoiled
in
great
uncertainty
of
mind
he
went
to
the
hall
and
sat
down
on
the
lowest
bench
quoth
the
earl
come
forward
grani
and
sit
here
near
the
dais
for
thou
didst
save
my
realm
as
much
as
did
those
other
two
who
have
just
said
farewell
i
know
that
well
lord
answered
grani
come
sit
here
by
my
side
said
the
earl
and
what
thou
askest
in
reward
for
thy
deed
that
i
will
give
thee
so
grani
sat
there
by
the
earl
side
until
it
was
dark
out
of
doors
and
he
knew
the
stars
were
out
but
no
moon
with
the
feast
thorfinn
waxed
joyous
for
good
tidings
had
come
that
day
and
he
began
to
press
grani
to
name
the
reward
he
would
have
for
crossing
the
pentland
firth
to
bring
him
news
so
grani
said
stretch
forth
thy
hand
now
earl
thorfinn
and
promise
to
grant
me
that
thing
which
i
ask
which
shall
take
from
no
man
his
right
or
his
own
so
the
earl
stretched
forth
his
hand
in
promise
and
said
ask
what
thou
wilt
then
all
the
orkneyingers
listened
while
grani
made
his
request
oh
earl
said
he
make
me
thine
outlaw
nay
cried
the
earl
what
request
is
this
dost
thou
mock
me
and
my
power
and
his
men
were
angry
and
some
drew
their
swords
but
grani
said
most
earnestly
i
mean
no
insult
but
much
lies
on
it
that
thou
shouldst
make
me
outlaw
wroth
indeed
were
the
orkneyingers
and
thronged
around
grani
to
slay
him
but
the
earl
signed
them
to
give
peace
and
sat
with
his
eye
on
the
youth
and
thought
then
at
last
he
smiled
in
his
beard
and
said
thou
art
a
clever
lad
and
bold
withal
here
i
grant
thy
desire
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
said
outlaw
do
i
make
thee
in
all
my
lands
not
to
be
fed
not
to
be
forwarded
not
to
be
helped
or
harbored
in
any
need
save
only
by
masters
of
ships
outward
bound
i
grant
thee
three
days
space
to
seek
shelter
and
here
i
give
notice
among
my
men
of
thy
full
outlawry
then
grani
thanked
the
earl
with
all
his
heart
and
went
from
the
hall
after
him
the
earl
men
scoffed
but
still
the
earl
smiled
in
his
beard
now
that
night
a
small
boat
rowed
to
the
side
of
rolf
ship
and
a
man
climbed
aboard
and
the
boatmen
rowed
the
boat
ashore
again
one
of
the
ship
men
told
rolf
who
sent
for
that
one
who
had
thus
come
aboard
he
stood
before
rolf
in
the
starlight
wrapped
in
a
cloak
rolf
asked
why
he
came
aboard
the
ship
in
that
manner
outlaw
am
i
said
that
one
and
by
law
thou
must
give
me
shelter
when
it
is
claimed
good
is
the
law
quoth
rolf
and
once
it
helped
me
ere
now
but
thy
voice
is
muffled
in
the
cloak
man
what
is
thy
name
is
my
name
answered
the
muffled
man
and
here
is
my
faring
money
rolf
laughed
fare
costs
nothing
said
he
and
would
not
take
the
silver
find
thyself
a
place
to
sleep
thou
art
welcome
here
so
that
one
found
himself
a
place
to
sleep
and
early
in
the
morning
the
ship
set
sail
now
it
is
said
that
when
the
ship
was
gone
the
earl
saw
kiartan
on
the
strand
bewailing
his
loss
thorfinn
ordered
that
kiartan
be
set
in
a
galley
as
rower
and
for
two
years
did
kiartan
labor
at
the
oar
then
he
escaped
and
fled
away
southward
but
he
became
thrall
to
a
chapman
and
was
a
thrall
to
the
end
of
his
days
so
now
he
is
out
of
the
story
but
that
outlaw
who
had
come
on
rolf
ship
lay
like
a
log
all
the
first
day
while
the
ship
sped
westward
and
only
at
night
did
he
rouse
to
take
food
four
days
he
did
thus
while
the
ship
ran
before
the
wind
until
the
faroe
islands
were
well
astern
then
on
a
morning
the
man
rose
and
walked
by
the
rail
and
looked
upon
the
sea
rolf
sent
for
him
to
come
and
speak
to
him
and
when
the
man
was
face
to
face
with
him
behold
it
was
grani
then
rolf
stood
and
looked
on
him
and
grani
stood
fast
and
looked
on
rolf
and
rolf
turned
away
and
walked
in
the
stern
but
grani
waited
in
the
same
place
at
last
rolf
came
back
to
him
and
said
only
one
thing
will
i
ask
of
thee
wast
thou
indeed
outlaw
of
the
earl
grani
stretched
out
his
hand
and
swore
to
the
truth
outlaw
was
i
and
the
earl
gave
me
but
three
days
to
quit
his
land
now
said
rolf
thou
art
on
my
ship
lawfully
and
naught
will
i
do
against
thee
we
will
leave
it
to
the
fates
which
of
us
shall
prosper
in
this
affair
so
grani
was
out
of
danger
of
his
life
now
that
east
wind
lasted
until
they
made
iceland
a
quick
voyage
and
they
sailed
along
the
south
of
the
land
and
rounded
the
western
cape
and
sailed
across
the
mouth
of
faxafirth
but
when
they
would
round
the
cape
into
broadfirth
the
wind
freshened
and
blew
them
off
the
land
a
day
sail
there
they
lay
when
the
wind
dropped
but
then
the
wind
came
from
the
west
and
blew
them
back
to
the
land
and
drove
them
ever
faster
till
there
was
a
high
gale
the
smallest
sail
they
could
set
split
from
the
mast
the
mast
itself
went
next
and
so
they
came
to
broadfirth
and
drove
up
it
night
drew
near
and
the
sailors
were
in
fear
of
their
lives
now
frodi
was
in
great
uneasiness
and
clung
to
his
place
and
looked
upon
the
waters
sometimes
he
made
as
he
would
speak
and
yet
he
said
nothing
rolf
and
grani
stayed
at
opposite
sides
of
the
ship
and
were
steadfast
in
all
danger
though
the
waves
washed
over
them
then
rolf
makes
his
way
to
grani
and
says
he
now
we
near
the
land
and
it
is
likely
that
we
shall
never
need
more
of
it
than
a
fathom
apiece
for
burial
therefore
here
i
offer
thee
peace
asking
no
atonement
from
thee
or
thy
father
save
only
my
farm
again
if
we
twain
get
ashore
grani
looks
upon
rolf
and
his
heart
nearly
melts
but
he
makes
himself
stubborn
and
drops
his
eyes
says
he
this
is
no
time
to
speak
of
that
rolf
clambers
back
to
his
place
the
moon
rises
behind
broken
clouds
and
he
sees
that
the
ship
drives
toward
cliffs
chapter
xxv
here
rolf
comes
to
cragness
now
turns
the
tale
to
speak
of
einar
how
he
took
possession
of
cragness
for
he
bought
the
share
of
the
men
of
the
quarter
and
how
snorri
the
priest
sent
for
asdis
that
she
should
come
to
him
for
the
sake
of
rolf
her
son
and
wait
the
three
years
of
his
exile
but
asdis
answered
the
messenger
of
snorri
i
go
to
our
little
farm
in
the
upland
where
i
can
look
upon
my
home
we
will
see
if
einar
sends
me
away
also
from
that
so
she
took
what
goods
she
might
and
drove
the
milch
ewe
before
her
and
went
to
the
turf
hut
in
the
upland
there
to
live
alone
now
einar
might
have
sent
her
thence
and
ondott
was
urgent
with
him
that
he
should
but
for
very
shame
einar
could
not
do
that
wrong
and
that
one
good
deed
of
his
stood
him
after
in
stead
as
the
saga
showeth
asdis
there
and
folk
brought
her
meal
but
snorri
sent
her
much
provision
and
dried
fish
to
keep
her
before
they
went
away
his
men
bought
wood
and
drew
it
for
her
and
cut
turf
for
burning
and
on
parting
they
gave
her
a
purse
of
one
and
six
silver
pennies
so
asdis
was
safe
from
all
want
but
no
happiness
could
come
to
her
so
long
as
each
day
she
looked
out
upon
the
hall
at
cragness
and
saw
strangers
there
einar
abode
in
great
pride
at
his
new
hall
and
kept
high
state
sending
to
fetch
whatever
travellers
came
that
way
and
when
harvest
came
he
had
a
great
feast
with
all
his
and
thralls
and
bonders
and
neighbors
bidden
notable
was
the
state
of
that
feast
but
ondott
when
all
were
merry
and
those
who
were
bidden
were
saying
that
einar
was
a
great
chief
on
account
of
his
ondott
let
call
for
bows
and
said
that
all
should
go
down
to
the
boundary
there
by
the
brook
he
held
a
mock
shoot
and
one
called
himself
rolf
and
made
as
if
he
would
shoot
to
the
oak
tree
but
shot
into
the
brook
and
wept
and
besought
others
to
shoot
for
him
the
looser
sort
hooted
and
thought
that
sport
and
shot
toward
the
oak
a
little
way
then
they
cried
that
hiarandi
was
lawfully
slain
and
rolf
was
outlaw
but
the
neighbors
of
the
better
sort
liked
that
not
and
changed
their
aspect
of
cheer
and
went
away
early
einar
said
to
ondott
why
didst
thou
such
foolery
that
we
may
know
said
ondott
who
are
of
thy
friends
and
who
thy
and
now
we
know
who
are
with
us
einar
let
himself
be
pleased
with
that
answer
so
the
harvest
passed
and
winter
went
by
and
spring
came
on
an
early
spring
without
storms
all
men
looked
to
their
plowing
and
sowing
and
einar
took
pleasure
in
the
at
cragness
which
were
so
fertile
but
he
disliked
the
lack
of
storms
for
since
he
came
to
cragness
no
wealth
had
come
to
him
from
wrecks
which
he
had
counted
on
as
part
of
his
riches
and
einar
had
no
custom
to
light
beacons
but
all
through
that
spring
he
and
ondott
looked
for
storms
men
said
that
storms
must
come
and
that
early
farers
from
overseas
might
be
caught
thereby
then
at
last
that
steady
wind
which
had
blown
from
the
east
first
dropped
and
then
shifted
and
blew
hard
from
the
west
a
great
gale
all
men
housed
themselves
and
a
murky
night
came
on
now
in
the
hall
at
cragness
the
old
crone
thurid
sat
by
the
fire
and
sang
to
herself
and
ondott
who
was
ever
prowling
to
hear
what
men
said
came
behind
her
and
listened
she
sang
bad
luck
and
good
are
both
abroad
if
beacon
light
be
set
this
night
comes
cragness
feud
to
quickest
good
hearest
thou
that
said
ondott
to
einar
he
sang
the
song
after
her
einar
asked
shall
we
light
the
beacon
for
he
was
easily
turned
in
his
purposes
but
ondott
smote
the
old
woman
and
cried
thou
singest
otherwise
than
when
thou
wert
with
hiarandi
ill
was
it
with
hiarandi
when
he
made
the
beacon
and
ill
would
it
be
with
us
he
asked
if
he
should
thrust
the
woman
from
the
house
but
einar
had
not
the
heart
for
that
the
old
woman
said
she
would
go
ere
the
light
came
again
and
was
silent
for
an
hour
now
it
is
said
that
had
einar
lighted
the
beacon
good
would
have
come
of
it
for
he
who
saves
life
is
minded
to
continue
in
right
doing
then
after
a
while
the
carline
sang
again
she
sang
thy
rocks
beneath
men
fight
with
death
go
see
what
woe
lies
there
below
einar
hurries
his
men
out
into
the
storm
and
himself
after
them
now
though
the
gale
continues
the
moon
is
bright
at
last
and
men
can
see
their
way
on
the
rocks
was
a
ship
and
her
timbers
were
breaking
away
from
her
and
driving
down
into
the
cove
to
the
lee
thither
einar
sent
most
of
his
men
to
save
what
they
could
from
the
sea
of
wood
chests
cloths
and
all
merchandise
but
he
watched
from
the
cliffs
with
ondott
and
hallvard
and
hallmund
to
see
if
men
escaped
from
the
fury
of
the
sea
he
saw
no
living
thing
at
all
until
at
the
last
one
man
came
climbing
the
cliff
toward
him
that
one
had
a
rope
around
his
waist
when
he
reached
a
shelf
of
rock
he
made
the
rope
fast
and
drew
on
it
and
pulled
up
a
long
case
and
a
bundle
he
cast
down
the
rope
again
and
drew
up
weapons
and
cast
again
and
drew
up
clothes
fishes
he
asked
einar
with
a
hook
on
that
rope
said
hallvard
other
men
must
be
below
helping
him
then
that
man
threw
down
the
rope
again
and
waited
a
while
and
held
the
rope
securely
it
seemed
as
if
a
weight
were
on
it
then
another
man
climbed
to
his
side
a
large
man
and
they
two
pulled
on
the
rope
together
drawing
it
up
there
came
into
sight
what
seemed
a
dead
body
but
now
where
climbing
was
easier
those
two
carried
the
body
to
the
top
of
the
cliffs
and
then
drew
up
the
case
and
the
arms
einar
and
his
men
went
thither
in
the
moonlight
but
ere
they
reached
the
place
the
men
took
the
body
between
them
and
carried
it
to
the
hall
and
into
the
hall
those
others
following
einar
went
to
the
door
to
see
what
the
men
would
do
they
laid
the
body
down
before
the
fire
and
einar
saw
it
was
a
handsome
youth
then
the
men
looked
about
them
as
they
stood
their
backs
were
to
einar
but
the
crone
thurid
saw
their
faces
and
she
hobbled
up
and
said
welcome
there
is
no
welcome
for
me
here
said
the
shorter
of
those
men
till
these
strange
hangings
are
gone
from
the
hall
and
it
has
been
purged
with
the
smoke
of
fire
from
their
contamination
now
einar
thought
he
should
know
that
voice
the
seafarer
said
to
the
crone
tell
einar
that
here
lies
his
son
who
comes
back
to
him
so
and
if
the
beacon
had
been
lighted
grani
had
come
in
better
wise
for
i
could
have
beached
the
ship
in
the
cove
but
yet
i
think
he
is
not
dead
and
so
farewell
to
cragness
for
a
space
so
those
two
turned
to
the
door
and
einar
ran
forward
and
cast
himself
on
the
body
of
his
son
not
looking
at
those
men
but
ondott
looked
on
them
and
they
were
rolf
and
frodi
spent
with
toil
in
the
water
and
on
the
rocks
and
when
ondott
bade
his
two
men
seize
them
they
were
too
weary
to
resist
so
they
were
bound
with
ropes
now
einar
saw
that
grani
was
not
dead
but
stunned
by
some
blow
he
called
the
women
and
bade
them
bring
cloths
and
heat
water
and
use
all
craft
to
bring
his
son
to
life
again
they
set
to
work
and
helga
grani
sister
came
and
looked
on
her
brother
face
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
a
little
boy
but
ondott
brought
before
einar
those
two
rolf
and
frodi
and
said
he
here
we
have
that
ravening
outlaw
and
his
cousin
now
what
is
thy
will
of
them
shall
they
die
here
under
the
knife
einar
said
nay
but
rather
set
them
free
ondott
cried
what
is
thy
thought
here
they
have
come
again
with
designs
on
thee
and
wilt
thou
let
them
go
and
they
will
dispossess
thy
son
of
his
heritage
wilt
thou
suffer
that
rolf
is
out
of
the
law
and
no
harm
will
come
of
the
slaying
and
ondott
pressed
einar
with
other
reasons
saying
that
most
of
their
men
were
at
the
cove
for
the
jetsam
and
hallmund
and
hallvard
would
never
tell
now
helga
heard
and
stood
before
her
father
saying
take
not
this
sin
on
thy
head
but
rather
let
both
the
men
go
yet
einar
heart
was
turned
to
evil
as
he
saw
how
but
two
of
his
men
were
there
and
those
of
the
trustiest
so
that
those
cousins
might
be
quickly
slain
and
buried
and
none
would
know
that
they
had
come
ashore
from
the
wreck
stand
aside
quoth
he
to
helga
and
let
these
foes
of
thy
heritage
die
as
they
should
but
helga
stepped
before
rolf
and
frodi
and
fronted
the
drawn
swords
of
ondott
and
his
men
unlawful
is
such
a
deed
she
cried
until
the
morning
light
comes
for
all
are
forbidden
even
of
outlaws
and
such
slayings
are
murder
and
when
she
saw
her
father
waver
again
she
told
him
how
even
the
earl
of
the
orkneys
and
he
was
father
of
earl
thorfinn
dared
not
slay
those
sons
of
njal
who
came
into
his
hands
and
so
take
the
sin
of
midnight
slaying
on
his
soul
but
he
set
them
aside
till
morning
should
come
aye
answered
ondott
and
in
the
morning
the
twain
were
fled
that
helga
knew
and
had
the
same
thought
in
her
mind
but
she
begged
her
father
not
to
take
such
shame
on
himself
rather
to
let
rolf
and
frodi
lie
in
bonds
till
morning
and
at
last
einar
promised
her
that
those
two
should
not
die
until
the
day
rolf
said
to
her
i
thank
thee
maiden
and
when
i
come
into
mine
own
again
i
shall
not
forget
this
for
it
has
been
prophesied
me
that
i
shall
yet
sleep
in
my
father
locked
bed
and
that
means
that
this
house
shall
be
mine
again
then
ondott
laughed
not
so
is
the
prophecy
to
be
read
he
cried
throw
them
into
the
locked
room
of
hiarandi
for
this
night
they
shall
sleep
soundly
elsewhere
so
in
that
little
room
where
rolf
fathers
had
slept
he
was
cast
with
frodi
and
there
they
lay
on
the
floor
and
had
no
comfort
of
that
place
because
of
their
bonds
now
grumbled
frodi
vikings
have
we
escaped
and
baresarks
and
the
scots
and
all
manner
of
dangers
and
the
sea
only
to
die
here
at
last
what
was
that
foolish
tale
of
thine
about
a
prophecy
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
free
me
of
my
bonds
answered
rolf
and
thou
shalt
learn
why
i
made
that
pretence
frodi
strove
against
his
bonds
but
they
were
too
strong
for
him
and
so
those
cousins
lay
there
for
a
while
but
outside
in
the
hall
the
women
worked
over
grani
until
at
last
he
moved
and
groaned
and
they
saw
that
he
would
live
so
for
joy
einar
knew
not
what
to
do
and
he
became
talkative
and
walked
about
and
so
stumbled
on
those
things
the
bundle
and
the
clothes
and
the
arms
and
the
case
which
had
been
brought
there
with
grani
when
he
examined
them
the
arms
pleased
him
right
well
for
in
the
case
he
found
the
marvellous
bow
of
the
viking
all
admired
the
bow
but
the
old
woman
thurid
muttered
to
herself
as
she
saw
them
handling
the
bow
and
at
last
drew
near
and
asked
to
see
it
the
bow
she
handled
and
the
arrows
she
looked
on
then
at
last
she
shuddered
and
let
the
bow
fall
and
sang
of
it
enemy
fierce
to
einar
fame
now
lieth
here
ere
thee
it
pierce
or
bringeth
grame
fire
it
should
sear
break
it
and
burn
thus
shalt
thou
turn
ill
from
thy
hall
ruin
from
all
this
i
discern
einar
looked
with
aversion
on
the
bow
where
it
lay
but
ondott
raised
it
and
held
it
aloft
now
asked
he
shall
such
a
beautiful
weapon
be
broken
for
a
crone
rhymes
all
cried
out
that
it
should
not
be
so
and
einar
took
the
bow
and
hung
it
on
his
high
seat
vowing
to
keep
it
then
he
said
to
thurid
she
should
be
gone
ere
morning
as
she
had
promised
the
old
woman
took
her
cloak
and
went
to
the
door
but
on
the
threshold
she
sang
here
got
i
one
gray
cloak
one
winter
meat
these
from
einar
here
got
i
one
gray
cloak
one
winter
meat
be
given
einar
ere
he
die
so
she
went
out
into
the
storm
now
the
moon
had
clouded
again
and
snow
fell
thickly
a
blinding
squall
so
the
old
woman
was
bewildered
and
very
cold
she
found
herself
a
place
by
a
rock
and
sat
there
singing
verses
until
at
last
she
fell
asleep
but
while
all
were
admiring
the
bow
in
the
hall
helga
came
to
the
door
of
the
locked
bed
and
took
away
the
brace
that
closed
it
and
cast
in
a
knife
and
shut
up
the
door
again
rolf
and
frodi
saw
and
they
conceived
this
plan
that
rolf
should
hold
the
knife
in
his
hands
and
frodi
should
rub
his
bonds
thereagainst
then
that
was
done
and
they
freed
themselves
yet
we
are
not
out
of
the
hall
said
frodi
and
with
helping
grani
the
place
will
be
awake
all
night
now
remember
the
prophecy
which
i
coined
answered
rolf
look
here
and
hold
thy
peace
and
he
showed
frodi
how
a
panel
in
the
wall
might
be
taken
out
so
that
the
way
was
free
come
then
frodi
said
but
rolf
would
not
why
stay
we
here
in
danger
asked
frodi
i
must
have
my
bow
replied
rolf
how
else
shall
i
win
my
heritage
again
but
when
they
tried
the
door
into
the
passage
which
led
to
the
hall
it
could
not
be
opened
without
great
noise
and
ever
they
heard
the
women
walking
about
as
they
tended
on
grani
remember
said
frodi
at
last
the
choice
which
grani
once
offered
thee
the
bow
or
thy
freedom
freedom
was
then
thy
choice
and
afterward
thou
didst
win
the
bow
show
now
the
like
wisdom
so
they
stole
away
in
the
first
light
of
the
morning
chapter
xxvi
of
grani
pride
in
the
early
morning
grani
slept
quietly
at
last
and
the
household
of
einar
had
peace
then
ondott
called
hallvard
and
hallmund
and
bade
them
come
with
him
to
the
locked
bed
they
went
but
though
the
door
was
still
secure
no
sign
of
those
two
cousins
was
to
be
found
nor
any
way
of
their
escape
and
outside
the
wind
had
so
drifted
the
snow
that
no
marks
of
feet
were
to
be
seen
ondott
and
his
men
searched
and
came
at
last
to
the
cove
where
men
watched
for
the
wreckage
he
asked
if
they
had
seen
those
two
thither
had
come
said
the
men
two
whom
they
knew
not
bearing
between
them
old
thurid
the
crone
now
at
that
hour
a
spar
from
the
ship
had
just
come
ashore
and
in
it
was
fixed
a
great
bill
its
blade
driven
so
deep
into
the
wood
that
with
all
their
might
three
men
could
not
draw
it
forth
they
were
about
to
hew
it
out
with
axes
then
the
taller
of
those
two
men
came
down
to
the
shingle
and
said
naught
to
einar
men
but
he
laid
hold
of
the
bill
and
with
one
tug
plucked
it
forth
from
the
spar
and
went
off
brandishing
it
and
muttering
to
himself
next
the
two
took
the
old
crone
again
and
went
away
ondott
and
his
men
hurried
on
their
track
and
when
they
had
passed
down
into
the
hollows
there
the
marks
of
feet
were
found
pointing
straight
to
the
little
hut
on
the
hillside
where
asdis
dwelt
a
league
away
so
ondott
took
more
men
and
went
thither
and
knocked
on
the
door
within
were
asdis
and
frodi
and
the
carline
thurid
but
no
sign
of
rolf
was
to
be
seen
frodi
sat
by
the
fire
and
handled
the
great
bill
and
thurid
lay
muffled
on
the
floor
as
she
was
wont
there
was
a
smell
of
cooking
while
very
pleased
did
asdis
seem
where
is
thy
son
asked
ondott
find
him
who
can
answered
asdis
they
searched
that
place
and
found
him
not
and
there
was
no
room
to
have
hidden
a
man
so
ondott
was
angry
and
he
said
to
frodi
give
us
that
bill
which
is
einar
since
it
came
ashore
on
his
beaches
frodi
answered
mildly
i
pray
thee
leave
it
me
but
as
he
spoke
he
thrust
the
butt
of
the
bill
down
upon
the
floor
where
the
earth
was
tramped
as
hard
as
any
stone
and
the
butt
made
a
great
dent
in
the
floor
ondott
thought
it
best
not
to
meddle
with
him
and
went
home
grani
lay
two
days
sick
and
weary
but
then
he
was
himself
again
neither
einar
nor
any
of
his
men
told
him
how
he
came
ashore
but
spoke
as
if
they
had
saved
him
einar
sent
men
everywhere
to
find
rolf
and
seize
him
yet
in
all
the
dales
no
man
had
seen
or
heard
of
him
so
when
grani
asked
if
others
got
ashore
from
the
wreck
einar
answered
that
outlaw
rolf
and
his
cousin
frodi
and
frodi
is
at
his
smithy
again
there
not
far
from
the
ferry
to
hvamm
where
is
rolf
grani
asked
no
man
knows
save
frodi
answered
einar
and
he
sayeth
not
then
spoke
grani
lying
on
his
bed
father
rolf
told
a
hard
tale
against
thee
in
the
orkneys
how
thou
slewest
his
father
foully
and
now
holdest
his
land
in
spite
of
right
now
tell
me
the
truth
of
all
this
ere
i
accept
aught
from
thee
then
einar
was
greatly
frightened
lest
grani
should
learn
the
truth
and
despise
him
he
made
as
if
he
were
offended
and
went
away
saying
and
canst
thou
think
that
of
me
but
when
he
was
out
of
grani
sight
he
sought
ondott
in
haste
and
asked
him
what
he
should
do
quoth
ondott
leave
all
to
me
i
will
settle
this
so
he
went
to
grani
and
einar
with
him
einar
said
i
have
brought
ondott
to
tell
the
truth
for
thou
wilt
better
believe
some
one
else
speaking
in
my
defence
then
ondott
told
a
long
tale
of
hiarandi
how
he
was
overbearing
and
insolent
and
preyed
on
einar
crops
and
cattle
moreover
hiarandi
was
a
dangerous
and
violent
man
going
always
armed
so
that
one
day
when
he
was
in
the
act
of
theft
and
einar
men
were
about
to
seize
him
but
einar
had
commanded
not
to
harm
him
hiarandi
had
so
attacked
those
men
that
to
save
their
own
lives
they
had
slain
him
and
rolf
had
no
right
to
the
land
being
outlawed
at
the
althing
now
tell
me
said
ondott
when
ye
twain
were
together
in
orkney
did
not
rolf
offer
peace
if
thou
wouldst
but
get
him
this
homestead
again
twice
he
did
that
answered
grani
see
now
cried
ondott
the
guile
that
is
in
him
then
grani
believed
all
that
ondott
had
said
and
thought
evil
of
rolf
and
craved
his
father
pardon
einar
forgave
him
and
when
grani
was
well
again
einar
showered
him
with
kindnesses
for
fearing
lest
his
son
should
learn
evil
of
him
he
did
all
that
he
might
to
earn
grani
love
sparing
neither
words
deeds
nor
money
einar
gave
the
finest
of
clothes
and
horses
and
attendants
so
that
not
with
ar
the
peacock
had
grani
had
such
state
wherefore
he
took
to
himself
such
pride
as
had
been
his
in
the
orkneys
he
went
abroad
among
the
iceland
folk
and
saw
that
they
were
a
simple
people
each
man
living
upon
his
own
farm
and
dressing
in
plain
clothes
loving
direct
speech
and
homely
ways
so
grani
missed
the
best
that
was
in
the
people
but
thought
them
he
dressed
always
in
colored
clothes
and
had
attendants
with
him
and
expected
such
respect
from
men
as
he
had
received
when
he
was
fosterling
now
at
cragness
honor
was
always
showed
him
but
the
neighbors
of
einar
were
to
grani
blunt
of
speech
sometimes
biting
and
he
loved
them
little
thinking
them
rough
two
more
matters
troubled
grani
for
he
had
little
happiness
in
his
sister
who
seemed
almost
always
downcast
and
as
if
disappointed
in
him
and
ever
deep
within
his
heart
lay
that
love
of
his
for
rolf
nor
could
he
forget
their
comradeship
nor
the
dangers
they
had
together
borne
he
took
no
great
satisfaction
therefore
to
be
a
princeling
on
his
land
but
away
from
it
to
be
treated
roughly
and
always
to
have
that
desire
to
see
his
friend
again
yet
he
never
made
to
himself
any
confession
of
fault
believing
rolf
in
the
wrong
both
toward
himself
and
toward
einar
so
he
hardened
his
heart
and
increased
his
outward
pride
even
while
he
was
ever
on
the
watch
for
news
of
rolf
now
one
day
he
rode
abroad
with
ondott
and
his
men
and
they
came
to
the
hut
on
the
hillside
where
dwelt
asdis
the
mother
of
rolf
summer
was
come
asdis
sat
out
of
doors
by
the
spring
combing
flax
with
thurid
cowled
by
her
side
no
welcome
gave
asdis
to
them
but
asked
their
errand
to
learn
whether
thou
hast
news
of
thy
son
ondott
said
now
that
was
not
true
for
they
came
thither
by
accident
having
hunted
higher
up
in
the
hills
but
grani
said
nothing
wishing
to
learn
of
rolf
ever
thou
liest
in
wait
for
blood
answered
asdis
but
ask
not
me
for
news
of
rolf
rather
of
those
who
have
been
near
the
isle
of
drangey
shouldst
thou
inquire
if
none
resembling
my
son
have
been
seen
on
the
and
whether
he
and
grettir
the
strong
and
illugi
his
brother
are
likely
to
be
won
thence
against
their
wills
now
cried
ondott
i
thank
thee
for
this
news
and
one
in
that
thorstein
angle
he
is
my
cousin
he
will
let
me
know
if
ever
thy
son
comes
thence
if
thorstein
angle
is
thy
cousin
said
asdis
that
shows
the
saying
true
that
all
rogues
are
akin
but
if
thou
nearest
aught
from
that
region
i
pray
thee
let
me
know
if
my
son
is
well
now
all
the
time
thurid
sat
there
and
combed
no
flax
nor
said
a
word
and
yet
said
ondott
i
hear
that
the
woman
works
well
at
times
speak
not
so
loud
in
her
presence
said
asdis
for
methinks
now
she
is
tranced
mayhap
when
she
comes
to
she
will
prophesy
and
tell
me
of
my
son
nay
said
ondott
the
woman
is
clean
daft
so
they
say
ever
since
she
left
our
house
to
wander
in
the
cold
now
who
has
split
the
wood
that
lieth
here
and
piled
it
against
the
house
for
thou
hast
not
done
it
i
will
tell
thee
said
asdis
and
lowered
her
voice
on
that
night
the
frost
got
in
her
brain
mayhap
for
she
was
ever
strange
but
now
she
is
little
short
of
marvellous
sometimes
she
works
with
a
strength
and
at
such
times
she
splits
wood
or
carries
water
or
spades
here
in
my
little
field
i
have
done
no
heavy
work
since
she
came
but
she
is
very
silent
nor
hath
any
save
me
and
frodi
seen
her
face
or
heard
her
voice
such
is
her
mood
now
let
us
ride
hence
said
ondott
to
grani
asdis
i
wish
thee
joy
of
thy
better
live
with
her
than
alone
quoth
asdis
so
those
men
rode
away
and
they
spread
abroad
the
news
that
rolf
was
gone
from
broadfirth
dales
for
he
was
in
drangey
with
grettir
the
strong
and
none
could
draw
them
from
that
isle
steep
were
its
rocks
and
high
to
be
scaled
only
by
ladders
and
three
might
hold
the
place
against
three
hundred
word
was
also
spread
about
of
thurid
the
crone
how
she
had
fits
of
man
strength
and
did
work
for
asdis
men
saw
her
going
with
great
strides
or
working
in
the
field
at
a
distance
she
seemed
taller
than
before
and
bigger
across
the
shoulders
but
when
one
came
near
she
shrank
within
herself
moreover
no
one
heard
her
voice
now
save
when
she
mumbled
hoarsely
now
on
another
day
grani
rode
to
the
settlement
at
hvammferry
and
on
his
way
homeward
came
by
the
smithy
of
frodi
ondott
was
in
his
company
with
hallvard
and
hallmund
they
proposed
that
they
should
have
sport
with
the
smith
and
take
from
him
his
bill
sport
mayest
thou
try
said
grani
but
beware
lest
it
turn
out
against
thee
he
is
soft
as
custard
quoth
ondott
otherwise
was
he
in
the
orkneys
replied
grani
but
for
all
that
ondott
rode
to
the
and
called
frodi
to
come
out
he
came
and
leaned
on
the
handle
of
his
hammer
which
was
so
big
that
no
man
had
wielded
it
since
he
went
away
he
asked
what
they
would
of
him
said
ondott
here
is
grani
earl
fosterling
to
require
something
of
thee
frodi
said
to
him
was
then
grani
fostered
by
the
earl
and
he
fixed
grani
with
his
eye
but
that
one
blushed
and
said
naught
for
he
knew
that
his
father
had
boasted
of
his
fostering
with
the
earl
and
never
had
grani
said
nay
thereto
asked
ondott
was
he
not
frodi
said
he
came
last
from
the
earl
court
so
frodi
who
might
have
spoken
honor
away
from
grani
made
him
feel
more
shame
than
if
the
truth
had
been
said
now
said
ondott
bring
forth
the
bill
which
is
einar
and
deliver
it
to
us
asks
grani
that
frodi
replied
grani
said
i
ask
nothing
and
he
spurred
his
horse
a
few
rods
away
frodi
went
within
the
smithy
and
brought
out
the
bill
but
set
also
a
helm
on
his
head
said
he
here
is
the
bill
for
whomsoever
wishes
it
but
grani
said
over
his
shoulder
leave
the
bill
with
him
no
use
is
it
to
us
for
we
have
none
that
can
wield
it
then
ondott
was
wroth
that
grani
did
not
support
him
in
that
claim
and
he
said
now
frodi
i
call
to
mind
that
ere
thou
wentest
away
thou
didst
assault
me
here
in
this
smithy
outlaw
will
i
make
thee
therefor
frodi
made
a
sudden
step
and
behold
there
he
was
within
reach
of
ondott
holding
the
bill
in
such
wise
that
he
might
have
thrust
ondott
through
albeit
frodi
neither
raised
the
weapon
aloft
nor
brandished
it
he
said
now
for
the
love
which
has
always
been
between
us
be
so
kind
as
to
speak
me
free
of
guilt
in
that
matter
when
i
drew
weapon
on
thee
in
a
fright
ondott
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
spoke
frodi
free
of
that
guilt
so
frodi
suddenly
shifted
the
bill
in
his
hand
and
the
point
touched
the
ground
none
who
had
not
looked
close
would
have
supposed
any
threat
had
been
made
said
frodi
see
how
kind
ondott
is
to
me
in
asking
no
atonement
being
in
no
danger
from
me
witness
ye
all
that
i
am
clear
in
that
matter
grani
smiled
and
rode
away
and
the
men
next
ondott
followed
mightily
vexed
that
that
simple
one
had
so
bested
him
now
the
time
came
for
men
to
ride
to
the
althing
and
with
all
state
einar
rode
thither
with
his
son
then
for
the
first
time
grani
saw
the
power
of
that
land
which
he
had
despised
for
chiefs
met
there
who
were
greater
in
riches
than
orkney
thanes
having
great
followings
all
richly
dressed
but
all
were
obedient
to
the
law
and
a
wonderful
thing
that
was
to
see
men
of
such
power
yielding
in
lawsuits
to
lesser
men
and
bringing
no
cases
to
weapons
and
grani
learned
that
his
father
was
of
no
consequence
at
all
in
that
place
for
men
passed
him
by
and
gave
him
no
honor
yet
for
all
that
grani
pride
grew
and
he
said
that
men
should
some
day
recognize
him
there
and
he
rode
home
moodily
behind
his
company
now
as
men
rode
again
toward
the
west
grani
saw
one
man
whom
he
had
oft
remarked
at
the
thing
kolbein
the
son
of
destined
to
be
a
leader
among
men
grani
wished
friendship
with
him
greatly
and
kolbein
rode
to
grani
and
said
keeps
thy
father
his
harvest
feast
this
year
as
before
asking
company
thereto
yea
answered
grani
wilt
thou
come
gladly
will
i
come
answered
kolbein
and
will
bring
friends
with
me
if
so
be
we
shall
be
welcome
welcome
will
ye
all
be
said
grani
and
rode
home
cheered
now
when
they
were
come
to
cragness
helga
met
them
at
the
door
and
welcomed
them
in
they
asked
if
aught
had
happened
in
their
absence
said
she
nothing
save
that
the
carline
thurid
was
here
yestreen
and
i
am
the
first
that
has
heard
her
speak
since
she
left
here
in
the
spring
they
asked
what
were
her
words
i
was
here
alone
in
the
hall
helga
said
for
all
the
women
were
making
cheeses
in
the
and
thurid
came
in
and
shuffled
about
the
place
looking
at
things
i
bade
her
be
seated
for
i
would
bring
her
milk
and
but
when
i
brought
them
she
had
the
great
bow
in
her
hands
and
looked
at
it
but
would
not
eat
so
i
set
the
food
away
again
and
when
i
returned
she
had
the
bow
and
the
quiver
and
was
near
the
door
as
if
to
take
them
away
she
said
nothing
when
i
asked
what
she
did
with
those
so
i
stood
in
her
way
thinking
i
was
stronger
than
she
with
one
hand
she
set
me
aside
and
i
might
resist
her
no
more
than
if
she
were
a
man
so
she
bore
the
bow
and
arrows
from
the
house
and
i
thought
they
were
gone
but
on
a
sudden
she
was
back
again
and
laid
them
on
the
bench
and
she
said
in
a
deep
voice
not
like
her
own
with
women
do
i
strive
then
with
great
steps
she
went
out
of
the
hall
and
came
not
again
those
three
einar
and
ondott
and
grani
looked
at
each
other
with
alarm
for
if
that
bow
left
in
the
ward
of
women
had
thus
been
taken
men
could
know
neither
the
day
nor
the
hour
when
rolf
might
come
and
make
the
shot
at
the
before
witnesses
when
all
would
be
over
with
the
house
of
einar
and
ere
aught
was
said
einar
took
the
bow
and
bestowed
it
under
a
settle
where
it
was
well
hid
then
they
praised
their
fortune
that
they
had
it
still
so
all
sat
down
to
meat
and
ate
gladly
for
they
had
journeyed
days
long
from
the
then
night
fell
and
they
spoke
of
many
things
at
last
einar
asked
his
son
what
said
to
thee
kolbein
son
of
flosi
there
ere
our
roads
parted
he
asked
me
answered
grani
whether
we
hold
the
harvest
feast
as
last
year
and
if
he
and
his
company
would
be
welcome
says
einar
rubbing
his
hands
now
the
great
folk
come
to
alliance
with
us
and
when
a
few
chiefs
have
visited
here
then
thou
mayest
count
thyself
their
equal
in
all
things
even
as
thou
art
in
wealth
of
course
thou
badst
him
come
that
i
did
says
grani
so
ondott
praised
him
men
have
marked
thee
there
at
the
thing
and
seek
to
ally
themselves
with
thee
but
helga
who
had
listened
burst
into
tears
what
is
it
asks
grani
that
makes
thee
weep
helga
dashed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
stood
before
those
two
her
father
and
her
brother
much
had
i
hoped
says
she
that
wicked
doings
would
cease
in
this
house
for
to
mock
the
dead
and
the
unfortunate
is
wicked
and
if
ye
hold
the
feast
as
last
year
and
shoot
at
the
boundary
as
then
laughing
at
hiarandi
fortune
then
ye
tempt
your
own
fate
for
such
deeds
go
not
unpunished
long
now
asked
grani
of
his
father
hast
thou
so
mocked
that
luckless
man
fate
einar
said
he
had
and
it
was
seen
that
grani
thought
that
act
far
too
strong
yet
see
said
ondott
what
friends
that
brings
you
now
for
from
the
house
of
flosi
comes
this
offer
of
friendship
now
as
they
spoke
someone
knocked
at
the
door
and
there
was
a
housecarle
of
snorri
the
priest
my
master
said
he
passes
on
his
way
home
from
the
althing
and
sends

and
will

helga
then
einar
turned
to
grani
the
mightiest

chapter
xxvii
odd
doings
at
cragness
now
time
wears
toward
harvest
and
in
the
dales
all
is
quiet
and
busy
so
that
men
when
they
meet
have
little
gossip
save
only
of
the
doings
of
thurid
the
crone
for
she
travelled
far
and
wide
in
the
night
and
men
saw
her
so
distant
from
home
that
it
was
said
she
rode
the
wind
she
was
seen
near
the
farm
of
far
to
the
east
and
near
the
hall
of
snorri
the
priest
to
the
west
ever
when
seen
in
the
dark
she
strode
furiously
by
day
she
was
always
bent
and
slow
old
men
spoke
of
her
youth
when
she
was
brisk
and
handy
it
seemed
as
if
her
youth
came
again
in
these
fits
foretelling
her
death
moreover
by
asdis
work
nothing
now
lagged
and
the
field
was
plowed
sowed
and
harrowed
so
that
never
had
such
a
crop
stood
on
those
poor
acres
and
that
by
the
work
of
two
women
some
questioned
whether
indeed
rolf
were
not
about
but
there
was
no
place
in
the
hut
for
hiding
a
man
howbeit
busybodies
pried
about
there
much
now
all
that
they
found
was
what
looked
to
be
a
grave
not
far
from
the
so
then
the
tale
ran
that
rolf
was
dead
and
there
buried
but
when
questioned
asdis
would
only
laugh
and
say
whether
it
is
a
grave
or
the
place
where
stood
a
little
tree
that
i
uprooted
for
fuel
that
ye
may
guess
but
she
was
always
so
blithe
that
it
was
sure
her
son
still
lived
now
on
a
day
word
came
to
ondott
from
thorstein
angle
his
cousin
that
three
men
for
sure
dwelt
on
the
island
of
drangey
they
were
grettir
the
strong
and
illugi
his
brother
and
some
man
unknown
but
whether
more
men
dwelt
there
no
one
could
say
for
so
high
were
the
cliffs
that
nothing
could
be
seen
from
the
mainland
and
another
three
might
for
a
twelvemonth
lie
there
hidden
many
believed
that
others
were
there
so
ondott
was
satisfied
that
rolf
lay
in
hiding
there
afar
off
and
would
not
trouble
the
for
a
long
time
to
come
now
came
harvest
rich
and
full
a
bountiful
year
men
worked
hard
in
the
fields
the
women
too
and
at
night
sleep
was
sound
there
came
a
morning
when
it
was
found
that
cragness
had
been
entered
at
night
and
the
whole
hall
ransacked
its
passages
lofts
and
goods
were
taken
from
their
places
and
laid
aside
chests
had
been
moved
opened
and
emptied
and
there
was
scarce
a
corner
of
the
place
but
had
been
searched
yet
gold
and
silver
whether
in
money
rings
or
vessels
were
left
behind
nor
were
they
even
gathered
together
for
booty
so
it
was
seen
that
no
common
thief
had
been
there
and
men
wondered
wherefore
that
had
been
done
but
grani
sent
all
his
men
to
work
in
the
field
and
the
women
to
righting
the
house
then
he
took
the
bow
from
under
the
settle
where
it
was
hid
with
its
arrows
and
he
thrust
it
within
the
dais
whereon
were
the
seats
of
honor
now
a
night
passed
again
and
no
one
heard
the
dogs
bark
but
in
the
morning
it
was
seen
that
the
thief
had
come
again
and
all
the
settles
were
out
of
their
places
as
if
one
had
searched
beneath
them
no
other
places
were
searched
and
nothing
had
been
taken
all
thought
it
strange
that
the
dogs
had
not
barked
then
another
day
passed
and
men
came
home
to
sleep
as
tired
as
before
so
then
grani
took
the
bow
and
hid
it
up
under
the
thatch
when
all
had
gone
to
their
beds
in
the
morning
nothing
had
happened
save
that
the
seats
on
the
dais
had
all
been
moved
and
the
dais
was
found
set
up
against
the
wall
now
the
dais
was
heavy
and
that
work
had
been
done
with
much
strength
while
men
were
marvelling
the
neatherd
came
in
and
said
he
had
been
awake
early
in
the
byre
with
a
sick
calf
before
sunrise
he
looked
out
of
the
window
the
light
was
not
strong
but
he
could
see
a
little
way
there
he
saw
the
crone
thurid
standing
near
the
house
but
when
he
ran
out
to
speak
with
her
she
had
moved
toward
the
cliffs
whether
she
saw
or
heard
him
he
could
not
say
but
suddenly
she
began
to
go
with
long
strides
a
little
mist
hung
above
the
crags
into
that
mist
she
went
seeming
to
walk
upon
the
air
and
while
he
stood
astonished
the
mist
wreathed
around
her
and
she
was
lost
from
sight
he
said
to
himself
that
was
the
end
of
the
old
woman
but
in
an
hour
looking
toward
the
upland
he
saw
her
walking
to
the
hut
of
asdis
and
that
matter
he
could
not
explain
grani
sent
all
men
about
their
work
again
he
took
the
bow
from
the
hall
with
its
quiver
and
carried
them
to
the
great
and
hid
them
beneath
sacks
of
grain
then
a
night
passed
and
nothing
happened
but
on
the
second
night
noises
were
heard
men
took
lights
and
searched
in
the
hall
finding
nothing
yet
in
the
morning
it
was
seen
that
someone
had
been
at
work
under
the
thatch
of
the
hall
by
every
rafter
and
it
was
a
bold
deed
to
do
that
ransacking
in
the
dark
for
a
fall
might
mean
death
no
one
had
seen
thurid
nor
any
living
soul
yet
a
tatter
of
cloth
was
found
like
as
it
had
been
torn
from
the
old
woman
gray
cloak
now
grani
takes
the
bow
from
the
and
thinks
much
by
himself
and
at
last
hides
it
in
a
haystack
an
old
one
and
there
the
bow
lies
deep
within
that
night
he
sets
men
to
watch
in
the
and
fetches
dogs
from
a
tenants
farm
and
hopes
now
to
catch
the
thief
but
one
comes
by
night
and
enters
the
by
the
thatch
and
takes
the
watchmen
asleep
binding
them
with
their
heads
in
the
bags
that
lay
there
and
all
the
was
searched
and
everything
moved
and
the
thief
away
before
day
but
nothing
taken
those
dogs
which
had
been
brought
and
tied
by
the
door
had
had
their
leashes
cut
and
were
off
to
their
master
but
the
dogs
of
the
place
had
given
no
sign
those
were
the
best
in
the
dales
and
had
belonged
to
hiarandi
no
footprints
were
found
about
the
place
and
the
watchmen
said
but
one
person
had
been
there
marvellous
silent
and
strong
grani
took
much
thought
where
now
to
hide
the
bow
and
bespoke
the
matter
with
einar
and
ondott
but
they
found
no
better
place
than
where
it
lay
so
there
they
let
it
bide
and
ondott
went
with
men
to
the
hut
of
asdis
and
called
for
the
woman
thurid
asdis
said
she
slept
within
and
would
not
come
out
so
ondott
spoke
to
her
from
the
doorway
as
the
crone
lay
within
by
the
hearth
a
bundle
of
rags
she
was
is
it
thou
that
comest
to
our
house
asked
ondott
making
this
mischief
there
she
speaks
to
no
one
save
me
said
asdis
and
never
when
questioned
tell
her
said
ondott
that
if
more
searchings
go
on
at
cragness
we
will
hale
the
old
woman
before
the
bishop
and
exorcise
her
for
sorcery
since
there
must
be
witchcraft
in
these
doings
so
take
heed
to
her
goodwife
and
thyself
as
well
thou
art
brave
said
asdis
to
threaten
two
women
so
ondott
rides
away
again
and
that
was
the
end
of
those
happenings
at
cragness
some
said
the
thief
could
not
find
what
he
sought
but
some
that
thurid
was
the
thief
and
ondott
had
frighted
her
time
now
fell
for
the
harvest
feast
and
all
preparations
were
made
for
receiving
guests
great
store
of
good
things
was
made
ready
and
food
and
fodder
for
man
and
beast
comes
at
last
helga
to
grani
and
begs
him
not
to
hold
the
feast
at
all
for
her
mind
misgives
her
because
of
it
he
says
that
the
guests
must
be
on
the
way
and
bids
her
work
at
the
cooking
and
forget
those
thoughts
she
goes
away
sorrowful
and
says
no
more
of
this
to
anyone
then
on
the
morrow
the
guests
are
seen
riding
both
snorri
the
priest
that
old
man
and
kolbein
flosi
son
each
with
a
large
company
chapter
xxviii
of
that
harvest
feast
now
einar
shepherd
came
in
haste
and
said
the
folk
of
the
were
coming
from
all
directions
and
a
great
number
would
be
at
the
feast
yet
many
said
he
bear
weapons
and
i
know
not
what
that
may
mean
so
men
looked
and
it
was
seen
that
the
farmers
and
bonders
were
coming
over
the
hills
in
small
companies
or
large
those
of
keen
eyes
said
that
most
carried
then
ondott
looked
at
those
two
large
parties
that
came
riding
one
from
the
east
and
one
from
the
north
and
thought
them
very
numerous
meseems
said
he
that
snorri
and
kolbein
bring
more
men
than
they
need
fearest
thou
ondott
asked
grani
this
only
do
i
fear
that
we
have
not
enough
food
ready
only
on
going
to
church
do
men
lay
aside
weapons
not
strange
were
it
if
snorri
and
kolbein
coming
from
so
far
bade
their
men
bring
longswords
spears
and
shields
yet
they
wear
no
mail
and
bear
only
the
one
weapon
clear
token
of
peace
come
bid
the
women
prepare
more
food
and
do
thou
father
let
bring
out
more
casks
of
ale
to
welcome
so
many
guests
thus
he
shamed
the
household
and
all
went
quickly
to
make
ready
more
food
and
drink
then
the
neighbors
began
to
arrive
some
on
horses
and
some
on
foot
all
in
holiday
guise
save
that
each
man
bore
a
single
weapon
grani
and
einar
welcomed
each
as
he
came
and
then
the
companies
of
those
chiefs
rode
in
and
there
was
great
bustle
to
receive
them
the
horses
were
taken
to
the
stalls
and
the
men
led
within
the
hall
gracious
to
einar
was
snorri
the
priest
and
he
said
fine
words
of
grani
growth
and
fair
looks
and
the
goodly
house
kolbein
was
more
silent
but
looked
about
him
much
and
all
those
at
cragness
were
pleased
with
their
great
guests
save
only
helga
who
worked
among
her
women
and
looked
sad
when
grani
saw
that
he
sought
to
cheer
her
bidding
her
mark
the
pleasure
of
the
visitors
methinks
said
helga
the
old
man
smiles
too
much
and
the
young
man
too
little
little
good
does
my
heart
prophesy
of
this
visit
grani
was
impatient
with
her
and
left
her
alone
now
guests
continued
to
come
in
a
great
number
so
many
that
they
were
not
all
able
to
come
into
the
hall
those
of
lesser
condition
sat
outside
on
the
mead
and
the
time
drew
near
noon
before
all
were
there
so
at
last
einar
asked
if
more
were
to
be
seen
coming
and
his
men
looked
abroad
from
the
hilltop
and
saw
no
one
travelling
they
saw
only
three
living
souls
two
were
asdis
and
thurid
where
they
worked
in
the
garden
by
the
little
hut
across
the
valley
and
one
was
a
great
man
who
lolled
on
a
nearer
hillside
and
seemed
to
look
out
upon
broadfirth
something
glittered
in
the
grass
by
his
side
but
no
one
knew
who
or
what
it
might
be
so
einar
let
call
all
forth
from
the
house
and
he
stood
on
a
stool
and
spake
to
them
first
he
bade
them
welcome
and
then
he
spoke
of
that
custom
which
the
last
year
had
seen
begun
shooting
at
the
boundary
in
memory
of
his
ownership
of
those
lands
and
that
hall
some
he
knew
had
been
displeased
thereat
yet
he
trusted
that
now
they
saw
his
reasons
for
it
for
in
the
sight
of
all
quoth
einar
i
will
have
it
known
that
my
title
is
just
and
will
prove
that
all
which
made
me
master
here
was
done
within
the
law
very
reasonable
was
that
speech
snorri
smiled
and
nodded
graciously
and
einar
folk
applauded
but
the
others
not
so
much
now
einar
said
men
claim
that
grettir
the
strong
can
make
this
shot
and
put
me
from
my
lands
but
since
the
law
allows
no
outlaw
to
meddle
in
suits
he
may
not
make
the
trial
yet
i
invite
all
other
men
hither
to
prove
me
guiltless
therefore
come
ye
with
me
to
the
brookside
and
let
all
try
who
will
few
do
i
think
will
assay
but
all
are
free
to
it
in
token
of
peace
leave
your
arms
here
and
let
us
go
down
to
the
boundary
when
they
heard
that
einar
men
laid
aside
what
weapons
they
had
but
those
strangers
made
as
if
they
heard
not
yet
all
together
began
walking
to
the
meadow
by
the
brook
and
einar
when
he
saw
they
took
no
heed
to
his
request
was
of
two
minds
whether
to
say
no
more
or
to
ask
them
again
to
lay
aside
their
swords
but
that
seemed
a
slight
to
his
guests
so
he
spoke
not
of
it
again
and
all
together
they
went
down
the
hillside
leaving
at
the
hall
only
the
women
still
cooking
for
so
many
people
einar
had
given
orders
that
no
ribald
mocking
should
be
made
in
shooting
such
as
the
baser
of
his
men
had
done
before
for
all
should
be
decorous
so
bows
were
brought
the
best
there
were
his
bowmen
made
ready
and
one
by
one
they
shot
before
the
guests
snorri
sat
on
a
dais
which
einar
had
let
make
and
kolbein
and
einar
sat
on
either
hand
but
grani
stood
he
was
very
anxious
to
see
how
near
the
arrows
would
fall
to
the
oak
but
the
nearest
fell
roods
away
and
he
said
to
himself
now
my
father
is
completely
justified
for
not
even
grettir
could
shoot
so
much
farther
than
these
men
so
he
begged
the
visitors
to
shoot
and
of
snorri
men
and
some
few
made
the
trial
but
shot
no
better
than
those
who
assayed
afore
grani
was
much
pleased
then
einar
stood
up
with
smiles
and
said
he
let
us
now
go
to
the
feast
for
it
is
ready
at
the
hall
here
cometh
one
said
snorri
who
may
wish
to
try
wait
we
here
for
yet
a
little
while
men
looked
and
there
was
a
great
man
coming
down
the
hill
and
they
knew
him
for
the
huge
fellow
who
had
been
lolling
across
the
valley
on
his
shoulder
he
bore
a
bill
with
a
shaft
big
as
a
beam
coming
so
down
the
hillside
above
them
he
looked
so
large
that
einar
was
uneasy
wondering
what
champion
he
should
be
the
sun
was
behind
him
and
he
seemed
like
one
who
might
do
all
manner
of
feats
of
strength
even
to
making
the
long
shot
with
the
bow
einar
felt
fear
but
when
the
large
man
reached
the
first
of
the
people
and
they
could
see
his
face
then
laughter
began
among
them
and
one
cried
aloud
is
only
frodi
the
smith
so
frodi
came
before
them
and
einar
was
wroth
because
he
had
feared
such
an
one
who
was
all
softness
said
einar
what
dost
thou
here
with
that
great
weapon
at
our
feast
where
no
man
comes
in
war
seekest
thou
to
take
up
the
feud
for
this
land
and
he
gave
sign
that
his
men
should
be
near
ready
to
seize
frodi
if
only
cause
were
given
but
frodi
laid
the
bill
at
the
feet
of
einar
and
said
i
bring
thee
the
bill
which
is
thine
own
since
it
came
ashore
on
thy
beaches
as
for
that
feud
it
is
not
mine
but
it
belongs
to
the
nearest
of
kin
who
knows
where
he
is
let
me
stay
here
a
space
i
beg
and
watch
the
shooting
the
shooting
is
past
said
einar
but
stay
if
it
pleases
thee
as
for
that
bill
keep
it
for
thine
own
if
it
is
at
all
dear
to
thee
then
he
turned
to
snorri
and
said
shall
we
not
go
to
the
feast
but
tell
us
of
this
great
bill
said
snorri
and
were
there
not
perchance
other
heathen
weapons
which
are
thine
coming
ashore
in
that
great
storm
so
grani
told
of
the
bill
how
it
had
belonged
to
that
dead
viking
and
he
said
there
had
been
a
bow
with
it
which
was
useless
because
no
one
could
string
it
much
would
i
like
to
see
that
bow
says
snorri
grani
knows
not
what
to
answer
and
looks
at
einar
and
einar
looks
back
at
grani
but
at
last
einar
says
old
and
useless
is
the
bow
and
it
is
in
some
place
come
now
to
the
feast
for
it
is
all
ready
it
is
not
yet
noon
answered
snorri
and
before
noon
i
am
never
ready
to
feast
but
here
comes
another
one
down
the
hill
who
may
give
us
sport
until
we
sit
down
so
men
looked
again
up
the
hillside
and
there
was
another
figure
coming
seen
against
the
sun
now
in
iceland
even
in
summer
noon
the
sun
never
stands
overhead
fast
the
figure
strode
all
muffled
in
a
cloak
which
flapped
in
the
wind
and
so
wild
and
large
did
the
newcomer
seem
that
again
einar
was
afraid
at
the
strange
sight
but
when
it
came
near
the
figure
dwindled
and
the
people
laughed
again
crying
to
make
way
for
thurid
with
slow
and
halting
step
the
crone
came
through
the
lane
of
men
to
einar
wishes
the
strange
woman
anything
here
asked
snorri
give
her
money
said
einar
to
ondott
and
bid
her
begone
but
she
turned
her
back
on
ondott
with
his
purse
and
went
nearer
einar
and
then
she
saw
the
bill
which
frodi
had
left
lying
at
feet
a
strong
shudder
seized
her
and
there
she
stood
shuddering
gazing
beneath
her
hood
at
that
great
weapon
what
is
wrong
with
the
woman
asked
snorri
as
if
impatient
bid
her
to
speak
she
speaks
never
answered
einar
but
it
seemed
as
if
she
were
talking
to
herself
for
first
she
began
to
mumble
hoarsely
and
then
a
little
louder
and
then
at
last
she
began
to
drone
a
song
in
a
cracked
voice
which
to
those
who
had
known
her
seemed
not
her
own
she
sang
thus
here
is
come
from
foreign
shore
a
heathen
weapon
and
one
more
first
the
bill
which
can
be
swung
by
the
peaceful
smith
alone
next
the
bow
which
can
be
strung
nor
by
him
nor
anyone
yet
i
say
in
one
of
those
laid
in
spells
by
christ
his
foes
danger
lies
to
einar
house
when
she
had
sung
thus
she
drew
her
hood
still
closer
over
her
head
and
crouched
down
there
by
the
dais
mark
now
all
that
which
next
was
said
and
done
as
if
those
visitors
knew
the
fearsome
nature
of
einar
and
played
with
it
first
kolbein
drew
his
feet
away
from
the
blade
of
the
bill
which
lay
before
them
and
he
looked
uneasy
saying
to
einar
of
human
force
i
have
no
fear
but
evil
and
witchcraft
like
i
not
but
snorri
leaned
forward
and
looked
in
the
face
of
frodi
tell
us
says
snorri
the
priest
for
what
reason
thou
hast
brought
the
bill
here
answered
frodi
i
live
alone
in
my
smithy
and
the
bill
stands
always
in
the
corner
now
sometimes
it
gives
out
a
strong
humming
there
as
i
work
or
as
i
sit
by
myself
of
nights
and
at
such
times
i
think
evil
thoughts
of
vengeance
longing
to
do
violence
with
the
bill
until
sometimes
i
fear
i
will
snatch
the
weapon
and
rush
forth
and
slay
and
methinks
the
thing
must
be
like
the
terrible
bill
of
gunnar
of
lithend
which
before
every
one
of
his
slayings
gave
forth
a
singing
sound
yet
gunnar
got
his
bill
by
the
mere
death
of
a
man
but
i
won
this
in
fight
with
a
ghost
and
so
i
fear
more
dreadful
things
will
happen
from
mine
than
ever
came
from
his
lest
come
on
my
soul
i
brought
the
bill
hither
to
restore
it
to
its
rightful
owner
but
he
gave
it
thee
again
says
snorri
so
answered
frodi
i
see
no
way
at
all
to
avoid
that
thou
canst
cast
the
bill
in
the
sea
says
snorri
on
a
sudden
frodi
started
back
from
the
bill
and
clutched
at
the
clothes
on
his
breast
and
cried
heard
ye
how
it
hummed
even
then
said
grani
i
heard
naught
but
kolbein
hitched
his
stool
further
away
from
the
bill
saying
i
heard
something
snorri
looked
upon
einar
who
was
pale
with
fear
now
said
snorri
what
of
that
bow
which
if
shooting
here
at
this
boundary
may
cost
thee
thy
life
is
mayhap
the
greater
danger
to
thee
of
the
two
einar
answered
nothing
come
says
snorri
do
this
if
thou
wouldst
avoid
all
evil
cast
this
bill
and
that
bow
into
the
sea
now
the
crone
rose
up
again
and
she
sang
this
song
bring
ye
here
those
weapons
forth
lay
them
crossing
east
and
north
here
upon
the
fateful
ground
where
death
hiarandi
found
over
them
make
ye
the
sign
of
the
church
with
holy
wine
build
ye
then
a
fire
great
ere
the
flames
to
coals
abate
cast
those
weapons
in
them
here
power
of
spells
will
disappear
no
fate
then
need
einar
fear
now
said
snorri
this
burning
is
the
best
counsel
for
weapons
cast
in
the
sea
would
come
again
to
shore
then
thurid
covered
her
head
again
and
crouched
down
as
before
but
einar
rose
in
a
panic
and
bade
grani
fetch
the
bow
the
arrows
and
some
wine
grani
departed
hastily
and
ran
to
the
hall
and
called
his
sister
bidding
her
bring
wine
while
he
got
the
bow
and
arrows
now
cried
helga
wilt
thou
mock
the
death
of
hiarandi
and
jeer
at
rolf
who
saved
thy
life
here
on
the
rocks
what
sayest
thou
of
saving
my
life
asked
grani
helga
told
how
rolf
and
frodi
had
borne
him
to
shore
be
comforted
said
grani
no
man
shoots
with
the
great
bow
for
rolf
who
alone
can
string
it
is
away
but
witchcraft
lies
in
it
and
it
shall
be
burnt
and
when
this
feast
is
ended
i
will
send
for
rolf
and
offer
him
peace
and
friendship
no
peace
comes
from
rolf
answers
helga
while
we
own
his
lands
nor
friendship
while
we
sit
in
his
hall
violence
meets
violence
so
says
the
good
book
but
she
went
and
got
the
wine
and
grani
seized
the
bow
and
its
quiver
from
out
the
rick
and
bore
all
to
the
brookside
again
there
the
fire
was
already
built
snorri
received
the
bow
in
his
hands
for
neither
kolbein
nor
einar
would
touch
it
the
priest
of
snorri
household
took
the
wine
to
hallow
it
and
snorri
drew
the
bow
from
its
case
let
all
give
back
said
he
make
space
for
the
fire
and
the
burning
of
the
bow
let
the
crone
say
when
all
is
ready
so
all
men
gave
space
and
the
and
the
guests
mingled
together
made
a
great
circle
round
the
spot
where
the
bow
should
be
burnt
with
the
bill
at
only
one
place
the
ring
was
broken
the
shelving
bank
of
the
brook
where
men
might
not
stand
then
thurid
rose
and
began
to
circle
the
fire
thrice
around
it
she
walked
and
snorri
with
the
bow
came
down
from
the
dais
and
stood
near
but
kolbein
went
and
stood
by
grani
and
frodi
kept
his
place
at
the
feet
of
einar
so
when
the
cloaked
woman
had
circled
the
fire
three
times
she
stopped
and
said
to
snorri
give
me
the
bow
snorri
gave
it
her
all
watched
to
see
what
she
would
do
whether
mutter
spells
or
breathe
upon
it
but
she
looked
at
it
carefully
from
end
to
end
and
overlooked
the
string
and
after
that
she
raised
it
and
shook
it
aloft
then
first
men
saw
any
part
of
her
namely
her
arm
which
was
not
withered
but
firm
and
large
like
a
man
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
no
longer
cracked
water
hath
not
harmed
thee
oh
my
bow
thou
art
the
same
as
when
thou
slewest
the
baresark
now
shalt
thou
do
a
greater
deed
and
in
a
moment
she
set
the
end
of
the
bow
to
her
foot
and
bent
the
bow
and
slipped
the
string
along
and
the
bow
was
strung
there
stood
the
homefolk
gazing
but
the
crone
cast
off
the
cloak
no
woman
was
she
at
all
but
rolf
in
his
weapons
then
frodi
laid
his
hand
on
einar
knee
and
said
sit
still
kolbein
set
a
knife
to
grani
throat
saying
thy
life
if
thou
stirrest
and
snorri
cried
on
high
where
are
ye
men
of
tongue
and
swinefell
all
those
guests
drew
their
and
it
was
seen
that
by
every
one
of
the
homefolk
was
a
man
of
snorri
or
kolbein
or
haply
two
of
them
they
threatened
death
to
all
of
einar
folk
rolf
looked
around
on
his
enemies
and
there
was
not
one
that
could
either
fight
or
flee
so
he
took
the
quiver
from
snorri
and
looked
within
it
he
chose
that
arrow
with
the
silver
point
and
snapped
the
silken
thread
that
bound
it
and
drew
the
arrow
forth
at
no
man
he
looked
but
up
to
heaven
then
he
set
the
arrow
on
the
string
he
drew
the
bow
and
sped
the
shaft
high
it
flew
and
far
across
the
brook
across
the
mead
it
passed
through
the
upper
branches
of
the
little
oak
and
fell
to
the
ground
three
roods
beyond
then
in
the
sight
of
all
rolf
bowed
his
head
nor
for
a
while
could
he
speak
at
all
but
when
at
last
he
turned
again
toward
that
high
seat
where
einar
sat
his
eye
fell
first
on
ondott
who
stood
by
said
rolf
bring
me
that
fellow
here
yet
when
they
would
seize
ondott
he
slipped
away
and
fearing
death
ran
shrieking
up
the
hill
with
men
in
chase
such
was
his
speed
that
they
caught
him
not
so
great
was
his
fright
that
he
recked
not
where
he
was
going
he
ran
to
the
cliffs
nor
saw
them
from
their
top
he
fell
and
died
so
is
the
greater
villain
gone
said
rolf
when
all
saw
ondott
fall
but
the
less
remains
einar
ondott
hath
made
his
choice
of
death
and
life
what
choice
makest
thou
wilt
thou
bring
this
to
the
courts
where
outlawry
is
sure
or
wilt
thou
handsel
the
case
to
me
to
utter
my
own
award
for
the
death
of
my
father
and
the
seizing
of
my
land
einar
said
quickly
on
thy
mercy
i
rely
and
i
handsel
all
to
thee
for
i
am
too
old
to
fare
abroad
so
he
came
down
from
the
dais
and
hastened
to
rolf
offering
his
hand
and
calling
snorri
to
witness
that
handselling
there
they
struck
hands
before
all
those
witnesses
said
rolf
now
i
hold
in
my
hands
thy
death
or
thy
life
even
as
once
thou
heldest
my
father
at
thy
mercy
no
pity
hadst
thou
then
shall
i
spare
thee
now
it
was
all
ondott
doing
said
einar
now
quoth
rolf
this
do
i
award
and
thy
forgetting
it
will
be
thy
death
thou
shalt
go
to
the
little
farm
where
my
mother
has
lived
but
now
she
is
on
her
way
to
cragness
on
those
few
acres
thou
shalt
abide
and
stay
within
all
space
a
bowshot
from
it
the
one
ewe
which
is
there
thou
mayest
have
the
store
of
meat
which
is
in
the
loft
is
thine
my
mother
gray
cloak
hangs
by
the
door
take
it
but
thine
own
livelihood
thou
shalt
earn
from
the
soil
when
these
are
spent
and
when
thou
comest
from
thy
boundary
farther
than
this
bow
can
shoot
thy
life
is
forfeit
to
me
einar
accepted
that
award
then
rolf
turned
to
grani
and
said
grani
it
lies
in
thy
power
to
change
all
this
by
uttering
two
words
grani
said
nothing
only
two
words
said
rolf
again
but
still
grani
answered
nothing
and
rolf
turned
from
him
sadly
proud
is
the
heart
of
youth
quoth
snorri
come
let
us
sheathe
our
weapons
the
sun
stands
at
noon
now
shall
we
execute
the
act
of
distress
which
will
make
rolf
master
of
his
own
yes
and
of
the
half
of
einar
wealth
for
the
rest
goes
to
the
men
of
the
quarter
let
us
go
to
the
hall
so
all
men
went
to
the
hall
and
there
went
not
only
those
guests
from
afar
but
also
those
from
the
dales
aye
and
the
men
of
einar
left
him
and
went
to
the
hall
with
the
others
only
grani
stayed
with
his
father
and
helga
whom
anxiety
had
driven
from
the
hall
let
us
go
to
our
new
home
said
einar
so
they
went
and
from
the
first
hilltop
they
saw
how
the
act
of
distress
was
beginning
at
the
crags
but
from
the
second
hilltop
they
saw
that
the
act
was
finished
and
when
they
rested
on
the
long
climb
to
the
hut
whence
asdis
had
gone
to
her
own
old
home
they
saw
how
outside
the
hall
men
were
seated
at
the
long
tables
and
the
women
passed
the
food
and
drink
and
all
was
merry
at
cragness
chapter
xxix
of
the
trial
of
grants
pride
gay
was
that
harvest
feast
and
all
men
learned
how
thurid
had
died
in
the
snow
on
the
night
of
the
wreck
in
her
cloak
had
rolf
lived
serving
his
mother
and
he
had
travelled
to
tongue
and
swinefell
in
order
to
make
the
plan
for
gaining
his
own
but
because
flosi
could
not
come
he
had
sent
kolbein
his
son
rolf
gave
great
thanks
to
snorri
and
kolbein
and
gifts
beside
with
all
good
wishes
they
parted
on
the
morrow
then
asdis
took
over
the
care
of
the
household
of
her
son
and
frodi
was
bidden
to
live
there
with
them
they
began
again
the
custom
of
hiarandi
to
light
beacons
against
shipwreck
so
now
rolf
dwells
at
cragness
in
his
honor
but
at
the
hut
on
the
upland
those
others
live
with
little
ease
rolf
looks
out
sometimes
at
the
little
farm
and
sees
grani
and
his
father
working
in
the
field
to
get
in
the
small
harvest
hay
for
the
ewe
and
grain
for
themselves
now
for
asdis
alone
that
store
had
been
enough
but
for
three
the
outlook
was
not
so
good
once
frodi
saw
rolf
as
he
watched
them
working
and
the
smith
said
thou
takest
pleasure
in
the
sight
rolf
asked
rememberest
thou
what
jewels
grani
wore
or
his
father
or
helga
that
time
when
they
went
away
grani
and
einar
said
frodi
had
rings
on
their
arms
and
brooches
on
their
breasts
but
helga
wore
none
at
all
silver
pennies
also
they
had
in
their
purses
said
rolf
what
is
their
wealth
to
thee
asks
frodi
much
answers
rolf
now
the
time
draws
toward
winter
the
tale
tells
next
how
rolf
kept
many
people
by
him
in
the
hall
to
do
the
field
work
and
to
tend
the
cattle
and
horses
but
the
sheep
were
in
the
fold
save
twenty
which
had
not
come
in
now
some
of
those
folk
of
einar
still
dwelt
at
cragness
having
deserted
their
master
and
none
at
the
hall
bade
them
either
go
or
stay
yet
both
asdis
and
frodi
showed
them
little
favor
and
one
by
one
they
slipped
away
to
seek
livings
elsewhere
save
only
those
two
hallvard
and
hallmund
men
of
loud
talk
strong
of
growth
but
not
given
to
work
evenings
in
the
hall
they
spoke
much
and
frodi
scowled
thereat
but
rolf
sat
in
his
seat
and
seemed
neither
to
see
nor
to
hear
them
frodi
said
to
him
one
day
this
one
thing
i
mislike
in
thee
that
thou
keepest
here
those
two
who
deserted
their
master
rolf
asked
was
their
master
worth
devotion
maybe
not
says
frodi
yet
ingrates
are
they
both
they
are
free
said
rolf
either
to
stay
or
go
frodi
grumbled
to
himself
but
said
no
more
to
rolf
now
october
comes
in
very
cold
but
no
snow
as
yet
and
all
harvests
are
in
grani
had
stacked
his
neatly
in
ricks
against
the
weather
for
there
was
no
room
in
the
hut
there
was
a
pen
outside
for
the
ewe
she
was
a
good
beast
and
never
wandered
coming
home
at
night
on
a
day
rolf
called
hallvard
and
hallmund
to
him
and
said
it
were
not
strange
if
grani
ewe
were
to
break
out
of
its
pen
and
eat
at
my
ricks
which
stand
not
far
away
and
he
looked
hard
at
hallvard
who
was
the
slyer
of
those
two
said
hallvard
with
a
grin
that
is
likely
to
happen
rolf
gave
them
each
a
piece
of
money
and
said
beware
of
that
ewe
on
a
morning
not
long
after
came
those
two
leading
the
ewe
master
here
have
we
found
this
ewe
eating
at
thy
ricks
nor
know
we
whose
it
may
be
said
rolf
the
ewe
is
einar
take
it
to
him
and
ask
payment
for
the
hay
which
has
been
eaten
so
they
take
the
ewe
to
einar
and
bring
back
silver
keep
that
for
yourselves
rolf
said
but
will
the
ewe
stay
now
at
home
her
pen
is
not
strong
hallvard
said
so
on
the
morrow
those
two
came
again
bringing
the
ewe
a
second
time
rolf
sent
them
for
money
as
before
this
time
they
brought
back
a
gold
so
rolf
knew
that
einar
and
grani
had
taken
with
them
nigh
empty
purses
and
he
was
glad
he
took
the
ring
giving
the
men
silver
and
said
to
them
as
before
will
the
ewe
stay
now
at
home
hallvard
answered
we
left
grani
strengthening
the
pen
but
still
it
is
not
high
and
on
the
morrow
they
brought
the
ewe
saying
see
how
fat
she
hath
gorged
herself
master
then
said
rolf
go
now
and
say
to
einar
third
time
hath
thine
ewe
trespassed
now
must
thou
pay
not
only
damages
but
the
trespass
fine
or
else
bring
this
to
the
courts
they
went
and
brought
back
jewels
one
and
two
brooches
and
hallvard
said
all
that
he
had
einar
gave
rather
than
trust
himself
to
the
law
rolf
gave
them
money
saying
if
the
ewe
wanders
a
fourth
time
she
will
become
mine
is
her
pen
strong
grani
has
no
more
wood
to
make
the
pen
higher
answered
hallvard
but
he
was
tying
her
with
a
rope
belike
the
rope
is
not
strong
said
rolf
and
that
seemed
true
for
on
the
morrow
those
two
brought
the
ewe
for
the
fourth
time
they
said
she
had
again
been
eating
at
rolfs
ricks
go
now
said
rolf
say
to
einar
me
damages
and
another
fine
or
yield
thine
ewe
they
went
and
returned
and
said
to
rolf
the
ewe
is
thine
then
rolf
gave
them
silver
rings
and
they
were
well
content
but
frodi
came
to
rolf
and
said
what
is
this
thou
hast
suffered
those
two
to
do
to
thy
neighbor
now
einar
will
have
no
milk
for
the
winter
rolf
answered
shortly
he
can
use
the
pen
of
the
ewe
for
firewood
and
sell
the
hay
for
money
and
he
would
speak
no
more
of
that
now
october
passed
and
november
came
and
still
there
was
no
snow
the
land
was
colder
for
that
one
day
when
rolf
stood
and
looked
at
the
hut
on
the
upland
hallvard
came
to
him
and
said
small
cheer
is
there
over
yonder
master
yet
i
have
heard
that
grani
has
sold
his
hay
and
it
is
soon
to
be
fetched
from
his
farm
rolf
answered
see
now
how
all
their
ricks
stand
in
a
line
and
the
wind
is
in
that
line
so
that
a
fire
which
took
the
weathermost
rick
would
burn
them
all
it
was
careless
of
grani
to
set
them
so
for
fire
might
come
by
chance
said
hallvard
and
he
went
and
spoke
with
hallmund
now
that
night
people
were
stirring
in
the
hall
for
a
servingman
was
sick
there
and
in
the
early
morning
one
came
knocking
at
the
door
of
rolfs
locked
bed
crying
there
is
fire
across
the
valley
so
rolf
threw
on
a
cloak
and
went
out
there
was
a
great
fire
at
the
little
farm
where
the
ricks
were
burning
in
their
light
grani
was
seen
saving
what
he
might
but
einar
stood
by
wringing
his
hands
and
helga
weeping
so
while
those
of
cragness
stood
and
watched
hallvard
and
hallmund
came
up
the
hill
and
joined
them
where
have
ye
been
asks
frodi
they
had
no
good
answer
to
give
when
it
was
day
rolf
sent
to
inquire
of
einar
if
he
had
had
great
loss
hallvard
was
sent
and
ask
if
they
will
have
any
help
of
me
and
mark
how
much
they
have
saved
and
where
it
is
bestowed
so
hallvard
went
and
returned
again
and
said
that
grani
needed
no
help
but
said
he
the
old
man
would
have
taken
help
yet
the
young
man
would
not
allow
it
and
they
have
saved
no
hay
and
but
little
grain
it
is
there
in
the
pen
of
the
ewe
now
rolf
said
privately
to
hallvard
thou
and
hallmund
shall
take
my
shepherd
and
go
into
the
hills
a
day
journey
he
shall
show
thee
where
are
folded
those
twenty
of
my
sheep
which
came
not
with
the
others
and
which
men
call
lost
send
him
then
home
before
thee
and
do
ye
twain
drive
the
and
see
to
it
quoth
rolf
that
those
sheep
do
no
damage
to
the
fodder
which
grani
saved
so
that
day
those
two
took
their
staves
and
went
with
the
shepherd
to
do
as
rolf
had
bidden
on
the
second
day
the
shepherd
came
again
but
on
the
fourth
came
hallvard
and
hallmund
driving
the
sheep
now
one
of
them
was
all
bloody
what
hath
happened
to
the
ram
asked
rolf
we
came
home
answered
hallvard
over
the
fell
which
is
above
einar
farm
we
pastured
the
sheep
as
we
came
yet
there
is
now
no
good
grazing
and
the
beasts
were
terribly
thin
so
when
we
came
late
at
night
near
to
grani
stead
and
could
not
make
cragness
in
the
dark
we
rested
and
let
the
sheep
stray
in
the
morning
behold
the
sheep
had
found
the
grain
which
grani
had
saved
from
the
fire
and
were
eating
the
last
of
it
when
he
came
out
by
the
first
light
he
saw
the
sheep
and
drove
them
thence
with
fury
but
the
ram
was
obstinate
and
would
not
leave
the
food
so
grani
wounded
him
and
he
gave
us
hard
words
before
we
gathered
the
flock
to
come
away
take
the
sheep
to
the
fold
said
rolf
and
he
gave
each
of
the
men
a
piece
of
money
then
he
went
in
and
sat
down
to
meat
but
frodi
followed
him
and
seemed
much
discontented
what
ails
thee
asked
rolf
this
ails
me
said
frodi
that
thou
hast
no
mercy
upon
them
whose
lot
is
hard
enough
i
can
not
bear
that
thou
shouldst
use
those
base
men
to
do
such
work
against
grani
whom
once
thou
lovedst
for
i
perceive
clearly
that
all
this
has
been
done
with
intention
both
the
trespassing
of
the
ewe
and
the
burning
of
the
ricks
likewise
this
last
happening
is
not
by
chance
what
change
is
on
thee
that
thou
doest
so
also
asdis
came
and
said
thou
art
hard
on
those
unfortunate
ones
my
son
leave
this
persecution
and
do
what
is
worthy
of
thee
but
rolf
said
to
frodi
hast
thou
forgotten
that
grani
made
thee
thrall
and
of
asdis
he
asked
who
slew
hiarandi
my
father
the
law
of
vengeance
came
to
their
minds
and
they
were
silent
yet
not
satisfied
then
hallvard
and
hallmund
came
in
and
helped
themselves
to
meat
and
began
talking
loudly
said
hallvard
thou
art
called
now
master
to
avenge
thy
honor
einar
spoke
shame
on
thee
while
we
were
gathering
the
sheep
to
drive
from
his
house
for
he
said
thou
hadst
the
hope
to
starve
him
and
his
children
a
great
slander
is
that
quoth
hallmund
wagging
his
head
many
a
man
hath
died
for
such
and
at
least
a
should
einar
pay
hold
your
tongues
cried
frodi
in
anger
but
rolf
rebuked
frodi
and
said
to
those
twain
i
give
thanks
for
your
thought
of
mine
honor
but
i
do
not
desire
blood
only
for
the
slander
einar
hath
no
money
but
grani
hath
yet
his
sword
a
fine
weapon
now
you
who
have
my
honor
in
your
care
go
to
grani
tell
him
i
demand
atonement
but
if
he
sends
me
his
sword
his
father
slander
will
be
forgotten
those
two
looked
at
each
other
in
doubt
for
that
would
be
a
hard
thing
to
get
from
grani
his
sword
but
frodi
sprang
from
his
seat
and
cried
what
dost
thou
now
to
insult
grani
so
never
will
an
icelander
yield
his
sword
call
now
to
mind
when
ye
two
were
comrades
and
slept
together
and
fought
the
scots
together
and
crossed
the
pentland
firth
together
in
a
little
boat
and
swam
the
last
mile
side
by
side
put
all
this
in
thy
mind
and
unsay
what
thou
hast
said
rolf
answered
all
this
i
remember
and
that
is
why
i
send
for
grani
sword
then
frodi
cried
i
leave
thy
roof
now
nor
ever
are
we
friends
again
frodi
answered
rolf
sleep
one
night
more
under
my
roof
then
if
thou
art
minded
thou
shalt
leave
me
forever
then
frodi
called
to
mind
his
great
love
for
his
cousin
and
yielded
and
sat
down
in
the
morning
hallmund
and
hallvard
sat
late
at
meat
rolf
said
to
them
why
linger
ye
here
do
as
i
bade
then
they
took
swords
axes
and
shields
and
went
to
the
hut
across
the
valley
but
had
no
heart
in
their
going
now
rolf
watched
from
the
hillside
and
he
saw
them
go
into
the
farmyard
very
slowly
and
he
waited
a
while
and
saw
them
come
out
very
slowly
and
they
came
back
to
cragness
and
climbed
the
hill
to
him
and
behold
they
had
not
their
arms
any
more
but
were
wounded
and
complained
as
they
came
grani
said
they
has
done
this
to
us
now
master
avenge
us
on
him
now
said
rolf
all
is
come
about
as
i
wished
and
he
bade
bring
his
sword
and
his
shield
wilt
thou
then
asked
frodi
take
up
the
quarrel
of
these
wretched
carles
rolf
put
on
his
sword
and
took
his
shield
he
made
no
answer
to
frodi
but
he
beckoned
his
housecarles
and
pointed
to
hallvard
and
hallmund
whip
me
said
rolf
to
his
servants
these
wretches
from
this
place
if
they
wait
till
my
return
they
shall
feel
the
weight
of
my
hand
but
as
for
all
the
rest
of
you
bide
ye
here
till
i
come
again
hallvard
and
hallmund
ran
with
all
haste
away
along
the
cliffs
but
rolf
set
out
across
the
valley
to
the
little
farm
chapter
xxx
of
the
saying
of
those
two
words
now
the
tale
turns
to
speak
of
einar
and
his
two
children
how
they
went
away
from
their
home
with
but
the
clothes
on
their
backs
and
with
purses
nigh
empty
and
but
little
jewelry
they
came
to
the
hut
to
make
a
home
where
there
was
no
room
for
a
fourth
to
sleep
and
where
there
was
but
a
rack
of
dried
meat
and
a
gray
cloak
hanging
by
the
door
and
little
else
for
comfort
grani
looks
about
the
farm
and
sees
how
it
has
a
good
spring
and
a
small
garden
well
tended
and
a
pen
for
the
ewe
beyond
the
garden
were
the
other
crops
yet
the
hay
had
not
been
cut
nor
the
grain
reaped
and
there
was
nothing
stored
against
the
winter
said
grani
rolf
awaited
this
turn
of
fortune
and
why
should
he
lay
up
food
for
us
then
he
turned
about
and
looked
off
from
the
hillside
there
he
saw
cragness
and
the
folk
feasting
and
he
saw
fellstead
and
many
other
farms
there
lay
broadfirth
and
the
sea
beyond
fishing
vessels
were
thereon
and
he
saw
the
ferry
to
hvamm
with
all
the
four
roads
which
led
to
it
where
people
travelled
but
the
little
farm
was
far
away
from
all
these
things
now
it
was
a
bright
warm
day
and
the
ewe
bleated
in
the
pasture
and
the
birds
called
each
other
above
his
head
then
grani
heart
fainted
within
him
and
he
cried
to
einar
better
hadst
thou
chosen
exile
for
us
all
rather
than
condemn
us
to
die
in
this
place
einar
sought
to
excuse
himself
to
his
son
but
appeased
him
not
then
helga
said
is
this
all
thou
didst
learn
in
the
orkneys
thus
to
meet
the
fate
which
thou
hast
brought
upon
thyself
then
grani
was
quiet
and
went
and
fetched
water
and
wood
which
was
there
for
the
cooking
but
there
was
no
great
store
after
a
while
he
said
to
his
sister
no
more
will
i
complain
though
worse
things
come
upon
us
so
in
the
following
days
he
sets
himself
to
work
and
cuts
the
hay
and
stacks
it
in
ricks
and
cuts
and
stacks
the
grain
likewise
working
hastily
lest
the
snow
should
come
einar
was
of
no
account
in
such
work
for
his
body
was
not
used
to
it
but
he
watches
the
ewe
upon
the
mead
and
fetches
water
and
helga
works
at
the
house
and
when
the
grain
is
reaped
she
begins
to
grind
it
in
a
handmill
a
slow
labor
that
was
to
make
flour
each
day
for
their
bread
now
when
grani
had
finished
harvesting
he
began
to
cut
peat
and
stack
it
near
the
house
it
was
hard
work
for
the
cold
was
severe
and
the
ground
freezing
einar
began
to
complain
as
the
cold
came
on
he
was
not
warm
enough
under
the
gray
cloak
but
sat
much
of
the
day
by
the
fire
he
disliked
his
food
and
wanted
better
although
naught
better
was
to
be
had
it
was
not
easy
to
bear
his
complainings
but
helga
was
patient
and
grani
sought
to
lighten
her
labors
doing
woman
work
yet
he
was
troubled
for
the
shame
of
his
life
and
slept
badly
and
lost
flesh
now
hard
frost
and
bitter
winds
came
but
still
no
snow
clothes
were
thin
and
he
was
not
used
to
the
rough
life
his
hands
cracked
with
the
cold
all
his
joints
ached
his
feet
were
sore
from
his
thin
shoes
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
would
perish
with
the
wind
yet
still
he
cut
peat
hewing
it
from
the
frozen
ground
in
a
little
boggy
place
and
he
brought
it
home
with
fingers
all
bleeding
then
helga
bewailed
the
weather
how
without
snow
the
ground
froze
ever
deeper
but
though
at
first
grani
was
minded
to
complain
with
her
he
bethought
himself
and
spoke
cheerily
helga
asked
why
dost
thou
conceal
thy
thoughts
the
worst
of
my
thoughts
said
grani
are
so
bad
that
i
dare
not
dwell
on
them
but
the
better
is
that
i
must
be
manly
and
i
have
a
memory
to
help
me
what
is
that
memory
asked
helga
so
grani
told
of
that
time
when
he
and
his
thralls
were
lost
in
the
snow
in
orkney
and
those
two
icelanders
bore
the
cold
but
he
complained
of
it
and
they
gave
me
the
cloak
and
the
warmth
of
their
own
bodies
yet
i
could
not
be
brave
so
now
when
i
shiver
in
the
cold
i
call
to
mind
their
hardiness
and
strive
to
copy
it
that
is
well
said
quoth
helga
and
i
will
show
courage
even
as
thou
so
those
two
fortified
each
other
but
einar
mind
dwelt
always
on
his
misfortunes
the
great
state
he
had
lost
and
the
trick
that
had
betrayed
him
and
all
those
servants
who
had
deserted
him
years
long
said
einar
i
fed
many
of
those
men
yet
they
all
turned
from
me
at
the
end
not
one
had
the
gratitude
to
follow
me
hither
there
is
luck
in
that
answered
grani
for
how
could
we
feed
them
most
i
hate
hallvard
and
hallmund
said
einar
for
i
favored
them
in
everything
but
now
they
cling
to
rolf
he
will
get
small
profit
from
them
says
helga
now
at
the
farm
they
took
much
comfort
in
their
ewe
which
never
wandered
far
and
came
home
at
night
sleeping
always
in
the
pen
but
one
morning
she
was
gone
and
the
pen
broken
down
and
no
trace
of
her
was
to
be
seen
then
einar
lamented
greatly
since
her
milk
was
needed
he
declared
that
she
was
stolen
but
in
the
forenoon
came
those
two
hallvard
and
hallmund
leading
the
ewe
this
beast
said
hallvard
was
found
eating
from
our
masters
ricks
wherefore
asked
grani
ate
she
not
from
our
ricks
which
were
nearer
i
know
not
said
hallvard
but
she
hath
been
at
our
ricks
and
rolf
has
said
twenty
in
silver
must
you
pay
grani
took
his
purse
and
though
his
father
scolded
he
gave
silver
all
that
he
had
and
hallvard
and
hallmund
went
away
now
this
happened
again
and
to
redeem
the
ewe
grani
gave
a
gold
ring
then
he
built
up
the
pen
again
of
double
strength
so
that
a
bullock
could
not
have
broken
out
but
on
another
morning
the
ewe
was
gone
and
unless
she
were
a
goat
she
might
not
have
jumped
out
einar
was
terribly
enraged
with
an
old
mans
anger
and
swore
those
two
ruffians
had
killed
the
ewe
yet
after
a
while
they
were
seen
coming
leading
the
beast
einar
said
to
grani
take
now
thy
sword
and
slay
them
when
they
come
but
grani
held
his
tongue
and
heard
those
two
quietly
when
they
claimed
trespass
money
he
gave
them
all
the
jewels
that
he
had
and
the
twain
went
away
then
einar
cried
i
have
no
son
at
all
but
two
daughters
and
no
one
will
defend
me
from
this
shameful
persecution
grani
grew
red
as
blood
but
he
said
naught
in
answer
and
tied
the
ewe
in
the
pen
when
he
was
alone
helga
came
to
him
asks
she
thinkest
thou
that
the
ewe
broke
out
those
two
times
and
leaped
out
the
third
he
answers
those
two
stole
her
yet
i
can
not
prove
it
for
there
is
no
snow
to
show
their
tracks
i
blame
not
thy
mildness
at
all
says
helga
rather
do
i
praise
it
but
why
art
thou
so
quiet
under
injustice
i
call
to
mind
says
grani
that
when
i
enthralled
rolf
he
never
complained
but
took
what
fortune
brought
him
seeing
that
he
could
not
help
himself
he
bided
his
time
and
avenged
his
father
and
i
suffer
in
silence
to
keep
my
father
alive
that
lesson
which
rolf
set
me
now
i
follow
i
can
not
resist
him
save
to
my
death
and
what
then
would
become
of
my
father
and
of
thee
now
there
came
another
night
and
in
the
morning
the
ewe
was
gone
that
day
grani
yielded
her
to
rolf
as
already
told
while
einar
upbraided
him
that
he
was
so
unmanly
and
in
the
next
days
the
old
man
was
miserable
missing
his
milk
and
not
eating
the
broth
helga
made
though
the
broth
was
very
good
he
made
himself
sick
with
his
anger
and
his
selfishness
and
went
to
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
scolded
from
where
he
lay
men
tell
said
he
of
gisli
the
outlaw
who
entered
his
enemy
house
and
slew
him
for
the
slaying
of
his
but
nowadays
no
man
will
do
such
a
deed
no
not
to
save
his
father
then
grani
started
from
his
place
and
said
violence
enough
has
been
done
in
this
feud
nor
will
i
ever
have
hand
in
such
he
went
out
of
the
house
and
helga
after
him
she
said
to
him
be
comforted
my
brother
grani
answered
it
is
true
that
i
might
take
rolf
unawares
and
slay
him
but
i
remember
when
he
was
my
thrall
in
the
orkneys
going
with
me
everywhere
and
my
life
was
daily
in
his
hands
for
when
we
were
on
the
cliffs
he
might
have
cast
me
down
and
no
man
would
have
known
he
did
it
or
when
we
were
fishing
he
might
have
drowned
me
and
have
sailed
away
in
the
boat
but
he
never
did
evil
for
evil
and
i
remember
it
now
then
grani
planned
to
sell
his
fodder
and
the
money
would
be
welcome
but
on
another
morning
they
woke
in
the
hut
with
the
crackle
and
glare
of
fire
and
there
were
the
ricks
burning
all
of
them
grani
could
save
little
from
the
flames
now
that
was
a
great
loss
and
einar
bewailed
it
saying
that
since
the
wheat
was
gone
they
would
all
three
starve
then
by
day
they
saw
hallvard
coming
he
comes
to
insult
us
said
einar
and
egged
grani
on
to
meet
him
with
his
sword
and
wound
him
for
punishment
but
grani
received
hallvard
mildly
and
said
he
had
no
need
of
help
and
sent
him
away
now
said
einar
we
might
have
had
help
of
rolf
and
thou
hast
refused
it
grani
answered
naught
to
his
father
but
afterward
when
helga
asked
why
he
sent
hallvard
away
grani
said
what
help
gave
we
to
rolf
when
he
was
shipwrecked
at
our
door
thou
savedst
his
life
else
he
had
been
slain
in
our
hall
for
very
shame
we
can
take
no
help
of
him
now
some
days
passed
and
einar
grumbled
ceaselessly
so
that
life
with
him
was
well
nigh
unbearable
yet
he
was
the
cause
of
all
their
misfortune
in
nothing
that
she
did
might
helga
please
him
and
though
grani
had
grown
thin
with
labor
his
father
did
not
spare
the
lash
of
his
tongue
it
was
plain
that
they
had
not
enough
food
to
keep
them
through
the
winter
now
that
so
much
grain
was
gone
and
their
fate
was
much
on
grani
mind
yet
he
was
cheerful
helga
came
to
him
at
last
and
said
brother
give
me
of
thy
courage
for
with
my
fathers
harshness
and
our
hard
work
i
feel
my
heart
failing
me
on
what
thought
dost
thou
sustain
thyself
dost
thou
remember
asked
grani
that
when
we
first
came
here
i
complained
and
thou
didst
ask
had
i
learned
no
more
in
the
orkneys
than
to
bewail
my
fate
forgive
me
that
saying
begged
helga
why
not
forgive
grani
said
for
i
was
reminded
of
a
boast
i
made
to
rolf
there
on
the
cliff
by
hawksness
saying
that
i
feared
no
misfortune
and
he
answered
then
i
was
fitted
to
be
an
icelander
then
though
i
had
dwelt
so
long
in
the
orkneys
my
heart
warmed
to
my
own
land
whose
children
love
her
so
and
i
resolved
to
show
myself
an
icelander
for
the
sake
of
winning
rolf
praise
therefore
i
strive
my
sister
to
be
a
true
son
of
this
dear
iceland
and
to
bear
my
misfortunes
even
as
rolf
sends
them
mayhap
says
helga
rolf
remembers
also
that
boast
of
thine
aye
says
grani
and
mayhap
helga
says
he
sends
these
trials
only
to
test
thee
for
it
is
clear
that
they
are
of
design
so
i
have
thought
grani
answers
either
it
is
that
or
it
is
revenge
yet
rolf
has
no
spite
in
him
greatly
dost
thou
praise
him
helga
says
not
overmuch
quoth
grani
and
now
i
will
say
i
repent
my
pride
when
i
refused
his
friendship
first
at
hawksness
when
he
had
done
me
that
slight
hurt
and
then
on
the
ship
but
i
have
most
shame
that
i
offered
him
no
atonement
when
i
was
prosperous
here
in
iceland
and
he
was
in
hiding
go
to
him
now
cries
helga
ask
forgiveness
grani
answers
i
asked
it
not
when
i
might
with
honor
it
were
cowardice
to
do
so
when
i
am
under
his
feet
now
helga
wished
to
argue
against
that
but
their
father
called
them
complaining
and
there
was
no
more
of
their
talk
but
grani
while
helga
tended
on
einar
ground
corn
in
the
handmill
but
there
was
little
of
the
grain
left
and
sang
this
song
once
i
most
fortunate
met
swords
in
fight
now
sin
to
expiate
i
show
this
plight
grind
corn
to
make
my
evil
pursues
my
head
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
scarce
ever
had
a
warrior
not
in
thraldom
come
to
such
fortune
then
when
he
had
ground
enough
meal
for
another
day
he
stacked
the
grain
carefully
against
the
weather
and
went
about
other
tasks
and
that
night
slept
soundly
but
in
the
morning
waking
with
the
first
light
he
heard
as
it
were
a
scuffling
of
feet
close
outside
the
door
when
he
opened
he
saw
sheep
there
a
small
flock
eating
eagerly
at
the
grain
which
was
almost
all
gone
in
despair
he
rushed
out
upon
them
and
drove
them
away
they
all
fled
before
him
but
one
lean
old
ram
who
stood
his
ground
and
still
would
eat
then
grani
took
a
club
and
smote
the
ram
and
wounded
it
so
that
it
ran
away
next
he
saw
how
at
a
little
distance
were
hallvard
and
hallmund
who
came
and
excused
them
of
the
doings
of
the
sheep
which
had
strayed
while
the
men
slept
grani
answered
nothing
though
his
sister
wept
but
einar
was
nigh
out
of
his
mind
for
anger
and
despair
and
cursed
those
twain
and
rolf
their
master
until
grani
took
him
and
led
him
into
the
house
when
those
two
drove
the
sheep
away
einar
was
so
spent
with
rage
that
he
fell
at
last
in
a
stupor
and
grani
went
and
gathered
all
that
remained
of
the
grain
there
were
but
two
measures
of
it
left
then
as
he
gleaned
those
few
stalks
from
the
ground
where
the
sheep
had
trodden
them
and
as
he
cleansed
them
of
dust
and
saved
every
small
particle
bitterness
grew
in
him
and
then
wrath
and
he
nursed
his
wrath
all
that
day
now
helga
was
busy
with
her
father
and
saw
not
how
grani
brooded
there
was
not
much
food
for
him
but
he
fed
on
his
despair
and
he
slept
ill
that
night
and
rose
early
and
went
without
food
to
dig
in
the
garden
for
roots
there
those
twain
found
him
hallvard
and
hallmund
when
they
came
into
the
yard
that
day
for
his
sword
now
his
back
was
toward
them
and
they
asked
each
other
shall
we
rush
on
him
and
wound
him
or
slay
him
and
so
search
the
place
at
our
will
for
his
sword
that
seemed
to
them
the
best
counsel
and
they
stole
upon
him
he
was
so
busy
that
he
heard
them
not
and
but
for
helga
he
had
been
slain
but
she
saw
the
men
and
cried
beware
so
grani
turned
with
his
spade
uplifted
and
they
rushed
at
him
then
he
dashed
the
sword
from
the
hand
of
hallmund
and
struck
fiercely
at
hallvard
hallvard
he
wounded
with
the
spade
but
hallmund
with
his
own
weapon
and
with
their
wounds
they
limped
away
then
all
of
grani
anger
left
him
and
he
sat
in
the
house
by
the
hearth
and
his
father
waked
and
looked
at
him
said
grani
much
didst
thou
do
to
hiarandi
for
my
sake
and
harshly
has
hiarandi
son
repaid
me
for
thy
sake
but
let
us
forgive
each
other
father
before
the
end
of
life
comes
to
us
asked
einar
how
comes
the
end
of
life
now
helga
says
from
the
doorway
i
see
rolf
coming
across
the
valley
and
he
is
armed
thus
comes
the
end
says
grani
and
they
embraced
and
kissed
each
other
all
three
and
grani
made
ready
for
death
and
he
went
out
to
meet
rolf
rolf
came
into
the
yard
and
he
had
his
sword
and
shield
says
rolf
what
hast
thou
to
say
to
me
for
the
wounding
of
my
grani
looked
on
rolf
and
remembered
how
he
had
loved
him
once
and
loved
him
still
yet
never
might
they
be
friends
this
offer
will
i
make
said
grani
i
will
fare
abroad
and
never
come
back
to
trouble
thee
if
so
be
thou
wilt
give
my
father
while
he
lives
his
food
hast
thou
nothing
better
to
say
asked
rolf
i
will
make
this
offer
said
grani
i
will
be
thy
thrall
and
labor
for
thee
if
only
thou
wilt
maintain
my
father
out
of
thine
abundance
canst
thou
say
no
better
asked
rolf
again
grani
remembered
how
he
might
have
been
friends
with
rolf
and
would
not
and
how
he
should
have
asked
forgiveness
and
could
not
nothing
better
to
offer
have
i
said
he
nothing
worth
offering
for
he
despised
himself
and
thought
his
life
ended
illustration
grani
took
his
sword
and
his
shield
and
they
stood
up
to
fight
by
the
spring
take
then
thy
weapons
said
rolf
and
fight
me
here
on
the
level
space
by
the
spring
so
grani
took
his
sword
and
his
shield
and
they
stood
up
to
fight
by
the
spring
and
those
in
the
hut
heard
the
clash
of
steel
the
two
looked
strangely
fighting
grani
gaunt
and
ragged
and
rolf
well
fed
and
in
holiday
clothes
now
grani
thought
to
be
slain
quickly
but
rolf
seemed
to
have
no
power
at
first
yet
he
warmed
to
the
strife
and
began
to
strike
manfully
and
at
last
he
smote
away
a
part
of
grani
shield
then
grani
by
a
great
stroke
shore
away
the
half
of
rolf
shield
well
smitten
cried
rolf
and
they
fought
on
but
grani
found
himself
growing
weak
and
marvelled
much
that
rolf
smote
no
faster
but
if
he
means
to
tire
me
out
thought
grani
he
can
win
me
easily
then
rolf
drew
away
and
said
my
shoestrings
are
loose
i
will
tie
them
so
he
laid
aside
his
shield
and
sword
and
knelt
before
grani
to
tie
his
shoes
grani
might
have
slain
him
there
but
he
waited
and
not
to
be
tempted
to
that
treachery
grani
looked
about
he
saw
the
hut
where
were
his
father
and
sister
and
looked
off
on
the
firth
and
the
wide
land
and
waited
for
rolf
to
rise
then
they
fought
again
but
grani
grew
weary
and
desperate
and
his
thoughts
grew
hard
for
there
were
his
sister
and
father
close
at
hand
and
the
world
was
beautiful
and
while
they
fought
slowly
he
thought
that
cruel
so
to
prolong
death
since
for
rolf
he
was
no
match
at
all
he
wished
for
death
and
exposed
his
breast
to
rolf
strokes
and
cared
not
what
happened
but
rolf
drew
away
again
and
said
i
am
thirsty
and
knelt
down
by
the
spring
to
drink
then
in
his
great
weariness
grani
gave
way
to
an
evil
thought
and
cried
i
will
free
my
father
even
if
the
deed
be
foul
and
he
heaved
up
his
sword
to
slay
rolf
but
rolf
rose
upon
his
knees
looking
fair
in
grani
face
and
though
rolf
made
no
defence
grani
stayed
the
sword
in
midair
and
cast
it
far
away
then
he
sat
down
on
a
stone
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
rolf
rose
and
came
to
him
and
said
wherefore
didst
thou
not
slay
me
grani
answered
because
once
i
loved
thee
grani
grani
cried
rolf
has
thy
pride
at
last
come
to
its
end
now
once
more
i
ask
what
hast
thou
to
say
to
me
for
the
wounding
of
thy
henchmen
and
for
all
i
ever
did
to
thee
since
first
we
met
said
grani
only
this
i
beg
forgive
me
i
forgive
thee
rolf
cried
and
there
they
embraced
and
made
peace
this
is
the
end
of
the
tale
that
frodi
slept
yet
other
nights
at
cragness
than
that
one
and
lived
with
rolf
his
life
long
but
grani
took
his
father
home
to
fellstead
and
dwelt
there
he
and
einar
and
helga
grani
was
ever
the
greatest
friend
of
rolf
but
einar
never
came
into
rolf
sight
so
long
as
he
lived
and
that
was
not
long
for
the
old
man
was
broken
with
his
shame
then
after
that
rolf
took
to
wife
helga
the
sister
of
grani
and
the
curse
of
the
soursops
never
troubled
their
children
between
the
households
of
cragness
and
fellstead
was
ever
the
closest
bond
and
famous
men
are
come
