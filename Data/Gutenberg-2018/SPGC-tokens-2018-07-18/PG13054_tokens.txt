a
thane
of
wessex
being
a
story
of
the
great
viking
raids
into
somerset
by
charles
whistler
chapter
outlawed
the
whole
of
my
story
seems
to
me
to
begin
on
the
day
when
i
stood
closely
guarded
before
my
judges
in
the
great
circle
of
the
people
at
the
folk
moot
of
the
men
of
somerset
gathered
on
the
ancient
hill
of
brent
all
my
life
before
that
seems
to
have
been
as
nothing
so
quiet
and
uneventful
it
was
compared
to
what
came
after
i
had
grown
from
boyhood
to
manhood
in
my
father
great
hall
on
the
little
hill
of
cannington
that
looks
out
over
the
mouth
of
the
river
parret
to
the
blue
hills
beyond
and
there
when
i
was
but
and
long
motherless
i
succeeded
him
as
thane
and
tried
to
govern
my
people
as
well
and
wisely
as
he
that
i
too
might
die
loved
and
honoured
as
he
died
and
that
life
lasted
but
three
years
maybe
being
young
and
headstrong
i
spoke
at
times
when
the
feasting
was
over
and
the
ale
cup
went
round
too
boldly
of
the
things
that
were
beyond
me
and
dared
in
my
want
of
experience
to
criticize
the
ways
of
the
king
and
his
ordering
of
matters
thinking
at
the
same
time
no
thought
of
disloyalty
for
had
anyone
disparaged
the
king
to
myself
my
sword
would
have
been
out
to
chastise
the
speaker
in
a
moment
but
as
it
ever
is
what
seems
wrong
in
another
may
be
passed
over
in
oneself
however
that
may
be
it
came
to
pass
that
matelgar
the
thane
of
stert
a
rich
and
envious
man
saw
his
way
through
this
conceit
of
mine
to
his
own
profit
for
egbert
the
wise
king
was
but
a
few
years
dead
and
it
was
likely
enough
that
some
of
the
houses
of
the
old
seven
kings
might
dare
to
make
headway
against
ethelwulf
his
successor
and
for
a
time
the
words
of
men
were
watched
lest
an
insurrection
might
be
made
unawares
i
thought
nothing
of
this
nor
indeed
dreamt
that
such
a
thing
might
be
nor
did
one
ever
warn
me
my
father
and
this
matelgar
were
never
close
friends
the
open
nature
of
the
one
fitting
ill
with
the
close
and
grasping
ways
of
the
other
yet
when
matelgar
spoke
me
fair
at
the
of
my
father
funeral
and
thereafter
would
often
ride
over
and
sup
with
me
i
was
proud
to
think
in
my
foolishness
that
i
had
won
the
friendship
that
my
father
could
not
win
and
so
set
myself
even
above
him
from
whom
i
had
learnt
all
i
knew
of
wisdom
and
that
conceit
of
mine
was
my
downfall
for
matelgar
as
i
was
soon
to
find
out
encouraged
my
foolishness
and
moreover
brought
in
friends
and
bought
men
of
his
who
by
flattering
me
soon
made
themselves
my
boon
companions
treasuring
up
every
word
that
might
tell
against
me
when
things
were
ripe
then
at
last
one
day
as
i
feasted
after
hunting
the
red
deer
on
the
quantocks
my
steward
came
into
my
hall
announcing
messengers
from
the
king
they
followed
close
on
his
heels
and
i
who
had
seen
nothing
of
courts
wondered
that
so
many
armed
men
should
be
needed
in
a
peaceful
hall
and
yet
watched
them
as
one
watches
a
gay
show
till
some
fifty
men
of
the
king
household
lined
my
hall
and
fifty
more
blocked
the
doorway
my
people
watched
too
and
i
saw
a
smile
cross
from
one
of
matelgar
men
to
another
but
thought
no
guile
then
one
came
forward
and
arrested
me
in
the
king
name
as
a
traitor
and
i
drew
my
sword
on
him
telling
him
he
lied
in
giving
me
that
name
calling
too
on
my
men
to
aid
me
but
they
were
overmatched
and
dared
not
resist
for
the
swords
of
the
king
men
were
out
and
moreover
i
saw
that
matelgar
men
were
weaponless
he
himself
was
not
with
me
and
still
i
had
no
thought
of
treachery
so
the
end
was
that
i
was
pinioned
from
behind
and
bound
and
taken
away
that
night
to
where
i
knew
not
only
wherever
it
was
i
was
kept
in
darkness
and
chains
maddened
by
the
injustice
of
the
thing
and
my
own
helplessness
till
i
lost
count
of
days
and
at
last
hope
itself
and
all
that
time
the
real
reason
for
my
arrest
and
for
the
accusation
that
caused
it
never
entered
my
mind
and
least
of
all
did
i
suspect
that
matelgar
my
friend
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
indeed
i
hoped
at
first
that
hearing
of
my
trouble
he
would
interfere
and
procure
my
release
till
as
i
say
hope
was
gone
it
was
march
when
i
was
taken
to
prison
it
was
into
broad
may
sunshine
and
greenness
that
i
was
brought
out
by
my
surly
jailers
at
last
set
half
blind
with
the
darkness
of
the
prison
on
a
good
horse
and
so
with
my
hands
bound
behind
me
led
off
in
the
midst
of
a
strong
guard
to
the
place
of
my
trial
then
as
mind
and
feeling
came
back
to
me
with
the
fresh
air
and
springtime
warmth
i
knew
the
place
we
were
leaving
it
was
the
castle
of
a
friend
of
matelgar
and
that
seemed
strange
to
me
for
i
had
been
hardly
treated
seeing
none
save
the
men
who
fed
me
and
saw
that
my
chains
were
kept
secure
then
i
looked
in
the
faces
of
my
guards
but
all
were
unknown
to
me
as
i
had
not
before
been
to
that
castle
as
a
guest
i
was
not
surprised
and
i
said
nothing
to
them
for
i
had
found
the
uselessness
of
question
and
entreaty
when
i
spoke
at
the
first
to
the
jailers
so
silently
we
rode
on
and
the
world
looked
very
fair
to
me
after
the
long
grayness
of
the
prison
walls
one
who
knows
the
west
country
hunting
through
it
as
i
have
hunted
grows
to
love
and
recognize
the
changing
shapes
of
every
hill
and
coombe
and
spur
of
climbing
forest
on
their
sides
and
so
before
long
i
knew
we
were
making
for
the
great
hill
of
brent
but
why
i
could
not
tell
then
we
crossed
parret
river
and
i
watched
a
salmon
leap
as
we
did
so
and
then
on
over
the
level
marshes
till
i
could
see
that
the
wide
circle
on
brent
top
was
black
with
swarming
people
often
enough
as
the
cloud
shadows
passed
from
them
arms
and
bright
armour
sparkled
in
the
sunlight
among
the
crowd
and
then
i
could
have
wept
having
no
arms
or
harness
left
me
for
often
when
aforetime
i
rode
free
i
would
take
a
childish
pleasure
in
seeing
the
churls
blink
and
shade
their
eyes
as
i
flashed
on
them
and
would
wonder
too
if
my
weapons
shone
as
my
father
shone
as
we
rode
side
by
side
on
some
sunny
upland
then
when
we
came
under
the
hill
of
brent
the
hum
of
voices
came
down
to
us
for
the
day
was
still
and
my
guards
straightened
themselves
in
the
saddle
and
set
their
ranks
more
orderly
but
i
clad
as
i
was
in
the
rags
of
the
finery
i
had
worn
at
the
feast
whence
i
was
taken
shrank
within
myself
ashamed
to
meet
the
gazes
that
must
be
turned
on
me
presently
for
i
saw
that
we
were
going
on
up
the
steep
ascent
to
mix
with
the
crowd
on
the
summit
of
the
great
knoll
now
by
this
time
the
long
ride
had
brought
back
my
senses
to
me
and
i
began
to
take
more
thought
for
myself
and
what
might
be
meant
by
this
journey
at
first
i
had
been
so
stunned
and
dazed
by
the
release
as
my
removal
from
the
dungeon
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
been
content
to
feel
the
light
and
air
play
about
me
once
more
but
that
strangeness
had
worn
off
now
and
the
consciousness
of
being
yet
a
prisoner
took
hold
of
me
my
guards
had
ridden
silent
either
in
obedience
to
command
or
because
a
saxon
is
not
often
given
to
talk
when
under
some
responsibility
so
that
i
had
learnt
nothing
from
them
thus
far
but
as
we
turned
our
horses
heads
up
the
steep
a
longing
at
last
came
over
me
to
speak
and
i
turned
to
a
man
who
had
ridden
silently
at
my
right
hand
all
the
morning
and
asked
him
plainly
whither
he
was
taking
me
and
for
answer
he
pointed
up
the
hill
saying
nothing
then
i
asked
him
why
i
must
be
taken
there
and
grimly
enough
he
replied
in
two
words
for
trial
and
so
i
knew
that
the
great
moot
i
was
summoned
and
that
presently
i
should
know
the
whole
meaning
of
this
thing
that
had
befallen
me
then
my
spirits
began
to
rise
for
being
conscious
of
no
wrongdoing
i
looked
forward
to
speedy
release
with
full
proof
of
innocence
then
i
began
to
look
about
me
and
to
note
the
crowds
of
people
whom
the
moot
had
gathered
so
many
and
various
were
these
that
i
and
my
guards
passed
with
little
notice
among
those
who
toiled
up
the
hill
with
us
the
crowd
growing
thicker
as
we
neared
the
edge
of
the
first
great
square
platform
on
the
hilltop
and
when
we
reached
this
my
guards
reined
up
to
breathe
their
horses
for
brent
has
from
this
first
platform
a
yet
steeper
rise
to
the
ancient
circle
on
the
very
summit
men
say
that
both
platform
and
circle
are
the
work
of
the
welsh
whom
our
saxon
forefathers
drove
out
and
enslaved
but
however
this
may
be
they
were
no
idle
workmen
who
raised
the
great
earthworks
that
are
there
all
the
many
acres
of
that
great
platform
were
covered
with
wagons
and
carts
and
everywhere
were
set
booths
and
tents
and
in
them
men
and
women
were
eating
and
drinking
having
come
from
far
there
were
too
shows
of
every
kind
to
beguile
the
hours
of
waiting
or
to
tempt
the
curious
for
many
of
the
people
thralls
and
unfree
men
had
taken
holiday
with
their
masters
and
had
come
to
see
the
moot
though
they
had
no
part
in
the
business
thereof
so
there
were
many
tumblers
and
dancers
jugglers
and
gleemen
each
with
a
crowd
round
them
but
among
these
crowds
were
few
freemen
so
that
i
judged
that
the
moot
was
set
and
that
they
were
gathered
on
the
higher
circle
that
was
yet
before
us
to
be
climbed
i
had
been
on
brent
once
or
twice
before
but
then
it
had
been
deserted
and
my
eyes
had
had
time
and
inclination
to
look
out
over
the
wide
view
of
hill
and
plain
and
sea
and
distant
welsh
mountains
beyond
that
now
i
thought
nothing
of
these
things
but
looked
up
to
where
it
seemed
that
i
must
be
judged
i
could
make
out
one
or
two
banners
pitched
and
floating
idly
in
the
sunshine
and
one
seemed
to
have
a
golden
cross
at
its
stave
head
but
i
could
make
out
none
of
the
devices
on
them
and
so
i
looked
idly
back
on
the
crowd
again
and
then
men
brought
us
food
and
ale
and
at
last
after
some
gruff
talk
among
themselves
the
guards
untied
my
hands
though
they
left
my
feet
bound
under
the
saddle
girths
and
bade
me
help
myself
nor
was
i
loth
to
eat
heartily
with
the
freshness
of
the
ride
on
me
and
with
the
hope
of
freedom
strong
in
my
heart
then
we
waited
for
an
hour
or
more
and
the
sun
began
to
slope
westward
and
my
guards
seemed
to
grow
impatient
still
the
crowds
did
not
thin
and
if
one
group
of
performers
ceased
another
set
began
their
antics
at
last
a
messenger
came
towards
us
the
throng
making
hasty
way
for
him
and
spoke
to
the
leader
of
our
party
then
following
him
we
rode
to
the
foot
of
the
great
mound
and
there
dismounted
and
now
they
bound
my
hands
again
and
if
i
asked
them
to
forbear
i
can
not
well
remember
but
i
think
i
did
so
in
vain
for
my
mind
was
in
a
great
tumult
as
we
climbed
the
hill
wondering
and
fearing
and
hoping
all
at
once
and
longing
to
see
who
were
my
judges
and
to
have
this
matter
ended
once
for
all
we
passed
i
think
two
groups
coming
down
from
some
judgment
given
and
of
these
i
know
one
contained
a
guarded
and
ironed
man
with
a
white
set
face
and
the
other
was
made
up
of
people
who
smiled
and
talked
rapidly
leading
one
who
had
either
gained
a
cause
or
had
been
acquitted
there
were
perhaps
other
people
who
met
us
or
whom
we
passed
but
these
are
the
two
i
remember
of
them
all
then
we
gained
the
summit
and
stood
there
waiting
for
orders
as
it
seemed
and
i
could
look
round
on
all
the
ring
and
at
first
i
seemed
to
be
blinded
by
the
brilliance
of
that
assembly
for
our
saxon
folk
love
bright
array
and
fair
jewellery
on
arm
and
neck
men
sat
four
and
six
deep
all
round
the
great
circle
leaving
only
the
gap
where
we
should
enter
and
right
opposite
that
gap
seemed
the
place
of
honour
for
there
were
a
score
or
more
of
chairs
set
each
with
a
thane
thereon
and
in
the
midst
of
them
sat
those
behind
whom
the
banners
were
raised
near
us
at
this
end
of
the
circle
were
the
lesser
freemen
and
so
round
each
bend
of
the
ring
to
right
and
left
in
order
of
rank
till
those
thanes
were
reached
who
were
highest
before
those
stood
some
disputants
as
it
seemed
and
i
could
not
see
the
faces
of
the
seated
thanes
clearly
at
first
but
presently
i
knew
the
banners
they
were
those
of
eanulf
the
ealdorman
and
of
ealhstan
the
bishop
and
when
i
saw
the
first
i
feared
for
the
great
ealdorman
was
a
stern
and
pitiless
man
from
all
i
had
ever
heard
but
when
i
knew
that
banner
with
the
golden
cross
above
it
my
heart
was
lighter
for
all
men
loved
and
spoke
well
of
the
bishop
it
seemed
long
before
that
trial
was
over
but
at
last
the
men
ceased
speaking
and
the
thanes
seemed
to
take
counsel
upon
it
and
then
eanulf
pronounced
judgment
and
the
men
sat
down
in
their
places
in
the
ring
for
it
was
as
one
could
tell
some
civil
dispute
of
boundary
or
road
or
the
like
which
had
been
toward
then
there
was
a
silence
for
a
space
until
the
ealdorman
rose
and
spoke
loudly
for
all
the
great
ring
to
hear
there
is
one
more
case
this
day
that
must
come
before
this
moot
and
that
is
one
which
brings
shame
on
this
land
of
ours
that
one
from
among
the
men
of
somerset
should
speak
ill
of
ethelwulf
the
king
and
plot
against
him
is
not
to
be
borne
but
that
all
men
may
know
and
fear
the
doom
that
shall
be
to
such
an
one
he
has
been
brought
for
trial
by
the
moot
with
full
proof
of
his
guilt
in
this
matter
that
somerset
itself
as
it
were
should
pronounce
his
sentence
now
when
the
assembly
heard
that
a
murmur
went
round
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
of
surprise
mixed
with
wrath
and
i
myself
felt
the
same
for
the
moment
but
then
the
eyes
of
all
turned
in
a
flash
upon
me
and
i
remembered
the
accusation
that
had
been
brought
against
me
and
i
knew
that
it
was
i
of
whom
eanulf
spoke
then
shame
fell
on
me
to
give
place
at
once
to
anger
and
i
think
i
should
have
spoken
hotly
but
that
at
some
sign
from
the
ealdorman
my
guards
laid
hold
of
me
and
led
me
across
the
open
space
and
set
me
before
him
and
the
bishop
but
as
he
with
the
others
laid
hands
on
me
that
man
who
had
answered
me
when
i
asked
my
one
question
whispered
hastily
in
my
ear
be
silent
and
keep
cool
i
would
he
were
alive
now
but
that
might
not
be
and
i
knew
not
then
why
he
thus
spoke
unless
he
had
known
and
loved
my
father
so
i
stood
before
those
two
judges
and
looked
them
in
the
face
and
then
one
moved
uneasily
in
his
seat
to
their
left
and
my
eyes
were
drawn
to
him
it
was
matelgar
and
as
i
saw
him
i
smiled
for
i
thought
him
a
friend
at
least
but
he
looked
not
at
me
then
from
him
i
turned
to
seek
the
face
of
some
other
whom
i
might
know
and
i
saw
thanes
friends
of
my
father
whom
i
had
not
cared
to
seek
and
of
these
some
frowned
on
me
but
some
looked
pityingly
as
i
thought
though
it
was
but
for
a
moment
that
my
eyes
might
leave
the
faces
of
those
two
judges
before
me
now
were
it
not
that
when
i
go
over
what
followed
my
heart
still
rises
up
again
in
a
wrath
and
mad
bitterness
that
i
fain
would
feel
no
more
i
would
tell
all
of
that
trial
if
trial
one
could
call
it
where
there
was
none
to
speak
for
the
accused
and
every
word
was
against
him
and
in
that
trial
i
myself
took
little
part
by
word
or
motion
standing
there
and
listening
as
though
the
words
spoken
of
me
concerned
another
as
indeed
they
might
well
have
done
but
first
eanulf
spoke
to
me
bending
his
brows
as
he
did
so
and
frowning
on
me
heregar
son
of
herewulf
the
thane
you
are
accused
by
honourable
men
of
speaking
evil
of
our
lord
the
king
ethelwulf
what
answer
have
you
to
make
to
this
charge
and
moreover
you
are
further
charged
with
conspiring
against
him
can
you
answer
to
that
charge
then
i
was
about
to
make
loud
and
angry
denial
of
these
accusations
but
that
old
guard
of
mine
who
yet
held
my
shoulder
gripped
it
tightly
and
i
remembered
his
words
so
that
in
a
flash
it
came
to
me
that
an
innocent
man
need
but
deny
frankly
as
one
who
has
no
fear
and
i
looked
eanulf
in
the
face
and
answered
him
neither
of
these
charges
are
true
noble
eanulf
nor
know
i
why
they
are
brought
against
me
or
by
whom
let
them
speak
there
are
those
here
who
will
answer
for
my
loyalty
now
as
i
spoke
thus
quietly
eanulf
brows
relaxed
and
i
saw
too
that
the
bishop
looked
more
kindly
on
me
eanulf
spoke
again
know
you
not
by
whom
these
charges
are
brought
truly
i
know
not
lord
eanulf
i
answered
for
no
man
may
say
these
things
of
me
save
he
lies
have
you
enemies
he
asked
none
known
to
me
i
told
him
truthfully
for
i
had
as
my
father
lived
at
peace
with
all
then
is
the
testimony
of
those
against
you
the
heavier
said
the
ealdorman
and
with
that
he
turned
to
the
bishop
before
i
could
make
reply
and
they
spoke
together
for
a
while
in
latin
which
i
knew
not
so
i
looked
to
my
friend
matelgar
for
comfort
but
he
seemed
to
see
me
not
looking
away
elsewhere
and
i
thought
him
plainly
troubled
for
me
for
his
face
was
white
and
the
hand
on
which
his
chin
rested
was
turning
the
ends
of
his
beard
between
his
teeth
so
that
he
bit
it
as
i
had
seen
him
do
before
when
in
doubt
or
perplexity
as
i
watched
him
the
bishop
spoke
in
saxon
saying
that
it
would
be
well
to
call
the
accusers
first
and
hear
them
that
i
might
make
such
reply
as
was
possible
to
me
for
said
he
it
seems
to
me
that
this
heregar
speaks
truth
in
saying
that
he
knows
not
his
accusers
then
eanulf
bowed
gravely
and
all
the
circle
was
hushed
for
a
little
talk
had
murmured
round
as
these
two
spoke
in
private
and
now
i
will
forbear
lest
the
rage
and
shame
of
it
should
get
the
mastery
of
me
again
and
i
should
again
think
and
speak
things
for
which
as
once
before
at
the
bidding
of
the
man
i
love
best
on
earth
i
must
do
long
penance
if
that
may
avail
for
truly
i
forgave
once
and
i
would
not
recall
that
forgiveness
yet
i
must
tell
somewhat
eanulf
bade
the
accusers
stand
forward
and
give
their
evidence
and
slowly
and
as
it
were
unwillingly
rose
matelgar
my
friend
as
i
had
deemed
him
and
behind
him
a
score
of
those
friends
of
his
who
had
kept
me
company
for
long
days
on
moor
and
in
forest
and
had
feasted
in
my
hall
again
that
warning
grasp
on
my
shoulder
and
i
thought
that
surely
either
i
or
they
had
mistaken
the
summons
and
that
my
defenders
had
come
forward
then
as
in
a
dream
i
listened
to
words
that
i
will
not
recall
making
good
those
accusations
and
through
all
that
false
witness
there
seemed
to
me
to
run
as
it
were
a
thread
of
those
foolish
words
of
mine
that
had
and
meant
no
harm
but
on
which
were
now
built
mountains
of
seeming
proof
so
that
when
at
last
all
those
men
had
spoken
i
was
dumb
and
knew
that
i
had
no
defence
for
no
proof
of
loyalty
had
i
to
give
for
proof
had
never
been
required
of
me
and
a
man
may
live
a
quiet
life
and
yet
conspire
most
foully
as
my
accusers
went
back
to
their
seats
there
ran
a
murmur
among
the
folk
and
then
a
silence
fell
the
level
afternoon
sun
seemed
to
blaze
on
me
alone
while
to
me
the
air
seemed
thick
and
close
and
full
of
whispers
ealhstan
the
bishop
broke
the
silence
the
proof
is
weighty
and
matelgar
the
thane
is
an
honourable
man
he
said
sadly
enough
but
if
a
man
conspires
there
needs
must
be
one
other
at
least
in
the
plot
surely
we
have
heard
little
of
this
then
was
added
more
evidence
and
men
proved
lonely
journeys
of
mine
with
evasion
of
notice
thereof
and
disavowal
of
the
same
yet
i
thought
that
matelgar
the
thane
knew
of
my
love
for
alswythe
his
daughter
whom
i
would
meet
as
lovers
will
meet
unobserved
if
they
may
in
all
honour
yet
as
i
listened
it
was
of
these
meetings
they
spoke
saying
only
that
i
had
been
able
to
concord
whom
i
met
and
where
though
matelgar
must
have
known
it
when
that
was
finished
eanulf
bade
me
call
men
to
disprove
these
things
and
i
could
not
for
my
accusers
were
my
close
companions
and
of
alswythe
i
would
not
speak
and
i
must
fain
hold
my
peace
only
after
a
silence
i
could
forbear
no
longer
and
cried
will
none
speak
for
me
then
one
by
one
my
father
friends
rose
and
told
what
they
knew
of
my
boyhood
and
training
but
of
these
last
few
years
of
my
manhood
they
alas
for
my
own
folly
could
not
speak
what
they
might
they
did
and
my
heart
turned
to
them
in
gratitude
for
a
little
though
treachery
had
seemed
to
make
it
a
stone
within
me
they
ended
and
the
silence
came
again
it
seemed
long
and
weighed
on
me
like
a
thunderstorm
in
the
air
nor
should
i
have
started
had
the
whole
assembly
broken
into
one
thunderclap
of
hatred
of
me
but
instead
of
that
came
the
calm
voice
of
ealhstan
the
bishop
eanulf
and
freemen
of
somerset
there
is
one
who
witnesses
for
this
heregar
more
plainly
than
all
these
that
witness
is
himself
in
his
youth
and
inexperience
what
are
the
wild
words
a
boy
will
say
who
will
plot
against
a
mighty
king
with
a
boy
for
partner
what
weight
have
his
words
what
help
can
come
from
his
following
it
seems
to
me
that
matelgar
the
thane
and
these
friends
of
his
might
well
have
laughed
away
all
these
foolishnesses
rather
than
hoard
them
up
to
bring
before
this
solemn
council
this
too
i
hold
for
injustice
that
one
should
be
kept
in
ward
till
his
trial
unknowing
of
all
that
is
against
him
unhelped
by
the
counsel
of
any
freeman
and
unable
to
send
word
to
those
who
should
stand
by
him
at
his
trial
indeed
this
thing
must
be
righted
i
tell
you
before
england
is
a
free
land
at
that
there
went
a
sound
of
assent
round
the
moot
and
it
seems
to
me
looking
back
that
that
trial
of
mine
hard
as
it
was
to
bear
was
yet
the
beginning
of
good
to
all
the
land
by
reason
of
those
words
which
it
taught
the
bishop
to
say
and
which
found
an
abiding
place
in
the
hearts
of
the
honest
men
who
heard
so
that
in
these
days
of
alfred
our
wise
king
they
have
borne
fruit
then
eanulf
signed
to
my
guards
and
they
led
me
away
and
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
that
the
moot
might
speak
its
mind
on
me
there
my
guards
bade
me
sit
down
and
i
did
so
resting
head
on
hands
and
thinking
of
nought
as
it
seemed
to
me
until
suddenly
rose
up
hate
of
matelgar
and
of
eanulf
and
of
all
that
great
assembly
and
of
all
the
world
there
was
an
earthquake
once
when
i
was
but
a
boy
and
never
could
i
forget
how
it
was
as
though
all
things
one
had
deemed
solid
and
secure
had
suddenly
become
treacherous
as
severn
ooze
and
now
it
was
to
me
as
though
an
earthquake
had
shaken
my
thoughts
of
men
for
till
that
day
never
had
i
found
cause
to
distrust
anyone
who
was
friend
of
mine
now
could
i
trust
none
then
rose
up
in
my
mind
the
image
of
alswythe
fair
and
blue
eyed
and
brown
haired
smiling
at
me
as
she
was
wont
and
i
deemed
her
too
false
as
having
tricked
me
to
meet
her
that
this
might
come
upon
me
well
it
was
that
they
called
me
back
into
the
ring
to
hear
my
doom
for
such
thoughts
as
these
will
drive
a
man
to
madness
now
must
i
think
for
myself
again
and
meet
what
must
be
yet
i
would
look
at
no
man
as
i
went
towards
the
place
of
my
judges
and
stood
before
them
with
my
eyes
cast
down
for
i
was
beaten
and
cared
no
more
for
aught
eanulf
spoke
but
he
had
no
anger
in
his
voice
and
it
seemed
as
though
he
repeated
the
words
of
others
heregar
son
of
herewulf
he
said
these
things
have
been
brought
against
you
by
honourable
men
and
you
can
not
disprove
them
hardly
can
you
deny
them
they
may
not
be
passed
over
yet
for
the
sake
of
your
youth
and
for
the
pleading
of
ealhstan
our
bishop
your
doom
shall
be
lighter
than
some
think
fit
death
it
might
be
but
that
shall
not
pass
now
on
you
or
for
this
but
thane
you
may
be
no
longer
and
we
do
confirm
that
sentence
landless
also
you
must
be
as
unworthy
to
hold
it
outlaw
surely
must
he
be
who
plots
against
the
head
of
law
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
said
this
then
is
your
doom
outlawed
you
are
from
this
day
forward
but
wolf
head
ii
you
shall
not
be
none
in
all
wessex
shalt
harbour
you
or
aid
you
but
none
shall
you
harm
save
you
harm
them
go
hence
from
this
place
and
from
this
land
to
some
land
where
no
man
knows
you
and
so
shall
you
rest
again
now
had
i
not
been
blinded
with
rage
and
shame
i
might
have
seen
that
there
was
mercy
in
this
sentence
and
hope
also
for
i
had
seen
a
man
outlawed
once
and
given
a
day
start
like
some
wild
beast
in
which
to
fly
from
the
hand
of
every
man
that
would
seek
his
life
but
i
was
to
be
safe
from
such
harm
and
but
that
i
must
go
hence
i
was
not
to
be
hounded
forth
nor
was
my
shame
to
be
published
beyond
wessex
so
that
all
the
other
kingdoms
lay
open
and
safe
to
me
none
of
this
i
heeded
i
only
knew
that
my
enemies
had
got
the
mastery
and
that
ruin
was
upon
me
so
i
ground
my
teeth
and
was
mute
then
they
cut
my
bonds
and
i
stood
free
but
cared
not
nor
did
i
stir
from
my
place
and
a
look
of
surprise
crossed
eanulf
face
but
ealhstan
the
bishop
knowing
well
i
think
what
was
in
my
mind
rose
from
his
seat
and
came
to
me
laying
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
i
would
have
shaken
them
off
but
be
kept
them
there
gently
and
spoke
to
me
heregar
my
son
he
said
and
his
words
were
like
the
cool
of
a
shower
after
heat
to
my
burning
brain
be
not
cast
down
in
the
day
of
your
trouble
overmuch
there
are
yet
things
for
you
to
do
in
this
world
of
ours
and
the
ways
of
men
are
not
all
alike
foolish
you
have
been
heregar
my
son
but
the
lord
who
gave
wisdom
to
solomon
the
youth
will
give
to
you
if
you
will
ask
him
go
your
way
in
peace
and
if
you
will
heed
my
words
take
your
trouble
to
some
wise
man
of
god
and
so
be
led
by
his
counsel
and
heregar
and
here
the
bishop
voice
was
for
me
alone
if
you
need
forgiveness
forgive
if
there
is
aught
by
you
to
be
forgiven
then
i
knew
that
the
bishop
at
least
believed
in
my
innocence
and
my
hard
heart
bent
before
him
though
my
body
would
not
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
for
one
moment
and
so
left
me
one
of
my
father
old
friends
rose
up
and
said
ealdorman
he
is
unarmed
give
him
that
which
will
keep
him
from
wanton
attack
or
from
the
wolves
even
if
it
be
but
a
thrall
weapons
eanulf
signed
assent
on
that
they
gave
me
a
woodman
billhook
and
a
seax
iii
such
as
the
churls
wear
and
one
thrust
a
good
ash
quarterstaff
into
my
hands
then
my
guards
led
me
away
from
the
assembly
and
set
my
face
towards
the
downward
path
once
again
the
old
man
spoke
to
me
with
words
of
good
counsel
keep
up
heart
master
make
for
cornwall
and
turn
viking
with
the
next
danes
who
come
i
would
not
answer
him
but
walked
down
the
hill
a
little
then
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
overcame
me
and
i
turned
and
shaking
my
staff
up
at
the
hill
cursed
the
moot
deeply
so
i
went
an
outlaw
chapter
ii
the
fight
with
two
now
whither
i
went
for
the
next
two
hours
i
can
not
tell
for
my
mind
was
heedless
of
time
or
place
or
direction
only
full
of
burning
hate
of
all
men
and
of
matelgar
most
of
all
and
though
that
has
long
passed
away
from
me
so
that
i
may
even
think
of
him
now
as
the
pleasant
comrade
in
field
and
feast
that
he
once
was
i
wonder
not
at
all
i
then
felt
for
this
treachery
had
come
on
me
so
unawares
and
was
so
deep
wherever
it
was
i
wandered
it
took
me
away
from
men
and
at
last
when
i
roused
myself
to
a
knowledge
again
of
the
land
round
me
i
was
hard
on
the
borders
of
sedgemoor
waste
and
the
sun
was
low
down
and
near
setting
perhaps
i
had
not
roused
even
then
but
it
came
into
my
mind
that
i
was
followed
and
that
for
some
time
past
i
had
heard
as
in
a
dream
the
noise
of
footsteps
not
far
behind
me
now
since
i
was
in
the
glade
of
a
little
wood
a
snapping
stick
broke
the
dream
and
i
started
and
turned
where
i
stood
was
in
the
shadow
but
twenty
paces
from
me
a
red
level
sunbeam
came
past
the
tree
trunks
and
made
a
bright
patch
of
light
on
the
new
growing
grass
beneath
the
branches
and
even
as
i
turned
into
that
patch
of
light
came
two
of
matelgar
men
walking
swiftly
as
if
here
at
last
they
would
overtake
me
and
moreover
that
sunlight
lit
on
drawn
swords
in
their
hands
so
that
in
a
moment
i
knew
that
his
hate
followed
me
yet
and
that
for
him
the
moot
had
been
too
merciful
in
not
slaying
me
then
and
there
so
that
these
were
on
that
errand
for
him
then
all
earth
and
sky
grew
red
before
my
eyes
for
here
seemed
to
me
the
beginning
of
my
revenge
and
before
these
two
knew
that
i
had
turned
out
of
the
dim
shadow
i
leapt
upon
them
silent
with
that
quarterstaff
aloft
dazzled
they
were
with
the
sunlight
and
thinking
least
of
all
of
my
turning
thus
swiftly
if
at
all
and
i
was
as
one
of
the
berserks
of
whom
men
spoke
caring
not
for
death
if
only
i
might
slay
one
of
those
who
had
wrought
me
wrong
into
the
face
of
that
one
to
the
left
flew
the
end
of
the
heavy
staff
and
he
fell
and
as
the
other
gave
back
a
pace
i
whirled
it
round
to
strike
his
head
he
raised
his
sword
to
guard
the
blow
and
that
fell
in
shivers
as
i
smote
it
then
a
second
blow
laid
him
across
his
comrade
senseless
then
i
stood
over
them
and
rejoiced
and
part
of
my
anger
and
shame
seemed
to
pass
into
the
lust
of
revenge
begun
well
i
knew
the
men
as
two
of
matelgar
housecarles
and
that
made
it
the
sweeter
to
see
them
lie
thus
helpless
before
me
i
knew
not
if
they
were
dead
yet
but
i
would
make
sure
so
i
leaned
my
staff
against
a
tree
and
drew
the
sharp
seax
from
my
belt
then
came
into
my
mind
the
words
of
my
father
who
would
ever
tell
me
that
he
is
basest
who
would
slay
an
unarmed
foe
or
smite
a
fallen
man
and
hastily
i
put
back
the
seax
again
lest
i
should
be
tempted
to
become
base
as
men
had
said
i
was
for
i
hold
treachery
to
be
of
the
same
nature
as
that
of
which
my
father
warned
me
i
took
back
my
staff
and
leant
on
it
thinking
and
looking
at
those
men
they
were
the
first
i
had
ever
met
in
earnest
and
this
was
the
first
proof
of
the
skill
in
arms
my
father
had
spent
long
years
in
giving
me
so
there
crept
over
me
a
pride
that
i
had
met
two
and
overcome
them
and
i
unarmed
as
we
count
it
against
men
then
i
thought
that
herewulf
my
father
would
be
proud
of
me
could
he
see
this
and
then
instantly
the
shame
of
what
had
led
to
this
swallowed
up
all
my
pride
and
with
that
thought
of
my
father
loved
and
honoured
name
my
hard
heart
was
broken
and
i
leant
my
head
against
a
tree
and
wept
bitterly
one
of
the
men
stirred
and
i
sprang
round
hurriedly
it
was
the
second
man
whose
sword
i
had
broken
he
had
been
but
stunned
and
now
sat
up
as
one
barely
awake
and
unaware
of
what
had
happened
i
might
not
slay
him
now
but
quick
as
i
could
i
took
off
my
own
broad
leather
belt
and
pinioned
him
from
behind
he
was
yet
too
dazed
to
resist
and
then
i
took
his
dagger
from
him
and
bound
his
feet
with
his
own
belt
dragging
him
away
from
his
comrade
and
setting
him
against
a
tree
there
he
sat
blinking
at
me
but
becoming
more
himself
quickly
then
i
looked
at
the
other
man
he
was
dead
for
the
end
of
the
quarterstaff
had
driven
in
his
forehead
so
madly
had
i
struck
at
him
with
all
my
weight
and
now
seeing
that
i
was
cooler
and
might
think
more
clearly
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
bitter
to
matelgar
that
out
of
his
wish
to
destroy
me
should
come
help
to
myself
i
needed
arms
and
now
i
had
but
to
take
them
from
his
own
armoury
as
it
were
well
armed
were
all
his
housecarles
and
this
one
i
had
slain
was
their
captain
and
his
byrnie
of
linked
mail
was
of
the
best
sussex
steel
and
his
helm
was
crested
with
a
golden
boar
with
linked
mail
tippet
hanging
to
protect
the
neck
and
his
sword
but
as
my
eyes
fell
on
that
my
heart
gave
a
great
leap
of
joy
for
it
was
my
own
mine
too
was
the
baldric
from
which
it
hung
and
mine
was
the
seax
that
balanced
it
close
to
the
right
hand
in
the
belt
as
i
saw
that
i
began
to
know
more
of
the
plans
of
matelgar
for
it
must
be
that
my
hall
and
all
my
goods
had
fallen
into
his
hands
and
this
was
the
reward
his
head
man
had
asked
and
been
given
and
now
i
minded
that
this
man
had
been
one
of
those
who
gave
evidence
of
my
lonely
rides
and
secret
meetings
so
he
had
been
bought
thus
for
my
sword
was
a
good
one
and
the
hilt
curiously
wrought
in
ivory
and
silver
then
i
made
no
more
delay
but
stripped
the
man
of
his
armour
and
also
of
the
stout
leathern
jerkin
he
wore
beneath
it
for
i
was
clad
in
the
rags
of
feasting
garb
as
i
have
said
and
hated
them
even
as
i
threw
them
aside
the
man
was
of
my
own
height
and
build
as
it
chanced
and
his
gear
fitted
me
well
so
i
took
his
hide
shoes
also
casting
away
my
frayed
velvet
foot
coverings
into
the
underwood
now
once
more
i
stood
clad
in
the
arms
of
a
free
man
and
how
good
it
was
to
feel
again
the
well
known
and
loved
weight
of
mail
and
helm
and
sword
tugging
at
me
i
can
not
say
but
this
i
know
that
like
the
strong
man
of
old
our
old
priest
told
me
of
as
i
shook
myself
my
strength
and
manhood
came
back
to
me
but
now
whereas
i
had
been
haled
from
my
feasting
a
careless
boy
and
had
stood
before
my
judges
as
an
angry
man
as
i
look
back
i
see
that
from
that
arming
i
rose
up
a
grim
and
desperate
warrior
with
wrongs
to
right
and
the
will
and
strength
to
right
them
so
i
stood
for
a
little
and
the
savage
thoughts
that
went
through
my
mind
i
may
not
write
then
i
turned
to
my
captive
and
looked
at
him
though
i
thought
nothing
concerning
him
but
what
he
saw
written
in
my
face
as
it
glowered
on
him
from
under
the
helmet
bade
him
cry
aloud
to
me
to
spare
him
and
at
that
i
laughed
it
was
so
good
to
feel
that
this
enemy
of
mine
feared
me
at
that
laugh
and
it
sounded
not
like
my
own
even
to
myself
the
man
writhed
and
besought
me
again
for
mercy
but
i
had
no
mind
to
kill
him
and
a
thought
crossed
me
matelgar
bade
you
slay
me
i
said
that
i
know
tell
me
why
he
has
sought
my
life
and
i
will
spare
you
master
said
the
man
hastily
i
knew
not
whom
i
was
to
slay
matelgar
bade
me
follow
gurth
yonder
and
smite
whom
he
smote
it
would
have
mattered
not
you
would
have
slain
me
as
well
as
any
other
nay
master
the
man
said
earnestly
that
would
i
not
you
lie
i
answered
curtly
enough
like
master
like
man
tell
me
what
i
bade
you
truly
i
lie
not
heregar
cried
he
for
i
love
my
mistress
over
well
to
harm
you
now
at
that
mention
of
alswythe
the
blood
rushed
into
my
face
for
i
had
held
her
false
with
the
rest
and
this
seemed
to
say
otherwise
unless
the
plot
had
been
hidden
from
such
as
this
man
but
i
would
fain
learn
more
of
that
for
the
sake
of
the
hope
of
a
love
i
had
thought
true
what
is
your
mistress
to
me
i
asked
ye
are
all
alike
i
think
the
man
could
see
well
at
what
i
aimed
for
he
spoke
of
the
lady
alswythe
more
freely
than
he
would
have
dared
at
other
times
nor
would
i
have
let
him
name
her
lightly
our
mistress
has
gone
sadly
since
the
day
you
were
taken
master
even
asking
me
to
tell
her
if
i
could
where
you
were
kept
thinking
me
one
of
those
who
guarded
you
mayhap
but
i
knew
not
till
today
what
had
chanced
to
you
men
may
know
well
from
such
tokens
what
is
amiss
hearing
that
my
heart
lightened
within
me
for
i
saw
that
the
man
spoke
truth
however
i
would
not
speak
more
of
this
to
such
as
he
and
i
bade
him
cease
his
prating
and
answer
plainly
my
first
question
laying
my
hand
on
my
seax
as
if
to
draw
it
gurth
could
have
told
you
master
he
cried
but
he
is
dead
matelgar
held
no
counsel
with
me
i
can
but
tell
you
what
the
talk
is
among
the
men
tell
it
because
matelgar
had
taken
charge
as
he
said
of
your
lands
while
you
were
away
and
knowing
well
that
in
your
taking
he
had
had
some
hand
men
say
it
is
to
get
possession
thereof
and
the
women
say
that
while
you
were
near
the
lady
alswythe
would
marry
no
other
so
that
he
had
had
you
removed
the
first
i
had
guessed
by
the
token
of
the
sword
that
i
had
regained
that
last
was
sweet
to
hear
go
on
i
said
how
came
matelgar
to
have
power
to
hold
my
lands
there
came
one
from
the
king
after
you
were
taken
giving
him
papers
with
a
great
seal
thereon
and
these
he
read
aloud
in
your
hall
showing
the
king
own
hand
at
the
end
so
men
bowed
thereto
and
all
your
men
he
drove
out
if
they
would
not
serve
him
and
few
remained
the
rest
have
taken
service
elsewhere
if
they
were
free
so
matelgar
was
in
possession
and
now
would
be
confirmed
in
the
same
what
mattered
that
to
an
outlaw
but
i
could
have
borne
anything
better
than
to
think
of
him
sitting
in
my
place
as
reward
for
his
treachery
this
was
evidence
of
weakness
however
in
his
case
that
he
should
have
tried
to
have
me
slain
now
i
had
learnt
all
i
needed
and
more
in
the
one
thing
next
my
heart
than
i
hoped
if
that
were
true
for
still
i
could
not
but
doubt
the
faith
of
all
only
one
thing
more
i
would
ask
and
that
was
if
matelgar
bided
in
his
own
or
my
hall
the
man
told
me
that
he
kept
in
his
own
place
now
said
i
i
had
a
mind
to
leave
you
bound
here
for
the
wolves
but
you
shall
take
a
message
to
your
master
on
that
the
man
swore
to
do
my
bidding
or
if
i
would
to
follow
me
save
your
oaths
i
said
i
have
heard
a
many
today
and
i
hold
them
as
nothing
take
these
cast
rags
of
mine
and
bear
them
back
to
your
master
give
them
to
him
and
then
say
to
him
whatsoever
you
will
either
that
you
have
slain
me
and
these
are
the
tokens
but
that
gurth
was
by
me
slain
and
you
must
leave
him
and
his
arms
here
because
of
the
wolves
which
you
feared
or
else
you
can
tell
him
the
truth
as
it
has
happened
and
see
what
he
does
to
you
i
mind
how
he
hung
up
a
thrall
of
his
by
the
thumbs
once
for
two
days
he
will
surely
take
good
care
of
one
of
two
who
were
beaten
by
an
unarmed
man
but
i
think
the
lie
will
come
easiest
to
your
master
man
thus
spoke
i
bitterly
and
cut
the
belt
which
bound
the
man
arms
thinking
all
the
while
that
he
would
never
go
back
at
all
if
he
were
wise
but
he
said
he
would
go
back
and
tell
the
lie
and
i
laughed
at
him
it
was
dusk
now
and
though
i
feared
not
the
man
i
would
play
with
him
yet
a
little
longer
in
my
bitterness
so
i
bade
him
keep
still
and
stir
not
till
i
gave
him
leave
his
feet
were
yet
bound
and
he
would
need
an
to
loose
that
binding
telling
him
then
that
i
would
not
run
the
chance
of
his
falling
on
me
from
behind
i
took
his
dagger
and
the
seax
they
had
given
me
and
stuck
them
in
the
ground
a
full
hundred
yards
away
and
then
bade
him
when
i
was
out
of
sight
crawl
thither
as
best
he
might
and
so
loose
himself
the
poor
wretch
was
too
glad
to
be
spared
to
do
aught
but
repeat
that
he
would
do
my
errand
faithfully
and
thank
me
and
but
for
the
sort
of
madness
that
was
still
on
me
i
must
have
been
ashamed
to
torture
him
so
i
am
sorry
now
as
i
think
of
it
and
many
a
man
who
has
well
deserved
punishment
have
i
let
go
since
that
day
fearing
lest
that
old
cruelty
should
be
on
me
again
perhaps
then
i
turned
and
walked
away
and
even
as
i
passed
the
weapons
i
heard
the
low
howl
of
a
wolf
from
the
swamp
to
my
right
far
off
it
was
but
at
that
sound
the
man
cast
himself
on
hands
and
knees
and
began
to
crawl
in
all
haste
to
free
himself
then
i
laughed
again
and
plunging
deeper
into
the
wood
lost
sight
of
him
chapter
iii
by
bell
book
and
candle
i
had
never
been
into
sedgemoor
before
and
so
went
straight
on
as
i
could
only
turning
aside
from
swampy
places
while
the
light
lasted
then
i
must
wait
for
the
moon
to
rise
and
i
sat
me
down
under
an
old
thorn
tree
on
a
little
rise
where
i
could
see
about
me
i
had
come
out
of
the
woods
and
all
the
moor
was
open
to
the
west
and
south
so
far
as
i
could
see
i
knew
that
the
place
was
haunted
of
evil
spirits
and
shunned
at
night
time
by
all
but
now
i
was
not
afraid
of
them
or
indeed
of
anything
save
the
wolves
the
terror
of
the
man
i
had
left
had
put
that
fear
into
my
head
or
i
think
that
desperate
as
i
was
only
the
sound
of
a
pack
of
them
in
full
cry
would
have
warned
me
still
i
had
heard
no
more
since
that
one
howled
an
hour
ago
cold
mists
rose
from
the
marsh
and
in
them
i
could
see
lights
flitting
a
month
or
two
ago
i
should
have
feared
them
thinking
of
beowulf
son
of
hygelac
and
what
befell
him
and
his
comrades
from
the
marsh
fiends
grendel
and
his
dam
now
i
watched
them
and
half
longed
for
a
fight
like
beowulf
iv
at
last
the
moon
rose
behind
me
and
i
walked
on
once
a
vast
shape
rose
up
in
the
mist
and
walked
beside
me
and
i
half
drew
my
sword
on
it
but
that
too
drew
sword
and
i
knew
it
for
my
own
shadow
on
the
thick
vapour
then
a
sheet
of
water
stretched
out
almost
under
my
feet
and
thousands
of
wildfowl
rose
and
fled
noisily
to
fall
again
into
further
pools
with
splash
and
mighty
clatter
i
must
skirt
this
pool
and
so
came
presently
to
a
thicket
of
reeds
shoulder
high
and
out
of
these
rose
looking
larger
than
natural
in
the
moonlight
a
great
wild
boar
that
had
his
lair
there
and
stood
staring
at
me
before
he
too
made
off
grunting
as
he
went
so
i
went
on
aimless
the
night
was
full
of
sounds
but
whether
earthly
from
wildfowl
and
bittern
and
curlew
from
fox
and
badger
and
otter
or
from
the
evil
spirits
of
the
marsh
i
knew
not
nor
cared
for
now
the
long
imprisonment
and
the
day
terrible
doings
and
the
little
food
i
had
had
since
we
halted
on
the
hill
of
brent
all
began
to
get
hold
of
me
and
i
stumbled
on
as
a
man
in
a
bad
dream
but
nothing
harmed
or
offered
to
harm
me
only
when
some
root
or
twisted
tussock
of
grass
would
catch
my
foot
and
hinder
me
i
cursed
it
for
being
in
league
with
matelgar
tearing
my
way
fiercely
over
or
through
it
and
at
last
i
think
my
mind
wandered
then
i
saw
a
red
light
that
glowed
close
under
the
edge
of
some
thick
woodland
where
the
land
rose
and
that
drew
me
it
was
the
hut
of
a
charcoal
burner
and
the
light
came
from
the
kiln
close
by
which
was
open
and
the
man
himself
was
standing
at
it
even
now
taking
out
a
glowing
heap
of
the
coal
to
cool
before
he
piled
in
fresh
wood
and
closed
it
for
the
night
when
i
saw
the
hut
it
suddenly
came
on
me
that
i
was
wearied
out
and
must
sleep
and
so
went
thither
the
collier
heard
the
clank
of
my
armour
and
turned
round
in
the
crimson
light
of
the
glowing
coals
to
see
what
came
as
he
saw
me
standing
he
cried
aloud
in
terror
and
throwing
up
his
hands
fled
into
the
dark
beyond
the
kiln
calling
on
the
saints
to
protect
him
for
a
moment
i
wondered
that
he
should
thus
fly
me
but
i
staggered
to
his
hut
and
i
remember
seeing
his
bed
and
that
is
all
when
i
woke
again
at
first
i
thought
myself
back
in
the
dungeon
and
groaned
but
would
not
open
my
eyes
but
i
turned
uneasily
and
then
a
small
voice
spoke
saying
ho
grendel
are
you
awake
i
sat
up
and
looked
round
then
i
knew
where
i
was
but
i
had
slept
a
great
sleep
for
out
of
the
open
door
i
saw
the
quantock
hills
blue
across
the
moor
and
the
sun
shone
in
almost
level
it
was
late
afternoon
i
looked
for
him
who
had
spoken
and
at
first
could
see
no
one
for
the
sun
shone
in
my
face
but
something
stirred
in
a
corner
and
i
looked
there
it
was
a
small
sturdy
boy
of
some
ten
years
old
red
haired
and
freckled
all
over
where
his
woollen
jerkin
and
leather
hose
did
not
cover
him
he
sat
on
a
stool
and
stared
at
me
with
round
eyes
i
stared
back
at
him
for
a
minute
and
then
from
habit
for
i
would
always
play
with
children
made
a
wry
face
at
him
at
which
he
smiled
pleased
enough
and
said
spit
fire
good
grendel
i
want
to
see
now
i
was
glad
to
be
kept
off
my
own
fierce
thoughts
for
a
little
and
so
answered
him
back
wondering
at
the
name
he
gave
me
and
at
his
request
so
i
am
grendel
am
i
aye
said
the
urchin
dudda
collier
ran
into
village
in
the
night
saying
that
you
had
come
out
of
the
fen
all
fire
from
head
to
foot
and
so
he
fled
but
i
came
to
see
where
is
the
collier
then
he
dare
not
come
back
he
says
without
the
priest
and
has
gone
to
get
the
hermit
so
the
other
folk
bided
till
he
came
too
were
not
you
afraid
of
me
maybe
i
was
feared
at
first
but
i
would
see
you
spit
fire
before
the
holy
man
drives
you
away
so
i
looked
in
through
a
crack
and
saw
you
asleep
then
i
feared
not
and
bided
your
waking
for
a
little
time
what
is
your
name
brave
urchin
i
asked
for
i
was
pleased
with
the
child
and
his
fearlessness
turkil
he
said
well
turkil
i
am
not
grendel
he
fled
when
i
came
in
here
did
you
beat
him
asked
the
boy
with
a
sort
of
disappointment
nay
but
he
disappeared
when
the
hot
coals
went
out
i
said
and
now
i
am
hungry
can
you
find
me
aught
to
eat
and
indeed
rested
as
i
was
with
the
long
sleep
i
had
waked
sound
in
mind
and
body
again
and
longed
for
food
and
i
think
that
finding
this
strange
child
here
to
turn
my
thoughts
into
a
wholesome
channel
when
first
they
began
to
stir
in
me
was
a
mercy
that
i
must
ever
be
thankful
for
turkil
got
up
solemnly
and
went
to
the
hearth
thence
he
took
an
iron
cauldron
and
hoisted
it
on
the
great
round
of
tree
trunk
that
served
as
table
in
the
midst
of
the
hut
dudda
collier
left
his
supper
when
he
fled
wherefore
if
we
eat
it
he
will
think
grendel
got
it
and
no
blame
to
us
remarked
the
boy
chuckling
and
when
i
thought
how
i
had
not
a
copper
sceatta
left
me
in
the
world
i
stopped
before
saying
that
i
would
pay
him
when
he
returned
and
so
laughed
back
at
the
boy
and
fell
to
when
we
had
finished
the
cauldron
which
had
been
full
of
roe
deer
venison
was
empty
and
turkil
and
i
laughed
at
one
another
over
it
grendel
or
no
grendel
said
the
urchin
dudda
will
ask
nought
of
his
supper
why
not
by
reason
of
what
it
was
made
of
then
i
remembered
that
a
thrall
might
by
no
means
slay
the
deer
and
that
he
would
surely
be
in
fear
when
he
knew
that
one
had
found
him
out
so
i
said
to
the
boy
grendel
ate
it
doubtless
nor
you
nor
i
know
what
was
in
the
honest
man
pot
turkil
was
ready
to
meet
me
in
this
matter
and
looking
roguishly
at
me
gathered
up
the
bones
and
put
them
into
the
kilns
now
must
i
go
home
he
said
when
this
was
done
or
i
shall
be
beaten
but
i
would
i
had
seen
grendel
though
i
love
warriors
armed
like
you
verily
turkil
my
friend
said
i
a
stout
warrior
will
you
be
if
you
go
on
as
you
have
begun
thereupon
something
stirred
within
me
as
it
were
and
i
took
the
urchin
and
kissed
him
for
i
had
never
thought
to
call
one
friend
again
then
i
feared
to
let
him
go
from
me
lest
the
thoughts
of
yesterday
should
come
back
as
i
knew
they
would
did
i
give
way
to
them
so
i
told
him
to
bide
here
with
me
till
the
village
people
came
to
drive
away
grendel
and
that
i
would
make
all
right
for
him
then
we
went
out
of
the
little
hut
and
sat
on
the
logs
of
timber
and
he
told
me
tales
of
the
wood
and
stream
and
meres
to
which
i
must
answer
now
and
then
while
i
pondered
over
what
i
must
do
and
where
betake
myself
my
outlawry
would
not
be
known
till
the
people
had
got
home
from
brent
and
then
but
by
hearsay
till
the
sheriff
men
had
proclaimed
me
in
the
townships
this
place
too
where
a
man
could
slay
roe
deer
fearless
of
discovery
must
be
far
from
notice
and
i
would
bide
here
this
next
night
and
so
make
my
plans
well
and
grow
fully
rested
but
always
whatever
i
thought
was
revenge
on
matelgar
uppermost
now
turkil
would
see
my
sword
and
then
my
seax
and
try
my
helm
on
his
head
laughing
when
it
covered
his
eyes
and
i
had
almost
bade
him
come
to
my
hall
at
cannington
and
there
try
the
little
weapons
i
had
when
i
was
his
size
so
much
his
ways
took
from
me
the
thought
of
my
trouble
but
that
slip
brought
it
all
back
again
and
for
a
time
i
waxed
moody
so
that
the
child
was
silent
finding
no
answer
to
his
prattle
and
at
last
leant
against
me
and
slept
presently
i
leaned
back
and
slept
too
in
the
warm
sun
i
woke
with
the
sound
of
chanting
in
my
ears
and
the
ringing
of
a
little
bell
somewhere
in
the
wood
but
turkil
slept
on
and
i
would
not
stir
to
wake
him
sitting
still
and
wondering
then
out
of
the
wood
came
towards
the
hut
a
little
procession
and
when
i
saw
it
i
knew
that
i
as
grendel
was
to
be
exorcised
but
though
i
thought
not
of
it
exorcism
there
had
been
already
and
that
of
my
evil
spirit
of
yesterday
by
the
fearless
hand
of
a
little
child
there
came
first
an
old
priest
fully
vested
bearing
a
great
service
book
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
crucifix
and
reading
as
he
went
but
in
latin
so
that
i
could
not
know
what
he
read
and
on
either
side
of
him
were
two
youths
also
vested
one
bearing
a
great
candle
that
flared
and
guttered
in
the
wind
and
the
other
a
bell
which
now
and
then
he
rang
when
the
old
priest
ceased
reading
between
the
verses
after
these
came
the
villagers
i
saw
the
collier
among
the
first
and
his
knees
shook
as
he
walked
then
some
of
the
men
were
armed
with
bills
and
short
swords
and
a
few
with
bows
all
i
think
had
staves
after
them
came
some
women
and
i
saw
one
who
wept
looking
about
her
eagerly
they
did
not
see
me
for
the
timber
pile
was
next
the
kiln
and
a
little
behind
it
so
that
before
they
got
near
i
was
shut
out
from
view
for
a
time
while
they
were
thus
hidden
from
me
they
stopped
and
began
to
chant
again
priest
and
people
in
turn
after
that
had
gone
on
for
a
little
time
turkil
woke
and
sat
up
but
i
bade
him
in
a
whisper
to
be
silent
and
putting
his
finger
in
his
mouth
he
obeyed
wide
eyed
then
the
little
bell
gave
a
note
or
two
and
the
reading
began
so
near
that
i
could
hear
the
words
or
seem
to
remember
them
as
i
know
now
what
they
were
adjuro
te
maleficum
grendel
vocatum
diabolum
so
far
had
the
priest
got
when
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
house
and
i
stood
up
there
came
a
shout
from
the
men
and
the
exorcism
went
no
further
for
the
old
priest
saw
at
once
as
it
seemed
that
i
was
but
a
mortal
not
so
some
of
his
train
for
several
turned
to
fly
sorely
fearing
that
the
wrestle
between
the
powers
spiritual
had
begun
and
as
one
might
think
lacking
faith
in
their
own
side
for
they
showed
little
but
grendel
or
no
grendel
there
was
one
who
thought
not
of
her
own
safety
that
woman
whom
i
had
seen
weeping
gave
a
great
cry
and
rushed
at
me
seizing
my
little
comrade
from
my
arms
for
i
had
lifted
him
as
i
stood
and
covering
him
with
kisses
chided
him
and
petted
at
the
same
time
it
was
his
mother
who
hearing
that
her
darling
had
wandered
away
from
his
playmates
with
the
intention
of
seeing
grendel
as
he
avowed
had
dared
to
join
the
rest
to
learn
what
had
been
his
end
the
old
priest
looked
on
this
with
something
of
a
smile
and
then
turned
to
his
people
saying
doubtless
the
fiend
has
fled
or
this
warrior
and
the
child
had
not
been
here
search
my
children
and
see
if
there
be
traces
left
of
his
presence
and
i
will
speak
to
the
stranger
they
scattered
about
the
place
in
groups
for
they
yet
feared
to
be
alone
and
the
priest
came
up
to
me
scanning
my
arms
as
he
did
so
to
guess
my
rank
my
handsome
sword
and
belt
seemed
to
decide
him
for
though
the
armour
and
helm
were
plain
they
were
good
enough
for
any
thane
who
meant
them
for
hard
wear
and
not
for
show
sir
he
said
very
courteously
but
without
any
servility
i
see
you
are
a
stranger
and
you
meet
me
on
a
strange
errand
i
am
the
priest
whom
they
call
the
hermit
leofwine
should
i
name
you
thane
i
was
going
to
answer
him
as
i
would
have
replied
but
yesterday
morning
so
hesitated
a
little
and
then
answered
shortly
no
thane
father
but
the
next
thing
to
it
a
masterless
man
as
you
will
sir
he
replied
thinking
that
i
doubtless
had
my
own
reason
for
withholding
whatever
rank
i
had
we
meet
few
strangers
in
this
wild
i
lost
my
way
father
i
said
and
wandered
here
in
the
night
and
being
sorely
weary
slept
in
this
empty
hut
till
two
hours
ago
waking
to
find
yon
child
here
now
little
turkil
seeing
that
i
looked
towards
him
got
free
from
his
mother
and
ran
to
me
saying
that
he
must
go
home
and
that
i
must
speak
for
him
as
his
mother
was
wroth
with
him
for
playing
truant
the
woman
who
seemed
to
be
the
wife
of
some
freeman
followed
him
and
i
spoke
to
her
begging
her
to
forgive
the
boy
as
he
had
been
a
pleasant
comrade
to
me
and
that
indeed
i
had
kept
him
as
he
said
some
folk
were
coming
from
the
village
whereon
she
thanked
me
for
tending
him
saying
that
she
had
feared
the
foul
fiend
whom
the
collier
had
seen
would
surely
have
devoured
him
so
i
pleased
her
by
saying
that
a
boy
who
would
face
such
a
monster
now
would
surely
grow
up
a
valiant
man
then
turkil
must
kiss
me
in
going
bidding
me
come
and
see
him
again
and
i
knew
not
how
to
escape
promising
that
though
it
was
a
poor
promise
that
could
not
be
kept
seeing
that
i
must
fly
the
kingdom
of
wessex
as
soon
as
i
might
then
his
mother
took
him
away
he
looking
back
often
at
me
with
them
went
the
most
of
the
people
some
wondering
but
the
greater
part
laughing
at
dudda
collier
fright
i
asked
the
old
priest
where
the
village
might
be
and
he
told
me
that
it
lay
in
a
clearing
full
two
miles
off
and
that
the
father
of
turkil
was
the
chief
franklin
there
though
of
little
account
elsewhere
he
had
not
yet
come
back
from
the
great
moot
at
brent
and
that
was
good
hearing
for
me
for
though
he
must
return
next
day
i
should
be
far
by
that
time
while
we
talked
the
collier
and
two
or
three
men
came
to
us
telling
excitedly
how
that
the
kiln
was
raked
out
and
that
the
cauldron
was
empty
doubtless
the
work
of
the
fiend
saw
you
aught
of
any
fiend
good
sir
asked
the
priest
of
me
now
i
remembered
the
roe
deer
in
time
and
answered
i
saw
nought
worse
than
myself
but
i
think
that
had
the
collier
known
my
thoughts
he
would
have
fled
me
as
he
fled
that
he
took
me
for
but
that
he
was
sore
terrified
i
have
no
doubt
for
it
seemed
that
he
neither
recognized
me
nor
remembered
what
he
was
doing
at
the
kiln
when
i
came
maybe
as
often
happens
he
had
told
some
wild
story
to
so
many
that
he
believed
it
himself
then
my
sons
said
the
hermit
the
fiend
finding
dudda
no
prey
of
his
departed
straightway
and
he
need
fear
no
more
however
they
would
have
him
sprinkle
all
the
place
with
holy
water
repeating
the
proper
prayers
the
while
which
he
did
willingly
knowing
the
fears
of
his
people
and
gladly
trying
to
put
them
to
rest
then
the
collier
begged
one
after
another
to
bide
with
him
that
night
but
all
refused
having
other
things
to
be
done
which
they
said
might
not
he
foregone
it
was
plain
that
they
dared
not
stay
but
this
seemed
to
be
my
chance
the
men
had
many
times
looked
hard
at
me
but
as
i
was
speaking
with
the
priest
dared
not
question
me
as
they
would
so
having
seen
this
i
said
i
am
a
stranger
from
beyond
the
mendips
and
lost
my
way
last
night
coming
back
from
brent
glad
should
i
be
of
lodging
here
tonight
and
guidance
on
the
morrow
for
it
is
over
late
for
me
to
be
on
my
way
now
that
pleased
the
collier
well
enough
and
he
said
he
would
take
me
in
and
guide
me
where
i
would
go
next
day
the
other
men
wanted
to
ask
me
news
of
the
moot
but
i
put
them
off
saying
that
i
had
not
sat
thereon
but
had
passed
there
on
my
way
from
sherborne
so
they
were
content
and
asking
the
hermit
for
his
blessing
they
went
their
way
then
the
old
priest
took
off
the
vestments
which
were
over
his
brown
hermit
garb
and
giving
them
to
the
youths
who
had
acted
as
his
acolytes
bade
them
depart
also
having
given
them
some
directions
and
so
we
three
the
hermit
collier
and
myself
were
left
alone
by
the
hut
the
hermit
bade
the
collier
leave
us
and
he
evidently
holding
the
old
man
in
high
veneration
bowed
awkwardly
and
went
to
fill
and
relight
his
kiln
fires
and
then
the
old
priest
spoke
to
me
sir
i
was
brought
here
as
you
see
to
drive
away
an
evil
spirit
which
this
poor
thrall
said
had
appeared
to
him
last
night
and
from
which
he
fled
now
all
men
know
that
these
fens
are
haunted
by
fiends
even
as
holy
guthlac
found
in
the
land
of
the
gyrwa
v
being
sorely
troubled
by
them
but
i
have
seen
none
though
i
dwell
in
this
fen
much
as
he
dwelt
though
none
so
worthy
or
maybe
worth
troubling
as
he
know
you
what
he
saw
for
i
seem
to
see
that
your
coming
has
to
do
with
this
and
the
old
man
smiled
a
little
then
i
told
him
how
i
had
come
unexpectedly
into
the
firelight
and
that
the
man
had
fled
adding
that
i
was
nigh
worn
out
and
so
finding
a
resting
place
slept
without
heeding
him
and
then
how
little
turkil
had
called
me
grendel
bidding
me
spit
fire
for
him
to
see
at
that
the
old
man
laughed
a
hearty
laugh
looking
sidewise
to
see
that
dudda
was
at
work
and
unheeding
verily
he
said
it
is
as
i
deemed
but
with
more
reason
for
the
collier
to
fly
than
i
had
thought
for
truly
men
are
never
seen
here
and
thy
face
my
son
is
of
the
grimmest
for
all
you
are
so
young
i
marvel
turkil
feared
you
not
but
children
see
below
the
outward
mask
of
a
man
face
now
as
he
said
that
the
old
man
looked
kindly
but
searchingly
at
me
and
i
rebelled
against
it
but
he
was
so
saintly
looking
that
i
might
not
be
angry
so
tried
to
turn
it
off
turkil
the
valiant
called
me
grendel
father
also
i
think
you
came
out
to
exorcise
the
same
by
name
for
i
heard
it
in
the
latin
but
that
was
a
heathen
fiend
the
hermit
sighed
a
little
and
answered
me
they
sing
the
song
of
beowulf
and
love
it
heathen
though
it
be
better
than
aught
else
and
will
till
one
rises
up
who
will
turn
holy
writ
into
their
mother
tongue
as
caedmon
did
for
northumbria
howbeit
doubtless
those
who
were
fiends
in
the
days
of
the
false
gods
are
fiends
yet
and
if
grendel
then
so
also
grendel
now
though
he
may
have
many
other
names
and
knowing
that
name
from
their
songs
small
wonder
that
the
terror
that
came
from
the
marsh
must
needs
be
he
and
no
doubt
went
on
the
good
priest
though
with
a
little
twinkle
in
his
eye
he
knew
well
enough
whom
i
came
to
exorcise
even
if
the
name
were
wrong
had
he
indeed
been
visibly
here
so
he
spoke
but
my
mind
was
wandering
away
to
my
own
trouble
and
when
i
spoke
of
sherborne
just
now
the
thought
of
bishop
ealhstan
and
his
words
had
come
to
me
and
i
wondered
if
i
would
tell
my
troubles
to
this
old
man
as
he
bade
me
but
though
to
think
of
it
showed
that
i
was
again
more
myself
something
of
yesterday
bitterness
rose
up
again
as
the
scene
at
the
moot
came
back
and
i
would
not
the
priest
was
silent
for
a
while
and
must
have
watched
my
face
as
these
thoughts
hardened
it
again
be
not
wroth
with
an
old
man
my
son
he
said
very
gently
but
there
is
some
trouble
on
your
mind
as
one
who
has
watched
the
faces
of
men
as
long
as
i
may
well
see
and
it
is
bitter
trouble
i
fear
sometimes
these
troubles
pass
a
little
by
being
told
the
kind
words
softened
me
somewhat
and
i
answered
him
quietly
aye
father
there
is
trouble
but
not
to
be
told
i
will
take
myself
and
it
away
in
the
morning
and
so
bear
it
by
myself
he
looked
wistfully
at
me
as
one
who
fain
would
help
another
saying
other
men
troubles
press
lightly
on
such
as
i
my
son
save
that
they
add
to
my
prayers
and
i
was
to
tell
him
all
and
seek
his
counsel
but
i
would
not
still
i
would
answer
him
and
so
feigning
cheerfulness
said
one
trouble
father
i
fear
you
can
not
help
me
in
i
have
nought
wherewith
to
reward
this
honest
man
for
lodging
and
guidance
nor
for
playing
grendel
on
him
and
eating
his
food
to
boot
surely
you
have
honest
hands
by
whom
to
send
him
somewhat
or
he
will
lead
you
to
friends
who
will
willingly
lend
to
you
and
i
had
neither
i
who
but
a
few
weeks
ago
could
have
commanded
both
by
scores
and
now
none
might
aid
me
none
might
call
me
friend
i
was
alone
these
words
brought
it
home
to
me
more
clearly
than
before
and
the
loneliness
of
it
sank
into
my
heart
and
my
pride
fled
and
i
told
the
good
man
all
looking
to
see
him
shrink
from
me
but
he
did
not
hearing
me
patiently
to
the
end
i
think
if
he
had
shrunk
from
me
the
telling
had
left
me
worse
than
when
i
kept
it
hid
from
him
when
i
ended
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
even
as
the
bishop
had
laid
his
and
said
vengeance
is
mine
i
will
repay
saith
the
lord
and
i
who
had
never
heard
those
words
before
thought
them
a
promise
sent
by
the
mouth
of
this
prophet
as
it
were
to
me
and
wondered
then
he
went
on
surely
my
son
i
believe
you
to
be
true
and
that
you
suffer
wrongfully
for
never
one
who
would
lie
told
the
evil
of
himself
as
you
have
told
me
foolish
you
have
been
indeed
as
is
the
way
of
youth
but
disloyal
you
were
not
i
was
silent
and
waited
for
him
to
speak
such
words
again
and
he
too
was
silent
for
a
little
looking
out
over
the
marsh
and
rocking
himself
to
and
fro
as
he
sat
on
the
tree
trunk
beside
me
watching
and
praying
and
fasting
alone
there
has
been
given
me
some
little
gift
of
prophecy
my
son
now
and
then
it
comes
but
never
with
light
cause
and
now
i
will
say
what
is
given
me
to
say
cast
out
you
are
from
the
wessex
land
but
before
long
wessex
shall
be
beholden
to
you
not
long
shall
matelgar
the
treacherous
hold
your
place
but
you
shall
be
in
honour
again
of
all
men
only
must
you
forego
your
vengeance
and
leave
that
to
the
hand
of
the
lord
who
repays
what
must
i
do
now
father
i
asked
in
a
low
voice
go
your
own
way
my
son
and
as
you
were
bidden
depart
from
this
kingdom
as
you
will
and
whither
and
what
shall
be
shall
be
fighting
there
is
for
you
both
within
and
without
but
the
battle
within
will
be
the
sorest
for
i
know
that
the
longing
for
revenge
will
abide
with
you
and
that
is
hard
to
overcome
yet
remember
the
message
of
forbearance
then
i
cried
out
that
i
must
surely
be
revenged
and
the
good
man
strove
with
me
with
many
and
sweet
words
till
he
had
quieted
the
thought
within
me
again
yet
i
longed
for
it
so
we
talked
till
the
sun
sank
and
he
must
go
ere
darkness
fell
but
at
last
he
bade
me
kneel
and
i
knelt
who
had
thought
in
my
pride
never
to
humble
myself
before
mortal
man
again
till
one
dealt
me
my
death
blow
and
i
needs
must
fall
before
him
so
he
blessed
me
and
departed
bidding
me
remember
that
at
sunrise
and
midday
and
sunset
leofwine
the
priest
and
turkil
the
child
should
remember
me
in
their
prayers
and
for
he
was
very
thoughtful
he
told
me
that
he
would
take
such
order
with
the
collier
that
he
would
ask
nought
from
me
nor
must
i
offer
him
anything
save
thanks
and
he
spoke
to
him
in
going
i
watched
him
go
till
i
could
see
him
no
more
and
then
calling
my
host
supped
with
him
and
slept
peacefully
till
the
first
morning
light
chapter
iv
the
secret
meeting
i
woke
before
the
collier
who
slept
across
the
doorway
on
some
skins
and
lay
in
his
sleeping
place
for
half
an
hour
thinking
of
what
should
be
before
me
and
whither
i
would
go
this
day
and
thinking
quietly
enough
now
i
made
the
resolve
to
leave
at
all
events
my
revenge
that
i
had
so
longed
for
to
sleep
for
a
while
for
the
words
of
the
good
priest
had
bided
with
me
and
moreover
i
had
some
hope
from
his
words
of
prophecy
so
i
would
see
how
that
turned
out
and
then
if
nought
came
of
it
i
would
turn
to
my
revenge
again
so
having
got
thus
far
the
advice
of
the
warrior
seemed
as
good
as
any
for
it
was
easy
to
me
to
get
into
west
wales
and
then
take
service
with
the
until
such
time
as
danish
or
norse
vikings
put
in
thither
as
they
would
at
times
for
provender
or
to
buy
copper
and
tin
from
the
miners
but
then
a
great
longing
came
over
me
to
see
alswythe
once
more
and
learn
the
truth
of
her
faith
or
falseness
the
man
i
had
bound
seemed
to
speak
truth
though
she
was
the
daughter
of
matelgar
yet
if
she
were
child
of
that
false
man
i
had
known
her
mother
well
and
loved
her
until
she
died
a
year
ago
and
she
was
a
noble
lady
and
full
of
honesty
now
as
safe
a
way
as
any
into
the
westland
would
be
over
the
quantocks
and
so
into
the
wilds
of
dartmoor
and
beyond
where
no
man
would
know
or
care
for
my
outlawry
if
indeed
i
found
not
more
proscribed
men
there
than
anywhere
who
had
fled
as
i
must
fly
but
with
a
price
on
them
and
if
i
fled
that
way
it
was
but
a
step
aside
to
pass
close
to
matelgar
hall
it
was
the
least
safe
path
for
me
it
is
true
for
i
had
had
a
taste
of
what
sort
of
reception
i
should
meet
with
at
his
hands
did
he
catch
me
or
meet
with
me
but
love
drew
me
and
i
would
venture
and
see
at
least
the
place
where
the
one
i
loved
dwelt
having
made
up
my
mind
to
that
i
was
all
impatience
to
be
going
and
woke
the
collier
saying
that
i
must
be
afoot
he
poor
man
started
up
in
affright
dreaming
doubtless
that
the
fiend
had
returned
but
recovered
himself
making
a
low
obeisance
to
me
quickly
then
he
brought
out
bread
of
the
coarsest
and
cheese
of
the
best
grumbling
that
the
fiend
had
devoured
his
better
cheer
and
i
being
light
hearted
having
made
up
my
mind
and
being
young
enough
not
to
look
trouble
in
the
face
too
long
asked
him
if
he
had
none
of
the
roe
deer
left
over
whereat
he
started
and
looked
terrified
at
me
then
i
laughed
and
said
that
grendel
had
told
me
what
was
in
the
pot
and
the
man
seeing
that
i
was
not
angry
began
to
grin
also
wondering
then
the
meaning
of
the
whole
business
seemed
to
come
to
him
and
he
sat
down
and
began
to
laugh
looking
at
me
from
under
his
brows
now
and
then
lest
i
should
be
wroth
with
him
for
the
freedom
but
i
laughed
also
and
so
in
the
end
we
two
sat
and
laughed
till
the
tears
came
opposite
one
another
and
that
was
a
thing
that
i
had
never
thought
to
do
again
at
last
i
stopped
and
then
he
made
haste
to
compose
himself
master
he
said
forgive
me
but
if
you
were
grendel
as
i
think
now
there
is
a
great
fear
off
my
mind
i
was
grendel
dudda
said
i
but
you
must
have
a
sorely
evil
conscience
to
be
so
easily
frighted
nay
master
but
from
week
to
week
i
see
none
least
of
all
at
midnight
and
men
never
at
all
i
think
i
am
the
only
man
who
fears
not
this
marsh
and
what
may
haunt
it
that
you
may
never
boast
again
said
i
for
scared
you
were
and
that
badly
it
is
between
you
and
me
master
said
he
with
much
cunning
in
his
look
as
i
pray
the
matter
of
what
was
in
the
cauldron
may
be
also
well
as
for
that
i
answered
i
ate
it
and
was
glad
of
it
so
i
will
not
inquire
how
it
came
there
but
i
was
glad
to
have
this
secret
as
a
sort
of
hold
over
this
man
for
thralls
are
not
to
be
trusted
far
nor
was
i
in
a
mood
to
put
much
faith
in
any
after
that
we
ate
in
silence
and
when
we
had
finished
he
put
a
loaf
and
a
half
cheese
into
a
wallet
and
took
a
staff
and
asked
me
to
command
him
i
knew
not
what
the
hermit
had
told
him
so
asked
how
much
he
had
learned
of
my
errand
that
you
are
on
king
business
master
and
in
haste
moreover
that
your
errand
is
secret
so
that
you
would
not
be
seen
in
town
or
village
on
your
way
that
is
right
i
said
thanking
in
my
mind
the
good
hermit
whose
ready
wit
had
made
things
so
easy
for
me
moreover
it
was
truthful
enough
for
outlawry
is
king
business
in
all
earnest
though
not
the
honour
this
poor
thrall
doubtless
thought
was
put
on
me
then
i
told
him
that
i
need
ask
him
but
to
guide
me
beyond
parret
river
on
this
side
of
bridgwater
for
after
that
the
long
line
of
the
quantocks
would
guide
me
well
enough
it
was
all
i
needed
for
once
out
of
this
fenland
i
knew
the
country
well
aye
every
furlong
of
it
but
i
was
willing
enough
to
let
him
guide
me
through
land
i
knew
that
if
ever
he
were
questioned
as
he
might
well
be
when
my
outlawry
was
known
his
tale
of
my
little
knowledge
of
the
country
would
make
men
think
me
some
stranger
and
so
no
blame
would
come
on
him
for
harbouring
me
so
we
started
in
the
bright
early
morning
and
he
guided
me
well
there
is
little
to
say
of
that
journey
but
finding
from
the
man
talk
that
the
moot
rose
not
until
the
next
day
i
thought
with
a
lifting
of
my
heart
how
matelgar
would
likely
enough
be
yet
there
and
that
i
might
almost
in
safety
unless
he
had
sent
word
back
concerning
me
to
his
men
go
and
try
to
gain
speech
of
alswythe
now
it
chanced
presently
that
looking
about
me
i
seemed
to
know
the
lie
of
a
woodland
through
which
we
passed
and
in
a
little
was
sure
we
were
in
that
glade
where
i
fought
my
fight
and
next
i
saw
my
quarterstaff
still
resting
against
the
tree
where
i
had
left
it
the
collier
saw
it
too
and
said
that
some
forester
was
doubtless
resting
close
by
seeming
uneasy
about
the
same
but
i
said
that
no
question
should
be
made
of
his
presence
in
the
wood
if
it
were
so
and
we
came
up
to
it
then
he
started
and
cried
to
me
to
look
around
my
billhook
covered
with
new
rust
from
the
dew
lay
where
i
had
thrown
it
in
stripping
off
my
own
garments
to
arm
myself
but
of
the
man
i
had
slain
only
scattered
bones
were
left
the
wolves
had
devoured
him
when
i
saw
that
i
thought
that
this
dead
man
might
as
well
pass
for
myself
heregar
the
outlaw
so
i
examined
billhook
and
quarterstaff
and
at
last
said
i
knew
them
they
had
been
given
to
one
heregar
who
had
been
outlawed
and
driven
from
the
moot
even
as
i
stood
to
watch
the
gathering
as
i
passed
by
then
his
outlawry
has
ended
here
said
the
collier
the
wolves
have
devoured
him
just
as
well
i
said
carelessly
shall
you
take
his
staff
and
bill
they
are
good
enough
not
i
said
the
man
it
is
ill
meddling
with
strange
men
weapons
most
of
all
an
outlaw
mayhap
you
are
wise
i
said
and
casting
down
the
things
alongside
the
bones
went
on
now
i
had
looked
all
round
and
saw
that
my
old
garments
were
gone
so
that
the
man
i
had
let
go
had
at
all
events
started
away
with
them
but
now
i
knew
that
the
news
of
my
death
would
soon
spread
hard
on
the
publishing
of
the
sentence
of
outlawry
for
the
doings
of
an
outlaw
are
of
the
first
interest
to
those
among
whom
he
may
wander
as
it
was
indeed
to
my
guide
who
spoke
so
much
thereof
that
i
knew
he
would
be
full
of
it
and
tell
it
to
all
whom
he
met
and
when
he
told
me
he
should
go
back
through
the
town
i
was
glad
for
so
matelgar
would
have
news
of
the
same
confirming
the
tale
of
his
man
though
not
accounting
for
his
captain
whereby
he
would
be
puzzled
and
his
life
would
be
none
the
easier
for
i
knew
he
would
dread
my
vengeance
though
it
might
be
hard
for
me
to
compass
at
last
we
crossed
the
river
and
went
a
little
way
together
into
the
woods
beyond
till
we
came
to
the
road
which
should
lead
the
collier
back
to
bridgwater
town
and
there
i
made
him
give
me
directions
for
crossing
the
quantocks
as
though
i
would
go
by
triscombe
which
i
feigned
to
know
not
save
by
name
given
for
my
guidance
on
my
way
i
looked
for
him
to
ask
reward
but
he
did
not
and
what
the
hermit
had
told
him
i
could
not
say
unless
he
had
promised
him
reward
on
his
return
he
made
a
low
salutation
before
me
cap
in
hand
and
i
thanked
him
for
his
pains
saying
that
i
would
not
forget
him
as
i
was
sure
he
would
not
forget
grendel
and
so
we
laughed
and
he
went
away
pleased
enough
giving
me
the
wallet
of
food
then
was
i
left
alone
in
the
woodlands
that
had
been
mine
to
hunt
through
for
holding
our
land
from
the
king
himself
i
had
many
rights
that
stretched
far
and
wide
which
doubtless
that
matelgar
coveted
for
himself
and
would
now
enjoy
and
hard
it
was
and
bitter
exceedingly
not
to
turn
my
steps
straight
through
the
town
where
men
had
saluted
me
reverently
to
my
own
hall
where
it
nestles
under
the
great
rock
that
looks
out
over
my
low
meadows
and
away
towards
brent
across
the
wide
river
but
that
might
not
be
so
i
tried
to
stay
myself
with
the
thought
of
the
hermit
prophecy
and
plunging
deep
into
the
woods
crossed
far
back
of
my
own
place
until
i
could
circle
round
towards
matelgar
hall
and
there
i
must
go
carefully
lest
i
should
be
seen
and
known
by
any
but
the
woods
were
thick
and
none
knew
them
better
than
i
these
things
come
by
nature
to
a
man
and
so
i
should
not
be
proud
that
the
very
woodmen
would
own
that
i
was
their
master
in
all
the
craft
of
the
forest
as
my
father
had
been
before
me
now
matelgar
hall
smaller
than
mine
though
as
well
built
or
better
lay
in
that
glen
which
runs
down
towards
the
level
meadows
of
stert
point
between
severn
and
parret
north
of
the
little
hills
of
combwich
and
stockland
and
almost
under
that
last
and
there
the
forest
came
down
the
valley
for
it
is
not
enough
for
me
to
call
a
combe
almost
to
the
rear
of
the
hall
and
the
quickset
inclosure
around
it
it
was
afternoon
and
towards
evening
when
i
came
here
and
i
bided
in
the
woods
a
mile
from
the
hall
in
a
safe
place
where
none
ever
came
until
i
heard
the
horn
which
called
all
men
in
to
sup
then
when
i
judged
that
they
had
gathered
i
struck
towards
the
path
that
leads
down
to
the
hall
keeping
yet
under
cover
one
ran
in
haste
towards
his
supper
as
i
neared
it
so
i
knew
that
perhaps
he
was
the
last
to
take
his
place
and
that
for
an
hour
or
two
i
was
secure
now
in
this
wood
and
not
so
far
from
where
i
was
is
a
little
nook
with
a
fallen
tree
and
here
alswythe
and
her
mother
were
wont
to
come
in
the
warm
evenings
and
sit
while
the
feeding
in
hall
went
on
so
soon
as
they
could
leave
the
board
and
there
too
i
had
met
alswythe
often
lately
sitting
and
taking
pleasure
in
her
company
till
she
knew
that
i
would
want
no
better
companion
for
all
my
life
this
was
just
such
an
evening
as
might
tempt
her
there
and
i
would
at
least
have
the
sorrow
of
biding
there
alone
for
the
last
time
so
i
crept
to
that
place
very
softly
and
sat
me
down
to
think
maybe
i
had
sat
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
i
heard
a
step
coming
and
that
step
set
my
heart
beating
fast
for
it
was
the
one
i
longed
for
then
i
feared
to
frighten
her
with
sight
of
an
armed
man
in
her
retreat
but
before
i
could
move
she
came
round
the
bend
of
the
path
that
made
the
place
private
and
saw
me
she
gave
a
little
scream
and
half
turned
to
fly
for
she
was
alarmed
not
knowing
me
in
my
arms
and
all
i
could
do
was
to
take
off
my
helm
and
hold
out
my
hands
to
her
for
i
could
not
speak
her
name
in
my
joy
then
she
laid
her
hand
to
her
heart
and
paused
and
looked
and
before
i
could
step
towards
her
she
was
in
my
arms
of
her
own
will
so
i
was
content
now
how
we
two
found
ourselves
sitting
side
by
side
presently
in
the
old
place
i
may
hardly
say
but
so
it
was
and
i
forgot
all
about
her
father
and
the
evil
he
had
wrought
knowing
that
she
had
no
part
in
it
or
indeed
knowledge
thereof
for
when
we
came
to
talk
quietly
i
found
that
she
had
thought
me
dead
and
mourned
for
me
for
matelgar
had
told
her
that
he
knew
nought
of
me
and
i
would
not
tell
her
of
his
treachery
for
he
was
her
father
and
so
for
her
sake
i
made
such
a
tale
as
i
knew
he
was
like
to
tell
her
though
maybe
the
truth
would
come
sooner
or
later
how
that
secret
enemies
had
trapped
me
and
had
brought
false
charges
against
me
which
none
of
my
friends
could
combat
so
skilfully
were
they
wrought
and
then
how
that
i
was
outlawed
and
must
fly
and
hearing
this
she
wept
bitterly
fearing
and
with
reason
that
i
should
not
return
then
i
comforted
her
with
the
hermit
prophecy
saying
nought
of
her
father
and
she
sweet
soul
promised
that
matelgar
should
tend
my
lands
and
hall
well
till
the
words
of
the
holy
man
came
true
and
i
might
take
them
back
from
him
and
then
she
added
that
sorely
cast
down
and
troubled
had
her
father
seemed
when
he
rode
back
from
the
moot
that
day
and
doubtless
it
was
from
this
but
how
glad
would
he
be
to
know
me
living
and
even
now
would
take
me
in
and
set
me
on
my
way
notwithstanding
the
order
of
the
ealdorman
now
when
i
heard
that
matelgar
was
indeed
returned
and
so
close
to
me
i
knew
not
what
to
do
or
say
for
all
my
plans
that
he
should
think
me
dead
were
like
to
be
overthrown
by
the
talk
of
this
innocent
daughter
of
his
and
she
seeing
me
troubled
would
have
me
say
what
it
was
and
i
found
it
hard
to
answer
her
at
last
i
told
her
how
even
matelgar
dared
not
harbour
or
assist
me
and
cried
out
on
my
folly
in
bringing
blame
even
on
her
were
my
presence
known
but
she
stopped
my
mouth
telling
me
most
lovingly
that
the
risk
was
worth
the
running
so
that
she
knew
me
living
again
then
i
said
that
lest
harm
should
come
to
her
father
it
were
better
to
keep
secret
that
i
had
been
here
and
that
moreover
those
enemies
of
mine
would
doubtless
track
me
till
they
knew
me
gone
from
the
kingdom
so
that
were
a
whisper
to
go
abroad
that
i
had
been
seen
here
it
might
be
death
for
me
and
for
this
i
added
it
is
likely
that
matelgar
your
father
will
have
it
spread
abroad
that
i
am
dead
in
his
care
for
my
safety
for
so
will
question
about
me
and
where
i
am
cease
this
i
said
lest
she
should
deny
when
the
news
came
as
it
must
that
this
was
so
yet
she
longed
to
tell
her
father
that
i
was
here
but
at
last
i
overpersuaded
her
and
she
promised
to
tell
none
not
even
him
that
she
had
seen
me
and
for
my
sake
to
feign
to
believe
that
i
was
dead
then
we
must
part
i
told
her
my
plans
for
going
still
westward
to
make
myself
a
name
if
that
might
be
and
promised
to
let
her
have
news
of
me
if
and
when
i
might
and
in
all
to
be
true
to
her
and
she
brave
girl
would
try
not
to
weep
as
i
kissed
her
for
the
last
time
and
gave
me
the
little
silver
cross
from
her
neck
to
keep
for
her
sake
telling
me
that
she
would
pray
for
me
night
and
day
and
that
surely
her
prayers
and
those
of
the
holy
man
and
the
innocent
child
would
be
heard
for
me
so
that
the
prophecy
would
come
true
and
more
she
said
which
i
may
not
write
then
footsteps
came
up
the
main
path
and
i
must
go
i
heard
her
singing
as
she
went
back
to
the
hail
in
the
evening
light
and
knew
that
that
was
for
my
sake
and
not
for
lightness
of
heart
and
so
when
her
voice
died
away
i
plunged
again
into
the
woods
making
westward
while
light
lasted
chapter
the
vikings
arrive
now
after
i
had
parted
from
alswythe
my
true
love
i
could
not
forbear
a
little
heaviness
at
first
because
i
knew
not
when
i
should
see
her
again
but
there
is
a
wonderful
magic
in
youth
and
good
health
and
strength
and
yet
more
in
true
love
requited
which
will
charm
a
man
from
any
long
heaviness
so
before
long
as
i
went
through
the
twilight
woodlands
towards
the
mighty
quantock
hills
my
heart
grew
light
within
me
and
i
even
dared
to
weave
histories
in
my
mind
of
how
i
would
make
a
name
for
myself
and
so
return
in
high
honour
by
very
force
of
brave
deeds
done
deeds
that
should
be
spoken
of
through
all
the
land
it
is
a
strange
heart
in
a
youth
that
can
not
or
will
not
do
the
like
for
his
future
and
surely
want
of
such
thoughts
will
lead
him
to
nothing
great
even
if
it
does
not
bid
him
sink
to
the
level
of
his
own
thralls
as
i
have
known
men
fall
however
my
heart
was
full
of
brave
dreamings
always
with
the
thought
of
alswythe
as
my
reward
at
the
end
so
that
i
began
to
long
to
start
my
new
life
and
went
on
swiftly
that
i
might
the
sooner
leave
behind
the
land
that
was
to
be
closed
to
me
night
fell
as
i
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
long
combe
that
runs
up
under
triscombe
where
the
road
crosses
and
to
south
of
it
and
i
began
to
wonder
how
i
should
lodge
for
the
night
then
i
remembered
a
hut
deep
in
the
combe
that
would
serve
for
shelter
keeping
the
wolves
from
me
as
it
kept
them
from
the
woodmen
who
made
it
for
the
purpose
the
place
being
far
from
any
village
so
that
at
times
they
would
bide
there
for
nights
when
much
work
was
on
hand
none
would
be
there
in
maytime
for
the
season
for
felling
was
long
past
so
i
found
my
way
to
the
hut
and
there
built
a
fire
and
then
must
in
the
dark
grope
for
a
flint
wherewith
to
strike
light
on
steel
but
could
not
find
one
among
the
thick
herbage
so
i
sat
in
the
dark
eating
my
bread
and
cheese
and
thinking
how
that
i
was
like
to
make
a
poor
wanderer
if
i
thought
not
of
things
such
as
this
however
i
thought
my
wanderings
would
last
no
long
time
and
as
the
moon
rose
soon
i
was
content
enough
dreaming
of
her
from
whom
i
had
parted
so
lately
i
will
not
say
that
the
wish
for
revenge
on
matelgar
had
clean
gone
for
him
i
hated
sorely
but
for
me
to
strike
the
blow
that
i
had
longed
for
would
be
to
lose
alswythe
and
so
i
must
long
for
the
words
of
sooth
to
come
true
that
i
might
see
revenge
by
other
hands
than
mine
then
again
must
i
think
of
hurt
to
matelgar
as
of
hurt
to
alswythe
so
that
i
dared
not
ponder
much
on
the
matter
but
at
last
was
fain
to
be
minded
to
wait
and
let
the
hermit
words
work
themselves
out
and
again
fall
to
my
dreaming
of
great
deeds
to
come
out
of
those
dreams
i
had
a
rough
waking
that
told
me
that
i
was
not
all
a
cool
warrior
yet
something
brushed
by
the
door
of
the
hut
with
clatter
of
dry
chips
and
snarl
as
it
went
and
my
heart
stopped
and
then
beat
furiously
while
a
cold
chill
went
over
me
with
the
start
and
i
sprang
up
and
back
drawing
my
sword
and
it
was
but
a
gray
badger
pattering
past
the
hut
which
he
feared
not
it
having
been
deserted
for
so
long
on
his
search
for
food
then
i
was
angry
with
myself
for
i
could
not
have
been
more
feared
had
it
been
a
full
pack
of
wolves
but
at
last
i
laughed
at
my
fears
and
began
to
look
round
the
hut
in
the
moonlight
soon
i
had
shut
and
barred
the
heavy
door
and
laid
myself
down
to
sleep
with
a
log
for
pillow
though
sleep
seemed
long
in
coming
it
came
at
last
and
it
was
heavy
and
dreamless
until
the
sun
shone
through
the
chinks
between
the
logs
whereof
the
hut
was
built
and
i
woke
then
i
rose
up
opened
the
door
and
looked
out
on
the
morning
the
level
sunbeams
crept
through
the
trees
and
made
everything
very
fresh
and
fair
and
a
little
light
frost
hung
over
twigs
and
young
fern
fronds
everywhere
so
that
i
seemed
in
the
land
of
fairy
instead
of
the
quantocks
the
birds
were
singing
loudly
and
a
squirrel
came
and
chattered
at
me
and
then
running
up
a
bough
sat
up
still
as
if
carved
from
the
wood
it
was
resting
on
and
watched
me
seemingly
without
fear
then
i
went
down
the
combe
and
sought
a
pool
and
bathed
and
ate
the
last
of
the
food
the
collier
had
given
me
where
i
should
get
more
i
knew
not
nor
cared
just
then
for
it
was
enough
to
carry
me
on
for
the
next
day
and
night
if
need
be
seeing
that
i
had
been
bred
to
a
hunter
life
in
the
open
and
a
saxon
should
need
but
one
full
meal
in
the
day
whether
first
or
last
now
while
i
ate
and
thought
it
seemed
harder
to
me
to
leave
these
hills
and
combes
that
i
loved
than
it
had
seemed
overnight
and
at
last
i
thought
i
would
traverse
them
once
again
and
so
make
to
the
headland
above
watchet
and
quantoxhead
on
either
side
and
then
down
along
the
shore
always
deserted
there
to
the
hills
above
minehead
by
skirting
round
watchet
and
so
on
into
the
great
and
lonely
moors
beyond
where
i
could
go
into
house
or
hamlet
without
fear
of
being
known
then
i
remembered
that
to
seek
help
in
the
villages
must
be
to
ask
charity
that
would
be
freely
given
doubtless
but
would
lead
to
questions
and
moreover
my
pride
forbade
me
to
ask
in
that
way
then
again
for
a
man
so
subsisting
it
might
be
hard
to
win
a
way
to
a
great
man
favour
though
indeed
a
stout
warrior
was
always
sure
to
find
welcome
with
him
who
had
lands
to
protect
but
not
so
certainly
with
the
other
housecarles
among
whom
he
would
come
so
i
began
to
see
that
my
plight
was
worse
than
i
thought
and
sat
there
with
my
back
to
an
ash
tree
while
the
birds
sang
round
me
and
was
downcast
for
a
while
then
suddenly
as
i
traced
the
course
that
i
had
laid
out
in
my
mind
going
over
the
hunts
of
the
old
days
when
i
rode
beside
my
father
and
since
i
bethought
me
of
one
day
when
the
stag
a
great
one
of
twelve
points
took
to
the
sea
just
this
side
of
watchet
town
swimming
out
bravely
into
severn
tide
so
that
we
might
hardly
see
him
from
the
strand
there
went
out
three
men
in
a
little
skiff
to
take
him
having
with
them
the
young
son
of
the
owner
of
the
boat
and
in
some
way
the
boat
was
overturned
as
they
came
back
towing
the
stag
after
them
when
some
hundred
or
more
yards
from
shore
and
in
deep
water
where
a
swift
current
ran
two
men
clung
to
the
upturned
boat
but
the
other
must
swim
holding
up
his
son
who
though
a
big
boy
of
fourteen
was
helpless
in
the
water
and
i
saw
that
it
was
like
to
go
hard
with
both
of
them
for
the
current
bore
them
away
from
shore
and
boat
alike
so
i
rode
in
and
my
horse
swam
well
and
we
reached
them
in
time
so
that
i
took
the
boy
by
his
long
hair
and
raised
him
above
the
water
while
the
man
his
father
swam
beside
us
and
we
got
safely
back
to
the
beach
they
exhausted
enough
but
safe
and
i
pleased
that
my
good
horse
did
so
well
but
the
man
would
have
it
that
i
and
not
the
horse
saved
his
son
and
was
most
grateful
bidding
me
command
him
in
anything
all
his
life
long
even
to
life
itself
saying
that
he
owed
me
both
his
own
and
the
boy
and
that
made
me
fain
to
laugh
it
away
being
uneasy
at
his
praise
which
seemed
overmuch
however
as
we
rode
home
my
father
said
i
had
made
a
friend
for
life
and
that
one
never
knew
when
such
would
be
wanted
now
this
man
was
a
franklin
and
by
no
means
a
poor
one
so
now
at
last
i
remembered
my
father
words
and
knew
that
i
was
glad
to
have
one
friend
whom
i
knew
well
enough
would
not
turn
away
from
me
for
i
had
seen
him
many
times
since
and
liked
him
well
i
would
go
to
him
tell
him
all
if
he
had
not
yet
heard
it
which
was
possible
and
so
ask
him
to
lend
me
a
few
silver
pieces
in
my
need
i
knew
he
would
welcome
the
chance
of
showing
the
honesty
of
his
words
and
might
well
afford
it
thus
would
i
go
after
dark
lest
i
should
be
seen
and
he
blamed
and
so
make
onward
with
a
lighter
heart
and
freer
hand
so
i
waited
a
little
longer
in
the
safe
recesses
of
the
deep
combe
until
a
great
gray
cloud
covered
all
the
tops
of
the
hills
above
me
and
i
thought
it
well
to
cross
the
open
under
its
shelter
to
holford
coombe
which
i
did
there
i
loitered
again
hearing
the
stags
belling
at
times
across
the
hollows
to
one
another
but
hardly
wishful
to
meet
with
them
in
their
anger
i
saw
no
man
for
once
i
had
crossed
the
highroad
none
was
likely
to
seek
the
heights
in
maytime
and
i
think
that
no
one
would
have
known
me
for
in
my
captivity
my
beard
had
grown
and
my
hair
was
longer
than
its
wont
and
when
i
had
seen
my
face
in
the
little
pool
that
morning
i
myself
had
started
back
from
the
older
bearded
and
stern
face
that
met
me
instead
of
the
fine
smooth
young
looks
that
had
been
mine
on
the
night
of
my
last
feast
but
there
were
many
at
the
moot
which
was
even
now
dispersing
who
had
seen
only
this
new
face
of
mine
and
i
could
not
trust
to
remaining
long
unrecognized
none
might
harm
me
that
was
true
but
to
be
driven
on
like
a
stray
dog
from
place
to
place
man
to
man
for
fear
of
what
should
be
done
to
him
who
aided
me
in
word
or
deed
was
worse
to
my
thought
than
open
enmity
now
as
night
fell
the
clouds
thickened
up
overhead
but
it
was
still
and
clear
below
if
dark
and
by
the
time
the
night
fairly
closed
in
i
stood
on
the
heights
above
watchet
and
looking
down
over
the
broad
channel
and
to
my
left
saw
the
glimmering
lights
of
the
little
town
there
i
waited
a
little
pondering
the
safest
way
and
time
for
reaching
the
franklin
house
for
i
would
not
bring
trouble
on
him
by
being
seen
all
the
while
i
looked
out
over
the
sea
and
then
i
saw
something
else
that
i
could
not
at
first
make
out
somewhere
on
the
sea
right
off
the
mouth
of
the
watchet
haven
and
seemingly
close
under
me
there
flashed
brightly
a
light
for
a
moment
and
instantly
far
out
in
the
open
water
another
such
flash
answered
it
seen
and
gone
in
an
instant
then
came
four
more
such
flashes
each
a
little
nearer
than
the
second
and
from
different
places
then
i
found
that
the
first
and
one
other
near
it
were
not
quite
vanished
but
that
i
could
see
a
spark
of
them
still
glowing
now
while
i
wondered
what
this
might
mean
those
two
nearer
lights
began
to
creep
in
towards
the
haven
closer
and
closer
and
as
they
did
so
flashed
up
again
and
answering
flashes
came
from
the
other
places
the
night
was
still
and
i
sat
down
to
see
more
or
this
knowing
that
they
who
made
these
signals
must
be
in
ships
or
boats
but
not
knowing
why
they
were
made
or
why
so
many
ships
should
be
gathered
off
the
haven
anyway
there
would
be
many
people
about
to
meet
them
if
they
came
in
and
that
would
not
suit
me
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
light
from
the
nearest
ship
flamed
up
bright
and
strong
and
moved
very
fast
towards
the
haven
and
the
others
followed
for
first
one
light
and
then
another
came
into
sight
like
the
first
two
as
they
drew
near
i
knew
not
much
about
ships
but
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
lanterns
were
on
deck
and
hidden
from
the
shore
by
the
bulwarks
perhaps
but
that
being
so
high
above
i
could
look
down
on
them
if
they
be
honest
vessels
thought
i
all
of
a
sudden
why
do
they
hide
their
lights
for
often
had
i
seen
the
trading
busses
pass
up
our
parret
river
at
night
with
bright
torches
burning
on
deck
what
was
that
very
faint
and
far
away
there
came
up
to
me
in
the
still
air
for
what
breeze
there
was
set
from
the
sea
to
me
a
chant
sung
by
many
rough
voices
a
chant
that
set
my
blood
spinning
through
me
and
that
started
me
to
my
feet
running
with
all
the
speed
i
could
make
in
the
darkness
to
warn
watchet
town
that
the
vikings
were
on
them
for
now
i
knew
i
had
heard
the
heysaa
the
war
song
of
the
danes
but
before
i
could
cover
in
the
dark
more
than
two
miles
i
stopped
for
i
was
too
late
there
shot
up
a
tongue
of
flame
from
watchet
town
and
then
another
and
another
and
the
ringing
of
the
church
bell
came
to
me
for
a
little
and
then
that
stopped
and
up
on
minehead
height
burnt
out
a
war
beacon
that
soon
paled
to
nothing
in
the
glare
of
the
burning
houses
in
the
town
i
could
fancy
i
heard
yells
and
shrieks
from
thence
but
maybe
that
was
fancy
though
i
know
they
were
there
for
me
to
hear
truly
enough
but
i
could
do
nothing
the
town
was
too
evidently
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
and
i
could
only
climb
up
the
hill
again
and
watch
where
the
ships
went
perhaps
as
i
had
seen
them
come
as
i
clomb
the
hill
the
heavy
smell
of
the
smoke
caught
me
up
and
bided
with
me
making
me
wild
with
fury
against
the
plunderers
and
against
matelgar
in
that
now
i
might
not
call
out
my
own
men
and
ride
to
the
sheriff
levy
with
them
and
fight
for
wessex
as
was
my
right
and
these
danes
or
northmen
whichever
they
might
be
but
we
called
them
all
danes
without
much
distinction
were
the
very
men
with
whom
i
had
thought
to
join
when
i
won
down
to
cornwall
one
thing
i
could
do
i
could
fire
the
beacon
on
the
quantocks
that
was
a
good
thought
and
i
hurried
to
the
point
where
i
knew
it
was
ever
piled
ready
since
the
day
of
charnmouth
fight
two
years
agone
i
found
it
and
hammering
with
the
flint
i
had
found
in
case
of
such
a
necessity
as
last
night
i
kindled
the
dry
fern
at
its
foot
to
windward
and
up
it
blazed
then
in
a
quarter
hour
time
it
was
answered
from
brent
and
from
a
score
of
hills
around
now
as
i
stood
by
the
fire
i
heard
the
sound
of
running
footsteps
far
off
yet
and
knew
they
were
the
messengers
who
were
bidden
to
fire
the
beacon
so
i
slipped
aside
into
cover
of
its
smoke
and
lay
down
in
a
little
hollow
under
some
bushes
where
i
could
both
see
and
hear
them
when
they
came
they
were
four
in
all
and
were
panting
from
their
run
who
fired
the
beacon
said
one
looking
round
never
mind
said
another
we
shall
have
credit
for
mighty
diligence
in
doing
it
but
said
the
first
he
should
be
here
then
they
forgot
that
in
the
greater
interest
they
had
left
or
escaped
from
and
began
to
talk
of
the
vikings
the
men
from
two
ships
had
landed
i
learned
and
had
surprised
the
place
scarce
had
any
time
to
flee
none
to
save
goods
they
mentioned
certain
names
of
the
slain
whom
they
had
seen
fall
and
of
these
one
was
the
franklin
whom
i
was
going
to
seek
there
was
no
help
for
me
thence
now
one
man
said
he
had
heard
there
were
more
ships
lying
off
but
they
did
not
know
how
many
and
i
could
see
they
had
been
in
too
great
haste
to
care
to
learn
soon
fugitives
men
women
and
children
began
to
straggle
in
wretched
little
groups
up
the
hill
weeping
and
groaning
and
i
knew
there
would
soon
be
too
many
there
for
my
liking
so
i
crept
away
easily
enough
and
went
out
to
the
headland
but
i
could
see
nothing
on
the
sea
now
and
so
very
sad
at
heart
i
sought
a
bushy
hollow
and
laid
me
down
and
slept
while
the
smoke
of
watchet
hung
round
me
and
now
and
then
a
brighter
glare
flashed
over
the
low
clouds
as
the
roof
of
some
building
fell
in
and
fed
the
flames
afresh
i
woke
in
the
light
of
the
gray
dawn
and
the
smell
of
burning
was
gone
and
the
sea
i
looked
out
on
was
clear
again
for
a
fresh
breeze
from
the
eastward
was
sweeping
the
smoke
as
i
could
see
away
to
the
other
hills
westward
but
the
town
was
gone
only
a
smoke
was
left
for
all
there
was
for
me
to
look
down
on
instead
of
the
and
roofs
that
i
had
so
often
seen
before
from
that
place
or
near
it
next
i
saw
the
ships
of
the
vikings
they
lay
out
in
the
channel
at
anchor
for
the
tide
was
failing
i
suppose
they
had
gone
into
the
little
haven
as
soon
as
there
was
water
enough
and
that
those
lights
i
saw
were
signs
made
from
one
to
the
other
when
that
was
so
there
were
specks
near
them
moving
their
boats
no
doubt
from
the
shore
bringing
off
plunder
the
long
ships
themselves
looked
like
barley
corns
from
so
high
above
or
so
i
thought
them
to
look
if
they
were
larger
to
sight
than
that
for
that
was
their
shape
now
i
had
not
thought
that
they
would
have
bided
when
the
beacons
were
lit
but
would
have
gone
out
westward
with
this
tide
and
therefore
i
wondered
what
their
next
move
would
be
but
expected
to
see
them
up
anchor
and
go
soon
waiting
so
i
waxed
hungry
for
nought
had
i
tasted
save
a
few
eggs
that
i
had
found
in
holford
coombe
since
that
time
yesterday
birds
eggs
thought
i
were
better
than
nought
so
i
wandered
among
the
bushes
seeking
more
as
i
did
so
by
and
by
i
came
in
sight
of
the
beacon
on
the
hilltop
and
looking
up
at
it
rather
blaming
my
carelessness
saw
that
but
two
men
were
there
tending
it
and
from
their
silver
collars
i
knew
that
they
were
thralls
they
were
putting
on
green
bushes
to
make
a
smother
and
black
smoke
that
would
warn
men
that
the
enemy
were
yet
at
hand
when
i
saw
that
both
the
men
were
strange
to
me
i
went
up
to
them
as
though
come
to
find
out
news
of
the
business
and
they
saluted
me
evidently
not
knowing
me
i
talked
with
them
awhile
and
then
shared
their
breakfast
with
them
glad
enough
of
it
they
had
however
no
more
to
tell
me
than
i
had
already
learnt
beyond
tales
of
horror
brought
by
the
fugitives
of
last
night
which
i
will
not
write
those
people
had
soon
passed
on
fearing
as
each
new
group
came
up
that
the
enemy
was
on
their
heels
they
had
doubtless
scattered
into
the
villages
beyond
so
the
time
went
idly
and
the
sun
rose
while
yet
the
tide
fell
and
the
ships
lay
beneath
us
smoke
as
of
cooking
fires
rose
from
their
decks
and
they
were
evidently
in
no
hurry
nor
need
they
be
in
those
days
we
had
no
warships
such
as
our
wise
king
has
made
us
since
then
and
none
could
harm
them
on
the
open
water
in
an
hour
time
however
there
came
a
change
over
the
sea
little
waves
began
to
curl
over
it
and
when
the
sun
broke
out
it
flashed
bright
where
the
wind
came
over
in
flaws
here
and
there
then
from
each
ship
were
unfurled
great
sails
striped
in
bright
colours
and
one
by
one
they
got
under
way
and
headed
over
towards
the
welsh
coast
beyond
channel
the
tide
had
turned
they
are
going
said
i
with
much
gladness
one
of
the
men
shook
his
head
they
do
but
slant
across
the
wind
master
presently
they
will
go
about
and
so
fetch
the
wessex
shore
again
and
so
on
till
they
reach
where
they
will
up
channel
we
watched
them
and
while
we
watched
a
man
came
up
from
the
west
heated
and
tired
out
and
limping
with
long
running
as
it
seemed
and
when
he
saw
me
he
ran
straight
to
me
and
thrusting
a
splinter
of
wood
into
my
hand
cried
in
a
panting
voice
i
can
no
more
in
the
king
name
to
matelgar
of
stert
the
levy
is
at
bridgwater
cross
in
all
haste
it
was
the
war
arrow
vi
no
man
might
refuse
to
bear
that
onward
yet
to
matelgar
and
by
an
outlaw
but
the
man
was
beat
and
the
thralls
might
not
bear
it
look
at
me
know
you
who
i
am
i
said
to
the
man
who
had
cast
himself
down
on
the
grass
panting
again
no
nor
care
he
said
glancing
at
me
sharply
on
and
tarry
not
i
am
an
outlaw
i
said
simply
armed
he
said
with
a
laugh
outlaw
in
truth
you
will
be
an
you
speed
not
i
am
heregar
i
said
again
curse
you
said
the
man
go
on
and
prate
not
if
you
were
ealhstan
himself
with
his
forked
hat
on
you
must
go
heregar
my
master
friend
cried
one
of
the
two
thralls
if
it
be
true
you
are
outlawed
as
i
heard
yesterday
go
and
win
yourself
inlawed
again
by
this
then
i
turned
and
wasted
no
more
time
running
swiftly
down
the
hill
and
away
towards
the
spot
where
my
enemy
lay
at
stert
and
that
honest
thrall
of
my
friend
the
slain
franklin
shouted
after
me
for
good
speed
well
i
thought
as
i
went
on
at
a
loping
pace
i
can
prove
my
loyalty
maybe
but
i
have
to
bear
this
into
the
wolf
den
and
much
the
proof
will
serve
me
then
i
thought
that
presently
i
would
feign
lameness
and
send
on
some
other
and
so
i
ran
on
i
struck
a
path
soon
and
kept
it
knowing
that
if
one
met
and
recognized
me
the
token
i
bore
was
pass
enough
moreover
none
might
harm
me
if
they
would
so
that
i
was
doing
no
wrong
in
being
turned
back
as
it
were
by
emergency
from
leaving
the
kingdom
now
as
i
trotted
swiftly
along
the
track
there
lay
in
my
way
what
i
thought
was
a
stone
till
i
neared
it
then
i
saw
that
it
was
a
bag
and
so
picked
it
up
hardly
pausing
shaking
it
as
i
did
so
it
was
full
of
money
doubtless
some
one
of
the
fugitives
dropped
it
last
night
as
they
went
in
haste
hardly
knowing
they
had
it
perhaps
well
better
with
me
than
with
the
danes
i
thought
and
so
bestowed
the
bag
inside
my
mail
shirt
and
thanked
the
man
who
sent
me
on
this
errand
for
now
i
felt
as
if
free
once
more
for
with
sword
and
mail
and
money
what
more
does
man
need
when
next
i
came
to
a
place
that
looked
out
over
sea
i
could
no
more
spy
the
ships
they
must
have
stretched
far
across
to
the
welsh
coast
only
the
two
holms
broke
the
line
of
water
to
the
north
and
east
up
channel
then
the
thought
came
to
me
that
the
danes
were
gone
and
what
use
going
further
with
this
errand
but
that
was
not
my
business
the
war
arrow
must
go
round
and
the
bearer
must
not
fail
or
else
nidring
vii
should
he
be
from
henceforward
so
i
went
on
now
at
last
was
i
but
a
mile
or
two
from
stert
and
began
to
wish
to
meet
one
to
whom
to
give
the
arrow
but
saw
no
man
i
turned
aside
to
a
little
cluster
of
thralls
and
churls
huts
i
knew
there
were
no
people
there
and
one
hut
was
burnt
down
afterwards
i
heard
that
they
had
been
deserted
by
reason
of
some
pestilence
that
had
been
there
but
now
it
seemed
like
a
warning
to
do
the
duty
that
had
been
thrust
on
me
then
at
last
i
remembered
the
prophecy
of
the
old
hermit
and
my
heart
bounded
within
me
for
indeed
unlooked
for
as
this
was
surely
it
was
like
the
beginning
of
its
working
out
now
would
i
go
through
with
it
and
on
the
head
of
matelgar
be
the
blame
were
i
slain
known
was
i
by
name
to
the
messenger
who
gave
me
the
arrow
and
to
those
thralls
and
known
therefore
would
my
going
to
matelgar
be
nevertheless
when
i
went
down
that
path
that
i
have
spoken
of
toward
the
hall
looking
to
meet
with
one
at
every
turn
my
heart
beat
thick
enough
for
a
time
till
a
great
coolness
came
over
me
and
i
feared
nought
yet
must
i
turn
aside
one
moment
to
lock
into
that
nook
where
alswythe
and
i
had
met
but
it
was
empty
i
knew
that
it
must
be
so
at
that
hour
but
i
was
of
my
love
constrained
to
go
there
then
i
ran
boldly
round
the
outer
palisade
and
came
to
the
great
gate
chapter
vi
in
the
wolf
den
there
was
only
one
man
near
it
and
he
sat
on
the
settle
inside
so
that
he
could
see
out
and
in
as
he
wished
him
i
knew
at
once
and
was
glad
for
it
was
that
old
warrior
who
had
showed
some
liking
for
me
at
brent
he
got
up
slowly
as
he
saw
a
stranger
stand
in
the
gateway
and
came
out
towards
me
then
he
started
a
little
and
frowned
rash
master
rash
he
said
but
not
loudly
this
is
no
safe
place
for
you
and
he
motioned
me
to
fly
then
i
beckoned
him
out
a
little
further
and
showed
him
what
i
bore
in
my
hand
and
he
was
fairly
amazed
and
knew
not
what
to
say
that
i
an
outlaw
should
have
been
sent
on
this
errand
and
more
that
i
should
have
come
i
told
him
speaking
quickly
and
shortly
how
it
had
come
about
and
he
understood
that
the
man
who
gave
me
the
arrow
neither
knew
nor
believed
me
master
he
said
when
i
had
done
verily
i
believe
that
you
are
true
and
wronged
by
him
i
have
served
this
past
two
months
but
of
this
i
know
not
for
certain
being
a
stranger
here
and
little
knowing
of
place
or
people
but
this
i
know
from
the
man
you
sent
back
that
our
thane
sought
your
life
against
the
word
of
the
ealdorman
and
moreover
believes
that
you
are
dead
but
by
the
arms
you
wear
i
can
learn
how
that
matter
really
went
now
give
me
the
arrow
and
i
will
see
to
this
do
you
fly
but
i
was
bent
on
ending
the
errand
and
said
i
would
carry
out
the
task
as
was
my
duty
to
the
end
i
would
put
the
arrow
with
its
message
into
matelgar
hand
and
bide
what
might
come
he
tried
to
dissuade
me
but
at
last
said
that
he
would
not
stand
by
and
see
me
harmed
and
for
that
i
thanked
him
well
then
he
told
me
you
have
come
in
a
good
hour
most
of
the
men
have
gone
out
here
and
there
to
spy
what
they
may
of
the
danes
and
their
plans
if
gone
or
not
others
are
in
the
stables
and
but
one
man
sits
at
the
door
of
the
great
hall
and
he
is
of
no
account
where
is
matelgar
i
asked
i
know
not
exactly
but
do
as
i
say
and
all
will
be
well
then
i
said
that
his
advice
had
saved
me
i
thought
when
before
the
moot
and
i
would
follow
it
here
then
he
went
on
come
you
to
the
hall
door
and
bide
there
while
i
go
in
and
call
the
thane
thither
he
will
stay
by
his
great
chair
to
hear
your
message
and
i
will
stand
by
the
man
who
keeps
the
door
then
when
you
have
given
up
the
arrow
tarry
not
but
come
out
at
once
and
get
out
of
this
gate
lest
he
should
raise
some
alarm
then
must
you
take
to
the
woods
quickly
so
he
turned
and
went
in
before
me
there
were
some
twenty
yards
of
courtyard
to
be
crossed
before
we
came
to
the
great
hall
round
which
the
other
buildings
clustered
inside
the
palisades
but
there
were
no
men
about
though
i
could
hear
them
whistling
at
their
morning
work
in
the
stables
for
the
idle
time
of
the
day
was
yet
to
come
only
a
boy
crossed
from
one
side
to
the
other
on
some
errand
behind
us
and
paid
no
attention
beyond
pausing
a
little
to
stare
as
i
could
judge
by
his
footsteps
at
any
other
time
i
should
not
have
noticed
even
that
but
now
that
i
was
in
the
very
jaws
of
the
wolf
as
it
were
i
saw
and
heard
everything
and
all
the
while
my
heart
beat
fast
but
that
was
not
from
fear
but
for
thinking
i
might
by
chance
see
alswythe
yet
i
will
say
it
truly
that
thought
of
her
had
no
share
in
bringing
me
on
this
mad
errand
which
might
have
ending
in
such
fashion
as
would
break
her
heart
one
man
as
my
guide
had
said
sat
just
inside
the
hall
but
i
knew
him
not
since
he
had
my
hall
and
his
own
to
tend
matelgar
must
have
hired
more
and
new
housecarles
this
man
was
trimming
a
bow
at
the
hearth
and
did
not
rise
seeing
that
whoever
i
might
be
i
was
brought
in
by
his
comrade
the
great
hall
looked
wide
and
empty
for
the
long
tables
were
cleared
away
and
only
the
settle
by
the
hearth
in
the
centre
remained
beside
the
thane
own
carved
seat
on
the
dais
at
the
far
end
bide
by
the
fire
till
he
comes
said
my
guide
seeing
that
the
man
did
not
know
me
and
leaving
me
there
he
went
through
a
door
beyond
the
thane
chair
to
seek
him
so
i
stood
where
the
smoke
rose
between
me
and
that
door
waiting
and
warming
my
hands
quietly
and
as
unconcernedly
to
all
seeing
as
i
could
ho
friend
said
the
man
so
suddenly
that
he
made
me
start
look
at
your
sword
hilt
before
the
thane
comes
and
he
pointed
and
grinned
sure
enough
my
sword
hilt
was
not
fastened
to
the
sheath
as
it
should
be
in
a
peaceful
hall
but
the
thong
hung
loose
as
if
ready
for
me
to
thrust
wrist
through
before
drawing
the
blade
so
i
grinned
back
without
a
word
lest
matelgar
should
hear
my
voice
and
know
it
and
began
to
pretend
to
knot
the
thong
round
the
scabbard
all
the
same
i
was
not
going
to
fasten
it
so
that
i
could
not
draw
if
need
were
and
only
kept
on
plaiting
and
twisting
then
i
heard
matelgar
voice
and
footstep
and
i
desisted
and
taking
the
arrow
from
my
belt
stood
up
and
ready
he
came
in
looking
round
but
not
seeing
me
at
first
through
the
blue
smoke
for
as
i
knew
he
would
he
entered
by
the
door
through
which
my
guide
had
gone
just
now
so
i
waited
till
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
his
chair
while
the
old
warrior
came
down
towards
me
then
i
strode
forward
boldly
up
to
the
foot
of
the
dais
and
looking
steadily
a
matelgar
cast
the
arrow
at
his
feet
saying
in
the
king
name
the
levy
is
at
bridgwater
cross
in
all
haste
he
threw
up
his
hands
as
one
too
terrified
to
draw
sword
who
would
ward
off
some
sudden
terror
giving
back
a
pace
or
two
and
staring
at
me
with
wild
eyes
his
face
grew
white
as
milk
and
drawn
and
his
breath
went
in
between
his
teeth
with
a
long
hissing
sound
but
he
spoke
no
word
and
as
he
stood
there
i
turned
and
walked
out
into
the
courtyard
and
to
the
gate
going
steadily
and
without
looking
round
like
a
man
who
has
nothing
either
to
keep
or
hurry
him
three
grooms
whom
i
knew
stood
with
an
unbridled
horse
on
one
side
but
they
were
busy
and
minded
me
not
till
i
was
just
at
the
gate
then
one
said
to
the
other
yonder
goes
heregar
as
i
live
then
there
came
a
cry
like
a
howl
of
rage
from
the
hall
but
no
word
of
command
as
yet
nor
did
either
housecarle
come
out
that
i
could
hear
then
i
was
at
the
gate
and
as
i
passed
it
turning
sharp
to
the
right
for
that
was
the
nearest
way
to
the
woods
i
heard
one
running
across
the
court
when
i
heard
that
instead
of
keeping
straight
on
i
doubled
quickly
round
the
angle
of
the
palisade
by
the
time
i
had
turned
it
the
man
may
have
been
at
the
gate
and
would
think
me
vanished
but
now
i
ran
and
got
to
cover
in
a
thicket
close
to
the
rear
of
the
house
a
bad
place
enough
but
i
must
chance
it
i
could
hear
shouts
now
from
the
courtyard
i
looked
round
for
a
way
to
escape
but
to
reach
the
woods
i
had
now
a
long
bit
of
open
ground
to
cover
and
was
puzzled
then
overhead
i
heard
a
bird
rustle
and
i
looked
up
and
at
once
a
thought
came
to
me
the
tree
was
an
old
gnarled
ash
and
the
leaves
on
it
were
thick
for
the
time
of
year
moreover
the
branches
were
so
large
that
surely
in
the
fork
i
could
find
a
hiding
place
and
being
so
close
to
the
hall
search
would
be
with
little
if
any
care
so
with
a
little
difficulty
i
climbed
up
and
there
sure
enough
found
the
tree
hollow
in
the
fork
so
that
if
i
crouched
down
none
could
see
me
from
below
while
lying
flat
against
a
great
branch
i
could
safely
see
something
of
what
might
be
on
hand
i
was
hardly
sure
of
this
when
men
began
to
spread
here
and
there
about
the
place
but
mostly
going
in
the
direction
of
the
woods
i
heard
matelgar
voice
harsh
and
loud
promising
reward
to
him
who
should
bring
in
the
outlaw
dead
or
alive
and
presently
saw
him
stand
clear
of
the
palisading
about
a
bowshot
from
me
he
was
red
enough
now
but
his
hand
played
nervously
with
his
sword
hilt
and
once
when
men
shouted
in
the
wood
he
clutched
it
clearly
i
had
terrified
him
and
if
he
deemed
me
as
it
seemed
a
ghost
at
first
sight
the
token
of
the
arrow
had
undeceived
him
and
little
rest
would
he
have
now
night
or
day
while
i
was
yet
at
large
so
i
laughed
to
myself
and
watched
him
till
he
went
back
presently
the
men
straggled
in
too
one
party
having
made
a
circle
came
close
by
me
and
they
were
laughing
and
saying
that
the
thane
had
seen
a
ghost
moreover
said
another
we
saw
him
cross
the
court
slowly
enough
and
when
we
got
to
the
gate
lo
he
was
gone
then
one
said
that
he
had
heard
the
like
before
and
their
voices
died
away
as
he
told
the
story
soon
after
this
the
horns
were
blown
to
recall
all
the
men
and
i
knew
that
matelgar
must
needs
even
were
it
a
ghost
who
brought
the
war
arrow
lead
his
following
to
the
sheriff
levy
aye
and
the
following
that
should
be
mine
as
well
the
message
i
had
brought
should
have
been
to
me
as
a
king
thane
and
i
myself
should
have
sent
one
to
matelgar
to
bid
him
come
to
the
levy
even
as
he
would
now
send
to
the
other
lesser
thanes
and
the
franklins
round
about
in
my
place
the
men
were
running
out
even
now
north
and
west
and
east
as
i
thought
of
this
in
my
bitterness
and
i
watched
them
knowing
well
to
whom
this
one
and
that
must
go
in
each
quarter
this
was
hard
to
think
of
yet
i
had
stood
in
matelgar
presence
and
had
him
in
my
power
for
a
minute
while
i
might
have
struck
him
down
and
had
not
done
so
and
all
that
long
night
in
sedgemoor
i
had
promised
myself
just
such
a
moment
and
had
pictured
him
falling
at
my
feet
my
revenge
taken
but
how
long
ago
that
seemed
truly
i
was
like
another
man
then
and
since
that
night
there
had
been
the
wise
counsel
of
the
hermit
the
prattle
of
the
child
the
touch
and
voice
of
my
loved
one
the
thought
of
a
true
friend
and
now
the
sore
need
of
the
country
i
loved
and
for
the
sake
of
all
those
things
i
do
not
wonder
that
as
i
saw
matelgar
pale
and
tremble
before
me
the
thought
of
slaying
him
never
entered
my
head
i
will
not
say
that
i
was
much
conscious
of
all
these
things
moulding
my
conduct
but
i
know
that
since
i
took
this
message
on
me
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
prophecy
was
on
its
way
to
fulfilment
i
had
as
it
were
stood
by
to
see
another
avenger
then
myself
at
work
in
a
way
that
should
unfold
itself
presently
so
sure
was
i
that
all
would
come
out
as
the
hermit
foretold
so
it
was
with
a
sort
of
confidence
and
a
boy
love
of
adventure
too
that
i
had
run
into
danger
thus
while
now
that
i
had
come
off
so
well
my
confidence
was
yet
stronger
however
it
would
not
make
me
foolhardy
for
my
father
was
wont
to
tell
me
that
one
may
only
trust
to
luck
after
all
care
taken
to
be
well
off
without
it
men
came
trooping
in
from
the
nearer
houses
and
farms
very
soon
armed
and
excited
often
some
passed
under
me
not
ten
paces
off
and
then
i
shrank
down
into
the
hollow
all
spoke
of
the
danes
as
gone
but
at
last
one
said
he
thought
he
could
see
them
away
by
steepholme
island
half
an
hour
agone
though
it
might
be
fancy
he
added
for
their
ships
were
very
low
and
hard
to
see
if
no
sail
were
spread
but
from
all
i
gathered
the
danes
were
over
on
the
other
coast
and
out
of
our
way
for
the
time
at
least
then
i
grew
very
stiff
in
the
tree
but
so
many
were
about
that
i
dared
not
come
down
they
were
however
mostly
gathered
in
the
open
in
front
of
the
great
gate
and
only
passers
by
came
near
me
it
was
some
three
hours
after
noon
before
they
gathered
into
ranks
at
last
and
the
roll
was
called
over
by
matelgar
himself
as
he
rode
along
the
line
fully
armed
when
that
was
done
he
put
himself
at
the
head
and
they
filed
off
up
the
road
towards
bridgwater
i
remembered
that
when
i
was
quite
little
my
father
once
had
to
call
out
a
levy
against
the
west
welsh
and
then
there
was
great
cheering
as
the
men
started
there
was
none
now
only
the
loud
voice
of
the
thane
as
he
chided
loiterers
and
those
who
seemed
to
straggle
i
began
to
think
of
coming
down
when
the
last
had
gone
but
a
few
men
from
far
off
came
running
past
to
catch
them
up
and
i
kept
still
yet
then
a
great
longing
came
upon
me
to
join
the
levy
and
fight
the
danes
if
fight
there
should
be
and
i
began
to
plan
to
do
it
in
some
way
yet
could
not
see
how
to
disguise
myself
or
think
to
whose
company
to
pretend
to
belong
the
place
seemed
very
quiet
after
all
the
loud
talk
and
shouting
that
had
been
going
on
my
father
levy
had
had
ale
in
casks
and
food
brought
out
to
them
while
they
waited
but
i
had
seen
none
of
that
here
maybe
however
it
was
in
the
courtyard
i
thought
and
this
i
might
see
if
i
climbed
higher
above
the
palisading
so
i
left
my
sword
in
the
hollow
lest
it
should
hamper
me
and
went
up
a
big
branch
until
i
could
see
over
just
enough
to
look
across
to
the
great
gate
which
still
stood
open
then
i
forgot
all
about
that
which
had
made
me
curious
for
i
saw
two
figures
in
the
gateway
alswythe
stood
there
talking
with
my
friend
as
i
will
call
him
ever
the
old
housecarle
and
no
one
else
was
near
them
my
first
thought
was
to
come
down
and
run
to
her
but
i
remembered
that
i
could
but
see
one
corner
of
the
court
and
that
many
more
housecarles
might
be
at
hand
and
waited
not
daring
to
take
my
eyes
from
alswythe
lest
i
should
lose
her
they
were
too
far
off
for
me
to
hear
their
voices
nor
did
they
make
sign
or
movement
that
would
let
me
guess
that
which
they
spoke
of
but
presently
the
old
man
saluted
and
alswythe
went
out
of
the
gate
then
my
heart
leaped
within
me
for
i
thought
and
rightly
that
she
sought
her
bower
in
the
wood
and
so
she
passed
close
by
me
in
going
there
and
i
must
not
speak
or
move
for
fear
of
terrifying
her
but
when
she
had
gone
up
the
path
i
looked
round
carefully
once
or
twice
and
came
down
and
then
buckling
on
my
sword
again
looked
warily
out
of
the
thicket
and
seeing
that
none
was
near
crossed
the
open
and
followed
her
there
i
found
her
in
her
place
as
she
had
found
me
the
other
day
and
soon
once
more
we
were
side
by
side
on
the
old
seat
and
she
was
blaming
me
tenderly
for
my
rashness
yet
she
knew
not
that
it
was
i
who
had
brought
the
arrow
and
her
one
fear
was
that
i
had
joined
those
danes
and
when
i
looked
at
her
i
saw
that
she
had
been
sorely
troubled
and
this
was
the
cause
for
she
said
i
knew
that
you
my
heregar
would
not
fight
against
your
own
land
and
so
they
would
surely
slay
you
so
will
a
woman
see
the
truth
of
things
often
more
clearly
than
a
man
for
that
the
vikings
might
call
on
me
to
fight
my
saxon
kin
had
till
last
night
never
crossed
my
mind
yet
after
charnmouth
fight
it
was
like
enough
then
she
asked
what
brought
me
here
and
i
told
her
that
seeing
the
burning
of
watchet
i
had
a
mind
to
join
the
levy
if
i
could
and
so
fight
both
for
country
and
for
her
that
was
true
enough
as
my
thoughts
ran
now
and
surely
i
was
not
wrong
in
leaving
out
the
story
of
the
errand
with
the
war
arrow
for
that
would
have
told
her
of
her
lust
for
my
destruction
then
she
wept
lest
i
should
fall
but
being
brave
and
thoughtful
for
my
honour
and
for
my
winning
back
name
and
lands
bade
me
do
so
if
i
could
cheering
me
with
many
fond
and
noble
words
so
that
i
wondered
that
such
a
man
as
i
could
have
won
the
love
of
such
a
woman
as
she
now
the
time
was
all
too
short
for
me
to
tarry
long
but
before
i
went
alswythe
would
bring
me
out
food
and
drink
that
i
might
go
well
strengthened
and
provided
and
as
i
let
her
go
back
to
the
hall
i
asked
her
the
name
of
that
old
warrior
to
whom
she
spoke
for
it
was
he
i
told
her
who
had
tried
to
help
me
before
the
moot
and
then
i
was
sorry
i
had
told
her
that
for
she
might
ask
him
of
the
matter
and
hear
more
than
was
good
for
her
peace
of
mind
but
it
was
done
and
nothing
could
recall
it
yet
she
did
not
notice
it
then
but
said
his
name
was
wulfhere
and
that
he
was
a
stranger
from
glastonbury
as
she
thought
lately
come
into
her
father
service
she
was
going
then
and
i
asked
her
to
let
me
have
speech
with
him
as
i
thought
it
safe
if
he
were
to
be
trusted
for
i
needed
his
advice
in
some
things
she
said
she
would
sound
him
first
not
knowing
how
he
had
seen
me
already
of
course
and
so
went
quickly
away
towards
the
hall
what
i
needed
the
old
man
for
was
but
to
try
to
repair
my
slip
of
the
tongue
and
warn
him
of
my
love
ignorance
of
her
father
unfaith
to
me
but
as
it
fell
out
it
was
well
i
asked
to
see
him
presently
he
came
to
me
i
had
to
slip
into
the
bushes
and
lie
quiet
till
i
knew
who
it
was
and
when
i
came
out
he
smiled
gravely
at
me
shaking
his
head
yet
as
one
not
displeased
altogether
well
managed
master
he
said
still
smiling
but
i
knew
not
that
you
had
so
strong
a
rope
to
draw
you
hither
then
i
told
him
the
trouble
i
was
like
to
bring
on
alswythe
if
he
told
her
all
that
passed
at
brent
letting
him
have
his
own
thoughts
about
my
reason
for
coming
to
matelgar
hall
which
were
wrong
enough
though
natural
at
first
sight
maybe
he
promised
to
be
most
wary
and
i
was
content
then
i
asked
him
how
i
should
join
the
levy
master
he
said
very
gravely
this
is
like
to
be
a
matter
of
which
we
have
not
seen
the
end
yon
danes
are
up
channel
and
as
i
believe
lying
at
anchor
by
the
holms
it
will
not
be
their
way
if
having
gone
so
far
up
they
sack
not
every
town
on
their
way
they
are
beaten
off
on
their
first
landing
now
the
country
is
raised
against
them
sure
enough
but
our
levy
is
a
weak
crowd
when
it
is
first
raised
and
they
are
tried
warriors
every
one
now
they
may
go
on
up
tide
to
the
higher
towns
or
else
they
will
be
back
here
like
a
kite
on
a
chicken
before
men
think
and
bridgwater
town
will
see
a
great
fight
and
maybe
a
burning
before
tomorrow
then
i
said
that
the
levy
would
beat
them
off
easily
enough
but
the
old
warrior
shook
his
head
i
was
at
charnmouth
he
said
when
king
ethelwulf
himself
led
the
charge
and
our
men
fought
well
but
it
was
like
charging
a
wall
bristling
with
spears
again
and
again
our
men
charged
but
the
danes
stood
in
a
great
ring
which
never
broke
although
it
wavered
once
or
twice
until
we
were
wearied
out
and
then
they
swung
into
line
and
swept
us
off
the
field
until
we
learn
to
fight
as
they
fight
we
are
weaker
then
i
began
to
fear
for
alswythe
and
asked
him
what
guard
was
left
for
the
hall
and
again
he
shook
his
head
myself
and
five
others
not
the
strongest
and
a
dozen
women
and
three
boys
thralls
i
knew
not
what
to
say
to
this
but
the
wise
old
man
had
already
thought
of
a
plan
in
case
of
danger
and
in
this
he
said
i
could
advise
him
for
he
was
a
stranger
horses
enough
are
left
he
told
me
and
if
the
danes
come
to
bridgwater
and
are
not
beaten
off
i
shall
mount
the
lady
alswythe
and
the
women
and
take
them
to
a
safer
place
but
whither
i
told
him
at
once
of
the
house
of
a
great
thane
beyond
the
quantocks
easily
reached
by
safe
roads
through
the
forest
land
where
danes
would
not
care
to
follow
and
he
thanked
me
then
he
said
that
i
might
well
try
to
join
the
levy
but
that
it
was
possible
that
it
would
be
hard
for
me
and
i
told
him
that
if
i
could
not
manage
it
i
would
join
in
the
fight
when
no
man
would
question
me
and
that
seemed
possible
to
both
of
us
but
if
the
danes
yet
kept
away
i
knew
i
could
wait
in
hiding
having
money
now
safely
enough
till
they
had
gone
and
the
levy
dispersed
then
came
alswythe
back
bearing
with
her
the
things
i
needed
and
wulfhere
begged
her
not
to
bide
alone
in
the
wood
now
since
robbers
might
be
overbold
now
that
the
men
were
drawn
off
to
the
levy
that
was
good
advice
in
itself
but
i
knew
that
he
would
have
her
near
the
hall
lest
there
should
be
sudden
need
for
fleeing
she
promised
him
thanking
him
for
the
warning
and
he
left
us
then
she
tended
me
as
i
ate
carefully
and
never
had
there
been
for
me
so
sweet
a
meal
as
that
outlawed
and
homeless
though
i
was
to
the
world
for
her
word
was
my
law
now
and
my
home
was
all
in
her
love
for
me
i
think
no
man
can
rightly
be
held
an
outlaw
who
has
kept
law
and
has
home
such
as
that
for
while
he
has
and
loves
those
wrong
will
he
do
to
none
it
was
alswythe
who
bade
me
go
at
last
not
for
her
own
sake
but
for
mine
that
i
might
go
on
my
way
to
win
my
fair
name
back
again
chapter
vii
osric
the
sheriff
through
the
woods
i
reached
bridgwater
town
before
the
sun
set
and
looking
down
from
the
steep
hill
that
overhangs
the
houses
i
could
see
the
market
square
full
of
men
shining
in
arms
and
armour
and
noisy
enough
as
i
could
hear
but
every
one
of
the
townsfolk
knew
me
and
by
this
time
also
knew
what
had
befallen
me
so
that
as
i
stood
there
it
seemed
not
quite
so
easy
to
win
a
way
to
the
levy
as
before
the
highways
were
yet
full
of
men
coming
in
for
from
where
i
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
cover
i
could
see
the
bend
of
one
road
and
straight
down
another
if
i
went
on
them
i
must
walk
like
a
leper
alone
and
shunned
by
all
with
maybe
hard
words
to
hear
as
well
while
i
thought
of
all
this
there
crept
out
from
among
the
woods
an
old
crone
doubled
up
under
the
weight
of
a
faggot
of
dry
sticks
who
stayed
to
stare
at
me
i
did
not
mind
her
but
of
a
sudden
she
dropped
her
bundle
of
wood
and
i
saw
that
it
was
like
to
be
a
heavy
task
for
her
to
raise
it
again
so
i
turned
and
laid
hold
of
it
for
she
was
but
six
paces
from
me
saying
let
me
help
you
mother
to
get
it
hoisted
again
truly
would
i
carry
it
for
you
for
a
while
but
i
must
bide
here
that
must
you
heregar
the
outlaw
said
the
old
woman
coolly
without
a
word
of
thanks
and
i
thought
my
story
and
face
were
better
known
than
i
deemed
therefore
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
well
mother
said
i
you
know
me
and
if
you
know
me
so
also
must
many
others
but
i
want
to
join
the
levy
and
fight
if
need
be
thereby
knew
i
you
to
be
heregar
said
she
for
none
but
he
must
stand
here
with
the
light
of
battle
in
his
eyes
and
his
hand
clutched
on
his
sword
hilt
and
not
go
down
to
the
cross
yonder
as
the
summons
is
then
i
marvelled
at
the
old
dame
wisdom
though
maybe
it
was
but
a
guess
and
asked
her
what
i
should
do
seeing
that
she
was
wise
and
the
words
of
such
as
she
are
often
to
be
hearkened
to
it
is
a
wise
man
she
answered
who
will
take
advice
but
never
a
word
should
you
have
had
from
old
gundred
save
you
had
helped
her
as
a
true
man
should
truly
mother
gundred
i
said
i
have
no
rede
of
my
own
and
am
minded
to
take
yours
then
fool
she
said
curtly
link
up
that
tippet
of
mail
across
your
face
go
down
to
osric
the
sheriff
himself
beg
to
be
allowed
to
fight
and
see
what
he
will
tell
you
i
had
forgotten
that
i
could
hook
the
hanging
chain
mail
of
my
helmet
across
in
such
manner
that
little
but
my
eyes
could
be
seen
but
then
that
was
never
done
but
in
battle
and
i
had
never
seen
that
yet
thanks
mother
said
i
with
truth
for
i
saw
that
i
might
do
this
this
is
help
indeed
not
so
fast
young
sir
answered
the
crone
osric
will
not
have
you
how
know
you
that
how
does
an
old
woman
of
ninety
years
know
many
things
when
you
tell
me
that
i
will
say
how
i
know
that
osric
will
send
you
about
your
business
and
that
will
be
the
best
day
work
he
ever
did
now
i
was
nearly
angry
at
that
for
it
seemed
to
set
light
store
on
my
valour
but
there
seemed
something
more
in
the
old
woman
tone
than
her
taunting
words
would
convey
so
i
said
plainly
then
shall
i
go
to
him
aye
fool
did
i
not
tell
you
so
but
if
it
is
no
good
is
it
no
good
for
a
man
who
is
accused
of
disloyalty
to
have
witness
that
he
wished
at
least
to
spend
his
life
for
his
country
moreover
there
is
work
for
you
to
do
which
fighting
will
hinder
for
this
turn
go
to
heregar
i
will
tell
you
no
more
now
do
my
bidding
and
go
and
never
will
you
forget
that
you
helped
an
old
witch
with
her
burden
well
then
mother
i
said
hooking
up
the
mail
tippet
across
my
face
if
i
must
go
down
into
the
town
surely
i
will
carry
that
bundle
that
shall
you
not
she
answered
dropping
it
again
and
sitting
down
on
it
heregar
the
king
thane
the
standard
bearer
shall
bend
to
no
humbler
burden
than
the
dragon
of
wessex
go
and
thor
and
odin
strike
with
you
and
then
she
covered
up
her
face
and
would
look
no
more
at
me
i
thought
her
crazed
maybe
but
a
sort
of
chill
came
over
me
as
i
heard
her
name
the
old
heathen
gods
and
i
thought
of
the
valas
of
old
time
and
knew
how
here
and
there
some
of
the
old
worship
lingered
yet
however
good
advice
had
she
given
showing
me
the
way
to
try
my
fortune
in
the
way
i
wished
and
after
that
heathenish
blessing
i
had
no
mind
to
stay
longer
for
such
like
are
apt
to
prove
unlucky
so
i
bid
her
good
even
and
went
my
way
towards
the
town
after
all
i
thought
thane
i
was
once
and
may
be
again
and
to
bear
the
standard
must
be
won
by
valour
so
that
too
may
come
to
pass
whereupon
i
remembered
the
badger
that
scared
me
in
the
moonlight
and
was
less
confident
in
myself
many
were
the
questions
put
me
as
i
passed
into
the
marketplace
of
bridgwater
but
i
answered
none
pushing
on
to
where
i
saw
osric
the
sheriff
banner
over
a
great
house
mostly
the
men
scoffed
at
me
for
thinking
that
i
should
win
more
renown
in
disguise
but
some
thought
me
a
messenger
and
clustered
after
me
to
hear
what
they
might
when
i
came
to
the
house
door
where
osric
lay
it
was
guarded
and
the
guards
asked
me
my
business
i
said
i
would
see
the
sheriff
and
then
they
demanded
name
and
errand
now
i
could
give
neither
and
was
at
a
loss
for
a
moment
then
i
said
that
i
was
one
of
the
bearers
of
the
war
arrow
and
though
that
was
but
a
chance
shot
as
it
were
it
passed
me
in
at
once
for
often
a
bearer
would
return
to
give
account
of
some
thane
ill
or
absent
or
the
like
they
took
me
to
a
great
hall
where
sat
many
thanes
along
great
tables
eating
and
drinking
and
at
the
highest
seat
was
osric
and
next
him
matelgar
this
assembly
and
most
of
all
that
my
enemy
should
be
present
was
against
me
in
making
my
plea
but
as
the
old
crone
had
said
i
should
be
no
loser
by
witness
i
waited
till
a
thrall
had
told
osric
that
one
of
his
messengers
was
here
and
then
they
beckoned
me
to
go
to
him
he
shifted
round
in
his
chair
to
speak
to
me
but
i
was
watching
matelgar
and
saw
his
glance
light
on
my
sword
hilt
recognizing
it
he
grew
pale
and
then
red
from
his
seat
to
speak
to
osric
but
thinking
better
thereof
well
what
news
and
whence
said
the
sheriff
who
was
a
small
wiry
man
with
a
sour
look
as
i
thought
men
spoke
well
of
him
though
the
danes
lie
off
the
holms
sir
i
said
for
i
would
gain
time
i
know
that
he
answered
testily
pull
that
mail
off
your
face
man
they
are
not
here
yet
and
your
voice
is
muffled
behind
it
i
suppose
that
the
coming
and
going
of
messengers
was
constant
and
indeed
there
came
another
even
then
so
the
other
thanes
paid
little
attention
after
they
heard
my
stale
news
except
matelgar
who
went
on
watching
me
closely
i
was
just
about
to
ask
the
sheriff
to
hear
me
privately
when
matelgar
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
having
made
up
his
mind
at
last
and
drawing
him
down
a
little
spoke
to
him
a
few
words
among
which
i
caught
my
own
name
the
sheriff
looked
sharply
at
me
twitching
his
sleeve
away
and
i
saw
that
there
was
to
be
no
more
concealment
so
i
dropped
the
tippet
and
let
him
see
who
i
was
saying
at
the
same
time
safe
conduct
i
crave
osric
the
sheriff
then
a
silence
came
over
the
thanes
who
saw
and
knew
me
looking
up
to
see
what
this
new
freak
of
mine
was
and
osric
frowned
at
me
but
said
nothing
so
i
spoke
first
outlaw
i
am
osric
but
i
can
fight
today
i
bore
the
war
arrow
that
one
who
neither
knew
nor
believed
me
gave
me
faithfully
to
matelgar
the
thane
who
is
here
in
obedience
to
that
summons
and
when
i
took
it
i
was
on
my
way
out
of
the
kingdom
as
i
was
bidden
but
i
turned
back
because
of
the
need
for
a
trusty
messenger
now
i
ask
only
to
be
allowed
to
fight
alongside
your
men
in
this
levy
and
after
that
it
is
over
if
i
live
i
will
go
my
way
again
that
was
all
i
had
to
say
and
when
i
ceased
a
talk
buzzed
up
among
the
thanes
but
matelgar
looked
black
and
osric
made
no
answer
frowning
indeed
but
more
i
think
at
the
doubt
he
was
in
than
with
anger
at
me
i
saw
that
matelgar
longed
to
speak
but
dared
not
as
yet
and
then
he
cast
his
eye
down
the
hall
and
seemed
to
make
some
sign
presently
osric
said
in
a
doubtful
way
never
heard
i
the
like
now
i
myself
know
not
why
an
outlaw
should
not
fight
if
he
wills
to
do
so
what
say
you
thanes
he
cried
loudly
turning
to
those
down
the
hall
instantly
one
rose
up
and
shouted
we
will
have
no
traitors
in
our
ranks
then
i
knew
what
matelgar
sign
meant
for
this
was
a
close
friend
of
his
on
that
too
several
others
said
the
same
and
one
cried
that
i
should
be
hounded
out
of
the
hall
and
town
osric
frowned
when
he
heard
that
and
looked
at
me
but
i
stood
with
my
arms
folded
lest
i
should
be
tempted
to
lay
hand
on
sword
and
so
give
my
enemies
a
hold
on
me
matelgar
himself
said
nothing
as
keeping
up
his
part
of
friend
bound
by
loyalty
to
accuse
me
against
his
will
as
for
the
other
thanes
they
talked
but
all
the
outcry
was
against
my
being
allowed
to
join
and
at
last
osric
seemed
to
be
overborne
by
them
for
voices
in
my
favour
were
few
heard
if
many
thought
little
harm
of
my
request
but
then
the
offer
of
the
help
of
one
man
was
anyway
a
little
thing
and
if
he
were
doubted
it
would
be
and
i
could
see
as
osric
would
also
see
that
the
matter
would
be
spread
through
the
levy
by
those
against
me
now
as
i
thought
of
the
likelihood
of
one
of
matelgar
men
spearing
me
during
the
heat
of
fight
i
wondered
if
he
feared
the
same
of
me
for
i
have
often
heard
tales
of
the
like
then
osric
answered
me
kindly
enough
but
decidedly
nay
heregar
you
hear
that
this
must
not
be
outlaw
is
outlaw
and
must
count
for
naught
i
may
not
go
against
the
word
of
the
moot
and
inlaw
you
again
by
giving
you
a
place
go
hence
in
peace
and
take
your
way
yet
we
thank
you
for
bearing
the
message
to
matelgar
link
up
your
mail
again
and
tell
any
man
that
you
bear
messages
from
me
the
watchword
is
for
the
guards
are
set
by
now
and
you
will
need
it
as
he
spoke
thus
kindly
matelgar
face
grew
black
as
night
but
he
dared
say
no
word
so
i
bowed
to
the
sheriff
and
linking
up
my
mail
went
sadly
enough
down
the
hall
it
was
crowded
at
one
place
and
there
some
friendly
hand
patted
me
softly
on
the
shoulder
though
most
shrank
from
me
but
yet
i
would
not
turn
to
see
who
it
was
that
helped
me
now
i
have
often
wondered
that
no
inquiry
was
made
about
my
arms
and
how
i
came
by
them
but
what
i
believe
is
that
even
then
men
began
to
know
that
matelgar
and
his
friends
had
played
me
false
but
that
they
would
not
and
matelgar
people
dared
not
say
much
as
for
osric
his
mind
was
full
of
greater
troubles
and
i
suppose
he
never
thought
thereof
i
passed
out
into
the
street
but
now
it
was
falling
dark
and
few
noticed
me
the
men
sat
about
along
the
house
walls
on
settles
eating
and
drinking
and
singing
and
i
coming
to
a
dark
place
sat
down
among
a
few
and
ate
and
drank
as
well
for
half
an
hour
and
then
passing
the
guards
at
the
entrance
to
the
town
on
the
road
to
cannington
struck
out
for
stert
that
i
might
be
near
alswythe
and
wait
for
the
possible
coming
of
the
danes
and
the
battle
in
which
i
might
join
chapter
viii
the
fires
of
stert
i
went
along
the
highroad
now
for
it
was
dark
and
few
were
about
only
now
and
then
i
met
a
little
party
of
men
hurrying
to
the
gathering
place
and
mostly
they
spoke
to
me
asking
for
news
and
from
them
i
learned
too
that
nothing
had
been
seen
while
daylight
served
of
the
danes
once
i
had
to
say
i
was
on
osric
errand
as
he
bade
me
being
questioned
as
to
why
i
was
heading
away
from
the
town
i
could
not
see
my
hall
as
i
passed
close
by
its
place
for
the
lights
that
ever
shone
thence
in
the
old
days
so
lately
yet
seeming
so
long
gone
were
quenched
but
i
thought
of
a
safe
place
whence
to
watch
if
the
danes
came
where
were
trees
in
which
i
might
hide
if
need
were
as
i
had
hidden
this
morning
this
was
on
the
little
spur
of
hill
men
call
by
the
name
of
the
fisher
village
below
it
combwich
it
looked
on
all
the
windings
of
parret
river
and
there
would
i
soon
know
if
landing
was
to
be
made
for
attack
on
bridgwater
but
i
thought
it
likely
that
there
would
be
an
outpost
of
our
men
there
for
the
same
reason
and
going
thither
went
carefully
sure
enough
there
was
a
little
watchfire
and
half
a
dozen
men
round
it
on
the
best
outlook
and
so
i
passed
on
still
further
following
round
the
spur
of
hill
till
i
came
to
where
the
land
overlooks
the
whole
long
tongue
of
stert
point
that
would
do
as
well
for
me
i
thought
and
choosing
as
best
i
could
in
the
dark
a
tree
into
which
i
knew
by
remembrance
that
i
might
easily
get
i
sat
down
at
its
foot
looking
seaward
now
by
this
time
the
tide
which
runs
very
strong
and
swiftly
must
be
flowing
again
and
i
thought
that
most
likely
the
danes
having
anchored
during
the
ebb
would
go
on
up
channel
with
it
and
that
therefore
i
might
have
to
hang
about
here
for
days
before
they
landed
even
were
they
to
land
at
all
and
this
i
had
heard
said
many
times
by
the
men
of
the
levy
some
indeed
saying
that
they
might
as
well
go
home
again
but
i
should
do
as
well
here
as
anywhere
or
better
since
while
matelgar
was
away
i
might
yet
see
alswythe
again
though
that
after
my
repulse
by
the
sheriff
or
perhaps
i
should
rather
say
by
his
advisers
i
thought
not
of
trying
yet
it
would
but
be
another
parting
still
i
might
find
old
wulfhere
and
send
her
messages
by
him
before
setting
out
westward
again
almost
was
i
dozing
for
the
day
had
been
very
long
when
from
close
to
stert
came
that
which
roused
me
completely
setting
my
heart
beating
it
was
a
bright
flash
of
light
from
close
inshore
on
the
severn
side
of
the
tongue
followed
by
answering
flashes
just
as
i
had
seen
them
at
watchet
but
now
the
flashes
came
and
went
out
instantly
for
i
was
no
longer
looking
down
on
the
ship
decks
as
then
well
was
it
that
i
had
seen
this
before
from
quantock
heights
for
i
knew
that
once
again
the
danes
were
landing
and
that
the
peril
was
close
at
hand
then
at
once
i
knew
the
terrible
danger
of
alswythe
for
matelgar
was
the
first
hall
that
would
be
burnt
my
first
thought
was
to
hasten
thither
and
alarm
wulfhere
and
then
to
hurry
back
to
that
outpost
i
had
passed
half
a
mile
away
for
the
country
danger
must
be
thought
of
too
then
a
better
thought
than
either
came
to
me
if
it
was
as
it
must
be
barely
half
tide
the
danes
would
find
mud
between
them
and
shore
too
deep
to
cross
and
must
wait
till
the
ships
could
come
up
to
land
or
until
there
was
water
enough
to
float
their
boats
i
had
an
hour
or
more
yet
before
they
set
foot
on
shore
moreover
i
would
find
out
if
landing
was
indeed
meant
or
if
these
were
but
signals
for
keeping
channel
on
the
outward
course
so
across
the
level
meadows
of
stert
i
ran
my
best
right
towards
the
place
where
i
had
seen
the
light
which
was
at
the
top
as
it
were
of
the
wedge
that
stert
makes
between
the
waters
of
parret
and
the
greater
severn
sea
there
are
high
banks
along
the
shore
to
keep
out
the
spring
tides
and
under
these
i
could
watch
in
safety
unseen
three
huts
were
there
only
but
these
i
knew
would
be
deserted
for
fear
of
the
danes
so
i
found
them
and
then
creeping
up
the
bank
i
stood
still
and
peered
out
into
the
darkness
yet
it
was
not
so
dark
on
the
water
which
gleamed
a
little
in
the
tide
swirls
here
and
there
beyond
half
a
mile
of
mud
black
as
pitch
in
contrast
but
that
i
could
make
out
at
last
six
long
black
ships
lying
as
it
seemed
on
the
edge
of
the
ooze
and
i
could
hear
too
hoarse
voices
crying
out
on
board
of
them
and
now
and
then
the
rattle
of
anchor
chains
or
the
like
when
the
wind
blew
from
them
to
me
and
ever
those
ships
crept
nearer
to
me
so
that
i
knew
they
were
edging
up
to
the
land
as
the
tide
rose
that
learnt
i
knew
what
to
do
i
ran
to
the
nearest
fishers
hut
and
pulled
handfuls
of
the
thatch
from
under
the
eaves
piling
it
to
windward
against
the
wooden
walls
then
i
fired
the
heap
and
it
blazed
up
bright
and
strong
and
at
once
came
a
great
howl
of
rage
from
the
ships
plain
to
be
heard
for
they
knew
that
now
they
might
not
land
unknown
so
had
i
warned
osric
the
sheriff
and
that
matter
was
out
of
my
hands
and
moreover
wulfhere
being
an
old
and
tried
warrior
would
be
warned
as
well
that
however
i
would
see
to
myself
and
if
i
could
i
would
aid
him
in
getting
alswythe
into
a
place
of
safety
so
i
ran
back
bending
my
steps
now
towards
her
father
hall
up
the
roadway
if
one
might
so
call
the
track
through
the
marshland
that
led
thither
just
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
met
three
men
of
the
outpost
who
were
hurrying
down
to
see
what
my
fire
meant
they
challenged
me
halting
with
levelled
spears
across
the
track
then
was
i
glad
of
the
password
and
answered
by
giving
it
right
said
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
what
news
i
told
him
quickly
bidding
him
waste
no
time
but
hurry
back
and
tell
the
sheriff
that
the
danes
would
be
ashore
in
half
an
hour
i
spoke
as
i
was
wont
to
speak
when
i
was
a
thane
forgetting
in
the
dire
need
of
the
moment
that
i
was
an
outlaw
now
and
the
man
was
offended
thereat
who
are
you
to
command
me
thus
he
said
shortly
heregar
the
thane
of
cannington
said
i
still
only
anxious
that
he
should
go
quickly
heard
one
ever
the
like
said
the
man
and
then
i
remembered
i
looked
round
at
my
fire
two
huts
were
burning
now
very
brightly
for
the
wind
fanned
the
flames
saw
you
ever
the
like
i
said
and
pointed
now
will
you
go
the
bright
light
shone
on
a
row
of
flashing
gilded
dragon
heads
on
the
ships
stems
on
lines
of
starlike
specks
beyond
them
which
were
helms
and
mail
coats
and
on
lines
again
of
smaller
stars
above
which
were
spear
points
holy
saints
cried
the
man
adding
a
greater
oath
yet
be
you
heregar
the
outlaw
or
no
truth
you
tell
and
well
have
you
done
let
us
begone
men
and
with
that
those
three
leapt
away
into
the
darkness
up
the
hill
leaving
me
to
follow
if
i
listed
that
was
not
my
way
however
and
i
ran
on
to
matelgar
hall
one
stood
at
the
gate
it
was
wulfhere
inside
i
heard
the
trampling
of
horses
and
knew
that
they
would
be
ready
in
time
wulfhere
laid
hand
on
sword
as
i
came
up
doubting
if
i
were
not
a
dane
but
i
cried
to
him
who
i
was
and
he
came
out
a
step
or
two
to
me
asking
for
news
and
when
i
told
him
what
i
had
seen
and
done
he
too
said
i
had
done
well
and
that
i
had
saved
alswythe
if
not
many
more
also
that
he
had
sent
a
man
to
tell
matelgar
of
his
plans
then
he
told
me
that
even
now
the
horses
were
ready
and
that
he
was
about
to
abandon
the
place
going
to
the
house
of
that
thane
of
whom
i
had
told
him
and
i
said
that
i
would
go
some
way
with
him
and
then
return
to
join
the
levy
making
known
my
with
osric
ho
said
he
it
was
well
he
sent
you
away
as
it
seems
to
me
that
was
the
word
of
the
old
crone
i
remembered
that
it
should
be
so
then
came
a
soft
touch
on
my
arm
and
on
turning
i
saw
alswythe
standing
by
me
wrapped
in
a
long
cloak
and
ready
and
neither
i
nor
she
thought
shame
that
i
should
lay
my
arm
round
her
and
kiss
her
there
with
the
grim
old
housecarle
standing
by
and
pretending
to
look
out
over
stert
where
the
light
of
my
fires
shone
above
the
trees
heregar
my
loved
one
what
does
it
all
mean
she
said
trembling
a
little
have
they
come
i
folded
my
arm
more
closely
round
her
and
would
have
answered
but
that
wulfhere
did
so
for
me
aye
lady
and
it
is
to
heregar
that
we
owe
our
safety
for
he
has
been
down
to
stert
and
warned
us
all
at
that
my
love
crept
closer
to
me
as
it
were
to
thank
me
then
she
said
will
there
be
fighting
and
will
my
father
have
to
fight
aye
lady
said
wulfhere
again
as
a
good
saxon
should
must
i
go
from
here
she
asked
again
and
i
told
her
that
the
house
would
be
burnt
maybe
in
an
hour
or
so
at
that
she
shivered
and
tried
not
to
weep
being
very
brave
where
must
we
go
she
said
with
a
little
tremble
in
her
voice
i
told
her
where
we
would
take
her
and
then
she
cried
out
that
she
must
bide
near
at
hand
lest
her
father
should
be
hurt
and
none
to
tend
him
and
wulfhere
and
i
tried
a
little
to
overpersuade
her
but
then
a
groom
came
to
say
that
all
was
ready
and
truly
no
time
must
be
lost
if
we
would
get
off
safely
then
i
said
that
it
would
be
safe
to
go
to
bridgwater
for
then
we
should
be
behind
the
levy
and
that
the
danes
must
cut
through
that
before
reaching
us
and
to
that
wulfhere
agreed
for
i
knew
he
would
rather
be
swinging
his
sword
against
the
danes
at
stert
than
flying
through
the
woods
of
the
quantocks
alswythe
thanked
me
without
words
indeed
and
then
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
mounted
and
we
were
going
up
towards
the
high
road
to
bridgwater
we
had
twelve
horses
and
on
them
were
the
women
of
the
house
bearing
what
valuables
they
might
as
wulfhere
had
bade
them
one
horse
carried
two
women
but
they
were
a
light
burden
and
we
had
no
such
terrible
haste
to
make
seeing
that
every
moment
brought
us
nearer
the
levy
there
were
the
men
and
boys
as
well
but
they
led
the
beasts
now
when
we
reached
the
high
road
some
half
mile
away
suddenly
alswythe
reined
up
her
horse
by
which
i
walked
giving
a
little
cry
and
i
asked
what
it
was
then
she
said
sobbing
a
little
that
she
would
her
cows
were
driven
out
into
the
forest
where
they
were
wont
to
feed
lest
the
cruel
danes
should
get
them
and
to
please
her
i
think
i
should
myself
have
gone
back
but
that
wulfhere
called
one
of
the
men
who
it
seemed
was
the
cowherd
bidding
him
return
and
do
this
if
the
danes
were
not
coming
yet
glad
enough
was
i
to
hear
the
man
say
that
he
had
done
it
already
for
no
dane
should
grow
fat
on
beasts
of
his
tending
and
they
were
a
mile
off
by
now
so
we
went
on
and
every
minute
i
looked
to
meet
our
levy
advancing
but
the
moon
rose
and
shone
on
no
line
of
glancing
armour
that
i
longed
for
and
wulfhere
growled
to
himself
as
he
went
i
would
have
asked
him
many
questions
but
would
not
leave
alswythe
lest
she
should
be
alarmed
and
all
the
way
as
we
went
i
told
her
of
what
had
befallen
me
with
osric
saying
only
that
her
father
was
there
but
had
not
been
able
to
speak
for
me
and
i
told
her
of
the
old
crone
words
which
she
thought
would
surely
come
true
all
of
them
as
they
had
begun
to
do
so
it
is
a
long
five
miles
from
matelgar
place
to
the
town
and
we
could
only
travel
at
a
foot
pace
but
still
we
met
no
force
indeed
until
we
were
just
a
half
mile
thence
we
saw
no
one
then
we
met
a
picket
who
seeing
we
were
fugitives
let
us
go
on
unchallenged
but
wulfhere
stopped
and
questioned
the
men
and
got
no
pleasant
answer
as
it
seemed
for
he
caught
us
up
growling
coming
alongside
of
me
and
saying
for
alswythe
could
not
know
the
ways
of
war
that
they
would
attack
with
morning
light
but
i
felt
only
too
keenly
though
i
knew
so
little
that
to
fight
the
danes
when
they
had
their
foot
firmly
ashore
was
a
harder
matter
than
to
meet
them
but
just
landed
we
were
so
close
to
the
town
now
that
i
asked
alswythe
where
she
would
be
taken
already
we
were
passing
groups
of
fugitives
from
the
nearer
country
and
the
town
would
be
full
of
them
to
say
nothing
of
the
men
of
the
levy
she
thought
a
little
and
then
asked
me
if
she
might
not
go
to
her
father
wherever
he
was
but
i
told
her
that
he
was
but
a
guest
of
osric
as
it
seemed
then
she
said
that
she
would
go
to
her
aunt
who
was
the
prioress
of
the
white
nuns
and
bide
in
the
nunnery
walls
till
all
was
safe
and
that
seemed
a
good
plan
both
to
me
and
wulfhere
for
it
would
though
this
we
said
not
to
alswythe
set
us
free
to
fight
as
there
we
might
not
come
and
she
would
be
safe
without
us
then
i
told
wulfhere
how
we
could
reach
that
house
without
going
through
the
crowded
town
and
so
turned
to
the
right
skirting
round
in
the
quiet
lanes
the
gray
dawn
began
to
break
as
we
saw
the
nunnery
before
us
and
it
was
very
cold
but
alswythe
pointed
to
a
crimson
glow
behind
us
as
we
topped
the
last
rise
saying
that
the
sun
would
be
up
soon
wulfhere
and
i
looked
at
each
other
that
glow
was
not
in
the
east
but
shone
from
matelgar
hall
in
flames
and
then
we
feigned
cheerfulness
and
said
that
it
would
be
so
and
alswythe
smiled
on
me
though
she
was
pale
and
overwrought
with
the
terror
she
would
not
show
and
the
long
dark
and
cold
journey
we
came
to
the
nunnery
gate
and
knocked
and
the
old
portress
looked
out
of
the
wicket
and
asked
our
business
frightened
at
the
glint
of
mail
she
saw
but
alswythe
voice
she
knew
well
as
she
answered
begging
lodging
for
herself
and
her
maidens
till
this
trouble
was
over
it
was
no
new
thing
for
a
lady
of
rank
to
come
into
that
quiet
retreat
with
her
train
when
on
a
journey
and
after
a
little
time
while
the
portress
told
the
prioress
the
doors
were
thrown
open
and
we
rode
into
the
great
courtyard
where
torches
burnt
in
the
dim
gray
morning
light
then
came
the
prioress
mother
sister
to
alswythe
a
tall
and
lady
greeting
her
and
us
kindly
and
so
promising
safe
tending
to
her
niece
so
long
as
she
needed
here
alswythe
must
part
from
me
giving
me
but
her
hand
to
kiss
as
also
to
wulfhere
but
there
was
a
warm
pressure
on
my
hand
for
myself
alone
that
bided
with
me
and
the
prioress
thanked
us
for
our
care
not
knowing
me
in
the
half
light
and
in
mail
and
so
were
we
left
in
the
courtyard
where
an
old
lay
brother
brought
from
the
near
monastery
showed
us
the
stabling
and
provender
for
our
horses
and
the
loft
where
the
men
should
sleep
outside
the
walls
of
the
inclosed
building
here
wulfhere
bade
the
men
and
boys
remain
tending
their
horses
until
he
should
return
or
until
orders
came
from
their
master
himself
or
from
the
lady
alswythe
for
they
were
thralls
and
not
men
who
should
be
with
the
levy
then
he
and
i
went
out
into
the
roadway
and
walked
away
until
we
were
alone
what
now
i
asked
i
must
join
my
master
telling
him
what
i
have
done
and
that
the
lady
is
safe
so
shall
i
march
with
the
rest
most
likely
what
shall
i
say
of
your
part
in
this
nought
i
answered
maybe
that
is
best
just
now
he
agreed
we
had
come
to
the
town
streets
now
and
they
seemed
empty
the
light
was
strong
enough
by
this
time
and
there
came
a
sound
of
shouting
from
the
place
of
the
market
cross
and
then
we
heard
the
bray
of
war
horns
and
wulfhere
quickened
his
pace
saying
that
the
men
were
mustering
or
maybe
on
the
march
then
i
longed
to
go
with
him
but
that
might
not
be
so
i
left
him
at
last
saying
that
i
should
surely
join
in
the
fight
i
had
not
gone
six
paces
from
him
when
he
called
me
and
i
could
see
that
he
looked
anxious
master
he
said
this
is
going
to
be
a
doubtful
fight
as
it
seems
to
me
yon
danes
know
that
the
country
is
raised
but
yet
they
have
come
back
and
they
mean
to
fight
now
our
levy
is
raw
and
has
no
discipline
and
i
doubt
it
will
be
as
it
was
at
charnmouth
if
that
is
so
bridgwater
will
be
no
safe
place
for
the
lady
alswythe
she
must
be
got
hence
with
all
speed
shall
you
not
return
and
hide
with
her
i
asked
that
is
as
the
master
bids
said
he
and
then
he
added
looking
at
me
doubtfully
i
would
you
were
not
so
bent
on
this
fight
then
was
i
torn
two
ways
by
my
longing
to
strike
a
blow
for
wessex
and
by
my
love
for
my
alswythe
and
care
for
her
safety
and
i
knew
not
what
to
say
wulfhere
understood
my
silence
and
then
decided
for
me
you
have
hearkened
to
me
before
master
and
now
i
will
speak
again
get
you
to
your
place
of
last
night
on
combwich
hill
and
there
look
on
the
fight
or
if
it
be
nearer
this
find
such
a
place
as
you
know
then
if
there
is
victory
for
us
all
is
well
but
if
not
you
could
not
aid
with
your
one
strength
to
regain
it
then
will
alswythe
need
you
i
would
fain
fight
i
said
still
doubting
aye
master
but
already
have
you
done
well
and
deserved
well
of
the
sheriff
and
of
all
he
bade
you
fight
not
today
let
it
be
so
there
is
loyalty
also
in
obedience
and
ever
must
some
bide
with
the
things
one
holds
dear
i
will
do
as
you
say
said
i
shortly
and
so
i
turned
and
went
he
stood
and
looked
after
me
for
a
little
and
then
he
too
hurried
away
towards
the
cross
then
i
skirted
round
the
town
and
waited
at
that
place
where
i
had
met
with
the
old
woman
until
i
saw
the
van
of
our
forces
marching
down
the
road
towards
cannington
these
i
kept
up
with
by
hurrying
from
point
to
point
alongside
the
road
as
best
i
might
they
were
a
gallant
show
to
look
on
gay
with
banners
and
bright
armour
yet
i
had
heard
of
the
ways
of
armies
and
thought
to
see
them
marching
in
close
order
and
in
silence
but
they
were
in
a
long
line
with
many
gaps
and
here
and
there
the
mounted
thanes
rode
to
and
fro
seemingly
trying
to
make
them
close
up
and
they
sang
and
shouted
as
they
went
when
we
came
to
the
steep
rise
of
cannington
hill
some
of
those
thanes
spurred
on
and
rode
to
the
summit
and
there
waited
a
little
till
the
men
joined
them
there
was
silence
and
a
closing
up
as
they
breasted
the
steep
pitch
and
then
i
must
go
through
woods
and
so
lost
sight
of
them
for
a
while
i
passed
close
to
my
own
hall
closed
and
deserted
every
soul
in
all
the
countryside
had
fled
into
the
town
though
after
the
levy
came
a
great
mixed
crowd
of
thralls
and
the
like
to
see
the
fray
now
here
i
thought
to
cross
in
the
rear
of
the
force
that
i
might
reach
combwich
hill
but
that
was
not
to
be
when
i
saw
the
array
again
it
was
halted
and
the
men
were
closing
up
and
between
the
levy
and
that
crowd
of
followers
was
a
great
gap
and
some
of
these
last
were
making
for
the
shelter
of
swamp
and
wood
i
myself
was
on
a
little
rise
of
heathy
land
and
could
see
plainly
before
me
the
road
going
up
over
the
neck
of
combwich
hill
in
the
notch
there
is
there
where
the
ascent
is
easiest
and
that
road
was
barred
halfway
up
the
hillside
by
a
company
on
which
the
sun
shone
brightly
showing
scarlet
cloaks
and
gilded
helms
not
only
on
the
roadway
but
flanking
the
hills
on
either
side
these
were
the
danes
and
behind
them
over
the
hill
rose
the
smoke
from
matelgar
burnt
home
even
as
i
looked
a
great
roar
of
defiance
came
from
our
men
but
the
danes
made
no
answer
standing
still
and
silent
and
that
seemed
terrible
to
me
so
for
a
moment
they
stood
and
then
as
at
some
signal
from
them
broke
out
that
deep
chant
with
its
terrible
swinging
melody
that
had
come
faintly
to
me
from
watchet
haven
then
our
men
rushed
forward
and
even
where
i
stood
i
could
hear
the
crash
of
arms
on
shields
as
the
lines
met
the
ringing
of
the
chime
of
war
and
our
men
fought
uphill
and
now
it
needed
all
my
force
to
keep
myself
for
alswythe
sake
from
joining
in
that
fray
and
presently
when
i
would
take
my
hand
from
my
sword
hilt
it
was
stiff
and
cramped
from
clutching
hard
upon
it
as
i
watched
those
two
lines
swaying
and
heard
the
yells
of
the
fighters
and
indeed
i
should
surely
have
joined
but
there
came
a
voice
to
me
bide
here
in
patience
heregar
the
king
thane
there
is
work
for
you
yet
that
fighting
will
hinder
and
the
old
crone
gundred
who
had
come
i
know
not
how
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
look
at
the
tide
heregar
look
at
the
tide
she
said
pointing
to
parret
river
where
the
mud
banks
lay
bare
and
glistening
with
the
falling
water
let
them
drive
these
danes
back
to
their
stranded
ships
and
how
many
will
go
home
again
to
denmark
think
you
and
i
prayed
that
this
might
be
so
for
i
knew
she
spoke
truth
if
they
might
not
reach
their
ships
and
became
penned
in
on
stert
they
were
lost
every
one
for
none
might
cross
the
deep
ooze
not
this
time
heregar
remember
when
the
time
comes
she
said
and
i
paid
no
heed
to
her
for
now
horses
were
galloping
riderless
along
the
road
and
into
the
fields
and
men
were
crawling
back
from
the
fight
to
fall
exhausted
in
the
rear
and
then
then
the
steadfast
line
of
the
danes
charged
down
the
hill
driving
our
men
like
sheep
before
them
up
and
to
your
work
said
the
crone
pointing
towards
bridgwater
and
i
who
had
already
made
two
steps
with
drawn
sword
towards
that
broken
flying
rabble
remembered
alswythe
and
turned
away
groaning
to
hasten
to
her
rescue
for
it
was
as
wulfhere
had
said
all
that
i
could
do
swiftly
i
went
turning
neither
to
right
nor
left
along
the
road
hearing
always
behind
me
the
cries
of
those
who
fled
and
the
savage
shouts
of
the
pursuing
vikings
i
was
in
the
midst
of
that
crowd
of
thralls
once
but
they
thinned
taking
to
the
woods
whence
i
had
come
while
i
kept
on
then
i
saw
one
of
those
horses
a
great
white
steed
standing
snorting
by
the
wayside
where
he
had
stopped
and
i
spoke
to
him
and
he
let
me
catch
and
mount
him
and
so
i
rode
on
yet
when
i
came
to
the
top
of
cannington
hill
i
looked
back
all
the
road
was
full
of
our
men
flying
and
a
thought
came
into
my
head
and
i
dared
to
draw
rein
and
wait
for
them
linking
my
mail
again
across
my
face
they
came
up
panting
and
wild
with
panic
and
there
with
voice
and
hand
i
bade
them
stand
on
that
vantage
ground
and
block
the
way
against
the
danes
bidding
them
remember
the
helpless
ones
in
the
town
who
must
have
time
to
fly
and
how
the
danes
must
needs
shrink
from
a
second
fight
after
hot
pursuit
and
there
is
that
in
a
saxon
stubborn
heart
which
bade
them
heed
me
and
there
they
formed
up
again
wild
with
rage
and
desperate
and
the
line
grew
thicker
and
firmer
as
more
came
up
with
the
sheriff
himself
till
the
foremost
pursuing
danes
recoiled
and
some
were
slain
and
i
knew
that
the
flight
was
over
then
i
slipped
from
my
horse
and
made
my
way
on
foot
lest
men
should
notice
my
going
but
the
horse
followed
me
and
soon
i
mounted
him
again
and
galloped
on
then
i
found
that
though
i
had
not
noticed
it
my
mail
had
fallen
apart
but
i
knew
not
if
any
had
known
me
or
even
had
noted
who
i
might
be
so
i
came
to
bridgwater
bringing
terror
with
me
as
men
gathered
what
had
befallen
from
my
haste
yet
i
stayed
for
none
but
went
on
to
the
nunnery
chapter
ix
in
bridgwater
two
of
wulfhere
men
were
by
the
gate
lounging
against
the
sunny
wall
but
they
roused
into
life
as
they
heard
the
clatter
of
my
horse
hoofs
and
came
to
meet
me
and
take
the
bridle
as
was
their
duty
they
knew
who
i
was
well
enough
but
thralls
may
not
question
the
ways
of
a
thane
as
i
was
yet
in
their
eyes
though
outlawed
yet
they
asked
me
for
news
of
the
fight
and
i
told
them
lest
they
should
raise
a
panic
or
maybe
leave
us
themselves
only
that
our
men
stood
against
the
danes
on
cannington
hill
and
that
beyond
them
the
invaders
could
not
come
and
that
satisfied
them
i
was
doubtful
whether
to
go
in
at
once
and
seek
audience
with
the
prioress
or
wait
until
some
fresh
news
came
in
for
now
i
began
to
have
a
hope
that
our
men
would
sweep
down
the
hill
on
the
danes
and
scatter
them
in
turn
even
as
they
had
themselves
been
overborne
so
for
half
an
hour
i
waited
pacing
the
road
before
the
nunnery
while
i
bade
the
men
see
to
my
horse
but
the
place
was
very
quiet
being
on
that
side
the
town
away
from
the
fight
so
that
any
coming
thence
would
stay
their
flight
when
the
shelter
of
the
houses
was
reached
at
last
came
one
running
at
a
steady
pace
and
i
sprang
to
meet
him
for
it
was
wulfhere
his
face
was
hard
and
set
his
armour
was
covered
with
blood
and
he
had
a
bandage
round
his
head
instead
of
helmet
but
he
was
not
hurt
much
as
one
might
see
by
the
way
he
came
he
grasped
my
hand
without
a
word
and
threw
himself
on
the
bank
by
the
road
side
to
get
breath
and
i
stood
by
him
silent
for
a
while
heregar
he
said
at
last
it
is
well
for
bridgwater
town
and
these
here
in
this
nunnery
that
you
obeyed
and
fought
not
wherefore
i
said
must
we
fly
i
saw
you
rally
the
men
on
cannington
hill
and
that
was
the
best
thing
done
in
all
this
evil
day
then
i
asked
do
they
yet
stand
aye
for
the
danes
have
drawn
off
and
our
men
bar
the
way
here
i
told
him
what
i
had
hoped
from
a
charge
of
our
levy
but
he
shook
his
head
and
told
me
that
even
had
our
men
the
skill
to
see
their
advantage
the
danes
had
formed
up
again
on
seeing
that
this
might
be
and
had
gone
back
in
good
order
to
their
first
post
at
combwich
but
our
levy
will
not
bide
a
second
fight
he
said
sadly
already
the
men
are
making
off
home
in
twos
and
threes
saying
that
the
danes
will
depart
and
the
like
tomorrow
the
way
here
will
be
open
for
there
will
be
no
force
left
to
osric
by
the
morning
i
have
seen
such
things
before
then
must
the
lady
alswythe
fly
i
said
but
where
is
matelgar
struck
down
as
he
fled
said
wulfhere
grimly
i
saw
osric
and
twenty
of
his
men
close
round
him
and
beat
back
the
danes
for
a
moment
but
i
could
not
win
to
them
and
so
came
back
to
you
as
you
rallied
us
that
was
well
done
he
said
again
i
left
when
osric
came
up
matelgar
i
saw
not
i
said
osric
saw
you
though
answered
wulfhere
and
moreover
knew
you
and
i
heard
him
cry
out
when
he
saw
the
white
horse
riderless
for
the
arrows
were
still
flying
and
he
thought
you
slain
i
think
now
i
wondered
if
osric
would
be
wroth
with
me
thinking
i
had
fought
against
his
orders
but
i
had
little
time
to
think
of
myself
all
my
care
being
for
alswythe
who
had
lost
home
and
father
in
one
day
being
left
to
wulfhere
and
me
an
outlaw
then
wulfhere
and
i
took
counsel
about
flight
being
troubled
also
about
the
holy
women
in
this
place
for
the
heathen
would
not
respect
the
walls
of
a
nunnery
but
for
them
we
thought
osric
would
surely
care
now
there
came
to
us
as
we
stood
and
talked
a
housecarle
in
a
green
cloak
and
asked
us
if
we
had
seen
a
warrior
wounded
maybe
riding
a
great
white
horse
which
he
added
had
been
edred
the
thane
who
was
killed
aye
that
have
i
said
wulfhere
what
of
him
osric
the
sheriff
seeks
him
tell
me
quickly
where
i
may
find
him
is
osric
back
in
the
town
asked
wulfhere
in
surprise
aye
man
and
half
the
levy
with
him
the
danes
will
go
away
now
enough
are
left
to
mind
them
then
wulfhere
stamped
on
the
ground
in
rage
cursing
the
folly
of
every
man
of
the
levy
and
the
housecarle
stared
at
him
as
at
one
gone
suddenly
mad
but
i
knew
only
too
well
that
his
worst
fears
were
on
the
way
to
be
realized
and
that
soon
there
would
be
no
force
left
on
cannington
hill
suddenly
he
turned
on
the
messenger
and
asked
if
he
knew
the
name
of
the
man
he
sought
no
but
men
say
that
it
was
one
heregar
an
outlawed
thane
and
some
say
that
it
was
one
of
the
saints
will
osric
string
him
up
think
you
if
he
can
catch
him
and
it
be
heregar
only
and
no
saint
the
man
stared
again
surely
not
he
said
for
he
was
sore
cast
down
once
on
the
hill
thinking
him
slain
but
men
had
seen
him
remount
and
ride
on
and
osric
bid
me
and
all
of
us
who
seek
him
pray
heregar
if
heregar
it
be
to
come
to
him
in
all
honour
let
me
go
and
seek
him
then
wulfhere
turned
to
me
and
asked
if
i
would
go
and
at
that
the
man
made
reverence
to
me
giving
his
message
again
then
i
said
is
matelgar
the
thane
with
him
and
he
answered
that
matelgar
was
slain
before
the
stand
was
made
then
i
said
i
would
go
if
only
to
ask
osric
for
a
guard
to
keep
the
lady
alswythe
safe
in
her
flight
and
wulfhere
agreed
but
doubtfully
saying
that
nevertheless
he
would
make
ready
the
horses
and
provisions
for
a
journey
biding
till
i
came
back
or
sent
a
messenger
so
i
went
with
the
housecarle
who
led
me
again
through
the
marketplace
to
that
same
great
house
whence
i
had
been
sent
forth
overnight
all
the
square
was
full
of
men
drinking
deeply
some
boasting
of
their
deeds
and
some
of
deeds
to
be
done
yet
but
many
sat
silent
and
gloomy
and
more
cried
out
with
pain
as
their
wounds
were
dressed
by
the
leeches
or
the
womenfolk
all
was
confusion
and
indeed
one
might
not
know
if
this
turmoil
was
after
victory
or
defeat
none
noticed
me
or
my
guide
but
indeed
i
saw
few
men
i
knew
in
all
the
crowd
for
the
men
of
bridgwater
and
those
of
matelgar
following
had
fought
most
fiercely
on
their
own
land
and
even
now
stayed
to
guard
what
they
might
on
the
hill
osric
again
sat
in
the
great
chair
in
the
hall
as
i
could
see
through
the
open
door
and
round
him
were
the
thanes
but
far
fewer
than
last
night
and
presently
a
housecarle
spoke
to
him
and
he
rose
up
and
left
the
hall
then
they
led
me
to
a
smaller
chamber
and
there
he
was
alone
and
waiting
for
me
now
i
knew
not
what
his
wish
to
see
me
might
mean
but
from
him
i
looked
for
no
harm
remembering
how
he
had
seemed
to
favour
me
even
in
refusing
my
request
but
least
of
all
did
i
look
for
him
to
come
forward
to
meet
me
taking
both
my
hands
and
grasping
them
while
he
thanked
me
for
the
day
work
lightly
i
let
you
go
last
night
heregar
he
said
setting
little
store
on
the
matter
among
all
the
trouble
of
the
gathering
but
when
i
sent
you
away
and
forgot
you
surely
the
saints
guided
me
for
i
have
heard
how
you
dared
to
go
down
to
stert
and
warn
us
all
and
i
saw
you
stay
the
flight
even
now
much
praise
and
more
than
that
is
due
to
you
were
you
in
the
fight
then
i
could
answer
him
to
a
plain
question
for
all
this
praise
though
it
was
good
to
hear
abashed
me
nay
sheriff
i
answered
fain
would
i
have
been
there
but
a
wiser
head
than
mine
advised
me
and
bade
me
do
your
bidding
and
forbear
else
should
i
surely
have
fought
loyalty
has
brought
good
to
us
all
heregar
he
said
looking
squarely
at
me
yet
should
i
have
hardly
blamed
you
had
you
disobeyed
me
then
i
flushed
red
thinking
shame
not
to
have
done
so
and
went
to
excuse
myself
for
obedience
yet
had
i
the
safety
of
a
lady
who
must
die
if
the
battle
went
wrongly
for
us
laid
on
me
in
a
way
i
said
matelgar
fair
daughter
he
asked
aye
sheriff
and
i
told
him
of
the
flight
from
the
hall
and
where
she
was
now
wondering
how
he
guessed
this
but
i
had
come
from
stert
and
therefore
the
guess
was
no
wonder
he
looked
at
me
gravely
and
then
sat
down
motioning
me
to
be
seated
also
he
treated
me
not
as
an
outlaw
i
thought
matelgar
is
dead
he
said
i
saw
him
fall
and
tried
to
bring
him
off
he
was
not
yet
sped
when
we
beat
off
the
danes
and
he
had
time
to
speak
to
me
i
bowed
in
silence
not
knowing
what
to
say
strange
that
now
my
enemy
was
dead
i
had
no
joy
in
it
but
i
thought
of
alswythe
only
the
sheriff
went
on
looking
at
me
closely
he
bade
me
find
heregar
the
outlawed
thane
who
spoke
last
night
to
me
and
bid
him
forgive
then
he
died
and
i
must
needs
leave
him
for
the
danes
came
on
in
force
still
i
was
silent
for
many
thoughts
came
up
in
my
heart
and
choked
me
how
i
had
hated
him
and
yet
how
he
had
wronged
me
even
to
seeking
my
life
yet
was
i
beginning
to
think
of
him
but
as
a
bad
father
to
my
alswythe
but
a
man
to
be
held
in
some
regard
for
the
sake
of
her
love
to
him
and
it
seems
to
me
that
shaping
my
words
to
this
end
so
often
had
gradually
turned
my
utter
bitterness
away
for
one
has
to
make
thoughts
go
the
way
one
speaks
if
one
would
seem
to
speak
true
i
may
not
make
out
all
this
heregar
my
friend
said
the
sheriff
but
that
you
were
disloyal
ever
no
man
may
say
in
my
hearing
after
this
day
work
and
i
know
that
matelgar
was
the
foremost
in
accusing
you
wherefore
it
seems
to
me
that
there
was
work
there
to
be
forgiven
by
you
is
that
so
the
thing
was
so
plain
that
i
could
but
bow
my
head
in
assent
now
he
went
on
i
have
heard
private
talk
of
this
sort
before
now
but
never
mind
i
can
not
inlaw
you
again
heregar
for
that
must
needs
be
done
in
full
moot
as
was
the
outlawry
yet
shall
all
my
power
be
bent
to
help
you
back
to
your
own
if
only
for
the
sake
of
today
then
would
i
thank
him
but
he
stopped
me
to
the
man
who
lit
the
fire
of
stert
who
checked
the
panic
on
cannington
hill
thanks
are
due
not
gratitude
from
him
and
to
him
justice
and
reward
now
i
knew
not
what
to
say
but
at
that
moment
came
a
hurried
rapping
on
the
door
and
the
sound
of
voices
speaking
together
then
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
man
entered
heated
and
breathless
crying
the
danes
they
are
on
our
men
again
then
osric
flushed
red
and
his
eyes
sparkled
and
he
bid
the
thanes
who
crowded
after
the
messenger
get
to
horse
and
sound
the
assembly
at
once
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
those
who
were
yet
on
the
hill
and
yet
he
turned
to
me
when
this
was
said
and
took
my
hand
again
get
your
lady
in
safety
to
glastonbury
where
ealhstan
the
bishop
is
i
will
care
for
the
nuns
if
need
be
take
this
ring
of
mine
and
show
it
to
him
and
then
ride
with
it
to
eanulf
the
ealdorman
and
tell
him
of
our
straits
the
words
i
leave
to
you
who
have
done
better
than
all
of
us
today
then
he
took
helm
and
sword
from
one
who
brought
them
in
haste
and
armed
himself
while
i
putting
the
ring
he
had
given
me
on
my
finger
yet
stood
beside
him
when
he
was
armed
he
turned
sharply
to
me
you
want
to
fight
again
he
said
well
i
will
not
blame
you
but
believe
me
you
will
do
more
for
us
in
going
to
eanulf
than
in
spending
your
life
here
for
nought
then
he
saw
he
had
said
too
much
perhaps
and
motioning
his
man
out
of
the
room
so
that
we
were
alone
he
went
on
quickly
i
say
for
nought
because
all
i
can
do
is
to
hold
back
the
danes
for
a
little
you
have
seen
how
it
is
we
are
evenly
matched
in
numbers
or
thereabout
but
they
are
trained
and
hardened
warriors
and
our
poor
men
are
all
unused
to
war
moreover
heregar
these
danes
come
to
fight
and
our
men
do
but
fight
because
they
must
now
i
will
send
one
after
you
to
glastonbury
to
let
you
know
how
this
matter
goes
but
it
will
be
i
fear
no
pleasant
message
then
would
i
not
ask
him
for
men
as
i
had
been
minded
to
do
knowing
what
a
strait
he
was
in
and
that
his
words
were
only
too
true
those
two
differences
between
dane
and
saxon
in
those
days
of
the
first
fighting
left
the
victory
too
plainly
on
the
side
of
the
newcomers
and
they
sum
up
all
the
reasons
for
the
headway
they
made
against
us
till
alfred
our
wise
king
taught
us
to
meet
them
in
their
own
way
so
once
more
i
felt
the
grip
of
osric
hand
on
mine
and
i
left
him
with
a
heavy
heart
indeed
but
with
a
new
hope
for
myself
and
for
alswythe
in
the
end
i
stood
for
a
moment
before
i
turned
out
of
the
marketplace
eating
a
loaf
i
had
taken
from
the
table
as
i
passed
and
watching
the
men
gather
spiritless
for
this
new
fight
on
many
too
the
strong
ale
had
told
and
it
was
a
sorry
force
that
osric
could
take
with
him
but
i
might
not
stay
and
was
turning
to
go
when
i
saw
one
standing
like
myself
and
watching
close
by
it
was
my
host
of
sedgemoor
dudda
the
collier
and
never
was
face
more
welcome
than
his
grimy
countenance
for
now
i
knew
that
i
had
found
one
who
in
an
hour
would
take
alswythe
into
paths
where
none
might
follow
and
that
too
on
the
nearest
road
to
glastonbury
there
is
no
safer
place
for
those
who
would
fly
than
the
wastes
of
sedgemoor
to
those
who
know
or
have
guide
to
them
and
there
no
danes
would
ever
come
so
i
stepped
up
to
him
and
touched
him
and
he
grinned
at
seeing
a
known
face
muttering
to
himself
grendel
the
king
messenger
and
as
i
beckoned
he
willingly
followed
me
towards
my
destination
asking
me
of
the
fight
and
what
was
on
hand
now
so
suddenly
i
told
him
shortly
finding
that
he
had
been
drawn
from
his
own
neighbourhood
by
curiosity
which
must
be
satisfied
before
he
went
back
and
i
told
him
that
now
the
danes
were
close
on
bridgwater
and
that
i
must
bear
messages
to
eanulf
the
ealdorman
would
he
earn
a
good
reward
by
getting
me
and
some
others
across
sedgemoor
by
the
paths
along
which
he
had
led
me
and
at
that
he
grinned
delighted
saying
aye
that
will
i
master
seeming
to
forget
all
else
in
prospect
of
gain
so
i
bade
him
follow
me
closely
and
soon
we
were
back
at
the
nunnery
gates
they
were
open
and
inside
i
could
see
the
horses
standing
wulfhere
was
waiting
for
me
looking
anxious
but
his
brow
cleared
as
he
saw
me
and
he
asked
for
the
news
saying
that
he
feared
i
had
fallen
into
the
wrong
hands
then
i
told
him
i
had
as
i
thought
no
more
to
fear
showing
him
the
sheriff
ring
and
telling
him
of
my
errand
that
is
nigh
as
good
as
inlawed
again
he
said
gladly
anyway
you
ride
as
the
sheriff
man
now
then
his
face
clouded
a
little
and
he
added
but
glastonbury
is
a
far
cry
master
for
the
roads
are
none
so
direct
then
i
called
the
collier
and
wulfhere
questioned
him
and
soon
was
glad
as
i
that
i
had
met
with
him
saying
that
in
an
hour
we
should
be
in
safety
but
he
would
that
the
prioress
and
her
ladies
would
come
also
for
he
knew
that
osric
fears
would
be
only
too
true
then
must
we
go
and
tell
alswythe
of
the
journey
she
must
make
and
how
to
tell
of
her
father
death
i
knew
not
nor
did
wulfhere
and
there
we
two
men
were
helpless
looking
at
one
another
in
the
courtyard
and
burning
with
impatience
to
get
off
let
us
go
first
and
tell
her
on
the
way
said
he
but
i
reminded
him
that
we
were
here
even
now
and
not
on
the
far
side
of
the
quantocks
because
she
would
by
no
means
leave
her
father
now
while
we
debated
this
the
old
sister
who
was
portress
opened
the
wicket
and
asked
us
through
it
why
these
horses
stood
in
the
yard
and
what
we
armed
men
did
there
and
that
decided
me
i
would
ask
for
speech
with
the
prioress
and
tell
her
the
trouble
that
pleased
wulfhere
and
i
did
so
then
the
portress
asked
who
i
might
be
and
lest
my
name
should
but
prove
a
bar
to
speech
with
the
lady
i
showed
her
osric
ring
which
she
knew
as
one
he
was
wont
to
give
to
men
as
surety
that
they
came
from
him
on
his
errand
and
that
was
enough
for
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
back
taking
me
to
the
guest
chamber
there
i
unhelmed
and
waited
while
those
minutes
seemed
very
long
though
they
were
but
few
before
the
lady
came
in
she
started
a
little
when
she
saw
who
i
was
for
she
had
known
me
well
and
knew
now
in
what
case
i
had
been
but
alswythe
had
told
her
also
of
what
i
had
been
able
to
do
for
her
last
night
if
she
had
heard
no
more
for
news
gets
inside
even
closed
walls
in
one
way
or
another
from
the
lay
people
who
serve
the
place
i
bent
my
knee
to
her
and
she
looked
at
me
very
sadly
saying
i
knew
and
loved
your
mother
heregar
my
son
and
sorely
have
i
grieved
for
you
not
believing
all
the
things
brought
against
you
how
come
you
here
now
then
i
held
out
my
hand
and
showed
her
osric
ring
only
saying
that
as
the
good
sheriff
trusted
me
i
would
ask
her
to
do
so
and
at
that
she
looked
glad
and
said
that
she
would
hold
osric
trust
as
against
any
word
she
had
heard
of
me
in
dispraise
so
i
bowed
and
then
thinking
it
foolish
to
waste
time
begged
her
to
forgive
bluntness
and
told
her
of
the
death
of
matelgar
and
of
the
sore
danger
of
the
town
and
of
how
osric
had
hidden
me
take
alswythe
to
glastonbury
to
the
bishop
and
how
he
would
himself
care
for
her
own
safety
she
was
a
brave
lady
and
worthy
of
the
race
of
offa
from
which
she
sprung
and
she
heard
me
to
the
end
only
growing
very
pale
while
her
hand
that
rested
on
the
table
grew
yet
whiter
as
she
clenched
it
can
we
not
recover
the
body
of
the
thane
she
asked
speaking
very
low
i
could
but
shake
my
head
for
i
knew
that
where
he
lay
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
danes
true
if
osric
could
beat
them
off
again
he
might
gain
truce
for
such
recovery
on
both
sides
but
that
seemed
hopeless
to
me
then
i
was
bold
to
add
now
lady
this
matter
is
pressing
and
in
your
hands
i
must
leave
it
trust
the
lady
alswythe
to
me
and
her
faithful
servant
wulfhere
and
i
will
be
answerable
for
her
with
my
life
but
of
her
father
death
i
dare
not
tell
her
then
she
bowed
her
head
a
little
and
i
think
was
praying
for
when
she
looked
at
me
again
her
face
was
very
calm
though
so
pale
alswythe
has
told
me
of
you
heregar
my
son
she
said
and
to
you
will
i
trust
her
moreover
i
will
bid
her
go
at
once
and
i
will
tell
her
that
heavy
news
you
bring
you
will
not
have
long
to
wait
for
in
truth
we
are
ready
fearing
such
as
this
then
i
kissed
her
hand
and
she
blessed
me
and
went
from
the
room
and
taught
by
her
example
i
prayed
that
i
might
not
fail
in
this
trust
but
find
safety
for
her
i
loved
now
came
the
sister
who
had
charge
of
such
things
and
set
before
me
a
good
meal
with
wine
saying
no
word
but
signing
the
cross
over
all
in
token
that
i
might
eat
and
glad
enough
was
i
to
do
so
though
in
haste
yet
before
i
would
begin
i
asked
that
sister
to
let
wulfhere
know
that
all
was
going
right
and
to
bid
him
be
ready
she
said
no
word
as
must
have
been
their
rule
but
went
out
and
i
knew
afterwards
that
she
sent
one
to
tell
him
in
a
quarter
hour
or
so
and
when
i
refreshed
with
the
good
food
i
so
needed
was
waxing
restless
and
impatient
the
prioress
came
back
and
signed
me
to
follow
her
and
taking
my
helm
i
did
so
till
we
came
to
the
great
door
leading
to
the
courtyard
there
stood
alswythe
very
pale
and
trying
to
stop
her
weeping
very
bravely
and
she
gave
me
her
hand
for
a
moment
without
a
word
and
it
was
cold
as
ice
and
shook
a
little
yet
it
had
a
lingering
grasp
on
mine
as
though
it
would
fain
rest
with
me
for
a
little
help
there
were
but
two
of
her
maidens
with
her
and
the
prioress
saw
that
i
was
surprised
and
said
the
rest
bide
with
us
heregar
and
here
they
will
surely
be
safe
alswythe
will
take
no
more
than
these
lest
you
are
hindered
on
the
journey
and
i
was
glad
of
that
though
i
should
have
loved
to
see
her
better
attended
as
befitted
her
yet
need
was
pressing
and
this
was
best
then
the
prioress
kissed
alswythe
and
the
maidens
and
wulfhere
set
them
on
their
horses
for
though
i
would
fain
help
alswythe
myself
the
lady
had
more
to
say
to
me
and
kept
me
she
told
me
to
take
my
charge
to
the
abbess
of
her
own
order
at
glastonbury
where
they
would
be
tended
in
all
honour
as
here
with
herself
and
she
gave
me
a
letter
also
to
the
abbess
to
tell
her
what
was
needed
and
why
they
came
and
then
she
gave
me
a
bag
with
gold
in
it
knowing
that
i
might
have
to
buy
help
on
the
way
for
all
this
i
thanked
her
but
she
said
that
rather
it
was
i
who
should
be
thanked
and
from
henceforward
if
her
word
should
in
any
way
have
weight
it
should
go
with
that
of
osric
the
sheriff
for
my
welfare
and
this
seemed
to
me
to
be
much
said
before
my
task
was
done
but
afterwards
i
knew
that
she
had
talked
with
wulfhere
who
had
told
her
all
even
to
the
treachery
of
matelgar
that
would
i
have
prevented
had
i
known
but
so
it
was
to
be
and
i
had
no
knowledge
of
it
till
long
after
wulfhere
had
been
called
in
to
give
her
news
while
i
was
with
osric
yet
he
had
not
dared
to
tell
her
of
the
thane
death
all
being
ready
i
mounted
that
white
steed
that
had
been
the
dead
thane
knowing
that
in
war
and
haste
these
things
must
be
taken
as
they
come
and
that
he
was
better
in
saxon
hands
than
danish
then
i
gave
the
word
and
we
started
dudda
the
collier
going
by
my
side
and
staring
at
the
prioress
and
all
things
round
him
alswythe
turned
and
looked
hard
at
her
aunt
as
we
passed
the
gates
and
i
also
she
stood
very
still
on
the
steps
before
the
great
door
with
the
portress
beside
her
there
was
only
the
old
lay
brother
in
the
court
beside
and
so
we
left
her
and
what
my
fears
were
for
her
and
hers
i
could
not
tell
alswythe
for
as
we
left
the
gates
something
in
the
sky
over
towards
the
battleground
caught
my
eyes
and
i
turned
cold
with
dread
it
was
the
smoke
from
burning
houses
at
cannington
chapter
x
flight
through
sedgemoor
i
was
glad
we
had
not
to
go
through
the
town
for
the
sights
there
were
such
as
alswythe
could
not
bear
to
look
on
and
if
that
smoke
meant
aught
it
meant
that
our
men
were
beaten
back
and
would
even
now
be
flying
into
the
place
with
perhaps
the
danes
at
their
heels
i
rode
alongside
wulfhere
and
motioned
to
him
to
look
and
as
he
did
so
he
groaned
then
he
spoke
quite
cheerfully
to
his
lady
saying
that
we
had
better
push
on
and
make
a
good
start
and
so
we
broke
into
a
steady
trot
and
covered
the
ground
rapidly
enough
ever
away
from
danger
i
rode
next
alswythe
but
i
would
not
dare
speak
to
her
as
vet
she
had
her
veil
down
and
was
quite
silent
and
i
felt
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
wait
for
her
wish
beside
me
trotted
the
collier
wulfhere
was
leading
and
next
to
alswythe
and
me
came
the
two
maidens
after
them
came
the
three
men
and
two
boys
all
mounted
and
leading
with
them
the
other
three
horses
of
the
twelve
we
had
brought
from
stert
they
were
laden
with
things
for
the
journey
given
by
the
prioress
and
with
what
they
had
saved
from
matelgar
hall
though
that
was
little
enough
wulfhere
would
fain
have
made
the
collier
ride
one
of
these
spare
horses
but
the
strange
man
had
refused
saying
that
his
own
legs
he
could
trust
but
not
those
of
a
beast
it
was
seven
in
the
bright
may
morning
when
dane
and
saxon
met
on
combwich
hill
it
was
midday
when
i
met
wulfhere
at
the
nunnery
and
now
it
was
three
hours
and
more
past
but
i
thought
there
was
yet
light
enough
left
for
us
to
find
our
way
across
sedgemoor
and
lodge
that
night
in
safety
in
the
village
near
the
collier
hut
and
so
too
thought
wulfhere
when
i
thinking
that
perhaps
alswythe
grief
might
find
its
own
solace
in
tears
when
i
was
not
by
her
rode
on
beside
him
for
a
while
once
set
me
on
polden
hills
master
said
wulfhere
i
can
do
well
enough
knowing
that
country
from
my
youth
but
this
is
a
good
chance
that
has
sent
you
your
friend
the
collier
so
he
spoke
and
then
i
fell
to
wondering
if
it
was
all
chance
as
we
say
that
led
my
feet
in
that
night
of
wandering
to
dudda
hut
that
now
i
might
find
help
in
sorer
need
than
that
for
few
there
are
who
could
serve
as
guide
over
that
waste
of
fen
and
swamp
and
but
for
him
we
must
needs
have
kept
the
main
roads
far
longer
in
their
way
to
glastonbury
as
skirting
sedgemoor
and
now
to
be
choked
with
flying
people
presently
wulfhere
asked
me
if
in
that
village
we
might
find
one
good
house
where
to
lodge
the
lady
alswythe
and
i
told
him
that
there
i
had
not
been
but
at
least
knew
of
one
substantial
franklin
for
my
playfellow
turkil
had
been
the
son
of
such
an
one
as
i
was
told
the
collier
who
ran
holding
my
stirrup
leather
tireless
on
his
lean
limbs
as
a
deerhound
heard
this
and
told
me
that
the
man
house
was
good
and
strong
not
like
those
in
bridgwater
but
a
great
house
for
these
parts
so
i
was
satisfied
enough
then
this
man
dudda
finding
i
listened
to
him
in
that
matter
began
to
talk
asking
me
questions
of
the
fighting
and
presently
if
i
had
seen
the
saint
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
and
as
i
did
so
i
heard
wulfhere
chuckle
to
himself
then
he
told
me
a
wild
story
that
was
going
round
the
town
how
that
when
all
seemed
lost
there
came
suddenly
a
wondrous
vision
rising
up
before
the
men
of
a
saint
clad
in
armour
and
riding
a
white
horse
having
his
face
covered
lest
men
should
be
blinded
by
the
light
thereof
who
standing
with
drawn
sword
on
cannington
hill
so
bade
the
men
take
courage
that
they
turned
and
beat
the
danes
back
whereupon
he
vanished
though
the
white
horse
yet
remained
for
a
little
before
it
too
was
gone
well
thought
i
grendel
the
fiend
was
i
but
the
other
day
and
now
i
am
to
be
a
saint
and
with
that
i
could
not
restrain
myself
but
laughed
as
once
before
i
had
laughed
at
this
same
man
for
the
very
foolishness
of
the
thing
yet
i
might
not
let
alswythe
know
that
i
laughed
and
so
could
not
let
it
go
as
i
would
and
i
saw
that
wulfhere
was
laughing
likewise
silently
now
this
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
though
it
was
but
a
little
thing
maybe
for
we
had
been
like
a
bow
overstrained
with
doubt
and
anxiety
and
now
that
we
were
in
safety
with
the
lady
it
needed
but
like
this
to
slacken
the
tension
and
bid
our
minds
relieve
themselves
so
that
laugh
did
us
both
good
and
moreover
took
away
some
of
the
downcast
look
from
our
faces
when
next
we
spoke
to
our
charge
when
he
could
speak
again
wulfhere
answered
the
man
still
smiling
aye
man
i
saw
him
and
he
was
wondrous
like
heregar
our
master
here
and
at
that
the
collier
stared
at
me
and
then
said
there
be
painted
saints
in
our
church
but
they
be
not
like
mortal
men
being
no
wise
so
as
the
master
and
that
set
wulfhere
laughing
again
for
the
good
monks
who
paint
these
things
are
seldom
good
limners
but
make
up
for
bad
drawing
by
bright
colour
so
that
one
may
only
know
saint
from
fiend
by
the
gold
or
the
want
of
it
round
his
head
then
fell
i
to
thinking
again
about
myself
and
what
it
takes
to
make
man
a
saint
or
a
fiend
and
that
thought
was
a
long
thought
now
were
we
come
across
parret
and
began
our
journey
into
the
fens
and
presently
we
must
ride
in
single
file
along
a
narrow
pathway
which
i
could
barely
trace
and
indeed
in
places
could
not
make
out
at
all
and
here
the
collier
led
going
warily
then
came
wulfhere
and
then
alswythe
with
myself
next
behind
her
to
help
if
need
were
after
us
the
maidens
and
then
the
rest
so
we
were
in
safety
for
half
a
mile
of
this
ground
was
safer
than
a
wall
behind
us
we
went
silently
for
a
little
while
save
for
a
few
words
of
caution
here
and
there
but
at
last
alswythe
turned
to
me
and
lifted
her
veil
smiling
a
little
to
me
at
last
and
asking
why
we
left
the
good
roads
for
this
wild
place
for
though
we
men
were
used
to
the
like
in
hunting
she
knew
not
that
such
places
and
paths
could
be
brought
up
as
she
was
in
the
wooded
uplands
of
our
own
corner
of
the
country
i
told
her
how
i
was
to
make
all
speed
to
glastonbury
and
that
this
was
the
nearest
road
and
she
was
content
being
very
trustful
in
both
her
protectors
but
then
she
asked
if
that
place
should
be
reached
before
dark
having
little
knowledge
of
places
or
distances
then
i
must
needs
tell
how
we
were
bound
for
that
village
where
the
hermit
was
and
turkil
of
whom
i
had
told
her
seeing
that
it
was
over
late
to
reach
the
town
but
that
there
we
hoped
to
come
next
day
and
she
said
she
would
fain
see
those
two
and
maybe
grendel
also
smiling
again
a
little
to
please
me
and
i
knew
how
much
that
little
jest
cost
her
to
make
and
loved
her
the
more
for
her
thought
for
me
then
she
was
silent
for
a
while
presently
one
of
the
men
in
the
rear
shouted
and
there
was
a
great
splashing
and
snorting
of
horses
and
we
looked
round
one
of
the
led
horses
had
gone
off
the
path
and
was
in
a
bog
and
that
had
set
the
rest
rearing
with
fright
so
we
had
to
halt
and
wulfhere
gave
his
horse
to
dudda
to
hold
while
he
went
back
and
that
kept
us
for
a
while
waiting
and
then
i
could
stand
beside
alswythe
for
a
little
i
have
seen
the
last
of
my
outlaw
they
tell
me
she
said
wanting
to
learn
how
things
were
with
me
yet
i
was
still
that
if
only
for
loss
of
lands
and
place
though
as
osric
chosen
messenger
i
had
that
last
again
for
a
little
because
of
his
need
so
i
told
her
that
that
matter
must
be
settled
by
the
moot
but
that
osric
was
my
friend
and
that
while
i
bore
his
ring
at
least
none
might
call
me
outlaw
and
at
that
she
was
glad
and
told
me
that
if
she
saw
leofwine
the
hermit
she
would
tell
him
that
his
words
were
coming
true
then
she
looked
hard
at
me
and
said
that
she
had
heard
from
her
aunt
why
osric
so
trusted
me
and
that
she
was
proud
of
heregar
and
i
said
that
i
had
but
done
the
things
that
someone
had
to
do
and
which
came
in
my
way
as
it
seemed
to
me
wherein
i
was
fortunate
at
that
she
smiled
at
me
seeming
to
think
more
of
the
matter
than
that
and
so
talked
of
other
things
yet
she
must
needs
at
last
come
to
that
which
lay
nearest
her
heart
and
so
asked
me
if
i
had
seen
her
father
fall
and
i
was
glad
to
say
that
i
had
not
adding
that
it
was
near
combwich
hill
as
i
had
heard
and
close
to
where
osric
the
sheriff
fought
so
i
think
that
all
her
life
long
she
believed
him
to
have
fallen
fighting
in
the
first
line
where
osric
was
with
his
face
to
the
enemy
for
all
men
spoke
well
of
the
sheriff
valour
that
day
and
none
would
say
more
than
i
told
her
yet
it
may
have
been
that
the
thane
fought
well
unobserved
in
that
press
and
there
is
perhaps
little
blame
to
many
who
fly
in
a
panic
now
that
spoken
of
and
passed
over
she
became
more
like
her
brave
self
and
from
that
time
on
would
speak
cheerfully
both
to
wulfhere
and
myself
as
the
horses
set
in
order
again
we
once
more
went
on
our
winding
way
following
our
guide
glad
was
i
when
just
before
sunset
we
saw
the
woodland
under
which
his
hut
was
set
and
heard
the
vesper
bell
ringing
far
off
from
the
village
church
soon
we
were
on
hard
ground
again
and
then
i
could
show
alswythe
where
i
had
played
grendel
unwittingly
and
point
the
way
i
had
wandered
from
brent
there
we
rested
the
horses
for
we
had
yet
two
miles
to
go
and
they
were
weary
with
the
long
and
heavy
travelling
of
the
fens
and
alswythe
would
go
into
the
hut
and
there
her
maidens
brought
her
food
and
wine
and
we
stayed
for
half
an
hour
wulfhere
and
i
looked
out
towards
bridgwater
town
now
seeming
under
the
very
hills
in
the
last
sunlight
smoke
rose
from
behind
it
but
that
was
doubtless
from
cannington
yet
there
were
other
clouds
of
smoke
rising
against
the
sun
and
as
he
looked
at
these
the
old
warrior
said
that
he
feared
the
worst
for
surely
the
danes
were
spreading
over
the
country
and
that
need
for
them
to
keep
together
was
gone
if
we
see
not
bridgwater
on
fire
by
tomorrow
he
said
it
will
be
a
wonder
but
we
knew
that
we
could
bide
here
for
this
night
safe
as
if
no
danes
were
nearer
than
the
scaw
after
that
rest
we
rode
on
through
the
woodland
path
down
which
they
had
come
to
exorcise
me
till
we
saw
before
us
in
the
gray
twilight
the
church
and
houses
of
the
village
pleasant
with
light
from
door
and
window
and
noise
of
barking
dogs
as
we
crossed
the
open
mark
viii
dudda
the
collier
led
us
to
the
largest
house
which
stood
on
the
little
central
green
round
which
the
buildings
clustered
and
there
the
door
stood
open
and
a
tall
man
with
a
small
boy
beside
him
looked
out
to
see
what
was
disturbing
the
dogs
behind
them
the
firelight
shone
red
on
a
pleasant
and
large
room
where
we
could
see
men
at
supper
and
the
light
shone
out
on
me
for
the
boy
sprang
out
from
his
side
shouting
that
it
was
grendel
come
back
again
and
running
to
me
to
greet
me
so
we
found
a
welcome
in
that
quiet
place
and
soon
the
good
wife
came
out
bustling
and
pitiful
in
her
care
for
alswythe
and
sorrow
for
her
need
to
fly
from
her
lost
home
for
it
took
but
few
words
to
explain
what
had
befallen
they
brought
us
in
and
the
thralls
left
supper
to
tend
our
horses
though
wulfhere
would
go
with
them
to
see
that
done
before
he
joined
us
in
the
wide
room
that
made
all
the
lower
floor
of
the
house
overhead
was
the
place
where
alswythe
and
her
maidens
should
be
and
built
against
the
walls
outside
were
the
thralls
quarters
save
for
a
few
who
slept
in
the
lower
room
round
the
great
fire
now
how
they
treated
us
it
needs
not
to
be
told
for
it
was
in
the
way
of
a
good
somerset
franklin
and
that
is
saying
much
but
that
night
he
would
talk
little
seeing
that
i
and
wulfhere
were
overdone
with
want
of
sleep
indeed
it
was
but
the
need
of
caution
that
had
kept
me
from
falling
asleep
on
my
horse
more
than
once
on
the
road
so
very
soon
they
brought
us
skins
and
cloaks
and
we
stretched
ourselves
before
the
fire
and
warmed
and
cleansed
and
well
refreshed
with
food
and
drink
fell
to
sleep
on
the
instant
yet
not
so
soundly
could
i
sleep
at
first
but
that
i
woke
once
thinking
i
heard
the
yells
of
the
danes
close
on
us
but
it
was
some
farmyard
sound
from
without
and
peaceful
then
i
slept
again
until
towards
dawning
i
think
i
awoke
shivering
and
with
a
great
untellable
fear
on
me
and
saw
a
tall
gray
figure
standing
by
my
couch
and
i
looked
and
lo
it
was
matelgar
the
thane
then
i
went
to
rouse
wulfhere
but
my
hand
would
not
be
stretched
out
and
the
other
men
slept
heavily
so
that
i
lay
still
and
looked
in
the
dead
thane
face
and
grew
calmer
for
his
face
was
set
with
a
look
of
sorrow
such
as
i
had
never
seen
there
and
he
gazed
steadfastly
at
me
and
i
at
him
and
the
grief
in
his
face
did
but
deepen
and
at
last
he
spoke
and
the
voice
was
his
own
and
yet
not
his
own
heregar
sorely
have
i
wronged
you
he
said
and
my
rest
is
troubled
therefor
yet
when
i
heard
what
you
had
done
for
mine
last
night
my
heart
was
sore
within
me
and
i
repented
of
all
and
would
surely
have
made
amends
and
now
it
is
too
late
and
my
body
lies
dishonoured
on
parret
side
while
i
am
here
yet
do
you
forgive
and
mayhap
i
shall
rest
then
i
strove
to
speak
bidding
him
know
that
i
forgave
but
i
could
not
and
he
seemed
to
grow
more
sad
watching
me
yet
and
when
i
saw
that
i
made
a
great
effort
and
stretching
my
hand
towards
him
signed
the
blessed
sign
in
token
that
that
should
bid
me
forgive
him
so
leaving
my
hand
outstretched
towards
him
and
then
his
face
changed
and
grew
brighter
and
he
took
my
hand
in
his
as
i
might
see
though
i
could
feel
nought
but
a
chill
pass
on
it
as
it
were
and
spoke
again
saying
it
is
well
and
shall
be
both
with
you
and
me
and
when
you
need
me
i
shall
stand
by
you
once
again
and
make
amends
then
he
was
gone
and
my
hand
fell
from
where
his
had
been
and
straightway
i
slept
again
in
a
dreamless
sleep
till
wulfhere
roused
me
in
the
full
morning
light
and
in
that
light
this
matter
seemed
to
me
but
a
dream
that
had
come
to
me
yet
even
as
i
should
have
wished
to
speak
to
alswythe
father
had
i
done
and
i
would
not
have
had
it
otherwise
then
the
dream
in
a
way
comforted
me
being
good
to
think
on
for
i
would
not
willingly
be
at
enmity
with
any
man
or
living
or
dead
but
that
it
was
only
a
dream
seemed
more
sure
because
in
it
matelgar
had
said
he
knew
of
my
saving
alswythe
and
wulfhere
and
i
had
agreed
not
to
tell
him
that
also
i
had
little
need
of
matelgar
living
in
good
truth
and
surely
less
need
of
him
now
that
he
was
gone
past
making
amends
down
into
the
great
chamber
to
break
her
fast
with
us
came
alswythe
bright
and
fresh
and
with
her
grief
put
on
one
side
for
our
sakes
who
served
her
and
turkil
talked
gaily
with
both
alswythe
and
me
and
wulfhere
and
would
fain
tell
all
the
story
of
how
he
sought
the
fiend
and
was
disappointed
then
i
missed
the
collier
and
asked
where
he
was
he
had
gone
to
bring
the
good
hermit
the
franklin
told
me
and
would
be
back
shortly
now
when
we
had
broken
our
fast
it
was
yet
very
early
and
the
villagers
must
needs
hear
all
the
news
of
the
great
fight
and
terror
beyond
the
fens
and
as
they
heard
a
growl
of
wrath
went
round
and
the
men
grasped
spade
and
staff
and
fork
fiercely
bidding
the
franklin
lead
them
at
once
to
join
the
levy
but
wulfhere
told
them
that
they
needs
must
now
wait
a
second
raising
and
that
i
was
even
now
on
my
way
to
eanulf
the
ealdorman
to
tell
him
of
the
need
then
the
franklin
asked
that
he
and
his
might
go
with
me
but
i
seeing
that
for
an
outlaw
to
take
a
following
with
him
was
not
to
be
thought
of
bade
them
wait
for
word
and
sure
tidings
of
the
gathering
place
while
we
talked
thus
the
little
bell
in
the
church
turret
began
to
ring
and
we
knew
that
the
hermit
leofwine
the
priest
had
come
and
would
say
mass
for
us
then
perhaps
was
such
a
gathering
to
pray
for
relief
for
their
land
as
had
not
been
since
those
days
far
off
now
when
the
british
prayed
in
that
same
place
the
like
prayers
for
deliverance
from
my
own
forbears
and
as
i
prayed
looking
on
the
calm
face
of
the
old
man
who
had
bidden
me
take
heart
and
forgive
i
knew
that
last
night
dream
was
true
in
this
that
i
had
forgiven
so
when
the
mass
was
over
and
wulfhere
had
begged
alswythe
to
take
order
at
once
for
our
going
on
our
journey
i
found
the
old
man
and
could
greet
him
with
a
light
heart
and
he
looking
on
me
could
read
as
he
had
read
the
trouble
how
that
that
had
passed
and
asked
me
if
all
was
well
as
my
face
seemed
to
say
i
told
him
how
i
had
fared
and
how
my
outlawry
though
still
in
force
was
now
light
on
me
as
the
sheriff
messenger
though
this
i
thought
was
but
because
flying
with
alswythe
i
might
as
well
take
the
message
as
one
who
could
be
less
easily
spared
then
he
said
that
already
he
deemed
the
prophecy
that
had
been
given
him
was
coming
true
and
spoke
many
good
and
loving
words
to
me
to
strengthen
my
thoughts
of
peace
withal
presently
he
looked
at
our
horses
now
standing
ready
at
the
door
and
would
have
me
go
back
with
him
into
his
own
chamber
in
the
little
church
and
there
he
found
writing
things
in
a
chest
and
wrote
on
a
slip
of
parchment
a
letter
which
he
bade
me
give
to
the
bishop
when
i
came
to
him
signing
it
with
his
name
at
the
end
as
he
told
me
though
i
could
not
read
it
for
one
who
has
been
bred
a
hunter
and
warrior
has
no
need
for
the
arts
of
the
clerk
indeed
i
had
seen
but
two
men
write
before
and
one
was
our
old
priest
at
cannington
and
the
other
was
matelgar
and
i
ever
wondered
that
this
latter
should
be
able
to
do
so
and
why
of
late
he
was
often
sending
men
with
letters
yet
it
seems
to
me
now
that
surely
they
had
to
do
with
his
schemes
that
had
so
come
to
nought
then
the
old
man
blessed
me
telling
me
again
that
i
should
surely
prosper
unless
that
i
failed
by
my
own
fault
and
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
yet
work
for
me
to
do
that
should
set
me
again
in
my
place
and
maybe
higher
so
talking
with
him
wulfhere
called
me
and
i
must
needs
say
farewell
to
turkil
and
his
father
and
they
bade
us
return
when
the
time
came
by
this
way
back
to
our
own
place
and
turkil
wept
and
would
fain
have
gone
with
us
but
i
promised
to
see
him
again
and
waved
hand
to
him
before
the
broad
meadows
of
the
mark
were
passed
and
the
woods
hid
the
village
from
us
then
did
alswythe
in
her
kindness
fall
into
a
like
mistake
as
that
i
had
made
with
the
boy
for
she
turned
to
me
smiling
and
said
that
she
would
surely
take
him
into
her
service
at
stert
and
see
to
his
training
hereafter
but
then
remembered
that
she
had
no
longer
home
and
her
smile
faded
into
tears
my
heart
ached
for
her
knowing
i
could
give
her
no
comfort
after
that
we
rode
in
silence
and
quickly
for
the
track
was
good
now
there
is
little
to
tell
of
that
ride
till
we
reached
the
hilltop
that
wulfhere
knew
and
where
we
could
look
down
on
the
land
we
were
to
cross
and
fancy
we
could
see
glastonbury
far
away
here
dudda
the
collier
task
was
ended
and
i
called
him
to
me
pulling
out
the
purse
the
good
prioress
had
given
me
that
i
might
give
him
a
gold
piece
for
his
faithful
service
he
stood
before
me
cap
in
hand
and
i
gave
him
a
bright
new
coin
and
he
took
it
turning
it
over
curiously
take
it
dudda
i
said
you
have
earned
it
well
then
he
grinned
in
his
way
and
answered
it
is
no
good
to
me
master
i
pray
you
give
me
silver
instead
like
were
i
to
starve
if
life
lay
in
the
changing
of
this
among
our
poor
folk
so
i
turned
over
the
money
to
find
silver
but
there
was
not
enough
and
so
i
took
out
that
bag
which
i
had
found
in
the
roadway
and
had
not
opened
since
having
almost
forgotten
it
there
was
silver
and
copper
only
in
that
and
i
began
to
give
him
his
reward
but
still
the
man
hesitated
and
seemed
anxious
to
ask
me
something
and
while
i
counted
out
the
money
he
spoke
master
the
men
call
you
heregar
and
that
is
an
outlaw
name
well
said
i
fearing
no
reproach
from
that
just
now
and
being
sure
that
by
this
time
the
man
knew
all
about
me
from
our
thralls
with
us
heregar
the
outlawed
thane
i
was
and
am
except
that
the
sheriff
has
bid
me
ride
on
his
business
then
master
said
he
give
me
no
reward
but
to
serve
you
no
man
am
i
either
free
or
unfree
but
son
of
escaped
thralls
who
are
dead
long
ago
therefore
am
i
outlaw
also
by
all
rights
and
would
fain
follow
you
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
will
need
one
to
mind
your
steed
now
this
was
a
long
speech
for
the
collier
who
as
i
had
learnt
could
hold
his
tongue
and
we
were
also
with
all
these
horses
therefore
i
told
him
that
it
should
be
as
he
would
for
service
offered
freely
in
this
way
was
like
to
be
faithful
seeing
that
there
had
been
trial
on
both
sides
but
i
gave
him
four
silver
pennies
which
he
would
have
refused
but
that
i
bade
him
think
of
them
as
fasten
pennies
which
contented
him
well
this
too
pleased
both
alswythe
and
wulfhere
who
were
glad
of
the
addition
to
our
party
so
we
rode
on
but
many
were
the
columns
of
smoke
we
looked
back
on
beyond
parret
before
the
hills
rose
behind
us
and
hid
them
chapter
xi
ealhstan
the
bishop
it
was
in
the
late
afternoon
when
we
rode
into
glastonbury
town
past
the
palisadings
of
the
outer
works
and
then
among
cottages
and
here
and
there
a
timber
house
of
the
better
sort
till
we
came
to
the
great
abbey
it
was
not
so
great
then
as
now
nor
is
it
now
as
it
will
be
for
ever
have
pious
hands
built
so
that
those
who
come
after
may
have
room
to
add
if
they
will
but
it
was
the
greatest
building
that
i
had
ever
seen
and
moreover
of
stone
throughout
which
seemed
wonderful
to
me
and
there
too
wulfhere
showed
me
the
thorn
tree
which
sprang
from
the
staff
of
the
blessed
joseph
of
arimathea
which
flowers
on
christmas
day
ever
then
we
came
to
the
nunnery
where
we
should
leave
alswythe
and
i
for
my
part
was
sorry
that
the
journey
was
over
sad
though
it
had
been
in
many
ways
for
when
i
must
leave
her
i
knew
not
how
long
it
should
be
if
ever
before
i
saw
her
again
and
i
think
the
same
thought
was
in
her
heart
for
when
wulfhere
showed
her
the
great
house
she
sighed
looking
at
me
a
little
and
i
could
say
nothing
but
she
began
to
thank
us
two
for
our
care
of
her
as
though
we
could
have
borne
to
take
less
than
we
had
and
her
words
were
so
sweet
and
gracious
that
even
the
old
warrior
could
not
find
wherewith
to
answer
her
and
we
both
bowed
our
heads
in
thanks
and
rode
one
on
each
side
of
her
in
silence
then
she
must
ask
wulfhere
what
he
would
do
when
she
was
safely
bestowed
and
that
was
a
plain
question
he
could
answer
well
truly
lady
if
you
will
give
me
leave
i
would
see
heregar
our
master
through
whatever
comes
of
his
messages
then
was
i
very
glad
and
the
more
that
though
i
might
not
think
myself
such
the
old
warrior
would
call
me
his
master
for
that
told
me
that
he
had
full
belief
in
me
yet
i
could
but
say
friend
should
you
call
me
wulfhere
my
good
counsellor
not
master
and
i
reached
out
my
hand
to
him
bowing
to
alswythe
whose
horse
neck
i
must
cross
and
wulfhere
took
it
and
on
our
two
rough
hands
alswythe
laid
her
white
fingers
pressing
them
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
said
two
such
friends
i
think
no
woman
ever
had
or
wiser
or
braver
go
on
together
as
you
will
and
yet
forget
not
me
here
in
glastonbury
then
we
loosed
our
hands
looking
maybe
a
little
askance
for
our
saxon
nature
will
oft
be
ashamed
if
one
may
call
it
so
of
a
good
impulse
acted
on
and
wulfhere
said
that
we
must
think
of
those
things
hereafter
when
we
came
to
the
gate
there
was
a
little
crowd
following
us
for
word
had
gone
round
in
some
way
that
we
were
fugitives
from
parret
side
but
wulfhere
had
bade
the
men
answer
no
questions
till
we
had
seen
the
bishop
lest
false
reports
should
go
about
the
place
so
the
crowd
melted
away
soon
and
we
knocked
asking
admission
and
showing
the
letter
from
the
prioress
of
bridgwater
now
here
there
was
much
state
as
it
seemed
and
we
must
wait
for
a
little
but
then
the
gates
were
thrown
open
and
we
rode
through
them
into
the
courtyard
which
was
large
and
open
then
opened
a
great
door
on
the
left
and
there
was
the
abbess
with
many
sisters
and
one
asked
me
for
the
letter
we
bore
so
i
gave
it
and
standing
there
the
abbess
read
it
while
we
waited
as
she
read
she
grew
pale
and
then
flushed
again
and
at
last
after
twice
reading
came
down
the
steps
all
her
state
forgotten
and
with
tears
embraced
alswythe
giving
thanks
for
her
safety
and
then
leaving
her
she
came
to
me
where
i
sat
unhelmed
and
gave
me
her
hand
thanking
me
for
all
i
had
done
and
as
she
said
perhaps
for
the
safety
of
the
bridgwater
sisters
also
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
went
back
up
the
steps
where
the
sisters
were
whispering
together
and
became
cold
and
stately
again
so
that
i
wondered
if
i
had
offended
her
in
not
speaking
which
i
dared
not
when
she
was
back
again
in
her
place
she
bade
alswythe
and
her
maidens
welcome
and
added
that
all
her
sister
prioress
asked
her
she
would
do
also
that
one
would
come
and
show
us
lodging
for
men
and
horses
which
should
be
at
the
expense
of
the
nunnery
so
alswythe
must
needs
part
from
us
coldly
even
as
she
had
joined
us
at
bridgwater
as
a
noble
lady
from
her
attendants
giving
us
her
hand
to
kiss
only
but
i
went
back
to
my
horse
well
content
knowing
that
her
love
and
thoughts
went
out
to
me
she
went
through
the
great
door
but
it
closed
not
so
fast
but
that
i
might
see
the
abbess
put
her
arm
around
her
very
tenderly
her
state
forgotten
again
and
i
knew
that
she
was
in
good
hands
now
when
the
horses
were
stabled
and
our
men
knew
where
they
should
bide
in
the
strangers
lodgings
set
apart
for
the
trains
of
guests
to
the
nunnery
which
were
very
spacious
wulfhere
and
i
must
needs
find
the
way
to
get
audience
of
the
bishop
as
far
as
the
doors
of
the
abbey
where
he
abode
was
easy
enough
but
there
waiting
for
alms
and
broken
meats
were
crowds
of
beggars
sitting
and
lying
about
in
the
sun
with
their
eyes
ever
on
the
latch
to
be
first
when
it
was
lifted
for
the
daily
dole
and
again
round
the
gate
were
many
men
of
all
sorts
suitors
as
we
deemed
for
some
favour
at
the
hands
of
bishop
or
abbot
for
the
abbot
of
glastonbury
was
nigh
as
powerful
as
ealhstan
himself
in
his
own
town
at
least
when
we
came
among
these
we
were
told
that
we
must
bide
our
time
for
audience
was
not
given
but
at
stated
hours
and
one
man
grumbling
said
that
that
was
not
ealhstan
way
in
his
own
place
at
sherborne
for
there
the
doors
were
open
ever
but
i
knew
that
my
business
might
not
wait
and
so
after
a
little
of
this
talk
went
up
to
the
gate
and
thundered
thereon
in
such
sort
that
the
wicket
opened
and
the
porter
face
looked
through
it
angrily
enough
and
he
would
have
bidden
us
begone
for
war
and
travel
had
stained
us
both
so
that
doubtless
we
were
in
no
better
case
as
to
looks
than
the
crowd
that
pressed
after
us
very
quietly
indeed
to
hear
the
parley
one
difference
in
our
looks
there
was
however
which
made
the
porter
silent
we
wore
mail
and
swords
and
at
that
he
seemed
to
stare
in
wonder
then
i
held
up
the
ring
and
said
messages
from
osric
the
sheriff
whereupon
the
wicket
closed
suddenly
and
there
was
a
sound
of
unbarring
and
the
door
opened
and
we
were
let
in
the
rest
who
must
wait
grumbling
loudly
at
the
preference
shown
to
us
while
the
beggars
who
had
roused
at
the
sound
of
the
hinges
creaking
went
back
whining
in
their
disappointment
then
one
came
and
bade
us
follow
him
and
we
were
led
into
the
abbey
hall
and
there
waited
for
a
little
there
were
a
few
monks
about
passing
and
repassing
but
they
paid
no
attention
to
us
and
we
too
were
silent
in
that
quiet
place
only
a
great
fire
crackled
at
one
end
of
the
hall
else
there
would
have
been
no
noise
at
all
it
was
i
thought
a
strangely
peaceful
place
into
which
to
bring
news
of
war
and
tumult
then
i
thought
of
ealhstan
the
bishop
as
he
had
seemed
to
me
when
he
judged
me
and
that
seemed
years
ago
nor
could
i
think
of
myself
as
the
same
who
had
stood
a
prisoner
before
him
so
i
wondered
if
i
should
seem
the
same
to
him
now
it
is
strange
that
of
eanulf
the
mighty
ealdorman
who
had
pronounced
my
doom
i
thought
little
at
all
but
as
of
one
who
was
by
the
bishop
all
that
day
doings
seemed
to
have
been
as
a
dream
wherein
i
and
wulfhere
had
living
part
with
this
bishop
while
the
rest
eanulf
and
matelgar
and
the
others
were
but
phantoms
standing
by
maybe
this
is
not
so
wonderful
for
the
doom
was
the
doom
of
the
moot
and
spoken
by
eanulf
as
its
mouthpiece
and
that
passed
on
my
body
only
and
matelgar
had
found
a
new
place
in
my
thoughts
but
wulfhere
was
my
friend
and
the
bishop
had
spoken
to
my
heart
so
that
his
words
and
looks
abode
there
then
the
servant
cut
short
my
thoughts
and
led
us
to
the
bishop
bidding
me
unhelm
first
he
sat
in
a
wide
chamber
with
another
most
man
at
the
same
table
and
all
the
walls
were
covered
with
books
and
on
the
table
too
lay
one
or
two
great
ones
open
and
bright
with
gold
and
crimson
borderings
and
great
litters
on
the
pages
but
those
things
i
saw
presently
only
the
bishop
first
of
all
sitting
quietly
and
very
upright
in
his
great
chair
dressed
in
a
long
purple
robe
and
with
a
golden
cross
hanging
on
his
breast
and
for
a
moment
as
i
looked
at
him
i
remembered
the
day
of
the
moot
and
my
heart
rose
up
and
i
was
ready
to
hide
my
face
for
minding
the
shame
thereof
but
he
looked
at
me
curiously
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
smiled
very
kindly
and
said
heregar
my
son
are
you
the
messenger
and
i
knelt
before
him
on
one
knee
and
held
out
the
ring
for
him
to
take
and
he
did
so
laying
it
on
the
table
before
him
for
my
errand
was
in
hand
yet
then
he
said
things
are
none
so
ill
with
you
my
son
and
he
smiled
gravely
but
do
your
errand
first
and
afterwards
we
will
speak
of
that
so
i
rose
up
and
standing
before
him
told
him
plainly
all
that
had
befallen
though
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
say
aught
of
myself
in
the
matter
except
that
flying
with
the
lady
osric
had
chosen
me
to
bear
the
message
of
defeat
and
danger
and
the
while
i
spoke
the
bishop
face
grew
very
grave
but
he
said
nothing
till
i
ended
by
saying
that
wulfhere
could
tell
him
of
the
fight
then
he
bade
wulfhere
speak
being
anxious
to
know
the
worst
as
it
seemed
to
me
but
the
old
man
with
him
was
weeping
and
his
hands
shook
sorely
now
into
what
wulfhere
told
my
name
seemed
to
come
often
for
he
began
with
the
first
landing
at
watchet
and
my
bearing
the
war
arrow
and
so
forward
to
the
firing
of
the
huts
at
stert
to
the
rallying
on
cannington
hill
and
our
flight
and
how
osric
sent
for
me
then
said
the
bishop
is
that
the
worst
and
wulfhere
was
fain
to
answer
that
he
feared
not
telling
of
the
smoke
clouds
we
had
seen
and
what
he
judged
therefrom
aye
said
the
bishop
as
it
were
to
himself
and
looking
before
him
as
one
who
sees
that
which
he
is
told
of
we
saw
the
like
after
charnmouth
and
let
them
have
their
way
now
must
we
wait
trembling
for
osric
next
messenger
but
as
for
me
though
the
old
man
was
sorely
terrified
as
one
might
see
i
thought
there
was
little
trembling
on
the
bishop
part
though
he
spoke
of
it
rather
did
he
seem
to
speak
in
scorn
of
such
as
would
so
wait
tell
me
now
he
went
on
presently
how
the
men
rallied
and
with
what
spirit
on
the
hill
where
heregar
stayed
them
well
and
bravely
answered
wulfhere
so
that
the
danes
drew
back
forming
up
hastily
lest
there
should
be
an
attack
on
them
but
none
was
made
then
the
bishop
eyes
flashed
and
i
thought
to
myself
that
i
would
he
had
been
there
surely
he
would
have
swept
the
danes
back
to
their
ships
and
i
think
that
was
in
wulfhere
mind
also
for
he
said
we
want
a
leader
who
can
see
these
things
no
blame
to
osric
therein
for
it
was
his
first
fight
then
the
bishop
laughed
softly
in
a
strange
way
though
his
eyes
still
flashed
and
he
seemed
to
put
the
matter
by
truly
said
he
with
you
wulfhere
to
advise
and
myself
to
ask
questions
and
heregar
to
prevent
our
running
away
i
think
we
might
do
great
things
well
there
is
eanulf
who
fought
at
charnmouth
so
saying
he
rose
up
and
clapped
his
hands
loudly
the
old
man
had
fallen
to
telling
his
beads
and
paid
no
attention
to
him
or
us
any
longer
doubtless
dreaming
of
the
burning
of
his
abbey
over
his
head
unless
some
stronger
help
was
at
hand
than
that
of
the
three
men
before
him
a
lay
brother
came
in
to
answer
the
bishop
summons
take
these
thanes
to
the
refectory
he
said
and
care
for
them
with
all
honour
in
two
hours
i
will
speak
with
them
again
or
sooner
if
osric
messenger
comes
i
am
no
thane
said
wulfhere
not
willing
to
be
mistaken
i
am
bishop
of
sherborne
said
he
smiling
in
an
absent
way
and
waving
his
hand
for
us
to
go
so
we
went
and
thereafter
were
splendidly
treated
as
most
honoured
guests
even
to
the
replacing
of
the
broad
hat
which
wulfhere
had
gotten
from
the
franklin
by
a
plain
steel
helm
with
other
changes
of
garment
for
which
we
were
most
glad
now
as
we
bathed
and
changed
i
found
that
letter
which
leofwine
the
hermit
priest
had
given
me
and
i
prayed
the
brother
to
give
it
to
the
bishop
at
some
proper
moment
and
he
took
it
away
with
him
i
had
forgotten
it
in
the
greater
business
while
we
ate
and
drank
and
talked
of
how
to
reach
eanulf
the
ealdorman
the
brother
came
back
and
brought
us
a
message
saying
the
bishop
bids
you
rest
here
in
peace
he
has
sent
messengers
to
eanulf
bidding
him
come
here
in
all
haste
to
speak
with
him
and
you
so
i
asked
where
he
was
and
the
brother
said
that
he
lay
at
wells
which
pleased
wulfhere
who
said
that
he
would
be
here
shortly
and
that
we
were
in
luck
seeing
that
he
wanted
another
good
night
rest
and
indeed
so
did
i
sorely
though
that
i
might
yet
stay
near
alswythe
was
better
still
before
the
two
hours
the
bishop
had
set
there
was
a
clamour
in
the
great
yard
and
we
thought
the
messenger
from
osric
had
surely
come
and
so
it
was
for
almost
directly
the
bishop
sent
for
us
and
we
were
taken
back
to
the
same
chamber
but
he
was
alone
now
and
motioned
us
to
seats
beside
him
to
one
side
then
they
brought
in
a
thane
whom
i
did
not
know
and
he
said
he
was
a
messenger
from
osric
laying
a
letter
on
the
table
at
the
same
time
i
saw
that
his
armour
was
battle
stained
and
that
he
looked
sorely
downcast
not
so
the
bishop
as
he
read
for
that
which
was
written
he
had
already
expected
and
he
never
changed
his
set
look
once
he
read
the
letter
through
and
then
again
aloud
for
us
to
hear
thus
it
ran
after
fit
greeting
now
what
befell
in
the
first
fight
you
know
or
shall
know
shortly
from
our
trusty
messenger
heregar
by
whom
the
flight
was
stayed
from
that
field
on
the
hill
of
cannington
and
this
was
well
done
so
seeing
that
the
danes
had
drawn
off
i
myself
foolishly
deeming
the
matter
at
an
end
left
three
hundred
men
on
that
hill
to
watch
the
danes
back
to
their
ships
and
returned
to
the
town
there
to
muster
again
the
men
who
were
sound
and
if
it
were
possible
to
lead
them
on
the
danes
as
they
went
on
board
again
to
depart
for
the
men
save
those
of
bridgwater
would
not
bide
on
the
hill
but
came
back
saving
the
danes
would
surely
depart
and
indeed
i
also
thought
so
but
wrongly
for
even
as
i
talked
with
heregar
of
his
own
affairs
news
came
of
a
fresh
attack
whereon
i
sent
him
to
you
fearing
the
worst
for
the
men
on
the
hill
were
few
and
those
in
the
town
seeming
of
little
spirit
now
when
i
came
three
parts
of
the
way
to
cannington
our
men
there
were
sped
and
driven
back
on
us
whereupon
i
could
no
longer
hold
together
any
force
and
whither
the
men
are
scattered
i
know
not
scarcely
could
i
save
the
holy
women
and
the
monks
for
even
as
they
fled
under
guard
into
the
quantock
woods
and
so
to
go
beyond
the
hills
the
houses
of
bridgwater
next
the
danes
were
burning
now
am
i
with
two
hundred
men
on
brent
and
wait
either
for
the
danes
to
depart
or
for
orders
from
yourself
or
the
ealdorman
eanulf
to
whom
i
pray
you
let
this
letter
be
sent
in
haste
after
that
you
have
read
it
so
it
ended
with
salutations
and
when
he
had
read
it
the
bishop
folded
it
slowly
and
looked
at
the
thane
who
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
and
said
true
words
lord
bishop
and
all
told
it
is
what
i
expected
said
ealhstan
these
two
thanes
told
me
it
was
like
to
be
thus
surely
answered
the
thane
what
else
the
bishop
looked
at
him
and
asked
him
his
name
wislac
the
thane
of
gatehampton
by
the
thames
am
i
he
said
a
stranger
here
having
come
on
my
own
affairs
to
bridgwater
and
so
joining
in
the
fight
also
osric
thanes
having
trouble
enough
on
hand
i
rode
with
this
letter
thanks
therefor
said
the
bishop
i
see
that
you
fought
also
in
a
place
where
blows
were
thick
aye
in
the
first
fight
said
wislac
as
for
the
second
being
with
osric
i
never
saw
that
did
you
stay
on
the
hill
where
men
rallied
that
did
i
as
any
man
would
when
the
saints
came
to
stay
us
otherwise
i
had
surely
halted
at
bridgwater
or
this
side
thereof
answered
the
strange
thane
with
a
smile
that
was
bitter
enough
now
the
bishop
had
not
heard
that
tale
of
the
saint
on
a
white
horse
but
he
was
quick
enough
and
glanced
aside
at
me
whereupon
wislac
the
thane
looked
also
and
straightway
his
mouth
opened
and
he
stared
at
me
then
being
nowise
afraid
of
the
bishop
or
as
it
seemed
of
saints
he
said
aloud
seemingly
to
himself
never
saw
i
bishop
before
still
i
knew
that
they
were
blessed
with
visions
but
that
live
saints
should
sit
below
their
seat
i
dreamt
not
and
so
he
went
on
staring
at
me
so
the
bishop
for
all
his
trouble
could
but
smile
and
asked
him
if
he
saw
a
vision
surely
he
said
this
is
the
saint
who
stayed
us
on
yonder
hill
nay
that
is
heregar
the
thane
messenger
of
osric
then
said
wislac
let
me
tell
you
heregar
the
thane
that
one
of
the
saints
and
i
think
a
valiant
one
is
mightily
like
you
whereby
you
are
the
more
fortunate
now
for
all
the
mistake
i
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
and
was
fain
to
thank
him
for
the
good
word
on
my
looks
yet
he
went
on
looking
at
me
now
and
then
in
a
puzzled
sort
of
way
and
the
bishop
seemed
to
enjoy
his
wonderment
but
was
in
no
mind
to
enlighten
him
presently
the
bishop
bade
wislac
sit
down
and
then
he
took
up
ring
that
i
had
given
him
and
also
another
which
lay
beside
it
on
the
table
silver
also
with
some
device
on
it
like
that
i
had
worn
see
thanes
he
said
have
you
three
a
mind
to
stay
with
me
for
a
while
and
be
my
council
in
this
matter
for
i
am
here
without
a
fighting
man
of
my
own
to
speak
with
now
this
was
what
i
would
most
wish
and
i
said
so
eagerly
and
with
thanks
and
wislac
said
that
he
was
surely
in
good
company
and
having
nought
to
call
him
home
would
gladly
stay
also
then
said
the
bishop
stranger
you
are
friend
wislac
and
therefore
wear
this
ring
of
osric
that
men
may
pay
heed
to
you
as
his
friend
and
mine
and
do
you
heregar
wear
this
of
mine
that
men
may
know
you
for
bishop
man
and
so
respect
your
word
so
was
i
put
under
the
bishop
protection
and
he
would
answer
for
my
presence
in
wessex
to
all
and
any
that
was
good
and
i
felt
a
free
man
again
in
truth
for
here
was
no
errand
that
would
end
as
osric
was
ended
when
i
had
seen
eanulf
now
wulfhere
had
not
spoken
and
the
bishop
asked
him
if
he
too
would
not
stay
ay
lord
answered
wulfhere
gladly
but
you
spoke
of
thanes
only
when
the
bishop
of
sherborne
names
one
as
a
thane
said
ealhstan
smiling
men
are
apt
to
hold
him
as
such
but
only
to
the
worthy
are
such
words
spoken
now
friend
wulfhere
i
have
heard
of
you
at
charnmouth
fight
and
also
there
is
more
in
osric
letter
than
i
have
read
to
you
so
if
you
will
be
but
a
bishop
landless
thane
surely
you
shall
be
one
then
wulfhere
grew
red
with
pleasure
and
rising
up
did
obeisance
to
the
bishop
for
the
honour
and
the
bishop
called
us
two
others
to
witness
that
the
same
was
given
now
is
my
council
set
he
said
i
to
ask
questions
and
you
to
advise
so
for
a
long
two
hours
we
sat
and
told
him
all
we
knew
of
those
danes
i
of
the
ships
and
wulfhere
and
wislac
of
numbers
and
wulfhere
of
their
ways
in
raiding
a
country
for
this
he
had
seen
before
in
dorset
and
also
in
ireland
as
he
told
us
in
years
gone
by
that
night
we
were
treated
as
most
honoured
guests
of
the
bishop
own
following
and
early
in
the
morning
the
bishop
sent
for
me
before
mass
once
again
i
found
him
alone
in
that
room
of
his
and
all
he
said
to
me
i
can
not
write
down
but
i
found
that
leofwine
the
hermit
had
told
him
of
how
i
had
taken
counsel
of
him
and
abided
by
it
even
as
ealhstan
himself
had
bidden
me
and
moreover
that
osric
had
written
in
his
letter
of
what
i
had
been
able
to
do
against
the
danes
and
of
matelgar
last
words
concerning
me
and
for
that
remembrance
of
me
according
to
his
promise
even
when
writing
of
far
greater
matters
i
am
ever
grateful
to
the
good
sheriff
so
because
of
these
things
known
ealhstan
spoke
to
me
as
a
most
loving
father
praising
me
where
it
seemed
that
praise
was
due
and
reproving
me
for
the
many
things
of
deed
and
thought
that
were
evil
and
i
told
him
freely
and
fully
all
that
had
passed
from
the
time
i
left
the
hill
of
brent
till
when
i
had
seen
the
signals
of
the
vikings
from
above
watchet
and
bore
the
war
arrow
to
matelgar
the
rest
he
knew
in
a
way
but
i
opened
all
my
heart
to
him
he
drawing
all
from
me
most
gently
till
at
last
i
came
to
my
dream
of
matelgar
and
my
wish
that
for
me
he
might
rest
in
peace
it
is
not
all
forgiveness
heregar
my
son
he
said
presently
there
is
love
for
alsywthe
and
pride
in
yourself
and
thought
of
failure
which
have
at
least
brought
you
to
a
beginning
of
it
but
true
forgiveness
comes
slowly
and
many
a
long
day
shall
it
be
before
that
has
truly
come
and
i
knew
that
maybe
he
was
right
and
asked
his
help
whereupon
that
was
freely
given
and
in
such
sort
that
all
my
life
long
i
must
mind
the
words
he
said
and
love
him
in
the
memory
when
all
that
was
said
he
would
have
me
hear
mass
with
him
as
though
i
needed
urging
and
there
too
were
wulfhere
and
wislac
and
that
mass
in
the
great
abbey
was
the
most
wonderful
i
ever
heard
after
that
we
three
went
out
into
the
town
and
wislac
and
i
marvelled
at
everything
then
we
went
to
the
nunnery
gates
and
asked
how
our
charges
fared
and
then
saw
to
our
steeds
there
was
the
collier
working
as
a
groom
with
the
other
men
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
learning
his
new
trade
fast
but
would
fain
walk
ever
rather
than
ride
having
fallen
many
times
from
the
abbess
mule
which
he
had
bestridden
in
anxiety
to
learn
whether
the
mule
was
the
better
for
this
lesson
i
doubt
when
we
went
back
to
the
abbey
eanulf
had
come
and
with
him
many
thanes
and
i
feared
to
meet
these
somewhat
for
they
might
have
been
among
the
moot
and
would
know
me
yet
ealhstan
had
foreseen
this
and
one
was
posted
at
the
door
to
meet
me
bidding
me
aside
privately
since
the
bishop
needed
me
wulfhere
and
wislac
went
into
the
hall
and
left
me
therefore
and
i
was
taken
to
a
chamber
where
were
six
or
seven
lay
brethren
who
asked
me
many
things
about
the
fight
and
specially
at
last
about
the
saint
who
had
appeared
and
that
was
likely
to
be
a
troublesome
question
for
me
as
i
could
not
claim
to
have
been
the
one
so
mistaken
but
another
struck
in
saying
that
there
were
many
strange
portents
about
for
that
a
fiend
had
appeared
bodily
from
the
marsh
and
had
devoured
a
child
in
sedgemoor
now
it
seems
that
fiends
are
rarer
than
saints
among
these
holy
men
and
they
forgot
the
first
wonder
and
ran
on
about
the
second
not
thinking
that
i
could
have
told
them
of
that
also
and
at
last
one
fetched
a
great
book
as
i
thought
in
some
secrecy
and
made
thereout
nothing
more
nor
less
than
parts
of
the
song
of
beowulf
itself
and
all
about
grendel
which
pleased
us
all
well
and
so
we
were
quiet
enough
listening
and
it
happened
that
while
we
were
all
intent
on
this
reading
and
i
never
heard
one
read
as
brother
guthlac
read
to
us
the
came
in
to
call
me
and
pulling
back
the
hangings
of
the
doorway
stood
listening
where
i
could
see
him
first
of
all
he
looked
pleased
to
find
his
people
so
employed
then
when
the
crash
of
the
fighting
verses
came
to
his
ears
he
started
a
little
and
looked
round
the
good
brothers
were
like
to
forget
their
frocks
for
their
fists
were
clenched
and
their
eyes
sparkled
and
their
teeth
were
set
and
verily
i
believe
each
man
of
them
thought
himself
one
of
beowulf
comrades
if
not
the
hero
himself
whereupon
the
and
i
were
presently
grinning
at
one
another
ho
said
he
all
of
a
sudden
now
were
i
swithun
where
would
you
heathens
spend
tonight
surely
in
the
cells
then
for
a
moment
they
thought
grendel
had
indeed
come
such
power
has
verse
like
this
in
the
mouth
of
a
good
reader
and
they
started
up
one
and
all
and
the
reader
saw
who
it
was
and
that
there
was
no
hiding
the
book
from
him
so
they
stood
agape
and
terrified
for
by
this
time
the
good
man
had
managed
to
look
mighty
stern
good
father
said
i
seeing
that
someone
must
needs
speak
i
am
but
a
fighting
man
and
the
brothers
were
considering
my
weakness
h
said
the
seeming
in
great
wrath
is
there
no
fighting
to
be
read
from
holy
writ
that
you
must
take
these
pagan
vanities
from
where
you
ought
not
go
to
yet
by
reason
of
your
care
for
the
thane
your
penance
shall
be
light
now
and
not
heavy
hereafter
brother
guthlac
shall
read
aloud
in
refectory
today
the
story
of
david
and
goliath
and
you
brother
pointing
to
one
that
of
ahab
at
ramoth
and
you
of
joshua
at
jericho
and
so
he
went
on
till
each
had
a
chapter
of
war
assigned
him
and
i
thought
it
an
easy
penance
but
he
added
and
until
all
these
are
read
your
meals
shall
be
untasted
before
you
then
the
brothers
looked
at
one
another
for
it
was
certain
that
all
this
reading
would
last
till
the
meal
must
be
left
for
vespers
then
the
bade
the
reader
take
back
the
book
and
go
to
his
own
cell
and
beckoning
me
we
passed
out
and
left
the
brothers
in
much
dismay
not
knowing
what
should
befall
them
from
the
abbot
when
he
heard
so
i
ventured
to
tell
the
how
this
came
about
and
he
smiled
saying
that
he
should
not
tell
tatwine
the
abbot
for
the
brothers
were
seldom
in
much
fault
and
that
maybe
it
was
laudable
to
search
even
pagan
books
for
the
manners
of
fiends
seeing
that
forewarned
was
forearmed
then
he
said
that
surely
he
wished
but
this
i
need
tell
none
else
that
he
had
been
there
in
my
place
to
hear
guthlac
read
it
also
that
he
was
minded
to
make
the
old
rhyme
more
if
he
could
writing
parts
of
it
afresh
and
this
he
has
done
since
so
that
any
man
may
read
it
but
it
is
not
so
good
as
the
old
one
ix
now
we
came
to
the
bishop
chamber
and
he
went
in
calling
me
after
him
in
a
minute
or
so
i
could
hear
ealhstan
voice
and
that
of
another
as
i
waited
outside
the
other
was
eanulf
the
ealdorman
and
as
i
entered
he
rose
up
and
faced
me
so
heregar
he
said
you
are
bishop
man
now
and
out
of
my
power
i
am
glad
of
it
and
so
saying
he
reached
me
out
his
hand
and
wrung
mine
and
looked
very
friendly
as
he
did
so
i
have
heard
of
your
doings
he
said
and
thank
you
for
them
and
i
will
see
this
matter
of
yours
looked
into
for
i
think
as
the
bishop
believes
that
there
has
been
a
plot
against
you
for
plain
reasons
enough
however
that
must
stand
over
as
yet
but
come
with
me
to
the
hall
and
i
will
right
you
with
the
thanes
there
at
that
i
thanked
him
knowing
that
things
were
going
right
with
me
and
the
bishop
smiled
as
well
pleased
but
said
nothing
as
eanulf
took
me
by
the
arm
and
we
went
together
to
the
great
hall
where
the
thanes
some
twenty
of
them
were
talking
together
at
once
i
saw
several
whose
faces
had
burnt
themselves
as
it
were
into
my
mind
at
the
moot
but
none
of
matelgar
friends
among
them
they
were
quiet
when
their
leader
went
in
and
he
wasted
no
time
but
spoke
in
his
own
direct
way
see
here
thanes
here
is
heregar
whom
we
outlawed
but
the
other
day
take
my
word
and
ealhstan
and
osric
for
it
that
there
was
a
mistake
we
know
now
that
there
is
no
truer
man
for
he
has
proved
it
as
some
of
you
being
the
man
who
lit
the
huts
at
stert
in
face
of
the
danes
and
being
likewise
the
saint
of
cannington
aye
it
is
so
said
several
voices
and
others
laughed
then
like
honest
saxons
as
they
were
they
came
crowding
and
laughing
to
shake
hands
with
an
outlawed
saint
as
one
said
so
that
i
was
overdone
almost
with
their
kindness
and
knew
not
what
to
say
or
do
but
eanulf
pushed
me
forward
among
them
saying
that
i
being
man
was
no
more
concern
of
his
outlaw
or
no
outlaw
and
that
saints
were
beyond
him
so
he
too
laughed
and
went
back
to
the
bishop
and
i
found
wulfhere
and
wislac
and
soon
i
was
one
of
my
own
sort
again
and
the
bad
past
seemed
very
far
away
but
wislac
looked
at
me
and
said
you
have
spoilt
a
fine
tale
i
had
to
take
home
with
me
but
maybe
i
need
not
tell
the
ending
howbeit
i
always
did
hold
that
there
was
none
so
much
difference
between
a
fighting
saint
and
one
of
ourselves
and
that
seemed
to
satisfy
him
chapter
xii
the
great
levy
it
was
not
long
before
eanulf
made
up
his
mind
to
action
and
he
was
closeted
with
the
bishop
all
that
morning
then
after
the
midday
meal
he
called
a
council
of
all
who
were
there
and
we
sat
in
the
great
hall
to
hear
his
plans
ealhstan
came
with
him
and
these
two
sat
at
the
upper
end
of
the
hall
and
we
on
the
benches
round
the
walls
for
the
long
tables
had
been
cleared
when
all
was
ready
eanulf
stood
up
and
told
the
thanes
for
some
were
men
who
had
had
no
part
in
osric
levy
all
about
the
fighting
and
how
it
had
ended
and
having
done
that
he
asked
for
the
advice
of
such
as
would
have
aught
to
say
very
soon
an
old
thane
rose
up
and
said
that
he
thought
all
would
be
well
if
forces
were
so
posted
as
to
prevent
the
danes
coming
beyond
the
land
they
then
held
and
several
growled
assent
to
that
and
one
said
that
danes
bided
in
one
place
no
long
time
but
would
take
ship
again
and
go
elsewhere
that
too
seemed
to
please
most
and
i
saw
eanulf
bite
his
lip
for
he
was
a
man
who
loved
action
and
wulfhere
too
shifted
in
his
seat
as
if
impatient
then
they
went
back
to
the
first
proposal
and
began
to
name
places
where
men
might
be
posted
to
keep
the
danes
in
parret
valley
at
least
till
they
went
away
then
at
last
wulfhere
grew
angry
and
rose
up
looking
very
red
and
what
think
you
will
parret
valley
be
like
when
they
have
done
their
will
therein
does
no
man
remember
the
going
back
to
his
place
when
these
strangers
had
bided
in
it
for
a
while
after
they
beat
us
in
dorset
there
were
two
thanes
who
had
lands
in
that
part
and
they
flushed
so
that
one
might
easily
know
they
remembered
but
they
said
naught
then
eanulf
spake
very
plainly
i
am
for
raising
the
levy
of
somerset
again
and
stronger
and
driving
them
out
but
i
can
not
do
it
without
your
help
then
there
was
silence
and
the
thanes
looked
at
one
another
for
so
long
that
i
waxed
impatient
and
being
headstrong
maybe
got
up
and
spoke
landless
i
am
and
maybe
not
to
be
hearkened
to
but
nevertheless
i
will
say
what
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
should
say
into
this
land
of
peace
these
men
from
over
seas
have
come
wantonly
slaying
our
friends
burning
our
houses
driving
our
cattle
making
such
as
escape
them
take
to
the
woods
like
hunted
wild
beasts
where
is
edred
the
thane
where
is
matelgar
where
twenty
others
you
called
friends
dead
by
combwich
and
none
to
bury
them
the
danes
have
their
arms
the
wolves
their
bodies
is
no
vengeance
to
be
taken
for
this
or
shall
the
danes
sail
away
laughing
saying
that
the
hearts
of
the
saxons
are
as
water
then
there
rose
an
angry
growl
at
that
and
i
was
glad
to
hear
it
so
was
eanulf
as
it
seemed
and
wulfhere
got
up
and
stood
beside
me
and
spoke
this
is
good
talk
and
now
i
will
add
a
word
why
came
back
the
danes
here
because
after
we
were
beaten
before
we
let
them
do
their
worst
and
hindered
them
not
therefore
come
they
back
even
now
aye
and
if
we
drive
them
not
from
us
hither
will
they
come
yet
again
till
we
may
not
call
the
land
our
own
from
year
to
year
i
say
with
the
ealdorman
let
us
up
and
drive
them
out
showing
them
what
saxons
are
made
of
what
are
we
done
fighting
after
they
have
scattered
one
hastily
gathered
levy
shame
there
is
none
to
us
in
being
so
beaten
once
but
i
hold
it
shame
to
let
them
so
easily
have
the
mastery
then
there
was
a
murmur
but
not
all
of
assent
though
i
could
see
that
many
would
side
with
us
whereon
wislac
rose
up
slowly
and
looking
round
said
i
am
a
stranger
but
having
been
present
at
the
beating
the
other
day
yonder
am
minded
to
see
if
i
may
yet
go
home
on
the
winning
side
and
it
would
be
shame
even
as
these
two
thanes
have
said
not
to
give
a
guest
a
chance
to
have
his
pleasure
i
pray
you
thanes
pluck
up
spirit
and
follow
the
ealdorman
now
though
wislac
words
seemed
idle
at
the
beginning
there
was
that
in
his
last
words
which
brought
several
of
the
younger
thanes
to
their
feet
looking
angrily
at
him
and
one
asked
if
he
meant
to
call
that
assembly
nidring
not
i
said
wislac
smiling
peacefully
seeing
that
you
have
done
naught
to
deserve
that
foul
name
but
being
a
beaten
man
as
i
said
i
need
a
chance
to
prove
that
i
am
not
myself
so
please
you
and
they
could
not
take
offence
at
his
tone
yet
they
saw
well
what
he
meant
and
this
in
the
end
touched
them
very
closely
for
they
were
in
the
same
case
as
he
but
with
more
right
being
of
somerset
to
wipe
out
their
defeat
but
maybe
there
would
have
been
a
quarrel
if
eanulf
had
not
spoken
peace
thanes
he
said
heregar
is
right
and
we
must
avenge
our
dead
wulfhere
is
right
and
for
the
land
sake
we
must
give
these
danes
a
lesson
to
bide
at
home
wislac
is
right
and
this
defeat
must
be
wiped
out
now
say
if
you
will
help
me
to
raise
the
levy
afresh
aye
we
will
said
the
thanes
but
there
was
not
that
heartiness
in
their
tones
that
one
might
have
looked
for
in
truth
though
it
was
no
want
of
courage
but
the
thought
of
the
easier
plan
of
waiting
that
held
them
back
then
ealhstan
the
bishop
rose
up
and
faced
us
all
with
his
eyes
shining
and
his
right
hand
gripping
his
crosier
so
tightly
that
his
knuckles
shone
white
what
my
sons
shall
it
be
said
of
you
as
it
is
said
of
us
dorset
folk
that
you
let
the
danes
bide
in
your
land
and
work
their
worst
on
you
and
yours
i
tell
you
that
since
we
went
back
and
saw
as
we
still
see
their
track
over
our
homes
our
folk
burn
to
take
revenge
on
them
and
i
being
what
i
am
think
no
wrong
of
counselling
revenge
on
heathen
folk
listen
for
ye
are
men
and
then
he
told
us
in
burning
words
such
a
tale
of
what
must
be
were
these
heathen
to
have
their
way
such
things
that
he
himself
had
seen
and
known
after
charnmouth
fight
that
we
would
fain
at
last
be
up
and
drive
them
away
without
waiting
for
the
levy
and
at
last
he
said
eanulf
this
will
i
do
i
will
gather
the
dorset
levy
and
lead
them
to
your
help
and
so
will
we
make
short
work
of
these
heathen
then
all
the
thanes
shouted
that
they
would
not
be
behind
in
the
matter
and
so
their
cool
saxon
blood
was
fired
to
that
white
rage
which
is
quenched
but
in
victory
or
death
now
after
that
there
was
talk
of
nothing
but
of
making
the
levy
as
soon
as
might
be
and
eanulf
thanking
everyone
and
most
of
all
the
bishop
straightway
gave
his
orders
and
before
that
night
the
war
arrow
was
speeding
through
all
somerset
and
dorset
likewise
and
word
was
sent
to
osric
and
the
other
sheriffs
that
the
gathering
place
named
was
at
the
hill
of
brent
now
of
those
days
that
followed
there
is
little
to
say
the
other
thanes
left
each
to
gather
his
own
men
vowing
vengeance
on
the
danes
but
before
they
went
there
was
hardly
one
who
did
not
seek
out
wulfhere
wislac
and
myself
and
in
some
way
or
another
tell
us
that
we
had
spoken
right
one
fiery
young
thane
indeed
was
minded
to
fight
wislac
but
the
mercian
turned
the
quarrel
very
skilfully
and
in
the
end
agreed
with
the
thane
that
the
matter
should
be
settled
by
the
number
of
danes
each
should
slay
which
said
wislac
will
be
as
good
sport
and
more
profitable
than
pounding
one
another
and
quite
as
good
proof
that
neither
of
us
may
be
held
nidring
so
that
ended
very
well
but
every
day
came
in
reports
brought
by
fugitives
of
the
danes
and
their
doings
which
made
our
blood
boil
at
last
came
one
who
brought
a
message
for
myself
could
i
be
found
it
was
from
the
aunt
of
alswythe
the
prioress
of
bridgwater
telling
of
her
safety
and
that
of
her
nuns
at
taunton
and
i
begged
the
bishop
to
let
me
tell
this
good
news
to
alswythe
and
so
gained
speech
with
her
once
more
yet
would
the
abbess
be
present
reading
the
while
but
i
might
tell
my
love
all
that
had
befallen
me
and
she
rejoiced
bidding
me
go
fight
and
win
myself
renown
in
the
good
cause
of
my
own
country
and
when
i
left
her
i
felt
that
i
must
indeed
be
strong
for
the
sake
of
her
and
by
reason
of
her
words
which
would
be
in
my
mind
ever
now
one
day
when
i
went
to
see
the
horses
and
ride
out
with
wulfhere
and
wislac
the
collier
came
and
hung
about
seeming
to
wish
to
ask
somewhat
and
when
i
noticed
this
and
bade
him
speak
he
prayed
me
that
i
would
give
him
arms
and
let
him
follow
me
to
the
coming
fighting
arms
save
those
i
wore
i
had
none
but
i
promised
him
such
as
i
could
buy
him
with
what
remained
of
the
money
i
had
found
which
might
be
enough
seeing
that
we
lived
at
free
quarters
with
the
bishop
and
had
little
expense
as
for
the
other
money
i
left
that
with
the
abbess
after
i
had
seen
alswythe
for
it
was
less
mine
than
hers
but
i
asked
dudda
if
he
were
able
to
use
a
sword
whereupon
he
grinned
and
said
that
brother
guthlac
tended
the
abbot
mule
and
had
taught
him
much
when
he
came
to
the
stables
daily
he
also
showed
me
a
bruised
arm
and
broken
head
in
token
of
hard
play
with
the
ash
plant
between
them
here
is
the
said
guthlac
said
wulfhere
and
there
was
the
reader
of
beowulf
coming
with
frock
and
sleeves
tucked
up
from
out
the
stables
so
i
called
him
and
asked
him
to
try
a
bout
with
the
collier
telling
him
why
at
first
he
denied
all
knowledge
of
carnal
warfare
but
i
reminded
him
of
his
reading
of
beowulf
saying
that
if
he
knew
naught
of
fighting
the
verses
would
have
had
none
of
that
fire
in
them
so
in
the
end
they
went
to
it
and
i
saw
that
guthlac
was
well
used
to
sword
play
and
was
satisfied
also
with
his
pupil
then
i
asked
guthlac
whence
he
got
his
skill
in
arms
and
why
he
was
shut
up
thus
inside
four
walls
laziness
thane
he
answered
telling
me
nothing
of
the
first
matter
at
all
nor
would
he
but
i
found
afterwards
that
he
had
been
lamed
once
and
tended
by
the
monks
and
so
had
bided
in
the
abbey
liking
the
life
though
he
had
been
a
stout
housecarle
to
some
thane
or
other
then
wislac
must
ask
him
if
there
were
any
more
of
his
sort
in
the
abbey
and
seeing
that
we
meant
no
harm
and
looking
on
me
as
an
ally
in
that
matter
of
the
reading
he
said
there
were
five
more
whom
heregar
the
thane
knew
if
he
would
remember
reading
certain
scriptures
at
supper
time
and
i
found
that
these
six
kindred
spirits
had
managed
to
get
themselves
told
off
to
amuse
me
while
i
waited
that
day
so
that
they
might
hear
of
the
fighting
so
we
laughed
and
rode
out
and
i
thought
no
more
of
guthlac
and
his
brethren
till
the
time
came
when
i
remembered
them
gladly
all
day
long
during
that
week
came
pouring
in
the
dorset
levies
in
answer
to
the
bishop
summons
hard
and
wiry
men
they
were
and
as
i
could
well
see
a
very
much
harder
set
than
osric
first
levy
for
these
were
veterans
ealhstan
word
had
gone
out
that
all
men
who
would
wipe
out
the
defeat
of
charnmouth
should
gather
to
him
and
these
were
the
men
who
had
fought
there
and
only
longed
to
try
their
strength
again
against
their
conquerors
of
that
disastrous
day
day
by
day
also
would
ealhstan
go
out
into
the
marketplace
and
there
speak
burning
words
to
them
bidding
them
remember
the
days
gone
by
and
the
valour
of
their
fathers
who
won
the
land
for
them
and
to
have
ever
in
mind
that
this
war
was
not
of
christian
against
christian
but
against
heathen
men
who
were
profaning
the
houses
of
god
wherever
they
came
many
more
things
did
he
say
ever
finding
something
fresh
wherewith
to
stir
their
courage
but
ever
also
did
he
bid
them
remember
how
the
danes
had
won
by
discipline
more
than
courage
and
to
pay
heed
to
that
as
their
leaders
bade
them
also
day
by
day
he
bade
the
thanes
who
had
seen
fighting
train
their
men
as
well
as
they
might
and
they
worked
well
at
that
moreover
he
could
teach
them
much
reading
to
us
at
times
from
a
great
latin
book
of
the
wars
of
caesar
such
things
as
seemed
like
to
be
useful
putting
it
into
good
saxon
as
he
went
on
then
as
the
week
drew
to
an
end
there
began
to
be
questions
as
to
who
should
be
leader
of
the
dorset
men
and
many
said
that
osric
should
be
the
man
for
he
was
an
ealdorman
of
dorset
but
when
the
bishop
sent
to
brent
for
him
and
asked
him
to
lead
his
men
osric
doubted
and
what
he
said
to
the
other
thanes
and
to
us
three
made
them
send
us
to
the
bishop
with
somewhat
to
ask
so
we
finding
him
ever
ready
to
hear
what
was
wanted
put
the
question
to
him
plainly
as
they
had
bidden
us
and
that
was
that
he
himself
should
lead
the
levy
of
dorset
now
tatwine
the
old
abbot
sat
with
him
and
heard
this
and
straightway
he
began
to
tremble
and
cry
out
that
such
work
was
unfit
for
a
bishop
so
the
bishop
said
to
me
very
quietly
but
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
which
seemed
to
show
that
this
was
what
he
longed
for
heregar
my
son
go
and
tell
the
thanes
what
the
abbot
says
and
ask
if
they
will
go
without
me
all
the
thanes
were
waiting
to
hear
the
bishop
answer
to
our
request
and
i
told
them
this
and
they
knew
at
once
what
answer
to
give
for
they
said
or
osric
said
for
them
while
all
applauded
we
will
not
go
against
these
heathens
unless
the
bishop
leads
us
else
must
somerset
fight
her
own
battles
so
with
that
word
i
went
back
to
the
bishop
and
told
him
so
tatwine
my
brother
you
see
how
it
is
needs
must
that
i
go
else
were
it
shame
to
us
that
heathen
men
should
have
freedom
in
a
christian
land
but
tatwine
groaned
and
maybe
knowing
the
bishop
well
said
no
more
then
ealhstan
bade
him
remember
all
the
saints
who
had
warred
against
the
heathen
and
were
held
blameless
nay
rather
the
holier
therefore
said
he
i
am
in
good
company
and
will
surely
go
whereupon
tatwine
rose
up
and
went
out
saying
that
he
should
go
to
the
abbey
and
seek
protection
for
the
bishop
and
men
say
he
bided
there
almost
night
and
day
praying
until
all
was
past
certainly
i
saw
him
no
more
in
his
accustomed
places
save
at
mass
when
he
had
gone
the
bishop
smiled
a
little
looking
after
him
and
then
spoke
to
us
i
may
tell
my
council
that
this
is
what
i
should
love
nevertheless
it
will
not
be
i
who
lead
but
you
three
for
the
counsel
must
be
wulfhere
and
the
coolness
wislac
and
the
rest
heregar
who
will
by
no
means
bide
that
we
run
away
now
i
think
that
you
three
will
make
a
good
leader
of
me
on
that
we
thanked
him
for
his
words
and
we
followed
him
out
to
the
hall
and
there
the
thanes
shouted
and
cheered
as
he
came
and
still
more
when
he
prayed
them
to
follow
him
to
victory
or
a
warrior
death
and
that
they
swore
to
do
not
loudly
but
in
such
sort
that
none
could
mistake
that
they
would
surely
do
so
then
he
bade
them
muster
their
men
by
the
first
light
in
the
morning
and
so
he
would
lead
them
first
of
all
to
brent
to
join
the
ealdorman
and
osric
should
be
his
second
in
command
that
pleased
all
and
soon
we
were
left
alone
with
him
again
but
we
could
hear
outside
the
cheering
of
men
now
and
then
as
some
thane
gathered
his
following
and
told
them
the
name
of
their
leader
so
we
three
went
out
presently
and
saw
to
our
horses
and
then
i
was
wondering
about
arms
for
dudda
for
i
had
left
the
matter
too
long
and
it
seemed
there
were
few
weapons
remaining
for
sale
in
the
town
by
reason
of
men
of
the
levy
buying
or
borrowing
what
they
lacked
in
equipment
and
the
poor
fellow
hung
about
sadly
thinking
he
should
find
none
in
the
end
and
swearing
he
would
follow
me
even
had
he
naught
but
a
quarterstaff
in
his
hand
but
when
we
went
back
to
the
abbey
the
bishop
sent
for
us
and
we
were
taken
into
a
room
we
had
not
seen
before
and
there
on
the
table
were
laid
out
three
suits
of
mail
helmets
and
arms
now
said
ealhstan
as
he
saw
our
eyes
go
as
a
man
eyes
will
straight
to
these
things
if
you
thanes
are
not
too
proud
to
accept
such
as
i
can
give
let
me
arm
you
and
tell
you
where
you
shall
bear
these
arms
and
that
was
what
we
longed
for
for
as
yet
we
had
no
post
in
the
levy
and
we
told
him
as
much
that
is
well
he
answered
see
wislac
here
is
bright
steel
armour
and
helm
and
shield
for
you
sword
also
if
you
need
it
for
maybe
you
will
scarce
part
from
your
own
tried
weapon
but
wislac
smiled
at
that
and
took
hold
of
his
sword
hilt
loosening
the
strings
which
bound
it
to
the
sheath
there
were
but
eight
inches
of
blade
left
and
these
were
sorely
notched
aha
quoth
the
bishop
now
know
i
why
wislac
thought
well
to
stop
fighting
the
other
day
which
pleased
the
mercian
well
enough
then
wulfhere
went
on
ealhstan
here
is
this
black
armour
and
helm
and
shield
for
you
and
sword
or
axe
as
you
will
and
wulfhere
thanked
him
taking
the
axe
as
his
own
sword
was
good
now
heregar
my
son
this
is
yours
said
the
bishop
looking
kindly
at
me
and
as
i
looked
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
more
beautiful
arms
no
better
were
they
than
the
other
two
suits
for
all
three
were
of
good
sussex
ring
mail
as
to
the
byrnies
x
while
the
helms
were
of
hammered
steel
but
mine
was
silver
white
with
gold
collar
and
gold
circles
round
the
arms
gold
too
was
the
of
the
helm
and
gold
the
circle
round
the
head
and
to
me
it
seemed
as
i
looked
that
this
was
too
good
and
ealhstan
knew
my
thoughts
and
answered
them
black
for
the
man
of
dark
counsel
bright
steel
for
the
warrior
and
armour
for
the
man
who
brings
back
hope
when
all
seems
lost
that
is
good
said
wislac
now
read
us
the
meaning
of
the
gold
thereon
also
for
he
seemed
to
see
that
the
bishop
had
some
meaning
in
that
whereat
the
bishop
smiled
gold
for
trust
he
said
and
for
the
man
who
shall
be
honoured
that
is
well
also
said
wulfhere
and
wislac
nodded
gravely
now
said
the
bishop
i
will
put
heregar
out
of
my
council
for
a
minute
so
that
he
may
not
speak
nor
hear
tell
me
thanes
both
if
it
will
be
well
to
give
heregar
the
place
whereto
men
shall
rally
in
need
aye
surely
they
said
we
know
he
can
fill
that
place
then
shall
he
bear
my
standard
said
the
bishop
and
none
will
gainsay
it
and
so
he
turned
to
me
now
heregar
may
you
hear
this
decision
standard
bearer
to
me
shall
you
be
and
i
know
you
will
bear
it
well
and
bravely
and
these
two
your
friends
and
mine
shall
stand
to
right
and
left
of
you
and
six
stout
carles
may
you
choose
from
the
levy
to
stand
before
and
behind
you
and
whom
you
choose
i
will
arm
alike
that
all
may
know
them
now
knew
i
not
what
to
say
or
do
but
i
knelt
before
the
bishop
and
kissed
his
hand
and
so
he
laid
it
on
my
head
and
blessed
me
bidding
me
speak
no
words
of
thanks
but
only
deserve
them
from
him
now
there
was
a
little
silence
after
this
and
wislac
being
ever
ready
broke
it
for
us
much
do
i
marvel
he
said
that
these
suits
of
armour
should
be
so
exactly
fitting
to
each
of
us
surely
there
is
some
magic
in
it
only
the
magic
of
a
wearied
man
sleep
and
of
a
good
weapon
smith
said
the
bishop
laughing
one
measured
your
mail
byrnie
and
helm
both
as
you
slept
we
have
lay
brethren
apt
for
every
craft
and
that
reminded
me
of
brother
guthlac
and
a
thought
came
to
me
father
i
said
six
men
have
you
bidden
me
choose
and
i
know
none
of
the
dorset
men
yet
there
are
six
lay
brethren
here
who
have
been
warriors
of
whom
brother
guthlac
is
one
and
if
they
may
march
against
heathen
men
i
pray
you
let
me
have
them
now
that
the
bishop
seemed
to
find
pleasant
as
though
he
knew
something
of
those
lovers
of
war
songs
and
answered
that
he
wot
not
if
tatwine
would
let
them
go
but
in
any
case
he
would
choose
men
for
me
of
the
best
and
that
we
all
thought
well
knowing
in
what
spirit
he
would
put
those
men
whom
he
should
choose
so
he
bade
us
go
taking
our
arms
with
us
and
we
thanking
him
went
out
but
i
found
my
collier
and
showed
him
the
arms
i
had
been
wearing
saying
they
should
be
his
and
then
took
him
rejoicing
into
the
town
there
i
bought
him
after
some
search
a
plain
good
sword
and
target
which
he
bore
to
his
lodgings
to
scour
and
gaze
at
for
the
rest
of
the
day
chapter
xiii
a
message
from
the
dead
how
shall
i
tell
what
it
was
like
when
the
bishop
standing
aloft
at
the
head
of
the
abbey
steps
with
all
the
monks
round
him
gave
into
my
hands
as
i
knelt
his
standard
to
bear
at
the
head
of
his
men
very
early
in
the
morning
it
was
and
all
the
roofs
were
golden
in
bright
sunlight
and
the
men
drawn
up
in
a
hollow
square
fronting
the
abbey
were
silent
and
attentive
as
mass
was
sung
in
the
great
church
so
that
the
sound
of
the
chanting
came
out
to
them
through
the
open
doors
and
when
the
sacring
xi
bell
rang
as
though
a
wave
went
along
the
ranks
all
knelt
and
there
was
a
clash
and
ring
of
steel
and
then
silence
for
a
space
very
wonderful
then
came
out
when
mass
was
said
bishop
and
thanes
and
monks
and
there
gave
me
the
banner
wulfhere
and
wislac
kneeling
on
either
side
of
me
and
behind
us
those
six
stout
housecarles
whom
the
bishop
had
chosen
and
armed
for
me
so
the
banner
was
given
and
blessed
and
i
rose
up
grasping
the
cross
from
which
it
hung
and
lifted
it
that
all
might
see
then
was
a
great
shout
from
all
the
men
and
swords
were
drawn
and
brandished
on
every
side
and
without
need
of
command
all
the
dorset
host
swore
to
follow
it
even
to
the
death
and
that
was
good
to
hear
but
as
for
me
my
thoughts
were
more
than
i
may
write
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
were
as
those
of
saint
george
when
he
rode
out
to
slay
the
dragon
in
the
old
days
so
great
were
they
after
that
a
little
wait
and
then
the
horses
and
the
bishop
mounted
a
great
bay
charger
managing
him
as
a
master
and
to
me
was
brought
my
white
horse
by
the
collier
looking
a
grim
fighting
man
enough
in
his
arms
and
to
wulfhere
and
wislac
black
and
gray
steeds
given
by
ealhstan
himself
now
the
bishop
rode
followed
by
us
to
the
centre
of
the
levy
and
again
a
great
shout
rose
up
even
mightier
than
that
first
and
when
it
ended
he
spoke
to
the
men
as
he
was
wont
to
speak
but
even
yet
more
freely
and
then
put
himself
at
their
head
and
so
began
the
march
to
brent
and
all
the
town
was
out
to
see
us
go
never
doubting
of
our
victory
nor
thinking
of
how
few
might
return
of
all
that
long
line
of
sturdy
and
valiant
fighting
men
when
we
were
clear
of
the
town
at
last
and
went
the
men
singing
as
they
marched
down
the
ancient
green
lanes
that
had
seen
our
forefathers
levies
and
the
roman
legions
alike
i
had
time
to
look
around
me
at
my
own
following
being
conscious
in
some
way
that
mixed
up
as
it
were
with
the
war
song
there
had
been
the
sound
of
the
droning
of
a
chant
as
by
monks
close
by
me
and
i
could
see
no
monks
near
the
thanes
were
riding
round
and
after
the
bishop
who
came
next
me
as
i
led
the
way
with
the
standard
and
ealhstan
indeed
had
on
his
robes
but
there
was
a
stiffness
about
him
and
a
glint
of
steel
also
when
a
breeze
shifted
the
loose
fold
of
his
garments
that
seemed
to
say
that
his
was
not
all
peaceful
gear
just
behind
me
as
i
rode
with
wulfhere
and
wislac
to
right
and
left
came
my
six
men
big
powerful
housecarles
all
in
black
armour
and
carrying
red
and
black
shields
and
with
a
red
cross
on
their
fronts
and
the
squarest
of
these
six
he
who
seemed
to
be
their
leader
looked
up
at
me
when
i
turned
again
with
a
grin
that
i
seemed
to
know
so
i
took
closer
notice
of
him
and
lo
it
was
guthlac
the
reader
of
beowulf
and
the
other
five
were
his
brethren
small
wonder
that
i
had
not
recognized
the
holy
men
in
their
war
gear
so
little
looked
they
like
the
peaceful
brethren
who
had
walked
in
the
abbey
cloisters
with
them
was
my
collier
keeping
step
and
holding
himself
with
the
best
of
them
and
i
thought
that
they
would
be
seven
hardy
danes
who
should
overmatch
my
standard
guard
so
i
was
well
content
with
the
choice
for
me
now
of
that
march
to
brent
and
the
meeting
there
with
the
somerset
levy
there
is
no
need
to
tell
but
by
the
time
we
marched
from
thence
against
the
danes
there
were
five
hundred
men
of
dorset
and
near
nine
hundred
of
somerset
of
the
danes
some
judged
that
there
would
be
eight
hundred
or
more
but
if
that
was
so
they
were
tried
men
and
our
numbers
were
none
too
great
moreover
we
must
separate
so
as
to
drive
them
down
to
their
ships
for
they
were
spread
over
the
country
burning
and
destroying
on
every
side
we
lay
but
one
night
on
brent
while
the
leaders
held
counsel
and
even
as
we
sat
gathered
we
could
see
plainly
the
fires
the
danes
had
lit
of
burning
hamlet
and
homestead
far
and
wide
across
the
marshes
of
parret
and
the
end
of
that
council
was
that
eanulf
should
take
his
somerset
men
up
parret
valley
and
so
drive
down
the
danes
while
ealhstan
should
fall
on
them
by
bridgwater
as
they
came
down
and
so
scatter
them
therefore
would
the
somerset
levy
march
very
early
before
light
while
we
should
wait
till
the
next
night
unless
word
should
come
beforehand
so
we
went
to
sleep
and
as
i
slept
in
my
place
with
the
standard
flapping
above
me
and
my
comrades
on
either
side
and
behind
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
came
and
waked
me
and
when
i
sat
up
and
looked
thinking
it
was
a
messenger
from
the
bishop
i
saw
that
it
was
matelgar
now
this
time
i
had
no
fear
of
him
and
i
waited
for
him
to
speak
just
as
though
he
had
been
before
me
in
the
flesh
for
there
seemed
naught
uncanny
about
the
matter
to
me
and
yet
even
at
the
moment
that
seemed
strange
though
it
was
so
but
for
a
while
he
looked
not
at
me
but
out
over
the
low
lands
towards
parret
mouth
and
stert
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
though
it
were
broad
noonday
and
then
he
turned
back
to
me
and
spoke
heregar
i
promised
to
stand
by
you
again
when
the
time
came
now
i
bid
you
go
to
combwich
hill
there
to
wait
what
betides
so
if
you
will
do
the
bidding
of
the
dead
who
has
wronged
you
but
would
now
make
amends
shall
you
thank
me
for
this
hereafter
aye
and
not
you
only
then
out
over
parret
he
gazed
again
and
faded
from
beside
me
so
that
i
could
ask
him
nothing
then
knew
i
that
i
was
awake
and
that
this
had
been
no
dream
for
a
great
fear
came
on
me
for
a
little
knowing
what
i
had
seen
to
be
not
of
this
world
yet
all
around
me
my
comrades
slept
and
only
round
the
rim
of
the
trenched
hill
went
the
wakeful
sentries
too
far
for
speech
for
we
leaders
were
in
the
centre
of
the
camp
but
presently
i
began
to
think
less
of
the
vision
and
more
of
the
words
and
at
first
they
seemed
vain
for
combwich
hill
was
over
near
to
stert
nor
did
i
see
how
i
could
reach
the
place
without
cutting
through
the
danes
who
would
doubtless
leave
a
strong
guard
with
the
ships
and
were
also
in
and
about
bridgwater
seeing
that
the
river
must
be
crossed
then
as
i
turned
over
the
matter
not
doubting
but
that
a
message
so
given
was
sooth
and
by
no
means
lightly
to
be
disregarded
i
seemed
to
wake
to
a
resolve
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
whole
thing
what
if
i
could
win
there
under
cover
of
darkness
and
so
fall
on
the
danish
host
as
eanulf
drove
them
back
and
the
bishop
and
osric
chased
them
to
the
ships
that
seemed
possible
if
only
i
could
cross
parret
with
men
enough
and
unseen
i
would
ask
wulfhere
and
wislac
when
morning
came
and
so
if
they
could
help
lay
the
matter
before
the
bishop
himself
so
thinking
i
fell
asleep
again
peacefully
enough
nor
dreamt
i
aught
with
morning
light
that
vision
and
the
bidding
to
combwich
and
what
i
had
thought
thereon
seemed
yet
stronger
very
early
the
somerset
men
went
with
eanulf
and
we
of
the
bishop
levy
only
remained
on
brent
after
the
morning
meal
then
as
we
three
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
looked
out
where
matelgar
had
looked
i
told
my
two
friends
of
his
coming
and
of
his
words
three
things
there
are
said
wislac
that
hinder
this
business
namely
want
of
wings
uncertainty
of
darkness
and
ignorance
of
the
time
when
the
danes
shall
come
there
are
also
three
things
that
make
for
it
brother
said
wulfhere
namely
that
men
can
swim
that
there
is
no
moon
and
that
the
danes
are
careless
in
their
watch
of
the
waste
they
leave
behind
them
think
you
that
the
hill
will
be
unguarded
asked
i
glad
that
wulfhere
did
not
put
away
the
plan
at
once
why
should
they
guard
it
there
are
danes
at
the
ships
though
few
i
expect
for
we
have
been
well
beaten
and
more
in
plenty
from
parret
to
quantocks
and
no
saxon
left
between
the
two
forces
why
not
burn
the
ships
then
asked
wislac
doubtless
that
could
we
once
over
parret
answered
wulfhere
but
what
then
away
go
the
danes
through
somerset
burning
and
plundering
even
to
cornwall
and
there
bide
till
ships
come
and
then
can
be
gone
in
safety
that
is
not
what
we
need
we
have
to
trap
them
and
beat
them
here
so
then
wulfhere
i
said
think
you
that
the
plan
is
good
aye
he
answered
good
enough
but
not
easy
moreover
i
doubt
if
the
bishop
would
let
his
standard
bearer
part
from
him
that
was
likely
enough
to
stop
all
the
plan
but
yet
i
would
lay
it
before
ealhstan
for
it
seemed
to
us
that
such
a
message
might
by
no
means
go
untold
at
least
so
we
sought
him
and
asked
for
speech
with
him
and
at
that
he
laughed
saying
that
surely
his
council
had
the
best
right
to
that
osric
was
with
him
and
the
bishop
told
him
how
that
we
three
had
been
his
first
advisers
in
this
matter
then
we
sat
down
and
i
told
ealhstan
all
asking
nothing
when
i
had
ended
osric
looked
at
me
and
said
that
the
plan
was
venturesome
but
no
doubt
possible
to
be
carried
out
and
if
so
by
none
better
than
myself
who
knew
every
inch
of
that
country
then
thinking
over
it
as
it
were
he
added
that
the
woods
beyond
matelgar
hall
would
shelter
any
force
that
must
needs
seek
cover
so
that
even
were
combwich
hill
unsafe
there
was
yet
a
refuge
whence
attack
could
again
be
made
then
ealhstan
who
had
listened
quietly
said
that
such
messages
were
rare
but
all
the
less
to
be
despised
therefore
would
he
think
thereof
more
fully
what
he
asked
is
the
main
difficulty
i
said
that
the
crossing
of
parret
was
like
to
be
hard
in
any
case
but
at
night
and
unobserved
yet
more
so
but
that
could
we
reach
the
farther
bank
i
could
find
places
where
we
might
lie
in
wait
for
a
day
if
need
were
with
many
men
thereupon
the
bishop
took
that
great
book
of
caesar
wars
and
looked
into
it
but
he
seemed
long
in
finding
aught
to
meet
that
case
while
we
talked
of
one
thing
or
another
concerning
it
among
ourselves
at
last
he
shut
the
book
and
said
very
gravely
i
would
that
i
could
swim
i
also
father
said
wislac
and
why
i
can
not
save
for
sheer
cowardice
i
know
not
having
been
brought
up
on
thames
side
and
never
daring
to
go
out
of
depth
at
that
we
were
fain
to
laugh
so
dismally
did
the
mercian
blame
himself
but
the
bishop
said
that
if
i
went
needs
must
that
he
came
also
but
he
did
not
dissuade
me
in
any
way
wulfhere
the
counsellor
he
said
then
have
you
no
plan
to
cross
the
river
answered
the
veteran
aye
many
if
they
may
be
managed
rafts
for
those
who
can
not
swim
surely
now
i
bethought
me
of
the
many
boats
that
ever
lay
in
the
creek
under
combwich
and
wondered
if
any
were
yet
whole
for
if
they
were
surely
one
might
swim
over
and
bring
one
back
and
that
i
said
then
of
a
sudden
the
bishop
rose
up
and
seemed
to
have
come
to
a
decision
saying
see
here
thanes
ever
as
we
march
to
bridgwater
we
draw
nearer
parret
now
by
this
evening
we
shall
be
close
over
against
this
place
combwich
so
that
one
may
go
thither
and
spy
what
there
is
to
be
done
and
come
back
in
good
time
and
tell
us
if
crossing
may
be
made
by
raft
or
boat
let
this
rest
till
then
but
if
it
may
be
so
then
i
and
heregar
and
his
following
and
two
hundred
men
will
surely
cross
and
wait
for
what
may
betide
for
i
think
this
plan
is
good
so
he
would
say
no
more
of
it
then
and
presently
all
his
men
were
mustered
and
we
marched
from
brent
slowly
along
the
way
to
bridgwater
chapter
xiv
elgah
the
fisher
now
men
have
said
that
this
plan
of
mine
needed
no
ghost
to
set
it
forth
but
is
such
that
would
enter
the
mind
of
any
good
leader
that
might
be
so
had
there
been
one
there
who
knew
the
country
as
i
knew
it
but
there
was
not
and
i
was
no
general
as
was
eanulf
however
that
might
be
i
tell
what
happened
to
me
in
the
matter
and
sure
am
i
that
but
for
matelgar
bidding
i
had
never
thought
of
this
place
or
plan
but
once
ealhstan
had
heard
thereof
the
thought
of
it
seemed
ever
better
to
him
and
when
we
were
fairly
marching
along
the
level
towards
bridgwater
he
called
me
and
began
to
talk
of
that
business
of
spying
out
the
crossing
place
now
i
too
had
been
thinking
of
that
same
and
asked
him
to
let
me
go
at
once
taking
one
man
with
me
then
would
i
rejoin
him
as
best
i
might
and
close
to
the
place
where
i
might
fix
on
means
of
getting
over
now
there
seemed
little
danger
in
the
matter
for
our
spies
had
reported
no
danes
on
this
side
of
parret
for
they
kept
the
water
between
us
and
them
doubtless
knowing
that
osric
had
gone
to
brent
at
first
and
thinking
it
likely
that
another
levy
might
be
made
so
the
bishop
not
very
willingly
as
it
seemed
to
me
let
me
go
as
there
was
none
else
who
could
go
direct
to
the
point
as
i
could
without
loss
of
time
even
as
osric
told
him
then
i
gave
the
standard
into
wulfhere
hand
and
must
seek
one
to
go
with
me
first
i
thought
of
wislac
but
he
was
a
stranger
and
then
my
eyes
lit
on
my
collier
and
i
knew
that
i
need
go
no
further
so
i
called
him
and
taking
him
aside
while
the
men
streamed
past
us
looking
at
my
silver
arms
and
speaking
thereof
to
one
another
told
him
what
we
had
to
do
whereat
his
eyes
sparkled
and
he
said
that
it
was
good
hearing
but
master
he
went
on
take
off
those
bright
arms
of
yours
and
let
us
go
as
marshmen
then
will
be
no
suspicion
if
the
danes
see
us
from
across
the
water
that
was
wise
counsel
and
we
left
our
arms
in
a
baggage
wagon
borrowing
frocks
from
the
churls
who
followed
us
and
only
keeping
our
seaxes
in
our
belts
then
dudda
found
a
horse
that
was
led
with
the
wagons
and
i
bade
the
man
whose
it
was
lend
it
to
him
promising
good
hire
for
its
use
and
so
we
two
rode
off
together
across
the
marshland
away
by
burnham
while
the
levy
held
on
steadily
by
the
main
road
then
was
i
glad
that
i
had
brought
the
collier
for
the
marsh
was
treacherous
and
hard
to
pass
in
places
but
he
knew
the
firm
ground
as
it
were
by
nature
and
we
went
on
quickly
enough
now
and
then
we
passed
huts
but
they
were
empty
for
away
across
the
wide
river
mouth
at
burnham
though
we
rode
not
into
that
village
we
could
see
the
six
long
black
ships
as
they
lay
at
stert
and
the
smoke
of
the
fires
their
guard
had
made
on
shore
but
on
this
side
of
the
river
they
had
been
for
burnham
was
but
a
heap
of
ashes
they
had
crossed
in
their
small
boats
doubtless
and
found
the
place
empty
then
at
last
we
came
to
a
hut
some
two
miles
off
in
the
marshes
from
combwich
and
in
that
we
left
our
horses
giving
them
hay
from
the
little
rick
that
stood
thereby
to
that
poor
place
at
least
the
danes
had
not
come
for
the
remains
of
food
left
on
the
table
showed
that
the
owners
had
fled
hastily
but
in
panic
and
that
none
had
been
near
the
place
since
now
dudda
would
have
us
take
poles
and
a
net
we
found
left
on
our
shoulders
that
we
might
seem
fishers
daring
to
return
or
maybe
driven
by
hunger
to
our
work
for
we
must
go
unhidden
soon
where
the
marshland
lay
open
and
bare
down
to
the
river
the
alder
and
willow
holts
ceasing
when
their
roots
felt
the
salt
water
of
the
spring
tides
but
we
had
been
able
to
keep
under
their
cover
as
far
as
the
hut
so
we
went
towards
the
river
as
i
had
many
a
time
seen
the
fishers
go
in
the
quiet
days
that
were
past
and
we
said
little
but
kept
our
eyes
strained
both
up
and
down
the
river
for
sign
of
the
danes
but
all
we
saw
was
once
far
off
on
stert
the
flash
of
bright
arms
or
helm
and
there
we
knew
before
that
men
must
be
on
combwich
hill
was
no
smoke
wreath
of
the
outpost
fires
i
had
feared
nor
could
i
see
aught
moving
among
the
trees
then
at
last
we
stood
on
the
river
bank
and
looked
across
at
the
little
haven
all
the
huts
were
burnt
and
silent
there
were
many
crows
and
ravens
among
the
trees
above
where
they
had
stood
and
a
great
osprey
wheeled
over
our
heads
as
we
looked
no
men
here
said
my
comrade
else
would
not
yon
birds
be
so
quiet
but
i
could
see
no
boat
and
my
heart
sank
somewhat
for
nothing
was
there
on
this
bank
wherewith
to
make
the
raft
of
which
wulfhere
spake
then
said
i
let
us
swim
over
and
see
what
we
can
find
now
it
was
three
hours
after
noon
or
thereabouts
and
the
tide
was
running
out
very
swiftly
and
it
was
a
long
passage
over
nevertheless
we
agreed
to
try
it
and
so
going
higher
up
the
stream
we
cast
ourselves
in
and
swam
quartering
across
the
tide
a
long
and
heavy
swim
it
was
but
no
more
than
two
strong
men
could
well
manage
all
the
time
however
i
looked
to
see
some
dane
come
out
from
the
trees
and
spy
us
but
there
was
none
then
we
reached
the
other
bank
and
stood
to
gain
breath
for
now
we
were
in
the
enemy
country
and
tired
as
we
were
we
threw
ourselves
down
in
the
shelter
of
a
willow
tree
on
the
side
away
from
the
hill
and
village
in
a
moment
the
collier
touched
my
arm
and
pointed
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
stood
a
man
looking
down
towards
us
but
he
was
unarmed
as
well
as
i
could
see
and
moreover
his
figure
seemed
familiar
we
watched
him
closely
for
he
began
to
come
down
towards
us
and
as
he
came
nearer
i
knew
him
it
was
one
of
the
combwich
villeins
a
fisher
of
the
name
of
elgar
now
i
would
speak
with
him
for
he
could
tell
me
all
i
needed
yet
i
knew
not
if
he
had
made
friends
with
the
danes
being
here
and
seeming
careless
we
lost
sight
of
him
among
the
trees
and
the
birds
flew
up
croaking
from
them
marking
his
path
as
yet
towards
us
and
at
last
he
came
from
behind
a
hut
close
to
us
then
i
called
him
by
name
he
started
and
whipped
out
a
long
knife
and
in
a
moment
was
behind
the
hut
wall
again
so
i
knew
that
he
was
not
in
league
with
the
enemy
but
feared
them
therefore
i
rose
up
and
called
him
again
adding
that
i
was
heregar
and
needed
him
then
he
came
out
staring
at
me
with
his
knife
yet
ready
but
when
he
saw
that
it
was
really
myself
he
ran
to
meet
me
with
a
cry
of
joy
and
knelt
before
me
kissing
my
hands
and
weeping
so
that
it
was
a
while
before
i
could
ask
him
anything
very
starved
and
wretched
he
looked
and
i
judged
rightly
that
he
had
taken
to
the
woods
from
the
first
presently
he
was
quiet
enough
to
answer
my
questions
and
he
told
me
that
at
first
the
danes
had
had
a
strong
post
on
the
hill
above
us
but
that
growing
confident
they
had
left
it
these
two
days
but
there
were
many
passing
and
repassing
along
the
road
bringing
plunder
back
to
the
ships
he
had
watched
them
from
the
woods
he
said
also
he
told
me
that
even
now
mounted
men
had
ridden
past
swiftly
going
to
the
ships
and
from
that
i
guessed
that
eanulf
force
had
been
seen
at
least
and
tidings
sent
thereof
then
i
asked
him
if
any
boats
were
left
unburnt
and
at
that
a
cunning
look
came
into
his
thin
face
and
he
answered
aye
master
three
of
us
were
minded
to
save
ours
and
we
sank
them
with
stones
in
the
creek
before
we
fled
but
the
other
two
are
slain
and
i
only
am
left
to
recover
them
now
that
was
good
hearing
and
i
bade
the
men
show
me
where
they
lay
and
going
with
him
found
that
now
the
water
was
low
we
could
see
them
and
reach
them
easily
there
were
two
small
boats
that
might
hold
three
men
each
and
one
larger
then
i
told
elgar
how
i
needed
them
for
this
night
work
and
at
first
he
was
terrified
fearing
nothing
more
than
that
his
boats
should
be
lost
to
him
after
all
but
i
promised
him
full
amends
if
harm
came
to
them
and
that
in
the
name
of
osric
which
he
knew
well
and
with
that
he
was
satisfied
so
with
a
little
labour
we
got
the
two
small
boats
afloat
and
then
cast
about
where
to
hide
them
for
though
elgar
said
that
the
danes
came
not
nigh
the
place
it
was
likely
that
patrols
would
be
sent
out
after
the
alarm
of
eanulf
approach
and
might
come
on
them
at
last
elgar
said
that
there
was
a
creek
half
a
mile
or
less
up
the
river
and
on
the
far
side
where
they
might
lie
unseen
perhaps
and
that
would
suit
us
well
if
we
could
get
them
there
and
the
time
was
drawing
on
so
that
we
could
make
no
delay
then
out
of
a
hollow
tree
elgar
drew
oars
for
both
boats
and
we
got
them
out
into
the
river
and
dudda
rowing
one
and
elgar
the
other
in
which
i
sat
we
went
to
the
place
where
they
should
be
keeping
under
the
bank
next
the
danes
and
it
was
well
for
us
that
the
tide
was
so
low
for
else
we
should
surely
have
been
spied
yet
we
got
them
into
the
creek
elgar
making
them
fast
so
that
they
would
rise
as
the
water
rose
then
he
said
he
would
swim
back
and
if
he
could
manage
it
would
raise
the
large
boat
and
bring
that
also
so
without
climbing
out
from
under
the
high
banks
of
the
creek
he
splashed
out
into
the
tideway
and
started
back
now
dudda
and
i
must
make
our
way
along
to
the
horses
and
so
we
began
to
get
out
of
the
creek
which
was
very
deep
at
this
low
ebb
of
the
water
below
the
level
of
the
meadows
dudda
was
up
the
bank
first
and
looked
towards
combwich
then
he
dropped
back
suddenly
and
bade
me
creep
up
warily
and
look
also
through
the
grass
so
i
did
and
then
knew
how
near
an
escape
we
had
had
for
there
was
a
party
of
danes
idlers
as
it
seemed
among
the
burnt
huts
turning
over
the
ashes
with
their
spears
and
throwing
stones
into
the
water
then
i
saw
elgar
head
halfway
across
the
river
and
knew
he
could
not
see
the
danes
over
the
high
bank
he
was
swimming
straight
for
them
and
unless
he
caught
sight
of
one
who
stood
nearest
surely
he
was
lost
it
was
all
that
i
could
do
to
keep
myself
from
crying
out
to
him
but
that
would
have
betrayed
us
also
and
with
us
the
hope
of
our
ambush
so
we
must
set
our
teeth
and
watch
him
go
then
a
dane
came
to
the
edge
of
the
high
bank
and
saw
him
and
at
the
same
moment
was
himself
seen
the
dane
shouted
and
elgar
stopped
paddling
with
his
hands
and
keeping
his
head
above
water
now
we
looked
to
see
him
swim
back
to
this
bank
and
began
to
wonder
if
the
enemy
would
follow
him
and
so
find
us
and
for
one
moment
i
believe
he
meant
to
do
so
and
then
brave
man
as
he
was
gave
himself
away
to
save
us
for
he
stretched
himself
out
once
more
and
began
to
swim
leisurely
downstream
never
looking
at
the
danes
again
for
now
half
a
dozen
were
there
and
watching
him
calling
too
that
he
should
come
ashore
as
one
might
guess
but
elgar
paid
no
heed
to
them
and
swam
on
they
began
to
throw
stones
and
one
cast
a
spear
at
him
but
that
fell
short
then
the
bank
hid
him
from
us
but
we
saw
a
dane
fixing
arrow
to
bowstring
and
saw
him
shoot
but
he
missed
surely
for
he
took
another
arrow
and
ran
on
down
the
bank
then
dudda
pulled
me
by
the
arm
and
motioned
me
to
follow
him
and
i
saw
no
more
now
the
creek
wherein
we
were
ran
inland
for
a
quarter
mile
that
we
could
see
ever
bending
round
so
that
our
boats
were
hidden
from
the
side
where
the
danes
were
up
that
creek
we
ran
or
rather
paddled
therefore
knee
deep
in
mud
but
quite
unseen
by
any
but
the
great
erne
that
fled
over
us
crying
hard
work
it
was
but
before
the
creek
ended
we
had
covered
half
a
mile
away
from
danger
and
looking
back
through
the
grass
along
the
bank
could
see
the
danes
no
longer
yet
we
had
no
surety
that
they
could
not
see
us
and
therefore
crawled
yet
among
grass
and
thistles
along
such
hollows
as
we
could
find
at
last
we
dared
stand
up
and
still
we
could
see
no
danes
as
we
looked
back
and
then
we
grew
bolder
and
walked
leisurely
as
fishers
might
not
daring
to
run
across
to
that
hut
where
the
horses
were
and
reaching
that
our
adventure
was
ended
for
we
were
safe
and
believed
ourselves
unnoticed
if
not
unseen
for
there
was
no
reason
why
the
danes
should
think
aught
of
two
thralls
as
we
seemed
crossing
the
marsh
a
mile
away
and
quietly
even
if
they
spied
us
after
we
reached
our
horses
there
is
nothing
to
tell
of
our
ride
back
to
the
bishop
we
overtook
him
before
dark
where
his
men
were
halted
two
miles
from
bridgwater
on
the
road
waiting
for
word
from
eanulf
much
praise
gave
he
to
me
and
the
collier
for
what
we
had
done
as
also
did
osric
and
we
getting
our
arms
again
went
back
to
our
own
places
well
content
eager
also
was
i
to
tell
wulfhere
and
wislac
of
all
that
had
befallen
and
how
i
had
boats
for
the
crossing
and
when
they
heard
how
elgar
the
fisher
had
swam
on
rather
than
draw
attention
to
the
place
where
we
two
lay
wulfhere
nodded
and
said
that
was
well
done
and
wislac
said
truly
i
would
i
could
do
the
like
of
that
much
courage
is
there
in
the
man
who
will
face
a
host
with
comrades
beside
him
against
odds
but
more
is
there
in
the
man
who
will
go
alone
to
certain
death
because
thereby
he
will
save
others
even
as
we
talked
there
came
riding
a
man
from
bridgwater
going
fast
yet
in
no
great
hurry
as
it
seemed
he
rode
up
to
us
for
there
was
the
standard
and
asked
for
the
bishop
having
word
from
eanulf
for
him
and
guthlac
told
ealhstan
who
came
up
to
speak
to
him
bidding
us
bide
and
listen
what
the
man
had
to
tell
was
this
that
the
danes
had
in
some
way
had
word
of
the
march
of
our
levies
and
had
straightway
gathered
together
or
were
yet
gathering
from
their
raidings
here
and
there
on
the
steep
hill
above
bridgwater
having
passed
through
the
town
or
such
as
was
left
thereof
after
many
burnings
and
it
was
eanulf
plan
to
attack
them
there
with
the
first
light
if
the
bishop
would
join
him
with
his
levy
then
the
bishop
asked
if
there
had
been
any
fighting
and
the
man
said
that
there
had
been
some
between
the
van
of
our
force
and
the
rear
of
the
danish
host
but
that
neither
side
had
lost
many
men
nor
had
there
been
any
advantage
gained
except
to
clear
the
town
of
the
heathen
having
heard
that
ealhstan
bade
me
go
aside
with
him
and
called
osric
and
some
more
of
the
thanes
to
hold
a
council
and
in
the
end
it
was
decided
that
osric
should
take
on
the
bulk
of
the
levy
to
join
the
ealdorman
while
the
bishop
and
i
and
two
hundred
of
the
men
should
try
that
crossing
at
combwich
for
thus
said
ealhstan
we
can
fall
on
the
danes
from
behind
if
they
stand
or
in
flank
if
they
retreat
and
except
that
the
bishop
would
go
with
me
this
pleased
them
well
enough
but
they
tried
to
dissuade
him
from
leaving
the
levy
but
he
laughed
and
said
that
indeed
he
was
only
going
on
before
it
for
to
reach
him
they
would
have
to
go
clear
through
the
danes
where
they
stood
thickest
and
when
they
reached
the
standard
victory
would
be
theirs
then
they
cried
that
they
would
surely
not
fail
to
reach
him
and
so
the
matter
was
settled
and
the
thanes
told
this
to
their
men
who
shouted
and
cheered
so
that
this
seemed
to
be
a
good
plan
after
all
now
the
bishop
rode
among
the
men
calling
out
those
whom
he
knew
well
and
bidding
the
thanes
give
him
their
best
or
if
they
had
no
best
such
as
could
swim
and
very
shortly
we
had
full
two
hundred
men
ranged
on
one
side
of
the
road
waiting
with
us
while
the
rest
went
off
towards
bridgwater
the
bishop
blessing
them
ere
they
started
and
as
they
went
they
shouted
that
we
should
meet
again
across
the
ranks
of
danes
when
they
were
gone
the
bishop
bade
us
rest
and
while
we
lay
along
the
roadside
he
went
up
and
down
sorting
out
men
who
could
swim
well
and
there
were
more
than
half
who
could
do
so
and
more
yet
who
said
they
were
swimmers
though
poor
at
it
then
he
told
me
his
plan
how
that
the
men
who
could
not
swim
must
go
over
first
in
the
boats
and
then
the
arms
of
the
rest
should
be
ferried
over
while
they
swam
and
so
little
time
would
be
lost
but
all
must
be
done
in
silence
and
without
lights
so
we
ate
and
slept
a
little
and
then
when
it
grew
dark
started
off
across
the
meadows
and
there
the
collier
guided
us
well
having
taken
note
of
all
the
ground
we
had
crossed
in
the
morning
as
a
marshman
can
it
was
dark
and
a
white
creeping
mist
was
over
the
open
land
when
we
reached
it
but
over
the
mists
to
our
left
we
could
see
the
twinkle
of
danish
watchfires
where
they
kept
the
height
over
bridgwater
and
again
to
the
right
we
could
see
lights
of
fires
at
stert
where
the
ships
lay
but
at
combwich
were
no
lights
at
all
and
that
was
well
presently
we
reached
a
winding
stretch
of
deep
water
and
though
it
was
far
different
when
i
saw
it
last
i
knew
it
was
the
creek
in
which
our
boats
lay
and
up
which
dudda
and
i
had
fled
full
now
with
the
rising
tide
we
held
on
down
its
course
until
dudda
told
me
in
a
low
voice
that
we
were
but
a
bowshot
from
the
boats
and
that
now
it
were
well
for
the
men
to
lie
down
that
they
might
be
less
easily
noticed
so
the
word
was
passed
in
a
whisper
down
the
line
and
immediately
it
seemed
as
if
the
force
had
vanished
as
the
white
mist
crept
over
where
they
had
stood
now
dudda
and
i
went
down
to
the
boats
and
there
found
not
the
two
we
had
left
only
but
a
third
and
larger
one
beside
them
and
at
first
this
frightened
us
and
we
stood
looking
at
them
almost
expecting
armed
men
to
rise
from
the
dark
hollows
of
the
boats
and
fall
on
us
then
i
would
see
if
such
were
there
and
stepped
softly
into
the
nearest
it
was
empty
and
so
was
the
next
and
these
were
our
two
dudda
came
after
me
and
he
hissed
to
me
under
his
breath
the
oars
had
been
muffled
with
sacking
now
none
but
a
friend
would
have
done
this
unless
it
was
a
most
crafty
trap
to
take
us
withal
and
yet
to
leave
the
boats
as
they
were
had
been
surer
than
to
meddle
with
them
if
such
was
meant
now
dudda
perplexed
as
i
though
in
my
heart
was
a
thought
that
after
all
elgar
had
escaped
stepped
into
the
large
boat
and
there
he
started
back
so
suddenly
as
almost
to
overturn
it
smothering
a
cry
then
was
silence
for
a
moment
while
i
for
my
part
drew
my
dagger
then
i
saw
him
stoop
down
and
again
he
hissed
to
me
the
boats
were
afloat
and
i
drew
that
i
was
in
up
to
the
big
boat
oh
master
said
dudda
whispering
surely
this
is
elgar
the
fisher
and
i
peering
into
the
dark
bottom
of
the
boat
could
see
a
dark
still
form
lying
doubled
over
a
thwart
that
seemed
to
me
to
bear
likeness
to
him
is
he
dead
i
asked
aye
master
but
not
long
answered
the
collier
feeling
about
ah
he
said
with
a
sort
of
groan
here
is
a
broken
arrow
in
his
shoulder
and
in
his
hand
somewhat
to
muffle
the
oars
withal
well
done
brave
elgar
well
done
then
i
climbed
softly
over
the
gunwale
and
so
it
was
wounded
to
death
as
he
had
been
by
the
arrow
shot
he
had
yet
in
some
way
contrived
to
get
this
boat
here
and
afterwards
to
use
his
last
strength
in
muffling
the
oars
and
so
died
spent
before
he
could
end
his
task
and
for
him
i
was
not
ashamed
of
weeping
thinking
there
in
the
darkness
as
we
bore
him
hastily
to
the
bank
and
laid
him
beyond
the
reach
of
hurrying
feet
to
come
of
how
he
must
have
been
shot
and
so
at
once
feigning
death
have
floated
or
perhaps
stranded
on
the
mud
till
the
danes
were
gone
and
then
returned
in
spite
of
pain
and
growing
weakness
to
do
what
he
had
set
himself
for
the
sake
of
his
country
but
there
was
no
time
for
more
than
thought
and
now
that
we
knew
the
boats
safe
i
went
back
to
the
bishop
and
told
him
that
all
was
ready
and
he
ever
thoughtful
had
told
off
skilful
men
to
row
the
boats
over
and
though
now
we
must
have
enough
for
three
he
had
found
six
or
eight
oarsmen
and
there
was
no
delay
though
they
must
work
with
less
change
and
the
tide
was
still
making
so
that
the
pull
to
combwich
creek
would
be
hard
then
ten
men
went
softly
to
the
boats
and
at
the
last
i
bade
them
pull
across
to
where
they
might
not
making
for
the
creek
and
in
a
minute
or
two
they
were
gone
into
the
mist
and
darkness
then
came
crawling
to
the
river
bank
some
six
or
eight
men
strong
swimmers
and
would
have
tried
to
cross
but
i
bade
them
wait
till
the
next
boatloads
went
over
so
that
they
might
cross
beside
them
and
cling
to
the
gunwale
if
the
stream
was
too
strong
however
though
most
knew
that
was
good
counsel
two
must
needs
try
it
and
one
got
across
nearly
spent
and
the
other
came
back
clinging
to
the
first
boat
to
return
else
had
he
been
drowned
and
it
was
a
lucky
chance
that
the
boat
met
him
now
the
man
who
rowed
this
first
boat
reported
that
there
was
silence
and
no
sign
of
danes
on
the
other
side
and
so
also
did
the
rest
as
they
came
after
that
the
crossing
went
on
quickly
men
swimming
beside
the
boats
and
in
an
hour
and
a
half
all
were
over
when
we
found
that
all
was
safe
the
bishop
bade
me
cross
with
the
standard
and
so
keep
the
men
together
he
himself
came
last
of
all
when
wulfhere
came
swimming
beside
the
boat
in
which
sat
wislac
he
took
three
men
and
went
quietly
to
combwich
which
was
nearly
half
a
mile
from
where
we
landed
and
was
back
presently
reporting
all
quiet
then
dudda
and
the
other
rowers
sank
the
boats
lest
they
should
be
seen
by
chance
and
so
betray
us
and
our
crossing
now
we
went
i
leading
through
this
place
i
knew
so
well
round
the
head
of
the
little
creek
and
so
on
up
the
hill
walking
in
single
file
almost
and
very
silently
and
when
we
topped
the
hill
there
before
us
among
the
tree
trunks
glowed
a
little
fire
and
round
that
sat
six
danes
wrapped
in
their
red
cloaks
and
as
i
could
see
all
or
most
of
them
asleep
at
that
i
stopped
and
the
line
behind
me
stopped
also
making
a
clatter
of
arms
as
men
ran
against
one
another
in
the
dark
one
of
the
danes
stirred
at
that
and
looked
up
and
round
but
he
could
see
nothing
and
so
folded
himself
up
again
then
i
saw
that
they
had
an
ale
cask
now
i
knew
that
this
post
must
be
surrounded
and
taken
and
whispered
to
wulfhere
who
was
next
me
what
to
do
and
he
answered
that
he
would
manage
it
bidding
me
stand
still
then
he
went
down
the
line
whispering
in
each
man
ear
till
he
had
told
off
twenty
men
and
them
he
sent
off
right
and
left
into
the
darkness
and
i
was
left
with
wislac
standing
alone
watching
the
danes
i
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
them
till
they
seemed
to
waver
and
grow
dim
so
intently
did
i
watch
them
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
the
sound
of
a
raven
croak
and
into
the
firelight
and
on
those
careless
watchers
leapt
wulfhere
and
his
men
from
all
around
there
was
one
choked
cry
and
that
was
all
and
wulfhere
beckoned
to
me
i
advanced
and
the
line
closed
up
and
followed
now
we
stood
on
combwich
hill
and
all
was
well
so
far
ealhstan
came
up
to
me
unknowing
of
what
had
caused
the
halt
being
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
when
he
knew
said
it
was
well
done
and
that
now
we
might
rest
safely
for
a
time
so
we
bade
the
men
sit
down
and
those
who
were
wet
made
up
the
fire
afresh
for
there
was
no
need
to
put
it
out
but
rather
reason
for
allowing
the
danes
to
see
it
burning
as
if
in
safety
when
we
three
sat
by
the
bishop
wislac
asked
what
we
were
to
wait
for
and
indeed
that
must
be
the
next
thought
then
said
the
bishop
that
after
a
while
he
would
take
the
force
to
the
woods
that
overhung
the
roadway
and
so
wait
for
the
danes
as
eanulf
and
osric
drove
them
back
but
that
it
was
not
more
than
midnight
yet
then
came
a
little
silence
and
in
that
i
seemed
to
hear
the
sound
of
footsteps
coming
up
the
hill
from
combwich
and
bade
the
others
listen
and
at
the
same
time
some
of
the
men
heard
the
sound
and
started
up
to
see
who
came
but
they
were
the
steps
of
one
man
only
walking
carelessly
into
the
light
of
the
fire
stepped
one
at
the
sight
of
whom
the
men
stared
though
wislac
laughed
quietly
it
was
that
young
thane
who
had
wanted
to
fight
my
friend
wislac
on
the
day
of
the
council
he
was
very
wet
and
tired
throwing
himself
down
beside
us
when
he
saw
where
we
sat
ealhstan
asked
him
who
bade
him
come
and
how
he
had
followed
us
nearly
had
i
forgotten
a
dispute
i
have
with
wislac
the
thane
here
wherefore
i
asked
no
man
leave
but
followed
you
just
too
late
for
the
crossing
so
needs
must
swim
and
here
am
i
to
see
that
wislac
counts
fairly
and
that
he
may
have
the
same
surety
of
me
whereat
we
were
obliged
to
laugh
and
most
of
all
the
bishop
because
he
would
fain
have
been
angry
and
could
not
then
the
thane
whose
name
was
aldhelm
asked
who
was
the
slain
man
over
whose
body
he
had
fallen
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
so
i
told
them
of
elgar
the
fisher
and
of
his
brave
deeds
and
they
were
silent
thinking
of
what
his
worth
was
too
great
indeed
for
praise
only
the
bishop
said
he
should
surely
have
a
mound
raised
over
him
as
over
a
warrior
charging
us
three
or
whichever
lived
after
this
fight
to
see
to
that
now
we
slept
a
little
posting
sentries
at
many
points
and
giving
those
next
the
danes
on
either
side
the
red
cloaks
of
the
picket
we
had
slain
lest
daylight
should
betray
them
it
was
in
all
our
minds
that
at
daybreak
our
men
would
attack
from
bridgwater
driving
the
danes
back
on
us
and
so
we
should
fall
on
them
while
they
were
retreating
and
complete
the
victory
so
we
had
men
on
the
hill
overlooking
the
road
to
bridgwater
through
cannington
that
they
might
give
us
the
first
warning
therefore
i
slept
quietly
and
all
with
me
and
as
i
slept
i
dreamed
it
seemed
that
i
was
standing
alone
on
brent
hill
and
from
that
i
could
look
all
over
the
land
of
somerset
as
an
eagle
might
look
but
being
close
to
everything
that
i
would
see
and
i
saw
all
that
i
had
done
since
i
stood
there
as
a
prisoner
watching
myself
curiously
in
all
that
i
did
and
yet
knowing
all
the
thoughts
that
drove
me
to
deed
after
deed
and
so
through
the
mirk
wood
till
i
turned
and
slew
and
armed
myself
and
tormented
my
prisoner
then
to
the
collier
hut
and
my
talking
with
the
child
then
on
till
i
saw
the
lights
of
the
viking
ships
and
so
thereafter
bore
the
war
arrow
everything
till
at
last
i
saw
myself
sleeping
under
the
trees
on
the
top
of
this
hill
of
combwich
and
there
i
thought
my
dream
would
surely
end
but
it
did
not
for
now
out
of
the
shadows
came
matelgar
and
stood
beside
me
and
waked
me
and
he
told
me
that
when
the
tide
was
out
i
must
be
up
and
doing
and
so
he
passed
and
the
old
crone
gundred
came
out
of
the
shadows
and
sat
on
her
bundle
of
sticks
and
looked
at
me
and
she
too
bade
me
be
up
and
doing
when
the
tide
was
low
and
she
looked
at
the
standard
that
lay
beside
me
and
said
aye
a
standard
but
not
yet
the
dragon
of
wessex
and
so
she
too
faded
away
and
then
came
alswythe
and
as
she
came
it
seemed
as
i
looked
that
i
stretched
my
arms
to
her
but
she
smiled
and
said
love
when
the
tide
is
out
i
shall
be
praying
in
the
abbey
for
you
and
your
men
and
then
from
beside
her
came
turkil
the
little
child
smiling
also
but
hanging
to
alswythe
dress
as
he
said
warrior
when
the
water
falls
low
my
father
will
call
me
from
the
hill
and
i
will
pray
for
you
and
for
him
so
these
two
were
gone
and
at
that
i
seemed
to
see
our
men
lie
in
bridgwater
and
there
was
turkil
father
the
franklin
sleeping
with
the
rest
but
up
and
down
among
them
went
eanulf
the
ealdorman
watching
ever
then
fled
i
as
it
were
to
that
hill
where
lay
the
danes
and
on
the
road
thither
i
saw
osric
and
twenty
men
looking
up
at
the
fires
that
burnt
where
the
enemy
lay
and
then
i
looked
on
those
fires
and
there
were
no
men
round
them
one
shook
me
by
the
shoulder
and
my
dream
went
it
was
dudda
and
his
eyes
were
bright
in
the
firelight
and
over
brent
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
were
broadening
and
the
mists
were
gone
master
master
he
said
come
with
me
to
the
roadway
something
is
afoot
then
i
woke
wulfhere
asking
him
to
wait
for
me
guarding
the
standard
and
followed
my
man
swiftly
to
the
place
where
the
road
cuts
the
hill
and
there
was
a
knot
of
the
men
standing
and
listening
i
listened
also
and
far
off
towards
cannington
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
tread
of
many
feet
for
the
morning
was
still
and
quiet
and
the
men
said
that
this
was
growing
nearer
then
knew
i
that
the
danes
were
falling
back
to
the
ships
without
risking
battle
and
my
dream
came
back
to
me
with
its
vision
of
unguarded
watch
fires
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
surely
unless
we
could
stay
them
they
would
depart
with
the
tide
as
it
fell
how
is
the
tide
asked
i
of
the
men
round
me
failing
now
said
one
who
knew
but
not
fast
then
i
remembered
things
i
had
hardly
noted
in
years
gone
by
how
the
tide
hung
around
stert
point
as
though
severn
and
parret
warred
for
a
while
before
the
mighty
severn
ebb
sucked
parret
dry
and
how
the
ebb
at
last
came
swift
and
sudden
when
the
tide
is
low
said
they
whom
i
had
seen
in
my
dream
and
in
a
moment
i
recalled
the
first
fight
and
the
words
of
gundred
and
i
knew
that
we
had
the
danes
in
a
trap
they
were
marching
now
in
time
to
gain
their
ships
and
be
off
as
the
last
man
stepped
on
board
with
the
full
draft
of
the
ebb
to
set
them
out
to
sea
beyond
lundy
isle
into
open
water
nor
had
they
left
their
post
till
the
last
moment
lest
our
levy
should
be
on
their
heels
or
else
some
more
distant
marauding
party
had
not
come
in
till
late
i
went
back
to
wulfhere
and
told
him
this
and
in
it
all
he
agreed
and
as
we
whispered
together
ealhstan
sat
up
asking
quickly
who
spoke
to
me
and
looking
round
for
one
near
him
as
it
seemed
none
spoke
father
said
i
or
none
but
wulfhere
to
me
whispering
what
said
wulfhere
that
the
tide
was
failing
i
answered
the
bishop
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
he
said
i
heard
a
voice
plainly
that
cried
to
me
for
the
lord
has
delivered
these
heathen
into
your
hands
we
heard
no
such
voice
father
i
said
but
i
think
it
spoke
true
now
the
light
was
broadening
making
all
things
cold
and
gray
as
it
came
and
quickly
i
told
ealhstan
what
i
had
heard
and
what
both
i
and
wulfhere
thought
of
the
matter
can
we
let
them
pass
us
and
so
fall
on
them
as
they
gain
the
level
land
of
stert
asked
ealhstan
saying
nothing
more
that
can
we
i
answered
they
will
keep
to
the
road
and
we
can
draw
back
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
so
taking
them
in
flank
as
they
leave
it
for
the
hills
bend
round
a
little
beyond
the
place
where
the
road
falls
into
the
level
below
matelgar
hall
so
be
it
said
the
bishop
go
you
wulfhere
and
see
how
near
the
host
is
and
come
back
quickly
when
he
was
gone
the
bishop
bade
me
wake
the
men
and
at
first
i
was
for
going
round
but
by
this
thane
wislac
had
waked
and
had
been
listening
to
us
and
he
said
that
if
i
would
let
him
wake
the
men
he
could
do
it
without
alarm
or
undue
noise
only
i
must
raise
the
standard
and
bid
them
be
silent
at
that
the
bishop
smiled
and
nodded
and
i
raised
the
standard
and
waited
then
wislac
stood
up
and
crowed
like
a
cock
and
instantly
the
men
began
to
turn
and
sit
up
and
as
their
eyes
lit
on
the
standard
raised
in
their
midst
became
broad
awake
each
man
rousing
the
next
sleeper
if
one
lay
near
him
and
there
was
the
bishop
finger
on
lip
and
they
were
silent
verily
i
thought
on
the
hard
chapel
stones
muttered
guthlac
the
lay
brother
behind
me
it
is
the
war
chime
not
the
matin
bell
you
shall
hear
this
morning
said
one
of
his
brethren
that
is
better
mea
culpa
said
guthlac
clapping
his
hand
on
his
mouth
to
stop
his
own
warlike
ejaculation
then
came
wulfhere
back
swiftly
barely
a
mile
were
they
from
the
hill
he
said
and
coming
on
quickly
in
loose
order
moreover
a
horseman
had
passed
riding
hard
to
the
ships
doubtless
to
bid
them
be
ready
but
that
would
take
little
time
for
these
vikings
are
ever
ready
for
flight
keeping
their
ships
prepared
from
day
to
day
chapter
xv
the
great
fight
at
parret
mouth
now
very
silently
we
drew
off
from
that
place
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
which
looks
across
the
road
to
stert
and
there
the
bishop
drew
us
up
in
line
four
deep
and
told
the
men
what
we
must
do
bidding
them
be
silent
till
we
charged
though
that
could
not
prevent
a
hum
of
stern
approval
going
down
the
line
one
man
the
bishop
called
out
by
name
and
when
he
stood
before
him
bade
him
as
a
swift
runner
hasten
back
to
eanulf
or
osric
and
bid
them
on
here
with
all
speed
and
when
the
man
face
fell
the
bishop
bade
him
cheer
up
and
go
for
the
swifter
he
went
the
sooner
would
he
be
back
at
the
sword
play
whereat
the
man
bowed
and
leaving
his
mail
at
a
tree
foot
started
at
a
steady
run
over
the
ground
we
had
covered
already
and
was
lost
in
the
trees
then
we
waited
and
the
light
grew
stronger
every
moment
as
we
lay
in
line
among
the
bushes
we
could
see
without
much
fear
of
being
ourselves
seen
and
by
and
by
we
could
make
out
the
ships
they
had
their
masts
raised
and
the
sails
were
plain
to
be
seen
ready
for
hoisting
the
men
were
busy
about
their
decks
and
on
shore
as
well
while
the
vessels
were
yet
close
up
to
the
land
they
must
haul
off
soon
little
by
little
or
they
would
be
aground
as
doubtless
they
had
been
with
every
tide
till
this
for
rocks
are
none
only
soft
mud
on
which
a
ship
may
lie
safely
but
through
which
no
man
may
go
save
on
such
a
horse
as
the
fishers
use
to
reach
their
nets
withal
contrivances
of
flat
boards
which
sink
not
the
wait
seemed
long
but
at
last
we
heard
the
hum
of
voices
and
the
tramp
of
feet
and
our
hearts
beat
fast
and
thick
for
the
time
was
coming
over
the
hill
and
down
it
they
streamed
in
a
long
loose
line
laughing
and
shouting
as
the
ships
came
in
sight
a
long
breath
came
from
us
and
there
was
a
little
stir
among
the
men
but
the
time
was
not
yet
and
we
crouched
low
waiting
to
make
our
spring
then
ran
up
a
long
red
forked
flag
with
a
black
raven
on
it
from
the
largest
ship
and
that
seemed
to
be
a
signal
for
haste
for
the
tide
was
failing
so
that
some
of
the
foremost
men
began
to
stream
away
from
their
comrades
and
then
i
saw
that
many
carried
packs
full
of
plunder
and
also
that
the
last
of
them
were
on
the
level
so
also
saw
the
bishop
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
pointing
with
the
great
mace
he
bore
for
he
might
not
wield
sword
to
the
danes
and
saying
for
the
honour
of
dorset
for
the
holy
cross
charge
with
a
mighty
shout
we
rose
up
each
in
his
place
and
down
the
hill
we
rushed
sword
and
axe
aloft
on
that
straggling
line
then
from
the
danes
came
a
howl
of
wrath
and
terror
and
for
a
moment
dropping
their
burdens
they
fled
in
a
panic
towards
the
ships
yet
that
was
not
the
way
of
danish
men
and
vikings
and
that
flight
stayed
almost
before
it
had
gone
fifty
yards
up
rose
amidst
the
throng
a
mighty
double
axe
and
a
great
voice
was
heard
shouting
and
round
their
chief
began
to
form
a
great
ring
of
tried
warriors
shoulder
to
shoulder
as
well
as
might
be
but
that
ring
might
not
be
perfect
all
at
once
too
close
were
we
upon
them
having
already
cut
down
many
of
the
last
to
fly
and
then
the
battle
began
in
earnest
and
i
will
tell
what
i
saw
of
it
for
i
was
in
the
centre
of
our
line
as
befitted
and
on
either
side
of
me
were
wulfhere
and
wislac
and
on
either
side
of
them
again
my
collier
next
to
wulfhere
and
next
to
wislac
his
young
thane
before
me
were
guthlac
and
two
brethren
and
the
other
three
behind
me
that
was
the
standard
shield
wall
behind
that
came
ealhstan
the
bishop
hemmed
in
by
twelve
of
his
own
best
men
so
with
voice
and
gesture
of
arm
and
mace
the
bishop
swung
our
line
in
a
half
circle
round
the
face
of
that
grim
ring
of
vikings
and
as
they
closed
up
we
closed
and
faced
them
then
saw
i
that
we
were
outnumbered
by
three
to
one
but
we
were
fresh
and
they
tired
with
a
long
march
quickly
made
and
under
burdens
now
began
the
spears
to
fly
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
men
began
to
fall
and
yet
there
was
no
great
attack
made
on
either
side
then
grew
i
impatient
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
we
were
the
weaker
side
the
first
charge
might
do
all
for
us
so
i
spoke
to
wulfhere
saying
we
must
charge
before
they
let
us
break
into
that
circle
aye
said
the
veteran
and
aye
shouted
wislac
and
so
i
pointed
the
banner
forward
and
shouted
for
my
shield
men
to
charge
and
that
with
a
great
roar
they
did
and
down
before
the
brawny
arms
of
those
foremost
three
lay
brethren
went
three
of
the
heathen
and
we
were
pressing
into
the
circle
then
a
brother
fell
dragging
a
dane
with
him
and
wislac
took
his
place
and
three
more
danes
fell
then
went
aldhelm
to
wislac
side
and
lo
the
circle
was
broken
and
our
standard
stood
in
the
midst
yet
was
not
that
ring
destroyed
and
in
a
moment
it
closed
after
us
and
now
were
we
ten
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
foes
while
again
outside
them
raged
ealhstan
and
his
men
striving
to
break
through
to
us
then
knew
i
that
our
case
was
hard
and
i
struck
the
spear
that
held
the
standard
into
the
ground
and
round
it
we
stood
back
to
back
wulfhere
and
wislac
once
more
to
right
and
left
of
me
and
it
would
seem
that
so
grim
looked
we
in
our
desperation
that
they
feared
us
a
little
or
at
least
that
each
feared
to
be
the
first
to
fall
on
us
for
the
danes
drew
back
and
let
us
stand
for
a
breathing
space
until
that
great
chief
who
rallied
the
men
leaving
the
care
of
the
outer
ring
for
a
moment
came
and
faced
me
speaking
in
fair
saxon
enough
and
bidding
us
surrender
and
for
answer
i
threw
my
seax
at
him
and
as
he
raised
shield
to
stop
it
for
it
flew
straight
and
hard
as
a
forester
can
throw
i
leapt
at
him
going
in
under
his
shield
and
he
fell
heavily
moving
not
for
my
blow
went
home
well
it
was
that
wulfhere
came
after
me
for
he
warded
blow
of
axe
that
would
have
slain
me
and
then
the
danes
howled
and
fell
on
us
hard
fighting
it
was
but
round
us
grew
a
ring
of
dead
and
no
man
had
laid
hands
on
the
standard
guthlac
was
down
and
aldhelm
two
lay
brethren
also
and
we
were
all
but
sped
when
i
was
ware
of
a
saxon
shout
and
the
crash
of
a
great
mace
on
a
helmet
before
me
and
then
well
done
my
sons
cried
ealhstan
the
bishop
as
he
came
and
ringed
us
round
with
his
own
men
and
we
might
breathe
again
now
was
the
ring
of
danes
parted
and
the
ring
was
of
our
men
yet
round
it
raged
the
vikings
as
we
had
raged
round
their
ring
but
a
short
space
before
yet
every
man
of
us
knew
that
we
had
won
for
even
if
each
one
of
us
fell
before
eanulf
came
the
ships
would
not
sail
that
tide
for
the
tall
masts
were
listing
over
as
two
ships
took
the
ground
unheeded
and
four
were
hauling
out
as
the
tide
fell
and
i
thought
of
my
vision
last
night
and
of
those
i
had
seen
and
of
what
they
had
bid
me
think
of
them
and
the
roar
of
battle
went
on
unheeded
by
me
as
i
leant
against
the
standard
staff
while
i
might
and
found
my
strength
again
see
cried
wislac
pointing
and
i
looked
over
to
the
hill
where
the
road
came
down
it
was
full
of
horsemen
charging
with
levelled
spears
and
surely
that
was
osric
at
their
head
then
near
me
a
voice
cried
thrice
victory
but
it
seemed
not
as
one
of
our
men
rough
voices
but
very
strange
over
the
level
the
spearmen
swept
and
a
cry
broke
from
the
danes
as
they
saw
the
fresh
foe
upon
them
and
again
they
fell
back
from
us
quickly
and
spite
of
our
charge
on
them
and
the
spears
of
the
leading
horsemen
once
more
closed
up
into
their
iron
ring
but
now
it
was
not
motionless
but
moved
ever
towards
the
ships
going
backward
steadily
round
it
went
osric
and
his
men
but
into
it
they
could
not
break
for
the
danes
hewed
the
ash
shafts
of
the
spears
and
near
them
no
horse
might
live
for
their
axes
would
shear
through
man
and
horse
alike
then
ealhstan
shouted
to
osric
bidding
us
stand
and
right
glad
were
we
to
do
this
while
ever
the
danes
shrank
away
from
us
trapped
they
are
sheriff
said
ealhstan
when
osric
rode
up
to
him
bearing
still
a
headless
spear
let
them
bide
till
eanulf
comes
none
can
reach
the
ships
he
is
hard
behind
me
with
all
the
levy
said
osric
let
us
finish
this
without
him
but
ealhstan
shook
his
head
pointing
to
our
men
and
when
he
looked
more
coolly
he
saw
that
barely
half
of
us
were
left
and
those
worn
out
so
must
we
stand
and
wait
but
we
had
done
what
we
went
to
do
and
had
trapped
the
heathen
when
the
tide
was
low
yet
the
danes
went
steadily
back
towards
their
ships
having
yet
half
a
mile
to
cover
but
they
left
a
line
of
wounded
men
to
mark
where
they
had
gone
as
one
after
another
dropped
now
were
we
who
were
left
safe
and
knew
we
had
done
a
deed
which
would
he
told
and
sung
till
other
tales
of
victory
blotted
out
its
remembrance
if
they
might
then
ealhstan
bade
us
sit
down
for
our
horsemen
were
between
us
and
the
foe
and
thereon
he
raised
his
voice
and
with
one
accord
his
lay
brethren
and
his
own
housecarles
joined
in
singing
a
psalm
of
victory
and
it
was
just
at
the
matin
time
yet
that
psalm
ended
not
as
it
was
wont
for
ere
the
last
verses
were
sung
it
was
drowned
in
a
great
and
thundering
war
song
of
wessex
old
as
the
days
of
ceawlin
or
beyond
him
and
if
i
mistake
not
in
that
song
bishop
and
lay
brethren
joined
leaving
the
chant
for
their
own
native
and
tongue
else
would
they
have
been
the
only
men
of
all
the
host
unstirred
thereby
and
silent
now
from
that
war
song
came
a
strange
thing
it
caused
two
great
danes
to
go
berserk
in
their
rage
and
back
they
flew
on
us
their
shields
cast
aside
and
their
broad
axes
overhead
howling
and
foaming
as
they
came
one
of
osric
men
tried
to
stop
them
but
he
and
his
horse
fell
for
i
say
truth
one
leapt
high
above
the
horse
smiting
downwards
with
his
axe
so
that
the
man
was
swept
in
twain
under
that
blow
and
the
berserk
dane
came
on
unhindered
straight
for
the
standard
for
his
comrade
had
hewed
off
the
horse
head
now
i
rested
by
the
standard
a
long
spear
length
in
front
of
our
line
but
by
this
i
had
leapt
to
my
feet
and
it
was
time
for
he
was
almost
on
me
spear
had
i
none
so
i
dragged
out
the
standard
shaft
from
the
ground
where
i
had
struck
it
and
levelled
that
sharp
butt
end
full
at
his
chest
overhead
was
his
axe
again
and
i
had
no
shield
to
stop
the
blow
but
i
must
leap
aside
from
it
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
shaft
but
rushed
straight
on
it
spitting
himself
through
and
through
while
his
axe
fell
but
i
had
wrenched
myself
and
the
shaft
at
once
to
one
side
and
he
fell
over
burying
the
axe
head
in
the
ground
but
an
inch
from
the
collier
foot
yet
had
he
not
done
with
me
for
leaving
the
axe
he
clawed
the
ashen
shaft
and
dragged
himself
up
along
it
howling
not
with
the
pain
but
with
madness
and
i
must
needs
smite
him
with
my
sword
for
his
dagger
was
already
at
my
throat
then
looked
i
round
for
the
other
but
at
first
could
not
see
him
for
he
was
dead
also
pinned
to
the
ground
by
another
of
the
horsemen
from
behind
and
all
our
men
were
on
their
feet
and
the
ring
of
danes
were
shouting
and
cheering
their
two
mad
men
yet
keeping
close
order
this
seems
long
in
telling
but
it
was
all
done
in
a
flash
as
it
were
for
the
first
i
knew
of
the
coming
of
these
men
was
by
the
wheeling
of
the
horse
and
the
leaping
of
the
berserk
above
it
then
my
men
came
and
rid
the
standard
of
its
burden
not
easily
while
ealhstan
stood
with
his
arm
on
my
shoulder
looking
white
and
scared
for
that
had
been
the
greatest
danger
he
had
seen
that
day
as
he
told
me
which
indeed
it
must
have
been
for
else
he
had
never
changed
countenance
gratias
domino
he
said
verily
into
these
heathen
evil
spirits
enter
driving
them
to
death
now
have
you
fought
the
evil
one
both
spiritually
and
bodily
my
son
and
have
won
the
victory
even
as
he
spoke
the
men
being
sure
of
no
more
of
such
comings
began
to
crowd
round
me
shouting
and
cheering
as
though
i
had
done
some
great
deed
which
if
it
were
such
it
seems
to
me
that
great
deeds
are
forced
on
men
at
times
for
what
else
i
could
have
done
i
know
not
unless
as
wislac
says
i
had
run
away
even
as
he
was
minded
to
do
but
i
had
no
time
for
that
nor
do
i
believe
his
saying
concerning
himself
when
the
danes
were
nigh
their
ships
ealhstan
bade
us
tend
our
wounded
and
the
first
man
tended
was
myself
for
wulfhere
came
to
me
looking
me
over
and
at
last
binding
a
wound
on
my
left
shoulder
of
which
i
knew
not
saying
that
my
good
mail
had
surely
saved
me
he
himself
had
a
gash
across
his
face
and
wislac
one
on
the
leg
but
none
of
us
was
much
hurt
then
wislac
sought
aldhelm
whom
he
found
sitting
up
dazed
from
a
blow
across
the
helm
that
had
stunned
him
but
he
was
soon
able
to
walk
though
dizzy
and
sick
but
guthlac
was
slain
outright
and
two
others
of
the
brethren
well
so
might
i
go
on
for
of
all
our
two
hundred
men
there
were
left
but
ninety
fit
to
go
on
with
the
fight
the
rest
being
slain
or
sore
wounded
by
the
danish
axes
ealhstan
was
unhurt
for
save
that
once
when
he
had
broken
the
ring
to
reach
us
when
we
were
hemmed
in
his
men
had
kept
before
him
now
what
befell
after
that
will
not
bear
telling
for
it
was
not
long
before
eanulf
and
all
the
somerset
and
the
rest
of
the
dorset
levy
came
down
and
fell
on
the
danes
as
they
fought
their
last
fight
as
brave
men
should
with
a
quarter
mile
of
deep
mud
between
them
and
their
ships
into
that
fight
none
of
us
bishop
men
went
for
we
had
done
our
part
but
we
lay
and
saw
the
danes
charge
again
and
again
against
odds
their
line
growing
thinner
each
time
until
our
men
swept
the
last
of
them
from
the
bank
into
the
ooze
and
there
was
an
end
yet
a
few
managed
i
know
not
how
to
reach
the
ships
and
there
they
were
safe
but
thence
they
constantly
shot
their
arrows
into
our
men
harmless
enough
but
yet
showing
their
mettle
so
was
a
full
end
made
of
that
host
for
none
but
those
few
were
left
alive
from
stert
field
and
somerset
and
dorset
had
taken
their
fill
of
vengeance
but
for
all
the
victory
down
sat
ealhstan
the
bishop
and
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
wept
that
such
things
could
be
and
must
be
till
war
is
no
more
chapter
xvi
at
glastonbury
on
that
field
we
lay
all
that
day
for
we
knew
not
if
more
danes
were
left
up
country
or
if
by
chance
the
ships
might
fall
into
our
hands
with
the
rising
tide
and
i
think
we
might
have
taken
them
had
not
our
men
in
their
fury
broken
the
boats
which
lay
along
the
bank
so
that
we
could
not
put
off
to
them
therefore
as
the
tide
rose
again
and
they
floated
the
men
on
board
hauled
out
and
setting
sail
with
much
labour
for
there
were
very
few
in
each
ship
stood
off
into
mid
channel
out
of
severn
they
could
not
get
for
the
wind
was
westerly
and
the
tide
setting
eastward
so
at
last
they
brought
up
in
the
lee
of
the
two
holms
and
there
furled
sail
and
lay
at
anchor
very
stiff
and
sore
were
we
when
we
had
rested
for
a
little
and
there
fell
a
sadness
on
the
levy
now
that
the
joy
of
battle
had
gone
and
the
cost
of
victory
must
be
counted
and
that
was
heavy
for
so
manfully
and
steadily
had
the
vikings
fought
that
they
had
accounted
for
man
to
man
as
nearly
as
one
might
count
either
slain
or
maimed
now
on
this
matter
i
heard
wislac
speak
to
aldhelm
who
sat
facing
him
and
holding
his
aching
head
with
both
hands
so
friend
quoth
wislac
as
touching
that
matter
of
dispute
we
had
how
stands
the
account
i
know
not
nor
care
said
aldhelm
all
i
wot
is
that
my
head
is
like
to
split
nay
that
will
it
not
having
stood
such
a
stout
blow
said
wislac
laughing
cheer
up
and
count
our
score
of
heads
i
can
count
but
one
head
and
that
my
own
let
it
bide
so
that
is
better
said
wislac
i
should
surely
have
been
slain
five
times
by
my
own
count
but
it
seems
i
am
wrong
wherefore
i
must
have
escaped
somehow
and
that
is
all
i
know
about
it
then
he
turned
to
me
and
asked
if
i
had
noted
any
doings
at
all
and
when
i
thought
all
i
could
remember
plainly
were
the
fall
of
the
tall
chief
i
slew
and
the
coming
of
ealhstan
and
the
attack
of
the
berserk
and
no
more
all
the
rest
was
confused
and
like
a
dream
so
i
said
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
had
had
no
time
to
do
more
than
mind
ourselves
but
that
withal
my
shield
wall
had
kept
the
standard
and
that
kept
there
need
be
no
question
as
to
who
had
done
best
then
wislac
nodded
after
his
wont
and
said
that
if
aldhelm
was
content
so
was
he
whereupon
aldhelm
held
out
his
hand
and
said
that
wislac
was
wise
and
he
foolish
and
wislac
grasping
it
answered
that
it
was
a
lucky
foolishness
that
had
brought
so
stout
a
comrade
to
his
side
for
had
it
not
been
for
aldhelm
putting
his
thick
head
betwixt
him
and
an
axe
slain
he
would
have
been
aye
brother
he
said
deny
it
not
for
i
saw
you
thrust
yourself
forward
and
save
me
by
yourself
which
doubtless
is
your
way
of
settling
a
grudge
brother
and
a
good
one
so
those
two
were
sworn
friends
from
that
day
forward
as
were
many
another
couple
who
met
on
that
field
for
the
first
time
fighting
side
by
side
for
wessex
thus
wore
away
the
day
and
the
next
night
and
with
the
morning
those
ships
were
yet
under
the
holms
swinging
at
their
anchors
for
the
westerly
breeze
held
then
said
eanulf
let
them
be
harm
can
they
do
none
being
so
few
they
will
go
with
the
shift
of
wind
but
the
shift
of
wind
came
not
for
days
and
days
and
there
they
lay
never
putting
out
from
shelter
and
they
are
out
of
my
story
so
that
i
will
say
what
befell
them
one
night
it
freshened
up
to
a
gale
and
in
the
morning
there
were
five
ships
where
six
had
been
one
had
sunk
at
her
moorings
then
men
said
that
the
danes
had
made
a
hut
on
the
flat
holm
plain
to
be
seen
from
the
nearest
shore
and
at
last
a
shift
of
wind
came
and
they
put
not
out
so
certain
fishers
dared
to
sail
across
and
spy
what
was
amiss
and
finding
no
man
in
the
ships
nor
seeing
any
about
the
hut
went
ashore
none
hindering
them
ships
and
hut
and
shore
were
but
the
resting
place
of
the
dead
for
after
a
while
they
had
no
food
left
and
were
too
few
and
weak
even
to
man
one
ship
and
go
many
a
long
year
it
was
before
the
king
of
their
land
norse
or
dane
whichever
he
was
learned
what
had
befallen
his
host
and
how
their
bones
lay
on
the
wessex
shore
and
islands
for
not
one
of
all
that
had
sailed
that
spring
returned
to
give
the
news
or
to
tell
how
his
comrades
died
on
stert
fighting
to
the
last
and
on
the
island
wishing
they
had
fallen
with
the
slain
now
must
i
tell
how
we
went
back
to
glastonbury
town
marching
proudly
as
became
conquerors
while
on
every
side
was
shouting
of
men
and
at
the
same
time
weeping
of
women
for
those
who
had
fallen
when
we
came
to
the
great
square
there
stood
tatwine
the
abbot
and
all
his
monks
but
i
had
no
eyes
for
them
for
there
with
abbess
and
nuns
stood
alswythe
smiling
on
me
through
tears
of
joy
and
though
her
cheeks
were
thinner
and
paler
by
reason
of
fasting
and
prayer
for
us
all
looking
most
beautiful
and
to
me
like
a
vision
of
some
saint
that
was
all
i
could
see
of
her
then
for
we
must
kneel
while
a
great
te
deum
was
sung
and
then
crowd
into
the
abbey
to
hear
mass
once
more
then
after
that
was
over
there
was
a
great
feast
in
the
wide
hall
of
the
abbey
where
ealhstan
and
eanulf
sat
side
by
side
in
the
high
seats
and
on
their
right
osric
and
myself
and
on
the
left
wulfhere
and
wislac
none
grudging
those
chief
places
to
the
men
who
had
kept
the
standard
and
broken
the
danish
ring
when
the
feasting
was
done
then
came
the
telling
of
great
deeds
over
the
ale
cup
and
that
lasted
long
and
many
were
the
brave
men
praised
nor
were
the
deeds
of
the
vikings
as
brave
foes
forgotten
for
men
praised
them
also
moreover
the
gleemen
sang
of
the
fight
and
in
those
songs
my
name
came
so
often
as
needs
it
must
seeing
that
i
bore
the
standard
that
i
will
not
set
them
down
nor
is
there
need
for
the
housecarles
sing
them
even
yet
now
before
we
went
to
rest
eanulf
bade
me
wait
on
him
early
in
the
morning
and
so
being
refreshed
by
a
long
quiet
night
i
went
to
him
as
he
had
bidden
me
there
he
thanked
me
as
man
to
man
for
that
crossing
of
parret
and
for
staying
the
going
of
the
danes
saying
that
a
greater
man
than
he
should
add
to
the
thanks
for
needs
must
that
one
took
word
of
all
that
had
befallen
to
ethelwulf
the
king
and
that
to
be
such
a
messenger
was
most
honourable
therefore
should
i
myself
bear
the
news
taking
with
me
my
two
friends
and
such
men
as
i
chose
and
should
bear
written
down
the
reports
of
both
osric
and
ealhstan
besides
his
own
else
said
he
there
are
perhaps
some
to
whom
credit
is
due
whose
names
may
pass
unmentioned
and
thanking
him
i
said
that
that
was
likely
for
i
knew
few
in
the
levy
which
came
from
far
and
wide
whereat
he
laughed
saying
that
i
was
either
very
modest
or
very
simple
so
i
knew
that
he
spoke
of
myself
and
thanked
him
again
nay
he
said
small
thanks
to
me
for
if
i
did
you
not
justice
the
men
would
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
asked
me
about
the
business
of
my
trial
and
what
i
thought
of
it
bidding
me
tell
him
as
a
friend
thinking
naught
of
the
judge
and
that
i
was
able
to
do
now
without
passion
so
far
off
and
small
a
thing
it
seemed
after
all
these
stirring
doings
and
i
knew
that
but
for
it
i
had
been
only
a
foolish
thane
and
slain
maybe
over
my
feasting
in
my
own
hall
or
on
combwich
hill
with
my
back
to
the
foe
beside
matelgar
now
when
i
had
ended
my
tale
and
my
thoughts
concerning
it
he
told
me
that
he
had
found
out
much
of
late
as
he
and
the
thanes
spoke
together
here
while
waiting
for
the
levy
and
that
word
should
go
to
the
king
of
the
whole
matter
so
that
without
waiting
for
the
moot
he
should
inlaw
me
again
then
i
knew
not
enough
to
say
but
he
clapped
me
on
the
shoulder
saying
that
he
had
been
an
unjust
judge
for
once
and
that
i
must
be
heedful
if
ever
i
sat
in
his
place
and
so
bid
me
go
and
find
my
friends
and
get
ready
to
ride
to
salisbury
where
the
king
lay
having
moved
from
winchester
nearer
to
us
that
went
i
to
do
with
a
light
heart
and
only
sorry
that
i
might
not
see
alswythe
before
i
went
and
this
i
told
wislac
who
looked
oddly
at
me
and
then
laughed
saying
that
he
believed
i
feared
an
old
nun
more
than
a
wild
berserk
and
true
it
was
that
i
was
afraid
of
that
stately
abbess
though
not
in
the
same
way
as
one
fears
a
raging
madman
flying
on
one
pluck
up
courage
said
he
and
go
and
ask
the
old
dame
to
let
you
have
speech
with
your
lady
and
if
she
grants
it
not
i
am
mistaken
for
the
lady
is
not
one
of
her
nuns
and
there
is
a
guest
chamber
for
such
folk
as
bishop
men
surely
that
was
good
counsel
and
so
i
went
to
the
nunnery
trembling
first
because
i
was
afraid
and
next
lest
i
might
not
see
alswythe
now
that
wondrous
silver
mail
of
mine
was
too
easily
known
and
so
soon
as
i
got
out
into
the
street
the
beggar
men
began
to
shout
and
crawl
towards
me
and
then
others
looked
and
ran
and
then
more
till
there
was
a
crowd
of
men
of
the
levy
pressing
round
me
stretching
hands
to
pat
me
and
the
like
then
one
stood
in
front
of
me
hands
on
hips
and
stared
at
me
and
all
at
once
he
shouted
ho
comrades
this
is
the
saint
of
cannington
hill
i
saw
him
there
and
soundly
did
he
rate
me
for
running
even
as
i
deserved
and
at
that
there
was
a
mighty
shouting
and
crowding
so
that
i
could
in
no
wise
go
on
my
way
and
i
began
to
wax
wroth
my
back
was
to
the
abbey
gates
which
were
closed
after
me
by
the
porter
and
just
then
i
saw
some
of
the
men
look
up
over
my
head
and
point
and
laugh
so
i
turned
round
and
there
were
eanulf
and
osric
on
the
gateway
battlements
looking
on
as
drawn
thither
by
the
noise
and
just
then
eanulf
laughing
made
some
sign
or
speech
which
i
could
not
hear
to
the
men
who
cheered
and
soon
they
brought
a
great
shield
and
on
that
set
me
in
spite
of
myself
raising
me
up
shoulder
high
and
saluting
me
as
the
man
who
had
gained
all
the
honour
and
victory
there
must
i
lie
still
lest
i
should
fall
and
be
made
to
look
more
foolish
yet
and
when
i
sat
up
crosslegged
thereon
they
stopped
shouting
and
stared
at
me
let
me
down
ye
pigs
said
i
very
cross
and
unmindful
of
the
honour
they
would
do
me
speak
to
us
thane
speak
to
us
they
cried
and
one
he
who
knew
me
at
cannington
after
the
first
fight
added
aye
thane
you
made
us
strong
again
on
the
hill
the
other
day
blaming
us
rightly
praise
us
now
if
that
may
be
then
i
cast
about
for
what
to
say
not
being
a
great
hand
at
speaking
though
maybe
when
real
occasion
is
the
words
have
come
fast
enough
howbeit
this
was
in
coolness
but
i
knew
that
they
were
worthy
of
praise
so
i
said
well
have
ye
done
every
man
of
you
even
as
i
knew
ye
would
when
once
ye
turned
to
bay
and
if
the
danes
come
again
as
i
think
they
will
not
speedily
fight
as
ye
fought
at
stert
and
there
will
be
victory
again
then
they
cheered
and
shouted
again
louder
than
before
and
i
made
to
leap
down
but
they
would
not
suffer
me
then
said
i
let
me
go
for
i
have
an
errand
whereupon
the
men
who
held
the
shield
and
could
hear
me
amid
the
slackening
uproar
asked
where
i
would
go
and
being
dazed
by
the
noise
and
tumult
like
an
owl
in
daylight
i
must
needs
answer
without
thinking
to
the
great
nunnery
and
the
end
of
that
foolishness
was
that
they
bore
me
thither
for
it
was
not
far
with
a
great
crowd
of
all
sorts
following
and
shouting
and
there
must
i
stand
with
all
that
tail
after
me
while
they
beat
on
the
gates
in
such
sort
that
the
poor
nuns
must
have
thought
the
danes
at
their
doorstep
but
i
held
up
my
hand
for
silence
not
thinking
it
would
come
but
as
it
were
by
nature
longing
for
it
and
instantly
all
the
crowd
was
hushed
and
that
surprised
me
though
when
i
told
wulfhere
thereof
he
said
it
was
no
wonder
seeing
which
i
begged
them
all
to
go
away
and
not
scare
the
holy
women
who
were
used
to
quiet
in
the
place
and
then
i
remembered
the
honour
the
honest
warriors
had
meant
this
for
and
thanked
them
bidding
them
make
allowances
for
my
being
put
out
at
first
then
took
they
off
their
helms
and
shouted
thrice
and
then
fled
rapidly
for
the
gates
opened
behind
me
and
there
was
the
abbess
herself
with
her
cheeks
red
and
her
eyes
burning
bright
in
anger
as
i
thought
while
behind
her
peeped
all
her
nuns
at
the
crowded
street
and
at
myself
standing
shamefaced
on
the
steps
doffing
my
helm
as
i
saw
her
but
instead
of
being
angry
she
held
out
both
her
hands
and
spoke
kindly
saying
never
has
our
quiet
place
heard
such
clamour
before
but
we
women
will
not
be
behind
the
men
in
welcoming
heregar
and
so
she
bade
the
nuns
come
forward
laying
her
hands
on
my
shoulder
and
adding
see
daughters
this
is
he
who
dared
to
warn
the
land
of
its
danger
saving
the
lives
of
our
sisters
of
bridgwater
and
many
others
and
who
has
even
now
led
the
host
and
conquered
giving
us
safety
and
peaceful
rest
again
but
i
knelt
and
kissed
her
hand
while
there
went
a
little
murmur
among
the
nuns
then
the
lady
abbess
touched
gently
my
bound
shoulder
and
said
that
the
hurt
was
but
rudely
tended
and
that
she
must
bind
it
afresh
so
should
she
show
her
gratitude
to
one
who
had
bled
for
the
land
and
they
led
me
into
the
courtyard
and
thence
to
the
guest
chamber
and
there
waited
alswythe
now
when
i
looked
to
see
her
greet
me
formally
as
in
the
presence
of
the
abbess
she
ran
into
my
arms
and
i
found
that
we
were
alone
then
must
she
hear
and
i
tell
all
that
had
happened
to
me
since
we
parted
but
that
was
too
long
for
the
telling
then
for
very
soon
the
abbess
came
with
clatter
of
vessels
along
the
passage
bringing
warm
water
and
salves
to
bind
my
small
wound
afresh
and
in
that
alswythe
helped
her
with
many
pitying
words
and
soft
touches
so
that
i
thought
it
good
to
be
hurt
if
such
tendance
might
ever
be
had
and
many
things
they
asked
as
of
wulfhere
safety
and
the
collier
and
of
how
i
got
that
wound
and
the
like
and
that
last
i
could
not
tell
them
marvelling
myself
when
it
came
and
more
that
it
was
the
only
one
but
i
know
i
smote
flatwise
once
or
twice
myself
in
the
heat
of
fight
so
doubtless
it
was
so
with
others
else
would
aldhelm
have
been
in
halves
or
thereabouts
then
i
told
them
of
my
message
to
the
king
and
at
that
alswythe
rejoiced
and
the
abbess
said
that
doubtless
the
king
would
reward
the
messenger
and
what
reward
would
i
ask
an
he
did
so
now
there
was
only
one
reward
to
me
in
all
the
world
and
for
answer
i
took
alswythe
hand
all
wet
with
the
water
she
bathed
my
hurt
with
and
kissed
it
on
which
the
maiden
blushed
and
looked
down
but
the
abbess
laughed
softly
saying
verily
i
thought
so
and
then
seemed
to
choke
a
little
turning
away
from
us
and
alswythe
did
not
draw
away
her
hand
from
mine
but
let
her
cheek
rest
for
a
moment
against
my
head
and
so
there
was
a
little
silence
then
the
abbess
turned
round
again
and
her
eyes
were
bright
but
the
shine
was
of
tears
in
them
and
she
spoke
briskly
now
must
you
get
hence
heregar
my
son
and
go
your
way
to
the
king
with
all
haste
so
shall
you
be
back
the
sooner
give
him
a
scarf
to
bind
that
wound
alswythe
so
shall
it
seem
an
honour
and
not
a
scar
so
there
was
a
little
leave
taking
but
not
much
though
enough
and
i
went
from
the
nunnery
with
alswythe
white
and
red
and
gold
scarf
over
my
shoulder
gay
enough
to
look
at
but
no
gayer
than
the
heart
beneath
it
and
there
waiting
for
me
in
the
street
was
my
tail
armed
and
drawn
up
in
line
of
fours
to
see
me
back
to
the
abbey
so
i
went
there
at
the
head
of
them
with
more
shouting
of
people
there
was
wulfhere
sitting
on
the
doorsteps
of
the
great
door
having
a
bag
in
his
hand
and
when
i
got
up
to
him
he
thrust
it
out
to
me
saying
largess
and
that
i
was
glad
enough
to
understand
so
i
put
my
hand
into
the
bag
and
crying
here
is
withal
to
drink
to
somerset
and
dorset
shoulder
to
shoulder
scattered
the
silver
pennies
among
them
and
so
left
them
without
any
order
among
them
at
all
though
shoulder
to
shoulder
certainly
ho
master
said
wulfhere
you
looked
mighty
angry
when
you
were
carried
aloft
an
hour
ago
aye
said
i
is
pity
a
thane
can
not
walk
abroad
quietly
on
his
own
business
well
well
they
thought
that
you
were
their
business
doubtless
whence
came
all
those
pennies
i
asked
for
we
had
no
store
at
all
to
cast
away
from
eanulf
and
ealhstan
said
wulfhere
laughing
they
came
to
me
and
saying
that
they
were
sore
jealous
and
minded
to
have
good
cause
therefor
gave
me
this
that
you
might
carry
off
all
well
to
the
end
and
that
was
good
of
them
for
else
i
know
not
how
i
should
have
left
the
men
without
more
speech
making
just
then
came
the
ealdorman
into
the
hall
where
we
were
and
laughing
asked
me
if
i
meant
to
take
all
that
following
to
salisbury
but
i
only
wanted
the
standard
guards
who
were
left
and
aldhelm
as
one
who
had
fought
as
such
this
i
had
told
wulfhere
before
so
that
i
was
not
surprised
when
i
heard
that
all
were
ready
and
but
waiting
for
me
to
set
off
then
eanulf
and
osric
took
me
to
the
bishop
and
there
gave
me
writings
to
deliver
to
the
king
and
also
bade
me
tell
all
that
he
asked
in
my
own
way
and
those
three
saw
us
set
forth
all
well
mounted
and
a
goodly
company
to
look
at
the
bishop
blessing
us
before
we
went
and
the
people
and
warriors
following
and
cheering
us
on
our
way
through
the
town
and
even
some
way
beyond
the
walls
chapter
xvii
alfred
the
atheling
of
our
long
ride
to
the
king
place
there
is
little
to
tell
only
that
everywhere
the
news
seemed
to
have
flown
before
us
and
men
knew
who
we
were
and
what
our
errand
crowding
round
us
to
hear
all
about
the
fighting
and
to
be
assured
that
the
danes
had
truly
gone
and
great
cheer
made
they
for
us
everywhere
so
that
we
were
treated
as
princes
almost
therefore
that
was
a
merry
ride
and
a
pleasant
in
the
early
june
weather
and
we
were
ever
cheerful
for
it
so
happened
as
may
have
been
already
seen
that
no
one
of
us
had
lost
close
friend
or
kin
in
the
battles
but
had
the
rather
gained
much
yet
maybe
we
were
the
only
ones
of
whom
that
might
be
said
for
mixed
with
the
joy
was
mourning
over
all
the
land
and
of
all
my
company
i
had
the
most
cause
to
be
lighthearted
so
that
for
all
i
had
gained
i
thought
the
hard
things
i
had
gone
through
were
well
worth
the
bearing
ever
therefore
have
i
judged
him
the
happiest
who
out
of
hardship
gains
rest
for
he
best
knows
its
worth
so
at
last
we
came
to
salisbury
town
and
that
was
full
of
a
brilliant
company
the
courtiers
of
the
king
and
their
following
again
yet
for
all
their
magnificence
thanks
to
our
good
bishop
gifts
we
showed
well
as
we
rode
into
the
streets
and
i
think
were
envied
by
many
because
the
marks
of
honourable
war
were
yet
on
us
so
that
the
men
spoke
of
aldhelm
crushed
headpiece
or
wulfhere
gashed
shield
that
bore
the
mark
of
the
axe
that
he
stopped
from
me
or
my
riven
mail
that
alswythe
scarf
would
scarcely
hide
and
wislac
broken
crest
and
if
they
looked
from
us
to
our
men
there
was
yet
more
of
the
like
to
speak
about
for
not
one
of
the
standard
guard
had
been
scatheless
from
heavy
weapon
play
being
thus
marked
we
were
easy
to
be
known
and
hardly
had
we
drawn
rein
at
the
great
hostelry
where
we
should
wait
till
the
king
summoned
us
when
a
thane
came
to
me
asking
if
we
were
from
bishop
or
ealdorman
and
when
i
said
we
were
so
bearing
letters
from
them
he
bade
us
to
the
king
presence
at
once
tarrying
for
nothing
as
we
were
waited
for
fain
would
we
have
washed
away
the
stains
of
travel
but
he
was
urgent
saying
that
the
king
word
brooked
no
delay
therefore
leaving
our
horses
with
the
people
of
the
inn
we
followed
him
marching
in
order
to
the
great
house
where
ethelwulf
was
here
were
guards
and
many
thanes
and
i
must
show
the
tokens
given
me
before
we
might
enter
while
our
thane
stood
by
impatient
at
the
formalities
those
over
we
came
to
a
greet
hall
with
oak
and
carved
everywhere
and
strewn
with
sweet
sedges
and
on
the
high
place
sat
the
king
and
queen
and
one
of
the
athelings
now
i
had
never
seen
the
king
before
but
i
thought
him
like
all
that
i
had
heard
of
in
stories
for
he
sat
in
his
purple
robes
having
on
a
little
gold
crown
over
his
long
curling
hair
and
his
gloves
and
shoes
were
of
cloth
of
gold
curiously
wrought
with
pearls
while
at
his
feet
sat
a
page
holding
a
cushion
whereon
lay
sceptre
and
orb
but
i
looked
to
see
the
face
of
a
warrior
under
the
gold
circle
of
the
king
and
therein
was
disappointed
for
his
face
was
kind
and
gentle
as
many
a
good
warrior
has
been
in
time
of
peace
but
lacked
those
lines
which
a
man
might
know
would
harden
into
grimness
and
strength
in
time
of
need
and
i
thought
that
ealhstan
was
like
a
king
and
ethelwulf
like
a
bishop
rather
yet
by
the
king
side
leaning
on
his
chair
was
one
whom
i
then
noted
not
having
eyes
only
for
his
father
alfred
the
atheling
who
to
my
mind
is
both
warrior
and
saint
as
though
ethelwulf
his
father
and
ealhstan
his
teacher
had
each
taught
him
the
properties
of
the
other
making
a
perfect
king
now
while
i
looked
our
guide
went
and
made
obeisance
before
the
king
telling
him
of
our
coming
and
at
that
the
face
of
ethelwulf
lighted
up
and
he
called
to
us
to
come
near
and
give
our
message
and
i
saw
the
queen
clasp
her
hands
as
preparing
to
hear
things
all
too
heavy
for
a
lady
ear
while
the
atheling
stood
up
and
gazed
eagerly
at
us
then
too
over
all
the
court
was
deep
silence
as
they
made
a
lane
through
which
we
must
pass
to
reach
the
throne
and
our
feet
seemed
to
make
all
the
sound
there
was
so
we
tramped
up
and
bowed
low
before
the
king
who
ran
his
eyes
over
us
though
not
as
a
captain
but
as
one
who
knows
men
of
all
sorts
well
and
is
accustomed
to
judge
their
faces
then
he
said
to
me
you
are
heregar
the
bishop
standard
bearer
we
have
heard
of
you
as
such
and
welcome
you
knowing
you
must
bring
good
news
as
your
face
tells
me
i
am
heregar
lord
king
i
answered
and
i
bring
good
news
written
in
these
which
i
am
to
give
into
your
own
hand
then
the
king
smiled
a
little
and
signed
the
atheling
to
take
the
letters
and
give
them
him
but
i
not
knowing
court
ways
must
needs
think
this
beside
my
duty
and
said
quickly
not
knowing
to
whom
i
spoke
pardon
me
thane
i
am
to
give
these
into
the
king
own
hand
and
so
stepped
past
him
holding
out
the
letters
to
ethelwulf
and
at
that
the
atheling
laughed
outright
which
was
strange
to
me
in
the
king
presence
saying
not
so
far
wrong
standard
bearer
if
not
very
polite
and
so
stepped
back
to
his
place
still
laughing
but
ethelwulf
did
not
notice
this
having
taken
the
letters
eagerly
from
me
and
broken
open
the
first
that
came
now
when
he
had
read
the
first
few
lines
he
looked
up
and
reading
from
the
letter
which
doubtless
told
him
the
names
of
the
bearers
heregar
i
know
he
said
which
is
wulfhere
then
wulfhere
bowed
and
the
king
asked
for
wislac
and
aldhelm
and
then
for
each
of
the
men
in
turn
and
when
each
had
answered
he
looked
hard
at
us
still
holding
the
letter
open
but
saying
nothing
and
then
fell
to
reading
again
so
we
must
stand
still
till
all
those
letters
were
read
presently
he
took
one
and
reading
the
outside
gave
it
to
the
atheling
saying
it
was
to
him
and
went
on
reading
that
the
atheling
took
and
as
he
read
looked
at
us
and
it
seemed
particularly
at
me
though
i
thought
nothing
of
that
at
last
the
king
finished
and
turned
to
a
tall
warrior
who
stood
very
near
the
dais
bidding
him
treat
us
with
all
honour
and
see
to
our
lodging
near
him
while
we
were
at
court
shortly
he
said
he
would
speak
to
us
of
all
we
could
tell
him
then
he
held
out
his
ungloved
hand
to
us
which
the
atheling
made
a
smiling
sign
for
me
to
kiss
and
that
we
all
did
and
then
he
looked
pleasantly
at
us
and
went
his
way
from
the
hall
followed
by
his
close
attendants
with
the
queen
and
the
atheling
so
soon
as
the
king
was
gone
the
talk
began
all
over
the
hall
and
most
of
all
they
crowded
round
us
to
learn
what
we
could
tell
them
but
that
tall
thane
whose
name
was
ceorle
came
and
took
us
away
telling
the
rest
jestingly
that
they
should
have
the
second
telling
of
the
news
but
that
the
king
must
have
the
first
and
so
he
took
us
to
guest
chambers
in
his
own
house
and
there
left
us
in
charge
of
his
steward
treating
us
four
thanes
with
all
honour
and
our
men
as
became
their
standing
among
his
own
best
men
at
least
this
last
was
but
for
a
short
time
for
the
lay
brethren
came
to
me
looking
oddly
at
me
and
saying
that
they
were
in
a
strait
for
being
lay
brethren
first
and
warriors
after
they
knew
not
how
to
join
in
the
talk
and
idle
jests
of
the
servants
and
housecarles
moreover
they
said
that
their
vows
obliged
them
to
certain
duties
of
prayer
and
this
i
thought
was
honest
of
them
for
many
a
lay
brother
would
when
he
found
that
i
noted
not
their
state
have
broken
out
of
bounds
gladly
for
the
time
so
i
sent
for
the
steward
and
asked
him
where
they
might
be
bestowed
and
after
a
little
thought
he
said
that
the
abbot
who
had
a
following
of
honest
housecarles
would
take
them
in
and
that
he
managed
for
us
and
afterwards
told
me
that
ealhstan
men
had
gained
great
praise
both
for
themselves
and
the
bishop
by
their
ways
in
the
abbey
this
is
a
little
thing
but
i
tell
it
because
it
shows
what
sort
of
man
bishop
ealhstan
was
for
even
over
these
rough
warriors
he
had
gained
such
a
power
for
good
that
he
had
made
of
them
all
he
wished
sturdy
champions
of
the
faith
both
bodily
and
spiritually
so
when
those
three
were
gone
elsewhere
our
only
serving
man
was
my
collier
and
well
was
he
treated
in
ceorle
house
we
bided
quietly
there
all
the
rest
of
that
day
and
that
night
and
then
in
the
morning
were
bidden
to
speak
with
the
king
ceorle
taking
us
four
himself
and
sending
one
to
find
the
lay
brethren
and
dudda
the
king
sat
with
alfred
the
atheling
in
a
private
chamber
no
other
but
ceorle
being
beside
him
while
we
were
there
and
i
was
a
little
frightened
about
my
putting
aside
the
young
prince
now
for
i
knew
who
he
was
from
ceorle
but
he
had
a
pleasant
look
and
greeting
for
us
as
we
came
in
so
also
had
ethelwulf
himself
who
seemed
less
stately
than
yesterday
when
he
sat
in
his
royal
attire
in
full
court
richly
dressed
he
was
now
with
a
gold
circlet
on
his
head
and
great
gold
bracelets
on
his
arms
but
he
was
in
no
high
place
only
sitting
easily
in
a
carved
and
cushioned
chair
while
the
atheling
sat
on
a
settle
by
the
window
the
letters
i
had
brought
lay
open
on
the
table
at
the
king
elbow
and
his
hand
was
on
them
and
there
were
other
writings
scattered
about
great
ones
with
red
seals
hanging
thereto
made
no
doubt
by
the
gold
signet
which
stood
close
by
in
its
open
casket
come
near
thanes
the
king
said
in
his
deep
quiet
voice
let
us
talk
together
of
this
matter
as
friends
for
a
useless
king
were
i
but
for
such
as
you
who
keep
my
throne
from
the
blows
of
enemies
stay
father
said
alfred
the
atheling
starting
up
let
me
write
while
the
thanes
speak
and
he
gathered
up
pens
and
such
and
a
roll
of
parchment
sitting
down
at
the
table
and
then
holding
pen
ready
and
looking
at
us
the
king
smiled
at
him
and
his
haste
and
said
verily
thanes
you
must
mind
your
words
if
alfred
writes
them
down
for
he
will
ever
keep
records
of
tales
such
as
yours
saying
that
they
are
for
men
to
read
hereafter
but
that
had
no
terrors
for
us
seeing
that
we
had
a
plain
tale
to
tell
truth
and
nothing
more
so
as
ceorle
bid
us
we
four
sat
down
by
the
window
and
the
king
asked
me
to
tell
my
story
from
the
first
so
i
began
by
saying
that
i
had
seen
the
landing
of
the
danes
at
stert
and
warned
the
watchmen
of
the
levy
there
alfred
stopped
me
holding
up
his
pen
suddenly
tell
us
thane
of
the
watchet
landing
he
said
and
when
i
began
to
tell
of
that
he
looked
up
again
with
his
eyes
dancing
and
asked
me
how
i
came
on
quantock
hill
thereat
the
king
laughed
a
little
saying
that
alfred
should
have
been
a
lawman
and
the
atheling
said
that
with
his
father
help
he
meant
to
be
such
and
a
good
one
and
that
he
has
become
for
the
laws
he
has
given
us
will
last
as
it
seems
to
me
till
the
name
of
saxon
has
departed
then
i
was
a
little
in
doubt
what
to
say
and
the
king
saw
this
so
he
told
me
kindly
that
he
had
had
very
full
accounts
written
by
the
bishop
and
ealdormen
but
now
both
he
and
the
atheling
would
fain
hear
about
myself
that
is
if
my
friends
already
knew
all
and
if
i
would
not
heed
ceorle
now
i
saw
that
i
must
speak
more
of
myself
than
i
wished
and
would
fain
have
been
excused
saying
something
of
that
sort
but
the
atheling
asked
me
to
think
of
them
as
friends
who
would
feel
for
me
saying
too
that
of
my
own
history
he
would
not
write
and
so
kindly
did
he
urge
me
drawing
me
on
that
at
last
i
had
told
him
all
from
the
beginning
of
my
troubles
even
to
the
time
when
i
rode
with
alswythe
into
glastonbury
and
sought
the
bishop
that
is
well
told
said
alfred
when
i
had
finished
so
far
and
the
king
sighed
a
little
but
left
all
the
speaking
to
his
son
now
wulfhere
he
went
on
it
is
your
turn
and
so
made
the
old
warrior
take
up
the
tale
but
he
bade
him
begin
at
the
first
fight
however
wulfhere
must
needs
go
back
to
the
war
arrow
business
and
then
to
the
staying
of
the
flight
at
cannington
and
in
this
alfred
did
not
stop
him
though
i
thought
it
more
than
needed
so
he
told
all
his
tale
even
to
the
slaying
of
the
berserk
and
things
like
that
and
as
he
told
of
the
breaking
of
the
ring
and
our
stand
inside
of
it
alfred
the
atheling
wrote
fast
and
presently
he
bade
wulfhere
cease
and
going
to
a
corner
took
down
a
harp
while
his
father
smiled
on
him
and
tuning
it
broke
out
into
a
wondrous
war
song
that
made
our
hearts
beat
fast
for
we
seemed
to
feel
that
it
was
full
of
the
very
shout
and
ring
of
battle
inside
our
circle
of
foes
and
we
were
as
men
who
looked
on
and
saw
our
own
deeds
over
again
only
made
more
glorious
by
the
hand
of
the
poet
and
the
voice
of
the
singer
so
that
when
he
ended
the
king
eyes
flashed
and
ceorle
face
was
red
and
good
to
look
at
with
a
war
light
on
it
and
wislac
shouted
as
i
had
nearly
done
but
at
that
sound
strange
in
the
king
presence
we
all
started
and
wislac
seemed
abashed
truly
lord
king
he
said
humbly
i
could
not
help
it
almost
had
i
done
as
you
did
said
the
kindly
king
alfred
must
bear
the
blame
now
shall
you
tell
your
story
but
wislac
said
he
had
nought
to
add
to
wulfhere
tale
save
that
aldhelm
here
had
saved
him
at
his
own
cost
and
that
he
had
had
moreover
as
much
fighting
as
he
was
like
ever
to
want
but
even
from
him
alfred
gained
many
things
about
the
fighting
and
from
aldhelm
also
and
these
he
wrote
down
thus
we
all
told
our
tales
and
they
were
long
in
the
telling
so
that
when
aldhelm
had
finished
the
king
rose
up
blaming
alfred
gently
for
the
long
sitting
saying
however
that
he
had
feared
somewhat
of
the
sort
but
that
doubtless
the
thanes
were
more
wearied
than
either
of
the
other
three
who
had
listened
now
he
said
well
have
you
four
thanes
deserved
of
me
and
of
all
and
you
shall
not
say
that
the
king
is
ungrateful
and
i
think
that
each
of
you
has
said
less
of
your
own
selves
than
might
be
said
or
indeed
than
is
said
in
these
letters
now
have
ceorle
and
i
and
my
council
spoken
of
this
matter
and
we
have
thought
of
rewards
fitting
for
the
shield
wall
of
the
standard
then
would
we
thank
the
king
but
he
bade
us
wait
for
a
little
putting
his
hand
on
those
great
parchments
with
the
seals
one
of
these
he
took
and
gave
to
aldhelm
this
is
to
your
father
confirming
his
rights
of
the
land
he
holds
of
me
to
him
and
his
heirs
for
ever
by
reason
of
your
good
service
yet
is
there
a
little
blame
to
you
from
the
way
in
which
you
found
a
foremost
place
though
much
praise
for
the
holding
thereof
and
in
your
manner
of
ending
that
quarrel
so
aldhelm
took
the
deed
and
kissed
the
king
hand
in
token
of
homage
going
to
his
place
very
glad
for
this
was
what
his
father
desired
most
of
all
then
the
king
beckoned
wislac
and
gave
him
also
a
deed
like
aldhelm
granting
him
the
lordship
of
the
manor
of
goring
on
the
thames
and
that
was
a
good
reward
to
the
stout
mercian
who
thanked
the
king
saying
that
he
wotted
not
how
his
majesty
knew
what
he
would
have
most
wished
whereupon
the
king
laughed
saying
that
kings
knew
more
than
men
gave
them
credit
for
and
so
wislac
did
homage
and
sat
down
then
ethelwulf
looked
at
wulfhere
and
said
wulfhere
my
old
warrior
i
know
not
rightly
what
to
do
with
you
for
you
are
a
lonely
man
and
i
think
that
a
place
in
my
court
would
not
suit
you
nor
would
you
care
to
hold
a
manor
in
a
strange
place
wait
a
little
and
we
will
think
it
over
now
at
that
wulfhere
looked
glad
for
i
think
he
feared
rather
than
desired
reward
now
came
my
turn
and
my
face
flushed
and
i
was
a
little
frightened
for
there
was
but
one
thing
i
wanted
and
i
feared
that
that
might
not
be
but
the
king
made
a
step
towards
me
and
took
me
by
the
hand
looking
hard
at
me
heregar
he
said
yours
has
been
a
strange
story
and
from
beginning
to
end
you
have
been
first
in
this
victory
that
will
gain
us
peace
for
many
years
to
come
moreover
you
have
suffered
wrong
being
punished
for
evil
falsely
laid
to
your
charge
on
my
account
and
that
i
must
show
all
men
to
be
untrue
and
that
i
the
king
hold
it
so
now
shall
you
choose
your
own
reward
then
was
i
sorely
abashed
not
knowing
how
to
say
what
i
longed
for
and
the
king
stood
waiting
a
little
and
maybe
i
should
never
have
got
it
out
but
the
atheling
looked
up
and
said
may
i
speak
for
you
heregar
and
so
plainly
did
i
see
that
he
knew
all
that
i
asked
him
to
do
so
and
he
came
beside
me
and
said
heregar
needs
but
one
thing
my
father
and
that
is
the
hand
of
the
maiden
he
loves
alswythe
the
daughter
of
matelgar
and
your
ward
since
her
father
was
slain
are
you
so
foolish
as
to
ask
no
more
than
that
said
the
king
smiling
and
on
that
my
tongue
was
loosed
and
i
answered
aye
my
lord
the
king
if
foolish
it
be
to
long
for
the
one
whom
a
man
loves
and
who
loves
him
so
that
he
holds
her
beyond
all
other
reward
then
is
your
request
granted
said
the
king
very
kindly
yet
must
you
have
withal
to
keep
so
great
a
treasure
rightly
now
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
landless
and
well
it
was
for
me
that
the
king
went
on
quickly
so
i
give
you
the
lands
that
were
matelgar
and
your
own
lands
again
and
my
men
and
at
my
cost
shall
build
your
halls
afresh
that
the
danes
have
burnt
and
whatever
rights
were
matelgar
or
your
father
shall
be
confirmed
to
you
and
yours
for
ever
yet
these
things
are
but
justice
and
no
reward
so
he
paused
a
little
and
i
found
courage
to
speak
my
lord
the
king
i
need
no
more
than
you
have
given
for
love
and
honour
and
lands
have
come
back
to
me
and
withal
friendship
of
these
three
here
and
of
ealhstan
the
bishop
and
of
the
noble
ealdormen
while
but
for
what
has
befallen
i
might
have
been
still
a
careless
thane
living
at
ease
and
for
naught
but
now
having
heard
your
good
words
it
is
enough
and
reward
fit
for
any
man
and
this
i
meant
from
my
heart
for
no
more
could
i
see
that
any
man
should
need
than
this
honour
of
his
fellows
and
of
the
king
and
love
and
lands
and
friends
surely
is
a
man
rich
in
these
things
yet
must
alfred
the
atheling
add
a
word
call
me
your
friend
also
heregar
if
you
will
for
fain
would
i
be
so
and
he
held
out
his
strong
white
hand
to
take
mine
and
it
is
good
to
think
that
as
it
were
the
grasp
of
his
has
never
slackened
from
that
day
to
this
but
that
he
is
my
friend
still
then
ceorle
must
say
likewise
and
last
of
all
the
king
said
friend
to
all
my
people
would
i
be
and
to
none
more
than
to
those
who
have
risked
life
for
the
land
therefore
to
you
and
yours
am
i
friend
always
so
that
you
shall
ever
think
of
me
as
friend
first
and
king
after
nor
is
it
to
everyone
that
i
dare
say
that
heregar
my
friend
and
he
took
my
hand
also
as
the
atheling
and
ceorle
had
taken
it
so
was
i
fain
to
weep
for
very
joy
at
all
this
that
had
come
to
me
and
must
turn
away
for
a
little
lest
it
should
be
seen
then
the
king
spoke
cheerfully
as
on
business
now
heregar
i
have
work
for
you
to
do
in
your
home
for
i
would
have
no
man
idle
here
is
watchet
town
burnt
up
and
no
man
left
for
its
lord
is
slain
to
see
that
it
is
built
aright
and
that
each
man
or
family
has
his
own
again
now
you
knew
that
place
well
nor
is
it
very
far
from
you
therefore
shall
you
see
to
all
that
and
you
shall
have
writings
from
me
to
back
you
but
men
must
know
that
you
yourself
have
power
there
and
therefore
i
make
you
lord
of
all
quantock
side
from
watchet
stream
to
parret
and
from
the
borders
of
your
own
land
at
cannington
to
severn
shore
between
those
two
and
this
shall
you
render
in
return
for
those
rights
that
you
shall
be
ready
at
all
times
to
bear
the
standard
of
wessex
against
all
comers
from
over
seas
at
my
bidding
now
that
was
the
dragon
of
wessex
of
which
the
old
witch
spoke
and
lo
those
things
that
had
been
foretold
of
me
were
sooth
and
i
knelt
before
the
king
and
swore
to
bear
him
this
service
faithfully
so
the
rest
bore
witness
of
that
oath
gladly
rejoicing
in
the
honour
which
was
in
truth
to
them
as
well
as
to
me
for
i
could
not
have
gone
through
aught
without
them
and
if
mine
was
the
grip
on
banner
shaft
theirs
were
the
hands
that
had
kept
it
there
then
said
ethelwulf
choose
now
one
who
shall
have
charge
under
you
of
the
watchings
and
beacons
on
your
shore
and
straightway
i
turned
to
wulfhere
and
begged
him
to
do
this
for
me
and
it
was
good
to
see
the
warrior
face
light
up
with
gladness
as
he
promised
to
give
me
his
help
doubtless
that
was
what
the
king
had
in
store
for
him
for
at
once
he
gave
him
the
manor
of
the
watchet
thane
who
had
been
slain
for
as
it
chanced
he
had
no
heirs
and
the
land
came
back
to
the
king
that
was
the
end
of
a
long
morning
work
and
very
kindly
did
ethelwulf
take
his
leave
of
us
saying
that
we
must
have
these
matters
confirmed
when
the
witan
xii
met
in
two
days
time
so
we
went
out
landed
men
and
noble
and
with
us
went
the
atheling
who
took
us
to
his
own
lodgings
at
the
abbey
where
he
would
see
and
speak
to
our
men
that
he
might
write
yet
more
from
their
lips
for
he
said
that
often
it
was
good
to
hear
what
the
common
sort
thought
and
my
collier
must
needs
tell
him
for
he
was
very
pleasant
so
that
none
need
fear
his
rank
of
grendel
and
also
of
the
saint
which
mightily
pleased
the
atheling
so
that
often
would
he
call
me
grendel
in
sport
thereafter
for
we
grew
close
friends
in
the
time
we
bided
at
salisbury
and
that
seemed
long
to
me
for
now
would
i
fain
be
back
at
glastonbury
with
alswythe
soon
wislac
also
grew
tired
of
the
court
and
said
that
he
longed
for
the
deep
meadows
and
lofty
trees
and
green
downs
along
the
clear
river
in
this
june
time
and
must
seek
his
own
home
again
but
it
seemed
that
alfred
him
for
reasons
which
he
told
me
not
and
he
stayed
we
went
to
the
great
meeting
of
the
witan
taking
our
seats
there
when
our
rights
were
confirmed
to
us
and
into
my
hands
was
put
the
standard
of
wessex
by
the
king
himself
and
i
bore
it
to
the
great
church
there
to
be
blessed
in
the
bearing
thereof
and
there
stood
ealhstan
himself
in
his
robes
having
come
even
that
morning
for
this
very
purpose
and
that
was
pleasant
and
even
as
i
should
have
most
wished
moreover
my
friends
and
alfred
and
ceorle
stood
by
me
as
if
for
shield
wall
at
that
time
and
i
was
well
attended
now
betimes
in
the
afternoon
came
alfred
the
atheling
to
me
as
i
sat
with
ceorle
talking
of
the
arms
of
the
vikings
and
asked
me
to
come
and
speak
with
friends
of
his
who
would
not
see
him
save
he
brought
me
and
at
that
ceorle
laughed
saying
that
they
must
be
of
importance
if
they
would
deny
the
prince
an
audience
making
conditions
and
alfred
said
very
gravely
that
they
were
so
and
maybe
the
only
people
save
the
king
and
queen
who
might
delay
seeing
him
so
i
was
curious
to
know
who
these
were
but
we
left
ceorle
still
laughing
then
alfred
took
me
to
the
abbey
and
sent
one
of
his
men
to
say
we
had
come
who
when
he
returned
bade
us
into
the
presence
of
these
people
when
we
came
to
a
great
door
in
a
part
of
the
abbey
where
i
had
not
before
been
he
took
my
arm
and
pushed
me
in
first
saying
that
he
would
ensure
himself
a
good
reception
and
there
sat
ealhstan
and
beside
him
stood
alswythe
smiling
at
me
and
with
a
little
colour
in
her
face
chapter
xviii
peace
in
the
land
now
of
the
wedding
in
the
great
church
i
knew
very
little
save
that
i
had
alswythe
beside
me
and
that
ealhstan
married
us
and
that
was
all
i
cared
for
heeding
naught
of
the
rest
but
the
king
and
the
queen
were
there
and
many
thanes
while
the
atheling
must
needs
be
a
groomsman
with
my
friends
and
ceorle
gave
away
the
bride
on
the
king
behalf
there
too
was
eanulf
looking
very
noble
in
his
court
array
beside
the
king
and
the
little
page
in
blue
and
silver
who
held
alswythe
dress
was
none
other
than
turkil
grendel
friend
as
alfred
called
him
whom
alswythe
had
begged
the
bishop
to
bring
with
him
there
also
was
dudda
the
collier
clad
beyond
knowledge
by
wislac
holding
my
helm
and
sword
and
the
lay
brethren
mail
clad
for
the
last
time
with
the
white
cross
painted
on
their
shields
and
helms
lustily
did
they
join
in
the
chanting
osric
only
was
not
there
but
on
alswythe
neck
and
arms
shone
presently
collar
and
bracelets
of
gold
that
he
had
sent
having
had
them
made
from
the
spoils
of
that
tall
viking
chief
that
i
had
slain
then
was
there
feasting
and
songs
of
gleemen
and
better
still
that
song
of
stert
fight
sung
by
alfred
the
atheling
himself
in
full
hall
and
then
had
wislac
full
excuse
for
what
he
did
in
the
king
presence
for
at
the
end
all
the
hall
joined
in
a
mighty
wessex
war
shout
and
that
said
the
atheling
was
a
poet
greatest
praise
to
have
stirred
the
hearts
of
men
to
forgetfulness
of
aught
but
the
song
now
when
we
must
needs
ride
away
westward
with
wulfhere
and
aldhelm
for
attendants
and
the
collier
and
my
lay
brethren
again
for
guards
the
king
gave
alswythe
a
ring
praying
her
to
spare
me
to
him
if
need
should
be
and
she
half
weeping
yet
proudly
told
him
that
she
would
be
the
first
to
arm
me
for
his
service
and
the
queen
kissed
her
but
the
atheling
said
that
soon
he
should
see
us
again
for
he
would
ride
with
me
over
the
and
learn
it
all
when
our
hall
was
ready
for
a
guest
then
wislac
took
leave
of
us
last
of
all
even
as
we
started
for
he
said
he
would
have
no
long
leave
taking
nor
did
he
know
if
he
must
not
come
with
alfred
to
fight
the
battle
over
again
and
we
prayed
him
to
do
so
for
i
loved
the
quaint
sayings
and
cool
valour
of
the
thane
but
eanulf
and
ceorle
rode
with
many
of
the
thanes
a
mile
or
more
with
us
on
our
way
from
the
town
and
there
having
set
us
fairly
off
left
us
with
hearty
but
they
left
one
behind
who
joined
himself
to
our
little
company
and
that
was
turkil
clad
like
myself
in
silver
mail
and
on
a
white
pony
but
with
cloak
and
scarf
for
that
was
the
atheling
doing
when
he
knew
that
grendel
friend
was
to
be
brought
up
in
our
hall
to
grow
into
the
stout
warrior
i
had
boded
him
to
be
now
should
my
story
be
ended
were
it
a
fairy
tale
but
it
is
not
that
well
i
knew
that
happy
as
i
was
the
day
must
come
when
i
must
bear
forward
to
battle
the
golden
dragon
banner
of
wessex
and
i
can
not
rightly
tell
if
i
dreaded
or
longed
for
that
day
maybe
there
was
a
mixture
of
both
dread
and
longing
in
my
thoughts
thereof
but
when
we
came
over
brent
knoll
on
our
way
back
to
my
place
and
alswythe
at
cannington
there
lay
the
black
ships
under
the
holms
yet
and
there
too
were
the
burnt
walls
of
our
houses
though
these
were
rising
up
again
as
the
king
men
wrought
at
them
and
all
the
land
lay
waste
and
neglected
and
as
we
rode
over
cannington
hill
a
broken
helm
rolled
from
my
horse
hoof
from
among
the
grass
of
the
roadside
those
things
brought
back
to
us
the
memory
of
war
and
trouble
even
in
our
new
happiness
and
there
over
the
river
was
the
mound
over
elgar
the
man
who
had
died
for
his
land
and
not
in
vain
it
was
many
days
since
we
started
from
salisbury
town
however
before
we
came
to
cannington
and
in
that
time
we
had
sought
the
house
of
turkil
father
the
franklin
lodging
with
him
for
a
day
and
night
that
we
might
seek
leofwine
the
hermit
but
him
we
might
not
find
for
he
was
dead
and
that
grieved
me
sorely
for
i
would
fain
have
seen
him
again
aye
and
if
it
might
be
taken
him
to
live
with
us
but
he
died
as
the
tide
went
out
on
the
day
of
stert
fight
and
those
who
stood
by
him
say
that
he
had
visions
of
all
that
befell
there
for
many
times
he
called
to
me
as
exhorting
me
and
once
after
long
silence
in
the
gray
of
early
dawn
he
rose
up
crying
up
ealhstan
up
for
the
lord
has
delivered
these
heathen
into
your
hands
and
that
was
at
the
time
when
the
bishop
had
heard
those
words
spoken
to
him
and
again
once
more
he
roused
even
at
the
time
when
the
danes
drew
off
from
us
at
the
coming
of
osric
he
lifted
his
hands
crying
victory
thrice
and
then
saying
very
softly
heregar
my
son
was
silent
thereafter
till
he
died
at
the
time
of
the
lowest
ebb
only
his
lips
moving
as
if
in
prayer
and
i
remembered
the
strange
voice
i
had
heard
crying
round
me
and
i
wept
for
i
thought
how
much
more
was
wrought
by
the
prayers
of
feeble
ones
than
men
wot
of
but
his
prophecy
had
indeed
come
true
and
though
i
might
not
see
him
more
the
memory
of
leofwine
is
with
me
always
with
his
words
of
wise
counsel
that
he
had
spoken
to
me
now
of
that
other
one
who
prophesied
in
her
strange
way
to
me
i
know
no
more
nor
did
i
ever
see
her
again
gundred
the
witch
men
called
her
knowing
her
well
and
fearing
her
but
she
was
never
seen
after
the
danes
swept
over
our
land
and
how
she
ended
none
ever
knew
i
sought
her
carefully
that
i
might
give
her
shelter
and
ease
for
the
rest
of
her
days
but
without
avail
all
his
life
long
has
dudda
the
collier
bided
with
me
serving
well
and
roughly
but
in
all
most
faithfully
as
is
his
wont
and
not
many
days
after
we
came
homewards
he
brought
me
the
berserk
axe
to
hang
in
hall
for
he
had
taken
it
and
hidden
it
when
we
left
the
battlefield
on
the
day
after
the
fight
so
there
it
is
now
and
beside
it
hangs
the
raven
flag
of
the
largest
ship
for
he
must
needs
go
with
the
fishers
across
to
the
holms
and
bring
me
back
the
tale
of
how
the
last
of
the
danes
had
perished
and
now
what
am
i
to
say
of
the
years
since
our
hall
was
built
again
long
have
they
been
and
not
all
happy
for
many
a
time
have
i
had
to
bear
the
standard
of
wessex
against
the
danes
yet
stert
fight
won
us
six
years
of
peace
and
after
that
the
earl
ceorle
and
i
led
our
levies
and
conquered
at
wenbury
but
that
was
wulfhere
last
fight
for
of
his
wounds
he
might
not
recover
though
we
bore
him
back
and
tended
him
carefully
for
a
month
or
more
so
he
lies
in
god
acre
at
cannington
and
is
at
rest
then
came
long
years
of
fighting
and
ever
i
bore
the
banner
and
ever
alswythe
set
me
forth
most
lovingly
with
brave
words
that
should
bide
with
me
till
i
came
back
to
her
and
all
the
time
our
hall
was
safe
for
beyond
parret
the
danes
came
not
again
and
to
tell
of
all
those
fights
were
too
long
or
of
how
wislac
and
aldhelm
would
ever
fight
beside
me
as
of
old
and
at
last
turkil
in
aldhelm
place
when
that
brave
thane
fell
at
wilton
fighting
for
alfred
the
king
then
were
we
in
athelney
with
alfred
and
it
was
the
collier
who
found
us
that
place
of
safety
and
thence
we
went
at
last
to
victory
again
and
now
once
more
the
land
has
rest
yet
wislac
is
with
us
in
wulfhere
place
for
his
own
land
is
in
danish
hands
and
we
know
not
what
wars
may
be
yet
with
them
though
we
have
stood
by
the
king
side
when
the
greatest
victory
of
all
was
won
and
guthrum
the
heathen
became
athelstan
the
christian
and
peaceful
division
of
the
land
was
made
