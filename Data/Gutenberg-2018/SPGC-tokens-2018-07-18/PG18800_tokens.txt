last
enemy
was
the
toughest
of
all
and
conquering
him
was
in
itself
almost
as
dangerous
as
not
conquering
for
a
strange
pattern
of

an
honorable

illustration
along
the
table
the
subdued
clatter
of
dinnerware
and
the
buzz
of
conversation
was
dying
out
the
soft
music
that
drifted
down
from
the
overhead
sound
outlets
seemed
louder
as
the
competing
noises
diminished
the
feast
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
dallona
of
hadron
fidgeted
nervously
with
the
stem
of
her
wineglass
as
doubts
assailed
her
the
old
man
at
whose
right
she
sat
noticed
and
reached
out
to
lay
his
hand
on
hers
my
dear
you
worried
he
said
softly
you
of
all
people
should
be
you
know
the
theory
is
complete
she
replied
and
i
could
wish
for
more
positive
verification
i
hate
to
think
i
got
you
into
this
garnon
of
roxor
laughed
no
no
he
assured
her
i
decided
upon
this
long
before
you
announced
the
results
of
your
experiments
ask
girzon
he
bear
me
out
that
true
the
young
man
who
sat
at
garnon
left
said
leaning
forward
father
has
meant
to
take
this
step
for
a
long
time
he
was
waiting
until
after
the
election
and
then
he
decided
to
do
it
now
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
make
experimental
use
of
it
the
man
on
dallona
right
added
his
voice
like
the
others
at
the
table
he
was
of
medium
stature
and
with
a
wide
mouth
prominent
cheekbones
and
a
short
square
jaw
unlike
the
others
he
was
armed
with
a
knife
and
pistol
on
his
belt
and
on
the
breast
of
his
black
tunic
he
wore
a
scarlet
oval
patch
on
which
a
pair
of
black
wings
with
a
tapering
silver
object
between
them
had
been
superimposed
yes
lady
dallona
the
lord
garnon
and
i
discussed
this
oh
two
years
ago
at
the
least
really
i
surprised
that
you
seem
to
shrink
from
it
now
of
course
you
and
customs
there
may
be
different
but
with
your
scientific
knowledge
that
may
be
the
trouble
dirzed
dallona
told
him
a
scientist
gets
in
the
way
of
doubting
and
one
doubts
one
own
theories
most
of
all
that
the
scientific
attitude
i
told
dirzed
replied
smiling
but
somehow
i
can
not
think
of
you
as
a
scientist
his
eyes
traveled
over
her
in
a
way
that
would
have
made
most
women
scientists
or
otherwise
blush
it
gave
dallona
of
hadron
a
feeling
of
pleasure
men
often
looked
at
her
that
way
especially
here
at
darsh
novelty
had
something
to
do
with
it
her
skin
was
considerably
lighter
than
usual
and
there
was
a
pleasing
oddness
about
the
structure
of
her
face
her
alleged
venusian
origin
was
probably
accepted
as
the
explanation
of
that
as
of
so
many
other
things
as
she
was
about
to
reply
a
man
in
dark
gray
one
of
the
who
were
accepted
as
social
equals
by
the
nobles
approached
the
table
he
nodded
respectfully
to
garnon
of
roxor
i
hate
to
seem
to
hurry
things
sir
but
the
boy
ready
he
in
a
now
he
reported
pointing
to
the
pair
of
visiplates
at
the
end
of
the
room
both
of
the
plates
were
activated
one
was
a
solid
luminous
white
on
the
other
was
the
image
of
a
boy
of
twelve
or
fourteen
seated
at
a
big
writing
machine
even
allowing
for
the
fact
that
the
boy
was
in
a
hypnotic
trance
there
was
an
expression
of
idiocy
on
his
face
a
pervading
dullness
one
of
our
best
sensitives
a
man
with
a
beard
several
places
down
the
table
on
dallona
right
said
you
remember
him
dallona
he
produced
that
communication
from
the
discarnate
assassin
sirzim
normally
he
a
imbecile
but
in
wonderful
and
there
can
be
no
argument
that
the
communications
he
produces
originates
in
his
own
mind
he
does
have
mind
enough
of
his
own
to
operate
that
machine
garnon
of
roxor
rose
to
his
feet
the
others
rising
with
him
he
unfastened
a
jewel
from
the
front
of
his
tunic
and
handed
it
to
dallona
here
my
dear
lady
dallona
i
want
you
to
have
this
he
said
been
in
the
family
of
roxor
for
six
generations
but
i
know
that
you
will
appreciate
and
cherish
it
he
twisted
a
heavy
ring
from
his
left
hand
and
gave
it
to
his
son
he
unstrapped
his
wrist
watch
and
passed
it
across
the
table
to
the
he
gave
a
pocket
case
containing
writing
tools
slide
rule
and
magnifier
to
the
bearded
man
on
the
other
side
of
dallona
something
you
can
use
harnosh
he
said
then
he
took
a
belt
with
a
knife
and
holstered
pistol
from
a
servant
who
had
brought
it
to
him
and
gave
it
to
the
man
with
the
red
badge
and
something
for
you
dirzed
the
by
farnor
of
yand
and
the
knife
was
forged
and
tempered
on
luna
the
man
with
the
badge
took
the
weapons
exclaiming
in
appreciation
then
he
removed
his
own
belt
and
buckled
on
the
gift
the
pistol
fully
loaded
garnon
told
him
dirzed
drew
it
and
checked
a
man
of
his
craft
took
no
statement
about
weapons
without
verification
then
slipped
it
back
into
the
holster
shall
i
use
it
he
asked
by
all
means
i
had
that
in
mind
when
i
selected
it
for
you
another
man
to
the
left
of
girzon
received
a
cigarette
case
and
lighter
he
and
garnon
hooked
fingers
and
clapped
shoulders
our
views
have
been
the
same
garnon
he
said
but
i
always
valued
your
friendship
i
sorry
you
doing
this
now
i
believe
you
be
disappointed
garnon
chuckled
would
you
care
to
make
a
small
wager
on
that
nirzav
he
asked
you
know
what
i
putting
up
if
i
proven
right
will
you
accept
the
volitionalist
theory
as
verified
nirzav
chewed
his
mustache
for
a
moment
yes
garnon
i
will
he
pointed
toward
the
blankly
white
screen
if
we
get
anything
conclusive
on
that
i
have
no
other
choice
all
right
friends
garnon
said
to
those
around
him
will
you
walk
with
me
to
the
end
of
the
room
servants
removed
a
section
from
the
table
in
front
of
him
to
allow
him
and
a
few
others
to
pass
through
the
rest
of
the
guests
remained
standing
at
the
table
facing
toward
the
inside
of
the
room
son
girzon
and
the
nirzav
of
shonna
walked
on
his
left
dallona
of
hadron
and
harnosh
of
hosh
on
his
right
the
and
two
or
three
ladies
and
a
nobleman
with
a
small
and
several
others
joined
them
of
those
who
had
sat
close
to
garnon
only
the
man
in
the
black
tunic
with
the
scarlet
badge
hung
back
he
stood
still
by
the
break
in
the
table
watching
garnon
of
roxor
walk
away
from
him
then
dirzed
the
assassin
drew
the
pistol
he
had
lately
received
as
a
gift
hefted
it
in
his
hand
thumbed
off
the
safety
and
aimed
at
the
back
of
garnon
head
they
had
nearly
reached
the
end
of
the
room
when
the
pistol
cracked
dallona
of
hadron
started
almost
as
though
the
bullet
had
crashed
into
her
own
body
then
caught
herself
and
kept
on
walking
she
closed
her
eyes
and
laid
a
hand
on
harnosh
arm
for
guidance
concentrating
her
mind
upon
a
single
question
the
others
went
on
as
though
garnon
of
roxor
were
still
walking
among
them
look
harnosh
of
hosh
cried
pointing
to
the
image
in
the
visiplate
ahead
he
under
control
they
all
stopped
short
and
dirzed
holstering
his
pistol
hurried
forward
to
join
them
behind
a
couple
of
servants
had
approached
with
a
stretcher
and
were
gathering
up
the
crumpled
figure
that
had
a
moment
ago
been
garnon
a
change
had
come
over
the
boy
at
the
writing
machine
his
eyes
were
still
glazed
with
the
stupor
of
the
hypnotic
trance
but
the
slack
jaw
had
stiffened
and
the
loose
mouth
was
compressed
in
a
purposeful
line
as
they
watched
his
hands
went
out
to
the
keyboard
in
front
of
him
and
began
to
move
over
it
and
as
they
did
letters
appeared
on
the
white
screen
on
the
left
of
roxor
discarnate
they
read
the
machine
stopped
for
a
moment
then
began
again
dallona
of
hadron
the
question
you
asked
after
i
discarnated
was
what
was
the
last
book
i
read
before
the
feast
while
waiting
for
my
valet
to
prepare
my
bath
i
read
the
first
ten
verses
of
the
fourth
canto
of
splendor
of
space
by
larnov
of
horka
in
my
bedroom
when
the
bath
was
ready
i
marked
the
page
with
a
strip
of
message
tape
containing
a
message
from
the
bailiff
of
my
estate
on
the
shevva
river
concerning
a
breakdown
at
the
power
plant
and
laid
the
book
on
the
table
beside
the
big
red
harnosh
of
hosh
looked
at
dallona
inquiringly
she
nodded
i
rejected
the
question
i
had
in
my
mind
and
substituted
that
one
after
the
shot
she
said
he
turned
quickly
to
the
check
on
that
right
away
kirzon
he
directed
as
the
hurried
out
the
writing
machine
started
again
to
my
son
girzon
i
will
not
use
your
son
garnon
as
a
i
will
remain
discarnate
until
he
is
grown
and
has
a
son
of
his
own
if
he
has
no
male
child
i
will
reincarnate
in
the
first
available
male
child
of
the
family
of
roxor
or
of
some
family
allied
to
us
by
marriage
in
any
case
i
will
communicate
before
nirzav
of
shonna
ten
days
ago
when
i
dined
at
your
home
i
took
a
small
knife
and
cut
three
notches
two
close
together
and
one
a
little
apart
from
the
others
on
the
under
side
of
the
table
as
i
remember
i
sat
two
places
down
on
the
left
if
you
find
them
you
will
know
that
i
have
won
that
wager
that
i
spoke
of
a
few
minutes
i
have
my
butler
check
on
that
right
away
nirzav
said
his
eyes
were
wide
with
amazement
and
he
had
begun
to
sweat
a
man
does
not
casually
watch
the
beliefs
of
a
lifetime
invalidated
in
a
few
moments
dirzed
the
the
machine
continued
have
served
me
faithfully
in
the
last
ten
years
never
more
so
than
with
the
last
shot
you
fired
in
my
service
after
you
fired
the
thought
was
in
your
mind
that
you
would
like
to
take
service
with
the
lady
dallona
of
hadron
whom
you
believe
will
need
the
protection
of
a
member
of
the
society
of
assassins
i
advise
you
to
do
so
and
i
advise
her
to
accept
your
offer
her
work
since
she
has
come
to
darsh
has
not
made
her
popular
in
some
quarters
no
doubt
nirzav
of
shonna
can
bear
me
out
on
i
wo
betray
things
told
me
in
confidence
or
said
at
the
councils
of
the
statisticalists
but
he
right
nirzav
said
you
need
a
good
assassin
and
there
are
few
better
than
dirzed
see
that
this
sensitive
is
growing
the
letters
on
the
screen
spelled
out
body
is
not
strong
enough
for
prolonged
communication
i
bid
you
all
farewell
for
the
time
i
will
communicate
again
good
evening
my
friends
and
i
thank
you
for
your
presence
at
the
the
boy
on
the
other
screen
slumped
back
in
his
chair
his
face
relaxing
into
its
customary
expression
of
vacancy
will
you
accept
my
offer
of
service
lady
dallona
dirzed
asked
it
as
garnon
said
you
made
enemies
dallona
smiled
at
him
i
not
been
too
deep
in
my
work
to
know
that
i
glad
to
accept
your
offer
dirzed
nirzav
of
shonna
had
already
turned
away
from
the
group
and
was
hurrying
from
the
room
to
call
his
home
for
confirmation
on
the
notches
made
on
the
underside
of
his
dining
table
as
he
went
out
the
door
he
almost
collided
with
the
who
was
rushing
in
with
a
book
in
his
hand
here
it
is
the
latter
exclaimed
holding
up
the
book
of
space
just
where
he
said
it
would
be
i
had
a
couple
of
servants
with
me
as
witnesses
i
can
call
them
in
now
if
you
wish
he
handed
the
book
to
harnosh
of
hosh
see
a
strip
of
message
tape
in
it
at
the
tenth
verse
of
the
fourth
canto
nirzav
of
shonna
the
room
he
was
chewing
his
mustache
and
muttering
to
himself
as
he
rejoined
the
group
in
front
of
the
now
dark
visiplates
he
raised
his
voice
addressing
them
all
generally
my
butler
found
the
notches
just
as
the
communication
described
he
said
this
settles
it
garnon
if
you
where
you
can
hear
me
you
won
i
ca
believe
in
the
statisticalist
doctrines
after
this
or
in
the
political
program
based
upon
them
i
announce
my
change
of
attitude
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
executive
council
and
resign
my
seat
i
was
elected
by
statisticalist
votes
and
i
can
not
hold
office
as
a
volitionalist
you
need
a
couple
of
assassins
too
the
nobleman
with
the
told
him
your
former
colleagues
and
are
regrettably
given
to
the
forcible
discarnation
of
those
who
differ
with
them
i
never
employed
personal
assassins
before
nirzav
replied
but
i
think
you
right
as
soon
as
i
get
home
i
call
assassins
hall
and
make
the
necessary
arrangements
better
do
it
now
girzon
of
roxor
told
him
lowering
his
voice
there
are
over
a
hundred
guests
here
and
i
ca
vouch
for
all
of
them
the
statisticalists
would
be
sure
to
have
a
spy
planted
among
them
my
father
was
one
of
their
most
dangerous
opponents
when
he
was
on
the
council
they
always
been
afraid
he
come
out
of
retirement
and
stand
for
they
want
to
make
sure
he
was
really
discarnate
and
if
that
the
case
you
can
be
sure
your
change
of
attitude
is
known
to
old
mirzark
of
bashad
by
this
time
he
wo
dare
allow
you
to
make
a
public
renunciation
of
statisticalism
he
turned
to
the
other
nobleman
prince
jirzyn
why
do
you
call
the
volitionist
headquarters
and
have
a
couple
of
our
assassins
sent
here
to
escort
lord
nirzav
home
i
do
that
immediately
jirzyn
of
starpha
said
it
as
lord
girzon
says
we
can
be
pretty
sure
there
was
a
spy
among
the
guests
and
now
that
you
come
over
to
our
way
of
thinking
responsible
for
your
safety
he
left
the
room
to
make
the
necessary
visiphone
call
dallona
accompanied
by
dirzed
returned
to
her
place
at
the
table
where
she
was
joined
by
harnosh
of
hosh
and
some
of
the
others
there
no
question
about
the
results
harnosh
was
exulting
grant
that
the
boy
might
have
picked
up
some
of
that
stuff
telepathically
from
the
carnate
minds
present
here
even
from
the
mind
of
garnon
before
he
was
discarnated
but
he
could
not
have
picked
up
enough
data
in
that
way
to
make
a
connected
and
coherent
communication
it
takes
a
sensitive
with
a
powerful
mind
of
his
own
to
practice
telesthesia
and
that
boy
almost
an
idiot
he
turned
to
dallona
you
asked
a
question
mentally
after
garnon
was
discarnate
and
got
an
answer
that
could
have
been
contained
only
in
garnon
mind
i
think
it
conclusive
proof
that
the
discarnate
garnon
was
fully
conscious
and
communicating
dirzed
also
asked
a
question
mentally
after
the
discarnation
and
got
an
answer
harnosh
we
can
state
positively
that
the
surviving
individuality
is
fully
conscious
in
the
discarnate
state
is
telepathically
sensitive
and
is
capable
of
telepathic
communication
with
other
minds
dallona
agreed
and
in
view
of
our
earlier
work
with
we
justified
in
stating
positively
that
the
individual
is
capable
of
exercising
choice
in
reincarnation
vehicles
my
father
had
been
considering
voluntary
discarnation
for
a
long
time
girzon
of
roxor
said
ever
since
the
discarnation
of
my
mother
he
deferred
that
step
because
he
was
unwilling
to
deprive
the
volitionalist
party
of
his
support
now
it
would
seem
that
he
has
done
more
to
combat
statisticalism
by
discarnating
than
he
ever
did
in
his
carnate
existence
i
do
know
girzon
jirzyn
of
starpha
said
as
he
joined
the
group
the
statisticalists
will
denounce
the
whole
thing
as
a
prearranged
fraud
and
if
they
can
discarnate
the
lady
dallona
before
she
can
record
her
testimony
under
truth
hypnosis
or
on
a
lie
detector
we
no
better
off
than
we
were
before
dirzed
you
have
a
great
responsibility
in
guarding
the
lady
dallona
some
extraordinary
security
precautions
will
be
needed
in
his
office
in
the
first
level
city
of
dhergabar
tortha
karf
chief
of
paratime
police
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
to
hold
his
lighter
for
his
special
assistant
verkan
vall
then
lit
his
own
cigarette
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
his
three
hundredth
birthday
was
only
a
decade
or
so
off
and
he
had
begun
to
acquire
a
double
chin
and
a
bulge
at
his
waistline
his
hair
once
black
had
turned
a
uniform
and
was
beginning
to
thin
in
front
what
do
you
know
about
the
second
level
sector
vall
he
inquired
ever
work
in
that
verkan
vall
handsome
features
became
even
more
immobile
than
usual
as
he
mentally
pronounced
the
verbal
trigger
symbols
which
should
bring
knowledge
into
his
conscious
mind
then
he
shook
his
head
must
be
a
singularly
sector
sir
he
said
or
else
we
been
lucky
so
far
i
never
was
on
an
operation
even
have
a
for
that
sector
all
i
know
is
from
general
reading
like
all
the
second
level
its
descend
from
the
probability
of
one
or
more
shiploads
of
colonists
having
come
to
terra
from
mars
about
to
a
hundred
thousand
years
ago
and
then
having
been
cut
off
from
the
home
planet
and
forced
to
develop
a
civilization
of
their
own
here
the
civilization
is
of
a
fairly
high
even
for
second
level
an
interplanetary
culture
direct
conversion
of
nuclear
energy
to
electrical
power
that
sort
of
thing
we
buy
fine
synthetic
plastics
and
fabrics
from
them
he
fingered
the
material
of
his
green
police
uniform
i
think
this
cloth
is
we
sell
a
lot
of
venusian
they
smoke
it
straight
and
mixed
with
tobacco
they
have
a
single
government
a
single
race
and
a
universal
language
they
a
race
which
evolved
in
its
present
form
about
fifty
thousand
years
ago
the
present
civilization
is
about
ten
thousand
years
old
developed
out
of
the
wreckage
of
several
earlier
civilizations
which
decayed
or
fell
through
wars
exhaustion
of
resources
et
cetera
they
have
legends
maybe
historical
records
of
their
extraterrestrial
origin
tortha
karf
nodded
pretty
good
for
consciously
acquired
knowledge
he
commented
well
our
luck
run
out
on
that
sector
we
have
troubles
there
now
i
want
you
to
go
iron
them
out
i
know
been
going
pretty
hard
lately
that
nighthound
business
on
the
fourth
level
sector
was
any
picnic
but
the
fact
is
that
a
lot
of
my
ordinary
and
deputy
assistants
have
a
little
too
much
regard
for
the
alleged
sanctity
of
human
life
and
this
is
something
that
may
need
some
pretty
drastic
action
some
of
our
people
getting
out
of
line
verkan
vall
asked
well
the
data
is
too
complete
but
one
of
our
people
has
run
into
trouble
on
that
sector
and
needs
rescuing
a
researcher
a
young
lady
named
hadron
dalla
i
believe
you
know
her
do
you
tortha
karf
asked
innocently
slightly
verkan
vall
deadpanned
i
enjoyed
a
brief
but
rather
hectic
with
her
about
twenty
years
ago
what
sort
of
a
jam
little
dalla
got
herself
into
now
well
frankly
we
do
know
i
hope
she
still
alive
but
i
not
unduly
optimistic
it
seems
that
about
a
year
ago
hadron
transposed
to
the
second
level
to
study
alleged
proof
of
reincarnation
which
the
people
were
reported
to
possess
she
went
to
gindrabar
on
venus
and
transposed
to
the
second
paratime
level
to
a
station
maintained
by
outtime
import
export
trading
corporation
a
plantation
just
east
of
the
high
ridge
country
there
she
assumed
an
identity
as
the
daughter
of
a
planter
and
took
the
name
of
dallona
of
hadron
parenthetically
all
are
prepositional
were
originally
place
names
i
believe
that
ancient
marital
relations
were
too
complicated
to
permit
exact
establishment
of
paternity
and
all
men
personal
names
have
or
inserted
in
the
middle
and
women
names
end
in
or
you
could
call
yourself
virzal
of
verkan
for
instance
anyhow
she
made
the
second
level
trip
on
a
regular
passenger
liner
and
landed
at
the
city
of
ghamma
on
the
upper
nile
there
she
established
contact
with
the
outtime
trading
corporation
representative
zortan
brend
locally
known
as
brarnend
of
zorda
he
could
call
himself
brarnend
of
zortan
in
the
language
is
a
particularly
nasty
hadron
dalla
spent
a
few
weeks
at
his
residence
briefing
herself
on
local
conditions
then
she
went
to
the
capital
city
darsh
in
eastern
europe
and
enrolled
as
a
student
at
something
called
the
independent
institute
for
reincarnation
research
having
secured
a
letter
of
introduction
to
its
director
a
harnosh
of
hosh
almost
at
once
she
began
sending
in
reports
to
her
home
organization
the
rhogom
memorial
foundation
of
psychic
science
here
at
dhergabar
through
zortan
brend
the
people
there
were
wildly
enthusiastic
i
do
have
more
than
the
average
intelligent
i
hope
layman
knowledge
of
psychics
but
volzar
darv
the
director
of
rhogom
foundation
tells
me
that
even
in
the
present
incomplete
form
her
reports
have
opened
whole
new
horizons
in
the
science
it
seems
that
these
people
have
actually
demonstrated
as
a
scientific
fact
that
the
human
individuality
reincarnates
after
physical
death
that
your
personality
and
mine
have
existed
as
such
for
ages
and
will
exist
for
ages
to
come
more
they
have
means
of
recovering
from
almost
anybody
memories
of
past
reincarnations
illustration
well
after
about
a
month
the
people
at
this
reincarnation
institute
realized
that
this
dallona
of
hadron
was
any
ordinary
student
she
probably
had
trouble
keeping
down
to
the
local
level
of
psychic
knowledge
so
as
soon
as
she
learned
their
techniques
she
was
allowed
to
undertake
experimental
work
of
her
own
i
imagine
she
let
herself
out
on
that
as
soon
as
she
mastered
the
standard
methods
of
recovering
memories
of
past
reincarnations
she
began
refining
and
developing
them
more
than
the
local
yokels
had
been
able
to
do
in
the
past
thousand
years
i
ca
tell
you
just
what
she
did
because
i
do
know
the
subject
but
she
must
have
lit
things
up
properly
she
got
quite
a
lot
of
local
publicity
not
only
scientific
journals
but
general
newscasts
then
four
days
ago
she
disappeared
and
her
disappearance
seems
to
have
been
coincident
with
an
unsuccessful
attempt
on
her
life
we
do
know
as
much
about
this
as
we
should
all
we
have
is
zortan
brend
account
it
seems
that
on
the
evening
of
her
disappearance
she
had
been
attending
the
voluntary
discarnation
feast
suicide
party
of
a
prominent
nobleman
named
garnon
of
roxor
evidently
when
the
people
get
tired
of
their
current
reincarnation
they
invite
in
their
friends
throw
a
big
party
and
then
do
themselves
in
in
an
atmosphere
of
general
conviviality
frequently
they
take
poison
or
inhale
lethal
gas
this
fellow
had
his
personal
trigger
man
shoot
him
through
the
head
dalla
was
one
of
the
guests
of
honor
along
with
this
harnosh
of
hosh
they
made
rather
elaborate
preparations
and
after
the
shooting
they
got
a
detailed
and
apparently
authentic
from
the
late
garnon
the
voluntary
discarnation
was
just
a
routine
social
event
it
seems
but
the
communication
caused
quite
an
uproar
and
rated
top
place
on
the
newscasts
and
started
a
storm
of
controversy
after
the
shooting
and
the
communication
dalla
took
the
officiating
gun
artist
one
dirzed
into
her
own
service
this
dirzed
was
spoken
of
as
a
generally
respected
member
of
something
called
the
society
of
assassins
and
that
give
you
an
idea
of
what
things
are
like
on
that
sector
and
why
i
do
want
to
send
anybody
who
might
develop
cramp
at
the
wrong
moment
she
and
dirzed
left
the
home
of
the
gentleman
who
had
just
had
himself
discarnated
presumably
for
dalla
apartment
about
a
hundred
miles
away
that
the
last
been
heard
of
either
of
them
this
attempt
on
dalla
life
occurred
while
the
revels
were
still
going
on
she
lived
in
a
apartment
with
three
servants
on
one
of
the
upper
floors
of
a
tower
cities
are
built
vertically
with
considerable
interval
between
units
and
while
she
was
at
this
feast
a
package
was
delivered
at
the
apartment
ostensibly
from
the
reincarnation
institute
and
made
up
to
look
as
though
it
contained
record
tapes
one
of
the
servants
accepted
it
from
a
service
employee
of
the
apartments
the
next
morning
a
little
before
noon
harnosh
of
hosh
called
her
on
the
visiphone
and
got
no
answer
he
then
called
the
apartment
manager
who
entered
the
apartment
he
found
all
three
of
the
servants
dead
from
a
bomb
which
had
exploded
when
one
of
them
had
opened
this
package
however
hadron
dalla
had
never
returned
to
the
apartment
the
night
before
verkan
vall
was
sitting
motionless
his
face
expressionless
as
he
ran
tortha
karf
narrative
through
the
intricate
semantic
and
psychological
processes
of
the
first
level
mentality
the
fact
that
hadron
dalla
had
been
a
former
wife
of
his
had
been
relegated
to
one
corner
of
his
consciousness
and
contained
there
it
was
not
a
fact
that
would
at
the
moment
contribute
to
the
problem
or
to
his
treatment
of
it
the
package
was
delivered
while
she
was
at
this
suicide
party
he
considered
it
must
therefore
have
been
sent
by
somebody
who
either
did
not
know
she
would
be
out
of
the
apartment
or
who
did
not
expect
it
to
function
until
after
her
return
on
the
other
hand
if
her
disappearance
was
due
to
hostile
action
it
was
the
work
of
somebody
who
knew
she
was
at
the
feast
and
did
not
want
her
to
reach
her
apartment
again
this
would
seem
to
exclude
the
sender
of
the
package
bomb
tortha
karf
nodded
he
had
reached
that
conclusion
himself
thus
verkan
vall
continued
if
her
disappearance
was
the
work
of
an
enemy
she
must
have
two
enemies
each
working
in
ignorance
of
the
other
plans
what
do
you
think
she
did
to
provoke
such
enmity
well
of
course
it
just
might
be
that
dalla
normally
complicated
had
got
a
little
more
complicated
than
usual
and
on
her
verkan
vall
said
out
of
the
fullness
of
personal
knowledge
but
i
doubt
that
at
the
moment
i
would
think
that
this
affair
has
political
implications
so
tortha
karf
had
not
thought
of
politics
as
an
explanation
he
waited
for
verkan
vall
to
elaborate
do
you
see
chief
the
special
assistant
asked
we
find
a
belief
in
reincarnation
on
many
as
a
religious
doctrine
but
these
people
accept
it
as
a
scientific
fact
such
acceptance
would
carry
much
more
conviction
it
would
influence
a
people
entire
thinking
we
see
it
reflected
in
their
disregard
for
death
suicide
as
a
social
function
this
society
of
assassins
and
the
like
it
would
naturally
color
their
political
thinking
because
politics
is
nothing
but
common
action
to
secure
more
favorable
living
conditions
and
to
these
people
the
term
conditions
includes
not
only
the
present
life
but
also
an
indefinite
number
of
future
lives
as
well
i
find
this
title
institute
suggestive
independent
of
what
possibly
of
partisan
affiliation
but
would
these
people
be
grateful
to
her
for
her
new
discoveries
which
would
enable
them
to
plan
their
future
reincarnations
more
intelligently
tortha
karf
asked
oh
chief
verkan
vall
reproached
you
know
better
than
that
how
many
times
have
our
people
got
in
trouble
on
other
because
they
divulged
some
useful
scientific
fact
that
conflicted
with
the
locally
revered
nonsense
you
show
me
ten
men
who
cherish
some
religious
doctrine
or
political
ideology
and
i
show
you
nine
men
whose
minds
are
utterly
impervious
to
any
factual
evidence
which
contradicts
their
beliefs
and
who
regard
the
producer
of
such
evidence
as
a
criminal
who
ought
to
be
suppressed
for
instance
on
the
fourth
level
sector
where
i
was
just
working
there
is
a
political
sect
the
communists
who
in
the
territory
under
their
control
forbid
the
teaching
of
certain
facts
of
genetics
and
heredity
because
those
facts
do
not
fit
the
demanded
by
their
political
doctrines
and
on
the
same
sector
a
religious
sect
recently
tried
in
some
sections
successfully
to
outlaw
the
teaching
of
evolution
by
natural
selection
tortha
karf
nodded
i
remember
some
stories
my
grandfather
told
me
about
his
narrow
escapes
from
an
organization
called
the
holy
inquisition
when
he
was
a
paratime
trader
on
the
fourth
level
about
four
hundred
years
ago
i
believe
that
thing
still
operating
on
the
sector
under
the
name
of
the
nkvd
so
you
think
dalla
may
have
proven
something
that
conflicted
with
local
reincarnation
theories
and
somebody
who
had
a
vested
interest
in
maintaining
those
theories
is
trying
to
stop
her
you
spoke
of
a
controversy
over
the
communication
alleged
to
have
originated
with
this
voluntarily
discarnated
nobleman
that
would
suggest
a
difference
of
opinion
on
the
manner
of
nature
of
reincarnation
or
the
discarnate
state
this
difference
may
mark
the
dividing
line
between
the
different
political
parties
now
to
get
to
this
darsh
place
do
i
have
to
go
to
venus
as
dalla
did
no
the
outtime
trading
corporation
has
transposition
facilities
at
ravvanan
on
the
nile
which
is
spatially
with
the
city
of
ghamma
on
the
sector
where
zortan
brend
is
you
transpose
through
there
and
zortan
brend
will
furnish
you
transportation
to
darsh
it
take
you
about
two
days
here
getting
your
indoctrinations
and
having
your
skin
pigmented
and
your
hair
turned
black
i
notify
zortan
brend
at
once
that
you
coming
through
is
there
anything
special
you
want
why
i
want
an
abstract
of
the
reports
dalla
sent
back
to
rhogom
foundation
it
likely
that
there
is
some
clue
among
them
as
to
whom
her
discoveries
may
have
antagonized
i
going
to
be
a
venusian
a
friend
of
her
father
i
want
full
indoctrination
to
enable
me
to
play
that
part
and
i
want
to
familiarize
myself
with
weapons
and
combat
techniques
i
think
that
will
be
all

the

of

of

set
in

between

each
of

stood
in

some
five
miles
square
no

was
much
more

less

twenty
miles
from

of

crisscrossed
with

dotted

there
with

his
eyes
and
in
his
subconscious
mind
instantly
available
to
consciousness
was
a
vast
body
of
knowledge
about
conditions
on
the
sector
as
well
as
a
complete
command
of
the
local
language
all
hypnotically
acquired
he
knew
that
he
was
looking
down
upon
one
of
the
minor
provincial
cities
of
a
very
respectably
advanced
civilization
a
civilization
which
built
its
cities
vertically
since
it
had
learned
to
counteract
gravitation
a
civilization
which
still
depended
upon
natural
cereals
for
food
but
one
which
had
learned
to
make
the
most
efficient
use
of
its
soil
the
network
of
dams
and
irrigation
canals
which
he
saw
was
as
good
as
anything
on
his
own
paratime
level
the
wide
dispersal
of
buildings
he
knew
was
a
heritage
of
a
series
of
disastrous
atomic
wars
of
several
thousand
years
before
the
people
had
come
to
love
the
wide
of
open
country
and
forest
and
had
continued
to
scatter
their
buildings
even
after
the
necessity
had
passed
but
the
slim
towering
buildings
could
only
have
been
reared
by
a
people
who
had
banished
nationalism
and
with
it
the
threat
of
total
war
he
contrasted
them
with
the
dome
cities
of
the
khiftan
civilization
only
a
few
thousand
parayears
distant
three
men
came
out
of
the
lounge
behind
him
and
joined
him
one
was
like
himself
a
disguised
paratimer
from
the
first
level
the
outtime
export
and
import
man
zortan
brend
here
known
as
brarnend
of
zorda
the
other
two
were
people
and
both
wore
the
black
tunics
and
the
badges
of
the
society
of
assassins
unlike
verkan
vall
and
zortan
brend
who
wore
shoulder
holsters
under
their
short
tunics
the
assassins
openly
displayed
pistols
and
knives
on
their
belts
we
heard
that
you
were
coming
two
days
ago
lord
virzal
zortan
brend
said
we
delayed
the
of
this
ship
so
that
you
could
travel
to
darsh
as
inconspicuously
as
possible
i
also
booked
a
suite
for
you
at
the
solar
hotel
at
darsh
and
these
are
your
assassins
olirzon
and
marnik
verkan
vall
hooked
fingers
and
clapped
shoulders
with
them
virzal
of
verkan
he
identified
himself
i
am
satisfied
to
intrust
myself
to
you
we
do
our
best
for
you
lord
virzal
the
older
of
the
pair
olirzon
said
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
continued
understand
lord
virzal
i
only
ask
for
information
useful
in
serving
and
protecting
you
but
is
this
of
the
lady
dallona
a
political
matter
not
from
our
side
verkan
vall
told
him
the
lady
dallona
is
a
scientist
entirely
nonpolitical
the
honorable
brarnend
is
a
business
man
he
does
meddle
with
politics
as
long
as
the
politicians
leave
him
alone
and
i
a
planter
on
venus
i
have
enough
troubles
with
the
natives
and
the
weather
and
in
the
plants
and
poison
roaches
and
javelin
bugs
without
getting
into
politics
but
psychic
science
is
inextricably
mixed
with
politics
and
the
lady
dallona
work
had
evidently
tended
to
discredit
the
theory
of
statistical
reincarnation
do
you
often
make
understatements
like
that
lord
virzal
olirzon
grinned
in
the
last
six
months
she
knocked
statistical
reincarnation
to
splinters
well
i
not
a
psychic
scientist
and
as
i
said
i
do
know
much
about
terran
politics
verkan
vall
replied
i
know
that
the
statisticalists
favor
complete
socialization
and
political
control
of
the
whole
economy
because
they
want
everybody
to
have
the
same
opportunities
in
every
reincarnation
and
the
volitionalists
believe
that
everybody
reincarnates
as
he
pleases
and
so
they
favor
continuance
of
the
present
system
of
private
ownership
of
wealth
and
private
profit
under
a
system
of
free
competition
and
that
about
all
i
do
know
naturally
as
a
and
the
holder
of
a
title
of
nobility
i
a
volitionalist
in
politics
but
the
socialization
issue
is
important
on
venus
there
is
still
too
much
unseated
land
there
and
too
many
personal
opportunities
to
make
socialism
attractive
to
anybody
well
that
about
it
zortan
brend
told
him
i
not
enough
of
a
psychicist
to
know
what
the
lady
dallona
been
doing
but
knocked
the
theoretical
basis
from
under
statistical
reincarnation
and
that
the
basis
in
turn
of
statistical
socialism
i
think
find
that
the
statisticalist
party
is
responsible
for
whatever
happened
to
her
marnik
the
younger
of
the
two
assassins
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
addressed
verkan
vall
lord
virzal
i
know
none
of
the
personalities
involved
in
this
matter
and
i
speak
without
wishing
to
give
offense
but
is
it
not
possible
that
the
lady
dallona
and
the
assassin
dirzed
may
have
gone
somewhere
together
voluntarily
i
have
met
dirzed
and
he
has
many
qualities
which
women
find
attractive
and
he
is
by
no
means
indifferent
to
the
opposite
sex
you
understand
lord
virzal
i
understand
all
too
perfectly
marnik
verkan
vall
replied
out
of
the
fullness
of
experience
the
lady
dallona
has
had
affairs
with
a
number
of
men
myself
among
them
but
under
the
circumstances
i
find
that
explanation
unthinkable
marnik
looked
at
him
in
open
skepticism
evidently
in
his
book
where
an
attractive
man
and
a
beautiful
woman
were
concerned
that
explanation
was
never
unthinkable
the
lady
dallona
is
a
scientist
verkan
vall
elaborated
she
is
not
above
diverting
herself
with
love
affairs
but
that
all
they
are
a
not
too
important
form
of
diversion
and
if
you
recall
she
had
just
participated
in
a
most
significant
experiment
you
can
be
sure
that
she
had
other
things
on
her
mind
at
the
time
than
pleasure
jaunts
with
assassins
the
ship
was
passing
around
the
caucasus
mountains
with
the
caspian
sea
in
sight
ahead
when
several
of
the
crew
appeared
on
the
observation
deck
and
began
preparing
the
shielding
to
protect
the
deck
from
gunfire
zortan
brend
inquired
of
the
petty
officer
in
charge
of
the
work
as
to
the
necessity
we
been
getting
reports
of
trouble
at
darsh
sir
the
man
said
newscast
bulletins
every
couple
of
minutes
rioting
in
different
parts
of
the
city
started
yesterday
afternoon
when
a
couple
of
statisticalist
members
of
the
executive
council
resigned
and
went
over
to
the
volitionalists
lord
nirzav
of
shonna
the
only
nobleman
of
any
importance
in
the
statisticalist
party
was
one
of
them
he
was
shot
immediately
afterward
while
leaving
the
council
chambers
along
with
a
couple
of
assassins
who
were
with
him
some
people
in
an
airboat
sprayed
them
with
a
machine
rifle
as
they
came
out
onto
the
landing
stage
the
two
assassins
exclaimed
in
horrified
anger
over
this
that
was
the
work
of
members
of
the
society
of
assassins
olirzon
declared
even
after
he
resigned
the
lord
nirzav
was
still
immune
till
he
left
the
government
building
there
too
blasted
much
illegal
assassination
going
on
what
happened
next
verkan
vall
wanted
to
know
about
what
you
expect
sir
the
volitionalists
were
going
to
take
that
quietly
in
the
past
eighteen
hours
four
prominent
statisticalists
were
forcibly
discarnated
and
there
was
even
a
fight
in
mirzark
of
bashad
house
when
volitionalist
assassins
broke
in
three
of
them
and
four
of
mirzark
assassins
were
discarnated
you
know
something
is
going
to
have
to
be
done
about
that
too
olirzon
said
to
marnik
it
getting
to
a
point
where
these
political
faction
fights
are
being
carried
on
entirely
between
members
of
the
society
in
ghamma
alone
last
year
thirty
or
forty
of
our
members
were
discarnated
that
way
plug
in
a
newscast
visiplate
karnil
zortan
brend
told
the
petty
officer
let
see
what
going
on
in
darsh
now
in
darsh
it
seemed
an
uneasy
peace
was
being
established
verkan
vall
watched
airboats
and
light
combat
ships
patrolling
among
the
high
towers
of
the
city
he
saw
a
couple
of
minor
riots
being
broken
up
by
the
constabulary
with
considerable
shooting
and
a
ruthless
disregard
for
who
might
get
shot
it
exactly
the
sort
of
policing
that
would
have
been
tolerated
in
the
first
level
civil
order
section
but
it
seemed
to
suit
conditions
and
he
listened
to
a
series
of
angry
recriminations
and
contradictory
statements
by
different
politicians
all
of
whom
blamed
the
disorders
on
their
opponents
the
volitionalists
spoke
of
the
statisticalists
as
insane
criminals
and
underminers
of
social
stability
and
the
statisticalists
called
the
volitionalists
reactionary
criminals
and
enemies
of
social
progress
politicians
he
had
observed
differed
little
in
their
vocabularies
from
one
to
another
this
kept
up
all
the
while
the
ship
was
passing
over
the
caspian
sea
as
they
were
turning
up
the
volga
valley
one
of
the
ship
officers
came
down
from
the
control
deck
above
we
coming
into
darsh
now
he
said
and
as
verkan
vall
turned
from
the
visiplate
to
the
forward
windows
he
could
see
the
white
and
towers
of
the
city
rising
above
the
hardwood
forests
that
covered
the
whole
volga
basin
on
this
sector
your
luggage
has
been
put
into
the
airboat
lord
virzal
and
honorable
assassins
and
it
ready
for
launching
whenever
you
are
the
officer
glanced
at
his
watch
we
dock
at
commercial
center
in
twenty
minutes
we
be
passing
the
solar
hotel
in
ten
they
all
rose
and
verkan
vall
hooked
fingers
and
clapped
shoulders
with
zortan
brend
good
luck
lord
virzal
the
latter
said
i
hope
you
find
the
lady
dallona
safe
and
carnate
if
you
need
help
i
be
at
mercantile
house
for
the
next
day
or
so
if
you
get
back
to
ghamma
before
i
do
you
know
who
to
ask
for
there
a
number
of
assassins
loitered
in
the
hallways
and
offices
of
the
independent
institute
of
reincarnation
research
when
verkan
vall
accompanied
by
marnik
called
there
that
afternoon
some
of
them
carried
or
projectors
and
they
were
stopping
people
and
questioning
them
marnik
needed
only
to
give
them
a
quick
gesture
and
the
words
assassins
truce
and
he
and
his
client
were
allowed
to
pass
they
entered
a
lifter
tube
and
floated
up
to
the
office
of
harnosh
of
hosh
with
whom
verkan
vall
had
made
an
appointment
i
sorry
lord
virzal
the
director
of
the
institute
told
him
but
i
have
no
idea
what
has
befallen
the
lady
dallona
or
even
if
she
is
still
carnate
i
am
quite
worried
i
admired
her
extremely
both
as
an
individual
and
as
a
scientist
i
do
hope
she
has
been
discarnated
that
would
be
a
serious
blow
to
science
it
is
fortunate
that
she
accomplished
as
much
as
she
did
while
she
was
with
us
you
think
she
is
no
longer
carnate
then
i
afraid
so
the
political
effects
of
her
discoveries
harnosh
of
hosh
shrugged
sadly
she
was
devoted
to
a
rare
degree
to
her
work
i
am
sure
that
nothing
but
her
discarnation
could
have
taken
her
away
from
us
at
this
time
with
so
many
important
experiments
still
uncompleted
marnik
nodded
to
verkan
vall
as
much
as
to
say
you
were
right
well
i
intend
acting
upon
the
assumption
that
she
is
still
carnate
and
in
need
of
help
until
i
am
positive
to
the
contrary
verkan
vall
said
and
in
the
latter
case
i
intend
finding
out
who
discarnated
her
and
send
him
to
apologize
for
it
in
person
people
do
forcibly
discarnate
my
friends
with
impunity
sound
attitude
harnosh
commented
there
certainly
no
positive
evidence
that
she
is
still
carnate
i
gladly
give
you
all
the
assistance
i
can
if
you
only
tell
me
what
you
want
well
in
the
first
place
verkan
vall
began
just
what
sort
of
work
was
she
doing
he
already
knew
the
answer
to
that
from
the
reports
she
had
sent
back
to
the
first
level
but
he
wanted
to
hear
harnosh
version
and
what
exactly
are
the
political
effects
you
mentioned
understand
harnosh
i
am
really
quite
ignorant
of
any
scientific
subject
unrelated
to
culture
and
equally
so
of
terran
politics
politics
on
venus
is
mainly
a
question
of
who
gets
how
much
graft
out
of
what
harnosh
smiled
evidently
he
had
heard
about
venusian
politics
ah
yes
of
course
but
you
are
familiar
with
the
main
differences
between
statistical
and
volitional
reincarnation
theories
illustration
in
a
general
way
the
volitionalists
hold
that
the
discarnate
individuality
is
fully
conscious
and
is
capable
of
something
analogous
to
and
is
also
capable
of
exercising
choice
in
the
matter
of
reincarnation
vehicles
and
can
reincarnate
or
remain
in
the
discarnate
state
as
it
chooses
they
also
believe
that
discarnate
individualities
can
communicate
with
one
another
and
with
at
least
some
carnate
individualities
by
telepathy
he
said
the
statisticalists
deny
all
this
their
opinion
is
that
the
discarnate
individuality
is
in
a
more
or
less
somnambulistic
state
that
it
is
drawn
by
a
process
akin
to
tropism
to
the
nearest
available
reincarnation
vehicle
and
that
it
must
reincarnate
in
and
only
in
that
vehicle
they
are
labeled
statisticalists
because
they
believe
that
the
process
of
reincarnation
is
purely
at
random
or
governed
by
unknown
and
uncontrollable
causes
and
is
unpredictable
except
as
to
aggregates
that
a
fairly
good
generalized
summary
harnosh
of
hosh
grudged
unwilling
to
give
a
mere
layman
too
much
credit
he
dipped
a
spoon
into
a
tobacco
humidor
dusted
the
tobacco
lightly
with
dried
and
rammed
it
into
his
pipe
you
must
understand
that
our
modern
statisticalists
are
the
intellectual
heirs
of
those
ancient
materialistic
thinkers
who
denied
the
possibility
of
any
discarnate
existence
or
of
any
extraphysical
mind
or
even
of
extrasensory
perception
since
all
these
things
have
been
demonstrated
to
be
facts
the
materialistic
dogma
has
been
broadened
to
include
them
but
always
strictly
within
the
frame
of
materialism
we
have
proven
for
instance
that
the
human
individuality
can
exist
in
a
discarnate
state
and
that
it
reincarnates
into
the
body
of
an
infant
shortly
after
birth
but
the
statisticalists
can
not
accept
the
idea
of
discarnate
consciousness
since
they
conceive
of
consciousness
purely
as
a
function
of
the
physical
brain
so
they
postulate
an
unconscious
discarnate
personality
or
as
you
put
it
one
in
a
somnambulistic
state
they
have
to
concede
memory
to
this
discarnate
personality
since
it
was
by
recovery
of
memories
of
previous
reincarnations
that
discarnate
existence
and
reincarnation
were
proven
to
be
facts
so
they
picture
the
discarnate
individuality
as
a
material
object
or
physical
event
of
negligible
but
actual
mass
in
which
an
indefinite
number
of
memories
can
be
stored
as
electronic
charges
and
they
picture
it
as
being
drawn
irresistibly
to
the
body
of
the
nearest
infant
curiously
enough
the
reincarnation
vehicle
chosen
is
almost
always
of
the
same
sex
as
the
vehicle
of
the
previous
reincarnation
the
exceptions
being
cases
of
persons
who
had
a
previous
history
of
psychological
harnosh
remembered
the
unlighted
pipe
in
his
hand
thrust
it
into
his
mouth
and
lit
it
for
a
moment
he
sat
with
it
jutting
out
of
his
black
beard
until
it
was
drawing
to
his
satisfaction
this
belief
in
immediate
reincarnation
leads
the
statisticalists
when
they
fight
duels
or
perform
voluntary
discarnation
to
do
so
in
the
neighborhood
of
maternity
hospitals
he
added
i
know
personally
of
one
reincarnation
in
which
the
subject
a
statisticalist
voluntarily
discarnated
by
inhaler
in
a
private
room
at
one
of
our
local
maternity
hospitals
and
reincarnated
twenty
years
later
in
the
city
of
jeddul
three
thousand
miles
away
the
square
black
beard
jiggled
as
the
scientist
laughed
now
as
to
the
political
implications
of
these
contradictory
theories
since
the
statisticalists
believe
that
they
will
reincarnate
entirely
at
random
their
aim
is
to
create
an
utterly
classless
social
and
economic
order
in
which
theoretically
each
individuality
will
reincarnate
into
a
condition
of
equality
with
everybody
else
their
political
program
therefore
is
one
of
complete
socialization
of
all
means
of
production
and
distribution
abolition
of
hereditary
titles
and
inherited
wealth
eventually
all
private
wealth
and
total
government
control
of
all
economic
social
and
cultural
activities
of
course
harnosh
apologized
politics
is
my
subject
i
would
presume
to
judge
how
that
would
function
in
practice
i
would

vall
said
shortly
thinking
of
all
the
different
on
which
he
had
seen
systems
like
that
in
operation
you
would
like
it
doctor
and
the
volitionalists
well
since
they
believe
that
they
are
able
to
choose
the
circumstances
of
their
next
reincarnations
for
themselves
they
are
the
party
of
the
naturally
almost
all
the
nobles
almost
all
the
wealthy
trading
and
manufacturing
families
and
almost
all
professional
people
are
volitionalists
most
of
the
workers
and
peasants
are
statisticalists
or
at
least
they
were
for
the
most
part
before
we
began
announcing
the
results
of
the
lady
experimental
work
ah
now
we
come
to
it
verkan
vall
said
as
the
story
clarified
yes
in
somewhat
oversimplified
form
the
situation
is
rather
like
this
harnosh
of
hosh
said
the
lady
dallona
introduced
a
number
of
refinements
and
some
outright
innovations
into
our
technique
of
recovering
memories
of
past
reincarnations
previously
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
subject
in
an
hypnotic
trance
during
which
he
or
she
would
narrate
what
was
remembered
of
past
reincarnations
and
this
would
be
recorded
on
emerging
from
the
trance
the
subject
would
remember
nothing
the
would
be
all
that
would
be
left
but
the
lady
dallona
devised
a
technique
by
which
these
memories
would
remain
in
what
might
be
called
the
fore
part
of
the
subconscious
mind
so
that
they
could
be
brought
to
the
level
of
consciousness
at
will
more
she
was
able
to
recover
memories
of
past
discarnate
existences
something
we
had
never
been
able
to
do
heretofore
harnosh
shook
his
head
and
to
think
when
i
first
met
her
i
thought
that
she
was
just
another
young
lady
of
wealth
and
was
almost
about
to
refuse
her
enrollment
he
was
the
only
one
whom
little
dalla
had
surprised
verkan
vall
thought
at
least
he
had
been
pleasantly
surprised
you
see
this
entirely
disproves
the
statistical
theory
of
reincarnation
for
example
we
got
a
fine
set
of
from
one
subject
for
four
previous
reincarnations
and
four
intercarnations
in
the
first
of
these
the
subject
had
been
a
peasant
on
the
estate
of
a
wealthy
noble
unlike
most
of
his
fellows
who
reincarnated
into
other
peasant
families
almost
immediately
after
discarnation
this
man
waited
for
fifty
years
in
the
discarnate
state
for
an
opportunity
to
reincarnate
as
the
son
of
an
in
his
next
reincarnation
he
was
the
son
of
a
technician
and
received
a
technical
education
he
became
a
physics
researcher
for
his
next
reincarnation
he
chose
the
son
of
a
nobleman
by
a
concubine
as
his
vehicle
in
his
present
reincarnation
he
is
a
member
of
a
wealthy
manufacturing
family
and
married
into
a
family
of
the
nobility
in
five
reincarnations
he
has
climbed
from
the
lowest
to
the
rung
of
the
social
ladder
few
individuals
of
the
class
from
whence
he
began
this
ascent
possess
so
much
persistence
or
determination
then
of
course
there
was
the
case
of
lord
garnon
of
roxor
he
went
on
to
describe
the
last
experiment
in
which
hadron
dalla
had
participated
well
that
all
sounds
pretty
conclusive
verkan
vall
commented
i
take
it
the
leaders
of
the
volitionalist
party
here
are
pleased
with
the
result
of
the
lady
dallona
work
pleased
my
dear
lord
virzal
they
fairly
bursting
with
glee
over
it
harnosh
of
hosh
declared
as
i
pointed
out
the
statisticalist
program
of
socialization
is
based
entirely
on
the
proposition
that
no
one
can
choose
the
circumstances
of
his
next
reincarnation
and
been
demonstrated
to
be
utter
nonsense
until
the
lady
discoveries
were
announced
they
were
the
dominant
party
controlling
a
majority
of
the
seats
in
parliament
and
on
the
executive
council
only
the
constitution
kept
them
from
enacting
their
entire
socialization
program
long
ago
and
they
were
about
to
legislate
constitutional
changes
which
would
remove
that
barrier
they
had
expected
to
be
able
to
do
so
after
the
forthcoming
general
elections
but
now
social
inequality
has
become
desirable
it
gives
people
something
to
look
forward
to
in
the
next
reincarnation
instead
of
wanting
to
abolish
wealth
and
privilege
and
nobility
the
proletariat
want
to
reincarnate
into
them
harnosh
of
hosh
laughed
happily
so
you
can
see
how
furious
the
statisticalist
party
organization
is
there
a
catch
to
this
somewhere
marnik
the
assassin
speaking
for
the
first
time
declared
they
ca
all
reincarnate
as
princes
there
are
enough
vacancies
to
go
and
no
noble
is
going
to
reincarnate
as
a
tractor
driver
to
make
room
for
a
tractor
driver
who
wants
to
reincarnate
as
a
noble
that
correct
harnosh
replied
there
is
a
catch
to
it
a
catch
most
people
would
never
admit
even
to
themselves
very
few
individuals
possess
the
will
power
the
intelligence
or
the
capacity
for
mental
effort
displayed
by
the
subject
of
the
case
i
just
quoted
the
average
man
interests
are
almost
entirely
on
the
physical
side
he
actually
finds
mental
effort
painful
and
makes
as
little
of
it
as
possible
and
that
is
the
only
sort
of
effort
a
discarnate
individuality
can
exert
so
unable
to
endure
the
fifty
or
so
years
needed
to
make
a
really
good
reincarnation
he
reincarnates
in
a
year
or
so
out
of
pure
boredom
into
the
first
vehicle
he
can
find
usually
one
nobody
else
wants
harnosh
dug
out
the
heel
of
his
pipe
and
blew
through
the
stem
but
nobody
will
admit
his
own
mental
inferiority
even
to
himself
now
every
machine
operator
and
field
hand
on
the
planet
thinks
he
can
reincarnate
as
a
prince
or
a
millionaire
politics
is
my
subject
but
i
willing
to
bet
that
since
statistical
reincarnation
is
an
exploded
psychic
theory
statisticalist
socialism
has
been
caught
in
the
blast
area
and
destroyed
along
with
it
olirzon
was
in
the
drawing
room
of
the
hotel
suite
when
they
returned
sitting
on
the
middle
of
his
spinal
column
in
a
reclining
chair
smoking
a
pipe
dressing
the
edge
of
his
knife
with
a
and
gazing
lecherously
at
a
young
woman
in
the
visiplate
she
was
an
extremely
young
woman
in
a
rather
fragmentary
costume
and
she
was
heaving
her
bosom
at
the
invisible
audience
in
anger
sorrow
scorn
entreaty
and
numerous
other
emotions
this
revolting
crime
she
was
declaiming
in
a
husky
contralto
as
verkan
vall
and
marnik
entered
foul
even
for
the
criminal
beasts
who
conceived
and
perpetrated
it
she
pointed
an
accusing
finger
this
murder
of
the
beautiful
lady
dallona
of
hadron
verkan
vall
stopped
short
considering
the
possibility
of
something
having
been
discovered
lately
of
which
he
was
ignorant
olirzon
must
have
guessed
his
thought
he
grinned
reassuringly
think
nothing
of
it
lord
virzal
he
said
waving
his
knife
at
the
visiplate
just
political
propaganda
strictly
for
the
sparrows
nice
propagandist
though
and
now
the
woman
with
the
magnificent
natural
resources
lowered
her
voice
reverently
we
bring
you
the
last
image
of
the
lady
dallona
and
of
dirzed
her
faithful
assassin
taken
just
before
they
vanished
never
to
be
seen
again
the
plate
darkened
and
there
were
strains
of
slow
dirgelike
music
then
it
lighted
again
presenting
a
view
of
a
broad
hallway
thronged
with
men
and
women
in
bright
varicolored
costumes
in
the
foreground
wearing
a
tight
skirt
of
deep
blue
and
a
short
red
jacket
was
hadron
dalla
just
as
she
had
looked
in
the
solidographs
taken
in
dhergabar
after
her
alteration
by
the
first
level
cosmeticians
to
conform
to
the
appearance
of
the
malayoid
people
she
was
holding
the
arm
of
a
man
who
wore
the
black
tunic
and
red
badge
of
an
assassin
a
handsome
specimen
of
the
race
trust
little
dalla
for
that
verkan
vall
thought
the
figures
were
moving
with
exaggerated
slowness
as
though
a
very
fleeting
picture
were
being
stretched
out
as
far
as
possible
having
already
memorized
his
former
wife
changed
appearance
verkan
vall
concentrated
on
the
man
beside
her
until
the
picture
faded
all
right
olirzon
what
did
you
get
he
asked
well
first
of
all
at
assassins
hall
olirzon
said
rolling
up
his
left
sleeve
holding
his
bare
forearm
to
the
light
and
shaving
a
few
fine
hairs
from
it
to
test
the
edge
of
his
knife
of
course
they
never
tell
one
assassin
anything
about
the
client
of
another
assassin
that
standard
practice
but
i
was
in
the
lodge
secretary
office
where
nobody
but
assassins
are
ever
admitted
they
have
a
big
panel
in
there
with
the
names
of
all
the
lodge
members
on
it
in
that
standard
in
all
lodges
if
an
assassin
is
unattached
and
free
to
accept
a
client
his
name
in
white
light
if
he
has
a
client
the
light
changed
to
blue
and
the
name
of
the
client
goes
up
under
his
if
his
whereabouts
are
unknown
the
light
changed
to
amber
if
he
is
discarnated
his
name
removed
entirely
unless
the
circumstances
of
his
discarnation
are
such
as
to
constitute
an
injury
to
the
society
in
that
case
the
name
in
red
light
until
he
been
properly
avenged
or
as
we
say
till
his
blood
been
mopped
up
well
the
name
of
dirzed
is
up
in
blue
light
with
the
name
of
dallona
of
hadron
under
it
i
found
out
that
the
light
had
been
amber
for
two
days
after
the
disappearance
and
then
had
been
changed
back
to
blue
get
it
lord
virzal
verkan
vall
nodded
i
think
so
i
been
considering
that
as
a
possibility
from
the
first
then
what
then
i
was
about
and
around
for
a
couple
of
hours
buying
drinks
for
people
unattached
assassins
constabulary
detectives
political
workers
newscast
people
you
owe
me
fifteen
system
monetary
units
for
that
lord
virzal
what
i
got
when
it
all
sorted
out
i
taped
it
in
detail
as
soon
as
i
got
back
reduces
to
this
the
volitionalists
are
moving
mountains
to
find
out
who
was
the
spy
at
garnon
of
discarnation
feast
but
are
doing
nothing
but
nothing
at
all
to
find
the
lady
dallona
or
dirzed
the
statisticalists
are
making
all
sorts
of
secret
efforts
to
find
out
what
happened
to
her
the
constabulary
blame
the
statistos
for
the
they
interested
in
that
because
of
the
discarnation
of
the
three
servants
by
an
illegal
weapon
of
indiscriminate
effect
they
claim
that
the
disappearance
of
dirzed
and
the
lady
dallona
was
a
publicity
hoax
the
volitionalists
are
preparing
a
line
of
publicity
to
deny
this
verkan
vall
nodded
that
ties
in
with
what
you
learned
at
hall
he
said
they
hiding
out
somewhere
is
there
any
chance
of
reaching
dirzed
through
the
society
of
assassins
olirzon
shook
his
head
if
you
right
and
that
the
way
it
looks
to
me
too
he
probably
just
called
in
and
notified
the
society
that
he
still
carnate
and
so
is
the
lady
dallona
and
called
off
any
search
the
society
might
be
making
for
him
and
i
got
to
find
the
lady
dallona
as
soon
as
i
can
well
if
i
ca
reach
her
maybe
i
can
get
her
to
send
word
to
me
verkan
vall
said
that
going
to
take
some
doing
too
what
did
you
find
out
lord
virzal
olirzon
asked
he
had
a
piece
of
soft
leather
now
and
was
polishing
his
blade
lovingly
the
reincarnation
research
people
do
know
anything
verkan
vall
replied
harnosh
of
hosh
thinks
she
discarnate
i
did
find
out
that
the
experimental
work
she
done
so
far
has
absolutely
disproved
the
theory
of
statistical
reincarnation
the
theory
is
solidly
established
yes
what
do
you
think
olirzon
marnik
added
they
have
a
case
on
record
of
a
man
who
worked
up
from
field
hand
to
millionaire
in
five
reincarnations
deliberately
that
is
he
went
on
to
repeat
what
harnosh
of
hosh
had
said
he
must
have
possessed
an
almost
eidetic
memory
for
he
gave
the
bearded
psychicist
words
verbatim
and
threw
in
the
gestures
and
olirzon
grinned
you
know
there
a
chance
for
the
boys
he
considered
too
can
reincarnate
as
a
millionaire
let
nirzutz
of
futzbutz
help
you
only
system
monetary
units
for
the
secret
infallible
autosuggestive
formula
and
would
it
sell
he
put
away
the
hone
and
the
bit
of
leather
and
slipped
his
knife
back
into
its
sheath
if
i
were
a
respectable
assassin
i
give
it
a
try
myself
verkan
vall
looked
at
his
watch
we
better
get
something
to
eat
he
said
we
go
down
to
the
main
dining
room
the
martian
room
i
think
they
call
it
i
got
to
think
of
some
way
to
let
the
lady
dallona
know
i
looking
for
her
the
martian
room
fifteen
stories
down
was
a
big
place
occupying
almost
half
of
the
floor
space
of
one
corner
tower
it
had
been
fitted
to
resemble
one
of
the
ruined
buildings
of
the
ancient
and
vanished
race
of
mars
who
were
the
ancestors
of
terran
humanity
one
whole
side
of
the
room
was
a
gigantic
screen
on
which
the
gullied
desolation
of
a
martian
landscape
was
projected
in
the
course
of
about
two
hours
the
scene
changed
from
sunrise
through
daylight
and
night
to
sunrise
again
it
was
high
noon
when
they
entered
and
found
a
table
by
the
time
they
had
finished
their
dinner
the
night
was
ending
and
the
first
glow
of
dawn
was
tinting
the
distant
hills
they
sat
for
a
while
watching
the
light
grow
stronger
then
got
up
and
left
the
table
there
were
five
men
at
a
table
near
them
they
had
come
in
before
the
stars
had
grown
dim
and
the
waiters
were
just
bringing
their
first
dishes
two
were
assassins
and
the
other
three
were
of
a
breed
verkan
vall
had
learned
to
recognize
on
any
the
arrogant
cocksure
ambitious
leftist
politician
who
knows
what
is
best
for
everybody
better
than
anybody
else
does
and
who
is
convinced
that
he
is
inescapably
right
and
that
whoever
differs
with
him
is
not
only
an
ignoramus
but
a
venal
scoundrel
as
well
one
was
a
beefy
man
in
a
dress
tunic
he
had
thick
lips
and
a
laugh
another
was
a
rather
young
man
who
spoke
earnestly
and
rolled
his
eyes
upward
as
though
at
some
celestial
vision
the
third
had
the
faint
powdering
of
gray
in
his
black
hair
which
was
among
the
people
almost
the
only
indication
of
advanced
age
of
course
it
is
the
whole
thing
is
a
fraud
the
monkish
young
man
was
saying
angrily
but
we
ca
prove
it
oh
sirzob
here
can
prove
anything
if
you
give
him
time
the
beefy
one
laughed
the
trouble
is
there
is
too
much
time
we
know
that
that
communication
was
a
fake
prearranged
by
the
volitionalists
with
harnosh
and
this
dallona
of
hadron
as
their
tools
they
fed
the
whole
thing
to
that
idiot
boy
hypnotically
in
advance
and
then
on
a
signal
he
began
typing
out
this
spurious
communication
and
then
of
course
dallona
and
this
assassin
of
hers
ran
off
somewhere
together
so
that
we
be
blamed
with
discarnating
or
abducting
them
and
so
that
they
would
be
made
to
testify
about
the
communication
on
a
lie
detector
a
sudden
happy
smile
touched
verkan
vall
eyes
he
caught
each
of
his
assassins
by
an
arm
marnik
cover
my
back
he
ordered
olirzon
cover
everybody
at
the
table
come
on
then
he
stepped
forward
halting
between
the
chairs
of
the
young
man
and
the
man
with
the
gray
hair
and
facing
the
beefy
man
in
the
light
tunic
you
he
barked
i
mean
you
the
beefy
man
stopped
laughing
and
stared
at
him
then
sprang
to
his
feet
his
hand
streaking
toward
his
left
armpit
stopped
and
dropped
to
his
side
as
olirzon
aimed
a
pistol
at
him
the
others
sat
motionless
you
verkan
vall
continued
are
a
complete
deliberate
malicious
and
unmitigated
liar
the
lady
dallona
of
hadron
is
a
scientist
of
integrity
incapable
of
falsifying
her
experimental
work
what
more
her
father
is
one
of
my
best
friends
in
his
name
and
in
hers
i
demand
a
full
retraction
of
the
slanderous
statements
you
have
just
made
do
you
know
who
i
am
the
beefy
one
shouted
i
know
you
are
verkan
vall
shouted
back
like
most
ancient
languages
the
speech
included
an
elaborate
and
utterly
vile
vocabulary
of
abuse
verkan
vall
culled
from
it
judiciously
and
at
length
and
if
i
do
make
myself
understood
verbally
we
go
down
to
the
object
level
he
added
snatching
a
bowl
of
soup
from
in
front
of
the
young
man
and
throwing
it
across
the
table
the
soup
was
a
dark
brown
almost
black
it
contained
bits
of
meat
and
mushrooms
and
slices
of
egg
and
yellow
martian
rock
lichen
it
produced
on
the
light
tunic
a
most
spectacular
effect
for
a
moment
verkan
vall
was
afraid
the
fellow
would
have
an
apoplectic
stroke
or
an
epileptic
fit
mastering
himself
however
he
bowed
jerkily
marnark
of
bashad
he
identified
himself
when
and
where
can
my
friends
consult
yours
lord
virzal
of
verkan
the
paratimer
bowed
back
your
friends
can
negotiate
with
mine
here
and
now
i
am
represented
by
these
i
wo
submit
my
friends
to
the
indignity
of
negotiating
with
them
marnark
retorted
i
insist
that
you
be
represented
by
persons
of
your
own
quality
and
mine
oh
you
do
olirzon
broke
in
well
is
your
objection
personal
to
me
or
to
assassins
as
a
class
in
the
first
case
i
remember
to
make
a
private
project
of
you
as
soon
as
i
through
with
my
present
employment
if
it
the
latter
i
report
your
attitude
to
the
society
i
see
what
klarnood
our
thinks
of
your
views
a
crowd
had
begun
to
accumulate
around
the
table
some
of
them
were
persons
in
evening
dress
some
were
assassins
on
the
hotel
payroll
and
some
were
unattached
assassins
well
you
wo
have
far
to
look
for
him
one
of
the
latter
said
pushing
through
the
crowd
to
the
table
he
was
a
man
of
middle
age
inclined
to
stoutness
he
made
verkan
vall
think
of
a
chocolate
figure
of
tortha
karf
the
red
badge
on
his
breast
was
surrounded
with
gold
lace
and
instead
of
black
wings
and
a
silver
bullet
it
bore
silver
wings
and
a
golden
dagger
he
bowed
contemptuously
at
marnark
of
bashad
klarnood
of
the
society
of
assassins
he
announced
marnark
of
bashad
did
i
hear
you
say
that
you
considered
members
of
the
society
as
unworthy
to
negotiate
an
affair
of
honor
with
your
friends
on
behalf
of
this
nobleman
who
has
been
courteous
enough
to
accept
your
challenge
he
demanded
marnark
of
bashad
arrogance
suffered
considerable
his
tone
became
almost
servile
not
at
all
honorable
he
protested
but
as
i
was
going
to
ask
these
gentlemen
to
represent
me
i
thought
it
would
be
more
fitting
for
the
other
gentleman
to
be
represented
by
personal
friends
also
in
that
way
sorry
marnark
the
man
at
the
table
said
i
second
you
i
have
a
quarrel
with
the
lord
virzal
too
he
rose
and
bowed
sirzob
of
abo
inasmuch
as
the
honorable
marnark
is
a
guest
at
my
table
an
affront
to
him
is
an
affront
to
me
in
my
quality
as
his
host
i
must
demand
satisfaction
from
you
lord
virzal
why
gladly
honorable
sirzob
verkan
vall
replied
this
was
getting
better
and
better
every
moment
of
course
your
friend
the
honorable
marnark
enjoys
priority
of
challenge
i
take
care
of
you
as
soon
as
i
have
shall
we
say
satisfied
him
the
earnest
and
rather
young
man
rose
also
bowing
to
verkan
vall
yirzol
of
narva
i
too
have
a
quarrel
with
you
lord
virzal
i
can
not
submit
to
the
indignity
of
having
my
food
snatched
from
in
front
of
me
as
you
just
did
i
also
demand
satisfaction
and
quite
rightly
honorable
yirzol
verkan
vall
approved
it
looks
like
such
good
soup
too
he
sorrowed
inspecting
the
front
of
marnark
tunic
my
seconds
will
negotiate
with
yours
immediately
your
satisfaction
of
course
must
come
after
that
of
honorable
sirzob
if
i
may
intrude
klarnood
put
in
smoothly
may
i
suggest
that
as
the
lord
virzal
is
represented
by
his
assassins
yours
can
represent
all
three
of
you
at
the
same
time
i
will
gladly
offer
my
own
good
offices
as
impartial
supervisor
verkan
vall
turned
and
bowed
as
to
royalty
an
honor
i
am
sure
no
one
could
act
in
that
capacity
more
satisfactorily
well
when
would
it
be
most
convenient
to
arrange
the
details
klarnood
inquired
i
am
completely
at
your
disposal
gentlemen
why
here
and
now
while
we
all
together
verkan
vall
replied
i
object
to
that
marnark
of
bashad
vociferated
we
ca
make
arrangements
here
why
all
these
hotel
people
from
the
manager
down
are
nothing
but
tipsters
for
the
newscast
services
well
what
wrong
with
that
verkan
vall
demanded
you
knew
that
when
you
slandered
the
lady
dallona
in
their
hearing
the
lord
virzal
of
verkan
is
correct
klarnood
ruled
and
the
offenses
for
which
you
have
challenged
him
were
also
committed
in
public
by
all
means
let
discuss
the
arrangements
now
he
turned
to
verkan
vall
as
the
challenged
party
you
have
the
choice
of
weapons
your
opponents
then
have
the
right
to
name
the
conditions
under
which
they
are
to
be
used
marnark
of
bashad
raised
another
outcry
over
that
the
assault
upon
him
by
the
lord
virzal
of
verkan
was
deliberately
provocative
and
therefore
tantamount
to
a
challenge
he
himself
had
the
right
to
name
the
weapons
klarnood
upheld
him
do
the
other
gentlemen
make
the
same
claim
verkan
vall
wanted
to
know
if
they
do
i
wo
allow
it
klarnood
replied
you
deliberately
provoked
honorable
marnark
but
the
offenses
of
provoking
him
at
honorable
sirzob
table
and
of
throwing
honorable
yirzol
soup
at
him
were
not
given
with
intent
to
provoke
these
gentlemen
have
a
right
to
challenge
but
not
to
consider
themselves
provoked
well
i
choose
knives
then
marnark
hastened
to
say
verkan
vall
smiled
thinly
he
had
learned
among
the
greatest
masters
of
that
art
in
all
paratime
the
third
level
khanga
pirates
of
the
caribbean
islands
and
we
fight
barefoot
stripped
to
the
waist
and
without
any
parrying
weapon
in
the
left
hand
verkan
vall
stipulated
the
beefy
marnark
fairly
licked
his
chops
in
anticipation
he
outweighed
verkan
vall
by
forty
pounds
he
saw
an
easy
victory
ahead
verkan
vall
own
confidence
increased
at
these
signs
of
his
opponent
assurance
and
as
for
honorable
sirzob
and
honorable
yirzol
i
chose
pistols
he
added
sirzob
and
yirzol
held
a
hasty
whispered
conference
speaking
both
for
honorable
yirzol
and
for
myself
sirzob
announced
we
stipulate
that
the
distance
shall
be
twenty
meters
that
the
pistols
shall
be
fully
loaded
and
that
fire
shall
be
at
will
after
the
command
twenty
rounds
fire
at
will
at
twenty
meters
olirzon
hooted
you
must
think
our
principal
as
bad
a
shot
as
you
are
the
four
assassins
stepped
aside
and
held
a
long
discussion
about
something
with
considerable
argument
and
gesticulation
klarnood
observing
verkan
vall
impatience
leaned
close
to
him
and
whispered
this
is
highly
irregular
we
must
pretend
ignorance
and
be
patient
they
laying
bets
on
the
outcome
you
must
do
your
best
lord
virzal
you
do
want
your
supporters
to
lose
money
he
said
it
quite
seriously
as
though
the
outcome
were
otherwise
a
matter
of
indifference
to
verkan
vall
marnark
wanted
to
discuss
time
and
place
and
proposed
that
all
three
duels
be
fought
at
dawn
on
the
fourth
landing
stage
of
darsh
central
hospital
that
was
closest
to
the
maternity
wards
and
statistics
showed
that
most
births
occurred
just
before
that
hour
certainly
not
verkan
vall
vetoed
we
fight
here
and
now
i
do
propose
going
a
couple
of
hundred
miles
to
meet
you
at
any
such
unholy
hour
we
fight
in
the
nearest
hallway
that
provides
twenty
meters
shooting
distance
marnark
sirzob
and
yirzol
all
clamored
in
protest
verkan
vall
shouted
them
down
drawing
on
his
hypnotically
acquired
knowledge
of
duelling
customs
the
code
explicitly
states
that
satisfaction
shall
be
rendered
as
promptly
as
possible
and
i
insist
on
a
literal
interpretation
i
not
going
to
inconvenience
myself
and
klarnood
and
these
four
just
to
humor
statisticalist
superstitions
the
manager
of
the
hotel
drawn
to
the
martian
room
by
the
uproar
offered
a
hallway
connecting
the
kitchens
with
the
refrigerator
rooms
it
was
fifty
meters
long
by
five
in
width
was
and
soundproof
and
had
a
bay
in
which
the
seconds
and
other
could
stand
during
the
firing
they
repaired
thither
in
a
body
klarnood
gathering
up
several
hotel
servants
on
the
way
through
the
kitchen
verkan
vall
stripped
to
the
waist
pulled
off
his
ankle
boots
and
examined
olirzon
knife
its
tapering
blade
was
at
the
point
and
its
handle
was
covered
with
black
velvet
to
afford
a
good
grip
and
wound
with
gold
wire
he
nodded
approvingly
gripped
it
with
his
index
finger
crooked
around
the
and
advanced
to
meet
marnark
of
bashad
as
he
had
expected
the
burly
politician
was
depending
upon
his
greater
brawn
to
overpower
his
antagonist
he
advanced
with
a
sidling
gait
his
knife
hand
against
his
right
hip
and
his
left
hand
extended
in
front
verkan
vall
nodded
with
pleased
satisfaction
a
then
he
blinked
why
the
fellow
was
actually
holding
his
knife
reversed
his
little
finger
to
the
guard
and
his
thumb
on
the
pommel
verkan
vall
went
briskly
to
meet
him
made
a
feint
at
his
knife
hand
with
his
own
left
and
then
quickly
to
the
right
as
marnark
left
hand
grabbed
at
his
right
wrist
his
left
hand
brushed
against
it
and
closed
into
a
fist
with
marnark
left
thumb
inside
of
it
he
gave
a
quick
downward
twist
with
his
wrist
pulling
marnark
off
balance
caught
by
surprise
marnark
stumbled
his
knife
flailing
wildly
away
from
verkan
vall
as
he
stumbled
forward
verkan
vall
pivoted
on
his
left
heel
and
drove
the
point
of
his
knife
into
the
back
of
neck
twisting
it
as
he
jerked
it
free
at
the
same
time
he
released
marnark
thumb
the
politician
continued
his
stumble
and
fell
forward
on
his
face
blood
spurting
from
his
neck
he
gave
a
twitch
or
so
and
was
still
verkan
vall
stooped
and
wiped
the
knife
on
the
dead
clothes
another
khanga
pirate
gesture
and
then
returned
it
to
olirzon
nice
weapon
olirzon
he
said
it
fitted
my
hand
as
though
i
been
born
holding
it
you
used
it
as
though
you
had
lord
virzal
the
assassin
replied
only
eight
seconds
from
the
time
you
closed
with
him
illustration
the
function
of
the
hotel
servants
whom
klarnood
had
gathered
up
now
became
apparent
they
advanced
took
the
body
of
marnark
by
the
heels
and
dragged
it
out
of
the
way
the
others
watched
this
removal
with
mixed
emotions
the
two
remaining
principals
were
impassive
and
their
two
assassins
who
had
probably
bet
heavily
on
marnark
were
chagrined
and
klarnood
was
looking
at
verkan
vall
with
a
considerable
accretion
of
respect
verkan
vall
pulled
on
his
boots
and
resumed
his
clothing
there
followed
some
argument
about
the
pistols
it
was
finally
decided
that
each
combatant
should
use
his
own
weapon
all
three
were
nearly
enough
alike
small
weapons
rather
heavier
than
they
looked
firing
a
tiny
bullet
at
ten
thousand
on
impact
such
a
bullet
would
almost
disintegrate
a
man
hit
anywhere
in
the
body
with
one
would
be
killed
instantly
his
nervous
system
paralyzed
and
his
heart
stopped
by
internal
pressure
each
of
the
pistols
carried
twenty
rounds
in
the
magazine
verkan
vall
and
sirzob
of
abo
took
their
places
their
pistols
lowered
at
their
sides
facing
each
other
across
a
measured
twenty
meters
are
you
ready
gentlemen
klarnood
asked
you
will
not
raise
your
pistols
until
the
command
to
fire
you
may
fire
at
will
after
it
ready
illustration
both
pistols
swung
up
to
level
verkan
vall
found
sirzob
head
in
his
sights
and
squeezed
the
pistol
kicked
back
in
his
hand
and
he
saw
a
lance
of
blue
flame
jump
from
the
muzzle
of
sirzob
both
weapons
barked
together
and
with
the
double
report
came
the
sound
of
sirzob
bullet
passing
verkan
vall
head
then
face
altered
its
appearance
unpleasantly
and
he
pitched
forward
verkan
vall
thumbed
on
his
safety
and
stood
motionless
while
the
servants
advanced
took
sirzob
body
by
the
heels
and
dragged
it
over
beside
marnark
all
right
honorable
yirzol
you
next
verkan
vall
called
out
the
lord
virzal
has
fired
one
shot
one
of
the
opposing
seconds
objected
and
honorable
yirzol
has
a
full
magazine
the
lord
virzal
should
put
in
another
magazine
i
grant
him
the
advantage
let
get
on
with
it
verkan
vall
said
yirzol
of
narva
advanced
to
the
firing
point
he
was
not
afraid
of
death
none
of
the
people
were
their
language
contained
no
word
to
express
the
concept
of
total
and
final
extinction
and
discarnation
by
gunshot
was
almost
entirely
painless
but
he
was
beginning
to
suspect
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
by
getting
into
this
affair
he
had
work
in
his
present
reincarnation
which
he
wanted
to
finish
and
his
political
party
would
suffer
loss
both
of
his
services
and
of
prestige
are
you
ready
gentlemen
klarnood
intoned
ritualistically
you
will
not
raise
your
pistols
until
the
command
to
fire
you
may
fire
at
will
after
it
ready
verkan
vall
shot
yirzol
of
narva
through
the
head
before
the
latter
had
his
pistol
half
raised
yirzol
fell
forward
on
the
splash
of
blood
sirzob
had
made
and
the
servants
came
forward
and
dragged
his
body
over
with
the
others
it
reminded
verkan
vail
of
some
sort
of
industrial
operation
he
replaced
the
two
expended
rounds
in
his
magazine
with
fresh
ones
and
slid
the
pistol
back
into
its
holster
the
two
assassins
whose
principals
had
been
so
expeditiously
massacred
were
beginning
to
count
up
their
losses
and
pay
off
the
winners
klarnood
the
of
the
society
of
assassins
came
over
hooking
fingers
and
clapping
shoulders
with
verkan
vall
lord
virzal
i
seen
quite
a
few
duels
but
nothing
quite
like
that
he
said
you
should
have
been
an
assassin
that
was
a
considerable
compliment
verkan
vall
thanked
him
modestly
i
like
to
talk
to
you
privately
the
continued
i
think
it
be
worth
your
while
if
we
have
a
few
words
together
verkan
vall
nodded
my
suite
is
on
the
fifteenth
floor
above
will
that
be
all
right
he
waited
until
the
losers
had
finished
settling
their
bets
then
motioned
to
his
own
pair
of
assassins
as
they
emerged
into
the
martian
room
again
the
manager
was
waiting
he
looked
as
though
he
were
about
to
demand
that
verkan
vall
vacate
his
suite
however
when
he
saw
the
arm
of
the
of
the
society
of
assassins
draped
amicably
over
his
guest
shoulder
he
came
forward
bowing
and
smiling
larnorm
i
want
you
to
put
five
of
your
best
assassins
to
guarding
the
approaches
to
the
lord
virzal
suite
klarnood
told
him
send
five
more
from
assassins
hall
to
replace
them
at
their
ordinary
duties
and
i
hold
you
responsible
with
your
carnate
existence
for
the
lord
virzal
safety
in
this
hotel
understand
oh
yes
honorable
you
may
trust
me
the
lord
virzal
will
be
perfectly
safe
in
verkan
vall
suite
above
klarnood
sat
down
and
got
out
his
pipe
filling
it
with
tobacco
lightly
mixed
with
to
his
surprise
he
saw
his
host
light
a
plain
tobacco
cigarette
do
you
use
he
asked
very
little
verkan
vall
replied
i
grow
it
if
you
see
the
bums
who
hang
around
our
drying
sheds
on
venus
cadging
rejected
leaves
and
smoking
themselves
into
a
stupor
you
be
frugal
in
using
it
too
klarnood
nodded
you
know
most
men
would
want
a
pipe
of
fifty
percent
or
a
straight
cigarette
after
what
you
been
through
he
said
i
need
something
like
that
to
deaden
my
conscience
if
i
had
one
to
deaden
verkan
vall
said
as
it
is
i
feel
like
a
murderer
of
babes
that
overgrown
fool
marnark
handled
his
knife
like
a
the
young
fellow
could
handle
a
pistol
at
all
i
suppose
the
old
fellow
sirzob
was
a
fair
shot
but
dropping
him
was
any
great
feat
of
arms
either
klarnood
looked
at
him
curiously
for
a
moment
you
know
he
said
at
length
i
believe
you
actually
mean
that
well
until
he
met
you
marnark
of
bashad
was
rated
as
the
best
in
darsh
sirzob
had
ten
dueling
victories
to
his
credit
and
young
yirzol
four
he
puffed
slowly
on
his
pipe
i
like
you
lord
virzal
a
great
assassin
was
lost
when
you
decided
to
reincarnate
as
a
venusian
hate
to
see
you
discarnated
without
proper
warning
i
take
it
ignorant
of
the
intricacies
of
terran
politics
to
a
large
extent
yes
well
do
you
know
who
those
three
men
were
when
verkan
vall
shook
his
head
klarnood
continued
marnark
was
the
son
and
associate
of
old
mirzark
of
bashad
the
statisticalist
party
leader
sirzob
of
abo
was
their
propaganda
director
and
yirzol
of
narva
was
their
leading
theorist
and
their
candidate
for
executive
chairman
in
six
minutes
with
one
knife
thrust
and
two
shots
you
did
the
statisticalist
party
an
injury
second
only
to
that
done
them
by
the
young
lady
in
whose
name
you
were
fighting
in
two
weeks
there
will
be
a
general
election
as
it
stands
the
statisticalists
have
a
majority
of
the
seats
in
parliament
and
on
the
executive
council
as
a
result
of
your
work
and
the
lady
dallona
they
lose
that
majority
and
more
when
the
votes
are
tallied
is
that
another
reason
why
you
like
me
verkan
vall
asked
unofficially
yes
as
of
the
society
of
assassins
i
must
be
nonpolitical
the
society
is
rigidly
so
if
we
let
ourselves
become
involved
as
an
organization
in
politics
we
could
control
the
system
government
inside
of
five
years
and
we
be
wiped
out
of
existence
in
fifty
years
by
the
very
forces
we
sought
to
control
klarnood
said
but
personally
i
would
like
to
see
the
statisticalist
party
destroyed
if
they
succeed
in
their
program
of
socialization
the
society
would
be
finished
a
socialist
state
is
in
its
final
development
an
absolute
total
state
no
total
state
can
tolerate
and
organizations
so
we
have
adopted
the
policy
of
giving
a
little
inconspicuous
aid
here
and
there
to
people
who
are
dangerous
to
the
statisticalists
the
lady
dallona
of
hadron
and
harnosh
of
hosh
are
such
persons
you
appear
to
be
another
that
why
i
ordered
that
fellow
larnorm
to
make
sure
you
were
safe
in
his
hotel
where
is
the
lady
dallona
verkan
vall
asked
from
your
use
of
the
present
tense
i
assume
you
believe
her
to
be
still
carnate
klarnood
looked
at
verkan
vall
keenly
that
a
pretty
blunt
question
lord
virzal
he
said
i
wish
i
knew
a
little
more
about
you
when
you
and
your
assassins
started
inquiring
about
the
lady
dallona
i
tried
to
check
up
on
you
i
found
out
that
you
had
come
to
darsh
from
ghamma
on
a
ship
of
the
family
of
zorda
accompanied
by
brarnend
of
zorda
himself
and
that
all
i
could
find
out
you
claim
to
be
a
venusian
planter
and
you
might
be
any
terran
who
can
handle
weapons
as
you
can
would
have
come
to
my
notice
long
ago
but
you
have
no
more
ascertainable
history
than
if
you
stepped
out
of
another
dimension
that
was
getting
uncomfortably
close
to
the
truth
in
fact
it
the
truth
verkan
vall
laughed
well
confidentially
he
said
i
from
the
arcturus
system
i
followed
the
lady
dallona
here
from
our
home
planet
and
when
i
have
rescued
her
from
among
you
solarians
i
shall
according
to
our
customs
receive
her
hand
in
marriage
as
she
is
the
daughter
of
the
emperor
of
arcturus
that
be
quite
a
good
thing
for
me
klarnood
chuckled
you
know
you
only
have
to
tell
me
that
about
three
or
four
times
and
i
start
believing
it
he
said
and
harnosh
of
hosh
would
believe
it
the
first
time
he
been
talking
to
himself
ever
since
the
lady
dallona
started
her
experimental
work
here
lord
virzal
i
going
to
take
a
chance
on
you
the
lady
dallona
is
still
carnate
or
was
four
days
ago
and
the
same
for
dirzed
they
both
went
into
hiding
after
the
discarnation
feast
of
garnon
of
roxor
to
escape
the
enmity
of
the
statisticalists
two
days
after
they
disappeared
dirzed
called
assassins
hall
and
reported
this
but
told
us
nothing
more
i
suppose
in
about
three
or
four
days
i
could
contact
with
him
we
want
the
public
to
think
that
the
statisticalists
made
away
with
the
lady
dallona
at
least
until
the
election
over
verkan
vall
nodded
i
was
pretty
sure
that
was
the
situation
he
said
it
may
be
that
they
will
get
in
touch
with
me
if
they
do
i
need
your
help
in
reaching
them
why
do
you
think
the
lady
dallona
will
try
to
reach
you
she
needs
all
the
help
she
can
get
she
knows
she
can
get
plenty
from
me
why
do
you
think
i
interrupted
my
search
for
her
and
risked
my
carnate
existence
to
fight
those
people
over
a
matter
of
verbalisms
and
political
propaganda
verkan
vall
went
to
the
newscast
visiplate
and
snapped
it
on
we
see
if
i
getting
results
yet
the
plate
lighted
and
a
handsome
young
man
in
a
green
suit
was
speaking
out
of
it
where
he
is
heavily
guarded
by
assassins
however
in
an
exclusive
interview
with
representatives
of
this
service
the
assassin
hirzif
one
of
the
two
who
seconded
the
men
the
lord
virzal
fought
said
that
in
his
opinion
all
of
the
three
were
so
outclassed
as
to
have
had
no
chance
whatever
and
that
he
had
already
refused
an
offer
of
ten
thousand
system
monetary
units
to
discarnate
the
lord
virzal
for
the
statisticalist
party
i
want
to
discarnate
hirzif
the
assassin
said
invite
in
my
friends
and
do
it
properly
until
i
do
i
would
go
up
against
the
lord
virzal
of
verkan
for
ten
million
verkan
vall
snapped
off
the
visiplate
see
what
i
mean
he
asked
i
fought
those
politicians
just
for
the
advertising
if
dallona
and
dirzed
are
anywhere
near
a
visiplate
they
know
how
to
reach
me
hirzif
should
have
talked
about
refusing
that
retainer
klarnood
frowned
that
is
good
assassin
ethics
why
yes
lord
virzal
that
was
cleverly
planned
it
ought
to
get
results
but
i
wish
you
get
the
lady
dallona
out
of
darsh
and
preferably
off
terra
as
soon
as
you
can
we
benefited
by
this
so
far
but
i
should
like
to
see
things
go
much
further
a
real
civil
war
could
develop
out
of
this
situation
and
i
do
want
that
call
on
me
for
help
i
give
you
a
code
word
to
use
at
assassins
hall
a
real
civil
war
was
developing
even
as
klarnood
spoke
by
of
the
next
day
the
fighting
that
had
been
partially
suppressed
by
the
constabulary
had
broken
out
anew
the
assassins
employed
by
the
solar
hotel
heavily
during
the
night
had
fought
a
pitched
battle
with
statisticalist
partisans
on
the
above
verkan
vall
suite
and
now
several
constabulary
airboats
were
patrolling
around
the
building
the
rule
on
constabulary
interference
seemed
to
be
that
while
individuals
had
an
unquestionable
right
to
shoot
out
their
differences
among
themselves
any
fighting
likely
to
endanger
nonparticipants
was
taboo
just
how
successful
in
enforcing
this
rule
the
constabulary
were
was
open
to
some
doubt
ever
since
arising
verkan
vall
had
heard
the
crash
of
small
arms
and
the
hammering
of
automatic
weapons
in
other
parts
of
the
towering
there
had
been
a
civil
war
on
the
sector
for
over
five
centuries
he
knew
but
then
hadron
dalla
doctor
of
psychic
science
and
intertemporal
extraordinary
had
only
been
on
this
sector
for
a
little
under
a
year
if
anything
he
was
surprised
that
the
explosion
had
taken
so
long
to
occur
one
of
the
servants
furnished
to
him
by
the
hotel
management
approached
him
in
the
drawing
room
holding
a
wafer
of
white
plastic
lord
virzal
there
is
a
masked
assassin
in
the
hallway
who
brought
this
under
assassins
truce
he
said
verkan
vall
took
the
wafer
and
pared
off
three
of
the
four
edges
which
showed
black
where
they
had
been
fused
unfolding
it
he
found
as
he
had
expected
that
the
pyrographed
message
within
was
in
the
alphabet
and
language
of
the
first
paratime
level
vall
darling
am
i
glad
you
got
here
this
time
i
really
in
the
middle
but
good
the
assassin
dirzed
who
brings
this
is
in
my
service
you
can
trust
him
implicitly
he
about
the
only
person
in
darsh
you
can
trust
he
bring
you
to
where
i
am
dalla
i
hope
you
not
still
angry
about
that
musician
i
told
you
at
the
time
that
he
was
just
helping
me
with
an
experiment
in
telepathy
verkan
vall
grinned
at
the
postscript
that
had
been
twenty
years
ago
when
he
been
eighty
and
she
been
seventy
he
supposed
she
expect
him
to
take
up
his
old
relationship
with
her
again
it
probably
would
last
any
longer
than
it
had
the
other
time
he
recalled
a
fourth
level
proverb
about
the
leopard
and
his
spots
it
certainly
would
be
boring
though
tell
the
assassin
to
come
in
he
directed
then
he
tossed
the
message
down
on
a
table
outside
of
himself
nobody
in
darsh
could
read
it
but
the
woman
who
had
sent
it
if
as
he
thought
highly
probable
the
statisticalists
had
spies
among
the
hotel
staff
it
might
serve
to
reduce
some
cryptanalyst
to
gibbering
insanity
the
assassin
entered
drawing
off
a
cowllike
mask
he
was
the
man
whose
arm
dalla
had
been
holding
in
the
visiplate
picture
verkan
vall
even
recognized
the
extremely
ornate
pistol
and
knife
on
his
belt
dirzed
the
assassin
he
named
himself
if
you
wish
we
can
visiphone
assassins

for
verification
of
my
identity
lord
virzal
of
verkan
and
my
assassins
marnik
and
olirzon
they
all
hooked
fingers
and
clapped
shoulders
with
the
newcomer
that
wo
be
needed
verkan
vall
told
dirzed
i
know
you
from
seeing
you
with
the
lady
dallona
on
the
visiplate
you
her
faithful
assassin
dirzed
face
normally
the
color
of
a
good
walnut
gunstock
turned
almost
black
he
used
shockingly
bad
language
and
that
why
i
have
to
wear
this
abomination
he
finished
displaying
the
mask
the
lady
dallona
and
i
ca
show
our
faces
anywhere
if
we
did
every
statisticalist
and
his
brat
would
know
us
and
we
be
fighting
off
an
army
of
them
in
five
minutes
where
the
lady
dallona
now
in
hiding
lord
virzal
at
a
private
dwelling
dome
in
the
forest
she
most
anxious
to
see
you
i
to
take
you
to
her
and
i
would
strongly
advise
that
you
bring
your
assassins
along
there
are
other
people
at
this
dome
and
they
are
not
personally
loyal
to
the
lady
dallona
i
no
reason
to
suspect
them
of
secret
enmity
but
their
friendship
is
based
entirely
on
political
expediency
and
political
expediency
is
subject
to
change
without
notice
verkan

have
you
an
airboat

we
go

a
gesture
to
his
assassins

into
another
room
and
returned
carrying
light
automatic
weapons
in
their
hands
and
pouches
of
spare
drums
slung
over

may
i
suggest

the

against

skin
as
he
gave
verkan
vall
a
quick
smile
by
all
means
lord
virzal
i
would
much
rather
be
distrusted
than
to
find
that
my
client
friends
were
not
discreet
there
were
a
couple
of
hotel
assassins
guarding
dirzed

on
the

marnik
climbed
in

beside
him

entered

what

of
the

was
a

over
to
the
volitionalists
on
the
strength
of
this
communication
prince
jirzyn
and
lord
girzon
the
new
of
roxor
decided
that
there
would
be
trouble
in

days
so
they
advised
the
lady
dallona
to
come
to
this
hunting
lodge
for
safety

and
i

replied
noncommittally
as
he
dirzed
and
olirzon
climbed
out
of
the
airboat
marnik
was
holding
it
an
unobtrusive
inch
or
so
above
the
flat
top
of
the
dome
away
from
the
edge
of
the
pavilion
roof
the
two
assassins
greeted
him
and
a
man
in
garb
and
wearing
a
hunting
knife
and
a
long
hunting
pistol
approached
lord
virzal
of
verkan
welcome
to
starpha

the
lady
dallona
awaits
you
below
verkan
vall
had
never
been
in
an
dwelling
dome
but
a
description
of
such
structures
had
been
included
in
his
indoctrination
originally
they
had
been
the
standard
structure
for
all
purposes
about
two
thousand
elapsed
years
ago
when
nationalism
had
still
existed
on
the
sector
the
cities
had
been
almost
entirely
under
ground
as
protection
from
air
attack
even
now
the
design
had
been
retained
by
those
who
wished
to
live
apart
from
the
towering
city
units
to
preserve
the
natural
appearance
of
the
landscape
the
starpha
hunting
lodge
was
typical
of
such
domes
under
it
was
a
circular
well
eighty
feet
in
depth
and
fifty
in
width
with
a
fountain
and
a
shallow
circular
pool
at
the
bottom
the
storerooms
kitchens
and
servants
quarters
were
at
the
top
the
living
quarters
at
the
bottom
in
segments
of
a
wide
circle
around
the
well
back
of
balconies
tarnod
the
gamekeeper
dirzed
performed
the
introductions
and
erarno
and
kirzol
assassins
verkan
vall
hooked
fingers
and
clapped
shoulders
with
them
tarnod
accompanied
them
to
the
lifter
tubes
two
percent
positive
gravitation
for
descent
and
two
percent
negative
for
ascent
and
they
all
floated
down
the
former
like
balloons
to
the
bottom
level
the
lady
dallona
is
in
the
gun
room
tarnod
informed
verkan
vall
making
as
though
to
guide
him
thanks
tarnod
we
know
the
way
dirzed
told
him
shortly
turning
his
back
on
the
and
walking
toward
a
closed
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
fountain
verkan
vall
and
olirzon
followed
for
a
moment
tarnod
stood
looking
after
them
then
he
followed
the
other
two
assassins
into
the
ascent
tube
i
do
relish
that
fellow
dirzed
explained
the
family
of
starpha
use
him
for
work
they
could
hire
an
assassin
to
do
at
any
price
i
been
here
often
when
i
was
with
the
lord
garnon
i
always
thought
he
had
something
on
prince
jirzyn
he
knocked
sharply
on
the
closed
door
with
the
butt
of
his
pistol
in
a
moment
it
slid
open
and
a
young
assassin
with
a
narrow
mustache
and
a
tuft
of
chin
beard
looked
out
ah
dirzed
he
stepped
outside
the
lady
dallona
is
within
i
return
her
to
your
care
verkan
vall
entered
followed
by
dirzed
and
olirzon
the
big
room
was
fitted
with
reclining
chairs
and
couches
and
low
tables
its
walls
were
hung
with
the
heads
of
deer
and
boar
and
wolves
and
with
racks
holding
rifles
and
hunting
pistols
and
fowling
pieces
it
was
filled
with
the
soft
glow
of
indirect
cold
light
at
the
far
side
of
the
room
a
young
woman
was
seated
at
a
desk
speaking
softly
into
a
sound
transcriber
as
they
entered
she
snapped
it
off
and
rose
hadron
dalla
wore
the
same
costume
verkan
vall
had
seen
on
the
visiplate
he
recognized
her
instantly
it
took
her
a
second
or
two
to
perceive
verkan
vall
under
the
brown
skin
and
black
hair
of
the
lord
virzal
of
verkan
then
her
face
lighted
with
a
happy
smile
why
she
whooped
running
across
the
room
and
tossing
herself
into
his
not
particularly
reluctant
arms
after
all
it
had
been
twenty
years
i
did
know
you
at
first
you
mean
in
these
clothes
he
asked
seeing
that
she
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
the
presence
of
the
two
assassins
she
had
even
called
him
by
his
first
level
name
but
that
was
unimportant
the
affectionate
diminutive
was
formed
by
omitting
the
or
well
they
not
exactly
what
i
generally
wear
on
the
plantation
he
kissed
her
again
then
turned
to
his
companions
your
pardon
it
been
something
over
a
year
since
we
seen
each
other
olirzon
was
smiling
at
the
affectionate
reunion
dirzed
wore
a
look
of
amused
resignation
as
though
he
might
have
expected
something
like
this
to
happen
verkan
vall
and
dalla
sat
down
on
a
couch
near
the
desk
that
was
really
sweet
of
you
vall
fighting
those
men
for
talking
about
me
she
began
you
took
an
awful
chance
though
but
if
you
had
i
never
have
known
you
were
in
darsh
that
was
why
you
did
it
was
it
well
i
had
to
do
something
everybody
either
did
know
or
saying
where
you
were
i
assumed
from
the
circumstances
that
you
were
hiding
somewhere
tell
me
dalla
do
you
really
have
scientific
proof
of
reincarnation
i
mean
as
an
established
fact
oh
yes
these
people
on
this
sector
have
had
that
for
over
ten
centuries
they
have
hypnotic
techniques
for
getting
back
into
a
part
of
the
subconscious
mind
that
we
never
been
able
to
reach
and
after
i
found
out
how
they
did
it
i
was
able
to
adapt
some
of
our
techniques
to
it
and
all
right
that
what
i
wanted
to
know
he
cut
her
off
getting
out
of
here
right
away
but
where
ghamma
in
an
airboat
i
have
outside
and
then
back
to
the
first
level
unless
there
a
conveyor
somewhere
nearer
but
why
vall
i
not
ready
to
go
back
i
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
here
yet
they
getting
ready
to
set
up
a
series
of
at
the
institute
and
then
i
in
the
middle
of
an
experiment
a
experiment
see
i
distributed
two
hundred
sets
of
equipment
for
my
new
technique
of
this
drug
and
sound
records
of
the
hypnotic
suggestion
formula
which
can
be
played
on
an
ordinary
reproducer
it
just
a
crude
variant
of
our
process
except
that
instead
of
implanting
information
in
the
subconscious
mind
to
be
brought
at
will
to
the
level
of
consciousness
it
works
the
other
way
and
draws
into
conscious
knowledge
information
already
in
the
subconscious
mind
the
way
these
people
have
always
done
has
been
to
put
the
subject
in
an
hypnotic
trance
and
then
record
verbal
statements
made
in
the
trance
state
when
the
subject
comes
out
of
the
trance
the
record
is
all
there
is
because
the
memories
of
past
reincarnations
have
never
been
in
the
conscious
mind
but
with
my
process
the
subject
can
consciously
remember
everything
about
his
last
reincarnation
and
as
many
reincarnations
before
that
as
he
wishes
to
i
have
heard
from
any
of
the
people
who
received
these
kits
and
i
really
must
dalla
i
do
want
to
have
to
pull
paratime
police
authority
on
you
but
so
help
me
if
you
do
come
back
voluntarily
with
me
i
will
security
of
the
secret
of
paratime
transposition
oh
my
eye
dalla
exclaimed
do
give
me
that
vall
look
dalla
suppose
you
get
discarnated
here
verkan
vall
said
you
say
reincarnation
is
a
scientific
fact
well
you
reincarnate
on
this
sector
and
then
you
take
a
under
hypnosis
and
when
you
did
the
paratime
secret
would
be
a
secret
any
more
oh
dalla
hand
went
to
her
mouth
in
consternation
like
every
paratimer
she
was
conditioned
to
shrink
with
all
her
being
from
the
mere
thought
of
revealing
to
any
dweller
the
secret
ability
of
her
race
to
pass
to
other
or
even
the
existence
of
alternate
lines
of
probability
and
if
i
took
one
of
the
i
blat
out
everything
i
would
be
able
to
keep
a
thing
back
and
i
even
know
the
principles
of
transposition
she
looked
at
him
aghast
when
i
get
back
i
going
to
put
a
recommendation
through
department
channels
that
this
whole
sector
be
declared
out
of
bounds
for
all
until
you
people
at
rhogom
foundation
work
out
the
problem
of
discarnate
return
to
the
first
level
he
told
her
now
have
you
any
notes
or
anything
you
want
to
take
back
with
you
she
rose
yes
just
what
on
the
desk
find
me
something
to
put
the
tape
spools
and
notebooks
in
while
i
getting
them
in
order
he
secured
a
large
game
bag
from
under
a
rack
of
fowling
pieces
and
held
it
while
she
sorted
the
material
rapidly
stuffing
spools
of
record
tape
and
notebooks
into
it
they
had
barely
begun
when
the
door
slid
open
and
olirzon
who
had
gone
outside
sprang
into
the
room
his
pistol
drawn
swearing
vilely
they
us
he
cried
the
servants
of
starpha
have
turned
on
us
he
holstered
his
pistol
and
snatched
up
his
taking
cover
behind
the
edge
of
the
door
and
letting
go
with
a
burst
in
the
direction
of
the
lifter
tubes
got
that
one
he
grunted
what
happened
olirzon
verkan
vall
asked
dropping
the
game
bag
on
the
table
and
hurrying
across
the
room
i
went
up
to
see
how
marnik
was
making
out
as
i
came
out
of
the
lifter
tube
one
of
the
obscenities
took
a
shot
at
me
with
a
hunting
pistol
he
missed
me
i
did
miss
him
then
a
couple
more
of
them
were
coming
up
with
fowling
pieces
i
shot
one
of
them
before
they
could
fire
and
jumped
into
the
descent
tube
and
came
down
heels
over
ears
i
do
know
what
happened
to
marnik
he
fired
another
burst
and
swore
missed
him
assassins
truce
assassins

a
voice
howled
out
of
the
descent
tube
hold
your
fire
we
want

parley
who

dirzed
shouted
over
olirzon
shoulder
you
sarnax
come
on

wo
shoot
the
young
assassin
with
the
mustache
and
chin
beard
emerged
from
the
descent
tube
his
weapons
sheathed
and
his
clasped
hands
extended
in
front
of
him
in
a
peculiarly
manner
dirzed
and
olirzon
stepped
out
of
the
gun
room
followed
by
verkan
vall
and
hadron
dalla
olirzon
had
left
his
behind
they
met
the
other
assassin
by
the
rim
of
the
fountain
pool
lady
dallona
of
hadron
the
starpha
assassin
began
i
and
my
colleagues
in
the
employ
of
the
family
of
starpha
have
received
orders
from
our
clients
to
withdraw
our
protection
from
you
and
to
discarnate
you
and
all
with
you
who
undertake
to
protect
or
support
you
that
much
sounded
like
a
recitation
of
some
established
formula
then
his
voice
became
more
conversational
i
and
my
colleagues
erarno
and
kirzol
and
harnif
offer
our
apologies
for
the
barbarity
of
the
servants
of
the
family
of
starpha
in
attacking
without
declaration
of
cessation
of
friendship
was
anybody
hurt
or
discarnated
none
of
us
olirzon
said
how
about
marnik
he
was
warned
before
hostilities
were
begun
against
him
sarnax
replied
we
will
allow
five
minutes
until
olirzon
who
had
been
looking
up
the
well
suddenly
sprang
at
dalla
knocking
her
flat
and
at
the
same
time
jerking
out
his
pistol
before
he
could
raise
it
a
shot
banged
from
above
and
he
fell
on
his
face
dirzed
verkan
vall
and
sarnax
all
drew
their
pistols
but
whoever
had
fired
the
shot
had
vanished
there
was
an
outburst
of
shouting
above
get
to
cover
sarnax
told
the
others
we
let
you
know
when
ready
to
attack
we
have
to
deal
with
whoever
fired
that
shot
first
he
looked
at
the
dead
body
on
the
floor
exclaimed
angrily
and
hurried
to
the
ascent
tube
springing
upward
verkan
vall
replaced
the
small
pistol
in
his
shoulder
holster
and
took
olirzon
belt
with
his
knife
and
heavier
pistol
well
there
you
see
dirzed
said
as
they
went
back
to
the
gun
room
so
much
for
political
expediency
i
think
i
understand
why
your
picture
and
the
lady
dallona
were
exhibited
so
widely
verkan
vall
said
now
anybody
would
recognize
your
bodies
and
blame
the
statisticalists
for
discarnating
you
that
thought
had
occurred
to
me
lord
virzal
dirzed
said
i
suppose
our
bodies
will
be
atrociously
but
not
unidentifiably
mutilated
to
further
enrage
the
public
he
added
placidly
if
i
get
out
of
this
carnate
i
going
to
pay
somebody
off
for
it
after
a
few
minutes
there
was
more
shouting
of
assassins
truce
from
the
descent
tube
the
two
assassins
erarno
and
kirzol
emerged
dragging
the
gamekeeper
tarnod
between
them
the
face
was
bloody
and
his
jaw
seemed
to
be
broken
sarnax
followed
carrying
a
long
hunting
pistol
in
his
hand
here
he
is
he
announced
he
fired
during
assassins
truce
subject
to
assassins
justice
he
nodded
to
the
others
they
threw
the
gamekeeper
forward
on
the
floor
and
sarnax
shot
him
through
the
head
then
tossed
the
pistol
down
beside
him
any
more
of
these
people
who
violate
the
decencies
will
be
treated
similarly
he
promised
thank
you
sarnax
dirzed
spoke
up
but
we
lost
an
assassin
discarnating

lackey
wo
equalize
that

you
should
retire

of
your
number

at

a

the

at
some
length
then
sarnax
hooked

and
clapped

told

said
and
in

of

your
men
he
was
going
to
shoot
marnik
at
once
but
erarno
and
i
and
his
assassin
stopped
him
we
warned
marnik
about
the
change
in
the
situation
according
to
the
code
expecting
marnik
to
go
down
here
and
join
you
instead
he
lifted
the
airboat
zoomed
over
boat
and
let
go
a
rocket
blast
setting
girzad
boat
on
fire
well
that
was
a
hostile
act
so
we
all
fired
after
him
we
must
have
hit
something
because
the
boat
went
down
trailing
smoke
about
ten
miles
away
girzad
got
another
airboat
out
of
the
hangar
and
he
and
his
assassin
started
after
your
man
about
that
time
your
assassin
olirzon
happy
reincarnation
to
him
came
up
and
the
starpha
servants
fired
at
him
and
he
fired
back
and
discarnated
two
of
them
and
then
jumped
down
the
descent
tube
one
of
the
servants
jumped
after
him
i
found
his
body
at
the
bottom
when
i
came
down
to
warn
you
formally
you
know
what
happened
after
that
but
why
did
prince
jirzyn
order
our
discarnation
dalla
wanted
to
know
was
it
to
blame
the
statisticalists
with
it
sarnax
about
to
answer
broke
off
suddenly
and
began
firing
at
the
opening
of
the
ascent
tube
with
a
hunting
pistol
i
got
him
he
said
in
a
pleased
tone
that
was
erarno
he
was
always
playing
tricks
with
the
tubes
climbing
down
against
negative
gravity
and
up
against
positive
gravity
his
body
will
float
up
to
the
top
why
lady
dallona
that
was
only
part
of
it
you
did
hear
about
the
big
scandal
on
the
newscast
then
we
did
have
it
on
what
scandal
sarnax
laughed
oh
the
very
father
and
of
all
scandals
you
ought
to
know
about
it
because
you
started
it
that
why
prince
jirzyn
wants
you
out
of
the
body
you
devised
a
process
by
which
people
could
give
themselves
of
previous
reincarnations
did
you
and
distributed
apparatus
to
do
it
with
and
gave
one
set
to
young
tarnov
the
son
of
lord
tirzov
of
fastor
dalla
nodded
sarnax
continued
well
last
evening
tarnox
of
fastor
used
his
recall
outfit
and
what
do
you
think
it
seems
that
thirty
years
ago
in
his
last
reincarnation
he
was
jirzid
of
starpha
jirzyn
older
brother
jirzid
was
betrothed
to
the
lady
annitra
of
zabna
well
his
younger
brother
was
carrying
on
a
clandestine
affair
with
the
lady
annitra
and
he
also
wanted
the
title
of
prince
and
of
starpha
so
he
bribed
this
fellow
tarnod
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
of
discarnating
and
who
was
an
underservant
here
at
the
hunting
lodge
between
them
they
shot
jirzid
during
a
boar
hunt
an
accident
of
course
so
jirzyn
married
the
lady
annitra
and
when
old
prince
jarnid
his
father
discarnated
a
year
later
he
succeeded
to
the
title
and
immediately
tarnod
was
made
head
gamekeeper
here
what
did
i
tell
you
lord
virzal
i
knew
that
son
of
a
had
something
on
jirzyn
of
starpha
dirzed
exclaimed
a
nice
family
this
of
starpha
well
that
not
the
end
of
it
sarnax
continued
this
morning
tarnov
of
fastor
late
jirzid
of
starpha
went
before
the
high
court
of
estates
and
entered
suit
to
change
his
name
to
jirzid
of
starpha
and
laid
claim
to
the
title
of
starpha
the
case
has
just
been
entered
so
there
been
no
hearing
but
there
the
blazes
of
an
argument
among
all
the
nobles
about
it
some
are
claiming
that
the
individuality
does
change
from
one
reincarnation
to
the
next
and
others
claiming
that
property
and
titles
should
pass
along
the
line
of
physical
descent
no
matter
what
individuality
has
reincarnated
into
what
body
they
the
ones
who
want
the
lady
dallona
discarnated
and
her
discoveries
suppressed
and
there
talk
about
revising
the
entire
system
of
and
oh
it
an
utter
obscenity
of
a
business
this
verkan
vall
told
dalla
is
something
we
will
not
emphasize
when
we
get
home
that
was
as
close
as
he
dared
come
to
it
but
she
caught
his
meaning
the
working
of
major
changes
in
social
structures
was
not
viewed
with
approval
by
the
paratime
commission
on
the
first
level
we
get
home
he
added
then
an
idea
occurred
to
him
dirzed
sarnax
this
place
must
have
been
used
by
the
leaders
of
the
volitionalists
for
conferences
is
there
a
secret
passage
anywhere
sarnax
shook
his
head
not
from
here
there
is
one
on
the
floor
above
but
they
control
it
and
even
if
there
were
one
down
here
they
would
be
guarding
the
outlet
that
what
i
was
counting
on
i
hoped
to
simulate
an
escape
that
way
and
then
make
a
rush
up
the
regular
tubes
verkan
vall
shrugged
i
suppose
marnik
our
only
chance
i
hope
he
got
away
safely
he
was
going
for
help
i
was
surprised
that
an
assassin
would
desert
his
client
i
should
have
thought
of
that
sarnax
said
well
even
if
he
got
down
carnate
and
if
girzad
did
catch
him
he
still
be
afoot
ten
miles
from
the
nearest
city
unit
that
gives
us
a
little
chance
about
one
in
a
thousand
is
there
any
way
they
can
get
at
us
except
by
those
tubes
dalla
asked
they
could
cut
a
hole
in
the
floor
or
burn
one
through
sarnax
replied
they
have
plenty
of
thermite
they
could
detonate
a
charge
of
explosives
over
our
heads
or
clear
out
of
the
dome
and
drop
one
down
the
well
they
could
use
lethal
gas
or
radiodust
but
their
assassins
would
permit
such
illegal
methods
or
they
could
shoot
down
at
us
and
then
come
down
and
cut
our
throats
at
their
leisure
we
have
to
get
out
of
this
room
then
verkan
vall
decided
they
know
we
barricaded
ourselves
in
here
this
is
where
attack
so
we
patrol
the
perimeter
of
the
well
we
be
out
of
danger
from
above
if
we
keep
close
to
the
wall
and
we
inspect
all
the
rooms
on
this
floor
for
evidence
of
cutting
through
from
above
sarnax
nodded
that
sense
lord
virzal
how
about
the
lifter
tubes
we
have
to
barricade
them
sarnax
you
and
dirzed
know
the
layout
of
this
place
better
than
the
lady
dallona
or
i
suppose
you
two
check
the
rooms
while
we
cover
the
tubes
and
the
well
verkan
vall
directed
come
on
now
they
pushed
the
door
and
went
out
past
the
cabinet
hugging
the
wall
they
began
a
slow
circuit
of
the
well
verkan
vall
in
the
lead
with
the
then
sarnax
and
dirzed
the
former
with
a
heavy
and
the
latter
with
a
hunting
pistol
in
each
hand
and
hadron
dalla
brought
up
in
the
rear
with
her
rifle
it
was
she
who
noticed
a
movement
along
the
rim
of
the
balcony
above
and
snapped
a
shot
at
it
there
was
a
crash
above
and
a
shower
of
glass
and
plastic
and
metal
fragments
rattled
on
the
pavement
of
the
court
somebody
had
been
trying
to
lower
a
scanner
or
a
or
something
of
the
sort
the
exact
nature
of
the
instrument
was
not
evident
from
the
wreckage
dalla
bullet
had
made
of
it
the
rooms
dirzed
and
sarnax
entered
were
all
quiet
nobody
seemed
to
be
attempting
to
cut
through
the
ceiling
fifteen
feet
above
they
dragged
furniture
from
a
couple
of
rooms
blocking
the
openings
of
the
lifter
tubes
and
continued
around
the
well
until
they
had
reached
the
gun
room
again
dirzed
suggested
that
they
move
some
of
the
weapons
and
ammunition
stored
there
to
prince
jirzyn
private
apartment
halfway
around
to
the
lifter
tubes
so
that
another
place
of
refuge
would
be
stocked
with
munitions
in
event
of
their
being
driven
from
the
gun
room
leaving
him
on
guard
outside
verkan
vall
dalla
and
sarnax
entered
the
gun
room
and
began
gathering
weapons
and
boxes
of
ammunition
dalla
finished
packing
her
game
bag
with
the
recorded
data
and
notes
of
her
experiments
verkan
vall
selected
four
more
of
the
heavy
hunting
pistols
more
accurate
than
his
weapon
or
the
dead
olirzon
belt
arm
and
capable
of
either
full
or
fire
sarnax
chose
a
couple
more
boar
rifles
dalla
slung
her
bag
of
recorded
notes
and
another
bag
of
ammunition
and
secured
another
deer
rifle
they
carried
this
accumulation
of
munitions
to
the
private
apartments
of
prince
jirzyn
dumping
everything
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
room
except
the
bag
of
notes
from
which
dalla
refused
to
separate
herself
maybe
we
better
put
some
stuff
over
in
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
other
side
of
the
well
dirzed
suggested
they
have
really
begun
to
come
after
us
when
they
do
we
probably
be
attacked
from
two
or
three
directions
at
once
they
returned
to
the
gun
room
casting
anxious
glances
at
the
edge
of
the
balcony
above
and
at
the
barricade
they
had
erected
across
the
openings
to
the
lifter
tubes
verkan
vall
was
not
satisfied
with
this
last
it
looked
to
him
as
though
they
had
provided
a
breastwork
for
somebody
to
fire
on
them
from
more
than
anything
else
he
was
about
to
step
around
the
cabinet
which
partially
blocked
the
door
when
he
glanced
up
and
saw
a
circle
on
the
ceiling
turning
slowly
brown
there
was
a
smell
of
scorched
plastic
he
grabbed
sarnax
by
the
arm
and
pointed
thermite
the
assassin
whispered
the
ceiling
got
six
inches
of
between
it
and
the
floor
above
it
take
them
a
few
minutes
to
burn
through
it
he
stooped
and
pushed
on
the
barricade
shoving
it
into
the
room
keep
back
they
probably
drop
a
grenade
or
so
through
first
before
they
jump
down
if
we
quick
we
can
get
a
couple
of
them
dirzed
and
sarnax
crouched
one
at
either
side
of
the
door
with
weapons
ready
verkan
vall
and
dalla
had
been
ordered
rather
peremptorily
to
stay
behind
them
in
a
place
of
danger
an
assassin
was
obliged
to
shield
his
client
verkan
vall
unable
to
see
what
was
going
on
inside
the
room
kept
his
eyes
and
his
gun
muzzle
on
the
barricade
across
the
openings
to
the
lifter
tubes
the
erection
of
which
he
was
now
regretting
as
a
major
tactical
error
inside
the
gun
room
there
was
a
sudden
crash
as
the
circle
of
thermite
burned
through
and
a
section
of
ceiling
dropped
out
and
hit
the
floor
instantly
dirzed
flung
himself
back
against
verkan
vall
and
there
was
a
tremendous
explosion
inside
followed
by
another
and
another
a
second
or
so
passed
then
dirzed
leaning
around
the
corner
of
the
door
began
firing
rapidly
into
the
room
from
the
other
side
of
the
door
sarnax
began
blazing
away
with
his
rifle
verkan
vall
kept
his
position
covering
the
lifter
tubes
suddenly
from
behind
the
barricade
a
gun
flash
leaped
into
being
and
a
pistol
banged
he
sprayed
the
opening
between
a
couch
and
a
section
of
bookcase
from
whence
it
had
come
releasing
his
trigger
as
the
gun
rose
with
the
recoil
squeezing
and
releasing
and
squeezing
again
then
he
jumped
to
his
feet
come
on
the
other
place
hurry
he
ordered
sarnax
swore
in
exasperation
help
me
with
her
dirzed
he
implored
verkan
vall
turned
his
head
to
see
the
two
assassins
drag
dalla
to
her
feet
and
hustle
her
away
from
the
gun
room
she
was
quite
senseless
and
they
had
to
drag
her
between
them
verkan
vall
gave
a
quick
glance
into
the
gun
room
two
of
the
starpha
servants
and
a
man
in
rather
flashy
civil
dress
were
lying
on
the
floor
where
they
had
been
shot
as
they
had
jumped
down
from
above
he
saw
a
movement
at
the
edge
of
the
irregular
smoking
hole
in
the
ceiling
and
gave
it
a
short
burst
then
fired
another
at
the
exit
from
the
descent
tube
then
he
took
to
his
heels
and
followed
the
assassins
and
hadron
dalla
into
prince
jirzyn
apartment
as
he
ran
through
the
open
door
the
assassins
were
letting
dalla
down
into
a
chair
they
instantly
threw
themselves
into
the
work
of
barricading
the
doorway
so
as
to
provide
cover
and
at
the
same
time
allow
them
to
fire
out
into
the
central
well
illustration
for
an
instant
as
he
bent
over
her
he
thought
dalla
had
been
killed
an
assumption
justified
by
his
knowledge
of
the
deadliness
of
bullets
then
he
saw
her
flicker
a
moment
later
he
had
the
explanation
of
her
escape
the
bullet
had
hit
the
game
bag
at
her
side
it
was
full
of
spools
of
metal
tape
in
metal
cases
and
notes
in
written
form
pyrographed
upon
sheets
of
plastic
ring
fastened
into
metal
binders
because
of
their
extreme
velocity
bullets
were
sure
killers
when
they
struck
animal
tissue
but
for
the
same
reason
they
had
very
poor
penetration
on
hard
objects
the
tape
and
the
steel
spools
and
spool
cases
and
the
notebook
binders
had
been
enough
to
shatter
the
little
bullet
into
splinters
of
alloy
and
the
stout
leather
back
of
the
game
bag
had
stopped
all
of
these
but
the
impact
even
distributed
as
it
had
been
through
the
contents
of
the
bag
had
been
enough
to
knock
the
girl
unconscious
he
found
a
bottle
of
some
sort
of
brandy
and
a
glass
on
a
serving
table
nearby
and
poured
her
a
drink
holding
it
to
her
lips
she
spluttered
over
the
first
mouthful
then
took
the
glass
from
him
and
sipped
the
rest
what
happened
she
asked
i
thought
those
bullets
were
sure
death
your
notes
the
bullet
hit
the
bag
are
you
all
right
now
she
finished
the
brandy
i
think
so
she
put
a
hand
into
the
game
bag
and
brought
out
a
snarled
and
tangled
mess
of
steel
tape
oh
that
stuff
was
important
all
the
records
on
the
preliminary
experiments
she
shrugged
well
it
would
have
been
worth
much
more
if
i
stopped
that
bullet
myself
she
slipped
the
strap
over
her
shoulder
and
started
to
rise
as
she
did
a
bedlam
of
firing
broke
out
both
from
the
two
assassins
at
the
door
and
from
outside
they
both
hit
the
floor
and
crawled
out
of
line
of
the
door
verkan
vall
recovered
his
which
he
had
set
down
beside
dalla
chair
sarnax
was
firing
with
his
rifle
at
some
target
in
the
direction
of
the
lifter
tubes
dirzed
lay
slumped
over
the
barricade
and
one
glance
at
his
crumpled
figure
was
enough
to
tell
verkan
vall
that
he
was
dead
you
fill
magazines
for
us
he
told
dalla
then
crawled
to
place
at
the
door
what
happened
sarnax
they
shoved
over
the
barricade
at
the
lifter
tubes
and
came
out
into
the
well
i
got
a
couple
they
got
dirzed
and
now
they
holed
up
in
rooms
all
around
the
circle
they
aah
he
fired
three
shots
quickly
around
the
edge
of
the
door
that
stopped
that
the
assassin
crouched
to
insert
a
fresh
magazine
into
his
rifle
illustration
verkan
vall
risked
one
eye
around
the
corner
of
the
doorway
and
as
he
did
there
was
a
red
flash
and
a
dull
roar
unlike
the
blue
flashes
and
sharp
cracking
reports
of
the
pistols
and
rifles
from
the
doorway
of
the
gun
room
he
wondered
for
a
split
second
if
it
might
be
one
of
the
fowling
pieces
he
had
seen
there
and
then
something
whizzed
past
his
head
and
exploded
with
a
soft
behind
him
turning
he
saw
a
pool
of
gray
vapor
beginning
to
spread
in
the
middle
of
the
room
dalla
must
have
got
a
breath
of
it
for
she
was
slumped
over
the
chair
from
which
she
had
just
risen
dropping
the
and
gulping
a
lungful
of
fresh
air
from
outside
verkan
vall
rushed
to
her
caught
her
by
the
heels
and
dragged
her
into
prince
jirzyn
bedroom
beyond
leaving
her
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
took
another
deep
breath
and
returned
to
the
drawing
room
where
sarnax
was
already
overcome
by
the
he
saw
the
serving
table
from
which
he
had
got
the
brandy
and
dragged
it
over
to
the
bedroom
door
overturning
it
and
laying
it
across
the
doorway
its
legs
in
the
air
like
most
serving
tables
it
had
a
unit
under
it
he
set
this
for
double
and
snapped
it
on
as
it
was
now
above
the
inverted
table
the
table
did
not
rise
but
a
tendril
of
curling
toward
it
bent
upward
and
drifted
away
from
the
doorway
satisfied
that
he
had
made
a
temporary
barrier
against
the
verkan
vall
secured
dalla
hunting
pistol
and
spare
magazines
and
lay
down
at
the
bedroom
door
for
some
time
there
was
silence
outside
then
the
besiegers
evidently
decided
that
the
attack
had
been
a
success
an
assassin
wearing
a
gas
mask
and
carrying
a
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
behind
him
came
a
tall
man
in
a
tan
tunic
similarly
masked
they
stepped
into
the
room
and
looked
around
knowing
that
he
would
be
shooting
over
a
two
hundred
percent
negative
verkan
vall
aimed
for
the
assassin
and
squeezed
the
bullet
caught
him
in
the
throat
evidently
the
bullet
had
not
only
been
lifted
in
the
negative
gravitation
but
lifted
and
deflected
upward
he
held
his
front
sight
just
above
the
other
man
knee
and
hit
him
in
the
chest
as
he
fired
he
saw
a
wisp
of
gas
come
sliding
around
the
edge
of
the
inverted
table
there
was
silence
outside
and
for
an
instant
he
was
tempted
to
abandon
his
post
and
go
to
the
bathroom
back
of
the
bedroom
for
wet
towels
to
improvise
a
mask
then
when
he
tried
to
crawl
backward
he
could
not
there
was
an
impression
of
distant
shouting
which
turned
to
a
roaring
sound
in
his
head
he
tried
to
lift
his
pistol
but
it
slipped
from
his
fingers
when
consciousness
returned
he
was
lying
on
his
back
and
something
cold
and
rubbery
was
pressing
into
his
face
he
raised
his
arms
to
fight
off
whatever
it
was
and
opened
his
eyes
to
find
that
he
was
staring
directly
at
the
red
oval
and
winged
bullet
of
the
society
of
assassins
a
hand
caught
his
wrist
as
he
reached
for
the
small
pistol
under
his
arm
the
pressure
on
his
face
eased
it
all
right
lord
virzal
a
voice
came
to
him
truce
he
nodded
stupidly
and
repeated
the
words
assassins
truce
i
shoot
what
happened
then
he
sat
up
and
looked
around
prince
jirzyn
bedchamber
was
full
of
assassins
dalla
recovering
from
her
touch
of
was
sitting
groggily
in
a
chair
while
five
or
six
of
them
fussed
around
her
getting
in
each
others
way
handing
her
drinks
chaffing
her
wrists
holding
damp
cloths
on
her
brow
that
was
standard
procedure
when
any
group
of
males
thought
dalla
needed
any
help
another
assassin
beside
the
bed
was
putting
away
an
outfit
and
the
assassin
who
had
prevented
verkan
vall
from
drawing
his
pistol
was
his
own
follower
marnik
and
klarnood
the
was
sitting
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
smoking
one
of
prince
monogrammed
and
crested
cigarettes
critically
verkan
vall
looked
at
marnik
and
then
at
klarnood
and
back
to
marnik
you
got
through
he
said
good
work
marnik
i
thought
downed
you
they
did
i
had
to
in
the
woods
i
went
about
a
mile
on
foot
and
then
i
found
a
man
and
woman
and
two
children
hiding
in
one
of
these
little
log
rain
shelters
they
had
an
airboat
a
good
one
it
seemed
that
rioting
had
broken
out
in
the
city
unit
where
they
lived
and
they
taken
to
the
woods
till
things
quieted
down
again
i
offered
them
assassins
protection
if
they
take
me
to
hall
and
they
did
by
luck
i
was
in
when
marnik
arrived
klarnood
took
over
we
brought
three
boatloads
of
men
and
came
here
at
once
just
as
we
got
here
two
boatloads
of
starpha
dependents
arrived
they
tried
to
give
us
an
argument
and
we
discarnated
the
lot
of
them
then
we
came
down
here
crying
assassins
truce
one
of
the
starpha
assassins
kirzol
was
still
carnate
he
told
us
what
had
been
going
on
the
grim
you
know
i
take
a
rather
poor
view
of
prince
jirzyn
procedure
in
this
matter
not
to
mention
that
of
his
underlings
i
have
to
speak
to
him
about
this
now
how
about
you
and
the
lady
dallona
what
do
you
intend
doing
we
getting
out
of
here
verkan
vall
said
i
like
air
transport
and
protection
as
far
as
ghamma
to
the
establishment
of
the
family
of
zorda
brarnend
of
zorda
has
a
private
space
yacht
he
get
us
to
venus
klarnood
gave
a
sigh
of
obvious
relief
i
have
you
and
the
lady
dallona
airborne
and
off
for
ghamma
as
soon
as
you
wish
he
promised
i
will
frankly
be
delighted
to
see
the
last
of
both
of
you
the
lady
dallona
has
started
a
fire
here
at
darsh
that
wo
burn
out
in
a
and
who
knows
what
it
may
consume
he
was
interrupted
by
a
heaving
shock
that
made
the
underground
dome
dwelling
shake
like
a
light
airboat
in
turbulence
even
eighty
feet
under
the
ground
they
could
hear
a
continued
crashing
roar
it
was
an
appreciable
interval
before
the
sound
and
the
shock
ceased
for
an
instant
there
was
silence
and
then
an
excited
bedlam
of
shouting
broke
from
the
assassins
in
the
room
klarnood
face
was
frozen
in
horror
that
was
a
fission
bomb
he
exclaimed
the
first
one
that
has
been
exploded
on
this
planet
in
hostility
in
a
thousand
years
he
turned
to
verkan
vall
if
you
feel
well
enough
to
walk
lord
virzal
come
with
us
i
must
see
what
happened
they
hurried
from
the
room
and
went
streaming
up
the
ascent
tube
to
the
top
of
the
dome
about
forty
miles
away
to
the
south
verkan
vall
saw
the
sinister
thing
that
he
had
seen
on
so
many
other
in
so
many
other
paratime
sectors
a
great
pillar
of
varicolored
smoke
rising
to
a
mushroom
head
fifty
thousand
feet
above
well
that
it
klarnood
said
sadly
that
is
civil
war
may
i
make
a
suggestion
verkan
vall
asked
i
understand
that
assassins
truce
is
binding
even
upon
is
that
correct
well
not
exactly
it
generally
kept
by
such
as
want
to
remain
in
their
present
reincarnations
though
that
what
i
meant
well
suppose
you
declare
a
general
assassins
truce
in
this
political
war
and
make
the
leaders
of
both
parties
responsible
for
keeping
it
publish
lists
of
the
top
two
or
three
thousand
statisticalists
and
volitionalists
starting
with
mirzark
of
bashad
and
prince
jirzyn
of
starpha
and
inform
them
that
they
will
be
assassinated
in
order
if
the
fighting
does
cease
well
a
smile
grew
on
klarnood
face
lord
virzal
my
thanks
a
good
suggestion
i
try
it
and
furthermore
i
withdraw
all
assassin
protection
permanently
from
anybody
involved
in
political
activity
and
forbid
any
assassin
to
accept
any
retainer
connected
with
political
factionalism
it
about
time
our
members
stopped
discarnating
each
other
in
these
political
squabbles
he
pointed
to
the
three
airboats
drawn
up
on
the
top
of
the
dome
speedy
black
craft
bearing
the
red
oval
and
winged
bullet
take
your
choice
lord
virzal
i
lend
you
a
couple
of
my
men
and
you
be
in
ghamma
in
three
hours
he
hooked
fingers
and
clapped
shoulders
with
verkan
vall
bent
over
dalla
hand
i
still
like
you
lord
virzal
and
i
have
seldom
met
a
more
charming
lady
than
you
lady
dallona
but
i
sincerely
hope
i
never
see
either
of
you
again
the
ship
for
dhergabar
was
driving
north
and
west
at
seventy
thousand
feet
it
was
still
daylight
but
the
world
below
was
wrapping
itself
in
darkness
in
the
big
visiscreens
which
served
in
lieu
of
the
windows
which
could
never
have
withstood
the
pressure
and
friction
heat
of
the
ship
speed
the
sun
was
sliding
out
of
sight
over
the
horizon
to
port
verkan
vall
and
dalla
sat
together
watching
the
blazing
western
sky
the
sky
of
their
own
first
level
i
blame
myself
terribly
vall
dalla
was
saying
and
i
did
mean
any
of
them
the
least
harm
all
i
was
interested
in
was
learning
the
facts
i
know
that
sounds
like
did
know
it
was
loaded
but
it
sounds
to
me
like
those
fourth
level
sector
physicists
who
are
giving
themselves
because
they
designed
an
atomic
bomb
verkan
vall
replied
all
you
were
interested
in
was
learning
the
facts
well
as
a
scientist
that
all
you
supposed
to
be
interested
in
you
do
have
to
worry
about
any
social
or
political
implications
people
have
to
learn
to
live
with
facts
if
they
do
they
die
of
them
but
vall
that
sounds
dreadfully
irresponsible
does
it
you
worrying
about
the
results
of
your
reincarnation
discoveries
the
shootings
and
riotings
and
the
bombing
we
saw
he
touched
the
pommel
of
olirzon
knife
which
he
still
wore
you
no
more
guilty
of
that
than
the
man
who
forged
this
blade
is
guilty
of
the
death
of
marnark
of
bashad
if
he
never
lived
i
have
killed
marnark
with
some
other
knife
somebody
else
made
and
what
more
you
ca
know
the
results
of
your
discoveries
all
you
can
see
is
a
thin
film
of
events
on
the
surface
of
an
immediate
situation
so
you
ca
say
whether
the
results
will
be
beneficial
or
calamitous
take
this
fourth
level
atomic
bomb
for
example
i
choose
that
because
we
both
know
that
sector
but
i
could
think
of
a
hundred
other
examples
in
other
paratime
areas
those
people
because
of
deforestation
bad
agricultural
methods
and
general
mismanagement
are
eroding
away
their
arable
soil
at
an
alarming
rate
at
the
same
time
they
are
breeding
like
rabbits
in
other
words
each
successive
generation
has
less
and
less
food
to
divide
among
more
and
more
people
and
for
inherited
traditional
and
superstitious
reasons
they
refuse
to
adopt
any
rational
program
of
and
but
fortunately
they
now
have
the
atomic
bomb
and
they
are
developing
radioactive
poisons
weapons
of
and
their
racial
nationalistic
and
ideological
conflicts
are
rapidly
reaching
the
explosion
point
a
series
of
atomic
wars
is
just
what
that
sector
needs
to
bring
their
population
down
to
their
world
carrying
capacity
in
a
century
or
so
the
inventors
of
the
atomic
bomb
will
be
hailed
as
the
saviors
of
their
species
but
how
about
my
work
on
the
sector
dalla
asked
it
seems
that
my
technique
is
more
explosive
than
any
fission
bomb
i
laid
the
train
for
a
reign
of
anarchy
i
doubt
that
i
think
klarnood
will
take
hold
now
that
he
has
committed
himself
to
it
you
know
in
spite
of
his
sanguinary
profession
he
the
nearest
thing
to
a
real
man
of
good
will
found
on
that
sector
and
here
something
else
you
considered
our
own
first
level
life
expectancy
is
from
four
to
five
hundred
years
that
the
main
reason
why
we
accomplished
as
much
as
we
have
we
have
individually
time
to
accomplish
things
on
the
sector
a
scientist
or
artist
or
scholar
or
statesman
will
grow
senile
and
die
before
he
as
old
as
either
of
us
but
now
a
young
student
of
twenty
or
so
can
take
one
of
your
treatments
and
immediately
have
available
all
the
knowledge
and
experience
gained
in
four
or
five
previous
lives
he
can
start
where
he
left
off
in
his
last
reincarnation
in
other
words
you
made
those
people
individually
as
well
as
racially
that
worth
the
temporary
discarnation
of
a
lot
of
and
or
even
a
few
decent
types
like
dirzed
and
olirzon
if
it
is
i
do
know
what
scales
of
values
you
using
vall
dalla
eyes
glowed
with
enthusiasm
i
never
thought
of
that
and
you
said
discarnation
that
just
what
it
is
dirzed
and
olirzon
and
the
others
are
dead
they
just
waiting
discarnate
between
physical
lives
you
know
in
the
sacred
writings
of
one
of
the
fourth
level
peoples
it
is
stated
is
the
last
enemy
by
proving
that
death
is
just
a
cyclic
condition
of
continued
individual
existence
these
people
have
conquered
their
last
enemy
last
enemy
but
one
verkan
vall
corrected
they
still
have
one
enemy
to
go
an
enemy
within
themselves
call
it
semantic
confusion
or
illogic
or
incomprehension
or
just
plain
stupidity
like
klarnood
stymied
by
verbal
objections
to
something
labeled
intervention
he
never
have
consented
to
use
the
power
of
his
society
if
he
had
been
shocked
out
of
his
inhibitions
by
that
nuclear
bomb
or
the
statisticalists
trying
to
create
a
classless
order
of
society
through
a
political
program
which
would
only
result
in
universal
servitude
to
an
omnipotent
government
or
the
volitionalist
nobles
trying
to
preserve
their
hereditary
feudal
privileges
and
now
they
ca
even
agree
on
a
definition
of
the
term
might
they
not
recover
all
the
silly
prejudices
of
their
past
lives
along
with
the
knowledge
and
wisdom
but
i
thought
you
said
dalla
was
puzzled
a
little
hurt
verkan
vall
arm
squeezed
around
her
waist
and
he
laughed
comfortingly
you
see
any
sort
of
result
is
possible
good
or
bad
so
do
blame
yourself
in
advance
for
something
you
ca
possibly
estimate
an
idea
occurred
to
him
and
he
straightened
in
the
seat
tell
you
what
if
you
people
at
rhogom
foundation
get
the
problem
of
discarnate
paratime
transposition
licked
by
then
let
you
and
i
go
back
to
the
sector
in
about
a
hundred
years
and
see
what
sort
of
a
mess
those
people
have
made
of
things
a
hundred
years
that
would
be
year
of
the
next
millennium
it
a
date
vall
we
do
it
they
bent
to
light
their
cigarettes
together
at
his
lighter
when
they
raised
their
heads
again
and
got
the
flame
glare
out
of
their
eyes
the
sky
was
dusted
with
stars
and
dead
ahead
spilling
up
over
the
horizon
was
a
golden
glow
the
lights
of
dhergabar
and
home
