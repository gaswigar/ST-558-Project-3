homage
and
remembrances
of
the
author
a
drama
on
the
seashore
nearly
all
young
men
have
a
compass
with
which
they
delight
in
measuring
the
future
when
their
will
is
equal
to
the
breadth
of
the
angle
at
which
they
open
it
the
world
is
theirs
but
this
phenomenon
of
the
inner
life
takes
place
only
at
a
certain
age
that
age
which
for
all
men
lies
between
and
is
the
period
of
great
thoughts
of
fresh
conceptions
because
it
is
the
age
of
immense
desires
after
that
age
short
as
the
comes
that
of
execution
there
are
as
it
were
two
youths
the
youth
of
belief
the
youth
of
action
these
are
often
commingled
in
men
whom
nature
has
favored
and
who
like
caesar
like
newton
like
bonaparte
are
the
greatest
among
great
men
i
was
measuring
how
long
a
time
it
might
take
a
thought
to
develop
compass
in
hand
standing
on
a
rock
some
hundred
fathoms
above
the
ocean
the
waves
of
which
were
breaking
on
the
reef
below
i
surveyed
my
future
filling
it
with
books
as
an
engineer
or
builder
traces
on
vacant
ground
a
palace
or
a
fort
the
sea
was
beautiful
i
had
just
dressed
after
bathing
and
i
awaited
pauline
who
was
also
bathing
in
a
granite
cove
floored
with
fine
sand
the
most
coquettish
that
nature
ever
devised
for
her
the
spot
was
at
the
farther
end
of
croisic
a
dainty
little
peninsula
in
brittany
it
was
far
from
the
port
and
so
inaccessible
that
the
seldom
thought
it
necessary
to
pass
that
way
to
float
in
ether
after
floating
on
the
wave
ah
who
would
not
have
floated
on
the
future
as
i
did
why
was
i
thinking
whence
comes
evil
who
knows
ideas
drop
into
our
hearts
or
into
our
heads
without
consulting
us
no
courtesan
was
ever
more
capricious
nor
more
imperious
than
conception
is
to
artists
we
must
grasp
it
like
fortune
by
the
hair
when
it
comes
astride
upon
my
thought
like
astolphe
on
his
hippogriff
i
was
galloping
through
worlds
suiting
them
to
my
fancy
presently
as
i
looked
about
me
to
find
some
omen
for
the
bold
productions
my
wild
imagination
was
urging
me
to
undertake
a
pretty
cry
the
cry
of
a
woman
issuing
refreshed
and
joyous
from
a
bath
rose
above
the
murmur
of
the
rippling
fringes
as
their
flux
and
reflux
marked
a
white
line
along
the
shore
hearing
that
note
as
it
gushed
from
a
soul
i
fancied
i
saw
among
the
rocks
the
foot
of
an
angel
who
with
outspread
wings
cried
out
to
me
thou
shalt
succeed
i
came
down
radiant
i
bounded
like
a
pebble
rolling
down
a
rapid
slope
when
she
saw
me
she
said
what
is
it
i
did
not
answer
my
eyes
were
moist
the
night
before
pauline
had
understood
my
sorrows
as
she
now
understood
my
joy
with
the
magical
sensitiveness
of
a
harp
that
obeys
the
variations
of
the
atmosphere
human
life
has
glorious
moments
together
we
walked
in
silence
along
the
beach
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
sea
without
a
ripple
others
might
have
thought
them
merely
two
blue
surfaces
the
one
above
the
other
but
we
we
who
heard
without
the
need
of
words
we
who
could
evoke
between
these
two
infinitudes
the
illusions
that
nourish
youth
we
pressed
each
other
hands
at
every
change
in
the
sheet
of
water
or
the
sheets
of
air
for
we
took
those
slight
phenomena
as
the
visible
translation
of
our
double
thought
who
has
never
tasted
in
wedded
love
that
moment
of
illimitable
joy
when
the
soul
seems
freed
from
the
trammels
of
flesh
and
finds
itself
restored
as
it
were
to
the
world
whence
it
came
are
there
not
hours
when
feelings
clasp
each
other
and
fly
upward
like
children
taking
hands
and
running
they
scarce
know
why
it
was
thus
we
went
along
at
the
moment
when
the
village
roofs
began
to
show
like
a
faint
gray
line
on
the
horizon
we
met
a
fisherman
a
poor
man
returning
to
croisic
his
feet
were
bare
his
linen
trousers
ragged
round
the
bottom
his
shirt
of
common
sailcloth
and
his
jacket
tatters
this
abject
poverty
pained
us
it
was
like
a
discord
amid
our
harmonies
we
looked
at
each
other
grieving
mutually
that
we
had
not
at
that
moment
the
power
to
dip
into
the
treasury
of
aboul
casem
but
we
saw
a
splendid
lobster
and
a
crab
fastened
to
a
string
which
the
fisherman
was
dangling
in
his
right
hand
while
with
the
left
he
held
his
tackle
and
his
net
we
accosted
him
with
the
intention
of
buying
his
haul
an
idea
which
came
to
us
both
and
was
expressed
in
a
smile
to
which
i
responded
by
a
slight
pressure
of
the
arm
i
held
and
drew
toward
my
heart
it
was
one
of
those
nothings
of
which
memory
makes
poems
when
we
sit
by
the
fire
and
recall
the
hour
when
that
nothing
moved
us
and
the
place
where
it
did
so
a
mirage
the
effects
of
which
have
never
been
noted
down
though
it
appears
on
the
objects
that
surround
us
in
moments
when
life
sits
lightly
and
our
hearts
are
full
the
loveliest
scenery
is
that
we
make
ourselves
what
man
with
any
poesy
in
him
does
not
remember
some
mere
mass
of
rock
which
holds
it
may
be
a
greater
place
in
his
memory
than
the
celebrated
landscapes
of
other
lands
sought
at
great
cost
beside
that
rock
tumultuous
thoughts
there
a
whole
life
evolved
there
all
fears
dispersed
there
the
rays
of
hope
descended
to
the
soul
at
this
moment
the
sun
sympathizing
with
these
thoughts
of
love
and
of
the
future
had
cast
an
ardent
glow
upon
the
savage
flanks
of
the
rock
a
few
wild
mountain
flowers
were
visible
the
stillness
and
the
silence
magnified
that
rugged
pile
really
sombre
though
tinted
by
the
dreamer
and
beautiful
beneath
its
scanty
vegetation
the
warm
chamomile
the
venus
tresses
with
their
velvet
leaves
oh
lingering
festival
oh
glorious
decorations
oh
happy
exaltation
of
human
forces
once
already
the
lake
of
brienne
had
spoken
to
me
thus
the
rock
of
croisic
may
be
perhaps
the
last
of
these
my
joys
if
so
what
will
become
of
pauline
have
you
had
a
good
catch
my
man
i
said
to
the
fisherman
yes
monsieur
he
replied
stopping
and
turning
toward
us
the
swarthy
face
of
those
who
spend
whole
days
exposed
to
the
reflection
of
the
sun
upon
the
water
that
face
was
an
emblem
of
long
resignation
of
the
patience
of
a
fisherman
and
his
quiet
ways
the
man
had
a
voice
without
harshness
kind
lips
evidently
no
ambition
and
something
frail
and
puny
about
him
any
other
sort
of
countenance
would
at
that
moment
have
jarred
upon
us
where
shall
you
sell
your
fish
in
the
town
how
much
will
they
pay
you
for
that
lobster
fifteen
sous
and
the
crab
twenty
sous
why
so
much
difference
between
a
lobster
and
a
crab
monsieur
the
crab
is
much
more
delicate
eating
besides
it
as
malicious
as
a
monkey
and
it
seldom
lets
you
catch
it
will
you
let
us
buy
the
two
for
a
hundred
sous
asked
pauline
the
man
seemed
petrified
you
shall
not
have
it
i
said
to
her
laughing
i
pay
ten
francs
we
should
count
the
emotions
in
very
well
she
said
then
i
pay
ten
francs
two
sous
ten
francs
ten
sous
twelve
francs
fifteen
francs
fifteen
francs
fifty
centimes
she
said
one
hundred
francs
one
hundred
and
fifty
francs
i
yielded
we
were
not
rich
enough
at
that
moment
to
bid
higher
our
poor
fisherman
did
not
know
whether
to
be
angry
at
a
hoax
or
to
go
mad
with
joy
we
drew
him
from
his
quandary
by
giving
him
the
name
of
our
landlady
and
telling
him
to
take
the
lobster
and
the
crab
to
her
house
do
you
earn
enough
to
live
on
i
asked
the
man
in
order
to
discover
the
cause
of
his
evident
penury
with
great
hardships
and
always
poorly
he
replied
fishing
on
the
coast
when
one
has
a
boat
or
nets
nothing
but
pole
and
line
is
a
very
uncertain
business
you
see
we
have
to
wait
for
the
fish
or
the
whereas
a
real
fisherman
puts
out
to
sea
for
them
it
is
so
hard
to
earn
a
living
this
way
that
i
the
only
man
in
these
parts
who
fishes
i
spend
whole
days
without
getting
anything
to
catch
a
crab
it
must
go
to
sleep
as
this
one
did
and
a
lobster
must
be
silly
enough
to
stay
among
the
rocks
sometimes
after
a
high
tide
the
mussels
come
in
and
i
grab
them
well
taking
one
day
with
another
how
much
do
you
earn
oh
eleven
or
twelve
sous
i
could
do
with
that
if
i
were
alone
but
i
have
got
my
old
father
to
keep
and
he
ca
do
anything
the
good
man
because
he
blind
at
these
words
said
simply
pauline
and
i
looked
at
each
other
without
a
word
then
i
asked
have
you
a
wife
or
some
good
friend
he
cast
upon
us
one
of
the
most
lamentable
glances
that
i
ever
saw
as
he
answered
if
i
had
a
wife
i
must
abandon
my
father
i
could
not
feed
him
and
a
wife
and
children
too
well
my
poor
lad
why
do
you
try
to
earn
more
at
the
salt
marshes
or
by
carrying
the
salt
to
the
harbor
ah
monsieur
i
could
do
that
work
three
months
i
am
not
strong
enough
and
if
i
died
my
father
would
have
to
beg
i
am
forced
to
take
a
business
which
only
needs
a
little
knack
and
a
great
deal
of
patience
but
how
can
two
persons
live
on
twelve
sous
a
day
oh
monsieur
we
eat
cakes
made
of
buckwheat
and
barnacles
which
i
get
off
the
rocks
how
old
are
you
did
you
ever
leave
croisic
i
went
once
to
guerande
to
draw
for
the
conscription
and
i
went
to
savenay
to
the
messieurs
who
measure
for
the
army
if
i
had
been
half
an
inch
taller
they
have
made
me
a
soldier
i
should
have
died
of
my
first
march
and
my
poor
father
would
be
begging
his
bread
i
had
thought
out
many
dramas
pauline
was
accustomed
to
great
emotions
beside
a
man
so
suffering
as
myself
well
never
had
either
of
us
listened
to
words
so
moving
as
these
we
walked
on
in
silence
measuring
each
of
us
the
silent
depths
of
that
obscure
life
admiring
the
nobility
of
a
devotion
which
was
ignorant
of
itself
the
strength
of
that
feebleness
amazed
us
the
man
unconscious
generosity
belittled
us
i
saw
that
poor
being
of
instinct
chained
to
that
rock
like
a
to
his
ball
watching
through
twenty
years
for
to
earn
a
living
and
sustained
in
his
patience
by
a
single
sentiment
how
many
hours
wasted
on
a
lonely
shore
how
many
hopes
defeated
by
a
change
of
weather
he
was
hanging
there
to
a
granite
rock
his
arm
extended
like
that
of
an
indian
fakir
while
his
father
sitting
in
their
hovel
awaited
in
silence
and
darkness
a
meal
of
the
coarsest
bread
and
if
the
sea
permitted
do
you
ever
drink
wine
i
asked
three
or
four
times
a
year
he
replied
well
you
shall
drink
it
you
and
your
father
and
we
will
send
you
some
white
bread
you
are
very
kind
monsieur
we
will
give
you
your
dinner
if
you
will
show
us
the
way
along
the
shore
to
batz
where
we
wish
to
see
the
tower
which
overlooks
the
bay
between
batz
and
croisic
with
pleasure
he
said
go
straight
before
you
along
the
path
you
are
now
on
and
i
will
follow
you
when
i
have
put
away
my
tackle
we
nodded
consent
and
he
ran
off
joyfully
toward
the
town
this
meeting
maintained
us
in
our
previous
mental
condition
but
it
lessened
our
gay
lightheartedness
poor
man
said
pauline
with
that
accent
which
removes
from
the
compassion
of
a
woman
all
that
is
mortifying
in
human
pity
ought
we
not
to
feel
ashamed
of
our
happiness
in
presence
of
such
misery
nothing
is
so
cruelly
painful
as
to
have
powerless
desires
i
answered
those
two
poor
creatures
the
father
and
son
will
never
know
how
keen
our
sympathy
for
them
is
any
more
than
the
world
will
know
how
beautiful
are
their
lives
they
are
laying
up
their
treasures
in
heaven
oh
how
poor
this
country
is
she
said
pointing
to
a
field
enclosed
by
a
dry
stone
wall
which
was
covered
with
droppings
of
cow
dung
applied
symmetrically
i
asked
a
who
was
busy
sticking
them
on
why
it
was
done
she
answered
that
she
was
making
fuel
could
you
have
imagined
that
when
those
patches
of
dung
have
dried
human
beings
would
collect
them
store
them
and
use
them
for
fuel
during
the
winter
they
are
even
sold
as
peat
is
sold
and
what
do
you
suppose
the
best
dressmaker
in
the
place
can
earn
five
sous
a
day
adding
after
a
pause
and
her
food
but
see
i
said
how
the
winds
from
the
sea
bend
or
destroy
everything
there
are
no
trees
fragments
of
wreckage
or
old
vessels
that
are
broken
up
are
sold
to
those
who
can
afford
to
buy
for
costs
of
transportation
are
too
heavy
to
allow
them
to
use
the
firewood
with
which
brittany
abounds
this
region
is
fine
for
none
but
noble
souls
persons
without
sentiments
could
never
live
here
poets
and
barnacles
alone
should
inhabit
it
all
that
ever
brought
a
population
to
this
rock
were
the
and
the
factory
which
prepares
the
salt
on
one
side
the
sea
on
the
other
sand
above
illimitable
space
we
had
now
passed
the
town
and
had
reached
the
species
of
desert
which
separates
croisic
from
the
village
of
batz
imagine
my
dear
uncle
a
barren
track
of
miles
covered
with
the
glittering
sand
of
the
seashore
here
and
there
a
few
rocks
lifted
their
heads
you
might
have
thought
them
gigantic
animals
couchant
on
the
dunes
along
the
coast
were
reefs
around
which
the
water
foamed
and
sparkled
giving
them
the
appearance
of
great
white
roses
floating
on
the
liquid
surface
or
resting
on
the
shore
seeing
this
barren
tract
with
the
ocean
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
the
arm
of
the
sea
which
runs
up
between
croisic
and
the
rocky
shore
of
guerande
at
the
base
of
which
lay
the
salt
marshes
denuded
of
vegetation
i
looked
at
pauline
and
asked
her
if
she
felt
the
courage
to
face
the
burning
sun
and
the
strength
to
walk
through
sand
i
have
boots
she
said
let
us
go
and
she
pointed
to
the
tower
of
batz
which
arrested
the
eye
by
its
immense
pile
placed
there
like
a
pyramid
but
a
slender
delicately
outlined
pyramid
a
pyramid
so
poetically
ornate
that
the
imagination
figured
in
it
the
earliest
ruin
of
a
great
asiatic
city
we
advanced
a
few
steps
and
sat
down
upon
the
portion
of
a
large
rock
which
was
still
in
the
shade
but
it
was
now
eleven
and
the
shadow
which
ceased
at
our
feet
was
disappearing
rapidly
how
beautiful
this
silence
she
said
to
me
and
how
the
depth
of
it
is
deepened
by
the
rhythmic
quiver
of
the
wave
upon
the
shore
if
you
will
give
your
understanding
to
the
three
immensities
which
surround
us
the
water
the
air
and
the
sands
and
listen
exclusively
to
the
repeating
sounds
of
flux
and
reflux
i
answered
her
you
will
not
be
able
to
endure
their
speech
you
will
think
it
is
uttering
a
thought
which
will
annihilate
you
last
evening
at
sunset
i
had
that
sensation
and
it
exhausted
me
oh
let
us
talk
let
us
talk
she
said
after
a
long
pause
i
understand
it
no
orator
was
ever
more
terrible
i
think
she
continued
presently
that
i
perceive
the
causes
of
the
harmonies
which
surround
us
this
landscape
which
has
but
three
marked
colors
the
brilliant
yellow
of
the
sands
the
blue
of
the
sky
the
even
green
of
the
sea
is
grand
without
being
savage
it
is
immense
yet
not
a
desert
it
is
monotonous
but
it
does
not
weary
it
has
only
three
elements
and
yet
it
is
varied
women
alone
know
how
to
render
such
impressions
i
said
you
would
be
the
despair
of
a
poet
dear
soul
that
i
divine
so
well
the
extreme
heat
of
casts
into
those
three
expressions
of
the
infinite
an
color
said
pauline
smiling
i
can
here
conceive
the
poesy
and
the
passion
of
the
east
and
i
can
perceive
its
despair
yes
she
said
this
dune
is
a
cloister
a
sublime
cloister
we
now
heard
the
hurried
steps
of
our
guide
he
had
put
on
his
sunday
clothes
we
addressed
a
few
ordinary
words
to
him
he
seemed
to
think
that
our
mood
had
changed
and
with
that
reserve
that
comes
of
misery
he
kept
silence
though
from
time
to
time
we
pressed
each
other
hands
that
we
might
feel
the
mutual
flow
of
our
ideas
and
impressions
we
walked
along
for
half
an
hour
in
silence
either
because
we
were
oppressed
by
the
heat
which
rose
in
waves
from
the
burning
sands
or
because
the
difficulty
of
walking
absorbed
our
attention
like
children
we
held
each
other
hands
in
fact
we
could
hardly
have
made
a
dozen
steps
had
we
walked
arm
in
arm
the
path
which
led
to
batz
was
not
so
much
as
traced
a
gust
of
wind
was
enough
to
efface
all
tracks
left
by
the
hoofs
of
horses
or
the
wheels
of
carts
but
the
practised
eye
of
our
guide
could
recognize
by
scraps
of
mud
or
the
dung
of
cattle
the
road
that
crossed
that
desert
now
descending
towards
the
sea
then
rising
landward
according
to
either
the
fall
of
the
ground
or
the
necessity
of
rounding
some
breastwork
of
rock
by
we
were
only
half
way
we
will
stop
to
rest
over
there
i
said
pointing
to
a
promontory
of
rocks
sufficiently
high
to
make
it
probable
we
should
find
a
grotto
the
fisherman
who
heard
me
and
saw
the
direction
in
which
i
pointed
shook
his
head
and
said
some
one
is
there
all
those
who
come
from
the
village
of
batz
to
croisic
or
from
croisic
to
batz
go
round
that
place
they
never
pass
it
these
words
were
said
in
a
low
voice
and
seemed
to
indicate
a
mystery
who
is
he
a
robber
a
murderer
our
guide
answered
only
by
drawing
a
deep
breath
which
redoubled
our
curiosity
but
if
we
pass
that
way
would
any
harm
happen
to
us
oh
no
will
you
go
with
us
no
monsieur
we
will
go
if
you
assure
us
there
is
no
danger
i
do
not
say
so
replied
the
fisherman
hastily
i
only
say
that
he
who
is
there
will
say
nothing
to
you
and
do
you
no
harm
he
never
so
much
as
moves
from
his
place
who
is
it
a
man
never
were
two
syllables
pronounced
in
so
tragic
a
manner
at
this
moment
we
were
about
fifty
feet
from
the
rocky
eminence
which
extended
a
long
reef
into
the
sea
our
guide
took
a
path
which
led
him
round
the
base
of
the
rock
we
ourselves
continued
our
way
over
it
but
pauline
took
my
arm
our
guide
hastened
his
steps
in
order
to
meet
us
on
the
other
side
where
the
two
paths
came
together
again
this
circumstance
excited
our
curiosity
which
soon
became
so
keen
that
our
hearts
were
beating
as
if
with
a
sense
of
fear
in
spite
of
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
fatigue
caused
by
toiling
through
the
sand
our
souls
were
still
surrendered
to
the
softness
unspeakable
of
our
exquisite
ecstasy
they
were
filled
with
that
pure
pleasure
which
can
not
be
described
unless
we
liken
it
to
the
joy
of
listening
to
enchanting
music
mozart
audiamo
mio
ben
for
instance
when
two
pure
sentiments
blend
together
what
is
that
but
two
sweet
voices
singing
to
be
able
to
appreciate
properly
the
emotion
that
held
us
it
would
be
necessary
to
share
the
state
of
half
sensuous
delight
into
which
the
events
of
the
morning
had
plunged
us
admire
for
a
long
time
some
pretty
dove
with
iridescent
colors
perched
on
a
swaying
branch
above
a
spring
and
you
will
give
a
cry
of
pain
when
you
see
a
hawk
swooping
down
upon
her
driving
its
steel
claws
into
her
breast
and
bearing
her
away
with
murderous
rapidity
when
we
had
advanced
a
step
or
two
into
an
open
space
which
lay
before
what
seemed
to
be
a
grotto
a
sort
of
esplanade
placed
a
hundred
feet
above
the
ocean
and
protected
from
its
fury
by
buttresses
of
rock
we
suddenly
experienced
an
electrical
shudder
something
resembling
the
shock
of
a
sudden
noise
awaking
us
in
the
dead
of
night
we
saw
sitting
on
a
vast
granite
boulder
a
man
who
looked
at
us
his
glance
like
that
of
the
flash
of
a
cannon
came
from
two
bloodshot
eyes
and
his
stoical
immobility
could
be
compared
only
to
the
immutable
granite
masses
that
surrounded
him
his
eyes
moved
slowly
his
body
remaining
rigid
as
though
he
were
petrified
then
having
cast
upon
us
that
look
which
struck
us
like
a
blow
he
turned
his
eyes
once
more
to
the
limitless
ocean
and
gazed
upon
it
in
spite
of
its
dazzling
light
as
eagles
gaze
at
the
sun
without
lowering
his
eyelids
try
to
remember
dear
uncle
one
of
those
old
oaks
whose
knotty
trunks
from
which
the
branches
have
been
lopped
rise
with
weird
power
in
some
lonely
place
and
you
will
have
an
image
of
this
man
here
was
a
ruined
herculean
frame
the
face
of
an
olympian
jove
destroyed
by
age
by
hard
sea
toil
by
grief
by
common
food
and
blackened
as
it
were
by
lightning
looking
at
his
hard
and
hairy
hands
i
saw
that
the
sinews
stood
out
like
cords
of
iron
everything
about
him
denoted
strength
of
constitution
i
noticed
in
a
corner
of
the
grotto
a
quantity
of
moss
and
on
a
sort
of
ledge
carved
by
nature
on
the
granite
a
loaf
of
bread
which
covered
the
mouth
of
an
earthenware
jug
never
had
my
imagination
when
it
carried
me
to
the
deserts
where
early
christian
anchorites
spent
their
lives
depicted
to
my
mind
a
form
more
grandly
religious
nor
more
horribly
repentant
than
that
of
this
man
you
who
have
a
experience
of
the
confessional
dear
uncle
you
may
never
perhaps
have
seen
so
awful
a
remorse
remorse
sunk
in
the
waves
of
prayer
the
ceaseless
supplication
of
a
mute
despair
this
fisherman
this
mariner
this
hard
coarse
breton
was
sublime
through
some
hidden
emotion
had
those
eyes
wept
that
hand
moulded
for
an
unwrought
statue
had
it
struck
that
ragged
brow
where
savage
honor
was
imprinted
and
on
which
strength
had
left
vestiges
of
the
gentleness
which
is
an
attribute
of
all
true
strength
that
forehead
furrowed
with
wrinkles
was
it
in
harmony
with
the
heart
within
why
was
this
man
in
the
granite
why
was
the
granite
in
the
man
which
was
the
man
which
was
the
granite
a
world
of
fancies
came
into
our
minds
as
our
guide
had
prophesied
we
passed
in
silence
rapidly
when
he
met
us
he
saw
our
emotion
of
mingled
terror
and
astonishment
but
he
made
no
boast
of
the
truth
of
his
prediction
he
merely
said
you
have
seen
him
who
is
that
man
they
call
him
the
man
of
the
vow
you
can
imagine
the
movement
with
which
our
two
heads
turned
at
once
to
our
guide
he
was
a
fellow
he
understood
at
once
our
mute
inquiry
and
here
follows
what
he
told
us
i
shall
try
to
give
it
as
best
i
can
in
his
own
language
retaining
his
popular
parlance
madame
folks
from
croisic
and
those
from
batz
think
this
man
is
guilty
of
something
and
is
doing
a
penance
ordered
by
a
famous
rector
to
whom
he
confessed
his
sin
somewhere
beyond
nantes
others
think
that
cambremer
that
his
name
casts
an
evil
fate
on
those
who
come
within
his
air
and
so
they
always
look
which
way
the
wind
is
before
they
pass
this
rock
if
it
they
would
go
by
no
not
if
their
errand
was
to
get
a
bit
of
the
true
cross
they
go
back
frightened
others
they
are
the
rich
folks
of
croisic
they
say
that
cambremer
has
made
a
vow
and
that
why
people
call
him
the
man
of
the
vow
he
is
there
night
and
day
he
never
leaves
the
place
all
these
sayings
have
some
truth
in
them
see
there
he
continued
turning
round
to
show
us
a
thing
we
had
not
remarked
look
at
that
wooden
cross
he
has
set
up
there
to
the
left
to
show
that
he
has
put
himself
under
the
protection
of
god
and
the
holy
virgin
and
the
saints
but
the
fear
that
people
have
of
him
keeps
him
as
safe
as
if
he
were
guarded
by
a
troop
of
soldiers
he
has
never
said
one
word
since
he
locked
himself
up
in
the
open
air
in
this
way
he
lives
on
bread
and
water
which
is
brought
to
him
every
morning
by
his
brother
daughter
a
little
lass
about
twelve
years
old
to
whom
he
has
left
his
property
a
pretty
creature
gentle
as
a
lamb
a
nice
little
girl
so
pleasant
she
has
such
blue
eyes
long
as
he
added
marking
a
line
on
his
thumb
and
hair
like
the
cherubim
when
you
ask
her
me
perotte
that
how
we
say
pierette
in
these
parts
he
remarked
interrupting
himself
she
is
vowed
to
saint
pierre
cambremer
is
named
pierre
and
he
was
her
godfather
me
perotte
what
does
your
uncle
say
to
you
says
nothing
to
me
nothing
then
what
does
he
do
to
you
kisses
me
on
the
forehead
sundays
you
afraid
of
him
no
no
is
he
my
godfather
he
would
have
anybody
but
me
bring
him
his
food
perotte
declares
that
he
smiles
when
she
comes
but
you
might
as
well
say
the
sun
shines
in
a
fog
he
as
gloomy
as
a
cloudy
day
but
i
said
to
him
you
excite
our
curiosity
without
satisfying
it
do
you
know
what
brought
him
there
was
it
grief
or
repentance
is
it
a
mania
is
it
crime
is
it
eh
monsieur
there
no
one
but
my
father
and
i
who
know
the
real
truth
my
late
mother
was
servant
in
the
family
of
a
lawyer
to
whom
cambremer
told
all
by
order
of
the
priest
who
would
give
him
absolution
until
he
had
done
so
at
least
that
what
the
folks
of
the
port
say
my
poor
mother
overheard
cambremer
without
trying
to
the
lawyer
kitchen
was
close
to
the
office
and
that
how
she
heard
she
dead
and
so
is
the
lawyer
my
mother
made
us
promise
my
father
and
i
not
to
talk
about
the
matter
to
the
folks
of
the
neighborhood
but
i
can
tell
you
my
hair
stood
on
end
the
night
she
told
us
the
tale
well
my
man
tell
it
to
us
now
and
we
wo
speak
of
it
the
fisherman
looked
at
us
then
he
continued
pierre
cambremer
whom
you
have
seen
there
is
the
eldest
of
the
cambremers
who
from
father
to
son
have
always
been
sailors
their
name
says
it
the
sea
bends
under
them
pierre
was
a
fisherman
he
had
boats
and
fished
for
sardine
also
for
the
big
fishes
and
sold
them
to
dealers
he
have
charted
a
large
vessel
and
trawled
for
cod
if
he
had
loved
his
wife
so
much
she
was
a
fine
woman
a
brouin
of
guerande
with
a
good
heart
she
loved
cambremer
so
much
that
she
could
bear
to
have
her
man
leave
her
for
longer
than
to
fish
sardine
they
lived
over
there
look
said
the
fisherman
going
up
a
hillock
to
show
us
an
island
in
the
little
mediterranean
between
the
dunes
where
we
were
walking
and
the
marshes
of
guerande
you
can
see
the
house
from
here
it
belonged
to
him
jacquette
brouin
and
cambremer
had
only
one
son
a
lad
they
loved
how
shall
i
say
well
they
loved
him
like
an
only
child
they
were
mad
about
him
how
many
times
we
have
seen
them
at
fairs
buying
all
sorts
of
things
to
please
him
it
was
out
of
all
reason
the
way
they
indulged
him
and
so
folks
told
them
the
little
cambremer
seeing
that
he
was
never
thwarted
grew
as
vicious
as
a
red
ass
when
they
told
pere
cambremer
son
has
nearly
killed
little
such
a
one
he
would
laugh
and
say
he
be
a
bold
sailor
command
the
king
fleets
another
time
cambremer
did
you
know
your
lad
very
nearly
put
out
the
eye
of
the
little
pougard
girl
he
like
the
girls
said
pierre
nothing
troubled
him
at
ten
years
old
the
little
cur
fought
everybody
and
amused
himself
with
cutting
the
hens
necks
off
and
ripping
up
the
pigs
in
fact
you
might
say
he
wallowed
in
blood
be
a
famous
soldier
said
cambremer
got
the
taste
of
blood
now
you
see
said
the
fisherman
i
can
look
back
and
remember
all
that
and
cambremer
too
he
added
after
a
pause
by
the
time
jacques
cambremer
was
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
of
age
he
had
come
to
be
what
shall
i
say
a
shark
he
amused
himself
at
guerande
and
was
after
the
girls
at
savenay
then
he
wanted
money
he
robbed
his
mother
who
did
dare
say
a
word
to
his
father
cambremer
was
an
honest
man
who
have
tramped
fifty
miles
to
return
two
sous
that
any
one
had
overpaid
him
on
a
bill
at
last
one
day
the
mother
was
robbed
of
everything
during
one
of
his
jacques
carried
off
all
she
had
furniture
pots
and
pans
sheets
linen
everything
he
sold
it
to
go
to
nantes
and
carry
on
his
capers
there
the
poor
mother
wept
day
and
night
this
time
it
be
hidden
from
the
father
and
she
feared
him
not
for
herself
you
may
be
sure
of
that
when
pierre
cambremer
came
back
and
saw
furniture
in
his
house
which
the
neighbors
had
lent
to
his
wife
he
said
is
all
this
the
poor
woman
more
dead
than
alive
replied
have
been
robbed
is
jacques
is
off
amusing
himself
no
one
knew
where
the
scoundrel
was
amuses
himself
too
much
said
pierre
six
months
later
the
poor
father
heard
that
his
son
was
about
to
be
arrested
in
nantes
he
walked
there
on
foot
which
is
faster
than
by
sea
put
his
hands
on
his
son
and
compelled
him
to
return
home
once
here
he
did
not
ask
him
have
you
done
but
he
said
you
do
not
conduct
yourself
properly
at
home
with
your
mother
and
me
and
go
fishing
and
behave
like
an
honest
man
you
and
i
will
have
a
reckoning
the
crazy
fellow
counting
on
his
parent
folly
made
a
face
on
which
pierre
struck
him
a
blow
which
sent
jacques
to
his
bed
for
six
weeks
the
poor
mother
nearly
died
of
grief
one
night
as
she
was
fast
asleep
beside
her
husband
a
noise
awoke
her
she
rose
up
quickly
and
was
stabbed
in
the
arm
with
a
knife
she
cried
out
loud
and
when
pierre
cambremer
struck
a
light
and
saw
his
wife
wounded
he
thought
it
was
the
doing
of
robbers
as
if
we
ever
had
any
in
these
parts
where
you
might
carry
ten
thousand
francs
in
gold
from
croisic
to
without
ever
being
asked
what
you
had
in
your
arms
pierre
looked
for
his
son
but
he
could
not
find
him
in
the
morning
if
that
monster
did
have
the
face
to
come
home
saying
he
had
stayed
at
batz
all
night
i
should
tell
you
that
the
mother
had
not
known
where
to
hide
her
money
cambremer
put
his
with
monsieur
dupotel
at
croisic
their
son
follies
had
by
this
time
cost
them
so
much
that
they
were
and
that
was
hard
for
folks
who
once
had
twelve
thousand
francs
and
who
owned
their
island
no
one
ever
knew
what
cambremer
paid
at
nantes
to
get
his
son
away
from
there
bad
luck
seemed
to
follow
the
family
troubles
fell
upon
cambremer
brother
he
needed
help
pierre
said
to
console
him
that
jacques
and
perotte
the
brother
daughter
could
be
married
then
to
help
joseph
cambremer
to
earn
his
bread
pierre
took
him
with
him
for
the
poor
man
was
now
obliged
to
live
by
his
daily
labor
his
wife
was
dead
of
the
fever
and
money
was
owing
for
nursing
the
wife
of
pierre
cambremer
owed
about
one
hundred
francs
to
divers
persons
for
the
little
girl
linen
clothes
and
what
not
and
it
so
chanced
that
she
had
sewed
a
bit
of
spanish
gold
into
her
mattress
for
a
toward
paying
off
that
money
it
was
wrapped
in
paper
and
on
the
paper
was
written
by
her
perotte
jacquette
brouin
had
had
a
fine
education
she
could
write
like
a
clerk
and
had
taught
her
son
to
write
too
i
ca
tell
you
how
it
was
that
the
villain
scented
the
gold
stole
it
and
went
off
to
croisic
to
enjoy
himself
pierre
cambremer
as
if
it
was
ordained
came
back
that
day
in
his
boat
as
he
landed
he
saw
a
bit
of
paper
floating
in
the
water
and
he
picked
it
up
looked
at
it
and
carried
it
to
his
wife
who
fell
down
as
if
dead
seeing
her
own
writing
cambremer
said
nothing
but
he
went
to
croisic
and
heard
that
his
son
was
in
a
billiard
room
so
then
he
went
to
the
mistress
of
the
cafe
and
said
to
her
told
jacques
not
to
use
a
piece
of
gold
with
which
he
will
pay
you
give
it
back
to
me
and
i
give
you
white
money
in
place
of
it
the
good
woman
did
as
she
was
told
cambremer
took
the
money
and
just
said
and
then
he
went
home
so
far
all
the
town
knows
that
but
now
comes
what
i
alone
know
though
others
have
always
had
some
suspicion
of
it
as
i
say
cambremer
came
home
he
told
his
wife
to
clean
up
their
chamber
which
is
on
the
lower
floor
he
made
a
fire
lit
two
candles
placed
two
chairs
on
one
side
of
the
hearth
and
a
stool
on
the
other
then
he
told
his
wife
to
bring
him
his
and
ordered
her
to
put
on
hers
he
dressed
himself
when
dressed
he
fetched
his
brother
and
told
him
to
watch
before
the
door
and
warn
him
of
any
noise
on
either
of
the
beaches
that
of
croisic
or
that
of
guerande
then
he
loaded
a
gun
and
placed
it
at
a
corner
of
the
fireplace
jacques
came
home
late
he
had
drunk
and
gambled
till
ten
and
had
to
get
back
by
way
of
the
carnouf
point
his
uncle
heard
his
hail
and
he
went
over
and
fetched
him
but
said
nothing
when
jacques
entered
the
house
his
father
said
to
him
there
pointing
to
the
stool
are
he
said
your
father
and
mother
whom
you
have
offended
and
who
will
now
judge
you
at
this
jacques
began
to
howl
for
his
father
face
was
all
distorted
his
mother
was
rigid
as
an
oar
you
shout
if
you
stir
if
you
do
not
sit
still
on
that
stool
said
pierre
aiming
the
gun
at
him
will
shoot
you
like
a
dog
jacques
was
mute
as
a
fish
the
mother
said
nothing
said
pierre
a
piece
of
paper
which
wrapped
a
spanish
gold
piece
that
piece
of
gold
was
in
your
mother
bed
she
alone
knew
where
it
was
i
found
that
paper
in
the
water
when
i
landed
here
you
gave
a
piece
of
spanish
gold
this
night
to
mere
fleurant
and
your
mother
piece
is
no
longer
in
her
bed
explain
all
this
jacques
said
he
had
not
taken
his
mother
money
and
that
the
gold
piece
was
one
he
had
brought
from
nantes
am
glad
of
it
said
pierre
prove
it
had
it
all
along
did
not
take
the
gold
piece
belonging
to
your
mother
you
swear
it
on
your
eternal
life
he
was
about
to
swear
his
mother
raised
her
eyes
to
him
and
said
my
child
take
care
do
not
swear
if
it
is
not
true
you
can
repent
you
can
amend
there
is
still
time
and
she
wept
are
a
this
and
a
that
he
said
have
always
wanted
to
ruin
me
cambremer
turned
white
and
said
language
to
your
mother
increases
your
crime
come
to
the
point
will
you
swear
pierre
said
there
upon
your
gold
piece
the
little
cross
which
the
sardine
merchant
who
paid
it
to
me
scratched
on
ours
jacques
broke
down
and
wept
said
pierre
shall
not
speak
to
you
of
the
crimes
you
have
committed
before
this
i
do
not
choose
that
a
cambremer
should
die
on
a
scaffold
say
your
prayers
and
make
haste
a
priest
is
coming
to
confess
you
the
mother
had
left
the
room
she
could
not
hear
her
son
condemned
after
she
had
gone
joseph
cambremer
the
uncle
brought
in
the
rector
of
piriac
to
whom
jacques
would
say
nothing
he
was
shrewd
he
knew
his
father
would
not
kill
him
until
he
had
made
his
confession
you
and
excuse
us
said
cambremer
to
the
priest
when
he
saw
jacques
obstinacy
wished
to
give
a
lesson
to
my
son
and
will
ask
you
to
say
nothing
about
it
as
for
you
he
said
to
jacques
you
do
not
amend
the
next
offence
you
commit
will
be
your
last
i
shall
end
it
without
confession
and
he
sent
him
to
bed
the
lad
thought
he
could
still
get
round
his
father
he
slept
his
father
watched
when
he
saw
that
his
son
was
soundly
asleep
he
covered
his
mouth
with
tow
blindfolded
him
tightly
bound
him
hand
and
foot
raged
he
wept
blood
my
mother
heard
cambremer
say
to
the
lawyer
the
mother
threw
herself
at
the
feet
is
judged
and
condemned
replied
pierre
must
now
help
me
carry
him
to
the
boat
she
refused
and
cambremer
carried
him
alone
he
laid
him
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
tied
a
stone
to
his
neck
took
the
oars
and
rowed
out
of
the
cove
to
the
open
sea
till
he
came
to
the
rock
where
he
now
is
when
the
poor
mother
who
had
come
up
here
with
her
cried
out
mercy
it
was
like
throwing
a
stone
at
a
wolf
there
was
a
moon
and
she
saw
the
father
casting
her
son
into
the
water
her
son
the
child
of
her
womb
and
as
there
was
no
wind
she
heard
and
then
nothing
neither
sound
nor
bubble
ah
the
sea
is
a
fine
keeper
of
what
it
gets
rowing
inshore
to
stop
his
wife
cries
cambremer
found
her
the
two
brothers
could
carry
her
the
whole
distance
home
so
they
had
to
put
her
into
the
boat
which
had
just
served
to
kill
her
son
and
they
rowed
back
round
the
tower
by
the
channel
of
croisic
well
well
the
belle
brouin
as
they
called
her
did
last
a
week
she
died
begging
her
husband
to
burn
that
accursed
boat
oh
he
did
it
as
for
him
he
became
i
do
know
what
he
staggered
about
like
a
man
who
ca
carry
his
wine
then
he
went
away
and
was
gone
ten
days
and
after
he
returned
he
put
himself
where
you
saw
him
and
since
he
has
been
there
he
has
never
said
one
word
the
fisherman
related
this
history
rapidly
and
more
simply
than
i
can
write
it
the
lower
classes
make
few
comments
as
they
relate
a
thing
they
tell
the
fact
that
strikes
them
and
present
it
as
they
felt
it
this
tale
was
made
as
sharply
incisive
as
the
blow
of
an
axe
i
shall
not
go
to
batz
said
pauline
when
we
came
to
the
upper
shore
of
the
lake
we
returned
to
croisic
by
the
salt
marshes
through
the
labyrinth
of
which
we
were
guided
by
our
fisherman
now
as
silent
as
ourselves
the
inclination
of
our
souls
was
changed
we
were
both
plunged
into
gloomy
reflections
saddened
by
the
recital
of
a
drama
which
explained
the
sudden
presentiment
which
had
seized
us
on
seeing
cambremer
each
of
us
had
enough
knowledge
of
life
to
divine
all
that
our
guide
had
not
told
of
that
triple
existence
the
anguish
of
those
three
beings
rose
up
before
us
as
if
we
had
seen
it
in
a
drama
culminating
in
that
of
the
father
expiating
his
crime
we
dared
not
look
at
the
rock
where
sat
the
fatal
man
who
held
the
whole
countryside
in
awe
a
few
clouds
dimmed
the
skies
mists
were
creeping
up
from
the
horizon
we
walked
through
a
landscape
more
bitterly
gloomy
than
any
our
eyes
had
ever
rested
on
a
nature
that
seemed
sickly
suffering
covered
with
salty
crust
the
eczema
it
might
be
called
of
earth
here
the
soil
was
mapped
out
in
squares
of
unequal
size
and
shape
all
encased
with
enormous
ridges
or
embankments
of
gray
earth
and
filled
with
water
to
the
surface
of
which
the
salt
scum
rises
these
gullies
made
by
the
hand
of
man
are
again
divided
by
causeways
along
which
the
laborers
pass
armed
with
long
rakes
with
which
they
drag
this
scum
to
the
bank
heaping
it
on
platforms
placed
at
equal
distances
when
the
salt
is
fit
to
handle
for
two
hours
we
skirted
the
edge
of
this
melancholy
checkerboard
where
salt
has
stifled
all
forms
of
vegetation
and
where
no
one
ever
comes
but
a
few
paludiers
the
local
name
given
to
the
laborers
of
the
salt
marshes
these
men
or
rather
this
clan
of
bretons
wear
a
special
costume
a
white
jacket
something
like
that
of
brewers
they
marry
among
themselves
there
is
no
instance
of
a
girl
of
the
tribe
having
ever
married
any
man
who
was
not
a
paludier
the
horrible
aspects
of
these
marshes
these
sloughs
the
mud
of
which
was
systematically
raked
the
dull
gray
earth
that
the
breton
flora
held
in
horror
were
in
keeping
with
the
gloom
that
filled
our
souls
when
we
reached
a
spot
where
we
crossed
an
arm
of
the
sea
which
no
doubt
serves
to
feed
the
stagnant
we
noticed
with
relief
the
puny
vegetation
which
sprouted
through
the
sand
of
the
beach
as
we
crossed
we
saw
the
island
on
which
the
cambremers
had
lived
but
we
turned
away
our
heads
arriving
at
the
hotel
we
noticed
a
and
finding
that
it
was
the
only
in
croisic
we
made
our
preparations
to
leave
during
the
night
the
next
day
we
went
to
guerande
pauline
was
still
sad
and
i
myself
felt
a
return
of
that
fever
of
the
brain
which
will
destroy
me
i
was
so
cruelly
tortured
by
the
visions
that
came
to
me
of
those
three
lives
that
pauline
said
at
last
louis
write
it
all
down
that
will
change
the
nature
of
the
fever
within
you
so
i
have
written
you
this
narrative
dear
uncle
but
the
shock
of
such
an
event
has
made
me
lose
the
calmness
i
was
beginning
to
gain
from
and
our
stay

this
place
