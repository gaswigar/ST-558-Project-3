kingship
of
crimes
of
the
red
tape
of
supreme
charity
of
the
the
great
american
greatness
of
life
over
our
revelations
of
reserve
majesty
of
the
scourge
of
power
of
personal
dignity
of
as
a
success
our
best
at
all
royal
road
to
i
the
kingship
man
has
two
creators
god
and
himself
his
first
creator
furnishes
him
the
raw
material
of
his
life
and
the
laws
in
conformity
with
which
he
can
make
that
life
what
he
will
his
second
creator
marvellous
powers
he
rarely
realizes
it
is
what
a
man
makes
of
himself
that
counts
when
a
man
fails
in
life
he
usually
says
i
am
as
god
made
when
he
succeeds
he
proudly
proclaims
himself
a
man
is
placed
into
this
world
not
as
a
finality
as
a
possibility
man
s
greatest
enemy
is
man
in
his
weakness
is
the
creature
of
circumstances
man
in
his
strength
is
the
creator
of
circumstances
whether
he
be
victim
or
victor
depends
largely
on
himself
man
is
never
truly
great
merely
for
what
he
but
ever
for
what
he
may
become
until
man
be
truly
filled
with
the
knowledge
of
the
majesty
of
his
possibility
until
there
come
to
him
the
glow
of
realization
of
his
privilege
to
live
the
life
committed
to
him
as
an
individual
life
for
which
he
is
individually
responsible
he
is
merely
groping
through
the
years
to
see
his
life
as
he
might
make
it
man
must
go
up
alone
into
the
mountains
of
spiritual
thought
as
christ
went
alone
into
the
garden
leaving
the
world
to
get
strength
to
live
in
the
world
he
must
there
breathe
the
fresh
pure
air
of
recognition
of
his
divine
importance
as
an
individual
and
with
mind
purified
and
tingling
with
new
strength
he
must
approach
the
problems
of
his
daily
living
man
needs
less
of
the
i
am
a
feeble
worm
of
the
dust
idea
in
his
theology
and
more
of
the
conception
i
am
a
great
human
soul
with
marvellous
possibilities
as
a
vital
element
in
his
daily
working
religion
with
this
broadening
stimulating
view
of
life
he
sees
how
he
may
attain
his
kingship
through
and
the
that
is
seen
in
the
most
spectacular
instances
in
history
and
in
the
simplest
phases
of
daily
life
is
precisely
the
same
in
kind
and
in
quality
differing
only
in
degree
this
control
man
can
attain
if
he
only
will
it
is
but
a
matter
of
paying
the
price
the
power
of
is
one
of
the
great
qualities
that
differentiates
man
from
the
lower
animals
he
is
the
only
animal
capable
of
a
moral
struggle
or
a
moral
conquest
every
step
in
the
progress
of
the
world
has
been
a
new
it
has
been
escaping
from
the
tyranny
of
a
fact
to
the
understanding
and
mastery
of
that
fact
for
ages
man
looked
in
terror
at
the
lightning
flash
he
has
begun
to
understand
it
as
electricity
a
force
he
has
mastered
and
made
his
slave
the
million
phases
of
electrical
invention
are
but
manifestations
of
our
control
over
a
great
force
but
the
greatest
of
all
control
is
at
each
moment
of
man
s
life
he
is
either
a
king
or
a
slave
as
he
surrenders
to
a
wrong
appetite
to
any
human
weakness
as
he
falls
prostrate
in
hopeless
subjection
to
any
condition
to
any
environment
to
any
failure
he
is
a
slave
as
he
day
by
day
crushes
out
human
weakness
masters
opposing
elements
within
him
and
day
by
day
a
new
self
from
the
sin
and
folly
of
his
past
he
is
a
king
he
is
a
king
ruling
with
wisdom
over
himself
alexander
conquered
the
whole
world
except
emperor
of
the
earth
he
was
the
servile
slave
of
his
own
passions
we
look
with
envy
upon
the
possessions
of
others
and
wish
they
were
our
own
sometimes
we
feel
this
in
a
vague
dreamy
way
with
no
thought
of
real
attainment
as
when
we
wish
we
had
queen
victoria
s
crown
or
emperor
william
s
sometimes
however
we
grow
bitter
storm
at
the
wrong
distribution
of
the
good
things
of
life
and
then
relapse
into
a
hopeless
fatalistic
acceptance
of
our
condition
we
envy
the
success
of
others
when
we
should
emulate
the
process
by
which
that
success
came
we
see
the
splendid
physical
development
of
sandow
yet
we
forget
that
as
a
babe
and
child
he
was
so
weak
there
was
little
hope
that
his
life
might
be
spared
we
may
sometimes
envy
the
power
and
spiritual
strength
of
a
paul
without
realizing
the
weak
saul
of
tarsus
from
which
he
was
transformed
through
his
we
shut
our
eyes
to
the
thousands
of
instances
of
the
world
s
successes
moral
physical
financial
or
spiritual
the
great
final
success
came
from
a
beginning
far
weaker
and
poorer
than
our
own
any
man
may
attain
if
he
only
will
he
must
not
expect
to
gain
it
save
by
long
continued
payment
of
price
in
small
progressive
expenditures
of
energy
nature
is
a
thorough
believer
in
the
installment
plan
in
her
relations
with
the
individual
no
man
is
so
poor
that
he
can
not
to
pay
for
what
he
wants
and
every
small
individual
payment
that
he
makes
nature
stores
and
accumulates
for
him
as
a
reserve
fund
in
his
hour
of
need
the
patience
man
expends
in
bearing
the
little
trials
of
his
daily
life
nature
stores
for
him
as
a
wondrous
reserve
in
a
crisis
of
life
with
nature
the
mental
the
physical
or
the
moral
energy
he
expends
daily
in
is
all
stored
for
him
and
transmuted
into
strength
nature
never
accepts
a
cash
payment
in
full
for
anything
would
be
an
injustice
to
the
poor
and
to
the
weak
it
is
only
the
progressive
installment
plan
nature
recognizes
no
man
can
make
a
habit
in
a
moment
or
break
it
in
a
moment
it
is
a
matter
of
development
of
growth
but
at
any
moment
man
may
to
make
or
begin
to
break
any
habit
this
view
of
the
growth
of
character
should
be
a
mighty
stimulus
to
the
man
who
sincerely
desires
and
determines
to
live
nearer
to
the
limit
of
his
possibilities
may
be
developed
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
we
tone
up
a
weak
muscle
little
exercises
day
by
day
let
us
each
day
do
as
mere
exercises
of
discipline
in
moral
gymnastics
a
few
acts
that
are
disagreeable
to
us
the
doing
of
which
will
help
us
in
instant
action
in
our
hour
of
need
the
exercises
may
be
very
for
a
time
an
intensely
interesting
book
at
the
most
thrilling
page
of
the
story
jumping
out
of
bed
at
the
first
moment
of
waking
walking
home
when
one
is
perfectly
able
to
do
so
but
when
the
temptation
is
to
take
a
car
talking
to
some
disagreeable
person
and
trying
to
make
the
conversation
pleasant
these
daily
exercises
in
moral
discipline
will
have
a
wondrous
tonic
effect
on
man
s
whole
moral
nature
the
individual
can
attain
in
great
things
only
through
in
little
things
he
must
study
himself
to
discover
what
is
the
weak
point
in
his
armor
what
is
the
element
within
him
that
ever
keeps
him
from
his
fullest
success
this
is
the
characteristic
upon
which
he
should
begin
his
exercise
in
is
it
selfishness
vanity
cowardice
morbidness
temper
laziness
worry
lack
of
purpose
form
human
weakness
assumes
in
the
masquerade
of
life
he
must
discover
he
must
then
live
each
day
as
if
his
whole
existence
were
telescoped
down
to
the
single
day
before
him
with
no
useless
regret
for
the
past
no
useless
worry
for
the
future
he
should
live
that
day
as
if
it
were
his
only
day
only
day
left
for
him
to
assert
all
that
is
best
in
him
the
only
day
left
for
him
to
conquer
all
that
is
worst
in
him
he
should
master
the
weak
element
within
him
at
each
slight
manifestation
from
moment
to
moment
each
moment
then
must
be
a
victory
for
it
or
for
him
will
he
be
king
or
will
he
be
slave
answer
rests
with
him
ii
the
crimes
tongue
the
second
most
deadly
instrument
of
destruction
is
the
dynamite
gun
first
is
the
human
tongue
the
gun
merely
kills
bodies
the
tongue
kills
reputations
and
ofttimes
ruins
characters
each
gun
works
alone
each
loaded
tongue
has
a
hundred
accomplices
the
havoc
of
the
gun
is
visible
at
once
the
full
evil
of
the
tongue
lives
through
all
the
years
even
the
eye
of
omniscience
might
grow
tired
in
tracing
it
to
its
finality
the
crimes
of
the
tongue
are
words
of
unkindness
of
anger
of
malice
of
envy
of
bitterness
of
harsh
criticism
gossip
lying
and
scandal
theft
and
murder
are
awful
crimes
yet
in
any
single
year
the
aggregate
sorrow
pain
and
suffering
they
cause
in
a
nation
is
microscopic
when
compared
with
the
sorrows
that
come
from
the
crimes
of
the
tongue
place
in
one
of
the
of
justice
the
evils
resulting
from
the
acts
of
criminals
and
in
the
other
the
grief
and
tears
and
suffering
resulting
from
the
crimes
of
respectability
and
you
will
start
back
in
amazement
as
you
see
the
scale
you
thought
the
heavier
shoot
high
in
air
at
the
hands
of
thief
or
murderer
few
of
us
suffer
even
indirectly
but
from
the
careless
tongue
of
friend
the
cruel
tongue
of
enemy
who
is
free
no
human
being
can
live
a
life
so
true
so
fair
so
pure
as
to
be
beyond
the
reach
of
malice
or
immune
from
the
poisonous
emanations
of
envy
the
insidious
attacks
against
one
s
reputation
the
loathsome
innuendoes
slurs
by
which
jealous
mediocrity
seeks
to
ruin
its
superiors
are
like
those
insect
parasites
that
kill
the
heart
and
life
of
a
mighty
oak
so
cowardly
is
the
method
so
stealthy
the
shooting
of
the
poisoned
thorns
so
insignificant
the
separate
acts
in
their
seeming
that
one
is
not
on
guard
against
them
it
is
easier
to
dodge
an
elephant
than
a
microbe
in
london
they
have
recently
formed
an
league
the
members
promise
to
combat
in
every
way
in
their
power
the
prevalent
custom
of
talking
scandal
the
terrible
and
unending
consequences
of
which
are
not
generally
scandal
is
one
of
the
crimes
of
the
tongue
but
it
is
only
one
every
individual
who
breathes
a
word
of
scandal
is
an
active
stockholder
in
a
society
for
the
spread
of
moral
contagion
he
is
instantly
punished
by
nature
by
having
his
mental
eyes
dimmed
to
sweetness
and
purity
and
his
mind
deadened
to
the
sunlight
and
glow
of
charity
there
is
developed
a
wondrous
ingenious
perversion
of
mental
vision
by
which
every
act
of
others
is
explained
and
interpreted
from
the
lowest
possible
motives
they
become
like
certain
carrion
flies
that
pass
lightly
over
acres
of
to
feast
on
a
piece
of
putrid
meat
they
have
developed
a
keen
scent
for
the
foul
matter
upon
which
they
feed
there
are
pillows
wet
by
sobs
there
are
noble
hearts
broken
in
the
silence
whence
comes
no
cry
of
protest
there
are
gentle
sensitive
natures
seared
and
warped
there
are
friends
separated
and
walking
their
lonely
ways
with
hope
dead
and
memory
but
a
pang
there
are
cruel
misunderstandings
that
make
all
life
look
dark
are
but
a
few
of
the
sorrows
that
come
from
the
crimes
of
the
tongue
a
man
may
lead
a
life
of
honesty
and
purity
battling
bravely
for
all
he
holds
dearest
so
firm
and
sure
of
the
rightness
of
his
life
that
he
never
thinks
for
an
instant
of
the
diabolic
ingenuity
that
makes
evil
and
evil
report
where
naught
but
good
really
exists
a
few
words
lightly
spoken
by
the
tongue
of
slander
a
significant
expression
of
the
eyes
a
cruel
shrug
of
the
shoulders
with
a
pursing
of
the
lips
then
friendly
hands
grow
cold
the
accustomed
smile
is
displaced
by
a
sneer
and
one
stands
alone
and
aloof
with
a
dazed
feeling
of
wonder
at
the
vague
intangible
something
that
has
caused
it
all
for
this
craze
for
scandal
sensational
newspapers
of
are
largely
responsible
each
newspaper
is
not
one
tongue
but
a
thousand
or
a
million
tongues
telling
the
same
foul
story
to
as
many
pairs
of
listening
ears
the
vultures
of
sensationalism
scent
the
carcass
of
immorality
afar
off
from
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
they
collect
the
sin
disgrace
and
folly
of
humanity
and
show
them
bare
to
the
world
they
do
not
even
require
for
morbid
memories
and
fertile
imaginations
make
even
the
worst
of
the
world
s
happenings
seem
tame
when
compared
with
their
monstrosities
of
invention
these
stories
and
the
discussions
they
excite
develop
in
readers
a
cheap
shrewd
power
of
distortion
of
the
acts
of
all
around
them
if
a
rich
man
give
a
donation
to
some
charity
they
say
he
is
doing
it
to
get
his
name
talked
about
help
his
if
he
give
it
anonymously
they
say
oh
it
s
some
millionaire
who
is
clever
enough
to
know
that
refraining
from
giving
his
name
will
pique
curiosity
he
will
see
that
the
public
is
informed
if
he
do
not
give
to
charity
they
say
oh
he
s
stingy
with
his
money
of
course
like
the
rest
of
the
to
the
vile
tongue
of
gossip
and
slander
virtue
is
ever
deemed
but
a
mask
noble
ideals
but
a
pretense
generosity
a
bribe
the
man
who
stands
above
his
fellows
must
expect
to
be
the
target
for
the
envious
arrows
of
their
inferiority
it
is
part
of
the
price
he
must
pay
for
his
advance
one
of
the
most
detestable
characters
in
all
literature
is
iago
envious
of
the
promotion
of
cassio
above
his
head
he
hated
othello
his
was
one
of
those
low
natures
that
become
absorbed
in
sustaining
his
dignity
talking
of
preserving
his
honor
it
has
so
long
been
dead
that
even
embalming
could
not
preserve
it
day
by
day
iago
dropped
his
poison
day
by
day
did
subtle
resentment
and
studied
vengeance
distill
the
poison
of
distrust
and
suspicion
into
more
powerfully
insidious
doses
with
a
mind
wonderfully
concentrated
by
the
blackness
of
his
purpose
he
wove
a
network
of
circumstantial
evidence
around
the
desdemona
and
then
murdered
her
vicariously
by
the
hand
of
othello
her
very
simplicity
confidence
innocence
and
artlessness
made
desdemona
the
easier
mark
for
the
diabolic
tactics
of
iago
iago
still
lives
in
the
hearts
of
thousands
who
have
all
his
despicable
meanness
without
his
cleverness
the
constant
dropping
of
their
lying
words
of
malice
and
envy
have
in
too
many
instances
at
last
worn
away
the
noble
reputations
of
their
superiors
to
sustain
ourselves
in
our
own
hasty
judgments
we
sometimes
say
as
we
listen
and
accept
without
investigation
the
words
of
these
modern
iagos
well
where
there
is
so
much
smoke
there
must
be
yes
but
the
fire
may
be
only
the
fire
of
malice
the
incendiary
firing
of
the
reputation
of
another
by
the
lighted
torch
of
envy
thrown
into
the
innocent
facts
of
a
life
of
superiority
iii
the
red
tape
duty
duty
is
the
most
overlauded
word
in
the
whole
vocabulary
of
life
duty
is
the
cold
bare
anatomy
of
righteousness
duty
looks
at
life
as
a
debt
to
be
paid
love
sees
life
as
a
debt
to
be
collected
duty
is
ever
paying
assessments
love
is
constantly
counting
its
premiums
duty
is
forced
like
a
pump
love
is
spontaneous
like
a
fountain
duty
is
prescribed
and
formal
it
is
part
of
the
red
tape
of
life
it
means
running
on
moral
rails
it
is
good
enough
as
a
beginning
it
is
poor
as
a
finality
the
boy
who
stood
on
the
burning
deck
and
who
committed
suicide
on
a
technical
point
of
obedience
has
been
held
up
to
the
school
children
of
this
century
as
a
model
of
faithfulness
to
duty
the
boy
was
the
victim
of
a
blind
adherence
to
the
red
tape
of
duty
he
was
placing
the
whole
responsibility
for
his
acts
on
someone
outside
himself
he
was
helplessly
waiting
for
instruction
in
the
hour
of
emergency
when
he
should
have
acted
for
himself
his
act
was
an
empty
sacrifice
it
was
a
useless
throwing
away
of
a
human
life
it
did
no
good
to
the
father
to
the
boy
to
the
ship
or
to
the
nation
the
captain
who
goes
down
with
his
sinking
vessel
when
he
has
done
everything
in
his
power
to
save
others
and
when
he
can
save
his
own
life
without
dishonor
is
the
victim
of
a
false
sense
of
duty
he
is
cruelly
forgetful
of
the
loved
ones
on
shore
that
he
is
sacrificing
his
death
means
a
spectacular
exit
from
life
the
cowardly
fear
of
an
investigating
committee
or
a
brave
man
s
loyal
yet
misguided
sense
of
duty
a
human
life
with
its
wondrous
possibilities
is
too
sacred
an
individual
trust
to
be
thus
lightly
thrown
into
eternity
they
tell
us
of
the
sublime
nobleness
of
the
roman
soldier
at
pompeii
whose
skeleton
was
found
centuries
afterward
imbedded
in
the
once
molten
lava
which
swept
down
upon
the
doomed
city
he
was
still
standing
at
one
of
the
gates
at
his
post
of
duty
still
grasping
a
sword
in
his
crumbling
fingers
his
was
a
morbid
faithfulness
to
a
discipline
from
which
a
great
convulsion
of
nature
had
released
him
an
automaton
would
have
stood
there
just
as
long
just
as
boldly
just
as
uselessly
the
man
who
gives
one
hour
of
his
life
to
loving
consecrated
service
to
humanity
is
doing
higher
better
truer
work
in
the
world
than
an
army
of
roman
sentinels
paying
useless
tribute
to
the
red
tape
of
duty
there
is
in
this
interpretation
of
duty
no
sympathy
with
the
man
who
deserts
his
post
when
needed
it
is
but
a
protest
against
losing
the
essence
the
realness
of
true
duty
in
worshipping
the
mere
form
analyze
if
you
will
any
of
the
great
historic
instances
of
loyalty
to
duty
and
whenever
they
ring
true
you
will
find
the
presence
of
the
real
element
that
made
the
act
almost
divine
it
was
duty
love
it
was
no
mere
sense
of
duty
that
made
grace
darling
risk
her
life
in
the
awful
storm
of
sixty
years
ago
when
she
set
out
in
the
darkness
of
night
on
a
raging
sea
to
rescue
the
survivors
of
the
wreck
of
the
it
was
the
sense
of
duty
warmed
and
vivified
by
a
love
of
humanity
it
was
heroic
courage
of
a
heart
filled
with
divine
pity
and
sympathy
duty
is
a
hard
mechanical
process
for
making
men
do
things
that
love
would
make
easy
it
is
a
poor
understudy
to
love
it
is
not
a
high
enough
motive
with
which
to
inspire
humanity
duty
is
the
body
to
which
love
is
the
soul
love
in
the
divine
alchemy
of
life
transmutes
all
duties
into
privileges
all
responsibilities
into
joys
the
workman
who
drops
his
tools
at
the
stroke
of
twelve
as
suddenly
as
if
he
had
been
struck
by
lightning
may
be
doing
his
duty
he
is
doing
nothing
more
no
man
has
made
a
great
success
of
his
life
or
a
fit
preparation
for
immortality
by
doing
merely
his
duty
he
must
do
that
more
if
he
puts
love
into
his
work
the
more
will
be
easy
the
nurse
may
watch
faithfully
at
the
bedside
of
a
sick
child
as
a
duty
but
to
the
mother
s
heart
the
care
of
the
little
one
in
the
battle
against
death
is
never
a
duty
the
golden
mantle
of
love
thrown
over
every
act
makes
the
word
duty
have
a
jarring
sound
as
if
it
were
the
voice
of
desecration
when
a
child
turns
out
badly
in
later
years
the
parent
may
say
well
i
always
did
my
duty
by
then
it
is
no
wonder
the
boy
turned
out
wrong
doing
his
duty
by
his
son
too
often
implies
merely
food
lodging
clothes
and
education
supplied
by
the
father
why
a
public
institution
would
give
that
what
the
boy
needed
most
was
deep
draughts
of
love
he
needed
to
live
in
an
atmosphere
of
sweet
sympathy
counsel
and
trust
the
parent
should
ever
be
an
unfailing
refuge
a
constant
resource
and
inspiration
not
a
mere
larder
or
hotel
or
wardrobe
or
school
that
furnishes
these
necessities
free
the
empty
boast
of
mere
parental
duty
is
one
of
the
dangers
of
modern
society
christianity
stands
forth
as
the
one
religion
based
on
love
not
duty
christianity
sweeps
all
duties
into
one
word
love
is
the
one
great
duty
enjoined
by
the
christian
religion
what
duty
creeps
to
laboriously
love
reaches
in
a
moment
on
the
wings
of
a
dove
duty
is
not
lost
condemned
or
destroyed
in
christianity
it
is
dignified
purified
and
exalted
and
all
its
rough
ways
are
made
smooth
by
love
the
supreme
instance
of
generosity
in
the
world
s
history
is
not
the
giving
of
millions
by
someone
of
great
name
it
is
the
giving
of
a
mite
by
a
widow
whose
name
does
not
appear
behind
the
widow
s
mite
was
no
sense
of
duty
it
was
the
full
free
and
perfect
gift
of
a
heart
filled
with
love
in
the
bible
duty
is
mentioned
but
five
times
love
hundreds
in
the
conquest
of
any
weakness
in
our
mental
or
moral
in
the
attainment
of
any
strength
in
our
highest
and
truest
relation
to
ourselves
and
to
the
world
let
us
ever
make
love
our
watchword
not
mere
if
we
desire
to
live
a
life
of
truth
and
honesty
to
make
our
word
as
strong
as
our
bond
let
us
not
expect
to
keep
ourselves
along
the
narrow
line
of
truth
under
the
constant
lash
of
the
whip
of
duty
let
us
begin
to
love
the
truth
to
fill
our
mind
and
life
with
the
strong
white
light
of
sincerity
and
sterling
honesty
let
us
love
the
truth
so
strongly
that
there
will
develop
within
us
without
our
conscious
effort
an
horror
of
a
lie
if
we
desire
to
do
good
in
the
world
let
us
begin
to
love
humanity
to
realize
more
truly
the
great
dominant
note
that
sounds
in
every
mortal
despite
all
the
discords
of
life
the
great
natural
bond
of
unity
that
makes
all
men
brothers
then
jealousy
malice
envy
unkind
words
and
cruel
misjudging
will
be
eclipsed
and
lost
in
the
sunshine
of
love
the
greatest
triumph
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
not
its
marvellous
progress
in
invention
its
strides
in
education
its
conquests
of
the
dark
regions
of
the
world
the
spread
of
a
higher
mental
tone
throughout
the
earth
the
wondrous
increase
in
material
comfort
and
wealth
greatest
triumph
of
the
century
is
not
any
nor
all
of
these
it
is
the
sweet
atmosphere
of
peace
that
is
covering
the
nations
it
is
the
growing
closer
and
closer
of
the
peoples
of
the
earth
peace
is
but
the
breath
the
perfume
the
life
of
love
love
is
the
wondrous
angel
of
life
that
rolls
away
all
the
stones
of
sorrow
and
suffering
from
the
pathway
of
duty
iv
the
supreme
charity
world
true
charity
is
not
typified
by
an
almsbox
the
benevolence
of
a
check
book
does
not
meet
all
the
wants
of
humanity
giving
food
clothing
and
money
to
the
poor
is
only
the
beginning
the
kindergarten
class
of
real
charity
charity
has
higher
purer
forms
of
manifestation
charity
is
but
an
instinctive
reaching
out
for
justice
in
life
charity
seeks
to
smooth
down
the
rough
places
of
living
to
bridge
the
chasms
of
human
sin
and
folly
to
feed
the
to
give
strength
to
the
struggling
to
be
tender
with
human
weakness
and
greatest
of
all
it
the
divine
injunction
judge
the
true
symbol
of
the
greatest
charity
is
the
scales
of
judgment
held
on
high
suspended
from
the
hand
of
justice
so
perfectly
are
they
poised
that
they
are
never
at
rest
they
dare
not
stop
for
a
moment
to
pronounce
final
judgment
each
second
adds
its
grain
of
evidence
to
either
side
of
the
balance
with
this
ideal
before
him
man
conscious
of
his
own
weakness
and
frailty
dare
not
arrogate
to
himself
the
divine
prerogative
of
pronouncing
severe
or
final
judgment
on
any
individual
he
will
seek
to
train
mind
and
heart
to
greater
keenness
purity
and
delicacy
in
watching
the
trembling
movement
of
the
balance
in
which
he
weighs
the
characters
and
reputations
of
those
around
him
it
is
a
great
pity
in
life
that
all
the
greatest
words
are
most
degraded
we
hear
people
say
i
do
so
love
to
study
character
in
the
cars
and
on
the
they
are
not
studying
character
they
are
merely
observing
characteristics
the
study
of
character
is
not
a
puzzle
that
a
man
may
work
out
over
night
character
is
most
subtle
elusive
changing
and
strange
mingling
of
habits
hopes
tendencies
ideals
motives
weaknesses
traditions
and
in
a
thousand
different
phases
there
is
but
one
quality
necessary
for
the
perfect
understanding
of
character
one
quality
that
if
man
have
it
he
may
to
is
omniscience
most
people
study
character
as
a
proofreader
pores
over
a
great
poem
his
ears
are
dulled
to
the
majesty
and
music
of
the
lines
his
eyes
are
darkened
to
the
magic
imagination
of
the
genius
of
the
author
that
proofreader
is
busy
watching
for
an
inverted
comma
a
or
a
letter
he
has
an
eye
trained
for
the
imperfections
the
weaknesses
men
who
pride
themselves
on
being
shrewd
in
discovering
the
weak
points
the
vanity
dishonesty
immorality
intrigue
and
pettiness
of
others
think
they
understand
character
they
know
only
part
of
know
only
the
depths
to
which
some
men
may
sink
they
know
not
the
heights
to
which
some
men
may
rise
an
optimist
is
a
man
who
has
succeeded
in
associating
with
humanity
for
some
time
without
becoming
a
cynic
we
never
see
the
target
a
man
aims
at
in
life
we
see
only
the
target
he
hits
we
judge
from
results
and
we
imagine
an
infinity
of
motives
that
we
say
must
have
been
in
his
mind
no
man
since
the
creation
has
been
able
to
live
a
life
so
pure
and
noble
as
to
exempt
him
from
the
misjudgment
of
those
around
him
it
is
impossible
to
get
aught
but
a
distorted
image
from
a
convex
or
a
concave
mirror
if
misfortune
comes
to
someone
people
are
prone
to
say
it
is
a
judgment
upon
how
do
they
know
have
they
been
eavesdropping
at
the
door
of
paradise
when
sorrow
and
failure
come
to
us
we
regard
them
as
misdirected
packages
that
should
be
delivered
elsewhere
we
do
too
much
watching
of
our
neighbor
s
garden
too
little
weeding
in
our
own
bottles
have
been
picked
up
at
sea
thousands
of
miles
from
the
point
where
they
have
been
cast
into
the
waters
they
have
been
the
sport
of
wind
and
weather
carried
along
by
ocean
currents
they
have
reached
a
destination
undreamed
of
our
flippant
careless
words
of
judgment
of
the
character
of
someone
words
lightly
and
perhaps
innocently
spoken
may
be
carried
by
unknown
currents
and
bring
sorrow
misery
and
shame
to
the
innocent
a
cruel
smile
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
or
a
cleverly
eloquent
silence
may
ruin
in
a
moment
the
reputation
a
man
or
woman
has
been
building
for
years
it
is
as
a
single
motion
of
the
hand
may
destroy
the
delicate
geometry
of
a
spider
s
web
spun
from
its
own
body
and
life
though
all
the
united
efforts
of
the
universe
could
not
put
it
back
as
it
was
we
do
not
need
to
judge
nearly
so
much
as
we
think
we
do
this
is
the
age
of
snap
judgments
the
habit
is
greatly
intensified
by
the
sensational
press
hours
after
a
great
murder
there
is
difficulty
in
getting
enough
men
who
have
not
already
formulated
a
judgment
to
try
the
case
these
men
in
most
instances
have
read
and
accepted
the
garbled
highly
colored
newspaper
account
they
have
to
their
own
satisfaction
discovered
the
murderer
practically
tried
him
him
we
hear
readers
state
their
decisions
with
all
the
force
and
absoluteness
of
one
who
has
had
the
whole
book
of
life
made
luminant
and
spread
out
before
him
if
there
be
one
place
in
life
where
the
attitude
of
the
agnostic
is
beautiful
it
is
in
this
matter
of
judging
others
it
is
the
courage
to
say
i
don
t
know
i
am
waiting
further
evidence
i
must
hear
both
sides
of
the
question
till
then
i
suspend
all
it
is
this
suspended
judgment
that
is
the
supreme
form
of
charity
it
is
strange
that
in
life
we
recognize
the
right
of
every
criminal
to
have
a
fair
open
trial
yet
we
condemn
unheard
the
dear
friends
around
us
on
mere
circumstantial
evidence
we
rely
on
the
mere
evidence
of
our
senses
trust
it
implicitly
and
permit
it
to
sweep
away
like
a
mighty
tide
the
faith
that
has
been
ours
for
years
we
see
all
life
grow
dark
hope
sink
before
our
eyes
and
the
golden
treasures
of
memory
turn
to
cruel
thoughts
of
loss
to
sting
us
with
maddening
pain
our
hasty
judgment
that
a
few
moments
of
explanation
would
remove
has
estranged
the
friend
of
our
life
if
we
be
thus
unjust
to
those
we
hold
dear
what
must
be
the
cruel
injustice
of
our
judgment
of
others
we
know
nothing
of
the
trials
sorrows
and
temptations
of
those
around
us
of
pillows
wet
with
sobs
of
the
that
may
be
hidden
behind
a
smile
of
the
secret
cares
struggles
and
worries
that
shorten
life
and
leave
their
mark
in
hair
prematurely
whitened
and
in
character
changed
and
almost
in
a
few
days
we
say
sometimes
to
one
who
seems
calm
and
smiling
you
ought
to
be
supremely
happy
you
have
everything
that
heart
could
it
may
be
that
at
that
very
moment
the
person
is
passing
alone
through
some
agony
of
sorrow
where
the
teeth
seem
almost
to
bite
into
the
lips
in
the
attempt
to
keep
feelings
under
control
when
life
seems
a
living
death
from
which
there
is
no
relief
then
these
light
flippant
phrases
jar
upon
us
and
we
seem
as
isolated
and
separated
from
the
rest
of
humanity
as
if
we
were
living
on
another
planet
let
us
not
dare
to
add
to
the
burden
of
another
the
pain
of
our
judgment
if
we
would
guard
our
lips
from
expressing
we
must
control
our
mind
we
must
stop
this
continual
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
acts
of
others
even
in
private
let
us
by
daily
exercises
in
learn
to
turn
off
the
process
of
we
would
turn
off
the
gas
let
us
eliminate
pride
passion
personal
feeling
prejudice
and
pettiness
from
our
mind
and
higher
purer
emotions
will
rush
in
as
air
seeks
to
fill
a
vacuum
charity
is
not
a
formula
it
is
an
atmosphere
let
us
cultivate
charity
in
judging
let
us
seek
to
draw
out
latent
good
in
others
rather
than
to
discover
hidden
evil
it
requires
the
eye
of
charity
to
see
the
undeveloped
butterfly
in
the
caterpillar
let
us
if
we
would
rise
to
the
full
glory
of
our
privilege
to
the
dignity
of
true
living
make
for
our
watchword
the
injunction
of
the
supreme
charity

raised
to
warn
parents
and
in
mercy
the
parent
should
take
a
firm
stand
the
burden
of
that
child
s
daily
tasks
should
be
lightened
the
tension
of
its
concentration
should
be
lessened
the
hours
of
its
slavery
to
education
should
be
cut
short
when
a
man
or
woman
works
over
in
dreams
the
problems
of
the
day
when
the
sleeping
hours
are
spent
in
turning
the
kaleidoscope
of
the
day
s
activities
then
there
is
either
overwork
or
worry
and
most
likely
it
is
the
worry
that
comes
from
overwork
the
creator
never
intended
a
healthy
mind
to
dream
of
the
day
s
duties
either
dreamless
sleep
or
dreams
of
the
past
should
be
the
order
of
the
night
when
the
spectre
of
one
grief
one
fear
one
sorrow
obtrudes
itself
between
the
eye
and
the
printed
page
when
the
inner
voice
of
this
irritating
memory
or
fear
looms
up
so
loud
as
to
deaden
outside
voices
there
is
danger
to
the
individual
when
all
day
every
hour
every
moment
there
is
the
dull
insistent
numb
pain
of
something
that
makes
itself
felt
through
above
and
below
all
our
other
thinking
we
must
know
that
we
are
worrying
then
there
is
but
one
thing
to
do
must
stop
that
worry
we
must
kill
it
the
wise
men
of
this
wondrous
century
have
made
great
discoveries
in
their
interviews
with
nature
they
have
discovered
that
everything
that
has
been
created
has
its
uses
they
will
teach
you
not
to
assassinate
flies
with
paper
coated
with
sweetened
glue
for
the
flies
are
nature
s
they
will
tell
you
just
what
are
the
special
duties
and
responsibilities
of
each
of
the
microscopic
microbes
with
telescopic
names
in
their
wildest
moods
of
scientific
enthusiasm
they
may
venture
to
persuade
you
into
believing
that
even
the
serves
some
real
purpose
in
nature
but
no
man
that
has
ever
lived
can
truthfully
say
a
good
word
about
worry
worry
is
forethought
gone
to
seed
worry
is
discounting
possible
future
sorrows
so
that
the
individual
may
have
present
misery
worry
is
the
father
of
insomnia
worry
is
the
traitor
in
our
camp
that
dampens
our
powder
weakens
our
aim
under
the
guise
of
helping
us
to
bear
the
present
and
to
be
ready
for
the
future
worry
multiplies
enemies
within
our
own
mind
to
sap
our
strength
worry
is
the
dominance
of
the
mind
by
a
single
vague
restless
unsatisfied
fearing
and
fearful
idea
the
mental
energy
and
force
that
should
be
concentrated
on
the
successive
duties
of
the
day
is
constantly
and
surreptitiously
abstracted
and
absorbed
by
this
one
fixed
idea
the
full
rich
strength
of
the
working
of
the
mind
that
which
produces
our
best
success
that
represents
our
finest
activity
is
tapped
led
away
and
wasted
on
worry
worry
must
not
be
confused
with
anxiety
though
both
words
agree
in
meaning
originally
a
choking
or
a
strangling
referring
of
course
to
the
throttling
effect
upon
individual
activity
anxiety
faces
large
issues
of
life
seriously
calmly
with
dignity
anxiety
always
suggests
hopeful
possibility
it
is
active
in
being
ready
and
devising
measures
to
meet
the
outcome
worry
is
not
one
large
individual
sorrow
it
is
a
colony
of
petty
vague
insignificant
restless
imps
of
fear
that
become
important
only
from
their
combination
their
constancy
their
iteration
when
death
comes
when
the
one
we
love
has
passed
from
us
and
the
silence
and
the
loneness
and
the
emptiness
of
all
things
make
us
stare
into
the
future
we
give
ourselves
up
for
a
time
to
the
agony
of
isolation
this
is
not
a
petty
worry
we
must
kill
ere
it
kills
us
this
is
the
awful
majesty
of
sorrow
that
mercifully
benumbs
us
though
it
may
later
become
in
the
mysterious
working
of
omnipotence
a
rebaptism
and
a
regeneration
it
is
the
worry
the
constant
magnifying
of
petty
sorrows
to
eclipse
the
sun
of
happiness
against
which
i
here
make
protest
to
cure
worry
the
individual
must
be
his
own
physician
he
must
give
the
case
heroic
treatment
he
must
realize
with
every
fibre
of
his
being
the
utter
absolute
uselessness
of
worry
he
must
not
think
this
is
commonplace
bit
of
mere
theory
it
is
a
reality
that
he
must
translate
for
himself
from
mere
words
to
a
real
living
fact
he
must
fully
understand
that
if
it
were
possible
for
him
to
spend
a
whole
series
of
eternities
in
worry
it
would
not
change
the
fact
one
jot
or
tittle
it
is
a
time
for
action
not
worry
because
worry
paralyzes
thought
and
action
too
if
you
set
down
a
column
of
figures
in
addition
no
amount
of
worry
can
change
the
sum
total
of
those
figures
that
result
is
wrapped
up
in
the
inevitability
of
mathematics
the
result
can
be
made
different
only
by
changing
the
figures
as
they
are
set
down
one
by
one
in
that
column
the
one
time
that
a
man
can
not
afford
to
worry
is
when
he
worry
then
he
is
facing
or
imagines
he
is
a
critical
turn
in
affairs
this
is
the
time
when
he
needs
one
hundred
per
cent
of
his
mental
energy
to
make
his
plans
quickly
to
see
what
is
his
wisest
decision
to
keep
a
clear
eye
on
the
sky
and
on
his
course
and
a
firm
hand
on
the
helm
until
he
has
weathered
the
storm
in
safety
there
are
two
reasons
why
man
should
not
worry
either
one
of
which
must
operate
in
every
instance
first
because
he
prevent
the
results
he
fears
second
because
he
prevent
them
if
he
be
powerless
to
avert
the
blow
he
needs
perfect
mental
concentration
to
meet
it
bravely
to
lighten
its
force
to
get
what
salvage
he
can
from
the
wreck
to
sustain
his
strength
at
this
time
when
he
must
plan
a
new
future
if
he
prevent
the
evil
he
fears
then
he
has
no
need
to
worry
for
he
would
by
so
doing
be
dissipating
energy
in
his
very
hour
of
need
if
man
do
day
by
day
ever
the
best
he
can
by
the
light
he
has
he
has
no
need
to
fear
no
need
to
regret
no
need
to
worry
no
agony
of
worry
would
do
aught
to
help
him
neither
mortal
nor
angel
can
do
more
than
his
best
if
we
look
back
upon
our
past
life
we
will
see
how
in
the
marvellous
working
of
events
the
cities
of
our
greatest
happiness
and
of
our
fullest
success
have
been
built
along
the
rivers
of
our
deepest
sorrows
our
most
abject
failures
we
then
realize
that
our
present
happiness
or
success
would
have
been
impossible
had
it
not
been
for
some
terrible
affliction
or
loss
in
the
past
wondrous
potent
force
in
the
evolution
of
our
character
or
our
fortune
this
should
be
a
wondrous
stimulus
to
us
in
bearing
the
trials
and
sorrows
of
life
to
cure
one
s
self
of
worry
is
not
an
easy
task
it
is
not
to
be
removed
in
two
or
three
applications
of
the
quack
medicine
of
any
cheap
philosophy
but
it
requires
only
clear
simple
commonsense
applied
to
the
business
of
life
man
has
no
right
to
waste
his
own
energies
to
weaken
his
own
powers
and
influence
for
he
has
inalienable
duties
to
himself
to
his
family
to
society
and
to
the
world
vi
the
greatness
simplicity
simplicity
is
the
elimination
of
the
in
all
things
it
reduces
life
to
its
minimum
of
real
needs
raises
it
to
its
maximum
of
powers
simplicity
means
the
survival
of
the
fittest
but
of
the
best
in
morals
it
kills
the
weeds
of
vice
and
weakness
so
that
the
flowers
of
virtue
and
strength
may
have
room
to
grow
simplicity
cuts
off
waste
and
intensifies
concentration
it
converts
flickering
torches
into
searchlights
all
great
truths
are
simple
the
essence
of
christianity
could
be
given
in
a
few
words
a
lifetime
would
be
but
continued
seeking
to
make
those
words
real
and
living
in
thoughts
and
acts
the
true
christian
s
individual
belief
is
always
simpler
than
his
church
creed
and
upon
these
vital
foundation
elements
he
builds
his
life
higher
criticism
never
rises
to
the
heights
of
his
simplicity
he
does
not
care
whether
the
whale
swallowed
jonah
or
jonah
swallowed
the
whale
interpretation
of
words
and
phrases
is
an
intellectual
dissipation
he
has
no
time
for
he
cares
naught
for
the
anatomy
of
religion
he
has
its
soul
his
simple
faith
he
lives
thought
and
word
and
act
day
by
day
like
the
lark
he
lives
nearest
the
ground
like
the
lark
he
soars
highest
toward
heaven
the
minister
whose
sermons
are
made
up
merely
of
flowers
of
rhetoric
sprigs
of
quotation
sweet
fancy
and
perfumed
commonplaces
or
in
the
pulpit
his
literary
sweet
froth
on
a
spongy
pulpy
base
never
helped
a
human
soul
give
neither
strength
nor
inspiration
if
the
mind
and
heart
of
the
preacher
were
really
thrilled
with
the
greatness
and
simplicity
of
religion
he
would
week
by
week
apply
the
ringing
truths
of
his
faith
to
the
vital
problems
of
daily
living
the
test
of
a
strong
simple
sermon
is
results
the
sunday
praise
of
his
auditors
but
their
bettered
lives
during
the
week
people
who
pray
on
their
knees
on
sunday
and
prey
on
their
neighbors
on
monday
need
simplicity
in
their
faith
no
character
can
be
simple
unless
it
is
based
on
it
is
lived
in
harmony
with
one
s
own
conscience
and
ideals
simplicity
is
the
pure
white
light
of
a
life
lived
from
within
it
is
destroyed
by
any
attempt
to
live
in
harmony
with
public
opinion
public
opinion
is
a
conscience
owned
by
a
syndicate
the
individual
is
merely
a
stockholder
but
the
individual
has
a
conscience
of
which
he
is
sole
proprietor
adjusting
his
life
to
his
own
ideals
is
the
royal
road
to
simplicity
affectation
is
the
confession
of
inferiority
it
is
an
unnecessary
proclamation
that
one
is
not
living
the
life
he
pretends
to
live
simplicity
is
restful
contempt
for
the
of
life
it
is
restless
hunger
for
the
that
is
the
secret
of
most
of
the
discontent
of
the
world
it
is
constant
striving
to
outshine
others
that
kills
simplicity
and
happiness
nature
in
all
her
revelations
seeks
to
teach
man
the
greatness
of
simplicity
health
is
but
the
living
of
a
physical
life
in
harmony
with
a
few
simple
clearly
defined
laws
simple
food
simple
exercise
simple
precautions
will
work
wonders
but
man
grows
tired
of
the
simple
things
he
yields
to
subtle
temptations
in
eating
and
drinking
listens
to
his
palate
instead
of
to
nature
he
suffers
he
is
then
led
into
intimate
acquaintance
with
dyspepsia
and
he
sits
like
a
child
at
his
own
bounteous
table
forced
to
limit
his
eating
to
simple
food
that
he
scorned
there
is
a
tonic
strength
in
the
hour
of
sorrow
and
affliction
in
escaping
from
the
world
and
society
and
getting
back
to
the
simple
duties
and
interests
we
have
slighted
and
forgotten
our
world
grows
smaller
but
it
grows
dearer
and
greater
simple
things
have
a
new
charm
for
us
and
we
suddenly
realize
that
we
have
been
renouncing
all
that
is
greatest
and
best
in
our
pursuit
of
some
phantom
simplicity
is
the
characteristic
that
is
most
difficult
to
simulate
the
signature
that
is
most
difficult
to
imitate
is
the
one
that
is
most
simple
most
individual
and
most
free
from
flourishes
the
bank
note
that
is
the
most
difficult
to
counterfeit
successfully
is
the
one
that
contains
the
fewest
lines
and
has
the
least
intricate
detail
so
simple
is
it
that
any
departure
from
the
normal
is
instantly
apparent
so
is
it
also
in
mind
and
in
morals
simplicity
in
act
is
the
outward
expression
of
simplicity
in
thought
men
who
carry
on
their
shoulders
the
fate
of
a
nation
are
quiet
modest
unassuming
they
are
often
made
gentle
calm
and
simple
by
the
discipline
of
their
responsibility
they
have
no
room
in
their
minds
for
the
pettiness
of
personal
vanity
it
is
ever
the
who
grows
pompous
when
he
thinks
that
the
whole
world
is
watching
him
as
he
marches
at
the
head
of
the
procession
the
great
general
bowed
with
the
honors
of
many
campaigns
is
simple
and
unaffected
as
a
child
the
college
graduate
assumes
the
airs
of
one
to
whom
is
committed
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
while
the
great
man
of
science
the
columbus
of
some
great
continent
of
investigation
is
simple
and
humble
the
longest
latin
derivatives
seem
necessary
to
express
the
thoughts
of
young
writers
the
world
s
great
masters
in
literature
can
move
mankind
to
tears
give
light
and
life
to
thousands
in
darkness
and
doubt
or
scourge
a
nation
for
its
folly
words
so
simple
as
to
be
commonplace
but
transfigured
by
the
divinity
of
genius
there
seems
almost
a
miracle
in
words
life
grows
wondrously
beautiful
when
we
look
at
it
as
simple
when
we
can
brush
aside
the
trivial
cares
and
sorrows
and
worries
and
failures
and
say
they
don
t
count
they
are
not
the
real
things
of
life
they
are
but
interruptions
there
is
something
within
me
my
individuality
that
makes
all
these
gnats
of
trouble
seem
too
trifling
for
me
to
permit
them
to
have
any
dominion
over
simplicity
is
a
mental
soil
where
artifice
lying
deceit
treachery
and
selfish
low
ambition
can
not
grow
the
man
whose
character
is
simple
looks
truth
and
honesty
so
straight
in
the
face
that
he
has
no
consciousness
of
intrigue
and
corruption
around
him
he
is
deaf
to
the
hints
and
whispers
of
wrongs
that
a
suspicious
nature
would
suspect
even
before
they
existed
he
scorns
to
meet
intrigue
with
intrigue
to
hold
power
by
bribery
to
pay
weak
tribute
to
an
inferior
that
has
a
temporary
inning
to
true
simplicity
to
perceive
a
truth
is
to
begin
to
live
it
to
see
a
duty
is
to
begin
to
do
it
nothing
great
can
ever
enter
into
the
consciousness
of
a
man
of
simplicity
and
remain
but
a
theory
simplicity
in
a
character
is
like
the
needle
of
a
compass
knows
only
one
point
its
north
its
ideal
let
us
seek
to
cultivate
this
simplicity
in
all
things
in
our
life
the
first
step
toward
simplicity
is
the
beginning
of
mental
or
moral
progress
or
reform
is
always
renunciation
or
sacrifice
it
is
rejection
surrender
or
destruction
of
separate
phases
of
habit
or
life
that
have
kept
us
from
higher
things
reform
your
diet
and
you
simplify
it
make
your
speech
truer
and
higher
and
you
simplify
it
reform
your
morals
and
you
begin
to
cut
off
your
immorals
the
secret
of
all
true
greatness
is
simplicity
make
simplicity
the
keynote
of
your
life
and
you
will
be
great
no
matter
though
your
life
be
humble
and
your
influence
seem
but
little
simple
habits
simple
manners
simple
needs
simple
words
simple
faiths
are
the
pure
manifestations
of
a
mind
and
heart
of
simplicity
simplicity
is
never
to
be
associated
with
weakness
and
ignorance
it
means
reducing
tons
of
ore
to
nuggets
of
gold
it
means
the
light
of
fullest
knowledge
it
means
that
the
individual
has
seen
the
folly
and
the
nothingness
of
those
things
that
make
up
the
sum
of
the
life
of
others
he
has
lived
what
others
are
blindly
seeking
to
live
to
simplicity
is
the
sun
of
a
and
pure
life
secret
of
any
specific
greatness
in
the
life
of
the
individual
vii
living
life
over
again
during
a
terrific
storm
a
few
years
ago
a
ship
was
driven
far
out
of
her
course
and
helpless
and
disabled
was
carried
into
a
strange
bay
the
water
supply
gave
out
and
the
crew
suffered
the
agony
of
thirst
yet
dared
not
drink
of
the
salt
water
in
which
their
vessel
floated
in
the
last
extremity
they
lowered
a
bucket
over
the
ship
s
side
and
in
desperation
quaffed
the
beverage
they
thought
was
but
to
their
joy
and
amazement
the
water
was
fresh
cool
and
they
were
in
a
arm
of
the
sea
and
they
did
not
know
it
they
had
simply
to
reach
down
and
accept
the
new
life
and
strength
for
which
they
prayed
man
with
the
sorrow
sin
and
failure
of
his
past
life
feels
that
he
could
live
a
better
life
if
he
could
only
have
another
chance
if
he
could
only
live
life
over
again
if
he
could
only
start
afresh
with
his
present
knowledge
and
experience
he
looks
back
with
regretful
memory
to
the
golden
days
of
youth
and
sadly
mourns
his
wasted
chances
he
then
turns
hopefully
to
the
thought
of
a
life
to
come
but
helpless
he
stands
between
the
two
ends
of
life
yet
thirsting
for
the
chance
to
live
a
new
life
according
to
his
bettered
condition
for
living
it
in
his
blindness
and
unknowing
he
does
not
realize
like
the
sailors
that
the
new
life
is
all
around
him
he
has
but
to
reach
out
and
take
it
every
day
is
a
new
life
every
sunrise
but
a
new
birth
for
himself
and
the
world
every
morning
the
beginning
of
a
new
existence
for
him
a
new
great
chance
to
put
to
new
and
higher
uses
the
results
of
his
past
living
the
man
who
looks
back
upon
his
past
life
and
says
i
have
nothing
to
regret
has
lived
in
vain
the
life
without
regret
is
the
life
without
gain
regret
is
but
the
light
of
fuller
wisdom
from
our
past
illumining
our
future
it
means
that
we
are
wiser
than
we
were
yesterday
this
new
wisdom
means
new
responsibility
new
privileges
it
is
a
new
chance
for
a
better
life
but
if
regret
remain
merely
regret
it
is
useless
it
must
become
the
revelation
of
new
possibilities
and
the
inspiration
and
source
of
strength
to
realize
them
even
omnipotence
could
not
change
the
past
but
each
man
to
a
degree
far
beyond
his
knowing
holds
his
future
in
his
own
hands
if
man
were
sincere
in
his
longing
to
live
life
over
he
would
get
more
help
from
his
failures
if
he
realize
his
wasted
golden
hours
of
opportunity
let
him
not
waste
other
hours
in
useless
regret
but
seek
to
forget
his
folly
and
to
keep
before
him
only
the
lessons
of
it
his
past
extravagance
of
time
should
lead
him
to
minify
his
loss
by
marvellous
economy
of
present
moments
if
his
whole
life
be
darkened
by
the
memory
of
a
cruel
wrong
he
has
done
another
if
direct
amends
be
impossible
to
the
injured
one
passed
from
life
let
him
make
the
world
the
legatee
to
receive
his
expressions
of
restitution
let
his
regret
and
sorrow
be
manifest
in
words
of
kindness
and
sympathy
and
acts
of
sweetness
and
love
given
to
all
with
whom
he
comes
in
contact
if
he
regrets
a
war
he
has
made
against
one
individual
let
him
place
the
entire
world
on
his
pension
list
if
a
man
make
a
certain
mistake
once
the
only
way
he
can
properly
express
his
recognition
of
it
is
not
to
make
a
similar
mistake
later
josh
billings
once
said
a
man
who
is
bitten
twice
by
the
same
dog
is
better
adapted
to
that
business
than
any
there
are
many
people
in
this
world
who
want
to
live
life
over
because
they
take
such
pride
in
their
past
they
resemble
the
beggars
in
the
street
who
tell
you
they
have
seen
better
it
is
not
what
man
that
shows
character
it
is
what
he
progressively
trying
to
obtain
a
present
record
on
a
dead
past
is
like
some
mediocrity
that
tries
to
live
on
its
ancestry
we
look
for
the
fruit
in
the
branches
of
the
family
tree
not
in
the
roots
showing
how
a
family
degenerated
from
a
noble
ancestor
of
generations
ago
to
its
present
representative
is
not
a
boast
is
an
unnecessary
confession
let
man
think
less
of
his
own
ancestors
and
more
of
those
he
is
preparing
for
his
posterity
less
of
his
past
virtue
and
more
of
his
future
when
man
pleads
for
a
chance
to
live
life
over
there
is
always
an
implied
plea
of
inexperience
of
a
lack
of
knowledge
this
is
unworthy
even
of
a
coward
we
know
the
laws
of
health
yet
we
ignore
them
or
defy
them
every
day
we
know
what
is
the
proper
food
for
us
individually
to
eat
yet
we
gratify
our
appetites
and
trust
to
our
cleverness
to
square
the
account
with
nature
somehow
we
know
that
success
is
a
matter
of
simple
clearly
defined
laws
of
the
development
of
mental
essentials
of
tireless
energy
and
concentration
of
constant
payment
of
price
know
all
this
and
yet
we
do
not
live
up
to
our
knowledge
we
constantly
eclipse
ourselves
by
ourselves
and
then
we
blame
fate
parents
often
counsel
their
children
against
certain
things
and
do
them
themselves
in
the
foolish
hope
that
the
children
will
believe
their
ears
in
preference
to
their
eyes
years
of
careful
teaching
of
a
child
to
be
honest
and
truthful
may
be
nullified
in
an
instant
by
a
parent
s
lying
to
a
conductor
about
a
child
s
age
to
save
a
nickel
that
may
be
a
very
expensive
ride
for
the
child
for
the
parent
it
may
be
part
of
the
spirit
of
the
age
to
believe
that
it
is
no
sin
to
cheat
a
corporation
or
a
trust
but
it
is
unwise
to
give
the
child
so
striking
an
example
at
an
age
when
it
can
not
detect
the
sophistry
man
s
only
plea
for
a
chance
to
live
life
again
is
that
he
has
gained
in
wisdom
and
experience
if
he
be
really
in
earnest
then
he
can
live
life
over
he
can
live
life
anew
he
can
live
the
new
life
that
comes
to
him
day
by
day
let
him
leave
to
the
past
to
the
aggregated
thousands
of
yesterdays
all
their
mistakes
sin
sorrow
misery
and
folly
and
start
afresh
let
him
close
the
books
of
his
old
life
let
him
strike
a
balance
and
start
anew
crediting
himself
with
all
the
wisdom
he
has
gained
from
his
past
failure
and
weakness
and
charging
himself
with
the
new
duties
and
responsibilities
that
come
from
the
possession
of
his
new
capital
of
wisdom
let
him
criticise
others
less
and
himself
more
start
out
bravely
in
this
new
life
he
is
to
live
what
the
world
needs
is
more
living
starting
in
the
morning
with
fresh
clear
ideals
for
that
day
and
seeking
to
live
that
day
and
each
successive
hour
and
moment
of
that
day
as
if
it
were
all
time
and
all
eternity
this
has
in
it
no
element
of
disregard
for
the
future
for
each
day
is
set
in
harmony
with
that
future
it
is
like
the
heading
his
vessel
toward
his
port
of
destination
and
day
by
day
keeping
her
steaming
toward
it
this
view
of
living
kills
morbid
regret
of
the
past
and
morbid
worry
about
the
future
most
people
want
large
guaranteed
slices
of
life
they
would
not
be
satisfied
with
manna
fresh
every
day
as
was
given
to
the
children
of
israel
they
want
grain
elevators
filled
with
daily
bread
life
is
worth
living
if
it
be
lived
in
a
way
that
is
worth
living
man
does
not
own
his
life
do
with
as
he
will
he
has
merely
a
in
it
he
must
finally
surrender
it
an
accounting
at
each
new
year
tide
it
is
common
to
make
new
resolutions
but
in
the
true
life
of
the
individual
each
day
is
the
beginning
of
a
new
year
if
he
will
only
make
it
so
a
mere
date
on
the
calendar
of
eternity
is
no
more
a
divider
of
time
than
a
particular
grain
of
sand
divides
the
desert
let
us
not
make
heroic
resolutions
so
far
beyond
our
strength
that
the
resolution
becomes
a
dead
memory
within
a
week
but
let
us
promise
ourselves
that
each
day
will
be
the
new
beginning
of
a
newer
better
and
truer
life
for
ourselves
for
those
around
us
and
for
the
world
viii
syndicating
our
sorrows
the
most
selfish
man
in
the
world
is
the
one
who
is
most
unselfish
his
sorrows
he
does
not
leave
a
single
misery
of
his
untold
to
you
or
unsuffered
by
you
gives
you
all
of
them
the
world
becomes
to
him
a
syndicate
formed
to
take
stock
in
his
private
cares
worries
and
trials
his
mistake
is
in
forming
a
syndicate
he
should
organize
a
trust
and
control
it
all
himself
then
he
could
keep
everyone
from
getting
any
of
his
misery
life
is
a
great
serious
problem
for
the
individual
all
our
greatest
joys
and
our
deepest
sorrows
come
to
us
we
must
go
into
our
gethsemane
we
must
battle
against
the
mighty
weakness
within
us
we
must
live
our
own
life
we
must
die
we
must
accept
the
full
responsibility
of
our
life
if
each
one
of
us
has
this
mighty
problem
of
life
to
solve
for
himself
if
each
of
us
has
his
own
cares
responsibilities
failures
doubts
fears
bereavements
we
surely
are
playing
a
coward
s
part
when
we
syndicate
our
sorrows
to
others
we
should
seek
to
make
life
brighter
for
others
we
should
seek
to
hearten
them
in
their
trials
by
the
example
of
our
courage
in
bearing
our
sorrows
we
should
seek
to
forget
our
failures
and
remember
only
the
new
wisdom
they
gave
us
we
should
live
down
our
griefs
by
counting
the
joys
and
privileges
still
left
to
us
put
behind
us
our
worries
and
regrets
and
face
each
new
day
of
life
as
bravely
as
we
can
but
we
have
no
right
to
retail
our
sorrow
and
unhappiness
through
the
community
autobiography
constitutes
a
large
part
of
the
conversation
of
some
people
it
is
not
really
conversation
is
an
uninterrupted
monologue
these
people
study
their
individual
lives
with
a
microscope
and
then
they
throw
an
enlarged
view
of
their
miseries
on
a
screen
and
lecture
on
them
as
a
stereopticon
man
discourses
on
the
microbes
in
a
drop
of
water
they
tell
you
that
they
did
not
sleep
a
wink
all
night
they
heard
the
clock
strike
every
quarter
of
an
now
there
is
no
real
cause
for
thus
boasting
of
insomnia
it
requires
no
peculiar
talent
though
it
does
come
only
to
people
if
you
ask
such
a
man
how
he
is
feeling
he
will
trace
the
whole
genealogy
of
his
present
condition
down
from
the
time
he
had
the
grippe
four
years
ago
you
hoped
for
a
word
he
gives
you
a
treatise
you
asked
for
a
sentence
he
delivers
an
encyclopedia
his
motto
is
every
man
his
own
he
is
syndicating
his
sorrows
the
woman
who
makes
her
trials
with
her
children
her
troubles
with
her
servants
her
difficulties
with
her
family
the
subjects
of
conversation
with
her
callers
is
syndicating
her
sorrows
if
she
has
a
dear
little
innocent
child
who
recites
curfew
shall
not
ring
is
it
not
wiser
for
the
mother
to
bear
it
calmly
and
discreetly
and
in
silence
than
to
syndicate
this
sorrow
the
business
man
who
lets
his
dyspepsia
get
into
his
disposition
and
who
makes
everyone
around
him
suffer
because
he
himself
is
ill
is
syndicating
we
have
no
right
to
make
others
the
victims
of
our
moods
if
illness
makes
us
cross
and
irritable
makes
us
unjust
to
faithful
workers
who
can
not
protest
let
us
quarantine
ourselves
so
that
we
do
not
spread
the
contagion
let
us
force
ourselves
to
speak
slowly
to
keep
anger
away
from
the
eyes
to
prevent
temper
showing
in
the
voice
if
we
feel
that
we
have
dyspepsia
let
us
keep
it
out
of
our
head
let
us
keep
it
from
getting
north
of
the
neck
most
people
sympathize
too
much
with
themselves
they
take
themselves
as
a
single
sentence
isolated
from
the
great
text
of
life
they
study
themselves
too
much
as
separated
from
the
rest
of
humanity
instead
of
being
vitally
connected
with
their
there
are
some
people
who
surrender
to
sorrow
as
others
give
way
to
dissipation
there
is
a
vain
pride
of
sorrow
as
well
as
of
beauty
most
individuals
have
a
strange
glow
of
vanity
in
looking
back
upon
their
past
and
feeling
that
few
others
in
life
have
suffered
such
trials
hardships
and
disappointments
as
have
come
to
them
when
death
comes
into
the
little
circle
of
loved
ones
who
make
up
our
world
all
life
becomes
dark
to
us
we
seem
to
have
no
reason
for
existing
no
object
no
incentive
no
hope
the
love
that
made
struggle
and
effort
bearable
for
us
gone
we
stare
into
the
future
and
see
no
future
we
want
none
life
has
become
to
us
a
past
no
future
it
is
but
a
memory
without
a
hope
then
in
the
divine
mystery
of
nature
s
processes
under
the
tender
soothing
touch
of
time
as
days
melt
into
weeks
we
begin
to
open
our
eyes
gently
to
the
world
around
us
and
the
noise
and
tumult
of
life
jars
less
and
less
upon
us
we
have
become
emotionally
convalescent
as
the
days
go
on
in
our
deep
love
in
the
fullness
of
our
loyalty
we
protest
often
with
tears
in
our
eyes
against
our
gradual
return
to
the
spirit
and
atmosphere
of
the
days
of
the
past
we
feel
in
a
subtle
way
a
new
pain
as
if
we
were
disloyal
to
the
dear
one
as
if
we
were
faithless
to
our
love
nature
sweetly
turns
aside
our
protesting
hands
and
says
to
us
there
is
no
disloyalty
in
permitting
the
wounds
to
lessen
their
pain
to
heal
gradually
if
time
foreordain
that
they
can
there
are
some
natures
in
a
mighty
love
wherein
no
healing
is
possible
these
are
rare
souls
in
life
bitter
though
our
anguish
be
we
have
no
right
to
syndicate
our
sorrow
we
have
no
right
to
cast
a
gloom
over
happy
natures
by
our
heavy
weight
of
crape
by
serving
the
term
prescribed
by
society
for
wearing
the
livery
of
mourning
if
real
grief
thought
of
a
uniform
we
have
no
right
to
syndicate
our
grief
by
using
notepaper
with
a
heavy
black
border
as
wide
as
a
hatband
thus
parading
our
personal
sorrow
to
others
in
their
happiest
moments
if
life
has
not
gone
well
with
us
if
fortune
has
left
us
disconsolate
if
love
has
grown
cold
and
we
sit
alone
by
the
embers
if
life
has
become
to
us
a
valley
of
desolation
through
which
weary
limbs
must
drag
an
unwilling
body
till
the
end
shall
come
us
not
radiate
such
an
atmosphere
to
those
round
us
let
us
not
take
strangers
through
the
catacombs
of
our
life
and
show
the
bones
of
our
dead
past
let
us
not
pass
our
cup
of
sorrow
to
others
but
if
we
must
drink
it
let
us
take
it
as
socrates
did
his
poison
hemlock
heroically
and
uncomplainingly
if
your
life
has
led
you
to
doubt
the
existence
of
honor
in
man
and
virtue
in
woman
if
you
feel
that
religion
is
a
pretense
that
spirituality
is
a
sham
that
life
is
a
failure
and
death
the
entrance
to
nothingness
if
you
have
absorbed
all
the
poison
philosophy
of
the
world
s
pessimists
and
committed
the
folly
of
believing
it
t
syndicate
it
if
your
be
clinging
to
one
frail
spar
the
last
remnant
of
a
noble
shipwrecked
faith
in
god
and
humanity
let
him
keep
it
do
not
loosen
his
fingers
from
his
hope
and
tell
him
it
is
a
delusion
how
do
you
know
who
told
you
it
was
so
if
these
moments
of
life
sweep
your
faith
in
omnipotence
into
nothingness
if
the
friend
in
whom
you
have
put
all
faith
in
humanity
and
humanity
s
god
betray
you
do
not
eagerly
accept
the
teachings
of
those
modern
freethinkers
who
syndicate
their
infidelity
at
so
much
per
reserved
seat
seek
to
recover
your
lost
faith
by
listening
to
the
million
voices
that
speak
of
infinite
wisdom
infinite
love
that
manifest
themselves
in
nature
and
humanity
and
then
build
up
as
rapidly
as
you
can
a
new
faith
a
faith
in
something
higher
better
and
truer
than
you
have
known
before
you
may
have
in
the
world
to
whom
you
may
dare
show
with
the
fullness
of

should

no

the
radiant

of
the
latent

the
untold

only
what

absolutely
necessary
for

when
new
needs
arise
nature
always
meets
them
by
her
reserve
power
in
animal
life
nature
reveals
this
in
a
million
phases
animals
placed
in
the
darkness
of
the
mammoth
cave
gradually
have
the
sense
of
sight
weakened
and
the
senses
of
smell
touch
and
hearing
intensified
nature
watches
over
all
animals
making
their
color
harmonize
with
the
general
tone
of
their
surroundings
to
protect
them
from
their
enemies
those
arctic
animals
which
in
the
summer
inhabit
regions
free
from

turn
white
when
winter
comes
in

the
lion

about
years
ago
three
pairs
of
enterprising
rabbits
were
introduced
into
australia
the
increase
of
these
six
immigrants
may
be
counted
by
millions
they
became
a
pest
to
the
country
fortunes
have
been
spent
to
exterminate
them
wire
fences
many
feet
high
and
thousands
of
miles
long
have
been
built
to
keep
out
the
invaders
the
rabbits
had
to
fight
awful
odds
to
live
but
they
have
now
outwitted
man
they
have
developed
a
new
nail
long
nail
by
which
they
can
retain
their
hold
on
the
fence
while
climbing
with
this
same
nail
they
can
burrow
six
or
eight
inches
under
the
netting
and
thus
enter
the
fields
that
mean
food
and
life
to
them
they
are
now
laughing
at
man
reserve
power
has
vitalized
for
these
rabbits
latent
possibilities
because
they
did
not
tamely
accept
their
condition
but
in
their
struggle
to
live
learned
to
live
in
plant
life
nature
is
constantly
revealing
reserve
power
the
possibilities
of
almost
infinite
color
are
present
in
green
plant
even
in
roots
and
stems
proper
conditions
only
are
needed
to
reveal
them
by
obeying
nature
s
laws
man
could
make
leaves
as
beautifully
colored
as
flowers
the
rose
has
only
a
single
corolla
but
when
cultivated
in
rich
soil
the
numerous
yellow
stamens
change
into
the
brilliant
red
leaves
of
the
this
is
but
one
of
nature
s
miracles
of
reserve
power
once
the
banana
was
a
tropical
lily
the
peach
was
at
one
time
a
bitter
almond
to
tell
the
full
story
of
reserve
power
in
nature
would
mean
to
write
the
history
of
the
universe
in
a
thousand
volumes
nature
is
a
great
believer
in
double
man
is
equipped
with
nearly
every
organ
in
ears
lungs
arms
and
legs
so
that
if
one
be
weakened
its
mate
through
reserve
power
is
stimulated
to
do
enough
for
both
even
where
the
organ
itself
is
not
duplicated
as
in
the
nose
there
is
a
division
of
parts
so
there
is
constant
reserve
nature
for
still
further
protection
has
for
every
part
of
the
body
an
understudy
in
training
to
be
ready
in
a
crisis
the
sense
of
touch
for
the
blind
birds
when
frightened
ruffle
their
feathers
a
dog
that
has
been
in
the
water
shakes
its
coat
so
that
each
hair
stands
out
of
itself
the
startled
hedgehog
projects
every
quill
these
actions
are
produced
by
skin
muscles
that
are
rudimentary
in
man
and
over
which
in
ordinary
conditions
he
has
no
control
but
in
a
moment
of
terrible
fear
reserve
power
quickens
their
action
in
a
second
and
the
hair
on
his
head
stands
on
end
in
the
intensity
of
his
fright
nature
that
thus
watches
so
tenderly
over
the
physical
needs
of
man
is
equally
provident
in
storing
for
him
a
mental
and
a
moral
reserve
power
man
may
fail
in
a
dozen
different
lines
of
activity
and
then
succeed
brilliantly
in
a
phase
wherein
he
was
unconscious
of
any
ability
we
must
never
rest
content
with
what
we
and
say
there
is
no
use
for
me
to
try
i
can
never
be
great
i
am
not
even
clever
but
the
law
of
reserve
power
stands
by
us
as
a
fairy
godmother
and
says
there
is
one
charm
by
which
you
can
transmute
the
dull
dross
of
your
present
condition
into
the
pure
gold

strength
and

ever
doing

daring

of
your
final
attainment

never

told
in

rely
upon
me
to
help
you
with
new
revelations
of
strength
in
new
emergencies

cast
down

your

seems
so
trifling

so

in
some
line
failures
many
times
before

was
crowned

there
is
in
the
mythology
of
the
norsemen
a
belief
that
the
strength
of
an
enemy
we
kill
enters
into
us
this
is
true
in
character
as
we
conquer
a
passion
a
thought
a
feeling
a
desire
as
we
rise
superior
to
some
impulse
the
strength
of
that
victory
trifling
though
it
may
be
is
stored
by
nature
as
a
reserve
power
to
come
to
us
in
the
hour
of
our
need
were
we
to
place
before
almost
any
individual

chart
of
his

and
loneliness
ask
him
if
he

no

could
not

from
him
the
wife
of
his
heart
reserve
power
has
been
watching
over
him
and
ever
giving
him
new
strength
while
he
sleeps
if
we
be
conscious
of
any
weakness
and
desire
to
conquer
it
we
can
force
ourselves
into
positions
where
we
act
in
a
way
to
strengthen
ourselves
through
that
weakness

off
our
retreat
burn
our
bridges
behind
us
and
fight
like
spartans
till

be
ours

is
like
the

to

at

as
each

is
taken
the
next
is
made
visible
and
thus
step
by

to
the
very
highest
so
in

economy
of

reserve

is
a
gradual
and
constant
revelation
of
strength
within
us
to
meet
each
new
need
and
no
matter
what
be
our
line
of
life
what
our
need
we
should
feel
that
we
have
within
us
infinite
untried
strength
and
possibility
and
that
if
we
believe
and
do
our
best
the
angel
of
reserve
power
will
walk
by
our
side
and
will
even
divide

calmness
is
the
rarest
quality
in

it

the

of
a
great
nature
in
harmony
with
itself
and
its
ideals
it
is
the

atmosphere
of

calmness
is
singleness
of

absolute

be
focused

more
fully
more
intensely
and
more
consciously
than

is
the
coward
slave

hopelessly
surrendering

no

no

no

inferiority

in

of
his
voyage
he
needs

a
cool
head
that
he
has
naught
to
do
but
to
do
each
day
the
best
he
can
by

into
nothingness

calmness

undismayed

persecution

tempts
you
for

for
an

forget
yourself
so
far
as
to
hunger
for
revenge

when
the
grey
heron
is
pursued
by
its
enemy
the
eagle
it
does
not
run
to
escape

remains
calm

stand
and
waits
quietly

the
enemy
unmoved
with

terrific
force
with
which
the
eagle
makes
its
attack

king

often
impaled
and

through

the
quiet
bill
of

takes
to
kill
another

character
becomes
suicide
of
his
own

man
in
the

ever
attempted
to
wrong
another
without
being
injured
in
return
somehow
sometime
the
only
weapon
of
offence
that
nature
seems
to
recognize
is
the
boomerang
nature
keeps
her
books
admirably
she
puts
down
every
item
she
closes
all
accounts
finally
but
she
does
not
always
balance
them
at
the
end
of
the
month
to
the
man
who
is
calm
revenge
is
so
far
beneath
him
that
he
can
not
reach
it
by
stooping
when
injured
he
does
not
retaliate
he
wraps
around
him
the
royal
robes
of
calmness
and
he
goes
quietly
on
his
way
when
the
hand
of
death
touches
the
one
we
hold
dearest
paralyzes
our
energy
and
eclipses
the
sun
of
our
life
the
calmness
that
has
been
accumulating
in
long
years
becomes
in
a
moment
our
refuge
our
reserve
strength
the
most
subtle
of
all
temptations
is
the
success
of
the
wicked
it
requires
moral
courage
to
see
without
flinching
material
prosperity
coming
to
men
who
are
dishonest
to
see
politicians
rise
into
prominence
power
and
wealth
by
trickery
and
corruption
to
see
virtue
in
rags
and
vice
in
velvets
to
see
ignorance
at
a
premium
and
knowledge
at
a
discount
to
the
man
who
is
really
calm
these
puzzles
of
life
do
not
appeal
he
is
living
his
life
as
best
he
can
he
is
not
worrying
about
the
problems
of
justice
whose
solution
must
be
left
to
omniscience
to
solve
when
man
has
developed
the
spirit
of
calmness
until
it
becomes
so
absolutely
part
of
him
that
his
very
presence
radiates
it
he
has
made
great
progress
in
life
calmness
can
not
be
acquired
of
itself
and
by
itself
it
must
come
as
the
culmination
of
a
series
of
virtues
what
the
world
needs
and
what
individuals
need
is
a
higher
standard
of
living

great

sense
of

privilege
and
dignity
of
life

and
nobler

this
great
sense
of
calmness

able
to
retire
more
into
himself
away
from
the
noise
the
confusion
and
strife
of
the
world
which
come
to
his
ears
only
as
faint
rumblings
or
as
the
tumult
of
the
life
of
a
city
heard
only
as
a
buzzing
hum
by
the
man
in
a
balloon
the
man
who
is
calm
does
not
selfishly
isolate
himself
from
the
world
for
he
is
intensely
interested
in
all
that
concerns
the
welfare
of
humanity
his
calmness
is
but
a
holy
of
holies
into
which
he
can
retire
the
world
to
get
strength
to
live
the
world
he
realizes
that
the

of

or
of
ages
comprising
millions
of
years
matters
little
if
we
but
learn
the
lesson
nature
is
very
nature
never
hurries
every
phase
of
her
working
shows
plan
calmness
reliability
and
the
absence
of
hurry
hurry
always
implies
lack
of
definite
method
confusion
impatience
of
slow
growth
the
tower
of
babel
the
world
s
first
was
a
failure
because
of
hurry
the
workers
mistook
their
arrogant
ambition
for
inspiration
they
had
too
many
builders
no
architect
they
thought
to
make
up
the
lack
of
a
head
by
a
superfluity
of
hands
this
is
a
characteristic
of
hurry
it
seeks
ever
to
make
energy
a
substitute
for
a
clearly
defined
plan
result
is
ever
as
hopeless
as
trying
to
transform
a
hobbyhorse
into
a
real
steed
by
brisk
riding
hurry
is
a
counterfeit
of
haste
haste
has
an
ideal
a
distinct
aim
to
be
realized
by
the
quickest
direct
methods
haste
has
a
single
compass
upon
which
it
relies
for
direction
and
in
harmony
with
which
its
course
is
determined
hurry
says
i
must
move
faster
i
will
get
three
compasses
i
will
have
them
different
i
will
be
guided
by
all
of
them
one
of
them
will
probably
be
hurry
never
realizes
that
slow
careful
foundation
work
is
the
quickest
in
the
end
hurry
has
ruined
more
americans
than
has
any
other
word
in
the
vocabulary
of
life
it
is
the
scourge
of
america
and
is
both
a
cause
and
a
result
of
our
civilization
hurry
adroitly
assumes
so
many
masquerades
of
disguise
that
its
identity
is
not
always
recognized
hurry
always
pays
the
highest
price
for
everything
and
usually
the
goods
are
not
delivered
in
the
race
for
wealth
men
often
sacrifice
time
energy
health
home
happiness
and
honor
that
money
can
not
buy
the
very
things
that
money
can
never
bring
back
hurry
is
a
phantom
of
paradoxes
business
men
in
their
desire
to
provide
for
the
future
happiness
of
their
family
often
sacrifice
the
present
happiness
of
wife
and
children
on
the
altar
of
hurry
they
forget
that
their
place
in
the
home
should
be
something
greater
than
being
merely
the
man
that
pays
the
bills
they
expect
consideration
and
thoughtfulness
that
they
are
not
giving
we
hear
too
much
of
a
wife
s
duties
to
a
husband
and
too
little
of
the
other
side
of
the
question
the
wife
they
tell
us
should
meet
her
husband
with
a
smile
and
a
kiss
should
tactfully
watch
his
moods
and
be
ever
sweetness
and
why
this
continual
swinging
of
the
censer
of
devotion
to
the
man
of
business
why
should
a
woman
have
to
look
up
with
timid
glance
at
the
face
of
her
husband
to
size
up
his
mood
has
not
her
day
too
been
one
of
care
and
responsibility
and
watchfulness
has
not
been
working
over
perplexing
problems
and
worries
of
home
and
of
the
training
of
the
children
that
wifely
love
may
make
her
seek
to
solve
in
secret
is
man
then
the
weaker
sex
that
he
must
be
pampered
and
treated
as
tenderly
as
a
boil
trying
to
keep
from
contact
with
the
world
in
their
hurry
to
attain
some
ambition
to
gratify
the
dream
of
a
life
men
often
throw
honor
truth
and
generosity
to
the
winds
politicians
dare
to
stand
by
and
see
a
city
poisoned
with
foul
water
until
they
see
where
they
come
in
on
a
waterworks
appropriation
if
it
be
necessary
to
poison
an
army
too
is
but
an
incident
in
the
hurry
for
wealth
this
is
the
age
of
the
hothouse
the
element
of
natural
growth
is
pushed
to
one
side
and
the
hothouse
and
the
are
substituted
nature
looks
on
tolerantly
as
she
says
so
far
you
may
go
but
no
farther
my
foolish
the
educational
system
of
is
a
monumental
institution
dedicated
to
hurry
the
children
are
forced
to
go
through
a
series
of
studies
that
sweep
the
circle
of
all
human
wisdom
they
are
given
everything
that
the
ambitious
ignorance
of
the
age
can
force
into
their
minds
they
are
taught
everything
but
the
essentials
to
use
their
senses
and
how
to
think
their
minds
become
congested
by
a
great
mass
of
undigested
facts
and
still
the
cruel
barbarous
forcing
goes
on
you
watch
it
until
it
seems
you
can
not
stand
it
a
moment
longer
and
you
instinctively
put
out
your
hand
and
say
stop
this
modern
slaughter
of
the
innocents
must
go
on
education
smiles
suavely
waves
her
hand
complacently
toward
her
thousands
of
over
the
country
and
says
who
are
you
that
dares
speak
a
word
against
our
sacred
school
system
education
is
in
a
hurry
because
she
fails
in
fifteen
years
to
do
what
half
the
time
should
accomplish
by
better
methods
she
should
not
be
too
boastful
incompetence
is
not
always
a
reason
for
pride
and
they
hurry
the
children
into
a
hundred
then
into
then
into
the
colleges
then
into
a
diploma
then
into
life
a
dazed
mind
untrained
and
unfitted
for
the
real
duties
of
living
hurry
is
the
deathblow
to
calmness
to
dignity
to
poise
the
courtesy
went
out
when
the
hurry
came
in

is
the
father
of
dyspepsia
in
the
rush
of
our
national
life
the
bolting
of
food
has
become
a
national
vice

be
placed

thousands
of
headstones
in
our
cemeteries

forgets
that
he
is
the
only
animal
that
dines
the
others
merely
feed
why
does
he
abrogate
his
right
to
dine
and
go
to
the
end
of
the
line
with
the
mere
feeders
his
stomach
rebels
and
expresses
its
indignation
by
indigestion
then
man
has
to
go
through
life
with
a
little
bottle
of
pepsin
tablets
in
his

is

another
victim
to
this
craze
for
speed
hurry
means
the
breakdown
of
the
nerves
it
is
the
royal
road
to
nervous
prostration
everything
that
is
great
in

is
the
product
of

degenerating
phases

the
power
personal
influence
the
only
responsibility
that
a
man
can
not
evade
in
this
life
is
the
one
he
thinks
of
least
personal
influence
man
s
conscious
influence
when
he
is
on
when
he
is
posing
to
impress
those
around
him
woefully
small
but
his
unconscious
influence
the
silent
subtle
radiation
of
his
personality
the
effect
of
his
words
and
acts
the
trifles
he
never
considers
tremendous
every
moment
of
life
he
is
changing
to
a
degree
the
life
of
the
whole
world
every
man
has
an
atmosphere
which
is
affecting
every
other
so
silent
and
unconsciously
is
this
influence
working
that
man
may
forget
that
it
exists
all
the
forces
of
nature
light
electricity
and
gravitation
silent
and
invisible
we
never
them
we
only
know
that
they
exist
by
seeing
the
effects
they
produce
in
all
nature
the
wonders
of
the
seen
are
dwarfed
into
insignificance
when
compared
with
the
majesty
and
glory
of
the
the
great
sun
itself
does
not
supply
enough
heat
and
light
to
sustain
animal
and
vegetable
life
on
the
earth
we
are
dependent
for
nearly
half
of
our
light
and
heat
upon
the
stars
and
the
greater
part
of
this
supply
of
energy
comes
from
stars
millions
of
miles
from
the
earth
in
a
thousand
ways
nature
constantly
seeks
to
lead
men
to
a
keener
and
deeper
realization
of
the
power
and
wonder
of
the
invisible
into
the
hands
of
every
individual
is
given
a
marvellous
power
for
good
or
for
evil
silent
unconscious
unseen
influence
of
his
life
this
is
simply
the
constant
radiation
of
what
a
man
really
not
what
he
pretends
to
be
every
man
by
his
mere
living
is
radiating
sympathy
or
sorrow
or
morbidness
or
cynicism
or
happiness
or
hope
or
any
of
a
hundred
other
qualities
life
is
a
state
of
constant
radiation
and
absorption
to
exist
is
to
radiate
to
exist
is
to
be
the
recipient
of
radiations
there
are
men
and
women
whose
presence
seems
to
radiate
sunshine
cheer
and
optimism
you
feel
calmed
and
rested
and
restored
in
a
moment
to
a
new
and
stronger
faith
in
humanity
there
are
others
who
focus
in
an
instant
all
your
latent
distrust
morbidness
and
rebellion
against
life
without
knowing
why
you
chafe
and
fret
in
their
presence
you
lose
your
bearings
on
life
and
its
problems
your
moral
compass
is
disturbed
and
unsatisfactory
it
is
made
untrue
in
an
instant
as
the
magnetic
needle
of
a
ship
is
deflected
when
it
passes
near
great
mountains
of
iron
ore
there
are
men
who
float
down
the
stream
of
life
like
icebergs
reserved
unapproachable
and
in
their
presence
you
involuntarily
draw
your
wraps
closer
around
you
as
you
wonder
who
left
the
door
open
these
refrigerated
human
beings
have
a
most
depressing
influence
on
all
those
who
fall
under
the
spell
of
their
radiated
chilliness
but
there
are
other
natures
warm
helpful
genial
who
are
like
the
gulf
stream
following
their
own
course
flowing
undaunted
and
undismayed
in
the
ocean
of
colder
waters
their
presence
brings
warmth
and
life
and
the
glow
of
sunshine
the
joyous
stimulating
breath
of
spring
there
are
men
who
are
like
malarious
swamps
depressing
and
weakening
by
their
very
presence
they
make
heavy
oppressive
and
gloomy
the
atmosphere
of
their
own
homes
the
sound
of
the
children
s
play
is
stilled
the
ripples
of
laughter
are
frozen
by
their
presence
they
go
through
life
as
if
each
day
were
a
new
big
funeral
and
they
were
always
chief
mourners
there
are
other
men
who
seem
like
the
ocean
they
are
constantly
bracing
stimulating
giving
new
draughts
of
tonic
life
and
strength
by
their
very
presence
there
are
men
who
are
insincere
in
heart
and
that
insincerity
is
radiated
by
their
presence
they
have
a
wondrous
interest
in
your
welfare
they
need
you
they
put
on
a
property
smile
so
suddenly
when
it
serves
their
purpose
that
it
seems
the
smile
must
be
connected
with
some
electric
button
concealed
in
their
clothes
their
voice
has
a
simulated
cordiality
that
long
training
may
have
made
almost
natural
but
they
never
play
their
part
absolutely
true
the
mask
slip
down
sometimes
their
cleverness
can
not
teach
their
eyes
the
look
of
sterling
honesty
they
may
deceive
some
people
but
they
can
not
deceive
all
there
is
a
subtle
power
of
revelation
which
makes
us
say
well
i
can
not
explain
how
it
is
but
i
know
that
man
is
not
man
can
not
escape
for
one
moment
from
this
radiation
of
his
character
this
constantly
weakening
or
strengthening
of
others

can
not

the
responsibility
by
saying
it
is
an
unconscious
influence
he
can

qualities

he
will
permit
to
be
radiated
he
can
cultivate
sweetness

loyalty
nobility
them
vitally
active
in
his
character
by
these
qualities
he
will
constantly
affect

discouragement
often
comes
to
honest
souls
trying
to
live
the
best
they
can
in
the
thought
that
they
are
doing
so
little
good
in
the
world
trifles
unnoted
by
us
may
be
links
in
the
chain
of
some
great
purpose
in
william
godwin
wrote
the
inquirer
a
collection
of
revolutionary
essays
on
morals
and
politics
this
book
influenced
thomas
malthus
to
write
his
essay
on
population
published
in
malthus
book
suggested
to
charles
darwin
a
point
of
view
upon
which
he
devoted
many
years
of
his
life
resulting
in
in
the
publication
of
the
origin
of
species
most
influential
book
of
the
nineteenth
century
a
book
that
has
revolutionized
all
science
these
were
but
three
links
of
influence
extending
over
sixty
years
it
might
be
possible
to
trace
this
genealogy
of
influence
back
from
godwin
through
generation
and
generation
to
the
word
or
act
of
some
shepherd
in
early
britain
watching
his
flock
upon
the
hills
living
his
quiet
life
and
dying
with
the
thought
that
he
had
done
nothing
to
help
the
world
men
and
women
have
duties
to
others
duties
to
themselves
in
justice
to
ourselves
we
should
refuse
to
live
in
an
atmosphere
that
keeps
us
from
living
our
best
if
the
fault
be
in
us
we
should
master
it
if
it
be
the
personal
influence
of
others
that
like
a
noxious
vapor
kills
our
best
impulses
we
should
remove
from
that
influence
we
can
move
without
forsaking
duties
if
it
be
wrong
to
move
then
we
should
take
strong
doses
of
moral
quinine
to
counteract
the
malaria
of
influence
it
is
not
what
those
around
us
for
us
that
counts
is
what
they
to
us
we
carry
our
houseplants
from
one
window
to
another
to
give
them
the
proper
heat
light
air
and
moisture
should
we
not
be
at
least
as
careful
of
ourselves
to
make
our
influence
felt
we
must
live
our
faith
we
must
practice
what
we
believe
a
magnet
does
not
attract
iron
as
iron
it
must
first
convert
the
iron
into
another
magnet
before
it
can
attract
it
it
is
useless
for
a
parent
to
try
to
teach
gentleness
to
her
children
when
she
herself
is
cross
and
irritable
the
child
who
is
told
to
be
truthful
and
who
hears
a
parent
lie
cleverly
to
escape
some
little
social
unpleasantness
is
not
going
to
cling
very
zealously
to
truth
the

the
influence
of
the
parent
s
life
says
do
no
man
can
ever
isolate
himself
to
evade
this
constant
power
of
influence
as
no
single
corpuscle
can
rebel
and
escape
from
the
general
course
of
the
blood
no
individual
is
so
insignificant
as
to
be
without
influence
the
changes
in
our
varying
moods
are
all
recorded
in
the
delicate
barometers
of
the
lives
of
others
we
should
ever
let
our
influence
filter
through
human
love
and
sympathy
we
should
not
be
merely
an
influence
should
be
an
inspiration
by
our
very
presence
we
should
be
a
tower
of
strength
to
the
hungering
human
souls
around
us

with
the
individual
nature
is
constantly
seeking
to
show
man
that
he
is
his
own
best
friend
or
his
own
worst
enemy
nature
gives
man
the
option
on
which
he
will
be
to
himself
all
the
athletic
exercises
in
the
world
are
of
no
value
to
the
individual
unless
he
compel
those
bars
and
to
yield
to
him
in
strength
and
muscle
the
power
for
which
he
himself
pays
in
time
and
effort
he
can
never
develop
his
muscles
by
sending
his
valet
to
a
gymnasium
the
of
the
world
are
powerless
in
all
the
united
efforts
to
help
the
individual
until
he
reach
out
and
take
for
himself
what
is
needed
for
his
individual
weakness
all
the
religions
of
the
world
are
but
speculations
in
morals
mere
theories
of
salvation
until
the
individual
realize
that
he
must
save
himself
by
relying
on
the
law
of
truth
as
he
sees
it
and
living
his
life
in
harmony
with
it
as
fully
as
he
can
but
religion
is
not
a
pullman
car
with
seats
where
he
has
but
to
pay
for
his
ticket
someone
else
does
all
the
rest
in
religion
as
in
all
other
great
things
he
is
ever
thrown
back
on
his
he
should
accept
all
helps
but
must
live
his
own
life
he
should
not
feel
that
he
is
a
mere
passenger
he
is
the
engineer
and
the
train
is
his
life
we
must
rely
on
ourselves
live
our
own
lives
or
we
merely
drift
through
existence
all
that
is
best
all
that
is
greatest
all
that
is
divine
all
that
others
can
do
for
us
is
to
give
us
opportunity
we
must
ever
be
prepared
for
the
opportunity
when
it
comes
and
to
go
after
it
and
find
it
when
it
does
not
come
or
that
opportunity
is
to
us
life
is
but
a
succession
of
opportunities
they
are
for
good
or
evil
we
make
them
many
of
the
alchemists
of
old
felt
that
they
lacked
but
one
element
if
they
could
obtain
that
one
they
believed
they
could
transmute
the
baser
metals
into
pure
gold
it
is
so
in
character
there
are
individuals
with
rare
mental
gifts
and
delicate
spiritual
discernment
who
fail
utterly
in
life
because
they
lack
the
one
element
this
would
unite
all
their
energies
and
focus
them
into
strength
and
power
the
man
who
is
not
is
weak
hesitating
and
doubting
in
all
he
does
he
fears
to
take
a
decisive
step
because
he
dreads
failure
because
he
is
waiting
for
someone
to
advise
him
or
because
he
dare
not
act
in
accordance
with
his
own
best
judgment
in
his
cowardice
and
his
conceit
he
sees
all
his
due
to
others
he
is
not
appreciated
not
recognized
he
is
kept
he
feels
that
in
some
subtle
way
society
is
conspiring
against
he
grows
almost
vain
as
he
thinks
that
no
one
has
had
such
poverty
such
sorrow
such
affliction
such
failure
as
have
come
to
him
the
man
who
is
seeks
ever
to
discover
and
conquer
the
weakness
within
him
that
keeps
him
from
the
attainment
of
what
he
holds
dearest
he
seeks
within
himself
the
power
to
battle
against
all
outside
influences
he
realizes
that
all
the
greatest
men
in
history
in
every
phase
of
human
effort
have
been
those
who
have
had
to
fight
against
the
odds
of
sickness
suffering
sorrow
to
him
defeat
is
no
more
than
passing
through
a
tunnel
is
to
a
traveller
knows
he
must
emerge
again
into
the
sunlight
the
nation
that
is
strongest
is
the
one
that
is
most
the
one
that
contains
within
its
boundaries
all
that
its
people
need
if
with
its
ports
all
blockaded
it
has
not
within
itself
the
necessities
of
life
and
the
elements
of
its
continual
progress
then
is
weak
held
by
the
enemy
and
it
is
but
a
question
of
time
till
it
must
surrender
its
independence
is
in
proportion
to
its
to
its
power
to
sustain
itself
from
within
what
is
true
of
nations
is
true
of
individuals
the
history
of
nations
is
but
the
biography
of
individuals
magnified
intensified
multiplied
and
projected
on
the
screen
of
the
past
history
is
the
biography
of
a
nation
biography
is
the
history
of
an
individual
so
it
must
be
that
the
individual
who
is
most
strong
in
any
trial
sorrow
or
need
is
he
who
can
live
from
his
inherent
strength
who
needs
no
scaffolding
of
commonplace
sympathy
to
uphold
him
he
must
ever
be
the
wealth
and
prosperity
of
ancient
rome
relying
on
her
slaves
to
do
the
real
work
of
the
nation
proved
the
nation
s
downfall
the
constant
dependence
on
the
captives
of
war
to
do
the
thousand
details
of
life
for
them
killed
in
the
nation
and
in
the
individual
then
through
weakened
and
the
increased
opportunity
for
idle
luxurious
ease
that
came
with
it
rome
a
nation
of
fighters
became
nation
of
men
more
effeminate
than
women
as
we
depend
on
others
to
do
those
things
we
should
do
ourselves
our
weakens
and
our
powers
and
our
control
of
them
becomes
continuously
less
man
to
be
great
must
be
though
he
may
not
be
so
in
all
things
he
must
be
in
the
one
in
which
he
would
be
great
this
is
not
the
of
conceit
it
is
daring
to
stand
alone
be
an
oak
not
a
vine
be
ready
to
give
support
but
do
not
crave
it
do
not
be
dependent
on
it
to
develop
your
true
you
must
see
from
the
very
beginning
that
life
is
a
battle
you
must
fight
for
yourself
must
be
your
own
soldier
you
can
not
buy
a
substitute
you
can
not
win
a
reprieve
you
can
never
be
placed
on
the
retired
list
the
retired
list
of
life
is
the
world
is
busy
with
its
own
cares
sorrows
and
joys
and
pays
little
heed
to
you
there
is
but
one
great
password
to
success
if
you
would
learn
to
converse
put
yourself
into
positions
where
you
speak
if
you
would
conquer
your
morbidness
mingle
with
the
bright
people
around
you
no
matter
how
difficult
it
may
be
if
you
desire
the
power
that
someone
else
possesses
do
not
envy
his
strength
and
dissipate
your
energy
by
weakly
wishing
his
force
were
yours
emulate
the
process
by
which
it
became
his
depend
on
your
pay
the
price
for
it
and
equal
power
may
be
yours
the
individual
must
look
upon
himself
as
an
investment
of
untold
possibilities
if
rightly
developed
mine
whose
resources
can
never
be
known
but
by
going
down
into
it
and
bringing
out
what
is
hidden
man
can
develop
his
by
seeking
constantly
to
surpass
himself
we
try
too
much
to
surpass
others
if
we
seek
ever
to
surpass
ourselves
we
are
moving
on
a
uniform
line
of
progress
that
gives
a
harmonious
unifying
to
our
growth
in
all
its
parts
daniel
morrell
at
one
time
president
of
the
cambria
rail
works
that
employed
men
and
made
a
rail
famed
throughout
the
world
was
asked
the
secret
of
the
great
success
of
the
works
we
have
no
secret
he
said
but
this
always
try
to
beat
our
last
batch
of
competition
is
good
but
it
has
its
danger
side
there
is
a
tendency
to
sacrifice
real
worth
to
mere
appearance
to
have
seeming
rather
than
reality
but
the
true
competition
is
the
competition
of
the
individual
with
himself
present
seeking
to
excel
his
past
this
means
real
growth
from
within
develops
it
and
it
develops
let
the
individual
feel
thus
as
to
his
own
progress
and
possibilities
and
he
can
almost
create
his
life
as
he
will
let
him
never
fall
down
in
despair
at
dangers
and
sorrows
at
a
distance
they
may
be
harmless
like
bunyan
s
stone
lions
when
he
nears
them
the
man
who
is
does
not
live
in
the
shadow
of
someone
else
s
greatness
he
thinks
for
himself
depends
on
himself
and
acts
for
himself
in
throwing
the
individual
thus
back
upon
himself
it
is
not
shutting
his
eyes
to
the
stimulus
and
light
and
new
life
that
come
with
the
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
the
kindly
word
and
sincere
expressions
of
true
friendship
but
true
friendship
is
rare
its
great
value
is
in
a
crisis
a
lifeboat
many
a
boasted
friend
has
proved
a
leaking
worthless
lifeboat
when
the
storm
of
adversity
might
make
him
useful
in
these
great
crises
of
life
man
is
strong
only
as
he
is
strong
from
within
and
the
more
he
depends
on
himself
the
stronger
will
he
become
and
the
more
able
will
he
be
to
help
others
in
the
hour
of
their
need
his
very
life
will
be
a
constant
help
and
a
strength
to
others
as
he
becomes
to
them
a
living
lesson
of
the
dignity
of
xiv
failure
success
it
ofttimes
requires
heroic
courage
to
face
fruitless
effort
to
take
up
the
broken
strands
of
a
to
look
bravely
toward
the
future
and
proceed
undaunted
on
our
way
but
what
to
our
eyes
may
seem
hopeless
failure
is
often
but
the
dawning
of
a
greater
success
it
may
contain
in
its
débris
the
foundation
material
of
a
mighty
purpose
or
the
revelation
of
new
and
higher
possibilities
some
years
ago
it
was
proposed
to
send
logs
from
canada
to
new
york
by
a
new
method
the
ingenious
plan
of
joggins
was
to
bind
great
logs
together
by
cables
and
iron
girders
and
to
tow
the
cargo
as
a
raft
when
the
novel
craft
neared
new
york
and
success
seemed
assured
a
terrible
storm
arose
in
the
fury
of
the
tempest
the
iron
bands
snapped
like
icicles
and
the
angry
water
scattered
the
logs
far
and
wide
the
chief
of
the
hydrographic
department
at
washington
heard
of
the
failure
of
the
experiment
and
at
once
sent
word
to
shipmasters
the
world
over
urging
them
to
watch
carefully
for
these
logs
which
he
described
and
to
note
the
precise
location
of
each
in
latitude
and
longitude
and
the
time
the
observation
was
made
hundreds
of
captains
sailing
over
the
waters
of
the
earth
noted
the
logs
in
the
atlantic
ocean
in
the
mediterranean
in
the
south
into
all
waters
did
these
venturesome
ones
travel
hundreds
of
reports
were
made
covering
a
period
of
weeks
and
months
these
observations
were
then
carefully
collated
systematized
and
tabulated
and
discoveries
were
made
as
to
the
course
of
ocean
currents
that
otherwise
would
have
been
impossible
the
loss
of
the
joggins
raft
was
not
a
real
failure
for
it
led
to
one
of
the
great
discoveries
in
modern
marine
geography
and
navigation
in
our
superior
knowledge
we
are
disposed
to
speak
in
a
patronizing
tone
of
the
follies
of
the
alchemists
of
old
but
their
failure
to
transmute
the
baser
metals
into
gold
resulted
in
the
birth
of
chemistry
they
did
not
succeed
in
what
they
attempted
but
they
brought
into
vogue
the
natural
processes
of
sublimation
filtration
distillation
and
crystallization
they
invented
the
alembic
the
retort
the
the
and
other
valuable
instruments
to
them
is
due
the
discovery
of
antimony
sulphuric
ether
and
phosphorus
the
cupellation
of
gold
and
silver
the
determining
of
the
properties
of
saltpetre
and
its
use
in
gunpowder
and
the
discovery
of
the
distillation
of
essential
oils
this
was
the
success
of
failure
a
wondrous
process
of
nature
for
the
highest
growth
mighty
lesson
of
comfort
strength
and
encouragement
if
man
would
only
realize
and
accept
it
many
of
our
failures
sweep
us
to
greater
heights
of
success
than
we
ever
hoped
for
in
our
wildest
dreams
life
is
a
successive
unfolding
of
success
from
failure
in
discovering
america
columbus
failed
absolutely
his
ingenious
reasoning
and
experiment
led
him
to
believe
that
by
sailing
westward
he
would
reach
india
every
redman
in
america
carries
in
his
name
indian
the
perpetuation
of
the
memory
of
the
failure
of
columbus
the
genoese
navigator
did
not
reach
india
the
cargo
of
souvenirs
he
took
back
to
spain
to
show
to
ferdinand
and
isabella
as
proofs
of
his
success
really
attested
his
failure
but
the
discovery
of
america
was
a
greater
success
than
was
any
finding
of
a
to
india
when
david
livingstone
had
supplemented
his
theological
education
by
a
medical
course
he
was
ready
to
enter
the
missionary
field
for
over
three
years
he
had
studied
tirelessly
with
all
energies
concentrated
on
one
aim
spread
the
gospel
in
china
the
hour
came
when
he
was
ready
to
start
out
with
noble
enthusiasm
for
his
chosen
work
to
consecrate
himself
and
his
life
to
his
unselfish
ambition
then
word
came
from
china
that
the
opium
war
would
make
it
folly
to
attempt
to
enter
the
country
disappointment
and
failure
did
not
long
daunt
him
he
offered
himself
as
missionary
to
africa
he
was
accepted
his
glorious
failure
to
reach
china
opened
a
whole
continent
to
light
and
truth
his
study
proved
an
ideal
preparation
for
his
labors
as
physician
explorer
teacher
and
evangel
in
the
wilds
of
africa
business
reverses
and
the
failure
of
his
partner
threw
upon
the
broad
shoulders
and
the
still
broader
honor
and
honesty
of
sir
walter
scott
a
burden
of
responsibility
that
forced
him
to
write
the
failure
spurred
him
to
almost
superhuman
effort
the
masterpieces
of
scotch
historic
fiction
that
have
thrilled
entertained
and
uplifted
millions
of
his
are
a
glorious
monument
on
the
field
of
a
seeming
failure
when
millet
the
painter
of
the
angelus
worked
on
his
almost
divine
canvas
in
which
the
very
air
seems
pulsing
with
the
regenerating
essence
of
spiritual
reverence
he
was
painting
against
time
he
was
antidoting
sorrow
he
was
racing
against
death
his
brush
strokes
put
on
in
the
early
morning
hours
before
going
to
his
menial
duties
as
a
railway
porter
in
the
dusk
like
that
perpetuated
on
his
canvas
strength
food
and
medicine
for
the
dying
wife
he
adored
the
art
failure
that
cast
him
into
the
depths
of
poverty
unified
with
marvellous
intensity
all
the
finer
elements
of
his
nature
this
rare
spiritual
unity
this
purging
of
all
the
dross
of
triviality
as
he
passed
through
the
furnace
of
poverty
trial
and
sorrow
gave
eloquence
to
his
brush
and
enabled
him
to
paint
as
never
before
no
prosperity
would
have
made
possible
failure
is
often
the
the
pivot
of
circumstance
that
swings
us
to
higher
levels
it
may
not
be
financial
success
it
may
not
be
fame
it
may
be
new
draughts
of
spiritual
moral
or
mental
inspiration
that
will
change
us
for
all
the
later
years
of
our
life
life
is
not
really
what
comes
to
us
but
what
we
get
from
it
whether
man
has
had
wealth
or
poverty
failure
or
success
counts
for
little
when
it
is
past
there
is
but
one
question
for
him
to
answer
to
face
boldly
and
honestly
as
an
individual
alone
with
his
conscience
and
his
destiny
how
will
i
let
that
poverty
or
wealth
affect
me
if
that
trial
or
deprivation
has
left
me
better
truer
nobler
then
has
been
riches
failure
has
been
a
success
if
wealth
has
come
to
me
and
has
made
me
vain
arrogant
contemptuous
uncharitable
cynical
closing
from
me
all
the
tenderness
of
life
all
the
channels
of
higher
development
of
possible
good
to
my
making
me
the
mere
custodian
of
a
then
has
lied
to
me
it
has
been
failure
not
success
it
has
not
been
riches
it
has
been
dark
treacherous
poverty
that
stole
from
me
even
all
things
become
for
us
then
what
we
take
from
them
failure
is
one
of
god
s
educators
it
is
experience
leading
man
to
higher
things
it
is
the
revelation
of
a
way
a
path
hitherto
unknown
to
us
the
best
men
in
the
world
those
who
have
made
the
greatest
real
successes
look
back
with
serene
happiness
on
their
failures
the
turning
of
the
face
of
time
shows
all
things
in
a
wondrously
illuminated
and
satisfying
perspective
many
a
man
is
thankful
that
some
petty
success
for
which
he
once
struggled
melted
into
thin
air
as
his
hand
sought
to
clutch
it
failure
is
often
the
foundation
of
real
success
if
man
in
a
few
instances
of
his
life
can
say
those
failures
were
the

the

only
the

not

it
leaving
the

if

consider

we

how

that
what
gives

many

is
a

in

of
illumination
he
awakens
to
the

realization
that
he
can
make

simple
quite
simple
but
always
simpler
there
are
a
thousand
mysteries
of
right
and
wrong
that
have
baffled
the
wise
men
of
the
ages
there
are
depths
in
the
great
fundamental
question
of
the
human
race
that
no
plummet
of
philosophy
has
ever
sounded
there
are
wild
cries
of
honest
hunger
for
truth
that
seek
to
pierce
the
silence
beyond
the
grave
but
to
them
ever
echo
back
a
repetition
of
their
unanswered
cries
to
us
all
comes
at
times
the
great
note
of
questioning
despair
that
darkens
our
horizon
and
paralyzes
our
effort
if
there
really
be
a

if

really
rule
the

we

be

why
do
some

starve
while
others
feast
why
does
virtue
often
languish
in
the
shadow
while
vice
triumphs
in
the
sunshine
why
does
failure
so
often
dog
the
footsteps
of
honest
effort
while
the
success
that
comes
from
trickery
and
dishonor
is
greeted
with
the
world
s
applause
how
is
it
that
the
loving
father
of
one
family
is
taken
by
death
while
the
worthless
incumbrance
of
another
is
spared
why
is
there
so

sorrowing
and
suffering
in

there
is
ever

after

a
residuum
of

must

to
secure

opposed
to
no
creed
is
a
substitute
for
none
it
is
but
a
primary
belief
a
citadel
a
refuge
where
the
individual
can
retire
for
strength
when
the
battle
of
life
grows
hard
a
mere
theory
of
life
that
remains
but
a
theory
is
about
as
useful
to
a
man
as
a
menu
is
to
a
starving
sailor
on
a
raft
in
it
is
irritating
but
not
stimulating
no
rule
for
higher
living
will
help
a
man
in
the
slightest
until
he
reach
out
and
appropriate
it
for
himself
until
he
make
it
practical
in
his
daily
life
until
that
seed
of
theory
in
his
mind
blossom
into
a
thousand
flowers
of
thought
and
word
and
act
if
a
man
honestly
seek
to
live
his
best
at
all
times
that
determination
is
visible
in
every
moment
of
his
living
and
no
trifle
in
his
life
can
be
too
insignificant
to
reflect
his
principle
of
living
the
sun
illuminates
and
beautifies
a
fallen
leaf
by
the
roadside
as
impartially
as
a
towering
mountain
peak
in
the

every
drop
of
water
in
the
ocean
is
an
epitome
of
the
chemistry
of
the
whole
ocean
every
drop
is
subject
to
precisely
the
same
laws
as
dominate
the
united
infinity
of
billions
of
drops
that
make
that
miracle
of
nature
men
call
the
sea
no
matter
how
humble
the
calling
of
the
individual
how
uninteresting
and
dull
the
round
of
his
duties
he
should
do
his
best
he
should
dignify
what
he
is
doing
by
the
mind
he
puts
into
it
he
should
vitalize
what
little
he
has
of
power
or
energy
or
ability
or
opportunity
in
order
to
prepare
himself
to
be
equal
to
higher
privileges
when
they
come
this
will
never
lead
man
to
that
weak
content
that
is
satisfied
with
whatever
falls
to
his
lot
it
will
rather
fill
his
mind
with
that
divine
discontent
that
cheerfully
accepts
the
as
a
temporary
substitute
for
something
better
the
man
who
is
seeking
ever
to
do
his
best
is
the
man
who
is
keen
active
and
aggressive
he
is
ever
watchful
of
himself
in
trifles
his
standard
is
not
what
will
the
world
say
but
is
it
worthy
of
me
edwin
booth
one
of
the
greatest
actors
on
the
american
stage
would
never
permit
himself
to
assume
an
ungraceful
attitude
even
in
his
hours
of
privacy
in
this
simple
thing
he
ever
lived
his
best
on
the
stage
every
move
was
one
of
unconscious
grace
those
of
his
company
who
were
conscious
of
their
motions
were
the
awkward
ones
who
were
seeking
in
public
to
undo
or
to
conceal
the
carelessness
of
the
gestures
and
motions
of
their
private
life
the
man
who
is
slipshod
and
thoughtless
in
his
daily
speech
whose
vocabulary
is
a
collection
of
anæmic
commonplaces
whose
repetitions
of
phrases
and
extravagance
of
interjections
act
but
as
feeble
disguises
to
his
lack
of
ideas
will
never
be
brilliant
on
an
occasion
when
he
longs
to
outshine
the
stars
living
at
one
s
best
is
constant
preparation
for
instant
use
it
can
never
make
one
affected
or
priggish
education
in
its
highest
sense
is
training
of
mind
or
body
to
act
it
is
conscious
formation
of
mental
habits
not
mere
acquisition
of
information
one
of
the
many
ways
in
which
the
individual
unwisely
eclipses
himself
is
in
his
worship
of
the
fetich
of
luck
he
feels
that
all
others
are
lucky
and
that
whatever
he
attempts
fails
he
does
not
realize
the
untiring
energy
the
unremitting
concentration
the
heroic
courage
the
sublime
patience
that
is
the
secret
of
some
men
s
success
their
luck
was
that
they
had
prepared
themselves
to
be
equal
to
their
opportunity
when
it
came
and
were
awake
to
recognize
it
and
receive
it
his
own
opportunity
came
and
departed
it
could
not
waken
him
from
his
dreams
of
some
untold
wealth
that
would
fall
into
his
lap
so
he
grows
discouraged
and
envies
those
whom
he
should
emulate
and
he
bandages
his
arms
and
chloroforms
his
energies
and
performs
his
duties
in
a
perfunctory
way
or
he
passes
through
life
just
ever
sampling
lines
of
activity
the
honest
faithful
struggler
should
always
realize
that
failure
is
but
an
episode
in
a
true
man
s
the
whole
story
it
is
never
easy
to
meet
and
no
philosophy
can
make
it
so
but
the
steadfast
courage
to
master
conditions
instead
of
complaining
of
them
will
help
him
on
his
way
it
will
ever
enable
him
to
get
the
best
out
of
what
he
has
he
never
knows
the
long
series
of
vanquished
failures
that
give
solidity
to
someone
else
s
success
he
does
not
realize
the
price
that
some
rich
man
the
innocent
football
of
political
malcontents
and
demagogues
has
heroically
paid
for
wealth
and
position
the
man
who
has
a
pessimist
s
doubt
of
all
things
who
demands
a
certified
guarantee
of
his
future
who
ever
fears
his
work
will
not
be
recognized
or
appreciated
or
that
after
all
it
is
really
not
worth
while
will
never
live
his
best
he
is
dulling
his
capacity
for
real
progress
by
his
hypnotic
course
of
excuses
for
inactivity
instead
of
a
strong
tonic
of
reasons
for
action

of
the
most
weakening
elements
in

one
of
the
greatest
statesmen
of
the
nineteenth
century
years
of
wealth
fame
honors
power
influence
prosperity
and
triumph
when
he
held
an
empire
in
his
fingers
not
one
day
of
happiness
happiness
is
the
greatest
paradox
in
nature
it
can
grow
in
any
soil
live
under
any
conditions
it
defies
environment
it
comes
from
within
it
is
the
revelation
of
the
depths
of
the
inner
life
as
light
and
heat
proclaim
the
sun
from
which
they
radiate
happiness
consists
not
of
having
but
of
being
not
of
possessing
but
of
enjoying
it
is
the
warm
glow
of
a
heart
at
peace
with
itself
a
martyr
at
the
stake
may
have
happiness
that
a
king
on
his
throne
might
envy
man
is
the
creator
of
his
own
happiness
it
is
the
aroma
of
a
life
lived
in
harmony
with
high
ideals
for
what
a
man
he
may
be
dependent
on
others
what
he
rests
with
him
alone
what
he
in
life
is
but
acquisition
what
he
is
growth
happiness
is
the
soul
s
joy
in
the
possession
of
the
intangible
absolute
perfect
continuous
happiness
in
life
is
impossible
for
the
human
it
would
mean
the
consummation
of
attainments
the
individual
consciousness
of
a
perfectly
fulfilled
destiny
happiness
is
paradoxic
because
it
may
coexist
with
trial
sorrow
and
poverty
it
is
the
gladness
of
the
heart
rising
superior
to
all
conditions
happiness
has
a
number
of
satisfaction
content
and
pleasure
imitators
that
simulate
its
appearance
rather
than
emulate
its
method
gratification
is
a
harmony
between
our
desires
and
our
possessions
it
is
ever
incomplete
it
is
the
thankful
acceptance
of
part
it
is
a
mental
pleasure
in
the
quality
of
what
one
receives
an
unsatisfiedness
as
to
the
quantity
it
may
be
an
element
in
happiness
but
in
itself
is
not
happiness
satisfaction
is
perfect
identity
of
our
desires
and
our
possessions
it
exists
only
so
long
as
this
perfect
union
and
unity
can
be
preserved
but
every
realized
ideal
gives
birth
to
new
ideals
every
step
in
advance
reveals
large
domains
of
the
unattained
every
feeding
stimulates
new
the
desires
and
possessions
are
no
longer
identical
no
longer
equal
new
cravings
call
forth
new
activities
the
equipoise
is
destroyed
and
dissatisfaction
reënters
man
might
possess
everything
tangible
in
the
world
and
yet
not
be
happy
for
happiness
is
the
satisfying
of
the
soul
not
of
the
mind
or
the
body
dissatisfaction
in
its
highest
sense
is
the
keynote
of
all
advance
the
evidence
of
new
aspirations
the
guarantee
of
the
progressive
revelation
of
new
possibilities
content
is
a
greatly
overrated
virtue
it
is
a
kind
of
diluted
despair
it
is
the
feeling
with
which
we
continue
to
accept
substitutes
without
striving
for
the
realities
content
makes
the
trained
individual
swallow
vinegar
and
try
to
smack
his
lips
as
if
it
were
wine
content
enables
one
to
warm
his
hands
at
the
fire
of
a
past
joy
that
exists
only
in
memory
content
is
a
mental
and
moral
chloroform
that
deadens
the
activities
of
the
individual
to
rise
to
higher
planes
of
life
and
growth
man
should
never
be
contented
with
anything
less
than
the
best
efforts
of
his
nature
can
possibly
secure
for
him
content
makes
the
world
more
comfortable
for
the
individual
but
it
is
the
of
progress
man
should
be
content
with
each
step
of
progress
merely
as
a
station
discontented
with
it
as
a
destination
contented
with
it
as
a
step
discontented
with
it
as
a
finality
there
are
times
when
a
man
should
be
content
with
what
he
but
never
with
what
he
but
content
is
not
happiness
neither
is
pleasure
pleasure
is
temporary
happiness
is
continuous
pleasure
is
a
note
happiness
is
a
symphony
pleasure
may
exist
when
conscience
utters
protests
happiness
never
pleasure
may
have
its
dregs
and
its
lees
but
none
can
be
found
in
the
cup
of
happiness
man
is
the
only
animal
that
can
be
really
happy
to
the
rest
of
the
creation
belong
only
weak
imitations
of
the
understudies
happiness
represents
a
peaceful
attunement
of
a
life
with
a
standard
of
living
it
can
never
be
made
by
the
individual
by
himself
for
himself
it
is
one
of
the
incidental
of
an
unselfish
life
no
man
can
make
his
own
happiness
the
one
object
of
his
life
and
attain
it
any
more
than
he
can
jump
on
the
far
end
of
his
shadow
if
you
would
hit
the
bull
of
happiness
on
the
target
of
life
aim
above
it
place
other
things
higher
than
your
own
happiness
and
it
will
surely
come
to
you
you
can
buy
pleasure
you
can
acquire
content
you
can
become
satisfied
nature
never
put
real
happiness
on
the
it
is
the
undetachable
accompaniment
of
true
living
it
is
calm
and
peaceful
it
never
lives
in
an
atmosphere
of
worry
or
of
hopeless
struggle
the
basis
of
happiness
is
the
love
of
something
outside
self
search
every
instance
of
happiness
in
the
world
and
you
will
find
when
all
the
incidental
features
are
eliminated
there
is
always
the
constant
unchangeable
element
of
love
of
parent
for
child
love
of
man
and
woman
for
each
other
love
of
humanity
in
some
form
or
a
great
life
work
into
which
the
individual
throws
all
his
energies
happiness
is
the
voice
of
optimism
of
faith
of
simple
steadfast
love
no
cynic
or
pessimist
can
be
really
happy
a
cynic
is
a
man
who
is
morally
brags
about
it
he
sees
the
evil
in
his
own
heart
and
thinks
he
sees
the
world
he
lets
a
mote
in
his
eye
eclipse
the
sun
an
incurable
cynic
is
an
individual
who
should
long
for
death
life
can
not
bring
him
happiness
death
might
the
keynote
of
bismarck
s
lack
of
happiness
was
his
profound
distrust
of
human
nature
there
is
a
royal
road
to
happiness
it
lies
in
consecration
concentration
conquest
and
conscience
consecration
is
dedicating
the
individual
life
to
the
service
of
others
to
some
noble
mission
to
realizing
some
unselfish
ideal
life
is
not
something
to
be
lived
it
is
something
to
be
lived
to
it
is
a
privilege
not
a
penal
servitude
of
so
many
decades
on
earth
consecration
places
the
object
of
life
above
the
mere
acquisition
of
money
as
a
finality
the
man
who
is
unselfish
kind
loving
tender
helpful
ready
to
lighten
the
burden
of
those
around
him
to
hearten
the
struggling
ones
to
forget
himself
sometimes
in
remembering
others
is
on
the
right
road
to
happiness
consecration
is
ever
active
bold
and
aggressive
fearing
naught
but
possible
disloyalty
to
high
ideals
concentration
makes
the
individual
life
simpler
and
deeper
it
cuts
away
the
shams
and
pretences
of
modern
living
and
limits
life
to
its
truest
essentials
worry
fear
useless
the
great
wastes
that
sap
mental
moral
or
physical
be
sacrificed
or
the
individual
needlessly
destroys
half
the
possibilities
of
living
a
great
purpose
in
life
something
that
unifies
the
strands
and
threads
of
each
day
s
thinking
something
that
takes
the
sting
from
the
petty
trials
sorrows
sufferings
and
blunders
of
life
is
a
great
aid
to
concentration
soldiers
in
battle
may
forget
their
wounds
or
even
be
unconscious
of
them
in
the
inspiration
of
battling
for
what
they
believe
is
right
concentration
dignifies
an
humble
life
it
makes
a
great
life
in
morals
it
is
a
to
simplicity
it
leads
to
right
for
right
s
sake
without
thought
of
policy
or
of
reward
it
brings
calm
and
rest
to
the
individual
serenity
that
is
but
the
sunlight
of
happiness
conquest
is
the
overcoming
of
an
evil
habit
the
rising
superior
to
opposition
and
attack
the
spiritual
exaltation
that
comes
from
resisting
the
invasion
of
the
grovelling
material
side
of
life
sometimes
when
you
are
worn
and
weak
with
the
struggle
when
it
seems
that
justice
is
a
dream
that
honesty
and
loyalty
and
truth
count
for
nothing
that
the
devil
is
the
only
good
paymaster
when
hope
grows
dim
and
flickers
then
is
the
time
when
you
must
tower
in
the
great
sublime
faith
that
right
must
prevail
then
must
you
throttle
these
imps
of
doubt
and
despair
you
must
master
yourself
to
master
the
world
around
you
this
is
conquest
this
is
what
counts
even
a
log
can
float
with
the
current
it
takes
a
man
to
fight
sturdily
against
an
opposing
tide
that
would
sweep
his
craft
out
of
its
course
when
the
jealousies
the
petty
intrigues
and
the
meannesses
and
the
misunderstandings
in
life
assail
you
rise
above
them
be
like
a
lighthouse
that
illumines
and
beautifies
the
snarling
swashing
waves
of
the
storm
that
threaten
it
that
seek
to
undermine
it
and
seek
to
wash
over
it
this
is
conquest
when
the
chance
to
win
fame
wealth
success
or
the
attainment
of
your
heart
s
desire
by
sacrifice
of
honor
or
principle
comes
to
you
and
it
does
not
affect
you
long
enough
even
to
seem
a
temptation
you
have
been
the
victor
that
too
is
conquest
and
conquest
is
part
of
the
royal
road
to
happiness
conscience
as
the
mentor
the
guide
and
compass
of
every
act
leads
ever
to
happiness
when
the
individual
can
stay
alone
with
his
conscience
and
get
its
approval
without
using
force
or
specious
logic
then
he
begins
to
know
what
real
happiness
is
but
the
individual
must
be
careful
that
he
is
not
appealing
to
a
conscience
perverted
or
deadened
by
the
wrongdoing
and
consequent
deafness
of
its
owner
the
man
who
is
honestly
seeking
to
live
his
life
in
consecration
concentration
and
conquest
living
from
day
to
day
as
best
he
can
by
the
light
he
has
may
rely
implicitly
on
his
conscience
he
can
shut
his
ears
to
what
the
world
says
and
find
in
the
approval
of
his
own
conscience
the
highest
earthly
voice
of
the
infinite
communing
with
the
individual
unhappiness
is
the
hunger
to
get
happiness
is
the
hunger
to
give
true
happiness
must
ever
have
the
tinge
of
sorrow
outlived
the
sense
of
pain
softened
by
the
mellowing
years
the
chastening
of
loss
that
in
the
wondrous
mystery
of
time
transmutes
our
suffering
into
love
and
sympathy
with
others
if
the
individual
should
set
out
for
a
single
day
to
give
happiness
to
make
life
happier
brighter
and
sweeter
not
for
himself
but
for
others
he
would
find
a
wondrous
revelation
of
what
happiness
really
is
the
greatest
of
the
world
s
heroes
could
not
by
any
series
of
acts
of
heroism
do
as
much
real
good
as
any
individual
living
his
whole
life
in
seeking
from
day
to
day
to
make
others
happy
each
day
there
should
be
fresh
resolution
new
strength
and
renewed
enthusiasm
just
for
might
be
the
daily
motto
of
thousands
of
societies
through
the
country
composed
of
members
bound
together
to
make
the
world
better
through
constant
simple
acts
of
kindness
constant
deeds
of
sweetness
and
love
and
happiness
would
come
to
them
in
its
highest
and
best
form
not
because
they
would
seek
to
it
they

to
it
