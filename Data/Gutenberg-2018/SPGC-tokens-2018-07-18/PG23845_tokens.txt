chapter
young
captain
bors
who
impatiently
refused
to
be
called
anything
else
was
strangely
occupied
when
the
communicator
buzzed
he
ripped
away
the
cord
about
a
thick
parcel
of
documents
and
heaved
them
into
the
fireplace
of
the
office
of
the
minister
for
diplomatic
affairs
a
fire
burned
there
and
already
there
were
many
ashes
the
carpet
and
the
chairs
of
the
cabinet
officer
sanctum
were
coated
with
fine
white
dust
as
the
communicator
buzzed
again
captain
bors
took
a
fireplace
tool
and
stirred
the
papers
to
looseness
they
caught
and
burned
instead
of
only
smouldering
the
communicator
buzzed
yet
again
he
brushed
off
his
hands
and
pressed
the
he
said
bleakly
diplomatic
affairs
bors
speaking
the
communicator
relayed
a
voice
from
somewhere
else
with
an
astonishing
fidelity
of
tone
sir
a
ship
just
broke
out
of
overdrive
we
do
identify
its
type
one
ship
only
bors
said
grimly
you
recognize
a
liner
if
it
a
ship
from
the
mekinese
fleet
and
stays
alone
it
could
be
coming
to
receive
our
surrender
in
that
case
play
for
time
and
notify
me
one
moment
it
calling
sir
here
it
is
there
was
a
clicking
and
then
there
came
a
voice
which
had
the
curious
quality
of
a
loudspeaker
sound
picked
up
and
relayed
through
another
loudspeaker
ground
calling
ground
sylva
arrival
and
asks
coordinates
for
landing
our
mass
is
two
hundred
tons
standard
purpose
of
visit
a
pause
the
voice
from
the
spaceport
captain
bors
said
impatiently
oh
let
him
down
and
see
if
he
knows
anything
about
the
mekinese
then
advise
him
to
go
away
at
once
tell
him
why
a
click
young
captain
bors
returned
to
his
task
of
burning
papers
these
were
the
confidential
records
of
the
ministry
for
diplomatic
affairs
captain
bors
wore
the
uniform
of
the
space
navy
of
the
planet
kandar
it
was
still
neatly
pressed
but
was
now
smudged
with
soot
and
smeared
with
ashes
he
had
burned
a
great
many
papers
today
elsewhere
in
the
ministry
other
men
were
burning
other
documents
the
other
papers
were
important
enough
they
were
confidential
reports
from
and
on
twenty
planets
in
the
hands
of
persons
they
could
bring
about
disaster
and
confusion
and
interplanetary
tension
but
the
ones
captain
bors
made
sure
of
were
deadly
he
burned
papers
telling
of
conditions
on
mekin
itself
the
authors
of
such
memoranda
would
be
savagely
punished
if
they
were
found
out
then
there
were
papers
telling
of
events
on
tralee
if
it
could
be
said
that
he
were
more
painstakingly
destructive
than
average
about
anything
captain
bors
was
about
them
he
saw
to
it
that
they
burned
to
ashes
he
crushed
the
ashes
he
stirred
them
it
would
be
unthinkable
that
such
morsels
could
ever
be
pieced
together
and
their
contents
even
guessed
at
he
went
on
with
the
work
his
jaunty
uniform
became
more
smeared
and
smudged
he
gave
himself
no
rest
there
were
papers
from
other
planets
now
under
the
hegemony
of
mekin
some
were
memoranda
from
citizens
of
this
planet
who
had
traveled
upon
the
worlds
which
mekin
dominated
as
it
was
about
to
dominate
kandar
they
especially
had
to
be
pulverized
every
confidential
document
in
the
ministry
for
diplomatic
affairs
was
in
the
process
of
destruction
but
captain
bors
in
person
destroyed
those
which
would
cause
most
suffering
if
read
by
the
wrong
persons
in
other
ministries
and
other
places
similar
holocausts
were
under
way
there
was
practically
nothing
going
on
on
kandar
which
was
not
related
to
the
disaster
for
which
the
people
of
that
world
waited
the
feel
of
bitterness
and
despair
was
everywhere
broadcasting
stations
stayed
on
the
air
only
to
report
monotonously
that
the
tragic
event
had
not
yet
happened
the
small
of
kandar
waited
aground
to
take
the
king
and
some
other
persons
on
board
at
the
last
moment
when
the
mekinese
navy
arrived
or
as
much
of
it
as
was
needed
to
make
resistance
hopeless
the
end
for
kandar
would
have
come
that
was
the
impending
disaster
if
it
came
too
soon
bors
task
of
destruction
could
be
completed
as
was
wished
in
such
a
case
this
ministry
and
all
the
others
would
hastily
be
doused
with
incendiary
material
and
fired
and
it
would
desperately
be
hoped
that
all
the
planet
records
went
up
in
the
flames
captain
bors
flung
more
and
more
papers
on
the
blaze
he
came
to
an
end
of
them
the
communicator
buzzed
again
he
answered
once
more
the
sylva
landed
it
comes
from
norden
and
has
no
direct
information
about
the
mekinese
but
there
a
man
named
morgan
with
a
very
important
letter
for
the
minister
for
diplomatic
affairs
it
from
the
minister
for
diplomatic
affairs
on
bors
said
sardonically
maybe
he
should
wait
a
few
days
or
hours
and
give
it
to
the
mekinese
send
him
over
if
he
wants
to
take
the
chance
but
warn
him
not
to
let
anybody
from
his
yacht
leave
the
spaceport
bors
made
a
quick
circuit
of
the
ministry
building
to
make
sure
the
rest
of
the
destruction
was
thoroughly
carried
out
he
glanced
out
of
a
window
and
saw
the
other
ministries
from
their
chimneys
thick
smoke
poured
out
the
criminal
records
were
being
incinerated
in
the
ministry
of
police
tax
records
were
burning
in
the
ministry
of
finance
educational
information
about
kandarian
citizens
flamed
and
smoked
in
the
ministry
of
education
even
voting
and
lists
were
being
wiped
out
of
existence
by
flames
and
the
crushing
of
ashes
at
appropriate
agencies
the
planet
banks
were
completing
the
distribution
of
coin
and
currency
with
promissory
notes
to
those
depositors
they
could
not
pay
in
full
and
the
registers
were
open
so
individuals
could
remove
and
hide
or
destroy
their
titles
to
property
the
stockholders
books
of
corporations
were
being
burned
small
ships
parted
with
their
wares
and
took
promises
of
payment
in
return
the
planet
kandar
in
fact
made
ready
to
receive
its
conquerors
it
was
not
conquered
yet
but
there
could
be
no
hope
bors
was
in
the
act
of
brushing
off
his
hands
again
in
a
sort
of
symbolic
gesture
of
completion
when
a
stopped
before
the
ministry
a
stout
man
got
out
a
rather
startlingly
pretty
girl
followed
they
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
ministry
presently
captain
bors
received
the
two
visitors
his
uniform
looked
like
a
dustman
he
was
much
more
grim
than
anybody
his
age
should
ever
be
your
name
is
morgan
he
said
formidably
to
the
stout
man
you
have
a
letter
for
the
minister
he
not
here
he
gathering
up
his
family
if
anyone
in
charge
i
am
the
stout
man
cheerfully
handed
over
a
very
official
envelope
bors
said
caustically
i
do
ask
you
to
sit
down
because
covered
with
excuse
me
he
tore
open
the
envelope
and
read
its
contents
his
impatience
increased
in
normal
times
he
said
i
sure
this
would
be
most
interesting
but
these
are
not
normal
times
i
afraid
i
know
i
know
said
the
stout
man
exuberantly
if
times
were
normal
i
would
be
here
i
president
and
executive
director
of
talents
incorporated
from
that
letter
you
see
that
we
done
very
remarkable
things
for
different
governments
and
businesses
i
like
to
talk
to
someone
with
the
authority
to
make
a
policy
decision
i
want
to
show
what
we
can
do
for
you
it
too
late
to
do
anything
for
us
said
bors
much
too
late
we
expect
the
mekinese
fleet
at
any
instant
you
better
go
back
to
the
spaceport
and
take
off
in
your
yacht
they
going
to
take
over
this
planet
after
a
slight
tumult
we
expect
to
arrange
you
wo
want
to
be
here
when
they
come
morgan
waved
a
hand
negligently
they
wo
arrive
for
four
days
he
said
confidently
that
talents
incorporated
information
you
can
depend
on
it
there
plenty
of
time
to
prepare
before
they
get
here
he
smiled
as
if
at
a
joke
young
captain
bors
was
not
impressed
he
and
all
the
other
officers
of
the
kandarian
defense
forces
had
searched
desperately
for
something
that
could
be
done
to
avert
the
catastrophe
before
them
they
failed
to
find
even
the
promise
of
a
hope
he
could
be
encouraged
by
the
confidence
of
a
total
stranger
and
a
civilian
to
boot
he
taken
refuge
in
anger
the
pretty
girl
said
suddenly
captain
at
least
we
can
reassure
you
on
one
thing
your
government
chartered
four
big
liners
to
remove
government
officials
and
citizens
who
be
on
the
mekinese
black
list
you
worried
for
fear
they
wo
get
here
in
time
but
my
father
the
stout
man
looked
at
his
watch
ah
yes
you
do
want
the
fleet
cluttered
up
with
civilians
when
it
takes
to
space
i
happy
to
tell
you
it
wo
be
the
first
of
your
four
liners
will
break
out
of
overdrive
in
hm
three
minutes
twenty
seconds
two
others
will
arrive
tomorrow
one
at
ten
minutes
after
noon
the
other
three
hours
later
the
last
will
arrive
the
day
after
at
about
sunrise
here
bors
went
a
trifle
pale
i
doubt
it
it
supposed
to
be
a
military
secret
that
such
ships
are
on
the
way
since
you
know
it
i
assume
that
the
mekinese
do
too
in
effect
you
seem
to
be
a
mekinese
spy
but
you
can
hardly
do
any
more
harm
i
advise
you
to
go
back
to
your
yacht
and
leave
kandar
immediately
if
our
citizens
find
out
you
are
spies
they
will
literally
tear
you
to
pieces
he
looked
at
them
icily
the
stout
man
grinned
listen
your
h
captain
listen
to
me
the
first
liner
will
report
inside
of
five
minutes
that
be
a
test
here
another
there
a
mekinese
heavy
cruiser
aground
on
kandar
right
now
it
on
the
sea
bottom
fifty
fathoms
down
five
miles
magnetic
from
cape
farnell
you
can
check
that
the
cruiser
down
there
to
lob
a
fusion
bomb
into
your
when
it
starts
to
take
off
for
the
flight
you
planning
to
get
all
the
important
men
on
kandar
in
one
smash
that
talents
incorporated
information
it
a
free
sample
you
can
verify
it
without
it
costing
you
anything
and
when
you
want
more
and
better
information
why
we
be
at
the
spaceport
ready
to
give
it
to
you
and
you
will
want
to
call
on
us
that
talents
incorporated
information
too
he
turned
and
marched
confidently
almost
grandly
out
of
the
room
the
girl
smiled
faintly
at
bors
he
left
out
something
captain
that
cruiser
it
could
hardly
act
without
information
on
when
to
act
so
there
a
pair
of
spies
in
a
little
shack
on
the
cape
they
got
an
underwater
cable
going
under
the
sand
beach
and
out
and
down
to
the
they
watching
the
fleet
on
the
ground
with
telescopes
when
they
see
activity
around
it
they
tell
the
cruiser
what
to
do
then
she
smiled
more
broadly
honestly
it
true
and
do
forget
about
the
liner
she
followed
her
father
out
of
the
room
outside
as
they
got
into
the
waiting
she
said
to
her
father
if
he
smiled
i
think
like
him
but
bors
did
not
know
that
at
the
time
he
would
probably
not
have
paid
any
attention
if
he
had
kandar
was
about
to
be
taken
over
by
the
mekinese
as
his
own
tralee
had
been
ten
years
before
and
other
planets
before
that
mekin
was
making
an
empire
after
an
ancient
tradition
which
scorned
the
idea
of
incorporating
other
worlds
into
its
own
governmental
system
which
was
appalling
but
merely
made
them
subjects
and
satellites
and
tributaries
bors
had
been
born
on
tralee
which
he
remembered
as
a
tranquil
world
of
glamor
and
happiness
but
he
was
on
kandar
now
he
served
in
its
and
he
foresaw
kandar
becoming
what
tralee
had
become
he
felt
such
hatred
and
rebellion
toward
mekin
that
he
could
not
notice
a
pretty
girl
he
was
getting
ready
for
the
savage
last
battle
of
the
of
kandar
which
would
fight
in
the
great
void
until
it
was
annihilated
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
if
one
was
not
to
submit
to
the
arrogant
tyranny
that
already
lorded
it
over
subject
planets
and
might
extend
itself
indefinitely
throughout
the
galaxy
he
moved
to
verify
again
the
complete
pulverizing
of
the
ashes
in
the
fireplace
the
communicator
buzzed
he
pressed
the
answer
button
a
voice
said
the
vestis
breakout
from
overdrive
now
driving
for
port
message
bors
eyes
popped
wide
he
heard
exactly
that
only
minutes
ago
it
could
be
coincidence
but
it
was
a
very
remarkable
one
the
man
morgan
had
come
to
him
to
tell
him
that
if
he
come
for
some
other
reason
and
merely
made
a
guess
it
could
be
coincidence
but
he
come
only
to
tell
bors
that
he
could
be
useful
and
it
was
impossible
at
a
to
know
when
a
ship
would
break
out
of
overdrive
einstein
data
on
the
anomalies
of
time
at
speeds
near
that
of
light
naturally
did
not
apply
to
overdrive
speeds
above
it
nobody
could
conceivably
predict
when
a
ship
from
many
away
would
arrive
but
morgan
had
it
was
impossible
he
said
something
else
that
was
impossible
too
he
said
there
was
a
mekinese
cruiser
on
the
of
kandar
where
it
could
blast
all
the
local
fleet
which
was
ready
to
fight
but
vulnerable
to
a
single
if
such
a
thing
happened
the
impending
disaster
would
be
worse
than
intolerable
to
bors
it
would
mean
dying
without
a
chance
to
strike
even
the
most
futile
of
blows
at
the
enemy
he
hesitated
a
long
minute
morgan
errand
had
been
to
make
a
prediction
and
give
a
warning
to
gain
credence
for
what
he
could
do
later
the
prediction
was
fulfilled
but
the
warning
an
enemy
cruiser
in
ambush
on
kandar
was
a
possibility
that
simply
had
been
considered
had
even
occurred
to
anyone
but
once
it
was
mentioned
it
seemed
horribly
likely
there
was
no
time
for
a
search
at
random
but
if
morgan
had
been
right
about
one
thing
he
might
have
some
way
to
know
about
another
bors
gave
curt
orders
to
his
subordinates
in
the
work
of
he
went
out
of
the
building
to
the
greensward
mall
that
lay
between
the
ministries
of
the
government
and
headed
for
the
palace
at
its
end
the
government
of
kandar
was
not
one
of
great
pomp
and
display
there
was
a
king
to
be
sure
but
nobody
could
imagine
the
perspiringly
earnest
king
humphrey
the
eighth
as
a
tyrant
there
were
titles
it
was
true
but
they
were
life
appointments
to
the
legislative
upper
house
kandar
was
a
tranquil
quaint
and
very
happy
world
there
were
few
industries
and
those
were
small
nobody
was
unduly
rich
and
most
of
its
people
were
contented
it
was
a
world
with
no
history
of
bloodshed
until
now
bors
brushed
absently
at
his
uniform
as
he
walked
the
two
hundred
yards
to
the
palace
he
abstractedly
acknowledged
the
sentries
salutes
as
he
entered
much
of
the
palace
guard
had
been
sent
away
and
most
of
the
palace
small
staff
would
hide
from
the
mekinese
the
aggressors
had
a
nasty
habit
of
imposing
special
humiliations
upon
citizens
who
been
prominent
before
they
were
conquered
he
went
unannounced
into
king
humphrey
study
where
the
monarch
conferred
dispiritedly
with
captain
bors
uncle
the
exiled
pretender
of
tralee
who
listened
with
interest
the
king
was
talking
doggedly
to
his
old
friend
no
you
mistaken
you
have
my
written
order
to
distribute
the
bullion
in
the
treasury
to
all
the
cities
to
be
shared
as
evenly
as
possible
by
all
the
people
the
mekinese
ca
blame
you
for
obeying
an
order
of
your
lawful
king
before
they
unlawfully
seize
the
kingdom
captain
bors
said
curtly
majesty
the
first
of
the
four
liners
is
in
two
more
will
arrive
tomorrow
and
the
last
at
sunrise
the
day
after
the
mekinese
will
be
here
two
days
later
king
humphrey
and
captain
bors
uncle
stared
at
him
and
said
bors
the
same
source
of
information
says
there
a
mekinese
cruiser
waiting
underwater
off
cape
farnell
to
lob
a
fusion
bomb
at
the
fleet
as
it
ready
to
lift
king
humphrey
said
but
nobody
can
possibly
know
that
two
liners
will
come
tomorrow
one
hopes
so
of
course
but
one
ca
know
as
for
a
cruiser
submerged
there
been
no
report
of
it
the
information
said
captain
bors
came
from
talents
incorporated
it
sample
information
given
free
the
first
item
has
checked
he
came
with
a
letter
from
a
cabinet
minister
on
norden
bors
handed
it
to
the
pretender
of
tralee
mmmm
he
said
thoughtfully
i
heard
of
this
talents
incorporated
and
on
norden
too
phillip
of
norden
mentioned
it
to
me
a
man
named
morgan
had
told
him
that
talents
incorporated
had
secured
information
that
an
atom
bomb
a
fission
bomb
as
i
remember
and
quite
small
had
been
set
to
assassinate
him
as
he
laid
a
cornerstone
the
information
turned
out
to
be
correct
phillip
of
norden
and
some
thousands
of
his
subjects
would
have
been
killed
the
assassins
were
really
going
to
extremes
as
i
remember
morgan
would
accept
money
for
the
warning
he
accept
a
medal
i
think
said
bors
i
think
i
shall
investigate
what
he
said
about
a
mekinese
ship
in
hiding
you
no
objection
majesty
king
humphrey
the
eighth
looked
at
the
pretender
one
was
remarkably
unlike
the
other
the
king
was
short
and
stocky
and
resolute
as
if
to
overcome
his
own
shortcomings
the
pretender
was
lean
and
gray
with
the
mild
look
of
a
man
who
has
schooled
himself
to
patience
under
frustration
he
nodded
king
humphrey
shook
his
head
very
well
said
bors
i
borrow
a
flier
and
see
about
it
he
left
the
palace
there
was
already
disorganization
everywhere
the
planetary
government
was
in
process
of
destroying
all
the
machinery
by
which
kandar
had
been
governed
as
if
to
make
the
mekinese
improvise
a
government
anew
they
would
make
many
blunders
of
course
which
would
be
resented
by
their
new
subjects
there
would
be
much
fumbling
which
would
keep
the
victims
of
their
conquest
from
regarding
them
with
respect
and
there
would
be
the
small
tumult
bors
had
said
was
in
preparation
the
king
and
the
kandarian
fleet
would
fight
quite
hopelessly
and
to
their
own
annihilation
when
the
mekinese
fleet
appeared
it
would
be
something
kandar
would
always
remember
it
was
likely
that
she
would
not
be
the
most
docile
of
the
worlds
conquered
by
mekin
the
mekinese
would
always
and
everywhere
be
resented
but
on
kandar
they
would
also
be
despised
bors
found
the
which
waited
to
carry
the
king
and
those
who
would
accompany
him
to
the
fleet
when
the
time
came
he
commandeered
a
and
a
driver
he
ordered
himself
driven
to
the
base
of
the
fleet
on
the
way
the
driver
spoke
apologetically
captain
sir
i
like
to
say
something
say
it
said
bors
i
sorry
sir
but
i
got
a
wife
and
children
even
for
their
sakes
sir
i
mean
if
it
was
for
them
i
i
be
going
with
the
fleet
i
wanted
to
explain
why
you
staying
alive
asked
bors
you
should
feel
apologetic
getting
killed
in
the
fleet
ought
to
follow
at
least
the
killing
of
a
few
mekinese
there
should
be
some
satisfaction
in
that
but
if
you
stay
here
your
troubles
still
wo
be
over
and
there
be
very
little
satisfaction
in
what
you
go
through
what
the
fleet
will
do
will
be
dramatic
what
you
do
wo
you
have
the
less
satisfying
role
i
think
the
fleet
is
taking
the
easy
way
out
the
driver
was
silent
for
a
long
time
as
he
drove
along
the
strangely
unfrequented
highways
just
before
the
reached
the
air
base
he
said
awkwardly
thank
you
sir
when
he
brought
the
car
to
a
stop
he
got
out
quickly
to
offer
a
very
stiff
military
salute
bors
went
inside
he
found
men
with
burning
eyes
conferring
feverishly
an
air
force
colonel
said
urgently
sir
please
advise
us
we
have
our
orders
but
there
nearly
a
mutiny
we
do
want
to
turn
anything
over
to
the
mekinese
after
all
no
matter
what
the
king
has
commanded
once
the
fleet
had
lifted
off
there
can
be
no
punishment
if
we
destroy
our
planes
and
blast
our
equipment
will
you
give
us
an
unofficial
bors
broke
in
quickly
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
a
chance
at
a
mekinese
cruiser
can
you
lend
me
a
plane
with
civilian
markings
and
a
pilot
who
a
good
photographer
i
need
a
magnetometer
to
trail
too
there
a
rather
urgent
situation
coming
up
the
men
stared
at
him
he
explained
the
possibility
of
a
mekinese
lying
in
fifty
fathoms
off
cape
farnell
he
did
not
say
where
the
information
came
from
even
to
men
as
desperate
as
these
talents
incorporated
information
would
not
seem
credible
without
painstaking
explanation
bors
was
by
no
means
sure
that
he
believed
it
himself
but
he
wanted
to
so
fiercely
that
he
sounded
as
if
some
mekinese
spy
or
traitor
had
confessed
it
the
feeling
of
tenseness
multiplied
but
voices
grew
very
quiet
no
man
spoke
an
unnecessary
word
in
minutes
they
had
made
complete
arrangements
when
the
took
off
down
the
runway
wholly
deceptive
explanations
were
already
being
made
it
was
said
that
the
were
to
load
bombs
for
demolition
because
the
king
was
being
asked
for
permission
to
bomb
all
mines
and
bridges
and
railways
and
docks
that
would
make
kandar
a
valuable
addition
to
the
mekinese
empire
everything
was
to
be
destroyed
before
the
conquerors
came
to
ground
the
destruction
would
bring
hardship
to
the
citizens
so
the
story
admitted
but
the
mekinese
would
bring
that
anyhow
and
they
should
profit
by
what
kandar
people
had
built
for
themselves
the
point
was
of
course
to
get
bombloads
aboard
planes
with
no
chance
of
suspicion
by
spy
or
traitor
of
the
actual
use
intended
for
them
meanwhile
bors
flew
in
an
which
looked
like
a
private
ship
and
explained
his
intentions
to
the
pilot
so
that
the
small
plane
did
not
go
directly
to
the
spot
five
miles
offshore
that
the
mysterious
visitors
had
mentioned
to
make
an
examination
of
the
sea
bottom
instead
it
flew
southward
it
did
not
swing
out
to
sea
for
nearly
fifty
miles
it
went
out
until
it
was
on
a
line
between
a
certain
small
island
where
many
people
had
homes
and
the
airport
of
the
capital
city
then
it
headed
for
that
airport
it
flew
slowly
as
civilian
planes
do
by
the
time
the
sandy
beaches
of
a
cape
appeared
it
was
quite
convincingly
a
private
plane
bringing
someone
from
a
residential
island
to
the
airport
of
kandar
city
if
a
small
object
trailed
below
it
barely
above
the
waves
suspended
by
the
thinnest
of
wires
it
was
invisible
if
the
plane
happened
to
be
on
a
course
that
would
pass
above
a
spot
from
the
tip
of
the
cape
a
spot
calculated
from
information
given
by
talents
incorporated
it
seemed
entirely
coincidental
nobody
could
have
suspected
anything
unusual
certainly
nothing
likely
to
upset
the
plans
of
a
murderous
totalitarian
enemy
one
small
and
insignificant
civilian
plane
be
able
to
prevent
the
murder
of
a
a
king
and
the
most
resolute
members
of
a
planet
population
captain
bors
flew
the
ship
the
official
pilot
used
an
electron
camera
giving
a
complete
and
overlapping
series
of
pictures
of
the
shore
five
miles
away
with
incredible
magnification
and
detail
the
flicked
over
its
findings
were
recorded
as
the
plane
went
on
it
returned
to
a
normal
reading
for
fifty
fathoms
of
seawater
half
an
hour
later
the
seemingly
private
plane
landed
at
the
capital
airport
another
and
its
record
and
pictures
were
back
at
the
air
base
being
examined
and
computed
by
men
just
as
the
pretty
morgan
girl
had
said
there
was
a
shack
on
the
very
tip
of
the
cape
it
was
occupied
by
two
men
they
loafed
and
only
an
electron
camera
could
have
used
enough
magnification
to
show
one
man
laughing
as
if
at
something
the
other
had
said
the
camera
proved
from
five
miles
away
that
there
was
no
sadness
afflicting
them
one
man
laughed
uproariously
but
the
rest
of
the
planet
was
in
no
mood
for
laughter
the
magnetometer
recording
showed
that
a
very
large
mass
of
magnetic
material
lay
on
the
ocean
bottom
fifty
fathoms
down
minute
modifications
of
the
curve
showed
that
there
was
electronic
machinery
in
operation
down
below
bors
made
no
report
to
the
palace
king
humphrey
was
a
conscientious
and
doggedly
resolute
monarch
but
he
was
not
an
imaginative
one
he
would
want
to
hold
a
cabinet
meeting
before
he
issued
orders
for
the
destruction
of
a
that
was
only
technically
and
not
actually
an
enemy
kandar
had
received
an
ultimatum
from
mekin
an
answer
was
required
when
a
mekinese
fleet
arrived
off
kandar
until
that
moment
there
was
in
theory
no
war
but
in
fact
kandar
was
already
conquered
in
every
respect
except
the
landing
of
mekinese
on
its
surface
king
humphrey
however
would
want
to
observe
all
the
rules
and
there
might
not
be
time
the
air
force
agreed
with
bors
so
squadron
after
squadron
took
off
from
the
airfield
on
courses
which
had
certain
things
in
common
none
of
them
would
pass
over
a
fisherman
shack
on
cape
farnell
none
could
pass
over
a
spot
five
miles
magnetic
from
that
tip
where
the
bottom
was
fifty
fathoms
down
and
a
suspicious
magnetic
condition
obtained
one
more
thing
unified
the
flying
squadrons
at
a
given
instant
all
of
them
could
turn
and
dive
toward
that
depth
at
sea
and
they
would
arrive
in
swift
and
orderly
succession
this
last
arrangement
was
a
brilliant
piece
of
men
had
worked
with
impassioned
dedication
to
bring
it
about
but
only
these
men
knew
there
was
no
sign
anywhere
of
anything
more
remarkable
than
winged
squadrons
sweeping
in
a
seemingly
routine
exercise
about
the
heavens
even
so
they
were
not
visible
from
the
cape
the
horizon
hid
them
for
a
long
time
there
was
only
blueness
overhead
and
the
salt
smell
of
the
sea
and
now
and
again
flights
of
small
birds
which
had
no
memory
of
the
flight
of
their
ancestors
from
ancient
earth
the
planet
kandar
rolled
grandly
in
space
awaiting
its
destiny
the
sun
shone
the
sun
set
in
another
place
it
was
midnight
and
at
still
another
it
was
early
dawn
but
from
the
high
blue
sky
near
the
planet
capital
there
came
a
stuttering
as
of
a
motor
going
bad
if
anyone
looked
a
most
minute
angular
dot
could
be
seen
to
be
fighting
to
get
back
over
the
land
from
where
it
had
first
appeared
far
out
at
sea
there
were
moments
when
the
stuttering
ceased
and
the
engine
ran
with
a
smooth
hum
then
another
stutter
the
plane
lost
altitude
it
was
clear
that
its
pilot
fought
to
make
solid
ground
before
it
crashed
twice
it
seemed
definitely
lost
but
each
time
at
the
last
instant
the
motor
purred
and
popped
and
the
plane
rose
valiantly
then
there
was
a
detonation
the
plane
staggered
its
pilot
fought
and
fought
but
his
craft
had
no
power
at
all
it
came
down
fluttering
with
the
pilot
gaining
every
imaginable
inch
toward
the
sandy
shore
it
seemed
certain
that
he
would
come
down
on
the
white
beach
unharmed
a
good
from
the
fisherman
shack
on
the
cape
but
perhaps
it
was
a
gust
of
wind
it
may
have
been
something
more
premeditated
one
wing
flew
wildly
up
the
flier
seemed
to
plunge
crazily
groundward
at
the
last
fraction
of
a
second
the
plane
reeled
again
and
crashed
into
the
fisherman
shack
before
which
from
a
distance
of
five
miles
a
man
had
been
photographed
laughing
timbers
splintered
glass
broke
musically
then
there
were
thuds
as
men
leaped
swiftly
from
the
plane
and
dived
under
the
there
were
three
four
half
a
dozen
men
in
fleet
uniforms
with
blasters
in
their
hands
they
used
the
weapons
ruthlessly
upon
a
civilian
who
flung
himself
at
an
incongruously
signalling
apparatus
in
a
corner
of
the
shattered
house
a
second
man
snarled
and
savagely
lunged
at
his
attackers
he
was
also
blasted
as
he
tried
to
reach
the
same
device
there
was
no
pause
over
the
low
ground
to
the
west
a
flight
of
bombers
appeared
bellowing
in
mass
formation
they
rushed
out
above
the
sea
far
to
the
right
and
high
up
a
second
formation
of
birds
appeared
suddenly
it
dived
steeply
from
invisibility
toward
the
water
over
the
horizon
to
the
left
there
came
v
of
one
after
another
by
dozens
and
by
hundreds
more
planes
roared
above
the
shattered
shack
they
came
in
columns
they
came
in
masses
from
the
heavens
above
and
over
the
ground
below
and
from
the
horizon
that
rimmed
the
world
the
planes
came
planes
from
one
direction
crossed
a
certain
patch
of
sea
they
were
not
wholly
clear
of
it
when
planes
from
another
part
of
the
horizon
swept
over
the
same
area
barely
high
planes
from
the
west
raced
over
this
one
delimited
space
and
planes
from
the
north
almost
shouldered
them
aside
and
then
planes
from
the
east
covered
that
same
patch
of
sea
and
then
more
planes
from
the
south
they
followed
each
other
in
incredible
procession
incredibly
precise
the
water
on
that
space
developed
white
dots
which
always
vanished
but
never
ceased
leaped
up
three
feet
or
ten
or
twenty
and
disappeared
and
then
there
were
others
which
spouted
up
one
yard
or
two
or
ten
there
were
innumerable
temporary
whitecaps
the
surface
became
pale
from
the
constant
churning
of
new
before
the
old
foam
died
then
with
absolute
abruptness
the
planes
flew
away
from
the
one
square
mile
of
sea
the
climbed
steeply
abruptly
behind
them
there
were
warning
booms
then
monstrous
masses
of
spray
and
bubbles
and
blue
water
leaped
up
three
hundred
feet
four
hundred
feet
five
a
square
mile
of
ocean
erupted
as
the
planes
climbed
up
and
away
from
it
there
were
bombs
in
the
ocean
some
had
sunk
down
deep
others
followed
in
close
succession
many
many
burdens
of
bombs
had
been
dropped
into
the
sea
as
after
went
by
the
sea
exploded
in
monstrous
columns
ton
and
bombs
began
to
detonate
fifty
fathoms
down
the
mekinese
below
had
just
learned
that
the
spies
signalling
device
was
cut
off
when
a
detonation
lifted
the
hull
of
the
mekinese
cruiser
and
shook
it
violently
another
twisted
its
tail
and
crushed
it
a
bomb
hit
sea
bottom
a
away
more
bombs
exploded
still
nearer
in
close
contact
with
the
giant
hull
a
bomb
clanked
into
contact
with
its
metal
plating
and
burst
the
cruiser
cowering
thrust
over
the
which
would
put
the
ship
through
commands
faster
than
orders
could
be
spoken
rockets
flared
deep
under
water
but
the
flames
set
off
bombs
and
the
cracked
and
were
useless
a
midship
compartment
was
flooding
a
forward
compartment
wall
caved
in
and
still
bombs
burst
the
skipper
of
the
assassin
cruiser
screamed
an
order
to
fire
all
missiles
they
were
already
set
on
target
they
were
for
the
spot
where
the
of
kandar
waited
to
rise
they
did
not
one
missile
was
blasted
as
the
cover
of
its
opened
another
was
blown
in
half
when
partly
out
of
its
tube
and
a
third
actually
rammed
a
sinking
bomb
and
vanished
with
it
when
it
exploded
the
huge
thing
under
the
sea
heaved
itself
up
blindly
it
reached
the
surface
but
it
was
shattered
and
rent
and
dying
and
planes
dived
vengefully
upon
it
and
blasted
apart
whatever
could
be
seen
in
the
roaring
foam
so
the
blinded
suffering
thing
of
metal
only
emptied
itself
of
air
and
went
down
to
the
bottom
again
where
more
bombs
ripped
and
tore
it
the
of
kandar
swung
in
a
gigantic
ballooning
circle
about
the
spot
where
they
had
dropped
a
good
fraction
of
a
ton
of
bombs
to
the
square
yard
but
nothing
stirred
there
any
more
still
the
planes
flew
in
a
great
deadly
band
about
it
until
a
flitterboat
came
out
from
shore
and
lowered
a
camera
and
a
light
by
long
long
cords
there
was
no
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
there
was
evidence
of
one
yes
there
were
patches
of
plating
and
there
were
naked
twisted
girders
the
dangling
underwater
camera
faithfully
reported
what
it
saw
by
the
light
that
was
lowered
with
it
but
there
was
no
there
were
only
the
rather
small
fragments
of
what
had
been
one
a
little
while
before
captain
bors
went
back
to
the
palace
he
was
savagely
pleased
he
and
the
men
had
done
something
they
had
some
satisfaction
they
killed
some
mekinese
and
ruined
a
plan
to
assassinate
the
kandar
fleet
but
they
only
gotten
an
immediate
satisfaction
kandar
was
still
to
be
conquered
nothing
important
had
changed
bors
made
his
way
to
the
king
study
he
entered
king
humphrey
the
eighth
and
the
pretender
of
tralee
were
listening
doubtfully
to
a
stout
man
the
man
was
morgan
he
stopped
talking
and
blinked
at
captain
bors
the
captain
ignored
royal
etiquette
and
spoke
to
him
without
first
greeting
the
king
the
ship
was
there
as
you
said
we
smashed
it
thank
you
is
there
any
more
information
you
can
give
us
chapter
at
the
spaceport
carefully
selected
persons
filed
onto
the
it
was
not
officially
believed
that
the
other
three
great
chartered
ships
would
arrive
before
the
mekinese
fleet
it
was
in
fact
rather
likely
that
none
of
the
information
given
by
talents
incorporated
was
ever
believed
until
the
event
confirmed
the
prediction
in
the
case
of
the
first
liner
those
who
went
on
board
had
been
chosen
by
a
strict
principle
of
priority
men
who
would
merely
be
imprisoned
when
mekin
took
over
had
no
privilege
of
escape
not
yet
those
who
were
destined
for
execution
as
soon
as
a
quisling
government
was
formed
were
also
not
entitled
to
depart
on
the
liner
but
those
who
had
conspicuously
supported
king
humphrey
in
his
resistance
to
intimidation
those
who
had
encouraged
others
to
object
to
concessions
which
could
only
be
forerunners
of
other
concessions
those
who
had
spoken
and
written
and
labored
to
spread
information
about
the
facts
of
life
under
mekin
would
not
merely
be
imprisoned
or
executed
they
would
be
tortured
so
they
were
entitled
to
first
chance
at
escape
the
blasted
off
some
six
hours
after
its
arrival
it
vanished
blessedly
into
overdrive
where
it
could
not
be
intercepted
it
headed
for
the
world
of
trent
where
its
passengers
would
be
allowed
to
land
as
refugees
and
where
doubtless
they
would
speak
bitterly
about
mekin
for
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
but
the
government
of
mekin
would
not
care
mekin
was
a
phenomenon
so
improbable
that
only
those
who
were
students
of
past
civilizations
could
really
believe
it
there
were
innumerable
references
to
such
régimes
in
the
histories
of
ancient
earth
there
was
for
example
napoleon
said
people
informed
about
such
matters
with
a
fraction
of
a
fraction
of
one
per
cent
of
the
french
people
actively
cooperating
he
overawed
the
rest
and
then
took
over
a
nation
which
was
not
even
his
own
then
he
took
over
other
nations
where
less
than
a
fraction
of
a
fraction
of
one
per
cent
concurred
then
he
took
soldiers
from
those
conquests
to
make
conquests
and
then
soldiers
from
the
third
to
make
fourth
there
was
mussolini
said
the
learned
men
he
had
organized
a
group
of
rowdies
and
gangsters
and
began
by
levying
on
and
even
less
reputable
resorts
and
with
the
money
increased
his
following
he
had
murdered
those
who
opposed
him
and
presently
he
collected
protection
money
from
even
the
great
business
corporations
of
his
country
financing
more
political
gangsterism
until
he
ruled
his
nation
for
himself
and
his
confederates
and
there
was
hitler
said
the
in
the
beginning
his
followers
never
dared
show
themselves
in
the
uniforms
they
adopted
because
their
hated
everything
they
stood
for
but
before
the
end
came
they
worshipped
him
they
murdered
millions
at
his
command
but
they
died
because
of
him
too
there
was
lenin
and
there
was
stalin
specialists
in
history
could
talk
very
learnedly
about
the
developments
on
mekin
which
paralleled
the
cabals
headed
by
lenin
and
later
stalin
theirs
was
a
much
more
durable
organization
than
those
of
napoleon
and
mussolini
and
hitler
the
ruling
clique
on
mekin
had
begun
in
this
manner
mekin
had
once
had
a
cause
to
which
all
its
officials
paid
and
some
possibly
believed
in
because
of
this
cause
it
was
the
organization
and
not
the
individual
who
was
apotheosized
therefore
there
could
be
fierce
battles
among
members
of
the
ruling
class
there
could
be
conspiracies
the
last
three
dictators
of
mekin
had
been
murdered
in
palace
revolutions
and
the
current
dictator
was
more
elaborately
protected
from
his
confreres
than
any
mere
hereditary
tyrant
ever
needed
to
be
but
mekin
remained
a
strong
and
dynamic
world
engaged
in
the
endless
subjugation
of
other
worlds
for
a
purpose
nobody
really
remembered
any
more
against
such
a
society
a
planet
like
kandar
was
helpless
mekin
could
not
be
placated
nor
satisfied
with
less
than
the
subjugation
and
the
ruin
of
its
neighbors
for
a
time
kandar
had
tried
to
arm
for
its
own
defense
it
had
a
which
in
quality
was
probably
equal
to
mekin
but
in
quantity
was
hopelessly
less
also
it
had
a
defensive
policy
it
did
not
dream
of
any
but
a
defensive
war
and
no
war
was
ever
won
by
mere
defense
there
could
be
no
defense
against
the
of
tensions
the
contriving
of
incidents
the
invention
of
insults
it
had
been
proved
often
enough
eventually
there
was
an
ultimatum
and
there
was
surrender
and
then
the
installation
of
a
puppet
government
and
the
ruthless
bleeding
of
another
captured
planet
for
the
benefit
of
the
rulers
of
mekin
the
process
was
implacable
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
submit
flee
or
die
various
parts
of
kandar
population
chose
one
or
another
course
four
great
liners
would
carry
away
those
who
could
be
helped
to
flee
the
mass
of
the
people
must
submit
the
fighting
forces
savagely
made
ready
to
die
but
in
the
cabinet
meeting
after
the
destruction
of
the
hidden
enemy
cruiser
the
tone
was
set
by
highly
practical
men
bors
was
present
at
the
meeting
he
destroyed
the
cruiser
he
was
to
be
questioned
about
it
he
had
morgan
standing
by
to
explain
the
part
of
talents
incorporated
if
required
king
humphrey
said
heavily
this
is
probably
the
last
cabinet
meeting
before
the
coming
of
the
mekinese
i
do
not
think
oratory
is
called
for
i
put
the
situation
as
it
stands
a
fleet
will
come
from
mekin
for
our
answer
to
their
ultimatum
our
will
not
surrender
our
air
force
is
openly
mutinous
at
the
idea
of
submission
it
has
been
said
that
if
we
fight
our
planet
will
be
bombed
from
space
until
all
its
air
is
poison
so
that
every
living
creature
here
will
die
if
this
is
true
i
do
not
think
that
even
we
who
plan
to
fight
have
the
right
to
bring
such
a
bombing
about
but
i
doubt
if
that
is
true
there
has
been
one
incident
whether
one
likes
it
or
not
it
has
happened
captain
bors
has
reason
to
hope
that
the
by
fighting
to
the
death
can
actually
benefit
the
rest
of
our
people
bors
spoke
excitement
coloring
his
words
it
perfectly
simple
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
people
slaves
and
free
men
slaves
can
be
tortured
and
killed
without
concern
with
free
men
a
bargain
has
always
to
be
struck
if
there
is
no
resistance
to
the
mekinese
they
will
despise
us
we
will
be
worse
off
than
if
we
fight
because
if
we
fight
at
least
our
people
will
be
respected
they
may
be
oppressed
because
they
are
conquered
but
they
wo
be
treated
with
the
contempt
and
doubled
oppression
given
to
slaves
a
bearded
man
said
querulously
that
theory
it
psychology
it
even
smacks
of
idealism
let
us
be
realistic
as
a
practical
man
i
am
concerned
with
getting
the
best
possible
terms
for
our
population
after
all
the
dictator
of
mekin
must
be
a
reasonable
man
he
must
be
a
practical
man
i
believe
that
we
should
negotiate
until
the
very
last
instant
bors
said
indignantly
negotiate
you
have
anything
to
negotiate
with
i
am
not
a
citizen
of
kandar
though
i
serve
in
its
fleet
i
am
still
a
national
of
tralee
but
i
have
talked
to
the
officers
of
the
fleet
they
wo
surrender
you
ca
negotiate
for
them
to
do
so
you
ca
negotiate
for
them
to
go
quietly
away
and
pretend
that
nothing
has
happened
and
that
there
never
was
a
fleet
when
the
mekinese
arrive
the
fleet
will
fight
it
does
hope
to
win
it
does
expect
anything
except
getting
killed
honorably
when
its
enemy
would
like
to
have
it
grovel
but
it
going
to
fight
king
humphrey
said
doggedly
my
influence
does
not
extend
to
the
disgrace
of
our
fighting
forces
the
fleet
will
fight
i
believe
it
unwise
but
since
it
will
fight
i
shall
be
in
the
flagship
and
it
not
there
was
a
pause
the
bearded
man
said
peevishly
but
it
should
fight
on
its
own
it
should
not
compromise
kandar
there
was
a
murmur
king
humphrey
looked
about
him
from
under
lowered
brows
that
can
be
arranged
he
said
heavily
i
will
constitute
a
caretaker
government
by
royal
proclamation
i
will
appoint
you
he
looked
steadily
at
the
bearded
man
to
be
head
of
it
and
make
such
terms
as
you
can
if
you
like
when
the
mekinese
come
you
can
warn
them
that
the
fleet
has
mutinied
under
me
its
king
and
may
offer
battle
but
that
you
are
ready
to
lead
the
people
of
kandar
in
in
licking
the
boots
of
all
mekinese
said
bors
in
an
icy
tone
there
was
a
small
rumble
of
protest
bors
stood
up
i
better
leave
he
said
coldly
i
not
entitled
to
speak
if
you
want
me
i
can
be
reached
he
strode
from
the
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
he
ground
his
teeth
the
stout
man
morgan
of
the
paced
up
and
down
the
room
where
he
waited
to
be
called
his
daughter
sat
tranquilly
in
a
chair
she
smiled
pleasantly
at
bors
when
he
came
in
morgan
turned
to
face
him
here
some
talents
incorporated
information
he
said
zestfully
the
cabinet
is
scared
a
few
are
willing
to
fight
but
most
are
already
trying
to
think
how
they
can
make
terms
with
the
mekinese
bors
opened
his
mouth
to
swear
then
checked
himself
gwenlyn
said
morgan
will
pardon
an
expression
of
honest
indignation
it
a
dirty
shame
eh
if
i
were
a
native
of
kandar
said
bors
bitterly
i
be
even
more
ashamed
than
i
am
as
a
native
of
tralee
the
people
of
tralee
surrendered
but
they
did
realize
what
they
were
getting
into
these
men
do
the
girl
gwenlyn
said
quietly
i
sorry
for
king
humphrey
he
miscast
said
morgan
briskly
he
should
be
king
of
a
calm
and
peaceful
world
in
calm
and
peaceful
times
you
going
to
have
trouble
with
him
captain
bors
then
he
said
perhaps
we
can
work
out
a
plan
or
two
eh
while
you
waiting
for
the
cabinet
to
call
you
back
i
no
authority
said
bors
my
uncle
the
pretender
of
tralee
and
i
was
originally
commissioned
in
the
fleet
as
a
sort
of
courtesy
to
him
i
ca
speak
for
anybody
but
myself
you
can
speak
for
common
sense
said
gwenlyn
after
all
you
know
what
the
people
really
want
you
could
try
to
arrange
things
so
that
the
fleet
can
fight
well
it
fight
well
said
bors
curtly
it
give
a
good
account
of
itself
but
that
wo
do
any
good
morgan
struck
an
attitude
beaming
ah
but
you
got
talents
incorporated
on
your
side
you
realize
yet
captain
what
a
difference
that
can
make
while
life
and
talents
incorporated
there
hope
bors
shrugged
suddenly
he
found
that
he
too
drearily
accepted
defeat
there
was
no
more
hope
of
accomplishment
there
was
nothing
to
be
achieved
he
would
serve
no
purpose
by
straining
against
the
impossible
he
said
tiredly
i
agree
that
talents
incorporated
cost
the
mekinese
one
cruiser
a
trifle
said
morgan
waving
his
hand
mere
soupçon
of
accomplishment
we
prepared
to
do
vastly
more
it
occurred
to
bors
to
be
curious
why
you
risking
your
life
and
your
daughter
by
staying
here
if
mekin
ever
finds
out
about
its
cruiser
on
the
sea
bottom
and
your
share
in
that
affair
you
be
in
a
fix
and
certainly
you
ca
expect
to
make
a
profit
here
we
could
even
pay
you
for
what
you
already
done
i
right
now
said
morgan
placidly
quite
as
rich
as
i
want
to
be
i
another
ambition
but
let
not
go
into
that
i
want
to
show
you
what
talents
incorporated
can
do
in
the
four
days
he
looked
at
his
watch
three
hours
and
some
odd
minutes
that
remain
before
the
mekinese
fleet
turns
up
you
checked
up
on
talents
incorporated
my
uncle
says
bors
told
him
that
you
kept
phillip
of
norden
from
being
assassinated
by
a
at
a
cornerstone
laying
he
also
says
you
would
accept
a
reward
only
a
medal
i
collect
them
said
morgan
modestly
you
be
surprised
how
many
orders
and
decorations
a
man
can
acquire
by
industry
and
organization
and
talents
incorporated
gwenlyn
said
four
days
three
hours
and
some
odd
minutes
true
said
morgan
let
get
at
it
captain
bors
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
lightning
calculator
a
person
who
can
do
complicated
sums
in
his
head
as
fast
as
he
can
hear
or
read
the
numbers
involved
yes
said
bors
it
quite
phenomenal
i
believe
it
a
form
of
genius
said
morgan
only
i
call
it
a
talent
because
it
tends
to
make
itself
useless
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
dowser
if
you
mean
a
man
who
finds
places
for
wells
and
locates
mines
by
means
of
a
hazel
twig
the
hazel
twig
is
immaterial
morgan
told
him
the
point
is
that
you
heard
of
them
and
you
know
that
they
can
actually
do
such
things
right
bors
frowned
it
not
proven
he
said
at
least
i
think
it
considered
proven
because
it
is
understood
but
i
believe
conceded
that
such
things
are
done
i
believe
in
fact
that
dowsing
has
been
done
on
photographs
and
maps
in
an
office
and
not
on
the
spot
at
all
i
admit
that
that
seems
impossible
but
i
told
it
happens
morgan
nodded
rapidly
very
well
pleased
one
more
have
you
heard
of
precognition
bors
nodded
then
he
shrugged
i
have
a
talent
said
morgan
i
have
a
man
in
my
employ
with
a
talent
for
precognizing
when
ships
are
going
to
arrive
his
gift
is
strictly
limited
he
used
to
work
in
a
spaceport
office
he
always
knew
when
a
ship
was
coming
in
he
did
know
how
he
knew
he
does
know
now
but
he
always
knows
when
a
ship
will
arrive
at
the
planet
where
he
is
interesting
said
bors
only
half
listening
he
was
discharged
morgan
went
on
because
he
allowed
a
maintenance
crew
to
disassemble
for
repair
a
vital
relay
in
a
on
the
very
day
when
three
were
scheduled
for
arrival
there
was
pandemonium
of
course
because
nothing
could
have
landed
there
so
when
my
talent
let
the
relay
be
dismantled
with
three
ships
expected
but
one
ship
was
one
day
late
another
two
days
and
the
third
four
he
knew
it
he
did
know
how
but
he
knew
he
was
discharged
anyway
bors
did
not
answer
the
cabinet
meeting
in
the
other
room
went
on
he
told
me
said
morgan
that
four
ships
would
arrive
on
kandar
and
when
one
of
them
has
arrived
the
others
will
come
as
predicted
he
knows
that
a
fleet
will
get
here
two
days
after
the
last
of
the
four
one
can
guess
it
will
be
the
mekinese
fleet
bors
frowned
he
was
interested
now
i
another
talent
pursued
morgan
he
ought
to
be
a
paranoiac
he
has
all
the
tendencies
to
suspicion
that
a
paranoid
personality
has
but
his
suspicions
happen
to
be
true
he
read
an
item
in
a
newspaper
or
walk
past
oh
say
a
bank
darkly
and
suspiciously
he
guesses
that
the
newspaper
item
will
suggest
a
crime
to
someone
or
that
someone
will
attempt
to
rob
the
bank
in
this
fashion
or
that
at
a
time
and
someone
does
he
be
an
uncomfortable
companion
bors
observed
wryly
i
found
him
in
jail
said
morgan
cheerfully
he
been
warning
the
police
of
crimes
to
come
they
happened
so
the
police
jailed
him
and
demanded
that
he
name
his
accomplices
so
they
could
break
up
the
criminal
gang
whose
feats
he
knew
in
advance
i
got
him
out
of
jail
and
hired
him
as
a
talent
in
talents
incorporated
bors
blinked
before
we
landed
here
said
morgan
i
told
him
about
the
political
situation
the
events
you
expect
he
immediately
suspected
that
the
mekinese
would
have
a
ship
down
somewhere
to
blast
the
fleet
of
kandar
if
it
should
dare
to
resist
in
fact
he
said
positively
that
such
a
cruiser
was
waiting
word
to
fire
bors
blinked
again
and
i
spread
out
maps
said
morgan
and
my
dowser
went
over
them
not
with
a
hazel
twig
but
something
equally
unscientific
his
instinct
and
he
assured
me
that
the
cruiser
was
under
water
five
miles
magnetic
from
cape
farnell
the
map
said
the
depth
there
was
fifty
fathoms
then
my
paranoid
talent
observed
that
be
spies
on
shore
with
means
to
signal
to
the
submerged
cruiser
my
dowser
then
found
a
small
shack
on
the
map
where
a
communicator
to
the
ship
would
be
with
the
information
about
the
arrival
of
the
liners
and
the
facts
about
the
cruiser
and
i
had
other
information
too
i
went
to
the
ministry
for
diplomatic
affairs
and
told
you
as
you
know
the
information
i
gave
you
was
accurate
bors
felt
as
if
he
been
hit
over
the
head
this
was
ridiculous
hunted
for
the
under
the
sea
because
the
prediction
of
the
liner
arrival
was
so
uncannily
correct
he
helped
plan
and
carry
out
the
destruction
of
that
warship
because
its
existence
and
location
were
verified
by
a
magnetometer
but
if
he
known
how
the
information
was
obtained
if
he
known
it
was
guessed
at
by
a
discharged
spaceport
employee
and
a
paranoid
personality
and
a
man
who
used
a
hazel
twig
or
something
similar
if
he
known
that
he
never
have
dreamed
of
accepting
it
he
have
flatly
dismissed
the
prediction
but
if
he
had
trusted
the
information
enough
to
check
on
it
why
the
small
of
kandar
would
vanish
in
atomic
flame
when
it
tried
to
take
off
to
fight
with
it
would
vanish
bors
and
his
uncle
and
the
king
and
many
resolute
haters
of
mekin
gwenlyn
said
you
perfectly
right
captain
what
that
asked
bors
numbly
it
is
lunacy
said
gwenlyn
pleasantly
just
like
it
would
have
seemed
lunacy
once
upon
a
time
to
think
of
people
talking
to
each
other
when
they
were
a
thousand
miles
apart
like
it
seemed
insane
to
talk
about
flying
machines
and
again
when
they
said
there
could
be
a
in
which
the
reaction
would
be
at
a
right
angle
to
the
action
and
especially
when
somebody
said
that
a
way
would
be
found
to
drive
ships
faster
than
light
it
lunacy
just
like
those
things
agreed
bors
his
thoughts
crowding
one
another
it
all
of
that
morgan
nodded
his
head
rapidly
i
felt
that
way
about
it
he
observed
when
i
first
got
the
idea
of
finding
and
organizing
talents
for
practical
purposes
but
i
said
to
myself
of
great
fortunes
have
been
made
by
people
assuming
that
other
people
are
idiots
in
some
ways
they
are
you
know
and
then
i
said
to
myself
a
fortune
can
be
made
by
somebody
assuming
that
is
an
idiot
so
i
assumed
it
was
idiotic
to
doubt
something
that
visibly
happened
merely
because
i
could
understand
it
and
talents
incorporated
was
born
it
done
quite
well
bors
shook
his
head
as
if
to
clear
it
it
seems
to
have
worked
he
admitted
but
if
i
known
he
spread
out
his
hands
i
play
along
what
more
can
you
do
for
us
i
no
idea
said
morgan
placidly
such
things
have
to
work
themselves
out
with
a
little
prodding
of
course
but
one
of
my
talents
says
the
talent
is
the
one
who
do
you
the
most
good
soonest
i
suggest
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
from
the
cabinet
room
the
door
opened
and
king
humphrey
came
out
he
looked
baffled
which
was
not
unusual
but
he
looked
enraged
which
was
bors
he
said
thickly
i
always
thought
i
was
a
practical
man
but
if
being
practical
means
what
some
members
of
my
cabinet
think
i
would
rather
be
a
poet
bors
do
something
before
my
cabinet
dethrones
me
and
tricks
the
fleet
into
disbanding
he
stumbled
across
the
room
not
noticing
morgan
or
gwenlyn
bors
came
to
attention
majesty
he
said
not
knowing
whether
he
spoke
in
irony
or
bewilderment
i
take
that
as
an
order
the
king
did
not
answer
when
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
closed
behind
his
unregal
figure
bors
turned
to
morgan
i
think
i
been
given
authority
he
said
in
a
sort
of
baffled
calm
suppose
we
go
morgan
and
find
out
what
your
lightning
calculator
can
do
in
the
way
of
mental
arithmetic
to
change
the
situation
of
the
kingdom
fine
said
morgan
cheerfully
know
captain
bors
he
can
solve
a
problem
in
his
head
he
has
the
least
idea
how
he
does
it
but
the
answer
always
comes
out
right
then
he
said
exuberantly
he
tell
you
something
useful
though
that
talents
incorporated
information
chapter
there
was
a
fleet
on
the
way
to
kandar
it
could
not
be
said
to
be
traveling
in
space
of
course
if
there
had
been
an
observer
somewhere
he
could
not
conceivably
have
detected
the
ships
there
would
be
no
occultations
of
stars
no
blotting
out
of
any
of
the
hundreds
and
thousands
of
millions
of
bright
specks
which
filled
all
the
firmament
there
would
be
no
which
even
the
most
sensitive
of
instruments
could
pick
up
the
fleet
might
be
at
one
place
to
an
observer
right
where
it
was
imperceptible
and
then
it
might
be
at
a
place
to
the
observer
left
where
it
was
undetectable
and
nobody
could
have
told
the
difference
actually
each
ship
of
the
mekinese
fleet
was
in
overdrive
which
meant
that
each
had
stressed
the
space
immediately
around
it
so
that
it
was
like
a
cocoon
of
as
if
it
were
out
of
this
cosmos
altogether
and
in
another
in
sober
fact
of
course
nothing
of
the
sort
had
happened
an
overdrive
field
changed
the
physical
constants
of
space
the
capacity
of
a
condenser
in
an
overdrive
field
was
different
from
that
of
a
condenser
out
of
it
the
of
a
coil
in
an
overdrive
field
was
not
the
same
as
in
normal
space
magnetic
and
gravitational
fields
also
did
not
follow
the
same
laws
in
stressed
space
as
in
unstressed
extension
the
speed
of
light
was
different
inertia
was
different
in
short
a
ship
could
drive
at
many
hundreds
of
times
the
velocity
of
light
and
the
laws
of
einstein
did
not
apply
because
his
laws
referred
to
space
that
men
had
not
tampered
with
but
though
ships
in
overdrive
had
to
be
considered
as
in
motion
and
though
their
speed
had
to
be
considered
as
beyond
the
astronomical
there
were
such
incredible
distances
to
be
covered
that
time
piled
up
aside
from
double
stars
there
were
no
suns
yet
discovered
which
were
less
than
apart
the
time
required
for
travel
between
inhabited
planets
was
still
comparable
to
the
time
needed
for
between
continents
on
a
world
so
the
fleet
of
mekin
journeying
faster
than
the
mind
could
imagine
nevertheless
drove
and
drove
and
drove
in
the
blackness
and
darkness
and
isolation
of
each
ship
overdrive
field
they
had
so
driven
for
days
they
would
continue
to
do
so
for
days
to
come
when
captain
bors
burned
the
documents
in
the
ministry
for
diplomatic
affairs
the
enemy
fleet
might
have
been
said
to
be
at
one
place
when
a
submerged
planning
assassination
was
itself
blown
to
bits
with
no
chance
to
strike
back
the
mekinese
fleet
was
approximately
somewhere
else
when
a
cabinet
meeting
disheartened
king
humphrey
the
fleet
was
much
nearer
to
kandar
but
days
of
eventlessness
were
still
ahead
of
the
so
bors
and
gwenlyn
and
morgan
got
a
and
were
driven
to
kandar
commercial
spaceport
there
they
found
the
it
was
far
larger
than
the
usual
there
were
commercial
which
were
no
larger
but
it
was
a
workmanlike
sort
of
ship
at
that
it
had
two
lifeboat
blisters
and
there
were
emergency
rockets
for
landings
where
no
existed
the
armored
bands
of
shielding
were
massive
the
in
fact
looked
more
like
a
service
ship
than
either
a
commercial
vessel
or
a
yacht
it
was
obviously
unarmed
but
it
had
the
look
of
a
craft
that
could
go
very
nearly
anywhere
you
find
the
talents
a
bit
odd
said
gwenlyn
as
they
drove
up
under
the
hull
wide
bulge
when
they
meet
new
people
they
like
to
show
off
most
of
them
were
pretty
well
frustrated
before
father
found
a
use
for
them
but
they
quite
pleasant
people
if
you
do
treat
them
like
freaks
they
not
you
know
bors
had
nothing
to
say
until
he
was
fifteen
he
lived
on
tralee
which
was
then
a
quiet
pacific
world
as
kandar
had
been
as
the
nephew
of
a
monarch
at
least
as
resolutely
constitutional
as
king
humphrey
he
been
raised
in
a
very
fashion
the
atmosphere
had
been
that
of
a
comfortable
realistic
adjustment
to
facts
he
was
taught
a
great
respect
for
certain
facts
without
being
made
fanatically
opposed
to
anything
else
he
been
trained
to
require
reasonable
evidence
without
demanding
that
all
proofs
come
out
of
test
tubes
and
electronic
apparatus
he
was
specifically
taught
that
arithmetic
can
not
be
proved
by
experimental
evidence
but
that
sound
experimental
evidence
agrees
with
arithmetic
so
he
was
probably
better
qualified
than
most
to
deal
with
something
like
talents
incorporated
but
it
was
not
easy
for
him
the
stopped
an
in
the
space
yacht
opened
and
an
came
down
the
three
of
them
mounted
it
the
inner
opened
and
they
entered
the
an
incredibly
fat
woman
regarded
bors
with
warm
and
sentimental
eyes
a
man
no
older
than
bors
but
with
prematurely
gray
hair
nodded
at
him
a
man
in
a
chair
lifted
a
hand
in
highly
dignified
greeting
everyone
seemed
to
know
who
he
was
there
was
a
blonde
woman
who
might
be
in
her
late
thirties
a
short
scowling
man
with
several
jewelled
rings
on
his
fingers
and
a
gangling
skinny
adolescent
there
were
still
others
morgan
addressed
them
with
enthusiasm
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
i
present
captain
bors
he
come
to
arrange
to
use
your
talents
in
the
gravest
of
all
possible
situations
for
his
world
there
were
nods
there
were
bows
the
dignified
man
in
the
chair
said
confidently
the
ship
was
where
i
specified
exactly
said
morgan
beaming
exactly
a
magnificent
piece
of
work
which
is
what
i
expected
of
you
he
made
individual
introductions
all
around
bors
did
not
begin
to
catch
the
names
this
was
said
morgan
our
telepath
still
another
our
precognizer
he
predicted
the
coming
of
the
liner
you
remember
he
came
to
the
scowling
man
with
rings
captain
bors
this
is
our
talent
for
predicting
dirty
tricks
you
reason
to
thank
him
for
disclosing
that
mekinese
cruiser
underwater
bors
followed
the
lead
given
him
there
are
many
of
us
he
said
with
reason
to
thank
you
for
a
most
satisfying
operation
we
smashed
that
cruiser
the
scowling
man
nodded
portentously
the
introductions
went
on
the
skinny
adolescent
was
our
talent
for
locating
individuals
the
enormously
fat
woman
our
talent
for
propaganda
bors
was
confused
he
had
to
steel
himself
not
to
decide
flatly
that
all
this
was
nonsense
morgan
and
gwenlyn
took
him
away
from
what
appeared
like
a
sort
of
social
hall
for
these
externally
commonplace
persons
they
arrived
at
a
smaller
compartment
it
was
a
much
more
personal
sort
of
place
morgan
waved
his
hand
gwenlyn
and
i
live
here
he
observed
our
cabins
are
yonder
and
you
might
call
this
our
family
room
gwenlyn
finds
the
undiluted
society
of
talents
a
bit
wearing
of
course
handling
them
is
my
profession
though
i
have
some
plans
for
retirement
we
see
our
mathematics
talent
in
a
minute
or
two
he
knows
it
expected
that
he
be
the
most
useful
of
all
our
talents
at
the
moment
he
will
make
an
entrance
gwenlyn
sat
down
she
regarded
bors
with
amusement
i
think
the
captain
halfway
unconvinced
again
father
i
not
unconvinced
said
bors
grimly
i
desperate
it
not
easy
either
to
ignore
what
happened
or
to
believe
that
it
will
continue
and
i
well
if
the
mekinese
fleet
does
arrive
i
do
want
to
miss
going
with
our
fleet
to
meet
it
you
wo
miss
anything
captain
said
morgan
happily
have
a
cigar
gwenlyn
do
you
think
i
should
let
me
said
gwenlyn
i
know
how
the
captain
feels
i
an
outsider
too
i
have
any
talent
fortunately
sit
down
captain
bors
seated
himself
morgan
offered
a
cigar
he
seemed
too
impatient
and
much
too
pleased
to
be
able
to
sit
down
himself
bors
lighted
the
cigar
at
the
first
puff
he
removed
it
and
looked
at
it
respectfully
such
cigars
were
not
easy
to
come
by
i
think
said
gwenlyn
amiably
that
father
himself
has
a
talent
which
makes
him
not
too
easy
to
get
along
with
but
it
has
had
some
good
results
i
hope
it
will
have
more
here
the
whole
business
is
unbelievable
though
unless
you
think
of
some
very
special
facts
bors
nodded
he
puffed
again
and
waited
he
told
you
some
of
it
said
gwenlyn
about
the
ship
arrival
talent
and
the
dowser
there
always
been
such
people
with
gifts
that
nobody
ever
understood
but
that
are
real
only
they
always
been
considered
freaks
they
feel
that
they
remarkable
and
they
are
and
they
want
people
to
recognize
this
but
they
never
had
a
function
in
society
they
been
all
function
take
the
mathematical
talent
he
can
do
any
sort
of
mathematics
in
his
head
any
sort
he
used
to
hire
out
to
work
computers
and
he
always
got
discharged
because
he
did
the
computations
in
his
head
instead
of
using
the
machines
he
was
always
right
and
he
was
proud
of
his
ability
he
wanted
to
use
it
but
nobody
let
him
he
was
a
miserable
misfit
until
father
found
him
and
hired
him
bors
nodded
again
but
his
forehead
wrinkled
talents
incorporated
is
merely
an
organization
created
by
my
father
to
make
use
of
people
who
can
do
things
ordinarily
impossible
and
probably
unexplainable
but
which
exist
nevertheless
there
are
more
talents
than
father
has
gathered
of
course
but
what
good
are
their
gifts
to
them
no
good
at
all
they
considered
freaks
so
father
gathered
them
together
as
he
found
them
first
of
course
he
needed
capital
so
he
used
them
to
make
money
then
he
began
to
do
useful
things
with
them
since
nobody
else
did
now
he
brought
them
here
to
help
bors
said
painfully
they
do
all
have
the
same
gift
no
agreed
gwenlyn
and
there
are
limits
to
their
talents
naturally
morgan
broke
in
amused
gwenlyn
insists
that
i
have
the
talent
of
finding
and
using
talents
a
mild
talent
father
said
gwenlyn
not
enough
to
make
you
revolting
but
a
door
opened
a
tweedy
man
with
a
small
mustache
stood
in
the
doorway
i
believe
i
wanted
he
said
offhandedly
morgan
introduced
him
his
name
was
logan
he
was
the
lightning
calculator
the
mathematical
talent
of
talents
incorporated
bors
shook
his
hand
the
tweedy
man
sat
down
he
drew
out
a
pipe
and
began
to
fill
it
with
conscious
exactitude
he
looked
remarkably
like
a
professor
of
mathematics
who
modestly
pretended
to
be
just
another
commuter
he
dressed
the
part
slightly
untidy
hair
bulldog
pipe
casual
expensive
sports
shoes
i
understand
he
said
negligently
that
you
want
some
calculations
made
i
told
i
do
said
bors
harassedly
but
i
do
know
what
they
are
then
how
can
i
make
them
asked
logan
with
lifted
eyebrows
naturally
said
morgan
you
find
out
the
kind
of
calculations
he
needs
that
he
ca
get
anywhere
else
that
be
the
kind
he
needs
from
you
hm
said
logan
he
blew
a
thoughtfully
where
do
you
use
calculations
in
everywhere
said
bors
but
we
computers
for
it
and
they
quite
adequate
logan
shrugged
then
what
do
you
need
me
for
you
tell
me
said
bors
nettled
certainly
we
do
need
calculations
for
we
no
long
journey
in
mind
we
simply
going
to
go
out
and
do
some
fighting
when
the
mekinese
fleet
gets
here
logan
blew
another
what
calculations
do
you
use
in
courses
and
distances
said
bors
he
could
see
no
sense
in
this
but
he
went
on
allowing
for
acceleration
and
deceleration
in
setting
our
missiles
on
targets
allowing
for
the
motion
of
the
targets
again
we
have
computers
for
this
in
practice
they
too
good
if
we
send
a
missile
at
a
mekinese
ship
they
set
a
computer
on
it
and
it
computes
a
course
for
a
which
explodes
and
destroys
our
missile
when
it
within
a
certain
distance
of
it
then
your
missile
does
hit
said
logan
all
too
often
it
does
admitted
bors
then
their
missiles
do
hit
either
if
they
send
a
hundred
missiles
at
us
they
cancelled
out
if
we
send
a
hundred
to
destroy
them
unfortunately
if
they
send
more
than
we
can
counter
we
get
wiped
out
bors
found
his
throat
going
dry
this
of
course
was
what
desperately
been
denying
to
himself
it
was
the
fundamental
reason
for
a
total
lack
of
hope
the
history
of
warfare
is
the
history
of
rivalry
between
attack
and
defense
in
the
matter
of
missiles
in
space
there
was
a
stalemate
one
missile
fired
in
attack
could
always
be
destroyed
by
another
fired
in
defense
it
was
an
arithmetic
balance
but
it
meant
that
three
ships
could
always
destroy
two
and
four
ships
three
in
the
ahead
there
would
be
at
least
ten
mekinese
ships
to
every
one
from
kandar
the
sally
of
kandar
fleet
would
not
be
a
rush
into
battle
but
an
advance
into
annihilation
what
we
need
said
bors
desperately
is
a
means
to
compute
courses
for
our
missiles
so
hit
and
that
the
enemy
ca
so
that
his
missiles
ca
compute
how
to
change
course
in
order
to
cancel
ours
out
he
was
astonished
as
the
words
left
his
mouth
this
was
what
was
needed
of
course
but
then
he
realized
that
it
could
be
done
logan
blew
a
mechanical
computers
he
said
have
limits
they
designed
to
calculate
a
trajectory
with
constant
acceleration
or
no
acceleration
but
that
all
bors
frowned
what
else
could
there
be
changing
acceleration
said
logan
condescendingly
a
mechanical
computer
ca
compute
that
but
i
can
bors
continued
to
frown
one
part
of
his
mind
assured
him
that
the
statement
that
mechanical
computers
could
not
calculate
trajectories
of
missiles
with
changing
acceleration
was
incorrect
but
the
rest
of
his
mind
tried
to
imagine
such
a
trajectory
he
could
in
practice
men
do
not
have
to
handle
the
results
of
variable
acceleration
as
cumulative
effects
i
think
said
bors
carefully
that
if
you
can
do
that
logan
blew
a
more
perfect
than
any
that
had
gone
before
i
calculate
some
tables
he
said
modestly
you
can
use
them
on
your
then
if
you
arrange
your
missiles
to
change
their
acceleration
as
they
go
the
mekinese
missiles
ca
intercept
them
he
waved
his
hand
with
the
grand
air
of
someone
assuring
a
pupil
that
multiplication
tables
were
quite
reliable
and
could
be
used
with
confidence
but
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
bors
face
as
the
captain
realized
the
implications
of
his
statement
the
eyes
of
the
mathematical
talent
of
talents
incorporated
shone
with
gratified
vanity
we
go
out
in
a
couple
of
tin
cans
said
bors
fiercely
and
try
this
out
with
dummy
warheads
gwenlyn
said
quickly
marvelous
marvelous
logan
it
nothing
said
logan
modestly
but
it
was
a
very
great
deal
bors
impatient
to
try
it
out
nevertheless
realized
that
logan
had
made
the
suggestion
out
of
a
brilliant
perception
of
a
solution
to
a
problem
in
ballistics
but
because
he
thought
in
terms
of
mathematical
processes
he
did
think
of
a
new
missile
operation
but
a
new
kind
of
computation
and
he
reveled
in
the
fact
that
he
had
showed
off
his
brilliance
in
the
on
the
way
to
the
fleet
bors
said
helplessly
to
gwenlyn
i
not
the
right
man
to
be
the
liaison
with
you
people
but
this
might
make
us
a
pretty
costly
conquest
for
mekin
with
luck
we
may
trade
them
ship
for
ship
they
wo
miss
the
ships
they
lose
but
it
be
a
lot
of
satisfaction
to
us
you
expect
to
be
killed
gwenlyn
said
flatly
my
uncle
explained
bors
considers
that
he
should
have
gotten
killed
when
mekin
took
over
tralee
it
would
have
set
a
good
example
since
we
did
do
it
for
tralee
we
do
it
for
kandar
the
king
going
along
too
after
all
that
one
of
the
things
kings
are
for
to
get
killed
when
necessary
bors
told
her
kandar
should
surrender
even
though
there
will
be
at
least
ten
mekinese
to
one
kandarian
she
smiled
at
him
very
oddly
i
suspect
she
said
that
not
everybody
on
the
fleet
will
be
killed
i
sure
of
it
in
fact
as
my
father
would
say
that
talents
incorporated
information
bors
frowned
worriedly
the
fleet
of
mekin
continued
in
overdrive
heading
for
kandar
each
second
it
traversed
a
distance
equal
to
the
span
of
a
solar
system
out
to
its
remotest
planet
a
heartbeat
that
would
begin
where
a
pulsing
cepheid
had
it
been
possible
to
see
would
have
seemed
at
its
greatest
brilliance
and
would
end
where
the
light
from
that
same
giant
star
seemed
dimmed
almost
to
extinction
of
course
no
such
observation
could
be
made
from
any
ship
in
overdrive
each
one
of
the
many
many
ugly
was
sealed
in
its
own
cocoon
of
space
even
in
the
armed
transports
that
carried
officials
and
bureaucrats
and
experienced
police
organizers
to
set
up
a
puppet
government
on
kandar
there
was
not
the
faintest
hint
of
anything
that
happened
outside
the
individual
ship
but
what
might
be
termed
the
position
of
the
fleet
changed
with
remarkable
swiftness
it
traveled
between
breaths
between
sentences
and
but
it
would
not
arrive
on
kandar
for
a
long
while
yet
not
for
three
whole
days
chapter
the
small
fighting
ship
lifted
swiftly
from
the
surface
of
kandar
as
it
rose
the
sky
turned
dark
and
the
sun
brilliant
disk
far
too
bright
to
be
looked
at
with
unshielded
eyes
became
a
blazing
furnace
that
could
roast
unshielded
flesh
stars
appeared
shining
myriads
despite
the
sun
with
every
one
vivid
against
a
background
of
black
the
planet
surface
became
a
of
which
a
part
lay
in
darkness
said
a
voice
through
many
speakers
placed
throughout
the
fighting
ship
hull
there
was
the
rushing
sound
of
compartment
doors
closing
then
a
cushioned
silence
everywhere
save
for
the
faint
standby
scratching
sounds
that
loudspeakers
always
emit
screens
lighted
a
speck
moved
among
the
stars
said
the
voice
and
track
fire
only
as
missiles
the
moving
speck
flamed
and
was
again
only
a
moving
speck
it
ejected
something
which
hurtled
toward
the
ship
just
up
from
kandar
one
away
said
a
confident
voice
the
missile
fled
toward
the
first
moving
speck
diminishing
as
it
went
it
swung
suddenly
off
course
two
snapped
somebody
somewhere
another
object
hurtled
away
toward
the
stars
three
fire
four
far
away
something
came
plunging
toward
the
ship
it
did
not
travel
in
a
straight
line
it
curved
it
was
not
reasonable
for
a
missile
to
travel
in
a
curved
line
the
interceptor
missiles
had
to
detect
it
swing
to
intercept
to
accelerate
furiously
the
first
interceptor
missed
worse
it
had
lost
its
target
it
went
wandering
vaguely
among
the
stars
and
was
gone
the
second
missed
the
voice
in
the
speaker
seemed
to
crack
all
missiles
they
turning
too
late
pull
up
ahead
of
the
damned
thing
the
deadly
contrivances
plunged
away
and
further
away
into
emptiness
the
third
interceptor
missed
the
fourth
tiny
specks
moved
gracefully
on
the
radar
screen
there
was
something
coming
toward
the
ship
that
had
risen
from
kandar
the
of
missiles
appeared
against
the
stars
they
made
very
pretty
parabolas
that
was
all
the
thing
that
was
coming
left
a
too
it
curved
preposterously
the
ship
furiously
flung
missiles
at
it
it
did
not
dodge
but
none
of
the
intersected
its
own
all
of
them
passed
to
its
rear
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
it
was
visible
as
an
object
instead
of
a
speck
that
object
swelled
it
went
by
bors
voice
relayed
said
you
out
of
action
right
the
skipper
of
the
ship
just
up
from
kandar
said
grudgingly
hell
yes
we
threw
fifteen
missiles
at
it
and
missed
with
every
one
this
is
magic
can
we
all
have
this
before
the
mekinese
get
here
hope
said
bors
voice
trying
hard
anyhow
will
you
report
to
ground
said
the
speakers
in
the
ship
which
had
just
fired
fifteen
missiles
without
a
hit
or
interception
and
then
the
compartment
doors
opened
again
and
the
normal
sounds
of
a
small
fighting
ship
in
space
began
again
an
hour
later
aground
bors
said
impatiently
half
a
dozen
ships
have
checked
out
with
me
i
sent
a
single
missile
at
each
one
they
knew
i
was
trying
something
new
they
tried
interceptors
not
one
worked
worse
my
missiles
drew
the
interceptors
so
they
lost
their
original
aim
on
the
missiles
set
for
variable
acceleration
not
only
ca
be
intercepted
but
they
draw
interceptors
and
are
themselves
i
fired
one
dummy
warhead
at
each
i
got
six
hits
with
six
missiles
they
fired
an
average
of
twelve
missiles
against
each
of
mine
they
got
no
intercepts
or
hits
with
tries
this
appears
to
me
a
very
gratifying
development
for
the
situation
we
in
the
bearded
man
who
plumped
for
negotiation
earlier
now
spoke
indignantly
in
the
war
council
why
was
this
revealed
earlier
we
could
have
made
a
demonstration
and
mekin
would
have
been
wary
of
issuing
an
ultimatum
why
was
this
concealed
until
it
was
too
late
to
use
in
negotiations
with
them
it
was
available
until
today
bors
answered
it
was
tried
and
it
worked
an
admiral
said
slowly
as
i
understand
it
this
is
a
proposal
of
the
hm
talents
incorporated
people
no
said
bors
we
got
the
idea
but
could
do
the
math
talents
incorporated
did
the
computations
to
make
the
missiles
hit
why
why
let
them
do
the
math
there
may
be
a
counter
to
this
device
perhaps
talents
incorporated
was
sent
to
us
to
get
us
to
adopt
this
freakish
trick
talents
incorporated
said
bors
enabled
us
to
smash
a
submerged
mekinese
cruiser
in
giving
us
the
necessary
information
talents
incorporated
kept
the
mekinese
from
wiping
out
our
talents
incorporated
oh
the
devil
the
admiral
gazed
about
him
this
device
he
said
precisely
is
not
a
tried
and
standard
weapon
on
the
other
hand
the
sally
of
our
fleet
is
not
war
because
of
our
civilian
population
we
can
not
make
war
on
mekin
the
defiance
of
our
fleet
will
be
a
gesture
only
a
splendid
gesture
but
no
more
it
should
be
a
dignified
gesture
it
would
be
most
inappropriate
for
our
fleet
to
take
to
space
ostensibly
to
say
that
it
prefers
death
to
surrender
and
for
it
then
to
unveil
a
new
and
eccentric
device
which
would
say
that
the
fleet
was
foolish
enough
to
hope
that
a
gadget
would
save
it
from
dying
and
kandar
from
conquest
the
fleet
action
should
be
fought
with
scorn
of
odds
it
should
end
its
existence
in
a
manner
worthy
of
its
traditions
bors
exploded
damnit
king
humphrey
held
up
his
hand
and
said
fretfully
as
i
remember
it
admiral
you
have
been
assigned
to
hold
together
the
defense
forces
those
who
either
did
not
insist
on
going
with
the
fleet
or
for
whom
there
was
no
room
who
have
to
be
surrendered
you
talk
of
gestures
but
the
young
men
who
will
go
out
in
the
fleet
are
not
going
there
to
make
gestures
they
simply
and
furiously
hate
mekin
for
what
it
is
about
to
do
they
are
going
out
to
kill
as
many
mekinese
as
they
can
before
they
themselves
are
killed
they
would
call
your
speech
nonsense
and
i
would
agree
with
them
bors
said
respectfully
yes
majesty
it
may
also
be
said
that
copies
of
the
first
talents
incorporated
tables
have
already
been
distributed
to
the
missile
crews
throughout
the
fleet
more
are
being
distributed
as
fast
as
logan
calculates
them
i
do
think
you
can
keep
our
ships
from
trying
the
new
missiles
when
the
fighting
starts
indignantly
the
bearded
man
said
i
protest
this
is
a
war
council
if
the
council
is
to
be
lectured
by
strangers
and
if
its
orders
wo
be
obeyed
why
hold
it
why
indeed
king
humphrey
looked
sternly
about
the
sternness
did
not
become
him
but
dignity
did
he
said
with
dignity
you
who
are
to
stay
here
have
to
think
of
dealing
with
a
victorious
mekin
we
who
are
to
go
have
to
think
of
making
our
defeat
count
there
is
no
point
in
further
discussion
the
fleet
will
take
off
immediately
he
rose
from
his
seat
the
bearded
man
protested
but
the
mekinese
are
here
yet
they
wo
arrive
until
day
after
tomorrow
you
using
talents
incorporated
information
objected
bors
and
it
is
wise
for
the
fleet
to
move
at
once
you
are
reasonable
men
too
reasonable
nothing
can
destroy
a
nation
so
quickly
as
for
it
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
practical
reasonable
men
who
act
upon
the
best
scientific
data
and
the
opinions
of
the
best
experts
that
happened
on
tralee
and
my
uncle
and
myself
are
exiles
and
tralee
is
subjugated
in
consequence
but
i
am
beginning
to
have
hope
for
kandar
he
followed
king
humphrey
out
of
the
fleet
admirals
brought
up
the
rear
the
stodgy
dumpy
figure
of
the
king
tramped
onward
it
became
obvious
that
he
was
bound
for
the
that
waited
to
take
him
and
those
who
would
follow
him
to
the
launching
area
of
the
fleet
a
lean
gray
fell
into
step
beside
bors
you
do
think
things
are
hopeless
captain
he
asked
curiously
i
do
see
the
shred
of
a
chance
for
us
but
my
whole
life
been
in
the
fleet
under
mekin
i
be
drafted
to
work
in
a
factory
or
serve
as
an
on
a
one
or
the
other
i
rather
end
in
a
good
fight
how
can
you
have
hope
bors
said
grimly
i
not
sure
that
i
have
but
i
ca
believe
that
nations
can
be
saved
by
reasonable
practical
men
they
are
made
by
them
i
no
hope
except
that
acting
foolishly
may
be
wisdom
sometimes
it
is
ha
the
grinned
wryly
but
fortunes
are
made
by
businessmen
and
only
history
by
heroes
no
sensible
man
is
ever
a
hero
but
like
you
i
do
like
practical
men
they
went
the
king
climbed
sturdily
into
a
it
hummed
away
there
was
a
sort
of
ordered
confusion
and
then
other
began
to
stream
away
from
the
palace
morgan
appeared
and
waved
to
bors
he
hesitated
and
morgan
pointed
to
an
unofficial
vehicle
inside
gwenlyn
was
smiling
cheerfully
at
bors
he
found
himself
returning
the
smile
and
allowed
himself
to
be
guided
to
her
the
rolled
swiftly
after
the
others
i
a
little
more
talents
incorporated
information
said
morgan
it
written
down
for
you
to
read
when
you
get
to
wherever
going
it
rather
important
please
be
sure
to
read
it
fairly
soon
it
may
affect
the
fight
i
headed
for
the
fleet
said
bors
take
me
there
will
you
i
wanted
to
say
something
before
i
left
anyhow
morgan
waved
his
hand
i
can
guess
he
said
blandly
deepest
gratitude
and
all
that
but
the
rush
of
events
blocked
any
way
to
arrange
a
suitable
recompense
for
what
talents
incorporated
has
done
bors
blinked
that
the
substance
of
what
i
meant
to
say
he
admitted
we
take
it
up
later
morgan
told
him
we
get
in
touch
with
you
after
the
battle
i
doubt
it
said
bors
i
not
likely
to
be
around
gwenlyn
laughed
a
little
what
so
amusing
asked
bors
i
do
mean
to
strike
an
attitude
but
i
do
hate
everything
mekin
stands
for
and
i
a
chance
to
throw
a
brick
at
it
the
price
may
be
high
but
throwing
the
brick
is
necessary
we
said
gwenlyn
have
talents
incorporated
information
some
of
which
is
in
that
letter
father
gave
you
our
department
for
predicting
dirty
tricks
has
been
busy
you
see
but
we
other
information
too
bors
frowned
at
her
he
put
the
letter
away
more
information
and
you
see
me
after
the
fight
you
not
telling
me
you
know
the
future
morgan
waved
a
cigar
of
course
not
that
nonsense
if
one
knew
the
future
one
could
change
it
and
then
it
would
be
what
one
knew
you
have
had
any
prophecies
from
me
prophecy
absurd
all
we
told
you
is
about
events
whose
probability
approaches
unity
but
what
father
means
gwenlyn
told
him
is
that
you
ca
be
told
beforehand
about
anything
you
can
prevent
because
if
you
can
prevent
it
you
can
make
your
knowledge
false
so
it
is
knowledge
what
we
want
to
say
though
is
that
we
are
through
why
not
i
going
to
retire
said
morgan
blandly
but
i
want
to
do
something
first
that
i
can
gloat
over
later
he
wants
added
gwenlyn
to
repose
in
the
satisfaction
of
his
vanity
she
laughed
again
at
her
father
expression
seriously
captain
we
wanted
to
give
you
the
letter
and
to
ask
you
not
to
be
surprised
if
we
turn
up
somewhere
there
a
talent
she
added
a
young
boy
who
can
find
people
he
does
know
how
he
does
it
but
we
find
you
the
turned
in
at
the
fleet
ground
the
normal
interstellar
traffic
of
a
planet
of
course
was
handled
by
a
spaceport
with
ships
brought
down
to
ground
and
lifted
out
to
space
again
by
the
generated
in
a
giant
but
a
could
not
depend
solely
on
ground
installations
the
fighting
ships
of
kandar
were
allowed
to
use
the
planet
spaceport
only
for
special
reasons
emergency
rocket
and
landings
were
necessary
training
for
war
conditions
anyhow
so
the
ground
was
pitted
and
scarred
with
circles
where
no
living
thing
grew
and
where
very
often
the
clay
beneath
the
humus
was
vitrified
by
a
guard
at
the
gate
brought
the
to
a
halt
war
alert
said
bors
only
known
officers
and
men
admitted
here
not
worth
arguing
about
he
got
out
of
the
car
and
shook
hands
i
still
regret
he
told
morgan
that
we
had
no
chance
to
do
something
in
return
for
the
information
you
given
us
to
gwenlyn
he
said
obscurely
i
glad
i
did
know
you
sooner
he
turned
and
walked
briskly
into
the
area
behind
him
morgan
looked
inquisitively
at
his
daughter
what
was
that
he
just
said
he
glad
he
did
know
me
sooner
said
gwenlyn
she
looked
smugly
pleased
considering
everything
it
was
a
very
nice
thing
to
say
i
like
him
even
if
he
does
smile
morgan
did
not
seem
enlightened
it
does
make
sense
to
me
that
because
you
are
my
father
said
gwenlyn
she
stirred
restlessly
she
was
no
longer
smiling
i
hope
talents
incorporated
information
is
wrong
this
time
remember
we
heard
on
norden
that
the
dictator
of
mekin
consults
ah
said
her
father
but
they
only
one
could
be
a
talent
said
gwenlyn
worriedly
maybe
without
even
knowing
it
there
came
a
roaring
sound
something
silvery
and
glistening
rose
swiftly
toward
the
sky
it
dwindled
to
a
speck
there
were
more
roarings
three
more
silvery
glistening
objects
flung
themselves
heavenward
leaving
massive
trails
of
seemingly
solid
smoke
behind
them
then
there
were
bellowings
larger
ships
rose
up
as
the
din
of
their
rising
began
to
diminish
there
were
louder
booming
uproars
and
other
silvery
objects
seemed
to
fling
themselves
toward
the
sky
then
thunder
rolled
and
huge
shapes
plunged
in
their
turn
toward
the
heavens
the
of
kandar
left
its
native
world
it
departed
in
the
formation
used
for
space
maneuvering
much
like
the
tactical
disposition
of
a
column
of
marching
soldiers
in
doubtful
territory
there
was
a
point
in
advance
of
all
the
rest
to
be
the
first
to
detect
or
be
fired
on
by
an
enemy
then
flankers
reached
straight
out
and
to
the
right
and
left
and
then
an
and
then
the
main
force
with
a
behind
it
the
area
became
invisible
under
a
monstrous
roiling
mountain
of
smoke
from
which
threads
of
vapor
reached
to
emptiness
it
became
impossible
to
hear
oneself
talk
it
was
unlikely
that
one
could
have
heard
a
shot
as
the
heavy
ships
took
off
but
presently
there
were
only
lesser
clamors
and
then
mere
roarings
after
them
and
the
last
of
the
died
away
the
smoke
remained
rolling
very
slowly
aside
then
there
were
unexpected
detonations
as
the
mist
dissolved
the
detonations
were
explained
every
building
in
the
home
area
the
sunken
the
giant
rolling
gantries
every
bit
of
ground
equipment
for
the
servicing
of
the
fleet
was
methodically
and
carefully
being
blown
to
bits
the
fleet
was
not
expected
back
the
ships
rose
above
the
atmosphere
and
rose
still
higher
and
the
planet
kandar
became
a
gigantic
ball
which
filled
an
enormous
part
of
the
firmament
then
there
were
cracklings
of
communicators
and
orders
flittered
through
emptiness
in
scrambled
and
broadcasts
of
gibberish
which
came
out
as
lucid
commands
in
the
of
the
ships
then
first
the
point
then
the
advanced
flankers
and
then
the
main
fleet
line
by
line
and
rank
by
rank
every
ship
drove
on
outward
under
drive
the
last
of
the
four
chartered

to
take
refugees
away
before
the
mekinese
arrived

the
disappearance
of
the
ships
in
the
rear
of
the
fleet
formation
the
liner
was
lowered
to
the
ground

to
spend
lavishly
to
get
copies
of
the
news
reports
that
the
liner
had
brought
along
as
a
matter
of
course
he
took
them
back
to
the
where
a
frowning
man
with
rings
on
his
fingers
read
them
with
dark
suspicion
presently
triumphantly
he
dictated
predictions
of
dirty
tricks
from
indications
in
the
news
morgan
returned
to
what
he
called
the
family
room
of
the
yacht
he
relaxed
gwenlyn
tried
to
read
she
did
not
succeed
she
was
excessively
nervous
bors

well
out
from
kandar

made
for
a
rendezvous
over
a
pole
of
the
planet
which
was
the
fourth
planet
from
kandar

it
was
almost
but
not
quite
in
line
with
that
yellow
star
toward
the
base
from
which
the
mekinese
flotilla
would
come
the
fleet
went
into
a
polar
orbit
around
that
gigantic
planet
which
was
useless
to
mankind
because
its
atmosphere
was
partly
gaseous
ammonia
and
partly
methane
the
cosmos
paid
no
attention
an
unstable
star
in
cygnus
collapsed
abruptly
and
a
number
of
otherwise
promising
planets
became
unfit
for
human
exploitation
in
andromeda
a

its
explosion

not

very
many
thousands
of
years
the
largest

reached
perihelion
and
practically
outshone
the

it
circled
nobody
saw
it
because
nobody
lived
there
on
a
dreary
planet
in
mousset
a
thing
squirmed
heavily
out
of
a
stagnant
sea
and
blinked
stupidly
at
the
remarkable
cosmos
it
had
discovered
suns
flamed
and
spouted
flares
small
dark
stars
became
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
a
degree
colder
there
was
a
magnetic
storm
in
the
photosphere
of
a

which
was
not
supposed
to
have
such
things

very
fine
formation

in
its
polar
orbit
around
the
fourth
planet
out
from
kandar

in
carefully
scrambled
and
communications
certain
ships
were
authorized
to
modify

settings
of

missiles
in
this
exact
fashion
to
remove
their
warheads
and
to
diverge
in
pairs
from
the

proper
they
were
to
familiarize
themselves
with
the
results
of
making
the
acceleration
of
such
missiles
variable
during
flight
they
would
use
the
supplied
to
compute
firing
constants
for
given
ranges
and
relative
speeds
they
would
of
course
return
to
formation
to
permit
other
ships
the
same
practice
with
the
new
method
of
missile
handling
bors
read
the
letter
from
talents
incorporated
it
gave
an
exact
time
for
the
breakout
of
the
mekinese
fleet
the
rest
consisted
mostly
of
specific
warnings
from
the
talents
incorporated
department
for
predicting
dirty
tricks
it
listed
certain
things
to
be
looked
for
among
the
ships
of
the
fleet
the
information
was
like
the
news
of
an
enemy
ship
aground
on
kandar
it
was
plausible
once
one
thought
of
it
mekin
was
ruled
and
its
military
practices
governed
by
men
with
the
instincts
of
conspirators
using
other
men
with
the
psychopathological
impulses
which
make
for
spies
they
thought
of
devices
neither
statesmen
nor
fighting
men
would
have
invented
but
a
paranoid
talent
could
think
of
them
and
know
that
they
were
true
as
a
result
of
the
warnings
the
flagship
was
found
to
have
been
somehow
equipped
by
mekin
with
a
tiny
special
microwave
transmitter
which
used
a
frequency
not
usual
on
kandar
it
was
in
effect
a
radio
beacon
on
which
enemy
missiles
could
home
also
the
lead
ship
of
a
had
been
mysteriously
geared
to
reveal
its
exact
position
course
and
speed
while
in
space
there
were
other
concealed
devices
some
would
make
the
controls
of
predetermined
ships
useless
when
beams
of
specific
frequency
and
form
were
trained
upon
them
once
the
basic
idea
was
discovered
it
was
possible
to
make
sure
that
all
such
equipment
was
out
of
operation
the
fleet
was
still
in
no
promising
situation
with
a
disadvantage
but
it
could
not
have
put
up
even
the
beginning
of
a
fight
had
these
devices
remained
undiscovered
bors
said
carefully
by
scrambled
and
communicator
majesty
i
beginning
to
be
less
than
despairing
if
they
expect
our
ships
either
to
have
been
destroyed
aground
or
to
be
made
helpless
the
instant
combat
begins
we
may
give
them
a
shock
we
hoped
to
smash
them
ship
for
ship
finding
out
their
tricks
in
advance
may
give
us
that
and
if
our
missiles
work
as
they
promised
we
may
get
two
for
one
king
humphrey
voice
was
dogged
will
settle
for
anything
but
surrender
from
an
honorable
enemy
i
would
take
severe
terms
rather
than
see
my
spacemen
die
but
i
would
do
nobody
any
good
by
yielding
to
mekin
bors
clicked
off
he
looked
at
a
clock
the
prediction
from
talents
incorporated
was
that
the
mekinese
fleet
would
break
out
of
overdrive
at
hours
astronomical
time
he
went
over
his
ship
his
crew
was
by
no
means
depressed
there
had
been
a
terrific
lift
in
spirits
when
missiles
made
theoretic
hits
though
fifteen
interceptors
tried
to
stop
them
the
crewmen
now
tended
elaborately
to
explain
the
process
a
part
of
the
trick
was
the
curved
path
along
which
the
missiles
flashed
such
courses
alone
could
never
be
computed
by
an
unwarned
enemy
under
battle
conditions
but
the
thing
was
that
the
missiles
changed
their
acceleration
as
they
drove
that
could
be
solved
and
the
solution
put
into
practice
during
one
once
the
enemy
had
experienced
it
they
could
later
duplicate
it
without
doubt
but
it
would
still
be
impossible
to
counter
so
bors
men
were
cheerful
to
the
point
of
gaiety
they
would
fight
magnificently
because
they
were
thinking
of
what
they
would
do
to
the
enemy
instead
of
what
the
enemy
might
do
to
them
if
enemy
crews
had
been
assured
that
the
fleet
was
half
defeated
before
the
fight
began
to
find
the
fleet
not
crippled
by
devices
would
be
startling
to
find
them
fighting
like
fiends
would
be
alarming
and
if
bors
grimly
repeated
to
himself
the
modified
missiles
worked
as
well
in
battle
as
in
target
practice
he
turned
in
and
despite
his
tensions
fell
asleep
immediately
and
slept
soundly
when
he
awoke
he
felt
curiously
relaxed
it
took
him
a
moment
to
realize
he
had
dreamed
about
gwenlyn
he
could
remember
what
he
had
dreamed
but
he
knew
it
was
comfortable
and
good
he
would
let
himself
dwell
on
it
however
there
was
work
to
be
done
it
was
singularly
like
morning
on
a
planet
the
ship
was
spotless
immaculate
there
was
the
fresh
smell
of
growing
things
in
the
air
to
save
tanked
oxygen
the
used
vegetation
to
absorb
co
and
excess
moisture
from
the
breathing
of
the
crew
there
was
room
to
spare
everywhere
because
unlike
aircraft
and
surface
ships
the
size
of
a
made
no
difference
in
its
speed
there
was
no
resistance
due
to
size
only
the
mass
counted
so
there
was
spaciousness
and
freshness
and
something
close
to
elation
on
bors
ship
on
the
day
it
was
to
fight
for
the
high
satisfaction
of
getting
killed
bors
saw
to
it
that
his
men
breakfasted
heartily
we
got
a
party
ahead
he
told
the
watch
at
mess
eat
plenty
but
give
the
other
watch
a
chance
to
fill
up
too
somebody
said
cheerfully
the
condemned
men
ate
a
hearty
breakfast
sir
bors
grinned
the
breakfast
we
can
be
sure
of
the
condemned
part
we
have
something
to
say
about
that
some
mekinese
would
have
good
appetites
if
they
knew
what
ahead
of
them
one
word
do
waste
missiles
there
are
a
lot
of
mekin
ships
we
got
to
make
each
missile
count
there
was
laughter
he
went
to
the
control
room
he
checked
with
the
clock
shortly
after
the
other
watch
was
back
at
its
stations
he
calculated
carefully
the
enemy
fleet
would
break
out
of
overdrive
short
of
kandar
of
course
it
would
have
broken
out
once
before
to
correct
its
line
and
estimate
the
distance
to
its
destination
it
would
have
assembled
itself
at
that
breakout
point
but
it
would
still
arrive
in
a
disorderly
mob
one
point
of
arrival
could
not
be
too
closely
figured
at
the
high
speeds
of
overdrive
so
when
the
mekinese
came
they
would
not
be
in
formation
bors
called
the
flagship
when
the
planet
was
in
line
and
a
barrier
against
the
radio
waves
king
humphrey
voice
came
from
the
speaker
by
bors
side
what
majesty
said
bors
talents
incorporated
says
the
enemy
fleet
will
break
out
of
overdrive
in
just
about
ten
minutes
we
out
here
waiting
for
it
instead
of
aground
as
they
expect
they
break
out
in
complete
confusion
even
with
great
luck
they
lose
time
assembling
into
combat
formation
being
out
here
we
may
be
able
to
hit
them
before
they
organized
a
pause
been
discussing
tactics
with
the
high
said
the
voice
some
dispute
the
classic
tactic
is
to
try
for
i
want
to
point
out
majesty
bors
interrupted
urgently
that
when
we
cross
the
north
pole
again
we
apt
to
detect
the
fleet
signalling
frantically
to
itself
sorting
itself
out
trying
to
get
into
some
sort
of
order
it
be
stirred
up
as
if
with
a
spoon
but
if
we
come
around
the
planet
pole
and
they
do
expect
us
to
be
out
here
waiting
for
them
we
be
in
formation
we
may
be
able
to
tear
into
them
as
an
organized
unit
before
they
can
begin
to
with
each
other
a
longer
pause
then
king
humphrey
said
grimly
is
one
weak
point
in
your
proposal
bors
only
one
it
is
that
talents
incorporated
may
be
wrong
about
the
time
of
breakout
the
more
i
think
the
less
i
believe
in
what
they
have
done
or
even
what
i
saw
but
we
be
prepared
however
unlikely
your
idea
we
be
he
clicked
off
only
minutes
later
the
order
came
through
in
the
next
ten
minutes
bors
ship
hummed
for
five
was
quiet
for
three
and
then
two
minutes
early
all
inner
compartment
doors
closed
quietly
and
there
was
that
muffled
stillness
which
meant
that
everybody
was
ready
for
anything
that
might
happen
in
the
control
room
bors
watched
out
of
a
port
giving
occasional
glances
to
the
screens
there
were
flecks
of
light
from
innumerable
stars
then
the
shining
of
the
planet
went
black
screens
showed
all
of
the
fleet
each
blip
with
a
nimbus
about
it
which
identified
it
as
a
friend
not
a
foe
there
was
the
blip
of
the
leading
ship
the
point
of
the
formation
there
were
the
flanking
ships
and
all
the
martial
array
of
the
fleet
then
the
screens
sparkled
with
seemingly
hundreds
of
blips
which
seemed
to
swirl
and
spin
and
whirl
again
in
total
and
disordered
confusion
gongs
clanged
a
voice
said
enemy
fleet
ahead
wide
dispersion
they
milling
about
like
gnats
on
a
sunny
day
a
curt
and
authoritative
and
voice
snapped
ships
keep
formation
on
flagship
course
coordinates
the
voice
gave
them
a
clump
of
enemy
ships
beginning
to
organize
we
hit
them
the
fleet
of
kandar
came
around
the
world
and
flung
itself
at
the
fleet
of
mekin
it
seemed
that
everything
was
subject
to
intolerable
delay
for
long
sweating
unbearable
minutes
nothing
happened
except
that
the
fleet
of
kandar
went
hurtling
through
space
with
no
sensation
or
direct
evidence
of
motion
the
planet
dwindled
but
not
very
fast
the
bright
specks
on
the
screens
which
were
enemy
ships
seemed
to
separate
as
they
drew
nearer
but
all
happened
with
infinite
and
infuriating
deliberation
it
was
worth
waiting
for
there
was
truly
a
clumping
of
enemy
ships
ahead
some
of
them
were
less
than
ten
miles
apart
in
a
sphere
there
were
forty
ships
they
been
moving
to
consolidate
themselves
into
a
mutually
assisting
group
what
they
accomplished
was
the
provision
of
a
fine
accumulation
of
targets
before
they
could
organize
themselves
the
kandarian
fleet
swept
through
them
it
vastly
outnumbered
them
in
this
area
it
smashed
them
bombs
flashed
in
emptiness
there
were
and
which
stayed
behind
in
space
as
the
fleet
went
on
said
the
familiar
authoritative
voice
it
gave
them
another
enemy
condensation
we
hit
it
the
fleet
swung
in
space
it
drove
on
and
on
and
on
interminable
time
passed
then
there
were
flashes
brighter
than
the
stars
a
kandar
cruiser
blew
up
soundlessly
but
far
far
away
other
things
detonated
and
what
had
been
proud
structures
of
steel
and
beryllium
armed
and
manned
became
mere
incandescent
vapor
a
third
clumping
of
mekinese
ships
the
kandarian
fleet
overwhelmed
it
overrode
it
used
exactly
the
tactics
the
mekinese
might
have
used
it
ruthlessly
made
use
of
its
local
concentrated
strength
it
was
outnumbered
in
the
whole
battle
area
by
not
less
than
ten
to
one
but
the
mekinese
fleet
was
scattered
where
it
struck
the
kandarian
fleet
was
four
and
five
and
sometimes
twenty
ships
to
one
it
was
a
smaller
fleet
in
every
class
of
ships
but
it
was
compact
and
controlled
and
it
made
slashing
plunges
through
the
dispersed
and
confused
enemy
with
ordinary
missiles
three
ships
could
always
destroy
two
and
four
could
destroy
three
but
in
the
battle
of
the
planet
where
there
was
fighting
the
kandarians
were
never
less
than
two
to
one
they
were
surrounded
by
enemies
but
when
those
enemies
tried
to
gather
together
for
strength
the
mass
of
ships
of
kandar
swung
upon
the
incipient
group
and
blasted
it
nearly
half
the
mekinese
fleet
was
out
of
action
before
bors
ship
fired
a
single
missile
he
sat
in
the
skipper
chair
and
from
time
to
time
the
course
of
all
the
fleet
was
changed
and
he
saw
that
his
ship
kept
its
place
rigidly
in
formation
but
he
had
given
not
one
order
out
of
routine
before
the
enemy
strength
was
half
gone
then
the
communicator
said
coldly
ships
attention
with
missiles
we
could
do
everything
we
accomplished
so
far
but
the
mekinese
are
refusing
battle
now
they
begin
to
slip
away
in
overdrive
if
we
keep
chopping
them
down
in
groups
we
have
to
give
them
a
chance
or
they
run
away
the
new
missile
system
works
perfectly
all
ships
break
formation
find
your
own
mekinese
blast
them
bors
said
in
a
conversational
voice
there
are
three
mekin
ships
yonder
they
look
like
they
willing
to
start
something
we
take
them
on
he
pointed
carefully
to
a
spot
on
the
screen
his
small
ship
swung
away
from
the
rest
of
the
fleet
it
plunged
toward
a
battleship
and
two
heavy
cruisers
who
had
joined
forces
and
appeared
to
attempt
to
rally
the
invaders
they
became
objects
rather
than
specks
upon
the
screens
they
were
visible
things
on
the
ports
something
flashed
and
rushed
toward
the
little
kandarian
fire
one
two
three
bors
ordered
things
hurtled
on
before
him
a
screen
showed
that
the
missiles
first
fired
by
the
enemy
went
chasing
the
missiles
from
the
the
mekinese
shots
had
automatically
become
interceptors
when
kandarian
missiles
attacked
their
parent
ships
but
they
could
anticipate
a
curved
course
and
their
computers
were
designed
to
handle
a
rate
of
change
of
acceleration
the
three
mekinese
ships
ceased
to
exist
let
head
yonder
said
bors
he
pointed
again
on
the
screen
within
the
radar
range
there
were
hundreds
of
tiny
blips
some
were
marked
with
a
nimbus
apiece
they
were
friends
many
many
more
were
not
the
mekinese
fleet
too
could
determine
its
own
numbers
in
comparison
to
the
defending
fleet
pride
and
rage
swept
through
mekinese
commanders
as
they
saw
the
kandarians
deliberately
break
up
their
formation
to
get
their
ships
down
to
the
level
of
the
enemy
it
was
unthinkable
for
a
mekinese
ship
to
refuse
single
combat
and
when
two
and
three
could
combine
against
a
single
ship
of
kandar
the
invaders
had
reason
to
fight
rather
than
slip
into
overdrive
they
still
outnumbered
the
ships
from
kandar
and
for
a
mekinese
commander
to
flee
the
battle
area
without
having
engaged
or
fired
on
an
antagonist
would
be
treason
no
man
who
fled
without
fighting
would
stay
alive
there
had
to
be
a
recording
of
battle
offered
or
accepted
or
the
especially
merciless
system
of
mekin
would
take
over
there
was
one
problem
however
for
the
mekinese
skippers
when
they
engaged
a
ship
from
kandar
they
died
still
no
ship
left
the
scene
of
the
battle
to
report
defeat
it
was
absolute
and
complete
it
was
not
only
a
defeat
it
was
annihilation
the
mekinese
fleet
was
destroyed
to
the
last
ship
even
to
the
armed
transports
carrying
bureaucrats
and
police
to
set
up
a
new
government
on
kandar
those
ships
which
dared
not
run
away
without
a
token
fight
discovered
the
fleet
of
kandar
was
fighting
a
token
battle
it
had
started
out
to
be
just
that
but
somehow
the
plans
had
changed
when
the
fighting
started
for
the
aggressors
it
was
disaster
when
his
fleet
reassembled
king
humphrey
issued
a
general
order
to
all
ships
he
read
it
in
person
his
voice
strained
and
dead
and
hopeless
have
to
express
my
admiration
for
the
men
of
my
he
said
drearily
unexampled
victory
over
unexampled
odds
is
not
only
in
keeping
with
the
best
traditions
of
the
armed
forces
of
kandar
but
raises
those
traditions
to
the
highest
possible
level
of
valor
and
devotion
if
it
were
not
that
in
winning
this
victory
we
have
doomed
our
home
world
to
destruction
i
would
be
as
happy
as
i
am
reluctantly
proud
chapter
nobody
had
ever
found
any
use
for
the
glamis
solar
system
there
was
a
sun
of
highly
irregular
variability
there
were
two
planets
of
which
the
one
farther
out
might
have
been
useful
for
colonization
except
that
it
was
subject
to
extreme
changes
of
climate
as
its
undependable
sun
burned
brightly
or
dimly
the
nearer
planet
was
so
close
to
its
primary
that
it
had
long
ceased
to
rotate
one
hemisphere
forever
in
sunshine
remained
in
a
low
red
heat
its
night
hemisphere
in
perpetual
darkness
had
radiated
away
its
heat
until
there
were
mountains
of
frozen
atmosphere
piled
above
what
should
have
been
a
mineral
surface
it
was
a
matter
of
record
that
a
hundred
standard
years
before
a
ship
had
landed
there
and
mined
snow
which
its
air
apparatus
was
able
to
refine
so
the
crew
could
breathe
while
they
finished
some
rather
improbable
repairs
and
could
go
on
to
more
hospitable
worlds
the
planet
was
sometimes
a
place
of
green
vegetation
and
sprawling
seas
and
sometimes
of
humid
jungles
with
most
of
its
oceans
turned
to
a
of
impenetrable
thickness
also
sometimes
it
was
frozen
waste
from
pole
to
pole
the
vegetation
of
that
planet
had
been
studied
with
interest
but
the
world
itself
was
simply
of
no
use
to
anybody
even
the
sun
of
the
glamis
system
was
regarded
with
suspicion
the
fleet
of
kandar
made
rendezvous
at
the
pole
of
the
second
planet
on
arrival
the
massed
cruisers
and
battleships
went
into
orbit
the
smaller
craft
went
on
a
scouting
mission
verifying
that
there
was
no
new
colony
planted
that
there
was
no
radiation
anywhere
in
the
system
that
there
was
no
likelihood
of
the
presence
or
for
that
matter
its
continued
existence
becoming
known
to
anybody
not
of
its
the
came
back
reporting
all
clear
the
great
ships
drew
close
to
one
another
and
small
shuttled
back
and
forth
taking
commanders
and
captains
and
to
the
ship
which
by
convention
was
commanded
by
king
humphrey
viii
of
kandar
captain
bors
got
to
the
conference
late
there
were
some
grave
faces
about
the
conference
room
but
there
were
also
some
whose
expressions
were
unregenerate
and
grimly
satisfied
as
he
entered
the
room
the
king
was
speaking
i
do
deny
that
it
was
a
splendid
victory
but
i
saying
that
our
victory
was
a
catastrophe
to
begin
with
we
happened
to
hit
the
mekinese
fleet
when
it
was
dispersed
and
disorganized
that
was
great
good
fortune
we
wanted
a
victory
the
enemy
was
scattered
over
of
space
his
ships
could
not
act
as
a
massed
maneuverable
force
they
were
simply
a
mob
of
fighting
ships
who
had
to
fight
as
individuals
against
our
combat
formation
yes
majesty
said
the
gray
but
even
when
we
broke
formation
again
said
the
king
more
fretfully
still
i
do
not
deny
that
the
fighting
ability
of
our
ships
was
multiplied
by
the
new
way
of
using
missiles
what
i
do
say
is
that
if
we
come
upon
the
mekinese
fleet
in
combat
formation
instead
of
dispersed
if
we
attacked
them
when
they
were
ready
for
us
it
would
be
doubtful
that
we
have
been
so
disastrously
successful
say
that
the
new
missile
settings
gave
each
of
our
ships
as
effective
as
two
or
three
or
five
of
the
enemy
the
enemy
was
ten
to
one
if
we
had
hit
them
when
they
were
in
confusion
we
have
been
wiped
out
and
if
we
hit
their
fleet
anyhow
we
be
dead
we
did
not
hit
the
main
fleet
we
annihilated
a
division
of
it
a
small
part
we
are
still
hopelessly
inferior
to
the
vast
mekinese
fleet
bors
took
a
seat
at
the
rear
of
the
room
a
stout
said
somberly
we
hope
we
annihilated
it
majesty
there
no
report
of
any
ship
fleeing
in
overdrive
but
if
any
did
escape
its
report
would
lead
to
an
immediate
discovery
of
the
exact
improvement
in
our
missiles
i
am
saying
majesty
that
if
one
enemy
ship
escaped
that
battle
we
can
look
for
all
the
enemy
ships
to
be
equipped
with
revised
missiles
like
ours
bors
raised
his
voice
may
i
speak
ah
said
the
king
bors
by
all
means
i
make
two
points
said
bors
with
reserve
one
is
that
the
mekinese
are
as
likely
to
think
our
missiles
captured
theirs
as
that
they
were
uncomputable
missile
designers
have
been
trying
for
years
to
create
interceptors
which
capture
enemy
missiles
the
mekinese
may
decide
accomplished
something
they
failed
at
but
they
not
likely
to
think
we
accomplished
something
they
never
even
thought
of
voices
babbled
a
pompous
voice
said
firmly
that
nobody
would
be
so
absurd
several
others
said
urgently
that
it
was
very
likely
all
defense
departments
had
research
in
progress
working
on
the
capture
of
enemy
missiles
if
it
were
accomplished
ships
could
be
destroyed
as
a
matter
of
routine
bors
waited
until
the
king
thumped
on
the
table
for
silence
the
second
thing
i
have
to
say
majesty
is
that
there
can
be
no
plans
made
until
we
know
what
we
have
to
do
and
that
depends
on
what
mekin
thinks
has
happened
maybe
no
enemy
ship
got
home
maybe
some
ships
took
back
inaccurate
reports
it
would
be
very
uncomfortable
for
them
to
report
the
truth
maybe
they
said
we
had
some
new
and
marvellous
weapon
which
no
fleet
could
resist
in
that
case
we
are
in
a
very
fine
position
the
king
said
gloomily
you
think
of
abominably
clever
things
captain
but
i
am
afraid
we
been
too
clever
if
mekin
masses
its
entire
fleet
to
destroy
us
they
can
do
it
new
or
no
new
we
have
somehow
to
keep
them
from
resolving
to
do
just
that
which
said
bors
may
mean
negotiation
but
there
no
point
in
negotiating
unless
you
know
what
your
enemy
thinks
you
got
we
could
have
mekin
scared
there
was
a
murmur
which
could
not
be
said
to
be
either
agreement
or
disagreement
the
king
looked
about
him
we
can
not
continue
to
fight
he
said
sternly
not
unless
we
can
defend
kandar
which
we
ca
as
against
the
mekinese
main
fleet
we
were
prepared
to
sacrifice
our
lives
to
earn
respect
for
our
world
and
to
leave
a
tradition
behind
us
we
must
still
be
prepared
to
sacrifice
even
our
vanity
the
said
but
one
sacrifices
majesty
to
achieve
do
you
believe
that
mekin
will
honor
any
treaty
one
second
after
it
ceases
to
be
profitable
to
mekin
that
said
the
king
has
to
be
thought
about
but
bors
is
right
on
one
point
we
should
come
to
no
final
conclusion
without
information
majesty
bors
interrupted
his
words
came
slowly
as
if
an
idea
were
forming
as
he
spoke
the
enemy
may
have
no
news
at
all
they
may
know
they
been
defeated
but
they
expect
freedom
from
loss
why
could
a
single
kandarian
ship
turn
up
at
some
port
where
its
appearance
would
surely
be
reported
to
mekin
it
could
pose
as
the
sole
survivor
of
our
fleet
which
would
indicate
that
the
rest
of
us
were
wiped
out
in
the
battle
if
we
all
been
wiped
out
there
be
no
point
in
their
kandar
certainly
they
expected
us
to
be
destroyed
one
surviving
ship
can
prove
that
we
been
the
king
expression
brightened
ah
and
we
can
go
and
intern
ourselves
there
was
a
growl
the
pompous
voice
said
we
would
gain
time
majesty
our
fear
is
that
mekin
may
feel
it
must
avenge
a
defeat
but
if
one
ship
claims
to
be
the
sole
survivor
of
our
fleet
it
announces
a
mekinese
victory
that
is
a
highly
desirable
thing
the
king
nodded
we
were
unwise
to
survive
the
battle
we
can
hide
our
unwisdom
captain
bors
i
will
give
you
orders
presently
as
of
now
i
will
accept
reports
on
given
and
received
as
bors
saluted
and
turned
to
the
door
the
king
added
i
will
be
with
the
pretender
presently
it
was
an
order
and
bors
obeyed
it
he
went
to
find
his
uncle
he
found
the
former
monarch
in
the
king
cabin
of
this
the
largest
ship
of
the
fleet
the
pretender
greeted
bors
unhappily
a
very
bad
business
he
observed
bad
agreed
bors
but
for
the
two
of
us
a
defeat
for
mekin
is
not
bad
news
for
us
and
tralee
the
old
man
said
reprovingly
there
is
some
pleasure
but
it
is
still
bad
every
ship
we
destroyed
must
be
replaced
like
every
other
subject
planet
tralee
will
be
required
to
build
how
many
ships
ten
twenty
we
have
increased
the
burden
mekin
lays
on
tralee
and
worse
much
worse
there
such
a
thing
protested
bors
as
using
a
microscope
on
troubles
we
did
something
we
badly
wanted
to
if
we
can
keep
it
up
the
pretender
said
how
is
the
on
your
ship
how
long
can
you
feed
your
crew
without
supplies
from
some
base
bors
swore
the
question
had
the
impact
of
a
blow
his
like
the
rest
of
the
fleet
had
taken
off
from
kandar
to
fight
and
be
destroyed
there
were
emergency
rations
on
board
of
course
but
the
compartments
had
been
filled
the
fleet
did
not
expect
to
go
on
living
so
it
did
not
prepare
to
go
on
eating
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
carry
stores
for
months
when
they
expected
to
live
only
hours
it
simply
had
occurred
to
anyone
to
load
provisions
for
a
long
operation
away
from
base
that
what
the
king
is
worrying
about
said
the
pretender
some
thousands
of
men
who
will
be
hungry
presently
if
we
reveal
that
we
survived
the
battle
mekin
tributaries
will
begin
to
think
they
might
even
hope
which
mekin
would
have
to
stop
immediately
if
we
do
not
reveal
that
we
still
exist
what
can
be
done
about
starving
it
is
a
bad
business
it
would
have
been
much
better
if
the
fleet
had
been
destroyed
as
we
expected
in
a
gesture
of
pure
fury
over
its
own
helplessness
bors
said
sardonically
we
can
all
commit
suicide
of
course
the
pretender
did
not
answer
his
nephew
sank
into
a
chair
and
glowered
at
the
wall
the
situation
was
contrary
to
all
the
illusions
cherished
by
the
human
race
to
act
decently
and
with
honor
is
somehow
fitting
to
a
man
and
consistent
with
the
nature
of
the
universe
so
that
decency
and
honor
may
prosper
but
recent
events
denied
it
men
who
were
willing
to
die
for
their
countrymen
only
injured
them
by
the
attempt
and
now
the
conduct
which
honor
would
approve
turned
upon
them
to
bring
the
consequences
of
treason
and
villainy
a
long
time
passed
bors
sat
with
clenched
hands
it
was
the
barbaric
insistence
of
mekin
upon
conquest
that
was
at
fault
of
course
but
this
happens
everywhere
as
it
has
throughout
all
history
there
are
really
three
kinds
of
people
in
every
community
as
there
have
always
been
there
are
the
barbarians
and
there
are
the
tribesmen
and
there
are
the
civilized
this
was
true
when
men
lived
on
only
one
planet
and
doubtless
was
true
when
the
first
village
was
built
there
were
civilized
men
even
then
if
there
was
progress
they
brought
it
about
and
in
every
village
there
were
and
are
tribesmen
men
who
placidly
accept
the
circumstances
into
which
they
are
born
and
who
wish
no
change
at
all
and
everywhere
and
at
all
times
there
are
barbarians
they
seek
personal
triumphs
they
thrive
on
high
emotional
victories
and
at
no
time
will
barbarians
ever
leave
either
civilized
men
or
tribesmen
alone
they
crave
triumphs
over
them
and
each
other
and
they
create
disaster
everywhere
until
they
are
crushed
bors
said
evenly
if
the
king
planning
to
surrender
the
fleet
to
mekin
as
ransom
for
kandar
it
wo
work
he
considering
it
said
his
uncle
it
will
be
a
way
of
giving
them
the
victory
we
cheated
them
of
though
we
did
intend
to
win
it
wo
work
repeated
bors
it
wo
do
a
bit
of
good
they
want
to
punish
kandar
because
it
was
beaten
they
feed
on
destruction
and
brutality
they
barbarians
the
economic
interpretation
of
history
does
apply
here
the
mekinese
who
run
things
to
be
evil
they
will
be
until
they
crushed
crushed
asked
the
pretender
bitterly
is
there
a
chance
of
that
bors
considered
gravely
then
he
said
i
think
so
the
door
opened
and
the
king
came
in
bors
rose
and
the
king
nodded
he
spoke
to
the
pretender
somebody
raised
the
question
of
food
he
said
there
is
any
to
speak
of
of
course
you
think
grown
men
would
face
facts
there
not
a
man
willing
to
accept
what
is
and
work
from
that
lunatics
he
flung
himself
into
a
chair
suggested
he
continued
that
a
part
of
the
fleet
go
to
norden
to
buy
food
and
bring
it
back
of
course
mekin
would
hear
about
it
guess
at
the
survival
of
the
fleet
because
food
was
bought
in
such
quantities
suggested
that
a
part
of
the
fleet
go
to
some
uncolonized
planet
and
hunt
meat
try
to
imagine
success
in
that
venture
suggested
that
we
travel
a
long
distance
pick
out
a
relatively
small
world
land
and
seize
its
spaceport
and
facilities
and
equip
ourselves
to
bomb
mekin
to
extinction
and
do
it
in
a
surprise
attack
suggested
the
king
shook
his
head
angrily
he
did
not
look
royal
he
did
not
look
confident
he
looked
embittered
and
even
helpless
but
he
still
looked
like
a
very
honest
man
trying
to
make
up
for
his
admitted
deficiencies
majesty
said
bors
the
king
turned
his
eyes
you
going
to
send
me
off
for
news
said
bors
i
suggested
earlier
that
my
ship
pretend
to
be
the
sole
survivor
of
the
fleet
i
suggest
now
that
the
ship
add
the
wild
and
desperate
boast
that
since
there
no
longer
a
world
which
will
sponsor
it
it
turned
pirate
it
will
take
vengeance
on
its
own
it
defies
the
might
of
mekin
and
it
dares
the
mekinese
fleet
to
do
something
about
it
why
asked
the
king
pirates
bors
answered
controlling
his
enthusiasm
have
to
be
hunted
down
it
takes
many
ships
to
hunt
down
a
pirate
i
should
be
able
to
keep
a
slice
of
the
mekinese
navy
busy
simply
lying
in
wait
for
me
here
and
there
and
there
are
which
carry
food
from
the
subject
worlds
to
mekin
hating
mekin
as
befits
the
sole
survivor
of
this
fleet
majesty
it
would
be
natural
for
me
to
capture
such
ships
even
if
i
could
do
nothing
better
with
them
than
send
them
out
to
space
to
be
wasted
they
would
be
wasted
naturally
they
come
here
the
king
said
but
you
could
supply
the
fleet
indefinitely
bors
nodded
agreement
but
he
waited
you
may
try
said
the
king
querulously
have
you
something
else
up
your
sleeve
bors
nodded
in
his
turn
do
tell
me
what
it
is
said
the
king
so
long
as
the
fleet
gets
some
food
and
its
existence
is
known
if
i
knew
what
you
up
to
i
might
feel
i
had
to
object
i
think
not
majesty
bors
said
showing
a
rare
smile
i
need
some
extra
men
if
i
do
capture
they
be
useful
i
ca
imagine
that
anything
would
be
useful
said
the
king
bitterly
tell
the
admiral
to
give
them
to
you
bors
saluted
and
left
the
room
he
went
directly
to
the
admiral
who
in
theory
was
second
in
command
only
while
the
king
was
aboard
he
explained
his
mission
and
some
of
his
intentions
the
admiral
listened
stonily
i
give
you
fifty
men
he
said
i
think
you
be
killed
of
course
but
if
you
live
long
enough
to
convince
them
that
the
been
destroyed
you
be
of
service
what
bors
asked
with
a
trace
of
humor
can
possibly
be
done
about
the
fact
that
we
wiped
out
a
mekinese
fleet
instead
of
letting
it
exterminate
us
the
matter
the
admiral
answered
seriously
is
under
consideration
bors
shrugged
and
went
to
his
own
ship
the
he
was
excessively
uncomfortable
he
said
to
his
uncle
and
implied
to
the
king
that
he
had
some
plan
in
mind
he
did
but
it
angered
him
to
know
that
he
counted
on
assistance
that
in
theory
he
could
not
possibly
accomplish
it
alone
it
was
irritating
to
realize
that
he
expected
gwenlyn
and
her
father
to
turn
up
with
their
talents
when
absolutely
nobody
outside
of
the
fleet
could
possibly
imagine
where
the
fleet
had
gone
on
kandar
it
must
be
assumed
by
now
that
it
was
dead
his
ship
boat
clanked
into
position
in
the
lifeboat
blister
the
valves
closed
on
it
a
moment
later
there
was
a
whistling
murmur
and
the
boat
clouded
over
outside
and
then
cleared
he
stepped
out
into
the
ship
atmosphere
his
greeted
him
in
the
i
was
trying
to
reach
you
at
the
flagship
sir
he
said
the
yacht
is
lying
a
few
miles
off
her
owner
has
forwarded
news
reports
to
the
flagship
he
asks
that
you
receive
him
when
you
can
sir
bors
apparent
lack
of
surprise
was
real
he
was
surprised
but
he
was
annoyed
with
himself
for
expecting
something
so
impossible
as
the
tracing
the
fleet
through
an
overdrive
voyage
of
days
to
a
most
unlikely
destination
like
glamis
tell
him
to
come
aboard
he
commanded
he
went
to
talk
to
the
mess
officer
reflecting
that
he
would
ask
the
morgans
how
the
had
known
where
to
come
and
they
tell
him
and
it
would
be
extremely
unlikely
and
he
would
accept
the
explanation
the
looked
harassed
at
the
news
of
fifty
additional
crewmen
to
be
fed
principles
of
prudence
and
common
sense
said
bors
do
apply
any
more
we
feed
them
somehow
he
went
back
to
the
when
morgan
appeared
beaming
expansively
bors
was
again
unsurprised
to
see
gwenlyn
with
him
logan
the
mathematics
talent
followed
in
their
wake
looking
indifferently
about
him
we
wiped
out
the
fleet
headed
for
kandar
bors
observed
i
suppose
that
news
to
you
morgan
cheerfully
shook
his
head
and
we
in
considerably
more
trouble
than
before
is
that
news
no
admitted
morgan
it
reasonable
for
you
to
be
then
damnit
i
going
off
on
a
cruise
alone
said
bors
is
that
news
we
brought
logan
said
morgan
to
go
with
you
he
be
useful
that
talents
incorporated
information
and
i
can
depend
on
it
said
bors
dourly
in
plain
common
sense
the
odds
are
rather
high
against
my
accomplishing
anything
such
as
coming
back
morgan
looked
at
his
daughter
he
grinned
we
heard
gloom
from
him
the
other
day
before
a
certain
did
we
he
turned
back
to
bors
look
captain
our
talents
prophesy
precognition
simply
says
that
when
there
are
so
many
thousand
ways
an
event
in
the
future
can
happen
then
in
one
of
those
several
thousand
ways
it
will
precognition
does
say
which
way
it
say
how
especially
it
does
say
why
but
we
have
a
very
firm
precognition
by
a
very
reliable
talent
that
you
be
alive
and
doing
something
very
specific
a
year
from
now
so
we
assume
you
wo
be
permanently
killed
in
the
meantime
but
anything
else
can
happen
more
or
less
admitted
morgan
what
will
happen
we
do
know
said
morgan
again
someday
i
may
take
you
aside
and
explain
the
facts
of
precognition
and
other
talents
as
i
understand
them
i
probably
quite
wrong
but
i
do
know
better
than
to
try
to
pry
certain
kinds
of
information
from
my
talents
right
now
i
going
to
try
to
capture
a
what
you
might
call
a
loaded
with
food
for
mekin
tralee
said
morgan
with
finality
you
try
there
will
i
capture
a
there
asked
bors
how
the
devil
would
i
know
morgan
snapped
you
asked
the
wrong
question
said
gwenlyn
cheerfully
if
you
asked
if
there
a
down
on
tralee
loading
foodstuffs
for
mekin
there
can
be
an
answer
to
that
is
there
at
the
moment
yes
morgan
answered
so
the
dowsing
talent
says
then
i
go
there
said
bors
i
thought
you
might
said
morgan
he
looked
at
his
daughter
may
i
come
along
asked
gwenlyn
with
an
assortment
of
talents
my
father
going
to
have
long
conferences
with
the
king
he
need
some
talents
here
to
work
out
things
but
i
could
go
along
on
your
ship
with
a
few
of
the
others
we
could
help
a
lot
no
said
bors
grimly
i
thought
not
said
morgan
very
well
logan
you
help
captain
bors
i
sure
the
math
talent
said
offhandedly
any
calculations
he
needs
of
course
he
looked
about
him
with
a
confident
modestly
complacent
air
bors
walked
with
morgan
and
his
daughter
to
the
airlock
he
turned
to
gwenlyn
i
do
mean
to
be
ungallant
refusing
to
let
you
run
risks
i
flattered
but
annoyed
gwenlyn
answered
it
means
i
have
to
take
drastic
measures
luck
she
and
her
father
went
into
the
the
blister
doors
closed
bors
went
back
to
the
control
room
he
began
to
set
up
the
computations
for
astrogation
from
the
sun
of
glamis
to
the
sun
of
tralee
he
shortly
heard
the
sound
of
arrivals
via
the
airlock
presently
his
reported
fifty
additional
hands
aboard
they
included
astrogators
and
assorted
specialists
after
clearance
with
the
flagship
the
little
warship
aimed
with
painstaking
exactitude
at
tralee
sun
making
due
allowance
for
its
proper
motion
glamis
proper
motion
the
length
of
time
the
light
he
aimed
by
had
been
on
its
way
the
distance
and
the
in
overdrive
presently
bors
said
overdrive
coming
and
counted
down
after
one
he
pressed
a
button
there
was
the
singularly
unpleasant
sensation
of
going
into
overdrive
then
the
small
fighting
ship
was
alone
in
its
cocoon
of
warped
and
twisted
space
until
it
came
out
again
there
was
no
possible
way
by
which
any
message
could
reach
it
or
its
existence
be
detected
or
proved
theory
said
in
fact
that
the
cosmos
could
explode
and
a
ship
in
overdrive
would
be
unaware
of
the
fact
so
long
as
it
stayed
in
overdrive
but
bors
light
cruiser
came
out
where
the
sun
of
tralee
was
a
disk
of
intolerable
brilliance
and
all
the
stars
in
every
direction
looked
exactly
as
usual
chapter
the
approached
tralee
from
the
night
side
and
at
a
time
when
the
planet
spaceport
faced
the
sun
tralee
was
not
a
base
for
mekinese
to
the
contrary
it
was
strictly
a
conquered
world
it
was
desirable
for
mekinese
ships
to
be
able
to
appear
as
if
magically
and
without
warning
in
its
skies
there
would
be
no
radars
on
the
planet
except
at
its
solitary
spaceport
mekinese
ships
could
come
out
of
overdrive
time
a
approach
to
arrive
at
tralee
atmosphere
in
darkness
and
be
hovering
menacingly
overhead
when
dawn
broke
such
an
appearance
had
strong
psychological
effects
upon
the
population
bors
used
the
same
device
with
modifications
his
ship
plunged
out
of
the
sunrise
and
across
half
a
continent
descending
as
it
flew
when
it
reached
the
planet
capital
city
there
had
been
less
than
a
minute
between
the
first
notification
by
radar
and
its
visibility
when
it
came
into
sight
at
the
spaceport
it
was
less
than
four
thousand
feet
high
and
it
went
sweeping
for
the
at
something
over

across

entered

the

had
consumed
not
more
than
five
minutes
from
the
appearance
of
a
blip
on
a
spaceport
radar
screen
to
the
beginning
of
a
broadcast
bors
turned
on
the
receiver
and
listened
to
the
harsh
voice
especially
chosen
from
among
the
crew
which
now
came
out
of
every
operating
broadcast
receiver
on
the
planet
to
the
people
of
tralee
there
is
aground
on
tralee
a
ship
with
no
home
planet
nor
any
loyalty
except
to
its
hatred
of
mekin
we
were
part
of
the
fleet
of
kandar
until
that
fleet
was
destroyed
now
we
fight
mekin
alone
we
are
pirates
we
are
outcasts
but
we
still
have
arms
to
defend
ourselves
with
we
demand
a
voice
said
curtly
in
bors
ear
secured
sir
take
off
on
rockets
and
maneuver
as
ordered
said
bors
then
rendezvous
as
arranged
he
returned
his
attention
to
the
broadcast
it
was
a
deliberately
savage
painstakingly
desperate
carefully
terrifying
message
to
the
people
of
tralee
it
demanded
supplies
and
arms
on
threat
of
destroying
the
city
around
it
a
single
one
of
its
as
a
matter
of
fact
could
have
done
a
good
job
of
destruction
on
this
metropolis
the
broadcast
would
be
a
shattering
experience
to
men
who
had
reconciled
themselves
to
subjugation
by
the
rulers
of
mekin
the
planet
tralee
was
now
governed
for
the
benefit
of
mekin
by
the
kind
of
men
who
would
do
such
work
they
knew
that
they
could
stay
in
office
only
so
long
as
mekin
upheld
them
to
hear
their
protectors
denounced
if
only
by
a
single
voice
there
was
a
monstrous
roaring
outside
the
took
off
for
the
skies
it
was
a
thousand
feet
high
before
the
weapons
on
the
stirred
it
seemed
to
those
below
that
the
pirate
crew
was
taken
unawares
by
the
escape
that
was
part
of
bors
plan
a
weapon
of
the
grounded
roared
a
missile
hurtled
after
the
fugitive
and
missed
it
went
on
past
its
apparent
target
and
did
not
even
detonate
at
nearest
proximity
as
it
should
have
done
it
vanished
and
the
continued
to
rise
in
seemingly
panicky
fashion
it
slanted
from
its
headlong
lift
and
curved
away
and
darted
for
emptiness
at
its
maximum
acceleration
a
second
missile
from
the
missed
the
dwindled
and
dwindled
and
now
the
appeared
to
take
deliberate
measurements
of
the
distance
and
acceleration
of
its
target
it
might
be
assumed
that
its
radars
needed
to
be
readjusted
from
the
required
in

to
the
measurements
called
for
now
something
plunged
after
the
fleeing

now
merely
a
in
the
blue
the
rising
object
moved
so
swiftly
that
it
was
invisible
then
it
detonated
and
the
fumes
of
the
explosion
blotted
out
the
fugitive
when
they
cleared
the
sky
was
empty
there
had
now
been
a
lapse
of
less
than
ten
minutes
from
the
first
sighting
of
the
screaming
toward
the
spaceport
the
had
been
destroyed
and
the
which
seemed
to
flee
had
apparently
been
destroyed
when
someone
had
leisure
to
think
it
would
appear
that
the
crew
had
overcome
the
armed
party
which
entered
it
and
then
taken
the
foolish
course
of
flight
bors
waited
listening
absently
a
voice
clear
on
board
the
prize
sir
the
cargo
seems
to
be
mostly
foodstuffs
sir
proceeding
to
rendezvous
as
ordered
bors
nodded
automatically
and
resumed
listening
to
the
broadcast
matters
were
going
well
everything
had
gone
through
with
the
precision
of
clockwork
which
meant
simply
that
bors
had
planned
in
detail
something
that
had
never
been
anticipated
and
so
had
not
been
before
anyone
on
tralee
realized
that
anything
had
happened
everything
had
happened
the
aground
the
demolished
the
grid
taken
over
and
a
fleeing
apparently
destroyed
in
the
upper
atmosphere
and
a
harsh
voice
now
rasped
out
of
loudspeakers
everywhere
uttering
threats
cursing
mekin
few
could
believe
their
ears
and
rousing
hopes
which
bors
knew
regretfully
were
bound
to
be
disappointed
the
rasping
broadcast
cut
off
in
the
middle
of
a
syllable
somebody
had
come
to
believe
that
he
really
heard
what
he
thought
he
heard
now
there
would
be
reaction
at
the
on
tralee
only
a
handful
of
people
were
awake
they
were
dumbfounded
where
people
breakfasted
the
intentionally
savage
voice
made
food
seem
unimportant
where
it
was
midday
waves
of
violent
emotion
swept
over
the
land
call
the
defense
forces
bors
commanded
the
grid
office
by
transmitter
they
be
mekinese
anyhow
we
want
them
to
get
ideas
of
attacking
us
so
identify
us
as
the
pirate
ship
and
order
all
police
and
garrison
troops
to
stay
exactly
where
they
are
say
we
got
all
our
armed
to
go
off
in
case
of
an
hit
this
was
the
most
valid
of
all
possible
threats
against
the
most
probable
form
of
attack
could
be
used
against
enemies
in
space
or
for
the
annihilation
of
a
population
but
they
could
not
be
used
in
police
operations
against
a
subject
people
to
coerce
people
one
must
avoid
destroying
them
so
while
a
ship
the
size
of
the
could
and
did
carry
enough
confined
hellfire
in
its
missile
warheads
to
destroy
an
area
hundreds
of
miles
across
the
occupation
troops
of
mekin
could
not
use
such
weapons
they
needed
for
minor
threats
and
artillery
for
selective
destruction
in
any
case
no
sane
man
would
try
to
destroy
the
aground
after
an
announcement
that
its
bombs
were
armed
and
that
they
were
fused
to
explode
now
repeat
the
demand
for
stores
ordered
bors
we
might
as
well
stock
up
speed
is
essential
we
ca
use
stores
they
time
to
or
poison
give
them
twenty
minutes
to
start
the
stuff
arriving
demand
fuel
extra
especially
remind
them
about
our
bombs
he
waited
speakers
beside
him
could
inform
him
of
any
action
anywhere
outside
or
inside
the
ship
the
in
the
spaceport
building
reported
as
it
went
through
the
spaceport
records
picking
up
such
information
concerning
mekinese
commercial
regulations
and
anticipated
as
might
prove
useful
elsewhere
the
rasping
voice
began
to
broadcast
again
it
went
on
for
fifteen
seconds
and
cut
off
tell
the
government
broadcasting
system
that
if
they
stop
relaying
our
broadcast
said
bors
we
heave
a
bomb
into
the
police
barracks
and
the
he
heard
the
threat
issued
and
very
soon
thereafter
an
agitated
voice
announced
to
the
people
of
tralee
that
a
pirate
ship
was
in
possession
of
the
planet
spaceport
and
that
it
insisted
upon
broadcasting
to
the
planet
people
it
was
considered
unwise
to
refuse
therefore
the
broadcast
would
continue
but
of
course
citizens
could
turn
off
their
sets
there
came
a
roar
of
anger
and
the
broadcaster
returned
to
the
air
his
taped
broadcast
had
run
out
now
he
bellowed
such
subversive
profanity
directed
at
the
officials
of
that
bors
smiled
sourly
it
was
not
good
for
mekinese
prestige
to
have
a
subject
people
know
that
one
ship
could
defy
the
empire
even
for
minutes
it
was
still
less
desirable
to
have
the
members
of
the
puppet
government
described
as
dogs
of
particularly
described
breeds
of
particularly
described
characteristics
and
particular
lack
of
legitimacy
bors
had
chosen
for
his
broadcast
a
man
of
vivid
imagination
and
large
vocabulary
he
did
not
want
the
to
appear
under
discipline
lest
it
seem
to
act
under
orders
he
wanted
to
create
the
impression
of
men
turned
pirates
because
everything
they
lived
for
had
been
destroyed
and
who
now
were
running
amok
among
the
planets
mekin
had
subjugated
the
broadcast
was
not
incitement
to
revolt
because
bors
ship
was
posing
as
the
only
survivor
of
a
planet
fleet
but
it
conveyed
such
contempt
and
derision
and
hatred
of
all
things
mekinese
that
for
months
to
come
men
would
whisper
jokes
based
on
what
an
crewman
had
said
on
tralee
air
the
respect
the
planet
officials
craved
would
drop
below
its
former
low
level
time
passed
bors
of
course
could
not
send
a
anywhere
lest
it
be
sniped
he
had
actually
accomplished
the
purpose
for
which
he
landed
the
getting
of
a
shipload
of
food
out
to
space
the
announcement
of
the
destruction
of
kandar
fleet
and
the
spreading
of
contempt
and
derision
for
mekin
in
tralee
now
he
had
to
keep
anyone
from
suspecting
the
importance
of
the
the
demand
for
stores
was
a
for
things
already
done
but
that
had
to
be
completed
vehicles
appeared
at
the
edge
of
the
figures
advanced
individually
waving
white
flags
bors
sent
men
out
with
small
arms
to
get
their
messages
these
were
the
supplies
he
demanded
food
more
food
the
vehicles
trundled
into
the
open
and
stopped
men
from
the
waved
away
the
drivers
and
took
over
the
trucks
they
brought
most
of
them
to
the
ship
side
a
came
into
the
control
room
and
saluted
sir
he
said
briskly
one
of
the
drivers
told
me
his
load
of
grub
had
in
it
the
secret
police
use
and
here
sir
to
keep
the
people
terrified
he
says
the
bombs
will
go
off
after
we
out
in
space
sir
what
did
you
do
asked
bors
i
pretended
the
truck
stalled
and
i
could
start
it
two
other
drivers
tipped
off
our
men
we
left
those
trucks
and
some
others
out
on
the
field
so
the
drivers
would
be
suspected
of
alerting
us
good
work
said
bors
better
put
detectors
on
all
parcels
from
all
trucks
before
bringing
them
aboard
can
be
made
very
tricky
indeed
but
when
they
are
used
by
secret
police
bors
allowed
himself
to
rage
for
a
moment
only
at
the
idea
of
that
kind
of
terrorism
practiced
by
a
government
on
its
supposed
citizens
it
would
be
intended
to
enforce
the
totalitarian
idea
that
what
is
not
commanded
for
the
ordinary
citizen
to
do
is
forbidden
to
him
but
and
would
be
standardized
he
had
allowed
time
for
complex
devices
to
be
made
detectors
would
pick
out
any
ordinary
trickery
the
broadcaster
continued
to
harangue
the
population
of
tralee
of
which
the
least
of
his
words
was
high
treason
they
enjoyed
the
broadcast
very
much
presently
bors
began
to
fidget
the
had
been
aground
for
minutes
he
had
sat
in
the
control
room
that
whole
time
supervising
a
operation
he
had
had
to
supervise
it
nobody
else
could
have
planned
and
carried
it
out
but
it
was
not
heroic
he
had
the
line
officer
inherent
scorn
for
administrative
officers
who
are
necessary
but
not
glamorous
or
admired
he
was
stuck
with
just
that
kind
of
duty
now
but
he
fretted
the
local
officials
were
given
time
to
get
over
their
panic
they
ought
to
be
planning
some
by
this
time
he
called
the
spaceport
office
there
should
be
a
map
of
the
city
somewhere
about
he
said
crisply
send
it
along
special
bring
a
communicator
if
you
find
any
new
or
old
we
want
them
said
a
brisk
voice
broadcast
right
sir
it
is
said
bors
you
mining
the
grid
we
blow
it
before
we
leave
there
no
point
in
letting
mekin
set
down
transports
loaded
with
troops
to
punish
innocent
people
because
they
heard
the
mekinese
accurately
described
make
land
on
rockets
and
there
wo
be
so
many
landing
sir
will
do
a
click
bors
heard
heavy
materials
being
loaded
aboard
each
object
was
being
examined
by
a
detector
the
loading
process
stopped
bors
pressed
a
button
what
happened
he
demanded
like
a
box
said
a
voice
the
supplies
take
it
off
a
hundred
yards
and
riddle
it
ordered
bors
this
may
settle
a
problem
for
us
bors
fidgeted
again
a
messenger
from
the
building
arrived
he
had
a
map
of
the
capital
city
of
tralee
there
was
an
explosion
a
violent
one
bors
looked
out
a
port
and
saw
where
the
suspected
parcel
had
been
set
up
as
a
target
a
hundred
yards
from
the
ship
it
had
been
riddled
with
bolts
and
had
exploded
it
might
not
have
destroyed
the
if
it
had
exploded
in
space
but
it
would
not
have
done
it
any
good
bors
pushed
the
button
for
the
compartment
throw
out
all
the
stuff
loaded
so
far
he
commanded
some
of
it
may
be
like
that
last
one
we
wo
take
a
chance
heave
it
all
out
again
bors
gave
other
orders
the
broadcast
stopped
bors
own
voice
went
out
on
the
air
captain
bors
pirate
ship
speaking
he
said
coldly
we
demanded
supplies
they
were
sent
us
we
have
found
one
included
in
retaliation
for
this
attempted
assassination
we
are
going
to
lob
missiles
into
the
principal
government
buildings
of
this
city
we
give
three
leeway
for
clerks
and
other
persons
to
get
clear
of
those
buildings
the
three
minutes
start
now
the
sun
shone
tranquilly
on
the
planet
tralee
white
clouds
floated
with
infinite
leisureliness
across
the
blue
sky
there
was
no
motion
of
any
sort
within
the
wide
open
area
of
the
over
a
large
part
of
this
world
surface
all
activity
had
stopped
while
men
listened
to
a
broadcast
fifteen
seconds
gone
said
bors
icily
he
wrote
out
an
order
and
passed
it
for
execution
thirty
seconds
gone
from
twenty
giant
buildings
in
the
city
a
black
tide
of
running
figures
began
to
pour
when
they
reached
the
street
they
went
on
running
they
wanted
to
get
as
far
as
possible
from
the
buildings
bors
had
said
would
be
destroyed
seconds
gone
said
bors
implacably
a
voice
spoke
from
the
building
where
men
were
now
placing
explosives
with
precisely
calculated
effects
the
voice
came
on
microwaves
to
the
ship
said
the
voice
reporting
sylva
breakout
from
overdrive
and
asks
coordinates
for
landing
purpose
of
visit
bors
swore
then
smiled
to
himself
gwenlyn
had
threatened
to
do
something
drastic
say
landing
forbidden
he
commanded
an
instant
later
advise
immediate
departure
he
pressed
a
button
and
said
evenly
one
minute
gone
in
two
minutes
more
we
send
our
bombs
and
take
off
streets
outside
the
government
buildings
were
filled
from
to
by
clerks
drafted
to
staff
the
incredible
arbitrary
government
set
up
on
its
tributary
worlds
by
mekin
bors
scribbled
a
list
of
buildings
to
be
ranged
on
the
map
from
the
spaceport
office
would
help
he
marked
the
ministry
of
police
which
would
contain
the
records
essential
to
the
operation
of
the
police
system
anything
that
happened
to
those
records
would
be
so
much
good
fortune
for
tralee
and
so
much
bad
for
the
master
race
and
its
quislings
he
marked
the
ministry
of
the
interior
which
would
house
the
machinery
for
requisitions
of
tribute
to
mekin
the
ministry
of
public
order
would
be
the
headquarters
of
the
secret
and
the
political
police
it
ran
the
camps
it
filed
all
anonymous
accusations
it
kept
records
on
all
persons
suspected
of
the
crime
of
patriotism
if
anything
happened
to
those
records
it
would
be
all
to
the
good

damn
all

then
into

there

for

he
cut
back
to

to

almost
instantly
curt

continued
in

there
were
boomings
which
rose
to
bellowings
as
devastation
tore
away
from
the
bors
said
irritably
to
the
take
her
up
and
then
the
ship
lifted
on
her
rockets
they
were
not
solely
for
emergency
use
as
on
and
rushed
toward
the
sky
as
the
ship
mounted
on
its
column
of
writhing
smoke
other
smoky
columns
spouted
up
six
of
them
but
they
were
limited
they
went
up
two
thousand
feet
and
then
tended
to
mushroom
bits
of
debris
went
higher
and
spread
more
widely
and
for
a
time
there
were
fragments
of
buildings
and
their
contents
flying
wildly
about
but
the
ship
went
straight
upward
the
city
and
the
open
country
beyond
it
shrank
swiftly
the
spouted
smokes
of
explosions
in
the
city
were
left
behind
mountains
appeared
at
one
horizon
and
a
sea
at
another
then
the
vast
expanse
of
the
planet
suddenly
acquired
a
curved
edge
and
the
ship
again
went
up
and
up
while
the
sky
turned
dark
and
some
stars
appeared
in
futile
competition
with
the
sun
and
the
surface
of
tralee
became
visibly
the
near
side
of
an
enormous
globe
then
the
planet
became
plainly
what
it
was
a
great
ball
floating
in
space
of
it
brilliant
in
the
sunshine
and
one
part
of
it
bathed
in
night
bors
put
on
the
drive
and
changed
course
a
voice
came
through
pirate
ship
calling
pirate
ship
space
sylva
pirate
ship
bors
growled
into
a
microphone
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
in
this
place
what
happened
gwenlyn
voice
bland
and
amused
happened
but
we
got
some
news
for
you
make
rendezvous
at
the
fourth
planet
bors
swore
again
that
was
where
he
was
to
meet
the
captured
and
sent
aloft
supposedly
destroyed
on
tralee
but
he
drove
on
out
around
and
away
from
tralee
he
was
reasonably
satisfied
with
his
landing
on
tralee
with
some
luck
the
news
of
the
landing
of
a
lone
survivor
of
the
kandarian
fleet
might
reach
mekin
before
it
was
aware
of
what
had
happened
to
its
occupation
force
with
a
little
more
luck
the
attention
of
mekin
would
be
devoted
more
to
a
ship
which
dared
to
turn
pirate
than
to
kandar
itself
with
unlimited
favorable
fortune
mekin
might
actually
send
ships
to
hunt
the
instead
of
asking
questions
on
kandar
but
bors
made
a
mental
note
the
more
time
that
passed
before
mekin
knew
what
had
happened
the
better
so
a
ship
or
two
or
three
might
be
detached
from
the
fleet
and
sent
back
to
hang
off
kandar
if
a
single
ship
came
inquiringly
it
might
be
sniped
and
the
news
of
kandar
suppressed
for
a
while
longer
and
it
was
conceivable
that
mekin
might
come
to
worry
more
about
other
matters
than
the
success
or
failure
of
a
routine
expansion
of
its
empire
the
fourth
planet
loomed
up
on
schedule
bors
was
irritated
as
often
before
by
the
relatively
slow
drive
overdrive
was
sometimes
not
fast
enough
but
drive
was
infuriatingly
slow
yet
one
could
use
overdrive
in
a
solar
system
approaching
a
planet
on
overdrive
would
be
like
trying
to
garage
a
at
sixty
miles
an
hour
one
could
stop
where
one
wanted
to
he
wondered
vaguely
if
logan
the
math
talent
could
handle
such
a
problem
and
dismissed
the
idea
one
could
break
a
circuit
with
an
accuracy
of
microseconds
but
that
would
be
close
enough
for
overdrive
it
would
be
practical
then
the
of
tralee
nearest
neighbor
planet
spread
out
in
the
range
of
view
bors
called
for
the
it
answered
almost
immediately
it
was
standard
practice
of
course
that
the
site
of
a
meeting
planned
at
a
given
planet
would
be
wherever
its
poles
pointed
nearest
to
galactic
north
the
had
just
arrived
it
barely
responded
before
the
began
to
call
again
the
three
ships
then
joined
their
orbits
and
went
swinging
about
the
beneath
them
while
they
conferred
the
report
from
the
was
unexpectedly
satisfactory
it
had
been
almost
completely
loaded
and
its
cargo
was
largely
foodstuffs
intended
for
mekin
kandar
was
already
subsisting
on
emergency
rations
this
cargo
of
assorted
frozen
foods
would
be
welcome
bors
gave
orders
for
it
to
head
for
glamis
immediately
in
overdrive
communication
had
been
and
gwenlyn
said
quickly
a
moment
did
you
pick
up
any
on
tralee
hm
yes
i
better
send
them
better
echoed
gwenlyn
scolding
father
stayed
with
the
fleet
to
try
to
explain
what
talents
incorporated
can
do
he
kept
most
of
the
talents
with
him
for
demonstrations
the
department
for
predicting
dirty
tricks
is
there
do
you
remember
what
that
department
works
on
of
course
you
got
to
send
those
bors
ordered
a
to
come
from
the
for
the
reports
you
like
to
come
to
dinner
on
the
yacht
asked
gwenlyn
all
living
on
emergency
rations
nobody
asked
us
to
divide
our
supplies
with
the
fleet
i
can
give
you
a
nice
better
not
said
bors
curtly
and
mumbled
thanks
he
ordered
the
to
send
as
much
of
its
stores
as
the
could
conveniently
carry
how
about
some
cigars
asked
gwenlyn
she
seemed
at
once
amused
and
approving
because
bors
would
not
indulge
himself
in
a
really
satisfying
meal
while
his
crew
lived
on
far
from
appetizing
emergency
foodstuffs
no
said
bors
no
cigars
either
you
said
you
had
some
news
for
me
what
is
it
brought
along
our
said
gwenlyn
blandly
can
only
tell
when
a
ship
will
arrive
at
the
solar
system
where
he
is
so
he
had
to
come
here
to
bors
felt
again
that
stubborn
incredulity
which
talents
incorporated
would
always
rouse
in
a
mind
like
his
be
a
ship
arriving
here
in
two
days
four
hours
sixteen
minutes
from
said
gwenlyn
thinks
it
a
fighting
ship
though
he
ca
be
sure
it
could
be
a
cruiser
or
something
like
that
doing
mail
duty
coming
to
deliver
orders
and
receive
reports
you
ca
run
an
empire
without
a
regular
news
system
and
mekin
would
depend
on
commercial
ships
for
government
good
said
bors
thanks
there
was
a
pause
will
you
do
now
try
to
raise
the
devil
somewhere
else
said
bors
try
to
pick
up
another
probably
maybe
i
ought
to
let
this
ship
alone
to
carry
news
of
the
pirate
ship
back
to
mekin
but
no
they
use
as
police
devices
it
was
not
reasonable
but
bors
could
not
think
of
missing
a
mekinese
warship
the
idea
of
a
government
using
to
enforce
its
orders
somehow
put
it
beyond
forgiveness
and
with
the
government
all
those
who
served
it
willingly
go
to
garen
then
asked
gwenlyn
bors
felt
a
sharp
sting
of
annoyance
he
had
carefully
kept
secret
the
choice
of
garen
three
as
the
next
planet
to
be
invaded
by
the
ship
it
was
upsetting
to
find
that
gwenlyn
knew
about
it
blast
talents
incorporated
dowsing
said
gwenlyn
there
a
battleship
aground
there
there
been
some
riots
the
people
of
garen
do
like
mekin
either
strange
the
battleship
is
to
overawe
how
do
you
know
that
demanded
bors
department
for
predicting
dirty
tricks
was
reading
old
she
told
him
leaving
now
goodbye
said
bors
and
sighed
not
knowing
whether
he
felt
regret
or
relief
the
flicked
out
of
sight
it
had
gone
into
overdrive
bors
realized
that
he
had
noticed
which
way
it
pointed
he
should
have
taken
note
but
he
shook
his
head
he
gave
the
detailed
orders
receiving
its
and
what
food
it
had
been
able
to
bring
he
sent
it
off
to
meet
his
fleet
at
glamis
he
stayed
in
orbit
around
the
fourth
planet
to
wait
for
a
mekinese
he
began
too
to
make
plans
chapter
the
mekinese
ship
was
a
cruiser
and
it
broke
out
of
overdrive
within
the
tralee
solar
system
just
two
days
four
hours
and
some
odd
minutes
after
gwenlyn
predicted
its
coming
presumably
it
had
made
the
customary
earlier
breakout
to
correct
its
course
and
measure
the
distance
remaining
to
be
run
in
overdrive
there
was
not
as
yet
a
way
to
know
accurately
one
actual
speed
and
at
astronomical
distances
small
errors
piled
up
correction
of
line
was
important
too
because
a
course
that
was
even
a
second
off
arc
could
mount
up
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miles
but
even
with
that
usual
previous
breakout
the
mekinese
cruiser
did
not
turn
up
conveniently
close
to
its
destination
it
needed
a
long
drive
to
make
its
planetfall
bors
radar
picked
it
up
before
it
was
near
enough
to
notify
its
arrival
to
the
planet
if
it
intended
to
notify
at
all
most
likely
its
program
was
simply
and
frighteningly
to
appear
overhead
and
arrogantly
demand
the
services
of
the
to
lower
it
to
the
ground
bors
radar
detected
the
cruiser
and
instantly
cut
itself
off
the
cry
of
went
through
the
ship
and
all
inner
doors
closed
sealing
the
ship
into
sections
bors
was
already
at
the
board
in
the
control
room
he
did
not
accept
the
predictions
of
talents
incorporated
as
absolute
truth
it
bothered
him
that
such
irrational
means
of
securing
information
should
be
so
accurate
so
he
compromised
in
his
own
mind
to
the
point
where
when
talents
incorporated
gave
specific
information
it
was
possible
no
more
then
having
admitted
so
much
he
acted
on
the
mere
possibility
and
pretended
to
be
surprised
when
it
turned
out
to
be
a
fact
that
was
the
case
now
a
ship
had
appeared
in
this
solar
system
at
the
time
the
talent
on
the
predicted
bors
scowled
and
swung
the
in
line
between
tralee
and
the
new
arrival
he
turned
then
and
drove
steadily
out
toward
it
the
other
ship
screens
would
show
a
large
blip
which
was
the
planet
and
in
direct
line
a
very
much
smaller
blip
which
was
the
the
small
blip
might
not
be
noticed
because
it
was
in
line
with
the
larger
if
it
were
noticed
it
would
be
confusing
because
such
things
should
not
happen
but
the
cruisers
of
mekin
were
not
apt
to
be
easily
alarmed
they
represented
a
great
empire
all
of
whose
were
safely
controlled
and
though
there
was
disaffection
everywhere
there
was
no
reason
to
suspect
rebellion
at
operations
in
space
for
a
long
time
nothing
happened
the
drove
to
meet
the
cruiser
the
two
vessels
should
be
approaching
each
other
at
a
rate
which
was
the
total
of
their
speeds
bors
punched
and
got
the
gravitational
factor
at
this
distance
from
tralee
sun
he
set
the
drive
to
that
exact
quantity
he
waited
his
own
radar
was
now
its
first
would
have
been
observed
by
the
mekinese
the
fact
that
it
did
not
repeat
would
be
abnormal
the
would
wonder
why
it
did
come
again
the
cut
off
then
a
single
strong
pulse
came
it
would
be
a
radars
sacrificed
high
accuracy
for
wide
and
deep
coverage
but
carried
pulse
instruments
which
could
measure
distances
within
feet
up
to
thousands
of
miles
and
by
among
the
echoes
even
get
some
information
about
the
size
and
shape
of
the
object
examined
not
much
but
some
bors
relaxed
things
were
going
well
when
four
other
arrived
at
second
intervals
he
nodded
to
himself
this
was
a
reaction
it
could
be
nothing
else
that
officer
knew
that
something
was
coming
out
from
tralee
it
was
on
approximately
a
collision
course
but
a
ship
traveling
under
power
should
gain
velocity
as
long
as
its
drive
was
on
when
traveling
outward
from
the
sun
and
not
under
power
it
should
lose
velocity
by
so
many
feet
per
second
to
the
gravitational
pull
bors
ship
did
neither
it
displayed
the
remarkably
unlikely
characteristic
of
absolutely
steady
motion
it
was
not
normal
it
was
not
possible
it
could
not
have
any
reasonable
explanation
in
the
mind
of
a
mekinese
which
was
its
purpose
it
would
arouse
professional
curiosity
on
the
cruiser
which
would
then
waste
some
precious
time
attempting
to
identify
it
there
would
be
suspicion
because
it
did
act
suspiciously
still
it
could
be
dismissed
because
it
did
behave
in
any
recognizable
fashion
the
cruiser
would
want
to
know
more
about
it
it
should
move
at
a
steady
velocity
going
outward
from
a
sun
in
consequence
bors
got
in
the
first
shot
he
said
fire
one
when
the
mekinese
would
be
just
about
planning
to
turn
their
upon
it
a
missile
leaped
away
from
the
it
went
off
at
an
angle
and
it
curved
madly
and
the
instrumentation
of
the
cruiser
could
spot
it
as
now
there
now
here
now
nearer
and
now
nearer
still
but
the
computers
could
not
handle
an
object
which
not
only
changed
velocity
but
changed
the
rate
at
which
its
velocity
changed
missiles
came
pouring
out
of
the
mekinese
ship
they
were
infinitesimal
bright
specks
on
the
they
curved
violently
in
flight
trying
to
intercept
the
missile
they
failed
there
was
a
flash
of
flame
very
very
far
away
there
was
a
little
cloud
of
vapor
which
dissipated
swiftly
then
there
was
nothing
but
two
or
three
specks
moving
at
random
their
target
lost
their
purpose
forgotten
the
fact
of
victory
was
an
anticlimax
all
clear
said
bors
grimly
the
doors
opened
the
normal
sounds
of
the
ship
were
heard
again
bors
began
to
calculate
the
data
needed
for
the
journey
to
garen
there
was
the
angle
and
the
distance
and
the
proper
motions
and
the
time
elapsed
he
found
it
difficult
to
think
in
such
terms
he
was
discontented
he
ambushed
a
mekinese
cruiser
true
he
let
his
own
ship
be
seen
and
the
mekinese
had
warning
enough
to
launch
missiles
in
their
own
defense
it
was
not
even
faintly
like
the
ambush
of
a
cruiser
on
the
bottom
of
a
kandarian
sea
waiting
to
assassinate
a
fleet
when
its
complement
went
on
board
but
bors
did
like
what
he
just
done
the
figures
would
come
out
right
impatiently
he
sent
for
logan
the
mathematical
talent
came
into
the
control
room
will
you
calculate
this
for
me
bors
asked
irritably
logan
glanced
casually
at
the
figures
and
wrote
down
the
answer
instantly
without
thought
or
reflection
instantly
bors
could
quite
believe
it
the
distance
between
the
two
stars
was
a
number
of
course
the
relative
proper
motion
of
the
two
stars
had
a
large
bugger
factor
the
due
to
distance
had
a
presumed
correction
and
there
was
a
considerable
probable
error
in
the
speed
of
translation
of
the
ship
during
overdrive
it
was
a
moderately
complicated
equation
and
the
computation
of
the
probable
error
was
especially
tricky
bors
stared
at
it
and
then
stared
at
logan
that
the
answer
to
what
you
have
written
there
said
logan
condescendingly
but
your
figures
are
off
i
been
talking
to
your
computer
men
they
given
me
the
log
figures
on
past
overdrive
jumps
and
the
observed
errors
on
arrival
they
systematic
i
noticed
it
at
once
bors
said
what
there
a
source
of
consistent
error
logan
said
patiently
i
found
the
values
to
correct
it
then
i
found
the
source
it
in
your
overdrive
speed
bors
blinked
speed
in
overdrive
could
not
be
computed
exactly
the
approximation
was
very
close
within
a
fraction
of
a
tenth
of
one
per
cent
but
when
the
distance
traveled
was
the
uncertainty
piled
up
if
you
use
these
figures
said
logan
complacently
and
he
scribbled
figures
swiftly
you
get
it
really
accurate
having
finished
writing
the
equation
he
wrote
the
solution
bors
asked
suspicious
questions
logan
answered
absently
he
knew
nothing
about
overdrive
he
did
understand
anything
but
numbers
and
he
did
know
how
he
did
what
he
did
with
them
but
he
worked
backward
from
observed
errors
in
calculation
and
found
a
way
to
keep
them
out
of
the
answer
and
he
done
it
all
in
his
head
it
was
unbelievable
yet
bors
believed
i
try
your
figures
he
said
thanks
logan
went
proudly
away
past
an
orderly
bringing
cups
of
coffee
to
the
control
room
bors
aimed
the
ship
according
to
the
calculation
logan
had
given
him
scrupulously
setting
the
breakout
timer
to
the
exact
figure
listed
he
was
still
uncomfortable
about
the
destruction
of
the
mekinese
cruiser
when
he
said
curtly
overdrive
coming
he
have
preferred
a
more
sportsmanlike
type
of
warfare
he
faced
the
old
deplorable
fact
that
fighting
men
had
had
to
adjust
to
throughout
the
ages
one
can
fight
an
honorable
enemy
honorably
but
against
some
men
scruples
count
as
handicaps
swine
growled
bors
they
make
us
like
them
then
into
the
microphone
he
said
five
four
three
two
one
he
pressed
the
overdrive
button
the
sensation
of
going
into
overdrive
was
acutely
uncomfortable
as
always
bors
swallowed
squeamishly
and
took
his
cup
of
coffee
the
then
lay
wrapped
in
a
cocoon
of
stressed
space
its
properties
included
the
fact
that
its
particular
type
of
stress
could
travel
much
more
swiftly
than
the
stresses
involved
in
the
propagation
of
radiation
of
magnetism
or
gravity
and
this
state
of
stress
this
overdrive
field
did
not
have
a
position
it
a
position
the
ship
inside
it
could
not
be
said
to
be
in
the
real
cosmos
at
all
but
when
the
field
collapsed
it
would
be
somewhere
and
the
way
it
pointed
and
how
long
before
collapse
determined
in
what
particular
somewhere
it
would
be
when
it
came
out
but
travel
in
overdrive
was
tedious
as
civilization
increases
man
control
of
the
cosmos
it
takes
the
fun
out
of
it
in
prehistoric
days
a
man
who
had
to
hunt
animals
or
go
hungry
may
often
have
gone
hungry
but
he
was
never
bored
by
the
sameness
of
his
meals
a
man
who
traveled
on
horseback
often
got
to
his
destination
late
but
he
was
not
troubled
with
ennui
on
the
way
in
overdrive
bors
ship
traveled
almost
with
the
speed
of
thought
but
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
think
about
while
journeying
not
about
the
journey
anyhow
while
the
ship
drove
on
however
the
seized
on
tralee
made
its
way
toward
glamis
and
a
meeting
with
the
fleet
then
gloomily
sweeping
in
orbit
around
glamis
two
the
food
it
carried
would
raise
men
spirits
a
little
but
it
would
not
solve
the
problem
of
what
the
fleet
was
to
do
morgan
on
the
flagship
expounded
the
ability
of
his
talents
to
perform
the
incredible
but
nobody
could
find
any
application
of
the
incredible
to
the
fix
the
fleet
was
in
on
kandar
the
population
knew
that
there
had
been
a
battle
off
the
planet
but
they
did
not
know
the
result
the
mekinese
fleet
had
not
come
the
fleet
of
kandar
had
not
returned
the
caretaker
government
met
in
council
and
desperately
made
guesses
it
arrived
at
no
hopeful
conclusion
whatever
the
most
probable
because
most
hopeless
conviction
seemed
to
be
that
the
fleet
of
mekin
had
been
met
and
fought
but
that
it
was
victorious
and
in
retaliation
for
resistance
it
had
gone
away
to
send
back
swarms
of
grisly
which
would
drop
atomic
bombs
in
such
quantity
that
for
a
thousand
years
to
come
there
would
be
no
life
on
kandar
the
light
cruiser
the
was
unaware
of
these
frustrations
it
remained
in
overdrive
where
absolutely
nothing
happened
bors
reviewed
his
actions
and
could
not
but
approve
of
them
tepidly
he
sent
food
to
the
fleet
he
destroyed
two
enemy
fighting
ships
and
he
done
what
he
could
to
harm
the
mekinese
puppets
on
tralee
he
had
them
publicly
humiliated
with
epithets
he
destroyed
the
records
and
archives
of
the
secret
political
police
many
people
on
tralee
already
blessed
him
without
knowing
who
he
was
there
might
yet
be
hope
of
better
days
but
all
things
end
even
journeys
at
excessively
great
multiples
of
the
speed
of
light
the
overdrive
timer
rang
warning
bells
taped
breakout
notifications
sounded
from
speakers
throughout
the
ship
there
was
a
of
seconds
and
the
abominably
unpleasant
sensation
of
breakout
and
the
ship
was
in
normal
space
again
there
was
the
sun
of
garen
burning
peacefully
in
a
vast
void
with
millions
of
minute
unwinking
lights
in
the
firmament
all
about
it
there
was
a
planet
a
mere
fifteen
million
miles
away
further
out
there
were
the
smaller
frozen
worlds
nearer
the
sun
on
the
far
side
of
its
orbit
there
was
the
planet
garen
the
drove
for
that
planet
while
bors
tried
to
decide
whether
the
remarkable
accuracy
of
this
breakout
was
due
to
accident
or
to
computations
logan
appeared
as
bors
was
gloomily
contemplating
the
days
needed
to
reach
garen
on
solar
system
drive
because
overdrive
was
too
fast
logan
looked
offhand
and
elaborately
casual
but
he
fairly
glowed
with
triumph
i
found
out
the
fact
behind
the
bugger
factor
captain
he
said
condescendingly
the
speed
of
a
ship
in
overdrive
varies
as
the
change
in
mass
to
the
minus
fourth
your
computers
could
tell
that
here
a
table
for
calculating
the
speed
of
a
ship
in
overdrive
according
to
its
mass
and
the
strength
of
the
overdrive
field
fine
said
bors
without
enthusiasm
and
to
go
with
it
said
logan
his
voice
indifferent
but
his
eyes
shining
proudly
just
for
my
own
amusement
i
computed
a
complete
table
of
overdrive
speeds
for
this
particular
ship
with
different
strengths
of
field
they
run
from
one
point
five
up
to
the
maximum
your
equipment
will
give
you
have
to
correct
for
changes
of
mass
of
course
bors
was
not
quite
capable
of
enthusiasm
over
the
computation
of
tables
of
complex
figures
he
simply
could
not
share
logan
thrill
of
achievement
in
the
results
of
the
neat
rows
of
numerals
nor
had
he
struggled
unduly
to
grasp
the
implication
of
logan
explanation
instead
he
said
politely
very
nice
thank
you
very
much
logan
eyes
ceased
to
shine
his
wounded
pride
made
him
defiant
nobody
else
anywhere
could
have
worked
out
that
table
he
said
stridently
nobody
morgan
said
you
appreciate
my
work
he
said
you
needed
my
talent
but
what
good
do
you
see
in
it
you
think
i
a
freak
bors
realized
that
he
been
tactless
logan
experiences
before
talents
incorporated
had
made
him
unduly
sensitive
he
done
something
of
which
he
was
proud
but
bors
did
appreciate
its
magnitude
logan
reacted
to
the
frustration
of
his
vanity
hold
it
said
bors
i
not
unappreciative
i
stupid
and
worried
about
something
you
just
figured
an
overdrive
jump
for
me
that
the
most
accurate
i
ever
heard
of
but
i
desperate
for
time
and
we
got
to
spend
two
days
in
drive
because
we
ca
make
an
overdrive
hop
of
less
than
so
we
losing
hours
or
more
logan
said
as
stridently
as
before
but
i
just
showed
you
you
do
have
to
cut
the
according
to
that
table
bors
was
jolted
it
was
suddenly
logan
had
said
figured
a
table
of
overdrive
fields
for
the
which
would
work
for
anything
between
one
point
five
to
maximum
one
point
five
it
was
one
of
those
absurdities
in
technology
that
so
often
go
so
long
before
they
are
noticed
during
the
development
of
overdrive
it
had
been
the
effort
of
every
technician
to
get
the
fastest
possible
drive
it
was
known
that
with
a
given
mass
and
a
given
one
could
get
an
effective
speed
of
an
unbelievable
figure
men
had
spent
their
lives
trying
to
increase
that
figure
but
nobody
ever
tried
to
find
out
how
one
could
travel
in
overdrive
because
drive
took
care
of
distances
wait
a
minute
said
bors
staring
do
you
really
mean
i
can
drive
this
ship
under
two
in
overdrive
look
at
the
table
said
logan
trembling
with
anger
look
at
it
you
find
the
figures
right
there
bors
looked
then
he
stood
up
quickly
he
left
the
ship
in
the
care
of
his
and
plunged
into
a
highly
technical
discussion
with
its
engineers
he
ran
into
violent
objections
the
whole
purpose
of
overdrive
was
high
speed
between
stars
the
engineers
insisted
that
one
had
to
use
the
strongest
possible
field
if
the
field
were
made
feeble
it
would
become
unstable
everybody
knew
that
the
field
had
to
be
of
maximum
strength
we
try
minimum
said
bors
coldly
now
let
get
to
work
he
had
to
do
much
of
the
labor
himself
because
the
engineers
found
it
necessary
to
stop
at
each
stage
of
the
effort
to
explain
why
it
should
not
be
done
he
had
almost
to
battle
to
get
an
auxiliary
circuit
paralleling
the
main
overdrive
unit
with
a
transformer
to
bring
down
voltage
and
a
complete
new
unit
to
be
cut
into
the
overdrive
line
while
leaving
the
standard
ready
for
use
without
delay
he
went
back
to
the
control
room
he
took
a
on
the
huge
planet
off
to
port
he
threw
on
the
new
overdrive
field
he
held
it
for
seconds
and
broke
out
it
was
still
in
sight
the
speed
of
the
with
the
adjusted
overdrive
was
one
point
seven
lights
now
instead
of
spending
days
in
drive
for
planetary
approach
bors
went
into
the
drive
and
broke
out
in
eleven
minutes
twenty
seconds
and
was
within
a
hundred
thousand
miles
of
garen
he
saved
two
days
and
secured
the
promise
of
many
more
such
valuable
feats
as
soon
as
the
broke
to
normal
space
near
garen
there
was
a
call
on
the
communicator
a
familiar
voice
isis
isis
sylva
isis
bors
said
softly
damnation
for
the
second
time
what
are
you
doing
in
this
place
gwenlyn
voice
laughed
for
pleasure
captain
bors
i
news
for
you
we
were
allowed
to
land
and
then
told
to
leave
again
there
a
warship
down
below
i
told
you
about
it
before
it
still
there
there
a
huge
too
and
there
are
riots
because
it
almost
finished
loading
with
requisitioned
foodstuffs
for
mekin
mekin
is
would
you
believe
it
unpopular
on
garen
very
well
said
bors
i
see
what
can
be
done
will
you
carry
a
message
for
me
to
oblige
captain
tell
them
that
then
bors
stopped
short
it
was
not
probable
that
the
fleet
and
frequency
were
known
to
mekinese
ships
but
the
possibility
of
overdrive
travel
was
much
too
important
a
military
secret
to
risk
under
any
circumstances
he
said
i
be
along
very
shortly
with
some
highly
encouraging
news
do
i
tell
this
to
i
name
no
names
on
microwaves
he
told
her
get
going
will
you
said
gwenlyn
cheerfully
to
her
communicator
clicked
off
the
showed
on
a
but
had
not
been
near
enough
to
be
sighted
direct
the
blip
shot
out
from
the
planet
bors
growled
to
himself
the
floated
a
hundred
thousand
miles
off
garen
there
was
no
challenge
there
was
no
query
from
the
planet
but
gwenlyn
said
that
there
were
riots
down
below
they
could
be
serious
enough
to
absorb
the
attention
usually
given
to
routine
but
there
was
another
reason
for
this
inattention
garen
was
a
part
of
the
mekinese
empire
which
was
not
encouraged
to
trade
except
through
mekin
very
few
ships
would
ever
land
there
and
therefore
would
be
watched
for
it
was
unlikely
that
a
radar
habitually
swept
space
off
garen
the
battleship
should
be
more
alert
but
again
there
was
no
danger
of
rebellion
and
the
affair
of
kandar
might
not
have
been
bruited
so
far
away
but
the
spaceport
would
respond
to
calls
certainly
bors
considered
these
circumstances
a
large
loaded
with
foodstuffs
requisitioned
to
be
sent
to
mekin
a
population
which
had
been
rebellious
before
witness
the
battleship
aground
to
overawe
resistance
and
now
was
rioting
bors
called
for
the
extra
members
of
his
crew
he
uncomfortably
outlined
the
action
he
had
in
mind
there
was
one
part
that
he
disliked
he
had
to
stay
on
board
ship
the
important
action
as
he
saw
it
would
take
place
elsewhere
it
was
so
obviously
painful
for
him
to
outline
a
course
of
action
in
which
other
men
must
take
risks
he
could
share
that
his
men
regarded
him
with
pleased
affection
which
he
did
not
guess
at
in
the
end
he
asked
for
twenty
volunteers
and
got
fifty
he
swung
the
around
to
the
night
side
of
the
planet
its
two
port
blisters
opened
and
two
boats
floated
free
in
the
orbit
bors
had
established
the
ship
moved
on
ahead
just
at
sunup
where
the
spaceport
stood
a
voice
growled
down
from
outer
space
ground
it
said
contemptuously
ground
this
is
the
last
ship
left
of
the
fleet
of
kandar
we
pirates
now
and
looking
for
trouble
there
a
battleship
down
there
come
up
and
fight
or
we
blast
you
in
your
spaceport
just
to
prove
we
can
do
it
watch
bors
said
fire
one
and
a
missile
went
off
toward
the
planet
it
was
fused
to
detonate
at
the
very
tip
of
the
fringes
of
the
atmosphere
it
did
there
was
light
more
brilliant
than
a
thousand
suns
the
long
low
shadows
of
sunrise
vanished
the
sun
turned
dim
by
comparison
the
voice
from
space
spoke
with
intolerable
levity
up
with
your
missiles
ready
we
give
you
ten
thousand
miles
of
height
and
if
you
try
to
duck
out
in
overdrive
the
voice
was
explicit
about
what
it
would
do
to
the
areas
of
garen
if
the
battleship
fled
it
came
up
to
fight
it
could
do
nothing
else
chapter
the
trick
of
course
was
in
the
timing
and
the
secret
was
that
bors
knew
what
he
was
doing
while
those
who
opposed
him
did
not
bors
had
declared
himself
a
pirate
on
tralee
and
here
off
garen
he
claimed
the
same
status
but
no
mekinese
as
yet
knew
why
he
outlawed
himself
nor
his
purpose
in
challenging
a
line
battleship
to
fight
it
seemed
like
the
raving
hysterical
hatred
of
men
with
no
motive
but
hate
but
it
was
the
could
have
sent
down
a
missile
with
a
warhead
if
its
only
purpose
had
been
to
kill
or
to
destroy
he
could
have
blasted
the
warship
without
warning
and
it
was
unlikely
that
it
was
alert
enough
to
send
up
in
its
own
defense
but
he
have
had
to
smash
everything
else
in
the
spaceport
at
the
same
time
therefore
he
left
his
two
in
low
orbit
on
the
night
side
of
the
planet
in
thirty
minutes
or
so
they
arrive
near
the
spaceport
where
there
was
a
large
loaded
with
foodstuffs
for
mekin
bors
wanted
that
cargo
so
when
the
mekinese
battlewagon
came
lumbering
up
to
space
with
her
armed
and
bristling
bors
withdrew
the
it
was
not
flight
it
was
a
move
designed
to
make
sure
that
when
the
fight
began
there
would
be
no
stray
missiles
falling
on
the
planet
unseen
the
floated
in
darkness
they
carried
ten
men
each
equipped
with
small
arms
and
light
bombs
they
listened
to
such
bits
of
broadcast
information
as
came
from
the
night
beneath
them
boat
number
one
picked
up
a
news
broadcast
and
when
it
was
finished
the
petty
officer
in
command
pulled
free
the
tape
that
had
recorded
it
and
tucked
it
in
his
pocket
there
were
items
of
interest
on
it
the
came
to
a
stop
in
space
the
battleship
rose
and
rose
it
did
not
drive
toward
the
there
was
a
maximum
distance
beyond
which
was
impractical
beyond
which
missiles
became
mere
blind
projectiles
moving
almost
at
random
and
destroying
each
other
without
regard
to
planetary
loyalties
there
was
also
a
minimum
distance
below
which
missiles
were
again
mere
projectiles
and
could
not
greatly
modify
the
courses
on
which
they
were
launched
but
there
was
a
wide
area
in
between
in
which
combat
was
practical
the
mekinese
battleship
reached
a
height
where
it
could
maneuver
on
drive
without
rockets
it
might
of
course
flick
into
overdrive
and
be
gone
thousands
of
millions
of
miles
within
seconds
but
that
would
be
flight
it
would
not
return
accurately
to
the
scene
of
the
fight
so
overdrive
could
not
be
used
as
a
battle
tactic
it
could
be
used
only
for
escape
near
the
planet
where
the
two
floated
the
dawnline
appeared
at
the
world
edge
the
swung
about
facing
backward
and
applied
power
for
deceleration
they
dropped
into
the
atmosphere
and
bounced
out
again
and
in
again
more
deeply
and
then
swung
once
more
to
face
along
their
course
they
began
a
long
shallow
screaming
descent
from
the
farthest
limits
of
the
planet
atmosphere
out
where
the
sun
of
garen
was
a
disk
of
intolerable
brilliance
and
heat
the
battleship
bumbled
on
its
way
it
would
seem
that
its
commander
scornfully
accepted
the
terms
of
combat
and
moved
contemptuously
to
the
position
where
his
weapons
would
be
most
deadly
his
ship
were
at
the
ready
it
should
be
able
to
pour
out
a
cloud
of
missiles
in
fact
a
sardonic
voice
came
from
the
battleship
said
the
voice
yes
said
bors
you
wish
to
surrender
we
do
said
bors
was
about
to
said
the
sardonic
voice
it
is
now
too
the
showed
tiny
specks
darting
out
from
that
larger
speck
which
was
the
battleship
they
came
hurtling
toward
the
bors
counted
them
a
ship
of
the
class
mounted
eighteen
she
should
be
able
to
fire
eighteen
missiles
at
a
time
the
mekinese
ship
had
fired
nineteen
if
the
opened
fire
by
all
the
previous
rules
of
she
would
need
to
use
one
missile
to
counter
every
one
of
the
battleship
there
would
still
be
one
left
over
to
destroy
the
unless
she
fired
a
second
spread
of
missiles
which
was
virtually
impossible
before
she
would
be
hit
it
was
mockery
by
the
skipper
of
the
battleship
he
was
doubtless
much
amused
at
the
idea
of
toying
with
this
small
insolent
vessel
but
bors
did
not
try
to
match
him
missile
for
missile
he
said
evenly
fire
one
fire
two
fire
three
fire
four
he
stopped
at
four
his
four
missiles
went
curving
wildly
in
the
general
direction
only
of
the
enemy
on
the
planet
garen
two
shrieking
objects
came
furiously
to
ground
men
leaped
swiftly
out
of
them
and
trotted
toward
a
small
town
a
settlement
a
group
of
houses
hardly
larger
than
a
village
one
man
delayed
by
each
grounded
and
then
ran
to
overtake
the
others
local
inhabitants
appeared
to
stare
and
to
wonder
the
two
ten
men
in
each
did
not
pause
they
swarmed
into
the
village
single
street
there
were
at
the
the
men
of
the
established
themselves
briskly
one
of
them
seized
a
staring
civilian
by
the
arm
to
hell
with
mekin
he
said
conversationally
where
the
communicator
office
wha
what
to
hell
with
mekin
repeated
the
man
from
the
impatiently
where
the
communicator
office
the
civilian
trembling
suddenly
pointed
some
of
the
rushed
to
it
four
went
in
there
were
the
reports
of
smoke
and
the
smell
of
burnt
insulation
drifted
out
others
of
the
magically
arrived
men
went
methodically
down
the
street
examining
each
in
turn
one
of
them
cupped
his
hands
and
bellowed
for
the
information
of
alarmed
citizens
attention
please
we
from
the
pirate
ship
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
us
we
survivors
of
mekin
invasion
of
kandar
you
will
please
with
us
and
no
harm
will
come
to
you
your
will
be
disabled
so
you
ca
report
us
you
will
not
be
punished
for
this
repeat
you
will
not
be
punished
he
repeated
the
announcement
others
of
the
drove
the
chosen
away
from
the
streets
the
remaining
cars
received
a
apiece
in
seven
minutes
and
thirty
seconds
from
the
landing
of
the
small
a
motley
assortment
of
cars
roared
out
of
the
village
heading
for
the
capital
city
of
garen
as
the
last
car
cleared
the
houses
there
was
a
monstrous
explosion
one
of
the
flew
to
bits
before
the
cars
had
vanished
there
was
a
second
explosion
another
vanished
in
flame
and
debris
the
had
no
way
to
return
to
space
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
had
no
way
to
report
their
coming
except
in
person
and
by
traveling
some
considerable
distance
on
foot
they
were
singularly
slow
in
making
that
report
the
men
of
the
had
said
they
were
pirates
the
people
of
garen
felt
no
animosity
toward
pirates
they
only
hated
mekinese
out
in
space
missiles
hurtled
away
from
the
small
ship
they
did
not
plunge
directly
at
the
battleship
they
swung
crazily
in
wide
arcs
the
mekinese
missiles
swerved
to
intercept
them
they
failed
more
missiles
erupted
from
the
battleship
aimed
to
intercept
they
also
failed
the
battleship
began
to
fling
out
every
missile
it
possessed
in
a
frantic
effort
to
knock
out
the
erratic
missiles
which
neither
instruments
nor
eyes
were
able
to
follow
accurately
enough
to
establish
a
pattern
of
destination
half
a
dozen
roared
through
the
streets
of
the
capital
city
of
garen
they
did
not
seem
to
be
crowded
one
man
or
at
most
two
could
be
seen
in
each
car
but
they
drove
as
a
unit
one
close
behind
another
at
a
furious
pace
when
they
needed
a
clear
way
the
first
sounded
its
and
the
others
joined
in
as
a
chorus
half
a
dozen
sirens
blaring
together
have
an
authoritative
emergency
sound
the
way
was
cleared
when
that
imperative
clarion
demanded
it
they
swerved
under
the
they
raced
and
bounced
across
the
clear
surface
which
was
the
spaceport
there
stood
a
giant
rotund
pointing
skyward
there
were
still
supplying
cargo
for
its
nearly
holds
the
six
braked
making
clouds
of
dust
and
suddenly
there
was
not
one
or
two
men
in
each
but
an
astonishing
number
they
knew
exactly
what
they
were
about
five
of
them
plunged
into
the
ship
others
drove
off
the
uniformed
men
ran
from
the
side
of
the
spaceport
toward
the
ship
yelling
one
started
up
again
rushed
to
the
swerved
sharply
as
a
crash
into
it
seemed
inevitable
and
dumped
something
out
on
the
ground
it
raced
back
to
the
other
cars
about
the
the
were
closing
the
object
dumped
by
the
went
off
it
was
a
bomb
but
its
power
was
adequate
the
wall
of
the
building
caved
in
flames
leaped
crazily
out
of
the
collapsed
heap
the
would
be
out
of
operation
the
last
car
skidded
to
a
stop
the
two
men
in
it
ran
for
the
of
the
there
was
nobody
of
their
party
outside
now
the
withdrew
after
them
then
monstrous
incredible
masses
of
flame
and
steam
burst
from
the
bottom
of
the
rotund
it
lifted
slowly
at
first
but
then
more
and
more
swiftly
it
climbed
to
the
sky
it
became
a
speck
and
then
a
mote
at
the
crawling
end
of
a
trail
of
opaque
white
fumes
then
it
vanished
far
out
in
space
there
was
an
explosion
brighter
than
the
sun
and
then
a
second
and
a
third
there
was
a
cloud
of
incandescent
metal
vapor
presently
a
missile
found
its
microwaves
reflected
by
the
ionized
metal
steam
it
plunged
into
collision
with
that
glowing
stuff
it
exploded
two
or
three
more
exploded
like
the
first
others
burned
harmlessly
a
voice
said
reporting
clear
of
ground
everything
going
well
no
report
again
when
in
clear
space
said
bors
he
waited
several
long
minutes
later
a
second
report
came
reporting
in
clear
very
good
work
said
bors
you
know
where
to
go
now
go
ahead
said
the
voice
from
space
then
it
asked
apologetically
got
the
battleship
sir
the
voice
from
space
sounded
as
if
the
man
who
spoke
were
grinning
celebrate
that
sir
good
to
have
served
with
you
bors
swung
the
and
drove
on
drive
to
get
well
away
from
garen
he
watched
the
blip
which
was
the
captured
ship
as
it
seemed
to
hesitate
a
very
very
long
time
it
was
aiming
of
course
for
glamis
that
totally
useless
solar
system
around
a
planet
where
the
fleet
of
kandar
orbited
in
bitter
frustration
bors
got
up
from
his
seat
to
loosen
his
muscles
he
had
sat
absolutely
tense
and
effectively
motionless
for
a
very
long
time
he
ached
but
he
felt
a
sour
sort
of
satisfaction
for
a
ship
of
the
class
to
have
challenged
a
battleship
to
combat
to
have
deliberately
and
insultingly
waited
for
it
to
choose
its
own
and
then
to
let
it
launch
its
missiles
first
it
was
no
ambush
bors
did
not
feel
ashamed
of
this
fight
he
acted
according
to
the
instincts
of
a
fighting
man
who
gives
his
enemy
the
chance
to
use
what
weapons
the
enemy
has
chosen
and
then
defeats
him
his
said
sir
the
blip
is
gone
it
should
be
in
overdrive
now
sir
heading
for
glamis
then
we
follow
it
said
bors
suddenly
he
realized
how
his
must
feel
the
seen
action
for
which
bors
envied
them
and
he
felt
ashamed
because
he
stayed
in
the
ship
in
what
he
considered
safety
while
they
risked
their
lives
but
his
had
had
no
share
in
the
achievement
at
all
bors
had
handled
all
controls
and
given
all
orders
even
the
routine
ones
since
before
tralee
i
think
said
bors
i
have
a
cup
of
coffee
will
you
take
over
and
head
for
glamis
he
left
the
to
let
his
subordinate
handle
things
for
a
time
he
seated
himself
in
the
when
the
voice
of
his
came
through
the
speakers
into
said
the
voice
steady
five
four
three
two
bors
prepared
to
wince
he
put
down
his
coffee
cup
and
held
himself
ready
for
the
sickening
sensation
suddenly
there
was
the
rasping
snaring
crackling
of
a
spark
there
were
shouts
there
were
explosions
and
the
reek
of
overheated
metal
and
smoldering
insulation
then
the
closed
when
bors
had
examined
the
damage
and
the
had
taken
the
smoke
and
smell
out
of
the
air
his
looked
suicidally
gloomy
it
bad
business
said
bors
wryly
very
bad
business
but
i
should
have
mentioned
it
to
you
i
did
think
of
it
i
would
have
thought
of
it
if
i
been
doing
the
overdrive
business
myself
the
said
bitterly
but
i
knew
you
tried
the
new
overdrive
i
knew
it
i
left
it
switched
in
said
bors
because
i
thought
we
might
use
it
in
the
fight
with
the
battleship
but
we
did
i
should
have
checked
that
it
was
off
protested
his
second
it
my
fault
bors
shrugged
deciding
whose
fault
it
was
would
repair
the
damage
there
been
a
human
error
bors
had
approached
garen
on
the
overdrive
that
logan
had
computed
for
him
there
was
a
special
switch
to
cut
it
in
instead
of
the
standard
overdrive
it
should
have
been
cut
out
when
the
standard
overdrive
was
used
but
somebody
in
the
had
simply
thrown
the
switch
when
preparations
for
overdrive
travel
began
when
the
ship
should
have
gone
into
overdrive
it
did
the
two
parallel
circuits
amounted
to
an
effective
generators
condensers
even
the
overdrive
field
coils
in
their
armored
mounts
outside
the
hull
everything
blew
so
the
was
left
with
a
drive
and
rockets
and
nothing
else
if
the
drive
used
only
in
solar
systems
were
put
on
full
and
the
headed
for
glamis
and
if
the
food
and
water
held
out
it
would
arrive
at
that
distant
world
in
years
it
could
reach
tralee
in
fifty
but
there
were
emergency
rations
for
a
few
weeks
only
it
was
not
conceivable
that
repairs
could
be
made
this
was
no
occasion
calling
for
remarkable
ingenuity
to
make
some
sort
of
drive
this
was
final
i
got
to
think
said
bors
heavily
he
went
to
his
own
cabin
talents
incorporated
could
improvise
or
precognize
or
calculate
an
answer
to
this
and
all
previous
plans
had
to
be
cancelled
absolutely
he
dismissed
at
once
and
for
all
time
the
idea
that
the
could
be
repaired
short
of
months
in
a
on
a
friendly
planet
she
should
be
blown
up
after
adequate
pains
were
taken
to
destroy
any
novelties
in
her
there
were
the
tables
of
calculation
bors
found
himself
thinking
sardonically
that
logan
should
be
shot
because
he
had
no
obligation
of
loyalty
to
kandar
and
could
as
readily
satisfy
his
hunger
for
recognition
in
the
mekinese
service
as
in
kandar
the
crew
that
was
the
heart
of
the
situation
the
could
not
be
salvaged
she
should
be
destroyed
there
was
only
one
world
within
reach
on
which
human
beings
could
live
that
world
was
garen
the
could
sit
down
on
garen
disembark
her
crew
and
be
blown
up
before
mekinese
authorities
could
interfere
perhaps
possibly
her
crew
could
try
to
function
on
garen
as
marooned
pirates
as
outlaws
as
rebels
against
the
puppet
planetary
government
but
they
knew
too
much
every
man
aboard
knew
how
the
missiles
worked
logan
might
be
the
only
man
who
had
ever
calculated
the
tables
for
their
use
but
if
any
member
of
the
crew
were
captured
and
made
to
talk
he
could
tell
enough
for
mekinese
mathematicians
to
start
work
with
if
logan
were
captured
he
could
tell
more
he
could
not
only
the
tables
for
the
missiles
but
the
data
for
overdrive
which
would
make
any
fleet
invincible
and
there
was
the
kandarian
fleet
if
its
existence
became
known
it
would
mean
the
destruction
of
kandar
every
soul
of
all
its
millions
would
die
with
every
tree
and
blade
of
grass
every
flower
beast
and
singing
bird
even
the
plankton
in
its
seas
bors
had
arrived
at
the
grimmest
decision
of
his
life
when
his
cabin
speaker
said
curtly
bors
sir
sylva
asks
for
i
here
said
bors
gwenlyn
voice
came
out
of
the
speaker
you
in
trouble
captain
one
of
our
talents
insists
that
you
bors
swallowed
i
thought
you
gone
on
as
you
were
supposed
to
do
yes
there
is
trouble
it
amounts
to
shipwreck
how
many
of
my
men
can
you
take
off
lots
of
room
said
gwenlyn
father
kept
most
of
the
talents
with
him
we
heading
your
way
very
good
said
bors
thank
you
he
was
grateful
but
help
from
a
woman
from
gwenlyn
galled
him
he
heard
her
click
off
and
shivered
presently
the
was
alongside
the
transfer
of
the
crew
began
bors
went
over
the
ship
for
the
last
time
the
ship
log
went
aboard
the
as
did
logan
calculated
tables
for
overdrive
bors
made
quite
sure
that
nothing
else
could
be
recovered
from
the
he
looked
strained
and
irritable
when
he
finally
went
into
one
of
the
lifeboat
blisters
on
the
left
vacant
by
the
sacrifice
of
two
in
the
garen
expedition
a
boat
from
the
was
there
to
receive
him
technically
said
bors
i
should
go
down
with
my
ship
or
fly
apart
with
it
but
there
no
point
in
being
romantic
i
the
one
said
his
who
will
stand
i
doubt
it
very
much
said
bors
they
ca
you
for
partly
accomplishing
something
they
in
trouble
for
failing
at
into
the
boat
with
you
he
threw
a
switch
and
entered
the
boat
the
blister
opened
the
small
floated
free
its
drive
hummed
and
it
drove
far
and
away
from
the
seemingly
unharmed
but
completely
helpless
bors
looked
regretfully
back
at
the
abandoned
light
cruiser
sunlight
glinted
on
its
hull
somehow
a
slow
rotary
motion
had
been
imparted
to
it
during
the
process
of
abandoning
ship
the
little
fighting
ship
pointed
as
though
wistfully
at
all
the
stars
about
her
to
none
of
which
she
would
ever
drive
again
the
loomed
up
the
last
nestled
into
its
blister
and
the
grapples
clanked
the
leaves
closed
when
the
blister
showed
normal
and
green
lights
flashed
and
flashed
bors
got
out
of
the
boat
and
went
to
the
gwenlyn
was
there
quite
casually
controlling
the
operation
of
the
yacht
by
giving
suggestions
to
its
official
skipper
she
turned
and
beamed
at
bors
we
pull
off
a
way
she
observed
and
make
sure
your
works
you
would
want
her
discovered
and
salvaged
no
said
bors
he
stood
by
a
viewport
as
the
drove
away
the
ceased
to
be
a
shape
and
became
the
most
minute
of
motes
bors
looked
at
his
watch
not
far
enough
yet
he
said
depressedly
everything
will
go
the
yacht
drove
on
fifteen
twenty
minutes
at
steadily
increasing
speed
it
about
due
said
bors
gwenlyn
came
and
stood
beside
him
they
looked
together
out
at
the
stars
there
were
myriads
upon
myriads
of
them
of
all
the
colors
of
the
spectrum
of
all
degrees
of
brightness
in
every
possible
asymmetric
distribution
there
was
a
spark
in
remoteness
instantly
it
was
vastly
more
than
a
spark
it
was
a
globe
of
deadly
incandescence
it
flamed
brilliantly
as
all
the
fuel
and
the
warheads
on
all
its
unexpended
missiles
turned
to
pure
energy
in
the
of
a
second
it
was
many
times
brighter
than
a
sun
then
it
was
not
and
the
violence
of
the
explosion
was
such
that
there
was
not
even
glowing
where
it
had
been
every
atom
of
the
ship
substance
had
been
volatilized
and
scattered
through
so
many
thousands
of
cubic
miles
of
emptiness
that
it
did
not
show
even
as
a
mist
a
good
ship
said
bors
grimly
then
he
growled
i
wonder
if
they
saw
that
on
garen
and
what
they
thought
about
it
he
straightened
himself
how
did
you
know
we
were
in
trouble
there
a
talent
said
gwenlyn
who
can
always
tell
how
people
feel
she
does
know
what
they
think
or
why
but
she
can
tell
when
they
uneasy
and
so
on
father
uses
her
to
tell
him
when
people
lie
when
what
they
say
does
match
how
they
feel
lying
i
think
said
bors
that
i
stay
away
from
her
but
that
wo
do
any
good
will
it
gwenlyn
smiled
at
him
it
was
a
very
nice
smile
she
could
tell
that
things
had
gone
wrong
with
the
ship
she
observed
because
of
the
way
you
felt
but
i
forbidden
her
ever
to
tell
when
someone
lies
to
me
or
anything
like
that
i
do
want
to
know
feelings
when
they
want
to
hide
them
fine
said
bors
i
feel
better
standing
so
close
to
gwenlyn
he
also
felt
she
smiled
at
him
again
as
if
she
understood
we
head
for
glamis
now
she
said
the
situation
there
should
have
changed
a
great
deal
because
of
what
you
done
it
would
be
my
kind
of
luck
said
bors
half
joking
for
it
to
have
changed
for
the
worse
it
had
chapter
the
decision
said
king
humphrey
the
eighth
stubbornly
is
exactly
what
i
have
said
in
full
war
council
it
has
been
agreed
that
the
fleet
through
a
new
use
of
missiles
is
a
stronger
fighting
force
than
ever
before
this
was
evidenced
in
the
late
battle
and
no
one
questions
it
but
it
is
also
agreed
that
we
remain
hopelessly
outnumbered
we
are
in
a
position
where
we
simply
can
not
fight
for
us
to
have
fought
would
probably
have
been
forgiven
if
we
had
been
wiped
out
in
the
recent
battle
preferably
with
only
slight
loss
to
the
mekinese
we
offered
battle
expecting
exactly
that
unfortunately
we
annihilated
the
fleet
that
was
to
have
occupied
kandar
in
consequence
we
have
had
to
pretend
that
we
were
destroyed
along
with
them
and
if
we
are
discovered
to
be
alive
and
certainly
if
we
offer
to
fight
kandar
will
be
exterminated
as
a
living
world
to
punish
us
and
as
a
warning
to
future
victims
of
the
mekinese
yes
majesty
bors
said
through
tight
lips
but
may
i
point
out
i
know
what
you
want
to
point
out
the
king
broke
in
irritably
with
the
help
of
these
talents
incorporated
people
you
worked
out
a
new
battle
tactic
you
want
to
put
into
practice
you
explained
it
to
the
war
council
the
war
council
has
decided
that
it
is
too
risky
we
can
not
gamble
the
lives
of
the
people
on
kandar
we
have
not
the
right
to
expose
them
to
mekinese
vengeance
i
agree
majesty
said
bors
but
at
the
same
time
the
king
leaned
back
in
his
chair
i
do
like
it
any
better
than
you
do
he
said
peevishly
i
expected
to
get
killed
in
a
not
very
gloriously
but
at
least
with
unfortunately
we
had
bad
luck
we
won
the
fight
i
do
not
like
what
we
have
to
do
in
consequence
but
we
have
to
do
it
bors
bit
his
lips
he
liked
and
respected
king
humphrey
as
he
had
respect
and
affection
for
his
uncle
the
pretender
of
tralee
both
were
honest
and
able
men
who
been
forced
to
learn
the
disheartening
lesson
that
some
things
are
impossible
but
bors
believed
that
king
humphrey
had
learned
the
lesson
too
well
you
plan
majesty
he
said
after
a
moment
to
send
me
out
again
to
capture
if
i
can
obviously
said
the
king
the
idea
being
bors
went
on
that
if
i
can
get
enough
food
for
the
fleet
so
it
can
make
a
journey
of
several
hundreds
of
it
is
necessary
to
go
a
long
way
the
king
confirmed
unhappily
we
need
to
take
the
fleet
to
where
mekin
is
only
a
name
and
kandar
not
even
that
where
you
will
disband
the
fleet
yes
and
hope
that
mekin
will
not
take
vengeance
anyhow
for
the
fight
the
fleet
has
already
put
up
the
king
said
heavily
it
will
be
a
very
long
time
before
word
drifts
back
that
the
fleet
of
kandar
did
not
die
in
battle
it
may
never
come
if
it
does
it
will
come
as
a
vague
rumor
as
an
idle
tale
as
absurd
gossip
about
a
fleet
whose
home
planet
may
not
even
be
remembered
when
the
tales
are
told
there
will
be
trivial
stories
about
a
fleet
which
abandoned
the
world
it
should
have
defended
and
fled
so
far
that
its
enemies
did
not
bother
to
follow
it
if
the
tale
reaches
mekin
it
may
not
be
believed
it
may
not
ever
be
linked
to
kandar
and
if
some
day
it
is
believed
by
then
kandar
will
be
long
occupied
perhaps
it
will
be
resigned
to
its
status
it
will
be
a
valuable
subject
world
mekin
will
not
destroy
it
merely
to
punish
scattered
forgotten
men
who
will
never
know
that
they
have
been
punished
and
you
want
me
repeated
bors
to
find
the
stores
of
food
that
will
let
the
fleet
travel
to
oblivion
yes
said
the
king
again
he
looked
very
weary
in
a
sense
of
course
we
will
simply
be
doing
what
we
set
out
to
do
to
throw
away
our
lives
we
intended
to
do
that
we
are
doing
no
more
now
bors
said
grimly
i
not
sure
but
i
will
obey
orders
majesty
do
you
object
if
i
pass
out
the
details
of
the
new
device
among
some
junior
officers
i
speak
of
the
way
to
compute
overdrive
speed
exactly
and
how
to
vary
it
it
could
help
the
fleet
to
stay
together
even
in
overdrive
the
king
shrugged
that
would
be
desirable
i
do
not
object
i
do
it
then
majesty
said
bors
i
be
assigned
a
new
ship
like
the
same
crew
i
do
my
best
in
a
new
part
of
the
mekinese
empire
this
time
yes
said
the
king
drearily
do
make
a
pattern
of
raids
that
would
suggest
that
you
have
a
base
you
understand
it
is
impossible
to
use
more
than
one
ship
naturally
agreed
bors
one
more
suggestion
majesty
a
ship
could
be
sent
back
to
kandar
not
to
land
but
to
watch
if
a
single
mekinese
ship
went
there
to
ask
questions
it
could
be
destroyed
perhaps
which
would
gain
us
time
i
will
think
about
it
said
the
king
doubtfully
maybe
it
has
occurred
to
someone
else
i
will
see
meantime
you
will
go
to
the
admiral
for
a
new
ship
and
then
do
what
you
can
to
find
provisions
for
the
fleet
it
is
not
good
for
us
to
merely
stay
here
waiting
for
nothing
even
action
toward
our
own
disappearance
is
preferable
bors
saluted
he
went
to
the
office
of
the
admiral
the
of
the
kandarian
fleet
was
making
an
inspection
to
maintain
tight
discipline
in
the
absence
of
hope
a
young
was
on
duty
in
the
admiral
stead
he
regarded
bors
with
approval
he
listened
with
attention
and
agreed
with
most
of
what
bors
had
to
say
i
push
the
idea
of
a
sentry
over
kandar
he
said
confidentially
i
make
it
two
ships
or
three
and
take
command
i
want
to
send
some
of
my
engineer
officers
to
get
the
details
of
that
overdrive
a
very
pretty
tactical
idea
it
should
be
spread
throughout
the
fleet
it
will
help
bors
said
with
irony
when
we
go
so
far
away
that
never
be
heard
of
any
more
eh
the
looked
at
him
blankly
oh
perhaps
you
be
likely
to
pick
up
a
loaded
with
mekinese
missiles
would
you
we
could
adapt
them
to
our
use
if
i
did
bors
answered
i
suspect
that
somehow
that
ship
would
land
itself
on
mekin
and
blow
up
as
it
touched
ground
the
raised
his
eyebrows
bors
saluted
quickly
and
left
presently
he
was
back
on
the
his
new
command
would
be
supplied
with
extra
missiles
from
other
ships
despite
the
fleet
action
against
the
mekinese
there
was
not
yet
a
shortage
of
such
ammunition
when
a
missile
could
not
be
intercepted
and
itself
did
not
try
to
intercept
the
economy
of
missiles
was
great
in
the
battle
of
the
planet
the
fleet
had
fired
no
more
than
three
or
four
missiles
for
every
enemy
ship
destroyed
morgan
took
bors
aside
i
going
to
keep
logan
here
this
trip
i
working
on
the
commanders
i
need
him
and
our
talent
for
detecting
lies
she
was
the
one
who
knew
you
were
in
trouble
gwenlyn
tells
me
is
very
necessary
i
was
hampered
by
not
having
her
while
gwenlyn
was
away
but
she
did
a
good
job
for
you
bors
shrugged
he
did
not
like
depending
upon
talents
he
still
inclined
toward
acceptance
of
what
he
considered
the
occult
now
he
said
i
duly
grateful
but
it
just
as
well
my
mind
does
work
in
a
way
to
understand
these
talents
of
yours
i
admit
everything
but
afraid
i
do
really
accept
anything
it
perfectly
reasonable
protested
morgan
the
facts
fit
together
i
no
hand
at
working
out
theories
i
deal
in
facts
but
the
facts
do
make
sense
bors
found
himself
looking
at
the
door
of
the
family
room
where
morgan
had
taken
him
he
realized
that
he
was
waiting
for
gwenlyn
to
enter
he
turned
back
to
morgan
they
do
make
sense
to
me
he
said
dourly
you
have
a
precognizer
you
say
he
foresees
the
future
i
admit
that
he
has
but
the
future
is
uncertain
it
ca
be
foreseen
unless
it
and
in
that
case
we
only
puppets
imagining
that
we
free
agents
but
there
would
be
no
reason
in
such
a
state
of
things
morgan
settled
himself
luxuriously
in
a
chair
he
thrust
a
cigar
on
bors
and
lighted
up
zestfully
i
been
wanting
to
spout
about
that
he
observed
even
if
i
no
theoretician
look
here
what
is
true
what
is
truth
what
the
difference
between
a
false
statement
and
a
true
one
bors
eyes
wandered
to
the
door
again
he
drew
them
back
one
so
and
the
other
is
he
said
no
said
morgan
truth
is
an
accordance
an
agreement
between
an
idea
and
a
fact
if
i
toss
a
coin
i
can
make
two
statements
i
can
say
it
will
come
up
heads
or
i
can
say
that
it
will
come
up
tails
one
sentence
is
true
and
one
is
false
a
precognizer
simply
knows
which
statement
is
true
i
do
but
he
does
it
still
prophecy
objected
bors
oh
no
protested
morgan
a
does
prophesy
all
he
can
do
is
recognize
that
an
idea
he
has
now
matches
an
event
that
will
happen
presently
he
ca
extract
ideas
from
the
future
he
can
only
judge
the
truth
or
falsity
of
ideas
that
occur
to
him
he
has
to
think
something
before
he
can
know
it
is
true
he
not
get
information
from
the
future
he
can
only
know
that
the
idea
he
has
now
matches
something
that
will
happen
later
he
can
detect
a
matching
an
agreement
perhaps
it
a
mental
vibration
of
some
sort
but
all
i
asked
if
i
would
capture
a
on
tralee
and
i
said
i
did
know
of
course
i
said
so
how
could
anybody
know
such
a
thing
except
by
pure
accident
a
precognizer
might
think
of
nine
hundred
and
ways
in
which
you
might
try
to
capture
that
ship
they
could
all
be
wrong
he
might
say
you
would
capture
it
but
you
might
try
a
thousandth
way
that
he
had
thought
of
all
he
can
know
is
that
some
idea
he
has
concocted
matches
some
instinct
stirs
and
he
it
true
that
why
one
man
can
precognize
dirty
tricks
his
mind
works
that
way
we
got
a
woman
who
knows
infallibly
who
going
to
marry
whom
that
why
the
precognizer
can
say
a
ship
coming
in
his
mind
works
on
such
things
and
he
has
a
talent
besides
there
are
definite
limits
then
what
is
there
that
real
and
has
limits
demanded
morgan
the
door
opened
and
gwenlyn
came
in
bors
rose
looking
pleased
i
telling
him
the
facts
of
life
about
precognition
morgan
told
her
i
think
he
understands
now
i
do
agree
said
bors
gwenlyn
said
amusedly
two
of
our
talents
want
to
talk
to
you
captain
you
might
say
that
they
want
to
measure
you
for
rumors
they
what
demanded
bors
startled
the
talent
who
predicts
dirty
tricks
said
gwenlyn
is
going
to
work
with
the
woman
who
broadcasts
daydreams
they
be
our
department
of
propaganda
bors
said
uncertainly
but
there
no
point
in
propaganda
determined
i
know
said
morgan
complacently
the
high
brass
has
made
a
decision
a
perfectly
logical
decision
too
once
you
grant
their
premises
but
they
assume
that
talents
incorporated
given
some
of
course
lacks
the
ability
to
change
the
situation
in
that
mistaken
father
hopes
said
gwenlyn
amiably
to
modify
the
situation
so
their
assumptions
will
lead
logically
to
a
different
conclusion
apparently
they
going
to
change
their
minds
bors
objected
but
you
ca
know
the
future
our
precognizer
our
precognizer
for
special
events
said
gwenlyn
got
the
notion
that
a
year
from
now
king
humphrey
should
open
parliament
on
kandar
if
everything
is
straightened
out
the
notion
became
a
precognition
we
do
know
how
it
can
come
about
but
it
does
seem
to
imply
a
change
of
plans
somewhere
bors
found
himself
indomitably
skeptical
but
he
said
ah
that
the
precognition
you
mentioned
on
kandar
that
the
fleet
would
be
wiped
out
and
everybody
killed
said
gwenlyn
that
was
another
one
i
rather
not
tell
you
about
it
it
might
be
unpleasant
i
tell
you
later
bors
shrugged
all
right
you
said
i
to
be
measured
for
rumors
bring
on
your
morgan
beamed
at
him
gwenlyn
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
an
enormously
fat
woman
came
in
moving
somehow
sinuously
in
spite
of
her
bulk
she
gave
bors
a
glance
he
could
not
fathom
it
was
sentimental
languishing
and
wholly
and
utterly
approving
he
felt
a
momentary
appalled
suspicion
which
he
dismissed
in
something
close
to
panic
it
could
be
that
he
was
fated
then
the
arrogant
man
with
rings
came
in
he
been
identified
as
the
talent
for
predicting
dirty
tricks
bors
remembered
that
he
had
a
paranoid
personality
inclined
toward
infinite
suspiciousness
and
that
he
been
in
jail
for
predicting
crimes
that
were
later
committed
gwenlyn
says
propaganda
said
morgan
but
i
prefer
to
think
of
these
two
talents
as
our
department
for
disseminating
truthful
seditious
rumors
you
met
harms
the
man
waved
his
hand
his
rings
glittering
but
i
did
tell
you
about
madame
porvis
she
has
the
extraordinary
talent
of
contagious
fantasy
it
is
remarkably
rare
she
can
daydream
and
others
contract
her
dreamings
as
if
they
were
spread
by
germs
the
fat
woman
bridled
she
still
regarded
bors
with
a
melting
gaze
again
he
felt
startled
unease
it
been
a
great
trial
to
me
she
said
in
a
peculiarly
childish
voice
i
had
such
trouble
before
i
knew
what
it
was
er
trial
asked
bors
apprehensively
when
i
was
just
an
overweight
adolescent
she
told
him
archly
i
daydreamed
about
my
school
best
athlete
presently
i
found
that
my
shocked
were
gossiping
to
each
other
that
he
acted
as
i
daydreamed
other
girls
would
look
at
him
because
they
said
he
was
madly
in
love
with
me
the
arrogant
man
with
the
rings
made
a
scornful
sound
he
hated
me
said
madame
porvis
ruefully
because
the
gossip
made
him
ridiculous
and
it
was
only
people
picking
up
my
daydreams
she
looked
at
morgan
he
nodded
encouragement
years
later
she
said
to
bors
i
grew
romantic
about
an
actor
he
was
not
at
all
talented
but
i
daydreamed
that
he
was
and
also
brilliant
and
worshipped
by
millions
soon
everybody
seemed
to
believe
it
was
true
because
i
daydreamed
it
he
was
given
tremendous
contracts
and
then
i
dared
to
daydream
that
he
met
and
was
fascinated
by
me
immediately
there
was
gossip
that
it
had
happened
when
he
denied
that
he
knew
me
and
he
did
and
when
he
saw
my
picture
and
said
he
did
to
i
was
crushed
i
wove
beautifully
tragic
fantasies
about
myself
as
pining
away
and
dying
because
of
his
cruelty
and
soon
it
was
common
gossip
that
i
had
she
sighed
he
was
considered
a
villain
because
i
daydreamed
of
him
that
way
his
career
was
ruined
i
had
to
be
very
careful
about
my
daydreams
ever
since
madame
porvis
talent
morgan
said
proudly
is
all
the
more
remarkable
because
she
realized
herself
that
she
had
it
she
lets
ideas
pop
into
her
head
and
presently
they
pop
into
other
people
heads
and
you
have
rumors
running
madly
about
when
her
fantasies
contain
elements
of
truth
so
do
the
rumors
you
see
it
most
interesting
admitted
bors
but
now
harms
said
morgan
reads
he
specialized
on
those
brought
back
by
gwenlyn
and
by
you
he
guesses
at
the
news
behind
the
news
and
he
knows
when
he
hit
it
he
tell
madame
porvis
the
facts
she
weave
them
into
a
fantasy
and
they
spread
like
wildfire
of
course
she
ca
plant
new
subjects
in
people
minds
but
anybody
ever
heard
of
mekin
will
pick
up
her
fantasies
about
graft
and
inefficiency
in
its
government
riots
against
mekin
and
so
on
however
one
wants
not
only
to
spread
seditious
rumors
about
villains
but
also
about
say
pirates
who
go
about
fighting
mekin
tell
her
stories
about
your
men
if
you
like
anything
that
material
for
heroic
against
mekin
bors
found
himself
stubbornly
resisting
the
idea
it
might
be
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
precognition
in
the
form
morgan
had
described
there
might
be
such
a
thing
as
contagious
fantasy
but
on
the
other
hand
i
give
up
he
said
i
wo
deny
it
and
i
ca
believe
it
i
go
about
my
business
of
piracy
but
you
sir
he
turned
to
morgan
got
to
keep
gwenlyn
from
taking
risks
true
said
morgan
she
could
have
some
very
unpleasant
experiences
i
be
more
stern
with
her
gwenlyn
did
not
seem
alarmed
one
more
thing
bors
added
they
say
the
dictator
of
mekin
is
superstitious
that
he
patronizes
suppose
one
of
is
a
talent
suppose
gets
precognized
information
i
worry
about
that
admitted
morgan
but
i
know
that
i
have
effective
talents
there
no
evidence
that
has
he
might
have
a
talent
whose
talent
is
confusing
our
talents
bors
said
with
some
sarcasm
morgan
grinned
tolerantly
talk
to
these
two
we
got
some
firm
precognitions
that
make
things
look
bad
for
mekin
he
left
the
room
gwenlyn
remained
listening
with
interest
when
the
conversation
began
and
now
and
then
saying
something
of
no
great
importance
but
her
presence
kept
bors
from
feeling
altogether
like
a
fool
madame
porvis
looked
at
him
with
languishing
sentimental
eyes
harms
watched
him
accusingly
their
questions
were
trivial
bors
told
about
the
landings
on
tralee
and
on
garen
the
woman
asked
for
details
that
would
help
her
picture
feats
of
bors
hesitated
and
did
not
quite
tell
her
about
the
truck
drivers
on
tralee
who
volunteered
the
information
that
their
loads
were
but
he
did
stress
the
fact
that
the
populations
of
dominated
planets
were
on
the
thin
edge
of
revolt
the
suspicious
talent
asked
very
little
he
listened
frowning
when
it
was
over
and
they
gone
the
fat
woman
again
somehow
managing
a
gait
which
could
only
be
called
sinuous
bors
said
abruptly
this
event
you
know
of
a
year
ahead
king
humphrey
opening
parliament
on
kandar
said
gwenlyn
pleasantly
there
another
said
bors
which
implies
specifically
that
still
be
alive
that
said
gwenlyn
that
another
one
i
wo
talk
about
it
it
implies
that
my
father
going
to
retire
from
talents
incorporated
bors
fumed
i
do
like
this
prediction
business
he
said
it
still
seems
to
hint
that
we
not
free
agents
tell
me
he
said
apprehensively
that
precognition
about
me
it
does
include
madame
porvis
gwenlyn
laughed
no
definitely
no
bors
grunted
then
he
managed
to
grin
in
that
case
i
go
pilfer
some
provisions
so
the
fleet
will
be
prepared
to
do
what
you
tell
me
it
wo
but
which
it
has
to
be
prepared
to
do
i
suppose
i
be
back
i
hope
so
said
gwenlyn
smiling
she
gave
him
her
hand
he
left
he
shook
his
head
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
blister
he
had
it
immediately
taken
to
his
new
ship
it
was
a
light
cruiser
of
the
same
class
as
the
it
would
of
course
seem
to
be
the
same
ship
and
it
had
nearly
the
same
crew
aboard
no
one
of
morgan
freakish
talents
was
included
this
time
and
bors
felt
more
than
a
little
relieved
he
inspected
everything
and
made
sure
his
were
more
tractable
than
they
been
on
the
he
meant
to
build
another
overdrive
at
once
he
cleared
for
departure
with
the
flagship
he
was
swinging
the
ship
toward
his
first
destination
when
a
call
came
from
the
he
was
asked
for
he
went
to
a
screen
he
preferred
to
see
gwenlyn
when
he
talked
to
her
she
was
there
a
memo
for
she
said
briskly
are
aground
on
cassis
and
dover
there
is
a
sort
of
of
warships
aground
on
meriden
nothing
on
avino
are
you
recording
this
i
wo
forget
it
he
said
here
the
situation
on
each
of
the
subject
worlds
so
far
as
and
fighting
ships
are
concerned
our
dowser
can
tell
about
them
remember
this
does
apply
to
ships
in
overdrive
we
precognize
anything
about
them
unless
we
at
the
destination
heading
for
and
then
only
the
time
of
arrival
and
the
information
is
strictly
as
of
this
bors
nodded
her
tone
was
absolutely
bors
was
almost
convinced
she
read
off
a
list
of
statements
with
painstaking
clarity
evidently
had
the
dowser
go
over
the
list
of
dominated
planets
bors
told
himself
that
the
events
she
reported
were
possibilities
that
might
somehow
be
true
of
the
mekinese
grand
she
finished
aground
on
mekin
itself
it
probably
there
for
inspection
and
review
or
some
such
ceremony
there
no
way
to
tell
but
it
there
and
that
the
latest
talents
incorporated
information
as
my
father
says
you
can
depend
on
all
right
said
bors
thanks
then
he
added
gruffly
take
care
of
yourself
she
smiled
at
him
and
clicked
off
bors
was
confused
because
he
quite
believe
that
other
matters
could
be
predicted
the
new
ship
the
sped
away
in
overdrive
leaving
the
fleet
in
orbit
around
the
useless
planet
glamis
glamis
was
in
a
favorable
state
just
now
it
was
a
lush
green
almost
from
pole
to
pole
save
where
its
seas
showed
a
darker
muddy
it
would
look
inviting
to
colonists
but
at
any
time
its
sun
could
demonstrate
its
variability
and
turn
it
into
a
world
of
steaming
prospective
jungle
or
in
a
slightly
shorter
time
turn
it
to
a
the
vegetation
on
glamis
was
remarkable
the
planet
though
was
of
no
use
to
humanity
because
it
was
unpredictable
the
ran
in
overdrive
for
two
days
while
a
unit
was
built
in
its
to
go
in
parallel
to
the
normal
overdrive
but
there
was
a
switch
in
the
line
now
either
the
standard
multiple
overdrive
could
be
used
or
the
newer
and
vastly
slower
one
but
not
both
together
the
ship
came
out
of
overdrive
in
absolute
emptiness
with
no
sun
anywhere
nearby
she
was
surrounded
on
every
hand
by
uncountable
distant
stars
the
new
circuit
was
brazed
in
it
had
a
included
in
its
design
within
its
certain
limited
it
could
establish
or
break
a
contact
within
the
thousandth
of
a
microsecond
bors
made
tests
of
a
sort
he
let
out
a
balloon
which
inflated
itself
making
a
sphere
some
forty
feet
in
diameter
in
the
new
overdrive
he
drew
away
from
it
for
a
limited
number
of
microseconds
he
measured
the
distance
run
he
made
other
runs
again
measuring
from
ten
thousand
miles
away
he
made
a
to
the
and
came
out
within
a
mile
of
it
he
cheered
up
this
was
remarkably
accurate
he
sent
the
ship
into
standard
overdrive
again
twice
more
however
he
stopped
between
stars
and
practiced
the
trick
of
breaking
out
of
the
new
overdrive
in
which
his
ship
was
undetectable
at
a
predetermined
point
the
satisfaction
of
successful
operation
almost
made
up
for
the
extremely
disagreeable
sensations
involved
but
on
the
eighth
out
from
glamis
the
came
back
to
unstressed
space
with
a
very
very
bright
star
burning
almost
straight
ahead
the
spectroscope
confirmed
that
it
was
the
sun
of
meriden
bors
sounded
the
action
alert
gongs
clanged
hissed
shut
you
know
said
bors
conversationally
into
the
microphone
and
in
the
cushioned
stillness
which
obtained
you
all
know
what
aiming
at
a
for
the
fleet
but
we
got
what
looks
like
a
very
useful
gadget
for
fighting
purposes
we
need
to
test
it
there
a
small
squadron
on
meriden
ahead
so
we
take
them
on
it
is
necessary
that
we
get
of
so
they
ca
report
anything
to
mekin
that
mekin
does
already
know
all
hands
ready
for
action
in
twenty
minutes
by
the
ship
clocks
the
was
a
bare
thirty
thousand
miles
off
the
planet
meriden
the
new
drive
worked
perfectly
for
planetary
approach
at
any
rate
it
even
worked
more
perfectly
than
the
interval
implied
it
had
been
off
meriden
for
five
minutes
then
mekinese
fighting
ships
were
boiling
up
from
the
atmosphere
of
meriden
and
plunging
out
to
space
to
offer
battle
they
were
surprisingly
ready
reacting
like
weapons
bors
had
completed
his
challenge
before
they
were
streaking
toward
meriden
sky
they
could
have
been
more
prompt
if
say
meriden
seethed
with
rumors
about
a
pirate
ship
in
space
which
it
was
their
obligation
to
fight
according
to
the
radar
screens
there
were
not
less
than
fifteen
ships
streaking
out
to
destroy
the
fifteen
to
one
interesting
odds
bors
sent
the
roaring
ahead
to
meet
them
part
four
chapter
the
mekinese
did
not
display
a
sporting
spirit
there
were
four
heavy
cruisers
and
eleven
lighter
ships
of
the
size
and
armament
according
to
current
theories
of
tactics
two
of
the
light
cruisers
should
have
disposed
of
the
with
ease
and
dispatch
it
might
have
seemed
sportsmanlike
and
certainly
sufficient
to
give
the
only
two
antagonists
at
a
time
which
would
have
been
calculated
to
provide
odds
of
six
hundred
to
one
against
it
two
light
cruisers
would
have
fired
eighteen
missiles
apiece
per
salvo
which
would
have
demanded
missiles
from
the
to
meet
and
destroy
them
she
could
put
missiles
into
space
at
one
firing
she
would
have
disappeared
in
atomic
flame
at
the
first
exchange
of
fire
but
the
mekinese
were
not
so
generous
they
came
up
in
full
force
loaded
for
bear
they
obviously
intended
not
a
fight
but
an
execution
mekinese
tactics
depended
heavily
on
of
such
superiority
that
any
enemy
was
simply
overwhelmed
their
maneuvering
proved
that
they
intended
to
follow
standard
operation
procedure
light
ships
reached
space
and
delayed
until
all
were
aloft
they
formed
themselves
into
a
precise
and
plunged
at
top
drive
toward
the
this
was
strictly
according
to
the
book
if
the
chose
of
course
she
could
refuse
battle
by
fleeing
into
overdrive
which
would
be
expected
to
be
the
regulation
variety
if
she
dared
fight
the
fifteen
ships
drove
on
mekinese
ships
never
struck
lightly
the
fifteen
of
them
could
launch
four
hundred
missiles
per
salvo
no
single
ship
could
counter
such
an
attack
but
even
mekinese
would
not
use
such
stupendous
numbers
of
missiles
against
one
ship
unless
that
ship
was
famous
unless
rumors
and
reports
said
that
it
was
invincible
and
dangerous
and
the
hope
of
oppressed
peoples
under
mekin
the
received
very
special
attention
then
she
vanished
at
one
instant
she
was
in
full
career
toward
the
fleet
of
enemies
the
next
instant
she
had
wrapped
an
overdrive
field
about
herself
and
then
no
radar
could
detect
her
nor
could
any
missile
penetrate
her
protection
when
she
vanished
the
speck
which
indicated
her
position
disappeared
from
the
mekinese
the
hundredth
of
a
second
in
overdrive
as
known
to
the
mekinese
should
have
put
her
hundreds
of
millions
of
miles
away
but
something
new
had
been
added
to
the
the
hundredth
of
a
second
did
not
mean
millions
of
miles
of
journeying
it
meant
something
under
three
thousand
and
a
much
more
precise
interval
of
time
could
be
measured
and
used
by
her
therefore
at
one
instant
the
was
some
two
thousand
miles
from
the
lip
of
the
of
enemy
ships
then
she
was
not
anywhere
then
before
the
mind
could
grasp
the
fact
of
her
vanishing
she
was
in
the
very
center
the
exact
focus
of
the
formation
of
mekinese
she
was
at
the
spot
a
mekinese
commander
would
most
devoutly
wish
because
it
was
equidistant
from
all
his
ships
and
all
their
missiles
should
arrive
at
the
same
instant
when
their
overwhelming
number
could
not
conceivably
be
parried
but
it
was
more
than
an
ideal
position
from
a
mekinese
standpoint
it
was
also
a
point
which
was
ideal
for
the
because
all
her
missiles
would
arrive
at
the
encircling
ships
at
the
same
instant
each
mekinese
would
separately
learn
without
information
from
any
other
that
those
projectiles
could
not
be
intercepted
no
mekinese
would
have
the
advantage
of
watching
the
tactic
practiced
on
a

guide
his
own
actions

that
utterly
vulnerable
and
wholly
advantageous

on

launched
missiles
the
launched
missiles
the
disappeared
she
reappeared
beyond
and
behind
the
formation
again
she
showed
on
the
mekinese
screens
the
mekinese
could
not
believe
their
instruments
a
ship
which
fled
in
overdrive
could
not
reappear
like
this
having
vanished
and
reappeared
once
it
could
not
duplicate
the
trick
having
duplicated
it
there
was
more
and
worse
the
missiles
were
not
being
intercepted
mekinese
missiles
were
swerving
crazily
to
try
to
anticipate
and
destroy
the
curving
objects
that
went
out
from

the

ceased
to
be

turned
from

glanced
at

were
thirteen
vaporous
glowings
where

had
been

were
two
distinct
blips
remaining
it
could
be
guessed
that
some
targets
had
been
fired
on
by
more
than
one

two
ships
unattacked
by
the
missiles
both
of
those
ships

desperately
flung

accounted
for
one
of
the
two
mekinese
survivors
the
which
told
of
that
ship
existence
changed
to
the
vaguely
vaporous
glow
of
incandescent
gas
the
other
blip
went
out
no
flare
of
a
bomb
nothing
it
went
out
so
the
last
mekinese
ship
was
gone
in
overdrive
it
was
safe
it
could
not
possibly
be
overtaken
or
attacked
it
had
seen
the
missiles
following
an
unpredictable
course
which
was
duly
recorded
it
had
seen
the
go
into
overdrive
and
move
only
hundreds
of
miles
instead
of
hundreds
of
millions
it
had
seen
the
vanish
from
one
place
and
appear
at
another
in
the
same
combat
area
launch
missiles
and
vanish
again
before
it
could
even
be
ranged
the
last
mekinese
ship
certainly
carried
with
it
the
tactics
and
actions
recorded
on
tape
the
technicians
of
mekin
would
set
to
work
instantly
to
duplicate
them
once
they
were
considered
possible
once
they
were
recognized
they
could
be
achieved
the
combat
efficiency
of
the
mekinese
fleet
would
be
increased
as
greatly
as
that
of
the
fleet
of
kandar
had
been
and
the
overwhelming
superiority
of
numbers
would
again
become
decisive
the
hopeless
situation
of
the
kandarian
fleet
would
become
a
hundred
times
worse
and
mekinese
would
make
a
search
for
the
origin
of
such
improvements
since
kandar
was
to
have
been
attacked
and
occupied
it
would
be
a
place
of
special
search
the
only
unsuspected
source
of
course
would
be
talents
incorporated
for
a
full
minute
after
the
enemy
ship
disappearance
bors
sat
rigid
his
hands
clenched
facing
the
disaster
the
escape
of
the
mekinese
constituted
sweat
appeared
on
his
forehead
then
he
pressed
the
button
and
said
evenly
prepare
for
standard
overdrive
top
speed
possible
he
swung
the
ship
he
lined
it
up
with
mekin
itself
which
of
course
was
the
one
place
where
it
would
be
most
fatal
for
a
ship
from
kandar
to
be
discovered
very
shortly
thereafter
the
was
in
overdrive
traveling
in
such
unthinkable
haste
it
is
paradoxic
that
there
is
much
time
to
spare
bors
had
to
occupy
it
he
prepared
a
careful
and
detailed
account
of
exactly
how
the
overdrive
had
worked
and
its
effectiveness
as
a
combat
tactic
he
distributed
instructions
and
logan
tables
on
the
subject
before
leaving
glamis
he
would
be
of
course
most
bitterly
blamed
for
having
taken
on
a
whole
squadron
of
enemy
ships
with
the
result
that
one
had
gotten
away
it
could
be
the
most
decisive
of
catastrophes
but
he
made
his
report
with
precision
for
seven
successive
there
was
no
event
whatever
on
the
as
she
drove
toward
mekin
undoubtedly
the
one
survivor
of
the
enemy
squadron
was
fleeing
for
mekin
too
to
report
to
the
highest
possible
authority
what
it
had
seen
and
experienced
it
would
not
be
much
if
at
all
slower
than
the
it
might
be
faster
and
might
reach
the
solar
system
of
mekin
before
the
broke
out
there
it
had
every
advantage
but
one
it
had
drive
for
use
within
a
planetary
group
and
it
had
overdrive
for
use
between
the
stars
but
the
had
an
intermediate
drive
as
well
which
was
faster
than
the
enemy
slow
speed
and
slower
than
the
fast
bors
depended
on
it
for
the
continued
existence
of
kandar
and
the
fleet
as
the
desperately
tedious
went
by
he
began
to
have
ideas
at
which
he
consciously
scoffed
concerning
tralee
but
if
anything
as
absurd
as
those
ideas
came
to
be
there
were
a
score
of
other
planets
which
would
have
to
be
considered
too
he
sketched
out
in
his
own
mind
a
course
of
action
that
would
be
possible
to
follow
after
breakout
off
mekin
it
did
not
follow
the
rules
for
sound
planning
which
always
assume
that
if
things
can
go
wrong
they
will
bors
could
only
plan
for
what
might
be
done
if
things
went
right
but
he
could
not
hope
not
really
still
he
considered
every
possibility
however
he
came
to
a
short
of
mekin
the
yellow
sun
flamed
dead
ahead
he
determined
his
distance
from
it
with
very
great
care
the
went
back
into
overdrive
and
out
again
and
it
was
well
within
the
system
though
carefully
not
on
the
plane
of
its
ecliptic
then
the
waited
she
was
twenty
millions
of
miles
from
the
planet
mekin
bors
ordered
that
for
intervals
of
up
to
five
minutes
no
electronic
apparatus
on
the
ship
should
be
in
operation
in
those
periods
of
electronic
silence
his
radars
swept
all
of
space
except
mekin
he
had
no
desire
to
have
mekin
pick
up
and
wonder
what
they
came
from
the
rest
of
the
system
though
he
mapped
he
found
two
and
a
clump
of
three
planetoids
in
a
nearly
circular
orbit
and
he
spotted
a
ship
just
lifted
from
mekin
by
its
it
went
out
to
five
planetary
diameters
and
flicked
out
of
existence
so
far
as
radar
was
concerned
it
had
gone
into
overdrive
and
away
another
ship
came
around
mekin
in
orbit
it
reached
the
spot
from
which
the
first
ship
had
vanished
it
began
to
descend
the
had
locked
onto
it
with
projected
and
was
drawing
it
down
to
ground
bors
growled
to
himself
it
was
not
likely
that
this
ship
was
the
one
he
pursued
sight
unseen
since
the
end
of
the
fight
off
meriden
but
it
was
a
possibility
if
it
were
true
then
everything
that
mattered
to
bors
was
lost
forever
then
a
blip
appeared
it
was
at
the
most
extreme
limit
of
the
range
a
ship
had
come
out
of
overdrive
near
the
fourth
planetary
orbit
of
this
solar
system
bors
and
the
yeoman
figured
its
distance
to
six
places
of
decimals
bors
set
the
microsecond
timer
the
went
into
overdrive
and
out
again
then
the
electron
telescope
revealed
a
stubby
rotund
about
to
land
on
mekin
bors
swore
it
would
be
days
before
this
tub
reached
mekin
on
drive
but
it
must
not
report
that
an
armed
vessel
had
inspected
it
in
remoteness
we
haul
alongside
said
bors
angrily
ready
in
the
another
wrenching
flicker
into
overdrive
and
through
breakout
without
pause
the
was
within
ten
miles
calling
rasped
bors
in
what
would
be
the
arrogant
tones
of
a
mekinese
naval
officer
hailing
a
mere
civilian
ship
identify
yourself
a
voice
answered
apologetically
empress
bound
from
loral
to
mekin
with
frozen
cut
your
drive
snapped
bors
stand
by
for
inspection
muster
your
crews
there
a
criminal
trying
to
get
ashore
on
mekin
we
check
your
hands
acknowledge
said
the
apologetic
voice
bors
fretted
the
left
the
side
one
clamped
onto
the
airlock
of
the
rounded
bulging
the
second
lifeboat
hovered
nearby
the
first
boat
broke
contact
and
the
second
hooked
on
the
second
boat
broke
contact
both
came
back
to
the
the
screen
before
bors
lighted
up
one
of
his
own
crewmen
nodded
out
of
it
clear
said
his
voice
briskly
behaved
like
lambs
sir
no
arms
we
locked
them
in
a
cargo
you
know
what
to
do
now
said
bors
sir
ten
miles
away
the
swung
itself
about
suddenly
it
was
gone
it
was
on
the
way
to
glamis
and
the
fleet
another
hour
of
watching
another
blip
it
was
another
like
the
first
as
the
other
had
done
it
meekly
permitted
itself
to
be
boarded
by
what
it
believed
were
mere
naval
ratings
of
the
mekinese
searching
for
a
criminal
who
might
be
on
board
like
the
first
ship
it
was
soon
undeceived
again
like
the
first
it
vanished
from
emptiness
and
it
would
be
heading
for
the
fleet
in
its
monotonous
circling
of
glamis
the
third
blip
though
was
a
light
cruiser
the
appeared
from
nowhere
close
beside
it
and
its
communicator
began
to
scream
in
gibberish
it
would
be
an
official
report
scrambled
and
taped
to
be
transmitted
to
ground
on
the
first
instant
there
was
hope
of
its
reception
fire
one
said
bors
the
skipper
there
is
on
his
toes
he
watched
bleakly
as
the
missile
arched
in
its
impossible
trajectory
as
the
light
cruiser
flung
everything
that
could
be
gotten
out
to
try
to
stop
it
while
its
transmitter
shrieked
gibberish
to
the
stars
there
was
a
blinding
flash
of
light
then
nothing
he
got
out
maybe
fifteen
seconds
of
transmission
said
bors
somberly
which
may
or
may
not
be
picked
up
from
this
distance
and
may
or
may
not
tell
anything
he
got
a
tape
ready
while
he
was
in
overdrive
with
plenty
of
time
for
the
job
my
guess
is
that
he
take
at
least
fifteen
seconds
to
identify
his
ship
give
her
code
number
her
skipper
and
such
things
i
hope
so
but
for
minutes
he
was
irresolute
he
send
his
own
minutely
detailed
report
back
to
glamis
on
the
second
captured
ship
he
did
not
need
to
return
to
report
in
person
he
had
yet
sent
back
provisions
enough
for
the
intended
voyage
of
the
fleet
the
solar
system
of
mekin
was
an
especially
for
such
marauders
as
bors
and
his
crew
declared
themselves
to
be
so
long
as
word
did
not
get
to
ground
on
mekin
but
it
did
not
get
down
from
time
to
time
at
intervals
of
a
few
hours
specks
appeared
in
emptiness
mekin
monopolized
the
trade
of
its
satellite
world
there
would
be
many
times
the
here
that
would
be
found
off
any
other
planet
in
the
mekinese
empire
one
ship
got
to
ground
unchallenged
by
pure
accident
it
came
out
of
overdrive
within
half
a
million
miles
of
mekin
to
have
attacked
it
would
have
been
noted
but
he
got
two
more
then
he
found
the
alongside
a
but
it
could
be
allowed
to
ground
to
report
that
it
had
been
stopped
by
an
armed
ship
a
took
it
off
to
glamis
bors
made
a
formal
announcement
to
his
crew
i
think
he
told
them
over
the
circuit
that
we
got
the
ship
which
could
have
reported
our
action
off
meriden
i
sure
we
sent
four
shiploads
of
food
back
to
the
fleet
besides
the
we
rather
have
missed
but
there
still
something
to
be
done
to
confuse
mekin
and
keep
it
busy
and
therefore
off
kandar
neck
we
have
to
start
trouble
elsewhere
from
now
on
we
are
pirates
pure
and
simple
and
he
headed
the
for
the
planet
cassis
which
was
another
victim
of
the
mekinese
it
was
a
rocky
mountainous
world
with
many
mines
mekin
depended
on
it
for
metal
in
vast
quantities
the
hovered
over
it
and
sent
down
a
sardonic
challenge
one
missile
came
up
in
defiance
but
it
was
badly
aimed
and
bors
ignored
it
then
voices
called
to
him
sharp
with
excitement
he
heard
shots
and
shouting
and
a
voice
said
feverishly
that
rebels
on
cassis
who
had
been
fighting
in
the
streets
had
rushed
a
transmitter
to
welcome
the
enemies
of
mekin
bors
had
one
light
cruiser
and
merely
a
minimum
crew
for
it
he
be
of
much
help
to
insurrectionists
then
he
heard
over
the
communicator
and
voices
gasped
that
the
mekinese
garrison
was
charging
out
of
its
encampment
bors
sent
down
a
missile
to
break
the
back
of
the
then
the
communicator
gave
off
the
sound
of
gunfire
and
men
in
battle
and
presently
yells
of
triumph
he
took
the
away
its
arrival
and
involvement
in
the
revolt
was
pure
accident
it
was
no
part
of
any
plan
but
he
was
wryly
relieved
when
he
had
convinced
himself
that
mekin
needed
the
products
of
this
world
too
much
to
exterminate
its
population
with
more
days
of
travel
in
overdrive
tedium
bors
was
astounded
and
appalled
interference
here
would
only
make
matters
worse
the
went
on
there
was
a
aground
on
dover
and
the
threatened
bombs
and
a
went
down
and
brought
it
up
that
ship
also
went
away
to
glamis
where
the
fleet
was
accumulating
an
inconvenient
number
of
prisoners
the
fact
that
the
capture
of
this
ship
only
added
to
that
number
made
bors
realize
that
king
humphrey
would
be
especially
disturbed
about
the
passengers
on
the
liner
sent
back
from
mekin
unless
they
were
murdered
sooner
or
later
they
would
reveal
the
facts
about
the
fleet
and
king
humphrey
was
a
highly
conscientious
man
there
was
dissention
even
on
dover
the
was
cheered
from
the
edge
of
the
spaceport
bors
could
not
understand
he
tried
to
guess
what
was
going
on
in
the
mekinese
empire
he
could
not
know
whether
or
not
disaster
had
yet
struck
kandar
he
could
only
hope
that
there
were
ships
lurking
near
it
ready
to
use
the
recent
technical
combat
improvements
against
any
single
mekinese
ship
that
might
appear
so
no
report
would
be
carried
back
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
utter
and
complete
catastrophe
was
inevitable
he
reflected
unhappily
about
tralee
and
wondered
what
the
pretender
his
uncle
really
thought
about
his
loosing
of
missiles
against
puppet
government
buildings
there
he
found
himself
worrying
again
about
the
truck
drivers
who
warned
his
men
of
in
the
supplies
they
delivered
he
hoped
they
had
been
caught
the
arrived
at
deccan
and
called
down
the
savage
message
of
challenge
there
came
a
tumultuous
roaring
reply
bors
cried
a
voice
from
the
ground
exultantly
and
welcome
we
did
hope
you
come
here
but
you
a
thousand
times
welcome
we
smashed
the
garrison
here
captain
we
rose
days
ago
and
we
hold
the
planet
we
join
you
come
to
ground
sir
we
can
supply
you
bors
went
tense
all
over
he
been
called
by
name
if
he
was
known
by
name
on
world
twenty
from
mekin
and
from
kandar
then
everything
was
lost
can
you
send
up
a
he
asked
in
a
voice
he
did
not
recognize
i
like
to
have
your
news
it
must
be
a
trap
it
was
possible
that
there
been
revolt
on
deccan
he
found
proof
of
rebellion
elsewhere
there
been
claims
of
revolt
on
cassis
but
he
had
been
suspicious
then
he
sent
down
a
missile
to
help
the
rebels
there
now
he
wondered
desperately
if
he
been
tricked
there
as
it
was
all
too
likely
he
would
be
here
there
been
reported
fighting
on
avino
there
was
cheering
for
his
men
on
dover
and
he
might
have
landed
there
but
there
were
too
many
coincidences
far
too
many
he
waited
fifty
thousand
miles
high
with
the
ship
at
he
felt
cold
all
over
somehow
news
had
preceded
him
it
was
garbled
truth
but
there
was
enough
to
make
his
spine
feel
like
ice
he
spoke
over
the
in
a
voice
he
could
not
keep
steady
by
any
effort
of
will
all
hands
attention
he
said
heavily
i
just
called
ground
we
have
had
a
reply
calling
me
by
name
you
will
see
the
implication
it
looks
like
somehow
the
mekinese
have
managed
to
send
word
ahead
of
us
found
out
that
no
one
can
stand
against
us
they
know
we
have
new
and
deadly
weapons
probably
there
have
been
orders
given
to
lure
us
to
ground
by
the
pretense
of
a
successful
revolt
it
would
be
hoped
that
we
can
be
fooled
to
the
point
where
we
will
land
and
our
ship
can
be
captured
that
the
way
it
looks
he
swallowed
with
difficulty
if
that
so
he
said
after
an
instant
you
can
guess
what
been
done
about
kandar
the
grand
fleet
was
assembled
on
mekin
it
could
have
gone
to
kandar
he
swallowed
again
then
he
said
savagely
well
make
sure
first
if
the
worst
has
happened
we
take
our
fleet
and
head
for
mekin
and
pour
down
every
ounce
of
atomic
explosive
we
got
we
may
not
be
able
to
turn
its
air
to
poison
but
if
there
are
survivors
they
wo
celebrate
what
they
did
to
kandar
he
clicked
off
his
fists
clenched
he
paced
back
and
forth
in
the
control
room
he
almost
did
not
wait
to
make
sure
almost
but
he
had
never
seen
a
mekinese
fighting
man
face
to
face
he
gone
into
exile
with
his
uncle
when
that
unhappily
reasonable
man
let
tralee
surrender
rather
than
be
bombed
to
depopulation
he
served
in
the
kandarian
navy
without
ever
managing
to
be
in
any
port
when
a
mekinese
ship
was
in
he
fought
in
the
battle
off
kandar
he
destroyed
a
mekinese
cruiser
off
tralee
another
in
the
mekinese
system
itself
and
a
squadron
off
meriden
but
he
had
never
seen
a
mekinese
face
to
face
filled
with
such
hatred
as
he
felt
he
meant
to
do
so
now
a
came
up
from
the
ground
the
trained
weapons
on
it
bors
painstakingly
arranged
for
its
occupants
to
board
the
in
which
could
not
conceal
bombs
there
were
six
men
in
the
they
came
into
the
control
room
and
he
saw
that
they
were
young
almost
boys
when
they
learned
that
he
was
captain
bors
they
looked
at
him
with
shining
admiring
worshipping
eyes
it
could
not
be
a
trick
it
could
not
be
a
trap
he
was
incredulous
the
message
from
the
ground
was
true
chapter
the
news
as
bors
got
it
from
the
men
of
deccan
was
remarkable
for
two
reasons
that
so
much
of
it
was
true
and
that
all
of
it
was
glamorized
and
romanticized
and
garbled
it
was
astonishing
to
find
any
relation
at
all
between
such
fabulously
romantic
tales
and
the
facts
because
there
was
no
way
for
news
to
travel
between
solar
systems
except
on
ships
and
no
ships
had
carried
stories
like
these
here
on
deccan
the
young
men
that
bors
had
landed
on
tralee
and
on
garen
they
that
there
was
a
fleet
in
being
which
had
fought
and
annihilated
a
mekinese
many
times
its
size
to
the
captain
their
knowledge
was
undiluted
catastrophe
they
admired
bors
because
they
believed
he
commanded
that
fleet
which
he
now
had
in
hiding
while
he
flashed
splendidly
about
the
subjugated
worlds
performing
prodigious
feats
of
valor
and
destruction
half
pirate
and
half
hero
the
story
had
it
that
he
been
driven
from
his
native
tralee
by
the
invaders
and
that
now
he
fought
mekin
in
magnificent
and
that
it
was
who
set
alight
the
flame
of
rebellion
on
so
many
worlds
bors
listened
and
was
numbed
he
heard
references
to
the
fight
off
meriden
and
the
temporary
escape
of
one
of
his
enemies
and
that
pursued
it
to
the
solar
system
of
mekin
itself
and
there
destroyed
it
while
mekin
watched
helpless
to
interfere
the
distortion
of
facts
was
astounding
but
the
mere
existence
of
facts
at
this
distance
was
impossible
then
bors
found
himself
thinking
that
these
tales
sounded
like
fantasies
or
daydreams
and
he
went
white
he
knew
what
had
happened
just
before
he
left
the
fleet
he
talked
to
a
fat
woman
and
a
scowling
man
who
together
made
up
the
talents
incorporated
brand
new
department
for
disseminating
truthful
seditious
rumors
so
that
rumors
of
a
high
degree
of
detail
got
started
nobody
knew
how
if
such
rumors
spread
and
everybody
heard
them
nobody
would
doubt
them
it
was
appallingly
probable
that
the
fighting
on
cassis
and
avino
and
deccan
had
no
greater
justification
in
reason
than
that
an
enormously
fat
woman
romantically
pictured
such
things
as
resulting
from
the
of
one
captain
bors
of
whom
she
thought
sentimentally
and
glamorously
and
without
much
discrimination
but
she
daydreamed
about
the
fleet
too
and
that
it
had
destroyed
a
mekinese
squadron
many
times
its
size
he
heard
the
leader
of
the
young
men
from
deccan
speaking
humorously
your
revolt
sir
he
told
bors
is
spreading
everywhere
on
cela
sir
there
are
great
yards
where
they
build
craft
for
the
mekinese
navy
not
long
ago
they
finished
one
and
it
went
out
to
space
for
a
trial
run
it
did
come
back
sabotage
everybody
knew
it
the
mekinese
raged
a
little
while
later
they
finished
another
ship
but
the
mekinese
were
smart
they
sent
it
off
for
its
trial
run
with
only
celans
on
board
if
there
were
sabotage
this
time
it
would
be
mekinese
who
died
in
space
but
that
ship
did
come
back
either
it
touched
down
here
sir
three
weeks
ago
and
we
supplied
it
with
food
and
missiles
and
some
of
us
joined
it
it
went
off
to
try
to
find
you
i
better
go
after
it
said
bors
it
could
blunder
into
trouble
at
best
the
youthful
leader
of
deccan
revolt
grinned
widely
it
got
plenty
of
missiles
he
told
bors
it
can
take
care
of
itself
and
it
has
plenty
of
food
we
even
gave
them
to
practice
launching
missiles
on
we
been
storing
up
missiles
to
lay
an
ambush
for
a
mekinese
squadron
if
one
comes
by
a
lot
of
us
joined
the
ship
though
in
any
case
said
bors
with
the
feel
of
ashes
in
his
throat
track
it
down
so
it
can
join
the
fleet
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
tell
these
confident
and
admiring
young
men
that
there
was
no
hope
and
never
had
been
that
the
tales
of
his
achievements
were
only
partly
true
and
that
they
had
popped
into
people
minds
because
a
very
fat
woman
far
away
indulged
in
daydreams
and
fantasies
they
would
have
understood
if
they
had
they
would
have
believed
he
found
that
he
savagely
resisted
the
conviction
himself
but
there
was
no
other
way
for
such
garbled
tales
with
such
a
substratum
of
fact
to
be
spread
among
the
stars
and
whoever
spread
them
knew
of
events
up
to
the
last
news
sent
back
by
bors
but
nothing
after
that
undoubtedly
talents
incorporated
department
for
disseminating
truthful
seditious
rumors
had
been
at
work
on
mekin
but
the
damage
done
elsewhere
was
a
thousand
times
greater
than
any
benefit
done
there
it
was
too
late
to
repair
the
damage
here
or
anywhere
else
this
planet
and
all
the
rest
were
too
far
committed
to
rebellion
ever
to
be
forgiven
by
mekin
mekin
would
take
revenge
it
was
not
pleasant
to
think
about
so
the
departed
and
traveled
in
overdrive
for
seemingly
without
end
toward
glamis
it
knew
nothing
that
happened
outside
its
own
cocoon
of
overdrive
field
it
knew
nothing
of
any
of
the
thousands
of
myriads
of
stars
whose
planetary
systems
offered
unlimited
room
for
humanity
to
live
in
freedom
and
without
fear
during
the
journey
bors
only
endured
being
alive
all
this
disaster
was
ultimately
his
fault
the
fleet
survival
was
due
to
his
work
with
talents
incorporated
the
raids
of
a
single
ship
which
now
would
have
such
disastrous
results
were
the
fruits
of
his
suggestion
the
consequence
of
his
actions
talents
incorporated
was
involved
to
be
sure
but
only
because
allowed
it
to
be
he
should
have
realized
that
madame
porvis
would
work
havoc
if
her
talent
was
as
described
no
mere
romantic
daydreamer
would
fashion
fantasies
with
military
secrecy
in
mind
and
security
as
a
principle
everything
was
betrayed
everything
was
ruined
and
if
he
bors
had
only
been
properly
skeptical
the
fleet
would
have
been
destroyed
and
kandar
now
occupied
by
the
mekinese
doomed
to
servitude
but
not
necessarily
to
annihilation
and
other
worlds
would
also
be
safely
servile
they
still
be
resentful
and
they
bitterly
hate
mekin
but
they
would
not
have
before
them
the
monstrous
vengeance
now
in
store
bors
in
fact
felt
guilty
because
he
was
still
alive
there
was
only
one
small
thing
he
could
still
try
to
set
aright
he
could
insist
that
morgan
take
gwenlyn
far
away
from
the
dangerous
possibility
that
mekin
might
somehow
find
her
he
to
make
morgan
see
the
need
for
it
if
necessary
he
would
convince
king
humphrey
that
a
royal
order
must
be
issued
to
send
the
away
before
the
mekinese
empire
began
to
restore
itself
to
devastated
calm
if
that
process
had
already
begun
mekin
had
its
grand
fleet
assembled
and
ready
if
convincing
and
unfortunately
truthful
rumors
ran
about
mekin
as
elsewhere
concerning
the
fleet
and
bors
attempts
to
hide
it
then
their
dictator
need
only
give
a
single
order
and
the
grand
fleet
would
lift
off
when
it
found
kandar
unoccupied
it
would
leave
kandar
dead
then
it
would
seek
out
the
fleet
and
destroy
it
and
then
it
would
move
from
one
to
another
of
its
rebellious
tributaries
and
take
revenge
upon
them
and
bors
could
only
hope
to
salvage
the
life
of
one
girl
from
the
wreckage
of
everything
that
human
beings
prefer
to
believe
in
he
could
only
hope
to
send
gwenlyn
away
if
he
was
not
already
too
late
the
broke
out
into
normal
space
twelve
days
after
leaving
deccan
the
untrustworthy
sun
of
glamis
still
shone
brightly
the
inner
planet
revolved
about
it
with
one
side
glowing
low
red
heat
and
the
other
side
piled
high
with
frozen
atmosphere
the
useless
outer
planet
remained
a
lush
green
save
for
its
seas
and
the
fleet
still
circled
it
from
pole
to
pole
bors
had
himself
ferried
to
the
flagship
by
because
what
he
had
to
report
was
too
disheartening
to
be
spoken
where
all
the
fleet
might
hear
gwenlyn
met
him
at
the
flagship
airlock
she
looked
very
glad
as
if
she
been
uneasy
about
him
call
for
a
boat
bors
commanded
her
curtly
to
take
you
to
the
go
on
board
with
anybody
else
who
belongs
on
it
your
father
anybody
i
going
to
ask
the
king
to
insist
that
the
get
away
from
here
fast
before
the
mekinese
turn
up
gwenlyn
shook
her
head
her
eyes
searching
his
face
the
not
here
it
gone
to
kandar
as
a
sort
of
bors
groaned
then
i
try
to
get
another
ship
assigned
to
take
you
away
he
said
formidably
maybe
one
of
the
captured
i
sent
back
no
said
gwenlyn
they
going
to
be
released
they
go
to
mekin
and
we
go
there
bors
groaned
again
then
he
said
savagely
wait
here
for
me
arrange
something
as
soon
as
i
seen
the
king
he
strode
down
the
corridor
to
king
humphrey
cabin
a
sentry
came
to
attention
bors
passed
through
a
door
the
king
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
officers
of
the
fleet
were
listening
apathetically
to
morgan
at
once
vexed
and
positive
and
uncertain
but
you
ca
ignore
it
protested
morgan
i
do
understand
it
either
but
you
agree
that
since
my
precognizer
said
no
ship
but
bors
is
coming
here
and
he
precognized
every
one
of
the
prizes
before
they
arrived
you
concede
that
the
mekinese
are
coming
here
so
you
going
out
to
meet
them
he
saw
bors
and
breathed
an
audible
sigh
of
relief
bors
he
said
in
a
changed
tone
i
glad
you
back
bors
said
grimly
majesty
i
very
bad
news
king
humphrey
shrugged
he
spoke
in
a
listless
voice
i
doubt
it
differs
from
ours
you
captured
a
off
mekin
you
will
remember
you
sent
it
here
when
it
arrived
we
found
that
all
its
passengers
knew
that
kandar
was
not
occupied
and
that
the
fleet
sent
to
capture
it
had
not
reported
back
my
news
is
worse
said
bors
the
continued
existence
of
our
fleet
and
the
fact
that
it
defeated
a
mekinese
force
is
common
knowledge
on
at
least
five
planets
all
of
them
now
in
revolt
against
mekin
the
king
expression
had
reached
the
limit
of
reaction
to
disaster
it
did
not
change
he
looked
almost
apathetic
mekin
he
said
dully
sent
a
second
squadron
to
kandar
to
investigate
the
rumors
of
defeat
we
have
a
very
tiny
force
there
three
ships
of
course
our
ships
wo
attack
the
mekinese
but
they
might
as
well
knowing
that
we
destroyed
their
first
fleet
and
that
we
still
live
mekin
will
assuredly
retaliate
and
not
only
on
kandar
said
bors
on
tralee
and
garen
and
cassis
and
meriden
morgan
interrupted
majesty
all
this
is
more
reason
to
listen
to
me
i
been
telling
you
that
all
my
talents
agree
king
humphrey
interrupted
tonelessly
we
made
our
final
arrangements
bors
we
are
going
to
release
the
and
the
you
sent
us
we
will
use
them
as
messengers
we
are
going
to
send
a
message
of
surrender
to
mekin
bors
swallowed
his
most
dismal
forebodings
had
produced
nothing
more
hopeless
than
this
moment
majesty
we
have
to
sacrifice
said
the
king
in
a
leaden
voice
not
only
our
lives
but
our
to
try
to
gain
something
less
than
the
total
annihilation
of
kandar
we
shall
tell
the
mekinese
that
we
will
return
to
kandar
and
form
up
in
space
if
they
send
a
small
force
to
accept
our
surrender
they
shall
have
it
if
they
prefer
to
destroy
us
they
can
do
that
also
but
we
submit
ourselves
to
punishment
for
having
resisted
the
original
fleet
we
admit
our
guilt
and
we
beg
mekin
not
to
avenge
that
resistance
upon
our
people
who
are
not
guilty
bors
tried
to
speak
and
could
not
there
was
a
sodden
utterly
unresilient
stillness
in
the
room
as
if
all
the
high
officers
of
the
fleet
were
corpses
and
the
king
himself
though
he
spoke
was
not
less
dead
then
morgan
moved
decisively
he
moved
away
from
the
spot
where
he
had
been
engaged
in
impassioned
argument
he
took
bors
by
the
arm
and
hustled
him
through
the
door
come
along
he
said
urgently
something
got
to
be
done
you
have
the
knack
of
thinking
of
things
to
do
the
king
intentions
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
he
broke
off
he
wiped
sweat
from
his
forehead
with
one
hand
while
he
thrust
bors
on
with
the
other
they
came
to
a
cabin
evidently
assigned
to
him
gwenlyn
waited
there
craziness
said
morgan
bitterly
craziness
i
get
the
finest
group
of
talents
that
ever
existed
i
teach
them
to
think
i
instruct
them
and
they
ca
think
of
what
is
going
to
happen
and
everything
depends
on
it
everything
when
will
the
be
back
demanded
bors
morgan
automatically
looked
at
his
watch
gwenlyn
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
morgan
shook
his
head
impatiently
gwenlyn
was
silent
my
talent
with
the
said
morgan
harassedly
we
sent
him
to
kandar
to
find
out
if
the
mekinese
fleet
coming
there
and
when
it
is
coming
here
he
said
so
it
go
to
kandar
said
bors
bitterly
to
destroy
it
i
imagine
we
go
there
too
to
be
destroyed
but
it
insane
protested
morgan
look
you
captured
a
off
mekin
right
yes
you
sent
it
here
with
all
its
passengers
right
yes
one
of
the
passengers
said
he
was
a
clairvoyant
hah
morgan
expressed
the
ultimate
of
disgust
he
was
a
he
did
know
there
was
anything
better
than
that
a
but
he
a
talent
a
born
charlatan
but
he
an
authentic
talent
and
he
does
know
what
that
is
he
thinks
predictions
as
madame
porvis
thinks
scandals
and
they
just
as
crazy
but
he
a
talent
and
they
have
to
be
right
bors
said
you
going
to
take
gwenlyn
away
from
here
and
fast
morgan
paid
no
attention
he
was
embittered
and
agitated
and
in
particular
he
was
frustrated
it
all
madness
he
protested
almost
hysterically
here
we
got
a
firm
precognition
that
king
humphrey
going
to
open
parliament
on
kandar
next
year
and
there
another
one
gwenlyn
said
quickly
which
you
wo
tell
which
i
wo
tell
but
something
got
to
happen
something
got
to
be
done
and
this
crazy
talent
gives
me
a
crazy
precognition
and
looks
proud
because
i
ca
make
sense
of
it
what
the
hell
can
you
make
out
of
a
precognition
that
mekin
will
be
defeated
when
an
enemy
fleet
submits
to
destruction
lying
still
in
space
there
no
sense
to
it
talents
would
think
of
anything
idiotic
like
that
they
got
better
sense
but
when
this
lunatic
said
it
they
could
precognize
it
too
it
so
they
could
think
of
it
themselves
but
when
this
mekinese
talent
does
they
know
it
true
but
it
ca
be
bors
said
coldly
the
fleet
going
to
be
destroyed
certainly
if
that
will
defeat
mekin
but
gwenlyn
is
not
to
stay
aboard
to
be
destroyed
with
it
how
are
you
going
to
get
her
away
the
king
waiting
for
the
to
come
back
morgan
said
indignantly
so
he
know
my
talent
went
to
find
out
if
the
mekin
fleet
going
to
kandar
and
when
he
insists
that
if
they
know
the
fleet
exists
they
know
where
it
is
and
will
come
here
looking
for
it
but
madame
porvis
could
have
told
that
in
her
daydreaming
she
did
what
planet
we
circling
she
could
have
spread
that
fact
by
contagion
she
spread
plenty
more
said
bors
her
daydreams
were
too
damned
true
gwenlyn
said
it
a
contradiction
in
terms
for
a
fleet
to
win
a
battle
by
letting
itself
be
destroyed
perhaps
the
captain
it
also
a
contradiction
in
terms
said
bors
bitterly
for
all
our
troubles
to
come
because
we
won
a
victory
now
we
regret
that
we
all
killed
but
it
madness
for
the
king
to
propose
to
get
us
all
slaughtered
in
hope
of
rousing
the
mekinese
better
nature
maybe
you
can
resolve
it
captain
said
gwenlyn
thoughtfully
could
it
be
that
it
is
a
contradiction
but
only
a
paradox
bors
spread
his
hands
helplessly
of
all
times
and
circumstances
this
particular
moment
and
situation
seemed
the
least
occasion
for
quibbling
over
words
then
he
said
yes
it
could
be
a
paradox
if
this
prediction
by
that
wild
talent
is
true
there
is
a
way
it
could
win
a
fight
i
believe
it
but
i
going
to
put
something
in
motion
nothing
can
make
matters
worse
he
turned
and
strode
back
to
the
council
room
where
king
humphrey
and
the
high
commanders
of
his
fleet
sat
like
dead
men
waiting
for
the
moment
to
be
killed
to
no
purpose
chapter
bors
got
nowhere
of
course
his
proposal
had
all
the
of
lunacy
of
purest
ray
serene
he
proposed
urgently
to
equip
all
the
ships
of
the
fleet
with
the
overdrive
fields
it
could
be
done
in
days
instructions
were
already
distributed
and
would
have
been
studied
and
understood
the
fleet
would
then
go
to
kandar
if
it
appeared
that
the
mekinese
grand
fleet
would
go
there
and
set
up
a
dummy
fleet
of
in
war
array
this
would
be
a
fleet
but
not
of
fighting
ships
it
would
be
a
fleet
of
inflated
balloons
one
actual
fighting
ship
he
stipulated
would
form
part
of
this
illusory
he
volunteered
the
for
it
that
ship
would
signal
to
the
mekinese
when
they
arrived
it
would
make
the
proposal
to
surrender
on
the
mekinese
promise
to
spare
the
civilian
population
of
kandar
if
the
enemy
admiral
agreed
to
these
terms
and
the
king
believed
him
then
the
true
kandarian
fleet
could
appear
and
yield
to
its
enemy
if
the
admiral
arrogantly
refused
to
pledge
safety
to
kandar
population
then
the
dummy
formation
might
be
destroyed
but
the
fleet
would
fight
hopelessly
and
uselessly
though
the
new
drive
worked
well
in
action
but
it
would
fight
the
first
admiral
said
stonily
if
i
were
in
the
position
of
the
mekinese
admiral
and
i
agreed
to
terms
of
capitulation
and
if
it
were
then
shown
to
me
that
the
basis
of
the
terms
was
a
deceit
i
would
not
feel
bound
by
my
promise
when
the
actual
fleet
appeared
i
would
blast
it
for
questioning
my
honor
bors
looked
at
him
with
hot
eyes
the
king
said
drearily
no
bors
we
must
act
in
good
faith
we
can
not
question
the
mekinese
good
faith
as
you
propose
and
then
expect
them
to
believe
in
ours
the
admiral
is
right
we
can
fight
and
bring
destruction
on
our
people
or
we
can
place
ourselves
at
the
mercy
of
mekin
there
can
be
only
one
choice
we
sacrifice
ourselves
but
we
keep
our
honor
i
deny
said
bors
savagely
that
any
man
keeps
his
honor
who
enslaves
his
fellows
as
you
will
do
in
surrendering
i
resign
my
commission
in
your
service
majesty
king
humphrey
nodded
wearily
very
well
you
have
served
us
admirably
bors
i
wish
i
thought
you
were
right
in
this
matter
i
would
rather
follow
your
advice
than
my
convictions
your
resignation
is
accepted
an
hour
later
fuming
bors
paced
back
and
forth
across
the
floor
of
a
cabin
in
the
flagship
the
pretender
of
tralee
entered
the
older
man
looked
wryly
amused
it
was
a
most
improper
thing
to
do
you
resigned
your
commission
and
then
ordered
the
fields
built
on
all
ships
to
the
contrary
said
bors
i
spread
the
news
that
i
had
resigned
my
commission
the
fields
were
to
be
installed
to
give
us
a
fighting
chance
the
pretender
sat
down
and
regarded
his
nephew
quizzically
but
is
it
so
important
to
use
tables
of
calculations
instead
of
computers
yes
said
bors
it
is
important
i
should
know
i
used
the
fields
in
combat
nobody
else
has
the
old
man
said
without
reproof
the
first
admiral
is
indignant
the
fields
were
not
ordered
on
the
ground
that
they
an
untested
device
and
that
at
least
once
such
a
field
blew
out
leaving
your
ship
the
so
helpless
that
it
had
to
be
abandoned
true
agreed
bors
he
made
no
defense
the
attitude
of
the
first
admiral
would
have
been
perfectly
logical
in
ordinary
times
anything
like
the
new
intermediate
overdrive
field
should
have
been
proposed
through
channels
examined
by
a
commission
of
officers
reported
on
the
report
evaluated
and
then
painstaking
and
lengthy
tests
made
and
the
report
on
the
tests
evaluated
then
it
should
have
been
submitted
to
another
commission
of
officers
of
higher
rank
who
would
estimate
the
kind
and
amount
of
modification
of
standard
equipment
the
new
device
required
its
susceptibility
to
accident
obsolescence
the
ease
of
repair
the
cost
of
installation
and
the
length
of
time
required
to
install
it
somewhere
along
the
line
there
should
also
have
been
a
report
on
the
ease
with
which
it
could
be
integrated
into
other
apparatus
and
standard
operational
procedures
and
there
should
have
been
reports
on
its
possible
tactical
value
the
probable
number
of
times
it
would
be
useful
the
degree
of
its
utility
and
whether
the
excessive
discomfort
of
going
into
and
out
of
overdrive
at
extremely
short
intervals
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
crew
morale
under
normal
circumstances
a
ship
might
have
been
equipped
for
testing
purposes
in
six
to
ten
years
and
in
ten
years
more
all
new
ships
might
be
equipped
but
it
would
be
well
over
a
generation
before
its
use
was
general
the
older
man
said
since
your
resignation
been
accepted
you
be
put
on
the
when
it
comes
back
you
wo
be
taken
to
kandar
with
the
fleet
bors
hands
clenched
they
say
i
resigned
to
stay
out
of
the
fight
no
said
his
uncle
mildly
they
say
you
resigned
to
avoid
surrender
i
being
evicted
with
you
i
to
be
dumped
on
the
hospitality
of
your
friend
morgan
too
humphrey
is
a
very
kindly
man
abominably
so
but
i
am
tired
of
being
an
exile
i
really
rather
stay
with
the
fleet
but
he
stands
on
his
dignity
to
preserve
our
lives
not
sure
what
for
in
a
universe
where
such
things
as
mekin
can
happen
they
happen
growled
bors
because
we
value
peace
and
quiet
as
much
as
the
mekinese
do
power
and
much
less
than
freedom
we
compromise
he
paced
up
and
down
up
to
now
he
said
harshly
every
effort
made
against
mekin
has
been
defensive
worlds
in
turn
have
fallen
because
they
only
wanted
to
mekin
it
time
for
some
world
to
resolve
very
solidly
to
mekin
to
act
with
honest
anger
against
a
thing
that
should
be
hated
it
got
to
be
done
the
time
for
such
a
resolution
said
his
uncle
gently
went
by
long
ago
there
was
sudden
voice
from
the
compartment
speaker
there
was
the
hissing
sound
of
doors
closing
the
silence
of
a
closed
compartment
fell
the
pretender
said
quietly
if
this
is
the
mekinese
fleet
everything
is
solved
but
your
friends
of
talents
incorporated
will
have
to
be
wrong
they
insist
the
grand
fleet
will
not
come
here
bors
rasped
i
wish
i
were
in
that
control
room
but
at
least
we
got
missiles
they
ca
intercept
except
that
they
wo
be
fired
they
a
great
improvement
the
pretender
said
mildly
he
sat
at
ease
time
passed
presently
the
tiny
compartment
hummed
bringing
down
the
co
content
of
the
air
it
cut
off
bors
paced
up
and
down
up
and
down
he
pictured
what
might
be
happening
outside
it
could
be
that
the
grand
fleet
of
mekin
had
appeared
and
now
drove
proudly
toward
glamis
it
could
be
that
the
fleet
was
offering
surrender
there
would
be
on
many
of
its
ships
there
would
be
monumental
frustration
junior
officers
in
particular
would
have
examined
the
overdrive
tables
and
would
have
studied
longingly
the
reports
of
bors
use
of
overdrive
against
an
enemy
squadron
off
meriden
they
would
yearn
passionately
to
have
their
ships
equipped
with
apparatus
by
which
it
could
vanish
from
a
place
where
it
was
a
target
to
reappear
elsewhere
unharmed
and
make
the
enemy
its
target
two
fleets
equipped
with
the
new
device
might
checkmate
each
other
but
one
fleet
the
speaker
said
curtly
bors
a
single
ship
has
broken
out
of
overdrive
it
identifies
itself
as
the
liberty
cela
it
declares
that
it
has
come
to
place
itself
under
your
bors
stared
he
had
forgotten
about
the
two
ships
which
the
deccan
rebels
told
him
about
the
first
of
which
had
gone
on
a
trial
run
with
a
mekinese
crew
and
failed
to
return
and
the
second
of
which
with
a
celan
crew
had
gone
off
to
look
for
bors
and
his
marauders
somehow
it
had
found
him
it
seemed
totally
improbable
bors
instantly
thought
of
talents
incorporated
the
talents
on
the
ship
had
spread
rebellion
on
worlds
unthinkable
distances
apart
it
was
conceivable
that
in
some
way
they
brought
this
ship
to
glamis
very
well
said
bors
coldly
in
the
cabin
to
which
he
was
confined
i
request
to
be
put
on
board
i
come
with
you
said
his
uncle
he
smiled
at
bors
who
noted
but
was
not
surprised
at
the
genuineness
of
the
smile
this
is
the
ship
you
mentioned
as
hoping
to
emulate
the
i
do
think
surrender
it
but
i
surrendered
once
and
i
do
like
it
i
rather
not
do
it
again
went
back
to
normal
as
went
off
morgan
appeared
agitated
and
upset
what
this
he
demanded
what
happened
bors
told
him
curtly
as
much
as
he
knew
all
that
he
been
told
on
deccan
it
was
the
only
ship
technically
in
actual
rebellion
against
mekin
it
had
heard
rumors
of
bors
and
it
wanted
his
leadership
but
you
ca
go
now
insisted
morgan
you
got
to
wait
until
the
gets
back
you
have
to
have
talents
incorporated
information
to
act
on
you
need
my
talents
i
going
to
get
moving
as
fast
as
i
can
said
bors
i
do
think
we
can
wait
if
the
what
i
think
and
her
crew
what
i
believe
they
crave
action
there
was
a
at
the
flagship
lock
bors
and
his
uncle
entered
those
already
in
the
boat
were
young
men
in
the
nondescript
clothing
of
they
grinned
proudly
at
bors
when
he
took
his
seat
i
do
know
whether
you
know
sir
said
the
young
man
at
the
controls
but
we
heard
about
your
revolt
sir
and
we
were
about
at
the
limit
so
we
i
stopped
at
deccan
bors
said
briefly
they
told
me
about
you
do
you
want
action
against
mekin
yes
sir
it
was
a
chorus
you
get
it
said
bors
i
try
you
out
on
a
concentration
of
mekin
ships
that
should
be
turning
up
at
kandar
how
are
you
equipped
for
repairs
and
changes
we
left
cela
for
a
test
trip
sir
said
the
young
man
at
the
controls
there
were
grins
behind
him
he
chuckled
naturally
we
had
materials
to
repair
anything
that
went
wrong
on
a
trial
run
i
got
some
new
settings
for
missiles
said
bors
which
make
them
hard
to
dodge
and
we
want
to
set
up
a
special
overdrive
control
which
makes
it
easy
to
dodge
mekinese
ones
we
can
attend
to
it
on
the
way
to
kandar
how
many
aboard
he
asked
other
curt
questions
they
answered
what
bors
asked
was
what
a
commanding
officer
would
need
to
know
about
a
new
ship
and
his
new
followers
realized
it
they
had
been
exultant
and
triumphant
when
he
entered
the
in
the
brief
time
needed
to
get
to
the
they
became
ardently
confident
his
reception
was
undisciplined
but
enthusiastic
he
made
a
hurried
inspection
the
had
started
out
with
a
skeleton
crew
of
shipyard
workers
and
no
stores
or
arms
the
ranks
were
now
filled
with
volunteers
from
deccan
and
elsewhere
and
its
fairly
bulged
with
foodstuffs
bors
however
really
relaxed
only
once
that
was
when
he
saw
the
filled
racks
of
missiles
on
deccan
they
been
lavish
in
their
gifts
to
the
rebel
bors
went
into
the
control
room
glanced
about
and
spoke
crisply
into
the
microphone
all
hands
attention
bors
speaking
a
concentration
of
mekinese
ships
is
expected
at
kandar
we
shall
head
for
that
planet
immediately
on
the
way
i
shall
arrange
for
some
changes
in
the
settings
of
the
missiles
we
have
on
board
we
will
fix
and
distribute
for
their
use
we
will
stop
twice
on
the
way
for
target
practice
much
more
than
your
lives
or
mine
depends
on
how
well
you
do
your
work
we
also
modify
the
overdrive
to
make
this
ship
able
to
do
everything
my
other
ships
did
and
more
you
will
work
much
harder
on
the
way
to
kandar
than
you
ever
worked
before
but
we
have
to
accomplish
more
than
usual
all
he
stood
by
while
the
ship
was
aimed
for
kandar
the
young
astrogator
said
enthusiastically
prepare
for
overdrive
five
four
three
a
voice
out
of
a
speaker
liberty
liberty
liberty
hold
it
said
bors
he
answered
the
call
morgan
voice
in
a
high
state
of
agitation
sylva
back
just
broke
out
the
grand
fleet
will
get
to
kandar
in
five
days
four
hours
twenty
minutes
my
talent
on
sylva
sure
of
it
it
talents
incorporated
information
we
have
any
time
to
spare
then
said
bors
panted
morgan
voice
were
three
ships
of
our
fleet
hanging
about
on
watch
for
mekinese
they
expected
one
twelve
came
the
attacked
they
got
eleven
of
the
twelve
the
last
one
went
into
overdrive
and
got
away
bors
do
you
see
what
that
means
it
means
said
bors
coldly
that
mekin
wo
be
accepting
surrenders
this
week
destroying
the
first
division
was
bad
enough
i
got
one
off
meriden
now
that
a
third
squadron
wiped
out
mekin
will
insist
on
somebody
getting
punished
and
plenty
all
right
we
leaving
for
kandar
now
he
nodded
to
the
young
man
at
the
control
board
he
noted
with
approval
that
he
kept
the
aim
exact
while
bors
talked
to
morgan
proceed
bors
ordered
the
young
man
said
five
four
three
two
one
there
was
the
familiar
dizzying
sensation
of
going
into
overdrive
the
wrapped
stressed
space
about
itself
and
went
hurtling
into
invisibility
this
was
one
voyage
in
overdrive
which
was
not
tedious
bors
had
to
organize
the
ship
for
combat
he
had
to
train
to
work
like
machinery
he
had
to
teach
the
setting
of
missiles
for
ranges
he
had
to
show
how
to
measure
once
he
stopped
the
ship
between
stars
and
all
the
took
shots
at
an
inflated
target
the
pretender
of
tralee
displayed
an
unexpected
gift
for
organization
he
divided
all
space
outside
the
ship
into
sectors
assigning
one
launcher
to
each
sector
if
an
order
to
fire
came
the
separate
crews
would
cover
targets
in
their
own
areas
first
there
would
be
no
waste
of
missiles
on
one
target
the
pretender
would
have
made
an
excellent
officer
he
was
patient
with
those
who
did
not
understand
immediately
he
had
dignity
that
was
not
arrogance
in
five
days
the
was
a
fighting
ship
and
a
dedicated
one
there
were
rough
edges
of
course
man
for
man
and
weapon
for
weapon
the
ship
would
not
compare
with
a
and
more
experienced
fighting
instrument
but
the
morale
on
board
was
superb
and
the
weapons
were
to
put
it
mildly
inspiring
of
hope
the
broke
out
of
overdrive
and
the
sun
of
kandar
shone
fiery
yellow
in
emptiness
the
planet
had
moved
in
its
orbit
it
was
more
evenly
in
line
than
before
with
a
direct
for
a
fleet
from
mekin
bors
was
worn
out
from
his
unremitting
efforts
to
turn
the
ship
into
a
unit
he
looked
at
a
ship
clock
the
mekinese
he
said
over
the
circuit
will
break
out
in
two
hours
forty
minutes
and
we
going
to
set
up
a
dummy
fleet
for
them
to
deal
with
his
uncle
said
gently
i
suggest
some
rest
to
be
fresh
for
the
handling
of
the
ship
i
set
up
the
dummy
fleet
bors
resisted
the
idea
but
it
was
not
sensible
to
humor
his
own
vanity
by
insisting
on
his
indispensability
he
flung
himself
down
on
a
bunk
he
was
much
better
satisfied
with
the
ship
and
crew
than
he
would
have
admitted
and
he
was
around
him
young
men
of
cela
and
deccan
prepared
for
launching
the
pretender
gently
pointed
out
that
the
formation
was
to
remain
perfectly
still
and
in
ranks
therefore
each
globe
had
to
be
launched
with
no
velocity
at
all
so
it
would
remain
in
fixed
position
with
relation
to
the
others
to
convincingly
appear
to
be
a
fleet
of
ships
far
away
the
hurtled
through
space
with
a
morgan
on
board
gwenlyn
too
was
frightened
for
the
first
time
both
of
them
seemed
doubtful
of
the
value
of
talents
incorporated
information
again
far
away
the
fleet
of
kandar
rushed
through
emptiness
on
its
various
ships
junior
officers
had
come
threateningly
close
to
mutiny
there
was
now
a
sullen
resigned
submission
to
discipline
and
what
orders
might
be
given
but
the
fleet
was
fighting
angry
the
had
brought
back
news
of
a
third
defeat
of
mekinese
by
kandar
ships
and
hot
blood
longed
to
make
a
test
of
its
own
deadliness
there
were
few
ships
of
the
fleet
which
did
not
have
a
overdrive
field
unit
ready
to
be
spliced
into
circuit
if
the
occasion
arose
if
the
king
could
not
make
acceptable
terms
for
surrender
the
junior
officers
were
prepared
to
make
a
victory
by
mekin
a
very
costly
matter
stretched
out
on
his
bunk
bors
thought
of
all
these
things
finally
he
slept
and
dreamed
it
was
odd
that
anyone
so
weary
should
dream
it
was
more
strange
that
he
did
not
dream
of
the
matters
in
the
forefront
of
his
mind
he
dreamed
of
gwenlyn
she
was
crying
in
the
dream
and
it
was
because
she
thought
he
was
killed
and
bors
was
astonished
at
her
grief
and
then
unbelievably
elated
and
he
moved
toward
her
and
she
raised
her
head
at
some
sound
he
made
the
expression
of
incredulous
joy
on
her
face
made
him
put
his
arms
around
her
with
an
enormous
and
unbelieving
satisfaction
and
he
kissed
her
and
the
sensation
was
remarkable
he
blinked
at
the
ceiling
of
the
control
room
of
the
his
uncle
was
saying
amiably
to
the
young
man
at
the
that
a
very
pretty
if
we
do
say
so
ourselves
bors
stood
up
of
his
mind
still
startled
by
his
dream
but
the
other
half
reverting
instantly
to
business
but
all
matters
of
business
had
been
attended
to
out
the
viewports
he
could
see
the
dummy
fleet
in
an
apparently
defensive
formation
its
ships
were
only
miles
apart
and
if
they
had
been
fighting
ships
every
one
could
have
launched
missiles
at
any
point
of
attack
from
the
pattern
they
constituted
at
a
hundred
miles
they
could
be
seen
only
as
specks
of
reflected
sunlight
at
greater
distances
a
radar
would
identify
them
only
as
dots
which
must
be
enemy
ships
because
the
they
made
lacked
the
nimbus
of
friendly
craft
hm
said
bors
he
looked
at
the
clock
the
mekinese
should
have
broken
out
five
minutes
ago
they
did
said
his
uncle
they
yonder
they
heading
straight
for
this
fleet
he
pointed
not
out
a
port
but
at
a
screen
where
a
boiling
mass
of
bright
specks
showed
the
mekinese
fleet
just
out
of
overdrive
and
speeding
toward
the
dummy
formation
sorting
itself
into
attack
formation
as
it
moved
the
king
not
here
on
time
observed
bors
grimly
we
have
to
play
his
hand
for
him
uncle
we
have
the
right
to
commit
kandar
by
beginning
to
fight
ourselves
offer
surrender
as
he
wish
it
to
be
done
if
they
accept
he
can
carry
out
his
part
when
he
arrives
be
here
the
former
monarch
spoke
gently
into
a
beam
transmitter
calling
mekinese
fleet
he
said
defending
fleet
calling
mekinese
fleet
in
seconds
a
reply
came
back
grand
admiral
calling
the
voice
answered
arrogantly
do
you
want
we
will
discuss
capitulation
on
behalf
of
kandar
said
the
old
man
will
you
give
us
terms
he
grimaced
and
said
aside
to
bors
i
speaking
for
humphrey
as
i
know
he
speak
but
i
am
ashamed
there
was
a
pause
it
took
time
for
the
pretender
voice
to
reach
the
enemy
and
as
long
for
the
reply
to
come
back
the
reply
was
ironic
and
arrogant
and
amused
terms
can
you
hope
for
it
demanded
attacked
our
ships
you
indulged
in
destruction
how
can
you
hope
for
terms
the
pretender
scratched
his
ear
thoughtfully
he
regarded
the
radar
screen
with
regret
we
ask
life
for
the
people
of
our
planet
he
said
steadily
he
was
annoyed
that
he
had
to
speak
for
the
tardy
king
of
kandar
we
ask
that
they
not
be
punished
for
our
resistance
the
young
men
in
the
control
room
looked
astonished
then
they
saw
bors
expression
and
grinned
a
long
pause
the
boiling
shifting
specks
on
the
began
to
have
a
definite
order
the
mekinese
voice
when
it
came
was
triumphant
and
overbearing
will
spare
your
it
said
contemptuously
not
you
you
have
dared
to
fight
us
stand
and
be
destroyed
and
there
will
be
no
punishment
for
your
world
there
are
no
other
the
pretender
looked
at
bors
he
shrugged
what
would
the
king
do
he
looked
puzzled
what
can
our
dummy
fleet
do
asked
bors
the
pretender
nodded
we
will
offer
no
resistance
he
said
into
the
transmitter
there
was
a
long
silence
bors
looked
at
the
the
mass
of
bright
specks
at
the
edge
of
the
screen
seemed
to
have
sent
a
shining
wave
before
it
it
was
actually
a
swarm
of
missiles
they
were
so
far
away
that
they
could
not
be
picked
up
as
individuals
on
the
screen
they
were
a
glow
a
shine
a
wave
of
pale
luminosity
we
shift
to
overdrive
readiness
said
bors
that
is
an
order
a
murmured
overdrive
in
circuit
he
watched
the
screen
the
mekinese
missiles
accelerated
at
a
terrific
rate
they
left
their
parent
ships
far
behind
they
were
a
third
of
the
way
to
the
and
the
before
bors
spoke
again
launch
and
inflate
another
he
ordered
drily
we
could
speak
for
the
king
since
he
was
late
but
we
wo
stay
here
to
be
killed
as
his
proxy
not
without
fighting
first
a
voice
crisp
globe
launched
overdrive
toward
the
planet
second
five
four
three
two
one
there
was
the
unbearable
double
sensation
of
going
into
and
breakout
from
overdrive
simultaneously
the
vanished
from
its
place
in
the
formation
of
the
dummy
fleet
but
left
a
dummy
where
it
had
been
it
reappeared
a
full
five
thousand
miles
away
the
rushing
missiles
now
were
brighter
they
were
individual
microscopic
specks
like
stars
they
began
visibly
to
converge
upon
the
space
occupied
by
the
dummy
fleet
they
be
counting
the
ships
said
the
pretender
mildly
to
make
sure
that
all
stay
for
their
execution
this
would
be
a
tragic
sight
if
it
were
humphrey
real
fleet
he
is
just
obstinate
enough
to
let
himself
be
killed
on
the
word
of
a
treacherous
mekinese
the
cloud
of
grew
bright
and
came
near
the
dummy
fleet
also
appeared
on
the
screens
in
the
control
room
bors
and
the
others
could
see
the
rushing
shining
flood
of
missiles
as
it
poured
through
space
upon
the
motionless
targets
there
bors
pointed
the
king
ship
breaking
out
away
over
at
the
edge
i
wonder
if
the
mekinese
will
notice
there
were
very
tiny
sparkles
off
at
the
side
of
the
they
increased
in
number
there
was
a
flash
like
the
sun
brought
near
for
the
tenth
of
a
second
another
yet
another
then
an
overwhelming
spout
of
brilliance
as
tens
and
twenties
and
fifties
of
the
trajectiles
went
off
together
it
was
an
unbelievable
sight
against
the
stars
missiles
flamed
and
flashed
and
there
seemed
to
be
an
actual
sun
there
now
flashing
brighter
and
now
fainter
but
intolerably
hot
and
shining
it
went
out
and
left
a
vague
and
shining
vapor
behind
then
belated
missiles
entered
it
and
detonated
their
flares
ceased
then
there
was
nothing
where
there
had
seemed
to
be
a
fleet
which
said
bors
is
that
then
a
voice
spoke
coldly
from
space
all
speakers
for
a
message
in
it
commanded
all
personnel
for
a
general
there
was
a
pause
the
voice
spoke
again
of
it
said
icily
fleet
of
kandar
is
now
destroyed
kandar
itself
will
be
destroyed
also
as
an
example
of
the
consequences
of
perfidy
toward
mekin
but
it
should
be
a
warning
to
others
who
would
conspire
against
our
world
therefore
in
part
as
penalty
and
in
part
as
a
reward
to
the
men
of
the
grand
fleet
you
will
be
allowed
to
land
during
a
period
of
two
weeks
you
will
be
armed
you
may
confiscate
for
yourself
anything
of
value
you
find
you
are
not
required
to
exercise
restraint
in
your
actions
toward
the
people
of
kandar
they
will
be
destroyed
with
their
planet
and
no
protests
from
such
criminals
will
be
listened
to
you
will
be
landed
in
groups
each
on
a
fresh
area
of
the
planet
that
is
there
was
silence
in
the
control
room
of
the
after
a
long
time
the
pretender
said
very
quietly
i
will
not
live
while
such
beasts
live
from
this
moment
i
will
kill
them
until
i
am
killed
i
suspect
king
humphrey
heard
that
bors
said
and
drew
a
deep
breath
combat
alert
he
ordered
crisply
we
attacking
the
mekinese
fleet
handle
your
missiles
smoothly
and
do
try
to
fire
while
we
in
overdrive
we
be
going
in
and
out
choose
your
targets
and
fire
as
we
come
out
and
while
i
count
down
overdrive
point
nine
seconds
five
four
three
two
one
the
cosmos
reeled
and
stomachs
retched
when
the
came
out
in
of
a
second
she
was
in
the
very
midst
of
a
concentration
of
the
mekinese
fleet
missiles
streaked
away
furiously
as
bors
counted
down
second
five
four
three
two
one
more
missiles
shot
away
bors
almost
chanted
while
with
gestures
toward
the
he
picked
out
the
objects
near
which
breakout
should
fall
point
oh
five
seconds
the
ship
went
into
overdrive
and
out
it
seemed
as
if
the
universe
dissolved
from
one
appearance
to
another
outside
the
viewports
five
four
three
two
one
hold
fire
the
came
out
a
good
ten
thousand
miles
from
its
and
beyond
the
area
occupied
by
the
enemy
fleet
three
thousand
miles
away
a
flare
burst
among
the
distant
stars
a
second
a
third
six
thousand
miles
away
there
were
flashings
in
emptiness
we
doing
very
well
said
bors
calmly
into
the
microphone
a
little
more
care
with
the
aiming
though
and
read
your
ranges
closer
they
not
intercepting
our
missiles
we
not
aiming
them
right
we
try
it
again
now
the
universe
seemed
to
reel
and
one
felt
queasy
but
there
was
work
to
be
done
while
a
voice
chanted
five
four
three
two
one
then
it
reeled
again
and
the
same
voice
continued
to
chant
sometimes
the
crews
saw
where
missiles
hit
but
they
could
never
be
sure
they
were
their
own
then
suddenly
the
number
of
hits
increased
they
doubled
and
tripled
and
quadrupled
all
hands
barked
bors
the
fleet
of
kandar
is
wading
into
this
fight
be
careful
to
pick
your
targets
no
kandar
ships
save
your
missiles
for
the
enemy
someone
missiles
for
faster
and
more
firing
than
any
ever
expected
gasped
come
on
boys
missiles
for
mekin
it
became
a
joke
which
seemed
excruciatingly
funny
at
the
time
nobody
saw
all
the
battle
or
even
a
considerable
part
there
was
a
period
when
the
alone
fought
like
the
deadliest
of
gadflies
it
appeared
in
the
middle
of
a
mekinese
loosed
missiles
and
vanished
before
anything
could
be
intercepted
there
was
no
target
for
mekinese
bombs
to
home
on
when
they
got
to
where
the
had
been
then
the
fleet
of
kandar
appeared
it
broke
out
in
single
ships
and
in
pairs
and
then
in
groups
of
fives
and
tens
the
general
order
for
the
mekinese
fleet
had
been
picked
up
and
the
fleet
of
kandar
seemed
to
have
gone
mad
the
flagship
tried
to
fight
in
orthodox
fashion
for
a
time
it
depended
on
the
attraction
its
missiles
had
for
mekinese
to
keep
it
in
space
but
presently
it
was
alone
and
the
battle
was
raging
confusion
scattered
over
and
somebody
went
down
in
to
the
engine
room
and
brazed
in
a
overdrive
unit
providentially
made
by
a
junior
officer
and
the
flagship
of
the
kandarian
fleet
waded
in
erratically
never
knowing
where
it
would
come
out
but
rarely
failing
to
find
a
mekinese
ship
to
launch
at
the
third
phase
of
the
battle
was
much
more
of
an
open
fight
ship
against
ship
except
that
more
and
more
kandarian
ships
were
using
overdrive
clumsily
and
inefficiently
but
to
the
very
great
detriment
of
mekin
grand
fleet
the
mekinese
officers
could
not
quite
grasp
that
their
antagonists
were
doing
the
impossible
they
became
confused
the
fourth
phase
of
the
battle
consisted
of
operations
in
which
individual
ships
were
hunted
down
and
destroyed
by
the
simple
process
of
a
kandarian
ship
seeming
to
materialize
from
nowhere
a
mile
or
half
a
mile
from
an
enemy
launching
one
missile
and
seeming
to
dematerialize
again
and
vanish
very
few
mekinese
ships
went
into
overdrive
probably
most
of
them
did
believe
what
was
happening
perhaps
four
ships
out
of
the
entire
grand
fleet
escaped
later
of
course
there
was
embarrassment
all
around
king
humphrey
the
eighth
landed
on
kandar
to
assure
his
people
that
they
were
no
longer
in
danger
he
was
embarrassed
because
he
was
a
victor
in
spite
of
himself
the
fleet
officers
were
embarrassed
because
bors
had
been
forced
out
of
the
fleet
and
had
literally
tricked
them
into
battle
bors
too
was
embarrassed
there
was
the
admiration
displayed
by
junior
officers
of
the
fleet
he
had
become
very
unwillingly
a
model
for
young
officers
they
tried
to
pattern
themselves
after
him
in
all
ways
even
to
the
angle
at
which
they
wore
their
hats
he
squirmed
when
they
looked
at
him
with
respect
he
was
embarrassed
also
by
the
necessary
revelation
to
the
crew
that
he
was
neither
the
leader
of
a
rebellion
nor
in
command
of
a
fleet
nor
that
he
had
performed
quite
all
the
fabulous
feats
credited
to
him
he
had
to
explain
that
he
only
commanded
two
ships
the
and
the
one
of
which
had
to
be
destroyed
and
that
when
the
placed
itself
under
his
command
he
just
been
forced
to
resign
his
commission
from
king
humphrey
the
young
men
who
fought
under
him
were
unimpressed
the
fleet
was
with
food
and
missiles
and
in
one
day
more
the
major
part
of
it
would
take
off
for
mekin
other
ships
would
journey
of
course
to
the
worlds
there
they
would
they
were
calmly
confident
about
it
mop
up
any
surviving
mekinese
ships
and
enforce
the
surrender
of
mekinese
garrisons
and
they
would
gather
emissaries
to
be
carried
to
the
fleet
as
it
rode
in
orbit
about
mekin
the
fleet
and
the
representatives
of
the
worlds
together
would
firmly
rearrange
the
government
and
the
policies
and
the
ambitions
of
mekin
there
was
still
the
matter
of
gwenlyn
the
came
down
on
kandar
of
course
where
morgan
swaggered
happily
pointing
out
the
indispensable
help
given
to
kandar
by
talents
incorporated
bors
reminded
king
humphrey
that
morgan
collected
medals
and
he
was
duly
invested
with
sundry
glittering
decorations
which
would
have
staggered
a
lesser
man
gwenlyn
found
bors
secluded
in
the
palace
waiting
until
it
was
time
to
board
ship
and
head
for
mekin
her
father
accompanied
her
i
come
to
say
goodbye
she
said
gently
we
done
what
we
came
for
i
still
do
understand
why
you
came
said
bors
who
would
much
rather
have
said
something
else
we
ca
possibly
do
anything
adequate
in
return
why
you
come
he
turned
to
morgan
who
answered
blandly
one
of
our
talents
precognized
an
event
we
had
to
come
here
and
help
it
to
happen
gwenlyn
was
doubtful
but
she
come
around
what
was
it
it
has
happened
yet
said
morgan
he
produced
a
cigar
and
lighted
it
gwenlyn
shall
i
tell
him
do
you
dare
said
gwenlyn
hotly
bors
said
unhappily
i
sorry
you
going
away
gwenlyn
if
things
were
different
i
i
you
what
asked
morgan
by
the
way
one
of
our
talents
has
precognized
that
your
uncle
going
back
to
tralee
as
its
king
again
largely
on
your
account
you
his
heir
are
you
bors
blinked
hero
said
morgan
waving
his
hand
planets
adoring
you
believing
you
brought
mekin
down
aching
to
work
with
you
follow
you
admire
you
naturally
tralee
wants
your
uncle
back
then
they
have
you
of
course
he
added
complacently
our
department
for
disseminating
truthful
seditious
rumors
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
that
was
necessary
wartime
propaganda
and
you
did
let
anybody
down
then
he
said
peevishly
not
until
now
bors
gaped
he
looked
at
gwenlyn
her
cheeks
were
crimson
revelation
struck
bors
like
a
blow
i
do
believe
it
he
said
staring
at
her
he
said
more
loudly
i
do
believe
it
damnit
said
morgan
indignantly
she
did
believe
it
either
she
said
she
come
here
because
she
was
curious
nothing
more
but
that
particular
talent
never
missed
yet
she
just
plain
every
time
who
hush
said
gwenlyn
fiercely
goodbye
bors
moved
toward
her
not
to
shake
hands
she
ran
out
of
the
door
she
ran
fast
for
a
girl
he
ran
faster
morgan
puffed
contentedly
presently
the
completely
unreal
figure
of
king
humphrey
the
eighth
came
to
where
morgan
had
surrounded
himself
with
aromatic
smoke
where
bors
asked
the
king
yonder
said
morgan
he
waved
his
hand
kissing
my
daughter
i
think
know
majesty
i
known
this
would
happen
all
along
one
of
our
talents
precognized
you
opening
parliament
next
year
so
i
knew
things
had
to
come
out
right
said
the
king
dubiously
i
suppose
so
but
there
had
to
be
efforts
too
to
bring
it
about
otherwise
it
would
seem
right
naturally
said
morgan
when
one
of
my
talents
precognized
that
gwenlyn
was
going
to
marry
the
heir
of
the
pretender
of
tralee
and
be
queen
of
tralee
some
day
why
it
did
seem
a
bit
likely
but
once
i
knew
about
that
precognition
i
put
in
a
little
effort
king
humphrey
was
thoughtful
things
look
good
said
morgan
expansively
my
talents
are
precognizing
all
over
the
place
they
tell
me
that
this
planet
going
to
be
a
fine
place
to
live
quiet
and
peaceful
and
serene
gwenlyn
will
be
living
on
tralee
most
likely
and
i
do
want
to
be
underfoot
i
probably
settle
down
here
retire
you
know
splendid
said
the
king
politely
his
mind
occupied
with
the
prospect
of
a
warless
future
and
as
for
gwenlyn
and
bors
morgan
added
confidentially
i
tell
you
something
my
talents
been
working
on
her
future
i
would
tell
her
all
of
it
some
of
it
should
be
a
surprise
but
she
and
bors
are
going
to
be
what
you
call
happy
ever
after
