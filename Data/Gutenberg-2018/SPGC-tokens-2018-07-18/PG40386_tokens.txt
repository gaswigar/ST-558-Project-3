chapter
i
sir
hugh
ockram
smiled
as
he
sat
by
the
open
window
of
his
study
in
the
late
august
afternoon
and
just
then
a
curiously
yellow
cloud
obscured
the
low
sun
and
the
clear
summer
light
turned
lurid
as
if
it
had
been
suddenly
poisoned
and
polluted
by
the
foul
vapours
of
a
plague
sir
hugh
face
seemed
at
best
to
be
made
of
fine
parchment
drawn
over
a
wooden
mask
in
which
two
eyes
were
sunk
out
of
sight
and
peered
from
far
within
through
crevices
under
the
slanting
wrinkled
lids
alive
and
watchful
like
two
toads
in
their
holes
side
by
side
and
exactly
alike
but
as
the
light
changed
then
a
little
yellow
glare
flashed
in
each
nurse
macdonald
said
once
that
when
sir
hugh
smiled
he
saw
the
faces
of
two
women
in
hell
two
dead
women
he
had
betrayed
nurse
macdonald
was
a
hundred
years
old
and
the
smile
widened
stretching
the
pale
lips
across
the
discoloured
teeth
in
an
expression
of
profound
blended
with
the
most
unforgiving
hatred
and
contempt
for
the
human
doll
the
hideous
disease
of
which
he
was
dying
had
touched
his
brain
his
son
stood
beside
him
tall
white
and
delicate
as
an
angel
in
a
primitive
picture
and
though
there
was
deep
distress
in
his
violet
eyes
as
he
looked
at
his
father
face
he
felt
the
shadow
of
that
sickening
smile
stealing
across
his
own
lips
and
parting
them
and
drawing
them
against
his
will
and
it
was
like
a
bad
dream
for
he
tried
not
to
smile
and
smiled
the
more
beside
him
strangely
like
him
in
her
wan
angelic
beauty
with
the
same
shadowy
golden
hair
the
same
sad
violet
eyes
the
same
luminously
pale
face
evelyn
warburton
rested
one
hand
upon
his
arm
and
as
she
looked
into
her
uncle
eyes
and
could
not
turn
her
own
away
she
knew
that
the
deathly
smile
was
hovering
on
her
own
red
lips
drawing
them
tightly
across
her
little
teeth
while
two
bright
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
to
her
mouth
and
dropped
from
the
upper
to
the
lower
lip
while
she
smiled
and
the
smile
was
like
the
shadow
of
death
and
the
seal
of
damnation
upon
her
pure
young
face
of
course
said
sir
hugh
very
slowly
and
still
looking
out
at
the
trees
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
be
married
i
can
not
hinder
you
and
i
do
suppose
you
attach
the
smallest
importance
to
my
consent
father
exclaimed
gabriel
reproachfully
no
i
do
not
deceive
myself
continued
the
old
man
smiling
terribly
you
will
marry
when
i
am
dead
though
there
is
a
very
good
reason
why
you
had
better
not
why
you
had
better
not
he
repeated
very
emphatically
and
he
slowly
turned
his
toad
eyes
upon
the
lovers
what
reason
asked
evelyn
in
a
frightened
voice
never
mind
the
reason
my
dear
you
will
marry
just
as
if
it
did
not
exist
there
was
a
long
pause
two
gone
he
said
his
voice
lowering
strangely
and
two
more
will
be
four
all
together
for
ever
and
ever
burning
burning
burning
bright
at
the
last
words
his
head
sank
slowly
back
and
the
little
glare
of
the
toad
eyes
disappeared
under
the
swollen
lids
and
the
lurid
cloud
passed
from
the
westering
sun
so
that
the
earth
was
green
again
and
the
light
pure
sir
hugh
had
fallen
asleep
as
he
often
did
in
his
last
illness
even
while
speaking
gabriel
ockram
drew
evelyn
away
and
from
the
study
they
went
out
into
the
dim
hall
softly
closing
the
door
behind
them
and
each
audibly
drew
breath
as
though
some
sudden
danger
had
been
passed
they
laid
their
hands
each
in
the
other
and
their
eyes
met
in
a
long
look
in
which
love
and
perfect
understanding
were
darkened
by
the
secret
terror
of
an
unknown
thing
their
pale
faces
reflected
each
other
fear
it
is
his
secret
said
evelyn
at
last
he
will
never
tell
us
what
it
is
if
he
dies
with
it
answered
gabriel
let
it
be
on
his
own
head
on
his
head
echoed
the
dim
hall
it
was
a
strange
echo
and
some
were
frightened
by
it
for
they
said
that
if
it
were
a
real
echo
it
should
repeat
everything
and
not
give
back
a
phrase
here
and
there
now
speaking
now
silent
but
nurse
macdonald
said
that
the
great
hall
would
never
echo
a
prayer
when
an
ockram
was
to
die
though
it
would
give
back
curses
ten
for
one
on
his
head
it
repeated
quite
softly
and
evelyn
started
and
looked
round
it
is
only
the
echo
said
gabriel
leading
her
away
they
went
out
into
the
late
afternoon
light
and
sat
upon
a
stone
seat
behind
the
chapel
which
was
built
across
the
end
of
the
east
wing
it
was
very
still
not
a
breath
stirred
and
there
was
no
sound
near
them
only
far
off
in
the
park
a
was
whistling
the
high
prelude
to
the
evening
chorus
it
is
very
lonely
here
said
evelyn
taking
gabriel
hand
nervously
and
speaking
as
if
she
dreaded
to
disturb
the
silence
if
it
were
dark
i
should
be
afraid
of
what
of
me
gabriel
sad
eyes
turned
to
her
oh
no
how
could
i
be
afraid
of
you
but
of
the
old
ockrams
they
say
they
are
just
under
our
feet
here
in
the
north
vault
outside
the
chapel
all
in
their
shrouds
with
no
coffins
as
they
used
to
bury
them
as
they
always
will
as
they
will
bury
my
father
and
me
they
say
an
ockram
will
not
lie
in
a
coffin
but
it
can
not
be
true
these
are
fairy
tales
ghost
stories
evelyn
nestled
nearer
to
her
companion
grasping
his
hand
more
tightly
and
the
sun
began
to
go
down
of
course
but
there
is
the
story
of
old
sir
vernon
who
was
beheaded
for
treason
under
james
ii
the
family
brought
his
body
back
from
the
scaffold
in
an
iron
coffin
with
heavy
locks
and
they
put
it
in
the
north
vault
but
ever
afterwards
whenever
the
vault
was
opened
to
bury
another
of
the
family
they
found
the
coffin
wide
open
and
the
body
standing
upright
against
the
wall
and
the
head
rolled
away
in
a
corner
smiling
at
it
as
uncle
hugh
smiles
evelyn
shivered
yes
i
suppose
so
answered
gabriel
thoughtfully
of
course
i
never
saw
it
and
the
vault
has
not
been
opened
for
thirty
years
none
of
us
have
died
since
then
and
if
if
uncle
hugh
dies
shall
you
evelyn
stopped
and
her
beautiful
thin
face
was
quite
white
yes
i
shall
see
him
laid
there
too
with
his
secret
whatever
it
is
gabriel
sighed
and
pressed
the
girl
little
hand
i
do
not
like
to
think
of
it
she
said
unsteadily
o
gabriel
what
can
the
secret
be
he
said
we
had
better
not
marry
not
that
he
forbade
it
but
he
said
it
so
strangely
and
he
smiled
ugh
her
small
white
teeth
chattered
with
fear
and
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
while
drawing
still
closer
to
gabriel
and
somehow
i
felt
it
in
my
own
face
so
did
i
answered
gabriel
in
a
low
nervous
voice
nurse
macdonald
he
stopped
abruptly
what
what
did
she
say
oh
nothing
she
has
told
me
things
they
would
frighten
you
dear
come
it
is
growing
chilly
he
rose
but
evelyn
held
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
still
sitting
and
looking
up
into
his
face
but
we
shall
be
married
just
the
same
gabriel
say
that
we
shall
of
course
darling
of
course
but
while
my
father
is
so
very
ill
it
is
impossible
o
gabriel
gabriel
dear
i
wish
we
were
married
now
cried
evelyn
in
sudden
distress
i
know
that
something
will
prevent
it
and
keep
us
apart
nothing
shall
nothing
nothing
human
said
gabriel
ockram
as
she
drew
him
down
to
her
and
their
faces
that
were
so
strangely
alike
met
and
touched
and
gabriel
knew
that
the
kiss
had
a
marvellous
savour
of
evil
but
on
evelyn
lips
it
was
like
the
cool
breath
of
a
sweet
and
mortal
fear
and
neither
of
them
understood
for
they
were
innocent
and
young
yet
she
drew
him
to
her
by
her
lightest
touch
as
a
sensitive
plant
shivers
and
waves
its
thin
leaves
and
bends
and
closes
softly
upon
what
it
wants
and
he
let
himself
be
drawn
to
her
willingly
as
he
would
if
her
touch
had
been
deadly
and
poisonous
for
she
strangely
loved
that
half
voluptuous
breath
of
fear
and
he
passionately
desired
the
nameless
evil
something
that
lurked
in
her
maiden
lips
it
is
as
if
we
loved
in
a
strange
dream
she
said
i
fear
the
waking
he
murmured
we
shall
not
wake
dear
when
the
dream
is
over
it
will
have
already
turned
into
death
so
softly
that
we
shall
not
know
it
but
until
then
she
paused
and
her
eyes
sought
his
and
their
faces
slowly
came
nearer
it
was
as
if
they
had
thoughts
in
their
red
lips
that
foresaw
and
foreknew
the
deep
kiss
of
each
other
until
then
she
said
again
very
low
and
her
mouth
was
nearer
to
his
dream
till
then
murmured
his
breath
chapter
ii
nurse
macdonald
was
a
hundred
years
old
she
used
to
sleep
sitting
all
bent
together
in
a
great
old
leathern
with
wings
her
feet
in
a
bag
footstool
lined
with
sheepskin
and
many
warm
blankets
wrapped
about
her
even
in
summer
beside
her
a
little
lamp
always
burned
at
night
by
an
old
silver
cup
in
which
there
was
something
to
drink
her
face
was
very
wrinkled
but
the
wrinkles
were
so
small
and
fine
and
near
together
that
they
made
shadows
instead
of
lines
two
thin
locks
of
hair
that
was
turning
from
white
to
a
smoky
yellow
again
were
drawn
over
her
temples
from
under
her
starched
white
cap
every
now
and
then
she
woke
and
her
eyelids
were
drawn
up
in
tiny
folds
like
little
pink
silk
curtains
and
her
queer
blue
eyes
looked
straight
before
her
through
doors
and
walls
and
worlds
to
a
far
place
beyond
then
she
slept
again
and
her
hands
lay
one
upon
the
other
on
the
edge
of
the
blanket
the
thumbs
had
grown
longer
than
the
fingers
with
age
and
the
joints
shone
in
the
low
lamplight
like
polished
it
was
nearly
one
in
the
night
and
the
summer
breeze
was
blowing
the
ivy
branch
against
the
panes
of
the
window
with
a
hushing
caress
in
the
small
room
beyond
with
the
door
ajar
the
who
took
care
of
nurse
macdonald
was
fast
asleep
all
was
very
quiet
the
old
woman
breathed
regularly
and
her
indrawn
lips
trembled
each
time
as
the
breath
went
out
and
her
eyes
were
shut
but
outside
the
closed
window
there
was
a
face
and
violet
eyes
were
looking
steadily
at
the
ancient
sleeper
for
it
was
like
the
face
of
evelyn
warburton
though
there
were
eighty
feet
from
the
sill
of
the
window
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
yet
the
cheeks
were
thinner
than
evelyn
and
as
white
as
a
gleam
and
the
eyes
stared
and
the
lips
were
not
red
with
life
they
were
dead
and
painted
with
new
blood
slowly
nurse
macdonald
wrinkled
eyelids
folded
themselves
back
and
she
looked
straight
at
the
face
at
the
window
while
one
might
count
ten
is
it
time
she
asked
in
her
little
old
faraway
voice
while
she
looked
the
face
at
the
window
changed
for
the
eyes
opened
wider
and
wider
till
the
white
glared
all
round
the
bright
violet
and
the
bloody
lips
opened
over
gleaming
teeth
and
stretched
and
widened
and
stretched
again
and
the
shadowy
golden
hair
rose
and
streamed
against
the
window
in
the
night
breeze
and
in
answer
to
nurse
macdonald
question
came
the
sound
that
freezes
the
living
flesh
that
voice
that
rises
suddenly
like
the
scream
of
storm
from
a
moan
to
a
wail
from
a
wail
to
a
howl
from
a
howl
to
the
of
the
tortured
dead
he
who
has
heard
knows
and
he
can
bear
witness
that
the
cry
of
the
banshee
is
an
evil
cry
to
hear
alone
in
the
deep
night
when
it
was
over
and
the
face
was
gone
nurse
macdonald
shook
a
little
in
her
great
chair
and
still
she
looked
at
the
black
square
of
the
window
but
there
was
nothing
more
there
nothing
but
the
night
and
the
whispering
ivy
branch
she
turned
her
head
to
the
door
that
was
ajar
and
there
stood
the
girl
in
her
white
gown
her
teeth
chattering
with
fright
it
is
time
child
said
nurse
macdonald
i
must
go
to
him
for
it
is
the
end
she
rose
slowly
leaning
her
withered
hands
upon
the
arms
of
the
chair
and
the
girl
brought
her
a
woollen
gown
and
a
great
mantle
and
her
and
made
her
ready
but
very
often
the
girl
looked
at
the
window
and
was
unjointed
with
fear
and
often
nurse
macdonald
shook
her
head
and
said
words
which
the
maid
could
not
understand
it
was
like
the
face
of
miss
evelyn
said
the
girl
at
last
trembling
but
the
ancient
woman
looked
up
sharply
and
angrily
and
her
queer
blue
eyes
glared
she
held
herself
by
the
arm
of
the
great
chair
with
her
left
hand
and
lifted
up
her
to
strike
the
maid
with
all
her
might
but
she
did
not
you
are
a
good
girl
she
said
but
you
are
a
fool
pray
for
wit
child
pray
for
wit
or
else
find
service
in
another
house
than
ockram
hall
bring
the
lamp
and
help
me
under
my
left
arm
the
clacked
on
the
wooden
floor
and
the
low
heels
of
the
woman
slippers
clappered
after
her
in
slow
triplets
as
nurse
macdonald
got
toward
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
each
step
she
took
was
a
labour
in
itself
and
by
the
clacking
noise
the
waking
servants
knew
that
she
was
coming
very
long
before
they
saw
her
no
one
was
sleeping
now
and
there
were
lights
and
whisperings
and
pale
faces
in
the
corridors
near
sir
hugh
bedroom
and
now
some
one
went
in
and
now
some
one
came
out
but
every
one
made
way
for
nurse
macdonald
who
had
nursed
sir
hugh
father
more
than
eighty
years
ago
the
light
was
soft
and
clear
in
the
room
there
stood
gabriel
ockram
by
his
father
bedside
and
there
knelt
evelyn
warburton
her
hair
lying
like
a
golden
shadow
down
her
shoulders
and
her
hands
clasped
nervously
together
and
opposite
gabriel
a
nurse
was
trying
to
make
sir
hugh
drink
but
he
would
not
and
though
his
lips
were
parted
his
teeth
were
set
he
was
very
very
thin
and
yellow
now
and
his
eyes
caught
the
light
sideways
and
were
as
yellow
coals
do
not
torment
him
said
nurse
macdonald
to
the
woman
who
held
the
cup
let
me
speak
to
him
for
his
hour
is
come
let
her
speak
to
him
said
gabriel
in
a
dull
voice
so
the
ancient
woman
leaned
to
the
pillow
and
laid
the
of
her
withered
hand
that
was
like
a
brown
moth
upon
sir
hugh
yellow
fingers
and
she
spoke
to
him
earnestly
while
only
gabriel
and
evelyn
were
left
in
the
room
to
hear
hugh
ockram
she
said
this
is
the
end
of
your
life
and
as
i
saw
you
born
and
saw
your
father
born
before
you
i
am
come
to
see
you
die
hugh
ockram
will
you
tell
me
the
truth
the
dying
man
recognised
the
little
faraway
voice
he
had
known
all
his
life
and
he
very
slowly
turned
his
yellow
face
to
nurse
macdonald
but
he
said
nothing
then
she
spoke
again
hugh
ockram
you
will
never
see
the
daylight
again
will
you
tell
the
truth
his
eyes
were
not
yet
dull
they
fastened
themselves
on
her
face
what
do
you
want
of
me
he
asked
and
each
word
struck
hollow
upon
the
last
i
have
no
secrets
i
have
lived
a
good
life
nurse
macdonald
laughed
a
tiny
cracked
laugh
that
made
her
old
head
bob
and
tremble
a
little
as
if
her
neck
were
on
a
steel
spring
but
sir
hugh
eyes
grew
red
and
his
pale
lips
began
to
twist
let
me
die
in
peace
he
said
slowly
but
nurse
macdonald
shook
her
head
and
her
brown
hand
left
his
and
fluttered
to
his
forehead
by
the
mother
that
bore
you
and
died
of
grief
for
the
sins
you
did
tell
me
the
truth
sir
hugh
lips
tightened
on
his
discoloured
teeth
not
on
earth
he
answered
slowly
by
the
wife
who
bore
your
son
and
died
heartbroken
tell
me
the
truth
neither
to
you
in
life
nor
to
her
in
eternal
death
his
lips
writhed
as
if
the
words
were
coals
between
them
and
a
great
drop
of
sweat
rolled
across
the
parchment
of
his
forehead
gabriel
ockram
bit
his
hand
as
he
watched
his
father
die
but
nurse
macdonald
spoke
a
third
time
by
the
woman
whom
you
betrayed
and
who
waits
for
you
this
night
hugh
ockram
tell
me
the
truth
it
is
too
late
let
me
die
in
peace
the
writhing
lips
began
to
smile
across
the
set
yellow
teeth
and
the
toad
eyes
glowed
like
evil
jewels
in
his
head
there
is
time
said
the
ancient
woman
tell
me
the
name
of
evelyn
warburton
father
then
i
will
let
you
die
in
peace
evelyn
started
back
kneeling
as
she
was
and
stared
at
nurse
macdonald
and
then
at
her
uncle
the
name
of
evelyn
father
he
repeated
slowly
while
the
awful
smile
spread
upon
his
dying
face
the
light
was
growing
strangely
dim
in
the
great
room
as
evelyn
looked
nurse
macdonald
crooked
shadow
on
the
wall
grew
gigantic
sir
breath
came
thick
rattling
in
his
throat
as
death
crept
in
like
a
snake
and
choked
it
back
evelyn
prayed
aloud
high
and
clear
then
something
rapped
at
the
window
and
she
felt
her
hair
rise
upon
her
head
in
a
cool
breeze
as
she
looked
around
in
spite
of
herself
and
when
she
saw
her
own
white
face
looking
in
at
the
window
and
her
own
eyes
staring
at
her
through
the
glass
wide
and
fearful
and
her
own
hair
streaming
against
the
pane
and
her
own
lips
dashed
with
blood
she
rose
slowly
from
the
floor
and
stood
rigid
for
one
moment
till
she
screamed
once
and
fell
straight
back
into
gabriel
arms
but
the
shriek
that
answered
hers
was
the
of
the
tormented
corpse
out
of
which
the
soul
can
not
pass
for
shame
of
deadly
sins
though
the
devils
fight
in
it
with
corruption
each
for
their
due
share
sir
hugh
ockram
sat
upright
in
his
deathbed
and
saw
and
cried
aloud
evelyn
his
harsh
voice
broke
and
rattled
in
his
chest
as
he
sank
down
but
still
nurse
macdonald
tortured
him
for
there
was
a
little
life
left
in
him
still
you
have
seen
the
mother
as
she
waits
for
you
hugh
ockram
who
was
this
girl
evelyn
father
what
was
his
name
for
the
last
time
the
dreadful
smile
came
upon
the
twisted
lips
very
slowly
very
surely
now
and
the
toad
eyes
glared
red
and
the
parchment
face
glowed
a
little
in
the
flickering
light
for
the
last
time
words
came
they
know
it
in
hell
then
the
glowing
eyes
went
out
quickly
the
yellow
face
turned
waxen
pale
and
a
great
shiver
ran
through
the
thin
body
as
hugh
ockram
died
but
in
death
he
still
smiled
for
he
knew
his
secret
and
kept
it
still
on
the
other
side
and
he
would
take
it
with
him
to
lie
with
him
for
ever
in
the
north
vault
of
the
chapel
where
the
ockrams
lie
uncoffined
in
their
shrouds
all
but
one
though
he
was
dead
he
smiled
for
he
had
kept
his
treasure
of
evil
truth
to
the
end
and
there
was
none
left
to
tell
the
name
he
had
spoken
but
there
was
all
the
evil
he
had
not
undone
left
to
bear
fruit
as
they
watched
nurse
macdonald
and
gabriel
who
held
evelyn
still
unconscious
in
his
arms
while
he
looked
at
the
father
they
felt
the
dead
smile
crawling
along
their
own
lips
the
ancient
crone
and
the
youth
with
the
angel
face
then
they
shivered
a
little
and
both
looked
at
evelyn
as
she
lay
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
though
she
was
very
beautiful
the
same
sickening
smile
was
twisting
her
young
mouth
too
and
it
was
like
the
foreshadowing
of
a
great
evil
which
they
could
not
understand
but
by
and
by
they
carried
evelyn
out
and
she
opened
her
eyes
and
the
smile
was
gone
from
far
away
in
the
great
house
the
sound
of
weeping
and
crooning
came
up
the
stairs
and
echoed
along
the
dismal
corridors
for
the
women
had
begun
to
mourn
the
dead
master
after
the
irish
fashion
and
the
hall
had
echoes
of
its
own
all
that
night
like
the
wail
of
the
banshee
among
forest
trees
when
the
time
was
come
they
took
sir
hugh
in
his
on
a
trestle
bier
and
bore
him
to
the
chapel
and
through
the
iron
door
and
down
the
long
descent
to
the
north
vault
with
tapers
to
lay
him
by
his
father
and
two
men
went
in
first
to
prepare
the
place
and
came
back
staggering
like
drunken
men
and
white
leaving
their
lights
behind
them
but
gabriel
ockram
was
not
afraid
for
he
knew
and
he
went
in
alone
and
saw
that
the
body
of
sir
vernon
ockram
was
leaning
upright
against
the
stone
wall
and
that
its
head
lay
on
the
ground
near
by
with
the
face
turned
up
and
the
dried
leathern
lips
smiled
horribly
at
the
corpse
while
the
iron
coffin
lined
with
black
velvet
stood
open
on
the
floor
then
gabriel
took
the
thing
in
his
hands
for
it
was
very
light
being
quite
dried
by
the
air
of
the
vault
and
those
who
peeped
in
from
the
door
saw
him
lay
it
in
the
coffin
again
and
it
rustled
a
little
like
a
bundle
of
reeds
and
sounded
hollow
as
it
touched
the
sides
and
the
bottom
he
also
placed
the
head
upon
the
shoulders
and
shut
down
the
lid
which
fell
to
with
a
rusty
spring
that
snapped
after
that
they
laid
sir
hugh
beside
his
father
with
the
trestle
bier
on
which
they
had
brought
him
and
they
went
back
to
the
chapel
but
when
they
saw
one
another
faces
master
and
men
they
were
all
smiling
with
the
dead
smile
of
the
corpse
they
had
left
in
the
vault
so
that
they
could
not
bear
to
look
at
one
another
until
it
had
faded
away
chapter
iii
gabriel
ockram
became
sir
gabriel
inheriting
the
baronetcy
with
the
fortune
left
by
his
father
and
still
evelyn
warburton
lived
at
ockram
hall
in
the
south
room
that
had
been
hers
ever
since
she
could
remember
anything
she
could
not
go
away
for
there
were
no
relatives
to
whom
she
could
have
gone
and
besides
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
she
should
not
stay
the
world
would
never
trouble
itself
to
care
what
the
ockrams
did
on
their
irish
estates
and
it
was
long
since
the
ockrams
had
asked
anything
of
the
world
so
sir
gabriel
took
his
father
place
at
the
dark
old
table
in
the
and
evelyn
sat
opposite
to
him
until
such
time
as
their
mourning
should
be
over
and
they
might
be
married
at
last
and
meanwhile
their
lives
went
on
as
before
since
sir
hugh
had
been
a
hopeless
invalid
during
the
last
year
of
his
life
and
they
had
seen
him
but
once
a
day
for
a
little
while
spending
most
of
their
time
together
in
a
strangely
perfect
companionship
but
though
the
late
summer
saddened
into
autumn
and
autumn
darkened
into
winter
and
storm
followed
storm
and
rain
poured
on
rain
through
the
short
days
and
the
long
nights
yet
ockram
hall
seemed
less
gloomy
since
sir
hugh
had
been
laid
in
the
north
vault
beside
his
father
and
at
christmastide
evelyn
decked
the
great
hall
with
holly
and
green
boughs
and
huge
fires
blazed
on
every
hearth
then
the
tenants
were
all
bidden
to
a
new
year
dinner
and
they
ate
and
drank
well
while
sir
gabriel
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
evelyn
came
in
when
the
port
wine
was
brought
and
the
most
respected
of
the
tenants
made
a
speech
to
propose
her
health
it
was
long
he
said
since
there
had
been
a
lady
ockram
sir
gabriel
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
looked
down
at
the
table
but
a
faint
colour
came
into
evelyn
transparent
cheeks
but
said
the
farmer
it
was
longer
still
since
there
had
been
a
lady
ockram
so
fair
as
the
next
was
to
be
and
he
gave
the
health
of
evelyn
warburton
then
the
tenants
all
stood
up
and
shouted
for
her
and
sir
gabriel
stood
up
likewise
beside
evelyn
and
when
the
men
gave
the
last
and
loudest
cheer
of
all
there
was
a
voice
not
theirs
above
them
all
higher
fiercer
louder
a
scream
not
earthly
shrieking
for
the
bride
of
ockram
hall
and
the
holly
and
the
green
boughs
over
the
great
shook
and
slowly
waved
as
if
a
cool
breeze
were
blowing
over
them
but
the
men
turned
very
pale
and
many
of
them
set
down
their
glasses
but
others
let
them
fall
upon
the
floor
for
fear
and
looking
into
one
another
faces
they
were
all
smiling
strangely
a
dead
smile
like
dead
sir
hugh
one
cried
out
words
in
irish
and
the
fear
of
death
was
suddenly
upon
them
all
so
that
they
fled
in
panic
falling
over
one
another
like
wild
beasts
in
the
burning
forest
when
the
thick
smoke
runs
along
before
the
flame
and
the
tables
were
and
drinking
glasses
and
bottles
were
broken
in
heaps
and
the
dark
red
wine
crawled
like
blood
upon
the
polished
floor
sir
gabriel
and
evelyn
stood
alone
at
the
head
of
the
table
before
the
wreck
of
the
feast
not
daring
to
turn
to
see
each
other
for
each
knew
that
the
other
smiled
but
his
right
arm
held
her
and
his
left
hand
clasped
her
right
as
they
stared
before
them
and
but
for
the
shadows
of
her
hair
one
might
not
have
told
their
two
faces
apart
they
listened
long
but
the
cry
came
not
again
and
the
dead
smile
faded
from
their
lips
while
each
remembered
that
sir
hugh
ockram
lay
in
the
north
vault
smiling
in
his
in
the
dark
because
he
had
died
with
his
secret
so
ended
the
tenants
new
year
dinner
but
from
that
time
on
sir
gabriel
grew
more
and
more
silent
and
his
face
grew
even
paler
and
thinner
than
before
often
without
warning
and
without
words
he
would
rise
from
his
seat
as
if
something
moved
him
against
his
will
and
he
would
go
out
into
the
rain
or
the
sunshine
to
the
north
side
of
the
chapel
and
sit
on
the
stone
bench
staring
at
the
ground
as
if
he
could
see
through
it
and
through
the
vault
below
and
through
the
white
in
the
dark
to
the
dead
smile
that
would
not
die
always
when
he
went
out
in
that
way
evelyn
came
out
presently
and
sat
beside
him
once
too
as
in
summer
their
beautiful
faces
came
suddenly
near
and
their
lids
drooped
and
their
red
lips
were
almost
joined
together
but
as
their
eyes
met
they
grew
wide
and
wild
so
that
the
white
showed
in
a
ring
all
round
the
deep
violet
and
their
teeth
chattered
and
their
hands
were
like
hands
of
corpses
each
in
the
other
for
the
terror
of
what
was
under
their
feet
and
of
what
they
knew
but
could
not
see
once
also
evelyn
found
sir
gabriel
in
the
chapel
alone
standing
before
the
iron
door
that
led
down
to
the
place
of
death
and
in
his
hand
there
was
the
key
to
the
door
but
he
had
not
put
it
into
the
lock
evelyn
drew
him
away
shivering
for
she
had
also
been
driven
in
waking
dreams
to
see
that
terrible
thing
again
and
to
find
out
whether
it
had
changed
since
it
had
lain
there
i
going
mad
said
sir
gabriel
covering
his
eyes
with
his
hand
as
he
went
with
her
i
see
it
in
my
sleep
i
see
it
when
i
am
awake
it
draws
me
to
it
day
and
night
and
unless
i
see
it
i
shall
die
i
know
answered
evelyn
i
know
it
is
as
if
threads
were
spun
from
it
like
a
spider
drawing
us
down
to
it
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
she
started
violently
and
grasped
his
arm
with
a
strength
and
almost
screamed
the
words
she
spoke
but
we
must
not
go
there
she
cried
we
must
not
go
sir
gabriel
eyes
were
half
shut
and
he
was
not
moved
by
the
agony
of
her
face
i
shall
die
unless
i
see
it
again
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice
not
like
his
own
and
all
that
day
and
that
evening
he
scarcely
spoke
thinking
of
it
always
thinking
while
evelyn
warburton
quivered
from
head
to
foot
with
a
terror
she
had
never
known
she
went
alone
on
a
grey
winter
morning
to
nurse
macdonald
room
in
the
tower
and
sat
down
beside
the
great
leathern
laying
her
thin
white
hand
upon
the
withered
fingers
nurse
she
said
what
was
it
that
uncle
hugh
should
have
told
you
that
night
before
he
died
it
must
have
been
an
awful
secret
and
yet
though
you
asked
him
i
feel
somehow
that
you
know
it
and
that
you
know
why
he
used
to
smile
so
dreadfully
the
old
woman
head
moved
slowly
from
side
to
side
i
only
guess
i
shall
never
know
she
answered
slowly
in
her
cracked
little
voice
but
what
do
you
guess
who
am
i
why
did
you
ask
who
my
father
was
you
know
i
am
colonel
warburton
daughter
and
my
mother
was
lady
sister
so
that
gabriel
and
i
are
cousins
my
father
was
killed
in
afghanistan
what
secret
can
there
be
i
do
not
know
i
can
only
guess
guess
what
asked
evelyn
imploringly
and
pressing
the
soft
withered
hands
as
she
leaned
forward
but
nurse
macdonald
wrinkled
lids
dropped
suddenly
over
her
queer
blue
eyes
and
her
lips
shook
a
little
with
her
breath
as
if
she
were
asleep
evelyn
waited
by
the
fire
the
irish
maid
was
knitting
fast
and
the
needles
clicked
like
three
or
four
clocks
ticking
against
each
other
and
the
real
clock
on
the
wall
solemnly
ticked
alone
checking
off
the
seconds
of
the
woman
who
was
a
hundred
years
old
and
had
not
many
days
left
outside
the
ivy
branch
beat
the
window
in
the
wintry
blast
as
it
had
beaten
against
the
glass
a
hundred
years
ago
then
as
evelyn
sat
there
she
felt
again
the
waking
of
a
horrible
desire
the
sickening
wish
to
go
down
down
to
the
thing
in
the
north
vault
and
to
open
the
and
see
whether
it
had
changed
and
she
held
nurse
macdonald
hands
as
if
to
keep
herself
in
her
place
and
fight
against
the
appalling
attraction
of
the
evil
dead
but
the
old
cat
that
kept
nurse
macdonald
feet
warm
lying
always
on
the
bag
footstool
got
up
and
stretched
itself
and
looked
up
into
evelyn
eyes
while
its
back
arched
and
its
tail
thickened
and
bristled
and
its
ugly
pink
lips
drew
back
in
a
devilish
grin
showing
its
sharp
teeth
evelyn
stared
at
it
half
fascinated
by
its
ugliness
then
the
creature
suddenly
put
out
one
paw
with
all
its
claws
spread
and
spat
at
the
girl
and
all
at
once
the
grinning
cat
was
like
the
smiling
corpse
far
down
below
so
that
evelyn
shivered
down
to
her
small
feet
and
covered
her
face
with
her
free
hand
lest
nurse
macdonald
should
wake
and
see
the
dead
smile
there
for
she
could
feel
it
the
old
woman
had
already
opened
her
eyes
again
and
she
touched
her
cat
with
the
end
of
her
whereupon
its
back
went
down
and
its
tail
shrunk
and
it
sidled
back
to
its
place
on
the
bag
footstool
but
its
yellow
eyes
looked
up
sideways
at
evelyn
between
the
slits
of
its
lids
what
is
it
that
you
guess
nurse
asked
the
young
girl
again
a
bad
thing
a
wicked
thing
but
i
dare
not
tell
you
lest
it
might
not
be
true
and
the
very
thought
should
blast
your
life
for
if
i
guess
right
he
meant
that
you
should
not
know
and
that
you
two
should
marry
and
pay
for
his
old
sin
with
your
souls
he
used
to
tell
us
that
we
ought
not
to
marry
yes
he
told
you
that
perhaps
but
it
was
as
if
a
man
put
poisoned
meat
before
a
starving
beast
and
said
not
eat
but
never
raised
his
hand
to
take
the
meat
away
and
if
he
told
you
that
you
should
not
marry
it
was
because
he
hoped
you
would
for
of
all
men
living
or
dead
hugh
ockram
was
the
falsest
man
that
ever
told
a
cowardly
lie
and
the
cruelest
that
ever
hurt
a
weak
woman
and
the
worst
that
ever
loved
a
sin
but
gabriel
and
i
love
each
other
said
evelyn
very
sadly
nurse
macdonald
old
eyes
looked
far
away
at
sights
seen
long
ago
and
that
rose
in
the
grey
winter
air
amid
the
mists
of
an
ancient
youth
if
you
love
you
can
die
together
she
said
very
slowly
why
should
you
live
if
it
is
true
i
am
a
hundred
years
old
what
has
life
given
me
the
beginning
is
fire
the
end
is
a
heap
of
ashes
and
between
the
end
and
the
beginning
lies
all
the
pain
of
the
world
let
me
sleep
since
i
can
not
die
then
the
old
woman
eyes
closed
again
and
her
head
sank
a
little
lower
upon
her
breast
so
evelyn
went
away
and
left
her
asleep
with
the
cat
asleep
on
the
bag
footstool
and
the
young
girl
tried
to
forget
nurse
macdonald
words
but
she
could
not
for
she
heard
them
over
and
over
again
in
the
wind
and
behind
her
on
the
stairs
and
as
she
grew
sick
with
fear
of
the
frightful
unknown
evil
to
which
her
soul
was
bound
she
felt
a
bodily
something
pressing
her
and
pushing
her
and
forcing
her
on
and
from
the
other
side
she
felt
the
threads
that
drew
her
mysteriously
and
when
she
shut
her
eyes
she
saw
in
the
chapel
behind
the
altar
the
low
iron
door
through
which
she
must
pass
to
go
to
the
thing
and
as
she
lay
awake
at
night
she
drew
the
sheet
over
her
face
lest
she
should
see
shadows
on
the
wall
beckoning
to
her
and
the
sound
of
her
own
warm
breath
made
whisperings
in
her
ears
while
she
held
the
mattress
with
her
hands
to
keep
from
getting
up
and
going
to
the
chapel
it
would
have
been
easier
if
there
had
not
been
a
way
thither
through
the
library
by
a
door
which
was
never
locked
it
would
be
fearfully
easy
to
take
her
candle
and
go
softly
through
the
sleeping
house
and
the
key
of
the
vault
lay
under
the
altar
behind
a
stone
that
turned
she
knew
the
little
secret
she
could
go
alone
and
see
but
when
she
thought
of
it
she
felt
her
hair
rise
on
her
head
and
first
she
shivered
so
that
the
bed
shook
and
then
the
horror
went
through
her
in
a
cold
thrill
that
was
agony
again
like
myriads
of
icy
needles
boring
into
her
nerves
chapter
iv
the
old
clock
in
nurse
macdonald
tower
struck
midnight
from
her
room
she
could
hear
the
creaking
chains
and
weights
in
their
box
in
the
corner
of
the
staircase
and
overhead
the
jarring
of
the
rusty
lever
that
lifted
the
hammer
she
had
heard
it
all
her
life
it
struck
eleven
strokes
clearly
and
then
came
the
twelfth
with
a
dull
half
stroke
as
though
the
hammer
were
too
weary
to
go
on
and
had
fallen
asleep
against
the
bell
the
old
cat
got
up
from
the
bag
footstool
and
stretched
itself
and
nurse
macdonald
opened
her
ancient
eyes
and
looked
slowly
round
the
room
by
the
dim
light
of
the
night
lamp
she
touched
the
cat
with
her
and
it
lay
down
upon
her
feet
she
drank
a
few
drops
from
her
cup
and
went
to
sleep
again
but
downstairs
sir
gabriel
sat
straight
up
as
the
clock
struck
for
he
had
dreamed
a
fearful
dream
of
horror
and
his
heart
stood
still
till
he
awoke
at
its
stopping
and
it
beat
again
furiously
with
his
breath
like
a
wild
thing
set
free
no
ockram
had
ever
known
fear
waking
but
sometimes
it
came
to
sir
gabriel
in
his
sleep
he
pressed
his
hands
to
his
temples
as
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
his
hands
were
icy
cold
but
his
head
was
hot
the
dream
faded
far
and
in
its
place
there
came
the
master
thought
that
racked
his
life
with
the
thought
also
came
the
sick
twisting
of
his
lips
in
the
dark
that
would
have
been
a
smile
far
off
evelyn
warburton
dreamed
that
the
dead
smile
was
on
her
mouth
and
awoke
starting
with
a
little
moan
her
face
in
her
hands
shivering
but
sir
gabriel
struck
a
light
and
got
up
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
his
great
room
it
was
midnight
and
he
had
barely
slept
an
hour
and
in
the
north
of
ireland
the
winter
nights
are
long
i
shall
go
mad
he
said
to
himself
holding
his
forehead
he
knew
that
it
was
true
for
weeks
and
months
the
possession
of
the
thing
had
grown
upon
him
like
a
disease
till
he
could
think
of
nothing
without
thinking
first
of
that
and
now
all
at
once
it
outgrew
his
strength
and
he
knew
that
he
must
be
its
instrument
or
lose
his
mind
that
he
must
do
the
deed
he
hated
and
feared
if
he
could
fear
anything
or
that
something
would
snap
in
his
brain
and
divide
him
from
life
while
he
was
yet
alive
he
took
the
candlestick
in
his
hand
the
heavy
candlestick
that
had
always
been
used
by
the
head
of
the
house
he
did
not
think
of
dressing
but
went
as
he
was
in
his
silk
night
clothes
and
his
slippers
and
he
opened
the
door
everything
was
very
still
in
the
great
old
house
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
walked
noiselessly
on
the
carpet
through
the
long
corridor
a
cool
breeze
blew
over
his
shoulder
and
blew
the
flame
of
his
candle
straight
out
from
him
instinctively
he
stopped
and
looked
round
but
all
was
still
and
the
upright
flame
burned
steadily
he
walked
on
and
instantly
a
strong
draught
was
behind
him
almost
extinguishing
the
light
it
seemed
to
blow
him
on
his
way
ceasing
whenever
he
turned
coming
again
when
he
went
on
invisible
icy
down
the
great
staircase
to
the
echoing
hall
he
went
seeing
nothing
but
the
flaring
flame
of
the
candle
standing
away
from
him
over
the
guttering
wax
while
the
cold
wind
blew
over
his
shoulder
and
through
his
hair
on
he
passed
through
the
open
door
into
the
library
dark
with
old
books
and
carved
bookcases
on
through
the
door
in
the
shelves
with
painted
shelves
on
it
and
the
imitated
backs
of
books
so
that
one
needed
to
know
where
to
find
it
and
it
shut
itself
after
him
with
a
soft
click
he
entered
the
passage
and
though
the
door
was
shut
behind
him
and
fitted
tightly
in
its
frame
still
the
cold
breeze
blew
the
flame
forward
as
he
walked
and
he
was
not
afraid
but
his
face
was
very
pale
and
his
eyes
were
wide
and
bright
looking
before
him
seeing
already
in
the
dark
air
the
picture
of
the
thing
beyond
but
in
the
chapel
he
stood
still
his
hand
on
the
little
turning
stone
tablet
in
the
back
of
the
stone
altar
on
the
tablet
were
engraved
words
sepulchri
clarissimorum
dominorum
de
the
key
to
the
vault
of
the
most
illustrious
lords
of
ockram
sir
gabriel
paused
and
listened
he
fancied
that
he
heard
a
sound
far
off
in
the
great
house
where
all
had
been
so
still
but
it
did
not
come
again
yet
he
waited
at
the
last
and
looked
at
the
low
iron
door
beyond
it
down
the
long
descent
lay
his
father
uncoffined
six
months
dead
corrupt
terrible
in
his
clinging
shroud
the
strangely
preserving
air
of
the
vault
could
not
yet
have
done
its
work
completely
but
on
the
thing
ghastly
features
with
their
open
eyes
there
would
still
be
the
frightful
smile
with
which
the
man
had
died
the
smile
that
haunted
as
the
thought
crossed
sir
gabriel
mind
he
felt
his
lips
writhing
and
he
struck
his
own
mouth
in
wrath
with
the
back
of
his
hand
so
fiercely
that
a
drop
of
blood
ran
down
his
chin
and
another
and
more
falling
back
in
the
gloom
upon
the
chapel
pavement
but
still
his
bruised
lips
twisted
themselves
he
turned
the
tablet
by
the
simple
secret
it
needed
no
safer
fastening
for
had
each
ockram
been
coffined
in
pure
gold
and
had
the
door
been
open
wide
there
was
not
a
man
in
tyrone
brave
enough
to
go
down
to
that
place
saving
gabriel
ockram
himself
with
his
angel
face
and
his
thin
white
hands
and
his
sad
unflinching
eyes
he
took
the
great
old
key
and
set
it
into
the
lock
of
the
iron
door
and
the
heavy
rattling
noise
echoed
down
the
descent
beyond
like
footsteps
as
if
a
watcher
had
stood
behind
the
iron
and
were
running
away
within
with
heavy
dead
feet
and
though
he
was
standing
still
the
cool
wind
was
from
behind
him
and
blew
the
flame
of
the
candle
against
the
iron
panel
he
turned
the
key
sir
gabriel
saw
that
his
candle
was
short
there
were
new
ones
on
the
altar
with
long
candlesticks
and
he
lit
one
and
left
his
own
burning
on
the
floor
as
he
set
it
down
on
the
pavement
his
lip
began
to
bleed
again
and
another
drop
fell
upon
the
stones
he
drew
the
iron
door
open
and
pushed
it
back
against
the
chapel
wall
so
that
it
should
not
shut
of
itself
while
he
was
within
and
the
horrible
draught
of
the
sepulchre
came
up
out
of
the
depths
in
his
face
foul
and
dark
he
went
in
but
though
the
fetid
air
met
him
yet
the
flame
of
the
tall
candle
was
blown
straight
from
him
against
the
wind
while
he
walked
down
the
easy
incline
with
steady
steps
his
loose
slippers
slapping
the
pavement
as
he
trod
he
shaded
the
candle
with
his
hand
and
his
fingers
seemed
to
be
made
of
wax
and
blood
as
the
light
shone
through
them
and
in
spite
of
him
the
unearthly
draught
forced
the
flame
forward
till
it
was
blue
over
the
black
wick
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
go
out
but
he
went
straight
on
with
shining
eyes
the
downward
passage
was
wide
and
he
could
not
always
see
the
walls
by
the
struggling
light
but
he
knew
when
he
was
in
the
place
of
death
by
the
larger
drearier
echo
of
his
steps
in
the
greater
space
and
by
the
sensation
of
a
distant
blank
wall
he
stood
still
almost
enclosing
the
flame
of
the
candle
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
he
could
see
a
little
for
his
eyes
were
growing
used
to
the
gloom
shadowy
forms
were
outlined
in
the
dimness
where
the
biers
of
the
ockrams
stood
crowded
together
side
by
side
each
with
its
straight
shrouded
corpse
strangely
preserved
by
the
dry
air
like
the
empty
shell
that
the
locust
sheds
in
summer
and
a
few
steps
before
him
he
saw
clearly
the
dark
shape
of
headless
sir
vernon
iron
coffin
and
he
knew
that
nearest
to
it
lay
the
thing
he
sought
he
was
as
brave
as
any
of
those
dead
men
had
been
and
they
were
his
fathers
and
he
knew
that
sooner
or
later
he
should
lie
there
himself
beside
sir
hugh
slowly
drying
to
a
parchment
shell
but
he
was
still
alive
and
he
closed
his
eyes
a
moment
and
three
great
drops
stood
on
his
forehead
then
he
looked
again
and
by
the
whiteness
of
the
he
knew
his
father
corpse
for
all
the
others
were
brown
with
age
and
moreover
the
flame
of
the
candle
was
blown
toward
it
he
made
four
steps
till
he
reached
it
and
suddenly
the
light
burned
straight
and
high
shedding
a
dazzling
yellow
glare
upon
the
fine
linen
that
was
all
white
save
over
the
face
and
where
the
joined
hands
were
laid
on
the
breast
and
at
those
places
ugly
stains
had
spread
darkened
with
outlines
of
the
features
and
of
the
fingers
there
was
a
frightful
stench
of
drying
death
as
sir
gabriel
looked
down
something
stirred
behind
him
softly
at
first
then
more
noisily
and
something
fell
to
the
stone
floor
with
a
dull
thud
and
rolled
up
to
his
feet
he
started
back
and
saw
a
withered
head
lying
almost
face
upward
on
the
pavement
grinning
at
him
he
felt
the
cold
sweat
standing
on
his
face
and
his
heart
beat
painfully
for
the
first
time
in
all
his
life
that
evil
thing
which
men
call
fear
was
getting
hold
of
him
checking
his
as
a
cruel
driver
checks
a
quivering
horse
clawing
at
his
backbone
with
icy
hands
lifting
his
hair
with
freezing
breath
climbing
up
and
gathering
in
his
midriff
with
leaden
weight
yet
presently
he
bit
his
lip
and
bent
down
holding
the
candle
in
one
hand
to
lift
the
shroud
back
from
the
head
of
the
corpse
with
the
other
slowly
he
lifted
it
then
it
clove
to
the
skin
of
the
face
and
his
hand
shook
as
if
some
one
had
struck
him
on
the
elbow
but
half
in
fear
and
half
in
anger
at
himself
he
pulled
it
so
that
it
came
away
with
a
little
ripping
sound
he
caught
his
breath
as
he
held
it
not
yet
throwing
it
back
and
not
yet
looking
the
horror
was
working
in
him
and
he
felt
that
old
vernon
ockram
was
standing
up
in
his
iron
coffin
headless
yet
watching
him
with
the
stump
of
his
severed
neck
while
he
held
his
breath
he
felt
the
dead
smile
twisting
his
lips
in
sudden
wrath
at
his
own
misery
he
tossed
the
linen
backward
and
looked
at
last
he
ground
his
teeth
lest
he
should
shriek
aloud
there
it
was
the
thing
that
haunted
him
that
haunted
evelyn
warburton
that
was
like
a
blight
on
all
that
came
near
him
the
dead
face
was
blotched
with
dark
stains
and
the
thin
grey
hair
was
matted
about
the
discoloured
forehead
the
sunken
lids
were
half
open
and
the
candle
light
gleamed
on
something
foul
where
the
toad
eyes
had
lived
but
yet
the
dead
thing
smiled
as
it
had
smiled
in
life
the
ghastly
lips
were
parted
and
drawn
wide
and
tight
upon
the
wolfish
teeth
cursing
still
and
still
defying
hell
to
do
its
worst
defying
cursing
and
always
and
for
ever
smiling
alone
in
the
dark
sir
gabriel
opened
the
where
the
hands
were
and
the
blackened
withered
fingers
were
closed
upon
something
stained
and
mottled
shivering
from
head
to
foot
but
fighting
like
a
man
in
agony
for
his
life
he
tried
to
take
the
package
from
the
dead
man
hold
but
as
he
pulled
at
it
the
fingers
seemed
to
close
more
tightly
and
when
he
pulled
harder
the
shrunken
hands
and
arms
rose
from
the
corpse
with
a
horrible
look
of
life
following
his
motion
then
as
he
wrenched
the
sealed
packet
loose
at
last
the
hands
fell
back
into
their
place
still
folded
he
set
down
the
candle
on
the
edge
of
the
bier
to
break
the
seals
from
the
stout
paper
and
kneeling
on
one
knee
to
get
a
better
light
he
read
what
was
within
written
long
ago
in
sir
hugh
queer
hand
he
was
no
longer
afraid
he
read
how
sir
hugh
had
written
it
all
down
that
it
might
perchance
be
a
witness
of
evil
and
of
his
hatred
how
he
had
loved
evelyn
warburton
his
wife
sister
and
how
his
wife
had
died
of
a
broken
heart
with
his
curse
upon
her
and
how
warburton
and
he
had
fought
side
by
side
in
afghanistan
and
warburton
had
fallen
but
ockram
had
brought
his
comrade
wife
back
a
full
year
later
and
little
evelyn
her
child
had
been
born
in
ockram
hall
and
next
how
he
had
wearied
of
the
mother
and
she
had
died
like
her
sister
with
his
curse
on
her
and
then
how
evelyn
had
been
brought
up
as
his
niece
and
how
he
had
trusted
that
his
son
gabriel
and
his
daughter
innocent
and
unknowing
might
love
and
marry
and
the
souls
of
the
women
he
had
betrayed
might
suffer
another
anguish
before
eternity
was
out
and
last
of
all
he
hoped
that
some
day
when
nothing
could
be
undone
the
two
might
find
his
writing
and
live
on
not
daring
to
tell
the
truth
for
their
children
sake
and
the
world
word
man
and
wife
this
he
read
kneeling
beside
the
corpse
in
the
north
vault
by
the
light
of
the
altar
candle
and
when
he
had
read
it
all
he
thanked
god
aloud
that
he
had
found
the
secret
in
time
but
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
down
at
the
dead
face
it
was
changed
and
the
smile
was
gone
from
it
for
ever
and
the
jaw
had
fallen
a
little
and
the
tired
dead
lips
were
relaxed
and
then
there
was
a
breath
behind
him
and
close
to
him
not
cold
like
that
which
had
blown
the
flame
of
the
candle
as
he
came
but
warm
and
human
he
turned
suddenly
there
she
stood
all
in
white
with
her
shadowy
golden
hair
for
she
had
risen
from
her
bed
and
had
followed
him
noiselessly
and
had
found
him
reading
and
had
herself
read
over
his
shoulder
he
started
violently
when
he
saw
her
for
his
nerves
were
unstrung
and
then
he
cried
out
her
name
in
the
still
place
of
death
evelyn
my
brother
she
answered
softly
and
tenderly
putting
out
both
hands
to
meet
his
the
screaming
skull
i
have
often
heard
it
scream
no
i
am
not
nervous
i
am
not
imaginative
and
i
never
believed
in
ghosts
unless
that
thing
is
one
whatever
it
is
it
hates
me
almost
as
much
as
it
hated
luke
pratt
and
it
screams
at
me
if
i
were
you
i
would
never
tell
ugly
stories
about
ingenious
ways
of
killing
people
for
you
never
can
tell
but
that
some
one
at
the
table
may
be
tired
of
his
or
her
nearest
and
dearest
i
have
always
blamed
myself
for
pratt
death
and
i
suppose
i
was
responsible
for
it
in
a
way
though
heaven
knows
i
never
wished
her
anything
but
long
life
and
happiness
if
i
had
not
told
that
story
she
might
be
alive
yet
that
is
why
the
thing
screams
at
me
i
fancy
she
was
a
good
little
woman
with
a
sweet
temper
all
things
considered
and
a
nice
gentle
voice
but
i
remember
hearing
her
shriek
once
when
she
thought
her
little
boy
was
killed
by
a
pistol
that
went
off
though
every
one
was
sure
that
it
was
not
loaded
it
was
the
same
scream
exactly
the
same
with
a
sort
of
rising
quaver
at
the
end
do
you
know
what
i
mean
unmistakable
the
truth
is
i
had
not
realised
that
the
doctor
and
his
wife
were
not
on
good
terms
they
used
to
bicker
a
bit
now
and
then
when
i
was
here
and
i
often
noticed
that
little
pratt
got
very
red
and
bit
her
lip
hard
to
keep
her
temper
while
luke
grew
pale
and
said
the
most
offensive
things
he
was
that
sort
when
he
was
in
the
nursery
i
remember
and
afterward
at
school
he
was
my
cousin
you
know
that
is
how
i
came
by
this
house
after
he
died
and
his
boy
charley
was
killed
in
south
africa
there
were
no
relations
left
yes
it
a
pretty
little
property
just
the
sort
of
thing
for
an
old
sailor
like
me
who
has
taken
to
gardening
one
always
remembers
one
mistakes
much
more
vividly
than
cleverest
things
does
one
i
often
noticed
it
i
was
dining
with
the
pratts
one
night
when
i
told
them
the
story
that
afterwards
made
so
much
difference
it
was
a
wet
night
in
november
and
the
sea
was
moaning
hush
if
you
do
speak
you
will
hear
it
now
do
you
hear
the
tide
gloomy
sound
is
it
sometimes
about
this
time
of
year
hallo
there
it
is
do
be
frightened
man
it
wo
eat
you
it
only
a
noise
after
all
but
i
glad
you
heard
it
because
there
are
always
people
who
think
it
the
wind
or
my
imagination
or
something
you
wo
hear
it
again
i
fancy
for
it
does
often
come
more
than
once
yes
that
right
put
another
stick
on
the
fire
and
a
little
more
stuff
into
that
weak
mixture
so
fond
of
do
you
remember
old
blauklot
the
carpenter
on
that
german
ship
that
picked
us
up
when
the
went
to
the
bottom
we
were
hove
to
in
a
howling
gale
one
night
as
snug
as
you
please
with
no
land
within
five
hundred
miles
and
the
ship
coming
up
and
falling
off
as
regularly
as
clockwork
biddy
te
boor
beebles
ashore
tis
night
poys
old
blauklot
sang
out
as
he
went
off
to
his
quarters
with
the
i
often
think
of
that
now
that
i
ashore
for
good
and
all
yes
it
was
on
a
night
like
this
when
i
was
at
home
for
a
spell
waiting
to
take
the
out
on
her
first
trip
it
was
on
the
next
voyage
that
she
broke
the
record
you
remember
but
that
dates
it
was
the
year
early
in
november
the
weather
was
dirty
pratt
was
out
of
temper
and
the
dinner
was
bad
very
bad
indeed
which
did
improve
matters
and
cold
which
made
it
worse
the
poor
little
lady
was
very
unhappy
about
it
and
insisted
on
making
a
welsh
rarebit
on
the
table
to
counteract
the
raw
turnips
and
the
mutton
pratt
must
have
had
a
hard
day
perhaps
he
had
lost
a
patient
at
all
events
he
was
in
a
nasty
temper
my
wife
is
trying
to
poison
me
you
see
he
said
she
succeed
some
day
i
saw
that
she
was
hurt
and
i
made
believe
to
laugh
and
said
that
pratt
was
much
too
clever
to
get
rid
of
her
husband
in
such
a
simple
way
and
then
i
began
to
tell
them
about
japanese
tricks
with
spun
glass
and
chopped
horsehair
and
the
like
pratt
was
a
doctor
and
knew
a
lot
more
than
i
did
about
such
things
but
that
only
put
me
on
my
mettle
and
i
told
a
story
about
a
woman
in
ireland
who
did
for
three
husbands
before
any
one
suspected
foul
play
did
you
never
hear
that
tale
the
fourth
husband
managed
to
keep
awake
and
caught
her
and
she
was
hanged
how
did
she
do
it
she
drugged
them
and
poured
melted
lead
into
their
ears
through
a
little
horn
funnel
when
they
were
asleep
no
that
the
wind
whistling
it
backing
up
to
the
southward
again
i
can
tell
by
the
sound
besides
the
other
thing
does
often
come
more
than
once
in
an
evening
even
at
this
time
of
year
when
it
happened
yes
it
was
in
november
poor
pratt
died
suddenly
in
her
bed
not
long
after
i
dined
here
i
can
fix
the
date
because
i
got
the
news
in
new
york
by
the
steamer
that
followed
the
when
i
took
her
out
on
her
first
trip
you
had
the
the
same
year
yes
i
remember
what
a
pair
of
old
buffers
we
are
coming
to
be
you
and
i
nearly
fifty
years
since
we
were
apprentices
together
on
the
shall
you
ever
forget
old
blauklot
biddy
te
boor
beebles
ashore
poys
ha
ha
take
a
little
more
with
all
that
water
it
the
old
hulstkamp
i
found
in
the
cellar
when
this
house
came
to
me
the
same
i
brought
luke
from
amsterdam
years
ago
he
had
never
touched
a
drop
of
it
perhaps
he
sorry
now
poor
fellow
where
did
i
leave
off
i
told
you
that
pratt
died
suddenly
yes
luke
must
have
been
lonely
here
after
she
was
dead
i
should
think
i
came
to
see
him
now
and
then
and
he
looked
worn
and
nervous
and
told
me
that
his
practice
was
growing
too
heavy
for
him
though
he
take
an
assistant
on
any
account
years
went
on
and
his
son
was
killed
in
south
africa
and
after
that
he
began
to
be
queer
there
was
something
about
him
not
like
other
people
i
believe
he
kept
his
senses
in
his
profession
to
the
end
there
was
no
complaint
of
his
having
made
bad
mistakes
in
cases
or
anything
of
that
sort
but
he
had
a
look
about
him
luke
was
a
man
with
a
pale
face
when
he
was
young
and
he
was
never
stout
in
middle
age
he
turned
a
sandy
grey
and
after
his
son
died
he
grew
thinner
and
thinner
till
his
head
looked
like
a
skull
with
parchment
stretched
over
it
very
tight
and
his
eyes
had
a
sort
of
glare
in
them
that
was
very
disagreeable
to
look
at
he
had
an
old
dog
that
poor
pratt
had
been
fond
of
and
that
used
to
follow
her
everywhere
he
was
a
and
the
sweetest
tempered
beast
you
ever
saw
though
he
had
a
way
of
hitching
his
upper
lip
behind
one
of
his
fangs
that
frightened
strangers
a
good
deal
sometimes
of
an
evening
pratt
and
bumble
that
was
the
dog
name
used
to
sit
and
look
at
each
other
a
long
time
thinking
about
old
times
i
suppose
when
luke
wife
used
to
sit
in
that
chair
you
got
that
was
always
her
place
and
this
was
the
doctor
where
i
sitting
bumble
used
to
climb
up
by
the
footstool
he
was
old
and
fat
by
that
time
and
could
not
jump
much
and
his
teeth
were
getting
shaky
he
would
look
steadily
at
luke
and
luke
looked
steadily
at
the
dog
his
face
growing
more
and
more
like
a
skull
with
two
little
coals
for
eyes
and
after
about
five
minutes
or
so
though
it
may
have
been
less
old
bumble
would
suddenly
begin
to
shake
all
over
and
all
on
a
sudden
he
would
set
up
an
awful
howl
as
if
he
had
been
shot
and
tumble
out
of
the
and
trot
away
and
hide
himself
under
the
sideboard
and
lie
there
making
odd
noises
considering
pratt
looks
in
those
last
months
the
thing
is
not
surprising
you
know
i
not
nervous
or
imaginative
but
i
can
quite
believe
he
might
have
sent
a
sensitive
woman
into
hysterics
his
head
looked
so
much
like
a
skull
in
parchment
at
last
i
came
down
one
day
before
christmas
when
my
ship
was
in
dock
and
i
had
three
weeks
off
bumble
was
not
about
and
i
said
casually
that
i
supposed
the
old
dog
was
dead
yes
pratt
answered
and
i
thought
there
was
something
odd
in
his
tone
even
before
he
went
on
after
a
little
pause
i
killed
him
he
said
presently
i
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
i
asked
what
it
was
that
luke
could
not
stand
though
i
guessed
well
enough
he
had
a
way
of
sitting
in
her
chair
and
glaring
at
me
and
then
howling
luke
shivered
a
little
he
did
suffer
at
all
poor
old
bumble
he
went
on
in
a
hurry
as
if
he
thought
i
might
imagine
he
had
been
cruel
i
put
dionine
into
his
drink
to
make
him
sleep
soundly
and
then
i
chloroformed
him
gradually
so
that
he
could
not
have
felt
suffocated
even
if
he
was
dreaming
it
been
quieter
since
then
i
wondered
what
he
meant
for
the
words
slipped
out
as
if
he
could
not
help
saying
them
i
understood
since
he
meant
that
he
did
not
hear
that
noise
so
often
after
the
dog
was
out
of
the
way
perhaps
he
thought
at
first
that
it
was
old
bumble
in
the
yard
howling
at
the
moon
though
it
not
that
kind
of
noise
is
it
besides
i
know
what
it
is
if
luke
did
it
only
a
noise
after
all
and
a
noise
never
hurt
anybody
yet
but
he
was
much
more
imaginative
than
i
am
no
doubt
there
really
is
something
about
this
place
that
i
do
understand
but
when
i
understand
a
thing
i
call
it
a
phenomenon
and
i
do
take
it
for
granted
that
it
going
to
kill
me
as
he
did
i
do
understand
everything
by
long
odds
nor
do
you
nor
does
any
man
who
has
been
to
sea
we
used
to
talk
of
tidal
waves
for
instance
and
we
could
not
account
for
them
now
we
account
for
them
by
calling
them
submarine
earthquakes
and
we
branch
off
into
fifty
theories
any
one
of
which
might
make
earthquakes
quite
comprehensible
if
we
only
knew
what
they
are
i
fell
in
with
one
of
them
once
and
the
inkstand
flew
straight
up
from
the
table
against
the
ceiling
of
my
cabin
the
same
thing
happened
to
captain
lecky
i
dare
say
you
read
about
it
in
his
wrinkles
very
good
if
that
sort
of
thing
took
place
ashore
in
this
room
for
instance
a
nervous
person
would
talk
about
spirits
and
levitation
and
fifty
things
that
mean
nothing
instead
of
just
quietly
setting
it
down
as
a
phenomenon
that
has
not
been
explained
yet
my
view
of
that
voice
you
see
besides
what
is
there
to
prove
that
luke
killed
his
wife
i
would
not
even
suggest
such
a
thing
to
any
one
but
you
after
all
there
was
nothing
but
the
coincidence
that
poor
little
pratt
died
suddenly
in
her
bed
a
few
days
after
i
told
that
story
at
dinner
she
was
not
the
only
woman
who
ever
died
like
that
luke
got
the
doctor
over
from
the
next
parish
and
they
agreed
that
she
had
died
of
something
the
matter
with
her
heart
why
not
it
common
enough
of
course
there
was
the
ladle
i
never
told
anybody
about
that
and
it
made
me
start
when
i
found
it
in
the
cupboard
in
the
bedroom
it
was
new
too
a
little
tinned
iron
ladle
that
had
not
been
in
the
fire
more
than
once
or
twice
and
there
was
some
lead
in
it
that
had
been
melted
and
stuck
to
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
all
grey
with
hardened
dross
on
it
but
that
proves
nothing
a
country
doctor
is
generally
a
handy
man
who
does
everything
for
himself
and
luke
may
have
had
a
dozen
reasons
for
melting
a
little
lead
in
a
ladle
he
was
fond
of
for
instance
and
he
may
have
cast
a
sinker
for
a
perhaps
it
was
a
weight
for
the
hall
clock
or
something
like
that
all
the
same
when
i
found
it
i
had
a
rather
queer
sensation
because
it
looked
so
much
like
the
thing
i
had
described
when
i
told
them
the
story
do
you
understand
it
affected
me
unpleasantly
and
i
threw
it
away
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
a
mile
from
the
spit
and
it
will
be
jolly
well
rusted
beyond
recognising
if
it
ever
washed
up
by
the
tide
you
see
luke
must
have
bought
it
in
the
village
years
ago
for
the
man
sells
just
such
ladles
still
i
suppose
they
are
used
in
cooking
in
any
case
there
was
no
reason
why
an
inquisitive
housemaid
should
find
such
a
thing
lying
about
with
lead
in
it
and
wonder
what
it
was
and
perhaps
talk
to
the
maid
who
heard
me
tell
the
story
at
dinner
for
that
girl
married
the
plumber
son
in
the
village
and
may
remember
the
whole
thing
you
understand
me
do
you
now
that
luke
pratt
is
dead
and
gone
and
lies
buried
beside
his
wife
with
an
honest
man
tombstone
at
his
head
i
should
not
care
to
stir
up
anything
that
could
hurt
his
memory
they
are
both
dead
and
their
son
too
there
was
trouble
enough
about
death
as
it
was
how
he
was
found
dead
on
the
beach
one
morning
and
there
was
a
coroner
inquest
there
were
marks
on
his
throat
but
he
had
not
been
robbed
the
verdict
was
that
he
had
come
to
his
end
by
the
hands
or
teeth
of
some
person
or
animal
unknown
for
half
the
jury
thought
it
might
have
been
a
big
dog
that
had
thrown
him
down
and
gripped
his
windpipe
though
the
skin
of
his
throat
was
not
broken
no
one
knew
at
what
time
he
had
gone
out
nor
where
he
had
been
he
was
found
lying
on
his
back
above
mark
and
an
old
cardboard
bandbox
that
had
belonged
to
his
wife
lay
under
his
hand
open
the
lid
had
fallen
off
he
seemed
to
have
been
carrying
home
a
skull
in
the
box
doctors
are
fond
of
collecting
such
things
it
had
rolled
out
and
lay
near
his
head
and
it
was
a
remarkably
fine
skull
rather
small
beautifully
shaped
and
very
white
with
perfect
teeth
that
is
to
say
the
upper
jaw
was
perfect
but
there
was
no
lower
one
at
all
when
i
first
saw
it
yes
i
found
it
here
when
i
came
you
see
it
was
very
white
and
polished
like
a
thing
meant
to
be
kept
under
a
glass
case
and
the
people
did
not
know
where
it
came
from
nor
what
to
do
with
it
so
they
put
it
back
into
the
bandbox
and
set
it
on
the
shelf
of
the
cupboard
in
the
best
bedroom
and
of
course
they
showed
it
to
me
when
i
took
possession
i
was
taken
down
to
the
beach
too
to
be
shown
the
place
where
luke
was
found
and
the
old
fisherman
explained
just
how
he
was
lying
and
the
skull
beside
him
the
only
point
he
could
not
explain
was
why
the
skull
had
rolled
up
the
sloping
sand
toward
luke
head
instead
of
rolling
downhill
to
his
feet
it
did
not
seem
odd
to
me
at
the
time
but
i
have
often
thought
of
it
since
for
the
place
is
rather
steep
i
take
you
there
if
you
like
i
made
a
sort
of
cairn
of
stones
there
afterward
when
he
fell
down
or
was
thrown
down
whichever
happened
the
bandbox
struck
the
sand
and
the
lid
came
off
and
the
thing
came
out
and
ought
to
have
rolled
down
but
it
did
it
was
close
to
his
head
almost
touching
it
and
turned
with
the
face
toward
it
i
say
it
did
strike
me
as
odd
when
the
man
told
me
but
i
could
not
help
thinking
about
it
afterward
again
and
again
till
i
saw
a
picture
of
it
all
when
i
closed
my
eyes
and
then
i
began
to
ask
myself
why
the
plaguey
thing
had
rolled
up
instead
of
down
and
why
it
had
stopped
near
luke
head
instead
of
anywhere
else
a
yard
away
for
instance
you
naturally
want
to
know
what
conclusion
i
reached
do
you
none
that
at
all
explained
the
rolling
at
all
events
but
i
got
something
else
into
my
head
after
a
time
that
made
me
feel
downright
uncomfortable
oh
i
do
mean
as
to
anything
supernatural
there
may
be
ghosts
or
there
may
not
be
if
there
are
i
not
inclined
to
believe
that
they
can
hurt
living
people
except
by
frightening
them
and
for
my
part
i
would
rather
face
any
shape
of
ghost
than
a
fog
in
the
channel
when
crowded
no
what
bothered
me
was
just
a
foolish
idea
that
all
and
i
can
not
tell
how
it
began
nor
what
made
it
grow
till
it
turned
into
a
certainty
i
was
thinking
about
luke
and
his
poor
wife
one
evening
over
my
pipe
and
a
dull
book
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
skull
might
possibly
be
hers
and
i
have
never
got
rid
of
the
thought
since
you
tell
me
there
no
sense
in
it
no
doubt
that
pratt
was
buried
like
a
christian
and
is
lying
in
the
churchyard
where
they
put
her
and
that
it
perfectly
monstrous
to
suppose
her
husband
kept
her
skull
in
her
old
bandbox
in
his
bedroom
all
the
same
in
the
face
of
reason
and
common
sense
and
probability
i
convinced
that
he
did
doctors
do
all
sorts
of
queer
things
that
would
make
men
like
you
and
me
feel
creepy
and
those
are
just
the
things
that
do
seem
probable
nor
logical
nor
sensible
to
us
then
do
you
see
if
it
really
was
her
skull
poor
woman
the
only
way
of
accounting
for
his
having
it
is
that
he
really
killed
her
and
did
it
in
that
way
as
the
woman
killed
her
husbands
in
the
story
and
that
he
was
afraid
there
might
be
an
examination
some
day
which
would
betray
him
you
see
i
told
that
too
and
i
believe
it
had
really
happened
some
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
they
dug
up
the
three
skulls
you
know
and
there
was
a
small
lump
of
lead
rattling
about
in
each
one
that
was
what
hanged
the
woman
luke
remembered
that
i
sure
i
want
to
know
what
he
did
when
he
thought
of
it
my
taste
never
ran
in
the
direction
of
horrors
and
i
do
fancy
you
care
for
them
either
do
you
no
if
you
did
you
might
supply
what
is
wanting
to
the
story
it
must
have
been
rather
grim
eh
i
wish
i
did
not
see
the
whole
thing
so
distinctly
just
as
everything
must
have
happened
he
took
it
the
night
before
she
was
buried
i
sure
after
the
coffin
had
been
shut
and
when
the
servant
girl
was
asleep
i
would
bet
anything
that
when
he
got
it
he
put
something
under
the
sheet
in
its
place
to
fill
up
and
look
like
it
what
do
you
suppose
he
put
there
under
the
sheet
i
do
wonder
you
take
me
up
on
what
i
saying
first
i
tell
you
that
i
do
want
to
know
what
happened
and
that
i
hate
to
think
about
horrors
and
then
i
describe
the
whole
thing
to
you
as
if
i
had
seen
it
i
quite
sure
that
it
was
her
that
he
put
there
i
remember
the
bag
very
well
for
she
always
used
it
of
an
evening
it
was
made
of
brown
plush
and
when
it
was
stuffed
full
it
was
about
the
size
of
you
understand
yes
there
i
am
at
it
again
you
may
laugh
at
me
but
you
do
live
here
alone
where
it
was
done
and
you
did
tell
luke
the
story
about
the
melted
lead
i
not
nervous
i
tell
you
but
sometimes
i
begin
to
feel
that
i
understand
why
some
people
are
i
dwell
on
all
this
when
i
alone
and
i
dream
of
it
and
when
that
thing
screams
well
frankly
i
do
like
the
noise
any
more
than
you
do
though
i
should
be
used
to
it
by
this
time
i
ought
not
to
be
nervous
i
sailed
in
a
haunted
ship
there
was
a
man
in
the
top
and
of
the
crew
died
of
the
west
coast
fever
inside
of
ten
days
after
we
anchored
but
i
was
all
right
then
and
afterward
i
have
seen
some
ugly
sights
too
just
as
you
have
and
all
the
rest
of
us
but
nothing
ever
stuck
in
my
head
in
the
way
this
does
you
see
i
tried
to
get
rid
of
the
thing
but
it
does
like
that
it
wants
to
be
there
in
its
place
in
pratt
bandbox
in
the
cupboard
in
the
best
bedroom
it
not
happy
anywhere
else
how
do
i
know
that
because
i
tried
it
you
do
suppose
that
i
not
tried
do
you
as
long
as
it
there
it
only
screams
now
and
then
generally
at
this
time
of
year
but
if
i
put
it
out
of
the
house
it
goes
on
all
night
and
no
servant
will
stay
here
hours
as
it
is
often
been
left
alone
and
have
been
obliged
to
shift
for
myself
for
a
fortnight
at
a
time
no
one
from
the
village
would
ever
pass
a
night
under
the
roof
now
and
as
for
selling
the
place
or
even
letting
it
that
out
of
the
question
the
old
women
say
that
if
i
stay
here
i
shall
come
to
a
bad
end
myself
before
long
i
not
afraid
of
that
you
smile
at
the
mere
idea
that
any
one
could
take
such
nonsense
seriously
quite
right
it
utterly
blatant
nonsense
i
agree
with
you
did
i
tell
you
that
it
only
a
noise
after
all
when
you
started
and
looked
round
as
if
you
expected
to
see
a
ghost
standing
behind
your
chair
i
may
be
all
wrong
about
the
skull
and
i
like
to
think
that
i
am
when
i
can
it
may
be
just
a
fine
specimen
which
luke
got
somewhere
long
ago
and
what
rattles
about
inside
when
you
shake
it
may
be
nothing
but
a
pebble
or
a
bit
of
hard
clay
or
anything
skulls
that
have
lain
long
in
the
ground
generally
have
something
inside
them
that
rattles
they
no
i
never
tried
to
get
it
out
whatever
it
is
i
afraid
it
might
be
lead
do
you
see
and
if
it
is
i
do
want
to
know
the
fact
for
i
much
rather
not
be
sure
if
it
really
is
lead
i
killed
her
quite
as
much
as
if
i
had
done
the
deed
myself
anybody
must
see
that
i
should
think
as
long
as
i
do
know
for
certain
i
have
the
consolation
of
saying
that
it
all
utterly
ridiculous
nonsense
that
pratt
died
a
natural
death
and
that
the
beautiful
skull
belonged
to
luke
when
he
was
a
student
in
london
but
if
i
were
quite
sure
i
believe
i
should
have
to
leave
the
house
indeed
i
do
most
certainly
as
it
is
i
had
to
give
up
trying
to
sleep
in
the
best
bedroom
where
the
cupboard
is
you
ask
me
why
i
do
throw
it
into
the
pond
yes
but
please
call
it
a
confounded
bugbear
it
does
like
being
called
names
there
lord
what
a
shriek
i
told
you
so
you
quite
pale
man
fill
up
your
pipe
and
draw
your
chair
nearer
to
the
fire
and
take
some
more
drink
old
hollands
never
hurt
anybody
yet
i
seen
a
dutchman
in
java
drink
half
a
jug
of
hulstkamp
in
a
morning
without
turning
a
hair
i
do
take
much
rum
myself
because
it
does
agree
with
my
rheumatism
but
you
are
not
rheumatic
and
it
wo
damage
you
besides
it
a
very
damp
night
outside
the
wind
is
howling
again
and
it
will
soon
be
in
the
southwest
do
you
hear
how
the
windows
rattle
the
tide
must
have
turned
too
by
the
moaning
we
should
not
have
heard
the
thing
again
if
you
had
not
said
that
pretty
sure
we
should
not
oh
yes
if
you
choose
to
describe
it
as
a
coincidence
you
are
quite
welcome
but
i
would
rather
that
you
should
not
call
the
thing
names
again
if
you
do
mind
it
may
be
that
the
poor
little
woman
hears
and
perhaps
it
hurts
her
do
you
know
ghost
no
you
do
call
anything
a
ghost
that
you
can
take
in
your
hands
and
look
at
in
broad
daylight
and
that
rattles
when
you
shake
it
do
you
now
but
it
something
that
hears
and
understands
there
no
doubt
about
that
i
tried
sleeping
in
the
best
bedroom
when
i
first
came
to
the
house
just
because
it
was
the
best
and
the
most
comfortable
but
i
had
to
give
it
up
it
was
their
room
and
there
the
big
bed
she
died
in
and
the
cupboard
is
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
near
the
head
on
the
left
that
where
it
likes
to
be
kept
in
its
bandbox
i
only
used
the
room
for
a
fortnight
after
i
came
and
then
i
turned
out
and
took
the
little
room
downstairs
next
to
the
surgery
where
luke
used
to
sleep
when
he
expected
to
be
called
to
a
patient
during
the
night
i
was
always
a
good
sleeper
ashore
eight
hours
is
my
dose
eleven
to
seven
when
i
alone
twelve
to
eight
when
i
have
a
friend
with
me
but
i
could
not
sleep
after
three
in
the
morning
in
that
room
a
quarter
past
to
be
accurate
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
timed
it
with
my
old
pocket
chronometer
which
still
keeps
good
time
and
it
was
always
at
exactly
seventeen
minutes
past
three
i
wonder
whether
that
was
the
hour
when
she
died
it
was
not
what
you
have
heard
if
it
had
been
that
i
could
not
have
stood
it
two
nights
it
was
just
a
start
and
a
moan
and
hard
breathing
for
a
few
seconds
in
the
cupboard
and
it
could
never
have
waked
me
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
sure
i
suppose
you
are
like
me
in
that
and
we
are
just
like
other
people
who
have
been
to
sea
no
natural
sounds
disturb
us
at
all
not
all
the
racket
of
a
hove
to
in
a
heavy
gale
or
rolling
on
her
beam
ends
before
the
wind
but
if
a
lead
pencil
gets
adrift
and
rattles
in
the
drawer
of
your
cabin
table
you
are
awake
in
a
moment
just
so
you
always
understand
very
well
the
noise
in
the
cupboard
was
no
louder
than
that
but
it
waked
me
instantly
i
said
it
was
like
a
start
i
know
what
i
mean
but
it
hard
to
explain
without
seeming
to
talk
nonsense
of
course
you
can
not
exactly
hear
a
person
start
at
the
most
you
might
hear
the
quick
drawing
of
the
breath
between
the
parted
lips
and
closed
teeth
and
the
almost
imperceptible
sound
of
clothing
that
moved
suddenly
though
very
slightly
it
was
like
that
you
know
how
one
feels
what
a
sailing
vessel
is
going
to
do
two
or
three
seconds
before
she
does
it
when
one
has
the
wheel
riders
say
the
same
of
a
horse
but
that
less
strange
because
the
horse
is
a
live
animal
with
feelings
of
its
own
and
only
poets
and
landsmen
talk
about
a
ship
being
alive
and
all
that
but
i
have
always
felt
somehow
that
besides
being
a
steaming
machine
or
a
sailing
machine
for
carrying
weights
a
vessel
at
sea
is
a
sensitive
instrument
and
a
means
of
communication
between
nature
and
man
and
most
particularly
the
man
at
the
wheel
if
she
is
steered
by
hand
she
takes
her
impressions
directly
from
wind
and
sea
tide
and
stream
and
transmits
them
to
the
hand
just
as
the
wireless
telegraph
picks
up
the
interrupted
currents
aloft
and
turns
them
out
below
in
the
form
of
a
message
you
see
what
i
am
driving
at
i
felt
that
something
started
in
the
cupboard
and
i
felt
it
so
vividly
that
i
heard
it
though
there
may
have
been
nothing
to
hear
and
the
sound
inside
my
head
waked
me
suddenly
but
i
really
heard
the
other
noise
it
was
as
if
it
were
muffled
inside
a
box
as
far
away
as
if
it
came
through
a
telephone
and
yet
i
knew
that
it
was
inside
the
cupboard
near
the
head
of
my
bed
my
hair
did
not
bristle
and
my
blood
did
not
run
cold
that
time
i
simply
resented
being
waked
up
by
something
that
had
no
business
to
make
a
noise
any
more
than
a
pencil
should
rattle
in
the
drawer
of
my
cabin
table
on
board
ship
for
i
did
not
understand
i
just
supposed
that
the
cupboard
had
some
communication
with
the
outside
air
and
that
the
wind
had
got
in
and
was
moaning
through
it
with
a
sort
of
very
faint
screech
i
struck
a
light
and
looked
at
my
watch
and
it
was
seventeen
minutes
past
three
then
i
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
on
my
right
ear
that
my
good
one
i
pretty
deaf
with
the
other
for
i
struck
the
water
with
it
when
i
was
a
lad
in
diving
from
the
foretopsail
yard
silly
thing
to
do
it
was
but
the
result
is
very
convenient
when
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
when
there
a
noise
that
was
the
first
night
and
the
same
thing
happened
again
and
several
times
afterward
but
not
regularly
though
it
was
always
at
the
same
time
to
a
second
perhaps
i
was
sometimes
sleeping
on
my
good
ear
and
sometimes
not
i
overhauled
the
cupboard
and
there
was
no
way
by
which
the
wind
could
get
in
or
anything
else
for
the
door
makes
a
good
fit
having
been
meant
to
keep
out
moths
i
suppose
pratt
must
have
kept
her
winter
things
in
it
for
it
still
smells
of
camphor
and
turpentine
after
about
a
fortnight
i
had
had
enough
of
the
noises
so
far
i
had
said
to
myself
that
it
would
be
silly
to
yield
to
it
and
take
the
skull
out
of
the
room
things
always
look
differently
by
daylight
do
they
but
the
voice
grew
louder
i
suppose
one
may
call
it
a
voice
and
it
got
inside
my
deaf
ear
too
one
night
i
realised
that
when
i
was
wide
awake
for
my
good
ear
was
jammed
down
on
the
pillow
and
i
ought
not
to
have
heard
a
in
that
position
but
i
heard
that
and
it
made
me
lose
my
temper
unless
it
scared
me
for
sometimes
the
two
are
not
far
apart
i
struck
a
light
and
got
up
and
i
opened
the
cupboard
grabbed
the
bandbox
and
threw
it
out
of
the
window
as
far
as
i
could
then
my
hair
stood
on
end
the
thing
screamed
in
the
air
like
a
shell
from
a
gun
it
fell
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
the
night
was
very
dark
and
i
could
not
see
it
fall
but
i
know
it
fell
beyond
the
road
the
window
is
just
over
the
front
door
it
fifteen
yards
to
the
fence
more
or
less
and
the
road
is
ten
yards
wide
there
a
quickset
hedge
beyond
along
the
glebe
that
belongs
to
the
vicarage
i
did
not
sleep
much
more
that
night
it
was
not
more
than
half
an
hour
after
i
had
thrown
the
bandbox
out
when
i
heard
a
shriek
outside
like
what
we
had
but
worse
more
despairing
i
should
call
it
and
it
may
have
been
my
imagination
but
i
could
have
sworn
that
the
screams
came
nearer
and
nearer
each
time
i
lit
a
pipe
and
walked
up
and
down
for
a
bit
and
then
took
a
book
and
sat
up
reading
but
i
be
hanged
if
i
can
remember
what
i
read
nor
even
what
the
book
was
for
every
now
and
then
a
shriek
came
up
that
would
have
made
a
dead
man
turn
in
his
coffin
a
little
before
dawn
some
one
knocked
at
the
front
door
there
was
no
mistaking
that
for
anything
else
and
i
opened
my
window
and
looked
down
for
i
guessed
that
some
one
wanted
the
doctor
supposing
that
the
new
man
had
taken
luke
house
it
was
rather
a
relief
to
hear
a
human
knock
after
that
awful
noise
you
can
not
see
the
door
from
above
owing
to
the
little
porch
the
knocking
came
again
and
i
called
out
asking
who
was
there
but
nobody
answered
though
the
knock
was
repeated
i
sang
out
again
and
said
that
the
doctor
did
not
live
here
any
longer
there
was
no
answer
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
some
old
countryman
who
was
stone
deaf
so
i
took
my
candle
and
went
down
to
open
the
door
upon
my
word
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
thing
yet
and
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
other
noises
i
went
down
convinced
that
i
should
find
somebody
outside
on
the
doorstep
with
a
message
i
set
the
candle
on
the
hall
table
so
that
the
wind
should
not
blow
it
out
when
i
opened
while
i
was
drawing
the
bolt
i
heard
the
knocking
again
it
was
not
loud
and
it
had
a
queer
hollow
sound
now
that
i
was
close
to
it
i
remember
but
i
certainly
thought
it
was
made
by
some
person
who
wanted
to
get
in
it
was
there
was
nobody
there
but
as
i
opened
the
door
inward
standing
a
little
on
one
side
so
as
to
see
out
at
once
something
rolled
across
the
threshold
and
stopped
against
my
foot
i
drew
back
as
i
felt
it
for
i
knew
what
it
was
before
i
looked
down
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
knew
and
it
seemed
unreasonable
for
i
am
still
quite
sure
that
i
had
thrown
it
across
the
road
it
a
french
window
that
opens
wide
and
i
got
a
good
swing
when
i
flung
it
out
besides
when
i
went
out
early
in
the
morning
i
found
the
bandbox
beyond
the
thickset
hedge
you
may
think
it
opened
when
i
threw
it
and
that
the
skull
dropped
out
but
that
impossible
for
nobody
could
throw
an
empty
cardboard
box
so
far
it
out
of
the
question
you
might
as
well
try
to
fling
a
ball
of
paper
yards
or
a
blown
bird
egg
to
go
back
i
shut
and
bolted
the
hall
door
picked
the
thing
up
carefully
and
put
it
on
the
table
beside
the
candle
i
did
that
mechanically
as
one
instinctively
does
the
right
thing
in
danger
without
thinking
at
all
unless
one
does
the
opposite
it
may
seem
odd
but
i
believe
my
first
thought
had
been
that
somebody
might
come
and
find
me
there
on
the
threshold
while
it
was
resting
against
my
foot
lying
a
little
on
its
side
and
turning
one
hollow
eye
up
at
my
face
as
if
it
meant
to
accuse
me
and
the
light
and
shadow
from
the
candle
played
in
the
hollows
of
the
eyes
as
it
stood
on
the
table
so
that
they
seemed
to
open
and
shut
at
me
then
the
candle
went
out
quite
unexpectedly
though
the
door
was
fastened
and
there
was
not
the
least
draught
and
i
used
up
at
least
half
a
dozen
matches
before
it
would
burn
again
i
sat
down
rather
suddenly
without
quite
knowing
why
probably
i
had
been
badly
frightened
and
perhaps
you
will
admit
there
was
no
great
shame
in
being
scared
the
thing
had
come
home
and
it
wanted
to
go
upstairs
back
to
its
cupboard
i
sat
still
and
stared
at
it
for
a
bit
till
i
began
to
feel
very
cold
then
i
took
it
and
carried
it
up
and
set
it
in
its
place
and
i
remember
that
i
spoke
to
it
and
promised
that
it
should
have
its
bandbox
again
in
the
morning
you
want
to
know
whether
i
stayed
in
the
room
till
daybreak
yes
but
i
kept
a
light
burning
and
sat
up
smoking
and
reading
most
likely
out
of
fright
plain
undeniable
fear
and
you
need
not
call
it
cowardice
either
for
that
not
the
same
thing
i
could
not
have
stayed
alone
with
that
thing
in
the
cupboard
i
should
have
been
scared
to
death
though
i
not
more
timid
than
other
people
confound
it
all
man
it
had
crossed
the
road
alone
and
had
got
up
the
doorstep
and
had
knocked
to
be
let
in
when
the
dawn
came
i
put
on
my
boots
and
went
out
to
find
the
bandbox
i
had
to
go
a
good
way
round
by
the
gate
near
the
highroad
and
i
found
the
box
open
and
hanging
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
it
had
caught
on
the
twigs
by
the
string
and
the
lid
had
fallen
off
and
was
lying
on
the
ground
below
it
that
shows
that
it
did
not
open
till
it
was
well
over
and
if
it
had
not
opened
as
soon
as
it
left
my
hand
what
was
inside
it
must
have
gone
beyond
the
road
too
that
all
i
took
the
box
upstairs
to
the
cupboard
and
put
the
skull
back
and
locked
it
up
when
the
girl
brought
me
my
breakfast
she
said
she
was
sorry
but
that
she
must
go
and
she
did
not
care
if
she
lost
her
month
wages
i
looked
at
her
and
her
face
was
a
sort
of
greenish
yellowish
white
i
pretended
to
be
surprised
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
but
that
was
of
no
use
for
she
just
turned
on
me
and
wanted
to
know
whether
i
meant
to
stay
in
a
haunted
house
and
how
long
i
expected
to
live
if
i
did
for
though
she
noticed
i
was
sometimes
a
little
hard
of
hearing
she
did
not
believe
that
even
i
could
sleep
through
those
screams
again
and
if
i
could
why
had
i
been
moving
about
the
house
and
opening
and
shutting
the
front
door
between
three
and
four
in
the
morning
there
was
no
answering
that
since
she
had
heard
me
so
off
she
went
and
i
was
left
to
myself
i
went
down
to
the
village
during
the
morning
and
found
a
woman
who
was
willing
to
come
and
do
the
little
work
there
is
and
cook
my
dinner
on
condition
that
she
might
go
home
every
night
as
for
me
i
moved
downstairs
that
day
and
i
have
never
tried
to
sleep
in
the
best
bedroom
since
after
a
little
while
i
got
a
brace
of
scotch
servants
from
london
and
things
were
quiet
enough
for
a
long
time
i
began
by
telling
them
that
the
house
was
in
a
very
exposed
position
and
that
the
wind
whistled
round
it
a
good
deal
in
the
autumn
and
winter
which
had
given
it
a
bad
name
in
the
village
the
cornish
people
being
inclined
to
superstition
and
telling
ghost
stories
the
two
sisters
almost
smiled
and
they
answered
with
great
contempt
that
they
had
no
great
opinion
of
any
southern
bogey
whatever
having
been
in
service
in
two
english
haunted
houses
where
they
had
never
seen
so
much
as
the
boy
in
gray
whom
they
reckoned
no
very
particular
rarity
in
forfarshire
they
stayed
with
me
several
months
and
while
they
were
in
the
house
we
had
peace
and
quiet
one
of
them
is
here
again
now
but
she
went
away
with
her
sister
within
the
year
this
one
she
was
the
cook
married
the
sexton
who
works
in
my
garden
that
the
way
of
it
it
a
small
village
and
he
has
not
much
to
do
and
he
knows
enough
about
flowers
to
help
me
nicely
besides
doing
most
of
the
hard
work
for
though
i
fond
of
exercise
i
getting
a
little
stiff
in
the
hinges
he
a
sober
silent
sort
of
fellow
who
minds
his
own
business
and
he
was
a
widower
when
i
came
here
trehearn
is
his
name
james
trehearn
the
scotch
sisters
would
not
admit
that
there
was
anything
wrong
about
the
house
but
when
november
came
they
gave
me
warning
that
they
were
going
on
the
ground
that
the
chapel
was
such
a
long
walk
from
here
being
in
the
next
parish
and
that
they
could
not
possibly
go
to
our
church
but
the
younger
one
came
back
in
the
spring
and
as
soon
as
the
banns
could
be
published
she
was
married
to
james
trehearn
by
the
vicar
and
she
seems
to
have
had
no
scruples
about
hearing
him
preach
since
then
i
quite
satisfied
if
she
is
the
couple
live
in
a
small
cottage
that
looks
over
the
churchyard
i
suppose
you
are
wondering
what
all
this
has
to
do
with
what
i
was
talking
about
i
alone
so
much
that
when
an
old
friend
comes
to
see
me
i
sometimes
go
on
talking
just
for
the
sake
of
hearing
my
own
voice
but
in
this
case
there
is
really
a
connection
of
ideas
it
was
james
trehearn
who
buried
poor
pratt
and
her
husband
after
her
in
the
same
grave
and
it
not
far
from
the
back
of
his
cottage
that
the
connection
in
my
mind
you
see
it
plain
enough
he
knows
something
i
quite
sure
that
he
does
by
his
manner
though
he
such
a
reticent
beggar
yes
i
alone
in
the
house
at
night
now
for
trehearn
does
everything
herself
and
when
i
have
a
friend
the
sexton
niece
comes
in
to
wait
on
the
table
he
takes
his
wife
home
every
evening
in
winter
but
in
summer
when
there
light
she
goes
by
herself
she
not
a
nervous
woman
but
she
less
sure
than
she
used
to
be
that
there
are
no
bogies
in
england
worth
a
scotchwoman
notice
is
it
amusing
the
idea
that
scotland
has
a
monopoly
of
the
supernatural
odd
sort
of
national
pride
i
call
that
do
you
that
a
good
fire
is
it
when
driftwood
gets
started
at
last
there
nothing
like
it
i
think
yes
we
get
lots
of
it
for
i
sorry
to
say
there
are
still
a
great
many
wrecks
about
here
it
a
lonely
coast
and
you
may
have
all
the
wood
you
want
for
the
trouble
of
bringing
it
in
trehearn
and
i
borrow
a
cart
now
and
then
and
load
it
between
here
and
the
spit
i
hate
a
coal
fire
when
i
can
get
wood
of
any
sort
a
log
is
company
even
if
it
only
a
piece
of
a
or
timber
sawn
off
and
the
salt
in
it
makes
pretty
sparks
see
how
they
fly
like
japanese
upon
my
word
with
an
old
friend
and
a
good
fire
and
a
pipe
one
forgets
all
about
that
thing
upstairs
especially
now
that
the
wind
has
moderated
it
only
a
lull
though
and
it
will
blow
a
gale
before
morning
you
think
you
would
like
to
see
the
skull
i
no
objection
there
no
reason
why
you
should
have
a
look
at
it
and
you
never
saw
a
more
perfect
one
in
your
life
except
that
there
are
two
front
teeth
missing
in
the
lower
jaw
oh
yes
i
had
not
told
you
about
the
jaw
yet
trehearn
found
it
in
the
garden
last
spring
when
he
was
digging
a
pit
for
a
new
asparagus
bed
you
know
we
make
asparagus
beds
six
or
eight
feet
deep
here
yes
yes
i
had
forgotten
to
tell
you
that
he
was
digging
straight
down
just
as
he
digs
a
grave
if
you
want
a
good
asparagus
bed
made
i
advise
you
to
get
a
sexton
to
make
it
for
you
those
fellows
have
a
wonderful
knack
at
that
sort
of
digging
trehearn
had
got
down
about
three
feet
when
he
cut
into
a
mass
of
white
lime
in
the
side
of
the
trench
he
had
noticed
that
the
earth
was
a
little
looser
there
though
he
says
it
had
not
been
disturbed
for
a
number
of
years
i
suppose
he
thought
that
even
old
lime
might
not
be
good
for
asparagus
so
he
broke
it
out
and
threw
it
up
it
was
pretty
hard
he
says
in
biggish
lumps
and
out
of
sheer
force
of
habit
he
cracked
the
lumps
with
his
spade
as
they
lay
outside
the
pit
beside
him
the
jawbone
of
a
skull
dropped
out
of
one
of
the
pieces
he
thinks
he
must
have
knocked
out
the
two
front
teeth
in
breaking
up
the
lime
but
he
did
not
see
them
anywhere
he
a
very
experienced
man
in
such
things
as
you
may
imagine
and
he
said
at
once
that
the
jaw
had
probably
belonged
to
a
young
woman
and
that
the
teeth
had
been
complete
when
she
died
he
brought
it
to
me
and
asked
me
if
i
wanted
to
keep
it
if
i
did
not
he
said
he
would
drop
it
into
the
next
grave
he
made
in
the
churchyard
as
he
supposed
it
was
a
christian
jaw
and
ought
to
have
decent
burial
wherever
the
rest
of
the
body
might
be
i
told
him
that
doctors
often
put
bones
into
quicklime
to
whiten
them
nicely
and
that
i
supposed
pratt
had
once
had
a
little
lime
pit
in
the
garden
for
that
purpose
and
had
forgotten
the
jaw
trehearn
looked
at
me
quietly
maybe
it
fitted
that
skull
that
used
to
be
in
the
cupboard
upstairs
sir
he
said
maybe
pratt
had
put
the
skull
into
the
lime
to
clean
it
or
something
and
when
he
took
it
out
he
left
the
lower
jaw
behind
there
some
human
hair
sticking
in
the
lime
sir
i
saw
there
was
and
that
was
what
trehearn
said
if
he
did
not
suspect
something
why
in
the
world
should
he
have
suggested
that
the
jaw
might
fit
the
skull
besides
it
did
that
proof
that
he
knows
more
than
he
cares
to
tell
do
you
suppose
he
looked
before
she
was
buried
or
perhaps
when
he
buried
luke
in
the
same
grave
well
well
it
of
no
use
to
go
over
that
is
it
i
said
i
would
keep
the
jaw
with
the
skull
and
i
took
it
upstairs
and
fitted
it
into
its
place
there
not
the
slightest
doubt
about
the
two
belonging
together
and
together
they
are
trehearn
knows
several
things
we
were
talking
about
plastering
the
kitchen
a
while
ago
and
he
happened
to
remember
that
it
had
not
been
done
since
the
very
week
when
pratt
died
he
did
not
say
that
the
mason
must
have
left
some
lime
on
the
place
but
he
thought
it
and
that
it
was
the
very
same
lime
he
had
found
in
the
asparagus
pit
he
knows
a
lot
trehearn
is
one
of
your
silent
beggars
who
can
put
two
and
two
together
that
grave
is
very
near
the
back
of
his
cottage
too
and
he
one
of
the
quickest
men
with
a
spade
i
ever
saw
if
he
wanted
to
know
the
truth
he
could
and
no
one
else
would
ever
be
the
wiser
unless
he
chose
to
tell
in
a
quiet
village
like
ours
people
do
go
and
spend
the
night
in
the
churchyard
to
see
whether
the
sexton
potters
about
by
himself
between
ten
and
daylight
what
is
awful
to
think
of
is
luke
deliberation
if
he
did
it
his
cool
certainty
that
no
one
would
find
him
out
above
all
his
nerve
for
that
must
have
been
extraordinary
i
sometimes
think
it
bad
enough
to
live
in
the
place
where
it
was
done
if
it
really
was
done
i
always
put
in
the
condition
you
see
for
the
sake
of
his
memory
and
a
little
bit
for
my
own
sake
too
i
go
upstairs
and
fetch
the
box
in
a
minute
let
me
light
my
pipe
there
no
hurry
we
had
supper
early
and
it
only
nine
i
never
let
a
friend
go
to
bed
before
twelve
or
with
less
than
three
glasses
you
may
have
as
many
more
as
you
like
but
you
have
less
for
the
sake
of
old
times
it
breezing
up
again
do
you
hear
that
was
only
a
lull
just
now
and
we
are
going
to
have
a
bad
night
a
thing
happened
that
made
me
start
a
little
when
i
found
that
the
jaw
fitted
exactly
i
not
very
easily
startled
in
that
way
myself
but
i
have
seen
people
make
a
quick
movement
drawing
their
breath
sharply
when
they
had
thought
they
were
alone
and
suddenly
turned
and
saw
some
one
very
near
them
nobody
can
call
that
fear
you
would
would
you
no
well
just
when
i
had
set
the
jaw
in
its
place
under
the
skull
the
teeth
closed
sharply
on
my
finger
it
felt
exactly
as
if
it
were
biting
me
hard
and
i
confess
that
i
jumped
before
i
realised
that
i
had
been
pressing
the
jaw
and
the
skull
together
with
my
other
hand
i
assure
you
i
was
not
at
all
nervous
it
was
broad
daylight
too
and
a
fine
day
and
the
sun
was
streaming
into
the
best
bedroom
it
would
have
been
absurd
to
be
nervous
and
it
was
only
a
quick
mistaken
impression
but
it
really
made
me
feel
queer
somehow
it
made
me
think
of
the
funny
verdict
of
the
coroner
jury
on
luke
death
by
the
hand
or
teeth
of
some
person
or
animal
unknown
ever
since
that
i
wished
i
had
seen
those
marks
on
his
throat
though
the
lower
jaw
was
missing
then
i
have
often
seen
a
man
do
insane
things
with
his
hands
that
he
does
not
realise
at
all
i
once
saw
a
man
hanging
on
by
an
old
awning
stop
with
one
hand
leaning
backward
outboard
with
all
his
weight
on
it
and
he
was
just
cutting
the
stop
with
the
knife
in
his
other
hand
when
i
got
my
arms
round
him
we
were
in
going
twenty
knots
he
had
not
the
smallest
idea
what
he
was
doing
neither
had
i
when
i
managed
to
pinch
my
finger
between
the
teeth
of
that
thing
i
can
feel
it
now
it
was
exactly
as
if
it
were
alive
and
were
trying
to
bite
me
it
would
if
it
could
for
i
know
it
hates
me
poor
thing
do
you
suppose
that
what
rattles
about
inside
is
really
a
bit
of
lead
well
i
get
the
box
down
presently
and
if
whatever
it
is
happens
to
drop
out
into
your
hands
that
your
affair
if
it
only
a
clod
of
earth
or
a
pebble
the
whole
matter
would
be
off
my
mind
and
i
do
believe
i
should
ever
think
of
the
skull
again
but
somehow
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
shake
out
the
bit
of
hard
stuff
myself
the
mere
idea
that
it
may
be
lead
makes
me
confoundedly
uncomfortable
yet
i
got
the
conviction
that
i
shall
know
before
long
i
shall
certainly
know
i
sure
trehearn
knows
but
he
such
a
silent
beggar
i
go
upstairs
now
and
get
it
what
you
had
better
go
with
me
ha
ha
do
you
think
i
afraid
of
a
bandbox
and
a
noise
nonsense
bother
the
candle
it
wo
light
as
if
the
ridiculous
thing
understood
what
it
wanted
for
look
at
that
the
third
match
they
light
fast
enough
for
my
pipe
there
do
you
see
it
a
fresh
box
just
out
of
the
tin
safe
where
i
keep
the
supply
on
account
of
the
dampness
oh
you
think
the
wick
of
the
candle
may
be
damp
do
you
all
right
i
light
the
beastly
thing
in
the
fire
that
wo
go
out
at
all
events
yes
it
sputters
a
bit
but
it
will
keep
lighted
now
it
burns
just
like
any
other
candle
does
it
the
fact
is
candles
are
not
very
good
about
here
i
do
know
where
they
come
from
but
they
have
a
way
of
burning
low
occasionally
with
a
greenish
flame
that
spits
tiny
sparks
and
i
often
annoyed
by
their
going
out
of
themselves
it
can
not
be
helped
for
it
will
be
long
before
we
have
electricity
in
our
village
it
really
is
rather
a
poor
light
is
it
you
think
i
had
better
leave
you
the
candle
and
take
the
lamp
do
you
i
do
like
to
carry
lamps
about
that
the
truth
i
never
dropped
one
in
my
life
but
i
have
always
thought
i
might
and
it
so
confoundedly
dangerous
if
you
do
besides
i
am
pretty
well
used
to
these
rotten
candles
by
this
time
you
may
as
well
finish
that
glass
while
i
getting
it
for
i
do
mean
to
let
you
off
with
less
than
three
before
you
go
to
bed
you
have
to
go
upstairs
either
for
i
put
you
in
the
old
study
next
to
the
surgery
that
where
i
live
myself
the
fact
is
i
never
ask
a
friend
to
sleep
upstairs
now
the
last
man
who
did
was
crackenthorpe
and
he
said
he
was
kept
awake
all
night
you
remember
old
crack
you
he
stuck
to
the
service
and
they
just
made
him
an
admiral
yes
i
off
now
unless
the
candle
goes
out
i
could
help
asking
if
you
remembered
crackenthorpe
if
any
one
had
told
us
that
the
skinny
little
idiot
he
used
to
be
was
to
turn
out
the
most
successful
of
the
lot
of
us
we
should
have
laughed
at
the
idea
should
we
you
and
i
did
not
do
badly
it
true
but
i
really
going
now
i
do
mean
to
let
you
think
that
i
been
putting
it
off
by
talking
as
if
there
were
anything
to
be
afraid
of
if
i
were
scared
i
should
tell
you
so
quite
frankly
and
get
you
to
go
upstairs
with
me
here
the
box
i
brought
it
down
very
carefully
so
as
not
to
disturb
it
poor
thing
you
see
if
it
were
shaken
the
jaw
might
get
separated
from
it
again
and
i
sure
it
would
like
that
yes
the
candle
went
out
as
i
was
coming
downstairs
but
that
was
the
draught
from
the
leaky
window
on
the
landing
did
you
hear
anything
yes
there
was
another
scream
am
i
pale
do
you
say
that
nothing
my
heart
is
a
little
queer
sometimes
and
i
went
upstairs
too
fast
in
fact
that
one
reason
why
i
really
prefer
to
live
altogether
on
the
ground
floor
wherever
that
shriek
came
from
it
was
not
from
the
skull
for
i
had
the
box
in
my
hand
when
i
heard
the
noise
and
here
it
is
now
so
we
have
proved
definitely
that
the
screams
are
produced
by
something
else
no
doubt
i
shall
find
out
some
day
what
makes
them
some
crevice
in
the
wall
of
course
or
a
crack
in
a
chimney
or
a
chink
in
the
frame
of
a
window
that
the
way
all
ghost
stories
end
in
real
life
do
you
know
i
jolly
glad
i
thought
of
going
up
and
bringing
it
down
for
you
to
see
for
that
last
shriek
settles
the
question
to
think
that
i
should
have
been
so
weak
as
to
fancy
that
the
poor
skull
could
really
cry
out
like
a
living
thing
now
i
open
the
box
and
we
take
it
out
and
look
at
it
under
the
bright
light
it
rather
awful
to
think
that
the
poor
lady
used
to
sit
there
in
your
chair
evening
after
evening
in
just
the
same
light
is
it
but
then
i
made
up
my
mind
that
it
all
rubbish
from
beginning
to
end
and
that
it
just
an
old
skull
that
luke
had
when
he
was
a
student
and
perhaps
he
put
it
into
the
lime
merely
to
whiten
it
and
could
not
find
the
jaw
i
made
a
seal
on
the
string
you
see
after
i
had
put
the
jaw
in
its
place
and
i
wrote
on
the
cover
there
the
old
white
label
on
it
still
from
the
milliner
addressed
to
pratt
when
the
hat
was
sent
to
her
and
as
there
was
room
i
wrote
on
the
edge
a
skull
once
the
property
of
the
late
luke
pratt
i
do
quite
know
why
i
wrote
that
unless
it
was
with
the
idea
of
explaining
how
the
thing
happened
to
be
in
my
possession
i
can
not
help
wondering
sometimes
what
sort
of
hat
it
was
that
came
in
the
bandbox
what
colour
was
it
do
you
think
was
it
a
gay
spring
hat
with
a
bobbing
feather
and
pretty
ribands
strange
that
the
very
same
box
should
hold
the
head
that
wore
the
finery
perhaps
no
we
made
up
our
minds
that
it
just
came
from
the
hospital
in
london
where
luke
did
his
time
it
far
better
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
is
it
there
no
more
connection
between
that
skull
and
poor
pratt
than
there
was
between
my
story
about
the
lead
and
good
lord
take
the
lamp
do
let
it
go
out
if
you
can
help
it
have
the
window
fastened
again
in
a
second
i
say
what
a
gale
there
it
out
i
told
you
so
never
mind
there
the
firelight
i
got
the
window
shut
the
bolt
was
only
half
down
was
the
box
blown
off
the
table
where
the
deuce
is
it
there
that
wo
open
again
for
i
put
up
the
bar
good
dodge
an
bar
there
nothing
like
it
now
you
find
the
bandbox
while
i
light
the
lamp
confound
those
wretched
matches
yes
a
pipe
spill
is
better
it
must
light
in
the
fire
i
had
thought
of
it
thank
you
there
we
are
again
now
where
the
box
yes
put
it
back
on
the
table
and
we
open
it
that
the
first
time
i
have
ever
known
the
wind
to
burst
that
window
open
but
it
was
partly
carelessness
on
my
part
when
i
last
shut
it
yes
of
course
i
heard
the
scream
it
seemed
to
go
all
round
the
house
before
it
broke
in
at
the
window
that
proves
that
it
always
been
the
wind
and
nothing
else
does
it
when
it
was
not
the
wind
it
was
my
imagination
i
always
been
a
very
imaginative
man
i
must
have
been
though
i
did
not
know
it
as
we
grow
older
we
understand
ourselves
better
do
you
know
i
have
a
drop
of
the
hulstkamp
neat
by
way
of
an
exception
since
you
are
filling
up
your
glass
that
damp
gust
chilled
me
and
with
my
rheumatic
tendency
i
very
much
afraid
of
a
chill
for
the
cold
sometimes
seems
to
stick
in
my
joints
all
winter
when
it
once
gets
in
by
george
that
good
stuff
i
just
light
a
fresh
pipe
now
that
everything
is
snug
again
and
then
we
open
the
box
i
so
glad
we
heard
that
last
scream
together
with
the
skull
here
on
the
table
between
us
for
a
thing
can
not
possibly
be
in
two
places
at
the
same
time
and
the
noise
most
certainly
came
from
outside
as
any
noise
the
wind
makes
must
you
thought
you
heard
it
scream
through
the
room
after
the
window
was
burst
open
oh
yes
so
did
i
but
that
was
natural
enough
when
everything
was
open
of
course
we
heard
the
wind
what
could
one
expect
look
here
please
i
want
you
to
see
that
the
seal
is
intact
before
we
open
the
box
together
will
you
take
my
glasses
no
you
have
your
own
all
right
the
seal
is
sound
you
see
and
you
can
read
the
words
of
the
motto
easily
sweet
and
low
that
it
because
the
poem
goes
on
wind
of
the
western
sea
and
says
blow
him
again
to
me
and
all
that
here
is
the
seal
on
my
where
it
hung
for
more
than
forty
years
my
poor
little
wife
gave
it
to
me
when
i
was
courting
and
i
never
had
any
other
it
was
just
like
her
to
think
of
those
words
she
was
always
fond
of
tennyson
it
of
no
use
to
cut
the
string
for
it
fastened
to
the
box
so
just
break
the
wax
and
untie
the
knot
and
afterward
we
seal
it
up
again
you
see
i
like
to
feel
that
the
thing
is
safe
in
its
place
and
that
nobody
can
take
it
out
not
that
i
should
suspect
trehearn
of
meddling
with
it
but
i
always
feel
that
he
knows
a
lot
more
than
he
tells
you
see
i
managed
it
without
breaking
the
string
though
when
i
fastened
it
i
never
expected
to
open
the
bandbox
again
the
lid
comes
off
easily
enough
there
now
look
what
nothing
in
it
empty
it
gone
man
the
skull
is
gone
no
there
nothing
the
matter
with
me
i
only
trying
to
collect
my
thoughts
it
so
strange
i
positively
certain
that
it
was
inside
when
i
put
on
the
seal
last
spring
i
ca
have
imagined
that
utterly
impossible
if
i
ever
took
a
stiff
glass
with
a
friend
now
and
then
i
would
admit
that
i
might
have
made
some
idiotic
mistake
when
i
had
taken
too
much
but
i
do
and
i
never
did
a
pint
of
ale
at
supper
and
half
a
go
of
rum
at
bedtime
was
the
most
i
ever
took
in
my
good
days
i
believe
it
always
we
sober
fellows
who
get
rheumatism
and
gout
yet
there
was
my
seal
and
there
is
the
empty
bandbox
plain
enough
i
say
i
do
half
like
this
it
not
right
there
something
wrong
about
it
in
my
opinion
you
need
talk
to
me
about
supernatural
manifestations
for
i
do
believe
in
them
not
a
little
bit
somebody
must
have
tampered
with
the
seal
and
stolen
the
skull
sometimes
when
i
go
out
to
work
in
the
garden
in
summer
i
leave
my
watch
and
chain
on
the
table
trehearn
must
have
taken
the
seal
then
and
used
it
for
he
would
be
quite
sure
that
i
should
not
come
in
for
at
least
an
hour
if
it
was
not
trehearn
oh
do
talk
to
me
about
the
possibility
that
the
thing
has
got
out
by
itself
if
it
has
it
must
be
somewhere
about
the
house
in
some
corner
waiting
we
may
come
upon
it
anywhere
waiting
for
us
do
you
know
just
waiting
in
the
dark
then
it
will
scream
at
me
it
will
shriek
at
me
in
the
dark
for
it
hates
me
i
tell
you
the
bandbox
is
quite
empty
we
are
not
dreaming
either
of
us
there
i
turn
it
upside
down
what
that
something
fell
out
as
i
turned
it
over
it
on
the
floor
it
near
your
feet
i
know
it
is
and
we
must
find
it
help
me
to
find
it
man
have
you
got
it
for
god
sake
give
it
to
me
quickly
lead
i
knew
it
when
i
heard
it
fall
i
knew
it
could
be
anything
else
by
the
little
thud
it
made
on
the
so
it
was
lead
after
all
and
luke
did
it
i
feel
a
little
bit
shaken
up
not
exactly
nervous
you
know
but
badly
shaken
up
that
the
fact
anybody
would
i
should
think
after
all
you
can
not
say
that
it
fear
of
the
thing
for
i
went
up
and
brought
it
down
at
least
i
believed
i
was
bringing
it
down
and
that
the
same
thing
and
by
george
rather
than
give
in
to
such
silly
nonsense
take
the
box
upstairs
again
and
put
it
back
in
its
place
it
not
that
it
the
certainty
that
the
poor
little
woman
came
to
her
end
in
that
way
by
my
fault
because
i
told
the
story
that
what
is
so
dreadful
somehow
i
had
always
hoped
that
i
should
never
be
quite
sure
of
it
but
there
is
no
doubting
it
now
look
at
that
look
at
it
that
little
lump
of
lead
with
no
particular
shape
think
of
what
it
did
man
does
it
make
you
shiver
he
gave
her
something
to
make
her
sleep
of
course
but
there
must
have
been
one
moment
of
awful
agony
think
of
having
boiling
lead
poured
into
your
brain
think
of
it
she
was
dead
before
she
could
scream
but
only
think
of
oh
there
it
is
again
it
just
outside
i
know
it
just
outside
i
ca
keep
it
out
of
my
head
oh
oh
you
thought
i
had
fainted
no
i
wish
i
had
for
it
would
have
stopped
sooner
it
all
very
well
to
say
that
it
only
a
noise
and
that
a
noise
never
hurt
anybody
you
as
white
as
a
shroud
yourself
only
one
thing
to
be
done
if
we
hope
to
close
an
eye
we
must
find
it
and
put
it
back
into
its
bandbox
and
shut
it
up
in
the
cupboard
where
it
likes
to
be
i
do
know
how
it
got
out
but
it
wants
to
get
in
again
that
why
it
screams
so
awfully
it
was
never
so
bad
as
this
never
since
i
first
bury
it
yes
if
we
can
find
it
we
bury
it
if
it
takes
us
all
night
we
bury
it
six
feet
deep
and
ram
down
the
earth
over
it
so
that
it
shall
never
get
out
again
and
if
it
screams
we
shall
hardly
hear
it
so
deep
down
quick
we
get
the
lantern
and
look
for
it
it
can
not
be
far
away
i
sure
it
just
outside
it
was
coming
in
when
i
shut
the
window
i
know
it
yes
you
quite
right
i
losing
my
senses
and
i
must
get
hold
of
myself
do
speak
to
me
for
a
minute
or
two
i
sit
quite
still
and
keep
my
eyes
shut
and
repeat
something
i
know
that
the
best
way
add
together
the
altitude
the
latitude
and
the
polar
distance
divide
by
two
and
subtract
the
altitude
from
the
then
add
the
logarithm
of
the
secant
of
the
latitude
the
cosecant
of
the
polar
distance
the
cosine
of
the
and
the
sine
of
the
minus
the
altitude
there
do
say
that
i
out
of
my
senses
for
my
memory
is
all
right
is
it
of
course
you
may
say
that
it
mechanical
and
that
we
never
forget
the
things
we
learned
when
we
were
boys
and
have
used
almost
every
day
for
a
lifetime
but
that
the
very
point
when
a
man
is
going
crazy
it
the
mechanical
part
of
his
mind
that
gets
out
of
order
and
work
right
he
remembers
things
that
never
happened
or
he
sees
things
that
are
real
or
he
hears
noises
when
there
is
perfect
silence
that
not
what
is
the
matter
with
either
of
us
is
it
come
we
get
the
lantern
and
go
round
the
house
it
not
raining
only
blowing
like
old
boots
as
we
used
to
say
the
lantern
is
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
in
the
hall
and
i
always
keep
it
trimmed
in
case
of
a
wreck
no
use
to
look
for
the
thing
i
do
see
how
you
can
say
that
it
was
nonsense
to
talk
of
burying
it
of
course
for
it
does
want
to
be
buried
it
wants
to
go
back
into
its
bandbox
and
be
taken
upstairs
poor
thing
trehearn
took
it
out
i
know
and
made
the
seal
over
again
perhaps
he
took
it
to
the
churchyard
and
he
may
have
meant
well
i
daresay
he
thought
that
it
would
not
scream
any
more
if
it
were
quietly
laid
in
consecrated
ground
near
where
it
belongs
but
it
has
come
home
yes
that
it
he
not
half
a
bad
fellow
trehearn
and
rather
religiously
inclined
i
think
does
not
that
sound
natural
and
reasonable
and
well
meant
he
supposed
it
screamed
because
it
was
not
decently
buried
with
the
rest
but
he
was
wrong
how
should
he
know
that
it
screams
at
me
because
it
hates
me
and
because
it
my
fault
that
there
was
that
little
lump
of
lead
in
it
no
use
to
look
for
it
anyhow
nonsense
i
tell
you
it
wants
to
be
found
hark
what
that
knocking
do
you
hear
it
knock
knock
knock
three
times
then
a
pause
and
then
again
it
has
a
hollow
sound
has
it
it
has
come
home
i
heard
that
knock
before
it
wants
to
come
in
and
be
taken
upstairs
in
its
box
it
at
the
front
door
will
you
come
with
me
we
take
it
in
yes
i
own
that
i
do
like
to
go
alone
and
open
the
door
the
thing
will
roll
in
and
stop
against
my
foot
just
as
it
did
before
and
the
light
will
go
out
i
a
good
deal
shaken
by
finding
that
bit
of
lead
and
besides
my
heart
is
quite
right
too
much
strong
tobacco
perhaps
besides
i
quite
willing
to
own
that
i
a
bit
nervous
if
i
never
was
before
in
my
life
that
right
come
along
i
take
the
box
with
me
so
as
not
to
come
back
do
you
hear
the
knocking
it
not
like
any
other
knocking
i
ever
heard
if
you
will
hold
this
door
open
i
can
find
the
lantern
under
the
stairs
by
the
light
from
this
room
without
bringing
the
lamp
into
the
hall
it
would
only
go
out
the
thing
knows
we
are
coming
hark
it
impatient
to
get
in
shut
the
door
till
the
lantern
is
ready
whatever
you
do
there
will
be
the
usual
trouble
with
the
matches
i
suppose
no
the
first
one
by
jove
i
tell
you
it
wants
to
get
in
so
there
no
trouble
all
right
with
that
door
now
shut
it
please
now
come
and
hold
the
lantern
for
it
blowing
so
hard
outside
that
i
shall
have
to
use
both
hands
it
hold
the
light
low
do
you
hear
the
knocking
still
here
goes
open
just
enough
with
my
foot
against
the
bottom
of
the
door
now
catch
it
it
only
the
wind
that
blows
it
across
the
floor
all
there
half
a
hurricane
outside
i
tell
you
have
you
got
it
the
bandbox
is
on
the
table
one
minute
and
i
have
the
bar
up
there
why
did
you
throw
it
into
the
box
so
roughly
it
does
like
that
you
know
what
do
you
say
bitten
your
hand
nonsense
man
you
did
just
what
i
did
you
pressed
the
jaws
together
with
your
other
hand
and
pinched
yourself
let
me
see
you
do
mean
to
say
you
have
drawn
blood
you
must
have
squeezed
hard
by
jove
for
the
skin
is
certainly
torn
give
you
some
carbolic
solution
for
it
before
we
go
to
bed
for
they
say
a
scratch
from
a
skull
tooth
may
go
bad
and
give
trouble
come
inside
again
and
let
me
see
it
by
the
lamp
i
bring
the
bandbox
never
mind
the
lantern
it
may
just
as
well
burn
in
the
hall
for
i
shall
need
it
presently
when
i
go
up
the
stairs
yes
shut
the
door
if
you
will
it
makes
it
more
cheerful
and
bright
is
your
finger
still
bleeding
i
get
you
the
carbolic
in
an
instant
just
let
me
see
the
thing
ugh
there
a
drop
of
blood
on
the
upper
jaw
it
on
the
ghastly
is
it
when
i
saw
it
running
along
the
floor
of
the
hall
the
strength
almost
went
out
of
my
hands
and
i
felt
my
knees
bending
then
i
understood
that
it
was
the
gale
driving
it
over
the
smooth
boards
you
do
blame
me
no
i
should
think
not
we
were
boys
together
and
we
seen
a
thing
or
two
and
we
may
just
as
well
own
to
each
other
that
we
were
both
in
a
beastly
funk
when
it
slid
across
the
floor
at
you
no
wonder
you
pinched
your
finger
picking
it
up
after
that
if
i
did
the
same
thing
out
of
sheer
nervousness
in
broad
daylight
with
the
sun
streaming
in
on
me
strange
that
the
jaw
should
stick
to
it
so
closely
is
it
i
suppose
it
the
dampness
for
it
shuts
like
a
vice
i
have
wiped
off
the
drop
of
blood
for
it
was
not
nice
to
look
at
i
not
going
to
try
to
open
the
jaws
do
be
afraid
i
shall
not
play
any
tricks
with
the
poor
thing
but
i
just
seal
the
box
again
and
we
take
it
upstairs
and
put
it
away
where
it
wants
to
be
the
wax
is
on
the
by
the
window
thank
you
it
will
be
long
before
i
leave
my
seal
lying
about
again
for
trehearn
to
use
i
can
tell
you
explain
i
do
explain
natural
phenomena
but
if
you
choose
to
think
that
trehearn
had
hidden
it
somewhere
in
the
bushes
and
that
the
gale
blew
it
to
the
house
against
the
door
and
made
it
knock
as
if
it
wanted
to
be
let
in
you
not
thinking
the
impossible
and
i
quite
ready
to
agree
with
you
do
you
see
that
you
can
swear
that
you
actually
seen
me
seal
it
this
time
in
case
anything
of
the
kind
should
occur
again
the
wax
fastens
the
strings
to
the
lid
which
can
not
possibly
be
lifted
even
enough
to
get
in
one
finger
you
quite
satisfied
are
you
yes
besides
i
shall
lock
the
cupboard
and
keep
the
key
in
my
pocket
hereafter
now
we
can
take
the
lantern
and
go
upstairs
do
you
know
i
very
much
inclined
to
agree
with
your
theory
that
the
wind
blew
it
against
the
house
i
go
ahead
for
i
know
the
stairs
just
hold
the
lantern
near
my
feet
as
we
go
up
how
the
wind
howls
and
whistles
did
you
feel
the
sand
on
the
floor
under
your
shoes
as
we
crossed
the
hall
yes
this
is
the
door
of
the
best
bedroom
hold
up
the
lantern
please
this
side
by
the
head
of
the
bed
i
left
the
cupboard
open
when
i
got
the
box
is
it
queer
how
the
faint
odour
of
women
dresses
will
hang
about
an
old
closet
for
years
this
is
the
shelf
you
seen
me
set
the
box
there
and
now
you
see
me
turn
the
key
and
put
it
into
my
pocket
so
that
done
are
you
sure
you
quite
comfortable
it
not
much
of
a
room
but
i
daresay
you
would
as
soon
sleep
here
as
upstairs
if
you
want
anything
sing
out
there
only
a
lath
and
plaster
partition
between
us
there
not
so
much
wind
on
this
side
by
half
there
the
hollands
on
the
table
if
you
have
one
more
nightcap
no
well
do
as
you
please
again
and
do
dream
about
that
thing
if
you
can
the
following
paragraph
appeared
in
the
november
mysterious
death
of
a
retired
sea
captain
the
village
of
tredcombe
is
much
disturbed
by
the
strange
death
of
captain
charles
braddock
and
all
sorts
of
impossible
stories
are
circulating
with
regard
to
the
circumstances
which
certainly
seem
difficult
of
explanation
the
retired
captain
who
had
successfully
commanded
in
his
time
the
largest
and
fastest
liners
belonging
to
one
of
the
principal
transatlantic
steamship
companies
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
on
tuesday
morning
in
his
own
cottage
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
village
an
examination
was
made
at
once
by
the
local
practitioner
which
revealed
the
horrible
fact
that
the
deceased
had
been
bitten
in
the
throat
by
a
human
assailant
with
such
amazing
force
as
to
crush
the
windpipe
and
cause
death
the
marks
of
the
teeth
of
both
jaws
were
so
plainly
visible
on
the
skin
that
they
could
be
counted
but
the
perpetrator
of
the
deed
had
evidently
lost
the
two
lower
middle
incisors
it
is
hoped
that
this
peculiarity
may
help
to
identify
the
murderer
who
can
only
be
a
dangerous
escaped
maniac
the
deceased
though
over
years
of
age
is
said
to
have
been
a
hale
man
of
considerable
physical
strength
and
it
is
remarkable
that
no
signs
of
any
struggle
were
visible
in
the
room
nor
could
it
be
ascertained
how
the
murderer
had
entered
the
house
warning
has
been
sent
to
all
the
insane
asylums
in
the
united
kingdom
but
as
yet
no
information
has
been
received
regarding
the
escape
of
any
dangerous
patient
the
coroner
jury
returned
the
somewhat
singular
verdict
that
captain
braddock
came
to
his
death
the
hands
or
teeth
of
some
person
unknown
the
local
surgeon
is
said
to
have
expressed
privately
the
opinion
that
the
maniac
is
a
woman
a
view
he
deduces
from
the
small
size
of
the
jaws
as
shown
by
the
marks
of
the
teeth
the
whole
affair
is
shrouded
in
mystery
captain
braddock
was
a
widower
and
lived
alone
he
leaves
no
children
students
of
ghost
lore
and
haunted
houses
will
find
the
foundation
of
the
foregoing
story
in
the
legends
about
a
skull
which
is
still
preserved
in
the
called
bettiscombe
manor
situated
i
believe
on
the
dorsetshire
coast
man
overboard
yes
i
have
heard
man
overboard
a
good
many
times
since
i
was
a
boy
and
once
or
twice
i
have
seen
the
man
go
there
are
more
men
lost
in
that
way
than
passengers
on
ocean
steamers
ever
learn
of
i
have
stood
looking
over
the
rail
on
a
dark
night
when
there
was
a
step
beside
me
and
something
flew
past
my
head
like
a
big
black
bat
and
then
there
was
a
splash
stokers
often
go
like
that
they
go
mad
with
the
heat
and
they
slip
up
on
deck
and
are
gone
before
anybody
can
stop
them
often
without
being
seen
or
heard
now
and
then
a
passenger
will
do
it
but
he
generally
has
what
he
thinks
a
pretty
good
reason
i
have
seen
a
man
empty
his
revolver
into
a
crowd
of
emigrants
forward
and
then
go
over
like
a
rocket
of
course
any
officer
who
respects
himself
will
do
what
he
can
to
pick
a
man
up
if
the
weather
is
not
so
heavy
that
he
would
have
to
risk
his
ship
but
i
do
think
i
remember
seeing
a
man
come
back
when
he
was
once
fairly
gone
more
than
two
or
three
times
in
all
my
life
though
we
have
often
picked
up
the
and
sometimes
the
fellow
cap
stokers
and
passengers
jump
over
i
never
knew
a
sailor
to
do
that
drunk
or
sober
yes
they
say
it
has
happened
on
hard
ships
but
i
never
knew
a
case
myself
once
in
a
long
time
a
man
is
fished
out
when
it
is
just
too
late
and
dies
in
the
boat
before
you
can
get
him
aboard
and
well
i
do
know
that
i
ever
told
that
story
since
it
happened
i
knew
a
fellow
who
went
over
and
came
back
dead
i
see
him
after
he
came
back
only
one
of
us
did
but
we
all
knew
he
was
there
no
i
am
not
giving
you
sharks
there
is
a
shark
in
this
story
and
i
do
know
that
i
would
tell
it
at
all
if
we
were
alone
just
you
and
i
but
you
and
i
have
seen
things
in
various
parts
and
maybe
you
will
understand
anyhow
you
know
that
i
am
telling
what
i
know
about
and
nothing
else
and
it
has
been
on
my
mind
to
tell
you
ever
since
it
happened
only
there
has
been
a
chance
it
a
long
story
and
it
took
some
time
to
happen
and
it
began
a
good
many
years
ago
in
october
as
well
as
i
can
remember
i
was
mate
then
i
passed
the
local
marine
board
for
master
about
three
years
later
she
was
the
of
new
york
with
lumber
for
the
west
indies
schooner
captain
hackstaff
she
was
an
one
even
then
no
steam
donkey
and
all
to
do
by
hand
there
were
still
sailors
in
the
coasting
trade
in
those
days
you
remember
she
was
a
hard
ship
for
the
old
man
was
better
than
most
of
them
though
he
kept
to
himself
and
had
a
face
like
a
we
were
thirteen
all
told
in
the
ship
company
and
some
of
them
afterwards
thought
that
might
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
but
i
had
all
that
nonsense
knocked
out
of
me
when
i
was
a
boy
i
do
mean
to
say
that
i
like
to
go
to
sea
on
a
friday
but
i
gone
to
sea
on
a
friday
and
nothing
has
happened
and
twice
before
that
we
have
been
thirteen
because
one
of
the
hands
did
turn
up
at
the
last
minute
and
nothing
ever
happened
either
nothing
worse
than
the
loss
of
a
light
spar
or
two
or
a
little
canvas
whenever
i
have
been
wrecked
we
had
sailed
as
cheerily
as
you
please
no
thirteens
no
fridays
no
dead
men
in
the
hold
i
believe
it
generally
happens
that
way
i
daresay
you
remember
those
two
benton
boys
that
were
so
much
alike
it
is
no
wonder
for
they
were
twin
brothers
they
shipped
with
us
as
boys
on
the
old
when
you
were
mate
and
i
was
before
the
mast
i
never
was
quite
sure
which
was
which
of
those
two
even
then
and
when
they
both
had
beards
it
was
harder
than
ever
to
tell
them
apart
one
was
jim
and
the
other
was
jack
james
benton
and
john
benton
the
only
difference
i
ever
could
see
was
that
one
seemed
to
be
rather
more
cheerful
and
inclined
to
talk
than
the
other
but
one
could
even
be
sure
of
that
perhaps
they
had
moods
anyhow
there
was
one
of
them
that
used
to
whistle
when
he
was
alone
he
only
knew
one
tune
and
that
was
nancy
lee
and
the
other
did
know
any
tune
at
all
but
i
may
be
mistaken
about
that
too
perhaps
they
both
knew
it
well
those
two
benton
boys
turned
up
on
board
the
they
had
been
on
half
a
dozen
ships
since
the
and
they
had
grown
up
and
were
good
seamen
they
had
reddish
beards
and
bright
blue
eyes
and
freckled
faces
and
they
were
quiet
fellows
good
workmen
on
rigging
pretty
willing
and
both
good
men
at
the
wheel
they
managed
to
be
in
the
same
watch
it
was
the
port
watch
on
the
and
that
was
mine
and
i
had
great
confidence
in
them
both
if
there
was
any
job
aloft
that
needed
two
hands
they
were
always
the
first
to
jump
into
the
rigging
but
that
does
often
happen
on
a
schooner
if
it
breezed
up
and
the
jibtopsail
was
to
be
taken
in
they
never
minded
a
wetting
and
they
would
be
out
at
the
bowsprit
end
before
there
was
a
hand
at
the
downhaul
the
men
liked
them
for
that
and
because
they
did
blow
about
what
they
could
do
i
remember
one
day
in
a
reefing
job
the
downhaul
parted
and
came
down
on
deck
from
the
peak
of
the
spanker
when
the
weather
moderated
and
we
shook
the
reefs
out
the
downhaul
was
forgotten
until
we
happened
to
think
we
might
soon
need
it
again
there
was
some
sea
on
and
the
boom
was
off
and
the
gaff
was
slamming
one
of
those
benton
boys
was
at
the
wheel
and
before
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
the
other
was
out
on
the
gaff
with
the
end
of
the
new
downhaul
trying
to
reeve
it
through
its
block
the
one
who
was
steering
watched
him
and
got
as
white
as
cheese
the
other
one
was
swinging
about
on
the
gaff
end
and
every
time
she
rolled
to
leeward
he
brought
up
with
a
jerk
that
would
have
sent
anything
but
a
monkey
flying
into
space
but
he
did
leave
it
until
he
had
rove
the
new
rope
and
he
got
back
all
right
i
think
it
was
jack
at
the
wheel
the
one
that
seemed
more
cheerful
the
one
that
whistled
nancy
lee
he
had
rather
have
been
doing
the
job
himself
than
watch
his
brother
do
it
and
he
had
a
scared
look
but
he
kept
her
as
steady
as
he
could
in
the
swell
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
when
jim
had
worked
his
way
back
to
the
block
and
had
something
to
hold
on
to
i
think
it
was
jim
they
had
good
togs
too
and
they
were
neat
and
clean
men
in
the
forecastle
i
knew
they
had
nobody
belonging
to
them
ashore
no
mother
no
sisters
and
no
wives
but
somehow
they
both
looked
as
if
a
woman
overhauled
them
now
and
then
i
remember
that
they
had
one
ditty
bag
between
them
and
they
had
a
woman
thimble
in
it
one
of
the
men
said
something
about
it
to
them
and
they
looked
at
each
other
and
one
smiled
but
the
other
did
most
of
their
clothes
were
alike
but
they
had
one
red
guernsey
between
them
for
some
time
i
used
to
think
it
was
always
the
same
one
that
wore
it
and
i
thought
that
might
be
a
way
to
tell
them
apart
but
then
i
heard
one
asking
the
other
for
it
and
saying
that
the
other
had
worn
it
last
so
that
was
no
sign
either
the
cook
was
a
west
indiaman
called
james
lawley
his
father
had
been
hanged
for
putting
lights
in
cocoanut
trees
where
they
did
belong
but
he
was
a
good
cook
and
knew
his
business
and
it
and
every
sunday
that
what
i
meant
to
say
on
sunday
the
cook
called
both
those
boys
jim
and
on
weekdays
he
called
them
jack
he
used
to
say
he
must
be
right
sometimes
if
he
did
that
because
even
the
hands
on
a
painted
clock
point
right
twice
a
day
what
started
me
to
trying
for
some
way
of
telling
the
bentons
apart
was
this
i
heard
them
talking
about
a
girl
it
was
at
night
in
our
watch
and
the
wind
had
headed
us
off
a
little
rather
suddenly
and
when
we
had
flattened
in
the
jibs
we
clewed
down
the
topsails
while
the
two
benton
boys
got
the
spanker
sheet
aft
one
of
them
was
at
the
helm
i
coiled
down
the
downhaul
myself
and
was
going
aft
to
see
how
she
headed
up
when
i
stopped
to
look
at
a
light
and
leaned
against
the
while
i
was
standing
there
i
heard
the
two
boys
talking
it
sounded
as
if
they
had
talked
of
the
same
thing
before
and
as
far
as
i
could
tell
the
voice
i
heard
first
belonged
to
the
one
who
was
quite
so
cheerful
as
the
other
the
one
who
was
jim
when
one
knew
which
he
was
does
mamie
know
jim
asked
not
yet
jack
answered
quietly
he
was
at
the
wheel
i
mean
to
tell
her
next
time
we
get
home
all
right
that
was
all
i
heard
because
i
did
care
to
stand
there
listening
while
they
were
talking
about
their
own
affairs
so
i
went
aft
to
look
into
the
binnacle
and
i
told
the
one
at
the
wheel
to
keep
her
so
as
long
as
she
had
way
on
her
for
i
thought
the
wind
would
back
up
again
before
long
and
there
was
land
to
leeward
when
he
answered
his
voice
somehow
did
sound
like
the
cheerful
one
perhaps
his
brother
had
relieved
the
wheel
while
they
had
been
speaking
but
what
i
had
heard
set
me
wondering
which
of
them
it
was
that
had
a
girl
at
home
lots
of
time
for
wondering
on
a
schooner
in
fair
weather
after
that
i
thought
i
noticed
that
the
two
brothers
were
more
silent
when
they
were
together
perhaps
they
guessed
that
i
had
overheard
something
that
night
and
kept
quiet
when
i
was
about
some
men
would
have
amused
themselves
by
trying
to
chaff
them
separately
about
the
girl
at
home
and
i
suppose
whichever
one
it
was
would
have
let
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
if
i
had
done
that
but
somehow
i
did
like
to
yes
i
was
thinking
of
getting
married
myself
at
that
time
so
i
had
a
sort
of
for
whichever
one
it
was
that
made
me
not
want
to
chaff
him
they
did
talk
much
it
seemed
to
me
but
in
fair
weather
when
there
was
nothing
to
do
at
night
and
one
was
steering
the
other
was
everlastingly
hanging
round
as
if
he
were
waiting
to
relieve
the
wheel
though
he
might
have
been
enjoying
a
quiet
nap
for
all
i
cared
in
such
weather
or
else
when
one
was
taking
his
turn
at
the
lookout
the
other
would
be
sitting
on
an
anchor
beside
him
one
kept
near
the
other
at
night
more
than
in
the
daytime
i
noticed
that
they
were
fond
of
sitting
on
that
anchor
and
they
generally
tucked
away
their
pipes
under
it
for
the
was
a
dry
boat
in
most
weather
and
like
most
was
better
on
a
wind
than
going
free
with
a
beam
sea
we
sometimes
shipped
a
little
water
aft
we
were
by
the
stern
anyhow
on
that
voyage
and
that
is
one
reason
why
we
lost
the
man
we
fell
in
with
a
southerly
gale
southeast
at
first
and
then
the
barometer
began
to
fall
while
you
could
watch
it
and
a
long
swell
began
to
come
up
from
the
a
couple
of
months
earlier
we
might
have
been
in
for
a
cyclone
but
it
october
all
over
in
those
waters
as
you
know
better
than
i
it
was
just
going
to
blow
and
then
it
was
to
rain
that
was
all
and
we
had
plenty
of
time
to
make
everything
snug
before
it
breezed
up
much
it
blew
harder
after
sunset
and
by
the
time
it
was
quite
dark
it
was
a
full
gale
we
had
shortened
sail
for
it
but
as
we
were
by
the
stern
we
were
carrying
the
spanker
close
reefed
instead
of
the
storm
trysail
she
steered
better
so
as
long
as
we
did
have
to
heave
to
i
had
the
first
watch
with
the
benton
boys
and
we
had
not
been
on
deck
an
hour
when
a
child
might
have
seen
that
the
weather
meant
business
the
old
man
came
up
on
deck
and
looked
round
and
in
less
than
a
minute
he
told
us
to
give
her
the
trysail
that
meant
heaving
to
and
i
was
glad
of
it
for
though
the
was
a
good
vessel
enough
she
was
a
new
ship
by
a
long
way
and
it
did
her
no
good
to
drive
her
in
that
weather
i
asked
whether
i
should
call
all
hands
but
just
then
the
cook
came
aft
and
the
old
man
said
he
thought
we
could
manage
the
job
without
waking
the
sleepers
and
the
trysail
was
handy
on
deck
already
for
we
had
been
expecting
anything
better
we
were
all
in
oilskins
of
course
and
the
night
was
as
black
as
a
coal
mine
with
only
a
ray
of
light
from
the
slit
in
the
binnacle
shield
and
you
could
tell
one
man
from
another
except
by
his
voice
the
old
man
took
the
wheel
we
got
the
boom
amidships
and
he
jammed
her
into
the
wind
until
she
had
hardly
any
way
it
was
blowing
now
and
it
was
all
that
i
and
two
others
could
do
to
get
in
the
slack
of
the
downhaul
while
the
others
lowered
away
at
the
peak
and
throat
and
we
had
our
hands
full
to
get
a
couple
of
turns
round
the
wet
sail
it
all
child
play
on
a
compared
with
reefing
topsails
in
anything
like
weather
but
the
gear
of
a
schooner
sometimes
does
unhandy
things
that
you
do
expect
and
those
everlasting
long
halliards
get
foul
of
everything
if
they
get
adrift
i
remember
thinking
how
unhandy
that
particular
job
was
somebody
unhooked
the
block
and
thought
he
had
hooked
it
into
the
of
the
trysail
and
sang
out
to
hoist
away
but
he
had
missed
it
in
the
dark
and
the
heavy
block
went
flying
into
the
lee
rigging
and
nearly
killed
him
when
it
swung
back
with
the
weather
roll
then
the
old
man
got
her
up
in
the
wind
until
the
jib
was
shaking
like
thunder
then
he
held
her
off
and
she
went
off
as
soon
as
the
headsails
filled
and
he
could
get
her
back
again
without
the
spanker
then
the
did
her
favourite
trick
and
before
we
had
time
to
say
much
we
had
a
sea
over
the
quarter
and
were
up
to
our
waists
with
the
parrels
of
the
trysail
only
half
becketed
round
the
mast
and
the
deck
so
full
of
gear
that
you
could
put
your
foot
on
a
plank
and
the
spanker
beginning
to
get
adrift
again
being
badly
stopped
and
the
general
confusion
and
hell
delight
that
you
can
only
have
on
a
when
there
nothing
really
serious
the
matter
of
course
i
do
mean
to
say
that
the
old
man
could
have
steered
his
trick
as
well
as
you
or
i
or
any
other
seaman
but
i
do
believe
he
had
ever
been
on
board
the
before
or
had
his
hand
on
her
wheel
till
then
and
he
did
know
her
ways
i
do
mean
to
say
that
what
happened
was
his
fault
i
do
know
whose
fault
it
was
perhaps
nobody
was
to
blame
but
i
knew
something
happened
somewhere
on
board
when
we
shipped
that
sea
and
you
never
get
it
out
of
my
head
i
had
any
spare
time
myself
for
i
was
becketing
the
rest
of
the
trysail
to
the
mast
we
were
on
the
starboard
tack
and
the
came
down
to
port
as
usual
and
i
suppose
there
were
at
least
three
men
at
it
hoisting
away
while
i
was
at
the
beckets
now
i
am
going
to
tell
you
something
you
have
known
me
man
and
boy
several
voyages
and
you
are
older
than
i
am
and
you
have
always
been
a
good
friend
to
me
now
do
you
think
i
am
the
sort
of
man
to
think
i
hear
things
where
there
is
anything
to
hear
or
to
think
i
see
things
when
there
is
nothing
to
see
no
you
do
thank
you
well
now
i
had
passed
the
last
becket
and
i
sang
out
to
the
men
to
sway
away
and
i
was
standing
on
the
jaws
of
the
with
my
left
hand
on
the
of
the
trysail
so
that
i
could
feel
when
it
was
and
i
was
thinking
of
anything
except
being
glad
the
job
was
over
and
that
we
were
going
to
heave
her
to
it
was
as
black
as
a
except
that
you
could
see
the
streaks
on
the
seas
as
they
went
by
and
abaft
the
i
could
see
the
ray
of
light
from
the
binnacle
on
the
captain
yellow
oilskin
as
he
stood
at
the
wheel
or
rather
i
might
have
seen
it
if
i
had
looked
round
at
that
minute
but
i
did
look
round
i
heard
a
man
whistling
it
was
nancy
lee
and
i
could
have
sworn
that
the
man
was
right
over
my
head
in
the
crosstrees
only
somehow
i
knew
very
well
that
if
anybody
could
have
been
up
there
and
could
have
whistled
a
tune
there
were
no
living
ears
sharp
enough
to
hear
it
on
deck
then
i
heard
it
distinctly
and
at
the
same
time
i
heard
the
real
whistling
of
the
wind
in
the
weather
rigging
sharp
and
clear
as
the
on
a
dago
in
new
york
that
was
all
right
that
was
as
it
should
be
but
the
other
was
right
and
i
felt
queer
and
stiff
as
if
i
could
move
and
my
hair
was
curling
against
the
flannel
lining
of
my
and
i
thought
somebody
had
dropped
a
lump
of
ice
down
my
back
i
said
that
the
noise
of
the
wind
in
the
rigging
was
real
as
if
the
other
was
for
i
felt
that
it
was
though
i
heard
it
but
it
was
all
the
same
for
the
captain
heard
it
too
when
i
came
to
relieve
the
wheel
while
the
men
were
clearing
up
decks
he
was
swearing
he
was
a
quiet
man
and
i
had
heard
him
swear
before
and
i
do
think
i
did
again
though
several
queer
things
happened
after
that
perhaps
he
said
all
he
had
to
say
then
i
do
see
how
he
could
have
said
anything
more
i
used
to
think
nobody
could
swear
like
a
dane
except
a
neapolitan
or
a
south
american
but
when
i
had
heard
the
old
man
i
changed
my
mind
there
nothing
afloat
or
ashore
that
can
beat
one
of
your
quiet
american
skippers
if
he
gets
off
on
that
tack
i
did
need
to
ask
him
what
was
the
matter
for
i
knew
he
had
heard
nancy
lee
as
i
had
only
it
affected
us
differently
he
did
not
give
me
the
wheel
but
told
me
to
go
forward
and
get
the
second
bonnet
off
the
staysail
so
as
to
keep
her
up
better
as
we
tailed
on
to
the
sheet
when
it
was
done
the
man
next
me
knocked
his
off
against
my
shoulder
and
his
face
came
so
close
to
me
that
i
could
see
it
in
the
dark
it
must
have
been
very
white
for
me
to
see
it
but
i
only
thought
of
that
afterwards
i
do
see
how
any
light
could
have
fallen
upon
it
but
i
knew
it
was
one
of
the
benton
boys
i
do
know
what
made
me
speak
to
him
hullo
jim
is
that
you
i
asked
i
do
know
why
i
said
jim
rather
than
jack
i
am
jack
he
answered
we
made
all
fast
and
things
were
much
quieter
the
old
man
heard
you
whistling
lee
just
now
i
said
and
he
did
like
it
it
was
as
if
there
were
a
white
light
inside
his
face
and
it
was
ghastly
i
know
his
teeth
chattered
but
he
did
say
anything
and
the
next
minute
he
was
somewhere
in
the
dark
trying
to
find
his
at
the
foot
of
the
mast
when
all
was
quiet
and
she
was
hove
to
coming
to
and
falling
off
her
four
points
as
regularly
as
a
pendulum
and
the
helm
lashed
a
little
to
the
lee
the
old
man
turned
in
again
and
i
managed
to
light
a
pipe
in
the
lee
of
the
for
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
till
the
gale
chose
to
moderate
and
the
ship
was
as
easy
as
a
baby
in
its
cradle
of
course
the
cook
had
gone
below
as
he
might
have
done
an
hour
earlier
so
there
were
supposed
to
be
four
of
us
in
the
watch
there
was
a
man
at
the
lookout
and
there
was
a
hand
by
the
wheel
though
there
was
no
steering
to
be
done
and
i
was
having
my
pipe
in
the
lee
of
the
and
the
fourth
man
was
somewhere
about
decks
probably
having
a
smoke
too
i
thought
some
skippers
i
had
sailed
with
would
have
called
the
watch
aft
and
given
them
a
drink
after
that
job
but
it
was
cold
and
i
guessed
that
our
old
man
would
be
particularly
generous
in
that
way
my
hands
and
feet
were
and
it
would
be
time
enough
to
get
into
dry
clothes
when
it
was
my
watch
below
so
i
stayed
where
i
was
and
smoked
but
by
and
by
things
being
so
quiet
i
began
to
wonder
why
nobody
moved
on
deck
just
that
sort
of
restless
wanting
to
know
where
every
man
is
that
one
sometimes
feels
in
a
gale
of
wind
on
a
dark
night
so
when
i
had
finished
my
pipe
i
began
to
move
about
i
went
aft
and
there
was
a
man
leaning
over
the
wheel
with
his
legs
apart
and
both
hands
hanging
down
in
the
light
from
the
binnacle
and
his
over
his
eyes
then
i
went
forward
and
there
was
a
man
at
the
lookout
with
his
back
against
the
foremast
getting
what
shelter
he
could
from
the
staysail
i
knew
by
his
small
height
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
benton
boys
then
i
went
round
by
the
weather
side
and
poked
about
in
the
dark
for
i
began
to
wonder
where
the
other
man
was
but
i
could
find
him
though
i
searched
the
decks
until
i
got
right
aft
again
it
was
certainly
one
of
the
benton
boys
that
was
missing
but
it
was
like
either
of
them
to
go
below
to
change
his
clothes
in
such
warm
weather
the
man
at
the
wheel
was
the
other
of
course
i
spoke
to
him
jim
what
become
of
your
brother
i
am
jack
sir
well
then
jack
where
jim
he
not
on
deck
i
do
know
sir
when
i
had
come
up
to
him
he
had
stood
up
from
force
of
instinct
and
had
laid
his
hands
on
the
spokes
as
if
he
were
steering
though
the
wheel
was
lashed
but
he
still
bent
his
face
down
and
it
was
half
hidden
by
the
edge
of
his
while
he
seemed
to
be
staring
at
the
compass
he
spoke
in
a
very
low
voice
but
that
was
natural
for
the
captain
had
left
his
door
open
when
he
turned
in
as
it
was
a
warm
night
in
spite
of
the
storm
and
there
was
no
fear
of
shipping
any
more
water
now
what
put
it
into
your
head
to
whistle
like
that
jack
you
been
at
sea
long
enough
to
know
better
he
said
something
but
i
could
hear
the
words
it
sounded
as
if
he
were
denying
the
charge
somebody
whistled
i
said
he
did
answer
and
then
i
do
know
why
perhaps
because
the
old
man
had
given
us
a
drink
i
cut
half
an
inch
off
the
plug
of
tobacco
i
had
in
my
oilskin
pocket
and
gave
it
to
him
he
knew
my
tobacco
was
good
and
he
shoved
it
into
his
mouth
with
a
word
of
thanks
i
was
on
the
weather
side
of
the
wheel
go
forward
and
see
if
you
can
find
jim
i
said
he
started
a
little
and
then
stepped
back
and
passed
behind
me
and
was
going
along
the
weather
side
maybe
his
silence
about
the
whistling
had
irritated
me
and
his
taking
it
for
granted
that
because
we
were
hove
to
and
it
was
a
dark
night
he
might
go
forward
any
way
he
pleased
anyhow
i
stopped
him
though
i
spoke
enough
pass
to
leeward
jack
i
said
he
did
answer
but
crossed
the
deck
between
the
binnacle
and
the
to
the
lee
side
she
was
only
falling
off
and
coming
to
and
riding
the
big
seas
as
easily
as
possible
but
the
man
was
not
steady
on
his
feet
and
reeled
against
the
corner
of
the
and
then
against
the
lee
rail
i
was
quite
sure
he
could
have
had
anything
to
drink
for
neither
of
the
brothers
were
the
kind
to
hide
rum
from
their
shipmates
if
they
had
any
and
the
only
spirits
that
were
aboard
were
locked
up
in
the
captain
cabin
i
wondered
whether
he
had
been
hit
by
the
block
and
was
hurt
i
left
the
wheel
and
went
after
him
but
when
i
got
to
the
corner
of
the
i
saw
that
he
was
on
a
full
run
forward
so
i
went
back
i
watched
the
compass
for
a
while
to
see
how
far
she
went
off
and
she
must
have
come
to
again
half
a
dozen
times
before
i
heard
voices
more
than
three
or
four
forward
and
then
i
heard
the
little
west
indies
cook
voice
high
and
shrill
above
the
rest
man
overboard
there
was
anything
to
be
done
with
the
ship
hove
to
and
the
wheel
lashed
if
there
was
a
man
overboard
he
must
be
in
the
water
right
alongside
i
could
imagine
how
it
could
have
happened
but
i
ran
forward
instinctively
i
came
upon
the
cook
first
half
dressed
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
just
as
he
had
tumbled
out
of
his
bunk
he
was
jumping
into
the
main
rigging
evidently
hoping
to
see
the
man
as
if
any
one
could
have
seen
anything
on
such
a
night
except
the
on
the
black
water
and
now
and
then
the
curl
of
a
breaking
sea
as
it
went
away
to
leeward
several
of
the
men
were
peering
over
the
rail
into
the
dark
i
caught
the
cook
by
the
foot
and
asked
who
was
gone
it
jim
benton
he
shouted
down
to
me
he
not
aboard
this
ship
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
jim
benton
was
gone
and
i
knew
in
a
flash
that
he
had
been
taken
off
by
that
sea
when
we
were
setting
the
storm
trysail
it
was
nearly
half
an
hour
since
then
she
had
run
like
wild
for
a
few
minutes
until
we
got
her
hove
to
and
no
swimmer
that
ever
swam
could
have
lived
as
long
as
that
in
such
a
sea
the
men
knew
it
as
well
as
i
but
still
they
stared
into
the
foam
as
if
they
had
any
chance
of
seeing
the
lost
man
i
let
the
cook
get
into
the
rigging
and
joined
the
men
and
asked
if
they
had
made
a
thorough
search
on
board
though
i
knew
they
had
and
that
it
could
not
take
long
for
he
was
on
deck
and
there
was
only
the
forecastle
below
that
sea
took
him
over
sir
as
sure
as
you
born
said
one
of
the
men
close
beside
me
we
had
no
boat
that
could
have
lived
in
that
sea
of
course
and
we
all
knew
it
i
offered
to
put
one
over
and
let
her
drift
astern
two
or
three
cables
lengths
by
a
line
if
the
men
thought
they
could
haul
me
aboard
again
but
none
of
them
would
listen
to
that
and
i
should
probably
have
been
drowned
if
i
had
tried
it
even
with
a
for
it
was
a
breaking
sea
besides
they
all
knew
as
well
as
i
did
that
the
man
could
not
be
right
in
our
wake
i
do
know
why
i
spoke
again
jack
benton
are
you
there
will
you
go
if
i
will
no
sir
answered
a
voice
and
that
was
all
by
that
time
the
old
man
was
on
deck
and
i
felt
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
rather
roughly
as
if
he
meant
to
shake
me
i
reckoned
you
had
more
sense
torkeldsen
he
said
god
knows
i
would
risk
my
ship
to
look
for
him
if
it
were
any
use
but
he
must
have
gone
half
an
hour
ago
he
was
a
quiet
man
and
the
men
knew
he
was
right
and
that
they
had
seen
the
last
of
jim
benton
when
they
were
bending
the
trysail
if
anybody
had
seen
him
then
the
captain
went
below
again
and
for
some
time
the
men
stood
around
jack
quite
near
him
without
saying
anything
as
sailors
do
when
they
are
sorry
for
a
man
and
ca
help
him
and
then
the
watch
below
turned
in
again
and
we
were
three
on
deck
nobody
can
understand
that
there
can
be
much
consolation
in
a
funeral
unless
he
has
felt
that
blank
feeling
there
is
when
a
man
gone
overboard
whom
everybody
likes
i
suppose
landsmen
think
it
would
be
easier
if
they
did
have
to
bury
their
fathers
and
mothers
and
friends
but
it
would
be
somehow
the
funeral
keeps
up
the
idea
of
something
beyond
you
may
believe
in
that
something
just
the
same
but
a
man
who
has
gone
in
the
dark
between
two
seas
without
a
cry
seems
much
more
beyond
reach
than
if
he
were
still
lying
on
his
bed
and
had
only
just
stopped
breathing
perhaps
jim
benton
knew
that
and
wanted
to
come
back
to
us
i
do
know
and
i
am
only
telling
you
what
happened
and
you
may
think
what
you
like
jack
stuck
by
the
wheel
that
night
until
the
watch
was
over
i
know
whether
he
slept
afterwards
but
when
i
came
on
deck
four
hours
later
there
he
was
again
in
his
oilskins
with
his
over
his
eyes
staring
into
the
binnacle
we
saw
that
he
would
rather
stand
there
and
we
left
him
alone
perhaps
it
was
some
consolation
to
him
to
get
that
ray
of
light
when
everything
was
so
dark
it
began
to
rain
too
as
it
can
when
a
southerly
gale
is
going
to
break
up
and
we
got
every
bucket
and
tub
on
board
and
set
them
under
the
booms
to
catch
the
fresh
water
for
washing
our
clothes
the
rain
made
it
very
thick
and
i
went
and
stood
under
the
lee
of
the
staysail
looking
out
i
could
tell
that
day
was
breaking
because
the
foam
was
whiter
in
the
dark
where
the
seas
crested
and
little
by
little
the
black
rain
grew
grey
and
steamy
and
i
could
see
the
red
glare
of
the
port
light
on
the
water
when
she
went
off
and
rolled
to
leeward
the
gale
had
moderated
considerably
and
in
another
hour
we
should
be
under
way
again
i
was
still
standing
there
when
jack
benton
came
forward
he
stood
still
a
few
minutes
near
me
the
rain
came
down
in
a
solid
sheet
and
i
could
see
his
wet
beard
and
a
corner
of
his
cheek
too
grey
in
the
dawn
then
he
stooped
down
and
began
feeling
under
the
anchor
for
his
pipe
we
had
hardly
shipped
any
water
forward
and
i
suppose
he
had
some
way
of
tucking
the
pipe
in
so
that
the
rain
had
floated
it
off
presently
he
got
on
his
legs
again
and
i
saw
that
he
had
two
pipes
in
his
hand
one
of
them
had
belonged
to
his
brother
and
after
looking
at
them
a
moment
i
suppose
he
recognized
his
own
for
he
put
it
in
his
mouth
dripping
with
water
then
he
looked
at
the
other
fully
a
minute
without
moving
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
i
suppose
he
quietly
chucked
it
over
the
lee
rail
without
even
looking
round
to
see
whether
i
was
watching
him
i
thought
it
was
a
pity
for
it
was
a
good
wooden
pipe
with
a
nickel
ferrule
and
somebody
would
have
been
glad
to
have
it
but
i
did
like
to
make
any
remark
for
he
had
a
right
to
do
what
he
pleased
with
what
had
belonged
to
his
dead
brother
he
blew
the
water
out
of
his
own
pipe
and
dried
it
against
his
jacket
putting
his
hand
inside
his
oilskin
he
filled
it
standing
under
the
lee
of
the
foremast
got
a
light
after
wasting
two
or
three
matches
and
turned
the
pipe
upside
down
in
his
teeth
to
keep
the
rain
out
of
the
bowl
i
do
know
why
i
noticed
everything
he
did
and
remember
it
now
but
somehow
i
felt
sorry
for
him
and
i
kept
wondering
whether
there
was
anything
i
could
say
that
would
make
him
feel
better
but
i
did
think
of
anything
and
as
it
was
broad
daylight
i
went
aft
again
for
i
guessed
that
the
old
man
would
turn
out
before
long
and
order
the
spanker
set
and
the
helm
up
but
he
did
turn
out
before
seven
bells
just
as
the
clouds
broke
and
showed
blue
sky
to
leeward
the
frenchman
barometer
you
used
to
call
it
some
people
do
seem
to
be
so
dead
when
they
are
dead
as
others
are
jim
benton
was
like
that
he
had
been
on
my
watch
and
i
could
get
used
to
the
idea
that
he
was
about
decks
with
me
i
was
always
expecting
to
see
him
and
his
brother
was
so
exactly
like
him
that
i
often
felt
as
if
i
did
see
him
and
forgot
he
was
dead
and
made
the
mistake
of
calling
jack
by
his
name
though
i
tried
not
to
because
i
knew
it
must
hurt
if
ever
jack
had
been
the
cheerful
one
of
the
two
as
i
had
always
supposed
he
had
been
he
had
changed
very
much
for
he
grew
to
be
more
silent
than
jim
had
ever
been
one
fine
afternoon
i
was
sitting
on
the
overhauling
the
clockwork
of
the
which
had
been
registering
very
well
of
late
and
i
had
got
the
cook
to
bring
me
a
to
hold
the
small
screws
as
i
took
them
out
and
a
saucer
for
the
sperm
oil
i
was
going
to
use
i
noticed
that
he
did
go
away
but
hung
round
without
exactly
watching
what
i
was
doing
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
me
i
thought
if
it
were
worth
much
he
would
say
it
anyhow
so
i
ask
him
questions
and
sure
enough
he
began
of
his
own
accord
before
long
there
was
nobody
on
deck
but
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
the
other
man
away
forward
torkeldsen
the
cook
began
and
then
stopped
i
supposed
he
was
going
to
ask
me
to
let
the
watch
break
out
a
barrel
of
flour
or
some
salt
horse
well
doctor
i
asked
as
he
did
go
on
well
torkeldsen
he
answered
i
somehow
want
to
ask
you
whether
you
think
i
am
giving
satisfaction
on
this
ship
or
not
so
far
as
i
know
you
are
doctor
i
have
heard
any
complaints
from
the
forecastle
and
the
captain
has
said
nothing
and
i
think
you
know
your
business
and
the
is
bursting
out
of
his
clothes
that
looks
as
if
you
are
giving
satisfaction
what
makes
you
think
you
are
not
i
am
not
good
at
giving
you
that
west
indies
talk
and
sha
try
but
the
doctor
beat
about
the
bush
awhile
and
then
he
told
me
he
thought
the
men
were
beginning
to
play
tricks
on
him
and
he
did
like
it
and
thought
he
had
deserved
it
and
would
like
his
discharge
at
our
next
port
i
told
him
he
was
a
d
d
fool
of
course
to
begin
with
and
that
men
were
more
apt
to
try
a
joke
with
a
chap
they
liked
than
with
anybody
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
unless
it
was
a
bad
joke
like
flooding
his
bunk
or
filling
his
boots
with
tar
but
it
was
that
kind
of
practical
joke
the
doctor
said
that
the
men
were
trying
to
frighten
him
and
he
did
like
it
and
that
they
put
things
in
his
way
that
frightened
him
so
i
told
him
he
was
a
d
d
fool
to
be
frightened
anyway
and
i
wanted
to
know
what
things
they
put
in
his
way
he
gave
me
a
queer
answer
he
said
they
were
spoons
and
forks
and
odd
plates
and
a
cup
now
and
then
and
such
things
i
set
down
the
on
the
bit
of
canvas
i
had
put
under
it
and
looked
at
the
doctor
he
was
uneasy
and
his
eyes
had
a
sort
of
hunted
look
and
his
yellow
face
looked
grey
he
was
trying
to
make
trouble
he
was
in
trouble
so
i
asked
him
questions
he
said
he
could
count
as
well
as
anybody
and
do
sums
without
using
his
fingers
but
that
when
he
could
count
any
other
way
he
did
use
his
fingers
and
it
always
came
out
the
same
he
said
that
when
he
and
the
cleared
up
after
the
men
meals
there
were
more
things
to
wash
than
he
had
given
out
there
be
a
fork
more
or
there
be
a
spoon
more
and
sometimes
there
be
a
spoon
and
a
fork
and
there
was
always
a
plate
more
it
was
that
he
complained
of
that
before
poor
jim
benton
was
lost
they
had
a
man
more
to
feed
and
his
gear
to
wash
up
after
meals
and
that
was
in
the
contract
the
doctor
said
it
would
have
been
if
there
were
twenty
in
the
ship
company
but
he
think
it
was
right
for
the
men
to
play
tricks
like
that
he
kept
his
things
in
good
order
and
he
counted
them
and
he
was
responsible
for
them
and
it
was
right
that
the
men
should
take
more
things
than
they
needed
when
his
back
was
turned
and
just
soil
them
and
mix
them
up
with
their
own
so
as
to
make
him
think
he
stopped
there
and
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
him
i
did
know
what
he
thought
but
i
began
to
guess
i
was
going
to
humour
any
such
nonsense
as
that
so
i
told
him
to
speak
to
the
men
himself
and
not
come
bothering
me
about
such
things
count
the
plates
and
forks
and
spoons
before
them
when
they
sit
down
to
table
and
tell
them
that
all
they
get
and
when
they
have
finished
count
the
things
again
and
if
the
count
is
right
find
out
who
did
it
you
know
it
must
be
one
of
them
you
not
a
green
hand
you
been
going
to
sea
ten
or
eleven
years
and
do
want
any
lessons
about
how
to
behave
if
the
boys
play
a
trick
on
you
if
i
could
catch
him
said
the
cook
i
have
a
knife
into
him
before
he
could
say
his
prayers
those
west
india
men
are
always
talking
about
knives
especially
when
they
are
badly
frightened
i
knew
what
he
meant
and
did
ask
him
but
went
on
cleaning
the
brass
of
the
patent
log
and
oiling
the
bearings
with
a
feather
would
it
be
better
to
wash
it
out
with
boiling
water
sir
asked
the
cook
in
an
insinuating
tone
he
knew
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
and
was
anxious
to
make
it
right
again
i
heard
no
more
about
the
odd
platter
and
gear
for
two
or
three
days
though
i
thought
about
his
story
a
good
deal
the
doctor
evidently
believed
that
jim
benton
had
come
back
though
he
did
quite
like
to
say
so
his
story
had
sounded
silly
enough
on
a
bright
afternoon
in
fair
weather
when
the
sun
was
on
the
water
and
every
rag
was
drawing
in
the
breeze
and
the
sea
looked
as
pleasant
and
as
harmless
as
a
cat
that
has
just
eaten
a
canary
but
when
it
was
toward
the
end
of
the
first
watch
and
the
waning
moon
had
not
risen
yet
and
the
water
was
like
still
oil
and
the
jibs
hung
down
flat
and
helpless
like
the
wings
of
a
dead
bird
it
was
the
same
then
more
than
once
i
have
started
then
and
looked
round
when
a
fish
jumped
expecting
to
see
a
face
sticking
out
of
the
water
with
its
eyes
shut
i
think
we
all
felt
something
like
that
at
the
time
one
afternoon
we
were
putting
a
fresh
service
on
the
it
was
my
watch
but
i
was
standing
by
looking
on
just
then
jack
benton
came
up
from
below
and
went
to
look
for
his
pipe
under
the
anchor
his
face
was
hard
and
drawn
and
his
eyes
were
cold
like
steel
balls
he
hardly
ever
spoke
now
but
he
did
his
duty
as
usual
and
nobody
had
to
complain
of
him
though
we
were
all
beginning
to
wonder
how
long
his
grief
for
his
dead
brother
was
going
to
last
like
that
i
watched
him
as
he
crouched
down
and
ran
his
hand
into
the
for
the
pipe
when
he
stood
up
he
had
two
pipes
in
his
hand
now
i
remembered
very
well
seeing
him
throw
one
of
those
pipes
away
early
in
the
morning
after
the
gale
and
it
came
to
me
now
and
i
suppose
he
kept
a
stock
of
them
under
the
anchor
i
caught
sight
of
his
face
and
it
was
greenish
white
like
the
foam
on
shallow
water
and
he
stood
a
long
time
looking
at
the
two
pipes
he
was
looking
to
see
which
was
his
for
i
was
five
yards
from
him
as
he
stood
and
one
of
those
pipes
had
been
smoked
that
day
and
was
shiny
where
his
hand
had
rubbed
it
and
the
bone
mouthpiece
was
chafed
white
where
his
teeth
had
bitten
it
the
other
was
it
was
swelled
and
cracking
with
wet
and
it
looked
to
me
as
if
there
were
a
little
green
weed
on
it
jack
benton
turned
his
head
rather
stealthily
as
i
looked
away
and
then
he
hid
the
thing
in
his
trousers
pocket
and
went
aft
on
the
lee
side
out
of
sight
the
men
had
got
the
on
a
stretch
to
serve
it
but
i
ducked
under
it
and
stood
where
i
could
see
what
jack
did
just
under
the
he
could
see
me
and
he
was
looking
about
for
something
his
hand
shook
as
he
picked
up
a
bit
of
iron
rod
about
a
foot
long
that
had
been
used
for
turning
an
and
had
been
left
on
the
his
hand
shook
as
he
got
a
piece
of
marline
out
of
his
pocket
and
made
the
pipe
fast
to
the
iron
he
did
mean
it
to
get
adrift
either
for
he
took
his
turns
carefully
and
hove
them
taut
and
then
rode
them
so
that
they
slip
and
made
the
end
fast
with
two
round
the
iron
and
hitched
it
back
on
itself
then
he
tried
it
with
his
hands
and
looked
up
and
down
the
deck
furtively
and
then
quietly
dropped
the
pipe
and
iron
over
the
rail
so
that
i
did
even
hear
the
splash
if
anybody
was
playing
tricks
on
board
they
were
meant
for
the
cook
i
asked
some
questions
about
jack
benton
and
one
of
the
men
told
me
that
he
was
off
his
feed
and
hardly
ate
anything
and
swallowed
all
the
coffee
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
and
had
used
up
all
his
own
tobacco
and
had
begun
on
what
his
brother
had
left
the
doctor
says
it
ai
so
sir
said
the
man
looking
at
me
shyly
as
if
he
did
expect
to
be
believed
the
doctor
says
there
as
much
eaten
from
breakfast
to
breakfast
as
there
was
before
jim
fell
overboard
though
there
a
mouth
less
and
another
that
eats
nothing
i
says
it
the
that
gets
it
he
i
told
him
that
if
the
ate
more
than
his
share
he
must
work
more
than
his
share
so
as
to
balance
things
but
the
man
laughed
queerly
and
looked
at
me
again
i
only
said
that
sir
just
like
that
we
all
know
it
ai
so
well
how
is
it
how
is
it
asked
the
man
all
at
once
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
there
a
hand
on
board
that
getting
his
whack
along
with
us
as
regular
as
the
bells
does
he
use
tobacco
i
asked
meaning
to
laugh
it
out
of
him
but
as
i
spoke
i
remembered
the
pipe
i
guess
he
using
his
own
still
the
man
answered
in
a
queer
low
voice
perhaps
he
take
some
one
else
when
his
is
all
gone
it
was
about
nine
in
the
morning
i
remember
for
just
then
the
captain
called
to
me
to
stand
by
the
chronometer
while
he
took
his
fore
observation
captain
hackstaff
was
one
of
those
old
skippers
who
do
everything
themselves
with
a
pocket
watch
and
keep
the
key
of
the
chronometer
in
their
waistcoat
pocket
and
wo
tell
the
mate
how
far
the
dead
reckoning
is
out
he
was
rather
the
other
way
and
i
was
glad
of
it
for
he
generally
let
me
work
the
sights
he
took
and
just
ran
his
eye
over
my
figures
afterwards
i
am
bound
to
say
his
eye
was
pretty
good
for
he
would
pick
out
a
mistake
in
a
logarithm
or
tell
me
that
i
had
worked
the
equation
of
time
with
the
wrong
sign
before
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
could
have
got
as
far
as
half
the
sum
minus
the
altitude
he
was
always
right
too
and
besides
he
knew
a
lot
about
iron
ships
and
local
deviation
and
adjusting
the
compass
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
do
know
how
he
came
to
be
in
command
of
a
schooner
he
never
talked
about
himself
and
maybe
he
had
just
been
mate
on
one
of
those
big
steel
and
something
had
put
him
back
perhaps
he
had
been
captain
and
had
got
his
ship
aground
through
no
particular
fault
of
his
and
had
to
begin
over
again
sometimes
he
talked
just
like
you
and
me
and
sometimes
he
would
speak
more
like
books
do
or
some
of
those
boston
people
i
have
heard
i
do
know
we
have
all
been
shipmates
now
and
then
with
men
who
have
seen
better
days
perhaps
he
had
been
in
the
navy
but
what
makes
me
think
he
could
have
been
was
that
he
was
a
thorough
good
seaman
a
regular
old
windjammer
and
understood
sail
which
those
navy
chaps
rarely
do
why
you
and
i
have
sailed
with
men
before
the
mast
who
had
their
master
certificates
in
their
pockets
english
board
of
trade
certificates
too
who
could
work
a
double
altitude
if
you
would
lend
them
a
sextant
and
give
them
a
look
at
the
chronometer
as
well
as
many
a
man
who
commands
a
big
navigation
ai
everything
nor
seamanship
either
you
got
to
have
it
in
you
if
you
mean
to
get
there
i
do
know
how
our
captain
heard
that
there
was
trouble
forward
the
may
have
told
him
or
the
men
may
have
talked
outside
his
door
when
they
relieved
the
wheel
at
night
anyhow
he
got
wind
of
it
and
when
he
had
got
his
sight
that
morning
he
had
all
hands
aft
and
gave
them
a
lecture
it
was
just
the
kind
of
talk
you
might
have
expected
from
him
he
said
he
had
any
complaint
to
make
and
that
so
far
as
he
knew
everybody
on
board
was
doing
his
duty
and
that
he
was
given
to
understand
that
the
men
got
their
whack
and
were
satisfied
he
said
his
ship
was
never
a
hard
ship
and
that
he
liked
quiet
and
that
was
the
reason
he
did
mean
to
have
any
nonsense
and
the
men
might
just
as
well
understand
that
too
we
had
a
great
misfortune
he
said
and
it
was
nobody
fault
we
had
lost
a
man
we
all
liked
and
respected
and
he
felt
that
everybody
in
the
ship
ought
to
be
sorry
for
the
man
brother
who
was
left
behind
and
that
it
was
rotten
lubberly
childishness
and
unjust
and
unmanly
and
cowardly
to
be
playing
schoolboy
tricks
with
forks
and
spoons
and
pipes
and
that
sort
of
gear
he
said
it
had
got
to
stop
right
now
and
that
was
all
and
the
men
might
go
forward
and
so
they
did
it
got
worse
after
that
and
the
men
watched
the
cook
and
the
cook
watched
the
men
as
if
they
were
trying
to
catch
each
other
but
i
think
everybody
felt
that
there
was
something
else
one
evening
at
i
was
on
deck
and
jack
came
aft
to
relieve
the
wheel
while
the
man
who
was
steering
got
his
supper
he
had
got
past
the
on
the
lee
side
when
i
heard
a
man
running
in
slippers
that
slapped
on
the
deck
and
there
was
a
sort
of
a
yell
and
i
saw
the
coloured
cook
going
for
jack
with
a
carving
knife
in
his
hand
i
jumped
to
get
between
them
and
jack
turned
round
short
and
put
out
his
hand
i
was
too
far
to
reach
them
and
the
cook
jabbed
out
with
his
knife
but
the
blade
did
get
anywhere
near
benton
the
cook
seemed
to
be
jabbing
it
into
the
air
again
and
again
at
least
four
feet
short
of
the
mark
then
he
dropped
his
right
hand
and
i
saw
the
whites
of
his
eyes
in
the
dusk
and
he
reeled
up
against
the
and
caught
hold
of
a
with
his
left
i
had
reached
him
by
that
time
and
grabbed
hold
of
his
and
the
other
too
for
i
thought
he
was
going
to
use
the
pin
but
jack
benton
was
standing
staring
stupidly
at
him
as
if
he
did
understand
but
instead
the
cook
was
holding
on
because
he
could
stand
and
his
teeth
were
chattering
and
he
let
go
of
the
knife
and
the
point
stuck
into
the
deck
he
crazy
said
jack
benton
and
that
was
all
he
said
and
he
went
aft
when
he
was
gone
the
cook
began
to
come
to
and
he
spoke
quite
low
near
my
ear
there
were
two
of
them
so
help
me
god
there
were
two
of
them
i
do
know
why
i
did
take
him
by
the
collar
and
give
him
a
good
shaking
but
i
did
i
just
picked
up
the
knife
and
gave
it
to
him
and
told
him
to
go
back
to
his
galley
and
not
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
you
see
he
had
struck
at
jack
but
at
something
he
thought
he
saw
and
i
knew
what
it
was
and
i
felt
that
same
thing
like
a
lump
of
ice
sliding
down
my
back
that
i
felt
that
night
when
we
were
bending
the
trysail
when
the
men
had
seen
him
running
aft
they
jumped
up
after
him
but
they
held
off
when
they
saw
that
i
had
caught
him
by
and
by
the
man
who
had
spoken
to
me
before
told
me
what
had
happened
he
was
a
stocky
little
chap
with
a
red
head
well
he
said
there
is
much
to
tell
jack
benton
had
been
eating
his
supper
with
the
rest
of
us
he
always
sits
at
the
after
corner
of
the
table
on
the
port
side
his
brother
used
to
sit
at
the
end
next
him
the
doctor
gave
him
a
thundering
big
piece
of
pie
to
finish
up
with
and
when
he
had
finished
he
did
stop
for
a
smoke
but
went
off
quick
to
relieve
the
wheel
just
as
he
had
gone
the
doctor
came
in
from
the
galley
and
when
he
saw
jack
empty
plate
he
stood
stock
still
staring
at
it
and
we
all
wondered
what
was
the
matter
till
we
looked
at
the
plate
there
were
two
forks
in
it
sir
lying
side
by
side
then
the
doctor
grabbed
his
knife
and
flew
up
through
the
hatch
like
a
rocket
the
other
fork
was
there
all
right
torkeldsen
for
we
all
saw
it
and
handled
it
and
we
all
had
our
own
that
all
i
know
i
did
feel
that
i
wanted
to
laugh
when
he
told
me
that
story
but
i
hoped
the
old
man
would
hear
it
for
i
knew
he
would
believe
it
and
no
captain
that
ever
sailed
likes
to
have
stories
like
that
going
round
about
his
ship
it
gives
her
a
bad
name
but
that
was
all
anybody
ever
saw
except
the
cook
and
he
is
the
first
man
who
has
thought
he
saw
things
without
having
any
drink
in
him
i
think
if
the
doctor
had
been
weak
in
the
head
as
he
was
afterwards
he
might
have
done
something
foolish
again
and
there
might
have
been
serious
trouble
but
he
did
only
two
or
three
times
i
saw
him
looking
at
jack
benton
in
a
queer
scared
way
and
once
i
heard
him
talking
to
himself
there
two
of
them
so
help
me
god
there
two
of
them
he
did
say
anything
more
about
asking
for
his
discharge
but
i
knew
well
enough
that
if
he
got
ashore
at
the
next
port
we
should
never
see
him
again
if
he
had
to
leave
his
kit
behind
him
and
his
money
too
he
was
scared
all
through
for
good
and
all
and
he
would
be
right
again
till
he
got
another
ship
it
no
use
to
talk
to
a
man
when
he
gets
like
that
any
more
than
it
is
to
send
a
boy
to
the
main
truck
when
he
has
lost
his
nerve
jack
benton
never
spoke
of
what
happened
that
evening
i
do
know
whether
he
knew
about
the
two
forks
or
not
or
whether
he
understood
what
the
trouble
was
whatever
he
knew
from
the
other
men
he
was
evidently
living
under
a
hard
strain
he
was
quiet
enough
and
too
quiet
but
his
face
was
set
and
sometimes
it
twitched
oddly
when
he
was
at
the
wheel
and
he
would
turn
his
head
round
sharp
to
look
behind
him
a
man
does
do
that
naturally
unless
there
a
vessel
that
he
thinks
is
creeping
up
on
the
quarter
when
that
happens
if
the
man
at
the
wheel
takes
a
pride
in
his
ship
he
will
almost
always
keep
glancing
over
his
shoulder
to
see
whether
the
other
fellow
is
gaining
but
jack
benton
used
to
look
round
when
there
was
nothing
there
and
what
is
curious
the
other
men
seemed
to
catch
the
trick
when
they
were
steering
one
day
the
old
man
turned
out
just
as
the
man
at
the
wheel
looked
behind
him
what
are
you
looking
at
asked
the
captain
nothing
sir
answered
the
man
then
keep
your
eye
on
the
said
the
old
man
as
if
he
were
forgetting
that
we
were
a
ay
ay
sir
said
the
man
the
captain
told
me
to
go
below
and
work
up
the
latitude
from
the
and
he
went
forward
of
the
and
sat
down
to
read
as
he
often
did
when
i
came
up
the
man
at
the
wheel
was
looking
round
again
and
i
stood
beside
him
and
just
asked
him
quietly
what
everybody
was
looking
at
for
it
was
getting
to
be
a
general
habit
he
would
say
anything
at
first
but
just
answered
that
it
was
nothing
but
when
he
saw
that
i
did
seem
to
care
and
just
stood
there
as
if
there
were
nothing
more
to
be
said
he
naturally
began
to
talk
he
said
that
it
was
that
he
saw
anything
because
there
anything
to
see
except
the
spanker
sheet
just
straining
a
little
and
working
in
the
sheaves
of
the
blocks
as
the
schooner
rose
to
the
short
seas
there
was
anything
to
be
seen
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
sheet
made
a
queer
noise
in
the
blocks
it
was
a
new
manilla
sheet
and
in
dry
weather
it
did
make
a
little
noise
something
between
a
creak
and
a
wheeze
i
looked
at
it
and
looked
at
the
man
and
said
nothing
and
presently
he
went
on
he
asked
me
if
i
did
notice
anything
peculiar
about
the
noise
i
listened
awhile
and
said
i
did
notice
anything
then
he
looked
rather
sheepish
but
said
he
did
think
it
could
be
his
own
ears
because
every
man
who
steered
his
trick
heard
the
same
thing
now
and
then
sometimes
once
in
a
day
sometimes
once
in
a
night
sometimes
it
would
go
on
a
whole
hour
it
sounds
like
sawing
wood
i
said
just
like
that
to
us
it
sounds
a
good
deal
more
like
a
man
whistling
lee
he
started
nervously
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
there
sir
do
you
hear
it
he
asked
suddenly
i
heard
nothing
but
the
creaking
of
the
manilla
sheet
it
was
getting
near
noon
and
fine
clear
weather
in
southern
waters
just
the
sort
of
day
and
the
time
when
you
would
least
expect
to
feel
creepy
but
i
remembered
how
i
had
heard
that
same
tune
overhead
at
night
in
a
gale
of
wind
a
fortnight
earlier
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
the
same
sensation
came
over
me
now
and
i
wished
myself
well
out
of
the
and
aboard
of
any
old
with
a
windmill
on
deck
and
an
for
captain
and
a
fresh
leak
whenever
it
breezed
up
little
by
little
during
the
next
few
days
life
on
board
that
vessel
came
to
be
about
as
unbearable
as
you
can
imagine
it
was
that
there
was
much
talk
for
i
think
the
men
were
shy
even
of
speaking
to
each
other
freely
about
what
they
thought
the
whole
ship
company
grew
silent
until
one
hardly
ever
heard
a
voice
except
giving
an
order
and
the
answer
the
men
did
sit
over
their
meals
when
their
watch
was
below
but
either
turned
in
at
once
or
sat
about
on
the
forecastle
smoking
their
pipes
without
saying
a
word
we
were
all
thinking
of
the
same
thing
we
all
felt
as
if
there
were
a
hand
on
board
sometimes
below
sometimes
about
decks
sometimes
aloft
sometimes
on
the
boom
end
taking
his
full
share
of
what
the
others
got
but
doing
no
work
for
it
we
did
only
feel
it
we
knew
it
he
took
up
no
room
he
cast
no
shadow
and
we
never
heard
his
footfall
on
deck
but
he
took
his
whack
with
the
rest
as
regular
as
the
bells
and
he
whistled
nancy
lee
it
was
like
the
worst
sort
of
dream
you
can
imagine
and
i
daresay
a
good
many
of
us
tried
to
believe
it
was
nothing
else
sometimes
when
we
stood
looking
over
the
weather
rail
in
fine
weather
with
the
breeze
in
our
faces
but
if
we
happened
to
turn
round
and
look
into
each
other
eyes
we
knew
it
was
something
worse
than
any
dream
could
be
and
we
would
turn
away
from
each
other
with
a
queer
sick
feeling
wishing
that
we
could
just
for
once
see
somebody
who
did
know
what
we
knew
there
not
much
more
to
tell
about
the
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
we
were
more
like
a
shipload
of
lunatics
than
anything
else
when
we
ran
in
under
morro
castle
and
anchored
in
havana
the
cook
had
brain
fever
and
was
raving
mad
in
his
delirium
and
the
rest
of
the
men
were
far
from
the
same
state
the
last
three
or
four
days
had
been
awful
and
we
had
been
as
near
to
having
a
mutiny
on
board
as
i
ever
want
to
be
the
men
did
want
to
hurt
anybody
but
they
wanted
to
get
away
out
of
that
ship
if
they
had
to
swim
for
it
to
get
away
from
that
whistling
from
that
dead
shipmate
who
had
come
back
and
who
filled
the
ship
with
his
unseen
self
i
know
that
if
the
old
man
and
i
had
kept
a
sharp
lookout
the
men
would
have
put
a
boat
over
quietly
on
one
of
those
calm
nights
and
pulled
away
leaving
the
captain
and
me
and
the
mad
cook
to
work
the
schooner
into
harbour
we
should
have
done
it
somehow
of
course
for
we
had
far
to
run
if
we
could
get
a
breeze
and
once
or
twice
i
found
myself
wishing
that
the
crew
were
really
gone
for
the
awful
state
of
fright
in
which
they
lived
was
beginning
to
work
on
me
too
you
see
i
partly
believed
and
partly
did
but
anyhow
i
did
mean
to
let
the
thing
get
the
better
of
me
whatever
it
was
i
turned
crusty
too
and
kept
the
men
at
work
on
all
sorts
of
jobs
and
drove
them
to
it
until
they
wished
i
was
overboard
too
it
was
that
the
old
man
and
i
were
trying
to
drive
them
to
desert
without
their
pay
as
i
am
sorry
to
say
a
good
many
skippers
and
mates
do
even
now
captain
hackstaff
was
as
straight
as
a
string
and
i
did
mean
those
poor
fellows
should
be
cheated
out
of
a
single
cent
and
i
did
blame
them
for
wanting
to
leave
the
ship
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
only
chance
to
keep
everybody
sane
through
those
last
days
was
to
work
the
men
till
they
dropped
when
they
were
dead
tired
they
slept
a
little
and
forgot
the
thing
until
they
had
to
tumble
up
on
deck
and
face
it
again
that
was
a
good
many
years
ago
do
you
believe
that
i
ca
hear
nancy
lee
now
without
feeling
cold
down
my
back
for
i
heard
it
too
now
and
then
after
the
man
had
explained
why
he
was
always
looking
over
his
shoulder
perhaps
it
was
imagination
i
do
know
when
i
look
back
it
seems
to
me
that
i
only
remember
a
long
fight
against
something
i
could
see
against
an
appalling
presence
against
something
worse
than
cholera
or
yellow
jack
or
the
plague
and
goodness
knows
the
mildest
of
them
is
bad
enough
when
it
breaks
out
at
sea
the
men
got
as
white
as
chalk
and
go
about
decks
alone
at
night
no
matter
what
i
said
to
them
with
the
cook
raving
in
his
bunk
the
forecastle
would
have
been
a
perfect
hell
and
there
was
a
spare
cabin
on
board
there
never
is
on
a
so
i
put
him
into
mine
and
he
was
more
quiet
there
and
at
last
fell
into
a
sort
of
stupor
as
if
he
were
going
to
die
i
know
what
became
of
him
for
we
put
him
ashore
alive
and
left
him
in
the
hospital
the
men
came
aft
in
a
body
quiet
enough
and
asked
the
captain
if
he
would
pay
them
off
and
let
them
go
ashore
some
men
would
have
done
it
for
they
had
shipped
for
the
voyage
and
had
signed
articles
but
the
captain
knew
that
when
sailors
get
an
idea
into
their
heads
they
no
better
than
children
and
if
he
forced
them
to
stay
aboard
he
would
get
much
work
out
of
them
and
could
rely
on
them
in
a
difficulty
so
he
paid
them
off
and
let
them
go
when
they
had
gone
forward
to
get
their
kits
he
asked
me
whether
i
wanted
to
go
too
and
for
a
minute
i
had
a
sort
of
weak
feeling
that
i
might
just
as
well
but
i
did
and
he
was
a
good
friend
to
me
afterwards
perhaps
he
was
grateful
to
me
for
sticking
to
him
when
the
men
went
off
he
did
come
on
deck
but
it
was
my
duty
to
stand
by
while
they
left
the
ship
they
owed
me
a
grudge
for
making
them
work
during
the
last
few
days
and
most
of
them
dropped
into
the
boat
without
so
much
as
a
word
or
a
look
as
sailors
will
jack
benton
was
the
last
to
go
over
the
side
and
he
stood
still
a
minute
and
looked
at
me
and
his
white
face
twitched
i
thought
he
wanted
to
say
something
take
care
of
yourself
jack
said
i
so
long
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
speak
for
two
or
three
seconds
then
his
words
came
thick
it
was
my
fault
torkeldsen
i
swear
it
was
my
fault
that
was
all
and
he
dropped
over
the
side
leaving
me
to
wonder
what
he
meant
the
captain
and
i
stayed
on
board
and
the
got
a
west
india
boy
to
cook
for
us
that
evening
before
turning
in
we
were
standing
by
the
rail
having
a
quiet
smoke
watching
the
lights
of
the
city
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
reflected
in
the
still
water
there
was
music
of
some
sort
ashore
in
a
sailors
i
daresay
and
i
had
no
doubt
that
most
of
the
men
who
had
left
the
ship
were
there
and
already
full
of
the
music
played
a
lot
of
sailors
tunes
that
ran
into
each
other
and
we
could
hear
the
men
voices
in
the
chorus
now
and
then
one
followed
another
and
then
it
was
nancy
lee
loud
and
clear
and
the
men
singing
i
have
no
ear
for
music
said
captain
hackstaff
but
it
appears
to
me
that
the
tune
that
man
was
whistling
the
night
we
lost
the
man
overboard
i
do
know
why
it
has
stuck
in
my
head
and
of
course
all
nonsense
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
heard
it
all
the
rest
of
the
trip
i
did
say
anything
to
that
but
i
wondered
just
how
much
the
old
man
had
understood
then
we
turned
in
and
i
slept
ten
hours
without
opening
my
eyes
i
stuck
to
the
after
that
as
long
as
i
could
stand
a
but
that
night
when
we
lay
in
havana
was
the
last
time
i
ever
heard
nancy
lee
on
board
of
her
the
spare
hand
had
gone
ashore
with
the
rest
and
he
never
came
back
and
he
took
his
tune
with
him
but
all
those
things
are
just
as
clear
in
my
memory
as
if
they
had
happened
yesterday
after
that
i
was
in
deep
water
for
a
year
or
more
and
after
i
came
home
i
got
my
certificate
and
what
with
having
friends
and
having
saved
a
little
money
and
having
had
a
small
legacy
from
an
uncle
in
norway
i
got
the
command
of
a
coastwise
vessel
with
a
small
share
in
her
i
was
at
home
three
weeks
before
going
to
sea
and
jack
benton
saw
my
name
in
the
local
papers
and
wrote
to
me
he
said
that
he
had
left
the
sea
and
was
trying
farming
and
he
was
going
to
be
married
and
he
asked
if
i
would
come
over
for
that
for
it
was
more
than
forty
minutes
by
train
and
he
and
mamie
would
be
proud
to
have
me
at
the
wedding
i
remembered
how
i
had
heard
one
brother
ask
the
other
whether
mamie
knew
that
meant
whether
she
knew
he
wanted
to
marry
her
i
suppose
she
had
taken
her
time
about
it
for
it
was
pretty
nearly
three
years
then
since
we
had
lost
jim
benton
overboard
i
had
nothing
particular
to
do
while
we
were
getting
ready
for
sea
nothing
to
prevent
me
from
going
over
for
a
day
i
mean
and
i
thought
i
like
to
see
jack
benton
and
have
a
look
at
the
girl
he
was
going
to
marry
i
wondered
whether
he
had
grown
cheerful
again
and
had
got
rid
of
that
drawn
look
he
had
when
he
told
me
it
was
his
fault
how
could
it
have
been
his
fault
anyhow
so
i
wrote
to
jack
that
i
would
come
down
and
see
him
married
and
when
the
day
came
i
took
the
train
and
got
there
about
ten
in
the
morning
i
wish
i
had
jack
met
me
at
the
station
and
he
told
me
that
the
wedding
was
to
be
late
in
the
afternoon
and
that
they
were
going
off
on
any
silly
wedding
trip
he
and
mamie
but
were
just
going
to
walk
home
from
her
mother
house
to
his
cottage
that
was
good
enough
for
him
he
said
i
looked
at
him
hard
for
a
minute
after
we
met
when
we
had
parted
i
had
a
sort
of
idea
that
he
might
take
to
drink
but
he
had
he
looked
very
respectable
and
in
his
black
coat
and
high
city
collar
but
he
was
thinner
and
bonier
than
when
i
had
known
him
and
there
were
lines
in
his
face
and
i
thought
his
eyes
had
a
queer
look
in
them
half
shifty
half
scared
he
need
have
been
afraid
of
me
for
i
did
mean
to
talk
to
his
bride
about
the
he
took
me
to
his
cottage
first
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
proud
of
it
it
was
above
a
cable
length
from
mark
but
the
tide
was
running
out
and
there
was
already
a
broad
stretch
of
hard
wet
sand
on
the
other
side
of
the
beach
road
jack
bit
of
land
ran
back
behind
the
cottage
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
he
said
that
some
of
the
trees
we
saw
were
his
the
fences
were
neat
and
well
kept
and
there
was
a
barn
a
little
way
from
the
cottage
and
i
saw
some
cattle
in
the
meadows
but
it
did
look
to
me
to
be
much
of
a
farm
and
i
thought
that
before
long
jack
would
have
to
leave
his
wife
to
take
care
of
it
and
go
to
sea
again
but
i
said
it
was
a
nice
farm
so
as
to
seem
pleasant
and
as
i
do
know
much
about
these
things
i
daresay
it
was
all
the
same
i
never
saw
it
but
that
once
jack
told
me
that
he
and
his
brother
had
been
born
in
the
cottage
and
that
when
their
father
and
mother
died
they
leased
the
land
to
father
but
had
kept
the
cottage
to
live
in
when
they
came
home
from
sea
for
a
spell
it
was
as
neat
a
little
place
as
you
would
care
to
see
the
floors
as
clean
as
the
decks
of
a
yacht
and
the
paint
as
fresh
as
a
jack
always
was
a
good
painter
there
was
a
nice
parlour
on
the
ground
floor
and
jack
had
papered
it
and
had
hung
the
walls
with
photographs
of
ships
and
foreign
ports
and
with
things
he
had
brought
home
from
his
voyages
a
boomerang
a
south
sea
club
japanese
straw
hats
and
a
gibraltar
fan
with
a
on
it
and
all
that
sort
of
gear
it
looked
to
me
as
if
miss
mamie
had
taken
a
hand
in
arranging
it
there
was
a
polished
iron
franklin
stove
set
into
the
old
fireplace
and
a
red
from
alexandria
embroidered
with
those
outlandish
egyptian
letters
it
was
all
as
bright
and
homelike
as
possible
and
he
showed
me
everything
and
was
proud
of
everything
and
i
liked
him
the
better
for
it
but
i
wished
that
his
voice
would
sound
more
cheerful
as
it
did
when
we
first
sailed
in
the
and
that
the
drawn
look
would
go
out
of
his
face
for
a
minute
jack
showed
me
everything
and
took
me
upstairs
and
it
was
all
the
same
bright
and
fresh
and
ready
for
the
bride
but
on
the
upper
landing
there
was
a
door
that
jack
did
open
when
we
came
out
of
the
bedroom
i
noticed
that
it
was
ajar
and
jack
shut
it
quickly
and
turned
the
key
that
lock
no
good
he
said
half
to
himself
the
door
is
always
open
i
did
pay
much
attention
to
what
he
said
but
as
we
went
down
the
short
stairs
freshly
painted
and
varnished
so
that
i
was
almost
afraid
to
step
on
them
he
spoke
again
that
was
his
room
sir
i
have
made
a
sort
of
of
it
you
may
be
wanting
it
in
a
year
or
so
i
said
wishing
to
be
pleasant
i
guess
we
wo
use
his
room
for
that
jack
answered
in
a
low
voice
then
he
offered
me
a
cigar
from
a
fresh
box
in
the
parlour
and
he
took
one
and
we
lit
them
and
went
out
and
as
we
opened
the
front
door
there
was
mamie
brewster
standing
in
the
path
as
if
she
were
waiting
for
us
she
was
a
girl
and
i
did
wonder
that
jack
had
been
willing
to
wait
three
years
for
her
i
could
see
that
she
had
been
brought
up
on
and
cold
storage
but
had
grown
into
a
woman
by
the
she
had
brown
eyes
and
fine
brown
hair
and
a
good
figure
this
is
captain
torkeldsen
said
jack
this
is
miss
brewster
captain
and
she
is
glad
to
see
you
well
i
am
said
miss
mamie
for
jack
has
often
talked
to
us
about
you
captain
she
put
out
her
hand
and
took
mine
and
shook
it
heartily
and
i
suppose
i
said
something
but
i
know
i
did
say
much
the
front
door
of
the
cottage
looked
toward
the
sea
and
there
was
a
straight
path
leading
to
the
gate
on
the
beach
road
there
was
another
path
from
the
steps
of
the
cottage
that
turned
to
the
right
broad
enough
for
two
people
to
walk
easily
and
it
led
straight
across
the
fields
through
gates
to
a
larger
house
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
that
was
where
mamie
mother
lived
and
the
wedding
was
to
be
there
jack
asked
me
whether
i
would
like
to
look
round
the
farm
before
dinner
but
i
told
him
i
did
know
much
about
farms
then
he
said
he
just
wanted
to
look
round
himself
a
bit
as
he
might
have
much
more
chance
that
day
and
he
smiled
and
mamie
laughed
show
the
captain
the
way
to
the
house
mamie
he
said
i
be
along
in
a
minute
so
mamie
and
i
began
to
walk
along
the
path
and
jack
went
up
toward
the
barn
it
was
sweet
of
you
to
come
captain
miss
mamie
began
for
i
have
always
wanted
to
see
you
yes
i
said
expecting
something
more
you
see
i
always
knew
them
both
she
went
on
they
used
to
take
me
out
in
a
dory
to
catch
codfish
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
i
liked
them
both
she
added
thoughtfully
jack
does
care
to
talk
about
his
brother
now
that
natural
but
you
wo
mind
telling
me
how
it
happened
will
you
i
should
so
much
like
to
know
well
i
told
her
about
the
voyage
and
what
happened
that
night
when
we
fell
in
with
a
gale
of
wind
and
that
it
had
been
anybody
fault
for
i
was
going
to
admit
that
it
was
my
old
captain
if
it
was
but
i
did
tell
her
anything
about
what
happened
afterwards
as
she
speak
i
just
went
on
talking
about
the
two
brothers
and
how
like
they
had
been
and
how
when
poor
jim
was
drowned
and
jack
was
left
i
took
jack
for
him
i
told
her
that
none
of
us
had
ever
been
sure
which
was
which
i
was
always
sure
myself
she
said
unless
they
were
together
leastways
not
for
a
day
or
two
after
they
came
home
from
sea
and
now
it
seems
to
me
that
jack
is
more
like
poor
jim
as
i
remember
him
than
he
ever
was
for
jim
was
always
more
quiet
as
if
he
were
thinking
i
told
her
i
thought
so
too
we
passed
the
gate
and
went
into
the
next
field
walking
side
by
side
then
she
turned
her
head
to
look
for
jack
but
he
was
in
sight
i
sha
forget
what
she
said
next
are
you
sure
now
she
asked
i
stood
and
she
went
on
a
step
and
then
turned
and
looked
at
me
we
must
have
looked
at
each
other
while
you
could
count
five
or
six
i
know
it
silly
she
went
on
it
silly
and
it
awful
too
and
i
have
got
no
right
to
think
it
but
sometimes
i
ca
help
it
you
see
it
was
always
jack
i
meant
to
marry
yes
i
said
stupidly
i
suppose
so
she
waited
a
minute
and
began
walking
on
slowly
before
she
went
on
again
i
am
talking
to
you
as
if
you
were
an
old
friend
captain
and
i
have
only
known
you
five
minutes
it
was
jack
i
meant
to
marry
but
now
he
is
so
like
the
other
one
when
a
woman
gets
a
wrong
idea
into
her
head
there
is
only
one
way
to
make
her
tired
of
it
and
that
is
to
agree
with
her
that
what
i
did
and
she
went
on
talking
the
same
way
for
a
little
while
and
i
kept
on
agreeing
and
agreeing
until
she
turned
round
on
me
you
know
you
do
believe
what
you
say
she
said
and
laughed
you
know
that
jack
is
jack
right
enough
and
it
jack
i
am
going
to
marry
of
course
i
said
so
for
i
did
care
whether
she
thought
me
a
weak
creature
or
not
i
was
going
to
say
a
word
that
could
interfere
with
her
happiness
and
i
did
intend
to
go
back
on
jack
benton
but
i
remembered
what
he
had
said
when
he
left
the
ship
in
havana
that
it
was
his
fault
all
the
same
miss
mamie
went
on
as
a
woman
will
without
realising
what
she
was
saying
all
the
same
i
wish
i
had
seen
it
happen
then
i
should
know
next
minute
she
knew
that
she
did
mean
that
and
was
afraid
that
i
would
think
her
heartless
and
began
to
explain
that
she
would
really
rather
have
died
herself
than
have
seen
poor
jim
go
overboard
women
have
got
much
sense
anyhow
all
the
same
i
wondered
how
she
could
marry
jack
if
she
had
a
doubt
that
he
might
be
jim
after
all
i
suppose
she
had
really
got
used
to
him
since
he
had
given
up
the
sea
and
had
stayed
ashore
and
she
cared
for
him
before
long
we
heard
jack
coming
up
behind
us
for
we
had
walked
very
slowly
to
wait
for
him
promise
not
to
tell
anybody
what
i
said
captain
said
mamie
as
girls
do
as
soon
as
they
have
told
their
secrets
anyhow
i
know
i
never
did
tell
any
one
but
you
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
talked
of
all
that
the
first
time
since
i
took
the
train
from
that
place
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
all
about
the
day
miss
mamie
introduced
me
to
her
mother
who
was
a
quiet
old
new
england
farmer
widow
and
to
her
cousins
and
relations
and
there
were
plenty
of
them
too
at
dinner
and
there
was
the
parson
besides
he
was
what
they
call
a
baptist
in
those
parts
with
a
long
shaven
upper
lip
and
a
whacking
appetite
and
a
sort
of
superior
look
as
if
he
did
expect
to
see
many
of
us
hereafter
the
way
a
new
york
pilot
looks
round
and
orders
things
about
when
he
boards
an
italian
as
if
the
ship
were
up
to
much
anyway
though
it
was
his
business
to
see
that
she
did
get
aground
that
the
way
a
good
many
parsons
look
i
think
he
said
grace
as
if
he
were
ordering
the
men
to
sheet
home
the
and
get
the
helm
up
after
dinner
we
went
out
on
the
piazza
for
it
was
warm
autumn
weather
and
the
young
folks
went
off
in
pairs
along
the
beach
road
and
the
tide
had
turned
and
was
beginning
to
come
in
the
morning
had
been
clear
and
fine
but
by
four
it
began
to
look
like
a
fog
and
the
damp
came
up
out
of
the
sea
and
settled
on
everything
jack
said
he
go
down
to
his
cottage
and
have
a
last
look
for
the
wedding
was
to
be
at
five
or
soon
after
and
he
wanted
to
light
the
lights
so
as
to
have
things
look
cheerful
i
will
just
take
a
last
look
he
said
again
as
we
reached
the
house
we
went
in
and
he
offered
me
another
cigar
and
i
lit
it
and
sat
down
in
the
parlour
i
could
hear
him
moving
about
first
in
the
kitchen
and
then
upstairs
and
then
i
heard
him
in
the
kitchen
again
and
then
before
i
knew
anything
i
heard
somebody
moving
upstairs
again
i
knew
he
could
have
got
up
those
stairs
as
quick
as
that
he
came
into
the
parlour
and
he
took
a
cigar
himself
and
while
he
was
lighting
it
i
heard
those
steps
again
overhead
his
hand
shook
and
he
dropped
the
match
have
you
got
in
somebody
to
help
i
asked
no
jack
answered
sharply
and
struck
another
match
there
somebody
upstairs
jack
i
said
do
you
hear
footsteps
it
the
wind
captain
jack
answered
but
i
could
see
he
was
trembling
that
is
any
wind
jack
i
said
it
still
and
foggy
i
sure
there
somebody
upstairs
if
you
are
so
sure
of
it
you
better
go
and
see
for
yourself
captain
jack
answered
almost
angrily
he
was
angry
because
he
was
frightened
i
left
him
before
the
fireplace
and
went
upstairs
there
was
no
power
on
earth
that
could
make
me
believe
i
had
heard
a
man
footsteps
overhead
i
knew
there
was
somebody
there
but
there
was
i
went
into
the
bedroom
and
it
was
all
quiet
and
the
evening
light
was
streaming
in
reddish
through
the
foggy
air
and
i
went
out
on
the
landing
and
looked
in
the
little
back
room
that
was
meant
for
a
or
a
child
and
as
i
came
back
again
i
saw
that
the
door
of
the
other
room
was
wide
open
though
i
knew
jack
had
locked
it
he
had
said
the
lock
was
no
good
i
looked
in
it
was
a
room
as
big
as
the
bedroom
but
almost
dark
for
it
had
shutters
and
they
were
closed
there
was
a
musty
smell
as
of
old
gear
and
i
could
make
out
that
the
floor
was
littered
with
and
that
there
were
oilskins
and
such
stuff
piled
on
the
bed
but
i
still
believed
that
there
was
somebody
upstairs
and
i
went
in
and
struck
a
match
and
looked
round
i
could
see
the
four
walls
and
the
shabby
old
paper
an
iron
bed
and
a
cracked
and
the
stuff
on
the
floor
but
there
was
nobody
there
so
i
put
out
the
match
and
came
out
and
shut
the
door
and
turned
the
key
now
what
i
am
telling
you
is
the
truth
when
i
had
turned
the
key
i
heard
footsteps
walking
away
from
the
door
inside
the
room
then
i
felt
queer
for
a
minute
and
when
i
went
downstairs
i
looked
behind
me
as
the
men
at
the
wheel
used
to
look
behind
them
on
board
the
jack
was
already
outside
on
the
steps
smoking
i
have
an
idea
that
he
did
like
to
stay
inside
alone
well
he
asked
trying
to
seem
careless
i
did
find
anybody
i
answered
but
i
heard
somebody
moving
about
i
told
you
it
was
the
wind
said
jack
contemptuously
i
ought
to
know
for
i
live
here
and
i
hear
it
often
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
to
that
so
we
began
to
walk
down
toward
the
beach
jack
said
there
was
any
hurry
as
it
would
take
miss
mamie
some
time
to
dress
for
the
wedding
so
we
strolled
along
and
the
sun
was
setting
through
the
fog
and
the
tide
was
coming
in
i
knew
the
moon
was
full
and
that
when
she
rose
the
fog
would
roll
away
from
the
land
as
it
does
sometimes
i
felt
that
jack
did
like
my
having
heard
that
noise
so
i
talked
of
other
things
and
asked
him
about
his
prospects
and
before
long
we
were
chatting
as
pleasantly
as
possible
i
have
been
at
many
weddings
in
my
life
and
i
do
suppose
you
have
but
that
one
seemed
to
me
to
be
all
right
until
it
was
pretty
near
over
and
then
i
do
know
whether
it
was
part
of
the
ceremony
or
not
but
jack
put
out
his
hand
and
took
mamie
and
held
it
a
minute
and
looked
at
her
while
the
parson
was
still
speaking
mamie
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
screamed
it
was
a
loud
scream
but
just
a
sort
of
stifled
little
shriek
as
if
she
were
half
frightened
to
death
and
the
parson
stopped
and
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
and
the
family
gathered
round
your
hand
like
ice
said
mamie
to
jack
and
it
all
wet
she
kept
looking
at
it
as
she
got
hold
of
herself
again
it
do
feel
cold
to
me
said
jack
and
he
held
the
back
of
his
hand
against
his
cheek
try
it
again
mamie
held
out
hers
and
touched
the
back
of
his
hand
timidly
at
first
and
then
took
hold
of
it
why
that
funny
she
said
she
been
as
nervous
as
a
witch
all
day
said
brewster
severely
it
is
natural
said
the
parson
that
young
benton
should
experience
a
little
agitation
at
such
a
moment
most
of
the
bride
relations
lived
at
a
distance
and
were
busy
people
so
it
had
been
arranged
that
the
dinner
we
had
in
the
middle
of
the
day
was
to
take
the
place
of
a
dinner
afterwards
and
that
we
should
just
have
a
bite
after
the
wedding
was
over
and
then
that
everybody
should
go
home
and
the
young
couple
would
walk
down
to
the
cottage
by
themselves
when
i
looked
out
i
could
see
the
light
burning
brightly
in
jack
cottage
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
i
said
i
did
think
i
could
get
any
train
to
take
me
back
before
nine
but
brewster
begged
me
to
stay
until
it
was
time
as
she
said
her
daughter
would
want
to
take
off
her
wedding
dress
before
she
went
home
for
she
had
put
on
something
white
with
a
wreath
that
was
very
pretty
and
she
walk
home
like
that
could
she
so
when
we
had
all
had
a
little
supper
the
party
began
to
break
up
and
when
they
were
all
gone
brewster
and
mamie
went
upstairs
and
jack
and
i
went
out
on
the
piazza
to
have
a
smoke
as
the
old
lady
like
tobacco
in
the
house
the
full
moon
had
risen
now
and
it
was
behind
me
as
i
looked
down
toward
jack
cottage
so
that
everything
was
clear
and
white
and
there
was
only
the
light
burning
in
the
window
the
fog
had
rolled
down
to
the
water
edge
and
a
little
beyond
for
the
tide
was
high
or
nearly
and
was
lapping
up
over
the
last
reach
of
sand
within
fifty
feet
of
the
beach
road
jack
did
say
much
as
we
sat
smoking
but
he
thanked
me
for
coming
to
his
wedding
and
i
told
him
i
hoped
he
would
be
happy
and
so
i
did
i
daresay
both
of
us
were
thinking
of
those
footsteps
upstairs
just
then
and
that
the
house
would
seem
so
lonely
with
a
woman
in
it
by
and
by
we
heard
mamie
voice
talking
to
her
mother
on
the
stairs
and
in
a
minute
she
was
ready
to
go
she
had
put
on
again
the
dress
she
had
worn
in
the
morning
well
they
were
ready
to
go
now
it
was
all
very
quiet
after
the
excitement
and
i
knew
they
would
like
to
walk
down
that
path
alone
now
that
they
were
man
and
wife
at
last
i
bade
them
although
jack
made
a
show
of
pressing
me
to
go
with
them
by
the
path
as
far
as
the
cottage
instead
of
going
to
the
station
by
the
beach
road
it
was
all
very
quiet
and
it
seemed
to
me
a
sensible
way
of
getting
married
and
when
mamie
kissed
her
mother
i
just
looked
the
other
way
and
knocked
my
ashes
over
the
rail
of
the
piazza
so
they
started
down
the
straight
path
to
jack
cottage
and
i
waited
a
minute
with
brewster
looking
after
them
before
taking
my
hat
to
go
they
walked
side
by
side
a
little
shyly
at
first
and
then
i
saw
jack
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
as
i
looked
he
was
on
her
left
and
i
saw
the
outline
of
the
two
figures
very
distinctly
against
the
moonlight
on
the
path
and
the
shadow
on
mamie
right
was
broad
and
black
as
ink
and
it
moved
along
lengthening
and
shortening
with
the
unevenness
of
the
ground
beside
the
path
i
thanked
brewster
and
bade
her
and
though
she
was
a
hard
new
england
woman
her
voice
trembled
a
little
as
she
answered
but
being
a
sensible
person
she
went
in
and
shut
the
door
behind
her
as
i
stepped
out
on
the
path
i
looked
after
the
couple
in
the
distance
a
last
time
meaning
to
go
down
to
the
road
so
as
not
to
overtake
them
but
when
i
had
made
a
few
steps
i
stopped
and
looked
again
for
i
knew
i
had
seen
something
queer
though
i
had
only
realised
it
afterwards
i
looked
again
and
it
was
plain
enough
now
and
i
stood
staring
at
what
i
saw
mamie
was
walking
between
two
men
the
second
man
was
just
the
same
height
as
jack
both
being
about
a
half
a
head
taller
than
she
jack
on
her
left
in
his
black
and
round
hat
and
the
other
man
on
her
right
well
he
was
a
in
wet
oilskins
i
could
see
the
moonlight
shining
on
the
water
that
ran
down
him
and
on
the
little
puddle
that
had
settled
where
the
flap
of
his
was
turned
up
behind
and
one
of
his
wet
shiny
arms
was
round
waist
just
above
jack
i
was
fast
to
the
spot
where
i
stood
and
for
a
minute
i
thought
i
was
crazy
we
had
nothing
but
some
cider
for
dinner
and
tea
in
the
evening
otherwise
i
have
thought
something
had
got
into
my
head
though
i
was
never
drunk
in
my
life
it
was
more
like
a
bad
dream
after
that
i
was
glad
brewster
had
gone
in
as
for
me
i
could
help
following
the
three
in
a
sort
of
wonder
to
see
what
would
happen
to
see
whether
the
in
his
wet
togs
would
just
melt
away
into
the
moonshine
but
he
did
i
moved
slowly
and
i
remembered
afterwards
that
i
walked
on
the
grass
instead
of
on
the
path
as
if
i
were
afraid
they
might
hear
me
coming
i
suppose
it
all
happened
in
less
than
five
minutes
after
that
but
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
have
taken
an
hour
neither
jack
nor
mamie
seemed
to
notice
the
sailor
she
did
seem
to
know
that
his
wet
arm
was
round
her
and
little
by
little
they
got
near
the
cottage
and
i
was
a
hundred
yards
from
them
when
they
reached
the
door
something
made
me
stand
still
then
perhaps
it
was
fright
for
i
saw
everything
that
happened
just
as
i
see
you
now
mamie
set
her
foot
on
the
step
to
go
up
and
as
she
went
forward
i
saw
the
sailor
slowly
lock
his
arm
in
jack
and
jack
did
move
to
go
up
then
mamie
turned
round
on
the
step
and
they
all
three
stood
that
way
for
a
second
or
two
she
cried
out
then
i
heard
a
man
cry
like
that
once
when
his
arm
was
taken
off
by
a
and
she
fell
back
in
a
heap
on
the
little
piazza
i
tried
to
jump
forward
but
i
could
move
and
i
felt
my
hair
rising
under
my
hat
the
sailor
turned
slowly
where
he
stood
and
swung
jack
round
by
the
arm
steadily
and
easily
and
began
to
walk
him
down
the
pathway
from
the
house
he
walked
him
straight
down
that
path
as
steadily
as
fate
and
all
the
time
i
saw
the
moonlight
shining
on
his
wet
oilskins
he
walked
him
through
the
gate
and
across
the
beach
road
and
out
upon
the
wet
sand
where
the
tide
was
high
then
i
got
my
breath
with
a
gulp
and
ran
for
them
across
the
grass
and
vaulted
over
the
fence
and
stumbled
across
the
road
but
when
i
felt
the
sand
under
my
feet
the
two
were
at
the
water
edge
and
when
i
reached
the
water
they
were
far
out
and
up
to
their
waists
and
i
saw
that
jack
head
had
fallen
forward
on
his
breast
and
his
free
arm
hung
limp
beside
him
while
his
dead
brother
steadily
marched
him
to
his
death
the
moonlight
was
on
the
dark
water
but
the
was
white
beyond
and
i
saw
them
against
it
and
they
went
slowly
and
steadily
down
the
water
was
up
to
their
armpits
and
then
up
to
their
shoulders
and
then
i
saw
it
rise
up
to
the
black
rim
of
jack
hat
but
they
never
wavered
and
the
two
heads
went
straight
on
straight
on
till
they
were
under
and
there
was
just
a
ripple
in
the
moonlight
where
jack
had
been
it
has
been
on
my
mind
to
tell
you
that
story
whenever
i
got
a
chance
you
have
known
me
man
and
boy
a
good
many
years
and
i
thought
i
would
like
to
hear
your
opinion
yes
that
what
i
always
thought
it
jim
that
went
overboard
it
was
jack
and
jim
just
let
him
go
when
he
might
have
saved
him
and
then
jim
passed
himself
off
for
jack
with
us
and
with
the
girl
if
that
what
happened
he
got
what
he
deserved
people
said
the
next
day
that
mamie
found
it
out
as
they
reached
the
house
and
that
her
husband
just
walked
out
into
the
sea
and
drowned
himself
and
they
would
have
blamed
me
for
not
stopping
him
if
known
that
i
was
there
but
i
never
told
what
i
had
seen
for
they
would
have
believed
me
i
just
let
them
think
i
had
come
too
late
when
i
reached
the
cottage
and
lifted
mamie
up
she
was
raving
mad
she
got
better
afterwards
but
she
was
never
right
in
her
head
again
oh
you
want
to
know
if
they
found
jack
body
i
do
know
whether
it
was
his
but
i
read
in
a
paper
at
a
southern
port
where
i
was
with
my
new
ship
that
two
dead
bodies
had
come
ashore
in
a
gale
down
east
in
pretty
bad
shape
they
were
locked
together
and
one
was
a
skeleton
in
oilskins
for
the
blood
is
the
life
we
had
dined
at
sunset
on
the
broad
roof
of
the
old
tower
because
it
was
cooler
there
during
the
great
heat
of
summer
besides
the
little
kitchen
was
built
at
one
corner
of
the
great
square
platform
which
made
it
more
convenient
than
if
the
dishes
had
to
be
carried
down
the
steep
stone
steps
broken
in
places
and
everywhere
worn
with
age
the
tower
was
one
of
those
built
all
down
the
west
coast
of
calabria
by
the
emperor
charles
early
in
the
sixteenth
century
to
keep
off
the
barbary
pirates
when
the
unbelievers
were
allied
with
francis
against
the
emperor
and
the
church
they
have
gone
to
ruin
a
few
still
stand
intact
and
mine
is
one
of
the
largest
how
it
came
into
my
possession
ten
years
ago
and
why
i
spend
a
part
of
each
year
in
it
are
matters
which
do
not
concern
this
tale
the
tower
stands
in
one
of
the
loneliest
spots
in
southern
italy
at
the
extremity
of
a
curving
rocky
promontory
which
forms
a
small
but
safe
natural
harbour
at
the
southern
extremity
of
the
gulf
of
policastro
and
just
north
of
cape
scalea
the
birthplace
of
judas
iscariot
according
to
the
old
local
legend
the
tower
stands
alone
on
this
hooked
spur
of
the
rock
and
there
is
not
a
house
to
be
seen
within
three
miles
of
it
when
i
go
there
i
take
a
couple
of
sailors
one
of
whom
is
a
fair
cook
and
when
i
am
away
it
is
in
charge
of
a
little
being
who
was
once
a
miner
and
who
attached
himself
to
me
long
ago
my
friend
who
sometimes
visits
me
in
my
summer
solitude
is
an
artist
by
profession
a
scandinavian
by
birth
and
a
cosmopolitan
by
force
of
circumstances
we
had
dined
at
sunset
the
sunset
glow
had
reddened
and
faded
again
and
the
evening
purple
steeped
the
vast
chain
of
the
mountains
that
embrace
the
deep
gulf
to
eastward
and
rear
themselves
higher
and
higher
toward
the
south
it
was
hot
and
we
sat
at
the
landward
corner
of
the
platform
waiting
for
the
night
breeze
to
come
down
from
the
lower
hills
the
colour
sank
out
of
the
air
there
was
a
little
interval
of
twilight
and
a
lamp
sent
a
yellow
streak
from
the
open
door
of
the
kitchen
where
the
men
were
getting
their
supper
then
the
moon
rose
suddenly
above
the
crest
of
the
promontory
flooding
the
platform
and
lighting
up
every
little
spur
of
rock
and
knoll
of
grass
below
us
down
to
the
edge
of
the
motionless
water
my
friend
lighted
his
pipe
and
sat
looking
at
a
spot
on
the
hillside
i
knew
that
he
was
looking
at
it
and
for
a
long
time
past
i
had
wondered
whether
he
would
ever
see
anything
there
that
would
fix
his
attention
i
knew
that
spot
well
it
was
clear
that
he
was
interested
at
last
though
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
spoke
like
most
painters
he
trusts
to
his
own
eyesight
as
a
lion
trusts
his
strength
and
a
stag
his
speed
and
he
is
always
disturbed
when
he
can
not
reconcile
what
he
sees
with
what
he
believes
that
he
ought
to
see
it
strange
he
said
do
you
see
that
little
mound
just
on
this
side
of
the
boulder
yes
i
said
and
i
guessed
what
was
coming
it
looks
like
a
grave
observed
holger
very
true
it
does
look
like
a
grave
yes
continued
my
friend
his
eyes
still
fixed
on
the
spot
but
the
strange
thing
is
that
i
see
the
body
lying
on
the
top
of
it
of
course
continued
holger
turning
his
head
on
one
side
as
artists
do
it
must
be
an
effect
of
light
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
a
grave
at
all
secondly
if
it
were
the
body
would
be
inside
and
not
outside
therefore
it
an
effect
of
the
moonlight
do
you
see
it
perfectly
i
always
see
it
on
moonlight
nights
it
does
seem
to
interest
you
much
said
holger
on
the
contrary
it
does
interest
me
though
i
am
used
to
it
not
so
far
wrong
either
the
mound
is
really
a
grave
nonsense
cried
holger
incredulously
i
suppose
you
tell
me
what
i
see
lying
on
it
is
really
a
corpse
no
i
answered
it
not
i
know
because
i
have
taken
the
trouble
to
go
down
and
see
then
what
is
it
asked
holger
it
nothing
you
mean
that
it
an
effect
of
light
i
suppose
perhaps
it
is
but
the
inexplicable
part
of
the
matter
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
moon
is
rising
or
setting
or
waxing
or
waning
if
there
any
moonlight
at
all
from
east
or
west
or
overhead
so
long
as
it
shines
on
the
grave
you
can
see
the
outline
of
the
body
on
top
holger
stirred
up
his
pipe
with
the
point
of
his
knife
and
then
used
his
finger
for
a
stopper
when
the
tobacco
burned
well
he
rose
from
his
chair
if
you
do
mind
he
said
i
go
down
and
take
a
look
at
it
he
left
me
crossed
the
roof
and
disappeared
down
the
dark
steps
i
did
not
move
but
sat
looking
down
until
he
came
out
of
the
tower
below
i
heard
him
humming
an
old
danish
song
as
he
crossed
the
open
space
in
the
bright
moonlight
going
straight
to
the
mysterious
mound
when
he
was
ten
paces
from
it
holger
stopped
short
made
two
steps
forward
and
then
three
or
four
backward
and
then
stopped
again
i
know
what
that
meant
he
had
reached
the
spot
where
the
thing
ceased
to
be
visible
where
as
he
would
have
said
the
effect
of
light
changed
then
he
went
on
till
he
reached
the
mound
and
stood
upon
it
i
could
see
the
thing
still
but
it
was
no
longer
lying
down
it
was
on
its
knees
now
winding
its
white
arms
round
holger
body
and
looking
up
into
his
face
a
cool
breeze
stirred
my
hair
at
that
moment
as
the
night
wind
began
to
come
down
from
the
hills
but
it
felt
like
a
breath
from
another
world
the
thing
seemed
to
be
trying
to
climb
to
its
feet
helping
itself
up
by
holger
body
while
he
stood
upright
quite
unconscious
of
it
and
apparently
looking
toward
the
tower
which
is
very
picturesque
when
the
moonlight
falls
upon
it
on
that
side
come
along
i
shouted
do
stay
there
all
night
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
moved
reluctantly
as
he
stepped
from
the
mound
or
else
with
difficulty
that
was
it
the
thing
arms
were
still
round
his
waist
but
its
feet
could
not
leave
the
grave
as
he
came
slowly
forward
it
was
drawn
and
lengthened
like
a
wreath
of
mist
thin
and
white
till
i
saw
distinctly
that
holger
shook
himself
as
a
man
does
who
feels
a
chill
at
the
same
instant
a
little
wail
of
pain
came
to
me
on
the
breeze
it
might
have
been
the
cry
of
the
small
owl
that
lives
among
the
rocks
and
the
misty
presence
floated
swiftly
back
from
holger
advancing
figure
and
lay
once
more
at
its
length
upon
the
mound
again
i
felt
the
cool
breeze
in
my
hair
and
this
time
an
icy
thrill
of
dread
ran
down
my
spine
i
remembered
very
well
that
i
had
once
gone
down
there
alone
in
the
moonlight
that
presently
being
near
i
had
seen
nothing
that
like
holger
i
had
gone
and
had
stood
upon
the
mound
and
i
remembered
how
when
i
came
back
sure
that
there
was
nothing
there
i
had
felt
the
sudden
conviction
that
there
was
something
after
all
if
i
would
only
look
behind
me
i
remembered
the
strong
temptation
to
look
back
a
temptation
i
had
resisted
as
unworthy
of
a
man
of
sense
until
to
get
rid
of
it
i
had
shaken
myself
just
as
holger
did
and
now
i
knew
that
those
white
misty
arms
had
been
round
me
too
i
knew
it
in
a
flash
and
i
shuddered
as
i
remembered
that
i
had
heard
the
night
owl
then
too
but
it
had
not
been
the
night
owl
it
was
the
cry
of
the
thing
i
refilled
my
pipe
and
poured
out
a
cup
of
strong
southern
wine
in
less
than
a
minute
holger
was
seated
beside
me
again
of
course
there
nothing
there
he
said
but
it
creepy
all
the
same
do
you
know
when
i
was
coming
back
i
was
so
sure
that
there
was
something
behind
me
that
i
wanted
to
turn
round
and
look
it
was
an
effort
not
to
he
laughed
a
little
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
and
poured
himself
out
some
wine
for
a
while
neither
of
us
spoke
and
the
moon
rose
higher
and
we
both
looked
at
the
thing
that
lay
on
the
mound
you
might
make
a
story
about
that
said
holger
after
a
long
time
there
is
one
i
answered
if
you
not
sleepy
i
tell
it
to
you
go
ahead
said
holger
who
likes
stories
old
alario
was
dying
up
there
in
the
village
behind
the
hill
you
remember
him
i
have
no
doubt
they
say
that
he
made
his
money
by
selling
sham
jewellery
in
south
america
and
escaped
with
his
gains
when
he
was
found
out
like
all
those
fellows
if
they
bring
anything
back
with
them
he
at
once
set
to
work
to
enlarge
his
house
and
as
there
are
no
masons
here
he
sent
all
the
way
to
paola
for
two
workmen
they
were
a
pair
of
scoundrels
a
neapolitan
who
had
lost
one
eye
and
a
sicilian
with
an
old
scar
half
an
inch
deep
across
his
left
cheek
i
often
saw
them
for
on
sundays
they
used
to
come
down
here
and
fish
off
the
rocks
when
alario
caught
the
fever
that
killed
him
the
masons
were
still
at
work
as
he
had
agreed
that
part
of
their
pay
should
be
their
board
and
lodging
he
made
them
sleep
in
the
house
his
wife
was
dead
and
he
had
an
only
son
called
angelo
who
was
a
much
better
sort
than
himself
angelo
was
to
marry
the
daughter
of
the
richest
man
in
the
village
and
strange
to
say
though
the
marriage
was
arranged
by
their
parents
the
young
people
were
said
to
be
in
love
with
each
other
for
that
matter
the
whole
village
was
in
love
with
angelo
and
among
the
rest
a
wild
creature
called
cristina
who
was
more
like
a
gipsy
than
any
girl
i
ever
saw
about
here
she
had
very
red
lips
and
very
black
eyes
she
was
built
like
a
greyhound
and
had
the
tongue
of
the
devil
but
angelo
did
not
care
a
straw
for
her
he
was
rather
a
fellow
quite
different
from
his
old
scoundrel
of
a
father
and
under
what
i
should
call
normal
circumstances
i
really
believe
that
he
would
never
have
looked
at
any
girl
except
the
nice
plump
little
creature
with
a
fat
dowry
whom
his
father
meant
him
to
marry
but
things
turned
up
which
were
neither
normal
nor
natural
on
the
other
hand
a
very
handsome
young
shepherd
from
the
hills
above
maratea
was
in
love
with
cristina
who
seems
to
have
been
quite
indifferent
to
him
cristina
had
no
regular
means
of
subsistence
but
she
was
a
good
girl
and
willing
to
do
any
work
or
go
on
errands
to
any
distance
for
the
sake
of
a
loaf
of
bread
or
a
mess
of
beans
and
permission
to
sleep
under
cover
she
was
especially
glad
when
she
could
get
something
to
do
about
the
house
of
angelo
father
there
is
no
doctor
in
the
village
and
when
the
neighbours
saw
that
old
alario
was
dying
they
sent
cristina
to
scalea
to
fetch
one
that
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
if
they
had
waited
so
long
it
was
because
the
dying
miser
refused
to
allow
any
such
extravagance
while
he
was
able
to
speak
but
while
cristina
was
gone
matters
grew
rapidly
worse
the
priest
was
brought
to
the
bedside
and
when
he
had
done
what
he
could
he
gave
it
as
his
opinion
to
the
bystanders
that
the
old
man
was
dead
and
left
the
house
you
know
these
people
they
have
a
physical
horror
of
death
until
the
priest
spoke
the
room
had
been
full
of
people
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
it
was
empty
it
was
night
now
they
hurried
down
the
dark
steps
and
out
into
the
street
angelo
as
i
have
said
was
away
cristina
had
not
come
back
the
simple
who
had
nursed
the
sick
man
fled
with
the
rest
and
the
body
was
left
alone
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
earthen
oil
lamp
five
minutes
later
two
men
looked
in
cautiously
and
crept
forward
toward
the
bed
they
were
the
neapolitan
mason
and
his
sicilian
companion
they
knew
what
they
wanted
in
a
moment
they
had
dragged
from
under
the
bed
a
small
but
heavy
box
and
long
before
any
one
thought
of
coming
back
to
the
dead
man
they
had
left
the
house
and
the
village
under
cover
of
the
darkness
it
was
easy
enough
for
house
is
the
last
toward
the
gorge
which
leads
down
here
and
the
thieves
merely
went
out
by
the
back
door
got
over
the
stone
wall
and
had
nothing
to
risk
after
that
except
the
possibility
of
meeting
some
belated
countryman
which
was
very
small
indeed
since
few
of
the
people
use
that
path
they
had
a
mattock
and
shovel
and
they
made
their
way
here
without
accident
i
am
telling
you
this
story
as
it
must
have
happened
for
of
course
there
were
no
witnesses
to
this
part
of
it
the
men
brought
the
box
down
by
the
gorge
intending
to
bury
it
until
they
should
be
able
to
come
back
and
take
it
away
in
a
boat
they
must
have
been
clever
enough
to
guess
that
some
of
the
money
would
be
in
paper
notes
for
they
would
otherwise
have
buried
it
on
the
beach
in
the
wet
sand
where
it
would
have
been
much
safer
but
the
paper
would
have
rotted
if
they
had
been
obliged
to
leave
it
there
long
so
they
dug
their
hole
down
there
close
to
that
boulder
yes
just
where
the
mound
is
now
cristina
did
not
find
the
doctor
in
scalea
for
he
had
been
sent
for
from
a
place
up
the
valley
halfway
to
san
domenico
if
she
had
found
him
he
would
have
come
on
his
mule
by
the
upper
road
which
is
smoother
but
much
longer
but
cristina
took
the
short
cut
by
the
rocks
which
passes
about
fifty
feet
above
the
mound
and
goes
round
that
corner
the
men
were
digging
when
she
passed
and
she
heard
them
at
work
it
would
not
have
been
like
her
to
go
by
without
finding
out
what
the
noise
was
for
she
was
never
afraid
of
anything
in
her
life
and
besides
the
fishermen
sometimes
come
ashore
here
at
night
to
get
a
stone
for
an
anchor
or
to
gather
sticks
to
make
a
little
fire
the
night
was
dark
and
cristina
probably
came
close
to
the
two
men
before
she
could
see
what
they
were
doing
she
knew
them
of
course
and
they
knew
her
and
understood
instantly
that
they
were
in
her
power
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
for
their
safety
and
they
did
it
they
knocked
her
on
the
head
they
dug
the
hole
deep
and
they
buried
her
quickly
with
the
chest
they
must
have
understood
that
their
only
chance
of
escaping
suspicion
lay
in
getting
back
to
the
village
before
their
absence
was
noticed
for
they
returned
immediately
and
were
found
half
an
hour
later
gossiping
quietly
with
the
man
who
was
making
coffin
he
was
a
crony
of
theirs
and
had
been
working
at
the
repairs
in
the
old
man
house
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
make
out
the
only
persons
who
were
supposed
to
know
where
alario
kept
his
treasure
were
angelo
and
the
one
i
have
mentioned
angelo
was
away
it
was
the
woman
who
discovered
the
theft
it
is
easy
enough
to
understand
why
no
one
else
knew
where
the
money
was
the
old
man
kept
his
door
locked
and
the
key
in
his
pocket
when
he
was
out
and
did
not
let
the
woman
enter
to
clean
the
place
unless
he
was
there
himself
the
whole
village
knew
that
he
had
money
somewhere
however
and
the
masons
had
probably
discovered
the
whereabouts
of
the
chest
by
climbing
in
at
the
window
in
his
absence
if
the
old
man
had
not
been
delirious
until
he
lost
consciousness
he
would
have
been
in
frightful
agony
of
mind
for
his
riches
the
faithful
forgot
their
existence
only
for
a
few
moments
when
she
fled
with
the
rest
overcome
by
the
horror
of
death
twenty
minutes
had
not
passed
before
she
returned
with
the
two
hideous
old
hags
who
are
always
called
in
to
prepare
the
dead
for
burial
even
then
she
had
not
at
first
the
courage
to
go
near
the
bed
with
them
but
she
made
a
pretence
of
dropping
something
went
down
on
her
knees
as
if
to
find
it
and
looked
under
the
bedstead
the
walls
of
the
room
were
newly
whitewashed
down
to
the
floor
and
she
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
chest
was
gone
it
had
been
there
in
the
afternoon
it
had
therefore
been
stolen
in
the
short
interval
since
she
had
left
the
room
there
are
no
carabineers
stationed
in
the
village
there
is
not
so
much
as
a
municipal
watchman
for
there
is
no
municipality
there
never
was
such
a
place
i
believe
scalea
is
supposed
to
look
after
it
in
some
mysterious
way
and
it
takes
a
couple
of
hours
to
get
anybody
from
there
as
the
old
woman
had
lived
in
the
village
all
her
life
it
did
not
even
occur
to
her
to
apply
to
any
civil
authority
for
help
she
simply
set
up
a
howl
and
ran
through
the
village
in
the
dark
screaming
out
that
her
dead
master
house
had
been
robbed
many
of
the
people
looked
out
but
at
first
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
help
her
most
of
them
judging
her
by
themselves
whispered
to
each
other
that
she
had
probably
stolen
the
money
herself
the
first
man
to
move
was
the
father
of
the
girl
whom
angelo
was
to
marry
having
collected
his
household
all
of
whom
felt
a
personal
interest
in
the
wealth
which
was
to
have
come
into
the
family
he
declared
it
to
be
his
opinion
that
the
chest
had
been
stolen
by
the
two
journeyman
masons
who
lodged
in
the
house
he
headed
a
search
for
them
which
naturally
began
in
alario
house
and
ended
in
the
carpenter
workshop
where
the
thieves
were
found
discussing
a
measure
of
wine
with
the
carpenter
over
the
coffin
by
the
light
of
one
earthen
lamp
filled
with
oil
and
tallow
the
search
party
at
once
accused
the
delinquents
of
the
crime
and
threatened
to
lock
them
up
in
the
cellar
till
the
carabineers
could
be
fetched
from
scalea
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
for
one
moment
and
then
without
the
slightest
hesitation
they
put
out
the
single
light
seized
the
unfinished
coffin
between
them
and
using
it
as
a
sort
of
battering
ram
dashed
upon
their
assailants
in
the
dark
in
a
few
moments
they
were
beyond
pursuit
that
is
the
end
of
the
first
part
of
the
story
the
treasure
had
disappeared
and
as
no
trace
of
it
could
be
found
the
people
naturally
supposed
that
the
thieves
had
succeeded
in
carrying
it
off
the
old
man
was
buried
and
when
angelo
came
back
at
last
he
had
to
borrow
money
to
pay
for
the
miserable
funeral
and
had
some
difficulty
in
doing
so
he
hardly
needed
to
be
told
that
in
losing
his
inheritance
he
had
lost
his
bride
in
this
part
of
the
world
marriages
are
made
on
strictly
business
principles
and
if
the
promised
cash
is
not
forthcoming
on
the
appointed
day
the
bride
or
the
bridegroom
whose
parents
have
failed
to
produce
it
may
as
well
take
themselves
off
for
there
will
be
no
wedding
poor
angelo
knew
that
well
enough
his
father
had
been
possessed
of
hardly
any
land
and
now
that
the
hard
cash
which
he
had
brought
from
south
america
was
gone
there
was
nothing
left
but
debts
for
the
building
materials
that
were
to
have
been
used
for
enlarging
and
improving
the
old
house
angelo
was
beggared
and
the
nice
plump
little
creature
who
was
to
have
been
his
turned
up
her
nose
at
him
in
the
most
approved
fashion
as
for
cristina
it
was
several
days
before
she
was
missed
for
no
one
remembered
that
she
had
been
sent
to
scalea
for
the
doctor
who
had
never
come
she
often
disappeared
in
the
same
way
for
days
together
when
she
could
find
a
little
work
here
and
there
at
the
distant
farms
among
the
hills
but
when
she
did
not
come
back
at
all
people
began
to
wonder
and
at
last
made
up
their
minds
that
she
had
connived
with
the
masons
and
had
escaped
with
them
paused
and
emptied
my
that
sort
of
thing
could
not
happen
anywhere
else
observed
holger
filling
his
everlasting
pipe
again
it
is
wonderful
what
a
natural
charm
there
is
about
murder
and
sudden
death
in
a
romantic
country
like
this
deeds
that
would
be
simply
brutal
and
disgusting
anywhere
else
become
dramatic
and
mysterious
because
this
is
italy
and
we
are
living
in
a
genuine
tower
of
charles
built
against
genuine
barbary
pirates
there
something
in
that
i
admitted
holger
is
the
most
romantic
man
in
the
world
inside
of
himself
but
he
always
thinks
it
necessary
to
explain
why
he
feels
i
suppose
they
found
the
poor
girl
body
with
the
box
he
said
as
it
seems
to
interest
you
i
answered
i
tell
you
the
rest
of
the
story
moon
had
risen
high
by
this
time
the
outline
of
the
thing
on
the
mound
was
clearer
to
our
eyes
than
the
village
very
soon
settled
down
to
its
small
dull
life
no
one
missed
old
alario
who
had
been
away
so
much
on
his
voyages
to
south
america
that
he
had
never
been
a
familiar
figure
in
his
native
place
angelo
lived
in
the
house
and
because
he
had
no
money
to
pay
the
old
she
would
not
stay
with
him
but
once
in
a
long
time
she
would
come
and
wash
a
shirt
for
him
for
old
sake
besides
the
house
he
had
inherited
a
small
patch
of
ground
at
some
distance
from
the
village
he
tried
to
cultivate
it
but
he
had
no
heart
in
the
work
for
he
knew
he
could
never
pay
the
taxes
on
it
and
on
the
house
which
would
certainly
be
confiscated
by
the
government
or
seized
for
the
debt
of
the
building
material
which
the
man
who
had
supplied
it
refused
to
take
back
angelo
was
very
unhappy
so
long
as
his
father
had
been
alive
and
rich
every
girl
in
the
village
had
been
in
love
with
him
but
that
was
all
changed
now
it
had
been
pleasant
to
be
admired
and
courted
and
invited
to
drink
wine
by
fathers
who
had
girls
to
marry
it
was
hard
to
be
stared
at
coldly
and
sometimes
laughed
at
because
he
had
been
robbed
of
his
inheritance
he
cooked
his
miserable
meals
for
himself
and
from
being
sad
became
melancholy
and
morose
at
twilight
when
the
day
work
was
done
instead
of
hanging
about
in
the
open
space
before
the
church
with
young
fellows
of
his
own
age
he
took
to
wandering
in
lonely
places
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
till
it
was
quite
dark
then
he
slunk
home
and
went
to
bed
to
save
the
expense
of
a
light
but
in
those
lonely
twilight
hours
he
began
to
have
strange
waking
dreams
he
was
not
always
alone
for
often
when
he
sat
on
the
stump
of
a
tree
where
the
narrow
path
turns
down
the
gorge
he
was
sure
that
a
woman
came
up
noiselessly
over
the
rough
stones
as
if
her
feet
were
bare
and
she
stood
under
a
clump
of
chestnut
trees
only
half
a
dozen
yards
down
the
path
and
beckoned
to
him
without
speaking
though
she
was
in
the
shadow
he
knew
that
her
lips
were
red
and
that
when
they
parted
a
little
and
smiled
at
him
she
showed
two
small
sharp
teeth
he
knew
this
at
first
rather
than
saw
it
and
he
knew
that
it
was
cristina
and
that
she
was
dead
yet
he
was
not
afraid
he
only
wondered
whether
it
was
a
dream
for
he
thought
that
if
he
had
been
awake
he
should
have
been
frightened
besides
the
dead
woman
had
red
lips
and
that
could
only
happen
in
a
dream
whenever
he
went
near
the
gorge
after
sunset
she
was
already
there
waiting
for
him
or
else
she
very
soon
appeared
and
he
began
to
be
sure
that
she
came
a
little
nearer
to
him
every
day
at
first
he
had
only
been
sure
of
her
mouth
but
now
each
feature
grew
distinct
and
the
pale
face
looked
at
him
with
deep
and
hungry
eyes
it
was
the
eyes
that
grew
dim
little
by
little
he
came
to
know
that
some
day
the
dream
would
not
end
when
he
turned
away
to
go
home
but
would
lead
him
down
the
gorge
out
of
which
the
vision
rose
she
was
nearer
now
when
she
beckoned
to
him
her
cheeks
were
not
livid
like
those
of
the
dead
but
pale
with
starvation
with
the
furious
and
unappeased
physical
hunger
of
her
eyes
that
devoured
him
they
feasted
on
his
soul
and
cast
a
spell
over
him
and
at
last
they
were
close
to
his
own
and
held
him
he
could
not
tell
whether
her
breath
was
as
hot
as
fire
or
as
cold
as
ice
he
could
not
tell
whether
her
red
lips
burned
his
or
froze
them
or
whether
her
five
fingers
on
his
wrists
seared
scorching
scars
or
bit
his
flesh
like
frost
he
could
not
tell
whether
he
was
awake
or
asleep
whether
she
was
alive
or
dead
but
he
knew
that
she
loved
him
she
alone
of
all
creatures
earthly
or
unearthly
and
her
spell
had
power
over
him
when
the
moon
rose
high
that
night
the
shadow
of
that
thing
was
not
alone
down
there
upon
the
mound
angelo
awoke
in
the
cool
dawn
drenched
with
dew
and
chilled
through
flesh
and
blood
and
bone
he
opened
his
eyes
to
the
faint
grey
light
and
saw
the
stars
still
shining
overhead
he
was
very
weak
and
his
heart
was
beating
so
slowly
that
he
was
almost
like
a
man
fainting
slowly
he
turned
his
head
on
the
mound
as
on
a
pillow
but
the
other
face
was
not
there
fear
seized
him
suddenly
a
fear
unspeakable
and
unknown
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
fled
up
the
gorge
and
he
never
looked
behind
him
until
he
reached
the
door
of
the
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
drearily
he
went
to
his
work
that
day
and
wearily
the
hours
dragged
themselves
after
the
sun
till
at
last
he
touched
the
sea
and
sank
and
the
great
sharp
hills
above
maratea
turned
purple
against
the
eastern
sky
angelo
shouldered
his
heavy
hoe
and
left
the
field
he
felt
less
tired
now
than
in
the
morning
when
he
had
begun
to
work
but
he
promised
himself
that
he
would
go
home
without
lingering
by
the
gorge
and
eat
the
best
supper
he
could
get
himself
and
sleep
all
night
in
his
bed
like
a
christian
man
not
again
would
he
be
tempted
down
the
narrow
way
by
a
shadow
with
red
lips
and
icy
breath
not
again
would
he
dream
that
dream
of
terror
and
delight
he
was
near
the
village
now
it
was
half
an
hour
since
the
sun
had
set
and
the
cracked
church
bell
sent
little
discordant
echoes
across
the
rocks
and
ravines
to
tell
all
good
people
that
the
day
was
done
angelo
stood
still
a
moment
where
the
path
forked
where
it
led
toward
the
village
on
the
left
and
down
to
the
gorge
on
the
right
where
a
clump
of
chestnut
trees
overhung
the
narrow
way
he
stood
still
a
minute
lifting
his
battered
hat
from
his
head
and
gazing
at
the
sea
westward
and
his
lips
moved
as
he
silently
repeated
the
familiar
evening
prayer
his
lips
moved
but
the
words
that
followed
them
in
his
brain
lost
their
meaning
and
turned
into
others
and
ended
in
a
name
that
he
spoke
aloud
cristina
with
the
name
the
tension
of
his
will
relaxed
suddenly
reality
went
out
and
the
dream
took
him
again
and
bore
him
on
swiftly
and
surely
like
a
man
walking
in
his
sleep
down
down
by
the
steep
path
in
the
gathering
darkness
and
as
she
glided
beside
him
cristina
whispered
strange
sweet
things
in
his
ear
which
somehow
if
he
had
been
awake
he
knew
that
he
could
not
quite
have
understood
but
now
they
were
the
most
wonderful
words
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
and
she
kissed
him
also
but
not
upon
his
mouth
he
felt
her
sharp
kisses
upon
his
white
throat
and
he
knew
that
her
lips
were
red
so
the
wild
dream
sped
on
through
twilight
and
darkness
and
moonrise
and
all
the
glory
of
the
night
but
in
the
chilly
dawn
he
lay
as
one
half
dead
upon
the
mound
down
there
recalling
and
not
recalling
drained
of
his
blood
yet
strangely
longing
to
give
those
red
lips
more
then
came
the
fear
the
awful
nameless
panic
the
mortal
horror
that
guards
the
confines
of
the
world
we
see
not
neither
know
of
as
we
know
of
other
things
but
which
we
feel
when
its
icy
chill
freezes
our
bones
and
stirs
our
hair
with
the
touch
of
a
ghostly
hand
once
more
angelo
sprang
from
the
mound
and
fled
up
the
gorge
in
the
breaking
day
but
his
step
was
less
sure
this
time
and
he
panted
for
breath
as
he
ran
and
when
he
came
to
the
bright
spring
of
water
that
rises
halfway
up
the
hillside
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
and
hands
and
plunged
his
whole
face
in
and
drank
as
he
had
never
drunk
before
for
it
was
the
thirst
of
the
wounded
man
who
has
lain
bleeding
all
night
long
upon
the
she
had
him
fast
now
and
he
could
not
escape
her
but
would
come
to
her
every
evening
at
dusk
until
she
had
drained
him
of
his
last
drop
of
blood
it
was
in
vain
that
when
the
day
was
done
he
tried
to
take
another
turning
and
to
go
home
by
a
path
that
did
not
lead
near
the
gorge
it
was
in
vain
that
he
made
promises
to
himself
each
morning
at
dawn
when
he
climbed
the
lonely
way
up
from
the
shore
to
the
village
it
was
all
in
vain
for
when
the
sun
sank
burning
into
the
sea
and
the
coolness
of
the
evening
stole
out
as
from
a
to
delight
the
weary
world
his
feet
turned
toward
the
old
way
and
she
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
shadow
under
the
chestnut
trees
and
then
all
happened
as
before
and
she
fell
to
kissing
his
white
throat
even
as
she
flitted
lightly
down
the
way
winding
one
arm
about
him
and
as
his
blood
failed
she
grew
more
hungry
and
more
thirsty
every
day
and
every
day
when
he
awoke
in
the
early
dawn
it
was
harder
to
rouse
himself
to
the
effort
of
climbing
the
steep
path
to
the
village
and
when
he
went
to
his
work
his
feet
dragged
painfully
and
there
was
hardly
strength
in
his
arms
to
wield
the
heavy
hoe
he
scarcely
spoke
to
any
one
now
but
the
people
said
he
was
consuming
himself
for
love
of
the
girl
he
was
to
have
married
when
he
lost
his
inheritance
and
they
laughed
heartily
at
the
thought
for
this
is
not
a
very
romantic
country
at
this
time
antonio
the
man
who
stays
here
to
look
after
the
tower
returned
from
a
visit
to
his
people
who
live
near
salerno
he
had
been
away
all
the
time
since
before
alario
death
and
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
he
has
told
me
that
he
came
back
late
in
the
afternoon
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
tower
to
eat
and
sleep
for
he
was
very
tired
it
was
past
midnight
when
he
awoke
and
when
he
looked
out
the
waning
moon
was
rising
over
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
he
looked
out
toward
the
mound
and
he
saw
something
and
he
did
not
sleep
again
that
night
when
he
went
out
again
in
the
morning
it
was
broad
daylight
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
on
the
mound
but
loose
stones
and
driven
sand
yet
he
did
not
go
very
near
it
he
went
straight
up
the
path
to
the
village
and
directly
to
the
house
of
the
old
priest
i
have
seen
an
evil
thing
this
night
he
said
i
have
seen
how
the
dead
drink
the
blood
of
the
living
and
the
blood
is
the
life
tell
me
what
you
have
seen
said
the
priest
in
reply
antonio
told
him
everything
he
had
seen
you
must
bring
your
book
and
your
holy
water
he
added
i
will
be
here
before
sunset
to
go
down
with
you
and
if
it
pleases
your
reverence
to
sup
with
me
while
we
wait
i
will
make
ready
i
will
come
the
priest
answered
for
i
have
read
in
old
books
of
these
strange
beings
which
are
neither
quick
nor
dead
and
which
lie
ever
fresh
in
their
graves
stealing
out
in
the
dusk
to
taste
life
and
blood
antonio
can
not
read
but
he
was
glad
to
see
that
the
priest
understood
the
business
for
of
course
the
books
must
have
instructed
him
as
to
the
best
means
of
quieting
the
thing
for
ever
so
antonio
went
away
to
his
work
which
consists
largely
in
sitting
on
the
shady
side
of
the
tower
when
he
is
not
perched
upon
a
rock
with
a
catching
nothing
but
on
that
day
he
went
twice
to
look
at
the
mound
in
the
bright
sunlight
and
he
searched
round
and
round
it
for
some
hole
through
which
the
being
might
get
in
and
out
but
he
found
none
when
the
sun
began
to
sink
and
the
air
was
cooler
in
the
shadows
he
went
up
to
fetch
the
old
priest
carrying
a
little
wicker
basket
with
him
and
in
this
they
placed
a
bottle
of
holy
water
and
the
basin
and
sprinkler
and
the
stole
which
the
priest
would
need
and
they
came
down
and
waited
in
the
door
of
the
tower
till
it
should
be
dark
but
while
the
light
still
lingered
very
grey
and
faint
they
saw
something
moving
just
there
two
figures
a
man
that
walked
and
a
woman
that
flitted
beside
him
and
while
her
head
lay
on
his
shoulder
she
kissed
his
throat
the
priest
has
told
me
that
too
and
that
his
teeth
chattered
and
he
grasped
antonio
arm
the
vision
passed
and
disappeared
into
the
shadow
then
antonio
got
the
leathern
flask
of
strong
liquor
which
he
kept
for
great
occasions
and
poured
such
a
draught
as
made
the
old
man
feel
almost
young
again
and
he
got
the
lantern
and
his
pick
and
shovel
and
gave
the
priest
his
stole
to
put
on
and
the
holy
water
to
carry
and
they
went
out
together
toward
the
spot
where
the
work
was
to
be
done
antonio
says
that
in
spite
of
the
rum
his
own
knees
shook
together
and
the
priest
stumbled
over
his
latin
for
when
they
were
yet
a
few
yards
from
the
mound
the
flickering
light
of
the
lantern
fell
upon
angelo
white
face
unconscious
as
if
in
sleep
and
on
his
upturned
throat
over
which
a
very
thin
red
line
of
blood
trickled
down
into
his
collar
and
the
flickering
light
of
the
lantern
played
upon
another
face
that
looked
up
from
the
feast
upon
two
deep
dead
eyes
that
saw
in
spite
of
death
upon
parted
lips
redder
than
life
itself
upon
two
gleaming
teeth
on
which
glistened
a
rosy
drop
then
the
priest
good
old
man
shut
his
eyes
tight
and
showered
holy
water
before
him
and
his
cracked
voice
rose
almost
to
a
scream
and
then
antonio
who
is
no
coward
after
all
raised
his
pick
in
one
hand
and
the
lantern
in
the
other
as
he
sprang
forward
not
knowing
what
the
end
should
be
and
then
he
swears
that
he
heard
a
woman
cry
and
the
thing
was
gone
and
angelo
lay
alone
on
the
mound
unconscious
with
the
red
line
on
his
throat
and
the
beads
of
deathly
sweat
on
his
cold
forehead
they
lifted
him
as
he
was
and
laid
him
on
the
ground
close
by
then
antonio
went
to
work
and
the
priest
helped
him
though
he
was
old
and
could
not
do
much
and
they
dug
deep
and
at
last
antonio
standing
in
the
grave
stooped
down
with
his
lantern
to
see
what
he
might
see
his
hair
used
to
be
dark
brown
with
grizzled
streaks
about
the
temples
in
less
than
a
month
from
that
day
he
was
as
grey
as
a
badger
he
was
a
miner
when
he
was
young
and
most
of
these
fellows
have
seen
ugly
sights
now
and
then
when
accidents
have
happened
but
he
had
never
seen
what
he
saw
that
night
that
thing
which
is
neither
alive
nor
dead
that
thing
that
will
abide
neither
above
ground
nor
in
the
grave
antonio
had
brought
something
with
him
which
the
priest
had
not
noticed
he
had
made
it
that
afternoon
a
sharp
stake
shaped
from
a
piece
of
tough
old
driftwood
he
had
it
with
him
now
and
he
had
his
heavy
pick
and
he
had
taken
the
lantern
down
into
the
grave
i
do
think
any
power
on
earth
could
make
him
speak
of
what
happened
then
and
the
old
priest
was
too
frightened
to
look
in
he
says
he
heard
antonio
breathing
like
a
wild
beast
and
moving
as
if
he
were
fighting
with
something
almost
as
strong
as
himself
and
he
heard
an
evil
sound
also
with
blows
as
of
something
violently
driven
through
flesh
and
bone
and
then
the
most
awful
sound
of
all
a
woman
shriek
the
unearthly
scream
of
a
woman
neither
dead
nor
alive
but
buried
deep
for
many
days
and
he
the
poor
old
priest
could
only
rock
himself
as
he
knelt
there
in
the
sand
crying
aloud
his
prayers
and
exorcisms
to
drown
these
dreadful
sounds
then
suddenly
a
small
chest
was
thrown
up
and
rolled
over
against
the
old
man
knee
and
in
a
moment
more
antonio
was
beside
him
his
face
as
white
as
tallow
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
lantern
shovelling
the
sand
and
pebbles
into
the
grave
with
furious
haste
and
looking
over
the
edge
till
the
pit
was
half
full
and
the
priest
said
that
there
was
much
fresh
blood
on
antonio
hands
and
on
his
clothes
had
come
to
the
end
of
my
story
holger
finished
his
wine
and
leaned
back
in
his
so
angelo
got
his
own
again
he
said
did
he
marry
the
prim
and
plump
young
person
to
whom
he
had
been
betrothed
no
he
had
been
badly
frightened
he
went
to
south
america
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
and
that
poor
thing
body
is
there
still
i
suppose
said
holger
is
it
quite
dead
yet
i
wonder
wonder
too
but
whether
it
be
dead
or
alive
i
should
hardly
care
to
see
it
even
in
broad
daylight
antonio
is
as
grey
as
a
badger
and
he
has
never
been
quite
the
same
man
since
that
the
upper
berth
chapter
i
somebody
asked
for
the
cigars
we
had
talked
long
and
the
conversation
was
beginning
to
languish
the
tobacco
smoke
had
got
into
the
heavy
curtains
the
wine
had
got
into
those
brains
which
were
liable
to
become
heavy
and
it
was
already
perfectly
evident
that
unless
somebody
did
something
to
rouse
our
oppressed
spirits
the
meeting
would
soon
come
to
its
natural
conclusion
and
we
the
guests
would
speedily
go
home
to
bed
and
most
certainly
to
sleep
no
one
had
said
anything
very
remarkable
it
may
be
that
no
one
had
anything
very
remarkable
to
say
jones
had
given
us
every
particular
of
his
last
hunting
adventure
in
yorkshire
tompkins
of
boston
had
explained
at
elaborate
length
those
working
principles
by
the
due
and
careful
maintenance
of
which
the
atchison
topeka
and
santa
fé
railroad
not
only
extended
its
territory
increased
its
departmental
influence
and
transported
live
stock
without
starving
them
to
death
before
the
day
of
actual
delivery
but
also
had
for
years
succeeded
in
deceiving
those
passengers
who
bought
its
tickets
into
the
fallacious
belief
that
the
corporation
aforesaid
was
really
able
to
transport
human
life
without
destroying
it
signor
tombola
had
endeavoured
to
persuade
us
by
arguments
which
we
took
no
trouble
to
oppose
that
the
unity
of
his
country
in
no
way
resembled
the
average
modern
torpedo
carefully
planned
constructed
with
all
the
skill
of
the
greatest
european
arsenals
but
when
constructed
destined
to
be
directed
by
feeble
hands
into
a
region
where
it
must
undoubtedly
explode
unseen
unfeared
and
unheard
into
the
illimitable
wastes
of
political
chaos
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
into
further
details
the
conversation
had
assumed
proportions
which
would
have
bored
prometheus
on
his
rock
which
would
have
driven
tantalus
to
distraction
and
which
would
have
impelled
ixion
to
seek
relaxation
in
the
simple
but
instructive
dialogues
of
herr
ollendorff
rather
than
submit
to
the
greater
evil
of
listening
to
our
talk
we
had
sat
at
table
for
hours
we
were
bored
we
were
tired
and
nobody
showed
signs
of
moving
somebody
called
for
cigars
we
all
instinctively
looked
towards
the
speaker
brisbane
was
a
man
of
years
of
age
and
remarkable
for
those
gifts
which
chiefly
attract
the
attention
of
men
he
was
a
strong
man
the
external
proportions
of
his
figure
presented
nothing
extraordinary
to
the
common
eye
though
his
size
was
about
the
average
he
was
a
little
over
six
feet
in
height
and
moderately
broad
in
the
shoulder
he
did
not
appear
to
be
stout
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
certainly
not
thin
his
small
head
was
supported
by
a
strong
and
sinewy
neck
his
broad
muscular
hands
appeared
to
possess
a
peculiar
skill
in
breaking
walnuts
without
the
assistance
of
the
ordinary
cracker
and
seeing
him
in
profile
one
could
not
help
remarking
the
extraordinary
breadth
of
his
sleeves
and
the
unusual
thickness
of
his
chest
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
commonly
spoken
of
among
men
as
deceptive
that
is
to
say
that
though
he
looked
exceedingly
strong
he
was
in
reality
very
much
stronger
than
he
looked
of
his
features
i
need
say
little
his
head
is
small
his
hair
is
thin
his
eyes
are
blue
his
nose
is
large
he
has
a
small
moustache
and
a
square
jaw
everybody
knows
brisbane
and
when
he
asked
for
a
cigar
everybody
looked
at
him
it
is
a
very
singular
thing
said
brisbane
everybody
stopped
talking
brisbane
voice
was
not
loud
but
possessed
a
peculiar
quality
of
penetrating
general
conversation
and
cutting
it
like
a
knife
everybody
listened
brisbane
perceiving
that
he
had
attracted
their
general
attention
lit
his
cigar
with
great
equanimity
it
is
very
singular
he
continued
that
thing
about
ghosts
people
are
always
asking
whether
anybody
has
seen
a
ghost
i
have
bosh
what
you
you
do
mean
to
say
so
brisbane
well
for
a
man
of
his
intelligence
a
chorus
of
exclamations
greeted
brisbane
remarkable
statement
everybody
called
for
cigars
and
stubbs
the
butler
suddenly
appeared
from
the
depths
of
nowhere
with
a
fresh
bottle
of
dry
champagne
the
situation
was
saved
brisbane
was
going
to
tell
a
story
i
am
an
old
sailor
said
brisbane
and
as
i
have
to
cross
the
atlantic
pretty
often
i
have
my
favourites
most
men
have
their
favourites
i
have
seen
a
man
wait
in
a
broadway
bar
for
of
an
hour
for
a
particular
car
which
he
liked
i
believe
the
made
at
least
of
his
living
by
that
man
preference
i
have
a
habit
of
waiting
for
certain
ships
when
i
am
obliged
to
cross
that
it
may
be
a
prejudice
but
i
was
never
cheated
out
of
a
good
passage
but
once
in
my
life
i
remember
it
very
well
it
was
a
warm
morning
in
june
and
the
custom
house
officials
who
were
hanging
about
waiting
for
a
steamer
already
on
her
way
up
from
the
quarantine
presented
a
peculiarly
hazy
and
thoughtful
appearance
i
had
not
much
luggage
i
never
have
i
mingled
with
a
crowd
of
passengers
porters
and
officious
individuals
in
blue
coats
and
brass
buttons
who
seemed
to
spring
up
like
mushrooms
from
the
deck
of
a
moored
steamer
to
obtrude
their
unnecessary
services
upon
the
independent
passenger
i
have
often
noticed
with
a
certain
interest
the
spontaneous
evolution
of
these
fellows
they
are
not
there
when
you
arrive
five
minutes
after
the
pilot
has
called
go
ahead
they
or
at
least
their
blue
coats
and
brass
buttons
have
disappeared
from
deck
and
gangway
as
completely
as
though
they
had
been
consigned
to
that
locker
which
tradition
unanimously
ascribes
to
davy
jones
but
at
the
moment
of
starting
they
are
there
clean
shaved
blue
coated
and
ravenous
for
fees
i
hastened
on
board
the
was
one
of
my
favourite
ships
i
say
was
because
she
emphatically
no
longer
is
i
can
not
conceive
of
any
inducement
which
could
entice
me
to
make
another
voyage
in
her
yes
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
she
is
uncommonly
clean
in
the
run
aft
she
has
enough
bluffing
off
in
the
bows
to
keep
her
dry
and
the
lower
berths
are
most
of
them
double
she
has
a
lot
of
advantages
but
i
cross
in
her
again
excuse
the
digression
i
got
on
board
i
hailed
a
steward
whose
red
nose
and
redder
whiskers
were
equally
familiar
to
me
one
hundred
and
five
lower
berth
said
i
in
the
businesslike
tone
peculiar
to
men
who
think
no
more
of
crossing
the
atlantic
than
taking
a
whiskey
cocktail
at
delmonico
the
steward
took
my
portmanteau
greatcoat
and
rug
i
shall
never
forget
the
expression
of
his
face
not
that
he
turned
pale
it
is
maintained
by
the
most
eminent
divines
that
even
miracles
can
not
change
the
course
of
nature
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
he
did
not
turn
pale
but
from
his
expression
i
judged
that
he
was
either
about
to
shed
tears
to
sneeze
or
to
drop
my
portmanteau
as
the
latter
contained
two
bottles
of
particularly
fine
old
sherry
presented
to
me
for
my
voyage
by
my
old
friend
snigginson
van
pickyns
i
felt
extremely
nervous
but
the
steward
did
none
of
these
things
well
i
d
d
said
he
in
a
low
voice
and
led
the
way
i
supposed
my
hermes
as
he
led
me
to
the
lower
regions
had
had
a
little
grog
but
i
said
nothing
and
followed
him
was
on
the
port
side
well
aft
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
the
lower
berth
like
most
of
those
upon
the
was
double
there
was
plenty
of
room
there
was
the
usual
washing
apparatus
calculated
to
convey
an
idea
of
luxury
to
the
mind
of
a
north
american
indian
there
were
the
usual
inefficient
racks
of
brown
wood
in
which
it
is
more
easy
to
hang
a
umbrella
than
the
common
of
commerce
upon
the
uninviting
mattresses
were
carefully
folded
together
those
blankets
which
a
great
modern
humourist
has
aptly
compared
to
cold
buckwheat
cakes
the
question
of
towels
was
left
entirely
to
the
imagination
the
glass
decanters
were
filled
with
a
transparent
liquid
faintly
tinged
with
brown
but
from
which
an
odour
less
faint
but
not
more
pleasing
ascended
to
the
nostrils
like
a
reminiscence
of
oily
machinery
curtains
half
closed
the
upper
berth
the
hazy
june
daylight
shed
a
faint
illumination
upon
the
desolate
little
scene
ugh
how
i
hate
that
the
steward
deposited
my
traps
and
looked
at
me
as
though
he
wanted
to
get
away
probably
in
search
of
more
passengers
and
more
fees
it
is
always
a
good
plan
to
start
in
favour
with
those
functionaries
and
i
accordingly
gave
him
certain
coins
there
and
then
i
try
and
make
yer
comfortable
all
i
can
he
remarked
as
he
put
the
coins
in
his
pocket
nevertheless
there
was
a
doubtful
intonation
in
his
voice
which
surprised
me
possibly
his
scale
of
fees
had
gone
up
and
he
was
not
satisfied
but
on
the
whole
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
as
he
himself
would
have
expressed
it
he
was
the
better
for
a
glass
i
was
wrong
however
and
did
the
man
injustice
chapter
ii
nothing
especially
worthy
of
mention
occurred
during
that
day
we
left
the
pier
punctually
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
fairly
under
way
for
the
weather
was
warm
and
sultry
and
the
motion
of
the
steamer
produced
a
refreshing
breeze
everybody
knows
what
the
first
day
at
sea
is
like
people
pace
the
decks
and
stare
at
each
other
and
occasionally
meet
acquaintances
whom
they
did
not
know
to
be
on
board
there
is
the
usual
uncertainty
as
to
whether
the
food
will
be
good
bad
or
indifferent
until
the
first
two
meals
have
put
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
there
is
the
usual
uncertainty
about
the
weather
until
the
ship
is
fairly
off
fire
island
the
tables
are
crowded
at
first
and
then
suddenly
thinned
people
spring
from
their
seats
and
precipitate
themselves
towards
the
door
and
each
old
sailor
breathes
more
freely
as
his
seasick
neighbour
rushes
from
his
side
leaving
him
plenty
of
and
an
unlimited
command
over
the
mustard
one
passage
across
the
atlantic
is
very
much
like
another
and
we
who
cross
very
often
do
not
make
the
voyage
for
the
sake
of
novelty
whales
and
icebergs
are
indeed
always
objects
of
interest
but
after
all
one
whale
is
very
much
like
another
whale
and
one
rarely
sees
an
iceberg
at
close
quarters
to
the
majority
of
us
the
most
delightful
moment
of
the
day
on
board
an
ocean
steamer
is
when
we
have
taken
our
last
turn
on
deck
have
smoked
our
last
cigar
and
having
succeeded
in
tiring
ourselves
feel
at
liberty
to
turn
in
with
a
clear
conscience
on
that
first
night
of
the
voyage
i
felt
particularly
lazy
and
went
to
bed
in
rather
earlier
than
i
usually
do
as
i
turned
in
i
was
amazed
to
see
that
i
was
to
have
a
companion
a
portmanteau
very
like
my
own
lay
in
the
opposite
corner
and
in
the
upper
berth
had
been
deposited
a
neatly
folded
rug
with
a
stick
and
umbrella
i
had
hoped
to
be
alone
and
i
was
disappointed
but
i
wondered
who
my
was
to
be
and
i
determined
to
have
a
look
at
him
before
i
had
been
long
in
bed
he
entered
he
was
as
far
as
i
could
see
a
very
tall
man
very
thin
very
pale
with
sandy
hair
and
whiskers
and
colourless
grey
eyes
he
had
about
him
i
thought
an
air
of
rather
dubious
fashion
the
sort
of
man
you
might
see
in
wall
street
without
being
able
precisely
to
say
what
he
was
doing
there
the
sort
of
man
who
frequents
the
café
anglais
who
always
seems
to
be
alone
and
who
drinks
champagne
you
might
meet
him
on
a
racecourse
but
he
would
never
appear
to
be
doing
anything
there
either
a
little
a
little
odd
there
are
three
or
four
of
his
kind
on
every
ocean
steamer
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
did
not
care
to
make
his
acquaintance
and
i
went
to
sleep
saying
to
myself
that
i
would
study
his
habits
in
order
to
avoid
him
if
he
rose
early
i
would
rise
late
if
he
went
to
bed
late
i
would
go
to
bed
early
i
did
not
care
to
know
him
if
you
once
know
people
of
that
kind
they
are
always
turning
up
poor
fellow
i
need
not
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
to
so
many
decisions
about
him
for
i
never
saw
him
again
after
that
first
night
in
i
was
sleeping
soundly
when
i
was
suddenly
waked
by
a
loud
noise
to
judge
from
the
sound
my
must
have
sprung
with
a
single
leap
from
the
upper
berth
to
the
floor
i
heard
him
fumbling
with
the
latch
and
bolt
of
the
door
which
opened
almost
immediately
and
then
i
heard
his
footsteps
as
he
ran
at
full
speed
down
the
passage
leaving
the
door
open
behind
him
the
ship
was
rolling
a
little
and
i
expected
to
hear
him
stumble
or
fall
but
he
ran
as
though
he
were
running
for
his
life
the
door
swung
on
its
hinges
with
the
motion
of
the
vessel
and
the
sound
annoyed
me
i
got
up
and
shut
it
and
groped
my
way
back
to
my
berth
in
the
darkness
i
went
to
sleep
again
but
i
have
no
idea
how
long
i
slept
when
i
awoke
it
was
still
quite
dark
but
i
felt
a
disagreeable
sensation
of
cold
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
air
was
damp
you
know
the
peculiar
smell
of
a
cabin
which
has
been
wet
with
i
covered
myself
up
as
well
as
i
could
and
dozed
off
again
framing
complaints
to
be
made
the
next
day
and
selecting
the
most
powerful
epithets
in
the
language
i
could
hear
my
turn
over
in
the
upper
berth
he
had
probably
returned
while
i
was
asleep
once
i
thought
i
heard
him
groan
and
i
argued
that
he
was
that
is
particularly
unpleasant
when
one
is
below
nevertheless
i
dozed
off
and
slept
till
early
daylight
the
ship
was
rolling
heavily
much
more
than
on
the
previous
evening
and
the
grey
light
which
came
in
through
the
porthole
changed
in
tint
with
every
movement
according
as
the
angle
of
the
vessel
side
turned
the
glass
seawards
or
skywards
it
was
very
cold
unaccountably
so
for
the
month
of
june
i
turned
my
head
and
looked
at
the
porthole
and
saw
to
my
surprise
that
it
was
wide
open
and
hooked
back
i
believe
i
swore
audibly
then
i
got
up
and
shut
it
as
i
turned
back
i
glanced
at
the
upper
berth
the
curtains
were
drawn
close
together
my
companion
had
probably
felt
cold
as
well
as
i
it
struck
me
that
i
had
slept
enough
the
was
uncomfortable
though
strange
to
say
i
could
not
smell
the
dampness
which
had
annoyed
me
in
the
night
my
was
still
asleep
excellent
opportunity
for
avoiding
him
so
i
dressed
at
once
and
went
on
deck
the
day
was
warm
and
cloudy
with
an
oily
smell
on
the
water
it
was
seven
as
i
came
out
much
later
than
i
had
imagined
i
came
across
the
doctor
who
was
taking
his
first
sniff
of
the
morning
air
he
was
a
young
man
from
the
west
of
ireland
a
tremendous
fellow
with
black
hair
and
blue
eyes
already
inclined
to
be
stout
he
had
a
healthy
look
about
him
which
was
rather
attractive
fine
morning
i
remarked
by
way
of
introduction
well
said
he
eyeing
me
with
an
air
of
ready
interest
it
a
fine
morning
and
it
not
a
fine
morning
i
do
think
it
much
of
a
morning
well
no
it
is
not
so
very
fine
said
i
it
just
what
i
call
fuggly
weather
replied
the
doctor
it
was
very
cold
last
night
i
thought
i
remarked
however
when
i
looked
about
i
found
that
the
porthole
was
wide
open
i
had
not
noticed
it
when
i
went
to
bed
and
the
was
damp
too
damp
said
he
whereabouts
are
you
one
hundred
and
five
to
my
surprise
the
doctor
started
visibly
and
stared
at
me
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
oh
nothing
he
answered
only
everybody
has
complained
of
that
for
the
last
three
trips
i
shall
complain
too
i
said
it
has
certainly
not
been
properly
aired
it
is
a
shame
i
do
believe
it
can
be
helped
answered
the
doctor
i
believe
there
is
something
well
it
is
not
my
business
to
frighten
passengers
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
frightening
me
i
replied
i
can
stand
any
amount
of
damp
if
i
should
get
a
bad
cold
i
will
come
to
you
i
offered
the
doctor
a
cigar
which
he
took
and
examined
very
critically
it
is
not
so
much
the
damp
he
remarked
however
i
dare
say
you
will
get
on
very
well
have
you
a
yes
a
deuce
of
a
fellow
who
bolts
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
leaves
the
door
open
again
the
doctor
glanced
curiously
at
me
then
he
lit
the
cigar
and
looked
grave
did
he
come
back
he
asked
presently
yes
i
was
asleep
but
i
waked
up
and
heard
him
moving
then
i
felt
cold
and
went
to
sleep
again
this
morning
i
found
the
porthole
open
look
here
said
the
doctor
quietly
i
do
care
much
for
this
ship
i
do
care
a
rap
for
her
reputation
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
have
a
place
up
here
i
will
share
it
with
you
though
i
know
you
from
adam
i
was
very
much
surprised
at
the
proposition
i
could
not
imagine
why
he
should
take
such
a
sudden
interest
in
my
welfare
however
his
manner
as
he
spoke
of
the
ship
was
peculiar
you
are
very
good
doctor
i
said
but
really
i
believe
even
now
the
cabin
could
be
aired
or
cleaned
out
or
something
why
do
you
not
care
for
the
ship
we
are
not
superstitious
in
our
profession
sir
replied
the
doctor
but
the
sea
makes
people
so
i
do
want
to
prejudice
you
and
i
want
to
frighten
you
but
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
move
in
here
i
would
as
soon
see
you
overboard
he
added
earnestly
as
know
that
you
or
any
other
man
was
to
sleep
in
good
gracious
why
i
asked
just
because
on
the
three
last
trips
the
people
who
have
slept
there
actually
have
gone
overboard
he
answered
gravely
the
intelligence
was
startling
and
exceedingly
unpleasant
i
confess
i
looked
hard
at
the
doctor
to
see
whether
he
was
making
game
of
me
but
he
looked
perfectly
serious
i
thanked
him
warmly
for
his
offer
but
told
him
i
intended
to
be
the
exception
to
the
rule
by
which
every
one
who
slept
in
that
particular
went
overboard
he
did
not
say
much
but
looked
as
grave
as
ever
and
hinted
that
before
we
got
across
i
should
probably
reconsider
his
proposal
in
the
course
of
time
we
went
to
breakfast
at
which
only
an
inconsiderable
number
of
passengers
assembled
i
noticed
that
one
or
two
of
the
officers
who
breakfasted
with
us
looked
grave
after
breakfast
i
went
into
my
in
order
to
get
a
book
the
curtains
of
the
upper
berth
were
still
closely
drawn
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
my
was
probably
still
asleep
as
i
came
out
i
met
the
steward
whose
business
it
was
to
look
after
me
he
whispered
that
the
captain
wanted
to
see
me
and
then
scuttled
away
down
the
passage
as
if
very
anxious
to
avoid
any
questions
i
went
toward
the
captain
cabin
and
found
him
waiting
for
me
sir
said
he
i
want
to
ask
a
favour
of
you
i
answered
that
i
would
do
anything
to
oblige
him
your
has
disappeared
he
said
he
is
known
to
have
turned
in
early
last
night
did
you
notice
anything
extraordinary
in
his
manner
the
question
coming
as
it
did
in
exact
confirmation
of
the
fears
the
doctor
had
expressed
half
an
hour
earlier
staggered
me
you
do
mean
to
say
he
has
gone
overboard
i
asked
i
fear
he
has
answered
the
captain
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
thing
i
began
why
he
asked
he
is
the
fourth
then
i
explained
in
answer
to
another
question
from
the
captain
i
explained
without
mentioning
the
doctor
that
i
had
heard
the
story
concerning
he
seemed
very
much
annoyed
at
hearing
that
i
knew
of
it
i
told
him
what
had
occurred
in
the
night
what
you
say
he
replied
coincides
almost
exactly
with
what
was
told
me
by
the
of
two
of
the
other
three
they
bolt
out
of
bed
and
run
down
the
passage
two
of
them
were
seen
to
go
overboard
by
the
watch
we
stopped
and
lowered
boats
but
they
were
not
found
nobody
however
saw
or
heard
the
man
who
was
lost
last
night
if
he
is
really
lost
the
steward
who
is
a
superstitious
fellow
perhaps
and
expected
something
to
go
wrong
went
to
look
for
him
this
morning
and
found
his
berth
empty
but
his
clothes
lying
about
just
as
he
had
left
them
the
steward
was
the
only
man
on
board
who
knew
him
by
sight
and
he
has
been
searching
everywhere
for
him
he
has
disappeared
now
sir
i
want
to
beg
you
not
to
mention
the
circumstance
to
any
of
the
passengers
i
do
want
the
ship
to
get
a
bad
name
and
nothing
hangs
about
an
like
stories
of
suicides
you
shall
have
your
choice
of
any
one
of
the
officers
cabins
you
like
including
my
own
for
the
rest
of
the
passage
is
that
a
fair
bargain
very
said
i
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
but
since
i
am
alone
and
have
the
to
myself
i
would
rather
not
move
if
the
steward
will
take
out
that
unfortunate
man
things
i
would
as
lief
stay
where
i
am
i
will
not
say
anything
about
the
matter
and
i
think
i
can
promise
you
that
i
will
not
follow
my
the
captain
tried
to
dissuade
me
from
my
intention
but
i
preferred
having
a
alone
to
being
the
chum
of
any
officer
on
board
i
do
not
know
whether
i
acted
foolishly
but
if
i
had
taken
his
advice
i
should
have
had
nothing
more
to
tell
there
would
have
remained
the
disagreeable
coincidence
of
several
suicides
occurring
among
men
who
had
slept
in
the
same
cabin
but
that
would
have
been
all
that
was
not
the
end
of
the
matter
however
by
any
means
i
obstinately
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
not
be
disturbed
by
such
tales
and
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
argue
the
question
with
the
captain
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
i
said
it
was
rather
damp
the
porthole
had
been
left
open
last
night
my
might
have
been
ill
when
he
came
on
board
and
he
might
have
become
delirious
after
he
went
to
bed
he
might
even
now
be
hiding
somewhere
on
board
and
might
be
found
later
the
place
ought
to
be
aired
and
the
fastening
of
the
port
looked
to
if
the
captain
would
give
me
leave
i
would
see
that
what
i
thought
necessary
were
done
immediately
of
course
you
have
a
right
to
stay
where
you
are
if
you
please
he
replied
rather
petulantly
but
i
wish
you
would
turn
out
and
let
me
lock
the
place
up
and
be
done
with
it
i
did
not
see
it
in
the
same
light
and
left
the
captain
after
promising
to
be
silent
concerning
the
disappearance
of
my
companion
the
latter
had
had
no
acquaintances
on
board
and
was
not
missed
in
the
course
of
the
day
towards
evening
i
met
the
doctor
again
and
he
asked
me
whether
i
had
changed
my
mind
i
told
him
i
had
not
then
you
will
before
long
he
said
very
gravely
chapter
iii
we
played
whist
in
the
evening
and
i
went
to
bed
late
i
will
confess
now
that
i
felt
a
disagreeable
sensation
when
i
entered
my
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
the
tall
man
i
had
seen
on
the
previous
night
who
was
now
dead
drowned
tossing
about
in
the
long
swell
two
or
three
hundred
miles
astern
his
face
rose
very
distinctly
before
me
as
i
undressed
and
i
even
went
so
far
as
to
draw
back
the
curtains
of
the
upper
berth
as
though
to
persuade
myself
that
he
was
actually
gone
i
also
bolted
the
door
of
the
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
the
porthole
was
open
and
fastened
back
this
was
more
than
i
could
stand
i
hastily
threw
on
my
and
went
in
search
of
robert
the
steward
of
my
passage
i
was
very
angry
i
remember
and
when
i
found
him
i
dragged
him
roughly
to
the
door
of
and
pushed
him
towards
the
open
porthole
what
the
deuce
do
you
mean
you
scoundrel
by
leaving
that
port
open
every
night
do
you
know
it
is
against
the
regulations
do
you
know
that
if
the
ship
heeled
and
the
water
began
to
come
in
ten
men
could
not
shut
it
i
will
report
you
to
the
captain
you
blackguard
for
endangering
the
ship
i
was
exceedingly
wroth
the
man
trembled
and
turned
pale
and
then
began
to
shut
the
round
glass
plate
with
the
heavy
brass
fittings
why
do
you
answer
me
i
said
roughly
if
you
please
sir
faltered
robert
there
nobody
on
board
as
can
keep
this
port
shut
at
night
you
can
try
it
yourself
sir
i
to
stop
hany
longer
on
board
o
this
vessel
sir
i
ai
indeed
but
if
i
was
you
sir
i
just
clear
out
and
go
and
sleep
with
the
surgeon
or
something
i
would
look
sir
is
that
fastened
what
you
may
call
securely
or
not
sir
try
it
sir
see
if
it
will
move
a
hinch
i
tried
the
port
and
found
it
perfectly
tight
well
sir
continued
robert
triumphantly
i
wager
my
reputation
as
a
steward
that
in
an
hour
it
will
be
open
again
fastened
back
too
sir
that
the
horful
thing
fastened
back
i
examined
the
great
screw
and
the
looped
nut
that
ran
on
it
if
i
find
it
open
in
the
night
robert
i
will
give
you
a
sovereign
it
is
not
possible
you
may
go
soverin
did
you
say
sir
very
good
sir
thank
ye
sir
sir
pleasant
reepose
sir
and
all
manner
of
hinchantin
dreams
sir
robert
scuttled
away
delighted
at
being
released
of
course
i
thought
he
was
trying
to
account
for
his
negligence
by
a
silly
story
intended
to
frighten
me
and
i
disbelieved
him
the
consequence
was
that
he
got
his
sovereign
and
i
spent
a
very
peculiarly
unpleasant
night
i
went
to
bed
and
five
minutes
after
i
had
rolled
myself
up
in
my
blankets
the
inexorable
robert
extinguished
the
light
that
burned
steadily
behind
the
pane
near
the
door
i
lay
quite
still
in
the
dark
trying
to
go
to
sleep
but
i
soon
found
that
impossible
it
had
been
some
satisfaction
to
be
angry
with
the
steward
and
the
diversion
had
banished
that
unpleasant
sensation
i
had
at
first
experienced
when
i
thought
of
the
drowned
man
who
had
been
my
chum
but
i
was
no
longer
sleepy
and
i
lay
awake
for
some
time
occasionally
glancing
at
the
porthole
which
i
could
just
see
from
where
i
lay
and
which
in
the
darkness
looked
like
a
faintly
luminous
suspended
in
blackness
i
believe
i
must
have
lain
there
for
an
hour
and
as
i
remember
i
was
just
dozing
into
sleep
when
i
was
roused
by
a
draught
of
cold
air
and
by
distinctly
feeling
the
spray
of
the
sea
blown
upon
my
face
i
started
to
my
feet
and
not
having
allowed
in
the
dark
for
the
motion
of
the
ship
i
was
instantly
thrown
violently
across
the
upon
the
couch
which
was
placed
beneath
the
porthole
i
recovered
myself
immediately
however
and
climbed
upon
my
knees
the
porthole
was
again
wide
open
and
fastened
back
now
these
things
are
facts
i
was
wide
awake
when
i
got
up
and
i
should
certainly
have
been
waked
by
the
fall
had
i
still
been
dozing
moreover
i
bruised
my
elbows
and
knees
badly
and
the
bruises
were
there
on
the
following
morning
to
testify
to
the
fact
if
i
myself
had
doubted
it
the
porthole
was
wide
open
and
fastened
back
a
thing
so
unaccountable
that
i
remember
very
well
feeling
astonishment
rather
than
fear
when
i
discovered
it
i
at
once
closed
the
plate
again
and
screwed
down
the
loop
nut
with
all
my
strength
it
was
very
dark
in
the
i
reflected
that
the
port
had
certainly
been
opened
within
an
hour
after
robert
had
at
first
shut
it
in
my
presence
and
i
determined
to
watch
it
and
see
whether
it
would
open
again
those
brass
fittings
are
very
heavy
and
by
no
means
easy
to
move
i
could
not
believe
that
the
clump
had
been
turned
by
the
shaking
of
the
screw
i
stood
peering
out
through
the
thick
glass
at
the
alternate
white
and
grey
streaks
of
the
sea
that
foamed
beneath
the
ship
side
i
must
have
remained
there
a
quarter
of
an
hour
suddenly
as
i
stood
i
distinctly
heard
something
moving
behind
me
in
one
of
the
berths
and
a
moment
afterwards
just
as
i
turned
instinctively
to
look
though
i
could
of
course
see
nothing
in
the
darkness
i
heard
a
very
faint
groan
i
sprang
across
the
and
tore
the
curtains
of
the
upper
berth
aside
thrusting
in
my
hands
to
discover
if
there
were
any
one
there
there
was
some
one
i
remember
that
the
sensation
as
i
put
my
hands
forward
was
as
though
i
were
plunging
them
into
the
air
of
a
damp
cellar
and
from
behind
the
curtains
came
a
gust
of
wind
that
smelled
horribly
of
stagnant
i
laid
hold
of
something
that
had
the
shape
of
a
man
arm
but
was
smooth
and
wet
and
icy
cold
but
suddenly
as
i
pulled
the
creature
sprang
violently
forward
against
me
a
clammy
oozy
mass
as
it
seemed
to
me
heavy
and
wet
yet
endowed
with
a
sort
of
supernatural
strength
i
reeled
across
the
and
in
an
instant
the
door
opened
and
the
thing
rushed
out
i
had
not
had
time
to
be
frightened
and
quickly
recovering
myself
i
sprang
through
the
door
and
gave
chase
at
the
top
of
my
speed
but
i
was
too
late
ten
yards
before
me
i
could
see
i
am
sure
i
saw
it
a
dark
shadow
moving
in
the
dimly
lighted
passage
quickly
as
the
shadow
of
a
fast
horse
thrown
before
a
dogcart
by
the
lamp
on
a
dark
night
but
in
a
moment
it
had
disappeared
and
i
found
myself
holding
on
to
the
polished
rail
that
ran
along
the
bulkhead
where
the
passage
turned
towards
the
companion
my
hair
stood
on
end
and
the
cold
perspiration
rolled
down
my
face
i
am
not
ashamed
of
it
in
the
least
i
was
very
badly
frightened
still
i
doubted
my
senses
and
pulled
myself
together
it
was
absurd
i
thought
the
welsh
rarebit
i
had
eaten
had
disagreed
with
me
i
had
been
in
a
nightmare
i
made
my
way
back
to
my
and
entered
it
with
an
effort
the
whole
place
smelled
of
stagnant
as
it
had
when
i
had
waked
on
the
previous
evening
it
required
my
utmost
strength
to
go
in
and
grope
among
my
things
for
a
box
of
wax
lights
as
i
lighted
a
railway
reading
lantern
which
i
always
carry
in
case
i
want
to
read
after
the
lamps
are
out
i
perceived
that
the
porthole
was
again
open
and
a
sort
of
creeping
horror
began
to
take
possession
of
me
which
i
never
felt
before
nor
wish
to
feel
again
but
i
got
a
light
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
upper
berth
expecting
to
find
it
drenched
with
but
i
was
disappointed
the
bed
had
been
slept
in
and
the
smell
of
the
sea
was
strong
but
the
bedding
was
as
dry
as
a
bone
i
fancied
that
robert
had
not
had
the
courage
to
make
the
bed
after
the
accident
of
the
previous
night
it
had
all
been
a
hideous
dream
i
drew
the
curtains
back
as
far
as
i
could
and
examined
the
place
very
carefully
it
was
perfectly
dry
but
the
porthole
was
open
again
with
a
sort
of
dull
bewilderment
of
horror
i
closed
it
and
screwed
it
down
and
thrusting
my
heavy
stick
through
the
brass
loop
wrenched
it
with
all
my
might
till
the
thick
metal
began
to
bend
under
the
pressure
then
i
hooked
my
reading
lantern
into
the
red
velvet
at
the
head
of
the
couch
and
sat
down
to
recover
my
senses
if
i
could
i
sat
there
all
night
unable
to
think
of
rest
hardly
able
to
think
at
all
but
the
porthole
remained
closed
and
i
did
not
believe
it
would
now
open
again
without
the
application
of
a
considerable
force
the
morning
dawned
at
last
and
i
dressed
myself
slowly
thinking
over
all
that
had
happened
in
the
night
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
i
went
on
deck
glad
to
get
out
into
the
early
pure
sunshine
and
to
smell
the
breeze
from
the
blue
water
so
different
from
the
noisome
stagnant
odour
of
my
instinctively
i
turned
aft
towards
the
surgeon
cabin
there
he
stood
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
taking
his
morning
airing
precisely
as
on
the
preceding
day
said
he
quietly
but
looking
at
me
with
evident
curiosity
doctor
you
were
quite
right
said
i
there
is
something
wrong
about
that
place
i
thought
you
would
change
your
mind
he
answered
rather
triumphantly
you
have
had
a
bad
night
eh
shall
i
make
you
a
i
have
a
capital
recipe
no
thanks
i
cried
but
i
would
like
to
tell
you
what
happened
i
then
tried
to
explain
as
clearly
as
possible
precisely
what
had
occurred
not
omitting
to
state
that
i
had
been
scared
as
i
had
never
been
scared
in
my
whole
life
before
i
dwelt
particularly
on
the
phenomenon
of
the
porthole
which
was
a
fact
to
which
i
could
testify
even
if
the
rest
had
been
an
illusion
i
had
closed
it
twice
in
the
night
and
the
second
time
i
had
actually
bent
the
brass
in
wrenching
it
with
my
stick
i
believe
i
insisted
a
good
deal
on
this
point
you
seem
to
think
i
am
likely
to
doubt
the
story
said
the
doctor
smiling
at
the
detailed
account
of
the
state
of
the
porthole
i
do
not
doubt
it
in
the
least
i
renew
my
invitation
to
you
bring
your
traps
here
and
take
half
my
cabin
come
and
take
half
of
mine
for
one
night
i
said
help
me
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
this
thing
you
will
get
to
the
bottom
of
something
else
if
you
try
answered
the
doctor
what
i
asked
the
bottom
of
the
sea
i
am
going
to
leave
this
ship
it
is
not
canny
then
you
will
not
help
me
to
find
out
not
i
said
the
doctor
quickly
it
is
my
business
to
keep
my
wits
about
me
not
to
go
fiddling
about
with
ghosts
and
things
do
you
really
believe
it
is
a
ghost
i
enquired
rather
contemptuously
but
as
i
spoke
i
remembered
very
well
the
horrible
sensation
of
the
supernatural
which
had
got
possession
of
me
during
the
night
the
doctor
turned
sharply
on
me
have
you
any
reasonable
explanation
of
these
things
to
offer
he
asked
no
you
have
not
well
you
say
you
will
find
an
explanation
i
say
that
you
wo
sir
simply
because
there
is
not
any
but
my
dear
sir
i
retorted
do
you
a
man
of
science
mean
to
tell
me
that
such
things
can
not
be
explained
i
do
he
answered
stoutly
and
if
they
could
i
would
not
be
concerned
in
the
explanation
i
did
not
care
to
spend
another
night
alone
in
the
and
yet
i
was
obstinately
determined
to
get
at
the
root
of
the
disturbances
i
do
not
believe
there
are
many
men
who
would
have
slept
there
alone
after
passing
two
such
nights
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
it
if
i
could
not
get
any
one
to
share
a
watch
with
me
the
doctor
was
evidently
not
inclined
for
such
an
experiment
he
said
he
was
a
surgeon
and
that
in
case
any
accident
occurred
on
board
he
must
be
always
in
readiness
he
could
not
afford
to
have
his
nerves
unsettled
perhaps
he
was
quite
right
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
his
precaution
was
prompted
by
his
inclination
on
enquiry
he
informed
me
that
there
was
no
one
on
board
who
would
be
likely
to
join
me
in
my
investigations
and
after
a
little
more
conversation
i
left
him
a
little
later
i
met
the
captain
and
told
him
my
story
i
said
that
if
no
one
would
spend
the
night
with
me
i
would
ask
leave
to
have
the
light
burning
all
night
and
would
try
it
alone
look
here
said
he
i
will
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
will
share
your
watch
myself
and
we
will
see
what
happens
it
is
my
belief
that
we
can
find
out
between
us
there
may
be
some
fellow
skulking
on
board
who
steals
a
passage
by
frightening
the
passengers
it
is
just
possible
that
there
may
be
something
queer
in
the
carpentering
of
that
berth
i
suggested
taking
the
ship
carpenter
below
and
examining
the
place
but
i
was
overjoyed
at
the
captain
offer
to
spend
the
night
with
me
he
accordingly
sent
for
the
workman
and
ordered
him
to
do
anything
i
required
we
went
below
at
once
i
had
all
the
bedding
cleared
out
of
the
upper
berth
and
we
examined
the
place
thoroughly
to
see
if
there
was
a
board
loose
anywhere
or
a
panel
which
could
be
opened
or
pushed
aside
we
tried
the
planks
everywhere
tapped
the
flooring
unscrewed
the
fittings
of
the
lower
berth
and
took
it
to
pieces
in
short
there
was
not
a
square
inch
of
the
which
was
not
searched
and
tested
everything
was
in
perfect
order
and
we
put
everything
back
in
its
place
as
we
were
finishing
our
work
robert
came
to
the
door
and
looked
in
well
sir
find
anything
sir
he
asked
with
a
ghastly
grin
you
were
right
about
the
porthole
robert
i
said
and
i
gave
him
the
promised
sovereign
the
carpenter
did
his
work
silently
and
skilfully
following
my
directions
when
he
had
done
he
spoke
i
a
plain
man
sir
he
said
but
it
my
belief
you
had
better
just
turn
out
your
things
and
let
me
run
half
a
dozen
screws
through
the
door
of
this
cabin
there
no
good
never
came
o
this
cabin
yet
sir
and
that
all
about
it
there
been
four
lives
lost
out
here
to
my
own
remembrance
and
that
in
four
trips
better
give
it
up
sir
better
give
it
up
i
will
try
it
for
one
night
more
i
said
better
give
it
up
sir
better
give
it
up
it
a
precious
bad
job
repeated
the
workman
putting
his
tools
in
his
bag
and
leaving
the
cabin
but
my
spirits
had
risen
considerably
at
the
prospect
of
having
the
captain
company
and
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
be
prevented
from
going
to
the
end
of
the
strange
business
i
abstained
from
welsh
rarebits
and
grog
that
evening
and
did
not
even
join
in
the
customary
game
of
whist
i
wanted
to
be
quite
sure
of
my
nerves
and
my
vanity
made
me
anxious
to
make
a
good
figure
in
the
captain
eyes
chapter
iv
the
captain
was
one
of
those
splendidly
tough
and
cheerful
specimens
of
seafaring
humanity
whose
combined
courage
hardihood
and
calmness
in
difficulty
leads
them
naturally
into
high
positions
of
trust
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
led
away
by
an
idle
tale
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
willing
to
join
me
in
the
investigation
was
proof
that
he
thought
there
was
something
seriously
wrong
which
could
not
be
accounted
for
on
ordinary
theories
nor
laughed
down
as
a
common
superstition
to
some
extent
too
his
reputation
was
at
stake
as
well
as
the
reputation
of
the
ship
it
is
no
light
thing
to
lose
passengers
overboard
and
he
knew
it
about
ten
that
evening
as
i
was
smoking
a
last
cigar
he
came
up
to
me
and
drew
me
aside
from
the
beat
of
the
other
passengers
who
were
patrolling
the
deck
in
the
warm
darkness
this
is
a
serious
matter
brisbane
he
said
we
must
make
up
our
minds
either
way
to
be
disappointed
or
to
have
a
pretty
rough
time
of
it
you
see
i
can
not
afford
to
laugh
at
the
affair
and
i
will
ask
you
to
sign
your
name
to
a
statement
of
whatever
occurs
if
nothing
happens
we
will
try
it
again
and
next
day
are
you
ready
so
we
went
below
and
entered
the
as
we
went
in
i
could
see
robert
the
steward
who
stood
a
little
further
down
the
passage
watching
us
with
his
usual
grin
as
though
certain
that
something
dreadful
was
about
to
happen
the
captain
closed
the
door
behind
us
and
bolted
it
supposing
we
put
your
portmanteau
before
the
door
he
suggested
one
of
us
can
sit
on
it
nothing
can
get
out
then
is
the
port
screwed
down
i
found
it
as
i
had
left
it
in
the
morning
indeed
without
using
a
lever
as
i
had
done
no
one
could
have
opened
it
i
drew
back
the
curtains
of
the
upper
berth
so
that
i
could
see
well
into
it
by
the
captain
advice
i
lighted
my
reading
lantern
and
placed
it
so
that
it
shone
upon
the
white
sheets
above
he
insisted
upon
sitting
on
the
portmanteau
declaring
that
he
wished
to
be
able
to
swear
that
he
had
sat
before
the
door
then
he
requested
me
to
search
the
stateroom
thoroughly
an
operation
very
soon
accomplished
as
it
consisted
merely
in
looking
beneath
the
lower
berth
and
under
the
couch
below
the
porthole
the
spaces
were
quite
empty
it
is
impossible
for
any
human
being
to
get
in
i
said
or
for
any
human
being
to
open
the
port
very
good
said
the
captain
calmly
if
we
see
anything
now
it
must
be
either
imagination
or
something
supernatural
i
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
lower
berth
the
first
time
it
happened
said
the
captain
crossing
his
legs
and
leaning
back
against
the
door
was
in
march
the
passenger
who
slept
here
in
the
upper
berth
turned
out
to
have
been
a
lunatic
at
all
events
he
was
known
to
have
been
a
little
touched
and
he
had
taken
his
passage
without
the
knowledge
of
his
friends
he
rushed
out
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
threw
himself
overboard
before
the
officer
who
had
the
watch
could
stop
him
we
stopped
and
lowered
a
boat
it
was
a
quiet
night
just
before
that
heavy
weather
came
on
but
we
could
not
find
him
of
course
his
suicide
was
afterwards
accounted
for
on
the
ground
of
his
insanity
i
suppose
that
often
happens
i
remarked
rather
absently
not
often
no
said
the
captain
never
before
in
my
experience
though
i
have
heard
of
it
happening
on
board
of
other
ships
well
as
i
was
saying
that
occurred
in
march
on
the
very
next
trip
what
are
you
looking
at
he
asked
stopping
suddenly
in
his
narration
i
believe
i
gave
no
answer
my
eyes
were
riveted
upon
the
porthole
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
brass
was
beginning
to
turn
very
slowly
upon
the
screw
so
slowly
however
that
i
was
not
sure
it
moved
at
all
i
watched
it
intently
fixing
its
position
in
my
mind
and
trying
to
ascertain
whether
it
changed
seeing
where
i
was
looking
the
captain
looked
too
it
moves
he
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
conviction
no
it
does
not
he
added
after
a
minute
if
it
were
the
jarring
of
the
screw
said
i
it
would
have
opened
during
the
day
but
i
found
it
this
evening
jammed
tight
as
i
left
it
this
morning
i
rose
and
tried
the
nut
it
was
certainly
loosened
for
by
an
effort
i
could
move
it
with
my
hands
the
queer
thing
said
the
captain
is
that
the
second
man
who
was
lost
is
supposed
to
have
got
through
that
very
port
we
had
a
terrible
time
over
it
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
the
weather
was
very
heavy
there
was
an
alarm
that
one
of
the
ports
was
open
and
the
sea
running
in
i
came
below
and
found
everything
flooded
the
water
pouring
in
every
time
she
rolled
and
the
whole
port
swinging
from
the
top
bolts
not
the
porthole
in
the
middle
well
we
managed
to
shut
it
but
the
water
did
some
damage
ever
since
that
the
place
smells
of
from
time
to
time
we
supposed
the
passenger
had
thrown
himself
out
though
the
lord
only
knows
how
he
did
it
the
steward
kept
telling
me
that
he
can
not
keep
anything
shut
here
upon
my
word
i
can
smell
it
now
can
not
you
he
enquired
sniffing
the
air
suspiciously
yes
distinctly
i
said
and
i
shuddered
as
that
same
odour
of
stagnant
grew
stronger
in
the
cabin
now
to
smell
like
this
the
place
must
be
damp
i
continued
and
yet
when
i
examined
it
with
the
carpenter
this
morning
everything
was
perfectly
dry
it
is
most
extraordinary
hallo
my
reading
lantern
which
had
been
placed
in
the
upper
berth
was
suddenly
extinguished
there
was
still
a
good
deal
of
light
from
the
pane
of
ground
glass
near
the
door
behind
which
loomed
the
regulation
lamp
the
ship
rolled
heavily
and
the
curtain
of
the
upper
berth
swung
far
out
into
the
and
back
again
i
rose
quickly
from
my
seat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
the
captain
at
the
same
moment
started
to
his
feet
with
a
loud
cry
of
surprise
i
had
turned
with
the
intention
of
taking
down
the
lantern
to
examine
it
when
i
heard
his
exclamation
and
immediately
afterwards
his
call
for
help
i
sprang
towards
him
he
was
wrestling
with
all
his
might
with
the
brass
loop
of
the
port
it
seemed
to
turn
against
his
hands
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
i
caught
up
my
cane
a
heavy
oak
stick
i
always
used
to
carry
and
thrust
it
through
the
ring
and
bore
on
it
with
all
my
strength
but
the
strong
wood
snapped
suddenly
and
i
fell
upon
the
couch
when
i
rose
again
the
port
was
wide
open
and
the
captain
was
standing
with
his
back
against
the
door
pale
to
the
lips
there
is
something
in
that
berth
he
cried
in
a
strange
voice
his
eyes
almost
starting
from
his
head
hold
the
door
while
i
look
it
shall
not
escape
us
whatever
it
is
but
instead
of
taking
his
place
i
sprang
upon
the
lower
bed
and
seized
something
which
lay
in
the
upper
berth
it
was
something
ghostly
horrible
beyond
words
and
it
moved
in
my
grip
it
was
like
the
body
of
a
man
long
drowned
and
yet
it
moved
and
had
the
strength
of
ten
men
living
but
i
gripped
it
with
all
my
might
the
slippery
oozy
horrible
thing
the
dead
white
eyes
seemed
to
stare
at
me
out
of
the
dusk
the
putrid
odour
of
rank
was
about
it
and
its
shiny
hair
hung
in
foul
wet
curls
over
its
dead
face
i
wrestled
with
the
dead
thing
it
thrust
itself
upon
me
and
forced
me
back
and
nearly
broke
my
arms
it
wound
its
corpse
arms
about
my
neck
the
living
death
and
overpowered
me
so
that
i
at
last
cried
aloud
and
fell
and
left
my
hold
as
i
fell
the
thing
sprang
across
me
and
seemed
to
throw
itself
upon
the
captain
when
i
last
saw
him
on
his
feet
his
face
was
white
and
his
lips
set
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
struck
a
violent
blow
at
the
dead
being
and
then
he
too
fell
forward
upon
his
face
with
an
inarticulate
cry
of
horror
the
thing
paused
an
instant
seeming
to
hover
over
his
prostrate
body
and
i
could
have
screamed
again
for
very
fright
but
i
had
no
voice
left
the
thing
vanished
suddenly
and
it
seemed
to
my
disturbed
senses
that
it
made
its
exit
through
the
open
port
though
how
that
was
possible
considering
the
smallness
of
the
aperture
is
more
than
any
one
can
tell
i
lay
a
long
time
upon
the
floor
and
the
captain
lay
beside
me
at
last
i
partially
recovered
my
senses
and
moved
and
instantly
i
knew
that
my
arm
was
broken
the
small
bone
of
the
left
forearm
near
the
wrist
i
got
upon
my
feet
somehow
and
with
my
remaining
hand
i
tried
to
raise
the
captain
he
groaned
and
moved
and
at
last
came
to
himself
he
was
not
hurt
but
he
seemed
badly
stunned
well
do
you
want
to
hear
any
more
there
is
nothing
more
that
is
the
end
of
my
story
the
carpenter
carried
out
his
scheme
of
running
half
a
dozen
screws
through
the
door
of
and
if
ever
you
take
a
passage
in
the
you
may
ask
for
a
berth
in
that
you
will
be
told
that
it
is
engaged
yes
it
is
engaged
by
that
dead
thing
i
finished
the
trip
in
the
surgeon
cabin
he
doctored
my
broken
arm
and
advised
me
not
to
fiddle
about
with
ghosts
and
things
any
more
the
captain
was
very
silent
and
never
sailed
again
in
that
ship
though
it
is
still
running
and
i
will
not
sail
in
her
either
it
was
a
very
disagreeable
experience
and
i
was
very
badly
frightened
which
is
a
thing
i
do
not
like
that
is
all
that
is
how
i
saw
a
ghost
if
it
was
a
ghost
it
was
dead
anyhow
by
the
waters
of
paradise
i
remember
my
childhood
very
distinctly
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
argues
a
good
memory
for
i
have
never
been
clever
at
learning
words
by
heart
in
prose
or
rhyme
so
that
i
believe
my
remembrance
of
events
depends
much
more
upon
the
events
themselves
than
upon
my
possessing
any
special
facility
for
recalling
them
perhaps
i
am
too
imaginative
and
the
earliest
impressions
i
received
were
of
a
kind
to
stimulate
the
imagination
abnormally
a
long
series
of
little
misfortunes
connected
with
each
other
so
as
to
suggest
a
sort
of
weird
fatality
so
worked
upon
my
melancholy
temperament
when
i
was
a
boy
that
before
i
was
of
age
i
sincerely
believed
myself
to
be
under
a
curse
and
not
only
myself
but
my
whole
family
and
every
individual
who
bore
my
name
i
was
born
in
the
old
place
where
my
father
and
his
father
and
all
his
predecessors
had
been
born
beyond
the
memory
of
man
it
is
a
very
old
house
and
the
greater
part
of
it
was
originally
a
castle
strongly
fortified
and
surrounded
by
a
deep
moat
supplied
with
abundant
water
from
the
hills
by
a
hidden
aqueduct
many
of
the
fortifications
have
been
destroyed
and
the
moat
has
been
filled
up
the
water
from
the
aqueduct
supplies
great
fountains
and
runs
down
into
huge
oblong
basins
in
the
terraced
gardens
one
below
the
other
each
surrounded
by
a
broad
pavement
of
marble
between
the
water
and
the
the
waste
surplus
finally
escapes
through
an
artificial
grotto
some
thirty
yards
long
into
a
stream
flowing
down
through
the
park
to
the
meadows
beyond
and
thence
to
the
distant
river
the
buildings
were
extended
a
little
and
greatly
altered
more
than
two
hundred
years
ago
in
the
time
of
charles
but
since
then
little
has
been
done
to
improve
them
though
they
have
been
kept
in
fairly
good
repair
according
to
our
fortunes
in
the
gardens
there
are
terraces
and
huge
hedges
of
box
and
evergreen
some
of
which
used
to
be
clipped
into
shapes
of
animals
in
the
italian
style
i
can
remember
when
i
was
a
lad
how
i
used
to
try
to
make
out
what
the
trees
were
cut
to
represent
and
how
i
used
to
appeal
for
explanations
to
judith
my
welsh
nurse
she
dealt
in
a
strange
mythology
of
her
own
and
peopled
the
gardens
with
griffins
dragons
good
genii
and
bad
and
filled
my
mind
with
them
at
the
same
time
my
nursery
window
afforded
a
view
of
the
great
fountains
at
the
head
of
the
upper
basin
and
on
moonlight
nights
the
welshwoman
would
hold
me
up
to
the
glass
and
bid
me
look
at
the
mist
and
spray
rising
into
mysterious
shapes
moving
mystically
in
the
white
light
like
living
things
it
the
woman
of
the
water
she
used
to
say
and
sometimes
she
would
threaten
that
if
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
the
woman
of
the
water
would
steal
up
to
the
high
window
and
carry
me
away
in
her
wet
arms
the
place
was
gloomy
the
broad
basins
of
water
and
the
tall
evergreen
hedges
gave
it
a
funereal
look
and
the
marble
causeways
by
the
pools
might
have
been
made
of
tombstones
the
grey
and
walls
and
towers
without
the
dark
and
massively
furnished
rooms
within
the
deep
mysterious
recesses
and
the
heavy
curtains
all
affected
my
spirits
i
was
silent
and
sad
from
my
childhood
there
was
a
great
above
from
which
the
hours
rang
dismally
during
the
day
and
tolled
like
a
knell
in
the
dead
of
night
there
was
no
light
nor
life
in
the
house
for
my
mother
was
a
helpless
invalid
and
my
father
had
grown
melancholy
in
his
long
task
of
caring
for
her
he
was
a
thin
dark
man
with
sad
eyes
kind
i
think
but
silent
and
unhappy
next
to
my
mother
i
believe
he
loved
me
better
than
anything
on
earth
for
he
took
immense
pains
and
trouble
in
teaching
me
and
what
he
taught
me
i
have
never
forgotten
perhaps
it
was
his
only
amusement
and
that
may
be
the
reason
why
i
had
no
nursery
governess
or
teacher
of
any
kind
while
he
lived
i
used
to
be
taken
to
see
my
mother
every
day
and
sometimes
twice
a
day
for
an
hour
at
a
time
then
i
sat
upon
a
little
stool
near
her
feet
and
she
would
ask
me
what
i
had
been
doing
and
what
i
wanted
to
do
i
dare
say
she
saw
already
the
seeds
of
a
profound
melancholy
in
my
nature
for
she
looked
at
me
always
with
a
sad
smile
and
kissed
me
with
a
sigh
when
i
was
taken
away
one
night
when
i
was
just
six
years
old
i
lay
awake
in
the
nursery
the
door
was
not
quite
shut
and
the
welsh
nurse
was
sitting
sewing
in
the
next
room
suddenly
i
heard
her
groan
and
say
in
a
strange
voice
one
two
one
two
i
was
frightened
and
i
jumped
up
and
ran
to
the
door
barefooted
as
i
was
what
is
it
judith
i
cried
clinging
to
her
skirts
i
can
remember
the
look
in
her
strange
dark
eyes
as
she
answered
one
two
leaden
coffins
fallen
from
the
ceiling
she
crooned
working
herself
in
her
chair
one
two
a
light
coffin
and
a
heavy
coffin
falling
to
the
floor
then
she
seemed
to
notice
me
and
she
took
me
back
to
bed
and
sang
me
to
sleep
with
a
queer
old
welsh
song
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
but
the
impression
got
hold
of
me
that
she
had
meant
that
my
father
and
mother
were
going
to
die
very
soon
they
died
in
the
very
room
where
she
had
been
sitting
that
night
it
was
a
great
room
my
day
nursery
full
of
sun
when
there
was
any
and
when
the
days
were
dark
it
was
the
most
cheerful
place
in
the
house
my
mother
grew
rapidly
worse
and
i
was
transferred
to
another
part
of
the
building
to
make
place
for
her
they
thought
my
nursery
was
gayer
for
her
i
suppose
but
she
could
not
live
she
was
beautiful
when
she
was
dead
and
i
cried
bitterly
the
light
one
the
light
one
the
heavy
one
to
come
crooned
the
welshwoman
and
she
was
right
my
father
took
the
room
after
my
mother
was
gone
and
day
by
day
he
grew
thinner
and
paler
and
sadder
the
heavy
one
the
heavy
one
all
of
lead
moaned
my
nurse
one
night
in
december
standing
still
just
as
she
was
going
to
take
away
the
light
after
putting
me
to
bed
then
she
took
me
up
again
and
wrapped
me
in
a
little
gown
and
led
me
away
to
my
father
room
she
knocked
but
no
one
answered
she
opened
the
door
and
we
found
him
in
his
before
the
fire
very
white
quite
dead
so
i
was
alone
with
the
welshwoman
till
strange
people
came
and
relations
whom
i
had
never
seen
and
then
i
heard
them
saying
that
i
must
be
taken
away
to
some
more
cheerful
place
they
were
kind
people
and
i
will
not
believe
that
they
were
kind
only
because
i
was
to
be
very
rich
when
i
grew
to
be
a
man
the
world
never
seemed
to
be
a
very
bad
place
to
me
nor
all
the
people
to
be
miserable
sinners
even
when
i
was
most
melancholy
i
do
not
remember
that
any
one
ever
did
me
any
great
injustice
nor
that
i
was
ever
oppressed
or
in
any
way
even
by
the
boys
at
school
i
was
sad
i
suppose
because
my
childhood
was
so
gloomy
and
later
because
i
was
unlucky
in
everything
i
undertook
till
i
finally
believed
i
was
pursued
by
fate
and
i
used
to
dream
that
the
old
welsh
nurse
and
the
woman
of
the
water
between
them
had
vowed
to
pursue
me
to
my
end
but
my
natural
disposition
should
have
been
cheerful
as
i
have
often
thought
among
lads
of
my
age
i
was
never
last
or
even
among
the
last
in
anything
but
i
was
never
first
if
i
trained
for
a
race
i
was
sure
to
sprain
my
ankle
on
the
day
when
i
was
to
run
if
i
pulled
an
oar
with
others
my
oar
was
sure
to
break
if
i
competed
for
a
prize
some
unforseen
accident
prevented
my
winning
it
at
the
last
moment
nothing
to
which
i
put
my
hand
succeeded
and
i
got
the
reputation
of
being
unlucky
until
my
companions
felt
it
was
always
safe
to
bet
against
me
no
matter
what
the
appearances
might
be
i
became
discouraged
and
listless
in
everything
i
gave
up
the
idea
of
competing
for
any
distinction
at
the
university
comforting
myself
with
the
thought
that
i
could
not
fail
in
the
examination
for
the
ordinary
degree
the
day
before
the
examination
began
i
fell
ill
and
when
at
last
i
recovered
after
a
narrow
escape
from
death
i
turned
my
back
upon
oxford
and
went
down
alone
to
visit
the
old
place
where
i
had
been
born
feeble
in
health
and
profoundly
disgusted
and
discouraged
i
was
years
of
age
master
of
myself
and
of
my
fortune
but
so
deeply
had
the
long
chain
of
small
unlucky
circumstances
affected
me
that
i
thought
seriously
of
shutting
myself
up
from
the
world
to
live
the
life
of
a
hermit
and
to
die
as
soon
as
possible
death
seemed
the
only
cheerful
possibility
in
my
existence
and
my
thoughts
soon
dwelt
upon
it
altogether
i
had
never
shown
any
wish
to
return
to
my
own
home
since
i
had
been
taken
away
as
a
little
boy
and
no
one
had
ever
pressed
me
to
do
so
the
place
had
been
kept
in
order
after
a
fashion
and
did
not
seem
to
have
suffered
during
the
fifteen
years
or
more
of
my
absence
nothing
earthly
could
affect
those
old
grey
walls
that
had
fought
the
elements
for
so
many
centuries
the
garden
was
more
wild
than
i
remembered
it
the
marble
causeways
about
the
pools
looked
more
yellow
and
damp
than
of
old
and
the
whole
place
at
first
looked
smaller
it
was
not
until
i
had
wandered
about
the
house
and
grounds
for
many
hours
that
i
realised
the
huge
size
of
the
home
where
i
was
to
live
in
solitude
then
i
began
to
delight
in
it
and
my
resolution
to
live
alone
grew
stronger
the
people
had
turned
out
to
welcome
me
of
course
and
i
tried
to
recognise
the
changed
faces
of
the
old
gardener
and
the
old
housekeeper
and
to
call
them
by
name
my
old
nurse
i
knew
at
once
she
had
grown
very
grey
since
she
heard
the
coffins
fall
in
the
nursery
fifteen
years
before
but
her
strange
eyes
were
the
same
and
the
look
in
them
woke
all
my
old
memories
she
went
over
the
house
with
me
and
how
is
the
woman
of
the
water
i
asked
trying
to
laugh
a
little
does
she
still
play
in
the
moonlight
she
is
hungry
answered
the
welshwoman
in
a
low
voice
hungry
then
we
will
feed
her
i
laughed
but
old
judith
turned
very
pale
and
looked
at
me
strangely
feed
her
ay
you
will
feed
her
well
she
muttered
glancing
behind
her
at
the
ancient
housekeeper
who
tottered
after
us
with
feeble
steps
through
the
halls
and
passages
i
did
not
think
much
of
her
words
she
had
always
talked
oddly
as
welshwomen
will
and
though
i
was
very
melancholy
i
am
sure
i
was
not
superstitious
and
i
was
certainly
not
timid
only
as
in
a
dream
i
seemed
to
see
her
standing
with
the
light
in
her
hand
and
muttering
the
heavy
one
all
of
lead
and
then
leading
a
little
boy
through
the
long
corridors
to
see
his
father
lying
dead
in
a
great
before
a
smouldering
fire
so
we
went
over
the
house
and
i
chose
the
rooms
where
i
would
live
and
the
servants
i
had
brought
with
me
ordered
and
arranged
everything
and
i
had
no
more
trouble
i
did
not
care
what
they
did
provided
i
was
left
in
peace
and
was
not
expected
to
give
directions
for
i
was
more
listless
than
ever
owing
to
the
effects
of
my
illness
at
college
i
dined
in
solitary
state
and
the
melancholy
grandeur
of
the
vast
old
pleased
me
then
i
went
to
the
room
i
had
selected
for
my
study
and
sat
down
in
a
deep
chair
under
a
bright
light
to
think
or
to
let
my
thoughts
meander
through
labyrinths
of
their
own
choosing
utterly
indifferent
to
the
course
they
might
take
the
tall
windows
of
the
room
opened
to
the
level
of
the
ground
upon
the
terrace
at
the
head
of
the
garden
it
was
in
the
end
of
july
and
everything
was
open
for
the
weather
was
warm
as
i
sat
alone
i
heard
the
unceasing
plash
of
the
great
fountains
and
i
fell
to
thinking
of
the
woman
of
the
water
i
rose
and
went
out
into
the
still
night
and
sat
down
upon
a
seat
on
the
terrace
between
two
gigantic
italian
the
air
was
deliciously
soft
and
sweet
with
the
smell
of
the
flowers
and
the
garden
was
more
congenial
to
me
than
the
house
sad
people
always
like
running
water
and
the
sound
of
it
at
night
though
i
can
not
tell
why
i
sat
and
listened
in
the
gloom
for
it
was
dark
below
and
the
pale
moon
had
not
yet
climbed
over
the
hills
in
front
of
me
though
all
the
air
above
was
light
with
her
rising
beams
slowly
the
white
halo
in
the
eastern
sky
ascended
in
an
arch
above
the
wooded
crests
making
the
outline
of
the
mountains
more
intensely
black
by
contrast
as
though
the
head
of
some
great
white
saint
were
rising
from
behind
a
screen
in
a
vast
cathedral
throwing
misty
glories
from
below
i
longed
to
see
the
moon
herself
and
i
tried
to
reckon
the
seconds
before
she
must
appear
then
she
sprang
up
quickly
and
in
a
moment
more
hung
round
and
perfect
in
the
sky
i
gazed
at
her
and
then
at
the
floating
spray
of
the
tall
fountains
and
down
at
the
pools
where
the
were
rocking
softly
in
their
sleep
on
the
velvet
surface
of
the
moonlit
water
just
then
a
great
swan
floated
out
silently
into
the
midst
of
the
basin
and
wreathed
his
long
neck
catching
the
water
in
his
broad
bill
and
scattering
showers
of
diamonds
around
him
suddenly
as
i
gazed
something
came
between
me
and
the
light
i
looked
up
instantly
between
me
and
the
round
disc
of
the
moon
rose
a
luminous
face
of
a
woman
with
great
strange
eyes
and
a
woman
mouth
full
and
soft
but
not
smiling
hooded
in
black
staring
at
me
as
i
sat
still
upon
my
bench
she
was
close
to
me
so
close
that
i
could
have
touched
her
with
my
hand
but
i
was
transfixed
and
helpless
she
stood
still
for
a
moment
but
her
expression
did
not
change
then
she
passed
swiftly
away
and
my
hair
stood
up
on
my
head
while
the
cold
breeze
from
her
white
dress
was
wafted
to
my
temples
as
she
moved
the
moonlight
shining
through
the
tossing
spray
of
the
fountain
made
traceries
of
shadow
on
the
gleaming
folds
of
her
garments
in
an
instant
she
was
gone
and
i
was
alone
i
was
strangely
shaken
by
the
vision
and
some
time
passed
before
i
could
rise
to
my
feet
for
i
was
still
weak
from
my
illness
and
the
sight
i
had
seen
would
have
startled
any
one
i
did
not
reason
with
myself
for
i
was
certain
that
i
had
looked
on
the
unearthly
and
no
argument
could
have
destroyed
that
belief
at
last
i
got
up
and
stood
unsteadily
gazing
in
the
direction
in
which
i
thought
the
figure
had
gone
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
broad
paths
the
tall
dark
evergreen
hedges
the
tossing
water
of
the
fountains
and
the
smooth
pool
below
i
fell
back
upon
the
seat
and
recalled
the
face
i
had
seen
strange
to
say
now
that
the
first
impression
had
passed
there
was
nothing
startling
in
the
recollection
on
the
contrary
i
felt
that
i
was
fascinated
by
the
face
and
would
give
anything
to
see
it
again
i
could
retrace
the
beautiful
straight
features
the
long
dark
eyes
and
the
wonderful
mouth
most
exactly
in
my
mind
and
when
i
had
reconstructed
every
detail
from
memory
i
knew
that
the
whole
was
beautiful
and
that
i
should
love
a
woman
with
such
a
face
i
wonder
whether
she
is
the
woman
of
the
water
i
said
to
myself
then
rising
once
more
i
wandered
down
the
garden
descending
one
short
flight
of
steps
after
another
from
terrace
to
terrace
by
the
edge
of
the
marble
basins
through
the
shadow
and
through
the
moonlight
and
i
crossed
the
water
by
the
rustic
bridge
above
the
artificial
grotto
and
climbed
slowly
up
again
to
the
highest
terrace
by
the
other
side
the
air
seemed
sweeter
and
i
was
very
calm
so
that
i
think
i
smiled
to
myself
as
i
walked
as
though
a
new
happiness
had
come
to
me
the
woman
face
seemed
always
before
me
and
the
thought
of
it
gave
me
an
unwonted
thrill
of
pleasure
unlike
anything
i
had
ever
felt
before
i
turned
as
i
reached
the
house
and
looked
back
upon
the
scene
it
had
certainly
changed
in
the
short
hour
since
i
had
come
out
and
my
mood
had
changed
with
it
just
like
my
luck
i
thought
to
fall
in
love
with
a
ghost
but
in
old
times
i
would
have
sighed
and
gone
to
bed
more
sad
than
ever
at
such
a
melancholy
conclusion
i
felt
happy
almost
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
gloomy
old
study
seemed
cheerful
when
i
went
in
the
old
pictures
on
the
walls
smiled
at
me
and
i
sat
down
in
my
deep
chair
with
a
new
and
delightful
sensation
that
i
was
not
alone
the
idea
of
having
seen
a
ghost
and
of
feeling
much
the
better
for
it
was
so
absurd
that
i
laughed
softly
as
i
took
up
one
of
the
books
i
had
brought
with
me
and
began
to
read
that
impression
did
not
wear
off
i
slept
peacefully
and
in
the
morning
i
threw
open
my
windows
to
the
summer
air
and
looked
down
at
the
garden
at
the
stretches
of
green
and
at
the
coloured
at
the
circling
swallows
and
at
the
bright
water
a
man
might
make
a
paradise
of
this
place
i
exclaimed
a
man
and
a
woman
together
from
that
day
the
old
castle
no
longer
seemed
gloomy
and
i
think
i
ceased
to
be
sad
for
some
time
too
i
began
to
take
an
interest
in
the
place
and
to
try
and
make
it
more
alive
i
avoided
my
old
welsh
nurse
lest
she
should
damp
my
humour
with
some
dismal
prophecy
and
recall
my
old
self
by
bringing
back
memories
of
my
dismal
childhood
but
what
i
thought
of
most
was
the
ghostly
figure
i
had
seen
in
the
garden
that
first
night
after
my
arrival
i
went
out
every
evening
and
wandered
through
the
walks
and
paths
but
try
as
i
might
i
did
not
see
my
vision
again
at
last
after
many
days
the
memory
grew
more
faint
and
my
old
moody
nature
gradually
overcame
the
temporary
sense
of
lightness
i
had
experienced
the
summer
turned
to
autumn
and
i
grew
restless
it
began
to
rain
the
dampness
pervaded
the
gardens
and
the
outer
halls
smelled
musty
like
tombs
the
grey
sky
oppressed
me
intolerably
i
left
the
place
as
it
was
and
went
abroad
determined
to
try
anything
which
might
possibly
make
a
second
break
in
the
monotonous
melancholy
from
which
i
suffered
chapter
ii
most
people
would
be
struck
by
the
utter
insignificance
of
the
small
events
which
after
the
death
of
my
parents
influenced
my
life
and
made
me
unhappy
the
gruesome
forebodings
of
a
welsh
nurse
which
chanced
to
be
realised
by
an
odd
coincidence
of
events
should
not
seem
enough
to
change
the
nature
of
a
child
and
to
direct
the
bent
of
his
character
in
after
years
the
little
disappointments
of
schoolboy
life
and
the
somewhat
less
childish
ones
of
an
uneventful
and
undistinguished
academic
career
should
not
have
sufficed
to
turn
me
out
at
years
of
age
a
melancholic
listless
idler
some
weakness
of
my
own
character
may
have
contributed
to
the
result
but
in
a
greater
degree
it
was
due
to
my
having
a
reputation
for
bad
luck
however
i
will
not
try
to
analyse
the
causes
of
my
state
for
i
should
satisfy
nobody
least
of
all
myself
still
less
will
i
attempt
to
explain
why
i
felt
a
temporary
revival
of
my
spirits
after
my
adventure
in
the
garden
it
is
certain
that
i
was
in
love
with
the
face
i
had
seen
and
that
i
longed
to
see
it
again
that
i
gave
up
all
hope
of
a
second
visitation
grew
more
sad
than
ever
packed
up
my
traps
and
finally
went
abroad
but
in
my
dreams
i
went
back
to
my
home
and
it
always
appeared
to
me
sunny
and
bright
as
it
had
looked
on
that
summer
morning
after
i
had
seen
the
woman
by
the
fountain
i
went
to
paris
i
went
further
and
wandered
about
germany
i
tried
to
amuse
myself
and
i
failed
miserably
with
the
aimless
whims
of
an
idle
and
useless
man
came
all
sorts
of
suggestions
for
good
resolutions
one
day
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
go
and
bury
myself
in
a
german
university
for
a
time
and
live
simply
like
a
poor
student
i
started
with
the
intention
of
going
to
leipzic
determined
to
stay
there
until
some
event
should
direct
my
life
or
change
my
humour
or
make
an
end
of
me
altogether
the
express
train
stopped
at
some
station
of
which
i
did
not
know
the
name
it
was
dusk
on
a
winter
afternoon
and
i
peered
through
the
thick
glass
from
my
seat
suddenly
another
train
came
gliding
in
from
the
opposite
direction
and
stopped
alongside
of
ours
i
looked
at
the
carriage
which
chanced
to
be
abreast
of
mine
and
idly
read
the
black
letters
painted
on
a
white
board
swinging
from
the
brass
handrail
berlin
cologne
paris
then
i
looked
up
at
the
window
above
i
started
violently
and
the
cold
perspiration
broke
out
upon
my
forehead
in
the
dim
light
not
six
feet
from
where
i
sat
i
saw
the
face
of
a
woman
the
face
i
loved
the
straight
fine
features
the
strange
eyes
the
wonderful
mouth
the
pale
skin
her
was
a
dark
veil
which
seemed
to
be
tied
about
her
head
and
passed
over
the
shoulders
under
her
chin
as
i
threw
down
the
window
and
knelt
on
the
cushioned
seat
leaning
far
out
to
get
a
better
view
a
long
whistle
screamed
through
the
station
followed
by
a
quick
series
of
dull
clanking
sounds
then
there
was
a
slight
jerk
and
my
train
moved
on
luckily
the
window
was
narrow
being
the
one
over
the
seat
beside
the
door
or
i
believe
i
would
have
jumped
out
of
it
then
and
there
in
an
instant
the
speed
increased
and
i
was
being
carried
swiftly
away
in
the
opposite
direction
from
the
thing
i
loved
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
lay
back
in
my
place
stunned
by
the
suddenness
of
the
apparition
at
last
one
of
the
two
other
passengers
a
large
and
gorgeous
captain
of
the
white
königsberg
cuirassiers
civilly
but
firmly
suggested
that
i
might
shut
my
window
as
the
evening
was
cold
i
did
so
with
an
apology
and
relapsed
into
silence
the
train
ran
swiftly
on
for
a
long
time
and
it
was
already
beginning
to
slacken
speed
before
entering
another
station
when
i
roused
myself
and
made
a
sudden
resolution
as
the
carriage
stopped
before
the
brilliantly
lighted
platform
i
seized
my
belongings
saluted
my
and
got
out
determined
to
take
the
first
express
back
to
paris
this
time
the
circumstances
of
the
vision
had
been
so
natural
that
it
did
not
strike
me
that
there
was
anything
unreal
about
the
face
or
about
the
woman
to
whom
it
belonged
i
did
not
try
to
explain
to
myself
how
the
face
and
the
woman
could
be
travelling
by
a
fast
train
from
berlin
to
paris
on
a
winter
afternoon
when
both
were
in
my
mind
indelibly
associated
with
the
moonlight
and
the
fountains
in
my
own
english
home
i
certainly
would
not
have
admitted
that
i
had
been
mistaken
in
the
dusk
attributing
to
what
i
had
seen
a
resemblance
to
my
former
vision
which
did
not
really
exist
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
my
mind
and
i
was
positively
sure
that
i
had
again
seen
the
face
i
loved
i
did
not
hesitate
and
in
a
few
hours
i
was
on
my
way
back
to
paris
i
could
not
help
reflecting
on
my
wandering
as
i
had
been
for
many
months
it
might
as
easily
have
chanced
that
i
should
be
travelling
in
the
same
train
with
that
woman
instead
of
going
the
other
way
but
my
luck
was
destined
to
turn
for
a
time
i
searched
paris
for
several
days
i
dined
at
the
principal
hotels
i
went
to
the
theatres
i
rode
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
in
the
morning
and
picked
up
an
acquaintance
whom
i
forced
to
drive
with
me
in
the
afternoon
i
went
to
mass
at
the
madeleine
and
i
attended
the
services
at
the
english
church
i
hung
about
the
louvre
and
notre
dame
i
went
to
versailles
i
spent
hours
in
parading
the
rue
de
rivoli
in
the
neighbourhood
of
meurice
corner
where
foreigners
pass
and
from
morning
till
night
at
last
i
received
an
invitation
to
a
reception
at
the
english
embassy
i
went
and
i
found
what
i
had
sought
so
long
there
she
was
sitting
by
an
old
lady
in
grey
satin
and
diamonds
who
had
a
wrinkled
but
kindly
face
and
keen
grey
eyes
that
seemed
to
take
in
everything
they
saw
with
very
little
inclination
to
give
much
in
return
but
i
did
not
notice
the
chaperon
i
saw
only
the
face
that
had
haunted
me
for
months
and
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
i
walked
quickly
towards
the
pair
forgetting
such
a
trifle
as
the
necessity
for
an
introduction
she
was
far
more
beautiful
than
i
had
thought
but
i
never
doubted
that
it
was
she
herself
and
no
other
vision
or
no
vision
before
this
was
the
reality
and
i
knew
it
twice
her
hair
had
been
covered
now
at
last
i
saw
it
and
the
added
beauty
of
its
magnificence
glorified
the
whole
woman
it
was
rich
hair
fine
and
abundant
golden
with
deep
ruddy
tints
in
it
like
red
bronze
spun
fine
there
was
no
ornament
in
it
not
a
rose
not
a
thread
of
gold
and
i
felt
that
it
needed
nothing
to
enhance
its
splendour
nothing
but
her
pale
face
her
dark
strange
eyes
and
her
heavy
eyebrows
i
could
see
that
she
was
slender
too
but
strong
withal
as
she
sat
there
quietly
gazing
at
the
moving
scene
in
the
midst
of
the
brilliant
lights
and
the
hum
of
perpetual
conversation
i
recollected
the
detail
of
introduction
in
time
and
turned
aside
to
look
for
my
host
i
found
him
at
last
i
begged
him
to
present
me
to
the
two
ladies
pointing
them
out
to
him
at
the
same
time
yes
uh
by
all
means
uh
replied
his
excellency
with
a
pleasant
smile
he
evidently
had
no
idea
of
my
name
which
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
i
am
lord
cairngorm
i
observed
oh
by
all
means
answered
the
ambassador
with
the
same
hospitable
smile
yes
uh
the
fact
is
i
must
try
and
find
out
who
they
are
such
lots
of
people
you
know
oh
if
you
will
present
me
i
will
try
and
find
out
for
you
said
i
laughing
ah
yes
so
kind
of
you
come
along
said
my
host
we
threaded
the
crowd
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
stood
before
the
two
ladies
l
cairngorm
he
said
then
adding
quickly
to
me
come
and
dine
wo
you
he
glided
away
with
his
pleasant
smile
and
disappeared
in
the
crowd
i
sat
down
beside
the
beautiful
girl
conscious
that
the
eyes
of
the
duenna
were
upon
me
i
think
we
have
been
very
near
meeting
before
i
remarked
by
way
of
opening
the
conversation
my
companion
turned
her
eyes
full
upon
me
with
an
air
of
enquiry
she
evidently
did
not
recall
my
face
if
she
had
ever
seen
me
really
i
can
not
remember
she
observed
in
a
low
and
musical
voice
when
in
the
first
place
you
came
down
from
berlin
by
the
express
ten
days
ago
i
was
going
the
other
way
and
our
carriages
stopped
opposite
each
other
i
saw
you
at
the
window
yes
we
came
that
way
but
i
do
not
remember
she
hesitated
secondly
i
continued
i
was
sitting
alone
in
my
garden
last
summer
near
the
end
of
july
do
you
remember
you
must
have
wandered
in
there
through
the
park
you
came
up
to
the
house
and
looked
at
me
was
that
you
she
asked
in
evident
surprise
then
she
broke
into
a
laugh
i
told
everybody
i
had
seen
a
ghost
there
had
never
been
any
cairngorms
in
the
place
since
the
memory
of
man
we
left
the
next
day
and
never
heard
that
you
had
come
there
indeed
i
did
not
know
the
castle
belonged
to
you
where
were
you
staying
i
asked
where
why
with
my
aunt
where
i
always
stay
she
is
your
neighbour
since
it
you
i
beg
your
pardon
but
then
is
your
aunt
lady
bluebell
i
did
not
quite
catch
do
be
afraid
she
is
amazingly
deaf
yes
she
is
the
relict
of
my
beloved
uncle
the
sixteenth
or
seventeenth
baron
bluebell
i
forget
exactly
how
many
of
them
there
have
been
and
i
do
you
know
who
i
am
she
laughed
well
knowing
that
i
did
not
no
i
answered
frankly
i
have
not
the
least
idea
i
asked
to
be
introduced
because
i
recognised
you
perhaps
perhaps
you
are
a
miss
bluebell
considering
that
you
are
a
neighbour
i
will
tell
you
who
i
am
she
answered
no
i
am
of
the
tribe
of
bluebells
but
my
name
is
lammas
and
i
have
been
given
to
understand
that
i
was
christened
margaret
being
a
floral
family
they
call
me
daisy
a
dreadful
american
man
once
told
me
that
my
aunt
was
a
bluebell
and
that
i
was
a
harebell
with
two
l
and
an
e
because
my
hair
is
so
thick
i
warn
you
so
that
you
may
avoid
making
such
a
bad
pun
do
i
look
like
a
man
who
makes
puns
i
asked
being
very
conscious
of
my
melancholy
face
and
sad
looks
miss
lammas
eyed
me
critically
no
you
have
a
mournful
temperament
i
think
i
can
trust
you
she
answered
do
you
think
you
could
communicate
to
my
aunt
the
fact
that
you
are
a
cairngorm
and
a
neighbour
i
am
sure
she
would
like
to
know
i
leaned
towards
the
old
lady
inflating
my
lungs
for
a
yell
but
miss
lammas
stopped
me
that
is
not
of
the
slightest
use
she
remarked
you
can
write
it
on
a
bit
of
paper
she
is
utterly
deaf
i
have
a
pencil
i
answered
but
i
have
no
paper
would
my
cuff
do
do
you
think
oh
yes
replied
miss
lammas
with
alacrity
men
often
do
that
i
wrote
on
my
cuff
miss
lammas
wishes
me
to
explain
that
i
am
your
neighbour
cairngorm
then
i
held
out
my
arm
before
the
old
nose
she
seemed
perfectly
accustomed
to
the
proceeding
put
up
her
glasses
read
the
words
smiled
nodded
and
addressed
me
in
the
unearthly
voice
peculiar
to
people
who
hear
nothing
i
knew
your
grandfather
very
well
she
said
then
she
smiled
and
nodded
to
me
again
and
to
her
niece
and
relapsed
into
silence
it
is
all
right
remarked
miss
lammas
aunt
bluebell
knows
she
is
deaf
and
does
not
say
much
like
the
parrot
you
see
she
knew
your
grandfather
how
odd
that
we
should
be
neighbours
why
have
we
never
met
before
if
you
had
told
me
you
knew
my
grandfather
when
you
appeared
in
the
garden
i
should
not
have
been
in
the
least
surprised
i
answered
rather
irrelevantly
i
really
thought
you
were
the
ghost
of
the
old
fountain
how
in
the
world
did
you
come
there
at
that
hour
we
were
a
large
party
and
we
went
out
for
a
walk
then
we
thought
we
should
like
to
see
what
your
park
was
like
in
the
moonlight
and
so
we
trespassed
i
got
separated
from
the
rest
and
came
upon
you
by
accident
just
as
i
was
admiring
the
extremely
ghostly
look
of
your
house
and
wondering
whether
anybody
would
ever
come
and
live
there
again
it
looks
like
the
castle
of
macbeth
or
a
scene
from
the
opera
do
you
know
anybody
here
hardly
a
soul
do
you
no
aunt
bluebell
said
it
was
our
duty
to
come
it
is
easy
for
her
to
go
out
she
does
not
bear
the
burden
of
the
conversation
i
am
sorry
you
find
it
a
burden
said
i
shall
i
go
away
miss
lammas
looked
at
me
with
a
sudden
gravity
in
her
beautiful
eyes
and
there
was
a
sort
of
hesitation
about
the
lines
of
her
full
soft
mouth
no
she
said
at
last
quite
simply
do
go
away
we
may
like
each
other
if
you
stay
a
little
longer
and
we
ought
to
because
we
are
neighbours
in
the
country
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
thought
miss
lammas
a
very
odd
girl
there
is
indeed
a
sort
of
freemasonry
between
people
who
discover
that
they
live
near
each
other
and
that
they
ought
to
have
known
each
other
before
but
there
was
a
sort
of
unexpected
frankness
and
simplicity
in
the
girl
amusing
manner
which
would
have
struck
any
one
else
as
being
singular
to
say
the
least
of
it
to
me
however
it
all
seemed
natural
enough
i
had
dreamed
of
her
face
too
long
not
to
be
utterly
happy
when
i
met
her
at
last
and
could
talk
to
her
as
much
as
i
pleased
to
me
the
man
of
in
everything
the
whole
meeting
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
i
felt
again
that
strange
sensation
of
lightness
which
i
had
experienced
after
i
had
seen
her
face
in
the
garden
the
great
rooms
seemed
brighter
life
seemed
worth
living
my
sluggish
melancholy
blood
ran
faster
and
filled
me
with
a
new
sense
of
strength
i
said
to
myself
that
without
this
woman
i
was
but
an
imperfect
being
but
that
with
her
i
could
accomplish
everything
to
which
i
should
set
my
hand
like
the
great
doctor
when
he
thought
he
had
cheated
mephistopheles
at
last
i
could
have
cried
aloud
to
the
fleeting
moment
doch
du
bist
so
are
you
always
gay
i
asked
suddenly
how
happy
you
must
be
the
days
would
sometimes
seem
very
long
if
i
were
gloomy
she
answered
thoughtfully
yes
i
think
i
find
life
very
pleasant
and
i
tell
it
so
how
can
you
life
anything
i
enquired
if
i
could
catch
my
life
and
talk
to
it
i
would
abuse
it
prodigiously
i
assure
you
i
dare
say
you
have
a
melancholy
temper
you
ought
to
live
out
of
doors
dig
potatoes
make
hay
shoot
hunt
tumble
into
ditches
and
come
home
muddy
and
hungry
for
dinner
it
would
be
much
better
for
you
than
moping
in
your
rook
tower
and
hating
everything
it
is
rather
lonely
down
there
i
murmured
apologetically
feeling
that
miss
lammas
was
quite
right
then
marry
and
quarrel
with
your
wife
she
laughed
anything
is
better
than
being
alone
i
am
a
very
peaceable
person
i
never
quarrel
with
anybody
you
can
try
it
you
will
find
it
quite
impossible
will
you
let
me
try
she
asked
still
smiling
by
all
means
especially
if
it
is
to
be
only
a
preliminary
canter
i
answered
rashly
what
do
you
mean
she
enquired
turning
quickly
upon
me
oh
nothing
you
might
try
my
paces
with
a
view
to
quarrelling
in
the
future
i
can
not
imagine
how
you
are
going
to
do
it
you
will
have
to
resort
to
immediate
and
direct
abuse
no
i
will
only
say
that
if
you
do
not
like
your
life
it
is
your
own
fault
how
can
a
man
of
your
age
talk
of
being
melancholy
or
of
the
hollowness
of
existence
are
you
consumptive
are
you
subject
to
hereditary
insanity
are
you
deaf
like
aunt
bluebell
are
you
poor
like
lots
of
people
have
you
been
crossed
in
love
have
you
lost
the
world
for
a
woman
or
any
particular
woman
for
the
sake
of
the
world
are
you
feebleminded
a
cripple
an
outcast
are
you
repulsively
ugly
she
laughed
again
is
there
any
reason
in
the
world
why
you
should
not
enjoy
all
you
have
got
in
life
no
there
is
no
reason
whatever
except
that
i
am
dreadfully
unlucky
especially
in
small
things
then
try
big
things
just
for
a
change
suggested
miss
lammas
try
and
get
married
for
instance
and
see
how
it
turns
out
if
it
turned
out
badly
it
would
be
rather
serious
not
half
so
serious
as
it
is
to
abuse
everything
unreasonably
if
abuse
is
your
particular
talent
abuse
something
that
ought
to
be
abused
abuse
the
conservatives
or
the
liberals
it
does
not
matter
which
since
they
are
always
abusing
each
other
make
yourself
felt
by
other
people
you
will
like
it
if
they
do
it
will
make
a
man
of
you
fill
your
mouth
with
pebbles
and
howl
at
the
sea
if
you
can
not
do
anything
else
it
did
demosthenes
no
end
of
good
you
know
you
will
have
the
satisfaction
of
imitating
a
great
man
really
miss
lammas
i
think
the
list
of
innocent
exercises
you
propose
very
well
if
you
do
care
for
that
sort
of
thing
care
for
some
other
sort
of
thing
care
for
something

life
is

and
though
art
may
be
long
plenty
of
noise
answers
nearly
as
well
i
do
care
for
something
i
mean
somebody
i
said
a
woman
then
marry
her
do
hesitate
i
do
not
know
whether
she
would
marry
me
i
replied
i
have
never
asked
her
then
ask
her
at
once
answered
miss
lammas
i
shall
die
happy
if
i
feel
i
have
persuaded
a
melancholy
to
rouse
himself
to
action
ask
her
by
all
means
and
see
what
she
says
if
she
does
not
accept
you
at
once
she
may
take
you
the
next
time
meanwhile
you
will
have
entered
for
the
race
if
you
lose
there
are
the
trial
stakes
and
the
race
and
plenty
of
selling
races
into
the
bargain
shall
i
take
you
at
your
word
miss
lammas
i
hope
you
will
she
answered
since
you
yourself
advise
me
i
will
miss
lammas
will
you
do
me
the
honour
to
marry
me
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
the
blood
rushed
to
my
head
and
my
sight
swam
i
can
not
tell
why
i
said
it
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
explain
the
extraordinary
fascination
the
girl
exercised
over
me
or
the
still
more
extraordinary
feeling
of
intimacy
with
her
which
had
grown
in
me
during
that
lonely
sad
unlucky
as
i
had
been
all
my
life
i
was
certainly
not
timid
nor
even
shy
but
to
propose
to
marry
a
woman
after
half
an
hour
acquaintance
was
a
piece
of
madness
of
which
i
never
believed
myself
capable
and
of
which
i
should
never
be
capable
again
could
i
be
placed
in
the
same
situation
it
was
as
though
my
whole
being
had
been
changed
in
a
moment
by
magic
by
the
white
magic
of
her
nature
brought
into
contact
with
mine
the
blood
sank
back
to
my
heart
and
a
moment
later
i
found
myself
staring
at
her
with
anxious
eyes
to
my
amazement
she
was
as
calm
as
ever
but
her
beautiful
mouth
smiled
and
there
was
a
mischievous
light
in
her
eyes
fairly
caught
she
answered
for
an
individual
who
pretends
to
be
listless
and
sad
you
are
not
lacking
in
humour
i
had
really
not
the
least
idea
what
you
were
going
to
say
would
it
be
singularly
awkward
for
you
if
i
had
said
i
never
saw
anybody
begin
to
practise
so
sharply
what
was
preached
to
him
with
so
very
little
loss
of
time
you
probably
never
met
a
man
who
had
dreamed
of
you
for
seven
months
before
being
introduced
no
i
never
did
she
answered
gaily
it
smacks
of
the
romantic
perhaps
you
are
a
romantic
character
after
all
i
should
think
you
were
if
i
believed
you
very
well
you
have
taken
my
advice
entered
for
a
stranger
race
and
lost
it
try
the
trial
stakes
you
have
another
cuff
and
a
pencil
propose
to
aunt
bluebell
she
would
dance
with
astonishment
and
she
might
recover
her
hearing
chapter
iii
that
was
how
i
first
asked
margaret
lammas
to
be
my
wife
and
i
will
agree
with
any
one
who
says
i
behaved
very
foolishly
but
i
have
not
repented
of
it
and
i
never
shall
i
have
long
ago
understood
that
i
was
out
of
my
mind
that
evening
but
i
think
my
temporary
insanity
on
that
occasion
has
had
the
effect
of
making
me
a
saner
man
ever
since
her
manner
turned
my
head
for
it
was
so
different
from
what
i
had
expected
to
hear
this
lovely
creature
who
in
my
imagination
was
a
heroine
of
romance
if
not
of
tragedy
talking
familiarly
and
laughing
readily
was
more
than
my
equanimity
could
bear
and
i
lost
my
head
as
well
as
my
heart
but
when
i
went
back
to
england
in
the
spring
i
went
to
make
certain
arrangements
at
the
castle
certain
changes
and
improvements
which
would
be
absolutely
necessary
i
had
won
the
race
for
which
i
had
entered
myself
so
rashly
and
we
were
to
be
married
in
june
whether
the
change
was
due
to
the
orders
i
had
left
with
the
gardener
and
the
rest
of
the
servants
or
to
my
own
state
of
mind
i
can
not
tell
at
all
events
the
old
place
did
not
look
the
same
to
me
when
i
opened
my
window
on
the
morning
after
my
arrival
there
were
the
grey
walls
below
me
and
the
grey
turrets
flanking
the
huge
building
there
were
the
fountains
the
marble
causeways
the
smooth
basins
the
tall
box
hedges
the
and
the
swans
just
as
of
old
but
there
was
something
else
there
too
something
in
the
air
in
the
water
and
in
the
greenness
that
i
did
not
recognise
a
light
over
everything
by
which
everything
was
transfigured
the
clock
in
the
tower
struck
seven
and
the
strokes
of
the
ancient
bell
sounded
like
a
wedding
chime
the
air
sang
with
the
thrilling
treble
of
the
with
the
silvery
music
of
the
plashing
water
and
the
softer
harmony
of
the
leaves
stirred
by
the
fresh
morning
wind
there
was
a
smell
of
hay
from
the
distant
meadows
and
of
blooming
roses
from
the
beds
below
wafted
up
together
to
my
window
i
stood
in
the
pure
sunshine
and
drank
the
air
and
all
the
sounds
and
the
odours
that
were
in
it
and
i
looked
down
at
my
garden
and
said
it
is
paradise
after
all
i
think
the
men
of
old
were
right
when
they
called
heaven
a
garden
and
eden
a
garden
inhabited
by
one
man
and
one
woman
the
earthly
paradise
i
turned
away
wondering
what
had
become
of
the
gloomy
memories
i
had
always
associated
with
my
home
i
tried
to
recall
the
impression
of
my
nurse
horrible
prophecy
before
the
death
of
my
parents
an
impression
which
hitherto
had
been
vivid
enough
i
tried
to
remember
my
own
self
my
dejection
my
listlessness
my
bad
luck
and
my
petty
disappointments
i
endeavoured
to
force
myself
to
think
as
i
used
to
think
if
only
to
satisfy
myself
that
i
had
not
lost
my
individuality
but
i
succeeded
in
none
of
these
efforts
i
was
a
different
man
a
changed
being
incapable
of
sorrow
of
or
of
sadness
my
life
had
been
a
dream
not
evil
but
infinitely
gloomy
and
hopeless
it
was
now
a
reality
full
of
hope
gladness
and
all
manner
of
good
my
home
had
been
like
a
tomb
it
was
paradise
my
heart
had
been
as
though
it
had
not
existed
it
beat
with
strength
and
youth
and
the
certainty
of
realised
happiness
i
revelled
in
the
beauty
of
the
world
and
called
loveliness
out
of
the
future
to
enjoy
it
before
time
should
bring
it
to
me
as
a
traveller
in
the
plains
looks
up
to
the
mountains
and
already
tastes
the
cool
air
through
the
dust
of
the
road
here
i
thought
we
will
live
and
live
for
years
there
we
will
sit
by
the
fountain
towards
evening
and
in
the
deep
moonlight
down
those
paths
we
will
wander
together
on
those
benches
we
will
rest
and
talk
among
those
eastern
hills
we
will
ride
through
the
soft
twilight
and
in
the
old
house
we
will
tell
tales
on
winter
nights
when
the
logs
burn
high
and
the
holly
berries
are
red
and
the
old
clock
tolls
out
the
dying
year
on
these
old
steps
in
these
dark
passages
and
stately
rooms
there
will
one
day
be
the
sound
of
little
pattering
feet
and
laughing
will
ring
up
to
the
vaults
of
the
ancient
hall
those
tiny
footsteps
shall
not
be
slow
and
sad
as
mine
were
nor
shall
the
childish
words
be
spoken
in
an
awed
whisper
no
gloomy
welshwoman
shall
people
the
dusky
corners
with
weird
horrors
nor
utter
horrid
prophecies
of
death
and
ghastly
things
all
shall
be
young
and
fresh
and
joyful
and
happy
and
we
will
turn
the
old
luck
again
and
forget
that
there
was
ever
any
sadness
so
i
thought
as
i
looked
out
of
my
window
that
morning
and
for
many
mornings
after
that
and
every
day
it
all
seemed
more
real
than
ever
before
and
much
nearer
but
the
old
nurse
looked
at
me
askance
and
muttered
odd
sayings
about
the
woman
of
the
water
i
cared
little
what
she
said
for
i
was
far
too
happy
at
last
the
time
came
near
for
the
wedding
lady
bluebell
and
all
the
tribe
of
bluebells
as
margaret
called
them
were
at
bluebell
grange
for
we
had
determined
to
be
married
in
the
country
and
to
come
straight
to
the
castle
afterwards
we
cared
little
for
travelling
and
not
at
all
for
a
crowded
ceremony
at
george
in
hanover
square
with
all
the
tiresome
formalities
afterwards
i
used
to
ride
over
to
the
grange
every
day
and
very
often
margaret
would
come
with
her
aunt
and
some
of
her
cousins
to
the
castle
i
was
suspicious
of
my
own
taste
and
was
only
too
glad
to
let
her
have
her
way
about
the
alterations
and
improvements
in
our
home
we
were
to
be
married
on
the
thirtieth
of
july
and
on
the
evening
of
the
margaret
drove
over
with
some
of
the
bluebell
party
in
the
long
summer
twilight
we
all
went
out
into
the
garden
naturally
enough
margaret
and
i
were
left
to
ourselves
and
we
wandered
down
by
the
marble
basins
it
is
an
odd
coincidence
i
said
it
was
on
this
very
night
last
year
that
i
first
saw
you
considering
that
it
is
the
month
of
july
answered
margaret
with
a
laugh
and
that
we
have
been
here
almost
every
day
i
do
think
the
coincidence
is
so
extraordinary
after
all
no
dear
said
i
i
suppose
not
i
do
know
why
it
struck
me
we
shall
very
likely
be
here
a
year
from
and
a
year
from
that
the
odd
thing
when
i
think
of
it
is
that
you
should
be
here
at
all
but
my
luck
has
turned
i
ought
not
to
think
anything
odd
that
happens
now
that
i
have
you
it
is
all
sure
to
be
good
a
slight
change
in
your
ideas
since
that
remarkable
performance
of
yours
in
paris
said
margaret
do
you
know
i
thought
you
were
the
most
extraordinary
man
i
had
ever
met
i
thought
you
were
the
most
charming
woman
i
have
ever
seen
i
naturally
did
not
want
to
lose
any
time
in
frivolities
i
took
you
at
your
word
i
followed
your
advice
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
and
this
is
the
delightful
result
what
the
matter
margaret
had
started
suddenly
and
her
hand
tightened
on
my
arm
an
old
woman
was
coming
up
the
path
and
was
close
to
us
before
we
saw
her
for
the
moon
had
risen
and
was
shining
full
in
our
faces
the
woman
turned
out
to
be
my
old
nurse
it
only
old
judith
dear
do
be
frightened
i
said
then
i
spoke
to
the
welshwoman
what
are
you
about
judith
have
you
been
feeding
the
woman
of
the
water
ay
when
the
clock
strikes
willie
my
lord
i
mean
muttered
the
old
creature
drawing
aside
to
let
us
pass
and
fixing
her
strange
eyes
on
margaret
face
what
does
she
mean
asked
margaret
when
we
had
gone
by
nothing
darling
the
old
thing
is
mildly
crazy
but
she
is
a
good
soul
we
went
on
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
came
to
the
rustic
bridge
just
above
the
artificial
grotto
through
which
the
water
ran
out
into
the
park
dark
and
swift
in
its
narrow
channel
we
stopped
and
leaned
on
the
wooden
rail
the
moon
was
now
behind
us
and
shone
full
upon
the
long
vista
of
basins
and
on
the
huge
walls
and
towers
of
the
castle
above
how
proud
you
ought
to
be
of
such
a
grand
old
place
said
margaret
softly
it
is
yours
now
darling
i
answered
you
have
as
good
a
right
to
love
it
as
i
but
i
only
love
it
because
you
are
to
live
in
it
dear
her
hand
stole
out
and
lay
on
mine
and
we
were
both
silent
just
then
the
clock
began
to
strike
far
off
in
the
tower
i
counted
the
strokes
eight
nine
ten
eleven
i
looked
at
my
watch
twelve
thirteen
i
laughed
the
bell
went
on
striking
the
old
clock
has
gone
crazy
like
judith
i
exclaimed
still
it
went
on
note
after
note
ringing
out
monotonously
through
the
still
air
we
leaned
over
the
rail
instinctively
looking
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
came
on
and
on
it
went
i
counted
nearly
a
hundred
out
of
sheer
curiosity
for
i
understood
that
something
had
broken
and
that
the
thing
was
running
itself
down
suddenly
there
was
a
crack
as
of
breaking
wood
a
cry
and
a
heavy
splash
and
i
was
alone
clinging
to
the
broken
end
of
the
rail
of
the
rustic
bridge
i
do
not
think
i
hesitated
while
my
pulse
beat
twice
i
sprang
clear
of
the
bridge
into
the
black
rushing
water
dived
to
the
bottom
came
up
again
with
empty
hands
turned
and
swam
downwards
through
the
grotto
in
the
thick
darkness
plunging
and
diving
at
every
stroke
striking
my
head
and
hands
against
jagged
stones
and
sharp
corners
clutching
at
last
something
in
my
fingers
and
dragging
it
up
with
all
my
might
i
spoke
i
cried
aloud
but
there
was
no
answer
i
was
alone
in
the
pitchy
blackness
with
my
burden
and
the
house
was
five
hundred
yards
away
struggling
still
i
felt
the
ground
beneath
my
feet
i
saw
a
ray
of
moonlight
the
grotto
widened
and
the
deep
water
became
a
broad
and
shallow
brook
as
i
stumbled
over
the
stones
and
at
last
laid
body
on
the
bank
in
the
park
beyond
ay
willie
as
the
clock
struck
said
the
voice
of
judith
the
welsh
nurse
as
she
bent
down
and
looked
at
the
white
face
the
old
woman
must
have
turned
back
and
followed
us
seen
the
accident
and
slipped
out
by
the
lower
gate
of
the
garden
ay
she
groaned
you
have
fed
the
woman
of
the
water
this
night
willie
while
the
clock
was
striking
i
scarcely
heard
her
as
i
knelt
beside
the
lifeless
body
of
the
woman
i
loved
chafing
the
wet
white
temples
and
gazing
wildly
into
the
eyes
i
remember
only
the
first
returning
look
of
consciousness
the
first
heaving
breath
the
first
movement
of
those
dear
hands
stretching
out
towards
me
that
is
not
much
of
a
story
you
say
it
is
the
story
of
my
life
that
is
all
it
does
not
pretend
to
be
anything
else
old
judith
says
my
luck
turned
on
that
summer
night
when
i
was
struggling
in
the
water
to
save
all
that
was
worth
living
for
a
month
later
there
was
a
stone
bridge
above
the
grotto
and
margaret
and
i
stood
on
it
and
looked
up
at
the
moonlit
castle
as
we
had
done
once
before
and
as
we
have
done
many
times
since
for
all
those
things
happened
ten
years
ago
last
summer
and
this
is
the
tenth
christmas
eve
we
have
spent
together
by
the
roaring
logs
in
the
old
hall
talking
of
old
times
and
every
year
there
are
more
old
times
to
talk
of
there
are
boys
too
with
hair
and
eyes
like
their
mother
and
a
little
margaret
with
solemn
black
eyes
like
mine
why
could
she
not
look
like
her
mother
too
as
well
as
the
rest
of
them
the
world
is
very
bright
at
this
glorious
christmas
time
and
perhaps
there
is
little
use
in
calling
up
the
sadness
of
long
ago
unless
it
be
to
make
the
jolly
firelight
seem
more
cheerful
the
good
wife
face
look
gladder
and
to
give
the
children
laughter
a
merrier
ring
by
contrast
with
all
that
is
gone
perhaps
too
some
listless
melancholy
youth
who
feels
that
the
world
is
very
hollow
and
that
life
is
like
a
perpetual
funeral
service
just
as
i
used
to
feel
myself
may
take
courage
from
my
example
and
having
found
the
woman
of
his
heart
ask
her
to
marry
him
after
half
an
hour
acquaintance
but
on
the
whole
i
would
not
advise
any
man
to
marry
for
the
simple
reason
that
no
man
will
ever
find
a
wife
like
mine
and
being
obliged
to
go
further
he
will
necessarily
fare
worse
my
wife
has
done
miracles
but
i
will
not
assert
that
any
other
woman
is
able
to
follow
her
example
margaret
always
said
that
the
old
place
was
beautiful
and
that
i
ought
to
be
proud
of
it
i
dare
say
she
is
right
she
has
even
more
imagination
than
i
but
i
have
a
good
answer
and
a
plain
one
which
is
this
that
all
the
beauty
of
the
castle
comes
from
her
she
has
breathed
upon
it
all
as
the
children
blow
upon
the
cold
glass
in
winter
and
as
their
warm
breath
crystallises
into
landscapes
from
fairyland
full
of
exquisite
shapes
and
traceries
upon
the
blank
surface
so
her
spirit
has
transformed
every
grey
stone
of
the
old
towers
every
ancient
tree
and
hedge
in
the
gardens
every
thought
in
my
once
melancholy
self
all
that
was
old
is
young
and
all
that
was
sad
is
glad
and
i
am
the
gladdest
of
all
whatever
heaven
may
be
there
is
no
earthly
paradise
without
woman
nor
is
there
anywhere
a
place
so
desolate
so
dreary
so
unutterably
miserable
that
a
woman
can
not
make
it
seem
heaven
to
the
man
she
loves
and
who
loves
her
i
hear
certain
cynics
laugh
and
cry
that
all
that
has
been
said
before
do
not
laugh
my
good
cynic
you
are
too
small
a
man
to
laugh
at
such
a
great
thing
as
love
prayers
have
been
said
before
now
by
many
and
perhaps
you
say
yours
too
i
do
not
think
they
lose
anything
by
being
repeated
nor
you
by
repeating
them
you
say
that
the
world
is
bitter
and
full
of
the
waters
of
bitterness
love
and
so
live
that
you
may
be
loved
the
world
will
turn
sweet
for
you
and
you
shall
rest
like
me
by
the
waters
of
paradise
the
doll
ghost
it
was
a
terrible
accident
and
for
one
moment
the
splendid
machinery
of
cranston
house
got
out
of
gear
and
stood
still
the
butler
emerged
from
the
retirement
in
which
he
spent
his
elegant
leisure
two
grooms
of
the
chambers
appeared
simultaneously
from
opposite
directions
there
were
actually
housemaids
on
the
grand
staircase
and
those
who
remember
the
facts
most
exactly
assert
that
pringle
herself
positively
stood
upon
the
landing
pringle
was
the
housekeeper
as
for
the
head
nurse
the
under
nurse
and
the
nursery
maid
their
feelings
can
not
be
described
the
head
nurse
laid
one
hand
upon
the
polished
marble
balustrade
and
stared
stupidly
before
her
the
under
nurse
stood
rigid
and
pale
leaning
against
the
polished
marble
wall
and
the
collapsed
and
sat
down
upon
the
polished
marble
step
just
beyond
the
limits
of
the
velvet
carpet
and
frankly
burst
into
tears
the
lady
gwendolen
youngest
daughter
of
the
ninth
duke
of
cranston
and
aged
six
years
and
three
months
picked
herself
up
quite
alone
and
sat
down
on
the
third
step
from
the
foot
of
the
grand
staircase
in
cranston
house
oh
ejaculated
the
butler
and
he
disappeared
again
ah
responded
the
grooms
of
the
chambers
as
they
also
went
away
it
only
that
doll
pringle
was
distinctly
heard
to
say
in
a
tone
of
contempt
the
under
nurse
heard
her
say
it
then
the
three
nurses
gathered
round
lady
gwendolen
and
patted
her
and
gave
her
unhealthy
things
out
of
their
pockets
and
hurried
her
out
of
cranston
house
as
fast
as
they
could
lest
it
should
be
found
out
upstairs
that
they
had
allowed
the
lady
gwendolen
to
tumble
down
the
grand
staircase
with
her
doll
in
her
arms
and
as
the
doll
was
badly
broken
the
carried
it
with
the
pieces
wrapped
up
in
lady
gwendolen
little
cloak
it
was
not
far
to
hyde
park
and
when
they
had
reached
a
quiet
place
they
took
means
to
find
out
that
lady
gwendolen
had
no
bruises
for
the
carpet
was
very
thick
and
soft
and
there
was
thick
stuff
under
it
to
make
it
softer
lady
gwendolen
sometimes
yelled
but
she
never
cried
it
was
because
she
had
yelled
that
the
nurse
had
allowed
her
to
go
downstairs
alone
with
nina
the
doll
under
one
arm
while
she
steadied
herself
with
her
other
hand
on
the
balustrade
and
trod
upon
the
polished
marble
steps
beyond
the
edge
of
the
carpet
so
she
had
fallen
and
nina
had
come
to
grief
when
the
nurses
were
quite
sure
that
she
was
not
hurt
they
unwrapped
the
doll
and
looked
at
her
in
her
turn
she
had
been
a
very
beautiful
doll
very
large
and
fair
and
healthy
with
real
yellow
hair
and
eyelids
that
would
open
and
shut
over
very
dark
eyes
moreover
when
you
moved
her
right
arm
up
and
down
she
said
and
when
you
moved
the
left
she
said
very
distinctly
i
heard
her
say
when
she
fell
said
the
under
nurse
who
heard
everything
but
she
ought
to
have
said
that
because
her
arm
went
up
when
she
hit
the
step
said
the
head
nurse
she
say
the
other
when
i
put
it
down
again
pa
said
nina
as
her
right
arm
was
pushed
down
and
speaking
through
her
broken
face
it
was
cracked
right
across
from
the
upper
corner
of
the
forehead
with
a
hideous
gash
through
the
nose
and
down
to
the
little
frilled
collar
of
the
pale
green
silk
mother
hubbard
frock
and
two
little
pieces
of
porcelain
had
fallen
out
i
sure
it
a
wonder
she
can
speak
at
all
being
all
smashed
said
the
under
nurse
you
have
to
take
her
to
puckler
said
her
superior
it
not
far
and
you
better
go
at
once
lady
gwendolen
was
occupied
in
digging
a
hole
in
the
ground
with
a
little
spade
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
nurses
what
are
you
doing
enquired
the
looking
on
nina
dead
and
i
diggin
her
a
grave
replied
her
ladyship
thoughtfully
oh
she
come
to
life
again
all
right
said
the
the
under
nurse
wrapped
nina
up
again
and
departed
fortunately
a
kind
soldier
with
very
long
legs
and
a
very
small
cap
happened
to
be
there
and
as
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
offered
to
see
the
under
nurse
safely
to
puckler
and
back
bernard
puckler
and
his
little
daughter
lived
in
a
little
house
in
a
little
alley
which
led
out
off
a
quiet
little
street
not
very
far
from
belgrave
square
he
was
the
great
doll
doctor
and
his
extensive
practice
lay
in
the
most
aristocratic
quarter
he
mended
dolls
of
all
sizes
and
ages
boy
dolls
and
girl
dolls
baby
dolls
in
long
clothes
and
dolls
in
fashionable
gowns
talking
dolls
and
dumb
dolls
those
that
shut
their
eyes
when
they
lay
down
and
those
whose
eyes
had
to
be
shut
for
them
by
means
of
a
mysterious
wire
his
daughter
else
was
only
just
over
twelve
years
old
but
she
was
already
very
clever
at
mending
dolls
clothes
and
at
doing
their
hair
which
is
harder
than
you
might
think
though
the
dolls
sit
quite
still
while
it
is
being
done
puckler
had
originally
been
a
german
but
he
had
dissolved
his
nationality
in
the
ocean
of
london
many
years
ago
like
a
great
many
foreigners
he
still
had
one
or
two
german
friends
however
who
came
on
saturday
evenings
and
smoked
with
him
and
played
picquet
or
skat
with
him
for
farthing
points
and
called
him
herr
doctor
which
seemed
to
please
puckler
very
much
he
looked
older
than
he
was
for
his
beard
was
rather
long
and
ragged
his
hair
was
grizzled
and
thin
and
he
wore
spectacles
as
for
else
she
was
a
thin
pale
child
very
quiet
and
neat
with
dark
eyes
and
brown
hair
that
was
plaited
down
her
back
and
tied
with
a
bit
of
black
ribbon
she
mended
the
dolls
clothes
and
took
the
dolls
back
to
their
homes
when
they
were
quite
strong
again
the
house
was
a
little
one
but
too
big
for
the
two
people
who
lived
in
it
there
was
a
small
on
the
street
and
the
workshop
was
at
the
back
and
there
were
three
rooms
upstairs
but
the
father
and
daughter
lived
most
of
their
time
in
the
workshop
because
they
were
generally
at
work
even
in
the
evenings
puckler
laid
nina
on
the
table
and
looked
at
her
a
long
time
till
the
tears
began
to
fill
his
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
he
was
a
very
susceptible
man
and
he
often
fell
in
love
with
the
dolls
he
mended
and
found
it
hard
to
part
with
them
when
they
had
smiled
at
him
for
a
few
days
they
were
real
little
people
to
him
with
characters
and
thoughts
and
feelings
of
their
own
and
he
was
very
tender
with
them
all
but
some
attracted
him
especially
from
the
first
and
when
they
were
brought
to
him
maimed
and
injured
their
state
seemed
so
pitiful
to
him
that
the
tears
came
easily
you
must
remember
that
he
had
lived
among
dolls
during
a
great
part
of
his
life
and
understood
them
how
do
you
know
that
they
feel
nothing
he
went
on
to
say
to
else
you
must
be
gentle
with
them
it
costs
nothing
to
be
kind
to
the
little
beings
and
perhaps
it
makes
a
difference
to
them
and
else
understood
him
because
she
was
a
child
and
she
knew
that
she
was
more
to
him
than
all
the
dolls
he
fell
in
love
with
nina
at
first
sight
perhaps
because
her
beautiful
brown
glass
eyes
were
something
like
else
own
and
he
loved
else
first
and
best
with
all
his
heart
and
besides
it
was
a
very
sorrowful
case
nina
had
evidently
not
been
long
in
the
world
for
her
complexion
was
perfect
her
hair
was
smooth
where
it
should
be
smooth
and
curly
where
it
should
be
curly
and
her
silk
clothes
were
perfectly
new
but
across
her
face
was
that
frightful
gash
like
a
deep
and
shadowy
within
but
clean
and
sharp
at
the
edges
when
he
tenderly
pressed
her
head
to
close
the
gaping
wound
the
edges
made
a
fine
grating
sound
that
was
painful
to
hear
and
the
lids
of
the
dark
eyes
quivered
and
trembled
as
though
nina
were
suffering
dreadfully
poor
nina
he
exclaimed
sorrowfully
but
i
shall
not
hurt
you
much
though
you
will
take
a
long
time
to
get
strong
he
always
asked
the
names
of
the
broken
dolls
when
they
were
brought
to
him
and
sometimes
the
people
knew
what
the
children
called
them
and
told
him
he
liked
nina
for
a
name
altogether
and
in
every
way
she
pleased
him
more
than
any
doll
he
had
seen
for
many
years
and
he
felt
drawn
to
her
and
made
up
his
mind
to
make
her
perfectly
strong
and
sound
no
matter
how
much
labour
it
might
cost
him
puckler
worked
patiently
a
little
at
a
time
and
else
watched
him
she
could
do
nothing
for
poor
nina
whose
clothes
needed
no
mending
the
longer
the
doll
doctor
worked
the
more
fond
he
became
of
the
yellow
hair
and
the
beautiful
brown
glass
eyes
he
sometimes
forgot
all
the
other
dolls
that
were
waiting
to
be
mended
lying
side
by
side
on
a
shelf
and
sat
for
an
hour
gazing
at
nina
face
while
he
racked
his
ingenuity
for
some
new
invention
by
which
to
hide
even
the
smallest
trace
of
the
terrible
accident
she
was
wonderfully
mended
even
he
was
obliged
to
admit
that
but
the
scar
was
still
visible
to
his
keen
eyes
a
very
fine
line
right
across
the
face
downwards
from
right
to
left
yet
all
the
conditions
had
been
most
favourable
for
a
cure
since
the
cement
had
set
quite
hard
at
the
first
attempt
and
the
weather
had
been
fine
and
dry
which
makes
a
great
difference
in
a
dolls
hospital
at
last
he
knew
that
he
could
do
no
more
and
the
under
nurse
had
already
come
twice
to
see
whether
the
job
was
finished
as
she
coarsely
expressed
it
nina
is
not
quite
strong
yet
puckler
had
answered
each
time
for
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
face
the
parting
and
now
he
sat
before
the
square
deal
table
at
which
he
worked
and
nina
lay
before
him
for
the
last
time
with
a
big
brown
paper
box
beside
her
it
stood
there
like
her
coffin
waiting
for
her
he
thought
he
must
put
her
into
it
and
lay
tissue
paper
over
her
dear
face
and
then
put
on
the
lid
and
at
the
thought
of
tying
the
string
his
sight
was
dim
with
tears
again
he
was
never
to
look
into
the
glassy
depths
of
the
beautiful
brown
eyes
any
more
nor
to
hear
the
little
wooden
voice
say
and
it
was
a
very
painful
moment
in
the
vain
hope
of
gaining
time
before
the
separation
he
took
up
the
little
sticky
bottles
of
cement
and
glue
and
gum
and
colour
looking
at
each
one
in
turn
and
then
at
nina
face
and
all
his
small
tools
lay
there
neatly
arranged
in
a
row
but
he
knew
that
he
could
not
use
them
again
for
nina
she
was
quite
strong
at
last
and
in
a
country
where
there
should
be
no
cruel
children
to
hurt
her
she
might
live
a
hundred
years
with
only
that
almost
imperceptible
line
across
her
face
to
tell
of
the
fearful
thing
that
had
befallen
her
on
the
marble
steps
of
cranston
house
suddenly
puckler
heart
was
quite
full
and
he
rose
abruptly
from
his
seat
and
turned
away
else
he
said
unsteadily
you
must
do
it
for
me
i
can
not
bear
to
see
her
go
into
the
box
so
he
went
and
stood
at
the
window
with
his
back
turned
while
else
did
what
he
had
not
the
heart
to
do
is
it
done
he
asked
not
turning
round
then
take
her
away
my
dear
put
on
your
hat
and
take
her
to
cranston
house
quickly
and
when
you
are
gone
i
will
turn
round
else
was
used
to
her
father
queer
ways
with
the
dolls
and
though
she
had
never
seen
him
so
much
moved
by
a
parting
she
was
not
much
surprised
come
back
quickly
he
said
when
he
heard
her
hand
on
the
latch
it
is
growing
late
and
i
should
not
send
you
at
this
hour
but
i
can
not
bear
to
look
forward
to
it
any
more
when
else
was
gone
he
left
the
window
and
sat
down
in
his
place
before
the
table
again
to
wait
for
the
child
to
come
back
he
touched
the
place
where
nina
had
lain
very
gently
and
he
recalled
the
softly
tinted
pink
face
and
the
glass
eyes
and
the
ringlets
of
yellow
hair
till
he
could
almost
see
them
the
evenings
were
long
for
it
was
late
in
the
spring
but
it
began
to
grow
dark
soon
and
puckler
wondered
why
else
did
not
come
back
she
had
been
gone
an
hour
and
a
half
and
that
was
much
longer
than
he
had
expected
for
it
was
barely
half
a
mile
from
belgrave
square
to
cranston
house
he
reflected
that
the
child
might
have
been
kept
waiting
but
as
the
twilight
deepened
he
grew
anxious
and
walked
up
and
down
in
the
dim
workshop
no
longer
thinking
of
nina
but
of
else
his
own
living
child
whom
he
loved
an
undefinable
disquieting
sensation
came
upon
him
by
fine
degrees
a
chilliness
and
a
faint
stirring
of
his
thin
hair
joined
with
a
wish
to
be
in
any
company
rather
than
to
be
alone
much
longer
it
was
the
beginning
of
fear
he
told
himself
in
strong
that
he
was
a
foolish
old
man
and
he
began
to
feel
about
for
the
matches
in
the
dusk
he
knew
just
where
they
should
be
for
he
always
kept
them
in
the
same
place
close
to
the
little
tin
box
that
held
bits
of
of
various
colours
for
some
kinds
of
mending
but
somehow
he
could
not
find
the
matches
in
the
gloom
something
had
happened
to
else
he
was
sure
and
as
his
fear
increased
he
felt
as
though
it
might
be
allayed
if
he
could
get
a
light
and
see
what
time
it
was
then
he
called
himself
a
foolish
old
man
again
and
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
startled
him
in
the
dark
he
could
not
find
the
matches
the
window
was
grey
still
he
might
see
what
time
it
was
if
he
went
close
to
it
and
he
could
go
and
get
matches
out
of
the
cupboard
afterwards
he
stood
back
from
the
table
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
chair
and
began
to
cross
the
board
floor
something
was
following
him
in
the
dark
there
was
a
small
pattering
as
of
tiny
feet
upon
the
boards
he
stopped
and
listened
and
the
roots
of
his
hair
tingled
it
was
nothing
and
he
was
a
foolish
old
man
he
made
two
steps
more
and
he
was
sure
that
he
heard
the
little
pattering
again
he
turned
his
back
to
the
window
leaning
against
the
sash
so
that
the
panes
began
to
crack
and
he
faced
the
dark
everything
was
quite
still
and
it
smelt
of
paste
and
cement
and
as
usual
is
that
you
else
he
asked
and
he
was
surprised
by
the
fear
in
his
voice
there
was
no
answer
in
the
room
and
he
held
up
his
watch
and
tried
to
make
out
what
time
it
was
by
the
grey
dusk
that
was
just
not
darkness
so
far
as
he
could
see
it
was
within
two
or
three
minutes
of
ten
he
had
been
a
long
time
alone
he
was
shocked
and
frightened
for
else
out
in
london
so
late
and
he
almost
ran
across
the
room
to
the
door
as
he
fumbled
for
the
latch
he
distinctly
heard
the
running
of
the
little
feet
after
him
mice
he
exclaimed
feebly
just
as
he
got
the
door
open
he
shut
it
quickly
behind
him
and
felt
as
though
some
cold
thing
had
settled
on
his
back
and
were
writhing
upon
him
the
passage
was
quite
dark
but
he
found
his
hat
and
was
out
in
the
alley
in
a
moment
breathing
more
freely
and
surprised
to
find
how
much
light
there
still
was
in
the
open
air
he
could
see
the
pavement
clearly
under
his
feet
and
far
off
in
the
street
to
which
the
alley
led
he
could
hear
the
laughter
and
calls
of
children
playing
some
game
out
of
doors
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
so
nervous
and
for
an
instant
he
thought
of
going
back
into
the
house
to
wait
quietly
for
else
but
instantly
he
felt
that
nervous
fright
of
something
stealing
over
him
again
in
any
case
it
was
better
to
walk
up
to
cranston
house
and
ask
the
servants
about
the
child
one
of
the
women
had
perhaps
taken
a
fancy
to
her
and
was
even
now
giving
her
tea
and
cake
he
walked
quickly
to
belgrave
square
and
then
up
the
broad
streets
listening
as
he
went
whenever
there
was
no
other
sound
for
the
tiny
footsteps
but
he
heard
nothing
and
was
laughing
at
himself
when
he
rang
the
servants
bell
at
the
big
house
of
course
the
child
must
be
there
the
person
who
opened
the
door
was
quite
an
inferior
person
for
it
was
a
back
door
but
affected
the
manners
of
the
front
and
stared
at
puckler
superciliously
under
the
strong
light
no
little
girl
had
been
seen
and
he
knew
nothing
about
no
dolls
she
is
my
little
girl
said
puckler
tremulously
for
all
his
anxiety
was
returning
tenfold
and
i
am
afraid
something
has
happened
the
inferior
person
said
rudely
that
nothing
could
have
happened
to
her
in
that
house
because
she
had
not
been
there
which
was
a
jolly
good
reason
why
and
puckler
was
obliged
to
admit
that
the
man
ought
to
know
as
it
was
his
business
to
keep
the
door
and
let
people
in
he
wished
to
be
allowed
to
speak
to
the
under
nurse
who
knew
him
but
the
man
was
ruder
than
ever
and
finally
shut
the
door
in
his
face
when
the
doll
doctor
was
alone
in
the
street
he
steadied
himself
by
the
railing
for
he
felt
as
though
he
were
breaking
in
two
just
as
some
dolls
break
in
the
middle
of
the
backbone
presently
he
knew
that
he
must
be
doing
something
to
find
else
and
that
gave
him
strength
he
began
to
walk
as
quickly
as
he
could
through
the
streets
following
every
highway
and
byway
which
his
little
girl
might
have
taken
on
her
errand
he
also
asked
several
policemen
in
vain
if
they
had
seen
her
and
most
of
them
answered
him
kindly
for
they
saw
that
he
was
a
sober
man
and
in
his
right
senses
and
some
of
them
had
little
girls
of
their
own
it
was
one
in
the
morning
when
he
went
up
to
his
own
door
again
worn
out
and
hopeless
and
as
he
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
his
heart
stood
still
for
he
knew
that
he
was
awake
and
not
dreaming
and
that
he
really
heard
those
tiny
footsteps
pattering
to
meet
him
inside
the
house
along
the
passage
but
he
was
too
unhappy
to
be
much
frightened
any
more
and
his
heart
went
on
again
with
a
dull
regular
pain
that
found
its
way
all
through
him
with
every
pulse
so
he
went
in
and
hung
up
his
hat
in
the
dark
and
found
the
matches
in
the
cupboard
and
the
candlestick
in
its
place
in
the
corner
puckler
was
so
much
overcome
and
so
completely
worn
out
that
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
before
the
and
almost
fainted
as
his
face
dropped
forward
upon
his
folded
hands
beside
him
the
solitary
candle
burned
steadily
with
a
low
flame
in
the
still
warm
air
else
else
he
moaned
against
his
yellow
knuckles
and
that
was
all
he
could
say
and
it
was
no
relief
to
him
on
the
contrary
the
very
sound
of
the
name
was
a
new
and
sharp
pain
that
pierced
his
ears
and
his
head
and
his
very
soul
for
every
time
he
repeated
the
name
it
meant
that
little
else
was
dead
somewhere
out
in
the
streets
of
london
in
the
dark
he
was
so
terribly
hurt
that
he
did
not
even
feel
something
pulling
gently
at
the
skirt
of
his
old
coat
so
gently
that
it
was
like
the
nibbling
of
a
tiny
mouse
he
might
have
thought
that
it
was
really
a
mouse
if
he
had
noticed
it
else
else
he
groaned
right
against
his
hands
then
a
cool
breath
stirred
his
thin
hair
and
the
low
flame
of
the
one
candle
dropped
down
almost
to
a
mere
spark
not
flickering
as
though
a
draught
were
going
to
blow
it
out
but
just
dropping
down
as
if
it
were
tired
out
puckler
felt
his
hands
stiffening
with
fright
under
his
face
and
there
was
a
faint
rustling
sound
like
some
small
silk
thing
blown
in
a
gentle
breeze
he
sat
up
straight
stark
and
scared
and
a
small
wooden
voice
spoke
in
the
stillness
it
said
with
a
break
between
the
syllables
puckler
stood
up
in
a
single
jump
and
his
chair
fell
over
backwards
with
a
smashing
noise
upon
the
wooden
floor
the
candle
had
almost
gone
out
it
was
nina
doll
voice
that
had
spoken
and
he
should
have
known
it
among
the
voices
of
a
hundred
other
dolls
and
yet
there
was
something
more
in
it
a
little
human
ring
with
a
pitiful
cry
and
a
call
for
help
and
the
wail
of
a
hurt
child
puckler
stood
up
stark
and
stiff
and
tried
to
look
round
but
at
first
he
could
not
for
he
seemed
to
be
frozen
from
head
to
foot
then
he
made
a
great
effort
and
he
raised
one
hand
to
each
of
his
temples
and
pressed
his
own
head
round
as
he
would
have
turned
a
doll
the
candle
was
burning
so
low
that
it
might
as
well
have
been
out
altogether
for
any
light
it
gave
and
the
room
seemed
quite
dark
at
first
then
he
saw
something
he
would
not
have
believed
that
he
could
be
more
frightened
than
he
had
been
just
before
that
but
he
was
and
his
knees
shook
for
he
saw
the
doll
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
shining
with
a
faint
and
ghostly
radiance
her
beautiful
glassy
brown
eyes
fixed
on
his
and
across
her
face
the
very
thin
line
of
the
break
he
had
mended
shone
as
though
it
were
drawn
in
light
with
a
fine
point
of
white
flame
yet
there
was
something
more
in
the
eyes
too
there
was
something
human
like
else
own
but
as
if
only
the
doll
saw
him
through
them
and
not
else
and
there
was
enough
of
else
to
bring
back
all
his
pain
and
to
make
him
forget
his
fear
else
my
little
else
he
cried
aloud
the
small
ghost
moved
and
its
slowly
rose
and
fell
with
a
stiff
mechanical
motion
it
said
it
seemed
this
time
that
there
was
even
more
of
else
tone
echoing
somewhere
between
the
wooden
notes
that
reached
his
ears
so
distinctly
and
yet
so
far
away
else
was
calling
him
he
was
sure
his
face
was
perfectly
white
in
the
gloom
but
his
knees
did
not
shake
any
more
and
he
felt
that
he
was
less
frightened
yes
child
but
where
where
he
asked
where
are
you
else
the
syllables
died
away
in
the
quiet
room
there
was
a
low
rustling
of
silk
the
glassy
brown
eyes
turned
slowly
away
and
puckler
heard
the
of
the
small
feet
in
the
bronze
kid
slippers
as
the
figure
ran
straight
to
the
door
then
the
candle
burned
high
again
the
room
was
full
of
light
and
he
was
alone
puckler
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
looked
about
him
he
could
see
everything
quite
clearly
and
he
felt
that
he
must
have
been
dreaming
though
he
was
standing
instead
of
sitting
down
as
he
should
have
been
if
he
had
just
waked
up
the
candle
burned
brightly
now
there
were
the
dolls
to
be
mended
lying
in
a
row
with
their
toes
up
the
third
one
had
lost
her
right
shoe
and
else
was
making
one
he
knew
that
and
he
was
certainly
not
dreaming
now
he
had
not
been
dreaming
when
he
had
come
in
from
his
fruitless
search
and
had
heard
the
footsteps
running
to
the
door
he
had
not
fallen
asleep
in
his
chair
how
could
he
possibly
have
fallen
asleep
when
his
heart
was
breaking
he
had
been
awake
all
the
time
he
steadied
himself
set
the
fallen
chair
upon
its
legs
and
said
to
himself
again
very
emphatically
that
he
was
a
foolish
old
man
he
ought
to
be
out
in
the
streets
looking
for
his
child
asking
questions
and
enquiring
at
the
police
stations
where
all
accidents
were
reported
as
soon
as
they
were
known
or
at
the
hospitals
the
longing
wailing
pitiful
little
wooden
cry
rang
from
the
passage
outside
the
door
and
puckler
stood
for
an
instant
with
white
face
transfixed
and
rooted
to
the
spot
a
moment
later
his
hand
was
on
the
latch
then
he
was
in
the
passage
with
the
light
streaming
from
the
open
door
behind
him
quite
at
the
other
end
he
saw
the
little
phantom
shining
clearly
in
the
shadow
and
the
right
hand
seemed
to
beckon
to
him
as
the
arm
rose
and
fell
once
more
he
knew
all
at
once
that
it
had
not
come
to
frighten
him
but
to
lead
him
and
when
it
disappeared
and
he
walked
boldly
towards
the
door
he
knew
that
it
was
in
the
street
outside
waiting
for
him
he
forgot
that
he
was
tired
and
had
eaten
no
supper
and
had
walked
many
miles
for
a
sudden
hope
ran
through
and
through
him
like
a
golden
stream
of
life
and
sure
enough
at
the
corner
of
the
alley
and
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
out
in
belgrave
square
he
saw
the
small
ghost
flitting
before
him
sometimes
it
was
only
a
shadow
where
there
was
other
light
but
then
the
glare
of
the
lamps
made
a
pale
green
sheen
on
its
little
mother
hubbard
frock
of
silk
and
sometimes
where
the
streets
were
dark
and
silent
the
whole
figure
shone
out
brightly
with
its
yellow
curls
and
rosy
neck
it
seemed
to
trot
along
like
a
tiny
child
and
puckler
could
almost
hear
the
pattering
of
the
bronze
kid
slippers
on
the
pavement
as
it
ran
but
it
went
very
fast
and
he
could
only
just
keep
up
with
it
tearing
along
with
his
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
thin
hair
blown
by
the
night
breeze
and
his
spectacles
firmly
set
upon
his
broad
nose
on
and
on
he
went
and
he
had
no
idea
where
he
was
he
did
not
even
care
for
he
knew
certainly
that
he
was
going
the
right
way
then
at
last
in
a
wide
quiet
street
he
was
standing
before
a
big
door
that
had
two
lamps
on
each
side
of
it
and
a
polished
brass
which
he
pulled
and
just
inside
when
the
door
was
opened
in
the
bright
light
there
was
the
little
shadow
and
the
pale
green
sheen
of
the
little
silk
dress
and
once
more
the
small
cry
came
to
his
ears
less
pitiful
more
longing
the
shadow
turned
suddenly
bright
and
out
of
the
brightness
the
beautiful
brown
glass
eyes
were
turned
up
happily
to
his
while
the
rosy
mouth
smiled
so
divinely
that
the
phantom
doll
looked
almost
like
a
little
angel
just
then
a
little
girl
was
brought
in
soon
after
ten
said
the
quiet
voice
of
the
hospital
doorkeeper
i
think
they
thought
she
was
only
stunned
she
was
holding
a
big
box
against
her
and
they
could
not
get
it
out
of
her
arms
she
had
a
long
plait
of
brown
hair
that
hung
down
as
they
carried
her
she
is
my
little
girl
said
puckler
but
he
hardly
heard
his
own
voice
he
leaned
over
else
face
in
the
gentle
light
of
the
children
ward
and
when
he
had
stood
there
a
minute
the
beautiful
brown
eyes
opened
and
looked
up
to
his
cried
else
softly
i
knew
you
would
come
then
puckler
did
not
know
what
he
did
or
said
for
a
moment
and
what
he
felt
was
worth
all
the
fear
and
terror
and
despair
that
had
almost
killed
him
that
night
but
by
and
by
else
was
telling
her
story
and
the
nurse
let
her
speak
for
there
were
only
two
other
children
in
the
room
who
were
getting
well
and
were
sound
asleep
they
were
big
boys
with
bad
faces
said
else
and
they
tried
to
get
nina
away
from
me
but
i
held
on
and
fought
as
well
as
i
could
till
one
of
them
hit
me
with
something
and
i
do
remember
any
more
for
i
tumbled
down
and
i
suppose
the
boys
ran
away
and
somebody
found
me
there
but
i
afraid
nina
is
all
smashed
here
is
the
box
said
the
nurse
we
could
not
take
it
out
of
her
arms
till
she
came
to
herself
should
you
like
to
see
if
the
doll
is
broken
and
she
undid
the
string
cleverly
but
nina
was
all
smashed
to
pieces
only
the
gentle
light
of
the
children
ward
made
a
pale
green
sheen
in
the
folds
of
the
little
mother
hubbard
frock
